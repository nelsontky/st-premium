    <p>Sin­ga­pore con­tin­ued to have wet and cold weather in the new year, with the mer­cury dip­ping be­low 22 deg C in some places as thun­dery show­ers per­sisted across the is­land yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The down­pour caused flash floods and scup­pered week­end plans, but the Na­tional En­vi­ron­ment Agency said some eas­ing is ex­pected to­day.</p>
    <p>Still, thun­dery show­ers are likely this af­ter­noon.</p>
    <p>Sweater weather con­tin­ued for the se­cond day of the new year in Sin­ga­pore, with wet and windy con­di­tions yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The Na­tional En­vi­ron­ment Agency (NEA) said on Face­book that wide­spread con­tin­u­ous rain, heavy at times and with thun­der, was ex­pected to con­tinue yes­ter­day and ease grad­u­ally in the night.</p>
    <p>It added later that while the rain was set to clear overnight, thun­dery show­ers are likely this af­ter­noon fol­low­ing a cloudy morning.</p>
    <p>The wet weather has been so per­sis­tent that the 318.6mm of rain that fell in Changi on Fri­day, the first day of this year, was more than the av­er­age of 238.3mm for the month of Jan­uary, said na­tional wa­ter agency PUB yes­ter­day on Face­book.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, the heav­i­est rain­fall of 210.6mm was also recorded in Changi be­tween mid­night and 7pm.</p>
    <p>Ear­lier yes­ter­day, when the fig­ure recorded in Changi had been 184.4mm, PUB said the amount was more than half of Sin­ga­pore’s av­er­age monthly rain­fall in Jan­uary and was within the top 1 per cent of max­i­mum daily rain­fall records for the past 39 years.</p>
    <p>The agency sent its of­fi­cers to help Sin­ga­pore­ans deal with the flood risk from the rain.</p>
    <p>“PUB’s quick re­sponse teams were de­ployed to di­rect traf­fic and ren­der as­sis­tance to res­i­dents in the (af­fected) ar­eas... to pro­tect them from flood risk,” it said.</p>
    <p>For ex­am­ple, of­fi­cers helped res­i­dents in Mount­bat­ten and Jalan Seav­iew to in­stall in­flat­able flood bags to pro­tect their homes.</p>
    <p>The low­est tem­per­a­ture recorded yes­ter­day, as at 7pm, was 21.1 deg C in New­ton, said NEA.</p>
    <p>This was lower than ini­tially fore­cast last Thurs­day by the Me­te­o­ro­log­i­cal Ser­vice Sin­ga­pore, which pre­dicted an av­er­age tem­per­a­ture of 23 deg C to 33 deg C over the first two weeks of this month, dip­ping to lows of 22 deg C on some days.</p>
    <p>For some peo­ple, the colder weather was a re­lief. In­vest­ment an­a­lyst Law Kai Tsi, 33, said it was “un­char­ac­ter­is­ti­cally chilly” in Novena.</p>
    <p>“Usu­ally we’re sweat­ing like pigs in a blan­ket, so it’s nice to oc­ca­sion­ally ex­pe­ri­ence tem­per­a­tures un­der 22 deg C... I’m go­ing to take the op­por­tu­nity to throw on a sweater and go out­side,” he said.</p>
    <p>Oth­ers had their week­end plans dis­rupted by the down­pour across the is­land, while the wet weather caused flood­ing in places.</p>
    <p>Chi­nese daily Lianhe Wan­bao said that on New Year’s Day, cars were stranded in flash floods in Lorong Halus in Pasir Ris.</p>
    <p>Separately, pho­tos and videos cir­cu­lat­ing on so­cial me­dia showed a fallen tree near Loyang Av­enue block­ing two lanes of traf­fic.</p>
    <p>As­so­ciate pro­fes­sor of science, tech­nol­ogy and so­ci­ety Win­ston Chow from the Sin­ga­pore Man­age­ment Univer­sity’s School of So­cial Sciences pro­jected that the record for the high­est to­tal rain­fall in one day for Jan­uary could be bro­ken yes­ter­day as well.</p>
    <p>“With the mon­soon surge not ex­pected to cease un­til Sun­day, chances are this record will be bro­ken with time to spare,” he said in a tweet yes­ter­day, re­fer­ring to to­day.</p>
    <p>The surge refers to a strength­en­ing of winds over the South China Sea, caus­ing ex­ten­sive rain clouds to form over the sur­round­ing re­gion.</p>
    <p>Prof Chow said mon­soon surges are typ­i­cal dur­ing this sea­son, and that South-east Asia be­ing in a La Nina phase now might mean more rain­fall than nor­mal.</p>
    <p>The La Nina climate phe­nom­e­non is brought about when trade winds in­ten­sify, caus­ing changes in at­mo­spheric pres­sure and sea sur­face tem­per­a­tures in the trop­i­cal Pa­cific Ocean. This con­cen­trates the mois­ture sup­ply around the mar­itime con­ti­nent, lead­ing to more rain clouds form­ing.</p>
    <p>The Straits Times pre­vi­ously re­ported that La Nina con­di­tions were de­tected here last Novem­ber. This means wet­ter con­di­tions could be­come more preva­lent not only this month, but also next month and March.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to an ad­vi­sory by the weath­er­man, the first week of this year is likely to be wet and windy, with mod­er­ate thun­dery show­ers ex­pected in the af­ter­noons on most days over the fort­night.</p>
    <p>NEA said this is the first surge in the cur­rent north-east mon­soon sea­son, usu­ally with two or three surges dur­ing the sea­son.</p>
    <p>Heavy and wide­spread thun­dery show­ers over the is­land will also occur on a cou­ple of days as well.</p>
    <p>Usu­ally we’re sweat­ing like pigs in a blan­ket, so it’s nice to oc­ca­sion­ally ex­pe­ri­ence tem­per­a­tures un­der 22 deg C... I’m go­ing to take the op­por­tu­nity to throw on a sweater and go out­side.</p>
    <p>MR LAW KAI TSI, an in­vest­ment an­a­lyst, who said it was “un­char­ac­ter­is­ti­cally chilly” in Novena.</p>
