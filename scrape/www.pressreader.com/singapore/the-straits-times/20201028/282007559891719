    <p>In 2009, Bri­tish au­thor Martin Jacques pub­lished a best­selling book, When China Rules The World. Mr Jacques is now run­ning a vic­tory lap. He re­cently pro­claimed that “we will re­mem­ber 2020 as the mo­ment of the Great Tran­si­tion. The year when China re­placed the US as the world’s lead­ing power”.</p>
    <p>Be­liev­ers in a “great tran­si­tion” see Covid-19 as the hand­maiden of his­tory.</p>
    <p>The coro­n­avirus pan­demic started in China. But the Chi­nese gov­ern­ment has done a much bet­ter job of con­tain­ing the dis­ease than the US.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to Johns Hop­kins Univer­sity, the to­tal num­ber of deaths in the United States from Covid-19 stood at over 223,000 at the end of last week com­pared with 4,379 in China.</p>
    <p>With the dis­ease con­tained, the Chi­nese econ­omy is re­bound­ing and looks set to grow by 2 per cent this year, mak­ing it the only</p>
    <p>Group of 20 econ­omy to ex­pand. By con­trast, the US econ­omy is likely to shrink by 3 per cent to 5 per cent and the ma­jor Euro­pean economies are in trou­ble.</p>
    <p>China’s abil­ity to en­force quar­an­tines and test widely is gen­er­ally seen as cru­cial to the coun­try’s suc­cess in tack­ling the virus. At a re­cent cer­e­mony to hand out medals to Chi­nese cit­i­zens for their work on Covid-19, Pres­i­dent Xi Jin­ping an­nounced that “the pan­demic once again proves the supremacy of the so­cial­ist sys­tem with Chi­nese char­ac­ter­is­tics”.</p>
    <p>While the Chi­nese elite is pat­ting it­self on the back, the US es­tab­lish­ment is aghast. The New Eng­land Jour­nal Of Medicine re­cently noted in an editorial that “our lead­ers have failed... They have taken a cri­sis and turned it into a tragedy”.</p>
    <p>This scathing crit­i­cism of the Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion has not, how­ever, led to the ar­rest of the ed­i­tors of the jour­nal.</p>
    <p>By con­trast, last month, Ren Zhiqiang, a prop­erty ty­coon, was sen­tenced to 18 years in prison in China. Ren’s fall from grace came af­ter he pub­lished an ag­gres­sive crit­i­cism of Mr Xi’s han­dling of the early stages of the pan­demic, call­ing the Chi­nese leader a “bare, naked clown”.</p>
    <p>Shortly af­ter­wards, Ren was stripped of his Com­mu­nist Party mem­ber­ship and charged with cor­rup­tion.</p>
    <p>Some of the doc­tors who first raised the alarm about Covid-19, in pri­vate ex­changes, in Wuhan, were no­to­ri­ously rep­ri­manded by the po­lice.</p>
    <p>Ex­ter­nal crit­ics of China’s han­dling of Covid-19 are also treated with fe­roc­ity. When the Aus­tralian gov­ern­ment sug­gested an in­ter­na­tional in­quiry into the pan­demic, Bei­jing re­sponded with trade sanc­tions.</p>
    <p>The in­abil­ity to ac­cept crit­i­cism sug­gests that pro-Bei­jing tri­umphal­ism is pre­ma­ture.</p>
    <p>In broad terms, there is not much doubt that China, af­ter mis­han­dling the ini­tial out­break, has done a good job of con­tain­ing the dis­ease. But some Asian democ­ra­cies, such as South Korea and Tai­wan, have done even bet­ter, which un­der­mines Mr Xi’s claim that China’s “so­cial­ist sys­tem” was the key to suc­cess.</p>
    <p>China’s urge to sup­press crit­i­cism also sug­gests that if there are con­tin­u­ing prob­lems in­side the coun­try, Bei­jing will cover them up.</p>
    <p>The pan­demic has also sig­nif­i­cantly eroded in­ter­na­tional good­will to­wards China.</p>
    <p>It may be re­garded as trai­tor­ous in China to high­light the ori­gins of the dis­ease – or to point out that the pre­vi­ous Sars epi­demic also orig­i­nated in China. But the out­side world has no­ticed. A re­cent Pew opin­ion sur­vey of 14 mainly Western na­tions showed 61 per cent thought China had done a bad job of han­dling Covid-19 and that dis­trust of Mr Xi has soared.</p>
    <p>The in­ter­na­tional back­lash com­pounds the chal­lenges to the “China model” al­ready cre­ated by Covid-19.</p>
    <p>For 40 years, Chi­nese eco­nomic growth has been pow­ered by trade. The coun­try is the world’s largest man­u­fac­turer and its largest ex­porter. But Covid-19 has seen a sharp re­duc­tion in world trad­ing vol­umes. This is hap­pen­ing at a time when Wash­ing­ton is ral­ly­ing in­ter­na­tional op­po­si­tion to Bei­jing and cur­tail­ing trade in sen­si­tive tech­nolo­gies.</p>
    <p>As a re­sult, the per­mis­sive in­ter­na­tional en­vi­ron­ment that pow­ered the Chi­nese eco­nomic mir­a­cle is dis­ap­pear­ing.</p>
    <p>China’s lead­er­ship is meet­ing this week to plan for the years ahead. But its abil­ity to openly de­bate th­ese prob­lems is ham­pered by the thought-sti­fling cult of personalit­y that has built up around Mr Xi.</p>
    <p>Since tak­ing power in 2012, the Chi­nese leader has purged many of his ri­vals, abol­ished con­sti­tu­tional term lim­its that would pre­vent him rul­ing for life, and forced the Com­mu­nist Party to in­cor­po­rate “Xi Jin­ping thought” into its Con­sti­tu­tion.</p>
    <p>This is no mere for­mal­ity. On the con­trary, gov­ern­ment of­fi­cials and even pri­vate com­pa­nies are un­der con­stant pres­sure to praise the great leader’s banal pro­nounce­ments. As a re­cent col­umn for Bloomberg News pointed out, even China’s weather fore­cast­ers and sci­ence fic­tion writ­ers have been of­fi­cially rep­ri­manded for not do­ing enough to in­cor­po­rate “Xi Jin­ping thought” into their work.</p>
    <p>Mr Xi ad­mires the leader cult that sur­rounded Mao Ze­dong. But blind obe­di­ence to Mao’s whims led China to disas­ter dur­ing his Cul­tural Revo­lu­tion. Leader cults rarely end well any­where – and there is lit­tle rea­son to be­lieve that China un­der Mr Xi will ul­ti­mately be any dif­fer­ent.</p>
    <p>The US sys­tem has had a ter­ri­ble few years and the Amer­i­can elite is rightly go­ing through a pe­riod of self-doubt and in­tro­spec­tion.</p>
    <p>But reg­u­lar elec­tions of­fer the pos­si­bil­ity to change course and ap­point new lead­ers. The US can get rid of Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump – and may be about to do so. China has no mech­a­nism to rid it­self of the in­creas­ingly mega­lo­ma­ni­a­cal Pres­i­dent Xi.</p>
