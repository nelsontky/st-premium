    <p>Thai pro­test­ers ral­lied in Bangkok yes­ter­day evening to con­demn a con­sti­tu­tional court de­ci­sion to clear Prime Min­is­ter Prayut Chano-cha of wrong­do­ing for stay­ing in army hous­ing be­yond his re­tire­ment as army chief.</p>
    <p>Chant­ing “get out” and “evil prime min­is­ter”, they al­leged that Mr Prayut got pref­er­en­tial treat­ment. They also re­peated their months-long de­mand that King Maha Va­ji­ra­longkorn stay above politics as would be ex­pected in con­sti­tu­tional monar­chies.</p>
    <p>Ear­lier yes­ter­day, the Con­sti­tu­tional Court said Mr Prayut was en­ti­tled to stay at the guest quar­ters in the First In­fantry Reg­i­ment base in Bangkok, where he had been liv­ing be­fore his re­tire­ment from the mil­i­tary.</p>
    <p>“Gen­eral Prayut Chan-o-cha can le­git­i­mately stay i n the army guests fa­cil­ity... as a for­mer army leader and as a per­son who serves the coun­try,” the court said.</p>
    <p>If the court had ruled oth­er­wise, he could have been thrown out of power.</p>
    <p>In May 2014, the then army chief staged a coup that top­pled the Pheu Thai Party-led gov­ern­ment and in­stalled him­self as prime min­is­ter.</p>
    <p>He re­tired from his mil­i­tary post in Septem­ber that year, but con­tin­ued to stay in the army quar­ters with his fam­ily.</p>
    <p>Af­ter last year’s elec­tion, he re­turned as premier head­ing the present coali­tion gov­ern­ment.</p>
    <p>Op­po­si­tion law­mak­ers filed a com­plaint about his al­leged abuse of power ear­lier this year.</p>
    <p>Mr Prayut, 66, has said he is stay­ing in the bar­racks for se­cu­rity rea­sons. He did not ap­pear in court yes­ter­day, choos­ing to make a field visit to Sa­mut Songkhram prov­ince and then at­tend a meet­ing at the Gov­ern­ment House.</p>
    <p>Since Fe­bru­ary, youth-led protests have taken hold against the gov­ern­ment, which demon­stra­tors ar­gue is a holdover from Mr Prayut’s ear­lier regime that tri­umphed by dint of a spe­cially</p>
    <p>en­gi­neered Con­sti­tu­tion.</p>
    <p>Apart from de­mand­ing that the Con­sti­tu­tion be amended and Mr Prayut re­sign, pro­test­ers have also called for the monar­chy to be re­formed.</p>
    <p>The last de­mand is the most con­tro­ver­sial, given that King Vaji</p>
    <p>ra­longkorn con­trols two army units and per­son­ally owns as­sets es­ti­mated at over US$40 bil­lion (S$53.6 bil­lion) that used to be held in the name of the Crown Prop­erty Bureau.</p>
    <p>While law­mak­ers voted last month to be­gin the process of amend­ing the Char­ter, most have been re­luc­tant to touch the pow­ers of the monar­chy.</p>
    <p>The King, who usu­ally spends much of the year in Ger­many, has been tour­ing Thai­land with Queen Suthida, and meet­ing and prais­ing roy­al­ists close-up.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, the gov­ern­ment has lifted a mora­to­rium on lese ma­jeste charges, which were brought by po­lice against at least 12 protest l ead­ers over the past week.</p>
    <p>Un­der this l aw, any­one con­victed of in­sult­ing or de­fam­ing the King, Queen or heir ap­par­ent can be jailed for up to 15 years.</p>
    <p>The es­ca­lated po­lice ac­tion did not de­ter pro­test­ers from ral­ly­ing out­side an army base hous­ing a unit per­son­ally con­trolled by the King on Sun­day.</p>
    <p>At yes­ter­day’s rally, key protest leader Arnon Nampa, who has been charged un­der the lese ma­jeste law, again took aim at the King.</p>
    <p>“Many is­sues will arise if the monar­chy is not po­lit­i­cally neu­tral,” he said on a stage de­signed to look like a court. He promised that the protests will con­tinue into next year and the move­ment will grow.</p>
