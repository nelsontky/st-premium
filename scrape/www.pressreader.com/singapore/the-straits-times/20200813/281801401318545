    <p>GENEVA • Young peo­ple are be­ing hit espe­cially hard by the coro­n­avirus cri­sis as their jobs dry up and ed­u­ca­tion is dis­rupted, ac­cord­ing to the In­ter­na­tional Labour Or­gan­i­sa­tion (ILO).</p>
    <p>The un­der-30s of­ten work i n sec­tors suf­fer­ing the most from the pan­demic, mak­ing them par­tic­u­larly vul­ner­a­ble. While that is a fa­mil­iar trait of eco­nomic crises, the cur­rent sit­u­a­tion also raises con­cerns about long-term scar­ring be­cause of huge dis­rup­tions in train­ing, the Geneva-based or­gan­i­sa­tion said in a re­port based on a global poll.</p>
    <p>“How this will even­tu­ally im­pact the young peo­ple who will come to the labour mar­ket next year or in two years’ time, that is a re­ally big ques­tion,” said Mr Sangheon Lee, di­rec­tor of the ILO’s Em­ploy­ment Pol­icy De­part­ment. Both prob­lems to­gether mean “this dis­pro­por­tion­ate im­pact we al­ready start to see will con­tinue in the years to come”.</p>
    <p>The is­sue is one of a host of chal­lenges for pol­i­cy­mak­ers as they try to drag their economies out of the deep­est slump in liv­ing mem­ory. It also shows how the cri­sis ag­gra­vates prob­lems with in­equal­ity, both within in­di­vid­ual so­ci­eties and be­tween richer and poorer coun­tries.</p>
    <p>Mil­len­ni­als were al­ready hit by the fi­nan­cial cri­sis more than a decade ago, leav­ing them with in­se­cure work and stunted op­por­tu­ni­ties. They also faced a range of chal­lenges at the on­set of the pan­demic, in­clud­ing a slug­gish econ­omy and the rise of au­toma­tion, the ILO said in March.</p>
    <p>A lack of va­can­cies is ex­pected to lead to a longer tran­si­tion from school to work, ac­cord­ing to the ILO. Younger work­ers and those in lower-in­come na­tions are also more likely to see their work re­duced.</p>
    <p>The move from cam­puses to on­line learn­ing did not go smoothly ev­ery­where, re­veal­ing deep dig­i­tal di­vides, espe­cially in lower-in­come coun­tries, ac­cord­ing to the ILO. Nearly one in six of those polled said their ed­u­ca­tion had come to a com­plete stop, and more than half ex­pected their stud­ies to be de­layed.</p>
    <p>The sur­vey, which was con­ducted among 12,000 peo­ple in April and May, also sought to gauge the im­pact of the cri­sis on the men­tal health of young peo­ple.</p>
    <p>One in two are “pos­si­bly” sub­ject to anx­i­ety or de­pres­sion, with a fur­ther 17 per cent “prob­a­bly” im­pacted – po­ten­tially de­lay­ing the re­cov­ery in ed­u­ca­tion and em­ploy­ment.</p>
    <p>The sur­vey also found the youth to be largely com­pli­ant with stayat-home mea­sures, while one in four re­ported be­ing highly en­gaged in vol­un­teer­ing or mak­ing do­na­tions to the Covid-19 re­sponse.</p>
    <p>Euro­pean Cen­tral Bank pres­i­dent Chris­tine La­garde yes­ter­day urged con­tri­bu­tions from young peo­ple to the in­sti­tu­tion’s strat­egy re­view, call­ing them a “key mo­tor of change”, in a tweet.</p>
    <p>The ILO called for “ur­gent, largescale and tar­geted pol­icy re­sponses” to rein­te­grate those who lost their jobs in the labour mar­ket.</p>
