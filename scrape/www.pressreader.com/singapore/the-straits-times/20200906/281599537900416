    <p>DIS­TRICT JUDGE OLIVIA LOW’S FIND­ING ON THE LIEWS’ CRED­I­BIL­ITY</p>
    <p>I find that the judge’s even­tual find­ing that the pros­e­cu­tion’s wit­nesses (which in­clude Karl Liew) were largely cred­i­ble with clear, com­pelling and con­sis­tent ev­i­dence, is sim­ply un­jus­ti­fied and is, in my judg­ment, against the weight of the ev­i­dence.</p>
    <p>Karl’s dis­hon­esty on the stand was plainly ev­i­dent from his tes­ti­mony and the judge failed to fully ap­pre­ci­ate her de­ci­sion to amend the sec­ond charge in re­la­tion to Karl’s lack of cred­i­bil­ity.</p>
    <p>The fact that Karl lied about par­tic­u­lar items in the sec­ond amended charge does not only taint his cred­i­bil­ity as a wit­ness, but also af­fects the con­vic­tions for the items in the sec­ond charge that are premised on Karl’s tes­ti­mony alone.</p>
    <p>AN ‘IN­COM­PLETE DEMON­STRA­TION’ AT TRIAL</p>
    <p>On ap­peal, the pros­e­cu­tion con­ceded and agreed with the de­fence that dur­ing the trial below, there were al­ready dif­fi­cul­ties with the func­tion­al­ity of the Pi­o­neer DVD player in play­ing the</p>
    <p>DVD disc, but not in play­ing the recorded clip in the hard drive of the DVD player.</p>
    <p>The fact that there were such dif­fi­cul­ties with the func­tion­al­ity of the Pi­o­neer DVD player was, how­ever, nei­ther dis­closed to the ac­cused prior to the cross-ex­am­i­na­tion of Parti on the work­ing con­di­tion of the Pi­o­neer DVD player nor to the judge in the trial below.</p>
    <p>If the pros­e­cu­tion had known of this de­fect in the Pi­o­neer DVD player dur­ing the trial below, it should have fully dis­closed it.</p>
    <p>The trial court could be mis­led into think­ing that the Pi­o­neer DVD player was in a good work­ing con­di­tion when ques­tions were (and un­fairly) put to Parti on the ba­sis that the DVD player was still in a good work­ing con­di­tion af­ter an in­com­plete demon­stra­tion of its im­por­tant func­tion­al­i­ties dur­ing the trial.</p>
    <p>DED­I­CA­TION OF DE­FENCE LAWYER ANIL BALCHANDAN­I</p>
    <p>His writ­ten sub­mis­sions were de­tailed and well-foot­noted; his ar­gu­ments were per­sua­sive; he ex­plored care­fully ev­ery as­pect of the pros­e­cu­tion’s case and scru­ti­nised the vo­lu­mi­nous ev­i­dence in the tran­scripts in or­der to mount his client’s de­fence both at the trial and the ap­peal with clar­ity; he an­a­lysed the grounds of de­ci­sion of the trial judge in great de­tail to sub­mit on ar­eas where the trial judge had erred in her find­ings; he han­dled all these mat­ters sin­gle-hand­edly and had shown much ded­i­ca­tion in his pro bono work for this case.</p>
