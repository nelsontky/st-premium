    <p>Prime Min­is­ter Lee Hsien Loong yes­ter­day paid trib­ute to for­mer top civil ser­vant Ngiam Tong Dow. PM Lee said that Mr Ngiam stood out for his in­tel­lect and em­pa­thy, as well as his will­ing­ness to speak his mind. Mr Ngiam, 83, died on Thurs­day morn­ing.</p>
    <p>Prime Min­is­ter Lee Hsien Loong yes­ter­day paid trib­ute to for­mer top civil ser­vant Ngiam Tong Dow, whom he said stood out for his in­tel­lect and em­pa­thy, as well as his will­ing­ness to speak his mind. Mr Ngiam, 83, died on Thurs­day. In a con­do­lence let­ter ad­dressed to Mr Ngiam’s wife Jeanette, Mr Lee called him a “ver­sa­tile and out­stand­ing civil ser­vant” from the found­ing gen­er­a­tion.</p>
    <p>Mr Ngiam had spent 40 years in the apex Sin­ga­pore Ad­min­is­tra­tive Ser­vice where at 33, he be­came the youngest per­ma­nent sec­re­tary.</p>
    <p>“Tong Dow also served on some of our most im­por­tant statu­tory boards,” said Mr Lee, re­count­ing how Mr Ngiam joined the Eco­nomic De­vel­op­ment Board (EDB) in its ear­li­est days and helped set Sin­ga­pore on the path of in­dus­tri­al­i­sa­tion. “He worked tire­lessly to woo in­vestors and make Sin­ga­pore more busi­ness-friendly.”</p>
    <p>And as EDB chair­man from 1975 to 1981, he helped Sin­ga­pore move up the value chain into cap­i­tal-in­ten­sive in­dus­tries, and se­cure the coun­try’s role as a re­gional busi­ness hub. “He also fos­tered a go-get­ting cul­ture in EDB of­fi­cers that per­sists even to­day,” Mr Lee said.</p>
    <p>Mr Ngiam was the per­ma­nent sec­re­tary at the Min­istry of Trade and In­dus­try (MTI) when Mr Lee joined as Min­is­ter of State in 1984.</p>
    <p>“As a young of­fice holder, I ben­e­fited greatly from his con­sid­er­able ex­pe­ri­ence and sage ad­vice.”</p>
    <p>Mr Ngiam was on the eco­nomic com­mit­tee Mr Lee chaired in 1985 that came up with rec­om­men­da­tions to help Sin­ga­pore re­cover from its first post-in­de­pen­dence re­ces­sion – one partly caused by a high-wage pol­icy from the l ate 1970s which, to­gether with an over­val­ued cur­rency, chipped away at Sin­ga­pore’s com­pet­i­tive­ness.</p>
    <p>“He worked closely with me to im­ple­ment the rec­om­men­da­tions and help our com­pa­nies re­gain their com­pet­i­tive­ness and re­cover,” added Mr Lee.</p>
    <p>Many of the schemes in­tro­duced while he was the Hous­ing Board’s chair­man “stood the test of time and are still con­tin­u­ing to­day”, the PM noted, cit­ing the Build-To-Or­der sys­tem and lift up­grad­ing pro­gramme.</p>
    <p>An­other of his lega­cies is to be found in DBS Bank where he was chair­man for eight years. He re­struc­tured it to sharpen its fo­cus and ex­pand into the re­gion.</p>
    <p>“His ethos of dis­ci­pline and pru­dence con­tin­ues to de­fine the bank to­day,” Mr Lee said.</p>
    <p>“His legacy will live on, and his con­tri­bu­tions will touch the lives of many gen­er­a­tions of Sin­ga­pore­ans to come,” he added.</p>
    <p>Trib­utes also poured i n from Emer­i­tus Se­nior Min­is­ter Goh Chok Tong, friends and for­mer col­leagues.</p>
    <p>ESM Goh, in a Face­book post on Thurs­day, de­scribed Mr Ngiam as Sin­ga­pore’s eco­nomic czar. “When I was Prime Min­is­ter, I in­vited him for lunch oc­ca­sion­ally as I found it worth­while to lis­ten to his views on Sin­ga­pore’s econ­omy,” he said.</p>
    <p>Trade and In­dus­try Min­is­ter Chan Chun Sing noted on Face­book that as the min­istry’s first per­ma­nent sec­re­tary, Mr Ngiam was in­stru­men­tal in shap­ing and im­ple­ment­ing eco­nomic poli­cies that catal­ysed Sin­ga­pore’s trans­for­ma­tion from Third World to First.</p>
    <p>Mr Chan added: “We will con­tinue to up­hold his spirit of in­no­va­tion and re­silience as we chart our new path for­ward to­gether.”</p>
    <p>Pres­i­dent Hal­imah Ya­cob, in her con­do­lence let­ter to Mrs Ngiam, said his con­tri­bu­tions con­tinue to have an en­dur­ing im­pact on the lives of Sin­ga­pore­ans.</p>
    <p>The Pres­i­dent cited his key role in the birth of the MRT sys­tem, which he helped push to be set up de­spite strong op­po­si­tion from some quar­ters in the Govern­ment. Mr Ngiam was per­ma­nent sec­re­tary of the then-Min­istry of Com­mu­ni­ca­tions.</p>
    <p>“He was also a strong ad­vo­cate for our lo­cal en­ter­prises, which paved the way for the vi­brant small and medium-sized en­ter­prise land­scape we see to­day in Sin­ga­pore.”</p>
    <p>Mr Ngiam was out­spo­ken on is­sues such as the high con­cen­tra­tion of schol­ar­ship hold­ers in the civil ser­vice, and high min­is­te­rial pay.</p>
    <p>Vet­eran diplo­mat Tommy Koh, a close friend who stud­ied with him at Har­vard Uni­ver­sity i n 1963, called him a “lov­ing critic of Sin­ga­pore”.</p>
    <p>He was also ex­tremely thrifty, re­called Pro­fes­sor Koh.</p>
    <p>“When he was the per­ma­nent sec­re­tary of the Min­istry of Fi­nance, I went to beg for more fund­ing for the Sin­ga­pore Sym­phony Orches­tra.</p>
    <p>“He said ‘no’, un­til I re­minded him that it was es­tab­lished by his men­tor, Dr Goh Keng Swee, and there is no lead­ing city of the world with­out a res­i­dent orches­tra.”</p>
    <p>Mr Ngiam is sur­vived by his wife Jeanette Gan Choon Neo, daugh­ter Selina, son Kelvin, and three grand­chil­dren.</p>
    <p>To­day, the wake at 4 Ch­est­nut Av­enue is be­tween noon and 10pm, with a prayer ser­vice at 8pm. To­mor­row, the cortege will leave for Mandai Cre­ma­to­rium for a pri­vate ser­vice.</p>
