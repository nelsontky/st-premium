    <p>Af­ter Madam Ng Yuet Hay was di­ag­nosed with ter­mi­nal can­cer in July, her son Chia Fu Yong rushed to ful­fil her long-cher­ished wish to see him tie the knot. He and girl­friend Tan Mei Xuan planned their wed­ding in two months, and they were one of 876 cou­ples who said their vows on Oct 10, the most pop­u­lar wed­ding date this year.</p>
    <p>Af­ter Madam Ng Yuet Hay, 71, was di­ag­nosed with ter­mi­nal can­cer in July, her son Chia Fu Yong, 35, rushed to ful­fil her long-cher­ished wish to see him tie the knot.</p>
    <p>Mr Chia said: “I was afraid she wouldn’t be able to see me wed. It’s very hard to say how long she has left.”</p>
    <p>He and his girl­friend of four years, Ms Tan Mei Xuan, 28, planned their wed­ding in two months.</p>
    <p>They were one of 876 cou­ples who said their vows last Satur­day – Oct 10, the most pop­u­lar wed­ding date this year.</p>
    <p>Along the way, the cou­ple had help from Am­bu­lance Wish Sin­ga­pore, a char­ity that ful­fils the last wishes of ter­mi­nally ill pa­tients.</p>
    <p>The char­ity sent Madam Ng, who is now bedrid­den and liv­ing at home, to the solem­ni­sa­tion cer­e­mony in an am­bu­lance.</p>
    <p>A nurse from Dover Park Hos­pice, which pro­vides pal­lia­tive care to Madam Ng at home, alerted the char­ity of her wish.</p>
    <p>His eyes brim­ming with tears, Mr Chia said: “I saw my mum smile dur­ing the solem­ni­sa­tion and I could see she was very happy.</p>
    <p>“I’m very happy I ful­filled her wish.”</p>
    <p>Mr Chia, a pro­gramme man­ager, had pro­posed to Ms Tan, who runs an ice cream shop, at the start of the year. They had not set a wed­ding date, but he had next year in mind.</p>
    <p>Ten­ta­tive plans were fast­tracked when his mother, who used to work as an ad­min­is­tra­tive as­sis­tant, was di­ag­nosed with stage four pan­cre­atic can­cer.</p>
    <p>Mr Chia, the el­dest of three chil­dren, said: “The di­ag­no­sis came as a shock. The doc­tor said she prob­a­bly has about one year left to live.”</p>
    <p>So, the cou­ple, who met while vol­un­teer­ing, de­cided to wed on Oct 10, as it was an aus­pi­cious date both sets of par­ents liked and the “10/10” date sounded nice, said Mr Chia.</p>
    <p>But two weeks be­fore the big day, Madam Ng’s con­di­tion be­gan to de­te­ri­o­rate steadily and the fam­ily feared she would not live to wit­ness her son’s nup­tials.</p>
    <p>But she pulled through.</p>
    <p>Mr Chia said: “I felt she hung on for my wed­ding.”</p>
    <p>The mar­riage solem­ni­sa­tion was con­ducted at Ma­rina One and the wed­ding din­ner was held at a restau­rant in the same build­ing.</p>
    <p>Madam Ng at­tended the cer­e­mony while ly­ing on a stretcher, ac­com­pa­nied by a nurse ar­ranged by Am­bu­lance Wish.</p>
    <p>She can­not sit up for more than 10 min­utes with­out ex­pe­ri­enc­ing pain.</p>
    <p>Dr Ong Yew Jin, chair­man of Am­bu­lance Wish Sin­ga­pore, said: “Madam Ng could barely speak, but she man­aged to whis­per to the nurse and our vol­un­teer that she was very happy.</p>
    <p>“She was mostly quiet through­out, so see­ing her break into a smile as she shared how happy she was was a mem­o­rable mo­ment for us.”</p>
    <p>Mr Chia said his fam­ily, in­clud­ing his 77-year-old fa­ther, is grate­ful to Am­bu­lance Wish for help­ing to ful­fil his mother’s dy­ing wish.</p>
    <p>“Am­bu­lance Wish put in the ef­fort to get to know my mum and to make her com­fort­able. It’s re­ally very nice of them to do so.”</p>
    <p>He said he trea­sures his re­main­ing time with his mother, al­though he is strug­gling with the grief of even­tu­ally los­ing her.</p>
    <p>He said: “Now that mum is go­ing, I won­der: Have I spent enough time with her or done enough for her? I feel like I miss my mum al­ready.”</p>
    <p>FIGHT­ING TO STAY FOR WED­DING</p>
    <p>I felt she hung on for my wed­ding.</p>
    <p>MR CHIA FU YONG, whose mother’s con­di­tion be­gan to de­te­ri­o­rate steadily two weeks be­fore the big day.</p>
