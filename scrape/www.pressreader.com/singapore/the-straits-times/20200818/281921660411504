    <p>KUALA LUMPUR • A 19-year-old teenager has been found guilty of mur­der at the Malaysian High Court over the death of 21 stu­dents and two teach­ers in a fire at an Is­lamic school in Kuala Lumpur al­most three years ago, The Star news site re­ported yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The deaths of the teenage stu­dents at Pusat Tah­fiz Darul Qu­ran It­ti­faqiyah along with two of their teach­ers when the build­ing was pur­posely set on fire shook Malaysia as it was one of the big­gest mass killings in the coun­try.</p>
    <p>The incident oc­curred be­tween 4.15am and 6.45am on Sept 14, 2017, in Kam­pung Datuk Kera­mat, about 5km from the Petronas Twin Tow­ers.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to the amended charge, the teenager, to­gether with an­other unidentifi­ed in­di­vid­ual, mur­dered 23 peo­ple at the school. But an­other male teen was ac­quit­ted of the same mur­der charges in Jan­uary.</p>
    <p>In his de­ci­sion, Justice Az­man Ab­dul­lah said the ac­cused, who was 16 years old at the time of the of­fence, failed to raise rea­son­able doubt in his de­fence. “The pros­e­cu­tion had proven their case be­yond rea­son­able doubt,” The Star re­ported him say­ing yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Due to the ac­cused’s age, the court or­dered that he be de­tained in a prison at the plea­sure of the Malaysian King i n ac­cor­dance with Sec­tion 97(1) of the Child Act 2001. It is up to the King to de­ter­mine the terms and con­di­tion of the teenager’s de­ten­tion from time to time, the judge said.</p>
    <p>Un­der nor­mal cir­cum­stances, con­vic­tions un­der Sec­tion 302 of the Pe­nal Code carry a manda­tory death sen­tence.</p>
    <p>“I pray for those de­ceased to be granted heaven,” Justice Az­man said.</p>
