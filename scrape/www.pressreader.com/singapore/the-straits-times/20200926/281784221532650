    <p>A new ap­proach to quar­an­tine has been adopted for mi­grant worker dor­mi­to­ries aimed at re­duc­ing the num­ber of res­i­dents that need to be iso­lated – min­imis­ing dis­rup­tion to work and im­prov­ing worker wel­fare.</p>
    <p>Pre­vi­ously, the en­tire block had to be quar­an­tined for 14 days when a dorm res­i­dent tested pos­i­tive for Covid-19, mi­nus those who had re­cov­ered re­cently.</p>
    <p>Now, only smaller groups, such as those liv­ing on the same floor or in the same sec­tion, will need to do so, the Min­istry of Man­power (MOM) said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>This ap­plies for dorms that have no in­ter­mix­ing be­tween work­ers, with seg­re­ga­tion mea­sures put in place by dorm op­er­a­tors, and where other Covid-19 re­stric­tions are ob­served, added MOM.</p>
    <p>An­other up­dated cri­te­rion is ex­cus­ing those who have re­cov­ered and are within 150 days of their in­fec­tion from hav­ing to be quar­an­tined. Pre­vi­ously, those who had passed their 120th day of in­fec­tion had to serve quar­an­tine.</p>
    <p>“This is in view of the lat­est med­i­cal ev­i­dence which showed that th­ese work­ers con­tinue to have an­ti­bod­ies to guard against re-in­fec­tion,” MOM said in a state­ment.</p>
    <p>Giv­ing an ex­am­ple of how the num­ber of work­ers who need to be quar­an­tined would be re­duced, MOM said all 318 work­ers in one of the two blocks of Westlite Wood­lands dor­mi­tory would have had to be quar­an­tined un­der its pre­vi­ous strat­egy, af­ter a new in­fec­tion was re­ported on Sept 12 af­ter rou­tine test­ing.</p>
    <p>How­ever, only 68 work­ers were quar­an­tined un­der the new “dif­fer­en­ti­ated and tar­geted” ap­proach adopted by the MOM’s re­cently formed As­sur­ance, Care and En­gage­ment (Ace) Group that is man</p>
    <p>aging the Covid-19 sit­u­a­tion in for­eign worker dorms.</p>
    <p>Hav­ing this smaller quar­an­tine group was pos­si­ble as proper safe liv­ing mea­sures were in place to en­sure seg­re­ga­tion, such that the re­main­ing six lev­els were not af­fected, added the min­istry.</p>
    <p>One of the two blocks in Westlite Wood­lands with 13 storeys is seg­re­gated by floors. Mea­sures in the dorm, which cur­rently houses about 2,100 work­ers, to pre­vent in­ter­min­gling be­tween sec­tions in­clude in­stalling net­ting and plas­tic sheets in door­ways, putting up bar­ri­cades, and hav­ing ded­i­cated lifts,</p>
    <p>stair­cases, en­trances and ex­its for each sec­tion.</p>
    <p>Since all dorms were de­clared clear of Covid-19 on Aug 11, 232 new cases have been de­tected through ros­tered rou­tine test­ing, said MOM.</p>
    <p>Other work­ers in the af­fected dorms were ringfenced, tested and iso­lated to pre­vent fur­ther spread.</p>
    <p>MOM said this strat­egy has been suc­cess­ful in curb­ing fur­ther out­breaks, for in­stance, when new in­fec­tions were dis­cov­ered in Tampines Dor­mi­tory on Aug 23 and Sept 7 through rou­tine test­ing.</p>
    <p>The min­istry said the new ap­proach was adopted af­ter a re­view</p>
    <p>of the out­comes fol­low­ing the im­po­si­tion of quar­an­tine in var­i­ous dorms. “We have also taken into ac­count that many dor­mi­to­ries have since im­ple­mented tighter safe liv­ing mea­sures to limit in­ter­mix­ing be­tween res­i­dents.”</p>
    <p>Mr Man­preet Singh Sidhu, who is an Ace Group deputy team leader, said: “Fewer work­ers quar­an­tined means hav­ing to do fewer tests. At the same time, em­ploy­ers’ op­er­a­tions are not as af­fected.”</p>
    <p>He added that the group of dorm res­i­dents who has to be quar­an­tined would de­pend on how each dorm is struc­tured and seg­re­gated.</p>
    <p>Mr Kong Chee Min, chief ex­ec­u­tive of Cen­tu­rion Cor­po­ra­tion which runs five dorms in Sin­ga­pore, said that when an en­tire block is quar­an­tined, a lot of work is cre­ated for the op­er­a­tors. Other than pro­vid­ing food and other es­sen­tials, there is also ad­min­is­tra­tive work in­volved, and em­ploy­ers would need to be in­formed.</p>
    <p>He added: “When the work­ers are quar­an­tined, es­pe­cially for con­sec­u­tive pe­ri­ods, they do get anx­ious... I be­lieve hav­ing this more tar­geted ap­proach will ben­e­fit them.”</p>
