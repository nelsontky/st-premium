    <p>WASH­ING­TON • The United States House of Rep­re­sen­ta­tives has voted to force com­pa­nies to dis­close prod­ucts that come from China’s Xin­jiang re­gion, in a new bid to stop what law­mak­ers say is wide­spread forced labour in the restive area.</p>
    <p>The Bill fol­lows a broader Act ap­proved a week ear­lier that aims to ban im­ports from Xin­jiang, con­tend­ing that abuses of the Uighur peo­ple are so wide­spread that all goods from the re­gion should be con­sid­ered made with slave labour.</p>
    <p>“The ex­ploita­tion and en­slave­ment of the Uighurs must stop. Amer­i­cans don’t want to pur­chase goods made with slave labour,” said Rep­re­sen­ta­tive Jen­nifer Wex­ton, a Demo­crat who led the lat­est ef­fort.</p>
    <p>The leg­is­la­tion would re­quire all pub­licly traded com­pa­nies to re­port to the Se­cu­ri­ties and Ex­change Com­mis­sion whether they are in­volved in Xin­jiang, a ma­jor source of the global tex­tile in­dus­try’s yarn.</p>
    <p>Un­like the broader Act, which passed al­most unan­i­mously, the Uighur Forced Labour Dis­clo­sure Act drew op­po­si­tion from most Repub­li­cans on Wed­nes­day, but passed by 253-163 in the Demo­cratic-led House.</p>
    <p>Its prospects are un­cer­tain as it needs to clear the Se­nate, which is con­trolled by Repub­li­cans and con­sumed by dis­cus­sions on a Supreme Court nom­i­na­tion and Covid-19 relief a month be­fore elec­tions.</p>
    <p>Repub­li­cans raised ob­jec­tions af­ter concerns voiced by the US Cham­ber of Com­merce, which said that the reg­u­la­tions im­posed an im­pos­si­ble bur­den on le­git­i­mate firms.</p>
    <p>The busi­ness lobby drew a par­al­lel with pre­vi­ous ef­forts to la­bel min­er­als from con­flict-torn Demo­cratic Repub­lic of Congo, say­ing that com­pa­nies had no re­li­able way to cer­tify if their prod­ucts are free from abuses.</p>
    <p>Rep­re­sen­ta­tive Pa­trick McHenry, a Re­pub­li­can, ac­cused Bill spon­sor Wex­ton of want­ing to ap­pear tough on China and said a bet­ter ap­proach was to im­pose sanc­tions on of­fi­cials, as Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump’s ad­min­is­tra­tion has done.</p>
    <p>“The Bill be­fore us is noth­ing more than a press re­lease for an elec­tion,” he said.</p>
    <p>Ms Wex­ton, whose district in North­ern Vir­ginia has a large Uighur Amer­i­can com­mu­nity, scoffed at the sug­ges­tion and said Repub­li­cans were ig­nor­ing abuses and “per­haps even geno­cide” in Xin­jiang.</p>
    <p>“Repub­li­cans talk a good game but only if it doesn’t cre­ate any kind of bur­den on US cor­po­ra­tions or their profit mar­gins,” she said.</p>
    <p>The Aus­tralian Strate­gic Pol­icy In­sti­tute in a re­cent re­port said it had iden­ti­fied more than 380 sus­pected de­ten­tion fa­cil­i­ties where China is be­lieved to have held more than one mil­lion Uighurs and other mostly Mus­lim Tur­kic­s­peak­ing peo­ple.</p>
