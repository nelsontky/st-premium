    <p>LON­DON • The con­tro­ver­sial pro­posed shake-up for English foot­ball has been re­jected by Premier League clubs fol­low­ing an emer­gency meet­ing yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>All 20 clubs de­bated rad­i­cal plans to re­struc­ture English foot­ball at a share­hold­ers’ meet­ing as Bri­tish Cul­ture Sec­re­tary Oliver Dow­den ac­knowl­edged the pro­pos­als as “Project Power Grab”.</p>
    <p>The “Project Big Pic­ture” plan, backed by Liver­pool and Manch­ester United and cham­pi­oned by English Foot­ball League (EFL) chair­man Rick Parry, has also been crit­i­cised by the gov­ern­ment, Foot­ball As­so­ci­a­tion (FA), Premier League and fan groups.</p>
    <p>Un­der the pro­pos­als, the num­ber of teams in the English top flight would be cut from 20 to 18, while the League Cup and the Com­mu­nity Shield would be scrapped.</p>
    <p>There would also be changes to vot­ing rights and a sub­stan­tial fi­nan­cial settlement for the strug­gling EFL due to the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>While there was much praise for some of the fi­nan­cial pro­pos­als – in­clud­ing a £250 mil­lion (S$442 mil­lion) bailout of the EFL plus an an­nual 25 per cent of rev­enue pay­ment to the lower leagues – many of the re­forms were con­sid­ered noth­ing more than a “power grab”.</p>
    <p>Un­der Project Big Pic­ture, nine clubs – the “Big Six” of Liver­pool, United, Manch­ester City, Arse­nal, Chelsea and Tot­ten­ham and the three long­est-serv­ing teams – would have all vot­ing power which in­cludes the abil­ity to veto takeovers of ri­val clubs.</p>
    <p>Fol­low­ing the vir­tual meet­ing yes­ter­day, the 20 clubs swiftly re­jected the plan and have also agreed to com­mis­sion a strat­egy re­view and a new bailout of­fer to the EFL.</p>
    <p>An EPL state­ment read: “Premier League share­hold­ers to­day unan­i­mously agreed to work to­gether as a 20-club col­lec­tive on a strate­gic plan for the fu­ture struc­tures and fi­nanc­ing of English foot­ball. Premier League clubs also agreed that Project Big Pic­ture will not be en­dorsed by the Premier League, any of its clubs or The FA.”</p>
    <p>Mr Dow­den, speak­ing to Par­lia­ment’s dig­i­tal, cul­ture, me­dia and sport com­mit­tee, said the pro­pos­als “tended to­wards a closed shop” in favour of the Big Six.</p>
    <p>Asked for his view on Parry specif­i­cally, he said: “I would have pre­ferred that at the end of this, that rather than read­ing about this Project Power Grab as you rightly put it, in­stead I was read­ing how they had come to a deal to se­cure the fu­ture of foot­ball.”</p>
    <p>His com­ments come af­ter FA chair­man Greg Clarke said a break­away from the top flight was wielded “as a threat” dur­ing talks over the di­vi­sive plans.</p>
    <p>In a let­ter to the FA coun­cil, which con­venes to­day, he said he had taken part in ini­tial dis­cus­sions be­fore walk­ing away when he felt the aim had be­come “the con­cen­tra­tion of power and wealth in the hands of a few clubs, with a break­away league mooted as a threat”.</p>
    <p>Clarke also warned that the FA could use its so-called “golden share” as a trump card if it felt the wider in­ter­ests of the game were be­ing com­pro­mised, and sug­gested that any break­away com­pe­ti­tion would not re­ceive the nec­es­sary sanc­tions from the gov­ern­ing body.</p>
    <p>Fans of the Big Six have op­posed the Project Big Pic­ture idea as well. Ac­cord­ing to goal.com, a state­ment re­leased on Tues­day on be­half of sup­porter groups from all six clubs said fans were “to­tally op­posed” to the idea of a de­par­ture from the “one club, one vote” ethos of the Premier League, and to “con­cen­trat­ing power in the hands of six bil­lion­aire own­ers”.</p>
    <p>Former FA chair­man David Bern­stein is ex­pected to call for in­de­pen­dent reg­u­la­tion to­day with a dif­fer­ent pro­posal – pro­duced over six months with a small group of peo­ple in­de­pen­dent of the FA.</p>
    <p>The Guardian re­ported Bern­stein’s group be­lieves that the sport can­not be trusted to re­form it­self and there­fore re­quires in­de­pen­dent ideas and body to cater to the dif­fer­ent needs of the FA, Premier League, Foot­ball League, Na­tional League and women’s game.</p>
