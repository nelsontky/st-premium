    <p>A small group of us seniors took a morn­ing tour of Sin­ga­pore’s her­itage sites last Fri­day.</p>
    <p>We were out to re­dis­cover a slice of our rich cos­mopoli­tan cul­ture while help­ing to con­trib­ute in a small way to the lo­cal econ­omy.</p>
    <p>It was a walk down mem­ory lane made pos­si­ble by a tour op­er­a­tor, tour guide and van driver.</p>
    <p>We re­dis­cov­ered and re­lived fond mem­o­ries of grow­ing up in Sin­ga­pore in the 1960s and 1970s. We also learnt things about places we did not know be­fore, just like we would on over­seas hol­i­days.</p>
    <p>Among the places we dis­cov­ered was found­ing prime min­is­ter Lee Kuan Yew’s grand­par­ents’ house at 147 Neil Road (above), where he stayed as a child.</p>
    <p>In the Spot­tis­woode Park area, mu­rals de­pict­ing life in early Sin­ga­pore adorn walls. A part of Ar­me­nian Street has been pedes­tri­anised and turned into a park with trees bear­ing fruit that pro­vide flavours for Per­anakan cook­ing. We found out Sin­ga­pore’s na­tional flower, the Vanda Miss Joaquim or­chid, is now known as Papil­io­nan­the Miss Joaquim.</p>
    <p>End­ing the tour with a Per­anakan lunch was an apt way to com­plete the re­dis­cov­ery jour­ney. The restau­rant’s owner took us on a tour of his Per­anakan fam­ily’s pri­vate gallery.</p>
    <p>I hope more res­i­dents will sup­port our tourism in­dus­try, with or with­out the Sin­gapoRedis­cov­ers vouch­ers. When there are more lo­cal tourists, Sin­ga­pore’s many small busi­nesses and free­lancers will have a bet­ter chance of sur­viv­ing the cur­rent cri­sis.</p>
