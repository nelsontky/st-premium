    <p>A babysit­ter ac­cused of poi­son­ing two ba­bies un­der her care ad­mit­ted in court yes­ter­day that she had lied in a po­lice state­ment and in a court doc­u­ment.</p>
    <p>In her state­ment to the po­lice in De­cem­ber 2016, Sa’adiah Ja­mari said when one of the ba­bies had flu, she crushed half an adult flu tablet as she had no such med­i­ca­tion at hand for chil­dren.</p>
    <p>But in court yes­ter­day, Sa’adiah said she had lied, adding: “(I was) pro­voked by the po­lice. So, I had to say I gave some­thing.”</p>
    <p>On Tues­day, she also de­nied ad­min­is­ter­ing her med­i­ca­tions to the two chil­dren.</p>
    <p>The 39-year-old Sin­ga­porean is ac­cused of two counts of giv­ing poi­sons to the baby girls with the in­ten­tion of hurt­ing them.</p>
    <p>One of them was just five months old at the time, while the other was 11 months old. They are not re­lated to each other.</p>
    <p>Af­ter Sa’adiah looked af­ter them on sep­a­rate oc­ca­sions in late 2016, an as­sort­ment of drugs were later de­tected in the ba­bies.</p>
    <p>These in­cluded chlor­pheni­ramine, which is an an­ti­his­tamine, as well as di­azepam and al­pra­zo­lam, which are used to treat anx­i­ety dis­or­ders.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, the court heard that all the drugs found in the ba­bies had also been de­tected in Sa’adiah in 2016.</p>
    <p>Separately, in ear­lier court doc­u­ments known as the sum­mary of the de­fence, Sa’adiah had stated that she was pre­scribed with al­pra­zo­lam, or Xanax, only in 2018.</p>
    <p>She had also stated she had never been pre­scribed di­azepam, or Val­ium, from 2016 to last year.</p>
    <p>But on Tues­day, she tes­ti­fied in court that both drugs had been pre­scribed to her in 2016.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, Deputy Pub­lic Pros­e­cu­tor Seah Ee Wei ques­tioned Sa’adiah about her pre­scrip­tion for both drugs.</p>
    <p>The babysit­ter then ad­mit­ted that she had lied in the sum­mary of the de­fence on her al­pra­zo­lam pre­scrip­tion.</p>
    <p>Sa’adiah, how­ever, de­nied that she had lied in or­der to dis­tance her­self from the drugs found in the two ba­bies.</p>
    <p>Ini­tially, she also ad­mit­ted to ly­ing about her di­azepam pre­scrip­tion in the sum­mary. But she later told Dis­trict Judge John Ng: “I’m not ly­ing. I just can’t re­mem­ber.”</p>
    <p>Sa’adiah is now out on bail of $10,000 and the trial re­sumes to­day.</p>
