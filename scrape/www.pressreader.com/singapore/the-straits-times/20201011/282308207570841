    <p>While the food did not re­veal sur­prises, be­cause the pop­u­lar eater­ies are not new to me, I dis­cov­ered many sides of Gey­lang I had never seen be­fore.</p>
    <p>Ev­ery day, streams of peo­ple walk past the Ho Kee Pau shop in Lorong 27 Gey­lang. Many stop for a hot bun.</p>
    <p>Few, if any, take a sec­ond look at a small bull-like sculp­ture in the glass win­dow out front. Those who do will be sur­prised to learn it is an art­work by Cul­tural Medal­lion re­cip­i­ent Iskan­dar Jalil worth some $120,000.</p>
    <p>This is one of the tasty morsels I en­joy on Sins & Sal­va­tion: A Gey­lang Food Walk, a lo­cal tour to re­dis­cover Sin­ga­pore neigh­bour­hoods.</p>
    <p>Gey­lang, Sin­ga­pore’s largest des­ig­nated red light area, is known for good food and many eater­ies which open till the wee hours to cater to night­birds and those who flocked there, pre-pan­demic, to seek other plea­sures.</p>
    <p>I used to avoid the place be­cause it was crowded and park­ing was a night­mare. On my oc­ca­sional food crawls there, it was eat and go.</p>
    <p>But this walk­ing tour, af­ter the on­set of Covid-19, ap­pealed to me. Gey­lang was far less con­gested and I was able to en­joy the food with­out the stress.</p>
    <p>The evening started at 6.30pm on a Fri­day at Alju­nied MRT sta­tion, where our guide Tony Tan, 48, had ar­ranged to meet us. The weekly tour by his tour com­pany Be­tel Box is for four par­tic­i­pants, who pay $80 each for more than four hours of eat­ing and walk­ing.</p>
    <p>Ho Kee Pau, a short walk from the sta­tion, was the first stop, where we set­tled down for a quick brief­ing and had hear­ing sets dis­trib­uted to us. While we downed dim sum like siew mai and lor mai gai, Mr Tan gave us a run­down of Gey­lang’s history.</p>
    <p>There are a few the­o­ries on how it got its name, one of which is de­rived from a mis­spelling of the Malay word “ki­lang”, which means fac­tory. It ap­par­ently used to be a leather in­dus­try hub, and a few old com­pa­nies trad­ing in leather still dot the lorongs.</p>
    <p>The north­ern sec­tion was swamp­land, thus the name Paya Le­bar, which is Malay for “wide swamp”. There were lemon­grass (“serai” in Malay) plan­ta­tions too, thus the name Gey­lang Serai for another sec­tion.</p>
    <p>But as the farms and swamps were cleared, bars started pop­ping up to form a red light area.</p>
    <p>Mr Tan also re­galed us with how Ho Kee Pau grew from a stall in Gey­lang into an is­land­wide chain, and how its owner is an art lover who also runs the Black Earth Art Gallery in Joo Chiat Road – which ex­plains the sculp­ture in the win­dow.</p>
    <p>For the dim sum, go for the char siew bao, which is smaller than most and has a dis­tinct taste of co­rian­der in the pork fill­ing. But avoid the har gau, which has a thick skin.</p>
    <p>Pace your­self, he re­peat­edly ad­vised, be­cause over the course of the tour, we would taste about 16 food items at four stops. But there would also be plenty of walk­ing to work it off.</p>
    <p>For the next hour, we wan­dered through the odd-num­ber lorongs from Alju­nied Road to Gey­lang Road.</p>
    <p>This area has one of the high­est den­sity of re­li­gious or­gan­i­sa­tions, many of them housed next to one another.</p>
    <p>On an up­per floor of what looked like an of­fice build­ing, we saw sign­boards for Bud­dhist, Taoist and Chris­tian groups. There was a gongfu cen­tre, too, in the mix.</p>
    <p>Mr Tan also pointed out a place where peo­ple put their ances­tral tablets. We stopped at many tem­ples, in­clud­ing one that ap­peared like it was built partly in a cave.</p>
    <p>Be­cause of pan­demic safety mea­sures, many of these were closed to the pub­lic, af­ford­ing us only a peek from the en­trance. But I learnt to tell the sex of the two stone lions that usu­ally guard their doors. The fe­male is usu­ally de­picted with a cub at its feet.</p>
    <p>Un­like the more run-down build­ings in the lorongs, the shop­houses in Gey­lang Road have been metic­u­lously con­served so their orig­i­nal fa­cades re­main.</p>
    <p>There was an old bun­ga­low with a large com­pound at the Alju­nied Road junc­tion that I had never no­ticed be­fore.</p>
    <p>You could tell that it was built for a trader, said Mr Tan, be­cause of the high ceil­ing of the ground floor. Ap­par­ently, that was so his bul­lock cart could pull up right at his ve­randa and the goods could be un­loaded di­rectly into the house.</p>
    <p>From the main road, we walked into the even-num­ber lanes, where the broth­els, now closed, are. Un­like pre­vi­ously, when the area was packed, it was now de­press­ingly quiet. Mr Tan paused to give a summary of the pros­ti­tu­tion trade, which is le­gal and comes with a rigid set of rules laid down by the au­thor­i­ties.</p>
    <p>The next stop got us more ex­cited as we sat down at the pop­u­lar Lorong 9 Beef Hor Fun, right across from the well-known Gey­lang Lorong 9 Frog Por­ridge. I was sur­prised to learn that you could sit at ei­ther stall and or­der food from both.</p>
    <p>I had tasted the hor fun years ago, but was turned off by the sodium bi­car­bon­ate used to ten­derise the beef. Hap­pily, it tasted bet­ter this time.</p>
    <p>The frog por­ridge – com­pris­ing a clay­pot of con­gee sim­mered in stock and another of frog legs cooked in dark soya sauce – re­tained its stan­dard.</p>
    <p>But I was more im­pressed by the oys­ter omelette hot plate from the same cof­fee shop, with fresh and plump oys­ters sit­ting on a layer of fluffy egg.</p>
    <p>There was sam­bal stingray too, as well as zichar dishes like cof­fee pork ribs, ce­real prawns and salted egg prawns – all top picks of the hun­dreds of tourists who have been on this tour, which has run for 12 years now, says Mr Tan.</p>
    <p>There was too much food and we still had two more stops, so left­overs were packed to be taken home.</p>
    <p>Next up was a Hong Kong-style eatery called 126 Dim Sum Wen Dao Shi in Sims Av­enue, but in­stead of sit­ting down, Mr Tan or­dered some baked good­ies to go in­stead, so we could en­joy them with durian at the next stop.</p>
    <p>So while wait­ing for a Mao Shan Wang durian to be prised open, we took bites of egg tarts, wal­nut cook­ies, steamed ma lai gou and co­conut tarts. Be­cause it was around the Mid-Au­tumn Fes­ti­val, we had mini moon­cakes too.</p>
    <p>Stuffed and reek­ing of durian, we took our last walk back into the lorongs. At the junc­tion of Lorong 19 and Lorong Ba­chok was the most sur­pris­ing find of the evening – a shop­house with a highly dec­o­ra­tive, colour­ful fa­cade.</p>
    <p>Built in 1929, it has pan­els de­pict­ing clas­sic Chi­nese tales and fan­tas­ti­cal ele­phants and other an­i­mals. Most in­ter­est­ing of all were Sikh and Se­poy guards moulded in re­lief on pil­lars flank­ing the en­trance to guard the build­ing.</p>
    <p>So while the food did not re­veal sur­prises, be­cause the pop­u­lar eater­ies are not new to me, I dis­cov­ered many sides of Gey­lang I had never seen be­fore.</p>
    <p>For in­for­ma­tion on the tour and to book, go to www.betel­box­tours.com. It costs $80 a per­son and is only for those aged 18 and above. The price in­cludes all meals. Turn up with a hearty ap­petite and com­fort­able walk­ing shoes.</p>
