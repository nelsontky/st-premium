    <p>BRASILIA • Brazil is be­ing bat­tered by the coronaviru­s crisis, but the dam­age is un­even across the sprawl­ing South Amer­i­can coun­try, where ex­perts say chaotic pol­i­cy­mak­ing has only made a com­pli­cated sit­u­a­tion worse.</p>
    <p>Like the United States – the only coun­try that has recorded more in­fec­tions and deaths in the pan­demic – Brazil is a con­ti­nent-sized gi­ant with myr­iad re­gions and sub-re­gions, held to­gether by a fed­eral sys­tem that can breed a con­fus­ing ca­coph­ony of na­tional, state and lo­cal poli­cies even at the best of times.</p>
    <p>Brazil reg­is­tered 51,147 new Covid-19 cases and 1,211 deaths in the pre­vi­ous 24 hours, its Min­istry of Health an­nounced on Satur­day. The na­tional sta­tis­tics on the new coronaviru­s – more than 2.3 mil­lion in­fec­tions and 86,499 deaths – mask a var­ied panorama across the coun­try of 212 mil­lion peo­ple.</p>
    <p>“It’s very het­ero­ge­neous,” said Dr Marcelo Gomes of lead­ing public health re­search in­sti­tute Fiocruz.</p>
    <p>Brazil’s 27 states are all fac­ing dif­fer­ent epi­demics. Even within states, “things can change a lot from one re­gion to the next”, Dr Gomes told Agence France-Presse.</p>
    <p>Na­tion­wide, the curve of daily Covid-19 deaths in Brazil has been in a long plateau since last month, al­beit in a very high range. At the state level, things are murkier.</p>
    <p>On av­er­age over the past seven days, four states posted de­clin­ing daily death tolls, in­clud­ing on­cedev­as­tated Ama­zonas in the north and Ceara in the north-east.</p>
    <p>Ten had ris­ing num­bers, in­clud­ing in the south and west-cen­tral re­gions, which had been less af­fected un­til re­cently. And 13 were ba­si­cally stable, in­clud­ing Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro, the two hard­esthit states.</p>
    <p>In some states, in­clud­ing Ceara and Rio de Janeiro, there is talk of a “sec­ond wave, even though the first wave never re­ally ta­pered off”, said Dr Gomes.</p>
    <p>Pres­i­dent Jair Bol­sonaro has down­played the pan­demic, com­par­ing the virus to a “lit­tle flu” and call­ing the re­ac­tion to it “hys­te­ria”.</p>
    <p>The far-right leader, who reg­u­larly de­fies so­cial dis­tanc­ing guide­lines, tested pos­i­tive for the virus him­self on July 7 af­ter de­vel­op­ing a fever and fa­tigue.</p>
    <p>On Satur­day, af­ter spend­ing nearly three weeks in self-iso­la­tion at the pres­i­den­tial palace, he said he had tested neg­a­tive for the virus – cred­it­ing his con­tro­ver­sial use of the anti-malar­ial drug hy­drox­y­chloro­quine, whose ef­fi­cacy against Covid-19 has not been proven.</p>
    <p>Amid Mr Bol­sonaro’s at­tacks on stay-at-home mea­sures to con­tain the virus, the Supreme Court gave the state and lo­cal au­thor­i­ties the final say in the mat­ter.</p>
    <p>But states and mu­nic­i­pal­i­ties have im­posed an in­el­e­gant hodge­podge of quar­an­tine mea­sures, with lit­tle in the way of en­force­ment and a wide­spread lack of ad­her­ence. That has been fol­lowed, in some cases, by poorly de­signed poli­cies to re­open the econ­omy, which many ex­perts have deemed pre­ma­ture.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, the an­nual New Year’s Eve cel­e­bra­tions, which tra­di­tion­ally see mil­lions of peo­ple gath­ered on Copaca­bana Beach in Rio de Janeiro, have been can­celled this year.</p>
    <p>The cel­e­bra­tions are “not vi­able in this pan­demic sce­nario, with­out a vac­cine”, the city’s tourism of­fice said in a state­ment, not­ing that the world-fa­mous Car­ni­val cel­e­bra­tions, nor­mally set for Fe­bru­ary, might also have to be can­celled. In­stead, a vir­tual New Year cel­e­bra­tion is be­ing planned.</p>
    <p>The World Health Or­gan­i­sa­tion said last week that Brazil fi­nally ap­peared to have reached the plateau, urg­ing it to use the oc­ca­sion to take con­trol.</p>
    <p>“We’re still a long way from that. It’s not that we’re not see­ing the light at the end of the tun­nel. We can’t even see the tun­nel,” said Dr Jose David Ur­baez, an in­fec­tious dis­ease spe­cial­ist at Asa Norte Re­gional Hospi­tal in Brasilia.</p>
