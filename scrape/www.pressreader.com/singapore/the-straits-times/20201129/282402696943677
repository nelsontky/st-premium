    <p>When Gifty is asked by her dates what her neu­ro­science grad­u­ate re­search en­tails, she quips that she gets mice hooked on co­caine and then takes it away from them.</p>
    <p>This is not strictly true – co­caine is ex­pen­sive, so she is now get­ting the mice ad­dicted to En­sure, a nu­tri­tional drink.</p>
    <p>But be­hind the glib­ness lies a gulf of hurt. When she was a child, her brother died of a drug over­dose. Her mother, over­come by de­pres­sion, re­fuses to get out of bed.</p>
    <p>With every mouse Gifty ex­per­i­ments on, she delves a lit­tle deeper into the in­ex­pli­ca­ble work­ings of the hu­man mind, to­wards an an­swer for why her bril­liant brother turned from shoot­ing hoops to heroin, why her once-in­domitable mother now colonises her bed “like a virus”.</p>
    <p>Yaa Gyasi, who was born i n Ghana and grew up in the United States, made a splash with her pow­er­ful de­but novel Home­go­ing (2016), the saga of two half-sis­ters in 18th-cen­tury Ghana – one en­slaved, the other mar­ry­ing into power – and their de­scen­dants.</p>
    <p>Tran­scen­dent King­dom, her sophomore novel, re­fo­cuses that sweep­ing scope into the pa­ram­e­ters of a sci­ence ex­per­i­ment, bal­anc­ing clin­i­cal de­tach­ment with pro­found grief.</p>
    <p>The novel moves back and forth through Gifty’s life – from her mis­fit child­hood in Alabama as the daugh­ter of Ghana­ian im­mi­grants – to the mi­cro-ag­gres­sions she faces as a young black fe­male sci­en­tist at Stan­ford Univer­sity.</p>
    <p>She has lit­tle mem­ory of her fa­ther, the Chin Chin Man, nick­named after the snack he liked. Un­able to cope with the dis­crim­i­na­tion he faced as a black jan­i­tor in the US, he went back to Ghana for a visit and never re­turned.</p>
    <p>It is an aban­don­ment Gifty’s older brother Nana never quite re­cov­ers from. His bright fu­ture in sports is de­railed when a doc­tor pre­scribes him opi­oid med­i­ca­tion for an in­jury.</p>
    <p>“Their kind does seem to have a taste for drugs,” re­marks a fel­low wor­ship­per at the white evan­gel­i­cal church they at­tend.</p>
    <p>Their mother en­dures drudgery as a carer for the el­derly, frets over every cent and thinks say­ing “I love you” is “white peo­ple fool­ish­ness”.</p>
    <p>“My first thought, the year my brother died and my mother took to bed, was that I needed her to be mine again, a mother as I un­der­stood it,” says Gifty.</p>
    <p>“And when she didn’t get up, when she lay there day in and day out, wast­ing away, I was re­minded that I didn’t know her, not wholly and com­pletely. I would never know her.”</p>
    <p>Gifty’s nar­ra­tive can verge on di­dac­tic – much of it is her thrash­ing out the­o­log­i­cal ar­gu­ments with her­self, as she works through her com­plex re­la­tion­ship with God and the un­know­able facets of the uni­verse.</p>
    <p>But the novel’s bril­liance lies in its scalpel-keen pre­ci­sion, as Gifty peels apart the lay­ers of the mind and nav­i­gates the fine line be­tween sci­ence and faith, search­ing for that elu­sive thing called a soul.</p>
    <p>If you like this, read: Real Life by Bran­don Tay­lor (River­head, 2020, $44.89, avail­able at bit.ly/RealLife_BT), a Booker Prize-short­listed novel about Wal­lace, a gay black bio­sciences re­search stu­dent who feels like an out­sider at his mostly white univer­sity i n the Amer­i­can Mid­west.</p>
