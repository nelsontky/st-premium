    <p>TOKYO Or­gan­is­ers said they were on con­stant alert for cy­ber at­tacks yes­ter­day but had yet to suf­fer “sig­nif­i­cant im­pact” af­ter Bri­tain ac­cused Rus­sia of tar­get­ing the Tokyo Olympics.</p>
    <p>Bri­tain’s for­eign min­istry said Rus­sian spies at­tacked the 2020 Games’ or­gan­is­ers, lo­gis­tics ser­vices and spon­sors be­fore the event was post­poned by one year be­cause of the coro­n­avirus pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Tokyo 2020 of­fi­cials said they had taken a range of coun­ter­mea­sures against dig­i­tal at­tacks but did not dis­close de­tails, cit­ing se­cu­rity con­cerns.</p>
    <p>“While we have con­stantly mon­i­tored var­i­ous types of cy­ber at­tack on the dig­i­tal plat­forms owned by Tokyo 2020, no sig­nif­i­cant im­pact has been ob­served in our op­er­a­tions,” an or­gan­is­ing com­mit­tee state­ment said.</p>
    <p>Ja­pan’s Olympic Min­is­ter Seiko Hashimoto de­clined to di­rectly ad­dress the re­port yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>But the for­mer speed skater and track cy­clist said that “since the Lon­don Games, cy­ber at­tacks have been in­creas­ing”.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, Chief Cabi­net Sec­re­tary Kat­sunobu Kato also told a news con­fer­ence that Ja­pan was in close con­tact with the United States and United King­dom over the is­sue and was gath­er­ing and analysing in­for­ma­tion, but did not give fur­ther de­tails.</p>
    <p>Bri­tish daily The Guardian said al­leged dig­i­tal re­con­nais­sance work on Tokyo 2020 had in­cluded spear phish­ing – mes­sages dis­guised to ap­pear as if from a trusted friend or busi­ness con­nec­tion, but which con­tain mal­ware.</p>
    <p>The planned at­tack also in­cluded set­ting up fake web­sites and re­search­ing in­di­vid­u­als’ ac­count se­cu­rity, the news­pa­per said.</p>
    <p>Bri­tain’s al­le­ga­tions came as six Rus­sian mil­i­tary in­tel­li­gence of­fi­cers were charged in Amer­ica with car­ry­ing out cy­ber at­tacks on Ukraine’s power grid, the 2017 French elec­tions and the 2018</p>
    <p>Pyeongchan­g Win­ter Olympics.</p>
    <p>The US Jus­tice Depart­ment said the Pyeongchan­g Games were tar­geted af­ter Rus­sian ath­letes were banned from par­tic­i­pat­ing un­der their own flag be­cause of gov­ern­ment-spon­sored dop­ing ef­forts.</p>
    <p>“Their cy­ber at­tack com­bined the emo­tional ma­tu­rity of a petu­lant child with the re­sources of a na­tion state,” As­sis­tant At­tor­ney-Gen­eral John De­mers said, adding that they at­tempted to pin it on North Korea.</p>
    <p>“Dur­ing the open­ing cer­e­mony, they launched the ‘Olympic De­stroyer’ mal­ware at­tack, which deleted data from thou­sands of com­put­ers sup­port­ing the Games, ren­der­ing them in­op­er­a­ble.”</p>
    <p>Lee Hee-beom, for­mer pres­i­dent and chief ex­ec­u­tive of­fi­cer of the</p>
    <p>Ath­letes com­pet­ing dur­ing the Golden Grand Prix meet at the Olympic Sta­dium in Tokyo in Au­gust. The new sta­dium will be one of the venues for the Tokyo 2020 Games which were post­poned to next year be­cause of the coro­n­avirus pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Pyeongchan­g or­gan­is­ing com­mit­tee, said he was un­aware who was re­spon­si­ble for the at­tack un­til now.</p>
    <p>“There was a hack­ing on the open­ing day but we could not con­firm its source,” he said of the in­ci­dent that oc­curred two years ago.</p>
    <p>“In­ter­net con­nec­tion was lost right af­ter the cer­e­mony from the hack­ing and we had to mo­bilise ex­perts to re­store it all night.</p>
    <p>“Un­til now, I did not know who had done it.”</p>
    <p>An In­ter­na­tional Olympic Com­mit­tee (IOC) spokesman said it has placed em­pha­sis on cy­ber se­cu­rity.</p>
    <p>“The IOC and the or­gan­is­ing com­mit­tees of the Olympic Games have iden­ti­fied cy­ber se­cu­rity as a pri­or­ity area and in­vest a lot to of­fer the Olympic Games the best cy­ber se­cu­rity en­vi­ron­ment pos­si­ble,” the spokesman said in an e-mail.</p>
    <p>“Given the na­ture of the topic, we do not di­vulge those mea­sures.”</p>
