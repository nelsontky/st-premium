    <p>BANGKOK • Some stu­dents at Thai­land’s Tham­masat Uni­ver­sity posed with card­board cutouts of well-known crit­ics of the monar­chy yes­ter­day in a protest as King Maha Va­ji­ra­longkorn was to present de­grees amid grow­ing calls for royal re­form.</p>
    <p>Youth and stu­dent-led demon­stra­tions that be­gan in July by de­mand­ing the oust­ing of for­mer junta leader Prayut Chan-o-cha as Prime Min­is­ter have in­creas­ingly called for curbs on the King’s pow­ers, break­ing a long­stand­ing taboo.</p>
    <p>State broad­caster Thai PBS quoted a source as say­ing that only around half of this year’s 9,600 Tham­masat grad­u­ates joined re­hearsals that are es­sen­tial for those at­tend­ing the de­gree cer­e­mony.</p>
    <p>Last year, it said, only 10 per cent missed the fi­nal cer­e­mony.</p>
    <p>Mr Prayut warned stu­dents on Fri­day not to dis­rupt the grad­u­a­tion cer­e­monies at Tham­masat, long seen as a cen­tre of rad­i­cal­ism.</p>
    <p>Stu­dent protesters have set up on cam­pus life-size card­board cutouts of his­to­rian Som­sak Jeam­teerasakul and for­mer diplo­mat Pavin Chachavalp­ong­pun, widely fol­lowed crit­ics of the monar­chy who live in self-ex­ile.</p>
    <p>“I chose to take a pic­ture with Som­sak be­cause I re­spect him and I don’t think he de­serves what­ever hap­pened to him for speak­ing the truth and bravely crit­i­cis­ing the monar­chy openly,” said one 23-year-old stu­dent, who gave his name as Marut.</p>
    <p>Many stu­dents who were at the cer­e­mony with their fam­i­lies ig­nored the cutouts.</p>
    <p>The grad­u­a­tion cer­e­mony with ac­com­pa­ny­ing pho­tos is a rite of pas­sage in Thai­land.</p>
    <p>Many fam­i­lies dis­play gilt­framed pic­tures of grad­u­ates re­ceiv­ing their de­grees from the monarch, a prac­tice be­gun last cen­tury to strengthen royal bonds with the mid­dle class.</p>
    <p>But this year’s protests have posed the big­gest chal­lenge to the palace since the 1932 re­volt that ended ab­so­lute monar­chy.</p>
    <p>A week-long gov­ern­ment crack­down in mid-Oc­to­ber, with a ban on protests and the ar­rest of many protest lead­ers, back­fired when it prompted big­ger demon­stra­tions.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, three prom­i­nent prodemoc­racy lead­ers were sent to hos­pi­tal af­ter chaos broke out out­side a Bangkok po­lice sta­tion overnight when they were re-ar­rested.</p>
    <p>Ac­tivists Panupong “Mike” Jad­nok, Panusaya “Rung” Sithi­ji­rawat­tanakul and Parit “Pen­guin” Chi­warak have been in cus­tody since the mid­dle of last month on sedi­tion charges but po­lice sought to ques­tion them fur­ther af­ter their de­ten­tion ex­pired.</p>
    <p>Po­lice said one of them was sent to the hos­pi­tal af­ter he had a “re­ac­tion”. But lawyers and other ac­tivists said Mr Panupong had been put in a choke­hold by po­lice while his col­leagues suf­fered from fa­tigue af­ter po­lice ques­tion­ing.</p>
