    <p>This month marks the 75th an­niver­sary of the nu­clear bomb at­tacks on Hiroshima and Na­gasaki. It comes at a time when fears are mount­ing for re­gional se­cu­rity as a re­sult of the nu­cle­ari­sa­tion of the US-China ri­valry, says Pro­fes­sor C. Raja Mo­han.</p>
    <p>Sev­enty-five years af­ter the United States dropped atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Na­gasaki on Aug 6 and 9, 1945, re­spec­tively, Asia is com­ing back to the cen­tre stage of global nu­clear pol­i­tics as the ten­sions be­tween the US and China ac­quire an atomic di­men­sion.</p>
    <p>An in­cip­i­ent arms race in Asia in strate­gic weapons prom­ises to desta­bilise the se­cu­rity or­der in the re­gion.</p>
    <p>For Asia, that is a dou­ble tragedy. Meet­ing for the first time in 1946, at the dawn of the atomic age, the Gen­eral Assem­bly of the newly founded United Na­tions in its very first res­o­lu­tion had called for the abo­li­tion of nu­clear weapons and all other weapons of mass de­struc­tion.</p>
    <p>Since then, de­spite re­peated diplo­matic ef­forts, treaty com­mit­ments, ma­jor po­lit­i­cal mo­ments like the end of the Cold War, mass protests, in­ter­na­tional court judg­ments that they are il­le­gal and reli­gious dicta on their im­moral­ity, there has been no con­sen­sus among the great pow­ers on whether and how to elim­i­nate nu­clear weapons.</p>
    <p>Se­cond, Asia is no longer mar­ginal to the nu­clear dy­nam­ics among the ma­jor pow­ers.</p>
    <p>Asia had no choice but to con­tem­plate the eco­nomic and po­lit­i­cal con­se­quences of the un­fold­ing con­test be­tween the US and China. But the re­gion is yet to con­sider the im­pli­ca­tions of the nu­cle­ari­sa­tion of the Sino-US con­flict. The 75th an­niver­sary of the atomic bomb­ing of Ja­pan is a good mo­ment to be­gin that re­flec­tion.</p>
    <p>THE MAN­HAT­TAN PROJECT</p>
    <p>That Ja­pan was the first and only tar­get of nu­clear weapons was per­haps en­tirely in­ci­den­tal. The race to de­velop nu­clear weapons be­gan a few years be­fore 1945 amid con­cerns that Nazi Ger­many was de­vel­op­ing nu­clear weapons. As lead­ing sci­en­tists, in­clud­ing Al­bert Ein­stein, drew at­ten­tion to the emerg­ing atomic threat in 1939, the Roo­sevelt ad­min­is­tra­tion em­barked on the Man­hat­tan Project to de­velop atomic weapons.</p>
    <p>The first test of an atomic bomb took place on July 16, 1945, by which time Hitler’s armies in Europe had been de­feated. As the US be­gan to con­sider us­ing the new weapon against Im­pe­rial Ja­pan, a num­ber of sci­en­tists in the Man­hat­tan Project, led by Dr James Franck, ob­jected to its use. They pointed to the enor­mous de­struc­tive power of the atomic weapon and the in­evitabil­ity of other coun­tries ac­quir­ing them. They called in­stead for a pub­lic demon­stra­tion of its hor­rific ef­fects and to ini­ti­ate a process for their in­ter­na­tional con­trol.</p>
    <p>That ad­vice was not taken by Pres­i­dent Harry Tru­man. Since then, the prin­ci­pal jus­ti­fi­ca­tion for the drop­ping of the bomb on Hiroshima and Na­gasaki was the claim that it was nec­es­sary to bring the war in Asia to an early close and save the valu­able lives of Amer­i­can sol­diers. But many re­vi­sion­ist his­to­ri­ans ques­tion that claim. Although Ja­pan was the vic­tim of the atomic bomb­ing, they ar­gue, the real po­lit­i­cal tar­get was the Soviet Union.</p>
    <p>FIRST ACT OF THE COLD WAR</p>
    <p>Some con­tem­po­rary ob­servers had called the atomic bomb­ing of Ja­pan not the last act of World War II, but the first act of the Cold War. Put sim­ply, the ar­gu­ment was that the nu­clear use in Ja­pan was about ex­clud­ing Soviet Rus­sia from the post-war set­tle­ment in Asia.</p>
    <p>In Europe, Washington had to share the po­lit­i­cal spoils of the war with Moscow. There was no choice, given the Red Army’s role in de­feat­ing Nazi Ger­many. The US was ea­ger, the ar­gu­ment goes, to avoid a sim­i­lar out­come, given the plans for mo­bil­is­ing the Red Army to force Im­pe­rial Ja­pan’s de­feat. Other his­to­ri­ans ar­gue that Em­peror Hiro­hito was pre­par­ing to sur­ren­der in any case and there was no need for the use of atomic weapons against Ja­pan.</p>
    <p>Many his­to­ri­ans re­search­ing the US’ de­ci­sion to use nu­clear weapons against Ja­pan do not con­cur with th­ese views. But there was no ques­tion that the atomic fo­cus quickly shifted to Europe as Soviet Rus­sia was seen as an ex­is­ten­tial threat to the West. As the al­liance be­tween Rus­sia and the West, forged dur­ing World War II, mor­phed into an all-out con­fronta­tion in Europe, nu­clear weapons be­came quite cen­tral to the new tragedy that un­folded in Europe and across the At­lantic.</p>
    <p>Rus­sia fol­lowed Amer­ica to test its nu­clear weapons in 1949; Bri­tain and France joined the nu­clear club in 1952 and 1960 re­spec­tively. In the years that fol­lowed, the US be­gan to de­ploy hun­dreds of nu­clear weapons in Europe, in the name of de­ter­ring a Soviet ag­gres­sion. As the mil­i­tary con­fronta­tion es­ca­lated in Europe, Asia be­came in­creas­ingly mar­ginal to the nu­clear cal­cu­lus of the US and the Soviet Union.</p>
    <p>To be sure, the Asia-Pa­cific re­gion re­mained a test­ing ground for Amer­i­can, Bri­tish and French nu­clear weapon de­vel­op­ment. As the nu­clear con­tes­ta­tion be­came global, many Asian na­tions be­came sites for the lo­ca­tion and tran­sit of nu­clear weapons, and the af­fil­i­ated in­fra­struc­ture of bases and com­mu­ni­ca­tion fa­cil­i­ties.</p>
    <p>The Peo­ple’s Repub­lic of China tested its first atomic weapon in Oc­to­ber 1964. In­dia tested a nu­clear de­vice a decade later in 1974, and was later fol­lowed by Pak­istan and North Korea. Is­rael never ad­mit­ted to any nu­clear test, but no one doubts the ex­is­tence of its atomic arsenal.</p>
    <p>Although many Asian pow­ers crashed into the atomic club, they made lit­tle dif­fer­ence to the cen­tral nu­clear bal­ance be­tween the US and the Soviet Union.</p>
    <p>CHINA AND THE NU­CLEAR TREATIES</p>
    <p>The con­cerns of the great pow­ers were about pre­vent­ing the losers of World War II – Ger­many and Ja­pan – from ac­quir­ing nu­clear weapons. The US and Rus­sia de­vised the nu­clear non-pro­lif­er­a­tion treaty (NPT) in the late 1960s to cod­ify this pro­hi­bi­tion. The NPT, which came into force in 1970, also be­came an in­stru­ment to limit the spread of nu­clear weapons to the de­vel­op­ing world.</p>
    <p>The nor­mal­i­sa­tion of Sino-US re­la­tions since the 1970s sig­nif­i­cantly re­duced Amer­i­can con­cerns about the dan­gers of Chi­nese nu­clear weapons. China, too, sen­si­bly chose not to im­i­tate the US and Rus­sia in build­ing a large nu­clear arsenal. It was happy to fo­cus on a small arsenal that was enough to de­ter at­tacks from the nu­clear su­per­pow­ers – Amer­ica and Rus­sia.</p>
    <p>Given its marginal­ity to the great power nu­clear dy­namic, China was left out of the agree­ments that sought to reg­u­late the arms race be­tween the US and USSR. The Strate­gic Arms Re­duc­tion Treaties (Start) set caps on long-range nu­clear-armed mis­siles of Washington and Moscow and the In­ter­me­di­ate-Range Nu­clear Forces (INF) Treaty elim­i­nated US and Rus­sian medium-range mis­siles in Europe.</p>
    <p>China, of course, was part of mul­ti­lat­eral nu­clear ar­range­ments like the NPT. The end of the Cold War saw re­newed at­ten­tion to the prob­lem of pro­lif­er­a­tion and pro­vided a ba­sis for col­lab­o­ra­tion be­tween China and the US on lim­it­ing the nu­clear dan­gers in the Mid­dle East, South Asia and the Korean penin­sula.</p>
    <p>THE UN­RAV­EL­LING</p>
    <p>This rea­son­ably stable nu­clear frame­work has now be­gun to un­ravel amidst the break­down of the nearly four-decades-old US-China part­ner­ship. This is tied in­ex­tri­ca­bly to China’s rise and the grow­ing Amer­i­can con­cerns about it. Con­sider two re­cent de­vel­op­ments.</p>
    <p>Last year, the US with­drew from the INF treaty. Washington ar­gues that China’s ab­sence from the treaty had al­lowed it to de­velop an arsenal of medium-range mis­siles that now threaten US mil­i­tary pri­macy in Asia.</p>
    <p>This year, amid a de­bate on the fu­ture of the Start process with Moscow, the Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion called for Chi­nese par­tic­i­pa­tion in the talks on nu­clear force re­duc­tion. Bei­jing, of course, made it quite clear that it has no de­sire to join the nu­clear talks un­til Washington and Moscow bring down their ar­se­nals to its level.</p>
    <p>China’s long-range nu­clear force of about 300 weapons is barely one-fifth of the per­mit­ted de­ploy­ment of about 1,550 war­heads each for the US and Rus­sia. But the Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion ar­gues that China’s ex­pand­ing nu­clear forces are un­der­min­ing the bi­lat­eral process be­tween Washington and Moscow.</p>
    <p>Writ­ing in The New York Times last week, Mr James An­der­son, a top ad­min­is­tra­tion de­fence of­fi­cial, warned that China was rapidly ex­pand­ing its nu­clear forces and could dou­ble the size of its atomic arsenal over the next decade.</p>
    <p>“China’s nu­clear ex­pan­sion and its re­fusal to en­gage in mean­ing­ful di­a­logue will af­fect sta­bil­ity on mul­ti­ple lev­els,” Mr An­der­son said. “In­creased US nu­clear force re­quire­ments to en­sure cred­i­ble de­ter­rence against China would af­fect the United States-Rus­sia strate­gic nu­clear bal­ance and threaten to un­der­mine the prospects for fur­ther ne­go­ti­ated re­duc­tions.”</p>
    <p>The size of China’s nu­clear arsenal is not the only is­sue both­er­ing the US se­cu­rity es­tab­lish­ment as it em­barks on an ex­pan­sive mil­i­tary con­test with China in Asia.</p>
    <p>DOUBTS ABOUT U.S. SE­CU­RITY UM­BRELLA</p>
    <p>As the Peo­ple’s Lib­er­a­tion Army be­comes a pow­er­ful mil­i­tary force, there is grow­ing con­cern about the cred­i­bil­ity of the US’ “ex­tended de­ter­rence” to its al­lies in Asia.</p>
    <p>Ex­tended de­ter­rence refers to the “nu­clear um­brella” that the US of­fered to its Asian al­lies dur­ing the Cold War. The prom­ise of the US use of nu­clear weapons in the event of a Soviet at­tack, Amer­ica’s Asian al­lies be­lieved, would de­ter Soviet ag­gres­sion. This frame­work has be­gun to weaken amidst the rel­a­tive de­cline of Rus­sia and the rapid rise of China as a great mil­i­tary and eco­nomic power.</p>
    <p>Can the se­cu­rity frame­work de­signed to de­ter Rus­sia work against China? Amer­ica’s own deep eco­nomic in­ter­de­pen­dence with China raises ques­tions about the US’ will­ing­ness to de­fend its al­lies against an as­sertive Bei­jing. Mak­ing mat­ters worse has been Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump’s ques­tion­ing of the util­ity of al­liances and his de­mands on South Korea and Ja­pan to pay more for Amer­i­can mil­i­tary pres­ence on their soil.</p>
    <p>As the Asian na­tions ques­tion the re­li­a­bil­ity of the US’ se­cu­rity guar­an­tees and worry about China’s mus­cu­lar re­gional poli­cies, there is a grow­ing sense that they might have to beef up their own mil­i­tary ca­pa­bil­i­ties in this un­cer­tain se­cu­rity en­vi­ron­ment.</p>
    <p>Might this mean re­con­sid­er­ing the nu­clear weapon op­tion that Ja­pan, South Korea and Tai­wan had con­sid­ered in the past?</p>
    <p>Although the nu­clear op­tion is tempt­ing, few of them are ex­pected to go down that route. But many East Asian na­tions are look­ing to de­velop or ac­quire strate­gic weapons sys­tems, in­clud­ing long-range mis­siles.</p>
    <p>NEW WEAPONS, NEW DAN­GERS</p>
    <p>That brings us to the larger ques­tion of tech­no­log­i­cal change that con­tin­u­ally tested the sta­bil­ity of the nu­clear bal­ance in Europe and be­tween the US and Rus­sia. Asia is now likely to face a sim­i­lar chal­lenge as new tech­nolo­gies be­gin to stoke the ri­valry be­tween the US and China, as well as the long-term plan­ning of Bei­jing’s Asian neigh­bours.</p>
    <p>New de­vel­op­ments in lethal non-nu­clear ex­plo­sives, space weapons, mis­sile de­fences, un­der­wa­ter drones, cy­ber war­fare and hypersonic weapons that travel at five times the speed of sound are break­ing down the fire­wall be­tween con­ven­tional and nu­clear weapons.</p>
    <p>In the past, mil­i­tary tech­no­log­i­cal ad­vances trav­elled from the West to the East at a leisurely pace. To­day, China is at the fore­front of the de­vel­op­ment of some of th­ese tech­nolo­gies and in some ar­eas, the US is try­ing to catch up.</p>
    <p>That China is a key ac­tor in the cur­rent nu­clear power play and Asia is the main the­atre of great power joust­ing should wake up the re­gion to think through the con­se­quences.</p>
    <p>Un­til now, Asia’s nu­clear wor­ries were lim­ited to atomic pro­lif­er­a­tion and its im­pact on sub-re­gional con­flicts in the Mid­dle East, the sub­con­ti­nent and the Korean penin­sula.</p>
    <p>Like Europe in the Cold War, Asia must now en­gage with the con­se­quences of a great power nu­clear arms race cen­tred on it­self.</p>
