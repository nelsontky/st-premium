    <p>This Na­tional Day is be­ing ob­served in dif­fi­cult times. But such times have come be­fore. On the first Na­tional Day, the very sur­vival of Sin­ga­pore as a sov­er­eign na­tion was not guar­an­teed yet, to say noth­ing of its suc­cess – although that has since be­come syn­ony­mous with the coun­try’s in­de­pen­dence. Yet, that day in 1966 showed that the na­tion had ar­rived, within a year of its de­par­ture from Malaysia. The in­au­gu­ral pa­rade at the Padang brought to­gether cit­i­zens who did not look back at the tra­vails of their re­cent past but looked ahead at the heady mix of chal­lenges and op­por­tu­ni­ties that awaited them. Cer­tainly, some might have won­dered if the cel­e­bra­tions would prove to be pre­ma­ture. Yet the fear of the fu­ture did not paral­yse their hopes for the fu­ture.</p>
    <p>Today, the sen­ti­ment and sense of con­cern may, ar­guably, be lit­tle dif­fer­ent. Covid-19 is a global at­tack on the eco­nomic and so­cial fab­ric of Sin­ga­pore. The du­ra­tion of the out­break and its eco­nomic af­ter-ef­fects will test the ma­te­rial, so­cial and psy­cho­log­i­cal re­serves of this na­tion. How­ever, it can­not pose a worse threat than the dan­ger of be­ing ir­rel­e­vant to the world – the fate that Sin­ga­pore faced in the mid-1960s if it could not get its eco­nomic and po­lit­i­cal act to­gether.</p>
    <p>The sit­u­a­tion today is dif­fer­ent. Sin­ga­pore does not have to get to where oth­ers are on the lad­der of glob­al­i­sa­tion – although it has to re­tain and im­prove on its achieved place. While the at­mos­phere per­vad­ing today’s cel­e­bra­tions may be sub­dued, it pro­vides rea­son for re­flec­tion and hope. Bad times have come be­fore and may come again. But Sin­ga­pore over­came set­backs and chal­lenges over the decades. It can con­tinue to do so if the re­serves of na­tional spirit out­last the fear of at­tri­tion and change. The unity and pub­lic spirit­ed­ness that pre­vailed dur­ing the cri­sis have re­flected the re­silience of Sin­ga­pore­ans. And sen­ti­ments, like the flag, will still be high today.</p>
