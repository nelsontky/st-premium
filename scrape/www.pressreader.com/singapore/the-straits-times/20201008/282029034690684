    <p>Grow­ing up, Ms Me­gan Tang had to deal with taunts from her class­mates that she smelt like rot­ten eggs.</p>
    <p>Her eczema, which de­vel­oped when she was just 20 months old, was so se­vere that some part of her skin was al­ways cracked and seep­ing pus that emit­ted an odour.</p>
    <p>She had to straighten or bend her limbs cau­tiously, as her skin could “tear open”, caus­ing ex­cru­ci­at­ing pain, said Ms Tang.</p>
    <p>Her par­ents sought ways to al­le­vi­ate the sit­u­a­tion. These in­cluded ob­tain­ing pre­scrip­tion steroid creams, in­ject­ing en­e­mas, putting Ms Tang on a steamed veg­etable and brown rice diet and clean­ing her wounds with hy­dro­gen per­ox­ide.</p>
    <p>Though her eczema is now man­age­able through diet, stress re­liev­ing tech­niques and hor­mones, the med­i­cal trauma of her ex­pe­ri­ences when she was younger con­trib­uted to her men­tal health strug­gles.</p>
    <p>The re­jec­tion by her peers also led to so­cial anx­i­ety and feel­ings of in­se­cu­rity, said Ms Tang, 27, who was di­ag­nosed with gen­eral anx­i­ety dis­or­der, bipolar dis­or­der and ob­ses­sive com­pul­sive dis­or­der some years ago.</p>
    <p>The Tang fam­ily are no strangers to men­tal health strug­gles.</p>
    <p>Ms Tang’s mother, Pa­tri­cia, now 61, a pi­ano and drama teacher, suf­fered from post­na­tal de­pres­sion af­ter Ms Tang was born, and she some­times threat­ened to kill her­self and her baby.</p>
    <p>Ms Tang’s father, Martin, a mu­sic pro­ducer, also 61, took them with him to work so that he could keep an eye on them.</p>
    <p>The stress led him to burn out and de­velop de­pres­sion that lasted two years. He had to take a break from work and sell his com­pany and the fam­ily home. The fam­ily then stayed for a while with Ms Tang’s ma­ter­nal grand­par­ents.</p>
    <p>But de­spite her strug­gles with eczema and fit­ting in with her peers, Ms Tang felt her or­deal took a back seat be­cause of her brother Jesse, who is four years younger and has autism spec­trum dis­or­der.</p>
    <p>“My par­ents would al­ways say, ‘Look, your brother is suf­fer­ing so much more than you,’” said Ms Tang. “But this was my ev­ery­day (or­deal), and it shouldn’t have been un­der­mined or dis­missed.”</p>
    <p>Mr Tang said he un­der­stood his daughter bet­ter as she got older.</p>
    <p>“There was a lot of be­ing pa­tient and try­ing to un­der­stand her when she was grow­ing up, and we tried our best to help her come to grips on who she re­ally is,” he said.</p>
    <p>With her par­ents clueless as to how to help, she strug­gled alone.</p>
    <p>In pri­mary school, bul­lies called her names like “ugly duck­ling”. Once, they shoved her to the floor, caus­ing her to suf­fer a con­cus­sion and head in­jury. An­other time, they cut her hair with a pair of scis­sors.</p>
    <p>“Un­known to us, a lot of her friends had de­serted her. Kids can be so un­kind,” said Mr Tang.</p>
    <p>As a teen, Ms Tang be­gan ex­pe­ri­enc­ing symp­toms of bipolar dis­or­der, a men­tal health con­di­tion char­ac­terised by episodes of ex­treme mood swings.</p>
    <p>“I wanted to do very dras­tic and im­pul­sive things, like run across the road or steal things,” she said.</p>
    <p>Teach­ers thought she was naughty, and she was sus­pended from school sev­eral times. She turned to vices such as smok­ing, drink­ing and sniff­ing glue, and be­gan do­ing badly in school.</p>
    <p>Though she earned a place at Re­pub­lic Polytech­nic, she was kicked out in her first year for skip­ping class too many times.</p>
    <p>But things be­gan to turn around grad­u­ally. She be­gan work­ing with young peo­ple, do­ing com­mu­nity work and out­reach, and teach­ing song­writ­ing and dance with var­i­ous or­gan­i­sa­tions, in­spired in part by a fe­male pas­tor who had shown con­cern for her.</p>
    <p>“I be­gan to think, if this per­son can lis­ten to me, maybe I can lis­ten to these youth,” said Ms Tang.</p>
    <p>She later com­pleted a diploma in psy­chol­ogy at the Man­age­ment De­vel­op­ment In­sti­tute of Sin­ga­pore, and a de­gree in the same field at Ka­plan Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>She be­gan work­ing as a free­lance ther­a­pist and was hired to run youth pro­grammes at the Sin­ga­pore Girls’ Home, In­sti­tute of Men­tal Health and fam­ily ser­vice cen­tres.</p>
    <p>“For the first time in my life, I felt ful­filled,” she said.</p>
    <p>She now works as a full-time coun­sel­lor at Lim­it­less, a char­ity de­voted to youth men­tal health.</p>
    <p>At the same time, she is grow­ing her own start-up, The Shrub, which of­fers men­tor­ship pro­grammes and ther­apy us­ing na­ture.</p>
    <p>Her hus­band, Mr Arvin Dela Cruz, 31, an en­gi­neer she mar­ried last Novem­ber, runs it with her.</p>
    <p>As for her own men­tal health, Ms Tang sought pro­fes­sional help when she was 20, af­ter a par­tic­u­larly bad anx­i­ety at­tack. She then went on</p>
    <p>SEE­ING THE WORTH IN HER OWN LIFE</p>
    <p>I al­ways felt that peo­ple didn’t take me se­ri­ously. They didn’t know how bad it ac­tu­ally was. And many times, I thought if I killed my­self, then they would see. But I also re­alised I should see the worth in my own life since I know how much I’m strug­gling. I shouldn’t let peo­ple de­ter me from achiev­ing what I want to do.</p>
    <p>MS ME­GAN TANG, on how she used to feel she needed to prove her men­tal strug­gles were real. Some years ago, she was di­ag­nosed with gen­eral anx­i­ety dis­or­der, bipolar dis­or­der and ob­ses­sive com­pul­sive dis­or­der, and she sought pro­fes­sional help af­ter a par­tic­u­larly bad anx­i­ety at­tack.</p>
    <p>med­i­ca­tion and ther­apy for five years.</p>
    <p>One of her chal­lenges was feel­ing she needed to prove her men­tal strug­gles were real.</p>
    <p>“I al­ways felt that peo­ple didn’t take me se­ri­ously. They didn’t know how bad it ac­tu­ally was. And many times, I thought if I killed my­self, then they would see,” she said.</p>
    <p>“But I also re­alised I should see the worth in my own life since I know how much I’m strug­gling. I shouldn’t let peo­ple de­ter me from achiev­ing what I want to do.</p>
    <p>“Those re­ally bad days and nights, I would lie un­der my blan­ket to stop my­self from mov­ing so I (wouldn’t) take the next step and do some­thing stupid... I knew if I held on for those mo­ments, I could give a chance for the pain and emo­tion to dis­si­pate enough for me to con­tinue on.”</p>
    <p>She said she is grate­ful to her par­ents and hus­band for be­ing there and not giv­ing up on her.</p>
    <p>She now makes sure that, know­ing her own strug­gles, she sets bound­aries for her­self such as tak­ing time off when needed, and mak­ing sure she has a time buf­fer be­tween see­ing com­plex cases.</p>
    <p>Ms Tang be­lieves that her own ex­pe­ri­ences help her build trust with clients, as they feel she un­der­stands what they are go­ing through. She hopes one day to gather more sup­port for men­tal health pro­fes­sion­als.</p>
    <p>Sup­port from the team at Lim­it­less has been key for her, es­pe­cially from founder Asher Low, who pri­ori­tises the well-be­ing of his staff, she said.</p>
    <p>Her mes­sage to oth­ers who are strug­gling and feel­ing the stigma, dis­cour­ag­ing them from seek­ing help: “Don’t let oth­ers tell you that it ‘wasn’t that bad’ or ‘at least you didn’t suf­fer as much as so-andso’. It’s al­ways about how the event is ex­pe­ri­enced by the in­di­vid­ual and the per­sonal ef­fect it has on their lives.”</p>
