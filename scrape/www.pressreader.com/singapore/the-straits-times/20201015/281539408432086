    <p>Sin­ga­pore han­dled more phar­ma­ceu­ti­cal cargo in the first seven months of this year com­pared with the same pe­riod last year – an in­crease that comes on the heels of lo­cal ef­forts to boost air trans­port of tem­per­a­ture-sen­si­tive prod­ucts like vac­cines dur­ing the Covid-19 pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore han­dled more phar­ma­ceu­ti­cal cargo in the first seven months of this year com­pared with the same pe­riod last year – an in­crease that comes on the heels of lo­cal ef­forts to boost air trans­port of tem­per­a­ture-sen­si­tive prod­ucts like vac­cines dur­ing the Covid-19 pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Ground han­dler Sats – which has about 80 per cent of the mar­ket share at Changi Air­port – told The Straits Times that it saw a 15 per cent in­crease in phar­ma­ceu­ti­cal cargo through­put by weight be­tween Jan­uary and July, com­pared with the same pe­riod last year.</p>
    <p>This in­crease came de­spite global flight dis­rup­tions due to the pan­demic, which re­duced to­tal cargo ton­nage dur­ing this pe­riod, said a Sats spokesman on Tues­day af­ter queries from ST.</p>
    <p>Sats also said that since the open­ing of Sats Cool­port in 2010 – a pur­pose-built air­freight ter­mi­nal that can han­dle com­modi­ties with dif­fer­ent tem­per­a­ture re­quire­ments – Sin­ga­pore has at­tracted a larger mar­ket share of phar­ma­ceu­ti­cal cargo in Asia than its share of gen­eral air cargo.</p>
    <p>“We have seen this trend con­tinue dur­ing this pan­demic in sup­port­ing the ship­ment of crit­i­cal med­i­cal sup­plies, and we ex­pect it to pre­vail for ship­ments of the SarsCoV-2 vac­cines when they are ready for dis­tri­bu­tion also,” said the spokesman.</p>
    <p>Sars-CoV-2 is the coro­n­avirus that causes Covid-19.</p>
    <p>The $16.5 mil­lion Sats Cool­port has 18 cold rooms and four tem­per­a­ture zones which can store flow­ers, fruits, meats and medicine.</p>
    <p>Ground ser­vice provider dnata Sin­ga­pore also has a tem­per­a­ture­con­trolled per­ish­able han­dling cen­tre nearby, Coolchain, which opened in 2013.</p>
    <p>Last week, dnata launched cool dol­lies – high-tech con­tain­ers that fea­ture a closed tem­per­a­ture-con­trolled sys­tem.</p>
    <p>This will al­low tem­per­a­ture-sen­si­tive phar­ma­ceu­ti­cal goods to be trans­ported be­tween cargo ware­houses and air­craft, said dnata in a state­ment.</p>
    <p>Mr Lim Ching Kiat, man­ag­ing direc­tor of air hub devel­op­ment at Changi Air­port Group, said the cool dolly ser­vices fur­ther en­hance Sin­ga­pore’s sta­tus as a re­li­able and qual­ity air hub for phar­ma­ceu­ti­cal prod­ucts and per­ish­ables.</p>
    <p>“To­gether with our com­mu­nity, we are pre­par­ing for the ef­fec­tive global air trans­porta­tion of Covid-19 vac­cines,” said Mr Lim.</p>
    <p>Vac­cines are bi­o­log­i­cal prod­ucts that can de­grade rapidly with heat, which is why they re­quire a cold chain for ship­ment, said Pro­fes­sor Ooi Eng Eong, deputy direc­tor of Duke-NUS Med­i­cal School’s emerg­ing in­fec­tious diseases pro­gramme.</p>
    <p>A cold chain is a se­ries of links in the trans­porta­tion net­work that en­sures vac­cines are kept within the tem­per­a­ture ranges in which each one was tested for sta­bil­ity, said Prof Ooi, who is work­ing with Amer­i­can biotech­nol­ogy firm Arc­turus Ther­a­peu­tics to de­velop a Covid-19 vac­cine which is un­der­go­ing clin­i­cal tri­als in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>Links in a cold chain could in­clude en­sur­ing re­frig­er­a­tion in stor­age in ware­houses, for ex­am­ple, and on board freighters.</p>
    <p>Last month, lo­gis­tics firm DHL re­leased a re­port on the chal­lenges of trans­port­ing Covid-19 vac­cines, not­ing that cer­tain vac­cines would likely need to ad­here to a strin­gent tem­per­a­ture re­quire­ment of up to mi­nus 80 deg C dur­ing trans­porta­tion and warehousin­g.</p>
    <p>Ex­ist­ing vac­cines are con­ven­tion­ally dis­trib­uted at be­tween 2 deg C and 8 deg C, DHL noted.</p>
    <p>The dif­fer­ence in lo­gis­ti­cal re­quire­ments boils down to the types of Covid-19 vac­cines cur­rently in devel­op­ment around the world, in­clud­ing some that are based on new or ex­per­i­men­tal plat­forms.</p>
    <p>Dif­fer­ent plat­forms will likely come with dif­fer­ent tem­per­a­ture re­quire­ments for trans­porta­tion and stor­age, DHL said.</p>
    <p>For ex­am­ple, the vac­cine co-de­vel­oped by Duke-NUS and Arc­turus lever­ages an mRNA plat­form, a new type of vac­cine that has never been li­censed for hu­man use.</p>
    <p>Prof Ooi said the tem­per­a­ture ranges in which vac­cines can be stored or trans­ported de­pends on their preparatio­n.</p>
    <p>“Liq­uid forms gen­er­ally will need to be kept frozen un­til they are ready for use,” said Prof Ooi.</p>
    <p>But vac­cines can also be freezedrie­d, which would make them more sta­ble and amenable for trans­porta­tion un­der re­frig­er­ated con­di­tions, he added.</p>
    <p>Ear­lier this month, The Straits Times re­ported that Arc­turus is look­ing at a lyophilise­d or freezedrie­d ver­sion of the mRNA vac­cine that could work well at room tem­per­a­ture.</p>
    <p>Arc­turus pres­i­dent and chief ex­ec­u­tive Joseph Payne said hav­ing a suc­cess­ful lyophilise­d prod­uct, which is a pow­dered ver­sion that needs to be re­con­sti­tuted on site, re­moves the need for spe­cial ul­tra­cold freez­ers, which are costly and un­com­mon.</p>
