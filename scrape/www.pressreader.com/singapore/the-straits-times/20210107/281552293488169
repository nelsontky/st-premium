    <p>NewOcean 6, a bunker tanker at the cen­tre of Sin­ga­pore’s lat­est Covid-19 clus­ter, has been quar­an­tined and will cease all op­er­a­tions un­til fur­ther no­tice. The ves­sel will need to re­view all its pro­ce­dures be­fore it is al­lowed to re­sume op­er­a­tions, the Mar­itime and Port Au­thor­ity of Sin­ga­pore said in a state­ment yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The Mar­itime and Port Au­thor­ity of Sin­ga­pore said the for­eign crew mem­bers on board the bunker tanker did not dis­em­bark prior to be­ing tested pos­i­tive. It added that the Sin­ga­pore crew mem­ber is a cargo of­fi­cer who cer­ti­fies bunker delivery on board the ves­sel.</p>
    <p>NewOcean 6, a bunker tanker at the cen­tre of Sin­ga­pore’s lat­est Covid-19 clus­ter, has been quar­an­tined and will cease all op­er­a­tions un­til fur­ther no­tice.</p>
    <p>The ves­sel, which is op­er­ated by Palm­stone Tankers & Trad­ing, will need to re­view all its pro­ce­dures be­fore it is al­lowed to re­sume op­er­a­tions, the Mar­itime and Port Au­thor­ity of Sin­ga­pore (MPA) said in a state­ment yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Bunker tankers are a type of har­bour craft that op­er­ate in the Port of Sin­ga­pore and pro­vide es­sen­tial ma­rine ser­vices such as re­fu­elling ships that call at the port.</p>
    <p>On Tues­day, the Min­istry of Health (MOH) said nine cases were linked to the clus­ter.</p>
    <p>Among the nine is an In­done­sian crew mem­ber who was the first pa­tient to be con­firmed. He tested pos­i­tive on Dec 30. He ex­pe­ri­enced the on­set of symp­toms on Dec 23.</p>
    <p>The 47-year-old work per­mit holder ar­rived in Sin­ga­pore on Dec 17, af­ter go­ing through a 14-day quar­an­tine in In­done­sia, as per MPA reg­u­la­tions.</p>
    <p>The rules re­quire crew mem­bers, who ar­rive from overseas to work on board har­bour craft, to test neg­a­tive for Covid-19 at the start and end of their 14-day quar­an­tine pe­riod in their home coun­try.</p>
    <p>Upon ar­rival in Sin­ga­pore, they are tested again and will need to self-iso­late in a room un­til their test re­sults are known, be­fore board­ing the har­bour craft.</p>
    <p>The man tested neg­a­tive thrice – on Dec 1, 16 and 17.</p>
    <p>He started work on NewOcean 6 af­ter his test re­sult on Dec 17 came back neg­a­tive, said MPA.</p>
    <p>Fol­low­ing his pos­i­tive test on Dec 30, 13 re­main­ing crew mem­bers were quar­an­tined from Dec 31.</p>
    <p>Of them, eight – seven In­done­sians and a Sin­ga­porean – were sub­se­quently re­ported to be in­fected with Covid-19. One was re­ported on Sun­day, an­other on Mon­day, and the re­main­ing six on Tues­day.</p>
    <p>MPA said the for­eign crew mem­bers on board the bunker tanker did not dis­em­bark prior to be­ing tested pos­i­tive. It added that the Sin­ga­pore crew mem­ber is a cargo of­fi­cer who cer­ti­fies bunker delivery on board the ves­sel.</p>
    <p>On Tues­day, MOH said the Sin­ga­porean man was on board NewOcean 6 from Dec 21 to 23, and from Dec 28 to Jan 2, and that he was at his home in Tah Ching Road be­tween Dec 23 and 28. The 55-year-old’s ear­lier tests from ros­tered rou­tine test­ing – with the last one on Dec 23 – were neg­a­tive for Covid-19.</p>
    <p>He was taken to a gov­ern­ment quar­an­tine fa­cil­ity last Satur­day and tested pos­i­tive the next day.</p>
    <p>His sero­log­i­cal test re­sult has come back neg­a­tive, in­di­cat­ing a likely cur­rent in­fec­tion.</p>
