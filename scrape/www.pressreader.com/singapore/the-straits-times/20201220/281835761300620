    <p>A new $4 mil­lion re­lief fund has been launched to help Sin­ga­porean house­holds af­fected by the coro­n­avirus pan­demic.</p>
    <p>It aims to as­sist up to 8,000 house­holds, with each re­ceiv­ing a one-time re­lief of $500.</p>
    <p>The fund was jointly launched by the five com­mu­nity de­vel­op­ment coun­cils (CDCs) and the Kong Meng San Phor Kark See Monastery (KMSPKS) in a cer­e­mony at the monastery yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The tem­ple has do­nated $2 mil­lion, the largest sum given by a re­li­gious in­sti­tu­tion for a Covid-19 ini­tia­tive, and the amount is be­ing matched by the CDCs.</p>
    <p>It will iden­tify the ben­e­fi­cia­ries of the fund along with part­ners such as grass­roots or­gan­i­sa­tions.</p>
    <p>The fund is open only to Sin­ga­pore­ans aged 21 and above who are un­em­ployed and have had a to­tal loss of in­come due to non-vol­un­tary no-pay leave, re­trench­ment or ter­mi­na­tion of em­ploy­ment for at least three months at the point of ap­pli­ca­tion.</p>
    <p>Ap­pli­cants should not be from house­holds al­ready re­ceiv­ing other CDC-re­lated Covid-19 re­lief monies to en­sure more house­holds can ben­e­fit from this fund, the CDCs added in a state­ment.</p>
    <p>Speak­ing at the launch of the fund yes­ter­day, Min­is­ter for Social and Fam­ily De­vel­op­ment Masa­gos Zulk­i­fli said it com­ple­ments the var­i­ous av­enues of sup­port for house­holds fi­nan­cially hit by the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>The CDCs have been steadily ral­ly­ing the com­mu­nity, rolling out over 100 Covid-19 ini­tia­tives to date and help­ing more than 670,000 ben­e­fi­cia­ries over the last nine months, he added.</p>
    <p>“Let us con­tinue to put Sin­ga­pore­ans at the cen­tre of ev­ery­thing we do, es­pe­cially dur­ing this cri­sis. It is the lit­tle vic­to­ries and cel­e­bra­tions, like phase three, that are tes­ta­ment to the good work that we put in to­gether – lead­ers, cit­i­zens, ev­ery­body,” Mr Masa­gos said.</p>
    <p>The monastery’s ab­bot, Ven­er­a­ble Kwang Sheng, said: “We hope this new fund can bring heal­ing to the hearts and minds of those dras­ti­cally af­fected by the pan­demic.”</p>
    <p>Ms Low Yen Ling, chair­man of the may­ors’ com­mit­tee and Mayor of South West Dis­trict, said: “Or­gan­i­sa­tions like KMSPKS play an in­te­gral role in strength­en­ing the re­silience of our com­mu­nity. To­gether, we help en­sure no one is left be­hind and that those who need help can get the sup­port and at­ten­tion they need.”</p>
    <p>We hope this new fund can bring heal­ing to the hearts and minds of those dras­ti­cally af­fected by the pan­demic.</p>
