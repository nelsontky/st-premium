    <p>SAO PAOLO • Out­rage erupted in Brazil on Tues­day over video footage of a rape trial where the de­fen­dant’s at­tor­ney ver­bally at­tacked and hu­mil­i­ated the al­leged vic­tim, leaving her in tears and beg­ging the judge to in­ter­vene.</p>
    <p>Ms Mar­i­ana Fer­rer, a 23-year-old event pro­moter, ac­cused wealthy busi­ness­man An­dre Aranha, 42, of rap­ing her dur­ing a party she was hired to pro­mote in 2018 in the trendy beach re­sort of Flo­ri­a­nop­o­lis in south­ern Brazil.</p>
    <p>She says she was drugged be­fore the as­sault hap­pened.</p>
    <p>Mr Aranha hired high-pro­file de­fence at­tor­ney Gas­ton da Rosa Filho, who vir­u­lently at­tacked Ms Fer­rer’s cred­i­bil­ity dur­ing the trial.</p>
    <p>Mr Filho ag­gres­sively ques­tioned Ms Fer­rer over sen­sual photos she had posted on­line and told her, “I pray to God my son never meets a woman like you”.</p>
    <p>He called he rape al­le­ga­tion a “lit­tle show” and ac­cused her of us­ing it for fi­nan­cial gain.</p>
    <p>“It’s no use to fake cry. Get your croc­o­dile tears out of here,” he said after she broke down at the trial, held by re­mote video link ear­lier this year.</p>
    <p>The episode left a shaken Ms Fer­rer beg­ging Judge Rud­son Mar­cos to in­ter­vene.</p>
    <p>“Please, your hon­our, even de­fen­dants, even mur­der­ers, aren’t treated the way I’m be­ing treated,” she said through sobs.</p>
    <p>Mr Aranha was ac­quit­ted after Mr Filho suc­cess­fully ar­gued his client had at worst com­mit­ted “cul­pa­ble rape” – in other words, that he did not re­alise Ms Fer­rer was un­able to con­sent, ac­cord­ing to news site The In­ter­cept Brazil.</p>
    <p>But back­lash broke out when the site pub­lished ex­cerpts of the trial video.</p>
    <p>The Na­tional Jus­tice Coun­cil , a ju­di­cial over­sight body, an­nounced an in­ves­ti­ga­tion into Judge Mar­cos’s con­duct. The hash­tag #Jus­tice­forMar­iFer­rer was mean­while a top trend­ing topic on Twitter.</p>
    <p>“The scenes from Mar­i­ana Fer­rer’s trial are ap­palling. The jus­tice sys­tem should be a place of refuge, not of tor­ture and hu­mil­i­a­tion,” tweeted Brazil Supreme Court Jus­tice Gil­mar Men­des.</p>
