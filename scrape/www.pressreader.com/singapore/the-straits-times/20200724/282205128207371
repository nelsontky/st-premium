    <p>OR­LANDO (Florida) • Los An­ge­les Clip­pers star Kawhi Leonard was the first player on the floor on Wed­nes­day, lin­ing up for the Na­tional Bas­ket­ball As­so­ci­a­tion’s (NBA) first jump ball in more than four months – with­out wait­ing for the an­nouncer to be­gin in­tro­duc­ing the start­ing line-ups.</p>
    <p>The im­pro­vi­sa­tion was one of many as­pects of the NBA’s re­turn that could be clas­si­fied as un­tra­di­tional. With no fans to be found in the stands, hockey-style plex­i­glass en­cas­ing the scorer’s ta­ble and the Or­lando Magic op­er­at­ing as the vis­it­ing team j ust kilo­me­tres from their home arena, the Clip­pers posted a 99-90 vic­tory in a game that was pre­dictably scruffy.</p>
    <p>The game also did not count, but it was a sig­nif­i­cant oc­ca­sion none­the­less. It was the first time two NBA teams had shared the same floor since the abrupt sus­pen­sion of the sea­son on March 11 af­ter Utah Jazz cen­tre Rudy Gobert tested pos­i­tive for the coro­n­avirus.</p>
    <p>Af­ter months of ne­go­ti­a­tions, prepa­ra­tions and de­bate about the fea­si­bil­ity of re­sum­ing and sus­tain­ing an in­door con­tact sport dur­ing a pan­demic, the league took what it re­gards as a sig­nif­i­cant step in its come­back by hold­ing four ex­hi­bi­tion games, 15 days af­ter teams be­gan ar­riv­ing at the ESPN Wide World of Sports cam­pus.</p>
    <p>Twenty-two teams were in­vited to live, prac­tise and play in a so­called bub­ble with greatly re­stricted ac­cess at the Dis­ney World re­sort near Or­lando, Florida, to try to com­plete a sea­son some within the league ini­tially feared could not be sal­vaged.</p>
    <p>Each team will take part in three of these games be­fore the New Or­leans Pel­i­cans face the Jazz on Thurs­day to be­gin an 88-game sched­ule lead­ing into the play-offs.</p>
    <p>Wed­nes­day was a test run for the NBA as much as for the play­ers in what many re­gard as the most am­bi­tious un­der­tak­ing in the league’s his­tory.</p>
    <p>“Once you get in be­tween the lines, you can make a case that that’s prob­a­bly as com­fort­able as the play­ers will ever be,” Clip­pers coach Doc Rivers said. “You can see the rust and all that, but for them, they were back in their nat­u­ral habi­tat.”</p>
    <p>Quirks were plen­ti­ful i n the NBA’s re­turn, with 10-minute quar­ters in­stead of the usual 12, bursts of quiet dur­ing free throws, and syn­the­sised arena sounds piped in to fill the noise void.</p>
    <p>“There’s no crowd en­ergy, so the en­ergy is go­ing to have to come from the play­ers,” said Clip­pers cen­tre Joakim Noah.</p>
    <p>About 200 peo­ple were in at­ten­dance, in­clud­ing both teams, game oper­a­tions per­son­nel, league rep­re­sen­ta­tives, three hu­man cam­era op­er­a­tors to com­ple­ment an ar­ray of cam­eras and the small con­tin­gent of re­porters per­mit­ted to watch.</p>
    <p>Video boards are plen­ti­ful on the three sides of the arena vis­i­ble to a tele­vi­sion au­di­ence, most no­tably be­hind both bas­kets.</p>
    <p>Team benches have been re­placed by three rows of so­cially dis­tanced chairs on ris­ers – with spe­cific seat­ing as­sign­ments for each player. Seats at the scorer’s ta­ble, be­tween the two benches and in­side the plex­i­glass, are also spaced out to en­cour­age so­cial dis­tanc­ing, as they are in the press sec­tion for re­porters.</p>
    <p>“It feels like the sea­son again,” Wash­ing­ton guard Ish Smith said.</p>
    <p>“I think guys are now get­ting into a flow and know­ing this is the real thing.”</p>
