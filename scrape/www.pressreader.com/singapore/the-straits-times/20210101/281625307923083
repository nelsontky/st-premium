    <p>•</p>
    <p>LON­DON/CALAIS Bri­tain ex­ited the Euro­pean Union’s or­bit yes­ter­day, turn­ing its back on a tem­pes­tu­ous 48-year li­ai­son with the Euro­pean project for an un­cer­tain Brexit fu­ture that will shape the for­tunes of its peo­ple for gen­er­a­tions to come.</p>
    <p>Brexit, in essence, takes place at the stroke of mid­night in Brus­sels, or 11pm Lon­don time (7am to­day Sin­ga­pore time), when Bri­tain leaves de facto mem­ber­ship that con­tin­ued af­ter it for­mally left the bloc on Jan 31.</p>
    <p>For five years, the fren­zied gy­ra­tions of the Brexit cri­sis have dom­i­nated Euro­pean af­fairs, haunted the ster­ling mar­kets and tar­nished Bri­tain’s rep­u­ta­tion as a con­fi­dent pil­lar of West­ern eco­nomic and po­lit­i­cal sta­bil­ity.</p>
    <p>Cast by sup­port­ers as the dawn of a newly in­de­pen­dent “global Bri­tain”, Brexit has weak­ened the bonds that bind to­gether Eng­land, Wales, Scot­land and North­ern Ire­land into a US$3 tril­lion (S$4 tril­lion) econ­omy.</p>
    <p>“Brexit is not an end but a be­gin­ning,” Prime Min­is­ter Boris Johnson told Par­lia­ment just hours be­fore it ap­proved his EU trade deal.</p>
    <p>Grin­ning, he later quipped to re­porters that he had read the deal he had signed.</p>
    <p>Mr Johnson said there would be no bon­fire of reg­u­la­tion to build a “bar­gain base­ment Dick­en­sian Bri­tain”, and as­sured Europe that Bri­tain would re­main the “quin­tes­sen­tial Euro­pean civil­i­sa­tion”.</p>
    <p>But the face of the Brexit cam­paign has been short on de­tail of what he wants to build with Bri­tain’s new “in­de­pen­dence” – or how to do it while bor­row­ing record amounts to pay for the Covid-19 cri­sis.</p>
    <p>Leav­ing was once the far­fetched dream of a mot­ley crew of “euroscep­tics” on the fringes of Bri­tish pol­i­tics: The coun­try joined in 1973 as “the sick man of Europe”, and two decades ago, Bri­tish lead­ers were ar­gu­ing about whether to join the euro.</p>
    <p>Mr Johnson said: “The UK es­tab­lish­ment had ba­si­cally lost its mojo, and we went into what was then the com­mon mar­ket, re­ally, for rea­sons of self-pro­tec­tion – we thought that was the best fu­ture for us, we couldn’t see another way for­ward.”</p>
    <p>Fast for­ward 48 years.</p>
    <p>“We see a global fu­ture for our­selves,” said Mr Johnson, who came to power in 2019.</p>
    <p>On the day Bri­tain makes its fi­nal break with the EU, the ports are clear of lorry back­ups, goods are mov­ing smoothly and gro­cery store shelves are well stocked.</p>
    <p>Even so, Bri­tish busi­nesses that rely on some £1.2 bil­lion (S$2 bil­lion) of prod­ucts cross­ing the border each day are tak­ing no chances.</p>
    <p>Com­pa­nies were al­ready stock­pil­ing goods and ex­plor­ing al­ter­na­tives to the crowded lorry-ferry route across the English Chan­nel when France un­ex­pect­edly closed its border for two days last week, cit­ing a fast-mov­ing out­break of Covid-19 in Bri­tain.</p>
    <p>The dis­rup­tions that en­sued, pro­duc­ing miles-long back­ups at the Port of Dover, served as a warn­ing shot for po­ten­tial chaos as the Brexit tran­si­tion pe­riod ends.</p>
    <p>With the New Year be­ing ush­ered in over a long week­end, con­cerns of an im­me­di­ate re­peat of last week’s spec­ta­cle have di­min­ished.</p>
    <p>The port and its users will have the chance to ease into the new re­al­ity of a Cus­toms regime at the for­merly open border. Mr Richard Bal­lan­tyne, who heads the Bri­tish Ports As­so­ci­a­tion, said: “It should be quiet for at least the first few days.”</p>
    <p>But French lorry driv­ers warned that red tape, new “smart bor­ders” that do not talk to one another and ill-pre­pared traders could cause border chaos.</p>
    <p>Disruption is in­evitable, said Mr Se­bastien Rivera, head of the Na­tional Fed­er­a­tion of Road Hauliers in the north­ern Hautsde-France re­gion, home to the port of Calais and Euro­tun­nel ter­mi­nal through which mil­lions of lor­ries pass each year.</p>
    <p>“If you lis­ten to the French and Bri­tish au­thor­i­ties, the talk is of smart bor­ders and full readi­ness, but that doesn’t stop us hav­ing doubts,” Mr Rivera told Reuters in the north­ern town of Ar­ras.</p>
    <p>“It will be a real headache. Some com­pa­nies will be ready, oth­ers won’t. It is a ma­jor change of habits that lies ahead.”</p>
    <p>He said it was in­evitable that not all busi­nesses would be ready to nav­i­gate the raft of pa­per­work, in­clud­ing Cus­toms and safety dec­la­ra­tions, and the IT sys­tems nec­es­sary to trade be­tween Bri­tain and the EU from to­day.</p>
