    <p>TRIB­UTE TO CHAD­WICK BOSE­MAN: Lupita Ny­ong’o has writ­ten a touch­ing trib­ute to her friend and Black Pan­ther (2018) co-star Chad­wick Bose­man, who died late last month of colon cancer, aged 43.</p>
    <p>Break­ing her si­lence on Bose­man’s death, the 37-year-old ac­tress wrote on In­sta­gram: “I am strug­gling to think and speak about my friend, Chad­wick Bose­man, in the past tense. It doesn’t make sense.”</p>
    <p>Ny­ong’o, who played his love in­ter­est Nakia in the ground­break­ing Marvel movie, posted a photo of Bose­man laugh­ing with her hand on his shoul­der.</p>
    <p>She said: “The news of his pass­ing is a punch to my gut every morn­ing. I am aware that we are all mor­tal, but you come across some peo­ple in life that pos­sess an im­mor­tal en­ergy, that seems like they have ex­isted be­fore, that are ex­actly where they are sup­posed to al­ways be... Chad­wick was one of those peo­ple.”</p>
    <p>The ac­tress re­called the mak­ing of Black Pan­ther.</p>
    <p>“I re­mem­ber be­ing struck by his quiet, pow­er­ful pres­ence. He had no airs about him, but there was a higher fre­quency that he seems to op­er­ate from.”</p>
    <p>Ny­ong’o, whose film cred­its in­clude 12 Years A Slave (2013) and Us (2019), praised Bose­man for set­ting “the bar high by work­ing with a gen­eros­ity of spirit, cre­at­ing an ego-free en­vi­ron­ment by sheer ex­am­ple, and he al­ways had a warm gaze and a strong em­brace to share”.</p>
    <p>She ended the post by say­ing: “We are all charged by his work as a re­sult, by his pres­ence in our lives. His power lives on and will re­ver­ber­ate for gen­er­a­tions to come.”</p>
    <p>She had ear­lier at­tended a memo­rial for Bose­man in Mal­ibu, Cal­i­for­nia, with other Black Pan­ther co-stars Michael B.</p>
    <p>Jor­dan and Win­ston Duke.</p>
