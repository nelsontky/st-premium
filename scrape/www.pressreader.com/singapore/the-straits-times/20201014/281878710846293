    <p>United States Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump re­turned to the cam­paign trail on Mon­day for the first time since he an­nounced his Covid-19 di­ag­no­sis, tout­ing his man­age­ment of the pan­demic as opin­ion polls showed him los­ing more ground to Demo­cratic ri­val Joe Biden.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump ar­rived at the out­door rally in San­ford, Florida, the first of six planned for this week, with­out a pro­tec­tive mask.</p>
    <p>He tossed out masks to thou­sands of sup­port­ers stand­ing shoul­der to shoul­der, most with­out pro­tec­tive face cov­er­ings, and re­peat­edly talked about his re­cov­ery from the coro­n­avirus.</p>
    <p>“I went through it now. They say I’m im­mune. I feel so pow­er­ful,” Mr Trump told the crowd dur­ing his hour-long re­marks.</p>
    <p>“I will kiss ev­ery­one in that au­di­ence, I will kiss the guys and the beau­ti­ful women, I will give you a big fat kiss.”</p>
    <p>Mr Trump’s re­turn to his sig­na­ture cam­paign ral­lies kicked off a three­week sprint to the Nov 3 elec­tion.</p>
    <p>He was ex­pected to travel to Penn­syl­va­nia yesterday night, visit Iowa to­day and go to North Carolina for an event to­mor­row af­ter­noon.</p>
    <p>The Repub­li­can Pres­i­dent, 74, is seek­ing to change the dy­nam­ics of a race that na­tional opin­ion polls and some key state polls show he is los­ing to Mr Biden, 77.</p>
    <p>The air­port rally in San­ford in­di­cated that Mr Trump had not re­shaped his cam­paign ap­proach or out­look since con­tract­ing the coro­n­avirus, which has in­fected more than 7.8 mil­lion peo­ple in the US, killed more than 214,000 and put mil­lions out of work.</p>
    <p>He told sup­port­ers that coro­n­avirus safety lock­downs had done great dam­age to the econ­omy and were too dras­tic. “It’s risky, but you gotta get out,” he told sup­port­ers, who chanted: “We love you.”</p>
    <p>Crit­ics have faulted Mr Trump for fail­ing to en­cour­age sup­port­ers at cam­paign events, and White House staff, to wear masks and abide by so­cial-dis­tanc­ing guide­lines.</p>
    <p>At least 11 close Trump aides have tested pos­i­tive for the virus.</p>
    <p>Top US in­fec­tious dis­ease ex­pert An­thony Fauci told CNN that Mr Trump’s planned cam­paign ral­lies this week threaten to ad­vance the spread of the coro­n­avirus.</p>
    <p>“Look at it purely in the con­text of pub­lic health,” Dr Fauci said.</p>
    <p>“We know that that is ask­ing for trou­ble when you do that. We’ve seen that when you have sit­u­a­tions of con­gre­gant set­tings where there are a lot of peo­ple with­out masks, the data speak for them­selves.”</p>
    <p>Asked about Dr Fauci’s re­marks about the ral­lies, Ms Court­ney Parella, a Trump cam­paign rep­re­sen­ta­tive, said, “We take strong pre­cau­tions for our cam­paign events. Ev­ery at­tendee has their tem­per­a­ture checked, is pro­vided a mask they’re in­structed to wear, and has ac­cess to plenty of hand sani­tiser. We also have signs at our events in­struct­ing at­ten­dees to wear their masks.”</p>
    <p>Mr Trump’s Florida rally came hours af­ter the White House said he had tested neg­a­tive for Covid-19 on con­sec­u­tive days and was not in­fec</p>
    <p>tious to oth­ers.</p>
    <p>They were the Pres­i­dent’s first neg­a­tive Covid-19 tests an­nounced by the White House since Mr Trump said on Oct 2 that he had con­tracted the virus.</p>
    <p>In a memo, White House doc­tor Sean Con­ley did not say when the tests were con­ducted but that they and other clin­i­cal and lab­o­ra­tory data “in­di­cate a lack of de­tectable vi­ral repli­ca­tion”.</p>
    <p>On Sun­day, Mr Trump’s as­ser­tion that he was now im­mune to the virus, made with­out ev­i­dence, drew a flag from Twit­ter for vi­o­lat­ing the so­cial me­dia plat­form’s rules about mis­lead­ing in­for­ma­tion re­lated to Covid-19.</p>
    <p>Sci­en­tific re­search has been in­con­clu­sive on how long peo­ple who have re­cov­ered from Covid-19 have an­ti­bod­ies and are pro­tected from a sec­ond in­fec­tion.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump has worked fu­ri­ously for months to shift pub­lic at­ten­tion away from the virus and his han­dling of the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>But his own ill­ness has put the spot­light squarely on his coro­n­avirus re­sponse dur­ing the clos­ing stretch of the race, with Mr Biden scal­ing up his at­tacks and reach­ing into states that nor­mally lean Repub­li­can.</p>
    <p>On Mon­day, Mr Biden made two cam­paign ap­pear­ances in Ohio, where he was once con­sid­ered a long shot but polls now show a tight race. Speak­ing in Cincin­nati, he crit­i­cised Mr Trump for play­ing down the coro­n­avirus threat and mocked the Pres­i­dent’s state­ments that he did not want to panic Amer­i­cans.</p>
    <p>“Trump is the one who pan­icked. His reck­less per­sonal con­duct since his di­ag­no­sis, as well, has been un­con­scionable. And the longer Don­ald Trump is pres­i­dent, the more reck­less he gets,” Mr Biden said.</p>
