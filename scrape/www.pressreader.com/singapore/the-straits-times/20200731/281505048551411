    <p>WASH­ING­TON • United States Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump yes­ter­day sug­gested de­lay­ing the 2020 pres­i­den­tial elec­tion, in which he is cur­rently lag­ging badly in the polls, cit­ing the coro­n­avirus and what he said would be “fraud­u­lent” vot­ing.</p>
    <p>“De­lay the elec­tion un­til peo­ple can prop­erly, se­curely and safely vote???” Mr Trump asked in a tweet. “With uni­ver­sal mail-in vot­ing (not ab­sen­tee vot­ing, which is good), 2020 will be the most in­ac­cu­rate & fraud­u­lent elec­tion in his­tory. It will be a great em­bar­rass­ment to the USA,” the tweet said.</p>
    <p>Only Congress can change the date of the elec­tion, which is set by law for Nov 3. With Democrats rul­ing the Lower House, that seems highly un­likely to hap­pen.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump has pre­vi­ously in­sisted that he sees no prob­lem go­ing ahead with the elec­tion, where he faces Demo­cratic chal­lenger Joe Bi­den.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump has bit­terly re­sisted Demo­cratic-led at­tempts to in­crease avail­abil­ity of mail-in vot­ing, say­ing that this will pro­mote fraud and that Amer­i­cans should line up at the polls as usual.</p>
    <p>The Pres­i­dent’s sus­tained at­tacks on mail vot­ing, com­bined with Demo­cratic ef­forts to en­cour­age more of their vot­ers to re­quest and sub­mit ab­sen­tee bal­lots by mail, have led to a sig­nif­i­cant Demo­cratic ad­van­tage in mail vot­ing.</p>
    <p>In April, the lib­eral can­di­date for a Wis­con­sin state supreme court race per­formed about 10 per­cent­age points bet­ter in bal­lots cast by mail than she did on elec­tion day, ac­cord­ing to a New York Times anal­y­sis of the re­turns.</p>
    <p>The Pres­i­dent’s op­po­nents say there is no ev­i­dence of mean­ing­ful fraud in US elec­tions and, rather, that more ef­fort is needed to im­prove the com­pli­cated lo­gis­tics of mail-in vot­ing.</p>
    <p>Democrats, in­clud­ing pre­sump­tive pres­i­den­tial nom­i­nee Bi­den, have al­ready be­gun prepa­ra­tions to pro­tect vot­ers and the elec­tion amid fears that Mr Trump will try to in­ter­fere with the Nov 3 elec­tion.</p>
    <p>“A sit­ting pres­i­dent is ped­dling lies and sug­gest­ing de­lay­ing the elec­tion to keep him­self in power,” said Demo­cratic Rep­re­sen­ta­tive Dan Kildee on Twit­ter.</p>
    <p>“Don’t let it hap­pen. Ev­ery Amer­i­can – Repub­li­can, in­de­pen­dent and Demo­crat – should be speak­ing out against this Pres­i­dent’s law­less­ness and com­plete dis­re­gard of the Con­sti­tu­tion.”</p>
