    <p>GENEVA • Re­searchers are mak­ing “good progress” in de­vel­op­ing vac­cines against Covid-19, with a hand­ful in late-stage tri­als, but their first use can­not be ex­pected un­til early next year, a World Health Or­gan­i­sa­tion (WHO) ex­pert said.</p>
    <p>WHO is work­ing hard to en­sure fair dis­tri­bu­tion of the vac­cines, but in the mean­time the key is to sup­press the spread of the coro­n­avirus, said Dr Mike Ryan, ex­ec­u­tive di­rec­tor of WHO’s emer­gen­cies pro­gramme, as daily new cases around the globe are at near-record lev­els.</p>
    <p>“We’re mak­ing good progress,” Dr Ryan said on Wed­nes­day, not­ing that sev­eral vac­cines were now in phase three tri­als and none had failed, so far, in terms of safety or abil­ity to gen­er­ate an im­mune re­sponse.</p>
    <p>“Real­is­ti­cally, it is go­ing to be the first part of next year be­fore we start see­ing peo­ple get­ting vac­ci­nated,” he told a pub­lic event on so­cial me­dia.</p>
    <p>WHO was work­ing to ex­pand ac­cess to po­ten­tial vac­cines and to help scale up pro­duc­tion ca­pac­ity, Dr Ryan said.</p>
    <p>“And we need to be fair about this, be­cause this is a global good. Vac­cines for this pan­demic are not for the wealthy, they are not for the poor, they are for every­body,” he said.</p>
    <p>The United States gov­ern­ment will pay US$1.95 bil­lion (S$2.7 bil­lion) to buy 100 mil­lion doses of a Covid-19 vac­cine be­ing de­vel­oped by Pfizer and Ger­man biotech BioNTech, if it proves safe and ef­fec­tive, the com­pa­nies said ear­lier on Wed­nes­day.</p>
    <p>Dr Ryan also cau­tioned schools to be care­ful about re­open­ing un­til com­mu­nity transmissi­on of Covid-19 is un­der con­trol.</p>
    <p>De­bate in the US over restart­ing ed­u­ca­tion has in­ten­si­fied, even as the pan­demic flares up in dozens of states.</p>
