    <p>SEOUL • Thou­sands of mem­bers of a Protes­tant church linked to a coro­n­avirus clus­ter in Seoul have been asked to quar­an­tine, the South Korean au­thor­i­ties said yes­ter­day, ac­cus­ing the group’s fire­brand con­ser­va­tive leader – who has re­port­edly tested pos­i­tive – of ob­struc­tion.</p>
    <p>The coun­try’s “trace, test and treat” ap­proach has been held up as a global model in how to curb the virus, but it is now bat­tling sev­eral clus­ters linked to reli­gious groups.</p>
    <p>Over the weekend, the cap­i­tal and neigh­bour­ing Gyeonggi prov­ince – be­tween them home to nearly half the pop­u­la­tion – banned all reli­gious gath­er­ings and urged res­i­dents to avoid un­nec­es­sary travel af­ter a burst of new cases sparked fears of a ma­jor sec­ond wave.</p>
    <p>South Korea re­ported 197 new in­fec­tions yes­ter­day, tak­ing its to­tal to 15,515, its fourth con­sec­u­tive day of triple-digit in­creases af­ter sev­eral weeks with num­bers gen­er­ally in the 30s and 40s. The death toll stands at 305.</p>
    <p>The largest cur­rent clus­ter is cen­tred on Sarang Jeil Church in Seoul, headed by Mr Jun Kwang-hun, a con­tro­ver­sial con­ser­va­tive pas­tor who is a lead­ing fig­ure in protests against Pres­i­dent Moon Jae-in.</p>
    <p>A to­tal of 315 cases linked to the church were con­firmed by the end of the weekend, of­fi­cials said yes­ter­day, and around 3,400 church mem­bers had been asked to quar­an­tine.</p>
    <p>Vice-Health Min­is­ter Kim Gan­glip said about one in six church mem­bers tested so far was pos­i­tive, “re­quir­ing rapid test­ing and iso­la­tion”. But a list of mem­bers pro­vided by the church was “in­ac­cu­rate”, he added, making the test­ing and iso­la­tion pro­ce­dure “very dif­fi­cult”.</p>
    <p>The Health and Wel­fare Min­istry and the Seoul city au­thor­i­ties have filed two sep­a­rate po­lice com­plaints against Mr Jun, ac­cus­ing him of de­lib­er­ately hin­der­ing ef­forts to con­tain the epi­demic.</p>
    <p>Mr Kim said if the rate of new in­fec­tions did not sta­bilise this week, the govern­ment would tighten dis­tanc­ing mea­sures, shut high-risk fa­cil­i­ties and ban in­door meet­ings of 50 peo­ple or more and out­door gath­er­ings of 100 or more.</p>
    <p>Mr Jun was among speak­ers who ad­dressed thou­sands of right-wing pro­test­ers who ral­lied against Mr Moon’s cen­tre-left govern­ment in the heart of Seoul at the weekend, de­spite calls to avoid large gath­er­ings.</p>
    <p>Mr Jun has tested pos­i­tive for the virus, said Yon­hap News Agency yes­ter­day. He claimed in an in­ter­view with a Chris­tian me­dia out­let that his church was a vic­tim of “virus terror”.</p>
