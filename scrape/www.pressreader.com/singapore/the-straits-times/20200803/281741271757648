    <p>Be­fore Dick­son Yeo went to the United States to spy for China – a charge he has since con­fessed to – he once tried to get a job in Sin­ga­pore that would give him ac­cess to sen­si­tive in­for­ma­tion.</p>
    <p>For­mer se­nior diplo­mat and trade ne­go­tia­tor Barry Desker said Yeo had “tried un­suc­cess­fully to se­cure em­ploy­ment in Sin­ga­pore gov­ern­ment agen­cies deal­ing with clas­si­fied is­sues”. He was not able to elab­o­rate for se­cu­rity rea­sons.</p>
    <p>“We should not dis­count the pos­si­bil­ity that he was act­ing at the be­hest of his han­dlers. For­tu­nately, Dick­son was not se­lected,” added Mr Desker, a dis­tin­guished fel­low at Nanyang Tech­no­log­i­cal Univer­sity’s S. Ra­jarat­nam School of In­ter­na­tional Stud­ies (RSIS).</p>
    <p>Mr Desker, who was Sin­ga­pore’s am­bas­sador to In­done­sia from 1986 to 1993, was one of sev­eral re­tired se­nior diplo­mats and aca­demics with a back­ground in in­ter­na­tional re­la­tions who spoke to The Straits Times to share their in­sights on the case of Yeo.</p>
    <p>The facts of the case paint a pic­ture of a text­book ex­am­ple of an es­pi­onage op­er­a­tion, the ex­perts said, adding that spy­ing is, af­ter all, a fact of in­ter­na­tional re­la­tions.</p>
    <p>Even cases of in­di­vid­u­als act­ing against one coun­try on be­half of an­other that is not their own are not un­com­mon, they added.</p>
    <p>But the schol­ars and for­mer am­bas­sadors noted that cases in­volv­ing Sin­ga­pore­ans are rare. They added that the in­ci­dent has stoked con­cerns over the rep­u­ta­tional dam­age Yeo may have caused to Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>Some also ap­peared un­fazed by the case and ac­cepted that be­ing a tar­get for spies is an oc­cu­pa­tional risk, given the na­ture of their work.</p>
    <p>Mr Kwa Chong Guan, a se­nior fel­low at RSIS who pre­vi­ously worked at the Min­istry of De­fence, de­scribed Yeo’s re­cruit­ment as “the rou­tine work of any in­tel­li­gence agency” and “noth­ing no­table or ex­cep­tional”.</p>
    <p>“It is not un­com­mon for in­tel­li­gence agen­cies to try to re­cruit other na­tion­als to work for them in third-party na­tions. It pro­vides rea­son­able de­ni­a­bil­ity of the op­er­a­tion if they are caught,” added Mr Kwa.</p>
    <p>But he said it is con­cern­ing how easy it is to re­cruit some­one for es­pi­onage op­er­a­tions. Mr Kwa said: “We cer­tainly hope not to hear of more Sin­ga­pore­ans be­ing caught in for­eign in­tel­li­gence op­er­a­tions, but have to be pre­pared for it.”</p>
    <p>WILL THE CASE HAVE AN IM­PACT ON BI­LAT­ERAL TIES?</p>
    <p>Based on the in­for­ma­tion he was try­ing to col­lect, Yeo was act­ing against US in­ter­ests, not Sin­ga­pore’s, ob­servers noted.</p>
    <p>The Min­istry of Home Af­fairs has also said that in­ves­ti­ga­tions into the case have not re­vealed any di­rect threat to Sin­ga­pore’s se­cu­rity.</p>
    <p>But Mr Vergh­ese Mathews, Sin­ga­pore’s for­mer non-res­i­dent high com­mis­sioner to Fiji, said Sin­ga­pore­ans should not dis­miss the case just be­cause no di­rect harm has been done to Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>“Since the case hit the head­lines, I have heard said, some­what dis­mis­sively, that Dick­son, a Sin­ga­porean scholar, had op­er­ated in the US and was es­sen­tially tar­get­ing US cit­i­zens with known ac­cess to sen­si­tive in­for­ma­tion. Al­most as if no real harm was done to Sin­ga­pore,” he said. “That, of course, is su­per­fi­cial ob­ser­va­tion and also does not de­tract from the pos­si­bil­ity that he may have also been tar­get­ing Sin­ga­pore stu­dents as well.”</p>
    <p>A re­tired am­bas­sador who re­quested not to be named said trust­build­ing be­tween Sin­ga­pore and its al­lies may now take longer be­cause of the sus­pi­cion that other Sin­ga­pore­ans could have been com­pro­mised as well. The for­mer diplo­mat, now a busi­ness­man whose work in­volves the Asean re­gion, added: “Our diplo­mats are not ex­cluded from this sus­pi­cion. Sin­ga­pore­ans go­ing overseas for univer­sity stud­ies, train­ing pro­grammes, in­tern­ships or ap­ply­ing for jobs will likely be sub­ject to greater scru­tiny now.”</p>
    <p>RSIS ex­ec­u­tive deputy chair­man Ong Keng Yong said he be­lieves Sin­ga­pore’s bi­lat­eral re­la­tions with the US and China will re­main in­tact. This is be­cause Sin­ga­pore’s re­la­tions with the US are “long­stand­ing and ro­bust”, while Sin­ga­pore’s bi­lat­eral co­op­er­a­tion with China is also well known, said Mr Ong, who was pre­vi­ously Sin­ga­pore’s high com­mis­sioner to In­dia and Malaysia.</p>
    <p>What peo­ple should be con­cerned about, how­ever, is the state of Sino-US re­la­tions and how cases like this could con­trib­ute to a wors­en­ing of ties.</p>
    <p>“The big­gest worry for me is the cur­rent tra­jec­tory of US-China re­la­tions. One ac­tion begets an­other,” said Mr Ong. “Sin­ga­pore and Asean need a sta­ble China-US re­la­tion­ship to main­tain peace and se­cu­rity in the re­gion and to en­able eco­nomic growth and na­tional de­vel­op­ment.”</p>
    <p>UN­SUC­CESS­FUL AT­TEMPT</p>
    <p>(He) tried un­suc­cess­fully to se­cure em­ploy­ment in Sin­ga­pore gov­ern­ment agen­cies deal­ing with clas­si­fied is­sues. We should not dis­count the pos­si­bil­ity that he was act­ing at the be­hest of his han­dlers. For­tu­nately, ’’</p>
    <p>Dick­son was not se­lected. MR BARRY DESKER, dis­tin­guished fel­low at NTU’s S. Ra­jarat­nam School of In­ter­na­tional Stud­ies and a for­mer diplo­mat.</p>
    <p>COULD S’PORE BE LA­BELLED A ‘THIRD CHINA’ ONCE MORE?</p>
    <p>The ob­servers that ST spoke to were con­cerned that cases such as this, and that of Dr Huang Jing, an aca­demic at the Lee Kuan Yew School of Pub­lic Pol­icy who was ex­pelled from Sin­ga­pore in 2017 for be­ing an agent of in­flu­ence for an­other coun­try, could re­vive talks about whether Sin­ga­pore is a “Third China”, af­ter Tai­wan.</p>
    <p>A re­tired am­bas­sador noted that Yeo’s ar­rest hap­pened at a time when US-China re­la­tions are in a “near com­bustible state”.</p>
    <p>He said the fact that Yeo is a Sin­ga­porean “may trig­ger and res­ur­rect an un­in­tended con­se­quence of Sin­ga­pore be­ing per­ceived as a Third China”.</p>
    <p>“The attendant cost will un­der­mine our gen­er­a­tions of ef­fort to project Sin­ga­pore as an independen­t, non-aligned and mul­tira­cial nation at the in­ter­na­tional and re­gional level,” added the for­mer diplo­mat, who has served in sev­eral post­ings in East Asia.</p>
    <p>Mr Mathews agreed with the sen­ti­ment, point­ing out that Sin­ga­pore’s first prime min­is­ter Lee Kuan Yew had pub­licly de­clared that Sin­ga­pore would be the last Asean coun­try to es­tab­lish diplo­matic re­la­tions with China.</p>
    <p>He said the late Mr Lee also em­pha­sised that Sin­ga­pore’s lead­ers did not want Chi­nese of­fi­cials to ad­dress them as “brethren”, and made it a point to speak English dur­ing his first of­fi­cial visit to Bei­jing.</p>
    <p>Mr Desker added that the Sin­ga­pore Gov­ern­ment has al­ways em­pha­sised that Sin­ga­pore acts in its own in­ter­est.</p>
    <p>“We are not a Third China and re­gard our­selves as part of South-east Asia. Dick­son’s ac­tions play into the hands of those who would scur­rilously claim that we are a pawn pre­pared to fur­ther China’s in­ter­ests,” he said.</p>
    <p>An­other re­cently re­tired se­nior diplo­mat who also pre­ferred to re­main anony­mous ex­pressed sim­i­lar con­cerns. He said that while a sin­gle case is un­likely to lead any ra­tio­nal per­son or for­eign gov­ern­ment to view Sin­ga­pore as a Third China, “we can­not dis­card the fact that emo­tions are eas­ily stirred”.</p>
    <p>He added: “We also need to bear in mind that although, as far as I know, those who mat­ter in sur­round­ing coun­tries have not made any re­marks con­cern­ing this is­sue, there is a dan­ger that it could well be used by cer­tain politi­cians to whip up anti-Sin­ga­pore sen­ti­ment and cause un­ease among seg­ments of their pop­u­la­tions.”</p>
    <p>HOW CAN PEO­PLE GUARD AGAINST BE­ING TAR­GETED?</p>
    <p>Any­one could be tar­geted for es­pi­onage and those with­out train­ing on how to spot such ef­forts could fall prey more eas­ily, the for­mer diplo­mats warned.</p>
    <p>The for­mer am­bas­sador who has served in East Asia said in­tel­li­gence gath­er­ing and counter-in­tel­li­gence op­er­a­tions are both in­te­gral parts of a coun­try’s na­tional se­cu­rity.</p>
    <p>He noted that there is “ro­bust en­force­ment of the Of­fi­cial Se­crets Act (OSA), par­tic­u­larly on pub­lic ser­vice of­fi­cers to safe­guard sen­si­tive, clas­si­fied and priv­i­leged in­for­ma­tion”.</p>
    <p>“Reg­u­lar se­cu­rity brief­ings, vet­ting and clas­si­fi­ca­tion of those of­fi­cers han­dling highly sen­si­tive in­for­ma­tion is a norm,” he said.</p>
    <p>But he also said the en­force­ment of the OSA “seems less strin­gent” on the gen­eral pub­lic, who, of course, do not rou­tinely re­ceive se­cu­rity aware­ness brief­ings.</p>
    <p>“While there is no in­di­ca­tion of ma­jor se­cu­rity breaches in re­cent times, the au­thor­i­ties should ad­dress th­ese draw­backs and reg­u­larly ed­u­cate the pub­lic to safe­guard and re­in­force the hard-won in­ter-racial har­mony and so­cial fab­ric unity,” he sug­gested.</p>
    <p>Mr Ong said tech­nol­ogy is a “dou­ble-edged sword” that has cre­ated the po­ten­tial for “un­prece­dented in­tru­sions” into peo­ple’s per­sonal and pro­fes­sional lives. He noted that so­cial me­dia is de­signed for le­git­i­mate pur­poses, but it has been mis­used. Cy­ber crim­i­nals have also used tech­nol­ogy to steal ideas, iden­ti­ties and money, he said.</p>
    <p>Mr Kwa said Yeo’s modus operandi, of set­ting up a fake con­sult­ing com­pany as a front to re­cruit in­for­mants and col­lect in­for­ma­tion, is a com­mon tac­tic among in­tel­li­gence agen­cies.</p>
    <p>He added that the process of col­lect­ing in­for­ma­tion for the pur­pose of es­pi­onage is in fact sim­i­lar to bona fide po­lit­i­cal risk con­sul­tancy or mar­ket re­search work.</p>
    <p>“The dif­fer­ence is that it would not be eth­i­cal or le­gal for a com­mer­cial agency to ask for con­fi­den­tial or se­cret in­for­ma­tion re­ceived as part of one’s job,” he said.</p>
    <p>A re­tired civil ser­vant with a back­ground in the for­eign ser­vice, who is now an aca­demic, said he does not know of any other cases in which a Sin­ga­porean acted on be­half of a coun­try other than Sin­ga­pore and at­tempted to gain ac­cess to clas­si­fied in­for­ma­tion in the US or any other coun­try.</p>
    <p>But he said that, in the con­text of US-China re­la­tions, Sin­ga­pore­ans could fall for strong ap­peals to eth­nic­ity, cul­ture and lan­guage to take one side against the other. Hence, Sin­ga­pore­ans must ex­er­cise cau­tion un­der such cir­cum­stances.</p>
    <p>To those who may find them­selves in Yeo’s po­si­tion, the for­mer civil ser­vant ad­vised: “If one is ap­proached ei­ther way, the most log­i­cal and sen­si­ble act would be to in­form the au­thor­i­ties of the mat­ter, post-haste.”</p>
    <p>Mr Mathews said Yeo him­self ap­peared to have had in­ad­e­quate in­tel­li­gence train­ing and “prob­a­bly had delu­sions of grandeur to play in the big league in the US”.</p>
    <p>Dr Tan Lian Choo, a se­nior con­sul­tant and trainer at the global lead­er­ship de­vel­op­ment and train­ing firm Po­ten­tial Project, de­scribed Yeo’s case as a “cau­tion­ary tale for all Sin­ga­pore­ans”.</p>
    <p>In­di­vid­u­als who are grossly dis­af­fected at their work­places, or who have fi­nan­cial dif­fi­cul­ties or ex­pen­sive tastes and habits like gam­bling that their in­comes can­not sup­port, are par­tic­u­larly vul­ner­a­ble to be­ing tar­geted, added Dr Tan, who re­tired from Sin­ga­pore’s for­eign ser­vice in 2015. Some of th­ese traits were tell-tale signs that Yeo used to iden­tify po­ten­tial tar­gets.</p>
    <p>“One’s ego is al­ways the in­ter­nal en­emy-at-large. Unchecked, this ego can be very detri­men­tal to one’s own well-be­ing as well as to his or her coun­try’s se­cu­rity or rep­u­ta­tion,” she said.</p>
    <p>“Sin­ga­pore­ans can train their own an­tenna – it al­ways helps to live and work eth­i­cally, check our mo­ti­va­tions for ac­cept­ing or agree­ing to any ac­tions or moves to be taken.”</p>
