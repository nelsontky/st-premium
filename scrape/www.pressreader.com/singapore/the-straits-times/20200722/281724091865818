    <p>Singapore’s big­gest dor­mi­tory for mi­grant work­ers has been de­clared free of the coro­n­avirus af­ter it had recorded one of the ear­li­est and largest clus­ters among dorms.</p>
    <p>Sungei Ten­gah Lodge was one of 69 more dorms of var­i­ous types cleared by the Min­istry of Man­power (MOM) as of yes­ter­day, bring­ing the to­tal num­ber cleared to 891.</p>
    <p>Around 247,000 work­ers either have re­cov­ered or were tested to be free of the virus – more than 75 per cent of the 323,000 people re­sid­ing in dorms.</p>
    <p>Some cleared work­ers are wait­ing to be moved to ap­pro­pri­ate ac­com­mo­da­tion be­fore they can re­sume work, the MOM said.</p>
    <p>Oth­ers will be able to start work once manda­tory pro­cesses to min­imise the risk of new in­fec­tions have been put in place.</p>
    <p>Sungei Ten­gah Lodge in Old Choa Chu Kang Road was on April 9 gazetted as an iso­la­tion area to curb the spread of the virus.</p>
    <p>Be­fore the clus­ter there was closed last Satur­day, it had 2,203 con­firmed cases, mak­ing it one of the largest clus­ters.</p>
    <p>The dorm was de­signed to house up to 25,000 work­ers in its 10 blocks but now has about 16,000 re­sid­ing there. All these work­ers can re­turn to their jobs im­me­di­ately if their em­ploy­ers have re­ceived of­fi­cial ap­proval.</p>
    <p>Three of the 69 more dorms cleared as of yes­ter­day were pur­pose-built dorms (PBDs), 59 were fac­tory-con­verted fa­cil­i­ties and seven were tem­po­rary quar­ters on con­struc­tion sites.</p>
    <p>Ad­di­tion­ally, 41 more blocks for hous­ing re­cov­ered work­ers in 11 PBDs were cleared. These in­cluded fully clear­ing the re­main­ing blocks</p>
    <p>Three of the 69 more dorms cleared as of yes­ter­day were pur­pose-built dorms, 59 were fac­tory-con­verted fa­cil­i­ties and seven were tem­po­rary quar­ters on con­struc­tion sites.</p>
    <p>in Tampines Dor­mi­tory, Cochrane Lodge 1 and 2, Changi Lodge 2 and Sungei Ten­gah Lodge.</p>
    <p>The in­ter-agency task force to ad­dress Covid-19 in the dorms is also pro­gres­sively car­ry­ing out “ad­di­tional de­con­tam­i­na­tion mea­sures” to let more re­cov­ered work­ers from blocks and dorms yet to be cleared to re­sume work safely and with­out com­pro­mis­ing pub­lic health.</p>
    <p>Em­ploy­ers will be able to check details of their work­ers’ sta­tus through the Safe@Work eSer­vice on the MOM web­site.</p>
