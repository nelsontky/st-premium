    <p>RACE 1 (1,600M)</p>
    <p>5 Re­gency Gem is a course-and­dis­tance win­ner. He rates strongly with the drop to Class 5.</p>
    <p>8 Amaz­ing Agility won well last start over 2,000m. He can show up again, de­spite the shorter trip.</p>
    <p>12 Blaz­ing Part­ners will be fin­ish­ing fast with the 7lb (3.18kg) claim from ap­pren­tice Jerry Chau.</p>
    <p>14 Golden Gen­eral slots in with next to no weight and will be aided by French ace Alexis Badel.</p>
    <p>RACE 2 (1,000M)</p>
    <p>12 Com­fort Life closed in nicely for third last start over this course and dis­tance. Al­fred Chan’s 7lb claim will come in handy.</p>
    <p>11 Sparkling Dol­phin is rac­ing well. He is prov­ing to be a handy straight-course gal­loper.</p>
    <p>4 United We Stand is ul­tra con­sis­tent, hav­ing placed in three runs this term. He should be there.</p>
    <p>14 All The Way turned his form around to grab sec­ond last start. He is a chance with bot­tom weight.</p>
    <p>RACE 3 (1,200M)</p>
    <p>4 Vec­tor has been mov­ing well in his work and his tri­als. From the good gate, he should get ev­ery pos­si­ble chance.</p>
    <p>3 Rhap­sody won well last time. But the wide gate and the ex­tra 9lb will not make things easy.</p>
    <p>7 Inno Leg­end clearly has abil­ity with Zac Pur­ton stick­ing aboard for the third time.</p>
    <p>8 Breeze Of Spring steps out for his new trainer Jimmy Ting. He is rac­ing well and is ready to score.</p>
    <p>RACE 4 (1,400M)</p>
    <p>7 Sun Sun Fa Fa has had two runs af­ter a lengthy spell and has shown sig­nif­i­cant im­prove­ment.</p>
    <p>3 Mighty Power is look­ing to snap a run of three top-three fin­ishes. He can be re­warded soon.</p>
    <p>4 So Awe­some is also look­ing to break through fol­low­ing three close plac­ings.</p>
    <p>1 Golden Four has to shoul­der top weight but is in ca­reer-best form with­out win­ning. He can make his pres­ence felt.</p>
    <p>RACE 5 (1,400M)</p>
    <p>3 He­laku Knight should rel­ish the ex­tra 200m. He is rac­ing well and this should give him ev­ery op­por­tu­nity to win.</p>
    <p>2 Care Free Prince is a speedy on­pace cus­tomer. He can find the front from Gate 2.</p>
    <p>9 Cheer­ful Days was a close fourth in his de­but. Pur­ton hops up now and he de­serves re­spect, es­pe­cially up in trip.</p>
    <p>10 Stun­ning Im­pact has abil­ity. He is bet­ter than his last-start sixth sug­gests. He can fig­ure with a cold ride from the rear.</p>
    <p>RACE 6 (1,600M) 2 Ever Laugh</p>
    <p>is a f our-time course-and-dis­tance win­ner who is mak­ing a wel­come re­turn to Class 4. Down in this grade, he gets the con­di­tions to suit.</p>
    <p>1 De­ci­sive Ac­tion is a Class 4 win­ner who is com­pet­i­tive on his day. He gets the strong book­ing of Pur­ton.</p>
    <p>6 Fam­ily Leader rarely runs a bad race, although the wide gate does not help his claims.</p>
    <p>11 Apex Top is look­ing for back-to­back wins. He just needs to han­dle the step-up to the mile.</p>
    <p>RACE 7 (1,400M)</p>
    <p>1 Fast Most Fu­ri­ous is the class run­ner. If he per­forms at his peak, he can win, es­pe­cially as a twotime Class 1 win­ner.</p>
    <p>4 Band Of Broth­ers is on an up­ward tra­jec­tory, fol­low­ing two com­pet­i­tive runs un­der this term.</p>
    <p>5 Star Shine can fin­ish strongly with a race run to suit. The book­ing of Joao Mor­eira en­hances his chances.</p>
    <p>3 Bud­dies can roll for­ward from the good gate. His last-start win bodes well for this con­test.</p>
    <p>RACE 8 (1,000M)</p>
    <p>12 Joy­ful For­tune is a tal­ent, hav­ing clocked a slick 55.07sec on de­but. He is clearly the one to beat.</p>
    <p>14 Sparkling Knight is an­other sprint­ing tal­ent. He landed a classy five-length suc­cess last term and was a close sec­ond last start.</p>
    <p>13 Kur­pany has abil­ity. His rat­ing should be­gin to rise.</p>
    <p>is next best.</p>
    <p>9 Fly­ing Ge­nius RACE 9 (1,400M)</p>
    <p>8 Noble Steed was nar­rowly caught by a head last start over this course and dis­tance. He re­news part­ner­ship with Pur­ton, who is two-from-two on the horse.</p>
    <p>12 Awe has the abil­ity. He should be ready to im­prove sec­ond-up this term.</p>
    <p>3 The Crown caught the eye on de­but. He ap­pears ready to take the next step in his ca­reer.</p>
    <p>2 In­vin­ci­ble Mis­sile is bet­ter than his record sug­gests. The good gate could spark nec­es­sary progress.</p>
    <p>RACE 10 (1,800M)</p>
    <p>9 En­trusted gets a wel­come stepup in trip, es­pe­cially as a win­ner of 2,000m at New­bury in Bri­tain.</p>
    <p>5 Vincy is still look­ing for his first Hong Kong win, af­ter 23 tries. But he has seven sec­onds.</p>
    <p>7 Su­per El­e­gance is de­serv­ing of a win, hav­ing fin­ished run­ner-up a re­mark­able six times from 18 at­tempts, with­out a win.</p>
    <p>4 Cin­quante Cinq fin­ished close in his first-up ef­fort. He just needs luck from the wide gate.</p>

        <p data-role="text">Fast Most Fu&#xAD;ri&#xAD;ous (blue and red cap) is the class run&#xAD;ner in to&#xAD;day&#x2019;s Race 7. If he per&#xAD;forms at his peak, he can win, es&#xAD;pe&#xAD;cially as a two-time Class 1 win&#xAD;ner.</p>
