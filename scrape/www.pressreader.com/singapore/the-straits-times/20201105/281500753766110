    <p>CLAIM­ING VIC­TORY</p>
    <p>The United States was left on a knife edge after an in­tense election with record voter turnout yielded no clear out­come, and hinges on the count­ing of a few hun­dred thou­sand bal­lots in a hand­ful of key states.</p>
    <p>Six key states re­mained un­de­clared at press time, past mid­night in Sin­ga­pore. Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump, whose showing sur­passed poll­sters’ fore­casts, was leading in Ge­or­gia, North Carolina and Penn­syl­va­nia. Demo­cratic Party chal­lenger Joe Bi­den was leading in Wis­con­sin, Michi­gan and Ne­vada. US net­works pro­jected Mr Bi­den as the vic­tor in Ari­zona but the Trump cam­paign in­sisted it would re­tain the state Mr Trump took in 2016.</p>
    <p>Wis­con­sin, Michi­gan and Penn­syl­va­nia still have tens of thou­sands – in Penn­syl­va­nia the num­ber is over 600,000 – of mail-in bal­lots left to count. While Michi­gan’s count could be known by this morn­ing in Asia, Ne­vada’s count may take sev­eral days, re­ports said. That is, if they are not also sub­jected to lit­i­ga­tion. In a state­ment while the count was still on ear­lier in the day, Pres­i­dent Trump al­leged fraud, say­ing: “We were get­ting ready to win this election. Frankly, we did win the election.</p>
    <p>“This is a fraud on the Amer­i­can public,” he said. “This is an em­bar­rass­ment to our coun­try.”</p>
    <p>The Pres­i­dent sug­gested he wants to see bal­lot count­ing stop in Penn­syl­va­nia and Ge­or­gia, leading to spec­u­la­tion that the Republican Party may take le­gal ac­tion to do that.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump’s com­ments came soon after a brief state­ment in Wilmington, Delaware, by his Demo­cratic Party chal­lenger Joe Bi­den, who, speak­ing at a big park­ing lot with the au­di­ence in their cars honk­ing in ap­pre­ci­a­tion, said: “We feel good about where we are. We re­ally do.</p>
    <p>“I’m here tonight to tell you we’re on track to win this election.</p>
    <p>This is a fraud on the Amer­i­can public.</p>
    <p>This is an em­bar­rass­ment to our coun­try. We were get­ting ready to win this election. Frankly, we did win this election.</p>
    <p>PRES­I­DENT DON­ALD TRUMP, com­plain­ing about on­go­ing vote count­ing after not­ing he holds leads in sev­eral states that have not been called in his favour.</p>
    <p>OP­TI­MISTIC ABOUT OUT­COME</p>
    <p>It’s not my place or Don­ald Trump’s place to de­clare who has won this election. That’s the de­ci­sion of the Amer­i­can peo­ple. But I’m op­ti­mistic about this out­come.</p>
    <p>MR JOE BI­DEN, pro­ject­ing op­ti­mism and call­ing for pa­tience.</p>
    <p>I’m op­ti­mistic about the out­come,” he said.</p>
    <p>“It may take a lit­tle longer,” he added. “As I’ve said all along, it’s not my place or Don­ald Trump’s place to de­clare who won this election. That’s the de­ci­sion of the Amer­i­can peo­ple.” He called Mr Trump’s claim of vic­tory and fraud al­le­ga­tions “out­ra­geous”.</p>
    <p>But with both can­di­dates need­ing more than one or two states to reach the win­ning num­ber of 270 Elec­toral Col­lege votes, the out­come of the election may not be known for another day or more.</p>
    <p>Most pre-election sur­veys had pre­dicted a land­slide for Mr Bi­den. In­stead, he finds him­self in a dog­fight, with the out­come un­clear. Ac­cord­ing to the lat­est As­so­ci­ated Press count, Mr Bi­den had 238 Elec­toral Col­lege votes in his bank, and the Pres­i­dent had 213.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump was leading in Ge­or­gia, Penn­syl­va­nia and North Carolina, and slightly be­hind Mr Bi­den in Michi­gan. Win­ning these four would put him over 270. But the mail-in bal­lots, es­pe­cially in Penn­syl­va­nia, favour Mr Bi­den.</p>
    <p>“Bi­den’s path to 270 is to win Ne­vada, Michi­gan and Wis­con­sin,” the Cook Po­lit­i­cal Re­port said in a Wed­nes­day morn­ing note. “Trump will need to win Ge­or­gia, North Carolina, Penn­syl­va­nia and Wis­con­sin.”</p>
    <p>Democrats re­main bullish on the three “Blue Wall” states of Penn­syl­va­nia, Michi­gan and Wis­con­sin, based on the fact that so many of their votes have come in early and are still be­ing counted.</p>
    <p>Demo­crat hopes to flip at least two Se­nate seats were dashed. Se­nate Ma­jor­ity Leader Mitch Mc­Connell was pro­jected to re­tain Ken­tucky, and Republican Sen­a­tor Lind­sey Gra­ham re­tained his seat in South Carolina.</p>
    <p>But the Democrats gained one Se­nate seat in Ari­zona when Mr Mark Kelly de­feated Republican Sen­a­tor Martha Mc­Sally.</p>
    <p>At the start of Tues­day night, Democrats were hope­ful that vic­tory for Mr Joe Bi­den in Florida would quickly and cleanly end Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump’s re-election cam­paign.</p>
    <p>That sce­nario van­ished when Mr Trump took Florida, un­ex­pect­edly surg­ing in states that poll­sters had rated as toss-ups.</p>
    <p>He pro­ceeded to rack up win after win in Ohio, Iowa and Texas, which gave him breath­ing room and closed off some – but not all – paths to Mr Bi­den win­ning the pres­i­dency.</p>
    <p>And as of Wed­nes­day morn­ing in the United States, nei­ther can­di­date had the 270 elec­toral votes needed for vic­tory, which also meant that ei­ther can­di­date could still win.</p>
    <p>The key to vic­tory lies in the same states that pro­pelled Mr Trump to the White House in 2016: Michi­gan, Penn­syl­va­nia and Wis­con­sin.</p>
    <p>Also in­stru­men­tal are Ari­zona and Ne­vada, where Mr Bi­den is leading Mr Trump, with more than 80 per cent of votes counted, and Ge­or­gia, where Mr Trump is ahead.</p>
    <p>If Mr Bi­den holds Ari­zona and Ne­vada, and wins Michi­gan and Wis­con­sin, he would have ex­actly 270 elec­toral votes, the bare min­i­mum needed for vic­tory.</p>
    <p>This sce­nario looks promis­ing on pa­per. Mr Bi­den is gain­ing ground with the votes that are be­ing counted later in Wis­con­sin and Michi­gan be­cause these votes are largely ab­sen­tee bal­lots from cities and their sur­round­ing ar­eas, a vote for­mat and ge­og­ra­phy that tend to</p>
    <p>favour the Democrats.</p>
    <p>In Wis­con­sin, ab­sen­tee bal­lots put Mr Bi­den ahead by 20,748 votes, with just two of the state’s nearly 3,700 precincts left to re­port their votes. About 3 per cent of the vote had yet to be counted on Wed­nes­day morn­ing, pri­mar­ily ab­sen­tee bal­lots in cities where Democrats were stronger.</p>
    <p>Demo­cratic Party of Wis­con­sin chair­man Ben Wik­ler wrote on Twitter: “Ab­sen­tee bal­lots are still be­ing tal­lied in Mil­wau­kee, Kenosha and other cities.</p>
    <p>“Based on ev­ery­thing we have seen, those bal­lots will de­ci­sively favour Bi­den. Green Bay hasn’t re­ported any re­sults yet. When all votes are counted, we are con­fi­dent</p>
    <p>that Joe Bi­den will win Wis­con­sin.”</p>
    <p>Mr Bi­den took a slen­der lead in Michi­gan mid-morn­ing on Wed­nes­day, with more than 300,000 votes left to be counted.</p>
    <p>These votes largely came from Wayne County, Michi­gan’s most pop­u­lous county, which leans heav­ily Demo­crat.</p>
    <p>Should he win those four states, he would not have to win Penn­syl­va­nia or Ge­or­gia.</p>
    <p>But his chances in Penn­syl­va­nia are not bad ei­ther, re­ported the New York Times. More than 1.4 mil­lion ab­sen­tee votes have yet to be counted, and Mr Bi­den has so far won the state’s ab­sen­tee votes by a large mar­gin of 78 per cent to 21 per cent, the Sec­re­tary of State’s of­fice</p>
    <p>said on Wed­nes­day morn­ing.</p>
    <p>If Mr Bi­den con­tin­ues that trend, it could be enough to over­come the 700,000 lead Mr Trump has so far.</p>
    <p>Some of Penn­syl­va­nia’s in-per­son votes have yet to be counted, but those come pri­mar­ily from Philadel­phia and its sub­urbs, which tra­di­tion­ally vote Demo­crat.</p>
    <p>For Mr Trump, hold­ing Ge­or­gia and North Carolina, and keep­ing any two from the blue wall of Michi­gan, Wis­con­sin and Penn­syl­va­nia would take him to 270 elec­toral votes.</p>
    <p>When will the re­sults in some of these swing states be known? Ari­zona and Ge­or­gia, build­ing blocks of Mr Bi­den’s and Mr Trump’s re­spec­tive paths to the</p>
    <p>pres­i­dency, are ex­pected to fin­ish count­ing on Wed­nes­day. They will likely be called later in the day.</p>
    <p>In Ne­vada, things are look­ing de­cent for Mr Bi­den, who has a slen­der lead there. The state’s election divi­sion an­nounced that the votes it had yet to count were mail-in bal­lots and pro­vi­sional bal­lots, good signs for Mr Bi­den, as mail-in bal­lots typ­i­cally lean blue.</p>
    <p>Polling site FiveThir­tyEight founder Nate Sil­ver tweeted: “So, what is left in Ne­vada is mail and pro­vi­sion­als. No more in-per­son votes. That is likely good news for Democrats, un­less the late ar­riv­ing mail bal­lots were much red­der than the early ar­riv­ing ones.”</p>
    <p>Ne­vada, how­ever, ac­cepts</p>
    <p>mail-in bal­lots that were post­marked by election day up till next Tues­day, which means that the fi­nal re­sult may take another week to be known.</p>
    <p>Penn­syl­va­nia is another state where re­sults will take more time to be known, com­pli­cated by the le­gal bat­tles be­tween the Repub­li­cans and the Democrats over vote count­ing.</p>
    <p>All eyes will be on Michi­gan and Wis­con­sin, which counted bal­lots through the night. Most of, if not all, the re­sults there should be known on Wed­nes­day, and with that, whether Mr Bi­den or Mr Trump is closer to the pres­i­dency.</p>
