    <p>Poli­cies put in place to main­tain re­li­gious har­mony need to be con­stantly re­viewed amid so­ci­etal changes like evolv­ing views as seen among younger Sin­ga­pore­ans, said for­mer Cab­i­net min­is­ter Yaa­cob Ibrahim yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>He also said that faith-based de­bates that arise from time to time – for ex­am­ple, on why cer­tain pro­fes­sions for­bid the wear­ing of tudung – can­not be swept un­der the car­pet but have to be man­aged in a way that does not com­pro­mise Sin­ga­pore’s na­tional in­ter­est.</p>
    <p>Pro­fes­sor Yaa­cob, who re­tired from pol­i­tics ear­lier this year, was a pan­el­list at a we­bi­nar on re­li­gious har­mony or­gan­ised by the Cen­tre for Live­able Cities and the In­sti­tute of Pol­icy Stud­ies.</p>
    <p>He out­lined three trends that could im­pact the ex­ist­ing state of re­li­gious har­mony in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>These in­clude the “chang­ing ori­en­ta­tion of younger Sin­ga­pore­ans” on defin­ing re­li­gious di­ver­sity.</p>
    <p>“From their per­spec­tive, ev­ery­one who pro­fesses a re­li­gious be­lief, no mat­ter how dif­fer­ent to those in the main­stream, must have a seat at the ta­ble,” said Prof Yaa­cob, who had helmed sev­eral min­istries, in­clud­ing com­mu­ni­ca­tions and in­for­ma­tion.</p>
    <p>The for­mer Min­is­ter-in-charge of Mus­lim Af­fairs also cited how seg­ments of the Sunni group – to which most Mus­lims in Sin­ga­pore be­long – op­pose the in­clu­sion of a “small but grow­ing num­ber” of Shi’ite Mus­lims.</p>
    <p>Fel­low pan­el­list Lily Kong, pres­i­dent of Sin­ga­pore Man­age­ment Univer­sity, noted that dif­fer­ent prac­tices of the same re­li­gion could lead to “di­ver­gent, di­vi­sive re­la­tions”.</p>
    <p>Point­ing to the in­creas­ing di­ver­sity of the In­dian Hindu pop­u­la­tion in Sin­ga­pore, she said it be­gan with pre­dom­i­nantly south­ern in­flu­ences since colo­nial times but is now, ow­ing to mi­gra­tion, en­coun­ter­ing dif­fer­ing north­ern tra­di­tions and prac­tices.</p>
    <p>The so­cial sci­ences pro­fes­sor also pin­pointed the chal­lenges posed by tech­no­log­i­cal change – a trend Prof Yaa­cob had also high­lighted.</p>
    <p>“We all have greater ex­po­sure to what is hap­pen­ing else­where. This means that even with­out trav­el­ling some­where else, there is the pos­si­bil­ity that we’ll im­port prac­tices from other con­texts into our en­vi­ron­ment,” she said.</p>
    <p>Prof Kong cited the emerg­ing phe­nom­e­non of “ha­lal-fi­ca­tion” in Malaysia and In­done­sia, as well as among the Mus­lims in China.</p>
    <p>Be­sides food, the ha­lal con­cept is be­ing ex­panded into daily-use items such as re­frig­er­a­tors, wash­ing ma­chines and even In­ter­net browsers, as well as places like laun­dro­mats and gated com­mu­ni­ties.</p>
    <p>Prof Yaa­cob cau­tioned that the spread of mis­in­for­ma­tion and the rise of “deep­fakes” could have “dev­as­tat­ing” con­se­quences for Sin­ga­pore’s re­li­gious har­mony.</p>
    <p>The panel­lists were also asked how the Govern­ment could bet­ter man­age is­sues like tudung-wear­ing for front-line of­fi­cers.</p>
    <p>In Au­gust, a woman was asked to re­move her tudung to work as a pro­moter at Tangs depart­ment store. The de­ci­sion was sub­se­quently re­versed.</p>
    <p>Prof Yaa­cob said such ef­forts typ­i­cally oc­cur be­hind the scenes, with re­li­gious com­mu­nity groups hav­ing con­tin­ual di­a­logue with the Govern­ment and pri­vate agen­cies.</p>
    <p>Giv­ing the ex­am­ple of a Malay nurse wear­ing a tudung, he said: “The lady wants to be a nurse but wants also to prac­tise her be­liefs. So how do you bal­ance the two in such a way… with­out un­der­min­ing what­ever con­cerns that we have in so­ci­ety?”</p>
    <p>Prof Yaa­cob, an engi­neer­ing pro­fes­sor at the Sin­ga­pore In­sti­tute of Tech­nol­ogy, later told The Straits Times that even though he has left pol­i­tics, peo­ple con­tinue to ask him about the tudung is­sue.</p>
    <p>“You need to ex­plore it… but in a man­ner that pre­serves the trust and un­der­stand­ing that the (Mus­lim) com­mu­nity has reached with the Govern­ment,” he said.</p>
