    <p>Brown patches ap­peared sud­denly on my roselle plant (above left) and, two days af­ter I took the pho­to­graph, its bud looked to be with­er­ing. What is wrong with the plant? It was grow­ing well un­til the brown patches ap­peared. Also, there seemed to be a waxy layer on the leaves of my kailan (above right). When I rubbed the leaves, the darker green tone ap­peared. Is that nor­mal?</p>
    <p>From the patches on the leaves of your roselle, it ap­pears that the plant may be suf­fer­ing from sun­burn. Was it grown un­der shadier con­di­tions or was it trans­planted and placed right away un­der the sun?</p>
    <p>Al­though it is a plant that prefers di­rect sun­light, the roselle, if grown un­der shadier con­di­tions for a pro­longed pe­riod, needs to be grad­u­ally ac­cli­ma­tised to more in­tense sun­light.</p>
    <p>A plant that has been trans­planted has to pro­duce roots to be able to ab­sorb mois­ture that it needs un­der sun­nier con­di­tions. It is of­ten rec­om­mended to put a re­cently trans­planted plant un­der cooler and slightly shadier con­di­tions for this process to take place.</p>
    <p>An­other pos­si­bil­ity is that a gar­den chem­i­cal had been sprayed on the leaves that caused the burn.</p>
    <p>Never spray oil-based pes­ti­cides dur­ing the hot­ter part of the day. It is best to test the pes­ti­cide on a small part of the plant be­fore spray­ing the en­tire plant with it – this en­sures the plant does not re­act ad­versely to the chem­i­cal.</p>
    <p>As for the whitish sur­face on the leaves of the kailan, that is the pro­tec­tive wax that can be seen on cer­tain cul­ti­vars of this leafy veg­etable. Plants grown un­der sun­nier con­di­tions will have a more ob­vi­ous layer of wax. It is nor­mal and the veg­etable is safe for con­sump­tion.</p>
