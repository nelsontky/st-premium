    <p>A weaker im­mune re­sponse in chil­dren may para­dox­i­cally in­di­cate that they van­quish the virus be­fore it has a chance to wreak havoc in the body, and may help ex­plain why chil­dren are mostly spared se­vere symp­toms of Covid-19. It may also show why they are less likely to spread the virus to oth­ers.</p>
    <p>NEW YORK • Chil­dren in­fected with the coro­n­avirus pro­duce weaker an­ti­bod­ies and fewer types of them than adults do, sug­gest­ing they clear their in­fec­tion much faster, ac­cord­ing to a new study pub­lished on Thurs­day.</p>
    <p>Other stud­ies have sug­gested that an overly strong im­mune re­sponse may be to blame in peo­ple who get se­verely ill or die from Covid-19.</p>
    <p>A weaker im­mune re­sponse in chil­dren may para­dox­i­cally in­di­cate that they van­quish the virus be­fore it has a chance to wreak havoc in the body, and may help ex­plain why chil­dren are mostly spared se­vere symp­toms of Covid-19. It may also show why they are less likely to spread the virus to oth­ers. “They may be in­fec­tious for a shorter time,” said Pro­fes­sor Donna Far­ber, an im­mu­nol­o­gist at Columbia Univer­sity in New York who led the study.</p>
    <p>Prof Far­ber and her col­leagues an­a­lysed an­ti­bod­ies to the coro­n­avirus in four groups of pa­tients: Nine­teen adult con­va­les­cent plasma donors who had re­cov­ered from Covid-19 with­out be­ing hos­pi­talised; 13 adults hos­pi­talised with acute res­pi­ra­tory dis­tress syn­drome re­sult­ing from se­vere Covid-19; 16 chil­dren hos­pi­talised with multi-sys­tem in­flam­ma­tory syn­drome, the rare con­di­tion af­fect­ing some in­fected chil­dren; and 31 in­fected chil­dren who did not have the syn­drome.</p>
    <p>In­di­vid­u­als in each group had an­ti­bod­ies, con­sis­tent with other stud­ies show­ing that most peo­ple in­fected with the coro­n­avirus mount a ro­bust im­mune re­sponse.</p>
    <p>But the range of an­ti­bod­ies dif­fered be­tween chil­dren and adults. The chil­dren made pri­mar­ily one type of an­ti­body, called IgG, that recog­nises the spike pro­tein on the sur­face of the virus.</p>
    <p>The adults made sev­eral types of an­ti­bod­ies to the spike and other vi­ral pro­teins, and these an­ti­bod­ies were more pow­er­ful at neu­tral­is­ing the virus.</p>
    <p>Chil­dren had “less of a pro­tec­tive re­sponse, but they also had less of a breadth of an an­ti­body re­sponse,” Prof Far­ber said. “It’s be­cause those kids are just not get­ting in­fected as se­verely.”</p>
    <p>Nei­ther group of chil­dren had an­ti­bod­ies to a vi­ral pro­tein called the nu­cle­o­cap­sid, or N, that is en­tan­gled with the ge­netic ma­te­rial of the virus. She said this sug­gests a “re­duced in­fec­tion course if these kids are get­ting in­fected”.</p>
    <p>The find­ing could un­der­mine the re­sults from tests de­signed to pick up an­ti­bod­ies to the N pro­tein. Many tests are spe­cific to the N an­ti­bod­ies and may miss chil­dren who have cleared the virus.</p>
    <p>But ex­perts urged cau­tion in in­ter­pret­ing the re­sults as they rep­re­sent sam­ples taken from peo­ple at a sin­gle point in time. The type of an­ti­bod­ies pro­duced by the body varies over the time course of an in­fec­tion.</p>
