    <p>PARIS • Women’s 400m Olympic cham­pion Shau­nae Miller-Uibo on Wed­nes­day crit­i­cised World Athletics (WA) after the dop­ing sus­pen­sion of her ri­val Salwa Eid Naser was over­turned.</p>
    <p>Naser, 22, was pro­vi­sion­ally sus­pended in June and charged with fail­ing to meet “where­abouts” cri­te­ria, but the de­ci­sion was over­turned on Tues­day by WA’s dis­ci­plinary tri­bunal.</p>
    <p>A tester had knocked on the wrong door, the re­port said, adding that the cir­cum­stances sur­round­ing one missed test “would have been com­i­cal were the con­se­quences not so se­ri­ous”.</p>
    <p>Bahrain’s Naser beat MillerUibo in last year’s world cham­pi­onships by clock­ing 48.14 sec­onds, the third-fastest time in his­tory. The Ba­hamian had to set­tle for her sec­ond world cham­pi­onship sil­ver and in a post on In­sta­gram, she lashed out at the de­ci­sion to al­low her ri­val to run.</p>
    <p>The world cham­pi­onships were held in Doha, Qatar from Septem­ber to Oc­to­ber. But be­tween Jan­uary and April of last year, Naser had thrice failed to ful­fil her where­abouts obli­ga­tions, ac­cord­ing to</p>
    <p>WA. Although the last of those fail­ures was deemed not her fault by the tri­bunal, Miller-Uibo, 26, ques­tioned the lack of ac­count­abil­ity.</p>
    <p>“Why was no ac­tion taken?” she said on In­sta­gram. “Why was the ath­lete not pro­vi­sion­ally sus­pended un­til one year and two months later? I cry foul play and be­lieve there is a deeper ex­pla­na­tion of how World Athletics... al­lowed this to carry on.</p>
    <p>“We need to en­sure that in athletics, we the ath­letes are not com­pet­ing against any ad­min­is­tra­tors, whose only goal is for ath­letes to run faster, jump fur­ther and throw fur­ther at any cost.”</p>
    <p>She later stated her be­lief that the World Anti-Dop­ing Agency would ap­peal the ver­dict to the Court of Ar­bi­tra­tion for Sport.</p>
    <p>A state­ment re­leased by WA said: “We un­der­stand that the time this process takes can be frus­trat­ing, but the sys­tem must be in­de­pen­dent, ro­bust and thor­ough in or­der to main­tain in­tegrity.”</p>
    <p>In re­sponse to Miller-Uibo’s queries, the Athletics In­tegrity Unit said: “The power to im­pose a pro­vi­sional sus­pen­sion in where­abouts cases only arises un­der the World Athletics rules once a charge is is­sued. Where­abouts cases of­ten in­volve com­plex fac­tual sce­nar­ios that re­quire in­ves­ti­ga­tion. Cases are gen­er­ally not con­cluded soon after the date of the third where­abouts fail­ure, but of­ten will only be fi­nalised months later.”</p>
