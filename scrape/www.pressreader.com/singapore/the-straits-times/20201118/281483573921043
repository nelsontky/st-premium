    <p>Thai­land’s riot po­lice yes­ter­day sprayed wa­ter can­non at pro-democ­racy ac­tivists ral­ly­ing near Par­lia­ment as law­mak­ers be­gan to discuss a road map for amend­ing the na­tion’s Con­sti­tu­tion. Pro­test­ers tried to breach con­crete bar­ri­cades and barbed wire placed out­side the Par­lia­ment build­ing in cen­tral Bangkok. In ad­di­tion to wa­ter can­non, tear gas was later used to dis­perse the thou­sands who had gath­ered. Demon­stra­tions have swept the coun­try since July, with pro­test­ers de­mand­ing fresh elec­tions un­der a new char­ter, the res­ig­na­tion of Prime Min­is­ter Prayut Chan-o-cha and re­form of the monar­chy.</p>
    <p>BANGKOK Thai po­lice fired wa­ter can­non and tear­gas at pro­test­ers march­ing on Par­lia­ment yes­ter­day, and at least 18 peo­ple were hurt in the most vi­o­lent con­fronta­tion since a youth-led protest move­ment emerged in July.</p>
    <p>Demon­stra­tors had con­verged on Par­lia­ment in cen­tral Bangkok to put pres­sure on law­mak­ers dis­cussing changes to the Con­sti­tu­tion. Pro­test­ers also want the re­moval of Prime Min­is­ter Prayut Chan-o-cha, a for­mer army ruler, and to curb the pow­ers of King Maha Va­ji­ra­longkorn.</p>
    <p>Po­lice used wa­ter can­non to dis­perse pro­test­ers who cut through ra­zor-wire bar­ri­cades and re­moved con­crete bar­ri­ers out­side Par­lia­ment. Of­fi­cers then fired tear­gas.</p>
    <p>Thou­sands of pro­test­ers gath­ered at dif­fer­ent points and the num­ber grew into the evening.</p>
    <p>Am­bu­lances fer­ried the in­jured to hos­pi­tal. Bangkok’s Erawan Med­i­cal Cen­tre said 18 peo­ple were hurt, 12 of them suffering as a re­sult of tear­gas. It said one of those hurt was a po­lice of­fi­cer.</p>
    <p>“This is bru­tal,” said a 31-yearold vol­un­teer with the Free Youth protest group who gave his name as Oh.</p>
    <p>Bangkok’s deputy head of po­lice Piya Tavichai told Reuters: “Po­lice had to use tear­gas and wa­ter can­non be­cause pro­test­ers were try­ing to break through the bar­ri­ers.”</p>
    <p>Gov­ern­ment spokesman Anucha Bu­ra­pachaisri said po­lice had been obliged to act to keep par­lia­men­tar­i­ans safe.</p>
    <p>The Royal Palace has made no com­ment since the protests be­gan, although the King re­cently de­scribed Thai­land as a “land of com­pro­mise” when asked about the protests.</p>
    <p>Law­mak­ers had be­gun dis­cus­sions on a road map for amend­ing the na­tion’s Con­sti­tu­tion yes­ter­day, with a vote on the path­way to any changes ex­pected by to­day.</p>
    <p>Par­lia­ment restarted the stalled process that is aimed at meet­ing one of the key de­mands of the pro­test­ers, who are seek­ing a fresh elec­tion un­der a new Con­sti­tu­tion.</p>
    <p>Anti-gov­ern­ment protests have swept Thai­land since July, with ac­tivists break­ing long-held taboos about pub­licly crit­i­cis­ing the royal fam­ily and ques­tion­ing laws that sti­fle dis­cus­sion of the monar­chy.</p>
    <p>While the youth-led demon­stra­tions have been largely peace­ful, they threaten to de­rail an eco­nomic re­cov­ery in the touris­mand trade-re­liant na­tion.</p>
    <p>Thai­land’s cur­rent char­ter has been a point of con­tention since its in­cep­tion af­ter Mr Prayut took power in a 2014 coup. Pro­test­ers and crit­ics viewed it as in­stru­men­tal in helping the roy­al­ist es­tab­lish­ment re­tain its grip on power with Mr Prayut re­turn­ing as the leader af­ter the 2019 elec­tions.</p>
    <p>The char­ter al­lows the mil­i­taryap­pointed Se­nate, whose pow­ers demon­stra­tors want scrapped, to vote for the premier.</p>
    <p>A panel ap­pointed by Par­lia­ment to study the char­ter amend­ments sub­mit­ted a report to the law­mak­ers yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>If Par­lia­ment ends up sup­port­ing a path­way to create a com­mit­tee to re­write the char­ter, the process of es­tab­lish­ing a panel alone could take three to six months, ac­cord­ing to Dr Pun­chada Sirivunna­bood, an as­so­ciate pro­fes­sor of pol­i­tics at Mahi­dol Univer­sity near Bangkok.</p>
    <p>How­ever, such a panel with­out rep­re­sen­ta­tives from the protest move­ment may not help re­solve</p>
    <p>any is­sues, she added.</p>
    <p>“What we would likely see at the end of the process is the es­tab­lish­ment still keep­ing the struc­ture that helps them keep the power,” Dr Pun­chada said. “There might be changes in elec­tion laws and Se­nate power, but those changes would still fa­cil­i­tate the es­tab­lish­ment-backed party in the elec­tions. There won’t be any changes to laws re­lated to the monar­chy.”</p>
    <p>Gov­ern­ment spokesman Mr Bu­ra­pachaisri had said on Mon­day the pro­test­ers’ de­mands should be ad­dressed by the par­lia­men­tary process, and that the gov­ern­ment is will­ing to lis­ten to all sug­ges­tions that could help Thai­land move past the cur­rent eco­nomic crisis.</p>
    <p>Ear­lier yes­ter­day, hun­dreds of mem­bers of a pro-roy­al­ist group called Thai Pakdee ral­lied out­side Par­lia­ment. They are against chang­ing the Con­sti­tu­tion and any di­lu­tion of monar­chy pow­ers.</p>
    <p>“Amend­ing the Con­sti­tu­tion is go­ing to lead to the abo­li­tion of the monar­chy,” their leader Warong Dechgitvi­grom told re­porters.</p>
    <p>How­ever, the pro­test­ers have said they do not want to abol­ish the monar­chy.</p>
