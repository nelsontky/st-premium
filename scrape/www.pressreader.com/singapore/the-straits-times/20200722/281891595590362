    <p>WASH­ING­TON • A US cou­ple who be­came In­ter­net i nfa­mous for draw­ing an as­sault ri­fle and a hand­gun on pro­test­ers out­side their Mis­souri man­sion have been charged with a felony.</p>
    <p>In a vi­ral video, Mark McCloskey and his wife Pa­tri­cia, both lawyers, are seen stand­ing bare­foot in their gar­den in St Louis, Mis­souri, on June 28 as anti-racism pro­test­ers march down a pri­vate street to demon­strate i n front of the mayor’s house.</p>
    <p>McCloskey, 63, car­ried an as­sault ri­fle, and his wife, 61, was wav­ing a hand­gun.</p>
    <p>“To­day, my of­fice filed charges against Mark and Pa­tri­cia McCloskey following an in­ci­dent in­volv­ing peace­ful, un­armed pro­test­ers on June 28th. It is il­le­gal to wave weapons in a threat­en­ing man­ner at those par­tic­i­pat­ing in non-vi­o­lent protest,” the at­tor­ney for St Louis, Ms Kim­berly Gard­ner, said in a state­ment on Mon­day.</p>
    <p>She said she was open to let­ting the cou­ple take part in one of the cir­cuit at­tor­ney of­fice’s di­ver­sion pro­grammes “de­signed to re­duce un­nec­es­sary in­volve­ment with the courts”, adding: “We must pro­tect the right to peace­fully protest and any at­tempt to chill it through in­tim­i­da­tion will not be tol­er­ated.”</p>
    <p>Mis­souri Gov­er­nor Mike Par­son, a Repub­li­can, told a ra­dio show last week he would likely par­don the McCloskeys if they were charged.</p>
    <p>The morn­ing af­ter the protest, McCloskey told a local news chan­nel he and his family were “ter­ri­fied” when the pro­test­ers ar­rived, call­ing the march a “mob”.</p>
    <p>US Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump retweeted with­out com­ment the video of the cou­ple point­ing the ri­fle and hand­gun at the pro­test­ers, the ma­jor­ity of whom were black.</p>
    <p>The clip sparked out­rage on­line, with Ms Gard­ner tweet­ing that she was “alarmed” to see “peace­ful pro­test­ers were met by guns and a vi­o­lent as­sault”.</p>
    <p>Faced with a grow­ing back­lash, con­gress­man and Trump ally Matt Gaetz came to the McCloskeys’ de­fence on Twitter, at­tempt­ing to paint the cou­ple as vic­tims of a dystopian future should Demo­cratic pres­i­den­tial nom­i­nee Joe Bi­den win the Novem­ber elec­tion.</p>
