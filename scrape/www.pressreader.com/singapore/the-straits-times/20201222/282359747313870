    <p>Sin­ga­pore Air­lines (SIA) has used ap­prox­i­mately $7.1 bil­lion of the $8.8 bil­lion raised from a rights is­sue in June, it said in a fil­ing to the Sin­ga­pore Ex­change yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Be­tween Oct 14 and Dec 13, the flag car­rier spent a fur­ther $900 mil­lion of the gross pro­ceeds from the rights is­sue. Of this amount, $500 mil­lion was used to fund on­go­ing op­er­at­ing ex­penses, $200 mil­lion went to­wards re­fund­ing tick­ets sold on flights that have been can­celled in view of con­tin­u­ing border con­trols and travel re­stric­tions, and $200 mil­lion was ap­plied to­wards debt ser­vic­ing.</p>
    <p>Its last up­date on the use of pro­ceeds from the rights is­sue was in mid-Oc­to­ber, when SIA said it had spent $1.8 bil­lion over about two months. The amount was used for on­go­ing op­er­at­ing ex­penses, ticket re­funds and debt ser­vic­ing.</p>
    <p>In ad­di­tion to the funds raised dur­ing the rights is­sue, SIA said it has raised for FY2020/21 a to­tal of $2.1 bil­lion through loans se­cured on its air­craft and a short-term un­se­cured loan, $850 mil­lion through a con­vert­ible bond is­sue, and $500 mil­lion via a pri­vate place­ment of new 10-year bonds.</p>
    <p>It has ac­cess to about $2.1 bil­lion of lines of credit avail­able for draw­ing, and has the op­tion to is­sue ad­di­tional manda­tory con­vert­ible bonds to raise up to $6.2 bil­lion if the cri­sis pro­longs.</p>
    <p>SIA shares closed at $4.38 yes­ter­day, down 1.13 per cent or five cents.</p>
    <p>SIA has ac­cess to about $2.1 bil­lion of lines of credit avail­able for draw­ing.</p>
