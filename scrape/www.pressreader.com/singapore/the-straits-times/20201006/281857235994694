    <p>GENEVA • Roughly one in 10 peo­ple may have been in­fected with the coro­n­avirus, leav­ing the vast ma­jor­ity of the world’s pop­u­la­tion vul­ner­a­ble to the re­lated Covid-19 dis­ease, the World Health Or­gan­i­sa­tion (WHO) said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Dr Mike Ryan, WHO’s top emer­gency ex­pert, told the agency’s ex­ec­u­tive board that out­breaks were surg­ing in parts of South-east Asia, and that cases and deaths were on the rise in parts of Europe and the east­ern Mediter­ranean re­gion.</p>
    <p>“Our cur­rent best es­ti­mates tell us 10 per cent of the global pop­u­la­tion may have been in­fected by this virus. It varies de­pend­ing on coun­try, it varies from ur­ban to ru­ral, it varies de­pend­ing on groups. But what it does mean is that the vast ma­jor­ity of the world re­main at risk,” Dr Ryan said.</p>
    <p>Over in the United States, pub­lic health of­fi­cials have ex­pressed con­cern that a sec­ond wave of the coro­n­avirus would hit New York City, which un­til re­cently had achieved strik­ing suc­cess in beat­ing back the out­break af­ter a dev­as­tat­ing spring that left more than 20,000 res­i­dents dead.</p>
    <p>On Sun­day, with those fears grow­ing, Mayor Bill de Bla­sio an­nounced an emer­gency crack­down, say­ing that he in­tended to im­pose new re­stric­tions on 20 hot spots in Brook­lyn and Queens that have been ex­pe­ri­enc­ing ris­ing pos­i­tiv­ity rates.</p>
    <p>The plan is a ma­jor set­back for New York City, amount­ing to the first sig­nif­i­cant re­ver­sal in its re­open­ing and of­fer­ing fur­ther ev­i­dence of the chal­lenges in curb­ing the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>The city, over the last month, had taken sev­eral strides for­ward, al­low­ing in­door din­ing for the first time and be­com­ing the first ma­jor school district in the coun­try to al­low chil­dren back into its pub­lic schools.</p>
    <p>But un­der the new re­stric­tions, Mr de Bla­sio would close all schools – pub­lic and pri­vate – in nine of the city’s 146 zip codes, as well as all non-es­sen­tial busi­nesses. In­door and out­door din­ing in restau­rants in those ar­eas will not be al­lowed.</p>
    <p>“To­day, un­for­tu­nately, is not a day for cel­e­bra­tion,” Mr de Bla­sio said. “To­day is a more dif­fi­cult day.”</p>
    <p>The nine ar­eas have large pop­u­la­tions of Ortho­dox Jews – com­mu­ni­ties where the virus has been spread­ing rapidly and where pub­lic health of­fi­cials have strug­gled to per­suade many res­i­dents to ad­here to guide­lines on mask wear­ing and so­cial dis­tanc­ing.</p>
    <p>Those ar­eas all have had pos­i­tiv­ity rates in re­cent days of more than 3 per cent of those tested – and some as high as 8 per cent – in con­trast to the city’s over­all rate of about 1.5 per cent.</p>
    <p>Pub­lic health of­fi­cials have been wor­ried that the uptick in cases would jump from Ortho­dox neigh­bour­hoods to oth­ers, lead­ing to a resur­gence of the virus across the city.</p>
    <p>If ap­proved by Gov­er­nor An­drew Cuomo, the plan would go into ef­fect to­mor­row.</p>
    <p>Else­where in the US, nine states have re­ported record in­creases in Covid-19 cases over the last seven days, mostly in the up­per Mid­west and West where chilly weather is forc­ing more ac­tiv­i­ties in­doors.</p>
    <p>Last Satur­day alone, four states – Ken­tucky, Min­nesota, Mon­tana and Wis­con­sin – saw record in­creases in new cases, and na­tion­ally nearly 49,000 new in­fec­tions were re­ported, the high­est for a Satur­day in seven weeks, ac­cord­ing to a Reuters analysis.</p>
    <p>Kansas, Ne­braska, New Hamp­shire, South Dakota and Wy­oming also set new records for cases last week.</p>
    <p>Health ex­perts have long warned that colder tem­per­a­tures driv­ing peo­ple in­side could pro­mote the spread of the virus.</p>
    <p>Day­time highs in the up­per Mid­west are now in the 10 deg C range.</p>
