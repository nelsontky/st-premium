    <p>Pay­ing min­i­mum sum for credit card</p>
    <p>It is a cause for con­cern that 27 per cent of adults here have ac­cu­mu­lated credit card debts that they have prob­lems pay­ing off.</p>
    <p>And by pay­ing only the min­i­mum sum, they are ac­tu­ally mak­ing it worse be­cause their over­all debt will be grow­ing at the rate of 2 per cent every month.</p>
    <p>So if you owe $10,000, your debt will grow by $200 in just a month and will keep in­creas­ing un­less you pay off or lower the prin­ci­pal sum dras­ti­cally.</p>
    <p>Note that credit card debt is one of the most com­mon causes of fi­nan­cial ruin.</p>
    <p>If you are in such a sit­u­a­tion, you need to take one of these steps now:</p>
    <p>• Talk to your bank to see if you can con­vert this debt into a per­sonal loan with a lower in­ter­est rate and a fixed in­stal­ment plan that will al­low you to pay it off slowly.</p>
    <p>Seek help from Credit Coun­selling Sin­ga­pore, which is a char­ity aimed at help­ing debtors get back on their feet. Its coun­sel­lors can help debtors plan an ef­fec­tive bud­get that will en­able them to pay off their bor­row­ings and yet have enough to live on.</p>
    <p>Like be­ing ill and see­ing a doc­tor, there is no shame in seek­ing help. It is bet­ter to con­front the is­sue than to make it worse by de­lay­ing and pay­ing only the min­i­mum sum as this will not solve the prob­lem.</p>
