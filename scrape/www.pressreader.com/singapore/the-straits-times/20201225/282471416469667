    <p>Af­ter al­most a year starved of com­pe­ti­tions, Sin­ga­pore Ath­let­ics (SA) is in no haste to add more events to its cal­en­dar for 2021, de­spite be­ing buoyed by the smooth run­ning of two meets dur­ing this Covid-19 pan­demic.</p>
    <p>The na­tional track and field body held Per­for­mance Trial events on</p>
    <p>Nov 27-29 and Dec 11-13 as a way for lo­cal ath­letes to re­turn to com­pet­ing, as well as at­tempt to hit qual­i­fi­ca­tion marks for ma­jor Games like the 2021 SEA Games in Viet­nam.</p>
    <p>SA pres­i­dent Lien Choong Luen told The Straits Times: “The suc­cess of the Per­for­mance Tri­als is great, and it gives us con­fi­dence we can carry out th­ese meets and events.</p>
    <p>“Of course things may change, but we have place­holder dates for lo­cal meets and we’re quite com­fort­able with them, so that is the sched­ule we are work­ing on.”</p>
    <p>Ear­lier this month, SA an­nounced on its web­site its cal­en­dar for next sea­son. In the first quar­ter of next year, SA plans to hold:</p>
    <p>• A Per­for­mance Trial event</p>
    <p>(Jan 23 -24)</p>
    <p>• SA Cross Coun­try Cham­pi­onship</p>
    <p>(Feb 20)</p>
    <p>• SA All Com­ers Meet 1</p>
    <p>(Feb 26-28) and 2 (March 26-28) • SA Re­lay Cham­pi­onships</p>
    <p>(March 12-14)</p>
    <p>The All Com­ers Meet, first held in 1990, is the main lo­cal meet held through­out the year, with six events planned.</p>
    <p>The Sin­ga­pore Open Track and Field Cham­pi­onships, which is nor­mally held in the first half of the year, is now ten­ta­tively sched­uled for Oct 23 and 24, with the na­tional Un­der-18 and Un­der-20 Cham­pi­onships slated for Septem­ber.</p>
    <p>Par­tic­i­pa­tion of for­eign ath­letes in the Sin­ga­pore Open, or send­ing lo­cal ath­letes over­seas – as was the norm pre-Covid – is some­thing that the as­so­ci­a­tion “con­tin­ues to look at care­fully”, said Lien, not­ing that de­ci­sions will be tied to the gov­ern­ment guide­lines.</p>
    <p>He also stressed that there was a need to al­low ath­letes to pe­ri­odise and peak at dif­fer­ent times, with qual­i­fi­ca­tion for three in­ter­na­tional com­pe­ti­tions – the SEA Games (Nov 21-Dec 2), Asean Univer­sity Games (AUG) in Thai­land (June 18-27) and World Ath­let­ics Un­der-20 Cham­pi­onships in</p>
    <p>Kenya (July 7-12) – the main fo­cus.</p>
    <p>The qual­i­fy­ing win­dow for the SEA Games closes on Aug 13, and only one lo­cal ath­lete, top fe­male sprinter Shanti Pereira, who won two bronzes in the Philip­pines last year, has booked her place for the bi­en­nial com­pe­ti­tion so far.</p>
    <p>“The cal­en­dar has been planned in a way it op­ti­mises qual­i­fi­ca­tion op­por­tu­ni­ties for ath­letes to qual­ify for th­ese ma­jor Games,” added Lien.</p>
    <p>Na­tional jumper Tia Rozario, 20, said that com­pe­ti­tion en­vi­ron­ments play a big role in lift­ing ath­letes in in­di­vid­ual sports.</p>
    <p>“Peo­ple in the lane next to you or the per­son jump­ing be­fore you, have a big im­pact on the way you per­form,” she said.</p>
    <p>“It’s a mu­tual ben­e­fit to ev­ery ath­lete, be­cause it’s great to have some­one push­ing you.”</p>
    <p>The na­tional triple jump record holder (12.26m) is some way off the SEA Games qual­i­fy­ing mark of 13.55m but is hop­ing to earn a ticket to Viet­nam in the long jump, with her per­sonal best of 5.86m closer to the qual­i­fy­ing mark of 6.16m.</p>
    <p>She par­tic­i­pated in the Per­for­mance Tri­als 2 as a pre-sea­son com­pe­ti­tion for her re­turn next year to Prince­ton Univer­sity in the United States, where she has been train­ing and study­ing since Au­gust last year.</p>
    <p>Rozario, who also plans to qual­ify for the AUG, said: “The school it­self hasn’t con­firmed its plans for the 2021 sea­son but I’ll def­i­nitely have op­por­tu­ni­ties to get those marks done, and my tar­get would be to peak in April and May.”</p>
