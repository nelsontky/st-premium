    <p>The UOB Paint­ing of the Year com­pe­ti­tion is go­ing dig­i­tal amid the Covid-19 pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Artists from Sin­ga­pore, In­done­sia, Malaysia and Thai­land are in­vited to re­spond to the theme “Sol­i­dar­ity”, and have un­til Oct 11 to sub­mit pho­tos of their art elec­tron­i­cally. Those who are short­listed will still need to send in their phys­i­cal works.</p>
    <p>The UOB Paint­ing of the Year, now in its 39th edi­tion, is Sin­ga­pore’s long­est-run­ning an­nual art award. It is open to emerg­ing and es­tab­lished artists, who stand the chance to win awards in their coun­try cat­e­gories.</p>
    <p>The most out­stand­ing es­tab­lished artist – to be an­nounced in a vir­tual cer­e­mony in Novem­ber – will re­ceive the UOB South-east Asian Paint­ing of the Year award. This comes with a cash prize of US$10,000 (S$13,600).</p>
    <p>The UOB Paint­ing of the Year award has fur­thered the ca­reers of many artists and counts sev­eral Cul­tural Medal­lion win­ners – Goh Beng Kwan, An­thony Poon and Chua Ek Kay – among its alumni.</p>
    <p>Ex­hi­bi­tions at the UOB Art Gallery in Raf­fles Place are also be­ing pre­sented in a vir­tual gallery on the bank’s web­sitethis year.</p>
    <p>Ms Lilian Chong, UOB’s ex­ec­u­tive di­rec­tor of group strate­gic com­mu­ni­ca­tions and brand, said of the vir­tual gallery: “In the pre-Covid days, we had an av­er­age of six to seven ex­hi­bi­tions a year, and al­most all of them were ded­i­cated to sup­port­ing UOB Paint­ing of the Year win­ners.</p>
    <p>“It has been in­evitable that we move on­line. A good por­tion of us are still work­ing from home and putting UOB Art Gallery on­line is a con­ve­nient way to view the art­works at your fin­ger­tips.”</p>
    <p>The vir­tual gallery is now show­ing a se­lec­tion of works by past winner Ste­fanie Hauger, 51, and will go on to fea­ture fel­low win­ners Wong Tze Chau and Ho Seok Kee.</p>
    <p>Ger­man-born Hauger, who spent the Covid-19 cir­cuit breaker tak­ing stock of her art prac­tice, says bag­ging the UOB South-east Asian Paint­ing of the Year in 2013 gave her much ex­po­sure.</p>
    <p>“I went from be­ing su­per un­known to be­ing on a su­per-fast tra­jec­tory in the pub­lic eye,” the Sin­ga­pore per­ma­nent resident added.</p>
    <p>“It was an in­cred­i­ble ex­pe­ri­ence for me. Be­ing in the pub­lic eye, of course, also opens you up to crit­i­cism... But your ar­mour grows as you go along.”</p>
    <p>(Be­fore the pan­demic), we had an av­er­age of six to seven ex­hi­bi­tions a year... A good por­tion of us are still work­ing from home and putting UOB Art Gallery on­line is a con­ve­nient way to view the art­works at your fin­ger­tips.</p>
    <p>On in­tro­duc­ing a theme for this year’s c o mp e t i t i o n , UOB’s Ms Chong said: “In this Covid-19 sit­u­a­tion, de­ter­mi­na­tion, re­silience and the no­tion of unity are im­mensely im­por­tant.</p>
    <p>“Through the UOB Paint­ing of the Year com­pe­ti­tion, we hope to un­cover and recog­nise tal­ented artists across the re­gion, and lift the com­mu­nity spirit through the ap­pre­ci­a­tion of art by send­ing a very pos­i­tive mes­sage to the world.”</p>
