    <p>MUMBAI • At least 90 peo­ple were feared trapped in the de­bris of a five-storey build­ing which col­lapsed south of In­dia’s fi­nan­cial cap­i­tal of Mumbai yes­ter­day, ac­cord­ing to po­lice in Ma­ha­rash­tra state.</p>
    <p>The build­ing, which is said to com­prise 47 flats, caved in yes­ter­day evening.</p>
    <p>The au­thor­i­ties said 28 peo­ple were pulled out by res­cue teams amid heavy mon­soon rain, and lo­cal res­i­dents joined the op­er­a­tion at the disas­ter site in Ma­had, an in­dus­trial town about 200km south of Mumbai.</p>
    <p>“Fif­teen in­jured peo­ple have been res­cued and taken to hospi­tal,” Ma­had po­lice said.</p>
    <p>The num­ber of dead is yet to be as­cer­tained.</p>
    <p>Ma­ha­rash­tra Min­is­ter of State for In­dus­tries and Tourism Aditi Tatkare said the lo­cal ad­min­is­tra­tion is try­ing to get ex­act in­for­ma­tion about how many were in­side when the build­ing col­lapsed.</p>
    <p>She has been elected to the state as­sem­bly from Shri­vard­han con­stituency in Raigad dis­trict.</p>
    <p>ANI, an In­dian news agency, in an ear­lier tweet said three floors of the five-storey build­ing col­lapsed in Ma­had, i n Ma­ha­rash­tra state’s Raigad dis­trict.</p>
    <p>The build­ing col­lapsed at around 6.50pm, a Na­tional Disas­ter Re­sponse Force ( NDRF) of­fi­cial said.</p>
    <p>Tele­vi­sion footage showed lo­cal res­i­dents and po­lice of­fi­cers comb­ing through tin sheets and other wreck­age in a des­per­ate search for sur­vivors, some us­ing bare hands.</p>
    <p>The TV footage also showed am­bu­lances leav­ing the area as peo­ple sur­round­ing it made fran­tic phone calls.</p>
    <p>Po­lice of­fi­cials from at least three di­vi­sions of Raigad rushed to the site to carry out res­cue op­er­a­tions along with NDRF teams.</p>
    <p>Three NDRF res­cue teams, armed with spe­cialised equip­ment and snif­fer dogs, were de­ployed to the scene of the ac­ci­dent, a state­ment from the NDRF said.</p>
    <p>For­mer Ma­had leg­is­la­tor Manik</p>
    <p>Moti­ram Jag­tap told the lo­cal TV9 Marathi chan­nel that the struc­ture was 10 years old and built on “weak” foun­da­tion.</p>
    <p>“It fell like a house of cards,” he said. “It is a scary sit­u­a­tion.”</p>
    <p>TV9 Marathi re­ported that be­tween 200 and 250 peo­ple could be in the build­ing.</p>
    <p>The of­fice of Mr Ud­dhav Thack­eray, chief min­is­ter of Ma­ha­rash­tra state, said on Twit­ter that he had been in touch with lo­cal rep­re­sen­ta­tives in the area.</p>
    <p>“He has as­sured them that all pos­si­ble sup­port will be ex­tended for speedy res­cue and re­lief works,” the tweet said.</p>
    <p>The cause of the ac­ci­dent was not clear, but build­ing col­lapses are com­mon dur­ing In­dia’s June to Septem­ber mon­soon, with rick­ety struc­tures buck­ling un­der the weight of non-stop rain.</p>
    <p>The In­dia Me­te­o­ro­log­i­cal De­part­ment last Fri­day fore­cast “heavy to very heavy rain­fall” in Mumbai and neigh­bour­ing Thane, Raigad and Pal­ghar dis­tricts over the next 24 hours with gusty winds.</p>
    <p>An or­ange alert in­di­cat­ing heavy to very heavy rain­fall was is­sued for last Satur­day for Mumbai, Pal­ghar, Thane, Raigad and Rat­na­giri dis­tricts.</p>
    <p>Last month, heavy rain in Mumbai caused the col­lapse of a mul­ti­storey build­ing, killing nine peo­ple and in­jur­ing sev­eral oth­ers.</p>
    <p>The mon­soon plays a vi­tal role in boost­ing agri­cul­tural har­vests across South Asia. But it also causes wide­spread death and de­struc­tion, un­leash­ing floods, trig­ger­ing build­ing col­lapses and in­un­dat­ing low-ly­ing vil­lages.</p>
    <p>The death toll from mon­soon-re­lated disas­ters this year has topped 1,200, in­clud­ing more than 800 lives lost in In­dia alone.</p>
