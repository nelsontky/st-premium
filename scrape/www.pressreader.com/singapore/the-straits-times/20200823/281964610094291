    <p>SAN FRAN­CISCO • A group of WeChat users has asked a fed­eral judge to block the Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion from im­pos­ing a ban on what they say ap­pears to be all uses of the Chi­nese mes­sag­ing app in the United States over na­tional se­cu­rity con­cerns.</p>
    <p>In a com­plaint filed in fed­eral court in San Fran­cisco on Fri­day, Chi­nese-Amer­i­can lawyers who formed the US WeChat Users Al­liance are claim­ing that Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump’s planned re­stric­tion on the app is un­con­sti­tu­tional.</p>
    <p>His Aug 6 order bans Amer­i­cans from car­ry­ing out trans­ac­tions with WeChat and TikTok, another pop­u­lar Chi­nese so­cial me­dia plat­form, as of the mid­dle of next month.</p>
    <p>The “vaguely worded” ex­ec­u­tive order does not de­fine what trans­ac­tions will be pro­hib­ited, the lawyers said.</p>
    <p>It also leaves peo­ple and firms at a loss of whether they will vi­o­late the order if they do not fun­da­men­tally change the way they com­mu­ni­cate or run their busi­nesses, the lawyers added.</p>
    <p>They linked Mr Trump’s order with his re­cent com­ments that have been crit­i­cal of China, in­clud­ing blam­ing the coun­try for the coro­n­avirus pan­demic.</p>
    <p>“Nei­ther the ex­ec­u­tive order it­self nor the White House pro­vided con­crete ev­i­dence to sup­port the con­tention that us­ing WeChat in the United States com­pro­mises na­tional se­cu­rity,” the group said in the com­plaint. They claim that Mr Trump’s order vi­o­lates WeChat users’ free speech and due process rights be­cause it does not pro­vide no­tice of the spe­cific con­duct that is pro­hib­ited.</p>
    <p>WeChat – which was de­vel­oped by Ten­cent Hold­ings– is used by mil­lions of Amer­i­cans and US res­i­dents to com­mu­ni­cate with peo­ple whose first lan­guage is Chi­nese, ac­cord­ing to the al­liance.</p>
