    <p>Lee Wei Kai, who was pre­vi­ously at Phillip Se­cu­ri­ties, faces 61 charges of false trad­ing in 44 se­cu­ri­ties on 61 oc­ca­sions.</p>
    <p>Lim Ming Yi, for­merly with May­bank Kim Eng Se­cu­ri­ties, faces 55 charges of false trad­ing in 41 se­cu­ri­ties on 55 oc­ca­sions, and Lim Ming Chit, a for­mer remisier at Phillip Se­cu­ri­ties, faces 22 charges of false trad­ing in 19 se­cu­ri­ties on 22 oc­ca­sions.</p>
    <p>Alan Lee was of­fered bail of $250,000, while the re­main­ing four were of­fered bail of $40,000.</p>
    <p>The of­fences al­legedly took place be­tween March 2015 and April 2016. If found guilty, the five face a max­i­mum fine of $250,000 and a jail term of up to seven years for each charge of false trad­ing.</p>
