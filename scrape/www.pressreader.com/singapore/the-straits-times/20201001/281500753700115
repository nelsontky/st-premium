    <p>The wind­ing up of es­tab­lished travel agency STA Travel is a blow to the in­dus­try, but no wave of mass clo­sures is ex­pected to fol­low for now, ob­servers say.</p>
    <p>De­spite a near-zero busi­ness en­vi­ron­ment, the num­ber of travel agent clo­sures over the last eight months has re­mained rela­tively low at 22, about half that of the same pe­riod last year, fig­ures from the Sin­ga­pore Tourism Board (STB) show.</p>
    <p>In­dus­try play­ers say this is likely due to the fact that the ma­jor­ity of op­er­a­tors have pared costs and gone into hi­ber­na­tion mode, kept afloat by gov­ern­ment sup­port schemes. Some have also piv­oted to sell stay­ca­tion pack­ages to the do­mes­tic mar­ket, while agents that cater to in­bound tourism are now fo­cus­ing on Sin­ga­pore-bound in­ter­na­tional stu­dents.</p>
    <p>STA Travel stopped op­er­a­tions last month, af­ter its Swiss-based par­ent com­pany filed for in­sol­vency in Au­gust.</p>
    <p>Mr Sam­son Tan, chief ex­ec­u­tive of GTMC Travel, said the ex­ten­sion of wage sub­si­dies through March next year has been a life­line for many, while em­ploy­ees are also tak­ing pay cuts, go­ing on train­ing cour­ses and be­ing re­de­ployed dur­ing the lull.</p>
    <p>His firm has also moved into a smaller of­fice which it shares with an­other travel agent to save on rent.</p>
    <p>“I think af­ter March if noth­ing hap­pens and the Gov­ern­ment doesn’t ex­tend (wage sub­si­dies), a lot may call it a day. But most can hang on till then,” he said.</p>
    <p>Ms Ali­cia Seah, direc­tor of pub­lic re­la­tions and com­mu­ni­ca­tions at Dy­nasty Travel, said the firm is gear­ing up for the re­sump­tion of cor­po­rate travel.</p>
    <p>As safety con­sid­er­a­tions and coun­try-spe­cific re­quire­ments are now a ma­jor con­cern for trav­ellers, “the role of travel agents will be­come even more es­sen­tial post-Covid”, she said.</p>
    <p>Mr Steven Ler, pres­i­dent of the Na­tional As­so­ci­a­tion of Travel Agents Sin­ga­pore, said he sees light at the end of the tunnel, given the high de­mand for struc­tured itin­er­ar­ies and end-to-end travel so­lu­tions as busi­ness and es­sen­tial travel picks up.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore’s move to al­low big­ger con­fer­ences of up to 250 peo­ple will bring more vis­i­tors in the com­ing months, and the in­dus­try is work­ing with ground op­er­a­tors to en­sure a smooth process, he said.</p>
    <p>There is also strong, pent-up de­mand for leisure travel, he added.</p>
    <p>“Cus­tomers want to know what they need to be aware of, such as when they need to un­dergo the swab test, if they need to be quar­an­tined and whether there is a list of ap­proved places to stay. Th­ese are some of the pieces we are try­ing to pull to­gether,” he said.</p>
