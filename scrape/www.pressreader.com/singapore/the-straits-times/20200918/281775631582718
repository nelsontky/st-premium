    <p>Sin­ga­pore and Switzer­land are jointly chairing a global ini­tia­tive to sup­port eq­ui­table ac­cess to a Covid-19 vac­cine, Deputy Prime Min­is­ter and Fi­nance Min­is­ter Heng Swee Keat said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore is an early sup­porter of the Covid-19 Vac­cine Global Ac­cess (Co­vax) Fa­cil­ity, said Mr Heng in a Face­book post, and is co-chairing the Friends of the Co­vax Fa­cil­ity ini­tia­tive with Switzer­land, to pro­mote vac­cine mul­ti­lat­er­al­ism.</p>
    <p>Ear­lier in the evening, Mr Heng, to­gether with Health Min­is­ter Gan</p>
    <p>Kim Yong, took part in the vir­tual Joint Fi­nance and Health Min­is­ters Meet­ing hosted by Group of 20 (G-20) chair­man Saudi Ara­bia.</p>
    <p>Thank­ing his Saudi coun­ter­parts for their lead­er­ship on global ef­forts to fight the pan­demic, Mr Heng, who is also Co­or­di­nat­ing Min­is­ter for Eco­nomic Poli­cies, said: “Health and fi­nance have al­ways been closely in­ter­twined, and in a pan­demic, this is even more so.”</p>
    <p>He noted that coun­tries, in­ter­na­tional or­gan­i­sa­tions and the pri­vate sec­tor are “join­ing forces to ac­cel­er­ate vac­cine devel­op­ment, max­imise man­u­fac­tur­ing ca­pac­ity, and en­sure eq­ui­table dis­tri­bu­tion”.</p>
    <p>A spokesman for the Health Min­istry pre­vi­ously said Sin­ga­pore was among the first coun­tries to sub­mit an ex­pres­sion of in­ter­est to join the Co­vax Fa­cil­ity back in June.</p>
    <p>The Co­vax fi­nanc­ing scheme will en­able fast and eq­ui­table ac­cess to</p>
    <p>Covid-19 vac­cines for the 76 coun­tries in­volved, along with 92 other poorer coun­tries that are sup­ported un­der the scheme.</p>
    <p>The scheme is co-led by Gavi, the Vac­cine Al­liance; the World Health Or­gan­i­sa­tion (WHO); and the Coali­tion for Epi­demic Pre­pared­ness In­no­va­tions. By work­ing with multi­na­tional and de­vel­op­ing coun­try vac­cine man­u­fac­tur­ers, the Co­vax Fa­cil­ity aims to de­liver two bil­lion doses of safe, ef­fec­tive vac­cines that have passed reg­u­la­tory ap­proval and/or WHO pre-qual­i­fi­ca­tion by the end of next year.</p>
    <p>In his post, Mr Heng said: “Covid-19 is a global cri­sis, so in­ter­na­tional co­op­er­a­tion is crit­i­cal. The G-20, which cov­ers nearly 80 per cent of the world’s econ­omy, and the World Health Or­gan­i­sa­tion have key roles to play.”</p>
    <p>The G-20 fi­nance and health min­is­ters said in a state­ment last night that eq­ui­table and af­ford­able ac­cess to vac­cines for all is key to over­com­ing the pan­demic and sup­port­ing the global eco­nomic re­cov­ery.</p>
    <p>“We will con­tinue to use all avail­able pol­icy tools to safe­guard peo­ple’s lives, jobs and in­comes”, the group said, adding that an ac­tion plan will be pre­sented at the G-20 fi­nance min­is­ters and cen­tral bank gov­er­nors meet­ing next month, and later at the G-20 lead­ers’ sum­mit in Novem­ber.</p>
    <p>Mr Heng also em­pha­sised that as coun­tries restart their economies in a safe man­ner, they need to co­or­di­nate their re­sump­tion of ac­tiv­i­ties. “As we restart air travel, test­ing will be key to give as­sur­ance to trav­ellers and pub­lic health au­thor­i­ties. We must work to­gether to de­velop in­ter­na­tional stan­dards, and share test re­sults quickly, in­clud­ing through elec­tronic means,” he said.</p>
    <p>“We must also con­tinue to iden­tify gaps and strengthen our health and fi­nan­cial re­silience against fu­ture out­breaks.”</p>
    <p>The meet­ing comes as a study re­leased by Ox­fam showed a group of wealthy coun­tries rep­re­sent­ing just 13 per cent of the world pop­u­la­tion have bought up over half the promised Covid-19 vac­cine stocks.</p>
    <p>Global coron­avirus cases crossed the 30 mil­lion mark yes­ter­day, with over 940,000 deaths and the pan­demic show­ing no signs of abat­ing.</p>
