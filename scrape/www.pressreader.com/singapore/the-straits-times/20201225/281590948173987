    <p>Team sports en­thu­si­asts will have rea­son to cheer from Mon­day when phase three of Sin­ga­pore’s re­open­ing starts, as groups of eight will be al­lowed, up from five. Bas­ket­ball, foot­ball (left), hockey and vol­ley­ball play­ers can com­pete four against four, in­stead of be­ing re­stricted to kick­abouts or ca­sual play cur­rently.</p>
    <p>Week­end war­riors can now look for­ward to hav­ing more par­tic­i­pants – from five to eight – in team sports such as bas­ket­ball and foot­ball when Sin­ga­pore moves to phase three of its re­open­ing on Mon­day.</p>
    <p>In a Face­book post yes­ter­day, Mr Ed­win Tong, Min­is­ter for Cul­ture, Com­mu­nity and Youth, wrote: “In line with Phase 3 of re­open­ing, the cap on group sizes for sport­ing ac­tiv­i­ties will in­crease to eight from next Mon­day.</p>
    <p>“This means team sports like bas­ket­ball, foot­ball, hockey and vol­ley­ball can now re­sume with a 4v4 for­mat. Larger fa­cil­i­ties can have more than one zone. Not quite time for a 4-3-3 or 4-3-1-2 for­ma­tion (for foot­ball) yet, but this gives sports fans some ad­di­tional op­tions.”</p>
    <p>Dragon boaters can also take to the wa­ter in groups of eight, while fit­ness en­thu­si­asts can par­tic­i­pate in stu­dio classes com­pris­ing groups of eight as long as they ad­here to the re­vised safe man­age­ment re­quire­ments, said the min­is­ter.</p>
    <p>He added: “Sport is vi­tal to our phys­i­cal and men­tal well-be­ing, and as an en­joy­able recre­ational ac­tiv­ity. We want to en­sure that more Sin­ga­pore­ans can play and en­joy sport, safely.”</p>
    <p>Tutor Jeremy Ong, 34, wel­comed the news and is look­ing for­ward to hav­ing a kick about on New Year’s Day. He said: “While we un­der­stood the multi-min­istry task force must have its rea­sons to come up with the num­bers it did to curb the spread of the coro­n­avirus, five was a bit point­less when it comes to street soc­cer.</p>
    <p>“Four-v-four is a lot more com­pet­i­tive and I think it is the right move as we seem to have the virus sit­u­a­tion un­der con­trol for now, and this will en­cour­age peo­ple to ex­er­cise more, within the safe mea­sures, of course.”</p>
    <p>Na­tional agency Sport Sin­ga­pore (SportSG) also is­sued an ad­vi­sory yes­ter­day for the re­sump­tion of sport, phys­i­cal ex­er­cise and ac­tiv­ity for phase three of the econ­omy’s re­open­ing.</p>
    <p>Aside from the changes to group sizes for team sports and ac­tiv­i­ties, the max­i­mum num­ber of per­sons al­lowed at all sports and recre­ational fa­cil­i­ties shall be lim­ited ac­cord­ing to its gross floor area based on 8 sq m per per­son – down from 10 sq m per per­son – or 50 peo­ple, which­ever is lower.</p>
    <p>Re­quests to ad­mit more than 50 peo­ple may be made to SportSG for large venues that can be or­gan­ised into sep­a­rate fa­cil­i­ties.</p>
    <p>In­di­vid­u­als must still main­tain a 2m dis­tance while ex­er­cis­ing, while groups shar­ing a space must not in­ter­act and must be 3m apart. Masks should be worn as a de­fault but can be taken off while per­form­ing stren­u­ous ex­er­cise.</p>
