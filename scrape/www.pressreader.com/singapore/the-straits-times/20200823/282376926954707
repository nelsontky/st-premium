    <p>The Bat­tle­box</p>
    <p>This World War II bunker at Fort Can­ning Hill evokes a gamut of emo­tions about the un­fold­ing of war.</p>
    <p>In one room, the clock shows 9.30am. It is Feb 15, 1942, and the com­man­der of the Al­lied forces de­fend­ing Malaya and Sin­ga­pore is hours away from sur­ren­der­ing to the in­vad­ing Ja­panese.</p>
    <p>Lieu­tenant-Gen­eral Arthur Per­ci­val holds court in a tableau of wax fig­ures in this former Bri­tish com­mand cen­tre. Later, he will be blamed for the fall of Sin­ga­pore. For now, he an­nounces a plan to stave off disas­ter.</p>
    <p>But he is per­suaded oth­er­wise by 11 other top mil­i­tary men in the meet­ing room. The writ­ing is on the wall – the Bri­tish and other troops in Sin­ga­pore have only two days of food left.</p>
    <p>This sus­pense­ful, blow-by-blow ac­count of how the de­ci­sion to sur­ren­der was made in this un­der­ground bunker is nar­rated on video.</p>
    <p>Metic­u­lously re­searched, the facts and arte­facts pre­sented could over­turn some peo­ple’s per­cep­tions about World War II.</p>
    <p>The In­tan</p>
    <p>The In­tan, a pri­vate Per­anakan mu­seum, calls to mind Ali Baba’s cave.</p>
    <p>While im­mac­u­late, with nary a mote of dust or mis­aligned piece of fur­ni­ture, it is the kind of place where you half-ex­pect to trip over some­thing valu­able.</p>
    <p>It is a trove of bling and beads. There are dif­fer­ent kerosang, or tra­di­tional Per­anakan brooches; chains of the epony­mous in­tan, or roughly cut di­a­monds of vin­tage Per­anakan jew­ellery; and about 250 pairs of ka­sut manek, or Per­anakan beaded slip­pers.</p>
    <p>There are even wrap­pers em­bed­ded with beads, spe­cially made for nian gao, a dessert that is pop­u­lar dur­ing Chi­nese New Year.</p>
    <p>The stair­case is lined en­tirely on one side with multi-coloured tingkat, or tif­fin car­ri­ers, while vin­tage spit­toons flank the other side.</p>
    <p>There are old black-and-white photos of Per­anakan strangers,</p>
    <p>In­for­ma­tion pan­els tell of how Per­ci­val had filed a pre­scient re­port to his su­pe­ri­ors in the mid-1930s, on how an en­emy could ac­cess south Thai­land and north­ern Malaya, which could leave Sin­ga­pore vul­ner­a­ble.</p>
    <p>Ja­panese forces landed in those places in De­cem­ber 1941, but Bri­tish de­fences were in­ad­e­quate. The en­emy thun­dered through Malaya to reach Sin­ga­pore in 55 days.</p>
    <p>The loss, risk and end­less de­lib­er­a­tions of war come through, as do more sub­tle emo­tions, such as a wist­ful hope­ful­ness and the bore­dom of wait­ing for bat­tle.</p>
    <p>Graf­fiti in the toi­let shows a Spit­fire, a fighter plane that did not see ac­tion in Sin­ga­pore. Per­haps the sol­dier who doo­dled it thought it could have made a dif­fer­ence to his war.</p>

    <p>Owner Alvin Yapp (right), 50, who lives in this pri­vate home-cum­mu­seum in Joo Chiat, is a mag­pie col­lec­tor of all things Per­anakan, a hobby he started when he was a teen in­ter­ested in find­ing out more about his Per­anakan back­ground.</p>
    <p>He has amassed about 5,000 arte­facts in more than 30 years, and feels a re­spon­si­bil­ity to­wards pre­serv­ing his cul­ture.</p>
    <p>He has an eclec­tic sense of hu­mour about his col­lec­tion, though. He points to a tall side­board which is adorned with a phoenix and pe­onies – aus­pi­cious Per­anakan em­blems. In the mid­dle of it all perches an in­con­gru­ous pair of Amer­i­can ea­gles.</p>

    <p>Fancy a dose of cul­ture this week­end?</p>
    <p>If you have ex­hausted the big guns, like Na­tional Gallery Sin­ga­pore and the Na­tional Mu­seum, why not visit less well­known, niche mu­se­ums?</p>
    <p>With the au­thor­i­ties urg­ing Sin­ga­pore res­i­dents to pa­tro­n­ise home-grown at­trac­tions and boost do­mes­tic tourism un­der Covid-19, now may be the best time to ex­plore the ob­scure mu­se­ums sprin­kled across the is­land.</p>
    <p>These niche places rep­re­sent a chance to un­der­stand the un­wa­ver­ing zeal of col­lec­tors of mu­si­cal boxes, med­i­cal equip­ment and war para­pher­na­lia.</p>
    <p>Mr Alvin Yapp, the 50-year-old owner of The In­tan, a pri­vate Per­anakan mu­seum, for in­stance, has been col­lect­ing the an­tiques of his her­itage since he was a teen.</p>
    <p>Small mu­se­ums delve into what ap­pears to be a nar­row in­ter­est, but in­vari­ably il­lu­mi­nate some­thing larger.</p>
    <p>Here are some niche mu­se­ums to check out.</p>
    <p>Hos­pi­tal mu­se­ums</p>
    <p>Some hospi­tals have mu­se­ums on their premises that pro­vide an in­trigu­ing glimpse into med­i­cal history in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>At Tan Tock Seng Hos­pi­tal (TTSH) Her­itage Mu­seum, lo­cated on the first floor of the hos­pi­tal, there is a bed (above) with a hole carved out in the mid­dle, with a con­tainer for bod­ily waste un­der­neath. It was used by pa­tients with cholera, who had se­vere di­ar­rhoea.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore Gen­eral Hos­pi­tal (SGH) Mu­seum, at Bowyer Block Clock Tower in the hos­pi­tal in Out­ram Road, also has its share of eye­brow-rais­ing equip­ment, like an am­pu­tat­ing saw used to cut off gan­grenous limbs in the early 1900s.</p>
    <p>SGH Mu­seum also com­mem­o­rates world-class lo­cal medics. Dr Tay Chong Hai, for in­stance, was the first Sin­ga­pore physi­cian to have a dis­ease named after him in</p>
    <p>Kreta Ayer Her­itage Gallery</p>
    <p>At just 100 sq m, Kreta Ayer Her­itage Gallery is a small and beau­ti­ful gem. Lo­cated within Kreta Ayer Com­mu­nity Club, it show­cases the rich history of Kreta Ayer and Chi­na­town, where a red-hot arts scene sprung up when early Chi­nese im­mi­grants set­tled there.</p>
    <p>A pho­to­graph of a jam-packed crowd be­fore a Chi­nese opera stage near the former El­len­bor­ough Mar­ket, taken in the 1890s, shows how these singers were yes­ter­year’s pop su­per­stars.</p>
    <p>Two face­less man­nequins wear­ing Can­tonese opera cos­tumes take pride of place in the gallery.</p>
    <p>The male gen­eral in bat­tle cos­tume wears gold and black (above, right), with scale-like mo­tifs rep­re­sent­ing an­cient Chi­nese ar­mour. The fe­male gen­eral’s cos­tume is softly sump­tu­ous in pink and blue, with more fem­i­nine touches like tas­sels.</p>
    <p>I lis­ten to the record­ing of tradi1971. Tay syn­drome is a rare ge­netic dis­ease char­ac­terised by un­usu­ally dry skin and brit­tle hair.</p>
    <p>Around that time, he also dis­cov­ered that Chi­nese herbal pills on sale then, which were pre­scribed for asthma, con­tained the poi­son arsenic, a discovery that prompted an out­cry and led to stricter reg­u­la­tion.</p>
