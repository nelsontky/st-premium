    <p>Lionel Messi, 33, has re­port­edly told new Barcelona coach Ron­ald Koe­man that he is more likely to leave than stay at the Spanish La Liga club he joined at the age of 13, ac­cord­ing to ex­ten­sive cov­er­age in the Spanish me­dia.</p>
    <p>• Lionel Messi still wishes to leave Barcelona af­ter meet­ing new coach Ron­ald Koe­man, ac­cord­ing to re­ports in the Spanish me­dia yes­ter­day, as all four sports news­pa­pers ded­i­cated their front cov­ers to the club cap­tain’s un­cer­tain fu­ture.</p>
    <p>Marca, Spain’s big­gest sell­ing daily, said the Ar­gentina for­ward told the Dutch­man, who was ap­pointed on a two-year deal on Wed­nes­day, that he was more likely to leave the club than to stay, while AS de­clared on its cover that “Messi sees him­self leav­ing”.</p>
    <p>Barcelona-based daily Mundo De­portivo said the 33-year-old “does not see his fu­ture clearly”, but stressed that it was un­likely he would leave the club im­me­di­ately due to his €700 mil­lion (S$1.1 bil­lion) re­lease clause.</p>
    <p>Messi, who joined aged 13, has scored a record 634 goals in 730 matches and is also the club’s most dec­o­rated player with 33 tro­phies. He is also 37 games away from match­ing Xavi Her­nan­dez as the club’s all-time ap­pear­ance maker.</p>
    <p>But Messi is into the fi­nal year of his con­tract at the club and doubts about his fu­ture have grown since last week’s his­toric 8-2 thrash­ing by Bay­ern Mu­nich in the quar­ter-fi­nals of the Cham­pi­ons League, a com­pe­ti­tion Barca have failed to win since 2015.</p>
    <p>Cata­lan daily Sport also talked of a “first sum­mit meet­ing” be­tween the six-time Bal­lon d’Or win­ner and Koe­man.</p>
    <p>It added that Messi in­ter­rupted his hol­i­days to air his feel­ings about the tur­moil at the Nou Camp, with Barca en­dur­ing their first tro­phy­less sea­son since 2008.</p>
    <p>At his pre­sen­ta­tion cer­e­mony on Wed­nes­day, Koe­man in­sisted that he wanted Messi to com­mit his fu­ture to Barca, although he did not show as much rev­er­ence to the player as some of his pre­de­ces­sors.</p>
    <p>How­ever, with his con­tract run­ning out next June, the top scorer in La Liga last sea­son with 25 league goals will be free to ne­go­ti­ate with other clubs from Jan­uary.</p>
    <p>Messi’s salary, re­ported to be the high­est in foot­ball at €8.2 mil­lion a month, means few clubs would be able to af­ford him, with the ex­cep­tion of the Mid­dle East-backed Manch­ester City and Paris Sain­tGer­main.</p>
