    <p>Sin­ga­pore has no plans to dig fur­ther into its na­tional re­serves for an­other $8 bil­lion that is needed to con­tinue the coun­try’s bat­tle against the Covid-19 pan­demic.</p>
    <p>In­stead, the ex­tra ex­pen­di­ture will come out of the cof­fers of devel­op­ment projects that are be­ing de­layed be­cause of the pan­demic, Deputy Prime Min­is­ter Heng Swee Keat said yes­ter­day in a min­is­te­rial state­ment.</p>
    <p>De­lays in ma­jor con­struc­tion projects be­cause of the cir­cuit breaker and the need to en­sure a safe re­open­ing of the con­struc­tion sec­tor sub­se­quently have shrunk Sin­ga­pore’s 2020 devel­op­ment ex­pen­di­ture by an es­ti­mated $6.9 bil­lion, the Finance Min­istry said in an an­nex to Mr Heng’s state­ment.</p>
    <p>Like­wise, Sin­ga­pore’s op­er­at­ing ex­penses are set to de­cline as well by an es­ti­mated $1.5 bil­lion.</p>
    <p>The drop is mainly due to lower mil­i­tary ex­pen­di­ture be­cause of pan­demic-re­lated de­lays in projects and the can­cel­la­tion or de­fer­ment of ex­er­cises.</p>
    <p>An­other rea­son is lower man­power costs as civil ser­vants did not get the usual mid-year bonus this year, said the min­istry.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day’s an­nounce­ment of the ad­di­tional $8 bil­lion needed is on top of the nearly $100 bil­lion from the ear­lier four 2020 Budgets un­veiled be­tween Fe­bru­ary and May to tackle the evolv­ing Covid-19 cri­sis.</p>
    <p>The lat­est aid is for the ex­panded mea­sures to save jobs, cre­ate new ones and help Sin­ga­pore seize new op­por­tu­ni­ties for growth in a post­coro­n­avirus world.</p>
    <p>“I have briefed the Pres­i­dent and the Coun­cil of Pres­i­den­tial Ad­vis­ers on the lat­est sit­u­a­tion and the need for these mea­sures,” said Mr Heng, who is also the Co­or­di­nat­ing Min­is­ter for Eco­nomic Poli­cies and Finance Min­is­ter.</p>
    <p>“I thank them for their ear­lier sup­port and ap­proval for the use of past re­serves to re­spond to the cri­sis, which has put us on a strong foot­ing to man­age the evolv­ing sit­u­a­tion.”</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, his min­istry also gave an in­terim up­date of Sin­ga­pore’s Bud­get es­ti­mates for the 2020 fi­nan­cial year end­ing March 31 next year.</p>
    <p>With the lower es­ti­mated ex­pen­di­ture and rev­enue plus the ex­tra $8 bil­lion needed, Sin­ga­pore’s over­all Bud­get deficit is forecast to be $74.2 bil­lion this fi­nan­cial year, a tad lower than the $74.3 bil­lion deficit pro­jected in May this year.</p>
    <p>Op­er­at­ing rev­enue is now pro­jected to be $63.7 bil­lion, which is $5.1 bil­lion, or 7.4 per cent, lower than the re­vised es­ti­mate given in May’s For­ti­tude Bud­get.</p>
    <p>The de­cline is mainly due to the “more sub­dued eco­nomic growth en­vi­ron­ment due to Covid-19 and lower eco­nomic ac­tiv­ity dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker pe­riod”.</p>
    <p>This, in turn, led to lower than ex­pected rev­enues of $4.1 bil­lion, pri­mar­ily from goods and ser­vices tax, bet­ting taxes and stamp duty, said the Finance Min­istry.</p>
    <p>An­other ma­jor rev­enue damp­ener is the ex­ten­sion in the waiver of for­eign worker levies an­nounced at the start of this month. It amounted to an es­ti­mated $0.9 bil­lion.</p>
    <p>At the same time, Sin­ga­pore is forecast to spend a to­tal of $102.1 bil­lion, which is $8.4 bil­lion, or 7.6 per cent, lower than the May es­ti­mate.</p>
    <p>Its op­er­at­ing ex­pen­di­ture is ex­pected to be $85.4 bil­lion, which is $1.5 bil­lion, or 1.7 per cent, lower than the sum an­nounced in May.</p>
    <p>“The de­creases are par­tially off­set by ad­di­tional ex­pen­di­ture for fur­ther Covid-19 sup­port mea­sures such as sec­tor-spe­cific sup­port and mea­sures to bol­ster so­cial re­silience and pub­lic health,” the Finance Min­istry added.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, devel­op­ment ex­pen­di­ture is es­ti­mated to be $16.7 bil­lion, or 29. 2 per cent, lower than the sum an­nounced in May.</p>
    <p>But spe­cial trans­fers are es­ti­mated to rise to $54.5 bil­lion, which is $3.2 bil­lion, or 6.3 per cent, higher than the May es­ti­mates.</p>
    <p>The in­crease is mainly due to the ex­ten­sion of the Jobs Sup­port Scheme to cover wages up to March next year. The Net In­vest­ment Re­turns Con­tri­bu­tion – the re­turns from Sin­ga­pore’s in­vested re­serves – is ex­pected to be $18.6 bil­lion. This re­mains un­changed from the May es­ti­mate.</p>
    <p>De­lays in ma­jor con­struc­tion projects be­cause of the cir­cuit breaker and the need to en­sure a safe re­open­ing of the con­struc­tion sec­tor sub­se­quently have shrunk Sin­ga­pore’s 2020 devel­op­ment ex­pen­di­ture by an es­ti­mated $6.9 bil­lion, the Finance Min­istry said in an an­nex to Mr Heng’s state­ment.</p>
