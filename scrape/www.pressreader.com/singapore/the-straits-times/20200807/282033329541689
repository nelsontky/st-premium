    <p>Peo­ple who can­not at­tend this year’s Na­tional Day Pa­rade (NDP) evening show can fol­low the per­for­mances and sing along to the songs with the help of an e-guide re­leased yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>This year’s Na­tional Day cel­e­bra­tions are dif­fer­ent from those in the past, with Covid-19 re­stric­tions re­sult­ing in a se­ries of de­cen­tralised events across the is­land, hap­pen­ing at dif­fer­ent times through­out the day.</p>
    <p>It is also the first time the NDP has been split into a morn­ing pa­rade seg­ment and an evening show.</p>
    <p>Only 150 peo­ple will be at­tend­ing the evening event, which will be held at the Star Vista.</p>
    <p>But mem­bers of the pub­lic can still tune in to the per­for­mances from the com­fort of their homes, with the down­load­able guide re­leased by the NDP2020 ex­ec­u­tive com­mit­tee.</p>
    <p>The 45-page e-book­let con­tains a de­tailed break­down of the show’s six seg­ments, as well as a syn­op­sis of the en­tire per­for­mance and its themes.</p>
    <p>It also lists the lyrics for all the songs that will be per­formed at the show, start­ing at 7pm.</p>
    <p>This year’s show will fea­ture stars such as JJ Lin, Stephanie Sun, Nathan Hartono, Dick Lee and Char­lie Lim, and will be in­ter­spersed with sto­ries of Sin­ga­pore­ans striv­ing to over­come Covid-19 to­gether.</p>
    <p>In the book­let’s in­tro­duc­tion, the NDP2020 ex­ec­u­tive com­mit­tee wrote: “We can ex­pect an in­ti­mate and mean­ing­ful show that presents the in­spi­ra­tional sto­ries of ev­ery­day Sin­ga­pore­ans in this ex­tra­or­di­nary year... we hope that this guide, packed with in­for­ma­tion and song lyrics, will serve as a use­ful ref­er­ence through­out the show.”</p>
