    <p>Or­gan­is­ers of the Chi­nese Grand Prix say they have asked For­mula One man­age­ment to move the Shang­hai race from April to later in the 2021 cal­en­dar, Mo­tor­sport.com has re­ported.</p>
    <p>“We have been in con­tact (with F1) via con­fer­ence call al­most ev­ery week,” Yang Yibin, the gen­eral man­ager of race pro­moter Juss Event, was quoted as say­ing by the web­site.</p>
    <p>“De­spite the cal­en­dar be­ing in place as usual, I think it’s hugely un­cer­tain the F1 race would take place in the first half of the year, in</p>
    <p>April. We aim to swop it to the sec­ond half of the year, and we have for­mally sub­mit­ted the re­quest that we hope to move it to the sec­ond half of the year.”</p>
    <p>As­ton Martin team owner Lawrence Stroll said last week that agree­ment had al­ready been reached to post­pone the Aus­tralian Grand Prix to the back end of the sea­son, with Bahrain, sched­uled for March 28, re­plac­ing it as the open­ing race due to the Covid-19 pan­demic.</p>
    <p>The sport saw many races can­celled last year due to the cri­sis, with the race cal­en­dar even­tu­ally re­duced from 22 rounds to 17 across Europe and the Mid­dle East and some cir­cuits, in­clud­ing Bahrain, Bri­tain and Aus­tria, host­ing two Grands Prix.</p>
    <p>F1 an­nounced its 2021 cal­en­dar in Novem­ber fea­tur­ing a record 23 rounds. To date, the 2019 sea­son with 21 races re­mains the most held in a sin­gle sea­son.</p>
    <p>Given the pan­demic, most ob­servers be­lieve that F1 is be­ing overly am­bi­tious by at­tempt­ing to break that record, with Haas team prin­ci­pal Guen­ther Steiner fear­ing the first half of the up­com­ing sea­son will be dis­rupted.</p>
    <p>“While it looks likely that Aus­tralia will be post­poned, I think the Bahrain race will hap­pen,” he told</p>
    <p>Plan­etF1.com. “What comes after, I have no idea.</p>
    <p>“At the mo­ment, it’s very dif­fi­cult for me to un­der­stand what’s hap­pen­ing in China, so I think there will be a dif­fi­cult be­gin­ning of the sea­son.</p>
    <p>“Maybe I’m be­ing pes­simistic, but I think we’ll have to deal with that for the first six months of the year.</p>
    <p>“After that, I hope we can see the in­flu­ence of the vac­cines and things should be more solid and more pre­dictable.</p>
    <p>“But for the first six months, I think it will be a lit­tle bit like last year was.”</p>
    <p>China, which is the host of the 2022 Win­ter Olympics, has ei­ther can­celled or resched­uled most global sport­ing events since the start of the pan­demic, and should the Shang­hai race be post­poned, its stag­ing may come at the ex­pense of other events.</p>
    <p>“To move it to the sec­ond half of the year, it de­pends on the plan of the city gov­ern­ment,” Yang added. “If we put all in­ter­na­tional events to the sec­ond half of the year, it will be over the ca­pac­ity for the city.”</p>
