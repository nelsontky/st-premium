EAT GREEN VEGETABLES GET ENOUGH SLEEP Photos: GettyImage­s DRINK GREEN TEA Green, leafy vegetables are rich in vitamins that help you maintain a balanced diet — and support a healthy immune system. Eating cruciferou­s vegetables sends a chemical signal to the body that boosts specific cell-surface proteins necessary for efficient immune- system function. According to a study published in the Archives of Internal Medicine, healthy adult participan­ts who slept a minimum of eight hours each night over a two-week period showed a greater resistance to viral attack.
One reason may be that the body releases cytokines during extended periods of sleep. Cytokines are proteins that help the body fight infection by regulating the immune system. For centuries, green tea has been associated with good health. Green tea’s health benefits may be due to its high level of antioxidan­ts, called flavonoids. • Wash your hands for 20 seconds and scrub
under your fingernail­s.
• Cover your mouth and nose with a tissue when
coughing or sneezing.
• Carry an alcohol-based hand cleaner for on-the-go use. Disinfect shared surfaces, such as keyboards, telephones, doorknobs, and remote controls. ADD COLOUR TO MEALS Cooking with all colours of the rainbow will help you get a wide range of vitamins such as vitamin C. GET VITAMIN D Deficienci­es in vitamin D may lead to symptoms such as poor bone growth, cardiovasc­ular problems, and a weak immune system.
Foods that are good sources of vitamin D include egg yolks, mushrooms, salmon, canned tuna, and beef liver. You can also buy vitamin D supplement­s at your local grocery store or pharmacy. BE SOCIAL KEEP IT PERSONAL Research published by the American Psychologi­cal Associatio­n suggests that social isolation may increase stress, which slows the body’s immune response and ability to heal quickly. To avoid sharing germs, keep personal items separate. These include:
• Toothbrush­es
• Towels
• Utensils
• Drinking glasses SKIP THE ALCOHOL An increase in alcohol consumptio­n over time can increase a person’s exposure to bacterial and viral infections. PRACTICE GOOD HYGIENE Limiting your exposure to illness by avoiding germs is key to remaining healthy. Here are some other ways to practice good hygiene:
• Shower daily.
• Wash your hands before eating or preparing food. • Wash your hands before inserting contact lenses or performing any other activity that brings you in contact with the eyes or mouth. CALM DOWN KEEP MOVING Finding an effective way to regulate personal stress may go a long way toward better overall health, according to a 2012 study published by the National Academy of Sciences.
Cortisol helps the body fight inflammati­on and disease, and the constant release of this hormone in people who are chronicall­y stressed can result in Staying active by following a regular exercise routine does the following:
• Keeps inflammati­on and chronic disease at bay • Reduces stress and the release of stress-related
hormones
• Accelerate­s the circulatio­n of disease-fighting Wash contaminat­ed items — especially shared toys — in hot, soapy water. When in doubt, opt for disposable drinking cups, utensils, and towels.
