    <p>• MasterChef Ju­nior fan favourite Ben Watkins, 14, died of a rare form of can­cer on Mon­day, three years after his par­ents were killed in a do­mes­tic vi­o­lence in­ci­dent.</p>
    <p>The teenager, who ap­peared on Sea­son 6 of the culinary cook­ing show when he was 11, was di­ag­nosed with an­gioma­toid fi­brous his­ti­o­cy­toma days be­fore his 13th birth­day last year. It is an ex­tremely rare soft­tis­sue tu­mour that oc­curs in a small num­ber of chil­dren and young adults.</p>
    <p>His un­cle An­thony Ed­wards and grand­mother Donna Ed­wards said in a state­ment on Mon­day that he had gone “home to be with his mother”.</p>
    <p>The state­ment, posted on a Go­FundMe page, added: “After los­ing both his par­ents in Septem­ber 2017, we have mar­velled at Ben’s strength, courage and love for life. He never, ever com­plained. Ben was and will al­ways be the strong­est per­son we know.”</p>
    <p>His par­ents died in a dou­ble tragedy in 2017, leav­ing him an or­phan. His fa­ther had shot and killed his mother, then him­self.</p>
    <p>Watkins had just fin­ished film­ing MasterChef Ju­nior at the time. When the sea­son aired the fol­low­ing year, view­ers fell in love with the as­pir­ing chef and raised US$30,000 (S$40,250) as a trust fund for him.</p>
    <p>Celebrity chef Gor­don Ramsey, who hosted MasterChef Ju­nior, wrote on In­sta­gram: “Ben, you were an in­cred­i­bly tal­ented home cook and even stronger young man. Your young life had so many tough turns, but you al­ways per­se­vered.”</p>
