    <p>Christ­mas and New Year’s Eve are all about feast­ing.</p>
    <p>On Jan 1 – okay, maybe Jan 2 – the res­o­lu­tions kick in.</p>
    <p>If you re­solve to eat bet­ter and more healthily, but do not want bor­ing food, head to Mad About Su­cre in the Bukit Pa­soh area.</p>
    <p>I know. The name gave me pause too. I re­sisted go­ing to the six-year-old restau­rant be­cause I am not crazy about sugar. But you do not have to be.</p>
    <p>In fact, the desserts are sweet­ened nat­u­rally, mostly with fruit; and the food is free of ar­ti­fi­cial in­gre­di­ents, ad­di­tives and preser­va­tives. I sense some col­lec­tive eye-rolling, so I will just say this: It is all de­li­cious.</p>
    <p>Start with 4-hour Stew Of</p>
    <p>To­ma­toes, Hand­picked Crab­meat ($19), which is tomato soup made with fresh and dried to­ma­toes. It is just creamy enough and full of umami from the to­ma­toes. The crab meat adds a touch of luxe, but it would taste good even with­out it.</p>
    <p>Many din­ers or­der the foie gras salad ($42, serves two, above right). The goose liver is eth­i­cally farmed, so there is no need to have con­vul­sions. The grilled prawns and caviar are great too. But what thrills me most is the salad dress­ing, made with whipped egg white, olive oil and mus­tard. It looks like 1970s “salad cream”, but tastes vi­brant and tangy, and is so good with the ten­der greens. The salad is a warm one, but never feels heavy, even with the foie gras.</p>
    <p>An­other must-or­der is Grilled Cau­li­flower ($35). The cau­li­flower is charred at the ends, but is also very ten­der in the mid­dle. And, as my friend says af­ter one bite: “Flavours ex­plod­ing ev­ery­where.”</p>
    <p>Yes, from the zippy gherkin salsa un­der­neath, from the miso glaze that coats the out­side of the cau­li­flower, from the al­monds and from the crunchy sour­dough bread­crumbs. I want ev­ery­one who was dis­ap­pointed by the cau­li­flower at that new Is­raeli restau­rant to taste this one.</p>
    <p>I am happy to have this as my main course, but that would mean miss­ing out on the ox­tail stew ($42), sim­mered over eight hours. Low and slow cook­ing pays off in spades. The meat is fork-ten­der, the sauce deeply flavour­ful from the Bur­gundy red it is cooked with.</p>
    <p>The founders, Mr James Tan and sib­lings Eric and Lena Chan, have cre­ated a place where peo­ple with al­ler­gies can eat safely, and where chil­dren mag­i­cally gob­ble up veg­eta­bles even if they refuse to eat them at home. They cook and bake for cus­tomers the way they would for their own fam­i­lies.</p>
    <p>Cor­don Bleu-trained Lena Chan’s desserts are gor­geous and de­li­cious. I try the Christ­mas of­fer­ings, both shaped iden­ti­cally like white Christ­mas baubles. The in­sides are dif­fer­ent and while the one filled with fig is good, I much pre­fer the zing of Jaune ($25), with ex­plo­sions of lemon, lime, mint and white rum.</p>
    <p>I ex­pect to roll out of the restau­rant, but am not weighed down by the food. Just what I need at the start of a new year.</p>
