    <p>When we first glimpse her, min­utes into Sea­son 4 of The Crown, Lady Diana Spencer is dressed as a tree and hid­ing be­hind a plant, the pic­ture of long-legged in­no­cence in a fo­liage-fes­tooned leo­tard.</p>
    <p>“Sorry, I’m not here,” she says coyly to Prince Charles, the heir to the Bri­tish throne, who has ar­rived at her fam­ily’s es­tate for a date with her older sis­ter Sarah.</p>
    <p>“That’s sneaky of her,” Sarah says to Charles af­ter­wards. “I told her to leave us alone.”</p>
    <p>Here is Diana in her con­tra­dic­tory glory, naive and con­niv­ing, full of charm and full of guile, destined to marry a prince and wreak havoc on a monar­chy. Ev­ery­one al­ready knows the sorry end to this dis­as­trous love story.</p>
    <p>But the new sea­son of The Crown (just re­leased) takes view­ers back to its be­gin­ning, when Charles was a self-pity­ing bach­e­lor, Diana was an un­worldly earl’s daugh­ter and the world was thrilled to be­lieve in what seemed like the hap­pi­est of fairy tales.</p>
    <p>Fans of the drama se­ries have been wait­ing for this sea­son, an­tic­i­pat­ing the sto­ry­line they know best: the emer­gence of Diana as the glam­orous, at­ten­tion-suck­ing vor­tex around which the royal fam­ily swirled for so many years.</p>
    <p>Even Prince Harry and his wife Meghan, the royal fam­ily’s new­est rebels, look wan and dull in com­par­i­son to Diana, who was not just “the Peo­ple’s Princess”, as then prime min­is­ter Tony Blair called her, but an in­ter­na­tional su­per­star for the tabloid age.</p>
    <p>With its i ntox­i­cat­ing stew of in­gre­di­ents – roy­alty, beauty, adul­tery, me­dia in­trigue – the tale of the doomed princess has been one of the most ra­bidly con­sumed true-life tales of the past few decades.</p>
    <p>Even 23 years after her death, Diana is still a cot­tage in­dus­try, her story fu­elling books, films, doc­u­men­taries, mu­si­cals, plays, minis­eries and even present-day tabloid sto­ries.</p>
    <p>Now the new sea­son of Net­flix’s se­ries, un­der the watch­ful eye of its writer Peter Mor­gan, has to per­form its great­est high-wire act yet: how to make such a fa­mil­iar story feel fresh and new.</p>
    <p>For the part of Diana, it cast the un­known ac­tress Emma Cor­rin, 24, a re­cent Cam­bridge Univer­sity grad­u­ate, who plays the princess from the ages of 16 to 28.</p>
    <p>View­ers will no­tice Cor­rin has got Diana’s sig­na­ture se­duc­tive ges­ture – head tilt­ing to the side, eyes glanc­ing co­quet­tishly up­wards through her bangs – just right.</p>
    <p>But in­hab­it­ing Diana pre­sented chal­lenges. “It’s a lot to take on and a l ot of pres­sure,” Cor­rin said, adding that the se­ries is fic­tion.</p>
    <p>“I never went into this think­ing I wanted to em­body or mimic her,” she added. “I think of her more as a char­ac­ter and this is my in­ter­pre­ta­tion of her.”</p>
    <p>Mor­gan’s multi-gen­er­a­tional saga, an en­thralling mix of se­ri­ous his­tory and frothy gos­sip, has al­ready spanned more than 30 years.</p>
    <p>This new sea­son takes view­ers into the 1980s, the era of big hair and puffy dresses, of pleated pants and Con­ser­va­tive gov­ern­ment.</p>
    <p>In Bri­tain, it was the decade of Mrs Mar­garet Thatcher, the coun­try’s first fe­male prime min­is­ter (Gil­lian An­der­son, her man­ner im­pe­ri­ous and her voice full of card­board).</p>
    <p>In­ti­mate de­vel­op­ments in the lives of the Queen and her fam­ily are set against the sweep of Bri­tish pol­i­tics and the wider forces of his­tory: the Falk­lands war, the Ir­ish Trou­bles, Mrs Thatcher’s ef­forts to re­make her party and up­end the wel­fare state, and the sub­se­quent eco­nomic up­heaval.</p>
    <p>Mor­gan said he had ap­proached the new sea­son in the same way he has all along, but that ex­pec­ta­tions for it seemed higher.</p>
    <p>“I’m slightly more con­scious of ac­cu­racy as op­posed to truth and I’m lean­ing into ac­cu­racy as much as I can,” he said.</p>
    <p>Luck­ily, the re­search team had a trove of first-hand ma­te­rial to draw on. The vi­cis­si­tudes of the royal mar­riage were ag­gres­sively cov­ered by the Bri­tish tabloid press, of­ten with the tacit help of Diana (al­though she de­nied it then).</p>
    <p>The pro­duc­tion also turned to Jonathan Dim­bleby’s ex­haus­tive bi­og­ra­phy of Prince Charles, writ­ten with his help and pro­vid­ing an in­sight into his dif­fi­cult re­la­tion­ship with his par­ents; and An­drew Mor­ton’s ex­plo­sive bi­og­ra­phy of Diana, based on hours of con­fes­sional tape record­ings from her and full of juicy de­tails about her mar­riage.</p>
    <p>“In ear­lier sea­sons, our sub­jects were not given to this kind of sel­f­re­flec­tion, so this was very help­ful,” said Ms An­nie Sulzberger, the pro­duc­tion’s head of re­search.</p>
    <p>The show had a team of ad­vis­ers with di­rect knowl­edge of the events, a change from pre­vi­ous sea­sons when “there were fewer peo­ple alive we could talk to”, said Ms Oona O’Beirn, a Crown pro­ducer.</p>
    <p>As al­ways, they have taken many cin­e­matic lib­er­ties.</p>
    <p>View­ers of The Crown in Bri­tain are al­ready de­bat­ing what is ac­cu­rate and what has been changed for dra­matic pur­poses. In one episode, for in­stance, Diana gets a crash course in royal fam­ily pro­to­col – where to walk, where to stand, how to speak in pub­lic.</p>
    <p>In real life, Ms Sulzberger said, the in­struc­tion came from two mem­bers of the palace staff.</p>
    <p>But The Crown gives the job to Diana’s grand­mother, the harsh Lady Fer­moy, a lady-in-wait­ing to the Queen Mother known for tes­ti­fy­ing in court against her own daugh­ter, Diana’s mother, dur­ing Diana’s par­ents’ bit­ter divorce.</p>
    <p>“We had ad­vice that Lady Fer­moy was more of the kind of</p>
    <p>I never went into this think­ing I wanted to em­body or mimic her... this is my in­ter­pre­ta­tion of her.</p>
    <p>taskmas­ter we were look­ing for,” Ms O’Beirn said.</p>
    <p>The re­sult­ing scenes are painful. Diana re­ally does come across as a lamb to the slaugh­ter, a de­scrip­tion she once used of her­self.</p>
    <p>Ms Sulzberger said that with so many peo­ple alive to re­mem­ber what hap­pened, the show was par­tic­u­larly con­cerned with plumb­ing the nu­ances of the story. That meant ac­knowl­edg­ing po­ten­tial bias even in knowl­edge­able sources.</p>
    <p>For in­stance, ac­counts sym­pa­thetic to Diana at the time stressed her de­spair over Charles’ in­fi­delity while con­ve­niently elid­ing her own adul­ter­ous ad­ven­tures.</p>
    <p>But The Crown makes it clear that there were two sides to the tale, show­ing Diana promis­ing the Queen she will give up her lover, James He­witt, and then go­ing back to him after Charles fails to end his af­fair with Camilla Parker Bowles.</p>
    <p>Both Cor­rin and ac­tor Josh O’Con­nor, who re­turned this sea­son as Charles (he will be re­placed next sea­son by Do­minic West and she by El­iz­a­beth De­bicki), said they tried to not take sides in the mil­lion-dol­lar ques­tion sur­round­ing Charles and Diana’s dis­as­trous mar­riage: Whose fault was it? The Crown gives ev­i­dence for both po­si­tions and nei­ther po­si­tion.</p>
    <p>Au­di­ence re­ac­tions at early screen­ings, Mor­gan said, have been emo­tional.</p>
    <p>“I’m in­clined to think for the viewer, there is now an in­creased sense of con­nec­tion,” he said. “Peo­ple are feel­ing it far more vividly.”</p>
    <p>It all feels like voyeuris­tic fun, es­pe­cially in ev­ery scene fea­tur­ing Olivia Col­man, who brings a droll, in-on-the-joke arch­ness to the role of Queen El­iz­a­beth this sea­son.</p>
    <p>Be­cause the real-life Queen is scrupu­lously dull and an­o­dyne in pub­lic, most of her pri­vate con­ver­sa­tions are wholly made up – but true to her char­ac­ter, said Mor­gan, who has made a ca­reer of plumb­ing the per­sonal lives of pub­lic fig­ures and who has stud­ied the queen in the past.</p>
    <p>As al­ways, we re­turn to Diana, who re­mains as com­pli­cated and un­know­able in death as she was in life.</p>
    <p>Was she the saviour of the royal fam­ily, drag­ging a stul­ti­fied in­sti­tu­tion, and a na­tion along with it, into the modern age with her hu­man­ity and com­mon touch? Or were her emo­tional up­heavals alarm­ingly anti-Bri­tish and rather un­hinged, a de­base­ment of cen­turies of stiff-up­per-lip rec­ti­tude?</p>
    <p>It re­mains to be seen how the fi­nal two sea­sons of The Crown will treat Diana’s legacy.</p>
    <p>But if you leave this sea­son be­liev­ing that to be a com­plex ques­tion – as in­deed are the re­la­tion­ships be­tween the Queen and her fam­ily, the Queen and her gov­ern­ment and the Queen and her coun­try – then Mor­gan will have done his job.</p>
    <p>You do not even have to be a flag­wav­ing roy­al­ist to care what The Crown re­veals about the Wind­sors and the king­dom over which they pre­side.</p>
    <p>Mor­gan him­self is not a royal fan, he says. He is much more in­ter­ested in his char­ac­ters’ unique po­si­tion as both pri­vate and pub­lic fig­ures, their per­sonal lives in­ex­tri­ca­bly in­ter­twined with the his­tory of their coun­try.</p>
    <p>“Once you’ve spent time with these char­ac­ters,” he said, speak­ing of his job as au­thor of this on­go­ing drama, “you don’t pass judg­ment on them.”</p>
