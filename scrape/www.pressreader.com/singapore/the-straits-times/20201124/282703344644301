    <p>Aries (March 21 - April 19)</p>
    <p>You have to lead the way. Things are look­ing up, but only if you seize con­trol (in a way) and show your people that there are more op­tions.</p>
    <p>Taurus (April 20 - May 20)</p>
    <p>This is not a good time to make pur­chases of any kind, un­less you have been plan­ning them for a good long time. Watch your wal­let.</p>
    <p>Gemini (May 21 - June 20)</p>
    <p>A good friend needs to get some alone time with you. You need each other, but you are likely to get more out of this en­counter than him.</p>
    <p>Can­cer (June 21 - July 22)</p>
    <p>It is eas­ier to get riled up than it is to calm down, so do your best to avoid sit­u­a­tions you know could spin into con­flict.</p>
    <p>Leo (July 23 - Aug 22)</p>
    <p>You are hav­ing great fun with a new hobby or project. Your ter­rific per­sonal en­ergy means that you should learn a lot and in­spire oth­ers to do the same.</p>
    <p>Virgo (Aug 23 - Sept 22)</p>
    <p>You may run into a few prob­lems with col­leagues, es­pe­cially if you need to rely on some­one to take care of your busi­ness. Do not take it per­son­ally.</p>
    <p>Libra (Sept 23 - Oct 22)</p>
    <p>You find it harder than usual to ac­cept giv­ing up so much, thanks to a deep vein of ego. Let go and learn to com­pro­mise.</p>
    <p>Scorpio (Oct 23 - Nov 21)</p>
    <p>Some­one close needs help at work or at home, so dive in and give him what he needs. Your pay­ment is likely to come much later.</p>
    <p>Sagittariu­s (Nov 22 - Dec 21)</p>
    <p>Take plea­sure in life’s lit­tle won­ders and try to show your people why their fears are ill-founded. Make life sweeter for ev­ery­one.</p>
    <p>Capricorn (Dec 22 - Jan 19)</p>
    <p>You need to blow off some­one or some­thing. It is a good time to be firm and di­rect as you tell whomever it is that you have other things to do.</p>
    <p>Aquarius (Jan 20 - Feb 18)</p>
    <p>You spot a pat­tern in some small part of life that no­body else has no­ticed yet, so run with it. Your en­ergy is un­usu­ally fo­cused, which is per­fect for your needs.</p>
    <p>Pisces (Feb 19 - March 20)</p>
    <p>You are ask­ing all the wrong ques­tions, but at least one of your an­swers still turns out to be use­ful. You know the truth when you see it.</p>
