    <p>BANGKOK • Hong Kong and Thai­land have both seen their streets filled with pro­test­ers dar­ing to take on an en­trenched po­lit­i­cal elite and dis­cuss once-taboo sub­jects in their push for greater free­doms.</p>
    <p>Po­lit­i­cal an­a­lyst Vo­ranai Vani­jaka, from Bangkok’s Tham­masat Univer­sity, said tech-savvy youth in both ter­ri­to­ries have “shared cul­tural val­ues”.</p>
    <p>“It’s the love for free­dom and the courage to fight for change.”</p>
    <p>Here are five sim­i­lar­i­ties be­tween pro­test­ers in Thai­land and Hong Kong:</p>
    <p>1. TAK­ING ON POW­ER­FUL TAR­GETS</p>
    <p>Both move­ments are pri­mar­ily mo­ti­vated by in­equal­ity and the de­sire for democ­racy, but in push­ing for a greater say in how their fates are forged, they are tak­ing on for­mi­da­ble foes re­sis­tant to change.</p>
    <p>For Hong Kong, it is the rul­ing Chi­nese Com­mu­nist Party, which crushes dis­sent on the main­land and has in­creased con­trol over the rest­less semi-au­ton­o­mous city.</p>
    <p>Bei­jing has re­jected the pro­test­ers’ calls for greater democ­racy and po­lice ac­count­abil­ity, and has, since June 30, im­posed a na­tional se­cu­rity law on the fi­nan­cial hub that has snuffed out mass dis­sent for now.</p>
    <p>In Thai­land, it is the monar­chy – backed by the pow­er­ful mil­i­tary – that sits at the apex of the po­lit­i­cal pyra­mid.</p>
    <p>For now, it is un­clear how the palace will re­act to the protests, but in pre­vi­ous pe­ri­ods of tur­bu­lence, it has played a piv­otal role in de­cid­ing the out­come.</p>
    <p>2. RULE OF LAW OR RULE BY LAW?</p>
    <p>The way the au­thor­i­ties use the law has been a key cat­a­lyst.</p>
    <p>The ini­tial spark in Hong Kong was an even­tu­ally aborted ex­tra­di­tion Bill, which would have al­lowed peo­ple to be sent to main­land China for trial in courts con­trolled by the Com­mu­nist Party.</p>
    <p>The protest then mor­phed into an anti-gov­ern­ment move­ment and a wider push for uni­ver­sal suf­frage.</p>
    <p>In Thai­land, the king­dom’s dra­co­nian lese ma­jeste law – which shields the monar­chy from crit­i­cism – has been a cru­cial com­po­nent of calls for re­form, as well as pros­e­cu­tions un­der broadly worded sedi­tion and cy­ber­crime laws.</p>
    <p>Mul­ti­ple crit­ics of the Thai monar­chy have also dis­ap­peared, with the Hu­man Rights Watch record­ing at least nine cases in­volv­ing ac­tivists over­seas.</p>
    <p>The cur­rent round of protests came af­ter Thai pro-democ­racy ac­tivist Wan­chalearm Sat­sak­sit was al­legedly kid­napped in Cam­bo­dia in June. He has not been seen since.</p>
    <p>3. YOUTH-LED</p>
    <p>Young peo­ple are at the heart of the calls for re­form.</p>
    <p>Hong Kong’s huge ral­lies rep­re­sented a broad swathe of so­ci­ety, from stu­dents to lawyers, bus drivers, civil ser­vants and teach­ers.</p>
    <p>But the front-line ac­tivists – and those em­brac­ing in­creas­ingly vi­o­lent tac­tics – were over­whelm­ingly young. Many face pros­e­cu­tion and years in jail.</p>
    <p>Some of Hong Kong’s most vis­i­ble ac­tivists, such as Joshua Wong and Ms Agnes Chow, were teenagers when they first got in­volved in pol­i­tics.</p>
    <p>Thai­land’s protest lead­ers – most of whom have been ar­rested in the past week – are in their early 20s and are sim­i­larly more will­ing to em­brace con­fronta­tional tac­tics than older gen­er­a­tions.</p>
    <p>4. TABOOS SHAT­TERED</p>
    <p>Taboo top­ics have been thrust cen­tre stage.</p>
    <p>In Hong Kong, young ac­tivists were more will­ing than their older coun­ter­parts to em­brace the idea of au­ton­omy and even out­right in­de­pen­dence from China – a con­cept that re­mains a red line for Bei­jing.</p>
    <p>As the protests dragged on and the au­thor­i­ties re­fused ma­jor con­ces­sions, chants and flags declar­ing “Lib­er­ate Hong Kong, rev­o­lu­tion of our times” be­came com­mon­place.</p>
    <p>In Thai­land, even talk­ing about the con­cept of re­form­ing the monar­chy is enough to land some­one in jail. But peo­ple have be­gun to lose that fear.</p>
    <p>Young ac­tivists have given speeches call­ing for the lese ma­jeste law to be abol­ished and called for the king’s huge per­sonal wealth – es­ti­mated to be some US$60 bil­lion (S$81.4 bil­lion) – to have a clear di­vi­sion of as­sets be­tween pub­lic and per­sonal.</p>
    <p>5. PROTEST TAC­TICS</p>
    <p>Thai pro­test­ers donned hard hats, gog­gles, gas masks and um­brel­las against wa­ter can­non over the week­end in im­ages that could have come straight out of Hong Kong last year.</p>
    <p>Young ac­tivists in both places have also swopped tac­tics on­line and of­fered mes­sages of sup­port.</p>
    <p>Links have grown be­tween pro­test­ers through a so-called Milk Tea Al­liance, re­fer­ring to drinks pop­u­lar in both places.</p>
    <p>Both protest move­ments are us­ing en­crypted so­cial mes­sag­ing plat­forms to mo­bilise and have opted for flash mob ral­lies – es­pe­cially since the au­thor­i­ties ar­rested key lead­ers.</p>
    <p>Hand sym­bols have also taken cen­tre stage.</p>
    <p>In Hong Kong, a raised palm sym­bol­ises the “Five de­mands, not one less” slo­gan.</p>
    <p>Thais, mean­while, have em­braced a three-fin­ger salute from the dystopian Hunger Games movies.</p>
