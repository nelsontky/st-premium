    <p>The Malaysian gov­ern­ment said yes­ter­day it has yet to fi­nalise plans for the Kuala Lumpur-Sin­ga­pore High-Speed Rail (HSR) project, after a news re­port claimed it was con­sid­er­ing changes so that the line ends in Jo­hor Baru and not Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>Eco­nomic Af­fairs Min­is­ter Mustapa Mo­hamed said the gov­ern­ment has made sev­eral new pro­pos­als to “im­prove” the project, say­ing that both Malaysia and Sin­ga­pore have un­til Dec 31 to ne­go­ti­ate the mat­ter.</p>
    <p>“Re­fer­ring to some of the news pub­lished re­cently re­gard­ing the HSR project, Malaysia and Sin­ga­pore are still in the process of ne­go­ti­at­ing on some pro­pos­als sub­mit­ted by Malaysia to im­prove this project,” he said in a state­ment.</p>
    <p>“Both coun­tries have un­til 31 Dec 2020 to con­duct the ne­go­ti­a­tion process. The gov­ern­ment will make an an­nounce­ment once a de­ci­sion is made and ne­go­ti­a­tions are com­pleted,” he added.</p>
    <p>The state­ment comes two days after news por­tal Free Malaysia To­day (FMT) re­ported that Malaysia is con­sid­er­ing mak­ing changes to the HSR project so that the line would end in Jo­hor Baru, rather than in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>This would mean the project, first an­nounced in 2010, would resume with­out Sin­ga­pore’s par­tic­i­pa­tion.</p>
    <p>The project has been sus­pended twice at Malaysia’s re­quest. The first ex­ten­sion in Septem­ber 2018 was to end in May this year, but this was ex­tended for a sec­ond and fi­nal time, till Dec 31 this year.</p>
    <p>FMT had also re­ported that its two sources were crit­i­cal of the lat­est change, with one say­ing it would call into ques­tion the sus­tain­abil­ity of the project.</p>
    <p>The source noted that the project was touted as a game changer on one of the world’s busiest air routes.</p>
    <p>He said end­ing the line in Jo­hor Baru would cre­ate re­dun­dancy, given there are fu­ture plans to con­nect the KL Sen­tral train sta­tion to JB Sen­tral sta­tion with trains trav­el­ling up to 160kmh un­der Malaysian rail op­er­a­tor KTM’s elec­tric train ser­vice project.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore’s Min­istry of Trans­port had, in re­sponse to me­dia queries on the re­port, con­firmed that Malaysia had pro­posed some changes to the project, say­ing that Sin­ga­pore has been dis­cussing them in good faith with Malaysia and will re­main fully com­mit­ted to ful­fill­ing its obli­ga­tions un­der the HSR bi­lat­eral agree­ment.</p>
    <p>If Malaysia does not pro­ceed with the project by Dec 31, it will bear the agreed costs in­curred by Sin­ga­pore in ful­fill­ing the HSR bi­lat­eral agree­ment. It was signed in De­cem­ber 2016, wit­nessed by Prime Min­is­ter Lee Hsien Loong and then Malaysian Prime Min­is­ter Na­jib Razak in Putrajaya.</p>
    <p>After a change of gov­ern­ment fol­low­ing the 2018 elec­tions, then Pre­mier Ma­hathir Mo­hamad ini­tially wanted to scrap the HSR project in a re­view of his coun­try’s mega projects.</p>
    <p>The Pakatan Hara­pan ad­min­is­tra­tion later clar­i­fied that it wanted to de­lay the start of con­struc­tion, as a can­cel­la­tion would have en­tailed Malaysia pay­ing a high amount of com­pen­sa­tion un­der the HSR agree­ment.</p>
    <p>In July, PM Lee said the ba­sic think­ing be­hind the HSR – that Sin­ga­pore and KL are two cities with sig­nif­i­cant links, and im­proved con­nec­tiv­ity will lead to more business and closer ties – re­mained true.</p>
    <p>The pro­posed 350km rail line would cut trav­el­ling time be­tween KL and Sin­ga­pore to 90 min­utes, com­pared with over four hours by car. It would also cut by more than half the cur­rent end-to-end travel time of about five hours by air.</p>
