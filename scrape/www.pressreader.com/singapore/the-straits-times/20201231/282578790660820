    <p>The way he works, the amount of time he puts in, two years ago, he was an All-Star and last year, he was our best player. He is in a great place right now and he’s ready to have a ter­rific, ter­rific year.</p>
    <p>OKLAHOMA CITY • The Or­lando Magic have been bounced out of the first round of the Na­tional Bas­ket­ball As­so­ci­a­tion (NBA) play­offs in the past two sea­sons.</p>
    <p>They in­tend to do bet­ter this sea­son.</p>
    <p>It is early days but after im­prov­ing to 4-0 for the first time in their 32-year his­tory, a deeper post-sea­son run in the Eastern Con­fer­ence play-offs could be a dis­tinct pos­si­bil­ity.</p>
    <p>Nikola Vuce­vic scored 28 points to lift the vis­i­tors to a 118-107 road win over the Oklahoma City Thun­der on Tues­day, mean­ing Or­lando are just one of two un­beaten teams – the un­de­feated Atlanta Hawks played at the Brook­lyn Nets this morn­ing – left in the NBA.</p>
    <p>The game was tied early in the fourth quar­ter, but as usual, the Magic closed strong.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing their hot start, they have scored at least 30 points in the fourth quar­ter in ev­ery game, outscor­ing their op­po­nents by at least nine points each time.</p>
    <p>The Magic are av­er­ag­ing 36.5 points in the fourth and it was no dif­fer­ent at the Ch­e­sa­peake En­ergy Arena, where they outscored Oklahoma City 31-22 in the fi­nal quar­ter.</p>
    <p>While Markelle Fultz, the No. 1 pick in the 2017 draft, pow­ered Or­lando in the fourth in their pre­vi­ous two wins, Dwayne Ba­con pro­vided the of­fen­sive punch down the stretch on Tues­day.</p>
    <p>Ba­con’s three buck­ets early in the fourth helped his team start to pull away after the Thun­der tied the game early on.</p>
    <p>The for­ward, who came in av­er­ag­ing just four points, scored eight of his 18 points in the fourth and fin­ished 9 of 10 from the field.</p>
    <p>The main man, how­ever, was again Vuce­vic, their only All-Star.</p>
    <p>The 2.13m Mon­tene­grin cen­tre be­came Or­lando’s fran­chise leader in field goals by mak­ing 12 against the Thun­der for 4,083 over­all, pass­ing pre­vi­ous holder Nick An­der­son by eight.</p>
    <p>On the big man, who is en­ter­ing his ninth year with the fran­chise, Magic coach Steve Clifford said: “He’s such a pro­fes­sional and such a com­mit­ted, con­sci­en­tious player.</p>
    <p>“He gives me a lot of credit for him play­ing well since I got here (in 2018). There’s no guy here that I’ve done less to help than him.</p>
    <p>“The way he works, the amount of time he puts in, two years ago, he was an All-Star and last year, he was our best player. He is in a great place right now and he’s ready to have a ter­rific, ter­rific year.”</p>
    <p>But de­spite the plau­dits, Vuce­vic is not sit­ting on his lau­rels, as the Magic have not ad­vanced past the first round of the play-offs since 2009-10 and have only twice made it to the NBA Fi­nals, los­ing on both oc­ca­sions.</p>
    <p>“We’re happy where we are, to start the sea­son 4-0, but we also at the same time are aware that there are so many things we can do bet­ter, es­pe­cially on the de­fen­sive end,” he said.</p>
    <p>“The pos­i­tive is know­ing we were able to win, so now we can work on those things, get bet­ter and take a step for­ward.”</p>
    <p>STEVE CLIFFORD, Or­lando coach, prais­ing key player Nikola Vuce­vic, who is now their fran­chise leader in field goals.</p>
