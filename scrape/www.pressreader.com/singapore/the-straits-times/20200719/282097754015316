    <p>LON­DON • Manch­ester United and Chelsea will fight it out to­day for a place in the FA Cup fi­nal, but the ver­bal bat­tle be­tween the two man­agers had al­ready be­gun be­fore their clash at Wem­b­ley.</p>
    <p>United boss Ole Gun­nar Sol­sk­jaer hit back at Frank Lam­pard yes­ter­day, af­ter his Chelsea coun­ter­part sug­gested that video as­sis­tant ref­er­ees (VAR) have favoured the Red Devils this sea­son.</p>
    <p>Lam­pard com­mented on Fri­day how a “clear and ob­vi­ous de­ci­sion” went United’s way a day ear­lier when Crys­tal Palace’s Wil­fried Zaha was fouled but no penalty was awarded. Jor­dan Ayew also saw a goal ruled out for off­side in that Premier League match, which United won 2-0.</p>
    <p>Speak­ing at his vir­tual press con­fer­ence, Sol­sk­jaer sug­gested that his side have also been un­lucky with de­ci­sions this cam­paign.</p>
    <p>“It looks like there’s a nar­ra­tive, it looks like peo­ple want to in­flu­ence who­ever is mak­ing the de­ci­sions,” the Nor­we­gian said.</p>
    <p>“I hear peo­ple talk­ing about luck, that we’ve been lucky more than un­lucky. But if you look at the fac­tual de­ci­sions, if you’re off­side, you’re off­side, that’s clear.”</p>
    <p>He listed in­ci­dents in which he felt his team were hard done by, de­scrib­ing how a late penalty against Tot­ten­ham was over­turned and how Southamp­ton’s Oriol Romeu and West Ham’s Mark Noble should have been sent off for rash tack­les.</p>
    <p>“So it’s ac­tu­ally me that should be com­plain­ing that we get de­ci­sions against us,” he added.</p>
    <p>“There’s a nar­ra­tive there but we have to fo­cus on our games, we let other peo­ple talk about that. I don’t want to go too much into it be­cause I might be in trou­ble.</p>
    <p>“I’m pretty re­laxed on these and ref­er­ees are go­ing to be mak­ing ob­jec­tive de­ci­sions and are not go­ing to be in­flu­enced by any emo­tion in any way. So I don’t think they will read (what Lam­pard said).”</p>
    <p>United, who are on an im­pres­sive 19-game un­beaten run in all com­pe­ti­tions, have al­ready beaten Chelsea three times this sea­son.</p>
    <p>The Blues were thrashed 4-0 at Old Traf­ford in Lam­pard’s first Premier League game in charge. They also suf­fered a 2-1 loss to United in the League Cup fourth round, while Sol­sk­jaer’s team ex­tended their dom­i­nant run with a 2-0 league vic­tory at Stam­ford Bridge in Fe­bru­ary.</p>
    <p>If United were to beat the Blues again, for­wards Mar­cus Rash­ford and An­thony Mar­tial – who have each scored 22 goals in all com­pe­ti­tions in their ca­reer-best sea­sons – could be key to­day.</p>
    <p>“They’ve been to­gether at the club for so long, there was a spell where they were chal­leng­ing for</p>
    <p>Chelsea’s record against Manch­ester United in their three meet­ings this sea­son. the same po­si­tion. But now, they play to­gether and are start­ing to click,” for­mer United striker Sol­sk­jaer said.</p>
    <p>“They know each other’s strengths, weak­nesses... I do more (work) with strik­ers than de­fend­ers, that’s true. I like to join in and give them point­ers and tips. We look at goal­keep­ers, how they stand, we do a lot of work but it is the ef­fort from the boys.”</p>
    <p>Left-back Luke Shaw will miss the game and his re­place­ment Bran­don Wil­liams is also doubt­ful af­ter suf­fer­ing a fa­cial in­jury against Southamp­ton on Mon­day.</p>
    <p>Lam­pard has warned his side not to get dis­tracted by talk of revenge fol­low­ing their poor form against United.</p>
    <p>He said: “We’ve lost three, that’s just a fact, but I’m not into revenge, I just want to win the game.</p>
    <p>“They’re a good team, we can all see that, but I’m not overly con­cerned with the games that have gone by.</p>
    <p>“I just want to win the one in front of us.”</p>
    <p>Chelsea, also bat­tling United for a Cham­pi­ons League spot, must do with­out France’s World Cup win­ner N’Golo Kante.</p>
    <p>The mid­fielder re­mains side­lined with a ham­string in­jury, leav­ing Jorginho in the frame to sit at the base of mid­field again.</p>
