    <p>Di­nosaurs and the fly­ing rep­tiles called pterosaurs – both known for achiev­ing great size – had hum­ble be­gin­nings, as shown by a diminu­tive in­sect-eat­ing rep­tile from Mada­gas­car that was a fore­run­ner and close rel­a­tive of both groups.</p>
    <p>Sci­en­tists have de­scribed fos­sils of a Tri­as­sic Pe­riod crea­ture, called Kong­o­naphon kely, that mea­sured about 40cm long and stood 10cm tall at the hip. It in­hab­ited a flood­plain re­gion of what is now south­west­ern Mada­gas­car about 237 mil­lion years ago.</p>
    <p>Kong­o­naphon was a long-legged preda­tor that may have been bipedal. The shape of its small, con­i­cal and un­ser­rated teeth and an ex­am­i­na­tion of mi­crowear on them sug­gest that Kong­o­naphon, whose sci­en­tific name means “tiny bug slayer”, ate in­sects or other small in­ver­te­brates.</p>
    <p>It was a mem­ber of a group called Or­nithodira span­ning the evo­lu­tion­ary lin­eage that led to di­nosaurs and pterosaurs, part of a larger as­sem­blage called ar­chosaurs that also in­cluded the crocodil­ian lin­eage.</p>
    <p>“Based on sta­tis­ti­cal analy­ses of body size, we ar­gue that di­nosaurs and pterosaurs evolved from a minia­turised an­ces­tor,” said North Carolina Mu­seum of Nat­u­ral Sciences pa­le­on­tol­o­gist Chris­tian Kam­merer, the lead au­thor of the re­search pub­lished in the Pro­ceed­ings of the Na­tional Academy of Sciences.</p>
    <p>“Evo­lu­tion of gi­gan­tism from tiny an­ces­tors is not un­com­mon in the fos­sil record,” added study co-au­thor and pa­le­on­tol­o­gist John Flynn of the Amer­i­can Mu­seum of Nat­u­ral His­tory in New York.</p>
    <p>Di­nosaurs and pterosaurs first ap­peared roughly 230 mil­lion years ago. The early di­nosaur Her­rerasaurus was about 6m long. The early pterosaur Eudi­mor­phodon was pigeon-sized. Both groups eventually achieved gi­gan­tic pro­por­tions. The pterosaur Quet­zal­coatlus had a wing­span of about 10.5m, akin to an F-16 fighter. The di­nosaur Ar­genti­nosaurus reached about 35m long.</p>
    <p>In the con­text of this later gi­gan­tism, hav­ing an an­i­mal like Kong­o­naphon “that could fit into your hands seems al­most para­dox­i­cal”, Dr Kam­merer said.</p>
    <p>“How­ever, it fits the broader pat­tern that we ob­serve at this time. There was a sus­tained trend to­wards smaller adult body sizes in the early his­tory of this lin­eage. This is based not only on Kong­o­naphon, but also on a se­ries of small-bod­ied rep­tiles near the com­mon an­ces­try of the di­nosaur and pterosaur lin­eages.”</p>
