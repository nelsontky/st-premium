    <p>• In­dia’s farm­ers yes­ter­day re­jected the gov­ern­ment’s pro­posal to amend three con­tro­ver­sial laws and said they would step up protests seek­ing with­drawal of these laws that they said would harm their eco­nomic in­ter­ests while help­ing big food re­tail­ers.</p>
    <p>Farm­ers have been demon­strat­ing since late last month over re­forms en­acted in Septem­ber that loos­ened rules around the sale, pric­ing and stor­age of farm pro­duce. The rules had pro­tected farm­ers from an un­fet­tered free mar­ket for decades.</p>
    <p>“The farm­ers have re­jected the gov­ern­ment’s pro­pos­als,” Mr Dar­shan Pal, pres­i­dent of Kran­tikari Kisan Union, told re­porters af­ter the meet­ing of more than 30 farm­ers’ unions.</p>
    <p>Farm­ers’ lead­ers said they would in­ten­sify na­tion­wide protests from Satur­day, in­clud­ing boy­cotting lead­ers of Prime Min­is­ter Naren­dra Modi’s rul­ing Bharatiya Janata Party, block­ing of na­tional high­ways and pick­et­ing at toll plazas.</p>
    <p>Ex­press­ing their anger to­wards some large do­mes­tic cor­po­ra­tions and re­tail­ers, in­clud­ing Re­liance In­dus­tries and Adani En­ter­prises, the lead­ers said they would boy­cott the com­pa­nies.</p>
    <p>Most farm­ers be­lieve the new laws could pave the way for some of In­dia’s lead­ing cor­po­ra­tions to en­ter the In­dian agri­cul­ture trade, lead­ers said.</p>
    <p>Adani Group said the firm had no role in the di­rect pur­chase or sale of the farm pro­duce, and was hired by the gov­ern­ment only to store the pro­duce.</p>
    <p>Ear­lier, gov­ern­ment of­fi­cials had been look­ing for ways to tweak the laws lib­er­al­is­ing the agri­cul­tural sec­tor. Small grow­ers, in par­tic­u­lar, fear they will be at the mercy of big busi­ness if they are no longer as­sured of floor prices for sta­ples sold at gov­ern­ment-con­trolled whole­sale mar­kets.</p>
    <p>Un­happy with the new laws, farm­ers have set up protest camps and blocked roads, and on Tues­day mounted a na­tion­wide strike.</p>
    <p>Farm­ers’ lead­ers want the gov­ern­ment to re­tain manda­tory gov­ern­ment pur­chases, and said buy­ers at pri­vate mar­kets should pay the same tax as at state-run mar­kets.</p>
