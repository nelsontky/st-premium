    <p>Aries (March 21 - April 19)</p>
    <p>You are feel­ing good about your place in the world – or, if you feel out of sorts, you see a so­lu­tion. In­dulge your in­stinct to get things go­ing.</p>
    <p>Taurus (April 20 - May 20)</p>
    <p>Watch out for of­fers that seem too good to be true, be­cause they al­most cer­tainly are. Your in­nate scep­ti­cism should serve you well.</p>
    <p>Gemini (May 21 - June 20)</p>
    <p>Do not lay down the law or try to per­suade oth­ers – your en­ergy is too amped up to be taken se­ri­ously, but the right per­son will grav­i­tate to you.</p>
    <p>Can­cer (June 21 - July 22)</p>
    <p>Your so­cial life is get­ting in the way of your in­ner life, which may cause prob­lems. Try not to be grumpy, as things should re-bal­ance soon.</p>
    <p>Leo (July 23 - Aug 22)</p>
    <p>Some­thing small bugs you in a big way be­cause of the im­por­tance oth­ers at­tach to it. The pet­ti­ness is hard to be­lieve, but you will be fine.</p>
    <p>Virgo (Aug 23 - Sept 22)</p>
    <p>It is up to you to break the ice, so even if you are some­what in­tro­verted, you have to speak up or reach out to that one vi­tal per­son.</p>
    <p>Libra (Sept 23 - Oct 22)</p>
    <p>Your big ideas need more at­ten­tion and your in­tel­lec­tual en­ergy gives you the free­dom to ex­plore them. Take time to delve deeper.</p>
    <p>Scorpio (Oct 23 - Nov 21)</p>
    <p>Trust your gut even if signs point else­where. Your in­stincts are sharp and while things may be off-kil­ter, you can make the best of it.</p>
    <p>Sagittariu­s (Nov 22 - Dec 21)</p>
    <p>Your self-con­fi­dence is so strong, it is al­most over­pow­er­ing – so take advantage of it. You may find that more peo­ple will be­lieve your hype.</p>
    <p>Capricorn (Dec 22 - Jan 19) Per­se­vere. Things are about to turn around in a big way, but you can­not take advantage of the sit­u­a­tion with­out mo­men­tum.</p>
    <p>Aquarius (Jan 20 - Feb 18)</p>
    <p>Fo­cus on busi­ness ties, though it may help to ex­plore in­tel­lec­tual connection­s too. Make sure to spend time so­cial­is­ing or net­work­ing.</p>
    <p>Pisces (Feb 19 - March 20) Some­one is push­ing you hard, think­ing he knows best. Stand up to him, but be re­spect­ful, as this per­son al­most cer­tainly de­serves it.</p>
