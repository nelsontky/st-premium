    <p>What is es­sen­tial to a so­ci­ety in the throes of a pan­demic-in­duced lock­down?</p>
    <p>Bub­ble tea, it seems – at least for the hordes of Sin­ga­pore­ans who in April scram­bled for one “last” hit, af­ter it was an­nounced that stores sell­ing the sugar-laden con­coc­tion were “non-es­sen­tial” and had to be tem­po­rar­ily shut­tered as Sin­ga­pore en­tered its cir­cuit breaker.</p>
    <p>Es­sen­tial work­ers also came into the spot­light this year, with their role in the Covid-19 front line high­light­ing the stark dis­crep­ancy be­tween their value to so­ci­ety and what they earn.</p>
    <p>In early Fe­bru­ary, Health Min­is­ter Gan Kim Yong and then Na­tional Devel­op­ment Min­is­ter Lawrence Wong had high­lighted how es­sen­tial items such as masks should be pri­ori­tised for es­sen­tial ser­vices – “namely our front-line health­care work­ers”.</p>
    <p>A few days later, it was “es­sen­tial food/sup­plies” hog­ging head­lines as pan­icked Sin­ga­pore­ans emp­tied out su­per­mar­ket shelves in re­sponse to the na­tional Dis­ease Out­break Re­sponse Sys­tem Con­di­tion level be­ing di­alled up to or­ange.</p>
    <p>As the Gov­ern­ment as­sured cit­i­zens that there was no risk of food short­age, it also worked to sew up deals with other coun­tries in the months to come, to en­sure open trade lines and sup­ply chains for the flow of es­sen­tial goods.</p>
    <p>Travel for recre­ation was ruled non-es­sen­tial from the start, and Sin­ga­pore­ans had to moth­ball their usual jet-set­ting plans as bor­der re­stric­tions were put in place around the world.</p>
    <p>But with its air hub sta­tus crit­i­cal to its sur­vival, Sin­ga­pore grad­u­ally moved to en­able es­sen­tial busi­ness travel for se­lected coun­tries. Come next month, a spe­cial lane will open for all na­tions, with re­stric­tions in place for safety.</p>
    <p>Do­mes­ti­cally, cir­cuit breaker mea­sures from April to June for­bade peo­ple from leav­ing their homes ex­cept for es­sen­tial ac­tiv­i­ties and ex­er­cise.</p>
    <p>Only es­sen­tial ser­vices pro­vid­ing the likes of food and health­care were al­lowed to stay open dur­ing this pe­riod.</p>
    <p>The clo­sure of most work­places then has also since led to em­ploy­ees re­al­is­ing that their daily com­mute and phys­i­cal of­fice spa­ces are, per­haps, not so es­sen­tial af­ter all. Sur­veys show that most now pre­fer to work from home or have flex­i­ble ar­range­ments.</p>
    <p>Then Nom­i­nated Mem­ber of Par­lia­ment Wal­ter Th­e­seira made the point in Fe­bru­ary that Sin­ga­pore’s most vi­tal van­guard against Covid-19 – health­care work­ers,</p>
    <p>emer­gency re­spon­ders, clean­ers and se­cu­rity of­fi­cers – were be­ing paid salaries not com­men­su­rate with their so­ci­etal value.</p>
    <p>He urged the Gov­ern­ment to raise wages for them as well as for the pub­lic trans­port work­ers, hawkers and shop­keep­ers who keep Sin­ga­pore run­ning.</p>
    <p>As­so­ci­ate Pro­fes­sor Th­e­seira’s ob­ser­va­tions would con­tinue to take cen­tre stage in sub­se­quent Par­lia­ment ses­sions as the pan­demic wore on.</p>
    <p>The call to treat es­sen­tial work­ers bet­ter was also a key facet of de­bates com­par­ing the in­cum­bent pro­gres­sive wage model and the min­i­mum wage pro­posed by the Work­ers’ Party – whose MP Ja­mus Lim pointed to stud­ies show­ing that Sin­ga­pore­ans were pre­pared to pay more for es­sen­tial ser­vices.</p>
    <p>In a sur­vey of 1,000 re­spon­dents com­mis­sioned by The Straits Times in June, the ma­jor­ity said they now had more re­spect for es­sen­tial work­ers.</p>
    <p>Yet, only 17 per cent said they were more in­ter­ested in be­ing es­sen­tial work­ers now, or more open to their chil­dren tak­ing up such jobs.</p>
    <p>That same sur­vey saw “artist” deemed the most non-es­sen­tial job by re­spon­dents.</p>
    <p>The find­ing drew crit­i­cism and sparked dis­cus­sion about the role of Sin­ga­pore’s arts com­mu­nity, prompt­ing Milieu In­sight, the com­pany be­hind the poll, to re­it­er­ate that it was con­ducted in the con­text of the coro­n­avirus cri­sis.</p>
