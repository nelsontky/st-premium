    <p>WASH­ING­TON • Sen­a­tor Ka­mala Har­ris is a prom­i­nent es­tab­lish­ment Demo­crat with the qual­i­fi­ca­tions and her­itage which many be­lieve will hold her in good stead to ad­dress the is­sues of race and crim­i­nal jus­tice re­form in the US.</p>
    <p>The daugh­ter of In­dian and Ja­maican im­mi­grants, Ms Har­ris, 55, is the first black woman and the first Amer­i­can of In­dian de­scent to run on a ma­jor party’s pres­i­den­tial ticket.</p>
    <p>Should Mr Bi­den win, she will not only be the coun­try’s first fe­male vice-pres­i­dent from a mi­nor­ity race but also its first fe­male vice-pres­i­dent as well.</p>
    <p>Ob­servers note that her nom­i­na­tion stands in stark con­trast to the Repub­li­can Party, which is dou­bling down as a party that caters to white vot­ers, par­tic­u­larly men. Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump has of­ten been crit­i­cised for mak­ing com­ments that stoke racial di­vi­sions to shore up sup­port from his pre­dom­i­nantly white base, and alien­at­ing mi­nor­ity vot­ers in the process.</p>
    <p>EARLY LIFE</p>
    <p>Ms Har­ris’ mother, Ms Shya­mala Gopalan, was a civil rights ac­tivist and the daugh­ter of an In­dian diplo­mat from the state of Tamil Nadu. She moved to Berke­ley, Cal­i­for­nia to study in the 1960s, and met her hus­band Don­ald Har­ris, an eco­nom­ics stu­dent from Ja­maica, at civil rights protests on cam­pus. They have two daugh­ters, Ka­mala and her younger sis­ter, Maya.</p>
    <p>The cou­ple di­vorced when Ms Har­ris was seven, and Ms Gopalan, by then a breast can­cer re­searcher, raised her daugh­ters alone.</p>
    <p>Ms Har­ris fre­quently cites her mother, who died of can­cer in 2009, as hav­ing a deep in­flu­ence on her life and be­ing a force of na­ture, de­spite her small stature.</p>
    <p>Ms Gopalan, who was 1.52m tall, made sure her daugh­ters kept in touch with their black and In­dian her­itage, tak­ing them to a nearby black cul­tural cen­tre weekly, and on vis­its to In­dia and Ja­maica over the course of their child­hood.</p>
    <p>Ms Har­ris also ex­pe­ri­enced the tail end of the racial seg­re­ga­tion of schools as a young girl, re­count­ing the ex­pe­ri­ence dur­ing the Demo­cratic pres­i­den­tial de­bate in June last year, when she slammed Mr Bi­den for op­pos­ing bussing as a way of de­seg­re­ga­tion.</p>
    <p>“There was a lit­tle girl in Cal­i­for­nia who was part of the sec­ond class to in­te­grate her pub­lic schools and she was bussed to school ev­ery day. That lit­tle girl was me,” said Ms Har­ris, in the most elec­tric mo­ment of the de­bate.</p>
    <p>When she was 12, the fam­ily moved to Canada where Ms Har­ris’ mother had a job teach­ing at McGill Univer­sity.</p>
    <p>LAWYER-POLITI­CIAN</p>
    <p>Af­ter grad­u­at­ing from high school in Que­bec in 1981, she moved to Wash­ing­ton, DC to study at the his­tor­i­cally black Howard Univer­sity, where she chaired the eco­nom­ics so­ci­ety and protested against apartheid in South Africa dur­ing week­ends, a time she cred­its with shap­ing her world view.</p>
    <p>She grad­u­ated with a bach­e­lor’s de­gree in po­lit­i­cal science and aca­demics in 1986, and went on to get her law de­gree from the Univer­sity of Cal­i­for­nia, Hast­ings Col­lege of the Law in 1989.</p>
    <p>From 1990 to 2004, she worked as a pub­lic prose­cu­tor in Cal­i­for­nia be­fore be­ing elected as San Fran­cisco’s dis­trict at­tor­ney, be­com­ing Cal­i­for­nia’s first dis­trict at­tor­ney of a mi­nor­ity race.</p>
    <p>She was elected as Cal­i­for­nia’s At­tor­ney-Gen­eral – the first AfricanAme­r­i­can and Asian woman to hold the po­si­tion – in 2010, and was elected again for a sec­ond term in 2014.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing this time, she worked closely with Mr Bi­den’s late son Beau, who was At­tor­ney-Gen­eral of Delaware then, and be­came a fam­ily friend of the Bi­dens.</p>
    <p>The younger Mr Bi­den died of brain can­cer in 2015. More than a year later, Ms Har­ris spoke at the Cal­i­for­nia Demo­cratic Party’s con­ven­tion in 2016, prais­ing the el­der Mr Bi­den and his fam­ily as one that “truly rep­re­sents our na­tion’s high­est ideals, a pow­er­ful be­lief in the no­bil­ity of pub­lic ser­vice”.</p>
    <p>Ms Har­ris ran for Cal­i­for­nia’s empty Se­nate seat that year, en­dorsed by the then Vice-Pres­i­dent Bi­den and Pres­i­dent Barack Obama, and won.</p>
    <p>The sen­a­tor mar­ried entertainm­ent lawyer Dou­glas Emhoff in 2014, and is step­mother to his two adult chil­dren, Ella and Cole, from his pre­vi­ous mar­riage. They call her “Mo­mala”, a name she proudly dis­plays on her Twit­ter pro­file.</p>
    <p>TACK­LING RACISM</p>
    <p>Through­out the re­cent civil rights protests trig­gered by a white po­lice­man’s killing of Mr Ge­orge Floyd, an un­armed black man, Ms Har­ris has been a lead­ing voice in her party on tack­ling anti-black racism. She was in­stru­men­tal to the Democrats’ Jus­tice in Polic­ing Act, a Bill that banned no-knock raids and beefed up in­ves­ti­ga­tions into the ex­ces­sive use of force by po­lice­men.</p>
    <p>Ob­servers say that her ex­pe­ri­ence as a prose­cu­tor and as the top law en­force­ment of­fi­cer of Cal­i­for­nia, the most pop­u­lous US state, places her in a good po­si­tion to work on crim­i­nal jus­tice re­form from the White House.</p>
    <p>Her record, how­ever, is also a bit of a dou­ble-edged sword. Some pro­gres­sives are un­happy that she did not do more to pros­e­cute po­lice bru­tal­ity and in­ves­ti­gate po­lice shoot­ings dur­ing her time in of­fice, and crit­ics also ques­tion her poli­cies that led to higher rates of in­car­cer­a­tion among African Amer­i­cans.</p>
    <p>Her de­fend­ers have pushed back, ar­gu­ing that Ms Har­ris was pro­gres­sive for her time, and lim­ited in what she could re­al­is­ti­cally push for by the “tough on crime” po­lit­i­cal cli­mate of the 1990s and early into the mil­len­nium.</p>
    <p>In that re­gard, she is like Mr Bi­den, not em­braced by pro­gres­sives and seen as an ide­o­log­i­cally cen­tre-left can­di­date who can ap­peal to mod­er­ate vot­ers. This has not stopped the Trump cam­paign from paint­ing her as a “hard­core pro­gres­sive” who will “em­brace the rad­i­cal left”, in state­ments and an ad­ver­tise­ment on Tues­day.</p>
