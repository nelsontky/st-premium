    <p>SEOUL • South Korean ac­tor Oh Dal-su (left), who dropped out of act­ing in 2018 fol­low­ing al­le­ga­tions of sex­ual as­sault, is re­turn­ing to the big screen in Good Neigh­bour.</p>
    <p>The sex­ual as­sault claims sur­faced in Fe­bru­ary 2018 amid the #Me­Too move­ment in South Korea, and scenes fea­tur­ing Oh were sub­se­quently re­moved from tele­vi­sion se­ries My Mis­ter (2018) and hit film Along With The Gods: The Last 49 Days (2018).</p>
    <p>Film­ing for Good Neigh­bour was like­wise com­pleted in Fe­bru­ary 2018.</p>
    <p>Early last year, the po­lice closed the in­ves­ti­ga­tion due to in­suf­fi­cient ev­i­dence.</p>
    <p>“I came here with a heavy heart. I want to thank all the staff and ac­tors for their hard work two to three years ago,” Oh, 52, said at a press con­fer­ence held ahead of the re­lease of Good Neigh­bour in Seoul.</p>
    <p>In the up­com­ing film, agent Dae-kwon (Jung Woo) is tasked with watch­ing 24/7 over in­flu­en­tial op­po­si­tion party politi­cian Lee Eui-sik (Oh), who seems to have plans to run in the next pres­i­den­tial elec­tion, and his fam­ily.</p>
    <p>Dae-kwon moves into a house next door and slowly be­comes a neigh­bour close to the politi­cian and his fam­ily.</p>
    <p>“I am re­lieved that this movie could be re­leased. Like Lee in the movie, I have learnt the im­por­tance of fam­ily. I have been farm­ing on Geo­jedo and my fam­ily was there with me the whole time to pre­vent me from think­ing too much (of the scan­dal),” Oh said. “I have been liv­ing rou­tinely while wait­ing for this re­lease.”</p>
    <p>The di­rec­tor and other ac­tors tried to show their sup­port for Oh’s re­turn.</p>
    <p>“It has been seven years since my last movie Mir­a­cle In Cell No. 7 came out. I should have re­turned ear­lier and feel sorry to the au­di­ence and also ex­cited as well,” di­rec­tor Lee Hwan-kyung said, adding that he asked Oh to be at the press con­fer­ence with him for moral sup­port.</p>
    <p>Re­leased in 2013, Mir­a­cle In Cell No. 7 sold more than 12.81 mil­lion cin­ema tick­ets in South Korea.</p>
    <p>“I think Oh is like ra­men. You never get tired of him,” Lee said.</p>
    <p>“And if you don’t have ra­men for a while, out of wor­ries that it might make you put on weight, you soon crave it. He is like that and I love and re­spect him.”</p>
    <p>“I see that Oh played a cru­cial role in the Korean movie in­dus­try, and also, as a mem­ber of the au­di­ence I was glad and grate­ful to see him again on the big screen,” Jung said.</p>
    <p>The movie hits the­atres in South Korea next Wed­nes­day.</p>
