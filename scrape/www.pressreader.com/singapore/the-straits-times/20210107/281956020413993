    <p>A new vari­ant of the coro­n­avirus is spread­ing across the globe. It was first iden­ti­fied in Bri­tain, where it is rapidly spread­ing, and has been found in mul­ti­ple coun­tries.</p>
    <p>Viruses mu­tate all the time, of­ten with no im­pact, but this one ap­pears to be more trans­mis­si­ble than other vari­ants – mean­ing it spreads more eas­ily. Barely one day af­ter of­fi­cials an­nounced that Amer­ica’s first case of the vari­ant had been found in the United States, in a Colorado man with no his­tory of travel, an ad­di­tional case was found in Cal­i­for­nia.</p>
    <p>There are still many un­knowns, but much con­cern has fo­cused on whether this new vari­ant would throw off vac­cine ef­fi­cacy or cause more se­vere dis­ease – with some de­gree of re­lief af­ter an ini­tial study in­di­cated that it did not do ei­ther.</p>
    <p>And while we need more data to feel truly re­as­sured, many sci­en­tists be­lieve that this vari­ant will not de­crease vac­cine ef­fi­cacy much, if at all. Health of­fi­cials have started em­pha­sis­ing the lack of ev­i­dence for more se­vere dis­ease.</p>
    <p>All good and no cause for alarm, right? Wrong.</p>
    <p>A more trans­mis­si­ble vari­ant of the coro­n­avirus is a po­ten­tial catas­tro­phe in and of it­self.</p>
    <p>If any­thing, given the stage in the pan­demic we are at, a more trans­mis­si­ble vari­ant is in some ways much more dan­ger­ous than a more se­vere vari­ant. That’s be­cause higher trans­mis­si­bil­ity sub­jects us to a more con­ta­gious virus spread­ing with ex­po­nen­tial growth, whereas the risk from in­creased sever­ity would have in­creased in a lin­ear man­ner, af­fect­ing only those in­fected.</p>
    <p>UR­GENT AC­TION NEEDED</p>
    <p>In­creased trans­mis­si­bil­ity can wreak havoc in a very, very short time – es­pe­cially when we al­ready have un­con­trolled spread in much of the US. The short-term im­pli­ca­tions of all this are sig­nif­i­cant, and wor­thy of at­ten­tion, even as we await more clar­ity from data.</p>
    <p>In fact, lack of data and the threat of even faster ex­po­nen­tial growth ar­gue for more ur­gency of ac­tion. If and when more re­as­sur­ing data come in, re­lax­ing re­stric­tions will be eas­ier than un­do­ing the dam­age done by not hav­ing re­acted in time.</p>
    <p>To un­der­stand the dif­fer­ence be­tween ex­po­nen­tial and lin­ear risks, con­sider an ex­am­ple put forth by Dr Adam Kucharski, a pro­fes­sor at the Lon­don School of Hy­giene & Trop­i­cal Medicine who fo­cuses on math­e­mat­i­cal analy­ses of in­fec­tious dis­ease out­breaks.</p>
    <p>He com­pares a 50 per cent in­crease in virus lethal­ity with a 50 per cent in­crease in virus trans­mis­si­bil­ity. Take a virus re­pro­duc­tion rate of about 1.1 and an in­fec­tion fa­tal­ity risk of 0.8 per cent and imag­ine 10,000 ac­tive in­fec­tions – a plau­si­ble sce­nario for many Euro­pean ci­ties, as Dr Kucharski notes. As things stand, with those num­bers, we’d ex­pect 129 deaths in a month. If the fa­tal­ity rate in­creased by 50 per cent, that would lead to 193 deaths.</p>
    <p>In con­trast, a 50 per cent in­crease in trans­mis­si­bil­ity would lead to a whop­ping 978 deaths in just one month, as­sum­ing, in both sce­nar­ios, a six-day in­fec­tion-gen­er­a­tion time.</p>
    <p>BIG­GER THREAT TO SO­CI­ETY</p>
    <p>Trans­mis­si­bil­ity in­creases can quickly – very quickly – ex­pand the base­line: Each new in­fected per­son po­ten­tially in­fects many more peo­ple. Sever­ity in­creases af­fect only the in­fected per­son. That in­fec­tion is cer­tainly tragic, and this new vari­ant’s lack of in­crease in sever­ity or lethal­ity</p>
    <p>thank­fully means that the vari­ant is not a big­ger threat to the in­di­vid­ual who may get in­fected.</p>
    <p>It is, how­ever, a big­ger threat to so­ci­ety be­cause it can dra­mat­i­cally change the num­ber of in­fected peo­ple. To put it an­other way, a small per­cent­age of a very big num­ber can eas­ily be much, much big­ger than a big per­cent­age of a small num­ber.</p>
    <p>I dis­missed the news ini­tially be­cause viruses mu­tate all the time and there have been too many base­less “mu­tant-ninja virus” doom­say­ing head­lines this year. The ex­ag­ger­ated, click­baity alarmism makes it harder to dis­cern real threats from sen­sa­tion­al­ism.</p>
    <p>Given the con­stant re­al­ity of mu­ta­tion, ge­nomic vari­ants should be con­sid­ered in­no­cent un­til proved guilty. Even an in­crease in the proportion of cases at­trib­ut­able to a par­tic­u­lar vari­ant is not de­fin­i­tive proof of an evo­lu­tion­ary ad­van­tage. How­ever, as data on the new vari­ant roll in, there is cause for real con­cern.</p>
    <p>RAPID RISE IN IN­FEC­TIONS</p>
    <p>Dr Trevor Bed­ford, a sci­en­tist at the Fred Hutchin­son Can­cer Re­search Cen­tre and a board mem­ber for the Covid Track­ing Project at The At­lantic, points out that in­fec­tions from the new vari­ant are in­creas­ing very rapidly among the pop­u­la­tion in Bri­tain.</p>
    <p>He also notes that this new vari­ant seems to have a higher sec­ondary-at­tack rate – mean­ing the num­ber of peo­ple sub­se­quently in­fected by a known case – com­pared with the “reg­u­lar” coro­n­avirus.</p>
    <p>Fi­nally, the new vari­ant seems to re­sult in higher vi­ral loads (though this is harder to be sure about, as vi­ral loads can be af­fected by sam­pling bias and tim­ing).</p>
    <p>As Dr Kucharski told me, all of this does not rule out other ex­pla­na­tions. This in­creased trans­mis­sion could be due to chance or founder ef­fects – mean­ing one vari­ant just hap­pened to get some­where be­fore the other vari­ants and then got “lucky”; it was early, rather than more trans­mis­si­ble.</p>
    <p>It could be due to changed be­hav­iour among peo­ple – quar­an­tine fa­tigue, less mask­ing – lead­ing to more rapid spread.</p>
    <p>How­ever, given the cur­rent ev­i­dence, along with the specifics of the mu­ta­tion, it’s get­ting harder to as­sume that those other ex­pla­na­tions are more likely than the sim­ple propo­si­tion that this is truly a more trans­mis­si­ble vari­ant.</p>
    <p>TRANS­MIS­SI­BLE THE­O­RIES</p>
    <p>So how much more trans­mis­si­ble?</p>
    <p>We aren’t com­pletely sure yet, but the ini­tial es­ti­mates from the data sug­gest that this vari­ant could be about 50 per cent to 70 per cent more trans­mis­si­ble than the reg­u­lar coro­n­avirus. To make mat­ters thornier, we aren’t yet ex­actly sure why it’s more trans­mis­si­ble, though rea­son­able the­o­ries are al­ready be­ing tested.</p>
    <p>This vari­ant, now called B.1.1.7, has “an un­usu­ally large num­ber of ge­netic changes, par­tic­u­larly in the spike pro­tein”, which is how the virus gains en­try into our cells. The new vari­ant may be bet­ter at elud­ing our im­mune re­sponse and repli­cat­ing, or be able to bet­ter bind to lo­ca­tions in our body more con­ducive to in­fect­ing oth­ers, but that is all spec­u­la­tive for the mo­ment.</p>
    <p>This un­cer­tainty in un­der­stand­ing the vari­ant’s ex­act mech­a­nisms means that we don’t know if our ex­ist­ing tools – masks, so­cial dis­tanc­ing and dis­in­fect­ing – are as ef­fec­tive as they were com­pared with an iden­ti­cal sce­nario with the reg­u­lar vari­ant.</p>
    <p>To be clear: The vari­ant is still a res­pi­ra­tory virus, so the ba­sic tools will not change, and they will all con­tinue to work. In fact, they have be­come more im­por­tant, but we may need to be stricter – less time in­doors, bet­ter masks, bet­ter ven­ti­la­tion, more dis­in­fec­tion of high-touch sur­faces – to get the same bang for our pro­tec­tive buck. It may be a small dif­fer­ence, or not. We don’t know. We won’t know for a while.</p>
    <p>FLAT­TEN­ING CURVE AGAIN</p>
    <p>We can and should de­ploy what­ever weapons we have in our ar­se­nal, as soon as pos­si­ble. If pub­lic health of­fi­cials can ac­cel­er­ate our abil­ity to de­tect the new vari­ant, they must. “You could imag­ine case-based in­ter­ven­tions specif­i­cally tar­get­ing the early vari­ant-trans­mis­sion chains,” Dr Bed­ford told me. “I wouldn’t ex­pect to con­tain them, but I could imag­ine buy­ing a week or two.”</p>
    <p>This mo­ment is some­what sim­i­lar to Amer­ica’s ini­tial Covid-19 surge and shut­down in March. We need to once again talk about the im­por­tance of flat­ten­ing the curve. We need to again pre­serve hos­pi­tal ca­pac­ity, so our fa­tal­ity rate doesn’t in­crease. But this time around, we can be a lot more hope­ful: We need to flat­ten the curve be­cause de­lay­ing po­ten­tial in­fec­tions just a few weeks or a month can make a tre­men­dous dif­fer­ence when highly ef­fec­tive vac­cines are be­ing rolled out.</p>
    <p>We are in a race against time, and the virus ap­pears to be gain­ing an un­for­tu­nate abil­ity to sprint just as we get closer to the fin­ish line.</p>
    <p>Al­though the ini­tial roll-out of the vac­cines has been slow, it is ex­pected to in­crease rapidly. The US may have 50 mil­lion to</p>
    <p>100 mil­lion peo­ple vac­ci­nated as early as March. That is a huge dif­fer­ence, one that could save many lives, es­pe­cially since we also have per­haps that many peo­ple with some de­gree of post-in­fec­tion im­mu­nity.</p>
    <p>GET­TING MORE VAC­CI­NATED</p>
    <p>Here’s how to think about it: Vac­ci­nated peo­ple are a lot less likely to get sick in the first place. One hun­dred mil­lion vac­ci­nated peo­ple will mean 100 mil­lion peo­ple with much less (or hardly any) risk for any symp­to­matic Covid-19, es­pe­cially se­vere dis­ease. That’s an enor­mous gain. But that’s not all.</p>
    <p>Vac­cines ben­e­fit not just the vac­ci­nated, but po­ten­tially ev­ery­one else, too. Fewer peo­ple symp­tomat­i­cally sick with a con­ta­gious virus means fewer sick peo­ple in­fect­ing even more peo­ple.</p>
    <p>Ev­ery in­di­ca­tion we have sug­gests that vac­ci­nated peo­ple will also trans­mit less – how much less is still be­ing stud­ied, but the dif­fer­ence may well be sub­stan­tive.</p>
    <p>The mRNA vac­cines (both al­ready ap­proved in the US) cut down symp­to­matic dis­ease by about 95 per cent. We al­ready know that peo­ple who never de­velop symp­to­matic dis­ease are a lot less likely to trans­mit Covid-19. (Note the dif­fer­ence be­tween peo­ple who are truly asymp­to­matic and peo­ple who are just about to get sick – pre-symp­to­matic – but are highly in­fec­tious.)</p>
    <p>In a pre­lim­i­nary study, the Moderna vac­cine was found to even pre­vent two-thirds of asymp­to­matic in­fec­tions. Vac­ci­nated peo­ple are thus not only much, much less likely to get any dis­ease; they ap­pear much less likely to get even a silent, asymp­to­matic in­fec­tion. Al­though we need more data to be sure, all of this strongly sug­gests that vac­ci­nated peo­ple will also trans­mit less. The fewer peo­ple there are to ef­fi­ciently trans­mit a pathogen, the harder it is for that pathogen to spread.</p>
    <p>Now that we have ef­fec­tive vac­cines, flat­ten­ing the curve into the fu­ture also means oblit­er­at­ing the curve.</p>
    <p>Dr Dy­lan Mor­ris – a post-doc­tor­ate at UCLA who stud­ies virus trans­mis­sion and the quan­ti­ta­tive bi­ol­ogy of in­fec­tious dis­eases, and is co-au­thor of a pre-print pa­per study­ing the im­pact of tim­ing on non-phar­ma­ceu­ti­cal in­ter­ven­tions such as re­duc­ing mo­bil­ity and con­tacts, wear­ing masks, so­cial dis­tanc­ing, and avoid­ing in­door gath­er­ings – told me that “de­lay­ing cases has al­ways been valu­able, but right now it is es­pe­cially valu­able. Buy­ing even a bit of time to ramp up vac­ci­na­tion could avert a great deal of mor­tal­ity and mor­bid­ity”.</p>
    <p>Ev­ery Covid-19 death is tragic, but with the ex­is­tence of sev­eral ef­fec­tive vac­cines, ev­ery death is now tech­ni­cally pre­ventable too.</p>
    <p>RE­STRIC­TION AND SUP­PRES­SION</p>
    <p>Even with­out a vac­cine, Dr Mor­ris said, knock­ing down the virus through tem­po­rary sup­pres­sion can be valu­able even though the virus will grow again, pre­cisely be­cause of these ex­po­nen­tial ef­fects.</p>
    <p>The same per­cent­age growth amounts to a much smaller num­ber of in­fected peo­ple when the base­line num­ber is much smaller.</p>
    <p>Bring­ing the base­line level of con­ta­gion down also al­lows for safer ex­per­i­men­ta­tion: What hap­pens if we re­lax X a bit? What re­stric­tions work best? Which ones are most sus­tain­able? If cases are grow­ing from a very large base num­ber, how­ever, that means the state of the world is chang­ing very quickly, so small mis­takes are mag­ni­fied.</p>
    <p>As Dr Mor­ris said: “You can’t fi­nesse the steep part of an ex­po­nen­tial.”</p>
    <p>He noted that through­out the pan­demic, we be­moaned the ab­sence of sil­ver bul­lets while un­der­es­ti­mat­ing the value of crude ham­mers. But now we are in a dif­fer­ent sit­u­a­tion: We do have a sil­ver bul­let – vac­cines – just as we have this new threat thrown at us. How we re­act in the next few weeks will mat­ter im­mensely.</p>
    <p>Imag­ine it this way: There is a tsunami head­ing our way, and we are fer­ry­ing peo­ple to a high point. Ev­ery­one we trans­port up to the top is safe, but even bet­ter, they can also help other peo­ple get to safety (the ex­po­nen­tial de­sir­able ef­fect of the vac­cine).</p>
    <p>The re­v­erse is also true, how­ever: Ev­ery­one we leave be­hind also pulls down more peo­ple (the ex­po­nen­tial un­wanted ef­fect of in­creased trans­mis­si­bil­ity). And the whole process is very sen­si­tive to when we start; it’s much eas­ier in the be­gin­ning but gets nearly im­pos­si­ble as the wave grows higher and gets closer. With this vari­ant, at least in the US, we are likely at the be­gin­ning, or near the be­gin­ning.</p>
    <p>IM­POR­TANCE OF VAC­CINE ROLL-OUT</p>
    <p>All this means that the speed of the vac­cine roll-out is of enor­mous im­por­tance. There are al­ready wor­ri­some in­di­ca­tors of slow roll-out. Vac­ci­na­tion of a broad pop­u­la­tion, not vac­cines in and of them­selves, saves lives, and epi­demics are fought with lo­gis­tics and in­fra­struc­ture. We should put ev­ery bit of en­ergy, fund­ing and re­lent­less­ness into vac­ci­nat­ing as many peo­ple as pos­si­ble as quickly as pos­si­ble.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, the US was re­port­edly plan­ning to hold back half the vac­cine it has in freez­ers as a hedge against sup­ply chain is­sues, and some states may be slowed down by murky pri­ori­ti­sa­tion plans.</p>
    <p>Dr Scott Got­tlieb, the former US Food and Drug Ad­min­is­tra­tion (FDA) chief and a cur­rent board mem­ber of Pfizer, has ar­gued that the US should also go ahead with vac­ci­nat­ing as many peo­ple as pos­si­ble right now and trust that the sup­ply chain will be there for the booster.</p>
    <p>Re­searchers in Canada, where some prov­inces de­cided to vac­ci­nate now as much as pos­si­ble with­out hold­ing half in re­serve and will ad­min­is­ter the booster with fu­ture sup­plies, es­ti­mate that this type of front-load­ing can help “avert be­tween 34 per cent and 42 per cent more symp­to­matic coro­n­avirus in­fec­tions, com­pared with a strat­egy of keep­ing half the ship­ments in re­serve”. These were al­ready im­por­tant con­ver­sa­tions to have, but given the threat posed by this new vari­ant, they are even more ur­gent.</p>
    <p>NET POS­I­TIVE PRE­CAU­TIONS</p>
    <p>Maybe, just maybe, this vari­ant will turn out to be a false alarm, not nearly as trans­mis­si­ble as we feared. We will know soon enough. Our pre­cau­tions will still be net pos­i­tives. But if it is in­deed much more trans­mis­si­ble, we may face a true tragedy: ex­po­nen­tial growth with mas­sive num­bers of ill­nesses and deaths just as highly ef­fec­tive vac­cines are be­ing made available.</p>
    <p>We’ve had a year to learn about the im­por­tance of early ac­tion, of act­ing de­ci­sively even in the face of un­cer­tainty, of not con­fus­ing ab­sence of ev­i­dence with ev­i­dence of ab­sence.</p>
    <p>A year to learn to aim not for per­fec­tion in knowl­edge but for max­i­mal im­pact even while con­sid­er­ing the trade-offs. And, most im­por­tant, a year to learn to not wait when faced with threats with ex­po­nen­tial dy­nam­ics but to act as early and as de­ci­sively as we can – and to ad­just and tam­per later, if war­ranted.</p>
    <p>“Ex­po­nen­tials are so cruel that no­body wants to look them in the eye,” Dr Mor­ris told me.</p>
    <p>This is true, but avert­ing our eyes doesn’t avert the out­comes.</p>
    <p>Each one of us is now count­ing on ev­ery per­son who serves the pub­lic – may­ors, city coun­cil mem­bers, health of­fi­cials, nurses, FDA reg­u­la­tors, mem­bers of Congress, jour­nal­ists – to speak up now, and to speak up loudly. We must in­sist on swift and ag­gres­sive ac­tion, along with more re­sources, in or­der to get this right. It is not too late. Many lives de­pend on what we do next.</p>
    <p>Trans­mis­si­bil­ity in­creases can quickly – very quickly – ex­pand the base­line: Each new in­fected per­son po­ten­tially in­fects many more peo­ple. Sever­ity in­creases af­fect only the in­fected per­son. That in­fec­tion is cer­tainly tragic, and this new vari­ant’s lack of in­crease in sever­ity or lethal­ity thank­fully means that the vari­ant is not a big­ger threat to the in­di­vid­ual who may get in­fected.</p>
    <p>It is, how­ever, a big­ger threat to so­ci­ety be­cause it can dra­mat­i­cally change the num­ber of in­fected peo­ple.</p>
