    <p>My kailan plants (above) were grow­ing well, al­beit slowly. I trans­planted the seedlings in early June and the leaves have not grown to full size yet. But re­cently, yel­low streaks started ap­pear­ing on the leaves. The new leaves also looked dried out. I check the soil’s moisture and wa­ter the plants reg­u­larly. What could be the prob­lem?

    <p>Your plants are in­fested with the lar­vae of leaf min­ers. The adults are small fly­ing in­sects that lay eggs on leaves. Lar­vae that hatch bur­row into leaf tis­sues, lead­ing to the white tracks seen on the leaves.</p>
    <p>Leaf min­ers can be dif­fi­cult to con­trol. You may want to in­vest in a white fine net­ting that pre­vents the egg-lay­ing adults from reach­ing the plants. Or­ganic pes­ti­cides like neem oil are re­ported to have some re­pel­lent ef­fects.</p>
    <p>As for the slow growth of your plants, you have to feed them as they are in the ac­tive grow­ing stage and re­quire nu­tri­ents. En­sure that the plants are re­ceiv­ing enough direct sun­light as over­crowd­ing and shad­ing will slow the growth rate.</p>
    <p>Smaller plants can be picked first to give more space for the re­main­ing plants to reach full size.</p>
