    <p>Com­pa­nies that have re­mained ag­ile and in­vested in innovation have been able to pivot to new op­por­tu­ni­ties dur­ing the coro­n­avirus pan­demic, said Deputy Prime Min­is­ter Heng Swee Keat in a Face­book post.</p>
    <p>He made these re­marks after visit­ing pre­ci­sion engi­neer­ing com­pany Fore­front Med­i­cal Tech­nol­ogy on Wed­nes­day.</p>
    <p>The firm, which started in 2000, had been ac­tively ven­tur­ing into new busi­ness lines even be­fore the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>It was orig­i­nally fo­cused on mak­ing med­i­cal prod­ucts for drug de­liv­ery and re­s­pi­ra­tory care, such as la­ryn­geal masks, a med­i­cal de­vice used to keep a pa­tient’s air­way open dur­ing anaes­the­sia.</p>
    <p>But it also ven­tured into build­ing up au­to­ma­tion ca­pa­bil­i­ties, adding clean­room ca­pac­ity and grow­ing its lo­cal tal­ent pool.</p>
    <p>When the coro­n­avirus pan­demic struck, the com­pany ex­panded into man­u­fac­tur­ing prod­ucts for the di­ag­no­sis of Covid-19, in­clud­ing the pro­duc­tion of swabs.</p>
    <p>Fore­front Med­i­cal also hired 80 more staff to meet the in­crease in pro­duc­tion de­mand.</p>
    <p>Mr Heng said: “Even in the midst of the cri­sis, there are still pock­ets of growth. There are many other com­pa­nies like Fore­front Med­i­cal, which are grow­ing and hir­ing.”</p>
    <p>The firm now has about 170 peo­ple at the Sin­ga­pore plant.</p>
    <p>It also has lo­ca­tions in Shang­hai, Changzhou and Xi­a­men in China, Con­necti­cut in the United States and King­ton in Bri­tain. Glob­ally it has just over 1,000 peo­ple.</p>
    <p>Mr Heng added: “The J obs Growth In­cen­tive... will sup­port these com­pa­nies in in­creas­ing their lo­cal work­force, with more sup­port for our ma­ture work­ers. And we hope to bet­ter match job seek­ers to these new op­por­tu­ni­ties.”</p>
    <p>The $1 bil­lion in­cen­tive was an­nounced on Mon­day in Mr Heng’s min­is­te­rial state­ment on how the Gov­ern­ment will con­tinue to sup­port busi­nesses and work­ers. The scheme is aimed at boost­ing hir­ing of lo­cal work­ers, es­pe­cially the older ones.</p>
    <p>Firms that hire lo­cal work­ers over the next six months will re­ceive a sub­sidy of up to 25 per cent of their salaries for one year, sub­ject to a cap. This ap­plies to growth firms that meet the qual­i­fy­ing cri­te­ria. The co-pay­ment goes up to 50 per cent for work­ers aged 40 and above.</p>
    <p>Mr Heng said: “In this fast-chang­ing en­vi­ron­ment, all of us – busi­nesses, work­ers and gov­ern­ments – will have to re­main nim­ble and quickly adapt. We are in this to­gether, and by work­ing with one an­other, we can emerge from this cri­sis stronger.”</p>
    <p>Fore­front Med­i­cal pres­i­dent Wal­ter Tarca said: “We place to­tal em­pha­sis on innovation and con­tin­u­ous im­prove­ment... Our cus­tomers and their pa­tients ex­pect con­tin­u­ous im­prove­ment in cost and func­tion­al­ity… and we do ev­ery­thing we can to de­liver these im­prove­ments through great cus­tomer so­lu­tions and the high­est qual­ity med­i­cal de­vices pos­si­ble.”</p>
