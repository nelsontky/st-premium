    <p>As of Mon­day, Sin­ga­pore has tested more than one mil­lion swabs from around 520,000 peo­ple for Covid-19, and con­ducted about 177,000 swabs per mil­lion pop­u­la­tion – the high­est rate among Asean na­tions.</p>
    <p>As at July 13, Sin­ga­pore has tested over one mil­lion swabs from around 520,000 peo­ple for Covid-19.</p>
    <p>Based on data on the Min­istry of Health’s (MOH) web­site, about 143,000 swabs were tested be­tween July 6 and 13.</p>
    <p>Test­ing is one of Sin­ga­pore’s key strate­gies to con­tain the spread of the coro­n­avirus here, as it al­lows for the early de­tec­tion and ringfenc­ing of cases be­fore they in­fect oth­ers.</p>
    <p>Last month, Health Min­is­ter Gan Kim Yong said that the Re­pub­lic was ramp­ing up its test­ing ca­pac­ity and aim­ing to be able to con­duct 40,000 tests a day in the later part of the year.</p>
    <p>In or­der to reach this tar­get, four re­gional screen­ing cen­tres were opened at the Old Po­lice Academy, The Float @ Ma­rina Bay, Bukit Gom­bak Sports Hall and Bis­han Sports Hall that month.</p>
    <p>Plans were also an­nounced for a fifth cen­tre to be opened at 7 Be­dok North Street 2, the for­mer Sepak Takraw Sports Hall.</p>
    <p>While the Re­pub­lic is not adopt­ing the strat­egy of mass-test­ing its en­tire pop­u­la­tion at one go, the author­i­ties have re­peat­edly said that proac­tive screen­ing of tar­get groups, in­clud­ing the el­derly and health­care work­ers, will be car­ried out.</p>
    <p>Last month, about 600 swabs a day were taken from pa­tients with acute res­pi­ra­tory in­fec­tions.</p>
    <p>This month, the cri­te­ria for test­ing those with such in­fec­tions for Covid-19 were ex­panded to in­clude such pa­tients aged 13 and above.</p>
    <p>MOH also said on June 25 that it has plans to test front-line staff in­ter­act­ing with trav­ellers as Sin­ga­pore re­opens its bor­ders.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore has con­ducted about 177,000 swabs per mil­lion pop­u­la­tion as at July 13, the high­est rate among Asean na­tions.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to global sta­tis­tics site Worl­dome­ter, Brunei is sec­ond to Sin­ga­pore with about 68,000 tests per mil­lion pop­u­la­tion.</p>
    <p>Malaysia’ s test­ing rate is es­ti­mated to be roughly a third of that – about 26,000 tests per mil­lion pop­u­la­tion – while In­done­sia, one of the worst-hit coun­tries in the re­gion, has a rate of around just 4,000 tests per mil­lion pop­u­la­tion.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore’s test­ing rate is higher than that of the United States, which has con­ducted about 133,000 tests per mil­lion pop­u­la­tion, and just be­hind the United King­dom’s roughly 180,000 tests per mil­lion pop­u­la­tion.</p>
    <p>At the start of this month, Na­tional De­vel­op­ment Min­is­ter Lawrence Wong, who co-chairs the multi-min­istry task force tack­ling Covid-19 here, said that the lo­cal author­i­ties are now mov­ing in “a lot faster” when a case tests pos­i­tive.</p>
    <p>“(When) we know that there is a case, we im­me­di­ately go in to iden­tify a larger group that po­ten­tially might be close con­tacts, and we quickly test them and iso­late any po­ten­tially in­fected per­sons. That’s the new way of op­er­at­ing in this phase be­cause of our in­creased ca­pa­bil­i­ties in test­ing and trac­ing,” he said.</p>
    <p>He noted that those liv­ing here should ex­pect that more peo­ple will be no­ti­fied when a case is de­tected and that more peo­ple will be asked to go for test­ing as part of ef­forts to con­trol the virus.</p>
    <p>How­ever, Mr Wong added: “While we have this en­hanced test­ing and trac­ing ca­pa­bil­ity, I think we should not take it for granted that this sys­tem is fool­proof and we can catch every sin­gle case.</p>
    <p>“We should not push the sys­tem to its lim­its; we should not be tak­ing un­nec­es­sary risks.”</p>
