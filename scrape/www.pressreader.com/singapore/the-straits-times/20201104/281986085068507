    <p>The United Na­tions, its part­ners and the Philip­pine gov­ern­ment are as­sess­ing dam­age f rom deadly typhoon Goni, which is now mov­ing to­wards cen­tral Viet­nam.</p>
    <p>Goni, the Philip­pines’ 18th storm this year, is also the strong­est typhoon since Haiyan killed more than 6,300 peo­ple in the Philip­pines in 2013.</p>
    <p>Goni has left at least 20 peo­ple dead as it crossed the Philip­pines, in­clud­ing six on Catan­d­u­anes and 14 in nearby Al­bay prov­ince on Lu­zon, the au­thor­i­ties said.</p>
    <p>There has been ex­ten­sive flood­ing and dam­age to homes and in­fra­struc­ture in Catan­d­u­anes and Al­bay prov­inces, said the UN Of­fice for the Co­or­di­na­tion of Hu­man­i­tar­ian Af­fairs (OCHA).</p>
    <p>Mr Robert Kauf­man, coun­try head for the In­ter­na­tional Fed­er­a­tion of Red Cross and Red Cres­cent So­ci­eties, said yes­ter­day that it could take months to re­store power to the Catan­d­u­anes is­land of 260,000 peo­ple.</p>
    <p>Mak­ing mat­ters worse, in Al­bay prov­ince, home to the Mayon vol­cano, lava de­posits liq­ue­fied and streamed down­hill to bury at least 300 houses in Guin­batan.</p>
    <p>Non-gov­ern­ment agen­cies, civil so­ci­ety, UN agen­cies and church groups are con­duct­ing an assess­ment in Al­bay prov­ince fol­low­ing a re­quest by the lo­cal au­thor­i­ties. Some 18,000 farm­ers have been af­fected.</p>
    <p>In cen­tral Viet­nam, 300,000 homes have been flooded or dam­aged by a se­ries of storms since early last month, in­clud­ing typhoon Molave last week, which left 36 peo­ple dead and 46 oth­ers miss­ing. Now, Goni is ex­pected to be­come the 10th storm to hit Viet­nam this year, OCHA said.</p>
    <p>The UN over the week­end re­leased the Viet­nam floods re­sponse plan, call­ing for US$40 mil­lion (S$54 mil­lion) to help 177,000 of the most vul­ner­a­ble flood-af­fected peo­ple in the cen­tral prov­inces for the next six months.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, the Sin­ga­pore Red Cross said it would con­trib­ute $50,000 to the Philip­pine Red Cross to sup­port its disas­ter re­lief ef­forts for typhoon Goni.</p>
    <p>This comes on the back of the Sin­ga­pore Red Cross’ con­tri­bu­tion of US$75,000 in to­tal to Cam­bo­dia, Laos and Viet­nam on Oct 20.</p>
    <p>Mr Ben­jamin Wil­liam, sec­re­tary-gen­eral and chief ex­ec­u­tive of Sin­ga­pore Red Cross, said: “The suc­ces­sive ty­phoons and heavy rain have ex­ac­er­bated the al­ready­chal­leng­ing sit­u­a­tion caused by the on­go­ing Covid-19 pan­demic.</p>
    <p>“The sit­u­a­tion is ex­pected to worsen in the com­ing weeks and we must work to­gether to pre­vent this hu­man­i­tar­ian cri­sis from es­ca­lat­ing fur­ther.”</p>
    <p>The or­gan­i­sa­tion is also help­ing the af­fected ar­eas with short-term re­cov­ery projects such as the re­build­ing of toi­lets as well as liveli­hood sup­port for the vic­tims.</p>
    <p>The Sin­ga­pore Red Cross has ac­ti­vated its “Restor­ing Fam­ily Links” ser­vice to help Sin­ga­pore­ans and oth­ers lo­cate their im­me­di­ate fam­ily mem­bers who may have been af­fected by the disas­ter. They can e-mail rfl@red­cross.sg for as­sis­tance.</p>
