    <p>The Euro­pean Union an­nounced ad­di­tional fund­ing yes­ter­day to help vul­ner­a­ble mi­grants in Bos­nia and urged the gov­ern­ment there to re­build a camp that burned down.</p>
    <p>Brus­sels has de­nounced con­di­tions for mi­grants in Bos­nia, a can­di­date for EU mem­ber­ship, as “com­pletely un­ac­cept­able” and warned that lives are at risk.</p>
    <p>Fire en­gulfed the Lipa mi­grant cen­tre in north-western Bos­nia on Dec 23. There were no ca­su­al­ties but much of the in­fra­struc­ture was de­stroyed.</p>
    <p>The in­ci­dent deep­ened a cri­sis over where to house thousands of mi­grants, as the Bos­nian au­thor­i­ties have failed to find new ac­com­mo­da­tion for the newly home­less.</p>
    <p>In a state­ment, EU for­eign pol­icy chief Josep Bor­rell said Brus­sels was ready to add an­other €3.5 mil­lion (S$5.6 mil­lion) to its hu­man­i­tar­ian sup­port for Bos­nia.</p>
    <p>But he warned that 900 peo­ple were still ex­posed on the grounds of the de­stroyed camp, and that 800 more were without shel­ter in the re­gion.</p>
    <p>“The sit­u­a­tion in Una Sana can­ton is un­ac­cept­able. Win­ter-proof ac­com­mo­da­tions are a pre-req­ui­site for hu­mane liv­ing con­di­tions, which need to be en­sured at all times,” he said.</p>
    <p>“Lo­cal au­thor­i­ties need to make ex­ist­ing fa­cil­i­ties avail­able and pro­vide a tem­po­rary so­lu­tion un­til Lipa camp is re­built into a per­ma­nent fa­cil­ity.”</p>
    <p>On Satur­day, EU’s Spe­cial Rep­re­sen­ta­tive in Bos­nia and Herze­gov­ina Jo­hann Sat­tler said the liv­ing con­di­tions were “com­pletely un­ac­cept­able”.</p>
    <p>“Lives and ba­sic hu­man rights of many hun­dreds of peo­ple are se­ri­ously jeop­ar­dised,” he added, af­ter a meet­ing with Bos­nia’s Se­cu­rity Min­is­ter Selmo Cikotic.</p>
    <p>Po­lice be­lieve the Dec 23 blaze was started de­lib­er­ately by mi­grants stay­ing there to protest against the with­drawal of the United Na­tions’ In­ter­na­tional Or­gan­i­sa­tion for Mi­gra­tion (IOM), which had been run­ning the camp.</p>
    <p>The IOM left, com­plain­ing that the ac­com­mo­da­tion was not fit to house peo­ple dur­ing the cold win­ter months.</p>
    <p>Opened in April, the Lipa camp had never been hooked up with elec­tric­ity or run­ning wa­ter.</p>
    <p>Bos­nia lies on the so-called Balkans route used since 2018 by tens of thousands of mi­grants head­ing to­wards western Europe as they flee war and poverty in the Mid­dle East, Asia and Africa.</p>
    <p>The coun­try cur­rently hosts some 8,500 mi­grants.</p>
    <p>The Euro­pean Com­mis­sion, which fi­nances the run­ning of sev­eral mi­grant camps in Bos­nia, has called for an­other cen­tre in Bihac to be re­opened, but lo­cal and re­gional of­fi­cials op­pose the idea.</p>
    <p>That mi­grant cen­tre, in an aban­doned fac­tory, was closed in Oc­to­ber un­der pres­sure from lo­cal res­i­dents.</p>
    <p>In the very de­cen­tralised coun­try, the fed­eral gov­ern­ment has also sug­gested that the cen­tre, which could house 2,000 peo­ple, be re­opened.</p>
    <p>How­ever, it is not in a po­si­tion to or­der the lo­cal au­thor­i­ties to do so.</p>
    <p>In a bid to ease the mi­grant cri­sis, the Bos­nian gov­ern­ment has de­ployed the army to set up tents on the site of the burned-down cen­tre. But the mi­grants ap­pear un­will­ing to use them as they too are un­heated and without wa­ter.</p>
