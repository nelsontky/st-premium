    <p>WASH­ING­TON • A majority of US states have re­jected new Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion Covid-19 test­ing guid­ance in an extraordin­ary re­buke of the na­tion’s top agency for dis­ease preven­tion, ac­cord­ing to of­fi­cials at state health agen­cies and pub­lic state­ments re­viewed by Reuters.</p>
    <p>At least 33 states con­tinue to rec­om­mend test­ing peo­ple who have been ex­posed to Covid-19 and have no symp­toms, spurn­ing guid­ance pub­lished by the United States Cen­tres for Dis­ease Con­trol and Preven­tion (CDC) last week that said test­ing may be un­nec­es­sary.</p>
    <p>Six­teen states did not im­me­di­ately re­spond to re­quests for comment, and North Dakota said it had not made a de­ci­sion.</p>
    <p>Among the states break­ing with the fed­eral govern­ment are con­ser­va­tive-lean­ing Texas, Ok­la­homa and Ari­zona.</p>
    <p>Pub­lic health ex­perts said a rup­ture of this mag­ni­tude with the CDC may be un­prece­dented and shows deep­en­ing dis­trust of the Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion and its re­sponse to the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>“This is states al­most all-out re­belling against the new guide­lines,” said epi­demi­ol­ogy as­sis­tant pro­fes­sor Michael Mina of the Har­vard T.H. Chan School of Pub­lic Health.</p>
    <p>The CDC said last Mon­day that peo­ple ex­posed to Covid-19 but not symp­to­matic “do not nec­es­sar­ily need a test unless you are a vul­ner­a­ble in­di­vid­ual or your health­care provider or state or lo­cal pub­lic health of­fi­cials rec­om­mend you take one”.</p>
    <p>The CDC had pre­vi­ously rec­om­mended test­ing of all peo­ple who had close con­tact with some­one who was di­ag­nosed with Covid-19. That re­mains the pol­icy of at least 30 states.</p>
    <p>Some that have not changed pol­icy said they were study­ing the CDC guid­ance.</p>
    <p>Ad­mi­ral Brett Giroir, as­sis­tant sec­re­tary for health at the Depart­ment of Health and Hu­man Ser­vices, said in a statement to Reuters that the guid­ance “has been up­dated to re­flect cur­rent ev­i­dence and best pub­lic health prac­tices, and to fur­ther em­pha­sise us­ing CDC-ap­proved preven­tion strate­gies”.</p>
    <p>He said it places em­pha­sis on test­ing in­di­vid­u­als with symp­toms of Covid-19, those with sig­nif­i­cant ex­po­sure, and vul­ner­a­ble pop­u­la­tions, which in­cludes asymp­to­matic in­di­vid­u­als that lo­cal pub­lic health of­fi­cials choose to pri­ori­tise for test­ing.</p>
    <p>Some state lead­ers and pub­lic health ex­perts ac­cuse the ad­min­is­tra­tion of us­ing pol­i­tics rather than sci­ence to guide its re­sponse to the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>“This 180-de­gree re­ver­sal of Covid-19 test­ing guide­lines is reck­less and not based on sci­ence, and has the po­ten­tial to do long-term dam­age to the (CDC’s) rep­u­ta­tion,” New York Gover­nor An­drew Cuomo and the gov­er­nors of New Jersey and Con­necti­cut said in a statement, re­ject­ing the new CDC guid­ance.</p>
    <p>Adm Giroir said in a Wed­nes­day me­dia call that there was no po­lit­i­cal pres­sure from the ad­min­is­tra­tion. He said test­ing asymp­to­matic pa­tients too early could pro­duce false neg­a­tives and con­trib­ute to the spread of the virus.</p>
    <p>Dr David Bat­tinelli, chief med­i­cal of­fi­cer of North­well Health, ac­knowl­edged con­cerns over test­ing too early.</p>
    <p>“It is point­less to be tested for the five to seven days (af­ter in­fec­tion) be­cause you are not go­ing to be pos­i­tive,” he said. “There is an enor­mous amount of un­nec­es­sary test­ing go­ing on.”</p>
    <p>Idaho rec­om­mends that peo­ple ex­posed to Covid-19 con­tact their doc­tor to de­ter­mine if they need test­ing. It was among the states that did not re­spond to a re­quest for comment on the CDC guid­ance.</p>
    <p>Pub­lic health of­fi­cials be­lieve the US needs to test more fre­quently, that it is cru­cial to find asymp­to­matic Covid-19 car­ri­ers to slow the spread, and that the CDC’s com­ments could risk dis­cour­ag­ing nec­es­sary test­ing.</p>
    <p>Even be­fore the CDC guid­ance, the num­ber of coro­n­avirus tests be­ing con­ducted was on a de­cline.</p>
    <p>The US tested on av­er­age 675,000 peo­ple a day in the week that started on Aug 16, down from a peak of more than 800,000 peo­ple a day in late July.</p>
    <p>Na­tion­ally, cases have fallen for five weeks in a row, but in­fec­tions are surg­ing again in the Mid­west, with four states re­port­ing record one-day in­creases in cases last Thurs­day as the US death toll climbed above 180,000.</p>
