    <p>The Min­istry of Health had pre­vi­ously said those who left Sin­ga­pore from March 27 would be re­spon­si­ble for their own med­i­cal bills and would not be able to ac­cess gov­ern­ment sub­si­dies or in­surance cov­er­age if they should have Covid-19 symp­toms within 14 days of their re­turn here.</p>
    <p>Ex­cep­tions were made for those trav­el­ling on per­mit­ted ar­range­ments like green lanes, and for stu­dents trav­el­ling over­seas for full-time stud­ies.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore cit­i­zens, per­ma­nent res­i­dents (PRs) and long-term pass hold­ers who had trav­elled out of Sin­ga­pore on or af­ter March 27 can tap gov­ern­ment sub­si­dies and in­surance cov­er­age for treat­ment should they be found with the Covid-19 virus on their re­turn.</p>
    <p>This is in line with the move to pro­gres­sively re­open Sin­ga­pore’s bor­ders, the Min­istry of Health (MOH) said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>It had pre­vi­ously said those who left Sin­ga­pore from March 27 would be re­spon­si­ble for their own med­i­cal bills and would not be able to ac­cess gov­ern­ment sub­si­dies or in­surance cov­er­age if they should have Covid-19 symp­toms within 14 days of their re­turn here.</p>
    <p>Ex­cep­tions were made for those trav­el­ling on per­mit­ted ar­range­ments like green lanes, and for stu­dents trav­el­ling over­seas for full­time stud­ies.</p>
    <p>MOH also said yes­ter­day that Sin­ga­pore­ans, PRs and long-term pass hold­ers who had gone abroad be­fore March 27 will have their med­i­cal bills paid by the Gov­ern­ment should they be found with the virus when they re­turn here.</p>
    <p>It added that Sin­ga­pore has to grad­u­ally re­open its bor­ders fur­ther. “Un­like larger coun­tries which can keep their bor­ders closed, our liveli­hoods and eco­nomic sur­vival de­pend heav­ily on Sin­ga­pore be­ing open to the world and be­ing a key in­ter­na­tional and travel hub,” said the min­istry.</p>
    <p>“It is there­fore not pos­si­ble for Sin­ga­pore to keep our bor­ders closed in­def­i­nitely.”</p>
    <p>While trav­ellers from some coun­tries, such as China and New Zealand, can now en­ter Sin­ga­pore with­out spend­ing two weeks in iso­la­tion un­der spe­cial ar­range­ments, those from coun­tries deemed to have higher risks of Covid-19 in­fec­tion will be put in quar­an­tine for 14 days.</p>
    <p>MOH said it will look into more fre­quent test­ing and other safe­guards to let more trav­ellers into Sin­ga­pore with­out quar­an­tine.</p>
    <p>Ed­u­ca­tion Min­is­ter Lawrence Wong, who co-chairs the task force fight­ing the Covid-19 out­break, said at a brief­ing yes­ter­day that a pos­si­ble way around the quar­an­tine would be to re­quire trav­ellers to take a poly­merase chain re­ac­tion (PCR) test on ar­rival, and then un­dergo anti­gen tests later on dur­ing their time here.</p>
    <p>He said that for now, the PCR test will still be the re­quired test for in­com­ing trav­ellers. He had been asked whether the au­thor­i­ties would switch to rapid anti­gen test­ing to de­tect in­fected trav­ellers.</p>
    <p>Such tests can de­liver re­sults in 30 min­utes, but are less ac­cu­rate than PCR tests.</p>
    <p>MOH said yes­ter­day it will re­quire par­tic­i­pants of some mass events to take the anti­gen test and get a neg­a­tive re­sult be­fore ad­mis­sion.</p>
    <p>Health Min­is­ter Gan Kim Yong said at yes­ter­day’s brief­ing that any de­ci­sion on us­ing anti­gen tests on trav­ellers will de­pend on the re­sults of the tri­als for mass events.</p>
    <p>On whether Sin­ga­pore will re­con­sider its travel ar­range­ments with Malaysia in the light of the ris­ing num­ber of Covid-19 cases there, Mr Wong said Sin­ga­pore also mon­i­tors other data like the preva­lence of Covid-19 in­fec­tions among in­bound trav­ellers.</p>
    <p>“The as­sur­ance to ev­ery­one is that our travel ar­range­ments are not a free-for-all... Peo­ple do come in, but there is a sys­tem of stay-home no­tices, as well as test­ing, in place to en­sure they are safe be­fore they can come into the com­mu­nity.”</p>
