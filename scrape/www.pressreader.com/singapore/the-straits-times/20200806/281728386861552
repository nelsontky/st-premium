    <p>DUBLIN • Europe’s ex­per­i­ment in us­ing tech­nol­ogy to fight the coron­avirus has achieved some early suc­cess: Mil­lions of peo­ple have down­loaded smart­phone tracker apps and hun­dreds have up­loaded the re­sults of pos­i­tive Covid-19 tests.</p>
    <p>Yet, most Euro­pean coun­tries so far lack solid ev­i­dence that their apps – which iden­tify close con­tacts via Blue­tooth con­nec­tions with nearby users – are ac­tu­ally alert­ing peo­ple who may have caught the dis­ease be­fore they can in­fect oth­ers.</p>
    <p>The rea­son? De­sign choices made by gov­ern­ments and their app devel­op­ers to pro­tect peo­ple’s pri­vacy.</p>
    <p>In many of the 11 Euro­pean ter­ri­to­ries us­ing ar­chi­tec­ture de­signed by Al­pha­bet’s Google and Ap­ple, apps have been made to be “blind” to warn­ings of po­ten­tial ex­po­sure to Covid-19 flow­ing through the sys­tem.</p>
    <p>In Switzer­land, for ex­am­ple, the Fed­eral Of­fice of Pub­lic Health ac­knowl­edged that “the ef­fec­tive­ness of the Swis­sCovid App is dif­fi­cult to mea­sure be­cause of the ‘pri­vacy by de­sign’”.</p>
    <p>The weak­ness puz­zles some who have cham­pi­oned the apps. They point out that the Ap­ple-Google frame­work does al­low for some data col­lec­tion, while at the same time mak­ing it im­pos­si­ble for gov­ern­ments to stalk their own cit­i­zens.</p>
    <p>Dr Michael Veale, a lec­turer at Univer­sity Col­lege Lon­don, said: “I find it quite strange that many of the sys­tems are de­signed not to be able to mon­i­tor and eval­u­ate.”</p>
    <p>Ire­land, which uses the same stan­dard, is show­ing the ben­e­fits of be­ing a bit less pri­vacy-ob­sessed. Its Covid Tracker app, which has been down­loaded by 30 per cent of the pop­u­la­tion, tal­lies how many peo­ple up­load a pos­i­tive test re­sult and how many get no­ti­fi­ca­tions.</p>
    <p>Mr Colme Harte, tech­ni­cal di­rec­tor at soft­ware de­vel­op­ment firm NearForm, which cre­ated the app, said: “We’re see­ing the whole endto-end flow and suc­cess from that per­spec­tive.”</p>
    <p>A to­tal of 58 users reg­is­tered pos­i­tive tests in the app’s first three weeks of op­er­a­tion through to July 28, gen­er­at­ing 137 close-con­tact alerts. Of these, 129 opted to get a fol­low-up call from Ire­land’s con­tact trac­ing team.</p>
    <p>Else­where in Europe, the data is much sketchier.</p>
    <p>In re­ply to a Reuters in­quiry, Ger­many’s fed­eral agency for dis­ease con­trol, the Robert Koch In­sti­tute, said: “It is im­pos­si­ble to say how many peo­ple have re­ceived risk no­ti­fi­ca­tions.”</p>
    <p>This is be­cause check­ing for alerts is han­dled on in­di­vid­ual de­vices, an ap­proach called de­cen­tral­i­sa­tion.</p>
    <p>Ger­many’s Corona Warn App has been down­loaded more than 16 mil­lion times, though up­take has slowed since it emerged that some smart­phones were send­ing the app to sleep to save bat­tery.</p>
    <p>The prob­lem was soon fixed but prompted crit­i­cal me­dia cov­er­age.</p>
    <p>So far, 1,052 peo­ple who have tested pos­i­tive have been is­sued with one-time codes to up­load into the sys­tem, ac­cord­ing to weekly fig­ures from the Robert Koch In­sti­tute. But there is no way of know­ing if they ac­tu­ally did so.</p>
    <p>Other Euro­pean coun­tries, mean­while, are turn­ing to sur­veys as a work­around.</p>
    <p>In Den­mark, the Statens Serum In­sti­tute for in­fec­tious diseases last week pub­lished a sur­vey which found that 48 peo­ple had booked a Covid-19 test on­line af­ter get­ting risk warn­ings from the Smittestop app.</p>
    <p>“The app should work as a dig­i­tal sup­ple­ment to our ef­forts in in­fec­tion track­ing,” Health Min­is­ter Mag­nus He­u­nicke said. “It’s good news that we now also have fig­ures show­ing that the app works and helps to find un­known con­tacts.”</p>
