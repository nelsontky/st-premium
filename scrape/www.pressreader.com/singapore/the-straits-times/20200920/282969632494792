    <p>As the coro­n­avirus pan­demic drags on with no end in sight, peo­ple around the world are in­creas­ingly pin­ning their hopes on the idea that a vaccine will spell the end of this an­nus hor­ri­bilis and avert the hor­rors of 2020 spilling over into the com­ing year, al­low­ing peo­ple to ex­pe­ri­ence the world of BTS’ Dy­na­mite and not con­tinue into Or­wellian dystopia. Politi­cians are all too happy to stoke th­ese hopes. “I prom­ise you by the grace of God I hope by De­cem­ber we will be back to normal… let’s just wait for the vaccine. It’s al­most here,” Pres­i­dent Ro­drigo Duterte averred in one of his late-night ad­dresses.</p>
    <p>Re­cently, US Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump de­clared: “We’ll pro­duce a vaccine be­fore the end of the year, or maybe even sooner.”</p>
    <p>Tak­ing things to a higher level, Rus­sian Pres­i­dent Vladimir Putin has al­ready ap­proved a vaccine, waiv­ing the usual reg­u­la­tory re­quire­ments, although even the doc­tors in his own coun­try are scep­ti­cal.</p>
    <p>With very good rea­son: The vaccine de­vel­oped by Ga­ma­leya In­sti­tute has not even un­der­gone the req­ui­site large-scale clin­i­cal tri­als, which means we sim­ply don’t know if it is safe or ef­fec­tive.</p>
    <p>Th­ese pres­i­den­tial re­sponses are con­sis­tent with how lead­ers tend to re­spond in times of pan­demic.</p>
    <p>In my own re­search on “med­i­cal pop­ulism”, I found that sim­pli­fi­ca­tion and spec­tac­u­lar­i­sa­tion were two com­mon re­sponses by po­lit­i­cal ac­tors.</p>
    <p>Promis­ing a vaccine sim­pli­fies a com­plex cri­sis, while dub­bing your vaccine Sput­nik V or call­ing your vaccine project Op­er­a­tion Warp Speed makes a spec­ta­cle out of your lead­er­ship.</p>
    <p>Surely, if a vaccine be­comes avail­able, mass vac­ci­na­tion will like­wise be ac­com­pa­nied by pres­i­den­tial the­atrics.</p>
    <p>There is rea­son to hope that a vaccine may in­deed be de­vel­oped within the next 12 months (there are now at least nine vac­cines in phase 3 tri­als – the fi­nal step that in­volves large-scale tests for ef­fi­cacy).</p>
    <p>There is rea­son, too, to wel­come the po­lit­i­cal sup­port for vac­ci­na­tions, given the mas­sive re­sources needed for them, and the prece­dent-set­ting that may pave the way for sim­i­lar such ef­forts for tu­ber­cu­lo­sis, dengue, and other in­fec­tious diseases.</p>
    <p>How­ever, vaccine mes­sian­ism is dan­ger­ous for a num­ber of rea­sons.</p>
    <p>In the first place, there is no guar­an­tee that a vaccine will ac­tu­ally be avail­able, and how soon.</p>
    <p>Wait­ing for a vaccine de­tracts at­ten­tion from ex­ist­ing so­lu­tions that, when im­ple­mented prop­erly, can al­ready mit­i­gate the ef­fects of the pan­demic, in­clud­ing mas­sive rapid test­ing and com­pre­hen­sive con­tact trac­ing – steps that the med­i­cal com­mu­nity has long been de­mand­ing.</p>
    <p>In the sec­ond place, this sin­gu­lar at­ten­tion on a vaccine can cause un­due pres­sure on vaccine man­u­fac­tur­ers and reg­u­la­tory agen­cies alike, risk­ing a rushed treat­ment that, if proven to be un­safe or in­ef­fec­tive, could cause ir­repara­ble harm to pub­lic health.</p>
    <p>Al­ready, the US Food and Drug Ad­min­is­tra­tion’s will­ing­ness to ap­prove a vaccine be­fore the end of phase 3 tri­als is rais­ing alarm among pub­lic health ex­perts, who right­fully fear that such a rush could un­leash a pan­demic of anti-vaxxer sen­ti­ment not seen since An­drew Wake­field, the dis­graced Bri­tish doc­tor who fab­ri­cated ev­i­dence that showed a link be­tween the MMR (measles, mumps and rubella) vaccine and autism in young chil­dren, trig­ger­ing a world­wide panic about the safety of vac­ci­na­tion.</p>
    <p>Thirdly, vaccine mes­sian­ism can lead to a re­lated phe­nom­e­non the World Health Or­gan­i­sa­tion has warned about: vaccine na­tion­al­ism.</p>
    <p>Politi­cians’ pri­or­i­ties will doubt­less be their own cit­i­zens – al­ready, we are see­ing large coun­tries se­cure bil­lions of dol­lars’ worth of vaccine deals – po­ten­tially at the ex­pense of coun­tries like the Philip­pines, lead­ing to global in­equity.</p>
    <p>Fi­nally, left un­chal­lenged, vaccine mes­sian­ism can boost the po­lit­i­cal cap­i­tal – and longevity – of lead­ers whose failed re­sponses have caused pro­found mis­ery to their peo­ples.</p>
    <p>Mr Duterte, for in­stance, has over­seen the world’s long­est lock­down with lit­tle re­sult.</p>
    <p>De­spite Pres­i­dent Trump’s claims to the con­trary, he has down­played the pan­demic and un­der­mined a science-based re­sponse by pro­mot­ing false­hoods, con­tribut­ing to the United States be­ing among the coun­tries most dev­as­tated by Covid-19.</p>
    <p>Given the per­ils of vaccine mes­sian­ism, re­searchers and reg­u­la­tors alike should re­sist the pres­sure to take eth­i­cal and method­olog­i­cal short­cuts in vaccine de­vel­op­ment, while jour­nal­ists should chal­lenge vaccine-re­lated claims made by lead­ers and not sim­ply re­port them un­vet­ted.</p>
    <p>Just as im­por­tantly, the gen­eral pub­lic should hold lead­ers to ac­count for their prom­ises, de­mand­ing trans­parency and fair­ness in the so-called “vaccine race”.</p>
    <p>Vac­ci­na­tion may yet save the world from the pan­demic, but only if we save it from fur­ther politi­ci­sa­tion.</p>
