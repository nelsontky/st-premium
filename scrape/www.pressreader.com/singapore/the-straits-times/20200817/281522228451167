    <p>At least 10,000 protesters chant­ing “down with dic­ta­tor­ship” and “the coun­try be­longs to the peo­ple” joined an anti-govern­ment demon­stra­tion in Bangkok yes­ter­day, one of the big­gest since a 2014 coup.</p>
    <p>Stu­dent-led groups have held near-daily protests across Thai­land for the past month to de­nounce Prime Min­is­ter Prayut Chan-o-cha – a for­mer army chief who led the 2014 coup – and his mil­i­tary-aligned ad­min­is­tra­tion. The lat­est protests have also de­manded a new Con­sti­tu­tion, an end to ha­rass­ing op­po­si­tion ac­tivists and re­form of the monar­chy, a sen­si­tive sub­ject in a coun­try where the King is highly revered.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, a few dozen roy­al­ist sup­port­ers dressed in yel­low staged a counter-protest nearby, car­ry­ing por­traits of the King and Queen, and shout­ing “long live the King”.</p>
    <p>BANGKOK • Thai­land’s pro-democ­racy move­ment gath­ered steam in the cap­i­tal yes­ter­day, de­fy­ing the au­thor­i­ties who re­cently ar­rested ac­tivists and have threat­ened to de­tain more.</p>
    <p>The crowd, es­ti­mated by the po­lice to be at least 10,000-strong, swarmed the busy in­ter­sec­tion around Bangkok’s Democ­racy Mon­u­ment yes­ter­day af­ter­noon, and later cheered the ar­rival of prom­i­nent stu­dent leader Parit Chi­warak, who is out on bail after be­ing charged for sedi­tion.</p>
    <p>The po­lice say ar­rest war­rants have been is­sued for a fur­ther 12 protest lead­ers.</p>
    <p>The move­ment’s de­mands for the re­moval of Prime Min­is­ter Prayut Chan-o-cha’s ad­min­is­tra­tion, a new Con­sti­tu­tion and an end to ha­rass­ing op­po­si­tion ac­tivists have re­ceived wide­spread sup­port. Some stu­dents have also called for re­form of the monar­chy – once a taboo sub­ject.</p>
    <p>“We want a new elec­tion and a new Par­lia­ment from the peo­ple,” stu­dent ac­tivist Pat­salawalee Tanakitwi­boon­pon, 24, told the cheer­ing crowd at the Democ­racy Mon­u­ment. “Lastly, our dream is to have a monar­chy which is truly un­der the Con­sti­tu­tion.”</p>
    <p>The protesters, partly in­spired by the Hong Kong democ­racy move­ment, claim to be lead­er­less and have re­lied mostly on so­cial me­dia cam­paigns to draw sup­port across the coun­try.</p>
    <p>The hash­tags “Give a dead­line to dic­ta­tor­ship” and “Tag your friends to protest” started trend­ing early yes­ter­day on Twit­ter in Thai­land.</p>
    <p>Mr Prayut won elec­tions last year that the op­po­si­tion says were held un­der rules to en­sure that he kept power.</p>
    <p>The most vo­cal op­po­si­tion party was sub­se­quently banned.</p>
    <p>Anger has been fur­ther fu­elled by claims of cor­rup­tion, the ar­rest of stu­dent lead­ers over ear­lier protests and the eco­nomic fall­out from the coro­n­avirus out­break.</p>
    <p>Stu­dents have pre­sented 10 re­forms they seek to the monar­chy of King Maha Va­ji­ra­longkorn – in­clud­ing curb­ing his pow­ers over the Con­sti­tu­tion, the royal for­tune and the armed forces.</p>
    <p>Thai­land’s lese ma­jeste law sets a penalty of up to 15 years for crit­i­cis­ing the monar­chy, but Mr Prayut has said the King re­quested that it not be used for now.</p>
    <p>Near the anti-govern­ment protest site, sev­eral dozen roy­al­ists also demon­strated, wav­ing na­tional flags and hold­ing up gold­framed por­traits of the King.</p>
    <p>“I don’t care if they protest against the govern­ment but they can­not touch the monar­chy,” said Mr Sumet Trakul­woon­noo, a leader of the roy­al­ist group Co­or­di­na­tion Cen­tre of Vo­ca­tional Stu­dents for the Pro­tec­tion of Na­tional In­sti­tu­tions.</p>
    <p>Last Thursday, Mr Prayut said the protesters’ de­mands were un­ac­cept­able for the coun­try’s ma­jor­ity.</p>
    <p>He struck a more con­cil­ia­tory tone later, ap­peal­ing for unity and say­ing the “fu­ture be­longs to the young”.</p>
    <p>Be­fore the 2014 coup, Bangkok was roiled for more than a decade by of­ten vi­o­lent clashes be­tween “yel­low shirt” roy­al­ist protesters and ri­val “red shirts” loyal to for­mer prime min­is­ter Thaksin Shi­nawa­tra, but the new wave of protests has not been vi­o­lent so far.</p>
    <p>“I am old now and can never achieve my goal,” said for­mer red shirt Ueng Poontawee, 62.</p>
    <p>“Now there are new faces. I am very happy they came out.”</p>
