    <p>IAN ANG, 28</p>
    <p>Chief ex­ec­u­tive of Se­cret­lab</p>
    <p>Ugly? Cock­pit-like? Clunky?</p>
    <p>Yes to all the above. But how did jet-black, con­toured gam­ing chairs sud­denly make it to the top of Christ­mas wish lists and into stylish home of­fices?</p>
    <p>Sure, the pan­demic helped by spurring ex­po­nen­tial growth in video gam­ing and blur­ring the lines be­tween work and play spa­ces.</p>
    <p>As more were stay­ing in at home, toil­ing for long hours on their lap­tops, they started plump­ing for the full-body sup­port of er­gonomic gam­ing chairs.</p>
    <p>Enter Mr Ian Alexan­der Ang, chief ex­ec­u­tive of home-grown Se­cret­lab, who is in­tent on wheel­ing his gam­ing chairs to the fin­ish line.</p>
    <p>The 28-year-old is fo­cused on a sin­gle mantra: “Grow or die.”</p>
    <p>“For us, it’s al­ways ‘Day 1’ no mat­ter how big we be­come. We have to keep in­no­vat­ing and im­prov­ing or we will one day be­come ir­rel­e­vant, like many great gi­ants be­fore us.”</p>
    <p>He co-founded the com­pany with fel­low hard­core gamer Alaric Choo, 32, in 2014.</p>
    <p>Their dream then was to build the per­fect gam­ing chair that could cush­ion the body for up to 16 hours of con­tin­u­ous game play. Af­ter eight months of sketch­ing and at least 20 pro­to­types later, they fi­nalised the de­sign for their first er­gonomic gam­ing seat called the Throne V1 in 2015.</p>
    <p>Se­cret­lab has since re­fined the V1 to what is to­day’s Omega, Ti­tan and Ti­tan XL.</p>
    <p>The chairs are sold on­line and at the com­pany’s show­room in B-Cen­tral in Ben­de­meer in­dus­trial es­tate. They cost from about $500 for faux leather ver­sions to more than $1,000 for luxe napa leather it­er­a­tions, which have a fea­ture that tired gamers par­tic­u­larly ap­pre­ci­ate – a re­clin­ing mech­a­nism of up to 165 de­grees.</p>
    <p>Since then, Se­cret­lab has sold more than a mil­lion seats to cus­tomers from more than 60 coun­tries. Rev­enue this year is ex­pected to notch up over $350 mil­lion.</p>
    <p>Early last month, Mr Ang was awarded EY En­tre­pre­neur of The Year (EOY) by pro­fes­sional ser­vices or­gan­i­sa­tion EY, mak­ing him the youngest re­cip­i­ent of the award’s 18-year his­tory. He also bagged the EOY award in the Con­sumer Prod­ucts cat­e­gory in Septem­ber.</p>
    <p>These are just the lat­est in an im­pres­sive list of ac­com­plish­ments, which in­clude be­ing on the Forbes 30 Un­der 30 award in 2018 for re­tail and com­merce, nu­mer­ous mag­a­zines’ Editor’s Choice awards and be­ing named Hard­ware of the Year last year by PC Gamer magazine.</p>
    <p>Mr Ang and Mr Choo were also re­cently nom­i­nated for The Straits</p>
    <p>Times’ Sin­ga­porean of the Year 2020 award for their in­no­va­tion, en­trepreneur­ship and help­ing to put Sin­ga­pore on the map as one of the most highly rated gam­ingchair man­u­fac­tur­ers in the world.</p>
    <p>Mr Ang says that his team, which has grown to nearly 200 staff in the last six years, live and breathe de­sign, en­gi­neer­ing and er­gonomics.</p>
    <p>“We’re ob­sessed with ev­ery sin­gle de­tail that makes up the user ex­pe­ri­ence,” he says, adding that his chairs are put through rig­or­ous tests with cer­ti­fi­ca­tion bod­ies as well as the Agency for Sci­ence Tech­nol­ogy and Re­search.</p>
    <p>At the Se­cret­lab head­quar­ters in Ben­de­meer Road, the men in the hot seat have ditched the usual bor­ing cor­po­rate des­ig­na­tions.</p>
    <p>They draw from the hit HBO tele­vi­sion se­ries Game Of Thrones (2011 to last year): Mr Ang is “Pro­tec­tor of the North”, over­see­ing the com­pany’s op­er­a­tions, while co-founder Choo is “War­den of the North”, the com­pany’s chief strat­egy of­fi­cer.</p>
    <p>Mr Ang owns 70 per cent of the com­pany while Mr Choo has a 25 per cent stake.</p>
    <p>“For us, the one thing that won’t change is our fo­cus on user ex­pe­ri­ence,” says Mr Ang. “Whether it’s one, five or 10 years from now, we want to keep in­vest­ing in re­search and de­vel­op­ment and pour our soul into im­prov­ing ev­ery sin­gle as­pect of our prod­uct for our cus­tomers.</p>
    <p>“We want to do it right for them.”</p>
