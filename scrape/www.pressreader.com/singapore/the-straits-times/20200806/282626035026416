    <p>SEOUL • A mem­ber of South Korean boy group 2AM, Lim Seul-ong, was said to be in shock af­ter be­ing in­volved in a car ac­ci­dent that led to the death of a pedestrian last Satur­day night.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to South Korean me­dia re­ports, the pedestrian had been jay­walk­ing when he was hit by Lim’s car and later died from his in­juries.</p>
    <p>It was re­ported that the road where the ac­ci­dent took place had been slip­pery due to a torrential down­pour.</p>
    <p>The Seoul Seobu Po­lice Sta­tion said the 33-year-old was driv­ing his sport utility ve­hi­cle on a road in Eun­pyeong, Seoul, at 11.50pm on Satur­day when he hit a man who was cross­ing the road when the pedestrian sig­nal light was red, South Korean pop cul­ture news out­let Soompi re­ported.</p>
    <p>The man was taken to hos­pi­tal, but died shortly from his in­juries.</p>
    <p>The singer-ac­tor, who is known just as Seu­long, was ques­tioned briefly by the po­lice be­fore he was sent home. In­ves­ti­ga­tions are still on­go­ing.</p>
    <p>In a state­ment on Tues­day, Seu­long’s agency, Jel­ly­fish En­ter­tain­ment, ex­tended its con­do­lences to the fam­ily of the vic­tim and out­lined how the ac­ci­dent took place.</p>
    <p>“On Aug 1, Seu­long was driv­ing his car when the ac­ci­dent in the rain oc­curred.”</p>
    <p>It added that the singer “im­me­di­ately took emer­gency mea­sures on-site”.</p>
    <p>Seu­long, the agency added, is “in a state of shock” af­ter the ac­ci­dent. Some ne­ti­zens have tried to com­fort the singer by telling him that he was not at fault.</p>
    <p>He is part of four-mem­ber group 2AM, which de­buted in 2008, but has been on an in­def­i­nite hia­tus since 2015, when Seu­long and an­other mem­ber, Jeong Jin-woon, de­cided not to re­new their con­tracts with the group’s la­bel, JYP En­ter­tain­ment.</p>
