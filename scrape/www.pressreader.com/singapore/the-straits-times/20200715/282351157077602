    <p>NEW YORK • Manch­ester City have their an­swer: the an­swer they wanted, the an­swer they were adamant, right from the start, that was the only one pos­si­ble.</p>
    <p>There will be no two-year ban from the Cham­pi­ons League. There is no rea­son to worry that Pep Guardi­ola might seek new pastures ear­lier than ex­pected, or that Kevin de Bruyne or Ra­heem Ster­ling or any other mem­ber of City’s galaxy of stars will feel the urge to leave.</p>
    <p>All of those achieve­ments of the last decade stand, un­blem­ished. To City and their fans, that is what mat­ters.</p>
    <p>The Court of Ar­bi­tra­tion for</p>
    <p>Sport (CAS) on Mon­day cleared their name on ap­peal, strik­ing down the charge from Uefa that City mis­rep­re­sented some of their fi­nanc­ing to cir­cum­vent cost-con­trol rules.</p>
    <p>True, there might still be quib­bles, queries. Like whether a de­ter­mi­na­tion that the most se­ri­ous ac­cu­sa­tions against City fell out­side Uefa’s five-year statute of lim­i­ta­tions counts as to­tal ex­on­er­a­tion.</p>
    <p>Or if you can claim to be ex­on­er­ated as you pay a fine of</p>
    <p>€10 mil­lion (S$15.9 mil­lion). Or how what the club had said was a “com­pre­hen­sive body of ir­refutable proof” of their in­no­cence came down to Uefa not be­ing able to make its case.</p>
    <p>But for City, six years of skir­mish­ing with Uefa over its Fi­nan­cial Fair Play (FFP) reg­u­la­tions is at an end. They have their vic­tory.</p>
    <p>Any dis­sent to that or­tho­doxy will be dis­missed as sour grapes, bile pro­duced by bit­ter­ness. But the ram­i­fi­ca­tions were al­ways likely to ex­tend way be­yond the club at their cen­tre.</p>
    <p>If there will be no tan­gi­ble con­se­quences for City – carte blanche to back Guardi­ola, to build a dy­nasty, to ex­tend their em­pire of clubs – the same can­not be said for Euro­pean foot­ball more broadly.</p>
    <p>At first glance, it seems a lit­tle overblown to sug­gest this as an­other Bos­man mo­ment; the point at which the FFP ex­per­i­ment takes its last breath. Uefa, af­ter all, has em­pha­sised its com­mit­ment to its reg­u­la­tions.</p>
    <p>The prob­lem is that it is not just this in­stance. In Paris Saint-Ger­main, they have tried to pun­ish one of the con­ti­nent’s elite be­fore, but last year failed to bring the Qatari-owned French cham­pi­ons to heel.</p>
    <p>It has been un­done, again, by tech­ni­cal­i­ties. There has been no spec­tac­u­lar, con­clu­sive breach in FFP; just a se­ries of cracks, fa­tally un­der­min­ing the foun­da­tion.</p>
    <p>For the rich­est, most pow­er­ful clubs, the rules are start­ing to look a lot like guide­lines, and the im­pres­sion is that Uefa can­not uni­ver­sally en­force them, any­way.</p>
    <p>There is, now, pre­cious lit­tle in­cen­tive for any­one to ad­here to them. That such a blow should be de­liv­ered now is sig­nif­i­cant.</p>
    <p>An idea in­tro­duced al­most a decade ago to im­prove foot­ball’s fi­nan­cial health and to de­crease its reliance on debt has be­come a tool to en­trench the sta­tus quo, to lock lesser clubs out of the golden cir­cle.</p>
    <p>Uefa has al­ready agreed to sus­pend, tem­po­rar­ily, some of its cost-con­trol mea­sures, to al­low clubs to ride out the ef­fects of the coro­n­avirus pan­demic.</p>
    <p>If FFP is jet­ti­soned, if City’s vin­di­ca­tion proves to be its death knell, one ques­tion lingers: What comes next?</p>
    <p>It should not be a sur­prise that two of the clubs to take ad­van­tage of the re­lax­ation of the rules this sum­mer, Chelsea and PSG, have bene­fac­tors able to thrive in a world with­out fi­nan­cial reg­u­la­tion.</p>
    <p>City, mean­while, are plan­ning an over­haul of their squad. It will not come cheap but their Abu Dhabi own­ers have deep pock­ets.</p>
    <p>This mo­ment is a win­dow into what foot­ball’s land­scape might look like with­out fi­nan­cial con­trol: the teams with the most gen­er­ous own­ers bend­ing the mar­ket to their whim, cherry-pick­ing the poor, chal­leng­ing their ri­vals to match them or to sink into medi­ocrity.</p>
    <p>Per­haps that is as it should be: the strong ris­ing and the weak fall­ing and fad­ing. Ex­cept, of course, foot­ball has been there be­fore, in an age of un­re­strained spend­ing.</p>
    <p>At the start of the 2010s, Uefa found that Euro­pean foot­ball as a whole was US$1.9 bil­lion</p>
    <p>(S$2.65 bil­lion) in debt. The turn­around, over the last 10 years, has been re­mark­able. In 2017, the con­ti­nent’s clubs turned a profit of US$680 mil­lion. The change, of course, was the in­tro­duc­tion of FFP.</p>
    <p>That is foot­ball’s prob­lem: In­her­ently, un­apolo­get­i­cally tribal, it set­tles on the small an­swers and ig­nores the big ques­tions.</p>
    <p>In City’s eyes, FFP was de­signed, ex­clu­sively, to limit their am­bi­tions. In the eyes of English or Span­ish or Ital­ian fans, it was cre­ated to stop ar­riv­iste wealth from dis­tort­ing the sport’s eco­nom­ics.</p>
    <p>But else­where, it has proved cru­cial to en­sure clubs in smaller mar­kets – where the con­cerns are not who win the Cham­pi­ons League – meet their debts and obli­ga­tions by wield­ing the threat of ex­pul­sion from money-spin­ning Euro­pean com­pe­ti­tions.</p>
    <p>FFP has al­ways looked like a pa­per tiger to the big clubs; for smaller teams, it has had teeth. That is its weak­ness, but it is also its strength.</p>
    <p>What comes next for City? The sky is the limit. For much of the rest of Europe, the tra­jec­tory may be very dif­fer­ent.</p>
    <p>This mo­ment is a win­dow into what foot­ball’s land­scape might look like with­out fi­nan­cial con­trol: the teams with the most gen­er­ous own­ers bend­ing the mar­ket to their whim, cherry-pick­ing the poor, chal­leng­ing their ri­vals to match them or to sink into medi­ocrity.</p>
