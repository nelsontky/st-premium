    <p>More Sin­ga­pore­ans feel pos­i­tive about the pres­ence of for­eign­ers here rather than neg­a­tive, although such sen­ti­ments are in­flu­enced by one’s em­ploy­ment sta­tus, a poll by govern­ment feed­back unit Reach has found.</p>
    <p>About half of the more than 2,000 peo­ple sur­veyed said they were neu­tral about non-cit­i­zens in Sin­ga­pore, while 35 per cent felt pos­i­tive and just 14 per cent were neg­a­tive towards them.</p>
    <p>Those who were un­em­ployed were more likely to ex­press un­hap­pi­ness, with 26 per cent say­ing they felt neg­a­tive or very neg­a­tive about for­eign­ers here. Job-re­lated con­cerns about for­eign­ers were also more pro­nounced among this group, Reach said in re­leas­ing its re­sults yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The majority of those sur­veyed, or 63 per cent, agreed that it is im­por­tant for Sin­ga­pore to re­main open to for­eign­ers, with only 10 per cent dis­agree­ing and 25 per cent neu­tral. Re­spon­dents who were un­em­ployed were more likely to be neu­tral, at 34 per cent.</p>
    <p>The findings were based on a tele­phone poll of 2,100 ran­domly se­lected Sin­ga­pore cit­i­zens aged 15 and above in Au­gust.</p>
    <p>The is­sue of for­eign pro­fes­sion­als in Sin­ga­pore’s work­force has been a hot-but­ton topic, as ris­ing unem­ploy­ment and un­cer­tainty amid a re­ces­sion have fu­elled de­bate over dis­crim­i­na­tory hir­ing prac­tices.</p>
    <p>Man­power Min­is­ter Josephine Teo said in Par­lia­ment last month that 400 firms are on a Fair Con­sid­er­a­tion Frame­work watch list be­cause they may have en­gaged in such prac­tices.</p>
    <p>These com­pa­nies have an un­usu­ally high share of for­eign pro­fes­sion­als, man­agers, ex­ec­u­tives and tech­ni­cians com­pared with the rest in their in­dus­try, she noted.</p>
    <p>Un­til they im­prove, their work­pass ap­pli­ca­tions will be re­jected or held back as the Tri­par­tite Al­liance for Fair and Pro­gres­sive Em­ploy­ment Prac­tices helps them hire more Sin­ga­pore­ans, Mrs Teo said.</p>
    <p>Re­spon­dents in the Reach sur­vey were also pre­sented with an ope­nended ques­tion on the top three things that both­ered them most about for­eign­ers.</p>
    <p>Nearly half did not cite any, while 23 per cent men­tioned job-re­lated con­cerns and 16 per cent said they were both­ered by the so­cial habits of for­eign­ers, such as talk­ing loudly.</p>
    <p>A separate on­line poll of 1,050 Sin­ga­pore­ans found that the majority felt the coun­try’s sta­tus as a re­gional hub is ben­e­fi­cial for job cre­ation. But one in five said it would be bet­ter for the Repub­lic to do away with this sta­tus in or­der to re­duce the num­ber of for­eign­ers, even if this meant fewer job op­por­tu­ni­ties for Sin­ga­pore­ans. Re­spon­dents who were un­em­ployed were again more likely to in­di­cate this.</p>
    <p>Reach chair­man Tan Kiat How said in a state­ment that Sin­ga­pore­ans are un­der­stand­ably anx­ious over job se­cu­rity and ca­reer op­por­tu­ni­ties dur­ing this dif­fi­cult pe­riod.</p>
    <p>The Govern­ment is com­mit­ted to help­ing them keep their jobs or find new ones, said Mr Tan, who is Min­is­ter of State in the Prime Min­is­ter’s Of­fice and for Na­tional De­vel­op­ment.</p>
    <p>“Nev­er­the­less, it is heart­en­ing to know that many Sin­ga­pore­ans un­der­stand the need for Sin­ga­pore to re­main open to global tal­ent,” he said of the sur­vey findings.</p>
    <p>A spokesman for Reach said it reg­u­larly con­ducts sur­veys on top­ics that may be of in­ter­est to the pub­lic, and, in this in­stance, the sur­vey was meant to un­der­stand pub­lic sen­ti­ments towards for­eign­ers dur­ing this time of eco­nomic un­cer­tainty.</p>
    <p>Nev­er­the­less, it is heart­en­ing to know that many Sin­ga­pore­ans un­der­stand the need for Sin­ga­pore to re­main open to global tal­ent.’’</p>
    <p>MR TAN KIAT HOW, Min­is­ter of State in the Prime Min­is­ter’s Of­fice and for Na­tional De­vel­op­ment, who is also chair­man of Reach, on the sur­vey findings.</p>
    <p>When the Sin­ga­pore Govern­ment an­nounced in Au­gust another bil­lion-dol­lar round of sub­si­dies and in­cen­tives to pro­mote lo­cal hir­ing, Aus­tralian Paul Schmeja was elated.</p>
    <p>The 46-year-old, based here on an Em­ploy­ment Pass (EP), is chief ex­ec­u­tive of a com­pany ser­vic­ing cor­po­rate real es­tate. He says his aim is to em­ploy a 90 per cent lo­cal work­force by tap­ping cus­tomer ser­vice tal­ent re­cently dis­placed from the tourism and hos­pi­tal­ity in­dus­tries bat­tered by Covid-19.</p>
    <p>But a Bri­tish ship­ping pro­fes­sional, who wants to be known only as Tom, and has worked in Sin­ga­pore since 2010, took the news dif­fer­ently. He was dis­ap­pointed when, later that same month, Min­is­ter of State for Man­power and Ed­u­ca­tion Gan Siow Huang told Par­lia­ment that em­ploy­ers should give pref­er­ence to Sin­ga­porean job seek­ers, and where re­trench­ment was nec­es­sary, to “re­tain the Sin­ga­porean over the for­eigner”.</p>
    <p>Not minc­ing his words, Tom says: “The mes­sage the Govern­ment is send­ing to peo­ple like me is, it doesn’t mat­ter how long you’ve been here, or how much tax you’ve paid; when things aren’t go­ing well, we’re just go­ing to (let you go).</p>
    <p>“If I leave, it’ll be be­cause Sin­ga­pore has be­come a coun­try that’s not wel­com­ing any­more.”</p>
    <p>Speak­ing i n Par­lia­ment last month, Prime Min­is­ter Lee Hsien Loong urged cau­tion against giv­ing “the wrong im­pres­sion that we are now clos­ing up and no longer wel­com­ing for­eign­ers”.</p>
    <p>Cabi­net min­is­ters have fol­lowed his lead in re­cent times, es­pous­ing the im­por­tance of Sin­ga­pore re­main­ing open and con­nected.</p>
    <p>Ear­lier this month, Trade and In­dus­try Min­is­ter Chan Chun Sing stressed Sin­ga­pore’s com­mit­ment to at­tract­ing busi­nesses and tal­ent to join “Team Sin­ga­pore”, and pro­vid­ing a “busi­ness-friendly” en­vi­ron­ment for them to op­er­ate in.</p>
    <p>A Min­istry of Man­power (MOM) spokesman says the Govern­ment val­ues the con­tri­bu­tions of for­eign work­ers, as they “com­ple­ment the lo­cal work­force in keep­ing Sin­ga­pore an at­trac­tive host to in­vestors from around the world”.</p>
    <p>In­sight spoke to 15 ex­pa­tri­ates based in Sin­ga­pore to see if they still feel wel­come.</p>
    <p>Most re­quested anonymity for fear of hurt­ing their em­ploy­ment chances, jeop­ar­dis­ing ap­pli­ca­tions for per­ma­nent res­i­dency or hav­ing their fam­i­lies doxxed.</p>
    <p>BAL­ANC­ING ACT</p>
    <p>Faced with a pan­demic-in­duced re­ces­sion – the coun­try’s worst since in­de­pen­dence – the Govern­ment has moved to pre­serve what it calls its “Sin­ga­porean core”, in part by in­creas­ing bar­ri­ers to en­try for for­eign­ers to find work here.</p>
    <p>These mea­sures, cou­pled with anti-for­eigner rhetoric on­line, led to West­ern me­dia out­lets Fi­nan­cial Times and Bloomberg con­clud­ing ear­lier this month that the “lure of the dream” ex­pa­tri­ate life in Sin­ga­pore had “faded”, and that for­eign­ers were now spend­ing “a lot of time look­ing over their shoul­ders”.</p>
    <p>Tom cites an ex­am­ple that while vol­un­teer­ing as a coun­sel­lor, he re­cently en­coun­tered three clients who asked why he was “tak­ing a Sin­ga­porean’s job” – even though this was a pro bono role.</p>
    <p>Oth­ers re­late what they per­ceived as re­cent in­stances of mi­cro-ag­gres­sion, such as Grab driv­ers ask­ing ques­tions on their im­mi­gra­tion plans.</p>
    <p>But a good num­ber also say that Sin­ga­pore­ans over­all have re­mained friendly.</p>
    <p>“I’ve found Sin­ga­pore has al­ways em­braced ex­pats as a part of the fab­ric of so­ci­ety,” says Mr Schmeja, who is mar­ried to a Sin­ga­porean.</p>
    <p>Still, the ex­pa­tri­ates say anti-for­eigner sen­ti­ment has al­ways been bub­bling un­der the sur­face in Sin­ga­pore, and was brought to the fore dur­ing Covid-19 – pri­mar­ily by a case in May of ex­pa­tri­ates flout­ing lock­down rules by drink­ing and min­gling openly at Robert­son Quay. They point to the so­cial me­dia out­pour­ing of opin­ion that fol­lowed, with com­ments ze­ro­ing in on the ex­pa­tri­ate iden­ti­ties, ac­cus­ing of­fi­cials of “dou­ble stan­dards” and de­mand­ing the vi­o­la­tors be kicked out of the coun­try.</p>
    <p>Then came the gen­eral elec­tion in July, and with a down­turn loom­ing large, sev­eral po­lit­i­cal par­ties turned their at­ten­tion to the fal­ter­ing econ­omy and pres­sure on jobs.</p>
    <p>A key plank of the op­po­si­tion Sin­ga­pore Demo­cratic Party’s cam­paign nar­ra­tive read: “No to 10 mil­lion pop­u­la­tion – Don’t al­low more for­eign­ers to come in to com­pete for our jobs.”</p>
    <p>In a live tele­vised de­bate be­tween can­di­dates from four par­ties con­test­ing the most seats at the polls, For­eign Min­is­ter Vi­vian Balakr­ish­nan said “the only rea­son we have for­eign­ers here is to give an ex­tra wind in our sails when the op­por­tu­nity is there... Now we are in a storm, and we need to shed bal­last”. The next day, Man­power Min­is­ter Josephine Teo de­scribed for­eign work­ers as serv­ing as a “buf­fer” in un­cer­tain times, which em­ploy­ers might shed first when busi­ness con­di­tions worsen.</p>
    <p>It was later an­nounced that for­eign em­ploy­ment had fallen by 5.7 per cent in the first half of this year, com­pared with 2.7 per cent for Sin­ga­pore­ans, with 60,000 for­eign­ers los­ing their jobs in the same pe­riod.</p>
    <p>In the lat­ter half of the year, amid steadily ris­ing re­trench­ments and the job­less rate climb­ing to its high­est in over a decade, fi­nan­cial in­sti­tu­tions came un­der scru­tiny for their work­force com­po­si­tion, fu­elled by on­line chat­ter and claims of top man­age­ment po­si­tions be­ing dom­i­nated by for­eign­ers.</p>
    <p>The Govern­ment said in Au­gust that non-Sin­ga­pore­ans made up 57 per cent of se­nior roles in the fi­nan­cial sec­tor. That same month, it put 47 com­pa­nies on a watch list for pos­si­bly pre-se­lect­ing for­eign­ers for jobs; raised the qual­i­fy­ing salaries for for­eign work passes for the sec­ond time this year; and ex­panded wage sub­sidy schemes for lo­cal work­ers.</p>
    <p>Fran­cis (not his real name), an ex­pa­tri­ate run­ning an off­shore com­pany in Sin­ga­pore for eight years, thinks these mea­sures are “cross­ing the line a bit in terms of in­ter­fer­ing in pri­vate com­pa­nies”.</p>
    <p>“Although – and even though I’m po­ten­tially on the re­ceiv­ing end – I re­spect the fact that Sin­ga­pore has a hard line, and that they have to look af­ter their own peo­ple first,” he says. But he adds: “I also think it’s more po­lit­i­cally mo­ti­vated than try­ing to solve prob­lems.”</p>
    <p>As­so­ci­ate Professor Leong Chan</p>
    <p>Hoong of the Sin­ga­pore Univer­sity of So­cial Sci­ences points out that it is both a mat­ter of po­lit­i­cal sur­vival as well as so­cial co­he­sion and not making Sin­ga­pore­ans feel marginalis­ed.</p>
    <p>“You can never please every­body, so some groups will feel up­set,” he notes.</p>
    <p>“To them, these poli­cies might nat­u­rally give the im­pres­sion of be­ing un­wel­com­ing, dis­crim­i­na­tory and bi­ased. So the ques­tion is, what will be the po­lit­i­cal price?</p>
    <p>“Given that these are not your res­i­dents, the choice is quite straight­for­ward.”</p>
    <p>‘IN­WARD LOOK­ING’</p>
    <p>This year, Sin­ga­pore’s to­tal pop­u­la­tion shrank for the first time in the last decade, mainly due to de­clin­ing for­eign em­ploy­ment num­bers in the ser­vice sec­tor.</p>
    <p>MOM data shows there were nearly 750,000 for­eign work-pass hold­ers in Sin­ga­pore (ex­clud­ing do­mes­tic helpers and low-wage work­ers in the con­struc­tion, ma­rine and process sec­tors) in June, down from al­most 800,000 in De­cem­ber last year.</p>
    <p>Ex­pa­tri­ates re­counted to In­sight their strug­gles grap­pling with re­trench­ment and try­ing to ei­ther fly home or se­cure new jobs here. For the lat­ter, sev­eral spoke of in­ter­views that went well, only to end with em­ploy­ers openly stat­ing that they would have to “think twice about hir­ing a for­eigner, be­cause of the way things are at the mo­ment”.</p>
    <p>For Tom, this fac­tor has sat at the back of his mind when go­ing for in­ter­views.</p>
    <p>“There’s the pos­si­bil­ity that (the job) just gets pulled away from you, for no other rea­son than not be­ing Sin­ga­porean,” he says.</p>
    <p>A South Korean con­sul­tant on an EP here, who wants to be known only as Kim, thinks this could make chang­ing jobs a bit more dif­fi­cult.</p>
    <p>Tom warns that the per­cep­tion of Sin­ga­pore be­com­ing more iso­lated and in­ward-look­ing has al­ready taken root.</p>
    <p>“I know three com­pa­nies which were look­ing at shift­ing to Sin­ga­pore, then this all started... and they be­gan won­der­ing if they re­ally wanted to go to a coun­try that’s go­ing to have so many re­stric­tions in terms of em­ploy­ment,” he says.</p>
    <p>“They de­cided to go to Shang­hai in­stead.”</p>
    <p>But Mr David Kelly, ex­ec­u­tive di­rec­tor of the Bri­tish Cham­ber of Com­merce Sin­ga­pore, says its mem­bers re­main con­fi­dent here, with its lat­est polls show­ing that al­most 80 per cent have no in­ten­tion of re­lo­cat­ing any part of their busi­ness.</p>
    <p>Says Prof Leong: “The larger pic­ture is that we’re in a global re­ces­sion. And no mat­ter where you go, a tight­en­ing of im­mi­gra­tion quota is hap­pen­ing, even in tra­di­tion­ally im­mi­grant so­ci­eties like Canada.</p>
    <p>“Given the fact that no­body can give us a very clear idea when the re­ces­sion could be over, with that un­cer­tainty in mind, it’ll be chal­leng­ing for any po­lit­i­cal lead­er­ship to say that they are hav­ing a very open-door pol­icy.”</p>
    <p>Dr Mathew Mathews from the In­sti­tute of Pol­icy Stud­ies at the Na­tional Univer­sity of Sin­ga­pore notes that the coun­try has al­ways been open to peo­ple who can con­trib­ute to its de­vel­op­ment.</p>
    <p>“It’s im­por­tant that the pub­lic un­der­stands that there are poli­cies in place to en­sure that ex­pats here are in po­si­tions which ul­ti­mately can con­trib­ute to the over­all goal of job cre­ation,” he says.</p>
    <p>ADDED PER­SPEC­TIVE</p>
    <p>The ex­pa­tri­ate run­ning an off­shore com­pany, Fran­cis, be­lieves that for­eign work­ers, per­haps more so than oth­ers, are well aware of the fact that they have to give back and do some­thing for Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>“It’s not all take, take, take for those here – most work hard to con­trib­ute,” he says.</p>
    <p>The fa­ther of one adds: “The ones who got here have passed through quite a few hoops in the first place. They’ve put a lot into their ca­reers their en­tire lives, and they’ve got a lot of ex­pe­ri­ence and re­spon­si­bil­i­ties. Many of them are above-av­er­age to have even got here.”</p>
    <p>Even then, be­ing an ex­pa­tri­ate is by no means a risk-free en­deav­our, he notes.</p>
    <p>“If an EP is can­celled, we have to be gone in 30 days. We don’t have that se­cu­rity,” he says.</p>
    <p>“We ac­tu­ally got re­jected for PR, so I think re­al­is­ti­cally we can’t be here long term, and it makes it dif­fi­cult when we put our chil­dren in schools, or when we plan our ca­reers. We have a lit­tle bit of in­sta­bil­ity which Sin­ga­pore­ans would never have.”</p>
    <p>Prof Leong sug­gests a “more hu­mane” way of manag­ing the work­pass process for the Govern­ment to con­sider tak­ing up.</p>
    <p>“For ex­am­ple, you can give a slightly longer visa. So af­ter be­ing laid off, in­stead of the usual two weeks or one month, they can ex­tend to two months or even three months, so that you can help them ease into de­cid­ing if they can af­ford to stay in Sin­ga­pore as a non-em­ployed non-res­i­dent or choose to go back,” he says.</p>
    <p>A Bangladesh­i an­a­lyst, who wants to be known only as Manas, says the pre­car­i­ous na­ture of be­ing an ex­pa­tri­ate pales in com­par­i­son to the po­ten­tial con­cerns he could face back in his home coun­try, which re­mains one of the poor­est in the world.</p>
    <p>“In terms of so­cial se­cu­rity and job op­por­tu­ni­ties, com­ing from that re­al­ity, Sin­ga­pore is a way bet­ter place to try and build your fu­ture,” says the 25-year-old EP holder. “Even if it’s not Sin­ga­pore, I would still not want to go back to where I came from.</p>
    <p>“Maybe I’ll look for some other coun­try to set­tle in, where im­mi­gra­tion laws might be a lit­tle eas­ier or less com­pet­i­tive.”</p>
    <p>Other ex­pa­tri­ates spoke of a sim­i­lar need for per­spec­tive when it comes to the lo­cal-for­eigner di­vide in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>“Here, when peo­ple com­plain about for­eign­ers, they com­plain that they can­not get the highly paid jobs they want,” says Markus (not his real name), a Ger­man pro­fes­sional who has worked in Sin­ga­pore for eight years.</p>
    <p>“In Ger­many, when peo­ple com­plain about for­eign­ers, they are com­plain­ing about crime – there are for­eign­ers who are crim­i­nals who steal, rape, rob and deal drugs.”</p>
    <p>Says Tom: “Sin­ga­pore­ans, in gen­eral, don’t re­alise how good they have it here. One train breaks down ev­ery 10 months and the world has come to an end as far as Sin­ga­pore is con­cerned.</p>
    <p>“In Lon­don, you would have just de­scribed my morn­ing com­mute.</p>
    <p>“(Sin­ga­pore­ans) could find out what’s go­ing on in the rest of the world, and don’t j ust fo­cus on what’s hap­pen­ing here. Be­cause things that are con­sid­ered a big deal here – in other coun­tries, it’s just life.”</p>
