    <p>JAKARTA • Hun­dreds of Pa­puans held ral­lies across at least eight cities in In­done­sia yes­ter­day to re­new calls for in­de­pen­dence, as a sep­a­ratist group de­clared it had es­tab­lished a pro­vi­sional gov­ern­ment in ex­ile.</p>
    <p>The demon­stra­tions marked the an­niver­sary of West Pa­pua declar­ing in­de­pen­dence from Dutch rule in 1961, which was fol­lowed by a con­tentious United Na­tions-sanc­tioned ref­er­en­dum in 1969 that brought Pa­pua un­der In­done­sian con­trol.</p>
    <p>Mr Roland Levy, one of the more than 100 stu­dents who marched in the cap­i­tal Jakarta, said: “My goal in join­ing the rally to­day is to com­mem­o­rate 59 years of the procla­ma­tion of in­de­pen­dence of the West Pa­puan na­tion that was an­nexed by In­done­sia.”</p>
    <p>De­mon­stra­tors waved ban­ners call­ing for the right to self-de­ter­mi­na­tion. Some Pa­puans re­gard the 1969 plebiscite as un­fair and say in­tim­i­da­tion was used to in­flu­ence the out­come, a charge which Jakarta has re­jected.</p>
    <p>The protests co­in­cided with a dec­la­ra­tion from the United Lib­er­a­tion Move­ment for West Pa­pua that a pro­vi­sional “gov­ern­mentin-wait­ing” had been formed, led by ex­iled in­de­pen­dence fig­ure Benny Wenda.</p>
    <p>Mr Wenda, based in Bri­tain, said the group would push for in­de­pen­dence and no longer “bow down to Jakarta’s il­le­gal mar­tial rule”.</p>
    <p>Mr Teuku Faiza­syah, a spokesman for In­done­sia’s For­eign Min­istry, paid lit­tle heed to what he de­scribed as “Mr Wenda’s self-pro­claimed sta­tus”.</p>
    <p>He said “the sta­tus of Pa­pua as part of In­done­sia, the suc­ces­sor state of the Nether­lands (Dutch) East Indies, is fi­nal”, re­fer­ring to the for­mer colo­nial power. He added that the in­te­gra­tion process was su­per­vised by the UN and in­cluded the adop­tion of a res­o­lu­tion.</p>
    <p>Pa­pua has been plagued by sep­a­ratist con­flict for decades and ac­cess for for­eign jour­nal­ists is of­ten re­stricted. In the past year, there have been deadly at­tacks in­volv­ing se­cu­rity forces and in­dige­nous Pa­puans, in­clud­ing the killing of mi­nors and a pas­tor.</p>
    <p>The UN hu­man rights body on Mon­day ex­pressed con­cern over re­ports of ex­tra­ju­di­cial killings and es­ca­lat­ing vi­o­lence in the re­gion.</p>
