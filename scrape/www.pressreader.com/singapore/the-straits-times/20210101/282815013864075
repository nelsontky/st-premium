    <p>LOS ANGELES • Amer­i­can ac­tress Dawn Wells, who par­layed her girl­next-door charm and whole­some beauty into en­dur­ing tele­vi­sion fame as the sweet-na­tured desert is­land cast­away Mary Ann on the clas­sic 1960s sit­com Gil­li­gan’s Is­land, died on Wed­nes­day at age 82, her pub­li­cist said.</p>
    <p>Wells, who won the ti­tle of Miss Ne­vada in 1959 and com­peted in the Miss Amer­ica con­test, died of com­pli­ca­tions aris­ing from Covid-19, her pub­li­cist Har­lan Boll said in a state­ment.</p>
    <p>Born in the gam­bling city of Reno, Wells played Kansas farm girl Mary Ann Sum­mers, one of seven cast­aways stranded af­ter their boat, the S.S. Min­now, was bat­tered in a storm dur­ing what was sup­posed to be a three-hour tour from Hawaii.</p>
    <p>Wells beat ac­tresses in­clud­ing Raquel Welch for the role.</p>
    <p>Gil­li­gan’s Is­land ran for three sea­sons (1964 to 1967) with a cast that also in­cluded Bob Denver as the zany Gil­li­gan, Alan Hale Jr as “The Skip­per”, Jim Backus as mil­lion­aire Thurston How­ell III, Natalie Schafer as his posh wife, Rus­sell Johnson as “The Pro­fes­sor” and Tina Louise as movie star Gin­ger.</p>
    <p>The death of Wells leaves Louise, 86, the sole sur­vivor of these cast mem­bers.</p>
    <p>The 98 episodes in­vari­ably in­volved their ef­forts in vain to get off the is­land, even as a pa­rade of guest stars dropped in and had no trou­ble get­ting out.</p>
    <p>Wells, play­ing a cheer­ful brunette Mid­west­ern farm girl, ap­peared in the se­ries wear­ing short shorts, midriff tops and pig­tails. Louise, play­ing a buxom red-headed sen­sa­tion akin to Mar­i­lyn Mon­roe, wore slinky, form-fit­ting dresses.</p>
    <p>The two in­spired what be­came an en­dur­ing pop-cul­ture ques­tion for men: “Gin­ger or Mary Ann?”</p>
    <p>Wells said that ques­tion was the most com­mon topic men­tioned to her by fans.</p>
    <p>“Mostly, they’ll pick a favourite, Gin­ger or Mary Ann. For some rea­son, they feel they have to make a choice,” Wells told Forbes magazine in 2016.</p>
    <p>Gil­li­gan’s Is­land was can­celled by net­work ex­ec­u­tives de­spite re­spectable rat­ings, then be­came ubiq­ui­tous in syn­di­cated re-runs.</p>
    <p>Like some of her co-stars, Wells suf­fered from type­cast­ing in Hol­ly­wood af­ter the se­ries ended, ap­pear­ing in tele­vi­sion guest spots and stage work be­fore tak­ing roles in B-movies.</p>
    <p>She also lent her voice to the an­i­mated Gil­li­gan’s Planet (1982) in which the cast­aways be­come stranded on a far­away planet.</p>
    <p>Wells cap­i­talised on her fame by writ­ing the Mary Ann’s Gil­li­gan’s Is­land Cook­book and, later for the 50th an­niver­sary of the se­ries in 2014, the book, What Would Mary Ann Do? A Guide To Life.</p>
    <p>Wells’ mar­riage in 1962 to Larry Rosen, a tal­ent agent, ended in di­vorce in 1967, the same year Gil­li­gan’s Is­land went off the air. She is sur­vived by a step­sis­ter, Weslee Wells.</p>
