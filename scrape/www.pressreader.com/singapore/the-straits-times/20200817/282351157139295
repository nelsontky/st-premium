    <p>LON­DON • The pro­posed takeover of New­cas­tle by a Saudi Ara­bia-backed con­sor­tium col­lapsed after the group de­clined to take up the English Premier League’s of­fer of in­de­pen­dent ar­bi­tra­tion to de­cide who would own the club, the league’s chief ex­ec­u­tive Richard Masters has said.</p>
    <p>The group, which in­cluded Saudi Ara­bia’s Pub­lic In­vest­ment Fund, in­vest­ment firm PCP Cap­i­tal Part­ners and Bri­tish prop­erty bil­lion­aire broth­ers, David and Si­mon Reuben, last month an­nounced they were end­ing their in­ter­est in the £300 mil­lion (S$538.2 mil­lion) deal. It had been de­layed by the Premier League’s own­ers’ and di­rec­tors’ test.</p>
    <p>The group blamed the length of the eval­u­a­tion for the de­ci­sion to with­draw and New­cas­tle Cen­tral MP Chi On­wu­rah had then con­tacted the Premier League for more clar­ity.</p>
    <p>In a let­ter re­spond­ing to On­wu­rah, Masters said: “In June, the Premier League board made a clear de­ter­mi­na­tion as to which en­ti­ties it be­lieved would have con­trol over the club fol­low­ing the pro­posed ac­qui­si­tion.</p>
    <p>“The Premier League asked each such per­son or en­tity to pro­vide ad­di­tional in­for­ma­tion, which would have been used to con­sider the as­sess­ment of any pos­si­ble dis­qual­i­fy­ing events.”</p>
    <p>He re­vealed the con­sor­tium dis­agreed with the rul­ing that “one en­tity would fall within the cri­te­ria re­quir­ing the pro­vi­sion of this in­for­ma­tion” fol­low­ing which the league of­fered it the chance to have the mat­ter deter­mined by an in­de­pen­dent ar­bi­tra­tion tri­bunal.</p>
    <p>The of­fer was sub­se­quently re­jected be­fore the vol­un­tary with­drawal of the of­fer.</p>
    <p>The bid had been crit­i­cised by hu­man rights cam­paign­ers and had raised questions about state-spon­sored pi­rate broad­casts of Premier League games in Saudi Ara­bia.</p>
    <p>Masters in­sisted that there was never a point when the league was asked to make an as­sess­ment on the suit­abil­ity of mem­bers of the con­sor­tium as the group had ended its bid be­fore the is­sue was re­solved. On whether the process needed to be sped up – there was a hold-up of over four months from when the pro­posed takeover was first an­nounced in March un­til its fail­ure – he blamed “in­cor­rect in­for­ma­tion be­ing pub­lished in the me­dia” be­fore claim­ing it was “a del­i­cate bal­ance to strike”.</p>
    <p>Mov­ing for­ward, Masters added the Premier League would re­view its own­ers’ and di­rec­tors’ test to “en­sure it re­mains ro­bust and fair to all in­ter­ested stake­hold­ers”.</p>
