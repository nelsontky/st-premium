    <p>LON­DON • The i dea was to cre­ate a com­mem­o­ra­tive coin to cel­e­brate the work of H.G. Wells, the Bri­tish writer, his­to­rian and so­ci­ol­o­gist best known for the nov­els The In­vis­i­ble Man (1897) and The War Of The Worlds (1898).</p>
    <p>But the £2 (S$3.60) coin The Royal Mint in Bri­tain un­veiled last week has irked some fans of Wells, who spot­ted what they de­scribed as flaws and botched im­agery in the coin’s de­sign, which was in­spired by the au­thor’s books.</p>
    <p>For in­stance, the Mar­tian ma­chine Wells de­scribed in The War Of The Worlds as “a mon­strous tri­pod, higher than many houses”, ap­pears to have four legs in­stead of three. And the im­age of the in­vis­i­ble man on the coin has the char­ac­ter wear­ing a top hat and not the</p>
    <p>“wide-brimmed hat” Wells de­scribed in his book.</p>
    <p>The er­rors, and the re­sponse from Wells afi­ciona­dos, were re­ported by The Guardian.</p>
    <p>“Can I just note that the big walk­ing ma­chine on the coin has four legs? Four legs,” dig­i­tal artist Holly Humphries said on Twit­ter.</p>
    <p>Ms Humphries, of Ox­ford­shire, Eng­land, said she no­ticed the mis­take on Jan 4, the day the coin was an­nounced by The Royal Mint, when she read about it in an on­line fo­rum de­voted to The War Of The Worlds.</p>
    <p>“The tri­pod is an iconic, fa­mous thing in fiction for over 120 years now,” she said, “and to make that mis­take shows an in­cred­i­ble lack of fa­mil­iar­ity with the work, es­pe­cially when you’re try­ing to honour the writer with such a coin.”</p>
    <p>Mr Pa­trick Par­rinder, pres­i­dent of the H.G. Wells So­ci­ety in Lon­don and an au­thor who has writ­ten about Wells, also spot­ted the mis­take.</p>
    <p>“Three legs good, four legs bad,” Mr Par­rinder said of the tri­pod.</p>
    <p>“It’s a shame that the artist didn’t pick that out.”</p>
    <p>Wells So­ci­ety vice-pres­i­dent Adam Roberts, who is a pro­fes­sor at Royal Hol­loway, Univer­sity of Lon­don, said on Twit­ter: “Not only did Wells’ Tripods have *three* legs, Grif­fin, his i nvis­i­ble man, does not wear a top hat.”</p>
    <p>The char­ac­ter’s face, he added, was ban­daged un­der a “wide­brimmed hat”. “So it’s two for two,” he said.</p>
    <p>Wells, who was con­sid­ered an out­stand­ing lit­er­ary fig­ure of his time, is best known for his sci­encefic­tion nov­els, some of which have been adapted into movies. He died in 1946 at the age of 79.</p>
    <p>In an­nounc­ing the coin, The Royal Mint said it was “cel­e­brat­ing the i mag­i­na­tion and in­quir­ing mind of a man who helped shape the world we live in”.</p>
    <p>A spokesman for The Royal Mint said in a state­ment on Jan 6 that it “works with l ead­ing de­sign­ers around the world to cre­ate art on the unique can­vas of a coin”.</p>
    <p>“We en­cour­age t hem to be cre­ative and dis­tinct in their re­sponse to the brief,” she said.</p>
    <p>“When de­vel­op­ing a de­sign for the H.G. Wells coin, we asked artists to con­sider his life and work, en­sur­ing the coin would be in­stantly recog­nis­able and make best use of the space” on a £2 coin.</p>
    <p>The coin was de­signed by Mr Chris Costello, a Bos­ton-based graphic de­signer and il­lus­tra­tor. It de­picts the four-legged alien ma­chine with the in­vis­i­ble man in the fore­ground.</p>
    <p>The coin’s visu­als also in­clude a par­tial Ro­man nu­meral clock, a nod to The Time Ma­chine (1895), Mr Costello said on his web­site.</p>
    <p>“The char­ac­ters in War Of The</p>
    <p>Worlds have been de­picted many times, and I wanted to cre­ate some­thing orig­i­nal and con­tem­po­rary,” Mr Costello said in a state­ment re­leased by The Royal Mint.</p>
    <p>“My de­sign takes in­spi­ra­tion from a va­ri­ety of ma­chines fea­tured in the book, in­clud­ing tripods and the han­dling ma­chines which have five jointed legs and mul­ti­ple ap­pendages.”</p>
    <p>He added that “the fi­nal de­sign com­bines mul­ti­ple sto­ries into one stylised and uni­fied com­po­si­tion that is em­blem­atic” of Wells’ work “and fits the unique can­vas of a coin”.</p>
    <p>On his web­site, he said he used a top hat be­cause it “was eas­ily recog­nised as Vic­to­rian-era in con­trast to the fu­tur­is­tic ma­chine in the back­ground”.</p>
    <p>The coin, which has an im­age of Queen El­iz­a­beth II in pro­file on the other side, will be is­sued later this year, 75 years after Wells’ death, The Royal Mint said. It is part of its an­nual set, a col­lec­tion of coins not­ing an­niver­saries this year, in­clud­ing the Queen’s 95th birth­day.</p>
