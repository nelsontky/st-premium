    <p>The Elec­tions Depart­ment (ELD) will op­er­ate from the site of a for­mer school in Novena Rise from next Mon­day, com­plet­ing its re­lo­ca­tion from its iconic Prin­sep Street premises.</p>
    <p>The move, first an­nounced in Jan­uary last year, will merge the ELD’s cor­po­rate of­fice and train­ing cen­tre. The lat­ter is now in Vic­to­ria Street. Op­er­a­tions at Prin­sep and Vic­to­ria streets will cease with the move.</p>
    <p>The depart­ment, which falls un­der the Prime Min­is­ter’s Of­fice, had pre­vi­ously said the move to Novena Rise re­quired min­i­mal ren­o­va­tion works.</p>
    <p>The site was pre­vi­ously used by Balestier Hill Sec­ondary School but was taken over by the depart­ment after the school moved out fol­low­ing its merger with Beatty Sec­ondary School in Jan­uary 2017.</p>
    <p>Since the mid­dle of 2018, the ELD has put up ten­ders on the gov­ern­ment e-pro­cure­ment por­tal GeBiz for var­i­ous ser­vices and con­struc­tion works at the Novena Rise site.</p>
    <p>These range from project man­age­ment ser­vices to un­der­ground de­tec­tion works, as well as se­cu­rity ser­vices.</p>
    <p>The present ELD of­fice, housed in a three-storey build­ing at the cor­ner of Prin­sep Street and Prin­sep Link, has been the hub of ad­min­is­tra­tive mat­ters re­lated to elec­tions for nearly 25 years, with the most re­cent be­ing the 2020 Gen­eral Elec­tion.</p>
    <p>The ELD was set up in 1947 to train elec­tion of­fi­cers, main­tain and update reg­is­ters of elec­tors as well as plan for the lo­gis­tics of elec­tions.</p>
    <p>The Prin­sep Street site has also been the scene where the Re­turn­ing Of­fi­cer, whose du­ties in­clude over­see­ing the con­duct of polls and di­rect­ing elec­tion of­fi­cials, an­nounces the results.</p>
    <p>The depart­ment is also re­spon­si­ble for pre­par­ing and manag­ing the con­duct of na­tional ref­er­en­dums in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>The ELD was pre­vi­ously lo­cated in Shen­ton Way, at what is now known as the AXA Tower. Be­fore that, it was at the site of the cur­rent Na­tional Gallery of Sin­ga­pore in St An­drew’s Road.</p>
    <p>Plans for the Prin­sep Street premises have not yet been an­nounced.</p>
