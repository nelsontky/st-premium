    <p>Madam Tan Bee Lian, 47, has been out of work since last Novem­ber due to an ill­ness that causes se­vere pain in her bones and joints, and oc­ca­sion­ally leads to numb­ness in her legs.</p>
    <p>But she still has to pay her monthly mort­gage of $490 for her three-room Hous­ing Board flat, and feed her­self and her chil­dren.</p>
    <p>She has three sons, aged 23, 21 and 20, who are look­ing for work, but the el­dest one does not live with her. The di­vorcee also does not re­ceive main­te­nance from her for­mer hus­band.</p>
    <p>She is among about 64,400 in­di­vid­ual ben­e­fi­cia­ries re­ceiv­ing ComCare Short-To-Medium-Term As­sis­tance in FY2019, a 5 per cent in­crease com­pared with the year be­fore.</p>
    <p>The ComCare an­nual report for the fi­nan­cial year be­tween April 1 last year and March 31 this year was re­leased yes­ter­day by the Min­istry of So­cial and Fam­ily De­vel­op­ment (MSF).</p>
    <p>Madam Tan re­ceived $480 a month from Jan­uary to June this year to help with her ex­penses.</p>
    <p>Due to the Covid-19 pan­demic, the as­sis­tance was au­to­mat­i­cally re­newed for July to De­cem­ber, with a higher pay­out of $1,320.</p>
    <p>She also re­ceives gov­ern­ment sub­si­dies for house­hold bills such as util­i­ties.</p>
    <p>“We are re­ally grate­ful. With this, we can buy a lit­tle bit more food. We can pay for house­hold items like soap and sham­poo, and can buy some new clothes too,” said Madam Tan, who used to be a cleaner. She is on med­i­cal leave un­til next month.</p>
    <p>“I am re­ally glad that the Gov­ern­ment recog­nised the plight of lower-in­come fam­i­lies like us, to ex­tend the ComCare au­to­mat­i­cally.</p>
    <p>“It helped a lot of lower-in­come fam­i­lies to tide over this pe­riod. It re­ally saved my fam­ily,” she added in Man­darin.</p>
    <p>House­holds like Madam Tan’s, with no em­ployed in­di­vid­u­als, re­mained the largest pro­por­tion of house­holds on Short-To-Medi­umTerm As­sis­tance.</p>
    <p>The num­ber of house­holds on such as­sis­tance liv­ing in one- to two-room flats has also in­creased, ac­cord­ing to the an­nual report.</p>
    <p>In FY2018, such house­holds made up 51.3 per cent (13,913) of the to­tal of 27,122 house­holds. In FY2019, the pro­por­tion was 52.1 per cent (15,008) of 28,807 house­holds.</p>
    <p>The min­istry said that this in­crease is likely to re­flect the early eco­nomic ef­fects of the pan­demic, as more house­holds ex­pe­ri­enced un­em­ploy­ment and salary loss.</p>
    <p>Ad­di­tion­ally, more house­holds would have be­come el­i­gi­ble for ComCare af­ter ad­just­ments to ComCare as­sess­ment cri­te­ria.</p>
    <p>The as­sess­ment cri­te­ria are based on house­holds’ in­come and their ba­sic liv­ing ex­penses.</p>
    <p>In July last year, MSF raised its benchmarks of house­hold ex­pen­di­ture on ba­sic liv­ing ex­penses, al­low­ing more house­holds to qual­ify for ComCare.</p>
    <p>The min­istry, to­gether with SG Cares com­mu­nity part­ners and vol­un­teers, has also been proac­tively reach­ing out to low-in­come and vul­ner­a­ble groups, in­clud­ing those liv­ing in pub­lic rental flats, said MSF.</p>
    <p>“Vol­un­teers have re­ferred some 2,300 of the 6,300 house­holds en­gaged so far to rel­e­vant agen­cies for fur­ther as­sis­tance,” it said.</p>
