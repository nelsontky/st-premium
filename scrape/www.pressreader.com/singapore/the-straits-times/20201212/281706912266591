    <p>Vis­i­tors from Tai­wan will be able to come into Sin­ga­pore for all forms of travel and not be quar­an­tined from next Fri­day, pro­vided they test neg­a­tive for Covid-19 on ar­rival.</p>
    <p>The same ap­plies to Sin­ga­pore cit­i­zens, per­ma­nent res­i­dents and long-term pass hold­ers re­turn­ing from Tai­wan, the Civil Avi­a­tion Author­ity of Sin­ga­pore (CAAS) said yes­ter­day, as it an­nounced the Repub­lic’s de­ci­sion to uni­lat­er­ally open its bor­ders to Tai­wan.</p>
    <p>It said Tai­wan has a com­pre­hen­sive pub­lic health sur­veil­lance sys­tem and has con­trolled the spread of the Covid-19 virus.</p>
    <p>“Over the past 28 days, Tai­wan</p>
    <p>has zero lo­cal Covid-19 cases. The risk of im­por­ta­tion from Tai­wan is low,” CAAS added.</p>
    <p>Vis­i­tors from Tai­wan can ap­ply for an Air Travel Pass for en­try into Sin­ga­pore from Dec 18. They will have to ad­here to re­quire­ments such as us­ing the TraceTo­gether app, and pay­ing for their med­i­cal bills re­lated to Covid-19, if any.</p>
    <p>The CAAS will also up­date Sin­ga­pore’s travel ad­vi­sory to al­low</p>
    <p>for travel to Tai­wan.</p>
    <p>The open­ing is uni­lat­eral, as re­stric­tions in Tai­wan re­main in place, with leisure and so­cial vis­its by for­eign­ers cur­rently banned.</p>
    <p>Tai­wanese cit­i­zens who want to travel out of the ter­ri­tory can do so. But they will have to test neg­a­tive for Covid-19 within three days prior to their re­turn flight to Tai­wan.</p>
    <p>They will then be tested again</p>
    <p>upon ar­rival in Tai­wan, and will have to be quar­an­tined for 14 days.</p>
    <p>Tai­wan is the sixth place that Sin­ga­pore has uni­lat­er­ally opened up to, af­ter Aus­tralia, Brunei Darus­salam, China, New Zealand and Viet­nam.</p>
    <p>The CAAS said that as at 11.59pm on Thurs­day, it had ap­proved 9,284 ap­pli­ca­tions for vis­i­tors from th­ese places, and re­ceived 4,050 vis­i­tors.</p>
    <p>As at 11.59pm on Wed­nes­day, all vis­i­tors who ar­rived in Sin­ga­pore un­der the Air Travel Pass scheme have tested neg­a­tive for Covid-19.</p>
    <p>Trans­port Min­is­ter Ong Ye Kung said in a Face­book post that he hopes the re­open­ing ar­range­ments will let fam­i­lies and loved ones re­unite amid the up­com­ing fes­tive pe­riod.</p>
    <p>Tai­wan’s For­eign Ministry said Sin­ga­pore’s re­lax­ing of quar­an­tine re­stric­tions for Tai­wanese trav­ellers would grad­u­ally al­low safe travel be­tween both places, and will be help­ful to busi­ness and trade.</p>
    <p>It added that Sin­ga­pore open­ing its doors to Tai­wanese trav­ellers and re­plac­ing quar­an­tine with screen­ings will build up mu­tual trust, which “will be ben­e­fi­cial in dis­cussing the pos­si­bil­i­ties of open­ing a travel bub­ble”.</p>
    <p>Tai­wanese Yi-jen Lee, 31, who works in a non-gov­ern­men­tal or­gan­i­sa­tion in San Fran­cisco but is back in Tai­wan to visit her fam­ily, said: “I am back in Tai­wan be­cause we have done a good job con­tain­ing the virus, and I think peo­ple are more cau­tious be­cause of the gov­ern­ment’s hard work.”</p>
    <p>She ex­pressed cau­tious­ness about trav­el­ling to Sin­ga­pore, given the re­cent com­mu­nity cases, and added: “I don’t think I am go­ing to be vis­it­ing any other coun­try soon, even though I do miss trav­el­ling in South-east Asia.”</p>
