    <p>Six years ago, Ms Pa­tri­cia Yong started cross-train­ing in­ten­sive care unit (ICU) nurses in Singapore Gen­eral Hos­pi­tal (SGH). She would ro­tate them ev­ery three months from the in­ter­me­di­ate care area and high de­pen­dency units to ICUs, and from one ICU to an­other.</p>
    <p>“I wanted the nurses to be ex­posed to a higher level of so­phis­ti­cated care for pa­tients so that when re­quired, we have enough high-skilled nurses to work in such wards,” said the 56-year-old deputy di­rec­tor of nurs­ing at SGH.</p>
    <p>The sound­ness of this ap­proach has now been proven amid the Covid-19 out­break, as com­pe­tent</p>
    <p>ICU nurses could be de­ployed across ICUs as needed.</p>
    <p>Ms Yong started as a reg­is­tered nurse at SGH 35 years ago and later spe­cialised as an ICU nurse.</p>
    <p>She said she was “happy and hum­bled” to re­ceive the Pres­i­dent’s Award for Nurses. “The award is ded­i­cated to the ICU team who work hard ev­ery day. I’m thank­ful that they have also been re­cep­tive of my ideas and sug­ges­tions.”</p>
    <p>As the co-chair of the SGH Cam­pus ICU Com­mit­tee, Ms Yong is in charge of ICU ex­pan­sion, while main­tain­ing the qual­ity and safety of in­ten­sive care. She also over­sees a team of ICU nurses car­ing for Covid-19 pa­tients in the ICU, and is the dis­ease out­break nurs­ing lead for SGH. She was in­volved in op­er­a­tions and plan­ning for Covid-19 re­sponse, in­clud­ing man­power and work­flow plan­ning for the ICU and emergency de­part­ment.</p>
    <p>Draw­ing on her ex­pe­ri­ence with the se­vere acute res­pi­ra­tory syn­drome pa­tients in 2003, she em­pha­sises vig­i­lance in up­hold­ing a high level of in­fec­tion preven­tion prac­tices. “Nurs­ing is not an easy task and per­se­ver­ance is very im­por­tant. Apart from be­ing com­pe­tent in clin­i­cal skills, nurses should also have a high level of emo­tional quo­tient and be com­pas­sion­ate.</p>
    <p>“They must be ob­ser­vant and good lis­ten­ers be­cause if they’re im­pa­tient, they may miss out on symp­toms in a pa­tient.”</p>
    <p>Ms Yong does not want to rest on her lau­rels. She has been ap­pointed as nurs­ing lead of the up­com­ing Elec­tive Care Cen­tre in the SGH Cam­pus, a ded­i­cated fa­cil­ity for sched­uled op­er­a­tions. “It is a big re­spon­si­bil­ity but I look for­ward to tak­ing on the role,” she said.</p>
