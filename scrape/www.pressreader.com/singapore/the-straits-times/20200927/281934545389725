    <p>BANGKOK • An Amer­i­can has been sued by a Thai re­sort over a neg­a­tive Tri­pad­vi­sor re­view, the au­thor­i­ties said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>He could face up to two years in prison if found guilty.</p>
    <p>Do­mes­tic tourism is on­go­ing in Thai­land, where coro­n­avirus num­bers are rel­a­tively low, with lo­cals and ex­pa­tri­ates head­ing to near-empty hol­i­day re­sorts, in­clud­ing Koh Chang is­land, famed for its sandy beaches and turquoise wa­ters.</p>
    <p>But a re­cent visit to the Sea View Re­sort on the is­land landed Mr Wes­ley Barnes in trou­ble af­ter he wrote un­flat­ter­ing on­line re­views about his hol­i­day.</p>
    <p>“The Sea View Re­sort owner filed a com­plaint that the de­fen­dant had posted un­fair re­views on his ho­tel on the Tri­pad­vi­sor web­site,” Colonel Thanapon Taem­sara of Koh Chang po­lice told Agence France-Presse.</p>
    <p>He said Mr Barnes was ac­cused of caus­ing “dam­age to the rep­u­ta­tion of the ho­tel”, and of quar­relling with staff over not pay­ing a cork­age fee for al­co­hol brought to the ho­tel.</p>
    <p>Mr Barnes, who works in Thai­land, was ar­rested by im­mi­gra­tion po­lice and re­turned to Koh Chang where he was briefly de­tained and then freed on bail.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to the Tri­pad­vi­sor re­view Mr Barnes posted in July, he en­coun­tered “un­friendly staff” who “act like they don’t want any­one here”.</p>
    <p>The Sea View Re­sort said le­gal ac­tion was taken only be­cause Mr Barnes had penned mul­ti­ple re­views on dif­fer­ent sites over the past few weeks.</p>
    <p>At least one was posted in June on Tri­pad­vi­sor ac­cus­ing the ho­tel of “mod­ern-day slav­ery”, which the site re­moved af­ter a week for vi­o­lat­ing its guide­lines.</p>
    <p>“We chose to file a com­plaint to serve as a de­ter­rent, as we un­der­stood he may con­tinue to write neg­a­tive re­views week af­ter week,” the ho­tel said.</p>
    <p>It added that the re­sort staff had tried to con­tact Mr Barnes be­fore fil­ing the com­plaint.</p>
    <p>Mr Barnes did not re­spond to re­quests for com­ment.</p>
    <p>Thai­land’s anti-defama­tion laws have long drawn scru­tiny from hu­man rights and press free­dom groups, which say pow­er­ful play­ers use it as a weapon to sti­fle free ex­pres­sion.</p>
    <p>Ear­lier this year, a Thai jour­nal­ist was sen­tenced to two years in prison for post­ing a tweet ref­er­enc­ing a dis­pute over work­ing con­di­tions at a chicken farm.</p>
