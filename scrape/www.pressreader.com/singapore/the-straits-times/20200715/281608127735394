    <p>More than 10,000 com­pa­nies have tapped En­ter­prise Sin­ga­pore (ESG) schemes in their growth and trans­for­ma­tion ef­forts over the first half of this year. This is dou­ble the num­ber of firms that ben­e­fited from these schemes over the same pe­riod last year.</p>
    <p>More than 10,000 com­pa­nies have tapped En­ter­prise Sin­ga­pore (ESG) schemes in their growth and trans­for­ma­tion ef­forts over the first half of this year, dou­ble the num­ber of firms that ben­e­fited from these schemes over the same pe­riod last year.</p>
    <p>The take-up of ESG’s Pro­duc­tiv­ity Solutions Grant and En­ter­prise De­vel­op­ment Grant was re­vealed by Se­nior Min­is­ter of State for Trade and In­dus­try Chee Hong Tat af­ter a tour of Markono Con­tent Solutions’ print­ing fa­cil­ity in Pi­o­neer yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Markono is one of the firms that have ben­e­fited from ESG’s schemes. It has de­vel­oped its au­to­ma­tion pro­cesses over the last few years, in­creas­ing its op­er­a­tional pro­duc­tiv­ity and ef­fi­ciency.</p>
    <p>“(Markono) shows that com­pa­nies in tra­di­tional sec­tors can also trans­form and make good use of tech­nol­ogy to im­prove pro­duc­tiv­ity and to en­hance com­pet­i­tive­ness,” Mr Chee said, not­ing that the com­pany has in­vested in ways to bet­ter har­ness data and sys­tems pro­cess­ing to pro­vide bet­ter ser­vices to its cus­tomers.</p>
    <p>Markono man­ag­ing di­rec­tor Ed­win Ng said that one of the com­pany’s main trans­for­ma­tion plans now is an up­grade of its en­ter­prise re­source man­age­ment sys­tem.</p>
    <p>“This lays the foun­da­tion for us to de­ploy solutions more seam­lessly i n fu­ture, as well as to au­to­mate some of the work pro­cesses that are cur­rently con­ducted man­u­ally by our col­leagues, (such as) ad­min, fi­nance... sales and cus­tomer ser­vice,” he said.</p>
    <p>Mr Chee also an­nounced that a schemes-match­ing tool will be launched next month.</p>
    <p>This e-ad­viser on the GoBusi­ness Li­cens­ing por­tal will rec­om­mend suit­able gov­ern­ment schemes to help or­gan­i­sa­tions grow, based on their needs.</p>
    <p>“The phi­los­o­phy that we use is that the start­ing point (for com­pa­nies) should not be the schemes or the grants. The start­ing point should be what busi­ness trans­for­ma­tion you want to em­bark on,” Mr Chee said.</p>
    <p>“Once we can an­swer these ques­tions, then we can talk about what are some of the schemes that you can ap­ply for that will fa­cil­i­tate this process, or for your com­pany to trans­form, for you to build ca­pa­bil­i­ties.”</p>
    <p>Tar­geted mea­sures to help spe­cific in­dus­tries adapt to the changes brought about by the pan­demic have also seen healthy re­cep­tion from busi­nesses, he said.</p>
    <p>ESG’s food-de­liv­ery and e-com­merce booster pack­ages have been taken up by more than 10,000 food and bev­er­age es­tab­lish­ments and 700 re­tail­ers re­spec­tively.</p>
    <p>Mr Chee said that more than 10,600 en­ter­prises have taken up about $9.4 bil­lion in loans be­tween March and last month.</p>
    <p>This amounts to more than seven times the credit ex­tended un­der ESG loan schemes for the whole of last year, he added.</p>
    <p>Such schemes can help busi­nesses with their cash flow amid eco­nomic chal­lenges and the Covid-19 pan­demic.</p>
    <p>About 80 per cent of firms that have tapped these schemes are small- and mi­cro-en­ter­prises with un­der $10 mil­lion an­nual rev­enue.</p>
    <p>While the firms come from di­verse sec­tors, about a fifth were in whole­sale trade, while 15 per cent were from con­struc­tion and 14 per cent from man­u­fac­tur­ing.</p>
