    <p>When Sin­ga­pore Art Week (SAW) re­turns in Jan­uary next year, art will spring up at bus stops and in an MRT train, a mall and other less con­ven­tional spa­ces.</p>
    <p>The is­land’s an­nual vis­ual arts festival runs from Jan 22 to 30, with more than 100 phys­i­cal and dig­i­tal events fea­tur­ing more than 300 artists and cu­ra­tors from Sin­ga­pore and be­yond.</p>
    <p>The art ex­hi­bi­tion Bus.Stop.Art. in­volves artis­tic in­stal­la­tions and in­ter­ven­tions at bus stops along route 175, which trav­els from Gey­lang to Cle­menti.</p>
    <p>At Fu­nan mall, Cre­ative Unions, a “mall-wide art ac­ti­va­tion” by cu­ra­to­rial firm Neigh­bour­hood, will see artists and the mall’s ten­ants team up for projects such as cap­sule lines of cloth­ing cre­ated by fash­ion la­bels and artists work­ing to­gether.</p>
    <p>SAW, which is en­ter­ing its ninth edi­tion, will have more than 40 com­mis­sioned works – its largest num­ber so far.</p>
    <p>Other festival high­lights range from In­ner Like The OutAR at Gill­man Bar­racks, a large-scale in­stal­la­tion that uses aug­mented re­al­ity; to Moo Moo Park, a drive-through ex­hi­bi­tion at the carpark of the Sin­ga­pore Chi­nese Cul­tural Cen­tre that blends art with in­ter­ac­tive tech­nol­ogy.</p>
    <p>Then, there are the usual artweek events such as the Na­tional Gallery Sin­ga­pore’s Light To Night Festival i n the Civic District; Art­walk at Lit­tle In­dia by Lasalle Col­lege of the Arts; and the Asian Film Archive’s State of Mo­tion se­ries, in which artists will ex­plore the idea of a “South-east Asian Fu­tur­ism” at the Ma­rina One mixed-use de­vel­op­ment.</p>
    <p>S.E.A. Fo­cus by STPI – Cre­ative Work­shop & Gallery, a show­case of con­tem­po­rary art from the re­gion, also re­turns with an on­line ex­hi­bi­tion and a pre­sen­ta­tion of se­lected art­works at Tan­jong Pa­gar Distri­park.</p>
    <p>SAW is an ini­tia­tive by the Na­tional Arts Coun­cil (NAC), Sin­ga­pore Tourism Board and the</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore Economic De­vel­op­ment Board.</p>
    <p>Mr Tay Tong, NAC’s di­rec­tor of sec­tor de­vel­op­ment for vis­ual arts, says in ref­er­ence to the festival’s tagline: “Art Takes Over takes on a whole new mean­ing as SAW 2021 not only crosses the walls of gal­leries into streets and homes, but also tran­scends time and space in the dig­i­tal realm.</p>
    <p>“This is also a re­flec­tion of the larger evolv­ing arts scene, where au­di­ences are in­creas­ingly able to en­joy art any­where and every­where and are no longer con­fined to a phys­i­cal location or the con­ven­tional white cube.”</p>
    <p>On the po­ten­tial im­pact of the pan­demic on festival at­ten­dance, he says: “I wouldn’t worry too much about it. The SAW team did a straw poll which asked, ‘Do you pre­fer to watch on­line or off­line?’ and 85 per cent said they pre­ferred off­line.</p>
    <p>“That’s why a lot of us are do­ing a blended and hybrid ap­proach – so we can reach our au­di­ence in dif­fer­ent ways. I’ve found that by do­ing pro­grammes on the dig­i­tal sphere, we are reach­ing out to au­di­ences who could not be phys­i­cally here.”</p>
    <p>STPI’s ex­ec­u­tive di­rec­tor Emi Eu says S.E.A. Fo­cus will be a “very dif­fer­ent ex­pe­ri­ence” as it has done away with the usual art-fair lay­out of gallery booths.</p>
    <p>“Whether the sales will be down or up, I can­not tell, but we know the im­me­di­acy of im­pulse-buy­ing will not be there.”</p>
    <p>She adds: “Since the on­set of the Covid-19 pan­demic, the en­tire art world has piv­oted onto dig­i­tal plat­forms quite quickly. We are find­ing that there are more and more col­lec­tors will­ing to buy art from a dig­i­tal platform be­cause they know the gal­leries and artists.</p>
    <p>“We hope this hybrid pre­sen­ta­tion (on­line and at Tan­jong Pa­gar Distri­park) will gar­ner the same re­sults, if not bet­ter.”</p>
