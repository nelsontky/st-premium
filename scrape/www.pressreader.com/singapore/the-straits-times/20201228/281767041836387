    <p>NASHVILLE (Ten­nessee) US in­ves­ti­ga­tors are rush­ing to piece to­gether what of­fi­cials de­scribed as an elab­o­rate jig­saw puz­zle, chas­ing more than 500 leads to iden­tify the cul­prit and the mo­ti­va­tion be­hind the Christ­mas Day ex­plo­sion that rocked Nashville, Ten­nessee.</p>
    <p>On Satur­day, lo­cal po­lice and agents from the Fed­eral Bureau of In­ves­ti­ga­tion (FBI) and US Bureau of Al­co­hol, To­bacco, Firearms and Ex­plo­sives searched a two-storey, red-brick house i n Bak­er­town Road in An­ti­och, 18km south-east of Nashville, pay­ing par­tic­u­lar at­ten­tion to its base­ment.</p>
    <p>A mo­tor home, parked on a down­town street of Ten­nessee state’s largest city, ex­ploded at around 6am last Fri­day mo­ments af­ter po­lice – re­spond­ing to re­ports of gun­fire – no­ticed it. They heard an ap­par­ently com­puter-gen­er­ated fe­male voice from in­side recit­ing a minute-by-minute count­down to an im­pend­ing bomb­ing.</p>
    <p>The blast rip­pled across sev­eral blocks, blow­ing win­dows and even caus­ing one build­ing to col­lapse, and it left Nashville rat­tled and per­plexed. About 40 build­ings were dam­aged and at least three peo­ple were in­jured, with the streets largely empty at that hour.</p>
    <p>Parked cars and trees were black­ened and an ex­ploded wa­ter pipe that had been spray­ing overnight cov­ered trees in a layer of ice.</p>
    <p>The au­thor­i­ties said the blast had the po­ten­tial to in­flict enor­mous car­nage had it det­o­nated at a time other than early on a quiet hol­i­day morn­ing and with­out the warn­ing that led po­lice of­fi­cers to clear away as many peo­ple in sur­round­ing build­ings as they could.</p>
    <p>“All the win­dows came in from the liv­ing room into the bed­room. The front door be­came un­hinged,” Mr Buck McCoy, who lives on the block where the blast oc­curred, told lo­cal TV sta­tion WKRN.</p>
    <p>“I had blood com­ing from my face and on my side and on my legs and a lit­tle bit on my feet.”</p>
    <p>Of­fi­cials on Satur­day de­clined to name a per­son of in­ter­est in con­nec­tion with the ex­plo­sion, but CBS News re­ported that the in­ves­ti­ga­tion has homed in on 63-yearold An­thony Quinn Warner, who re­cently lived at the Bak­er­town Road ad­dress, pub­lic records showed.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to a doc­u­ment posted on­line, on Nov 25, he signed over the prop­erty to a woman in Los Angeles at no cost to her.</p>
    <p>The doc­u­ment was signed by Mr Warner, but not by the woman.</p>
    <p>Google Street View im­ages of the house from last year show what ap­pears to be a white mo­tor home in the drive­way. Neigh­bours told WKRN that the recre­ational ve­hi­cle had been parked there for years and is now gone.</p>
    <p>Some US me­dia out­lets re­ported on Satur­day evening that the bomber may have been killed in the blast, but the au­thor­i­ties have not of­fi­cially con­firmed any­thing.</p>
    <p>Pos­si­ble hu­man tis­sue has been found amid the de­bris.</p>
    <p>Po­lice said the blast was “in­ten­tional” but the mo­tive re­mains un­clear and FBI be­havioural an­a­lysts were in­volved in the in­ves­ti­ga­tion.</p>
    <p>“The dam­age is shock­ing and it is a mir­a­cle that no res­i­dents were killed,” Ten­nessee Gover­nor Bill Lee said on Twit­ter.</p>
    <p>He toured the site on Satur­day and said he had asked Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump to de­clare a state of emer­gency, a tech­ni­cal move that trig­gers fed­eral as­sis­tance in re­pair­ing dam­age.</p>
    <p>One of the ma­jor lines of in­quiry was whether there was sig­nif­i­cance in the lo­ca­tion of the blast: on a down­town street in front of an AT&T trans­mis­sion build­ing.</p>
    <p>The ex­plo­sion cre­ated sig­nif­i­cant dam­age to the fa­cil­ity, caus­ing wide­spread reper­cus­sions to telecom­mu­ni­ca­tion sys­tems Nashville and be­yond.</p>
    <p>The Fed­eral Avi­a­tion Ad­min­is­tra­tion tem­po­rar­ily halted flights out of Nashville In­ter­na­tional Air­port be­cause of telecom­mu­ni­ca­tions is­sues caused by the blast. It also la­belled the skies within around a kilo­me­tre or so of the blast “na­tional de­fence airspace”, mean­ing pi­lots are pro­hib­ited from fly­ing over­head with­out au­tho­ri­sa­tion.</p>
    <p>On Satur­day, shop­pers at some re­tail out­lets had to pay with cash or cheques, as sell­ers could not ac­cess credit card sys­tems. in</p>
