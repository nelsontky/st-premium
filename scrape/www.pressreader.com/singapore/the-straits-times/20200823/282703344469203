    <p>While freshly minted MP Don Wee has learnt much from vis­it­ing res­i­dents, he has also been learn­ing from pay­ing his last re­spects to them.</p>
    <p>At­tend­ing res­i­dents’ wakes is some­thing he has had to do dur­ing his first weeks as a Chua Chu Kang GRC MP, and one wake early this month stood out for him.</p>
    <p>A sin­gle mother who passed away had left be­hind a 19-year-old daugh­ter study­ing in a polytech­nic and an el­derly mother with de­men­tia. Wor­ried about what might hap­pen to them, Mr Wee went to work.</p>
    <p>He con­tacted the daugh­ter’s school to ar­range for fi­nan­cial as­sis­tance, sourced a nurs­ing home for the el­derly woman with the Agency for In­te­grated Care and asked the Hous­ing Board to sort out es­tate mat­ters so the teenage or­phan would be able to keep her home.</p>
    <p>“They seemed help­less. But that’s when I re­alised that I can lever­age all my con­tacts to help them,” says Mr Wee, 43, a se­nior vice-pres­i­dent at United Over­seas Bank (UOB) and a mem­ber of the In­sti­tute of Men­tal Health’s Board of Vis­i­tors.</p>
    <p>Mr Wee and the 30 other first­time elected MPs have spent the past six weeks l earn­ing sim­i­lar les­sons while car­ry­ing out their du­ties and serv­ing res­i­dents since win­ning in their con­stituen­cies in the July 10 Gen­eral Elec­tion.</p>
    <p>Some, like Ang Mo Kio GRC MP Ng Ling Ling, 48, say that un­der­stand­ing how to be an MP is a steep learn­ing curve. One as­pect of this for Ms Ng, a former civil ser­vant, has been work­ing with vol­un­teers to ease res­i­dents’ anx­i­eties about the eco­nomic im­pact of the Covid-19 pan­demic and make ap­peals to the right chan­nels for as­sis­tance.</p>
    <p>“This made me ap­pre­ci­ate even more the com­mu­nity-leader role of an MP – some­one whom res­i­dents in need can turn to, who will lis­ten to their predica­ments, care about them and of­fer ad­vice, coun­sel and sup­port, es­pe­cially when they are faced with un­cer­tain­ties,” she says.</p>
    <p>Hol­land-Bukit Timah GRC MP Ed­ward Chia says he went through a “bap­tism of fire” when he had to sort out bus i ssues ear­lier this month. The au­thor­i­ties had an­nounced on Aug 3 that four bus ser­vices in Bukit Pan­jang ply­ing a route par­al­lel to the MRT Down­town Line would ei­ther stop oper­at­ing or be rerouted – a de­ci­sion that up­set res­i­dents.</p>
    <p>The Land Trans­port Author­ity re­versed some of the changes 10 days later, after three pub­lic pe­ti­tions and the in­ter­ven­tion of Mr Chia and Bukit Pan­jang MP Liang Eng Hwa, who both met Se­nior Min­is­ter of State for Trans­port Chee Hong Tat to dis­cuss the is­sue.</p>
    <p>Mr Chia, 36, who re­ceived hun­dreds of e-mails and mes­sages on this mat­ter, noted: “We do need to hear sug­ges­tions from our res­i­dents be­cause they do have good sug­ges­tions and so­lu­tions.”</p>
    <p>IM­PACT OF COVID-19</p>
    <p>Mr Chia is not the only one who has had an in­box full of res­i­dents’ com­ments. All the PAP MPs In­sight spoke to say they have re­ceived many mes­sages, es­pe­cially as phys­i­cal Meet-the-Peo­ple Ses­sions (MPS) were not al­lowed till Aug 10, ow­ing to the Covid-19 out­break.</p>
    <p>Many of the MPs opened up com­mu­ni­ca­tion chan­nels like What­sApp and e-mail so that res­i­dents could reach them. They con­ducted vir­tual MPSes through video­con­fer­enc­ing plat­forms like Zoom, and used so­cial me­dia tools like Face­book or In­sta­gram for live out­reach ses­sions.</p>
    <p>Things do not al­ways go per­fectly, but the PAP MPs lean on one another for sup­port and ad­vice through a chat group where they share tips on how to bet­ter use such tools to do their jobs, shares East Coast GRC MP Tan Kiat How, 43.</p>
    <p>Mr Tan, a Min­is­ter of State in the Prime Min­is­ter’s Of­fice and the Min­istry of Na­tional De­vel­op­ment, adds that this “ex­chang­ing of notes” has helped his batch of first­time MPs build a strong sense of ca­ma­raderie.</p>
    <p>But through the ex­pe­ri­ence of us­ing vir­tual tools, some MPs, like Chua Chu Kang GRC’s Mr Zhulka­r­nain Ab­dul Rahim, 39, have also come to realise how im­por­tant house vis­its are, as the “close­ness” that comes with a face-to-face con­ver­sa­tion is, to him, ir­re­place­able.</p>
    <p>Mr Yip Hon Weng, 43, the MP for Yio Chu Kang, says he wel­comed news of be­ing able to meet res­i­dents in phys­i­cal MPSes and prefers to chat with them in per­son.</p>
    <p>MPs can­not de­gen­er­ate into an “e-mail ser­vice” where all they do is sim­ply for­ward the mes­sages they re­ceive to the rel­e­vant agen­cies to sort out, he says.</p>
    <p>“Some­times, you don’t get the per­spec­tive over e-mail. When you see the body lan­guage, then you know, then you un­der­stand what the real is­sue is,” he says.</p>
    <p>How­ever, this does not mean that they are all sim­ply rush­ing to meet res­i­dents.</p>
    <p>Jurong GRC’s Mr Xie Yao Quan, who is 35 and the youngest PAP MP In­sight spoke to, says that while he is do­ing his best to meet as many res­i­dents as pos­si­ble, he wants to make sure he spends qual­ity time with them.</p>
    <p>His Jurong Cen­tral ward has about 100 blocks of HDB flats, and his plan is to be able to cover all of them within two years. Says Mr Xie: “That works out to about one block a week. I want to spend suf­fi­cient time with each fam­ily.”</p>
    <p>MAK­ING AD­JUST­MENTS</p>
    <p>Time man­age­ment is some­thing the MPs have put more ef­fort into since the elec­tion, and some of them tell In­sight that sac­ri­fices have had to be made. Mr Xie, for in­stance, says he has less time for sleep now, but is man­ag­ing this well, thanks to some help from cof­fee.</p>
    <p>The MPs also have less time with their fam­i­lies as they jug­gle their day jobs, time for res­i­dents and com­mu­nity events.</p>
    <p>Mr Wee says an ad­just­ment he has had to make is end­ing work ear­lier – in­stead of his usual 8pm or 9pm, he now logs off from work at about 6.45pm and con­sid­ers him­self lucky to have bosses at UOB who are un­der­stand­ing.</p>
    <p>He also makes it a point to keep Fri­day evenings and Sunday nights for his fam­ily, in­clud­ing his two sons, aged 12 and 14. “I told my con­stituency di­rec­tor my cal­en­dar is open for him to fill other than Fri­day evenings and Sunday nights, which I will re­serve for my par­ents and my fam­ily,” he says.</p>
    <p>Many MPs say that while hav­ing time with loved ones is not im­pos­si­ble, they have to make an ef­fort to re­main present in their fam­i­lies’ lives.</p>
    <p>No mat­ter how busy he is, Mr Yip makes sure he goes home in time to see his fam­ily mem­bers, in­clud­ing his five young chil­dren, be­fore they go to sleep every day.</p>
    <p>And Marine Pa­rade GRC MP Tan See Leng, who is 55 and the old­est first-time MP In­sight spoke to, says that at least once a week, he and his fam­ily try to get to­gether for ac­tiv­i­ties like go­ing out for walks.</p>
    <p>Dr Tan, who is a Min­is­ter in the Prime Min­is­ter’s Of­fice, Sec­ond Min­is­ter for Man­power and Sec­ond Min­is­ter for Trade and In­dus­try, also spends about 20 min­utes each day chat­ting with his wife about what has hap­pened in the day.</p>
    <p>AD­VICE FROM MEN­TORS</p>
    <p>It is not just their fam­ily mem­bers and res­i­dents whom these first­time MPs are mak­ing time for. Some have been meet­ing their more ex­pe­ri­enced se­niors to seek ad­vice.</p>
    <p>Last Thurs­day, Mr Chia met Nee Soon GRC MP Louis Ng to chat about his plans for his Zhenghua ward. He has also been reg­u­larly meet­ing his Hol­land-Bukit Timah GRC team­mates, whom he says have been help­ful in giv­ing him dif­fer­ent per­spec­tives and help­ing him see what his blind spots might be.</p>
    <p>Mr Yip shares Mr Chia’s sen­ti­ments, and says that since the elec­tion, he has met five of his se­niors, in­clud­ing former trans­port min­is­ter Khaw Boon Wan and re­tired MP Lee Bee Wah, who is help­ing him with his con­stituency’s plans to re­de­velop a com­mu­nity cen­tre.</p>
    <p>“Many of them have been do­ing this for a while, so I touch base with them for some tips or guid­ance about what to do,” he adds.</p>
    <p>When asked by In­sight whether he has any ad­vice for the first-time MPs, Mr Charles Chong, who was the long­est-serv­ing PAP back­bencher in Par­lia­ment till he re­tired in June, says it is up to MPs to adapt and find the best way to ad­dress their con­stituen­cies in these ex­tra­or­di­nary Covid-19 times.</p>
    <p>MAIDEN SPEECH</p>
    <p>Mr Chong, who was elected to rep­re­sent Sembawang GRC in 1988, adds that MPs should use their maiden speeches in Par­lia­ment to cre­ate a first im­pres­sion, as these can be defin­ing mo­ments.</p>
    <p>The MPs are ex­pected to be­gin mak­ing their first speeches in Par­lia­ment from Aug 31, when they de­bate the Pres­i­dent’s Ad­dress.</p>
    <p>In his first speech, Mr Chong, then a labour MP, called on the Gov­ern­ment to adopt a five-day work week for the civil ser­vice – which then worked a 5½-day week. This earned him a lunch with then Prime Min­is­ter Lee Kuan Yew, who “ro­bustly put to (him) that it was not wise to erode the strong work ethic of Sin­ga­pore­ans”.</p>
    <p>“I left the lunch with a dis­tinct im­pres­sion that my po­lit­i­cal ca­reer would be a very short-lived one. How­ever, that did not hap­pen, and change did come about many years later,” adds Mr Chong. The five-day work week for the pub­lic ser­vice was in­tro­duced in 2004.</p>
    <p>MPs should thus use their de­but speeches in Par­lia­ment to speak their minds and not worry too much about who may dis­agree with them, ad­vises the vet­eran MP. Says Mr Chong: “There will al­ways be de­trac­tors and those who mean well but com­pletely dis­agree with you.”</p>
    <p>When asked for some in­di­ca­tion on what they will be speak­ing about, some of the MPs say that they are still plan­ning what to say, but some have al­ready de­cided.</p>
    <p>Ms Ng will be speak­ing on is­sues that her res­i­dents have come to her about: em­ploy­ment for more atrisk groups, men­tal health amid the pan­demic and the need for so­cial co­he­sion at this time.</p>
    <p>Mr Wee will be touch­ing on small and medium-sized en­ter­prises and how as­sis­tance to them can be stream­lined and ex­pe­dited, while Mr Zhulka­r­nain in­tends to fo­cus on is­sues af­fect­ing fam­ily units.</p>
    <p>And Dr Wan Rizal Wan Zakariah, 42, a Jalan Be­sar GRC MP, will be talking about how ed­u­ca­tion can be used as a ve­hi­cle for so­cial mo­bil­ity, as this is an is­sue he plans to con­tinue speak­ing up about.</p>
    <p>The se­nior lec­turer at Repub­lic Polytech­nic, who was a Nor­mal (Aca­demic) stu­dent, has a PhD in sports science from the Na­tional In­sti­tute of Ed­u­ca­tion.</p>
    <p>“For so­cial mo­bil­ity to hap­pen, the Gov­ern­ment must con­tinue to en­sure that mul­ti­ple path­ways must be made avail­able re­gard­less of their start­ing point in life,” he says.</p>
    <p>The open­ing of Par­lia­ment to­mor­row will not be the first time these new MPs have en­tered Par­lia­ment House as a co­hort. They un­der­went an ori­en­ta­tion pro­gramme on Aug 7, when they were in­tro­duced to the Par­lia­ment staff who will be sup­port­ing them, as well as the var­i­ous pro­ce­dures and rules they have to ad­here to.</p>
    <p>There was also a lunch hosted by Speaker of Par­lia­ment Tan ChuanJin and a tour of the build­ing.</p>
    <p>For Mr Zhulka­r­nain, the tour left a last­ing im­pres­sion and re­in­forced the im­mense task that lies be­fore him and his col­leagues.</p>
    <p>“It just shows that we are steeped in tra­di­tion and we have all of these val­ues to up­hold and a rep­u­ta­tion to main­tain, and we draw strength from them,” he says.</p>
