    <p>For celebri­ties who be­came first­time par­ents ear­lier this year, this Christ­mas had added sig­nif­i­cance.</p>
    <p>Home-grown model-ac­tress Sheila Sim, who gave birth to her daugh­ter Layla Woo in Septem­ber, posted on so­cial me­dia a photo of her­self with Layla and her banker hus­band Deon Woo last Fri­day.</p>
    <p>Sim, 36, wrote: “It’s Layla’s first Christ­mas. Christ­mas has got a new mean­ing to it with our lit­tle one in our life.”</p>
    <p>She also posted a photo with Layla and her two nieces last Satur­day.</p>
    <p>“When­ever they come visit Layla, Layla would quickly wake up from her nap and greet them with such big smiles,” wrote the ac­tress of drama series 118 (2014 to 2018). “And then she would watch them ten­ta­tively, like she can’t wait to join them.”</p>
    <p>Sev­eral Hong Kong celebri­ties – ac­tor Raymond Lam, singer Lui Fong and ac­tor Joel Chan – be­came fa­thers a few months ago. Lam, 41, and Lui, 56, ap­peared in pho­tos posted by their wives on­line.</p>
    <p>Lam’s wife – Chi­nese model Ca­rina Zhang, 30 – gave birth to their daugh­ter in Septem­ber, but her face has never been shown. In the fam­ily pho­tos posted by Zhang on Weibo, their daugh­ter’s face was cov­ered by a car­toon sticker.</p>
    <p>Lui sur­prised fans in May when the Hong Kong me­dia re­ported he had mar­ried en­trepreneur Rain­bow Ng, his girl­friend of seven years.</p>
    <p>Ms Ng, who gave birth to their daugh­ter in Au­gust, posted pho­tos of the fam­ily, in which the lit­tle girl was seen in a San­ta­rina cos­tume.</p>
    <p>For Chan, 44, whose wife Ap­ple Ho gave birth to their son Jaco in July, he posted pho­tos on so­cial me­dia with hash­tags such as #HopeThePan­demicWil­lEndSoon and #FirstChris­t­masForOurF­am­i­lyOfThree.</p>
    <p>For other celebri­ties who have be­come par­ents to a se­cond child,</p>
    <p>Christ­mas was no less spe­cial.</p>
    <p>Lo­cal singers Tay Kewei, 37, and Al­fred Sim, 39, who wel­comed their se­cond son in June, posted pho­tos of their fam­ily. Tay wrote: “First Christ­mas for our lit­tle #xi­aopi­anpian”.</p>
    <p>The cou­ple also have a three­year-old son, Momo.</p>
    <p>Hong Kong ac­tress Grace Chan, 29, who is mar­ried to ac­tor Kevin Cheng, 51, gave birth to their se­cond son, Yan­nick, in July.</p>
    <p>She posted on so­cial me­dia a photo of their fam­ily of four and wrote: “This year has been a wild one (to say the least). There have been a lot of ups and downs but, re­gard­less of ev­ery­thing, to­day is about the good, the great, the bless­ings.”</p>
    <p>The cou­ple have an­other son, Rafael, who will turn two in Fe­bru­ary next year.</p>
