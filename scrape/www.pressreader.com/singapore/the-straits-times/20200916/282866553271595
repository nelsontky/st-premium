    <p>Aries</p>
    <p>(March 21 - April 19)</p>
    <p>Start ex­er­cis­ing again or re­dou­ble your ef­forts. Your en­ergy lev­els will be­gin to climb again once you break through the wall.</p>
    <p>Taurus</p>
    <p>(April 20 - May 20)</p>
    <p>You feel at­tached to some­thing or some­one that is good for you, so strengthen that con­nec­tion. It is easy for you to show you care.</p>
    <p>Gemini</p>
    <p>(May 21 - June 20)</p>
    <p>It is a good time to hatch schemes, but you should make sure you are pre­pared to fol­low through on them later.</p>
    <p>Can­cer</p>
    <p>(June 21 - July 22) Make plans if you can. You have all the de­tails cov­ered, even if you do not fully un­der­stand what is go­ing on.</p>
    <p>Leo</p>
    <p>(July 23 - Aug 22)</p>
    <p>You have the right mind­set to make ad­just­ments to your fi­nances. En­joy what you have and find ways to get more.</p>
    <p>Virgo</p>
    <p>(Aug 23 - Sept 22)</p>
    <p>Ev­ery­thing seems to click into place and you un­der­stand more about a per­son, place or thing. Use this new knowl­edge to make life sweet.</p>
    <p>Libra</p>
    <p>(Sept 23 - Oct 22)</p>
    <p>You can­not get rid of that nag­ging voice telling you to speed up or do some­thing crazy. Do partly what it says to qui­eten it down.</p>
    <p>Scorpio</p>
    <p>(Oct 23 - Nov 21)</p>
    <p>You find your­self in a sit­u­a­tion in which you can­not trust any­one else to get things right, so hun­ker down and take care of the de­tails your­self.</p>
    <p>Sagittariu­s</p>
    <p>(Nov 22 - Dec 21)</p>
    <p>It is tough to han­dle a boss who seems to have it in for you, but do not panic. Just en­sure that you are tak­ing care of im­por­tant busi­ness.</p>
    <p>Capricorn</p>
    <p>(Dec 22 - Jan 19)</p>
    <p>You find it much eas­ier to get things done and may not no­tice how quickly the time goes by as you whip through your work. En­joy it.</p>
    <p>Aquarius</p>
    <p>(Jan 20 - Feb 18)</p>
    <p>You may feel more con­nected to those around you, but your ideas are not quite as world-chang­ing. Hang in there – the phase will pass.</p>
    <p>Pisces</p>
    <p>(Feb 19 - March 20) Things are up in the air, but in a good way, so you should be able to make progress even if it feels that you are run­ning blind.</p>
