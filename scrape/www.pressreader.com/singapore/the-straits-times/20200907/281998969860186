    <p>The do­mes­tic helper who killed an el­derly cou­ple be­fore flee­ing to In­done­sia got the idea from a movie, The Re­venger Queen, to tie them up so that she could es­cape.</p>
    <p>This was ac­cord­ing to court doc­u­ments that The Straits Times ob­tained from the In­done­sian Supreme Court.</p>
    <p>Khasanah, also known as Ana Ab­dul Muis in the court pa­pers, mur­dered Mr Chia Ngim Fong, 79, and his wife, Madam Chin Sek Fah, 78, on June 21, 2017.</p>
    <p>She is serv­ing a 20-year j ail sen­tence i n her home coun­try af­ter a trial there for the dou­ble mur­der.</p>
    <p>De­tails of the killing were re­vealed last week in Sin­ga­pore in a coro­ner’s in­quiry, but In­done­sian court doc­u­ments also i ncluded pho­tos that showed the level of bru­tal­ity in­volved.</p>
    <p>Af­ter ty­ing up Mr Chia, Khasanah hit him re­peat­edly with a wooden stool as he screamed for help.</p>
    <p>She also stomped on Madam Chin’s chest, even though the el­derly woman was al­ready re­strained and on the floor.</p>
    <p>Pho­tos of the crime scene showed the cou­ple crouched in a foetal po­si­tion on the floor in a bed­room and a bath­room, with their limbs tied up with green raf­fia string.</p>
    <p>Khasanah, now 44, man­aged to flee to In­done­sia, but was caught a week later.</p>
    <p>NOT THE FIRST EM­PLOYER</p>
    <p>Khasanah was born in Ke­bu­men Re­gency in Cen­tral Java on Aug 10, 1976, the sixth of eight chil­dren.</p>
    <p>She was mar­ried in 1996 and has four chil­dren with her hus­band. Her two sons and two daugh­ters are now aged be­tween 10 and 22.</p>
    <p>The maid started work­ing in Malaysia in 2008 and was di­vorced in 2011, the same year she stopped work­ing there.</p>
    <p>The Chias were not Khasanah’s first em­ployer in Sin­ga­pore. She came to Sin­ga­pore on March 3, 2017, and started work­ing at a household four days later.</p>
    <p>In­done­sian court doc­u­ments showed she was un­happy work­ing for a Wong fam­ily, claim­ing she was sub­jected to ver­bal abuse on a daily ba­sis.</p>
    <p>On May 6 that year, she told her em­ployer that she wanted to leave.</p>
    <p>She even threat­ened to jump from their apart­ment on the sixth floor if they dis­agreed.</p>
    <p>Her em­ployer gave in and sent her back to the maid agency.</p>
    <p>As a trans­fer maid, Khasanah was re-em­ployed quickly from Royale Em­ploy­ment Ser­vices at Bukit Timah Shop­ping Cen­tre.</p>
    <p>The Chias picked her later that month to be a helper at their maisonette in Block 717 Be­dok Reser­voir Road.</p>
    <p>Khasanah told in­ves­ti­ga­tors that she re­ferred to them as “un­cle” and “aun­tie”, but just a month into the job, cracks started ap­pear­ing.</p>
    <p>She was not happy work­ing for them.</p>
    <p>She claimed that Madam Chin had scolded her at around 10am on June 21, just be­fore the mur­ders.</p>
    <p>Khasanah told in­ves­ti­ga­tors in In­done­sia that she then hatched a plan to es­cape. This was af­ter she spot­ted her pass­port in a bed­room that the cou­ple’s son oc­cu­pied.</p>
    <p>She de­cided she would tie up the cou­ple, copy­ing a scene from the movie. It is not known if The Re­venger Queen is an In­done­sian film.</p>
    <p>Khasanah also de­cided to cover their mouths with duct tape to stop them from scream­ing.</p>
    <p>She first tar­geted Mr Chia, who was sleep­ing on a bed. She held his hands and pasted duct tape over his mouth, and was ty­ing his hands with raf­fia when he woke up and be­gan to strug­gle.</p>
    <p>The duct tape cov­er­ing his mouth came l oose and he started to scream. Khasanah turned on the tele­vi­sion to drown out his cries for help and punched him in the face with her fists.</p>
    <p>But when she saw Mr Chia bleed­ing, she pan­icked. She then picked up a wooden stool and re­peat­edly hit his head with it.</p>
    <p>Re­al­is­ing what had hap­pened, Madam Chin con­fronted Khasanah and a scuf­fle broke out be­tween the pair. The el­derly woman lost her bal­ance and fell onto the floor.</p>
    <p>Khasanah then tied Madam Chin’s hands and legs with raf­fia and an­chored the strings to a towel rail­ing in the bath­room.</p>
    <p>When she saw Madam Chin still strug­gling, she stepped on her body sev­eral times while hold­ing on to the bath­room sink, un­til the el­derly woman lay mo­tion­less on the floor.</p>
    <p>Khasanah then left the flat af­ter tak­ing her pass­port and some of the</p>
    <p>MAID’S PLEA cou­ple’s valu­ables, which in­cluded sev­eral pieces of gold jew­ellery, mo­bile phones and five watches worth at least $500 in to­tal.</p>
    <p>Mr Chia and Madam Chin, who were found tied up and un­con­scious, were pro­nounced dead at around 4pm on the same day.</p>
    <p>Mr Chia had suf­fered blunt force trauma to his head, while Madam Chin suf­fered blunt force trauma to her head and chest.</p>
    <p>HER ES­CAPE AND AR­REST</p>
    <p>Khasanah made it to Har­bourFront Cen­tre and left for Batam via ferry later that day.</p>
    <p>She told In­done­sian in­ves­ti­ga­tors that she spent one night in Ho­tel Lai Lai Batam be­fore trav­el­ling to Jambi in Su­ma­tra on June 22, where she checked into Ho­tel Masa Kini.</p>
    <p>She was at an In­ter­net cafe known as Fikry Net at around 3am two days later when a gamer there, known only as Mr Hari­adi, over­head her talk­ing to some­body on her mo­bile phone.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to the gamer, Khasanah had said: “It was an ac­ci­dent that per­son ‘passed’ by my hands. Never mind, I will join a pe­santren (Is­lamic board­ing school).”</p>
    <p>Khasanah later re­turned to the ho­tel and checked out at noon on June 24.</p>
    <p>The man­ager, known only as Mr Ham­dani, told in­ves­ti­ga­tors that she did so af­ter be­ing told that the ho­tel would close and not re­ceive any guests on June 25 due to Hari Raya Puasa.</p>
    <p>She then moved into Nam­ber Ho­tel, also in Jambi.</p>
    <p>On June 27, Mr Hari­adi told In­done­sian po­lice about what he had heard and told of­fi­cers that Khasanah was stay­ing at Nam­ber Ho­tel.</p>
    <p>Po­lice ar­rested her the next day in her ho­tel room.</p>
    <p>Fol­low­ing her ar­rest, Khasanah told in­ves­ti­ga­tors: “I didn’t in­tend to kill. I only wanted to re­turn to In­done­sia.”</p>
    <p>She was orig­i­nally sen­tenced to life i mpris­on­ment i n In­done­sia af­ter a trial in 2018, but had the sen­tence re­duced on ap­peal.</p>
    <p>She was not handed over to the au­thor­i­ties i n Sin­ga­pore even though her of­fences were com­mit­ted here. This was due to the prin­ci­ple of per­son­aliteit, which re­quires any In­done­sian ar­rested i n the coun­try for a crime com­mit­ted over­seas to be pro­cessed in In­done­sia in­stead of be­ing sent to the ju­ris­dic­tion where the of­fence took place.</p>
    <p>I didn’t in­tend to kill. I only wanted to re­turn to In­done­sia.</p>
    <p>KHASANAH, telling in­ves­ti­ga­tors af­ter her ar­rest in Jambi, In­done­sia, in 2017.</p>
