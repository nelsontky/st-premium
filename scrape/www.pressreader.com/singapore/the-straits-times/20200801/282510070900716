    <p>Though Mr Marvin Liang, 34, and Ms Chong Lingyi, 32, bought their four-room Hous­ing Board flat in De­pot Road just two years ago, their vision for their home started long be­fore.</p>
    <p>Years of book­marked ref­er­ences and de­sign in­spi­ra­tion gave the mar­ried cou­ple a solid idea of their first home to­gether. The or­gan­ised and creative pair, who work in advertisin­g, even col­lated their de­sign brief and wish­lists into a multi-page mood board as they scouted for a suit­able in­te­rior de­signer.</p>
    <p>They found a kin­dred spirit in Mr Mikael Teh of home-grown de­sign com­pany Mono­cot Stu­dio and en­trusted the ren­o­va­tion to him.</p>
    <p>The cou­ple wanted a mid-century modern vibe in­voked by a dusky pal­ette of dark wood and navy blue, filled in with tropical plants, rat­tan fur­ni­ture and wall­hung art for a com­fort­able lived-in feel­ing.</p>
    <p>Ms Chong says: “We knew we wanted things like rat­tan and cer­tain colours, but we couldn’t visu­alise them co­he­sively.”</p>
    <p>Mr Teh was able to bring the dis­parate de­tails to­gether in his 3D renderings, which the cou­ple say helped bring their vision to life.</p>
    <p>The four-month ren­o­va­tion cost about $65,000 and they moved into the flat in Au­gust 2018.</p>
    <p>Off-white walls, arched door­ways and con­crete screed floors form a muted yet el­e­gant back­drop in the liv­ing room, which al­low the eclec­tic style of the 1,000 sq ft home to re­ally pop.</p>
    <p>Vin­tage Scan­di­na­vian fur­ni­ture like their side­board ex­ists along­side a royal-blue vel­vet sofa and an out­sized rat­tan lounge chair close to the win­dows.</p>
    <p>Judg­ing by the lush gar­den of in­door plants in their liv­ing room’s “mini bal­cony”, one would not ex­pect that the flat ac­tu­ally re­ceives lit­tle nat­u­ral light.</p>
    <p>Fac­ing Telok Blan­gah Hill means the cou­ple en­joy ver­dant views, but with the sun ob­scured, their in­te­ri­ors are fairly dim.</p>
    <p>Still, they pressed on with the dark colour scheme and kept ar­ti­fi­cial il­lu­mi­na­tion to a min­i­mum.</p>
    <p>For in­stance, the walls of their hall­way were painted a shade of for­est green and warmly lit with a trio of del­i­cate pen­dant lamps.</p>
    <p>Nick­named their “flo­ral cor­ri­dor”, it is dec­o­rated with frames of vin­tage pressed flower art and paint­ings of or­chids by Ms Chong’s grandaunt, artist Lim Chu Suan.</p>
    <p>They re­served one bed­room as a guest room and con­verted an­other into a study.</p>
    <p>Their favourite tomes – they are book­worms – sit on shelves built along the length of the navy-blue wall in their study, while mis­matched chairs flank a hand­some wooden desk they got sec­ond-hand.</p>
    <p>The book­shelves, along with the rat­tan wardrobes in the bedrooms and dusty blue kitchen cab­i­nets are just a hand­ful of built-in fur­ni­ture in the house, as the cou­ple mostly wanted loose pieces that they could take to their next home.</p>
    <p>They also found that in­stead of hid­ing their pos­ses­sions be­hind stor­age units, dis­play­ing items con­trib­uted bet­ter to the lived-in look they de­sired.</p>
    <p>“Our logic with stor­age was, the more stor­age space you have, the more you will buy and stash them and the ac­cu­mu­la­tion of stuff goes un­no­ticed,” says Mr Liang.</p>
    <p>“So by keep­ing ev­ery­thing on dis­play, it has in­flu­enced us to think through our pur­chases very care­fully and get only the things we ab­so­lutely need.”</p>
