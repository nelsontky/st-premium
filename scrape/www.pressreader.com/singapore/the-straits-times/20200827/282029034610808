    <p>A kid­ney dis­ease pa­tient at Tan Tock Seng Hospi­tal (TTSH) died in 2016 from acute haem­or­rhage af­ter an artery and vein were ac­ci­den­tally punc­tured dur­ing the catheter in­ser­tion pro­ce­dure for his peri­toneal dial­y­sis.</p>
    <p>This is be­lieved to be the first case of death of its kind here, ac­cord­ing to an in­de­pen­dent doc­tor who was nom­i­nated by the Acad­emy of Medicine Sin­ga­pore (AMS) to look into the mat­ter.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to the Na­tional Kid­ney Foun­da­tion’s web­site, peri­toneal dial­y­sis is a treat­ment for kid­ney fail­ure in which a ster­ile fluid is in­tro­duced into the body through a per­ma­nent tube placed in the peri­toneal cav­ity – a space within the ab­domen that con­tains the in­testines, stom­ach and liver.</p>
    <p>The fluid then cir­cu­lates through the ab­domen to draw im­pu­ri­ties from the sur­round­ing blood ves­sels in the ab­dom­i­nal cav­ity and is drained from the body.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, fol­low­ing an in­quiry, Coro­ner Marvin Bay found Mr Lee Kuen Ngian’s death to be a “truly un­for­tu­nate med­i­cal mis­ad­ven­ture”.</p>
    <p>He said that Dr See Yong Pey, a con­sul­tant at TTSH’s re­nal medicine de­part­ment, re­viewed Mr Lee on Nov 2, 2016.</p>
    <p>The 74-year-old Sin­ga­porean was then ad­mit­ted for day surgery eight days later and Dr See started the catheter in­ser­tion pro­ce­dure.</p>
    <p>An in­ci­sion was made in Mr Lee’s ab­domen and nor­mal saline was flushed into a can­nula, which is a thin tube in­serted into a vein or</p>
    <p>This is be­lieved to be the first case of death of its kind here, ac­cord­ing to an in­de­pen­dent doc­tor who was nom­i­nated by the Acad­emy of Medicine Sin­ga­pore to look into the mat­ter.</p>
    <p>body cav­ity to ad­min­is­ter med­i­ca­tion, drain off fluid or in­sert a sur­gi­cal in­stru­ment.</p>
    <p>Mr Lee was then placed in a Tren­de­len­burg po­si­tion where his head was placed fac­ing up­wards at a lower level than his feet to fa­cil­i­tate ac­cess to the ab­dom­i­nal or­gans. The peri­toneal space was then in­suf­flated or filled with air.</p>
    <p>Coro­ner Bay said: “Shortly af­ter 800ml of air was in­tro­duced into his peri­toneal cav­ity, Mr Lee... col­lapsed at 1.10pm. The pro­ce­dure was aban­doned and the can­nula was re­moved im­me­di­ately.”</p>
    <p>Mr Lee died later that day.</p>
    <p>The AMS later nom­i­nated two ex­perts to look into the case: Dr Cheng Shin Chuen, a sur­geon in pri­vate prac­tice from Mount El­iz­a­beth Novena Spe­cial­ist Cen­tre, and Dr Tan Chieh Suai from the Sin­ga­pore Gen­eral Hospi­tal’s de­part­ment of re­nal medicine.</p>
    <p>Dr Cheng ex­pressed his view that “Dr See most likely punc­tured the (ves­sels) un­know­ingly with a faulty tech­nique. He ba­si­cally passed the sharp point of the tro­car (a sharp­pointed sur­gi­cal in­stru­ment used with a can­nula to punc­ture a body cav­ity) all the way in, in­jur­ing the artery and vein at the same time”.</p>
    <p>Coro­ner Bay said that to the best of Dr Tan’s knowl­edge, this was the first case of death of its kind in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>Dr See, how­ever, ques­tioned the in­de­pen­dent AMS med­i­cal ex­perts’ opin­ion that the pat­tern of Mr Lee’s in­jury was a di­rect con­se­quence of the tro­car be­ing pushed too deep into the ab­dom­i­nal cav­ity.</p>
    <p>Coro­ner Bay said: “Dr See main­tained his al­ter­na­tive the­ory that the in­jury to the ves­sels had been in­ad­ver­tently in­flicted by the metal can­nula, which had been within the peri­toneal cav­ity af­ter the tro­car was re­moved for the ster­ile air in­suf­fla­tion process.</p>
    <p>“While one of his hands was used to sta­bilise the can­nula, he posited that mi­nor move­ment of (Mr Lee’s) part... may have oc­curred when Mr Lee was placed in the Tren­de­len­burg po­si­tion de­spite his be­ing strapped down to the op­er­at­ing ta­ble.”</p>
    <p>Dr See be­lieved that this move­ment by Mr Lee led to the in­juries seen in his ves­sels, said the coro­ner.</p>
