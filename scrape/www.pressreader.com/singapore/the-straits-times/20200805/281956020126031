    <p>It is wel­come news that Sin­ga­pore and Malaysia have of­fi­cially re­sumed the project for the cross­bor­der Rapid Tran­sit Sys­tem (RTS) Link be­tween Wood­lands and Jo­hor Baru. This was done with a cer­e­mony one day ahead of a fi­nal dead­line fol­low­ing mul­ti­ple post­pone­ments. Not un­ex­pect­edly, the start of the ser­vice has been pushed back from the pre­vi­ous timetable of end-2024 to the new tar­get of end-2026. How­ever, the 4km line will still con­nect pas­sen­gers be­tween Jo­hor’s Bukit Cha­gar ter­mi­nus sta­tion and the Sin­ga­pore ter­mi­nus in Wood­lands North. The Cus­toms, im­mi­gra­tion and quar­an­tine fa­cil­i­ties will be co-lo­cated so that pas­sen­gers have to clear im­mi­gra­tion only once, at the point of de­par­ture.</p>
    <p>An­other change is that the RTS Link now will be a stand­alone light rail tran­sit (LRT) sys­tem and not use the same trains and sys­tems as Sin­ga­pore’s Thom­son-East Coast MRT Line (TEL). Con­se­quently, the RTS Link will also no longer use the ex­ist­ing TEL’s de­pot at Mandai. A new de­pot will be built in Jo­hor Baru. How­ever, the cross-bor­der link’s ca­pac­ity re­mains un­changed at up to 10,000 pas­sen­gers per hour in each di­rec­tion. Along with the con­ve­nience of hav­ing Cus­toms and re­lated fa­cil­i­ties be­ing co-lo­cated, the pur­pose of the link is tied es­sen­tially to the speed and reli­a­bil­ity with which it can serve as a con­nec­tion for com­muters. So long as the LRT sys­tem meets those ob­jec­tives, it would be a wor­thy en­ter­prise.</p>
    <p>The Cause­way, com­pleted in 1923, has been a re­mark­ably busy bor­der cross­ing. It was used by 300,000 peo­ple to cross daily be­fore the coro­n­avirus pan­demic struck. In spite of the open­ing of the Sec­ond Link be­tween the two na­tions, traf­fic jams on the Cause­way, par­tic­u­larly dur­ing week­ends and on fes­tive oc­ca­sions, were an un­happy fea­ture of an oth­er­wise happy co­ex­is­tence. The Cause­way’s de­serted look now ex­em­pli­fies the state of two linked economies which are both un­der epi­demi­o­log­i­cal siege. Once the cri­sis sub­sides and then passes, as it must, cross-bor­der travel will re­sume in sub­stan­tial num­bers. It sim­ply is not ef­fi­cient for Malaysians and Sin­ga­pore­ans to have to de­pend sig­nif­i­cantly on a con­nec­tive struc­ture that is al­most a cen­tury old.</p>
    <p>In­stead, the his­tor­i­cal sym­bol­ism of the Cause­way is now be­ing re­vi­talised by newer and faster modes of travel that are less vul­ner­a­ble to de­lay and dis­rup­tion. Bet­ter con­nec­tiv­ity from Wood­lands to Jo­hor Baru ex­em­pli­fies a mu­tu­ally ben­e­fi­cial eco­nomic and so­cial re­la­tion­ship be­tween Sin­ga­pore and Malaysia. Those ties in turn sup­port the in­fra­struc­ture of con­nec­tiv­ity that is a nec­es­sary part of Asean’s eco­nomic and po­lit­i­cal cen­tral­ity and in­deed its cred­i­bil­ity in Asian re­la­tions. Progress in the con­struc­tion of the pro­posed Kuala Lumpur-Sin­ga­pore High-Speed Rail project would add fur­ther mo­men­tum to the gains to be made from the RTS Link.</p>
