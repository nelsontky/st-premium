    <p>The de­mand for flu vac­cines has spiked in the past few months, as peo­ple l ook to safe­guard their health with the loom­ing win­ter flu sea­son, and as travel grad­u­ally re­sumes.</p>
    <p>Doc­tors and in­fec­tious dis­eases ex­perts here have been en­cour­ag­ing peo­ple to get the flu vac­cine even though the num­ber of in­fluenza cases re­mains low, so as to guard against a pos­si­ble “twindemic” of Covid-19 and the flu.</p>
    <p>Even as coun­tries bat­tle the coro­n­avirus pan­demic, an­other vi­ral wave caused by in­fluenza not only threat­ens to over­whelm stretched health­care sys­tems, but it is also much more likely to kill those un­lucky enough to catch both viruses.</p>
    <p>Lo­cally, the num­ber of in­fluenza cases has re­mained low, with poly­clin­ics see­ing fewer than half the num­ber of pa­tients seek­ing treat­ment for acute res­pi­ra­tory in­fec­tion (ARI) com­pared with the same pe­riod last year.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to the lat­est statis­tics from the Min­istry of Health’s Weekly In­fec­tious Dis­ease Bul­letin, there was a daily av­er­age of 1,038 pa­tients seek­ing treat­ment for ARI from Sept 27 to Oct 3, ver­sus 2,619 cases in the same pe­riod last year.</p>
    <p>But among those who had sought treat­ment for ARI, the num­ber of pa­tients with in­fluenza-like ill­ness was be­low 5 per cent, and the num­ber of those who tested pos­i­tive for in­fluenza has re­mained at zero since June.</p>
    <p>This is likely a re­sult of manda­tory mask wear­ing, safe dis­tanc­ing and en­hanced per­sonal hy­giene cou­pled with less trav­el­ling this year, said doc­tors here.</p>
    <p>Dr John Cheng, head of pri­mary care and fam­ily physi­cian at Health­way Med­i­cal Group, said: “In Sin­ga­pore, the flu sea­son tends to ar­rive dur­ing the cooler pe­ri­ods be­tween De­cem­ber and Fe­bru­ary, and be­tween May and July, which co­in­cide with the North­ern Hemi­sphere and South­ern Hemi­sphere win­ter epi­demics, as well as the con­ven­tional peak travel sea­sons.”</p>
    <p>With no­tably fewer trav­ellers mov­ing in and out of the coun­try, along with the safe­guards taken by the pub­lic, the flu’s chain of trans­mis­sion is thus re­duced dur­ing this pe­riod, he added.</p>
    <p>De­spite this, Dr Cheng has seen a 40 per cent in­crease in peo­ple get­ting flu vac­cines in the past two months, com­pared with the same pe­riod last year, as many are “be­com­ing more con­scious about their over­all health and well-be­ing”.</p>
    <p>Med­i­cal di­rec­tor of Park­way Shen­ton Ed­win Chng said this was also the case for the chain’s clin­ics, with there be­ing a 40 per cent in­crease in the de­mand for vac­cines be­tween July and this month, com­pared with last year.</p>
    <p>“Many peo­ple are hop­ing to stay well and healthy by tak­ing the flu vac­cine, as it gives them some sense of se­cu­rity, es­pe­cially since there is no vac­cine cur­rently avail­able for Covid-19,” he said, not­ing that fur­ther eco­nomic re­open­ings and the an­tic­i­pa­tion of gen­eral travel re­sum­ing could ac­count for the in­creased de­mand.</p>
    <p>Like­wise, Dr Asok Ku­rup, an in­fec­tious dis­eases spe­cial­ist at Mount El­iz­a­beth Hos­pi­tal, said he has seen a 10 per cent to 20 per cent in­crease in in­ter­est for flu vac­cines, which could be largely at­trib­uted to in­creased education and aware­ness of pub­lic health, a spillover ef­fect from the Covid-19 cri­sis.</p>
    <p>“With all this talk about a Covid-19 vac­cine, peo­ple are more well in­formed of the need to take pre­cau­tion­ary mea­sures to safe­guard their health from in­fec­tious dis­eases which are pre­ventable,” he said.</p>
    <p>Dr Chng an­tic­i­pates that the de­mand for vac­cines will con­tinue to in­crease in the com­ing months, es­pe­cially with en­hanced sub­si­dies for the i nfluenza vac­cine from next month.</p>
    <p>For vac­cines ad­min­is­tered at Com­mu­nity Health As­sist Scheme (Chas) gen­eral prac­ti­tioner clin­ics, el­i­gi­ble Sin­ga­porean adults, such as Pi­o­neer and Merdeka Gen­er­a­tion card hold­ers, as well as Chas card hold­ers, can have their pay­ments capped at be­tween $9 and $35 for each dose.</p>
    <p>Oth­er­wise, the vac­ci­na­tion is also of­fered at hos­pi­tals, poly­clin­ics and GP clin­ics, and cost be­tween $35 and $50.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to the im­mu­ni­sa­tion sched­ules, one dose of in­fluenza vac­ci­na­tion is rec­om­mended an­nu­ally or ev­ery flu sea­son, par­tic­u­larly for vul­ner­a­ble groups, such as in­di­vid­u­als with chronic ill­nesses, young chil­dren, se­niors and preg­nant women.</p>
    <p>There­fore, Dr Chng noted, doc­tors have been more proac­tive in rec­om­mend­ing flu vac­ci­na­tions, par­tic­u­larly for pa­tients in high­risk groups.</p>
    <p>“By re­duc­ing the spread of (in­fluenza) virus, which has symp­toms sim­i­lar to Covid-19, it helps to re­duce the noise in­ter­fer­ing with di­ag­nos­ing the Covid-19 virus,” he said.</p>
    <p>Dr Cheng said that “in the ab­sence of a Covid-19 vac­cine, we should con­tinue to safe­guard our health by pro­tect­ing our­selves against vac­cinepre­ventable ill­nesses”.</p>
    <p>“With the flu vac­cine, in­di­vid­u­als are also pro­tected against the pos­si­bil­ity of be­ing in­fected with both in­fluenza and Covid-19 at the same time. If this were to oc­cur, the fa­tal­ity rate would greatly in­crease.”</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to an ar­ti­cle pub­lished by The Guardian on Sept 22, a study con­ducted in Bri­tain among a group of 58 peo­ple found that 43 per cent of those co-in­fected with the flu and Covid-19 had died, ver­sus only 26.9 per cent who had tested pos­i­tive solely for Covid-19.</p>
    <p>Fear­ing the pos­si­bil­ity of the flu and other res­pi­ra­tory ill­nesses cir­cu­lat­ing over the win­ter pe­riod, the Bri­tish gov­ern­ment bought 30 mil­lion doses of flu vac­cine, with pri­or­ity for im­mu­ni­sa­tion given to the el­derly and those with pre-ex­ist­ing med­i­cal con­di­tions.</p>
    <p>In­fec­tions in Bri­tain have reached record lev­els with more than 17,000 new cases re­ported on Thurs­day, and Europe re­ported 96,996 new cases – the high­est to­tal for the re­gion ever recorded by the World Health Or­gan­i­sa­tion (WHO).</p>
    <p>Pro­fes­sor Dale Fisher, a senior con­sul­tant in the di­vi­sion of in­fec­tious dis­eases at the Na­tional</p>
    <p>Univer­sity Hos­pi­tal, said that in win­ter, tem­per­ate coun­tries tend to ex­pe­ri­ence a higher in­ci­dence of in­fluenza.</p>
    <p>“So, the ma­jor con­cern is that these Euro­pean coun­tries, as well as the United States, will ex­pe­ri­ence this in ad­di­tion to the Covid-19 prob­lems, which in it­self is stress­ing the health­care sys­tem,” said Prof Fisher, who is also the chair­man of WHO’s Global Out­break Alert and Re­sponse Net­work.</p>
    <p>“How­ever, since the mit­i­ga­tion mea­sures for Covid-19 trans­mis­sion also pre­vent the flu, coun­tries with poor im­ple­men­ta­tion of Covid-19-rel­e­vant in­ter­ven­tions are there­fore likely to suf­fer this twindemic, mak­ing health sys­tems very at risk,” he added.</p>
