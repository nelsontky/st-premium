    <p>Are vac­ci­na­tions free?</p>
    <p>Can you choose which one to take?</p>
    <p>How do they work? How safe are they ?</p>
    <p>Is safe dis­tanc­ing nec­es­sary af­ter vac­ci­na­tion?</p>
    <p>As Sin­ga­pore ramps up its in­oc­u­la­tion pro­gramme, IN­SIGHT an­swers key ques­tions about Covid-19 vac­cines</p>
    <p>Q Can I choose which Covid-19 A vac­cine to take?</p>
    <p>No. The Health Sci­ences Au­thor­ity (HSA) has to date ap­proved only one vac­cine by Pfizer-BioNTech.</p>
    <p>Q Is it free?</p>
    <p>A Covid-19 vac­cines will be free for all Sin­ga­pore­ans and long-term res­i­dents who are cur­rently here.</p>
    <p>This in­cludes those here on an em­ploy­ment or S-pass, as well as work per­mit hold­ers, for­eign do­mes­tic work­ers, and de­pen­dant’s pass, long-term visit pass and stu­dent pass hold­ers.</p>
    <p>Q What if I refuse to take the vac­cine? Will I lose my job, es­pe­cially if I am a health­care worker?</p>
    <p>A Al­though vac­ci­na­tions are not com­pul­sory for health­care work­ers, all lo­cal res­i­dents, in­clud­ing health­care work­ers, are urged to go for the jabs.</p>
    <p>There is no plan to al­ter the du­ties of health­care work­ers who do not get vac­ci­nated, said Na­tional Cen­tre for In­fec­tious Dis­eases (NCID) ex­ec­u­tive di­rec­tor Leo Yee Sin. Hos­pi­tals will also con­tinue to en­act pre­ven­tive mea­sures.</p>
    <p>Q What vac­cines are cur­rently avail­able?</p>
    <p>A Sin­ga­pore has to date ap­proved only one Covid-19 vac­cine for use here, by Amer­i­can phar­ma­ceu­ti­cal com­pany Pfizer and its Ger­man part­ner BioNTech.</p>
    <p>How­ever, the coun­try has also signed pur­chase agree­ments with Amer­i­can biotech­nol­ogy firm Moderna, as well as China’s Si­no­vac.</p>
    <p>The Sin­ga­pore au­thor­i­ties have said that if all goes ac­cord­ing to sched­ule, Sin­ga­pore will have enough doses for its peo­ple by the third quar­ter of the year.</p>
    <p>Q How many vac­cine doses do we have? When did the vac­cines ar­rive?</p>
    <p>A The num­ber of vac­cines Sin­ga­pore has is a sen­si­tive num­ber and can­not be dis­closed.</p>
    <p>Health Min­is­ter Gan Kim Yong said Sin­ga­pore is working on se­cur­ing a port­fo­lio of Covid-19 vac­cines to cater to dif­fer­ent seg­ments of the pop­u­la­tion. Di­ver­si­fy­ing the port­fo­lio will im­prove its chances of se­cur­ing a suit­able vac­cine for ev­ery­one.</p>
    <p>The first batch of the Pfiz­erBioNTech Covid-19 vac­cine landed on Dec 21.</p>
    <p>Q Can I get the Covid-19 vac­cine with­out an ap­point­ment? What if I for­get to take the sec­ond dose?</p>
    <p>A Prior book­ings will be nec­es­sary, given the cold-chain re­quire­ments at the vac­ci­na­tion sites and mul­ti­dose vials of the vac­cines. It will also en­sure op­er­a­tional ef­fi­ciency and min­imise in­di­vid­ual wait times.</p>
    <p>More in­for­ma­tion on how to make a book­ing will be pro­vided later.</p>
    <p>Q Af­ter I am vac­ci­nated, does it mean I do not need to wear masks? Can safe dis­tanc­ing mea­sures be re­laxed?</p>
    <p>A As­so­ciate Pro­fes­sor Lim Poh Lian, a mem­ber of the ex­pert com­mit­tee on Covid-19 vac­ci­na­tion, cau­tioned that a vac­cine is not 100 per cent ef­fec­tive. This would mean that there could still be a few peo­ple get­ting Covid-19 in­fec­tion even af­ter get­ting vac­ci­nated.</p>
    <p>Vac­ci­na­tions will also take time to roll out and some peo­ple, such as those who are im­muno­com­pro­mised, will be un­able to re­ceive the vac­cine. Oth­ers may refuse to get vac­ci­nated.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore is also still see­ing im­ported cases, and not ev­ery­one in the world will have the op­por­tu­nity to get vac­ci­nated, Prof Lim added.</p>
    <p>Be­cause of all this, mask wear­ing and safe dis­tanc­ing mea­sures will re­main para­mount.</p>
    <p>Q Can I choose which Covid-19 vac­cine to take?</p>
    <p>A No. The Health Sci­ences Au­thor­ity has to date ap­proved only one vac­cine by Pfizer-BioNTech. Those who opt to re­ceive the vac­cine will re­ceive a phys­i­cal vac­ci­na­tion card and will be able to check their vac­ci­na­tion records on­line.</p>
    <p>Q When will it be my turn to get vac­ci­nated? What are some of the con­sid­er­a­tions?</p>
    <p>A Forty health­care work­ers at the NCID were the first batch to be vac­ci­nated on Dec 30 last year and vac­ci­na­tions in hos­pi­tals started yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The pri­or­ity groups for vac­ci­na­tion are based on a risk as­sess­ment. Health­care, front-line and other es­sen­tial per­son­nel are vac­ci­nated first, to pre­serve health­care and other es­sen­tial sys­tems.</p>
    <p>Oth­ers at greater risk of se­vere dis­ease will be vac­ci­nated from next month.</p>
    <p>This will be­gin with se­niors aged 70 and above, as pro­tect­ing the el­derly, who are more likely to suf­fer se­vere ill­ness, will help to take pres­sure off the health­care sys­tem.</p>
    <p>Those who are in jobs or work in set­tings where there is a risk of a su­per-spread­ing event, such as those in the con­struc­tion and marine sec­tors and mi­grant work­ers, are also a pri­or­ity. Pro­tect­ing these high­risk in­di­vid­u­als will re­duce the like­li­hood of virus spread into the com­mu­nity. There­after, Sin­ga­pore will pro­gres­sively broaden vac­ci­na­tions to other Sin­ga­pore­ans and long-term res­i­dents who are med­i­cally el­i­gi­ble.</p>
    <p>As more vac­cines are ap­proved for use, the na­tion will ad­just its vac­ci­na­tion pro­gramme ac­cord­ing to the sup­ply of doses, as well as dis­ease pat­terns at that point in time.</p>
    <p>Q Will the vac­ci­na­tion leave a keloid scar like the Bacil­lus Cal­mette-Guerin (BCG) vac­cine?</p>
    <p>A It is un­likely as this is an in­tra­mus­cu­lar in­jec­tion (like the in­fluenza vac­cine). There have been no re­ports of scar­ring.</p>
    <p>Un­like the BCG, where the in­jec­tion site is just be­neath the sur­face of the skin, most in­tra­mus­cu­lar in­jec­tions will not leave a scar be­cause the in­flam­ma­tion oc­curs in the mus­cle.</p>
