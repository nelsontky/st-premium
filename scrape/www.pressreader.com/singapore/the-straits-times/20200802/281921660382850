    <p>KHABAROVSK • Thou­sands of peo­ple braved the rain in the far eastern city of Khabarovsk yes­ter­day to at­tend another huge protest march against the ar­rest of the re­gion’s pop­u­lar gover­nor.</p>
    <p>For the fourth week­end, demon­stra­tors marched through the streets chant­ing anti-Krem­lin slo­gans and in support of for­mer gover­nor Sergei Fur­gal, who was ar­rested and taken to Moscow last month to face charges of mas­ter­mind­ing mur­ders 15 years ago.</p>
    <p>The ar­rest of the 50-year-old – who was elected in 2018, beat­ing a ri­val from the rul­ing United Rus­sia party – has sparked un­prece­dented protests in the far eastern re­gion.</p>
    <p>Lo­cals see the move as po­lit­i­cally mo­ti­vated and ques­tion why he is be­ing tried in the far­away cap­i­tal.</p>
    <p>“To grab the gover­nor like that, like the worst ban­dit... that’s spit­ting into the faces of the cit­i­zens who elected him,” Mr Stanislav Na­sonov, 40, told Agence FrancePres­se at the rally.</p>
    <p>Fur­gal, held in Moscow’s no­to­ri­ous Le­for­tovo prison, has been fired, and Rus­sian Pres­i­dent Vladimir Putin has re­placed him with a new young gover­nor with no ties to the re­gion, a move that has not gone down well in Khabarovsk.</p>
    <p>Sup­port­ers of Fur­gal, a mem­ber of the na­tion­al­ist Lib­eral Demo­cratic Party of Rus­sia, feel he is be­ing be­lat­edly pun­ished for de­feat­ing the United Rus­sia can­di­date in the 2018 elec­tion.</p>
    <p>The Krem­lin says Fur­gal has se­ri­ous charges to an­swer.</p>
    <p>The rally yes­ter­day was vis­i­bly smaller than that in the pre­vi­ous week­end, which was the largest over 22 days of near-daily protests.</p>
    <p>Jour­nal­ists es­ti­mated the turnout at around 30,000 peo­ple, while the Khabarovsk city hall put the num­ber at just 3,500, claim­ing there was “fall­ing in­ter­est”.</p>
    <p>De­spite a down­pour, spir­its were high among the marchers, who clapped, waved signs and Rus­sian flags and chanted “20 years – no trust” in ref­er­ence to the amount of time Mr Putin has been in power.</p>
    <p>“Our free­dom of choice is be­ing taken away,” said pen­sioner Py­otr Smirnov, 65.</p>
    <p>“We are protest­ing to open that window again, and not just for us but for the whole of Rus­sia.”</p>
    <p>A protest in­volv­ing sev­eral hun­dred peo­ple in support of Khabarovsk was also held in Vladi­vos­tok, where po­lice de­tained sev­eral peo­ple, according to OVD-Info.</p>
