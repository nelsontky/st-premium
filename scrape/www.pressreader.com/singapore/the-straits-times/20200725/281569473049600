    <p>Pri­vate home prices de­fied the pan­demic to edge up in the sec­ond quar­ter, but the lack of launches amid the cir­cuit breaker kept sales num­bers down. The lat­est of­fi­cial data showed that prices rose by 0.3 per cent in the sec­ond quar­ter from the pre­vi­ous three months, re­vers­ing the Ur­ban Re­de­vel­op­ment Au­thor­ity’s flash es­ti­mates of a 1.1 per cent de­cline.</p>
    <p>Pri­vate home prices de­fied the pan­demic to edge up in the sec­ond quar­ter, but the lack of launches dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker pe­riod kept sales num­bers down.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day’s data also prompted an­a­lysts to warn that a mar­ket re­cov­ery is far from cer­tain as busi­ness clo­sures, salary cuts and job losses take their toll in the months ahead.</p>
    <p>The data showed that prices rose 0.3 per cent in the sec­ond quar­ter from the pre­vi­ous three months, re­vers­ing the Ur­ban Re­de­vel­op­ment Au­thor­ity’s (URA) flash es­ti­mates of a 1.1 per cent de­cline.</p>
    <p>The rise is in stark con­trast to the 1 per cent de­cline in the first quar­ter, and puts prices up 1.2 per cent from the sec­ond quar­ter of last year.</p>
    <p>“This sur­pris­ing turn­around was due to pent-up de­mand in the lat­ter half of June as show-flats were opened (from June 19) as well as view­ings... al­lowed,” noted Knight Frank Sin­ga­pore head of re­search Leonard Tay. “In the first half of 2020, the over­all prices of pri­vate res­i­den­tial homes fell by 0.7 per cent, a very mild de­cline con­sid­er­ing the pan­demic and eco­nomic dis­rup­tion.”</p>
    <p>But Ms Tricia Song, head of re­search for Sin­ga­pore at Col­liers In­ter­na­tional, warned that prices and take-up could drift lower in the sec­ond half of the year de­pend­ing on the ex­tent of the eco­nomic fall­out.</p>
    <p>The price re­cov­ery in the sec­ond quar­ter was un­even, she noted, with the in­crease led by non-landed homes in prime ar­eas, which jumped 2.7 per cent com­pared with a 2.2 per cent drop in the first quar­ter.</p>
    <p>Non-landed prop­erty prices in the city fringe fell 1.7 per cent com­pared with a 0.5 per cent de­cline in the pre­vi­ous quar­ter.</p>
    <p>Prices in the sub­urbs edged up 0.1 per cent com­pared with a 0.4 per cent fall in the pre­vi­ous quar­ter.</p>
    <p>Landed home prices were flat in the sec­ond quar­ter, af­ter dip­ping 0.9 per cent in the first, the URA said.</p>
    <p>Ms Song noted that prices of most new projects in prime dis­tricts were at best un­changed, and there were deep dis­counts at com­pleted es­tates such as 8 Saint Thomas.</p>
    <p>This recorded 14 caveats in the sec­ond quar­ter at a me­dian price of $2,730 per sq ft (psf), while ear­lier units sold at $3,100 to $3,200 psf.</p>
    <p>That said, some larger re­cently com­pleted projects in the fi­nan­cial dis­trict saw re­newed in­ter­est. Ma­rina One Res­i­dences sold 78 units in the first quar­ter at a me­dian price of $2,295, and 35 units at $2,312 psf in the sec­ond, Ms Song noted.</p>
    <p>De­vel­op­ers launched 1,852 un­com­pleted pri­vate homes ex­clud­ing ex­ec­u­tive con­do­mini­ums (ECs) in the sec­ond quar­ter, com­pared with 2,093 units in the first.</p>
    <p>They sold 1,713 units (ex­clud­ing ECs) in the sec­ond quar­ter, 20.3 per cent fewer than the 2,149 units sold in the first. New homes sales slowed in April and May but re­bounded last month due to the end of the cir­cuit breaker and re­open­ing of show-flats.</p>
    <p>There were 3,862 new pri­vate homes sold in the first half, just 7.8 per cent lower than in the same pe­riod last year, noted Mr Ong Teck Hui, se­nior di­rec­tor of re­search and con­sul­tancy at JLL.</p>
    <p>But the re­sale mar­ket was hit much harder by the cir­cuit breaker, as only 951 units were sold in the sec­ond quar­ter – the low­est since the first quar­ter of 1998 when 644 units were trans­acted, he added.</p>
    <p>The grow­ing num­ber of trans­ac­tions as well as rel­a­tive price sta­bil­ity in the sec­ond quar­ter may prompt de­vel­op­ers to launch more projects in the com­ing months.</p>
    <p>ERA Realty head of re­search and con­sul­tancy Nicholas Mak said 17 new projects with a to­tal of 5,243 units would be ready for launch in the next six to nine months.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, rents are ex­pected to con­tinue to trend lower in the com­ing quar­ters as leas­ing de­mand weak­ens due to the eco­nomic slow­down and on­go­ing bor­der con­trols, Mr Ong said. Pri­vate home rents fell 1.2 per cent in the sec­ond quar­ter versus a 1.1 per cent rise in the first. Rental vol­ume dipped be­low 20,000 for the first time since the fourth quar­ter of 2017, he noted.</p>
    <p>There were 49,090 un­com­pleted pri­vate homes (ex­clud­ing ECs) in the pipe­line with plan­ning ap­proval as of the end of the sec­ond quar­ter, up from 48,868 units in the first quar­ter. There were 27,977 units un­sold com­pared with 29,149 in the first quar­ter.</p>
    <p>But Ms Song noted that due to the con­struc­tion halt in the sec­ond quar­ter, only 86 pri­vate homes (ex­clud­ing ECs) ob­tained tem­po­rary oc­cu­pa­tion per­mit, well down from the 1,528 units com­pleted in the first quar­ter and 2,298 in the last three months of last year. “The num­ber of com­ple­tions in 2020 will be sig­nif­i­cantly be­low the 10-year his­tor­i­cal av­er­age of 12,948 units.”</p>
