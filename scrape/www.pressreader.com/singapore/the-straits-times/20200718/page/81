A summer intern at Accredify, an identity management start-up, Mr Teo is helping to develop cross-platform mobile applicatio­ns that are beneficial to Singaporea­ns.
He will start full-time work as a software engineer in a multinatio­nal payments technology company later this year after he graduates with a Bachelor of Science (Informatio­n Systems) from the Singapore Management University. He shares how the SG:D Scholarshi­p offered by Infocomm Media Developmen­t Authority (IMDA) helped him to fulfil his dreams. “I want to contribute my skills towards building a society that is continuous­ly innovating in the field of technology. I hope to build software products that are accessible to everyone, and make our lives here safer and much more fun.” “My overseas learning experience­s at University of California, Berkeley and The University of British Columbia were also memorable.” What impact do you hope to have on Singapore in the future?                                Why did you sign up for the SG:D Scholarshi­p? “I wanted to challenge myself beyond academics and gain some exposure to technology sector networks. Software engineerin­g allowed me to express my creativity for problem solving and critical thinking. I have developed a strong interest ever since. This scholarshi­p has given me the freedom to forge my own career path based on my interests and passion.” How has the SG:D Scholarshi­p enriched your undergradu­ate life? “It provided extensive networking programmes for scholars to reach out to companies about work and learning opportunit­ies like technical workshops. The technical and soft skills we gained brought our dreams of working in the technology sector a little closer.
