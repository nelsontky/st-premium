    <p>WASHINGTON United States agen­cies ac­cused Rus­sia of break­ing into gov­ern­ment com­puter net­works, the se­cond such claim in as many days, while more de­tails emerged of spoofed e-mails al­legedly sent to vot­ers by Iran.</p>
    <p>Law en­force­ment and se­cu­rity agen­cies have been on high alert to avoid a re­peat of 2016, when hack­ers al­leged to be work­ing for Rus­sia’s mil­i­tary in­tel­li­gence stole and re­leased e-mails be­long­ing to prom­i­nent US Democrats in a bid to help Mr Don­ald Trump get elected pres­i­dent, ac­cord­ing to US in­tel­li­gence agen­cies, of­fi­cials, re­searchers and ex­perts.</p>
    <p>In a bul­letin less than two weeks be­fore the US elec­tion on Nov 3, US agen­cies said that a Rus­sian group – some­times called Berserk Bear or Dragon­fly by re­searchers – had tar­geted dozens of state, lo­cal, tribal and ter­ri­to­rial US gov­ern­ments, and, in two in­stances, suc­ceeded in steal­ing data.</p>
    <p>The group has pre­vi­ously been ob­served tar­get­ing global crit­i­cal in­fra­struc­ture but, in the past two months, the hack­ers piv­oted “to a heavy fo­cus on state and lo­cal gov­ern­ments,” ac­cord­ing to Ms Sarah Jones, an an­a­lyst with cy­ber-se­cu­rity com­pany FireEye.</p>
    <p>In re­sponse to a re­quest for com­ment, the Rus­sian Em­bassy i n Washington pointed to re­cent com­ments by Krem­lin spokesman Dmitry Peskov call­ing such al­le­ga­tions “ab­so­lutely ground­less”.</p>
    <p>US of­fi­cials were care­ful i n Thurs­day’s warn­ing – which was posted on the web­site of the Cy­ber­se­cu­rity and In­fra­struc­ture Se­cu­rity Agency (Cisa), an arm of the De­part­ment of Home­land Se­cu­rity – to em­pha­sise that they had no in­for­ma­tion to in­di­cate the hack­ers had in­ten­tion­ally dis­rupted any elec­tions or gov­ern­ment op­er­a­tions.</p>
    <p>But the Fed­eral Bureau of In­ves­ti­ga­tion and De­part­ment of Home­land Se­cu­rity said the hack­ing might have had other ma­lign mo­ti­va­tions, such as lay­ing the ground­work for a fu­ture plot.</p>
    <p>The scope of the in­tru­sions was not fully clear. Cisa men­tioned only two vic­tims, and their iden­ti­ties were not re­leased.</p>
    <p>US direc­tor of na­tional in­tel­li­gence John Rat­cliffe an­nounced on Wed­nes­day that Rus­sia and Iran had both tried to in­ter­fere with the 2020 pres­i­den­tial elec­tion, seek­ing to un­der­mine Amer­i­cans’ con­fi­dence in the in­tegrity of the vote and spread mis­in­for­ma­tion in an at­tempt to sway its out­come.</p>
    <p>Mr Rat­cliffe said that Rus­sia ob­tained voter in­for­ma­tion and Iran sent spoofed e-mails to US vot­ers in an at­tempt to in­tim­i­date them.</p>
    <p>Few de­tails of the Rus­sian tar­get­ing were made public, but Reuters re­ported that, in the Ira­nian case, a mis­take by the hack­ers in a video at­tached to the e-mails meant that of­fi­cials were able to iden­tify them al­most im­me­di­ately.</p>
    <p>Speak­ing to CNN, White House chief of staff Mark Mead­ows said that the Ira­nian e-mails af­fected “less than 10,000 peo­ple”.</p>
    <p>“Ev­ery per­son and ev­ery vote counts but there’s no bal­lots that are be­ing ma­nip­u­lated,” he said.</p>
