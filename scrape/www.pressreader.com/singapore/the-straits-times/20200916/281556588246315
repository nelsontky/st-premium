    <p>Chi­nese tech­nol­ogy gi­ant Ten­cent Hold­ings is set­ting up its re­gional hub in Sin­ga­pore as it ex­pands fur­ther into South-east Asia. Ten­cent said that it is ex­pand­ing its pres­ence here to sup­port its grow­ing busi­ness in South-east Asia and be­yond, with the new of­fice a “strate­gic ad­di­tion” to fa­cil­i­ties in Malaysia, In­done­sia and Thai­land.</p>
    <p>Chi­nese tech gi­ant Ten­cent Hold­ings is set­ting up its re­gional hub in Sin­ga­pore as it ex­pands fur­ther into South-east Asia.</p>
    <p>The move comes as geopo­lit­i­cal ten­sions with the United States and In­dia have prompted tech heavy­weights from China such as ByteDance and Alibaba to re­fo­cus their growth ef­forts in Sin­ga­pore and the re­gion.</p>
    <p>Ten­cent said yes­ter­day that it is ex­pand­ing its pres­ence here to sup­port its grow­ing busi­ness in South­east Asia and be­yond, with the new of­fice a “strate­gic ad­di­tion” to fa­cil­i­ties in Malaysia, In­done­sia and Thai­land. “The Sin­ga­pore of­fice will also en­able us to cap­ture po­ten­tial from the rapid pace of digi­ti­sa­tion and meet the de­mand for In­ter­net-based ser­vices and so­lu­tions in Sin­ga­pore,” it added.</p>
    <p>Ten­cent, which op­er­ates su­per­app WeChat, has been con­sid­er­ing shift­ing some busi­ness op­er­a­tions, in­clud­ing in­ter­na­tional game publishing, out of China, sources told Bloomberg.</p>
    <p>Its hir­ing site and post­ings through re­cruiters on Sin­ga­pore’s na­tional jobs por­tal MyCa­reer­sFu­ture.sg notes that it has open­ings for soft­ware engi­neer­ing, busi­ness de­vel­op­ment and le­gal roles here.</p>
    <p>Mr Flo­rian Hoppe, who leads the Asia-Pa­cific dig­i­tal prac­tice at con­sult­ing firm Bain & Com­pany, said the com­mit­ment of Chi­nese firms like Ten­cent to set up here fur­ther so­lid­i­fies Sin­ga­pore’s tech cre­den­tials.</p>
    <p>“Given the current vec­tor of the labour mar­ket, this is typ­i­cally a net pos­i­tive for the whole econ­omy (with) more high-value jobs in the coun­try,” he said, not­ing that there are a mix of jobs on of­fer and not all are spe­cial­ist tech-re­lated roles.</p>
    <p>Ac­cen­ture soft­ware and plat­forms in­dus­try lead Shaikh Is­mail noted: “By bring­ing their ex­ten­sive global ex­per­tise and knowl­edge to our shores, tech com­pa­nies can help Sin­ga­pore busi­nesses cre­ate new busi­ness mod­els and com­pete more ef­fec­tively, and cre­ate prod­ucts that de­liver on an in­ter­na­tional scale.”</p>
    <p>The Ten­cent move also puts re­newed focus on the lo­cal tech ta­lent pool.</p>
    <p>Pro­fes­sor Wong Poh Kam from the Na­tional Univer­sity of Sin­ga­pore’s Busi­ness School said the im­me­di­ate im­pact of the en­trance of these Chi­nese tech giants would de­pend on the roles and pay pack­ages they of­fer. There could be a short­term hit to lo­cal tech com­pa­nies as they may not be able to com­pete fi­nan­cially with the Chi­nese firms for top tech ta­lent, he noted.</p>
    <p>Deloitte South-east Asia tech­nol­ogy sec­tor leader Ni­cholas Chan said the ed­u­ca­tion sys­tem will need to meet the de­mand for tech engi­neer­ing ta­lent – both in terms of quan­tity and qual­ity – in the im­me­di­ate to medium term.</p>
    <p>But for the longer haul, sup­ply short­ages will be ad­dressed by ei­ther im­port­ing over­seas ta­lent or through work­ers com­ing through lo­cal in­sti­tu­tions, he said.</p>
    <p>“For Sin­ga­pore to con­tinue its role in the tech in­dus­try, it needs to be an in­no­va­tor and in­cu­ba­tor for home-grown start-ups to ac­cess the broader Asean mar­ket and rely less on tech firms with head­quar­ters-cum-sales and ad­min­is­tra­tion of­fices re­port­ing back to China or the US,” Mr Chan added.</p>
    <p>The focus for Chi­nese firms in their ex­pan­sion here is the re­gional mar­ket and op­por­tu­ni­ties to cap­ture the growth in South-east Asia’s emerg­ing mar­kets, Prof Wong said.</p>
    <p>“As they grow more in the re­gion, they prob­a­bly need to hire more peo­ple who have con­nec­tions (to) or know-how to ex­pand in the re­gion,” he added, not­ing that knowl­edge of re­gional lan­guages would likely be a val­ued skill and could be an area that Sin­ga­pore­ans look to im­prove on.</p>
