    <p>He has lived in Bri­tain, France, Italy, Dubai and Sin­ga­pore, but only one of these places “feels like home” to 45-year-old Fran­cis (not his real name) ev­ery time he touches down at its air­port.</p>
    <p>“When we land in Changi, it just al­ways feels good to be back. It’s true,” says the Bri­tish ex­pa­tri­ate who has been based in Sin­ga­pore since 2012.</p>
    <p>His ex­pe­ri­ence ap­pears in sync with Sin­ga­pore’s high rank­ings across global sur­veys of the best over­all des­ti­na­tions for ex­pats.</p>
    <p>Af­ter hold­ing first place i n HSBC’s pop­u­lar an­nual Ex­pat Ex­plorer sur­vey for four straight years, Sin­ga­pore fin­ished just be­hind Switzer­land in the lat­est 2019 poll, and re­mains the only Asian lo­ca­tion in the top three.</p>
    <p>Yet a closer look at the sur­vey’s “Liv­ing” pil­lar, with its spe­cific ques­tions on “open and wel­com­ing com­mu­ni­ties” as well as “ease of set­tling in”, re­veals a more mod­est rank­ing of 15th across both ar­eas.</p>
    <p>Sim­i­larly, in a 2019 sur­vey by In­terNa­tions – a global net­work of 1.8 mil­lion ex­pats – Sin­ga­pore comes in at a re­spectable fourth place among cities. But zoom in on the cat­e­gory of “ease of set­tling in” and Sin­ga­pore ranks 11th; for the cat­e­gories of “friend­li­ness” and “find­ing friends”, it falls out­side the top 15.</p>
    <p>Con­versely, a study by the In­sti­tute of Pol­icy Stud­ies and racial har­mony ad­vo­cacy group OnePeo­ple.sg, which ran from 2018 to last year, found that 67 per cent of over 4,000 Sin­ga­pore cit­i­zens and per­ma­nent res­i­dents (PRs) polled felt that im­mi­grants were not do­ing enough to in­te­grate into Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>Since then, Covid-19, a stricken econ­omy, job losses, tight­ened poli­cies on for­eign hir­ing and xeno­pho­bic on­line chat­ter have left some ex­pa­tri­ates feel­ing un­wel­come in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>Those In­sight spoke to have had vary­ing de­grees of lo­cal in­ter­ac­tion, but all ac­knowl­edge that the onus is on them to do more and make a con­scious ef­fort to bet­ter in­te­grate.</p>
    <p>As­so­ci­ate Professor Leong ChanHoong of the Sin­ga­pore Univer­sity of So­cial Sci­ences says that to be suc­cess­ful, in­te­gra­tion needs to rise above su­per­fi­cial lev­els to take on a more in­ti­mate, deeper level of un­der­stand­ing be­tween par­ties.</p>
    <p>“It’s a two-way street; it takes both to tango,” he notes. “So Sin­ga­pore­ans must keep their minds open, but ex­pats, at what­ever level, also need to re­spect lo­cal cul­ture.”</p>
    <p>REACH­ING BE­YOND “BUB­BLES”</p>
    <p>For Prof Leong, the school sys­tem is one ap­proach to bet­ter lo­cal-for­eigner in­te­gra­tion.</p>
    <p>“Among ex­pats, ed­u­ca­tion is an im­por­tant com­po­nent for their kids as well,” he ob­serves. “Mov­ing for­ward, per­haps we can con­sider to what ex­tent we can al­low Sin­ga­pore’s ed­u­ca­tion sys­tem to i ncrease in­take of for­eign stu­dents into both ‘good’ schools and neigh­bour­hood schools.”</p>
    <p>In­ter­na­tional stu­dents can ap­ply to lo­cal schools but there are lim­ited places and Sin­ga­pore cit­i­zens and PRs are pri­ori­tised.</p>
    <p>“If the (for­eign) child is i mmersed i n the l ocal cul­ture or school sys­tem, then that will have the ef­fect of cas­cad­ing to the par­ents, the fam­ily,” says Prof Leong.</p>
    <p>“And Sin­ga­pore­ans can also have a bet­ter ap­pre­ci­a­tion of what these fam­i­lies can bring.”</p>
    <p>Dr Mathew Mathews from the In­sti­tute of Pol­icy Stud­ies at the Na­tional Univer­sity of Sin­ga­pore also called on busi­nesses that em­ploy ex­pats to do their part.</p>
    <p>“They could high­light to their hires that their ex­pe­ri­ence in Sin­ga­pore could be greatly en­hanced if they in­te­grate with Sin­ga­pore­ans not only at the work­place, but also at the neigh­bour­hood and broader so­ci­etal lev­els,” he says.</p>
    <p>“There prob­a­bly could be more lo­cal ground-up ini­tia­tives too, which of­fer op­por­tu­ni­ties for ex­pats to in­ter­act with Sin­ga­pore­ans from a range of back­grounds in mean­ing­ful ways.”</p>
    <p>A Bangladesh­i pro­fes­sional in Sin­ga­pore on an Em­ploy­ment Pass, who wants to be known only as Manas, points out that lo­cals lead very “self-suf­fi­cient” lives.</p>
    <p>“You al­ready know your peo­ple around you, so you don’t feel the need to see the for­eigner who might be liv­ing just next door. So maybe that’s some­thing that has to change a lit­tle – for lo­cals to reach out,” he sug­gests.</p>
    <p>But Manas, 25, also feels that ex­pats keep too much to them­selves. “Most of the pro­grammes the Ben­gali com­mu­nity would do are based on the Ben­gali Com­mu­nity Sin­ga­pore and the Sin­ga­pore Bangladesh So­ci­ety. These are very coun­try­based, as op­posed to some­thing more holis­tic with more peo­ple at­tend­ing.”</p>
    <p>Dr Mathews says the for­eign­ers would do well to find ways to con­nect with “or­di­nary” Sin­ga­pore­ans, rather than stay­ing in their “ex­pat bub­bles”.</p>
    <p>A spokesman for the Min­istry of Cul­ture, Com­mu­nity and Youth notes, though: “These things take time. For­eign­ers must show some will­ing­ness to learn and adapt to lo­cal norms. Lo­cals can do their part by be­ing in­clu­sive, pa­tient and reach­ing out to new­com­ers.”</p>
    <p>For engi­neer “JD”, a PR orig­i­nally from France, sport is the an­swer.</p>
    <p>“I did rock-climb­ing for more than 10 years, where there were all kinds of na­tion­al­i­ties, and right now I’m play­ing disc golf with peo­ple from ev­ery­where too. I would say sport is the eas­i­est way to get to know the lo­cal peo­ple,” says the 37-year-old.</p>
    <p>Other ex­pats say that re­gard­less of the medium, the an­swer lies in prop­erly get­ting to know the other per­son, and reach­ing a stage where pre­con­ceived ideas fall away.</p>
    <p>“I think ex­pats need to just ac­tu­ally start making friends with Sin­ga­pore­ans,” says Tom, a Bri­tish ci­ti­zen who has been based in Sin­ga­pore since 2010.</p>
    <p>“Ac­cept that you are in some­one else’s coun­try, and that you have to adapt, or you will al­ways get an­tifor­eigner sen­ti­ments.</p>
    <p>“Don’t ex­clude your­self from lo­cal so­ci­ety – if you are go­ing to move some­where, then ac­tu­ally live there.”</p>
    <p>TAKE IT TO ANOTHER LEVEL</p>
    <p>They could high­light to their hires that their ex­pe­ri­ence in Sin­ga­pore could be greatly en­hanced if they in­te­grate with Sin­ga­pore­ans not only at the work­place, but also at the neigh­bour­hood and broader so­ci­etal lev­els.</p>
    <p>DR MATHEW MATHEWS from the In­sti­tute of Pol­icy Stud­ies at the Na­tional Univer­sity of Sin­ga­pore, call­ing on busi­nesses that em­ploy ex­pa­tri­ates to do their part to help them in­te­grate with Sin­ga­pore­ans.</p>
