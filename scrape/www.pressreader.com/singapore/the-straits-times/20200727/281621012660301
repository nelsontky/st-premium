    <p>The lat­est changes to the Cabi­net by Prime Min­is­ter Lee Hsien Loong in the wake of the gen­eral elec­tion re­flect a de­sire not to dis­rupt the mo­men­tum that the Govern­ment has been build­ing in com­bat­ing the Covid-19 pan­demic, said po­lit­i­cal ob­servers.</p>
    <p>They added that the Cabi­net reshuf­fle, an­nounced on Satur­day, also in­di­cates that the suc­ces­sion plans for Sin­ga­pore’s lead­er­ship re­main largely un­changed, with pos­si­bly just the time­line af­fected.</p>
    <p>While it was an­nounced that there will be new top ap­point­ments at six out of 15 min­istries, an­a­lysts like Dr Mustafa Iz­zud­din noted that the ones heav­ily in­volved in Sin­ga­pore’s Covid-19 ef­forts, like those in the min­istries of Health, Man­power and Fi­nance, con­tinue to be helmed by the same min­is­ters.</p>
    <p>Dr Mustafa, a se­nior in­ter­na­tional af­fairs an­a­lyst at man­age­ment con­sul­tancy So­laris Strate­gies Sin­ga­pore, said that this was one of the “least dis­rup­tive” Cabi­net reshuf­fles Sin­ga­pore has seen.</p>
    <p>“We do ex­pect that the main min­istries fight­ing Covid-19 to re­main in­tact. I think it is im­por­tant to do so be­cause we are still in the midst of bat­tling this pan­demic, and we will be do­ing so for quite some time to come,” he said.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore Man­age­ment Univer­sity (SMU) as­so­ciate pro­fes­sor of law Eu­gene Tan said the reshuf­fle this time has a fo­cus on con­ti­nu­ity.</p>
    <p>“In the crisis, for front-line min­istries, you don’t want to change cap­tains in the mid­dle of nav­i­gat­ing treach­er­ous wa­ters,” he said.</p>
    <p>“PM Lee seems to be sat­is­fied that th­ese in­cum­bents are do­ing a good job, and feels that they will con­tinue to do so as we han­dle the Covid-19 sit­u­a­tion.”</p>
    <p>Ob­servers also noted that Satur­day’s an­nounce­ments show that there are un­likely to be ma­jor changes to the plans for Sin­ga­pore’s lead­er­ship tran­si­tion, with some of them say­ing Deputy Prime Min­is­ter Heng Swee Keat re­mains the top choice to take over from PM Lee.</p>
    <p>In ad­di­tion to his roles as Deputy Prime Min­is­ter and Fi­nance Min­is­ter, Mr Heng will be des­ig­nated Co­or­di­nat­ing Min­is­ter for Eco­nomic Poli­cies. PM Lee noted on Satur­day that Mr Heng had al­ready been play­ing this role in the last term, and the des­ig­na­tion for­malises ex­ist­ing ar­range­ments.</p>
    <p>Na­tional Univer­sity of Sin­ga­pore (NUS) so­ci­ol­o­gist Tan Ern Ser said this is a strong in­di­ca­tor that Mr Heng is still the front run­ner to even­tu­ally take over as prime min­is­ter.</p>
    <p>Se­nior Min­is­ter Teo Chee Hean con­tin­ues as Co­or­di­nat­ing Min­is­ter for Na­tional Se­cu­rity, and Se­nior Min­is­ter Thar­man Shan­mu­garat­nam as Co­or­di­nat­ing Min­is­ter for So­cial Poli­cies.</p>
    <p>In the July 10 gen­eral elec­tion, the five-mem­ber Peo­ple’s Ac­tion Party (PAP) team led by Mr Heng in East Coast GRC saw its vote share fall from 60.7 per cent to 53.4 per cent of the vote – a smaller swing than the PAP’s 8.7 per­cent­age point na­tion­wide drop to 61.2 per cent. The PAP’s vote share in the GRC has been below the na­tional av­er­age in the past few elec­tions, but even so, some ob­servers raised ques­tions about Mr Heng’s po­lit­i­cal fu­ture.</p>
    <p>While some ob­servers have com­mented that the re­sult could af­fect his chances to take over as prime min­is­ter, SMU’s Prof Tan said Satur­day’s an­nounce­ment made clear that this is not the case.</p>
    <p>He said: “PM Lee and the 4G lead­ers do not see the elec­tion re­sult in East Coast GRC in the same light as seg­ments of the public or some com­men­ta­tors have seen it. Re­gard­less of the elec­tion out­come, the 4G lead­ers are back­ing Mr Heng. With the ad­di­tional ap­point­ment that has been given to him, it af­firms that there is no change for now in the lead­er­ship suc­ces­sion plan.”</p>
    <p>As­so­ciate Pro­fes­sor Bil­veer Singh from NUS’ po­lit­i­cal sci­ence depart­ment felt that to change Mr Heng as the front run­ner might send a sig­nal that there is pol­i­tick­ing within the PAP and that the wrong choice was made.</p>
    <p>Be­sides the ad­di­tional role given to Mr Heng, ex­perts also high­lighted that the moves of other 4G min­is­ters can be seen as a way for them to gain more ex­pe­ri­ence.</p>
    <p>D r Mu s t a f a n o t e d t h a t Mr Lawrence Wong’s shift from the Min­istry of Na­tional De­vel­op­ment (MND) to the Min­istry of Ed­u­ca­tion (MOE), and Mr Ong Ye Kung’s move from MOE to the Min­istry of Trans­port are meant to ex­pose them to the work of min­istries they might not have been fa­mil­iar with.</p>
    <p>“It looks like PM Lee wants to move th­ese min­is­ters around so that they can learn more. Be­sides, there was also a need to get a new min­is­ter for trans­port,” said Dr Mustafa, re­fer­ring to out­go­ing Trans­port Min­is­ter Khaw Boon Wan’s re­tire­ment from pol­i­tics.</p>
    <p>Mr Wong’s move likely stemmed from his per­for­mance lead­ing the multi-min­istry task force ad­dress­ing the Covid-19 sit­u­a­tion, said As­sis­tant Pro­fes­sor Walid Jum­blatt Ab­dul­lah, a po­lit­i­cal sci­en­tist from Nanyang Tech­no­log­i­cal Univer­sity.</p>
    <p>NUS’ As­so­ciate Pro­fes­sor Tan de­scribed Mr Wong’s move from MND to MOE as a “lat­eral move to another key min­istry” in or­der to give him more ex­po­sure.</p>
    <p>Mr Wong was a min­is­ter of state at MOE when he first en­tered pol­i­tics in 2011, and led a re­view of univer­sity ed­u­ca­tion that rec­om­mended rais­ing the co­hort par­tic­i­pa­tion rate to 40 per cent and widened the range of univer­sity de­grees.</p>
    <p>For other 4G lead­ers such as Mr Masa­gos Zulk­i­fli and Mr Ed­win Tong, their new ap­point­ments will be the first time they have been of­fice-hold­ers in that par­tic­u­lar min­istry.</p>
    <p>Mr Masa­gos will leave the Min­istry of the En­vi­ron­ment and Wa­ter Re­sources, which will be re­named the Min­istry of Sus­tain­abil­ity and the En­vi­ron­ment, for the Min­istry of So­cial and Fam­ily De­vel­op­ment, and Mr Tong will be the Min­is­ter for Cul­ture, Com­mu­nity and Youth.</p>
    <p>Prof Walid said that while the min­is­ters have a shorter run­way, they will work with civil ser­vants who have been there much longer and can lend their ex­pe­ri­ence.</p>
