    <p>Miss Tan Li Ling re­mem­bers try­ing to hold on to one of her pupils – even as he grabbed and pulled her hair – to stop him from hurt­ing him­self.</p>
    <p>The Pri­mary 1 pupil at Gey­lang Methodist School (Pri­mary) had anger man­age­ment is­sues and was act­ing out in class.</p>
    <p>Af­ter that in­ci­dent in 2017, the school spoke with the boy’s par­ents and with other teach­ers who wished to help.</p>
    <p>It was later found that he needed spe­cial ed­u­ca­tion.</p>
    <p>To help him feel at ease and give him peer sup­port, Miss Tan en­cour­aged other pupils to make friends and play with him dur­ing re­cess. She also spent time talk­ing to him and try­ing to forge a bond. The boy is now in Pri­mary 4 and do­ing well in school. To this day, Miss Tan has a good re­la­tion­ship with him.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, the 47-year-old was one of three re­cip­i­ents of the Na­tional Level Award at the Car­ing Teacher Awards 2020. Seven other teach­ers re­ceived the Na­tional Com­men­da­tion Award.</p>
    <p>The 10 win­ners were se­lected out of over 5,800 nom­i­na­tions across 225 schools.</p>
    <p>The awards “recog­nise the crit­i­cal role that teach­ers play over­all, en­sur­ing that learn­ing con­tin­ues, even dur­ing a pan­demic, and that all stu­dents are still be­ing cared for”, said the Na­tional In­sti­tute of Ed­u­ca­tion (NIE) at Nanyang Tech­no­log­i­cal Univer­sity, which or­gan­ises the event.</p>
    <p>This is the 13th edi­tion of the awards, which are sup­ported by ExxonMo­bil Asia Pa­cific and the</p>
    <p>Min­istry of Ed­u­ca­tion.</p>
    <p>Miss Tan, who has been teach­ing English, math­e­mat­ics and so­cial stud­ies for 20 years, said: “I see that as a teacher, my job doesn’t stop af­ter I take a class for a year. The process should be like a cy­cle, where we sup­port the child all the way to Pri­mary 6 and fur­ther on, if he or she wants to stay in touch with us.</p>
    <p>“I be­lieve each child has a gift wait­ing to be un­wrapped. As teach­ers, we have to help them dis­cover their strengths and tap their po­ten­tial.”</p>
    <p>She added that she is thank­ful for her fel­low teach­ers and col­leagues.</p>
    <p>“It takes more than just one per­son to help a par­tic­u­lar child. Ev­ery­one – from the teach­ers to the can­teen ven­dors and staff in the school – plays a part.”</p>
    <p>As­so­ciate Pro­fes­sor Ivy Tan from NIE, who is the chair­man of this year’s awards or­gan­is­ing com­mit­tee and also sits on the panel of judges, said the three na­tional-level win­ners were “unan­i­mously se­lected”. “The tes­ti­monies re­lated by the prin­ci­pals, col­leagues, par­ents and stu­dents who have sup­ported the nom­i­na­tions of the win­ners... were heart-warm­ing and up­lift­ing,” said Prof Tan.</p>
    <p>“The award win­ners’ val­ues of car­ing and go­ing be­yond their call of duty to be the wind be­neath the wings for their stu­dents are most ad­mirable and es­pe­cially much needed dur­ing this pe­riod of the (Covid-19) pan­demic.”</p>
    <p>Be­sides Miss Tan, the other two win­ners are Madam Norul Ashiqin Rashid from Merid­ian Sec­ondary School and Dr Bernard Ri­cardo from the NUS High School of Math­e­mat­ics and Sci­ence.</p>
    <p>Madam Norul, 39, a chem­istry teacher, said this is the high­est ac­co­lade she has re­ceived in her 15 years of teach­ing.</p>
    <p>“I love in­ter­act­ing and im­part­ing my knowl­edge and skills to (stu­dents). It gives me a sense of ful­fil­ment when I know that they have grown, both aca­dem­i­cally and (in terms of ma­tu­rity),” she said.</p>
    <p>“What’s amaz­ing is that I al­ways get to learn some­thing new. There are lots of op­por­tu­ni­ties for learn­ing, and I’m also see­ing my­self grow­ing and de­vel­op­ing pro­fes­sion­ally year by year.”</p>
    <p>Dr Ri­cardo, 35, who teaches physics, said: “Be­ing a teacher is not about the ti­tle, but about the im­pact we make. I love teach­ing as it al­lows me to im­part val­ues be­yond knowl­edge to the stu­dents.”</p>
    <p>LIFE­LONG COM­MIT­MENT</p>
    <p>I see that as a teacher, my job doesn’t stop af­ter I take a class for a year. The process should be like a cy­cle, where we sup­port the child all the way to Pri­mary 6 and fur­ther on, if he or she wants to stay in touch with us... I be­lieve each child has a gift wait­ing to be un­wrapped. As teach­ers, we have to help them dis­cover their strengths and tap their po­ten­tial.</p>
