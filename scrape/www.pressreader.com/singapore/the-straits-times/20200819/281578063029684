    <p>In­dia’s rul­ing Bharatiya Janata Party’s (BJP) slick ap­proach to new me­dia has turned con­tro­ver­sial after The Wall Street Journal re­ported that Face­book em­ploy­ees were tilted in favour of the party. Op­po­si­tion par­ties are now seek­ing a probe into the al­le­ga­tions.</p>
    <p>The rul­ing Bharatiya Janata Party’s (BJP) ef­fec­tive use of so­cial me­dia to spread its po­lit­i­cal mes­sage and ide­ol­ogy dur­ing elec­tions and oth­er­wise is well doc­u­mented.</p>
    <p>The BJP has an edge over other par­ties in the field with a well-oiled ma­chin­ery that uses Face­book and What­sApp, among oth­ers.</p>
    <p>But the slick ap­proach to new me­dia has turned con­tro­ver­sial after the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) re­ported that Face­book em­ploy­ees were tilted in favour of the BJP.</p>
    <p>The WSJ, in an ar­ti­cle on Aug 14, cited ex­am­ples of how Face­book “op­posed ap­ply­ing hate speech rules” to those linked to the Hindu na­tion­al­ist party, in­clud­ing Te­lan­gana BJP lawmaker T. Raja Singh, who called for vi­o­lence against mi­nori­ties.</p>
    <p>The paper cited in­ter­ven­tion by se­nior In­dia ex­ec­u­tives and noted that some of the posts in ques­tion were deleted fol­low­ing in­quiries by the WSJ. Mr Singh has claimed his ac­count was hacked at the time.</p>
    <p>Op­po­si­tion par­ties are now seek­ing a probe into the al­le­ga­tions and dig­i­tal ad­vo­cacy groups are seek­ing an au­dit into the pro­ce­dures fol­lowed by the so­cial me­dia gi­ant to block hate speeches.</p>
    <p>“We can­not al­low any ma­nip­u­la­tion of our hard-earned democ­racy through bias, fake news and hate speech,” tweeted Congress leader Rahul Gandhi.</p>
    <p>His party has asked for a joint par­lia­men­tary com­mit­tee probe and has writ­ten to Face­book chief ex­ec­u­tive Mark Zuckerberg to in­sti­tute an in­quiry into its top rungs in In­dia.</p>
    <p>A panel of the Delhi state as­sem­bly on Mon­day said it would sum­mon Face­book of­fi­cials to ap­pear be­fore it to explain the com­pany’s pol­icy on how it treats hate speech and con­tent.</p>
    <p>This is not the first time such al­le­ga­tions have sur­faced.</p>
    <p>Last year, the is­sue even made it into Par­lia­ment with Tri­namool Party’s Mr Derek O’Brien claim­ing that when elec­tions were held, “Face­book cen­sored anti-BJP news and put other par­ties at jeop­ardy”.</p>
    <p>For Face­book, In­dia is a ma­jor mar­ket. Many peo­ple, par­tic­u­larly in the ru­ral ar­eas and small towns, who gained ac­cess to the In­ter­net via their phones for the first time, are widely us­ing tools like What­sApp.</p>
    <p>In­dia has over 346 mil­lion users of Face­book and 400 mil­lion users of What­sApp.</p>
    <p>All po­lit­i­cal par­ties have been us­ing so­cial me­dia to spread their ide­ol­ogy and po­lit­i­cal mes­sage.</p>
    <p>But con­trol­ling hate speeches amid a deeply po­larised at­mos­phere has re­mained a chal­lenge.</p>
    <p>Now, many are ask­ing whether Face­book is tilted towards the BJP.</p>
    <p>A Face­book spokesman said in a state­ment: “We pro­hibit hate speech and con­tent that incites vi­o­lence and we en­force these poli­cies glob­ally with­out re­gard to any­one’s po­lit­i­cal po­si­tion or party af­fil­i­a­tion.</p>
    <p>“While we know there is more to do, we’re mak­ing progress on en­force­ment and conduct reg­u­lar au­dits of our process to en­sure fair­ness and ac­cu­racy.”</p>
    <p>The so­cial me­dia gi­ant has grow­ing busi­ness in­ter­ests in In­dia.</p>
    <p>Face­book-owned mes­sag­ing plat­form What­sApp is set to launch a pay­ments plat­form.</p>
    <p>Face­book has in­vested US$5.7 bil­lion (S$7.8 bil­lion) in In­dian con­glom­er­ate Reliance In­dus­tries’ Jio Plat­forms.</p>
    <p>The con­tro­versy, an­a­lysts said, was not good for the tech ti­tan.</p>
    <p>“It’s not good for Face­book. For any pro­fes­sional com­pany get­ting in­volved with po­lit­i­cal ac­tiv­ity is un­de­sir­able,” said Pro­fes­sor Jagdeep S. Ch­hokar, founder and trustee of As­so­ci­a­tion for Demo­cratic Re­forms.</p>
    <p>Amid the con­tro­versy, Ms Ankhi Das, a se­nior Face­book ex­ec­u­tive at the cen­tre of the con­tro­versy, filed a po­lice com­plaint, al­leg­ing that she has been re­ceiv­ing “threats to her life” and was “vil­i­fied” after be­ing named in the WSJ report.</p>
    <p>A counter case has been filed against her by jour­nal­ist Awesh Ti­wari, who was named by Ms Das as among those who had threat­ened her. His case re­lates to the al­leged hurt­ing of re­li­gious sen­ti­ments.</p>
