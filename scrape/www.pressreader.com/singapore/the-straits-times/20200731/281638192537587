    <p>Works for Stage 2 of the Thom­sonEast Coast Line (TEL) are pro­gress­ing at a slower pace due to con­straints on worker avail­abil­ity amid the im­pact of Covid-19, said the Land Trans­port Author­ity (LTA).</p>
    <p>The agency is still as­sess­ing the im­pact of the coro­n­avirus pan­demic on the time­line of the open­ing of Stage 2 of the TEL as well as other projects to ex­pand the MRT net­work.</p>
    <p>LTA’s re­marks on the projects were first re­ported by Chi­nese news­pa­per Lianhe Zaobao yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>In March, then Trans­port Min­is­ter Khaw Boon Wan said Stage 2 of TEL was likely to open after this month, fol­low­ing test­ing of the sixs­ta­tion stretch from April to July.</p>
    <p>The sta­tions are Springleaf, Len­tor, Mayflower, Bright Hill, Up­per Thom­son and Calde­cott.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, a spokesman for LTA said con­struc­tion works were al­lowed to re­sume from June 2, pro­vided con­trac­tors com­plied with the Covid-Safe Restart Cri­te­ria. These in­cluded the set­ting up of tem­po­rary work­ers’ quar­ters and car­ry­ing out pe­ri­odic swab tests in ad­di­tion to reg­u­lar tem­per­a­ture screen­ing. Work­ers were also re­quired to com­plete the Covid-Safe Train­ing for Work­ers mo­d­ule be­fore start­ing work.</p>
    <p>Projects that met the cri­te­ria and with a suf­fi­cient num­ber of work­ers had re­sumed work, said the spokesman. “Ex­am­ples in­clude the con­struc­tion of East Coast In­te­grated De­pot, Xilin and Sungei Be­dok sta­tions along Down­town Line 3 ex­ten­sion, Prince Ed­ward sta­tion along Cir­cle Line 6 ex­ten­sion and the up­grad­ing of Tanah Merah sta­tion along East-West Line,” the spokesman added.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, test­ing of the sys­tems and trains along Stage 2 of TEL has been on­go­ing and in­stal­la­tion of some sta­tion equip­ment has re­sumed, but works are pro­gress­ing at a slower pace due to con­straints on worker avail­abil­ity, said the spokesman.</p>
    <p>The spokesman said that more than 90 per cent of over­all works for TEL2 sta­tions and more than 80 per cent of train test­ing for the new sta­tions have been com­pleted.</p>
    <p>“We are still as­sess­ing the im­pact of Covid-19 on the time­line of these projects, in­clud­ing the open­ing time­line for TEL2. Pro­ject time­lines may be ad­justed to en­sure that works can con­tinue safely in com­pli­ance with pub­lic health mea­sures,” said the spokesman.</p>
    <p>“How­ever, the in­tent to sig­nif­i­cantly ex­pand our MRT net­work re­mains un­changed. We will keep the pub­lic in­formed of any changes to pro­ject time­lines.”</p>
    <p>TEL is ex­pected to be com­pleted by 2024, after open­ing in five stages from this year to 2024. In Jan­uary, three sta­tions along the line – Wood­lands North, Wood­lands and Wood­lands South sta­tions – be­gan op­er­at­ing.</p>
    <p>The 43km line will be Sin­ga­pore’s sixth and long­est MRT line, and will add 32 new sta­tions to the ex­ist­ing rail net­work, with eight in­ter­change sta­tions in to­tal.</p>
    <p>When fully op­er­a­tional, the TEL is ex­pected to ini­tially serve around 500,000 com­muters daily, even­tu­ally ris­ing to about one mil­lion.</p>
