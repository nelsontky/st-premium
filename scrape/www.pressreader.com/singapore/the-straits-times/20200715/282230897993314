    <p>(−197.73) July 14 (+10.50) July 13</p>
    <p>Re­gional mar­kets were broadly slower yes­ter­day fol­low­ing an overnight dip in United States tech­nol­ogy heavy­weights that weighed on the S&P 500 index.</p>
    <p>Sen­ti­ment here was also damp­ened by ad­vance es­ti­mates show­ing that sec­ond-quar­ter gross do­mes­tic prod­uct shrank 41.2 per cent from the first to the sec­ond quar­ter com­pared with a 3.3 per cent con­trac­tion in the first three months of the year.</p>
    <p>That sober re­minder of the im­pact Covid-19 is hav­ing on the econ­omy helped send the Straits Times Index (STI) drift­ing through the day to end at 2,620.19, a de­cline of 10.89 points, or 0.41 per cent. Losers beat gain­ers 359 to 140, with 1.72 bil­lion shares worth $1.12 bil­lion chang­ing hands.</p>
    <p>Only four of the STI’s com­po­nent stocks closed in the black. Sing­tel was the most sig­nif­i­cant, end­ing the day at $2.52, up 0.8 per cent.</p>
    <p>Sing­tel said ear­lier this month that its Aus­tralian unit Op­tus will launch its 11th satel­lite de­ployed for Aus­tralia and New Zealand in 2023.</p>
    <p>It also re­cently said it would liq­ui­date its video-stream­ing unit Hooq, which has Sony and Warner Brothers as co-own­ers. South Korean ecom­merce gi­ant Coupang is re­port­edly plan­ning to buy Hooq’s as­sets.</p>
    <p>Among the smaller cap stocks, there was ex­cite­ment around phar­ma­ceu­ti­cal plays.</p>
    <p>Hy­phens Pharma In­ter­na­tional closed at 48 cents, up 50 per cent. The firm said on Mon­day its patent for Cer­adan Ad­vanced, an emol­lient ther­apy for­mu­lated for eczemapron­e skin, has been granted in</p>
    <p>Bri­tain. The patent is also pend­ing ap­proval in 13 other ju­ris­dic­tions.</p>
    <p>iX Bio­pharma shares took off in the af­ter­noon to close at 31.5 cents, up 26 per cent. Two weeks ago, it re­ported “ro­bust up­take” in Aus­tralia for a prod­uct called Xa­tiva since its April launch. Xa­tiva is a medic­i­nal cannabid­iol in a wafer.</p>
    <p>Broad sen­ti­ment was hit af­ter the num­ber of coro­n­avirus in­fec­tions around the world touched 13 mil­lion on Mon­day.</p>
    <p>South Korea closed down 0.11 per cent, even as its gov­ern­ment launched a 114.1 tril­lion won (S$131.8 bil­lion) plan to cre­ate jobs and help the econ­omy re­cover from the pan­demic fall­out, an­chored in part by “green” in­vest­ment in elec­tric ve­hi­cles and hy­dro­gen cars.</p>
    <p>Ja­pan closed 0.87 per cent lower, while Hong Kong shed 1.14 per cent. Aus­tralia ended 0.61 per cent down.</p>
    <p>“There is a risk that the di­ver­gence be­tween a gloomy eco­nomic out­look and un­ex­pect­edly strong re­turns from eq­uity mar­kets is rec­on­ciled by some pull­back in as­set prices rather than a surge in eco­nomic op­ti­mism,” Mr Chris Iggo of AXA In­vest­ment Man­agers told Agence FrancePres­se. “There is a case for cau­tion.”</p>
