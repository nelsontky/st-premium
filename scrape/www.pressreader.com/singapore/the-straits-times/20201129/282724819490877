    <p>Whether you’re a sea­soned ath­lete or some­one start­ing out, we all have days when we don’t feel like do­ing any­thing, much less go­ing for a run. And in long-dis­tance vir­tual events, such as The Straits Times Vir­tual Run’s 175km race – which was cre­ated to mark the pa­per’s 175th an­niver­sary – it may not be easy to keep up your mo­men­tum for a long time.</p>
    <p>Here are some ways to stay mo­ti­vated:</p>
    <p>1 MIX IT UP</p>
    <p>Vary your run­ning routes, dis­tance as well as types of runs (for ex­am­ple, in­ter­vals, long-slow dis­tance, etc). Choose a new place to ex­plore – whether it is a neigh­bour­hood or the city. Change the time that you run too. The con­di­tions at var­i­ous lo­ca­tions will look and feel dif­fer­ent de­pend­ing on whether it is in the morn­ing, evening or at night.</p>
    <p>Chang­ing your rou­tine will help you stay fresh and give you some­thing to look for­ward to at each ses­sion. You can also vary the type of ex­er­cise you do. Other sports such as swim­ming or bad­minton will help to build up dif­fer­ent mus­cle groups and im­prove car­dio­vas­cu­lar health.</p>
    <p>2 REST AND RECHARGE</p>
    <p>Hav­ing am­ple rest in be­tween runs is im­por­tant to re­duce the chances of fa­tigue and a weak­ened im­mune sys­tem. When you feel recharged, you will re­duce your chances of dread­ing your ex­er­cise and pro­mote bet­ter per­for­mance.</p>
    <p>3 PACE YOUR­SELF</p>
    <p>Take note of your run­ning pace as it may af­fect your mind­set dur­ing the run. Start­ing off at a very fast pace tends to re­sult in run­ners strug­gling later, which may lead to a neg­a­tive mind­set and re­duced mo­ti­va­tion.</p>
    <p>Make it a habit to start runs con­ser­va­tively and al­low the body to warm up. This will also en­sure there is ad­e­quate en­ergy to last through­out the run and re­duce the chances of in­jury.</p>
    <p>4 RUN WITH OTH­ERS</p>
    <p>Friends are one of the big­gest mo­ti­va­tors you can have. Grab a buddy to run with you. Bud­dies can share ad­vice and tips and en­sure that each keeps to his/her plan. Gather a group of friends – with cur­rent Covid-19 guide­lines in mind – and to­gether, plan a sched­ule or goal for each run. Ex­plore your strengths and lim­its to­gether. You can ven­ture to dif­fer­ent places around Sin­ga­pore to stave off bore­dom.</p>
    <p>Apart from run­ning to­gether as a group, you can also ini­ti­ate friendly chal­lenges to mo­ti­vate each other to im­prove and have fun at the same time.</p>
    <p>5 CHOOSE YOUR COURSE</p>
    <p>Un­like an ac­tual race, the ST Vir­tual Run gives par­tic­i­pants the free­dom to choose their run­ning route.</p>
    <p>Take this chance to map out the route that you feel most com­fort­able on and avoid the types of routes you dis­like, for ex­am­ple, climbs. You may also use dif­fer­ent ways to mo­ti­vate your­self, such as run­ning in loops and count­ing down the num­ber of laps left. Lap run­ning al­lows run­ners to work on their men­tal strength.</p>
    <p>6 MU­SIC AS A COM­PAN­ION</p>
    <p>A run­ning buddy can also be in the form of mu­sic or a pod­cast. Lis­ten­ing to your favourite songs can get you hyped up. Cre­ate a playlist of your favourite mu­sic and up­beat songs to keep you mov­ing. But re­mem­ber to stay alert and con­scious of your sur­round­ings. I rec­om­mend us­ing only one side of your ear­piece or low­er­ing the vol­ume to en­sure you will still be able to hear what is go­ing on around you.</p>
    <p>7 CHAL­LENGE OTH­ERS</p>
    <p>Be­sides com­pet­ing against your bud­dies, you can also mea­sure your­self against oth­ers who pass through the same sec­tions in your route or on­line. You can share your re­sults (for ex­am­ple, speed or dis­tance) on a com­mon plat­form or even over so­cial me­dia or chats.</p>
    <p>By hav­ing an in­ter­est group on so­cial me­dia plat­forms, you can com­pare your re­sults even out­side Sin­ga­pore and this con­stant de­sire to reach the top can be a healthy mo­ti­va­tion for run­ners.</p>
    <p>8 AL­LOW OTH­ERS TO TRACK YOU</p>
    <p>Var­i­ous smart­watches and run­ning apps now come equipped with live track­ing and can be shared with friends who will be able to fol­low your live progress dur­ing runs. You will not want to dis­ap­point them, know­ing that they are there to sup­port you.</p>
    <p>9 RE­WARD YOUR­SELF</p>
    <p>Treat­ing our­selves to a good meal or mas­sage can help to recharge our phys­i­cal and men­tal selves. Oc­ca­sion­ally, get­ting new gear can also help you to re­in­force your com­mit­ment to train­ing and reignite the ex­cite­ment of run­ning. Re­ward your­self with rest days as well, by plan­ning your run sched­ule to in­clude rest days and a re­cov­ery week (prefer­ably one out of five weeks) with cross-train­ing or lower mileage.</p>
    <p>10 THINK OF THE BEN­E­FITS</p>
    <p>Clock­ing your miles early will al­low you to en­joy the seren­ity of the morn­ing. Think of your run as time for your­self, a mini “get­away” from the hus­tle and bus­tle of your daily rou­tine.</p>
    <p>Last of all, don’t wait for that “mo­ment” when you feel it’s time to go for a run, be­cause that “mo­ment” is cre­ated by you.</p>
