    <p>NEW YORK • This month, many col­leges around the United States plan to wel­come back thou­sands of stu­dents into some­thing they hope will re­sem­ble nor­mal cam­pus life.</p>
    <p>But they face chal­lenges un­like any other Amer­i­can in­sti­tu­tion: Con­tain­ing the coro­n­avirus among a young, im­pul­sive pop­u­la­tion that not only stud­ies to­gether, but lives to­gether, par­ties to­gether, and, if decades of his­tory are any guide, sleeps to­gether.</p>
    <p>It will be a hugely com­plex and costly en­deav­our re­quir­ing far more than just the re­con­fig­ur­ing of dor­mi­tory rooms and cafe­te­rias and the con­struc­tion of an­nexes and tent class­rooms to in­crease so­cial dis­tanc­ing.</p>
    <p>It also cru­cially in­volves the cre­ation of test­ing pro­grammes ca­pa­ble of serv­ing com­mu­ni­ties the size of small cities and the en­force­ment of codes of con­duct among stu­dents not ea­ger to be po­liced.</p>
    <p>Who will be tested for the coro­n­avirus and how quickly can they get re­sults? Will mask wear­ing be man­dated? And what will hap­pen to tail­gat­ing, keg par­ties and sneak­ing into your part­ner’s dorm room?</p>
    <p>Col­leges are map­ping strate­gies as var­ied as the con­trast­ing Covid-19 reg­u­la­tions en­acted by the dif­fer­ent Amer­i­can states, re­flect­ing the cul­ture and lead­er­ship of their schools.</p>
    <p>Syra­cuse Univer­sity is vow­ing to play the strict par­ent, re­quir­ing stu­dents to sign codes of con­duct with penal­ties for vi­o­lat­ing Covid-19 rules more se­vere than the pun­ish­ment for smok­ing mar­i­juana.</p>
    <p>But the Univer­sity of Ken­tucky is pre­sent­ing a more le­nient front, adopt­ing ex­ist­ing hon­our codes that urge stu­dents to “pro­mote per­sonal re­spon­si­bil­ity and peer ac­count­abil­ity”.</p>
    <p>And the Univer­sity of Texas</p>
    <p>Austin has pro­hib­ited stu­dents from hold­ing par­ties on or off cam­pus, banned overnight guests in dorm rooms and warned stu­dents that they can be dis­ci­plined for “pur­pose­fully in­vad­ing the per­sonal space of oth­ers”, at least with­out a face mask on.</p>
    <p>All of th­ese ef­forts are com­ing at great cost, po­ten­tially adding more than US$70 bil­lion (S$96.4 bil­lion) to the bud­gets of the coun­try’s 5,000 col­leges.</p>
    <p>Yet, col­lege ad­min­is­tra­tors say that giv­ing their con­stituents – stu­dents and their fam­i­lies – at least a taste of col­lege life is worth it, if done in the safest pos­si­ble way.</p>
    <p>Whether those con­stituents agree is an open ques­tion, and com­plaints about tu­ition costs have led a grow­ing num­ber of schools to of­fer re­bates.</p>
    <p>It is still pos­si­ble that the fran­tic plan­ning will come to naught. Al­most daily, uni­ver­si­ties that had re­leased de­tailed plans for in-per­son classes this se­mes­ter have re­versed th­ese and said they will go al­most en­tirely on­line.</p>
    <p>Last Fri­day, the Univer­sity of Penn­syl­va­nia be­came the lat­est, an­nounc­ing that al­most all un­der­grad­u­ate classes would be taught on­line and that un­der­grad­u­ates re­turn­ing to Philadelph­ia, re­gard­less of whether they were liv­ing on cam­pus, would have to take a min­i­mum of two Covid-19 tests to par­tic­i­pate in any Penn ac­tiv­i­ties this au­tumn.</p>
    <p>“We have learnt how to close safely,” said Mr Hi­ram Cho­dosh, pres­i­dent of Clare­mont McKenna Col­lege, a lib­eral arts school in Clare­mont, Cal­i­for­nia. “But the big ques­tion now is, can we open safely?”</p>
    <p>Test­ing ca­pac­ity, a prob­lem in com­mu­ni­ties through­out the coun­try, varies widely among schools, and could play a ma­jor role in whether they can re­main open dur­ing an outbreak.</p>
    <p>Big schools, from Syra­cuse Univer­sity to the Univer­sity of Cal­i­for­nia, San Diego, that have con­nec­tions to labs, health pro­grammes or med­i­cal schools say they are ca­pa­ble of pro­cess­ing large num­bers of Covid-19 tests in 24 to 48 hours.</p>
    <p>But lit­tle Cor­nell Col­lege in Iowa, with only 1,000 stu­dents, is not do­ing univer­sal test­ing on ar­rival, believ­ing that it would give a false sense of se­cu­rity be­cause of the in­cu­ba­tion pe­riod.</p>
    <p>The school will be do­ing ran­domised rapid test­ing of 3 per cent of its asymp­to­matic stu­dents per week through its health cen­tre, which will take just a few minutes to get re­sults. It will re­serve the more so­phis­ti­cated test­ing, with the help of the county health depart­ment, for stu­dents who show symp­toms.</p>
    <p>Other small schools in sim­i­lar sit­u­a­tions are find­ing them­selves at the mercy of pri­vate labs that can take days to de­liver re­sults, mak­ing re­sults al­most mean­ing­less.</p>
    <p>Equally daunt­ing is the task of reg­u­lat­ing the be­hav­iour of an age group known for its risk-tak­ing be­hav­iour. Many schools have adopted so­cial com­pacts and be­hav­iour codes.</p>
    <p>Masks are a key part of al­most every code, to be worn ex­cept in sit­u­a­tions like brush­ing teeth, walk­ing alone out­side or be­ing alone in a dorm room. Most ban par­ty­ing or so­cial­is­ing out­side “so­cial pods” – the small groups of stu­dents that some col­leges are as­sign­ing stu­dents to, usu­ally based on their dorms.</p>
    <p>Penal­ties for code vi­o­la­tions range from be­ing kicked out of class and coun­selled, to evic­tion from cam­pus hous­ing and ex­pul­sion.</p>
    <p>The word “sex” is not men­tioned in the typ­i­cal be­hav­iour code. Some col­leges may try to pro­hibit overnight vis­its in dorms, and many are stress­ing the ob­vi­ous risks in­ti­mate con­tact poses.</p>
    <p>But most ad­min­is­tra­tors seem to be­lieve that a rule ban­ning sex is un­re­al­is­tic and are qui­etly hop­ing that stu­dents will use com­mon sense and re­frain from, say, hav­ing it with peo­ple out­side their pod.</p>
    <p>“I think at some point, if you treat young peo­ple like adults, they are go­ing to act like adults,” said Dr Gor­don Gee, pres­i­dent of West Vir­ginia Univer­sity.</p>
