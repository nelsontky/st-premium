    <p>Green bonds – debt taken on to fi­nance projects with en­vi­ron­men­tal ben­e­fits – hit a record last month with US$50 bil­lion (S$67.9 bil­lion) is­sued, as more and more com­pa­nies and gov­ern­ments turn to the in­stru­ments.</p>
    <p>Adi­das, French elec­tric­ity firm EDF and telecom­mu­ni­ca­tions firm Orange, along with Ger­many, Egypt and Swe­den, all is­sued green bonds last month, help­ing the vol­ume jump by five times from Au­gust.</p>
    <p>The value of green bonds is­sued so far this year climbed to more than US$176 bil­lion, a 26 per cent in­crease from the same pe­riod last year.</p>
    <p>The to­tal in­cludes in­stru­ments that meet the prin­ci­ples set out by the In­ter­na­tional Cap­i­tal Mar­ket As­so­ci­a­tion (ICMA), the pro­fes­sional as­so­ci­a­tion that unites the global bond mar­ket, and in­for­ma­tion com­piled by Bloomberg.</p>
    <p>The ICMA de­fines green bonds as those which fi­nance re­new­able en­ergy, en­ergy ef­fi­ciency, bio­di­ver­sity, pol­lu­tion re­duc­tion and other sim­i­lar projects.</p>
    <p>But as Euro­pean Cen­tral Bank ex­ec­u­tive board mem­ber Is­abel Schn­abel re­cently pointed out, green bonds re­main a small frac­tion of the over­all debt mar­ket, ac­count­ing for just 5 per cent last year.</p>
    <p>Last month’s boom is due in part to the fact that many oper­a­tions were post­poned ear­lier in the year be­cause of the coro­n­avirus pan­demic. The vol­ume of green bonds is­sued in the first half of this year dipped com­pared with the same pe­riod last year.</p>
    <p>Ms Jovita Razauskait­e, an ex­pert on green bonds at as­set man­ager NN In­vest­ment Part­ners, said: “This month, the vol­ume of cor­po­rate green debt was more im­por­tant than the vol­ume of state green debt.”</p>
    <p>The ar­rival of a ma­jor sov­er­eign emit­ter has en­er­gised the mar­ket, with Ger­many mak­ing its first is­sue. The place­ment of €6.5 bil­lion (S$10.4 bil­lion) last month is to be fol­lowed by an­other of €5 bil­lion be­fore the end of the year.</p>
    <p>“We ex­pect a more diver­si­fied is­suer base,” said Ms Razauskait­e. “In par­tic­u­lar, we ex­pect more in­dus­tri­als to come to the mar­ket while the supra­na­tional space will be en­larged when the EU starts to fi­nance al­most a third of the re­cov­ery fund with green debt.”</p>
    <p>RISK OF ‘GREEN­WASH­ING’</p>
    <p>The sec­tor still has to im­prove the eval­u­a­tion of projects that re­ceive the green la­bel, how­ever.</p>
    <p>Ms Schn­abel noted: “En­vi­ron­men­tal rat­ings for green bonds or other fi­nan­cial in­stru­ments – if avail­able – are of­ten in­con­sis­tent, in­com­pa­ra­ble and, at times, un­re­li­able.”</p>
    <p>The pos­si­bil­ity that green bonds could end up sim­ply be­ing “green­wash­ing” – pro­vid­ing more ben­e­fit to cor­po­rate im­age than the en­vi­ron­ment – has been a per­sis­tent con­cern.</p>
    <p>And the emer­gence of ad­di­tional la­bels that muddy the wa­ters, such as “tran­si­tion bonds”, makes mat­ters worse.</p>
    <p>These are aimed at help­ing industries with high green­house gas emis­sions shift to greener ac­tiv­i­ties, but there are wor­ries that vague rules could al­low the fi­nanc­ing of switch­ing to nat­u­ral gas, which is cleaner than coal but not a re­new­able re­source.</p>
    <p>There are also con­cerns that green bonds, even the best of them, are not lead­ing to much tan­gi­ble im­prove­ment.</p>
    <p>“So far... green bond projects have not nec­es­sar­ily trans­lated into com­par­a­tively low or fall­ing car­bon emis­sions at the firm level,” said a re­cent study by re­searchers at the Bank of In­ter­na­tional Set­tle­ments.</p>
    <p>Other com­pa­nies, such as lux­ury house Chanel, is­sue so-called sus­tain­abil­ity-linked bonds mean­while. The pro­ceeds from these bonds can be used to fi­nance any type of project, but the bor­rower makes pledges to meet cer­tain sus­tain­abil­ity tar­gets and pays a penalty if they fail.</p>
    <p>The flex­i­bil­ity open to is­suers makes these bonds harder to la­bel and com­pare. “There are eval­u­a­tion cri­te­ria, but the in­vestor must make his own se­lec­tion,” Ms Razauskait­e said.</p>
