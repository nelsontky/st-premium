    <p>Stereo­types can be hard to shake off.</p>
    <p>Take Mini, for in­stance. Since the Bri­tish brand was born in 1969, its pint-sized, low-slung cars quickly be­came a dar­ling among driv­ing fans. It would not be long af­ter that some­one com­pared the Mini to a go-kart, and that stuck.</p>
    <p>When BMW bought Mini in 2000, the new cars which emerged were more “midi” than “mini”. Still, to its en­gi­neer­ing credit, BMW man­aged to re­tain the Mini’s go-kart rep­u­ta­tion.</p>
    <p>But when it de­cided to make the Countryman to cash in on the cross­over craze, the go-kart bub­ble burst. Be­cause physics dic­tate you sim­ply can­not make a sport utility ve­hi­cle-like ve­hi­cle han­dle like a go-kart.</p>
    <p>Granted, the Countryman is rel­a­tively “low slung” for its genre, but it is still a size­able ve­hi­cle. Hop­ping straight from the Lexus IS300 (the other car re­viewed here) into the Mini Cooper S Countryman, the first thing I no­tice is how laggy the lat­ter’s steer­ing is and how much body roll it dis­plays.</p>
    <p>So, I have to con­sciously tell my­self that in the au­to­mo­tive world, there are very few ab­so­lutes. Most things are rel­a­tive. And that I should not judge the Countryman too quickly be­cause I had just come from a well-sorted, dy­namic sa­loon.</p>
    <p>Also, to judge the Countryman against its smaller sib­lings would not be kosher ei­ther.</p>
    <p>Af­ter all, the Countryman has as much sim­i­lar­ity to a Mini 2Dr as a house cat has with a Ben­gal tiger.</p>
    <p>But as a ver­sa­tile ve­hi­cle tai­lored for ac­tive fam­i­lies, the Countryman is rather fetch­ing.</p>
    <p>The model here is a facelift, with re­designed grille and head­lights (now LED, as are the tail-lights) and the ad­di­tion of a rear apron which gives rugged look.</p>
    <p>In­side, it gets a dig­i­tal in­stru­ment panel seen in the Mini E. In the elec­tric car, it goes with the min­i­mal­ist slant of the car. But in the lux­u­ri­ously ap­pointed Countryman, it ap­pears a tad rudi­men­tary.</p>
    <p>The in­te­rior is exquisitel­y ap­pointed, with soft tan leather in quilt stitch­ing – like what you might find in a Bent­ley. On the dash and doors, a shaded silver trim adds to the bling.</p>
    <p>An 8.8-inch cir­cu­lar in­fo­tain­ment touch­screen can be paired with your iPhone and comes with a range of con­nected ser­vices. The car is also fit­ted with au­to­matic it a slightly more</p>
    <p>park­ing for par­al­lel lots, which up un­til re­cently was not nec­es­sary for Mi­nis.</p>
    <p>Com­pared with the pre-facelift one, the pow­er­train is less mus­cu­lar. The 2-litre four-cylin­der turbo is mated to a seven-speed du­al­clutch gear­box in­stead of an eight­speed tra­di­tional au­to­matic.</p>
    <p>Max­i­mum power is now 178hp in­stead of 192hp pre­vi­ously, while torque is un­changed at 280Nm. But pos­si­bly be­cause of the new trans­mis­sion, its 0 to 100kmh tim­ing re­mains un­changed at 7.4 sec­onds, although peak ve­loc­ity is 2kmh lower at 223kmh.</p>
    <p>On the go, the car is not as ef­fer­ves­cent as you ex­pect of a Mini, but it is not slug­gish ei­ther. But it def­i­nitely does not feel as quick as its 7.4-sec­ond cen­tury dash sug­gests.</p>
    <p>The new en­gine (op­er­at­ing at a higher pres­sure) and new gear­box were sup­posed to re­sult in a 5 per cent im­prove­ment in fuel ef­fi­ciency to 5.9 litres/100km, as stated in the specs sheet. But in real life, the test-car av­er­ages al­most twice that fig­ure – rather high, even for a ve­hi­cle its size.</p>
    <p>But given its lux­u­ri­ous in­te­rior, you could per­haps pre­tend you were driv­ing a mini Ben­tayga. And for sure, you wouldn’t com­pare the Bent­ley SUV to a go-kart.</p>
