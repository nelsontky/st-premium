    <p>The Sin­ga­pore Med­i­cal Coun­cil (SMC), as the pro­fes­sional watch­dog for med­i­cal pro­fes­sion­als here, has an im­por­tant role to play to en­sure that doc­tors do not abuse their po­si­tions and that pa­tient safety is as­sured.</p>
    <p>But it has one crit­i­cal flaw that has shown up in re­cent times: its tar­di­ness.</p>
    <p>Even the Court of Three Judges – the court of ap­peal against SMC dis­ci­plinary hear­ing judg­ments – has de­plored the slow pace with which the body has dealt with com­plaints against doc­tors, some­times tak­ing as many as five to seven years to do so.</p>
    <p>The court has shown its dis­plea­sure by giv­ing “dis­counted” penal­ties to doc­tors to com­pen­sate for the de­lay.</p>
    <p>Its rea­son­ing is that the long years of de­lay have caused the doc­tor un­due worry and suf­fer­ing, so it’s only fair to re­duce the ac­tual penalty meted out.</p>
    <p>Such de­lays are fair to nei­ther party.</p>
    <p>If the doc­tor is in­no­cent, he is stressed by the cloud hang­ing over his head for years.</p>
    <p>If he is guilty, the pa­tient, and oc­ca­sion­ally the next of kin, has to wait years for jus­tice to be meted out.</p>
    <p>Worse, de­lays could harm pa­tients, as a re­cent dis­ci­plinary tri­bunal find­ing shows.</p>
    <p>But first, a quick ex­pla­na­tion on the process. When a com­plaint is made about a doc­tor, the chair­man of SMC’s com­plaints panel would set up a com­plaints com­mit­tee to look into the case.</p>
    <p>The SMC gets an av­er­age of 165 com­plaints a year, which means 165 such com­mit­tees need to be set up.</p>
    <p>The com­mit­tee de­cides if the com­plaint should be dis­missed, if a warn­ing to the doc­tor is mer­ited, or if it might be suf­fi­ciently se­ri­ous for a dis­ci­plinary hear­ing. The com­mit­tee may con­tact a doc­tor to get his ex­pla­na­tion at this stage.</p>
    <p>If it de­cides on a hear­ing, a dis­ci­plinary tri­bunal is formed and the doc­tor is is­sued a no­tice of in­quiry.</p>
    <p>LONG DE­LAY IN PROCESS</p>
    <p>Ear­lier this month, an SMC tri­bunal found Dr Tan Joong Piang, a gen­eral prac­ti­tioner, guilty of pre­scrib­ing large num­bers of hyp­notics – to­talling be­tween 1,235 and 4,100 tablets – to six pa­tients over long pe­ri­ods ex­ceed­ing a decade.</p>
    <p>The pa­tient who re­ceived the most sleep­ing pills was given 4,100 tablets be­tween Septem­ber 2002 and April 2016.</p>
    <p>Be­cause of the dan­gers posed by such medicines, the Min­istry of Health (MOH) has guide­lines which say pa­tients who have been on hyp­notics for a cu­mu­la­tive pe­riod of eight weeks “must be re­ferred to the ap­pro­pri­ate spe­cial­ist for fur­ther man­age­ment”. This wasn’t done.</p>
    <p>Fur­ther­more, these six pa­tients were el­derly peo­ple, for whom there is greater dan­ger in hav­ing im­proper pre­scrip­tions.</p>
    <p>The old­est was aged 81 when the last lot of pills was pre­scribed.</p>
    <p>It was way back in 2012 when the Min­istry of Health (MOH) dis­cov­ered Dr Tan’s un­ortho­dox pre­scrib­ing pat­terns and sent a let­ter in­form­ing the SMC of this breach of good prac­tice guide­lines: on Feb 29, 2012. That’s eight years ago.</p>
    <p>On Dec 21 that year – 10 months af­ter re­ceiv­ing the let­ter from the min­istry – the SMC lodged a com­plaint to the chair­man of the com­plaints panel.</p>
    <p>One would have thought that send­ing the MOH’s let­ter to the com­plaints panel chair­man to de­cide on any ac­tion should have taken no more than a few days – not 10 months.</p>
    <p>Once a com­plaint is re­ceived, a com­plaints com­mit­tee would be set up to de­cide if the com­plaint was mer­ited and, if so, whether it war­rants a dis­ci­plinary hear­ing, or whether a warn­ing to the doc­tor would suf­fice.</p>
    <p>In this case, a de­ci­sion was made to have a hear­ing.</p>
    <p>It is not known how long the com­mit­tee took to de­cide on a hear­ing and when it got in touch with the doc­tor.</p>
    <p>We know, from the pub­lished grounds of de­ci­sion by the dis­ci­plinary tri­bunal, that Dr Tan pro­vided his writ­ten ex­pla­na­tion on March 26, 2016.</p>
    <p>On re­al­is­ing that the SMC was look­ing into his prac­tice of freely pre­scrib­ing sleep­ing pills to these six pa­tients, Dr Tan stopped do­ing so for these pa­tients in April 2016.</p>
    <p>That is slightly more than four years since the SMC had been alerted to the way the doc­tor was freely pre­scrib­ing sleep­ing pills to these pa­tients.</p>
    <p>It then took another 15 months from the time the doc­tor gave his ex­pla­na­tion, for him to be in­formed of a for­mal in­quiry against him. That was on June 9, 2017.</p>
    <p>It took al­most two years more be­fore the doc­tor was told of the charges against him, as the no­tice of in­quiry was dated Feb 20 last year.</p>
    <p>Such slow ac­tion is not only de­plorable, but in this par­tic­u­lar case, posed a risk to the six pa­tients in­volved as Dr Tan con­tin­ued to freely pre­scribe the hyp­notics, with the last such pre­scrip­tion made on April 27, 2016.</p>
    <p>This was de­spite MOH alert­ing the SMC in 2012.</p>
    <p>In these four years, there may have been other pa­tients get­ting sim­i­lar lib­eral pre­scrip­tions of sleep­ing pills who are not listed in the charges against Dr Tan.</p>
    <p>The dis­ci­plinary hear­ing even­tu­ally com­menced on July 3 last year and was con­cluded on May 28. The doc­tor is usu­ally given a month to de­cide whether to ap­peal against the judg­ment be­fore the sen­tence is car­ried out.</p>
    <p>He was sus­pended for 22 months. The penalty deemed ap­pro­pri­ate was ac­tu­ally higher – 33 months – but the doc­tor was given a third off for the de­lay be­tween June 2017, when he was is­sued the no­tice of in­quiry, and the ac­tual hear­ing. Im­plied in the dis­count is the stress on the doc­tor dur­ing the de­lay.</p>
    <p>No mat­ter how many months of sus­pen­sion was given, the sen­tence shows that the dis­ci­plinary tri­bunal felt that Dr Tan’s ac­tion was suf­fi­ciently egre­gious to merit a sus­pen­sion.</p>
    <p>The doc­tor had breached guide­lines spelt out by the MOH on the pre­scrip­tion of such hyp­notics, since they could pose a risk of de­pen­dency or ad­dic­tion, and in some cases, ac­tual harm.</p>
    <p>The tri­bunal said the doc­tor “had rid­den com­plete roughshod over the re­quire­ment to de­fer to the views of a spe­cial­ist be­fore con­tin­u­ing the pre­scrip­tion of hyp­notics af­ter the pas­sage of eight weeks”.</p>
    <p>On top of that, it added: “These fla­grant de­par­tures from the guide­lines were fur­ther ex­ac­er­bated by the fact that the six pa­tients were all ad­vanced in years and would be con­sid­ered a vul­ner­a­ble class of pa­tients.”</p>
    <p>The MOH guide­lines note: “The el­derly are es­pe­cially vul­ner­a­ble to the ad­verse ef­fects of hyp­notic drugs.”</p>
    <p>These in­clude de­pres­sion, con­fu­sion and lack of co­or­di­na­tion and mo­tor skills that could lead to falls and frac­tures. They could also suf­fer from sleep ap­noea and other sleep dis­or­ders.</p>
    <p>Yes, the doc­tor was ob­vi­ously at fault. In fact, the tri­bunal said “he stood to profit by ‘clos­ing one eye’ in the way he pre­scribed hyp­notics”.</p>
    <p>But in this case, the SMC is not with­out blame ei­ther. If it had acted faster, it could have stopped the doc­tor from freely dis­pens­ing the sleep­ing pills to these pa­tients eight years ago, when first told of the prac­tice by the MOH.</p>
    <p>It was for­tu­nate that none of the pa­tients ap­pears to have been gravely harmed by the con­tin­ued long-term use of the drugs.</p>
    <p>If they had been, how much blame lies with the doc­tor, and how much with the SMC for al­low­ing him to con­tinue his im­proper pre­scrip­tions for so long?</p>
    <p>The SMC should look through its out­stand­ing cases to see if there are oth­ers where a speedy res­o­lu­tion is called for – and to tackle them im­me­di­ately.</p>
    <p>There are some com­plaints where de­lay does not cause se­ri­ous harm, and oth­ers where the po­ten­tial for harm ex­ists.</p>
    <p>PO­TEN­TIAL FOR HARM</p>
    <p>Take another re­cent case: the com­plaint against two doc­tors for us­ing their priv­i­leged po­si­tions to take ad­van­tage of fe­male pa­tients and groom some of them for sex.</p>
    <p>The com­plaint was made on June 19, 2018.</p>
    <p>It was al­most ex­actly two years later, on June 18 this year, that the SMC de­cided “it was nec­es­sary for the pro­tec­tion of mem­bers of the pub­lic and in the pub­lic in­ter­est” for ac­tion to be taken.</p>
    <p>It is­sued an in­terim or­der, pend­ing a judg­ment from a dis­ci­plinary hear­ing, for Dr Ju­lian Ong Kian Peng and Dr Chan Herng Nieng not to con­tact fe­male pa­tients out­side of the scope of their med­i­cal prac­tice.</p>
    <p>Again, if the two doc­tors are found in­no­cent, then the de­lay in ac­tion by the SMC is not ma­jor.</p>
    <p>But if the com­plaint is proven cor­rect and the two doc­tors – a sur­geon and a psy­chi­a­trist – had con­tin­ued with the prac­tice that is the cause of the com­plaint, then other vul­ner­a­ble pa­tients would have suf­fered – be­cause of the de­lay in the SMC’s in­terim ac­tion.</p>
    <p>In deal­ing with com­plaints against doc­tors, the SMC needs to abide by the adage that “jus­tice must be swift, sure and seen to be done, or it is not done at all”, in the oft-quoted words of for­mer Bri­tish crim­i­nal jus­tice min­is­ter Nick Herbert.</p>
    <p>The SMC re­ceives about 165 com­plaints a year. Not all the com­plaints are war­ranted. Some are mer­ited, but not ur­gent.</p>
    <p>What the SMC needs to do is to have a quick first cut of the com­plaints it re­ceives – in­clud­ing those from the MOH – and de­cide if ur­gent ac­tion may be needed for any of them.</p>
    <p>These, in the in­ter­est of pro­tect­ing pa­tients, should be fast-tracked.</p>
    <p>If that is not pos­si­ble, then in­terim or­ders, such as the one against the two doc­tors ac­cused of groom­ing pa­tients for sex, should be made.</p>
