    <p>LON­DON • The j ersey worn by Diego Maradona when he scored his in­fa­mous “Hand Of God” goal against Eng­land at the 1986 World Cup in Mexico could be avail­able for US$2 mil­lion (S$2.68 mil­lion) fol­low­ing the Ar­gen­tinian’s death on Wed­nes­day, says an Amer­i­can sports mem­o­ra­bilia ex­pert.</p>
    <p>The shirt is owned by for­mer Eng­land player Steve Hodge, who got it from Maradona after the match, in which his at­tempted back pass led to the con­tro­ver­sial goal that helped dump Eng­land out of the tour­na­ment which Ar­gentina went on to win.</p>
    <p>“I was walk­ing down the tun­nel and Maradona was com­ing in the op­po­site di­rec­tion. I just tugged my shirt and we swopped there and then,” the for­mer mid­fielder told the Bri­tish me­dia.</p>
    <p>The shirt is cur­rently on dis­play at Eng­land’s Na­tional Foot­ball Mu­seum in Manch­ester.</p>
    <p>“It’s very dif­fi­cult to gauge (the value) with the “Hand Of God” jersey, but I know that the owner was look­ing for a US$2 mil­lion pri­vate sale,” David Amer­man of Goldin Auc­tion in New Jersey told Reuters.</p>
    <p>His firm is cur­rently in­volved in an­other auc­tion to­gether with Sotheby’s called “A Cen­tury Of Cham­pi­ons”, which fea­tures a Jules Rimet tro­phy which was pre­sented to Pele by Fifa after he won his third World Cup with Brazil in 1970.</p>
    <p>The tro­phy is ex­pected to sell for up to US$800,000 and that sum could be dwarfed if Hodge finds a buyer for the Maradona shirt or if he puts it up for auc­tion, al­though the 58-year-old may not quite reach his tar­get price.</p>
    <p>“It’s very dif­fi­cult to see how it would get to the US$2 mil­lion price, but I don’t see why an in­di­vid­ual who had the money wouldn’t want some­thing like that. If you find the right per­son in the right place, it’s a re­al­is­tic pos­si­bil­ity,” Amer­man ex­plained.</p>
    <p>“Maradona’s rookie soc­cer card, we re­cently sold a copy for US$10,000, and that was be­fore his death. I saw one yes­ter­day on­line ask­ing for US$20,000.”</p>
    <p>But Amer­man sounded a note of cau­tion for those think­ing of get­ting in­volved in the Maradona mem­o­ra­bilia mar­ket.</p>
    <p>“Right now we’re def­i­nitely see­ing in­creased ac­tion – I’ve al­ready got in­quiries from peo­ple who have pur­chased Maradona items on our site look­ing to sell them back in our next auc­tion,” he said.</p>
    <p>“We saw with the pass­ing of Kobe Bryant this year... an im­me­di­ate huge spike in his mem­o­ra­bilia, then it lev­els out be­cause the mar­ket gets sat­u­rated.”</p>

He had ear&#xAD;lier cheated in scor&#xAD;ing the &#x201C;Hand of God&#x201D; goal. The team even&#xAD;tu&#xAD;ally won their sec&#xAD;ond ti&#xAD;tle.</p>
