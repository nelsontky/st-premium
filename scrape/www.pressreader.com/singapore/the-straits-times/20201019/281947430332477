    <p>Madam Has­nah Mo­hamed Maideen, 57, can­not es­cape the stress and burnout that come with be­ing the main care­giver for her el­der sis­ter Fa­timah Mo­hamed Ja­maludin.</p>
    <p>Madam Fa­timah, 73, was di­ag­nosed with de­men­tia in 2012 and her con­di­tion has grad­u­ally be­come more se­vere.</p>
    <p>She now needs help with daily ac­tiv­i­ties such as eat­ing, bathing, dress­ing and go­ing to the toi­let. She also has sev­eral health con­di­tions – di­a­betes, high blood pres­sure, high choles­terol and asthma.</p>
    <p>Madam Has­nah quit her job as a food stall helper in 2013 to care for her sis­ter.</p>
    <p>She said: “Oc­ca­sion­ally, Fa­timah has dif­fi­culty sleep­ing at night and will dis­turb me. She will ask me for food al­though she has eaten. Some­times, she will just walk around the house, which is a risk for her as she’s prone to fall­ing.”</p>
    <p>Once, Madam Fa­timah had stom­ach flu but did not tell her sis­ter that she was not feel­ing well. Next thing Madam Has­nah knew, there were fae­ces all over the floor of their home.</p>
    <p>Both their hus­bands died more than 20 years ago, and the two sis­ters live to­gether in a one-room ren­tal flat in Pasir Ris.</p>
    <p>De­spite the dif­fi­cul­ties she faces, Madam Has­nah said she does not feel she is all alone. The doc­tors at the poly­clinic and hos­pi­tals of­ten give her ad­vice on how to man­age her sis­ter’s con­di­tion, and her neigh­bours have been sup­port­ive, she said.</p>
    <p>One of Madam Has­nah’s three chil­dren also lives nearby with his fam­ily. And she and her sis­ter re­ceive fi­nan­cial sup­port from a mosque and the So­cial Ser­vice Of­fice.</p>
    <p>In March last year, so­cial work­ers from the Club Heal com­mu­nity en­gage­ment team paid them a visit, and Madam Has­nah de­cided to sign up with them for more care­giv­ing sup­port.</p>
    <p>Club Heal pro­vides psy­cho-ed­u­ca­tion and sup­port­ive coun­selling to peo­ple with men­tal health is­sues and their fam­i­lies.</p>
    <p>A team from the char­ity now vis­its Madam Has­nah once a month to see how she is do­ing and gives her in­for­ma­tion about ac­tiv­i­ties and re­sources that could be use­ful for her. It is also an op­por­tu­nity for Madam Has­nah to talk about her wor­ries and prob­lems.</p>
    <p>She said: “If I need to vent, it is an out­let for me, and it helps me re­lease some stress.”</p>
