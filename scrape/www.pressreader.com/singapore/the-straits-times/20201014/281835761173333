    <p>Bri­tain’s Par­lia­ment has ap­proved Prime Min­is­ter Boris John­son’s emer­gency plan to con­tain an alarm­ing rise in new coro­n­avirus in­fec­tions by di­vid­ing the coun­try into three risk tiers, and ap­ply dif­fer­ent hy­giene mea­sures de­pend­ing on the level of Covid-19 preva­lence.</p>
    <p>Only those liv­ing in the very high risk tier 3 ar­eas where there is a large num­ber of virus car­ri­ers will be sub­jected to a to­tal lock­down, in­clud­ing a ban on all pub­lic meet­ings, com­mer­cial and so­cial ac­tiv­i­ties; Bri­tons re­sid­ing in tiers 1 and 2 – clas­si­fied as medium or high-risk ar­eas, re­spec­tively – will be al­lowed more free­dom to go about their daily lives.</p>
    <p>The new sys­tem is de­signed to sim­plify and har­monise the ex­ist­ing and of­ten con­fus­ing patch­work of health reg­u­la­tions and dampen in­fec­tion rates while still avoid­ing a re­peat of the com­plete na­tional shut­down first ap­plied in March, which had cat­a­strophic ef­fects on the na­tion’s econ­omy.</p>
    <p>“This is not how we want to live our lives, but this is the nar­row path we have to tread be­tween the so­cial and eco­nomic trauma of a full lock­down and the mas­sive human, and in­deed eco­nomic cost of an un­con­tained epi­demic,” Mr John­son told MPs.</p>
    <p>But an ini­tia­tive de­signed to re­assert the Prime Min­is­ter’s lead­er­ship in man­ag­ing the health cri­sis was swiftly un­der­mined by the re­lease of pre­vi­ously-clas­si­fied doc­u­ments show­ing that his gov­ern­ment’s own ad­vis­ers had warned as far back as three weeks ago that more dra­co­nian mea­sures would be re­quired to act as a “cir­cuit-breaker” on the fur­ther con­ta­gion.</p>
    <p>And the John­son gov­ern­ment was also crit­i­cised by lo­cal lead­ers in var­i­ous parts of Eng­land, who re­sent the curbs placed on them by ad­min­is­tra­tors in Lon­don.</p>
    <p>Af­ter a lull dur­ing the sum­mer months, the num­ber of new coro­n­avirus in­fec­tions in Bri­tain started ris­ing in early Septem­ber, and now runs at around 15,000 daily, the high­est since the pan­demic started early this year.</p>
    <p>By all ac­counts, most of the newly in­fected are young, there­fore re­quir­ing no hos­pi­tal­i­sa­tion and of­ten ex­hibit­ing no symp­toms. It is no­tice­able, for in­stance, that the fo­cal points for the cur­rent pan­demic are the north­ern English cities of Liver­pool and Not­ting­ham, both big univer­sity cen­tres where stu­dents have just started a new aca­demic year.</p>
    <p>So, at least for now, mor­tal­ity rates are low: Around 70 peo­ple are recorded as dy­ing on av­er­age ev­ery day as a re­sult of Covid-re­lated com­pli­ca­tions, a far cry from the av­er­age of 1,000 daily deaths in the ear­lier days of the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Still, the fear is that what has started with the young may spill over to the rest of the pop­u­la­tion.</p>
    <p>And hospi­tal ad­mis­sions for acutely ill pa­tients are al­ready ris­ing fast.</p>
    <p>Emer­gency hos­pi­tals con­structed by the mil­i­tary ear­lier this year but sub­se­quently de­ac­ti­vated for lack of de­mand have yet again been or­dered to go on a high state of alert.</p>
    <p>With some parts of the coun­try affected more than oth­ers, the in­tro­duc­tion of a new sys­tem which treats bits of Bri­tain dif­fer­ently on the ba­sis of risk as­sess­ments is viewed as more ef­fec­tive than the com­plete na­tional shut­down ap­plied be­fore.</p>
    <p>But it is also con­tro­ver­sial. The city of Liver­pool is the only part of</p>
    <p>the UK which cur­rently falls un­der the tier 3 high­est-risk des­ig­na­tion. No­body, though, can ex­plain why Not­ting­ham, which has a higher in­fec­tion rate than Liver­pool, is clas­si­fied as only a tier 2 risk city.</p>
    <p>Mr John­son, who faced hos­tile ques­tions from more than 100 Mem­bers of Par­lia­ment yesterday, of­fered no plau­si­ble def­i­ni­tion for the sup­posed dis­tinc­tion be­tween “high” and “very high” risk ar­eas. And the ex­pec­ta­tion is that crit­i­cism of the tiered sys­tem will only get worse as parts of the coun­try move ei­ther up or down the risk ta­ble.</p>
    <p>But the big­gest prob­lem with the new sys­tem is that no­body knows</p>
    <p>what the im­pact of the pro­posed re­stric­tions will be. Clos­ing bars and restau­rants and im­pos­ing early evening cur­fews could en­cour­age peo­ple to con­gre­gate in their own or their friends’ homes, for in­stance, and al­though this would be il­le­gal, it is also near to im­pos­si­ble to po­lice.</p>
    <p>Pro­fes­sor Christo­pher Whitty, Eng­land’s chief med­i­cal of­fi­cer, has al­ready ad­mit­ted that he was not con­fi­dent the mea­sures “would be enough to get on top of” the virus, hint­ing that the lo­cal author­i­ties in “very high” alert ar­eas would have to go fur­ther.</p>
