    <p>Some lym­phoma pa­tients suf­fer­ing from an ag­gres­sive form of blood can­cer have shown pos­i­tive re­sponse to a cer­tain type of im­munother­apy, ac­cord­ing to re­searchers from the Na­tional Can­cer Cen­tre Sin­ga­pore (NCCS).</p>
    <p>Im­munother­apy is a type of can­cer treat­ment that ac­ti­vates the im­mune sys­tem to fight the dis­ease.</p>
    <p>The re­searchers from NCCS found that pa­tients with Nat­u­ralKiller T-Cell Lym­phoma (NKTCL), a rare but ag­gres­sive type of blood can­cer, re­sponded well to anti PD-1 im­munother­apy if they had a mu­ta­tion in their PD-L1 gene.</p>
    <p>Their find­ings were pub­lished in med­i­cal jour­nal Leukemia on Aug 5.</p>
    <p>The PD-1 and PD-L1 genes are known as check­point pro­teins on the cells’ sur­face and to­gether form the im­mune check­point.</p>
    <p>Th­ese pro­teins help reg­u­late the im­mune sys­tem dur­ing in­fec­tions, pre­vent­ing over-ac­ti­va­tion of the sys­tem, which could cause host tis­sue dam­age.</p>
    <p>How­ever, in the case of NKTCL pa­tients, the PD-L1 gene on the tu­mour cells binds with the PD-1 gene on the T-cells, pre­vent­ing the Tcells from at­tack­ing the tu­mour cells.</p>
    <p>The anti PD-1 ther­apy, which is an im­mune check­point in­hibitor, works by block­ing the two pro­teins to stop them from bind­ing, thus ac­ti­vat­ing the T-cells to launch an at­tack on the tu­mour.</p>
    <p>Pem­brolizumab is an anti PD-1 mon­o­clonal an­ti­body which blocks the PD-1 gene, dis­rupts the im­mune check­point and ac­ti­vates the Tcells.</p>
    <p>This an­ti­body, which has re­cently been used for lung can­cer treat­ment, was utilised in the NCCS study. Sub­se­quently, seven out of 19 NKTCL pa­tients saw com­plete re­cov­ery.</p>
    <p>In the study, lo­cal re­searchers col­lab­o­rated with re­searchers from China, Hong Kong and South Korea to study re­lapsed pa­tients who were treated with pem­brolizumab.</p>
    <p>Four of th­ese re­cov­ered pa­tients had a mu­ta­tion in their PD-L1 gene, which the re­searchers be­lieve is the rea­son for their treat­ment’s ef­fi­cacy. All sur­viv­ing pa­tients have been alive for more than two years af­ter they re­ceived the treat­ment.</p>
    <p>Dr Ong Choon Kiat, prin­ci­pal in­ves­ti­ga­tor of the di­vi­sion of cel­lu­lar and molec­u­lar re­search at NCCS’ Lym­phoma Ge­nomic Trans­la­tional Lab­o­ra­tory, said: “The study of how NKTCL pa­tients re­spond to im­munother­apy has been lim­ited to date. We are pleased that our study has iden­ti­fied ro­bust biomark­ers that re­li­ably im­prove treat­ment se­lec­tion for pa­tients who will have a high like­li­hood of re­spond­ing pos­i­tively.”</p>
    <p>The team filed a patent for the tech­nol­ogy in 2017 and a di­ag­nos­tic test was de­vel­oped by lo­cal biotech com­pany Lu­cence Di­ag­nos­tics to de­ter­mine which pa­tients will be able to ben­e­fit from the treat­ment.</p>
    <p>In the test, DNA from the tu­mour sam­ple is ex­tracted to de­tect the pres­ence of mu­ta­tion in the PD-L1 gene.</p>
    <p>All pa­tients who have re­lapsed or are no longer re­spond­ing to chemo­ther­apy or ra­dio­ther­apy will be of­fered the di­ag­nos­tic test to see if they will ben­e­fit from pem­brolizumab.</p>
    <p>The drug is ad­min­is­tered through an in­tra­venous in­jec­tion every three weeks and the treat­ment con­tin­ues as long as the pa­tient is ben­e­fit­ing from it.</p>
    <p>Cur­rent stud­ies are look­ing into the op­ti­mal du­ra­tion of ther­apy, which has not yet been de­ter­mined with cer­tainty.</p>
    <p>Pro­fes­sor Lim Soon Thye, deputy med­i­cal di­rec­tor (clin­i­cal) of NCCS and a prin­ci­pal in­ves­ti­ga­tor of the study, said: “Guid­ing the choice of ther­apy is crit­i­cal for can­cer pa­tients, where treat­ment must be timely and drugs can be costly.</p>
    <p>“It is not easy to bridge the gap from bench to bed­side, so it is par­tic­u­larly grat­i­fy­ing to be able to trans­late our find­ings into clin­i­cal ap­pli­ca­tions that will di­rectly ben­e­fit pa­tients and health­care sys­tems.”</p>
