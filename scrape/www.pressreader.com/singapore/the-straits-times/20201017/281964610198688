    <p>Mr Chia Mia Chi­ang is step­ping down as pres­i­dent of the Nanyang Academy of Fine Arts (Nafa) on Dec 31.</p>
    <p>Tak­ing over as pres­i­dent-des­ig­nate on Dec 21 is Mrs Tan-Soh Wai Lan, 53, cur­rently co­or­di­nat­ing di­vi­sional di­rec­tor of the Com­mu­ni­ca­tions and En­gage­ment Group at the Min­istry of Ed­u­ca­tion. From 2012 to 2016, she was prin­ci­pal of CHIJ St Ni­cholas Girls’ School, where she co­or­di­nated and im­ple­mented its Joint In­te­grated Pro­gramme with Catholic High School and Sin­ga­pore Chi­nese Girls’ School.</p>
    <p>Mr Chia, 68, is cred­ited with lead­ing Nafa’s strate­gic re­view when he joined the in­sti­tu­tion in 2014 af­ter more than a decade as the prin­ci­pal of Ngee Ann Polytech­nic.</p>
    <p>Un­der him, the 82-year-old academy strength­ened its pro­gramme with an in­dus­try-based learn­ing cur­ricu­lum that in­cluded a manda­tory se­mes­ter-long in­tern­ship, in­tro­duced its Over­seas Im­mer­sion Pro­gramme and en­cour­aged in­ter­dis­ci­pli­nary projects across the academy.</p>
    <p>Mr Chia said in a state­ment yes­ter­day: “It has been an im­mense priv­i­lege to be in­volved in Nafa’s growth and trans­for­ma­tion. I am ap­pre­cia­tive of the sup­port which the academy has given me, and I am proud of the re­sults that we have achieved in unity. I am glad to be pass­ing the baton to Wai Lan, whose dy­namism will serve Nafa well in its next phase of growth.”</p>
    <p>Among his achieve­ments is se­cur­ing $10 mil­lion from the Ngee Ann Kongsi in 2015 for Nafa’s new campus build­ing, the largest donation since the academy’s found­ing. And in 2016, Kwan Im Thong Hood Cho Tem­ple do­nated $5 mil­lion to the build­ing.</p>
    <p>Nafa’s board chair­man, Ms Low Sin Leng, said: “The academy is deeply grate­ful to Mia Chi­ang for his vi­sion and wis­dom. Notably, he has been a pil­lar of strength as he steered the academy smoothly in this chal­leng­ing year.”</p>
