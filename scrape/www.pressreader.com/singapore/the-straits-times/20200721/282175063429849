    <p>The coro­n­avirus pan­demic has sig­nif­i­cantly ac­cel­er­ated dig­i­tal trans­for­ma­tion in com­pa­nies, a study noted to­day.</p>
    <p>It found that around 70 per cent of those polled here and across the world be­lieve that the cri­sis stem­ming from Covid-19 has forced their busi­ness to move much quicker in adopt­ing on­line tools. The poll by Twilio, a cloud com­mu­ni­ca­tions plat­form, also noted that re­spon­dents ex­pect dig­i­tal com­mu­ni­ca­tion strate­gies to be sped up by an av­er­age of six years as a re­sult of the dif­fi­cul­ties brought on by the cri­sis.</p>
    <p>Twilio chief cus­tomer of­fi­cer Glenn We­in­stein said: “Over the last few months, we’ve seen years-long dig­i­tal trans­for­ma­tion road maps com­pressed into days and weeks in or­der to adapt to the new nor­mal as a re­sult of Covid-19.</p>
    <p>“Our cus­tomers in nearly every in­dus­try have had to iden­tify new ways to com­mu­ni­cate with their cus­tomers and stake­hold­ers – from pa­tients to stu­dents to shop­pers and even em­ploy­ees – es­sen­tially overnight.”</p>
    <p>The study polled 2,569 re­spon­dents from coun­tries such as Aus­tralia, France, Ger­many, Italy, Ja­pan, Spain and Bri­tain, in­clud­ing 270 here. Half of the re­spon­dents were di­rec­tors and the rest vice-pres­i­dents and ex­ec­u­tives.</p>
    <p>Most of the par­tic­i­pants agreed that en­abling dig­i­tal com­mu­ni­ca­tion has been crit­i­cal in ad­dress­ing busi­ness chal­lenges dur­ing the cri­sis. Al­most all com­pa­nies polled are also seek­ing new ways of en­gag­ing their cus­tomers and stake­hold­ers as a re­sult.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, more than 30 per cent felt bar­ri­ers to trans­for­ma­tion – the need to seek ex­ec­u­tive ap­proval, the lack of a clear strat­egy, re­luc­tance to re­place legacy soft­ware, in­suf­fi­cient bud­gets or a lack of time – have been bro­ken down amid the pan­demic as firms move fast to shore up their op­er­a­tions.</p>
    <p>Around 80 per cent said the cri­sis has even stim­u­lated an in­crease in dig­i­tal trans­for­ma­tion bud­gets in their com­pa­nies, while around 90 per cent added that their or­gan­i­sa­tions are likely to ex­pand on­line com­mu­ni­ca­tion chan­nels as the world re­opens. One in three com­pa­nies started us­ing live chat and in­ter­ac­tive voice re­sponse chan­nels for the first time as a re­sult of the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Live chat func­tions, e-mails and videos were also in­creas­ingly used as com­mu­ni­ca­tion chan­nels.</p>
    <p>When bro­ken down by sec­tors, tech­nol­ogy, en­ergy and health­care com­pa­nies said they were most likely to speed up dig­i­tal trans­for­ma­tion. Con­struc­tion and en­ergy com­pa­nies saw the great­est ac­cel­er­a­tion in their dig­i­tal com­mu­ni­ca­tion strat­egy specif­i­cally, while tech­nol­ogy firms said they were very likely to ex­pand in this area as the world re­opens.</p>
    <p>The en­ergy, con­struc­tion and fi­nance in­dus­tries added the most new dig­i­tal chan­nels dur­ing the pan­demic, such as live chat and video func­tions.</p>
    <p>Mr We­in­stein said: “Cloud scale, speed and agility are en­abling or­gan­i­sa­tions to in­no­vate faster than ever.</p>
    <p>“We be­lieve the so­lu­tions be­ing built to­day will be the stan­dard for dig­i­tal en­gage­ment in the fu­ture.”</p>
