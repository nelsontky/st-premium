    <p>PORT­LAND • Po­lice in Port­land de­clared a riot late on Monday and made mul­ti­ple ar­rests of pro­test­ers, or­der­ing them to dis­perse af­ter fires were lit at the of­fices of the po­lice as­so­ci­a­tion.</p>
    <p>“Fail­ure to leave now will sub­ject you to ar­rest and/or the use of crowd con­trol mu­ni­tions in­clud­ing but not limited to tear gas and im­pact weapons,” Port­land po­lice said on Twit­ter, adding that per­son­nel were re­spond­ing to the fire near the city’s North Lom­bard Street and North Camp­bell Av­enue area.</p>
    <p>The po­lice later said of­fi­cers had to move in again to ad­dress other fires set by demon­stra­tors and made many ar­rests in the af­ter­math.</p>
    <p>The po­lice used tear gas on pro­test­ers and made 23 ar­rests late on Sun­day as well, say­ing a group of more than 200 demon­stra­tors had lit fires and at­tacked of­fi­cers with lasers, rocks and bot­tles in the city’s North Precinct.</p>
    <p>Demon­stra­tions against racism and po­lice bru­tal­ity have swept the United States since the death in May of Mr Ge­orge Floyd, a 46-yearold black man who died af­ter a Min­neapo­lis po­lice of­fi­cer knelt on his neck for nearly nine min­utes.</p>
    <p>Port­land po­lice said last week that they had de­clared riots 17 times between May 29 and Aug 19.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, ar­son­ists set build­ings ablaze and torched much of the black busi­ness district in a sec­ond night of un­rest in the city of Kenosha, in Wis­con­sin, which was trig­gered by the wound­ing of a black man who was shot in the back by of­fi­cers as his three young sons looked on.</p>
    <p>Smoke bil­lowed over cen­tral Kenosha af­ter po­lice in riot gear clashed with pro­test­ers who de­fied a dusk-to-dawn cur­few on Monday night and into yes­ter­day morn­ing, blocks away from where po­lice shot Mr Ja­cob Blake on Sun­day.</p>
    <p>Mr Blake, 29, sur­vived the shoot­ing, which was cap­tured on video, and was in sta­ble con­di­tion fol­low­ing surgery, his fa­ther said.</p>
    <p>But the in­ci­dent, the lat­est in a litany of cases to fo­cus at­ten­tion on po­lice treat­ment of African Amer­i­cans, un­leashed out­rage in the lake­front city of Kenosha, about 65km south of Mil­wau­kee.</p>
