    <p>LON­DON • Re­tail ty­coon Mike Ash­ley’s Frasers Group is in last-ditch talks to buy the ail­ing Deben­hams de­part­ment store, in a move which could save thou­sands of jobs.</p>
    <p>The owner of the Sports Di­rect brand con­firmed that his com­pany was in ne­go­ti­a­tions in an e-mailed state­ment, say­ing “we hope to be able to save as many jobs as pos­si­ble” at Deben­hams, which is one of Bri­tain’s most iconic re­tail brands.</p>
    <p>News of Mr Ash­ley’s in­ter­est comes just a few days af­ter Deben­hams said it could have to liq­ui­date the business af­ter talks with JD Sports Fash­ion ended.</p>
    <p>The re­tailer has been strug­gling for many years, weighed down by costly stores with hefty rents and large prop­erty taxes.</p>
    <p>The fail­ure of Deben­hams, which em­ploys 12,000 peo­ple, capped a ter­ri­ble week for Bri­tish re­tail af­ter Sir Philip Green’s Ar­ca­dia Group, the owner of the Top­shop and Dorothy Perkins brands, filed for in­sol­vency.</p>
    <p>Deben­hams has 124 stores, all rented, and if a deal is com­pleted, Frasers could op­er­ate them on a 12-month li­cence while de­ter­min­ing how many stores could be saved, said a source who de­clined to be named.</p>
    <p>The source said any deal with Frasers would have to be bet­ter than the liq­ui­da­tion value of Deben­hams, and ne­go­ti­a­tions with FRP Ad­vi­sory, the ad­min­is­tra­tor that has been in con­trol of the de­part­ment store since April, were likely to cen­tre on a value of about £280 mil­lion (S$497 mil­lion).</p>
    <p>Deben­hams de­clined to com­ment on the talks with Frasers Group.</p>
    <p>If Mr Ash­ley suc­ceeds in his ne­go­ti­a­tions, it will be the cul­mi­na­tion of a long and trou­bled in­volve­ment with Deben­hams.</p>
    <p>Once its big­gest share­holder, he had his stake wiped out when lenders took con­trol of the chain last year.</p>
    <p>Mr Ash­ley is es­ti­mated to have lost about £150 mil­lion.</p>
    <p>Frasers Group held talks ear­lier this year with the ad­min­is­tra­tor of Deben­hams, but claimed then that it had been frozen out of the process and was not re­ceiv­ing enough in­for­ma­tion.</p>
    <p>Frasers al­ready owns the House of Fraser chain, an­other de­part­ment store, which it had also bought out of ad­min­is­tra­tion, pro­vid­ing po­ten­tial syn­er­gies if Mr Ash­ley were to merge the two.</p>
    <p>No agree­ment is cer­tain, how­ever. The rea­son JD Sports pulled out of a deal to buy Deben­hams was the fail­ure of Ar­ca­dia, which is one of the big­gest con­ces­sion part­ners of Deben­hams.</p>
    <p>Al­though Deben­hams has used the pan­demic and the cur­rent re­tail cri­sis to rene­go­ti­ate its rents on more favourable terms, it still has a heavy bill for business rates, a form of Bri­tish prop­erty tax.</p>
    <p>“We have found that Deben­hams has been overly re­liant on Ar­ca­dia for many years,” said Frasers fi­nan­cial di­rec­tor Chris Woot­ton in an e-mailed state­ment.</p>
    <p>“As well as no end in sight to the out­dated business rates regime which un­duly pun­ishes the likes of Deben­hams, it may be a bridge too far for the Frasers Group.”</p>
