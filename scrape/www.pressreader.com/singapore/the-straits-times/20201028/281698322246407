    <p>Malaysian Prime Min­is­ter Muhyid­din Yassin was thrown a life­line in the early hours of yes­ter­day when lead­ers from Umno de­clared that it would con­tinue to back his Perikatan Na­sional (PN) gov­ern­ment.</p>
    <p>But Umno sources noted that the sup­port is con­di­tional on con­ces­sions that the Pre­mier may be un­likely to meet, un­der­scor­ing the grow­ing view that Tan Sri Muhyid­din’s grip on power is weak­en­ing.</p>
    <p>Mr Ibrahim Suf­fian, head of in­de­pen­dent polling firm Merdeka Cen­ter, said: “Muhyid­din has won some breath­ing space but the prospects are still un­cer­tain, es­pe­cially with the grow­ing clar­ity that not all of Umno is with him.”</p>
    <p>Mr Muhyid­din is not the only one with his po­lit­i­cal fu­ture on the line.</p>
    <p>Op­po­si­tion leader An­war Ibrahim has also suf­fered a se­ri­ous set­back af­ter he lost the sup­port of his Umno al­lies, who had ear­lier pledged sup­port for his bid to form a new gov­ern­ment. Sev­eral of Datuk Seri An­war’s clos­est sup­port­ers be­lieve he was strung along by Umno pres­i­dent Ah­mad Zahid Hamidi, who used the op­po­si­tion leader to gain po­lit­i­cal lever­age over Mr Muhyid­din.</p>
    <p>“When it mat­tered the most, Zahid played An­war out,” noted a close as­so­ciate of Mr An­war shortly af­ter the Umno state­ment</p>
    <p>Be­hind the scenes, po­lit­i­cal lieu­tenants of Datuk Seri An­war Ibrahim and for­mer pre­mier Na­jib Razak were also work­ing fu­ri­ously to col­lect statu­tory dec­la­ra­tions from Umno MPs pledg­ing sup­port for the op­po­si­tion leader, ac­cord­ing to Umno politi­cians close to Umno pres­i­dent Ah­mad Zahid Hamidi and Na­jib. One Umno politi­cian noted that by late Mon­day, both sides had col­lected pledges of sup­port from more than 20 Umno law­mak­ers. But Zahid, who is fac­ing 47 charges of cor­rup­tion and money laun­der­ing, was be­gin­ning to wa­ver in his back­ing for Mr An­war. Af­ter the Umno Supreme Coun­cil, the party’s chief pol­i­cy­mak­ing body, held a meet­ing on Mon­day night – which lasted more than four hours and was chaired by Zahid – the party de­cided to con­tinue back­ing Mr Muhyid­din. The de­ci­sion sent shock waves to both the An­war and Na­jib camps.</p>
    <p>pledg­ing sup­port to Mr Muhyid­din was re­leased early yes­ter­day morn­ing.</p>
    <p>The fol­low­ing ac­count, pieced to­gether from more than a dozen in­ter­views with gov­ern­ment and op­po­si­tion politi­cians, spot­lights the deeply unset­tled state of Malaysia’s volatile pol­i­tics. The grow­ing po­lit­i­cal paral­y­sis is only rais­ing the wor­ry­ing risk pro­file of a coun­try bat­tered by a weak gov­ern­ment, a re­ces­sion and sharp spikes in re­cent weeks of Covid-19 in­fec­tions.</p>
    <p>In nor­mal times, the de­ci­sion by Malaysia’s sul­tans to re­ject the con­tro­ver­sial plan pre­sented by Mr Muhyid­din would have set the stage for a con­sti­tu­tional cri­sis.</p>
    <p>But in th­ese ex­tra­or­di­nary times for Malaysian pol­i­tics, key play­ers took ad­van­tage of the palace’s de­ci­sion to push new po­lit­i­cal re­align­ments that threat­ened to has­ten Mr Muhyid­din’s exit.</p>
    <p>Amid the grow­ing ten­sion trig­gered by the stun­ning palace re­buke, back­ers of the Pre­mier tried to put up a bold front, stress­ing that Mr Muhyid­din still en­joys the back­ing of the rulers be­cause the palace had en­dorsed his gov­ern­ment’s han­dling of the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>The palace’s calls for politi­cians to stop bick­er­ing and work to­gether to deal with the many chal­lenges re­sult­ing from the Covid-19 pan­demic have also been pre­sented as tacit sup­port from the sul­tans for the Pre­mier.</p>
    <p>But his op­po­nents have seized on a sep­a­rate state­ment re­leased by the Keeper of the Rulers’ Seal Syed Danial Syed Ah­mad that of­fered a dif­fer­ent insight into Sun­day’s meet­ing among the sul­tans.</p>
    <p>Tan Sri Syed Danial noted that the rulers stressed the im­por­tance of re­spect­ing the mech­a­nism of checks and bal­ances and the role of the King in en­sur­ing fair­ness and curb­ing the abuse of power.</p>
    <p>“In palace-speak, this is a sharp re­buke on what they think about the emer­gency bid (by the gov­ern­ment),” noted an Umno politi­cian aligned with Zahid, adding that what is likely to res­onate with the coun­try’s dom­i­nant eth­nic Malay pop­u­la­tion is that the Pre­mier can no longer hide be­hind the palace.</p>
    <p>The deep chasms in the Muhyid­din-led PN coali­tion, and within Umno, be­came pub­lic shortly af­ter Mr An­war de­clared late last month that he had se­cured a strong ma­jor­ity among elected MPs to form a new gov­ern­ment and claim the pre­mier­ship, a po­si­tion that has eluded him since 1998.</p>
    <p>Widely ru­moured but not pub­licly ver­i­fied was that Mr An­war had se­cured the back­ing of law­mak­ers within Umno led by party pres­i­dent Zahid and for­mer pre­mier Na­jib Razak in his bid to wrest power from the Muhyid­din gov­ern­ment. Doc­u­mented pledges of sup­port for the op­po­si­tion leader, in­clud­ing one signed by Zahid and Na­jib, found their way into the pub­lic do­main about 10 days ago, and were widely dis­trib­uted through so­cial me­dia.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, Umno party lead­ers with key Cabi­net po­si­tions in the gov­ern­ment pri­vately ha­rangued Zahid to re­tract the let­ter of sup­port, be­lieved to have been delivered to the King, Sul­tan Ab­dul­lah Ah­mad Shah.</p>
    <p>For­eign Min­is­ter and Umno leader Hisham­mud­din Hus­sein ve­he­mently ob­jected to back­ing Mr An­war, say­ing “no” to work­ing with him or the Chi­nese-based Demo­cratic Ac­tion Party (DAP), which is a part of the Pakatan Hara­pan pact led by Mr An­war.</p>
    <p>Se­nior Umno politi­cians also noted Zahid was sharply at­tacked by sev­eral of Mr Muhyid­din’s close al­lies in sep­a­rate closed-door meet­ings. One se­nior min­is­ter sug­gested that the Umno pres­i­dent de­clare pub­licly that the let­ter of sup­port was fake, which Zahid flatly re­fused to do.</p>
    <p>Zahid sought to cool ris­ing ten­sions within PN early last week when he urged a cease­fire and stressed that Umno would sup­port Mr Muhyid­din’s gov­ern­ment.</p>
    <p>But that move failed to re­pair the grow­ing trust deficit within the PN coali­tion to­wards the fac­tions led by Zahid and Na­jib.</p>
    <p>The An­war-Zahid-Na­jib troika had spooked Mr Muhyid­din and his al­lies. Se­nior Min­is­ter Azmin Ali and Home Min­is­ter Hamzah Zain­udin pushed Mr Muhyid­din to take tough mea­sures to quell op­po­si­tion to his pre­mier­ship.</p>
    <p>It was against this back­drop that Datuk Seri Azmin and Datuk Seri Hamzah con­vinced Mr Muhyid­din to em­brace the plan for the dec­la­ra­tion of a state of emer­gency.</p>
    <p>The re­jec­tion of the plan on Sun­day was a blow to Mr Muhyid­din’s po­lit­i­cal cred­i­bil­ity and it pre­sented the open­ing that Mr An­war had been hop­ing for in his bid to wrest con­trol of gov­ern­ment.</p>
    <p>It also strength­ened Zahid’s author­ity as party pres­i­dent, par­tic­u­larly against Umno lead­ers who are in the Muhyid­din Cabi­net, such as Datuk Seri</p>
    <p>Hisham­mud­din, De­fence Min­is­ter Is­mail Sabri Yaakob, and Mr Khairy Ja­malud­din, who is cur­rently serv­ing as Min­is­ter of Sci­ence Tech­nol­ogy and In­no­va­tion.</p>
    <p>Se­nior Umno lead­ers, in­clud­ing Zahid and his deputy Mo­hamad Hasan, snubbed an in­vi­ta­tion from Mr Muhyid­din for a meet­ing of lead­ers of PN com­po­nent par­ties on Mon­day morn­ing. They in­stead held sep­a­rate ses­sions with the party’s other po­lit­i­cal al­lies to dis­cuss whether to with­draw from PN and de­mand that the Pre­mier re­sign.</p>
    <p>Shortly af­ter lunch, for­mer pre­mier Na­jib, who is ap­peal­ing against his con­vic­tion for graft tied to the 1Malaysia De­vel­op­ment Ber­had scan­dal, would make pub­lic his readi­ness to work with Mr An­war.</p>
    <p>In a Face­book post, Na­jib said he had floated the idea of Umno work­ing with Mr An­war to form the gov­ern­ment, but that the pact can­not in­clude DAP.</p>
    <p>Be­hind the scenes, po­lit­i­cal lieu­tenants of Mr An­war and Na­jib were also work­ing fu­ri­ously to col­lect statu­tory dec­la­ra­tions from Umno MPs pledg­ing sup­port for the op­po­si­tion leader, ac­cord­ing to Umno politi­cians close to Zahid and Na­jib. One Umno politi­cian noted that by late Mon­day, both sides had col­lected pledges of sup­port from more than 20 Umno law­mak­ers.</p>
    <p>But Zahid, who is fac­ing 47 charges of cor­rup­tion and money laun­der­ing, was be­gin­ning to wa­ver in his back­ing for Mr</p>
    <p>An­war.</p>
    <p>Af­ter the Umno Supreme Coun­cil, the party’s chief pol­i­cy­mak­ing body, held a meet­ing on Mon­day night – which lasted more than four hours and was chaired by Zahid – the party de­cided to con­tinue back­ing Mr Muhyid­din. The de­ci­sion sent shock waves to both the An­war and Na­jib camps.</p>
    <p>It is not clear what caused Zahid to change his mind.</p>
    <p>But there is a grow­ing con­sen­sus among politi­cians on both sides of the di­vide that this re­turn to sta­tus quo is far from sta­ble and Malaysia’s sul­tans may once again be called upon to nudge the coun­try’s po­lit­i­cal elite to­wards find­ing some com­mon ground.</p>
