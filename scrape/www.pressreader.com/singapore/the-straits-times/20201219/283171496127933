    <p>He’s al­ways cop­ing with chal­lenges, and even with the tight sched­ule, Liver­pool have been on a good run, and I am con­fi­dent the fo­cus of the team is there and we can start with the three points against Palace.</p>
    <p>De­spite a daunt­ing fix­ture sched­ule and mounting in­jury list, for­mer Liver­pool striker Dirk Kuyt is back­ing the Reds to con­tinue their good form and ace the fes­tive pe­riod to keep their spot at the top of the Pre­mier League.</p>
    <p>The Dutch­man’s faith lies in man­ager Jur­gen Klopp.</p>
    <p>Cham­pi­ons Liver­pool visit Crys­tal Palace to­day in what will be their fifth game in 13 days, be­fore a run of four games in 13 days af­ter Christ­mas.</p>
    <p>With se­ri­ous in­juries to skip­per Vir­gil van Dijk, Joe Gomez, James Mil­ner, Thi­ago Al­can­tara and Diogo Jota, Klopp has voiced his frus­tra­tions about the sched­ul­ing and has pushed for an in­crease in the num­ber of sub­sti­tu­tions al­lowed, from three to five each game.</p>
    <p>In a phone in­ter­view on the eve of the Palace game, Kuyt told The Straits Times: “I think the ar­gu­ments Jur­gen made can ap­pear crit­i­cal but they are right. He will fight for his team and his play­ers, to make the sit­u­a­tion as per­fect for them as pos­si­ble. But he is ready.</p>
    <p>“He’s al­ways cop­ing with chal­lenges, and even with the tight sched­ule, Liver­pool have been on a good run, and I am con­fi­dent the fo­cus of the team is there and we can start with the three points against Palace.”</p>
    <p>Kuyt, who scored 71 goals in 286 games for Liver­pool be­tween 2006 and 2012, added Klopp “com­pletely de­serves” the Coach of the Year gong he picked up for a sec­ond con­sec­u­tive year on Thurs­day at the an­nual Fifa Best Awards.</p>
    <p>“If you talk to the play­ers and staff at Liver­pool, they’re all so pos­i­tive and speak so highly about his qual­ity as a man­ager and also as a hu­man be­ing,” said the 40-yearold. “And even af­ter win­ning the Cham­pi­ons League and bring­ing the Pre­mier League ti­tle back to Liver­pool, he’s still very hun­gry for more suc­cess.”</p>
    <p>Suc­cess this sea­son may re­quire some signings in the Jan­uary trans­fer win­dow given that no Pre­mier League club have more play­ers out in­jured than Liver­pool (eight).</p>
    <p>The Reds have been linked to Bun­desliga cen­tre-backs Ibrahima Konate, Dayot Upame­cano (both RB Leipzig) and Ozan Kabak (Schalke), as well as Ajax Am­s­ter­dam’s Perr Schu­urs.</p>
    <p>But Kuyt said: “It’s dif­fi­cult to say what will hap­pen, but if you look at Cur­tis Jones, who has had a good run in the team… I think it’s a strength of the club to de­velop young­sters in the squad.</p>
    <p>“When Trent (Alexan­derArnold) or (Andy) Robert­son came into the team, they were young too, but now they are cru­cial play­ers. So I would love to see youth con­tinue to come through.”</p>

    <p>DAN­GER­OUS SIDE</p>
    <p>They’re tac­ti­cally very or­gan­ised, play a very com­pact game, and of­fen­sively they’re quite good on the counter as well.</p>
    <p>Wales man­ager Chris Cole­man be­lieves Klopp may be forced to dip into the trans­fer mar­ket.</p>
    <p>“I think Jur­gen will speak to his med­i­cal team and see how long be­fore they are fit, and if some of them don’t come back by March, he’ll have to in­vest be­cause the pe­riod from Jan­uary to March can de­cide who wins the league,” said the 50-year-old.</p>
    <p>The Welsh­man, a for­mer Palace de­fender, also warned that his old team could trip up their ri­vals.</p>
    <p>“Palace have proven they’re a good Pre­mier League team over the last four or five sea­sons, and I don’t think it would be much of a sur­prise if they are able to get a draw,” said Cole­man.</p>
    <p>“They’re tac­ti­cally very or­gan­ised, play a very com­pact game, and of­fen­sively they’re quite good on the counter as well, with Eberechi Eze and Wil­fried Zaha. Liver­pool will have to be care­ful.”</p>
    <p>Dirk Kuyt and Chris Cole­man spoke to The Straits Times as part of Chang Beer and Sing­Tel Me­dia’s Chang Foot­ball Mo­ments vir­tual screen­ing of the Liver­pool v Crys­tal Palace match. The duo will watch the game and en­ter­tain ques­tions in a fan Q&A ses­sion.</p>
