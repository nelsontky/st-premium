    <p>TRIB­UTES TO CAR­RIE FISHER: Amer­i­can ac­tress Bil­lie Lourd, daugh­ter of Star Wars leg­end Car­rie</p>
    <p>Fisher, has taken to so­cial me­dia to send her “love and strength” to ev­ery­one who has lost a loved one, on Fisher’s fourth death an­niver­sary.</p>
    <p>In an In­sta­gram post on Sun­day, Lourd, 28, posted a photo of her walk­ing in the streets with Fisher (right) and wrote: “Send­ing my love and strength to ev­ery­one out there that’s miss­ing a loved one they’ve lost. Es­pe­cially those of you who have lost some­one dur­ing this crazy year. You’re not alone.”</p>
    <p>Lourd is the daugh­ter of Fisher and tal­ent agent Bryan Lourd, 60.</p>
    <p>Fisher, best known for her role as Princess Leia in the Star Wars movies, died of compli­cations aris­ing from sleep ap­noea at the age of 60 on Dec 27, 2016. A day later, her mother Deb­bie Reynolds, who won hearts as a star of the mu­si­cal film Sin­gin’ In The Rain (1952), died at the age of 84.</p>
    <p>Amer­i­can ac­tor Mark Hamill, 69, also paid trib­ute to Fisher on so­cial me­dia. Hamill, who played Leia’s brother Luke Sky­walker in the Star Wars films, posted a mock-up of the Star Wars end cred­its, with the words “In Lov­ing Mem­ory of our Princess Car­rie</p>
    <p>Fisher”, with the hash­tag #Al­waysWithUs.</p>
    <p>Fisher first played Princess Leia at 21 in Star Wars (1977) be­fore repris­ing the role in The Em­pire Strikes Back (1980), Return Of The Jedi (1983), The Force Awak­ens (2015) and The Last Jedi (2017). She died be­fore the pro­duc­tion of The Rise Of Sky­walker (2019).</p>
    <p>She can still be seen in last year’s movie, through the in­cor­po­ra­tion of un­used, re-cut footage from The Force Awak­ens.</p>
