    <p>In the early weeks of the coro­n­avirus out­break, re­called Mr An­thony Tan, chief ex­ec­u­tive of­fi­cer of South-east Asia’s big­gest ride­hail­ing firm, he mis­took the in­fec­tion to be a China-only prob­lem, sim­i­lar to Sars or the se­vere acute res­pi­ra­tory syn­drome in 2003.</p>
    <p>As Covid-19 turned into a pan­demic, send­ing mar­kets into a tail­spin, the 38-year-old sought ad­vice from ti­tans among his in­vestors, in­clud­ing SoftBank founder Masayoshi Son and Mi­crosoft CEO Satya Nadella.</p>
    <p>The mes­sage was clear. No one knew how long the cri­sis would last or how deep it would be. Mr Tan, who co-founded Grab in 2012 with fel­low Harvard Busi­ness School alum­nus Tan Hooi Lin, learnt he had to set thresh­olds and make de­ci­sive moves, even if they were un­pop­u­lar. “There’s no more de­bate, it’s just ex­e­cu­tion,” he said.</p>
    <p>In June, the Sin­ga­pore-based com­pany laid off around 360 em­ploy­ees, just un­der 5 per cent of its head­count, after slash­ing dis­cre­tionary spend­ing.</p>
    <p>“I re­mem­ber tears couldn’t stop rolling down my face. I don’t ever want to go through it again,” Mr Tan said in his first in­ter­view since the lay­offs.</p>
    <p>The pan­demic is the first cri­sis for South-east Asia’s decade-old start-up ecosys­tem from which Grab has emerged as a house­hold name and the most valu­able firm at over US$14 bil­lion (S$19.2 bil­lion).</p>
    <p>Grab says its app has seen a to­tal of 198 mil­lion down­loads, al­though it has yet to turn prof­itable.</p>
    <p>As coro­n­avirus mea­sures put the re­gion of 650 mil­lion peo­ple un­der lock­down, Grab saw de­mand erod­ing for its trans­port busi­ness, but then nearly 150,000 of its driv­ers switched to be­com­ing de­liv­ery men for home-bound cus­tomers.</p>
    <p>“Food de­liv­ery has be­come the norm, gro­cery de­liv­ery is growing very fast, cash­less pay­ments are growing very fast, so these be­hav­iours have changed per­ma­nently with or without a vac­cine, and we’ve been ben­e­fi­cia­ries,” said Mr Tan, who is pre­par­ing Grab for a fu­ture in which its users will at least par­tially work from home.</p>
    <p>“You couldn’t ask for a bet­ter hedge,” Mr Tan said in the liv­ing room of his Sin­ga­pore pent­house, where he of­ten spends 15 hours a day at his stand­ing desk, some­times ex­er­cis­ing with dumb­bells.</p>
    <p>The com­pany, which counts In­done­sia as its big­gest mar­ket and is locked in a fierce com­pe­ti­tion there with Jakarta-based Go­jek, is dou­bling down on de­liv­er­ies, with its two-year-old food busi­ness over­tak­ing the ma­ture trans­port di­vi­sion as its big­gest seg­ment.</p>
    <p>It has had to scale back plans for its travel and hos­pi­tal­ity ser­vice ver­ti­cals as con­sumers stayed at home, but its fi­nance busi­ness has been boosted by surg­ing dig­i­tal pay­ments and small busi­nesses seek­ing work­ing cap­i­tal loans. The fi­nan­cial ser­vices busi­ness in­cludes wealth man­age­ment, in­sur­ance and lend­ing.</p>
    <p>The com­pany, which says it has more than nine mil­lion driv­ers, mer­chants and agents, is also await­ing the re­sult of its ap­pli­ca­tion for an on­line bank­ing li­cence in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>While the pan­demic ini­tially led to short-term think­ing in a fight for sur­vival, Mr Tan said work­ing from home for months and con­sul­ta­tions with lead­ers from around the world have made him re­flect and think longer-term.</p>
    <p>By “also just be­ing in­sane and mi­cro­scopic about costs”, Grab was now on a faster path to profitabil­ity, Mr Tan said, without giv­ing a time-frame.</p>
    <p>Mr Foo Jixun, man­ag­ing part­ner at GGV Cap­i­tal and an early backer of Grab, said speed was key.</p>
    <p>“In good times, ev­ery­body is grab­bing mar­ket share. When the tide turns, the best com­pa­nies re­spond the fastest, they cor­rect the fastest in terms of their busi­ness,” he said.</p>
