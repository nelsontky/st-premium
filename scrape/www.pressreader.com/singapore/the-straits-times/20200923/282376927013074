    <p>LON­DON • Sh­effield United man­ager Chris Wilder’s un­happy re­la­tion­ship with VAR (video as­sis­tant ref­eree) reached an­other low on Mon­day as his side lost 1-0 at As­ton Villa hav­ing played most of the Premier League match with 10 men.</p>
    <p>Wilder was left con­fused af­ter John Egan was shown a red card in the 12th minute for an ap­par­ent tug on the shirt of Villa striker Ol­lie Watkins who was running clear.</p>
    <p>Ref­eree Gra­ham Scott was some distance from the in­ci­dent but de­cided, even though his as­sis­tant did not flag for a foul, that the chal­lenge had de­nied a scor­ing op­por­tu­nity and sent Egan off for an early shower.</p>
    <p>Wilder, who was late for his news con­fer­ence af­ter try­ing to quiz the ref­eree on the i nci­dent, said it should have been checked by VAR and Scott should have taken an­other look for him­self on the pitch­side mon­i­tor.</p>
    <p>“I just don’t un­der­stand why that de­ci­sion was first made as a straight red and no di­a­logue with the as­sis­tant ref­eree. His ac­tions are a give­away,” he said.</p>
    <p>“It’s dif­fi­cult to be com­pletely 100 per cent cer­tain from Gra­ham’s po­si­tion be­hind both play­ers that they were not grab­bing each other.</p>
    <p>“My big ar­gu­ment was that the as­sis­tant ref­eree was 10 yards away and had the clear­est view and he made a de­ci­sion not to wave his flag for a foul.</p>
    <p>“I am com­pletely con­fused as a pro­fes­sional player and man­ager for the last 35 years. I am at my most con­fused about the de­ci­sions be­ing made. I am even more con­fused tonight.”</p>
    <p>Wilder’s team were de­nied a clear goal against Villa in June when goalline tech­nol­ogy failed in the first game af­ter the Premier League restarted from the Covid-19 shut­down.</p>
    <p>Last sea­son, Sh­effield United also had a goal dis­al­lowed by VAR at Tot­ten­ham Hot­spur when John Lund­stram’s toe was ruled to be off­side af­ter a lengthy de­ci­sion-mak­ing process.</p>
    <p>To make mat­ters worse on Mon­day, Wilder felt that Villa’s Matt Tar­gett should have been sent off when fouling Chris Basham to con­cede a first-half penalty, which Lund­stram then had his shot well saved by goal­keeper Emil­iano Martinez.</p>
    <p>Ezri Konsa’s 63rd-minute header then en­sured a pos­i­tive start for Dean Smith’s side who last sea­son es­caped rel­e­ga­tion by the skin of their teeth.</p>
    <p>“Bash does great and puts him­self be­tween the ball and the man, there’s no way in a mil­lion years he can wrap his foot round the ball and make the tackle. He im­pedes our player, a chance de­nied and it’s a red card,” Wilder said.</p>
    <p>“It can’t be dou­ble jeop­ardy, it’s a red card, he’s stopped a goalscor­ing chance. Even if he misses the penalty it’s still 10 vs 10.”</p>
