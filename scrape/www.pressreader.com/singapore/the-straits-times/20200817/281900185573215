    <p>LON­DON • The United King­dom sus­pended new cri­te­ria for ap­peal­ing against exam re­sults in Eng­land used to gain en­try to uni­ver­si­ties just hours after their pub­li­ca­tion, fur­ther stok­ing pub­lic out­rage over the govern­ment’s han­dling of the process dur­ing the Covid-19 pan­demic.</p>
    <p>The Of­fice of Qual­i­fi­ca­tions and Ex­am­i­na­tions Reg­u­la­tion early yes­ter­day said the new ap­peals cri­te­ria pub­lished on Satur­day af­ter­noon were now “be­ing re­viewed”.</p>
    <p>The ap­peals process was due to be­gin to­day, and the new guide­lines al­lowed more lee­way for rais­ing grades after hun­dreds of thou­sands of stu­dents re­ceived lower marks than pro­jected by their schools.</p>
    <p>The lock­down in March meant Bri­tain’s 16- and 18-year-olds were un­able to sit their usual ex­am­i­na­tions, which are used for job and uni­ver­sity ap­pli­ca­tions.</p>
    <p>In­stead, the govern­ment said grades would be based on an al­go­rithm com­bin­ing teach­ers’ pre­dic­tions, the stu­dents’ past test scores and – con­tro­ver­sially – the re­sults achieved by pre­vi­ous stu­dents at their schools.</p>
    <p>That prompted a back­lash from stu­dents after more than a third of stu­dents had pre­dicted grades down­graded, with young peo­ple from eco­nom­i­cally dis­ad­van­taged places harder hit by the changes.</p>
    <p>Stu­dents protested out­side the govern­ment’s head­quar­ters in Lon­don last Fri­day, call­ing for Ed­u­ca­tion Sec­re­tary Gavin Wil­liamson to re­sign, and par­ents are weigh­ing law­suits, the Sunday Times re­ported.</p>
    <p>The re­lease of the exam re­sults last Thursday was cov­ered live, with tele­vi­sion net­works like the BBC hold­ing in­ter­views with dis­traught stu­dents learn­ing they would be de­nied places at their cho­sen uni­ver­si­ties.</p>
    <p>That process may be played out again on Thursday, when the re­sults of the GCSEs, ex­ams taken by 16-year-olds, are made pub­lic.</p>
    <p>Mr Keir Starmer, leader of the op­po­si­tion Labour Party, said on Twit­ter yes­ter­day: “We need to end this fiasco.”</p>
    <p>Last Fri­day, the day after the exam re­sults were re­leased, Mr Wil­liamson an­nounced the govern­ment will make the ap­peals process free of charge so teach­ers would not be de­terred from mak­ing ap­peals. The fees are usu­ally paid by schools.</p>
    <p>Even a suc­cess­ful ap­peal could force stu­dents to de­fer start­ing uni­ver­sity, as many uni­ver­si­ties will not be able to keep places avail­able even if the process can be wrapped up be­fore the start of the Septem­ber term.</p>
    <p>The govern­ment has said stu­dents would be able to choose the high­est of their cal­cu­lated grades, the re­sult of an exam taken later in the year, or the out­come of a “mock” exam from the start of the year.</p>
    <p>The process an­nounced last Satur­day lays out what will de­ter­mine a valid mock as­sess­ment for an ap­peal of the test re­sults in Eng­land.</p>
    <p>The new cri­te­ria raised the pos­si­bil­ity of the grades be­ing based on</p>
    <p>“non-exam as­sess­ments”.</p>
    <p>“We want to make sure this op­por­tu­nity is avail­able to a wide range of stu­dents, in­clud­ing those who had not taken a writ­ten mock exam be­fore schools and col­leges closed,” the govern­ment of­fice said in the Satur­day state­ment. We will there­fore al­low a non-exam as­sess­ment mark to be used too.”</p>
    <p>There had al­ready been a back­lash against how this pol­icy was ap­plied in Scot­land, which has a sep­a­rate ex­am­i­na­tion sys­tem.</p>
    <p>The Scot­tish govern­ment later or­dered a re­ver­sal of the down­grad­ing and in­stead awarded af­fected stu­dents the re­sults es­ti­mated by their teach­ers.</p>
