    <p>WASH­ING­TON • The US Congress has dealt Mr Don­ald Trump a hu­mil­i­at­ing blow in his last days in of­fice, with the Se­nate vot­ing over­whelm­ingly to over­ride his veto of a sweep­ing de­fence Bill – the first time law­mak­ers have done so dur­ing his pres­i­dency.</p>
    <p>Meet­ing in a rare New Year’s Day ses­sion, sen­a­tors voted 81-13 to se­cure the two-thirds ma­jor­ity needed to over­ride the veto.</p>
    <p>Eight pre­vi­ous Trump ve­toes had been up­held and, un­til Fri­day’s vote, he had been on track to be the first pres­i­dent since Mr Lyn­don John­son with none over­rid­den.</p>
    <p>The Repub­li­can-led Se­nate also ended for now a push by Democrats to in­crease Covid-19 fi­nan­cial re­lief cheques from US$600 (S$793) to US$2,000, a change sought by Mr Trump.</p>
    <p>Repub­li­can law­mak­ers have largely stood by the Pres­i­dent dur­ing his tur­bu­lent White House term. Since los­ing his re-elec­tion bid in Novem­ber, how­ever, Mr Trump has lashed out at them for not fully back­ing his un­sup­ported claims of voter fraud, re­ject­ing his de­mand for big­ger Covid-19 re­lief cheques and mov­ing to over­ride his veto.</p>
    <p>In another set­back for Mr Trump, a judge re­jected a law­suit filed by a Texas law­maker and other Repub­li­cans against Vice</p>
    <p>Pres­i­dent Mike Pence, seek­ing to over­turn Demo­cratic Pres­i­den­t­elect Joe Bi­den’s win.</p>
    <p>Judge Jeremy Kern­odle of the East­ern Dis­trict of Texas ruled that Repub­li­can law­mak­ers, led by Rep­re­sen­ta­tive Louie Gohmert of Texas, lacked the proper stand­ing to sue Mr Pence in the mat­ter.</p>
    <p>Mr Pence is set to pre­side on Wed­nes­day over a joint ses­sion of Congress to for­malise the re­sults of the elec­tion.</p>
    <p>The law­suit chal­lenged the more than cen­tury-old law that gov­erns the Elec­toral Col­lege process, in an at­tempt to ex­pand the Vice-Pres­i­dent’s other­wise cer­e­mo­nial role into one with the power to re­ject elec­toral votes that were cast for Mr Bi­den.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump has con­tin­ued to falsely claim that Mr Bi­den un­fairly won the elec­tion be­cause of wide­spread voter fraud, and has de­manded that con­gres­sional Repub­li­cans work to over­turn the re­sults.</p>
    <p>But there has been no ev­i­dence of wide­spread im­pro­pri­ety, and for­mer at­tor­ney-gen­eral Wil­liam Barr has ac­knowl­edged that the Jus­tice Depart­ment un­cov­ered no such fraud that would have changed the out­come.</p>
    <p>The Supreme Court and courts in at least eight crit­i­cal states across the coun­try have sim­i­larly re­jected or dis­missed challenges the Trump cam­paign has waged in an at­tempt to throw out the re­sults of the elec­tion.</p>
    <p>Those challenges have not come close to over­turn­ing the re­sults in a sin­gle state.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump was orig­i­nally sched­uled to at­tend a New Year’s Eve party at his Mar-a-Lago re­sort but he re­turned to Wash­ing­ton early.</p>
    <p>The White House has given no rea­son for this but it co­in­cides with his fight with Congress over his veto of the de­fence Bill and his de­mand for in­creased Covid-19 stim­u­lus cheques, as well as a spike in ten­sions with Iran.</p>
    <p>The Democrat-con­trolled House of Rep­re­sen­ta­tives on Mon­day voted to over­ride Mr Trump’s de­fence Bill veto.</p>
    <p>A pres­i­dent has the power to veto a Bill passed by Congress. But law­mak­ers can up­hold the Bill if two-thirds of both houses vote to over­ride the veto. The US$740 bil­lion Na­tional De­fence Au­tho­ri­sa­tion Act (NDAA) de­ter­mines every­thing from how many ships are bought to soldiers’ pay to how to ad­dress geopo­lit­i­cal threats.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump re­fused to sign it into law be­cause it did not re­peal cer­tain le­gal pro­tec­tions for so­cial me­dia plat­forms and in­cluded a pro­vi­sion strip­ping the names of Con­fed­er­ate gen­er­als from mil­i­tary bases.</p>
    <p>“We’ve passed this leg­is­la­tion 59 years in a row. And one way or another, we’re go­ing to com­plete the 60th an­nual NDAA and pass it into law be­fore this Congress con­cludes on Sun­day,” Se­nate Repub­li­can Leader Mitch McCon­nell said ahead of the vote.</p>
    <p>As votes were be­ing counted in­di­cat­ing Mr Trump had lost, the Pres­i­dent took to Twit­ter to tout a protest rally be­ing planned in Wash­ing­ton on Wed­nes­day, when the new Congress meets to of­fi­cially tally the Elec­toral Col­lege votes cer­ti­fy­ing Mr Bi­den’s vic­tory.</p>
    <p>Some Trump al­lies have said they plan to ob­ject on Mr Trump’s be­half, in­clud­ing Se­na­tor Josh Haw­ley who ex­pects to be joined by as many as 140 House Repub­li­cans, but the ob­jec­tions are ex­pected to be dis­missed by the ma­jor­ity of law­mak­ers.</p>
    <p>But Mr Haw­ley’s de­ci­sion to chal­lenge the re­sults has ex­posed the rift in the party be­tween those anx­ious to move on from Mr Trump’s false claims and those clam­our­ing to meet the Pres­i­dent’s de­mand.</p>
    <p>Mr Haw­ley ac­knowl­edged he is still undecided about how many state elec­tion re­sults will be the tar­gets of his ob­jec­tions.</p>
    <p>Repub­li­can Se­na­tor Ben Sasse blasted the move in a Face­book post on Wed­nes­day, say­ing: “Adults don’t point a loaded gun at the heart of le­git­i­mate self-govern­ment.”</p>
    <p>In a tweet, Mr Trump de­nounced the Se­nate’s re­fusals to lift le­gal pro­tec­tions for so­cial me­dia plat­forms or take up his call for more Covid-19 re­lief as “pa­thetic” and “not fair, or smart”.</p>
    <p>The US$740 bil­lion Na­tional De­fence Au­tho­ri­sa­tion Act de­ter­mines every­thing from how many ships are bought to soldiers’ pay to how to ad­dress geopo­lit­i­cal threats.</p>
    <p>Eight pre­vi­ous Trump ve­toes had been up­held and, un­til Fri­day’s vote, he had been on track to be the first pres­i­dent since Mr Lyn­don John­son with none over­rid­den.</p>

        <p data-role="text">Ahead of the vote, Se&#xAD;nate Repub&#xAD;li&#xAD;can Leader&#xD;&#xA;Mitch McCon&#xAD;nell (cen&#xAD;tre) noted that law&#xAD;mak&#xAD;ers had sup&#xAD;ported the de&#xAD;fence Bill for 59 years in a row, and that they would do the same again for the new Bill. Meet&#xAD;ing in a rare New Year&#x2019;s Day ses&#xAD;sion, sen&#xAD;a&#xAD;tors voted 81-13 to gain the two-thirds ma&#xAD;jor&#xAD;ity needed to over&#xAD;turn Mr Don&#xAD;ald Trump&#x2019;s veto, mark&#xAD;ing another ma&#xAD;jor set&#xAD;back for him in his fi&#xAD;nal days in of&#xAD;fice.</p>
