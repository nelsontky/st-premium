    <p>A 14-year-old boy ac­cused of mur­der­ing his fa­ther had his case ad­journed to Feb 17 af­ter the po­lice said they needed more time to com­plete their in­ves­ti­ga­tion.</p>
    <p>One of his de­fence lawyers, Mr Shashi Nathan, told The Straits Times that med­i­cal, psy­chi­atric and foren­sic re­ports linked to the case are also not ready.</p>
    <p>With the ad­journ­ment, the teenager will re­main in re­mand at a boys’ home. He was not of­fered bail at the Youth Courts yes­ter­day as he faces a mur­der charge.</p>
    <p>De­tails about the boy and his fam­ily can­not be re­vealed as in­di­vid­u­als un­der 18 years old are covered un­der t he Chil­dren and Young Per­sons Act.</p>
    <p>The Sin­ga­porean is ac­cused of mur­der­ing his 49-year-old fa­ther at a unit at Edel­weiss Park con­do­minium in Flora Road, near Loyang Av­enue, at around 10am on Dec 11 last year.</p>
    <p>The man was found in­jured and mo­tion­less. He was taken un­con­scious to Changi Gen­eral Hos­pi­tal, where he later died.</p>
    <p>The boy, who was in the same unit, was ar­rested.</p>
    <p>He is rep­re­sented by lawyers from With­ers Khat­tarWong.</p>
    <p>While of­fend­ers con­victed of mur­der could be given the death penalty, those below 18 do not re­ceive the death sen­tence, but may be im­pris­oned for life.</p>
