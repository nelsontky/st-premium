    <p>When Ms Lee Bee Wah went on her usual walk­a­bout at a mar­ket in Yishun on July 5, she was greeted by res­i­dents who pleaded with her not to re­tire and to stay on as their MP.</p>
    <p>Ms Lee, 59, who rep­re­sented the Nee Soon South ward for 14 years, teared up as she thanked the res­i­dents, say­ing she would “never for­get them”.</p>
    <p>“The last 14 years have been very mem­o­rable. I made a lot of friends. They be­came my family mem­bers,” she said.</p>
    <p>First elected in 2006, Ms Lee – one of the most colour­ful Peo­ple’s Ac­tion Party (PAP) back­benchers in re­cent mem­ory – has, over the years, stirred strong feel­ings among fans and critics alike.</p>
    <p>Known af­fec­tion­ately as “Hua Jie” (which means “flower sis­ter”), she was a grass­roots MP to be feared, as she re­fused to take “no” for an an­swer, bad­ger­ing min­is­ters and pub­lic ser­vants to se­cure es­tate im­prove­ments sought by her res­i­dents.</p>
    <p>She was also a feisty de­fender of gov­ern­ment poli­cies against op­po­si­tion at­tack. Her speeches dur­ing Par­lia­ment de­bates on the Bud­get stood out, in­clud­ing one last year when she told a story en­ti­tled Si Gui Kia, a Hokkien phrase which means “un­grate­ful brat”.</p>
    <p>In it, she por­trayed the Gov­ern­ment as a gen­er­ous grand­fa­ther (“Ah Gong”) who cares for his un­grate­ful grand­son (“Ah Seng”), the lat­ter rep­re­sent­ing Sin­ga­pore­ans who failed to ap­pre­ci­ate gov­ern­ment largesse.</p>
    <p>That earned her brick­bats from those an­gered by the com­par­i­son and who replied on­line that the Gov­ern­ment was not their Ah Gong and they were not in­grates.</p>
    <p>She also went on the of­fen­sive against the op­po­si­tion’s call to vot­ers to elect more non-PAP MPs. She said it was she and not an op­po­si­tion MP who stood up in the House and ar­gued for a child­care cen­tre to be built in ev­ery Hous­ing Board precinct, and for more sports fa­cil­i­ties and cov­ered linkways from HDB blocks to bus stops.</p>
    <p>She also cham­pi­oned is­sues con­cern­ing tra­di­tional Chi­nese medicine and the con­struc­tion in­dus­try, she told re­porters trail­ing her and PAP new face Car­rie Tan, who is part of the Nee Soon GRC slate.</p>
    <p>She said she made her MP job her “No. 1 pri­or­ity”. “I heard some­body say that after the day­time job, how to do an MP job at night? Tir­ing.</p>
    <p>That’s why you need a full-time MP,” she said. “You ask my res­i­dents, I am here al­most ev­ery day, ev­ery night. I don’t have free nights at home.”</p>
    <p>Re­fer­ring to Ms Tan, who takes over from her in Nee Soon South, Ms Lee said: “I am glad that I have Car­rie, 38 years old, young, en­er­getic. Give her a chance, and I will men­tor her.”</p>
    <p>Among those who turned up to thank Ms Lee was Ms Jo Lee, a res­i­dent in her 50s who has lived in Yishun since 1986. She said Ms Lee</p>
    <p>UN­FOR­GET­TABLE TIME</p>
    <p>The last 14 years have been very mem­o­rable. I made a lot of friends. They be­came ’’ my family mem­bers.</p>
