    <p>As­so­ciate Pro­fes­sor Stephen Lim spent much of his child­hood daz­zling au­di­ences in re­gional and in­ter­na­tional com­pe­ti­tions with his mas­tery of the elec­tric or­gan.</p>
    <p>When it came to choos­ing a ca­reer, how­ever, he put aside plans to be­come a pi­anist and com­poser, and chose academia.</p>
    <p>To­day, Prof Lim is a psy­chol­ogy lec­turer at the Na­tional Univer­sity of Sin­ga­pore (NUS), and he has found a way to com­bine both his pas­sions by ap­ply­ing his re­search in psy­chol­ogy to teach­ing and learn­ing mu­sic. He also works with sev­eral mu­sic con­ser­va­to­ries in Asia, in­clud­ing the Col­lege of Mu­sic in Thai­land’s Mahi­dol Univer­sity and the Yong Siew Toh Con­ser­va­tory of Mu­sic at NUS.</p>
    <p>Last Fri­day, he was one of seven peo­ple lauded for their contributi­ons at the NUS Univer­sity Awards. He was given the Out­stand­ing Ed­u­ca­tor Award for his work.</p>
    <p>Un­der­grad­u­ate projects su­per­vised by Prof Lim have won the NUS Out­stand­ing Un­der­grad­u­ate Re­searcher Prize four times – in 2012, 2016, last year and this year.</p>
    <p>SingHealth group chief ex­ec­u­tive Ivy Ng was given the Out­stand­ing Ser­vice Award for her contributi­ons to the univer­sity and the com­mu­nity.</p>
    <p>NUS, in a state­ment last Fri­day, said SingHealth has grown un­der Pro­fes­sor Ng’s lead­er­ship to be­come the largest public health­care clus­ter in Sin­ga­pore, and ac­counts for 50 per cent of to­tal pa­tient vis­its in the public sec­tor.</p>
    <p>Prof Ng said: “Be­ing in health­care is very mean­ing­ful as it al­lows us to help peo­ple in their great­est time of need and where it truly mat­ters – their health and im­prov­ing their qual­ity of life.”</p>
    <p>As­so­ciate Pro­fes­sor Ho Han Kiat from the Depart­ment of Phar­macy at NUS’ Fac­ulty of Sci­ence re­ceived the Out­stand­ing Ed­u­ca­tor Award.</p>
    <p>Prof Ho helped de­velop the phar­ma­ceu­ti­cal sci­ence de­gree pro­gramme at NUS in 2018.</p>
    <p>He said: “It is our hope that we can groom a ver­sa­tile and re­li­able pool of grad­u­ates to nour­ish the growth across phar­ma­ceu­ti­cal and biotech­no­log­i­cal in­dus­tries, and strengthen Sin­ga­pore’s position as the re­gional hub for the biomed­i­cal sec­tor.”</p>
    <p>Pro­fes­sor Dong Jin Song from the NUS’ School of Com­put­ing was given the Univer­sity Re­search Recog­ni­tion Award for devel­op­ing a soft­ware ver­i­fi­ca­tion frame­work that has more than 4,000 users from over 150 coun­tries, said the NUS state­ment.</p>
    <p>Pro­fes­sor Dario Cam­pana from the Depart­ment of Pae­di­atrics at NUS’ Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine re­ceived the Univer­sity Re­search Recog­ni­tion Award. He has won in­ter­na­tional plau­dits for his work on treat­ing acute lym­phoblas­tic leukaemia – the most com­mon form of cancer in chil­dren, NUS said in the state­ment.</p>
    <p>Other win­ners in­clude As­sis­tant Pro­fes­sor Feng Ji­ashi, who re­ceived the Young Re­searcher Award for his work on devel­op­ing a face recog­ni­tion model, and As­so­ciate Pro­fes­sor Ash­ley St John from Duke-NUS Med­i­cal School, who was awarded the Young Re­searcher Award.</p>
