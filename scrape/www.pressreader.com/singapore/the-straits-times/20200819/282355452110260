    <p>LIS­BON • For the first time in 13 years, there is no Span­ish team in the semi-fi­nals of the Cham­pi­ons League.</p>
    <p>The way in which Barcelona were dumped out, with an 8-2 de­feat by</p>
    <p>Bay­ern Mu­nich, has em­phat­i­cally ended the era of La Liga supremacy. There was one ba­sic sim­i­lar­ity in the way the Cata­lan gi­ants, Real Madrid and Atletico Madrid ex­ited Europe this sea­son – they sim­ply looked too slow.</p>
    <p>It is not that their play­ers lack speed in­di­vid­u­ally but that their styles of play lack the in­ten­sity and dy­namism, re­lent­less press­ing of the top Ger­man and English teams.</p>
    <p>The Span­ish sides are not able to at­tack with that same force­ful­ness, to turn from de­fence to at­tack in a mat­ter of sec­onds, and they also strug­gle de­fen­sively to han­dle teams that play in such a man­ner.</p>
    <p>Barcelona’s ca­pit­u­la­tion was the most bla­tant ex­am­ple of how far be­hind Spain has fallen in terms of the tac­ti­cal evo­lu­tion of the game.</p>
    <p>Less than a decade ago, it was the cut­ting edge of mod­ern foot­ball – its tiki-taka game and supreme con­trol of pos­ses­sion sim­ply passed op­po­nents to death.</p>
    <p>But an of­ten un­der­es­ti­mated part of the Barca way un­der Pep Guardi­ola, which brought Cham­pi­ons League ti­tles in 2009 and 2011, was just how quickly his team could re­trieve the ball once they had lost it. There was lit­tle sense of that hunger to quickly seize back con­trol from the Ger­mans last Fri­day.</p>
    <p>More re­cently, Real Madrid’s suc­cesses in Europe, with four Cham­pi­ons League ti­tles be­tween 2014 and 2018, came with a dif­fer­ent style. But since the de­par­ture of Cris­tiano Ron­aldo, they have lost their fear fac­tor and like Barca, they have strug­gled when try­ing to play the ball out from the back against an ag­gres­sive press.</p>
    <p>Atletico Madrid built their suc­cess un­der Diego Sime­one on a plat­form of de­fen­sive sound­ness and a clin­i­cal counter-at­tack.</p>
    <p>But they have lost that at­tack­ing el­e­ment, shorn of the in­ven­tion of An­toine Griez­mann and with Diego Costa no longer the dan­ger he once was.</p>
    <p>The one team in Spain that is the clos­est to the mod­ern form of play­ing are Sevilla, who are the last La Liga team left in Europe and will take on In­ter Mi­lan in Sun­day’s Europa League fi­nal.</p>
    <p>But they will be in the Cham­pi­ons League next sea­son and hav­ing fin­ished fourth in La Liga, doubts re­main that they can go on a deep run in Euro­pean foot­ball’s pre­mier com­pe­ti­tion.</p>
    <p>Span­ish coaches like Guardi­ola are among the great­est stu­dents of the game, but they now have a new puz­zle to solve – how to match teams who have pressed their topflight clubs out of Europe.</p>
