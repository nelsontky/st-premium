    <p>The in­clu­sion of Sin­ga­pore’s hawker cul­ture on the Unesco Rep­re­sen­ta­tive List of the In­tan­gi­ble Cul­tural Her­itage of Hu­man­ity on Dec 16 is truly a cel­e­bra­tion of an im­por­tant as­pect of our life­style.</p>
    <p>Hawker cen­tres are spe­cial places for fam­ily eat-outs, wa­ter­ing holes for friendly gath­er­ings and re­lax­ing spa­ces for com­mu­nity bond­ing over the com­fort food we love.</p>
    <p>In wel­com­ing the Unesco an­nounce­ment, Min­is­ter for Sus­tain­abil­ity and the En­vi­ron­ment Grace Fu re­ferred to Sin­ga­pore’s cul­tural achieve­ment as “some­thing to an­chor our na­tional iden­tity with”. More im­por­tantly, she saw it as “a call for all Sin­ga­pore­ans to step for­ward, to help us pro­mote, sus­tain this cul­ture”.</p>
    <p>She added: “They can also help us keep the place clean after they have used the place be­cause we do want this place to be one we are proud of.”</p>
    <p>But therein lies the rub. We are re­minded to keep hawker cen­tres clean and as places we can be proud of not just for us, but also for our friends here and from abroad.</p>
    <p>So let’s take stock of our state of clean­li­ness, most no­tably these two as­pects: our ef­forts to ha­bit­u­ate the cul­ture of tray re­turn, and the state of our hawker cen­tre public toi­lets.</p>
    <p>Tray re­turn</p>
    <p>The re­turn-your-tray ini­tia­tive was first rolled out in 2013 and up­dated again this year. But after seven years of nudg­ing, most hawker cen­tre pa­trons still do not prac­tise re­turn­ing their trays.</p>
    <p>In a July re­port, the Na­tional En­vi­ron­ment Agency (NEA) ex­pressed dis­ap­point­ment that only about 60 per cent of diners com­plied with the SG Clean Am­bas­sadors’ ad­vice to re­turn their trays and used crock­ery, and prop­erly dis­pose of their used tis­sues or wet wipes.</p>
    <p>Most of us are used to find­ing dirty ta­bles and floors at hawker cen­tres.</p>
    <p>In an ar­ti­cle on the Sin­ga­pore Kind­ness Move­ment’s web­site, The Pride, we asked a per­ti­nent ques­tion: “How many times have you found a ta­ble at a hawker cen­tre... only to be greeted with the sight of chicken bones and used tis­sues on dirty plates?”</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to the Sin­ga­pore Man­age­ment Univer­sity’s (SMU) Public Clean­li­ness Sat­is­fac­tion Sur­vey 2019, 36 per cent of re­spon­dents were not sure whether they should re­turn their trays. About the same per­cent­age ex­pected the clean­ers to re­turn the trays for them. The re­sult is slower turn­around of clean­ing, lead­ing to messy ta­bles, which at­tract birds and re­pel pa­trons.</p>
    <p>The com­mon ar­gu­ment is that clean­ers may lose their jobs if we re­turn our trays. But re­turn­ing our trays does not de­prive them of their jobs. In­stead, do­ing so lets them fo­cus on other ar­eas to clean and al­lows for faster turn­around of ta­bles.</p>
    <p>Toi­let habits</p>
    <p>Over the years, the state of clean­li­ness of our public toi­lets has not im­proved and has be­come much worse. Our public toi­lets have re­gressed to a dirt­ier state than they were in 2016.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to Water­loo, an SMU study of more than 1,000 toi­lets in 104 out of 114 hawker cen­tres across Sin­ga­pore re­leased in May this year, toi­lets failed to pass muster in the most ba­sic re­quire­ment of clean­li­ness.</p>
    <p>As part of the study, 8,278 cus­tomers and hawk­ers were in­ter­viewed. When asked about toi­lets in hawker cen­tres, more than a quar­ter of 5,994 pa­trons said they would not use the toi­lets there, with more than six in 10 stress­ing the need to do some­thing about the filthy state of toi­lets.</p>
    <p>The study also found that although al­most all (97 per cent) of the hawk­ers use the toi­lets at the cen­tres where they worked, most ex­pressed the need for their “mod­er­ate” to “com­plete over­haul”.</p>
    <p>More im­por­tantly, what too many of us fail to re­alise is that these hawk­ers who han­dle our food are also the most fre­quent users of these toi­lets.</p>
    <p>Note that the NEA launched its Public Toi­let Clean­li­ness ini­tia­tive in June and a Toi­let Im­prove­ment Pro­gramme in Oc­to­ber, where cof­fee shop op­er­a­tors can ap­ply to get up to 90 per cent fund­ing from the agency to im­prove their toi­lets. This shows that the results of SMU’s sur­vey and study have not fallen on deaf ears, but more still needs to be done.</p>
    <p>A man­age­ment is­sue?</p>
    <p>In shop­ping cen­tres, clean toi­lets are es­sen­tial in re­tain­ing foot traf­fic, and the man­age­ment en­sures that toi­lets are prop­erly man­aged and cleaned.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to the NEA, gen­eral clean­ing of the com­mon ar­eas and toi­lets of hawker cen­tres owned by the Min­istry of Sus­tain­abil­ity and the En­vi­ron­ment (MSE) is car­ried out by clean­ing con­trac­tors en­gaged by the NEA.</p>
    <p>Hawker cen­tres owned by the Hous­ing Board are main­tained by clean­ing con­trac­tors en­gaged by the re­spec­tive town coun­cils.</p>
    <p>Toi­lets at NEA-run hawker cen­tres are mostly free for public us­age. How­ever, some cen­tres man­aged by the town coun­cils usu­ally charge a fee for peo­ple to use the toi­lets, which are cleaned not by pro­fes­sional clean­ers but of­ten by the el­derly, hired by the town coun­cils.</p>
    <p>So un­like toi­lets in malls, hawker cen­tre toi­let man­age­ment in­volves mul­ti­ple stake­hold­ers, in­clud­ing the NEA, MSE, HDB and the re­spec­tive town coun­cils.</p>
    <p>When it comes to stan­dards of clean­li­ness, there are in place reg­u­la­tions and en­force­ment ac­tions, such as im­pos­ing com­po­si­tion fines when toi­let op­er­a­tors fail to meet hy­giene stan­dards.</p>
    <p>An NEA spokesman said in re­sponse to queries: “NEA en­sures high stan­dards of clean­ing for toi­lets in MSE-owned hawker cen­tres through spec­i­fi­ca­tions in our clean­ing con­tracts and con­tracts with NEA-ap­pointed op­er­a­tors.</p>
    <p>“For toi­lets in HDB-owned cen­tres, NEA en­gages and en­cour­ages the town coun­cils to do the same.”</p>
    <p>In view of the Covid-19 situation, NEA also is­sued a San­i­ta­tion and Hy­giene Ad­vi­sory for</p>
    <p>Mar­kets and Hawker Cen­tres on the good safe man­age­ment and clean­ing prac­tices, which in­clude toi­let clean­ing and main­te­nance.</p>
    <p>De­spite all these stan­dards and ad­vi­sories, we know, from anec­dotes and Water­loo’s results, that the state of public toi­lets still leaves much to be de­sired.</p>
    <p>So why do we still see dirty toi­lets? The an­swer lies in there be­ing var­i­ous stake­hold­ers for the hawker cen­tres, with dif­fer­ent stan­dards of clean­li­ness.</p>
    <p>Cul­ture of clean­li­ness</p>
    <p>So, how can we cre­ate a cul­ture of clean­li­ness to make our hawker cen­tres some­thing we can be proud of?</p>
    <p>First, let’s stop this neg­a­tive ap­proach of blam­ing users. This just re­in­forces the stereo­type of Sin­ga­pore­ans as ir­re­spon­si­ble and de­serv­ing of be­ing rep­ri­manded. Nam­ing and sham­ing have not worked.</p>
    <p>Sec­ond, let’s ride on the wave of na­tional pride from the Unesco recog­ni­tion by con­sciously in­still­ing in all stake­hold­ers – from the stall­hold­ers to pa­trons – a col­lec­tive ex­pec­ta­tion of good hy­giene and clean­li­ness in hawker cen­tres.</p>
    <p>Third, let’s find a way to trans­late the Unesco hon­our into some­thing tan­gi­ble – hawker cen­tres with a high stan­dard of clean­li­ness for all to en­joy.</p>
    <p>There is no magic bul­let in these sug­ges­tions, but we hope they will help our pol­i­cy­mak­ers pri­ori­tise the need to make clean­li­ness part of our cul­tural her­itage too.</p>
