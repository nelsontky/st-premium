    <p>The lead­er­ship and man­age­ment of Malay/Mus­lim or­gan­i­sa­tions will now be split up be­tween sev­eral po­lit­i­cal of­fice-hold­ers.</p>
    <p>Min­is­ter-in-charge of Mus­lim Af­fairs Masa­gos Zulk­i­fli, speak­ing on the side­lines of a vir­tual di­a­logue ses­sion yes­ter­day, said the de­ci­sion to divvy up re­spon­si­bil­i­ties was made with the en­dorse­ment of Prime Min­is­ter Lee Hsien Loong.</p>
    <p>Un­der the new ar­range­ment, Se­nior Min­is­ter of State for De­fence and Man­power Zaqy Mo­hamad will over­see Men­daki, and Par­lia­men­tary Sec­re­tary for Health Ra­hayu</p>
    <p>Mahzam will lead the de­vel­op­ment of the Malay Heritage Cen­tre.</p>
    <p>Speak­ing to the me­dia at Wisma Gey­lang Serai, Mr Masa­gos, Min­is­ter for So­cial and Fam­ily De­vel­op­ment, said: “I’m very proud of my Malay/ Mus­lim col­leagues who are of­fice­hold­ers. All of us are given many fields of re­spon­si­bil­i­ties, in­clud­ing ed­u­ca­tion, health, so­cial de­vel­op­ment, in­ter­nal se­cu­rity, de­fence...</p>
    <p>“At the same time, many of them are also hold­ing very se­nior po­si­tions and, there­fore, they are more than ca­pa­ble of shar­ing the re­spon­si­bil­i­ties that tra­di­tion­ally the Min­is­ter for Mus­lim Af­fairs holds.”</p>
    <p>Mr Masa­gos ear­lier took part in a di­a­logue with more than 170 ac­tivists from Malay/Mus­lim or­gan­i­sa­tions. It was the first of three vir­tual di­a­logue ses­sions or­gan­ised by M3 to dis­cuss key themes in Pres­i­dent Hal­imah Ya­cob’s ad­dress at the open­ing of the 14th Par­lia­ment.</p>
    <p>Mr Masa­gos said he will con­tinue to over­see the Is­lamic Re­li­gious Coun­cil of Sin­ga­pore (Muis) and de­velop the re­li­gious sec­tor, which is nec­es­sary for so­cial har­mony and pro­vid­ing guid­ance to the Malay/ Mus­lim com­mu­nity.</p>
    <p>He also high­lighted the need for re­li­gious guid­ance to be rel­e­vant to Sin­ga­pore’s con­text.</p>
    <p>Dr Ma­liki Os­man, Min­is­ter in the Prime Min­is­ter’s Of­fice and Sec­ond Min­is­ter for Ed­u­ca­tion and For­eign</p>
    <p>Af­fairs, will be ad­viser to the Peo­ple’s As­so­ci­a­tion Malay Ac­tiv­ity Ex­ec­u­tive Com­mit­tees Coun­cil (PA Mesra), the PA arm that fo­cuses on the Malay com­mu­nity.</p>
    <p>At the same time, he will over­see the M3 pro­gramme – a tie-up be­tween Men­daki, Muis and PA Mesra – which is now run­ning in eight towns. He will also be in charge of Gey­lang Serai’s re­vi­tal­i­sa­tion.</p>
    <p>Said Mr Masa­gos: “For Dr Ma­liki, he’s an old hand. He has been in politics longer than me, and I al­ways con­sult him on many is­sues.”</p>
    <p>Min­is­ter of State for Home Af­fairs and Na­tional De­vel­op­ment Faishal Ibrahim will over­see Wisma Gey­lang Serai, which Mr Masa­gos called</p>
    <p>“the nerve cen­tre of our heritage, as well as the com­mer­cial node and nexus where Malay/Mus­lims go to, es­pe­cially dur­ing Hari Raya”.</p>
    <p>Ms Ra­hayu will be ad­viser to the Malay Heritage Cen­tre, while Mayor of South East Dis­trict Fahmi Ali­man will lead the for­ma­tion of a new M3 ini­tia­tive in Gey­lang Serai.</p>
    <p>Said Mr Masa­gos: “I have given them clear di­rec­tions on where each of them should be head­ing, and how we all align. But I also hope that they will in­no­vate and be cre­ative in im­ple­ment­ing the so­lu­tions or the prob­lem-solv­ing work that they need to do.”</p>
