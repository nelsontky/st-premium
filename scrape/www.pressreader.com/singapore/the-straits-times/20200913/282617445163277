    <p>Just seven months ago, you would have been lucky to get a seat at most of the food out­lets in Raf­fles Place dur­ing lunch on a week­day.</p>
    <p>Now, you see more empty seats than peo­ple.</p>
    <p>While eater­ies in other ar­eas are once again fill­ing up with the grad­ual re­open­ing of the econ­omy, those in the Cen­tral Business Dis­trict (CBD) are not see­ing any light at the end of the tun­nel.</p>
    <p>This is be­cause many work­ers in the area are still work­ing from home.</p>
    <p>Ca­sual food and bev­er­age out­lets in the CBD tell The Sun­day Times that business is still only a small frac­tion of what it used to be be­fore the pan­demic. Most are lo­cated on the lower floors of of­fice tow­ers and, be­fore the pan­demic, catered to the throngs of work­ers out to grab a quick lunch.</p>
    <p>While rental waivers and the Gov­ern­ment’s Jobs Sup­port Scheme (JSS) have helped most of the eater­ies stay open th­ese past few months, business own­ers are wor­ried now that the as­sis­tance is be­ing scaled back.</p>
    <p>The scheme, which sub­sidises the salaries of lo­cal em­ploy­ees, has been ex­tended to March next year, but the amount will be low­ered to 30 per cent from 50 per cent pre­vi­ously.</p>
    <p>Rental re­lief is also ex­pected to be cut back pro­gres­sively. Rental is a ma­jor con­cern as it can start at $15,000 a month for a 1,000 sq ft space in the Raf­fles Place area.</p>
    <p>Mr David Che­ung, 50, is not ex­pect­ing things to get bet­ter any time soon. He and his wife, Ms Denmy Lam, 47, own The Sand­wich</p>
    <p>Shop chain, which has out­lets in the CBD and business parks, as well as The Salad Shop.</p>
    <p>They used to have 10 out­lets, but closed two sand­wich branches and a salad shop last month.</p>
    <p>Their first Sand­wich Shop out­let in Robin­son Road, which opened 18 years ago, is also clos­ing this week be­cause the lease is up. This leaves the cou­ple with five Sand­wich Shop out­lets and one Salad Shop.</p>
    <p>Mr Che­ung says when they re­opened the out­lets af­ter the cir­cuit breaker in June, business for the first few weeks was down by 90 per cent, com­pared with be­fore the pan­demic. In the past two weeks, it has picked up by about 10 per cent.</p>
    <p>He had about 100 em­ploy­ees – about 70 are Sin­ga­porean – at the be­gin­ning of the year. But only 25 will be left by the end of this month, as al­most all his for­eign staff have been laid off in the last two months.</p>
    <p>He says: “I’m get­ting des­per­ate, but there is noth­ing much I can do. Ours is a grab-and-go con­cept that needs vol­ume.</p>
    <p>“And even though some com­pa­nies are get­ting their staff to re­turn to the of­fice this month, I haven’t seen much im­prove­ment in my business. Our food ap­peals to ex­pa­tri­ates, many of whom are still work­ing from home.”</p>
    <p>He tried work­ing with de­liv­ery plat­forms, but found the take-up rate to be dis­mal.</p>
    <p>“Ours is just not one of those de­liv­ery foods you would or­der, be­cause a sand­wich is some­thing you can make at home,” he says. “Peo­ple work­ing from home would eat some­thing they can get in their neigh­bour­hood.”</p>
    <p>He says it is not easy for them to pivot to a dif­fer­ent con­cept ei­ther. “We can’t sud­denly switch to serv­ing bistro food be­cause we are not equipped to do that. Be­sides, we’re called The Sand­wich Shop, so we can’t jus­tify serv­ing spaghetti or fried rice.”</p>
    <p>Ms Lam adds that they are fo­cus­ing on how to get out of their leases with­out for­feit­ing their de­posits. More­over, they had re­newed the lease of their big­gest out­let at In­come@Raf­fles only re­cently.</p>
    <p>Their main hope, the cou­ple say, lies in peo­ple go­ing back to work in the CBD, though they ac­knowl­edge it will likely not hap­pen soon.</p>
    <p>In the mean­time, they hope rental re­lief can be struc­tured ac­cord­ing to lo­ca­tion, so that CBD eater­ies get more as­sis­tance than those in ar­eas where business has picked up.</p>
    <p>Rental costs are also weigh­ing on the mind of Mr Mark Ng, 38, who owns 16 shops in­clud­ing cof­fee chain Lo­cal Cof­fee Peo­ple, The Wolf rice-bowl and cof­fee chain, and Saigon Rolls, which sells Viet­namese rolls, sal­ads and sand­wiches.</p>
    <p>He opened all his out­lets in the CBD as he felt it would be eas­ier to at­tract staff, since they open only five days a week.</p>
    <p>But his business plum­meted by 95 per cent when the pan­demic wors­ened in Sin­ga­pore in March and has since re­cov­ered by only about 20 to 30 per cent.</p>
    <p>He closed one cof­fee out­let last month and has not been pay­ing rent since March, even though his rental waiver was only from April to July, as man­dated by the Gov­ern­ment. He has been ig­nor­ing re­minders from his land­lords.</p>
    <p>“But I have to pay even­tu­ally,” he adds. “Some land­lords have been un­der­stand­ing, but oth­ers re­fused to meet me to work it out.”</p>
    <p>Mr Ng, who started his business 11 years ago sell­ing just cof­fee and tea, now has about 30 em­ploy­ees – down from more than 80 be­fore. Many left on their own, he says.</p>
    <p>An­other F&B owner who has been de­fault­ing on rent pay­ments is Mr Waye Tan, 39, who runs The Herbal Bar, which sells tra­di­tional Chi­nese herbal soups at the base­ment of Repub­lic Plaza.</p>
    <p>He says he has not paid his land­lord since April, even though he has been re­ceiv­ing in­voices for ser­vic­ing and mis­cel­la­neous charges.</p>
    <p>Mr Tan’s business part­ner, Mr Hugh Kwan, 45, says the ten­ants met and de­cided on the course of ac­tion to­gether.</p>
    <p>By re­ly­ing on the JSS and by not pay­ing rent, they are able to keep the business op­er­a­tional, he adds. “But if we pay rent, we won’t be able to pay salaries.”</p>
    <p>The Herbal Bar’s business plunged by 90 per cent in March. The worst day was April 7, when the cir­cuit breaker pe­riod started and the shop toted up only $60 in sales that day. It was a Tues­day – a work day.</p>
    <p>Mr Tan says they used to sell up to 300 bowls of soup a day, but now con­sider them­selves lucky to sell 50.</p>
    <p>Business has not picked up with peo­ple re­turn­ing to work in phase two, he notes, be­cause most of them are younger work­ers who are not their main clien­tele. Their herbal soups ap­peal to an older crowd.</p>
    <p>De­liv­ery or­ders did not make up the dif­fer­ence ei­ther, even though they re­ceived some or­ders dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker pe­riod when dine-in was not al­lowed – mostly from friends who wanted to sup­port them.</p>
    <p>Mr Tan has lost two of his five work­ers, both Malaysians. One re­turned home ear­lier and the other was let go last month af­ter the own­ers found him a job with an­other eatery.</p>
    <p>The part­ners are liv­ing each day as it comes. Mr Kwan says: “We’ll con­tinue as long as we can. But if we’re pushed to the wall, we will just have to close and for­feit our de­posit with the land­lord.”</p>
