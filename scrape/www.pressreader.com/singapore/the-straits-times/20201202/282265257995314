    <p>•</p>
    <p>Busi­ness in­for­ma­tion provider S&P Global agreed on Mon­day to pay US$44 bil­lion (S$59 bil­lion) in stock to ac­quire IHS Markit in the year’s big­gest ac­qui­si­tion, which will cre­ate a new data pow­er­house serv­ing Wall Street and the cor­po­rate world.</p>
    <p>The deal raises the stakes in the con­sol­i­da­tion sweep­ing the frag­mented fi­nan­cial in­for­ma­tion ser­vices in­dus­try, as com­pa­nies race to cre­ate one-stop shops to lure the big­gest clients and in­vest in ar­ti­fi­cial in­tel­li­gence.</p>
    <p>The agree­ment comes af­ter Lon­don Stock Ex­change Group’s US$27 bil­lion deal last year to ac­quire fi­nan­cial data provider Refini­tiv from buy­out firm Black­stone Group and Thom­son Reuters, the par­ent of Reuters News.</p>
    <p>It puts pres­sure on ri­vals such as Bloomberg, In­tercon­ti­nen­tal Ex­change, Fac­tSet Re­search Sys­tems and Moody’s to pur­sue sim­i­lar moves.</p>
    <p>Not all of them pro­vide the same fi­nan­cial data, yet most of them chase the same clients, from in­vest­ment bankers and traders to cor­po­rate ex­ec­u­tives and trea­sur­ers.</p>
    <p>The com­bi­na­tion of S&P Global and IHS Markit is bound to be re­viewed ex­ten­sively by an­titrust reg­u­la­tors, given the scru­tiny that the Lon­don Stock Ex­change’s ac­qui­si­tion of Refini­tiv at­tracted, es­pe­cially from the Euro­pean Union.</p>
    <p>S&P Global and IHS Markit said their busi­nesses had very lim­ited over­lap, and that they ex­pected they would have the nec­es­sary reg­u­la­tory ap­provals to com­plete the deal in the se­cond half of next year.</p>
    <p>S&P Global is a dis­tant No. 3 by an­nual rev­enue, behind Bloomberg and Refini­tiv, ac­cord­ing to mar­ket re­search firm Bur­ton-Tay­lor. While the ac­qui­si­tion of IHS Markit, the No. 8 player, would not change that rank­ing, it would ac­cel­er­ate S&P Global’s growth.</p>
    <p>“Scale mat­ters be­cause you can get more vol­ume through the same op­er­a­tional set. More cus­tomers, more prod­ucts, more in­no­va­tion,” said S&P Global chief ex­ec­u­tive Dou­glas Peter­son.</p>
    <p>The deal will com­bine S&P Global’s credit rat­ings, mar­ket in­tel­li­gence busi­nesses and stock and en­ergy bench­marks with IHS Markit’s fixed in­come bench­marks and in­dices, bond pric­ing and ref­er­ence data, and in­for­ma­tion on the nat­u­ral re­sources, au­to­mo­tive and en­gi­neer­ing sec­tors. It will en­able the dis­tri­bu­tion of IHS Markit prod­ucts and ser­vices to S&P Global’s one mil­lion desk­top users.</p>
    <p>The deal’s stock ex­change ra­tio of 0.2838 S&P Global shares for each IHS Markit share im­plies only a small pre­mium of 4.7 per cent, based on last Fri­day’s clos­ing share prices.</p>
    <p>Yet IHS shares soared 10 per cent to US$104.45 on the news, as IHS share­hold­ers, who are set to own about a third of the com­bined com­pany, cheered the deal’s tar­geted an­nual cash flow syn­er­gies of US$680 mil­lion, to be achieved in five years.</p>
    <p>S&P Global shares rose 1.7 per</p>
    <p>cent to US$347.41, giv­ing the com­pany a mar­ket cap­i­tal­i­sa­tion of US$84 bil­lion.</p>
    <p>“One in­ter­est­ing as­pect is the op­por­tu­nity to cre­ate new prod­ucts from very valu­able data sets in both S&P Global’s bond is­suance and IHS Markit’s fixed in­come pric­ing and val­u­a­tion, which could re­sult in ad­di­tional rev­enue syn­er­gies out­side of the ob­vi­ous cross­selling op­por­tu­nity,” Jef­feries an­a­lysts wrote in a re­search note.</p>
    <p>The com­pa­nies said the merger will gen­er­ate an­nual free cash flow ex­ceed­ing US$5 bil­lion by 2023, al­low­ing them to in­vest over US$1 bil­lion in tech­no­log­i­cal ad­vances.</p>
    <p>S&P Global be­came a stand­alone busi­ness in 2011, when its par­ent Mc­Graw-Hill sep­a­rated it from its ed­u­ca­tion busi­ness. Lon­don-based IHS Markit was formed in 2016, when IHS, whose busi­nesses in­clude data on au­to­mo­tive and tech­nol­ogy in­dus­tries, bought Markit for around US$6 bil­lion.</p>
    <p>Both com­pa­nies have gained tens of bil­lions of dol­lars in value since then, un­der­scor­ing the fi­nan</p>
    <p>cial data sec­tor’s growth.</p>
    <p>Mr Peter­son will lead the com­bined com­pany, which will be head­quar­tered in New York, while IHS Markit CEO Lance Ug­gla will be a spe­cial ad­viser for a year af­ter the deal closes. “The next steps will be to re­ceive reg­u­la­tory ap­provals both in the US and the EU, which we ex­pect to take be­tween six and nine months, and re­ceive ap­proval by our re­spec­tive share­hold­ers,” Mr Ug­gla said in an in­ter­nal memo.</p>
    <p>A source fa­mil­iar with the mat­ter, speak­ing on con­di­tion of anonymity, said S&P Global may have to di­vest a part of IHS Markit’s “re­sources” di­vi­sion that fo­cuses on mar­ket pric­ing to se­cure reg­u­la­tory ap­provals for the deal. This in­cludes over­lap be­tween S&P Global’s en­ergy and com­modi­ties in­for­ma­tion ser­vice Platts and IHS Markit’s oil price in­for­ma­tion ser­vice Opis.</p>
    <p>The over­lap is small and any sale of parts of the Opis busi­ness would not af­fect the prof­itabil­ity of the com­pa­nies, the source added.</p>
