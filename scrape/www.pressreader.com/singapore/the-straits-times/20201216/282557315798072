    <p>TOKYO • De­mon Slayer, the tale of a boy fight­ing hu­man-eat­ing de­mons which mur­dered his fam­ily, is poised to be­come Ja­pan’s top-gross­ing film, thanks to a boost in fan num­bers due to the coron­avirus pan­demic and the movie’s mes­sage of re­silience.</p>
    <p>Based on a pop­u­lar manga and tele­vi­sion an­ime series, the film has won over fans with its nod to Ja­panese tra­di­tions peo­ple fear are miss­ing to­day.</p>
    <p>“Peo­ple in high po­si­tions act ac­cord­ing to that – ‘ no­blesse oblige’, sa­mu­rai and so on. Those at the top be­come a shield for weaker ones, us­ing their strength to pro­tect them,” said movie com­men­ta­tor Yuichi Maeda. “That’s ab­so­lutely miss­ing in mod­ern Ja­pan.”</p>
    <p>De­mon Slayer is set to over­take the Academy Award-win­ning Spir­ited Away (2001), Ja­pan’s top­gross­ing film for nearly t wo decades.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to data on Mon­day, the film – the full ti­tle of which is Kimetsu No Yaiba – Mu­gen No Ressha­hen and which was re­leased on Oct 16 – has taken in a to­tal of 30.28 bil­lion yen (S$388.2 mil­lion), within a whisker of the 30.8 bil­lion yen for Spir­ited Away, by Stu­dio Ghi­bli’s an­i­ma­tor and di­rec­tor Hayao Miyazaki.</p>
    <p>It has al­ready opened in a few Asian na­tions, in­clud­ing Sin­ga­pore, and will head to the United States and Canada early next year.</p>
    <p>The De­mon Slayer manga series, run­ning from 2016 to this year in a mag­a­zine and pub­lished in a series of books, has sold more than 100 mil­lion copies of the first 22 books.</p>
    <p>Fans lined up for the 23rd vol­ume when it went on sale ear­lier this month.</p>
    <p>Although the movie’s open­ing was pushed back due to the pan­demic, the de­lay worked to its ben­e­fit as par­ents, stuck at home dur­ing Ja­pan’s soft lock­down in spring, heard about the fran­chise from their chil­dren.</p>
    <p>With time on their hands, they read and binge-watched the series on stream­ing ser­vices.</p>
    <p>“This got the whole fam­ily in­ter­ested. It was some­thing they could talk about at home,” said Dr Yuka Ijima, an as­sis­tant pro­fes­sor at Daito Bunka Univer­sity.</p>
    <p>Dr Ijima noted that de­mons first ap­peared in Ja­panese folk­lore as a sym­bol of dis­ease and said the story’s mes­sage was res­onat­ing with au­di­ences. “Over­all, it’s about re­silience, about over­com­ing ter­ri­ble things and the strength to do that,” she said.</p>
    <p>That mes­sage is sim­i­lar to Spir­ited Away, in which a girl finds her­self on her own af­ter her par­ents are trans­formed into pigs, but with a cru­cial dif­fer­ence, said Dr Kaoru Endo, a so­ci­ol­o­gist at Gakushuin Univer­sity.</p>
    <p>“I think the mean­ing is less that we have to fight to over­come things than it is that just liv­ing is fine,” she said. “Just liv­ing through tough sit­u­a­tions is enough – and this is help­ing ev­ery­body right now.”</p>
