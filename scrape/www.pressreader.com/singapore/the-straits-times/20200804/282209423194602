    <p>WASHINGTON • The US econ­omy could ben­e­fit if the nation were to “lock down re­ally hard” for four to six weeks, a top Fed­eral Re­serve of­fi­cial said on Sun­day, adding that Congress can well af­ford l arge sums for coro­n­avirus re­lief ef­forts.</p>
    <p>The econ­omy, which in the se­cond quar­ter suf­fered its big­gest blow since the Great De­pres­sion, would be able to mount a ro­bust re­cov­ery, but only if the virus were brought un­der con­trol, Mr Neel Kashkari, pres­i­dent of the Min­neapo­lis Fed­eral Re­serve Bank, told CBS’ Face the Nation pro­gramme.</p>
    <p>“If we don’t do that and we just have this rag­ing virus spread­ing through­out the coun­try with flare­ups and lo­cal lock­downs for the next year or two, which is en­tirely pos­si­ble, we’re go­ing to see many, many more busi­ness bank­rupt­cies,” Mr Kashkari said.</p>
    <p>“That’s go­ing to be a much slower re­cov­ery for all of us.”</p>
    <p>He said Congress is po­si­tioned to spend big on coro­n­avirus re­lief ef­forts be­cause the nation’s bud­get gap can be fi­nanced with­out re­ly­ing on for­eign bor­row­ing, given how much Amer­i­cans are sav­ing.</p>
    <p>“Those of us who are for­tu­nate enough to still have our jobs, we’re sav­ing a lot more money be­cause we’re not go­ing to restau­rants or movie the­atres or va­ca­tions,” Mr Kashkari said.</p>
    <p>“That ac­tu­ally means that we have a lot more re­sources as a coun­try to sup­port those who have been laid off,” he said.</p>
    <p>The Demo­cratic-led US House of Rep­re­sen­ta­tives ap­proved a US$3 tril­lion (S$4.1 tril­lion) re­lief Bill in May, while Se­nate Repub­li­cans, many of whom have ex­pressed con­cerns about mount­ing debt, coun­tered by propos­ing a US$1 tril­lion aid pack­age last week.</p>
    <p>Ef­forts to craft a com­pro­mise ap­pear to have stalled.</p>
    <p>In an in­ter­view with ABC’s This Week pro­gramme on Sun­day, Trea­sury Sec­re­tary Steven Mnuchin said Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump would spend what was needed, but that the deficit was a fac­tor.</p>
    <p>“There’s ob­vi­ously a need to sup­port work­ers and sup­port the econ­omy,” he said. “On the other hand, we have to be care­ful about not pil­ing on enor­mous amount of debts for fu­ture gen­er­a­tions.”</p>
    <p>Mr Kashkari took a dif­fer­ent view, stress­ing both the high level of do­mes­tic sav­ing and his­tor­i­cally low in­ter­est rates.</p>
    <p>“I’m not wor­ried about it,” he said. “Congress should use this op­por­tu­nity to sup­port the Amer­i­can peo­ple and the Amer­i­can econ­omy.</p>
    <p>“If we get the econ­omy grow­ing, we will be able to pay off the debt,” Mr Kashkari added.</p>
