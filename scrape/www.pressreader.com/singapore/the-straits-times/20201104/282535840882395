    <p>• Win­ning the PGA Cham­pi­onship in Au­gust has been the high­light of Collin Morikawa’s short ca­reer but the Amer­i­can said be­ing a Ma­jor win­ner does not au­to­mat­i­cally make things eas­ier on the PGA Tour.</p>
    <p>The 23-year-old, who turned pro last year, tri­umphed at TPC Harding Park for his first Ma­jor ti­tle but has since failed to make the cut at the US Open and Shriners Hos­pi­tals for Chil­dren Open in his first two starts of the 2020-21 sea­son.</p>
    <p>Hav­ing made 22 con­sec­u­tive cuts as a pro – the sec­ond-long­est streak in the last 30 years be­hind only 15-time Ma­jor cham­pion Tiger Woods (25) – it has been quite the come­down since Au­gust.</p>
    <p>“I’ve re­alised over the last cou­ple of weeks... that this is with­out ques­tion a new PGA Tour sea­son,” Morikawa wrote in a PGA Tour blog.</p>
    <p>“I can use all those pos­i­tives that came from my break­through vic­tory at the PGA Cham­pi­onship, but that doesn’t nec­es­sar­ily mean things are au­to­mat­i­cally go­ing to come my way now.</p>
    <p>“Sure, I may be a Ma­jor win­ner now, but I still have to play good golf, and ev­ery­one out here is re­ally good at golf, too. That’s what makes the PGA Tour awe­some, is that any week any­one can win.”</p>
    <p>Morikawa, whose fa­ther is from Hawaii and is of Ja­panese de­scent, tied for 50th at last month’s Zozo Cham­pi­onship, an event he has fond mem­o­ries of, hav­ing trav­elled to Ja­pan last year to be part of the tour­na­ment’s un­veil­ing. It was moved to Cal­i­for­nia be­cause of the coro­n­avirus pan­demic but is ex­pected to re­turn to its host coun­try next year.</p>
    <p>“It was so cool go­ing to Ja­pan last year and see­ing peo­ple recognisin­g me,” he added.</p>
    <p>“I’m Amer­i­can and I fully em­brace that but it’s cool to see other peo­ple look at me – even as a role model... and use that to their in­spi­ra­tion, I hope.”</p>
    <p>He will not be part of the field at the Hous­ton Open, which starts to­mor­row and is the fi­nal PGA Tour event be­fore the year’s fi­nal Ma­jor, the Nov 12-15 Mas­ters at Au­gusta, where for­mer world No. 1 Woods is the de­fend­ing cham­pion.</p>
    <p>I may be a Ma­jor win­ner now, but I still have to play good golf, and ev­ery­one out here is re­ally good</p>
    <p>at golf, too.</p>
    <p>COLLIN MORIKAWA, Amer­i­can golfer, on hav­ing to fight hard on the Tour.</p>
