    <p>What sort of Sin­ga­porean is con­tent with the way things are?</p>
    <p>Since I bleed red and white when cut, and I have given you seven rea­sons to cel­e­brate our vi­brant food and drink scene, I want to see these seven things hap­pen in the in­dus­try:</p>
    <p>• Restau­rant pa­trons, stop be­hav­ing like jerks. If you are not turn­ing up for your book­ing, can­cel it. It is the de­cent thing to do, given the hell restau­rants have gone through. Don’t think, for one mo­ment, that they are not draw­ing up black­lists of peo­ple like you.</p>
    <p>• Hawk­ers, we have seen how cre­ative you can be in a cri­sis, how adroit. Can we make de­liv­ery a per­ma­nent fea­ture of your busi­ness?</p>
    <p>• I loved those DIY meal kits that restau­rants of­fered dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker. Paint­ing (well, as­sem­bling meals) by num­bers turned out to be fun. Make this per­ma­nent, please. I am look­ing at you, Wine Rvlt with your de­li­cious patty melt, Salted & Hung with your multi-course an­niver­sary meal that had me joy­fully en­gaged for an hour, Sum­mer Hill with your wagyu beef Proven­cal stew, and Luke’s Oys­ter Bar & Chop House with that mag­nif­i­cent English muf­fin break­fast kit.</p>
    <p>• FoodXer­vices, Clas­sic Fine Foods and other com­pa­nies that usu­ally sup­ply to food busi­nesses de­cided to sell to re­tail cus­tomers dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker. Keep at it. We want a reg­u­lar sup­ply of blue lob­sters and King Arthur Spe­cial Patent flour.</p>
    <p>• Bot­tled cock­tails soothed this sav­age breast so much dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker. I love the idea of or­der­ing drinks and lit­tle eats to en­joy at home, and now that I can have friends over, we can have us a lit­tle party. The cre­ativ­ity and qual­ity of those drinks im­pressed me. True, noth­ing beats a proper bar ex­pe­ri­ence and shoot­ing the breeze with the bar­keep. But I want bot­tled cock­tails to be here to stay.</p>
    <p>• As much as the qual­ity of in­gre­di­ents has im­proved, along with our ac­cess to them, it can be even bet­ter. When, I won­der, will I have ready ac­cess to ex­cel­lent ba­con? The su­per­mar­ket va­ri­ety is so un­der­whelm­ing. Speak­ing of su­per­mar­kets, they were cham­pi­ons through this or­deal and their sourc­ing is on fire. The se­lec­tion at Sheng Siong is stag­ger­ing. It needs to stay that way.</p>
    <p>• Open­ing a restau­rant is not al­ways a good idea. I don’t care how in­tense the rose tint on your glasses is. Think long and hard. Scru­ti­nise the lease agree­ment. Ask your­self if there is some­thing bet­ter to do with your life be­sides ac­cept­ing ra­zor-thin mar­gins and scant re­ward for your hard labour. Do you re­ally have what it takes?</p>
