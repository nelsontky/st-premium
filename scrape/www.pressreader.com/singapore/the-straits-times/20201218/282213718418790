    <p>•</p>
    <p>They were once Amer­ica’s cor­po­rate ti­tans. Beloved house­hold names. Case stud­ies in suc­cess.</p>
    <p>But now, they are in­creas­ingly look­ing like some­thing else – zom­bies. And their num­bers are swelling.</p>
    <p>From Boe­ing and Delta Air Lines to ExxonMo­bil and Macy’s, many of the coun­try’s most iconic com­pa­nies are not earn­ing enough to cover their in­ter­est ex­penses (a key cri­te­rion, as most mar­ket ex­perts de­fine it, for zom­bie sta­tus).</p>
    <p>More than 200 cor­po­ra­tions have joined the ranks of so-called zom­bie firms since the on­set of the coro­n­avirus pan­demic, ac­cord­ing to a Bloomberg anal­y­sis of fi­nan­cial data from 3,000 of the United States’ largest pub­licly traded com­pa­nies. In fact, zom­bies ac­count for nearly a quar­ter of those firms.</p>
    <p>Even more stark, they have added al­most US$1 tril­lion (S$1.3 tril­lion) of debt to their bal­ance sheets in the span, bring­ing to­tal obli­ga­tions to US$1.98 tril­lion (S$2.6 tril­lion). That’s more than the roughly US$1.58 tril­lion zom­bie com­pa­nies owed at the peak of the fi­nan­cial cri­sis.</p>
    <p>The con­se­quences for Amer­ica’s eco­nomic re­cov­ery are pro­found.</p>
    <p>The Fed­eral Re­serve’s ef­fort to stave off a rash of bank­rupt­cies by buy­ing cor­po­rate bonds might very well have pre­vented an­other de­pres­sion. But in help­ing hun­dreds of ail­ing com­pa­nies gain vir­tu­ally un­fet­tered ac­cess to credit mar­kets, pol­i­cy­mak­ers may in­ad­ver­tently be di­rect­ing the flow of cap­i­tal to un­pro­duc­tive firms, de­press­ing em­ploy­ment and growth for years to come, ac­cord­ing to econ­o­mists.</p>
    <p>“We have come to the point that we should ask, ‘What are the un­in­tended con­se­quences?’ ” said Mr Torsten Slok, chief econ­o­mist at Apollo Global Man­age­ment. “The Fed, for sta­bil­ity rea­sons, de­cided to step in. They knew they were go­ing to cre­ate zom­bies. Now the ques­tion be­comes, ‘What about the com­pa­nies that have been kept alive that oth­er­wise would have gone out of busi­ness?’ ”</p>
    <p>While zom­bie firms are more com­monly as­so­ci­ated with 1990s Ja­pan, post-cri­sis Europe or even China in re­cent years, their ranks in the US have been in­creas­ing for over a decade, fu­elled in part by years of ul­tra-loose mone­tary pol­icy.</p>
    <p>Zom­bie com­pa­nies get their nick­name be­cause of their ten­dency to limp along, un­able to earn enough to dig out from un­der their obli­ga­tions, but still with suf­fi­cient ac­cess to credit to roll over their debts. They are a drag on the econ­omy be­cause they keep as­sets tied up in com­pa­nies that can­not af­ford to in­vest and build their busi­nesses.</p>
    <p>But there are plenty of come­back sto­ries, from Bos­ton Sci­en­tific to Sprint. Many firms that have seen earn­ings wiped out due to the coro­n­avirus pan­demic are likely to re­bound once a vac­cine al­lows the global econ­omy to re­turn to a more nor­mal foot­ing and may ul­ti­mately not need all the debt they raised.</p>
    <p>Yet the sheer amount of bor­row­ing un­der­taken by strug­gling cor­po­ra­tions in re­cent months will al­most cer­tainly limit the ca­pac­ity of some to make cap­i­tal ex­pen­di­tures and adapt to shift­ing con­sumer habits as Covid-19 al­ters how Amer­i­cans spend their money.</p>
    <p>Bloomberg’s anal­y­sis looked at the trail­ing 12-month op­er­at­ing in­come of firms in the Rus­sell 3000 in­dex rel­a­tive to their in­ter­est ex­penses over the same pe­riod.</p>
    <p>Al­most a quar­ter of the in­dex, or 739 com­pa­nies, have not earned enough to meet their in­ter­est pay­ments. That com­pares with 513 firms at the end of last year. The US$1.98 tril­lion they col­lec­tively now owe dwarfs the US$1.05 tril­lion of debt zom­bie firms re­ported be­fore the pan­demic laid waste to bal­ance sheets.</p>
    <p>Boe­ing has seen its to­tal obli­ga­tions bal­loon by more than US$32 bil­lion this year, while Car­ni­val’s debt bur­den has in­creased by US$14.8 bil­lion, Delta has added US$24.2 bil­lion, Exxon US$16.2 bil­lion, and Macy’s US$1.2 bil­lion, ac­cord­ing to data com­piled by Bloomberg.</p>
    <p>“Zom­bie firms have been build­ing due to lax mar­kets that pro­vided stay­ing power for seem­ingly in­sol­vent com­pa­nies... From an eco­nomic the­ory stand­point, zom­bies lower long-term growth as you have mis­al­lo­ca­tion of cap­i­tal and com­pa­nies com­mand­ing mar­ket share but with­out the abil­ity to in­vest in growth,” said Mr Noel He­bert, Bloomberg’s di­rec­tor of credit re­search.</p>
    <p>A spokesman for Boe­ing cited the com­pany’s third-quar­ter earn­ings call, in which chief fi­nan­cial of­fi­cer Greg Smith said man­ag­ing liq­uid­ity and bal­ance sheet lever­age are top pri­or­i­ties.</p>
    <p>Rep­re­sen­ta­tives from Car­ni­val and Delta de­clined to com­ment.</p>
    <p>Exxon re­ferred Bloomberg to com­ments last month from se­nior vice-pres­i­dent Andy Swiger in which he high­lighted the oil pro­ducer’s ef­forts to re­duce op­er­at­ing ex­penses and in­crease di­vest­ments while keep­ing gross debt lev­els sta­ble.</p>
    <p>A spokesman for Macy’s said the com­pany ex­pects to have suf­fi­cient liq­uid­ity to fund op­er­a­tions and re­tire debt ma­tu­ri­ties due in the com­ing years.</p>
    <p>Among new en­trants, all four ma­jor US air­lines, with a com­bined US$128 bil­lion of debt, have be­come zom­bies this year. And en­ter­tain­ment com­pa­nies on the list grew from six last year to 12, ac­count­ing for about US$13 bil­lion of ad­di­tional debt.</p>
    <p>“We dis­tin­guish be­tween the walk­ing wounded and the walk­ing dead,” said Mr Ken Mon­aghan, a port­fo­lio man­ager at Amundi Pi­o­neer, which over­sees about US$85 bil­lion.</p>
    <p>“The ques­tion is whether the busi­ness model has changed so sig­nif­i­cantly as a re­sult of the pan­demic that sur­vival comes into ques­tion. Few sec­tors are likely to die, but some may re­quire a rad­i­cal trans­for­ma­tion to sur­vive and at­tract cap­i­tal.”</p>
    <p>Econ­o­mists have long warned that zom­bies are less pro­duc­tive, spend less on phys­i­cal and in­tan­gi­ble cap­i­tal, and grow less in terms of em­ploy­ment and as­sets than their peers.</p>
    <p>But new re­search from the Bank for In­ter­na­tional Set­tle­ments (BIS) shows that zom­bies may be even more dam­ag­ing to an econ­omy than pre­vi­ously thought.</p>
    <p>Not only are firms stay­ing in a zom­bie state for longer than in years past, but of the roughly 60 per cent of firms that do man­age to ul­ti­mately exit zom­bie sta­tus, many nonethe­less ex­pe­ri­ence pro­longed weak­ness in pro­duc­tiv­ity, prof­itabil­ity and growth, lead­ing to long-term un­der­per­for­mance.</p>
    <p>More­over, re­cov­ered firms are three times more likely to be­come zom­bies again com­pared with firms that have never been one, ac­cord­ing to the Septem­ber study, which ex­am­ined com­pa­nies in 14 ad­vanced economies over three decades.</p>
    <p>“The zom­bie disease seems to cause long-term dam­age also on those that re­cover from it,” the BIS’ Ryan Ban­er­jee and Boris Hof­mann wrote in the re­port.</p>
    <p>There­fore, “a firm’s vi­a­bil­ity should be an im­por­tant cri­te­rion for its el­i­gi­bil­ity for gov­ern­ment and cen­tral bank sup­port”.</p>
    <p>Some say the con­cern over zom­bie com­pa­nies is be­ing over­hyped.</p>
    <p>While they ac­counted for 41 per cent of US firms in a UBS Group anal­y­sis based on their in­ter­est cov­er­age ra­tios as of the sec­ond quar­ter, weighted by as­sets the per­cent­age de­clined dra­mat­i­cally to just 10 per cent.</p>
    <p>Mr Matthew Mish, a strate­gist at UBS, said: “I don’t think the prob­lem looks any worse than the last two re­ces­sions.”</p>
    <p>UN­IN­TENDED CON­SE­QUENCES</p>
    <p>The Fed, for sta­bil­ity rea­sons, de­cided to step in. They knew they were go­ing to cre­ate zom­bies. Now the ques­tion be­comes, ‘What about the com­pa­nies that have been kept alive that oth­er­wise would have gone out of busi­ness?’</p>

    <p>NOT A MA­JOR IS­SUE</p>
