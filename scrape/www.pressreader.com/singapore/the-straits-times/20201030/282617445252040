    <p>Uefa has re­peated its “strong op­po­si­tion” to a Euro­pean Su­per League, af­ter the con­tro­ver­sial project re­ceived a sur­prise shot in the arm from Josep Maria Bar­tomeu as he stood down as Barcelona pres­i­dent.</p>
    <p>In a res­ig­na­tion bomb­shell on Tues­day, he de­clared that one of his last acts as the Cata­lan team’s chief had been to ac­cept a pro­posal for Barcelona to play in “a fu­ture Euro­pean Su­per League” which would “guar­an­tee the fi­nan­cial sta­bil­ity of the club”.</p>
    <p>The no­tion of a splin­ter league for the con­ti­nent’s high rollers first sur­faced through a series of leaked e-mails and doc­u­ments in Novem­ber 2018, claim­ing that a host of Europe’s big­gest clubs were work­ing on plans for a 16-team Su­per League to kick off as early as next year.</p>
    <p>The idea was re­jected by Uefa de­bunk­ing any no­tions of a break­away league. pres­i­dent Alek­sander Ce­ferin in Fe­bru­ary last year, vow­ing “there will be no Su­per League” while he and An­drea Agnelli, pres­i­dent of the Euro­pean Club As­so­ci­a­tion, were in of­fice.</p>
    <p>Re­spond­ing to Bar­tomeu’s Tues­day night ad­mis­sion, Uefa said Ce­ferin “has clearly in­di­cated on sev­eral oc­ca­sions Uefa is strongly op­posed to a Su­per League”.</p>
    <p>Any Su­per League in­volv­ing only Europe’s wealth­i­est clubs would be in di­rect con­flict with the Uefa-run Cham­pi­ons League and Europa League, com­pe­ti­tions open to teams based on their do­mes­tic league per­for­mances.</p>
    <p>“The prin­ci­ples of sol­i­dar­ity, pro­mo­tion, rel­e­ga­tion and of open leagues are non-ne­go­tiable,” Uefa said.</p>
    <p>“This is what is be­hind Euro­pean foot­ball and makes the Cham­pi­ons League the best sport­ing com­pe­ti­tion in the world.”</p>
    <p>Euro­pean foot­ball’s rul­ing body said it re­fused to “de­stroy” its crown jewel, point­ing out that “a su­per league of 10, 12 or even 24 clubs” with the risk of out­siders crash­ing the party would be­come “in­evitably bor­ing”.</p>
    <p>Last week Fifa pres­i­dent Gianni In­fantino also de­nied his pur­ported sup­port of a Su­per League, telling a Swiss news­pa­per that “I’m in­ter­ested in the Club World Cup, not a su­per league”.</p>
    <p>The prin­ci­ples of sol­i­dar­ity, pro­mo­tion, rel­e­ga­tion and of open leagues are non-ne­go­tiable.</p>
