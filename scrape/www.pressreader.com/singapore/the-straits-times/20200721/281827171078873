    <p>HONG KONG • Prom­i­nent Hong Kong democ­racy ac­tivist Joshua Wong ap­plied yes­ter­day to run for a seat in the Chi­nese-ruled city’s leg­is­la­ture, rais­ing the prospect of a bat­tle with the author­i­ties af­ter be­ing barred from run­ning in pre­vi­ous polls.</p>
    <p>Mr Wong is one of more than a dozen young, more con­fronta­tional politi­cians who out­shone old guard democrats in un­of­fi­cial op­po­si­tion pri­maries this month in what many saw as a protest vote against a na­tional se­cu­rity law im­posed by Beijing.</p>
    <p>The Sept 6 vote will see the demo­cratic op­po­si­tion try to re­claim some po­lit­i­cal in­flu­ence in a city assem­bly stacked with Beijing loy­al­ists. Only half its seats are di­rectly elected.</p>
    <p>Po­lit­i­cal an­a­lysts and democ­racy ac­tivists ex­pect the author­i­ties will try to dis­qual­ify some can­di­dates.</p>
    <p>Beijing says the pri­maries were il­le­gal and may have vi­o­lated the se­cu­rity law, which pun­ishes what China broadly de­fines as se­ces­sion, sub­ver­sion, ter­ror­ism and col­lu­sion with for­eign forces with up to life in prison.</p>
    <p>“With the pos­si­bil­ity of fac­ing a life sen­tence... I still hope to re­ceive peo­ple’s man­date and let the world know that we will con­tinue to fight un­til our last breath,” Mr Wong, who sees him­self as a prime tar­get of the new law, told re­porters.</p>
    <p>In the past four years, the author­i­ties have barred 18 democrats, in­clud­ing Mr Wong, from run­ning in lo­cal elec­tions, ac­cord­ing to the group Civil Rights Ob­server.</p>
    <p>Mr Wong, who was 17 when he be­came the face of the 2014 stu­den­tled Um­brella Move­ment protests, has not been a lead­ing fig­ure of the of­ten vi­o­lent protests that shook the fi­nan­cial hub last year.</p>
    <p>How­ever, he has drummed up sup­port for the pro-democ­racy move­ment abroad, meet­ing politi­cians from the United States, Europe and else­where, drawing the wrath of Beijing, which says he is a “black hand” of for­eign forces.</p>
    <p>He was dis­qual­i­fied from run­ning in the ter­ri­tory’s district coun­cil elec­tions last year on the grounds that ad­vo­cat­ing for Hong Kong’s self-de­ter­mi­na­tion vi­o­lated elec­toral law.</p>
    <p>Mr Wong has said he sup­ports the idea of a non-bind­ing ref­er­en­dum for peo­ple to have a say over Hong Kong’s fu­ture but that he is against in­de­pen­dence.</p>
    <p>Mr Wong did not sign a form in which can­di­dates are asked to pledge al­le­giance to Hong Kong and its mini-Con­sti­tu­tion, the Ba­sic Law.</p>
    <p>The form is not manda­tory, but can­di­dates are re­quired by the se­cu­rity law to pledge al­le­giance in writ­ing or through other means.</p>
