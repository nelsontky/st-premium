    <p>OR­LANDO • On Kobe Bryant Day, the Los An­ge­les Lak­ers felt their for­mer great’s pres­ence and hon­oured his mem­ory with a 135-115 win over the Port­land Trail Blaz­ers to take a 3-1 lead in their Na­tional Bas­ket­ball As­so­ci­a­tion (NBA) Western Con­fer­ence first-round se­ries.</p>
    <p>In the first quar­ter on Monday, the Lak­ers es­tab­lished a 24-8 lead – Bryant’s two play­ing num­bers.</p>
    <p>LeBron James paid spe­cial at­ten­tion to the score­board be­fore help­ing Los An­ge­les com­plete a wireto-wire vic­tory.</p>
    <p>“I was like OK, he’s here in the build­ing,” said the star for­ward.</p>
    <p>“I am proud of my team, the way we played. I am ex­tremely blessed and hon­oured to con­tinue to re­mem­ber Kobe Bryant and Gigi Bryant and all the fallen peo­ple who were part of that tragic in­ci­dent.”</p>
    <p>The Lak­ers wore spe­cial black and yel­low-trimmed “Black Mamba” jer­seys to re­mem­ber Bryant who died, along with his daugh­ter and seven oth­ers, in a he­li­copter crash seven months ago. Last Sun­day would have marked his 42nd birth­day.</p>
    <p>The Lak­ers led 80-51 at the half at the Walt Dis­ney World Com­plex near Or­lando. It was the most points in a half for Los An­ge­les in a play-off game since 1987.</p>
    <p>James fin­ished with 30 points on 10-of-12 shoot­ing, 10 as­sists and six re­bounds in just 28 min­utes.</p>
    <p>Kyle Kuzma scored 18 points and Danny Green added 14 as the Lak­ers dom­i­nated. They shot 56.3 per cent from the field, in­clud­ing 17 of 39 from three-point range. And their 25 fast-break points were the most by a team in the play-offs since Bryant’s Lak­ers had 25 in Game 2 of the 2001 NBA Fi­nals.</p>
    <p>“The emo­tional as­pect did feel dif­fer­ent than any other game we played since we’ve been in the bub­ble,” Lak­ers coach Frank Vo­gel said.</p>
    <p>“To have a game on 8/24, Kobe</p>
    <p>TRIB­UTE TO KOBE</p>
    <p>I was like OK, he’s here in the build­ing. I am proud of my team, the way we played. I am ex­tremely blessed and hon­oured to con­tinue to re­mem­ber Kobe Bryant and Gigi Bryant and all the fallen peo­ple who were part of that tragic in­ci­dent. ’’</p>
    <p>LEBRON JAMES , LA Lak­ers for­ward, on the team’s 24-8 first-quar­ter lead, the late great’s two play­ing num­bers, to com­mem­o­rate Kobe Bryant Day.</p>
    <p>Bryant Day, all of us in our whole or­gan­i­sa­tion, but par­tic­u­larly our play­ers, felt that and car­ried that emo­tion onto the play­ing court.”</p>
    <p>An­thony Davis tal­lied 18 points, five re­bounds and five as­sists be­fore leav­ing the con­test in the third quar­ter with back spasms.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to Spec­trum Sport­sNet, Davis said he will be “100 per cent go­ing to be ready” for Game 5 today, when the Lak­ers can clinch the be­stof-seven se­ries with a win.</p>
    <p>Port­land star Damian Lil­lard, av­er­ag­ing 28.7 points in the se­ries be­fore Monday, also ex­ited in the third quar­ter with a right knee in­jury.</p>
    <p>He was al­ready nurs­ing a dis­lo­cated fin­ger and fin­ished with just 11 points in 27 min­utes.</p>
    <p>The guard un­der­went an MRI af­ter the game and was set to take a sec­ond test yes­ter­day. He re­mains a doubt for today’s clash.</p>
    <p>Jusuf Nur­kic de­liv­ered 20 points and 13 re­bounds and C.J. Mc­Col­lum, play­ing with a frac­tured ver­te­bra in his lower back, scored 18 for the Trail Blaz­ers.</p>
    <p>“Not good,” Blaz­ers coach Terry Stotts said of his team’s po­si­tion.</p>
    <p>“You’re down 1-3, it’s a tough po­si­tion against a good team.</p>
    <p>“We’ll re­group, it’s one game at a time. You can break out all the cliches, but we know what we’re up against when you’re down to a good team 3-1, so we’ve got to bat­tle.”</p>
