    <p>Ng Jian Xuan deftly shoots a soft foot­ball into a corner of the liv­ing room over and over, while his two younger broth­ers, aged six and three, play nearby.</p>
    <p>To his par­ents, sim­ply see­ing their el­dest child kick­ing a foot­ball is some­thing they could not have imag­ined eight years ago.</p>
    <p>Born at 24 weeks, he weighed merely 729g.</p>
    <p>“I was quite heart­bro­ken be­cause my baby was so small. You never imag­ine that your baby would be this size,” says his mother, Ms Wong Yen Hong, 36, of the first time she and her hus­band saw him in the neona­tal in­ten­sive care unit at the Na­tional Univer­sity Hos­pi­tal (NUH).</p>
    <p>Af­ter about four months in the neona­tal in­ten­sive care unit, he had grown big enough to be taken home, but the fam­ily had a chal­leng­ing first year of par­ent­hood.</p>
    <p>As pre­ma­ture ba­bies are some­times known to stop breath­ing be­cause their lungs are im­ma­ture, the cou­ple kept a con­stant vigil in the early months, check­ing on him while he slept de­spite hav­ing a baby mon­i­tor.</p>
    <p>The many vis­its to the doc­tor were tax­ing, but be­cause of th­ese reg­u­lar checks, they found out that Jian Xuan has mild hear­ing loss and can­not hear sounds be­low 30 to 40 deci­bels.</p>
    <p>“Our hearts sank a bit,” says his fa­ther, Mr Ter­ence Ng, 39, an engi­neer­ing man­ager.</p>
    <p>They grap­pled with the rec­om­men­da­tion to give their baby a hear­ing aid be­fore he turned one. “He’s still a baby, still de­vel­op­ing, maybe af­ter one year, he might be fine,” Ms Wong, a hu­man re­source man­ager, re­calls won­der­ing then.</p>
    <p>Fol­low­ing the NUH ex­perts’ ad­vice proved ben­e­fi­cial, though, as Jian Xuan im­proved un­der reg­u­lar speech ther­apy ses­sions.</p>
    <p>The Ngs en­rolled him in an Early In­ter­ven­tion Pro­gramme for</p>
    <p>In­fants and Chil­dren Cen­tre run by Thye Hua Kwan Moral Char­i­ties, in ad­di­tion to reg­u­lar pre-school.</p>
    <p>To­day, the en­er­getic Pri­mary 2 boy at­tends Canos­sian Pri­mary, a main­stream school that caters to kids with hear­ing loss.</p>
    <p>He takes two sub­jects – English and math­e­mat­ics – and de­lighted his par­ents by com­ing in third in the school’s re­cent math­e­mat­ics cham­pi­onship.</p>
    <p>“To us, it’s a bonus be­cause, ob­vi­ously, we want him to be healthy – that’s the main thing,” Mr Ng says.</p>
    <p>The cou­ple say a strong sup­port sys­tem of med­i­cal ex­perts, fam­ily, friends and col­leagues is im­por­tant for par­ents of pre­emies.</p>
    <p>Ms Wong’s for­mer boss, for in­stance, al­lowed her to pump breast milk at work ev­ery three hours and rush to the hos­pi­tal ev­ery day to de­liver it to her son while he was in the neona­tal in­ten­sive care unit.</p>
    <p>Such cheer­lead­ers gave the cou­ple strength and hope through the ups and downs of their jour­ney that “things will even­tu­ally work out”, says Ms Wong.</p>
    <p>Shar­ing their story is their way of show­ing other par­ents in the same predica­ment that “it’s not all gloomy, it’s not the end of the world”, Mr Ng says.</p>
    <p>“There are a lot of things you can look for­ward to.”</p>
