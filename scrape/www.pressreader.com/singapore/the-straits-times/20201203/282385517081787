    <p>More events need to be staged in South-east Asia if the re­gion is to raise the pro­file of cy­cling, says 2011 Tour de France cham­pion Cadel Evans.</p>
    <p>“Events are the first step, hav­ing rides and races peo­ple can par­tic­i­pate in to get a feel for the sport,” the Aus­tralian told The Straits Times in a re­cent e-mail in­ter­view.</p>
    <p>“A na­tion’s cy­cling al­most al­ways starts with a small but very pas­sion­ate fol­low­ing that is grown through ei­ther par­tic­i­pa­tion and/or in­spi­ra­tion by a na­tion’s ath­letic en­deav­ours.”</p>
    <p>While the re­gion has pro­duced track world cham­pi­ons, such as Malaysia’s Az­izul­hasni Awang, who won gold in the men’s keirin at the 2017 Union Cy­cliste In­ter­na­tionale (UCI) Track Cy­cling World Cham­pi­onships, the UCI Road World Cham­pi­onships have been dom­i­nated by Euro­peans.</p>
    <p>Evans, 43, said: “His­tor­i­cally, Asian rid­ers have had more suc­cess on the track and in moun­tain bike, but that may only be be­cause of the un­der­de­vel­op­ment of lo­cal and re­gional road rac­ing. I like to think that we can change this in the fu­ture.”</p>
    <p>He was the first Aus­tralian to win the UCI ProTour (2007) and the UCI Road World Cham­pi­onships in 2009.</p>
    <p>Af­ter fin­ish­ing sec­ond in the 2007 and 2008 editions of the Tour de France, Evans be­came the first Aus­tralian to cap­ture the cov­eted ti­tle in 2011.</p>
    <p>An ex­am­ple of an event that can help raise the pro­file of the sport in the re­gion is the Coupe de Hue in Viet­nam.</p>
    <p>Evans said the race, which made its de­but in 2018, is a great event for rid­ers of all ages to test them­selves against the best in the re­gion. It is a two-day, two-stage road race that can in­volve up to 3,100m of climb­ing over 155km.</p>
    <p>Evans, an am­bas­sador of the event, was in­vited to par­tic­i­pate last year and said he was “blown away” by the ex­pe­ri­ence.</p>
    <p>Stage 1 com­prises an av­er­age gra­di­ent of 8.3 per cent for 15.2km, while the Stage 2 Gran Fondo con­sists of a ride of ei­ther 70km or 140km.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­porean Dione Wang, who fin­ished sec­ond in the women’s race in Viet­nam last year, said the event taught her a lot.</p>
    <p>The 27-year-old, who was there with her club mata­dorRac­ing, said: “The race suited me be­cause I’m not a sprinter. I pre­fer to go up­hill so the first stage was per­fect for me.</p>
    <p>“The sec­ond day was more chal­leng­ing be­cause there was a lot of de­scend­ing which I didn’t have too much con­fi­dence do­ing then, so I strug­gled but I em­braced the chal­lenge of it.”</p>
    <p>This year’s race was can­celled be­cause of the coro­n­avirus pan­demic but it will re­turn next year. Laura Chia</p>
