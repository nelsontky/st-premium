    <p>“I love in­ti­macy,” says Amer­i­can poet Sharon Olds.</p>
    <p>“Con­nec­tion – com­mu­ni­ca­tion. I think there is great strength and plea­sure in it. I think we need it, to lead a full life. I think our souls hunger for it.”</p>
    <p>The theme of this year’s Sin­ga­pore Writ­ers Fes­ti­val is in­ti­macy, and Olds, 77, is a fit­ting head­liner. Her work has long had in­ti­macy as its hall­mark, from its frank ex­plo­ration of the fe­male body and sex­u­al­ity to its lay­ing bare dif­fi­cult sub­jects like her child­hood abuse and di­vorce.</p>
    <p>“I think I would pre­vent in­ti­macy if I were try­ing to but­ter the reader up, or if I felt I were in pos­ses­sion of knowl­edge the reader might need,” she says in an e-mail in­ter­view.</p>
    <p>“In other words, if I were us­ing a poem for ul­te­rior mo­tives, I think that would get in the way of mu­tual trust be­tween writer and reader.</p>
    <p>“I guess I have faith that if I keep my fo­cus on the poem – rather than on my­self, or on some imag­i­nary reader – that I have the best chance of mak­ing some­thing which might be of some use to a reader, or give a reader some plea­sure, some com­pan­ion­ship.”</p>
    <p>Olds’ hus­band, a doc­tor, left her af­ter more than 30 years of mar­riage for an­other woman.</p>
    <p>Fif­teen years later, Olds trans­muted her emo­tions around their di­vorce into the 2012 col­lec­tion Stag’s Leap, which won both the Pulitzer and T.S. Eliot prizes, two of the most pres­ti­gious awards in the po­etry world.</p>
    <p>The po­ems of Stag’s Leap chart the di­vorce and its af­ter­math, from im­me­di­ate con­cerns such as how to break the news to her two chil­dren and mother, to the years of com­ing to terms with it, un­til she can de­scribe “the body of a war­bler/ like a whole note fallen from the sky – my old/love for him, like a song­bird’s rib cage picked clean”.</p>
    <p>Un­like many writ­ers, Olds does not mind if peo­ple read her po­ems as au­to­bi­og­ra­phy.</p>
    <p>“It makes sense,” she says, adding that she does not feel ex­posed by what she shares in her work.</p>
    <p>But she stresses: “If the story of a poem is per­sonal, or ap­par­ently per­sonal – I think that isn’t what’s most in­ter­est­ing about a poem. I think that per­sonal or not per­sonal doesn’t have to do with whether a poem works or not.</p>
    <p>“Some po­ems might feel ‘too per­sonal’ to some read­ers, oth­ers ‘not per­sonal enough’ to oth­ers. For me, these are not the most im­por­tant terms in which to talk about po­ems.”</p>
    <p>What mat­ters to her, she says, are the myr­iad fac­tors that go into mak­ing a poem come alive for the reader: pas­sion and cred­i­bil­ity; mu­sic, har­mony and dis­so­nance; rel­e­vance and orig­i­nal­ity.</p>
    <p>From the time a poem is writ­ten – usu­ally by hand with ball­point pen in a lined gro­cery-store note­book – to its suc­cess­ful fruition, she feels that it has gone over into the world of art.</p>
    <p>“I am happy if some­one likes it. But it’s not ex­actly con­nected to me, as a di­ary en­try might be. If it works as a poem, it has changed its life form.”</p>
    <p>Olds was raised in Berke­ley, Cal­i­for­nia, in a strictly re­li­gious Calvin­ist house­hold. She has writ­ten about child­hood abuse and dif­fi­cult parental re­la­tion­ships. In po­ems like The Day They Tied Me Up, she de­scribes be­ing pun­ished at the age of eight by be­ing tied to a chair.</p>
    <p>She was 37 when her first col­lec­tion, Satan Says, was pub­lished. Pre­vi­ously in the 1970s, her at­tempts to sub­mit her work to mag­a­zines met with re­jec­tions.</p>
    <p>She re­called to The Guardian how one told her: “This is a lit­er­ary mag­a­zine. If you wish to write about this sort of sub­ject, may we sug­gest the Ladies’ Home Jour­nal. The true sub­jects of po­etry are... male sub­jects, not your chil­dren.”</p>
    <p>Af­ter 14 col­lec­tions and a bevy of ac­co­lades that in­clude the La­mont Po­etry Prize and the Na­tional Book Crit­ics Cir­cle Award, it would seem that Olds has had the last laugh.</p>
    <p>Yet she never takes a poem for granted, nor its read­ers. “If any­one reads a poem we have writ­ten, we are lucky,” she says.</p>
    <p>She is now busy com­pil­ing two manuscript­s from po­ems writ­ten be­tween 2016 and this year, one for a col­lec­tion called Bal­lads, the other for a book of love po­ems.</p>
    <p>She aims to present these to her ed­i­tor next year, though she says she is still hav­ing a hard time whit­tling down her se­lec­tion.</p>
    <p>“I am among the po­ets who en­joy writ­ing, but some days, it’s im­pos­si­ble to write a poem we like and be­lieve in,” she says.</p>
    <p>“I write a lot of po­ems and most of them, no one ever sees – they’re just not good enough... they don’t live enough.</p>
    <p>“I think the en­ergy of a work of art can trans­mute an ex­pe­ri­ence, or a per­cep­tion, a feel­ing, a scene, into art – can record, or trans­form, can ‘stop in time’ a par­tic­u­lar mo­ment, or hour, a day or year – and when that hap­pens, there is joy there, there is the beauty of truth, maybe the truth of grief or de­spair or joy.”</p>
    <p>She adds self-dep­re­cat­ingly: “But, as I say, I can’t do that very of­ten.”</p>
    <p>I guess I have faith that if I keep my fo­cus on the poem – rather than on my­self, or on some imag­i­nary reader – that I have the best chance of mak­ing some­thing which might be of some use to a reader, or give a reader some plea­sure, some com­pan­ion­ship.</p>
