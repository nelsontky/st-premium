    <p>LON­DON • Rafael Nadal has in­sisted he can still win the ATP Fi­nals for the first time de­spite a dam­ag­ing 7-6 (9-7), 7-6 (7-4) de­feat by Do­minic Thiem on Tues­day.</p>
    <p>The Aus­trian be­came the first player to qual­ify for the semi-fi­nals, while the Spa­niard, who is bid­ding to fi­nally lift the one ma­jor prize miss­ing from his packed tro­phy cabi­net, must beat reign­ing ATP Fi­nals cham­pion Ste­fanos Tsit­si­pas to­day to join him.</p>
    <p>The sixth-seeded Greek elim­i­nated Rus­sian sev­enth seed An­drey Rublev 6-1, 4-6, 7-6 (8-6) to set up a win­ner-takes-all Lon­don 2020 group clash at a closed­door O2 Arena, but Nadal is look­ing for­ward to the chal­lenge.</p>
    <p>“I’m happy with the way I played. I think my chances are big­ger to have a very good re­sult now than five days ago be­cause the level of ten­nis, even if I lost to­day (against Thiem), for me, is much higher,” said the joint-record 20-time Grand Slam win­ner, who has a 5-1 ad­van­tage in head-to­head meet­ings with the Greek.</p>
    <p>The world No. 2 has won 86 ti­tles but just one of those has come on an in­door hard court.</p>
    <p>He has also qual­i­fied for the ATP Fi­nals for 16 years in a row, los­ing in the 2010 and 2013 fi­nals. But his record at the eight-man elite event pales in com­par­i­son with Roger Fed­erer and No­vak Djokovic after six in­jury with­drawals.</p>
    <p>Po­ten­tially fac­ing an­other dis­ap­point­ment in the sea­son fi­nale, Nadal said he could not ex­plain his</p>
    <p>Only one of Rafael Nadal’s 86 ca­reer ti­tles has come on an in­door hard court – the Madrid Open in 2005. prob­lems at the event but in­sisted there was no as­terisk against him.</p>
    <p>“I think even if I never won here, I don’t want to pre­tend to be ar­ro­gant at all, be­cause I am not,” he added. “But I re­ally don’t need to show even to my­self or to no one that if I am play­ing my best ten­nis, I think I can win in every sur­face and against any player.</p>
    <p>“I never won in the World Tour Fi­nals. That’s the real thing at the same time. I have a match against Tsit­si­pas in two days. Gonna be an­other tough one.</p>
    <p>“I hope to be ready. I think play­ing like this I am con­fi­dent that I can have my chances in the tour­na­ment.”</p>
    <p>Like Nadal, Tsit­si­pas has no in­ten­tion of go­ing home early, vow­ing to take the game to the French</p>
    <p>Open cham­pion.</p>
    <p>“I’m go­ing to try and play an ag­gres­sive game against Rafa,” he said. “You can’t be de­fen­sive. I have to start strong and fin­ish even stronger.”</p>
    <p>World No. 3 Thiem, who won the US Open in Septem­ber for his first Grand Slam ti­tle, mean­while looks to go one bet­ter than last year’s run­ner-up fin­ish.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, in the Tokyo 1970 group, 2018 ATP Fi­nals cham­pion Alexan­der Zverev of Ger­many out­lasted Diego Schwartz­man 6-3, 4-6, 6-3 to elim­i­nate the Ar­gen­tinian and kept his own hopes alive.</p>
