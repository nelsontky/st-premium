    <p>The Jobs Growth In­cen­tive will en­tice com­pa­nies to hire older work­ers, whose higher salary ex­pec­ta­tions are one of the big­ger chal­lenges this de­mo­graphic poses for em­ploy­ers, an­a­lysts said.</p>
    <p>But this must go to­gether with train­ing, they added.</p>
    <p>The $1 bil­lion scheme was an­nounced by Deputy Prime Min­is­ter Heng Swee Keat on Mon­day, aimed at boost­ing hir­ing of lo­cal work­ers, es­pe­cially the older ones.</p>
    <p>Firms that hire lo­cal work­ers over the next six months will re­ceive a sub­sidy of up to 25 per cent of their salar­ies for one year, sub­ject to a cap. This ap­plies to growth firms that meet the qual­i­fy­ing cri­te­ria.</p>
    <p>The co-pay­ment goes up to 50 per cent for work­ers aged 40 and above.</p>
    <p>OCBC Bank’s head of trea­sury re­search and strat­egy Se­lena Ling said: Ma­ture work­ers may face many chal­lenges, rang­ing from higher salary, pos­si­bly ob­so­lete skills, (to) lack of dig­i­tal skills, and per­cep­tions that they are less nim­ble.”</p>
    <p>She added that the co-pay­ment is “very gen­er­ous” and can be seen as giv­ing a big push for the SGUnited Jobs and Skills Pack­age, which helps to ex­pand job, trainee­ship and skills train­ing op­por­tu­ni­ties for Sin­ga­pore­ans hit by the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Na­tional Univer­sity of Sin­ga­pore Busi­ness School as­so­ciate pro­fes­sor Lawrence Loh said the co-pay­ment will also tilt the bal­ance for many com­pa­nies towards em­ploy­ing older work­ers, who are of­ten dis­ad­van­taged in the job hunt.</p>
    <p>“Older work­ers are price tak­ers in the j ob mar­ket now, es­pe­cially amid the pan­demic cri­sis. Their pre­vi­ous jobs will have higher salar­ies and if these lev­els are ex­pected in the new job sit­u­a­tions, there is cer­tainly a mis­match. The dou­ble whammy is that the high pay is cou­pled with old skills,” he said.</p>
    <p>“The co-pay­ments will hope­fully help de­fray any re­train­ing costs or even bring up the pay as close to pre­vi­ous lev­els as pos­si­ble.”</p>
    <p>May­bank Kim Eng se­nior econ­o­mist Chua Hak Bin said the in­cen­tive will also push firms to con­sider the mer­its of older work­ers more se­ri­ously, which is im­por­tant as the pop­u­la­tion ages, and a fail­ure in this re­spect can lead to a rise in struc­tural un­em­ploy­ment rates in the ma­ture pop­u­la­tion.</p>
    <p>“There is a risk that firms may re­trench older work­ers be­cause their pay is likely higher than younger re­cruits’. Older work­ers may also be more set in their ways and less will­ing to switch roles if the firm has to change di­rec­tion, par­tic­u­larly towards adopt­ing new tech­nol­ogy.”</p>
    <p>These same fac­tors could hin­der them from get­ting hired.</p>
    <p>So, be­sides in­cen­tives, the work­ers also have to play their part, Mr Chua said. “Train­ing and reskilling will help, but a mind­set change might also be re­quired on the part of the older work­ers.”</p>
    <p>Com­pa­nies that are hir­ing said the new scheme is en­cour­ag­ing in sup­port­ing their ef­forts, es­pe­cially towards ma­ture work­ers.</p>
    <p>Hair care firm Bei­jing 101 Hair Con­sul­tants, which has al­most 20 job open­ings, said the in­cen­tive can also re­duce man­power costs, es­pe­cially if the ma­ture worker needs more time to pick up the re­quired skills.</p>
    <p>Its human re­source man­ager Coco Lim said: “We have ma­ture work­ers in dif­fer­ent roles like hair ther­a­pist, cus­tomer ser­vice of­fi­cer and road­show pro­moter, for ex­am­ple, so it is very much de­pen­dent on what the ma­ture work­ers want and their will­ing­ness to learn.”</p>
    <p>Mr Im­ran Bus­ta­mam, group head of human re­sources at lo­gis­tics firm Ninja Van, said: “We do not dis­crim­i­nate when hir­ing, and have sev­eral older em­ploy­ees in var­i­ous roles across the or­gan­i­sa­tion. All staff across all lev­els of the or­gan­i­sa­tion are of­fered train­ing and devel­op­ment ini­tia­tives.” It has about 100 po­si­tions open now.</p>
    <p>A DBS Bank spokesman said: “DBS is com­mit­ted to help­ing more ma­ture work­ers adapt to the new nor­mal and en­cour­ag­ing em­ploy­ees to em­brace con­tin­u­ous growth and devel­op­ment in their ca­reer jour­ney. We have in place proac­tive pro­fes­sional con­ver­sion pro­grammes to help equip em­ploy­ees with the skills and com­pe­ten­cies to be fu­ture-ready.”</p>
    <p>Ear­lier, DBS an­nounced it in­tends to hire over 2,000 peo­ple in Sin­ga­pore this year.</p>
    <p>It is also reskilling em­ploy­ees across de­part­ments in eight job roles rang­ing from back-end bank­ing op­er­a­tions to client-fac­ing ones, to help staff gain the nec­es­sary knowl­edge and com­pe­ten­cies to take on new or en­hanced roles.</p>
    <p>Older work­ers are price tak­ers in the job mar­ket now, es­pe­cially amid the pan­demic cri­sis. Their pre­vi­ous jobs will have higher salar­ies and if these lev­els are ex­pected in the new job sit­u­a­tions, there is cer­tainly a mis­match.</p>
    <p>The dou­ble whammy is that the high pay is cou­pled with old skills. The co-pay­ments will hope­fully help de­fray any re­train­ing costs or even bring up the pay as close to pre­vi­ous lev­els as pos­si­ble.</p>
