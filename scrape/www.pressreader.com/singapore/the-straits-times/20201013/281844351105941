    <p>•</p>
    <p>Demon­stra­tors in Thai­land call­ing for re­form of the monar­chy plan to sur­round the Prime Min­is­ter’s of­fice to­mor­row and openly defy King Maha Va­ji­ra­longkorn, said a key leader of the protests.</p>
    <p>The gath­er­ing will start in an area near the Grand Palace and con­clude with a march to Gov­ern­ment House, the main of­fice of Prime Min­is­ter Prayut Chan-o-cha, ac­cord­ing to Mr Parit Chi­warak, one of the or­gan­is­ers who wrote a 10-point de­mand call­ing for re­form of the monar­chy. He said pro­test­ers plan to camp out around the com­plex un­til the week­end.</p>
    <p>“We’re es­ca­lat­ing our move­ment – the goal would be to sur­round the Gov­ern­ment House,” Mr Parit said, adding that he ex­pects it to be their big­gest de­mon­stra­tion yet.</p>
    <p>He said he does not ex­pect the gov­ern­ment to use force to dis­perse pro­test­ers be­cause that would be “the end for them”.</p>
    <p>The protest will take place on a route King Va­ji­ra­longkorn is ex­pected to use to at­tend a sched­uled event nearby. Mr Parit said the pro­test­ers will give the royal mo­tor­cade a three-fin­ger salute – a sym­bol of the es­ca­lat­ing protest move­ment, which at­tracted about 50,000 peo­ple at a rally last month.</p>
    <p>The pro­test­ers have called for the res­ig­na­tion of Mr Prayut and his mil­i­tary-backed gov­ern­ment, and a rewrit­ing of the Con­sti­tu­tion drafted af­ter a 2014 coup he led that helped him stay in power fol­low­ing elec­tions last year.</p>
    <p>They are also seek­ing to rein in some powers of the monar­chy, such as pro­hibit­ing the king from en­dors­ing any coup and re­vok­ing re­stric­tive laws that crim­i­nalise in­sults against top mem­bers of the royal fam­ily.</p>
    <p>“I’d like to ask all cit­i­zens to main­tain peace and or­der as much as pos­si­ble, to re­spect the law and to not get in the way of other peo­ple,” Mr Prayut said at a brief­ing yes­ter­day, with­out di­rectly men­tion­ing the planned protest.</p>
    <p>Deputy Premier Prawit Wong­suwan, who over­sees se­cu­rity af­fairs, yes­ter­day said the gov­ern­ment has pre­pared for the planned protest. He also said he does not ex­pect a large num­ber of demon­stra­tors and is still open to a dis­cus­sion with the group, which has re­jected talks with him.</p>
    <p>School and univer­sity stu­dents, labour groups and the move­ment’s sup­port­ers out­side Bangkok are ex­pected to be at the protest, Mr Parit said.</p>
