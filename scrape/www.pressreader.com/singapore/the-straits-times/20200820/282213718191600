    <p>The mood around the globe might have im­proved in re­cent days, but that failed to lift sen­ti­ment among lo­cal in­vestors.</p>
    <p>While many traders were fo­cus­ing on the record highs on Wall Street overnight, sour­ing re­la­tions be­tween China and the United States re­mained on the radar.</p>
    <p>The lat­est salvo out of Wash­ing­ton came in the form of a warn­ing to col­leges and uni­ver­si­ties to sell any Chi­nese hold­ings in their en­dow­ments ow­ing to pro­posed rules that could see the firms delisted.</p>
    <p>US Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump said on Tues­day that he post­poned trade talks with China orig­i­nally sched­uled for last week­end, adding that he “(doesn’t) want to talk to China right now”.</p>
    <p>The un­cer­tainty left the Straits Times I ndex (STI) down 2.05 points, or 0.08 per cent, at 2,561.04, with losers out­num­ber­ing gain­ers 248 to 171 on trade of 1.85 bil­lion shares worth $1.12 bil­lion.</p>
    <p>Wil­mar In­ter­na­tional was the top gainer, up 1.89 per cent to $4.86. The agri-busi­ness group is listed as one of RHB’s top buys. It noted that Wil­mar’s “di­ver­si­fied busi­ness with ex­po­sure to con­sumer-pack prod­ucts helps to off­set weak­ness in other busi­nesses”, and that the po­ten­tial ini­tial public of­fer­ing of Yi­hai Kerry Arawana – Wil­mar In­ter­na­tional’s Chi­nese unit – “by end-2020 is a key cat­a­lyst”.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore Air­lines was at the bot­tom of the STI’s per­for­mance ta­ble, de­clin­ing 2.69 per cent to $3.62. This comes as the group said on Tues­day that trav­ellers from nine new cities can now tran­sit through</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore. It is also in­creas­ing the fre­quency of se­lected ser­vices in its pas­sen­ger net­work over the next three months.</p>
    <p>Asian mar­kets sim­i­larly bucked the trend of the Wall Street rally.</p>
    <p>The Jakarta Com­pos­ite In­dex dipped 0.42 per cent, while the bench­mark Shang­hai Com­pos­ite dropped 1.24 per cent as China-US trade ten­sions con­tinue to es­ca­late.</p>
    <p>The Hang Seng In­dex eased 0.74 per cent, with trad­ing can­celled in the morn­ing ow­ing to a strong ty­phoon in the city.</p>
    <p>But Ja­pan’s Nikkei 225 In­dex ended its two-day de­cline and rose 0.26 per cent.</p>
    <p>In­vestors search­ing for fresh cat­a­lysts to risk as­sets are keep­ing watch on US fis­cal stim­u­lus talks and wait­ing for the Fed­eral Re­serve to re­lease min­utes of a July com­mit­tee meet­ing, which may give clues about in­fla­tion tar­get­ing.</p>
    <p>“We have a Fed­eral Re­serve that is all in, keep­ing rates low prob­a­bly across the curve for as far as the eye can see,” Ms Katie Nixon, chief in­vest­ment of­fi­cer at North­ern Trust Wealth Man­age­ment, told Bloomberg TV. “That is sup­port­ive of higher val­u­a­tions.”</p>
