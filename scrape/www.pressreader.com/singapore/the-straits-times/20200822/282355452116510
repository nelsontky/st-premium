    <p>• The Los An­ge­les Lakers and Mil­wau­kee Bucks stepped it up on Thurs­day, bounc­ing back from open­ing up­sets with con­vinc­ing vic­to­ries in the National Bas­ket­ball As­so­ci­a­tion (NBA) first-round play-offs.</p>
    <p>Le­Bron James and the Lakers, seeded first in the West­ern Con­fer­ence stand­ings, thumped the Portland Trail Blaz­ers 111-88 to even their best-of-seven se­ries at one game apiece.</p>
    <p>An­thony Davis, who strug­gled through an eight-of-24 shoot­ing night in their Game 1 loss, led Los An­ge­les with 31 points on 13-of-21 shoot­ing and pulled down 11 boards in 29 min­utes at Dis­ney World.</p>
    <p>The All-Star for­ward be­came the first Laker since Ka­reem Ab­dul-Jab­bar to score more than 30 points in a play-off game in less than 30 min­utes of ac­tion to off­set an un­char­ac­ter­is­ti­cally quiet night for James, who had just 10 points.</p>
    <p>On Davis, the three-time NBA cham­pion said: “He was just ag­gres­sive from the be­gin­ning of the game. He wasn’t pas­sive at all, looked for his shots. He did a great job of re­bound­ing as well, got some put­backs.</p>
    <p>“We knew we had to not have as many de­fen­sive lapses. When you have a de­fen­sive strat­egy, you have to ex­e­cute that strat­egy for 48 min­utes and I think we did a great job of that tonight.”</p>
    <p>The Lakers held the Blaz­ers to 40 per cent shoot­ing over­all and just 27.6 per cent from be­yond the arc, although Portland’s shoot­ing woes were ex­ac­er­bated by Damian Lil­lard leav­ing the court with less than two min­utes re­main­ing in the third quar­ter.</p>
    <p>The All-Star guard dis­lo­cated his left in­dex fin­ger – ap­par­ently when he banged his hand against Davis’ foot while reach­ing for the ball – and failed to re­turn for the fourth quar­ter.</p>
    <p>Lil­lard, who torched the Lakers for 34 points in Game 1, fin­ished with 18.</p>
    <p>While he in­sisted that he would start in Game 3 to­day, say­ing his hand was “just sore”, his in­jury comes as a se­vere blow to the Blaz­ers, who need him at his best if they are to up­set the cham­pi­onship con­tenders.</p>
    <p>Portland’s star player was named the best player of the restart, av­er­ag­ing 37.6 points and 9.6 as­sists in eight seed­ing games.</p>
    <p>In the Eastern Con­fer­ence, the league’s reign­ing Most Valu­able Player Gian­nis An­te­tok­oun­mpo led the Bucks with 28 points and 20 re­bounds as Mil­wau­kee brought the de­fen­sive in­ten­sity that car­ried them to the NBA’s best reg­u­lar-sea­son record.</p>
    <p>The ti­tle con­tenders came back from a hum­bling loss in Game 1 to beat the Or­lando Magic 111-96, in which they out­re­bounded their op­po­nents 57-42 and held them to with­out a point in the paint for the first quar­ter.</p>
    <p>“Our whole mind­set dur­ing this game was to come out, play hard, play to­gether, and as long as we got stops, we were go­ing to fig­ure it out on of­fence,” the All-Star for­ward said. “I think the team did a great job first quar­ter, set­ting the tone. Com­ing out hard, play­ing hard, re­bound­ing the ball and just mak­ing the right play.”</p>
    <p>Cen­tre Brook Lopez, who con­trib­uted 20 points, added: “The ef­fort was def­i­nitely an ‘A’. Game 1 they came in and they out­worked us, that’s not some­thing we can al­low.”</p>
    <p>Else­where, the Hous­ton Rock­ets and Mi­ami Heat both took 2-0 leads in their se­ries, beat­ing the Ok­la­homa City Thun­der 111-98 and the In­di­ana Pac­ers 109-100 re­spec­tively.</p>
