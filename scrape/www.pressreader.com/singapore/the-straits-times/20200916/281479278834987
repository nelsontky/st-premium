    <p>Sin­ga­pore Post is ad­just­ing its de­liv­ery rates for parcels and pack­ages to stream­line its ser­vices and of­fer more com­pet­i­tive prices ahead of the hol­i­day peak sea­son.</p>
    <p>The new pric­ing struc­ture, which takes ef­fect on Oct 15, will com­prise flat rates and lower prices for most domestic de­liv­ery ser­vices.</p>
    <p>In­ter­na­tional postal rates for pack­ages will also be sim­pli­fied and made cheaper for most cus­tomers, SingPost said in a state­ment yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Ba­sic pack­ages, which are small items de­liv­ered to the let­ter­box, are cur­rently priced at be­tween 90 cents and $3.50, de­pend­ing on weight.</p>
    <p>From Oct 15, all pack­ages up to 2kg – the max­i­mum for let­ter­box de­liv­er­ies – will cost a flat $1.50.</p>
    <p>This means that heav­ier items will be cheaper to post, while items weigh­ing be­tween 100g and 250g will cost more.</p>
    <p>Those who opt for track­ing will pay $3, down from the current range of $3.20 to $4.80.</p>
    <p>Postage-paid en­velopes, such as poly mail­ers and SmartPac pack­ag­ing, will also have their rates re­vised down.</p>
    <p>All ba­sic de­liv­ery pack­ages will be de­liv­ered to the let­ter­box within two work­ing days, down from the current ser­vice stan­dard of three work­ing days, SingPost said.</p>
    <p>There are also changes to lo­cal de­liv­ery ser­vices by courier arm Speed­post, which of­fers doorstep de­liv­ery.</p>
    <p>The domestic Speed­post Econ­omy ser­vice, which of­fers de­liv­ery in two work­ing days, will be dis­con­tin­ued.</p>
    <p>This is be­cause next-day de­liv­ery ser­vice Speed­post Stan­dard will have its rates cut from be­tween $10 and $16 to a flat $6 for items weigh</p>
    <p>ing up to 30kg. There will be no changes to the Speed­post Ex­press ser­vice, which of­fers two-hour de­liv­ery for be­tween $15 and $25.</p>
    <p>SingPost spokesman Robin Goh said the faster ser­vice and lower prices that Speed­post will of­fer are due to in­vest­ments in tech­nol­ogy and bet­ter de­liv­ery pro­duc­tiv­ity.</p>
    <p>“As we im­prove the way we work, we have am­ple ca­pac­ity to take on more par­cel de­liv­er­ies do­mes­ti­cally,” he said.</p>
    <p>For in­ter­na­tional de­liv­er­ies, the Speed­post Stan­dard op­tion – which of­fers par­cel de­liv­ery in five to 14 days – will cease.</p>
    <p>This leaves only the faster Ex­press and Pri­or­ity op­tions or the slower Econ­omy route, de­liv­ered by sea.</p>
    <p>While in­ter­na­tional pack­age de­liv­er­ies will l argely be cheaper, some will cost more, de­pend­ing on weight and des­ti­na­tion.</p>
    <p>A reg­is­tered pack­age sent to Aus­tralia, for ex­am­ple, will cost $21.10 for 500g, up from $20.60 now.</p>
    <p>This is be­cause of higher ter­mi­nal dues paid to over­seas postal agen</p>
    <p>cies for the last-mile de­liv­ery of items and the sig­nif­i­cant in­crease in air freight charges in re­cent years, Mr Goh said.</p>
    <p>There are no changes to air­mail and aero­gramme rates.</p>
    <p>The ad­just­ments come amid a surge in e-com­merce vol­umes and in an­tic­i­pa­tion of the year-end peak sea­son, SingPost said.</p>
    <p>SingPost last re­vised its rates and ser­vices last year, when new cat­e­gories for de­liv­ery of pack­ages to the let­ter­box were in­tro­duced.</p>
    <p>Mr Vin­cent Phang, Sin­ga­pore head and chief ex­ec­u­tive of postal ser­vices at SingPost, said there has been a strong take-up for both the ba­sic and tracked pack­age op­tions, which do not rely on re­cip­i­ents be­ing at home for de­liv­ery.</p>
    <p>Com­pe­ti­tion in the last-mile de­liv­ery scene has been heat­ing up amid the grow­ing pop­u­lar­ity of online shop­ping, with couri­ers such as GrabEx­press of­fer­ing de­liv­ery rates start­ing at $6.</p>
