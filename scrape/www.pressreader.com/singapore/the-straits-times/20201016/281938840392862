    <p>Four men and three women, aged be­tween 23 and 54, have been ar­rested in the past week for their sus­pected in­volve­ment in the theft of Bud­get 2020 gro­cery vouch­ers from let­ter­boxes in Hous­ing Board es­tates across Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>Pre­lim­i­nary in­ves­ti­ga­tions in­di­cate that the cases are likely to be un­re­lated and op­por­tunis­tic in na­ture, said the po­lice in a state­ment yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The first sus­pect, a 37-year-old woman, was pre­vi­ously re­ported to have been ap­pre­hended on Sun­day for al­legedly steal­ing Bud­get 2020 gro­cery vouch­ers at a res­i­den­tial block in Lorong 7 Toa Payoh.</p>
    <p>Po­lice are in­ves­ti­gat­ing this case. Four oth­ers were ar­rested on</p>
    <p>Wed­nes­day.</p>
    <p>A man and woman, aged 24 and 23 re­spec­tively, will be charged in court to­day after al­legedly steal­ing vouch­ers at a res­i­den­tial block in Tampines Street 86.</p>
    <p>The man is also ex­pected to be charged over steal­ing the vouch­ers at the same lo­ca­tion on a sep­a­rate oc­ca­sion.</p>
    <p>Po­lice also ar­rested a man, 41, and a woman, 44, for the al­leged theft of the vouch­ers at a res­i­den­tial block in Mar­sil­ing Road.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, two 54-year-old men were ar­rested in sep­a­rate cases, for al­legedly steal­ing vouch­ers at flats in Telok Blan­gah Rise and in Hol­land Close.</p>
    <p>Po­lice in­ves­ti­ga­tions into these cases are on­go­ing.</p>
    <p>The po­lice have also re­ceived re­ports of sim­i­lar in­ci­dents in other res­i­den­tial es­tates and said they are “in­ten­si­fy­ing our ef­forts with a view to ap­pre­hend the per­pe­tra­tors and bring them to jus­tice”.</p>
    <p>“If you spot any sus­pi­cious peo­ple loi­ter­ing near the let­ter­boxes, please call the po­lice at 999 im­me­di­ately,” they added.</p>
    <p>Mem­bers of the pub­lic who are el­i­gi­ble for the Bud­get 2020 gro­cery vouch­ers are ad­vised to col­lect them from their let­ter­boxes as soon as pos­si­ble, and keep their let­ter­boxes se­cured at all times.</p>
    <p>Those who sus­pect their vouch­ers have been stolen should make a po­lice re­port im­me­di­ately and call the Gro­cery Voucher hotline on 1800-2222-888 to re­quest for their vouch­ers to be voided and re­placed.</p>
    <p>Voided vouch­ers can­not be re­deemed.</p>
