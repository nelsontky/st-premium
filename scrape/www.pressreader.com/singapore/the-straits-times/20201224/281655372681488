    <p>Be­fore this year, the word “quar­an­tine” was usu­ally re­served for im­ported live­stock, plants and even pets.</p>
    <p>Twelve months in, it has ex­panded into the lex­i­con of nearly ev­ery­one whose life has been touched by Covid-19.</p>
    <p>In Sin­ga­pore, it is used to re­fer to those un­der ob­ser­va­tion in gov­ern­ment fa­cil­i­ties, or on a strict home iso­la­tion regime as a re­sult of be­ing in close con­tact with some­one who has been in­fected.</p>
    <p>Far­ther afield, dif­fer­ent coun­tries have their own take on quar­an­tine, from Malaysia’s move­ment con­trol or­ders to “self-quar­an­tine” in the United States, and pos­si­bly the harsh­est of them all, to­tal lock­down in parts of China.</p>
    <p>In Jan­uary, as cases of a mys­te­ri­ous pneu­mo­nia started show­ing up in the cen­tral Chi­nese city of Wuhan, Sin­ga­pore started mon­i­tor­ing the sit­u­a­tion. The Repub­lic is the top des­ti­na­tion for trav­ellers from Wuhan, and the Spring Fes­ti­val travel sea­son was right around the cor­ner.</p>
    <p>In late Jan­uary, the Min­istry of Na­tional Devel­op­ment said quar­an­tine, or iso­la­tion, would be im­posed on peo­ple who were well but might have been ex­posed to an in­fec­tious agent – they them­selves might be in­fected, but were not yet ill.</p>
    <p>Putting them un­der quar­an­tine would pre­vent them from po­ten­tially in­fect­ing oth­ers, the min­istry said.</p>
    <p>In China, where cases had started to spike, the au­thor­i­ties or­dered a com­plete lock­down on Wuhan, a city of 11 mil­lion, and sev­eral sur­round­ing cities.</p>
    <p>Ef­fec­tively quar­an­tin­ing some 50 mil­lion peo­ple, it was the big­gest such ex­er­cise in hu­man his­tory, and it lasted 76 days.</p>
    <p>Res­i­dents were al­lowed to go out only once ev­ery two days to buy gro­ceries and es­sen­tial items, while some es­tates or­gan­ised food de­liv­er­ies. There was chaos at first, with su­per­mar­ket shelves emp­ty­ing as peo­ple rushed to stock up, while thou­sands scram­bled to leave the city.</p>
    <p>Dr Gau­den Galea, the World Health Or­gan­i­sa­tion’s rep­re­sen­ta­tive in Bei­jing, said: “The lock­down of 11 mil­lion peo­ple (in Wuhan) is un­prece­dented in pub­lic health his­tory.”</p>
    <p>The newly iden­ti­fied coro­n­avirus cre­ated alarm be­cause so lit­tle was known about it.</p>
    <p>Other coun­tries in the re­gion, where the virus was quickly spread­ing, fol­lowed with sim­i­lar moves that were slightly less dra­co­nian.</p>
    <p>In Sin­ga­pore, this man­i­fested in a cir­cuit breaker that went into ef­fect on April 7 and lasted nearly two months. Dur­ing this time, peo­ple could leave their homes only for es­sen­tial pur­poses, schools were closed, and most busi­nesses had to ei­ther work re­motely or shut.</p>
    <p>Across the world, quar­an­tines were less strictly en­forced.</p>
    <p>In much of Europe, in­clud­ing Bri­tain, there has been some form of move­ment re­stric­tion which re­duced the num­ber of cases in the sum­mer. But many coun­tries are see­ing a win­ter resur­gence.</p>
    <p>In the US, quar­an­tine has re­mained an is­sue of per­sonal choice and so­cial re­spon­si­bil­ity. Politi­cians and celebri­ties urged peo­ple to stay home in “self-quar­an­tine”.</p>
    <p>And in a year of a bit­terly fought pres­i­den­tial elec­tion, the de­ci­sion to quar­an­tine or not be­came one of po­lit­i­cal choice.</p>
    <p>Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump con­stantly mocked his op­po­nent Joe Biden for so­cial dis­tanc­ing and speak­ing from his home in Delaware, in­stead of host­ing ral­lies and meet­ing vot­ers. Mr Trump later con­tracted Covid-19.</p>
    <p>Yet, even as the dust of the elec­tion is still set­tling, the choice to quar­an­tine, so­cially dis­tance and wear a mask has been framed as a po­lit­i­cal one di­vided along party lines.</p>
    <p>Quar­an­tine is now also syn­ony­mous with in­ter­na­tional travel – most coun­tries, in­clud­ing Sin­ga­pore, re­quire trav­ellers to stay at a des­ig­nated fa­cil­ity for at least two weeks.</p>
    <p>In China, which has seen a con­sis­tent stream of mini out­breaks across the coun­try, the cap­i­tal Bei­jing has or­dered in­com­ing trav­ellers to quar­an­tine for 21 days.</p>
    <p>The ad­di­tion of at least 14 days to any travel plans has dealt a body blow to the tourism in­dus­try, which is see­ing its big­gest threat since World War II.</p>
    <p>And in­dus­try in­sid­ers are pes­simistic about what the new year might bring.</p>
    <p>Mr Song Yang, who runs a travel agency in Bei­jing, said: “Quar­an­tine is likely to con­tinue to be a big part of trav­el­ling, even with a vac­cine, be­cause the in­jec­tion only pro­tects you, but not those around you if you’re a car­rier.</p>
    <p>“The other op­tion is a ‘travel bub­ble’, but un­til coun­tries can have zero new cases, which even China can’t do, it looks bleak.”</p>
