    <p>JAKARTA • In­done­sia needs to re­con­sider the ben­e­fits it gets from be­ing part of the Asean Economic Com­mu­nity, the head of the coun­try’s in­vest­ment board said yesterday, after data showed for­eign di­rect in­vest­ment (FDI) fell for the sec­ond straight quar­ter.</p>
    <p>South-east Asia’s largest econ­omy at­tracted 97.6 tril­lion ru­piah (S$9.3 bil­lion) of FDI in April-June, ex­clud­ing in­vest­ment in bank­ing and oil and gas. This is a 6.9 per cent drop in ru­piah terms from a year ago and a roughly 3 per cent fall in US dol­lar terms, ac­cord­ing to data from In­done­sia’s in­vest­ment board, or BKPM.</p>
    <p>That fol­lowed a 9.2 per cent fall in FDI in the first quar­ter as in­vestors post­poned in­vest­ment de­ci­sions due to the coro­n­avirus pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Top sources of FDI in the sec­ond quar­ter were Sin­ga­pore, Hong Kong, China and Ja­pan.</p>
    <p>BKPM chief Bahlil La­hadalia noted that FDI from Sin­ga­pore had held up de­spite the city state post­ing a 41 per cent quar­terly drop in its gross do­mes­tic prod­uct in the sec­ond quar­ter, which he said in­di­cated its role as a hub for in­vest­ment from else­where.</p>
    <p>“We must be­gin to re­think whether the Asean Economic Com­mu­nity has ben­e­fited In­done­sia,” said Mr La­hadalia.</p>
    <p>He added that this was a ra­tio­nal de­bate and noted Bri­tain’s de­ci­sion to leave the Euro­pean Union.</p>
    <p>The Asean Economic Com­mu­nity was es­tab­lished in 2015 to in­te­grate the economies of its 10 mem­ber states.</p>
    <p>It has had a num­ber of free trade agree­ments as an economic bloc and is pur­su­ing fur­ther in­te­gra­tion in the broader economic sec­tor as well as in po­lit­i­cal se­cu­rity and so­cio­cul­tural mat­ters.</p>
    <p>Re­fer­ring to the im­pact of the pan­demic, Mr La­hadalia said he was op­ti­mistic FDI would im­prove in the sec­ond half of this year and was pray­ing for the out­break not to worsen.</p>
    <p>In the sec­ond quar­ter, in­dus­tries that re­ceived the most FDI in­cluded power, gas and wa­ter, base met­als and trans­porta­tion, ware­hous­ing and telecom­mu­ni­ca­tions.</p>
    <p>In­done­sia’s coro­n­avirus case count as of yesterday was 91,751, with 4,459 deaths. Pres­i­dent Joko Wi­dodo has said the out­break was not ex­pected to peak un­til Au­gust or Septem­ber.</p>
