    <p>Iam glad that Sin­ga­pore has ob­tained enough vac­cines for the pop­u­la­tion to be vac­ci­nated (Free, vol­un­tary vac­ci­na­tions for all S’pore­ans, long-term res­i­dents, Dec 15). It is heart­en­ing that the Health Sciences Au­thor­ity has eval­u­ated the safety of the vac­cine thor­oughly and the safety pro­file seems sat­is­fac­tory.</p>
    <p>It is also re­as­sur­ing that the safety, ef­fi­cacy and long-term side ef­fects are be­ing mon­i­tored closely by the man­u­fac­tur­ers and our own health author­i­ties.</p>
    <p>In the light of all these, it seems rea­son­able to em­bark on mass vac­ci­na­tion with­out too much anx­i­ety.</p>
    <p>It must be noted that al­ler­gic re­ac­tions can oc­cur with any vac­cine, even with vac­cines that have been in the mar­ket for a long time.</p>
    <p>The fact that some peo­ple get ad­verse re­ac­tions does not mean that it is un­wise to be vac­ci­nated.</p>
    <p>There seems to be news go­ing around that many peo­ple are not will­ing to be vac­ci­nated for fear of side ef­fects and other per­sonal rea­sons. This may act as an ob­sta­cle in the quest to con­trol the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>What needs to be stressed is that at vac­ci­na­tion cen­tres, there should be suf­fi­cient fa­cil­i­ties and trained per­son­nel to deal with ana­phy­lac­tic re­ac­tions, and sys­tems in place for the close su­per­vi­sion of peo­ple with a his­tory of al­ler­gic re­ac­tions.</p>
    <p>Also, the author­i­ties should look into the med­i­cal his­tory of peo­ple who are be­ing vac­ci­nated and check on those who have a past his­tory of al­ler­gic re­ac­tions to var­i­ous med­i­ca­tions and those who are al­ler­gic to var­i­ous things such as food and dust. For these in­di­vid­u­als, vac­ci­na­tion is still pos­si­ble but ex­tra pre­cau­tions may be nec­es­sary.</p>
    <p>If mass vac­ci­na­tion prom­ises suc­cess in con­trol­ling the pan­demic, some al­ler­gic re­ac­tions should not halt this process; in­stead, the author­i­ties should en­sure all nec­es­sary pre­cau­tions are taken to pre­vent se­vere ad­verse re­ac­tions that may take place, as with all other vac­cines.</p>
    <p>It must be noted that al­ler­gic re­ac­tions can oc­cur with any vac­cine, even with vac­cines that have been in the mar­ket for a long time.</p>
