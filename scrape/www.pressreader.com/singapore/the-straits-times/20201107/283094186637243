    <p>I don’t know where I got this or when I got it. I just know it’s mostly with me. If this scarf could talk, it would have a few sto­ries. It has been around my neck. It has been around my head. When you’ve got a bag with­out straps you’re tired of car­ry­ing, it be­comes a bag strap. It has been a belt.</p>
    <p>A few years ago, my girl­friends and I were on a Greek is­land. My friend was brave enough to get on a mo­tor­bike and drive it. She had this tiny lit­tle strappy low-back dress on and she was about to take off when I said, like your mother would: “Wait, wait, take this,” and I put it on her like a har­ness.</p>
    <p>When we were on the road, I was on the bike be­hind her and I could just see the scarf flap­ping in the breeze and it was such a beau­ti­ful colour in that sun­light. It’s one of those things that I prob­a­bly will lose one day, but I’d be very sorry to see it go.</p>
