    <p>WASH­ING­TON Sam Burns, a 24-year-old seek­ing his first PGA Tour ti­tle, used a fast start and steady fin­ish en route to a bo­geyfree five-un­der 65 to grab a twostroke lead after Fri­day’s sec­ond round of the Hous­ton Open.</p>
    <p>The Amer­i­can hit 15 of 18 greens in reg­u­la­tion on his way to stand­ing on seven-un­der 133 after 36 holes at Me­mo­rial Park, where 2,000 spec­ta­tors – the daily limit – watched un­der strict Covid-19 safety pro­to­cols.</p>
    <p>“It takes a lot of dis­ci­pline around here,” Burns said. “You get out of po­si­tion, you just try to get it back to where you can get it up and down.”</p>
    <p>Aus­tralia’s Ja­son Day, the 2015 PGA Cham­pi­onship win­ner, and Mex­ico’s Car­los Or­tiz shared sec­ond on 135 after both carded 68s.</p>
    <p>South African Dawie van der Walt (66), Canada’s Corey Con­ners (67) and Amer­i­cans Brandt Snedeker (71), Pat­ton Kizzire (67) and Aaron Wise (66) were an­other stroke adrift.</p>
    <p>World No. 179 Burns birdied three of the first four holes, then added birdies at the par-five eighth from 11 feet and 12 feet at the par-five 16th on his way to match­ing the course record.</p>
    <p>“For­tu­nately early we got some good looks and I was able to con­vert,” he said. “So solid. Look­ing for­ward to the week­end.”</p>
    <p>Burns shared sev­enth at the Safe­way Open in Septem­ber, when he had his only other PGA Tour endof-day lead after round two and learnt to be pa­tient.</p>
    <p>“Slow­ing down a lit­tle bit, re­ally talk­ing through the shot with Travis (Perkins, his cad­die) and mak­ing sure we have a clear pic­ture of what we’re try­ing to do,” Burns said. “That was re­ally help­ful to learn.”</p>
    <p>The top-ranked Dustin John­son, in his first tour­na­ment since con­tract­ing Covid-19 and miss­ing two events last month, fired a 66 to stand on 138.</p>
    <p>“Just a lit­tle rusty, but I felt like I swung it pretty well,” he said.</p>
    <p>“Drove it well, hit a lot of qual­ity shots, so very pleased with how I played. I’m just look­ing to get a lit­tle bet­ter each day. I’m happy with where I’m at.”</p>
    <p>Four-time Ma­jor win­ner Brooks Koepka, try­ing to find form after hip and knee in­juries, birdied two of the last four holes to shoot 70 and make the week­end on 142, one un­der the cut line.</p>
    <p>Five-time Ma­jor win­ner Phil Mick­el­son fired a quin­tu­ple-bo­gey eight on the ninth, his high­est ca­reer score on a par-three hole. He shot 73 to stand on 149 and missed the cut.</p>
