    <p>Pres­i­dent Xi Jin­ping touted China as the pivot point for global free trade yesterday, vow­ing to keep its “su­per-sized” econ­omy open for busi­ness and warn­ing against pro­tec­tion­ism as the world bat­tles the coro­n­avirus pandemic.</p>
    <p>Buoyed by the sign­ing of the world’s largest trade pact – the Re­gional Com­pre­hen­sive Eco­nomic Part­ner­ship (RCEP) – over the week­end, Mr Xi said the Asia-Pa­cific is the “fore­run­ner driv­ing global growth” in a world hit by “mul­ti­ple chal­lenges”.</p>
    <p>He vowed “open­ness” to trade and re­jected any pos­si­bil­ity of the</p>
    <p>“de­cou­pling” of China’s econ­omy, in his only nod to the hos­tile trade pol­icy of United States Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump’s ad­min­is­tra­tion, which has bat­tered China with tar­iffs and tech­nol­ogy re­stric­tions.</p>
    <p>Mr Xi was speak­ing at the Asia-Pa­cific Eco­nomic Co­op­er­a­tion (Apec) fo­rum – held vir­tu­ally this year due to the pandemic – which brings to­gether 21 Pa­cific Rim coun­tries, ac­count­ing for about 60 per cent of global gross do­mes­tic prod­uct.</p>
    <p>It was not im­me­di­ately clear if Mr Trump, wounded by his elec­tion loss to Mr Joe Bi­den, would take part in the two-day gath­er­ing or send a high-level del­e­gate in his place.</p>
    <p>In a speech that veered into tri­umphal­ism over China’s eco­nomic “re­silience and vi­tal­ity” in bounc­ing back from the virus, which first emerged in the cen­tral city of Wuhan, Mr Xi warned that coun­tries which in­sist on trade bar­ri­ers would suf­fer self-in­flicted wounds.</p>
    <p>“Open­ness en­ables a coun­try to move for­ward while seclu­sion holds it back,” he said.</p>
    <p>“China will ac­tively co­op­er­ate with all coun­tries, re­gions and en­ter­prises that want to do so. We will con­tinue to hold high the ban­ner of open­ness and co­op­er­a­tion.”</p>
    <p>But Mr Xi’s rhetoric may raise eye­brows in cap­i­tals where China has ei­ther re­stricted trade or used its gi­ant econ­omy as a bar­gain­ing chip in wider geopo­lit­i­cal dis­putes.</p>
    <p>Aus­tralian ex­ports of beef, wine and bar­ley to China – their big­gest mar­ket – have been re­stricted, as a diplo­matic spat over the ori­gins of the pandemic as well as ac­cu­sa­tions of es­pi­onage ham­mer re­la­tions.</p>
    <p>The Apec sum­mit comes less than a week af­ter China and 14 other Asia-Pa­cific coun­tries signed the RCEP. The agree­ment, which ex­cludes the US, is viewed as a ma­jor coup for China and fur­ther ev­i­dence that Bei­jing is set­ting the agenda for global com­merce as Washington re­treats.</p>
    <p>RCEP’s ri­val was the Trans-Pa­cific Part­ner­ship – cham­pi­oned by for­mer US pres­i­dent Barack Obama – but Mr Trump with­drew from it and the pact has now been re­placed by a wa­tered-down al­ter­na­tive that the US has not joined.</p>
    <p>Mr Xi had no di­rect words for Pres­i­dent-elect Bi­den, whose as­cen­sion to of­fice next year – while still clouded by Mr Trump’s re­fusal to con­cede de­feat – is ex­pected to see a more nu­anced ex­ten­sion of Washington’s cur­rent China pol­icy.</p>
    <p>Mr Bi­den has been stri­dent on China’s hu­man rights record, from its treat­ment of Uighur Mus­lims in the restive Xin­jiang re­gion to Hong</p>
    <p>Kong’s democ­racy move­ment.</p>
    <p>Yesterday, Malaysian Prime Min­is­ter Muhyid­din Yassin, the sum­mit’s host leader, urged Apec mem­bers to recom­mit them­selves to the group’s core goal of free and open trade and in­vest­ment.</p>
    <p>Thai Prime Min­is­ter Prayut Chan-o-cha also echoed calls to em­brace mul­ti­lat­er­al­ism while tout­ing the sign­ing of the RCEP as a piv­otal mo­ment for the re­gion.</p>
    <p>Other speak­ers in­cluded Sin­ga­pore Prime Min­is­ter Lee Hsien Loong and In­done­sian Pres­i­dent Joko Wi­dodo.</p>
