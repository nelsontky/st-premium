    <p>Work­ing from home might sound like a dream come true. But for some work­ers here, that ar­range­ment dur­ing the on­go­ing pan­demic has been a night­mare.</p>
    <p>At one con­tent mar­ket­ing firm, em­ploy­ees on work-from-home ar­range­ments are forced to fill out de­tailed time sheets on what they do ev­ery hour.</p>
    <p>The firm went as far as to warn its staff not to use the time to run per­sonal er­rands or meet friends, and jus­ti­fied the time sheets as an ex­tra tool for su­per­vi­sors to man­age their depart­ments re­motely.</p>
    <p>“It is quite dis­rup­tive, as we have to find time out­side our usual tasks to com­plete the list,” said a ju­nior man­ager at the firm.</p>
    <p>“Some­times, I would have to back­track through my e-mails and call logs to re­mem­ber ex­actly what I did in each hour.”</p>
    <p>At some firms, bosses send nonur­gent work mes­sages late at night, and ex­pect a prompt re­sponse.</p>
    <p>Oth­ers, know­ing that their work­ers were stuck at home dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker pe­riod, fre­quently dragged vir­tual meet­ings on past work hours, said em­ploy­ees on telecom­mut­ing ar­range­ments.</p>
    <p>One em­ployee at a con­sul­tancy firm said she of­ten re­ceived nonur­gent mes­sages from her su­per­vi­sor af­ter din­ner time.</p>
    <p>On some oc­ca­sions, her su­pe­rior would text the team’s group chat past mid­night seek­ing sug­ges­tions for projects.</p>
    <p>“Such mes­sages were more fre­quent dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker, be­cause she knew we couldn’t re­ally be any­where else but home,” said the em­ployee.</p>
    <p>“I would of­ten go to sleep think­ing about work.”</p>
    <p>Ob­servers said such prac­tices can bring greater stress.</p>
    <p>But they pointed out that the con­di­tions might have ex­isted long be­fore the pan­demic, such as in le­gal, ad­ver­tis­ing and au­dit­ing firms where work­ing over­time is a norm.</p>
    <p>A for­mer ac­count man­ager at an ad­ver­tis­ing firm re­called her man­age­ment im­pos­ing a fine of $2 for ev­ery minute some­one showed up late af­ter the 10am re­port­ing time, even though the staff usu­ally worked past 10pm daily.</p>
    <p>“My team had to work over­time al­most ev­ery day, some­times as late as 4am.</p>
    <p>“But no mat­ter how late we worked, we had to re­port to the of­fice ev­ery morn­ing,” she said, adding that she does not know if the agency still uses the sys­tem of fines.</p>
    <p>Peo­ple World­wide Con­sult­ing man­ag­ing direc­tor David Leong said many Asian coun­tries, in­clud­ing Sin­ga­pore, value hard work and dili­gence.</p>
    <p>How­ever, he added: “Em­ploy­ers must be cog­nisant that when work­ers break down as a re­sult of pres­sure and an op­pres­sive en­vi­ron­ment, their work per­for­mance will be im­pacted.”</p>
    <p>BLURRED BOUND­ARIES</p>
    <p>Such mes­sages were more fre­quent dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker, be­cause she (the su­per­vi­sor) knew we couldn’t re­ally be any­where else but home... I would of­ten go to sleep think­ing about work.’’</p>
