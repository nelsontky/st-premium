    <p>LOS AN­GE­LES Gian­nis An­te­tok­oun­mpo, blood­ied from a cruel el­bow blow, fin­ished with 25 points and Karl-An­thony Towns wel­comed a respite from a Covid-19 fam­ily tragedy as 14 Na­tional Bas­ket­ball As­so­ci­a­tion (NBA) teams em­barked on their first pre­sea­son games on Satur­day.</p>
    <p>Clubs are fine-tun­ing their ros­ters as vet­er­ans work on their roles and rook­ies seek to show they can con­trib­ute with the new NBA sea­son start­ing on Tues­day next week.</p>
    <p>Just un­der two months have passed since the Los An­ge­les Lakers won their 17th NBA ti­tle, mak­ing it the short­est off-sea­son in league his­tory for most teams.</p>
    <p>But for the eight teams who did not make it to the “bub­ble” in Or­lando, Florida, it has been the long­est lay-off since the 1998 labour lock­out.</p>
    <p>The Min­nesota Tim­ber­wolves were one of them and Towns (below), their All-Star cen­tre, was in tears dur­ing the pre-games cer­e­monies af­ter tak­ing to the floor for the first time since los­ing seven rel­a­tives, in­clud­ing his mother, to Covid-19.</p>
    <p>The NBA halted its sea­son in March due to the pan­demic and Towns’ mother died a month later. As the play­ers and coaches were in­tro­duced in the empty arena, he sat on the bench with his face buried in a towel and his team­mates came over to com­fort him as he wiped away tears.</p>
    <p>Towns de­liv­ered 13 points and eight re­bounds in 22 min­utes and guard D’An­gelo Rus­sell also looked im­pres­sive with a teamhigh 14 points in a 107-105 loss to the Mem­phis Griz­zlies. An­thony Ed­wards, the first over­all pick in the 2020 NBA Draft, came off the bench to score five points in 26 min­utes for Min­nesota.</p>
    <p>In the Bucks’ pre-sea­son opener, An­te­tok­oun­mpo was blood­ied by an ac­ci­den­tal el­bow to the face early in the game but it did not stop him from scor­ing a game-high 25 points in Mil­wau­kee’s 112-102 loss to the Dal­las Mav­er­icks.</p>
    <p>The two-time Most Valu­able Player (MVP), who the Bucks hope to sign to a con­tract ex­ten­sion be­fore next Mon­day’s dead­line, got stitched up be­fore re­turn­ing to the court.</p>
    <p>“I got back to the locker room and the doc­tor checked my eye,” said the “Greek Freak”. “I didn’t want to play just two min­utes and sit the rest out.”</p>
    <p>Else­where, two-time MVP Stephen Curry and the Golden State War­riors also hit the floor for the first time since the March stop­page.</p>
    <p>The league’s pre­mier shooter, who played just five games last term due to a bro­ken hand, scored 10 points and had three as­sists as his team beat the Den­ver Nuggets 107-105.</p>
