    <p>Ms Cherie Wong, 39, has not seen her fam­ily since Chi­nese New Year, and will now pay a pre­mium to spend her Christ­mas hol­i­days back home in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>The Sin­ga­porean in­te­rior de­sign man­ager, who has lived in Hong Kong since 2007, de­cided to “grit (her) teeth and pay up” for a flight after the air travel bub­ble be­tween Sin­ga­pore and Hong Kong was an­nounced last month.</p>
    <p>Un­der the in­au­gu­ral ar­range­ment, trav­ellers will be able to travel be­tween the two air hubs with­out the need for quar­an­tine, stay-home no­tice re­quire­ments or a con­trolled itin­er­ary.</p>
    <p>To fly, they just have to be in ei­ther Sin­ga­pore or Hong Kong for a 14-day pe­riod be­fore mak­ing the jour­ney and have neg­a­tive re­sults from mu­tu­ally recog­nised Covid-19 swab tests.</p>
    <p>Ms Wong said: “I still have mis­giv­ings, given that the de­tails of the air travel bub­ble are not yet clear. But at the same time, flight prices are sky­rock­et­ing.</p>
    <p>“I’m ba­si­cally tak­ing a gam­ble and lock­ing in the air tick­ets be­fore prices go too high.”</p>
    <p>The travel bub­ble is ex­pected to kick in later this month. Fares, how­ever, have al­ready surged 30 to 40 per cent.</p>
    <p>Ms Wong’s pre-booked flight back to Sin­ga­pore ear­lier in the year was can­celled and, after shift­ing it to De­cem­ber, she had to pay an ex­tra $640 for her ticket.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore Air­lines (SIA) and SilkAir cur­rently have 10 sched­uled weekly flights this month and next be­tween the two air hubs, down from the 49 weekly flights pre-pan­demic. More flights are ex­pected to be added once the ar­range­ment of­fi­cially starts.</p>
    <p>In­de­pen­dent avi­a­tion an­a­lyst Bren­dan So­bie from So­bie Avi­a­tion noted that it is still too early to say what fares will look like once more de­tails are re­leased.</p>
    <p>There are no caps on the num­ber of air travel bub­ble flights that can be added, he said, and fares could be pre­set or capped. This means that it is pos­si­ble for prices to fall.</p>
    <p>How­ever, the de­mand for travel be­tween Sin­ga­pore and Hong Kong will likely far ex­ceed the sup­ply in the ini­tial months, he added.</p>
    <p>“There has been an in­crease in book­ings on (the cur­rent) flights, which is prob­a­bly driven by pas­sen­gers hop­ing they will be moved to flights that are part of the bub­ble once the bub­ble is an­nounced, or pas­sen­gers not re­al­is­ing these flights are not part of the bub­ble,” he said.</p>
    <p>“The in­crease in Sin­ga­poreHong Kong flight searches and book­ings the last few weeks is an in­di­ca­tion of the pent-up de­mand for travel, but con­sumers should un­der­stand that flights un­der the bub­ble have not yet been an­nounced or sched­uled.”</p>
    <p>SIA said those who pur­chased tick­ets be­fore the travel bub­ble opens can choose to re­book for a later flight with­out in­cur­ring ex­tra charges. How­ever, they may need to top up any fare dif­fer­ences.</p>
    <p>The op­por­tu­ni­ties pro­vided by the bub­ble are a shot in the arm for SIA, which is now seek­ing to make a ten­ta­tive re­cov­ery from the worst cri­sis to have hit the air in­dus­try in his­tory.</p>
    <p>SIA told The Sun­day Times that in ad­di­tion to a new long-haul flight be­tween Sin­ga­pore and New York’s John F. Kennedy In­ter­na­tional Air­port start­ing this month, it is also look­ing to re­in­state flights to Brunei, Fukuoka, Kathmandu and Male in the com­ing months.</p>
    <p>This means it will have flights to 41 des­ti­na­tions – still fewer than half of the 92 des­ti­na­tions it was fly­ing to last year.</p>
    <p>With the new ad­di­tions, the SIA Group projects its pas­sen­ger ca­pac­ity to reach 15 per cent of preCovid-19 lev­els by the end of next month. This stood at 9.5 per cent last month.</p>
    <p>Mr So­bie said fig­ures so far in­di­cate that SIA has been adding ca­pac­ity back faster than de­mand, and that the num­ber of pas­sen­gers trav­el­ling re­mains ex­tremely low.</p>
    <p>With the con­tin­ued strict re­quire­ments, quo­tas and closed bor­ders, 43,000 peo­ple flew with the SIA Group in Septem­ber, com­pared with 3.1 mil­lion peo­ple in the same month last year, he said.</p>
    <p>“The very lim­ited pas­sen­ger traf­fic are not from tourists, but gen­er­ally con­sists of one-way repa­tri­at­ing traf­fic. This in­cludes work­ers de­part­ing or ar­riv­ing in Sin­ga­pore, as well as some tran­sit traf­fic which is also gen­er­ally one-way,” he said.</p>
    <p>“Pas­sen­ger flights are be­ing added as it is im­por­tant strate­gi­cally to re­store the net­work, and there is also an op­por­tu­nity to carry cargo on all ad­di­tional pas­sen­ger flights.”</p>
    <p>For some, even the prom­ise of the travel bub­ble might not be enough to en­tice them back to fly­ing. Mr Nitin Kakaria, 41, who needs to travel fre­quently around Asia for his work in the fi­nan­cial in­dus­try, said pay­ing for the Covid-19 tests – which some­times cost him more than $1,000 each – makes fly­ing pro­hib­i­tive.</p>
    <p>“I’m not re­ally con­cerned about the virus, as I think the Gov­ern­ment has it un­der con­trol, but the sub­stan­tially higher costs mean it is not worth it un­less I fly and stay in that coun­try for two to three weeks,” he said.</p>
    <p>He will keep check­ing the fares to Hong Kong, how­ever.</p>
    <p>“Hope­fully, the in­creases will sta­bilise,” he said.</p>
    <p>SIA said those who pur­chased tick­ets be­fore the travel bub­ble opens can choose to re­book for a later flight with­out in­cur­ring ex­tra charges. How­ever, they may need to top up any fare dif­fer­ences.</p>
