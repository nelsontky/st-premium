    <p>Sev­eral cities across In­dia have an­nounced lock­downs again to con­trol spikes in the num­ber of peo­ple in­fected with Covid-19.</p>
    <p>In­dia has recorded more than 907,000 Covid-19 cases and al­most 24,000 deaths since it re­ported its first case in Jan­uary, de­spite a two-month na­tion­wide lockdown from March 24. This makes it the coun­try with the third-high­est num­ber of coro­n­avirus cases in the world, af­ter the US and Brazil.</p>
    <p>The fed­eral gov­ern­ment be­gan eas­ing re­stric­tions last month and has fo­cused since then on mak­ing guide­lines for test­ing and treat­ment, while let­ting In­dia’s di­verse state gov­ern­ments han­dle the dayto-day man­age­ment of in­fec­tions and the econ­omy as they see fit.</p>
    <p>As in­fec­tions rise, dif­fer­ent states have reim­posed a lockdown in densely pop­u­lated cities.</p>
    <p>Kar­nataka’s state cap­i­tal Ban­ga­lore, which recorded over 1,300 cases on Mon­day, is again on a strict week-long lockdown from last night. Last month, the city and ad­ja­cent ru­ral ar­eas saw in­fec­tions tre­ble as many res­i­dents threw cau­tion to the wind af­ter curbs were eased.</p>
    <p>This time, Ban­ga­lore’s pri­vate and pub­lic trans­port will shut un­til next Wed­nes­day. Only sched­uled flights and trains can op­er­ate. Gro­cery shops can open from 5am to noon, and phar­ma­cies all day, but whole­sale mar­kets and malls will be closed. Home de­liv­er­ies are al­lowed, but most gov­ern­ment and pri­vate of­fices will close ex­cept banks and post of­fices, which can stay open but with fewer staff.</p>
    <p>Un­like the pre­vi­ous lockdown, no move­ment passes will be is­sued this time, ex­cept for med­i­cal pro­fes­sion­als and of­fi­cials en­gaged in Covid-19 re­lief work. A full Sun­day lockdown in place since last month will con­tinue across the state.</p>
    <p>Kar­nataka’s Chief Min­is­ter B.S. Yediyu­rappa, who is un­der home quar­an­tine af­ter three of his staff tested pos­i­tive for Covid-19, said the strict guide­lines were is­sued to “con­trol the num­ber of cases and for of­fi­cials to take steps to ad­dress short­falls of hos­pi­tal beds”.</p>
    <p>In Ma­ha­rash­tra, In­dia’s worstaf­fected state with over 254,000 in­fec­tions, Pune city is un­der a strict 10-day lockdown that be­gan on Mon­day. The ed­u­ca­tion hub has the high­est num­ber of cases in the state.</p>
    <p>Pune’s two-phase lockdown sees the city closed till Satur­day. From</p>
    <p>Sun­day, shops can open from 8am to noon and e-com­merce de­liv­er­ies can re­sume. But parks, play­grounds and pri­vate of­fices will re­main closed, and pri­vate ve­hi­cles can­not ply the roads, ex­cept for those pro­vid­ing es­sen­tial ser­vices.</p>
    <p>Thiru­vanan­tha­pu­ram, a city with over 740 Covid-19 cases, the high­est in the southern state of Ker­ala, ex­tended its lockdown im­posed on July 6 to next Mon­day. This came af­ter a large num­ber of cases from un­known sources cre­ated mul­ti­ple clus­ters in the city.</p>
    <p>Thou­sands of ex­pa­tri­ates re­turn­ing every day, es­pe­cially those from the Mid­dle East, have shaved a lit­tle off Ker­ala’s head start in con­trol­ling the pan­demic. Ker­ala has re­ported over 8,300 in­fec­tions, most of them recorded since mid-June.</p>
    <p>The north­ern state of Bi­har, which crossed 16,000 Covid-19 in­fec­tions, an­nounced a seven-day lockdown in 11 dis­tricts af­ter its high­est-ever spike of 1,266 cases on Sun­day. This in­cludes the cap­i­tal Patna, which has al­ready been un­der strict re­stric­tions since last Fri­day.</p>
    <p>Jammu and Kash­mir, As­sam, Na­ga­land and Arunachal Pradesh ex­tended lock­downs in their cap­i­tal cities.</p>
