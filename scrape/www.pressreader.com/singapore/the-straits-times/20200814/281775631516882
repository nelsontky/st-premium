    <p>For­mer Malaysian prime min­is­ter Ma­hathir Mo­hamad’s new Parti Pe­juang Tanah Air (Pe­juang) is hop­ing to be the king­maker in the next gen­eral elec­tion as it en­ters a crowded po­lit­i­cal field with at least five Malay-based par­ties.</p>
    <p>The aim is to cap­ture enough of the Malay vote so that the two-time premier re­mains a ma­jor player, and Pe­juang could emerge as the king­maker if votes are split evenly among the Malay elec­torate as they did in 2018.</p>
    <p>“Ma­hathir’s party ob­vi­ously will split the Malay vote fur­ther,” Pro­fes­sor James Chin, direc­tor of the Asia In­sti­tute, Univer­sity of Tas­ma­nia, told The Straits Times.</p>
    <p>Malays make up 60 per cent of the coun­try’s 32 mil­lion pop­u­la­tion. Their votes are split be­tween Umno, the fun­da­men­tal­ist Parti Is­lam SeMalaysia (PAS), op­po­si­tion leader An­war Ibrahim’s Parti Kead­i­lan Rakyat, Prime Min­is­ter Muhyid­din Yassin’s Parti Pribumi Ber­satu Malaysia and the mod­er­ate Is­lamic Parti Amanah Ne­gara.</p>
    <p>In 2018, Umno and PAS each won one-third of the votes.</p>
    <p>“We may not have enough (num­bers) to form a gov­ern­ment, but we can be a party that de­ter­mines who will win,” Tun Dr Ma­hathir, 95, said last Fri­day.</p>
    <p>In the long run, Pe­juang’s rise could jeop­ar­dise and crip­ple Ber­satu, caus­ing it to lose at the next elec­tion, just months after it ex­pelled Dr Ma­hathir, who was its co-founder and chair­man.</p>
    <p>“The clash of the Red Ber­satu (Tan Sri Muhyid­din’s fac­tion) and the Black Ber­satu (Dr Ma­hathir’s group) ac­tu­ally does not ben­e­fit ei­ther side, a case of the loser re­duced to ashes and the win­ner con­sumed like coal,” Univer­siti Malaya po­lit­i­cal an­a­lyst, Pro­fes­sor Awang Az­man Awang Pawi, said.</p>
    <p>Dr Ma­hathir still has clout in the op­po­si­tion but it re­mains to be seen what vot­ers, in par­tic­u­lar Malay vot­ers, think of him and his party.</p>
    <p>He could cob­ble to­gether a coali­tion with enough al­lies to be a third force in the next elec­tion. A by-elec­tion in Perak on Aug 29, in which both Umno and Pe­juang will be field­ing can­di­dates, will serve as a lit­mus test of his sup­port.</p>
    <p>“Two fac­tors may swing vot­ers to Ma­hathir, one is (his) pop­u­lar­ity which is still high, and two, those who re­jected Umno,” Dr Nor­shahril Saat, se­nior fel­low at ISEAS - Yu­sof Ishak In­sti­tute, said.</p>
    <p>Dr Ma­hathir’s po­si­tion in Par­lia­ment was much weak­ened after the Fe­bru­ary ouster of the Pakatan Hara­pan (PH) rul­ing coali­tion but he re­mains a force to be reck­oned with.</p>
    <p>Mr Muhyid­din’s Perikatan Na­sional gov­ern­ment has a ra­zor-thin ma­jor­ity in Par­lia­ment while PH can­not re­turn to power with­out Dr Ma­hathir’s sup­port.</p>
    <p>“A hung Par­lia­ment could mean Pe­juang can play a de­ci­sive role in shap­ing the next gov­ern­ment and even form one, if there are enough al­lies,” said Dr Nor­shahril.</p>
    <p>Dr Ma­hathir’s lat­est gam­bit, not sur­pris­ingly, has also led to brick­bats, par­tic­u­larly from ri­vals.</p>
    <p>“To es­tab­lish a po­lit­i­cal party is not easy and it takes time… and be­sides, why would Tun want to es­tab­lish an­other Malay-based po­lit­i­cal party as he has al­ready led Ber­satu... I think the best thing for him is to re­turn to Ber­satu or Umno,” Negeri Sem­bi­lan Ber­satu chair­man Rais Ya­tim said last week.</p>
    <p>Dr Ma­hathir, when an­nounc­ing his party at a po­lit­i­cal rally on Wed­nes­day night, said he was re­spond­ing to cries for help.</p>
    <p>“Many told me enough is enough, you should re­tire. Yes, I wanted to re­tire but when I see many wrongs be­ing com­mit­ted and peo­ple ask me for help, I would be self­ish if I didn’t try to help. What­ever is left of my time is for my race, coun­try and re­li­gion, that’s all.”</p>
