    <p>KUALA LUMPUR The trial in­volv­ing for­mer Malaysian pre­mier Na­jib Razak has been re­garded as “the worst kind” of abuse of po­si­tion, crim­i­nal breach of trust (CBT) and money l aun­der­ing by the High Court judge who convicted him.</p>
    <p>Jus­tice Mohd Na­zlan Mohd Ghaz­ali re­marked that Na­jib also did not ex­press any re­morse af­ter he was found guilty on July 28 of seven counts of cor­rup­tion in the case in­volv­ing RM42 mil­lion (S$13.8 mil­lion) that was de­posited into his per­sonal bank ac­counts.</p>
    <p>The funds be­longed to SRC In­ter­na­tional, a for­mer unit of state fund 1Malaysia De­vel­op­ment Ber­had.</p>
    <p>The judge made his re­marks in a 801-page grounds of j udg­ment, with the re­port dated Aug 21.</p>
    <p>The judg­ment, sighted by The Star, formed part of the ap­peal record sent to the Court of Ap­peal.</p>
    <p>Jus­tice Na­zlan said based on how the crimes were com­mit­ted, the huge sum in­volved and its pub­lic im­pact, he would not hes­i­tate to char­ac­terise the case as “the worst kind” of abuse of po­si­tion, CBT and money laun­der­ing.</p>
    <p>“And per­haps most im­por­tantly, it in­volved the per­son who at the ma­te­rial time was in the high­est rank­ing au­thor­ity in the gov­ern­ment,” he wrote.</p>
    <p>The judge sen­tenced Na­jib to 12 years in jail and a fine of RM210 mil­lion, in de­fault of five years’ jail for the sin­gle count of abuse of power.</p>
    <p>Na­jib was sen­tenced to 10 years’ jail each for the three counts of CBT and three counts of money laun­der­ing. All jail time was or­dered to run con­cur­rently.</p>
    <p>Na­jib, in his mit­i­ga­tion speech where he di­rectly ad­dressed the judge, had de­scribed his achieve­ments over his nine years as prime min­is­ter, and re­cited the Mus­lim oath to deny any knowl­edge where the money came from.</p>
    <p>Jus­tice Na­zlan said there was no deny­ing that Na­jib had in­deed made con­tri­bu­tions to the well-be­ing and the bet­ter­ment of the na­tion dur­ing his ten­ure as the prime min­is­ter.</p>
    <p>“Po­lit­i­cal his­tory will con­tinue to de­bate whether he has done on bal</p>
    <p>ance more good than harm. But this very process would ar­guably be in­im­i­cal to the ideals of a clean ad­min­is­tra­tion that does not tol­er­ate cor­rup­tion and abuse of power,” he said.</p>
    <p>Jus­tice Na­zlan said that whether the moral com­pass of the na­tion re­quired some re­cal­i­bra­tion was de­serv­ing of a sep­a­rate dis­course.</p>
    <p>“What this court seeks to af­firm is the sanc­tity of the rule of law and the supremacy of the Con­sti­tu­tion.</p>
    <p>“No one – not even one who was the most pow­er­ful po­lit­i­cal fig­ure and the leader of the coun­try – en­joys a cloak of in­vin­ci­bil­ity from the force of the law,” he wrote, as quoted by the Free Malaysia To­day news site.</p>
    <p>The court also found it of no use to fig­ure out the rea­son­ing be­hind Na­jib’s of­fences.</p>
    <p>“There is lit­tle merit in this court pon­tif­i­cat­ing and lament­ing on why the ac­cused had done what he did, de­spite (or be­cause of) his undis­puted stand­ing at the apex of the vast wealth of power and un­par­al­leled au­thor­ity.</p>
    <p>“The ac­cused, I re­peat, is a per­son with a keen in­tel­lect and must surely have a firm sense of right and wrong,” Jus­tice Na­zlan added.</p>
    <p>Na­jib on July 30 filed a no­tice of ap­peal against his con­vic­tion and sen­tence.</p>
    <p>Case man­age­ment in the ap­peal has been fixed for Oct 15.</p>
