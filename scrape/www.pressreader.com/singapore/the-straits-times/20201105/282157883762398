    <p>Par­lia­ment yes­ter­day voted to amend a mo­tion moved by Work­ers’ Party (WP) chair­man Sylvia Lim (Alju­nied GRC) on the crim­i­nal jus­tice sys­tem in the wake of the ac­quit­tal of for­mer maid Parti Liyani.</p>
    <p>The mo­tion, which saw 13 MPs and six of­fice-hold­ers join the de­bate, orig­i­nally stated: “That this House af­firms that fair­ness, ac­cess and in­de­pen­dence are cor­ner­stones of Sin­ga­pore’s jus­tice sys­tem, and calls on the Gov­ern­ment to recog­nise and rem­edy its short­com­ings in or­der to en­hance jus­tice for all, re­gard­less of means or so­cial sta­tus, in­clud­ing fa­cil­i­tat­ing a re­view of the jus­tice sys­tem.”</p>
    <p>But to­wards the end of the de­bate, Mr Mu­rali Pil­lai (Bukit Ba­tok) sug­gested amend­ments to the orig­i­nal mo­tion, which Par­lia­ment then voted on and passed.</p>
    <p>The WP MPs dis­sented against the amend­ments, which changed the mo­tion to state: “That this House recog­nises that fair­ness, ac­cess and in­de­pen­dence are cor­ner­stones of Sin­ga­pore’s jus­tice sys­tem, and af­firms the Gov­ern­ment’s con­tin­u­ous ef­forts since in­de­pen­dence to build a fair and just so­ci­ety and rem­edy any short­com­ing in or­der to en­hance jus­tice for all, re­gard­less of race, lan­guage, re­li­gion, eco­nomic means, or so­cial sta­tus.”</p>
    <p>In ex­plain­ing his changes, Mr Mu­rali, who chairs the Gov­ern­ment Par­lia­men­tary Com­mit­tee for Home Af­fairs and Law, said the de­bate re­flected “broad agree­ment” from both sides of the House about the im­por­tance of fair­ness, ac­cess and in­de­pen­dence be­ing es­sen­tial to Sin­ga­pore’s jus­tice sys­tem.</p>
    <p>He also noted that there is recog­ni­tion from both sides of the House that there are con­tin­u­ous ef­forts to im­prove the jus­tice sys­tem.</p>
    <p>On delet­ing the last part of Ms</p>
    <p>Lim’s orig­i­nal mo­tion about fa­cil­i­tat­ing a re­view of the jus­tice sys­tem, Mr Mu­rali said this was to leave the mo­tion in “broad terms” so that the Gov­ern­ment would rem­edy any short­com­ings that are brought up and take fur­ther steps needed in Par­lia­ment. “At the end of the day, the buck stops with this House. It is this House that has to make the po­lit­i­cal de­ci­sions to pass leg­is­la­tion to move amend­ments to the Con­sti­tu­tion in re­la­tion to the jus­tice sys­tem,” he said.</p>
    <p>“So the buck must stop here and this mo­tion re­flects that re­al­ity.”</p>
    <p>Ms Lim said her party did not sup­port the amended ver­sion pro­posed by Mr Mu­rali as it im­plied there are no short­com­ings in the sys­tem, and that there will be no re­view of the sys­tem– key as­pects of the orig­i­nal mo­tion.</p>
    <p>Mr Mu­rali replied that it was not his in­ten­tion to sug­gest that the Gov­ern­ment does not ad­mit to any past short­com­ings.</p>
    <p>He said: “The point I was stress­ing in my speech was that there were short­com­ings in the past but the Gov­ern­ment con­tin­ues to ex­pend ef­fort to im­prove the sys­tem, and to en­sure jus­tice for all.”</p>
    <p>Law and Home Af­fairs Min­is­ter K. Shan­mugam had de­liv­ered a min­is­te­rial state­ment on Ms Parti’s case be­fore Par­lia­ment de­bated Ms Lim’s mo­tion.</p>
    <p>Ms Parti’s ac­quit­tal by the High Court of steal­ing from her for­mer em­ploy­ers, the fam­ily of for­mer Changi Air­port Group chair­man Liew Mun Leong, had sparked a public up­roar and raised ques­tions about the crim­i­nal jus­tice sys­tem.</p>
    <p>Peo­ple’s Ac­tion Party MPs who joined the de­bate up­held Sin­ga­pore’s jus­tice sys­tem, but also un­der­scored the im­por­tance of con­stantly im­prov­ing this sys­tem.</p>
    <p>Some, like Mr Xie Yao Quan (Jurong GRC) and Mr Vikram Nair (Sem­bawang GRC), said that in spite of the ac­quit­tal and any lapses in investigat­ions, Sin­ga­pore’s law en­force­ment and jus­tice sys­tem re­mains one of the best.</p>
    <p>Mr Xie cau­tioned against cast­ing as­per­sions on the en­tirety of Sin­ga­pore’s jus­tice sys­tem based on some mal­prac­tices found in Ms Parti’s case. Other MPs like Mr Christo­pher de Souza (Hol­land-Bukit Timah GRC) said amend­ments are con­tin­u­ally made to Sin­ga­pore’s jus­tice sys­tem to en­sure it re­mains as ro­bust and fair as pos­si­ble.</p>
    <p>Po­lit­i­cal of­fice-hold­ers also chimed in dur­ing the de­bate to re­spond to the WP MPs.</p>
    <p>For in­stance, Mr Leon Per­era (Alju­nied GRC) had called for the set­ting up of an om­buds­man that will func­tion as an in­de­pen­dent of­fice open to all Sin­ga­pore­ans to in­ves­ti­gate complaints about un­fair ad­min­is­tra­tive de­ci­sions or ac­tions of a public agency.</p>
    <p>Sec­ond Min­is­ter for Law Ed­win Tong said om­buds­men in other coun­tries have their fail­ings and that Sin­ga­pore cur­rently has a num­ber of ex­ter­nal re­view pan­els, though he agreed that there is room to re­fine the jus­tice sys­tem.</p>
    <p>WP chief and Leader of the Op­po­si­tion Pri­tam Singh had called for the prose­cu­tion’s duty to the court to dis­close rel­e­vant ma­te­rial not favourable to its case to be cod­i­fied in the Crim­i­nal Procedure Code.</p>
    <p>Mr Shan­mugam said the Gov­ern­ment has had in­ter­nal dis­cus­sions on this since early this year.</p>
    <p>Mr Singh also re­it­er­ated an ear­lier call for the At­tor­ney-Gen­eral’s dual roles as public pros­e­cu­tor and the Gov­ern­ment’s le­gal ad­viser to be sep­a­rated.</p>
    <p>Re­spond­ing, Min­is­ter i n t he Prime Min­is­ter’s Of­fice In­dra­nee Ra­jah said there are con­sti­tu­tional safe­guards to en­sure the At­tor­ney­Gen­eral is pro­tected from po­lit­i­cal pres­sures and able to dis­charge both roles with­out fear or favour.</p>
