    <p>A spike in dengue fever cases in re­cent months has not placed an un­due bur­den on Sin­ga­pore’s health­care sys­tem, said the Health Min­istry’s di­rec­tor of med­i­cal ser­vices Ken­neth Mak yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>As­so­ciate Pro­fes­sor Mak added that while there has been an in­crease in the num­ber of peo­ple go­ing to clin­ics or emer­gency de­part­ments with fever and tests are needed to de­ter­mine if they have dengue or not, this in­crease is “still man­age­able”.</p>
    <p>“The ma­jor­ity of cases with dengue do not re­quire in­pa­tient care and can be safely man­aged in an out­pa­tient set­ting,” he said at a vir­tual press con­fer­ence. “Be­cause of this, our hos­pi­tals have not been un­duly bur­dened with need­ing to ad­mit too many pa­tients as a re­sult of dengue.”</p>
    <p>The spike in dengue cases comes as Sin­ga­pore is still grap­pling with the coro­n­avirus out­break.</p>
    <p>The coun­try has seen an un­prece­dented out­break of dengue this year, with close to 20,000 cases so far. The Na­tional En­vi­ron­ment Agency (NEA) has said the to­tal num­ber of cases is ex­pected to ex­ceed the pre­vi­ous high of 22,170 cases re­ported in 2013.</p>
    <p>Prof Mak said that dengue fever and Covid-19 share some com­mon symp­toms such as fever. It is im­por­tant for doc­tors to be mind­ful of this and con­duct the nec­es­sary tests to de­ter­mine which con­di­tion a pa­tient has, he added.</p>
    <p>“So, the in­creas­ing cases of dengue lead us to test a bit more, to be ab­so­lutely sure about what we are deal­ing with.</p>
    <p>“We have seen in­creased cases com­ing to see doc­tors in both the in­pa­tient and out­pa­tient set­ting but, in fact, it has not led to a big bur­den for us at this stage. We con­tinue to keep a close watch on this.”</p>
    <p>The Health Min­istry is work­ing with the NEA on erad­i­cat­ing mos­quito breed­ing spots in the com­mu­nity, he said.</p>
    <p>A record 1,733 dengue cases were re­ported last week, the high­est num­ber of weekly dengue cases recorded in Sin­ga­pore to date. Last week was also the sixth con­sec­u­tive week for which the weekly num­ber of re­ported dengue cases ex­ceeded 1,000.</p>
    <p>The high­est weekly in­fec­tion num­ber in pre­vi­ous years was 891 in 2014.</p>
    <p>Nine­teen peo­ple have died of dengue so far this year.</p>
