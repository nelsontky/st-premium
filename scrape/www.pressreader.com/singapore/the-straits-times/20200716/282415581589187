    <p>Many fit­ness gyms and stu­dios in Sin­ga­pore were forced to go vir­tual fol­low­ing the in­tro­duc­tion of the cir­cuit breaker in April.</p>
    <p>But as the Re­pub­lic eases into its phased re­open­ing, on­line classes in the mar­tial arts sec­tor could be here to stay, es­pe­cially with many con­tin­u­ing to work from home, var­i­ous in­dus­try play­ers have told The Straits Times.</p>
    <p>Spar­tans Box­ing Club, which has four branches in Joo Chiat, Balestier, Down­town East and Seran­goon Gar­dens, has been putting up pre-recorded videos on­line that teach var­i­ous tech­niques in­clud­ing how to t hrow ba­sic punches.</p>
    <p>“As soon as the cir­cuit breaker started, we not only did on­line work­outs but kept the com­mu­nity to­gether,” said its man­ag­ing di­rec­tor Rus­sell Har­ri­son. “We do daily Zoom work­outs that (fit into) the con­sumers’ time sched­ule and have classes three times a day at 8am, 12.30 pm and 6pm.”</p>
    <p>Ser­vice de­signer Raz­iff Lau, 31, who picked up box­ing at Spar­tans in Fe­bru­ary, feels on­line work­outs are con­ve­nient as he can start right away from the com­fort of his home and cut down on trav­el­ling time.</p>
    <p>Ruchdi Ha­j­jar, the founder of The Ring Box­ing Com­mu­nity, noted how they had no more than seven par­tic­i­pants when they started vir­tual classes. “Dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker, we saw num­bers grow­ing day by day and had 15 to 20 peo­ple, but that has gone down in Phase 2 with them re­turn­ing to the gym,” he said.</p>
    <p>But the num­ber of stu­dents at­tend­ing classes on site com­pared to be­fore the pan­demic has dropped by 30 per cent, mainly due to safe dis­tanc­ing mea­sures.</p>
    <p>Ha­j­jar said that vir­tual classes are key to the busi­ness and it will con­tinue to run them to of­fer mem­bers “a more in­te­grated ex­pe­ri­ence”.</p>
    <p>Mixed mar­tial arts (MMA) chain Evolve MMA also has vir­tual classes in Muay Thai, box­ing and Brazil­ian jiu-jitsu.</p>
    <p>Its vice-pres­i­dent Wes­ley de Souza said: “In each class, in ad­di­tion to the world cham­pion in­struc­tors teach­ing on screen, we also have in­struc­tors who mon­i­tor the stu­dents’ train­ing and give them in­di­vid­u­alised feed­back in real-time.”</p>
    <p>Even though sports fa­cil­i­ties here have re­opened in phase two, he added that “the on­line com­po­nent will re­main a big part of the Evolve MMA pro­gramme”.</p>
    <p>Pro­fes­sional boxer Muhamad Rid­hwan, a co-owner of Legends Fight Sport at Car­pen­ter Street, high­lighted the need to pro­duce dig­i­tal con­tent to dif­fer­en­ti­ate his busi­ness.</p>
    <p>“We had zero in­come (dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker) due to the sus­pended mem­ber­ships and the short in­struc­tional videos on my on­line plat­forms helped with brand aware­ness and our on­line pres­ence,” he added.</p>
    <p>He is now work­ing on pro­vid­ing more on­line con­tent for pay­ing mem­bers. They will soon have ac­cess to vir­tual classes such as yoga, dance ex­er­cises, and HIIT (high-in­ten­sity in­ter­val train­ing). The con­tent will in­clude blogs, cook­ing videos and healthy recipes.</p>
    <p>Arvind Lal­wani, di­rec­tor and head coach at Jug­ger­naut Fight Club, es­ti­mated that 40 per cent of its reg­u­lars turned to vir­tual classes dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker.</p>
    <p>But he said the club, which of­fers box­ing, wrestling and MMA classes, will al­ways pri­ori­tise the in­per­son ex­pe­ri­ence.</p>
    <p>“There is only so much you can do in a vir­tual class,” said the 40-yearold. “For what we do which is highly spe­cialised, we do still need the hu­man in­ter­ac­tion.”</p>
    <p>Bruce Tan, an avid karate ex­po­nent, agreed that there is no real sub­sti­tute for the gym.</p>
    <p>The 20-year-old brown belt said his dojo is still the best place for him to prac­tise his art.</p>
    <p>He said: “The dojo that I at­tend uses mats, which is what is used in com­pe­ti­tions. Train­ing at home has a dif­fer­ent feel­ing. In some ways, it is bet­ter to ex­plore dif­fer­ent en­vi­ron­ments to prac­tise karate in, but at the same time, I do pre­fer the reg­u­lar mats that I am ac­cus­tomed to.”</p>
