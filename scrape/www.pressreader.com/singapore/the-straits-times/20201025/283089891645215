    <p>I am not a fan of bold pro­nun­ci­a­tions about spend­ing, like: Never buy a boat! Stop drink­ing lat­tes! Don’t buy a new car!</p>
    <p>They seem de­signed more to at­tract at­ten­tion than im­part wis­dom. I pre­fer ra­tio­nal guide­lines that help con­sumers make bet­ter spend­ing de­ci­sions.</p>
    <p>No, you do not need to be a mil­lion­aire or make al­most half a mil­lion dol­lars per year to pur­chase a new mid-sized sedan or small sport util­ity ve­hi­cle (SUV). What is more im­por­tant is what makes peo­ple happy and how peo­ple of­ten make fi­nan­cial de­ci­sions un­con­sciously.</p>
    <p>With that in mind, con­sider this as a bet­ter ap­proach to big-ticket pur­chase de­ci­sions.</p>
    <p>BUD­GET</p>
    <p>It is sur­pris­ing how of­ten peo­ple do not op­er­ate with a writ­ten monthly bud­get. Con­sumers need to un­der­stand their own bal­ance sheets to be able to make in­tel­li­gent fi­nan­cial de­ci­sions.</p>
    <p>Noth­ing is more ba­sic than putting your fi­nan­cial life on a spread­sheet, in­clud­ing in­come and monthly ex­penses. Keep­ing track of an­nual costs such as travel or va­ca­tion, and the oc­ca­sional ir­reg­u­lar spend­ing on items such as wed­dings or home re­pairs is a smart idea.</p>
    <p>You need to know what you can af­ford be­fore you can even get to the ques­tion of whether you should buy it or not. If you do not know what you can af­ford, how can you pos­si­bly make an in­tel­li­gent fi­nan­cial de­ci­sion? This is as true for those shopping for a Hyundai as it is for a Bent­ley.</p>
    <p>PRI­ORI­TISE</p>
    <p>Every pur­chase made is a trade-off against some other use of that cap­i­tal. If you spend money on this, you have less cash avail­able to spend on that. This is es­pe­cially true for homes, cars or any big-ticket item.</p>
    <p>Fig­ure out your pri­or­i­ties and de­cide what is im­por­tant to you and your fam­ily and what mat­ters less. And there are trade-offs even within pur­chases. Do you want speed or efficiency? Style, qual­ity, room, util­ity, com­fort or safety? All ve­hi­cles are a blend of th­ese qual­i­ties, with dif­fer­ent em­pha­sis de­pend­ing upon the au­di­ence the man­u­fac­ture is tar­get­ing.</p>
    <p>DON’T EN­GAGE IN MIND­LESS CON­SUMERISM</p>
    <p>Be­yond the sim­ple ques­tion of what you can af­ford is the un­der­ly­ing rea­son why you are mak­ing pur­chases. There is much to be said for hav­ing an aware­ness of what you con­sume and why. I am not a fin­ger-wag­ging nag telling peo­ple NOT to buy things, but I want those de­ci­sions to be pur­pose­ful, bring­ing life sat­is­fac­tion and hap­pi­ness.</p>
    <p>If you re­ally want a man­ual gear­stick, high horse­power con­vert­ible be­cause it puts a grin on your face every time you drive it, that’s fine. But if you are pur­chas­ing an ex­pen­sive, un­re­li­able lux­ury Bri­tish SUV be­cause your neigh­bours did, that raises prob­lem­atic is­sues.</p>
    <p>Con­sumerism of this sort has got so bad my col­league Ben Carl­son re­cently won­dered if ex­pen­sive and (for many, un­nec­es­sary) pickup trucks are par­tially re­spon­si­ble for the pend­ing re­tire­ment cri­sis.</p>
    <p>NEEDS</p>
    <p>Do you need a new car? To­day’s cars are ex­tremely well made, re­li­able and long-last­ing. Used cars built in the past five to 10 years should de­liver 100,000 trou­ble­free miles. Brands with rep­u­ta­tions for re­li­a­bil­ity can eas­ily dou­ble that amount. While cars made to­day have safety fea­tures not avail­able 10 years ago, the 2010 model cars are much safer than the cars from the 1990s.</p>
    <p>UN­DER­STAND WHAT WILL AND WILL NOT BRING YOU JOY</p>
    <p>We know a lot about what makes peo­ple happy and brings life sat­is­fac­tion. Ex­pe­ri­ences beat con­sumer goods, and cre­at­ing mem­o­ries is bet­ter than ac­cu­mu­lat­ing stuff.</p>
    <p>But we also know we are very bad at pre­dict­ing what will ac­tu­ally make us happy. I can say with­out reser­va­tion that fast, beau­ti­ful cars bring me joy. I have owned lots of them, and each one has brought me plea­sure un­til they were even­tu­ally re­placed with some­thing faster and pret­tier (but not nec­es­sar­ily newer). But I’m a car guy, and what makes me happy may not make you happy.</p>
    <p>Find out what you re­ally want to do with your time and money, what brings you life sat­is­fac­tion. And what­ever you do, stop mak­ing pur­chases to show off to neigh­bours.</p>
