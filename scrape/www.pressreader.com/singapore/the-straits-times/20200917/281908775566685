    <p>Sev­eral Malaysian par­lia­men­tar­i­ans have formed a rare bi­par­ti­san group to try to put an end to the party-hop­ping culture that caused the col­lapse of the fed­eral gov­ern­ment and five state gov­ern­ments in the last six months.</p>
    <p>But with an anti-hop­ping law al­ready de­clared un­con­sti­tu­tional by the coun­try’s high­est court, the MPs are look­ing at other pos­si­ble so­lu­tions which, if ap­proved and rat­i­fied, could mean sig­nif­i­cant changes to the elec­toral sys­tem.</p>
    <p>Last month, a for­mer Cab­i­net min­is­ter, Padang Ren­gas MP Nazri Ab­dul Aziz, was ap­pointed chair­man of a par­lia­men­tary cau­cus to look into stop­ping law­mak­ers from turn­ing into “katak” or frogs, as those who switch par­ties are often called.</p>
    <p>He is a mem­ber of the rul­ing Perikatan Na­sional (PN) coalition and its big­gest party Umno.</p>
    <p>Datuk Seri Nazri has been vo­cal in de­nounc­ing party hop­ping in re­cent months, say­ing the prac­tice was “em­bar­rass­ing”.</p>
    <p>“We have had this prob­lem for 30 years now,” Mr Nazri said, re­fer­ring to a court case brought by the Ke­lan­tan state gov­ern­ment in 1992 to in­val­i­date party hop­ping, which was ul­ti­mately un­suc­cess­ful.</p>
    <p>In late Fe­bru­ary, the 22-mon­thold Pakatan Hara­pan (PH) gov­ern­ment led by then pre­mier Ma­hathir Mo­hamad col­lapsed after some 40 fed­eral leg­is­la­tors de­fected.</p>
    <p>They joined up with blocs of other MPs to form the PN gov­ern­ment which is led by Prime Min­is­ter Muhyid­din Yassin.</p>
    <p>The state gov­ern­ment of four of Malaysia’s 13 states also col­lapsed soon after, as state as­sem­bly­men changed sides by aban­don­ing PH. The states of Jo­hor, Perak, Melaka and Kedah are to­day led by PN.</p>
    <p>De­fec­tions, too, caused the col­lapse of the Sabah state gov­ern­ment, lead­ing to the up­com­ing state elec­tions.</p>
    <p>The one-month-old cau­cus is sup­ported by MPs from PH.</p>
    <p>The group has a rep­re­sen­ta­tive from each ma­jor po­lit­i­cal party, cau­cus mem­ber An­thony Loke, a PH MP, told The Straits Times.</p>
    <p>But the big­gest chal­lenge for the cau­cus is to get broad sup­port in Par­lia­ment, as rule changes will likely in­volve an amend­ment to the Con­sti­tu­tion, which must be ap­proved by two-thirds of the Par­lia­ment.</p>
    <p>Mr Nazri has said that ev­ery party in the coun­try had “pro­vi­sion­ally agreed” to back a le­gal amend­ment to end party hop­ping.</p>
    <p>Mr Loke added: “I think all the ma­jor par­ties will agree (to end party hop­ping). All the par­ties are fac­ing the same prob­lem of de­fec­tions.</p>
    <p>“It is a ques­tion of prin­ci­ple. No par­ties can af­ford not to sup­port it.”</p>
    <p>The cau­cus has been given six months to pro­duce a re­port for Par­lia­ment on the steps needed to end party hop­ping.</p>
    <p>Among the sug­ges­tions be­ing ex­plored is Mr Nazri’s call for Malaysia to move away from the cur­rent first-past-the-post elec­tion sys­tem, akin to the sys­tem used in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>The cau­cus is ex­plor­ing a party list sys­tem, which is used in coun­tries such as In­done­sia. This sys­tem ties a con­stituency not to a law­maker, but to his party.</p>
    <p>This would ren­der de­fec­tions mean­ing­less, forc­ing an elected rep­re­sen­ta­tive to think twice before join­ing an­other party.</p>
    <p>Still, politi­cians and an­a­lysts said an anti-hop­ping law seems un­likely to be in­tro­duced in Malaysia.</p>
    <p>This is be­cause Malaysia’s high­est court had ruled in the 1992 case that “free­dom of as­so­ci­a­tion” is a con­sti­tu­tional free­dom.</p>
    <p>The then Supreme Court held that chang­ing po­lit­i­cal par­ties was part of free­dom of as­so­ci­a­tion granted un­der the Con­sti­tu­tion.</p>
    <p>Mr Shazwan Mustafa Ka­mal, a se­nior as­so­ciate at gov­ern­ment reg­u­la­tory af­fairs and po­lit­i­cal risk con­sul­tancy firm Vriens & Part­ners, said that while the cau­cus was a pos­i­tive devel­op­ment, it re­mains to be seen if it will trans­late into an “ac­tion­able” out­come.</p>
    <p>“Such a move would pos­si­bly re­quire some form of con­sti­tu­tional amend­ment, as well as par­lia­men­tary sup­port from both the rul­ing gov­ern­ment and fed­eral op­po­si­tion,” Mr Shazwan told The Straits Times.</p>
    <p>He said it is “po­lit­i­cally ex­pe­di­ent” to al­low MPs free­dom of as­so­ci­a­tion in the coun­try’s fluid po­lit­i­cal arena.</p>
    <p>“At the end of the day, num­bers re­main piv­otal for any coalition, and ev­ery po­lit­i­cal party wants to be a king­maker,” he added.</p>
