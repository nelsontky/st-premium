    <p>Sin­ga­pore’s bus en­thu­si­asts are driven by many things – nos­tal­gia, a geeky ob­ses­sion with elec­tron­ics and de­sign and a de­sire to doc­u­ment his­tory in a coun­try known for its re­lent­less devel­op­ment.</p>
    <p>Th­ese hob­by­ists, who are mostly men, hit the streets and scrap­yards for the sight of buses and bus parts. They pho­to­graph buses, col­lect old bus parts and some­times re­pur­pose them.</p>
    <p>“Buses are the most ‘bul­let­proof’ trans­port,” says bus lover Muham­mad Zakaria Azmi, 29. “If you have knowl­edge of the routes, you’ve got so many choices.”</p>
    <p>Mr Zakaria, who works as a train con­troller, has about 500 sign­boards, elec­tron­ics and other para­pher­na­lia in the master bed­room of the Hous­ing Board flat he shares with his par­ents.</p>
    <p>“It’s good to doc­u­ment all th­ese things, so peo­ple can re­mem­ber. I wish to con­trib­ute to anyone who might be do­ing re­search,” he says.</p>
    <p>One of the pieces in his col­lec­tion is the li­cence plate SBS2701Z, which con­tains his birth­day, Jan 27, and his ini­tial, Z.</p>
    <p>He has sign­boards of de­funct ser­vices and notes changes to routes, fares and bus mod­els. He is also a fan of Scheme B buses, which are pro­vided by pri­vate op­er­a­tors and were in­tro­duced in the 1970s to com­ple­ment ex­ist­ing bus ser­vices.</p>
    <p>Mr Zakaria’s love of buses changed his life in more ways than one. He met his fi­ancee at Brad­dell Bus Park a few years ago, when she was work­ing there and he was pick­ing up some bus guides.</p>
    <p>The cou­ple plan to char­ter an elec­tric bus for their guests when they get mar­ried next year.</p>
    <p>The loose com­mu­nity of bus fans in Sin­ga­pore – who have spawned sev­eral Face­book groups – are a var­ied bunch. Some pay keen at­ten­tion to the dif­fer­ent bus ser­vices, sub­mit­ting feed­back to the au­thor­i­ties and sug­gest­ing how routes might be im­proved.</p>
    <p>They come in all stripes. Bus cap­tain Muhd Naz Far­i­hin, 23, has taken many pho­tos of buses, in­clud­ing bendy buses, elec­tric buses and new buses be­ing towed along the roads at night. He also col­lects model buses and other bus items.</p>
    <p>Oth­ers, like univer­sity stu­dent Ryan Lim, 23, col­lect bus guides. Mr Lim gets a thrill when­ever he spots a mis­print. He points out one such er­ror in a brochure for ser­vice 825, which cites “Bukit Pan­jang” when it should say “Yio Chu Kang”. He now has about 1,000 bus guides at home, mostly from the past two decades.</p>
    <p>What sort of ad­vice do ex­pe­ri­enced hob­by­ists have for those who are new to the game?</p>
    <p>Know your lim­its, says Mr Zakaria, and do not put your­self in dan­ger in your pur­suit.</p>
    <p>“Re­spect is the key word,” he adds. “You need con­tacts, you need to know peo­ple. If you are hum­ble, peo­ple might take to you.”</p>
    <p>Stu­dent San­thosh Ku­mar, 21, adds that he hopes bus com­pa­nies will host more pub­lic events, such as car­ni­vals and open houses.</p>
    <p>“There is a lot of tal­ent in the com­mu­nity, peo­ple who are so knowl­edge­able about en­gines and elec­tri­cal stuff. Imag­ine the wealth of in­for­ma­tion that could be shared if there was a two-way street be­tween en­thu­si­asts and bus com­pa­nies,” he says.</p>
    <p>“When you have (bet­ter) com­mu­ni­ca­tion, you can point out blind spots bus com­pa­nies might not see.”</p>
