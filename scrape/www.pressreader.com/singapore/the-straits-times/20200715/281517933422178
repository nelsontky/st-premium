    <p>There are many more chap­ters to write in the Sin­ga­pore story, which The Straits Times has told for nearly two cen­turies, said Prime Min­is­ter Lee Hsien Loong yes­ter­day, adding that he hoped it would “live on to con­tinue to do so”.</p>
    <p>In a mes­sage con­grat­u­lat­ing the pub­li­ca­tion on its 175th an­niver­sary to­day, PM Lee said the pa­per’s en­dur­ing le­gacy tes­ti­fies to the trust that gen­er­a­tions of Sin­ga­pore­ans have placed in it.</p>
    <p>Re­count­ing how his fin­gers would be black­ened by the ink of newsprint as he was read­ing the pa­per grow­ing up, he said that these days, read­ers are just as likely to get their news by swip­ing on a screen.</p>
    <p>“The for­mat may have changed, but The Straits Times re­mains true to its mis­sion: de­liv­er­ing the lat­est news and in-depth anal­y­sis on the re­gion and the world,” he said. “It also pro­vides a key plat­form to dis­cuss the in­ter­ests of our com­mu­nity.”</p>
    <p>PM Lee added: “Un­der the watch­ful stew­ard­ship of its edi­tors, jour­nal­ists and pho­tog­ra­phers, The Straits Times must con­tinue to adapt and mod­ernise it­self, to re­main rel­e­vant to read­ers who now have mul­ti­ple sources of news, views and en­ter­tain­ment, on­line and off­line.”</p>
    <p>The Straits Times was es­tab­lished on July 15, 1845 by Ar­me­nian mer­chant Catchick Moses as an eight­page weekly.</p>
    <p>The only time the pa­per has run un­der a dif­fer­ent ti­tle was dur­ing the Ja­panese Oc­cu­pa­tion in World War II.</p>
    <p>In 1984, Sin­ga­pore Press Hold­ings (SPH), which cur­rently owns The Straits Times, was formed through a merger of three or­gan­i­sa­tions: The Straits Times Press Group, Sin­ga­pore News and Pub­li­ca­tions Lim­ited and Times Pub­lish­ing Ber­had.</p>
    <p>The pa­per is cur­rently Sin­ga­pore’s most-read news pub­li­ca­tion, with more than 1.2 mil­lion read­ers across all its print, on­line, mo­bile and other plat­forms, ac­cord­ing to the 2019 Nielsen Con­sumer and Me­dia View Study.</p>
    <p>Its print and dig­i­tal edi­tions have a daily av­er­age cir­cu­la­tion of 370,300.</p>
    <p>Said Mr War­ren Fer­nan­dez, who is ed­i­tor of The Straits Times and ed­i­tor-in-chief of SPH’s English/ Malay/Tamil Me­dia Group: “This is a sig­nif­i­cant mile­stone. Even as we mark it, we are press­ing on with our ef­forts to keep trans­form­ing our news­room to re­main rel­e­vant amid the changes in the me­dia in­dus­try.</p>
    <p>“My col­leagues and I will be meet­ing to­day, vir­tu­ally, to mark the an­niver­sary, be­cause of the pan­demic. We are able to do so be­cause our news­room has grown more adept work­ing with the new on­line and video tech­nolo­gies.”</p>
    <p>In re­cent years, The Straits Times has worked to trans­form from a purely print news­room to a mul­ti­me­dia op­er­a­tion.</p>
    <p>It now puts out news through the day on its web­site, app, so­cial me­dia</p>
    <p>The for­mat may have changed, but The Straits Times re­mains true to its mis­sion: de­liv­er­ing the lat­est news and in-depth anal­y­sis on the re­gion and the world. plat­forms, newsletter­s, ra­dio sta­tions and pod­cast and on­line video shows, such as The Big Story, a daily up­date of the news which airs on Face­book and YouTube.</p>
    <p>Last De­cem­ber, a tablet ver­sion was launched that has gar­nered al­most 16,000 sub­scrip­tions. It al­lows read­ers to re­ceive their daily news­pa­pers dig­i­tally and in­stantly.</p>
    <p>To com­mem­o­rate The Straits Times’ 175th an­niver­sary, to­day’s edi­tion of the pa­per comes with a sec­tion of con­tri­bu­tions from some of the news­pa­per’s se­nior writ­ers, high­light­ing the pa­per’s role in doc­u­ment­ing events here and in the wider world.</p>
    <p>It will also mark the oc­ca­sion with a vir­tual ver­sion of its an­nual ChildAid fund-rais­ing con­cert, jointly or­gan­ised by The Straits Times and The Busi­ness Times. The show, to be streamed on­line at 8pm tonight, will fea­ture a lead­ing-edge 360-de­gree im­mer­sive video ex­pe­ri­ence as well as 8D tech­nol­ogy for a bet­ter au­dio ex­pe­ri­ence.</p>
    <p>It will raise funds for The Straits Times School Pocket Money Fund, which helps about 10,000 dis­ad­van­taged stu­dents pay for their meals and trans­port, and The Busi­ness Times Bud­ding Artists Fund, which sup­ports lessons in the per­form­ing and vis­ual arts for 1,000 fi­nan­cially dis­ad­van­taged chil­dren who are ar­tis­ti­cally tal­ented.</p>
