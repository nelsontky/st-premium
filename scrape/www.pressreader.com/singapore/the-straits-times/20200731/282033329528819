    <p>The for­mer gen­eral man­ager of Gen­neva, a gold in­vest­ment com­pany which owed its cus­tomers gold bars worth al­most $45 mil­lion in to­tal, was sen­tenced to 56 months’ jail yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Kwok Fong Loong, 65, a Malaysian, had pleaded guilty to one count of fraud­u­lent trad­ing ear­lier the same day.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to court doc­u­ments, Gen­neva was in the busi­ness of trad­ing gold bars.</p>
    <p>Among other things, it of­fered a buy-back scheme un­der a contract which promised cus­tomers monthly re­turns of be­tween 2 per cent and 3.1 per cent of the price of the gold they bought from the firm.</p>
    <p>Gen­neva, which was al­ready ex­pe­ri­enc­ing fi­nan­cial dif­fi­cul­ties by 2012, started to de­lay pay­ment of the amounts it owed to its clients, in­clud­ing the monthly re­turns, in July that year.</p>
    <p>It sub­se­quently im­ple­mented a “Gold In­spec­tion” scheme un­der the di­rec­tion of its Malaysian di­rec­tors.</p>
    <p>The new scheme re­quired clients who had pre­vi­ously pur­chased gold bars from Gen­neva to de­posit them with the firm for in­spec­tion.</p>
    <p>The cus­tomers were then told that Gen­neva would re­turn to them an equiv­a­lent quan­tity and pu­rity of gold after a pe­riod of time. Dif­fer­ent clients were in­formed of dif­fer­ent pe­ri­ods, which ranged from three days to a week.</p>
    <p>In­stead, the com­pany dis­posed of the gold bars it had col­lected, in­clud­ing sell­ing the bars to new clients or pawn­ing them for cash.</p>
    <p>“Es­sen­tially, by ob­tain­ing gold on credit from ex­ist­ing clients, Gen­neva used the gold to re­lieve its cash­flow prob­lems by gen­er­at­ing more cash for the com­pany,” said Deputy Pub­lic Pros­e­cu­tor Hon Yi .</p>
    <p>Be­tween Au­gust and Septem­ber 2012, the com­pany col­lected some 3,578.9kg of gold from its clients un­der the scheme. It even­tu­ally started to de­fault on re­turn­ing gold to its cus­tomers, but con­tin­ued to op­er­ate the scheme and col­lect gold from its clients.</p>
    <p>Court doc­u­ments state that as of Sept 30, 2012, Gen­neva still owed its clients gold worth al­most $45 mil­lion in to­tal. Past re­ports had es­ti­mated the com­pany to have more than 10,000 cus­tomers.</p>
    <p>In mit­i­ga­tion, Kwok’s lawyer James Ow Yong said that his client had not ben­e­fited from the scheme.</p>
    <p>How­ever, Dis­trict Judge Ron­ald Gwee said Kwok could have acted as a whis­tle-blower and re­duced the losses suf­fered by the com­pany’s clients.</p>
    <p>The judge back­dated Kwok’s jail term to Feb 22 last year, when he was re­manded.</p>
    <p>For his of­fence, Kwok could have been jailed for up to seven years and fined up to $15,000.</p>
    <p>A case against Gen­neva’s for­mer head of trans­ac­tions Lim Hong Boon, who is also charged with fraud­u­lent trad­ing, is pend­ing.</p>
