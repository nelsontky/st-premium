    <p>Sin­ga­pore Peo­ple’s Party (SPP) chair­man Jose Ray­mond is re­tir­ing from pol­i­tics to fo­cus on ex­pand­ing his busi­ness.</p>
    <p>In a Facebook post yes­ter­day, Mr Ray­mond, 49, an­nounced his “po­lit­i­cal farewell” and thanked his sup­port­ers and vol­un­teers for their ef­forts in his 2020 gen­eral elec­tion cam­paign in Po­tong Pasir.</p>
    <p>“The time has come for me to fo­cus on things which will help me cre­ate im­pact in other ways, to help oth­ers in dif­fer­ent ways and to take my firm re­gional – some­thing which I have been want­ing to do ever since I started the firm in 2016,” said Mr Ray­mond, who is chief strat­egy of­fi­cer at the strat­egy and com­mu­ni­ca­tions ad­vi­sory firm SW Strate­gies.</p>
    <p>“I am truly sorry if I have dis­ap­pointed any of you in any way with my de­ci­sion. The ones who need my help can con­tinue to reach out and I will do what­ever I can within my abil­ity to help as much as pos­si­ble.”</p>
    <p>Mr Ray­mond stood as a can­di­date for the first time in the July 10 elec­tion ear­lier this year. He lost to the Peo­ple’s Ac­tion Party’s Mr Si­toh Yih Pin, the in­cum­bent Po­tong Pasir MP, who won 60.67 per cent of the votes in the sin­gle seat.</p>
    <p>Mr Ray­mond joined SPP in 2017. He be­came its chair­man in Novem­ber last year fol­low­ing the re­tire­ment of the party’s for­mer leader, vet­eran op­po­si­tion politi­cian Chiam See Tong, a month be­fore.</p>
    <p>Mr Ray­mond told The Straits Times his firm opened an of­fice in Malaysia last year and has been ex­plor­ing the pos­si­bil­ity of ex­pand­ing into Indonesia and Thailand.</p>
    <p>“I was spend­ing half my time in Malaysia be­fore Covid-19, and now we are start­ing on the Jakarta chap­ter as well, which is why I need to stay fo­cused on what I need to do,” he said.</p>
    <p>He added that he in­formed SPP of his de­ci­sion last Thurs­day and</p>
    <p>will of­fi­cially step down next month, af­ter serv­ing a 30-day no­tice pe­riod.</p>
    <p>Said Mr Ray­mond: “This is the end of my po­lit­i­cal jour­ney. I stood in the elec­tion be­cause I wanted to ful­fil one of my father’s wishes for me... He told me that when I was 13 years old. I was my father’s care­giver un­til he passed on in 2018 so I wanted to ful­fil that wish.”</p>
    <p>SPP sec­re­tary-gen­eral Steve Chia con­firmed the party’s cen­tral ex­ec­u­tive com­mit­tee had re­ceived Mr Ray­mond’s res­ig­na­tion, and said it would “make a de­ci­sion” at its next meet­ing. He de­clined to elab­o­rate when asked.</p>
    <p>SPP’s for­mer as­sis­tant sec­re­tary­gen­eral Ariffin Sha also re­signed from the party in Au­gust, and the po­si­tion has not been filled, ac­cord­ing to Mr Ray­mond.</p>
    <p>When con­tacted, Mr Ariffin, 23, con­firmed that he had re­signed in Au­gust but did not elab­o­rate on why he did so.</p>
