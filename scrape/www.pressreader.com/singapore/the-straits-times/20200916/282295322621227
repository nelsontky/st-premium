    <p>Lo­cal firms are lead­ing the re­gion when it comes to us­ing tech­nol­ogy to spruce up their op­er­a­tions, a new sur­vey noted yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>It found that 45 per cent of busi­nesses polled in Sin­ga­pore in­di­cated that they have a well-de­fined dig­i­tal strat­egy.</p>
    <p>Hong Kong came in sec­ond at 44 per cent, while Ja­pan – which led the way last year – was next on 41 per cent.</p>
    <p>The DBS Bank sur­vey polled about 1,700 cor­po­rate trea­sur­ers, chief ex­ec­u­tives, chief fi­nan­cial of­fi­cers and busi­ness own­ers from across the re­gion.</p>
    <p>It noted that 99 per cent of busi­nesses in­di­cated that they are fac­ing external pres­sures to trans­form dig­i­tally, cit­ing a more com­pet­i­tive land­scape char­ac­terised by sup­ply chain dis­rup­tions, and the Covid-19 out­break has­ten­ing the pace of dig­i­tal­i­sa­tion.</p>
    <p>The top three dig­i­tal­i­sa­tion chal­lenges were the speed of change, ex­e­cu­tion com­plex­ity and a lack of dig­i­tal ta­lent.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, those polled said cash man­age­ment and trade/sup­ply chain fi­nanc­ing were their two big­gest in­vest­ment ar­eas in terms of dig­i­tal spend.</p>
    <p>The sur­vey also found that 80 per cent of Sin­ga­pore busi­nesses pre­fer fin­tech com­pa­nies as dig­i­tal­i­sa­tion part­ners, a pref­er­ence also ob­served in other de­vel­oped mar­kets, in­clud­ing Hong Kong (73 per cent) and China (69 per cent).</p>
    <p>In con­trast, the vast ma­jor­ity of busi­nesses in Viet­nam, In­done­sia, Thai­land, Malaysia and South Korea favoured banks as dig­i­tal­i­sa­tion part­ners.</p>
    <p>DBS said the use of ap­pli­ca­tion pro­gram­ming in­ter­faces (APIs) and en­ter­prise cloud so­lu­tions in bank con­nec­tiv­ity is ex­pected to con­tinue gain­ing trac­tion in the re­gion.</p>
    <p>In par­tic­u­lar, a big shift to the cloud is ex­pected in the next three years, as it has proven a use­ful tool for busi­nesses to mi­grate data seam­lessly, it added.</p>
    <p>The lender said APIs are the most pop­u­lar mode for bank con­nec­tiv­ity, with 48 per cent of the sur­vey’s re­spon­dents us­ing it in their op­er­a­tions.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, 31 per cent of re­spon­dents said they used cloud-based so­lu­tions.</p>
