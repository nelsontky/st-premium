    <p>A 26-year-old Bangladesh­i con­struc­tion worker was picked up un­der the In­ter­nal Se­cu­rity Act ear­lier this month for his in­volve­ment in ter­ror­ism-re­lated ac­tiv­i­ties.</p>
    <p>Ahmed Faysal was ar­rested on Nov 2, and pre­lim­i­nary in­ves­ti­ga­tions by the In­ter­nal Se­cu­rity De­part­ment found he had been rad­i­calised and in­tended to carry out acts of armed vi­o­lence in sup­port of his re­li­gion, the Min­istry of Home Af­fairs (MHA) said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Faysal, who is Mus­lim, is from the eastern part of Bangladesh and ob­tained his sec­ondary ed­u­ca­tion in a vil­lage madrasah.</p>
    <p>In Fe­bru­ary 2017, he left for Sin­ga­pore and started work for a build­ing prod­ucts com­pany. His rad­i­cal­i­sa­tion jour­ney started in 2018 when he im­bibed pro-Is­lamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS) ma­te­ri­als on­line, the min­istry said.</p>
    <p>Pro­fi­cient in English and adept at us­ing so­cial me­dia, he ac­tively dis­sem­i­nated pro-ISIS pro­pa­ganda, in a mix of English and Ben­gali, that fea­tured the op­pres­sion of Mus­lims over­seas and pro­moted armed vi­o­lence.</p>
    <p>He would trans­late some of the content he found on­line from English to Ben­gali, and re­post it on his so­cial me­dia ac­counts – some of which he cre­ated un­der fic­ti­tious names to evade de­tec­tion – to en­cour­age other Bangladesh­i Mus­lims to take up arms, MHA added.</p>
    <p>He went a step fur­ther and bought fold­able knives that he later con­fessed to the au­thor­i­ties he was plan­ning to use for at­tacks against Hindu po­lice of­fi­cers back home.</p>
    <p>MHA said in­ves­ti­ga­tions so far have not in­di­cated that Faysal in­tended to carry out any acts of vi­o­lence in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>But Home Af­fairs and Law Min­is­ter K. Shan­mugam said yes­ter­day: “If he finds that he can’t go back to Bangladesh im­me­di­ately, could he have de­cided one day to just at­tack peo­ple in Sin­ga­pore?... These things have no bound­aries.”</p>
    <p>Mr Shan­mugam added that the Com­mer­cial Af­fairs De­part­ment is also in­ves­ti­gat­ing Faysal for pos­si­ble ter­ror­ism fi­nanc­ing of­fences.</p>
    <p>The MHA said Faysal is not linked to the string of at­tacks that hap­pened in France last month.</p>
    <p>But he was drawn to ISIS’ goal of estab­lish­ing an Is­lamic caliphate in Syria and wanted to travel there to fight along­side the group against the Syr­ian gov­ern­ment. He be­lieved he would be a mar­tyr if he died while do­ing so, MHA added.</p>
    <p>In the mid­dle of last year, he shifted his al­le­giance to Hayat Tahrir Al-Sham (HTS), another mil­i­tant group fight­ing to es­tab­lish an Is­lamic caliphate in Syria. MHA said: “He do­nated funds to a Syr­i­abased or­gan­i­sa­tion on the un­der­stand­ing that his do­na­tions would ben­e­fit the HTS’ cause in Syria.”</p>
    <p>The min­istry fur­ther said Faysal had ex­pressed sup­port for other ter­ror­ist groups, in­clud­ing the AlQaeda and So­ma­lia-based AlShabaab. It noted that he be­lieved Mus­lims have a duty to en­gage in armed ji­had, to help fel­low Mus­lims who are op­pressed.</p>
    <p>Apart from Syria, he was also will­ing to travel to Kash­mir to fight against the per­ceived en­e­mies of Is­lam, and pre­pared him­self for bat­tle by watch­ing firearms-re­lated videos on­line, the min­istry added.</p>
    <p>But he had a rather dif­fer­ent pub­lic im­age. An MHA spokesman said Faysal lived in a dor­mi­tory and is not known to have in­ter­acted much with his dorm mates.</p>
    <p>“Be­yond his so­cial me­dia ac­tiv­i­ties, there is no in­for­ma­tion that Faysal had tried to in­flu­ence his col­leagues, dor­mi­tory mates or any­one else in Sin­ga­pore with his rad­i­cal views,” the spokesman said. “It ap­pears that none of them were aware of Faysal’s rad­i­cal­i­sa­tion.”</p>
