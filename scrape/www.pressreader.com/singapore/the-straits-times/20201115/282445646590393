    <p>Read­ers of the even­ing Chi­nese daily Lianhe Wan­bao in the 1980s may re­mem­ber a reg­u­lar col­umn on Sin­ga­pore’s early itin­er­ant hawk­ers fea­tur­ing an il­lus­tra­tion ac­com­pa­nied by a short piece of text by artist Chang Yang.</p>
    <p>The en­tire se­ries of 128 pan­els that ran from Oct 31, 1987 to May 16, 1988 has now been trans­lated into English and turned into a book, 1920s-1930s Early Hawk­ers In Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>Pub­lished by Fo­cus Pub­lish­ing and the Na­tional Her­itage Board (NHB), it was trans­lated by Mr Lai Chee Kien, an ar­chi­tec­tural and ur­ban his­to­rian.</p>
    <p>Mr Lai, 55, who re­mem­bers read­ing Chang’s se­ries in Lianhe Wan­bao, came up with the idea for the book and took it to the pub­lish­ers two years ago.</p>
    <p>For him, the pan­els tell the story not just of Sin­ga­pore’s hawk­ers, but also the coun­try’s de­vel­op­ment. The 1980s were when il­le­gal hawk­ers were re­moved from the streets and Chang’s de­tailed draw­ings cap­ture a slice of life that has dis­ap­peared.</p>
    <p>He said: “Many of the hawk­ers were drawn with bare feet, which shows how poor they were. It must have been tough walk­ing around the whole day with­out shoes.”</p>
    <p>He added: “There was also a lot of lost food. The a-ha mo­ment for me was real­is­ing that the name soon kueh was be­cause the snack was made with bam­boo shoot in the past. But now, it’s sub­sti­tuted with turnip.”</p>
    <p>Soon is Teochew for bam­boo shoot.</p>
    <p>He said the tough­est part of the trans­la­tion was fig­ur­ing out some of the things Chang was talk­ing about be­cause they do not ex­ist any­more.</p>
    <p>An ex­am­ple is the Chi­nese bagel, which was used to sand­wich a piece of braised meat like a ham­burger – ex­cept it has a hole in the mid­dle.</p>
    <p>It can be traced back to sol­diers in the Ming Dy­nasty who would string up a few buns with twine and hang them round their waist.</p>
    <p>He also wrote two es­says for the book. The first is an in­tro­duc­tion to Chang, who died in 1991 aged 72, with an anal­y­sis of his hawker draw­ings.</p>
    <p>The sec­ond, on the his­tory of hawker cen­tres in Sin­ga­pore, is cowrit­ten with Mr Lee Zhi Jie, his for­mer stu­dent who worked on a dis­ser­ta­tion on hawker cen­tres at the Na­tional Univer­sity of Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>Mr Lai’s re­search for the sec­ond es­say also un­earthed other in­ter­est­ing facts.</p>
    <p>For ex­am­ple, the first men­tion of a “shel­ter for hawk­ers” was made in 1908 in a pro­posal fol­low­ing a Sin­ga­pore San­i­ta­tion Com­mis­sion re­port. The old­est hawker cen­tre still in its orig­i­nal lo­ca­tion is the one in Balestier Road, which opened in 1929.</p>
    <p>The book is timely be­cause last year, Sin­ga­pore nom­i­nated its hawker cul­ture to be in­scribed on the United Na­tions Ed­u­ca­tional, Sci­en­tific and Cul­tural Or­gan­i­sa­tion’s (Unesco) Rep­re­sen­ta­tive List of the In­tan­gi­ble Cul­tural Her­itage of Hu­man­ity.</p>
    <p>The re­sult of the nom­i­na­tion will be an­nounced at Unesco’s an­nual</p>
    <p>In­ter­gov­ern­men­tal Com­mit­tee ses­sion next month.</p>
    <p>Mr Alvin Tan, NHB’s deputy chief ex­ec­u­tive (pol­icy & com­mu­nity), said: “The book is part of on­go­ing ef­forts to doc­u­ment Sin­ga­pore’s hawker cul­ture, and to com­mem­o­rate the nom­i­na­tion of hawker cul­ture for Unesco list­ing.</p>
    <p>“We de­cided to pub­lish the book to make the early his­tory of our hawker cul­ture more ac­ces­si­ble to the pub­lic, and more ap­peal­ing to a new gen­er­a­tion of read­ers. The book is tar­geted at both lo­cals and tourists who have tasted and fallen in love with our hawker fare.”</p>
    <p>His sen­ti­ments are echoed by Ms Mau­reen Ho, gen­eral man­ager of Fo­cus Pub­lish­ing, a con­tract pub­lish­ing arm of Sin­ga­pore Press Hold­ings.</p>
    <p>She said: “The book will con­trib­ute to­wards ef­forts to doc­u­ment and cel­e­brate hawker cul­ture in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>“We hope the book can also reach out to the non-Man­darin-speak­ing com­mu­nity on the rich cul­tural her­itage of Lianhe Wan­bao.”</p>
    <p>1920s-1930s Early Hawk­ers In Sin­ga­pore is avail­able on www.stbooks.sg for $30</p>
    <p>(in­clud­ing GST). It is also on sale at Books Ki­noku­niya, Times Book­stores, Pop­u­lar, Book­sAc­tu­ally and Lit­tered With Books.</p>
