    <p>(In­dia) • Mi­crosoft Corp said on Thurs­day it had trimmed its work­force across ge­ogra­phies and teams as it en­tered a new fis­cal year on July 1.</p>
    <p>The US soft­ware gi­ant de­clined to elab­o­rate on the roles which had been elim­i­nated, their num­bers or their lo­ca­tions.</p>
    <p>Busi­ness In­sider had re­ported that the firm cut un­der 1,000 jobs across its busi­ness this week. The com­pany cut roles at its on­line news por­tal MSN.com, as it shifted to an AI-pow­ered al­go­rith­mic feed, ac­cord­ing to the re­port, which added that jobs were also cut in the Mi­crosoft Azure cloud divi­sion.</p>
    <p>Last month, Mi­crosoft said it would close its re­tail stores and take a re­lated pre-tax as­set im­pair­ment charge of US$450 mil­lion (S$625.7 mil­lion) amid the pan­demic. A spokesman said it is com­mon for the firm to re-eval­u­ate its busi­ness as it en­ters a new fis­cal year.</p>
    <p>In 2017, the firm cut thou­sands of jobs around the same time as it un­der­went a re­or­gan­i­sa­tion that im­pacted its sales and mar­ket­ing teams.</p>
    <p>Late i n April, Mi­crosoft’s third-quar­ter re­sults beat Wall Street sales and profit ex­pec­ta­tions, pow­ered by sharp de­mand for its Teams chat and on­line meet­ing app and Xbox gam­ing ser­vices, as the world shifted to work­ing from home be­cause of the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Its rev­enue rose by 15 per cent to US$35.02 bil­lion in the third quar­ter while net in­come climbed to US$10.75 bil­lion, or US$1.40 per share.</p>
