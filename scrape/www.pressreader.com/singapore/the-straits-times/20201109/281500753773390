    <p>Re­searchers here have de­vel­oped a sim­u­la­tion which more ac­cu­rately mod­els the spread of droplets when a per­son with Covid-19 coughs in Sin­ga­pore’s tropical en­vi­ron­ment.</p>
    <p>The team from the Agency for Sci­ence, Tech­nol­ogy and Re­search’s (A*Star) In­sti­tute of High Per­for­mance Com­put­ing said now that they have the abil­ity to sim­u­late this, they are work­ing with pub­lic agen­cies to plan group size lim­its and safe man­age­ment mea­sures.</p>
    <p>The in­sti­tute’s ex­ec­u­tive direc­tor Lim Keng Hui told The Straits Times last Thurs­day that while other stud­ies had been done on the spread of cough droplets, they failed to take into ac­count fac­tors im­por­tant to Sin­ga­pore, start­ing with the cli­mate here.</p>
    <p>Dr Lim said: “Sin­ga­pore has a tropical cli­mate, which is why we use some of the en­vi­ron­men­tal con­di­tions of hu­mid­ity that match (lev­els) in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>“The trans­port of droplets in a tropical cli­mate will be quite dif­fer­ent from a tem­per­ate cli­mate, which would be drier.”</p>
    <p>Fel­low re­searcher Kang Chang Wei added that some pre­vi­ous stud­ies had also made as­sump­tions about droplets as they fly through the air, which did not ap­ply to Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>Dr Kang, who is a se­nior sci­en­tist at the in­sti­tute, said these other stud­ies ei­ther as­sume that a droplet will evap­o­rate com­pletely dur­ing its flight and dis­ap­pear, or not evap­o­rate at all.</p>
    <p>But in Sin­ga­pore’s hu­mid cli­mate, large cough droplets will evap­o­rate par­tially, leav­ing be­hind a smaller droplet – which can then be car­ried even far­ther by the wind.</p>
    <p>The sci­en­tists took these fac­tors into ac­count in their sim­u­la­tion, which was pub­lished in the jour­nal Physics Of Flu­ids last Tues­day.</p>
    <p>Work­ing closely with the Na­tional Su­per­com­put­ing Cen­tre, they fed a com­bi­na­tion of physics and math­e­mat­i­cal equa­tions, based on prior stud­ies on the coro­n­avirus, into a su­per­com­puter to pro­duce their sim­u­la­tion.</p>
    <p>The ac­cu­racy of the sim­u­la­tion was fur­ther ver­i­fied by A*Star’s In­sti­tute of Ma­te­ri­als Re­search and Engi­neer­ing, which used an aerosol gen­er­a­tor to recre­ate the sim­u­lated sce­nar­ios in real life.</p>
    <p>Among their many find­ings, the re­searchers dis­cov­ered that a 100 mi­crome­tre (μm) cough droplet can travel up to 6.6m at a wind speed of 2m per sec­ond, if the per­son who coughs is not wear­ing a mask.</p>
    <p>Although droplets of mul­ti­ple sizes are pro­duced when cough­ing, Dr Kang said 100μm is the av­er­age size of a droplet, and 2m per sec­ond is the av­er­age wind speed in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>The re­searchers added that in their sim­u­la­tion at present, Sin­ga­pore’s safe man­age­ment mea­sures are ef­fec­tive in mit­i­gat­ing the risk of Covid-19 spread.</p>
    <p>Dr Lim said: “Our re­search has shown sci­en­tific proof that it is very im­por­tant to wear a mask, prac­tise good per­sonal hy­giene, so­cial dis­tanc­ing, and en­sure the en­vi­ron­ment is well ven­ti­lated, as all these things help to col­lec­tively lower the risk of trans­mis­sion.”</p>
    <p>Dr Kang said that their model can be ap­plied to cre­ate a va­ri­ety of “what if” sce­nar­ios.</p>
    <p>This will help the au­thor­i­ties to more ac­cu­rately plan for safe man­age­ment mea­sures in the fu­ture, as they now have an ad­di­tional sci­en­tific tool to as­sess the risk of coro­n­avirus spread at an event.</p>
    <p>Added Dr Lim: “Now you’re able to know very pre­cisely... to re­ally un­der­stand the risk. That way, as you’re try­ing out var­i­ous safe dis­tanc­ing mea­sures such as (in­creas­ing) ca­pac­ity, we have a very sci­en­tific-based, quan­tifi­able, ev­i­dence­based ap­proach to de­sign them.”</p>
    <p>Dr Kang Chang Wei said some pre­vi­ous stud­ies ei­ther as­sume that a droplet will evap­o­rate com­pletely dur­ing its flight and dis­ap­pear, or not evap­o­rate at all. But in Sin­ga­pore’s hu­mid cli­mate, large cough droplets will evap­o­rate par­tially, leav­ing be­hind a smaller droplet – which can then be car­ried even far­ther by the wind.</p>
