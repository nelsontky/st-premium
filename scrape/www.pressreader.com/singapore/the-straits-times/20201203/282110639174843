    <p>The au­thor­i­ties are seek­ing feed­back on pro­posed changes to the law that would em­power the In­fo­comm Me­dia Devel­op­ment Au­thor­ity (IMDA) to in­stall and man­age the na­tion­wide par­cel locker net­work ahead of its planned roll-out next year, as well as set out rules re­lat­ing to its use.</p>
    <p>The sug­gested amend­ments to the Postal Ser­vices Act would al­low the IMDA to spell out of­fences, en­force the new rules and re­quire build­ing own­ers and de­vel­op­ers to pro­vide space for the lock­ers, among other things.</p>
    <p>This will sup­port the trans­for­ma­tion of Sin­ga­pore’s last-mile par­cel de­liv­ery in­fra­struc­ture amid a growth in e-com­merce and de­clin­ing mail vol­umes, the IMDA and Min­istry of Com­mu­ni­ca­tions and In­for­ma­tion (MCI) said in a state­ment yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The IMDA an­nounced in July that it would be ac­cel­er­at­ing the roll-out of the par­cel locker net­work by a year, with 1,000 locker sta­tions to be de­ployed across the is­land by the end of next year.</p>
    <p>Lock­ers in pub­lic res­i­den­tial ar­eas will be lo­cated within a five-minute walk or 250m of res­i­dents’ homes and com­ple­ment ex­ist­ing let­ter­boxes.</p>
    <p>The pro­posed changes to the law would ex­pand the postal reg­u­la­tor’s over­sight to in­clude the par­cel locker net­work.</p>
    <p>This would al­low the IMDA to in­stall, own and op­er­ate the net­work at spec­i­fied places, in­clud­ing com­mon ar­eas in hous­ing es­tates, pub­lic trans­port fa­cil­i­ties and com­mu­nity cen­tres.</p>
    <p>The pro­vi­sion, main­te­nance and ac­cess to these spa­ces are in­tended to be pro­vided at the owner or de­vel­oper’s own ex­pense, the au­thor­i­ties said in a pub­lic con­sul­ta­tion paper pub­lished yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Nec­es­sary spa­ces must be able to be se­cured and ac­cessed for in­stal­la­tion and main­te­nance to en­sure res­i­dents ben­e­fit from hav­ing pub­lic par­cel lock­ers near their homes, the IMDA and MCI said.</p>
    <p>Ex­ist­ing par­cel lock­ers run by pri­vate sec­tor op­er­a­tors are largely con­cen­trated in com­mer­cial ar­eas with high foot­fall, leav­ing most parts of the res­i­den­tial mar­ket un­der­served, they added.</p>
    <p>The new rules would also al­low the IMDA to spec­ify of­fences re­lat­ing to the use of the net­work and pro­vide it with en­force­ment pow­ers.</p>
    <p>This would in­clude the power to in­ves­ti­gate any un­safe use of the net­work, such as the plac­ing of ob­jects in pub­lic par­cel lock­ers which are con­trary to pub­lic safety and se­cu­rity, the au­thor­i­ties said.</p>
    <p>Such items may also be de­tained and ex­am­ined, sim­i­lar to rules gov­ern­ing the postal ser­vice.</p>
    <p>The IMDA said ear­lier this year that it would be in­cor­po­rat­ing a wholly owned sub­sidiary, Pick Net­work, to de­ploy and op­er­ate the locker net­work.</p>
    <p>Pick will en­sure a fair al­lo­ca­tion of lock­ers to com­pet­ing lo­gis­tics ser­vice providers, the au­thor­i­ties said.</p>
    <p>In Septem­ber, the I MDA awarded a ten­der for the sup­ply, de­liv­ery, in­stal­la­tion, sup­port and main­te­nance of the par­cel locker net­work to ST Elec­tron­ics (Info-Comm Sys­tems) and Pana­sonic Asia-Pa­cific.</p>
    <p>The two firms beat out 13 other bid­ders, in­clud­ing Sin­ga­pore Post.</p>
    <p>Those who wish to give feed­back on the pro­posed amend­ments to the Postal Ser­vices Act may do so by e-mail­ing postal­reg­u­la­tion@mci.gov.sg be­fore 6pm on Dec 23.</p>
