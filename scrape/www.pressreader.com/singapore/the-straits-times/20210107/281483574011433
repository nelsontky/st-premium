    <p>Dis­grun­tled over not get­ting an ex­tra al­lowance for send­ing a three-year-old girl to school, a driver left the child strapped to her seat in his locked van with­out ven­ti­la­tion at a carpark for more than an hour in Jan­u­ary last year.</p>
    <p>Zulka­h­nai Haron, 47, went to buy food and gro­ceries be­fore head­ing home.</p>
    <p>The girl was later found sob­bing and call­ing out for her mother by a cou­ple who alerted the school.</p>
    <p>Shaken by the in­ci­dent, the vic­tim suf­fered from post-trau­matic stress disor­der. She can­not be iden­ti­fied as she is below 18 years old.</p>
    <p>For ill-treat­ing the girl, Zulka­h­nai was sen­tenced to 10 months’ jail yes­ter­day. He was also fined $3,000 and dis­qual­i­fied from driv­ing for 12 months for a sep­a­rate traf­fic of­fence on April 10 last year.</p>
    <p>Zulka­h­nai was work­ing as a mini­van driver for a trans­port ser­vices com­pany when he com­mit­ted his of­fence on Jan 20.</p>
    <p>On that day, he had com­pleted his duty of driv­ing stu­dents to their schools when his su­per­vi­sor asked him to take two more stu­dents, in­clud­ing the girl.</p>
    <p>Af­ter pick­ing up the stu­dents, Zulka­h­nai asked the su­per­vi­sor if he would get an ex­tra al­lowance for the ex­tra trips.</p>
    <p>“The ac­cused left the dis­cus­sion feel­ing un­happy as he did not re­ceive a sat­is­fac­tory an­swer from his su­per­vi­sor,” said Deputy Pub­lic Pros­e­cu­tor Colin Ng. Zulka­h­nai then dropped off the boy stu­dent at his school, and told the bus at­ten­dant of the mini­van that she could go home for the day, while the vic­tim was still in the ve­hi­cle.</p>
    <p>“In do­ing so, the ac­cused was act­ing con­trary to his com­pany’s pol­icy, which dic­tates that bus at­ten­dants are per­mit­ted to leave the van only af­ter all stu­dents have alighted,” said DPP Ng.</p>
    <p>Af­ter the bus at­ten­dant left the ve­hi­cle, Zulka­h­nai de­cided to head home in­stead of send­ing the vic­tim to her school. At about 9am, he parked the mini­van in a multi-storey carpark at Block 358A Ad­mi­ralty Drive, turned off the en­gine, and locked the ve­hi­cle.</p>
    <p>The court heard that he did so de­spite know­ing that the girl was still in the mini­van with her safety belt strapped on.</p>
    <p>Zulka­h­nai then went to buy food at a stall and gro­ceries at a su­per­mar­ket be­fore head­ing home.</p>
    <p>The girl was dis­cov­ered in tears by a woman and her hus­band about an hour later.</p>
    <p>The woman called the child’s school prin­ci­pal, while her hus­band con­tacted Zulka­h­nai.</p>
    <p>The driver ar­rived at the scene about 10 min­utes later. He then</p>
    <p>drove the girl, ac­com­pa­nied by the woman, to her school. The woman later re­counted the in­ci­dent to the vic­tim’s teacher.</p>
    <p>Zulka­h­nai ini­tially told the po­lice that he had a tummy upset at the ma­te­rial time, soiled his trousers and gone home to change his clothes.</p>
    <p>He main­tained this ac­count un­til he was shown the closed-cir­cuit tele­vi­sion footage of him at the su­per­mar­ket, DPP Ng said.</p>
    <p>The DPP added that the child’s mother re­ported that the girl was scared of be­ing alone and was un­able to sleep with­out her for about six months af­ter the in­ci­dent.</p>
    <p>The child had told her mother that she did not want to “take the school bus” as she was afraid she might be left alone again in the ve­hi­cle, the court heard.</p>
    <p>In sen­tenc­ing Zulka­h­nai, District Judge Marvin Bay said there was an “egre­gious abuse of trust” by the man.</p>
    <p>“Alone and re­strained in the un</p>
    <p>ven­ti­lated van, the three-year-old child would be at risk of oxy­gen de­pri­va­tion (if left long enough), heat stress or even phys­i­cal in­jury if she had strug­gled to free her­self from her seat belt re­straints,” he added.</p>
    <p>Zulka­h­nai’s lawyer Sofia Ben­nita Mo­hamed Bakhash said in mit­i­ga­tion that her client was fac­ing fi­nan­cial dif­fi­cul­ties at the time of his of­fences and had dif­fi­culty con­cen­trat­ing.</p>
    <p>The lawyer also said a jail sen­tence would im­pact his fam­ily life as his wife was un­able to sup­port their two chil­dren on her own with her salary.</p>
    <p>The judge granted Zulka­h­nai’s re­quest to de­fer his jail sen­tence to Jan 20 so that he can set­tle his fam­ily and em­ploy­ment mat­ters.</p>
    <p>For ill-treat­ing the child, Zulka­h­nai could have been jailed for up to eight years and/or fined up to $8,000.</p>
