    <p>MID­DLE­TOWN (Cal­i­for­nia) • Thun­der­storms rum­bled over north­ern Cal­i­for­nia again but the fire-rav­aged re­gion around San Fran­cisco Bay was largely spared from a new on­slaught of in­cen­di­ary light­ning strikes like those that sparked hun­dreds of blazes last week.</p>
    <p>Fire­fight­ing crews al­ready stretched to their lim­its had braced them­selves for an­other po­ten­tially cat­a­strophic spate of dry light­ning on Sun­day and Monday, as fore­cast­ers for the Na­tional Weather Ser­vice pre­dicted.</p>
    <p>But rather than the thou­sands of light­ning strikes that were feared, the re­gion saw a few hun­dred, while cloudy skies, cooler tem­per­a­tures and ris­ing hu­mid­ity pro­vided a wel­come respite that helped fire crews con­sol­i­date some gains they made over the week­end.</p>
    <p>Still, the squall of mon­ster-size wild­fires – in­clud­ing the sec­on­dand third-largest on record in Cal­i­for­nia – re­mained far from un­der con­trol, with some 240,000 peo­ple un­der evacuation or­ders or warn­ings across the state.</p>
    <p>Re­tired nurse Rebecca Pledger, 64, from the Lake County com­mu­nity of Mid­dle­town, about 145km north of San Fran­cisco, said she and her hus­band chose to dis­re­gard evacuation or­ders for the time be­ing, hop­ing their home would be spared as they stayed put to at­tend to their chick­ens, horse and dogs.</p>
    <p>Much of north­ern Cal­i­for­nia, from the Sierra Ne­vada Moun­tains to the Pa­cific Coast, re­mained un­der a “red flag” alert for ex­treme fire haz­ards on Monday.</p>
    <p>Close to 300 light­ning strikes sparked 10 blazes on Sun­day night into Monday morn­ing, and more “sleeper fires” were likely smoul­der­ing as yet undis­cov­ered in ar­eas shrouded by dense smoke, Gov­er­nor Gavin New­som said.</p>
    <p>“We are in a dif­fer­ent cli­mate and we are deal­ing with dif­fer­ent cli­mate con­di­tions that are pre­cip­i­tat­ing fires the likes of which we have not seen in mod­ern recorded his­tory,” Mr New­som told a news brief­ing on Monday.</p>
    <p>Wild­fires ig­nited by more than 13,000 light­ning strikes all across north­ern and cen­tral Cal­i­for­nia since Aug 15 have killed at least seven peo­ple and de­stroyed over 1,200 homes and other struc­tures.</p>
    <p>In to­tal, the blazes have charred nearly 500,000ha, an area more</p>
