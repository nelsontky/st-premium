    <p>The Straits Times’ Sin­ga­pore editor Zakir Hus­sain noted that the pan­demic can be seen as an op­por­tu­nity to fun­da­men­tally change the way we view men­tal well­ness (When cri­sis un­der­lines the need for change, Sept 27).</p>
    <p>He called for, among other things, more pre­ven­tive ac­tion and “plac­ing lived ex­pe­ri­ence at the heart of men­tal health­care”.</p>
    <p>I pro­pose we also re­view the vo­cab­u­lary we use when dis­cussing men­tal health. This would go a long way to­wards ad­dress­ing the stigma associated with men­tal health­care.</p>
    <p>First, peo­ple seek­ing coun­selling should be called clients and not pa­tients. Men­tal health is a continuum and not all is­sues faced by peo­ple are med­i­cal in na­ture.</p>
    <p>Some­times, talk ther­apy with a coun­sel­lor or psy­chol­o­gist is more ap­pro­pri­ate than get­ting medication from a psy­chi­a­trist (a doc­tor spe­cial­is­ing in the treat­ment of men­tal dis­or­ders).</p>
    <p>Call­ing those who seek such help clients could help per­suade some­one to get pro­fes­sional sup­port.</p>
    <p>Many peo­ple with men­tal health is­sues are re­luc­tant to seek help be­cause they wrongly be­lieve that only peo­ple with se­ri­ous dis­or­ders need to do so.</p>
    <p>Sec­ond, those who end their own lives are com­monly said to have “com­mit­ted sui­cide”. The phrase de­scribes the event like a crime and sug­gests the in­di­vid­ual shoul­ders some blame for it.</p>
    <p>While Sin­ga­pore de­crim­i­nalised at­tempted sui­cide ear­lier this year, our vo­cab­u­lary around it has yet to change.</p>
    <p>The lit­mus test for talk­ing about sui­cide is to sub­sti­tute the word “can­cer” for “sui­cide”. We wouldn’t say some­one com­mit­ted can­cer. We would sim­ply say he died of can­cer.</p>
    <p>Peo­ple with men­tal health is­sues have far more sides to them than their con­di­tion. To ac­cept some­one as a per­son first is not only more re­spect­ful, but also ac­knowl­edges that there is more to him be­yond his di­ag­no­sis.</p>
    <p>We shouldn’t say, for ex­am­ple, that some­one is bipo­lar. In­stead, we should just describe him as liv­ing with the con­di­tion.</p>
    <p>Re­cently, I was heart­ened to hear Tan­jong Pa­gar GRC MP Alvin Tan, in his maiden par­lia­men­tary speech, de­fine men­tal health broadly.</p>
    <p>He al­luded to the fact that the con­di­tions can of­ten be tem­po­rary in na­ture by re­fer­ring to them as “men­tal ail­ments” or “men­tal in­juries”.</p>
    <p>Mr Tan was also up­front about the big­gest bar­rier that peo­ple face in seek­ing help over their men­tal health – shame.</p>
    <p>A bet­ter vo­cab­u­lary would go some way to chang­ing this.</p>
