    <p>Sin­ga­pore’s Covid-19 vac­ci­na­tion ex­er­cise will be­gin on Wed­nes­day with health­care work­ers at the Na­tional Cen­tre for In­fec­tious Diseases (NCID), fol­lowed by those from other health­care in­sti­tu­tions in the com­ing weeks.</p>
    <p>Se­niors aged 70 and above will get vac­ci­nated from Fe­bru­ary next year, said the Min­istry of Health (MOH) in a state­ment yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>This is in line with rec­om­men­da­tions by an ex­pert com­mit­tee that front-line and health­care work­ers, as well as those most vul­ner­a­ble to se­vere com­pli­ca­tions if they con­tract Covid-19, should be vac­ci­nated first, the min­istry said.</p>
    <p>The Gov­ern­ment has ac­cepted in full the rec­om­men­da­tions sub­mit­ted last Thurs­day by the Ex­pert Com­mit­tee on Covid-19 Vac­ci­na­tion on Sin­ga­pore’s over­all vac­cine strat­egy, MOH added.</p>
    <p>Pub­lic health­care in­sti­tu­tions and pri­vate hos­pi­tals are to ar­range for their staff to be vac­ci­nated at their re­spec­tive premises.</p>
    <p>Se­niors aged 70 and up will get pri­or­ity for vac­cines as they tend to have worse health out­comes than those aged 60 to 69, MOH said.</p>
    <p>There­after, MOH will vac­ci­nate other Sin­ga­pore­ans and long-term res­i­dents who are el­i­gi­ble.</p>
    <p>“Vac­ci­na­tion is not a sil­ver bul­let that can end the pan­demic im­me­di­ately, but it is a key en­abler to get­ting us back to a safer state of af­fairs,” the min­istry said.</p>
    <p>Vac­ci­na­tion will com­ple­ment other “key en­ablers” such as test­ing and con­tact trac­ing to mit­i­gate any spread and keep com­mu­nity trans­mis­sion low, MOH noted, stress­ing that only vac­cines that meet strict stan­dards of safety, qual­ity and ef­fec­tive­ness will be used.</p>
    <p>The an­nounce­ment comes as Sin­ga­pore moves into the third phase of its re­open­ing to­day, nearly six months af­ter the coun­try ex­ited its cir­cuit breaker pe­riod on June 1.</p>
    <p>At­trac­tions such as Gar­dens by the Bay and the Sin­ga­pore Zoo have geared up for an in­crease in vis­i­tors as ca­pac­ity lim­its are raised to 65 per cent of their full op­er­at­ing ca­pac­ity, up from 50 per cent.</p>
    <p>Groups of up to eight peo­ple can now gather so­cially, up from a limit of five, prompt­ing restau­rants to make changes to their lay­outs to ac­com­mo­date larger groups.</p>
    <p>The risk of more im­ported cases and com­mu­nity spread will in­crease as Sin­ga­pore moves into phase three, said MOH. Get­ting vac­ci­nated “is es­pe­cially im­por­tant in the face of re­ports sur­fac­ing glob­ally about more trans­mis­si­ble strains”, the min­istry added.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, the ex­pert com­mit­tee re­leased its rec­om­men­da­tions, in­clud­ing its as­sess­ment that the Pfizer-BioNTech vac­cine is suit­able for use in peo­ple aged 16 and above.</p>
    <p>Preg­nant women and im­muno­com­pro­mised in­di­vid­u­als should not get the vac­cine un­til more in­for­ma­tion is avail­able, it added.</p>
    <p>The com­mit­tee rec­om­mended that ev­ery­one liv­ing in Sin­ga­pore who is med­i­cally el­i­gi­ble should be vac­ci­nated when vac­cines be­come more widely avail­able, although it should re­main vol­un­tary.</p>
    <p>At any time, about 5 per cent of avail­able vac­cine stocks should be re­served for spe­cific groups of peo­ple who are crit­i­cal to keep­ing the coun­try going, like those work­ing in es­sen­tial ser­vices, it said.</p>
    <p>Mea­sures such as mask wear­ing and so­cial dis­tanc­ing should con­tinue, it added, un­til more in­for­ma­tion is avail­able on the vac­cines’ abil­ity to pre­vent in­fec­tions.</p>
    <p>The com­mit­tee’s chair­man, As­so­ci­ate Pro­fes­sor Ben­jamin Ong, said that while Sin­ga­pore cur­rently has a low rate of lo­cal trans­mis­sion of Covid-19, it re­mains vul­ner­a­ble to the threat of a surge in cases. It is thus key to vac­ci­nate as much of the pop­u­la­tion as pos­si­ble.</p>
    <p>“We strongly en­cour­age all per­sons who are med­i­cally el­i­gi­ble to be vac­ci­nated when the vac­cine is made avail­able to them,” he said.</p>
