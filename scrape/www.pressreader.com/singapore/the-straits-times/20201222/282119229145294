    <p>Gen­der-re­lated con­tent taught by schools and higher learn­ing in­sti­tu­tions will be more stan­dard­ised, and the Min­istry of Ed­u­ca­tion (MOE) will work with them to share re­sources on such top­ics.</p>
    <p>Min­is­ter of State for Ed­u­ca­tion and So­cial and Fam­ily De­vel­op­ment Sun Xuel­ing said yes­ter­day that the var­i­ous in­sti­tutes of higher learn­ing (IHLs) cur­rently have their own cur­ric­ula on re­spect and bound­aries for stu­dents and staff.</p>
    <p>“What the MOE hopes to do is to work with the IHLs closely to en­sure greater stan­dard­i­s­a­tion of the mod­ules that are used, and also to share re­sources... and to look at the cases that have come up and to also stan­dard­ise the pro­to­cols and our re­sponses to is­sues that arise.”</p>
    <p>Ms Sun was speak­ing to the me­dia af­ter a vir­tual en­gage­ment ses­sion or­gan­ised by MOE and the Na­tional Youth Coun­cil.</p>
    <p>The ses­sion in­volved about 100 IHL stu­dents and fo­cused on the is­sues that women face in schools.</p>
    <p>This is the first such con­ver­sa­tion with stu­dents from higher learn­ing in­sti­tu­tions, as part of a na­tional re­view of is­sues which af­fect women that was an­nounced in Septem­ber.</p>
    <p>The ideas and sug­ges­tions gath­ered through th­ese di­a­logues, which started in Oc­to­ber, will form the ba­sis of a White Pa­per to be tabled in Par­lia­ment in the first half of next year.</p>
    <p>In her re­marks af­ter yes­ter­day’s ses­sion, Ms Sun, who is co-lead­ing the re­view with Min­is­ter of State for Cul­ture, Com­mu­nity and Youth and Trade and In­dus­try Low Yen Ling and Par­lia­men­tary Sec­re­tary for Health Ra­hayu Mahzam, said: “What re­ally stuck in my mind was that our stu­dents have ex­pressed a deep de­sire to have a cul­ture of re­spect be­tween the gen­ders.”</p>
    <p>Ms Sun noted that as part of the</p>
    <p>up­dated char­ac­ter and cit­i­zen­ship ed­u­ca­tion (CCE) cur­ricu­lum that will kick in next year, there will be greater em­pha­sis on mo­ral val­ues, cy­ber well­ness and re­spect­ing bound­aries for self and oth­ers both on­line and off­line.</p>
    <p>Other top­ics raised yes­ter­day in­cluded the need to pro­vide a safe en­vi­ron­ment for young peo­ple, in the con­text of re­cent sex­ual mis­con­duct cases in uni­ver­si­ties.</p>
    <p>This in­cludes equip­ping stu­dents with “age-ap­pro­pri­ate knowl­edge, so that they know how to pro­tect them­selves against on­line sex­ual groom­ing, sex­ual ha­rass­ment, sex­ual abuse, and also how to recog­nise in­ap­pro­pri­ate be­hav­iour, and to un­der­stand the le­gal con­se­quences and so­cio-emo­tional im­pact that such of­fences can have”, said Ms Sun.</p>
    <p>She said the re­freshed CCE cur­ricu­lum will ad­dress the key chal­lenges that youth to­day face, for in­stance, on so­cial me­dia.</p>
    <p>On­line sex­ual groom­ing, abuse of teacher-stu­dent re­la­tion­ships and voyeurism are some of the min­istry’s con­cerns, she said, and the cur­ricu­lum uses sce­nar­ios to help stu­dents know what to do.</p>
    <p>One ex­am­ple is a tu­ition teacher who be­haves in­ap­pro­pri­ately with a child. In such a les­son, the teach­ers would share what stu­dents need to do, so they know how to re­act in such sit­u­a­tions, Ms Sun said.</p>
    <p>The stu­dents also shared con­cerns about gen­der stereo­types in pro­fes­sions like nurs­ing and how th­ese could af­fect the types of ca­reers young peo­ple go into.</p>
    <p>Ms Sun said that through ed­u­ca­tion and ca­reer guid­ance in schools, MOE will en­sure that stu­dents can ex­plore a va­ri­ety of path­ways and ad­dress gen­der-based bi­ases that may limit their as­pi­ra­tions.</p>
    <p>“Stu­dents should look at their in­nate qual­i­ties, what their strengths are, and not be im­peded by men­tal mod­els of what they think,” she said, adding that schools will also help to bring about greater aware­ness of gen­der equal­ity at home through CCE.</p>
    <p>“Stu­dents will learn to ap­pre­ci­ate eq­uity of par­ent­ing roles, re­gard­less of gen­der, and the im­por­tance of not as­crib­ing gen­der stereo­types in par­ent­ing.</p>
    <p>“At the end of the day, we want to nur­ture pos­i­tive mind­sets and at­ti­tudes to­wards the eq­uity of roles in the fam­ily, start­ing from a young age.”</p>
