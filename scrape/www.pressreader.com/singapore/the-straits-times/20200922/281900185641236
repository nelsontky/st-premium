    <p>MANILA • When Amer­i­can big wave surfer Doug Fal­ter lost his board in a wipe­out in Hawaii, his best hope was for a lo­cal fish­er­man to pick it up.</p>
    <p>He never imag­ined it would be found more than 8,000km away in the south­ern Philip­pines.</p>
    <p>More than two years af­ter watch­ing his pale blue cus­tom-shaped board dis­ap­pear in the huge swell of Waimea Bay, Mr Fal­ter was alerted via so­cial me­dia that it had been found near the re­mote is­land of Sarangani.</p>
    <p>And the new owner – lo­cal pri­mary school teacher and as­pir­ing surfer Gio­vanne Branzuela – was happy to give it back to him.</p>
    <p>“When I saw the pic­ture of it, I couldn’t be­lieve it, I thought it was a joke al­most,” Mr Fal­ter, 35, told Agence France-Presse via Zoom. “I was cer­tain that the board would never be found again.”</p>
    <p>Mr Branzuela, who bought the badly weath­ered surf­board from his neigh­bour a cou­ple of months ago for 2,000 pe­sos (S$56), said fish­er­men had found it float­ing in the sea in Au­gust 2018 – six months af­ter Mr Fal­ter lost sight of it. They thought it may have fallen off a pass­ing yacht and sold it to Mr Branzuela’s neigh­bour for a few dol­lars.</p>
    <p>De­spite months drift­ing across the Pa­cific Ocean, the name of the board’s shaper, Hawaii-based Lyle Carl­son, was still vis­i­ble on the now-yel­low­ish sur­face.</p>
    <p>Cu­ri­ous, Mr Branzuela looked him up on Facebook and sent him a photo of the board.</p>
    <p>Mr Carl­son shared the pic­ture on Instagram, tag­ging Mr Fal­ter.</p>
    <p>“It turned out it’s a surf­board from Hawaii. I couldn’t be­lieve it my­self,” Mr Branzuela, 38, said.</p>
    <p>“It’s been my dream to learn to surf and ride the big waves here,” he added. “For now I can use his surf­board. I told him I will take good care of it.”</p>
    <p>The pair have been chat­ting on Facebook and Mr Fal­ter plans to visit the small is­land to re­trieve his board af­ter coro­n­avirus travel re­stric­tions are lifted.</p>
    <p>“That board meant so much to me be­cause of my ac­com­plish­ments on it,” said Mr Fal­ter, a com­mer­cial pho­tog­ra­pher who took up surf­ing about 15 years ago in Florida be­fore mov­ing to Hawaii.</p>
    <p>“It was my first big wave surf­board cus­tom-shaped for my­self. I surfed it on the biggest days I’ve ever surfed in my life,” he said, in­clud­ing the 2016 Ed­die Aikau big wave surf con­test in Waimea Bay when the swell was 20m high.</p>
    <p>Mr Fal­ter said he wants to give Mr Branzuela a begin­ners’ surf­board in ex­change for his and show him how to catch waves around Sarangani and neigh­bour­ing Ba­lut is­land.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, Mr Fal­ter shares YouTube videos on surf­ing ba­sics and is rais­ing money to send sup­plies to Mr Branzuela’s school.</p>
    <p>“It’s an ex­cuse for me to go to the Philip­pines and visit and ba­si­cally com­plete the story,” said Mr Fal­ter. “I think it would be a great end­ing, to... teach him how to surf.”</p>
