    <p>Hong Kong’s leg­is­la­ture will have no op­po­si­tion law­mak­ers if mem­bers of the pan-demo­cratic camp follow through on their threat to re­sign en masse to­day, adding to grow­ing fears that Bei­jing wants to crush dis­sent and cre­ate a rub­ber-stamp Par­lia­ment.</p>
    <p>This comes af­ter China’s top leg­isla­tive body passed a res­o­lu­tion yes­ter­day re­quir­ing Hong Kong law­mak­ers to be pa­tri­ots, widely viewed as a move to curb de­bate in a city that man­aged to thrive on it.</p>
    <p>The res­o­lu­tion of the Na­tional Peo­ple’s Congress Stand­ing Com­mit­tee (NPCSC) states that leg­is­la­tors who pro­mote or sup­port Hong Kong in­de­pen­dence, refuse to ac­knowl­edge China’s sovereignt­y over Hong Kong, ask ex­ter­nal forces to in­ter­fere in the ter­ri­tory’s af­fairs or com­mit other acts that threaten na­tional se­cu­rity should be dis­qual­i­fied.</p>
    <p>Cit­ing the need for a smooth im­ple­men­ta­tion of the “one coun­try, two sys­tems” prin­ci­ple and longterm sta­bil­ity in Hong Kong, it said all public ser­vants in the city – in­clud­ing law­mak­ers – must sup­port the Ba­sic Law – and be loyal to the Hong Kong gov­ern­ment.</p>
    <p>NPCSC chair­man Li Zhan­shu said at the close of a two-day meet­ing that Bei­jing’s de­ci­sion is “con­ducive to the long-term peace and sta­bil­ity, as well as pros­per­ity and de­vel­op­ment of Hong Kong”.</p>
    <p>The de­ci­sion ap­plies not only to fu­ture law­mak­ers but also to four pan-demo­cratic law­mak­ers who were barred from run­ning in the Leg­isla­tive Coun­cil (Legco) elec­tions, post­poned from Septem­ber till next year.</p>
    <p>The Hong Kong gov­ern­ment an­nounced the dis­qual­i­fi­ca­tion of Mr Alvin Ye­ung, Mr Den­nis Kwok, Mr Kwok Ka Ki and Mr Ken­neth Le­ung, with Chief Ex­ec­u­tive Car­rie Lam en­dors­ing the de­ci­sion.</p>
    <p>The Hong Kong and Ma­cau Af­fairs Of­fice said the dis­qual­i­fi­ca­tion “has a solid le­gal foun­da­tion and has an un­de­ni­able au­thor­ity”.</p>
    <p>The Legco has been plagued by bit­ter­ness be­tween the pan-demo­cratic and pro-es­tab­lish­ment camps, with fil­i­bus­ter­ing and cham­ber drama aris­ing sev­eral times in at least the past year.</p>
    <p>“I have taken the re­spon­si­bil­ity to seek a so­lu­tion to ad­dress this prob­lem,” said Mrs Lam, who said Hong Kong plans to in­tro­duce leg­is­la­tion to for­malise the process and spell out le­gal con­se­quences for vi­o­la­tors.</p>
    <p>Demo­cratic Party chair­man Wu Chi Wai said yes­ter­day that the re­main­ing 15 op­po­si­tion law­mak­ers will hand in their res­ig­na­tion let­ters to­day – a move the pan-demo­cratic bloc had warned of on Mon­day if any of them were to be dis­qual­i­fied.</p>
    <p>He noted that as early as 2014, Bei­jing had an­nounced in a White Pa­per that it would ex­tend its ju­ris­dic­tion over Hong Kong com­pletely.</p>
    <p>“There is a sep­a­ra­tion of power un­der the stip­u­la­tion of the Ba­sic Law, but to­day, the de­ci­sion made by the cen­tral gov­ern­ment sim­ply says that all the sep­a­ra­tion of power will be taken away, and all the power will be cen­tralised in the Chief Ex­ec­u­tive.</p>
    <p>“Of course, the Chief Ex­ec­u­tive is a pup­pet of the cen­tral gov­ern­ment... We say that to­day is the end of the ‘one coun­try, two sys­tems’ (prin­ci­ple),” said Mr Wu.</p>
    <p>Legco pres­i­dent An­drew Le­ung dis­missed the no­tion that the de­ci­sion cre­ates a rub­ber-stamp leg­is­la­ture, say­ing: “Do you think the pro­gov­ern­ment camp is one party? They have a lot more dif­fer­ent voices... With­out the pan-dems, we might have more op­po­si­tion from the pro-gov­ern­ment camp than any­one.”</p>
    <p>As­so­ci­ate Pro­fes­sor Al­fred Wu of the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Pol­icy noted that even if the pan­democrats were to stay on, the op­po­si­tion bloc would not be able to veto the pass­ing of mea­sures with the dis­qual­i­fi­ca­tion of the four law­mak­ers.</p>
    <p>“It’s very clear that Hong Kong law­mak­ers have be­come a rub­ber stamp since all of them are pro-gov­ern­ment,” he said.</p>
    <p>Mr Lau Siu Kai, vice-pres­i­dent of the Chi­nese As­so­ci­a­tion of Hong Kong and Ma­cau Stud­ies, noted that the chaos in Hong Kong’s Legco has meant that it could not func­tion and the gov­ern­ment is stuck in a quandary. This sit­u­a­tion prompted Bei­jing to act, he said.</p>
    <p>“If the op­po­si­tion leaves, re­la­tions within the Legco will im­prove in the year that fol­lows and ma­jor poli­cies deal­ing with dif­fer­ent crises can be pushed through quickly. The gov­ern­ment and the pro-Bei­jing camp will have to ac­count for the success or failure of those poli­cies, so they are likely to move cau­tiously ahead.”</p>
    <p>Bri­tish For­eign Sec­re­tary Do­minic Raab said the ex­pul­sion of the four law­mak­ers con­sti­tuted an as­sault on Hong Kong’s free­doms as set out in the UK-China Joint Dec­la­ra­tion.</p>
    <p>“This cam­paign to ha­rass, sti­fle and dis­qual­ify demo­cratic op­po­si­tion tar­nishes China’s in­ter­na­tional rep­u­ta­tion and un­der­mines Hong Kong’s long-term sta­bil­ity,” he said yes­ter­day in a state­ment.</p>
    <p>If the op­po­si­tion leaves, re­la­tions within the Legco will im­prove in the year that fol­lows and ma­jor poli­cies deal­ing with dif­fer­ent crises can be pushed through quickly. The gov­ern­ment and the pro-Bei­jing camp will have to ac­count for the success or failure of those poli­cies, so they are likely to move cau­tiously ahead.</p>
