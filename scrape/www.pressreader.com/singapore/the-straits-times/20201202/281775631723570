    <p>NEW YORK • The coro­n­avirus pan­demic is push­ing the num­ber of peo­ple world­wide who need hu­man­i­tar­ian as­sis­tance to sur­vive to new highs, the United Na­tions said yes­ter­day, dra­mat­i­cally in­creas­ing the ranks of ex­treme poverty in just one year.</p>
    <p>One in 33 peo­ple will need aid to meet ba­sic needs like food, water and san­i­ta­tion in 2021, a rise of 40 per cent from this year, said the</p>
    <p>UN’s Global Hu­man­i­tar­ian Overview 2021. That is 235 mil­lion peo­ple world­wide, with con­cen­tra­tions in Afghanista­n, Ye­men, Syria, the Demo­cratic Repub­lic of Congo and Ethiopia, it said.</p>
    <p>“The cri­sis is far from over,” said UN Sec­re­tary-Gen­eral An­to­nio Guter­res in a state­ment. “Hu­man­i­tar­ian aid bud­gets face dire short­falls as the im­pact of the global pan­demic con­tin­ues to worsen.”</p>
    <p>The re­port said coun­tries gave a record US$17 bil­lion (S$22.8 bil­lion) this year for col­lec­tive hu­man­i­tar­ian re­sponse, reach­ing 70 per cent of the peo­ple tar­geted for aid, a rise of 6 per cent com­pared with last year. But the UN warned that it has raised less than half of the US$35 bil­lion needed to stave off wide­spread famine, fight poverty and keep chil­dren in school and called on the world’s wealthy coun­tries for fi­nan­cial con­tri­bu­tions.</p>
    <p>“The rich world can now see the light at the end of the tun­nel,” said UN hu­man­i­tar­ian chief Mark Low­cock in a state­ment. “The same is not true in the poor­est coun­tries.”</p>
    <p>Coun­tries around the world had made steady ad­vances since the 1990s in re­duc­ing ex­treme poverty – de­fined by the World Bank, a mul­ti­lat­eral de­vel­op­ment lender, as liv­ing on US$1.90 a day or less. The UN’s cal­cu­la­tions show one in 33 peo­ple need­ing as­sis­tance com­pared with one in 45 peo­ple this year, al­ready the high­est fig­ure in decades, it said.</p>
    <p>School clo­sures have af­fected nine out of 10 stu­dents world­wide, with al­most 24 mil­lion chil­dren at risk of not re­turn­ing to school this year, the UN said.</p>
    <p>And as the pan­demic im­pedes on food sys­tems, hunger is on the rise, and the UN pro­jected that by the end of the year, as many as 270 mil­lion peo­ple will lack re­li­able ac­cess to food. The cost of meet­ing food aid needs this year was US$9 bil­lion, up from US$5 bil­lion in 2015, the re­port said.</p>
    <p>The coro­n­avirus has al­ready in­fected 62.6 mil­lion peo­ple and killed 1.46 mil­lion peo­ple world­wide, ac­cord­ing to a Reuters tally.</p>
