    <p>Guests of the first vir­tual Na­tional Day Is­tana Open House were treated to lit­tle nuggets of his­tory on one of Sin­ga­pore’s old­est her­itage sites yes­ter­day, with a “speak­ing” cheese plate as their host.</p>
    <p>This is no or­di­nary plate – the Gov­ern­ment House prop­erty was be­lieved to have been used in the 1930s and the 1950s, play­ing host, al­beit a silent one then, to for­eign dig­ni­taries and guests. It is still serv­ing the nation to­day, as one of the arte­facts on dis­play at the Na­tional Mu­seum of Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>In her open­ing com­ments dur­ing the vir­tual open house, which was hosted on Face­book and In­sta­gram, Pres­i­dent Hal­imah Ya­cob said that de­spite the coro­n­avirus pan­demic, it was im­por­tant to al­low Sin­ga­pore­ans the op­por­tu­nity to visit the Is­tana, even if they could not phys­i­cally be on site, with ac­tiv­i­ties for the pub­lic to learn more about the Is­tana grounds and its his­tory.</p>
    <p>The vir­tual event also in­cluded a tour of the Is­tana grounds, courtesy of The Straits Times, which in­tro­duced guests to lesser-known spots such as an air-raid shel­ter known as the “bunker”.</p>
    <p>The Asian Civil­i­sa­tions Mu­seum (ACM) and the Na­tional Mu­seum also hosted seg­ments dur­ing the event, which at­tracted close to 25,000 views in to­tal.</p>
    <p>The ACM, which has been un­der­go­ing ma­jor trans­for­ma­tions over the last decade, un­veiled some of its new fea­tures such as a gallery fo­cused on ce­ram­ics.</p>
    <p>Mr Ken­nie Ting, di­rec­tor of the ACM, pre­sented a vir­tual tour of the mu­seum’s jew­ellery gallery where he in­tro­duced some of its cu­rated pieces such as a Per­anakan belt made of solid gold.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, the Na­tional Mu­seum’s Gov­ern­ment House Cheese Plate in­ter­acted with Pres­i­dent Hal­imah and more than 160 ben­e­fi­cia­ries of the Pres­i­dent’s Chal­lenge and The Straits Times School Pocket Money Fund.</p>
    <p>The Na­tional Mu­seum will be host­ing vir­tual con­fer­ences ti­tled Zoom into His­tory this week lead­ing up to Na­tional Day, where visi­tors can in­ter­act with mu­seum arte­facts like the cheese plate, voiced by lo­cal ac­tors and co­me­di­ans.</p>
    <p>The Na­tional Day Pa­rade 2020 or­gan­is­ing com­mit­tee also shared de­tails of this year’s cel­e­bra­tions dur­ing the open house and in­tro­duced the Our Heart for Sin­ga­pore project, which in­vites Sin­ga­pore­ans to share their re­flec­tions and as­pi­ra­tions for the nation.</p>
    <p>Round­ing off the vir­tual open house, Pres­i­dent Hal­imah en­cour­aged Sin­ga­pore­ans to tune in to the dif­fer­ent forms of Na­tional Day cel­e­bra­tions on Aug 9.</p>
    <p>“Happy Na­tional Day, ev­ery­one! Let’s stay united, let’s do our best to make Sin­ga­pore a bet­ter place for all of us.”</p>
