    <p>TURIN • In eight days, An­drea Pirlo has gone from wait­ing for his big break, to be­ing ap­pointed Juventus’ Un­der-23 coach to land­ing the top job with the nine-time de­fend­ing Serie A cham­pi­ons.</p>
    <p>The club be­lieve he has what it takes to lead them to long-awaited Cham­pi­ons League glory af­ter nam­ing him as their new coach on a two-year deal, fol­low­ing Mau­r­izio Sarri’s sack­ing on Satur­day.</p>
    <p>De­spite lead­ing Juve to their 36th Scud­etto, the former Chelsea man­ager paid the price for their Cham­pi­ons League last-16 exit to Lyon on away goals on Friday.</p>
    <p>His pre­de­ces­sor, Mas­si­m­il­iano Al­le­gri, was also ush­ered out for his fail­ure to end the club’s Euro­pean Cup drought dat­ing back to 1996.</p>
    <p>Rookie Pirlo will, how­ever, start with a clean slate and hav­ing won every hon­our in the game, in­clud­ing the 2006 World Cup, in stints with AC Mi­lan, Juve and the Az­zurri, the club are con­vinced he will bring about “a new chap­ter in world foot­ball”.</p>
    <p>An of­fi­cial state­ment read: “The choice is based on the be­lief that Pirlo has what it takes to lead from his debut on the bench, an ex­pert and tal­ented squad to pur­sue new suc­cesses.</p>
    <p>“To­day, be­gins a new chap­ter of his ca­reer in the world of foot­ball: from mae­stro to mister.”</p>
    <p>Since the end of his play­ing ca­reer in 2017, the 41-year-old has mainly been work­ing as a TV pun­dit, while fin­ish­ing his Uefa coach­ing li­cence.</p>
    <p>His of­ten jaded per­sona on air made him a pop­u­lar fig­ure on the In­ter­net, no­tably the meme, “Pirlo is not im­pressed”.</p>
    <p>He will have to be on the ball from the get-go, as not only will the new Serie A sea­son start in just over a month but he will also have to learn to man­age some of his former team­mates such as 42-yearold goal­keeper Gian­luigi Buf­fon.</p>
    <p>The ex-Italy No. 1 is­sued a warm wel­come, tweet­ing: “So now I have to call you Mister!?!?! Good luck for this new chal­lenge An­drea.”</p>
    <p>But not ev­ery­one is con­vinced, with Napoli coach Gen­naro Gat­tuso, a former AC Mi­lan mid­fielder, telling the Evening Stan­dard: “He’s lucky to be start­ing at Juve, but this pro­fes­sion is one where a great play­ing ca­reer is not enough.</p>
    <p>“Be­ing a player and be­ing a coach is re­ally not the same thing at all... It’s a dif­fer­ent world.”</p>
