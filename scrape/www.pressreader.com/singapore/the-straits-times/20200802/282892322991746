    <p>There is a say­ing which goes: The more things change, the more they stay the same.</p>
    <p>There is a great deal of truth in this, par­tic­u­larly when com­par­ing in­vest­ing in the 1990s ver­sus in­vest­ing to­day.</p>
    <p>In­di­vid­u­als may have ac­cess to a far broader range of mar­kets and prod­ucts now, and with the ad­vent of the In­ter­net, in­for­ma­tion is so much more freely avail­able to­day.</p>
    <p>Yet, even if the av­er­age in­vestor to­day ap­pears to be so much more so­phis­ti­cated than his 1990s coun­ter­part, is the ap­proach to in­vest­ing any dif­fer­ent?</p>
    <p>Maybe not, in terms of the mind­set.</p>
    <p>FI­NAN­CIAL TIPS</p>
    <p>Twenty years ago, in­vestors that the Se­cu­ri­ties In­vestors As­so­ci­a­tion Sin­ga­pore (Sias) dealt with were rel­a­tively un­in­formed about what they were buy­ing be­cause they did not have ac­cess to re­search on the In­ter­net back then.</p>
    <p>They were, there­fore, more likely to take short-term punts on stocks with no fun­da­men­tals, while re­ly­ing en­tirely on their remisiers for guid­ance, or, if you pre­fer, “tips”.</p>
    <p>CON­TRA TRAD­ING</p>
    <p>The short-term punt­ing men­tal­ity was en­cour­aged by “con­tra trad­ing”, which is a sys­tem unique to Sin­ga­pore and Malaysia.</p>
    <p>Con­tra has its roots in the mar­ket’s set­tle­ment pe­riod i n the 1990s – the term “t+five” means that sell­ers of shares had five mar­ket days after the trad­ing day (or “t”) to de­liver the shares and buy­ers also had five mar­ket days to pay for their pur­chases.</p>
    <p>If in­vestors bought stocks and sold them dur­ing those five days, they did not have to fork out the ini­tial pay­ment. In­stead, they would re­ceive a cheque for the “con­tra profit” if the stock price had risen dur­ing that pe­riod.</p>
    <p>Of course, they would have to pay for the loss if the price had fallen. In ex­change for this priv­i­lege, i nvestors paid a com­mis­sion of 1 per cent for each trade.</p>
    <p>It pro­vided un­lim­ited lever­age – it made some pun­ters rich very quickly and some poorer just as quickly. For­tu­nately, con­tra trad­ing is of­fi­cially no longer avail­able to­day.</p>
    <p>RE­SEARCH WAS HARD TO COME BY</p>
    <p>The re­liance on tips 20 years ago was also be­cause stock­broking re­search was not widely avail­able – firms would dis­trib­ute their “buy” and “sell” rec­om­men­da­tions to their most-val­ued clients first. Or­di­nary re­tail in­vestors would prob­a­bly ob­tain copies of these re­ports only a week or two later, by which time the use­ful­ness of the re­ports would have been se­verely di­luted.</p>
    <p>To­day, most individual play­ers have on­line ac­counts, all sorts of fi­nan­cial apps on their smart­phones and ac­cess to loads of re­search from dozens of web­sites.</p>
    <p>For ex­am­ple, to­day’s in­vestors know at their finger­tips what is ex­pected at up­com­ing key events, like the United States Fed­eral Re­serve’s Open Mar­ket Com­mit­tee meet­ings and how the mar­ket is likely to re­act.</p>
    <p>It is, there­fore, pos­si­ble to say that the level of so­phis­ti­ca­tion has risen con­sid­er­ably and that the av­er­age re­tail in­vestor is bet­ter in­formed than his coun­ter­part in the 1990s. But is there any real dif­fer­ence in in­vest­ing at­ti­tudes?</p>
    <p>One rea­son to doubt that there has been any sub­stan­tive change is that the short-term, punt­ing men­tal­ity which was preva­lent in the 1990s is widely en­cour­aged to­day by rock-bot­tom com­mis­sions be­ing of­fered and the much wider range of mar­kets and in­stru­ments that is now open to ev­ery­one.</p>
    <p>APPS FOR EV­ERY­THING – IN­CLUD­ING CRYP­TOCUR­REN­CIES</p>
    <p>Many pop­u­lar apps en­cour­age their users to trade in highly spec­u­la­tive “in­vest­ments”, like bit­coin and other cryp­tocur­ren­cies, in­stru­ments that are lack­ing in any fun­da­men­tal back­ing but can ex­hibit large volatil­ity.</p>
    <p>This ap­peals par­tic­u­larly to mil­len­ni­als, younger in­vestors un­der the age of 40 who might ac­cept these forms of non-tra­di­tional cur­ren­cies as le­git­i­mate modes of pay­ment and might feel con­fi­dent in their abil­ity to trade such in­stru­ments.</p>
    <p>Many apps also of­fer trad­ing in lever­aged se­cu­ri­ties such as Con­tracts for Dif­fer­ences, or CFDs, that can de­liver large gains, but, by the same to­ken, can re­sult in big losses too. In ad­di­tion, these prod­ucts in­clud­ing FX (for­eign ex­change) trad­ing are al­ready lever­aged, which means losses will be widened.</p>
    <p>Re­cently, Sias was in­formed that some FX traders have en­tered into a trad­ing strat­egy, called the Martin­gale strat­egy. This strat­egy is about dou­bling your trade size when you lose. The the­ory is that when you do win, you will re­gain what you have lost. One set­back of this strat­egy is that you are al­ways dou­bling your ex­po­sure, against the mar­ket trend.</p>
    <p>One must un­der­stand what the trad­ing strat­egy does, and not fol­low other traders blindly be­cause this can only lead to losses.</p>
    <p>Over­all, what is on of­fer is big short-term profit for the ac­tive day trader keen to pit his wits against the mar­ket. But is this wise?</p>
    <p>IN­CREASE IN RE­TAIL TRAD­ING</p>
    <p>(The Aus­tralian Se­cu­ri­ties and In­vest­ments Com­mis­sion) anal­y­sis of mar­kets dur­ing the Covid-19 pe­riod has re­vealed a sub­stan­tial in­crease in re­tail ac­tiv­ity across the se­cu­ri­ties mar­ket, as well as greater ex­po­sure to risk. We found that some re­tail in­vestors are en­gag­ing in short-term trad­ing strate­gies un­suc­cess­fully at­tempt­ing to time price trends.</p>
    <p>’’</p>
    <p>THE AUS­TRALIAN SE­CU­RI­TIES AND IN­VEST­MENTS COM­MIS­SION, in a re­port re­leased in May.</p>
    <p>EN­TER COVID-19 AND THE AUS­TRALIAN EX­PE­RI­ENCE</p>
    <p>Covid-19 has re­sulted in a big im­pact. Many mo­bile day-trad­ing apps have seen a large spike in de­mand for their ser­vices since coun­tries be­gan l ock­ing down their economies.</p>
    <p>This is per­haps not sur­pris­ing be­cause with ev­ery­one stay­ing at home and with more time on their hands, peo­ple will try their luck mak­ing money in the mar­ket.</p>
    <p>This can lead to prob­lems be­cause of the in­abil­ity of in­di­vid­u­als to cor­rectly get the tim­ing right when en­ter­ing and ex­it­ing mar­kets.</p>
    <p>Over in Aus­tralia, the reg­u­la­tors, the Aus­tralian Se­cu­ri­ties and In­vest­ments Com­mis­sion (Asic), re­leased in May a re­port show­ing that short-term day trad­ing had spiked dur­ing the country’s lock­down, adding that most pun­ters would have lost money.</p>
    <p>“Asic anal­y­sis of mar­kets dur­ing the Covid-19 pe­riod has re­vealed a sub­stan­tial in­crease in re­tail ac­tiv­ity across the se­cu­ri­ties mar­ket, as well as greater ex­po­sure to risk. We found that some re­tail in­vestors are en­gag­ing i n short-term trad­ing strate­gies un­suc­cess­fully at­tempt­ing to time price trends,” it said.</p>
    <p>“Trad­ing fre­quency has in­creased rapidly, as has the num­ber of dif­fer­ent se­cu­ri­ties traded per day, and the du­ra­tion for hold­ing the se­cu­ri­ties has sig­nif­i­cantly de­creased: in­di­cat­ing a con­cern­ing in­crease in short-term and ‘day-trad­ing’ ac­tiv­ity.</p>
    <p>“Even mar­ket pro­fes­sion­als find it hard to ‘time’ the mar­ket in a tur­bu­lent en­vi­ron­ment, and the risk of sig­nif­i­cant losses is a reg­u­lar chal­lenge. For re­tail in­vestors to at­tempt the same is par­tic­u­larly dan­ger­ous, and likely to lead to heavy losses – losses that could not hap­pen at a worse time for many fam­i­lies.”</p>
    <p>Asic’s anal­y­sis found that in the fo­cus pe­riod, on more than two thirds of the days where the av­er­age pun­ters were net buy­ers, prices de­clined the fol­low­ing day.</p>
    <p>The in­verse also hap­pened – on more than half the days where re­tail in­vestors were net sell­ers, their share prices “more likely” in­creased the next day.</p>
    <p>THE MORE THINGS CHANGE...</p>
    <p>It was be­cause re­tail in­vestors were of­ten aim­ing for short-term spec­u­la­tive prof­its in the 1990s and get­ting burnt fre­quently that Sias was prompted to start of­fer­ing free ed­u­ca­tional sem­i­nars and work­shops, as well as to start its in-house re­search unit.</p>
    <p>It is ob­vi­ous that these ser­vices are still very much needed. This decade, in­vestor pro­file and ac­cess to in­for­ma­tion may have changed, but the un­der­ly­ing mo­ti­va­tions and ap­proach to­wards in­vest­ing have not. The more things change, the more they stay the same.</p>
