    <p>Covid-19 vac­cine tri­als are be­ing ex­pe­dited in Sin­ga­pore in a way that could halve the time it would nor­mally take to have a new vac­cine ap­proved.</p>
    <p>The Health Sciences Author­ity (HSA) told The Straits Times that this is to en­sure “Sin­ga­pore has con­tin­ued ac­cess to crit­i­cal health prod­ucts to deal with the Covid-19 pan­demic”.</p>
    <p>What it is do­ing is to al­low for “a rolling sub­mis­sion process” so that, in­stead of sub­mit­ting data to the au­thor­i­ties at the end of each phase of the trial, com­pa­nies may do so while the tri­als are be­ing con­ducted.</p>
    <p>The HSA said phar­ma­ceu­ti­cal com­pa­nies can sub­mit real-time clinical and man­u­fac­tur­ing data to sup­port the safety and ef­fi­cacy of the vac­cine, while the clinical tri­als and stud­ies are on­go­ing.</p>
    <p>Such rolling sub­mis­sions, it ex­plained, al­low reg­u­la­tors to con­duct si­mul­ta­ne­ous real-time re­view of the data avail­able to date, in­stead of wait­ing for all the data to be gath­ered be­fore sub­mis­sion.</p>
    <p>Its spokesman said this speeds up the ap­proval process, while en­sur­ing that rel­e­vant safe­guards are in place. She added that do­ing so could “re­duce the reg­u­la­tory turn­around time by half the usual time­lines”, pro­vided there are no sig­nif­i­cant ad­verse events.</p>
    <p>The spokesman said the author­ity is also pro­vid­ing “early con­sul­ta­tion and ad­vice to guide com­pa­nies in the clinical de­vel­op­ment of vac­cines and reg­u­la­tory re­quire­ments for prod­uct au­tho­ri­sa­tion from HSA”.</p>
    <p>The Euro­pean Medicines Agency – the ap­prov­ing author­ity for the Euro­pean Union the way the HSA is for Sin­ga­pore – said on Oct 1 that it had ini­ti­ated a sim­i­lar rolling re­view of As­traZeneca and the Uni­ver­sity of Ox­ford’s Covid-19 vac­cine can­di­date AZD1222.</p>
    <p>There is cur­rently only one Covid-19 vac­cine can­di­date be­ing tested here, the Lu­nar-CoV19 jointly de­vel­oped by Duke-NUS and Arc­turus Ther­a­peu­tics.</p>
    <p>Pro­fes­sor Ooi Eng Eong of the Duke-NUS Med­i­cal School, the prin­ci­pal in­ves­ti­ga­tor here for the vac­cine, said get­ting the vac­cine from con­cept, through pre-clinical stud­ies to phase one and two clinical tri­als in less than five months would not have been pos­si­ble with­out HSA’s will­ing­ness to ac­cept re­al­time data.</p>
    <p>It nor­mally takes years for a new vac­cine to get to the mar­ket.</p>
    <p>He said: “Rolling sub­mis­sion of our pre-clinical data was very use­ful to en­sure that all the nec­es­sary data to sup­port our clinical trial was re­viewed and ap­proved swiftly.”</p>
    <p>Ap­proval for tri­alling the vac­cine here was given in July and the first phase in­volv­ing young healthy vol­un­teers, each get­ting one in­jec­tion of vary­ing doses, started in Au­gust.</p>
    <p>In the sec­ond phase, with peo­ple up to the age of 80, par­tic­i­pants are each given two doses of the vac­cine.</p>
    <p>In both phases, some of the par­tic­i­pants are given a placebo in­stead of the vac­cine. Al­to­gether, slightly more than 100 peo­ple are in­volved.</p>
    <p>This trial should end in December, and the study of the trial is set to be com­pleted by Jan­uary.</p>
    <p>Prof Ooi said do­ing a com­bined phase one and two trial al­lowed them “to tran­si­tion swiftly from test­ing a range of dif­fer­ent doses of vac­cines in healthy young adults to a larger cohort of vol­un­teers that in­clude older adults us­ing a nar­rowed range of doses”.</p>
    <p>“Th­ese sets of data would then en­able us to de­cide on the vac­ci­na­tion strat­egy for phase three clinical trial.”</p>
    <p>It is nec­es­sary to test the vac­cine in older peo­ple as vac­cines are of­ten less ef­fec­tive for them.</p>
    <p>Phase three usu­ally in­volves large num­bers of peo­ple to es­tab­lish the ef­fec­tive­ness and safety of the vac­cine in the pop­u­la­tion at large.</p>
    <p>The World Health Or­gan­i­sa­tion’s Oct 2 update said there were 42 can­di­date vac­cines in clinical eval­u­a­tion – in­clud­ing Lu­nar-CoV19 – and 151 in pre-clinical eval­u­a­tion.</p>
