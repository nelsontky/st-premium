    <p>BARCELONA Dy­namo Kiev were ex­pected to be easy pick­ings, hav­ing trav­elled to Spain with­out nine of their play­ers due to a Covid-19 out­break at their club.</p>
    <p>It was, how­ever, not a straight­for­ward af­fair at the Nou Camp as the Ukrainian side were more than a match for Barcelona.</p>
    <p>The hosts had Marc-An­dre ter Ste­gen, mak­ing his first ap­pear­ance of the cam­paign be­cause of in­jury, to thank for a nervy Cham­pi­ons League 2-1 Group G vic­tory over Dy­namo on Wed­nes­day.</p>
    <p>Cap­tain Lionel Messi opened the scor­ing via a penalty, while Gerard</p>
    <p>Pique scored the sec­ond be­fore Vik­tor Tsy­hankov pulled one back for the vis­i­tors. But it was ter Ste­gen who had to make a string of ex­cel­lent stops to pre­vent an­other dis­ap­point­ing re­sult for Barca.</p>
    <p>Their 100 per cent record so far in the Cham­pi­ons League stands in con­trast to a stum­bling start to the sea­son in La Liga – they have not won in four games – but Wed­nes­day’s nervy per­for­mance will do lit­tle to ease the pres­sure on coach Ron­ald Koe­man.</p>
    <p>Ad­mit­ting they got away with the win, the Dutch­man told Span­ish TV chan­nel Mo­vis­tar: “We started the match well and quickly made it 1-0, but we were un­able to find the sec­ond goal and then lost con­trol. Thanks to Marc, who has been phe­nom­e­nal, we man­aged to keep the op­po­si­tion out. He has proved to be a great goal­keeper.</p>
    <p>“We have to play bet­ter and im­prove the game with­out the ball. Today we did not do that well.”</p>
    <p>Dy­namo coach Mircea Lucescu was left unim­pressed, claim­ing “Barca are not good enough to win the Cham­pi­ons League”, and Pique agreed with the as­sess­ment their European Cup drought may ex­tend to six years.</p>
    <p>“It’s to be ex­pected that we’re not con­sid­ered as con­tenders af­ter what’s hap­pened in re­cent years,” he told Span­ish daily AS. “It won’t be easy this year but we still be­lieve we can achieve big things.”</p>
    <p>In the same group, Cris­tiano Ron­aldo made his first start for Ju­ven­tus since Septem­ber af­ter re­cov­er­ing from Covid-19 as the Ital­ian cham­pi­ons emerged with a 4-1 win at Hun­gary’s Ferenc­varos.</p>
    <p>An Al­varo Mo­rata brace, a strike by Paulo Dy­bala and an own goal from Lasha Dvali en­sured the vis­i­tors re­main three points be­hind Barca (nine).</p>
