    <p>The Straits Times Vir­tual Run (STVR) may be end­ing on Thurs­day but, for some of you, this could be the be­gin­ning of a healthy habit. STVR and New Bal­ance Run Club coach Loh Guo Pei hopes to help you dur­ing your fi­nal lap and be­yond by an­swer­ing three reader ques­tions.</p>
    <p>Q I am new to run­ning and aim to take part in a 5km race. Should I fo­cus on build­ing up my stamina or my speed?</p>
    <p>A There are sev­eral schools of thought but my train­ing method would be a good mix­ture of en­durance and speed train­ing for a 5km race.</p>
    <p>As a 5km race is an en­durance event, it is im­por­tant to build up your aer­o­bic sys­tem by clock­ing more mileage for a start.</p>
    <p>Do not be too ea­ger on speed train­ing too early, as it will re­sult in a higher chance of in­jury.</p>
    <p>With­out a good en­durance base, muscles may not be built to gen­er­ate the strength re­quired for speed.</p>
    <p>Keep track of your weekly mileage (three to four runs a week) and grad­u­ally in­crease your dis­tance by 5 to 10 per cent in or­der to min­imise the risk of in­jury.</p>
    <p>Af­ter about four to six weeks of con­sis­tent train­ing, it is time to try and in­cor­po­rate some speed train­ing.</p>
    <p>A speed work­out can be run­ning in­ter­val sets any­where be­tween 200m and 600m at a pace faster than your usual.</p>
    <p>Go­ing for a shorter dis­tance of two or three km at a faster pace would also help.</p>
    <p>Q I pre­fer to run in na­ture parks.</p>
    <p>Any ad­vice for run­ning on trails? Do I need to take pre­cau­tions or in­vest in trail shoes?</p>
    <p>A If you are ex­plor­ing new routes, it would be ad­vis­able to run with a buddy or in­ter­est group that is ex­pe­ri­enced as you would want to avoid get­ting lost.</p>
    <p>Bring a whis­tle, phone, wa­ter and some dry food in case of an emer­gency.</p>
    <p>If you plan to head out solo, in­form a friend or two on your where­abouts be­fore you em­bark on the run. Pro­vide an es­ti­mated du­ra­tion and up­date your friends af­ter com­ple­tion.</p>
    <p>Take note of the du­ra­tion/dis­tance you re­quire for the trail, as some trails might seem short.</p>
    <p>How­ever, due to the hilly ter­rain, you may take two to three times longer to com­plete the same dis­tance as com­pared to run­ning on flat ground.</p>
    <p>Bring along a small bot­tle for hy­dra­tion or en­ergy gels/bars to fuel you up.</p>
    <p>Ne­go­ti­at­ing through the rough ter­rain may drain you out faster than you think. You can use a small waist pouch to house the gels and bars and carry a hy­dra­tion bag to stay com­fort­able.</p>
    <p>Choose an eas­ier ter­rain first, so you can be more ag­ile and adapt to</p>
    <p>the sur­round­ings.</p>
    <p>Lastly, run­ning on trails of­ten in­volves rapid changes in di­rec­tion and un­even ter­rain, which re­quire a lot of fo­cus and a good core to main­tain bal­ance.</p>
    <p>I would rec­om­mend you in­vest in a good pair of trail run­ning shoes to pro­tect your feet and pre­vent any po­ten­tial in­juries from the un­even ter­rain. An ex­am­ple of a good pair is the New Bal­ance Fresh Foam Hi­erro V5.</p>
    <p>When get­ting trail shoes, it is rec­om­mended that you al­low more al­lowance for the toe box room as com­pared to nor­mal run­ning shoes.</p>
    <p>It is es­pe­cially im­por­tant when you are go­ing down­hill, as you would want to avoid get­ting your toes bruised.</p>
    <p>Try the shoes to get a first-hand ex­pe­ri­ence and un­der­stand the dif­fer­ence be­tween run­ning shoes and trail shoes.</p>
    <p>Q What should I do when I hit the wall on a long run?</p>
    <p>A Hit­ting the wall of­ten refers to the de­ple­tion of the stored glyco­gen (car­bo­hy­drate that is stored in our muscles and liver for en­ergy) and it feels like your body is shut­ting down.</p>
    <p>Some things you can do when</p>
    <p>you hit the wall are:</p>
    <p>• Slow down and ad­just your pace. Do a walk/jog strat­egy, take a short walk break be­tween 45 and 90 sec­onds for ev­ery one km that you run.</p>
    <p>• Fuel your body with sports drinks or gum­mies.</p>
    <p>Some suggestion­s to re­duce the chances of “hit­ting the wall” on marathon race day:</p>
    <p>• Train­ing prepa­ra­tion: Slowly in­crease mileage (a 5-10 per cent in­cre­ment weekly) for long runs to al­low your body to adapt to train­ing stim­u­lus. You may plan a few short runs dur­ing week­days and a long run dur­ing the week­end. Grad­u­ally over­load your body with a lit­tle stres­sor, such as longer dis­tance or faster speed for the shorter runs, and al­low your body to adapt be­fore re­peat­ing the process. Do not for­get to in­clude rest days.</p>
    <p>• Nu­tri­tion strat­egy: Carbo load­ing is to en­sure suf­fi­cient glyco­gen stor­age be­fore your race, and it usu­ally hap­pens two to three days be­fore your marathon race day. How­ever, it is just as im­por­tant to en­sure you are prop­erly fu­elled up be­fore long runs if you are plan­ning to clock a long run of be­tween 28 and 32km that is close to your race pace. In or­der to en­sure ad­e­quate en­ergy, it is help­ful to con­sume some sweets or gels/bars dur­ing the run. • Hy­dra­tion strat­egy: Con­sis­tently hy­drate dur­ing your run with sports drinks ev­ery 30 min­utes or so to pre­vent de­hy­dra­tion.</p>
    <p>• Pac­ing your runs: Avoid surges dur­ing long runs, as sud­den in­creases in pace will in­crease the rate of glyco­gen be­ing utilised. Also avoid go­ing too fast at the start, even when you feel good.</p>
    <p>• Burn­ing fat for fuel: Apart from speed train­ing and clock­ing mileage, it is im­por­tant to train your body to be more ef­fi­cient in burn­ing fat for fuel dur­ing easy runs. In­clude long, slow re­cov­ery runs in your pro­gramme – ex­er­cis­ing for a longer du­ra­tion and at lower in­ten­sity pro­motes fat burn­ing. Al­ter­na­tively, com­plete your long runs be­fore break­fast, as with less glyco­gen stored in the body when you wake up, your body will turn to burn­ing the stored fat for fuel.</p>
