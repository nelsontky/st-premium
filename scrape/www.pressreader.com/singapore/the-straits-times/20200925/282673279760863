    <p>Noth­ing pleases me more than a piece of pork grilled beau­ti­fully. And at Mat­sukiya, a newish kushiyaki restaurant at The Paragon, the Ton­toro Spicy Ra­men ($21, right) is a work of art.</p>
    <p>The pig jowl boasts lightly charred fat and a very springy tex­ture. It needs noth­ing more, but I dab some yuzu kosho on a piece, dip an­other into a small pile of shichimi tog­a­rashi, and shiver with joy. As if all this is not enough, the pork sits on thin, straight ra­men done al­most bak chor mee-style, be­ing tossed with shio kombu, chilli, chicken fat and chicken stock. It is an umami bomb.</p>
    <p>The restaurant also has well-priced set lunches. I have the ba­sic $25 one (far right), which comes with an ap­pe­tiser, soup, pick­les, a soft-boiled egg, rice and a choice of three sticks of kushiyaki.</p>
    <p>I plumb for chicken thigh, chicken skin and ba­con wrapped around cherry toma­toes. All are ex­cel­lent. Thigh meat is in­de­struc­tible and the three pieces here are juicy. The restaurant uses a French breed of chicken raised in Jo­hor Baru. The skin is suit­ably crisp and is per­fect with ei­ther the shichimi tog­a­rashi or yuzu kosho, both of which you can help your­self to at the ta­ble or counter.</p>
    <p>But re­ally, it is the ba­con-wrapped cherry tomato that thrills me most, burst­ing de­light­fully.</p>
    <p>On the day I dine there, the ap­pe­tiser is the fresh­est edamame, the pods still on the stem. They are cooked per­fectly al dente. The rice is not plain white. It’s cooked in dashi with shreds of bur­dock and is so aro­matic. Bur­dock is also in the bowl of rich chicken soup that is part of the set.</p>
    <p>The restaurant claims that mid­dle ground be­tween high-end and mass-mar­ket yak­i­tori, and I am de­ter­mined to go back for din­ner. So many de­lights await me, judg­ing from the a la carte things I try: tebasaki ($5) or chicken wings with phe­nom­e­nally crisp skin; seseri ($6), bone­less chicken neck, so prized in the best yak­i­tori restau­rants; and the most glo­ri­ous tsukune ($5), a ball of chicken chopped not too fine and stud­ded with crunchy car­ti­lage. It is so good I don’t want to dip it in the raw egg yolk. But I do. It is even better.</p>
