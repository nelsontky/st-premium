    <p>The Hous­ing Board will be of­fer­ing for sale this month 1,044 Build-To-Or­der (BTO) flats in Sin­ga­pore’s new­est town Ten­gah. Slated for launch in May, the sale was de­ferred be­cause of the Covid-19 pan­demic. The Parc Res­i­dences @ Ten­gah project is the first BTO hous­ing par­cel to be launched in the new Park dis­trict, the third of five dis­tricts in Ten­gah where HDB flats are be­ing of­fered for sale.</p>
    <p>Af­ter a de­lay brought on by the Covid-19 pan­demic, Sin­ga­pore’s new­est town Ten­gah will see an­other 1,044 Build-To-Or­der (BTO) flats of­fered for sale this month in a new dis­trict to be built in a lush set­ting.</p>
    <p>The Parc Res­i­dences @ Ten­gah project is the first BTO hous­ing par­cel to be launched in the new Park dis­trict, which will hold an es­ti­mated 7,200 new flats when fully com­pleted, the Hous­ing Board (HDB) an­nounced yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Park is the third of five dis­tricts in Ten­gah where HDB flats are be­ing of­fered for sale.</p>
    <p>The HDB said Ten­gah, which is about the size of Bis­han and billed as Sin­ga­pore’s “for­est town”, will ded­i­cate about 20 per cent of its 700ha to green spa­ces.</p>
    <p>Lo­cated next to Ten­gah’s Cen­tral Park green lung, the Park dis­trict will oc­cupy 104ha and fea­ture a num­ber of green ways, such as a 1.5km-long rain­for­est walk.</p>
    <p>Ten­gah is the first HDB town to be de­vel­oped since Pung­gol more than two decades ago.</p>
    <p>The Ten­gah mas­ter­plan was first re­vealed in 2016, and since 2018, over 7,000 new flats have been of­fered. When fully de­vel­oped, the town will have about 42,000 new homes, with the first res­i­dents ex­pected to start mov­ing in from 2022.</p>
    <p>A key fea­ture of Ten­gah is the car-free town cen­tre. Roads will run be­neath it to free up the ground level and to al­low for a bi­cy­cle­friendly en­vi­ron­ment.</p>
    <p>The town cen­tre will house an ar­ray of com­mer­cial and re­tail spa­ces and eater­ies, as well as a sports cen­tre. It will be di­rectly con­nected to a fu­ture MRT sta­tion, one of four on the up­com­ing Jurong Re­gion Line net­work that will serve Ten­gah res­i­dents. The MRT line will pro­gres­sively open from 2026.</p>
    <p>The homes in Parc Res­i­dences @ Ten­gah com­prise two-room flexi as well as three-, four- and five-room flats in 12 res­i­den­tial blocks, with stag­gered heights rang­ing from seven to 14 storeys.</p>
    <p>The flats will be ori­ented to max­imise green views, said the HDB. Some blocks will be con­nected via the Sky Gal­le­ria, an el­e­vated land­scaped linkway on the eighth floor.</p>
    <p>The flats will come with an ad­di­tional data point and power point, as well as smart sock­ets and a smart dis­tri­bu­tion board so that res­i­dents can adopt smart home devices with ease.</p>
    <p>The homes are part of a “new gen­er­a­tion of pub­lic hous­ing tak­ing shape in HDB towns”, said the HDB.</p>
    <p>“In­cor­po­rat­ing na­ture and el­e­ments that pro­mote health and well­ness, they will fur­ther en­hance the to­tal qual­ity of life for res­i­dents.”</p>
    <p>Ms Chris­tine Sun, head of re­search and con­sul­tancy at OrangeTee & Tie, said Ten­gah may ap­peal to na­ture lovers who do not mind going car-lite. “As the pan­demic evolves and changes the way we work in fu­ture, per­haps the idea of work­ing from home, sit­ting on your bal­cony and fac­ing the green­ery in Ten­gah may be quite at­trac­tive to some,” she said.</p>
    <p>Parc Res­i­dences @ Ten­gah was orig­i­nally slated to launch in May, but the ex­ten­sion of the cir­cuit breaker pe­riod forced a de­fer­ment.</p>
    <p>Be­sides Ten­gah, the HDB will later this month of­fer about 7,800 BTO flats in Ang Mo Kio, Bis­han, Choa Chu Kang, Gey­lang, Pasir Ris, Tampines and Wood­lands.</p>
    <p>A fur­ther 5,700 flats in Bis­han, Sem­bawang, Tampines, Ten­gah and Toa Payoh will be launched in Novem­ber.</p>
    <p>Rain­for­est-themed play­grounds, a green lung called Cen­tral Park and a 1.5km-long rain­for­est walk that con­nects var­i­ous hous­ing projects.</p>
    <p>These are some of the green fea­tures fu­ture res­i­dents liv­ing in Ten­gah’s new Park dis­trict can look forward to.</p>
    <p>It is the third of five dis­tricts planned for Sin­ga­pore’s new­est hous­ing es­tate, which is lo­cated in the west.</p>
    <p>Pub­lic hous­ing in two of the dis­tricts – Plan­ta­tion and Gar­den – was launched ear­lier. The other two dis­tricts in Ten­gah are Brick­land and For­est Hill.</p>
    <p>Since 2018, the Hous­ing Board has launched more than 7,000 new flats across six Build-To-Or­der (BTO) projects in the town.</p>
    <p>In line with its name, Park will have a mul­ti­tude of green spa­ces to pro­vide its res­i­dents with a park­like en­vi­ron­ment, while be­ing con­nected to its town cen­tre.</p>
    <p>About 20 per cent of the 700ha of land in Ten­gah will be ded­i­cated to green spa­ces, the Hous­ing Board said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>All five dis­tricts will in­cor­po­rate bio­philic de­signs to con­nect res­i­dents to na­ture, to “in­crease their over­all well-be­ing, pro­mote bet­ter health and a greater sense of place”, added HDB.</p>
    <p>The 104ha Park dis­trict is where the “car-free” Ten­gah town cen­tre is sited.</p>
    <p>Ten­gah’s green cen­tre­piece</p>
    <p>Cen­tral Park will fea­ture a “for­est stream”, which is an ex­ist­ing canal that will be nat­u­ralised and land­scaped.</p>
    <p>HDB is work­ing with the Na­tional Parks Board to de­velop parks and green spa­ces to fa­cil­i­tate eco­log­i­cal con­nec­tiv­ity.</p>
    <p>A 1.5km-long rain­for­est walk will weave through var­i­ous hous­ing projects so res­i­dents can eas­ily ac­cess Cen­tral Park and the 15m- to 20m-wide for­est fringe that will run around the town.</p>
    <p>Within the rain­for­est walk, there will be na­ture-themed chil­dren’s play­grounds, fitness sta­tions, open green spa­ces and seat­ing ar­eas.</p>
    <p>The plant­ing along the walk will be lay­ered to mimic the emer­gent, canopy and un­der­storey lay­ers found in a trop­i­cal rain­for­est, and in­clude fea­tures such as veg­e­tated swales and rain gar­dens.</p>
    <p>A 100m-wide, 5km-long for­est cor­ri­dor, which will run par­al­lel to the rain­for­est walk, will link Ten­gah to the sur­round­ing green net­work be­tween the western and cen­tral catch­ment ar­eas.</p>
    <p>Also in the works are Plan­ta­tion and Gar­den farmways, which will ex­tend from two other dis­tricts in Ten­gah – Plan­ta­tion and Gar­den, re­spec­tively.</p>
    <p>These farmways, which tra­verse Park dis­trict, are about 600m long and 40m wide on av­er­age.</p>
    <p>Within Park dis­trict, some 3,000 sq m of green space – the equiv­a­lent of about 33 four-room flats – will be set aside for com­mu­nity gar­den­ing and farm­ing within the farmways. This is in ad­di­tion to the com­mu­nity gar­dens within in­di­vid­ual pub­lic hous­ing projects.</p>
    <p>These ac­tiv­i­ties will of­fer res­i­dents the op­por­tu­nity to “ex­pe­ri­ence a dif­fer­ent life­style, con­nect with one an­other and re­live the kam­pung spirit”, HDB said.</p>
    <p>This month, 1,044 BTO flats will be of­fered for sale in the Parc Res­i­dences @ Ten­gah project.</p>
    <p>The multi-storey carpark within the BTO project will fea­ture a rooftop gar­den.</p>
    <p>Its ground level will be kept car­free to house ameni­ties such as a child­care cen­tre, fitness sta­tions and a play­ground.</p>
    <p>Ten­gah is the first HDB town to be planned with smart tech­nolo­gies town-wide from the out­set.</p>
    <p>For in­stance, it will use smart light­ing and an ur­ban wa­ter har­vest­ing sys­tem to col­lect and store rain­wa­ter for non-potable uses.</p>
    <p>About 20 per cent of the 700 ha of land in Ten­gah will be ded­i­cated to green spa­ces, the Hous­ing Board said yes­ter­day. All five dis­tricts will in­cor­po­rate bio­philic de­signs to con­nect res­i­dents to na­ture, to “in­crease their over­all well-be­ing, pro­mote bet­ter health and a greater sense of place”, added HDB.</p>
    <p>A pneu­matic waste con­veyance sys­tem will make waste col­lec­tion and es­tate main­te­nance more ef­fi­cient.</p>
    <p>Home own­ers i n some BTO projects in the Plan­ta­tion, Gar­den and Park dis­tricts will also have the op­tion of sub­scrib­ing to a cen­tralised cool­ing sys­tem of­fered by SP Group, which is more en­ergy-ef­fi­cient.</p>
