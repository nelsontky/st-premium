    <p>One day in April, as the coro­n­avirus rav­aged New York City, 24-yearold Is­abelle Ro­driguez com­posed a tweet she would send from the grave.</p>
    <p>She wasn’t dy­ing. She wasn’t even sick. In fact, her risk of con­tract­ing Covid-19 had been re­duced af­ter she was fur­loughed from her job at a Man­hat­tan book­seller and she had re­treated to her ru­ral home­town in Florida.</p>
    <p>She con­ceded that it might seem a lit­tle weird to be con­sid­er­ing all of this i n her mid-20s. But then, young peo­ple around the world were get­ting in­cred­i­bly sick, in­cred­i­bly fast.</p>
    <p>End-of-life de­ci­sions can be over­whelm­ing, but mak­ing those choices when she was healthy gave her more con­trol. Know­ing that she’d ease the bur­den on her fam­ily if the worst hap­pened also gave her peace of mind. “It would be eas­ier for peo­ple around me to know what I want,” she said.</p>
    <p>Be­fore the pan­demic, end-of-life start-ups such as Cake – firms that help clients plan funer­als, dis­pose of re­mains and process grief – had seen steady to mod­er­ate growth. Their founders were mostly women who hoped a mix of tech­nol­ogy, cus­tomi­sa­tion and fresh think­ing could take on the fusty and pre­dom­i­nantly male fu­neral and es­tate-plan­ning in­dus­tries.</p>
    <p>Still, sell­ing death to peo­ple in their 20s and 30s wasn’t easy. Cake’s team some­times had e-mails from young adults, won­der­ing if the site wasn’t a tad mor­bid. Since Covid-19, this has changed.</p>
    <p>Mil­len­ni­als are newly anx­ious about their mor­tal­ity, in­creas­ingly com­fort­able talk­ing about it and more likely to be griev­ing or know some­one who is.</p>
    <p>“The stigma and taboos around talk­ing about death have been way re­duced,” Cake’s co-founder Suelin Chen, 38, said. This has driven con­ver­sa­tion across so­cial me­dia, spurred in­ter­est in death­flu­encers and led to an in­crease in traf­fic to end-of-life plat­forms.</p>
    <p>From Fe­bru­ary to June, peo­ple signed up with Cake at five times the nor­mal rate.</p>
    <p>Another new com­pany, Lantern, which calls it­self “the sin­gle source of guid­ance for nav­i­gat­ing life be­fore and af­ter a death”, saw a 123 per cent in­crease in users, most of them un­der 45.</p>
    <p>Lantern’s tone is sooth­ing and earnest, but not ev­ery­one takes that tack. Cake skews to­wards the play­ful. It fea­tures a tomb­stone gen­er­a­tor and sug­ges­tions like “Vik­ing fu­neral” and “shoot my ashes into outer space”.</p>
    <p>New Nar­ra­tive, an event-plan­ning com­pany deal­ing with funer­als and memo­ri­als, in­tro­duces it­self with a wink: “We’re not your grandma’s fu­neral (... un­less it’s your grandma’s fu­neral).”</p>
    <p>It’s a tricky op­por­tu­nity for these start-ups to nav­i­gate. “When you have a brand that’s di­rectly in­ter­fac­ing with peo­ple in the throes of loss and grief, you have to walk a fine line,” said Lantern’s co-founder and chief ex­ec­u­tive Liz Eddy, 30.</p>
    <p>All these founders em­pha­sise that they’re not try­ing to cap­i­talise on the coro­n­avirus.</p>
    <p>The com­pa­nies have cre­ated new fo­rums and con­tent on how to plan for death, honour the newly dead and grieve vir­tu­ally. They have ini­tia­tives with ma­jor health­care providers to dis­sem­i­nate their prod­ucts more widely and formed new part­ner­ships with in­flu­encers.</p>
    <p>The start-ups have even be­gun to co­or­di­nate with one another, shar­ing tips in a cross-com­pany Slack chan­nel called “Death & Co”. They are all hop­ing the pan­demic will be the event that turns end-of-life plan­ning – from de­sign­ing a fu­neral to writ­ing a will and fi­nal tweet – into a com­mon part of adult­hood.</p>
    <p>In 2012, a friend in­vited Ms Chen and her fi­ance to din­ner and sug­gested they play an un­usual party game: Write and share their own obit­u­ar­ies. “It’ll be fun!” the friend said. “They do it at Stan­ford Busi­ness School.” At first, Ms Chen was de­lighted by the ex­er­cise: Both she and her fi­ance wrote, in the imag­ined past tense, about a mu­sic al­bum they hoped to one day record. But when Ms Chen started read­ing what she had writ­ten about her ca­reer, she was seized with panic and</p>
