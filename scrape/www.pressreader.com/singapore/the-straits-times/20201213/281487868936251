    <p>Over the past few weeks, Net­flix se­ries The Queen’s Gam­bit has cap­tured the at­ten­tion of mil­lions around the world as they watch the show’s pro­tag­o­nist Beth Har­mon rise through the ranks in the male-dom­i­nated world of chess en route to earn­ing the cov­eted grand­mas­ter ti­tle.</p>
    <p>Be­com­ing a grand­mas­ter – the high­est ti­tle a chess player can at­tain – is no easy feat for any­one. But his­tor­i­cally, women have found it hard to com­pete on an equal foot­ing with men. Of the 1,415 ac­tive grand­mas­ters world­wide in gov­ern­ing body the In­ter­na­tional Chess Fed­er­a­tion’s (Fide) rat­ings list, only 29 are women.</p>
    <p>These num­bers are re­flec­tive of the re­al­ity in Sin­ga­pore’s chess scene too – all four grand­mas­ters are male, with the Re­pub­lic yet to pro­duce a fe­male grand­mas­ter.</p>
    <p>The coun­try’s only SEA Games gold medal­list Gong Qianyun, how­ever, is a woman grand­mas­ter, a ti­tle awarded ex­clu­sively to women. It re­quires about 200 fewer Elo rat­ing points in the chess rank­ing sys­tem to achieve that com­pared to the grand­mas­ter ti­tle.</p>
    <p>Will Sin­ga­pore ever have its own fe­male grand­mas­ter?</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore Chess Fed­er­a­tion (SCF) pres­i­dent Chris Lim cer­tainly be­lieves that there are – and have been – promis­ing play­ers with the po­ten­tial to be among the top. One such player is Em­manuelle Hng, 19, a woman Fide mas­ter who SCF has iden­ti­fied as some­one who can be­come a woman grand­mas­ter.</p>
    <p>Lim de­scribes Hng, who is two rungs away from the top women’s ti­tle, as a “clear No. 2 ” be­hind Gong.</p>
    <p>But a few fac­tors have im­peded the progress of women here.</p>
    <p>He said: “The game has evolved over the years where nat­u­ral tal­ent alone is in­suf­fi­cient, and to ex­cel you re­ally need to spend the time learn­ing, un­der­stand­ing and mem­o­ris­ing very many lines of play that the com­put­ers have an­a­lysed.</p>
    <p>“But we are not hun­gry enough and time is the one re­source we do not have enough of, given that our youth are spend­ing their time in pur­suit of aca­demic ex­cel­lence and in­flu­enced by par­ents con­cerned over their fu­ture ca­reers.”</p>
    <p>DEARTH OF FE­MALE PLAY­ERS</p>
    <p>With chess his­tor­i­cally be­ing a men’s game, there are fewer fe­males play­ing the game com­pet­i­tively. Cur­rently, of the 350 ac­tive play­ers in Sin­ga­pore who com­pete in Fide-rated tour­na­ments, only 53 are fe­male.</p>
    <p>Gong feels that this could make it scary for fe­males look­ing to en­ter the chess scene. The 35-yearold said: “I think this is due to a long his­tory of cul­tures glob­ally where males are more em­pow­ered to pick up ‘think­ing’ games from young.</p>
    <p>“It is def­i­nitely not the case in Sin­ga­pore now and much im­proved world­wide, but chess has been around for thou­sands of years, and that means any­one who wants to pick up chess will see that it is much more male-pop­u­lated. This might in­tim­i­date more fe­males in pick­ing up chess.”</p>
    <p>LEAV­ING THE GAME EARLY</p>
    <p>While sta­tis­tics show that fe­males make up about 15 per cent of the ac­tive chess play­ers in Sin­ga­pore, the dif­fer­ence in the num­ber of males and fe­males in the younger age groups is not as dras­tic. The ra­tio for the younger age group hov­ers at about one girl to ev­ery three boys for the Na­tional Schools In­di­vid­ual Chess Cham­pi­onships and in the Na­tional Schools Team Cham­pi­onship, the num­ber of girls’ and boys’ teams are quite even.</p>
    <p>The num­ber of par­tic­i­pants at the Na­tional Schools In­di­vid­ual Chess Cham­pi­onships has in­creased from 600 in the mid-1990s to 2000 to a record 1,330 last year.</p>
    <p>But un­sur­pris­ingly, chess tends to take a back­seat for many play­ers here – re­gard­less of gen­der – as stud­ies and their ca­reers take prece­dence. Sin­ga­pore’s Kevin Goh took 13 years to fi­nally earn the grand­mas­ter ti­tle in April.</p>
    <p>Apart from ca­reer and stud­ies, some may choose to play less to fo­cus on their fam­i­lies.</p>
    <p>SEA Games bronze medal­list Hazel Liu, 30, said: “Be­yond a cer­tain age, fam­ily com­mit­ments may also come into play for women, which may po­ten­tially af­fect chess and ca­reer alike.”</p>
    <p>Founder of chess club Sin­ga­pore Chess So­cial Jimmy Tan, 47, said: “If you go to the grass­roots level, school tour­na­ments, you do see a lot of girls, the ra­tio isn’t what you see at the adult tour­na­ments.”</p>
    <p>GEN­DER DE­BATE</p>
    <p>Fide vice-pres­i­dent Nigel Short, a grand­mas­ter at 19, stated in 2015 that men are “hard­wired” to be bet­ter chess play­ers than women. But hav­ing played against and lost games to fe­male play­ers be­fore, Goh dis­agrees.</p>
    <p>He said: “I do not think that fe­male play­ers are less-equipped to play chess well. But I think it’s a mind­set thing that there are all these tour­na­ments that are fe­male-fo­cused and open events. When you limit your­self to a par­tic­u­lar group of play­ers, your scope of growth is lim­ited.”</p>
    <p>The lack of women at the top is one rea­son why there are sep­a­rate tour­na­ments for women.</p>
    <p>Some women such as Hun­gar­ian grand­mas­ter Ju­dit Pol­gar, who was once ranked world No. 8, have deemed this as sex­ist. Yet Gong be­lieves that it is im­por­tant to have such tour­na­ments and ti­tles to en­cour­age par­tic­i­pa­tion.</p>
    <p>She said: “This is nec­es­sary be­cause fe­males are the mi­nor­ity in the cur­rent chess en­vi­ron­ment. This strat­egy is sim­i­lar to hav­ing age-spe­cific ti­tles and tour­na­ments to en­cour­age younger chil­dren to par­tic­i­pate.”</p>
    <p>Over a decade ago, the SCF tried to com­bine the Un­der-16 cat­e­gory in its Na­tional Age Groups com­pe­ti­tion, but that only re­sulted in girls stay­ing away from that cat­e­gory.</p>
    <p>THINK­ING STEPS AHEAD</p>
    <p>While Liu, a woman Fide mas­ter, thinks it is good that women have a choice to play in the women’s or opens sec­tion, she also be­lieves that it is im­por­tant to en­cour­age all to com­pete and train to­gether.</p>
    <p>The risk man­ager said: “We need to build up the chess scene to have more fe­male play­ers play­ing in the first place and it is also im­por­tant to en­cour­age ho­mo­gene­ity in the train­ing and com­pe­ti­tion en­vi­ron­ment.”</p>
    <p>Gong, who used to be in the Chi­nese na­tional team, feels that Sin­ga­pore should work to­wards cre­at­ing a scene that will al­low play­ers to make a liv­ing by par­tic­i­pat­ing in tour­na­ments. In China, there are pro­fes­sional leagues where play­ers re­ceive ap­pear­ance fees and reg­u­lar pay­outs from their clubs, which are spon­sored by the na­tion.</p>
    <p>Shows like The Queen’s Gam­bit play an im­por­tant role in draw­ing more peo­ple into the game. Chess.com has seen more than 2.35 mil­lion play­ers join its site since the se­ries aired in Oc­to­ber. Goh said: “It dis­abuses the er­ro­neous no­tion of chess be­ing just a game for nerds. I think peo­ple ap­pre­ci­ate the game a lit­tle bit more and the chal­lenges that the game op­poses.”</p>
    <p>While there has been more talk about chess in Sin­ga­pore, it is still too early to tell whether that has re­sulted in an in­crease in par­tic­i­pa­tion. But with hol­i­day chess classes fully booked, Lim is hope­ful.</p>
    <p>“Any in­ter­est in the game of chess is a favourable out­come for us, and we hope that this can be sus­tained re­sult­ing in more par­tic­i­pa­tion in tour­na­ments and maybe even­tu­ally to a ‘Beth Har­mon’ equiv­a­lent,” he said.</p>
    <p>THINK MORE BROADLY</p>
    <p>I think it’s a mind­set thing that there are all these tour­na­ments that are fe­male­fo­cused and open events. When you limit your­self to a par­tic­u­lar group of play­ers, your scope of growth is lim­ited. ’’</p>
