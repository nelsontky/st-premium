    <p>•</p>
    <p>STOCK­HOLM The Euro­pean Union’s disease con­trol agency has joined fran­tic health work­ers to sound the alarm over a coro­n­avirus surge across the con­ti­nent, as the World Health Or­gan­i­sa­tion (WHO) warned of an “ex­po­nen­tial” rise in Covid-19 in­fec­tions.</p>
    <p>Even coun­tries that avoided se­vere out­breaks in Europe’s first wave of con­ta­gion in the spring have watched their case num­bers surge, with Ger­many’s death toll pass­ing 10,000 yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Gov­ern­ments have rein­tro­duced mea­sures to slow the re­newed spread of the virus in na­tions that only weeks ear­lier be­lieved they had tri­umphed over the cri­sis.</p>
    <p>But pop­u­la­tions weary of so­cial iso­la­tion and eco­nomic hard­ship have pushed back against fresh re­stric­tions, with clashes in hard-hit Naples be­tween Ital­ian po­lice and hun­dreds of protesters.</p>
    <p>The con­ti­nent is fac­ing a ma­jor threat to pub­lic health and a “highly con­cern­ing epi­demi­o­log­i­cal sit­u­a­tion”, said Dr An­drea Am­mon, di­rec­tor of the Euro­pean Cen­tre for Disease Preven­tion and Con­trol.</p>
    <p>The agency said all 27 EU coun­tries ex­cept Cyprus, Es­to­nia, Fin­land and Greece fell into a “se­ri­ous con­cern” cat­e­gory, as did Bri­tain, up from just seven a month ago.</p>
    <p>Af­ter Spain be­came the first Euro­pean coun­try to of­fi­cially record a mil­lion Covid-19 cases last week, Prime Min­is­ter Pe­dro Sanchez on Fri­day said the real num­ber was likely more than triple that.</p>
    <p>France fol­lowed Spain past the mil­lion-case mile­stone on Fri­day while Ger­many hit a fresh daily record of nearly 15,000 new cases, with the health au­thor­i­ties urg­ing the pub­lic to fol­low so­cial dis­tanc­ing mea­sures.</p>
    <p>Ur­gent new re­stric­tions on daily life have come into ef­fect in sev­eral na­tions, with France ex­tend­ing a cur­few to cover 46 mil­lion peo­ple.</p>
    <p>Parts of Italy, in­clud­ing the cap­i­tal Rome, went un­der cur­few late on Fri­day, prompt­ing a call to protest on so­cial me­dia that saw hun­dreds of demon­stra­tors in Naples throw ob­jects at po­lice and set rub­bish bins on fire.</p>
    <p>The coun­try is reel­ing from its worst post-war re­ces­sion af­ter a gru­elling two-month na­tional lock­down prompted by one of Europe’s worst out­breaks, and the au­thor­i­ties have so far been re­luc­tant to re­peat the dras­tic quar­an­tine re­stric­tions seen then.</p>
    <p>Wales en­tered a full lock­down on Fri­day evening, a day af­ter Ire­land shut down, while Poland adopted a na­tion­wide “red zone” lock­down man­dat­ing the par­tial clo­sure of pri­mary schools and restau­rants.</p>
    <p>Only Swe­den, which fa­mously re­fused to lock down ear­lier this year, con­tin­ued to stick to its guns de­spite a rise in cases.</p>
    <p>Across the world, Covid-19 has now claimed the lives of 1.1 mil­lion peo­ple and in­fected over 42 mil­lion, with the WHO warn­ing that the North­ern Hemi­sphere was at a crit­i­cal junc­ture.</p>
    <p>“Too many coun­tries are see­ing an ex­po­nen­tial in­crease in Covid-19</p>
    <p>cases and that is now lead­ing to hos­pi­tals and in­ten­sive care units run­ning close to or above ca­pac­ity,” said WHO chief Te­dros Ad­hanom Ghe­breye­sus.</p>
    <p>Bel­gium has seen one of Europe’s dead­li­est per capita out­breaks and has found it­self suf­fer­ing some of the high­est sec­ond-wave in­fec­tion rates in Europe.</p>
    <p>“We’re los­ing. We’re over­whelmed. We’re bit­ter,” said Dr Benoit Mis­set, head of the in­ten­sive care unit at the Univer­sity Hospi­tal in the city of Liege, where sev­eral of his staff are hav­ing to work de­spite be­ing pos­i­tive – if asymp­to­matic – them­selves.</p>
    <p>Work has con­tin­ued on the in­ter­na­tional quest to find a vac­cine for the disease, with clin­i­cal tri­als for one can­di­date de­vel­oped by As­traZeneca and Ox­ford Univer­sity re­sum­ing in the United States on Fri­day, six weeks af­ter a test sub­ject be­came ill.</p>
    <p>US pres­i­den­tial hope­ful Joe Bi­den said that if elected, he would man­date free coro­n­avirus vac­cines for all Amer­i­cans.</p>
    <p>“Once we have a safe and ef­fec­tive vac­cine, it has to be free to ev­ery­one – whether or not you’re in­sured,” he said in a speech lay­ing out his pandemic re­sponse plan just 11 days be­fore the Nov 3 elec­tion.</p>
    <p>The next few months are go­ing to be very tough and some coun­tries are on a dan­ger­ous track. We urge lead­ers to take im­me­di­ate ac­tion, to pre­vent fur­ther un­nec­es­sary deaths, es­sen­tial health ser­vices from col­laps­ing and schools shut­ting again. As I said it in Fe­bru­ary and I’m re­peat­ing it to­day: This is not a drill.</p>
    <p>DR TE­DROS AD­HANOM GHE­BREYE­SUS, World Health Or­gan­i­sa­tion di­rec­tor-gen­eral, in a warn­ing to the world dur­ing a news con­fer­ence on Fri­day.</p>
