    <p>A POS­I­TIVE IN­FLU­ENCE He was a boy of few words but it was al­ways his wish to in­spire oth­ers with his story. Dur­ing his wake, there were many at­ten­dees who came, some of whom we did not even know. MR WIL­LIAM LEE, Raphael’s fa­ther, on his son.</p>
    <p>In the last days be­fore his fi­nal surgery on Nov 12, 12-year-old can­cer pa­tient Raphael Lee had be­gun think­ing about his own death.</p>
    <p>Sens­ing that “some­thing was not quite right”, he asked his mum, Mrs Win­nie Lee, 45, what would hap­pen if her only child died be­fore her. If he did, he hoped she would do­nate his body to sci­en­tific re­search.</p>
    <p>On the day of the surgery, he was cry­ing softly out­side the op­er­at­ing the­atre. “I don’t think I’ve seen him so afraid be­fore,” she said.</p>
    <p>“Just as he was be­ing se­dated to be­gin the op­er­a­tion, he told me, ‘Mummy, I don’t want to lie down, I want to sit down. I want you to hug me’. So that was how he went into deep sleep, and that was the last time we saw him alert and awake,” she added.</p>
    <p>In that poignant mo­ment, said Mrs Lee, no words were shared but the bond be­tween mother and child was strong and heart­felt.</p>
    <p>On the op­er­at­ing ta­ble, Raphael suf­fered from ex­ces­sive blood loss, which re­sulted in brain dam­age. He died the fol­low­ing day.</p>
    <p>Raphael had dealt with var­i­ous can­cers since he was born, as he had Li-Frau­meni Syn­drome, a ge­netic dis­or­der which pre­dis­posed him to a wide range of rare can­cers.</p>
    <p>His fa­ther, Mr Wil­liam Lee, 47, a course man­ager with non-profit hu­man­i­tar­ian or­gan­i­sa­tion St John Sin­ga­pore, also has the syn­drome, and was di­ag­nosed with Stage 2 colon can­cer in Au­gust.</p>
    <p>De­spite be­ing so ill for the last third of his life, Raphael was a cu­ri­ous and de­ter­mined child who read up on his con­di­tion, gen­uinely loved learn­ing and joined var­i­ous clubs in school, where he had many friends.</p>
    <p>After col­lect­ing his son’s PSLE re­sults on Wed­nes­day, Mr Lee had a mo­ment’s re­gret about not post­pon­ing Raphael’s surgery so that he could have seen the re­sults for him­self.</p>
    <p>But Raphael’s biopsy re­sults, which also came back that day, showed there was a chance the can­cer may have spread to other parts of his body.</p>
    <p>“So with that, I think his de­par­ture was timely. It would’ve been more dif­fi­cult for him to re­ceive happy news of his re­sults, only to fight yet an­other wave of can­cer, which he might end up suc­cumb­ing to,” said Mr Lee.</p>
    <p>Raphael’s first op­er­a­tion was at the age of eight months for rhab­domyosar­coma, a rare form of soft tis­sue can­cer, in 2008. After a year of treat­ment, the dis­ease went into re­mis­sion, but resur­faced in 2016.</p>
    <p>That ne­ces­si­tated a sec­ond op­er­a­tion, when he was in Pri­mary 2, for os­teosar­coma, or bone can­cer, in his left fore­arm. He was to lose that arm the fol­low­ing year, to halt the spread of the can­cer.</p>
    <p>After his can­cer came back, and de­spite be­ing so young, Raphael read up on can­cer, the side ef­fects of his fre­quent chemo­ther­apy treat­ments, and quizzed his doc­tors and nurses on the med­i­ca­tions they gave him.</p>
    <p>His par­ents said his in­quis­i­tive mind and gen­uine in­ter­est in learn­ing saw him per­se­vere through the Pri­mary School Leav­ing Ex­am­i­na­tions (PSLE) in Oc­to­ber, in which the Alexan­dra Pri­mary School pupil scored 220 points, with As for math­e­mat­ics and sci­ence, and Bs for English and mother tongue.</p>
    <p>“Maths and sci­ence were his favourite sub­jects in school, and he en­joyed chal­leng­ing him­self with mind-bog­gling maths prob­lems in his free time,” said Mrs Lee, a child­care teacher who quit her job last year to look after her son.</p>
    <p>He was also an avid on­line gamer, and he joined var­i­ous cocur­ric­u­lar ac­tiv­i­ties in school such as the chess club, speech and drama club, and ro­bot­ics club.</p>
    <p>“Ro­bot­ics was some­thing he thor­oughly en­joyed, as it al­lowed him to get cre­ative. He was hop­ing to build some­thing which could be use­ful to him in fu­ture, like a pros­thetic arm,” she added.</p>
    <p>Raphael’s fight­ing spirit and zest for life in­spired his class­mates and other can­cer pa­tients at KK Women’s and Chil­dren’s Hos­pi­tal (KKH).</p>
    <p>“He would go around to en­cour­age the other can­cer pa­tients in his ward, which also earned him the In­spi­ra­tional Pa­tient and Care­giver Award from KKH of 2020,” said Mrs Lee.</p>
    <p>His class­mates re­mem­ber his pluck.</p>
    <p>“I was paired with Raphael for an ad­ven­ture camp in Pri­mary 5, and I re­mem­ber how de­ter­mined he was to com­plete the ob­sta­cle course de­spite the fact that his left arm was am­pu­tated,” said Hugo Tang, 12, Raphael’s class­mate of six years.</p>
    <p>“I sup­ported him through­out the course, and the whole class was watch­ing and cheer­ing for him.”</p>
    <p>An­other class­mate, Je­ston Teo, 12, said he missed his friend very much and wished they could talk on the phone again, as they used to do for hours on end, shar­ing jokes with one an­other.</p>
    <p>No mat­ter how sick Raphael was, he al­ways spared a thought for his loved ones. In the days be­fore his fi­nal op­er­a­tion, Mrs Lee cooked a few of his favourite dishes, but the child was so ill that he had lost most of his ap­petite.</p>
    <p>“Yet, he would still re­as­sure me and tell me, ‘Mummy, I’m sorry I couldn’t fin­ish the food; it’s not that it isn’t nice, it’s just that I’m very full’,” she said.</p>
    <p>One of Raphael’s gifts which Mrs Lee holds clos­est to her heart is a “mes­sage in a bot­tle”. In­side the bot­tle is a sim­ple note that says, “I love you Mama”, with strokes of green, her favourite colour, on the back. He had given it to her be­fore an op­er­a­tion in De­cem­ber last year to re­move his right col­lar­bone, as the op­er­a­tion was go­ing to be a chal­leng­ing one.</p>
    <p>“The mes­sage was so sim­ple but very thought­ful,” she added.</p>
    <p>“He was a boy of few words but it was al­ways his wish to in­spire oth­ers with his story,” said Mr Lee. “Dur­ing his wake, there were many at­ten­dees who came, some of whom we did not even know. But all of them said he was very brave and strong.”</p>
    <p>Ex­plain­ing why the cou­ple had agreed to me­dia in­ter­views and to shar­ing Raphael’s life with other peo­ple, Mr Lee said: “Now that he is gone, per­haps I should be the one (to con­tinue his le­gacy) and in­spire oth­ers on his be­half.”</p>
