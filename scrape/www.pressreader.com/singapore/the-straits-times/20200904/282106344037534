    <p>Newly elected Peo­ple’s Ac­tion Party MP Zhulka­r­nain Ab­dul Rahim (Chua Chu Kang GRC) yes­ter­day spoke about how he, like many other Sin­ga­porean par­ents, dreams of build­ing a stronger and more co­he­sive so­ci­ety for his chil­dren. He also called for more sup­port to be given to fam­i­lies and vul­ner­a­ble groups. Here are ex­cerpts from his maiden speech in Par­lia­ment:</p>
    <p>My speech is in­spired by my sixyear-old son and his love for Lego blocks. Each block is im­por­tant. But if you don’t con­nect them prop­erly, then the en­tire struc­ture may be un­sta­ble. To me, each Sin­ga­porean fam­ily rep­re­sents that build­ing block of our so­ci­ety.</p>
    <p>These blocks may come in dif­fer­ent shapes or colours just like our mul­tira­cial and multi-re­li­gious so­ci­ety. But when con­nected to­gether they are stronger and more beau­ti­ful...</p>
    <p>Sup­port­ing fam­i­lies is cru­cial given the fi­nan­cial and emo­tional stresses that they now face. The eco­nomic cri­sis of to­day may give rise to the so­cial cri­sis of to­mor­row.</p>
    <p>I pro­pose two spe­cific ar­eas of sup­port: in health­care and hous­ing.</p>
    <p>For many fam­i­lies, their com­mon fear is to lose a job, or worse, suf­fer a ma­jor ill­ness... We must con­tinue to re­view how our health­care safety nets work. But we must do this in a fis­cally re­spon­si­ble man­ner.</p>
    <p>How do we re­view and in­crease the lim­its for Medis­ave and MediShield Life to help the fi­nan­cial bur­den now?</p>
    <p>Per­haps we can in­crease the limit on an in­terim ba­sis at least, dur­ing this pan­demic pe­riod...</p>
    <p>Next, on hous­ing: Ac­cord­ing to the Hous­ing Board, from April to June this year, there has been a three­fold in­crease of house­holds fac­ing fi­nan­cial dif­fi­cul­ties in mak­ing their monthly mort­gage pay­ments, com­pared with the same pe­riod last year...</p>
    <p>Late pay­ment charges have been sus­pended un­til the end of this month. I would sug­gest that HDB con­sid­ers ex­tend­ing this un­til the end of this year.</p>
    <p>Now, be­sides fi­nan­cial help, we need to ex­plore other ways and frame­works to ease the men­tal and emo­tional strain on fam­i­lies, to make it eas­ier for fam­ily mem­bers to share the load, and en­sure that fam­i­lies stay strong through this cri­sis, es­pe­cially for those who may need more help...</p>
    <p>A chain is no stronger than its weak­est link. We need an ecosys­tem of stronger con­nec­tions within our com­mu­nity.</p>
    <p>I sub­mit that we have to do two things. First, we have to work to­gether. And then, we have to stay to­gether. To il­lus­trate this, I will refer to the work in end­ing do­mes­tic vi­o­lence and work­ing with fam­i­lies.</p>
    <p>Since the cir­cuit breaker, there is con­cern about the rise in do­mes­tic vi­o­lence cases... How­ever, I would cau­tion that these are only the re­ported cases, the tip of the ice­berg...</p>
    <p>I’m us­ing the term do­mes­tic vi­o­lence be­cause it en­com­passes more than just vi­o­lence be­tween fam­ily mem­bers. Un­der the cur­rent leg­is­la­tion, only fam­ily vi­o­lence is specif­i­cally de­fined.</p>
    <p>Per­haps it is time to broaden the def­i­ni­tion be­yond fam­ily to do­mes­tic vi­o­lence or re­visit the ap­proach in the Fam­ily Vi­o­lence Bill pre­vi­ously pro­posed in 1995.</p>
    <p>Hav­ing said that, I’m also heart­ened that the in­ter-agency task force on do­mes­tic vi­o­lence has been formed... It has con­nected govern­ment agen­cies, the ju­di­ciary and strate­gic com­mu­nity part­ners to ad­dress do­mes­tic vi­o­lence is­sues.</p>
    <p>This is an on­go­ing process. This con­sul­ta­tive method is the way for­ward. Not ev­ery­thing has to be leg­is­lated. I hope the task force can look at how we can make it eas­ier for the dis­creet re­port­ing of do­mes­tic vi­o­lence, in the case of el­derly abuse and for­eign wives...</p>
    <p>Even af­ter work­ing closely to­gether, we need to en­sure that we stay to­gether as one... We need to find ways to not only in­cen­tivise but to also take care of our com­mu­nity part­ners and vol­un­teers, so that more will be en­cour­aged to step for­ward...</p>
    <p>We need to see be­yond the lens of the ben­e­fi­ciary or re­cip­i­ent. We need to look at it from the per­spec­tive of the provider also...</p>
    <p>None of us knows for sure how Sin­ga­pore will look like af­ter this cri­sis right now... If we take care of the build­ing blocks of our so­ci­ety, strengthen the con­nec­tions and cocre­ate and build to­gether, I be­lieve we can ride through this storm – not just sur­viv­ing, but thriv­ing...</p>
    <p>In Par­lia­ment, ev­ery word we say here is recorded for­ever. I urge and have full con­fi­dence that mem­bers of this House will pri­ori­tise peo­ple over po­lar­is­ing pol­i­tics. It must be for the cause, not the ap­plause, the in­ten­tion, not at­ten­tion.</p>
    <p>None of us knows for sure how Sin­ga­pore will look like af­ter this cri­sis right now... If we take care of the build­ing blocks of our so­ci­ety, strengthen the con­nec­tions and co-cre­ate and build to­gether, I be­lieve we can ride through this storm – not just sur­viv­ing, but thriv­ing...</p>
