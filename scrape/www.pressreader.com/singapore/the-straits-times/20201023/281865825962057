    <p>PARIS • The man who de­cap­i­tated a teacher in France for show­ing car­toons of Prophet Muham­mad in class had been in con­tact with a Rus­sianspeak­ing Is­lamist mil­i­tant in Syria, said a source close to the case.</p>
    <p>Seven peo­ple have been charged with com­plic­ity after 18-year-old Chechen Ab­dul­lakh An­zorov killed Mr Sa­muel Paty last Fri­day, in­clud­ing two teenagers who helped him iden­tify the teacher.</p>
    <p>The iden­tity of the ter­ror­ist mil­i­tant in Syria has not yet been es­tab­lished, the source told Agence France-Presse (AFP) yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Le Parisien news­pa­per re­ported that An­zorov’s pre­sumed con­tact had been lo­cated through an IP ad­dress traced back to Idlib, a city in north-western Syria.</p>
    <p>Separately, two women ac­cused of stab­bing two other fe­males wear­ing Mus­lim head­scarves near the Eif­fel Tower in Paris and try­ing to rip off their veils have been charged with as­sault and mak­ing racist slurs, le­gal sources told AFP yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The two ac­cused were drunk when they came across a group of Mus­lim women and chil­dren in the Champ de Mars park at the foot of the Eif­fel Tower.</p>
    <p>The Mus­lim fam­ily com­plained about the other women’s dog, say­ing they felt threat­ened by it.</p>
    <p>In the en­su­ing row, one of the ac­cused pulled out a knife and stabbed two of the veiled women, aged 19 and 40.</p>
    <p>The 40-year-old woman sus­tained six stab wounds and is be­ing treated in hos­pi­tal for a per­fo­rated lung.</p>
    <p>The younger vic­tim was stabbed three times and was also treated in hos­pi­tal but has since been dis­charged.</p>
