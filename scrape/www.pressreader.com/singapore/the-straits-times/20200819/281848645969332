    <p>OSHKOSH • US Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump ques­tioned former vi­cepres­i­dent Joe Bi­den’s men­tal ca­pa­bil­i­ties and mocked Se­na­tor Ka­mala Har­ris of Cal­i­for­nia as an ex­treme lib­eral in three cam­paign rally-like ap­pear­ances on Mon­day as Democrats be­gan their na­tional po­lit­i­cal con­ven­tion nom­i­nally in Mil­wau­kee, but largely on­line.</p>
    <p>In front of Air Force One in Wis­con­sin, which de­liv­ered 10 crit­i­cal elec­toral votes for the Pres­i­dent’s 2016 vic­tory over Hil­lary Clin­ton, he said the 2020 elec­tion was a “fight for the sur­vival of our na­tion and civil­i­sa­tion it­self” and con­demned Mr Bi­den as a pup­pet of the “rad­i­cal left” in the Demo­cratic Party. “You want to crush our econ­omy,” Mr Trump asked the crowd at the Oshkosh air­port, “un­der the crazy so­cial­ist poli­cies of sleepy Joe Bi­den and his boss Ka­mala Har­ris – Ka­mala – and his other boss, Nancy Pelosi – she’s a beauty – and his ruler Bernie San­ders, crazy Bernie, or do you want to quickly re­build the strong­est econ­omy in the his­tory of the world?”</p>
    <p>Mr Trump’s re-elec­tion cam­paign has strug­gled to get trac­tion amid the coro­n­avirus pan­demic that has dev­as­tated the US econ­omy and forced can­cel­la­tions and shut­downs across vast swathes of Amer­i­can life. The Pres­i­dent’s early dis­missals of the virus threat and his ad­min­is­tra­tion’s chaotic re­sponse have helped drive his poll num­bers down to dou­bledigit deficits against Mr Bi­den.</p>
    <p>He point­edly chose Oshkosh, not far from Mil­wau­kee, to counter pro­gramme four days of speeches from Demo­cratic Party stars.</p>
    <p>At as top on Mon­day in Mankato, Min­nesota, he gave an hour-long speech to a small crowd at the air­port, ac­cus­ing Mr Bi­den of want­ing to raise taxes, weaken po­lice de­part­ments, open bor­ders, raise en­ergy costs and lock peo­ple in their homes be­cause of the pan­demic. “He will kill the stock mar­ket,” Mr Trump said. “He will kill every­thing that we’re talk­ing about to­day. You’d also abol­ish im­mi­gra­tion en­force­ment, abol­ish bail, abol­ish the sub­urbs, abol­ish ef­fec­tive polic­ing, abol­ish Amer­i­can en­ergy and abol­ish the Amer­i­can way of life.”</p>
    <p>Ear­lier, he boasted about his “in­cred­i­ble” j ob con­fronting the spread of the virus and falsely said Mr Bid en wanted to“lock all Amer­i­cans in their base­ments for months on end, which would in­flict per­ma­nent ir­re­versible harm on our na­tion’s chil­dren, fam­i­lies health and econ­omy”.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump’s first stop of the day was at the air­port in Min­neapo­lis, where there were protests and vi­o­lence after the death of Mr Ge­orge Floyd at the hands of a po­lice of­fi­cer in the city. He lashed out at Mr Bi­den and other Democrats for en­abling “rad­i­cal left an­ar­chists” who looted parts of Min­neapo­lis. “Ev­ery­one says, ‘ Oh, don’t use that term, rad­i­cal left,” he said. “I go ‘rad­i­cal left an­ar­chists!”</p>
    <p>At an early-morn­ing Fox News in­ter­view, he sug­gested Mr Bi­den’s men­tal ca­pac­ity was lack­ing. “Bi­den is shot. I’m telling you he’s shot. There’s some­thing go­ing on,” he said. “Now with that be­ing said, I don’t un­der­es­ti­mate any­body. Only a fool would do that.”</p>
    <p>He also called Ms Har­ris “a dis­as­ter” and mis­stated her po­si­tions by say­ing “she wants to take away ev­ery­one’s gun. She wants to to­tally ban fos­sil fu­els.”</p>
