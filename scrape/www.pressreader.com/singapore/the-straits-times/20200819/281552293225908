    <p>Amer­i­can en­vi­ron­men­tal­ist John Fran­cis, 74, tells jour­nal­ist Ve­nessa Lee what made him take a vow of si­lence for 17 years and to give up mo­torised trans­port for 22 years in his younger days. He will share his ex­pe­ri­ences at the Sin­ga­pore Mind­ful­ness Con­fer­ence this week­end, when he will be speak­ing live on­line.</p>
    <p>Ob­serv­ing a vow of si­lence for 17 years en­abled en­vi­ron­men­tal­ist John Fran­cis to make peace with him­self.</p>
    <p>Be­sides not speak­ing be­tween 1973 and 1990, the 74-year-old Amer­i­can also did not take mo­tor trans­port for 22 years, from 1972 to 1994.</p>
    <p>The de­ci­sion to walk al­most ev­ery­where was a protest against pol­lu­tion after a col­li­sion of two oil tankers in San Francisco Bay in 1971 left a mas­sive oil spill.</p>
    <p>Al­though he joined vol­un­teers to clean the beach and res­cue sea birds drenched in pe­tro­leum, Dr Fran­cis says he felt partly re­spon­si­ble. He was then driv­ing a Toy­ota Land Cruiser in Cal­i­for­nia, where he used to live.</p>
    <p>Shortly after­wards, in part be­cause he got into ar­gu­ments about his de­ci­sion not to drive, he took a vow of si­lence on his 27th birth­day.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing those years, he trekked and sailed around North and South Amer­ica while earn­ing a Bach­e­lor of Science de­gree, as well as a mas­ter’s de­gree and a doc­tor­ate in en­vi­ron­men­tal stud­ies. He com­pleted his stud­ies by com­mu­ni­cat­ing through pan­tomime, act­ing and writ­ing notes. He has also trekked in places like the Nether­lands and Hangzhou in China.</p>
    <p>He sup­ported him­self do­ing ad­hoc work, such as build­ing boats and play­ing his banjo at clubs, or with schol­ar­ship stipends.</p>
    <p>For a year, he worked with the United States Coast Guard, as­sist­ing in writ­ing reg­u­la­tions after the his­toric Exxon Valdez oil spill in 1989.</p>
    <p>Dr Fran­cis, nick­named the Plan­et­walker, wants to share the lessons he learnt at the Sin­ga­pore Mind­ful­ness Con­fer­ence, where he will be speak­ing live on­line this week­end.</p>
    <p>Or­gan­ised by Brahm Cen­tre and the Na­tional Univer­sity of Sin­ga­pore, the theme of the con­fer­ence, which in­cludes we­bi­nars, work­shops and mind­ful­ness prac­tice ses­sions, is En­hanc­ing Re­silience And Per­for­mance.</p>
    <p>Dr Fran­cis vis­ited Sin­ga­pore a few years ago to give a talk at Stam­ford Amer­i­can In­ter­na­tional School.</p>
    <p>“Dur­ing the jour­ney that I went on, I was lis­ten­ing and not talk­ing, lis­ten­ing to na­ture and to other peo­ple. I was look­ing for my au­then­tic self. Dis­cov­er­ing the per­son that I was meant re­dis­cov­er­ing my child­hood self, the in­ner child that we all have within us. It was a serendip­i­tous dis­cov­ery,” says Dr Fran­cis in an ex­clu­sive video in­ter­view with The Straits Times from his home in New Jersey.</p>
    <p>Al­though his de­ci­sions af­fected im­por­tant re­la­tion­ships – his girl­friend at the time even­tu­ally left him – he found that si­lence was “very free­ing”. Mean­while, not us­ing mo­tor ve­hi­cles be­gan to feel like “a prison”.</p>
    <p>As a young man in his 20s, he re­calls that he thought he “knew every­thing” and had trou­ble lis­ten­ing.</p>
    <p>In con­ver­sa­tion, he kept think­ing how he would say things better than the other per­son and kept want­ing to chime in with his own ob­ser­va­tions. This im­pulse faded after he stopped driv­ing and started walk­ing ev­ery­where.</p>
    <p>He would of­ten walk with his banjo in hand, which he still plays when speak­ing at sem­i­nars.</p>
    <p>In those days, when asked to play, he would be tempted to lie that he had an al­bum out. He has long stopped such show­boat­ing.</p>
    <p>Be­ing “on the out­side of the cul­ture” through those years of si­lence helped him to ac­cept who he was, and to re­ject the “lie” he was liv­ing, he says. “There was a time when I didn’t like who I was.”</p>
    <p>As a child, he re­mem­bers he did not like be­ing black.</p>
    <p>When he was grow­ing up i n Philadel­phia, he saw signs in sleek restau­rants wel­com­ing only white peo­ple; a plac­ard for “coloured” peo­ple in­di­cated al­ter­na­tive din­ing, such as a shack sell­ing hot dogs. He was about six years old when a young neigh­bour, standing next to her mother, said she could not play with him be­cause he was “coloured”.</p>
    <p>His par­ents tried from the be­gin­ning to per­suade him against his quest. They were afraid he would be at­tacked or even killed as a black man walk­ing alone and mute in the streets and wilderness of the US.</p>
    <p>Some­time in the 1970s, Dr Fran­cis faced the threat they had feared.</p>
    <p>When he was trekking in the Cal­i­for­nian moun­tains, an off-duty sher­iff de­manded to know what he was do­ing and pointed a gun at his head.</p>
    <p>“I was in such an al­tered state, after a few years of not speak­ing and want­ing to lis­ten to ev­ery­one. The racism was kind of the story, but what I saw was life and death. I recog­nised death as some­one very fa­mil­iar. The first thing I thought was that I hadn’t done any paint­ing that day, which I usu­ally did,” he says.</p>
    <p>An­other il­lu­mi­nat­ing mo­ment came when he re­alised that en­vi­ron­men­tal con­scious­ness is not only about pol­lu­tion, but also the in­ter­con­nect­ed­ness of peo­ple.</p>
    <p>The Black Lives Mat­ter move­ment, eco­nomic in­equal­ity, sys­tem­atic op­pres­sion of any kind, the Covid-19 pan­demic and cli­mate change, for ex­am­ple, are all in­ter­linked is­sues re­quir­ing pain­ful con­ver­sa­tions and gen­uine co­op­er­a­tion.</p>
    <p>Solv­ing en­vi­ron­men­tal and other prob­lems de­pends on how peo­ple treat one an­other, he says.</p>
    <p>“No mat­ter what we are do­ing, if we are not kind to one an­other, any solutions would lack the power they could pos­si­bly have, un­less we are work­ing to­gether with com­pas­sion,” says Dr Fran­cis, who has writ­ten two books and is writ­ing a third on the his­tory of kind­ness.</p>
    <p>Com­mu­ni­cat­ing with sign lan­guage, mim­ing and some­times us­ing a notebook, he used to re­view and re­new his vow of si­lence on his birth­day every year.</p>
    <p>On the 10th an­niver­sary of his pledge, he shocked his par­ents with a phone call, though his mother – not recog­nis­ing his voice – thought he was a prankster at first.</p>
    <p>Even when teach­ing for sev­eral months while pur­su­ing his post­grad­u­ate stud­ies, he did not speak, though he set ques­tions and quizzes and en­cour­aged his stu­dents’ dis­cus­sions.</p>
    <p>On Earth Day in April 1990, he broke his vow for good.</p>
    <p>“I wanted to re­mind my­self that I wanted to speak about the en­vi­ron­ment,” says Dr Fran­cis, who is the founder of Plan­et­walk, a non-profit en­vi­ron­men­tal aware­ness or­gan­i­sa­tion, and a United Na­tions Good­will Am­bas­sador.</p>
    <p>His mother cried “hal­lelu­jah” at his first words to an as­sem­bled crowd: “Thank you for be­ing here.”</p>
    <p>His fa­ther urged him to start driv­ing again.</p>
    <p>Dr Fran­cis, now a vis­it­ing as­so­ciate pro­fes­sor at the Univer­sity of Wis­con­sin-Madi­son, still opens many of his speeches with the same words.</p>
    <p>He met his psy­chother­a­pist wife, with whom he has two teenage sons, after he started speak­ing again.</p>
    <p>Once, while vis­it­ing the head of a prison in Venezuela, Dr Fran­cis found him­self think­ing ob­ses­sively about how he would es­cape.</p>
    <p>“It dawned on me that I was in a prison of my own mak­ing,” he says.</p>
    <p>He re­flected that even if he did not use mo­tor ve­hi­cles, the food he ate and the clothes on his back were not all lo­cally sourced.</p>
    <p>Not driv­ing did not mean he was “more pure” than oth­ers in try­ing to live sus­tain­ably. This thought ended 22 years of walk­ing.</p>
    <p>In tak­ing roads less trav­elled, Dr Fran­cis has been shrugged off as a lu­natic.</p>
    <p>“I think when­ever some­one is pre­sent­ing some­thing new or dif­fer­ent, there’s go­ing to be peo­ple say­ing: ‘You’re crazy.’ How can you love peo­ple who call you crazy? I can love these peo­ple be­cause they help me de­fine who I am,” he says.</p>
    <p>“If you don’t know who you are, you are sub­ject to them. You re­alise this is who you are, and that re­al­i­sa­tion is what I want for ev­ery­one.”</p>
