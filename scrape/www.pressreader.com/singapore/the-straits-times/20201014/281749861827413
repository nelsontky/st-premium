    <p>Yesterday, SingPost said that let­ter­boxes at nine Hous­ing Board blocks in Red­hill and Lengkok Bahru were found van­dalised in the morn­ing, the sec­ond such in­ci­dent in Sin­ga­pore in two months. The postal ser­vice said they had been forcibly prised open.</p>
    <p>The affected blocks were Blocks 55, 56, 57, 58 and 59 in Lengkok Bahru; Blocks 71 and 72 in Red­hill Road; and Blocks 89 and 90 in Red­hill Close.</p>
    <p>The po­lice have is­sued a crime alert about Bud­get 2020 gro­cery vouch­ers be­ing stolen from let­ter­boxes here.</p>
    <p>Bukit Merah East Neigh­bour­hood Po­lice Cen­tre has high­lighted the prob­lem in a cir­cu­lar.</p>
    <p>It urged res­i­dents to col­lect the vouch­ers from their let­ter­boxes if they have not done so, and to re­port any sus­pi­cious char­ac­ters loi­ter­ing near the let­ter­boxes.</p>
    <p>Radin Mas Con­stituency shared the po­lice cir­cu­lar on its Face­book page on Mon­day, re­mind­ing res­i­dents to se­cure their let­ter­boxes af­ter re­triev­ing their let­ters.</p>
    <p>Yesterday, SingPost said that let­ter­boxes at nine Hous­ing Board blocks i n Red­hill and Lengkok Bahru were found van­dalised in the morn­ing.</p>
    <p>It was the sec­ond such in­ci­dent in Sin­ga­pore in two months.</p>
    <p>The postal ser­vice said they had been forcibly prised open.</p>
    <p>The affected blocks were Blocks 55, 56, 57, 58 and 59 in Lengkok Bahru; Blocks 71 and 72 in Red­hill Road; and Blocks 89 and 90 in Red­hill Close.</p>
    <p>An emer­gency re­sponse crew that was dis­patched found the doors of some let­ter­boxes ajar, and bore scratches, dents and other signs of tam­per­ing, SingPost said.</p>
    <p>The master doors of all nine let­ter­box nests were locked and se­cure.</p>
    <p>SingPost’s checks showed that the van­dal­ism was likely to have oc­curred af­ter a post­man left the area at 1pm on Mon­day.</p>
    <p>Postal staff have re­trieved all the mail in the tam­pered let­ter­boxes and will de­liver the mail to the doorstep of affected res­i­dents, it added.</p>
    <p>In Fe­bru­ary, the Gov­ern­ment an­nounced that lower-in­come Sin­ga­pore­ans aged 21 and above­would re­ceive the gro­cery vouch­ers.</p>
    <p>Last Satur­day, it said the vouch­ers had been mailed out to 150,000 Sin­ga­pore­ans, with a sec­ond round of vouch­ers to be sent in De­cem­ber.</p>
    <p>Each re­cip­i­ent re­ceives $150 in vouch­ers in each round.</p>
    <p>SingPost said it treats mail se­cu­rity as a mat­ter of para­mount im­por­tance, and that such breaches are taken very se­ri­ously.</p>
    <p>“Any in­stance of let­ter­box van­dal­ism or theft will be re­ported to the po­lice ex­pe­di­tiously,” it added.</p>
    <p>The po­lice con­firmed that a re­port has been lodged, and that in­ves­ti­ga­tions are on­go­ing.</p>
