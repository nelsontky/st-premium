    <p>Tech­nol­ogy and in­no­va­tion play a cru­cial role in Sin­ga­pore’s re­sponse to the cur­rent cri­sis, and will be crit­i­cal in eco­nomic re­cov­ery, Deputy Prime Min­is­ter Heng Swee Keat said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Speak­ing at the open­ing of the SG Fin­Tech Fes­ti­val x Switch 2020, he stressed the need for the world to take a more in­clu­sive ap­proach in global re­cov­ery plans, and to speed up the time taken for the last com­pany and worker to ac­cess and ben­e­fit from tech­nol­ogy.</p>
    <p>The coro­n­avirus pan­demic may have dis­rupted the global econ­omy, but tech­nol­ogy and in­no­va­tion could hold the key to re­cov­er­ing from the cri­sis, said Deputy Prime Min­is­ter Heng Swee Keat yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Not only will they help cur­tail the pan­demic, but they will also drive eco­nomic re­cov­ery, he noted in his open­ing ad­dress at the Sin­ga­pore Fin­Tech Fes­ti­val and Sin­ga­pore Week of In­no­va­tion and Tech­nol­ogy 2020 (SFF x Switch 2020) yes­ter­day. But the re­cov­ery should also be in­clu­sive and sus­tain­able, he stressed.</p>
    <p>“In Sin­ga­pore, the tech sec­tor con­tin­ues to be a bright spot for busi­nesses and work­ers,” said Mr Heng, cit­ing how it has cre­ated jobs for work­ers and opened doors to new mar­kets for firms.</p>
    <p>He said the Re­pub­lic can con­trib­ute to global re­cov­ery by in­vest­ing in in­no­va­tion and col­lab­o­rat­ing with the rest of the world. The ben­e­fits of this ap­proach have al­ready been seen dur­ing the pan­demic, with in­ter­na­tional team­work play­ing out in the shar­ing of the virus genome and Ap­ple and Google work­ing to­gether to en­able a broad con­tact-trac­ing plat­form on mo­bile phones, added Mr Heng.</p>
    <p>Fin­tech is one area that Sin­ga­pore is look­ing to grow, he said, adding that the four dig­i­tal bank li­cences is­sued last week will im­prove ac­cess for busi­nesses and in­di­vid­u­als who are cur­rently un­der­served.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, Mr Heng an­nounced the launch of the Asian In­sti­tute of Dig­i­tal Fi­nance, which is hosted by the Na­tional Univer­sity of Sin­ga­pore and backed by the Mon­e­tary Au­thor­ity of Sin­ga­pore and Na­tional Re­search Foun­da­tion.</p>
    <p>One of its first projects is to build a data-shar­ing plat­form that will help lenders make bet­ter credit de­ci­sions and of­fer bet­ter rates.</p>
    <p>“This will im­prove the fi­nanc­ing of small busi­nesses to en­able a stronger post-pan­demic re­cov­ery,” said Mr Heng.</p>
    <p>The in­sti­tute will also help to nur­ture global fin­tech tal­ent for Asia. It will take in its first batch of post­grad­u­ate stu­dents next year.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore’s first ma­jor blockchain re­search and trans­la­tion pro­gramme was also un­veiled yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Mr Heng, who is also Fi­nance Min­is­ter and Co­or­di­nat­ing Min­is­ter for Eco­nomic Poli­cies, said the Covid-19 cri­sis has spot­lighted in­equal­i­ties in many so­ci­eties, and stressed the need for the world to take a more in­clu­sive ap­proach in global re­cov­ery plans.</p>
    <p>“To avoid widen­ing in­equal­ity, we must re­cover from this cri­sis in a man­ner that is in­clu­sive. We must speed up the time that it takes for the last com­pany and worker to ac­cess and ben­e­fit from tech­nol­ogy,” he said.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore is lev­el­ling up the ca­pa­bil­i­ties of its small and medi­um­sized en­ter­prises (SMEs) by help­ing them to adopt dig­i­tal so­lu­tions and scale beyond its own shores, Mr Heng noted.</p>
    <p>The Business sans Bor­ders initiative, which is go­ing live this week, con­nects busi­nesses to other plat­forms around the world, as well as lo­gis­tics and fi­nan­cial ser­vices providers, and will help SMEs find new buy­ers.</p>
    <p>Help­ing SMEs get to grips with the dig­i­tal revo­lu­tion would also cre­ate more op­por­tu­ni­ties for work­ers, Mr Heng said.</p>
    <p>“Just as we in­no­vated to cope with the pan­demic, we must also use tech­nol­ogy and in­no­va­tion to emerge stronger from this cri­sis,” he said.</p>
    <p>More than 60,000 par­tic­i­pants from over 130 coun­tries are ex­pected to at­tend SFF x Switch, which ends on Fri­day.</p>
