    <p>Why Man­power Min­is­ter Josephine Teo got emo­tional</p>
    <p>The Covid-19 pan­demic has put se­vere stress on the work­force, af­fect­ing var­i­ous groups of work­ers, in­clud­ing mid-ca­reer pro­fes­sion­als, man­agers, ex­ec­u­tives and tech­ni­cians who are con­cerned about fair treat­ment and fair op­por­tu­ni­ties.</p>
    <p>Man­power Min­is­ter Josephine Teo’s speech took an emo­tional turn when she teared up as she pledged to help groups of work­ers hit by the cri­sis.</p>
    <p>These work­ers are on her mind as well as that of her team at the Min­istry of Man­power (MOM) every sin­gle day, she said.</p>
    <p>“We are al­ways here, lis­ten­ing to their strug­gles, think­ing deeply about the sup­port that they need, recog­nis­ing the con­straints, ad­just­ing poli­cies in their best in­ter­ests, and find­ing bet­ter ways to pro­tect them against un­fair prac­tices, ul­ti­mately, help­ing them get onto the path of growth in their work lives that they so de­serve.”</p>
    <p>Fol­low­ing a brief pause, she spoke di­rectly to them: “Please know that you are al­ways in our hearts. How­ever long the storm lasts, MOM will walk this jour­ney with you.</p>
    <p>“How­ever tough it may be, we will help you bounce back,” she said, her voice wa­ver­ing as she choked back tears.</p>
