    <p>•</p>
    <p>Liver­pool ended 2020 top of the Premier League and af­ter all the de­fen­sive in­jury prob­lems they have suf­fered that is no mean feat.</p>
    <p>But Jur­gen Klopp’s side need to re­dis­cover their clin­i­cal edge fast.</p>
    <p>For the se­cond time in four days, the Reds had the op­por­tu­nity to ex­tend their lead to five points but fired blanks in a 0-0 draw at strug­gling New­cas­tle on Wed­nes­day.</p>
    <p>On Sun­day, they con­ceded a late equaliser to draw 1-1 at home to lowly West Bromwich Al­bion while ear­lier last month they were also held to a 1-1 draw by Ful­ham, another side bat­tling rel­e­ga­tion.</p>
    <p>With Brighton & Hove Al­bion also deny­ing the league cham­pi­ons vic­tory in another 1-1 stale­mate, they have now dropped eight points against sides in the bot­tom seven in the ta­ble.</p>
    <p>It is not what has come to be ex­pected from a Liver­pool side who churned out vic­to­ries for fun last sea­son even when not fir­ing on all cylin­ders – vir­tu­ally wrap­ping up the ti­tle by the time the Premier League went into a three-month shut­down in March be­cause of the coro­n­avirus pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Against New­cas­tle, they en­joyed 73 per cent pos­ses­sion but Mo­hamed Salah, Sa­dio Mane and Roberto Firmino were un­usu­ally prof­li­gate in front of goal. All three missed chances they usu­ally con­vert and Liver­pool’s fi­nal pass of­ten lacked pre­ci­sion.</p>
    <p>De­spite all that, the Reds fin­ished the year three points clear of Manch­ester United (30) – a po­si­tion Klopp will be sat­is­fied with af­ter los­ing key de­fend­ers Vir­gil van Dijk and Joe Gomez to sea­son-end­ing in­juries early in the cam­paign.</p>
    <p>Even be­fore a ball was kicked, the Ger­man knew that his team would be pushed harder to re­tain their ti­tle than they were last sea­son when they won it by 18 points.</p>
    <p>And with the pan­demic dis­rupt­ing games and caus­ing fix­ture con­ges­tion on top of their in­jury cri­sis, the fact his side have suf­fered only one loss in 16 games speaks vol­umes for the men­tal tough­ness in the squad.</p>
    <p>“The last thing I’m think­ing about is our po­si­tion in the ta­ble at the mo­ment. It’s nice but it doesn’t mean any­thing,” Klopp said.</p>
    <p>“We drew tonight and we are still top of the ta­ble, so that just</p>
    <p>shows how dif­fi­cult the sea­son is for ev­ery­body. When life gives you lemons, make lemon­ade.</p>
    <p>“We have to keep go­ing, next game, Southamp­ton, As­ton Villa, Man United and that’s good we know about our re­spon­si­bil­ity.</p>
    <p>“We didn’t get the re­sult we wanted but it’s not the worst thing in the world, there are worse things hap­pen­ing.”</p>
    <p>His vice-cap­tain James Mil­ner agreed, say­ing: “I think it’s a pos­i­tive but it seems to be at this mo­ment in time that no­body wants to take it by the scruff of the neck. We’ve dropped points, ev­ery­one seems to be drop­ping points.”</p>
    <p>With de­fender Joel Matip now con­firmed out for three weeks with an ad­duc­tor strain, Klopp may have to look for re­in­force­ments this month.</p>
    <p>His side may not have clicked into top gear yet but they also have big play­ers com­ing back from in­jury and that still makes them the team to beat.</p>
    <p>Thi­ago Al­can­tara was the first to re­turn, mak­ing a first ap­pear­ance in over two months at St James’ Park. The Spain in­ter­na­tional came on in the 73rd minute against the Mag­pies.</p>
