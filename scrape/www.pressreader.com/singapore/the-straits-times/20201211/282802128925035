    <p>Chef K Western is a wel­come change from Western food stalls at cof­fee shops and hawker cen­tres, which serve up greasy medi­ocre fare that is mostly fac­tory-sup­plied.</p>
    <p>The chicken burger ($2.80) is a real win­ner. For this price, you get a gen­er­ous piece of grilled bone­less chicken thigh that is fully pre­pared in-house, served in a fluffy bun with crisp let­tuce and a slice of tomato.</p>
    <p>The grilled chicken has a tinge of yel­low that looks and tastes like chicken sa­tay, be­cause of the use of turmeric in the mari­nade. The meat, mar­i­nated overnight, is packed with flavour. Though it has slightly charred edges, it is juicy once you bite into it.</p>
    <p>The burger comes with a splash of house­made Jack Daniel’s sauce, which does not ac­tu­ally con­tain any whiskey but has plenty of blended yel­low onions for nat­u­ral sweet­ness.</p>
    <p>Stall own­ers Koh Kai Kiah, 55, and his wife Chou Sim Mui, 50, put in long hours to pre­pare most of the items from scratch.</p>
    <p>The onion rings ($2.80) are made from hand-sliced yel­low onions.</p>
    <p>Here, you will not find mushy room-tem­per­a­ture coleslaw. The cab­bage and car­rot are sliced by hand to pre­serve their crunch and mois­ture. The coleslaw, served well-chilled and in a dress­ing with just the right amount of tang from the use of white vine­gar, is in­vig­o­rat­ing.</p>
    <p>The mashed potato ($2) is hand­mashed from real potato. While the tex­ture is smooth, it tastes bland.</p>
    <p>The chicken wing with rice ($3.80) com­prises two deep-fried chicken wings with a serv­ing of but­ter rice.</p>
    <p>The wings are flavour­some, but they could be crispier. The but­ter rice is aro­matic and not overly oily.</p>
