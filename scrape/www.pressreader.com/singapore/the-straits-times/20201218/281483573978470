    <p>A Covid-19 vac­ci­na­tion is not risk­free, but the risk is small, and a per­son in fact puts him­self, his loved ones and so­ci­ety at higher risk by not get­ting a jab, ex­perts said yes­ter­day at a we­bi­nar on the A-Z of Covid-19 vac­cines, part of the Straits Times Re­set se­ries.</p>
    <p>“It’s not a mat­ter of say­ing, if I do noth­ing, we’re okay. The weigh­ing is re­ally not be­tween the vac­cine and noth­ing, but the vac­cine and the disease,” said As­so­ciate Pro­fes­sor Lim Poh Lian, di­rec­tor of the high-level iso­la­tion unit at the National Cen­tre for In­fec­tious Dis­eases and a mem­ber of the Min­istry of Health’s Covid-19 Vac­cine Ex­pert Com­mit­tee.</p>
    <p>“To be afraid to (get vac­ci­nated) just be­cause you’re afraid of that very small risk will then ac­tu­ally harm a lot more peo­ple.”</p>
    <p>The ST we­bi­nar was held just days af­ter Prime Min­is­ter Lee Hsien Loong shared Sin­ga­pore’s Covid-19 vac­ci­na­tion plan in a tele­vised ad­dress on Mon­day.</p>
    <p>Hosted by ST se­nior health cor­re­spon­dent Salma Kha­lik, the we­bi­nar also fea­tured Pro­fes­sor Ooi Eng Eong of Duke-NUS Med­i­cal School and Mr Ashish Pal, pres­i­dent of the Sin­ga­pore As­so­ci­a­tion of Phar­ma­ceu­ti­cal In­dus­tries.</p>
    <p>Pub­lic in­ter­est in Covid-19 vac­cines is high now that the Gov­ern­ment has an­nounced that the first ship­ment by United States phar­ma­ceu­ti­cal gi­ant Pfizer and its Ger­man part­ner BioNTech will ar­rive here by the end of the year.</p>
    <p>Given that Covid-19 vac­cines are new and have been pro­duced at record speed, some peo­ple have adopted a wait-and-see ap­proach</p>
    <p>to vac­ci­na­tion, even as Sin­ga­pore is start­ing to fur­ther re­open its econ­omy and bor­ders.</p>
    <p>“The chal­lenge is re­ally that if you don’t take the vac­cine, then you’re not pro­tected,” said Prof Lim, who also heads the Trav­ellers’ Health & Vac­ci­na­tion Clinic at Tan Tock Seng Hospi­tal.</p>
    <p>Should Sin­ga­pore be hit by a sec­ond wave, it will be much harder to re­spond by vac­ci­nat­ing a lot of peo­ple in the mid­dle of it be­cause the health sys­tems will be busy and there may be stricter safe dis­tanc­ing mea­sures in place, she said.</p>
    <p>Prof Lim also said that the Pfizer vac­cine re­quires two shots, and it can take up to five weeks for the full im­mu­nity and pro­tec­tion to kick in.</p>
    <p>While the out­break is cur­rently con­trolled here, there are still im­ported cases, and ev­ery sin­gle im­ported case could spark a clus­ter, she warned.</p>
    <p>Weigh­ing in, Prof Ooi, who is the prin­ci­pal in­ves­ti­ga­tor of a Covid-19 vac­cine that had early stage tri­als con­ducted in Sin­ga­pore, said: “Even if we have stock­piled enough vac­cines to cover the en­tire Sin­ga­pore pop­u­la­tion, rolling out the vac­cine takes time.</p>
    <p>“So, if we wait un­til an epi­demic hits us and then say, ‘OK, now I want a vac­cine,’ well, you may not be in line in time, right?”</p>
    <p>While Sin­ga­pore has zero com­mu­nity cases cur­rently, it comes at a very heavy price as a lot of peo­ple are af­fected by the con­trol mea­sures against Covid-19, said Mr Pal, man­ag­ing di­rec­tor of phar­ma­ceu­ti­cal com­pany Merck Sharp & Dohme in Sin­ga­pore and Malaysia.</p>
    <p>“If you think about the eco­nomic con­trac­tion this has had around the world, I think the only way to kind of start to get this process mov­ing and get the world back in or­der is to al­low the free move­ment of peo­ple,” said Mr Pal.</p>
    <p>Prof Lim said vac­ci­na­tion is “a jour­ney of a thou­sand miles, be­cause we have to get ev­ery­one in the world vac­ci­nated. We’re re­ally only as strong as our weak­est link”.</p>
    <p>“The best minds in the world have worked on this and we’ve paid good money for the vac­cines and we’ve looked at it as hard as we can,” she said.</p>
    <p>As a doc­tor, she will be among the first to get vac­ci­nated. “The proof of the pud­ding is in the eat­ing... It’s our fam­i­lies, it’s our­selves, it’s peo­ple whom we care about on the line. So we would not rec­om­mend it un­less we felt it was ef­fec­tive, safe and of good qual­ity,” she said.</p>
    <p>“We want ev­ery­one to please think about get­ting the vac­cine, not just for your­self, but be­cause you need to pro­tect peo­ple around you.”</p>
