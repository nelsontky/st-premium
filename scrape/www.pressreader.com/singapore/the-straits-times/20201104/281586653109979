    <p>Own­ing dig­i­tal plans to 3D-print a gun or ma­jor gun part will be­come il­le­gal un­der a pro­posed law, which will also sig­nif­i­cantly raise fines for un­li­censed ac­tiv­i­ties in­volv­ing guns and ex­plo­sives. The Bill was in­tro­duced in Par­lia­ment yes­ter­day to ad­dress an evolv­ing se­cu­rity land­scape.</p>
    <p>Own­ing dig­i­tal plans to 3D-print a gun or ma­jor gun part will be­come il­le­gal un­der a pro­posed l aw, which will also sig­nif­i­cantly raise fines for un­li­censed ac­tiv­i­ties in­volv­ing guns and ex­plo­sives.</p>
    <p>The Guns, Ex­plo­sives and Weapons Con­trol Bill was in­tro­duced by Min­is­ter of State for Home Af­fairs Des­mond Tan in Par­lia­ment yes­ter­day to ad­dress an evolv­ing se­cu­rity land­scape.</p>
    <p>The Min­istry of Home Af­fairs (MHA) said in a press re­lease that the threat of ter­ror­ism re­mains high, and flagged the risk of lone wolves or ex­trem­ist groups us­ing weapons to carry out an at­tack in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>Tech­no­log­i­cal changes also pose new chal­lenges to en­force­ment, said the min­istry, point­ing to the emer­gence of tech­nolo­gies such as 3D-print­ing and drones, and greater ac­cess to in­for­ma­tion on­line on man­u­fac­tur­ing il­le­gal guns and weapons.</p>
    <p>MHA also high­lighted the need to more ef­fi­ciently reg­u­late the grow­ing num­ber of arms li­censees in re­cent years, with more li­cences is­sued for sports shoot­ing.</p>
    <p>The new Bill will make it il­le­gal to pos­sess any dig­i­tal blue­print for the man­u­fac­ture of a gun or ma­jor part of a gun with­out au­tho­ri­sa­tion.</p>
    <p>This is to mit­i­gate the threat posed by il­le­gal man­u­fac­tur­ing of guns through 3D-print­ing, said MHA.</p>
    <p>The pro­posed law will also raise the max­i­mum fine for un­li­censed ac­tiv­i­ties in­volv­ing guns and ex­plo­sives from $10,000 now, to $50,000 for in­di­vid­u­als and $100,000 for en­ti­ties.</p>
    <p>This will bring it in line with fines for of­fences in­volv­ing ex­plo­sive pre­cur­sors, due to the com­pa­ra­ble de­gree of harm.</p>
    <p>Ex­plo­sive pre­cur­sors are chem­i­cal sub­stances which can be made into ex­plo­sives with rel­a­tive ease.</p>
    <p>For of­fences re­lat­ing to pro­hib­ited weapons, higher fines of up to $100,000 for in­di­vid­u­als and $200,000 for en­ti­ties will be im­posed, as these are par­tic­u­larly dan­ger­ous due to their de­sign or con­struc­tion.</p>
    <p>Ex­am­ples of such pro­hib­ited items in­clude guns of a cer­tain cal­i­bre, such as anti-tank guns, which are “highly dan­ger­ous and have no day-to-day uses”, said MHA.</p>
    <p>The Sin­ga­pore Po­lice Force (SPF) does not is­sue li­cences for these as they “typ­i­cally do not have le­git­i­mate uses in Sin­ga­pore”.</p>
    <p>The new Bill will also al­low the po­lice to ap­point qual­i­fied in­di­vid­u­als as com­pli­ance of­fi­cers to con­duct in­spec­tions on low-risk arms li­censees. This will free up the po­lice to fo­cus on higher-risk weapons.</p>
    <p>“These com­pli­ance of­fi­cers will be trained and su­per­vised by SPF. The in­ves­ti­ga­tion and en­force­ment of reg­u­la­tory breaches will con­tinue to be han­dled by po­lice of­fi­cers,” said MHA.</p>
    <p>The po­lice will also get more en­force­ment pow­ers, such as hav­ing the right to en­ter and i nspect premises and all ve­hi­cles, air­craft and ves­sels.</p>
    <p>A new class-li­cens­ing regime will be i ntro­duced for cer­tain groups in ac­tiv­i­ties that pose low or mod­er­ate risks, such as users of air guns for sports shoot­ing, and they will not have to be in­di­vid­u­ally li­censed.</p>
    <p>The po­lice will have the au­thor­ity to is­sue li­cences to op­er­ate shoot­ing ranges un­der the new Bill, which will also add dan­ger­ous weapons such as throw­ing stars, knuckle dusters and ma­chetes to the list of reg­u­lated weapons.</p>
    <p>The Gov­ern­ment will have greater flex­i­bil­ity i n han­dling evolv­ing sit­u­a­tions as well.</p>
    <p>If there is se­ri­ous and im­mi­nent threat to life or prop­erty aris­ing from guns and ex­plo­sives-re­lated ac­tiv­ity, the Min­is­ter for Home Af­fairs may i ssue se­cu­rity or­ders valid for up to six months, with a one-time ex­ten­sion of up to six months if nec­es­sary. These in­clude di­rect­ing li­censees to tem­po­rar­ily sus­pend or cease their ac­tiv­i­ties im­me­di­ately, to which they can­not ap­peal against.</p>
    <p>The new Bill will en­sure that penal­ties for of­fences across the var­i­ous guns, ex­plo­sives and weapons-re­lated frame­works are com­men­su­rate with the sever­ity of the crime.</p>
    <p>If the Bill is passed, the Arms and Ex­plo­sives Act, Dan­ger­ous Fire­works Act and Ex­plo­sive Sub­stances Act will be re­pealed. Re­lated laws such as the Arms Of­fences Act and the Cor­ro­sive and Ex­plo­sive Sub­stances and Of­fen­sive Weapons Act will also be amended.</p>
