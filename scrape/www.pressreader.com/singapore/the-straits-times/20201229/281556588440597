    <p>The year started off on a grim note, but it looks like it will end with some good news: Mass Covid-19 in­oc­u­la­tions have started to take off, fu­elling hopes that the pan­demic can fi­nally be reined in.</p>
    <p>Sev­eral health reg­u­la­tors have cleared Pfizer and BioNTech’s Covid-19 vac­cine for emer­gency use, the United States has given the Moderna vac­cine its nod, and other ex­per­i­men­tal vac­cines are inch­ing closer to the fin­ish line.</p>
    <p>“I be­lieve this is the weapon that will end the war,” said Mr An­drew Cuomo, Gover­nor of New York.</p>
    <p>For the vast ma­jor­ity of coun­tries, vac­ci­na­tion will be vol­un­tary.</p>
    <p>Lead­ers have of­fered to be among the first to get vac­ci­nated to dis­pel any doubts about the safety of the vac­cines, with US Vice-Pres­i­dent Mike Pence and Pres­i­dent-elect Joe Bi­den re­ceiv­ing theirs ear­lier this month.</p>
    <p>Many coun­tries are also mak­ing the vac­cines free for all res­i­dents, with pri­or­ity given to front-line per­son­nel, health­care work­ers, se­niors and other vul­ner­a­ble peo­ple.</p>
    <p>But In­done­sia, which has re­ceived its first batch of 1.2 mil­lion doses from China’s Si­no­vac Biotech, plans to first in­oc­u­late its work­ing adults aged 18 to 59 from next year.</p>
    <p>The el­derly, peo­ple with ex­ist­ing health is­sues and preg­nant women are not on its pri­or­ity list as it does not have the data to guar­an­tee that the vac­cine will be safe for them. The Si­no­vac trial shots were tested only on those aged 18 to 59.</p>
    <p>Some gov­ern­ments are tak­ing a wait-and-see ap­proach.</p>
    <p>New Zealand will start vac­ci­nat­ing its pop­u­la­tion only in the sec­ond half of next year, and in Aus­tralia in­oc­u­la­tion will take place from March if the health au­thor­i­ties deem it safe.</p>
    <p>“The sci­en­tific com­mu­nity is still wait­ing to see all of the data for how well each vac­cine pre­vents trans­mis­sion of Covid-19,” said As­so­ci­ate Pro­fes­sor Siouxsie Wiles from Auck­land Univer­sity’s School of Bi­o­log­i­cal Sciences.</p>
    <p>The vac­ci­na­tion of tens of mil­lions of peo­ple will be a mam­moth task. Many coun­tries are rop­ing in vol­un­teers, ready­ing trucks and cargo planes, procur­ing ul­tra-cold stor­age re­frig­er­a­tors and con­duct­ing dis­tri­bu­tion dry runs.</p>
    <p>In­dia’s ex­pe­ri­ence in run­ning the world’s big­gest immunisati­on pro­gramme (it in­oc­u­lates more than 40 mil­lion ba­bies and preg­nant women against 12 dis­eases ev­ery year) will stand it in good stead.</p>
    <p>Three hun­dred mil­lion peo­ple – mostly front-lin­ers and those above 65 – are ex­pected to re­ceive doses in the first phase last­ing un­til July.</p>
    <p>The gov­ern­ment is en­cour­ag­ing states to choose one vac­cine per district to sim­plify the huge un­der­tak­ing. Of­fi­cials may use polling booths and wed­ding halls as vac­ci­na­tion cen­tres. Some 29,000 cold stor­age fa­cil­i­ties will be used to stock the vac­cines. And 154,000 nurses and mid­wives will be de­ployed to ad­min­is­ter the shots.</p>
    <p>Bri­tain, which on Dec 8 be­came the first coun­try to start mass in­oc­u­la­tions, has brought in the mil­i­tary to help. Sta­di­ums and con­fer­ence halls have also been con­verted into vac­ci­na­tion cen­tres.</p>
    <p>Ini­tial doses of the Pfizer vac­cine that ar­rived from Bel­gium are be­ing stored in se­cure sites across the coun­try, where they will be checked for qual­ity be­fore be­ing dis­patched to vac­ci­na­tion hubs.</p>
    <p>The Euro­pean Union has also kicked off its vac­cine roll-out, with Ger­many, Hun­gary and Slo­vakia lead­ing the pack last Satur­day. The Nether­lands, how­ever, had to de­lay its cam­paign un­til Jan 8 ow­ing to is­sues i nclud­ing an un­der­equipped IT sys­tem and a lack of pre­pared scripts for call cen­tre staff. An ear­lier plan for lo­cal doc­tors to give the shots was also scrapped in favour of mass vac­ci­na­tion cen­tres for lo­gis­ti­cal rea­sons.</p>
    <p>In Latin Amer­ica, front-line health­care work­ers in Mex­ico and Chile were among the first to be vac­ci­nated against Covid-19 on Christ­mas Eve.</p>
    <p>In In­done­sia, ex­perts such as epi­demi­ol­ogy pro­fes­sor Pandu Riono from the Univer­sity of In­done­sia say vac­ci­nat­ing just half of its pop­u­la­tion of 268 mil­lion might take up to four years.</p>
    <p>“The gov­ern­ment thinks the vac­cine is the quick so­lu­tion. But the vac­cine it­self doesn’t work if you don’t suc­cess­fully de­liver it to the peo­ple,” he told the Fi­nan­cial Times, not­ing In­done­sia’s size and un­der­de­vel­oped trans­port sys­tem.</p>
    <p>In Malaysia, ex­perts have pointed out that the com­plex re­quire­ments of the Pfizer vac­cine, such as su­per-cold stor­age, will be an ob­sta­cle as mi­nus 70 deg C freez­ers are not eas­ily avail­able.</p>
    <p>“For re­mote clin­ics in Sabah and Sarawak, this is go­ing to be an even big­ger chal­lenge,” Univer­siti Malaya epi­demi­ol­o­gist Awang Bulgiba Awang Mahmud told The Star.</p>
    <p>And then there are wor­ries that or­gan­ised crime groups might tar­get the vac­cines for theft.</p>
    <p>“It is the most valu­able as­set on earth right now,” Ms Lisa Forte, a for­mer Bri­tish counter-in­tel­li­gence em­ployee and a part­ner at cy­ber-se­cu­rity firm Red Goat, told The New York Times.</p>
    <p>“Nat­u­rally, this will at­tract highly skilled cy­ber crim­i­nals, crim­i­nal groups and state ac­tors.”</p>
    <p>Spa­niard Luis Sac­ristan, 42, told The Straits Times that he is look­ing for­ward to get­ting the vac­cine.</p>
    <p>“I will take the vac­cine be­cause it of­fers pro­tec­tion for my son. It’s like a shield from the peo­ple clos­est to him to make sure he is safe.”</p>
    <p>His views are con­sis­tent with sur­veys re­flect­ing large num­bers of peo­ple who want to be im­mu­nised.</p>
    <p>An Oc­to­ber Ip­sos sur­vey of over 18,000 adults in 15 coun­tries found that 73 per cent would get a Covid-19 vac­cine. Re­search pub­lished by the jour­nal Na­ture also noted that 71.5 per cent of 13,426 re­spon­dents i n 19 coun­tries said “they would be very or some­what likely to take a Covid-19 vac­cine”.</p>
    <p>Some are hes­i­tant to get in­oc­u­lated, though, cit­ing con­cerns about side ef­fects and vac­cines mov­ing too quickly through tri­als.</p>
    <p>Re­ports of al­ler­gic re­ac­tions have al­ready cropped up in the US and Bri­tain, bring­ing warn­ings that the vac­cines may not be suit­able for peo­ple with a his­tory of suf­fer­ing ana­phy­laxis when ex­posed to in­gre­di­ents in the shots.</p>
    <p>“I will prob­a­bly give it some time, prob­a­bly un­til the end of 2021, to see the ef­fec­tive­ness of the vac­cine be­fore ac­tu­ally get­ting it,” said Ms Dym­phna Lan­ju­ran, 38, an artist-cu­ra­tor and gal­lerist in Malaysia. “The virus may mu­tate and there is no guar­an­tee the vac­cine will be ef­fec­tive (against the mu­tated virus).”</p>
