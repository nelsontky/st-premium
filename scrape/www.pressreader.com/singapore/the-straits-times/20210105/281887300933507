    <p>In­done­sia’s cap­i­tal city has ex­tended its Covid-19 curbs, called the tran­si­tion par­tial lock­down, for the next two weeks as it tries to pre-empt an ex­pected surge in coro­n­avirus in­fec­tions fol­low­ing Christ­mas and New Year’s Eve gath­er­ings and travel.</p>
    <p>Jakarta’s 98 coro­n­avirus re­fer­ral hos­pi­tals, mean­while, have con­tin­ued to re­port that beds are nearly at full oc­cu­pancy. These 98 hos­pi­tals had 87 per cent of their iso­la­tion wards oc­cu­pied. These wards have 6,663 beds for treat­ing Covid-19 cases.</p>
    <p>The tran­si­tion par­tial l ock­down will be ex­tended to Jan 17, and in­cludes re­stric­tions on so­cial gath­er­ings such as lim­it­ing crowds to five peo­ple.</p>
    <p>Ac­tive Covid-19 cases in Jakarta have shown an in­creas­ing trend and were recorded at 15,471 cases on Satur­day, an 18 per cent rise com­pared with 13,066 on Dec 20, ac­cord­ing to mu­nic­i­pal govern­ment data.</p>
    <p>“This per­cent­age in­crease in ac­tive cases mer­its cau­tion, es­pe­cially as we ex­pect a (fur­ther) rise fol­low­ing Christ­mas and New Year’s Eve,” Ms Widyas­tuti, head of Jakarta’s health depart­ment, said in a state­ment on Sun­day.</p>
    <p>Deemed a Covid-19 red zone, Jakarta im­posed a par­tial lock­down on April 10 for the first time. This was partly eased in early June into what was called a tran­si­tion par­tial lock­down.</p>
    <p>Jakarta im­posed the “emer­gency brake pol­icy”, equiv­a­lent to Sin­ga­pore’s cir­cuit breaker, be­tween mid-Septem­ber and midOc­to­ber. The cap­i­tal has since been on the tran­si­tion par­tial lock­down again since mid-Oc­to­ber.</p>
    <p>In­done­sia had pre­vi­ously seen cases spik­ing fol­low­ing long hol­i­day pe­ri­ods, such as a five-day week­end be­tween Oct 28 and Nov 1. The ex­pected rise this time would be dif­fer­ent how­ever, as it may hap­pen when hos­pi­tal bed oc­cu­pancy has nearly reached full ca­pac­ity. This calls for stricter mea­sures, say ob­servers.</p>
    <p>Still, Jakarta of­fi­cials have shown re­luc­tance to go back to the stricter emer­gency brake pol­icy as lower-in­come res­i­dents are no longer likely to com­ply as their in­comes have long been af­fected.</p>
    <p>Dr Adi Sa­songko, who teaches pub­lic health cour­ses at the Univer­sity of In­done­sia, said stricter mea­sures do not work in In­done­sia, but the au­thor­i­ties may step up en­forc­ing sanc­tions and fines on peo­ple who do not wear masks or wear them im­prop­erly.</p>
    <p>“Full lock­down mea­sures work in China be­cause its au­thor­i­tar­ian govern­ment can im­pose stern mea­sures. It doesn’t work in In­done­sia,” Dr Adi told The Straits Times.</p>
    <p>Like other ci­ties across the ar­chi­pel­ago, Jakarta is hop­ing the na­tion­wide Covid-19 vac­ci­na­tion pro­gramme, which may start in the mid­dle of this month, would curb the spread of the virus. Na­tion­wide dis­tri­bu­tion of a vac­cine de­vel­oped by Chi­nese firm Si­no­vac Biotech be­gan on Sun­day. The dis­tri­bu­tion ex­er­cise comes af­ter state vac­cine pro­ducer Bio Farma re­ceived 1.2 mil­lion doses of the vac­cine on Dec 6 and 1.8 mil­lion doses on Dec 31.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, the Jakarta govern­ment is adding more beds to Covid-19 iso­la­tion wards to bring the num­ber to 7,379, ac­cord­ing to Ms Widyas­tuti. This would be a nearly 11 per cent in­crease.</p>
