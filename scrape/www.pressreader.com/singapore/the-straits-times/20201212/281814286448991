    <p>Hong Kong has struck deals for 15 mil­lion Covid-19 vac­cine doses from two front-run­ner com­pa­nies and will re­ceive the first batches be­gin­ning next month, Chief Ex­ec­u­tive Car­rie Lam said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The Asian fi­nan­cial hub will buy 71/ mil­lion doses of the mRNA shot from Pfizer-BioNTech, and 71 mil­lion doses of a vac­cine from Chi­nese de­vel­oper Si­no­vac Biotech, said Mrs Lam. The gov­ern­ment is also in talks with As­traZeneca for 71/ mil­lion doses.</p>

    <p>Hong Kong will re­ceive Si­no­vac’s vac­cine from next month, and the Pfizer-BioNTech doses from the first quar­ter of next year.</p>
    <p>“We plan to buy enough doses for twice the size of our pop­u­la­tion,” Mrs Lam said. “If the vac­cine needs two doses, we will buy 30 mil­lion doses.”</p>
    <p>The an­nounce­ment will likely soothe Hong Kong res­i­dents, who are con­cerned that the city is fall­ing be­hind re­gional peers in vac­cine pro­cure­ment, even as re­stric­tions are tight­ened again to fight a fourth wave of in­fec­tions.</p>
    <p>While its Covid-19 out­break is not as alarm­ing as those in many global hot spots, the city of 7.5 mil­lion peo­ple has been plagued by re­peated resur­gences. So­cial dis­tanc­ing rules, in­clud­ing school clo­sures, are in place again. The flareup has also de­layed a key travel bub­ble with Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>Hong Kong recorded 86 new in­fec­tions yes­ter­day, bring­ing its to­tal to 7,372. Of the new cases, 81 were lo­cal trans­mis­sions.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, Shang­hai Fo­sun Phar­ma­ceu­ti­cal Group, which holds the rights to mar­ket the Pfizer-BioNTech vac­cine in main­land China, Hong Kong and Ma­cau, plans to ap­ply to the Hong Kong reg­u­la­tor for ap­proval as soon as next week af­ter the United States Food and Drug Ad­min­is­tra­tion green­lights it.</p>
    <p>Mrs Lam said in her pol­icy ad­dress last month that the cen­tral gov­ern­ment in Bei­jing will en­sure Hong Kong has suf­fi­cient sup­ply of Covid-19 vac­cines, and will re­serve a cer­tain amount of vac­cines de­vel­oped in the main­land for use in the city if nec­es­sary.</p>
    <p>The gov­ern­ment also plans to pro­vide free Covid-19 vac­cines to the pub­lic on a vol­un­tary ba­sis when they are avail­able.</p>
    <p>Three mil­lion peo­ple are ex­pected to be vac­ci­nated first, in­clud­ing med­i­cal work­ers, el­derly peo­ple, pa­tients with chronic dis­eases and care-home work­ers.</p>
