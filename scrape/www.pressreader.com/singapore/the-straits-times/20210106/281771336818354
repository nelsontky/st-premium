    <p>SEOUL • Iran de­nied yes­ter­day it was us­ing a South Korean ship and its crew as hostages, a day af­ter it seized the tanker in the Gulf while press­ing a de­mand for Seoul to re­lease US$7 billion (S$9.22 billion) in funds frozen un­der US sanc­tions.</p>
    <p>The seizure of the MT Hankuk Chemi and its 20-mem­ber crew near the strate­gic Strait of Hor­muz has been seen as an at­tempt by Teheran to as­sert its de­mands, just two weeks be­fore US Pres­i­den­t­elect Joe Bi­den takes of­fice.</p>
    <p>Iran wants Mr Bi­den to lift sanc­tions im­posed by out­go­ing Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump. Teheran’s crit­ics have long ac­cused it of cap­tur­ing ships and for­eign pris­on­ers as a way of gain­ing lever­age in ne­go­ti­a­tions.</p>
    <p>“We’ve be­come used to such al­le­ga­tions,” Ira­nian gov­ern­ment spokesman Ali Ra­biei said. “But if there is any hostage-tak­ing, it is Korea’s gov­ern­ment that is hold­ing US$7 billion, which be­longs to us, hostage on base­less grounds.”</p>
    <p>South Korea sum­moned the Ira­nian am­bas­sador, called for the ship to be re­leased and said it was dis­patch­ing a del­e­ga­tion to Iran to dis­cuss it. Iran says the ship was held over en­vi­ron­men­tal vi­o­la­tions.</p>
    <p>South Korea, like other coun­tries, is re­quired to limit Iran’s ac­cess to its fi­nan­cial sys­tem un­der the United States sanc­tions, which were im­posed by Mr Trump af­ter he aban­doned a nu­clear agree­ment reached with Iran un­der his pre­de­ces­sor Barack Obama.</p>
    <p>Iran says the sanc­tions are il­le­gal and have hurt its econ­omy, in­clud­ing its abil­ity to re­spond to the worst out­break of Covid-19 in the Mid­dle East.</p>
    <p>South Korea’s For­eign Min­is­ter Kang Kyung-wha said yes­ter­day she was mak­ing diplo­matic ef­forts to se­cure the re­lease of the tanker and had made con­tact with her coun­ter­part in Teheran.</p>
    <p>Iran’s am­bas­sador in Seoul, Mr Saeed Badam­chi Shabestari, told re­porters that “all of (the crew) are safe”. In ad­di­tion to a South Korean del­e­ga­tion ex­pected to go to Iran as soon as pos­si­ble to try to free the ship, South Korea’s ViceFor­eign Min­is­ter Choi Jong-kun is sched­uled to visit Iran on Sun­day.</p>
    <p>Ira­nian state TV cited a Teheran gov­ern­ment of­fi­cial as say­ing the visit had been sched­uled ear­lier, to dis­cuss the frozen funds.</p>
    <p>The ship’s Bu­san-based op­er­a­tor Taikun Ship­ping said there was no in­di­ca­tion be­fore the ves­sel was seized that the Ira­nian au­thor­i­ties were probing pos­si­ble vi­o­la­tions of en­vi­ron­men­tal rules.</p>
    <p>“If it re­ally was ma­rine pol­lu­tion, as they say, the coast­guard was sup­posed to ap­proach the ship first,” said Taikun’s man­age­ment di­rec­tor Lee Chun-hee, who added that armed sol­diers ap­proached the crew in­stead.</p>
    <p>Last Sun­day, the Tehran Times news­pa­per re­ported that Iran was hop­ing to ne­go­ti­ate an agree­ment to use the frozen funds to “barter” for Covid-19 vac­cine doses and other com­modi­ties.</p>
