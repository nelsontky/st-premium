    <p>The At­tor­ney-Gen­eral’s Cham­bers (AGC) will se­ri­ously con­sider in­ves­ti­gat­ing al­le­ga­tions of per­jury or other se­ri­ous of­fences should such find­ings arise in court-is­sued judg­ments or de­ci­sions in le­gal pro­ceed­ings, Min­is­ter for Home Af­fairs and Law K. Shan­mugam said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>This fol­lows the highly pub­li­cised saga in­volv­ing do­mes­tic worker Parti Liyani, whose for­mer em­ployer’s son was deemed by a High Court judge, in the ap­peal, to have been dis­hon­est in his tes­ti­mony at her trial for theft.</p>
    <p>Mr Shan­mugam high­lighted in Par­lia­ment Mr Karl Liew’s an­swers at the trial, which were in­con­sis­tent to the ex­tent that the High Court judge be­lieved him to be dis­hon­est and dis­re­garded his en­tire ev­i­dence against Ms Parti.</p>
    <p>Among some of his more ques­tion­able state­ments was his claim to have pur­chased and owned a pink knife, which he said he bought be­fore 2002. It was later shown to have likely been man­u­fac­tured after that date, and Mr</p>
    <p>Liew con­ceded this in court.</p>
    <p>Fol­low­ing the case, the AGC has de­cided that, hence­forth, it will con­sider whether there should be fur­ther investigat­ions or pro­ceed­ings for of­fences pointed out in a court judg­ment or de­ci­sion, said Mr Shan­mugam.</p>
