    <p>The Fam­ily Justice Courts (FJC) is plan­ning to start a pilot pro­gramme where the same team of judges, me­di­a­tors, coun­sel­lors and other pro­fes­sion­als will work to­gether with a cou­ple from the start to the end of their di­vorce process .</p>
    <p>Re­fer­ring to the Multi-Dis­ci­plinary Team pilot pro­gramme ex­pected to start in the third or fourth quar­ter this year, the FJC spokesman said: “The pilot seeks to re­frame fam­ily lit­i­ga­tion from be­ing ad­ver­sar­ial and rights-fo­cused, to be­ing prob­lem-solv­ing and so­lu­tions-fo­cused.”</p>
    <p>She ex­plained that in di­vorce pro­ceed­ings, the is­sues are less about the rights and wrongs, but more about hav­ing to ad­dress the con­se­quences of fam­ily break­down and help­ing fam­i­lies to move for­ward.</p>
    <p>For a start in the pilot, the FJC will fo­cus on cou­ples em­broiled in “high con­flict” cases such as when there are com­plex child-re­lated is­sues or mul­ti­ple court pro­ceed­ings.</p>
    <p>The Multi-Dis­ci­plinary Team will pro-ac­tively man­age the case and bring in ap­pro­pri­ate court pro­cesses and spe­cial­ist ser­vices such as those found in the com­mu­nity as early as pos­si­ble.</p>
    <p>The spokesman said: “Pro-ac­tive man­age­ment of the case will be done to re­duce ac­ri­mony by en­sur­ing that par­ties only file nec­es­sary ap­pli­ca­tions.”</p>
    <p>The pilot will last for about a year, after which it will be re­viewed to see which as­pects of the project can be ap­plied more widely.</p>
    <p>Lawyer Dorothy Tan said most cases now do not have a fixed team of judges and other pro­fes­sion­als.</p>
    <p>Hav­ing a fixed team means that the pro­fes­sion­als have a deeper un­der­stand­ing of the fam­ily and is­sues in­volved and deeper col­lab­o­ra­tion to han­dle the case.</p>
    <p>She said: “This is a more tai­lored ap­proach to re­duce the ac­ri­mony and to bet­ter deal with the is­sues at hand.”</p>
    <p>The Multi-Dis­ci­plinary Team is part of the ther­a­peu­tic justice fo­cus which the FJC’s Pre­sid­ing Judge Deb­bie Ong stressed in its Work­plan 2020.</p>
    <p>Ther­a­peu­tic justice re­places the ad­ver­sar­ial ap­proach, with one that is prob­lem-solv­ing and fam­i­lies are sup­ported holis­ti­cally to help them cope with the fall­out from the mar­i­tal break­down.</p>
    <p>Justice Ong said: “It is known that a party fac­ing di­vorce can be deeply af­fected by fear – fear of los­ing one’s chil­dren; fear of not be­ing able to sur­vive after the failed re­la­tion­ship whether emo­tion­ally or fi­nan­cially; fear, be­cause one’s self­i­den­tity it­self is threat­ened.</p>
    <p>“Anx­i­ety, fear and other emo­tions af­fect one’s ca­pac­ity to make good, ra­tio­nal de­ci­sions.</p>
    <p>“Par­ties should be sup­ported in their jour­ney of let­ting go. Not let­ting go is a huge ob­sta­cle to mov­ing on. Par­ties should be as­sisted with de­vel­op­ing their skills to re­solve their own dis­putes, to co-par­ent after di­vorce, to be fa­mil­iar with how to ac­cess ap­pro­pri­ate sup­port ser­vices.”</p>
    <p>Par­ties should be sup­ported in their jour­ney of let­ting go. Not let­ting go is a huge ’’ ob­sta­cle to mov­ing on.</p>
