    <p>For­mer na­tional wa­ter polo cap­tain and coach Tan Eng Bock died yes­ter­day morn­ing af­ter suf­fer­ing a stroke. He was 84.</p>
    <p>Along with his broth­ers Eng Chai and Eng Liang, who were also part of the na­tional team, he ex­celled in the sport. He cap­tained the na­tional team to their first South-east Asian Penin­su­lar (Seap) Games ti­tle in 1965, start­ing a glo­ri­ous un­de­feated run that ended only last year.</p>
    <p>Be­sides be­ing a three-time Seap Games win­ner (1967 and 1969 too), he was also an Asian Games gold medal­list in 1954 and an Olympian at the 1956 Mel­bourne Games.</p>
    <p>Af­ter re­tir­ing from the sport, Tan went on to helm the na­tional team for over 20 years. His decades-long ded­i­ca­tion to the sport earned him the name “Mr Wa­ter Polo”.</p>
    <p>He was also ap­pointed deputy chef de mis­sion for Sin­ga­pore’s 1988, 1996 and 2000 Olympic del­e­ga­tions.</p>
    <p>Still in shock, Eng Liang, a vet­eran sports ad­min­is­tra­tor, paid trib­ute to his brother.</p>
    <p>The 83-year-old said: “Our re­la­tion­ship is not just as broth­ers, but also com­rades in arms in the wa­ter polo and swim­ming worlds.</p>
    <p>“Eng Bock is very close to me be­cause we’ve done a lot of things to­gether. We worked to­gether all the time in the wa­ter polo and swim­ming are­nas, of which I have great re­spect for him, his ea­ger­ness, com­mit­ment, ded­i­ca­tion to­wards wa­ter polo.”</p>
    <p>Eng Chai, the el­dest brother, died just last month. He was 86.</p>
    <p>Min­is­ter for Cul­ture, Com­mu­nity and Youth Ed­win Tong noted the in­flu­ence Tan’s fam­ily had in nur­tur­ing his in­ter­est in wa­ter polo in a Face­book post en­ti­tled “Good­bye, Mr Wa­ter Polo”.</p>
    <p>He added: “Mr Tan’s legacy as a player and men­tor will be re­mem­bered by the sport fra­ter­nity. He will con­tinue to be an in­spi­ra­tion and role model for fu­ture gen­er­a­tions to come.”</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore Na­tional Olympic Coun­cil pres­i­dent Tan Chuan-Jin, who was also sad­dened by the news, said: “He was a stal­wart and de­voted leader, hav­ing con­trib­uted more than half of his life to Sin­ga­pore sport and wa­ter polo.</p>
    <p>“As a firm dis­ci­plinar­ian, he con­tin­ued to coach for decades af­ter re­tir­ing as an ath­lete. His ded­i­ca­tion is un­par­al­leled and his legacy will live on in the many lives he has touched.”</p>
    <p>Eric Song, who was deputy chef de mis­sion for the 2000 Syd­ney Games and him­self a long-time sports ad­min­is­tra­tor, de­scribed Tan as an af­fa­ble per­son who was the life of any gath­er­ing.</p>
    <p>Call­ing Tan his men­tor, Song said: “With him there was al­ways laugh­ter and he cared a lot for friends.</p>
    <p>“He has per­son­ally called me many times to check that I am okay and would of­fer valu­able nuggets of ad­vice. Be­neath his boom­ing voice, he was a very hum­ble and down-to-earth per­son.”</p>
    <p>For­mer na­tional wa­ter polo play­ers re­called how Tan would al­ways ask af­ter them.</p>
    <p>Sport Sin­ga­pore chief ex­ec­u­tive Lim Teck Yin, a six-time SEA Games gold medal­list, said: “His first words to me were to en­cour­age my love for the game.</p>
    <p>“His em­pha­sis on be­ing proud to play for the love of the game and for coun­try res­onated strongly with me. He was ex­em­plary in serv­ing through wa­ter polo for many years.”</p>
    <p>Tan ini­tially came across as some­one who was very strict to for­mer na­tional wa­ter polo vice-cap­tain Yip Ren Kai, but with time, Yip be­gan to see him as a fa­ther fig­ure, who shared his life ex­pe­ri­ences with them.</p>
    <p>Yip, a three-time SEA Games cham­pion, said: “I’ll miss him for who he is. Sin­ga­pore sport has lost a very good men­tor.”</p>
    <p>As a po­lice of­fi­cer, Tan also earned many ac­co­lades. He rose to be­come As­sis­tant Com­mis­sioner of Po­lice be­fore re­tir­ing in the early 1990s.</p>
    <p>Along the way, he re­ceived a Pub­lic Ad­min­is­tra­tion Medal (Sil­ver) in 1981, a State Long Ser­vice Medal the fol­low­ing year and a Pub­lic Ser­vice Star in 1986 for his years of dis­tin­guished ser­vice.</p>
    <p>Tan is sur­vived by his wife Jenny, three sons Matthew, Mark and Mitchell, and three grand­chil­dren.</p>
    <p>The wake will be held at the Sin­ga­pore Fu­neral Par­lour in Tampines and the fu­neral will take place at Mandai Cre­ma­to­rium, Hall 2 on Thurs­day.</p>
