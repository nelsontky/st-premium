    <p>LOS ANGELES • World No. 3 Justin Thomas yes­ter­day said he was deeply apolo­getic after us­ing a ho­mo­pho­bic slur dur­ing the third round of the Sen­try Tour­na­ment of Cham­pi­ons in Hawaii the pre­vi­ous day.</p>
    <p>The Amer­i­can, who is the de­fend­ing cham­pion at the US$6.7 mil­lion (S$8.9 mil­lion) event, missed a five-foot putt on the fourth hole after which he ut­tered the slur which was picked up by a tele­vi­sion mi­cro­phone.</p>
    <p>“There’s j ust no ex­cuse,” the 27-year-old told Golf Channel.</p>
    <p>“There’s ab­so­lutely no rea­son for me to say any­thing like that. It’s ter­ri­ble. It’s not the kind of per­son that I am. I need to do bet­ter. I deeply apol­o­gise to any­one and ev­ery­body who I of­fended and I’ll be bet­ter be­cause of it.”</p>
    <p>Thomas fired an ea­gle and six birdies on Satur­day for a five-un­der 68. He went into yes­ter­day’s fi­nal round in a tie for fifth place at 17-un­der 202, four shots be­hind lead­ers and com­pa­tri­ots Ryan Palmer (64) and Har­ris English (66).</p>
    <p>Sep­a­rately, Jor­dan Spi­eth has re­port­edly met noted coach Butch Har­mon as the 27-year-old at­tempts to re­gain his form.</p>
    <p>The for­mer top-ranked golfer, who has dropped to No. 84, is still with long-time coach Cameron Mc</p>
    <p>Cormick. How­ever, the Amer­i­can re­cently worked with Har­mon for val­i­da­tion “that he is on the right path” with his swing changes, ac­cord­ing to Golf Di­gest.</p>
    <p>The three-time Ma­jor cham­pion has not won since claim­ing the Open Cham­pi­onship in 2017 and had only two top-10 fin­ishes last year, fail­ing to fin­ish bet­ter than a tie for 46th in any of the three Ma­jors.</p>
    <p>Har­mon is best known for his work with 15-time Ma­jor win­ner Tiger Woods from 1993 to 2004.</p>
    <p>He has also worked with Phil Mick­el­son, Dustin John­son and Rickie Fowler be­fore re­tir­ing from trav­el­ling on the PGA Tour in 2019.</p>
