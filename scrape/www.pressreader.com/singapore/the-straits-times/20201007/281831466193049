    <p>WASHINGTON • Vis­i­tors to the White House will no­tice a makeshift sign taped to the door of the James S. Brady Press Brief­ing Room, the en­try point for the re­porters who reg­u­larly cover US Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump and his ad­min­is­tra­tion.</p>
    <p>It reads: “Masks re­quired be­yond this point. Please wear masks over both your nose and mouth at all times.” The sign was not put up by the White House. The cor­re­spon­dents had to do it them­selves.</p>
    <p>Through­out a pan­demic that has now landed squarely in the West Wing, Trump of­fi­cials – who rou­tinely shunned masks – de­clined to in­sti­tute thor­ough safety pro­to­cols to pro­tect the White House press corps, ac­cord­ing to in­ter­views with re­porters who now face the prospect of a rapidly es­ca­lat­ing Covid-19 out­break in their daily workspace.</p>
    <p>“The only place on the White House grounds where a mask has been re­quired is the White House press area, and the only peo­ple who have rou­tinely vi­o­lated that rule have been White House staff,” Mr Jonathan Karl, ABC’s chief White House correspond­ent, said in an in­ter­view.</p>
    <p>Re­porters who trav­elled with Mr Trump over the past week learnt that his ad­viser Hope Hicks had tested pos­i­tive only af­ter read­ing press re­ports on Thurs­day.</p>
    <p>Many had trav­elled near Ms Hicks, and had spent time with fam­ily and friends in the days since.</p>
    <p>At least three White House cor­re­spon­dents have tested pos­i­tive for the virus in re­cent days, in­clud­ing a New York Times reporter, Mr Michael Shear.</p>
    <p>All had re­cently cov­ered of­fi­cial White House events or trav­elled on Air Force One. Other re­porters with po­ten­tial ex­po­sure are be­ing tested daily or self-quar­an­tin­ing as a pre­cau­tion.</p>
    <p>“I felt safer re­port­ing in North Korea than I cur­rently do re­port­ing at The White House,” a CBS News correspond­ent, Mr Ben Tracy, wrote on Twit­ter on Mon­day. “This is just crazy.”</p>

    <p>I felt safer re­port­ing in North Korea than I cur­rently do re­port­ing at The White House.</p>
