    <p>Pa­hang’s Sul­tan Ab­dul­lah Ah­mad Shah is in­stalled as the 16th Malaysian King, six months af­ter the sur­prise ab­di­ca­tion of his pre­de­ces­sor, Sul­tan Muham­mad V of Ke­lan­tan.</p>
    <p>FEB 24, 2020</p>
    <p>Tun Dr Ma­hathir Mo­hamad re­signs as prime min­is­ter fol­low­ing the col­lapse of the Pakatan Hara­pan coali­tion af­ter his party left the pact.The King reap­points Dr Ma­hathir as in­terim leader un­til a suc­ces­sor is named.</p>
    <p>FEB 25</p>
    <p>The palace says that the King will meet all the 222 elected MPs be­fore de­cid­ing on the next step.</p>
    <p>FEB 28</p>
    <p>Af­ter meet­ing all MPs, the King is not con­fi­dent that any par­lia­men­tar­ian has ma­jor­ity sup­port to form a new gov­ern­ment, the palace says.</p>
    <p>FEB 29</p>
    <p>The King names Tan Sri Muhyid­din Yassin as the next prime min­is­ter, on the grounds that he pos­si­bly has the ma­jor­ity sup­port among law­mak­ers in Par­lia­ment.</p>

    <p>Sul­tan Ab­dul­lah wit­nesses the swear­ing in of Mr Muhyid­din as Malaysia’s eighth Prime Min­is­ter.</p>
    <p>MAY 18</p>
    <p>Sul­tan Ab­dul­lah says the ap­point­ment of Mr Muhyid­din as premier dur­ing the tur­moil this year was proper and con­sti­tu­tional, as Par­lia­ment sits for the first time since Mr Muhyid­din was ap­pointed.

    <p>OCT 23</p>
    <p>Reports emerge that Mr Muhyid­din is plan­ning to de­clare emer­gency mea­sures to fore­stall a Bud­get vote. Mr Muhyid­din meets with the King, and is be­lieved to have sought his con­sent for the plan.</p>
