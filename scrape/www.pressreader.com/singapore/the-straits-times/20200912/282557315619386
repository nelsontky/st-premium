    <p>• Af­ter a brief yet tur­bu­lent close sea­son marked by the at­tempted de­par­ture of Lionel Messi, lit­tle trans­fer ac­tiv­ity and the re­newed threat of the coronaviru­s in Spain, La Liga re­turns to­day amid a fix­ture list chaos and a de­cid­edly gloomy out­look.</p>
    <p>The league was forced to change the days of its fix­tures for the open­ing week­end, an­nounc­ing on Wed­nes­day night it had given in to the “non­sense” of the Spanish Foot­ball Fed­er­a­tion, to avoid “ir­repara­ble sport­ing dam­age to the clubs”.</p>
    <p>The sea­son’s orig­i­nal cur­tain­raiser be­tween Granada and Ath­letic Bil­bao, ini­tially sched­uled for yes­ter­day, will be played to­day. And Alaves against Real Betis on Mon­day has been brought for­ward to to­mor­row. The first game of the sea­son will in­stead be Eibar against Celta Vigo at Ipu­rua.</p>
    <p>Fans are not ex­pected to re­turn to Spanish sta­di­ums un­til next year at the ear­li­est as Covid-19 in­fec­tion rates con­tinue to rise across the coun­try, de­priv­ing La Liga of the noise and colour for which it is renowned.</p>
    <p>There is also a sub­dued feel­ing as Real Madrid, Barcelona, Atletico Madrid and Sevilla are among six teams miss­ing the first week­end hav­ing fin­ished last sea­son late, with the lat­ter three sides also miss­ing the sec­ond week­end.</p>
    <p>The fi­nan­cial im­pact of the pandemic, mean­while, is be­ing keenly felt across the league, af­flict­ing even the wealth­i­est clubs.</p>
    <p>Cham­pi­ons Real Madrid, who usu­ally spend their sum­mers parad­ing big-money sign­ings at glitzy pre­sen­ta­tion cer­e­monies, are not ex­pected to bring in any­one new. In­stead, they are re­call­ing loa­nees such as Martin Ode­gaard while clear­ing out play­ers sur­plus to re­quire­ments.</p>
    <p>Still, Zine­dine Zi­dane’s side are the favourites to lift the ti­tle af­ter last sea­son’s re­lent­less run of 10 straight vic­to­ries and the tur­moil at arch-ri­vals Barcelona.</p>
    <p>Barca may have clung on to Messi af­ter a two-week saga but are still in deep trou­ble on many a sport­ing, in­sti­tu­tional and fi­nan­cial level.</p>
    <p>Pres­i­dent Josep Maria Bar­tomeu is threat­ened by a po­ten­tial vote of no con­fi­dence, while the club are try­ing to ease a colos­sal wage bill, shown by their will­ing­ness to part with Luis Suarez, Ivan Rakitic and Ar­turo Vi­dal for cut-price deals.</p>
    <p>New coach Ronald Koe­man, a beloved former player but with a patchy record as a club man­ager, faces a daunt­ing task in re­shap­ing an age­ing side whose weak­nesses were woe­fully ex­posed by the 8-2 de­feat by Bay­ern Mu­nich in the Cham­pi­ons League.</p>
    <p>Un­like pre­de­ces­sors Ernesto Valverde and Quique Se­tien, the Dutch­man will look to im­pose his au­thor­ity on a dress­ing room that many be­lieve has had too much power for too long and it will be fas­ci­nat­ing to see how he gels with the play­ers.</p>
    <p>Hope for Barca comes in teenage for­ward Ansu Fati, who re­cently be­came Spain’s youngest goalscorer and had a highly promis­ing de­but</p>
    <p>cam­paign last time round.</p>
    <p>Atletico Madrid are used to be­ing Spain’s third force but face com­pe­ti­tion from Sevilla, who could even chal­lenge the usual sus­pects in the ti­tle race if they build on an ex­cel­lent sea­son in which they fin­ished fourth and won the Europa League.</p>
    <p>Sevilla have cru­cially kept to­gether most of their squad, hav­ing been ac­cus­tomed to part­ing with 10 or more play­ers each sum­mer.</p>
    <p>Vil­lar­real are also one to watch af­ter re­cruit­ing Unai Emery as coach</p>
    <p>and mak­ing some eye-catch­ing sign­ings in­clud­ing mid­field­ers Dani Parejo and Fran­cis Co­quelin from Valencia plus ex­cit­ing play­maker Take­fusa Kubo, on loan from Real Madrid.</p>
    <p>Valencia, owned by Sin­ga­pore bil­lion­aire Peter Lim, are braced for a test­ing sea­son af­ter part­ing with their cap­tain Parejo plus Spain for­ward Ro­drigo due to a dire fi­nan­cial sit­u­a­tion which meant they were un­able to pay their play­ers.</p>
