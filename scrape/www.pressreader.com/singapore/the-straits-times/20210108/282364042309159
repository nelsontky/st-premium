    <p>LPGA com­mis­sioner Mike Whan said on Wed­nes­day he will step down from the job later this year af­ter an 11-year reign helm­ing women’s golf.</p>
    <p>The Amer­i­can said in an open let­ter he would quit the po­si­tion some­time this year, but did not give a firm timetable for his de­par­ture.</p>
    <p>“I know that news may come as a bit of a shock, but trust me when I say it fol­lows many, many months of deep in­tro­spec­tion,” Whan, who turns 56 next month, wrote in the let­ter.</p>
    <p>He is the long­est-serv­ing com­mis­sioner in the his­tory of the LPGA, and only the eighth per­son to hold the job.</p>
    <p>He is widely cred­ited with strength­en­ing the LPGA Tour since tak­ing over, in­creas­ing the num­ber of tour­na­ments on the cir­cuit (it had 24 events when he took over in 2009) and boost­ing over­all prize money by more than US$25 mil­lion (S$33 mil­lion).</p>
    <p>De­spite a tu­mul­tuous 2020, when the coron­avirus pan­demic dec­i­mated the sched­ule, the Tour re­cently con­firmed a 34-event sea­son for 2021 with a record US$76.4 mil­lion in prize money.</p>
    <p>“I sim­ply wouldn’t leave the LPGA if I thought the fu­ture was un­cer­tain or not trend­ing straight up,” Whan wrote.</p>
    <p>“Even af­ter the chal­lenges we faced in 2020, the LPGA has never been more fi­nan­cially se­cure, deeper in leadership tal­ent, or more an­chored by pas­sion­ate, di­verse spon­sors from all around the world.</p>
    <p>“The LPGA is poised for even greater heights, and as such, I’m ex­cited to hand the ba­ton to the next leader and be­come their big­gest sup­porter.”</p>
    <p>His de­ci­sion was l amented many play­ers. Hall of Famer Juli Inkster said: “Mike ran the Tour like a busi­ness, but he also ran it with com­pas­sion. I think the LPGA was very close to fold­ing, and he brought it back to life and now it’s thriv­ing.”</p>
    <p>Vicki Goetze-Ack­er­man, the LPGA Tour’s player pres­i­dent, said Whan had been the “right leader at the right time”.</p>
    <p>“He re­built the Tour and then reimag­ined its fu­ture by bring­ing new events, new spon­sors and a new value propo­si­tion around di­ver­sity and in­clu­sion to t he LPGA,” she added.</p>
