    <p>Re­cently, my daugh­ter re­quired a wis­dom tooth ex­trac­tion with surgery. We con­sulted a neigh­bour­hood den­tist and were given a quo­ta­tion of $950 for the pro­ce­dure. We were told we would be al­lowed to use Medis­ave.</p>
    <p>My daugh­ter called another den­tist and was quoted $1,000, with the use of Medis­ave also al­lowed. I checked with a third den­tal clinic in Ang Mo Kio cen­tral, and was quoted a $500 flat fee, cash only.</p>
    <p>What is the ra­tio­nale for such a big dif­fer­ence in charges? And it ap­pears only the higher quotes al­low for the use of Medis­ave.</p>
    <p>Such sky­rock­et­ing charges are not only re­stricted to wis­dom tooth ex­trac­tion, but also can be found for crown­ing and im­plants.</p>
    <p>The quotes for treat­ments where Medis­ave can be used are eas­ily two or three times higher.</p>
    <p>A few years back, I brought my el­derly mother to a den­tist to fix new den­tures.</p>
    <p>The den­tist said the clinic did not of­fer den­ture ser­vices but of­fered to give her a rou­tine clean­ing to her four front teeth in her lower jaw. She was charged over $300, but had to shell out only about $20 to $30 in cash.</p>
    <p>I can’t help but feel that there is some loop­hole when it comes to these charg­ing prac­tices which is be­ing ex­ploited, tar­get­ing peo­ple’s hard-earned Medis­ave funds, as well as other gov­ern­ment sub­si­dies.</p>
    <p>This should not hap­pen.</p>
