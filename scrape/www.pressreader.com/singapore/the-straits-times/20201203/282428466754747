    <p>LON­DON • Uefa is to hold talks over pro­pos­als that would see the Cham­pi­ons League group stage trans­formed to guar­an­tee 10 matches for each side in the com­pe­ti­tion, it was re­ported on Tues­day.</p>
    <p>Cham­pi­ons League re­form is ex­pected from 2024 on­wards as Euro­pean foot­ball’s gov­ern­ing body aims to ward off the threat of a break­away su­per league from the con­ti­nent’s big­gest clubs.</p>
    <p>Bri­tish news­pa­per The Times re­ported that a “Swiss sys­tem” that would see all sides in the com­pe­ti­tion com­pete in one league and play 10 op­po­nents, se­lected by a draw, is now Uefa’s favoured model for re­form.</p>
    <p>The sys­tem is de­signed to have fewer mean­ing­less group matches and more games be­tween the con­ti­nent’s big­gest clubs.</p>
    <p>Af­ter the 10 games, the top 16 clubs i n t he stand­ings would progress to the knock­out rounds. The team that fin­ished top of the league stand­ings would play the club in 16th, sec­ond would play 15th and so on in a sys­tem sim­i­lar to that used by the Na­tional Bas­ket­ball As­so­ci­a­tion play-offs.</p>
    <p>The teams fin­ish­ing 17th to 24th would drop i nto the Europa League knock­out rounds.</p>
    <p>Cur­rently, the 32-team group stage is di­vided into eight groups of four with the top two in each sec­tion pro­gress­ing to the last 16 and third-place drop­ping into the Europa League. Pre­vi­ous pro­pos­als for four groups of eight teams to guar­an­tee 14 matches for each club were re­jected.</p>
    <p>Lars-Chris­ter Ols­son, chair­man of the Euro­pean Leagues as­so­ci­a­tion which cov­ers 29 na­tions, said the new pro­pos­als had a “more re­al­is­tic” chance of find­ing con­sen­sus.</p>
    <p>“The new pro­pos­als are much more re­al­is­tic than the one in 2019 but what is im­por­tant is pro­tect­ing the ac­cess list to all the Euro­pean com­pe­ti­tions and en­sur­ing the gap in fi­nan­cial dis­tri­bu­tion is not widened be­tween the Cham­pi­ons League, Europa League and Europa Con­fer­ence League,” he told The Times.</p>
    <p>How­ever, the ad­di­tion of four Cham­pi­ons League matches a sea­son will cause fur­ther con­cerns over player wel­fare in a con­gested cal­en­dar.</p>
