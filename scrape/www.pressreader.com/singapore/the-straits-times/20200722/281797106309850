    <p>SYD­NEY • South-east Asian low-cost car­ri­ers, a key growth en­gine for plane­mak­ers and leas­ing com­pa­nies for a decade be­fore the coro­n­avirus pan­demic, are fal­ter­ing fi­nan­cially as de­mand plunges, raising ques­tions over whether they can re­place and double their fleets.</p>
    <p>Au­di­tors for Malaysia’s AirAsia Group and Viet­nam’s Vi­etJet Avi­a­tion are con­cerned about cash flows and fund­ing, while In­done­sia’s Lion Air has put the brakes on a planned flota­tion.</p>
    <p>Even be­fore the pan­demic, bankers and leas­ing bosses were wor­ried about whether air­craft or­dered dur­ing a decade-long buy­ing frenzy by South-east Asian car­ri­ers would be de­liv­ered.</p>
    <p>The car­ri­ers, which have off­shoots in var­i­ous coun­tries, have 938 planes on or­der and lease most of their fleets of 476 planes, ac­cord­ing to Avi­a­tion Week data.</p>
    <p>To be sure, bud­get air­lines with large do­mes­tic op­er­a­tions are well placed for a post-pan­demic re­cov­ery, de­spite hav­ing less fi­nan­cial sup­port than their state-owned ri­vals.</p>
    <p>Their lower cost struc­ture helps re­duce the rate at which they burn cash and gives them the flex­i­bil­ity to ben­e­fit first from any re­cov­ery, an­a­lysts say.</p>
    <p>But with borders shut and eco­nomic growth stunted, a re­turn to the low-cost in­ter­na­tional travel needed for them to af­ford all of the planes they have on or­der looks in­creas­ingly doubt­ful – a wor­ry­ing sign for the com­pa­nies that make and lease air­craft.</p>
    <p>“One area that I’m con­cerned about gen­er­ally is just those low-cost car­ri­ers which or­dered too many air­craft,” Mr Robert Martin, chief ex­ec­u­tive of Singapore-based lessor BOC Avi­a­tion, told Reuters.</p>
    <p>“I think there will still be work to be done on those dur­ing the third quar­ter,” he said, re­fer­ring to ne­go­ti­a­tions over cur­rent lease con­tracts.</p>
    <p>BOOM TIMES</p>
    <p>Un­til now, a fast-ex­pand­ing mid­dle class with dis­pos­able in­come and greater lib­er­al­i­sa­tion have made the re­gion lu­cra­tive for plane­mak­ers and their sup­pli­ers.</p>
    <p>At the Singapore Air­show in Fe­bru­ary – be­fore the pan­demic spread broadly out­side China – Boe­ing pre­dicted that South-east Asian air­lines would need 4,500 planes over the next 20 years, with Viet­nam top­ping the traf­fic growth charts.</p>
    <p>With that came pre­dic­tions of jobs for 182,000 new com­mer­cial pi­lots, cabin crew or tech­ni­cians.</p>
    <p>Now em­ploy­ees are be­ing laid off and fur­loughed and dozens of air­craft are un­de­liv­ered, ex­cept for air­lines still us­ing fi­nanc­ing ar­ranged be­fore the cri­sis, with man­u­fac­tur­ers and leas­ing com­pa­nies ab­sorb­ing losses.</p>
    <p>Con­sul­tancy IBA es­ti­mates there will be an over­sup­ply of up to 2,500 planes glob­ally over the next 20 months.</p>
    <p>Les­sors are of­fer­ing pay­ment de­fer­rals to cus­tomers with grounded planes, but a pos­si­ble cash crunch looms when the pay­ment hol­i­day ends, said Singapore-based avi­a­tion an­a­lyst Bren­dan So­bie.</p>
    <p>“Even with a do­mes­tic re­cov­ery, you don’t have in­ter­na­tional,” Mr So­bie said. “They are car­ry­ing too large a fleet and can’t fully utilise the fleet be­cause you can’t op­er­ate it back-of-clock on in­ter­na­tional flights at night.”</p>
    <p>That threat­ens the de­liv­ery pipe­line, though Vi­etJet last month told share­hold­ers it plans to add 12 Air­bus jets to its fleet this year.</p>
    <p>Be­fore the cri­sis, Vi­etJet had or­dered planes from both Air­bus and Boe­ing, in part to launch sub­sidiaries in mul­ti­ple coun­tries.</p>
    <p>But so far, it has set up only one off­shoot, in Thai­land, where it com­petes against the sub­sidiaries of AirAsia and Lion Air.</p>
    <p>AirAsia, which has said it is look­ing for ad­di­tional debt and eq­uity fi­nanc­ing, ex­pects to reach around 70 per cent to 75 per cent of nor­mal ca­pac­ity by year end.</p>
    <p>But the group has told Air­bus it does not ex­pect to take any new planes this year, prompt­ing Air­bus to put at least six un­de­liv­ered air­craft up for sale.</p>
    <p>“Air­bus is work­ing closely with all its cus­tomers at this most chal­leng­ing time,” a spokesman said. AirAsia de­clined to com­ment.</p>
    <p>In In­done­sia, Lion Air had al­ready threat­ened to can­cel its or­der for Boe­ing 737 MAX jets af­ter a 2018 crash.</p>
    <p>Bankers have said the group has slashed spend­ing due to the cri­sis. Lion Air de­clined to com­ment on its or­der plans.</p>
    <p>Boe­ing said that al­though pas­sen­ger traf­fic might take a few years to re­cover, it was con­fi­dent in the long-term de­mand in South-east Asia.</p>
