    <p>Two big pow­ers can­not live with each other – that is the Thucy­dides trap. In the present era, these pow­ers are the United States and China.</p>
    <p>China-US re­la­tions are cur­rently the most im­por­tant is­sue, as global order can only be es­tab­lished through an or­derly and pro­duc­tive re­la­tion­ship be­tween China and the US. Nei­ther coun­try will be able to realise its true full po­ten­tial if op­po­si­tion by the other im­pedes progress.</p>
    <p>At present, the dy­nam­ics are un­for­tu­nately coun­ter­pro­duc­tive. All the pil­lars sup­port­ing sound China-US re­la­tions – se­cu­rity, eco­nomic de­vel­op­ment and cul­ture – are be­ing wrecked by both sides. It is mount­ing se­cu­rity con­cerns on every other di­men­sion of the US-China re­la­tion­ship. Eco­nomic and cul­tural gains can­not fully com­pen­sate for per­ceived se­cu­rity losses.</p>
    <p>Re­cent pub­lic opin­ion sur­veys in­di­cate that cit­i­zens in the US and China in­creas­ingly view the other as a “threat”. The Amer­i­can pub­lic’s “un­favourable” ratings of China in 2019 ex­ceeded even the very high un­favourable ratings in 1989, the year of the Tianan­men Square vi­o­lence. More­over, there is now an un­mis­tak­able trend in both the US and China to­wards as­sum­ing that civil so­ci­ety and ed­u­ca­tional or­gan­i­sa­tions work­ing on each another’s soil are in­stru­ments of sub­ver­sion rather than of mu­tual un­der­stand­ing and shared ben­e­fit.</p>
    <p>The US for al­most two decades has un­der­mined its own great­est soft power, which in­cludes or­derly gov­er­nance at home and gen­er­ally re­spon­si­ble be­hav­iour abroad. A series of is­sues have eroded its cred­i­bil­ity: the Iraq War, do­mes­tic eco­nomic mis­man­age­ment, the global fi­nan­cial cri­sis and the with­drawal from in­ter­na­tional agree­ments that Wash­ing­ton had en­cour­aged and signed.</p>
    <p>“Amer­ica First”, as pro­moted by US Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump, is a doc­trine with no at­trac­tion to any­one but a frac­tion of the Amer­i­can pub­lic. The eco­nomic in­ter­de­pen­dence be­tween the US and China has been hurt by Mr Trump.</p>
    <p>On China’s side, former leader Deng Xiaop­ing’s ad­vice was: “Don’t show off” and that China should ac­cept that in many cases, China is still be­hind. If you re­main prag­matic, you know when to stop and when to push ahead. Look­ing at China’s poli­cies of late, some of which have been as­sertive to­wards neigh­bour­ing coun­tries, it seems that this ad­vice needs to be re­vived.</p>
    <p>At this stage, China has to im­prove her poli­cies of open­ing the econ­omy for trade, which she has promised to the world. China has also pledged to re­spect in­tel­lec­tual prop­erty rights. How China is go­ing to or­gan­ise her eco­nomic de­vel­op­ment is her own prob­lem, in­clud­ing how she will plan and or­gan­ise her ob­jec­tives with tech­no­log­i­cal de­vel­op­ment, and when to achieve it. There are lim­its to what the world could ask from China.</p>
    <p>The US strat­egy in Asia has been to pre­vent one sin­gle big power or a coali­tion from con­trol­ling the Eurasian land­mass and the Pa­cific. The US speaks in­creas­ingly of the need to co­op­er­ate with “like-minded coun­tries”, but it seems that this does not in­clude China. China sees hege­mony and con­tain­ment as the ul­ti­mate aims of US poli­cies.</p>
    <p>The US cur­rently faces China and Rus­sia, which are con­duct­ing joint mil­i­tary ex­er­cises as a de­ter­rence against the US. The align­ment of Bei­jing and Moscow is grow­ing closer as Wash­ing­ton seeks to con­struct a counter-align­ment with its Indo-Pa­cific strat­egy, thereby mov­ing the re­la­tion­ship from the realm of mu­tual strate­gic sus­pi­cion to­wards strate­gic fric­tion and mu­tual de­ter­rence. Thus, sig­nals of de­clin­ing co­op­er­a­tion be­tween the US and China are ev­ery­where. The cur­rent trade fric­tions be­tween the two are in­flict­ing pain on the global econ­omy, as well as on their own cit­i­zens.</p>
    <p>Tai­wan and Hong Kong are, of course, big is­sues in the re­la­tions. The unan­i­mous pas­sage of the Tai­wan Travel Act (2018) was signed by Pres­i­dent Trump with­out mak­ing any state­ment ex­press­ing the in­ten­tion to im­ple­ment the Act con­sis­tent with the Three Com­mu­niques and the Tai­wan Re­la­tions Act, which have been the doc­u­ments pro­vid­ing the frame­work for China-US re­la­tions for 40 years.</p>
    <p>We still need to find out the true eco­nomic im­pact of the Covid-19 pan­demic and how deep a re­ces­sion would be in the US. A deep re­ces­sion would make it very dif­fi­cult for Mr Trump in the next elec­tion. If he is re-elected, it could be a calamity. The US could never re­cover her former lead­er­ship of the world.</p>
    <p>A new “ra­tio­nal” pres­i­dent, such as former vice-pres­i­dent and Demo­cratic pres­i­den­tial nom­i­nee Joe Bi­den, would be ra­tio­nal and sen­si­ble to China. But ei­ther way, US policy to­wards China re­mains strict. The US will con­tinue to think that China is not al­ways hon­est in im­ple­ment­ing her obli­ga­tions and prom­ises.</p>
    <p>If after a new leader is elected, the US and China could have some mu­tual basic un­der­stand­ing and lay down some basic agree­ments on how two big pow­ers should go about run­ning the in­ter­na­tional order, then peace, sta­bil­ity and de­vel­op­ment in the world could be main­tained. The world can­not ac­cept a hege­mon any­more in the fu­ture. In­ter­na­tional re­la­tions should be mul­ti­lat­eral, where China and the US could be the primus in­ter pares.</p>
    <p>Now, the US and China must de­cide whether they will pur­sue pri­macy and dom­i­nance or seek re­gional bal­ance by mak­ing room for one another. The lat­ter ap­proach seems fea­si­ble and ad­vis­able; the former does not. Both sides have to an­swer the ques­tion each put to the other: “Will the US make room for China in­ter­na­tion­ally?” and “Will China al­low for US in­flu­ence in the re­gion, es­pe­cially in the Asia-Pa­cific?”</p>
