    <p>When I was a sleep-de­prived mum of tod­dlers, I en­vied mums of older kids, of­ten ask­ing them when it would be my turn.</p>
    <p>In the haze of feed­ing, clean­ing and deal­ing with melt­downs, I brushed aside their warn­ings that the teenage years would still be chal­leng­ing, but in a dif­fer­ent way.</p>
    <p>Fast for­ward sev­eral years, we now have a teenager, a tween and a tod­dler at home, and I see the irony of my words.</p>
    <p>Yes, a tod­dler may have tantrums, but a teenager is prone to mood swings and out­bursts too.</p>
    <p>When the sin­gle-minded four-year-old wants a snack I do not want to give her, there can be end­less whin­ing; with the 11- and 14-year-olds, the stakes are higher and their per­sis­tence no less dogged.</p>
    <p>There have been in­fu­ri­at­ing mo­ments when I stopped to won­der if this is what I gave up my job six years ago for.</p>
    <p>Still, as I nav­i­gate this com­plex maze known as par­ent­ing teenagers, I have stum­bled upon guid­ing posts that have helped to pre­serve my san­ity and, more im­por­tantly, our re­la­tion­ship.</p>
    <p>Even be­fore my el­dest be­came a teenager, we had run-ins over var­i­ous things, from small is­sues like chang­ing out of a tatty T-shirt be­fore step­ping out of the home, to oth­ers like screen games or be­ing care­less with his words.</p>
    <p>When I de­spaired over the is­sues we clashed about, a line I heard in a pod­cast on par­ent­ing teenagers res­onated with me – “pre­serve the re­la­tion­ship above all else”.</p>
    <p>It was a re­minder that in my quest to mould my strong-willed child into “a good boy”, I had for­got­ten to have fun with him.</p>
    <p>I was fo­cus­ing on the child’s be­hav­iour rather than the child.</p>
    <p>Keep­ing this at the back of my mind while rais­ing the teen and tween has helped me think ahead, whether my daily de­ci­sions and ac­tions would make or break our re­la­tion­ship in the long run.</p>
    <p>Ul­ti­mately, hav­ing kids who lis­ten to me be­cause of our bond is more im­por­tant to me than hav­ing chil­dren who toe the line be­cause of my wrath and end up com­pli­ant on the out­side, but de­fi­ant on the in­side.</p>
    <p>Read­ing up on ado­les­cents’ be­hav­iour and their quirks has changed the way I frame their ac­tions and how I re­act to them.</p>
    <p>So, I now adopt a col­lab­o­ra­tive rather than an ad­ver­sar­ial stance and that has helped us work through the dif­fer­ences we have.</p>
    <p>Main­tain­ing the re­la­tion­ship above all else doesn’t mean giv­ing in to them or let­ting them do as they please.</p>
    <p>My hus­band and I try to com­mu­ni­cate clear ex­pec­ta­tions, be it about their be­hav­iour, screen time, school work or chores.</p>
    <p>It also helps to share fre­quently with them. It has be­come al­most sec­ond na­ture to talk about their day since they were in pre-school.</p>
    <p>This may not hap­pen im­me­di­ately after school, es­pe­cially for the teenager. I some­times hear sto­ries weeks after they have hap­pened, when he is in a mood to chat.</p>
    <p>While I might have prod­ded him about this or that in the past,</p>
    <p>I’ve come to re­alise that not only is it un­pro­duc­tive, but he also sees my con­cern as nag­ging. So, I’ve learnt to hold my tongue.</p>
    <p>This means I have to pick my bat­tles and trust him to make the right de­ci­sion. And if he doesn’t, then trust that he will learn from the ex­pe­ri­ence.</p>
    <p>So, I may point out the pros and cons, but ul­ti­mately, leave the de­ci­sion to him.</p>
    <p>I con­stantly look for ways to bond with the teen and the tween, es­pe­cially after dif­fi­cult days. It is eas­ier to find com­mon in­ter­ests with my daugh­ter, like bak­ing, do­ing craft or go­ing to the li­brary.</p>
    <p>With the boy, screen games are not my thing. We don’t share the same tastes in mu­sic; he loves foot­ball and rugby, while I pre­fer long walks. But we find other ways, for in­stance, hav­ing a nice meal to cel­e­brate the end of ex­am­i­na­tions, just the two of us.</p>
    <p>I also try to be open with him, telling him what I feel about his ac­tions or why I make cer­tain de­ci­sions. When I told him that I would be writ­ing about him, he replied with a mock threat:</p>
    <p>“Just re­mem­ber I will be read­ing your ar­ti­cle.”</p>
    <p>These days, I find my­self in­creas­ingly ap­pre­ci­at­ing hav­ing a teenager at home.</p>
    <p>I en­joy his oc­ca­sional ir­rev­er­ent wit or hear­ing his point of view.</p>
    <p>I’m grate­ful that he helps me with heavy gro­ceries and still holds my hand when we go out. I love how he takes care of his sis­ters, bring­ing out his old Trans­form­ers fig­urines to keep the youngest en­ter­tained or help­ing the other with math­e­mat­ics, even if he an­noys them – in­ten­tion­ally.</p>
    <p>While there are frus­trat­ing mo­ments and the teenage jour­ney is far from over, we have come a long way.</p>
    <p>It helps that we have reached a com­pro­mise on some is­sues.</p>
    <p>When he in­sists on watch­ing those mid­dle-of-the-night foot­ball matches and he knows I pre­fer him to get enough sleep, he makes it a point to go to bed ear­lier and set an alarm for the match.</p>
    <p>And on my part, I have given up on the tus­sle over tatty T-shirts. Mostly.</p>
