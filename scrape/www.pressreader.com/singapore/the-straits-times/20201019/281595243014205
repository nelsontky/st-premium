    <p>Tens of thou­sands of antigov­ern­ment pro­test­ers took over key in­ter­sec­tions in Bangkok, de­fy­ing a ban on protests for a fourth day with chants of “down with dic­ta­tor­ship” and “re­form the monar­chy”. Thai Lawyers for Hu­man Rights said at least 80 pro­test­ers have been ar­rested since last Tues­day.</p>
    <p>Tens of thou­sands of anti-gov­ern­ment pro­test­ers took over key in­ter­sec­tions in Bangkok yes­ter­day, de­fy­ing a ban on protests for the fourth day with chants of “down with dic­ta­tor­ship” and “re­form the monar­chy”.</p>
    <p>Demon­stra­tions have per­sisted de­spite the ar­rest of dozens of pro­test­ers and their lead­ers, the use of wa­ter can­non and the shut­down of much of Bangkok’s metro rail sys­tem, in an ef­fort to quell over three months of street ac­tion.</p>
    <p>Thai Lawyers for Hu­man Rights said at least 80 pro­test­ers have been ar­rested since last Tues­day, with 27 still be­ing held.</p>
    <p>“Free our friends!” the pro­test­ers called out as they stood in the rain in a mass of colour­ful pon­chos and um­brel­las.</p>
    <p>Some held up pic­tures of de­tained protest lead­ers.</p>
    <p>“I can­not let the stu­dents fight alone,” said 24-year-old Phat, a first-time ral­ly­goer at Bangkok’s Vic­tory Mon­u­ment.</p>
    <p>Prime Min­is­ter Prayut Chan-ocha is con­cerned about the spread­ing protests and the gov­ern­ment wants to talk, his spokesman said.</p>
    <p>Across Thai­land yes­ter­day, demon­stra­tions were held in sol­i­dar­ity in at least 19 other prov­inces, in­clud­ing Non­thaburi, Chon­buri and Khon Kaen.</p>
    <p>Na­tional Po­lice spokesman Yingyos Thep­jum­nong warned pro­test­ers ear­lier yes­ter­day that no ral­lies “caus­ing un­rest and dis­or­der” would be al­lowed.</p>
    <p>But po­lice kept a low-key pres­ence yes­ter­day as more t han 20,000 peo­ple, ac­cord­ing to lo­cal me­dia, de­scended on the Vic­tory Mon­u­ment.</p>
    <p>“We are com­mit­ted to main­tain­ing peace and or­der. In or­der to do so, we are bound by laws, in­ter­na­tional stan­dards, hu­man rights,” po­lice spokesman Kis­sana Phathanach­aroen told a news con­fer­ence.</p>
    <p>Pro­test­ers say Mr Prayut en­gi­neered last year’s elec­tion to keep the power he seized in a 2014 coup – an ac­cu­sa­tion he de­nies.</p>
    <p>The demon­stra­tions have also be­come more openly crit­i­cal of the monar­chy, with pro­test­ers de­mand­ing curbs to its pow­ers de­spite po­ten­tial jail terms of up to 15 years for any­one in­sult­ing the King.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing demon­stra­tions by tens of thou­sands of peo­ple at mul­ti­ple points across Bangkok on Satur­day, pro­test­ers painted a flag on the road with “Repub­lic of Thai­land” writ­ten across it. Overnight, the writ­ing was painted over.</p>
    <p>The Royal Palace has made no com­ment, but King Maha Va­ji­ra­longkorn has said Thai­land needs peo­ple who love the coun­try and the monar­chy.</p>
    <p>Sol­i­dar­ity protests were also be­ing held or planned in Tai­wan, Denmark, Swe­den, France, the United States and Canada.</p>
    <p>The Thai pro­test­ers, who have adopted the fast-mov­ing tac­tics of Hong Kong ac­tivists, kept the po­lice guess­ing about where demon­stra­tions would be held with a slew of so­cial me­dia posts.</p>
    <p>Links have grown be­tween pro­test­ers in Thai­land and Hong Kong with a so-called Milk Tea Al­liance, re­fer­ring to drinks pop­u­lar in both places.</p>
