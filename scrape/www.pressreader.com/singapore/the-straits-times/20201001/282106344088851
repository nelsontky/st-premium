    <p>A woman flew into a rage when she no­ticed that her do­mes­tic helper had ar­ranged some clothes “wrongly” in a walk-in closet and as­saulted the Filip­ina.</p>
    <p>Wee Yee Nee gath­ered some of the clothes, with their hang­ers still at­tached, and flung them at Ms Felisilda Sheila Marie Juromo, 37.</p>
    <p>The hang­ers had clips with rela­tively sharp edges on the side and one of them cut the maid’s face when it struck her.</p>
    <p>The Sin­ga­porean, 41, was yes­ter­day sen­tenced to a week in jail af­ter she pleaded guilty to an assault charge.</p>
    <p>She was also or­dered to pay the maid $1,000 as com­pen­sa­tion.</p>
    <p>Two other charges in­volv­ing Ms Juromo – a sec­ond assault charge and one count of ha­rass­ment – were con­sid­ered dur­ing sen­tenc­ing.</p>
    <p>The court heard that Ms Juromo started work­ing at Wee’s flat in Cam­bridge Road, near Lit­tle In­dia, on Jan 23 last year.</p>
    <p>The re­la­tion­ship be­tween the two women grad­u­ally be­came worse, the court heard.</p>
    <p>Deputy Pub­lic Pros­e­cu­tor Norine Tan said: “The ac­cused be­came more eas­ily ag­i­tated and an­gry at the vic­tim and would scold her.</p>
    <p>“Ac­cord­ing to the ac­cused, this was, at times, be­cause the vic­tim lied.”</p>
    <p>Wee was in her walk-in closet on March 30 last year when she re­alised that Ms Juromo had “wrongly” placed four items of cloth­ing on each hanger.</p>
    <p>The DPP added: “She scolded the vic­tim, who was stand­ing at the en­trance of the walk-in wardrobe, and threw a bunch of clothes with the hang­ers at­tached at the vic­tim... One of the hang­ers hit the vic­tim’s face, caus­ing her to sus­tain a cut and bleed­ing above her right eye­brow.”</p>
    <p>The area around the wound be­came swollen. Wee then placed some ice and ap­plied an­ti­sep­tic cream on the af­fected area.</p>
    <p>The court heard that Ms Juromo lodged a po­lice re­port on April 12 last year.</p>
    <p>DPP Tan said that as a re­sult of the abuse, the maid stopped work­ing for Wee and found an­other em­ployer about two months later.</p>
    <p>Wee’s bail was set at $5,000 yes­ter­day and she will sur­ren­der her­self at the State Courts next Mon­day to be­gin serv­ing her jail term.</p>
    <p>For as­sault­ing the maid, she could have been jailed for up to three years and fined up to $7,500.</p>
