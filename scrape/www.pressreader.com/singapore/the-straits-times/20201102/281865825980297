    <p>HONG KONG • Seven Hong Kong pro-democ­racy politi­cians were ar­rested yes­ter­day over a protest and scuf­fles that broke out in the leg­is­la­ture ear­lier this year, the lat­est pros­e­cu­tions tar­get­ing Beijing’s op­po­nents in the deeply di­vided city.</p>
    <p>The seven politi­cians – four of them sit­ting law­mak­ers – were ar­rested on charges of con­tempt and “in­ter­fer­ing” with mem­bers of the city’s Leg­isla­tive Coun­cil in early May, po­lice said.</p>
    <p>The Cham­ber passes semi-au­ton­o­mous Hong Kong’s laws, but only half of its seats are di­rectly elected.</p>
    <p>Scuf­fles and protests rou­tinely break out, with the pro-democ­racy mi­nor­ity of­ten re­sort­ing to fil­i­bus­ter­ing, chant­ing and ob­struc­tion to try to halt Bills they op­pose.</p>
    <p>On May 8, con­fronta­tions broke out in a com­mit­tee that de­cides which Bills come up for de­bate.</p>
    <p>The op­po­si­tion had used months of fil­i­bus­ter­ing to stop the ap­point­ment of the com­mit­tee’s leader. The pro-Beijing camp re­sponded by forcibly in­stalling one of their politi­cians to the com­mit­tee chair.</p>
    <p>That prompted an­gry scenes and a protest in the Cham­ber, with law­mak­ers from both sides dis­play­ing plac­ards amid bois­ter­ous heck­ling and phys­i­cal ob­struc­tion. Some of the politi­cians were even­tu­ally dragged out from the Cham­ber and the in­stal­la­tion went ahead.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day’s po­lice ac­tion sin­gled out the pro-democ­racy politi­cians.</p>
    <p>“Some law­mak­ers dashed towards the se­cu­rity guards sur­round­ing the ros­trum and made it im­pos­si­ble for the meet­ing to go on,” Chief In­spec­tor Chan Wing-yu said. Asked why only pro-democ­racy politi­cians faced pros­e­cu­tion for their ac­tions that day, he de­clined to com­ment.</p>
    <p>The in­abil­ity of Hong Kongers to elect their lead­ers and law­mak­ers has been at the heart of swelling op­po­si­tion to Beijing’s rule.</p>
    <p>The ar­rested politi­cians could face up to a year in jail if con­victed.</p>
