    <p>Tai­wanese pop diva Jolin Tsai (right) is known for her sexy and flam­boy­ant per­for­mances, but she may have met her match.</p>
    <p>Her good friend, TV host Dee Hsu (left), 42, shared the lime­light with her as a guest per­former on the fi­nal day of Tsai’s con­cert tour in Kaoh­si­ung, Taiwan, on Sun­day.</p>
    <p>The duo, who were both clad in sexy out­fits, be­came the talk of the town af­ter seal­ing their per­for­mance of Tsai’s hit song Mr Q with a pas­sion­ate kiss.</p>
    <p>Hsu kissed Tsai on the lips for about two sec­onds at the end of the song.</p>
    <p>Tsai, 40, who smiled shyly at the au­di­ence later, joked that Hsu told her that she had not kissed for a long time, be­fore adding that it was the same for her.</p>
    <p>Hsu, also known as Lit­tle S, is best known for host­ing pop­u­lar talk show Mr Con &</p>
    <p>Ms Csi (2004 to 2016) with Kevin Tsai. She is mar­ried to busi­ness­man Mike Hsu and they have three daugh­ters. Jolin Tsai is sin­gle.</p>
    <p>Tsai and Hsu per­formed two more songs later, with Hsu on stage for a to­tal of 22 min­utes.</p>
    <p>Hsu later posted on so­cial me­dia pho­tos of Tsai’s con­cert, say­ing that she had been eat­ing mainly veg­eta­bles and tofu in prepa­ra­tion for Tsai’s con­cert.</p>
    <p>She also posted a photo of her knees, which be­came bruised while she was re­hears­ing for the con­cert, say­ing she did it all for her friend.</p>
    <p>Tsai’s Kaoh­si­ung leg of the Ugly Beauty World Tour kicked off on Nov 20 af­ter a hia­tus of more than 10 months due to the coro­n­avirus pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Other guest celebri­ties for the con­cert tour in­clude Hebe Tien from girl group S.H.E. and rocker Wu Bai.</p>
    <p>Tsai has not said when and where the next leg of her lat­est con­cert tour would be.</p>
