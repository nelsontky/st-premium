    <p>The plan by the In­done­sian gov­ern­ment to re­open schools in low-risk Covid-19 zones has run into op­po­si­tion from teach­ers, pae­di­a­tri­cians and child rights ad­vo­cates who say it could en­dan­ger chil­dren and lead to new in­fec­tions.</p>
    <p>More than half of In­done­sian stu­dents live in high-risk and mod­er­ate-risk Covid-19 zones, while some 40 per cent in­habit re­gions with no cases and low-risk zones, dubbed “yel­low zones” marked by few in­fec­tions. Last month, the gov­ern­ment per­mit­ted schools in re­gions with no Covid-19 cases to re­open.</p>
    <p>In­done­sian Pae­di­atric So­ci­ety chair­man Aman Bhakti Pu­lun­gan said that any de­ci­sion on re­open­ing schools should be backed by a more com­plex as­sess­ment, in­stead of based on the map­ping of riskbased zones, which he de­scribed as “dy­namic” from day to day and might not re­flect the re­al­i­ties on the ground due to un­der-test­ing.</p>
    <p>“We’ve de­manded that (Covid-19) tests must be in­creased thir­ty­fold and in­clude chil­dren,” he told The Straits Times on Mon­day.</p>
    <p>Dr Aman, who is also pres­i­dent of the Asia-Pa­cific Pae­di­atric As­so­ci­a­tion, pre­dicted that the con­se­quences of re­open­ing schools with­out proper sup­port – such as ad­e­quate sup­ply of per­sonal pro­tec­tive equip­ment, and avail­abil­ity of pae­di­a­tri­cians and in­ten­sive care units in hos­pi­tals – to tackle a po­ten­tial surge in cases could be “quite mas­sive”.</p>
    <p>“We can­not re­open schools with­out care­ful con­sid­er­a­tion,” he said.</p>
    <p>The world’s fourth-most-pop­u­lous na­tion with nearly 270 mil­lion peo­ple has re­ported 128,776 Covid-19 cases and 5,824 deaths as of yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Lat­est fig­ures from the Fed­er­a­tion of In­done­sian Teacher Unions (FSGI) show that at least 187 stu­dents and teach­ers, in­clud­ing those in Is­lamic board­ing schools, i n seven prov­inces on Java, Su­ma­tra and Kal­i­man­tan is­lands, have con­tracted the virus and one teacher has died.</p>
    <p>The FSGI has dis­missed the gov­ern­ment’s rea­son­ing for re­open­ing schools, say­ing that in­ef­fec­tive dis­tance learn­ing should not serve as the main rea­son for the move.</p>
    <p>FSGI deputy sec­re­tary-gen­eral Sa­tri­wan Salim said: “The risks (posed by the virus) on the lives and health of chil­dren, teach­ers and par­ents are much big­ger than the lag and non-op­ti­mal ed­u­ca­tional ser­vices for stu­dents.”</p>
    <p>Ed­u­ca­tion and Cul­ture Min­is­ter Nadiem Makarim an­nounced last Fri­day that the de­ci­sion was made be­cause of the prob­lems faced by teach­ers as well as par­ents with dis­tance learn­ing since March. He said teach­ers, for in­stance, had largely fo­cused on ful­fill­ing tar­geted course com­po­nents of the cur­ricu­lum, while par­ents had to jug­gle work­ing and su­per­vis­ing their chil­dren’s stud­ies at home.</p>
    <p>But Mr Sa­tri­wan, a teacher in Jakarta, and Mr Jasra Pu­tra, a com­mis­sioner of the In­done­sian Child</p>
    <p>Pro­tec­tion Com­mis­sion, be­lieve the gov­ern­ment should in­stead ad­dress the on­go­ing prob­lems with dis­tance learn­ing.</p>
    <p>Mr Jasra said: “Amid the pan­demic, the threat of death and get­ting in­fected ex­ists. Face-to-face learn­ing in­creases the risks.”</p>
    <p>He cited the case of a teacher in Paria­man city, West Su­ma­tra, who tested pos­i­tive for Covid-19 soon af­ter his school, which pre­vi­ously had zero cases, re­opened re­cently.</p>
    <p>“We hope there won’t be ad­di­tional cases in the school clus­ter with chil­dren be­com­ing the vic­tims,” he said.</p>
    <p>“Nearly 50 per cent of the cases in­volv­ing chil­dren showed that they had been in­fected by their par­ents and fam­ily, and then spread the disease to their school friends. We should not un­der­es­ti­mate it.</p>
    <p>“Chil­dren are vul­ner­a­ble and must get spe­cial pro­tec­tion dur­ing a dis­as­ter. All must ob­serve the sit­u­a­tion care­fully.”</p>
