    <p>There have been much talk about Si­bor and Sora lately. Here is how they mat­ter to you.</p>
    <p>SI­BOR</p>
    <p>The Sin­ga­pore In­ter­bank Of­fered Rate (Si­bor) is based on the in­ter­est rates re­ported by mem­ber banks in Sin­ga­pore when lend­ing un­se­cured funds de­nom­i­nated in Sin­ga­pore dol­lars. It is a daily aver­age rate that is ad­min­is­tered by the ABS Bench­marks Ad­min­is­tra­tion Co (ABS Co) since July 2015. Cur­rently, 20 mem­ber banks con­trib­ute to the cal­cu­la­tion of Si­bor.</p>
    <p>They are the three lo­cal banks (DBS, OCBC and UOB); eight banks from the Asia-Pa­cific re­gion (Aus­tralia and New Zealand Bank­ing Group, The Bank of Tokyo-Mit­subishi UFJ, Bank of China, CIMB Bank, HSBC, Mizuho Bank, Malayan Bank­ing and Su­mit­omo Mit­sui Bank­ing Cor­po­ra­tion); and nine in­ter­na­tional banks (Bar­clays Bank, Credit Swiss, Citibank, Bank of Amer­ica, BNP Paribas, Deutsche Bank, Stan­dard Char­tered Bank, JP Mor­gan Chase Bank and UBS).</p>
    <p>If fewer than 12 banks sub­mit their quotes, the Si­bor rate will be un­avail­able for that day. After delet­ing the top and bot­tom quar­tiles, the re­main­ing rates (which should come from at least 10 banks) are av­er­aged to get the day’s Si­bor.</p>
    <p>Si­bor has been the bench­mark in­ter­est rate not only for Sin­ga­pore but also for other Asian economies. This is to a great ex­tent due to Sin­ga­pore’s po­lit­i­cal sta­bil­ity and re­li­a­bil­ity as an Asian fi­nan­cial hub. Si­bor has a term struc­ture of one-month, three-month, six-month and 12-month. The onemonth and three-month Si­bor are the most pop­u­lar bench­marks. The six-month and 12-month are less widely used and will be dis­con­tin­ued from end-2021 and end-2020 re­spec­tively.</p>
    <p>Si­bor com­monly serves as the bench­mark in­ter­est rate for debt in­stru­ments such as com­mer­cial loans, syn­di­cated loans, mort­gages, trade fi­nanc­ing and work­ing cap­i­tal fi­nanc­ing, and for cur­rency and in­ter­est rate swaps in Asia. It is ap­plied to debt in­stru­ments by adding a credit spread to the quoted rate, for ex­am­ple, three-month Si­bor plus a spread of 25 ba­sis points.</p>
    <p>SORA</p>
    <p>The Sin­ga­pore Overnight Rate Aver­age (Sora) is the rate for un­se­cured overnight in­ter­bank Sin­ga­pore dol­lar trans­ac­tions bro­kered in Sin­ga­pore daily be­tween 8am and 6.15pm. Sora has been pub­lished by the Mon­e­tary Author­ity of Sin­ga­pore (MAS) since July 1, 2005.</p>
    <p>On July 19, the As­so­ci­a­tion of Banks in Sin­ga­pore (ABS), ABS Co, SFEMC (Sin­ga­pore For­eign Ex­change Mar­ket Com­mit­tee) and SC-STS (Steer­ing Com­mit­tee for SOR Tran­si­tion to Sora) re­leased a con­sul­ta­tion pa­per propos­ing the phas­ing out of Si­bor over the next three to four years in favour of Sora.</p>
    <p>The fi­nan­cial in­dus­try has, till the end of next month, to pro­vide its feed­back be­fore a fi­nal ver­dict on the fate of Si­bor is passed.</p>
    <p>On Aug 5, the MAS an­nounced key ini­tia­tives to pro­vide more clar­ity on the re­port­ing of Sora which will be ad­min­is­tered by the MAS.</p>
    <p>WHY IS SORA IM­POR­TANT</p>
    <p>The story be­gan with the Li­bor (Lon­don In­ter­bank Of­fered Rate) scan­dal un­cov­ered in 2012. It ex­posed mar­ket ma­nip­u­la­tion of Li­bor by mem­ber banks that falsely in­flated or de­flated their rates so as to profit from trades.</p>
    <p>The rig­ging of Li­bor re­sulted in bil­lions of fraud­u­lent in­ter­est pay­ments. After the scan­dal, many coun­tries sought a more ro­bust bench­mark in­ter­est rate. The Li­bor will likely cease after end-2021.</p>
    <p>The search for a suit­able re­place­ment was ar­du­ous. Li­bor is deeply em­bed­ded in a range of fi­nan­cial con­tracts. In the United States alone, it serves as a ref­er­ence rate for con­tracts worth over US$200 tril­lion (S$273 tril­lion), which is about three times the to­tal mar­ket cap­i­tal­i­sa­tion of all stocks world­wide last year.</p>
    <p>In Europe, the Ster­ling Overnight In­dex Aver­age (Sonia) will re­place Li­bor by next year. In Switzer­land, the Swiss Aver­age Rate Overnight (Saron) will be used.</p>
    <p>Ja­pan, Aus­tralia, Canada, Hong Kong and the US will use re­spec­tively the Tokyo Overnight Aver­age Rate (Tonar), the Re­serve Bank of Aus­tralia In­ter­bank Overnight Cash Rate (Ao­nia), the Cana­dian Overnight Repo Rate Aver­age (Corra), the Hong Kong Dol­lar Overnight In­dex Aver­age (Ho­nia) and the Se­cured Overnight Fi­nanc­ing Rate (Sofr) in place of the Li­bor.</p>
    <p>These al­ter­na­tive “risk-free” rates are based on real trans­ac­tions, mak­ing them less vul­ner­a­ble to co­or­di­nated price fix­ing.</p>
    <p>The Sofr has been crit­i­cised for its ex­ces­sive volatil­ity, back­ward­look­ing na­ture and lack of term struc­ture. Hence, many fi­nan­cial in­sti­tu­tions are still hes­i­tant about adopt­ing Sofr in case of a liq­uid­ity crunch and fi­nan­cial in­sta­bil­ity.</p>
    <p>Given that Sofr does not have a for­ward curve like Li­bor, the Chicago Mer­can­tile Ex­change started of­fer­ing Sofr fu­tures in 2018. By end2019, there were about US$345 billion in out­stand­ing Sofr swaps. But the size of Sofr de­riv­a­tives is rel­a­tively small com­pared with Li­bor’s.</p>
    <p>There are sim­i­lar is­sues with Sora in­tro­duced in 2005.</p>
    <p>On Aug 5, the MAS an­nounced that Sora will be based on the vol­ume-weighted ac­tual trans­acted rates of 24 re­port­ing banks that are most ac­tive in the Sora mar­ket.</p>
    <p>They in­clude three lo­cal banks (DBS, OCBC and OUB); 10 Asia-Pa­cific banks (Aus­tralia and New Zealand Bank­ing Group, Chang Hwa Com­mer­cial Bank, CIMB Bank, HL Bank, ICBC, Malayan Bank­ing, Mizuho Bank, MUFG Bank, Na­tional Aus­tralia Bank and HSBC); and 11 in­ter­na­tional banks (ABN Amro Bank, Bar­clays Bank, BNP Paribas, Citibank, Com­merzbank, Credit Agri­cole Cor­po­rate & In­vest­ment Bank, Deutsche Bank, ING Bank, KBC Bank, Natixis and Stan­dard Char­tered Bank).</p>
    <p>This list is sub­ject to pe­ri­odic re­view by the MAS. Nat­u­rally, the shorter list of re­port­ing banks from the Sora mar­ket will re­duce Sora volatil­ity, an im­por­tant qual­ity for a ro­bust bench­mark in­ter­est rate.</p>
    <p>Sec­ond, the Sora for one-month, three-month and six-month tenors are com­pounded from past daily Sora. Hence, there is no cor­re­spond­ing for­ward-look­ing term spreads.</p>
    <p>The fi­nanc­ing cost of in­ter­e­strate-re­lated prod­ucts such as loans and mort­gages un­der Sora will de­pend on the spe­cific cred­it­wor­thi­ness of the bor­row­ers and the mar­ket con­di­tions.</p>
    <p>To have a more com­plete pic­ture of the im­pact on the fi­nal fi­nanc­ing cost, more data will be needed.</p>
    <p>DBS and MAS have re­cently of­fered Sora-based Float­ing Rate Notes (FRN) to fa­cil­i­tate a deep­en­ing of the Sora mar­ket. The phas­ing out of Si­bor over three to four years will pro­vide am­ple time for the mar­ket to ad­just and tran­sit to Sora whereas other coun­tries face a more ur­gent time­line, given that Li­bor will cease by next year-end. the Na­tional Univer­sity of Sin­ga­pore Busi­ness School’s depart­ment of fi­nance. The opin­ions ex­pressed are of the writ­ers and do not rep­re­sent NUS’ views and opin­ions.</p>
