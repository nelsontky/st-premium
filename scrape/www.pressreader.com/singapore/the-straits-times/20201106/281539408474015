    <p>The min­istry said that from 2017 to 2018, it had con­ducted in­ves­ti­ga­tions into Ms Parti’s complaint of il­le­gal de­ploy­ment against her former em­ploy­ers. At the con­clu­sion of its in­ves­ti­ga­tions,</p>
    <p>MOM con­sulted the At­tor­ney-Gen­eral’s Cham­bers and is­sued a cau­tion to Mrs Liew Mun Leong and an ad­vi­sory no­tice to her son, Karl Liew.</p>
    <p>The Min­istry of Man­power (MOM) has re­viewed its re­sponse to a complaint from former do­mes­tic worker Parti Liyani in the light of her ac­quit­tal, and has de­cided that no fur­ther ac­tion will be taken.</p>
    <p>MOM said yes­ter­day that fol­low­ing the ob­ser­va­tions made dur­ing Ms Parti’s case at the High Court in Septem­ber, it had ini­ti­ated a re­view of the case and con­ducted fur­ther in­ves­ti­ga­tions.</p>
    <p>Ms Parti was ac­quit­ted by the High Court i n Septem­ber of steal­ing from her former em­ploy­ers, the fam­ily of former Changi Air­port Group chair­man Liew Mun Leong, in a case which had sparked pub­lic up­roar and raised ques­tions about the crim­i­nal jus­tice sys­tem.</p>
    <p>The min­istry said that from 2017 to 2018, it had con­ducted in­ves­ti­ga­tions into Ms Parti’s complaint of il­le­gal de­ploy­ment against her former em­ploy­ers.</p>
    <p>At the con­clu­sion of its in­ves­ti­ga­tions, MOM con­sulted the At­tor­ney-Gen­eral’s Cham­bers (AGC) and is­sued a cau­tion to Mrs Liew</p>
    <p>Mun Leong and an ad­vi­sory no­tice to her son, Karl Liew.</p>
    <p>The min­istry re­viewed this re­sponse in the light of Ms Parti’s ac­quit­tal and con­sulted AGC on its rec­om­men­da­tions.</p>
    <p>“AGC has af­firmed the ear­lier ac­tions taken by MOM against Ms Parti’s former em­ploy­ers on her il­le­gal de­ploy­ment to Karl Liew’s home and of­fice, and has di­rected that no fur­ther ac­tion be taken against the par­ties in­volved in this mat­ter,” said MOM.</p>
    <p>Ms Parti had made a re­port in Oc­to­ber 2017 of her il­le­gal de­ploy­ment by Mrs Liew to her son’s res­i­dence be­tween Septem­ber and Oc­to­ber 2016, and to his of­fice around 2012 and 2013.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, Karl Liew ap­peared in a district court and was charged with giv­ing false in­for­ma­tion to a pub­lic ser­vant.</p>
    <p>The 43-year-old is also ac­cused of giv­ing false ev­i­dence dur­ing a ju­di­cial pro­ceed­ing.</p>
    <p>Law and Home Af­fairs Min­is­ter K. Shan­mugam de­liv­ered a min­is­te­rial state­ment on Ms Parti’s case in Par­lia­ment on Wed­nes­day and said that while lapses in how the case was han­dled were found, there was no im­proper in­flu­ence in the case.</p>
    <p>The min­is­ter also said that AGC would se­ri­ously con­sider look­ing into al­le­ga­tions of per­jury or other se­ri­ous of­fences should such find­ings arise in court-is­sued judg­ments or de­ci­sions in le­gal pro­ceed­ings.</p>
