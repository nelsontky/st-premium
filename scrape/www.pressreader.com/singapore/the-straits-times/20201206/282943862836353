    <p>Aries (March 21 - April 19)</p>
    <p>Take care of your health. There is just no get­ting around it. See if you can get your friends to help you fig­ure out a new rou­tine so you do not fall back into bad habits.</p>
    <p>Taurus (April 20 - May 20)</p>
    <p>You need to turn on the charm, but it is eas­ier than usual. Your great in­ter­per­sonal en­ergy is in sync with what peo­ple need, so you can im­press peo­ple with ease.</p>
    <p>Gemini (May 21 - June 20)</p>
    <p>A flash of un­der­stand­ing crosses your mind, so you can ex­plain the sit­u­a­tion to those who are still in the dark. Your great men­tal en­ergy makes you a bril­liant ed­u­ca­tor.</p>
    <p>Cancer (June 21 - July 22)</p>
    <p>It is time to clean up your act or at least clean up your desk. You have the right kind of en­ergy to make your life and space more beau­ti­ful, and that is its own re­ward.</p>
    <p>Leo (July 23 - Aug 22)</p>
    <p>Re­think your ap­proach. It is just not do­ing what you need it to do. That is not to say you should give up – just that some new in­for­ma­tion is key to your suc­cess.</p>
    <p>Virgo (Aug 23 - Sept 22)</p>
    <p>Start some­thing big, bold and new. Your en­ergy is right for begin­nings of all kinds. Some peo­ple may need more con­vinc­ing, but your com­mu­ni­ca­tion skills are pow­er­ful.</p>
    <p>Libra (Sept 23 - Oct 22)</p>
    <p>You are hav­ing a hard time sep­a­rat­ing the de­tails mak­ing life need­lessly com­plex. This could be the day it falls apart, but the good news is that you get a clean slate.</p>
    <p>Scor­pio (Oct 23 - Nov 21)</p>
    <p>Your com­mit­ment to oth­ers is stronger than ever, as is your abil­ity to make a real dif­fer­ence in their lives. One tiny ac­tion could have enor­mous con­se­quences.</p>
    <p>Sagittariu­s (Nov 22 - Dec 21)</p>
    <p>Hunker down and avoid caus­ing a stir. Make sure that you are not ask­ing for more than other peo­ple are will­ing to give, as re­sent­ment is easy to stir up.</p>
    <p>Capricorn (Dec 22 - Jan 19)</p>
    <p>You should get more done than you ex­pect, so take on as much as you can han­dle. It is one of those days when you are pretty sure that magic is real, though you can­not prove it.</p>
    <p>Aquarius (Jan 20 - Feb 18)</p>
    <p>Try to get a grip on what is go­ing on at work or in the neigh­bour­hood. Ap­pear­ances are not enough to go on. Ask ques­tions, work from hunches and see what is real.</p>
    <p>Pisces (Feb 19 - March 20)</p>
    <p>This is not a time for deep thought. You need to take ac­tion. The good news is that it will all make sense later, though it may take a few days or months to be­come clear to you.</p>
