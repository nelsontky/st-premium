    <p>Fin­tech in Sin­ga­pore has shown re­mark­able re­silience even as the econ­omy faces its worst down­turn amid the coro­n­avirus pan­demic. The surge in the use of dig­i­tal ser­vices dur­ing the Covid-19 cri­sis is ex­pected to fur­ther en­trench the Republic as a global fin­tech hub.</p>
    <p>Fin­tech in Sin­ga­pore has shown re­mark­able re­silience even as the econ­omy faces its worst down­turn amid the coro­n­avirus out­break.</p>
    <p>The surge in dig­i­tal ser­vices use dur­ing the Covid-19 cri­sis is ex­pected to fur­ther en­trench the Republic as a global fin­tech hub.</p>
    <p>The num­ber of fin­tech com­pa­nies here has grown to 1,000 this year.</p>
    <p>This is up from 600 last year, which saw a net in­crease of about 4,900 jobs in fi­nan­cial ser­vices and fin­tech, ac­cord­ing to the Mon­e­tary Au­thor­ity of Sin­ga­pore (MAS).</p>
    <p>Re­flect­ing un­flinch­ing in­vestor fo­cus on the in­dus­try, fin­tech firms in Sin­ga­pore raised $462 mil­lion in eq­uity fund­ing in the first half of this year – 19 per cent higher than over the same pe­riod last year, said BCG Fin­Tech Con­trol Tower, a re­search-fo­cused unit de­vel­oped jointly by the Bos­ton Con­sult­ing Group and Ex­pand Re­search.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to the Sin­ga­pore Ex­change (SGX), the most traded fin­tech-fo­cused stocks in re­cent months in­clude iFast, Sy­nagie and Sil­ver­lake Axis. The trio have av­er­aged a 21 per cent to­tal re­turn this year to last Wed­nes­day.</p>
    <p>There is a good chance that some of Sin­ga­pore’s home-grown pure fin­tech com­pa­nies will achieve uni­corn sta­tus – uni­corns be­ing star­tups with a value ex­ceed­ing US$1 bil­lion (S$1.39 bil­lion) – over the next few years, said Dr John Chessher, se­nior ad­viser at Sin­ga­pore’s Stir­ling Cole­man Cap­i­tal.</p>
    <p>Cur­rent con­tenders in­clude Smartkarma, a plat­form which pro­vides in­vest­ment re­search, and Everex, which is a blockchain-based so­lu­tions provider for set­tle­ments, trans­fers and cur­rency ex­change, Dr Chessher wrote in an SGX mar­ket up­date re­port.</p>
    <p>“Sin­ga­pore has put tremen­dous ef­fort into pro­vid­ing en­cour­age­ment and sup­port for fin­tech star­tups and hav­ing a high-pro­file pure fin­tech win­ner would be a con­fir­ma­tion that this strat­egy has been a suc­cess, as well as strength­en­ing the coun­try’s po­si­tion as a pre­ferred des­ti­na­tion for in­ter­na­tional tal­ent and cap­i­tal,” he said.</p>
    <p>An­other mea­sure of suc­cess in the fin­tech uni­verse is the ac­qui­si­tion of a start-up by a larger peer. Back i n March, for i nstance, Hong Kong-based AMTD Group ac­quired a con­trol­ling stake in Pol­i­cyPal, an in­surtech firm with a dig­i­tal in­sur­ance bro­ker­age li­cence from MAS.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore’s fin­tech sec­tor saw a to­tal of $188 mil­lion in merger and ac­qui­si­tion deals in the first six months of this year, said MAS.</p>
    <p>Fin­tech covers a broad range of ver­ti­cals from mo­bile pay­ments and crowd­fund­ing to in­sur­ance.</p>
    <p>It is a core part of the Smart Na­tion ini­tia­tive, launched in 2014 to take Sin­ga­pore to the fore­front of dig­i­tal trans­for­ma­tion.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore was ranked fourth among the top global fin­tech hubs – be­hind the San Fran­cisco Bay area, London and New York – by the Fin­dex­able Global Fin­tech In­dex 2020.</p>
    <p>In­surtech, lend­ing and pay­ments were the Republic’s par­tic­u­lar strengths.</p>
    <p>The in­dex tipped TenX, Quoine and Ky­ber Net­work as lo­cal fin­tech lead­ers.</p>
    <p>Dr Chessher said the strength of the fin­tech in­dus­try here owes a lot to the Sin­ga­pore Gov­ern­ment’s multi-pronged ap­proach to pro­mote its de­vel­op­ment.</p>
    <p>“Sin­ga­pore has ar­guably been unique in its fin­tech-spe­cific ini­tia­tives,” he said.</p>
    <p>“In 2015, the MAS ap­pointed a chief fin­tech of­fi­cer who has fo­cused on three key ar­eas: help­ing fi­nan­cial in­sti­tu­tions em­brace and adopt dig­i­tal tech­nol­ogy, en­abling fin­techs to grow and part­ner­ing with banks and other fi­nan­cial in­sti­tu­tions.”</p>
    <p>In ad­di­tion to the usual sup­port given to early-stage busi­nesses by en­ti­ties, such as Startup SG, spe­cific fin­tech hubs have been es­tab­lished and a num­ber of gov­ern­ment ini­tia­tives have pro­vided im­pe­tus to lo­cal fin­tech de­vel­op­ment.</p>
    <p>Those ini­tia­tives in­clude the Global Trade Con­nec­tiv­ity Net­work, which aims at digi­tis­ing trade fi­nanc­ing, and Project Ubin, which in­ves­ti­gates the use of dis­trib­uted ledger tech­nol­ogy and blockchain for clear­ing and set­tle­ment ac­tiv­i­ties.</p>
    <p>Last year, MAS an­nounced that it would is­sue up to five dig­i­tal bank­ing li­cences.</p>
    <p>The April award of 5G li­cences will also open up a range of new pos­si­bil­i­ties in the fin­tech sec­tor.</p>
