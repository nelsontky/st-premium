    <p>The mas­ter­mind of a brazen day­light rob­bery at an Ang Mo Kio jew­ellery store last year was jailed for three years and three months and sen­tenced to six strokes of the cane yes­ter­day af­ter mak­ing off with nearly $120,000 worth of valu­ables.</p>
    <p>M. Je­gath­eesh, 28, had con­spired with two other men, Shar­avin­dran Sup­piah, 32, and Veera­mani Subran Das, 37, the court heard. All three are Sin­ga­pore­ans.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, Je­gath­eesh pleaded guilty to en­gag­ing in a con­spir­acy to rob Hock Cheong Jade and Jew­ellery shop at Block 574 Ang Mo Kio Av­enue 10 on Aug 14 last year.</p>
    <p>Shar­avin­dran ad­mit­ted to of­fences in­clud­ing dis­hon­estly re­ceiv­ing the stolen prop­erty and will be sen­tenced to­day.</p>
    <p>Veera­mani, who drove the get­away car, was sen­tenced to three years’ jail with six strokes of the cane on Nov 2 af­ter plead­ing guilty to his role in the heist.</p>
    <p>Deputy Public Prose­cu­tors Thi­agesh Suku­maran and Jeremy Bin said that Je­gath­eesh met the two oth­ers in Gey­lang around 9pm on Aug 13 last year to plan the jew­ellery shop rob­bery.</p>
    <p>The court heard that Je­gath­eesh tar­geted the shop as it looked old and as­sumed that it was not in­stalled with an alarm sys­tem. He was also aware that the own­ers, Mr Ling Hew Kwong, 70, and his brother, Mr Leng Yew Weng, 75,</p>
    <p>“were of ad­vanced age”.</p>
    <p>The fol­low­ing day, on Aug 14, Veera­mani met Je­gath­eesh in a car at a carpark near Block 521 Ang Mo Kio Av­enue 5 around 2.40pm.</p>
    <p>Je­gath­eesh en­tered the store around 4pm and tried to pull down the roller shut­ter at its en­trance.</p>
    <p>When it got stuck midway, he shouted at Mr Ling and his brother and jumped over a jew­ellery counter.</p>
    <p>Amid the com­mo­tion, the two shop own­ers man­aged to press the hid­den alarm but­tons to alert an ex­ter­nal se­cu­rity firm about the rob­bery.</p>
    <p>The DPPs said that Je­gath­eesh then “swept the jew­ellery, in­clud­ing gold neck­laces, bracelets, and pen­dants, into his duf­fle bag”.</p>
    <p>The two shop own­ers did not con­front Je­gath­eesh as he was big­ger than them. Mr Ling, how­ever, shouted for help, alert­ing two peo­ple nearby, and one of them called the po­lice.</p>
    <p>Je­gath­eesh dashed out of the store with his loot and got into the car driven by Veera­mani. The two men parted ways at an Ang Mo Kio carpark. Veera­mani went on to meet Shar­avin­dran later that day.</p>
    <p>The po­lice man­aged to ar­rest all three and re­cov­ered the stolen valu­ables.</p>
