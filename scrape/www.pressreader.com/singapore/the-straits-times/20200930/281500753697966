    <p>Fewer riders and stepped-up clean­ing of trains and buses dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker pe­riod made for hap­pier com­muters this year.</p>
    <p>An on­line sur­vey con­ducted by the Sin­ga­pore Man­age­ment Univer­sity (SMU) of about 7,500 peo­ple showed “sub­stan­tial in­creases” in com­muter sat­is­fac­tion scores from May to July, com­pared with the same pe­riod last year.</p>
    <p>While the MRT sys­tem scored 66.1 points in the sur­vey in the same pe­riod last year, its score rose to 73.4 this year.</p>
    <p>Sat­is­fac­tion with public buses like­wise went up from 68.9 points to 74.4 points in the same pe­riod.</p>
    <p>This is de­spite scores reg­is­tered in June and July – after the cir­cuit breaker ended – grad­u­ally re­vert­ing to last year’s lev­els.</p>
    <p>Pre­sent­ing the re­sults yesterday, Mr Chen Yong Chang, head of re­search and con­sult­ing at the SMU’s In­sti­tute of Ser­vice Ex­cel­lence, said that with more peo­ple re­turn­ing to work, com­muters are ask­ing for more.</p>
    <p>“Some re­spon­dents are ask­ing for higher ser­vice fre­quency, more crowd con­trol of­fi­cers and to limit the num­ber of pas­sen­gers per cabin as trains and buses be­come more crowded post-cir­cuit breaker,” he said.</p>
    <p>“To be fair, there’s a limit to what op­er­a­tors can do be­cause the crowds have to come back.</p>
    <p>“The Govern­ment may do more to en­cour­age mea­sures like flex­i­ble work ar­range­ments.”</p>
    <p>While fac­tors such as cleanlines­s were most im­por­tant in May, more peren­nial con­cerns like ser­vice re­li­a­bil­ity and ac­cu­racy of travel in­for­ma­tion are now also re­turn­ing to the fore of com­muters’ con­sid­er­a­tions, Mr Chen added.</p>
    <p>It will take a while more be­fore the new nor­mal for con­sumer sat­is­fac­tion sta­bilises in a post-pan­demic world, he said, and more con­clu­sions can then be drawn from it.</p>
    <p>The lack of tourists meant this year’s re­sults in sat­is­fac­tion lev­els for air­ports and air­lines were not com­pa­ra­ble with last year’s, with only Sin­ga­pore­ans and per­ma­nent res­i­dents sur­veyed in the re­cent poll.</p>
    <p>Still, the SMU sur­vey found that 85.6 per cent of re­spon­dents are will­ing to fly within a year of air travel re­stric­tions be­ing lifted, and</p>
    <p>that 39 per cent are will­ing to fly within a month of flights be­ing al­lowed to re­sume.</p>
    <p>Their top des­ti­na­tions are Aus</p>
    <p>tralia, Ja­pan, Malaysia and China.</p>
    <p>Mr Chen said that with more flights grounded and the travel sit­u­a­tion un­pre­dictable, air­lines</p>
    <p>may have to fo­cus more on ser­vice and brand­ing rather than flights to be “best poised to cap­ture pent-up de­mand when pas­sen­ger numbers re­bound”. Th­ese can in­clude re­design­ing the cus­tomer jour­ney from check-in to land­ing, for in­stance, in­cor­po­rat­ing the wear­ing of per­sonal pro­tec­tive equip­ment.</p>
    <p>More im­me­di­ately, air­lines must en­sure the ease of re­fund and the qual­ity of their in­ter­ac­tions with cus­tomers to re­tain loy­alty, said Mr Chen.</p>
    <p>He added: “This is es­pe­cially im­por­tant be­cause the dy­nam­ics keep chang­ing. Pas­sen­gers will re­mem­ber good ser­vice dur­ing this con­fus­ing pe­riod and will choose the air­line again when re­cov­ery comes.”</p>
    <p>When the land and air sec­tors were com­pared, peo­ple gave Changi Air­port the high­est rat­ing at 8.08 points on a scale of 10 when it came to per­cep­tion of ef­forts to keep peo­ple safe from Covid-19.</p>
    <p>Train op­er­a­tors got the low­est rat­ing, at 7.06 points.</p>
    <p>Ms Neeta Lach­man­das, ex­ec­u­tive di­rec­tor of the In­sti­tute of Ser­vice Ex­cel­lence, said: “This is not sur­pris­ing. The air­ports are emp­tier be­cause of the lack of tourists, while the trains are more crowded after the cir­cuit breaker re­stric­tions were lifted.”</p>
    <p>She added: “When we en­ter very crowded in­door spa­ces, we all have a voice in the back of our heads that goes, ‘I hope it’s safe and I don’t catch some­thing’.”</p>

While the MRT sys&#xAD;tem scored 66.1 points in the com&#xAD;muter sat&#xAD;is&#xAD;fac&#xAD;tion poll last year, its score rose to 73.4 this year, due to less con&#xAD;ges&#xAD;tion and more fre&#xAD;quent clean&#xAD;ing.</p>
