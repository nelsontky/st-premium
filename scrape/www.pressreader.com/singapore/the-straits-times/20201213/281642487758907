    <p>NEW YORK • In its emer­gency au­tho­ri­sa­tion of the Pfizer-BioNTech vac­cine on Fri­day night, the Food and Drug Ad­min­is­tra­tion (FDA) took an un­ex­pected step, leav­ing open the pos­si­bil­ity that preg­nant and breast­feed­ing women may opt for im­mu­ni­sa­tion against the coro­n­avirus.</p>
    <p>The agency au­tho­rised the vac­cine for any­one 16 and older, and asked Pfizer to file reg­u­lar re­ports on the safety of the vac­cine, in­clud­ing its use in preg­nant women.</p>
    <p>There had been no guar­an­tee that the agency would take this route. The vac­cine was not tested in preg­nant women or in those who were breast­feed­ing.</p>
    <p>Reg­u­la­tors i n Bri­tain rec­om­mended against these women re­ceiv­ing the shots even while ac­knowl­edg­ing that the ev­i­dence so far “raises no con­cerns for safety in preg­nancy”.</p>
    <p>The vac­cine has not been en­dorsed for preg­nant women by the Cen­tres for Dis­ease Con­trol and Pre­ven­tion, but an ad­vi­sory com­mit­tee to the agency is ex­pected to meet this week­end to make fur­ther rec­om­men­da­tions.</p>
    <p>Some ex­perts said the virus it­self poses greater risks to preg­nant women than the new vac­cine, and noted that vac­cines have been given to preg­nant women for decades and have been over­whelm­ingly safe.</p>
    <p>“This is a re­ally huge step for­ward in recog­nis­ing women’s au­ton­omy to make de­ci­sions about their own health­care,” said Dr Emily Miller, an ob­ste­tri­cian at North­west­ern Univer­sity and a mem­ber of the Covid-19 task force of the So­ci­ety for Ma­ter­nal and Fe­tal Medicine (SMFM).</p>
    <p>With the first doses of the vac­cine re­served for health­care work­ers and res­i­dents of long-term care fa­cil­i­ties, the FDA’s au­tho­ri­sa­tion most im­me­di­ately af­fects the es­ti­mated 330,000 preg­nant and breast­feed­ing health­care work­ers in the United States.</p>
    <p>“I am in­cred­i­bly sup­port­ive of the FDA’s de­ci­sion to leave the door open to Covid-19 vac­ci­na­tion for preg­nant and lac­tat­ing work­ers,” said bioethi­cist Ruth Faden at Johns Hop­kins Univer­sity in Bal­ti­more.</p>
    <p>Some health­care work­ers are at high risk of Covid-19, ei­ther be­cause their jobs bring them into in­tense con­tact with the virus – for ex­am­ple, clean­ing the rooms of sick pa­tients – or be­cause they live in low-in­come and multi­gen­er­a­tional homes, she said. “We have to be able to give women the op­por­tu­nity to think through this for them­selves with who­ever it is pro­vid­ing ob­stet­ri­cal care to them.”</p>
    <p>None of the vac­cine clin­i­cal tri­als have so far in­cluded preg­nant or lac­tat­ing women, nor even women who are plan­ning to get preg­nant; some tri­als are ex­pected to be­gin next month. Still, the Amer­i­can Col­lege of Ob­stet­rics and Gyne­col­ogy, the SMFM and other or­gan­i­sa­tions have been calling on the FDA to al­low preg­nant and lac­tat­ing peo­ple ac­cess to the vac­cine.</p>
    <p>The Emer­gency Use Au­tho­ri­sa­tion did not en­dorse the vac­cine for preg­nant or breast­feed­ing women, other than to note that Pfizer should col­lect long-term data on how the vac­cine per­forms in preg­nant women.</p>
