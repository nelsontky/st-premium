    <p>Creepy con­spir­acy the­o­ries on vac­cines</p>
    <p>Maria Ceres Doyo Philip­pine Daily Inquirer, The Philip­pines</p>
    <p>Just when the man­u­fac­tur­ers of Covid-19 vac­cines brought tid­ings that the roll-out of their prod­ucts is not far off, and lead­ers of badly stricken coun­tries are heav­ing sighs of relief, many con­spir­acy the­o­ries are com­ing out of the wood­work and cir­cu­lat­ing in so­cial me­dia.</p>
    <p>Those is­su­ing the warn­ings were of dif­fer­ent back­grounds and dis­ci­plines – a church pas­tor here, med­i­cal doc­tors there – all com­ing from left field, each one telling the pub­lic that those be­hind the Covid-19 vac­cines are out to hurt hu­man­ity.</p>
    <p>These charges are straight out of a dystopian novel or movie of the sci-fi genre, but the warn­ings sound con­vinc­ing enough that many find it their duty to pass on the in­for­ma­tion.</p>
    <p>The ones re­cently for­warded to me ar­gued how the vac­cines would al­ter peo­ple’s DNA, mak­ing them akin to GMOs (ge­net­i­cally mod­i­fied or­gan­isms), that there is a com­po­nent called lu­ciferase (as in Lu­cifer) be­cause it car­ries light; that there are crys­talline par­ti­cles and lit­tle ro­bots that can take your bio­met­ric data and store them in the cloud, and so on and so forth.</p>
    <p>Of course, there have been con­spir­acy the­o­ries in the past that later turned out to be true, and so the ones re­lated to Covid-19 are not to be laughed at just yet.</p>
    <p>An Agence France-Presse ar­ti­cle quotes from a First Draft re­port: “When peo­ple can’t eas­ily ac­cess re­li­able in­for­ma­tion around vac­cines and when mis­trust in ac­tors and in­sti­tu­tions re­lated to vac­cines is high, mis­in­for­ma­tion nar­ra­tives rush in to fill the vac­uum.”</p>
    <p>The con­spir­acy the­o­ries sound creepy in­deed, but why are the health ex­perts, the cre­ators of the vac­cines, the molecular bi­ol­o­gists and other sci­en­tists who have hu­mankind’s health in mind not say­ing much to de­bunk all these charges that are go­ing vi­ral?</p>
    <p>A vac­cine-hes­i­tant pop­u­la­tion could prove to be dead­lier than a “deadly” vac­cine.</p>
    <p>Edi­to­rial</p>
    <p>Sin Chew Daily, Malaysia</p>
    <p>With stag­ger­ing new in­fec­tion num­bers and no end in sight for the out­break, it is un­der­stand­able that many peo­ple have be­come in­creas­ingly rest­less, pow­er­less and ea­ger to seek ef­fi­ca­cious al­ter­na­tives to free them­selves from the threat of the virus so that they can re­vert to the nor­mal life they used to know.</p>
    <p>There has been a mul­ti­tude of pre­ven­tive and ther­a­peu­tic for­mu­las all around us but none has been ver­i­fied by med­i­cal ex­perts to be ef­fec­tive.</p>
    <p>Some of the shops in China, for in­stance, are pro­mot­ing the so-called “hy­dro­gen en­ergy pack” that is a “cure-all” so­lu­tion to treat all kinds of dis­eases and is claimed to be ef­fec­tive against the coro­n­avirus. Such claims have nev­er­the­less been re­jected by the Chi­nese au­thor­i­ties.</p>
    <p>In the face of so many reme­dies of all sorts and forms, it is im­per­a­tive that mem­bers of the pub­lic judge sci­en­tif­i­cally and ra­tio­nally, as the slight­est neg­li­gence could mean grave con­se­quences.</p>
    <p>Where bat­tling the virus is con­cerned, we should rely only on in­for­ma­tion pro­vided by the Health Min­istry and med­i­cal pro­fes­sion­als, not hearsay.</p>
    <p>Ad­di­tion­ally, to stop the cir­cu­la­tion of fake in­for­ma­tion on the pre­ven­tion and treat­ment of the coro­n­avirus, the gov­ern­ment should step up pub­lic ed­u­ca­tion as well as en­force­ment, so that no one will fall vic­tim to such scams again.</p>
    <p>Don’t go by hearsay</p>
