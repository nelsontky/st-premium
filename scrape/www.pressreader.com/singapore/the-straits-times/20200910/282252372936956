    <p>The Com­mer­cial Affairs De­part­ment (CAD) of the Sin­ga­pore po­lice has found “rea­son­able grounds” that AGV Group’s ex­ec­u­tive di­rec­tor, Mr Al­bert Ang, has com­mit­ted an of­fence.</p>
    <p>This is in the course of CAD’s probe into false trad­ing and mar­ket-rig­ging trans­ac­tions un­der the Se­cu­ri­ties and Fu­tures Act (SFA).</p>
    <p>Mr Ang had i nformed the board of AGV, a Catal­ist-listed provider of hot-dip gal­vanis­ing ser­vices, that he was called for a sub­se­quent in­ter­view with the CAD on Tues­day.</p>
    <p>He was “put on ar­rest and on bail”, but has not been for­mally charged in court, AGV said in a reg­u­la­tory fil­ing yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Notwith­stand­ing the dif­fi­cul­ties in ar­rang­ing for new credit fa­cil­i­ties as a re­sult of the “un­cer­tainty cre­ated by the in­ves­ti­ga­tion” by the CAD and the Mone­tary Author­ity of Sin­ga­pore (MAS), the group’s busi­ness and op­er­a­tions re­main un­af­fected, AGV said.</p>
    <p>In July, the com­pany said it had re­ceived no­tices from the CAD and MAS ask­ing for in­for­ma­tion and doc­u­ments in re­la­tion to an al­leged of­fence un­der the SFA.</p>
    <p>The of­fence was said to have been com­mit­ted be­tween July 2017 and March 2018.</p>
    <p>AGV did not name the di­rec­tor in its state­ment then, but gave the as­sur­ance that its busi­ness and op­er­a­tions would con­tinue as usual.</p>
    <p>The counter closed at 2.5 cents yes­ter­day, down 7.4 per cent.</p>
