    <p>TAIPEI • Tai­wanese ac­tor Talu Wang’s sig­na­ture smile is back, about a week af­ter his mother’s death.</p>
    <p>She died at the age of 65 on Aug 9 as a re­sult of a rup­tured brain stem tu­mour, which was pre­vi­ously un­di­ag­nosed.</p>
    <p>Wang, 29, had not been seen in pub­lic since then, with his agency re­leas­ing a sim­ple state­ment to the me­dia af­ter her death and his fam­ily hold­ing a low-key fu­neral.</p>
    <p>The ac­tor looked to have over­come his sor­row in the lat­est photos posted of him last Satur­day, taken on the side­lines of a game of bad­minton with friends such as ac­tor Chen Bolin and ac­tress Ivy Chen.</p>
    <p>In photos posted on so­cial me­dia by Ivy Chen, Wang looked to be in good spirits. He was smil­ing in one photo and pre­tend­ing to smash with his bad­minton racket in an­other.</p>
    <p>Chen, 37, said on so­cial me­dia that she met a group of friends to play bad­minton over the weekend, and those who were not in the photos were on the court.</p>
    <p>“We al­most couldn’t smile af­ter play­ing for more than four hours,” she added.</p>
    <p>Wang shot to promi­nence af­ter act­ing in the Tai­wanese film Our Times (2015) along­side ac­tress Vi­vian Sung. He has since acted in other well-re­ceived movies such as Fall In Love At First Kiss (2019) and</p>
    <p>A Choo (2020).</p>
    <p>Chen Bo-lin, 36, also caught the at­ten­tion of fans, as they noted that his hair has reached shoul­der length. The ac­tor, who got his big break in the movie Blue Gate Cross­ing (2002), is known for his clean­cut good looks with short hair.</p>
    <p>One of the fans joked that Chen Bo-lin is now “pret­tier” than Ivy Chen, and she re­sponded sport­ingly that she agreed and said his hair was “su­per soft”.</p>
    <p>Ivy Chen is fa­mous for act­ing in the movie Hear Me (2009), i n which she starred with Michelle Chen and Ed­die Peng. It won her the Best Ac­tress award at the Taipei Film Fes­ti­val.</p>
