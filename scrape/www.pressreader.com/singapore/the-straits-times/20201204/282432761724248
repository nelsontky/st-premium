    <p>TURIN • Stephanie Frap­part be­came the first woman to ref­eree a men’s Cham­pi­ons League game on Wed­nes­day as Cris­tiano Ron­aldo scored his 750th ca­reer goal in a 3-0 win for Ju­ven­tus over Dy­namo Kiev.</p>
    <p>The 36-year-old had al­ready made his­tory as the first woman to ref­eree in the French Ligue 1, and was also in charge of last year’s Uefa Su­per Cup fi­nal be­tween Liver­pool and Chelsea.</p>
    <p>The French­woman made her Europa League de­but in Oc­to­ber and has now taken an­other step in her ca­reer.</p>
    <p>“An­other bar­rier has been bro­ken down, we know that she is very good, which is the most im­por­tant and fun­da­men­tal thing,” Juve chief foot­ball of­fi­cer Fabio Paratici said.</p>
    <p>Fed­erico Chiesa and Al­varo Mo­rata were also on tar­get for the Italian cham­pi­ons, who were al­ready through to the last 16, along with Group G lead­ers Barcelona. But they can still pip the Span­ish La Liga side to top spot.</p>
    <p>Juve sit three points be­hind Barca ahead of their trip to the Nou Camp next Tues­day.</p>
    <p>“We’re ready for Barcelona,” said Juve coach An­drea Pirlo, whose side lost 2-0 to Barca in</p>
    <p>Turin, a game Ron­aldo missed due to a pos­i­tive coro­n­avirus test.</p>
    <p>“Th­ese are games that change the season in terms of self-es­teem and we will go there to win. But first there’s the (Turin) derby and we need to fo­cus on the league.</p>
    <p>“Even if we are qual­i­fied, it’s im­por­tant not only for the clas­si­fi­ca­tion, but for our progress.</p>
    <p>“But I’m sat­is­fied with the game and the ap­proach of the guys. I’m young and I know I have to im­prove like my players, but I go on with my work.”</p>
    <p>Else­where, Borus­sia Dort­mund over­came the ab­sence of their in­jured striker Er­ling Braut Haa­land to draw 1-1 with Lazio in Group F, ad­vanc­ing to the knock­out phase with a game to spare.</p>
    <p>Coach Lu­cien Favre re­vealed their top scorer, who has 16 goals in 12 Cham­pi­ons League ap­pear­ances, had a mus­cle in­jury that will rule him out un­til next month but</p>
    <p>Raphael Guer­reiro’s strike in Italy was enough for the Ger­mans.</p>
    <p>“We lost 3-1 in Rome, we im­proved tonight and could have won it with our chances,” the Swiss said. “In the end, it was not our best per­for­mance but we have qual­i­fied. That is what was im­por­tant tonight.”</p>
    <p>Lazio still need at least a draw against Club Brugge next week to ad­vance to the last 16.</p>
