    <p>In­dia’s to­tal num­ber of Covid-19 cases passed nine mil­lion yes­ter­day, with over 132,000 deaths from the dis­ease so far, ac­cord­ing to the lat­est of­fi­cial fig­ures. The coun­try has seen a drop in daily cases over the past month, but it is still reg­is­ter­ing about 45,000 new cases on av­er­age ev­ery day.</p>
    <p>NEW DELHI In­dia’s coro­n­avirus caseload passed the nine mil­lion mark yes­ter­day, as hos­pi­tals in the cap­i­tal New Delhi came un­der in­creas­ing pres­sure and grave­yards be­gan to fill up.</p>
    <p>The world’s sec­ond worst-hit coun­try in terms of the num­ber of Covid-19 cases has now also reg­is­tered more than 132,000 deaths, ac­cord­ing to the lat­est of­fi­cial fig­ures, which are widely seen as un­der­stat­ing the true scale of in­fec­tion.</p>
    <p>In­dia has seen a drop in daily cases over the past month, but it is still reg­is­ter­ing about 45,000 new in­fec­tions on av­er­age ev­ery day.</p>
    <p>New Delhi – fac­ing the dual scourge of win­ter pol­lu­tion and the pan­demic – has seen in­fec­tions soar past half a mil­lion, with a record rise in daily cases. On Thurs­day, the city’s gov­ern­ment quadru­pled fines for not wear­ing a mask in an ef­fort to tackle the out­break.</p>
    <p>At one of Delhi’s largest ceme­ter­ies, burial space is fast run­ning out, said gravedig­ger Mo­hammed Shamim.</p>
    <p>“Ini­tially when the virus broke (out), I thought I’ll bury 100 to 200 peo­ple and it’ll be done. But the cur­rent sit­u­a­tion is be­yond my wildest thoughts,” he said.</p>
    <p>“I only have space left for about 50 to 60 buri­als. Then what? I have no idea.”</p>
    <p>In­dia im­posed a strin­gent lock­down in March, but re­stric­tions have been grad­u­ally eased as the gov­ern­ment seeks to re­boot the econ­omy af­ter the loss of mil­lions of jobs. Ex­perts say this has al­lowed the dis­ease to spread, as has a gen­eral re­luc­tance to wear masks and main­tain so­cial dis­tanc­ing.</p>
    <p>But those re­stric­tions are now com­ing back.</p>
    <p>The au­thor­i­ties in the west­ern city of Ahmed­abad have im­posed a com­plete cur­few over the week­end.</p>
    <p>“Dur­ing this pe­riod, only shops sell­ing milk and medicines shall be per­mit­ted to re­main open,” lo­cal of­fi­cial Ra­jiv Kumar Gupta said.</p>
    <p>Dr Anand Kr­ish­nan, a com­mu­nity medicine pro­fes­sor at Delhi’s All In­dia In­sti­tute of Med­i­cal Sciences, said: “The in­crease in num­bers of cases is a con­cern, pri­mar­ily be­cause it is driven by peo­ple not fol­low­ing the ba­sic pro­to­col of Covid-19-ap­pro­pri­ate be­hav­iour.”</p>
    <p>Dr He­mant She­wade, a Ban­ga­lore-based com­mu­nity medicine ex­pert, said it was likely that cases out­side ma­jor towns and cities were not be­ing taken into ac­count in the of­fi­cial num­bers.</p>
    <p>He added: “My guess is that it is spread­ing slowly and silently in ru­ral ar­eas.”</p>
    <p>In Delhi, the spec­tre of the virus wreak­ing havoc has come back to haunt its 20 mil­lion res­i­dents, as fam­i­lies scram­ble to get hos­pi­tal beds. Over 90 per cent of in­ten­sive care beds with ven­ti­la­tors were oc­cu­pied as at Thurs­day, a gov­ern­ment mo­bile app showed.</p>
    <p>Dis­traught fam­i­lies made fer­vent pleas on so­cial me­dia, tag­ging Delhi Chief Min­is­ter Arvind Ke­jri­wal for help in se­cur­ing beds.</p>
    <p>Un­der pres­sure to con­trol the new wave, Mr Ke­jri­wal on Thurs­day an­nounced the ad­di­tion of 1,400 in­ten­sive care beds.</p>
    <p>Mr Jeeven­dra Sri­vas­tava, a 47-year-old ad­ver­tis­ing pro­fes­sional, said Delhi was pay­ing the price for over­crowd­ing dur­ing the on­go­ing fes­tive sea­son.</p>
    <p>“It’s shock­ing how a few peo­ple are still not tak­ing this deadly virus se­ri­ously,” he said.</p>
    <p>“Peo­ple are still go­ing to crowded places with­out masks. It’s be­cause of this ir­re­spon­si­ble be­hav­iour that now al­most ev­ery sec­ond house has a case of the virus.”</p>
