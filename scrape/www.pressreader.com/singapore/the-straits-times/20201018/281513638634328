    <p>“Just like a li­brary, just like a li­brary,” sang the Hougang Hools as the Sin­ga­pore Pre­mier League (SPL) re­sumed yes­ter­day with games at Our Tampines Hub and Jurong East Sta­dium.</p>
    <p>While fans were not al­lowed into the sta­di­ums for the re­turn of Sin­ga­pore’s only pro­fes­sional sports league, it was far from quiet as Tampines Rovers hosted Hougang United af­ter Covid-19 forced the league to be sus­pended in March.</p>
    <p>A hand­ful of fans from Tampines and Hougang as well as pock­ets of cu­ri­ous spec­ta­tors stood at var­i­ous van­tage points – such as the fifth­floor jog­ging track and the li­brary on the sec­ond storey – within the in­te­grated com­mu­nity and life­style hub to watch the game, though some were seen not ob­serv­ing safe dis­tanc­ing prac­tices.</p>
    <p>With the SPL the first sports league to restart here, strict pro­to­cols were in place to en­sure the safety of all in­volved.</p>
    <p>Teams were con­fined to their re­spec­tive chang­ing rooms af­ter re­port­ing two hours be­fore kick­off, and both sets of play­ers made stag­gered en­trances and ex­its onto the pitch with no hand­shakes al­lowed. Substitute­s did not sit in the dugout but in the stands and there was no sta­dium an­nouncer or ball boys.</p>
    <p>All 223 lo­cal-based play­ers and match of­fi­cials tested neg­a­tive for Covid-19 on Oct 4 and swab tests will be con­ducted ev­ery two weeks.</p>
    <p>The num­ber of sub­sti­tu­tions for teams has been in­creased from three to five, a max­i­mum of three sub­sti­tu­tion win­dows al­lowed dur­ing the first and sec­ond halves, and manda­tory wa­ter breaks in­tro­duced in all matches.</p>
    <p>Mr Edwin Tong, Min­is­ter for Cul­ture, Com­mu­nity and Youth, was an ob­server at the game and felt the mea­sures were suf­fi­cient and well-fol­lowed. Also present were Sport Sin­ga­pore chief ex­ec­u­tive of­fi­cer Lim Teck Yin and Foot­ball As­so­ci­a­tion of Sin­ga­pore pres­i­dent Lim Kia Tong.</p>
    <p>Mr Tong said: “In­di­vid­ual dis­ci­pline is cru­cial, and ev­ery player, of­fi­cial and ground staff needs to be con­scious of safe dis­tanc­ing and per­sonal hy­giene. This would give us con­fi­dence to see it through to the end of the sea­son.”</p>
    <p>The re­turn of foot­ball ac­tion was com­pet­i­tive and in­trigu­ing as Hougang ended a 10-game win­less streak against Tampines since 2016 to win 2-1. De­spite the de­feat, Tampines re­main top with nine points from five games, while Hougang are up to third, two points back but with a game in hand.</p>
    <p>The Stags en­tered the game as favourites af­ter beat­ing Balestier Khalsa, Tan­jong Pa­gar United and big-money Lion City Sailors be­fore the break, but were miss­ing at­tacker Zehrudin Mehme­dovic</p>
    <p>through sus­pected dengue fever.</p>
    <p>De­spite be­ing out of com­pet­i­tive ac­tion for over six months, the teams held up well with passes and touches be­com­ing sloppy only in the last 10 min­utes, as Hougang mid­fielder Charlie Machell was the first to suc­cumb to cramps in the 83rd minute.</p>
    <p>While the vis­i­tors made use of all five sub­sti­tu­tions, Tampines coach Gavin Lee made just three subs and watched in de­spair as his side missed two gilt-edged op­por­tu­ni­ties to score in added time.</p>
    <p>Lee said: “I’m dis­ap­pointed with the re­sult but not with the fit­ness lev­els and ef­forts of the play­ers. Even at the end, we were fo­cused not on the score but on cre­at­ing op­por­tu­ni­ties. We did that, but just could not fin­ish.”</p>
    <p>Hougang coach Cle­ment Teo added: “With­out a proper pre­sea­son, I ex­pected in­juries. But this is where depth and ro­ta­tion comes in, and we have the ca­pa­bil­i­ties to</p>
    <p>deal with that.”</p>
    <p>Hougang de­fender Lionel Tan ac­knowl­edged the phys­i­cal and men­tal ex­er­tions of play­ing a first com­pet­i­tive match in more than six months. The 23-year-old said: “We didn’t play any friendlies be­fore restart­ing so we are def­i­nitely not in tip-top con­di­tion.</p>
    <p>“The in­tro­duc­tion of two wa­ter breaks in the mid­dle of each half is good for us to quench our thirst and curb our urge to spit. I felt the setup to­day was per­fect and there was no dis­rup­tion. The fans turn­ing up was a bonus and as long as they ob­serve safe dis­tanc­ing mea­sures, we re­ally ap­pre­ci­ate their sup­port.”</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day’s other SPL match also went on with­out a hitch as Balestier Khalsa beat Tan­jong Pa­gar United 1-0 in Jurong to climb to sec­ond on eight points, while the Jaguars re­main sev­enth with two points.</p>
