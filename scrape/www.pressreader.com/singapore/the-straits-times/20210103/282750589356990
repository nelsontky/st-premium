    <p>LOS AN­GE­LES • Luka Don­cic scored 27 points to out­duel fel­low Slove­nian Go­ran Dragic, as the Dal­las Mav­er­icks took ad­van­tage of some woe­ful three-point shoot­ing by Mi­ami to beat the Heat 93-83 in the Na­tional Bas­ket­ball As­so­ci­a­tion (NBA) on Fri­day night.</p>
    <p>Don­cic also tal­lied 15 re­bounds, out­per­form­ing Dragic, who fin­ished with 10 points and seven as­sists at Amer­i­can Air­lines Cen­tre arena in Dal­las, Texas.</p>
    <p>This was the first time in three ca­reer meet­ings that Don­cic had won against guard Dragic, as Dal­las snapped a six-game los­ing skid to Mi­ami.</p>
    <p>Dal­las coach Rick Carlisle said Don­cic is be­gin­ning to get into game shape.</p>
    <p>“Luka’s go­ing to get there,” he said. “He’s bust­ing his tail. He’s work­ing hard. Every­thing for him now is trend­ing in a good di­rec­tion con­di­tion­ing wise.”</p>
    <p>In what ap­pears to be a grow­ing trend in the NBA this sea­son, Mi­ami were un­done by poor shoot­ing from three-point range.</p>
    <p>On Thurs­day, the New York Knicks shot three for 36 from be­yond the arc in a 100-83 loss to the Toronto Rap­tors.</p>
    <p>Mi­ami missed their first 14 three­p­oint at­tempts, mak­ing a to­tal of just seven of 33. The Heat did not hit their first three-pointer un­til the third quar­ter when Dun­can Robin­son fi­nally sank one.</p>
    <p>Dal­las were 12 of 37 on three­p­oint at­tempts.</p>
    <p>Heat star Jimmy But­ler, who re­turned af­ter miss­ing two games with a sprained right an­kle, had just two points, three re­bounds and two as­sists in 27 min­utes.</p>
    <p>Mi­ami’s Bam Ade­bayo pro­duced his se­cond straight dou­ble-dou­ble with 19 points and 11 re­bounds. He also had a game-high four steals.</p>
    <p>Tim Har­d­away scored 18 points for Dal­las, and ex-Heat play­ers Josh Richard­son (11 points) and James John­son (eight points) also con­trib­uted. Dorian Fin­ney-Smith scored 12 points.</p>
    <p>Else­where, De’An­dre Hunter scored 23 points, and Trae Young chipped in 21 as the At­lanta Hawks bounced back from giv­ing up 145 points in their last game to beat the cold-shoot­ing Brook­lyn Nets 114-96 in New York.</p>
    <p>The win comes two nights af­ter At­lanta lost one of the high­est scor­ing games in re­cent NBA mem­ory, a 145-141 de­feat by the same Nets. The Hawks also snapped a sixgame los­ing skid to Brook­lyn.</p>
    <p>At­lanta drained 16 of 39 three­p­oint­ers, while the Nets hit just seven of 37 three-point at­tempts as they lost for the third time in four games. They got off to a roar­ing start with im­pres­sive vic­to­ries over Bos­ton and Golden State be­fore this lat­est wob­ble.</p>
    <p>Kevin Du­rant paced the Nets with 28 points on 10-of-21 shoot­ing, while start­ing point guard Kyrie Irv­ing strug­gled by mak­ing just eight of 32 shots from the field.</p>
    <p>“We were scram­bling,” said Joe Har­ris, who scored 12 points for the Nets. “We know what we have to clean up.”</p>
