    <p>A worka­tion is the kind of thing I would usu­ally be scep­ti­cal about. To me, ho­tels are ei­ther for high­end lux­ury and re­lax­ation or just places to crash if I am on a bud­get va­ca­tion.</p>
    <p>But with the drilling and knock­ing in the flat above mine go­ing on for the third week, I jump at the chance to work from Ho­tel G Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>With its bou­tique-in­spired con­cept and com­pact rooms, this ho­tel in Bugis is not the place for bub­ble baths and pool­side loung­ing.</p>
    <p>But it does have a strong Wi-Fi con­nec­tion, plenty of food and much-needed quiet – what I need to work.</p>
    <p>I am put up in a Great Room – one of four room types the ho­tel of­fers. The Hus­tle & Grind worka­tion pack­age al­lows me to check in from 7am – per­fect for early birds.</p>
    <p>My job does not re­quire me to start that early. I check in close to noon – after a press con­fer­ence at 10am.</p>
    <p>The room and its bath­room (the sink is out­side) are small, but func­tional.</p>
    <p>The queen-sized bed touches three walls. The mini fridge in the cor­ner is filled with com­pli­men­tary drinks – bot­tles of ap­ple juice, orange juice, milk, wa­ter, and a few cans of soda.</p>
    <p>I eye the Ne­spresso ma­chine on the desk next to the bed, but my cuppa will have to wait.</p>
    <p>Very soon, I have a vir­tual round­table in­ter­view with the di­rec­tor of a new South Korean tele­vi­sion se­ries and I have to get ready.</p>
    <p>It goes with­out a hitch. The Wi-Fi is re­li­able and the sur­round­ings are silent.</p>
    <p>Through­out my stay, I do not hear a squeak from the other rooms – what a respite from the ren­o­va­tion din at home.</p>
    <p>There is, how­ever, only one power out­let at the desk. For those who have to work with more than one de­vice, that may be an is­sue.</p>
    <p>What about the food of­fer­ings that come with the pack­age?</p>
    <p>De­spite my “late” check-in, I still re­ceive a morn­ing snack box of mini crois­sants and Dan­ish pas­tries, which is usu­ally sent to the room at around 9am.</p>
    <p>For lunch, I head to Ginett, the in-house restau­rant. It takes some time for some­one to no­tice me at the door, but once I am seated, the ser­vice is at­ten­tive even with a lunch crowd.</p>
    <p>I or­der the set lunch, which of­fers a main with a starter or a dessert. Although Ginett has an ex­pan­sive menu, its set lunch op­tions are lim­ited – only two choices each for the starter and the main, and you can­not pick the dessert. I use one of my two wine coupons for a com­pli­men­tary glass of white.</p>
    <p>Back in my room, an­other snack box ar­rives at around 4pm. This time, I get a savoury piece of toast and mini muffins.</p>
    <p>I am plied with so much food that I ask for bags to bring the left­overs home.</p>
    <p>Be­tween 7am and 7pm, only the guest who books the pack­age is al­lowed in the room. After 7pm, an­other guest is al­lowed to stay over, and both can have the ho­tel’s com­pli­men­tary break­fast the next morn­ing.</p>
    <p>My plus-one is my mother, who never says no to a ho­tel break­fast. She en­joys the con­gee.</p>
    <p>Ho­tel G is ex­actly what I look for in a worka­tion.</p>
    <p>No bells and whis­tles, just a com­fort­able room with strong Wi-Fi, plenty of com­pli­men­tary snacks and some peace and quiet away from the fam­ily and my neigh­bour’s end­less ren­o­va­tion works while I hus­tle and grind.</p>
