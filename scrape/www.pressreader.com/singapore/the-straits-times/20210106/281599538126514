    <p>Elec­tric­ity de­mand here is ex­pected to have fallen be­tween 2 per cent and 4 per cent last year due to the pan­demic, but it is ex­pected to re­bound as the econ­omy re­cov­ers and grows. Sin­ga­pore wants to green its en­ergy mix as this hap­pens, said Dr Tan See Leng, Sec­ond Min­is­ter for Trade and In­dus­try, in Par­lia­ment yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Elec­tric­ity de­mand in Sin­ga­pore is ex­pected to have fallen by be­tween 2 per cent and 4 per cent last year due to the Covid-19 pan­demic, but is pro­jected to re­bound as the econ­omy re­cov­ers and grows.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore wants to green its en­ergy mix as this hap­pens, but is also tak­ing steps to en­sure elec­tric­ity sup­ply re­mains sta­ble and re­li­able, said Dr Tan See Leng, Sec­ond Min­is­ter for Trade and In­dus­try, in Par­lia­ment yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>“We will har­ness four switches to trans­form and di­ver­sify our en­ergy sup­ply, so as to achieve our vi­sion of a clean and ef­fi­cient en­ergy fu­ture,” he said in re­sponse to four MPs who had asked about Sin­ga­pore’s plans to tap re­new­able en­ergy and im­port elec­tric­ity.</p>
    <p>Cur­rently, 95 per cent of Sin­ga­pore’s elec­tric­ity is gen­er­ated from burn­ing nat­u­ral gas, the clean­est fos­sil fuel. Dr Tan said this fuel will con­tinue to be the main source of en­ergy in the medium term, given that the Re­pub­lic does not have ac­cess to other re­new­able en­ergy sources, such as hy­dro or wind power.</p>
    <p>But the coun­try is tak­ing steps to in­crease the pro­por­tion of re­new­ables in its en­ergy mix in the longer term, he said.</p>
    <p>For one thing, it will in­crease the amount of sun­shine it har­nesses.</p>
    <p>Dr Tan said so­lar en­ergy is the most vi­able source of re­new­able en­ergy in Sin­ga­pore, and pointed to how in­stalled so­lar ca­pac­ity has in­creased more than a hun­dred­fold over the past decade, from 3.8 megawatt-peak in 2010, to around 400 megawatt-peak in mid-2020.</p>
    <p>“We are ac­cel­er­at­ing our ef­forts and we will al­most quadru­ple our so­lar ca­pac­ity to 1.5 gi­gawatt-peak by 2025, and to 2 gi­gawatt-peak by 2030,” he said.</p>
    <p>Cur­rently, less than 1 per cent of Sin­ga­pore’s elec­tric­ity is gen­er­ated by so­lar pan­els. But by 2030, Dr Tan said, so­lar en­ergy could sup­ply around 3 per cent of the coun­try’s to­tal elec­tric­ity con­sump­tion.</p>
    <p>An­other op­tion is to tap re­gional power grids.</p>
    <p>Last Oc­to­ber, Min­is­ter for Trade and In­dus­try Chan Chun Sing an­nounced that Sin­ga­pore will be im­port­ing 100MW of elec­tric­ity from Malaysia over a trial pe­riod of two years. This makes up about 1.5 per cent of Sin­ga­pore’s peak elec­tric­ity de­mand. Dr Tan said Sin­ga­pore prefers to im­port elec­tric­ity from re­new­able en­ergy sources.</p>
    <p>In re­sponse to Mr Sak­tiandi Su­paat (Bis­han-Toa Payoh GRC), who asked for an up­date on so­lar firm Sun Ca­ble’s plan to sup­ply so­lar power from northern Aus­tralia to Sin­ga­pore via the world’s long­est sub­sea high-volt­age ca­ble, Dr Tan said dis­cus­sions are on­go­ing and that the En­ergy Mar­ket Au­thor­ity un­der his min­istry is un­able to share de­tails due to com­mer­cial sen­si­tiv­i­ties.</p>
    <p>But he added: “While we wel­come these in­ter­ests, we have to pace these im­ports to en­sure that they do not un­der­mine the re­li­a­bil­ity of our elec­tric­ity sup­ply and the sta­bil­ity of our elec­tric­ity mar­ket.”</p>
    <p>Dr Tan said Sin­ga­pore is also look­ing to sci­ence and tech­nol­ogy to make elec­tric­ity gen­er­a­tion greener. “We are work­ing with the in­dus­try and re­search com­mu­nity to study emerg­ing low-car­bon tech­nolo­gies, such as hy­dro­gen and car­bon cap­ture, util­i­sa­tion and stor­age,” he said, point­ing to the new $49 mil­lion Low­Car­bon En­ergy Re­search Fund­ing Ini­tia­tive.</p>
    <p>This fund­ing ini­tia­tive, an­nounced last Oc­to­ber, will ex­plore ar­eas such as the sup­ply, stor­age and down­stream uses of hy­dro­gen – which has the po­ten­tial to be an en­vi­ron­men­tal­lyfriendly fuel since it pro­duces no emis­sions when burned – as well as car­bon cap­ture and stor­age for use in build­ing ma­te­ri­als or fu­els, he said.</p>
    <p>Asked by Ms Ch­eryl Chan (East Coast GRC) how Sin­ga­pore could sooner achieve its de­car­bon­i­sa­tion goal, Dr Tan said the coun­try is also look­ing to de­velop some form of a car­bon trad­ing plat­form.</p>
    <p>“(This will help us) lever­age the mul­ti­ple ini­tia­tives that are avail­able to help us re­duce our car­bon foot­print,” he said.</p>
    <p>SEEK­ING GREENER PATH</p>
    <p>We are work­ing with the in­dus­try and re­search com­mu­nity to study emerg­ing low-car­bon tech­nolo­gies, such as hy­dro­gen and car­bon cap­ture, util­i­sa­tion and stor­age. ’’</p>
