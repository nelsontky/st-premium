    <p>Laid low by the coro­n­avirus pan­demic, air­lines will be the work­horses of the at­tempt to erad­i­cate it, haul­ing bil­lions of vac­cine</p>
    <p>vials to ev­ery cor­ner of the globe. It is an un­prece­dented task, made more dif­fi­cult by car­ri­ers’ di­min­ished state af­ter culling jobs, routes and air­craft to sur­vive a cri­sis that has re­duced air traf­fic glob­ally by an es­ti­mated 61 per cent this year.</p>
    <p>FRANK­FURT • In cooled ware­houses on the fringes of Frank­furt air­port, Deutsche Lufthansa is pre­par­ing its de­pleted fleet for the gar­gan­tuan task of air­lift­ing mil­lions of doses of the vac­cines meant to end the coro­n­avirus pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Lufthansa, one of the world’s big­gest cargo car­ri­ers, be­gan plan­ning in April in an­tic­i­pa­tion of the shots that drug­mak­ers from Pfizer to Moderna and As­traZeneca are de­vel­op­ing in record time.</p>
    <p>A 20-mem­ber task force is de­vis­ing ways to fit more of the cru­cial pay­load onto the air­line’s 15 Boe­ing 777 and MD-11 freighters, along with hold space in a pas­sen­ger fleet now fly­ing at just 25 per cent of ca­pac­ity. “The ques­tion is how we scale it up,” said Mr Thorsten Braun, who leads Lufthansa’s part in the global ef­fort.</p>
    <p>Laid low by a Covid-19 out­break that has dec­i­mated pas­sen­ger de­mand, air­lines will be the work­horses of the at­tempt to erad­i­cate it, haul­ing bil­lions of vials to ev­ery cor­ner of the globe.</p>
    <p>“This will be the largest and most com­plex lo­gis­ti­cal ex­er­cise ever,” said Mr Alexandre de Ju­niac, CEO of the In­ter­na­tional Air Trans­port As­so­ci­a­tion (Iata). It es­ti­mates that the equiv­a­lent of 8,000 loads in a 110-tonne ca­pac­ity Boe­ing 747 freighter will be needed for the air­lift, which will take two years to sup­ply some 14 bil­lion doses.</p>
    <p>Here are some of the big­gest chal­lenges along the way:</p>
    <p>CARGO CA­PAC­ITY</p>
    <p>Air­lines have drafted about 2,500 pas­sen­ger planes into cargo-only roles, but dis­tribut­ing the vac­cine would be eas­ier if fleets were fly­ing with usual fre­quen­cies to their usual des­ti­na­tions.</p>
    <p>Pfizer plans to ship 1.3 bil­lion doses of its vac­cine by the end of next year. Moderna is pro­duc­ing about 500 mil­lion doses. As­traZeneca has man­u­fac­tur­ing ca­pac­ity for 2 bil­lion doses.</p>
    <p>To al­low more pas­sen­ger jets to be brought back into ser­vice, gov­ern­ments should open up travel, said Mr Glyn Hughes, Iata’s global head of cargo.</p>
    <p>DEEP FREEZE</p>
    <p>The Pfizer-BioNTech vac­cine adds an ex­tra layer of dif­fi­culty. It must be trans­ported at mi­nus 70 deg C.</p>
    <p>Upon ar­rival, the vac­cine can be stored in ul­tra-low tem­per­a­ture freez­ers, or in a fridge in a hos­pi­tal for five days at 2-to-8 deg C, or in a spe­cial Pfizer ther­mal ship­per, in which the doses will ar­rive. That can be used as a tem­po­rary stor­age unit by re­fill­ing with dry ice for up to 15 days. Once thawed, the vials can­not be re-frozen.</p>
    <p>The chore­og­ra­phy will be ex­tremely del­i­cate, with con­trols in place from fac­tory to clinic and all points in be­tween.</p>
    <p>STOR­AGE</p>
    <p>De­spite the hur­dles, a well-es­tab­lished global net­work for phar­ma­ceu­ti­cal distri­bu­tion should ex­pe­dite the flow of doses. Cities rang­ing from Mi­ami, Dal­las and Lon­don, to Liege in Bel­gium, Dubai, Mum­bai, Sin­ga­pore and In­cheon in Seoul have well-es­tab­lished deep-freeze ca­pa­bil­i­ties.</p>
    <p>De­liv­ery firms have ex­pe­ri­ence trans­port­ing flu vac­cines and med­i­cal sam­ples at low tem­per­a­tures.</p>
    <p>REACH­ING THE POOR</p>
    <p>United Na­tions hu­man­i­tar­ian re­lief agency Unicef has been re­cruit­ing air­lines to dis­trib­ute the vac­cine to more than 170 coun­tries.</p>
    <p>The chal­lenge is steep in emerg­ing na­tions, where trans­port to re­mote ar­eas may be rick­ety and un­re­li­able, or even non-ex­is­tent.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore, a close neigh­bour to some of Asia’s poor­est na­tions, should be able to tar­get a dis­pro­por­tion­ate share of the tran­sit, ac­cord­ing to Mr Alex Hun­gate, chief ex­ec­u­tive of­fi­cer of ground-han­dling gi­ant SATS.</p>
    <p>THE LAST MILE</p>
    <p>De­liv­ery will in­volve more than air­planes. Cars, buses, trucks – even mo­tor­cy­cles, bi­cy­cles and don­keys – may be re­quired to get the vac­cine to ru­ral ar­eas. In some places, it may need to be car­ried in by foot. “You just don’t have deep-freez­ers ev­ery­where,” said Mr Adar Poon­awalla, chief ex­ec­u­tive of­fi­cer of Serum In­sti­tute of In­dia, the world’s big­gest vac­cine maker.</p>
    <p>The pos­si­bil­ity of tam­per­ing, pro­duc­tion of coun­ter­feit shots and at­tempts to dis­rupt distri­bu­tion are also a con­cern, ac­cord­ing to Iata.</p>
    <p>Mr de Ju­niac in­sists that the in­dus­try is ready. “We will not dis­ap­point,” he said.</p>
    <p>MOST COM­PLEX</p>
    <p>This will be the largest and most com­plex lo­gis­ti­cal ex­er­cise ever.</p>
    <p>MR ALEXANDRE DE JU­NIAC, chief ex­ec­u­tive of­fi­cer of the In­ter­na­tional Air Trans­port As­so­ci­a­tion.</p>
    <p>With Covid-19 flar­ing up again in many coun­tries, and safe, ef­fec­tive vac­cines likely to be­come avail­able over the next few months, how do we de­ploy them wisely and well?</p>
    <p>Glob­ally, the Covid-19 Vac­cine Global Ac­cess (Covax) Fa­cil­ity is work­ing on vac­cine ac­cess for all who need it, in­clud­ing low- and medium-in­come coun­tries. This in­ter­na­tional col­lab­o­ra­tion aims to en­able eq­ui­table distri­bu­tion of Covid-19 vac­cines through global risk-shar­ing and pooled pro­cure­ment strate­gies.</p>
    <p>Al­though there are over 70 vac­cines cur­rently in hu­man tri­als, the his­tory of vac­cine de­vel­op­ment is fraught with can­di­dates that per­form well in phase one and two stud­ies, but stum­ble at phase three, the fi­nal stage prior to reg­u­la­tory ap­proval.</p>
    <p>Risk-shar­ing and pooled pro­cure­ment pro­tect coun­tries from back­ing the wrong horse and wind­ing up empty-handed with no vac­cines for their peo­ple, and al­low poorer coun­tries a chance to get ac­cess to vac­cines.</p>
    <p>SAFETY AND EF­FI­CACY</p>
    <p>Each coun­try will have its own con­sid­er­a­tions re­gard­ing when and how to vac­ci­nate its pop­u­la­tion based upon its cir­cum­stances. So, when should Covid-19 vac­cines be used within Sin­ga­pore, and how should we pri­ori­tise who gets the vac­cines first when they be­come avail­able here?</p>
    <p>Safety and ef­fi­cacy are our high­est pri­or­i­ties, so Covid-19 vac­cines should be rec­om­mended for use only af­ter they have passed rig­or­ous scru­tiny by the health au­thor­i­ties and med­i­cal ex­perts. This re­quires that the risk-ben­e­fit be favourable.</p>
    <p>The goals of vac­ci­na­tion are to pro­tect peo­ple from Covid-19 in­fec­tions and its se­vere com­pli­ca­tions, to pro­tect our com­mu­ni­ties from the pub­lic health im­pact of out­breaks, and to fa­cil­i­tate the safe re­open­ing of our econ­omy, so­ci­ety and borders.</p>
    <p>The high­est pri­or­ity would gen­er­ally be to pro­tect health­care staff and front-line work­ers, a sen­si­ble ob­jec­tive as it en­sures that we can keep our es­sen­tial op­er­a­tions func­tion­ing. Th­ese goals shape the for­mu­la­tion of our Covid-19 vac­ci­na­tion strat­egy: who should be vac­ci­nated, when vac­ci­na­tion should oc­cur and how vac­cines are ad­min­is­tered.</p>
    <p>Ini­tial sup­plies of Covid-19 vac­cines will be lim­ited be­cause of strong global de­mand and ur­gent needs in coun­tries fac­ing Covid-19 surges. As vac­cine pro­duc­tion ramps up world­wide, and other vac­cine can­di­dates com­plete phase three tri­als suc­cess­fully, vac­cine sup­plies should even­tu­ally be suf­fi­cient for ev­ery­one liv­ing in Sin­ga­pore to get vac­ci­nated.</p>
    <p>To this end, the World Health Or­gan­i­sa­tion and other coun­tries have ar­tic­u­lated frame­works for which groups should get pri­or­ity ac­cess to vac­cines. Our prioritisa­tion frame­work should be con­sis­tent with pub­lished in­ter­na­tional plans, as it is sim­i­larly an­chored on two ma­jor di­men­sions of risk: the risk of get­ting in­fected with Covid-19, and the risk of se­vere com­pli­ca­tions or death from the virus.</p>
    <p>Since health­care staff and es­sen­tial front-line work­ers have high risk ex­po­sure, giv­ing them pri­or­ity con­serves our health­care and es­sen­tial ser­vices ca­pac­ity. We know as well which seg­ments of our com­mu­nity are at high­est risk of se­ri­ous in­fec­tion, mak­ing them the most vul­ner­a­ble, should they get in­fected.</p>
    <p>There­fore, such vul­ner­a­ble in­di­vid­u­als, es­pe­cially older adults and per­sons with med­i­cal con­di­tions, should also be given pri­or­ity as vac­cine sup­plies be­come avail­able. Our ul­ti­mate goal should be to en­able ev­ery­one re­sid­ing in Sin­ga­pore to have the op­por­tu­nity for vac­ci­na­tion.</p>
    <p>With the pan­demic rag­ing around the world, we are likely to be able to an­a­lyse Covid-19 vac­cine data for their ef­fi­cacy and safety in spe­cific seg­ments of the pop­u­la­tion which are less well stud­ied, par­tic­u­larly chil­dren and preg­nant women.</p>
    <p>While such data may take time to ac­crue, the large num­ber of Covid-19 cases glob­ally will likely give us much-needed data more quickly than in the case of other vac­cines. Of note, vac­cine man­u­fac­tur­ers have made ef­forts to broaden the di­ver­sity of par­tic­i­pants in re­search tri­als, specif­i­cally dif­fer­ent eth­nic­i­ties and older adults.</p>
    <p>To date, early data has in­di­cated that vac­cine ef­fi­cacy is high in adults over the age of 65, and that this seems con­sis­tent across age, gen­der and eth­nic­ity.</p>
    <p>MAN­AG­ING THE VAC­CI­NA­TION PROCESS</p>
    <p>As we will be aim­ing to vac­ci­nate large num­bers of Sin­ga­pore­ans over a rel­a­tively short space of time, man­ag­ing the process will be a chal­lenge.</p>
    <p>Some of the is­sues that will be ac­tively worked on in­clude track­ing who has been vac­ci­nated, man­ag­ing the cold chain be­cause the mRNA Covid-19 vac­cines will re­quire stor­age at low tem­per­a­tures of up to mi­nus 70 deg C (colder than Antarc­tica!), and or­gan­is­ing the flow of peo­ple com­ing for vac­ci­na­tion.</p>
    <p>We will also need to be able to mon­i­tor vac­ci­nated peo­ple for side ef­fects pos­si­bly linked to the vac­cine, and de­velop a process to as­sist the very few who do ex­pe­ri­ence rare vac­cine side ef­fects.</p>
    <p>There are some im­por­tant un­knowns that re­main with vac­ci­na­tion. The first is how long im­mu­nity lasts af­ter vac­ci­na­tion or in­fec­tion. We re­fer to this as the dura­bil­ity of im­mu­nity. We al­ready know that some re­cov­ered cases can have a per­sis­tent pos­i­tive test for a while, but th­ese are gen­er­ally not con­sid­ered re­in­fec­tions. So far, we have not been able to cul­ture live virus from such in­di­vid­u­als lo­cally.</p>
    <p>Rare, true re­in­fec­tions have been re­ported. But we should also see this in light of the fact that over 63 mil­lion have been in­fected, 43 mil­lion have re­cov­ered, and many coun­tries are ex­pe­ri­enc­ing re­peated waves of Covid-19 trans­mis­sion. There­fore, if re­in­fec­tions were truly com­mon, we would ex­pect to have seen more cases by now.</p>
    <p>While only time will tell re­gard­ing the dura­bil­ity of im­mu­nity af­ter a Covid-19 vac­ci­na­tion, it is at least as good as the im­mu­nity fol­low­ing in­fec­tion by the virus. More­over, decades of ex­pe­ri­ence with other vac­cines tell us that some vac­cines pro­vide long-last­ing pro­tec­tion such as hepati­tis A or po­lio, and others re­quire boost­ers such as tetanus or per­tus­sis.</p>
    <p>The se­cond un­known that we will gain knowl­edge about only with time is whether vac­ci­nated per­sons can still trans­mit Covid-19 to others should they get in­fected and de­velop a mild ill­ness.</p>
    <p>In other words, apart from pro­tec­tive im­mu­nity that shields the in­di­vid­ual from get­ting a symp­to­matic dis­ease, is there ster­il­is­ing im­mu­nity that pre­vents the in­di­vid­ual from be­com­ing in­fected at all and, there­fore, un­able to trans­mit the virus? Be­cause we can­not guar­an­tee this, we will still need to adopt safe dis­tanc­ing mea­sures. We will still need masks, main­tain our abil­ity to de­tect cases early, and man­age their care safely.</p>
    <p>But we have now gained a very pow­er­ful ca­pa­bil­ity. Apart from min­imis­ing se­vere in­fec­tions, if vac­cines can help us re­duce the ac­tual re­pro­duc­tive num­ber for in­fec­tion to fewer than one, out­breaks will fiz­zle out.</p>
    <p>Here, we need only look to the ex­am­ple of measles, which has an in­trin­sic re­pro­duc­tive num­ber of 15, among the high­est of any in­fec­tious dis­ease. This means one measles case in a to­tally sus­cep­ti­ble pop­u­la­tion can in­fect 15 per­sons, and each of those sec­ondary cases could in­fect a fur­ther 15 cases each, so that within two trans­mis­sion cy­cles, one case could re­sult in 225 cases.</p>
    <p>For cen­turies, we were com­pletely help­less against this virus, with thou­sands of chil­dren world­wide dy­ing or go­ing blind from measles com­pli­ca­tions ev­ery year. In 1984, the year be­fore measles vac­ci­na­tion be­came manda­tory in Sin­ga­pore, there were 2,417 cases with seven deaths from measles here. Vac­ci­na­tion al­lowed us to even­tu­ally con­trol measles out­breaks, and Sin­ga­pore fi­nally achieved measles elim­i­na­tion in 2018. This does not mean that there are no measles cases in Sin­ga­pore, but rather, that there are no large out­breaks, nor mul­ti­ple chains of trans­mis­sions.</p>
    <p>VAC­CINE HES­I­TANCY</p>
    <p>It is un­der­stand­able that there may be some vac­cine hes­i­tancy. One must ac­knowl­edge that there are some valid con­cerns, set­ting aside the wildly un­sci­en­tific claims be­ing made by anti-vac­cine move­ments.</p>
    <p>But we need to also ap­pre­ci­ate why there is a press­ing need for mass vac­ci­na­tion. Con­sider th­ese fig­ures – de­spite over 63 mil­lion in­fected glob­ally, and more than 1.4 mil­lion dead from Covid-19 over a mere 11 months, stud­ies us­ing blood tests for Covid-19 an­ti­bod­ies in­di­cate that less than 10 per cent of the pop­u­la­tion got in­fected, even in the hard­est-hit coun­tries in the first wave. That trans­lates to at least 90 per cent of the pop­u­la­tion still at risk for catch­ing Covid-19.</p>
    <p>To achieve herd im­mu­nity, at least 60 per cent to 70 per cent of the pop­u­la­tion would have to get in­fected. If even the wealth­i­est na­tions of the world have ex­pe­ri­enced se­ri­ous im­pact with only 5 per cent to 10 per cent of their pop­u­la­tion in­fected, con­sider the dev­as­ta­tion and the cost in terms of hu­man suf­fer­ing which would oc­cur by al­low­ing the virus to burn unchecked through the pop­u­la­tion.</p>
    <p>Vac­ci­na­tion pro­vides a dif­fer­ent path for­ward for hu­man­ity. But for it to suc­ceed, we need the courage to step out, to en­able Covid-19 vac­ci­na­tion for all who need it, and to en­gage pa­tiently those who hes­i­tate, ad­dress­ing their rea­son­able con­cerns.</p>
    <p>The world will con­tinue to be at risk of Covid-19 resur­gences, as long as the virus smoul­ders in any coun­try. As our econ­omy, so­ci­ety and borders are care­fully re­opened, vac­ci­na­tion serves as a pro­tec­tive buf­fer for our pop­u­la­tion.</p>
    <p>If enough of our peo­ple are vac­ci­nated, im­ported in­fec­tions from vis­i­tors and re­turn­ing trav­ellers will be less likely to spark new Covid-19 out­breaks or cause se­ri­ous ill­ness. Through vac­ci­na­tion, we can min­imise the risk of ex­plo­sive spread in group set­tings.</p>
    <p>Vac­cines have proved suc­cess­ful in fight­ing other in­fec­tious scourges in hu­man his­tory. Along with other mea­sures, Covid-19 vac­cines pro­vide hope that we will now have a pow­er­ful tool to fa­cil­i­tate re­cov­ery from the tremen­dous dis­rup­tions of this pan­demic.</p>
