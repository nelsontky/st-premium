    <p>JERUSALEM An Is­raeli of­fi­cial yes­ter­day dis­missed as “non­sense” an al­le­ga­tion by the Ira­nian For­eign Min­is­ter that Is­rael was try­ing to trick the United States into wag­ing war on Iran.</p>
    <p>It was Is­rael that needed to be on alert for pos­si­ble Ira­nian strikes on the one-year an­niver­sary yes­ter­day of the as­sas­si­na­tion of Te­heran’s top gen­eral Qassem Soleimani in a US drone strike in</p>
    <p>Iraq, En­ergy Min­is­ter Yu­val Steinitz said on Kan pub­lic ra­dio.</p>
    <p>Wash­ing­ton blames Iran-backed mili­tia for reg­u­lar rocket at­tacks on US fa­cil­i­ties in Iraq, in­clud­ing near the US em­bassy. No known Iran-backed groups have claimed re­spon­si­bil­ity.</p>
    <p>Ira­nian For­eign Min­is­ter Mo­ham­mad Javad Zarif tweeted on Satur­day: “New in­tel­li­gence from Iraq in­di­cates that Is­raeli agent-provo­ca­teurs are plot­ting at­tacks against Amer­i­cans – putting an out­go­ing (Pres­i­dent Don­ald) Trump in a bind with a fake ca­sus belli.”</p>
    <p>In what ap­peared to be a veiled threat against Is­rael, Mr Zarif wrote: “Be care­ful of a trap, @real Don­aldTrump. Any fire­works will back­fire badly, par­tic­u­larly against your same BFFs.”</p>
    <p>Mr Steinitz said the re­marks showed that Iran, af­ter mount­ing</p>
    <p>US sanc­tions billed as curb­ing its nu­clear pro­gramme and in­volve­ment in re­gional con­flict zones, was “un­der pres­sure – eco­nomic pres­sure, and pres­sure in terms of na­tional se­cu­rity”.</p>
    <p>“We hear this non­sense by Zarif, that Is­rael would set off ter­ror­ist at­tacks against the United States – this re­ally is to­tal non­sense,” Mr Steinitz told Kan pub­lic ra­dio.</p>
    <p>“But, on the other hand, it is a warning sign – a warning sign that Iran is tak­ing aim at Is­rael, is look­ing for ex­cuses to lash out at Is­rael, and there­fore, we need to have our fin­ger on the pulse and be at the high­est state of alert.”</p>
    <p>The US mil­i­tary flew two nu­clear-ca­pa­ble B-52 bombers to the Mid­dle East in a mes­sage of de­ter­rence to Iran last Wednesday, but the bombers have since left the re­gion.</p>
    <p>In a sep­a­rate in­ter­view with Kan, Is­raeli Cul­ture Min­is­ter Ye­hiel Moshe Trop­per, who like Mr Steinitz is in Prime Min­is­ter Ben­jamin Ne­tanyahu’s se­cu­rity Cab­i­net, con­firmed me­dia re­ports that Is­rael was on height­ened alert for the Soleimani an­niver­sary.</p>
    <p>Asked what pos­si­ble Ira­nian reprisals Is­rael was an­tic­i­pat­ing, Mr Trop­per said: “I can­not com­ment.”</p>
