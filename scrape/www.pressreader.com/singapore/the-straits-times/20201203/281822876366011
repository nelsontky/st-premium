    <p>Eng­land yes­ter­day ex­ited a strict month-long lock­down in favour of less strin­gent coro­n­avirus re­stric­tions af­ter Par­lia­ment ap­proved new rules de­spite a sub­stan­tial re­volt among law­mak­ers in Prime Min­is­ter Boris John­son’s Con­ser­va­tive Party.</p>
    <p>In­stead of a blan­ket ap­proach, a three-tier sys­tem of re­stric­tions will now be put into place that is aimed at putting a stop to surg­ing rates of in­fec­tion, eas­ing pres­sure on health ser­vices and al­low­ing fam­i­lies to gather for Christ­mas.</p>
    <p>But a re­bel­lion by law­mak­ers who want to go far­ther in eas­ing the lim­its on pub­lic life un­der­scored the rising tide of dis­con­tent among Mr John­son’s own mem­bers of Par­lia­ment over his han­dling of the pan­demic, ex­ac­er­bated by fears that the curbs could hurt the hos­pi­tal­ity in­dus­try.</p>
    <p>Un­der the new sys­tem, coro­n­avirus re­stric­tions will dif­fer from place to place, based on an as­sess­ment of the coro­n­avirus risks in each one.</p>
    <p>How­ever, most of Eng­land’s 55 mil­lion peo­ple will go straight into tier two or tier three, lim­it­ing house­hold mix­ing and the re­open­ing of the hos­pi­tal­ity sec­tor.</p>
    <p>Around 23 mil­lion peo­ple will be in the strictest tier three – where pubs and restau­rants will be shut ex­cept for take­out ser­vice, in­clud­ing in the city of Birm­ing­ham.</p>
    <p>Lon­don is in tier two, mean­ing pubs where food is served and restau­rants can re­open.</p>
    <p>Just 1 per cent of the coun­try – the south-west county of Corn­wall, the far-flung Isles of Scilly off its coast, and the Isle of Wight in the south – are at the less re­stric­tive tier one of re­stric­tions.</p>
    <p>Ahead of the vote, Mr John­son – a Covid-19 sur­vivor – told law­mak­ers: “All we need to do now is to hold our nerve un­til these vac­cines are in­deed in our grasp and be­ing in­jected into our arms.”</p>
    <p>Un­til then, “we can­not af­ford to re­lax, es­pe­cially dur­ing the cold months of win­ter”, he warned.</p>
    <p>The out­come of Tues­day’s vote, which Mr John­son won by 291-78, was never in doubt af­ter a de­ci­sion by the op­po­si­tion Labour Party to ab­stain.</p>
    <p>Pre­sented with a take-it-or­leave-it of­fer, Labour’s leader, Mr Keir Starmer, told his law­mak­ers not to vote, say­ing he did not want to stop the only set of re­stric­tions avail­able and there­fore would not vote against them.</p>
    <p>Yet the scale of the Con­ser­va­tive re­volt served a warn­ing to Mr John­son, dent­ing the au­thor­ity of a gov­ern­ment whose ma­jor­ity in Par­lia­ment looks less than solid only a year af­ter he won a land­slide elec­tion vic­tory. More than 50 of the 364 Con­ser­va­tive mem­bers of Par­lia­ment voted against the new mea­sures on Tues­day.</p>
    <p>Aside from those who ob­ject to the new rules on lib­er­tar­ian grounds, sev­eral Con­ser­va­tive law­mak­ers dis­puted de­ci­sions to place the ar­eas they rep­re­sent in tier three of the re­stric­tions, with the most strin­gent curbs.</p>
    <p>Start­ing yes­ter­day, there was some re­lax­ation from the lock­down across Eng­land, as all stores, gyms and hair­dressers were al­lowed to re­open.</p>
    <p>Re­li­gious ser­vices and wed­dings have been al­lowed to restart and lim­ited num­bers of spec­ta­tors are to be al­lowed at some out­door sport­ing events.</p>
    <p>The gov­ern­ments of Scot­land, Wales and North­ern Ire­land set their own coro­n­avirus rules.</p>
    <p>Bri­tain has recorded the high­est num­ber of fa­tal­i­ties in Europe in the pan­demic, with more than 59,000 deaths from some 1.65 mil­lion cases.</p>
