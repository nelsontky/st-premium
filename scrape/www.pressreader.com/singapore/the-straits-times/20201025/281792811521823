    <p>A dis­ci­plinary com­plaint against lawyer M. Ravi was filed with the Law So­ci­ety by the At­tor­ney-Gen­eral’s Cham­bers (AGC) last Fri­day.</p>
    <p>The com­plaint re­lates to “pos­si­ble pro­fes­sional mis­con­duct” by Mr Ravi, the AGC said in a state­ment last Fri­day evening.</p>
    <p>It was filed be­cause Mr Ravi had nei­ther apol­o­gised nor re­tracted state­ments he made ear­lier which the AGC had said were “false, mis­lead­ing, and un­fairly and il­le­git­i­mately dis­credit AGC”, the state­ment added.</p>
    <p>The AGC fur­ther said Mr Ravi’s con­duct “falls short of the stan­dards of pro­fes­sional con­duct to be ex­pected from an ad­vo­cate and so­lic­i­tor of the court”.</p>
    <p>Last Mon­day, Mr Ravi told al­ter­na­tive news web­site The On­line Ci­ti­zen that the pros­e­cu­tor had been “overzeal­ous” in prosecutin­g his client Gobi Ave­dian, and this “led to the death sen­tence” be­ing given to him by a High Court judge.</p>
    <p>Mr Ravi made the com­ments af­ter the five-judge Court of Ap­peal re­versed a 2018 de­ci­sion to con­vict Gobi on a cap­i­tal charge for drug traf­fick­ing.</p>
    <p>He also said, among other things, the apex court’s judg­ment calls into ques­tion “the fair­ness of the ad­min­is­tra­tion of jus­tice in Gobi’s case by the pros­e­cu­tion”.</p>
    <p>The AGC said in last Fri­day’s state­ment that in the in­ter­view, Mr Ravi made “se­ri­ous al­le­ga­tions in­sin­u­at­ing that the pub­lic pros­e­cu­tor had acted in bad faith or ma­li­ciously” in ap­peal­ing against Gobi’s orig­i­nal sen­tence of 15 years’ jail and 10 strokes of the cane, and that this “al­leged mis­con­duct led to the im­po­si­tion of the death sen­tence” on Gobi.</p>
    <p>The AGC also noted the Court of Ap­peal made “no such ad­verse find­ings against the pub­lic pros­e­cu­tor”.</p>
    <p>Last Tues­day, the AGC is­sued a let­ter to Mr Ravi de­mand­ing that he apol­o­gise for his com­ments and re­tract them un­con­di­tion­ally. He did not com­ply.</p>
    <p>A day later, he said the AGC’s de­mand for an apol­ogy was “plainly with­out ba­sis”, and sought an apol­ogy from the pub­lic pros­e­cu­tor to his client in­stead.</p>
    <p>In his let­ter to Deputy At­tor­neyGen­eral Hri Ku­mar Nair, he said he does not deny mak­ing the state­ments spec­i­fied in the AGC’s let­ter to him last Tues­day.</p>
    <p>But he de­nied the state­ments amounted to al­le­ga­tions that the pub­lic pros­e­cu­tor had acted in bad faith or ma­li­ciously in prosecutin­g Gobi, and that he had made the state­ments while know­ing or hav­ing rea­son to be­lieve that they were false.</p>
    <p>In a let­ter to Mr Ravi last Fri­day, Mr Nair wrote: “We re­ject the as­ser­tions in your re­sponse and will not be ac­ced­ing to any of your de­mands therein.”</p>
