    <p>WASH­ING­TON • Gold­man Sachs Malaysia, a unit of the in­vest­ment bank­ing group, yes­ter­day pleaded guilty to US Depart­ment of Jus­tice charges over its role in Malaysia’s 1MDB cor­rup­tion scandal, as it looks to set­tle a probe that has dogged the bank for years.</p>
    <p>In a court hear­ing, Gold­man Sachs said it would plead guilty to vi­o­lat­ing the anti-bribery pro­vi­sions of the For­eign Cor­rupt Prac­tices Act in re­la­tion to the scandal.</p>
    <p>Later in the day, Gold­man was ex­pected to agree to pay more than US$2 bil­lion (S$2.71 bil­lion) to set­tle the charges over its role in the scandal.</p>
    <p>Separately, Hong Kong’s mar­kets watch­dog yes­ter­day fined Gold­man Sachs’ Asian busi­ness US$350 mil­lion for its role in the 1MDB scandal, the largest sin­gle fine ever levied by the Hong Kong reg­u­la­tor.</p>
    <p>The Se­cu­ri­ties and Fu­tures Com­mis­sion (SFC) said se­ri­ous lapses and de­fi­cien­cies in man­age­ment con­trols at Gold­man Sachs (Asia) had con­trib­uted to the mis­ap­pro­pri­a­tion of US$2.6 bil­lion raised by the Malaysian sov­er­eign wealth fund. 1Malaysia De­vel­op­ment Ber­had (1MDB) raised the funds in three bond of­fer­ings in 2012 and 2013.</p>
    <p>A Gold­man Sachs spokesman said the Wall Street bank would is­sue a state­ment in due course.</p>
    <p>In July, Gold­man agreed to pay US$3.9 bil­lion to set­tle Malaysia’s crim­i­nal probe.</p>
    <p>The Malaysian and US au­thor­i­ties es­ti­mate US$4.5 bil­lion was stolen from 1MDB in an elab­o­rate scheme that spanned the globe and im­pli­cated high-level of­fi­cials in the fund, for­mer Malaysian prime min­is­ter Na­jib Razak, Gold­man staff and oth­ers.</p>
    <p>The three bond of­fer­ings, which raised a com­bined US$6.5 bil­lion, were ar­ranged and un­der­writ­ten by United King­dom-based Gold­man Sachs In­ter­na­tional, with work con­ducted by team mem­bers in mul­ti­ple ju­ris­dic­tions, who shared the rev­enue gen­er­ated.</p>
    <p>The SFC said Gold­man Sachs Asia, the bank’s Hong Kong-based com­pli­ance and con­trol hub for the re­gion, had sig­nif­i­cant in­volve­ment in the orig­i­na­tion, ap­proval, ex­e­cu­tion and sales process of the three of­fer­ings.</p>
    <p>The bank’s Asia hub had earned US$210 mil­lion from the of­fer­ings, the largest share among the var­i­ous Gold­man en­ti­ties.</p>
    <p>“This en­force­ment ac­tion is the re­sult of a rig­or­ous, in­de­pen­dent in­ves­ti­ga­tion con­ducted by the SFC,” said Ms Ash­ley Alder, the com­mis­sion’s chief ex­ec­u­tive.</p>
    <p>The 1MDB bond deals were ob­tained for Gold­man by its banker Tim Leiss­ner, who in Au­gust 2018 ad­mit­ted that he had con­spired with Malaysian fi­nancier Jho Low and oth­ers to pay bribes and kick­backs to Malaysian and Abu Dhabi of­fi­cials to ob­tain and re­tain the busi­ness from 1MDB for the bank.</p>
    <p>Low de­nies any wrong­do­ing.</p>
