    <p>Where the Covid-19 out­break has caused dif­fi­cul­ties in per­form­ing con­tracts inked be­fore the pan­demic, the ex­is­tence of force ma­jeure (FM) clauses in con­tracts could help par­ties exit their obli­ga­tions or at least reach a com­pro­mise, say lawyers.</p>
    <p>FM refers to a spe­cific con­trac­tual clause which frees both par­ties from li­a­bil­ity when un­ex­pected cir­cum­stances, such as nat­u­ral dis­as­ters or ter­ror­ist at­tacks, pre­vent a party from meet­ing its con­trac­tual obli­ga­tions.</p>
    <p>“A well-drafted FM clause, which makes ex­press pro­vi­sion for ‘pan­demics’ or ‘epi­demics’, could go some way in giv­ing con­tract­ing par­ties clar­ity on their con­trac­tual rights and obli­ga­tions in the cur­rent cli­mate,” said le­gal coun­sel Yvette An­thony of OC Queen Street LLC.</p>
    <p>“Con­versely, if the FM clause is vaguely drafted or is a mere af­ter­thought or boil­er­plate clause, chal­lenges abound. Par­ties may find them­selves mired in ar­gu­ments over whether they can avail them­selves of the FM pro­vi­sion in the cur­rent sit­u­a­tion.”</p>
    <p>For con­tracts that do not have an FM clause, there is also the le­gal doc­trine of frus­tra­tion, which op­er­ates by way of law and does not de­pend on the ex­is­tence of a con­trac­tual pro­vi­sion ex­cus­ing a party.</p>
    <p>“In prac­tice, frus­tra­tion can be more chal­leng­ing to in­voke as a party would have to demon­strate the ex­is­tence of an un­fore­seen event which ren­ders per­for­mance im­pos­si­ble – mere hard­ship be­ing in­suf­fi­cient to con­sti­tute a frus­trat­ing event. There­fore, a party seek­ing to ex­cuse per­for­mance of its obli­ga­tions would gen­er­ally tend to ar­gue the ex­is­tence of an FM event, if an FM clause ex­ists,” said Ms An­thony.</p>
    <p>FM clauses can ex­ist in all sorts of con­tracts re­gard­less of value, and are sub­ject to ne­go­ti­a­tion be­tween the par­ties as to their scope and ex­is­tence.</p>
    <p>Law part­ner Navin Joseph Lobo of Premier Law LLC notes that more clients are seek­ing ad­vice re­lat­ing to the op­er­a­tion of FM clauses.</p>
    <p>“The is­sues that we ad­vise on can be largely dis­tilled to those aris­ing when a party’s per­for­mance of its con­trac­tual obli­ga­tions is pre­vented or im­peded by the pan­demic or its re­sul­tant con­se­quences,” he said.</p>
    <p>There are cases where a “scan of the hori­zon” may fore­tell a party’s in­abil­ity to meet its obli­ga­tions when they be­come due in the fu­ture.</p>
    <p>Mr Lobo added that the per­for­mance dis­rup­tions typ­i­cally af­fect con­tracts and in­dus­tries hard hit by the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>“Re­stric­tions re­lat­ing to, for ex­am­ple, clo­sures of or oc­cu­pancy lev­els of busi­ness premises, work­place and pub­lic safe dis­tanc­ing mea­sures, and dis­rup­tions to sup­ply chains can af­fect per­for­mance of an agreed con­trac­tual obli­ga­tion and the com­mer­cial vi­a­bil­ity of the un­der­ly­ing con­tract.</p>
    <p>“We are see­ing this trans­late into dis­putes, par­tic­u­larly in re­la­tion to sup­ply con­tracts, con­struc­tion con­tracts as well as com­mer­cial con­tracts in the trans­port and ad­ver­tis­ing sec­tors.”</p>
    <p>Mr Lobo added that many clients whose busi­ness op­er­a­tions and con­trac­tual obli­ga­tions are af­fected by con­se­quences of the pan­demic are now tak­ing a closer look at the spe­cific word­ing of their FM clauses, point­ing out that specif­i­cally list­ing an “epi­demic or pan­demic” as a deemed FM event would make it that much eas­ier to seek re­lief based on the FM clause, pro­vided of course that all the other re­quire­ments of the FM clause are also ful­filled. Key among these is an ex­am­i­na­tion of whether the pan­demic has caused the par­tial or to­tal in­abil­ity to per­form the spe­cific con­trac­tual obli­ga­tion in ques­tion.</p>
    <p>“The scope and re­lief avail­able in re­spect of FM events are set by the par­ties, and so the prac­tice of repli­cat­ing stan­dard boil­er­plate clauses without ap­pro­pri­ate adap­tion for the spe­cific con­text should be dis­cour­aged.</p>
    <p>“Also, most busi­nesses should now be aware that the Sin­ga­pore Govern­ment has also en­acted leg­is­la­tion in re­sponse to Covid-19, namely the Covid-19 (Tem­po­rary Mea­sures) Act, which pro­vides var­i­ous tem­po­rary re­lief from the in­abil­ity to per­form con­trac­tual obli­ga­tions un­der cer­tain con­tracts if that in­abil­ity is ma­te­ri­ally caused by a Covid-19 event,” said Mr Lobo.</p>
