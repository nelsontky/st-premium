    <p>An 80-year-old man, his wife, 66, and their son, 45, died fol­low­ing a sus­pected elec­tro­cu­tion in­ci­dent in the el­derly cou­ple’s flat in Lake­side on Thurs­day.</p>
    <p>Po­lice said no foul play is sus­pected. They were alerted to the un­nat­u­ral deaths at Block 120 Ho Ching Road at about 4.15pm.</p>
    <p>The cou­ple were found ly­ing mo­tion­less and were pro­nounced dead at the scene by a para­medic.</p>
    <p>Their son, who was vis­it­ing them, was un­con­scious when the paramedics ar­rived. He was taken to Ng Teng Fong Gen­eral Hos­pi­tal, where he was later pro­nounced dead.</p>
    <p>The po­lice are in­ves­ti­gat­ing the fam­ily’s deaths.</p>
    <p>The el­derly man, Mr Omar Manan, re­port­edly fell in the shower. Both he and his wife, Madam As­mah Bu­jang, are be­lieved to have been elec­tro­cuted when she rushed in to as­sist him.</p>
    <p>Their son, Muhamad Ashikin Omar, and his 15-year-old daugh­ter were vis­it­ing them, ac­cord­ing to a fam­ily friend who spoke to Chi­nese news­pa­per Shin Min Daily News.</p>
    <p>Af­ter a pro­longed wait out­side the unit, the son broke down the door and en­tered the flat. On see­ing his par­ents on the ground, he tried to re­vive them. It is un­der­stood that he was elec­tro­cuted too.</p>
    <p>When The Straits Times went to the unit yes­ter­day, po­lice of­fi­cers were seen in­side the flat.</p>
    <p>A neigh­bour, who wanted to be known only as Madam Ting, told ST in Man­darin that the cou­ple lived alone and were vis­ited by their son and their daugh­ter-in­law al­most daily.</p>
    <p>The 77-year-old re­tiree, who has lived there for about 50 years, said: “I used to talk to them from the cor­ri­dor ev­ery day. They are a very close and pleas­ant fam­ily. I can’t be­lieve the three of them are gone.”</p>
    <p>The fu­neral, held at a rel­a­tive’s house in Kang Ching Road in the vicin­ity of the cou­ple’s flat, was un­der way when ST ar­rived.</p>
    <p>Rel­a­tives and friends of the fam­ily lined the cor­ri­dor and gath­ered in­side the flat to pay their re­spects.</p>
    <p>A rel­a­tive de­clined to com­ment, but said that the fam­ily wished to be left alone.</p>
    <p>Many peo­ple ar­rived dressed in black as the mourn­ers moved to the void deck for prayers.</p>
    <p>An­other neigh­bour, Mr Ab­dul­lah Adom, 62, told ST that he heard about the in­ci­dent at Fri­day prayers and de­cided to at­tend the prayers at the void deck.</p>
    <p>“Usu­ally, when some­thing like this hap­pens in the neigh­bour­hood, the Mus­lim neigh­bours will come down for prayers to show re­spect,” said the pack­ag­ing factory worker.</p>
    <p>Mr Muhamad Ashikin’s wife posted on Face­book yes­ter­day that her hus­band was a good fa­ther and son, and asked peo­ple to pray for her fam­ily.</p>
    <p>“To­day (Dec 11) is our daugh­ter’s 15th birth­day, and (to­mor­row) is my sis­ter-in-law’s, (but) she has lost both her par­ents and her only brother,” she said.</p>
