    <p>•</p>
    <p>ALMATY/NUR-SUL­TAN A party led by Kaza­khstan’s pow­er­ful ex­pres­i­dent Nur­sul­tan Nazarbayev is set to sweep its par­lia­men­tary elec­tion, as it has done for decades, with no ma­jor op­po­si­tion groups running in the vote.</p>
    <p>Pres­i­dent Kassym-Jo­mart Tokayev, hand­picked by Mr Nazarbayev as his suc­ces­sor in 2019, is also a se­nior mem­ber of the Nur Otan po­lit­i­cal party which con­trols 84 of 107 seats in Kaza­khstan’s Lower House.</p>
    <p>None of the four other par­ties running in yes­ter­day’s elec­tion has openly crit­i­cised Mr Nazarbayev or Mr Tokayev, fo­cus­ing their fire on lower-level of­fi­cials and their poli­cies in­stead, an ar­range­ment that gov­ern­ment crit­ics say is meant to cre­ate an il­lu­sion of plu­ral­ism.</p>
    <p>The Na­tion­wide So­cial Demo­cratic Party, the main op­po­si­tion party in the Cen­tral Asian na­tion,</p>
    <p>is boy­cotting the vote. An­other op­po­si­tion move­ment, the Demo­cratic Party, failed to se­cure of­fi­cial reg­is­tra­tion ahead of the vote.</p>
    <p>A few dozen mem­bers and sup­port­ers of the lat­ter ral­lied at a square in Kaza­khstan’s big­gest city Almaty yes­ter­day, shout­ing “Boy­cott!” and “Nazarbayev go away!” but were quickly sur­rounded by po­lice who de­tained about 30 peo­ple.</p>
    <p>The ab­sence of com­pe­ti­tion will dampen hopes of po­lit­i­cal re­form en­cour­aged by Kaza­khstan’s Western part­ners. But it will help to en­sure sta­bil­ity that has helped the coun­try of 19 mil­lion at­tract hun­dreds of bil­lions of dol­lars in for­eign in­vest­ment, pri­mar­ily into the oil, gas and min­ing sec­tors.</p>
    <p>Also, in an at­tempt to mod­ernise the sys­tem with­out re­lin­quish­ing his party’s tight grip on power, Mr Tokayev has over­seen the in­tro­duc­tion of quo­tas for women and un­der-29s in po­lit­i­cal par­ties’ can­di­date lists. “(Fur­ther) re­forms are be­ing pre­pared,” he told re­porters after casting his bal­lot in the cap­i­tal city of Nur-Sul­tan. “Re­forms must not stop.”</p>
    <p>One no­table fe­male can­di­date running on the Nur Otan ticket is Ms Dariga Nazarbayev­a, the for­mer pres­i­dent’s el­dest daugh­ter who van­ished from pol­i­tics and public view last May when Mr Tokayev re­moved her from the post of Up­per House speaker.</p>
    <p>Ms Nazarbayev­a’s re­turn to pol­i­tics has re­vived spec­u­la­tion that she might even­tu­ally run for pres­i­dency. De­spite step­ping down nearly two years ago, her 80-yearold fa­ther re­mains hugely in­flu­en­tial. In ad­di­tion to lead­ing the rul­ing party, he chairs the pow­er­ful na­tional se­cu­rity coun­cil.</p>
