    <p>The Covid-19 shock has been dev­as­tat­ing to the East Asian and Pa­cific re­gion, ac­cord­ing to the World Bank’s lat­est report on de­vel­op­ing economies. But it has also cre­ated op­por­tu­ni­ties to do bet­ter, says as­so­ciate editor Vikram Khanna (be­low).</p>
    <p>Last week, the World Bank re­leased its Oc­to­ber up­date on the de­vel­op­ing economies of East Asia and the Pa­cific (EAP) af­ter nine months of grap­pling with the Covid-19 pan­demic. The report, which does not cover Sin­ga­pore, makes for grim read­ing, but also points to some silver lin­ings.</p>
    <p>But first, the bad news: Al­though coun­tries in the re­gion have han­dled the pan­demic rel­a­tively well com­pared with some other parts of the world, such as South Asia, Latin Amer­ica and even the United States and Bri­tain, the pain has been se­vere.</p>
    <p>Eco­nomic growth in the EAP (ex­clud­ing China) in the first half of the year was the low­est since 1967: Out­put con­tracted by 4 per cent. For the year as a whole, the de­cline will be 3.5 per cent. If China is in­cluded, the re­gion will eke out growth of 0.9 per cent.</p>
    <p>MORE POVERTY</p>
    <p>The World Bank reck­ons that poverty in the de­vel­op­ing coun­tries of the EAP, such as In­done­sia, Malaysia, Thai­land, the Philip­pines, Cam­bo­dia, Fiji and Pa­pua New Guinea, will in­crease for the first time in 20 years: There will be about 38 mil­lion more poor peo­ple in the re­gion as a re­sult of the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>It points out that the Covid-19 shock is not only keep­ing peo­ple in poverty, but also cre­at­ing a class of “new poor”. What’s more, the im­pact could last as long as a decade.</p>
    <p>De­clines in in­vest­ment will re­duce fu­ture growth; sick­ness and un­em­ploy­ment will erode work­ers’ ca­pac­i­ties, and wide­spread school clo­sures will lead to mil­lions of chil­dren los­ing al­most a year’s worth of learning.</p>
    <p>The av­er­age stu­dent in the re­gion could face a re­duc­tion of about 4 per cent in ex­pected earn­ings ev­ery year of his work­ing life.</p>
    <p>Over­all, the pan­demic could re­duce eco­nomic growth by 1 per­cent­age point a year over the next decade, with the great­est im­pact felt by poor house­holds be­cause of lower lev­els of ac­cess to health­care, education, jobs and fi­nance.</p>
    <p>Gov­ern­ments across the re­gion have tried to cush­ion the blow. On av­er­age, they have com­mit­ted about 5 per cent of gross do­mes­tic prod­uct (GDP) in sup­port for pub­lic health sys­tems, house­holds and firms.</p>
    <p>But since they spent less than</p>
    <p>1 per cent of their GDP on so­cial as­sis­tance prior to Covid-19, scal­ing this up five­fold al­most overnight has been dif­fi­cult.</p>
    <p>Most of the as­sis­tance has not reached the in­tended ben­e­fi­cia­ries be­cause the data and the fi­nan­cial in­fras­truc­ture to dis­trib­ute the aid don’t ex­ist – al­though some coun­tries, such as Malaysia and Thai­land, which have more ro­bust med­i­cal, fi­nan­cial and dig­i­tal in­fra­struc­tures, have done bet­ter than the rest.</p>
    <p>The World Bank pro­poses a long list of poli­cies coun­tries need to adopt. These in­clude: wi­den­ing their so­cial pro­tec­tion – which means spend­ing more on pub­lic health and education; col­lect­ing more rev­enue through higher taxes and a broader tax base as well as cut­ting waste­ful sub­si­dies (like on fuel), to cover the huge fis­cal deficits that have emerged; and pro­vid­ing tar­geted sup­port to com­pa­nies, based not just on past per­for­mance or cur­rent pain, but the po­ten­tial to thrive in the fu­ture.</p>
    <p>Some of these pro­pos­als would ap­ply to Sin­ga­pore too.</p>
    <p>SILVER LIN­INGS</p>
    <p>But the pan­demic has also pro­duced silver lin­ings, some of which may seem sur­pris­ing.</p>
    <p>First, it has led to more re­gional in­te­gra­tion. The rel­a­tively fast re­cov­ery in the re­gion – es­pe­cially if we in­clude China, Tai­wan, South Korea and Ja­pan – has meant that in­tra-re­gional trade suf­fered less than trade in, and with, other parts of the world.</p>
    <p>No­tably, China’s im­ports from the Asean-5 (Malaysia, In­done­sia, the Philip­pines, Sin­ga­pore and Thai­land) rose 7.8 per cent from Jan­uary to July, com­pared with a de­cline of 0.4 per cent in the same pe­riod last year – this, de­spite China’s eco­nomic slow­down as well as its agree­ment to pur­chase more from the US as part of its trade deal.</p>
    <p>The re­gion also now gets more for­eign di­rect in­vest­ment from coun­tries in the re­gion than from out­side it.</p>
    <p>These trends will be re­in­forced once the Re­gional Com­pre­hen­sive Eco­nomic Part­ner­ship – a trade deal in­volv­ing 10 coun­tries of the Asia-Pa­cific – comes into force, which may hap­pen next year.</p>
    <p>Sec­ond, Covid-19 could ac­cel­er­ate the shift of global sup­ply chains away from China, and the rest of the re­gion could be among the big­gest ben­e­fi­cia­ries.</p>
    <p>The World Bank points out that judg­ing from Ja­pan’s ex­pe­ri­ence af­ter the 2011 tsunami hit the coun­try, im­porters did not try to reshore pro­duc­tion back to their home coun­tries. In­stead, they re­duced their ex­ces­sive de­pen­dence on Ja­panese sup­pli­ers by shift­ing oper­a­tions to other coun­tries in the re­gion.</p>
    <p>In the elec­tron­ics sec­tor, for in­stance, they shifted mainly to China, Viet­nam and Malaysia.</p>
    <p>Sim­i­lar trends could fol­low in the wake of the Covid-19 shock, ben­e­fit­ing coun­tries that have ca­pa­bil­i­ties in ar­eas where pro­duc­tion is con­cen­trated in China.</p>
    <p>The process is still in its early stages and China-based sup­ply chains will not be eas­ily dis­lodged. But Viet­nam, Malaysia and Thai­land have al­ready gained from the re­lo­ca­tion of some pro­duc­tion fa­cil­i­ties.</p>
    <p>A third silver lin­ing is that the pan­demic has ac­cel­er­ated in­vest­ments in dig­i­tal tech­nolo­gies through­out the re­gion. Many ob­servers point out that three years of dig­i­tal trans­for­ma­tion have been com­pressed into a few months.</p>
    <p>In the area of fi­nance, for ex­am­ple, the World Bank notes that across 74 coun­tries, since their Covid-19 lock­downs, daily down­loads of fin­tech apps have in­creased 24 per cent, with a marked 65 per cent in­crease in Asia. The use of cash has gone down ev­ery­where, even in Asia’s poorer economies.</p>
    <p>E-com­merce adop­tion has also soared. A study by Face­book and con­sult­ing firm Bain & Co on con­sumer habits in six South-east Asian coun­tries found that in the first half of the year, while 47 per cent of con­sumers re­duced their off­line pur­chases, 30 per cent in­creased their on­line spend­ing, de­spite in­comes hav­ing de­clined.</p>
    <p>This was es­pe­cially the case for es­sen­tial goods – 45 per cent of con­sumers in­creased their on­line pur­chases of gro­ceries.</p>
    <p>On the business front, ex­ports of on­line ser­vices have risen, es­pe­cially from coun­tries that spe­cialise in this area, such as Malaysia and the Philip­pines.</p>
    <p>A lot of these trends are likely to out­last the pan­demic. Com­put­ers bought and dig­i­tal skills learnt are here to stay. Once con­sumers have ex­pe­ri­enced the sav­ings and con­ve­niences re­sult­ing from the use of e-com­merce and cash­less pay­ments, their habits, in many cases, will per­ma­nently change, which cre­ates new op­por­tu­ni­ties for coun­tries to ex­pand into ex­ports of dig­i­tally de­liv­ered ser­vices.</p>
    <p>This has im­por­tant im­pli­ca­tions for the fu­ture of trade lib­er­al­i­sa­tion.</p>
    <p>So far, South-east Asian coun­tries have low­ered many bar­ri­ers to trade in goods. For in­stance, Asean has elim­i­nated al­most all tar­iffs among its mem­bers – al­though non-tar­iff bar­ri­ers re­main.</p>
    <p>But ser­vice sec­tors such as bank­ing, fi­nance, in­sur­ance, le­gal, telecom­mu­ni­ca­tions and med­i­cal ser­vices, among oth­ers, re­main heav­ily pro­tected, with re­stric­tions on for­eign en­try and other bar­ri­ers to com­pe­ti­tion.</p>
    <p>OPEN­ING UP SER­VICES</p>
    <p>The sep­a­rate treat­ment of goods and ser­vices in trade needs a relook.</p>
    <p>In­creas­ingly, man­u­fac­tur­ers need ef­fi­cient ser­vices such as trans­port and com­mu­ni­ca­tion, as well as re­search and de­vel­op­ment, to par­tic­i­pate in value chains.</p>
    <p>Goods and ser­vices are be­com­ing more com­ple­men­tary. For ex­am­ple, a 3D printer used in ad­di­tive man­u­fac­tur­ing falls un­der the goods cat­e­gory, but it is use­less with­out soft­ware, which is a ser­vice.</p>
    <p>A lot of the kinds of soft­ware that man­u­fac­tur­ers need, which in the past took the form of shrink-wrapped goods, are now pro­vided as ser­vices.</p>
    <p>Goods are also be­ing em­bed­ded or bun­dled with ser­vices, the clas­sic ex­am­ple be­ing the smart­phone – its value is greatly en­hanced with apps, which are ser­vices.</p>
    <p>While none of this is new, the ac­cel­er­a­tion of digi­ti­sa­tion af­ter Covid-19 has ac­cel­er­ated the “ser­vi­ci­fi­ca­tion” of man­u­fac­tur­ing, through the greater use of dig­i­tal tools – that is, ser­vices.</p>
    <p>No coun­try can up­grade its man­u­fac­tur­ing with­out ac­cess to high-qual­ity ser­vices, and this will not hap­pen if ser­vices are sub­ject to pro­tec­tion­ism.</p>
    <p>Then there is di­rect dig­i­tal trade in ser­vices, which has the scope to mas­sively ex­pand in the re­gion with higher digi­ti­sa­tion. But its po­ten­tial can­not be fully re­alised, given the lev­els of pro­tec­tion­ism that ex­ist.</p>
    <p>For ex­am­ple, to work well, dig­i­tal so­lu­tions need high-qual­ity tele­coms ser­vices with lots of com­pe­ti­tion to keep prices down, but in many coun­tries, bar­ri­ers to en­try pre­vent this.</p>
    <p>In the area of dig­i­tal fi­nan­cial ser­vices, coun­tries main­tain dif­fer­ent reg­u­la­tory and tech­ni­cal stan­dards that limit in­ter­op­er­abil­ity and, there­fore, cross-bor­der pro­vi­sion.</p>
    <p>The same is true for pro­fes­sional ser­vices that of­ten re­quire do­mes­tic li­cens­ing or other rules which ef­fec­tively pro­hibit ex­ports.</p>
    <p>For ex­am­ple, one of the trends we have seen dur­ing the pan­demic is the rapid adop­tion of telemedici­ne, which has opened up new chan­nels for the de­liv­ery of med­i­cal ser­vices. But there re­main lim­i­ta­tions on cross-bor­der pro­vi­sion.</p>
    <p>The World Trade Or­gan­i­sa­tion (WTO) points out that telemedici­ne is sub­ject to geographic re­stric­tions, such as re­quir­ing health pro­fes­sion­als to re­side in the same ju­ris­dic­tion as pa­tients. A pre-ex­ist­ing re­la­tion­ship be­tween pa­tients and health pro­fes­sion­als is also of­ten a pre­con­di­tion.</p>
    <p>While there are le­git­i­mate le­gal and eth­i­cal is­sues in­volved in the cross-bor­der pro­vi­sion of many tele­ser­vices, the WTO rec­om­mends that pol­i­cy­mak­ers ad­dress these chal­lenges and adapt their reg­u­la­tions to en­able more ser­vices to be re­motely pro­vided from abroad.</p>
    <p>Be­sides more flex­i­ble rules on lo­cal pres­ence re­quire­ments, the re­gion also needs greater adop­tion of elec­tronic con­tracts, freer cross-bor­der data flows, and less strin­gent reg­u­la­tions on data lo­cal­i­sa­tion – the re­quire­ment that data on con­sumers in a par­tic­u­lar coun­try re­mains in the coun­try.</p>
    <p>This is all the more ur­gent af­ter Covid-19, with digi­ti­sa­tion and re­mote de­liv­ery hav­ing be­come more com­mon.</p>
    <p>AN IN­CLU­SIVE RE­COV­ERY</p>
    <p>Fi­nally, there is the is­sue of the dig­i­tal di­vide – the dif­fer­ences in ac­cess to dig­i­tal ser­vices be­tween the rich and the poor. This has long been an is­sue in the EAP as in many other parts of the world, but it has be­come more se­ri­ous since the Covid-19 out­break, which has raised the pre­mium on dig­i­tal fa­cil­i­ties and skills.</p>
    <p>If the poor lack ac­cess to cheap com­put­ers, smart­phones, tele­coms and cloud ser­vices, or lack dig­i­tal skills, they will fall fur­ther be­hind in the post-Covid-19 econ­omy.</p>
    <p>They will also face the dan­ger of be­ing marginalis­ed by au­toma­tion and ar­ti­fi­cial in­tel­li­gence, which are pre­dicted to ac­cel­er­ate.</p>
    <p>If they are not to lose their liveli­hoods, mil­lions of work­ers in the man­u­fac­tur­ing sec­tors of the re­gion will need higher-or­der skills such as dig­i­tal lit­er­acy, prob­lem-solv­ing and the abil­ity to mon­i­tor ma­chines, as op­posed to do­ing repet­i­tive assem­bly tasks.</p>
    <p>This calls for not only easy and cheap ac­cess to hard­ware, in­clud­ing through sub­si­dies, but also reskilling on a mas­sive scale. Oth­er­wise, the post-Covid-19 re­cov­ery in the re­gion will not be in­clu­sive, which could cre­ate fur­ther prob­lems down the road.</p>
    <p>As ter­ri­ble as the shock of the pan­demic has been, it also presents op­por­tu­ni­ties for gov­ern­ments to build back bet­ter for the fu­ture. But they will need to adopt bold poli­cies that they have shied away from in the past.</p>
