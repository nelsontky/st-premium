    <p>WASH­ING­TON• The US Food and Drug Ad­min­is­tra­tion (FDA) has granted emer­gency-use au­tho­ri­sa­tion to Yale School of Pub­lic Health’s saliva test to de­tect Covid-19, after a trial on Na­tional Bas­ket­ball As­so­ci­a­tion (NBA) play­ers and staff.</p>
    <p>Sali­vaDi­rect, the fifth saliva test ap­proved by the FDA for the dis­ease, re­quires no swab or col­lec­tion de­vice and uses spit from peo­ple sus­pected of hav­ing the coro­n­avirus, the agency said.</p>
    <p>FDA com­mis­sioner Stephen Hahn called the saliva test ground­break­ing in its ef­fi­ciency and in be­ing un­af­fected by cru­cial com­po­nent short­ages.</p>
    <p>Sali­vaDi­rect is seen as a cheap, sim­pler and less in­va­sive test­ing method that re­quires no ex­trac­tion of nu­cleic acid and can use sev­eral read­ily avail­able reagents.</p>
    <p>The NBA has used the test in a pro­gramme in­volv­ing asymp­to­matic play­ers, coaches and staff from var­i­ous teams, after part­ner­ing with Yale in June, the school said on Satur­day in a sep­a­rate state­ment.</p>
    <p>“We sim­pli­fied the test so that it only costs a cou­ple of dol­lars for reagents, and we ex­pect that labs will only charge about US$10 (S$14) per sam­ple,” As­sis­tant Pro­fes­sor Nathan Grubaugh said at the Yale School of Pub­lic Health.</p>
    <p>One of the goals of the re­search team was to elim­i­nate the need for ex­pen­sive saliva col­lec­tion tubes, and a sep­a­rate study found that the virus is stable in saliva for pro­longed pe­ri­ods at warm tem­per­a­tures, and that preser­va­tives or spe­cial test tubes were not nec­es­sary, Yale said.</p>
    <p>The FDA said the test could lower the risk to health­care work­ers from col­lect­ing sam­ples as it is self-col­lected un­der the ob­ser­va­tion of a health­care pro­fes­sional.</p>
