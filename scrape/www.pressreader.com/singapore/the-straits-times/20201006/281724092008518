    <p>A travel event next month will be the first trade show here to pi­lot new safety mea­sures for Mice (meet­ings, in­cen­tives, con­ven­tions and ex­hi­bi­tions) events, such as au­to­mated reg­is­tra­tion kiosks, amid the Covid-19 pan­demic.</p>
    <p>The Trav­elRe­vive trade show will also trial con­tact­less tech­nol­ogy fol­low­ing the eas­ing of rules for Mice events an­nounced last month.</p>
    <p>For in­stance, by scan­ning QR codes, at­ten­dees will be able to regis­ter for the event and down­load booth ma­te­ri­als of ex­hibitors to min­imise con­tact be­tween them, Messe Berlin (Sin­ga­pore), which is or­gan­is­ing the Trav­elRe­vive event with the Sin­ga­pore Tourism Board (STB), said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The two-day show runs from Nov 25 to 26 and will be held at the Ma­rina Bay Sands Expo and Con­ven­tion Cen­tre.</p>
    <p>Other safety mea­sures that will be in place for Trav­elRe­vive in­clude plex­i­glass shields in ex­hi­bi­tion booths and meet­ing pods, which will al­low for pri­vate meet­ings be­tween ex­hibitors and buy­ers.</p>
    <p>These meet­ing pods will en­sure the safety of those at the event, since they re­duce the trans­mis­sion of droplets, which are known to spread the coro­n­avirus, said Messe Berlin (Sin­ga­pore).</p>
    <p>In ad­di­tion, so­cial dis­tanc­ing am­bas­sadors will be de­ployed on-site, the con­fer­ence room floor plan will be re­con­fig­ured to al­low so­cial dis­tanc­ing, and con­tact trac­ing will be done.</p>
    <p>The event is ex­pected to host 250 peo­ple from var­i­ous Asian coun­tries, and the mea­sures it is tri­alling come af­ter STB last month an­nounced re­laxed rules for Mice events that had been in place to limit the spread of Covid-19.</p>
    <p>STB said then that event or­gan­is­ers could ap­ply to pi­lot big­ger Mice events with up to 250 par­tic­i­pants from Oct 1.</p>
    <p>This is an in­crease from the pre­vi­ous max­i­mum num­ber of 50 at­ten­dees and is in line with the grad­ual re­sump­tion of eco­nomic ac­tiv­i­ties in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>The Mice in­dus­try plays an im­por­tant role in Sin­ga­pore, sup­port­ing more than 34,000 jobs with an eco­nomic value-add of $3.8 bil­lion, or nearly 1 per cent of Sin­ga­pore’s gross do­mes­tic prod­uct (GDP), ac­cord­ing to a sur­vey com­mis­sioned by the STB last year.</p>
    <p>But the Mice in­dus­try is among</p>
    <p>250</p>
    <p>Num­ber of peo­ple from var­i­ous Asian coun­tries ex­pected at the Travel Re­vive trade show.</p>
    <p>34k</p>
    <p>Ap­prox­i­mate num­ber of jobs that the Mice in­dus­try sup­ports in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>$3.8b</p>
    <p>The eco­nomic value-add of the Mice sec­tor in Sin­ga­pore, about 1 per cent of the Re­pub­lic’s GDP.</p>
    <p>the sec­tors most se­verely af­fected by the Covid-19 pan­demic.</p>
    <p>The new Mice event safety mea­sures to be tested at next month’s Trav­elRe­vive were de­vel­oped by the Al­liance for Ac­tion on En­abling Safe and In­no­va­tive Vis­i­tor Ex­pe­ri­ences.</p>
    <p>The al­liance is one of those formed un­der the Emerg­ing Stronger Task­force.</p>
    <p>These al­liances are in­dus­try-led and gov­ern­ment-sup­ported coali­tions that test ideas in key strate­gic ar­eas for Sin­ga­pore dur­ing the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>The al­liance has also de­signed itin­er­ar­ies, com­pris­ing a se­lec­tion of leisure ac­tiv­i­ties that com­ply with pre­vail­ing safe man­age­ment guide­lines, which will be tri­alled with the at­ten­dees of Trav­elRe­vive.</p>
    <p>These itin­er­ar­ies could serve as a model for small groups of in­ter­na­tional vis­i­tors when in­ter­na­tional travel re­sumes even­tu­ally, Messe Berlin (Sin­ga­pore) said.</p>
    <p>Last Thurs­day, STB called a ten­der to ap­point two to three des­ti­na­tion man­age­ment com­pa­nies to de­sign and pi­lot these itin­er­ar­ies for Trav­elRe­vive par­tic­i­pants.</p>
    <p>In their pro­pos­als, firms should al­low for data col­lec­tion of del­e­gate pref­er­ences, which will go to­wards de­vel­op­ing and re­fin­ing fu­ture itin­er­ar­ies.</p>
    <p>They should also gather feed­back on the ca­pa­bil­i­ties and skill sets that the itin­er­ar­ies re­quire.</p>
    <p>Be­sides test­ing new safety mea­sures, Trav­elRe­vive will have vir­tual el­e­ments, such as a live tele­cast of con­fer­ences and an on­line ex­hibitor di­rec­tory.</p>
    <p>STB’s as­sis­tant chief ex­ec­u­tive Yap Chin Siang said: “To­gether with our in­dus­try, we want to set Sin­ga­pore apart as the world’s lead­ing des­ti­na­tion for safe, trusted and in­no­va­tive business events.”</p>
