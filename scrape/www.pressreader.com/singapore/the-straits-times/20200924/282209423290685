    <p>Our pub­lic sports fa­cil­i­ties no longer seem eas­ily ac­ces­si­ble to mem­bers of the pub­lic.</p>
    <p>In re­cent months, I have turned up on sev­eral oc­ca­sions at Bukit Gom­bak Sta­dium, only to be turned away be­cause it was closed for an “ex­clu­sive book­ing”.</p>
    <p>More re­cently, I showed up at the fa­cil­ity on a Sun­day af­ter­noon, only to find it closed yet again for an­other pri­vate book­ing.</p>
    <p>Bukit Gom­bak Sta­dium is open ev­ery day from 7am to 9.30pm. Ac­cord­ing to in­for­ma­tion on­line, the fa­cil­ity is now closed for book­ings on Sun­days from 7am to 11.30am, and 3pm to 5pm.</p>
    <p>That amounts to al­most half of the day’s open­ing hours.</p>
    <p>As it is, I be­lieve the max­i­mum num­ber of peo­ple al­lowed in sports fa­cil­i­ties is 50 at any one time, un­der so­cial dis­tanc­ing rules.</p>
    <p>On Sun­days now, with such ex­tended clo­sures, mem­bers of the pub­lic are left with only the hottest time of the day, in the mid-af­ter­noon, and the most crowded, in the evening, to use the fa­cil­ity, and only in re­stricted num­bers.</p>
    <p>I have seen long queues in the evenings at the sta­dium, which may only grow worse now. In fact, on both Satur­day and Sun­day morn­ings, which are pop­u­lar recre­ational and ex­er­cise times for the el­derly and fam­i­lies, the sta­dium is closed for book­ings.</p>
    <p>We all take a cer­tain mea­sure of risk when ven­tur­ing out into pub­lic spa­ces at a time when the Covid-19 virus is still a threat. Now, with these clo­sures and ex­clu­sive book­ings, one ei­ther has to be vig­i­lant about keep­ing up with the con­stantly chang­ing hours when these pub­lic fa­cil­i­ties are ac­tu­ally open to the pub­lic, or take the risk and show up in the hope that they are not shut for ex­clu­sive use.</p>
    <p>At a time when pub­lic health is still a big con­cern, and re­sources are lim­ited, is this the best way that the pub­lic good is be­ing served?</p>
