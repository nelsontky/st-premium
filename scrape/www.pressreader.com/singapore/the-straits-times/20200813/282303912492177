    <p>Many of the shares that stay listed on Sin­ga­pore Ex­change’s Catal­ist board for over seven years have un­der­per­formed, ac­cord­ing to a new study.</p>
    <p>It ex­am­ined Catal­ist is­suers with net in­come fig­ures avail­able for the 2019 fi­nan­cial year.</p>
    <p>The re­port showed that out of 214 com­pa­nies, 56.5 per cent or 121 firms made losses.</p>
    <p>Among those listed fewer than seven years, 37 per cent were mak­ing losses, while 71 per cent of those listed for more than seven years were in the red.</p>
    <p>“While not con­clu­sive, this is con­trary to ex­pec­ta­tions as one would ex­pect growth com­pa­nies to start as rel­a­tively un­prof­itable com­pa­nies and be­come more prof­itable over time,” noted the re­port from As­so­ci­ate Pro­fes­sor Mak Yuen Teen of the Na­tional Univer­sity of Sin­ga­pore Busi­ness School and in­vestor and re­searcher Chew Yi Hong. They have urged that a re­view of the Catal­ist board be un­der­taken.</p>
    <p>The re­port also noted the con­flicts of in­ter­est in the spon­sor­ship regime due to busi­ness re­la­tion­ships be­tween spon­sors and the com­pa­nies they sup­port.</p>
    <p>Prof Mak and Mr Chew ar­gued that spon­sors might hes­i­tate to re­port dis­clo­sure or com­pli­ance breaches by is­suers be­cause they do not want to lose rev­enue from these firms.</p>
    <p>An is­suer is free to change spon­sor af­ter three years of list­ing on Catal­ist and may drop one that it does not see eye to eye with. “A change in spon­sor is a po­ten­tial warn­ing sign for Catal­ist com­pa­nies, and mul­ti­ple changes/short re­la­tion­ships be­tween a com­pany and spon­sor are more likely to in­di­cate prob­lems with the is­suer,” the re­port said.</p>
    <p>There were 215 com­pa­nies listed on Catal­ist as of May this year and 20 spon­sors.</p>
    <p>The top three spon­sors are PrimePart­ners Cor­po­rate Fi­nance, which spon­sors 55 com­pa­nies or 25 per cent, SAC Cap­i­tal with 35 (16 per cent) and RHT Cap­i­tal on 25 (12 per cent).</p>
