    <p>Why do I go bus-hop­ping? Be­cause it makes me feel like a tourist in my own coun­try.</p>
    <p>Rid­ing through un­fa­mil­iar neigh­bour­hoods with no end goal be­sides ex­plo­ration, I am no longer a com­muter but a trav­eller, and sud­denly, a city that once seemed mun­dane is filled with won­der.</p>
    <p>I gain a new per­spec­tive – quite lit­er­ally, tak­ing in the sights from the up­per deck of a 518 bus as it zips down the ex­press­way to Or­chard, or mar­vel­ling, from the win­dow seat of a 145 bus, at the shop­houses and chang­ing face of hous­ing in Tan­jong Pa­gar. The bus also passes Kep­pel Har­bour, and the large cranes re­mind me of gi­raffes in the twi­light.</p>
    <p>The five pub­lic bus routes were cho­sen for their scenery as well as nearby her­itage and recre­ational attraction­s. Ser­vice 975, for ex­am­ple, goes through Lim Chu Kang, in­clud­ing a tree-lined her­itage road which used to serve plan­ta­tions in the area. Rid­ing past the aban­doned Neo Tiew hous­ing es­tate, I get into a con­tem­pla­tive mood.</p>
    <p>A long bus ride can be med­i­ta­tive or mad­den­ing, de­pend­ing on your state of mind. Ei­ther way, there is plea­sure to be found in the com­fort­ing, pre­dictable rhythms of the bus, and the way the chang­ing view of­fers a scenic back­drop to thoughts and con­ver­sa­tions.</p>
    <p>We move in an air-con­di­tioned bub­ble de­tached from the smell and hub­bub of the streets – but with am­ple op­por­tu­nity to gaze, voyeuris­ti­cally, at peo­ple go­ing about their daily busi­ness.</p>
    <p>The best jour­neys of­ten hit that sweet spot be­tween struc­ture and spon­tane­ity. Bus-hop­ping, per­haps, can feel a bit like be­ing in a Choose Your Own Ad­ven­ture book, where you pick how you want your story to go: “Trans­fer to 167 to head to Bukit Merah. Stay on 980 to con­tinue your jour­ney to Gey­lang.”</p>
    <p>Some­times, the un­ex­pected things – a rain­bow, say, or an odd de­tour – make a jour­ney spe­cial.</p>
    <p>This fea­ture does not pre­tend to be ex­haus­tive, and has omit­ted pop­u­lar routes, such as 36, which takes you from Changi Air­port to Or­chard, and 67, which trav­els from Tampines to Choa Chu Kang via Ro­chor and Bukit Timah.</p>
    <p>To craft a more con­crete plan, re­fer to the Tran­sitLink web­site for the full list of stops and flesh out your itin­er­ary with the help of Google Maps and bus­router.sg.</p>
    <p>So tell us, what are your favourite bus routes? Write in with your sug­ges­tions. Who knows, there may be enough for a se­quel.</p>
