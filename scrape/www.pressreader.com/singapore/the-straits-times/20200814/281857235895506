    <p>After the re­lease of the dis­mal sec­ond-quar­ter gross do­mes­tic prod­uct growth num­bers on Tues­day, Trade and In­dus­try Min­is­ter Chan Chun Sing pointed to some painful truths that Sin­ga­pore will have to ac­cept and con­tend with, go­ing for­ward. The “old nor­mal” of the pre-Covid-19 world will not come back; eco­nomic re­cov­ery will take time and is un­likely to be smooth; and Sin­ga­pore can­not af­ford to hun­ker down and wait for the cri­sis to pass, but must chart a new di­rec­tion now for a very dif­fer­ent and un­cer­tain fu­ture. There are four big changes that are shap­ing the new nor­mal: a more frac­tious and un­cer­tain geopo­lit­i­cal en­vi­ron­ment; the re­order­ing of sup­ply chains; the trans­for­ma­tion of jobs, with the rise of re­mote work; and a pos­si­ble in­crease in so­cial fric­tions as the eco­nomic pie shrinks. These trends will have pro­found im­pli­ca­tions for com­pa­nies, work­ers as well as pub­lic poli­cies, cre­at­ing both new chal­lenges and op­por­tu­ni­ties.</p>
    <p>Go­ing for­ward, eco­nomic growth, while not as bad as in the sec­ond quar­ter, will re­main sub­dued. The weak­ness of ex­ter­nal de­mand will per­sist amid the global re­ces­sion. Do­mes­tic de­mand will also soften as job losses mount, and con­sumers and busi­nesses turn more cau­tious. Among sec­tors, the hard­est hit will be those that de­pend on open bor­ders such as avi­a­tion, tourism and hos­pi­tal­ity. They will need to rein­vent their busi­ness mod­els. The re­shap­ing of sup­ply chains with more em­pha­sis on re­silience than ef­fi­ciency will force com­pa­nies to shift pro­duc­tion lo­ca­tions as well as pro­cesses, some of which will in­volve higher costs. But as the Gov­ern­ment has noted, on the pos­i­tive side, the di­ver­si­fi­ca­tion of sup­ply chains could also mean more in­vest­ment in Asean, in­clud­ing Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>The rise of re­mote work will trans­late into an in­tensely com­pet­i­tive global job mar­ket. This can cut both ways, en­abling Sin­ga­pore work­ers – and pro­fes­sion­als, man­agers, ex­ec­u­tives and tech­ni­cians (PMETs) in par­tic­u­lar – to find op­por­tu­ni­ties outside Sin­ga­pore, but also caus­ing more com­pe­ti­tion for jobs here from work­ers over­seas. Non-PMETs will face se­vere chal­lenges. They will bear the brunt of lay­offs and many will be forced into self-em­ploy­ment or into the gig econ­omy.</p>
    <p>This will raise is­sues for pub­lic pol­icy, in­clud­ing putting in place stronger pro­tec­tions for such work­ers such as min­i­mum stan­dards for work­ing con­di­tions and ben­e­fits. The post-Covid-19 econ­omy will also call for a re­shap­ing of the so­cial con­tract, in par­tic­u­lar stronger safety nets, es­pe­cially for the un­em­ployed. The ex­pe­ri­ence with the pan­demic shows that coun­tries with weak safety nets are at greater risk, both in terms of eco­nomic re­silience and so­cial sta­bil­ity. A more ro­bust so­cial con­tract will add to Sin­ga­pore’s strengths of open­ness, rule of law and a trusted rep­u­ta­tion, and bet­ter en­able it to nav­i­gate the very dif­fer­ent and un­cer­tain fu­ture it faces.</p>
