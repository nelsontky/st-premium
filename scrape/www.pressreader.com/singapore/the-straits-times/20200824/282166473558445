    <p>I would like to call for a re­view of the lan­guage used in posters put up around Singapore that say “don’t be silent, re­port if you are mo­lested”.</p>
    <p>Such mes­sag­ing places the onus of re­port­ing mo­lesta­tion or sex­ual as­sault en­tirely on the vic­tim.</p>
    <p>We all know that vic­tim blam­ing is a prob­lem. Such be­hav­iour by so­ci­ety is just one of the many rea­sons vic­tims do not speak up or seek help.</p>
    <p>Of­ten, vic­tims have been judged more harshly even by the well-mean­ing, with some ques­tion­ing the vic­tim’s own re­spon­si­bil­ity or be­hav­iour that they think could have con­trib­uted to the crime.</p>
    <p>Lan­guage is im­por­tant, and how we dis­cuss as­sault has to change. So, in­stead of fo­cus­ing on the si­lence of vic­tims, we should switch to ad­dress­ing the as­saulter or mo­lester di­rectly.</p>
    <p>We should also an­gle the mes­sag­ing on peo­ple who might have no­ticed any­thing un­to­ward, to come for­ward and sup­port the vic­tims, by re­port­ing, by check­ing, by not stay­ing silent.</p>
    <p>Sex­ual as­sault is a com­pli­cated and dif­fi­cult sit­u­a­tion to be in and not by any vic­tim’s choice.</p>
    <p>Why then do they have to an­swer to and jus­tify them­selves to the pub­lic?</p>
    <p>To make mat­ters worse, the per­pe­tra­tors are of­ten not given even half the same kind of scru­tiny or put un­der the spot­light as much as vic­tims.</p>
    <p>In­stead of ask­ing vic­tims to speak up, why not say in­stead: Mo­lest­ing some­one is a crime. If you mo­lest some­one, you will be caned, fined and/or im­pris­oned.</p>
