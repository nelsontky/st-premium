    <p>If there is a beauty con­test among the cars on sale here, the Mini Cooper S Con­vert­ible and Suzuki Jimny will likely be among the top fi­nal­ists.</p>
    <p>Both two-door life­style cars are head turn­ers: The Mini is as pretty as a peach, avail­able in a va­ri­ety of colours and brim­ming with Bri­tish her­itage cues, while the Jimny is as cute as a but­ton and drip­ping with rugged charm.</p>
    <p>But the sim­i­lar­i­ties end there. The Mini looks pe­tite and curvy while the Jimny is brash and boxy. The Mini loves bask­ing in the sun while the Jimny loves a lit­tle mud on its tyres.Both are also in dif­fer­ent price seg­ments.</p>
    <p>But those who are shop­ping for a two-door life­style car should have them on their short­list for their sheer de­sir­abil­ity.</p>
    <p>Which will win you over? The Straits Times lines them up.</p>
    <p>THE CARS</p>
    <p>The most iconic Mini must be the two-door ver­sion of the car, which has since evolved into at least four more body-styles: a five-door, the sta­tion-wag­o­nish Club­man, the SUV-ish Coun­try­man and the Con­vert­ible re­viewed here.</p>
    <p>Adding to the mix are dif­fer­ent per­for­mance lev­els – from the en­try-level One to the mid-range Cooper, the high-per­for­mance Cooper S and the manic John Cooper Works.</p>
    <p>This Cooper S ver­sion of the Con­vert­ible is me­chan­i­cally sim­i­lar to the Mini Cooper S 60th edi­tion re­viewed by ST in July last year, ex­cept that it has a rag-top.</p>
    <p>Suzuki’s fourth-gen­er­a­tion Jimny, launched last year, is a con­tin­u­a­tion of an off-roader that has be­come some­what of a cult clas­sic, even among non-car en­thu­si­asts.</p>
    <p>It is par­tic­u­larly pop­u­lar among those who want to look like they lead an out­doorsy life­style, yet do not ex­actly want to go off-road.</p>
    <p>For this gen­er­a­tion, the Jimny has been thor­oughly up­dated in­side and out – with smarter styling, more safety fea­tures and more power.</p>
    <p>But it still has a tra­di­tional lad­der-frame chas­sis and rigid-axle/ coil spring sus­pen­sion, mak­ing it a proper off-roader. It also re­tains a low-range trans­fer case that lets the driver switch be­tween 2-High, 4-High and 4-Low trans­mis­sion modes for bet­ter rock-crawl­ing.</p>
    <p>SIZE</p>
    <p>Both the Mini and Jimny are easy to drive and par­al­lel park.</p>
    <p>De­spite its name, the Mini is ac­tu­ally larger than the Jimny – it is longer (3,850mm ver­sus the J i mn y ’ s 3,480mm), wider (1,727mm ver­sus 1,645mm) and has a longer wheel­base (2,495mm ver­sus 2,250mm).</p>
    <p>Nei­ther car is es­pe­cially spa­cious. There is not much room for rear oc­cu­pants or cargo. But the Jimny’s rear seats can be folded down to cre­ate a com­pletely flat cargo floor.</p>
    <p>IN­TE­RIOR AND EQUIP­MENT</p>
    <p>The Mini’s in­te­rior is more stylish, with a dom­i­nant round cen­tre con­sole and silver air­craft-style tog­gle switches.</p>
    <p>Un­like the ef­fer­ves­cent Mini, the Jimny’s bub­bly ex­te­rior does not trans­late to its in­te­rior. The Suzuki’s plas­tic trim – se­vere in black – pri­ori­tises func­tion above form, in­clud­ing a hor­i­zon­tal grab bar for the front pas­sen­ger when things get rocky.</p>
    <p>It has just enough styling flair to keep your eyes oc­cu­pied, such as the faux “bolted” in­stru­ment bin­na­cle sur­rounds and chunky air-con­di­tion­ing vents.</p>
    <p>The Jimny’s boxy shape means rear oc­cu­pants have more head­room than in the Mini. Its wider and taller doors also make it eas­ier to get into the car. With the roof up, pas­sen­gers would have to con­tort them­selves to get into the Mini’s rear seats.</p>
    <p>The Jimny also scores in prac­ti­cal­ity. Swing the wide, as­sisted tail­gate open, fold down the two rear seats and you have 830 litres of boot space – not some­thing the Mini can do. But with all four seats up, you may have to lash your shop­ping atop the roof as boot space shrinks to 85 litres.</p>
    <p>For safety, both are equipped with trac­tion and sta­bil­ity con­trol sys­tems.</p>
    <p>The Jimny comes with dual sen­sor brake sup­port (the ve­hi­cle au­to­mat­i­cally ap­plies stronger brake pres­sure upon de­tec­tion of an im­mi­nent col­li­sion), ve­hi­cle sway warn­ing and lane de­par­ture warn­ing, while the Mini has dy­namic brake lights and a roll bar that pops up to of­fer head pro­tec­tion to its oc­cu­pants in the event of a rollover.</p>
    <p>PER­FOR­MANCE</p>
    <p>The Mini is the run­away win­ner in road per­for­mance.</p>
    <p>It has a big­ger, tur­bocharged en­gine that puts out more power (192hp ver­sus 101hp) and torque (280Nm ver­sus 130Nm). It has a seven-speed twin-clutch gear­box, while the Suzuki has a four-speed au­to­box.</p>
    <p>The Mini com­pletes the cen­tury sprint in 7.1 sec­onds, about half the Jimny’s glacial 14 sec­onds. It also has a higher top speed of 230kmh, com­pared with the Jimny’s 140kmh.</p>
    <p>On the move, the Mini shines with its famed kart-like han­dling. It tack­les bendy roads with a re­fresh­ing ea­ger­ness and deft­ness, whereas the Jimny is painfully slow. It takes its own sweet time to ac­cel­er­ate and, with an agri­cul­tural en­gine note, makes sure you know it does not like to be pushed hard. Its rough un­der­pin­nings do it no dy­namic favours ei­ther.</p>
    <p>On the move, the Mini feels planted at ex­press­way speeds, like it is al­most egging you to go faster. On the other hand, the Jimny ought not be driven above 90kmh be­cause its steer­ing gets vague past that speed.</p>
    <p>But when the tar­mac ends and gravel, mud or dirt tracks start, it is the Jimny that will keep driv­ing on, as the Mini sur­ren­ders.</p>
    <p>In terms of fuel con­sump­tion, the Mini recorded 8.9 litres/100km over a 333km test-drive – higher than the of­fi­cial 5.7 litres/100km.</p>
    <p>The four-wheel-drive Jimny scored a thirstier 9.5 litres/100km over 244km – also ap­pre­cia­bly higher than the of­fi­cial fig­ure of 6.7 litres/100km.</p>
    <p>Putting a cou­ple more gears into its gear­box could bring down the fuel con­sump­tion.</p>
    <p>CON­CLU­SION</p>
    <p>The Mini costs nearly twice as much as the Jimny ($181,888 ver­sus $99,900).</p>
    <p>But both cars are stylish, at­trac­tive and unique in their own right. They are per­fect city cars with an ad­di­tional pur­pose of ei­ther sun­tan­ning and mud-plug­ging.</p>
    <p>Which­ever one you pick, you can still roll up the drive­way of a fives­tar ho­tel for valet park­ing.</p>
    <p>The Jimny, with its many com­par­isons to the vastly pricier Mercedes-Benz G-Class in both looks and ca­pa­bil­ity, is a se­ri­ous value propo­si­tion.</p>
    <p>But in this show­down of the head-turn­ers, the Mini – with bet­ter brand recog­ni­tion, a su­pe­rior drive and bet­ter build qual­ity – is the win­ner.</p>
