    <p>TOKYO • For­mer Ja­panese prime min­is­ter Shinzo Abe yes­ter­day vis­ited the con­tro­ver­sial Ya­sukuni Shrine for war dead, his first visit since De­cem­ber 2013, af­ter re­frain­ing from do­ing so for most of his term to avoid an­ger­ing China and South Korea.</p>
    <p>Mr Abe an­nounced the visit on his of­fi­cial Twit­ter ac­count, along with a photo of himself at the shrine, just days af­ter he was suc­ceeded as prime min­is­ter by Mr Yoshi­hide Suga.</p>
    <p>Ja­pan’s long­est-serv­ing leader an­nounced his res­ig­na­tion in late Au­gust, cit­ing health prob­lems.</p>
    <p>The shrine is seen by Bei­jing and Seoul as a sym­bol of Ja­pan’s past mil­i­tary ag­gres­sion be­cause it hon­ours, be­sides those who died in wars, 14 Ja­panese wartime lead­ers con­victed as war crim­i­nals by an Al­lied tri­bunal.</p>
    <p>Mr Abe had vis­ited the shrine in per­son once dur­ing his last ten­ure as prime min­is­ter but reg­u­larly sent of­fer­ings via an aide on the an­niver­sary of Ja­pan’s sur­ren­der in World War II and dur­ing the shrine’s spring and au­tumn fes­ti­vals.</p>
    <p>His visit to the shrine in 2013 sparked outrage across South Korea and China and an ex­pres­sion of “dis­ap­point­ment” from the United States.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, South Korea’s for­eign min­istry re­leased a state­ment ex­press­ing “deep con­cern and re­gret” that Mr Abe had paid re­spect at the shrine “im­me­di­ately” af­ter his res­ig­na­tion as prime min­is­ter.</p>
    <p>Mr Suga, who was the chief gov­ern­ment spokesman in Mr Abe’s ad­min­is­tra­tion, was not among the Abe Cabi­net min­is­ters who vis­ited the shrine this year on the 75th an­niver­sary of the end of World War II</p>
    <p>on Aug 15.</p>
    <p>Mr Suga had made a visit to the shrine in Au­gust 2011, ac­cord­ing to a post on his of­fi­cial blog, well be­fore be­com­ing the Abe gov­ern­ment’s chief Cabi­net sec­re­tary in De­cem­ber 2012.</p>
    <p>Wash­ing­ton and Tokyo have be­come close se­cu­rity al­lies in the decades since the war’s end but its le­gacy has left scars in East Asia.</p>
    <p>Re­la­tions be­tween Tokyo and Seoul have re­mained strained due to bit­ter mem­o­ries of Ja­pan’s 1910-1945 coloni­sa­tion of the Korean penin­sula, in­clud­ing a dis­pute over com­pen­sa­tion for Kore­ans forced to work on Ja­pan’s sites dur­ing the war.</p>
    <p>Tokyo says the mat­ter was set­tled by a 1965 treaty nor­mal­is­ing bi­lat­eral re­la­tions.</p>
