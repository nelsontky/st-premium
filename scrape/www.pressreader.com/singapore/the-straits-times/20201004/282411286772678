    <p>A few hun­dred me­tres away from Fu­rama River­Front, the co-work­ing space at Grand Copthorne Wa­ter­front Ho­tel’s lobby (left) is cosier and qui­eter. Thick brass pil­lars, wooden desks and mar­ble floors cre­ate a pro­fes­sional, if cookie-cut­ter, set­ting.</p>
    <p>The space seats 40. About half the seats are usu­ally filled since its launch in the mid­dle of last month, es­ti­mates Mr Lee Richards, Mil­len­nium Ho­tels and Re­sorts’s vice-pres­i­dent of oper­a­tions for South-east Asia.</p>
    <p>OF­FICE FOR THE DAY</p>
    <p>The lounge over­looks the Sin­ga­pore River, but the blinds are down dur­ing my visit to keep out the af­ter­noon sun. This cre­ates a dim and cosy at­mos­phere that is great for af­ter­noon naps, if not the best for pro­duc­tiv­ity.</p>
    <p>Rec­tan­gu­lar ta­bles are large enough for work, and help­ful yet un­ob­tru­sive waiters keep glasses filled. Most ta­bles have power sock­ets. The lounge is quiet enough for calls – so quiet that it felt like I was dis­turb­ing the peace when I had to make one.</p>
    <p>FEEL­ING PECK­ISH?</p>
    <p>If drinks are all you are after, the Mil­len­nium I pack­age, at a pro­mo­tional price of $16 a day, in­cludes free-flow cof­fee, tea, soft drinks</p>
    <p>and juices. You won’t find any wa­tered-down caf­feine here – the ho­tel serves a re­spectable latte, and the tea menu in­cludes op­tions such as Yun­nan pu erh and South African Rooi­bos, on top of the usual sus­pects such as English Break­fast.</p>
    <p>The Mil­len­nium II pack­age, at a pro­mo­tional price of $35 a day, comes with ei­ther a main or two sides from its menu (above).</p>
    <p>My baked teriyaki sal­mon on a bed of mash and roasted veg­eta­bles was nicely caramelise­d, and sin­fully crisp lun­cheon meat fries are a crowd favourite.</p>
    <p>PERKS</p>
    <p>Other high­lights in­clude com­pli­men­tary park­ing, 30 pieces of A4 black and white print­ing, and a mail­ing ser­vice.</p>
    <p>The Mil­len­nium II pack­age in­cludes ac­cess to a size­able gym. Make ap­point­ments early.</p>
