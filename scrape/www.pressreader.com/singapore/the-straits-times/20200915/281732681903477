    <p>Coun­tries should not fall into the trap of “vac­cine na­tion­al­ism” and should in­stead work to­gether to fight the Covid-19 pan­demic, ex­perts said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Ms Ki­ran Mazum­dar-Shaw, ex­ec­u­tive chair­man of In­dian phar­ma­ceu­ti­cal gi­ant Bio­con, said there is an emerg­ing trend of “vac­cine na­tion­al­ism” as coun­tries line up to buy up the first stock of vac­cines when they be­come avail­able.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing a panel dis­cus­sion on the im­pact of the pan­demic on global trade and busi­nesses on the first day of the Sin­ga­pore Sum­mit, Ms Mazum­dar-Shaw said In­dia is in a “very strong po­si­tion” as the lead­ing vac­cine pro­ducer in the world. How­ever, the coun­try recog­nises it has an obli­ga­tion to share the vac­cine with the rest of the world, es­pe­cially de­vel­op­ing coun­tries, she added.</p>
    <p>There also needs to be a con­certed global ef­fort to eq­ui­tably share the vac­cines, she said.</p>
    <p>Ms Mazum­dar-Shaw said: “I think this ac­tu­ally is very sad, that the coun­tries don’t re­alise that this is a pan­demic that has ac­tu­ally af­fected the en­tire world.</p>
    <p>“It doesn’t know bor­ders, it doesn’t know l arge or af­flu­ent economies, it doesn’t dif­fer­en­ti­ate be­tween de­vel­op­ing and de­vel­oped world economies.”</p>
    <p>How­ever, it might take at least a year or a year and a half be­fore large pop­u­la­tions can be vac­ci­nated with a safe vac­cine, she added. “We should not be rush­ing vac­cines into the mar­ket with­out hav­ing enough safety data.”</p>
    <p>Ms Mazum­dar-Shaw urged coun­tries to move away from the sense of na­tion­al­ism and anti-glob­al­ism.</p>
    <p>“Let’s not for­get that the de­vel­op­ing world has ben­e­fited a lot from glob­al­i­sa­tion, and if you want a re­silient econ­omy, you have to get glob­al­i­sa­tion back on the ta­ble.”</p>
    <p>Fel­low pan­el­list Chen Dem­ing, China’s for­mer com­merce min­is­ter, said the Covid-19 pan­demic is a test for coun­tries to col­lab­o­rate and work to­gether.</p>
    <p>Dr Chen, who is pres­i­dent of the China As­so­ci­a­tion of En­ter­prises with For­eign In­vest­ment, said: “The big­gest prob­lem we are fac­ing is that the guid­ance, strate­gies and poli­cies of the big coun­tries are not aligned. This is re­ally not good.”</p>
    <p>He said he was in­jected with a China-made vac­cine, which had been tested for half a year. “There are 30,000 peo­ple that have been in­jected with it. So, with­out any side ef­fects, it will be launched in the win­ter of this year,” said Dr Chen.</p>
    <p>But he said China now does not have a huge enough caseload to carry out tests. Fol­low­ing re­quests from more than 10 coun­tries, it has been cul­ti­vat­ing, man­u­fac­tur­ing and testing vac­cines in coun­tries such as Mex­ico and Rus­sia.</p>
    <p>China, said Dr Chen, is will­ing to ex­pand pro­duc­tion of the vac­cine glob­ally and hopes that more coun­tries will do the same. Mak­ing it avail­able to un­der­de­vel­oped coun­tries should be a pri­or­ity, he added.</p>
    <p>Master­card chief ex­ec­u­tive Ajay Banga said it makes sense for coun­tries to take pre­cau­tion­ary mea­sures to safe­guard na­tional in­ter­ests in a crisis, but they can do so with­out be­com­ing pro­tec­tion­ist.</p>
    <p>The fourth and fi­nal mem­ber of the panel was Mr Jean-Pas­cal Tri­coire, chair­man and chief ex­ec­u­tive of Sch­nei­der Elec­tric. The dis­cus­sion was mod­er­ated by CNBC cor­re­spon­dent Nancy Hunger­ford.</p>
