    <p>The Covid-19 pan­demic has sent the con­struc­tion sec­tor into a tail­spin, but the im­pact on firms in the in­dus­try has been un­even.</p>
    <p>While some of the big­ger firms had the re­sources to tide over the cir­cuit breaker and pre­pare for the re­open­ing, the smaller firms are fac­ing the fi­nan­cial squeeze of not hav­ing enough work and yet hav­ing to pay their work­ers.</p>
    <p>Straits Con­struc­tion, with about 400 work­ers, started to make plans in April even as the cir­cuit breaker kicked in, which helped it to start work promptly at its six sites in July.</p>
    <p>Ex­ec­u­tive di­rec­tor and chief op­er­at­ing of­fi­cer Ken­neth Loo de­tailed the vast l ogis­tics in­volved from April, in­clud­ing con­vert­ing spa­ces to house work­ers on-site, im­ple­ment­ing zon­ing to pre­vent work­ers from mix­ing, and train­ing staff in safe man­age­ment pro­ce­dures.</p>
    <p>“Con­struc­tion work is like do­ing a jig­saw puz­zle. With­out any one piece, if there is any piece that is miss­ing, you can’t do much,” he said.</p>
    <p>He is now ex­plor­ing the pos­si­bil­ity of do­ing on-site test­ing, to save work­ers from hav­ing to go to re­gional cen­tres to be tested, and also pi­lot­ing the use of Blue­tooth con­tact-trac­ing to­kens.</p>
    <p>For 200-strong con­struc­tion com­pany Kori Hold­ings, the good news of work re­sump­tion was short­lived.</p>
    <p>On the week­end of Aug 22, it was an­nounced that two Covid-19 clus­ters were de­tected in Sungei Ten­gah Lodge and Home­s­tay Lodge in Kaki Bukit, where its work­ers were stay­ing.</p>
    <p>“Our pro­duc­tiv­ity was badly af­fected,” Mr Hooi Yu Koh, chief ex­ec­u­tive of Kori Hold­ings, told The Straits Times. “All of a sud­den, 20 per cent of our per­son­nel had to go back into quar­an­tine.”</p>
    <p>Sim­i­larly, about 70 of Mr Nixon Loh’s 280 work­ers had to be put on stay-home no­tice (SHN) af­ter the resur­gence of cases in Sungei Ten­gah Lodge, re­sult­ing in dis­rup­tions to work.</p>
    <p>Two of the four projects un­der Loh & Loh Con­struc­tion, where Mr Loh is gen­eral man­ager, had to be shut down, tak­ing three or four days be­fore work could re­sume.</p>
    <p>Al­though orig­i­nally sup­posed to end their stay-home pe­riod last Fri­day, his work­ers on SHN – who are cleared of Covid-19 – have had the pe­riod ex­tended to Sept 14. About 50 of them have also been trans­ferred out of the dorm to ho­tels.</p>
    <p>Like his work­ers, Mr Hooi was hope­ful things had changed for the bet­ter last month.</p>
    <p>By Aug 10, 90 per cent of his work­force had achieved the green code, cer­ti­fy­ing they were virus-free and had ful­filled the re­quire­ments set by the Build­ing and Con­struc­tion Au­thor­ity, Min­istry of Man­power (MOM) and the Health Min­istry.</p>
    <p>Com­plet­ing con­struc­tion jobs would mean his com­pany would be able to pay work­ers their salaries.</p>
    <p>Mr Hooi, 49, said of his work­ers: “They were dis­ap­pointed. If this keeps re­cur­ring, many are con­tem­plat­ing go­ing home.”</p>
    <p>Roughly 5 per cent of his work­ers have de­cided to re­turn home, while an­other 5 per cent are re­cov­er­ing from the coron­avirus.</p>
    <p>At a time like this, con­struc­tion com­pa­nies ap­pre­ci­ate all the help they can get from the au­thor­i­ties.</p>
    <p>The for­eign worker levy waiver and re­bate, as well as a one-off com­pen­sa­tion of $100 a day for re­turn­ing work­ers who were ini­tially put on SHN in ho­tels, were help­ful, said Mr Hooi, who re­quested more sup­port schemes for com­pa­nies</p>
    <p>Con­struc­tion work is like do­ing a jig­saw puz­zle. With­out any one piece, if there is any piece that is miss­ing, you can’t do much.</p>
    <p>MR KEN­NETH LOO, ex­ec­u­tive di­rec­tor and chief op­er­at­ing of­fi­cer of Straits Con­struc­tion.</p>
    <p>af­fected by the re­cent quar­an­tine or­der.</p>
    <p>But the fi­nan­cial bur­den con­tin­ues to be heavy, es­pe­cially for the in­dus­try’s smaller play­ers.</p>
    <p>A con­struc­tion com­pany owner shared his fi­nan­cial wor­ries, in­clud­ing his tus­sle with a dorm op­er­a­tor in the west, which wanted pay­ment de­spite him hav­ing re­housed 35 out of 50 of his work­ers in a ho­tel be­fore the cir­cuit breaker.</p>
    <p>“Whether you stay in the dorm or not, as long as your name is in the ten­ancy agree­ment, you still have to pay the rent,” said the man, who gave his name only as Mr Sal­man. “We have to keep pay­ing the dorm be­cause the ‘park­ing me­ter’ has not stopped.”</p>
    <p>He took is­sue with hav­ing to “pay two sides” for ac­com­mo­da­tion, and showed The Straits Times an MOM ad­vi­sory to em­ploy­ers with for­eign work­ers stay­ing in dor­mi­to­ries, dated May 7.</p>
    <p>While the min­istry had ad­vised em­ploy­ers to con­tinue pay­ing rent promptly to dorm op­er­a­tors ac­cord­ing to the rental con­tracts for work­ers housed in dor­mi­to­ries, the ad­vi­sory also ad­dressed em­ploy­ers in Mr Sal­man’s predica­ment.</p>
    <p>It stated: “Em­ploy­ers who had vol­un­tar­ily made their own hous­ing ar­range­ments for their work­ers be­fore move­ment at the dor­mi­to­ries was con­trolled, and are pay­ing for the new ac­com­mo­da­tion, may ter­mi­nate or sus­pend their ex­ist­ing rental con­tracts with the dor­mi­tory op­er­a­tors, in ac­cor­dance with their con­tracts with the dor­mi­tory op­er­a­tors.”</p>
    <p>Aside from his work­ers’ salaries, Mr Sal­man’s monthly bills in­clude $26,000 for 35 work­ers stay­ing in a ho­tel in Gey­lang, $47,500 for levy pay­ments for 50 work­ers and $15,000 in dorm rental for 50 work­ers.</p>
    <p>It comes as no sur­prise that some com­pa­nies have closed shop un­der such fi­nan­cial strain, said Mr Sal­man, who added he knows some peo­ple who have given up the trade.</p>
    <p>An­other con­struc­tion em­ployer, who wanted to be known only as Mr Wong, agreed, say­ing many of his friends are feel­ing the squeeze amid ris­ing costs.</p>
    <p>Sev­eral of them de­clined to speak</p>
    <p>to The Straits Times, cit­ing sen­si­tiv­i­ties as they were work­ing on gov­ern­ment-re­lated con­tracts.</p>
    <p>Rules against the mix­ing of work­ers work­ing on dif­fer­ent projects have been very dif­fi­cult for Mr Wong’s firm of only 20 work­ers.</p>
    <p>While he could pre­vi­ously ro­tate them more ef­fi­ciently to have more on a site at a time, he now needs to split his lim­ited man­power be­tween dif­fer­ent sites.</p>
    <p>“We are al­ready stretched and it’s hard for smaller con­trac­tors like us to on-board added man­power in a short time. So in the end, we can’t do much,” he said.</p>
    <p>Ac­com­mo­da­tion is an is­sue for Mr Wong too. While he used to be able to pay for the ex­act num­ber of beds he needed in a dorm, he now has to pay more to get a whole room be­cause his work­ers can­not share a room with those of an­other em­ployer.</p>
    <p>“I am at the mercy of the dorm op­er­a­tor,” Mr Wong said.</p>
    <p>A prob­lem that re­mains is com­mu­ni­ca­tion, sev­eral con­trac­tors said.</p>
    <p>Mr Loh said the au­thor­i­ties need to in­form em­ploy­ers when and why cer­tain de­ci­sions are made.</p>
    <p>“Noth­ing is made clear to us. Some­one tells us to­mor­row ‘you can’t go to work’, but we don’t know why. I can call and ask, but I am given the run-around,” he said.</p>
    <p>“We can’t give our clients a straight an­swer be­cause we have trou­ble get­ting a straight an­swer. There needs to be more open­ness and trans­parency, but un­for­tu­nately that hasn’t been the case.”</p>
    <p>Mr Loo, who heads a task force look­ing into the sec­tor’s res­tart at the Sin­ga­pore Con­trac­tors As­so­ci­a­tion, of which he is the im­me­di­ate past pres­i­dent, said the lack of in­for­ma­tion re­mains the big­gest chal­lenge for the in­dus­try.</p>
    <p>“Big play­ers may have the in­fra­struc­ture in place and know what is go­ing on, but smaller ones may not have that lux­ury. There is also a lot of hearsay and ba­sic gaps in knowl­edge,” he said.</p>
    <p>But there have been sig­nif­i­cant im­prove­ments in the flow of in­for­ma­tion since June, he said.</p>
    <p>Now that the sec­tor has restarted, the ques­tion is how sus­tain­able this res­tart will be, said Mr Loo.</p>
    <p>He warned of a “mul­ti­ply­ing ef­fect” should there be ca­su­al­ties in the in­dus­try, due to the closely in­ter­linked work of con­trac­tors and sub-con­trac­tors.</p>
    <p>“The in­dus­try’s fi­nan­cial health is quite drained. We came out from a pe­riod of down­turn, were just about to see some light, and then Covid-19 hap­pened,” he said.</p>
