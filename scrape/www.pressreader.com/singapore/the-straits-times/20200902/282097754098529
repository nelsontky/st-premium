    <p>Re­cently, there have been calls to be “more open” and to have a bet­ter frame­work to dis­cuss pol­i­tics, race and re­li­gion in Sin­ga­pore (Op­por­tu­ni­ties to give views with­out be­ing shouted down to be cre­ated, Aug 29).</p>
    <p>In one sense, this is a pos­i­tive devel­op­ment for the na­tion. But we should not for­get what is unique to Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>This unique­ness is some­thing that has made the city state a mul­tira­cial, multi-re­li­gious and mul­ti­cul­tural na­tion that is ad­mired by other na­tions, some of which have even viewed</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore as a mini-United Na­tions.</p>
    <p>At the same time, this unique­ness can put the city in a frag­ile, vul­ner­a­ble state if the dis­cus­sion of race, re­li­gion and other sen­si­tive is­sues is not done in a wise and ma­ture man­ner.</p>
    <p>We have seen such is­sues caus­ing ri­ots, anger, deep mis­un­der­stand­ings and po­lar­i­sa­tion in many so­ci­eties and coun­tries, and much of such dam­age is not eas­ily repara­ble.</p>
    <p>If cit­i­zens do not ap­proach such is­sues as Sin­ga­pore­ans, and in­stead do so as mem­bers of dif­fer­ent races, re­li­gions and cul­tures, the pos­si­bil­ity of things go­ing dras­ti­cally wrong is not far-fetched.</p>
    <p>I am con­cerned when­ever I browse so­cial me­dia and no­tice the angst in the lan­guage used, when­ever I per­ceive xeno­pho­bia on the rise es­pe­cially when one’s own af­fairs are threat­ened, and when­ever I no­tice a lack of un­der­stand­ing of the be­liefs, cul­ture and pe­cu­liar­i­ties of those who are dif­fer­ent.</p>
    <p>I feel rather dis­turbed by what I have read on so­cial me­dia, and re­alise that we may still be far from a sit­u­a­tion where we can de­bate and dis­cuss such is­sues in a calm and pos­i­tive man­ner.</p>
