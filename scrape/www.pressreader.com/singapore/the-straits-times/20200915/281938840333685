    <p>Mr Boris John­son’s plan to ex­plic­itly break in­ter­na­tional law has plunged Brexit back into crisis less than four months be­fore Britain is fi­nally due to leave the Euro­pean Union’s or­bit at the end of a tran­si­tion pe­riod, and puts trade talks with the bloc in peril. EU diplo­mats and of­fi­cials said the bloc could take le­gal ac­tion against Britain.</p>
    <p>LON­DON Bri­tish Prime Min­is­ter Boris John­son was try­ing to per­suade law­mak­ers in his party to vote yes­ter­day for a Bill that will break in­ter­na­tional law by breach­ing parts of the Brexit divorce deal and which has en­raged Brus­sels.</p>
    <p>The House of Com­mons will de­bate the In­ter­nal Mar­ket Bill, which the Euro­pean Union has de­manded Mr John­son scrap by the end of this month, in the lat­est episode of a four-year saga since Britain voted nar­rowly to leave the bloc.</p>
    <p>After the de­bate, law­mak­ers will de­cide if the Bill should go to the next stage.</p>
    <p>Mr John­son’s plan to ex­plic­itly break in­ter­na­tional law has plunged Brexit back into crisis less than four months be­fore Britain is fi­nally due to leave the EU’s or­bit at the end of a tran­si­tion pe­riod, and puts trade talks with the bloc in peril.</p>
    <p>EU diplo­mats and of­fi­cials said the bloc could take le­gal ac­tion against Britain, though there would be no res­o­lu­tion be­fore the end-ofyear dead­line for Britain’s full exit.</p>
    <p>The EU has ramped up prepa­ra­tions for a no-deal Brexit, which would be chaotic for busi­ness, mar­kets and nearly US$1 tril­lion (S$1.37 tril­lion) in an­nual trade.</p>
    <p>The gov­ern­ment has dis­missed an ul­ti­ma­tum from Brus­sels to scrap the main parts of the Bill by the end of this month.</p>
    <p>Mr John­son, who has a ma­jor­ity of 80 in the Lower House of Par­lia­ment, faces a grow­ing re­volt from some of his own law­mak­ers.</p>
    <p>All liv­ing for­mer Bri­tish prime min­is­ters have ex­pressed con­cern about his plan, as have many se­nior fig­ures in his Con­ser­va­tive Party.</p>
    <p>“When the Queen’s min­is­ter gives his word, on her be­half, it should be ax­iomatic that he will keep it, even if the con­se­quences are un­palat­able,” Mr John­son’s for­mer at­tor­ney-gen­eral Ge­of­frey Cox said in The Times news­pa­per. Mr Cox, who was sacked by Mr John­son in Fe­bru­ary, re­mains an in­flu­en­tial fig­ure with col­leagues.</p>
    <p>The pound fell 3 per cent last week on fears of a no-deal Brexit, but Gold­man Sachs said the odds of such a sce­nario were in fact lower than the mar­ket is im­ply­ing, so current ster­ling lev­els could be at­trac­tive to some in­vestors.</p>
    <p>Bri­tish min­is­ters say the Bill, which ex­plic­itly states that it could be in­con­sis­tent with a host of in­ter­na­tional laws, is in­tended to clar­ify am­bi­gu­i­ties – par­tic­u­larly over North­ern Ire­land – and act as a safe­guard in case trade talks fall.</p>
    <p>But some EU diplo­mats say they think Lon­don is play­ing a game of chicken, invit­ing the col­lapse of trade talks to ei­ther get the deal it wants or leave with­out a deal.</p>
    <p>After for­mer prime min­is­ters John Ma­jor, Tony Blair, Gor­don Brown and Theresa May scolded Mr John­son for con­sid­er­ing break­ing the law, an­other for­mer pre­mier, Mr David Cameron, also weighed in on the is­sue, say­ing he had “mis­giv­ings”.</p>
    <p>The EU says it can­not trust those who break agree­ments and that if the Bill is not ef­fec­tively scrapped, there will be no trade deal to cover ev­ery­thing from car parts to food.</p>
    <p>Ir­ish For­eign Min­is­ter Si­mon</p>
    <p>Coveney said Mr John­son’s Bill was most likely a ne­go­ti­at­ing tac­tic and a “thin” free trade deal was still pos­si­ble as there were just a few out­stand­ing is­sues.</p>
    <p>If, as ex­pected, the Bill is passed in its sec­ond read­ing yes­ter­day, there will be four more days of de­bate on its fine print – last­ing till next week. After the vote yes­ter­day, there were to be fur­ther votes on at­tempts to change the word­ing and mean­ing of the law, and a fi­nal vote to de­cide whether it goes to the next stage.</p>
