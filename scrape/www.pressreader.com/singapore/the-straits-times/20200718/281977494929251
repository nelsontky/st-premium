    <p>Nearly 14 mil­lion peo­ple have been sick­ened and over half a mil­lion peo­ple have died since Wuhan first con­firmed on Dec 31 that it was treat­ing dozens of Covid-19 cases. Yet, in the midst of the great­est chal­lenge to mankind since the Great De­pres­sion, the world’s most pow­er­ful na­tions are tar­get­ing each other rather than jointly at­tack­ing the virus. In the space of a week, United States Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump ended the spe­cial trad­ing sta­tus ac­corded to Hong Kong and signed a law pre­scrib­ing sanc­tions on Chi­nese of­fi­cials who crack down on dis­sent in the city. Sec­re­tary of State Mike Pom­peo raised stakes in the re­gion by de­scrib­ing Bei­jing’s claims to off­shore re­sources across most of the South China Sea as un­law­ful, and of­fered claimant states sup­port to en­force laws on ter­ri­to­rial rights. At­tor­ney-Gen­eral Wil­liam Barr warned US firms against ap­peas­ing the Chi­nese Com­mu­nist Party, and Fed­eral Bureau of In­ves­ti­ga­tion direc­tor Christo­pher Wray called China the great­est long-term threat to US eco­nomic and na­tional se­cu­rity.</p>
    <p>Bei­jing promised to re­tal­i­ate mea­sure for mea­sure as it presses on with an un­prece­dented ag­gres­sive “wolf war­rior” diplo­macy. It im­posed sanc­tions on four Amer­i­can law­mak­ers af­ter US sanc­tions on Chi­nese of­fi­cials al­legedly linked to the re­pres­sion of Uighurs. It also sanc­tioned US de­fence gi­ant Lock­heed Martin for arms sales to Tai­wan. Most im­por­tantly, Bei­jing has shown that it will not aban­don its pri­or­i­ties – the na­tional se­cu­rity law in Hong Kong, the pres­sure cam­paign in Xin­jiang and the groom­ing of Chi­nese firms to take on Amer­i­can dom­i­nance in high-tech.</p>
    <p>The re­ced­ing tide of cor­dial­ity be­tween the two has ex­posed treach­er­ous rocks for South-east Asia to nav­i­gate. The US can hardly ex­pect to pre­vent China’s rise and is fast reach­ing the thresh­old of costs it can im­pose on China, be­yond which lies the bar­ren path of de­cou­pling. A con­test for supremacy would have been painful at any time, but is es­pe­cially fraught at this time. First, for the added un­cer­tainty it imposes on a world cop­ing with a dis­ease for which it has no cure, vac­cine or im­mu­nity. Sec­ond, the strain is acute across the Pa­cific. China is on alert for eco­nomic and so­cial dis­ar­ray while the US is in a charged stretch of a bit­ter pres­i­den­tial elec­tion. Most glar­ingly, there is an ab­sence of plat­forms where the dead­lock can be bro­ken – whether the UN, the G-7 or G-20, these fo­rums also re­flect where their horns are locked.</p>
    <p>A con­test that can­not be won can be over­come by con­fronting facts – in the main that a multi-po­lar world is per­haps not just in­evitable but de­sir­able for the di­ver­sity it of­fers for prob­lem-solv­ing. With care­fully de­fined terms of en­gage­ment and shared ground, it would be eas­ier to tackle cli­mate change, in­come in­equal­ity, tech­no­log­i­cal up­heavals and the like. Those would be grand battles worth join­ing. It is pos­si­ble to do so even now.</p>
