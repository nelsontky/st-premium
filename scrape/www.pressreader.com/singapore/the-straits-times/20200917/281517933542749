    <p>NEW DELHI In­dia’s to­tal coro­n­avirus cases passed five mil­lion yes­ter­day, Health Min­istry data showed, as the pan­demic ex­tended its grip on the vast coun­try at an ever-faster rate.</p>
    <p>With its lat­est one mil­lion cases recorded in just 11 days, a world record, In­dia now has 5.02 mil­lion in­fec­tions. Only the United States has more, with 6.59 mil­lion.</p>
    <p>In­dia has for some time been record­ing the world’s big­gest daily jumps in cases, and yes­ter­day, the rise was just over 90,000 with a record 1,290 deaths. While it took 167 days to reach one mil­lion cases, the next mil­lion came in just 21 days, faster than the US and Brazil, said the Times of In­dia. Just 29 days later, In­dia be­came only the third coun­try after the US and Brazil to post four mil­lion in­fec­tions.</p>
    <p>In­dia passed Brazil ear­lier this month. Even so, and with In­dia now test­ing around a mil­lion peo­ple daily, many ex­perts say that this is not enough and that the true num­ber of in­fec­tions may be far higher.</p>
    <p>This has been borne out in sev­eral stud­ies in re­cent weeks mea­sur­ing an­ti­bod­ies against the virus among the cramped pop­u­la­tions of megac­i­ties New Delhi and Mum­bai.</p>
    <p>The In­dia Coun­cil for Med­i­cal Re­search, the coun­try’s lead pan­demic agency, said last week its sur­vey had sug­gested that al­ready in May, 6.5 mil­lion peo­ple were in­fected. The same goes for deaths – 82,066 as of yes­ter­day, fewer than half the US toll of 195,000 – with many deaths not prop­erly recorded even in nor­mal times.</p>
    <p>In­dia has one the world’s most poorly funded health­care sys­tems and the na­tion of 1.3 bil­lion peo­ple is home to some of the most densely pop­u­lated cities and towns.</p>
    <p>The sharp rise in cases is despite Prime Min­is­ter Naren­dra Modi’s gov­ern­ment im­pos­ing in late March one of the world’s strictest lock­downs, leav­ing tens of mil­lions of peo­ple in the in­for­mal labour mar­ket job­less al­most overnight.</p>
    <p>The l ock­down saw com­plete travel bans, shut­ting down of busi­nesses and fac­to­ries, and the flight of mil­lions from big cities to their vil­lages that ex­perts say caused the virus to spread to small towns.</p>
    <p>In­dia’s gross do­mes­tic prod­uct slumped nearly 24 per cent in the first quar­ter, one of the steep­est drops among ma­jor economies. The lock­down has been steadily eased even as in­fec­tions soar, with schools set to re­open for some classes on Mon­day – along with tourist hot spot the Taj Ma­hal.</p>
    <p>“Ini­tially, there was a fair amount of rigour in the lock­down, but sub­se­quently, there was some re­lax­ation before it was com­pletely lifted,” Dr K. Sri­nath Reddy, head of health char­ity the Pub­lic Health Foun­da­tion of In­dia, said. “It sent a wrong sig­nal to the peo­ple that pos­si­bly we have got things rea­son­ably un­der con­trol and now the econ­omy takes prece­dence. The virus is now in­fect­ing more peo­ple and pen­e­trat­ing deeper into smaller towns.”</p>
    <p>Rus­sia’s sov­er­eign wealth fund said yes­ter­day it will sup­ply In­dia’s Dr Reddy’s Lab­o­ra­to­ries with 100 mil­lion doses of the Sput­nik-V vac­cine against Covid-19 once it re­ceives reg­u­la­tory ap­proval in In­dia.</p>
    <p>The Rus­sian Di­rect In­vest­ment Fund said it had agreed to co­op­er­ate on clin­i­cal tri­als and the dis­tri­bu­tion of the vac­cine with the In­dian firm.</p>
