    <p>SAN AN­TO­NIO • San An­to­nio Spurs as­sis­tant coach Becky Ham­mon made his­tory on Wed­nes­day, be­com­ing the first woman to take charge of a Na­tional Basketball As­so­ci­a­tion (NBA) team when she took over af­ter long-serv­ing head coach Gregg Popovich was ejected.</p>
    <p>Popovich re­ceived two tech­ni­cal fouls with 3 min­utes and 56 sec­onds left in the se­cond quar­ter of the Spurs’ even­tual 121-107 de­feat by the vis­it­ing Los Angeles Lak­ers, lead­ing to Ham­mon step­ping in.</p>
    <p>“I did not walk into the arena think­ing I would be coach­ing tonight, but that’s the way things go and you roll with it, and I would have liked a different out­come,” the 43-year-old said.</p>
    <p>“Over­all, I would have loved to get a win tonight more than any­thing.”</p>
    <p>She did not know she would be put in charge un­til her boss made the call.</p>
    <p>“He of­fi­cially pointed at me,” she said. “That was it. He said, ‘You got ’em.’ That was it. Very Pop-like.”</p>
    <p>San An­to­nio trailed by 11 points when Popovich was tossed and while all the at­ten­tion was on Ham­mon, she in­sisted she could not have done it alone.</p>
    <p>“We all group to­gether, (as­sis­tant coaches) Will Hardy, Mitch Johnson, (like) ‘What can we do to help?’” she said. “It was a great team ef­fort, and they are in my ear giv­ing me sug­ges­tions and help­ing with sub­sti­tu­tions and what­not.</p>
    <p>“When Pop gets tossed, we all come to­gether and be­come kind of another team.”</p>
    <p>Ham­mon has been an as­sis­tant coach for the Spurs since Au­gust 2014, the first woman to be paid for that job in an of­fi­cial, full-time ca­pac­ity.</p>
    <p>The former guard had a 16-year play­ing ca­reer in the Women’s Na­tional Basketball As­so­ci­a­tion and while Le­Bron James spoiled her de­but on what was his 36th birthday, Ham­mon was still proud of her act­ing role.</p>
    <p>“Ob­vi­ously it’s a big deal, a sub­stan­tial mo­ment,” she said. “I’ve been a part of this or­gan­i­sa­tion. I got traded here in 2007, so I’ve been in San An­to­nio and part of the Spurs... or­gan­i­sa­tion with the (San An­to­nio) Stars and ev­ery­thing for 13 years.</p>
    <p>“So I have a lot of time in­vested, and they have a lot of time in­vested in me in build­ing me and get­ting me bet­ter.”</p>
    <p>James had a team-high 26 points as he set another NBA mile­stone, scor­ing dou­ble-digit points for the 1,000th straight game.</p>
    <p>On his lat­est achieve­ment, the Fi­nals Most Valu­able Player said: “I just try to live in the mo­ment and just try to con­tinue to get bet­ter with my game, try to get bet­ter with my team­mates and try to just max­imise when I’m on the floor.</p>
    <p>“I’ve been blessed to play the game that I love for 18 years and hope­fully, I can con­tinue to play at a high level.”</p>
