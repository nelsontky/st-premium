    <p>While phys­i­cal ral­lies were ab­sent dur­ing the hus­tings for the re­cently con­cluded gen­eral elec­tion, some politi­cians did not seem to need them.</p>
    <p>By the mid­point of the cam­paign, Progress Sin­ga­pore Party (PSP) chief Tan Cheng Bock was able to reach out to 12,000 fol­low­ers with each In­sta­gram post – thrice the ca­pac­ity of Cle­menti Sta­dium, where ral­lies for West Coast GRC were held in past elec­tions.</p>
    <p>The vet­eran politi­cian wooed younger vot­ers on­line by post­ing videos of him­self re­spond­ing to their at­tempts to ed­u­cate him on slang terms like “woke”.</p>
    <p>Dr Tan, who now has over 70,000 In­sta­gram fol­low­ers – more than lo­cal celebri­ties like TV per­son­al­ity Denise Keller and rap­per Sheikh Haikel – was among the politi­cians who thrived in what ex­perts have dubbed Sin­ga­pore’s “first truly In­ter­net elec­tion”.</p>
    <p>Po­lit­i­cal par­ties have tra­di­tion­ally re­lied on mass ral­lies to rouse the elec­torate and drum up sup­port. But this time, re­stric­tions on large gath­er­ings due to Covid-19 mea­sures saw the bat­tle for hearts and minds take place mostly in the dig­i­tal realm.</p>
    <p>Some ob­servers have ar­gued that an In­ter­net cam­paign ben­e­fits the op­po­si­tion par­ties, as it en­ables them to raise their pro­files quickly, af­ford­ably and widely.</p>
    <p>And even though the In­ter­net had been around dur­ing the past three or four elec­tions, it was the cur­rent so­cial dis­tanc­ing re­stric­tions that ne­ces­si­tated the use of on­line cam­paign­ing by par­ties and can­di­dates, said As­so­ciate Pro­fes­sor Eu­gene Tan from Sin­ga­pore Man­age­ment Univer­sity’s School of Law.</p>
    <p>“For many vot­ers, it was their only means of find­ing out in­for­ma­tion about par­ties, their can­di­dates and their pol­icy plat­forms,” he added.</p>
    <p>AN ON­LINE AD­VAN­TAGE?</p>
    <p>In lieu of phys­i­cal ral­lies, par­ties held talk shows – such as Straight Talk by the Peo­ple’s Ac­tion Party (PAP) and the Ham­mer Show by the Work­ers’ Party (WP).</p>
    <p>These pro­grammes al­lowed par­ties to en­gage with vot­ers on a more in­tel­lec­tual level than at phys­i­cal ral­lies, where vot­ers can be moved by emo­tion, noted Prof Tan.</p>
    <p>The Sin­ga­pore Demo­cratic Party and Peo­ples Voice also fea­tured can­di­dates’ speeches on their Face­book pages.</p>
    <p>All 11 par­ties in this year’s gen­eral elec­tion had their own e-ral­lies and par­tic­i­pated i n tele­vised con­stituency po­lit­i­cal broad­casts.</p>
    <p>Such ef­forts gave vot­ers a bet­ter sense of the par­ties’ ideas, said former Nom­i­nated Mem­ber of Par­lia­ment Lim Sun Sun, who is head of hu­man­i­ties, arts and so­cial sciences at the Sin­ga­pore Univer­sity of Tech­nol­ogy and De­sign.</p>
    <p>“Un­like pub­lic ral­lies where can­di­dates tend to en­gage in histri­on­ics and grand­stand­ing, the e-ral­lies and pub­lic broad­casts were calmer and more mea­sured, thereby en­abling vot­ers to con­cen­trate on the sub­stance of the is­sues and the strength of the ar­gu­ments,” she said.</p>
    <p>Dr Natalie Pang, a se­nior lec­turer in the com­mu­ni­ca­tions and new me­dia depart­ment at the Na­tional Univer­sity of Sin­ga­pore (NUS), said the on­line hus­tings gave vot­ers op­por­tu­ni­ties to hear from more par­ties and can­di­dates, com­pared with the past, when there was a limit to the num­ber of ral­lies they could at­tend.</p>
    <p>But the glut of con­tent also re­sulted in “in­for­ma­tion over­load”, said NUS so­ci­ol­o­gist Tan Ern Ser, with ne­ti­zens find­ing it hard to fol­low all the po­lit­i­cal dis­cus­sions on­line.</p>
    <p>Dr Felix Tan, an as­so­ciate lec­turer at SIM Global Ed­u­ca­tion, said po­lit­i­cal par­ties could have missed out on en­gag­ing some seg­ments of so­ci­ety, such as se­nior vot­ers who are tech-averse.</p>
    <p>Another dis­ad­van­tage of e-ral­lies in­stead of phys­i­cal ones is that par­ties lose op­por­tu­ni­ties to con­nect emo­tion­ally to vot­ers, said ex­perts.</p>
    <p>Par­ties also lose the op­por­tu­nity to raise funds by sell­ing mer­chan­dise or ap­peal­ing for do­na­tions at phys­i­cal ral­lies, said Prof Eu­gene Tan.</p>
    <p>The PAP was re­turned to power af­ter win­ning 83 of 93 seats with 61.24 per cent of the votes, down from the 69.9 per cent vote share it re­ceived in the 2015 Gen­eral Elec­tion.</p>
    <p>Not­with­stand­ing the vote swing against the rul­ing party, po­lit­i­cal watch­ers reckon the ab­sence of phys­i­cal ral­lies this time round could have hurt the per­for­mance of some op­po­si­tion par­ties at the polls.</p>
    <p>The set­ting of a phys­i­cal rally, which in­volves a can­di­date speak­ing be­fore a large crowd, has a more per­for­ma­tive el­e­ment than the more</p>
    <p>WHAT WORKED ON­LINE?</p>
    <p>Videos that ap­pealed to view­ers’ emo­tions and came across as be­ing authen­tic were some of the best forms of on­line cam­paign­ing ma­te­rial, and ex­perts said the WP did es­pe­cially well in this re­gard.</p>
    <p>NTU Ad­junct Pro­fes­sor Hong Hai, a PAP MP from 1988 to 1991, said the WP’s strat­egy – stress­ing the need to deny the PAP a blank cheque – rode on vot­ers’ griev­ances over is­sues rang­ing from in­equal­ity and Cen­tral Prov­i­dent Fund with­drawals to housing and the high cost of med­i­cal ser­vices.</p>
    <p>“The rul­ing party has an in­her­ent dis­ad­van­tage in such dis­courses as all it can rea­son­ably of­fer is more of the same, and that does not tug at the heart­strings,” he said.</p>
    <p>Prof Ang added that the WP was able to make up for the lack of the “per­for­ma­tive” el­e­ment of ral­lies by con­nect­ing to view­ers on­line.</p>
    <p>He cited a video by the WP where it in­tro­duced some of its new can­di­dates. The 15-sec­ond teaser, re­leased soon af­ter Par­lia­ment was dis­solved on June 23, fea­tured WP mem­bers look­ing at the cam­era while mak­ing move­ments like sit­ting down, smil­ing and ad­just­ing their ap­pear­ance. It has been shared more than 2,000 times.</p>
    <p>“(The video) is done in a very ca­sual way, it ap­peals to the av­er­age per­son,” Prof Ang said.</p>
    <p>Per­son­al­i­ties like PSP’s Dr Tan, WP’s Ni­cole Seah and Ja­mus Lim, as well as the PAP’s po­lit­i­cal of­fice-hold­ers helped par­ties drum up in­ter­est in their cam­paigns.</p>
    <p>Pro­fes­sor Lim Sun Sun noted that Ms Seah and Dr Tan used their In­sta­gram ac­counts to no­tify sup­port­ers about where they would be, and en­gaged them by re­shar­ing their posts or sto­ries, which built a “vir­tu­ous cy­cle of more sup­port­ers post­ing con­tent en­dors­ing them”.</p>
    <p>As for the PAP, Prime Min­is­ter Lee Hsien Loong’s strong Face­book fol­low­ing of more than 1.6 mil­lion users boosted the rul­ing party’s so­cial me­dia reach, said Prof Ang.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing the hus­tings, videos about PM Lee’s walk­a­bouts and the PAP’s out­reach ef­forts in var­i­ous con­stituen­cies were shared on the Prime Min­is­ter’s page. “Quite clearly, a lot of ef­fort had been put into (PM Lee’s) Face­book page, which is amaz­ingly well done,” said Prof Ang, not­ing that com­pared with those of other Sin­ga­porean politi­cians, the page has the largest fol­low­ing.</p>
    <p>But the PAP’s so­cial me­dia pres­ence, which was in line with the party’s “busi­ness-like and task-ori­ented” im­age, did not help it to stand out on­line, ex­perts said.</p>
    <p>Data from me­dia mon­i­tor­ing plat­form Melt­wa­ter, which tracked po­lit­i­cal par­ties’ pages from July 1 to 10, found that while the PAP made the most Face­book posts, it did not drive</p>
    <p>the most en­gage­ment to its page.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing this pe­riod, the PAP made 121 Face­book posts, and its party page saw about 131,000 in­ter­ac­tions – likes, com­ments, re­ac­tions and shares on Face­book.</p>
    <p>This is much less than the al­most 300,000 in­ter­ac­tions the WP had on its Face­book page that were largely derived from 78 posts. The PSP saw about 122,000 in­ter­ac­tions on its Face­book page, from a to­tal of 54 posts.</p>
    <p>WERE VOT­ERS SWAYED?</p>
    <p>While the WP far sur­passed the PAP in terms of the level of en­gage­ment on Face­book, ob­servers said such en­gage­ment does not nec­es­sar­ily trans­late into ac­tual votes.</p>
    <p>As­so­ciate Pro­fes­sor Ter­ence Lee, who re­searches Sin­ga­pore me­dia and pol­i­tics at Mur­doch Univer­sity, said such data sheds light only on whether a par­tic­u­lar per­son or post at­tracts view­er­ship or vi­ral­ity.</p>
    <p>A case in point is Re­form Party can­di­date Charles Yeo, who spawned a se­ries of vi­ral posts fol­low­ing his Man­darin speech dur­ing the con­stituency po­lit­i­cal broad­cast for Ang Mo Kio GRC.</p>
    <p>“You will find a lot of on­line ‘noise’ gen­er­ated, but very few would have gone on to cast a vote for him,” said Prof Lee.</p>
    <p>Data on so­cial me­dia en­gage­ment is also less mean­ing­ful when no fur­ther anal­y­sis is con­ducted to mea­sure whether these are pos­i­tive or neg­a­tive re­ac­tions, said Prof Ang.</p>
    <p>Rather, a party’s or can­di­date’s dom­i­nance on so­cial me­dia must first be based on some sub­stance – a pol­icy po­si­tion or strength of an ar­gu­ment – be­fore it can trans­late to pos­i­tive out­comes, added Prof Lee.</p>
    <p>Agree­ing, Dr Pang said whether so­cial me­dia posts trans­late into a vote de­pends on both the per­sua­sive­ness of the mes­sage as well as how ef­fec­tively it was put out.</p>
    <p>“The WP’s dom­i­nance on so­cial me­dia has been a com­bi­na­tion of the two,” she said, not­ing that the party was able to put out care­fully crafted, clear and co­her­ent mes­sag­ing in very well-de­signed forms.</p>
    <p>Prof Ang said that the­o­ret­i­cally, closed plat­forms used pre­dom­i­nantly for in­ter­per­sonal com­mu­ni­ca­tion, such as What­sApp and Tele­gram, may have a larger im­pact on the vote share than plat­forms that are more pub­lic, such as Face­book.</p>
    <p>He cited the two-step flow the­ory of com­mu­ni­ca­tion, which pro­poses that in­ter­per­sonal in­ter­ac­tion has a stronger ef­fect on shap­ing pub­lic opin­ion than mass me­dia.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to this the­ory, opin­ion lead­ers – peo­ple who are ac­tive me­dia users – pick up in­for­ma­tion from the me­dia, which is then in­ter­preted and dif­fused to less-ac­tive me­dia users. Such opin­ion lead­ers may ex­ist in fam­ily chat groups, for in­stance.</p>
    <p>This mer­its fur­ther study, said Prof Ang, given that the num­ber of users trans­mit­ting in­for­ma­tion on chan­nels like What­sApp has grown with the rise of smart­phones, com­pared with pre­vi­ous elec­tions.</p>
    <p>GEN­ER­AT­ING ON­LINE BUZZ</p>
    <p>Ad­junct Pro­fes­sor Kevin Tan, a law pro­fes­sor at NUS, said the lack of ral­lies fo­cused more at­ten­tion on the live tele­vi­sion de­bates on Me­di­a­corp, which raised the pro­file of WP’s Ja­mus Lim. Most peo­ple “couldn’t be both­ered” to watch such live de­bates in the past, he noted.</p>
    <p>Prof Lee made the point that many vot­ers were also re­ly­ing on videos, posts and mes­sages shared by their friends and fam­ily mem­bers, which do not reg­is­ter in Face­book in­ter­ac­tion data.</p>
    <p>Dr Pang also noted a rise in the num­ber of in­flu­encers, opin­ion lead­ers, civic groups and cit­i­zens us­ing dig­i­tal plat­forms to en­gage oth­ers dur­ing the elec­tion.</p>
    <p>They took the time and ef­fort to put out con­tent to ed­u­cate their peers on things like the group rep­re­sen­ta­tion con­stituency sys­tem and how it has evolved. “This gave cit­i­zens many op­por­tu­ni­ties to en­gage in di­a­logue and dis­cus­sions about the elec­tion,” she said.</p>
    <p>Other Sin­ga­pore­ans and pub­lic fig­ures with fol­low­ings on­line also voiced their po­lit­i­cal views on plat­forms such as Face­book and In­sta­gram. They in­cluded writer Amanda Lee Koe and NUS as­so­ciate pro­fes­sor Ben Leong, who wrote in his per­sonal ca­pac­ity.</p>
    <p>This may have had an im­pact on vot­ers, said Dr Pang, as peo­ple who fol­low these fig­ures would read or watch what they wrote or cre­ated and form an opin­ion.</p>
    <p>“The sense of au­then­tic­ity and trust­wor­thi­ness of a can­di­date (some­thing that vot­ers look for in po­lit­i­cal can­di­dates) is not some­thing that is sim­ply de­vel­oped by what a can­di­date says about him­self... but also what oth­ers, es­pe­cially pub­lic fig­ures and in­tel­lec­tu­als, say,” she said.</p>
    <p>Prof Lee agreed that such views may have an im­pact if vot­ers per­ceive that the writers con­trib­uted them en­tirely of their own vo­li­tion, and not un­der any di­rect or in­di­rect</p>
    <p>VALU­ABLE ON­LINE OUT­REACH</p>
    <p>The e-ral­lies and pub­lic broad­casts were ac­tu­ally valu­able. In an age where there is a high de­gree of au­di­ence frag­men­ta­tion, they helped to cre­ate a na­tional agenda that com­ple­mented and fo­cused on­line dis­cus­sions ’’ to an ex­tent.</p>
    <p>PRO­FES­SOR LIM SUN SUN, from the Sin­ga­pore Univer­sity of Tech­nol­ogy and De­sign.</p>
    <p>in­flu­ence. “(While) they are un­likely to sway any­one’s fi­nal de­ci­sion... they may play a part in af­firm­ing one’s po­lit­i­cal views.”</p>
    <p>Pro-PAP and pro-op­po­si­tion Face­book pages and groups kicked into high gear dur­ing the cam­paign pe­riod, shar­ing memes, ar­ti­cles and other con­tent to a grow­ing base of fol­low­ers.</p>
    <p>While such groups add to the “noise and heat”, they play a neg­li­gi­ble part in im­pact­ing elec­tion re­sults, said Prof Lee. “It seems quite ap­par­ent that these sites largely preach to the con­verted, so their im­pact is lim­ited to hav­ing their fol­low­ers at­tempt­ing to in­flu­ence their own con­tacts by shar­ing them to oth­ers.”</p>
    <p>E-CAM­PAIGN­ING HERE TO STAY</p>
    <p>While the elec­tion is over, the var­i­ous forms of on­line cam­paign­ing are here to stay, said ex­perts.</p>
    <p>Prof Eu­gene Tan called this elec­tion a “rev­e­la­tion” in il­lus­trat­ing how po­lit­i­cal par­ties can ex­ploit the In­ter­net and so­cial me­dia.</p>
    <p>“The ques­tion now is: If the next elec­tion has none of these re­stric­tions, will par­ties go back to what they are fa­mil­iar with? I sus­pect there will be a mix of both on­line and off­line cam­paign­ing, but we’ll have to see whether in­no­va­tions from this GE are one-off or im­ple­mented in fu­ture GEs,” he said.</p>
    <p>For many cit­i­zens, pol­i­tics will no longer just be some­thing that they par­tic­i­pate in once ev­ery five years at the bal­lot box, said Dr Pang.</p>
    <p>Even ahead of the next elec­tion, par­ties will need to be open and en­gage vot­ers in an authen­tic man­ner on so­cial me­dia, and be in­ter­ac­tive and re­spon­sive to ground sen­ti­ments, she said.</p>
    <p>As­so­ciate Pro­fes­sor Netina Tan from Canada’s Mc­Mas­ter Univer­sity said that in pre­par­ing for fu­ture on­line elec­tion cam­paigns, can­di­dates and par­ties will need to learn to be timely in their re­sponses and not sound de­fen­sive in re­fut­ing false­hoods and on­line ac­cu­sa­tions.</p>
    <p>Prof Lim said: “The e-ral­lies and pub­lic broad­casts were ac­tu­ally valu­able. In an age where there is a high de­gree of au­di­ence frag­men­ta­tion, they helped to cre­ate a na­tional agenda that com­ple­mented and fo­cused on­line dis­cus­sions to an ex­tent.”</p>
