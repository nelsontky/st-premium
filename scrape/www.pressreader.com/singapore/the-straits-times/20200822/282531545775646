    <p>It may look mild, but the S60 T8 Plug-in Hy­brid is the quick­est pro­duc­tion Volvo yet.</p>
    <p>The mid-sized saloon takes merely 4.4 sec­onds to reach 100kmh, which makes it quicker than even the 545e xDrive Saloon – BMW’s new­est and most pow­er­ful plug-in hy­brid (4.7 sec­onds).</p>
    <p>It also beats the Porsche Panam­era (5.7 sec­onds), Maserati Ghi­bli (5.5 sec­onds) and Mercedes-AMG C43 Coupe (4.7 sec­onds) – all pow­ered by en­gines far big­ger than the S60 T8’s 2-litre.</p>
    <p>The Volvo has a few things in its favour. One, its engine is both tur­boand su­per-charged to make 315bhp and 400Nm of seam­less torque.</p>
    <p>Two, it has a rear-mounted elec­tric mo­tor which makes 65kW (87bhp) at 7,000rpm and 240Nm from 3,000rpm. This mo­tor is pow­ered by an 11.6kWh lithium bat­tery which can be recharged via a wall socket. To­gether, they send 402bhp and 640Nm to all four wheels to max­imise trac­tion.</p>
    <p>It is the same driv­e­train found in the Volvo XC60 T8 re­viewed here in Fe­bru­ary. But be­ing heav­ier and taller, the XC60 sport util­ity ve­hi­cle takes 5.3 sec­onds to reach 100kmh.</p>
    <p>All well and good. But does the S60 T8 feel like a 4.4-sec­ond car at the wheel? Most of the time, no.</p>
    <p>The car is un­doubt­edly ca­pa­ble. With so much power and torque, and no gaps in its power band, it re­sponds to your right foot swiftly and pre­dictably. In any given sit­u­a­tion, you are never go­ing to think, “Gee, I wish there was more power”, though you might go, “Where’s the sound and fury?”</p>
    <p>A 4.4-sec­ond car has to be more than that, though. It has to be head­spin­ning, pulse-rais­ing and, some­times, sweat-in­duc­ing. In the Volvo, you get this only when you raise the revs in a hurry by prac­ti­cally floor­ing the pedal.</p>
    <p>The car’s mas­sive out­put some­times trans­lates into some­thing other than for­ward thrust. Driven hard, it ex­hibits strange torque steer, which is rare for an all-wheel-drive (AWD).</p>
    <p>The Volvo, how­ever, has an elec­tronic AWD sys­tem – with its more pow­er­ful engine driv­ing the front axle and a far less pow­er­ful mo­tor driv­ing the rear. So, even in AWD mode, it is pre­dom­i­nantly a fron­twheel-drive (FWD).</p>
    <p>But driven sanely, the S60 T8 is re­ward­ing. Its steer­ing is lin­ear, weighty, pre­cise and for­giv­ing, with a de­cent mea­sure of feed­back. It is quite un­like the light, airy steer­ing you of­ten find in Volvo cars – even if its turn-in is a bit loose.</p>
    <p>The sus­pen­sion is com­fort­bi­ased, yet will al­low fast sweep­ers to be ex­e­cuted with con­fi­dence.</p>
    <p>As a plug-in hy­brid, the car has a stated fuel con­sump­tion of 2 litres/ 100km – if you keep its bat­tery charged via a wall socket when­ever you can.</p>
    <p>The test-car’s bat­tery was de­pleted be­fore the first day was up and I did not plug it in.</p>
    <p>Over three days, it av­er­aged 7.9 litres/100km – which is still fairly de­cent for such a pow­er­ful model.</p>
    <p>The car is highly equipped, with pre­mium fea­tures such as adap­tive cruise con­trol with lane as­sist, a 360-de­gree cam­era and a nice­sound­ing Har­man Kar­don hi-fi.</p>
    <p>On the whole, it is a com­pe­tent and thor­oughly en­joy­able driv­ing ma­chine, even if it does not quite feel like a big, burly 4.4-sec­ond car.</p>
