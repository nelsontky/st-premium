    <p>A one-year-old boy and 29-yearold Rus­sian mixed mar­tial arts (MMA) fighter were among the 16 new coron­avirus cases con­firmed yes­ter­day, tak­ing Sin­ga­pore’s to­tal to 58,341.</p>
    <p>The boy is a short-term visit pass holder who re­turned from Indonesia, the Min­istry of Health (MOH) said last night.</p>
    <p>He showed symp­toms last Fri­day, and was con­firmed pos­i­tive on Mon­day.</p>
    <p>The MMA fighter is also a short­term visit pass holder who trav­elled from Rus­sia to take part in a sport­ing event here.</p>
    <p>There were 13 other im­ported cases com­pris­ing three Sin­ga­pore­ans, two short-term visit pass hold­ers, five work per­mit hold­ers, a de­pen­dant’s pass holder, a stu­dent’s pass holder and a work pass holder.</p>
    <p>The Sin­ga­pore­ans re­turned from In­dia, the United Kingdom and the</p>
    <p>United States, while the work pass and work per­mit hold­ers, who are em­ployed in Sin­ga­pore, came from Brazil, In­dia and Indonesia.</p>
    <p>All the im­ported cases had been placed on stay-home no­tice upon ar­rival in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>There were no new Covid-19 pa­tients in the com­mu­nity yes­ter­day, but there was one case in a work­ers’ dor­mi­tory, which was de­tected when he took a Covid-19 pre-de­par­ture test in prepa­ra­tion for his re­turn to China.</p>
    <p>MOH said he was asymp­to­matic, and his pre­vi­ous tests from ros­tered rou­tine test­ing had been neg­a­tive.</p>
    <p>His close con­tacts at the dorm and work­place have been placed un­der quar­an­tine as a pre­cau­tion­ary mea­sure, it added.</p>
    <p>Over­all, the num­ber of new cases in the com­mu­nity has re­mained low, with no new cases in the past week.</p>
    <p>With 23 cases dis­charged yes­ter­day, 58,218 pa­tients have fully re­cov­ered from the dis­ease.</p>
    <p>A to­tal of 25 pa­tients re­main in hos­pi­tal, with none in in­ten­sive care, while 54 pa­tients are still re­cu­per­at­ing in com­mu­nity fa­cil­i­ties.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore has had 29 deaths from Covid-19 com­pli­ca­tions, while 15 who tested pos­i­tive have died of other causes.</p>
