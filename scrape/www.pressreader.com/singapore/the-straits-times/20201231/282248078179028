    <p>A to­tal of $159.1 mil­lion from the Med­i­cal En­dow­ment Fund (MediFund) was used to help needy Sin­ga­pore­ans with their med­i­cal bills in the last fi­nan­cial year, $2.6 mil­lion more than in the pre­vi­ous year.</p>
    <p>More than 1.2 mil­lion suc­cess­ful ap­pli­ca­tions were made, the Min­istry of Health said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>MediFund helps needy Sin­ga­pore­ans who are un­able to af­ford their med­i­cal bills after govern­ment sub­si­dies, in­sur­ance and MediSave. More tar­geted as­sis­tance for the el­derly and chil­dren is pro­vided through MediFund Sil­ver and Ju­nior, re­spec­tively.</p>
    <p>The rise in funds used came even as the num­ber of ap­proved ap­pli­ca­tions dipped by 1.9 per cent, fol­low­ing a fall in the to­tal num­ber of ap­pli­ca­tions, com­pared with FY2018.</p>
    <p>A to­tal of $36.2 mil­lion was pro­vided to pa­tients in in­ter­me­di­ate and long-term care fa­cil­i­ties, up from $32.3 mil­lion in FY2018.</p>
    <p>These are fa­cil­i­ties for those who need fur­ther care after be­ing dis­charged from an acute hospi­tal, as well as se­niors who may be frail and need some­one to watch over them or help them with their daily needs.</p>
    <p>The amount pro­vided to pa­tients in public hos­pi­tals and in­sti­tu­tions dropped from $124.2 mil­lion to $122.8 mil­lion.</p>
    <p>The av­er­age amount of MediFund as­sis­tance pro­vided was about $900 per i npa­tient treat­ment, and about $90 per out­pa­tient treat­ment.</p>
    <p>At the end of FY2019 on March 31, about $4.64 bil­lion re­mained in MediFund, a slight dip from about $4.65 bil­lion in FY2018.</p>
    <p>The Health Min­istry said: “MediFund en­sures that no Sin­ga­porean will be de­nied ba­sic med­i­cal care due to in­abil­ity to pay.”</p>
