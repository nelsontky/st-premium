    <p>Movies such as The Wolf Of Wall Street and The Big Short that show char­ac­ters nav­i­gat­ing the fi­nance in­dus­try helped spark en­tre­pre­neur Jimmy Tey’s in­ter­est in in­vest­ing.</p>
    <p>The 23-year-old clean­ing com­pany direc­tor also re­called how he had al­ways wanted to in­crease his as­sets and have more dis­pos­able in­come through div­i­dends.</p>
    <p>He dug deeper into the world of fi­nance by read­ing fo­rums and searching for bro­ker­age ac­counts with the low­est fees. He made his first in­vest­ment, in a penny stock, when he was 19.</p>
    <p>Since then, he has in­vested about $200,000 in stocks as well as in­vest­ment and en­dow­ment plans, draw­ing from his sav­ings, busi­ness in­come and salary.</p>
    <p>“A big bulk of my in­vest­ments are equities with high risk, and my safety net is en­dow­ment plans with gen­er­ally lower risk,” said Mr Tey, who is also an AIA fi­nan­cial ser­vices con­sul­tant.</p>
    <p>“I fig­ured I am young and this is the time when I can re­ally take on more risk as I have no li­a­bil­i­ties at the mo­ment.”</p>
    <p>But it has not all been smooth sail­ing for Mr Tey, who has had losses in for­eign ex­change trad­ing and penny stocks.</p>
    <p>“I credit those losses to my greed, and since then, I’ve stayed away from things that I don’t un­der­stand. But that doesn’t mean I stop try­ing to learn more. We have to be ready to ac­cept losses and have a steady mind­set.”</p>
    <p>Af­ter grad­u­at­ing from Repub­lic Polytech­nic with a diploma in in­te­grated events man­age­ment, Mr Tey founded clean­ing com­pany Au­thor­i­ties Fa­cil­i­ties Man­age­ment, which of­fers ser­vices such as up­hol­stery clean­ing, dis­in­fec­tion and mar­ble pol­ish­ing.</p>
    <p>He also has a stake in a com­pany that dis­trib­utes mo­bile phone cases and ac­ces­sories, and will launch a fash­ion com­pany soon.</p>
    <p>His jour­ney as an en­tre­pre­neur has taught him the im­por­tance of plan­ning his fi­nances.</p>
    <p>He keeps to a bud­get­ing rule where he al­lo­cates 20 per cent for emer­gency funds and funds for the next five years, 30 per cent for needs and wants, and 50 per cent to­wards a di­ver­si­fied in­vest­ment port­fo­lio.</p>
    <p>Mr Tey said: “In­vest­ing re­quires a lot of home­work and even af­ter (that), it is not 100 per cent guar­an­teed. It is a longterm game, and we have to be pa­tient and un­der­stand what our end goal is.”</p>
