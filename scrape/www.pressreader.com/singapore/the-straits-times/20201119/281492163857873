    <p>After an eight-month hia­tus, week­end war­riors like Ke­sa­van An­na­malay will fi­nally get the op­por­tu­nity to step onto a school field for a kick­about.</p>
    <p>Na­tional agency Sport Sin­ga­pore (SportSG) and the Min­istry of Ed­u­ca­tion (MOE) yes­ter­day an­nounced the re­sump­tion of se­lected sports fa­cil­i­ties un­der the Dual-Use Scheme (DUS) for the public dur­ing the year-end school hol­i­days from Satur­day to Dec 27.</p>
    <p>Public use of all school sports fa­cil­i­ties un­der DUS, which in­clude in­door sports halls and fields, was sus­pended in March be­cause of the Covid-19 pan­demic.</p>
    <p>“Even though we are still not al­lowed to play a full game of 11-aside foot­ball (due to safe man­age­ment mea­sures), I’m still look­ing for­ward to just be­ing back on a pitch and hav­ing drills in small groups,” said Mr An­na­malay, who has al­ready made a book­ing at a field at a school in the west.</p>
    <p>The 33-year-old se­nior en­gi­neer added: “Over­all, it’s a good sign that the au­thor­i­ties are open­ing up more fa­cil­i­ties for sport and hope­fully, with ev­ery­one do­ing their part, we can see a full re­turn to nor­mal ac­tiv­i­ties soon.”</p>
    <p>From Satur­day, mem­bers of the public will be able to ac­cess 50 charge­able fields and 119 in­door sports halls lo­cated in 135 pri­mary and sec­ondary schools. Book­ings can be made through the Ac­tiveSG app.</p>
    <p>The 169 fa­cil­i­ties that will re­open ac­count for less than 60 per cent of the 290 DUS fa­cil­i­ties, which also in­clude free-to-play fields and had a pre-pan­demic take-up rate of</p>
    <p>about 80 per cent.</p>
    <p>SportSG and MOE said they would re­view the fea­si­bil­ity of ex­tend­ing public use of DUS fa­cil­i­ties be­yond Dec 27.</p>
    <p>Mr Sng Hock Lin, chief of Ac­tiveSG, said the in­tent of re­open­ing some fa­cil­i­ties was to of­fer more spa­ces for the public to ex­er­cise while en­sur­ing that the safety of play­ers, as well as that of school stu­dents and staff, is not com­pro­mised.</p>
    <p>“While we want to en­cour­age ev­ery­one to con­tinue lead­ing an ac­tive life­style, we urge all to do so safely and re­spon­si­bly, and to re­main vig­i­lant,” he added.</p>
    <p>Some of these mea­sures in­clude SafeEn­try and tem­per­a­ture tak­ing, en­sur­ing no in­ter­min­gling and cross-play­ing be­tween dif­fer­ent groups, and for the fa­cil­ity hirer to be present dur­ing the time of play.</p>
    <p>For users of bad­minton DUS fa­cil­i­ties, a max­i­mum of only five per­sons – in­clud­ing an in­struc­tor or coach – are al­lowed per court, with only four play­ers al­lowed on each court at any one time.</p>
    <p>For other court-based sports – net­ball, vol­ley­ball, bas­ket­ball and floor­ball – a max­i­mum of five per­sons per court are al­lowed, while a max­i­mum of 50 per­sons are al­lowed on each field, with a 3m dis­tanc­ing be­tween groups of five.</p>
    <p>For foot­ball, only two groups of five are al­lowed on the field at any one time.</p>
    <p>A safe dis­tanc­ing am­bas­sador and a fa­cil­ity war­den will be sta­tioned at each fa­cil­ity to en­sure that play­ers ob­serve the re­quired mea­sures.</p>
    <p>SportSG will take strong ac­tion against in­di­vid­u­als who fail to com­ply with safe man­age­ment mea­sures, in­clud­ing bar­ring them from the use of all DUS and Ac­tiveSG fa­cil­i­ties. Public use of the af­fected fa­cil­ity may also be sus­pended as a re­sult of such non-com­pli­ance.</p>
    <p>SportSG also an­nounced yes­ter­day that con­tact sports, in­clud­ing com­bat sports such as wrestling and jiu-jitsu that have pro­longed phys­i­cal con­tact, can re­sume as long as ac­tiv­i­ties are kept to a group of five. Only tran­sient con­tact was al­lowed pre­vi­ously, with rugby tack­les and grap­pling in mixed mar­tial arts dis­al­lowed.</p>
    <p>Na­tional sambo ath­lete Nazri Su­tari, who won the gold medal at last year’s SEA Games, said the eas­ing of re­stric­tions will mean there are “a lot more things I can im­part to my stu­dents”.</p>
    <p>The 30-year-old, who coaches at Im­pact MMA and Jagsport, is hope­ful that class sizes can be in­creased next, adding that the gyms’ classes are of­ten “maxed out”.</p>
