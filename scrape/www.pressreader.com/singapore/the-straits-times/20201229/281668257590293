    <p>In­done­sia yes­ter­day de­cided to im­pose a tem­po­rary ban on all for­eign­ers vis­it­ing the coun­try, in a bid to stem the spread of new coro­n­avirus strains.</p>
    <p>The new re­stric­tion will run from Jan 1 to 14, with ex­cep­tions given only to those of min­is­te­rial rank and above, said For­eign Min­is­ter Retno Mar­sudi in a brief­ing yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The coun­try has been shut to most for­eign trav­ellers since April, al­low­ing only some ex­emp­tions for busi­ness trav­ellers.</p>
    <p>Other coun­tries have also stepped up bor­der con­trols to tackle the coro­n­avirus vari­ant which first sur­faced in Bri­tain and South Africa, and is said to be as much as 70 per cent more trans­mis­si­ble than other ex­ist­ing strains.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, In­done­sia also re­cently an­nounced it will soon in­tro­duce a new rapid test which can an­a­lyse breath sam­ples and de­tect Covid-19 in­fec­tion within a few min­utes.</p>
    <p>The test is set to use the breathal­yser GeNose C19, de­vel­oped by re­searchers at Yo­gyakarta-based Gad­jah Mada Univer­sity.</p>
    <p>Pro­fes­sor Kuwat Triyana, who leads the re­search team, said last Satur­day that 100 breathal­y­sers would be ini­tially dis­trib­uted for mas­sive screen­ing in pub­lic places such as air­ports, train sta­tions and hos­pi­tals, after the Health Min­istry granted a dis­tri­bu­tion per­mit for their use last Thurs­day.</p>
    <p>A sin­gle test takes only three min­utes, which in­cludes the col­lec­tion of breath sam­ples, and the re­sult is ready in just two min­utes.</p>
    <p>It costs be­tween 15,000 ru­piah and 25,000 ru­piah (S$1.40 and S$2.35).</p>
    <p>“Each one of the 100 units from the first batch to be re­leased is ex­pected to be able to carry out 120 tests, or cover a to­tal of 12,000 peo­ple per day,” Prof Kuwat said in a state­ment posted on the univer­sity’s web­site.</p>
    <p>The re­search team has tar­geted to pro­duce 10,000 breathal­y­sers by the end of Fe­bru­ary, to test 1.2 mil­lion peo­ple each day.</p>
    <p>“With the ca­pa­bil­ity to test as many peo­ple as pos­si­ble, hope­fully we can find peo­ple who have con­tracted Covid-19 with­out any symp­toms and iso­late or treat them im­me­di­ately to break the chain of in­fec­tions,” he added.</p>
    <p>A con­sor­tium of five com­pa­nies has com­mit­ted to sup­port­ing the pro­duc­tion and dis­tri­bu­tion of the di­ag­nos­tic tools, whose de­vel­op­ment was funded by the State In­tel­li­gence Agency and the Re­search and Tech­nol­ogy Min­istry.</p>
    <p>In­done­sia, which an­nounced its first two Covid-19 cases in early March, has strug­gled to achieve ad­e­quate test­ing to de­tect in­fec­tions on the ground.</p>
    <p>Poly­merase chain re­ac­tion (PCR) tests, set by the World Health Or­gan­i­sa­tion (WHO) as the stan­dard test­ing for di­ag­no­sis, are costly and can ex­ceed two mil­lion ru­piah.</p>
    <p>The much cheaper rapid an­ti­body tests have been widely used for mas­sive screen­ing, and antigen tests were re­cently re­quired for travel. Those test­ing pos­i­tive are ad­vised to take the PCR tests.</p>
    <p>Dr Windhu Purnomo, an epi­demi­ol­o­gist from Surabaya-based Air­langga Univer­sity, told The Straits Times that the breath anal­y­sis is use­ful only for mass screen­ing and should not be used to make a di­ag­no­sis.</p>
    <p>As at yes­ter­day, In­done­sia had recorded 719,219 Covid-19 in­fec­tions and 21,452 deaths, the high­est in South-east Asia.</p>
    <p>Ex­perts say the coun­try needs to widen test­ing to help re­duce in­fec­tions.</p>
    <p>“Be­low the sur­face, there are still a lot of un­de­tected in­fec­tions,” said Dr Windhu.</p>
