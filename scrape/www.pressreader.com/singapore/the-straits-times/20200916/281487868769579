    <p>Sin­ga­pore Air­lines (SIA) is let­ting go of all its cadet pi­lots and cabin crew trainees, al­though about half will get to com­plete their train­ing first. The air­line has also stopped tak­ing in new re­cruits, The Straits Times un­der­stands.</p>
    <p>There are now more than 400 flight and cabin crew trainees at var­i­ous stages of their course.</p>
    <p>Those asked to abort train­ing are mainly for­eign­ers.</p>
    <p>A spokesman for the air­line said: “SIA is com­mit­ted to sup­port­ing them (those be­ing re­tained) through their train­ing pro­gramme.”</p>
    <p>But it will not be able to keep them be­yond that point, due to ex­cess man­power amid the Covid-19 pan­demic that has plunged the avi­a­tion sec­tor into its dark­est hour.</p>
    <p>SIA, how­ever, said that it will be open to hir­ing them should de­mand for air travel re­turn to pre-Covid-19 lev­els.</p>
    <p>It takes over two years and costs about $250,000 to train one pi­lot. The pro­gramme for cabin crew lasts less than three months.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore Air­lines (SIA) has let go about half of its cadet pi­lots and cabin crew trainees as it con­tin­ues to down­size its work­force.</p>
    <p>The rest will have to leave after their train­ing is com­pleted.</p>
    <p>The Straits Times un­der­stands that there are more than 400 staff at var­i­ous stages of train­ing.</p>
    <p>Those who had to abort their train­ing are mainly for­eign­ers.</p>
    <p>A spokesman for the air­line said of the de­ci­sion to al­low the rest to con­tinue: “SIA is com­mit­ted to sup­port­ing them through their train­ing pro­gramme.”</p>
    <p>It takes over two years and costs about $250,000 to train one pi­lot.</p>
    <p>The pro­gramme for cabin crew lasts less than three months.</p>
    <p>How­ever, the air­line will not be able to keep them after that due to the “current sur­plus staff num­bers”, said the spokesman.</p>
    <p>The SIA Group has about 10,000 cabin crew mem­bers and about 3,200 pi­lots.</p>
    <p>Re­tained cadet pi­lots who need to com­plete the over­seas seg­ment of their train­ing will be put on no­pay leave un­til SIA is able to safely re­sume this seg­ment of the train­ing pro­gramme, the spokesman said.</p>
    <p>“Cadet pi­lots will be re­leased after they have com­pleted their ba­sic train­ing pro­gramme, which in­cludes the over­seas seg­ment, due to the current sur­plus staff num­bers.”</p>
    <p>SIA will be open to hir­ing them should there be a de­mand for cabin crew or ju­nior pi­lots when the de­mand for air travel re­turns to preCovid-19 lev­els, the air­line added.</p>
    <p>In its lat­est and most dras­tic mea­sure to deal with op­er­a­tions bat­tered by the Covid-19 pan­demic, the SIA Group said last week it would cut around 4,300 po­si­tions.</p>
    <p>This in­cludes let­ting go about 2,400 staff.</p>
    <p>Re­trenched work­ers started re­ceiv­ing their pink slips on Mon­day.</p>
    <p>They will con­tinue to re­ceive their salaries un­til Dec 15, and will also re­tain their med­i­cal and other ben­e­fits un­til then.</p>
    <p>In ad­di­tion, each af­fected em­ployee will be paid in lieu of the no­tice pe­riod in their employment con­tract. This can be up to three months’ salary.</p>
    <p>Those who have been in ser­vice for two years or more will re­ceive one month of pay for ev­ery year of ser­vice, capped at 25 months.</p>
    <p>The re­trench­ment ex­er­cise is be­ing con­ducted at the SIA Train­ing</p>
    <p>Cen­tre near Changi Air­port for Sin­ga­pore-based staff.</p>
    <p>A se­vere down­turn in the avi­a­tion in­dus­try has forced some air­lines out of busi­ness, while oth­ers have had to cut costs dras­ti­cally.</p>
    <p>The In­ter­na­tional Air Trans­port As­so­ci­a­tion (Iata) has warned that air pas­sen­ger num­bers are un­likely to re­turn to pre-Covid-19 lev­els till 2024.</p>
    <p>Global pas­sen­ger num­bers this year are ex­pected to de­cline by 55 per cent com­pared with last year, worse than the 46 per cent fore­cast in April, Iata has said.</p>
    <p>SIA re­ported a $1.12 bil­lion net loss in the quar­ter ended June 30, its largest quar­terly loss on record, as de­mand plum­meted amid Covid-19 travel re­stric­tions.</p>
    <p>Group rev­enue plunged 79.3 per cent to $851 mil­lion year on year, while ex­pen­di­ture dropped 51.6 per cent to $1.89 bil­lion.</p>
