    <p>NEW YORK • Moderna is plan­ning to price its coron­avirus vac­cine at US$50 to US$60 per course, at least US$11 (S$15) more than an­other vac­cine from Pfizer and BioNTech, the Fi­nan­cial Times has re­ported, cit­ing un­named sources.</p>
    <p>Moderna’s pro­posed price for a two-dose course sold to gov­ern­ments com­pares with US$39 for two doses un­der a deal that Pfizer and Ger­man part­ner BioNTech struck with the US gov­ern­ment, ac­cord­ing to the re­port on Tues­day.</p>
    <p>In­dus­try an­a­lysts said Pfizer and BioNTech’s US$2 bil­lion deal to cover 50 mil­lion pa­tients, which is con­tin­gent on an ap­prov­able prod­uct, would likely pres­sure other man­u­fac­tur­ers to set sim­i­lar prices.</p>
    <p>Moderna’s pro­posed price would ap­ply to the United States and other high-in­come coun­tries, ac­cord­ing to the re­port. A Moderna spokesman said the com­pany was in dis­cus­sions with gov­ern­ments about po­ten­tial sup­ply of the vac­cine, called mRNA-1273, but did not pro­vide any de­tails on pric­ing “given the con­fi­den­tial na­ture of the dis­cus­sions and con­tracts”.</p>
    <p>The fi­nal price for Moderna’s Covid-19 vac­cine has yet to be de­ter­mined, said a per­son fa­mil­iar with the dis­cus­sions.</p>
    <p>Pfizer, Moderna and Merck & Co have said they plan to sell their vac­cines at a profit, while some drug­mak­ers, in­clud­ing John­son & John­son, have an­nounced plans to price their vac­cines on a not-for­profit ba­sis.</p>
    <p>As­traZeneca agreed to pro­vide the US with 300 mil­lion doses of its po­ten­tial vac­cine in ex­change for US$1.2 bil­lion in upfront fund­ing, which works out to US$4 per dose.</p>
    <p>The US gov­ern­ment has pro­vided Moderna with nearly US$1 bil­lion in fund­ing to sup­port its re­search and de­vel­op­ment ef­forts for its po­ten­tial Covid-19 vac­cine.</p>
    <p>The fund­ing is part of Op­er­a­tion Warp Speed, an ini­tia­tive by the Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion to has­ten the</p>
    <p>A Moderna spokesman said the com­pany was in dis­cus­sions with gov­ern­ments about po­ten­tial sup­ply of the vac­cine, called mRNA-1273, but did not pro­vide any de­tails on pric­ing “given the con­fi­den­tial na­ture of the dis­cus­sions and con­tracts”.</p>
    <p>pro­duc­tion of an in­oc­u­la­tion for Covid-19, which has so far killed around 660,000 peo­ple world­wide.</p>
    <p>A study in the New Eng­land Journal of Medicine said on Tues­day that Moderna’s Covid-19 vac­cine in­duced a ro­bust im­mune re­sponse and pre­vented the coron­avirus from repli­cat­ing in the noses and lungs of mon­keys.</p>
    <p>The fact that the vac­cine pre­vented the virus from repli­cat­ing in the nose is seen as par­tic­u­larly cru­cial in pre­vent­ing it from be­ing trans­mit­ted on­wards to oth­ers.</p>
    <p>The same out­come did not oc­cur when the Univer­sity of Ox­ford’s vac­cine was tested on mon­keys, though that vac­cine did pre­vent the virus from en­ter­ing the an­i­mals’ lungs and mak­ing them very sick.</p>
    <p>In the Moderna animal study, three groups of eight rhe­sus macaques re­ceived ei­ther a placebo or the vac­cine at two dif­fer­ent dose lev­els – 10 mi­cro­grams and 100 mi­cro­grams.</p>
    <p>All vac­ci­nated macaques pro­duced high lev­els of neu­tral­is­ing an­ti­bod­ies that at­tack a part of the Sars-CoV-2 virus used to in­vade cells. No­tably, mon­keys re­ceiv­ing both dose lev­els pro­duced these an­ti­bod­ies at lev­els higher than those found in hu­mans who have re­cov­ered from Covid-19.</p>
    <p>The authors re­ported that the vac­cine also in­duced the pro­duc­tion of a dif­fer­ent im­mune cell known as T-cells that may have helped boost the over­all re­sponse.</p>
