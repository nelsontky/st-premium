    <p>Stu­dents in sec­ondary schools and ju­nior col­leges will have greater ac­cess to ca­reer guid­ance from next year to help them bet­ter han­dle the fast-chang­ing ed­u­ca­tion and jobs land­scape.</p>
    <p>This comes amid the Covid-19 pan­demic, which has led to greater un­cer­tain­ties in ca­reer prospects and job op­por­tu­ni­ties, es­pe­cially for fresh grad­u­ates.</p>
    <p>The ju­nior col­leges will each have one ed­u­ca­tion and ca­reer guid­ance coun­sel­lor, while there will be one coun­sel­lor for ev­ery two sec­ondary schools.</p>
    <p>This is up from a ra­tio of one coun­sel­lor for four schools cur­rently, Ed­u­ca­tion Min­is­ter Lawrence Wong said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>He was speak­ing in a video ad­dressed to ed­u­ca­tors in com­mem­o­ra­tion of Teach­ers’ Day to­day.</p>
    <p>The num­ber of stu­dent wel­fare of­fi­cers in schools will also be dou­bled to bet­ter help vul­ner­a­ble stu­dents. They sup­port teach­ers and work with other school staff and com­mu­nity part­ners to strengthen the safety net, as well as ad­dress bar­ri­ers to school at­ten­dance and learn­ing for at-risk stu­dents.</p>
    <p>The in­crease in ca­reer coun­sel­lors and wel­fare of­fi­cers will be im­ple­mented in phases, start­ing from Jan­uary. Staff in both these roles fall un­der the um­brella of al­lied ed­u­ca­tors.</p>
    <p>To pro­vide the dif­fer­ent groups of al­lied ed­u­ca­tors with more op­por­tu­ni­ties for pro­gres­sion, the Min­istry of Ed­u­ca­tion (MOE) said it will also in­crease the num­ber of mid­dle- and se­nior-level po­si­tions.</p>
    <p>This is also to nur­ture var­i­ous do­main ex­per­tise and strengthen pro</p>
    <p>fes­sional lead­er­ship.</p>
    <p>Over the next few years, there will also be “a sig­nif­i­cant num­ber” of master teach­ers who will be posted to schools, the min­istry an­nounced.</p>
    <p>Master teach­ers spend their time on pol­icy and co­or­di­na­tion work at the na­tional level and are now pri­mar­ily based in MOE head­quar­ters, though they also spend time on school attachment­s to keep up with class prac­tices and developmen­ts on the ground.</p>
    <p>They “fos­ter a teacher-led cul­ture of pro­fes­sional ex­cel­lence in our</p>
    <p>TO­WARDS A COM­MON GOAL</p>
    <p>teach­ing fra­ter­nity”, said MOE.</p>
    <p>Mr Wong said: “(Master teach­ers) play a crit­i­cal role in shar­ing ef­fec­tive teach­ing prac­tices in the class­room, pro­to­typ­ing new teach­ing method­olo­gies and sup­port­ing pol­icy and pro­gram­matic work re­lated to teach­ing and learn­ing at the na­tional level.”</p>
    <p>He noted that the Covid-19 pan­demic has clearly shown the im­por­tance of be­ing able to adapt and in­no­vate ped­a­gog­i­cal prac­tices.</p>
    <p>The even­tual goal is to post more than 1 00 master teach­ers to schools to teach classes on a sus­tained ba­sis, said Mr Wong.</p>
    <p>They will spend most of their time on teach­ing in the class­rooms, co-plan­ning and co-teach­ing lessons with fel­low teach­ers, and lead­ing pro­fes­sional de­vel­op­ment com­mit­tees within the school and also at clus­ter and zonal lev­els.</p>
    <p>Mr Wong said the ini­tia­tive is “a sig­nif­i­cant move, sig­nalling our com­mit­ment to strengthen the teach­ing track, and our con­tin­ued in­vest­ments to cre­ate a qual­ity teach­ing work­force as the back­bone of our ed­u­ca­tion sys­tem”.</p>
    <p>These teach­ers will be posted with ef­fect from Jan­uary, and the num­bers will be ramped up over time.</p>
    <p>Mr Wong also noted that with the im­ple­men­ta­tion of blended learn­ing – a mix of class­room and dig­i­tal learn­ing – and the Na­tional Dig­i­tal Lit­er­acy Pro­gramme, schools’ in­for­ma­tion and com­mu­ni­ca­tions tech­nol­ogy (ICT) ca­pa­bil­i­ties will need strength­en­ing.</p>
    <p>Such ca­pa­bil­i­ties will be recog­nised as a core part of schools’ ad­min­is­tra­tive teams, and MOE will en­hance ca­reer de­vel­op­ment op­por­tu­ni­ties for ICT ad­min­is­tra­tive staff, with chances for some to con­trib­ute at the clus­ter level.</p>
    <p>The min­istry will also in­crease the ICT part­ner-to-school ra­tio and pro­vide a team to sup­port the roll-out of per­sonal learn­ing de­vices for stu­dents, which will start for sec­ondary school stu­dents next year.</p>
    <p>Mr Wong said: “Our schools to­day are mul­ti­fac­eted com­mu­ni­ties be­cause that is what it takes to nur­ture our stu­dents holis­ti­cally.</p>
    <p>“It takes peo­ple with dif­fer­ent skills – teach­ers, al­lied ed­u­ca­tors, ed­u­ca­tion and ca­reer guid­ance coun­sel­lors – all work­ing to­gether to­wards a com­mon goal.”</p>
