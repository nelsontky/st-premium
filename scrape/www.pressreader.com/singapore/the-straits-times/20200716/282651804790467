    <p>Home-grown jazz stal­wart Jeremy Mon­teiro de­scribes him­self as an “a*****e” in his early days in the mu­sic in­dus­try.</p>
    <p>“When I was young, be­ing one of the lead­ers and play­ing re­ally well and get­ting all the prime work, I was quite ar­ro­gant. I re­mem­ber be­ing very dis­mis­sive,” the mu­si­cian, com­poser and ed­u­ca­tor tells The Straits Times.</p>
    <p>Age – he turned 60 last month – has mel­lowed him a lot over the years. He is more ac­cept­ing and much more for­giv­ing when other mu­si­cians make mis­takes.</p>
    <p>“Even though as a mu­si­cian, you do re­tain cer­tain nar­cis­sis­tic ten­den­cies, I’ve be­come less self-cen­tred,” he says.</p>
    <p>On Sun­day, the ex­ec­u­tive di­rec­tor and mu­sic di­rec­tor of Jazz As­so­ci­a­tion (Sin­ga­pore) will cel­e­brate his six decades with an on­line con­cert.</p>
    <p>Re­flect­ing his rep­u­ta­tion as a team player, the gig will fea­ture ac­com­plished guest mu­si­cians, from lo­cal singers like Nathan Hartono to in­ter­na­tion­ally renowned names such as multi-Grammy-win­ning mu­si­cian Wyn­ton Marsalis.</p>
    <p>While the con­cert is free, view­ers are en­cour­aged to do­nate to the non-profit Jazz As­so­ci­a­tion (Sin­ga­pore).</p>
    <p>In the Sin­ga­pore mu­sic land­scape, no one has made an im­pact quite like Mon­teiro, who started out in the 1970s play­ing in lo­cal clubs.</p>
    <p>Am­bas­sador-at-large Pro­fes­sor Tommy Koh, the found­ing chair­man of the Na­tional Arts Coun­cil from 1991 to 1996, calls Mon­teiro “a na­tional trea­sure”.</p>
    <p>“He is a world-class jazz pi­anist,” says Prof Koh, who is also a pa­tron of Jazz As­so­ci­a­tion (Sin­ga­pore). “He has per­formed with some of the big­gest stars of the jazz world. Be­cause of Jeremy, Sin­ga­pore has earned a place in the world of jazz.”</p>
    <p>Here are six ways Mon­teiro has made his mark on Sin­ga­pore mu­sic in the last four decades.</p>
    <p>1</p>
    <p>HE IS ONE OF SIN­GA­PORE’S MOST PRO­LIFIC RECORD­ING ARTISTS AND LIVE PER­FORM­ERS</p>
    <p>In a pro­fes­sional mu­sic ca­reer that started in 1976, Mon­teiro has recorded 45 jazz al­bums.</p>
    <p>From the 1970s to the early 1990s, he was a highly sought-af­ter ses­sion pi­anist who played in over 300 al­bums by pop­u­lar re­gional acts such as Matthew & The Man­darins, Anita Sarawak, Al­l­ey­cats and Sudirman Ar­shad.</p>
    <p>“From 1977 to 1986, I was pretty much liv­ing in the stu­dio,” he re­calls.</p>
    <p>As a live per­former, he has played in over 3,000 gigs. These in­clude head­line per­for­mances at lo­cal venues such as the Es­planade Con­cert Hall, as well as key­board du­ties for iconic Amer­i­can duo Si­mon & Gar­funkel’s 1993 con­cert at the Sin­ga­pore In­door Sta­dium.</p>
    <p>In 1988, he be­came the first South-east Asian mu­si­cian to play at the pres­ti­gious Mon­treux Jazz Fes­ti­val in Switzer­land, lead­ing a band that in­cluded Gram­my­win­ning Amer­i­can mu­si­cians Eldee Young and Redd Holt. The set re­ceived a three-minute stand­ing ova­tion and was tele­vised in many coun­tries.</p>
    <p>2 HE WAS ONE OF THE YOUNGEST ARTISTS TO RE­CEIVE SIN­GA­PORE’S HIGH­EST ARTS AC­CO­LADE</p>
    <p>Mon­teiro was 42 when he was con­ferred the Cul­tural Medal­lion in 2002, one of the youngest artists here to re­ceive the award from the Na­tional Arts Coun­cil (NAC).</p>
    <p>He has since done stints at the NAC as a coun­cil mem­ber.</p>
    <p>The Cul­tural Medal­lion was an im­por­tant mile­stone in his jour­ney as an artist, he says .</p>
    <p>“It was a great shot in the arm and pro­pelled me to work harder and pro­duce more shows, record more al­bums and play more mu­sic in clubs and con­cert halls.”</p>
    <p>3 HE COM­POSED AND WORKED ON NA­TIONAL DAY FAVOURITES AND POP­U­LAR AD­VER­TIS­ING JINGLES</p>
    <p>Mon­teiro com­posed what is still one of the most pop­u­lar na­tional songs that is sung every Na­tional Day: One Peo­ple, One Na­tion, One Sin­ga­pore. The lyrics to the 1990 song was writ­ten by cre­ative di­rec­tor Jim Aitchi­son.</p>
    <p>“I was also mu­sic di­rec­tor and ar­ranger for three other na­tional songs – Stand Up For Sin­ga­pore (1984), Count On Me, Sin­ga­pore (1986) and We Are Sin­ga­pore (1987),” he says.</p>
    <p>From 1981 to 1991, he also com­posed count­less ad­ver­tis­ing jingles for ma­jor com­pa­nies in­clud­ing Coca-Cola, McDon­ald’s and KFC.</p>
    <p>4 HE IS A CHAM­PION OF COMPOSERS AND SONG­WRIT­ERS’ RIGHTS</p>
    <p>Mon­teiro is one of the co-founders of the Composers and Au­thors So­ci­ety of Sin­ga­pore (Com­pass), a non­profit started in 1988 to pro­tect and ad­min­is­ter the rights of mu­sic composers, au­thors and pub­lish­ers.</p>
    <p>It col­lects $25 mil­lion in roy­al­ties each year in Sin­ga­pore and dis­trib­utes 85 per cent of that amount to composers, lyri­cists, pub­lish­ers and other rights own­ers.</p>
    <p>He sits on the Com­pass board of di­rec­tors.</p>
    <p>5 HE IS DED­I­CATED TO NURTURING YOUNG SIN­GA­PORE MU­SIC TAL­ENT</p>
    <p>Through his work at the Jazz As­so­ci­a­tion (Sin­ga­pore), young jazz tal­ent are given the chance to hone their chops with their more ex­pe­ri­enced peers.</p>
    <p>Prof Koh notes: “Jeremy is very gen­er­ous in men­tor­ing young jazz mu­si­cians. As a re­sult, the Jazz As­so­ci­a­tion (Sin­ga­pore) has two or­ches­tras – a se­nior or­ches­tra and a young or­ches­tra. Be­cause of Jeremy’s fore­sight and hard work, the fu­ture of jazz in Sin­ga­pore is as­sured.”</p>
    <p>Mon­teiro sits on schol­ar­ship com­mit­tees at Com­pass, NAC and Jazz As­so­ci­a­tion (Sin­ga­pore), help­ing young mu­si­cians get sup­port for their stud­ies.</p>
    <p>He is also the vis­it­ing pro­fes­sor at Lasalle Col­lege of the Arts and the Univer­sity of West Lon­don’s Lon­don Col­lege Of Mu­sic.</p>
    <p>6</p>
    <p>HE HAS HELPED RAISE AN ES­TI­MATED $9 MIL­LION FOR CHAR­ITY</p>
    <p>Mon­teiro of­ten uses his mu­sic to raise funds for char­ity.</p>
    <p>In 2010, for in­stance, a char­ity din­ner show to mark his 50th birth­day raised a lit­tle over $1 mil­lion for the Com­mu­nity Chest.</p>
    <p>It is es­ti­mated that the char­ity events he has been in­volved with through­out his mu­sic ca­reer has raised a to­tal of $9 mil­lion.</p>
    <p>View­ers of his 60th birth­day con­cert are en­cour­aged to do­nate to Jazz As­so­ci­a­tion (Sin­ga­pore).</p>
    <p>He is also one of the mu­si­cians fea­tured in ChildAid 2020, a fundrais­ing con­cert for The Straits Times School Pocket Money Fund and The Busi­ness Times Bud­ding Artists Fund that pre­miered yes­ter­day. It can be watched on The Straits Times and The Busi­ness Times web­sites, as well as their re­spec­tive YouTube and Face­book chan­nels.</p>
