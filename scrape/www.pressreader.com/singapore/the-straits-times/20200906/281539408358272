    <p>Just as cities were open­ing up again, new out­breaks have led to re­stric­tions that have dealt a fresh blow to Asia’s nightlife scene. For­eign cor­re­spon­dents Chang May Choon, Claire Huang, El­iz­a­beth Law, Nadi­rah H. Rodzi and Ro­hini Mo­han re­port from Seoul, Hong Kong, Bei­jing, Kuala Lumpur and Ban­ga­lore. SEOUL: RESTAU­RANT STILL SUF­FER­ING AMID NEW CURBS</p>
    <p>Once a core part of the thriv­ing Itae­won nightlife in central Seoul, with queue times of up to 11/ hours,</p>
    <p>2 Mex­i­can-Korean restau­rant bar Vatos Ur­ban Tacos has been whipped once and again by the coro­n­avirus out­break, which has kept peo­ple away since Fe­bru­ary.</p>
    <p>An Itae­won club clus­ter in May turned the area into a ghost town.</p>
    <p>All of the city’s 2,154 clubs were or­dered shut and only al­lowed to re­open with re­stric­tions in late June.</p>
    <p>Just as cus­tomers were start­ing to re­turn in July, as lo­cal in­fec­tion num­bers dropped to sin­gle dig­its, Vatos took another blow – a 9pm dine-in re­stric­tion im­posed last Sun­day to com­bat a sud­den surge in cases.</p>
    <p>South Korea re­ported 21,010 to­tal cases as of yes­ter­day. About one quar­ter is from last month alone.</p>
    <p>“It seems like Covid-19 is a big bad bully who knocks you down and won’t let you get back up,” said Vatos co-founder Juweon Kim.</p>
    <p>To min­imise cost, he had to cut 60 per cent to 70 per cent of his staff and shorten op­er­at­ing hours.</p>
    <p>“A lot of restau­rants closed but we forced our­selves to stay open, it’s like a form of mar­ket­ing, say­ing Vatos is al­ways open, at least for de­liv­ery,” Mr Kim said. He added that de­liv­ery sales went up 20 per cent to 30 per cent but it was not enough to make up for the 85 per cent to 90 per cent drop in dine-in rev­enue, half of which is from the bar.</p>
    <p>Mr Kim said the pan­demic made them take a hard look at their busi­ness model and find new chan­nels of rev­enue, such as mak­ing Vatos­branded home meal kits to sell on­line or at marts and con­ve­nience stores. “Covid-19 is a game changer, the new norm,” he said.</p>
    <p>But there are also “op­por­tu­ni­ties in tur­moil”, he added, not­ing that the com­pany was able to se­cure a prime lo­ca­tion in the glitzy Gang­nam area for its fourth branch. Itae­won is not the only one hurt. Nightlife hubs across Asia took a bashing as the pan­demic spun out of con­trol af­ter first be­ing de­tected in the Chi­nese city of Wuhan last De­cem­ber.</p>
    <p>Glob­ally, there are over 26 mil­lion cases and more than 878,000 deaths were re­ported.</p>
    <p>In­dia is the worst-hit in Asia and third most af­fected glob­ally af­ter the United States and Brazil.</p>
    <p>In­dia re­ported four mil­lion cases and over 69,000 deaths, ac­cord­ing to data col­lec­tion site Worl­dome­ter.</p>
    <p>BAN­GA­LORE: BEER TAKE­AWAYS HELP SOME STAY AFLOAT</p>
    <p>Ban­ga­lore, In­dia’s pub city, has seen nightlife die out since March, when the govern­ment im­posed a na­tion­wide lockdown.</p>
    <p>Busi­ness crashed and many of the city’s 1,330 bars had to close.</p>
    <p>A few nim­bly changed their ways of work­ing to sur­vive, stay­ing open with fewer staff, ne­go­ti­at­ing lower rents, and chang­ing menus.</p>
    <p>The city’s 57 mi­cro­brew­eries lob­bied the lo­cal govern­ment to al­low beer take­aways – once for­bid­den due to com­plex laws.</p>
    <p>“With din­ing in and beer take­aways, we are able to stay afloat,” said Mr Sibi Venkataraj­u, co­founder of Toit, Ban­ga­lore’s old­est mi­cro­brew­ery.</p>
    <p>Once a vi­brant pub with no stand­ing room on Satur­days, Toit has had only a quar­ter of its usual cus­tomers in the past six months.</p>
    <p>The In­dian govern­ment has al­lowed bars to serve al­co­hol since last Tues­day, but bar own­ers say the older group that usu­ally drinks more is still re­luc­tant to come out.</p>
    <p>“A younger than usual crowd is turn­ing up. They get some food and a cou­ple of mock­tails and sit for two to three hours,” said Mr Venkataraj­u.</p>
    <p>“The lockdown has made peo­ple re­ally want to spend time with friends, I guess.”</p>
    <p>KUALA LUMPUR: MAK­ING DO WITH FOOD, AL­CO­HOL SALES</p>
    <p>The num­bers are also sober­ing in Malaysia’s nightlife scene.</p>
    <p>Nearly one in ev­ery five en­ter­tain­ment out­lets has shut down and al­most 50 per cent of work­ers lost their jobs af­ter the govern­ment</p>
    <p>im­posed a lockdown in March to curb the spread of the virus.</p>
    <p>Malaysia has re­ported 9,391 cases and 128 deaths in to­tal.</p>
    <p>Most sec­tors of the econ­omy were re­opened in May, but only clubs, pubs and bars that serve food along­side al­co­hol were al­lowed to re­sume op­er­a­tions un­til mid­night from June. About half of the 6,600 nightspots na­tion­wide serve only al­co­hol.</p>
    <p>Mr Cher Ng, ex­ec­u­tive di­rec­tor of TREC, which houses clubs like Zouk KL and Iron Fairies, said his firm is fo­cused on serv­ing food and al­co­hol to weather the Covid-19 storm.</p>
    <p>“We can’t do DJs or live bands, nor can we play mu­sic too loud be­cause we are op­er­at­ing un­der the pre­text of a restau­rant bar,” he said.</p>
    <p>“This has caused our rev­enue to plum­met around 75 per cent.”</p>
    <p>As a land­lord, TREC is also help­ing its ten­ants by of­fer­ing rental re­bates and free park­ing.</p>
    <p>“We are also help­ing some ten­ants with li­cence ap­pli­ca­tions to con­vert their cur­rent spa­ces into a restau­rant bar or cafe,” said Mr Ng.</p>
    <p>HONG KONG: ROLLING WITH THE PUNCHES</p>
    <p>In Hong Kong, food and bev­er­age play­ers have adapted quickly to roll with the punches.</p>
    <p>When the govern­ment or­dered bars and pubs to close again in midJuly as the third wave hit, rock-an­droll bar co-owner Beck­aly Franks and her team quickly brought in a cof­fee ma­chine and came up with ideas for snacks in or­der to trans­form The Pon­tiac, a 700 sq ft pop­u­lar wa­ter­ing hole in Central, into a cafe – in less than 48 hours.</p>
    <p>Dine-in ser­vices at eater­ies were, at the time, al­lowed only be­tween 5am and 6pm. “So we closed the doors (as a pub) and opened up at 11am and threw that day­time cafe vibe party un­til 6pm,” she said.</p>
    <p>Dine-in hours have been extended to 10pm from Fri­day – as the third wave ta­pers off.</p>
    <p>Bars, pubs and night­clubs were first forced to close in late March through April dur­ing the sec­ond wave of the pan­demic. Pent-up de­mand soared when they re­opened in early May, throw­ing these es­tab­lish­ments a much-needed life­line.</p>
    <p>Hong Kong has so far recorded more than 4,800 con­firmed cases, in­clud­ing over 90 deaths.</p>
    <p>BEI­JING: NIGHTSPOTS COM­ING BACK TO LIFE</p>
    <p>In Bei­jing, the nightlife in­dus­try is slowly com­ing back to life af­ter be­ing hit by a com­bi­na­tion of the pan­demic and the clo­sure of a pop­u­lar club­bing area.</p>
    <p>San­l­i­tun, a pop­u­lar nightlife des­ti­na­tion, was hit es­pe­cially hard.</p>
    <p>Af­ter be­ing al­lowed to re­open in May, it was forced to shut again dur­ing the sec­ond wave. While there have been no hard num­bers, in­dus­try play­ers said an es­ti­mated 30 per cent to 50 per cent of bars have shut be­cause of the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Gas­tro­bar owner Joe Hou, whose clien­tele was mostly expatriate­s, had to try to at­tract new lo­cal cus­tomers by ex­pand­ing the menu to in­clude items such as rice dishes.</p>
    <p>“We’ve had to cut our floor staff, so now, I work at the bar while my wife is the server; if not there was sim­ply no way we could sur­vive,” he said.</p>
    <p>China has re­ported 90,507 cases and 4,735 deaths in to­tal.</p>
    <p>With the sit­u­a­tion grad­u­ally eas­ing – Bei­jing has not seen any new cases in nearly a month – par­ty­go­ers are start­ing to reap­pear.</p>
    <p>In club One Third, the only in­di­ca­tion of an on­go­ing pan­demic was masks hang­ing off the el­bows of pa­trons danc­ing the night away.</p>
    <p>“It’s been nearly nine months since my friends and I have had a night out like that be­cause we were all wor­ried be­fore,” said Ms Shelly Feng, a 25-year-old who works in fi­nance.</p>
    <p>“Now that ev­ery­thing is start­ing to look bet­ter, we’re mak­ing up for lost time,” she said with a laugh.</p>
