    <p>SIA also has to work on a trans­for­ma­tion pro­gramme to eke out max­i­mum ef­fi­cien­cies and cost re­duc­tions. In short, it has to be­come a leaner, meaner and a more tech­no­log­i­cally driven com­pany. How­ever, it has to do this with­out los­ing what has es­sen­tially made it a great way to fly.</p>
    <p>Al­most a month ago, I wrote a col­umn high­light­ing the acute dis­ad­van­tages Sin­ga­pore Air­lines (SIA) faces, and how the shut­down in global air travel would force the car­rier to down­size.</p>
    <p>Well, the right­siz­ing has al­ready be­gun.</p>
    <p>The com­pany has an­nounced it is shed­ding around 4,300 jobs in all for now. Af­ter tak­ing into ac­count 1,900 po­si­tions lost via re­cruit­ment freeze, nat­u­ral at­tri­tion and vol­un­tary de­par­tures, about 2,400 staff in Sin­ga­pore and abroad could be let go. The vast ma­jor­ity of these will be for­eign cabin crew.</p>
    <p>Ne­go­ti­a­tions with unions – es­pe­cially SIA’s pi­lots union Alpa-S – will de­ter­mine how many pi­lots will be re­leased. If the pi­lots’ union is will­ing to ac­cept dras­tic pay cuts, most Sin­ga­porean pi­lots un­der the age of 62 could still re­tain their jobs.</p>
    <p>SIA, SilkAir and Scoot had over 21,000 em­ploy­ees at the end of the pre­vi­ous fi­nan­cial year. They in­clude 3,273 pi­lots and 10,932 cabin crew. The cur­rent round of cuts will bring the air­line staffing down to just over 17,000.</p>
    <p>At least 6,000 of SIA’s em­ploy­ees have been on no-pay leave since Fe­bru­ary, with some 1,700 vol­un­teer­ing for po­si­tions with ex­ter­nal agen­cies dur­ing the pe­riod. The group also in­cludes another 6,000 em­ploy­ees at its en­gi­neer­ing and tech­ni­cal fa­cil­i­ties.</p>
    <p>The com­pany has man­aged to avoid job cuts so far with gov­ern­ment wage sup­port to the count of some $30 mil­lion a month. Go­ing for­ward to March next year, the quan­tum of this sup­port will be down by a third.</p>
    <p>These job cuts are SIA’s first step to “right­size” in prepa­ra­tion for a tepid state of global air travel, which could last two to four years.</p>
    <p>The In­ter­na­tional Air Trans­port As­so­ci­a­tion – cit­ing poor virus con­tain­ment around the world, de­pressed busi­ness travel and lack of con­sumer con­fi­dence – does not ex­pect air travel to re­turn to pre-Covid-19 lev­els any time be­fore 2024. In the mean­time, it projects that global air­lines will col­lec­tively lose around US$84.3 bil­lion</p>
    <p>(S$115.2 bil­lion) this year and a fur­ther US$15.8 bil­lion next year.</p>
    <p>SIA it­self posted an un­prece­dented loss of $1.1 bil­lion for its April to June 2020 first quar­ter, com­pared with a profit of $111 mil­lion a year ear­lier. It will re­main in the red for the rest of the fis­cal year.</p>
    <p>What these job cuts es­sen­tially do is pre­pare SIA for two more dif­fi­cult years ahead. But job cuts alone will not be enough.</p>
    <p>In July, the air­line car­ried 34,000 pas­sen­gers; in July last year, it car­ried 3.3 mil­lion pas­sen­gers. SIA is op­er­at­ing at about 8 per cent ca­pac­ity now. And ac­cord­ing to man­age­ment fore­casts, it is un­likely to sur­pass 50 per cent even by the end of its cur­rent fis­cal year in March 2021.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, it is burn­ing cash to the tune of al­most $300 mil­lion every month.</p>
    <p>That be­ing the case, SIA will have to ju­di­ciously man­age the $11 bil­lion it cur­rently has in the bank fol­low­ing its $8.8 bil­lion rights is­sue, se­cured loans and new credit lines. Or else most of this cash will dry up in about three years.</p>
    <p>At the mo­ment there is no telling when this pandemic will pass. There is no reliable vac­cine, no plans to open up the global travel mar­kets and no signs that most coun­tries have brought this virus un­der con­trol.</p>
    <p>As an air­line whose planes are over for­eign ter­ri­tory within 14 sec­onds af­ter take-off from its</p>
    <p>Changi home base, SIA needs open bor­ders and open skies. It also needs Sin­ga­pore to open up to all vis­i­tors.</p>
    <p>There is no guar­an­tee that this will hap­pen any time within the next six months.</p>
    <p>So to ride through this cri­sis and emerge as the global player it was, SIA will have to be­come a much smaller com­pany – op­er­at­ing fewer air­craft, with a smaller work­force, serv­ing a smaller net­work and car­ry­ing fewer pas­sen­gers.</p>
    <p>The air­line is send­ing back its A-330 planes and re­tir­ing its B777-200 air­craft. It will likely moth­ball its gi­ant A-380 and B777-300 air­craft too, and use its more fuel-ef­fi­cient and newer A-350s and B-787s.</p>
    <p>Many of its “skinny routes” and sev­eral of its re­gional routes are also likely to be cut.</p>
    <p>But SIA also has to work on a trans­for­ma­tion pro­gramme to eke out max­i­mum ef­fi­cien­cies and cost re­duc­tions. In short, it has to be­come a leaner, meaner and a more tech­no­log­i­cally driven com­pany.</p>
    <p>How­ever, it has to do this with­out los­ing what has es­sen­tially made it a great way to fly.</p>
    <p>Scal­ing down air­craft and as­sets is one thing. But los­ing its best and bright­est peo­ple is quite another, es­pe­cially for a world-beat­ing pre­mium air­line whose pi­lots and cabin crew are ac­knowl­edged by even its com­peti­tors to be the best in the busi­ness.</p>
    <p>SIA must never lose the soul and sub­stance of what makes it the most ad­mired brand in global avi­a­tion.</p>
    <p>The col­lapse in global air travel and the ab­sence of re­cov­ery vis­i­bil­ity are hurt­ing all car­ri­ers. Many will crum­ble. As I’ve said in pre­vi­ous col­umns about SIA and air travel, this is an un­prece­dented event and there is just no play­book for how air­lines should tackle this cri­sis.</p>
    <p>But one thing does not change. When all this is over, peo­ple will grav­i­tate to­wards the brands they trust. And SIA has to be one of them.</p>
    <p>As the Bri­tish singer Rod Ste­wart put it, the first cut is the deep­est. If the re­cov­ery in global air travel takes off as pre­dicted in about two years, this cut may just be the last for SIA.</p>
