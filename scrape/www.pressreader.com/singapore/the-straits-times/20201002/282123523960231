    <p>Vis­i­tors keen to snap pho­tos of chicken-headed women, pig­headed men and deities bat­tling mon­sters at Haw Par Villa will have to wait un­til next year.</p>
    <p>The pop­u­lar theme park is closed from yes­ter­day to March 31 next year for up­grad­ing works, ac­cord­ing to a no­tice on its web­site.</p>
    <p>When con­tacted, the Sin­ga­pore Tourism Board (STB) said it will be con­duct­ing up­grad­ing and con­ser­va­tion works in Haw Par Villa.</p>
    <p>These in­clude en­hanced night light­ing works for the park, ven­ti­la­tion works for the 10 Courts of Hell dio­rama, as well as con­ser­va­tion works for the sculp­tures.</p>
    <p>STB did not re­veal the costs due to busi­ness con­fi­den­tial­ity rea­sons.</p>
    <p>Ms Jean Ng, STB’s ex­ec­u­tive di­rec­tor for at­trac­tions, en­ter­tain­ment and tourism con­cept de­vel­op­ment, said the up­grad­ing works have been planned for.</p>
    <p>“Given the pro­tracted re­cov­ery of mass tourism and the cur­rent safe man­age­ment mea­sures, at­trac­tions are op­er­at­ing be­low their pre</p>
    <p>Covid-19 ca­pac­i­ties,” said Ms Ng.</p>
    <p>“Thus, STB is us­ing this down­time to ex­pe­dite the com­ple­tion of up­grad­ing works. We look for­ward to wel­com­ing vis­i­tors back to the park with improved of­fer­ings.”</p>
    <p>Haw Par Villa said on Face­book, in re­sponse to ne­ti­zens’ com­ments, that the park is “up­grad­ing as we gear up (for) new ex­pe­ri­ences next year”.</p>
    <p>It also told ne­ti­zens that the park “will def­i­nitely be bring­ing more qual­ity con­tent” to vis­i­tors and that “there may be new things com­ing</p>
    <p>your way”.</p>
    <p>Known for its as­sort­ment of some 1,000 sculp­tures de­pict­ing Chi­nese le­gends and folk­lore, the park in Pasir Pan­jang was closed from April 5 to June 30 due to cir­cuit breaker mea­sures.</p>
    <p>On Sept 17, Haw Par Villa put up a no­tice that its 10 Courts Of Hell dio­rama would be closed for main­te­nance works un­til the end of this month.</p>
    <p>Built in 1937, Haw Par Villa was lov­ingly cre­ated by busi­ness ty­coon Aw Boon Haw for his brother Aw Boon Par. It was for­merly named af­ter the Tiger Balm med­i­cal oint­ment cre­ated by their fa­ther.</p>
    <p>The Myan­mar-Chi­nese Aw broth­ers opened the villa to share Chi­nese val­ues and pro­vide a recre­ational area for Asians.</p>
