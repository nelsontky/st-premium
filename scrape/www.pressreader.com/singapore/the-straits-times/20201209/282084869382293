    <p>The au­thor­i­ties have found the body of a 41-year-old man who went miss­ing on Sun­day af­ter­noon while snorkellin­g alone near Sis­ters’ Is­lands Marine Park.</p>
    <p>The po­lice said in an up­date yes­ter­day they found and re­trieved the body at around 5.45pm.</p>
    <p>They had mounted a search and res­cue oper­a­tion on Sun­day for the man, to­gether with the Mar­itime and Port Au­thor­ity of Sin­ga­pore and the Sin­ga­pore Civil De­fence Force. The po­lice re­ceived a call for as­sis­tance at about 12.40pm on Sun­day.</p>
    <p>A park vis­i­tor who was on the is­land that day told The Straits Times that the man’s wife had ap­proached him at about noon to ask if he had seen her hus­band.</p>
    <p>The vis­i­tor, who wanted to be known only as Mr Ariff, said the woman, who looked pan­icked and ap­peared to be in her 30s, de­scribed her hus­band as big-sized and said he had been miss­ing for four hours. The 25-year-old goods ve­hi­cle driver said the woman told him her hus­band had planned to snorkel for 30 min­utes.</p>
    <p>“We were shocked, be­cause he’d been miss­ing for so long and we had just ar­rived in the area,” Mr Ariff told ST.</p>
    <p>With his friends, he went into the wa­ter where the man was last seen snorkellin­g, but said it was very deep and the cur­rents were too strong. While they were swim­ming, they no­ticed po­lice boats cir­cling the area and of­fi­cers walk­ing around the is­land, pre­sum­ably in search of the miss­ing man, said Mr Ariff. He left the is­land at about 4pm with his friends, and added that it was rain­ing heav­ily as he left.</p>
    <p>The po­lice are in­ves­ti­gat­ing the un­nat­u­ral death.</p>
