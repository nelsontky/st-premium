    <p>Since get­ting re­trenched from oil and gas gi­ant ExxonMo­bil two weeks ago, Mr Hameem Mustafa has sent out more than 20 job ap­pli­ca­tions, with no replies yet.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, the 48-year-old’s job hunt con­tin­ued at an en­vi­ron­men­tal ser­vices sec­tor job fair in his neigh­bour­hood in Hong Kah North.</p>
    <p>The for­mer work­place safety and health pro­fes­sional told The Straits Times that re­trench­ment has been dif­fi­cult for him and his wife Halimah Yazeen, 47.</p>
    <p>Her con­tract for work in an ad­min­is­tra­tive role ended last year.</p>
    <p>The cou­ple, who have no chil­dren, care for their el­derly par­ents.</p>
    <p>Mr Hameem said: “I’ll prob­a­bly have to go for half of what I was earn­ing be­cause we can’t de­mand any­thing. At this mo­ment, the im­por­tant thing is to get the job.”</p>
    <p>The two were among sev­eral at­ten­dees at the job fair, which is pro­mot­ing ca­reers in the en­vi­ron­men­tal ser­vices sec­tor for those who may have been im­pacted by the eco­nomic down­turn.</p>
    <p>More than 350 job va­can­cies in about 20 or­gan­i­sa­tions are on of­fer at the event, which is run­ning un­til to­mor­row at the Hong Kah North Com­mu­nity Club.</p>
    <p>The jobs range from waste col­lec­tion truck cap­tain to waste or re­cy­cling fa­cil­ity op­er­a­tions ex­ec­u­tive, with 20 per cent of the va­can­cies for pro­fes­sion­als, man­agers, ex­ec­u­tives and tech­ni­cians (PMETs).</p>
    <p>The fair is or­gan­ised by Hong Kah North Grass­roots Or­gan­i­sa­tions in part­ner­ship with the Waste Man­age­ment and Re­cy­cling As­so­ci­a­tion of Sin­ga­pore (WMRAS).</p>
    <p>Speak­ing at the launch yes­ter­day, Dr Amy Khor, Se­nior Min­is­ter of State for Sus­tain­abil­ity and the En­vi­ron­ment and Trans­port, said: “A lot of peo­ple are now quite con­cerned about the job sit­u­a­tion, es­pe­cially in this Covid-19 sit­u­a­tion, but the en­vi­ron­men­tal ser­vices sec­tor, among some of the other green sec­tors, are ar­eas that have been iden­ti­fied as growth sec­tors.”</p>
    <p>Dr Khor, who is also MP for Hong Kah North, added: “Many of the com­pa­nies which are par­tic­i­pat­ing to­day, and in the next few days, are ac­tu­ally look­ing to em­ploy more peo­ple and ex­pand their op­er­a­tions.”</p>
    <p>The job fair is part of the Hong Kah North Go Green Move­ment, an ini­tia­tive sup­ported by Work­force Sin­ga­pore (WSG), NTUC’s Em­ploy­ment and Em­ploy­a­bil­ity In­sti­tute (e2i) and NTUC Learn­ingHub.</p>
    <p>El­i­gi­ble mid-ca­reer job seek­ers</p>
    <p>can choose to con­vert their skills through the pro­fes­sional con­ver­sion pro­gramme for waste man­age­ment pro­fes­sion­als of­fered by WSG, in part­ner­ship with WMRAS.</p>
    <p>The pro­gramme, sup­ported by the Na­tional En­vi­ron­ment Agency, aims to build a strong work­force in the waste man­age­ment sec­tor by at­tract­ing and re­tain­ing a PMET work­force.</p>
    <p>New mid-ca­reer PMET en­trants</p>
    <p>will be equipped with the rel­e­vant com­pe­ten­cies in lead­er­ship and skills in ar­eas such as qual­ity as­sur­ance and sys­tem de­sign.</p>
    <p>The job fair will also pro­mote train­ing cour­ses by NTUC Learn­ingHub and Repub­lic Polytech­nic.</p>
    <p>In ad­di­tion, NTUC’s e2i will of­fer on-site ca­reer coach­ing to bet­ter pre­pare ap­pli­cants for job in­ter­views.</p>
    <p>The Hong Kah North Go Green</p>
    <p>Move­ment yes­ter­day also launched a re­cy­cling com­pe­ti­tion for house­holds in the con­stituency.</p>
    <p>Res­i­dents can down­load the Step Up Sus­tain­abil­ity app to record their re­cy­cling ef­forts and earn points to re­deem shop­ping vouch­ers. There will also be monthly prizes for the top 10 re­cy­clers from next month to Fe­bru­ary.</p>
