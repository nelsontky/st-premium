    <p>My dog usu­ally has his anal glands ex­pressed dur­ing his reg­u­lar groom­ing ser­vice. His anal glands be­came swollen and rup­tured when pet groom­ing ser­vices were sus­pended dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker. I took him to a vet in­stead. I was told most dogs suf­fer from anal gland im­pactions. Are there ways to pre­vent swelling in anal glands for si­t­u­a­tions where pet own­ers are un­able to con­sult a groomer? Khong Kiong Seng</p>
    <p>Anal sac disease is a com­mon con­di­tion in dogs.</p>
    <p>The anal sac se­cre­tions con­tain chem­i­cals that are used by the an­i­mal to mark ter­ri­tory, and the se­cre­tions are usu­ally squeezed out of the anal sac dur­ing nor­mal bowel move­ment. This pro­vides a unique scent to the fae­ces of in­di­vid­ual an­i­mals.</p>
    <p>Anal sac im­paction oc­curs when the anal sacs fail to empty nor­mally, lead­ing to an ac­cu­mu­la­tion of the se­cre­tion which may lead to ab­scess for­ma­tion, rup­ture and/or in­fec­tion.</p>
    <p>This is likely what hap­pened with your dog. There are a num­ber of un­der­ly­ing fac­tors that may con­trib­ute to anal sac im­paction, in­clud­ing hy­per­secre­tion, in­flam­ma­tion of the anal sac or anal sac can­cers.</p>
    <p>Visit your vet early to rule out any un­der­ly­ing con­di­tions, es­pe­cially if you sus­pect im­pacted anal glands. A rup­tured ab­scess is very painful for the an­i­mal and con­sid­ered a vet­eri­nary emer­gency.</p>
    <p>Man­ag­ing your pet’s weight well and en­sur­ing a com­plete and bal­anced diet with enough fi­bre is im­por­tant. This may im­prove the qual­ity of bowel move­ment to fa­cil­i­tate reg­u­lar emp­ty­ing of the anal sac.</p>
    <p>There is no need for rou­tine man­ual ex­pres­sion of anal glands by own­ers or groomers if a dog’s anal sac can be ex­pressed nat­u­rally.</p>
