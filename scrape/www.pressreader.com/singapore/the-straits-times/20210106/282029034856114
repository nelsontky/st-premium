    <p>The par­lia­men­tary dis­cus­sion on the 200 pa­tients who were wrongly di­ag­nosed with a more se­vere form of breast can­cer is dis­con­cert­ing (Full re­fund for those given un­nec­es­sary treat­ment at KTPH, Jan 5).</p>
    <p>The mone­tary com­pen­sa­tion may fill some gaps, but is not enough to cover the tan­gi­ble and in­tan­gi­ble losses these pa­tients and their fam­i­lies have suf­fered over the years. One can­not fathom what per­sonal, family, ca­reer and so­cial dis­rup­tions these wrong di­ag­noses have caused.</p>
    <p>A mere men­tion of the com­mon side ef­fects of the most com­monly used drug that tar­gets this type of can­cer, such as di­ar­rhoea, chills and fa­tigue, grossly un­der­es­ti­mates the phys­i­cal and men­tal stress these peo­ple have un­der­gone.</p>
    <p>An­other un­com­fort­able “con­so­la­tion” of­fered was that glob­ally, 6 per cent of pa­tients are wrongly di­ag­nosed with this more se­vere form of breast can­cer. To each af­fected pa­tient, this statis­tic is mean­ing­less.</p>
    <p>Two hun­dred wrongly di­ag­nosed pa­tients is not a small num­ber. There are use­ful lessons and in­for­ma­tion for the pub­lic and doc­tors, too, if the ques­tions are ad­dressed more clearly.</p>
    <p>In to­day’s state of med­i­cal ad­vance­ment, and with de­tailed guide­lines for as­sess­ing and man­ag­ing pa­tients, one does not need to wait years for a large num­ber of wrong di­ag­noses to trig­ger an alert that some­thing has gone wrong.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore­ans are proud of the stan­dard of health­care achieved over the years. But we need con­tin­ued as­sur­ance that the high qual­ity is main­tained and kept uni­form across all hos­pi­tals.</p>
    <p>One can­not fathom what per­sonal, family, ca­reer and so­cial dis­rup­tions these wrong di­ag­noses have caused.</p>
