    <p>LON­DON • Mikel Arteta claimed Arse­nal cap­tain Pierre-Em­er­ick Aubameyang is close to sign­ing a new con­tract, af­ter the Gun­ners beat Liver­pool 5-4 on penal­ties fol­low­ing a 1-1 draw in the Com­mu­nity Shield on Saturday.</p>
    <p>Aubameyang put Arteta’s side ahead in the first half at Wem­b­ley with a typ­i­cally eye-catch­ing strike. Ja­pan’s Takumi Mi­namino equalised for Liver­pool late in the sec­ond half of the an­nual pre-sea­son friendly be­tween the Premier League cham­pi­ons and FA Cup win­ners.</p>
    <p>In the shoot-out, Liver­pool’s young striker Rhian Brewster was the only player to miss, hit­ting the bar with their third penalty be­fore Aubameyang calmly dis­patched the de­ci­sive spot-kick.</p>
    <p>As if Arteta needed any re­mind­ing, it was an­other sign of the in­flu­ence wielded by Aubameyang, who is yet to com­mit his long-term fu­ture to the club as he en­ters the fi­nal year of his con­tract.</p>
    <p>The Gabon for­ward has kept Arse­nal wait­ing ner­vously dur­ing pro­tracted talks and he de­murred when asked in a post-match in­ter­view if he was ready to sign the club’s con­tract of­fer.</p>
    <p>“We are go­ing to see, to­day we will just take the tro­phy and that is it,” he said.</p>
    <p>Arteta has re­mained con­fi­dent the 31-year-old will stay and he in­sisted his tal­is­man’s sta­tus will be re­solved to his sat­is­fac­tion be­fore the Premier League sea­son starts on Sept 12.</p>
    <p>“We are close,” Arteta said of the con­tract. “He was mag­nif­i­cent in the FA Cup fi­nal (scor­ing both goals in the 2-1 win over Chelsea ear­lier this month) and again to­day.</p>
    <p>“Big games, big mo­ments, big play­ers. He is re­spond­ing re­ally well to that kind of pres­sure.”</p>
    <p>For Liver­pool, it was the sec­ond suc­ces­sive sea­son they have lost the Com­mu­nity Shield on penal­ties af­ter be­ing beaten by Manch­ester City last term.</p>
    <p>That is un­likely to con­cern coach</p>
    <p>Jurgen Klopp too much, given the cham­pi­ons’ lack of rest and prepa­ra­tion since win­ning the top-flight ti­tle for the first time in 30 years.</p>
    <p>“For these type of games you need the fi­nal punch. We cre­ated enough, had the ball quite a lot, but had to be care­ful of their counter-at­tack,” said Klopp, whose side lacked in­ten­sity and their usual fierce, high-tempo press­ing,</p>
    <p>“A penalty shoot-out is al­ways a lit­tle bit of a lottery and we were un­lucky there, so con­grat­u­la­tions to Arse­nal.”</p>
    <p>Liver­pool and Arse­nal were back in ac­tion just 34 days af­ter the end of the coro­n­avirus-de­layed Premier League cam­paign.</p>
    <p>Af­ter only one week of pre-sea­son train­ing, it was a more en­cour­ag­ing re­sult for Arteta, whose team em­u­lated their FA Cup fi­nal win with an­other de­ter­mined, tac­ti­cally as­tute dis­play.</p>
    <p>De­fend­ing deep and at­tack­ing on the counter, with in­struc­tions to tar­get Liver­pool’s young de­fender Neco Wil­liams play­ing in place of the in­jured Trent Alexan­der­Arnold, the Gun­ners took the lead through Aubameyang’s su­perb curler af­ter he pun­ished the rookie’s cau­tious ap­proach.</p>
    <p>He cel­e­brated the goal by cross­ing his arms in trib­ute to Black Pan­ther ac­tor Chad­wick Bose­man, who died on Friday aged 43.</p>
    <p>It was his fifth goal for Arse­nal at Wem­b­ley, mak­ing him the club’s joint high­est scorer ever at the na­tional sta­dium with Alexis Sanchez, now of In­ter Mi­lan.</p>
    <p>“I knew the chal­lenge we were fac­ing against this in­cred­i­ble op­po­nent. Thank you very much to the play­ers for the ef­fort and the per­for­mance,” Arteta said.</p>
    <p>“I knew we would suf­fer in the sec­ond half. We didn’t have the legs, but in the penal­ties the boys had courage to put things right.”</p>
    <p>Liver­pool equalised in the 73rd minute when Mi­namino slot­ted home from close range for his first Reds goal in his 15th ap­pear­ance since his Jan­uary move from Salzburg.</p>
    <p>AL­MOST THERE</p>
    <p>We are close. He was mag­nif­i­cent in the FA Cup fi­nal (scor­ing both goals in the 2-1 win over Chelsea ear­lier this month) and again to­day. Big games, big mo­ments, big play­ers. He is re­spond­ing re­ally well to that kind of pres­sure.</p>
