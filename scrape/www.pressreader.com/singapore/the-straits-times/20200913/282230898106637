    <p>It has been a while since I – along with many other Sin­ga­pore­ans – last took a ca­ble car ride.</p>
    <p>So when I join the new Gai Gai Tour, a two-hour guided tour around Mount Faber Park that in­cludes a 30-minute round trip on the Mount Faber line, I am pleas­antly sur­prised to find that the rain­bow-hued ca­ble cars from my child­hood have been given a refreshing up­date.</p>
    <p>We ride in sleek, black, fourth­gen­er­a­tion cab­ins, with UV-tinted panes and an air cir­cu­la­tion sys­tem to keep us cool. A new com­men­tary sys­tem, cur­rently un­der pi­lot, points out at­trac­tions such as Mount Faber Park as we glide over them.</p>
    <p>This is Sin­ga­pore, where things are con­stantly be­ing re­freshed, mod­ernised, up­graded – es­sen­tial to at­tract the lo­cal crowd. And there is no bet­ter time than the present to ex­plore at home, with over­seas travel halted due to the Covid-19 pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Since ca­ble cars be­gan ply­ing the skies in July af­ter the cir­cuit breaker, One Faber Group, which runs ser­vices, at­trac­tions and food and bev­er­age out­lets in and around Sen­tosa, has launched at­trac­tive deals to woo travel-starved lo­cals hun­gry for a dif­fer­ent view.</p>
    <p>Th­ese in­clude a round-trip on the Sen­tosa Line at one-fifth the usual price, just $3 an adult and $2 a child.</p>
    <p>The Gai Gai Tour, at $20 an adult and $15 a child, is also good value – it is more than $10 cheaper than the cost of the full-priced ca­ble car ride alone.</p>
    <p>The tour be­gins at Faber Peak, where tour guide Omar Shar­iff, 51, says the lush hill­top lo­ca­tion makes him feel like he is over­seas.</p>
    <p>At first I think he is ex­ag­ger­at­ing – ev­ery other tour th­ese days seems to promise the same. But when dap­pled sun­light streams through conif­er­ous trees, glint­ing off a canopy back­dropped by the city sky­line, I am in­deed trans­ported.</p>
    <p>Shop­houses and hous­ing board flats lend colour; slate-grey build­ings of the Cen­tral Business Dis­trict tower im­pres­sively.</p>
    <p>A stroll past the mu­ral wall is a re­minder of how we got here. Six­teen cop­per-tooled mu­rals de­pict Sin­ga­pore’s jour­ney from fish­ing vil­lage to gar­den city. It is a his­tory les­son in a nut­shell, wind­ing up at a rain tree al­most half a cen­tury old.</p>
    <p>For­mer deputy prime min­is­ter Goh Keng Swee planted it on Sin­ga­pore’s first tree-plant­ing day i n 1971, three years be­fore he launched Sin­ga­pore Ca­ble Car in 1974 – one of the coun­try’s first tourist at­trac­tions and a feather in the cap of a young na­tion.</p>
    <p>It is nuggets of in­for­ma­tion like th­ese that One Faber Group hopes guests will re­mem­ber.</p>
    <p>“The lo­ca­tion of Faber Peak lends it­self well to telling the story of Sin­ga­pore’s his­tory through the eyes of a lo­cal,” says Mr Pa­trick Lee, di­rec­tor of sales and business de­vel­op­ment at One Faber Group.</p>
    <p>Know­ing where we have come from makes the present all the more im­pres­sive.</p>
    <p>From the air, Sen­tosa is awash with colour – loop­ing roller coast­ers at</p>
    <p>Uni­ver­sal Stu­dios, stay­ca­tion­ers loung­ing by the pool, dol­phins frol­ick­ing at Re­sorts World Sen­tosa. Ca­ble cars, laden with fam­i­lies, zip past. The tourism industry, pick­ing it­self up from a bat­ter­ing, is slowly find­ing its foot­ing once more.</p>
    <p>There is some way to go. Wa­ter slides and plunge pools at Ad­ven­ture Cove Water­park re­main dry. Sin­ga­pore Cruise Cen­tre is bereft of the tow­er­ing cruis­ers that used to dock reg­u­larly. On week­ends, says Mr Omar, the wa­ters used to be streaked in the wake of Batam­bound fer­ries.</p>
    <p>But he is hope­ful, as am I. One day, th­ese wa­ters will bus­tle again. And there will be no bet­ter van­tage point than from a ca­ble car.</p>
