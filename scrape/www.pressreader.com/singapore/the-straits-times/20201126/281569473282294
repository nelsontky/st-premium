    <p>•</p>
    <p>HONG KONG Hong Kong Chief Ex­ec­u­tive Car­rie Lam vowed to con­tinue strength­en­ing ties with China, us­ing an an­nual pol­icy ad­dress to de­fend Bei­jing’s tight­en­ing grip over the fi­nan­cial hub and an­nounce new steps to boost eco­nomic links with the main­land.</p>
    <p>In a speech yes­ter­day, Mrs Lam said her ad­min­is­tra­tion’s aim was to re­store con­fi­dence fol­low­ing an­other tu­mul­tuous year. She spoke against the back­drop of a new wave of Covid-19 cases, an econ­omy in deep con­trac­tion, po­lit­i­cal tur­moil and wors­en­ing wealth in­equal­ity.</p>
    <p>“The pri­mary ob­jec­tive of this pol­icy ad­dress is to look at ways to get Hong Kong out of the im­passe and to re­store peo­ple’s con­fi­dence as soon as pos­si­ble,” she said in the speech, which was de­layed by more than a month to ac­com­mo­date her trip to Bei­jing for talks on how China can help with the finance hub’s eco­nomic re­cov­ery.</p>
    <p>Mrs Lam said Hong Kong’s econ­omy can ben­e­fit “from its prox­im­ity to the main­land and the cen­tral gov­ern­ment’s long­stand­ing sup­port un­der the ‘one coun­try, two sys­tems’ prin­ci­ple”.</p>
    <p>She spent a size­able part of her speech pro­mot­ing the Greater Bay Area project that en­vi­sions Hong Kong’s eco­nomic and po­lit­i­cal fu­ture be­ing more closely en­twined with the nearby main­land ci­ties of Guangzhou and Shen­zhen.</p>
    <p>She spoke about var­i­ous pro­grammes to boost em­ploy­ment op­por­tu­ni­ties for young Hong Kongers to take jobs in the main­land, in­clud­ing a wage sub­sidy for peo­ple work­ing in tech­nol­ogy firms. But crit­ics in Hong Kong see the project as an at­tempt to fur­ther erode the city’s au­ton­omy fol­low­ing Bei­jing’s moves to crack down on po­lit­i­cal speech and assem­bly.</p>
    <p>Many Hong Kong youth – in­clud­ing those who took part in protests that drew mil­lions on the streets – have said they would not ac­cept the much lower wages there, nor risk trav­el­ling there and be­ing de­tained at the border.</p>
    <p>Mrs Lam also spoke of the need to re­store or­der and pro­tect China’s na­tional se­cu­rity. “In the past year or so, Hong Kong has ex­pe­ri­enced the most se­vere po­lit­i­cal chal­lenges since its re­turn to the moth­er­land,” Mrs Lam said. “One of our ur­gent pri­or­i­ties is to re­store... con­sti­tu­tional or­der and po­lit­i­cal sys­tem from chaos.”</p>
    <p>She ac­cused for­eign gov­ern­ments of in­creas­ing in­ter­fer­ence in Hong Kong’s af­fairs, which she said were China’s in­ter­nal af­fairs, and that their ac­tions were jeop­ar­dis­ing na­tional se­cu­rity.</p>
    <p>Mrs Lam said the gov­ern­ment will in­tro­duce a Bill to “en­hance oath-tak­ing” by civil ser­vants and con­duct wide­spread public ed­u­ca­tion “to en­hance the un­der­stand­ing of the rule of law”. The gov­ern­ment will launch pro­grammes to ed­u­cate Hong Kong’s youth, who were at the front lines of last year’s protests, about re­spect­ing China’s na­tional flag and its an­them.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, a plan to build ar­ti­fi­cial is­lands, es­ti­mated to cost at least HK$624 bil­lion (S$108 bil­lion), is ex­pected to move fur­ther along in the com­ing year. The plan en­vi­sions build­ing up to 400,000 homes across 1,700ha of re­claimed land be­tween Lan­tau is­land and the main Hong Kong is­land.</p>
    <p>Mrs Lam did not an­nounce any sig­nif­i­cant new spend­ing mea­sures in her speech.</p>
    <p>The gov­ern­ment has al­ready pro­vided more than HK$310 bil­lion in virus stim­u­lus this year, with Mrs Lam pre­vi­ously say­ing that the tight fis­cal sit­u­a­tion means there is lim­ited room for more ex­pen­di­ture.</p>
    <p>A resur­gence in Covid-19 cases is also prov­ing to be a more im­me­di­ate set­back for the econ­omy, which is set to con­tract 6.1 per cent this year.</p>
    <p>The out­break has al­ready de­layed a Hong Kong-Sin­ga­pore travel bubble meant to re­vive tourism in the two fi­nan­cial hubs.</p>
