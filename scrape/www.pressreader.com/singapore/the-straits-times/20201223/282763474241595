    <p>NEW YORK • It was with some fan­fare that Satur­day Night Live (SNL) an­nounced in Septem­ber that it had re­cruited ac­tor Jim Car­rey to play f ormer United States vice-pres­i­dent Joe Biden, then the Demo­cratic pres­i­den­tial nom­i­nee and now Pres­i­dent-elect.</p>
    <p>At the time, SNL cre­ator and ex­ec­u­tive pro­ducer Lorne Michaels went so far as to say Car­rey’s per­for­mance would be “stun­ning, and pos­si­bly tran­scend com­edy”.</p>
    <p>But Car­rey’s exit from the role, which he had not played since last month, was more sub­dued.</p>
    <p>In a tweet posted last Satur­day af­ter­noon, Car­rey wrote that his time play­ing Mr Biden “was only meant to be six weeks” and that although he con­sid­ered the as­sign­ment to be “com­edy’s high­est call of duty”, he was “just one in a long line of proud, fight­ing SNL Bi­dens”.</p>
    <p>By last Satur­day night, SNL had al­ready lined up an­other cast mem­ber, Alex Mof­fat, to play Mr Biden in the show’s open­ing sketch.</p>
    <p>The sketch fo­cused on US VicePres­i­dent Mike Pence (played by Beck Ben­nett) re­ceiv­ing a coro­n­avirus vac­cine from a doc­tor played by Mikey Day.</p>
    <p>They were then joined by ac­tress Maya Ru­dolph in her re­cur­ring role as US Vice-Pres­i­dent-elect Ka­mala Har­ris.</p>
    <p>Mof­fat made his en­trance as Mr Biden, walk­ing with a cane and wear­ing an or­thopaedic boot on one foot – only to turn a Willy Wonka-style som­er­sault and stand up­right.</p>
    <p>“You look dif­fer­ent some­how,” Ben­nett said, al­lud­ing to the new cast­ing.</p>
    <p>Mof­fat replied: “I’m like Colonel San­ders – ev­ery time you see me, I’m a dif­fer­ent guy. There’s a good chance that this time next year, I’m go­ing to be Mario Lopez.”</p>
    <p>This episode, fea­tur­ing singer Dua Lipa as its mu­si­cal guest, was the fi­nal live broad­cast of the year.</p>
