    <p>Sal­va­tion could now j ust be a Zoom call away with the tra­di­tional Hindu rit­ual for the dead – the pind daan – in­creas­ingly mov­ing on­line be­cause of the coro­n­avirus pan­demic.</p>
    <p>A pind daan is an im­por­tant rit­ual for Hindu fam­i­lies that has staved off change for mil­len­nia. It is con­ducted a year af­ter a per­son’s death so that the soul at­tains sal­va­tion.</p>
    <p>Such cer­e­monies are held by the dead per­son’s de­scen­dants at sa­cred lo­ca­tions in places such as Varanasi (Ut­tar Pradesh), Gaya (Bi­har) and Sid­dh­pur (Gu­jarat).</p>
    <p>One of the first firms to of­fer on­line pind daans – Holy Voy­ages, a Varanasi-based travel agency – did so in 2015. It has seen such ser­vices more than dou­ble to 185 so far this year from 74 last year.</p>
    <p>While its cus­tomers in­clude In­di­ans liv­ing abroad, the ma­jor­ity are from within In­dia.</p>
    <p>“The num­ber has cer­tainly in­creased be­cause of the pan­demic that has lim­ited the abil­ity of peo­ple to travel to holy places where these rit­u­als are con­ducted,” said Mr Prashant Verma, the di­rec­tor of Holy Voy­ages.</p>
    <p>While con­ducted through­out the year, a par­tic­u­lar aus­pi­cious pe­riod to pro­pi­ti­ate an­ces­tors is Pitru Pak­sha, a 16-day pe­riod in the Hindu cal­en­dar that, this year, fell in the first half of last month.</p>
    <p>It co­in­cided with the Hun­gry Ghost Fes­ti­val which is marked in Sin­ga­pore and other parts of South-east Asia to ap­pease the dead.</p>
    <p>An on­line pind daan ser­vice in­cor­po­rates the reg­u­lar rit­u­als but re­places the de­scen­dant of the dead per­son, who nor­mally par­tic­i­pates in a con­ven­tional ser­vice, with a lo­cal rep­re­sen­ta­tive. The cer­e­mony is then ei­ther streamed live or recorded for it to be sent later to the fam­ily of the dead per­son.</p>
    <p>Mr Shashank Mishra, the di­rec­tor of an­other Varanasi-based firm that of­fers re­li­gious ser­vices, said on­line pind daans surged “100 per cent” be­tween March and Septem­ber this year, com­pared to the same pe­riod last year.</p>
    <p>The po­ten­tial for such a prac­tice to flour­ish in a post-pan­demic world has con­vinced oth­ers to cash in on the trend.</p>
    <p>Trav­elBaits, an agency based in Ben­galuru, launched an on­line pind daan ser­vice in Au­gust, a year af­ter it be­gan of­fer­ing reg­u­lar pind daans as part of its off­line tour pack­ages in holy places. It has con­ducted five such cer­e­monies so far.</p>
    <p>“There has a been a ma­jor dis­rup­tion be­cause of the pan­demic,” Ms Shradha Sinha, chief ex­ec­u­tive and co-founder of Trav­elBaits, told The Straits Times.</p>
    <p>“Prior to this, peo­ple never thought of on­line re­li­gious cer­e­monies as an op­tion. While many will con­tinue to opt for an ac­tual ser­vice af­ter the pan­demic, there will be those un­able to travel, in­clud­ing those liv­ing abroad, who will now in­creas­ingly choose on­line cer­e­monies,” she added.</p>
    <p>But the on­line adop­tion of pind daan has drawn vo­cif­er­ous op­po­si­tion from lo­cal in­flu­en­tial priests across the coun­try, in­clud­ing the Sri Vish­nu­pad Man­age­ment Com­mit­tee in Gaya that rep­re­sents lo­cal priests.</p>
    <p>“It is com­pletely against our val­ues and those who are opt­ing for such ser­vices, as well as priests car­ry­ing them out, are both do­ing the wrong thing,” said Mr Hi­ranath Darhi­wala, a senior pri­est based in Gaya.</p>
    <p>Even priests who con­duct pind daans on­line have their reser­va­tions. Mr Amar­nath, who uses only one name, rec­om­mends an on­line ser­vice only for those who are phys­i­cally in­ca­pac­i­tated or are ex­tremely busy. The pri­est based in Gaya has con­ducted only around five such cer­e­monies in the last five years.</p>
    <p>“It doesn’t have the same value as a cer­e­mony that is ac­tu­ally per­formed by some­one from the fam­ily at the holy place of pil­grim­age,” he added. “Isn’t there a dif­fer­ence be­tween pay­ing re­spects to one’s par­ents by ac­tu­ally touch­ing their feet and do­ing so over the phone?”</p>
    <p>Mr V. V. Subra­ma­nian, a man­age­ment pro­fes­sional based in Kuwait, and his fam­ily are among those who opted for an on­line pind daan at Varanasi this year on Sept 13 for his late mother-in-law.</p>
    <p>He told The Straits Times that the fam­ily would have cho­sen an on­line ser­vice even if they had been based in their home­town in Hy­der­abad in In­dia.</p>
    <p>“When the rites are per­formed at home, it is al­ways through a learned pri­est. We’re not aware of the prac­tices or chants.</p>
    <p>“Hence, what is the dif­fer­ence if this pri­est is miles away and not next to you? It is the thought and be­lief that mat­ter,” Mr Subra­ma­nian said.</p>
    <p>“If there’s even a re­mote pos­si­bil­ity that what we’re do­ing can help the de­parted soul, then what’s the harm in do­ing it? Isn’t it bet­ter than not per­form­ing it?”</p>
