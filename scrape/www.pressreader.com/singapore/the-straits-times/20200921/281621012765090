    <p>More equal shar­ing of care­giv­ing re­spon­si­bil­i­ties, bet­ter ed­u­ca­tion on is­sues of sex and con­sent, and weed­ing out ban­ter that ob­jec­ti­fies women – th­ese are some of the is­sues af­fect­ing women which ad­vo­cates want to see con­sid­ered in a com­pre­hen­sive re­view that was an­nounced at a di­a­logue yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Leg­is­lat­ing some of th­ese sug­ges­tions will send a strong sig­nal on women’s role in Sin­ga­pore so­ci­ety, but such ef­forts must be cou­pled with ed­u­ca­tion to drive a change in mind­set, they said.</p>
    <p>Ex­ec­u­tive di­rec­tor of the As­so­ci­a­tion of Women for Ac­tion and Re­search (Aware) Corinna Lim lauded the re­view, adding that it was cru­cial for it to ad­dress the most press­ing is­sues fac­ing women cur­rently.</p>
    <p>Th­ese in­clude: the so­ci­etal ex­pec­ta­tion that women should be the pri­mary care­givers at home, the wide­spread ac­cep­tance of the sex­ual ob­jec­ti­fi­ca­tion of women, and the low pri­or­ity placed by work­places on is­sues of dis­crim­i­na­tion and bias.</p>
    <p>“What is most ex­cit­ing to Aware is the stated ap­proach to re­view the un­der­ly­ing val­ues and cul­tural mind­set to­wards women and gen­der equal­ity, in­stead of look­ing only at is­sues in the short term. In this re­gard, we hope that the Gov­ern­ment will con­sider ex­plic­itly en­shrin­ing gen­der equal­ity in the Sin­ga­pore Con­sti­tu­tion,” added Ms Lim.</p>
    <p>An MP for Nee Soon GRC Louis Ng, who has been a strong ad­vo­cate in Par­lia­ment for gen­der equal­ity at the work­place and in the home, said the re­view is a “break­through” but hoped there would be leg­is­la­tion to sup­port the re­sult­ing poli­cies.</p>
    <p>“Per­haps it is time to leg­is­late some of the (ex­ist­ing) guide­lines to show some im­por­tance to the is­sues, and this then goes to chang­ing mind­sets,” he said, cit­ing guide­lines by the Tri­par­tite Al­liance for Fair and Pro­gres­sive Em­ploy­ment Prac­tices (Tafep) that for­bid em­ploy­ers from ask­ing in­ter­vie­wees and em­ploy­ees about their mar­i­tal sta­tus and plans to have chil­dren.</p>
    <p>“Th­ese are tri­par­tite guide­lines, but ei­ther peo­ple are not fol­low­ing them or they are not aware of them,” said Mr Ng. “Leg­is­la­tion forms the foun­da­tion, and we need to get the leg­is­la­tion right, and then af­ter that, the mind­set will shift.”</p>
    <p>AT THE WORK­PLACE</p>
    <p>Ms K. Thanaletch­imi, chair­man of the NTUC Women’s Com­mit­tee, said ar­eas for im­prove­ment in­clude</p>
    <p>in­sti­tu­tion­al­is­ing flex­i­ble work ar­range­ments and hav­ing paid care­giv­ing leave, es­pe­cially as women shoul­der much of this work.</p>
    <p>“While it is heart­en­ing that flex­i­ble work ar­range­ments are much more wide­spread now (with Covid-19), we hope the Gov­ern­ment would also look to leg­is­lat­ing this if there is a fear that em­ploy­ers would re­vert to pre­vi­ous prac­tices af­ter this pe­riod,” she said.</p>
    <p>Ms Lim of Aware said that while fe­male rep­re­sen­ta­tion in board po­si­tions is a use­ful in­dex, the White Pa­per the re­view will cul­mi­nate in should ide­ally take an “in­ter­sec­tional” ap­proach, and avoid be­ing an ex­am­i­na­tion of is­sues that af­fect only priv­i­leged women. “Be­yond the White Pa­per, we hope that the Gov­ern­ment pays greater at­ten­tion to rep­re­sen­ta­tion and in­clu­sion in all ar­eas, such as its se­nior man­age­ment and task forces,” she said.</p>
    <p>Ms At­tiya Ashraf Ali, 25, vice-pres­i­dent of Men­daki Club who par­tic­i­pated in the di­a­logue yes­ter­day, said that among the top­ics dis­cussed were ca­reer pro­gres­sion and op­por­tu­ni­ties, and ex­ter­nal fac­tors that could un­der­mine them.</p>
    <p>Th­ese fac­tors in­clude care­giv­ing re­spon­si­bil­i­ties that tra­di­tion­ally fall to women. She added: “(This could) af­fect their abil­ity to con­trib­ute mean­ing­fully to the work­place, which could have im­pli­ca­tions on how they are able to get pro­moted.”</p>
    <p>SO­CI­ETAL AT­TI­TUDES</p>
    <p>Ul­ti­mately, to make sub­stan­tive progress in gen­der equal­ity, the whole of so­ci­ety needs to change how it per­ceives women and get rid of neg­a­tive stereo­types, said Ms Thanaletch­imi, who is pres­i­dent of the Health­care Ser­vices Em­ploy­ees Union and a for­mer Nom­i­nated MP.</p>
    <p>“There is stereo­typ­ing go­ing on in the minds of many peo­ple, in­clud­ing women, and they per­ceive that men and women should be do­ing cer­tain work or dressed a cer­tain way. I think it takes the whole of so­ci­ety to rec­tify this – a mind­set change,” she said.</p>
    <p>Com­mu­ni­ca­tions pro­fes­sional Candy Choo, 24, who has spo­ken up for women’s rights and gen­der is­sues on her so­cial me­dia plat­forms, said she would like to see more men also ad­vo­cate equal­ity. One way of do­ing this is to call out prob­lem­atic be­haviour from other men, such as mak­ing deroga­tory com­ments, sex­ist jokes or mak­ing sex­ual ad­vances on col­leagues, she said.</p>
    <p>An­other change she would like to see is not hav­ing a per­son’s level of ed­u­ca­tion play a mit­i­gat­ing fac­tor when be­ing pros­e­cuted for sex­ual crimes in court. “Of­fend­ers from good ed­u­ca­tion back­grounds should be ex­pected to know right from wrong,” she said.</p>
    <p>Mr Bryan Chiew, 23, pres­i­dent of the Nanyang Tech­no­log­i­cal Uni­ver­sity Stu­dents’ Union, said: “For in­stance, ‘locker room talk’ that per­pet­u­ates ob­jec­ti­fi­ca­tion of women is some­thing we must stamp out and not just be a by­stander, al­though this might be very dif­fi­cult to do, es­pe­cially when one is among peers.”</p>
    <p>Mr Khairul Hilmi Mohd Khair, 32, who works at an en­gi­neer­ing con­sult­ing firm and was a co-fa­cil­i­ta­tor at the di­a­logue, said: “We know where we as­pire to be in terms of the gen­der equal­ity map, and a lot of poli­cies are slowly chang­ing. But ac­com­pa­ny­ing those poli­cies is the crit­i­cal need for a mind­set shift.”</p>
    <p>The ad­vi­sory com­mit­tee mem­ber at Youth Corps Sin­ga­pore said this shift was pos­si­ble in the “small things” at home and in so­cial gath­er­ings, like hav­ing the moral courage to speak out when peo­ple, es­pe­cially men, have in­ap­pro­pri­ate con­ver­sa­tions about the op­po­site sex.</p>
    <p>“If we keep silent, we are re­in­forc­ing th­ese wrong val­ues,” he said.</p>
