    <p>A man and his former wife were so un­happy with their divorce pro­ceed­ings, they sep­a­rately di­rected their anger at the court – and both ended up be­ing given jail sen­tences.</p>
    <p>The man, Lim Teck Leng, was yes­ter­day sen­tenced to six weeks’ jail af­ter be­ing found guilty of one count of ha­rass­ment.</p>
    <p>The 42-year-old Sin­ga­porean had fired an e-mail to the Fam­ily Jus­tice Courts (FJC) judge in 2018 pro­claim­ing her a “beast” and “un­fit as a hu­man be­ing”. The e-mail was also sent to sev­eral politi­cians and pub­lic ap­point­ment hold­ers.</p>
    <p>His former wife – Chi­nese na­tional Zhang Honghong, 37 – was sen­tenced to three weeks’ jail in De­cem­ber last year af­ter plead­ing guilty to a ha­rass­ment charge. In an elec­tron­i­cally filed sum­mons ap­pli­ca­tion, she at­tached an af­fi­davit stat­ing that she would “smash” the court and hit the FJC judge.</p>
    <p>The cou­ple were mar­ried on Sept 7, 2010, and went on to have two chil­dren.</p>
    <p>But on July 18, 2015, Zhang filed a writ of divorce. The mat­ter was later heard by the vic­tim af­ter she took over from the pre­vi­ous judge in 2017.</p>
    <p>On Aug 25 that year, the judge made an or­der for Zhang to have care and con­trol of the chil­dren. In ad­di­tion, Lim had to pay Zhang $175,000 in the di­vi­sion of their mat­ri­mo­nial as­sets, and $300 a month in spousal main­te­nance for a year. He also had to fork out $1,800 a year for child main­te­nance.</p>
    <p>Zhang com­mit­ted her of­fence in De­cem­ber 2017 when she was upset with Lim for not pay­ing main­te­nance and with the FJC, which she felt did not help her enough.</p>
    <p>On May 15, 2018, the judge heard ar­gu­ments on two ap­pli­ca­tions by Zhang per­tain­ing to mat­ters in­volv­ing the ear­lier or­ders.</p>
    <p>“In the course of this hear­ing, (Lim) crit­i­cised the vic­tim (as) hav­ing taken just one day to make her de­ci­sion,” Deputy Pub­lic Pros­e­cu­tor David Koh said in his sub­mis­sions.</p>
    <p>Lim then sent the e-mail in­sult­ing the judge on June 1 that year.</p>
