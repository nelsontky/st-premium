    <p>Job hunt­ing is al­ways daunt­ing, but it is even more so now for older, mid-ca­reer work­ers such as Ms Lau Disan, who re­cently moved from the re­tail sec­tor to early child­hood ed­u­ca­tion.</p>
    <p>One of the big­gest ob­sta­cles she faced was that her last-drawn salary was higher than what com­pa­nies could of­fer, she said, and she sees how gov­ern­ment in­cen­tives can help oth­ers in the same boat.</p>
    <p>Ms Lau, 46, was a re­tail man­ager for 15 years in the jew­ellery line. She left her job in March for an­other job of­fer in sales. She was sup­posed to start in April, but this fell through when the pan­demic hit.</p>
    <p>“The big­gest chal­lenge even be­fore I re­signed was the salary part, be­cause if I re­ally wanted to switch ca­reers, I had to take a huge step back in terms of salary,” she said.</p>
    <p>“I had to start fresh all over. I had to man­age my ego and ac­cept more than a 50 per cent pay cut.”</p>
    <p>She added that she sent out many job ap­pli­ca­tions even be­fore the pan­demic, but was re­jected.</p>
    <p>“Look­ing at my re­tail ex­pe­ri­ence, it is very hard to map even the soft skills I have onto an­other sec­tor. Peo­ple still look at what you did be­fore,” she noted.</p>
    <p>This month, Ms Lau got into a Place and Train pro­gramme, which pro­vides train­ing and salary sup­port to help work­ers reskill for new jobs in dif­fer­ent sec­tors.</p>
    <p>She is now a trainee child­care ed­u­ca­tor at Kin­der­land.</p>
    <p>“The pay is very rea­son­able but still lower than my pre­vi­ous one. The pre­cious part is they are will­ing to let me try and learn,” she said.</p>
    <p>“In­cen­tives will en­cour­age em­ploy­ers to hire peo­ple like me. Most of the mid-ca­reer work­ers I have met are very will­ing to learn, and their many years of ex­pe­ri­ence in the work­force will be a plus point for the em­ployer.”</p>
