    <p>A share­holder group can own sub­stan­tial stakes in two real es­tate in­vest­ment trust (Reit) man­agers that man­age trusts in­vested in the same prop­erty class, the Mon­e­tary Au­thor­ity of Sin­ga­pore ( MAS) noted yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Its clar­i­fi­ca­tion came in re­sponse to queries about the pro­posed merger of Sa­bana Shari’ah Com­pli­ant In­dus­trial Real Es­tate In­vest­ment Trust (Sa­bana Reit) and ESRReit, whose man­agers share the same spon­sor, ESR Cay­man.</p>
    <p>Mi­nor­ity unit hold­ers claim there might be po­ten­tial “se­vere” con­flicts of in­ter­est aris­ing from ESR Cay­man’s con­trol­ling own­er­ship of both man­agers, among other con­cerns about the merger. The unit hold­ers “ur­gently” sought guid­ance from MAS and Sin­ga­pore Ex­change Reg­u­la­tion last week on how to re­solve the al­leged con­flict.</p>
    <p>MAS noted yes­ter­day that there are safe­guards un­der the Se­cu­ri­ties and Fu­tures Act to mit­i­gate po­ten­tial con­flicts of in­ter­est.</p>
    <p>For in­stance, in­de­pen­dent di­rec­tors must com­prise at least half of the boards of Reit man­agers where unit hold­ers do not have the right to ap­point di­rec­tors.</p>
    <p>The Sa­bana man­ager’s board is com­posed en­tirely of in­de­pen­dent di­rec­tors, with none from ei­ther ESR Cay­man or the ESR-Reit man­ager, the man­ager said in a bourse fil­ing yes­ter­day. There is also no over­lap of man­age­ment teams be­tween the Sa­bana man­ager and the ESR-Reit man­ager.</p>
    <p>MAS noted that Reit man­agers and their di­rec­tors must act in the best in­ter­ests of unit hold­ers and pri­ori­tise their in­ter­ests over those of the man­ager and its in­vestors.</p>
    <p>The Sa­bana man­ager’s fil­ing said its board is propos­ing the merger by way of a trust scheme of ar­range­ment “in ac­cor­dance with its fidu­ciary du­ties”. A trust scheme of ar­range­ment is a “fair and eq­ui­table” way of ef­fect­ing the merger, as it will pro­vide a bi­nary out­come – “all or noth­ing” – for the pro­posal, it added.</p>
    <p>MAS can re­quire fi­nan­cial in­sti­tu­tions to put in place ad­di­tional mea­sures to ad­dress spe­cific risks, in­clud­ing con­flicts of in­ter­est.</p>
    <p>“We have done so in the case of ESR-Reit and Sa­bana Reit,” it said.</p>
    <p>MAS also noted that only the Sa­bana unit hold­ers who are in­de­pen­dent have a say in whether to ap­prove or re­ject the pro­posed merger based on the fi­nan­cial terms put forth by the Reit man­agers.</p>
    <p>The scheme re­quires ap­proval by a ma­jor­ity in num­ber of in­de­pen­dent unit hold­ers rep­re­sent­ing at least 75 per cent in value of the units held by those present and vot­ing.</p>
    <p>ESR-Reit’s man­ager, its con­cert par­ties and the com­mon sub­stan­tial unit hold­ers of both Reits – in­clud­ing ESR Cay­man, which holds 20.88 per cent of Sa­bana; Chi­nese bil­lion­aire Tong Jin­quan, who holds 3.3 per cent; Wealthy Foun­tain Hold­ings and e-Shang In­fin­ity Cay­man – will ab­stain from vot­ing.</p>
    <p>The Sa­bana man­ager must also ab­stain from vot­ing on the scheme, which will re­quire court sanc­tion be­fore it can be­come ef­fec­tive.</p>
    <p>This serves as “ad­di­tional pro­tec­tion” for in­de­pen­dent Sa­bana unit hold­ers, the man­ager said.</p>
    <p>It added that its board went through a “thor­ough” process to eval­u­ate the merger, in­volv­ing its man­age­ment team as well as fi­nan­cial ad­vis­ers en­gaged to eval­u­ate the com­mer­cial terms.</p>
    <p>The board of the Sa­bana man­ager also noted that the pro­posed merger was the only for­mal of­fer it re­ceived.</p>
    <p>Sa­bana units closed un­changed at at 37.5 cents yes­ter­day. ESR-Reit was un­changed at 38.5 cents.</p>
