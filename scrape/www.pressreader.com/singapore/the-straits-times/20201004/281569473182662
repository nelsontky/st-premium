    <p>As soon as the Gov­ern­ment an­nounced that ca­pac­ity lim­its at wed­dings would be dou­bled to 100 from yes­ter­day, bride-to-be Sh­eryl See whipped out her al­ter­na­tive guest list and started mak­ing tele­phone calls.</p>
    <p>The 31-year-old said she was well­prepped for any sud­den changes in plans, given the un­cer­tain­ties of the Covid-19 pan­demic. She had even cre­ated four guest lists – for up to 20, 50, 80 and 100 peo­ple – to ac­com­mo­date dif­fer­ent sce­nar­ios for her wed­ding on Oct 18.</p>
    <p>“We had al­ways hoped that gov­ern­ment reg­u­la­tions would change in time for us to in­vite more peo­ple, and it re­ally worked out. We knew ex­actly whom we wanted at our spe­cial day, so it was just a mat­ter of in­form­ing them as soon as it was pos­si­ble to in­clude all of them,” said the bride-to-be, whose guest list will now have al­most 100 names.</p>
    <p>Ms See, who helps to run her fam­ily’s home ap­pli­ances and fur­ni­ture re­tail store, will be ty­ing the knot with bank em­ployee Eddy Ng, 30, at a ho­tel in Or­chard Road.</p>
    <p>They are among the many cou­ples in Sin­ga­pore who have asked venue op­er­a­tors to make last­minute changes to floor plans and guest lists for their wed­dings this month, now that it is pos­si­ble to have up to 100 peo­ple at cer­e­monies and re­cep­tions.</p>
    <p>Venue op­er­a­tors have also re­ceived more in­quiries on bookings.</p>
    <p>The new limit, which in­cludes the wed­ding cou­ple but ex­cludes ven­dors and ser­vice providers, is up from the pre­vi­ous cap of 50.</p>
    <p>But at­ten­dees must be split into ei­ther mul­ti­ple zones of up to 50 per­sons each, or sep­a­rated by stag­gered tim­ings, with up to 50 peo­ple in each time slot. At least 30 min­utes should be al­lo­cated be­tween the time slots for clean­ing and dis­in­fec­tion of the event space.</p>
    <p>Health Min­is­ter Gan Kim Yong an­nounced the changes at a vir­tual press con­fer­ence last month, not­ing that some cou­ples have put off their wed­ding plans in the hope of rid­ing out the pan­demic and later</p>
    <p>pro­ceed­ing with their orig­i­nal plans for a large wed­ding re­cep­tion.</p>
    <p>“But the end of the pan­demic is still some way off and in­def­i­nitely post­pon­ing a wed­ding may not be prac­ti­cal or de­sir­able,” he said.</p>
    <p>The Min­istry of Health said the re­lax­ation of rules is aimed at fa­cil­i­tat­ing mar­riages that may have been post­poned or put on hold.</p>
    <p>But the cap for solem­ni­sa­tions held in homes and the Reg­istries of Civil and Mus­lim Mar­riages build­ing re­mains un­changed at 10 peo­ple, ex­clud­ing the solem­niser.</p>
    <p>Pop­u­lar wed­ding-venue op­er­a­tors, in­clud­ing Good­wood Park Ho­tel, Ho­tel Fort Can­ning, Grand Hy­att, and the Mil­len­nium Ho­tels and Re­sorts group told The Sun­day Times that they re­ceived re­quests from cou­ples about mak­ing changes to their plans al­most im­me­di­ately after Mr Gan’s an­nounce­ment.</p>
    <p>They have also fielded more in­quiries about venue bookings in gen­eral, they said, sig­nalling a po­ten­tial boost in busi­ness.</p>
    <p>Mr Lee Richards, Mil­len­nium Ho­tels and Re­sorts’ vice-pres­i­dent of oper­a­tions for South-east Asia, said: “The re­lax­ation of mea­sures is timely and pos­i­tive for busi­ness.</p>
    <p>“This win-win sit­u­a­tion al­lows ho­tels to gen­er­ate more busi­ness,</p>
    <p>while cou­ples can share their spe­cial day with more fam­ily and friends.”</p>
    <p>A spokesman for Ho­tel Fort Can­ning said: “Fol­low­ing the eas­ing of re­stric­tions, there has been an in­crease of 25 per cent in the num­ber of in­quiries. We re­main op­ti­mistic and fore­see a rise in in­quiries and con­fir­ma­tion of bookings.”</p>
    <p>Still, not all cou­ples are rush­ing to have larger wed­dings.</p>
    <p>En­gi­neer Wes­ley Lum, 25, and prop­erty of­fi­cer Joyce Sim, 24, who will be get­ting mar­ried at Up­per Peirce Reser­voir on Satur­day, de­cided to stick to their plan of hav­ing 40 guests.</p>
    <p>Ms Sim said: “We are think­ing about the safety of our friends and fam­i­lies too – it’s prob­a­bly best to keep the party as small as pos­si­ble.</p>
    <p>“If the Covid-19 sit­u­a­tion gets bet­ter next year, we could have a large wed­ding-an­niver­sary din­ner and cel­e­brate with more peo­ple.”</p>
    <p>All that mat­ters is that they can go ahead with mar­riage plans, Mr Lum said, adding: “The pan­demic has proved that you never know what’s go­ing to hap­pen, or when things will ever re­turn to nor­mal.</p>
    <p>“We just want to be to­gether and have our loved ones there with us.”</p>
