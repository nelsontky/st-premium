    <p>The Mon­e­tary Au­thor­ity of Sin­ga­pore (MAS) is wor­ried about ris­ing trade and tech­nol­ogy ten­sions be­tween the ma­jor pow­ers.</p>
    <p>It be­lieves that ev­ery­one will lose if the con­flict leads to a bi­fur­ca­tion of tech­nol­ogy.</p>
    <p>“The short an­swer is that it is wor­ri­some. I think the last thing we can af­ford is a bi­fur­ca­tion in tech­nol­ogy across the world, be­cause tech­nol­ogy thrives on con­nect­ed­ness, on in­ter­op­er­abil­ity,” MAS man­ag­ing direc­tor Ravi Menon said at a we­bi­nar yesterday.</p>
    <p>US-China re­la­tions have de­te­ri­o­rated rapidly across a broad range of is­sues, with both sides shut­ting down con­sulates, en­gag­ing in diplomatic tus­sles over Hong Kong and Tai­wan and the US push­ing for a ban on Chi­nese tech firms in­clud­ing ByteDance, owner of TikTok. That has kin­dled global fears of a new Cold War that might drag trade and the global econ­omy deeper into re­ces­sion.</p>
    <p>Mr Menon said that while the trade con­flict is also wor­ry­ing, it is in some ways eas­ier to han­dle.</p>
    <p>“You have seen in the last few years how ag­ile many of the busi­nesses have been in re­con­fig­ur­ing the sup­ply chains, mak­ing ad­just­ments to over­come the bar­ri­ers.</p>
    <p>“This is the great in­ge­nu­ity in the pri­vate sec­tor that al­lows them to live with, not with a full-blown trade war, but with the kind of trade con­flicts we have seen.”</p>
    <p>The cen­tral bank chief said he was more wor­ried about the con­flicts over tech­nol­ogy. “Un­like trade, trad­ing goods es­pe­cially, when it comes to tech­nol­ogy, a lot of it is so deeply em­bed­ded in the prod­ucts and ser­vices... The chips come from some­where and soft­ware from else­where. How do you dis­en­tan­gle what comes from where?</p>
    <p>“So un­like trade where you can draw sharp lines, tech­nol­ogy is em­bed­ded and in­ter­twined in much of what we do. If there is go­ing to be a bi­fur­ca­tion, or pro­hi­bi­tions on us­ing some tech­nolo­gies or em­ploy­ing cer­tain tech­nolo­gies, that’s go­ing to be hugely dif­fi­cult to han­dle,” he said.</p>
    <p>Mr Menon be­lieves that if tech pro­hi­bi­tions were to be im­posed, some in­no­va­tors might take them as a chal­lenge. “If you are go­ing to have this bi­fur­ca­tion, how do you get around it? How do you cre­ate sys­tems and ar­chi­tec­ture that are open and in­ter­op­er­a­ble (and) still not break any rules or laws? I don’t know, but maybe that’s an­other thing we’ll have to think very hard about.”</p>
