    <p>The two games from the first week­end of the sea­son have not been made up. It took un­til last Thurs­day for the Pre­mier League to find a win­dow: Burn­ley-United and City-Villa will now be played on Jan 12 and 20 re­spec­tively.</p>
    <p>On the face of it, the Pre­mier League’s de­ci­sion was an easy and an ob­vi­ous one. Manch­ester City and Manch­ester United had fin­ished last sea­son late, thanks to their com­mit­ments in the Cham­pi­ons League and Europa League re­spec­tively.</p>
    <p>To en­sure that both teams would have a sim­i­lar break be­tween cam­paigns as all of their ri­vals, the Pre­mier League de­creed that they would start the new sea­son a week later than ev­ery­one else.</p>
    <p>The league’s om­nipo­tent fix­ture com­puter had drawn City against As­ton Villa and United against Burn­ley for that first week­end of the sea­son; those two games would have to be post­poned.</p>
    <p>All of this, so far, makes sense. What hap­pens next does not.</p>
    <p>Know­ing that its teams were fac­ing a com­pacted sched­ule any­way, the Pre­mier League could have de­cided that Burn­ley and Villa might as well play one an­other on open­ing week­end.</p>
    <p>That may have raised some lo­gis­ti­cal chal­lenges – polic­ing, sched­ul­ing – but hardly in­sur­mount­able ones, par­tic­u­larly with fans still locked out of sta­di­ums.</p>
    <p>The ben­e­fit, of hav­ing only one game, rather than two, to slot in later in a busy year far out­weighed the cost. But that is not how foot­ball works, not even in a pan­demic. Burn­ley did not play Villa.</p>
    <p>The two games from the first week­end of the sea­son have not been made up. It took un­til last Thurs­day for the Pre­mier League to find a win­dow: Burn­ley-United and City-Villa will now be played on Jan 12 and 20 re­spec­tively.</p>
    <p>That may seem a triv­ial is­sue, lit­tle more than a mi­nor mis­step, one that can doubt­less be ex­plained by the myr­iad com­plex­i­ties of sched­ul­ing a sport­ing sea­son and will be eas­ily re­solved once the field in the do­mes­tic cup com­pe­ti­tions is thinned a lit­tle.</p>
    <p>And, in some senses, that is all it is. But it is also an in­struc­tive ex­am­ple of how the Pre­mier League thinks, how per­va­sive is its be­lief in its own re­lent­less­ness, how del­i­cate and vul­ner­a­ble this sea­son re­mains.</p>
    <p>The fact that Burn­ley did not play Villa on open­ing day en­cap­su­lates foot­ball’s my­opia and its hubris.</p>
    <p>The Pre­mier League lost three more games last week, on top of its first de­lay – Villa-New­cas­tle – last month.</p>
    <p>First, City’s trip to Ever­ton was post­poned due to a coro­n­avirus out­break. Then Ful­ham’s visit to Tot­ten­ham was also axed, fol­lowed by Burn­ley v Ful­ham for the same rea­sons.</p>
    <p>Those clubs will, it is safe to as­sume, not be the last to suf­fer from Covid-19.</p>
    <p>The sit­u­a­tion in the Foot­ball League, which gov­erns the sec­ond, third and fourth tiers of foot­ball in Eng­land, is even worse, with a string of post­pone­ments.</p>
    <p>There have been calls from some med­i­cal de­part­ments for a two-week “cir­cuit breaker” pause to the sea­son to avoid play­ers be­ing over­loaded by a back­log of matches in the spring.</p>
    <p>It does not feel as if any of this was es­pe­cially dif­fi­cult to fore­see. Foot­ball can­not be blamed, of course, for fail­ing to an­tic­i­pate the scale of the sec­ond wave of the pan­demic in Bri­tain or any place else, or for the ap­pear­ance of a par­tic­u­larly vir­u­lent mu­ta­tion of the virus in Eng­land.</p>
    <p>But it should not have re­quired the clar­ity of hind­sight to project that cases might rise in the win­ter, that the long-an­tic­i­pated sec­ond wave might have some ef­fect on foot­ball, that the bub­bles the sport was re­ly­ing on to play through might not prove en­tirely im­per­me­able, that some sort of con­tin­gency plan might be needed.</p>
    <p>It is not just that there is lit­tle room in the cal­en­dar set aside to play post­poned matches. Just three week­ends in the English sea­son have been set aside for teams to make up games they have missed, but only if they are elim­i­nated from the do­mes­tic cups first.</p>
    <p>Yet foot­ball seems woe­fully un­der­pre­pared for some­thing that should have been wholly pre­dictable.</p>
