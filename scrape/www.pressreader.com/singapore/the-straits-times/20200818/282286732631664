    <p>NEW YORK • McDon­ald’s Corp’s former chief ex­ec­u­tive of­fi­cer Steve Easter­brook fired back at his former com­pany for su­ing to claw back tens of mil­lions of dol­lars in com­pen­sa­tion, deny­ing com­pany claims that he cov­ered up sexual re­la­tion­ships with sub­or­di­nates.</p>
    <p>McDon­ald’s of­fi­cials claimed that af­ter fir­ing Mr Easter­brook l ast year, they found new in­for­ma­tion that showed the former top ex­ec­u­tive “con­cealed ev­i­dence and lied about his wrong­do­ing”. Mr Easter­brook says McDon­ald’s had the in­for­ma­tion about his re­la­tion­ships with em­ploy­ees when it ne­go­ti­ated his sep­a­ra­tion agree­ment.</p>
    <p>“McDon­ald’s – a so­phis­ti­cated en­tity rep­re­sented by nu­mer­ous in­ter­nal and ex­ter­nal ex­perts when it en­tered into the sep­a­ra­tion agree­ment – is aware it can­not cred­i­bly al­lege a breach of con­tract claim,” said Mr Easter­brook’s lawyers last Fri­day in a court fil­ing, seek­ing to have the law­suit thrown out. “In­stead, it im­prop­erly seeks to man­u­fac­ture claims for a breach of fidu­ciary duty or fraud.”</p>
    <p>It is the lat­est salvo in a le­gal bat­tle over Mr Easter­brook’s ouster, which was cov­ered by the sev­er­ance deal al­low­ing him to keep stock awards worth over US$37 mil­lion (S$51 mil­lion), plus US$675,000 in sev­er­ance and health in­sur­ance ben­e­fits.</p>
    <p>“McDon­ald’s stands by its com­plaint, both the fac­tual as­ser­tions and the court in which it was filed,” the com­pany said.</p>
    <p>Mr Easter­brook also claims agree­ments cov­er­ing stock grants tar­geted by the com­pany must be heard in Illi­nois courts, where McDon­ald’s is based.</p>
    <p>He also ac­cused the chain of fil­ing the suit know­ing he could not im­me­di­ately re­spond be­cause of a gag clause in the agree­ment. “McDon­ald’s Cor­po­ra­tion filed a mer­it­less – and mis­lead­ing – law­suit in the wrong forum,” his lawyers said.</p>
    <p>While McDon­ald’s is based in Illi­nois, it is in­cor­po­rated in Delaware. The chancery court in the state is the premier venue for re­solv­ing high­pro­file cor­po­rate dis­putes.</p>
    <p>In re­turn for his sev­er­ance pack­age, Mr Easter­brook agreed to a two-year non-com­pete clause spec­i­fy­ing over 40 com­pa­nies that he could not join. He was also re­quired to write a let­ter “to em­ploy­ees ac­knowl­edg­ing that he made a mis­take”, said the fil­ing.</p>
