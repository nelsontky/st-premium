    <p>Lead­ers of small and medium-sized en­ter­prises (SMEs) here will learn how to drive change and growth in their com­pa­nies as part of a new ini­tia­tive, the En­ter­prise Lead­er­ship for Trans­for­ma­tion pro­gramme. The in­au­gu­ral run will see 60 par­tic­i­pants from 38 lo­cal SMEs un­der­take a one-year cur­ricu­lum.</p>
    <p>We can equip you with the re­sources, we can pro­vide you with ac­cess to ad­vice from the part­ners on board today. But ul­ti­mately... you and your lead­er­ship teams are the ones that will make it hap­pen.</p>
    <p>TRADE AND IN­DUS­TRY MIN­IS­TER CHAN CHUN SING, call­ing on busi­ness lead­ers to lead the trans­for­ma­tion of their re­spec­tive busi­nesses.</p>
    <p>Lead­ers of small and medi­um­sized en­ter­prises (SMEs) here will learn how to drive change and growth in their com­pa­nies as part of a new ini­tia­tive.</p>
    <p>The En­ter­prise Lead­er­ship for Trans­for­ma­tion pro­gramme, which was an­nounced at Bud­get 2020, was launched yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The in­au­gu­ral run will see 60 par­tic­i­pants from 38 lo­cal SMEs un­der­take a one-year cur­ricu­lum de­signed to ad­dress knowl­edge gaps in lead­er­ship and busi­ness fun­da­men­tals, and pro­vide them with spe­cific guid­ance in ar­eas such as drawing up ex­e­cu­tion road maps.</p>
    <p>They will also gain ac­cess to dif­fer­ent per­spec­tives through peer learn­ing and en­gage­ment with suc­cess­ful en­trepreneur­s and in­dus­try ex­perts.</p>
    <p>This could pro­vide ex­po­sure to po­ten­tial col­lab­o­ra­tion op­por­tu­ni­ties within Sin­ga­pore and the re­gion, said En­ter­prise Sin­ga­pore, which is over­see­ing the pro­gramme.</p>
    <p>Speak­ing at the launch at Sands Expo and Con­ven­tion Cen­tre, Trade and In­dus­try Min­is­ter Chan Chun Sing said there is no go­ing back to the pre-Covid-19 world, and a col­lab­o­ra­tive ef­fort is needed to help firms move for­ward and adapt to the new en­vi­ron­ment.</p>
    <p>“The Gov­ern­ment can es­tab­lish the macro en­vi­ron­ment, but we need busi­ness lead­ers to lead the trans­for­ma­tion of your re­spec­tive busi­nesses,” he said.</p>
    <p>“We can equip you with the re­sources, we can pro­vide you with ac­cess to ad­vice from the part­ners on board today. But ul­ti­mately... you and your lead­er­ship teams are the ones that will make it hap­pen.”</p>
    <p>In his speech, Mr Chan out­lined the Gov­ern­ment’s three-pronged strat­egy to grow the econ­omy and cre­ate good jobs.</p>
    <p>He said it will nur­ture the start-up ecosys­tem as well as fo­cus on new growth op­por­tu­ni­ties and an­chor these ca­pa­bil­i­ties in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>The Gov­ern­ment will also iden­tify and at­tract strate­gic multi­na­tional cor­po­ra­tions to move here.</p>
    <p>At the same time, it will en­cour­age more per­va­sive and deeper busi­ness trans­for­ma­tion to en­sure com­pa­nies are more re­silient and able to seize op­por­tu­ni­ties.</p>
    <p>The lead­er­ship pro­gramme is one way in which the Gov­ern­ment is sup­port­ing busi­ness lead­ers in trans­for­ma­tion ef­forts, Mr Chan said.</p>
    <p>Busi­nesses will be given sup­port and op­por­tu­ni­ties to take their com­pa­nies for­ward, he said, “be­cause ul­ti­mately, the giv­ing of grants and sub­si­dies can only help busi­nesses to go so far”.</p>
    <p>“The real break­through in the busi­nesses will come from your ef­forts – when you have new ideas about new mar­kets, new prod­ucts and ser­vices, new ways of pro­duc­ing your goods... and so forth.”</p>
    <p>Par­tic­i­pants in the first run come from di­verse sec­tors, such as man­u­fac­tur­ing, in­for­ma­tion and com­mu­ni­ca­tions tech­nol­ogy, and the life­style and con­sumer in­dus­tries.</p>
    <p>The ma­jor­ity of the par­tic­i­pat­ing com­pa­nies have ex­panded their busi­ness over­seas and are look­ing to pur­sue fur­ther growth by ei­ther deep­en­ing their ca­pa­bil­i­ties or ex­pand­ing into more mar­kets, said En­ter­prise Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>The pro­gramme is of­fered in col­lab­o­ra­tion with in­sti­tutes of higher learn­ing, which will work with pri­vate-sec­tor part­ners such as fi­nan­cial in­sti­tu­tions to sup­port the busi­ness lead­ers.</p>
    <p>The Na­tional Univer­sity of Sin­ga­pore and Sin­ga­pore Man­age­ment Univer­sity are part­ner­ing En­ter­prise Sin­ga­pore for this first run, while the Sin­ga­pore Univer­sity of So­cial Sciences will take in its first co­hort in the first quar­ter of next year.</p>
    <p>About 900 SME lead­ers are ex­pected to un­dergo the pro­gramme over three years. The course costs about $30,000 for each par­tic­i­pant, but up to 90 per cent of the fees can be sub­sidised with Skill­sFu­ture En­ter­prise Credit.</p>
