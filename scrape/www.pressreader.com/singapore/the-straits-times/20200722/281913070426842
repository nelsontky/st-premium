    <p>On July 13, US Sec­re­tary of State Mike Pom­peo made an im­por­tant state­ment on the United States’ po­si­tion on mar­itime claims in the South China Sea.</p>
    <p>His state­ment was a fol­low-up to the US note ver­bale to China on Dec 28, 2016, and to the po­si­tion out­lined by the US in its let­ter to the United Na­tions Sec­re­tary-Gen­eral last month, in re­sponse to China’s ob­jec­tions to a Malaysian move to ex­tend its con­ti­nen­tal shelf in De­cem­ber last year.</p>
    <p>The June 1 let­ter re­it­er­ated pre­vi­ous state­ments that the US re­jects any Chi­nese claim to “his­toric rights” in the South China Sea be­cause such a claim is in­com­pat­i­ble with the 1982 UN Con­ven­tion on the Law of the Sea (Unclos).</p>
    <p>The let­ter also stated that the US re­jects any claim to mar­itime zones or en­ti­tle­ments from fea­tures in the South China Sea that are com­pletely sub­merged (like James Shoal and Mac­cles­field Bank) or from fea­tures that are low-tide el­e­va­tions rather than is­lands (like Mis­chief Reef and Sec­ond Thomas Shoal).</p>
    <p>The let­ter also stated that the US re­jects any claim by China to mar­itime zones de­rived from treat­ing is­land groups in the South China Sea as a col­lec­tive (Four Shas/Nan­hai Zhu­dao) be­cause there is no pro­vi­sion in Unclos per­mit­ting the draw­ing of straight base­lines around dis­persed off­shore is­lands.</p>
    <p>WHAT’S NEW IN POM­PEO’S STATE­MENT</p>
    <p>The Pom­peo state­ment went fur­ther in clar­i­fy­ing the US po­si­tion on China’s claims in the South China Sea.</p>
    <p>First, it states that the US sup­ports the 2016 de­ci­sion of the ar­bi­tral tri­bunal that none of the in­di­vid­ual is­lands in the Spratly Is­lands are ca­pa­ble of gen­er­at­ing an ex­clu­sive eco­nomic zone (EEZ) and con­ti­nen­tal shelf of their own.</p>
    <p>Unclos de­fines an is­land as a nat­u­rally formed area of land sur­rounded by and above water at high tide. All is­lands are en­ti­tled to a 12 nau­ti­cal mile ter­ri­to­rial sea, but they are en­ti­tled to an EEZ and con­ti­nen­tal shelf only if in their nat­u­ral state they could sus­tain hu­man habi­ta­tion or eco­nomic life of their own.</p>
    <p>The ar­bi­tral tri­bunal in the South China Sea case held that Scar­bor­ough Shoal and none of the is­lands in the Spratly Is­lands are en­ti­tled to an EEZ and con­ti­nen­tal shelf of their own.</p>
    <p>This in­cludes Taip­ing, the largest nat­u­ral is­land in the Spratlys that is oc­cu­pied by Tai­wan, as well as the largest is­lands oc­cu­pied by Malaysia, the Philip­pines, Viet­nam and China.</p>
    <p>Sec­ond, the Pom­peo state­ment clar­i­fied the US po­si­tion by stat­ing that it re­jects any mar­itime claims of China in the EEZ of other Asean mem­ber states bor­der­ing the</p>
    <p>South China Sea.</p>
    <p>It states that the US re­jects any Chi­nese claim in the wa­ters sur­round­ing Van­guard Bank off the coast of Viet­nam and Lu­co­nia Shoals off the coast of Malaysia, in the wa­ters in the EEZ of Brunei or off the Natuna Is­lands of In­done­sia.</p>
    <p>The US also states that any ac­tion by China to ha­rass fish­ing or hy­dro­car­bon de­vel­op­ment by the Asean states in these wa­ters – or any ac­tion by China to carry out such ac­tiv­i­ties uni­lat­er­ally – is un­law­ful.</p>
    <p>In other words, the US po­si­tion is that the pro­vi­sions in Unclos as in­ter­preted by the ar­bi­tral tri­bunal in the South China Sea case es­tab­lishes the le­gal regime that ap­plies in the mar­itime zones of all of the states bor­der­ing the South China Sea.</p>
    <p>ASEAN ON UNCLOS AND THE SOUTH CHINA SEA</p>
    <p>The US po­si­tion on the im­por­tance of Unclos in the South China Sea is con­sis­tent with state­ments is­sued by Asean lead­ers this year.</p>
    <p>The press state­ment by the chair­man of the Asean For­eign Min­is­ters’ Re­treat in Jan­uary says that Unclos is the ba­sis for de­ter­min­ing sovereignt­y, sov­er­eign rights and le­git­i­mate in­ter­ests over mar­itime ar­eas and the over­ar­ch­ing frame­work of le­gal or­der for the seas that must be re­spected by all coun­tries.</p>
    <p>In addition, the 2020 Asean Sum­mit lead­ers’ state­ment reaf­firmed that Unclos is the ba­sis for de­ter­min­ing mar­itime en­ti­tle­ments, sov­er­eign rights, ju­ris­dic­tion and le­git­i­mate in­ter­ests over mar­itime zones, and that Unclos sets out the le­gal frame­work within which all ac­tiv­i­ties in the oceans and seas must be car­ried out.</p>
    <p>The US state­ment and those of Asean lead­ers on the im­por­tance of Unclos are also con­sis­tent with the re­sponses this year of In­done­sia, the Philip­pines and Viet­nam to China’s ob­jec­tion to Malaysia’s sub­mis­sion to the Com­mis­sion on the Lim­its of the Con­ti­nen­tal Shelf.</p>
    <p>Bei­jing protested that Malaysia’s at­tempt se­ri­ously in­fringed China’s sov­er­eign rights and ju­ris­dic­tion in the South China Sea.</p>
    <p>In their notes ver­bale to the UN Sec­re­tary-Gen­eral, all three Asean mem­ber states em­pha­sised the im­por­tance of Unclos as in­ter­preted by the de­ci­sion of the ar­bi­tral tri­bunal in the South China Sea case.</p>
    <p>POS­SI­BLE U.S. AC­TIONS</p>
    <p>One ques­tion that arises from Mr Pom­peo’s state­ment is whether the US will take spe­cific ac­tion in the South China Sea to chal­lenge China’s claims to re­sources in the mar­itime zones of other states which the US be­lieves are un­law­ful.</p>
    <p>US free­dom of nav­i­ga­tion op­er­a­tions (Fonops) are ef­fec­tive in chal­leng­ing re­stric­tions on nav­i­ga­tion rights or re­stric­tions on naval op­er­a­tions re­sult­ing from mar­itime claims that are con­trary to Unclos.</p>
    <p>Un­der the Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion, Fonops have been in­creas­ingly utilised to chal­lenge China’s straight base­lines around the Para­cel Is­lands, claims of a ter­ri­to­rial sea from low-tide el­e­va­tions, or re­quire­ments that for­eign ships seek au­tho­ri­sa­tion be­fore ex­er­cis­ing the right of in­no­cent pas­sage.</p>
    <p>How­ever, it is dif­fi­cult to con­duct a Fonop to chal­lenge the le­gal­ity of what you be­lieve is an un­law­ful claim to nat­u­ral re­sources in the EEZ or on the con­ti­nen­tal shelf of an­other state. It is the coastal state that has the right to chal­lenge Chi­nese ships that it be­lieves are il­le­gally fish­ing in its EEZ or con­duct­ing a seis­mic sur­vey on its con­ti­nen­tal shelf.</p>
    <p>How­ever, the US could track and mon­i­tor the ac­tiv­i­ties of Chi­nese ships in the EEZ of the Asean states. It could share this in­for­ma­tion with the coastal state and make pub­lic state­ments ob­ject­ing to the ac­tions of China that are con­trary to in­ter­na­tional law.</p>
    <p>One sit­u­a­tion in which the US could have a le­gal right to in­ter­vene would be if a US com­pany had a con­ces­sion from a coastal state to ex­ploit hy­dro­car­bon re­sources in its EEZ in the South China Sea. If Chi­nese ships were to in­ter­fere with the ac­tiv­i­ties of a US com­pany, the US could ar­guably in­ter­vene to pro­tect the com­pany. How­ever, such in­ter­ven­tion would be un­likely with­out the per­mis­sion or ac­qui­es­cence of the coastal state.</p>
    <p>An­other pos­si­ble ac­tion by the US was al­luded to by US As­sis­tant Sec­re­tary of State David Stil­well at a con­fer­ence the day af­ter the Pom­peo state­ment. Mr Stil­well stated that Chi­nese state-owned en­ter­prises have been used to at­tempt to en­force China’s il­le­gal claims in the South China Sea.</p>
    <p>Ob­servers have sug­gested that Mr Stil­well’s state­ment in­di­cates that the US is con­sid­er­ing the prospect of im­pos­ing uni­lat­eral sanc­tions against these Chi­nese state en­ter­prises. Such uni­lat­eral ac­tions by the US would not re­quire the sup­port of any Asean mem­ber states.</p>
    <p>BE­YOND ASEAN</p>
    <p>Will Asean en­cour­age other states to sup­port its po­si­tion?</p>
    <p>Asean mem­ber states are likely to en­cour­age more states to sup­port the Asean po­si­tion on the im­por­tance of Unclos and the 2016 ar­bi­tral award in ad­dress­ing the is­sue of rights and ju­ris­dic­tion over the nat­u­ral re­sources in the South China Sea.</p>
    <p>They can ar­gue that it is the com­mon in­ter­est of all states that are party to Unclos to sup­port the po­si­tion that the dis­putes over ac­cess to re­sources in the South China Sea should be re­solved in ac­cor­dance with the rules-based or­der set out in Unclos.</p>
    <p>IM­PACT ON THE</p>
    <p>CODE OF CON­DUCT TALKS</p>
    <p>The Code of Con­duct (COC) ne­go­ti­a­tions are un­likely to re­solve the fun­da­men­tal dif­fer­ences be­tween China and the Asean states on rights and ju­ris­dic­tion over the nat­u­ral re­sources in the South China Sea.</p>
    <p>How­ever, the ne­go­ti­a­tions can pro­duce agree­ment on mech­a­nisms to re­duce ten­sions and to min­imise the risk of armed conflict in the South China Sea.</p>
    <p>The COC ne­go­ti­a­tions could also pro­duce mech­a­nisms to co­op­er­ate on other is­sues of com­mon in­ter­est, such as on marine sci­en­tific re­search and pro­tec­tion and preser­va­tion of the marine en­vi­ron­ment.</p>
