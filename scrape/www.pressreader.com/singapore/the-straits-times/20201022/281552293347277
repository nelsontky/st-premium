    <p>More than 100 peo­ple have died and 20 others are miss­ing in cen­tral Viet­nam fol­low­ing weeks of se­vere flood­ing and land­slides, the au­thor­i­ties said yes­ter­day as the coun­try braced it­self for yet another storm.</p>
    <p>HANOI • More than 100 peo­ple have died and 20 others are miss­ing in cen­tral Viet­nam fol­low­ing weeks of se­vere flood­ing and land­slides, the au­thor­i­ties said yes­ter­day, as the coun­try braced it­self for yet another storm this week­end.</p>
    <p>About 178,000 homes have been sub­merged by flood­wa­ters, ac­cord­ing to the In­ter­na­tional Fed­er­a­tion of Red Cross and Red Cres­cent So­ci­eties, with res­cuers mount­ing a des­per­ate bid to get food and drink­ing wa­ter to those cut off.</p>
    <p>Roads, in­fra­struc­ture and crops in the cen­tral re­gion have also been dev­as­tated, the char­ity added, warn­ing that hun­dreds of thou­sands would need hous­ing and in­come sup­port in the com­ing weeks.</p>
    <p>Ms Nguyen Thi Xuan Thu of the Viet­nam Red Cross So­ci­ety said the floods are “some of the worst we have seen in decades”.</p>
    <p>At least 111 peo­ple have been killed, the dis­as­ter man­age­ment au­thor­ity said, while nearly 200,000 have been evac­u­ated.</p>
    <p>Among those dead are 22 sol­diers who were en­gulfed in a land­slide on Sun­day in Quang Tri prov­ince, and 13 res­cuers who had tried to save work­ers from a hy­dropower plant.</p>
    <p>A search team is still try­ing to find 15 of the miss­ing plant work­ers, who were also caught in a land­slide.</p>
    <p>Al­though flood­wa­ters have be­gun to re­cede in some ar­eas, im­ages on state me­dia showed vil­lages across the re­gion that were still sub­merged and a hos­pi­tal badly flooded in Quang Binh, with wa­ter pool­ing around its beds.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, more rain is fore­cast to hit the area over the week­end as Storm Saudel blows in from the South China Sea.</p>
    <p>Viet­nam is fre­quently lashed by harsh weather in the rainy sea­son be­tween June and Novem­ber, and cen­tral coastal prov­inces are the most af­fected ar­eas.</p>
    <p>Over 130 peo­ple were re­ported dead or miss­ing in nat­u­ral dis­as­ters around the coun­try last year, the Gen­eral Statis­tics Of­fice said.</p>
    <p>Viet­nam’s neigh­bour, Cam­bo­dia, has also suf­fered badly from flood­ing in re­cent weeks.</p>
    <p>The death toll jumped to 34 yes­ter­day, Cam­bo­dian Prime Min­is­ter Hun Sen said, with more than 400,000 peo­ple af­fected.</p>
    <p>The north-western prov­ince of Ban­teay Meanchey has ex­pe­ri­enced its worst flood­ing in 70 years, the leader added.</p>
