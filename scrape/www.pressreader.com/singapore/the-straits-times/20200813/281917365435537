    <p>NEW YORK/WASH­ING­TON • Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump’s ex­ec­u­tive or­der ban­ning China’s Tik­Tok could pre­vent US app stores from of­fer­ing the pop­u­lar short­video app and make ad­ver­tis­ing on the plat­form il­le­gal, ac­cord­ing to a White House doc­u­ment seen by Reuters.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump signed an or­der last week pro­hibit­ing deals with Tik­Tok if its par­ent ByteDance does not reach a deal to di­vest it in 45 days.</p>
    <p>It did not spec­ify the scope of the ban, stat­ing only that the De­part­ment of Com­merce would de­fine which trans­ac­tions would be barred at the end of the 45 days.</p>
    <p>The White House doc­u­ment, sent to sup­port­ers last week, pro­vides in­sight into the Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion’s think­ing.</p>
    <p>It shows that the US govern­ment is con­sid­er­ing dis­rupt­ing key as­pects of Tik­Tok’s op­er­a­tions and fund­ing, amid con­cerns over the safety of per­sonal data that the app han­dles.</p>
    <p>“Pro­hib­ited trans­ac­tions may in­clude, for ex­am­ple, agree­ments to make the Tik­Tok app avail­able on app stores... pur­chas­ing ad­ver­tis­ing on Tik­Tok, and ac­cept­ing terms of ser­vice to down­load the Tik­Tok app onto a user de­vice,” the doc­u­ment states.</p>
    <p>A source fa­mil­iar with the White House doc­u­ment ver­i­fied its au­then­tic­ity. Tik­Tok did not re­spond to a re­quest for com­ment.</p>
    <p>Some tech­nol­ogy in­dus­try ex­perts said elim­i­nat­ing Tik­Tok’s abil­ity to be of­fered on Ap­ple and Google owner Al­pha­bet’s app stores, which in turn al­low it to be down­loaded on iPhone and An­droid smart­phones, could crip­ple the app’s growth.</p>
    <p>“That kills Tik­Tok in the US,” said cy­ber-se­cu­rity ex­pert James Lewis of the Wash­ing­ton-based Cen­tre for Strate­gic and In­ter­na­tional Stud­ies.</p>
    <p>“If they want to grow, these rules are a huge ob­sta­cle.”</p>
    <p>But he added that the US govern­ment might not be able to pre­vent Amer­i­cans from down­load­ing Tik­Tok from for­eign web­sites.</p>
    <p>Ap­ple and Al­pha­bet did not re­spond to re­quests for com­ment.</p>
    <p>Fol­low­ing Mr Trump’s ex­ec­u­tive or­der last week, Tik­Tok told ad­ver­tis­ers it would still hon­our planned ad cam­paigns, re­fund any that it can­not ful­fil, and work with ma­jor in­flu­encers to mi­grate to other plat­forms in the event of a ban.</p>
    <p>Some ad­ver­tis­ers told Reuters they were draft­ing con­tin­gency plans and con­sid­er­ing other apps for their mar­ket­ing.</p>
    <p>Mi­crosoft has been lead­ing ne­go­ti­a­tions to ac­quire the North Amer­ica, Aus­tralia and New Zealand op­er­a­tions of Tik­Tok un­der the su­per­vi­sion of the Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion. A suc­cess­ful deal would make ban­ning trans­ac­tions with Tik­Tok moot.</p>
    <p>The White House doc­u­ment seen by Reuters is not clear on whether the US would im­ple­ment a sim­i­lar crack­down on WeChat, the so­cial me­dia app owned by China’s Ten­cent Hold­ings that Mr Trump also sought to ban in an ex­ec­u­tive or­der on last week.</p>
    <p>Tik­Tok, which has said it is ex­plor­ing le­gal chal­lenges to Mr Trump’s or­der, has 100 mil­lion ac­tive users in the US, and is espe­cially pop­u­lar with teenagers.</p>
    <p>The com­pany has also said that Amer­i­can user data is safely stored in the United States and Sin­ga­pore, and that it would not hand over such in­for­ma­tion to the Chi­nese govern­ment.</p>
