    <p>A con­struc­tion worker was car­ry­ing out his du­ties on the first storey of a site at Shaw Plaza shop­ping mall on Nov 14 last year when he fell nearly 5m through a frag­ile floor cov­er­ing that was hid­den by con­crete dust.</p>
    <p>Mr Ra­makr­ish­nan Ravichan­dran was pro­nounced dead at Tan Tock Seng Hospi­tal later that morn­ing.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing an in­quiry yes­ter­day into his death, Coro­ner Prem Raj said the 30-year-old In­dian na­tional had stepped on a gyp­sum board which gave way as it was not meant to sup­port a man’s weight.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to the United States-based Gyp­sum As­so­ci­a­tion’s web­site, such a board is com­monly known as a dry­wall and is used for wall, ceil­ing as well as par­ti­tion sys­tems.</p>
    <p>Coro­ner Prem said none of the work­ers at the site in Balestier Road had been aware of the frag­ile floor cov­er­ing and they were not alerted to it.</p>
    <p>Mr Ra­makr­ish­nan, who was wear­ing a safety hel­met, plum­meted about 5m to the base­ment and was found ly­ing face down on the ground.</p>
    <p>Coro­ner Prem said Mr Ra­makr­ish­nan died of mul­ti­ple in­juries, in­clud­ing a frac­tured skull. His death was an “un­for­tu­nate work­place ac­ci­dent”, the coro­ner added.</p>
    <p>He also said floor open­ings should be cov­ered with more se­cure items such as con­crete slabs and warn­ing signs have to be put up in the vicin­ity if gyp­sum boards are used.</p>
    <p>Mr Ra­makr­ish­nan was em­ployed by Ex­press 21, which works on elec­tri­cal en­gi­neer­ing and struc­tured ca­bling projects for build­ings, among other things.</p>
    <p>News re­ports said he had been mar­ried for less than a year be­fore the tragedy oc­curred.</p>
    <p>His body was flown back to his home­town of Vel­lore in the state of Tamil Nadu on Nov 16 last year. His fam­ily, in­clud­ing his wife, wid­owed mother and sib­lings, held the fu­neral rites that same day.</p>
    <p>His cousin, Mr Mu­ruge­san Letchu­manan, 34, had told Sin­ga­pore’s Tamil Murasu news­pa­per: “His life as a mar­ried man just started and he did not have any chil­dren yet. No one can ac­cept the loss.”</p>
    <p>Mr Ra­makr­ish­nan’s older brother Parthipan, 32, who also worked as a con­struc­tion worker in Sin­ga­pore, had said: “You can ask any­one in my vil­lage, no one would say any­thing bad about him. He was al­ways smil­ing and was friendly to ev­ery­one.”</p>
