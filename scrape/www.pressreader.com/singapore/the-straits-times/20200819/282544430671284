    <p>Mr Mo­hamed Razif has been in and out of prison five times since 2000, mostly for house­break­ing of­fences.</p>
    <p>When­ever he was re­leased, he promised his fam­ily he would not go back into the slam­mer. But when he re­peat­edly turned back to crime, they be­gan to doubt his words.</p>
    <p>His de­sire to re­gain his fam­ily’s trust mo­ti­vated him to write a song, ti­tled Flag Of Vic­tory, for the 2018 edi­tion of the Yel­low Rib­bon Song­writ­ing Com­pe­ti­tion, while he was an in­mate at Changi Prison Com­plex.</p>
    <p>WATCH IT / MU­SIC FOR THE SOUL – BE­YOND SEC­OND CHANCES</p>
    <p>8pm to­day</p>
    <p>This is one of five orig­i­nal works which will be per­formed at Mu­sic For The Soul – Be­yond Sec­ond Chances, a con­cert that will be broad­cast on­line at 8pm to­day as part of Red Dot Au­gust, a se­ries of free per­for­mances pre­sented by Es­planade – Theatres on the Bay.</p>
    <p>“The song is about my life jour­ney,” says Mr Razif, 38, who is now a fi­nan­cial con­sul­tant in the oil and gas in­dus­try. “I want to make a new life for my­self and ul­ti­mately climb the moun­tain of life and plant the flag of vic­tory at the sum­mit. I also want to get my fam­ily to trust me again.”</p>
    <p>In the pre-recorded on­line con­cert, he will sing and play the ca­jon with four other ex-of­fend­ers: Mr Af­fandi Meskam, 41; Mr Zulk­i­fli Ab­dul Rah­man, 41; Mr Tan Wil Khiam, 57; and Mr Am Yu­soff, 46. Their group is called the Yel­low Rib­bon Per­form­ing Arts Cen­tre Alumni, named after a fa­cil­ity in Changi Prison Com­plex ded­i­cated to nur­tur­ing in­mates’ mu­si­cal tal­ent.</p>
    <p>They met in prison and now ad­vo­cate for sec­ond chances for former in­mates in the com­mu­nity.</p>
    <p>The other songs featured in the con­cert were writ­ten by other in­mates for the Yel­low Rib­bon Song­writ­ing Com­pe­ti­tion over the years.</p>
    <p>The song­writ­ing pro­gramme was in­tro­duced in 2004 as part of the Yel­low Rib­bon Cre­ative Fes­ti­val for in­mates to show­case their po­etry and song­writ­ing tal­ent. The con­test is now jointly or­gan­ised by the Com­posers and Au­thors So­ci­ety of</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore and the Yel­low Rib­bon Project.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing the con­cert, the ex-of­fend­ers will per­form with mu­si­cians Aaron Matthew Lim and Peng Chi Sheng, who are co-founders of Sin­ga­pore mu­sic school In­tune Mu­sic and have been coach­ing in­mates since 2014.</p>
    <p>Mr Lim, 42, says the lessons taught – which in­clude in­struc­tion in gui­tar, drums, key­board, singing and mu­sic the­ory – pro­vide in­mates with skills which they can use to seek mu­sic-re­lated ca­reers after their re­lease.</p>
    <p>After their re­lease, some former of­fend­ers got in touch with both mu­si­cians last year to col­lab­o­rate on per­for­mances, re­sult­ing in the con­cert.</p>
    <p>One of the per­form­ers, Mr Tan, who was pre­vi­ously jailed for drug of­fences and is now a de­liv­ery driver, will play the pi­ano dur­ing the show. “My favourite song is Changes be­cause it ac­knowl­edges that no­body is per­fect, but we are try­ing to change and be­come better,” he says.</p>
    <p>While he was be­hind bars, he says, mu­sic taught him lessons such as pa­tience and fo­cus­ing on the task at hand. “I learnt that when we prac­tise our in­stru­ments, we will get better with time. And in life, when we fo­cus on do­ing the right things, we will lead a good life.”</p>
    <p>Yel­low Rib­bon Per­form­ing Arts Cen­tre Alumni mem­bers (above, from left) Zulk­i­fli Ab­dul Rah­man, Mo­hamed Razif, Af­fandi Meskam, Tan Wil Khiam and Am Yu­soff.</p>
    <p>1</p>
    <p>Mr Zulk­i­fli Ab­dul Rah­man: “This song is about the dif­fi­cul­ties ex-in­mates face after re­lease, when we try our best to stick to the right path and not go back to our old ways.</p>
    <p>“I would like to in­spire our lis­ten­ers to al­ways keep try­ing and never give up. Achiev­ing a new life is not easy, but with enough de­ter­mi­na­tion and sup­port from the ones around us, we will be able to achieve it.”</p>
    <p>2 CHANGES</p>
    <p>Mr Tan Wil Khiam: “As former in­mates, we want a new life, but change does not come eas­ily. This song is about draw­ing in­spi­ra­tion from our loved ones and us­ing it to in­spire our­selves to change for the better.”</p>
    <p>3</p>
    <p>FLAG OF VIC­TORY</p>
    <p>Mr Mo­hamed Razif: “Life is like a bat­tle­field and the former in­mate is like a sol­dier trudg­ing on in the war, fight­ing to stick to the right way and bat­tling all neg­a­tive thoughts and in­flu­ences in life.</p>
    <p>“At the end of the bat­tle, the flag of vic­tory awaits those with de­ter­mi­na­tion and strength.”</p>
    <p>4 UNHIDE</p>
    <p>Mr Am Yu­soff: “When in­mates are re­leased, we may feel low self-es­teem and self-doubt, es­pe­cially when we face ob­sta­cles or neg­a­tive re­ac­tions from oth­ers.</p>
    <p>“This song is about re­leas­ing our in­ner pos­i­tiv­ity. We should not hide be­hind bar­ri­ers or stay in the dark­ness. Rather, we should come out into the open and be the light for our­selves.”</p>
