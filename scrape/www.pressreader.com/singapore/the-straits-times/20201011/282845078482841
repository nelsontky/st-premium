    <p>The Chi­nese ren­minbi is draw­ing at­ten­tion as a haven from volatil­ity af­ter its best quar­ter in 12 years. The on­shore ren­minbi gained 3.8 per cent in the three­month pe­riod end­ing Sept 30, the most since early 2008, while its off­shore coun­ter­part ad­vanced more than 4 per cent.</p>
    <p>That was more than Group of Ten (G-10) cur­ren­cies in­clud­ing tra­di­tional refuges like the Swiss franc and Ja­panese yen, a re­mark­able turn­around con­sid­er­ing that the ren­minbi’s de­val­u­a­tion just five years ago trig­gered a broad market rout.</p>
    <p>China’s suc­cess in fight­ing Covid-19 and its eco­nomic fall­out has at­tracted praise and in­vest­ment, and fu­elled spec­u­la­tion that the ren­minbi could be­come a new sanc­tu­ary for the risk-averse.</p>
    <p>The na­tion still tightly con­trols its ex­change rate ver­sus a bas­ket of cur­ren­cies, and de­ter­mines how much money is able to cross its bor­ders – a taboo for many in­ter­na­tional as­set man­agers – but those mea­sures have also sta­bilised the cur­rency even as price swings pick up else­where.</p>
    <p>The off­shore ren­minbi has been “less volatile through­out this time pe­riod and the liquidity in the cur­rency re­mains quite good rel­a­tive to many cur­ren­cies”, said Jef­feries global head of for­eign ex­change Brad Bech­tel.</p>
    <p>“China has done a lot of work on im­prov­ing their cap­i­tal mar­kets and ac­cess to those mar­kets and that is likely to con­tinue, which will im­prove liquidity and at­tract cap­i­tal flows.”</p>
    <p>Ear­lier this month, in­vestors sent the off­shore ren­minbi to its high­est since May last year, with the cur­rency ral­ly­ing as much as 0.8 per cent, the most in al­most three months. Over­seas hold­ings of Chi­nese sovereign debt have mean­while risen 22 per cent this year through Au­gust.</p>
    <p>China is set to be the only ma­jor econ­omy to grow this year.</p>
    <p>Econ­o­mists sur­veyed by Bloomberg ex­pect the na­tion’s gross do­mes­tic prod­uct to rise 2.1 per cent com­pared with a 4.4 per cent es­ti­mated drop in the United States, where dis­agree­ment around fur­ther stim­u­lus, fears of a virus resur­gence and elec­tion risk are damp­ing ex­pec­ta­tions.</p>
    <p>The ren­minbi now of­ten trades as much per day as the franc or ster­ling, Mr Bech­tel said.</p>
    <p>Trad­ing in the cur­rency grew 41 per cent be­tween 2016 and last year, with a snap­shot of turnover taken by the Bank for In­ter­na­tional Set­tle­ments in April last year show­ing that an av­er­age US$285 bil­lion (S$387 bil­lion) a day changed hands, just be­hind vol­umes in the Swiss cur­rency.</p>
    <p>It is hav­ing a greater im­pact on the rest of the for­eign ex­change market, with cor­re­la­tion be­tween the off­shore ren­minbi and cur­ren­cies in­clud­ing the pound and Aus­tralian dol­lar strength­en­ing since the start of the pan­demic, ac­cord­ing to HSBC Hold­ings.</p>
    <p>But bar­ri­ers re­main to the ren­minbi’s wider use. While global re­serves in the Chi­nese cur­rency have grown to 2.1 per cent, up from 1.4 per cent two years ago, the dol­lar re­mains dom­i­nant; more than 60 per cent of hold­ings are still de­nom­i­nated in the US cur­rency, ac­cord­ing to the In­ter­na­tional Mone­tary Fund.</p>
    <p>The ren­minbi also car­ries more risks than its G-10 coun­ter­parts. Not only does China’s man­aged ex­change rate make for pol­icy sur­prises, in­vestors must also stay savvy to global trade ten­sions.</p>
    <p>“Re­cent Chi­nese out­put data has been reassuring, but this can be linked with state sup­port and pent-up de­mand from abroad,” said Rabobank head of for­eign ex­change strat­egy Jane Fo­ley.</p>
    <p>“Look­ing ahead, US-China ten­sions and trends towards on­shoring make us very cau­tious.”</p>
    <p>China’s suc­cess in fight­ing Covid-19 and its eco­nomic fall­out has at­tracted praise and in­vest­ment, and fu­elled spec­u­la­tion that the ren­minbi could be­come a new sanc­tu­ary for the risk-averse.</p>
