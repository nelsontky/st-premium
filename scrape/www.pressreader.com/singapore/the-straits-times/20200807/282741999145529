    <p>LON­DON • Eleven years af­ter the sud­den death of ac­tress Natasha Richard­son, her hus­band Liam Nee­son and their son Micheal Richard­son have found re­newed heal­ing in their first film to­gether, Made In Italy.</p>
    <p>“Read­ing the script was like, what? This is so weird,” said Micheal, 25. “Like, surely Mum has a hand at, like, why this is hap­pen­ing right now.”</p>
    <p>The film, out on de­mand on var­i­ous broad­cast plat­forms to­day, cen­tres around a fa­ther and his es­tranged son who at­tempt to ren­o­vate a Tus­can home in­her­ited from his late wife.</p>
    <p>Natasha Richard­son, the star of movies like The Par­ent Trap (1998) and Wak­ing Up In Reno (2002), died at age 45 af­ter suf­fer­ing a se­vere brain in­jury in a ski­ing ac­ci­dent in Canada in 2009.</p>
    <p>Ac­tor James D’Arcy wrote the script be­fore she died and it was with a lot of trep­i­da­tion when he sent it to Nee­son, who is fa­mous for star­ring in the ac­tion film se­ries Taken (2008 to 2014).</p>
    <p>“I thought we could get a pretty in­sult­ing note back say­ing, ‘how dare you send him a script like that?’” said D’Arcy, who is mak­ing his di­rec­to­rial de­but. “And ac­tu­ally, it was com­pletely the op­po­site. He re­ally re­sponded to it per­son­ally.”</p>
    <p>Nee­son, 68, sug­gested his re­al­life son be cast in the film, but wanted to make sure Micheal was pro­tected.</p>
    <p>“He’s a pretty young man and he had a ter­ri­ble trauma 10 years ago,” Nee­son said. “And I did not want him to be re-trau­ma­tised in the mak­ing of the film.”</p>
    <p>The movie is filled with ro­mance, com­edy and a mes­sage of hope – which Nee­son hopes helps peo­ple dur­ing the stress­ful time of the coro­n­avirus pandemic.</p>
    <p>“It’s im­por­tant to say that we have each other. We have to help each other,” he said.</p>
