    <p>DO­MES­TIC HELPERS</p>
    <p>One in five Sin­ga­pore house­holds has a do­mes­tic helper.</p>
    <p>As our pop­u­la­tion greys, that fig­ure is ex­pected to grow as more helpers have to be em­ployed to look af­ter the aged.</p>
    <p>But in the year of the pan­demic, bring­ing in helpers from tra­di­tional sources, such as the Philip­pines, In­dia, In­done­sia and Myanmar, has be­come more com­plex and ex­pen­sive.</p>
    <p>If you need a helper now, get in line. A re­cent report by The Straits Times stated that for ev­ery avail­able trans­fer helper (a helper mov­ing from one lo­cal em­ployer to an­other), there are 20 em­ploy­ers wait­ing to snap her up.</p>
    <p>So for per­haps the first time ever, helpers have power.</p>
    <p>The best mea­sure of this is in dol­lars. Salaries for trans­fer helpers have risen, as have fees charged by em­ploy­ment agen­cies.</p>
    <p>An ex­pe­ri­enced helper from the</p>
    <p>Philip­pines can com­mand a salary of up to $900, up from about $700 pre­vi­ously.</p>
    <p>But that money will be hard­earned. With more adults stay­ing in­doors be­cause of work-fromhome poli­cies, she will have more to do. This means more stress and shorter tem­pers.</p>
    <p>A spokesman for Hu­man­i­tar­ian Or­gan­i­sa­tion for Mi­gra­tion Economics, a char­ity that sup­ports mi­grant work­ers, said: “Mi­grant do­mes­tic work­ers (MDW) have</p>
    <p>been af­fected by Covid-19 mea­sures, re­sult­ing in over­work­ing due to the house­hold stay­ing at home for longer hours, en­hanced iso­la­tion and no rest days.</p>
    <p>“Em­ploy­ers can up­hold their fam­ily’s do­mes­tic worker rights by hav­ing a clear communicat­ion chan­nel with them and guar­an­tee­ing their weekly rest days.</p>
    <p>“Many MDWs are afraid to speak up for fear of per­se­cu­tion, so es­tab­lish­ing a safe communicat­ion</p>
    <p>chan­nel be­tween em­ployer and do­mes­tic worker is important for their well-be­ing.”</p>
    <p>In other words, if your do­mes­tic helper has not ex­er­cised her walk­a­way power for more money or better con­di­tions this year, count your­self lucky.</p>
    <p>If she has left for an­other em­ployer, maybe look at how you treat the next one – that is, if you can find one.</p>
