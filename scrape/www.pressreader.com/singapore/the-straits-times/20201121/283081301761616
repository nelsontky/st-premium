    <p>Ru­pert Grint has beaten the record for the fastest time to reach one mil­lion fol­low­ers on In­sta­gram.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to the Guin­ness World Records, the Harry Pot­ter ac­tor man­aged the feat in just four hours and one minute af­ter he joined the site last Tues­day.</p>
    <p>The pre­vi­ous record was set by Sir David At­ten­bor­ough, who had taken 43 min­utes l onger. The Bri­tish broad­caster and nat­u­ral­ist hit one mil­lion fol­low­ers in four hours and 44 min­utes with his first post in Septem­ber.</p>
    <p>Be­fore that, it was Amer­i­can ac­tress Jen­nifer Anis­ton, who had caused a melt­down on the so­cial net­work­ing site when she joined last Oc­to­ber. She had posted a selfie with the other five cast mem­bers of the sit­com Friends (1994 to 2004) – Lisa Kudrow, Courteney Cox, Matt LeBlanc, David Sch­wim­mer and Matthew Perry.</p>
    <p>She took five hours and six­teen min­utes to reach seven fig­ures.</p>
    <p>Grint’s first post was a selfie with his six-month-old baby girl, Wed­nes­day.</p>
    <p>The 32-year-old English ac­tor wrote: “Hey In­sta­gram.... only 10 years late, but here I am. Grint on the Gram. Here to in­tro­duce you all to Wed­nes­day G. Grint. Stay safe, Ru­pert.”</p>
    <p>Harry Pot­ter co-star Tom Fel­ton, who played Draco Mal­foy in the fan­tasy fran­chise, was among the first to re­ply: “Wel­come Weasley, it’s about time. Love to Wed­nes­day.”</p>
    <p>Af­ter less than 24 hours on the so­cial net­work­ing site, Grint had more than 2 mil­lion fol­low­ers, in­clud­ing singer Ari­ana Grande and At­ten­bor­ough.</p>
    <p>Although there have been only three posts from him so far, he has al­ready amassed more than 3.4 mil­lion fol­low­ers and fol­lows a mix of per­son­al­i­ties – from en­vi­ron­men­tal ac­tivist Greta Thun­berg to For­mula One cham­pion Lewis Hamil­ton.</p>
    <p>Grint and his long-time part­ner, ac­tress Ge­or­gia Groome, an­nounced the birth of their first child in May.</p>
    <p>The pair met on the set of the com­edy An­gus, Thongs And Per­fect Snog­ging in 2008 and be­came a cou­ple in 2011.</p>
