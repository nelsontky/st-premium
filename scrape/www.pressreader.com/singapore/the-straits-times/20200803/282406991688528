    <p>AGE: 31</p>
    <p>HEIGHT: 1.68m</p>
    <p>WEIGHT: 65kg</p>
    <p>Mr Quek played com­pet­i­tive rugby for more than 20 years – through­out pri­mary and sec­ondary school days, in ju­nior col­lege and also at Sin­ga­pore Man­age­ment Univer­sity.</p>
    <p>Play­ing a sport he loved taught him many lessons, he said. “There will be times dur­ing the game where you get hit so hard and it feels al­most im­pos­si­ble to get up and keep play­ing. But once you find it in you to get back up, some of th­ese mo­ments also re­sult in the most re­ward­ing ex­pe­ri­ences,” said Mr Quek, who has a de­gree in busi­ness man­age­ment.</p>
    <p>Even though he was also ac­tive in other recre­ational sports such as foot­ball on the week­ends, his health be­gan to suf­fer in 2015.</p>
    <p>“It was caused pri­mar­ily by a self-in­dul­gent life­style of an un­healthy diet and fre­quent­ing the bars and clubs.</p>
    <p>“Grow­ing up, health and fit­ness was not a pri­or­ity for me as I re­lied on my young age and in­volve­ment in sports to get by,” said Mr Quek, who works in the fi­nance sec­tor.</p>
    <p>He said “this over-con­fi­dence in youth­ful­ness and sport­ing ac­tiv­ity” even­tu­ally caused his body to suc­cumb to health is­sues such as Me­niere’s dis­ease – a dis­or­der of the in­ner ear that can lead to dizzy spells and hear­ing loss – and chronic gas­tri­tis.</p>
    <p>“It be­came se­ri­ous enough for me to re-ex­am­ine the life­style I was lead­ing,” said Mr Quek, who is en­gaged to a di­eti­tian, Ms Olivia Wong, 31.</p>
    <p>Three years ago, he de­cided to join a gym, F45 Novena, with his friends.He par­tic­i­pated in two sep­a­rate eight-week chal­lenges that re­quired him to ad­here to a strict diet, ex­er­cise sched­ule and sleep pat­terns.</p>
    <p>He was de­ter­mined to work on his health and ul­ti­mately won both chal­lenges among mem­bers in the stu­dio.</p>
    <p>His health has since im­proved. “I don’t ex­pe­ri­ence any symp­toms from chronic gas­tri­tis now be­cause I’ve been more watchful of what I con­sume and I also limit my al­co­hol con­sump­tion, which was a big con­trib­u­tor to gas­tri­tis.”</p>
    <p>Cur­rently, he does not go to the gym and in­stead fo­cuses on cal­is­then­ics dur­ing his work­outs six times a week, us­ing pull-up bars, par­al­lel dip bars or gym­nas­tic rings at home or at neigh­bour­hood parks.</p>
    <p>“What started out as an in­ten­tion to fix my health even­tu­ally turned into a habit and life­style for me to en­joy and also to ap­pre­ci­ate small wins along the way,” he said.</p>
