    <p>• Mod­ern Fam­ily star Sofia Ver­gara (right) has topped the Forbes list of the high­est-paid ac­tresses in the world, lead­ing a charge by small-screen tal­ent in a year when movie the­atres have gone dark, the mag­a­zine said last Fri­day.</p>
    <p>Ver­gara – who is also now a judge on Amer­ica’s Got Tal­ent – earned a whop­ping US$43 mil­lion (S$59 mil­lion) in the past 12 months in salary and en­dorse­ments. She moved up from sec­ond place last year.</p>
    <p>The 48-yearold Colom­bi­aborn ac­tress earned US$500,000 an episode for the fi­nal sea­son of Emmy-win­ning Mod­ern Fam­ily (2009 to this year), which wrapped up in April.</p>
    <p>Forbes es­ti­mated she would earn “at least US$10 mil­lion each sea­son” for Amer­ica’s Got Tal­ent, one of the most pop­u­lar re­al­ity com­pe­ti­tion shows in the United States.</p>
    <p>The coro­n­avirus pan­demic paral­ysed Hol­ly­wood, forc­ing crews to stop pro­duc­tion and shut­ter­ing movie the­atres, so many big-bud­get films have been de­layed.</p>
    <p>Many film stars also make money by earn­ing a share of the prof­its – mean­ing if movies are not re­leased in cin­e­mas, their in­come plum­mets.</p>
    <p>Nev­er­the­less, Os­car win­ner An­gelina Jolie was in sec­ond place on the Forbes list at US$35 mil­lion.</p>
    <p>But ac­tresses who make most of their money from tele­vi­sion and/or stream­ing ser­vices made up the bulk of the list.</p>
    <p>Won­der Woman (2017) star Gal Gadot came in third at US$31 mil­lion, but she made a chunk of her money from the Net­flix film Red No­tice. Grey’s Anatomy (2005 to present) lead Ellen Pom­peo was eighth at US$19 mil­lion, and The Hand­maid’s Tale (2017 to present) star Elis­a­beth Moss came in ninth at US$16 mil­lion.</p>
    <p>An­other Os­car win­ner, Vi­ola Davis, made her first ap­pear­ance on the top 10 list.</p>
    <p>The How To Get Away With Mur­der (2014 to this year) ac­tress – who will soon star in Net­flix’s adap­ta­tion of playwright Au­gust Wil­son’s play Ma Rainey’s Black Bot­tom – came in 10th at US$15.5 mil­lion.</p>
    <p>Even the ven­er­a­ble Meryl Streep (fifth place) made most of her in­come in the past year from ei­ther films for stream­ing ser­vices or tele­vi­sion roles.</p>
    <p>In to­tal, the top 10 high­est-paid ac­tresses in the world this year earned US$254 mil­lion in the 12 months lead­ing up to June, Forbes said. That was down 20 per cent from last year.</p>
    <p>The top 10 high­est-paid ac­tors made al­most US$550 mil­lion in the same pe­riod. Dwayne “The Rock” John­son topped the list for the men at US$87.5 mil­lion.</p>
