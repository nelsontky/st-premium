    <p>• The Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion yes­ter­day an­nounced new sanc­tions against Iran’s de­fence min­istry and oth­ers in­volved in the coun­try’s nu­clear and weapons pro­gramme to sup­port US as­ser­tion that all UN sanc­tions against Te­heran are now re­stored, a move key al­lies such as the Euro­peans dis­pute.</p>
    <p>US Sec­re­tary of State Mike Pom­peo, flanked by other top mem­bers of Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump’s na­tional se­cu­rity team, also told re­porters that Washington had im­posed new sanc­tions on Venezue­lan Pres­i­dent Ni­co­las Maduro, who has forged closer ties be­tween Cara­cas and Te­heran.</p>
    <p>“For nearly two years, cor­rupt of­fi­cials in Te­heran have worked with the il­le­git­i­mate regime in Venezuela to flout the UN arms em­bargo,” Mr Pom­peo said. “Our ac­tions to­day are a warning that should be heard world­wide.”</p>
    <p>Mr Pom­peo said that Mr Trump has i ssued an ex­ec­u­tive or­der “that is a new and pow­er­ful tool to en­force the UN arms em­bargo”.</p>
    <p>He did not of­fer de­tails on what the US sanc­tions were.</p>
    <p>Trea­sury Sec­re­tary Steven Mnuchin, who ap­peared with Mr Pom­peo, also an­nounced sep­a­rate sanc­tions on the Atomic En­ergy Or­gan­i­sa­tion of Iran.</p>
    <p>The US has trig­gered a “snap back”, or re­sump­tion, of vir­tu­ally all UN sanc­tions on Iran, in­clud­ing the arms em­bargo, to come into ef­fect at 8pm on Satur­day.</p>
    <p>A ma­jor part of Washington’s new push is an ex­ec­u­tive or­der tar­get­ing those who buy or sell Iran con­ven­tional arms.</p>
    <p>Un­der the 2015 nu­clear deal, which the United States had uni­lat­er­ally pulled out of in 2018, the UN con­ven­tional arms em­bargo is set to ex­pire on Oct 18.</p>
    <p>Other par­ties to the nu­clear deal and most United Na­tions Se­cu­rity Coun­cil mem­bers have said they do not be­lieve the US has the right to reim­pose the UN sanc­tions and that Washington’s move has no le­gal ef­fect.</p>
    <p>Last Fri­day, Britain, France and Ger­many told the Se­cu­rity Coun­cil that UN sanc­tions re­lief for Iran – agreed un­der the 2015 nu­clear deal – would con­tinue beyond Sun­day, de­spite the US’ as­ser­tion.</p>
    <p>Sep­a­rately, 56 for­mer prime min­is­ters, pres­i­dents, foreign min­is­ters and de­fence min­is­ters from 20 North At­lantic Treaty Or­gan­i­sa­tion (Nato) coun­tries, plus Ja­pan and South Korea, have re­leased an open let­ter im­plor­ing their cur­rent lead­ers to join the Treaty on the Pro­hi­bi­tion of Nu­clear Weapons – the pact ne­go­ti­ated in 2017 that is now just six rat­i­fi­ca­tions shy of the 50 needed to take ef­fect.</p>
    <p>The let­ter, re­leased on Sun­day on the eve of the UN’s 75th an­niver­sary commemorat­ion at the an­nual Gen­eral Assembly, as­serted that the risks of nu­cle­ar­weapons use have es­ca­lated in re­cent years “whether by ac­ci­dent, mis­cal­cu­la­tion or de­sign”.</p>
    <p>Point­ing to the coro­n­avirus pan­demic – which UN of­fi­cials have called the great­est chal­lenge in the or­gan­i­sa­tion’s his­tory – the let­ter writ­ers said: “We must not sleep­walk into a cri­sis of even greater pro­por­tions than the one we have ex­pe­ri­enced this year.”</p>
    <p>The sign­ers in­cluded for­mer prime min­is­ters of Canada, Ja­pan, Italy and Poland.</p>
    <p>The let­ter’s re­lease was co­or­di­nated by the In­ter­na­tional Cam­paign to Abol­ish Nu­clear Weapons, a Geneva-based group that won the 2017 No­bel Peace Prize for its role in ne­go­ti­a­tions that led to the treaty.</p>
