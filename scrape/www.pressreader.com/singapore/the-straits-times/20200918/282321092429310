    <p>Pub­lic re­la­tions spe­cial­ist Kr­isha Ramos took leave on Wed­nes­day to go to the Top­shop store at VivoCity.</p>
    <p>It was the sec­ond last day be­fore the store shut for good, mark­ing the Bri­tish fash­ion re­tailer’s phys­i­cal exit from Sin­ga­pore af­ter two decades.</p>
    <p>Be­sides want­ing to snap up deals at the clos­ing sale, it was also a trip down mem­ory lane for Ms Ramos.</p>
    <p>The 26-year-old had her first job there – for a year af­ter her O lev­els – and bought her first prom dress from the Tampines 1 out­let.</p>
    <p>“I rem­i­nisced with a few friends on how big and im­por­tant Top­shop was back when we were 16. It meant more to me than just a fash­ion brand – it was my first job ex­pe­ri­ence and it was cool to work at Top­shop then,” she says.</p>
    <p>“Many of us part-timers were around the same age or wait­ing for (the next phase of) school. Even if we were on the morn­ing shift, we’d ex­tend shifts to wait for the rest to hang out. I was sad to hear they were clos­ing be­cause it’s like the end of an era.”</p>
    <p>Ear­lier this week, Wing Tai Re­tail, which man­ages Top­shop and Top­man in Sin­ga­pore, an­nounced the clo­sure of the last out­let at VivoCity, and that its fo­cus for the two brands will be on­line.</p>
    <p>The brands are avail­able on­line via the Top­shop web­site (sg.top­shop.com) and lo­cal e-tailer Zalora.</p>
    <p>De­spite its dwin­dling pop­u­lar­ity here these days, Top­shop, which sells women’s cloth­ing, shoes, make-up and ac­ces­sories, was once a cov­eted brand that dom­i­nated the global high-street fash­ion scene.</p>
    <p>It be­gan in the United King­dom in the 1960s as a brand ex­ten­sion of Bri­tish depart­ment store Peter Robin­son, be­fore putting down roots as an in­de­pen­dent re­tail chain called Top Shop in 1973.</p>
    <p>Top­man was launched as a brother brand in 1978, to com­pete in the menswear mar­ket.</p>
    <p>By the early 2000s, the re­branded Top­shop was a front run­ner in re­leas­ing celebrity and de­signer col­lab­o­ra­tions, with cap­sule col­lec­tions de­signed by names such as Ger­man knitwear de­signer Markus Lupfer.</p>
    <p>More will re­mem­ber its main­stream tie-ups – such as with Bri­tish su­per­model Kate Moss in 2007; and pop star Bey­once’s hotly an­tic­i­pated ath­leisure brand Ivy Park in 2015 – a nod to her daugh­ter, Blue Ivy. Bey­once later bought Top­shop’s 50 per cent share to fully own Ivy Park.</p>
    <p>In Sin­ga­pore, the first Top­shop store opened at Wisma Atria in 2000. At its peak, Top­shop was in around eight lo­ca­tions, in­clud­ing depart­ment stores.</p>
    <p>The Knights­bridge flag­ship store, opened in De­cem­ber 2010, was the brand’s largest in Asia.</p>
    <p>The flag­ship boasted phonecharg­ing sta­tions and a be­spoke per­sonal shop­ping ser­vice – a first in Sin­ga­pore at the time. Ap­point­ments were com­pli­men­tary and tai­lor-made to the cus­tomer’s style.</p>
    <p>In 2015, it was re­ported that the brand was mov­ing out of Knights­bridge, along­side other ten­ants in­clud­ing Brooks Broth­ers, to make way for Sin­ga­pore’s first Ap­ple Store, which opened there in 2017.</p>
    <p>For many peo­ple born here in the 1980s and 1990s – the clo­sure of Top­shop and Top­man marks the end of an era in fash­ion.</p>
    <p>Shop­pers were sur­prised to hear the news and, like Ms Ramos, they had only fond mem­o­ries.</p>
    <p>Mr Toh Weim­ing, 32, re­mem­bers buy­ing his first set of of­fice at­tire from Top­man in 2007.</p>
    <p>“The styles were a lot nicer and younger com­pared with other brands, and Uniqlo and H&M didn’t ex­ist in Sin­ga­pore then,” says the se­nior pub­lic re­la­tions as­so­ciate.</p>
    <p>“But I think it has been years since I last shopped at Top­man due to cheaper al­ter­na­tives else­where that of­fered the same styles.”</p>
    <p>He adds that he is un­likely to buy the brand’s clothes on­line: “I pre­fer to try on the clothes be­fore I pur­chase them.”</p>
    <p>Ms Ramos, who snagged an $89.90 dress for $20 at the clos­ing sale, says she will con­tinue to pur­chase the brand’s prod­ucts on­line. “I think what Top­shop is re­ally good at is state­ment pieces that go be­yond a cou­ple of wears,” she adds.</p>
    <p>Many shop­pers praised Top­shop’s pe­tite range and Top­man’s slim­mer tai­lor­ing, which they found suit­able for Asian physiques.</p>
    <p>Pub­lic ser­vant Tan Chin Hong, 28, who has been wear­ing Top­man since his ju­nior col­lege days, says: “Small-sized guys like me can find clothes there. They’re of good qual­ity and are long-last­ing.”</p>
    <p>Echo­ing his sen­ti­ment, so­cial me­dia man­ager Eu­nice Heng says Top­shop is “still one of the first few brands I will turn to for the pe­tite line”. “I adored the Knights­bridge out­let; I was there al­most ev­ery week­end at one time. Not nec­es­sar­ily to buy. Just brows­ing in the store brought me joy,” adds the 26-yearold, who last pur­chased from Top­shop via Zalora dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker.</p>
    <p>For fash­ion show pro­ducer and stylist Daniel Boey, Top­shop is “ahead of its time with the use of dig­i­tal medi­ums in its shows” and how it en­gaged au­di­ences.</p>
    <p>“I thought it was ground­break­ing for its time. I re­mem­ber fre­quent­ing its store at Ox­ford Cir­cus when I was work­ing in Lon­don and was thrilled when Top­shop made its ap­pear­ance in Sin­ga­pore, way be­fore all the other high-street brands,” says Boey, 55.</p>
    <p>“I have fond mem­o­ries shop­ping there. It’ll be missed.”</p>

    <p>SO­CIAL ME­DIA MAN­AGER EU­NICE HENG, 26, who is a big fan of Top­shop’s pe­tite line</p>
