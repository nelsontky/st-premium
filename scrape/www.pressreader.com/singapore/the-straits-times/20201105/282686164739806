    <p>In a time when movies about women gifted with oth­er­worldly tal­ents tend to be cel­e­bra­tions of fem­i­nine power, The Witches feels like a throw­back.</p>
    <p>From Dis­ney’s Malef­i­cent (2014) and Frozen (2013) to Stu­dio Ghi­bli an­i­mated fea­tures like Kiki’s De­liv­ery Ser­vice (1989), to­day’s shows about fe­male spell­cast­ers or heal­ers veer to­wards up­dat­ing and re­vis­ing tra­di­tional Euro­pean fairy tales, many of which de­monise women for the crime of liv­ing alone and lik­ing it.</p>
    <p>The Witches, a com­edy-tinged fan­tasy, opens in cin­ema to­day.</p>
    <p>It is an adap­ta­tion of the 1983 Roald Dahl novel of the same name, a book banned by some li­braries be­cause it has been said that the text car­ries a mes­sage of mis­trust and para­noia to­wards women.</p>
    <p>Ac­tress Oc­tavia Spencer, who stars in the movie, rub­bishes the idea that the movie, which comes after a 1990 adap­ta­tion star­ring An­jel­ica Hus­ton, con­tains misog­yny.</p>
    <p>“Yes, the mag­i­cal women who have that power – witches – are women. But for me, it’s never hat­ing women, it’s about hat­ing the power of evil,” she says.</p>
    <p>The story, set mostly in the late 1960s and 1970s, stars Anne Hath­away as the Grand High Witch, leader of the world’s witches. She pre­sides over a con­fer­ence to un­veil a potion that she hopes will turn the world’s chil­dren into mice. The witch-hat­ing Grandma (played by Spencer) and the or­phan Hero Boy (played by Jahzir Bruno as a child and voiced by Chris Rock as an adult) hap­pen to be stay­ing at the same ho­tel.</p>
    <p>Spencer, 50, was speak­ing to jour­nal­ists from around the world at a vir­tual press con­fer­ence re­cently.</p>
    <p>She says that there is a “de­li­ciously evil world” un­fold­ing on screen. To con­fuse fan­tasy with real-world gen­der pol­i­tics would be to “draw the wrong par­al­lel”, adds Spencer, win­ner of the Best Sup­port­ing Ac­tress Os­car for her role in the civil rights drama The Help (2012). She was also nom­i­nated for the same award for her work in the sci­ence-fic­tion fan­tasy The Shape Of Wa­ter (2017), win­ner of the Os­car for Best Pic­ture.</p>
    <p>Be­cause of pan­demic pre­cau­tions caus­ing cin­ema clo­sures in the United States, the film was pulled from the­atri­cal re­lease there and moved to the HBO Max on-de­mand stream­ing ser­vice, where it was re­leased on Oct 22.</p>
    <p>In Sin­ga­pore and other coun­tries which have emerged from strict so­cial dis­tanc­ing mea­sures, it will be re­leased in cin­e­mas.</p>
    <p>“I’ll never not want to go to the movies. But right now, we have to keep peo­ple safe. I’m grate­ful they found a way to re­lease it,” she says. “In Amer­ica, we haven’t re­ally mit­i­gated the virus that well, but in other coun­tries, peo­ple are get­ting to en­joy films in the theatre and I’m quite jeal­ous.”</p>
    <p>The Witches has a writ­ing team which com­prises Robert Ze­meckis (who also di­rects the film), Kenya Bar­ris (the African Amer­i­can-cen­tred com­edy se­ries Black-ish, 2014 to present) and Guillermo del Toro, who di­rected Spencer in The Shape Of Wa­ter.</p>
    <p>Spencer says she loves how the writ­ers made Grandma and Hero Boy black and South­ern. In the book, both char­ac­ters are white, with the grand­mother be­ing Nor­we­gian and the boy, Bri­tish.</p>
    <p>“There’s a dif­fer­ent feel­ing to peo­ple who are from the South. To cre­ate this char­ac­ter, I thought about my grandma and the older women I en­coun­tered as a kid,” she says.</p>
    <p>Like many women of that gen­er­a­tion, that gra­cious­ness cov­ered a spine of steel. The Grandma char­ac­ter makes her grand­son carry the travel suit­cases, for ex­am­ple.</p>
    <p>“She’s fun, but she’s also a toughlove grand­mother be­cause she knows her grand­son will have to learn how to stand on his own to be­come a man.”</p>
    <p>The Witches opens in cin­e­mas to­day.</p>
