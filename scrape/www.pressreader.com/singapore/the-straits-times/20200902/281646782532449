    <p>One health­care multi­na­tional the Min­istry of Man­power (MOM) pe­nalised this year re­jected lo­cal job ap­pli­cants for not meet­ing re­quire­ments that were not even stated in the job ad­ver­tise­ment.</p>
    <p>A probe found that it did not short­list or in­ter­view any of the seven lo­cal can­di­dates who met the job re­quire­ments, and deemed two can­di­dates “overqual­i­fied”.</p>
    <p>The penalty: It will not be able to hire Em­ploy­ment Pass (EP) hold­ers or re­new ex­ist­ing ones for a year, said Man­power Min­is­ter Josephine Teo.</p>
    <p>“To stay in busi­ness, they will have to re­cruit more lo­cals, some­thing they should have done all along,” she added.</p>
    <p>Speak­ing in Par­lia­ment yes­ter­day, Mrs Teo said dis­crim­i­na­tion against qual­i­fied lo­cal pro­fes­sion­als, man­agers, ex­ec­u­tives and tech­ni­cians (PMETs) will be taken into ac­count by MOM when it eval­u­ates EP and S Pass ap­pli­ca­tions.</p>
    <p>Of all pos­si­ble in­fringe­ments, this of­fends Sin­ga­pore­ans the most – that they are qual­i­fied but lose out to a for­eign can­di­date who does not ap­pear to be bet­ter, she added.</p>
    <p>Mrs Teo also re­sponded to calls to re­veal the names of firms on the Fair Con­sid­er­a­tion Frame­work watch­list, made up of about 1,200 firms that MOM is scru­ti­n­is­ing for po­ten­tially dis­crim­i­na­tory hir­ing prac­tices.</p>
    <p>Such an ap­proach, she said, would be counter-pro­duc­tive. The firms on the list have not flouted the rules but have an un­usu­ally high share of for­eign PMETs com­pared with the rest of the in­dus­try, she added.</p>
    <p>Un­til they im­prove, their work-pass ap­pli­ca­tions will be re­jected or held back, while the Tri­par­tite Al­liance for Fair and Pro­gres­sive Em­ploy­ment Prac­tices helps them hire more lo­cals, Mrs Teo said.</p>
    <p>Some firms im­prove. For in­stance, one firm’s lo­cal of­fice sought spe­cial ap­proval from its over­seas head­quar­ters to ex­pand the re­cruit­ment cri­te­ria to take into ac­count lo­cal con­di­tions, she said.</p>
    <p>An­other firm, which deals with high net-worth clients from a par­tic­u­lar coun­try – with lan­guage and cul­tural pref­er­ences – agreed that roles that did not re­quire deal­ing di­rectly with clients could be filled by lo­cals.</p>
    <p>Mrs Teo said: “If we had vil­i­fied these firms in­stead through a name-and-shame ap­proach, we would have frus­trated their ef­forts to ex­pand lo­cal hir­ing. This is ul­ti­mately counter-pro­duc­tive.</p>
    <p>“Our al­ter­na­tive ap­proach of scru­ti­n­is­ing and en­gag­ing em­ploy­ers is highly re­source-in­ten­sive but, in fact, a more ef­fec­tive way to get busi­nesses to re­shape their HR prac­tices.”</p>
    <p>When eval­u­at­ing EP and S Pass ap­pli­ca­tions, MOM will also place ad­di­tional em­pha­sis on whether the firm has sup­ported its lo­cal PMET staff, as part of ef­forts to en­sure fair hir­ing. Mrs Teo called the move a “tilt in sup­port of lo­cal PMETs that goes be­yond fair con­sid­er­a­tion”.</p>
    <p>It will also con­sider whether the firm has re­sponded to govern­ment agen­cies’ ef­forts to help it re­cruit and train lo­cal PMETs.</p>
    <p>Mrs Teo said MOM takes all feed­back from whis­tle-blow­ers se­ri­ously, and called on em­ploy­ers to com­mit to fair-hir­ing prac­tices and re­spon­si­ble re­trench­ment.</p>
    <p>She said: “No amount of en­force­ment re­sources will catch enough em­ploy­ers if they are de­ter­mined to hide.</p>
    <p>“What we lose then is not just a job op­por­tu­nity for a lo­cal, but the trust that the sys­tem is fair, that the odds were not stacked against peo­ple who are try­ing.”</p>
