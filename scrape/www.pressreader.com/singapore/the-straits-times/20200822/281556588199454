    <p>Malaysia is set for its first state-level elec­tion since Prime Min­is­ter Muhyid­din Yassin as­sumed power, af­ter the High Court yes­ter­day dis­missed a le­gal chal­lenge against the dis­so­lu­tion of the Sabah state as­sem­bly. The Elec­tion Com­mis­sion had ear­lier this week an­nounced that an elec­tion is sched­uled to take place on Sept 26.</p>
    <p>Malaysia’s High Court has dis­missed a le­gal chal­lenge against the dis­so­lu­tion of the Sabah state as­sem­bly, paving the way for a state elec­tion to take place as sched­uled at the end of next month.</p>
    <p>In a de­ci­sion yes­ter­day, the High Court in Kota Kin­a­balu did not grant leave for the state’s for­mer chief min­is­ter Musa Aman to chal­lenge the dis­so­lu­tion, which was con­sented to by the state’s Gov­er­nor Juhar Mahirud­din on July 30.</p>
    <p>Ju­di­cial Com­mis­sioner Leonard David Shim said that Tun Juhar has dis­cre­tionary pow­ers to dis­solve the state as­sem­bly and the de­ci­sion by the head of state is not jus­ti­cia­ble.</p>
    <p>Tan Sri Musa’s lawyer said that his client will ap­peal the de­ci­sion at the Court of Ap­peal.</p>
    <p>The Elec­tion Com­mis­sion had ear­lier this week an­nounced that an elec­tion is sched­uled to take place on Sept 26.</p>
    <p>Mr Musa and 32 other Sabah as­sem­bly­men had filed the suit af­ter his at­tempt at re­turn­ing as the state’s chief min­is­ter via de­fec­tions was thwarted by the gov­er­nor’s move to con­sent to a dis­so­lu­tion re­quested by in­cum­bent chief min­is­ter Shafie Ap­dal.</p>
    <p>Mr Musa had se­cured 13 de­fec­tions from Datuk Seri Shafie’s camp and was plan­ning to meet the gov­er­nor to demon­strate that he pos­sessed the ma­jor­ity in the as­sem­bly. How­ever, Mr Shafie re­quested a dis­so­lu­tion, say­ing the man­date should be re­turned to the vot­ers in the state.</p>
    <p>The at­tempted takeover in Sabah mir­rors moves in other parts of Malaysia that saw a long line of state ad­min­is­tra­tions fall­ing to Malaysia’s rul­ing coali­tion Perikatan Na­sional (PN) via de­fec­tions.</p>
    <p>Perak, Kedah, Jo­hor and Me­laka had all changed hands from</p>
    <p>Pakatan Hara­pan (PH) to PN thanks to de­fec­tions.</p>
    <p>The PN fed­eral govern­ment was formed through de­fec­tions as well, with the cross­over of close to 40 MPs that caused the col­lapse of the PH ad­min­is­tra­tion in late Fe­bru­ary.</p>
    <p>The po­lit­i­cal de­vel­op­ments in Sabah have prompted a con­ver­sa­tion in Malaysia about party-hop­ping and de­fec­tions of elected rep­re­sen­ta­tives, with sev­eral MPs form­ing a bi­par­ti­san cau­cus to dis­cuss ways to stymie party-hop­ping.</p>
    <p>Sabah has 73 state as­sem­bly seats up for grabs, and will see the first ma­jor po­lit­i­cal bat­tle be­tween PH par­ties and PN par­ties since the change of fed­eral govern­ment.</p>
    <p>The lead-up to the elec­tion has proven to be a tu­mul­tuous one for PN par­ties, with in­ter­nal con­flicts within Sabah Barisan Na­sional weak­en­ing BN’s de­ci­sion to let its state chap­ter chair­man Bung Mokhtar Radin lead the elec­tion cam­paign and also be al­lowed to de­cide on a chief min­is­ter can­di­date.</p>
