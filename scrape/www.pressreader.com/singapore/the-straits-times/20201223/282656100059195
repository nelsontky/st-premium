    <p>This has been a chal­leng­ing and un­pre­dictable year.</p>
    <p>The daily rou­tines of most peo­ple have changed dra­mat­i­cally and many are still grap­pling with the ef­fects of the weak econ­omy and un­cer­tainty over the fu­ture as the Covid-19 pan­demic drags on.</p>
    <p>Dr Annabelle Chow, prin­ci­pal clin­i­cal psy­chol­o­gist at Annabelle Psy­chol­ogy, shares six tips on how to take care of your men­tal health.</p>
    <p>1</p>
    <p>STAY AWARE</p>
    <p>Ac­knowl­edge the dif­fi­cul­ties that you are ex­pe­ri­enc­ing and know that it is nat­u­ral to feel dif­fer­ently dur­ing this chal­leng­ing time.</p>
    <p>2</p>
    <p>STAY CON­NECTED</p>
    <p>Con­nect with sources of sup­port such as fam­ily mem­bers, friends and col­leagues through vir­tual means like phone and video calls to let them know that you care.</p>
    <p>You can also take the chance to re­con­nect with peo­ple you have lost touch with and let them know that they mat­ter to you.</p>
    <p>3</p>
    <p>STAY HEALTHY</p>
    <p>Main­tain a healthy life­style such as ex­er­cis­ing reg­u­larly, eat­ing a bal­anced diet and get­ting enough rest.</p>
    <p>4</p>
    <p>STAY IN­FORMED</p>
    <p>Keep up with up­dates on the pan­demic through rep­utable sources of in­for­ma­tion to re­claim a sense of agency.</p>
    <p>Be mind­ful of the time spent on the news, such as lim­it­ing the fre­quency and du­ra­tion of time spent read­ing.</p>
    <p>5</p>
    <p>STAY GRATE­FUL</p>
    <p>List three things that you are grate­ful for ev­ery day de­spite the changes in your daily life, so as to pro­mote a pos­i­tive mood and well-be­ing.</p>
    <p>6</p>
    <p>STAY HOPE­FUL</p>
    <p>Note down the things that you look for­ward to do­ing af­ter this pe­riod to re­mind your­self that there is life be­yond the pan­demic.</p>
