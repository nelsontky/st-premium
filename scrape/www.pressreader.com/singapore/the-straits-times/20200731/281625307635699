    <p>Fares on the much an­tic­i­pated cross-bor­der Jo­hor Baru-Sin­ga­pore Rapid Tran­sit Sys­tem (RTS) Link will be af­ford­able as prices will be set with the low-in­come group and daily com­muters i n mind to make the pro­ject vi­able, said Malaysia’s Trans­port Min­is­ter Wee Ka Siong yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>He added that ticket prices will be the same on both sides of the Cause­way, fac­tor­ing in con­ver­sion rates.</p>
    <p>SMRT Cor­po­ra­tion and Prasarana Malaysia, joint ven­ture part­ners for the pro­ject, have al­ready set­tled on the fee struc­ture.</p>
    <p>Speak­ing to re­porters in Jo­hor Baru after a cer­e­mony at the Cause­way to mark the of­fi­cial re­sump­tion of the pro­ject, Dr Wee said: “What­ever we de­cide here, say X amount in Malaysia, Sin­ga­pore will charge the same in Sin­ga­pore cur­rency. It will not be costly as we need to con­sider the low-in­come group and daily com­muters to make this pro­ject vi­able.”</p>
    <p>The fares will be an­nounced be­fore op­er­a­tions be­gin, he added. The pro­ject is sched­uled for com­ple­tion in 2026.</p>
    <p>The 4km RTS Link will con­nect Wood­lands North MRT sta­tion on Sin­ga­pore’s Thom­son-East Coast Line (TEL) to Bukit Cha­gar, a planned el­e­vated ter­mi­nal in Jo­hor Baru.</p>
    <p>The cur­rent KTM shut­tle train ser­vice will cease op­er­a­tions within six months after the RTS Link be­comes op­er­a­tional.</p>
    <p>Both coun­tries had ac­knowl­edged a need to al­le­vi­ate traf­fic con­ges­tion at the Cause­way, which fa­cil­i­tates about 300,000 cross­ings daily.</p>
    <p>The RTS Link will con­tinue to fea­ture the co-lo­ca­tion of Cus­toms, im­mi­gra­tion and quar­an­tine (CIQ) fa­cil­i­ties, so that pas­sen­gers un­dergo CIQ clear­ance only once – at their point of de­par­ture.</p>
    <p>“If you’re a Sin­ga­porean com­muter, you will only need to get clear­ance in Wood­lands. For Malaysian com­muters, you will be cleared at Bukit Cha­gar,” Dr Wee said.</p>
    <p>The min­is­ter added that the jour­ney would take only five min­utes and, dur­ing peak hours, trains will be de­ployed at an in­ter­val of 3.6 min­utes.</p>
    <p>This would al­low up to 300,000 pas­sen­gers to be trans­ported per day as the RTS Link has a ca­pac­ity of 10,000 com­muters.</p>
    <p>It now costs $5 for an MRT ride from Wood­lands to Bukit Cha­gar via KTM, and RM5 (S$1.60) for a one-way trip to Wood­lands from Bukit Cha­gar.</p>
    <p>Dr Wee said: “This is a ded­i­cated rail­way sys­tem from Bukit Cha­gar so for the dis­tance of 4km, it is us­ing the (Malaysian) LRT sys­tem.”</p>
    <p>The ini­tial plan was for the cross-bor­der link to use the same trains and rail sys­tems as the TEL, for economies of scale.</p>
    <p>As a re­sult of the change, the RTS Link will not use the ex­ist­ing Mandai De­pot in Sin­ga­pore – run by TEL op­er­a­tor SMRT – for heavy main­te­nance of trains.</p>
    <p>In­stead, a new de­pot will be con­structed in Wadi Hana, Jo­hor Baru.</p>
    <p>Said Dr Wee: “We need a main­te­nance de­pot, we need to have a place we can do ser­vic­ing and main­te­nance, that’s why we choose Malaysia.”</p>
    <p>“It will also cre­ate 1,000 jobs for the lo­cals. The land ac­qui­si­tion process will con­tinue with the help of the state govern­ment and the de­pot will be jointly owned by Sin­ga­pore and Malaysia.”</p>
    <p>The RTS Link pro­ject was sus­pended from April 1 last year, at Malaysia’s re­quest, to al­low some time for the coun­try to re­view the pro­ject.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day’s cer­e­mony was wit­nessed by Prime Min­is­ter Lee Hsien Loong and his Malaysian coun­ter­part Muhyid­din Yassin, as Sin­ga­pore’s Trans­port Min­is­ter Ong Ye Kung and Dr Wee marked the re­sump­tion of the pro­ject.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore will be bear­ing 61 per cent of the RM10 bil­lion pro­ject cost, Dr Wee said.</p>
