    <p>Not all mi­grant work­ers cleared of Covid-19 will be able to re­turn to work im­me­di­ately.</p>
    <p>Na­tional De­vel­op­ment Min­is­ter Lawrence Wong said yes­ter­day that some projects re­quire staff from dif­fer­ent firms to work to­gether, but if some of those em­ploy­ees are not yet cleared, the en­tire op­er­a­tion can be held up.</p>
    <p>Em­ploy­ers and con­trac­tors will also have to ful­fil safety re­quire­ments be­fore staff can start work.</p>
    <p>Mr Wong, who co-chairs the Covid-19 task force, was re­spond­ing to a ques­tion at a vir­tual press con­fer­ence about how many for­eign work­ers are back on the job.</p>
    <p>He said that “eas­ily more than 80 per cent” of the mi­grant work­ers liv­ing in dor­mi­to­ries have been cleared so far, but there will be a time lag be­fore they re­sume work.</p>
    <p>He cited the ex­am­ple of a con­struc­tion project that of­ten volves mul­ti­ple con­trac­tors.</p>
    <p>“If the project is at a par­tic­u­lar stage of work and you need work­ers... with the skill sets... for that par­tic­u­lar stage of work, but the sub­con­trac­tor with the work­ers is not able to restart... then the en­tire project is stalled for the time be­ing.</p>
    <p>“And that is why you do see of­ten the work­ers may be cleared but they may not all be work­ing im­me­di­ately.”</p>
    <p>Mr Wong said agen­cies like the Build­ing and Con­struc­tion Au­thor­ity and the Eco­nomic De­vel­op­ment in</p>
    <p>Board are work­ing with firms that have not yet met safe man­age­ment mea­sures, in­clud­ing is­sues re­lated to work sites and ac­com­mo­da­tion.</p>
    <p>He told em­ploy­ers of for­eign work­ers: “Do not wait un­til mid­dle of Au­gust when all the work­ers are cleared.</p>
    <p>“Sub­mit all the re­quire­ments now so that you can get all of these work­ing in par­al­lel, and then when the work­ers are ready, you can im­me­di­ately have work re­sume as soon as pos­si­ble.”</p>
