    <p>Three new ex­hibits opened at the Asian Civil­i­sa­tions Mu­seum (ACM) yes­ter­day – with a per­sonal twist.</p>
    <p>Faith Beauty Love Hope – Our Sto­ries, Your ACM show­cases trea­sures from the ACM col­lec­tion, cher­ryp­icked not just by cu­ra­tors but other peo­ple work­ing be­hind the scenes, in­clud­ing tech­ni­cal staff and stu­dent vol­un­teers.</p>
    <p>Aptly enough, the cap­tions ac­com­pa­ny­ing the items nar­rate the per­sonal anec­dotes be­hind the choices.</p>
    <p>An­other story is told at thINK, an ex­hibit about Hong Kong-based Dr Yuan Shao Liang, who has lent items from his fam­ily col­lec­tion to ACM since the mu­seum opened at the for­mer Tao Nan School in 1997.</p>
    <p>Last but not least, Sin­ga­porean artist Dawn Ng shares her per­sonal take on mem­ory in an in­stal­la­tion ti­tled Per­fect Stranger.</p>
    <p>The work, com­pris­ing 60 blocks of pa­per in­scribed with text, grew out of a ques­tion-and-an­swer project with a stranger, Ze­havit Efrati, an Is­raeli psy­chol­o­gist liv­ing in Sin­ga­pore, in 2016.</p>
    <p>ACM’s di­rec­tor Ken­nie Ting, 42, says that the Faith Beauty Love Hope ex­hi­bi­tion was put to­gether be­cause the mu­seum’s planned block­buster, a col­lab­o­ra­tion with Bei­jing’s Palace Mu­seum cen­tred on Ming Em­peror Yon­gle, was can­celled due to the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>“Ob­vi­ously we have been col­lec­tively go­ing through quite a lot this year. But we felt we also need to ac­knowl­edge the fact that each and ev­ery one of us has gone through per­sonal chal­lenges.”</p>
    <p>Hence the ti­tle of the new show, which Mr Ting says res­onates deeply with him as val­ues which will sus­tain ev­ery­one through dif­fi­cult times.</p>
    <p>The show’s guid­ing prin­ci­ple, al­low­ing peo­ple in­volved in the mu­seum to have a hand in choos­ing items, ac­knowl­edges the mu­seum’s role in a broader con­text.</p>
    <p>Ms Kan Shuyi, 37, ACM’s cu­ra­tor of Chi­nese art, says cu­ra­tors are usu­ally the defin­ing voice of ex­hi­bi­tions, but “the mu­seum is a vil­lage in a larger com­mu­nity”.</p>
    <p>This show re­flects that com­mu­nity by in­clud­ing staff mem­bers such as se­nior man­ager of tech­ni­cal dis­play, ex­hi­bi­tions Ma­zlan Anuar, 62.</p>
    <p>His choice of an enam­elled cop­per dish was mo­ti­vated by its as­so­ci­a­tion with the late Madam Eng-Lee Seok Chee, whose fam­ily do­nated the item.</p>
    <p>The vet­eran mu­seum staff, who joined the Na­tional Mu­seum of Sin­ga­pore in 1982, worked with Madam Eng when she was a cu­ra­tor.</p>
    <p>He re­calls: “She was very soft-spo­ken. Thirty-seven years I’ve been work­ing in mu­se­ums and I am still prac­tis­ing what I learnt from her.”</p>
    <p>The col­lec­tor’s voice is high­lighted in thINK, orig­i­nally con­ceived as a com­pan­ion show to the scut­tled Ming dy­nasty show but now of­fer­ing a coun­ter­point to Faith Beauty Love Hope.</p>
    <p>Mr Bernard Tan, 42, guest cu­ra­tor of thINK, says: “We want to ask our au­di­ences what we col­lect, whether it’s tan­gi­ble or in­tan­gi­ble, whether it’s mem­o­ries or some­thing which mar­ries form and func­tion.”</p>
    <p>The deputy di­rec­tor of re­tail and mer­chan­dis­ing at the Na­tional Her­itage Board notes that some­times the tan­gi­ble and in­tan­gi­ble blur, as in the case of a set of stele rub­bings com­mis­sioned by Dr Yuan’s father.</p>
    <p>“This is the only re­main­ing archive of some of these cul­tural struc­tures that were de­stroyed dur­ing the Cul­tural Revo­lu­tion,” he says.</p>
    <p>Mem­o­ries are also cen­tral to Sin­ga­pore artist Dawn Ng’s in­stal­la­tion at the Shaw Foyer. The project be­gan when she was preg­nant with her daugh­ter Ava in 2016.</p>
    <p>“One thing that re­ally hit me was the finite­ness of time. Be­fore hav­ing chil­dren, you al­ways feel that time is in­fi­nite, and that you’re for­ever young. With her com­ing into my life, what struck me was that though I would see to her be­gin­ning, she would most likely and surely see to my end.”</p>
    <p>The three ex­hi­bi­tions of­fer over­lap­ping themes which Mr Ting hopes will end 2020 on an op­ti­mistic note. He says: “A mu­seum is noth­ing with­out peo­ple. We want vis­i­tors to come and take away some­thing, but also leave some­thing be­hind on the dig­i­tal wall.”</p>
    <p>The in­ter­ac­tive so­cial wall at the Faith ex­hi­bi­tion of­fers vis­i­tors a chance to pick their favourite ob­ject and post it for oth­ers to see.</p>
    <p>Ms Kan adds: “In a mu­seum, where there are ob­jects that are timeless and tran­scend geography and his­tor­i­cal bound­aries, it’s a re­minder that all things will pass.”</p>
