    <p>NEW YORK • As pub­lic health of­fi­cials look to au­tumn and win­ter, the spec­tre of a new surge of Covid-19 gives them chills.</p>
    <p>But there is a scenario they dread even more: a se­vere flu sea­son, re­sult­ing in a “twindemic”.</p>
    <p>Even a mild flu sea­son could stag­ger hos­pi­tals al­ready cop­ing with Covid-19 cases.</p>
    <p>And though of­fi­cials do not know yet what de­gree of sever­ity to an­tic­i­pate this year, they are wor­ried large num­bers of peo­ple could forgo flu shots, in­creas­ing the risk of wide­spread out­breaks.</p>
    <p>The con­cern about a twindemic is so great that of­fi­cials around the world are push­ing the flu shot even be­fore it be­comes avail­able in clin­ics and doc­tors’ of­fices.</p>
    <p>Dr Robert Red­field, di­rec­tor of the US Cen­tres for Dis­ease Con­trol and Preven­tion (CDC), has been talk­ing it up, urg­ing cor­po­rate lead­ers to fig­ure out ways to in­oc­u­late em­ploy­ees. The CDC usu­ally pur­chases 500,000 doses for unin­sured adults, but this year or­dered an ad­di­tional 9.3 mil­lion doses.</p>
    <p>Dr An­thony Fauci, di­rec­tor of the Na­tional In­sti­tute of Al­lergy and In­fec­tious Dis­eases, has been im­plor­ing peo­ple to get the flu shot “so that you could at least blunt the ef­fect of one of those two po­ten­tial res­pi­ra­tory in­fec­tions”.</p>
    <p>In Bri­tain, Prime Min­is­ter Boris John­son has been wag­ing his own pro-flu shot cam­paign.</p>
    <p>Last month, he la­belled peo­ple who op­pose flu vac­cines “nuts” and an­nounced the coun­try’s largesteve­r roll­out of the shots.</p>
    <p>In April, one of the few rea­sons Aus­tralia al­lowed cit­i­zens to break the coun­try’s strict lock­down was to ven­ture out for their flu shots.</p>
    <p>A life-threat­en­ing res­pi­ra­tory ill­ness that crowds emer­gency rooms and in­ten­sive care units, flu shares symp­toms with Covid-19: fever, headache, cough, sore throat, mus­cle aches and fa­tigue.</p>
    <p>Flu can leave pa­tients vul­ner­a­ble to a harsher at­tack of Covid-19, doc­tors be­lieve, and com­ing down with both viruses at once could be dis­as­trous.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to the CDC, flu sea­son oc­curs in the au­tumn and win­ter, peak­ing from De­cem­ber to Fe­bru­ary, and so was near­ing its end as the pan­demic be­gan to flare up in the US in March.</p>
    <p>But now, fight­ing flu proac­tively dur­ing the con­tin­u­ing pan­demic presents sig­nif­i­cant chal­lenges – not only how to ad­min­is­ter the shot safely and read­ily but also how to prompt peo­ple to get a shot that a ma­jor­ity of Amer­i­cans have typ­i­cally dis­trusted, dis­missed and skipped.</p>
    <p>The United States sur­passed 170,000 coro­n­avirus deaths on Sun­day. Deaths rose by 483, with Florida, Texas and Louisiana lead­ing the rise in fatal­i­ties.</p>
    <p>The US has over 5.5 mil­lion con­firmed cases of the coro­n­avirus, the high­est in the world and likely an un­der­count as the coun­try still has not ramped up test­ing to the rec­om­mended lev­els.</p>
    <p>Cases are falling in most states ex­cept for Hawaii, South Dakota and Illi­nois.</p>
    <p>The In­sti­tute for Health Met­rics and Eval­u­a­tion is an­tic­i­pat­ing an uptick in Covid-19 cases in the com­ing months, re­sult­ing in around 300,000 to­tal deaths by De­cem­ber, and a nearly 75 per cent in­crease in hos­pi­tal­i­sa­tions.</p>
