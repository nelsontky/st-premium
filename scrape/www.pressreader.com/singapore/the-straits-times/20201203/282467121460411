    <p>• Ath­letes will need to pro­vide a neg­a­tive Covid-19 test taken less than 72 hours be­fore ar­riv­ing in Ja­pan for the Tokyo Olympics and will be tested “ev­ery 96-120 hours” dur­ing the Games, ac­cord­ing to a re­port pub­lished by or­gan­is­ers yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing talks be­tween the Tokyo 2020 or­gan­is­ing com­mit­tee, the Ja­panese gov­ern­ment and the Tokyo Metropoli­tan Gov­ern­ment, guide­lines for how the Ja­panese cap­i­tal plans to host the re­ar­ranged Games were dis­cussed.</p>
    <p>Cur­rent visi­tors to Ja­pan need to quar­an­tine for 14 days upon ar­rival but ath­letes and other key stake­hold­ers ar­riv­ing for the Games will be ex­empt from those re­stric­tions.</p>
    <p>More than 15,000 ath­letes are ex­pected to be in Tokyo for the Olympics, which be­gin on July 23 and end on Aug 8, with the ma­jor­ity stay­ing at the Ath­letes’ Village.</p>
    <p>The 54-page re­port de­tailed that a test­ing cen­tre will be set up in the village for in-com­pe­ti­tion test­ing.</p>
    <p>Last month, se­nior In­ter­na­tional Olympic Com­mit­tee (IOC) of­fi­cial John Coates said the num­ber of ath­letes at the Games would not be re­duced and it was down to or­gan­is­ers to make them feel safe. Ath­letes will also be en­cour­aged to spend less time in Tokyo.</p>
    <p>“We want to be con­sid­er­ate to the ath­letes, so the village doesn’t get too dense,” Tokyo 2020 chief ex­ec­u­tive of­fi­cer Toshiro Muto told re­porters af­ter the talks.</p>
    <p>“Af­ter the Games are fin­ished, we want the ath­letes to go back home as early as pos­si­ble.”</p>
    <p>Re­ports in the Ja­panese me­dia ear­lier yes­ter­day claimed that “large-scale” num­bers of over­seas visi­tors will be al­lowed into Tokyo for the Games.</p>
    <p>How­ever, the in­terim re­port stated that a fi­nal de­ci­sion on the num­ber of for­eign spec­ta­tors and other per­son­nel from abroad would not be de­cided un­til the spring.</p>
    <p>The Nikkei busi­ness daily re­ported that nearly 1 mil­lion tick­ets have been sold over­seas, com­pared with 4.5 mil­lion in Ja­pan.</p>
    <p>The prospect of the Games go­ing ahead safely has been boosted by the devel­op­ment of vac­cines, in­clud­ing the Pfizer shot ap­proved by Bri­tain yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>A suc­cess­ful vac­cine could make many of the Covid-19 coun­ter­mea­sures be­ing dis­cussed by Games or­gan­is­ers ob­so­lete but Muto stressed they were go­ing ahead with or with­out the vac­cine.</p>
    <p>“Re­gard­ing the vac­cine, just re­cently we have started to see pos­i­tive news but at the mo­ment it is not avail­able yet,” he said.</p>
    <p>“What might hap­pen, what could hap­pen, it is un­clear... so we are work­ing un­der the as­sump­tion that the vac­cine isn’t avail­able.”</p>
    <p>It was also re­ported that Ja­pan will give free vac­cines to all of its res­i­dents un­der a bill passed yes­ter­day. The bill, which says the gov­ern­ment will cover all vac­cine costs for Ja­pan’s 126 mil­lion res­i­dents, was ap­proved by the up­per house of par­lia­ment, hav­ing cleared the pow­er­ful lower house.</p>
    <p>Ja­pan has avoided the high rates of in­fec­tion and deaths seen in Europe and the United States but with the cold sea­son ap­proach­ing, the coun­try has posted record num­bers of daily cases in re­cent weeks.</p>
    <p>Sep­a­rately, Thomas Bach will stand un­op­posed to serve a sec­ond term as IOC pres­i­dent, the body said on Tues­day.</p>
    <p>The 66-year-old Ger­man lawyer is set to be con­firmed for a sec­ond and fi­nal four-year term at an IOC ses­sion in March in Athens.</p>
    <p>He was ini­tially elected for an eight-year term as Olympic chief in Septem­ber 2013. If re-elected, his term will end in 2025, a year af­ter the Paris Olympics.</p>
