    <p>A day af­ter new mea­sures were an­nounced to re­strict the large num­ber of peo­ple flock­ing to beaches, many were still out and about yes­ter­day, en­joy­ing the sun and play­ing in the surf.</p>
    <p>The Sun­day Times team vis­ited East Coast Park and the Siloso and Palawan beaches on Sen­tosa, and saw crowds com­pris­ing fam­i­lies, cou­ples and groups of friends alike.</p>
    <p>While many peo­ple were wear­ing masks and ad­her­ing to safe dis­tanc­ing mea­sures, there were also some who ap­peared to have aban­doned the rules put in place to com­bat the spread of the coro­n­avirus.</p>
    <p>This was in spite of warn­ings on Fri­day that en­force­ment of safe dis­tanc­ing would be stepped up and peo­ple would be stopped from en­ter­ing hot spots to pre­vent over­crowd­ing.</p>
    <p>Some peo­ple still con­gre­gated in large groups of eight to 10, while oth­ers had shed their masks while laz­ing on the beach.</p>
    <p>One of these in­stances was a group of seven women in their late 20s, who had gath­ered at Palawan Beach to cel­e­brate a friend’s birthday. They were mask-less while strik­ing yoga poses, tak­ing self­ies as well as shar­ing food and drinks.</p>
    <p>Asked about this, one of the women, who gave her name as Jaine, said it was hard to wear a mask while do­ing yoga in the sun.</p>
    <p>“It’s very hot and you can’t ex­pect us to keep our masks on when tak­ing birthday self­ies,” she said.</p>
    <p>Her friend, who wanted to be known only as Ms Lee, said she was not wor­ried as her friends had not dis­played any Covid-19 symp­toms, adding that be­ing “un­der the sun and in a windy lo­ca­tion would def­i­nitely kill the germs”.</p>
    <p>How­ever, she did ac­knowl­edge that gov­ern­ment reg­u­la­tions spec­ify that peo­ple should not gather in groups of more than five, and that masks should be worn at all times when not eat­ing, drink­ing or en­gag­ing in stren­u­ous ex­er­cise.</p>
    <p>A cou­ple in their 20s, who wanted to be known as Mr Tan and Ms Goh, were also spot­ted with­out masks on the beach at East Coast Park. Both stu­dents at a lo­cal univer­sity, they said they were ex­er­cis­ing, as they tossed a beach ball around.</p>
    <p>“We aren’t too con­cerned about not wear­ing masks while ex­er­cis­ing when we are quite far apart from other groups of peo­ple on the beach. If other peo­ple come too close to us, we’ll just move away,” said Mr Tan, adding that they had both worn their masks to the beach.</p>
    <p>Min­is­ter for Na­tional De­vel­op­ment Lawrence Wong had said on Fri­day that beaches will be “proac­tively” closed off when they ap­proach ca­pac­ity lim­its, as too carparks that are serv­ing such hot spots. He also warned that firm ac­tion will be taken against safe dis­tanc­ing breaches at such hot spots.</p>
    <p>Min­is­ter for the En­vi­ron­ment and Wa­ter Re­sources Masa­gos Zulk­i­fli noted in a Face­book post last Tues­day that “com­pla­cency” may be set­tling in among beach­go­ers.</p>
    <p>“Our Safe Dis­tanc­ing Ambassador­s and En­force­ment Of­fi­cers en­coun­tered many groups com­pris­ing more than 10 peo­ple who were from ex­tended fam­i­lies, or were friends con­gre­gat­ing. A good num­ber didn’t wear masks even when re­minded, say­ing they were eat­ing or drink­ing,” Mr Masa­gos wrote.</p>
    <p>How­ever, most peo­ple that ST spoke to yes­ter­day were toe­ing the line and fol­low­ing gov­ern­ment reg­u­la­tions.</p>
    <p>For in­stance, ac­coun­tant Joseph Lek, 31, and his wife Joanne Lim, 29, wore masks through­out their time at Palawan Beach, and had hand sani­tiser within reach on their beach tow­els next to the sun­screen.</p>
    <p>The cou­ple were en­joy­ing a week­end stay­ca­tion on Sen­tosa. While ap­pre­hen­sive at first, they de­cided to hit the beach as they were feel­ing a lit­tle “cooped-up” in their room.</p>
    <p>“We were pre­pared to leave the beach and do some­thing else on the is­land if there were too many peo­ple. Af­ter all, hav­ing a fun day out is one thing, but we want to stay safe,” said Ms Lim, who is an ad­min­is­tra­tive as­sis­tant at a lo­cal food and bev­er­age com­pany.</p>
    <p>Ad­ver­tis­ing ex­ec­u­tive Sheena Loh, 32, who was at Siloso Beach with two friends, said they were not shar­ing food and drinks as they would have be­fore the Covid-19 pan­demic, and were stay­ing masked up even when out in the sun.</p>
    <p>“This is the first time we’ve been out to­gether in a while, my friends and I haven’t met since the cir­cuit breaker started,” she said.</p>
    <p>She ex­pressed re­lief that fur­ther curbs on the num­ber of peo­ple at beaches would be put in place.</p>
    <p>“I spot­ted peo­ple who were sneez­ing and cough­ing be­hind their masks while walk­ing around Sen­tosa. I hope we can all con­tinue to be more civic-minded, so we can con­tinue to have fun in the small pock­ets of free time we have,” Ms Loh said.</p>

While many peo&#xAD;ple were wear&#xAD;ing masks and ad&#xAD;her&#xAD;ing to safe dis&#xAD;tanc&#xAD;ing mea&#xAD;sures at Sin&#xAD;ga&#xAD;pore&#x2019;s beaches, there were also some who ap&#xAD;peared to have aban&#xAD;doned the rules put in place to com&#xAD;bat the spread of the coro&#xAD;n&#xAD;avirus.</p>
