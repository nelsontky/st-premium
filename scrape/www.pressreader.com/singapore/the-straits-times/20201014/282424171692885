    </section>

    <p>Sex And The City (1998 to 2004) star Kim Cattrall re­turns to tele­vi­sion to play yet another for­mi­da­ble woman – this time in Filthy Rich, a soap opera-style drama about the widow of a tel­e­van­ge­list whose chil­dren are fight­ing over his for­tune.</p>
    <p>And Cattrall, 64, can­didly ad­mits that this and other roles have helped her deal with her own midlife ex­is­ten­tial crises.</p>
    <p>The Cana­dian-Amer­i­can star was speak­ing to re­porters in Los An­ge­les about the new se­ries, which airs on Tues­days at 11pm on Fox Life (Sing­tel TV Chan­nel 301, StarHub TV Chan­nel 501) and streams on Fox+.</p>
    <p>She plays Mar­garet Mon­reaux, who co-founded a Chris­tian tele­vi­sion net­work with her de­vout hus­band. But when he dies in a plane crash, Mar­garet has to con­tend with the sud­den ap­pear­ance of his three il­le­git­i­mate chil­dren.</p>
    <p>Cattrall ex­plains why she took on the role – and why it took a while for her to re­turn to TV fol­low­ing Sex And The City, the raunchy hit com­edy about four fe­male friends liv­ing in New York. She had played Sa­man­tha, the ir­re­press­ible maneater – a part that won her the 2002 Best Sup­port­ing Ac­tress Golden Globe.</p>
    <p>“It wasn’t un­til I saw Sen­si­tive Skin that I re­ally wanted to go back to tele­vi­sion,” she says, re­fer­ring to the 2014 to 2016 Cana­dian com­edy se­ries that also saw her play a char­ac­ter nav­i­gat­ing mid­dle age.</p>
    <p>“I was hav­ing a lot of ques­tions about midlife cri­sis, about menopause, about ‘ What now? What is the next chap­ter of my life?’”, says Cattrall, who also starred in the two Sex And The City films (2008 and 2010) and the Swedish TV thriller Modus (2015 to now).</p>
    <p>And with Filthy Rich, her own real-life is­sues are once again re­flected on screen.</p>
    <p>“She’s in her 60s like I am,” she says of Mar­garet. “And you’re start­ing to lose your fam­ily mem­bers, you’re start­ing to lose friends. It does bring up the ques­tion: What now and how much longer?”</p>
    <p>Tak­ing on the part al­lowed her to ex­am­ine some of that.</p>
    <p>“I like to work things out in my work. And if I have these ques­tions, maybe other women are hav­ing them,” the star says.</p>
    <p>And as campy as her Filthy Rich char­ac­ter is, she also has vast re­serves of strength.</p>
    <p>“She didn’t come from much but she had self-be­lief, she had faith, she had fam­ily. And that’s what brought her to where she is to­day. She’s go­ing to rule the world,” says Cattrall, who has been mar­ried three times. She di­vorced jazz mu­si­cian Mark Levin­son in 2004.</p>
    <p>The ac­tress ob­serves that on the pro­duc­tion side, TV has evolved since the days of Sex And The City and is, in some ways, more chal­leng­ing for per­form­ers.</p>
    <p>“We don’t cut any­more, we just keep go­ing. Ev­ery­thing is dig­i­tal. In­stead of one or two cam­eras, we have five cam­eras,” she ob­serves.</p>
    <p>This keeps her on her toes a bit more. “You can’t warm up to a close-up – you have to be right on your game all the time.”</p>
    <p>Still, it was fun help­ing to launch a new TV show once again.</p>
    <p>“I had forgotten what it was like, the first cou­ple of years (on a new show). It evolved and kept evolv­ing, I had forgotten about those first steps,” the ac­tress says.</p>
    <p>And she loved ev­ery minute of it – es­pe­cially the chance to col­lab­o­rate with a whole new set of peo­ple.</p>
    <p>“This has re­ally been a valen­tine of an ex­pe­ri­ence for me so far.</p>
    <p>“We’re all very dif­fer­ent, but we have a won­der­ful cast and crew and it’s about be­ing part of a com­mu­nity – telling a story to­gether,” she says.</p>
    <p>Filthy Rich airs on Tues­days at 11pm on Fox Life (Sing­tel TV Chan­nel 301, StarHub TV Chan­nel 501) and streams on Fox+.</p>
