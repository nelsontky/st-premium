    <p>BEI­JING • China is plan­ning a more than 1 tril­lion yuan (S$200 bil­lion) push to ac­cel­er­ate in­fra­struc­ture in­vest­ment in Ti­bet, in­clud­ing new and pre­vi­ously an­nounced projects, three sources fa­mil­iar with the mat­ter told Reuters.</p>
    <p>The re­newed push to step up de­vel­op­ment of the re­mote and im­pov­er­ished south-west­ern re­gion sig­nals Bei­jing’s in­tent to bol­ster fron­tier se­cu­rity amid height­ened bor­der ten­sions with In­dia in re­cent months, two of the sources said.</p>
    <p>Last week, dur­ing a se­nior Com­mu­nist Party meet­ing on Ti­bet’s fu­ture gover­nance, Pres­i­dent Xi Jin­ping lauded achieve­ments and praised front­line of­fi­cials, but said more ef­forts were needed to en­rich, re­ju­ve­nate and strengthen unity in the re­gion. He said a num­ber of ma­jor in­fra­struc­ture projects and pub­lic fa­cil­i­ties would be com­pleted, in­clud­ing the Sichuan-Ti­bet Rail­way, ac­cord­ing to re­marks pub­lished by China’s of­fi­cial Xinhua news agency.</p>
    <p>The con­struc­tion plans in­clude com­ple­tion of the chal­leng­ing mid­dle sec­tion of a high-el­e­va­tion Sichuan-Ti­bet rail­way link, a rail­way line be­tween Nepal and Ti­bet that has re­mained in the plan­ning stages, and a newly planned dry port in the Ti­bet Au­ton­o­mous Re­gion, the sources said. The sources de­clined to be iden­ti­fied be­cause they were not au­tho­rised to speak with me­dia.</p>
    <p>It was not im­me­di­ately clear how much of the tar­geted spend­ing is new, or over how many years it would be in­vested.</p>
    <p>Con­struc­tion on the most dif­fi­cult sec­tion of the Sichuan-Ti­bet rail­way– link­ing Chengdu with Lhasa – will be­gin in com­ing weeks, said two of the sources.</p>
    <p>The 270 bil­lion yuan sec­tion of the rail­way has been known for build­ing chal­lenges posed by rough ter­rain and com­plex ge­ol­ogy, no­tably the seg­ment link­ing Sichuan’s Ya’an city with Ny­ingchi in south-east­ern Ti­bet near the bor­der with In­dia.</p>
    <p>Bei­jing also wants to push ahead with the Ti­bet-Nepal Rail­way link­ing Kath­mandu with Shi­gatse, the se­cond-largest city in Ti­bet, which was among a num­ber of bi­lat­eral deals signed in 2018 be­tween Nepal and China, but has yet to gain much trac­tion.</p>
    <p>Nepal is a buf­fer be­tween China and In­dia and is con­sid­ered by New Delhi as its nat­u­ral ally, but China has made in­roads by pour­ing aid and in­fra­struc­ture in­vest­ment into what is one of the world’s poor­est coun­tries.</p>
    <p>A June clash in the west­ern part of the China-In­dia bor­der was the worst vi­o­lence be­tween the Asian gi­ants in decades, and there is lit­tle sign of eas­ing ten­sion, with more mil­i­tary ac­tion in the past week.</p>
    <p>Bei­jing has long aimed to build a high-speed rail net­work to make Ti­bet more ac­ces­si­ble from China’s in­land prov­inces, and it plans to im­prove or ex­tend rail­ways be­ing planned or con­structed that con­nect it with other parts of China, two of the sources said.</p>
    <p>Last month, China an­nounced plans to ex­pand the coun­try’s rail­way net­work by one-third over the next 15 years.</p>
    <p>Within Ti­bet, the planned spend­ing cov­ers the re­vamp and ex­pan­sion of high­ways, roads and scenic spots, two of the sources said.</p>
    <p>Bei­jing sent troops into Ti­bet in 1950 in what it of­fi­cially terms a peace­ful lib­er­a­tion and main­tains a heavy se­cu­rity pres­ence in the re­gion, which has been prone to un­rest. It re­jects crit­i­cism from rights groups and Ti­betan ex­iles of its rule there, say­ing it has brought much­needed de­vel­op­ment to a re­mote re­gion and that it re­spects Ti­bet’s cul­ture and re­li­gion.</p>
    <p>China’s poli­cies to­wards Ti­bet have come un­der the spot­light again this year amid wors­en­ing ties with the United States.</p>
    <p>In July, US Sec­re­tary of State Mike Pom­peo said the United States would re­strict visas for some Chi­nese of­fi­cials in­volved in block­ing diplo­matic ac­cess to Ti­bet and en­gag­ing in “hu­man rights abuses”.</p>
