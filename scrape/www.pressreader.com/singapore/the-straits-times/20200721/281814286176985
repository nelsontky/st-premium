    <p>LON­DON • Bri­tain yes­ter­day said it would sus­pend its ex­tra­di­tion treaty with Hong Kong as it es­ca­lated a dis­pute with China over the in­tro­duc­tion of a na­tional se­cu­rity law for the for­mer Bri­tish colony.</p>
    <p>For­eign Sec­re­tary Do­minic Raab told Par­lia­ment the treaty would be sus­pended im­me­di­ately and that an arms em­bargo would be ex­tended to Hong Kong.</p>
    <p>“The im­po­si­tion of this new se­cu­rity leg­is­la­tion has sig­nif­i­cantly changed key as­sump­tions un­der­pin­ning our ex­tra­di­tion treaty ar­range­ments with Hong Kong,” Mr Raab told law­mak­ers yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>“We will not con­sider re­ac­ti­vat­ing those ar­range­ments, un­less and un­til there are clear and ro­bust safe­guards, which are able to pre­vent ex­tra­di­tion from the UK be­ing mis­used un­der the new na­tional se­cu­rity leg­is­la­tion.”</p>
    <p>The ban is an­other nail in the cof­fin of what then Prime Min­is­ter David Cameron in 2015 cast as a “golden era” of ties with China, the world’s sec­ond-largest econ­omy.</p>
    <p>Lon­don has been dis­mayed by a crack­down in Hong Kong, which re­turned to Chi­nese rule in 1997, and the per­cep­tion that China did not tell the whole truth about the coro­n­avirus out­break.</p>
    <p>Last week, Prime Min­is­ter Boris John­son or­dered Huawei Tech­nolo­gies equip­ment to be purged com­pletely from Bri­tain’s 5G net­work by the end of 2027.</p>
    <p>China has ac­cused Bri­tain of pan­der­ing to the United States.</p>
    <p>Prior to Mr Raab’s an­nounce­ment, China had urged Bri­tain to avoid tak­ing fur­ther steps down the wrong path. Chi­nese For­eign Min­istry spokesman Wang Wen­bin yes­ter­day warned that Beijing would re­act res­o­lutely to ac­tions in Hong Kong that in­ter­fere with China’s in­ter­nal af­fairs.</p>
    <p>China’s am­bas­sador to Bri­tain also is­sued a sim­i­lar warn­ing on Sun­day.</p>
    <p>“If the UK gov­ern­ment goes that far to im­pose sanc­tions on any in­di­vid­ual in China, China will cer­tainly make a res­o­lute re­sponse to it,” Mr Liu Xiaom­ing told the BBC’s An­drew Marr Show.</p>
    <p>“You’ve seen what hap­pens in the United States – they sanc­tion Chi­nese of­fi­cials, we sanc­tion their sen­a­tors, their of­fi­cials. I do not want to see this tit-for-tat hap­pen in... China-UK re­la­tions.”</p>
    <p>Bri­tain says the se­cu­rity l aw breaches agree­ments made be­fore the 1997 han­dover of Hong Kong to Chi­nese rule, and that China is crush­ing free­doms that have helped make the city one of the world’s big­gest fi­nan­cial hubs.</p>
    <p>Hong Kong and Beijing of­fi­cials have said the law is vi­tal to plug holes in na­tional se­cu­rity de­fences ex­posed by re­cent protests.</p>
    <p>China has re­peat­edly told Western pow­ers to stop med­dling in Hong Kong’s af­fairs.</p>
    <p>Aus­tralia and Canada sus­pended their ex­tra­di­tion treaties with Hong Kong ear­lier this month.</p>
    <p>You’ve seen what hap­pens in the United States – they sanc­tion Chi­nese of­fi­cials, we sanc­tion their sen­a­tors, their of­fi­cials. I do not want to see this tit-for-tat hap­pen ’’ in... China-UK re­la­tions.</p>
    <p>MR LIU XIAOM­ING, China’s am­bas­sador to Bri­tain, on the BBC’s An­drew Marr Show.</p>
