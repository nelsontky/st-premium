    <p>My work cal­en­dar has meet­ings, dead­lines, re­minders about projects and other im­por­tant events.</p>
    <p>Some­times, it also in­cludes an in­vi­ta­tion to a chit-chat ses­sion with friends from work, usu­ally over a cup of our favourite hot bev­er­age.</p>
    <p>Be­fore it is time to join the once-in-a-while friendly chat, I quickly brew my cuppa, run a comb through my un­kempt hair, make sure there’s no un­sightly food or kitchen stain on my tee or teeth, neaten the back­drop of the area from where I shall join the call, lo­cate my ear­phones and prac­tise my smile.</p>
    <p>We may ex­change text mes­sages al­most ev­ery day, but look­ing at faces and hear­ing the sound of voices make a world of dif­fer­ence.</p>
    <p>Topics of the chit-chat range from hob­bies, the lat­est in­ter­est­ing meal we had or made, gar­den­ing, books, Net­flix, walks, work ideas, mini work rants and masks to the weather, travel mem­o­ries and the other usual stuff that make up an ex­change with­out a fixed agenda.</p>
    <p>It is any­thing but in­con­se­quen­tial. Ev­ery­one gets to speak and say their piece in the free­wheel­ing man­ner char­ac­ter­is­tic of a friendly chat.</p>
    <p>Some­times, it is very dif­fi­cult to eke out that half an hour from our busy sched­ules. Some­times, one of us can­not make it. Some­times, one joins late or has to leave early. But the ban­ter never fails to en­er­gise, de­com­press, lighten and mo­ti­vate.</p>
    <p>Work­ing from home can get lonely with­out the usual face-to-face shar­ing of ideas. The stresses re­lated to the pan­demic sit­u­a­tion we are in, cou­pled with ev­ery­day pres­sures, be­come a bit too much to take.</p>
    <p>Ne­ti­zens on so­cial me­dia have been reach­ing out to have cof­fee ses­sions to share thoughts and ideas with other sim­i­lar-think­ing in­di­vid­u­als.</p>
    <p>Twit­ter user @fair­ban_c, a DPhil can­di­date in English from Ox­ford Uni­ver­sity, sent out a feeler last week.</p>
    <p>“Would any early mod­ernists be up for a pe­ri­odic vir­tual cof­fee via Zoom to chat about our work and ideas? Been re­ally miss­ing this over lock­down – #BritGrad20­20 last week re­minded me how lovely and in­spir­ing th­ese chats can be!” she wrote.</p>
    <p>Her query got a string of yeses in re­sponse.</p>
    <p>Like most of us who have found some pos­i­tive sides to work­ing from home while miss­ing some as­pects of go­ing to the work­place, the Nether­lands-based Twit­ter user @MHLut says she likes some things about this sit­u­a­tion.</p>
    <p>“No forced touch­ing (hand­shakes) for ex­am­ple, and re­duced travel time. The best thing though is that I’m not over­bur­dened by sounds; I was at the of­fice once, and more than ever re­alised how much I hate work­ing in shared spa­ces,” she wrote in a thread.</p>
    <p>“But it’s also funny be­cause even as an in­tro­vert I was super happy to see my col­leagues again (pro­vided, they are pretty awe­some peo­ple) and I’d love to at­tend a phys­i­cal meetup again,” she con­tin­ued.</p>
    <p>Like her, I am grate­ful for the travel time saved when work­ing from home. But I do miss the sounds of a workspace.</p>
    <p>Even though there is con­stant in­ter­ac­tion with col­leagues over e-mails, Google Han­gouts mes­sages and con­fer­ence calls, some small things go miss­ing, such as the sound of the key­board clat­ter­ing, the mouse click­ing, the ex­pres­sions on faces, the mur­mur­ing of voices, the ring­ing of phones, the nod­ding of heads in agree­ment, the im­pa­tient drum­ming of fin­gers on the ta­ble, the “hi, how are yous” at the lift lobby, the fire alarm drill on some morn­ings – okay, maybe not the last one.</p>
    <p>Now that the Min­istry of Health here has said that more peo­ple can go back to the work­place from to­mor­row, would be­ing back in the of­fice for some hours or days of the week feel weird af­ter months of turn­ing our liv­ing room space into a work area?</p>
    <p>Would a masked-face-to-masked-face in­ter­ac­tion mean the same thing as a face-to-face one?</p>
    <p>One thing I have no­ticed, though, is some­times, you can’t re­ally hear the other per­son very clearly be­hind the mask un­less he is speak­ing loudly or you are sit­ting close, es­pe­cially if the sur­round­ing is noisy. Does that de­feat the pur­pose?</p>
    <p>I guess ges­tures like a wave, a thumbs up, a nod will be a big part of con­ver­sa­tions when we are back at the work­place.</p>
    <p>Maybe I should start prac­tis­ing my “smize” – learn­ing to smile through my eyes.</p>
    <p>CLUT­TER IN THE HOUSE</p>
    <p>While there is a way to re­move the clut­ter in the mind by talk­ing about it over a vir­tual chat, some of those who are work­ing at home can­not con­trol the clut­ter ac­cu­mu­lat­ing in the space as all mem­bers of the house­hold spend more time in­doors.</p>
    <p>Peo­ple are look­ing to make bet­ter use of their homes as they try to divide space be­tween work, school and re­tired fam­ily mem­bers.</p>
    <p>Ms Marie Kondo, the Ja­panese tidy­ing guru, says she no­ticed a spike in queries re­lated to or­gan­is­ing home clut­ter as the Covid-19 pan­demic keeps peo­ple in­doors most of the time.</p>
    <p>In re­sponse, she has in­tro­duced the 10-episode KonMari Method: Fun­da­men­tals Of Tidy­ing on­line course, avail­able for pur­chase on her web­site.</p>
    <p>“Peo­ple are spend­ing more time than ever at home, so this course is an op­por­tu­nity to help them tidy up and re­dis­cover their joy,” Ms</p>
    <p>Kondo told Apart­ment Ther­apy, a lifestyle web­site.</p>
    <p>If you are look­ing for ideas that don’t cost money, there are plenty on­line too.</p>
    <p>When Twit­ter user @paulaalore­naa asked for some ad­vice on main­tain­ing a clean and clut­ter-free home, one of the sug­ges­tions she re­ceived was from @whatismedi­cine, who said: “For me what seems to work is com­mit­ting to putting things away right af­ter I use them, like if I put one dish in the sink it’ll be a pile in no time. That and also vac­u­um­ing ev­ery Sun­day.”</p>
    <p>While another Twit­ter user @kateas­t­erisk sug­gested some­thing I fol­low too: “I pur­pose­fully looked for 10 things to put away when I went into a new room. The lit­tle bit adds up with­out hav­ing to take half a Saturday. Hav­ing no clut­ter made clean­ing fast.”</p>
    <p>There are al­ways two sides to the coin, and some peo­ple are at their cre­ative best amid chaos.</p>
    <p>A Na­tional Geo­graphic ar­ti­cle last month cited in­no­va­tive thinkers with messy desks such as Al­bert Ein­stein and Mr Steve Jobs.</p>
    <p>At the same time, it also pointed to stud­ies that showed a clut­ter-free en­vi­ron­ment can lead to more ef­fi­ciency. It de­pends on what works for you – clut­ter-free or not.</p>
