    <p>For­mer seam­stress Yeo Ai’s home had been a haven of hos­pi­tal­ity for the past six decades, with rel­a­tives and neigh­bours ea­gerly gath­er­ing for home-cooked food and hand­made tra­di­tional kueh, but the good times have fi­nally drawn to a close.</p>
    <p>The lights at the two-storey unit in Gey­lang Lorong 3 dimmed on Nov 21 when Madam Yeo, 79, bade farewell to the house she had called home since 1964.</p>
    <p>Madam Yeo is one of the last few own­ers to va­cate their homes be­fore the es­tate’s 60-year lease ex­pires on Dec 31.</p>
    <p>As at Dec 3, there were 37 owner-oc­cu­pied units, with most in the process of mov­ing out be­fore the dead­line, said the Sin­ga­pore Land Au­thor­ity (SLA).</p>
    <p>Madam Yeo has tem­po­rar­ily moved into her daugh­ter’s Hous­ing Board flat in Sims Drive while she waits for her Build-To-Or­der flat in Kal­lang to be ready at the end of next year.</p>
    <p>Her son Koh Chee Kiong, 53, a me­chanic pro­gram­mer, will con­tinue to live in the house till the end of the lease be­fore j oin­ing Madam Yeo.</p>
    <p>For Madam Yeo, af­ter liv­ing in a landed prop­erty for almost six decades, the lift has proven the big­gest hur­dle.</p>
    <p>“Liv­ing in an HDB flat is OK, but I’m most afraid of tak­ing the lift by my­self, and I pre­fer if some­one else ac­com­pa­nies me,” she said.</p>
    <p>Her hobby of mak­ing ang ku kueh (red tor­toise shell-shaped cakes) and other tra­di­tional kueh has also taken a back­seat as space is lim­ited in her daugh­ter’s five­room flat – un­like the large porch and kitchen in the Gey­lang Lorong 3 unit.</p>
    <p>Her daugh­ter Joyce Koh, 56, who grew up in the house, lamented that her only re­gret is not be­ing able to host an es­tate farewell party be­fore mov­ing, as large gath­er­ings are not al­lowed be­cause of the Covid-19 out­break.</p>
    <p>“If we could, we would’ve set up ta­bles along the street and in­vited all of our ex-neigh­bours back for one last farewell party and made it su­per grand,” said Ms Koh, who works in the fi­nan­cial sec­tor.</p>
    <p>This is the first time a res­i­den­tial plot of land in in­de­pen­dent Sin­ga­pore has reached the end of its lease.</p>
    <p>All home own­ers have to hand back their homes to the SLA with no com­pen­sa­tion.</p>
    <p>Of the 191 ter­raced units lo­cated there, five have been re­turned to the state.</p>
    <p>An­other 149 units are mainly used as for­eign work­ers’ ac­com­mo­da­tion, with 16 be­ing used for re­li­gious pur­poses.</p>
    <p>A fam­ily-run tem­ple, Sri Jad­dah Muneeswara­r Tem­ple, is still look­ing for an al­ter­na­tive lo­ca­tion. It has been in the es­tate for the past 11 years.</p>
    <p>Peng Feng Gong, a Taoist clan tem­ple that has been in Gey­lang Lorong 3 for the past 20 years, has found a new home in Lorong 25A Gey­lang, although it is still un­der ren­o­va­tion.</p>
    <p>In the mean­time, the deities have been moved to a tem­po­rary lo­ca­tion in Hougang Av­enue 3, af­ter an elab­o­rate re­li­gious cer­e­mony.</p>
    <p>Fourth-gen­er­a­tion mem­ber Kervin Tan, 23, who works in the ma­rine sec­tor, said: “Gey­lang Lorong 3 is the first per­ma­nent tem­ple we have had since the deities came to Sin­ga­pore from China in 1958, so we all have a lot of fond mem­o­ries of this space.”</p>
    <p>ONE LAST FAREWELL PARTY</p>
    <p>If we could, we would’ve set up ta­bles along the street and in­vited all of our ex-neigh­bours back for one last farewell party and made it su­per grand.</p>
    <p>’’</p>
    <p>MS JOYCE KOH, who grew up in the house, on her only re­gret, as large gath­er­ings are not al­lowed be­cause of the Covid-19 out­break.</p>
