    <p>We re­fer to the re­cent let­ters re­lated to the in­scrip­tion of Sin­ga­pore’s hawker cul­ture on the Unesco Rep­re­sen­ta­tive List of the In­tan­gi­ble Cul­tural Her­itage of Hu­man­ity (Time to work on clean­li­ness, hy­giene stan­dards; Three predica­ments faced by the hawker trade, both Dec 18; Re­duce stall ren­tal to help hawk­ers sur­vive, Dec 21;</p>
    <p>No let­ting up on drive to cul­ti­vate clean­li­ness cul­ture, Dec 31).</p>
    <p>We agree that clean­li­ness in our hawker cen­tres can be improved.</p>
    <p>Food rem­nants, soiled crock­ery, tis­sue pa­per and wipes left on ta­bles lead to bird nui­sance and pose a public health risk to pa­trons, clean­ers and hawk­ers. They are also a blight on our hawker cen­tres. Ev­ery­one should re­turn their used crock­ery and trays as a cour­tesy to the next diner. A self-ser­vice con­cept will also lessen the work­load of our clean­ers.</p>
    <p>Since 2013, we have in­tro­duced sev­eral tray re­turn ini­tia­tives, in­clud­ing be­havioural nudges (with vis­ual and au­dio cues), pub­lic­ity cam­paigns and in­fras­truc­tural im­prove­ments, such as the au­to­matic tray re­turn sys­tem with tray de­posit.</p>
    <p>From June last year, SG Clean am­bas­sadors have also been ad­vis­ing pa­trons to bin their lit­ter left on ta­bles, and to re­turn trays and used crock­ery.</p>
    <p>While there has been some im­prove­ment, progress is slow.</p>
    <p>Tray re­turn rates at hawker cen­tres in Adam Road and Tiong</p>
    <p>Bahru are en­cour­ag­ing, at be­tween 60 per cent and 70 per cent, but at most hawker cen­tres, the av­er­age is only around 30 per cent.</p>
    <p>Covid-19 has un­der­scored the im­por­tance of clean­li­ness, and more needs to be done. With phase three of the na­tion’s re­open­ing, the Na­tional En­vi­ron­ment Agency (NEA) is re­view­ing the ap­proach to main­tain­ing ta­ble clean­li­ness at hawker cen­tres.</p>
    <p>On the is­sue of stall ren­tal, about 36 per cent of cooked-food hawk­ers are still on the sub­sidised rent scheme. Most hawk­ers rent stalls through NEA’s ten­der ex­er­cises. There is no min­i­mum bid and al­most 40 per cent of stalls are awarded to bids be­low 85 per cent of the as­sessed mar­ket rent, with some as low as $1. Ad­di­tion­ally, the Govern­ment fully funds hawker cen­tre de­vel­op­ment and up­grad­ing, and is sub­si­dis­ing the cost of cen­tralised dish­wash­ing ser­vices.</p>
    <p>These ef­forts have helped to keep ren­tals low, with the me­dian cooked-food stall ren­tal across all hawker cen­tres at $1,250 monthly.</p>
    <p>On sus­tain­ing the hawker trade, we have var­i­ous in­cu­ba­tion pro­grammes where new hawker en­trants are in their 30s and 40s, lower than the na­tional me­dian age of hawk­ers at 59. In ad­di­tion, we will be pi­lot­ing a new hawk­ers suc­ces­sion scheme to fur­ther fa­cil­i­tate re­tir­ing vet­eran hawk­ers pass­ing down stalls and recipes to the next gen­er­a­tion of hawk­ers.</p>
    <p>We will con­tinue to work with all stake­hold­ers to keep our hawker cen­tres clean, and safe­guard our hawker cul­ture for fu­ture gen­er­a­tions.</p>
