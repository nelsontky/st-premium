    <p>Sin­ga­pore­ans can now view their funds and in­vest­ments on a sin­gle on­line plat­form in­stead of hav­ing to visit each bank’s or gov­ern­ment agency’s web­site, sav­ing time and mak­ing their fi­nan­cial plan­ning eas­ier and more ef­fec­tive.</p>
    <p>This is made pos­si­ble by the Sin­ga­pore Fi­nan­cial Data Ex­change, or SGFinDex, a free dig­i­tal ser­vice un­veiled by Deputy Prime Min­is­ter Heng Swee Keat dur­ing his open­ing ad­dress at the Sin­ga­pore Fin­Tech Fes­ti­val and Sin­ga­pore Week of In­no­va­tion and Tech­nol­ogy yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>“This is the world’s first pub­lic dig­i­tal in­fra­struc­ture that al­lows a per­son to sign in us­ing his na­tional dig­i­tal iden­tity and pro­vide con­sent to ob­tain his fi­nan­cial in­for­ma­tion from dif­fer­ent fi­nan­cial in­sti­tu­tions and gov­ern­ment agen­cies,” said Mr Heng, who is also Fi­nance Min­is­ter and Co­or­di­nat­ing Min­is­ter for Eco­nomic Poli­cies.</p>
    <p>“Such an ap­proach to trusted data shar­ing – in­volv­ing both in­no­va­tion and con­ducive reg­u­la­tions – can po­ten­tially be ap­plied in other ar­eas and in other ju­ris­dic­tions,” he said.</p>
    <p>Here are five things to know about SGFinDex.</p>
    <p>1</p>
    <p>WHAT IS IT?</p>
    <p>SGFinDex is a dig­i­tal in­fra­struc­ture that rides on SingPass, Sin­ga­pore’s na­tional dig­i­tal iden­tity sys­tem. It was de­vel­oped by the pub­lic sec­tor in col­lab­o­ra­tion with the As­so­ci­a­tion of Banks in Sin­ga­pore and par­tic­i­pat­ing banks.</p>
    <p>Af­ter giv­ing ex­plicit con­sent and us­ing their SingPass, Sin­ga­pore­ans can choose to pool all their fi­nan­cial data on ac­count bal­ances, credit cards, loans and in­vest­ments from their banks, and from gov­ern­ment agen­cies, and view them on a plat­form of their choice.</p>
    <p>For now, there are seven par­tic­i­pat­ing banks – Citibank, POSB and DBS Bank, HSBC, May­bank, OCBC Bank, Stan­dard Char­tered Bank and United Over­seas Bank.</p>
    <p>Users will also be able to re­trieve data from three gov­ern­ment agen­cies – the Cen­tral Prov­i­dent Fund, the Hous­ing Board and the In­land Rev­enue Au­thor­ity of Sin­ga­pore – via MyInfo, the Gov­ern­ment’s on­estop data plat­form.</p>
    <p>In­for­ma­tion on in­surance poli­cies and stock hold­ings at the Cen­tral De­pos­i­tory will be in­cluded in the next phase of SGFinDex.</p>
    <p>Banks have also tapped SGFinDex to of­fer fi­nan­cial plan­ning ser­vices, in­clud­ing re­tire­ment plan­ning and in­surance needs.</p>
    <p>Mon­e­tary Au­thor­ity of Sin­ga­pore man­ag­ing di­rec­tor Ravi Menon said: “SGFinDex em­pow­ers the in­di­vid­ual to con­sol­i­date his fi­nan­cial in­for­ma­tion for a com­pre­hen­sive view of his port­fo­lio, and use dig­i­tal tools like My­Money­Sense to make bet­ter fi­nan­cial de­ci­sions.”</p>
    <p>2</p>
    <p>HOW DOES IT WORK?</p>
    <p>Users can opt to view their con­sol­i­dated fi­nan­cial in­for­ma­tion via the Gov­ern­ment’s new dig­i­tal fi­nan­cial plan­ning ser­vice My­Money­Sense, or any of the seven banks’ fi­nan­cial plan­ning web­sites or mo­bile ap­pli­ca­tions.</p>
    <p>If you choose a bank, you will need to have an In­ter­net bank­ing ac­count with it.</p>
    <p>To start, you will need to log in us­ing SingPass to ver­ify your iden­tity on My­Money­Sense or any of the par­tic­i­pat­ing banks’ apps or web­sites. You will then be redi­rected to the SGFinDex page, where you can pro­ceed to con­nect your ac­counts to var­i­ous fi­nan­cial in­sti­tu­tions and au­tho­rise the trans­fer of data.</p>
    <p>Your slew of fi­nan­cial data will be dis­played on the cho­sen plat­form, whether it is My­Money­Sense or one of the banks’ apps or web­sites.</p>
    <p>3</p>
    <p>HOW LONG DOES MY CON­SENT FOR DATA RE­LEASE LAST?</p>
    <p>Your con­sent pe­riod will last for one year from the time the first con­sent was pro­vided.</p>
    <p>For ex­am­ple, if you give your con­sent to one bank to pro­vide your data through SGFinDex on Jan 1, 2021, and sub­se­quently pro­vide con­sent to an­other bank on March 1, 2021, both th­ese au­tho­ri­sa­tions will ex­pire on Dec 31, 2021.</p>
    <p>You will need to pro­vide con­sent again if you wish to re­lease your data from Jan 1, 2022.</p>
    <p>4</p>
    <p>DO I NEED TO PAY TO USE SGFINDEX?</p>
    <p>You will cur­rently not be charged whether you choose to ac­cess your con­sol­i­dated data via My­Money­Sense or a par­tic­i­pat­ing bank.</p>
    <p>5</p>
    <p>HOW SAFE IS THE SYS­TEM? CAN PEO­PLE STEAL OR COPY MY DATA?</p>
    <p>There are strin­gent se­cu­rity mea­sures in place to safe­guard per­sonal data that passes through SGFinDex. It will trans­mit but not store any per­sonal fi­nan­cial data.</p>
    <p>Your data is en­crypted when it is re­trieved through SGFinDex and only the app or web­site that you have au­tho­rised to re­ceive your data is able to de­crypt it.</p>
    <p>The au­then­ti­ca­tion and au­tho­ri­sa­tion process must be ver­i­fied through SingPass, and ex­plicit user con­sent is re­quired for each data re­trieval.</p>
    <p>Users can re­voke their con­sent for banks to re­lease data at any time, ei­ther through the banks’ apps or web­sites, or through the My­Money­Sense web­site.</p>
