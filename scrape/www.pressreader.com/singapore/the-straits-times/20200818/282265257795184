    <p>The bench­mark Straits Times In­dex (STI) ended yes­ter­day down 9.77 points or 0.4 per cent at 2,571.55, even af­ter the Sin­ga­pore Govern­ment un­veiled ad­di­tional sup­port mea­sures to­talling $8 bil­lion to tide work­ers and busi­nesses over the coro­n­avirus pan­demic.</p>
    <p>The best per­former among the in­dex con­stituents was Thai Bev­er­age Pub­lic Com­pany (ThaiBev), which gained 4.96 per cent for the day to close at $0.635. It was also the most heav­ily traded stock, with 470.2 mil­lion shares traded over the course of the day. This came af­ter the bev­er­age gi­ant posted re­silient rev­enue and Ebitda – net in­come with in­ter­est, taxes, de­pre­ci­a­tion, and amor­ti­sa­tion – de­spite the novel coro­n­avirus pan­demic.</p>
    <p>The STI’s big­gest de­cliner for the day was Gent­ing Sin­ga­pore, which lost 2.8 per cent to close at $0.70.</p>
    <p>The trio of banks ended the day mixed. Shares of DBS Bank and OCBC Bank fell 0.3 per cent and 0.4 per cent to close at $21 and $8.91 re­spec­tively, while United Over­seas Bank inched up 0.05 per cent to close at $20.08.</p>
    <p>Else­where in Asia, mar­kets were mixed. Weigh­ing on in­vestors’ minds are the on­go­ing Chi­naUnited States ten­sions and Washington law­mak­ers’ strug­gle to ham­mer out a much-needed new stim­u­lus.</p>
    <p>An­a­lysts said there was little re­ac­tion to news that trade re­view talks be­tween the su­per­pow­ers due to have taken place on Satur­day had been post­poned, though US Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump kept up his drum­beat against Bei­jing, warn­ing he could tar­get more Chi­nese tech firms, in­clud­ing Alibaba. The Pres­i­dent’s warn­ing came as he is­sued an­other ex­ec­u­tive or­der stat­ing that In­ter­net gi­ant ByteDance must sell its in­ter­est in the Mu­si­cal.ly app it bought and merged with TikTok.</p>
    <p>While the mea­sure did not cause a mar­ket sell-off, there are wor­ries about how much Mr Trump will ratchet up ten­sions with Bei­jing as he strug­gles to re­tain the White House in Novem­ber, with opin­ion polls show­ing him trail­ing Mr Joe Bi­den in key bat­tle­grounds.</p>
    <p>Ja­pan’s Nikkei 225 lost 0.8 per cent af­ter official data showed the Ja­panese econ­omy ex­pe­ri­enced a record quar­terly con­trac­tion in the three months to June.</p>
    <p>The FTSE Bursa Malaysia KLCI In­dex dipped 0.3 per cent.</p>
    <p>In con­trast, the Hang Seng Com­pos­ite In­dex gained 0.6 per cent and the Shang­hai Com­pos­ite In­dex jumped 2.34 per cent, with main­land stocks helped by a cash in­jec­tion into fi­nan­cial mar­kets by the Chi­nese cen­tral bank.</p>
