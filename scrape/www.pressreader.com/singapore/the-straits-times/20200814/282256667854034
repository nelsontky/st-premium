    <p>DE­LIV­ERS KEY AS­SIST IN PARIS’ LATE WIN</p>
    <p>Choupo-Mot­ing’s stop­page-time strike sends them into sec­ond Cham­pi­ons League s-fi­nal</p>
    <p>LIS­BON • Paris Saint-Ger­main coach Thomas Tuchel let out a scream of joy and relief at the full­time whis­tle on Wed­nes­day.</p>
    <p>It was both a sense of ex­hil­a­ra­tion and relief for the Ger­man, who de­spite lead­ing the French gi­ants to a do­mes­tic tre­ble, was fac­ing the axe had the club not pro­gressed past Serie A side and Cham­pi­ons League debu­tants Ata­lanta.</p>
    <p>Since the Qatari takeover in 2011, PSG have had four coaches, in­clud­ing Tuchel, and a fifth one looked to be on the cards as the clock sig­nalled the 90th minute.</p>
    <p>Ata­lanta, against all odds, were lead­ing 1-0 cour­tesy of Mario</p>
    <p>Pasalic’s 27th-minute opener and fended off waves and waves of at­tacks by the Ligue 1 side.</p>
    <p>PSG looked primed to fail on the big­gest stage again and this time, against a side whose net spend since 2002 is still less than the com­bined €402 mil­lion (S$652 mil­lion) out­lay on Ney­mar and Kylian Mbappe.</p>
    <p>But as the fi­nal minute ticked down, Mar­quin­hos fired home via a de­flec­tion off Mat­tia Cal­dara.</p>
    <p>With the re­sis­tance bro­ken, Mbappe then set up fel­low sub­sti­tute Eric Maxim Choupo-Mot­ing for a stop­page-time win­ner, spark­ing wild scenes at the Es­ta­dio da</p>
    <p>Luz as Ata­lanta’s play­ers slumped to the turf.</p>
    <p>The in­ten­sity of Tuchel’s re­ac­tion was in­ten­si­fied by the fact that, with an an­kle in­jury he picked up last week, he had been forced to sit on an ice-box and watch most of the game with his leg strapped in a “moon boot”.</p>
    <p>Oth­er­wise, the 46-year-old would have piled on his play­ers in cel­e­bra­tion as PSG reached the Cham­pi­ons League semi-fi­nals for just the sec­ond time.</p>
    <p>On seal­ing their first ap­pear­ance in the last four since 1995, putting them within a shout of their maiden Euro­pean Cup, Tuchel said: “Imag­ine what I would have done if I had two legs.</p>
    <p>“Maybe to­day would be the day you would see me sprint for 40 me­tres. But it’s the club’s birthday to</p>
    <p>UN­FOR­GET­TABLE</p>
    <p>Maybe to­day would be the day you would see me sprint for 40 me­tres. But it’s the club’s birthday to­day, ex­actly 50 years, so we will not forget this birthday for sure. ’’</p>
    <p>THOMAS TUCHEL, PSG coach, on how he might have cel­e­brated the win if he hadn’t been in­jured.</p>
    <p>day, ex­actly 50 years, so we will not forget this birthday for sure. It was ab­so­lutely de­served.”</p>
    <p>The early cur­tail­ment of the French sea­son in April due to the coro­n­avirus pan­demic left PSG with a lot of time to think and lit­tle ac­tion to pre­pare for the trip to Por­tu­gal – they had played only two com­pet­i­tive games since March prior to fac­ing Ata­lanta – but Tuchel was full of praise for the heart shown by his play­ers.</p>
    <p>He said: “It was very dif­fi­cult to pre­pare the team. There was no rhythm be­cause there were no games, but I could feel in the last days that the de­ter­mi­na­tion, en­thu­si­asm and ef­fort of the group, the qual­ity of the train­ing and the mix be­tween love and hard work, was ex­cep­tional.</p>
    <p>“For me, it was a de­served win, but if you score so late, it was also luck – but I’m the first one to ad­mit you need luck.”</p>
    <p>But luck is also earned and in Mbappe, PSG had a dev­as­tat­ing weapon off the bench and whose sheer pace forced the Ital­ians onto the back foot.</p>
    <p>The France for­ward was rated a se­ri­ous doubt for the game, hav­ing suf­fered an an­kle in­jury in July, but de­spite be­ing only half-fit, his pres­ence in the sec­ond half caused no end of prob­lems.</p>
    <p>Ata­lanta coach Gian Piero Gasperini later called his in­tro­duc­tion “de­ci­sive”, say­ing: “There was not long to go and it seemed we had done it, but when you play against some of the strong­est in the world at a tech­ni­cal and ath­letic level, then it be­comes tough.”</p>
