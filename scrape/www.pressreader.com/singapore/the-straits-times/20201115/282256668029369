    <p>“There is a say­ing in the lo­cal cy­cling com­mu­nity – ‘Can­not ride never mind, must look good!’” jokes Mr Andy Goh, 38, founder of cus­tom bi­cy­cle wheel-build­ing ser­vice, Wheel An­gel.</p>
    <p>While he is able to cus­tomise the aes­thet­ics down to the colour of the hubs, spokes and de­cals to make his cus­tomers look good, he is most con­cerned with build­ing be­spoke wheels that op­ti­mise riding per­for­mance.</p>
    <p>This is be­cause no mat­ter the cy­cling dis­ci­pline, the wheels af­fect many as­pects of riding, such as han­dling and per­for­mance.</p>
    <p>“One may have an av­er­age qual­ity bi­cy­cle frame, but if fit­ted with a fairly good wheel set, over­all, it will of­fer a good riding per­for­mance,” he says.</p>
    <p>“Com­par­a­tively, an ex­pen­sive pre­mium bi­cy­cle frame, when fit­ted with an in­fe­rior wheel set, will per­form poorly.”</p>
    <p>Open since 2015, Wheel An­gel caters to ev­ery­one from rid­ers us­ing bi­cy­cles for com­mut­ing, to week­end war­riors and com­pet­i­tive rid­ers like triath­letes. Most of his cus­tomers are “road­ies” or road bik­ers.</p>
    <p>He takes pride in the fact that his wheel sets are high-pre­ci­sion and hand-built, as com­pared with offthe-shelf, mass-pro­duced items.</p>
    <p>Named after his wife, An­gel, the shop is lo­cated in a 58 sq m space in Toa Payoh In­dus­trial Park, where he meets clients for con­sul­ta­tions.</p>
    <p>After se­lect­ing a car­bon-fi­bre rim based on the client’s needs, such as riding style, body weight and aes­thetic pref­er­ences, he then se­lects the type of spokes and cuts them to length, based on the rim depth of the wheel and hub size.</p>
    <p>After lac­ing the spokes to the hub and rim, he trans­fers the wheel to a tru­ing stand to ad­just and straighten it, un­til it achieves per­fect “true­ness”.</p>
    <p>After many years of prac­tice, the du­ra­tion of lac­ing and build­ing a pair of wheels takes him slightly less than two hours, com­pared with more than two days when he first picked up the art.</p>
    <p>He learnt his ba­sic wheel-build­ing skills from pi­o­neer­ing wheel brand Soul Bikes, which he joined as an ap­pren­tice at age 28. It was where he met, and was in­spired by, its founder Sean Wai.</p>
    <p>“Back then, Sin­ga­pore’s cy­cling scene was start­ing to pick up and</p>
    <p>Sean was a one-man show,” re­calls Mr Goh. “I’ll never for­get his pa­tience be­cause he never once rushed me and gave me all the time I needed to learn.”</p>
    <p>“Even though the ap­pren­tice­ship lasted just three months, it was enough for me to love the ex­pe­ri­ence and I wanted to ex­plore the art and sci­ence of wheel-build­ing even more,” adds Mr Goh, who worked as a project co­or­di­na­tor at an in­te­rior de­sign firm with his brother un­til 2015, when he left to start Wheel An­gel.</p>
    <p>On the same day he reg­is­tered the business, he struck a small lottery win, just enough to fund his first set of tools.</p>
    <p>Five years on, he is such a sub­ject mat­ter ex­pert that wheel builders from all over the world con­sult him via so­cial me­dia.</p>
    <p>Last year, he also started to de­sign and sell his own brand of bi­cy­cle hubs, called Velotech­nic.</p>
    <p>“I’ve come across many dif­fer­ent types of hubs, but none of them had the strength, stiff­ness, sta­bil­ity and smooth­ness com­bined that I was look­ing for... so it be­came my dream to de­velop a hub with these four at­tributes,” he says.</p>
    <p>The hub is the cen­tral part of a bike’s wheels, which con­nects to the wheel’s rim via the spokes and through which the axle is fit­ted.</p>
    <p>His hubs are now sold in the United States, Brazil, Switzer­land and Ja­pan. “My big­gest dream is to have this lo­cally de­signed hub dis­trib­uted world­wide,” he says. “Hope­fully peo­ple will end up en­joy­ing cy­cling more be­cause of my prod­uct.”</p>

    <p>The sec­ond sea­son of Made In Sin­ga­pore cel­e­brates the en­tre­pre­neur­ial spirit of Sin­ga­pore­ans who de­sign and hand­craft goods, mak­ing a business out of what they love.</p>
