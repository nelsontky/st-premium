    <p>•</p>
    <p>Paris Saint-Ger­main winger An­gel di Maria re­ceived a four-match ban on Wed­nes­day for spit­ting at Mar­seille de­fender Al­varo Gon­za­lez.</p>
    <p>The French cham­pi­ons’ fiery Ligue 1 home clash with Mar­seille al­most a fort­night ago saw five play­ers sent off and claims of racial abuse by Ney­mar .</p>
    <p>The sus­pen­sion was meted out by the league’s dis­ci­plinary com­mis­sion and takes ef­fect from next Tues­day, mean­ing he can play against Reims on Sun­day, be­fore re­turn­ing the week­end of Nov 8.</p>
    <p>Ney­mar’s ac­cu­sa­tion that Gon­za­lez racially abused him will be in­ves­ti­gated next Wed­nes­day, the com­mis­sion an­nounced.</p>
    <p>The Brazil­ian, who was sent off for slap­ping his op­po­nent on the back of the head, has ac­cused the Spa­niard of call­ing him a “mon­key”, which Gon­za­lez has de­nied.</p>
    <p>The world’s most ex­pen­sive player at £198 mil­lion (S$347.3 mil­lion) is serv­ing a two-match ban for that in­ci­dent on Sept 13.</p>
    <p>The fra­cas also led to team­mate</p>
    <p>Layvin Kurzawa in­cur­ring a six­match ban for kick­ing out at Mar­seille’s Jor­dan Amavi, who was hit with a sus­pen­sion of three games af­ter he too was dis­missed.</p>
    <p>PSG mid­fielder Le­an­dro Pare­des was banned for two games af­ter he was sent off for a clash with fel­low</p>
    <p>Ar­gen­tinian Dario Benedetto, who was given his march­ing or­ders.</p>
    <p>The French league’s dis­ci­plinary com­mis­sion is also in­ves­ti­gat­ing ac­cu­sa­tions that Ney­mar made racist re­marks to­wards Mar­seille’s Ja­panese right-back Hiroki Sakai and made a ho­mo­pho­bic slur against Gon­za­lez. Any player found guilty of racist or dis­crim­i­na­tory abuse risks a ban of up to 10 matches.</p>
    <p>There was more dis­ap­point­ment for di Maria on Wed­nes­day as he was left out of the Ar­gentina squad for next month’s World Cup qual­i­fiers against Ecuador and Bo­livia.</p>
    <p>The mid­fielder helped take PSG to the Cham­pi­ons League fi­nal last month and said he could find “no ex­pla­na­tion” for his omis­sion.</p>
    <p>“It is dif­fi­cult to un­der­stand why I’m not se­lected,” he told Ar­gen­tinian ra­dio sta­tion AM 590. Lo­cal pun­dits have sug­gested coach Lionel Scaloni left the 32-year old out as he wants to phase in new play­ers.</p>
