    <p>Sin­ga­pore’s na­tional Covid-19 vac­ci­na­tion pro­gramme kicked off, with the first Pfizer-BioNTech jabs be­ing ad­min­is­tered to 40 health­care work­ers at the Na­tional Cen­tre for In­fec­tious Dis­eases. This marks an im­por­tant mile­stone in the Re­pub­lic’s fight against Covid-19, Health Min­is­ter Gan Kim Yong told re­porters.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore’s na­tional Covid-19 vac­ci­na­tion pro­gramme kicked off yes­ter­day, with the first Pfiz­erBioNTech jabs be­ing ad­min­is­tered to 40 health­care work­ers at the Na­tional Cen­tre for In­fec­tious Dis­eases (NCID).</p>
    <p>This marks an im­por­tant mile­stone in the Re­pub­lic’s fight against Covid-19, Health Min­is­ter Gan Kim Yong told re­porters, not­ing that vac­ci­na­tion could help ac­cel­er­ate the re­sump­tion of eco­nomic as well as other com­mu­nity ac­tiv­i­ties and pave the way for the re­open­ing of more bor­ders.</p>
    <p>“We want to re­as­sure Sin­ga­pore­ans that our pri­or­ity over the next few months is to en­sure that the vac­cines that we use are safe and ef­fec­tive, and that we are able to roll out this pro­gramme to the whole pop­u­la­tion smoothly and in an or­derly man­ner,” said Mr Gan, who co-chairs the multi-min­istry task force tack­ling Covid-19.</p>
    <p>The vac­ci­na­tion ef­forts will also be ramped up over the next few weeks and months, said Mr Gan dur­ing a visit to the NCID, with health­care work­ers in other public health­care in­sti­tu­tions and pri­vate hos­pi­tals next in line to be in­oc­u­lated.</p>
    <p>Sub­se­quently, front-line work­ers and se­niors will be vac­ci­nated, with the doses be­ing pro­gres­sively ex­tended to the rest of the pop­u­la­tion after that. “We aim to com­plete our cov­er­age by the end of next year,” he said.</p>
    <p>Mr Gan added he was glad to see that a ro­bust sys­tem has been put in place to en­sure a smooth roll­out, given the chal­lenges of ad­min­is­ter­ing the Pfizer-BioNTech vac­cines, which were first de­liv­ered to Sin­ga­pore from Brus­sels ear­lier this month.</p>
    <p>The process in­cludes keep­ing the vac­cines at mi­nus 70 deg C in stor­age, and en­sur­ing that they stay at 2 to 8 deg C when they are trans­ferred. They also have to be ad­min­is­tered within a spe­cific time­frame.</p>
    <p>That is why the roll-out of the vac­cine is be­ing done slowly and with cau­tion, rather than “rush­ing into it and (rolling) out en masse”, which could pose a mul­ti­tude of dif­fi­cul­ties and chal­lenges, said Mr Gan.</p>
    <p>In a Face­book post yes­ter­day, Prime Min­is­ter Lee Hsien Loong hailed the roll-out of the vac­cine as a new chap­ter in Sin­ga­pore’s fight against the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>“The vac­cine is key to liv­ing in a Covid-19 world, but it will still be some time be­fore this storm will pass. Mean­while, let’s stay vig­i­lant to keep our­selves and our loved ones healthy and safe,” he wrote.</p>
    <p>Mr Gan also re­minded Sin­ga­pore­ans to stay on their guard against the virus.</p>
    <p>Though com­mu­nity cases re­main low, “the next outbreak is just one in­fec­tion away”, he said, adding that a high vac­ci­na­tion rate can pro­tect the coun­try from fu­ture waves of in­fec­tion.</p>
    <p>Said Mr Gan: “We need to con­tinue to re­main vig­i­lant and when the op­por­tu­nity comes for us, we must step for­ward to get vac­ci­nated to pro­tect our­selves, pro­tect one an­other and to keep Sin­ga­pore safe.”</p>
    <p>Ms Sarah Lim, 46, a se­nior staff nurse at the NCID, was the first per­son in Sin­ga­pore to re­ceive the vac­cine.</p>
    <p>“I feel grate­ful and thank­ful for be­ing the first to be vac­ci­nated. I would en­cour­age (oth­ers) to go for it,” she told re­porters after re­ceiv­ing the shot.</p>
    <p>To­day also marks a year since China alerted the world to the outbreak of the coro­n­avirus, which has since in­fected 82 mil­lion peo­ple world­wide and claimed the lives of about 1.8 mil­lion peo­ple. There were 27 new coro­n­avirus cases con­firmed in Sin­ga­pore yes­ter­day, tak­ing the coun­try’s to­tal to 58,569.</p>
    <p>STORM HAS NOT PASSED</p>
    <p>The vac­cine is key to liv­ing in a Covid-19 world, but it will still be some time be­fore this storm will pass. Mean­while, let’s stay vig­i­lant to keep our­selves and our loved ones healthy and safe.</p>
    <p>PRIME MIN­IS­TER LEE HSIEN LOONG, in a Face­book post.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore­ans should pro­tect them­selves from Covid-19 by get­ting vac­ci­nated, even if the num­ber of com­mu­nity cases is low, as the next outbreak could be “just one in­fec­tion away”, said Health Min­is­ter Gan Kim Yong yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Urg­ing cit­i­zens not to be com­pla­cent that the virus is not widely cir­cu­lat­ing and to take the vac­cine when it be­comes avail­able to them, he said: “We must al­ways be pre­pared that there will be new waves of in­fec­tion.”</p>
    <p>Hav­ing a pop­u­la­tion that is ex­ten­sively in­oc­u­lated would help the coun­try guard against new waves of in­fec­tions, Mr Gan said.</p>
    <p>“(It will also) al­low us to con­tinue to progress to­wards re­turn­ing to nor­malcy in our com­mu­nity and our econ­omy,” he said.</p>
    <p>At the same time, it would pave the way for Sin­ga­pore to re­open its travel routes.</p>
    <p>“In­ter­na­tional travel has al­most ground to a halt be­cause of... bor­der con­trols and with vac­ci­na­tion,</p>
    <p>it will al­low many of these travel routes to be re­con­nected, and to al­low Sin­ga­pore to be re­con­nected back to the rest of the world,” noted Mr Gan, who co-chairs the multi-min­istry task force tack­ling Covid-19.</p>
    <p>He was speak­ing to re­porters at the Na­tional Cen­tre for In­fec­tious Dis­eases, where Sin­ga­pore’s Covid-19 vac­ci­na­tion ex­er­cise kicked off, with the first Pfiz­erBioNTech jabs ad­min­is­tered to health­care work­ers there. Other health­care work­ers will be vac­ci­nated in the com­ing weeks.</p>
    <p>Asked about con­cerns over the safety of the vac­cine, Mr Gan said it has met the re­quire­ments of the World Health Or­gan­i­sa­tion, the Health Sciences Author­ity and other reg­u­la­tory agen­cies.</p>
    <p>He ac­knowl­edged that the longterm ef­fects of the vac­cine re­main un­known, given that the vac­cine has been avail­able only for a few months.</p>
    <p>“We are con­tin­u­ing to ob­serve and con­tin­u­ing to mon­i­tor the data that is emerg­ing... there are pre­cau­tions that are put in place, and the vac­cines have met all the safety</p>
    <p>and ef­fi­cacy re­quire­ments for it to be de­ployed,” he added.</p>
    <p>Any po­ten­tial risk of re­ceiv­ing the vac­cine also has to be weighed against the po­ten­tial of a per­son get­ting Covid-19 and fall­ing se­verely ill, he said, not­ing that an ex­pert com­mit­tee has rec­om­mended that all Sin­ga­pore­ans who are med­i­cally el­i­gi­ble should be vac­ci­nated.</p>
    <p>Asked if travel re­stric­tions to coun­tries like Malaysia could be re­laxed for res­i­dents who have been vac­ci­nated, Mr Gan said this de­pends on mul­ti­ple fac­tors be­yond</p>
    <p>vac­ci­na­tion alone.</p>
    <p>“It also de­pends on... safe man­age­ment mea­sures in the des­ti­na­tion coun­tries, and whether or not there (are) suf­fi­cient safe­guards,” he said, not­ing that Sin­ga­pore has mul­ti­ple lines of de­fence against the virus. This in­cludes an ag­gres­sive test­ing strat­egy as well as ex­ten­sive con­tact trac­ing pro­ce­dures.</p>
    <p>“Vac­ci­na­tion alone will not al­low you to just sim­ply open up and for­get about all the other safe dis­tanc­ing mea­sures,” he said.</p>
    <p>“(When) the whole of Sin­ga­pore</p>
    <p>It also de­pends on... safe man­age­ment mea­sures in the des­ti­na­tion coun­tries, and whether or not there (are) suf­fi­cient safe­guards... Vac­ci­na­tion alone will not al­low you to just sim­ply open up and for­get about all the other safe dis­tanc­ing mea­sures... (When) the whole of Sin­ga­pore is vac­ci­nated (and) you have a sig­nif­i­cant pro­tec­tion against in­fec­tion, we’ll be able to open up sig­nif­i­cantly after that.</p>
    <p>HEALTH MIN­IS­TER GAN KIM YONG, when asked if travel re­stric­tions to coun­tries like Malaysia could be re­laxed for res­i­dents who have been vac­ci­nated.</p>
    <p>is vac­ci­nated (and) you have a sig­nif­i­cant pro­tec­tion against in­fec­tion, we’ll be able to open up sig­nif­i­cantly after that.”</p>
    <p>Mr Gan added that mem­bers of the Cabi­net, in­clud­ing Prime Min­is­ter Lee Hsien Loong and him­self, will also get vac­ci­nated.</p>
    <p>The sched­ules for that are cur­rently be­ing worked out, with pri­or­ity go­ing to health­care work­ers, he said. “When my turn comes, I will sim­i­larly be among the first to step for­ward.”</p>
