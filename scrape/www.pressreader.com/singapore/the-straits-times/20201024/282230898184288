    <p>Un­paid in­for­mal care­givers of older adults not only pay the lion’s share of the men­tal, emo­tional, so­cial and fi­nan­cial costs of care, they also pay non-triv­ial op­por­tu­nity costs as­so­ci­ated with care pro­vi­sion: lost wages, de­sired life­styles, per­sonal free­dom and as­pi­ra­tions (Care­givers need to seek sup­port to avoid burnout: Ex­perts, Oct 19).</p>
    <p>From a macroe­co­nomic per­spec­tive, the costs and op­por­tu­nity costs of un­paid in­for­mal care­giv­ing are also sub­stan­tial.</p>
    <p>In Sin­ga­pore, the num­ber of reg­u­lar care­givers was es­ti­mated to be over 210,000. While the to­tal value of in­for­mal care­giv­ing in Sin­ga­pore is un­avail­able, the Min­istry of Man­power’s 2017 Com­pre­hen­sive Labour Force Sur­vey shows that about 12,500 res­i­dent care­givers cited care­giv­ing to fam­i­lies or rel­a­tives as the main rea­son for leav­ing their job and not look­ing for a job from 2015 to 2017.</p>
    <p>Think-tank Ur­ban In­sti­tute high­lighted that in the US, the eco­nomic cost of un­paid care­giv­ing con­tri­bu­tions was es­ti­mated to be US$67 bil­lion (S$90 bil­lion) last year, which by 2050, will likely dou­ble to US$132 bil­lion to US$147 bil­lion. Av­er­age op­por­tu­nity cost per care­giver will likely in­crease by 8 per cent to 20 per cent.</p>
    <p>Sadly, well-in­ten­tioned public ed­u­ca­tion mes­sages that re­mind care­givers to seek help of­ten also carry this sub­tle, un­der­ly­ing and in­ad­ver­tently un­em­pa­thetic mes­sage to our un­sung he­roes: The per­son re­spon­si­ble for the care of your loved one and you, is you.</p>
    <p>To nur­ture an in­clu­sive so­ci­ety with rapidly grow­ing num­bers of older per­sons and in­for­mal care­givers, could we move from fi­nan­cial sup­port to fi­nan­cial com­pen­sa­tion and recog­ni­tion of care­givers? For in­stance, a care­giver al­lowance com­pen­sates for the re­duced em­ploy­ment in­come and pays for out-of-pocket care­giv­ing ex­penses. Or how about a cash in­cen­tive held by dis­abled older per­sons that could be used by this per­son to sup­port or even hire fam­ily mem­bers to pro­vide in­for­mal care?</p>
    <p>Such mea­sures pro­mote the in­de­pen­dence of the older adults and fa­cil­i­tate age­ing in place. They recog­nise the costs and op­por­tu­nity costs paid by care­givers and send a strong sig­nal that care­givers play an im­por­tant so­cial-eco­nomic role.</p>
    <p>On a macroe­co­nomic level, such mea­sures are jus­ti­fi­able trans­fers from the na­tional eco­nomic sav­ings to in­for­mal care­givers who con­trib­uted to th­ese sav­ings.</p>
    <p>I hope the rel­e­vant min­istries would con­sider th­ese sug­ges­tions. Wayne Free­man Chong (Dr)</p>
