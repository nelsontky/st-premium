    <p>A next-gen­er­a­tion, pan­demic-ready Repub­lic of Sin­ga­pore Air Force (RSAF) med­i­cal cen­tre, with ded­i­cated iso­la­tion rooms and an out­door swab­bing area, of­fi­cially opened yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The Ten­gah Air Base med­i­cal cen­tre is also tri­alling new tech­nolo­gies, in­clud­ing telemedici­ne and self-ser­vice lock­ers for dis­pens­ing medicine, al­low­ing un­well ser­vice­men to re­ceive treat­ment with­out be­ing ex­posed to oth­ers.</p>
    <p>If suc­cess­ful, these could be rolled out to other Sin­ga­pore Armed Forces (SAF) med­i­cal cen­tres in the fu­ture.</p>
    <p>Se­nior Min­is­ter of State for De­fence Heng Chee How, who of­fi­ci­ated at the open­ing cer­e­mony, said the cen­tre in­cor­po­rates lessons learnt from past pan­demics, such as the se­vere acute res­pi­ra­tory syn­drome and H1N1.</p>
    <p>“As this was built, it so hap­pened that the whole world got hit by Covid-19, so it came in very handy. As a re­sult, they could test out the dif­fer­ent con­cepts and de­signs, and also fur­ther in­no­vate the meth­ods, tak­ing into ac­count the re­quire­ments of Covid-19.”</p>
    <p>Med­i­cal ser­vices are crit­i­cal in re­duc­ing down­time, so that ev­ery soldier can be fight­ing fit for as long as pos­si­ble, said Mr Heng.</p>
    <p>“A cen­tre such as this, be­cause of the way it is de­signed and equipped and per­son­nel-trained, greatly en­hances our con­fi­dence and our abil­ity to take good care of our per­son­nel,” he said.</p>
    <p>Also at the open­ing cer­e­mony were the Chief of Air Force, Ma­jor-Gen­eral Kelvin Khong; Com­man­der of the Air Power Gen­er­a­tion Com­mand, Bri­gadier-Gen­eral Ho Yung Peng; Chief Air Force Med­i­cal Of­fi­cer, Colonel (Dr) Ben­jamin Tan; and other se­nior of­fi­cers from the RSAF.</p>
    <p>Ten­gah Air Base hosts the RSAF’s fixed-wing and fighter jet op­er­a­tions.</p>
    <p>The med­i­cal cen­tre, which was con­cep­tu­alised in 2015, pro­vides pri­mary healthcare for ser­vice­men at the air­base, as well as emer­gency re­sponse for those train­ing in the sur­round­ing ar­eas.</p>
    <p>Op­er­at­ing since Fe­bru­ary, it is the first pan­demic-ready SAF med­i­cal cen­tre. Fea­tures in­clude a shel­tered drive­way to cater for drive-through swabs and four iso­la­tion rooms for those sus­pected of be­ing in­fected.</p>
    <p>Medics are trained to per­form swab op­er­a­tions.</p>
    <p>Other ini­tia­tives be­ing tri­alled in­clude a dig­i­tal queue man­age­ment sys­tem, where ser­vice­men can book ap­point­ments re­motely.</p>
    <p>Another in­volves telemedici­ne, which al­lows a ser­vice­man to con­sult an SAF doc­tor via an ap­proved video­con­fer­enc­ing plat­form.</p>
    <p>Us­ing video an­a­lyt­ics and ar­ti­fi­cial in­tel­li­gence, a non-in­va­sive method of mea­sur­ing a ser­vice­man’s vi­tal signs, such as heart rate and oxy­gen sat­u­ra­tion, is also be­ing tested.</p>
    <p>Col (Dr) Tan said in­no­va­tions be­ing tested at the cen­tre could be im­ple­mented at other med­i­cal cen­tres across the SAF.</p>
    <p>He added: “As of now, a lot of these are still in the trial stages. So we need to eval­u­ate, con­tinue to trou­bleshoot and re­fine the pro­cesses so that... it’s easy scal­ing up.”</p>
    <p>Cap­tain (NS) Ke­val Singh Mann, 33, an op­er­a­tionally ready na­tional ser­vice­man, said that telemedici­ne could be use­ful for med­i­cal re­views after a ser­vice­man re­ports sick.</p>
    <p>“Be­ing able to pos­si­bly do this via telemedici­ne is re­ally good, be­cause we don’t have to queue at the med­i­cal cen­tre and the unit can also bet­ter utilise our time,” added the air war­fare of­fi­cer.</p>
