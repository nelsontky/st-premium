    <p>First ap­ply for a Build-To-Or­der (BTO) flat, then have a wed­ding three to four years later.</p>
    <p>Such is the plan – one might even call it a tem­plate – for so many young Sin­ga­porean cou­ples that the prag­ma­tism has passed into ur­ban leg­end here.</p>
    <p>But in a time of Covid-19, the “BTO first, mar­riage later” path in life has come un­der strain.</p>
    <p>In the Au­gust sales ex­er­cise of th­ese flats, which are avail­able to Sin­ga­pore­ans who do not own any other prop­erty, the ex­pected com­ple­tion date of some BTO projects was pushed back to four to five years, in­stead of the usual three to four.</p>
    <p>For con­tent cre­ator Char­lotte Wang, 27, and her boyfriend of two years, Mr Matthew Lee, the longer wait for a BTO flat means they would have to ei­ther live with their par­ents or rent a flat – nei­ther of which ap­peals to them.</p>
    <p>On top of that, Ms Wang quit her role at a mar­ket­ing agency at the be­gin­ning of the year to take a two-month break, which then turned into a pe­riod of ex­tended un­em­ploy­ment when she could not find a new job.</p>
    <p>Mr Lee, also 27, who works as a fi­nan­cial con­sul­tant, saw his in­come dip as well.</p>
    <p>The cou­ple are now for­sak­ing their BTO plans and think­ing of buy­ing a re­sale flat next year.</p>
    <p>Says Ms Wang: “The pan­demic made things a lit­tle un­cer­tain for us fi­nan­cially. So we agreed we would save up for a year and, hope­fully, by the end of next year, we will be able to af­ford a re­sale flat and a small wed­ding.”</p>
    <p>Their tar­get is to save $100,000. “My own spend­ing has gone down sig­nif­i­cantly as I’m fix­ated on sav­ing up for big­ger things such as the house,” she says, not­ing that she now puts aside about 75 per cent of her in­come, com­pared with 50 per cent in the past.</p>
    <p>Sev­eral other young Sin­ga­pore­ans in­ter­viewed by The Straits Times ex­pressed sim­i­lar con­cerns about the long wait­ing time for a flat, as well as their abil­ity to pay for one.</p>
    <p>Ms Chris­tine Sun, head of re­search and con­sul­tancy at real es­tate agency OrangeTee & Tie, says the re­luc­tance to wait – for those who can af­ford it – could have fu­elled the re­cent spike in de­mand for re­sale flats.</p>
    <p>She adds: “Many BTO launches were also heav­ily over­sub­scribed, and un­suc­cess­ful can­di­dates may have bought re­sale flats as an al­ter­na­tive.”</p>
    <p>Data from the Hous­ing Board (HDB) showed a to­tal of 7,787</p>
    <p>HDB re­sale flats were sold in the third quar­ter of this year, com­pared with 3,426 in the sec­ond quar­ter. This is a 127.3 per cent quar­ter-on-quar­ter in­crease.</p>
    <p>Prices of HDB re­sale flats also rose by 1.5 per cent across the board in the third quar­ter, com­pared with the pre­vi­ous quar­ter.</p>
    <p>Dr Sing Tien Foo, di­rec­tor of the In­sti­tute of Real Es­tate and Ur­ban Stud­ies at the Na­tional Univer­sity of Sin­ga­pore (NUS), says the pan­demic may have led some young peo­ple to re­think their fi­nances and ad­just their spend­ing and sav­ing habits so that they can buy a home.</p>
    <p>This is par­tic­u­larly true if they do not want to wait for a BTO flat and are think­ing of a re­sale flat, which may con­tinue to in­crease in price, he adds.</p>
    <p>Dr Sing notes that there is also the added worry of not be­ing able to find a full-time job with steady Cen­tral Prov­i­dent Fund con­tri­bu­tions, which may af­fect their abil­ity to af­ford the flat.</p>
    <p>Still, ex­perts feel that the de­mand for a BTO flat be­fore mar­riage is a cul­tural norm that is not likely to change any time soon for the ma­jor­ity of young Sin­ga­pore­ans, even i n a post-Covid-19 world.</p>
    <p>But, says As­sis­tant Pro­fes­sor Jeffrey Chan, from the Sin­ga­pore Univer­sity of Tech­nol­ogy and De­sign’s hu­man­i­ties, arts and so­cial sci­ences fac­ulty, they may have to make ad­just­ments and adapt to sit­u­a­tions such as a longer wait­ing time.</p>
    <p>Tem­po­rary ar­range­ments could in­clude tak­ing short-term rental or de­lay­ing mar­riage, says</p>
    <p>Prof Chan.</p>
    <p>A re­cent sur­vey com­mis­sioned by the Na­tional Pop­u­la­tion and Tal­ent Divi­sion and the Min­istry of So­cial and Fam­ily De­vel­op­ment found about 30 per cent of re­spon­dents said they were likely to de­lay mar­riage or have a child later be­cause of the Covid-19 pan­demic and its ef­fects on the econ­omy.</p>
    <p>The sur­vey polled about 4,100 Sin­ga­pore­ans, of whom about half were aged 22 to 32 and in se­ri­ous re­la­tion­ships, while the rest were mar­ried in­di­vid­u­als aged 21 to 45.</p>
    <p>The pan­demic has also caused oth­ers to re­think their cur­rent liv­ing ar­range­ments.</p>
    <p>A week into the cir­cuit breaker in April, 19-year-old Zoey (not her real name) de­cided to start sav­ing up for her long-time goal of mov­ing out of her fam­ily home.</p>
    <p>The ex­pe­ri­ence of be­ing cooped up at home with her par­ents and younger brother in what she de­scribed as an “un­con­ducive liv­ing and study­ing en­vi­ron­ment” spurred the sec­ond-year polytech­nic stu­dent into ac­tion. She cur­rently has a “cou­ple of thou­sands” stored away for fu­ture rent.</p>
    <p>“I had thought about mov­ing out since I was 13 but it was not pos­si­ble, so I stuck it out. But now that I’m older, I can work to­wards this goal by sav­ing more and work­ing part time,” says Zoey, who de­clined to be named for fear of her par­ents find­ing out.</p>
    <p>She ac­knowl­edges that it may be one or two years un­til she can real­is­ti­cally move out, and even then, she may have to “live un­com­fort­ably”, such as in a back­packer hos­tel. But she does not mind.</p>
    <p>How­ever, Ad­junct As­so­ciate Pro­fes­sor Steven Choo, from the de­part­ment of real es­tate in NUS, says many young Sin­ga­pore­ans are typ­i­cally “quite prag­matic” and are un­likely to move out of their par­ents’ house if they do not have the fi­nan­cial ca­pac­ity to sus­tain them­selves in the long term.</p>
    <p>“The last thing you want is to have to move back home when you run out of money. Usu­ally it’s the more en­ter­pris­ing ones who will take the op­por­tu­nity to get out of their homes,” says Prof Choo.</p>
    <p>Zoey says that while she knows some of her peers may en­ter­tain the idea of mov­ing out of their par­ents’ homes, not many will take the prac­ti­cal steps to do so.</p>
    <p>“A lot of my friends are very con­tent liv­ing with their par­ents, so when I tell them I plan to move out soon, they are shocked.</p>
    <p>“I’m go­ing to face dif­fi­cul­ties whether I stay at home or move out, so I choose to move out and face real-world prob­lems in­stead of my par­ents.”</p>
