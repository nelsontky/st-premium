    <p>BEPPE DE VITO, 48</p>
    <p>Restaurate­ur-chef Giuseppe De Vito, who is better known as Beppe, faced the big­gest cri­sis of his ca­reer when restau­rants here were closed for din­ing in dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker from April to June due to the Covid-19 pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Among the five eater­ies un­der his 14-year-old ilLido Group – which in­clude the one-Miche­lin­starred Braci fine-din­ing Ital­ian restaurant – only the more ca­sual Amo of­fered de­liv­ery.</p>
    <p>In­stead of wring­ing his hands in de­spair while his em­pire crum­bled, the Italy-born Sin­ga­porean launched new con­cepts in quick suc­ces­sion to meet the grow­ing de­mand for food take­away and de­liv­ery.</p>
    <p>To­gether with an­other restaurate­ur, Mr Loh Lik Peng from the Un­listed Col­lec­tion group, he ral­lied more than 500 restau­rants to join the #savefnbsg on­line move­ment to draw at­ten­tion to their plight by pre­sent­ing statis­tics on lay-offs and the de­cline in sales, which went vi­ral.</p>
    <p>For these ef­forts, Mr De Vito makes it to this year’s Life Power List.</p>
    <p>Among the first things he did was launch two new de­liv­ery con­cepts in early June. Grammi was a new on­line restaurant that sold homey dishes such as pas­tas and casseroles. The other was Braci a Casa, which of­fered more high-end ver­sions, such as pap­pardelle with white as­para­gus and sum­mer truf­fle, as well as cock­tail kits.</p>
    <p>For Amo, he de­vel­oped DIY pizza and pasta kits ac­com­pa­nied by in­struc­tions and videos ac­cessed through QR codes, spear­head­ing a trend later adopted by other restau­rants.</p>
    <p>He says: “Ideas had to come fast when we had to work with our backs to the wall. We had lit­tle choice but to push for­ward and em­brace take­aways and de­liv­er­ies and new din­ing norms.”</p>
    <p>Af­ter the cir­cuit breaker, when the de­mand for the de­liv­ery of restaurant food ta­pered off, he turned his at­ten­tion to piv­ot­ing his busi­nesses to the re­al­i­ties of the new nor­mal. His rooftop bar Aura at the Na­tional Gallery Sin­ga­pore re­mained shut­tered.</p>
    <p>“Large-for­mat events and wed­dings, which Aura was mainly booked up for, were no longer in the pipe­line. So we moved Art Restaurant from the fifth floor to the sixth-floor rooftop, where the sky­line views of the city can add to the over­all din­ing ex­pe­ri­ence,” he re­counts.</p>
    <p>He also cre­ated a new restaurant to take over the fifth-floor space. Gemma, which opened in Oc­to­ber, spe­cialises in prime meats and large steaks from around the world. It was or­dered to close for 20 days this month for vi­o­lat­ing so­cial dis­tanc­ing mea­sures, and re­opened last Wed­nes­day.</p>
    <p>On the in­ci­dent, Mr De Vito ad­mits: “We could have done better to man­age the in­ter­min­gling of guests and we fully ac­cept the de­ci­sion of the au­thor­i­ties.</p>
    <p>“It was a themed dinner ex­pe­ri­ence with a spe­cial menu that was mar­keted to a mar­ket­ing part­ner’s mem­ber data­base as well as mem­bers of the pub­lic. Un­for­tu­nately, we fell into a grey area where it is not clear whether such a col­lab­o­rat­ing is against reg­u­la­tions. But we will do our best to be a re­spon­si­ble in­dus­try player.”</p>
    <p>He was also ap­proached by chef Mauro Co­la­greco – whose three­Miche­lin-starred restaurant Mi­razur in France was voted No. 1 in last year’s The World’s 50 Best Restau­rants – to open the first over­seas out­let of Carne here in Fe­bru­ary next year. The ham­burger chain was started by Co­la­greco in his home coun­try of Ar­gentina in 2016.</p>
    <p>On lessons learnt from the pan­demic, Mr De Vito says: “It has changed us all as we had to adapt. It has also showed us that we have to stick to­gether and sup­port one an­other more than ever. And that we are more re­silient than we know.</p>
    <p>“We were all forced to slow down and that helped to re­mind us to ap­pre­ci­ate the lit­tle things in life.”</p>
