    <p>• Amer­i­can singer Se­lena Gomez (left) has been cook­ing up a storm dur­ing the coro­n­avirus lock­down.</p>
    <p>The for­mer Dis­ney Chan­nel star is now ready to share her hi­lar­i­ous and some­times em­bar­rass­ing ef­forts with the rest of the world.</p>
    <p>In the new show Se­lena + Chef, fa­mous chefs ap­pear re­motely to teach Gomez to cook dishes rang­ing from omelettes to oc­to­pus.</p>
    <p>The 10-episode un­scripted series gets its de­but on the HBO Max stream­ing plat­form next Thursday.</p>
    <p>It was shot us­ing re­mote cam­eras inside Gomez’s kitchen in her Los An­ge­les area home, where the Lose You To Love Me (2019) singer was stay­ing home with her grand­par­ents and three friends.</p>
    <p>“I thought this would be something light­hearted be­cause I was get­ting def­i­nitely down,” Gomez, 28, told tele­vi­sion re­porters dur­ing a pre­view on Wed­nes­day.</p>
    <p>“This was an op­por­tu­nity to make peo­ple smile. I hope they are go­ing to laugh be­cause I look like a fool,” she said. “I love cook­ing. I just don’t know how to do it all the time.”</p>
    <p>Spills, burns and some­times ined­i­ble dishes emerge as chefs ap­pear on screen from their own kitchens to teach Gomez to tackle pasta, tacos, cook­ies and other meals.</p>
    <p>Top chefs who will ap­pear on the cook­ing show in­clude An­to­nia Lo­faso, Ludo Le­feb­vre and Roy Choi.</p>
    <p>The oc­to­pus did not go so well. “Peo­ple re­ally didn’t like that,” Gomez re­called.</p>
    <p>And the French omelette turned out to be more com­pli­cated than she en­vis­aged.</p>
    <p>“It was dif­fi­cult be­cause I am so used to do­ing it the Amer­i­can way,” said Gomez, whose 185 mil­lion In­sta­gram fol­low­ing is one of the largest in the world.</p>
    <p>She said she has made sev­eral of the dishes again since film­ing ended, but when asked what she was best at whip­ping up fast, she kept to her old favourites.</p>
    <p>“I can kill PB and J,” she said of her peanut but­ter and jelly sand­wiches.</p>
