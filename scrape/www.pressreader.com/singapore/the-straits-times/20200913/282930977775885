    <p>While lo­ca­tion is im­por­tant when it comes to prop­erty in­vest­ment, what you buy mat­ters a lot too.</p>
    <p>For in­stance, if you had bought low-cost prop­er­ties ear­lier, you stand to reap good prof­its now, even dur­ing a pan­demic.</p>
    <p>This is what hap­pened to Ms Au­drey Smith, whose par­ents used to be farm­ers. As she did not want to farm for a liv­ing, she at­tended col­lege to be­come a di­eti­tian.</p>
    <p>For 41 years, she worked her way up the lad­der at Watts Health­care un­til she re­tired nearly three years ago as the di­rec­tor of pre­ven­tive health ser­vices.</p>
    <p>Along the way, she raised a fam­ily, be­came a real es­tate agent and started plan­ning for re­tire­ment in her 30s by in­vest­ing pri­mar­ily in real es­tate, tak­ing a route to build­ing her sav­ings that is some­what off the beaten path.</p>
    <p>In­stead of re­ly­ing on fi­nan­cial ad­vis­ers or Wall Street’s stan­dard fare, some re­tire­ment in­vestors like Ms Smith build their nest egg by cre­at­ing their own in­vest­ment port­fo­lio. Their main rev­enue source may be res­i­den­tial or com­mer­cial real es­tate, busi­nesses or even pre­cious met­als. It is also not un­usual for th­ese in­vestors to hold some mu­tual funds, eq­ui­ties or bonds, but those are sec­ondary.</p>
    <p>Even dur­ing the best of times, in­vest­ing in al­ter­na­tive hold­ings of­ten re­quires grit, stamina and some el­bow grease.</p>
    <p>Still, any­thing can lose value. Lead­ing up to the 2008 fi­nan­cial cri­sis, home own­ers and in­vestors thought prices would never fall, but the mar­ket im­ploded.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing the coro­n­avirus pan­demic, with a vo­latile stock mar­ket and the United States econ­omy in a deep re­ces­sion, peo­ple re­main con­cerned about whether their long­stand­ing in­vest­ment strate­gies and as­sump­tions will see them through.</p>
    <p>Ms Smith, 72, has built a re­tire­ment port­fo­lio that in­cludes seven apart­ment blocks with 15 units that she owns and man­ages.</p>
    <p>About half of th­ese are for low-in­come ten­ants who re­ceive fed­eral hous­ing as­sis­tance.</p>
    <p>This guar­an­tees her some rental in­come and could help mit­i­gate any loss of rent from other ten­ants af­fected by the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>The strength of the hous­ing mar­ket in Los An­ge­les has helped pro­tect her nest egg.</p>
    <p>Over 30 years to March, res­i­den­tial hous­ing prices in Los An­ge­les in­creased 194 per cent, com­pared with 180 per cent na­tion­wide.</p>
    <p>For some savers, re­tire­ment in­vest­ing re­lates to their pas­times.</p>
    <p>Mr Gary Glein, a com­pet­i­tive bowler for much of his life, com­bined his pas­sion for the sport with the op­por­tu­nity to turn around fail­ing busi­nesses: He and his wife, Linda, be­came the largest own­ers of two bowl­ing cen­tres near their home in Wash­ing­ton.</p>
    <p>But since the cou­ple had to shut them down be­cause of the pan­demic, Tower Lanes and Par­adise Lanes have each been los­ing up to US$60,000 (S$82,000) a month.</p>
    <p>“Business in­vest­ments are much more vo­latile” than cer­tifi­cates of de­posit or bonds, said Mr Glein, 76, who re­tired from run­ning his own man­u­fac­tur­ing com­pany in 1998 af­ter sell­ing it to fi­nance fu­ture ac­qui­si­tions.</p>
    <p>“It’s not for the faint of heart.” The cou­ple started in­vest­ing in in­come prop­er­ties in the 1970s, and over the last two decades have di­ver­si­fied their hold­ings with in­vest­ments in the Ta­coma area, in­clud­ing a restau­rant, an of­fice build­ing and a small ma­rina.</p>
    <p>Real es­tate and business in­vest­ments like th­ese make up nearly 42 per cent of the cou­ple’s nest egg.</p>
    <p>To bal­ance their strat­egy, they also hold in­di­vid­ual stocks and in­dex funds, which ac­count for about 25 per cent, and a size­able cash po­si­tion in cer­tifi­cates of de­posits and bonds. Still, the cu­mu­la­tive losses are tak­ing a toll.</p>
    <p>They se­cured three small-business loans to sup­port the bowl­ing cen­tres and the restau­rant. Al­though most of their com­mer­cial ten­ants have paid their rent, some have re­quested rent re­duc­tions, and one has gone out of business.</p>
    <p>Econ­o­mists and in­vest­ment ex­perts said real es­tate in­vest­ment plays an im­por­tant role in any di­ver­si­fied port­fo­lio.</p>
    <p>It “gen­er­ates higher cash flow than the stock mar­ket, be­haves dif­fer­ently than other as­set classes of stocks and bonds, and is one of the few ar­eas of in­vest­ing that are highly tax ef­fi­cient for the in­di­vid­ual in­vestor”, said Mr Dou­glas Abbey, a lec­turer on real es­tate at the Stan­ford Grad­u­ate School of Business.</p>
    <p>His first rule was to buy prop­erty with a “for­ever time hori­zon” that will en­dure be­cause of its lo­ca­tion.</p>
    <p>“Like a good bot­tle of caber­net, you want real es­tate to get bet­ter in 20 years rather than turn to vine­gar,” he added.</p>
    <p>The Gleins said they felt con­fi­dent that their di­verse in­vest­ments and cash hold­ings would see them through the down­turn even though some of their com­mer­cial ten­ants might not sur­vive.</p>
    <p>The cou­ple are still bet­ting that their bowl­ing cen­tres will do well.</p>
    <p>But first, they must en­sure their staff and cus­tomers feel safe enough to go back.</p>
    <p>De­spite the risks, Mrs Glein said, her en­gage­ment with their busi­nesses and the com­mu­nity sur­round­ing th­ese en­ter­prises is like a “chess game” that makes her feel “much more alive and in­volved than many of my other re­tired friends”.</p>
