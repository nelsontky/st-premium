    <p>LOS AN­GE­LES • Brit­ney Spears on Wed­nes­day failed to re­move her fa­ther from con­trol­ling her busi­ness and per­sonal af­fairs after a Los An­ge­les court made no im­me­di­ate changes to her 12-year con­ser­va­tor­ship.</p>
    <p>The pop star, now 38, had asked for her care man­ager to per­ma­nently re­place her fa­ther, Mr Jamie Spears, as her con­ser­va­tor. But the closed-door court hear­ing ex­tended the cur­rent ar­range­ments un­til Fe­bru­ary next year, ac­cord­ing to a court doc­u­ment posted on­line by fans.</p>
    <p>Since her in­fa­mous se­ries of pub­lic melt­downs in 2008, Spears has lived in Cal­i­for­nia ac­cord­ing to a court-ap­proved le­gal guardian­ship largely gov­erned by Mr Spears.</p>
    <p>Many fans have marched and pick­eted on her be­half un­der the slo­gan #FreeBrit­ney, be­liev­ing that the artist – who launched to global fame as a teenager – is send­ing coded mes­sages through her splashy In­sta­gram ac­count beg­ging for help.</p>
    <p>But Spears – known for hits in­clud­ing Toxic and ...Baby One More Time – and her court-ap­pointed lawyer have un­til now made lit­tle ef­fort to al­ter the set-up.</p>
    <p>On Tues­day, her at­tor­ney Sa­muel Ing­ham filed court pa­pers to re­move her fa­ther from the con­ser­va­tor­ship’s charge, in­stead nam­ing her care man­ager Jodi Mont­gomery – a li­censed pro­fes­sional con­ser­va­tor – as its per­ma­nent head.</p>
    <p>Ms Mont­gomery has been tem­po­rar­ily over­see­ing Spears’ af­fairs for nearly a year, as the star’s fa­ther strug­gled with health is­sues.</p>
    <p>“We are now at a point where the con­ser­va­tor­ship must be changed sub­stan­tially in or­der to re­flect the ma­jor changes in her cur­rent life­style and her stated wishes,” Spears’ at­tor­ney wrote in the doc­u­ments filed on Tues­day in Los An­ge­les Su­pe­rior Court.</p>
    <p>He said those changes in­clude her cur­rent de­sire not to tour, hav­ing an­nounced an “in­def­i­nite work hia­tus” in Jan­uary last year.</p>
    <p>At that time, she can­celled her next sched­uled con­cert res­i­dency, say­ing that she was go­ing to fo­cus on her fa­ther’s health.</p>
    <p>Con­ser­va­tor­ships are nor­mally set up to pro­tect the el­derly and peo­ple who are very sick or men­tally dis­abled.</p>
