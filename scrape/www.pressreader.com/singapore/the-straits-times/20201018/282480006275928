    <p>Some things you re­alise only when you are a mum.</p>
    <p>I didn’t know, for in­stance, that go­ing swim­ming would for years en­tail mov­ing in water in a fam­ily pod like por­poises.</p>
    <p>At first, it was be­cause the kids were too young so it was one par­ent watch­ing one child each in the baby pools. Now, even though my 11-year-old son can dive to the bot­tom of a deep pool to fetch bricks, habits ac­quired in the early years of par­ent­ing die hard. Swim­ming lessons were dis­rupted dur­ing Covid-19 for his sis­ter, who is seven, so she still can’t swim prop­erly.</p>
    <p>I am on a solo stay­ca­tion at Fair­mont Sin­ga­pore and do­ing laps in the pool without check­ing on my off­spring is bliss.</p>
    <p>There are more good­ies to come. This one-night “Mum­ca­tion” pack­age, billed as an in­ter­lude for moth­ers to en­joy some cov­eted me-time, is stuffed with pre-par­ent­hood mi­rages: A 90-minute aro­mather­apy mas­sage, high tea where you can in­vite a friend and break­fast in bed. You even get bath prod­ucts from Lush Sin­ga­pore and a set of loungewear from Uniqlo.</p>
    <p>To be hon­est, in the trenches of the tod­dler years, go­ing to the pub­lic loo on your own, without a lit­tle hu­man who needs to pee and can’t work the lock, can feel like me-time.</p>
    <p>The bar is set higher when the chil­dren grow older. Still, for many har­ried par­ents, time-in­ten­sive pam­per­ing is a scarce com­mod­ity.</p>
    <p>Lux­ury self-care in the time of coro­n­avirus turns out to be oddly in­tense.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing my mas­sage at the ho­tel’s Wil­low Stream Spa, a heated towel placed on the soles of my feet sends a surge of toasty warmth up my legs as I take in whiffs of rose­mary es­sen­tial oil with its woody notes.</p>
    <p>The masseuse, hands tightly gloved in plas­tic be­cause of Covid-19, is un­furl­ing all my knot­ted mus­cles.</p>
    <p>I have only had a cou­ple of</p>
    <p>mas­sages since the kids were born and usu­ally just drift off to sleep.</p>
    <p>But my senses are height­ened this time. Per­haps it is a re­ac­tion to how the pan­demic has de­prived us of phys­i­cal con­tact – where hand­shakes are taboo and good friends get smizes in­stead of hugs.</p>
    <p>The stay­ca­tion at Fair­mont Sin­ga­pore, which links di­rectly to Raf­fles City Shop­ping Cen­tre, is a sen­sory fest in other ways too.</p>
    <p>From the pri­vate bal­cony of my room on the 20th storey, I can see the Es­planade, Ma­rina Bay Sands, St An­drew’s Cathe­dral, Na­tional Gallery Sin­ga­pore and even the Mer­lion. It’s like play­ing “Where’s Wally?” with Sin­ga­pore land­marks.</p>
    <p>My so-called “tai-tai life” con­tin­ues with af­ter­noon tea at Anti:dote, a tea lounge at the ho­tel which morphs into a cock­tail bar at night. Try the as­sertive lemon curd with clot­ted cream on scones; straw­berry jam is for plebs. The trout roe on the sal­mon gravlax pops with briny umami.</p>
    <p>The next morn­ing, break­fast in</p>
    <p>bed from Prego, the Ital­ian restau­rant down­stairs, is de­liv­ered. It is a boun­ti­ful of­fer­ing of hash browns, eggs any which way, too many pas­tries, French but­ter and more.</p>
    <p>I’m away from the kids, but the haus­frau within baulks at po­ten­tial crumbs in the sheets.</p>
    <p>Women’s self-care and well­ness of­ten come with a “pink is for girls” ve­neer that I am am­biva­lent about. Yet, it is pre­cisely the per­for­ma­tive as­pect of the scents, sweets and spas cliche that ap­peals.</p>
    <p>Af­ter all, how of­ten do I buy some­thing like a face and body mask? Never, I think, as I slap on Mask of Mag­nam­inty by Lush. I don’t have a rain shower at home. And, hey, I smell like pep­per­mint choco­late.</p>
    <p>HOT TIP</p>
    <p>Try the La Vie En Rose cock­tail ($20) at Anti:dote lounge. The sweet­ness of the peach and rose liqueur is bal­anced by vodka and lemon. Its sub­tle depth of flavour will tempt you to or­der a sec­ond one.</p>
