    <p>WASH­ING­TON • First Lady Me­la­nia Trump of­fered sym­pa­thy for vic­tims of the coro­n­avirus pan­demic and a plea for racial un­der­stand­ing in a Repub­li­can con­ven­tion speech aimed di­rectly at the women vot­ers who have aban­doned US Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump.</p>
    <p>On the con­ven­tion’s sec­ond day, the speech’s warm tone was out of step with a Repub­li­can gath­er­ing that fea­tured harsh rhetoric about Demo­cratic chal­lenger Joe Bi­den and some­times apoc­a­lyp­tic warn­ings about the dan­gers of Demo­cratic gov­er­nance.</p>
    <p>Mrs Trump ac­knowl­edged the pain of the pan­demic in sharp con­trast to most other speak­ers at the party’s na­tional con­ven­tion, no­tably her hus­band, as­sailed by Democrats for his lack of so­lace dur­ing a US health cri­sis that has killed more than 178,000 peo­ple.</p>
    <p>“I want to ac­knowl­edge the fact that since March, our lives have changed dras­ti­cally,” she told a crowd seated in the White House Rose Gar­den, the Pres­i­dent in the front row.</p>
    <p>“My deep­est sym­pa­thy goes out to ev­ery­one who has lost a loved one. And my prayers are with those who are ill or suf­fer­ing. I know many peo­ple are anx­ious and some feel help­less. I want you to know: You’re not alone.”</p>
    <p>With opin­ion polls show­ing Mr Trump shed­ding sup­port among col­lege-ed­u­cated women turned off by his com­bat­ive style, Mrs Trump and other women fea­tured on Tues­day ap­peared to be try­ing to sway the crit­i­cal vot­ing bloc ahead of the Nov 3 pres­i­den­tial elec­tion.</p>
    <p>The United States’ First Lady re­flected on the racial un­rest that has swept the coun­try in the months since the death in May of a black man, Mr George Floyd, un­der the knee of a white po­lice­man in Min­nesota. Protests flared anew this week af­ter an­other black man was shot and left paral­ysed by po­lice in Wis­con­sin.</p>
    <p>“I urge peo­ple to come to­gether in a civil man­ner so we can work and live up to our stan­dard Amer­i­can ideals,” she said. “I also ask peo­ple to stop the vi­o­lence and loot­ing be­ing done in the name of jus­tice and never make as­sump­tions based on the colour of a per­son’s skin.”</p>
    <p>Her re­marks were crit­i­cised by Democrats who ques­tioned the pro­pri­ety of us­ing the pres­i­den­tial res­i­dence for po­lit­i­cal pur­poses.Mr Trump will de­liver his con­ven­tion speech from the White House lawn to­day.</p>
    <p>My deep­est sym­pa­thy goes out to ev­ery­one who has lost a loved one... And my prayers are with those who are ill or suf­fer­ing. I know many peo­ple are anx­ious and some feel help­less. I want you to know: You’re not alone. ’’ US FIRST LADY ME­LA­NIA TRUMP, ac­knowl­edg­ing the im­pact of the coro­n­avirus out­break on Amer­ni­can lives. It was a con­trast to most other speak­ers at the party’s na­tional con­ven­tion.</p>
