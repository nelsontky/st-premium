    <p>BENGALURU • Aus­tralia’s West­pac Bank­ing said yes­ter­day that it will exit oper­a­tions in China and some other Asian markets to fo­cus on its core do­mes­tic and New Zealand busi­nesses, fol­low­ing a re­view of its in­ter­na­tional oper­a­tions.</p>
    <p>The coun­try’s sec­ond-largest lender said it will exit oper­a­tions in Bei­jing, Shang­hai, Hong Kong, Mumbai and Jakarta, and con­sol­i­date its in­ter­na­tional oper­a­tions into branches in Sin­ga­pore, Lon­don and New York.</p>
    <p>The moves are ex­pected to im­pact be­tween 150 and 200 staff, mostly based in Shang­hai and Hong Kong, and will take up to 24 months to com­plete, a per­son fa­mil­iar with the bank’s plans told Reuters.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore is home to West­pac’s re­gional head­quar­ters, at Asia Square Tower 2. The of­fice pro­vides cus­tomised bank­ing ser­vices for in­sti­tu­tional cus­tomers in the re­gion, in­clud­ing in­ter­na­tional trade ser­vices, for­eign ex­change, debt mar­ket so­lu­tions, trans­ac­tion bank­ing, struc­tured fi­nance and com­modi­ties trad­ing.</p>
    <p>Asked if it is hir­ing more staff in Sin­ga­pore, the bank told The Straits Times that tran­si­tion plans are still be­ing fi­nalised.</p>
    <p>“We will re­view fu­ture re­sourc­ing ac­cord­ing to cus­tomer de­mand and needs,” it said.</p>
    <p>It added that all re­gional cus­tomer sup­port and ser­vices will be tran­si­tioned to the Sin­ga­pore of­fice.</p>
    <p>West­pac In­sti­tu­tional Bank act­ing chief ex­ec­u­tive Curt Zu­ber said in a state­ment: “West­pac’s pri­or­ity is to fo­cus on its core Aus­tralian and New Zealand cus­tomers and to sup­port them in ar­eas where we have scale and ca­pa­bil­ity.”</p>
    <p>West­pac said the changes an­nounced yes­ter­day will not af­fect its cash earn­ings and will help im­prove cap­i­tal ef­fi­ciency, in­clud­ing by re­duc­ing its riskweight­ed as­sets by over A$5 bil­lion (S$4.9 bil­lion).</p>
    <p>The move comes at a time when the bank has been hit by steep costs from a money-laun­der­ing scandal and a surge in charges for bad loan pro­vi­sions due to the coro­n­avirus pan­demic, prompt­ing a re­view of its un­der­per­form­ing wealth, pen­sion in­vest­ments and in­sur­ance units ear­lier this year.</p>
