    <p>The Work­ers’ Party (WP) does not have enough MPs in Par­lia­ment to form a shadow Cabi­net, but will or­gan­ise it­self to scru­ti­nise poli­cies in ar­eas im­por­tant to Sin­ga­pore­ans, said WP chief and Leader of the Op­po­si­tion (LO) Pri­tam Singh.</p>
    <p>The WP will also do its best to raise is­sues rul­ing party MPs may not, and of­fer al­ter­na­tive poli­cies – even if it is lim­ited by the re­sources it can muster com­pared with the Govern­ment, he added.</p>
    <p>He mapped out the party’s plans for this term dur­ing the de­bate on the Pres­i­dent’s Ad­dress in Par­lia­ment yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>His speech fo­cused on “cer­tain things that have changed in Sin­ga­pore”, things that must not change and sug­ges­tions on some things that should change. He listed five ar­eas the WP will fo­cus on:</p>
    <p>• Health, age­ing and re­tire­ment</p>
    <p>ad­e­quacy;</p>
    <p>• Jobs, busi­nesses and the</p>
    <p>econ­omy;</p>
    <p>• Ed­u­ca­tion, inequal­ity and the</p>
    <p>cost of liv­ing;</p>
    <p>• Hous­ing, trans­port and</p>
    <p>in­fra­struc­ture; and</p>
    <p>• Na­tional sus­tain­abil­ity, a broad area about how to en­sure Sin­ga­pore con­tin­ues to thrive far into the fu­ture for suc­ces­sive gen­er­a­tions.</p>
    <p>Mr Singh said his ap­point­ment as LO was part of the changes hap­pen­ing in Sin­ga­pore pol­i­tics.</p>
    <p>Prime Min­is­ter Lee Hsien Loong an­nounced the new role af­ter the</p>
    <p>WP won 10 seats in the July 10 polls – in­clud­ing Sengkang, its sec­ond group rep­re­sen­ta­tion con­stituency.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, Mr Singh said the for­mal­is­ing of the LO role has cre­ated ex­pec­ta­tions and there needs to be clar­ity about “what the op­po­si­tion can and can­not do”.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore­ans, he added, ex­pect the WP and the op­po­si­tion in gen­eral to play a con­struc­tive role in Sin­ga­pore pol­i­tics. “It should ad­vance the in­ter­ests of all Sin­ga­pore­ans, whether they may be in the ma­jor­ity or mi­nor­ity on any par­tic­u­lar is­sue, with­out fear or favour,” he said.</p>
    <p>But with just 10 MPs in Par­lia­ment, he said the WP does not have the same re­sources as the Govern­ment and it was im­por­tant for Sin­ga­pore­ans to take this into ac­count.</p>
    <p>As the LO, he will get the funds to hire three more leg­isla­tive as­sis­tants and one more ad­min­is­tra­tive as­sis­tant. All other MPs have one leg­isla­tive as­sis­tant and one sec­re­tar­ial as­sis­tant.</p>
    <p>But Mr Singh, who is an MP for Alju­nied GRC, said the Govern­ment has at its dis­posal 146,000 full-time of­fi­cers in the pub­lic ser­vice, of whom 85,000 are civil ser­vants.</p>
    <p>Given this, the LO’s of­fice “will not have the breadth and depth of the party in govern­ment, in com­ing up with al­ter­na­tive poli­cies”, he said. Nonethe­less, the WP will of­fer mean­ing­ful pol­icy al­ter­na­tives like re­dun­dancy in­sur­ance, he added.</p>
    <p>He also re­it­er­ated his ar­gu­ment that how much the op­po­si­tion can do also de­pends on the quan­tity and qual­ity of in­for­ma­tion the Govern­ment re­leases.</p>
    <p>He said his party in­tended to make tar­geted in­quiries of govern­ment de­part­ments and agen­cies as in­for­ma­tion was es­sen­tial for the craft­ing of al­ter­na­tive poli­cies.</p>
    <p>He also urged the Govern­ment to con­sider how it can put out more in­for­ma­tion with­out be­ing asked, par­tic­u­larly in­for­ma­tion and in­di­ca­tors bench­marked against other coun­tries. Ac­knowl­edg­ing that some data could be sen­si­tive, he said the Govern­ment would have to find new ways of deal­ing with such dif­fi­cult mat­ters.</p>
    <p>Mr Singh also clar­i­fied his role in re­la­tion to the two Progress Sin­ga­pore Party (PSP) Non-Con­stituency MPs Hazel Poa and Leong Mun Wai. Sim­i­lar to other West­min­ster sys­tems, he said he will not rep­re­sent all op­po­si­tion par­ties as the LO, as the PSP has its own prin­ci­ples and ide­ol­ogy, which are dis­tinct from those of the WP.</p>
    <p>He added that he looked for­ward to work­ing with the two NCMPs “where our po­si­tions match and are in the best in­ter­ests of Sin­ga­pore­ans”. He said the WP will set its own stan­dards and chart an in­de­pen­dent course, some­thing that it has done over the years in the face of re­sis­tance even from “many per­son­al­i­ties in the op­po­si­tion camp”.</p>
    <p>The WP’s po­si­tion, he said, is that it owes its loy­alty to the Pres­i­dent, the Repub­lic of Sin­ga­pore and the peo­ple. “We have proven that we do</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore has al­ways been a trad­ing na­tion and open bor­ders are a fact of our lives. In­vestors should know that Sin­ga­pore will never close for busi­ness no mat­ter how many WP MPs are in Par­lia­ment. We make a liv­ing by be­ing rel­e­vant to the world and separately as a trust­wor­thy and re­li­able in­ter­locu­tor.</p>
    <p>Op­po­si­tion pol­i­tics and ad­vo­cacy for Sin­ga­pore­ans can­not ig­nore Sin­ga­pore’s place in the world and what we of­fer to the world. We must still look out­ward, even as we con­tin­u­ally search for a last­ing modus vivendi which ac­com­mo­dates the do­mes­tic pres­sures of be­ing eco­nom­i­cally open, and the re­al­ity of a Sin­ga­pore iden­tity that evolves and crys­tallises as our na­tion ma­tures. not op­pose the Govern­ment for the sake of op­pos­ing,” he added.</p>
    <p>In his 33-minute speech, he also spoke about things in Sin­ga­pore he said must not change, in­clud­ing the na­tion’s his­tor­i­cal po­si­tion as an open trad­ing na­tion, the Govern­ment’s po­si­tion on de­fence and for­eign pol­icy, and val­ues that have be­come syn­ony­mous with Sin­ga­pore, like mul­tira­cial­ism and the cul­ture of ab­hor­ring cor­rup­tion. He pledged the WP’s sup­port for the Govern­ment’s po­si­tion in th­ese ar­eas.</p>
    <p>He also made sug­ges­tions about things that should change. De­scrib­ing Sin­ga­pore as a “glass half-full that can be topped up”, he said: “There is much that is right and which should re­main the same. But there is also much that can and should change.”</p>
    <p>Among his sug­ges­tions was the for­ma­tion of more Se­lect Com­mit­tees to deal with po­ten­tially di­vi­sive is­sues. “This House and the Govern­ment need to re­frame the pub­lic nar­ra­tive on our more press­ing is­sues,” he said.</p>
    <p>Sum­ming up, Mr Singh said: “The WP will seek to play a pos­i­tive role in the na­tional con­ver­sa­tion both in and out of Par­lia­ment to leave be­hind a Sin­ga­pore our chil­dren and fu­ture gen­er­a­tions can be proud of.”</p>
