    <p>Ride-hail­ing firm Grab will start charg­ing a plat­form fee of 30 cents for rides booked through it from next Fri­day. It is the first such move by the firm to ad­just the prices of its ride-hail­ing of­fer­ings af­ter the com­pe­ti­tion watch­dog – the Com­pe­ti­tion and Con­sumer Com­mis­sion of Sin­ga­pore – lifted re­stric­tions on it last month.</p>
    <p>Ride-hail­ing firm Grab will start charg­ing a plat­form fee of 30 cents for rides booked through it from next Fri­day.</p>
    <p>The fee is in­clu­sive of goods and ser­vices tax, and will ap­ply to all Grab rides ex­cept GrabHitch and GrabRe­sponse.</p>
    <p>It is the first such move by the firm to ad­just the prices of its ride­hail­ing of­fer­ings af­ter the com­pe­ti­tion watch­dog – the Com­pe­ti­tion and Con­sumer Com­mis­sion of Sin­ga­pore (CCCS) – lifted re­stric­tions on it last month.</p>
    <p>“The plat­form fee (some­times known as a ser­vice fee) is an in­dus­try-stan­dard fee that many on­line plat­forms such as de­liv­ery ser­vices, ride-hail­ing com­pa­nies and va­ca­tion rental sites im­pose for the us­age of their plat­form/ser­vice,” Grab said on its web­site yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Two-thirds of the fee will be used to im­prove safety and se­cu­rity, among other things, while onethird of the fee will go to­wards ini­tia­tives to sup­port driv­ers, which in­clude ben­e­fits and train­ing al­lowances, it added.</p>
    <p>The fee will be in­cluded in the quoted fare that Grab users see on the plat­form.</p>
    <p>Grab’s main ride-hail­ing ri­val in Sin­ga­pore, Go­jek, had in­tro­duced a plat­form fee of 70 cents in March.</p>
    <p>Grab had in­tro­duced a plat­form fee of 20 cents for its food de­liv­ery ser­vice as well.</p>
    <p>It had been un­able to go ahead with a sim­i­lar fee for its ride-hail­ing ser­vices due to re­stric­tions im­posed by the CCCS in 2018.</p>
    <p>Grab faced ex­ten­sive re­stric­tions af­ter the firm, through its merger with Uber, was found to have in­fringed rules pro­hibit­ing merg­ers that could sig­nif­i­cantly re­duce com­pe­ti­tion in any mar­ket here.</p>
    <p>But the CCCS said last month that it has lifted the re­stric­tions fol­low­ing the in­tro­duc­tion of a new point-to-point trans­port reg­u­la­tory frame­work.</p>
    <p>Grab said the plat­form fee will be the only change that it is mak­ing to its fares for the time be­ing. It added that it is com­mit­ted to main­tain­ing its cur­rent pric­ing struc­ture and poli­cies “for at least the next six months, given the Covid-19 sit­u­a­tion”.</p>
    <p>Gov­ern­ment Par­lia­men­tary Com­mit­tee for Trans­port chair­man Sak­tiandi Su­paat said any ad­di­tional fee im­posed by pri­vate op­er­a­tors in the cur­rent en­vi­ron­ment, no mat­ter how small it is, may not be eas­ily ac­cepted by com­muters.</p>
    <p>He added: “It may be use­ful to see how Grab and other op­er­a­tors for­mu­late this plat­form fee and at what fre­quency.</p>
    <p>“There is al­ways a risk that the fee can be grad­u­ally in­creased over time, given the eco­nomic mar­ket struc­ture in the in­dus­try.”</p>
