    <p>I don’t think the goal was, ‘Let’s show the world the trauma of Mil­dred Ratched so they un­der­stand why she be­haved so hor­ri­bly in One Flew Over The Cuckoo’s Nest.’ But I do think it may shed light on some­thing about in­sti­tu­tion­al­i­sa­tion. ’’</p>
    <p>AC­TRESS SARAH PAUL­SON, on play­ing the sin­is­ter Nurse Ratched char­ac­ter as a prod­uct of the in­sti­tu­tions that trained her</p>
    <p>The Nurse Ratched char­ac­ter from the ac­claimed film One Flew Over The Cuckoo’s Nest (1975) is firmly en­sconced in the pan­theon of great Hol­ly­wood vil­lains.</p>
    <p>And, in Ryan Mur­phy’s new hor­ror se­ries Ratched, she fi­nally gets an ori­gin story.</p>
    <p>The psy­cho­log­i­cal drama, which pre­mieres on Net­flix on Fri­day, stars Mur­phy’s fre­quent col­lab­o­ra­tor Sarah Paul­son as the fa­mously tyran­ni­cal head nurse, lead­ing a cast that in­cludes Sharon Stone, Judy Davis and Cyn­thia Nixon.</p>
    <p>In the movie – adapted from the 1962 novel of the same name – Jack Ni­chol­son plays a crim­i­nal who pleads in­san­ity even though he is per­fectly sane.</p>
    <p>He gets more than he bar­gained for when he ends up in a men­tal asy­lum, where he is at the mercy of the cruel Nurse Ratched, played by Louise Fletcher, who comes to rep­re­sent the op­pres­sive­ness of in­sti­tu­tions.</p>
    <p>But the se­ries in­tro­duces her in the 1940s be­fore she be­came that mon­ster – here, she is a nurse start­ing a new job at a psy­chi­atric hos­pi­tal in Cal­i­for­nia, where some trou­bling ex­per­i­ments on pa­tients are un­der way.</p>
    <p>Speak­ing to The Straits Times over Zoom re­cently, Paul­son says she be­lieves the char­ac­ter in the orig­i­nal film was some­what mis­un­der­stood and that the se­ries may of­fer a new way of think­ing about her.</p>
    <p>“I don’t think the goal was, ‘Let’s show the world the trauma of Mil­dred Ratched so they un­der­stand why she be­haved so hor­ri­bly in One Flew Over The Cuckoo’s Nest.’ But I do think it may shed light on some­thing about in­sti­tu­tion­al­i­sa­tion,” says Paul­son, 45, who won an Emmy for the crime drama The Peo­ple V O.J. Simp­son: Amer­i­can Crime Story (2016).</p>
    <p>The char­ac­ter was very much a prod­uct of the in­sti­tu­tions that trained her, she adds.</p>
    <p>“In the film, Mil­dred is prob­a­bly re­spond­ing to what she has been taught and what she be­lieves is true. And how she be­lieves her pa­tients can best be served is the way she treats them. I don’t think she is pur­pose­fully be­ing cruel.”</p>
    <p>Yet, Paul­son ad­mits the char­ac­ter’s mo­ti­va­tions in both the movie and show are murky at best, and her back­story is a com­pli­cated one.</p>
    <p>“Some­times, it seems as if she is rel­ish­ing her power over her pa­tients, but who’s to say what’s re­ally mo­ti­vat­ing that? I don’t think we re­ally know.</p>
    <p>“And cer­tainly, Mil­dred does many things in this se­ries that are ques­tion­able morally, even though she has her rea­sons.”</p>
    <p>Paul­son says tak­ing on the role was a bit daunt­ing be­cause of how fully Fletcher in­hab­ited the part, for which she won the Best Ac­tress Os­car – one of five Acad­emy</p>
    <p>Awards the movie took home in 1976, along with Best Pic­ture.</p>
    <p>“The enor­mous plus is that I had the great good for­tune of watch­ing one of the most mas­ter­ful per­for­mances in cin­e­matic his­tory,” says Paul­son, whose film cred­its in­clude 12 Years A Slave (2013) and Carol (2015), and who has ap­peared in al­most ev­ery sea­son of Mur­phy’s an­thol­ogy se­ries Amer­i­can Hor­ror Story (2011 to present).</p>
    <p>“It gave me an op­por­tu­nity to have a real spine for the char­ac­ter built in, at least in terms of know­ing where I was go­ing with it.</p>
    <p>“But Louise Fletcher’s per­for­mance is re­ally re­mark­able so – no pres­sure or any­thing – it’s not some­thing one re­ally likes to think about fol­low­ing,” she adds with a laugh.</p>
    <p>It helps that the se­ries builds a lot of her back­ground from scratch.</p>
    <p>“So much of this story pre­dates (the film) and is an imag­ined idea of what Mil­dred’s life might have been be­fore she found her way to that hos­pi­tal,” says Paul­son.</p>
    <p>“It’s both a bless­ing and a curse be­cause I do recog­nise that some peo­ple will be look­ing for Louise Fletcher – but they’re not go­ing to find her. And I don’t want them to be dis­ap­pointed.”</p>
    <p>Paul­son, who is also an ex­ec­u­tive pro­ducer on the se­ries, says the project eas­ily ob­tained the bless­ing and co­op­er­a­tion of the film’s pro­duc­ers, who in­cluded ac­tor Michael Dou­glas.</p>
    <p>“In or­der to get the project made, we did have to get the rights. They sent them the script and all the peo­ple in­volved were very in­ter­ested in sign­ing on right away and so we were able to make it quite quickly.”</p>
    <p>But the ac­tress hopes that Fletcher and other key mem­bers of the cast ap­prove of the show as well. She is cross­ing her fin­gers that Fletcher, now 86, might even agree to ap­pear in the sec­ond sea­son, which has been given the go-ahead.</p>
    <p>She says: “I thought about Louise Fletcher ev­ery day that we were shoot­ing it and I hope that in the com­ing sea­son, there will be some Louise Fletcher.”</p>
