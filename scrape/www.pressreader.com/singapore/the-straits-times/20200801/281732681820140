    <p>A four-star ho­tel in Balestier has emerged as one of the spots most fre­quented by Covid-19 cases in the com­mu­nity, with at least seven vis­its over a pe­riod of 12 days.</p>
    <p>Ra­mada by Wyn­d­ham Sin­ga­pore at Zhong­shan Park first ap­peared on the Min­istry of Health’s list of places vis­ited by Covid-19 pa­tients last Satur­day. The vis­its by some­one with the virus took place be­tween July 12 and July 23, and lasted from about one to three hours.</p>
    <p>The Straits Times vis­ited the ho­tel on Thurs­day af­ter­noon, but did not en­ter as only guests with room book­ings were al­lowed in.</p>
    <p>Some of those al­lowed in had their par­tic­u­lars checked against a database and checked in via SafeEn­try.</p>
    <p>Many of the guests were men in a ma­roon shirt uni­form. When ap­proached, they iden­ti­fied them­selves as Malaysians work­ing for SMRT. Other guests said they were fac­tory work­ers from Malaysia. Both groups said they are at the ho­tel tem­po­rar­ily, due to the Malaysian move­ment con­trol or­der that took ef­fect on March 18.</p>
    <p>When con­tacted, SMRT re­ferred ST to the Min­istry of Health (MOH) for more in­for­ma­tion.</p>
    <p>The ho­tel’s gen­eral man­ager Tony Cousens told ST it was in­formed by MOH on July 24 that a city guest who vis­ited the ho­tel was iden­ti­fied as a pos­i­tive case, and that the ho­tel gave the min­istry the nec­es­sary in­for­ma­tion for con­tact trac­ing.</p>
    <p>He said the ho­tel’s hy­giene and sani­ti­sa­tion mea­sures have been in­spected and that it has been cer­ti­fied as an SG Clean es­tab­lish­ment.</p>
    <p>“Im­me­di­ately, upon learn­ing of the con­firmed case, we have ac­ti­vated pre­cau­tion­ary deep clean­ing in all ar­eas, hall­ways and el­e­va­tors vis­ited by the guest,” he added.</p>
    <p>Over in Sengkang, the Ac­tiveSG Gym at Fern­vale Square was also re­cently iden­ti­fied as one of the places most fre­quented by Covid-19 pa­tients while in­fec­tious. The gym at 51A Sengkang West Av­enue was vis­ited by one pa­tient three times over four days – on July 14, 16 and 17.</p>
    <p>A spokesman for Sport Sin­ga­pore, which man­ages Ac­tiveSG fa­cil­i­ties, said it was no­ti­fied by the au­thor­i­ties on July 20 that a Covid-19 pa­tient had vis­ited the gym thrice, based on SafeEn­try records. The gym was closed for thor­ough dis­in­fec­tion and clean­ing for the next two days and re­opened on July 23.</p>
    <p>The spokesman added that safe man­age­ment mea­sures are in place at Ac­tiveSG fa­cil­i­ties, in­clud­ing a manda­tory on­line book­ing sys­tem, ca­pac­ity lim­its, wip­ing down equip­ment af­ter use, an in­creased clean­ing regime, tem­per­a­ture tak­ing and the use of SafeEn­try. Users also have to put on masks af­ter ex­er­cis­ing and when mov­ing around.</p>
