    <p>Main­board-listed hous­ing op­er­a­tor Cen­tu­rion Corp on Tues­day saw prof­its drop by 10 per cent to $9.13 mil­lion for its sec­ond quar­ter ended June 30, on the back of ad­di­tional costs in­curred to man­age the Covid-19 sit­u­a­tion in for­eign work­ers’ ac­com­mo­da­tion.</p>
    <p>Rev­enue slid 5 per cent to $31.1 mil­lion i n the sec­ond quar­ter, mainly caused by the early lease ter­mi­na­tion al­lowed for stu­dent ac­com­mo­da­tion i n the United King­dom, start­ing from May 1.</p>
    <p>An­other cause of the de­cline was the lower oc­cu­pancy in dwell Vil­lage Mel­bourne City (for­merly known as RMIT Vil­lage) in Aus­tralia, re­sult­ing from move­ment re­stric­tions im­posed to con­tain the spread of Covid-19.</p>
    <p>For the half-year, prof­its rose 16 per cent to $21.01 mil­lion, mostly at­trib­uted to higher con­tri­bu­tions from new prop­er­ties and lower in­ter­est ex­penses.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, rev­enue for t he half-year ticked up 4 per cent to $66.59 mil­lion, on con­tri­bu­tion from the new prop­er­ties such as Westlite Ju­niper i n Sin­ga­pore, dwell Archer House in the UK and dwell East End Ade­laide in Aus­tralia.</p>
    <p>Earn­ings per share for the hal­fyear was 2.5 cents, up from 2.15 cents a year ago.</p>
    <p>No div­i­dend was de­clared this time around, com­pared with one cent pre­vi­ously as the group in­tends to con­serve its cash re­sources in view of the “un­prece­dented eco­nomic con­di­tion and un­cer­tainty amid the Covid-19 pan­demic”.</p>
    <p>Its chief ex­ec­u­tive Kong Chee Min said: “Even as coun­tries start to re­lax pan­demic man­age­ment mea­sures, the full im­pact of Covid-19 on economies and busi­nesses re­mains to be seen. To mit­i­gate an­tic­i­pated busi­ness im­pact from the pan­demic’s knock-on ef­fects on the wider econ­omy, we are fo­cused on strength­en­ing our op­er­at­ing and man­age­ment ca­pa­bil­i­ties and ef­fi­cien­cies while tak­ing steps to con­serve cash.”</p>
    <p>In its out­look for the pur­pose­built stu­dent ac­com­mo­da­tion (PBSA) seg­ment, the group be­lieves the ed­u­ca­tion and stu­dent ac­com­mo­da­tion sec­tor is re­silient, and that pent-up de­mand will drive a fast re­cov­ery for PBSA prop­er­ties once on-cam­pus pro­grammes and travel nor­malise.</p>
    <p>In the pur­pose-built work­ers’ ac­com­mo­da­tion busi­ness, the group said it has been work­ing closely with the Govern­ment and em­ploy­ers to man­age the mi­grant worker res­i­dents through the quar­an­tine and move­ment re­stric­tions pe­riod in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>“In the long term, we re­main con­fi­dent in the fun­da­men­tals of our busi­ness and the re­silience of our strate­gic as­set classes,” added Mr Kong.</p>
