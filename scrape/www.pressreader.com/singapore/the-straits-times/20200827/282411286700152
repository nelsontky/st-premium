    <p>If you were to pick a movie to an­nounce that af­ter three parched months, the Hol­ly­wood spigot is fi­nally turned on, it will be hard to find a more ap­pro­pri­ate one than</p>
    <p>Tenet (PG13, 150 min­utes, opens to­day, ).</p>
    <p>This one has it all: a brand-name film-maker in Christo­pher Nolan, big names in the cast and, most im­por­tantly, big ac­tion.</p>
    <p>In the sci­ence-fic­tion thriller, East Euro­pean arms trader An­drei Sa­tor con­sid­ers buy­ing foot­ball teams, elec­tions or pri­vate is­lands to be old hat. As played by a scar­ily stone-faced Ken­neth Branagh, su­per-vil­lain Sa­tor yearns for a resource only he can af­ford: time.</p>
    <p>Few di­rec­tors are as en­am­oured of a con­cept as Nolan is with time. From early fea­ture Me­mento (2000), a crime thriller that un­folds back­wards; to heist movie In­cep­tion (2010), which deals with how dreams seem to ex­ist out­side of time; to space ad­ven­ture In­ter­stel­lar (2014), which has time’s ar­row sped up or slowed down de­pend­ing on one’s prox­im­ity to a black hole.</p>
    <p>Like so much “hard” sci­ence fic­tion, those sto­ries use a Big Idea to il­lus­trate a hu­man truth – in In­ter­stel­lar and In­cep­tion, it is the yearn­ing of fa­thers to be with their chil­dren.</p>
    <p>In Tenet, the parental urge to re­unite is found in Sa­tor’s wife Kat, played by El­iz­a­beth De­bicki. Her path crosses with that of two mys­te­ri­ous men, Neil (Robert Pat­tin­son) and a name­less op­er­a­tive played by John David Wash­ing­ton.</p>
    <p>As the trailer shows, things are berserk in their world – crashed cars right them­selves and bul­lets are sucked into a gun rather than ex­plode out of it. As one char­ac­ter says, some­one is caus­ing time in­ver­sion to hap­pen – it is not chang­ing speed, but di­rec­tion.</p>
    <p>Say­ing more about the plot would be un­wise, not only be­cause a de­scrip­tion would spoil it, but be­cause I would go be­yond what I know. I watched the film, but I can­not say I un­der­stood it. Put it this way: Imag­ine a song with a stan­dard 4/4 time sig­na­ture. Now over­lay a 3/4 beat and melody over that. Non-mu­si­cians would “get” it con­cep­tu­ally at first lis­ten, but it would take a few more ses­sions to re­lax into the groove and sim­ply en­joy the work.</p>
    <p>One ac­cu­sa­tion made of Nolan is that he makes puz­zle pieces rather than movies. With its palin­dromic struc­ture – like its ti­tle, it can be read in ei­ther di­rec­tion – this is his most am­bi­tious head-scratcher yet.</p>
    <p>It is at least frac­tal in na­ture, with dif­fer­ent plea­sures re­veal­ing them­selves de­pend­ing on the power of mag­ni­fi­ca­tion one uses. At a dis­tance, the idea of time in­ver­sion will oc­ca­sion­ally cre­ate a sat­is­fy­ing men­tal click, while at a mi­cro level, the vis­ual audacity of the ac­tion set­pieces – a raid at the air­port, a mil­i­tary at­tack on an un­der­ground struc­ture, both done largely without com­puter-gen­er­ated ef­fects – make one’s brain buzz with joy.</p>
    <p>The hu­man fac­tor of Nolan’s pre­vi­ous films is miss­ing, how­ever. The aching of a par­ent to be with her child is shown on screen, but not felt by the viewer. De­bicki, Pat­tin­son and Wash­ing­ton are fine ac­tors, but there is a lot go­ing on. This in­cludes the di­a­logue, of which there is plenty, but the au­dio mix, with back­ground noises and mu­sic sound­track in­trud­ing, caused it to be drowned out. This mat­ters only slightly, as it is pos­si­ble to un­der­stand the flow with a bare-bones grasp of the ex­po­si­tion, but the mum­bling can frus­trate.</p>
    <p>If In­ter­stel­lar could be said to have made quan­tum physics hug­gable and In­cep­tion is a bucket of Lego bricks that snap to­gether beau­ti­fully, then Tenet is like a cold but com­plex ar­chi­tec­tural cre­ation. It was de­signed to im­press if one stands at the right dis­tance from it, and, on that score, it suc­ceeds.</p>
    <p>Other films open­ing this week but not re­viewed in­clude su­per­hero ti­tle The New Mu­tants</p>
    <p>(M18, 94 min­utes, opens to­day). The story takes place in the same uni­verse as the Mar­vel Comic’s X-Men film series (2000 to 2019). Maisie Wil­liams, Anya Tay­lor-Joy, Char­lie Heaton, Blu Hunt and Henry Zaga play young per­sons with spe­cial pow­ers who have to sur­vive a spell in a se­cret prison.</p>
