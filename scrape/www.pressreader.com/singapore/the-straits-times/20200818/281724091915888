    <p>The lat­est round of sup­port mea­sures an­nounced by Deputy Prime Min­is­ter Heng Swee Keat is a wel­come shot in the arm for the econ­omy and a recog­ni­tion of feed­back from the ground, in­dus­try play­ers and ob­servers said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>But they noted that the tar­geted ta­per­ing-off of sup­port mea­sures is also a sig­nal to com­pa­nies that they may have to think about trans­form­ing for the longer term.</p>
    <p>Mr Christo­pher Gee, a se­nior re­search fel­low and head of gov­er­nance and econ­omy at the In­sti­tute of Pol­icy Stud­ies, said the mea­sures recog­nise that the eco­nomic shocks from Covid-19 and other dis­rup­tions this year are far from over.</p>
    <p>“There is a ta­per­ing off of the re­lief mea­sures, which is ap­pro­pri­ate given the need to al­lo­cate pub­lic funds wisely and in a more tar­geted way now that there is a bet­ter un­der­stand­ing of which busi­nesses can pivot best to adapt to the post­pan­demic en­vi­ron­ment, and which remain chal­lenged,” he said.</p>
    <p>Mr Gee said he had ear­lier ex­pected a larger pack­age of $15 bil­lion, fol­low­ing the three sup­ple­men­tary Budgets since Fe­bru­ary. Point­ing to the emer­gence of “zom­bie com­pa­nies” that are sur­viv­ing solely on pub­lic funds, he said the smaller $8 bil­lion pack­age may in­di­cate “a de­sire to tran­si­tion away from broad-brush, rel­a­tively high lev­els of re­lief mea­sures that might lock busi­nesses and labour into un­sus­tain­able op­er­at­ing mod­els”.</p>
    <p>Maybank Kim Eng se­nior econ­o­mist Chua Hak Bin said the pack­age was none­the­less “still pretty gen­er­ous”. He pointed out that even with­out tap­ping the re­serves, there is room for fur­ther fis­cal sup­port if eco­nomic con­di­tions take a turn for the worse, given that $13 bil­lion was set aside for the Con­tin­gen­cies Funds in May’s For­ti­tude Bud­get.</p>
    <p>“It’s en­cour­ag­ing that there will still be sup­port for the work­ers them­selves who have been re­trenched or face in­come loss. The Covid-19 Sup­port Grant ex­ten­sion will be help­ful for them... and the Work­fare Spe­cial Payment will also go di­rectly to the pock­ets of low-in­come work­ers,” he said.</p>
    <p>Dr Chua said firms have to ac­cept that the life­line can­not be ex­tended in­def­i­nitely and the Govern­ment is sig­nalling to them that they have to “right-size” their man­power needs. “The econ­omy is past the worst point, so it’s hard to jus­tify the mag­ni­tude in terms of fis­cal sup­port we saw in sec­ond quar­ter,” he added.</p>
    <p>Ob­servers say the tar­geted sup­port for the badly hit avi­a­tion and tourism sec­tors will help them re­tain their ca­pa­bil­i­ties, but they too can­not avoid making ad­just­ments for the long term.</p>
    <p>Mr Mar­tijn Schouten, peo­ple and or­gan­i­sa­tion leader for South-east Asia at pro­fes­sional ser­vices firm PwC, said the move to scale up the tem­po­rary re­de­ploy­ment pro­gramme for the avi­a­tion sec­tor will help work­ers in the short run, but the sec­tor re­quires “a more fun­da­men­tal so­lu­tion to deal with the longer-term ef­fect of Covid-19”.</p>
    <p>“The sec­tor will ac­cel­er­ate au­to­ma­tion and digi­ti­sa­tion ini­tia­tives to fur­ther re­duce di­rect face-to­face in­ter­ac­tion among air­port staff and ground han­dling staff, for ex­am­ple, and min­imise risk of in­fec­tion in do­ing so,” he said.</p>
    <p>“Reskilling work­ers that are cur­rently not be­ing de­ployed or whose roles are be­ing dis­placed to take on jobs in de­mand will help de­velop a more sus­tain­able work­force trans­for­ma­tion across the sec­tor.”</p>
    <p>Mr Ong Hwee Liang, chair­man of the Na­tional Trades Union Congress Aero­space and Avi­a­tion Clus­ter, said the 4,000 new jobs in the health­care sec­tor and other ar­eas of need un­der the re­de­ploy­ment pro­gramme are of par­tic­u­lar in­ter­est to the unions un­der his clus­ter. “Many work­ers have al­ready been re­de­ployed, and the scal­ing-up... will help even more work­ers find al­ter­na­tive em­ploy­ment dur­ing this dif­fi­cult time,” he said.</p>
    <p>Mr Has­san Ab­dul­lah, pres­i­dent of the At­trac­tions, Re­sorts and En­ter­tain­ment Union, said the mea­sures in gen­eral come as a “huge and wel­come re­lief” for the tourism sec­tor - in terms of sav­ing jobs and keep­ing the in­dus­try alive.</p>
    <p>In­dus­try groups said they were glad their views had been taken on board.The Sin­ga­pore Busi­ness Fed­er­a­tion (SBF) said the ex­ten­sion of the Jobs Sup­port Scheme “pro­vides some cer­tainty for com­pa­nies and di­rectly ad­dresses their top con­cern on man­ag­ing man­power”.</p>
    <p>Added SBF chair­man Lim Ming Yan: “Busi­nesses must con­tinue to be nim­ble and rein­vent them­selves, piv­ot­ing into new ar­eas of growth, such as in dig­i­tal­i­sa­tion, ad­vance man­u­fac­tur­ing, pro­to­typ­ing, fintech, food and agri-tech, as well as lever­ag­ing Asean as a growth re­gion.”</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore Man­u­fac­tur­ing Fed­er­a­tion (SMF) pres­i­dent Dou­glas Foo said the newly an­nounced Jobs Growth In­cen­tive (JGI) to in­cen­tivise firms to hire lo­cal work­ers will be wel­comed by cer­tain in­dus­tries in man­u­fac­tur­ing. “By also pro­vid­ing more sup­port for ma­ture work­ers, the JGI will go some way to­wards re­tain­ing the valuable reser­voir of skills and ex­pe­ri­ence that such work­ers pos­sess,” he said.</p>
    <p>The Sin­ga­pore Chi­nese Chamber of Com­merce and In­dus­try said it will con­tinue to align its ef­forts with govern­ment poli­cies when as­sist­ing trade as­so­ci­a­tions and mem­bers to ac­cel­er­ate their trans­for­ma­tion pro­cesses. Sin­ga­pore Malay Chamber of Com­merce and In­dus­try pres­i­dent Farid Khan said busi­ness own­ers had to take a longert­erm view: “This may in­clude trans­form­ing their busi­ness mod­els and find­ing new ways of work­ing in the new norm.” stores and su­per­mar­kets.</p>
    <p>The same dif­fer­ence would hold in the food and bev­er­age sec­tor be­tween small fam­ily-run restau­rants and big fast-food chains, or in the hos­pi­tal­ity sec­tor be­tween five-star ho­tels, which can of­fer stay­ca­tions, and smaller ho­tels and hos­tels, which can­not.</p>
    <p>It would help if com­pa­nies that do not need ad­di­tional sup­port – such as su­per­mar­kets and e-com­merce gi­ants in the re­tail sec­tor – voluntaril­y forgo their sub­si­dies which can then be re­cy­cled to those com­pa­nies in greater need.</p>
    <p>Nev­er­the­less, while the more tar­geted JSS will go some way to­wards pre­serv­ing sev­eral thou­sand jobs, there will still be re­trench­ments, as well as clo­sures, in many of the sec­tors get­ting help.</p>
    <p>As the Govern­ment has pre­vi­ously ac­knowl­edged, it can­not save ev­ery com­pany or ev­ery job.</p>
    <p>It is there­fore ap­pro­pri­ate that the Covid-19 Sup­port Grant, which pro­vides ben­e­fits to the un­em­ployed, will be ex­tended to the end of the year. But it may need to be ex­tended fur­ther or en­hanced, given that un­em­ploy­ment is still ris­ing and the im­pact of Covid-19 is likely to stretch into next year.</p>
    <p>The Self-Em­ployed Per­son In­come Re­lief Scheme to help self-em­ployed work­ers may also need to be ex­tended af­ter the last payment goes out in Oc­to­ber.</p>
    <p>MORE JOB CRE­ATION</p>
    <p>To cre­ate jobs, a new ini­tia­tive in the Govern­ment’s pack­age is the $1 bil­lion Jobs Growth In­cen­tive (JGI).</p>
    <p>Un­der this scheme, which will last six months, com­pa­nies will get wage sub­si­dies of 25 per cent of salaries – sub­ject to a cap – for new lo­cal hires for one year, and 50 per cent for hires aged 40 and above.</p>
    <p>This scheme will be par­tic­u­larly rel­e­vant for com­pa­nies in ar­eas that are grow­ing.</p>
    <p>How­ever, the num­ber of tak­ers for the scheme and the amount of new jobs cre­ated will de­pend on whether there is suf­fi­cient busi­ness to jus­tify new hir­ings, even with sub­si­dies. If there is, some com­pa­nies might be tempted to out­source at least some of the work over­seas at even cheaper rates – which is now eas­ier to do, given the rise of re­mote work and the pro­lif­er­a­tion of global on­line job plat­forms such as Up­work, Free­lancer and Fiverr that en­able this to be car­ried out.</p>
    <p>The scheme would work best for com­pa­nies where busi­ness is grow­ing and the jobs can be per­formed only lo­cally, as in, for ex­am­ple, man­u­fac­tur­ing, con­struc­tion, ware­house lo­gis­tics and per­sonal ser­vices.</p>
    <p>There would also need to be safe­guards to en­sure that com­pa­nies do not “game” the scheme, for in­stance by re­trench­ing first, and then re­hir­ing to ben­e­fit from the wage sub­si­dies.</p>
    <p>Com­pa­nies that re­trench should not be el­i­gi­ble for the JGI, at least for a min­i­mum pe­riod, such as three months.</p>
    <p>To finance the $8 bil­lion pack­age, Mr Heng in­di­cated that there will be no fur­ther draw­down on the re­serves.</p>
    <p>In­stead, the funds will be drawn from planned devel­op­ment spend­ing on projects that were de­layed be­cause of the out­break.</p>
    <p>This is pru­dent. Draw­ing on the re­serves should be the op­tion of last re­sort, not first re­sort.</p>
    <p>And while the de­layed projects will even­tu­ally need to re­sume, there will, by then, hope­fully be less ex­pen­di­ture on emer­gency sup­port mea­sures as the worst of Covid-19 will be be­hind us.</p>
    <p>But we’re not there yet.</p>
    <p>While the more tar­geted Jobs Sup­port Scheme will go some way to­wards pre­serv­ing sev­eral thou­sand jobs, there will still be re­trench­ments, as well as clo­sures, in many of the sec­tors get­ting help. As the Govern­ment has pre­vi­ously ac­knowl­edged, it can­not save ev­ery com­pany or ev­ery job.</p>
    <p>It is there­fore ap­pro­pri­ate that the Covid-19 Sup­port Grant, which pro­vides ben­e­fits to the un­em­ployed, will be ex­tended to the end of the year.</p>
