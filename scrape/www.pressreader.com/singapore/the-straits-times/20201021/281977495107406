    <p>BEI­JING • Chi­nese-Amer­i­can Ming Dao, a 57-year-old who ar­rived in the United States al­most 30 years ago, is a re­cent con­vert to Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump’s cam­paign.</p>
    <p>Over the past two years, he has started at least 10 so­cial mes­sag­ing groups with names such as “Amer­i­cans for Pres­i­dent Trump” to reach fel­low Chi­nese-Amer­i­can vot­ers. But th­ese groups could dis­ap­pear at any mo­ment: they are all on WeChat, the Chi­nese so­cial app that Mr Trump has threat­ened to ban in the US.</p>
    <p>While most Chi­nese-Amer­i­cans voted for Demo­crat Hil­lary Clin­ton in the 2016 elec­tion, four years later the loud­est voices on WeChat are pro-Trump.</p>
    <p>The par­ti­san blogs on WeChat with the most reach are Repub­li­can lean­ing, ac­cord­ing to re­search by Ms Chi Zhang with Columbia’s Grad­u­ate School of Jour­nal­ism, who de­scribes the plat­form as</p>
    <p>“asym­met­ri­cally po­larised”.</p>
    <p>Chi­nese-Amer­i­cans tend not to be pas­sion­ate about ei­ther party – 85 per cent call them­selves in­de­pen­dent, ac­cord­ing to the Na­tional Asian-Amer­i­can Sur­vey – but a vo­cal, mo­bilised pro-Trump fac­tion has shaped WeChat dis­course.</p>
    <p>The app has about three mil­lion users in the US, mostly first-gen­er­a­tion and re­cent</p>
    <p>Chi­nese im­mi­grants, and has had lit­tle suc­cess be­com­ing more widely used.</p>
    <p>As a re­sult, WeChat’s iso­la­tion from most Amer­i­cans, com­pared with main­stream plat­forms such as Twit­ter, Face­book or What­sApp, has cre­ated a safe space for pro-Trump views “with­out con­cerns about one’s neigh­bours or col­leagues find­ing out”, ac­cord­ing to Ms Christina Wu, from Hof­s­tra Univer­sity in New York.</p>
    <p>Data an­a­lyst Mo Fan in Port­land posts on WeChat with his real name and photo. But on In­sta­gram and TikTok, the short video app that Mr Trump has also tar­geted, he uses an alias. “I’ve seen some ex­am­ples of Trump sup­port­ers post­ing, and left­ist groups find­ing out where they work and putting pres­sure on their em­ployer,” he said.</p>
    <p>Pro-Trump mis­in­for­ma­tion pro­lif­er­ates on WeChat’s US-based blogs, which are easy to reg­is­ter and gen­er­ally serve au­di­ences of fewer than 10,000 read­ers. One first-gen­er­a­tion im­mi­grant in his 60s with an en­gi­neer­ing PhD took hy­drox­y­chloro­quine af­ter read­ing WeChat ar­ti­cles about Mr Trump pro­mot­ing the drug as a rem­edy for coro­n­avirus.</p>
    <p>“WeChat’s of­fi­cial fact-check­ing ini­tia­tives gen­er­ally do not fo­cus on over­seas po­lit­i­cal news,” said NoMelonGro­up, a vol­un­teer group of US-based Chi­nese di­as­pora fact check­ers. At the same time, the group said, po­lit­i­cal dis­in­for­ma­tion on WeChat is boosted by com­mer­cial ac­counts such as study-abroad blogs, which use fear-provoking head­lines to drive clicks, mean­ing it spreads more quickly than fact-check­ing ar­ti­cles.</p>
    <p>Chi­nese-Amer­i­cans back Mr</p>
    <p>Trump for many of the same rea­sons as his other sup­port­ers.</p>
    <p>“US con­ser­va­tive cul­ture is very sim­i­lar to the cul­ture of our fa­thers and grand­par­ents,” said Mr Tian, a 31-year-old en­gi­neer in Mis­souri await­ing his green card who did not want to use his full name. “Peo­ple value fam­ily, pro­mote hard work and op­pose many mod­ern ideas, such as ho­mo­sex­u­al­ity and sex­ual free­dom.”</p>
    <p>Yet Chi­nese-Amer­i­cans dif­fer from the av­er­age Trump voter in their high lev­els of ed­u­ca­tion and salaries. Those at­tributes add to their nar­ra­tive of self-made suc­cess­ful im­mi­grants who do not rely on gov­ern­ment hand­outs.</p>
    <p>As a re­sult, some elite Chi­nese im­mi­grants have joined work­ing-class white Amer­i­cans as un­likely Trump sup­port­ers.</p>
    <p>Af­fir­ma­tive ac­tion has also mo­bilised con­ser­va­tive Chi­nese vot­ers who fear that their high rep­re­sen­ta­tion in ed­u­ca­tional in­sti­tu­tions is at risk.</p>
    <p>Trump ac­tivists on WeChat use the app to keep in touch with friends and fam­ily back in China, but draw a dis­tinc­tion be­tween their love of Chi­nese peo­ple and the Chi­nese gov­ern­ment, which they said was the tar­get of Mr Trump’s poli­cies. Some ac­cept sanc­tions on China as it is in the in­ter­ests of the US. Oth­ers are happy to see Bei­jing bashed, par­tic­u­larly those who came to the US out of dis­il­lu­sion­ment with China.</p>
    <p>One such woman is Ms Wen Hua, who has been door-knock­ing for Mr Trump in her home state of Vir­ginia. Us­ing the US flag as her video-call­ing back­ground, Ms Wen de­scribed how she came to the US with a wave of Hong Kong em­i­grants be­fore the re­gion’s re­turn to Chi­nese rule in 1997.</p>
    <p>“I don’t like nat­u­ralised Chi­nese-Amer­i­cans who try to bring so­cial­ism or com­mu­nism here. They can move back to China,” she said.</p>
    <p>But it is be­com­ing in­creas­ingly dif­fi­cult to or­gan­ise on WeChat, not only be­cause of the loom­ing US ban but also be­cause of Chi­nese cen­sor­ship.</p>
    <p>Sim­ple WeChat fil­ters for sen­si­tive terms such as “democ­racy” can de­tect ar­ti­cles about US pol­i­tics. Some­times when Mr Ming sends ar­ti­cles to his groups, those with Chi­nese-reg­is­tered phone num­bers on their WeChat ac­counts can­not re­ceive the links, no mat­ter where they are in the world.</p>
    <p>Ms Wen, who used WeChat in 2016 to or­gan­ise a door-knock­ing cam­paign for Mr Trump, was glad to shift away from the plat­form this year. “I know it is com­pletely surveilled. Nowa­days I mostly use Tele­gram,” she said, re­fer­ring to the en­crypted mes­sag­ing app.</p>
    <p>If Mr Trump man­ages to pass the WeChat ban, Mr Ming said he would back the Pres­i­dent. “I’ll sup­port it, even though the ban will hurt me,” he said. “In the US, WeChat should obey US laws. If you’re in the US, and they use Chi­nese laws to cen­sor you, that’s not OK.”</p>
