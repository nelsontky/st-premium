    <p>PE­TAL­ING JAYA • The gov­ern­ment yes­ter­day an­nounced that Malaysians who have lost their jobs or are un­able to find jobs will get fur­ther ex­ten­sions to de­fer re­pay­ing their bank loans.</p>
    <p>And those who had salary cuts due to the coron­avirus out­break will be al­lowed to re­pay their bank loans in smaller amounts, de­pend­ing on the sever­ity of the pay cuts, Prime Min­is­ter Muhyid­din Yassin said.</p>
    <p>The ex­ten­sion of the mora­to­rium on bank loans was much an­tic­i­pated by Malaysians, who have been badly af­fected by the out­break.</p>
    <p>The gov­ern­ment in April im­ple­mented a six-month re­pay­ment mora­to­rium to help the fi­nances of Malaysian house­holds. The mora­to­rium was to have ended on Sept 30, be­fore yes­ter­day’s an­nounce­ment of the ex­ten­sion.</p>
    <p>Tan Sri Muyid­din said in­di­vid­u­als who lost their jobs this year and still have not got­ten a new job can en­joy the mora­to­rium for an­other three months, up to Dec 31.</p>
    <p>“Af­ter three months, the mora­to­rium pe­riod can be ex­tended by the banks, de­pend­ing on the in­di­vid­ual’s sit­u­a­tion,” he said in a tele­vised ad­dress yes­ter­day. “For in­di­vid­u­als who are em­ployed but have had their wages cut, their monthly in­stal­ments will be de­creased in tan­dem with their pay cuts.</p>
    <p>“For ex­am­ple, for hous­ing and per­sonal loans, the monthly in­stal­ments will be low­ered in tan­dem with the salary de­crease.</p>
    <p>“This will be for a pe­riod of at least six months and an ex­ten­sion can be given, sub­ject to the in­di­vid­ual’s salary at that time.”</p>
    <p>The pre­mier also said that the banks have com­mit­ted to im­ple­ment sev­eral mea­sures to help bor­row­ers, both in­di­vid­u­als and small and medium-sized en­ter­prises (SMEs).</p>
    <p>He said the mea­sures are ex­pected to ben­e­fit up to three mil­lion in­di­vid­u­als and SMEs.</p>
    <p>The mea­sures in­clude paying only the in­ter­est dur­ing a set time frame, ex­tend­ing the du­ra­tion of the loan to re­duce monthly re­pay­ments, and other forms of re­lief – un­til the bor­row­ers are fi­nan­cially sta­ble.</p>
    <p>“I hope this tar­geted mora­to­rium and bank as­sis­tance ex­ten­sion will be able to ease the bur­den of those af­fected by the Covid-19 eco­nomic fall­out,” he said.</p>
    <p>Mr Muhyid­din said ac­cord­ing to the cen­tral bank, the mora­to­rium has ben­e­fited more than seven mil­lion in­di­vid­u­als, with a total of RM38.3 bil­lion (S$12.4 bil­lion) re­paid up to July 20.</p>
    <p>He added that 243,000 SMEs ben­e­fited from the mora­to­rium, with re­pay­ments worth RM20.7 bil­lion dur­ing the same pe­riod.</p>
    <p>Other coun­tries that have in­tro­duced var­i­ous forms of mora­to­rium in­clude Sin­ga­pore, In­done­sia, the Philip­pines, Thai­land, Bri­tain, Canada, Italy, and the United States.</p>
    <p>Af­ter three months, the mora­to­rium pe­riod can be ex­tended by the banks, de­pend­ing on the in­di­vid­ual’s sit­u­a­tion... For in­di­vid­u­als who are em­ployed but have had their wages cut, their monthly in­stal­ments will be de­creased in tan­dem with their pay cuts. ’’</p>
