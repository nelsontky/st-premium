    <p>Aban­doned rail­way tracks lead­ing into the for­est, seen be­low Cle­menti Road, op­po­site Maju Camp, on</p>
    <p>Oct 21.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore had two sets of rail­ways in the past – one was north­bound to­wards Malaysia, and the other ran west­ward to­wards Jurong.</p>
    <p>The train tracks were once part of the Jurong Rail­way Line, a 14km rail­way that opened in 1965, and ran from Bukit Timah Rail­way Sta­tion to Jurong In­dus­trial Es­tate.</p>
    <p>In the old days, Jurong was made up of jun­gle and man­grove swamps, be­fore it was de­vel­oped into an in­dus­trial es­tate in the early 1960s. It was also the pro­posed lo­ca­tion for Sin­ga­pore’s se­cond port.</p>
    <p>Roads at that time were scarce, and to help speed up the area’s de­vel­op­ment, the Jurong Rail­way Line was con­structed. It was used to carry freight be­tween Malaysia and Jurong.</p>
    <p>How­ever, as Jurong de­vel­oped and the road net­work grew more com­pre­hen­sive, trucks be­came a more con­ve­nient way to trans­port goods.</p>
    <p>After the Ayer Ra­jah Ex­press­way was built in the late 1980s, the rail­way be­came re­dun­dant and it was even­tu­ally closed in the early 1990s.</p>
