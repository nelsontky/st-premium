    <p>Good gov­er­nance, ethics and risk man­age­ment en­able or­gan­i­sa­tions to func­tion and grow, said Mr Ed­win Tong, Min­is­ter for Cul­ture, Com­mu­nity and Youth and Sec­ond Min­is­ter for Law.</p>
    <p>He was ad­dress­ing a vir­tual au­di­ence at yes­ter­day’s launch of a new so­cial en­ter­prise founded un­der the RHT Ra­jan Menon Foun­da­tion, a reg­is­tered char­ity.</p>
    <p>The RHT Grace In­sti­tute aims to up­hold gov­er­nance, risk man­age­ment, anti-money laun­der­ing, com­pli­ance and ethics as five core busi­ness prin­ci­ples.</p>
    <p>Mr Tong said: “These five prin­ci­ples form the back­bone of any healthy or­gan­i­sa­tion.</p>
    <p>“We have seen how the lack of these prin­ci­ples can lead to the demise of seem­ingly large and strong or­gan­i­sa­tions.”</p>
    <p>He cited the En­ron scan­dal in 2001, when the com­pany went bank­rupt ow­ing to ac­count­ing fraud and cor­rup­tion, and the Lehman Brothers col­lapse in 2008 that caused global markets to plum­met.</p>
    <p>“So the im­por­tance of these prin­ci­ples can­not be un­der­es­ti­mated or overem­pha­sised,” he said. “They help to pro­tect in­vest­ments, jobs and lives of peo­ple. They also en­able the or­gan­i­sa­tion to grow.”</p>
    <p>He added that sur­veys have found that in­vestors will pay more for the shares of well-man­aged com­pa­nies.</p>
    <p>“Con­sumers are also more will­ing to buy their prod­ucts and ser­vices if they iden­tify with their ideals, val­ues and prac­tices. Con­versely, com­pa­nies can lose cus­tomers quickly if they dis­play poor eth­i­cal be­hav­iours.”</p>
    <p>He noted that Sin­ga­pore is one of the eas­i­est places to do busi­ness in the world, but it does not mean that it is lax, adding that firms set up shop here be­cause of trust in var­i­ous sys­tems.</p>
    <p>“To main­tain that trust, we do re­quire com­pa­nies in­cor­po­rated in Sin­ga­pore to ad­here to strict reg­u­la­tory com­pli­ance on ar­eas such as gov­er­nance, risk man­age­ment (and) anti-money laun­der­ing.</p>
    <p>“The obli­ga­tions in­crease ac­count­abil­ity and trans­parency and as­sure the in­vestors, share­hold­ers and other com­pa­nies of the pru­den­tial rigour of the com­pany be­fore they de­cide to in­vest in or work to­gether.”</p>
    <p>The new in­sti­tute has de­vel­oped an app so users can con­nect and share ex­pe­ri­ences and best prac­tices.</p>
    <p>Te­masek Foun­da­tion Cares chair­man Richard Mag­nus said at the launch: “Or­gan­i­sa­tions in the 21st cen­tury are ex­posed to dy­namic changes, in­clud­ing geopo­lit­i­cal and pro­tec­tive poli­cies. Cor­po­ra­tions rise and fall based on their val­ues, busi­ness cul­ture and as­so­ci­ated ac­tions.</p>
    <p>“Chang­ing cor­po­rate val­ues, breed­ing a prin­ci­pled en­vi­ron­ment, and adapt­ing cus­tomised train­ing based on or­gan­i­sa­tional need are para­mount for the suc­cess of these or­gan­i­sa­tions.”</p>
