    <p>Bi­jen­dra Man Shakya</p>
    <p>The Kath­mandu Post, Nepal</p>
    <p>The re­cent cre­ation of the RCEP in the Asia-Pa­cific drew much at­ten­tion in the field of eco­nomic in­te­gra­tion as it is set to be­come the world’s largest free trade bloc, out­weigh­ing the Euro­pean Union and the North Amer­i­can Free Trade Agree­ment.</p>
    <p>If this is the lat­est devel­op­ment in eco­nomic re­gion­al­ism in the Asia-Pa­cific, South Asia has fallen be­hind in this re­spect.</p>
    <p>At the 18th South Asian As­so­ci­a­tion for Re­gional Co­op­er­a­tion (Saarc) sum­mit in Kath­mandu in 2014, the lead­ers re­it­er­ated their com­mit­ment to at­tain­ing the goal of eco­nomic union through a free trade area, cus­toms union, com­mon mar­ket and mon­e­tary union.</p>
    <p>But no sig­nif­i­cant progress has been made in this process as re­flected by the stale­mate in the South Asian Free Trade</p>
    <p>Agree­ment that is associated with Saarc.</p>
    <p>The ef­fort to pro­mote South Asian in­tra-re­gional trade, plagued by in­her­ent eco­nomic prob­lems, lacks po­lit­i­cal com­mit­ment from the re­gion’s big coun­tries and ef­fec­tive pres­sure from the smaller ones to re­solve the im­passe.</p>
    <p>The sim­i­lar­ity in com­par­a­tive ad­van­tage dis­cour­ages trade com­ple­men­tar­ity among the coun­tries in the re­gion.</p>
    <p>South Asian coun­tries are less di­ver­gent in terms of re­source en­dow­ment. They are all labour-abun­dant and agro-based economies, and com­pete among them­selves in labour-in­ten­sive prod­ucts and pri­mary com­modi­ties.</p>
    <p>South Asian coun­tries had the core ob­jec­tive of elim­i­nat­ing poverty in the re­gion since the in­cep­tion of Saarc more than three decades ago. This was sup­ple­mented by the idea of a free trade area to at­tain this goal.</p>
    <p>Adding greater im­pe­tus to this am­bi­tion, South Asian coun­tries need to ad­vance to a higher level of eco­nomic in­te­gra­tion, such as a cus­toms union or com­mon mar­ket. These moves lib­er­alise not only trade in goods, but also pro­mote the re­gional flow of cap­i­tal, tech­nol­ogy and hu­man re­sources, in­clud­ing the har­mon­i­sa­tion of tar­iff regimes.</p>
    <p>Con­se­quently, it forms a sin­gle re­gional mar­ket through economies of scale in man­u­fac­tur­ing and in­vest­ment.</p>
    <p>But this is not pos­si­ble with­out break­ing the dead­lock in re­gion­al­ism in South Asia which has ex­isted for the last six years.</p>
