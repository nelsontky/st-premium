    <p>Re­stric­tions on Grab’s ride-hail­ing ser­vice have been lifted, al­low­ing the com­pany to change its pric­ing poli­cies and driver com­mis­sion rates af­ter a two-year freeze.</p>
    <p>The op­er­a­tor is also free to charge an ex­tra fee of about 30 cents for each ride in the com­ing months.</p>
    <p>The Com­pe­ti­tion and Con­sumer Com­mis­sion of Sin­ga­pore (CCCS) had in Septem­ber 2018 im­posed a freeze on Grab’s pric­ing al­go­rithm and driver com­mis­sion rate af­ter the com­pany’s merger with ride­hail­ing ri­val Uber was found to have in­fringed Sec­tion 54 of the Com­pe­ti­tion Act.</p>
    <p>The con­sumer watchdog yes­ter­day said that it lifted re­stric­tions fol­low­ing the in­tro­duc­tion of a new point-to-point trans­port reg­u­la­tory frame­work kick­ing in.</p>
    <p>Grab, in re­sponse to news that re­stric­tions were lifted, said it is com­mit­ted to main­tain­ing its cur­rent pric­ing struc­ture and poli­cies “for at least the next six months, given the Covid-19 sit­u­a­tion”.</p>
    <p>But a new plat­form fee for its trans­port ser­vices will be rolled out later, said Mr An­drew Chan, man­ag­ing di­rec­tor of trans­port for Grab Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>He said this fee will help Grab to im­prove its safety fea­tures, cover op­er­at­ing costs and look af­ter the wel­fare of its driv­ers in a sus­tain­able man­ner. “This in­tro­duc­tion of a plat­form fee will be the only change we will be mak­ing to our fares for the time be­ing,” said Mr Chan. More de­tails about the fee will be an­nounced at a later date.</p>
    <p>He added that Grab will be pru­dent in its pric­ing struc­ture and poli­cies, and of­fer rel­e­vant ser­vices at a com­pet­i­tive price.</p>
    <p>The con­sumer watchdog had im­posed ex­ten­sive re­stric­tions on Grab af­ter it in­fringed rules that pro­hibit mergers that could sig­nif­i­cantly re­duce com­pe­ti­tion in any mar­ket here.</p>
    <p>For ex­am­ple, Grab had to en­sure its driv­ers were free to use any ride-hail­ing plat­form and re­move Grab’s ex­clu­siv­ity ar­range­ments with any taxi fleet in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>The CCCS said in 2018 that the re­stric­tions would be sus­pended if a com­peti­tor to Grab man­ages to se­cure 30 per cent or more of to­tal rides matched in the ride-hail­ing plat­form ser­vice for one month.</p>
    <p>But the CCCS said the start of a new point-to-point trans­port sec­tor reg­u­la­tory f rame­work last month trig­gered the de­ci­sion to lift the re­stric­tions.</p>
    <p>The con­sumer watchdog noted that there are a num­ber of other li­censed ride-hail­ing op­er­a­tors un­der the new frame­work, such as Go­jek and Tada Mo­bil­ity.</p>
    <p>The frame­work also en­sures that all li­censed op­er­a­tors can­not pre­vent their driv­ers from driv­ing for other op­er­a­tors, noted CCCS.</p>
    <p>“The reg­u­la­tory frame­work also en­sures that P2P (point-to-point) fares are trans­par­ent and clearly com­mu­ni­cated to com­muters, while leav­ing fare lev­els to be de­ter­mined by mar­ket forces,” it added.</p>
    <p>“CCCS will con­tinue to work closely with the Land Trans­port Au­thor­ity and Pub­lic Trans­port Coun­cil to en­sure that the P2P sec­tor re­mains open and con­testable,” the con­sumer watchdog said.</p>
    <p>The Na­tional Pri­vate Hire Ve­hi­cles As­so­ci­a­tion (NPHVA) in a Face­book post called for any fare ad­just­ment or com­mis­sion fees levied to be rea­son­able.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, Ms Yeo Wan Ling, di­rec­tor of the Na­tional Trades Union Congress, said the labour move­ment will sup­port NPHVA in its dis­cus­sions with Grab so as to bal­ance the in­ter­ests of com­muters, driv­ers and com­pany.</p>
    <p>“In the long run, we want to en­sure that our driv­ers’ liveli­hood is not un­favourably af­fected by fare ad­just­ments or changes.”</p>
