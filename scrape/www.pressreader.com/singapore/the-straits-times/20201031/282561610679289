    <p>Shares of Nanofilm Tech­nolo­gies In­ter­na­tional surged above their ini­tial pub­lic of­fer­ing (IPO) price in the firm’s main­board de­but yes­ter­day, in Sin­ga­pore’s big­gest non-Reit list­ing in re­cent years.</p>
    <p>The stock closed up 32 cents or 12.4 per cent at $2.91 from its IPO price of $2.59, hav­ing reached as high as $3.02. A mas­sive 106.5 mil­lion shares changed hands, about 16 per cent of the 658.4 mil­lion shares listed.</p>
    <p>Its IPO met with strong de­mand from in­sti­tu­tional and re­tail in­vestors by its close on Wed­nes­day. The Sin­ga­pore pub­lic of­fer to re­tail in­vestors was about 30.6 times sub­scribed, draw­ing 8,678 ap­pli­ca­tions for 118 mil­lion shares for a to­tal of $305.7 mil­lion in ap­pli­ca­tion cash, the com­pany said on Thurs­day. Only 3.9 mil­lion shares are avail­able to the pub­lic.</p>
    <p>The 73.4 mil­lion in­ter­na­tional place­ment shares avail­able to in­vestors out­side the United States drew in­di­ca­tions of in­ter­est for about 1.68 bil­lion shares, mak­ing it about 22.9 times cov­ered.</p>
    <p>The of­fer­ing – pub­lic and place­ment tranches – was 23.3 times sub­scribed by its close on Wed­nes­day, as­sum­ing an over-al­lot­ment op­tion is not ex­er­cised.</p>
    <p>The Sin­ga­pore pub­lic of­fer and in­ter­na­tional place­ment shares at $2.59 apiece came from ex­ist­ing share­hold­ers of the com­pany, Dr Shi Xu, Mr Lee Liang Huang and Dr Wei Hao.</p>
    <p>Separately from the of­fer­ing, 13 cor­ner­stone in­vestors – in­clud­ing Te­masek’s Venezio In­vest­ments, Aberdeen Stan­dard In­vest­ments (Asia), AIA In­vest­ment Man­age­ment and Lion Global In­vestors – have sub­scribed for about 104.3 mil­lion shares worth $270 mil­lion. They rep­re­sent a 15.8 per cent stake in the com­pany af­ter the com­ple­tion of the of­fer­ing as well as the is­suance and sale of the cor­ner­stone shares.</p>
    <p>Some re­tail in­vestors were dis­ap­pointed by the small size of the of­fer avail­able to them. The IPO’s re­tail tranche ac­counted for just 2 per cent of the over­all $470.1 mil­lion raised. Mar­ket ob­servers told The Busi­ness Times the small pub­lic of­fer was war­ranted, given the lack of lo­cal bench­marks to gauge the suc­cess of the IPO.</p>
    <p>The com­pany – which makes ad­vanced ma­te­ri­als and nanoprod­ucts for the con­sumer elec­tron­ics, com­mu­ni­ca­tions and au­to­mo­tive in­dus­tries – will have a mar­ket value of about $1.9 bil­lion.</p>
    <p>Dr Shi, its ex­ec­u­tive chair­man, said: “As the first nan­otech­nol­ogy so­lu­tions provider to list in Sin­ga­pore, this is a strong vote of con­fi­dence for our group and a recog­ni­tion of our es­tab­lished track record and growth plans.”</p>
