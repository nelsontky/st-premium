    <p>LON­DON • Italy have been drawn to face Spain while top-ranked Bel­gium will meet world cham­pi­ons France in the last four of the Na­tions League Fi­nals, Uefa said on Thurs­day.</p>
    <p>The matches will take place next year at the San Siro in Mi­lan on Oct 6 and the Al­lianz Sta­dium in Turin on Oct 7 re­spec­tively. The fi­nal will be in Mi­lan on Oct 10, while the third-place play-off will be on the same day in Turin.</p>
    <p>The Az­zurri, who topped their Na­tions League Group A1, will face Spain for the first time in a ma­jor tour­na­ment since they beat them 2-0 in the last 16 of Euro 2016.</p>
    <p>Their most re­cent meet­ing in a World Cup qual­i­fier saw Spain win 3-0 in Madrid three years ago and La Roja are in form af­ter thrash­ing Ger­many 6-0 in Seville en route to top­ping Group A4.</p>
    <p>Both sides have ush­ered in new blood in the wake of World Cup dis­ap­point­ment – Spain failed to get out of their group, while Italy did not qual­ify for the 2018 tour­na­ment in Rus­sia.</p>
    <p>“Like us, they have a lot of new play­ers and are still putting out a strong team. They have a dif­fer­ent style now but are still a tech­ni­cal side,” Italy coach Roberto Mancini said.</p>
    <p>“Spain are a great team... they can count on an in­cred­i­ble pool of play­ers in this mo­ment, in the past few years. So they are re­build­ing the team and they are do­ing it well, just like us.”</p>
    <p>His Spain coun­ter­part Luis En­rique added: “Italy may look a lit­tle like us in that they want to re­gain the level of yes­ter­year. They’re in a pe­riod of change.</p>
    <p>“What’s cer­tain is that we and Italy have fol­lowed a sim­i­lar, par­al­lel path, in the sense that we are en­er­gis­ing the na­tional teams with young play­ers and, of course, by im­prov­ing our styles.</p>
    <p>“We have time un­til Oc­to­ber to study them and we’ll see their strengths and weak­nesses.”</p>
    <p>Group A3 win­ners France re­new their ri­valry with Bel­gium, hav­ing beaten them 1-0 in their last meet­ing at the 2018 World Cup semi-fi­nals in Rus­sia be­fore go­ing on to win the tour­na­ment.</p>
    <p>The last time the Red Devils beat Les Bleus in a com­pet­i­tive game was in a World Cup qual­i­fier in 1981 but, like their pre­vi­ous en­counter, coach Roberto Martinez is ex­pect­ing a tight game.</p>
    <p>“It was good to play with them in a great tour­na­ment, we have im­proved a lot since then,” the Bel­gium boss said.</p>
    <p>“We are good in the Fifa rank­ing, we have de­vel­oped many play­ers and both teams know each other very well. We share great mem­o­ries of the World Cup.</p>
    <p>“It will be a fan­tas­tic game, but I think it has been such a suc­cess­ful cam­paign in the Na­tions League that who­ever you were go­ing to meet, it was go­ing to be that sort of big-game feel­ing.”</p>
    <p>France coach Di­dier Deschamps is also look­ing for­ward to the clash as it means a re­turn to Ju­ven­tus’ home ground, where he spent sev­eral tro­phy-laden sea­sons as a player.</p>
    <p>“On a per­sonal level, I’m re­ally happy to be play­ing this game in Turin, in a sta­dium I know well and where I have a lot of friends and ac­quain­tances,” he added.</p>
    <p>“It’ll be a great game which will be hope­fully played with a great at­mos­phere in a sta­dium full of sup­port­ers.”</p>
