    <p>When Chi­nese an­i­ma­tion movie Nezha, the de­but fea­ture of a col­lege dropout who spent years try­ing to fi­nance his movie, opened last year in its home coun­try, it blew past all ex­pec­ta­tions to be­come a run­away sum­mer block­buster.</p>
    <p>It earned more than US$719 mil­lion (S$985 mil­lion) in China alone, mak­ing it the big­gest an­i­mated movie ever in a sin­gle mar­ket.</p>
    <p>To­day, a fol­low-up film set in the same uni­verse as Nezha will open in China and Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>As ex­pected, an­tic­i­pa­tion is rife for Jiang Ziya: Le­gend Of Deifi­ca­tion, which was orig­i­nally slated to open dur­ing Chi­nese New Year but was de­layed due to the Covid-19 pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Cheng Teng, one of two main direc­tors on the project, and codi­rec­tor Wang Xin say in a tele­phone in­ter­view with lo­cal press that they were thank­fully spared the pressure of liv­ing up to Nezha when they were mak­ing their film.</p>
    <p>“The two projects be­gan at around the same time. By the time Nezha opened in Au­gust last year, we were pretty much done too,” says Cheng, 32.</p>
    <p>But Wang, who is in his 40s, adds: “I think the pressure is from au­di­ences’ ex­pec­ta­tions be­cause Nezha did so well at the box of­fice.”</p>
    <p>Nezha was di­rected by Yang Yu, who is 40 this year and is also known by his pseu­do­nym Jiaozi (dumpling in Chi­nese).</p>
    <p>Jiang Ziya, like Nezha, is a fig­ure from the an­cient Chi­nese mytho­log­i­cal folk­lore epic novel In­vesti­ture Of The Gods, whose premise is the fall of the Shang dy­nasty at the hands of a nine-tailed fox de­mon.</p>
    <p>While an­i­ma­tion has been dom­i­nated by Hol­ly­wood and Ja­panese an­ime, the suc­cess of films like Nezha has her­alded a spring in the Chi­nese an­i­ma­tion film in­dus­try.</p>
    <p>Works like Kung Fu Mu­lan and Net­flix’s Chi­nese-backed Over The Moon – the lat­ter is pro­duced by the Shang­hai-based Pearl Stu­dio – are slated to be re­leased this year (see other story).</p>
    <p>On their style of an­i­ma­tion, Wang says: “We used a Chi­nese un­der­stand­ing of beauty. We’re not too overly com­plex in our use of the colours, por­trayal of the scene’s en­vi­ron­ment, the way we ma­nip­u­late the light. We place the vis­ual fo­cus on spots we think are im­por­tant – sim­i­lar to the prac­tice of ‘liu bai’ (the</p>
    <p>Chi­nese artis­tic method of leav­ing blank space on a paint­ing).”</p>
    <p>Both direc­tors worked i n the United States ex­ten­sively be­fore re­turn­ing to China.</p>
    <p>Cheng took up a job at Dream­Works, the an­i­ma­tion stu­dio be­hind beloved Hol­ly­wood fran­chises like Shrek (2001 to 2010) and Mada­gas­car (2005 to 2012), while Wang spent 14 years with Bliz­zard Entertainm­ent’s an­i­ma­tion team. The com­pany is known for video games like World Of War­craft and Over­watch.</p>
    <p>Hav­ing ex­pe­ri­enced the Hol­ly­wood sys­tem, the direc­tors are un­der no pre­tences that Chi­nese an­i­ma­tion is any­where as de­vel­oped as Hol­ly­wood’s.</p>
    <p>“On the tech­ni­cal as­pects of pro­duc­tion, China still has a dis­tance to go,” Cheng notes.</p>
    <p>“But what’s amaz­ing about Hol­ly­wood is the en­tire process of de­vel­op­ing, mak­ing and ex­hibit­ing a film. It has clear rules and a very well-es­tab­lished in­fra­struc­ture. That process doesn’t have a lot of flaws, but at the same time, it’s hard for it to adapt and change as well.”</p>
    <p>He adds: “A lot of Hol­ly­wood an­i­ma­tion works are ul­ti­mately entertainm­ent prod­ucts, but I think Chi­nese ones have more of an au­tho­rial voice. I don’t think we can play catch-up to Hol­ly­wood per se, we have to do our own thing.”</p>

    <p>CHENG TENG, a direc­tor for Jiang Ziya: Le­gend Of Deifi­ca­tion, on the dif­fer­ences be­tween Hol­ly­wood and Chi­nese an­i­ma­tion</p>
    <p>Wang agrees. “Hol­ly­wood studios have great foun­da­tion, but also their own set of chal­lenges.</p>
    <p>“Their su­per­hero movies and the Dis­ney princesses are rela­tively for­mu­laic and they are chang­ing too.</p>
    <p>“The Chi­nese in­dus­try will be fun­da­men­tally dif­fer­ent be­cause the mar­ket is dif­fer­ent. We are ap­peal­ing to dif­fer­ent tastes.”</p>
    <p>He feels that Chi­nese au­di­ences are “more ex­posed to a va­ri­ety of pro­duc­tions from dif­fer­ent mar­kets, be it Asia or Europe or our own do­mes­tic films, while Amer­i­can au­di­ences tend to stick to their own pro­duc­tions”.</p>
    <p>He has high hopes for the fu­ture of Chi­nese an­i­ma­tion. “I think it’ll be a lot of small to medium-sized teams work­ing flu­idly to­gether to cre­ate ma­jor pop cul­ture prop­er­ties,” he says.</p>
    <p>With Jiang Ziya, the team spent 15 months on pre-pro­duc­tion to en­sure that pre-vi­su­al­i­sa­tion of the en­tire film was done and more than 100 em­ploy­ees work­ing in Bei­jing and Suzhou were hired for the an­i­ma­tion work. The film took three years to com­plete.</p>
    <p>The tough­est scenes were the bookends, Wang re­veals.</p>
    <p>“The scene near the be­gin­ning in an inn was hard be­cause there were around 20 char­ac­ters in a con­fined space who all had their own move­ments. Nar­ra­tively, it was an im­por­tant scene too since that is where</p>
    <p>we meet Xiao Jiu, the fe­male lead,” he says.</p>
    <p>“The other scene is near the end – at the door of rein­car­na­tion. There are a lot of dra­matic emo­tions here be­fore cul­mi­nat­ing in a big fi­nal bat­tle be­tween the nine-tailed fox and Jiang Ziya with many ef­fects.”</p>
    <p>Cheng says there are al­ready</p>
    <p>plans for a se­quel, pos­si­bly linked to the story of In­vesti­ture Of The Gods, but no de­tails can be re­vealed at this time.</p>
    <p>But the direc­tors have as­pi­ra­tions be­yond In­vesti­ture Of The Gods for fu­ture projects.</p>
    <p>Cheng says: “I like his­tory, but I also like sci­ence-fic­tion and more</p>
    <p>re­al­ity-based themes too. I won’t stick to a genre.”</p>
    <p>Wang’s in­ter­est lies in an­cient Chi­nese love sto­ries.</p>
    <p>He says: “Some­thing like the (Ming dy­nasty play) The Peony Pavil­ion – a love story be­tween a hu­man and a ghost. I think we Chi­nese have our own ideas about love that</p>
    <p>have not been ex­plored very well yet in film – at least not in an­i­ma­tion.”</p>
