    <p>NEW YORK • No­vak Djokovic has apol­o­gised for his US Open dis­qual­i­fi­ca­tion on Sun­day, declar­ing him­self “ex­tremely sorry” for his mo­ment of mad­ness.</p>
    <p>The 33-year-old was tossed dur­ing his fourth-round match with Spain’s Pablo Car­reno Busta af­ter ac­ci­den­tally hit­ting a ball into the throat of a fe­male line of­fi­cial, who screamed out in pain and fell to the ground.</p>
    <p>In a state­ment on In­sta­gram just hours af­ter his sen­sa­tional exit in New York, the Ser­bian world No. 1 also said he had been left “really sad and empty” by the con­tro­versy.</p>
    <p>“I checked on the lines per­son and the tour­na­ment told me that thank God she is feel­ing ok,” he added.</p>
    <p>“I’m ex­tremely sorry to have caused her such stress. So un­in­tended. So wrong.”</p>
    <p>Djokovic, who left Flush­ing Mead­ows with­out speak­ing to re­porters fol­low­ing his exit, said he would try to learn from the in­ci­dent.</p>
    <p>“As for the dis­qual­i­fi­ca­tion, I need to go back within and work on my dis­ap­point­ment and turn this all into a les­son for my growth and evo­lu­tion as a player and hu­man be­ing,” he said.</p>
    <p>“I apol­o­gize to the @usopen tour­na­ment and ev­ery­one as­so­ci­ated for my be­hav­ior.”</p>
    <p>There was no ques­tion that he hit the judge in­ad­ver­tently, and he quickly rushed to apol­o­gise, but it was a clear breach of Grand Slam rules for­bid­ding the phys­i­cal abuse of any­one within the precincts.</p>
    <p>Tour­na­ment ref­eree So­eren Friemel came out and spoke to chair um­pire Aure­lie Tourte and An­dreas Egli, the Grand Slam su­per­vi­sor, be­fore a long chat with the three-time US Open cham­pion.</p>
    <p>Djokovic, who was clearly mak­ing the point that he had not in­tended to hit the of­fi­cial, was over­heard say­ing: “She doesn’t have to go to hos­pi­tal for this, you’re go­ing to choose a de­fault in this sit­u­a­tion? My career, grand slam, cen­tre stage.”</p>
    <p>But af­ter 12 min­utes of plead­ing his case, his fate was sealed.</p>
    <p>Friemel said there was “no other op­tion” but to dis­qual­ify the Serb, ex­plain­ing that the ac­tion war­ranted re­moval “based on the fact that the ball was hit an­grily, reck­lessly, that it went straight at the line um­pire’s throat”.</p>
    <p>“There are two fac­tors, one is the ac­tion and the re­sult,” he said.</p>
    <p>“And the ac­tion – while there was no in­tent – the re­sult of hit­ting a line um­pire and (her) clearly be­ing hurt is the es­sen­tial fac­tor in the de­ci­sion-mak­ing process here.”</p>
    <p>Ten­nis great John McEn­roe, whose own be­hav­iour fre­quently landed him in hot wa­ter dur­ing his play­ing career, said Djokovic had buck­led un­der the pres­sure.</p>
    <p>“The pres­sure just got to him. I think a lot has been go­ing on off the court,” he told ESPN.</p>
    <p>The Amer­i­can was seem­ingly re­fer­ring to Djokovic’s tur­bu­lent few months when he was criticised for or­gan­is­ing the Adria Tour event in June in which he and sev­eral play­ers tested pos­i­tive for Covid-19.</p>
    <p>He then dropped a bomb­shell on the eve of the US Open by an­nounc­ing he had re­signed as pres­i­dent of the ATP Player Coun­cil to front a new play­ers’ as­so­ci­a­tion.</p>
    <p>“It’s ob­vi­ously af­fected him and whether he likes it or not, he’s go­ing to be the bad guy the rest of his career. If he em­braces that role, I think he could re­cover.</p>
    <p>“But this is a stain that he’s not go­ing to be able to erase,” added McEn­roe.</p>
    <p>The United States Ten­nis As­so­ci­a­tion has said that Djokovic would lose all rank­ing points earned at the tour­na­ment and be fined US$250,000 (S$341,700) – his round-four prize money.</p>
    <p>Fol­low­ing the in­ci­dent, Nick Kyr­gios opened a cheeky Twit­ter poll ask­ing how many years he would be banned if he had hit an of­fi­cial with a ball.</p>
    <p>The Aus­tralian has waged a run­ning bat­tle with Djokovic in re­cent months over his ill-fated Adria Tour, and was quick to have his say.</p>
    <p>“Swap me for jok­ers in­ci­dent,” he said, us­ing Djokovic’s nick­name.</p>
    <p>“Ac­ci­den­tally hit­ting the ball kid in the throat. How many years would I be banned for?”</p>
    <p>The op­tions given were five, 10 or 20 years with the ma­jor­ity vot­ing for 20 years.</p>
    <p>With Djokovic’s exit and de­fend­ing cham­pion Rafael Nadal and Roger Fed­erer ab­sent this year, and no other for­mer Ma­jor win­ners left in the men’s draw, Flush­ing Mead­ows is now guar­an­teed to wel­come a new mem­ber into the Grand Slam cham­pi­ons’ club.</p>
    <p>FU­TILE PLEA</p>
    <p>She doesn’t have to go to hos­pi­tal for this, you’re go­ing to choose a de­fault in this sit­u­a­tion? My career, grand slam, cen­tre stage.</p>
    <p>NO­VAK DJOKOVIC, world No. 1, who was dis­qual­i­fied cor­rectly de­spite mak­ing his point that he did not in­tend any harm.</p>
    <p>PRO­FOUND RE­GRET</p>
    <p>I’m ex­tremely sorry to have caused her such stress. So un­in­tended. So wrong.</p>
    <p>DJOKOVIC, apol­o­gis­ing on In­sta­gram for his se­ri­ous and costly mis­take.</p>
