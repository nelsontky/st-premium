    <p>BEIRUT • Hol­ly­wood star Russell Crowe (left) said he do­nated funds to help re­build a blast-hit Beirut restau­rant on be­half of late food icon An­thony Bour­dain, who loved its tra­di­tional dishes.</p>
    <p>The decades-old Le Chef restau­rant, l ocated i n the heart of a trendy Beirut district, is a beloved neigh­bour­hood place renowned for its home-style cook­ing.</p>
    <p>It was blown to pieces by the Aug 4 ex­plo­sion that killed 171 peo­ple, wounded at least 6,500 and rav­aged swathes of Beirut.</p>
    <p>The Oscar-win­ning Crowe, best known for his role in the 2000 ac­tion film Gla­di­a­tor, said on Twit­ter last Thurs­day that he made the do­na­tion “on be­half of An­thony Bour­dain”.</p>
    <p>“I thought that he would have prob­a­bly done so if he was still around,” Crowe, 56, said of the celebrity chef and travel jour­nal­ist who com­mit­ted sui­cide in 2018. “Hope things can be put back to­gether soon.”</p>
    <p>Crowe’s US$5,000 (S$6,850) do­na­tion was made on a GoFundMe page set up by fans of Le Chef, a restau­rant pop­u­lar with tourists as well as lo­cals in the Gem­mayzeh neigh­bour­hood that was among the hard­est-hit by the ex­plo­sion.</p>
    <p>The on­line fund-raiser raised nearly US$11,000 in less than 24 hours, just US$2,000 short of its tar­get. It has since sur­passed that amount with more than US$18,000 raised as of yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Le Chef is where Bour­dain had his first meal when he and his crew were trapped in Le­banon for a week in 2006 be­cause of a month­long war with Is­rael.</p>
    <p>It is fea­tured in the highly praised Le­banon episode of his No Reser­va­tions se­ries.</p>
    <p>“Re­ally good food, very tra­di­tional,” Bour­dain says of the restau­rant in the show, call­ing it a “nice mix” of old and new. It’s a “good first meal in Beirut”.</p>
