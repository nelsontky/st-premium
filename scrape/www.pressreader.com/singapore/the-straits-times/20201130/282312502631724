    <p>• Over 80 species of res­i­dent and mi­gra­tory birds live on Coney Is­land.</p>
    <p>• Part of the North Eastern River­ine Loop, the is­land has coastal forests, grass­lands, man­groves and ca­sua­r­ina wood­lands.</p>
    <p>• Birds that can be found there in­clude the scaly-breasted mu­nia (Lonchura punc­tu­lata) and baya weaver (Plo­ceus philip­pi­nus).</p>
    <p>The baya weaver (left) is known for its glob­u­lar nests, which are usu­ally found hang­ing from aca­cia trees. These in­tri­cately built cham­bers are in­spected by fe­male weavers, which al­low only males that pass their qual­ity con­trol to mate with them.</p>
    <p>• The Eastern Coastal Loop is per­fect for beach-lov­ing bird watch­ers.</p>
    <p>• The trail cuts through Pasir Ris Park, which is home to owls such as the buffy fish owl (Ke­tupa ke­tupu) and the spot­ted wood owl (Strix selop­uto).</p>
    <p>• East Coast Park is an­other pit stop with a va­ri­ety of birds such as the lit­tle bronze cuckoo (Chryso­coccy x minu­til­lus) and laced wood­pecker (Pi­cus vit­ta­tus).</p>
    <p>The lit­tle bronze cuckoo (right) is one of the small­est cuckoo species in the world. This par­a­sitic bird lays eggs in the nests of smaller gar­den birds so that its chicks can be raised by these fos­ter par­ents.</p>
