    <p>The Lim family-run Xihe Hold­ings and four of its ves­sel-own­ing units are be­ing brought un­der “ur­gent” ju­di­cial man­age­ment by cred­i­tor OCBC Bank, which “strongly dis­trusts (their) cur­rent man­age­ment” after US$208.1 mil­lion (S$288 mil­lion) was trans­ferred by the Xihe group to trou­bled oil trader Hin Leong “for no valid com­mer­cial pur­pose”, ac­cord­ing to court doc­u­ments seen by The Straits Times.</p>
    <p>OCBC ap­plied to the High Court on Mon­day for Mr Se­shadri Ra­jagopalan and Mr Paresh Jotan­gia of Grant Thornton Sin­ga­pore to be ap­pointed as in­terim ju­di­cial man­agers (IJM) for Xihe and four of its sub­sidiaries: Da Xin Tankers, Hua</p>
    <p>Guang Ship­ping, Nan King Mar­itime and Hua Xin Ship­ping.</p>
    <p>Among the rea­sons OCBC cited is that the Lim family, which owns and man­ages the Xihe group, has “ad­mit­ted to and/or been found to have fab­ri­cated fic­ti­tious gains and forged doc­u­ments on a mas­sive scale, con­cealed mas­sive losses, mis­used se­cured in­ven­tory and mis­led banks into ex­tend­ing fi­nanc­ing to Hin Leong, caus­ing (the) bil­lion­dol­lar in­sol­ven­cies of Hin Leong and Ocean Tankers”.</p>
    <p>Hin Leong and its ship­ping arm Ocean Tankers ini­tially sought a six-month mora­to­rium on debts of more than US$3.6 bil­lion to 23 banks. Court fil­ings cited the col­lapse in crude prices and the coro­n­avirus pan­demic, which bat­tered oil de­mand and pushed up costs for Hin Leong.</p>
    <p>The oil trader’s founder Lim Oon Kuin ad­mit­ted that he had di­rected the firm to hide about US$800 mil­lion in fu­tures trad­ing losses.</p>
    <p>OCBC noted that the Lims fur­ther paid them­selves div­i­dends of US$30 mil­lion in 2017 and US$60 mil­lion in 2018 from Hin Leong when there were no prof­its to sup­port such div­i­dends, and with­drew US$19 mil­lion from Ocean Tankers shortly be­fore fil­ing for the debt mora­to­rium.</p>
    <p>Both com­pa­nies have since with­drawn the debt mora­to­rium ap­pli­ca­tion and sought to be brought un­der ju­di­cial man­age­ment.</p>
    <p>Ocean Tankers’ ex­po­sure to po­ten­tial claims of US$2.67 bil­lion al­legedly stems from its deal­ings with the oil trader.</p>
    <p>The se­ri­ous ir­reg­u­lar­i­ties ex­tend to the af­fairs of Xihe and its four units, OCBC noted. It pointed out that “bare­boat char­ters of OCBC-fi­nanced ves­sels were ter­mi­nated without OCBC’s con­sent, and the Xihe units have per­sis­tently failed to... col­lect pay­ments from Ocean Tankers for months or years, to the prej­u­dice of cred­i­tors of the Xihe group, and in breach of con­trac­tual obli­ga­tions owed to OCBC”.</p>
    <p>“Es­pe­cially in the light of the in­ter­linked busi­nesses, com­mon own­er­ship and lead­er­ship of the debtor com­pa­nies, Hin Leong and Ocean Tankers, in­de­pen­dent ju­di­cial man­agers need to be ap­pointed ur­gently over the debtor com­pa­nies to in­ves­ti­gate the se­ri­ous ir­reg­u­lar­i­ties and pre­vent fur­ther prej­u­dice to cred­i­tors,” OCBC said.</p>
    <p>It fur­ther pointed out that the cur­rent or re­cent man­age­ment of Xihe “may in­clude in­di­vid­u­als who would have been privy to... the fi­nan­cial mis­re­port­ing, mis­use of se­cured in­ven­tory and other is­sues plagu­ing Hin Leong, and to a cer­tain ex­tent, Ocean Tankers”.</p>
    <p>With the neg­a­tive pub­lic­ity and po­ten­tial claims in re­la­tion to the mas­sive fraud un­cov­ered in Hin Leong and Ocean Tankers, the ap­point­ment of IJM will help “restore con­fi­dence of po­ten­tial in­vestors, ves­sel pur­chasers and other coun­ter­par­ties”, the bank added.</p>
    <p>The risk of ar­rest or claims against ves­sels of the debtor com­pa­nies mounts daily, it said.</p>
    <p>“Ves­sels owned by the Xihe group have al­ready been sub­ject to nu­mer­ous writs, with the ma­jor­ity of the fleet idling in in­ter­na­tional wa­ters, cost­ing a for­tune in lost in­come and ex­penses daily.</p>
    <p>“A mora­to­rium would give the debtor com­pa­nies the time and breath­ing space to prop­erly re­struc­ture the debts, and bet­ter pre­serve the value of the ves­sels.</p>
    <p>“In a liq­ui­da­tion or en­force­ment ac­tion taken by cred­i­tors against Xihe and its sub­sidiaries, it is likely that (their) as­sets would be sold at dis­tress val­ues, which would re­sult in a low re­cov­ery for its cred­i­tors.</p>
    <p>“Liq­ui­da­tion and en­force­ment ac­tion against the Xihe group will also re­sult in a sudden flood of ves­sels into the sec­ond-hand mar­ket, fur­ther de­press­ing the price re­cov­er­able by cred­i­tors,” OCBC said.</p>
    <p>Fur­ther, the bank noted that the Xihe group ap­pears to be “short of crew, com­pe­tence/ca­pac­ity and money to make pay­ments on tak­ing re­de­liv­ery of the ves­sels, which has led to ves­sels of the group be­ing stuck with Ocean Tankers even though Ocean Tankers does not ap­pear to be pay­ing char­ter hire for it”.</p>
    <p>The IJM will be able to en­gage pro­fes­sional ship man­agers to help with the tech­ni­cal and com­mer­cial man­age­ment of the ves­sels, if nec­es­sary, the bank added.</p>
    <p>Mr Lim said in an af­fi­davit filed in April that the pro­posed re­struc­tur­ing of Hin Leong will be “linked to or in­ter­twined with Ocean Tankers’ debt re­struc­tur­ing, as Ocean Tankers’ li­a­bil­i­ties are re­lated to the debts owed by Hin Leong to its bank lenders”.</p>
    <p>While de­tails of the scheme of ar­range­ment are yet to be worked out, Mr Lim said the broad terms are likely to in­clude, among other things, “the in­jec­tion of as­sets by the Lim family, such as the family’s shares in the Xihe group and Uni­ver­sal Group Hold­ings”. Mr Lim and his family own 41 per cent of Uni­ver­sal Ter­mi­nal through Uni­ver­sal Group.</p>
    <p>With li­a­bil­i­ties of US$3.5 bil­lion and as­sets of just US$257 mil­lion, PwC, the IJM for Hin Leong, has pointed out that the “re­struc­tur­ing of Hin Leong on its own is un­likely to re­sult in a re­cov­ery that is bet­ter than liq­ui­da­tion”.</p>
    <p>PwC also pointed out that there may be some prospect of re­struc­tur­ing if Hin Leong is put to­gether with other firms in the group, and if the Lim family in­jects per­sonal as­sets as well.</p>
    <p>But the Lim family has not re­sponded to this rec­om­men­da­tion and has hired the law firm Davin­der Singh Cham­bers to rep­re­sent them.</p>
