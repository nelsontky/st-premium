    <p>Q What has been your big­gest in­vest­ing mis­take?</p>
    <p>A Sadly, I made the same big mis­take twice. I was un­der the im­pres­sion that I could man­age a busi­ness re­motely, set up pro­cesses and that it would run on its own.</p>
    <p>The first in­stance was in 2008, when I was 29, with a B2B (busi­ness-to-busi­ness) lo­gis­tics mag­a­zine pub­lish­ing busi­ness in In­dia. I was liv­ing in Dubai at the time.</p>
    <p>I failed mis­er­ably and then thought I had learnt from it. Un­for­tu­nately, I did it again with a purely on­line pub­li­ca­tion in 2013.</p>
    <p>It was easy to set up but com­pli­ca­tions start when you hire a team and you need to de­vote more time to man­age. For earlystage com­pa­nies, es­pe­cially in emerg­ing coun­tries, it is tough if you are not there phys­i­cally.</p>
    <p>The ex­pen­sive lessons learnt were, one, there is a huge dif­fer­ence be­tween in­vest­ing and man­ag­ing a busi­ness. Two, there is no such thing as pas­sive and re­mote man­age­ment.</p>
    <p>I lost about $200,000 in both in­vest­ments.</p>
    <p>Q A</p>
    <p>And your best in­vest­ment?</p>
    <p>It was in DealStreet­Asia, a me­dia start-up which tracks pri­vate eq­uity and ven­ture cap­i­tal ac­tiv­ity across South-east Asia and In­dia.</p>
    <p>I was its first in­vestor and ex­ited last year when it was bought by Nikkei, which owns and pub­lishes the Fi­nan­cial Times and the Nikkei Asian Re­view. I made more than six times in less than three years.</p>
    <p>I knew the founder per­son­ally and he was well known as a busi­ness jour­nal­ist. The on­line busi­ness news me­dia was boom­ing and I had a gut feel­ing that it would find trac­tion in the re­gion.</p>
    <p>I do not have a lot of cap­i­tal to de­ploy and early-stage in­vest­ing is of­ten about gut feel­ing and how much trust you have in the founder.</p>
