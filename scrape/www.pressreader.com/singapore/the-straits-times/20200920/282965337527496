    <p>Ahn Sung-mi</p>
    <p>The Korea Her­ald, South Korea</p>
    <p>While some have ex­pressed op­ti­mism that the exit of the hawk­ish Ja­panese premier Shinzo Abe might re­vi­talise Seoul-Tokyo re­la­tions, which have de­te­ri­o­rated un­der his watch, many ex­perts be­lieve new Prime Min­is­ter Yoshi­hide Suga will ad­here to his pre­de­ces­sor’s poli­cies.</p>
    <p>Though Mr Suga hasn’t re­vealed his pol­icy di­rec­tion in de­tail, he has said “con­ti­nu­ity is what’s im­por­tant in diplo­macy” when asked how closely he plans to fol­low Mr Abe’s for­eign pol­icy. He added that he would con­sult with Mr Abe on for­eign pol­icy.</p>
    <p>“It will be hard to see a dras­tic change in Ja­pan’s po­si­tion to­wards South Korea, as Mr Suga vowed to con­tinue with Mr Abe’s poli­cies,” Ja­pan ex­pert Choi Eun-mi of the Asan In­sti­tute for Pol­icy Stud­ies in Seoul told The Korea Her­ald.</p>
    <p>“For Mr Suga, prov­ing his le­git­i­macy as the new prime min­is­ter will be crit­i­cal. Within Ja­pan’s po­lit­i­cal dy­nam­ics, he can­not ig­nore LDP fac­tions that sup­ported him in the elec­tion. This means it is un­likely that he will voice a rad­i­cal change in re­gards to Korea that goes against the main­stream LDP stance.”</p>
    <p>Mr Abe was a leader with a strong per­sona, Mr Lee Won-deok, an ex­pert on Ja­pan at Kook­min Univer­sity in Seoul, ex­plained. Whereas Mr Suga is more of a “real­ist” whose mo­tives would be in­ter­est and pop­u­lar­ity.</p>
    <p>“This means if Seoul has a strong will­ing­ness to im­prove ties, there will be more diplo­matic space for Seoul to work around,” he said. “While Ja­pan does not openly ad­mit it, it is ap­par­ent that Ja­pan’s ex­port curbs are ret­ri­bu­tion for a Seoul court’s rul­ing on forced labour. If Seoul could come up with a more flex­i­ble ap­proach on the forced labour is­sue and in re­gards to liq­ui­dat­ing Ja­panese firms’ as­sets, Ja­pan could ease the ex­port con­trols,” he added.</p>
    <p>De­spite de­te­ri­o­rated re­la­tions, ex­perts hope for re­sum­ing stalled talks be­tween Seoul and Tokyo, with some an­tic­i­pa­tion that the planned tri­lat­eral sum­mit be­tween China, Ja­pan and Korea sched­uled for Novem­ber could make a break­through.</p>
