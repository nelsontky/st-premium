    <p>While Covid-19 might be dom­i­nat­ing the head­lines to­day, Sin­ga­pore has sur­vived pre­vi­ous out­breaks of deadly dis­eases, such as small­pox in the 1950s, as re­ported in the pages of this news­pa­per.</p>
    <p>In 1959, The Straits Times re­ported that a 49-year-old was the first per­son to die of small­pox here.</p>
    <p>Over the decades, ST has wit­nessed how Sin­ga­pore fought the hor­ror of epi­demics, and cel­e­brated its march to­wards in­de­pen­dence, as well as how other coun­tries weath­ered fi­nan­cial crises and civil un­rest. Re­ports of these events have helped read­ers make sense of de­vel­op­ments at home and around the world.</p>
    <p>Now, in an in­ter­ac­tive graphic, read­ers can see the head­lines – more than 47,000 of them – that have made it to the front page since July 15, 1845.</p>
    <p>The project, launched to mark ST’s 175th an­niver­sary this year, al­lows read­ers to select a date and see what was page one news for that day.</p>
    <p>The ST dig­i­tal graph­ics team also an­a­lysed all the front-page head­lines and grouped them into five ma­jor top­ics: epi­demics, for­eign af­fairs, lo­cal towns, vices and crimes, and war and peace.</p>
    <p>An al­go­rithm that gives weight to how im­por­tant sub­jects were in their re­spec­tive years was used. The charts help vi­su­alise how heav­ily each topic was men­tioned in the head­lines.</p>
    <p>For ex­am­ple, the key­word “Lon­don” peaked dur­ing 1940, when a bomb­ing cam­paign by the Ger­mans hap­pened dur­ing World War II.</p>
    <p>In a lo­cal ex­am­ple, the key­word “Tan­jong Pa­gar” was no­tably men­tioned around 1905 be­cause of the Tan­jong Pa­gar Dock­ing com­pany, ear­lier known for its fa­cil­i­ties to re­pair ves­sels com­ing from the West.</p>
    <p>Read­ers can also search for other key­words to see the cor­re­spond­ing re­sults for the past 175 years.</p>
    <p>Said Straits Times edi­tor War­ren Fer­nan­dez: “ST has been record­ing the sig­nif­i­cant mo­ments in the life of this coun­try, and our world, and serv­ing our read­ers over many gen­er­a­tions.</p>
    <p>“This in­ter­ac­tive project will al­low younger, and fu­ture, gen­er­a­tions to share some of those mo­ments. ST very much hopes to keep track­ing and telling these sto­ries for many more years to come.”</p>
