    <p>In­done­sia is ex­pected to en­joy a boost in ex­ports amid US-China ten­sions, after the United States ex­tended spe­cial tar­iff con­ces­sions to South-east Asia’s largest economy.</p>
    <p>The priv­i­lege, called the Gen­er­alised Sys­tem of Pref­er­ences (GSP), cov­ers more than 3,500 mer­chan­dise items rang­ing from elec­tronic prod­ucts and chil­dren’s toys to sports equip­ment and wigs. Last year, about 700 In­done­sia ex­port prod­ucts shipped to the US used this fa­cil­ity.</p>
    <p>In­done­sian ex­ports have been en­joy­ing the GSP fa­cil­ity given by the US since 1980.</p>
    <p>Last year, In­done­sian ex­ports worth US$2.61 bil­lion (S$3.5 bil­lion), or 13 per cent of its to­tal US$20.1 bil­lion ex­ports to the US, were el­i­gi­ble.</p>
    <p>In 2018, the US said it re­viewed the el­i­gi­bil­ity of In­done­sia and sev­eral other de­vel­op­ing coun­tries in­clud­ing In­dia for the GSP.</p>
    <p>Last Fri­day, the US de­cided to close the re­view for In­done­sia, mak­ing it the only coun­try in Asia that did not see any change of terms in its GSP sta­tus.</p>
    <p>The de­ci­sion to close the re­view – taken only days after US Sec­re­tary of State Mike Pom­peo vis­ited Jakarta last week – would place In­done­sia in a bet­ter bar­gain­ing po­si­tion to at­tract ma­jor com­pa­nies want­ing to shift their pro­duc­tion base from China, or want­ing to di­ver­sify their pro­duc­tion base be­yond just one or two lo­ca­tions, ac­cord­ing to the In­done­sian gov­ern­ment.</p>
    <p>In an Oct 30 let­ter to Co­or­di­nat­ing Mar­itime Af­fairs and In­vest­ment Min­is­ter Luhut Pand­jai­tan to in­form Jakarta of the de­ci­sion, US trade rep­re­sen­ta­tive Robert Lighthizer said he wel­comed, among oth­ers, In­done­sia’s lat­est move in stream­lin­ing red tape in­tended to ex­pe­dite in­creases in US im­ports of fruit to In­done­sia.</p>
    <p>“Clo­sure of this re­view is a recog­ni­tion of In­done­sia’s pos­i­tive and pro­duc­tive en­gage­ment over the past 21/ years to strengthen the</p>
    <p>2 trade re­la­tion­ship be­tween the US and In­done­sia by ad­dress­ing the mar­ket ac­cess con­cerns we raised,” Mr Lighthizer said in the let­ter, which was seen by The Straits Times.</p>
    <p>The US is the fourth-largest fruit ex­porter to In­done­sia after China, Thai­land and Aus­tralia. Last year, the US shipped US$125 mil­lion worth of fruit to In­done­sia.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, the US is In­done­sia’s sec­ond-largest ex­port des­ti­na­tion after China for non-oil and gas, with ex­ports to the US to­talling US$20.1 bil­lion last year.</p>
    <p>Pres­i­dent Joko Wi­dodo told his Cab­i­net on Mon­day that In­done­sia should use the GSP ex­ten­sion to at­tract in­vestors to come into the coun­try, not­ing that man­u­fac­tur­ing plants were mov­ing out of China to cir­cum­vent tar­iffs im­posed by the US on Chi­nese goods in their trade war.</p>
    <p>“It would be good if we can use this to at­tract in­vest­ment… This fa­cil­ity would en­cour­age in­vestors to set up plants, com­pa­nies in In­done­sia,” Mr Joko said.</p>
    <p>Vice-For­eign Min­is­ter Ma­hen­dra Sire­gar added: “Not only In­done­sia’s ex­ports would in­crease, but in­vest­ments would also in­crease. In­vest­ments from the US, other for­eign coun­tries, as well as do­mes­tic.”</p>
    <p>He added that In­done­sia’s grow­ing dig­i­tal busi­ness and in­for­ma­tion com­mu­ni­ca­tions tech­nol­ogy busi­ness would also at­tract fur­ther in­vest­ment, cit­ing a re­search re­port that fore­cast that In­done­sia’s dig­i­tal economy – cur­rently val­ued at US$40 bil­lion – would grow to US$133 bil­lion in five years.</p>
    <p>In­done­sian Am­bas­sador to the US Muham­mad Lutfi told re­porters on Mon­day dur­ing a vir­tual briefing that the GSP ex­ten­sion given to In­done­sia was based on the mu­tual gains of In­done­sia’s fur­ther open­ing up of its mar­ket to the US.</p>
    <p>He cited the ex­am­ple of how In­done­sia re­cently ended long­stand­ing pro­tec­tion­ism in the potato sec­tor, al­low­ing pre­mium Amer­i­can­farmed pota­toes to be supplied to the lo­cal snack in­dus­try.</p>
    <p>“We used to fo­cus on how we could im­port as lit­tle as pos­si­ble and ex­port as much as pos­si­ble. This is an old mind­set that we can no longer cling to. It is an era of col­lab­o­ra­tion now,” Mr Lutfi said.</p>
    <p>He added that among the par­ties that would ben­e­fit the most from the con­tin­ued GSP fa­cil­ity in In­done­sia are small and medi­um­sized en­ter­prises, es­pe­cially those who make jewellery, travel goods (such as back­packs and camp­ing tents) and fur­ni­ture, whose prod­ucts sell very well in the US.</p>
    <p>GOOD FOR FOR­EIGN IN­VEST­MENT</p>
    <p>This fa­cil­ity would en­cour­age in­vestors to set up plants, com­pa­nies in In­done­sia.</p>
