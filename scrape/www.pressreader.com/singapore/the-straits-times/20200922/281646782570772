    <p>Sin­ga­pore res­i­dents be­gan col­lect­ing two re­us­able masks each yes­ter­day, in the fourth na­tion­wide re­us­able mask dis­tri­bu­tion ex­er­cise, to help shield against Covid-19.</p>
    <p>A Te­masek Foun­da­tion ini­tia­tive, the masks can be col­lected from StayMasked vend­ing ma­chines at about 800 lo­ca­tions by scan­ning the bar­codes of an NRIC, a school smart­card, birth cer­tifi­cate, FIN or any gov­ern­ment-is­sued iden­ti­fi­ca­tion with a bar­code. They can be col­lected over a two-week pe­riod un­til Oct 4. Al­though a use­ful and sus­tain­able al­ter­na­tive to sin­gle-use dis­pos­able masks, re­us­able masks should be washed reg­u­larly and re­placed af­ter a rec­om­mended pe­riod of time.</p>
    <p>Here are some things to note about re­us­able masks.</p>
    <p>Q How long should I use the new re­us­able masks?</p>
    <p>A The lat­est masks given out by Te­masek Foun­da­tion are for daily use. Each mask can be washed up to 30 times.</p>
    <p>In­fec­tious dis­eases ex­pert Leong Hoe Nam ad­vises users to check that the mask fits their face and cheeks well, as un­fil­tered air could en­ter through the side of a loose mask.</p>
    <p>When used on a “wear one, wash one” cy­cle daily, each mask kit with a pair should last for two months. Af­ter that, the masks re­main us­able, but their anti-mi­cro­bial ef­fec­tive­ness and fil­tra­tion are less ef­fec­tive.</p>
    <p>Q What is the best method to wash the re­us­able mask? A Wash­ing and dry­ing is sim­ple but needs to be done cor­rectly so the mask re­mains ef­fec­tive for a longer pe­riod of time.</p>
    <p>Use a gentle soap and luke­warm wa­ter so­lu­tion. Do not use an­ti­sep­tic de­ter­gent or bleach.</p>
    <p>The mask man­u­fac­turer says the masks may be soaked in wa­ter for a longer pe­riod of time to wash off stains from cos­met­ics. It is not ad­vis­able to use make-up re­mover as it may af­fect the pro­tec­tive qual­i­ties of these masks.</p>
    <p>Q How of­ten should I wash my re­us­able mask?</p>
    <p>A The mask should be washed af­ter each day of use, ac­cord­ing to the guide­lines given in the mask kit. Dr Leong ad­vises users to be care­ful when wash­ing the mask as ag­gres­sive wash­ing or the use of a wash­board to clean the fab­ric may dam­age it quickly.</p>
    <p>Q How do I dis­pose of the re­us­able mask af­ter the rec­om­mended pe­riod of use?</p>
    <p>A The face mask should be dis­posed of as you would a sur­gi­cal mask – in a rub­bish bag with other waste or in a bin. Al­ter­na­tively, cleaned masks can be up­cy­cled in var­i­ous ways.</p>
    <p>For ex­am­ple, they can be re­pur­posed as a clean­ing cloth, or a pouch for your spec­ta­cles or keys, since they are made of cot­ton.</p>
    <p>Q Why should I stop wear­ing the re­us­able mask af­ter the rec­om­mended pe­riod of use?</p>
    <p>A Af­ter 30 washes, the an­timi­cro­bial as well as fil­tra­tion prop­er­ties of the mask be­come less ef­fec­tive. Dr Leong in­di­cated the mask’s ef­fec­tive­ness could drop by be­tween 10 and 15 per cent.</p>
    <p>When used on a “wear one, wash one” cy­cle daily, each mask kit with a pair should last for two months. Af­ter that, the masks re­main us­able, but their anti-mi­cro­bial ef­fec­tive­ness and fil­tra­tion are less ef­fec­tive.</p>
