    <p>LOS AN­GE­LES • Be­fore the three­month coro­n­avirus-en­forced shut­down of the PGA Tour, Rory McIl­roy was close to his very best – back at world No. 1 af­ter six con­sec­u­tive top-five fin­ishes, in­clud­ing a WGC vic­tory in Shang­hai.</p>
    <p>Since the restart in June, his strug­gles with only two top-15 fin­ishes in eight starts had seemed in­ex­pli­ca­ble un­til now.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing the BMW Cham­pi­onship last week­end, the North­ern Ir­ish­man re­vealed why his mind may have been elsewhere.</p>
    <p>McIl­roy and wife Erica Stoll are ex­pect­ing the birth of their first child, a girl, any day now.</p>
    <p>“I think from the get-go, my mind has been wan­der­ing the last few weeks, and now you guys sort of know the rea­son why,” said the four-time Ma­jor win­ner.</p>
    <p>“I didn’t think it was some­thing that I re­ally par­tic­u­larly needed to share out there.</p>
    <p>“It’s a pri­vate mat­ter, but we’re re­ally ex­cited and can’t wait for her to get here.</p>
    <p>“You’re go­ing out to play and maybe not know­ing whether you’re go­ing to fin­ish the round or not.</p>
    <p>“Look, it’s def­i­nitely not an ex­cuse. I j ust haven’t played well enough.</p>
    <p>“But again, I keep talk­ing about per­spec­tive. If you do play bad, I’ve got some awe­some stuff com­ing up on the hori­zon, which is re­ally cool, and it makes the bad days a lot eas­ier to han­dle.”</p>
    <p>He still in­tends to de­fend his Tour Cham­pi­onship, which starts on Fri­day, and the FedExCup crown at East Lake in Atlanta, but will not hes­i­tate to jump on a plane if he gets a call.</p>
    <p>“I’d be out of here. I’m go­ing to play in many more Tour Cham­pi­onships and it’s only go­ing to be the birth of your first child once.”</p>
    <p>The 31-year-old met Amer­i­can Stoll when she was work­ing for the PGA of Amer­ica and af­ter dat­ing for two years, they mar­ried in a lav­ish re­cep­tion at Ash­worth Cas­tle in County Mayo, Ire­land, i n 2017.</p>
