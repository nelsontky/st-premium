    <p>Malaysia’s Sabah state is on the verge of chang­ing gov­ern­ments, with at least 14 as­sem­bly­men ex­pected to desert Chief Min­is­ter Shafie Ap­dal in favour of the Perikatan Na­sional pact helmed by Prime Min­is­ter Muhyid­din Yassin.</p>
    <p>Malaysia’s Sabah state is on the verge of chang­ing gov­ern­ments, with as­sem­bly­men for­merly loyal to Chief Min­is­ter Shafie Ap­dal ex­pected to de­fect to the Perikatan Na­sional (PN) pact helmed by Prime Min­is­ter Muhyid­din Yassin.</p>
    <p>Well-placed sources told The</p>
    <p>Straits Times that at least 14 as­sem­bly­men have agreed to desert Datuk Seri Shafie – a staunch ally of for­mer premier Ma­hathir Mo­hamad – and back his pre­de­ces­sor and ri­val Musa Aman in­stead.</p>
    <p>How­ever, Tan Sri Musa has been un­able to se­cure an au­di­ence with Sabah’s cer­e­mo­nial head of state, and it is un­der­stood that at least two po­ten­tial de­fec­tors are wa­ver­ing, leav­ing PN shy of the nec­es­sary num­bers to top­ple Parti Warisan Sabah pres­i­dent Shafie.</p>
    <p>“There may be more (de­fec­tors). But for now, we have to wait for an au­di­ence with the gov­er­nor,” a top PN of­fi­cial said.</p>
    <p>If PN is suc­cess­ful, this would make Sabah the lat­est in a string of states l ost by Pakatan Hara­pan (PH) and its al­lies af­ter its fed­eral gov­ern­ment col­lapsed at the end of Fe­bru­ary.</p>
    <p>PH was left with­out ma­jor­ity sup­port in Par­lia­ment, af­ter Tan Sri Muhyid­din led some 40 law­mak­ers out of the coali­tion.</p>
    <p>PN cur­rently con­trols nine of Malaysia’s 13 state gov­ern­ments, hav­ing cap­tured Jo­hor, Me­laka, Perak and Kedah, with PH con­fined to the coun­try’s rich­est state Se­lan­gor, Pe­nang and Negeri Sem­bi­lan.</p>
    <p>Mr Musa was Sabah’s chief min­is­ter for 15 years un­til Umno’s shock de­feat in the May 2018 elec­tion to PH. His come­back gath­ered mo­men­tum af­ter all 46 counts of graft lev­elled against him, when PH was in power, were with­drawn on June 9.</p>
    <p>Sources with knowl­edge of the im­pend­ing changes in Sabah told ST that there had been dis­sent within the PN ranks as to who should head the gov­ern­ment of the East Malaysian state, with Ber­satu state chief Ha­jiji Noor among the front run­ners.</p>
    <p>But it is un­der­stood that dis­cus­sions be­tween Ber­satu pres­i­dent Muhyid­din and Mr Musa, bro­kered by Se­nior Min­is­ter for the Econ­omy Azmin Ali, have paved the way for the coup.</p>
    <p>How­ever, Mr Musa’s re­turn to power must still ob­tain the as­sent of the state’s Gov­er­nor Juhar Mahirud­din, a found­ing mem­ber of Umno in Sabah.</p>
    <p>If it is clear that Mr Shafie no longer com­mands sup­port of the state assem­bly, Tun Juhar must ask him to re­sign. But Mr Shafie can also ask the gov­er­nor to call for snap polls.</p>
    <p>Mr Shafie is cur­rently backed by 45 as­sem­bly­men, or two-thirds of the 65-seat state assem­bly. This means that the Ber­satu-led op­po­si­tion will need at least 13 de­fec­tors to se­cure power.</p>
    <p>A change in Sabah could sig­nif­i­cantly im­pact the fed­eral sit­u­a­tion, where the PN gov­ern­ment holds only a slim ma­jor­ity with 113 of Par­lia­ment’s 222 law­mak­ers.</p>
    <p>Some of the 10 Sabah MPs cur­rently in fed­eral op­po­si­tion could be per­suaded to cross the floor, if PN takes over the state.</p>
    <p>NEXT STEPS</p>
    <p>There may be more (de­fec­tors). But for now, we have to wait for an au­di­ence with the</p>
    <p>’’ gov­er­nor.</p>
    <p>A TOP PERIKATAN NA­SIONAL OF­FI­CIAL said, re­fer­ring to Sabah’s cer­e­mo­nial head of state.</p>
