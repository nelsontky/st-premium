    <p>NEW YORK/BEI­JING • US Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump yes­ter­day said he would re­scind his ten­ta­tive bless­ing for a deal be­tween Or­a­cle and ByteDance to cre­ate a new USbased TikTok ser­vice if the Chi­nese com­pany re­tains con­trol of the op­er­a­tion.</p>
    <p>Speak­ing in an in­ter­view on Fox News, Mr Trump also in­di­cated that he expected Chi­nese in­flu­ence to be di­luted by a fu­ture pub­lic of­fer­ing of the new com­pany. “They will have noth­ing to do with it, and if they do, we just won’t make the deal,” Mr Trump said, re­fer­ring to TikTok’s owner ByteDance.</p>
    <p>“It’s go­ing to be con­trolled, to­tally con­trolled by Or­a­cle, and I guess they’re go­ing pub­lic and they’re buy­ing out the rest of it... and if we find that they don’t have to­tal con­trol then we’re not go­ing to ap­prove the deal.”</p>
    <p>China’s ByteDance yes­ter­day said TikTok’s global busi­ness will be­come its sub­sidiary, even as Or­a­cle and Wal­mart said over the week­end that they and other US in­vestors would own the ma­jor­ity of the video app fol­low­ing a deal with Mr Trump’s ad­min­is­tra­tion.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump signed an ex­ec­u­tive or­der on Aug 14 giv­ing ByteDance 90 days to sell TikTok, amid con­cerns that the per­sonal data of as many as 100 mil­lion Amer­i­cans that use the app could be passed on to China’s Com­mu­nist Party gov­ern­ment.</p>
    <p>Last Satur­day, he said that he sup­ported a deal in prin­ci­ple that would al­low TikTok to con­tinue to op­er­ate in the United States.</p>
    <p>But ac­counts of the deal dif­fer. ByteDance said in a state­ment yes­ter­day that it will own 80 per cent of TikTok Global, a newly cre­ated US com­pany that will own most of the app’s op­er­a­tions world­wide.</p>
    <p>Or­a­cle and Wal­mart, which have agreed to take stakes in TikTok Global of 12.5 per cent and 7.5 per cent re­spec­tively, had said last Satur­day that ma­jor­ity own­er­ship of TikTok would be in US hands.</p>
    <p>ByteDance’s state­ment said it was a “ru­mour” that US in­vestors would be TikTok Global’s ma­jor­ity own­ers and that ByteDance would lose con­trol over TikTok. Some sources close to the deal have sought to rec­on­cile the dis­crep­ancy by point­ing out that 41 per cent of ByteDance is owned by US in­vestors, so by count­ing this in­di­rect own­er­ship, TikTok Global would be ma­jor­ity owned by US par­ties.</p>
    <p>One of the sources said the deal with Or­a­cle and Wal­mart val­ues TikTok Global at more than US$50 bil­lion (S$67.7 bil­lion).</p>
    <p>TikTok also con­firmed plans for an ini­tial pub­lic of­fer­ing of TikTok Global. The Bei­jing-based firm said TikTok Global’s board of di­rec­tors will in­clude ByteDance founder Zhang Yim­ing as well as Wal­mart’s chief ex­ec­u­tive Doug McMil­lon and cur­rent di­rec­tors of ByteDance.</p>
    <p>Or­a­cle and Wal­mart had said in a joint state­ment on Satur­day that four out of the five board of di­rec­tors will be Amer­i­cans.</p>
    <p>The cur­rent plan for TikTok Global does not in­volve any trans­fer of al­go­rithms or tech­nolo­gies, and Or­a­cle will be able to in­spect TikTok US’ source code, ac­cord­ing to ByteDance.</p>
    <p>Or­a­cle and Wal­mart have said that all of TikTok’s tech­nol­ogy will be in the pos­ses­sion of TikTok Global.</p>
    <p>ByteDance also said a US$5 bil­lion pay­ment of taxes that TikTok Global is re­port­edly sup­posed to make to the US Trea­sury is based on es­ti­mated in­come and other taxes the com­pany will need to pay over the next few years and has noth­ing to do with the deal reached with Or­a­cle and Wal­mart.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump last week said there would be a US$5 bil­lion US ed­u­ca­tion fund as part of the deal, but ByteDance has said it was not aware of this.</p>
