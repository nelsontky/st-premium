    <p>A Bri­tish cou­ple have thanked their lucky stars af­ter a garage full of bin bags left to them by a neigh­bour yielded a trove of Star Wars toys worth £400,000 (S$709,000).</p>
    <p>The cou­ple from Stour­bridge in cen­tral Eng­land were ini­tially un­sure what to make of the jumble of dolls and space­craft their neigh­bour had spent decades col­lect­ing, The Times news­pa­per re­ported on Thurs­day.</p>
    <p>Their son called in an auc­tion­eer, who found a trea­sure trove of Star Wars mem­o­ra­bilia, in­clud­ing ac­tion fig­ures still pris­tine in their sealed pack­ag­ing.</p>
    <p>“A lot of them were a bit damp be­cause of how they’ve been stored, but it’s the best Star Wars col­lec­tion I’ve ever seen,” Mr Chris As­ton, man­ag­ing di­rec­tor of As­ton’s Auc­tion­eers, told The Times.</p>
    <p>“We had a huge amount of in­ter­est from all over the world and were al­ways ex­pect­ing the sale to do very well,” Mr As­ton said of the auc­tion.</p>
    <p>Go­ing un­der the ham­mer was a Star De­stroyer Com­man­der, one of only two known ex­am­ples still to be in its orig­i­nal pack­ag­ing, which sold for £32,500 in­clud­ing fees, the Times said.</p>
    <p>A Pal­i­toy Jawa still in its pack­ag­ing – and be­lieved to be one of only 10 in ex­is­tence – fetched £27,280 with fees.</p>
    <p>A set of eight fig­ures from Re­turn Of The Jedi (1983), that cost only £1.59 each when they were bought new in the 1980s, went for £1,400.</p>
    <p>From Storm Trooper hel­mets to R2D2’s eye, mem­o­ra­bilia from one of the world’s big­gest movie fran­chises can fetch eye-wa­ter­ing sums at auc­tions.</p>
    <p>In 2015, a Luke Sky­walker doll, which hit the mar­ket in 1978 as a chil­dren’s toy, sold for US$25,000 (S$33,700) at an auc­tion or­gan­ised by Sotheby’s and eBay.</p>
    <p>Mr As­ton said the Stour­bridge cou­ple would be “thrilled” with the un­ex­pected wind­fall.</p>
    <p>“I don’t know if they have any spe­cific plans, but it must feel like they’ve won the lot­tery,” he said.</p>
