    <p>NEW YORK • Iran is send­ing its big­gest fleet yet of tankers to Venezuela in de­fi­ance of US sanc­tions to help the iso­lated na­tion weather a crip­pling fuel short­age, ac­cord­ing to peo­ple with knowl­edge of the mat­ter.</p>
    <p>Some of the flotilla of about 10 Ira­nian ves­sels will also help ex­port Venezue­lan crude af­ter dis­charg­ing fuel, the peo­ple said, ask­ing not to be named be­cause the trans­ac­tion is not pub­lic.</p>
    <p>The Ni­co­las Maduro regime is widen­ing its re­liance on Iran as an ally of last re­sort af­ter even Rus­sia and China have avoided chal­leng­ing Wash­ing­ton’s ban on trade with Venezuela.</p>
    <p>The coun­try’s fuel crunch fol­lows decades of mis­man­age­ment, cor­rup­tion and un­der-in­vest­ment</p>
    <p>MON­I­TOR­ING THE SIT­U­A­TION</p>
    <p>at state-owned Petroleos de Venezuela since the time of Mr Maduro’s late men­tor and pre­de­ces­sor, Mr Hugo Chavez.</p>
    <p>The coun­try that was once a top sup­plier of crude to the United States and boasted one of the low­est do­mes­tic petrol prices in the world now can barely pro­duce any fuel.</p>
    <p>The last Ira­nian fuel ship­ments, sent in early Oc­to­ber on three ves­sels, are run­ning out, threat­en­ing steeper na­tion­wide short­ages with hours-long queues at petrol sta­tions.</p>
    <p>The cur­rent fleet un­der sail is about dou­ble the size of the one that first star­tled in­ter­na­tional ob­servers in May, cross­ing a Caribbean Sea pa­trolled by the US Navy, to be greeted by Mr Maduro him­self upon ar­rival.</p>
    <p>“We’re watch­ing what Iran is do­ing and mak­ing sure that other ship­pers, in­sur­ers, shipown­ers, ship cap­tains re­alise they must stay away from that trade,” Mr El­liott Abrams, the US spe­cial rep­re­sen­ta­tive for Iran and Venezuela, said in Septem­ber.</p>
    <p>Sev­eral ves­sels that trans­ported fuel to Venezuela ear­lier this year, in­clud­ing For­est, For­tune and Faxon, ap­pear to be re­turn­ing to the South Amer­i­can na­tion and turned off their satel­lite sig­nals at least nine days ago, ac­cord­ing to Bloomberg tanker-track­ing data. The Zarif ap­peared to be tran­sit­ing through the Strait of Hor­muz, the data shows.</p>
    <p>Turn­ing off transpon­ders is a com­monly used method by ships hop­ing to avoid de­tec­tion.</p>
    <p>In other in­stances of Ira­nian aid to Venezuela, ship names were painted over and changed to ob­scure the ves­sel’s reg­is­tra­tion.</p>
    <p>The oil min­istry in Te­heran was not im­me­di­ately avail­able for com­ment dur­ing the Ira­nian week­end. Mes­sages sent to sev­eral of­fi­cials at PDVSA, as Venezuela’s state oil com­pany is known, also were not im­me­di­ately an­swered.</p>
    <p>In ad­di­tion to im­port­ing fuel, Venezuela also needs to ex­port enough crude oil to free up stor­age space and pre­vent field stop­pages, a task made more dif­fi­cult by the sanc­tions against Mr Maduro’s regime.</p>
    <p>Pro­duc­tion at Venezuela’s net­work of six re­finer­ies has gone into steady de­cline, with spills and ac­ci­dents be­com­ing rou­tine.</p>
    <p>Mr Maduro’s gov­ern­ment has in­creased pres­sure on the poorly main­tained in­fra­struc­ture to en­sure out­put for lo­cal con­sump­tion.</p>
    <p>Sanc­tions have made it dif­fi­cult to im­port parts or hire con­trac­tors, and the Maduro regime is run­ning out of cash.</p>
    <p>Con­se­quently, the two na­tions are also dis­cussing ways for Iran to help Venezuela over­haul its Car­don re­fin­ery, the last fuel plant there to op­er­ate more or less reg­u­larly, peo­ple with knowl­edge of the sit­u­a­tion said.</p>
    <p>In 2018, Chi­nese oil com­pa­nies also looked at help­ing Venezuela fix its re­finer­ies, but lost in­ter­est af­ter a re­view of the in­stal­la­tions, peo­ple fa­mil­iar with those plans said.</p>
    <p>We’re watch­ing what Iran is do­ing and mak­ing sure that other ship­pers, in­sur­ers, shipown­ers, ship cap­tains re­alise they must stay away from that trade.</p>
    <p>MR EL­LIOTT ABRAMS, the US spe­cial rep­re­sen­ta­tive for Iran and Venezuela, in Septem­ber.</p>
