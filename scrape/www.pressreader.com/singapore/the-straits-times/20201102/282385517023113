    <p>Sin­ga­pore stocks took a beat­ing last week amid the twin un­cer­tain­ties of the United States elec­tion and the wors­en­ing pan­demic in the West, al­most re­plac­ing Thai­land as Asia’s worst eq­uity mar­ket this year.</p>
    <p>The Straits Times In­dex (STI) fell 1.1 per cent last Fri­day, tak­ing its de­cline so far this year to 24.95 per cent, com­pared with a frac­tion­ally big­ger 24.96 per cent loss for Thai­land’s SET in­dex.</p>
    <p>The STI, which re­lies heav­ily on ex­ports, was down about 4.5 per cent last week, among the re­gion’s worst per­for­mances.</p>
    <p>A re­cov­ery in Sin­ga­pore’s stocks from the mar­ket plunge trig­gered by the pan­demic has been ham­pered by the econ­omy’s in­te­gra­tion with global trade and sup­ply chains, and a lack of tech­nol­ogy shares in the in­dex.</p>
    <p>More than 80 per cent of Sin­ga­pore’s bench­mark is made up of cycli­cal equities – the most among re­gional peers.</p>
    <p>A resur­gence in coron­avirus cases in Amer­ica and Europe and un­cer­tainty sur­round­ing stim­u­lus in the US are ex­pected to limit gains in the near term.</p>
    <p>“Sin­ga­pore is par­tic­u­larly sen­si­tive to global risk-off sen­ti­ment, and risk ap­petite has wors­ened from the resur­gence in virus cases and ex­pec­ta­tions of a slow pace of eco­nomic re­cov­ery,” said Ms Pan Jingyi, a strate­gist at IG Asia.</p>
    <p>“Some of the virus-af­fected re­gions are Sin­ga­pore’s key trad­ing part­ners.”</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore Air­lines and Com­fortDelGro are the worst per­form­ers on the in­dex so far this year – down 46 per cent and 42 per cent, re­spec­tively – af­ter the pan­demic bat­tered travel and forced peo­ple to stay home.</p>
    <p>A gloomy out­look for tourism could limit the stock mar­ket’s re-rat­ing po­ten­tial, ac­cord­ing to Mr Suresh Tan­tia, an in­vest­ment strate­gist at Credit Suisse Group.</p>
    <p>That said, val­u­a­tions are prov­ing at­trac­tive for some as the STI trades at 13 times fore­cast earn­ings for the next year, in line with its 10-year av­er­age. In com­par­i­son, the MSCI Asia Pa­cific In­dex is trad­ing at a mul­ti­ple of 16 times, much higher than its his­tor­i­cal av­er­age of 13 times.</p>
    <p>Still, the STI’s re­cov­ery has some way to go as in­vestors await a stim­u­lus pack­age in the US, said Mr Daniel Dubrovsky, an an­a­lyst at Dai­lyFX.</p>
    <p>“The Se­nate is off for re­cess un­til later this month with­out a fis­cal pack­age, crush­ing hopes of an eco­nomic boost”, which will keep the Sin­ga­pore gauge un­der pres­sure, he added.</p>
