    <p>A missed flight to Sin­ga­pore set off the chain of events that led to Bri­tish novelist Stu­art Tur­ton’s new murder mys­tery, The Devil And The Dark Wa­ter.</p>
    <p>He had been back­pack­ing around Aus­tralia in 2003 and had meant to fly out of Perth, but it turned out he had booked the wrong flight.</p>
    <p>While in limbo, he de­cided to visit the mar­itime mu­seum, where he came across the wreck­age of the Batavia, a Dutch East In­dia Com­pany mer­chant ves­sel that ran aground on a tiny is­land off the coast of West­ern Aus­tralia in 1629.</p>
    <p>One of the sur­vivors took con­trol of the oth­ers and or­ches­trated a litany of atroc­i­ties, in­clud­ing at least 100 mur­ders, be­fore res­cue came.</p>
    <p>Tur­ton was struck by the hor­ror of the story, but also by the bravery of one of the soldiers on board who led a re­sis­tance and the ship’s cap­tain, who sailed for over a month to Batavia, or present-day Jakarta, to get help.</p>
    <p>“All that hero­ism, wrapped up with all that evil, re­ally stuck with me,” says the 40-year-old over Skype from his home in Hert­ford­shire, Bri­tain.</p>
    <p>“Writ­ing my first book just de­stroyed me, and I wanted to write some­thing com­pletely dif­fer­ent.”</p>
    <p>He is re­fer­ring to his best-sell­ing de­but, The Seven Deaths Of Eve­lyn Hard­cas­tle (2018), a high-con­cept thriller set in a 1920s English manor, where the same day re­peats it­self Ground­hog Day-style, al­ways end­ing with Eve­lyn ap­pear­ing to shoot her­self at a party held in her hon­our.</p>
    <p>The pro­tag­o­nist wakes up in the body of a dif­fer­ent guest ev­ery day un­til he can iden­tify Eve­lyn’s killer and break the cy­cle. If he fails to solve the murder af­ter eight hosts, his mem­ory is wiped clean, and the process has been restarted in­nu­mer­able times.</p>
    <p>“That book was so in­tri­cately plot­ted, it drove me mad,” says Tur­ton. He had a huge spread­sheet that charted what was hap­pen­ing to each char­ac­ter ev­ery minute of the time loop and a map of the house on his bed­room wall on which to plot their move­ments.</p>
    <p>He had al­ways wanted to write a mys­tery in the style of Agatha Christie, the grande dame of crime fic­tion, but the ob­vi­ous prob­lem was that ev­ery­thing he thought of, she had al­ready done.</p>
    <p>It took him a decade to come up with the idea for Seven Deaths, at which point he was work­ing as a travel jour­nal­ist in Dubai and had to per­suade his then-girl­friend, now wife, to move back to Eng­land with him so he could work on it in the ap­pro­pri­ate at­mos­phere.</p>
    <p>The book has been op­tioned for tele­vi­sion and won the Best First Novel prize at the Costa Book Awards. Tur­ton got the news while on a train. “I wanted to scream and jump up and down, but they told me it was top se­cret, so I had to go into the train toi­let to ring my wife.”</p>
    <p>Hav­ing done a Golden Age mys­tery, he wanted to try his hand at riff­ing off an­other great de­tec­tive: Sher­lock Holmes.</p>
    <p>Tur­ton loves Christie’s nov­els un­re­servedly, but has a more com­pli­cated re­la­tion­ship with Arthur Co­nan Doyle’s leg­endary sleuth. “No­body ever seems to recog­nise that Holmes is a hor­ri­ble hu­man be­ing,” he says. “And Wat­son (his side­kick) is a lovely, clever char­ac­ter, but he’s just there to look stupid next to Sher­lock Holmes.”</p>
    <p>The Devil And The Dark Wa­ter un­folds al­most en­tirely on board a Dutch ship, the Saar­dam, which is sail­ing from Batavia to Am­s­ter­dam. Many ill omens be­gin to oc­cur at sea: the dis­ap­pear­ance of a valu­able arte­fact, the ap­pari­tion of a leper who died be­fore the voy­age be­gan and the lantern of a ghostly ship that pur­sues the Saar­dam.</p>
    <p>The novel has a Holmes-like char­ac­ter, the ge­nius de­tec­tive Sa­muel Pipps, but he spends most of the book in prison.</p>
    <p>In­stead, it is up to other pas­sen­gers, such as Pipps’s bodyguard and best friend, Lieu­tenant Arent Hayes, or Sara Wes­sel, the gov­er­nor gen­eral’s abused wife, to solve the mys­tery of the curse, even as the mur­ders come thick and fast.</p>
    <p>Un­for­tu­nately, writ­ing The Devil And The Dark Wa­ter was also an aw­ful ex­pe­ri­ence, says Tur­ton rue­fully. “I think it’s just the way I write.”</p>
    <p>He be­gan the novel two weeks af­ter his daugh­ter was born and fin­ished it just af­ter her sec­ond birth­day, jug­gling writ­ing with car­ing for a new­born. “For the first year at least, I was writ­ing words but they weren’t con­nected to each other or mak­ing any sense.”</p>
    <p>Still, he is look­ing for­ward to his next mys­tery novel, for which he might at­tempt the noir genre, in the vein of Raymond Chan­dler’s hard</p>
    <p>Bri­tish novelist Stu­art Tur­ton be­gan writ­ing The Devil And The Dark Wa­ter (above) two weeks af­ter his daugh­ter was born and fin­ished it just af­ter her sec­ond birth­day. boiled de­tec­tive Philip Mar­lowe.</p>
    <p>“I would love to write in that style, but it’s so Amer­i­can, I don’t know if I could pull it off. But I would love to try.”</p>
