    <p>With their bleached walls and uni­form doors, the two sixth-floor pub­lic rental units in Block 55 Lengkok Bahru are hardly no­tice­able.</p>
    <p>But once in­side, vis­i­tors are trans­ported to a world of vi­brant colours, full of ob­jects and images that echo the joys of child­hood.</p>
    <p>The cosy units are all decked up as part of a com­mu­nity arts ex­hi­bi­tion – Homerun – or­gan­ised by ground-up in­clu­sive arts move­ment Su­per­hero Me.</p>
    <p>Homerun fea­tures works by five young artists who all hail from the Lengkok Bahru hous­ing es­tate.</p>
    <p>Over the course of nine months, the 12-year-olds – Al­fred Goh, Brandvan Yang, Maryangell­y Jayabahan, Nur Sha­ha­nis Jo­har and Raden Rauf Radin Padli – dab­bled with photograph­y, sculpt­ing, sketch­ing and dig­i­tal art to de­pict top­ics close to their heart.</p>
    <p>These were ideas and re­al­i­ties of suc­cess, so­cial class, body con­fi­dence, bore­dom and fam­ily up­bring­ing.</p>
    <p>For the five bud­ding artists, Homerun is more than a one-off chance to show their vi­sion of child­hood. Rather, it is the cul­mi­na­tion of a six-year jour­ney with Su­per­hero Me, which pi­loted in Lengkok Bahru in 2014 as a pro­gramme for pre-school­ers from low-in­come house­holds.</p>
    <p>Since then, the move­ment has ad­vo­cated in­clu­sive­ness in art, open­ing up op­por­tu­ni­ties for in­terac</p>
    <p>tion with es­tab­lished artists and chil­dren with spe­cial needs.</p>
    <p>“Su­per­hero Me gave us the con­fi­dence to ex­plore art through dif­fer­ent projects, and helped us make friends along the way. We learnt to talk to oth­ers who were dif­fer­ent from us and never judge them,” said Maryangell­y, a Gan Eng Seng Pri­mary School pupil.</p>
    <p>“Though putting to­gether this ex­hi­bi­tion was hard at first, I am proud of my work, and ner­vous about what the fu­ture will bring.”</p>
    <p>Her ex­hibit, Will You Suc­ceed In Life?, fea­tures a mu­ral of a colour­ful, in­ter­ac­tive flow chart ex­plor­ing var­i­ous pos­i­tive and neg­a­tive ac­tions that guide view­ers to dif­fer­ent con­clu­sions re­gard­ing suc­cess in one’s life.</p>
    <p>The work em­bod­ies Maryangell­y’s drive to make a bet­ter life for her­self. Draw­ing on the guid­ance of her mother, who works as a pantry lady, and de­liv­ery­man fa­ther, she strives to be a high achiever, even tak­ing up Chi­nese in school, so she can have more job op­por­tu­ni­ties in the fu­ture.</p>
    <p>Brandvan, also from Gan Eng Seng Pri­mary School, used his</p>

    <p>MARYANGELL­Y JAYABAHAN</p>
    <p>ex­hibit – A Diet Of Con­fi­dence – to por­tray how ap­pear­ance is linked to abil­ity.</p>
    <p>Grow­ing up with eczema, he faced emo­tional stress, pain and bul­ly­ing when­ever his con­di­tion flared up.</p>
    <p>Through a col­lec­tion of clay and plas­ter sculp­tures set in a kitchen, he brings to life crus­taceans and peanuts, things he is al­ler­gic to, as well as a sculpted form of his hands. He chose to de­pict his hands as they en­able him to do things he loves, like play­ing video games or car­ing for his cat.</p>
    <p>“Life is more than what peo­ple say about you. Don’t judge too quickly be­fore you get to know some­one,” he said.</p>
    <p>Pre­sented by the Lien Foun­da­tion, the ex­hi­bi­tion is sup­ported by the Na­tional Arts Coun­cil, with venue sup­port from the Hous­ing Board. It is open to vis­i­tors by ap­point­ment till Dec 19. Tick­ets can be pur­chased on­line for week­end tours. The pub­lic can also make group book­ings for week­days.</p>
    <p>Each guided tour lasts an hour, with var­i­ous time slots avail­able, capped at five per­sons per tour with safety mea­sures in place. More in­for­ma­tion can be found at www.su­per­herome.sg/homerun</p>
    <p>A dig­i­tal ex­hi­bi­tion of the works will be avail­able from Dec 1.</p>
