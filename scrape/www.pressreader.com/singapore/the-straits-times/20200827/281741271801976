    <p>The Min­istry of Health (MOH) yes­ter­day an­nounced up­dated bor­der mea­sures for trav­ellers ar­riv­ing from the Repub­lic of Korea.</p>
    <p>Those en­ter­ing Sin­ga­pore from Satur­day, who in the last 14 days have trav­elled to South Korea, in­clud­ing for tran­sit, will be re­quired to serve a 14-day stay-home no­tice (SHN) at ded­i­cated fa­cil­i­ties in­stead of their own place of res­i­dence. They will also need to un­dergo a Covid-19 test be­fore the end of the SHN, as is the cur­rent re­quire­ment, the min­istry said.</p>
    <p>Be­fore the new mea­sure, trav­ellers from “low-risk” re­gions and coun­tries, which pre­vi­ously included South Korea, were al­lowed to serve their 14-day SHN in their homes from June 18.</p>
    <p>The change comes amid news out of South Korea of clus­ters of</p>
    <p>Covid-19 in­fec­tions at work­places af­ter out­breaks at places of wor­ship.</p>
    <p>In its state­ment yes­ter­day, MOH said: “The au­thor­i­ties in the Repub­lic of Korea have warned of a pos­si­ble na­tion­wide out­break. Across the Repub­lic of Korea, stricter so­cial dis­tanc­ing mea­sures have been im­posed.”</p>
    <p>South Korea had on Tues­day or­dered most schools in Seoul and the sur­round­ing ar­eas to close and move classes back on­line, the lat­est in a series of pre­cau­tion­ary mea­sures aimed at head­ing off a resur­gence in coro­n­avirus cases.</p>
    <p>The change in Sin­ga­pore’s pol­icy on SHNs for per­sons re­turn­ing from South Korea is in line with the multi-min­istry task force’s ef­forts, where bor­der mea­sures are cal­i­brated based on the as­sessed risk of im­por­ta­tion and on­ward trans­mis­sion in the com­mu­nity.</p>
    <p>At the task force’s vir­tual press con­fer­ence last Fri­day – where it was an­nounced that gen­eral travel to and from Brunei and New Zealand will be al­lowed from Sept 1 – task force co-chair and Ed­u­ca­tion Min­is­ter Lawrence Wong said trav­ellers to Sin­ga­pore will be cat­e­gorised into three groups.</p>
    <p>They are: those who do not have to serve a stay-home no­tice; trav­ellers who can serve a shorter stay-home no­tice at their own place of res­i­dence; and vis­i­tors who must serve the usual 14-day pe­riod at a ded­i­cated fa­cil­ity.</p>
    <p>“The coun­tries in the dif­fer­ent cat­e­gories will con­tinue to be up­dated over time... We con­tinue to as­sess the sit­u­a­tion and we will up­date the list over time,” he said.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, de­spite Sin­ga­pore’s lift­ing of re­stric­tions on travel to Brunei and New Zealand, the two coun­tries’ bor­ders have re­mained closed to vis­i­tors as of yes­ter­day.</p>
