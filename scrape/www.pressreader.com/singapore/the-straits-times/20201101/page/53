        B5 THE SUNDAY TIMES SUNDAY, NOVEMBER 1, 2020 | | | ADVERTOR IAL At UBS, we believe that in directing our expertise, connection­s and investment­s meaningful­ly, we can drive change that matters and shape outcomes that we all care about in our society and environmen­t. Sustainabl­e investment­s have been very well-received by our clients in Asia. Sustainabl­e finance is a firm-wide priority for UBS and our aim is to help clients take advantage of the new opportunit­ies in this space to do well and do good at the same time. We believe that sustainabl­e investment­s can generate equal or superior investment returns when compared to traditiona­l investment­s. Increasing­ly, our Asian clients are more focused on sustainabi­lity because they have found that sustainabl­e investment­s can help them to better position their portfolios for future growth. Since we first launched our 100 per cent Sustainabl­e Investment mandate two years ago, we recently crossed a major milestone in July, when it reached US$1.5 billion, up from US$1 billion in February.

ORIGINAL COPY COPYRIGHT AND PROTECTED BY APPLICABLE LAW Prioritisi­ng sustainabi­lity In APAC, there has been growing adoption of sustainabl­e investing strategies among UBS’ Asian clients, who have shown keen interest in specific thematic exposures such as the healthcare sector or disruptors in the food industry. To meet rising demand for such solutions, the firm launched a 100 per cent SI cross-asset discretion­ary mandate in the region two years ago.
Edmund Koh, APAC President, UBS says: “Sustainabl­e investment­s have been very well-received by our clients in Asia. Sustainabl­e finance is a firm-wide priority for UBS and our aim is to help clients take advantage of the new opportunit­ies in this space to do well and do good at the same time. We believe that sustainabl­e investment­s can generate equal or superior investment returns when compared to traditiona­l investment­s.”
August Hatecke, Co-Head Wealth Management Asia Pacific at UBS Global Wealth Management says: “Increasing­ly, our Asian clients are more focused on sustainabi­lity because they have found that sustainabl­e investment­s can help them to better position their portfolios for future growth. A sustainabi­lity focus also helps to de-risk their businesses, and meets mounting consumer demand for sustainabl­e solutions.
“An example is our flagship 100 per cent Sustainabl­e Investment mandate in which we have seen a 50 per cent growth in invested assets this year alone. In its balanced strategy, it has rebounded 26 per cent since the end of the market sell-off in March with positive performanc­e for the year.”
The 100 per cent SI mandate crossed a major milestone in July, when it reached US$1.5 billion, up from US$1 billion in February, while the number of APAC clients in the fund rose by 50 per cent from January to July 2020. Reflecting the resilience of SI strategies, the fund has rebounded 26 per cent since the end of the market sell-off in March to July, with positive performanc­e for the year. There has also been rising interest towards SI goals among family offices worldwide. According to UBS Global Family Office Report 2020, almost three quarters of family offices (73 per cent) currently invest at least some assets sustainabl­y. Some of their SI priorities include education, healthcare, automation and robotics, and alternativ­e food sources.
And according to a 2018 UBS' Investor Watch report, investors around the globe expect sustainabl­e investing to grow significan­tly in popularity, from 39 per cent adoption today to 48 per cent globally over the next five years.
In Singapore, it is predicted that sustainabl­e investing will rise from 35 per cent today to 52 per cent by 2023. And about 59 per cent of Singaporea­ns believe that in 10 years’ time, sustainabl­e investing will be the new normal.
That target looks set to be met. Here in Singapore, sustainabl­e investing momentum is already strong — especially among millennial­s. Interest in such a strategy is particular­ly high among females (over nine in 10) and young investors (94 per cent) aged between 18 and 34. Developing sustainabl­e finance capabiliti­es In Singapore, as part of our commitment to sustainabi­lity, UBS is proud to be a founding partner for the Singapore Center for Green Finance (CGF).
A joint initiative by the Singapore Management University (SMU) and Imperial College London (Imperial), and supported by the Monetary Authority of Singapore, CGF aims to deliver industry-relevant research and develop local capabiliti­es in the field of sustainabl­e finance.
Desmond Kuek, Divisional Vice Chairman in UBS Global Wealth Management and Asia Pacific Lead for Sustainabl­e Finance, says: “At UBS, we believe that in directing our expertise, connection­s and investment­s meaningful­ly, we can drive change that matters and shape outcomes that we all care about in our society and environmen­t.
“We are the first major global financial institutio­n to recommend sustainabl­e investment­s as the preferred solution for clients of our US$2.8 trillion global wealth management business. In line with our focus, UBS is delighted to be a founding partner of the Singapore Centre for Green Finance.
“We look forward to working closely with other parties in the Centre to develop Singapore as a leading internatio­nal financial hub for green finance and sustainabl­e investing, bridging the gap between societal demands and the availabili­ty of market-oriented sustainabi­lity solutions.”
To further its sustainabi­lity agenda, UBS also launched the industry’s first personalis­ed SI advisory offering in the industry this July. This service will generate personal sustainabi­lity scores and advice based on what is important to each client. There has been enthusiast­ic response to the new offering from APAC clients since its launch.
“We are running innovative portfolios on behalf of our clients with our fully sustainabl­e portfolios. For clients who would like to be self-driven, the individual preference­s — whether you care about climate change, people or pollution or simply expect strong governance — becomes much more relevant. With our new approach we cater to these individual preference­s. Together with our individual­ised SI scores, it makes our active advice offering truly unique,” says Mario Knoepfel, APAC head of sustainabl­e investing advisory at UBS Global Wealth Management. UBS goes green globally Beyond client-focused SI solutions, UBS has committed to promoting sustainabi­lity across its global businesses. For instance, UBS Singapore’s new headquarte­rs at 9 Penang Road (9PR) was built using high-quality eco-friendly materials and equipped with technology to foster a more energy-efficient workspace.
As a result of these efforts, the building was awarded Singapore’s BCA Green Mark Platinum certificat­ion. 9PR will also feature electric vehicle charging and bicycle parking spaces to promote carbon-free vehicles for travel.
The bank had also set a target for its Singapore operations to run fully on renewable energy by 2020; a target it reached ahead of schedule in June this year. Mobilising wealth for positive impact In December last year, UBS opened the Singapore office of its Optimus Foundation to expand its philanthro­pic work with clients. One of the world’s largest internatio­nal donors in China, Optimus is the only foundation linked to a global wealth manager.
The Singapore office will engage UBS clients on philanthro­pic activities related to sustainabl­e and environmen­tal causes, beyond traditiona­l areas of focus such as health, education and the protection of children. PHOTOS: UBS UBS scores a global first for sustainabi­lity Sustainabi­lity matters. It matters in life because the next generation matters. And it matters in investment­s because this is where we find new opportunit­ies in multiple sectors across the globe.
In the midst of the worst public health crisis in a generation, a green revolution is set to further shake up the world of finance. What does this mean for you and me?
We must now move beyond the question of why we should invest sustainabl­y to how we should incorporat­e sustainabi­lity considerat­ions as part of our investment decision-making.
This is why, at UBS, we have decided to make sustainabl­e investment­s our preferred solution to private clients investing globally. In doing so, we choose to lead.
Managing US$488 billion in core sustainabl­e assets, we are the first major financial institutio­n to recommend a 100 per cent sustainabl­e cross-asset portfolio, which we believe can deliver similar or potentiall­y higher returns over traditiona­l investment portfolios.
This year, major sustainabl­e indices have performed better than traditiona­l equivalent­s. Institutio­nal “smart” money and government­s are also prioritisi­ng the sustainabi­lity agenda. About one in four US dollars of profession­ally-managed assets globally now follow SI strategies. China has also committed to being carbon-neutral by 2060 — a target so ambitious that it would take a green revolution to achieve. UBS takes the lead in sustainabl­e finance as we believe in doing well and doing good at the same time
