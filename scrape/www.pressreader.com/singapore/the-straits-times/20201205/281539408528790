    <p>Although there is noth­ing wrong with high­light­ing Sin­ga­pore’s achieve­ments, of­fi­cials should not fear dis­cussing fail­ures too. Fac­ing up to one’s short­com­ings is usu­ally more pro­duc­tive, says editor-at-large Han Fook Kwang.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore has done well con­trol­ling the spread of Covid-19.</p>
    <p>There have been only a hand­ful of com­mu­nity cases in re­cent months, with the rest be­ing im­ported cases. Com­pared with many coun­tries in Europe, the United States and parts of Asia, this has been quite an achieve­ment.</p>
    <p>Though you can­not rule out a fu­ture out­break, and bar­ring one, there are hope­ful signs of a pos­si­ble turn­around in the econ­omy, which has been rav­aged by the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Econ­o­mists have forecast pos­i­tive growth next year, and for­eign in­vest­ments con­tinue to flow in, with some of the best known names in the world ex­pand­ing their work or start­ing op­er­a­tions here, in­clud­ing Dyson, Twit­ter, PayPal and ByteDance, which owns TikTok.</p>
    <p>In a dis­rupted and un­cer­tain world, busi­nesses look for a safe, sta­ble and con­ducive en­vi­ron­ment. The for­mula might be old but, glob­ally, there are new cus­tomers drawn by its re­newed rel­e­vance in a chang­ing world.</p>
    <p>Tak­ing ev­ery­thing in, Sin­ga­pore is not in a bad spot – not yet out of the woods but re­al­is­ti­cally con­fi­dent that, pro­vided there is not an­other cri­sis to de­rail re­cov­ery, next year should be bet­ter than this.</p>
    <p>But though the story so far has been hope­ful, there are se­ri­ous long-term is­sues that need ad­dress­ing, in­clud­ing the low birth rate, how to wean com­pa­nies off cheap for­eign labour, low pro­duc­tiv­ity in many sec­tors of the econ­omy and the in­equal­ity and class dif­fer­ences that threaten to di­vide the na­tion.</p>
    <p>Any ac­count of how Sin­ga­pore is do­ing has to ad­dress these is­sues.</p>
    <p>Hence, I found it jar­ring to read a re­cently re­leased re­port by the Pub­lic Ser­vice called Sin­ga­pore Pub­lic Sec­tor Out­comes Re­view, a bi­en­nial record of how the coun­try has fared.</p>
    <p>As a doc­u­ment list­ing what the Gov­ern­ment has done to make life bet­ter for Sin­ga­pore­ans in key ar­eas such as ed­u­ca­tion, hous­ing, health­care and the work­place, as well as in the arts and en­ter­tain­ment, it is com­pre­hen­sive and well pre­sented.</p>
    <p>But I have a prob­lem with the way it de­scribes what has been achieved, mak­ing it sound as if it has all the an­swers and that life here was hunky-dory for ev­ery­one.</p>
    <p>Here is how it sum­marises how Sin­ga­pore­ans were do­ing at the be­gin­ning of the re­port:</p>
    <p>“Sin­ga­pore­ans – both young and old – can look for­ward to a good and ful­fill­ing life. Life­long learn­ing and skills mas­tery are en­abled by a con­tin­u­ously im­prov­ing ed­u­ca­tion sys­tem and Skill­sFu­ture. Our peo­ple re­main re­silient and com­pet­i­tive in the work­force, able to tap new job op­por­tu­ni­ties, as­sisted by Adapt and Grow and other em­ploy­ment sup­port schemes as well as ini­tia­tives to en­sure fair con­sid­er­a­tion for Sin­ga­porean job seek­ers. Sus­tained so­cial in­vest­ment and tar­geted so­cial safety nets make sure no one is left be­hind.”</p>
    <p>If you were char­i­ta­ble, you might say this rep­re­sents the most gen­er­ous and op­ti­mistic view of how the coun­try was do­ing.</p>
    <p>But as a re­port on what was hap­pen­ing on the ground, it ought to have been more bal­anced and rounded. For ex­am­ple, how did the civil ser­vice come to speak on be­half of all Sin­ga­pore­ans – both young and old – that they are able to lead good and ful­fill­ing lives? What about those strug­gling to make ends meet, out of jobs, in poor health, and without fam­ily sup­port?</p>
    <p>What has been the ex­pe­ri­ence of work­ers with those life­long learn­ing schemes? How many have achieved the skills mas­tery needed to get the jobs they want?</p>
    <p>Are Sin­ga­pore work­ers as re­silient and com­pet­i­tive as stated in the re­port? What is the as­sess­ment from em­ploy­ers?</p>
    <p>Has no one re­ally been left be­hind?</p>
    <p>What are the views of the 100,000 Sin­ga­pore­ans earn­ing be­low $1,300 a month, the barest amount nec­es­sary for the most ba­sic daily needs?</p>
    <p>One other ex­am­ple of its se­lec­tive re­port­ing: In high­light­ing Sin­ga­pore’s re­cy­cling achieve­ment, it cited only one num­ber – 99 per cent of metal, con­struc­tion and de­mo­li­tion waste is re­cy­cled.</p>
    <p>That’s al­most a per­fect score.</p>
    <p>But out­side of the con­struc­tion in­dus­try, which is re­quired by the Build­ing and Con­struc­tion Au­thor­ity to re­cy­cle its waste, Sin­ga­pore has a fail­ing grade.</p>
    <p>Only 22 per cent of house­hold waste is re­cy­cled, far be­low that of many other de­vel­oped economies such as Ger­many and Tai­wan, which achieve rates of more than 50 per cent.</p>
    <p>In fact, the sit­u­a­tion is even worse than the num­ber sug­gests be­cause 40 per cent of the re­cy­cled ma­te­rial can­not be used as it is con­tam­i­nated with food and liq­uids.</p>
    <p>But you will not find any of these num­bers in the re­port.</p>
    <p>When the au­thors are so se­lec­tive in what they choose to high­light and seem so in­tent on giv­ing a good ac­count of their work, you have to won­der about the other num­bers cited.</p>
    <p>This is a pity be­cause many of Sin­ga­pore’s achieve­ments as listed in the re­view are out­stand­ing – in health­care, home own­er­ship, em­ploy­ment and ed­u­ca­tion – and Sin­ga­pore­ans should be proud of them.</p>
    <p>Per­haps I am read­ing too much into the re­port, but as it is writ­ten by a ser­vice that is recog­nised as one of the best in the world for its in­tegrity and per­for­mance, I think we should ex­pect it to do bet­ter.</p>
    <p>If the is­sue is only about pre­sen­ta­tion and writ­ing style, I would not worry too much.</p>
    <p>My big­ger con­cern is about at­ti­tudes and mind­set, and how Sin­ga­pore’s chal­lenges are com­mu­ni­cated to the pub­lic.</p>
    <p>I be­lieve it has un­der­gone quite a change and has swung from one ex­treme to the other in the space of sev­eral decades.</p>
    <p>In the early years of Sin­ga­pore’s in­de­pen­dence, the talk from the top was mainly about how poorly the coun­try was do­ing and why it should pull up its socks.</p>
    <p>Work­ers were reg­u­larly told that their pro­duc­tiv­ity lev­els were Third World, man­agers were lec­tured on how they paled in com­par­i­son with their Ja­panese or Ger­man coun­ter­parts, and even the civil ser­vice was scolded pub­licly for be­ing in­dif­fer­ent to the stan­dards ex­pected.</p>
    <p>In ef­fect, Sin­ga­pore­ans heard the con­stant re­frain from their lead­ers that they were mid­dling at best and that at this rate they would not make it as a na­tion.</p>
    <p>Im­prove or per­ish!</p>
    <p>Slowly, over the years, the tone and sub­stance of pub­lic com­mu­ni­ca­tion changed.</p>
    <p>To­day, you are more likely to hear pub­lic agen­cies high­light­ing their ac­com­plish­ments and down­play­ing prob­lems.</p>
    <p>As a mem­ber of sev­eral statu­tory boards over the years, I have found this to be quite per­va­sive. They are all well run, with high stan­dards of pro­fes­sion­al­ism, but there is a ten­dency for man­age­ment to be one-sided when re­view­ing its work, even to board mem­bers.</p>
    <p>There is noth­ing wrong with re­port­ing one’s achieve­ments, but you have to bal­ance it with your short­com­ings. What haven’t you achieved, and why?</p>
    <p>But of­fi­cials are of­ten un­com­fort­able talk­ing about fail­ure and have not learnt how to do so hon­estly and con­struc­tively.</p>
    <p>Talk­ing about fail­ure is usu­ally more pro­duc­tive and re­sults in a richer dis­cus­sion of the is­sues than high­light­ing suc­cess.</p>
    <p>It also builds greater em­pa­thy with peo­ple, es­pe­cially those not do­ing well and can iden­tify with the prob­lems and is­sues be­ing raised.</p>
    <p>Con­versely, if too rosy a pic­ture is be­ing pre­sented, lead­ers might be seen as de­tached and out of touch.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore needs to re­tune the way it talks about the coun­try, its suc­cesses and fail­ures.</p>
    <p>It should not be too dif­fi­cult as that was how it was done not too long ago.</p>
