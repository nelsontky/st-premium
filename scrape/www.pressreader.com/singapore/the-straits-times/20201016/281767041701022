    <p>In­done­sia has taken over from the Philip­pines as South-east Asia’s new pan­demic hot spot as of yes­ter­day as it strug­gles to con­tain surg­ing Covid-19 in­fec­tions, with fresh cases hit­ting 4,000 a day.</p>
    <p>With 4,411 new cases in the past 24 hours, the tally in the world’s fourth-most pop­u­lous nation hit 349,160 yes­ter­day – the high­est in South-east Asia. There have been 12,268 deaths, also the high­est in the re­gion.</p>
    <p>The Philip­pines re­ported 2,261 new cases, rais­ing its to­tal to 348,698.</p>
    <p>In­done­sia sur­passed Sin­ga­pore as the coun­try with the most num­ber of coro­n­avirus in­fec­tions in the re­gion on June 17, a po­si­tion it re­tained un­til Aug 6, when the Philip­pines took over.</p>
    <p>The coun­try has seen a faster growth in in­fec­tions in the past few months, as large-scale so­cial re­stric­tions were eased in many parts of the vast ar­chi­pel­ago from June to give some re­prieve to an econ­omy bat­tered by the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>South-east Asia’s big­gest econ­omy is on the brink of a re­ces­sion.</p>
    <p>The cap­i­tal Jakarta went into a sec­ond par­tial lock­down on Sept 14 in a last-ditch at­tempt to con­tain rapidly surg­ing coro­n­avirus cases.</p>
    <p>The lift­ing of the re­stric­tions started on Mon­day.</p>
    <p>The gov­ern­ment has blamed the surge on peo­ple’s fail­ure to com­ply with health pro­to­cols such as wear­ing masks and so­cial dis­tanc­ing, but crit­ics say the au­thor­i­ties have pri­ori­tised re­sus­ci­tat­ing the econ­omy over tack­ling the pan­demic prop­erly.</p>
    <p>In the Philip­pines, with fewer Covid-19 cases sur­fac­ing, the gov­ern­ment has been eas­ing quar­an­tine re­stric­tions to speed up the re­open­ing of an econ­omy that is al­ready in deep re­ces­sion, de­spite warn­ings from ex­perts that this could lead to a surge in in­fec­tions.</p>
    <p>It is al­low­ing com­muters to sit closer to­gether when tak­ing pub­lic trans­port, and more busi­nesses can now op­er­ate at full ca­pac­ity. Teens and those aged 61 to 65 are also now al­lowed to go out of their homes.</p>
    <p>The coun­try’s Covid-19 task force head Car­l­ito Galvez noted that the num­ber of cases in the Philip­pines has been fall­ing be­cause of “a change of be­hav­iour” among Filipinos, re­fer­ring to their con­sis­tent habit of wear­ing masks and face shields as well as keep­ing a safe dis­tance while out­side.</p>
    <p>How­ever, ex­perts from the Oc­taUP re­search team at the state-run Univer­sity of the Philip­pines voiced con­cern that cases in Metro Manila – the cap­i­tal re­gion – and in seven prov­inces have re­cently been spik­ing. They warned that a surge seems in­evitable.</p>
    <p>“As the na­tional gov­ern­ment de­cides to fur­ther ex­pand eco­nomic ac­tiv­ity all over the coun­try, the re­al­ity of a surge in vi­ral trans­mis­sions will not be a ques­tion of if, but of when and by how much,” the re­search team said in a re­port.</p>
    <p>In In­done­sia, the au­thor­i­ties have stepped up ef­forts to se­cure vac­cines to tackle the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Bri­tish phar­ma­ceu­ti­cal com­pany As­traZeneca has com­mit­ted to pro­vid­ing In­done­sia with 100 mil­lion doses of Covid-19 vac­cines, In­done­sian For­eign Min­is­ter Retno Mar­sudi said in London on Wed­nes­day.</p>
    <p>Un­der the gov­ern­ment’s lat­est plan, In­done­sia seeks to vac­ci­nate 160 mil­lion of its nearly 270 mil­lion pop­u­la­tion against the coro­n­avirus by the end of next year.</p>
    <p>The pri­or­ity of vac­ci­na­tion will be given to peo­ple aged 19 to 59 and front-line work­ers such as health­care staff, po­lice and mil­i­tary of­fi­cers, Co­or­di­nat­ing Min­is­ter for Eco­nomic Af­fairs Air­langga Har­tarto said on Oct 2.</p>
    <p>State-owned vac­cine pro­ducer Bio Farma is con­duct­ing the fi­nal­stage clin­i­cal tri­als of a vac­cine de­vel­oped by Chi­nese bio­phar­ma­ceu­ti­cal com­pany Si­novac Biotech, and the com­pany aims to com­mence vac­cine pro­duc­tion in Jan­uary.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, Jakarta-based drug pro­ducer Kalbe Farma, which is work­ing with South Korea’s Genex­ine on another vac­cine can­di­date, is set to carry out its sec­ond-phase trial for ef­fi­cacy and dose range in In­done­sia next month, its pres­i­dent direc­tor Vid­jongtius told The Straits Times yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>But Dr Pandu Riono, an epi­demi­ol­o­gist from the Univer­sity of In­done­sia, ques­tioned the gov­ern­ment’s rush to se­cure vac­cines as the key so­lu­tion to han­dle the pan­demic. Vac­cines must serve as “a long-term so­lu­tion” and be­come part of a strate­gic plan in han­dling the pan­demic and its im­pact over the next five years, he said.</p>
    <p>In the mean­time, the gov­ern­ment must re­main fo­cused on low­er­ing the num­ber of cases by in­ten­si­fy­ing sur­veil­lance, in­clud­ing con­tact trac­ing, and chang­ing peo­ple’s be­hav­iour, as im­ple­mented by its neigh­bours such as Thai­land and Viet­nam, Dr Pandu added.</p>
    <p>“The pan­demic mostly af­fects re­gions in Java and big cities like Jakarta. If we can ap­ply (the meth­ods) well, we can push down the fig­ure of in­fec­tions.”</p>
    <p>In­done­sia has seen a faster growth in in­fec­tions in the past few months, as large-scale so­cial re­stric­tions were eased in many parts of the vast ar­chi­pel­ago from June to give some re­prieve to an econ­omy bat­tered by the pan­demic.</p>
