    <p>•</p>
    <p>A Covid-19 vac­cine de­vel­oped by Chi­nese phar­ma­ceu­ti­cal firm Si­no­vac Biotech was found to be more than 50 per cent ef­fec­tive in a Brazil­ian clin­i­cal trial, though re­searchers de­layed re­leas­ing more in­for­ma­tion at the re­quest of the com­pany.</p>
    <p>A 50 per cent ef­fi­cacy rate is a min­i­mum stan­dard set by United States reg­u­la­tors for emer­gency au­tho­ri­sa­tion of Covid-19 vac­cines.</p>
    <p>Mes­sen­ger RNA vac­cines from Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech have pro­duced far bet­ter re­sults, re­duc­ing symp­to­matic Covid-19 cases by well over 90 per cent in tri­als.</p>
    <p>Chi­nese vac­cine devel­op­ers have been slow com­pared with their Western peers in re­leas­ing ef­fi­cacy data on their shots.</p>
    <p>As mil­lions of healthy peo­ple count on trans­parency in tri­als be­fore tak­ing a shot, the lack of more spe­cific re­sults from Si­no­vac’s trial risks erod­ing con­fi­dence in vac­cines from China.</p>
    <p>Hong Kong has said res­i­dents will be al­lowed to choose which shot they want to take among sev­eral can­di­dates that will likely in­clude Si­no­vac.</p>
    <p>The lack of trans­parency in re­port­ing the Brazil trial re­sults “is to­tally un­ac­cept­able”, and would not pass muster in the US, said Dr Eric</p>
    <p>Topol, a clin­i­cal tri­als ex­pert and di­rec­tor of the Scripps Re­search Trans­la­tional In­sti­tute.</p>
    <p>A spokesman said ear­lier this week that the com­pany could dis­close ef­fi­cacy data only af­ter they are re­viewed by Chi­nese reg­u­la­tors.</p>
    <p>The late-stage trial of Si­no­vac’s vac­cine in Brazil, in­volv­ing about 13,000 par­tic­i­pants, sug­gested that the shot is “safe and ef­fec­tive”, the au­thor­i­ties at the Bu­tan­tan In­sti­tute and from the state of Sao Paulo said.</p>
    <p>They were asked not to dis­sem­i­nate the in­for­ma­tion un­til it was thor­oughly re­viewed in China as part of a con­trac­tual agree­ment.</p>
    <p>“Our goal was for the shot to be more than 50 per cent ef­fec­tive,” said Sao Paulo state’s Health Sec­re­tary Jean Gor­inchteyn. “A vac­cine that reaches at least that is al­ready cause for cel­e­bra­tion.”</p>
    <p>The group that re­ceived the vac­cine in Brazil’s trial had no se­vere cases of Covid-19, and the main side ef­fect re­ported was mild pain at the in­jec­tion site, said Dr Di­mas Co­vas, head of Bu­tan­tan. Ef­fi­cacy is above the thresh­old needed for a vac­cine to be reg­is­tered by Brazil’s health reg­u­la­tor known as An­visa, which still has to ap­prove the shot.</p>
    <p>Mr Gor­inchteyn said Si­no­vac’s re</p>
    <p>view of the data is slated to take within 15 days or less, and should not de­lay the planned Jan 25 start of in­oc­u­la­tions.</p>
    <p>“Si­no­vac has sev­eral on­go­ing tri­als, and it’s im­por­tant (they give) the data con­sis­tency,” Dr Co­vas</p>
    <p>said. “The com­pany can’t an­a­lyse data from the same vac­cine us­ing dif­fer­ent cri­te­ria, and can’t have three dif­fer­ent ef­fi­cacy rates for the same vac­cine.”</p>
    <p>Si­no­vac is also run­ning tri­als in In­done­sia and Tur­key.</p>
    <p>Si­no­vac is bet­ting on a suc­cess­ful vac­cine to in­oc­u­late more peo­ple around the world, es­pe­cially in de­vel­op­ing coun­tries such as Brazil that will have lim­ited ac­cess to the Pfizer and Moderna shots.</p>
    <p>Si­no­vac’s shot is also po­ten­tially</p>
    <p>more suited to de­vel­op­ing na­tions as it can be kept at nor­mal re­frig­er­a­tor tem­per­a­tures, com­pared with the vac­cines from Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna which need mi­nus 70 deg C con­di­tions for stor­age and trans­porta­tion.</p>
