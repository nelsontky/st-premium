    <p>SEOUL • Hyundai Motor is re­view­ing whether to ex­pand a re­call of its Kona elec­tric ve­hi­cle (EV) glob­ally fol­low­ing mul­ti­ple re­ports of bat­tery fires.</p>
    <p>The South Korean au­tomaker said in an e-mailed state­ment yes­ter­day that it was in the fi­nal stages of fil­ing a re­call no­tice with the US Na­tional High­way Traf­fic Safety Ad­min­is­tra­tion and was con­sid­er­ing ex­pand­ing the vol­un­tary re­call world­wide.</p>
    <p>The is­sue comes as Hyundai bids for a greater share of the mar­ket for fuel-free cars. Other EV mak­ers, in­clud­ing Tesla, Porsche, NIO and Audi, have also had re­calls and in­ves­ti­ga­tions in the past due to po­ten­tial fire risks with their ve­hi­cles.</p>
    <p>Hyundai said it “is in­ves­ti­gat­ing if Kona Elec­tric with over­seas spec­i­fi­ca­tions re­quires a safety re­call, and will an­nounce re­calls re­gion­ally or by a coun­try, work­ing closely with the lo­cal au­thor­i­ties”.</p>
    <p>South Korean news agency Yon­hap re­ported ear­lier yes­ter­day that Hyundai will re­call 77,000 Kona EVs world­wide. It cited in­dus­try in­sid­ers as say­ing the af­fected ve­hi­cles were pro­duced be­tween Septem­ber 2017 and March this year.</p>
    <p>The re­call comes af­ter 13 cases of Kona EVs catch­ing fire have been re­ported since 2018, ac­cord­ing to Yon­hap. One of the in­ci­dents was in the South Korean city of Daegu, where a Kona ve­hi­cle parked in an un­der­ground lot caught fire.</p>
    <p>Kona EVs will be re­called i n South Korea be­gin­ning on Fri­day, af­fect­ing 25,564 ve­hi­cles.</p>
    <p>The South Korean au­thor­i­ties said dam­age in a bat­tery sep­a­ra­tor posed a fire risk, though bat­tery sup­plier LG Chem de­nied there was a de­fect. LG said it is jointly in­ves­ti­gat­ing the cause of the fires with Hyundai.</p>
    <p>Hyundai’s shares fell as much as 2.5 per cent yes­ter­day, while LG Chem dropped 2.89 per cent.</p>
    <p>There are 226 Hyundai Kona Elec­tric cars reg­is­tered in Sin­ga­pore – 200 by Grab, two taxis and 24 by in­di­vid­u­als.</p>
    <p>Tesla said an i so­lated bat­tery fault caused a Model S to catch fire in a Shang­hai park­ing lot last year. There have been re­ports of the same model catch­ing fire in Hong Kong. In Fe­bru­ary this year, Porsche said one of its new Tay­can elec­tric cars caught fire in a garage of a US cus­tomer, while Audi last year re­called an EV sold in the US, cit­ing risks of bat­tery fire.</p>
