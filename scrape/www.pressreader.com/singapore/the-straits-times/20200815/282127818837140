    <p>Be­fore the Covid-19 cri­sis es­ca­lated, my fam­ily planned a hol­i­day and the tour agency we used con­firmed our tour pack­age a week be­fore the de­par­ture date, and got us to pay up the bal­ance sum for my fam­ily of four.</p>
    <p>How­ever, in mid-March, two days be­fore our flight de­par­ture date, the agency called to say the trip had been can­celled.</p>
    <p>As set­tle­ment, it gave us two op­tions: have our pay­ment re­funded in cash but with a de­duc­tion of $75 per per­son as ad­min­is­tra­tive charges or ac­cept a credit voucher for fu­ture travel with them.</p>
    <p>As the cri­sis was wors­en­ing, we de­cided out of pru­dence that we should take a break from travel for a year or two.</p>
    <p>We con­veyed our in­ten­tion to go for the re­fund but with­out the $75 ad­min­is­tra­tive fee de­duc­tion as it was the tour agency that can­celled the trip, not us.</p>
    <p>Last week, after a five-month de­lay, the tour agency got back to us and made the set­tle­ment of­fer of the re­fund mi­nus the ad­min­is­tra­tive fees. It seems we had no choice but to agree to this un­jus­ti­fied de­duc­tion.</p>
    <p>Are these travel agen­cies ac­count­able to any­one? Do they not have rules that they need to abide by in their op­er­a­tions?</p>
    <p>Could the rel­e­vant agency com­ment? I am sure there are many other cus­tomers of tour agen­cies who are in the same sit­u­a­tion as my fam­ily. Chew Boon Yeow</p>
