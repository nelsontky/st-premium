    <p>•</p>
    <p>WASH­ING­TON The US State Depart­ment is ter­mi­nat­ing five Chi­nese-funded ex­change pro­grammes with the United States, call­ing them pro­pa­ganda tools for Bei­jing.</p>
    <p>The depart­ment said on its web­site that the pro­grammes are the Pol­i­cy­mak­ers Ed­u­ca­tional China Trip Pro­gramme, the US-China Friend­ship Pro­gramme, the USChina Lead­er­ship Ex­change Pro­gramme, the US-China Transpa­cific Ex­change Pro­gramme and the Hong Kong Ed­u­ca­tional and Cul­tural Pro­gramme.</p>
    <p>Sec­re­tary of State Mike Pompeo said these pro­grammes – con­ducted un­der a US law called the Mu­tual Ed­u­ca­tional and Cul­tural Ex­change Act (MECEA) that permits Amer­i­can gov­ern­ment em­ploy­ees to travel us­ing for­eign gov­ern­ment funds – were dis­guised as cul­tural ex­changes.</p>
    <p>“While other pro­grammes funded un­der the aus­pices of the MECEA are mu­tu­ally ben­e­fi­cial, the five pro­grammes in ques­tion are fully funded and op­er­ated by the PRC gov­ern­ment as soft power pro­pa­ganda tools,” Mr Pompeo said, re­fer­ring to the Peo­ple’s Repub­lic of China.</p>
    <p>“They pro­vide care­fully cu­rated ac­cess to Chi­nese Com­mu­nist Party of­fi­cials, not to the Chi­nese peo­ple, who do not en­joy free­doms of speech and as­sem­bly.”</p>
    <p>MECEA is a 1961 law signed by then Pres­i­dent John F. Kennedy and aimed at boost­ing aca­demic and cul­tural ex­changes with for­eign coun­tries.</p>
    <p>The Chi­nese Em­bassy in Wash­ing­ton did not im­me­di­ately re­turn a mes­sage seek­ing com­ment on the move.</p>
    <p>At­tempts to reach rep­re­sen­ta­tives for the pro­grammes sin­gled out by the State Depart­ment were not im­me­di­ately suc­cess­ful.</p>
    <p>The ter­mi­na­tion of the pro­grammes is the lat­est re­flec­tion of</p>
    <p>Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump’s sharply an­tag­o­nis­tic re­la­tion­ship with China.</p>
    <p>Un­der Mr Trump, the US launched a trade war with Bei­jing, has chal­lenged Bei­jing’s ter­ri­to­rial am­bi­tions in dis­puted Asian waters, crit­i­cised its crack­down on free­doms in Hong Kong and blamed China’s han­dling of the ini­tial coro­n­avirus out­break of the</p>
    <p>CARE­FULLY CU­RATED pan­demic now en­gulf­ing globe.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, the Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion on Fri­day opted not to grant ByteDance a new ex­ten­sion of an or­der re­quir­ing the Chi­nese com­pany to di­vest TikTok’s US as­sets, but talks will con­tinue over the short video-shar­ing app’s fate, two sources briefed on the mat­ter said.</p>
    <p>A Trea­sury Depart­ment rep­re­sen­ta­tive said the Com­mit­tee on For­eign In­vest­ment in the United States (CFIUS) “is en­gag­ing with ByteDance to com­plete the di­vest­ment and other steps nec­es­sary to re­solve the na­tional se­cu­rity risks”.</p>
    <p>CFIUS had granted TikTok par­ent ByteDance a one-week ex­ten­sion un­til Fri­day over the or­der.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump’s Au­gust or­der gave the Jus­tice Depart­ment the power to en­force the di­vesti­ture or­der once the dead­line ex­pired, but it is un­clear when or how the gov­ern­ment may seek to com­pel the di­vesti­ture.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump was said to have per­son­ally made the de­ci­sion not to ap­prove any ad­di­tional ex­ten­sions at a meet­ing of se­nior US of­fi­cials, ac­cord­ing to a per­son briefed on the meet­ing.</p>
    <p>The gov­ern­ment had pre­vi­ously is­sued a 15-day and a seven-day ex­ten­sion of the ini­tial 90-day dead­line, which was Nov 12.</p>
    <p>The Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion con­tends that TikTok poses na­tional se­cu­rity con­cerns as the per­sonal data of US users could be ob­tained by China’s gov­ern­ment.</p>
    <p>TikTok, which has more than 100 mil­lion US users, de­nies the al­le­ga­tion.</p>
    <p>Un­der pres­sure from the US gov­ern­ment, ByteDance has been in talks for months to fi­nalise a deal with Wal­mart and Or­a­cle to shift TikTok’s US as­sets into a new en­tity to sat­isfy the di­vesti­ture or­der.</p>
    <p>China, mean­while, has tight­ened con­trol of tech­nol­ogy ex­ports in a move that prom­ises to com­pli­cate any deal for TikTok to sell US as­sets. the</p>
    <p>While other pro­grammes funded un­der the aus­pices of the MECEA are mu­tu­ally ben­e­fi­cial, the five pro­grammes in ques­tion are fully funded and op­er­ated by the PRC gov­ern­ment as soft power pro­pa­ganda tools... They pro­vide care­fully cu­rated ac­cess to Chi­nese Com­mu­nist Party of­fi­cials, not to the Chi­nese peo­ple, who do not en­joy free­doms of speech and as­sem­bly.</p>
    <p>U.S. SEC­RE­TARY OF STATE MIKE POMPEO, re­fer­ring to pro­grammes un­der the Mu­tual Ed­u­ca­tional and Cul­tural Ex­change Act, and to the Peo­ple’s Repub­lic of China.</p>
