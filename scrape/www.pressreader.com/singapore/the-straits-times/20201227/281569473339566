    <p>More than 50 coun­tries have im­posed travel re­stric­tions on Britain in a bid to stop the spread of a new, more in­fec­tious strain of the coro­n­avirus that has now been found in France and Spain, and even as far as Ja­pan.</p>
    <p>Sev­eral oth­ers, in­clud­ing Den­mark, Le­banon, Ger­many, Aus­tralia and the Nether­lands, have also re­ported cases of the strain, which has sent jit­ters through al­ready over­stretched health ser­vices.</p>
    <p>From t omor­row, the United States will re­quire pas­sen­gers flying from Britain to show proof of a negative Covid-19 test no more than 72 hours be­fore de­par­ture, the US Cen­tres for Dis­ease Con­trol and Pre­ven­tion (CDC) said.</p>
    <p>The CDC last week said Britain’s new Covid-19 vari­ant could al­ready be cir­cu­lat­ing in the US un­de­tected. Early anal­y­sis of the mu­tated strain sug­gests it may be as much as 70 per cent more trans­mis­si­ble than other cir­cu­lat­ing strains.</p>
    <p>Nor­way ex­tended its ban on flights from Britain un­til Tues­day, the Health Min­istry said on Fri­day.</p>
    <p>“It’s still pos­si­ble that the flights will be sus­pended un­til af­ter the New Year,” the min­istry said.</p>
    <p>In France, the au­thor­i­ties have re­opened bor­ders to Britain but in­sti­tuted a test­ing pol­icy, af­ter a snap 48-hour ban.</p>
    <p>For now, only French or Euro­pean Union cit­i­zens, those with res­i­dency rights there or busi­ness trav­ellers are al­lowed to make the cross­ing from Britain – if they pro­vide proof of a negative Covid-19 test less than three days old.</p>
    <p>The eas­ing of re­stric­tions was aimed at al­low­ing French cit­i­zens to re­turn home as well as to re­lieve a mas­sive build-up of freight goods.</p>
    <p>The in­te­rior min­istry said lim­its on travel from Britain would con­tinue un­til at least Jan 6.</p>
    <p>Re­gions from Hong Kong to Canada have tem­po­rar­ily sus­pended travel from Britain.</p>
    <p>Hong Kong also banned all re­cent trav­ellers from South Africa – where an­other Covid-19 strain has been found – and ex­tended a manda­tory quar­an­tine for most other over­seas ar­rivals to 21 days.</p>
    <p>Britain it­self has im­posed curbs on ar­rivals from South Africa.</p>
    <p>South Africa, mean­while, pushed back against claims that its strain is more in­fec­tious or dan­ger­ous than the one from Britain.</p>
    <p>While Britain’s virus vari­ant has a mu­ta­tion oc­cur­ring at a site com­mon with the South African strain, they are “two com­pletely in­de­pen­dent lin­eages”, South Africa’s</p>
    <p>Health Min­is­ter Zweli Mkhize said.</p>
    <p>Around the world, coun­tries are start­ing to find Britain’s new Covid-19 vari­ant on their shores.</p>
    <p>France re­ported its first case of the vari­ant late on Fri­day, found in a cit­i­zen liv­ing in Britain, who ar­rived from Lon­don on Dec 19.</p>
    <p>The French Health Min­istry said he was asymp­to­matic and self-iso­lat­ing at home in Tours.</p>
    <p>In Spain, four cases of the Bri­tish vari­ant were con­firmed in Madrid yesterday. The pa­tients were “not se­ri­ously ill”, the Madrid re­gional govern­ment’s deputy health chief An­to­nio Za­p­a­tero said.</p>
    <p>Swe­den de­tected the Bri­tish vari­ant in a trav­eller from Britain, its health agency said yesterday, while Ital­ian au­thor­i­ties also found an in­fected pa­tient in Rome.</p>
    <p>In Ja­pan, five peo­ple who en­tered the coun­try from Britain were con­firmed to have the mu­tated form of the virus, Ja­pan Times re­ported on Fri­day.</p>
    <p>Two of them ar­rived at Tokyo’s Haneda air­port, and the re­main­ing three at Kan­sai In­ter­na­tional Air­port in Osaka.</p>
    <p>The World Health Or­gan­i­sa­tion (WHO) said cases of the Bri­tish strain have also been found in Den­mark, the Nether­lands and Aus­tralia.</p>
    <p>The spread of the virus and its mu­ta­tions come as the Euro­pean Union tees up a vac­cine roll-out.</p>
    <p>The pan­demic has now claimed more than 1.7 mil­lion lives, but the launch of in­oc­u­la­tion cam­paigns around the world boosts hopes that next year may bring respite.</p>
    <p>The first doses of the Pfiz­erBioN­Tech vac­cine ar­rived in Italy, Spain and France yesterday, ready for dis­tri­bu­tion to el­der-care fa­cil­i­ties and hos­pi­tal staff.</p>
    <p>“We’ll get our free­dom back, we’ll be able to em­brace again,” Ital­ian For­eign Min­is­ter Luigi Di Maio said, urg­ing peo­ple to get the shot.</p>
    <p>Vac­ci­na­tions in all 27 Euro­pean Union coun­tries will start to­day.</p>
    <p>The WHO called on peo­ple to re­spect so­cial dis­tanc­ing guide­lines so as not to “squan­der” the “great, heart-wrench­ing sac­ri­fices” oth­ers had made to save lives.</p>
    <p>“Vac­cines are of­fer­ing the world a way out of this tragedy. But it will take time for the whole world to be vac­ci­nated,” WHO chief Te­dros Ad­hanom Ghe­breye­sus said.</p>
