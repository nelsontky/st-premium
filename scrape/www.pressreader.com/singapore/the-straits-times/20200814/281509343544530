    <p>WASHINGTON • Is­rael and the United Arab Emi­rates reached a his­toric peace deal yesterday that will lead to a full nor­mal­i­sa­tion of diplomatic re­la­tions be­tween the two Mid­dle Eastern nations in an agree­ment that US Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump helped bro­ker.</p>
    <p>Un­der the deal, Is­rael has agreed to sus­pend ap­ply­ing sovereignt­y to ar­eas of the West Bank that it has been dis­cussing an­nex­ing, se­nior White House of­fi­cials told Reuters.</p>
    <p>The peace deal was the prod­uct of lengthy talks be­tween Is­rael, the UAE and the United States that ac­cel­er­ated re­cently, White House of­fi­cials said. The agree­ment was sealed in a phone call yesterday be­tween Mr Trump, Is­raeli Prime Min­is­ter Ben­jamin Ne­tanyahu and Sheikh Mo­hammed Bin Zayed, Crown Prince of Abu Dhabi.</p>
    <p>The of­fi­cials de­scribed the agree­ment, to be known as the Abra­ham Ac­cords, as the first of its kind since Is­rael and Jor­dan signed a peace treaty in 1994. Egypt and Is­rael signed a peace treaty in Washington in March 1979.</p>
    <p>The present agree­ment gives Mr Trump a for­eign pol­icy suc­cess as he seeks re-elec­tion on Nov 3.</p>
    <p>Mr Ne­tanyahu hailed the deal as a “great day for peace”.</p>
    <p>Del­e­ga­tions from Is­rael and the UAE will meet in the com­ing weeks to sign bi­lat­eral agree­ments re­gard­ing in­vest­ment, tourism, di­rect flights, se­cu­rity, telecom­mu­ni­ca­tions and other is­sues, a joint state­ment is­sued by the three lead­ers said.</p>
    <p>But se­nior Pales­tinian of­fi­cial Hanan Ashrawi ac­cused the UAE of “nor­mal­i­sa­tion” with Is­rael. The vet­eran Pales­tinian ne­go­tia­tor said on Twit­ter: “The UAE has come out in the open on its se­cret deal­ings/nor­mal­i­sa­tion with Is­rael. Please don’t do us a favour.”</p>
    <p>WASHINGTON • A his­toric peace deal to nor­malise diplomatic ties be­tween Is­rael and the United Arab Emi­rates was sealed in a phone call yesterday be­tween US Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump, Is­raeli Prime Min­is­ter Ben­jamin Ne­tanyahu and Abu Dhabi’s Crown Prince Sheikh Mo­hammed Bin Zayed.</p>
    <p>Un­der the agree­ment, Is­rael agreed to sus­pend ap­ply­ing sovereignt­y to ar­eas of the West Bank that it has been dis­cussing an­nex­ing, se­nior White House of­fi­cials told Reuters.</p>
    <p>“HUGE break­through to­day! His­toric Peace Agree­ment be­tween our two GREAT friends, Is­rael and the United Arab Emi­rates,” Mr Trump wrote on Twit­ter.</p>
    <p>In the White House’s Oval Of­fice, Mr Trump said dis­cus­sions be­tween the two lead­ers had some­times been tense. He said sim­i­lar deals are be­ing dis­cussed with other coun­tries in the re­gion. A sign­ing cer­e­mony in­clud­ing del­e­ga­tions from Is­rael and the UAE will be held at the White House in the com­ing weeks, Mr Trump added.</p>
    <p>“Ev­ery­body said this would be im­pos­si­ble,” Mr Trump said. “After 49 years, Is­rael and the United Arab Emi­rates will fully nor­malise their diplomatic re­la­tions. They ex­change em­bassies and am­bas­sadors and be­gin co­op­er­a­tion across the bor­der.”</p>
    <p>The US of­fi­cials de­scribed the deal, to be known as the Abra­ham Ac­cords, as the first of its kind since Is­rael and Jor­dan signed a peace treaty in 1994. It also gives Mr Trump a for­eign pol­icy suc­cess as he seeks re-elec­tion on Nov 3.</p>
    <p>Mr Ne­tanyahu, in his first com­ment on the deal, said on Twit­ter that it is “a his­toric day for the state of Is­rael”. Also on Twit­ter, Abu Dhabi’s crown prince said that an agree­ment had been reached and that it would halt fur­ther Is­raeli an­nex­a­tion of Pales­tinian ter­ri­to­ries.</p>
    <p>“Dur­ing a call with Pres­i­dent Trump and Prime Min­is­ter Ne­tanyahu, an agree­ment was reached to stop fur­ther Is­raeli an­nex­a­tion of Pales­tinian ter­ri­to­ries. The UAE and Is­rael also agreed to co­op­er­a­tion and set­ting a road map to­wards es­tab­lish­ing a bi­lat­eral re­la­tion­ship,” he said.</p>
    <p>A se­nior Is­raeli of­fi­cial said ap­ply­ing Is­raeli sovereignt­y to ar­eas of the West Bank – ter­ri­tory Pales­tini­ans seek for a state along with Gaza and East Jerusalem – was still on the agenda, but added: “The Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion asked us to tem­po­rar­ily sus­pend the (sovereignt­y) an­nounce­ment so that the his­toric peace agree­ment with the UAE can be im­ple­mented.”</p>
    <p>A joint state­ment is­sued by the three nations said their lead­ers had “agreed to the full nor­mal­i­sa­tion of re­la­tions be­tween Is­rael and the United Arab Emi­rates”.</p>
    <p>“This his­toric diplomatic break­through will ad­vance peace in the Mid­dle East re­gion and is a tes­ta­ment to the bold diplo­macy and vi­sion of the three lead­ers and the courage of the United Arab Emi­rates and Is­rael to chart a new path that will un­lock the great po­ten­tial in the re­gion,” the state­ment said.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump said: “This deal is a sig­nif­i­cant step to­wards build­ing a more peace­ful, se­cure and pros­per­ous Mid­dle East. Now that the ice has been bro­ken, I ex­pect more Arab and Mus­lim coun­tries will fol­low the UAE’s lead...</p>
    <p>“We are al­ready dis­cussing this with other nations, very pow­er­ful, very good nations that want to see peace in the Mid­dle East...”</p>
    <p>Del­e­ga­tions from Is­rael and the UAE will meet soon to sign bi­lat­eral deals on in­vest­ment, tourism, di­rect flights, se­cu­rity, telecom­mu­ni­ca­tions and other is­sues. The two coun­tries are ex­pected to ex­change am­bas­sadors and em­bassies.</p>
    <p>The agree­ment en­vi­sions giv­ing Mus­lims greater ac­cess to the AlAqsa Mosque in the Old City of Jerusalem by al­low­ing them to fly from Abu Dhabi to Tel Aviv, White House of­fi­cials said.</p>
