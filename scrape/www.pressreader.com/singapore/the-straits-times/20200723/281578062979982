    <p>China vowed re­tal­i­a­tion after the United States forced the clo­sure of its Hous­ton con­sulate, adding to the hos­til­i­ties be­tween Wash­ing­ton and Bei­jing. The US State De­part­ment said it had or­dered the con­sulate to shut “to pro­tect Amer­i­can in­tel­lec­tual prop­erty and Amer­i­cans’ pri­vate in­for­ma­tion”.</p>
    <p>China yesterday vowed “firm coun­ter­mea­sures” against the US after the Chi­nese con­sulate in Hous­ton, Texas, was abruptly or­dered to shut, adding to the hos­til­i­ties be­tween Wash­ing­ton and Bei­jing.</p>
    <p>This comes on the back of US Sec­re­tary of State Mike Pom­peo’s com­ments call­ing for a global coali­tion to stand up against China.</p>
    <p>Ten­sions be­tween the world’s top two economies have ratch­eted up in re­cent weeks over a long list of is­sues rang­ing from trade to diplo­macy to the han­dling of the coro­n­avirus pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Re­ceiv­ing an or­der on Tues­day lo­cal time, the con­sulate was given 72 hours to stop op­er­a­tions and for its staff to va­cate the premises, a move Bei­jing called “po­lit­i­cal provo­ca­tion”.</p>
    <p>Chi­nese For­eign Min­istry spokesman Wang Wen­bin told a press brief­ing in Bei­jing that the or­dered clo­sure “se­ri­ously vi­o­lates” in­ter­na­tional laws and norms gov­ern­ing in­ter­na­tional re­la­tions. “China strongly con­demns such an out­ra­geous and un­jus­ti­fied move, which will sab­o­tage China-US re­la­tions. We urge the US to im­me­di­ately with­draw its er­ro­neous de­ci­sion. Oth­er­wise, China will make le­git­i­mate and nec­es­sary re­ac­tions,” he said.</p>
    <p>Mr Wang ac­cused the US gov­ern­ment of stig­ma­tis­ing China and launch­ing un­war­ranted at­tacks against the coun­try’s so­cial sys­tem, ha­rass­ing Chi­nese diplo­mats, and in­tim­i­dat­ing and in­ter­ro­gat­ing Chi­nese stu­dents, even con­fis­cat­ing their de­vices.</p>
    <p>He fur­ther claimed the US has of­ten vi­o­lated diplomatic norms by im­pos­ing re­stric­tions on Chi­nese diplo­mats and open­ing diplomatic pouches. China’s diplomatic staff have re­peat­edly re­ceived death and bomb threats, he added.</p>
    <p>China has five other mis­sions in the United States – con­sulates in Chicago, Los An­ge­les, New York and San Fran­cisco, as well as its em­bassy in Wash­ing­ton.</p>
    <p>“Mean­while, per­son­nel of the US em­bassy in China have long been en­gag­ing in in­fil­tra­tion and in­ter­fer­ence ac­tiv­i­ties... If we com­pare the two, it is only too ev­i­dent which is en­gaged in in­ter­fer­ence, in­fil­tra­tion and con­fronta­tion,” Mr Wang said.</p>
    <p>The US has diplomatic mis­sions in six main­land Chi­nese cities – con­sulates in Chengdu, Guangzhou, Shang­hai, Shenyang and Wuhan, as well as its em­bassy in Bei­jing.</p>
    <p>A Reuters’ source yesterday said China is con­sid­er­ing or­der­ing the clo­sure of the con­sulate in Wuhan city. US State De­part­ment spokesman Mor­gan Orta­gus told re­porters dur­ing Mr Pom­peo’s visit to Copen­hagen yesterday: “We have di­rected the clo­sure of PRC Con­sulate Gen­eral Hous­ton, in or­der to pro­tect Amer­i­can in­tel­lec­tual prop­erty and Amer­i­cans’ pri­vate in­for­ma­tion.”</p>
    <p>Hours ear­lier at about 8pm lo­cal time, po­lice and fire­fight­ers de­scended on the con­sulate in Hous­ton, fol­low­ing re­ports that pa­pers were be­ing burned out­side in open con­tain­ers. Lo­cal TV sta­tions KPRC and KHOU showed fires in mul­ti­ple open con­tain­ers while fire trucks and po­lice cars were seen parked out­side the con­sulate.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing a visit to Lon­don on Tues­day, Mr Pom­peo urged the “en­tire world” to stand up against China, whom he ac­cused of en­gag­ing in “a cover-up and co-opt­ing” the World Health Or­gan­i­sa­tion by al­legedly sup­press­ing early de­tails of the “pre­ventable” Covid-19 pan­demic.</p>
    <p>“We think that the en­tire world needs to work to­gether to en­sure that ev­ery coun­try, in­clud­ing China, be­haves in the in­ter­na­tional sys­tem in ways that are ap­pro­pri­ate and con­sis­tent with the in­ter­na­tional or­der,” he said.</p>
