    <p>Thai­land Prime Min­is­ter Prayut Chan-o-cha yes­ter­day asked stu­dent-led pro­test­ers “not to cre­ate chaos” and warned them not to in­sult the monar­chy, an il­le­gal act in the king­dom. He promised that Par­lia­ment would con­sider the pro­test­ers’ de­mands to amend the 2017 Con­sti­tu­tion drafted un­der mil­i­tary aus­pices. WORLD</p>
    <p>BANGKOK • Thai­land’s Prime Min­is­ter yes­ter­day asked in­creas­ingly bold stu­dent-led pro­test­ers “not to cre­ate chaos”, af­ter some broke long­stand­ing taboos by openly call­ing for re­form of the con­sti­tu­tional monar­chy.</p>
    <p>Prime Min­is­ter Prayut Chan-ocha, a for­mer army chief who staged a coup six years ago and has led mil­i­tary-backed gov­ern­ments ever since, also promised that Par­lia­ment would con­sider pro­test­ers’ de­mands to amend the Con­sti­tu­tion.</p>
    <p>“I beg peo­ple not to cre­ate chaos at this time. We are solv­ing these prob­lems to­gether,” Mr Prayut told re­porters af­ter a Cab­i­net meet­ing.</p>
    <p>He said he was “wor­ried” about the young pro­test­ers who have been gath­er­ing in small groups in dif­fer­ent parts of the coun­try, call­ing for the dis­so­lu­tion of Par­lia­ment and new elec­tions.</p>
    <p>Mr Prayut said a com­mit­tee has been formed in Par­lia­ment to dis­cuss pos­si­ble changes to a 2017 Con­sti­tu­tion drafted un­der mil­i­tary aus­pices and that a mech­a­nism to gauge the views of young peo­ple would be set up this month.</p>
    <p>Op­po­si­tion ac­tivists say that un­der the Con­sti­tu­tion, Mr Prayut was vir­tu­ally as­sured of stay­ing on as prime min­is­ter af­ter a dis­puted 2019 gen­eral elec­tion by the creation of a junta-ap­pointed Se­nate.</p>
    <p>“I sup­port changes that are needed and I am not in con­flict,” he said.</p>
    <p>He did not say what changes would be con­sid­ered in Par­lia­ment, where his rul­ing coali­tion holds a com­fort­able ma­jor­ity, af­ter a main op­po­si­tion party was dis­solved in Fe­bru­ary.</p>
    <p>A court ban of the op­po­si­tion Fu­ture For­ward Party sparked cam­pus demon­stra­tions and stu­dent pro­test­ers took to the streets last month, with some 2,500 ral­ly­ing at Bangkok’s Democ­racy Mon­u­ment. Since then, protests have spread. Mr Prayut has pre­vi­ously warned pro­test­ers not to in­sult the monar­chy, as the act is il­le­gal in Thai­land, though he said King Maha Va­ji­ra­longkorn had asked that peo­ple no longer be pros­e­cuted un­der that law.</p>
    <p>On Mon­day night, stu­dent pro­test­ers is­sued a state­ment call­ing for changes in laws “that ex­pand the power of the monarch and that could im­pinge on democ­racy where the King is the head of state”.</p>
    <p>Of­fi­cials at the Royal Palace yes­ter­day said they had no com­ment when asked about the protest de­mands.</p>
    <p>The Con­sti­tu­tion says the King is to be “revered” and in­sult­ing the monar­chy is a crime pun­ish­able by up to 15 years in prison un­der “lese ma­jeste” laws.</p>
    <p>Af­ter the King took the throne in 2016, the palace re­quired re­vi­sions to the new Con­sti­tu­tion that gave him greater emer­gency pow­ers. He has since taken per­sonal con­trol over some army units and palace as­sets worth tens of bil­lions of dol­lars.</p>
    <p>Asked about the pro­test­ers openly dis­cussing the King, Mr Prayut said it was a mat­ter of law en­force­ment.</p>
    <p>“I won’t stop it from hap­pen­ing. This is­sue is for the au­thor­i­ties to fol­low the law,” he said. “Protests are a right un­der the law, but they have to re­spect the law and rules. I am not threat­en­ing, but I am wor­ried.”</p>
    <p>The po­lice did not stop the six speak­ers at the protest, but said that any sus­pected of­fences would be in­ves­ti­gated.</p>
