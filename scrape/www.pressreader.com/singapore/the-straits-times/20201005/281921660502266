    <p>Sin­ga­pore has drawn at­ten­tion to the con­se­quences of so­cially ir­re­spon­si­ble be­hav­iour by fin­ing 32 din­ers $300 each for flout­ing Covid-19 rules at food and bev­er­age out­lets, such as for not wear­ing masks promptly af­ter eat­ing or drink­ing, in­ter­min­gling be­tween ta­bles, and sit­ting in groups of more than five when din­ing in pub­lic. Sev­eral more food and bev­er­age out­lets have also been or­dered to close for 10 days, and some out­lets have been fined, ac­cord­ing to the Min­istry of Sus­tain­abil­ity and the En­vi­ron­ment. The way in which din­ers and din­ing es­tab­lish­ments have been pe­nalised re­veals the im­por­tance of mak­ing both pa­trons and own­ers re­spon­si­ble for what oc­curs on their premises.</p>
    <p>Cus­tomers should not be beguiled into be­liev­ing that the onus falls only on pro­pri­etors to abide by safe dis­tanc­ing rules. Cer­tainly, out­lets must not com­mit of­fences such as ad­mit­ting and seat­ing groups of more than five to­gether, and fail­ing to en­sure that food han­dlers wear their masks prop­erly. How­ever, pa­trons on their part must not in­ter­min­gle across ta­bles be­cause it de­feats the pur­pose of safe dis­tanc­ing. They must also re­mem­ber to put on their masks af­ter eat­ing and drink­ing. Re­as­sur­ingly, most cus­tomers who for­get to put on their masks af­ter meals do com­ply when re­minded. How­ever, since servers of­ten are busy with tak­ing or­ders and serv­ing meals, there could be gaps be­tween checks and in­form­ing din­ers to wear their masks af­ter they have eaten. In fact, cus­tomers should not need to be re­minded of what they know to be an obli­ga­tion.</p>
    <p>Over­all, the good news is that com­mu­nity cases in Sin­ga­pore are low. The bad news, how­ever, is that this is mak­ing some peo­ple com­pla­cent. This mix­ture of good and bad is how clus­ters of cases have formed else­where, lead­ing some­times to num­bers not just creep­ing up but soar­ing be­cause ir­re­spon­si­ble peo­ple think that the prob­lem has passed. They ig­nore the sim­ple logic that they feel safe now purely be­cause ear­lier re­stric­tions have worked. And these mea­sures worked be­cause peo­ple were fright­ened suf­fi­ciently of Covid-19 to abide by those re­stric­tions.</p>
    <p>Un­til a vac­cine is dis­cov­ered, proved to be suc­cess­ful and made avail­able to the gen­eral pop­u­la­tion, the drop in com­mu­nity trans­mis­sions pro­vides no guar­an­tee of an es­cape from the dis­ease. To think oth­er­wise and lower so­ci­ety’s col­lec­tive guard is to for­get the lessons of the past six months liv­ing with the global threat. Even as out­door din­ing re­turns to a sem­blance of nor­malcy, din­ers must re­mem­ber that the ter­ri­ble eco­nomic reper­cus­sions of Covid-19 re­main an ev­ery­day re­al­ity for busi­nesses and in­di­vid­u­als. Ev­ery de­lay in fight­ing the dis­ease be­cause of com­pla­cency will erode the achieve­ments reg­is­tered against it till now, and pro­long the eco­nomic pain. Sin­ga­pore­ans must stay alert to their re­spon­si­bil­i­ties.</p>
