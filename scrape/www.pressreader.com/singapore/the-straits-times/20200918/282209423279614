    <p>WASH­ING­TON Com­pa­nies that sup­ply the chip sec­tor with so­phis­ti­cated and ex­pen­sive equip­ment plan to warn US Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump’s ad­min­is­tra­tion against a pro­posal to black­list China’s top chip­maker, Semi­con­duc­tor Man­u­fac­tur­ing In­ter­na­tional Corp (SMIC), ar­gu­ing that it would be “detri­men­tal” to US in­dus­try.</p>
    <p>The com­pa­nies are rep­re­sented by the semi­con­duc­tor and elec­tron­ics man­u­fac­tur­ing sup­pli­ers in­dus­try group Semi, which drafted a let­ter seen by Reuters that could be sent as soon as this week to Com­merce Sec­re­tary Wil­bur Ross.</p>
    <p>In the draft let­ter, the group ar­gues that black­list­ing SMIC would jeop­ar­dise the tech­no­log­i­cal edge of the United States by mak­ing it harder for Amer­i­can firms to sup­ply the com­pany, which ac­counts for as much as US$5 bil­lion (S$6.8 bil­lion) in an­nual US ori­gin equip­ment and ma­te­rial sales.</p>
    <p>The group also ar­gues that such a move would “con­trib­ute to a grow­ing per­cep­tion” that the de­liv­ery of US goods is “un­re­li­able” and hit US mar­ket share world­wide.</p>
    <p>“We urge the (Com­merce) Depart­ment to care­fully con­sider the im­me­di­ate and long-term detri­men­tal im­pacts to US in­dus­try, eco­nomic and na­tional se­cu­rity that may re­sult from the ad­di­tion of SMIC to the en­tity list,” said the group, which has 2,400 mem­bers world­wide, in­clud­ing SMIC and US chip equip­ment mak­ers Lam Re­search and Ap­plied Ma­te­ri­als.</p>
    <p>The Com­merce Depart­ment did not im­me­di­ately re­spond to a re­quest for com­ment.</p>
    <p>Semi’s vice-pres­i­dent of global pub­lic pol­icy Joe Pasetti said: “We don’t com­ment on draft let­ters leaked to the press.”</p>
    <p>Reuters re­ported ear­lier this month that the De­fence Depart­ment was work­ing with other agen­cies to de­ter­mine whether to add SMIC to the Com­merce Depart­ment’s “en­tity list”, which would force Amer­i­can sup­pli­ers to seek hard-to-get li­cences be­fore ship­ping to the com­pany. Shares of the com­pany plunged by nearly a quar­ter on the news.</p>
    <p>SMIC said in a state­ment at the time that it was “in com­plete shock” over the news but was open to com­mu­ni­ca­tion with US gov­ern­ment agen­cies in hopes of re­solv­ing any mis­un­der­stand­ings.</p>
    <p>While a De­fence Depart­ment of­fi­cial did not dis­close the mo­tive for the pro­posed ac­tion, SMIC’s re­la­tion­ship to the Chi­nese mil­i­tary is un­der scru­tiny, sources told Reuters, as the Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion in­creas­ingly trains its fo­cus on China’s mil­i­tary mus­cle.</p>
