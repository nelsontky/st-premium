    <p>It al­most doesn’t mat­ter who started the fires this week in the squalid refugee camp in Les­bos called Mo­ria, leav­ing thou­sands to sleep on the streets.</p>
    <p>It could have been the des­per­ate mi­grants, dwelling in cramped tents with­out clean toi­lets and forced by Covid-19 to “quar­an­tine”, what­ever that may mean in such con­di­tions. It could have been lo­cal Greeks who re­sent what they see as a slum that sul­lies their beau­ti­ful is­land. Or the fires could have flared all by them­selves, be­cause in such a wretched place, bad things are just bound to hap­pen.</p>
    <p>Ei­ther way, Europe – from Brus­sels to Ber­lin, Bu­dapest, War­saw and Athens – is re­spon­si­ble for this tragedy. This is blow­back for one of the Euro­pean Union’s worst fail­ures on an ad­mit­tedly long list – its in­abil­ity to fix a bro­ken refugee sys­tem.</p>
    <p>It’s been clear for many years that mi­gra­tion from poor and war-torn re­gions in the Mid­dle</p>
    <p>East and Africa to this com­par­a­tively or­derly con­ti­nent would be one of the EU’s big­gest chal­lenges. But most mem­ber states that can’t be reached by dinghy, raft or boat across the Mediter­ranean – only Greece, Malta, Italy and Spain can be – re­fused to ac­knowl­edge mi­gra­tion as their prob­lem.</p>
    <p>The re­sult was the no­to­ri­ous and cyn­i­cal “Dublin sys­tem” re­quir­ing mi­grants, at least in the­ory, to ap­ply for asy­lum only in the first EU state they phys­i­cally en­ter.</p>
    <p>Un­less they jet in by air­plane – and Syr­i­ans who’ve been bombed out of their homes tend to flee with­out board­ing passes – this means the Mediter­ranean states.</p>
    <p>The re­sult­ing dys­func­tion came to a head ex­actly half a decade ago, dur­ing the refugee cri­sis. In the sum­mer of 2015, Syr­i­ans, Afghans and oth­ers fled to Greece, which was then suf­fer­ing from the euro cri­sis. From there, the mi­grants walked across the Balkans to­wards Ger­many and the north – un­til many of them were stranded at a train sta­tion in Bu­dapest.</p>
    <p>In­stead of help­ing, Hun­gar­ian Prime Min­is­ter Vik­tor Or­ban blocked them. On their nightly news that sum­mer, Euro­peans watched fam­i­lies sleep­ing on plat­forms and train tracks and walk­ing along high­ways to­wards the Ger­man bor­der.</p>
    <p>Ger­man Chan­cel­lor An­gela Merkel de­cided that turn­ing back the refugees was not an op­tion. Nei­ther Ger­many nor the world, 70 years af­ter the Holo­caust, wanted to see Ger­mans in uni­form fenc­ing in down­trod­den and help­less peo­ple. So she let them in. Jour­nal­ists like me re­ported that she “opened the bor­der”.</p>
    <p>But in fact, the Aus­tro-Ger­man bor­der was al­ready open; she just didn’t close it.</p>
    <p>The mil­lion or so mainly Mus­lim mi­grants who came in the fol­low­ing months split Euro­peans. Some wel­comed the refugees, but oth­ers were fright­ened or re­pulsed by them, fear­ing that they threat­ened their way of life. Ger­mans started march­ing in protest in cities such as Dres­den.</p>
    <p>A right-wing and xeno­pho­bic party called the Al­ter­na­tive for Ger­many, which in early 2005 had been close to dis­solv­ing, sud­denly soared in the polls.</p>
    <p>The back­lash dom­i­nated politics in Ger­many and all of Europe. Dr Merkel, in par­tic­u­lar, was blamed for this cri­sis, as if she, rather than the likes of Syr­ian Pres­i­dent Bashar al-As­sad, had prod­ded the refugees onto their jour­ney. Self­ies of smil­ing mi­grants pos­ing with the friendly Chan­cel­lor zipped around the world. Dr Merkel had cre­ated a “pull ef­fect”, it was said.</p>
    <p>The Chan­cel­lor and her cen­tre-right party soon changed course. The “wel­come cul­ture” was ended, as laws were tight­ened, asy­lum pro­cesses tweaked and de­por­ta­tions ac­cel­er­ated.</p>
    <p>A ten­u­ous deal with Turkey was struck, meant to dis­suade refugees from cross­ing to the Greek is­lands. In ef­fect, if not on pa­per, the EU’s Dublin sys­tem had been abol­ished.</p>
    <p>What would re­place it? In prin­ci­ple, there was an ob­vi­ous an­swer. The EU needed a new sys­tem, in which Euro­pean agen­cies, such as Fron­tex, po­liced the bloc’s ex­ter­nal bor­ders, ac­cepted mi­grants in a hu­mane way and speed­ily pro­cessed their asy­lum claims. Suc­cess­ful ap­pli­cants would be re­set­tled across the whole EU ac­cord­ing to a set formula. Un­suc­cess­ful ones would be swiftly de­ported to their home coun­tries.</p>
    <p>But such a Euro­pean so­lu­tion never came about. That’s be­cause the EU still makes most de­ci­sions by una­nim­ity, and the usual sus­pects – al­ways led by Mr Or­ban and his copy­cats in the na­tion­al­ist gov­ern­ment of Poland, and states like Aus­tria – block every step. In ef­fect, they’re sab­o­tag­ing the EU.</p>
    <p>So in re­al­ity, an un­of­fi­cial mi­gra­tion regime evolved in­stead. With­out ad­mit­ting to it, mem­ber states have tried to turn the pull fac­tor into a push fac­tor by mak­ing the ex­is­tence of refugees, like those in Mo­ria, as un­pleas­ant as pos­si­ble and just short of legally in­hu­mane.</p>
    <p>Thus Greece, em­u­lat­ing Aus­tralia, tries to block refugees from reach­ing its main­land by herd­ing them into is­land camps, of which Mo­ria is the largest. De­signed for 3,000 peo­ple, it ac­com­mo­dated 20,000 at some points, and 12,000 when the fires broke out this week.</p>
    <p>At sea, Greek ships have been ob­served push­ing back refugee boats with force, al­though Athens de­nies these re­ports. But sin­gling out Greece would be un­fair. If Europe’s refugee camps are hell, it’s be­cause Europe im­plic­itly wants them to be. That’s why fires such as Mo­ria’s are in­evitable, as are dis­ease out­breaks, vi­o­lence and every other form of hu­man mis­ery.</p>
    <p>Un­less Europe strong-arms its sabo­teurs, start­ing with Mr Or­ban, to fix its mi­gra­tion sys­tem, it will stum­ble from one hu­man­i­tar­ian dis­as­ter to another.</p>
    <p>Grad­u­ally, this will dis­credit any claim that the EU might have to be­ing a com­mu­nity of “val­ues”.</p>
    <p>And in that case, what’s the point of hav­ing the EU at all?</p>
