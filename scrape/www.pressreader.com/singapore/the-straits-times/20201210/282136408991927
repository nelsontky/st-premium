    <p>Cer­tifi­cate of en­ti­tle­ment (COE) prices closed higher across the board in the lat­est ten­der yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The COE price for cars up to 1,600cc and 130bhp fin­ished at $40,714, up from $37,690 three weeks ago. The pre­mium for cars above 1,600cc or 130bhp closed at $45,012, up from $41,101.</p>
    <p>The pre­mium for the Open COE, which can be used for any ve­hi­cle type ex­cept mo­tor­cy­cles but ends up pre­dom­i­nantly used for big­ger cars, also ended higher at $45,510, from $41,503.</p>
    <p>The com­mer­cial ve­hi­cle COE price closed at $32,889, up from $30,334. The mo­tor­cy­cle pre­mium fin­ished at $7,670, up slightly from $7,300.</p>
    <p>Mr Neo Nam Heng, chair­man of the di­ver­si­fied Prime group, said the rise was due to many deal­ers of­fer­ing year-end pro­mo­tions, sell­ing ve­hi­cles even at a loss to in­crease their sales sta­tis­tics. The three-week gap be­tween this bid and the pre­vi­ous one on Nov 18, in­stead of the usual fort­night, also led to a greater jump, he added.</p>
    <p>Mr Ray­mond Tang, man­ag­ing di­rec­tor of Yong Lee Seng Mo­tor, said the in­crease could also be due to peo­ple’s ex­pec­ta­tions that the COE av­er­age monthly quota will de­crease in the com­ing months.</p>
    <p>The Land Trans­port Au­thor­ity had an­nounced in Oc­to­ber that the quota of COEs for cars, in­clud­ing Open COEs, will in­crease by 5.8 per cent to 4,865 a month for the Novem­ber to Jan­uary pe­riod.</p>
    <p>This is not ex­pected to per­sist, Mr Tang said.</p>
    <p>“They might feel that if they don’t go in now, they might not even be able to get a COE next year. Car deal­ers tell con­sumers this,” he added.</p>
    <p>The COEs could also be ear­marked for cleaner cars, which will re­ceive $5,000 more in re­bates from next year, up from $20,000 for the clean­est ones. The bumper crop could also be due to peo­ple buy­ing cars that are more pol­lu­tive now to avoid higher sur­charges for them from July, he added.</p>
