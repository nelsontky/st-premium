    <p>As Amer­i­cans grap­ple with prob­lems of racism and power, a newly de­clas­si­fied trove of White House tapes pro­vides star­tling ev­i­dence of the big­otry voiced by pres­i­dent Richard Nixon and Dr Henry Kissinger, his na­tional se­cu­rity ad­viser.</p>
    <p>The full con­tent of these tapes re­veals how US pol­icy to­wards South Asia un­der Mr Nixon was in­flu­enced by his ha­tred of, and sex­ual re­pul­sion to­wards, In­di­ans. These new tapes are about one of the grimmest episodes of the Cold War, which brought ruin to Bangladesh in 1971.</p>
    <p>At that time, In­dia tilted heav­ily to­wards the Soviet Union while a mil­i­tary dic­ta­tor­ship in Pak­istan backed the United States. Pak­istan flanked In­dia on two sides: West Pak­istan and the more pop­u­lous, and mostly Ben­gali, East Pak­istan.</p>
    <p>In March 1971, af­ter Ben­gali na­tion­al­ists won a demo­cratic elec­tion in Pak­istan, the junta be­gan a dev­as­tat­ing crack­down on its own Ben­gali cit­i­zens. Mr Nixon and Dr Kissinger staunchly sup­ported the mil­i­tary regime in Pak­istan as it killed hun­dreds of thou­sands of Ben­galis, with 10 mil­lion refugees flee­ing into neigh­bour­ing In­dia.</p>
    <p>The cri­sis cul­mi­nated in De­cem­ber 1971 when In­dia de­feated Pak­istan in a short war that re­sulted in the cre­ation of an in­de­pen­dent Bangladesh.</p>
    <p>I doc­u­mented the vi­o­lent birth of Bangladesh and the dis­grace­ful White House diplo­macy around it in my book The Blood Tele­gram, pub­lished in 2013. Much of my ev­i­dence came from scores of White House tapes, which re­veal Mr Nixon and Dr Kissinger as they re­ally op­er­ated be­hind closed doors. Yet many tapes still had long bleeps.</p>
    <p>In De­cem­ber 2012, I filed a le­gal re­quest for a manda­tory de­clas­si­fi­ca­tion re­view with the Richard Nixon Pres­i­den­tial Li­brary and Mu­seum. Af­ter con­sid­er­able wran­gling, the Nixon ar­chiv­ists at last re­leased a few un­bleeped tapes in May 2018 and July 2019, then 28 more in batches from Oc­to­ber 2019 to this past May. (There are bleeps still re­main­ing on a cou­ple of the re­viewed tapes, some of which I am ap­peal­ing against.)</p>
    <p>It was stun­ning to hear a con­ver­sa­tion be­tween Mr Nixon, Dr Kissinger and Mr H.R. Halde­man, the White House chief of staff, in the Oval Of­fice in June 1971.</p>
    <p>“Un­doubt­edly the most unattrac­tive women in the world are the In­dian women,” said Mr Nixon. “Un­doubt­edly,” he re­peated, with a venomous tone. He con­tin­ued: “The most sex­less, noth­ing, these peo­ple. I mean, peo­ple say, what about the black Africans? Well, you can see some­thing, the vi­tal­ity there, I mean they have a lit­tle an­i­mal-like charm, but God, those In­di­ans... pa­thetic.”</p>
    <p>On Nov 4, 1971, dur­ing a pri­vate break from a con­tentious White House sum­mit with prime min­is­ter Indira Gandhi of In­dia – a rare woman leader at the time – the pres­i­dent ha­rangued Dr Kissinger about his sex­ual dis­gust at In­di­ans. Mr Nixon said: “How the hell do they turn other peo­ple on, Henry? Tell me.” Dr Kissinger’s re­sponse is in­audi­ble, but it did not dis­cour­age the pres­i­dent from his theme.</p>
    <p>The pres­i­dent, in be­tween bit­ter spar­ring matches with Mrs Gandhi about the dan­ger of war with Pak­istan, sug­gested to Dr Kissinger that his own sex­ual neu­roses were hav­ing an im­pact on for­eign pol­icy: “They turn me off. They are re­pul­sive and it’s just easy to be tough with them.”</p>
    <p>Dr Kissinger has por­trayed him­self as above the racism of the Nixon White House, but the tapes show him join­ing in the big­otry, though the tapes can­not de­ter­mine whether he truly shared the pres­i­dent’s prej­u­dices or was just pan­der­ing to him.</p>
    <p>On June 3, 1971, Dr Kissinger was in­dig­nant at the In­di­ans, while the coun­try was shel­ter­ing mil­lions of trau­ma­tised Ben­gali refugees who had fled the Pak­istan army. He blamed the In­di­ans for caus­ing the refugee flow, apparently by their covert spon­sor­ship of the Ben­gali in­sur­gency. He then con­demned In­di­ans as a whole: “They are a scav­eng­ing peo­ple.”</p>
    <p>On June 17, 1971, the pres­i­dent was fu­ri­ous at Mr Ken­neth Keat­ing, his am­bas­sador to In­dia, who two days ear­lier had con­fronted Mr Nixon and Dr Kissinger in the Oval Of­fice, call­ing Pak­istan’s crack­down “al­most en­tirely a mat­ter of geno­cide”. In the con­ver­sa­tion, Dr Kissinger made an­other sweep­ing state­ment about In­di­ans: “They are su­perb flat­ter­ers, Mr Pres­i­dent. They are mas­ters at flat­tery. They are mas­ters at sub­tle flat­tery. That’s how they sur­vived 600 years.”</p>
    <p>Dr Kissinger voiced prej­u­dices about Pak­ista­nis, too. On Aug 10, 1971, while dis­cussing with Mr Nixon whether the Pak­istani junta would ex­e­cute the im­pris­oned leader of the Ben­gali na­tion­al­ists, he told the pres­i­dent: “I tell you, the Pak­ista­nis are fine peo­ple, but they are prim­i­tive in their men­tal struc­ture.” He added: “They just don’t have the sub­tlety of the In­di­ans.”</p>
    <p>These emo­tional dis­plays of prej­u­dice help to ex­plain a for­eign pol­icy de­ba­cle. Mr Nixon and Dr Kissinger’s poli­cies to­wards South Asia in 1971 were not just a moral dis­as­ter but also a strate­gic fi­asco on their own Cold War terms.</p>
    <p>While the two men had some rea­sons to favour Pak­istan, an Amer­i­can ally which was se­cretly help­ing to bring about their his­toric open­ing to China, their bi­ases and emo­tions con­tributed to their ex­ces­sive sup­port for Pak­istan’s mur­der­ous dic­ta­tor­ship through­out its atroc­i­ties.</p>
    <p>As Dr Kissinger’s own staff had warned him, this one-sided ap­proach handed In­dia the op­por­tu­nity to rip Pak­istan in half, first by spon­sor­ing the Ben­gali gueril­las and then with the war in De­cem­ber 1971 – re­sult­ing in a Cold War vic­tory for the Soviet camp.</p>
    <p>For decades, Mr Nixon and Dr Kissinger have por­trayed them­selves as bril­liant prac­ti­tion­ers of re­alpoli­tik, run­ning a for­eign pol­icy that dis­pas­sion­ately served the in­ter­ests of the United States.</p>
    <p>But these de­clas­si­fied White House tapes con­firm a starkly dif­fer­ent pic­ture: racism and misog­yny at the high­est lev­els, cov­ered up for decades un­der lu­di­crous claims of na­tional se­cu­rity. A fair his­tor­i­cal as­sess­ment of Mr Nixon and Dr Kissinger must in­clude the full truth, un­bleeped.</p>
