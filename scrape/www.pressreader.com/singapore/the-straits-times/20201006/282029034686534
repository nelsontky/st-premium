    <p>Over nine days, Mr Narayana Tum­mala­palli ran 52km in a route that formed the words, “We can do it 4 u”, as part of the Sing­tel-Sin­ga­pore Can­cer So­ci­ety Race Against Can­cer 2020.</p>
    <p>The mes­sage that he wanted to send out was one of in­clu­sive­ness. “I wanted to make a mes­sage to so­ci­ety, that it was for ev­ery­one,” he said, stress­ing that can­cer pa­tients are part of so­ci­ety too.</p>
    <p>The 36-year-old IT spe­cial­ist was one of 4,066 par­tic­i­pants and 192 teams to raise funds for can­cer pa­tients and their fam­i­lies by sub­mit­ting the routes that they cov­ered be­tween Sept 19 and Sept 27.</p>
    <p>This year’s race was held in a vir­tual for­mat ow­ing to the coro­n­avirus pan­demic. Par­tic­i­pants ran in their own time and wher­ever they wanted, and clocked their dis­tance and du­ra­tion us­ing a GPS-en­abled app.</p>
    <p>Each par­tic­i­pant was tagged to a fund-rais­ing amount, de­pend­ing on the dis­tance they reg­is­tered for.</p>
    <p>Over $1.5 mil­lion was raised, with more than 86,000km cov­ered.</p>
    <p>With the new for­mat, many got cre­ative by don­ning cos­tumes or run­ning un­con­ven­tional routes, like Mr Tum­mala­palli did.</p>
    <p>Mr Michael Astronomo, 39, ran about 5km of his 33km route togged out in per­sonal pro­tec­tive equip­ment (PPE). It was not to guard against the coro­n­avirus, but the rain at Mount Faber.</p>
    <p>“It was rain­ing and cold,” said Mr Astronomo. “It’s im­pos­si­ble to run the whole dis­tance wear­ing PPE.”</p>
    <p>The IT net­work and in­fras­truc­ture pro­fes­sional pro­vides sup­port such as WiFi ser­vices at the Sin­ga­pore Expo for in­di­vid­u­als and front-lin­ers in the con­verted iso­la­tion fa­cil­ity.</p>
    <p>“Even with the cur­rent Covid-19 sit­u­a­tion, I wanted to show how the fight for can­cer still goes on,” he said.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to the race web­site, 39 Sin­ga­pore­ans are di­ag­nosed with can­cer ev­ery day, while 15 die of the dis­ease each day.</p>
    <p>One in four peo­ple here may de­velop can­cer in his life­time, it said.</p>
    <p>An­nu­ally, the Sin­ga­pore Can­cer So­ci­ety needs $20 mil­lion to run its pro­grammes and ser­vices, and cre­ate new ini­tia­tives to con­tinue im­prov­ing the lives of the can­cer com­mu­nity. Over 100,000 in­di­vid­u­als ben­e­fit from the so­ci­ety’s out­reach and sup­port.</p>
    <p>MIS­SION IM­POS­SI­BLE</p>
    <p>It was rain­ing and cold... It’s im­pos­si­ble to run the whole dis­tance wear­ing PPE.</p>
