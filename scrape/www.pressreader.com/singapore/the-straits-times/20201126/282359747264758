    <p>Oil ty­coon Lim Oon Kuin, founder of trou­bled Sin­ga­porean oil trader Hin Leong, de­nied al­le­ga­tions by the com­pany’s big­gest cred­i­tor that he used forged doc­u­ments to ob­tain fi­nanc­ing.</p>
    <p>HSBC Hold­ings is su­ing Lim, his chil­dren and a Hin Leong Trad­ing em­ployee to re­cover US$85.3 mil­lion (S$114.5 mil­lion) in fi­nanc­ing that the bank al­leges they ob­tained with forged ac­cords.</p>
    <p>OK Lim, as he is known, says the doc­u­ments were “mis­tak­enly” is­sued and he was not aware of the process, and not re­spon­si­ble for HSBC’s losses. His fam­ily and the Hin Leong em­ployee also deny the ac­cu­sa­tion, ac­cord­ing to de­fence fil­ings to a lo­cal court ear­lier this month.</p>
    <p>Hin Leong’s cred­i­tors, which also in­clude DBS Group Hold­ings, are bat­tling to re­cover funds from the in­sol­vent firm in one of the big­gest com­modi­ties trad­ing scan­dals in decades. HSBC’s suit, filed in late Oc­to­ber, came two months af­ter the trader’s court-ap­pointed man­agers Price­wa­ter­house­Coop­ers took le­gal ac­tion against Lim and his fam­ily for a to­tal of US$3.5 bil­lion in out­stand­ing debt.</p>
    <p>HSBC, Europe’s largest bank, has the most ex­po­sure to Hin Leong at about US$600 mil­lion, the most among 23 banks. It did not re­spond to a re­quest for com­ment.</p>
    <p>Both of the plain­tiffs al­lege that Lim, his son Evan Lim and daugh­ter Lim Huey Ching en­gaged in fraud­u­lent trad­ing. OK Lim, who founded Hin Leong in 1963, also faces two charges of doc­u­ment forgery for pur­poses of cheat­ing, and is un­der an on­go­ing in­ves­ti­ga­tion by the Sin­ga­pore au­thor­i­ties.</p>
    <p>In the de­fence fil­ing, OK Lim’s lawyer claimed that he did not carry out the day-to-day op­er­a­tional and com­mer­cial ac­tiv­i­ties at Hin Leong and left them to the em­ploy­ees and rel­e­vant de­part­ments.</p>
    <p>Lim and his chil­dren were told on or around April 12 that the com­pany had mis­tak­enly made two re­quests to HSBC for dis­counted fi­nanc­ing ear­lier this year. They in­formed the bank the same day, say­ing the com­pany would try to re­pay the funds, said the fil­ing.</p>
    <p>Ear­lier, Lim said in an af­fi­davit that he had or­dered his em­ploy­ees to hide the losses when pre­par­ing the com­pany’s bal­ance sheets for bank ref­er­ences. “I had given in­struc­tions to the finance depart­ment to pre­pare the ac­counts with­out show­ing the losses and told them that I would be re­spon­si­ble if any­thing went wrong,” Lim said in the af­fi­davit.</p>
