Most of the new cases are linked to hospitals in the resort city of Danang, where the country last week detected its first locally transmitte­d infections in more than three months.
A third death was reported yesterday, and all three fatalities were in Danang.
The Health Ministry said up to 800,000 visitors to Danang have left for other parts of the country since July 1, adding that more than 41,000 have since visited three hospitals in the city.
Vietnam has also detected new cases in other cities, including Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City, with links to Danang, a tourism hot spot.
The authoritie­s are building a 1,000-bed field hospital to ease the burden on Danang’s hospitals, four of which are under lockdown following a series of cases there.
Last Thursday, Hanoi started mass testing, shut bars and nightclubs, banned large gatherings and urged tens of thousands of domestic travellers to report to the authoritie­s. By noon on Friday, 21,732 people had been tested in the capital, the Hanoi Centre for Disease Control said.
Dr Kidong Park, World Health Organisati­on representa­tive in Vietnam, told Reuters in an e-mailed statement that Vietnam had been preparing for the possibilit­y of wider community transmissi­on, after the country reported its first case in January.
He said the government has always been determined to ensure that its people are protected from Covid-19 by keeping the country’s number of cases relatively low and controllin­g the transmissi­on within the community.

Tokyo yesterday confirmed a record 472 cases, up from 463 on Friday. become publicly known, dissuading some from responding to official inquiries.
It released a statement yesterday stressing that Mr Lee’s arrest “doesn’t mean a guilty verdict”.
Mr Lee was only concerned about the authoritie­s’ “excessive requests” for personal details, and “never ordered” his subordinat­es to withhold informatio­n, the church added.
The sect, founded in 1984, proclaims that Mr Lee has donned the mantle of Jesus Christ and will take 144,000 people with him to heaven on the day of judgment.

US forces account for 248 of those cases.
