    <p>RACE 1 (1,000M)</p>
    <p>14 Tiger­lad has gone close on a num­ber of oc­ca­sions. He com­mands re­spect with no weight on his back. Chances are he will lead un­der Vag­ner Borges.</p>
    <p>5 Bella Baby won well first-up this cam­paign. He draws awk­wardly, but can fig­ure as the first ride for Bel­gian ace Christophe Soumil­lon. 8 Money­more is a two-time win­ner this cam­paign. He has drawn well.</p>
    <p>4 Iron King re­turns first-up off the back of an eye-catch­ing trial.</p>
    <p>RACE 2 (1,600M)</p>
    <p>9 Tai­lor Made looks like he will rel­ish the mile. From the soft gate, he can make his pres­ence felt.</p>
    <p>14 Fairy Floss slots in light with next to no weight on his back. Although he is win­less, he has put to­gether a num­ber of nice runs.</p>
    <p>2 Regency Gem needs to over­come the wide gate but gets top­form cham­pion jockey Zac Purton.</p>
    <p>3 Cir­cuit Num­ber One has mixed his form but is near­ing a win. It could well come to­mor­row.</p>
    <p>RACE 3 (1,000M)</p>
    <p>1 Forte showed plenty of fight to win on de­but. With im­prove­ment, he is ca­pa­ble of notch­ing back-to­back wins.</p>
    <p>8 In­fi­nite Power will be bet­ter af­ter his game de­but fifth.</p>
    <p>13 Vec­tor might en­joy be­ing rid­den pa­tiently from the wide draw. It would not sur­prise to see him hold up his trial form.</p>
    <p>12 Win­ner Method has abil­ity. He gets Purton for his de­but.</p>
    <p>RACE 4 (1,400M)</p>
    <p>3 Lead­ing For­tune is a two-time win­ner over this course and dis­tance in this grade. He should find him­self in the right spot un­der Joao Mor­eira.</p>
    <p>4 Su­perb Daddy is bet­ter than his re­cent record sug­gests. He is a course-and-dis­tance win­ner who will be fin­ish­ing strongly.</p>
    <p>1 Ev­ery­one’s De­light is lightly raced but tal­ented. It seems the 1,400m will suit on his last run.</p>
    <p>2 Golden Four is un­lucky not to have won more than two races. He has seven sec­onds. He is well­weighted with Al­fred Chan’s 7lb (3.18kg) ap­pren­tice claim.</p>
    <p>RACE 5 (1,200M)</p>
    <p>5 Res­o­lute is a solid dirt per­former and a course-and-dis­tance win­ner this term. He can bounce back af­ter an awk­ward run last start.</p>
    <p>10 Happy Tango closed off nicely at his first dirt try last start. Purton hops up now and he needs only to re­pro­duce his lat­est ef­fort to score.</p>
    <p>1 Su­per Red Dragon is hold­ing his con­di­tion well. He is look­ing for a hat-trick, although he is switch­ing to the dirt af­ter two wins on the grass.</p>
    <p>3 Jade Phoenix, who fin­ished fourth last start, is next best.</p>
    <p>RACE 6 (1,400M)</p>
    <p>9 Win­ning Steed is bet­ter than his record sug­gests. It would not sur­prise to see him bounce into form with Purton over tak­ing the reins. The draw suits.</p>
    <p>2 Speed Fay Fay can fin­ish strongly. He has hit a pur­ple patch and needs only a solid pace to be com­pet­i­tive.</p>
    <p>11 For­tune Master is also go­ing to fin­ish strongly un­der Mor­eira.</p>
    <p>3 So Awe­some is con­sis­tent with­out win­ning. He can fig­ure.</p>
    <p>RACE 7 (1,200M)</p>
    <p>11 Fly­ing On The Turf made solid in­roads last start be­hind the tear­away win­ner Czar­son. This is strong form. If he can repli­cate that run, he is a lead­ing chance.</p>
    <p>10 En­shrined bears close watch­ing. Chances are he will roll for­ward to try and pinch this.</p>
    <p>6 Biz Power is un­lucky not to al­ready be a win­ner. He has tri­alled well on the dirt and it should prove suit­able on race day.</p>
    <p>4 All For South is a lightly raced prospect who is open to im­prove­ment.</p>
    <p>RACE 8 (1,200M)</p>
    <p>5 Win­ning For All has abil­ity. He just needs the right run from the widest draw. This is his pre­ferred course and dis­tance.</p>
    <p>3 Pri­vate Rocket is as con­sis­tent as they come. Ap­pren­tice jockey Jerry Chau’s 7lb claim and the in­side draw will help.</p>
    <p>10 Dublin Star won over this course and dis­tance three starts ago. He has drawn well and has proven him­self up in class.</p>
    <p>12 Sky Show is in­ex­pe­ri­enced but, on his day, is a strong per­former.</p>
    <p>RACE 9 (1,600M)</p>
    <p>10 Ro­man­tic Combo nar­rowly missed over the mile last start. He is rac­ing well and can break through on his sec­ond try.</p>
    <p>3 Kyrus Uni­corn has abil­ity. He could roll for­ward from the in­side gate. He is worth sup­port­ing with the book­ing of Purton.</p>
    <p>2 Un­cle Steve is in form. He has placed in his last two starts. He is clearly rel­ish­ing the drop from Class 2 to Class 3.</p>
    <p>8 Tempest Ex­press is next best.</p>
    <p>RACE 10 (1,400M)</p>
    <p>1 Band Of Broth­ers has the class edge. This is his pre­ferred course and dis­tance. If he can shoul­der the top weight, he is the one to beat.</p>
    <p>14 Beauty Smile slots in light af­ter run­ning a blinder in Class 3 last time. He steps back into Class 2 but gets in with a light weight.</p>
    <p>2 Bal­lis­tic King, a solid per­former in Class 2, is un­lucky this sea­son with three sec­onds and a fourth from four starts.</p>
    <p>11 In­vin­ci­ble Mis­sile has drawn poorly but can be a com­pet­i­tive per­former in this grade.</p>
