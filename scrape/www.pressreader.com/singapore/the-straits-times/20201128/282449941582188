    <p>Sin­ga­pore food man­u­fac­turer Tong Gar­den saw its business in India grow over the last decade – mainly through su­per­mar­kets and gro­cery stores, where peo­ple pick up snacks like wasabi-flavoured peas, a sur­prise run­away hit among In­di­ans.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing the pan­demic, the snack and nuts com­pany has increasing­ly looked to e-com­merce.</p>
    <p>Its spokesman Huiqi Ong said: “Early on, we were on Ama­zon and BigBas­ket... Through the pan­demic, we saw sales on all our plat­forms surg­ing. That is some­thing we are thank­ful for.</p>
    <p>“We re­alised we need to put in even more to grow our pres­ence.”</p>
    <p>She noted, how­ever, that over­all sales in India had fallen by 20 per cent to 30 per cent dur­ing the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>She added: “We are re­ally fo­cused on in­creas­ing our reach and be­ing on as many plat­forms as pos­si­ble... There is a lot of po­ten­tial (in India). It’s a big mar­ket for us.”</p>
    <p>Plans to set up a manufactur­ing plant – an­nounced over two years ago – in the city of Ahmed­abad have been de­layed by the pan­demic. The plant would al­low the firm to man­u­fac­ture its prod­ucts in India and make it more com­pet­i­tive in an ex­tremely price-con­scious mar­ket.</p>
    <p>While build­ing in the midst of Covid-19 is “very chal­leng­ing”, Ms Ong said they are go­ing ahead with build­ing the fac­tory.</p>
    <p>India is the sec­ond-most af­fected coun­try in the coro­n­avirus pan­demic, with 9.31 mil­lion cases.</p>
    <p>In March, a strin­gent lock­down shut down all eco­nomic ac­tiv­ity in the coun­try, though re­stric­tions have since been eased.</p>
    <p>Still, the pan­demic has seen the middle and up­per classes increasing­ly shift on­line to buy ev­ery­thing from veg­eta­bles to daily es­sen­tials.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to Glob­al­Data, the pan­demic is ex­pected to ac­cel­er­ate India’s e-com­merce mar­ket and push its growth to hit 7 tril­lion ru­pees (S$126.5 bil­lion) by 2023.</p>
    <p>For Sin­ga­pore firms sell­ing life­style and food prod­ucts, e-com­merce has ac­quired ad­di­tional im­por­tance in business ex­pan­sion.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore firm igloohome, which makes smart locks and lock boxes, stepped up its plans to go on­line.</p>
    <p>Its direc­tor of business devel­op­ment Shalin Gaik­wad said: “We as­sisted distrib­u­tors to get on board mar­ket­places like Ama­zon and Tata Cliq by part­ner­ing with ecom­merce-fo­cused re­sellers.</p>
    <p>“This helped us tap the fes­tive pro­mo­tions dur­ing Di­wali, and we were able to list a light­ning deal on Ama­zon, which led to some un­prece­dented vol­umes dur­ing the fes­ti­val sea­son.”</p>
    <p>The firm found that while deals in the real es­tate space were put on hold, other in­dus­tries opened up, like the lo­gis­tics in­dus­try.</p>
    <p>“We de­cided to con­duct train­ing ses­sions with our distrib­u­tors and gave them case stud­ies on how to cater and pitch to this newly cre­ated stream of de­mand,” said Mr Gaik­wad.</p>
    <p>De­spite see­ing a dip in sales dur­ing the pan­demic, igloohome said it plans to in­crease its re­tail pres­ence in the five ma­jor metropoli­tan cities by March next year.</p>
    <p>En­ter­prise Sin­ga­pore (ESG), the gov­ern­ment agency cham­pi­oning en­ter­prise devel­op­ment, has spot­ted the ben­e­fit of e-com­merce for firms seek­ing to ex­pand.</p>
    <p>It re­cently con­ducted a we­bi­nar on the e-com­merce jour­ney for Sin­ga­pore com­pa­nies keen to ven­ture into India.</p>
    <p>“De­spite the chal­lenges posed by Covid-19, ESG has en­gaged with more than 40 com­pa­nies on e-com­merce op­por­tu­ni­ties in India to un­der­stand more about the op­por­tu­ni­ties and land­scape over the past few months,” said Mr Tay Lian Chew, ESG’s global mar­kets direc­tor for South Asia.</p>
    <p>“More than 47 per cent of these com­pa­nies have pro­gressed on to ac­tive dis­cus­sions with in-mar­ket distrib­u­tors and sell­ers.</p>
    <p>“The on­go­ing pan­demic, as well as trade ten­sions, has also high­lighted the im­por­tance of di­ver­si­fy­ing sup­ply chains as com­pa­nies around the world faced dis­rup­tions to the flow of ma­te­ri­als and goods.”</p>
    <p>India has a tough business en­vi­ron­ment due to red tape and reg­u­la­tory hur­dles, among other is­sues.</p>
    <p>Still, it jumped from the 130th po­si­tion in 2017 to 63rd this year in the World Bank’s Ease of Do­ing Business index.</p>
    <p>For bev­er­age firm Asia Farm, ecom­merce is its new strat­egy for India, after eight years of try­ing to crack the highly com­pet­i­tive bev­er­age sec­tor.</p>
    <p>It has sold 12,000 bot­tles of pur­ple tea on­line dur­ing the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>“We un­der­stand the India mar­ket is not re­ally easy be­cause it’s price-sen­si­tive, said Mr Wong Loke Hsien, its business man­ager.</p>
    <p>“But once you get in and the prod­uct is well ac­cepted, sales can be big be­cause of the mas­sive pop­u­la­tion.”</p>
