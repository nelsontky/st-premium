    <p>Zoom Video Com­mu­ni­ca­tions, the com­pany be­hind the nowu­biq­ui­tous video­con­fer­enc­ing plat­form Zoom, is ex­pand­ing its foot­print in Sin­ga­pore by open­ing a new re­search and devel­op­ment (R&D) cen­tre and dou­bling the size of its data cen­tre here.</p>
    <p>The US tech gi­ant, which has been in Sin­ga­pore for two years, will also hire hun­dreds of staff for the R&D cen­tre in key en­gi­neer­ing roles, it said in a state­ment yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>A Zoom spokesman told The Straits Times that the firm aims to open the R&D cen­tre by the third quar­ter of next year “or when it’s safe for all our em­ploy­ees to go back into the of­fice”.</p>
    <p>He de­clined to say how much Zoom in­vested in the new fa­cil­ity and ex­panded data cen­tre.</p>
    <p>The firm added that the ex­pan­sion in Sin­ga­pore will sup­ple­ment its ex­ist­ing R&D cen­tres in the United States, In­dia and China, and sup­port Zoom’s en­gi­neer­ing lead­er­ship team, which is based at its head­quar­ters in San Jose, Cal­i­for­nia.</p>
    <p>“Zoom se­lected Sin­ga­pore for its ex­cep­tional en­gi­neer­ing tal­ent. The com­pany has al­ready be­gun re­cruit­ing en­gi­neers in the area and looks for­ward to se­lect­ing of­fice space as pan­demic-re­lated re­mote work sub­sides,” the com­pany said.</p>
    <p>Mr Velchamy Sankar­lingam, Zoom’s pres­i­dent of prod­uct and en­gi­neer­ing, said the new R&D fa­cil­ity and ex­panded data cen­tre in Sin­ga­pore will play a crit­i­cal role in Zoom’s con­tin­ued in­ter­na­tional growth.</p>
    <p>“Sin­ga­pore is pro-busi­ness, ranks as one of the friendli­est coun­tries to set up a com­pany, and con­tin­ues to be a favourite for re­gional head­quar­ters as it boasts ex­cep­tional tal­ent, strong in­fra­struc­ture, and is a per­fect gate­way for en­gag­ing the wider Asia-Pa­cific re­gion,” he said.</p>
    <p>Mr Chng Kai Fong, man­ag­ing di­rec­tor of the Eco­nomic Devel­op­ment Board, said Zoom has trans­formed the way peo­ple work, learn and so­cialise. “In some ways, we are more pro­duc­tive and ful­filled... I am thrilled that Zoom will be part­ner­ing Sin­ga­pore to set up an R&D cen­tre to ex­plore pos­si­bil­i­ties,” he said.</p>
    <p>Other tech gi­ants have ex­panded or set up their first of­fice in Sin­ga­pore this year. They in­clude Twit­ter, WeChat owner Ten­cent Hold­ings, and Chi­nese tech gi­ant ByteDance, which owns pop­u­lar video app TikTok.</p>
