    <p>Two di­rec­tors of an event man­age­ment com­pany, who of­fered a to­tal of $2,400 in bribes to se­cure business con­tracts, were each fined $5,400 yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Aw Ke Hong, 35, and Lee Chee Wee, 36, had each ear­lier pleaded guilty to two counts of con­spir­ing to cor­ruptly give a bribe to an­other in­di­vid­ual, Liu Weide, 31.</p>
    <p>The two men had also each ad­mit­ted to two counts of con­spir­ing to make false en­tries in their com­pany’s profit and loss state­ments so as to falsely ac­count for the bribes as ex­penses.</p>
    <p>Four other sim­i­lar charges – two for giv­ing bribes to Liu and two in­volv­ing the fal­si­fi­ca­tion of fi­nan­cial state­ments – were taken into con­sid­er­a­tion dur­ing sen­tenc­ing by Senior District Judge Ong Hian Sun.</p>
    <p>At the time of their of­fences, Aw and Lee were di­rec­tors of Show Wild, an event man­age­ment com­pany that spe­cialises in IT net­work­ing and au­dio-vis­ual equip­ment so­lu­tions.</p>
    <p>Liu was the as­sis­tant man­ager of Es­sen­tial Werkz, which pro­vides IT so­lu­tions for events.</p>
    <p>Court doc­u­ments did not state if Aw, Lee and Liu are still in their re­spec­tive po­si­tions.</p>
    <p>Be­tween May 2016 and March 2017, Liu re­quested quo­ta­tions from Aw to sup­ply net­work­ing so­lu­tions for Es­sen­tial Werkz’s IT-re­lated events.</p>
    <p>In each in­stance, Liu would sub­mit Show Wild’s quo­ta­tion to his com­pany’s man­age­ment and tell Aw that Show Wild’s ser­vices would be en­gaged for the event.</p>
    <p>He would also ask for a com­mis­sion from Aw as a re­ward for rec­om­mend­ing Show Wild to be the net­work so­lu­tions sup­plier for Es­sen­tial Werkz.</p>
    <p>Each time, Aw and Lee would dis­cuss Liu’s re­quest and agree on the sum to give him.</p>
    <p>Liu re­ceived $2,400 in to­tal from Aw and Lee.</p>
    <p>To cover up the bribes, Aw made false en­tries in Show Wild’s profit and loss state­ments, ac­count­ing for the pay­ments as ex­penses.</p>
    <p>Lee was aware of the false en­tries as he checked and ap­proved these state­ments as a di­rec­tor of Show Wild.</p>
    <p>The Cor­rupt Prac­tices In­ves­ti­ga­tion Bureau (CPIB) said in a state­ment yes­ter­day that Liu was sen­tenced in June to a $3,000 fine and a $2,400 penalty.</p>
    <p>“Com­pa­nies are strongly ad­vised to put in place pro­ce­dures in ar­eas such as pro­cure­ment and in­ter­nal au­dit to re­duce the in­ci­dence of cor­rup­tion,” said CPIB.</p>
    <p>For each cor­rup­tion of­fence, Aw and Lee could have each been jailed for up to five years and/or fined up to $100,000.</p>
    <p>Each man could also have been jailed for up to 10 years and/or fined for each of­fence in­volv­ing the fal­si­fi­ca­tion of fi­nan­cial state­ments.</p>
