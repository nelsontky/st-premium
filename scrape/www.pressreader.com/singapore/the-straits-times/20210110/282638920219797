    <p>• Har­ris English is aim­ing to “keep the pedal down” as he closed with a 10-foot birdie to fire a six-un­der 67 and seize a two-stroke lead af­ter Fri­day’s sec­ond round of the US PGA Tour­na­ment of Cham­pi­ons.</p>
    <p>The Amer­i­can, 31, made six birdies in a bo­gey-free round to stand on 14-un­der 132 af­ter 36 holes on the par-73 Plan­ta­tion course at Kapalua, Hawaii.</p>
    <p>“I feel good about my game right now,” English said. “I felt like I played re­ally solid. Just didn’t hole as many putts as I did in the first round.</p>
    <p>“I drove the ball re­ally well and hit a lot of greens in reg­u­la­tion.</p>
    <p>“If I keep shoot­ing six un­der, it’s go­ing to be a good score at the end of the week. I’m go­ing to try to make as many birdies as I can. I’ve got to keep the pedal down.”</p>
    <p>Amer­i­cans Justin Thomas (69), Ryan Palmer (67), Collin Morikawa (65) and Daniel Berger (65) shared sec­ond on 134.</p>
    <p>South Korean Im Sung-jae (68) and Amer­i­cans Bren­don Todd (67), Pa­trick Reed (68) and Xan­der Schauf­fele (66) were tied for sixth on 135.</p>
    <p>World No. 1 Dustin John­son (65), in his re­turn af­ter win­ning the Mas­ters in Novem­ber, was among seven on 136 ahead of the week­end play.</p>
    <p>De­fend­ing cham­pion Thomas, ranked third, birdied the last af­ter hit­ting the flag­stick to shoot 69 and grab a share of sec­ond.</p>
    <p>Sep­a­rately, the PGA Tour Se­ries-China will not have a 2021 sea­son be­cause of the Covid-19 pan­demic, the PGA Tour said on Fri­day.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing the year, of­fi­cials from the PGA Tour Se­ries-China will dis­cuss ways of re­turn­ing to com­pet­i­tive golf and a full sched­ule of events next year.</p>
