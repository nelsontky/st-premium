    <p>Sci­en­tists have dis­cov­ered the world’s old­est trop­i­cal peat­land still in ex­is­tence in the Up­per Ka­puas Basin in In­done­sia’s part of Bor­neo. Ra­dio­car­bon dat­ing of peat cores there showed that the peat dome in West Kal­i­man­tan, a prov­ince of In­done­sia with about 1.7 mil­lion ha of peat, could have started form­ing at least 47,000 years ago. Ra­dio­car­bon dat­ing is a tech­nique com­monly used to date ar­chae­o­log­i­cal finds such as fos­sils. The study was led by re­searcher Monika Ruwaimana, who is from the eth­nic Dayak Mualang from West Kal­i­man­tan and a doc­toral stu­dent at the Univer­sity of Ore­gon. The find­ings were pub­lished in sci­en­tific jour­nal En­vi­ron­men­tal Re­search Let­ters ear­lier this month. Ms Ruwaimana said the dis­cov­ery was sur­pris­ing, as the old­est tem­per­ate peat­lands are be­tween 10,000 and 11,000 years old. Trop­i­cal peat­lands are con­sid­ered younger, with the old­est thought to be around 7,000 years old. “We pre­dicted that the peat­land in the up­per river re­gion will be older; how­ever, we did not ex­pect it to be 47,000 years old,” she added. As the dated cores did not ex­tend to the bot­tom of the peat, it could have started form­ing even ear­lier, she noted.</p>
    <p>“This peat is quite deep at be­tween 17m and 18m, which means it is an im­por­tant car­bon sink,” she said. “As peat is formed layer by layer like kueh lapis (a tra­di­tional snack), by analysing each layer, we can pre­dict how the cli­mate, fire and veg­e­ta­tion at that time were like,” said Ms Ruwaimana.</p>
