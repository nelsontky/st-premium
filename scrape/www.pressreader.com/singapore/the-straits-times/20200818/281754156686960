    <p>In­creas­ing ten­sions be­tween ma­jor pow­ers may lead to frag­men­ta­tion of global trade re­la­tions and sup­ply chains, pos­ing a unique chal­lenge to trade-de­pen­dent Sin­ga­pore’s growth out­look.</p>
    <p>But a well-diver­si­fied base of man­u­fac­tur­ing and ex­port mar­kets should help the econ­omy emerge in­tact, or even stronger, on the other side of the coro­n­avirus-in­duced re­ces­sion.</p>
    <p>A ma­jor chunk of the ex­port-ori­ented man­u­fac­tur­ing sec­tor here are sup­pli­ers of in­ter­me­di­ate goods – a rel­a­tively non-con­tro­ver­sial seg­ment in in­ter­na­tional trade com­pared with fin­ished goods. They in­clude elec­tron­ics, pre­ci­sion engi­neer­ing and phar­ma­ceu­ti­cals.</p>
    <p>The larger ones among these man­u­fac­tur­ers are multi­na­tion­als that are usu­ally as­tute at fig­ur­ing out how to live with or work around tar­iff and non-tar­iff bar­ri­ers and changes in sup­ply chains.</p>
    <p>How­ever, for smaller ven­dors, the pace of change in global trade pat­terns – ex­ag­ger­ated by the Covid-19 pan­demic – is a mat­ter of con­cern.</p>
    <p>The un­cer­tainty over how their cus­tomers would re­con­fig­ure their sup­ply chains and how they would re­spond to new trade bar­ri­ers and pro­hi­bi­tions can put their fu­ture cap­i­tal ex­pen­di­ture and mar­ket­ing plans at risk.</p>
    <p>A Moody’s In­vestors Ser­vice re­port last Tues­day pointed to the like­li­hood of sup­ply chains in many sec­tors be­com­ing shorter and less “just in time”, lead­ing to a more frag­mented global trade sys­tem with a greater range of sup­pli­ers for sim­i­lar prod­ucts and re­lo­ca­tion of some pro­duc­tion closer to home.</p>
    <p>Min­is­ter for Trade and In­dus­try Chan Chun Sing pointed out on the same day that many man­u­fac­tur­ers are shift­ing from sup­ply chain mod­els fo­cused on ef­fi­ciency, or “just in time”, to a more re­silient “just in case” model.</p>
    <p>They want to di­ver­sify their op­er­a­tions, mar­kets and sup­ply chains so they are not de­pen­dent on any one site, he added.</p>
    <p>Many ob­servers be­lieve that since the sup­ply chain shifts will be a multi-year process and de­pen­dent on ever-chang­ing geopo­lit­i­cal con­sid­er­a­tions, an el­e­ment of un­cer­tainty may arise about in­vest­ment flows into Sin­ga­pore – the re­gional head­quar­ters and pro­duc­tion base for many multi­na­tional com­pa­nies.</p>
    <p>United States-China re­la­tions have de­te­ri­o­rated rapidly across a broad range of is­sues, with both sides shut­ting down con­sulates and en­gag­ing in diplo­matic tus­sles over Hong Kong and Tai­wan.</p>
    <p>The US is also push­ing for a ban on Chi­nese tech­nol­ogy firms, in­clud­ing ByteDance, the owner of TikTok. That has kin­dled global fears of a new Cold War, drag­ging the global econ­omy deeper into re­ces­sion.</p>
    <p>The US is also con­test­ing its trade and tar­iff agree­ments with Europe and has crit­i­cised its large deficits with other trad­ing part­ners such as Ja­pan, In­dia and In­done­sia.</p>
    <p>China has also seen its trade re­la­tions frag­ment with other coun­tries in­clud­ing Ja­pan and In­dia, as well as the Euro­pean Union.</p>
    <p>The litany of dis­putes is chal­leng­ing the mul­ti­lat­er­al­ism that fos­tered glob­al­i­sa­tion and put the post-war world econ­omy on the path of un­prece­dented eco­nomic growth.</p>
    <p>There is little doubt that a rules-based, pre­dictable trad­ing sys­tem con­trib­uted sig­nif­i­cantly to trade and trade-in­duced growth in many parts of the world, espe­cially in Europe and East Asia.</p>
    <p>The ben­e­fits of an open, rules-based, mul­ti­lat­eral sys­tem go be­yond lower tar­iffs and other trade bar­ri­ers.</p>
    <p>Rules re­duce un­cer­tainty and en­cour­age much-needed in­vest­ment in de­vel­op­ing economies. They help coun­tries dis­ci­pline do­mes­tic pro­tec­tion­ist lob­bies. And they al­low pow­er­ful coun­tries to cred­i­bly com­mit not to abuse their bar­gain­ing power over smaller coun­tries, thereby pro­vid­ing in­cen­tives for the smaller na­tions to par­tic­i­pate in trade ne­go­ti­a­tions.</p>
    <p>Ja­pan, South Korea, Sin­ga­pore and Tai­wan achieved rapid eco­nomic catch-up on the back of ex­port-led growth.</p>
    <p>China has fol­lowed the same path over the past sev­eral decades.</p>
    <p>World­wide mer­chan­dise trade grew about twice as fast as global gross do­mes­tic prod­uct (GDP) from 1990 to 2008.</p>
    <p>But doubts over the merits of free trade started to emerge soon af­ter the 2008 global fi­nan­cial cri­sis. Dur­ing the cri­sis, trade col­lapsed. The world econ­omy slowly re­cov­ered af­ter 2008, but trade never re­gained its pre­vi­ous mo­men­tum.</p>
    <p>Global trade, which out­stripped GDP growth for much of the 20th cen­tury, fell be­hind it.</p>
    <p>Sev­eral ex­pla­na­tions have been sug­gested, in­clud­ing cycli­cal fac­tors, such as slug­gish de­mand – espe­cially for durable and in­vest­ment goods that are more trade-sen­si­tive – low cor­po­rate in­vest­ment and lim­ited trade fi­nanc­ing in the af­ter­math of the cri­sis.</p>
    <p>But there are two dom­i­nant ex­pla­na­tions that are struc­tural in na­ture and thus more dis­con­cert­ing as they point to long-term fac­tors that may be harder to over­come even if the cur­rent global free-trade frame­work is pre­served en­tirely.</p>
    <p>One of these ex­pla­na­tions for low global trade growth is the re­bal­anc­ing of the Chi­nese econ­omy in the past decade where it has been adding more value to its pro­duc­tion do­mes­ti­cally and low­er­ing its im­port de­pen­dence.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to the In­ter­na­tional Mon­e­tary Fund (IMF), only South Korea ex­hibits the same trend as China – an in­crease in do­mes­tic value added af­ter 2011.</p>
    <p>For all other coun­tries, the do­mes­tic value added has ei­ther re­mained con­stant or de­clined slightly, con­sis­tent with fur­ther in­te­gra­tion into global value chains.</p>
    <p>The other ex­pla­na­tion for slow­ing global trade is that the trend of break­ing up pro­duc­tion into sep­a­rate stages that are car­ried out in dif­fer­ent fac­to­ries or firms, po­ten­tially in dif­fer­ent coun­tries, has run its course.</p>
    <p>How­ever, the share of one seg­ment of global trade – in­ter­me­di­ate goods that are the sum of semi-fin­ished prod­ucts and so-called parts and com­po­nents – has con­tin­ued to in­crease at a mod­er­ate pace since the 1990s and has not shown any signs of re­ver­sal since the global fi­nan­cial cri­sis, an IMF re­port showed.</p>
    <p>The growth in parts and com­po­nents trade, espe­cially within elec­tron­ics – one of the most in­ter­na­tion­ally frag­mented sec­tors, with a 40 per cent share in parts and com­po­nents trade – is likely to sup­port Sin­ga­pore’s man­u­fac­tur­ing out­put and ex­ports.</p>
    <p>The ev­i­dence of that sup­port is in the re­cent sec­ond-quar­ter eco­nomic data.</p>
    <p>Even as the econ­omy posted a record 13.2 per cent slump in the three months to June 30, non-oil do­mes­tic ex­ports were up 6.5 per cent – ex­tend­ing the 5.4 per cent growth in the pre­vi­ous quar­ter.</p>
    <p>While over­all man­u­fac­tur­ing growth fell 0.7 per cent in the sec­ond quar­ter, elec­tronic out­put was up 2.1 per cent.</p>
    <p>Pre­ci­sion engi­neer­ing, closely as­so­ci­ated with elec­tron­ics, also ex­panded 0.6 per cent in the April to June pe­riod.</p>
    <p>Even the phar­ma­ceu­ti­cal seg­ment is likely to thrive as most of the com­pa­nies in the seg­ment are pro­duc­ers of ac­tive phar­ma­ceu­ti­cal ingredient­s, which are ba­sic raw ma­te­ri­als for a va­ri­ety of medicines.</p>
    <p>The share of one seg­ment of global trade – in­ter­me­di­ate goods that are the sum of semi-fin­ished prod­ucts and so-called parts and com­po­nents – has con­tin­ued to in­crease at a mod­er­ate pace since the 1990s and has not shown any signs of re­ver­sal since the global fi­nan­cial cri­sis, an IMF re­port showed.</p>
    <p>The growth in parts and com­po­nents trade, espe­cially within elec­tron­ics – one of the most in­ter­na­tion­ally frag­mented sec­tors, with a 40 per cent share in parts and com­po­nents trade – is likely to sup­port Sin­ga­pore’s man­u­fac­tur­ing out­put and ex­ports.</p>
