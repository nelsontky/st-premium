    <p>Be pre­pared for a wet and warm two weeks ahead, with thun­dery show­ers and hu­mid con­di­tions fore­cast on most days, said the weather­man yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>In a state­ment, the Me­te­o­ro­log­i­cal Ser­vice Sin­ga­pore (MSS) said the daily max­i­mum tem­per­a­ture over the first half of this month is fore­cast to be be­tween 32 deg C and 33 deg C, ris­ing to around 34 deg C on a few days, de­spite show­ers on most days.</p>
    <p>Warm and hu­mid nights are also fore­cast in the se­cond week of the month, with night-time tem­per­a­tures around 28 deg C, said the MSS.</p>
    <p>It said this oc­curs when the pre­vail­ing south-east winds strengthen and blow warm, hu­mid air from the sea over the land.</p>
    <p>Short-du­ra­tion mod­er­ate to heavy thun­dery show­ers are ex­pected over parts of the is­land be­tween the late morn­ing and af­ter­noon on most days, be­cause of the mon­soon rain band that is ex­pected to lie close to the equa­to­rial South-east Asia re­gion in the first fort­night of the month.</p>
    <p>One or two morn­ings will also see wide­spread thun­dery show­ers with gusty winds due to the pas­sage of Su­ma­tra squalls.</p>
    <p>MSS said the to­tal rain­fall in the first fort­night of the month is fore­cast to be above av­er­age over most parts of the is­land.</p>
    <p>The warm and wet weather is a con­tin­u­a­tion of weather pat­terns in the se­cond half of last month, which saw more rain­fall over Sin­ga­pore than the first fort­night of that month. The high­est daily tem­per­a­ture of 35.4 deg C was recorded in Ad­mi­ralty on Na­tional Day on Aug 9.</p>
    <p>There were also sev­eral nights that were warm, with tem­per­a­tures above 28 deg C, par­tic­u­larly over the south­ern, east­ern and western coastal ar­eas of the is­land.</p>
    <p>At the Changi cli­mate sta­tion, the mean monthly tem­per­a­ture for last month was 28.3 deg C, 0.4 deg C higher than the long-term av­er­age for Au­gust.</p>
    <p>Last month, about one-third of the is­land also recorded above-nor­mal rain­fall.</p>
    <p>The rain­fall recorded over Jurong area was 54 per cent above av­er­age, while that recorded in Ad­mi­ralty was 42 per cent below av­er­age.</p>
