    <p>Re­stric­tions on work­ers re­turn­ing to of­fices may be re­laxed, Man­power Min­is­ter Josephine Teo said yes­ter­day. “The multi-min­istry task force has been dis­cussing whether re­stric­tions on re­turn­ing to of­fices can be fur­ther loos­ened,” she told re­porters in Man­darin af­ter a visit to Sing­tel.</p>
    <p>Re­stric­tions on work­ers re­turn­ing to of­fices may be re­laxed, Man­power Min­is­ter Josephine Teo said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>“The multi-min­istry task force has been dis­cussing whether re­stric­tions on re­turn­ing to of­fices can be fur­ther loos­ened,” she told re­porters in Man­darin af­ter a visit to Sing­tel. “Some an­nounce­ments will be made in the near fu­ture... We need your pa­tience to wait a lit­tle bit more.”</p>
    <p>Mrs Teo’s com­ments came a day af­ter the Govern­ment an­nounced that Sin­ga­pore will move into phase three of its re­open­ing on Dec 28.</p>
    <p>In a tele­vised ad­dress to the na­tion on Mon­day, Prime Min­is­ter Lee Hsien Loong said that the per­mit­ted group size for so­cial gath­er­ings will go up from five to eight, and ca­pac­ity lim­its for pub­lic places such as malls, at­trac­tions and places of wor­ship will be in­creased.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, Mrs Teo also gave an up­date on the SGUnited Trainee­ships pro­gramme, an ini­tia­tive for fresh grad­u­ates to gain job ex­pe­ri­ence amid a weaker job mar­ket due to the Covid-19 pan­demic.</p>
    <p>More than 4,700 trainees had been placed un­der the pro­gramme as at early this month, she said. “We are now dis­cussing with MOE (Min­istry of Ed­u­ca­tion) on the fu­ture plans for the SGUnited Trainee­ships scheme,” said Mrs Teo.</p>
    <p>She also said that around 430 mid-ca­reer job seek­ers had been placed on at­tach­ments with about 170 host or­gan­i­sa­tions un­der the SGUnited Mid-Ca­reer Path­ways Pro­gramme as at early this month.</p>
    <p>Among them is Ms Michelle Wee, 54, who was for­merly work­ing in the cruise in­dus­try and is now un­der­go­ing an at­tach­ment at Sing­tel as a dig­i­tal ex­ec­u­tive, where she helps small and medium-sized en­ter­prises in their dig­i­tal­i­sa­tion.</p>
    <p>Sing­tel is look­ing to fill 800 po­si­tions across busi­ness, op­er­a­tional and tech­ni­cal roles un­der the two SGUnited pro­grammes. So far, it has filled more than half of the po­si­tions, with 79 mid-ca­reer in­di­vid­u­als and 363 fresh grad­u­ates.</p>
    <p>Mid-ca­reer in­di­vid­u­als like Ms Wee are at­tached to a com­pany for up to nine months to gain in­dus­try ex­pe­ri­ence and new skills in or­der to im­prove their em­ploy­a­bil­ity. They get a monthly train­ing al­lowance of up to $3,000, of which 80 per cent is funded by the Govern­ment.</p>
    <p>Mrs Teo said the pro­gramme is gain­ing mo­men­tum, “but not as fast as we would like”.</p>
    <p>One rea­son for this is that some com­pa­nies have had to ad­just their train­ing pro­grammes to bet­ter suit mid-ca­reer in­di­vid­u­als, who al­ready have years of ex­pe­ri­ence and skills, she said.</p>
    <p>In ad­di­tion, many mid-ca­reer job seek­ers pre­fer a job of­fer rather than join­ing an at­tach­ment pro­gramme, said Mrs Teo.</p>
    <p>“We want more em­ploy­ers and job seek­ers to take ad­van­tage of the SGUnited Mid-Ca­reer Path­ways Pro­gramme and, in do­ing so, ex­plore and make avail­able new op­tions to them­selves,” she said.</p>
