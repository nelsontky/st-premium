    <p>Mr Ab­dul Sa­mad Ab­dul Wa­hab, vice-pres­i­dent of the Na­tional Trades Union Congress (NTUC), has been put up as the labour move­ment’s choice for Nom­i­nated MP (NMP).</p>
    <p>The 48-year-old is also gen­eral sec­re­tary of the Union of Power and Gas Em­ploy­ees, which he joined in 2003. He was elected as a union leader in 2006, and has held his cur­rent post since 2015.</p>
    <p>In 2015, he also be­came part of NTUC’s cen­tral com­mit­tee. He was ap­pointed vice-pres­i­dent last year.</p>
    <p>In a state­ment yes­ter­day, NTUC said Mr Sa­mad has worked to forge strong labour-man­age­ment re­la­tions over the years.</p>
    <p>It high­lighted that he was in­stru­men­tal in the for­ma­tion of the Mar­ket De­vel­op­ment and Re­silience Scheme, launched by the En­ergy Mar­ket Au­thor­ity in 2018. The scheme is meant to help se­cure bonuses, in­cre­ments and train­ing funds for work­ers in the in­dus­try.</p>
    <p>An ad­vo­cate for work­ers’ train­ing and skills up­grad­ing, Mr Sa­mad also played a key role in set­ting up com­pany train­ing com­mit­tees with em­ploy­ers to im­ple­ment train­ing plans for work­ers in the power and gas in­dus­try.</p>
    <p>NTUC pres­i­dent Mary Liew said Mr Sa­mad is an “ex­pe­ri­enced, car­ing and ded­i­cated” union leader who un­der­stands the im­por­tance of tri­par­tism in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>“His in­puts in Par­lia­ment would be valu­able in shap­ing poli­cies that would ben­e­fit our work­ers,” she said.</p>
    <p>Mr Sa­mad said he was hon­oured by the nom­i­na­tion, and will tackle is­sues such as strength­en­ing the Sin­ga­porean core and ex­pand­ing the pro­gres­sive wage model to more sec­tors if he is ap­pointed an NMP.</p>
    <p>“With the pan­demic af­fect­ing lives and liveli­hoods, I would also fo­cus on pro­vid­ing much-needed help for our work­ers, es­pe­cially the mid­dle-in­come sand­wiched group, be it in ar­eas of em­ploy­ment, train­ing or cop­ing with the cost of liv­ing,” he said.</p>
    <p>NMPs are se­lected by an eight­mem­ber Spe­cial Se­lect Com­mit­tee chaired by Speaker of Par­lia­ment Tan Chuan-Jin.</p>
    <p>Be­sides sub­mis­sions from the pub­lic, seven func­tional groups – busi­ness and in­dus­try; the pro­fes­sions; the labour move­ment; so­cial ser­vice or­gan­i­sa­tions; civic and peo­ple sec­tor; ter­tiary ed­u­ca­tion in­sti­tu­tions; and me­dia, arts and sports or­gan­i­sa­tions – are typ­i­cally in­vited to sub­mit names of suit­able can­di­dates.</p>
    <p>The dead­line for sub­mis­sions is 4.30pm next Mon­day.</p>
    <p>Those nom­i­nated should have ren­dered dis­tin­guished pub­lic ser­vice, brought hon­our to Sin­ga­pore, or have dis­tin­guished them­selves in their re­spec­tive fields.</p>
    <p>The arts com­mu­nity has short­listed five names – mu­sic pro­ducer Ge­orge Leong, ac­tress and event host Au­drey Lim, pho­tog­ra­pher Ben­jamin Matchap, play­wright and for­mer Straits Times jour­nal­ist Na­bi­lah Said, and painter Ter­ence Tan.</p>
    <p>Mem­bers of the com­mu­nity had till 11.59pm last night to vote for their pre­ferred nom­i­nees.</p>
    <p>Mr Matchap said in a Face­book post yes­ter­day that he was with­draw­ing his can­di­dacy, and voiced his sup­port for Ms Na­bi­lah.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore’s green groups will nom­i­nate re­search sci­en­tist Andie Ang from the Wildlife Re­serves Sin­ga­pore Con­ser­va­tion Fund as their choice for NMP.</p>
