    <p>A mover, who was sen­tenced to 5½ years’ jail and six strokes of the cane last year over his role in the as­sault of a beauty queen’s lover, will be spend­ing an ad­di­tional 3½ years be­hind bars af­ter he re­of­fended while on bail.</p>
    <p>Ong Hock Chye, now 50, will be serv­ing his lat­est sen­tence af­ter com­plet­ing his ear­lier one.</p>
    <p>He had pleaded guilty ear­lier this year to of­fences in­clud­ing one count of ri­ot­ing. A district court heard yes­ter­day that he can no longer be caned due to his age.</p>
    <p>Ong was the mid­dle­man in the at­tack on ban­quet waiter Joshua Koh Kian Yong, then 35, in 2016.</p>
    <p>Mr Koh was then dat­ing 27-yearold Au­drey Chen Ying Fang, who won the Miss Mermaid beauty pageant that year and was also the mis­tress of mar­ried busi­ness­man Lim Hong Liang at the time.</p>
    <p>Lim Hong Liang wanted his nephew Ron Lim De Mai, then 26, to “teach Joshua a les­son”.</p>
    <p>Ron Lim roped in Ong to re­cruit oth­ers to carry out the task.</p>
    <p>On April 30, 2016, Mr Koh was hav­ing sup­per with Ms Chen at Huay Kwang Thai Kitchen in Town­shend Road near Lit­tle In­dia when a group of men am­bushed him.</p>
    <p>He was punched in the head and as he tried to run, he was slashed</p>
    <p>with a penknife on his arm and face. Mr Koh was left with a fa­cial scar that is likely to be per­ma­nent.</p>
    <p>Ron Lim was sen­tenced to three years’ jail with four strokes of the cane in 2018.</p>
    <p>His un­cle and Ong were found guilty in April last year of their roles in the at­tack. The fol­low­ing month, Lim Hong Liang, then 55, was sen­tenced to six years’ jail, while Ong was sen­tenced to 5½ years’ jail and six strokes of the cane.</p>
    <p>Ong was later re­leased on bail as he in­tended to ap­peal against District Judge Chay Yuen Fatt’s de­ci­sion. His ap­peal has since been dis­missed.</p>
    <p>While out on bail, Ong com­mit­ted ri­ot­ing with five other men at a Keong Saik Road res­tau­rant near Chi­na­town on Jan 14 this year.</p>
    <p>The court heard that Ong’s friend Lock Soh Hock, 71, had a dis­pute with Mr Koh Teck Soon, 41, at around 3pm that day. Lock called Ong and said he had been beaten up.</p>
    <p>Ong agreed to help Lock and roped in four other men. The six men later con­fronted Mr Koh Teck Soon at the res­tau­rant and as­saulted him.</p>
    <p>The out­come of the cases in­volv­ing Ong’s ac­com­plices were not stated in court doc­u­ments.</p>
    <p>Of­fend­ers con­victed of ri­ot­ing can be jailed for up to seven years and caned.</p>
