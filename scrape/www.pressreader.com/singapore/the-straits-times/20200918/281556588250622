    <p>China has lodged a com­plaint with the United States and will make a “nec­es­sary re­sponse” to an Amer­i­can of­fi­cial’s visit to Tai­wan, the Chi­nese For­eign Min­istry said ahead of his ar­rival in the is­land for a me­mo­rial ser­vice for for­mer pres­i­dent Lee Teng-hui.</p>
    <p>TAIPEI • China will make a “nec­es­sary re­sponse” to a visit by US Un­der­sec­re­tary for Eco­nomic Af­fairs Keith Krach to Tai­wan, and has lodged a com­plaint with the US, the Chi­nese for­eign min­istry said yes­ter­day, ahead of his ar­rival.</p>
    <p>Two Chi­nese anti-sub­ma­rine air­craft flew into Tai­wan’s air de­fence iden­ti­fi­ca­tion zone on Wed­nes­day and were warned to leave by Tai­wan’s air force, the is­land’s de­fence min­istry said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>When US Health Sec­re­tary Alex Azar vis­ited Tai­wan last month, the high­est-level US of­fi­cial to visit the is­land since Wash­ing­ton switched diplo­matic recog­ni­tion to Bei­jing in 1979, Chi­nese air force jets briefly crossed the mid-line of the Tai­wan Strait and were tracked by Tai­wanese mis­siles.</p>
    <p>Mr Krach, who landed in Taipei yes­ter­day af­ter­noon, is in Tai­wan for a me­mo­rial ser­vice tomorrow for for­mer pres­i­dent Lee Teng-hui, who was seen as the fa­ther of Tai­wan’s democ­racy.</p>
    <p>Mr Krach is ex­pected to meet Tai­wan Pres­i­dent Tsai Ing-wen to­day.</p>
    <p>In Bei­jing, Chi­nese For­eign Min­istry spokesman Wang Wen­bin said China has lodged “stern rep­re­sen­ta­tions” with Wash­ing­ton about Mr Krach’s trip, and that it op­posed any of­fi­cial ex­changes be­tween the United States and Tai­wan.</p>
    <p>The visit will give suc­cour to the forces of Tai­wan in­de­pen­dence and dam­age Sino-US ties, Mr Wang said.</p>
    <p>“We urge the US side to fully recog­nise the ex­treme sen­si­tiv­ity of the Tai­wan is­sue,” Mr Wang said.</p>
    <p>“China will make a nec­es­sary re­sponse de­pend­ing on how the sit­u­a­tion de­vel­ops,” he added, but did not give de­tails.</p>
    <p>Re­la­tions be­tween China and the United States have nose­dived in re­cent months, with dis­agree­ments over Tai­wan, trade, China’s im­po­si­tion of a na­tional se­cu­rity law on Hong Kong, Bei­jing’s han­dling of the coron­avirus pan­demic, and other is­sues.</p>
    <p>China views Tai­wan as a break­away prov­ince, to be re­united by force if needed. Bei­jing con­sid­ers any of­fi­cial US-Tai­wan ex­change a breach of the one-China pol­icy.</p>
    <p>Ms Tsai, who is from the pro-in­de­pen­dence Demo­cratic Pro­gres­sive Party, has said that Tai­wan is al­ready an in­de­pen­dent coun­try called the Re­pub­lic of China – Tai­wan’s for­mal name.</p>
    <p>Mr Krach is also likely to hold at least some form of trade talks dur­ing his trip, though de­tails have not been an­nounced.</p>
    <p>The US re­cently said it is es­tab­lish­ing a new bi­lat­eral eco­nomic di­a­logue with Tai­wan.</p>
    <p>Tai­wan has long sought a free trade deal with the US, but Wash­ing­ton has com­plained about bar­ri­ers to ac­cess for US pork and beef.</p>
    <p>A day ahead of Mr Krach’s visit, Tai­wan’s For­eign Min­is­ter Joseph Wu urged the in­ter­na­tional com­mu­nity to help de­fend Tai­wan and the re­gion against “ex­pan­sion­ist” Chi­nese moves, say­ing Taipei feared Bei­jing would re­sort to force.</p>
    <p>Tai­wan was “on the front line de­fend­ing democ­ra­cies from be­ing taken over by the com­mu­nist China” and needed help from other gov­ern­ments, he told the France 24 TV sta­tion on Wed­nes­day.</p>
    <p>Mr Wu also said China “has been in­ten­si­fy­ing its mil­i­tary threat against Tai­wan” in re­cent years and had stepped up mil­i­tary ex­er­cises in the re­gion.</p>
    <p>More than 30 Chi­nese mil­i­tary planes have re­cently crossed into Tai­wan’s air de­fence iden­ti­fi­ca­tion zone, he said, describing this as “very threat­en­ing”.</p>
    <p>He added that a war with China “can be a real pos­si­bil­ity if you look at the Chi­nese way of threat­en­ing Tai­wan”.</p>
    <p>Chi­nese For­eign Min­istry spokesman Wang Wen­bin (left) said China has lodged “stern rep­re­sen­ta­tions” with Wash­ing­ton about Mr Krach’s trip, and that it op­posed any of­fi­cial ex­changes be­tween the United States and Tai­wan.</p>
