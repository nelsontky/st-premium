    <p>YANGON • More than half the polling sta­tions ini­tially planned in con­flict-torn Rakhine for Myan­mar’s Nov 8 elec­tion will no longer op­er­ate, as parts of the state are too un­sta­ble for vot­ing, the coun­try’s elec­tion com­mit­tee has said.</p>
    <p>The re­gion – where most par­lia­men­tary seats are held by Rakhine na­tion­al­ist op­po­nents of Myan­mar’s de facto leader Aung San Suu Kyi – has been be­set by an eth­nic in­sur­gency that has in­ten­si­fied this year.</p>
    <p>The rul­ing Na­tional League for Democ­racy said three of its can­di­dates were ab­ducted in Rakhine while cam­paign­ing last Wed­nes­day. Po­lice did not re­spond to re­quests for com­ment, and in­sur­gents from the Arakan Army mil­i­tant group made no state­ment.</p>
    <p>Some ar­eas “are not in a po­si­tion to hold a free and fair elec­tion”, the com­mit­tee an­nounced in a state­ment late on Fri­day.</p>
    <p>There will be no vot­ing in nine of 17 town­ships in Rakhine, ac­cord­ing to the state­ment, while an­other four will have min­i­mal vot­ing.</p>
    <p>“This has a huge im­pact on us. We have only a few spots for vot­ing left,” said Mr Myo Kyaw, a spokesman for the Arakan League for Democ­racy, one of the ma­jor par­ties in Rakhine.</p>
    <p>“There is no such thing as a 100 per cent free and fair elec­tion. The elec­tion this year is worse than the oth­ers be­fore it.”</p>
    <p>The eth­nic Rakhine Arakan Na­tional Party’s (ANP) sec­re­tary Tun Aung Kyaw said the de­ci­sion to can­cel the vote had been taken for po­lit­i­cal rather than se­cu­rity rea­sons.</p>
    <p>“Most town­ships in Rakhine state where elec­tions will not be held are ar­eas the ANP would def­i­nitely win, so this is a de­lib­er­ate ploy,” he said, adding that it was dis­crim­i­na­tion against eth­nic mi­nori­ties.</p>
    <p>In the last elec­tion in 2015, the ANP won most of the seats for Rakhine state and had the third-high­est num­ber of votes na­tion­wide. It seeks a fed­eral sys­tem in Myan­mar, with more power for its states.</p>
    <p>Rakhine drew the eyes of the world in 2017 when over 730,000 Ro­hingya fled to neigh­bour­ing Bangladesh dur­ing a mil­i­tary crack­down, a cam­paign that United Na­tions in­ves­ti­ga­tors said was car­ried out with “geno­ci­dal in­tent”. The army said it was re­spond­ing to at­tacks by Ro­hingya in­sur­gents.</p>
    <p>The cur­rent con­flict is be­ing waged by the Arakan Army, which is fight­ing for greater au­ton­omy for the western re­gion. Its re­cruits are largely Bud­dhists, who make up most of the pop­u­la­tion of Rakhine as well as Myan­mar.</p>
    <p>Op­po­si­tion par­ties have urged Myan­mar’s govern­ment to post­pone the elec­tion be­cause of surg­ing coro­n­avirus in­fec­tions and a ris­ing death toll, but Ms Suu Kyi has said the bal­lot must go ahead.</p>
    <p>The move could have a “huge im­pact on the po­lit­i­cal dy­nam­ics of Rakhine,” warned Mr Sai Ye Kyaw Swar Myint, ex­ec­u­tive direc­tor of Peo­ple’s Al­liance for Cred­i­ble Elec­tions, a mon­i­tor­ing or­gan­i­sa­tion.</p>
