    <p>Some days, I like to pre­tend I am Mag­gie Che­ung. There is a scene in the clas­sic film In The Mood For Love (2000) in which she buys noo­dles from a street stall.</p>
    <p>Clad in a gor­geous cheongsam, she de­scends in slow mo­tion, take­away con­tainer in hand. A plain­tive violin sounds as she waits for her noo­dles, dab­bing per­spi­ra­tion del­i­cately from her fore­head.</p>
    <p>In this mo­ment, she is what I as­pire to be, which is to say, ridicu­lously well-dressed while rep­ping sus­tain­able pack­ag­ing.</p>
    <p>Like Che­ung, I was down at the hawker cen­tre to tar pau noo­dles, but since my life is not a Wong Kar Wai movie, I was in a tank top and shorts, sweat­ing pro­fusely into my face mask.</p>
    <p>I did, how­ever, have a tingkat, though the stall­holder baulked when I asked if she could put my ban mian in it in­stead of in a sin­gle-use plas­tic con­tainer.</p>
    <p>“You have to pack it your­self,” she said in Man­darin. “Soup or dry?”</p>
    <p>“Soup,” I said, like the dare­devil I was.</p>
    <p>Like many things I own, the tingkat is vin­tage, which meant I spent half a minute wrestling with the cover, while those queue­ing be­hind me rolled their eyes.</p>
    <p>When the soup came, it had heated the metal con­tainer to fin­ger­tip-scald­ing tem­per­a­tures. With a pained ric­tus, I ma­noeu­vred it back into the tingkat un­der the stall­holder’s crit­i­cal gaze. I be­gan to feel like I was Mu­lan at the match­maker’s, trans­fer­ring hot liq­uid into tra­di­tional ves­sels with my fam­ily’s hon­our at stake.</p>
    <p>At the be­gin­ning of the year, I thought I had my zero-waste rou­tine down pat. I had Rus­sian-doll Tup­per­ware for eat­ing din­ner at my desk, a flask for cof­fee and three types of re­us­able straws for bub­ble tea. There was so much cut­lery in my bag that I jin­gled ev­ery­where I went, like an itin­er­ant tinker.</p>
    <p>Then came Covid-19, my stay-home no­tice and the cir­cuit breaker. In those two months, I fear I un­did all the waste sav­ings I had ac­crued be­fore and then some.</p>
    <p>Since we could not go out, ev­ery­thing had to come to us and it did so in sin­gle-use pack­ag­ing. Plas­tic bags, plas­tic boxes, plas­tic cups. We wrote “no cut­lery needed” in spe­cial instructio­n boxes and were ig­nored. Ev­ery night, we guiltily bagged our trash and tried not to think of what it would be do­ing for the next thou­sand years.</p>
    <p>I told my­self to let it go. This was a pan­demic, it was an emer­gency; I was legally un­able to ven­ture be­yond my front door on pain of be­ing fined $10,000, jailed for up to six months, or both. Surely, I could get a free pass this time.</p>
    <p>But the pan­demic went on. We con­tin­ued to work from home and or­der in. The plas­tic con­tin­ued to pile up.</p>
    <p>In June, a survey done by alumni from the Na­tional Univer­sity of Sin­ga­pore’s Master of Sci­ence (En­vi­ron­men­tal Man­age­ment) pro­gramme found that take­away and de­liv­ery meals gen­er­ated an ex­tra 1,334 tonnes of plas­tic waste dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker pe­riod be­tween April 7 and June 1.</p>
    <p>This was equiv­a­lent to the weight of 92 double-decker buses, the study said.</p>
    <p>And this was just meals. There is also on­line-shop­ping pack­ag­ing to con­tend with, amid other types of waste that spike when a so­ci­ety re­con­fig­ures it­self to have ev­ery­thing it needs sent to its doorstep.</p>
    <p>House­holds and trade premises gen­er­ated 73,000 tonnes of rub­bish in April, 11 per cent more than in March, said the Na­tional En­vi­ron­ment Agency.</p>
    <p>This comes on the heels of the Gov­ern­ment’s Zero Waste Master­plan, re­leased last year, which es­ti­mates that the amount of waste dis­posed of here in­creased sev­en­fold over the last 40 years.</p>
    <p>If 2019 was meant to be Sin­ga­pore’s Year To­wards Zero Waste, 2020 is the Year Of The Dis­pos­ables. How else to de­scribe a time in which fear of con­tam­i­na­tion is so great that it has en­shrined sin­gle-use as a virtue?</p>
    <p>Writer Diana Rahim dwelt on this in her piece, A List Of Things That Can Still Travel Great Dis­tances, part of a Na­tional Arts Coun­cil­com­mis­sioned part­ner­ship with The Straits Times.</p>
    <p>“Months af­ter peo­ple first started wear­ing masks as part of their daily ar­mour against the virus, care­lessly dis­carded masks be­gan ap­pear­ing on shores thou­sands of kilo­me­tres af­ter a long jour­ney by sea,” she wrote.</p>
    <p>“Many moons into the fu­ture, those pick­ing through the time cap­sule of our dis­pos­ables... will see the wave of crum­pled blue and know that for a time, we went through a pan­demic. They will won­der, but will never fully know, the ways we took care of each other. They will have their the­o­ries.”</p>
    <p>In some cases, dis­pos­abil­ity is a mat­ter of life and death, as with sur­gi­cal masks and per­sonal pro­tec­tive equip­ment.</p>
    <p>This is hard to com­pro­mise on, al­though there have been ad­vance­ments, like Philip­pine com­pany Salay Hand­made Prod­ucts In­dus­tries’ biodegrad­able masks made from raw abaca leaf fi­bres.</p>
    <p>But since Covid-19 does not seem to be go­ing any­where, it seems as good a time as any to relook waste pro­duc­tion in other as­pects of the new nor­mal.</p>
    <p>I re­cently got a sub­scrip­tion for barePack, which, for $5 a month, lets you take away food and drinks in re­us­able con­tain­ers at cer­tain ven­dors and drop the con­tain­ers back at var­i­ous out­lets af­ter you have washed them.</p>
    <p>Since most of the ven­dors on board are not restau­rants I live near or eat at reg­u­larly, all I have done with barePack so far is drink my favourite bub­ble tea (Woobbee pink grape­fruit Yakult tea with nata de coco) in a re­us­able cup, though I had to sup­ply my own straw.</p>
    <p>Un­for­tu­nately, barePack’s de­liv­ery op­tions re­main lim­ited and it is not yet wide­spread enough to be of much use to me.</p>
    <p>What en­ter­prises like it hope to achieve is a cir­cu­lar econ­omy, a sus­tain­able closed loop in which noth­ing is dis­carded.</p>
    <p>Cir­cu­lar economies can take off, how­ever, only if they are in­te­grated into the sys­tem, be­com­ing so wide­spread and cost-ef­fec­tive as to be sec­ond na­ture to con­sumers.</p>
    <p>Would it be pos­si­ble to in­cen­tivise a similar sys­tem across food cen­tres, where peo­ple could re­turn take­away con­tain­ers to main col­lec­tion points, like trays or li­brary books? If it were large-scale enough, its costs could be out­weighed by the sav­ings on dis­pos­ables.</p>
    <p>It is dif­fi­cult to shift habits, but if the pan­demic has taught us any­thing, it is how adapt­able we are. We had to be forced for our own good to work from home, to wear masks out­doors, to check in with SafeEn­try ev­ery­where we went – but now it is the norm.</p>
    <p>There was a mo­ment of panic early in the pan­demic, when it seemed like there were not enough masks to go around, when food sell­ers grap­pled with a short­age of take­away con­tain­ers be­cause of the spike in de­mand.</p>
    <p>More than half a year in, it feels like we have al­ready for­got­ten that feel­ing. But we should not, be­cause that is how it will come round again.</p>
    <p>To ab­stain per­fectly from dis­pos­ables is a lot to ask of an in­di­vid­ual in th­ese times. I con­tinue to strug­gle with it and quite of­ten I fail. But it is only with many in­di­vid­u­als try­ing, each in their own im­per­fect way, to change their habits, that nov­el­ties be­come sys­tems.</p>
    <p>Back home, I opened my tingkat. Amid all the ex­cite­ment, they got my or­der wrong and I had not no­ticed. But the noo­dles were springy, the soup was warm and there was no plas­tic in sight. My days of be­ing waste-free, I hoped, were back on the hori­zon.</p>
