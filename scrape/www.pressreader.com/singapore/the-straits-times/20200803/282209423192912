    <p>So­ci­ete Gen­erale is clos­ing its Sin­ga­pore trade com­mod­ity fi­nance unit af­ter the col­lapse of Hin Leong Trad­ing prompted the bank to halt fresh fund­ing to such firms in the re­gion.</p>
    <p>The bank is dis­miss­ing all front of­fice staff deal­ing with trans­ac­tions, but keep­ing some ad­min­is­tra­tive work­ers, said peo­ple with knowl­edge of the mat­ter, who asked not to be iden­ti­fied.</p>
    <p>Large Asian com­modi­ties trad­ing clients with op­er­a­tions in Sin­ga­pore will now be han­dled by Hong Kong, the peo­ple said.</p>
    <p>SocGen is cut­ting ties with Sin­ga­pore-based small and medium com­modi­ties trad­ing firms.</p>
    <p>It was among more than 20 Sin­ga­pore and in­ter­na­tional banks owed US$3.8 bil­lion (S$5.2 bil­lion) by oil trader Hin Leong, which filed for cred­i­tor pro­tec­tion this year af­ter crude prices crashed.</p>
    <p>The French bank, which was owed US$240 mil­lion (S$330 mil­lion) by the firm, later de­cided to freeze the al­lo­ca­tion of new funds to oil traders in the Asia-Pa­cific.</p>
    <p>“Nat­u­ral re­sources fi­nanc­ing is one of So­ci­ete Gen­erale’s core ex­per­tise,” the bank said in a state­ment last Fri­day. “The bank is and will re­main com­mit­ted to the trade com­mod­ity fi­nance sec­tor, in­clud­ing in Asia.</p>
    <p>“So­ci­ete Gen­erale con­tin­u­ously adapts its set-up to bet­ter serve its global and lo­cal clients and lever­ages its pres­ence and strengths in Asia to bring prox­im­ity and ap­pro­pri­ate so­lu­tions to its clients.”</p>
    <p>SocGen posted a sur­prise firstquar­ter loss as its in­vest­ment bank­ing unit set aside €342 mil­lion (S$554 mil­lion) for risky as­sets in the pe­riod, in part re­lated to two fraud-re­lated charges. SocGen did not iden­tify the cases but said it may have to pro­vi­sion more over the re­main­der of the year.</p>
    <p>Plum­met­ing oil prices and ris­ing bank­rupt­cies are forc­ing French lenders to re­view their trade com­mod­ity fi­nanc­ing ac­tiv­i­ties.</p>
    <p>Last month, Natixis said it was merg­ing its in­fra­struc­ture and com­modi­ties op­er­a­tions in a move planned be­fore the coro­n­avirus pan­demic but which was ac­cel­er­ated in re­cent months.</p>
    <p>Banks were al­ready pulling back from com­modi­ties in Asia be­fore the chaos trig­gered by the coro­n­avirus. Over the past few years, the in­dus­try has been rocked by a num­ber of high-pro­file col­lapses and scan­dals, in­clud­ing mul­ti­mil­lion-dol­lar losses by some ma­jor Chi­nese and Ja­panese traders, and the spec­tac­u­lar down­fall of No­ble Group, one of the big­gest names in the in­dus­try.</p>
    <p>Trade fi­nance is the lifeblood of the global com­mod­ity trad­ing in­dus­try, which needs ac­cess to hun­dreds of bil­lions of dol­lars to fund the buy­ing, blend­ing, stor­ing and trans­port­ing of raw ma­te­ri­als. With­out ac­cess to short-term credit, traders’ busi­nesses would all but col­lapse.</p>
    <p>HSBC Hold­ings, the big­gest bank cred­i­tor to Hin Leong, has said it booked sub­stan­tial loan loss pro­vi­sions from an ex­po­sure to oil traders that amounted to US$2 bil­lion in the first quar­ter. Dutch lender ABN Amro is the se­cond-largest cred­i­tor af­ter HSBC, ac­cord­ing to a draft copy of Hin Leong’s pre­sen­ta­tion for bank cred­i­tors ear­lier this year seen by Bloomberg News</p>
