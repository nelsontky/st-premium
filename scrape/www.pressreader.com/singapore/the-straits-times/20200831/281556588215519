    <p>Sin­ga­pore’s down­town is an area where the au­thor­i­ties could take away road space from cars for pub­lic buses, cy­clists or pedes­tri­ans, said trans­port ex­perts. Do­ing so would bring about mul­ti­ple ben­e­fits, such as re­vi­tal­is­ing street level re­tail and mak­ing pub­lic trans­port smoother and more at­trac­tive, they said.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore’s down­town is an area where the au­thor­i­ties could take away road space from cars to make way for pub­lic buses, cy­clists or pedes­tri­ans, said trans­port ex­perts.</p>
    <p>Do­ing so would bring about mul­ti­ple ben­e­fits, such as re­vi­tal­is­ing street-level re­tail and mak­ing pub­lic trans­port smoother and more at­trac­tive, they added.</p>
    <p>They were giv­ing their take on plans by the Min­istry of Trans­port (MOT) to make use of the op­por­tu­nity pro­vided by the Covid-19 pan­demic to reimag­ine road in­fra­struc­ture here. Trans­port Min­is­ter Ong Ye Kung said the pan­demic has re­duced traf­fic and led to new travel pat­terns, giv­ing rise to the pos­si­bil­ity of con­vert­ing un­der-utilised road lanes into cy­cling or bus lanes.</p>
    <p>There could be scope to pedes­tri­anise some roads, he said, with­out giv­ing spe­cific ex­am­ples.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore Univer­sity of So­cial Sci­ences trans­port econ­o­mist Wal­ter Th­e­seira sug­gested that the down­town core area would be a plau­si­ble lo­ca­tion to re­claim road lanes, though he noted the dif­fi­culty of iden­ti­fy­ing which roads could be con­verted with­out ac­cess to road­use data from the au­thor­i­ties.</p>
    <p>He pointed to how the Govern­ment has re­claimed road lanes from Ben­coolen Street – Sin­ga­pore’s first tran­sit pri­or­ity cor­ri­dor that pri­ori­tises buses – and said the down­town is a lo­cal area to do so as “it has ex­cel­lent pub­lic trans­port con­nec­tiv­ity ”.</p>
    <p>On roads that could be pedes­tri­anised, he floated smaller roads like Ann Siang Hill near Chi­na­town as pos­si­bil­i­ties. “The smaller roads in the down­town core are largely just</p>
    <p>used for park­ing now and ac­cess­ing the re­tail shops there. With dis­trict park­ing and pub­lic trans­port, peo­ple don’t need to drive down those roads,” he said.</p>
    <p>Mr Leow Bok Wee, a smart mo­bil­ity con­sul­tant at Ver­tix Asia-Pa­cific, said it will be pos­si­ble to take away road space at ar­eas like the cen­tral busi­ness dis­trict where pub­lic trans­port is widely ac­ces­si­ble.</p>
    <p>But he added that the au­thor­i­ties should con­duct traf­fic im­pact as­sess­ments and sim­u­la­tions be­fore mak­ing such a move.</p>
    <p>In heart­land ar­eas, the au­thor­i­ties have taken away road space for cy­cling paths in cer­tain places, for in­stance, at a 100m stretch along Je­la­pang Road in Bukit Pan­jang.</p>
    <p>But Dr Th­e­seira said it could be harder to do so more widely, given that roads in heart­land ar­eas are gen­er­ally im­por­tant ones that al­low for move­ment through the town.</p>
    <p>Mr Kelvin Foo, man­ag­ing di­rec­tor of traf­fic and trans­port con­sul­tancy TTS Group, reck­ons it would be dif­fi­cult to find roads that are un­der-used as these are usu­ally planned on the ba­sis that they will be well used. “Roads that are not well used are in ar­eas like Lim Chu Kang, or (if they are) in ar­eas that are a bit se­cluded, they are there for es­sen­tial rea­sons.”</p>
    <p>Mr Foo added that any move to take away road space should be done grad­u­ally, and in tan­dem with other poli­cies such as re­duc­ing the ve­hi­cle pop­u­la­tion.</p>
    <p>He also noted that it would be chal­leng­ing to plan per­ma­nent schemes based on the cur­rent Covid-19 sit­u­a­tion, as traf­fic vol­umes could re­turn to pre­vi­ous lev­els af­ter the pan­demic is over.</p>
    <p>Mr Leow said his firm has ob­served up to a 30 per cent drop in traf­fic vol­umes around Sin­ga­pore com­pared with be­fore Covid-19, but the gap has been nar­row­ing.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, trans­port econ­o­mist Michael Li sug­gested that the au­thor­i­ties con­sider hav­ing bus lanes on busy roads as well, to im­prove pub­lic bus com­mutes. “This would ben­e­fit both commuters and bus op­er­a­tors who will en­joy quick turn­around tim­ings,” said Dr Li.</p>
    <p>Dr Th­e­seira said the au­thor­i­ties have been ex­plor­ing al­ter­na­tive uses for road space that sup­port dif­fer­ent forms of mo­bil­ity for some time, but the lower travel de­mand due to Covid-19 has pro­vided an op­por­tu­nity for them to pos­si­bly bring some of these plans for­ward.</p>
    <p>Last Thurs­day, Mr Ong also said the growth in telecom­mut­ing and stag­gered work­ing hours due to the pan­demic has cre­ated more sus­tain­able travel pat­terns. MOT will look into mak­ing some of these changes per­ma­nent, he added.</p>
    <p>Trans­port in­fra­struc­ture ex­pert Ray­mond Ong from the Na­tional Univer­sity of Sin­ga­pore said such changes, if pushed through, will re­duce pas­sen­ger loads on trains. This will in turn lead to less wear and tear of both trains and rails, which will bring down main­te­nance costs. He added that the changes will also give op­er­a­tors lee­way to op­ti­mise train fre­quen­cies and thus fur­ther man­age costs.</p>
    <p>Bis­han-Toa Payoh GRC MP Sak­tiandi Su­paat, chair­man of the Govern­ment Par­lia­men­tary Com­mit­tee for Trans­port, said the sug­ges­tion was fea­si­ble.</p>
    <p>He added: “We have to move fast on this to en­cour­age some of these work com­mut­ing pat­terns... and to make it com­fort­able for commuters... so they can be more pro­duc­tive at the end des­ti­na­tions for work and family.”</p>
