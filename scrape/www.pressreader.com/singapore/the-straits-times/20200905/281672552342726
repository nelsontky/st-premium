    <p>Self-em­ployed per­sons af­fected by the Covid-19 pan­demic may see an ex­ten­sion of the i ncome re­lief scheme to tide them over this pe­riod of eco­nomic un­cer­tainty.</p>
    <p>Man­power Min­is­ter Josephine Teo told Par­lia­ment yes­ter­day her min­istry will study the pos­si­bil­ity of ex­tend­ing the Self-Em­ployed Per­son In­come Re­lief Scheme (Sirs) with the Min­istry of Fi­nance.</p>
    <p>She noted that Deputy Prime Min­is­ter Heng Swee Keat said l ast month that the Gov­ern­ment is study­ing how to help the most vul­ner­a­ble work­ers and self-em­ployed per­sons be­yond ex­ist­ing schemes.</p>
    <p>Mrs Teo was re­spond­ing to Peo­ple’s Ac­tion Party MP Cheng Li Hui (Tampines GRC) and Work­ers’ Party MP Den­nis Tan (Hougang) on whether the scheme will be ex­tended in the light of the poor eco­nomic out­look.</p>
    <p>Mr Tan said with the ex­panded Covid-19 Sup­port Grant, he has re­ceived feed­back that Sirs could be ex­tended on at least a lower pay­out level, as many self-em­ployed per­sons still have fi­nan­cial dif­fi­cul­ties.</p>
    <p>The scheme, which was an­nounced by DPM Heng in the Re­silience Bud­get in March, pro­vides el­i­gi­ble self-em­ployed per­sons with $9,000 in cash over nine months.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, Ms Cheng asked how much money had been given out un­der Sirs so far, and the rea­sons for re­ject­ing ap­peals un­der the scheme.</p>
    <p>Mrs Teo said about 190,000 peo­ple re­ceived the first two pay­outs of $3,000 each in May and July, with the last pay­out due next month.</p>
    <p>Of this num­ber, 100,000 qual­i­fied au­to­mat­i­cally for the scheme, while the re­main­ing 90,000 qual­i­fied through ap­pli­ca­tion.</p>
    <p>She added that the pro­file of Sirs re­cip­i­ents mir­rors the pro­file of self-em­ployed per­sons in Sin­ga­pore, with a large num­ber be­ing taxi driv­ers, and oth­ers be­ing pri­vate-hire driv­ers and hawk­ers.</p>
    <p>So far, more than $1.1 bil­lion has been given out, in the first two pay­outs, and with the fi­nal pay­out next month, Sirs is ex­pected to cost the Gov­ern­ment $2 bil­lion in to­tal, said Mrs Teo. An ini­tial $1.2 bil­lion was set aside for the scheme when it was first an­nounced.</p>
    <p>Mrs Teo said more than four in five Sin­ga­pore­ans with tax­able in­come, and about nine in 10 of those liv­ing in pub­lic and pri­vate prop­er­ties they own are el­i­gi­ble for the scheme. The spouse’s in­come is also con­sid­ered in an ap­pli­cant’s el­i­gi­bil­ity.</p>
    <p>Of the to­tal ap­pli­ca­tions re­ceived, about two in three have been ap­proved, said Mrs Teo, adding that flex­i­bil­ity was ex­er­cised in the qual­i­fy­ing cri­te­ria in or­der to sup­port more self-em­ployed per­sons.</p>
    <p>The re­main­ing ap­pli­ca­tions were re­jected be­cause ap­pli­cants were either earn­ing much higher in­come, or are res­i­dents in high-value prop­er­ties or owned two or more prop­er­ties with their spouses.</p>
    <p>“As Sirs was in­tended to sup­port (self-em­ployed per­sons), per­sons who were pre­vi­ously un­em­ployed or had reg­u­lar em­ploy­ment were redi­rected to the Covid-19 Sup­port Grant,” said Mrs Teo.</p>
    <p>“Where there were other ar­eas of need, we have re­ferred un­suc­cess­ful ap­pli­cants to the ap­pro­pri­ate agen­cies for fol­low-up as­sis­tance.”</p>
