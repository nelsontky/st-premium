    <p>StarHub’s net profit fell 5.6 per cent to $37.3 mil­lion for the sec­ond quar­ter ended June 30, from $39.5 mil­lion in the year-ago pe­riod.</p>
    <p>This came as most of the group’s re­tail stores were closed dur­ing Sin­ga­pore’s cir­cuit breaker pe­riod dur­ing the quar­ter, while its roam­ing, IDD and pre­paid mo­bile rev­enues also took a hit from the steep de­cline in travel as a re­sult of strict bor­der con­trols in­sti­tuted in late-March.</p>
    <p>The telco said in re­sults re­leased yes­ter­day that Q2 2020 was the first full fi­nan­cial quar­ter af­fected by the coro­n­avirus pan­demic.</p>
    <p>To­tal rev­enue sank 18 per cent to $453.4 mil­lion for the three months, from $552.8 mil­lion in the year-ago pe­riod pe­riod.</p>
    <p>Ser­vice rev­enue slumped 15 per cent to $376.2 mil­lion on lower con­tri­bu­tions from mo­bile, pay TV, broad­band and equip­ment sales.</p>
    <p>StarHub said in its out­look state­ment that busi­nesses are ex­pected to con­tinue in­vest­ing in their net­work in­fra­struc­ture as they adopt cloud ser­vices, which could help to mit­i­gate pric­ing ero­sion in tra­di­tional telco con­nec­tiv­ity ser­vice.</p>
    <p>Mr Char­lie Chan, head of en­ter­prise at StarHub, noted on an earn­ings call that the telco saw growth in the sec­ond quar­ter as the Covid-19 pan­demic led to more telecom­mut­ing.</p>
    <p>CEO Peter Kaliaropou­los said in a state­ment that “the chal­leng­ing en­vi­ron­ment and busi­ness con­di­tions will likely sus­tain through­out 2020”.</p>
    <p>For FY2020, the group is ex­pected to see a 10 per cent to 12 per cent de­cline in ser­vice rev­enue due to un­cer­tain­ties in con­sumer de­mand caused by Covid-19 mea­sures. All the same, the com­pany is up­beat on its plans for 5G de­vel­op­ment, with grow­ing in­ter­est in 5G solutions among the an­tic­i­pated driv­ers for its en­ter­prise busi­ness.</p>
    <p>StarHub and M1 have jointly clinched a li­cence for a na­tion­wide 5G net­work, with roll-out to start next year and each part­ner to in­di­vid­u­ally of­fer com­mer­cial ser­vices also from next year.</p>
    <p>StarHub – which ex­pects to make an ini­tial cap­i­tal in­vest­ment of $200 mil­lion, front-loaded in H2 2020 and 2021 – said that it is ta­per­ing off its capex on legacy net­works to the min­i­mum re­quired for reg­u­la­tory obli­ga­tions.</p>
    <p>The capex savings will be redi­rected to­wards the 5G net­work, while more in­vest­ments may also be made based on busi­ness de­mand.</p>
    <p>For the first half of this year, net profit de­clined 17.2 per cent to $77.4 mil­lion, and to­tal rev­enue dropped 16.5 per cent to $959.6 mil­lion. Ser­vice rev­enue for the six months was down 11.9 per cent to $781.1 mil­lion.</p>
    <p>StarHub shares closed down one cent or 0.8 per cent at $1.21 yes­ter­day.</p>
