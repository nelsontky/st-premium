    <p>Barcelona for­ward Luis Suarez (right), the third-high­est scorer in the Cata­lan side’s his­tory with 198 goals, was re­port­edly told he can start look­ing for an­other club by new coach Ron­ald Koe­man in a con­ver­sa­tion last­ing just 60 sec­onds.</p>
    <p>BARCELONA • Barcelona for­ward Luis Suarez looks to be on his way out of the Nou Camp af­ter lo­cal ra­dio sta­tion RAC1 re­ported that new coach Ron­ald Koe­man has told the Uruguayan in­ter­na­tional that he does not form part of his plans for the com­ing sea­son.</p>
    <p>The ra­dio sta­tion, which has very close links to the Span­ish La Liga side, said on Monday that the Dutch­man called the third-high­est scorer in the club’s his­tory (198 goals) and gave him the news in a 60-sec­ond con­ver­sa­tion.</p>
    <p>The player’s con­tract at the Nou Camp is due to ex­pire next June, and his lawyers will pre­sum­ably speak to the club to try to re­scind that deal to al­low him to be­come a free agent.</p>
    <p>Suarez, who has been at Barca since 2014, is not short of suit­ors, with for­mer club Ajax Am­s­ter­dam, Ma­jor League Soc­cer out­fit In­ter Mi­ami – who are owned by David Beck­ham – and Qatari side Al-Arabi all said to be in­ter­ested.</p>
    <p>There is also spec­u­la­tion that he could re­unite with Neymar at Paris Saint-Germain. The Brazil­ian was part of Barcelona’s famed “MSN”, with the tri­dent, in­clud­ing cap­tain Lionel Messi scor­ing 364 goals in 450 games between 2014-17, be­fore Neymar left for the French cham­pi­ons in a world-record €222 mil­lion (S$259 mil­lion) deal.</p>
    <p>But Suarez is re­port­edly un­happy with the way he is be­ing turfed out of the club de­spite be­ing a suc­cess fol­low­ing his £75 mil­lion (S$134.8 mil­lion) move from Liver­pool. Cata­lan daily Sport yes­ter­day said the 33-year-old has re­luc­tantly ac­cepted the de­ci­sion and will not “kick up a stink”.</p>
    <p>The news comes af­ter Suarez spoke to Span­ish daily El Pais, in­sist­ing “no­body” had dis­cussed his fu­ture with him and claimed that it was a knee-jerk re­ac­tion to get rid of long-serv­ing play­ers.</p>
    <p>“Every­one looks at those who have spent the most time at the club. That’s nor­mal, but it’s also fool­ish,” he said on Sun­day.</p>
    <p>He was Barca’s sec­ond-high­est top scorer last sea­son with 16 goals</p>
    <p>LEFT SMART­ING</p>
    <p>Every­one looks at those who have spent the most time at the club. That’s nor­mal, but it’s also fool­ish. ’’</p>
    <p>LUIS SUAREZ, Barcelona’s 33-year-old striker, on the club’s knee-jerk re­ac­tion to get rid of long-serv­ing play­ers.</p>
    <p>in La Liga, nine be­hind Messi, de­spite an in­jury-hit cam­paign that saw him un­dergo knee surgery in Jan­uary. But fol­low­ing the Cata­lan gi­ants’ tro­phy­less term – their first in 12 years – and their heav­i­est de­feat in Europe, he is con­sid­ered sur­plus to re­quire­ments and Koe­man must get his £290,000-a-week salary off the wage bill if he is to re­vamp the team.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to lo­cal daily Mundo De­portivo, In­ter Mi­lan striker Lau­taro Martinez is their No. 1 tar­get to re­place Suarez.</p>
    <p>The 23-year-old Ar­gentina in­ter­na­tional, who net­ted 21 goals in all com­pe­ti­tions for the Serie A side last sea­son, will not come cheap, with In­ter re­port­edly slap­ping a €90 mil­lion price tag on him.</p>
    <p>Join­ing Suarez at the exit door are three other big-name high earn­ers, Sa­muel Umtiti, Ivan Rakitic and Ar­turo Vi­dal, re­ported Span­ish me­dia.</p>
    <p>At 32 and 33 re­spec­tively, Croa­tia’s Rakitic and Chilean Vi­dal had been ex­pected to make way for new blood – al­though the mid­field duo played al­most the full La Liga term.</p>
    <p>Umtiti is much younger at 26, but he has had two in­jury-rav­aged sea­sons, fea­tur­ing just 27 times in the top flight, and Barca want to cut their losses on the France de­fender.</p>
    <p>Span­ish de­fender Jordi Alba’s fu­ture, how­ever, looks more se­cure af­ter RAC1 re­vealed that Koe­man told the 31-year-old that he wanted him in next sea­son’s squad.</p>
    <p>Com­pa­tri­ots Ser­gio Bus­quets, 32, and Ger­ard Pique, 33, also seem to be safe from the cull, while Philippe Coutinho – the fourth-most ex­pen­sive player of all time at €120 mil­lion – will be given an­other shot at res­ur­rect­ing his ca­reer at Barca af­ter spend­ing a year on loan at Euro­pean cham­pi­ons Bay­ern Mu­nich.</p>
    <p>The fu­ture of Messi, who has not made a public state­ment about his fu­ture amid ru­mours that he wants out with a year left on his deal, re­mains un­clear, es­pe­cially with his good friend Suarez set to leave.</p>
    <p>On Monday, Koe­man spelled out his phi­los­o­phy for Barca, telling the club’s TV chan­nel he planned to take in­spi­ra­tion – just like his fired pre­de­ces­sor Quique Se­tien – from for­mer coach Jo­han Cruyff.</p>
    <p>The for­mer Everton boss played un­der the leg­endary Dutch­man for six years un­til 1995, a tro­phy-laden pe­riod that saw Barca earn their first Euro­pean Cup.</p>
    <p>On the Cruyff-led “Dream Team”, Koe­man said: “I didn’t only learn to be a bet­ter player but a bet­ter coach too (un­der him). We had the best com­bi­na­tion. We played at­tack­ing foot­ball and won ti­tles. That is al­ways the phi­los­o­phy we have pur­sued at Barca.”</p>
    <p>For­mer Nether­lands striker Roy Makaay has also backed his coun­try­man’s re­vamp, telling Ra­dio Marca yes­ter­day that “Barca need new play­ers” and as­sur­ing the fans he is “a coach who likes to play beau­ti­fully, but who also wants to win”.</p>
