    <p>One of the ways that Bri­tish writer Zadie Smith has been deal­ing with the un­bear­able present is es­cap­ing to the past – by means of the his­tor­i­cal novel she is writ­ing.</p>
    <p>“It’s set in the 1800s and I must say I pre­fer spend­ing ev­ery day in the 1800s to a minute of 2020,” she says.</p>
    <p>Smith, 45, who wrote best-selling nov­els such as White Teeth (2000) and Or­ange Prize for Fic­tion win­ner On Beauty (2005), is one of the record 10 in­ter­na­tional head­lin­ers at the Sin­ga­pore Writ­ers Fes­ti­val, which runs from Fri­day to Nov 8 in its first fully dig­i­tal edi­tion.</p>
    <p>The theme of the fes­ti­val is in­ti­macy, which Smith con­sid­ers “the only con­so­la­tion in ex­is­tence – other peo­ple and their re­la­tion to you”.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing the Covid-19 pan­demic, she pub­lished In­ti­ma­tions, a col­lec­tion of six es­says that were writ­ten dur­ing the early months she spent un­der lock­down.</p>
    <p>In them, she de­scribes racism in the lan­guage of viruses and vac­cines; de­bates rel­a­tive priv­i­lege and whether one should com­pare the depth of their suf­fer­ing to that of oth­ers; and re­flects on what it means to cre­ate art in a pan­demic.</p>
    <p>She do­nated her roy­al­ties from the book to char­i­ties such as The Equal Jus­tice Ini­tia­tive and The Covid-19 Emer­gency Relief Fund for New York.</p>
    <p>“I ur­gently wanted to feel use­ful,” says Smith, a tenured pro­fes­sor of cre­ative writ­ing at New York Univer­sity, in an e-mail in­ter­view.</p>
    <p>“As writ­ing is my only skill, the idea of cre­at­ing a book and redi­rect­ing the funds was what I came up with.”</p>
    <p>In her fore­word for In­ti­ma­tions, she de­scribes how early on in the pan­demic, she read Med­i­ta­tions by Ro­man em­peror and philoso­pher Mar­cus Aure­lius, “not as an aca­demic ex­er­cise, nor in pur­suit of plea­sure, but with the same at­ti­tude I bring to the in­struc­tions for a flat-pack ta­ble”.</p>
    <p>She tells The Straits Times: “For me, as a reader, what I am al­ways in des­per­ate need of right now is an es­cape from jour­nal­ism, from its logic, its lan­guage, its em­phases, its col­lec­tivised ideas, its fre­quent ba­nal­ity and its am­bi­ent same­ness.</p>
    <p>“I need to know that lan­guage is not just this de­based thing used as a con­duit for ‘news’. I need to be able to re­mem­ber that it is the great­est hu­man gift and that it can be used, pre­cisely, for the pur­poses of con­nec­tion, com­pre­hen­sion and in­ti­macy.</p>
    <p>“Any writer who re­minds me of this ca­pac­ity of lan­guage saves my life right now.”</p>
    <p>What she gained from lock­down was an un­der­stand­ing of how much she needs other peo­ple, she says.</p>
    <p>What did it make her miss most?</p>
    <p>I need to know that lan­guage is not just this de­based thing used as a con­duit for ‘news’. I need to be able to re­mem­ber that it is the great­est hu­man gift and that it can be used, pre­cisely, for the pur­poses of con­nec­tion, com­pre­hen­sion and in­ti­macy.</p>
    <p>Any writer who re­minds me of this ca­pac­ity of lan­guage saves my life right now.</p>
    <p>“Mar­ti­nis.”</p>
    <p>Be­sides her five nov­els, Smith is also a pro­lific writer of es­says and short fic­tion – in 2018, she pub­lished es­say col­lec­tion Feel Free, fol­lowed last year by her first short story col­lec­tion, Grand Union.</p>
    <p>Yet, she says, she gets only three hours a day to write, “squeezed around do­mes­tic stuff, a half-hour ex­er­cise, an­swer­ing e-mails, do­ing univer­sity work and pick­ing up my kids from school”. She is mar­ried to North­ern Ir­ish poet and nov­el­ist Nick Laird, and they have two chil­dren, aged 11 and seven.</p>
    <p>“All I can tell you is ev­ery­thing I’ve ever writ­ten since 2009 has been writ­ten in those three hours, never at night and never on a week­end. I guess it goes to show what you can do with three hours a day if you’re re­ally des­per­ate.”</p>
    <p>Born to a Ja­maican mother and an English fa­ther, Smith grew up in a coun­cil hous­ing es­tate in north­west Lon­don.</p>
    <p>Char­ac­ters of mixed race of­ten fea­ture in her fic­tion, from the Belsey fam­ily in On Beauty – the fa­ther, Howard, is a white aca­demic and his wife, Kiki, is AfricanAme­r­i­can – to the bira­cial best friends of her 2016 novel Swing Time, who grow up in a hous­ing es­tate and bond over a love of dance.</p>
    <p>“I’m sure it is the very rea­son I am a writer,” Smith says of grow­ing up in be­tween iden­ti­ties and la­bels. “Be­ing un­clas­si­fi­able – in the eyes of oth­ers, not to my­self – was my ear­li­est ex­pe­ri­ence of the world.</p>
    <p>“I have al­ways had a sub­jec­tiv­ity that is heav­ily in­flu­enced by ob­jec­tiv­ity – hav­ing been an ob­ject of cu­rios­ity to oth­ers, I got in the habit of also look­ing at my­self from a dis­tance. It has been a use­ful habit when it comes to writ­ing.”</p>
    <p>As a child, she was a tap dancer, like the girls of Swing Time. While study­ing at the Univer­sity of Cam­bridge, she worked as a cabaret singer.</p>
    <p>Had she not forged a lit­er­ary ca­reer, start­ing with the sale of the par­tial manuscript of White Teeth while she was still at Cam­bridge, she would have liked to be a Broad­way star. “That was my ear­li­est dream,” she says.</p>
    <p>Her novel Swing Time takes its ti­tle from the 1936 mu­si­cal film of the same name, but the no­tion of “swing time” – be­ing re­moved from time or hav­ing time taken from one – takes on new mean­ing in 2020, a year de­fined by the dis­rup­tion of Covid-19 and the rise of the Black Lives Mat­ter move­ment.</p>
    <p>“I think any parox­ysm in Amer­ica al­ways swings time,” says Smith.</p>
    <p>“You’re al­ways aware of hav­ing been here be­fore. Amer­i­can his­tory is a series of vi­o­lent rep­e­ti­tions, out of which in­cre­men­tal progress comes. They do it the hard way, al­ways.”</p>
    <p>She adds: “I as­sume when peo­ple are fight­ing for jus­tice, one of the things they are fight­ing for is the space in which to live out their in­ti­mate lives and be con­cerned with their own part­ners, chil­dren, lovers and friends, rather than re­fresh­ing a Web page 50 times a day to find out what’s go­ing on with a bloated or­ange Neo-fas­cist.</p>
    <p>“It’s not that we ar­ti­fi­cially sep­a­rate the po­lit­i­cal and the in­ti­mate, but when pol­i­tics is in bal­ance and sane, it rightly oc­cu­pies a far smaller part of our daily men­tal land­scape.”</p>
