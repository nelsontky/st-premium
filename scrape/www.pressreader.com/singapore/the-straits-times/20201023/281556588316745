    <p>Real Madrid coach Zine­dine Zi­dane (right) was not happy after pro­moted Cadiz shocked the La Liga gi­ants 1-0 last Satur­day and he is now re­ally wor­ried after un­her­alded Ukrainian team Shakhtar pulled off a stun­ning 3-2 win on Wed­nes­day in the Cham­pi­ons League. They need a quick re­bound but it will not get eas­ier as Barcelona are next up in to­mor­row’s Cla­sico.</p>
    <p>MADRID • Shakhtar Donetsk had trav­elled to Real Madrid with­out 10 first-team play­ers and nine of their back­room staff due to a clus­ter of coro­n­avirus in­fec­tions at the club.</p>
    <p>Yet they some­how man­aged to pull off a 3-2 win on Wed­nes­day – their first vic­tory over the La Liga gi­ants and the first recorded by a Ukrainian side since Dy­namo Kiev 21 years ago – leav­ing Real coach Zine­dine Zi­dane a wor­ried man.</p>
    <p>The visi­tors blew the 13-time Euro­pean cham­pi­ons away in the first half, tak­ing a 3-0 lead and miss­ing chances to add to the score­line.</p>
    <p>While Real re­sponded with goals from Luka Mo­dric and Vini­cius Jr after the break and had a last-gasp goal ruled out for off­side, Zi­dane could not hide from the fact the Span­ish ti­tle hold­ers had been out­played by de­pleted op­po­nents.</p>
    <p>Real have lost their third straight game in the Cham­pi­ons League – their worst run since 1986. They have also been de­feated in seven out of eight games when cap­tain Ser­gio Ramos has not fea­tured.</p>
    <p>The Spain de­fender was left out of Zi­dane’s team over fit­ness con­cerns and his lead­er­ship was sorely miss­ing at the Al­fredo di Stefano Sta­dium. The French­man re­fused to use his ab­sence as an ex­cuse, shoul­der­ing the blame for his side’s slump in form.</p>
    <p>“We were lack­ing a bit of ev­ery­thing today but worst of all we were lack­ing con­fi­dence,” said Zi­dane, who was an hour late for his post­match press con­fer­ence.</p>
    <p>“It’s dif­fi­cult to think of what to say when you con­cede three goals in the first half. We made a mis­take with their first goal and from then on, it was very dif­fi­cult.</p>
    <p>“I’m left with a very bad feel­ing be­cause of ev­ery­thing that hap­pened tonight. It’s a bad game, a bad night but I’m the coach and I’m the one who has to find so­lu­tions. I didn’t find them tonight and it’s a very dif­fi­cult mo­ment for the play­ers.”</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to Span­ish me­dia re­ports, Zi­dane was late as he gave his stars a dress­ing-down and Mo­dric con­firmed his out­burst, say­ing: “We lacked con­fi­dence.</p>
    <p>“We were not at the level re­quired for this com­pe­ti­tion. The man­ager has said to us that we have to press more ef­fec­tively. We have to im­prove. We have to be united now. The next game will come quickly and we have to play bet­ter.”</p>
    <p>That game is the Cla­sico at Barcelona to­mor­row.</p>
    <p>Los­ing one game at Madrid rep­re­sents a cri­sis, let alone suc­ces­sive games, and a Nou Camp de­feat on the heels of up­sets by Cadiz in La Liga and Shakhtar will prompt spec­u­la­tion over Zi­dane’s po­si­tion.</p>
    <p>Span­ish me­dia out­lets are al­ready sharp­en­ing their knives, with Madrid-based Marca claim­ing Real are in “free fall”, writ­ing: “Ev­ery day, it’s worse... and Satur­day, it’s Barcelona.”</p>
    <p>Zi­dane, who has won 11 tro­phies as Real coach, knows he can hush his crit­ics by win­ning at their fiercest ri­vals. But he will have to do so with­out the in­jured Eden Haz­ard, while Ramos re­mains doubt­ful.</p>
    <p>“I have noth­ing to say, we’re go­ing to turn up there on Satur­day and we’re go­ing to be pre­pared. This is a neg­a­tive night for us but we have to change things,” he said.</p>
    <p>“I feel aw­ful for the play­ers, who have won so many things for me and don’t de­serve this. But this is foot­ball, one day, ev­ery­thing is grey and the next, the sun comes out. Some­times, it’s very dif­fi­cult and tonight is one of those times.”</p>
