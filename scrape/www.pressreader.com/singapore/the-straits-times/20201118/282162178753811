    <p>Sin­ga­pore Air­lines (SIA) has up­sized its multi-cur­rency medi­umterm note pro­gramme limit to $10 bil­lion, up from $5 bil­lion pre­vi­ously, the flag car­rier said in a bourse fil­ing yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Net pro­ceeds from the is­suance of notes un­der this pro­gramme will be used for gen­eral cor­po­rate or work­ing cap­i­tal pur­poses, or other such pur­pose as may be spec­i­fied in the rel­e­vant pric­ing sup­ple­ment, SIA noted.</p>
    <p>DBS and Cit­i­group Global Mar­kets Sin­ga­pore are the ar­rangers of the pro­gramme.</p>
    <p>SIA’s lat­est an­nounce­ment comes shortly af­ter the air­line last week said its new $850 mil­lion five-year con­vert­ible bonds have been up­sized amid strong in­vestor in­ter­est, and will carry a 1.625 per cent coupon.</p>
    <p>The of­fer­ing was four times over­sub­scribed by in­sti­tu­tional and other in­vestors, which en­abled the car­rier to up­size the deal from an ini­tial $750 mil­lion and with more at­trac­tive terms for SIA, the air­line said in a state­ment last Fri­day.</p>
    <p>HSBC was the sole bookrun­ner and lead man­ager of the sale.</p>
    <p>Since the start of FY2020/2021, in­clud­ing the lat­est is­suance, the air­line has raised about $12.2 bil­lion in to­tal.</p>
    <p>That in­cludes $8.8 bil­lion from its rights is­sue ear­lier this year, $2 bil­lion from se­cured fi­nanc­ing and more than $500 mil­lion through new com­mit­ted lines of credit and a short-term un­se­cured loan.</p>
    <p>It also re­tains the op­tion of rais­ing up to another $6.2 bil­lion in ad­di­tional manda­tory con­vert­ible bonds, which it can ex­er­cise by July 2021.</p>
    <p>Sep­a­rately, The Busi­ness Times wrote on Tues­day that SIA’s Covid­cov­ered add-on travel in­sur­ance for Sin­ga­pore-Hong Kong flights may draw air travel bub­ble trav­ellers.</p>
    <p>For one-way trips, the only ben­e­fit avail­able is travel can­cel­la­tion and post­pone­ment, ac­cord­ing to the web­site of AIG, which un­der­writes the in­sur­ance.</p>
    <p>As for a round trip de­part­ing from Sin­ga­pore, the add-on cov­er­age can in­clude emer­gency evac­u­a­tion and repa­tri­a­tion costs if the in­sured is di­ag­nosed over­seas.</p>
    <p>SIA shares closed 4.91 per cent higher at $4.06 yes­ter­day.</p>
