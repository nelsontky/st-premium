    <p>Chan, 37, a ro­botic ap­pli­ca­tion engi­neer and co-founder of Bot­sCom, which was started two years ago.</p>
    <p>He be­lieves a ro­bot’s built-in safety mech­a­nisms and safe pro­gram­ming are a per­fect fit for hu­man col­lab­o­ra­tion. “The ro­bot has an ac­cu­racy of 0.1mm and those with lim­ited mo­bil­ity or other dis­abil­i­ties are able to as­sist it in car­ry­ing out com­plex and even del­i­cate work,” says Mr Chan, who has more than 10 years of ex­pe­ri­ence in fac­tory process au­to­ma­tion and lin­ear robotics.</p>
    <p>What will the start-up dream up next?</p>
    <p>“Brid­get the Break­fast Brunch Maker,” says Mr Chan, on Bot­sCom’s new ro­botic full­break­fast maker, which is synced with other au­to­ma­tion in­put to pro­duce a com­plete break­fast with eggs, sausages and hash browns.</p>
    <p>“We are also de­vel­op­ing bar­tender robots which can move around like a hu­man bar­tender.”</p>
    <p>While most tech com­pa­nies may draw in­spi­ra­tion from a down-toearth muse, oth­ers are driven by more fu­tur­is­tic as­pi­ra­tions.</p>
    <p>Lo­cal lift parts com­pany First Step El­e­va­tor has re­leased a new lift but­ton panel that is a holo­gram.</p>
    <p>Its Holo­graphic But­ton Mod­ule hov­ers in mid-air – rem­i­nis­cent of a scene straight out of Ge­orge Lu­cas’ Star Wars – and is con­tact­less. It works with a com­bi­na­tion of holo­graphic tech­nol­ogy and light sen­sors us­ing an An­droid-based soft­ware to de­tect the lo­ca­tion of the user’s fin­ger­tip.</p>
    <p>The sys­tem has been on trial at Maple­tree In­dus­trial, lo­cated at New Hi-Tech Space@30A Kal­lang Place since Aug 1.</p>
    <p>The mod­ule has piqued the in­ter­est of other prop­erty own­ers ex­plor­ing ways to en­hance the touch-free ex­pe­ri­ence in their own prop­er­ties, says com­pany di­rec­tor Alan Tang, 39.</p>
    <p>It is set up con­ve­niently for both stand­ing users as well as those in wheel­chairs and elim­i­nates hy­giene-re­lated is­sues, which are es­pe­cially rel­e­vant given the cur­rent coron­avirus pan­demic. It costs be­tween $6,000 and $9,000 to in­stall, de­pend­ing on the num­ber of floors in the build­ing.</p>
    <p>While it is clear de­sign can el­e­vate the hu­man con­di­tion in more ways than one, can it also be fun for those with dis­abil­i­ties?</p>
    <p>Dan­ish toy pro­duc­tion com­pany the Lego Group cer­tainly thinks so. The Lego Foun­da­tion and the Lego Group launched a pi­lot of Braille Lego last year.</p>
    <p>Be­gin­ning this month, the new Lego Braille Bricks will be avail­able in seven coun­tries, fol­lowed by an­other 13 coun­tries early next year. While Sin­ga­pore is not on the list, there are plans to in­tro­duce the con­cept to more coun­tries in the fu­ture.</p>
    <p>Each brick in the Lego Braille Bricks tool­kit has studs ar­ranged to cor­re­spond to num­bers and let­ters in the Braille al­pha­bet. The bricks also show the printed ver­sion of the sym­bol or let­ter, al­low­ing both sighted and blind chil­dren to play and learn to­gether.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to Ms Stine Storm, Lego Foun­da­tion’s senior play and health spe­cial­ist, the bricks’ de­sign was driven by the need to cre­ate play ex­pe­ri­ences which en­able cre­ative learn­ing for all chil­dren.</p>
    <p>“Blind and vis­ually dis­abled chil­dren have the same de­sire and need to ex­plore the world as well as so­cialise through play,” says Ms Storm.</p>
    <p>“We hope to em­power the com­mu­nity to push the bound­aries of their imag­i­na­tions while spark­ing an in­ter­est in learn­ing Braille among chil­dren, to pro­vide them the im­por­tant sup­port needed to be­come con­fi­dent and in­de­pen­dent nav­i­ga­tors of the world we live in.”</p>
