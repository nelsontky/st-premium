    <p>Sov­er­eign wealth fund GIC will in­te­grate cli­mate change into its in­vest­ment port­fo­lio, a re­port said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>This will in­volve eval­u­at­ing the way long-term cap­i­tal mar­ket as­sump­tions are af­fected by cli­mate change driv­ers and un­der dif­fer­ent cli­mate change sce­nar­ios.</p>
    <p>GIC is also en­sur­ing that its in­vest­ment teams in­te­grate cli­mate change con­sid­er­a­tions into their pro­cesses. An­a­lysts tap en­vi­ron­men­tal met­rics to iden­tify risks and con­duct fur­ther due dili­gence and en­gage­ment with com­pa­nies.</p>
    <p>Ms Rachel Teo, who heads the fu­tures (re­search) unit and is senior vice-pres­i­dent for eco­nom­ics and in­vest­ment strat­egy, said in the re­port that GIC will not just bluntly di­vest from firms with high car­bon in­ten­sity.</p>
    <p>“We would in­stead seek to en­gage and un­der­stand if the com­pa­nies have plans to tran­sit to a lower car­bon busi­ness model, and will sup­port them in their tran­si­tion path to­wards long-term sus­tain­abil­ity,” she wrote.</p>
    <p>The fo­cus for GIC will also be in ar­eas such as re­new­able en­ergy, green build­ings, sus­tain­able food and agri­cul­ture, elec­tric mo­bil­ity and other emerg­ing tech­nolo­gies that will fa­cil­i­tate a de­car­bon­i­sa­tion of the global econ­omy.</p>
    <p>This strat­egy is be­ing re­flected else­where.</p>
    <p>Mr Bob Lit­ter­man, chair­man of the risk com­mit­tee at in­vest­ment ad­viser Ke­pos Cap­i­tal, said in a sep­a­rate re­port that in­vestors should be “highly con­cerned about the un­der­ly­ing pol­icy un­cer­tainty” with the re­al­ity of cli­mate change now ob­vi­ous.</p>
    <p>Yet, he said, in­vestors have not taken into ac­count the broader risks that ex­ist across their en­tire port­fo­lio.</p>
    <p>Mr Lit­ter­man said that all as­set classes and most eco­nomic sec­tors are ex­posed to the risk of a rapid tran­si­tion to a low-car­bon econ­omy.</p>
    <p>To be sure, fos­sil fuel com­pany val­u­a­tions are highly sen­si­tive to this risk. But there are many other com­pa­nies and in­dus­tries that will be im­pacted and whose busi­ness mod­els or as­sets are also at risk of be­ing stranded, he added.</p>
    <p>Mr Lit­ter­man said that there are “strong op­por­tu­ni­ties to gen­er­ate ad­di­tional re­turns” as the tran­si­tion to­wards a net-zero emis­sions econ­omy will also cre­ate new tech­nolo­gies and busi­ness mod­els.</p>
    <p>“In fact, I sus­pect that tran­si­tion­ing to a net-zero econ­omy, adapt­ing to the new cli­mate re­al­ity while build­ing a sus­tain­able econ­omy, and si­mul­ta­ne­ously suck­ing car­bon diox­ide out of the at­mos­phere at the re­quired scale will be the in­vest­ing themes of the next sev­eral decades.”</p>
