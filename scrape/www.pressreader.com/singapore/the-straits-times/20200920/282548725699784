    <p>March 21 - April 19</p>
    <p>You have to re­new your com­mit­ment to a per­son or project – maybe for­mally, or maybe just inside your heart. You may find it much eas­ier than you had an­tic­i­pated.</p>
    <p>April 20 - May 20</p>
    <p>Your fa­mous moods have taken over, which could mean your peo­ple are get­ting ner­vous. You do not need to re­as­sure them – they should know by now that this does not last long.</p>
    <p>May 21 - June 20</p>
    <p>Your brain picks up on some sub­tle sig­nals com­ing your way, so make sure you are ready for them. It is a good time to just re­ceive in­for­ma­tion, as you can act on it later.</p>
    <p>June 21 - July 22</p>
    <p>You are not feel­ing that de­ci­sive, which could cause some prob­lems with a friend or col­league. What he or she does not know is that you have good rea­sons to de­fer this big choice.</p>
    <p>July 23 - Aug 22</p>
    <p>Your fam­ily is im­por­tant to you and today brings you the op­por­tu­nity to give some­thing back to them. It may be small or sur­pris­ing, but it is sure to lift them in a good way.</p>
    <p>Aug 23 - Sept 22</p>
    <p>Your emo­tional side is driv­ing you a lit­tle crazy, so see if you can rein it in by tack­ling is­sues that are strictly in­tel­lec­tual. That may not work, so be pre­pared for a bumpy ride.</p>
    <p>Sept 23 - Oct 22</p>
    <p>Your pos­ses­sions may be drag­ging you down – clean­ing, re­pair­ing and other costs may be all it takes for you to dream about giv­ing it all away. Try a yard sale. Your busi­ness savvy is peak­ing.</p>
    <p>Oct 23 - Nov 21</p>
    <p>Your cre­ative vi­sion is clear now, so make sure you are up to man­i­fest­ing what­ever it is you are dream­ing up. Your en­ergy is strong, which means that al­most any­thing should be pos­si­ble.</p>
    <p>Nov 22 - Dec 21</p>
    <p>You are feel­ing pretty shy and there is noth­ing wrong with that. You may just want to tell your friends you need to be alone, or you need to shut your­self off for a while.</p>
    <p>Dec 22 - Jan 19</p>
    <p>Check out the de­tails – you need to dive deeply and see what you can learn. Facts are facts, which could mean you have to live with re­sults that you do not agree with in your gut.</p>
    <p>Jan 20 - Feb 18</p>
    <p>You feel like a per­form­ing mon­key. Can you have fun with it? If not, just put on your show and then get off stage as quickly as you can. This phase should not last very long.</p>
    <p>Feb 19 - March 20</p>
    <p>Work is tough today– your en­ergy is a lit­tle out of sync with that of your clients or col­leagues, which could mean that you are talking past each other. Do not take it too se­ri­ously.</p>
