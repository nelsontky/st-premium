    <p>Marco Zanini’s claim to fame was res­ur­rect­ing the dusty Rochas brand in 2009 after Olivier Theyskens’ de­par­ture in 2006 left the la­bel adrift and drowned out by big­ger com­peti­tors.</p>
    <p>Stay­ing on for five years, the Ital­ian de­signer led Rochas from strength to strength be­fore he was poached by Diego Della Valle of Tod’s Group to head the re­vival of the long-dor­mant Schi­a­par­elli name.</p>
    <p>His vi­sion for the iconic Parisian house was de­light­fully mad­cap and ut­terly glam­orous, but Zanini found him­self let go after only a year.</p>
    <p>“It be­came in­creas­ingly dif­fi­cult to work with big brands and I re­alised it didn’t rep­re­sent a cre­ative chal­lenge any­more. We were all ex­pe­ri­enc­ing this fash­ion fa­tigue. Every­thing feels so cor­po­rate,” Zanini said to Dana Thomas of The New York Times in Septem­ber last year.</p>
    <p>Zanini stayed away from the in­dus­try un­til early last year, when he heeded the call of fash­ion once more.</p>
    <p>With the launch of Zanini Col­lec­tion, he was de­ter­mined to do things dif­fer­ently.</p>
    <p>For one thing, the land­scape is now vastly al­tered – ev­ery­one has seen the harm­ful­ness of the ex­cess and dis­pos­abil­ity that run ram­pant through fash­ion to­day.</p>
    <p>His re­sponse is to place thought­ful­ness at the heart of his new brand, de­lib­er­ately keep­ing ev­ery as­pect small and highly per­sonal.</p>
    <p>Zanini Col­lec­tion is prac­ti­cally a one-man show.</p>
    <p>For his de­but Fall/Win­ter 2019 col­lec­tion, he shot the look­book, pre­sented the col­lec­tion in his own Mi­lan apart­ment, in­vited buy­ers and fielded or­ders all by him­self. In the spirit of keep­ing things small, the de­signer will be re­leas­ing only two col­lec­tions a year, with each clock­ing in at less than 30 looks.</p>
    <p>The pieces them­selves are made in limited quan­ti­ties, to pre­serve a sense of spe­cial­ness, but also be­cause the de­signer works with fabrics pro­duced in small-batch runs.</p>
    <p>In­stead of trendy, throw­away pieces, Zanini de­signs with an eye to­wards time­less­ness, re­sult­ing in pieces that feel like mod­ern heir­looms – pre­cious things to love, keep and pass down.</p>
    <p>He achieves this with his uniquely ro­man­tic yet con­tem­po­rary take on his­tori­cism – a poet sleeve ref­er­enc­ing 17th-cen­tury dresses, jet bead­ing that nods to the flap­per era, duchess satin that evokes mid-cen­tury cou­ture and lus­trous ki­mono silks that bring to mind 1940s boudoir dress­ing.</p>
    <p>Tai­lor­ing has also emerged as a strong suit. His stands out for its pow­er­ful pro­por­tions given hour­glass shapes via silk rib­bons that tie at the back.</p>
    <p>Fur­ther­ing the aura of ex­clu­siv­ity, Zanini is keep­ing dis­tri­bu­tion tight. For now, he is by­pass­ing e-com­merce, pre­fer­ring the clothes be dis­cov­ered in stores and for clients to fall in love with the way they feel.</p>
    <p>He is also part­ner­ing only 10 re­tail­ers world­wide, which in­clude es­teemed names such as Dover Street Mar­ket, Club 21 and Ikram – a con­vinc­ing ar­gu­ment for think­ing small but aim­ing high.</p>
