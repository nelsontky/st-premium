    <p>WASH­ING­TON • Ama­zon on Tues­day un­veiled a new bio­met­ric pay­ment sys­tem us­ing palm recog­ni­tion to be made avail­able to ri­val re­tail­ers and also pro­moted as a re­place­ment for badge en­try at sta­di­ums or work­places.</p>
    <p>The sys­tem called Ama­zon One was touted as “a fast, con­ve­nient, con­tact­less way for peo­ple to use their palm to make ev­ery­day ac­tiv­i­ties like pay­ing at a store, pre­sent­ing a loy­alty card, en­ter­ing a lo­ca­tion like a sta­dium, or badg­ing into work more ef­fort­less”.</p>
    <p>The US tech­nol­ogy gi­ant said it would be in­stalling the sys­tem at its Ama­zon Go re­tail lo­ca­tions, start­ing with two stores in its home­town of Seat­tle, Wash­ing­ton.</p>
    <p>Ama­zon vice-pres­i­dent Dilip Ku­mar said the sys­tem was de­vel­oped as “a quick, re­li­able, and se­cure way for peo­ple to iden­tify them­selves or au­tho­rise a trans­ac­tion while mov­ing seam­lessly through their day”.</p>
    <p>Ama­zon One uses each in­di­vid­ual’s “unique palm sig­na­ture”, an alternativ­e to other bio­met­ric iden­ti­fiers such as fin­ger­print, iris or fa­cial recog­ni­tion.</p>
    <p>“No two palms are alike, so we an­a­lyse all th­ese as­pects with our vi­sion tech­nol­ogy and se­lect the most dis­tinct iden­ti­fiers on your palm to cre­ate your palm sig­na­ture,” Mr Ku­mar said in a blog post.</p>
    <p>In Ama­zon Go stores, the palmwav­ing sys­tem will be added to the en­try gate as an op­tion for shop­pers.</p>
    <p>Mr Ku­mar said: “In most re­tail en­vi­ron­ments, Ama­zon One could be­come an al­ter­nate pay­ment or loy­alty card op­tion with a de­vice at the check­out counter next to a tra­di­tional point of sale sys­tem.”</p>
    <p>The com­pany said it was “in ac­tive dis­cus­sions with sev­eral po­ten­tial cus­tomers” that could in­clude other re­tail­ers, but of­fered no de­tails.</p>
    <p>The an­nounce­ment comes amid rapid growth in the use of bio­met­ric pay­ments rang­ing from fin­ger­print ver­i­fi­ca­tion on smart­phones to more so­phis­ti­cated sys­tems us­ing fa­cial recog­ni­tion.</p>
    <p>China’s Ali­pay – the fi­nan­cial arm of -ecom­merce gi­ant Alibaba – has been us­ing a “Smile-to-Pay” sys­tem, with a ma­chine roughly the size of an iPad, for re­tail­ers.</p>
    <p>Mr Doug Stephens of the con­sult­ing firm Re­tail Prophet said Ama­zon would need to pro­tect the data to gain user trust in the sys­tem to make it main­stream.</p>
    <p>“Bio­met­rics as a form of ID/pay­ment etc has al­ways made ul­ti­mate sense,” Mr Stephens said on Twit­ter. “The ques­tion is, will Ama­zon main­stream our com­fort with them or vi­o­late our trust?”</p>
