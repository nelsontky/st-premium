    <p>MARK LEE UN­DER QUAR­AN­TINE IN TAI­WAN:</p>
    <p>A friend in need is a friend in­deed.</p>
    <p>Home-grown co­me­dian Mark Lee (above) is un­der quar­an­tine at a ho­tel in Taipei ahead of the Golden Horse Awards on Nov 21.</p>
    <p>Lee, 52, is nom­i­nated for Best Lead­ing Ac­tor for the film Num­ber 1, in which he played a re­trenched civil en­gi­neer who ends up per­form­ing in a drag show.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to Chi­nese daily Lianhe Wan­bao,</p>
    <p>Lee trav­elled to Taipei on Sun­day with his wife Cather­ine Ng, di­rec­tor Ong Kuo Sin and scriptwrit­er-ac­tor Jaspers Lai. Their quar­an­tine should end by Nov 16.</p>
    <p>On Mon­day, Lee posted a photo of Tai­wanese co­me­dian Nono bring­ing him food and wrote: “Thanks to Nono for vis­it­ing me in prison. It is so spe­cial as I am on the sev­enth floor while he is on the first floor.”</p>
    <p>He added the hash­tags #this­broth­eris­good, #brother and #touched.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, Nono posted a photo of Lee look­ing down from the ho­tel room.</p>
    <p>The cap­tion was: “Wel­com­ing my brother from Sin­ga­pore. He is pre­par­ing to go on stage to re­ceive his award af­ter fly­ing to Taipei and serv­ing his quar­an­tine.”</p>
    <p>Nono also posted a photo of him­self with a box of pan­dan chif­fon cake and kueh lapis from Lee.</p>
    <p>Lee told the Chi­nese daily that he does his skin­care reg­i­men ev­ery night and is pre­par­ing his thank-you speech while un­der quar­an­tine.</p>
    <p>He said: “Af­ter all, I can’t cause Sin­ga­porean artists to lose face and need to say some­thing mean­ing­ful.”</p>
