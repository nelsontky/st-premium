    <p>SEOUL • The Bu­san In­ter­na­tional Film Fes­ti­val, Asia’s big­gest gath­er­ing of its kind, will be re­duced to a frac­tion of its usual scale with sev­eral sec­tions moved online be­cause of the coro­n­avirus pan­demic, or­gan­is­ers said on Mon­day.</p>
    <p>The event nor­mally sees a host of stars and i ndus­try fig­ures from across Asia and fur­ther afield, in­clud­ing peo­ple from Hol­ly­wood, de­scend on the South Korean port city for 10 days of crit­i­cal con­sid­er­a­tion and fi­nan­cial deal-mak­ing.</p>
    <p>But South Korea – which largely over­came an early coro­n­avirus surge with ex­ten­sive trac­ing and testing – has re­ported sev­eral clus­ters in re­cent weeks, rais­ing con­cerns of a sec­ond wave and prompt­ing the au­thor­i­ties to tighten so­cial dis­tanc­ing mea­sures last month.</p>
    <p>Those curbs are be­ing tem­po­rar­ily eased in the greater Seoul area, of­fi­cials an­nounced last weekend, but Bu­san or­gan­is­ers said they had no choice but to cut back on the fes­ti­val – which will also be de­layed by two weeks.</p>
    <p>“We ag­o­nised over whether we should go ahead with host­ing the event,” fes­ti­val chair­man Lee Yongk­wan told re­porters.</p>
    <p>And he hinted that it could still be can­celled al­to­gether if South Korea’s tra­di­tional Chuseok har­vest fes­ti­val trig­gers a new surge in in­fec­tions.</p>
    <p>“There could be a sit­u­a­tion in which we won’t be able to host the event,” he said.</p>
    <p>Orig­i­nally set for early next month, or­gan­is­ers said it will be pushed back to Oct 21 to 30 and gave de­tails of the cut-backs in a state­ment.</p>
    <p>“All out­door events are can­celled, in­clud­ing the open­ing and clos­ing cer­e­monies,” they said, “in or­der to pre­vent crowds from gath­er­ing”.</p>
    <p>“There will be no in­ter­na­tional in­vi­ta­tions, nor will there be any re­cep­tions or par­ties hosted to pro­vide net­work­ing op­por­tu­ni­ties for film in­dus­try pro­fes­sion­als.”</p>
    <p>A to­tal of 192 films from 68 coun­tries will be shown, but each movie will be screened only once, com­pared with two or three times last year.</p>
    <p>All judg­ing for the fes­ti­val’s pres­ti­gious awards will take place online, as will its film and project mar­kets, and dis­cus­sion fo­rum.</p>
    <p>The multi-di­rec­tor an­thol­ogy Septet: The Story Of Hong Kong, which pays trib­ute to the ter­ri­tory from the 1950s to the present day, will open the fes­ti­val.</p>
    <p>It is directed by seven fa­mous film-mak­ers from Hong Kong – John­nie To, Sammo Hung, Ann Hui, Pa­trick Tam, Yuen Wo Ping, Tsui Hark and the late Ringo Lam, who died at age 63 in De­cem­ber 2018.</p>
    <p>The clos­ing film will be Ja­panese di­rec­tor Ko­taro Ta­mura’s an­i­mated movie Josee, The Tiger And The Fish, cen­tred on a reclu­sive, dis­abled young woman.</p>
