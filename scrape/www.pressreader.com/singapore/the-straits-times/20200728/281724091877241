    <p>Assyakirin Mosque in Jurong West, Din Tai Fung at Northpoint City and Queensway Shop­ping Cen­tre were among places vis­ited by Covid-19 pa­tients while they were in­fec­tious, the Min­istry of Health (MOH) said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Sri Mu­ru­gan Vi­las restau­rant at 50 Clive Street, the FairPrice out­let and hawker cen­tre at Kam­pung Ad­mi­ralty and Ra­mada by Wyn­d­ham Sin­ga­pore at Zhong­shan Park were also newly added to the list of places vis­ited by those pa­tients.</p>
    <p>MOH pro­vides the list of lo­ca­tions and the times that in­fec­tious pa­tients have vis­ited for at least 30 min­utes, to get those who were at these places at spe­cific pe­ri­ods to mon­i­tor their health closely for two weeks from the date of their visit.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, a one-year-old baby boy was among 15 im­ported coro­n­avirus pa­tients an­nounced by MOH yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>This is the high­est in nearly four months since April 1, when there were 20 im­ported cases. This is also the first time since then that the fig­ure has hit dou­ble dig­its.</p>
    <p>The baby, an In­dian na­tional, was one of two de­pen­dant’s pass hold­ers who ar­rived from In­dia on July 12 and 14.</p>
    <p>Among the other 13 other im­ported pa­tients were two Sin­ga­pore­ans who re­turned to Sin­ga­pore from In­dia on July 15, and 11 work pass or work per­mit hold­ers who are em­ployed here and ar­rived in Sin­ga­pore from In­dia or the Philip­pines be­tween July 14 and 15.</p>
    <p>All the im­ported pa­tients tested pos­i­tive on Sun­day. They were placed on 14-day stay-home no­tice upon ar­rival in Sin­ga­pore and tested while serv­ing their no­tice, said MOH.</p>
    <p>The two com­mu­nity cases re­ported yes­ter­day com­prise a Sin­ga­porean and a work pass holder who were de­tected due to screen­ing of peo­ple work­ing at dor­mi­to­ries.</p>
    <p>Mi­grant work­ers re­sid­ing in dor­mi­to­ries made up the re­main­ing 452 of 469 cases an­nounced yes­ter­day, tak­ing Sin­ga­pore’s to­tal to 50,838.</p>
    <p>MOH also an­nounced a new clus­ter in a dor­mi­tory at 6 Sungei Kadut Street 2.</p>
    <p>The av­er­age num­ber of new daily cases in the com­mu­nity in a week has de­creased from 10 cases two weeks ago to five in the past week.</p>
    <p>The num­ber of un­linked cases in the com­mu­nity in a week has de­creased from a daily av­er­age of five cases to three over the same pe­riod.</p>
    <p>With 171 cases dis­charged yes­ter­day, 45,677 pa­tients have fully re­cov­ered from the dis­ease.</p>
    <p>A to­tal of 179 pa­tients re­main in hos­pi­tal, while 4,940 are re­cu­per­at­ing in com­mu­nity fa­cil­i­ties. None is in in­ten­sive care.</p>
