    <p>The global econ­omy may be go­ing through its worst re­ces­sion in a cen­tury, but Asia is well po­si­tioned to con­trib­ute to global growth, said Deputy Prime Min­is­ter Heng Swee Keat yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Not­ing that China is the sec­ond­largest econ­omy in the world, and that the 10 Asean economies grew around 5 per cent last year, Mr Heng said the out­look for Asia re­mains bright.</p>
    <p>Asia’s eco­nomic fun­da­men­tals are strong, too, hav­ing un­der­taken re­forms after the Asian and global fi­nan­cial crises, he added.</p>
    <p>“Many Asian economies have a large and grow­ing middle class, pro­vid­ing a strong base for pro­duc­tion and con­sump­tion. Asia is home to a vi­brant start-up ecosys­tem and to many in­no­va­tive com­pa­nies.”</p>
    <p>He fur­ther said that all coun­tries and busi­nesses will have to make ad­just­ments in a post-Covid-19 world, which is likely to place a big­ger pre­mium on sup­ply chain re­silience, dig­i­tal­i­sa­tion and in­no­va­tion, as well as new ar­eas of growth.</p>
    <p>Mr Heng, who is also the Fi­nance Min­is­ter, was giv­ing a key­note ad­dress at the Fu­tureChina Global Fo­rum, whose theme is A Re­silient Fu­ture: Post-Pan­demic Trans­for­ma­tion And Op­por­tu­ni­ties In China And Asean.</p>
    <p>The an­nual fo­rum brings to­gether gov­ern­ment and busi­ness lead­ers as well as lead­ing thinkers on a range of China-re­lated is­sues.</p>
    <p>The fo­rum, which ends to­mor­row, is held vir­tu­ally this year ow­ing to Covid-19.</p>
    <p>Mr Heng said there are three things coun­tries can do to con­trib­ute to the re­gion’s growth and build a more re­silient fu­ture.</p>
    <p>First, they need to stay open and con­nected to the world, while reforming their economies so that glob­al­i­sa­tion works for all.</p>
    <p>In this re­gard, Sin­ga­pore is re­view­ing its work pass poli­cies, strength­en­ing fair con­sid­er­a­tion, up­skilling work­ers and strength­en­ing so­cial safety nets for those af­fected by eco­nomic dis­rup­tion, he said.</p>
    <p>“But we must not un­der­mine what has made us suc­cess­ful by clos­ing our­selves off from the world...</p>
    <p>Many Asian economies have a large and grow­ing middle class, pro­vid­ing a strong base for pro­duc­tion and con­sump­tion. Asia is home to a vi­brant start-up ecosys­tem and to many in­no­va­tive com­pa­nies.</p>
    <p>DEPUTY PRIME MIN­IS­TER HENG SWEE KEAT</p>
    <p>“We must con­tinue to sig­nal our com­mit­ment to mul­ti­lat­er­al­ism, and to free and open trade.”</p>
    <p>China, too, he said, is con­tin­u­ing to re­form its econ­omy un­der a new eco­nomic model of “dual cir­cu­la­tion” – de­fined as “tak­ing the domestic mar­ket as the main­stay while let­ting in­ter­nal and external mar­kets boost each other”.</p>
    <p>Since its first men­tion in May at a meet­ing of the Polit­buro – China’s top de­ci­sion-mak­ing body – Chi­nese Pres­i­dent Xi Jin­ping has re­peat­edly talked about a new eco­nomic de­vel­op­ment strat­egy that re­lies less on global in­te­gra­tion and more on ex­pand­ing domestic com­merce.</p>
    <p>Mr Heng said that while China’s re­liance on its domestic mar­ket will grow, “in­ter­na­tional cir­cu­la­tion” will not di­min­ish in im­por­tance, and the two types of cir­cu­la­tion</p>
    <p>must re­in­force each other.</p>
    <p>Sec­ond, Sin­ga­pore has to strengthen its con­nec­tiv­ity with the re­gion and the world.</p>
    <p>It is fa­cil­i­tat­ing the move­ment of goods, data and peo­ple in var­i­ous ways, in­clud­ing work­ing with like­minded part­ners to keep trade lines and sup­ply chains open, hav­ing smart cities ini­tia­tives with Asean and China, plus open­ing its bor­ders for essen­tial busi­ness and of­fi­cial travel with China, Malaysia, Brunei, South Korea and Ja­pan, he added.</p>
    <p>Third, Sin­ga­pore must build part­ner­ships among busi­nesses.</p>
    <p>Ex­am­ples he cited in­clude the Emerg­ing Stronger Task­force, to find new bright spots in Sin­ga­pore and the re­gion; the in­dus­try-led Al­liances for Ac­tion, to pro­to­type new so­lu­tions quickly in ar­eas such as smart com­merce and sus­tain­abil­ity; and cross-bor­der col­lab­o­ra­tions in ar­eas like in­fra­struc­ture.</p>
    <p>To en­sure their ac­tiv­i­ties ben­e­fit the wider so­ci­ety, busi­nesses need to work with a wide range of stake­hold­ers, in­clud­ing work­ers and lo­cal com­mu­ni­ties, Mr Heng added.</p>
    <p>“In this way, we make eco­nomic growth in­clu­sive and sus­tain­able.”</p>
    <p>While this year marks 30 years of Sin­ga­pore-China diplo­matic ties and next year, 30 years of Asean-China di­a­logue, Mr Heng noted that the ties go back more than 1,000 years when there was al­ready a vi­brant trad­ing net­work be­tween China, South-east Asia and the world.</p>
    <p>“This trad­ing net­work and the bonds of our peo­ple have been re­silient, eb­bing and flow­ing over the last 10 cen­turies.”</p>
    <p>He noted that he re­ceived Mr Yang Jiechi, a Polit­buro mem­ber and head of the Chi­nese Com­mu­nist Party’s for­eign af­fairs of­fice, last month in Sin­ga­pore. “He was my first for­eign visi­tor since the Covid-19 out­break,” said Mr Heng.</p>
    <p>He looks for­ward to host­ing Chi­nese Vice-Pre­mier Han Zheng in Sin­ga­pore later this year when they co-chair the 16th Joint Coun­cil for Bi­lat­eral Co­op­er­a­tion, he added.</p>
    <p>Mr Heng stressed that while Covid-19 has added to the anx­i­eties of glob­al­i­sa­tion, Sin­ga­pore must stay open and con­nected to Asia and the world.</p>
    <p>“(We must) be­lieve in our abil­ity to adapt, evolve our ap­proaches and forge new part­ner­ships with one an­other. Only then, can we con­trib­ute to and ben­e­fit from Asia’s growth.”</p>
