    <p>Here are some ba­sic facts in the durian con­tro­versy in Pa­hang state.</p>
    <p>• A com­pany, Royal Pa­hang Durian (RPD), was given land rights for 60 years by the state gov­ern­ment to cul­ti­vate durian farms and build a durian pro­cess­ing fac­tory.</p>
    <p>• RPD’s big­gest share­hold­ers are the Pa­hang royal fam­ily. The com­pany has a joint ven­ture with the Pa­hang Agri­cul­ture Devel­op­ment Au­thor­ity to un­der­take durian cul­ti­va­tion in the dis­puted lands in Raub dis­trict.</p>
    <p>• Most of the land has been oc­cu­pied by durian farm­ers who have been there for the past 30 to 50 years. Farm­ers claim mul­ti­ple ap­pli­ca­tions to the state au­thor­i­ties for a land lease were re­jected, re­sult­ing in them op­er­at­ing with­out a li­cence for decades.</p>
    <p>• RPD has of­fered a le­gal­i­sa­tion scheme to farm­ers which binds them to pro­duce duri­ans and sell these to the com­pany at a fixed price. They also need to pay a rental fee for the land, mea­sured by acres.</p>
    <p>• Mu­sang King duri­ans have a fluc­tu­at­ing price as the pro­duce amount varies by cli­mate and weather.</p>
    <p>• RPD claims the fixed price still pro­vides a hand­some profit to farm­ers. This is dis­puted by farm­ers, who claim RPD has not taken into ac­count the off-sea­son costs of main­tain­ing durian trees.</p>
    <p>• Mu­sang King durian trees take five to seven years to ma­ture.</p>
    <p>• Sixty per cent of all Mu­sang King ex­ports from Malaysia orig­i­nate from these dis­puted lands in Raub.</p>
    <p>• The area is the birth­place of the cur­rent ver­sion of Mu­sang King in Malaysia.</p>
    <p>The name orig­i­nated from Raub in the late 1980s. The vil­lagers be­gan plant­ing Mu­sang King in the early 1990s.</p>
    <p>• An in­junc­tion has been granted for the farm­ers to stop RPD and the au­thor­i­ties from tak­ing over the lands that are un­der the com­pany.</p>
    <p>• The High Court will hear the mat­ter on</p>
    <p>Oct 28 and the farm­ers can con­tinue work­ing their lands un­til the court rules oth­er­wise.</p>
