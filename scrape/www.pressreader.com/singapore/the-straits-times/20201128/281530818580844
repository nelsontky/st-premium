    <p>WASHINGTON • United States Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump said on Thurs­day that he will leave the White House if the Elec­toral Col­lege votes for Pres­i­dent-elect Joe Bi­den, the clos­est he has come to con­ced­ing the Nov 3 elec­tion, even as he re­it­er­ated his un­founded claims of mas­sive voter fraud.</p>
    <p>Speak­ing to re­porters on the Thanks­giv­ing hol­i­day, the Repub­li­can Mr Trump said that if the Demo­crat Mr Bi­den – who is due to be sworn in on Jan 20 – is cer­ti­fied the elec­tion win­ner by the Elec­toral Col­lege, he will de­part from the White House.</p>
    <p>But Mr Trump said it would be hard for him to con­cede un­der the cur­rent cir­cum­stances, and de­clined to say whether he would at­tend Mr Bi­den’s in­au­gu­ra­tion.</p>
    <p>The elec­tors are sched­uled to meet on Dec 14.</p>
    <p>“This elec­tion was a fraud,” Mr Trump in­sisted, while of­fer­ing no con­crete ev­i­dence of such vot­ing ir­reg­u­lar­i­ties.</p>
    <p>Mr Bi­den and Mr Trump both stayed close to home to cel­e­brate Thanks­giv­ing on Thurs­day as the coro­n­avirus pan­demic raged across the coun­try.</p>
    <p>Mr Bi­den spent the hol­i­day in the small sea­side town of Re­hoboth, Delaware, where he and his wife Jill have a va­ca­tion home. The Bi­dens are host­ing their daugh­ter Ashley and her hus­band Howard Krein for the hol­i­day meal.</p>
    <p>The for­mer vice-pres­i­dent, ap­pear­ing with his wife in a video mes­sage posted to his Twit­ter ac­count on Thanks­giv­ing, said his fam­ily typ­i­cally holds a large gath­er­ing on the is­land of Nan­tucket, off Mas­sachusetts.</p>
    <p>How­ever, they would re­main in Delaware this year “with just a small group around our din­ner ta­ble” be­cause of the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>In the pres­i­den­tial-style ad­dress to a nation that has lost more than 260,000 lives to the coro­n­avirus, the Demo­cratic Pres­i­dent-elect said Amer­i­cans were mak­ing a “shared sac­ri­fice for the whole coun­try” and a “state­ment of com­mon pur­pose” by stay­ing at home with their im­me­di­ate fam­i­lies.</p>
    <p>“I know this isn’t the way many of us hoped we would spend our hol­i­day. We know that a small act of stay­ing home is a gift to our fel­low Amer­i­cans,” said Mr Bi­den. “I know bet­ter days are com­ing.”</p>
    <p>Mr Trump of­ten likes to cel­e­brate hol­i­days at his Mar-a-Largo re­sort in Florida.</p>
    <p>But on Thurs­day, he re­mained in the Washington area, spend­ing part of the morn­ing at his Trump Na­tional Golf Club in Vir­ginia, where he played a round of golf.</p>
    <p>It was a far cry from last year, when he made a sur­prise visit to Afghanista­n and served turkey to US troops be­fore sit­ting down to eat Thanks­giv­ing din­ner with them.</p>
    <p>This time, Mr Trump spoke by video link from the White House to mem­bers of the mil­i­tary.</p>
    <p>Mr Don­ald Trump said it would be hard for him to con­cede un­der the cur­rent cir­cum­stances and de­clined to say whether he would at­tend Mr Bi­den’s in­au­gu­ra­tion.</p>
