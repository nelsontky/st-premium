    <p>A man, smit­ten by his grand­mother’s neighbour, stalked the mar­ried woman from Novem­ber 2016 to June 2017.</p>
    <p>Tech­ni­cian Mo­hamed Sharizad Mo­hamed Sam­suri, 37, tracked her down on Face­book and, pos­ing as one of her friends, duped the 38-year-old into giv­ing him her mo­bile phone num­ber.</p>
    <p>This led to a string of threat­en­ing What­sApp text mes­sages af­ter she ig­nored his lewd mes­sages ask­ing for sex.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, Sharizad was sen­tenced to 19 weeks in jail af­ter plead­ing guilty to a ha­rass­ment charge.</p>
    <p>He also ad­mit­ted to an un­re­lated charge of possess­ing more than 700 video files from porno­graphic web­sites.</p>
    <p>Dis­trict Judge Marvin Bay, in sen­tenc­ing him, noted the steady es­ca­la­tion of his crim­i­nal behaviour.</p>
    <p>It went “from his rather be­nign be­gin­nings where he had ex­tended in­vi­ta­tions to add the vic­tim as a friend on Face­book... to di­rect sala­cious mes­sages, and then fi­nally to ut­terly lewd re­quests for her to per­form acts of fel­la­tio on him... with overt sin­is­ter threats to ex­pose her images and iden­tity on so­cial me­dia”, said the judge.</p>
    <p>The court heard t hat t he woman lived in the same block of flats as Sharizad’s grand­mother.</p>
    <p>The lo­ca­tion was not given in court doc­u­ments.</p>
    <p>Sharizad had spot­ted the vic­tim af­ter she moved into a unit there in 2009.</p>
    <p>When he failed to get her at­ten­tion, he turned to Face­book in early Novem­ber 2016, and cre­ated mul­ti­ple fake Face­book ac­counts un­der dif­fer­ent pseu­do­nyms, Deputy Public Pros­e­cu­tor Vin­cent Ong told a dis­trict court ear­lier this year.</p>
    <p>Sharizad used one of them to try to be­friend her, but she ig­nored his re­quest.</p>
    <p>He then pre­tended to be her friend on Face­book and de­ceived her into giv­ing out her mo­bile phone num­ber.</p>
    <p>In May 2017, he be­gan ha­rass­ing her, by call­ing her phone mul­ti­ple times.</p>
    <p>The fol­low­ing month, he sent her mul­ti­ple threat­en­ing mes­sages on What­sApp.</p>
    <p>In one of them, he en­closed a pic­ture of the woman which he had taken ear­lier and stated: “Don’t block me... or (you will) re­gret it.”</p>
    <p>The vic­tim made four po­lice re­ports in 2016 and 2017.</p>
    <p>He was ar­rested and ad­mit­ted to the of­fences on May 2, 2018.</p>
    <p>Po­lice later seized var­i­ous de­vices from him, in­clud­ing two lap­top com­put­ers where they found the ob­scene videos.</p>
