    <p>Sin­ga­pore and Malaysia are in dis­cus­sions on the Kuala Lumpur-Sin­ga­pore High-Speed Rail (HSR) pro­ject, and hope to come to a con­clu­sion by the end of the year, said Prime Min­is­ter Lee Hsien Loong .</p>
    <p>“The Malaysian side has given us cer­tain pro­pos­als on the changes, which we are study­ing care­fully and we’ll dis­cuss fur­ther with them,” he told re­porters after a cer­e­mony at the Cause­way to mark the re­sump­tion of the Jo­hor Baru-Sin­ga­pore Rapid Tran­sit Sys­tem (RTS) Link.</p>
    <p>The ba­sic think­ing be­hind the HSR – that Sin­ga­pore and Kuala Lumpur are two cities with sig­nif­i­cant links, and im­proved trans­porta­tion con­nec­tiv­ity will lead to more busi­ness and closer ties – re­mains true, said PM Lee.</p>
    <p>The 350km rail line would cut trav­el­ling time be­tween Malaysia’s cap­i­tal and Sin­ga­pore to 90 min­utes, com­pared with more than four hours by car. It would also halve the cur­rent end-to-end travel time of about five hours by aero­plane.</p>
    <p>With the com­ple­tion of the RTS Link agree­ment yes­ter­day, PM Lee said he was op­ti­mistic that Sin­ga­pore and Malaysia could like­wise fi­nalise the de­tails for the HSR pro­ject by the year end.</p>
    <p>For­mer Malaysian prime min­is­ter Ma­hathir Mo­hamad had ini­tially wanted to scrap the HSR as part of a re­view of his coun­try’s mega projects, in a bid to trim a RM1 tril­lion (S$325 bil­lion) na­tional debt.</p>
    <p>The Pakatan Hara­pan ad­min­is­tra­tion later clar­i­fied that it wanted to de­lay the start of con­struc­tion, as a can­cel­la­tion would have en­tailed a high amount of com­pen­sa­tion un­der the HSR agree­ment.</p>
    <p>The pro­ject was then shelved for two years un­til May 31, when then Trans­port Min­is­ter Khaw Boon Wan said that Sin­ga­pore had, in the spirit of bi­lat­eral co­op­er­a­tion, agreed to a fi­nal ex­ten­sion of the sus­pen­sion pe­riod for seven months till the end of this year.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, Sin­ga­pore’s new Trans­port Min­is­ter Ong Ye Kung said yes­ter­day that the two coun­tries will aim to start work on the RTS Link be­tween Wood­lands and Jo­hor Baru as soon as pos­si­ble.</p>
    <p>This partly de­pends on the pace of prepara­tory work as well as avail­abil­ity of work­ers, given the pre­vail­ing Covid-19 sit­u­a­tion, Mr Ong noted.</p>
    <p>“We want to start work as soon as we can and, im­por­tantly, to com­plete by end of 2026,” he said.</p>
    <p>Malaysian me­dia re­ported last week that con­struc­tion work on the RTS Link could be­gin in Jan­uary next year, once ap­provals are ob­tained from the rel­e­vant au­thor­i­ties of both coun­tries.</p>
    <p>Mr Ong said he has spo­ken with his Malaysian coun­ter­part Wee Ka Siong on find­ing ways to strengthen bi­lat­eral trans­port ties while keep­ing virus trans­mis­sion low, and that he also held a short meet­ing with Malaysia’s Se­nior Min­is­ter Azmin Ali about the pos­si­bil­ity of re­sum­ing the HSR pro­ject.</p>
    <p>In a joint state­ment is­sued after the cer­e­mony, both coun­tries said they had agreed on three key agree­ments to re­sume the RTS Link, in­clud­ing a joint ven­ture to form an op­er­at­ing com­pany.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore rail op­er­a­tor SMRT Cor­po­ra­tion has signed a joint ven­ture agree­ment with Prasarana Malaysia to form this com­pany, which is named RTS Op­er­a­tions.</p>
    <p>This Sin­ga­pore-in­cor­po­rated com­pany will de­sign, build, and fi­nance the RTS Link op­er­at­ing as­sets, in­clud­ing trains, tracks and sys­tems, said SMRT and Prasarana in a joint me­dia re­lease.</p>
    <p>It will also op­er­ate and main­tain the rail line be­tween Bukit Cha­gar in Jo­hor Baru and Wood­lands North in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>One key change to the pro­ject is the switch to an LRT sys­tem like those used in Malaysia, in­stead of us­ing the same trains and rail sys­tems on Sin­ga­pore’s Thom­son-East Coast Line, which is run by SMRT.</p>
    <p>A Sin­ga­pore Min­istry of Trans­port spokesman yes­ter­day said this LRT sys­tem is sim­i­lar to a medi­um­ca­pac­ity MRT line here, such as the up­com­ing Jurong Re­gion Line.</p>
    <p>Asked if any of Sin­ga­pore’s ex­ist­ing RTS con­tracts will be af­fected or can­celled due to the changes, the spokesman said: “The LRT sys­tem is com­pat­i­ble with our orig­i­nal in­fra­struc­ture de­sign based on the TEL sys­tem, with mi­nor de­sign updates to cater to the change of op­er­at­ing sys­tems.”</p>
