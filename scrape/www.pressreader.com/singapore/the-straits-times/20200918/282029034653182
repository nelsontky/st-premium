    <p>Whether China rises on the world stage as an es­teemed mem­ber of the global com­mu­nity or its as­cen­dancy is a lonely one rests on how it reaches out to other coun­tries amid the Covid-19 pan­demic, and the way it han­dles its ri­valry with the United States.</p>
    <p>Trade and In­dus­try Min­is­ter Chan Chun Sing made this point in a dis­cus­sion yes­ter­day, the fi­nal day of the Fu­tureChina Global Fo­rum.</p>
    <p>“This is a his­tor­i­cal op­por­tu­nity for China to win friends and build friend­ships, es­pe­cially in times of need, when the world is suf­fer­ing from the global pan­demic,” Mr Chan said.</p>
    <p>“How China reaches out to the rest of the world, sets the stan­dards in its be­hav­iour, would in­spire the rest of the world to come to­wards China.”</p>
    <p>The min­is­ter was re­spond­ing to a ques­tion by moder­a­tor Robin Hu on how China can po­si­tion it­self as a force for good and demon­strate lead­er­ship in ways that bring about trust and pros­per­ity.</p>
    <p>Mr Hu, who is a se­nior man­ag­ing direc­tor at Te­masek In­ter­na­tional, ear­lier posited that the ri­valry be­tween the two largest economies in the world is “seem­ingly push­ing (us) to­wards a new bipo­lar world or­der”.</p>
    <p>“With all the ner­vous en­ergy that is al­ready brew­ing, we need a con­struc­tive lead­er­ship, more than ever,” he said.</p>
    <p>Agree­ing, Mr Chan said ma­jor pow­ers like the US and China have a choice: whether to ex­er­cise their power in lead­er­ship, or to get their way.</p>
    <p>He said they “can ei­ther choose to demon­strate the power of the ex­am­ple, or the ex­am­ple of their power”.</p>
    <p>Urg­ing both coun­tries to remain benev­o­lent, he noted that China’s most pros­per­ous era in its long his­tory was when it was “most con­nected to the world, trad­ing with the rest of the world, ex­chang­ing ideas with the rest of the world”.</p>
    <p>This is also the case with to­day’s China, and this gen­er­a­tion of its lead­ers, he added.</p>
    <p>While gov­ern­ing China is not easy, given the nu­mer­ous com­plex­i­ties in the world’s most pop­u­lous na­tion, Mr Chan said that in his in­ter­ac­tions with Chi­nese lead­ers, they have shown that they are very de­ter­mined to stay con­nected with the rest of world. They know China’s pros­per­ity in the last few decades, which saw mil­lions lifted out of poverty, has been built on global trade, he noted – “a path that will not be eas­ily re­versed”.</p>
    <p>The nar­ra­tive of China’s lonely rise – with­out close part­ners and stand­ing apart from global norms – has been de­bated by ob­servers in re­cent years in think-tanks and pub­li­ca­tions. A sim­i­lar ques­tion was posted on Chi­nese ques­tion-and-an­swer site Zhihu last Novem­ber, draw­ing about 200 re­sponses from ne­ti­zens be­fore the thread was closed.</p>
    <p>From his ob­ser­va­tions, Mr Chan said, he is op­ti­mistic that China’s con­nec­tion with the world “can only deepen and strengthen”.</p>
    <p>In re­sponse to a ques­tion on how the US elec­tion will af­fect its re­la­tion­ship with China, Mr Chan urged ob­servers to look be­yond po­lit­i­cal per­son­al­i­ties to “the driv­ing forces of the re­spec­tive coun­tries”.</p>
    <p>The re­la­tion­ship be­tween the world’s top two economies is not purely an eco­nomic one, he said, adding that both coun­tries have shared in­ter­ests in many ar­eas.</p>
    <p>“Both of them would like to work to­gether to up­hold and up­date the global trad­ing sys­tem,” he said.</p>
    <p>China and the US are also con­cerned about the fi­nan­cial sta­bil­ity of global mar­kets, North Korea and the South China Sea, among oth­ers, he added.</p>
    <p>“The (over­lap­ping) ar­eas be­tween China and the US are mul­ti­fac­eted, and I hope that the lead­er­ship in both coun­tries will al­ways bear this in mind, even though they may com­pete in other ar­eas.”</p>
    <p>CHINA’S ROLE</p>
    <p>How China reaches out to the rest of the world, sets the stan­dards in its be­hav­iour, would in­spire the rest of the world to come to­wards China.</p>
    <p>TRADE AND IN­DUS­TRY MIN­IS­TER CHAN CHUN SING, in re­ply to a ques­tion on how China can po­si­tion it­self as a force for good.</p>
