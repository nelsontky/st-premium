    <p>Nearly 8,000 res­i­dents of River­side County in South­ern Cal­i­for­nia have been forced to flee their homes af­ter a wild­fire spread across more than 1,600ha last Satur­day. An­other wild­fire burn­ing near the Ari­zona-Utah state line has spread over 4,519ha.</p>
    <p>LOS AN­GE­LES • Nearly 8,000 res­i­dents of River­side County in South­ern Cal­i­for­nia were forced to evac­u­ate their homes last Satur­day as a wild­fire spread un­con­tained across more than 1,600ha, the county fire depart­ment said.</p>
    <p>The fire, dubbed the Ap­ple Fire by lo­cal fire­fight­ers, was re­ported last Fri­day in Cherry Val­ley, a com­mu­nity about 120km east of Los An­ge­les, and had de­stroyed at least one fam­ily home as of Satur­day evening. Pho­to­graphs shared by the River­side County fire depart­ment on Twit­ter on Satur­day showed thick plumes of smoke fill­ing the sky over the moun­tain­ous re­gion in the United States. Res­i­dents of 2,586 homes, to­talling around 7,800 peo­ple, had been told to evac­u­ate, the depart­ment said.</p>
    <p>The fire had grown from 283ha last Fri­day night to nearly 1,700ha the next night and was 0 per cent con­tained, the au­thor­i­ties said.</p>
    <p>An­other wild­fire burn­ing near the Ari­zona-Utah state line had spread across 4,519ha, the au­thor­i­ties said on Satur­day, adding that fire be­hav­iour would be ex­treme over the week­end due to dry fuel, high heat and er­ratic winds.</p>
    <p>The blaze, dubbed the Pine Hol­low Fire, was caused by light­ning on Wed­nes­day night and then was fu­elled by dry grass, brush and wood­land, In­ciWeb, an in­ter­state in­ci­dent in­for­ma­tion sys­tem, re­ported on its of­fi­cial web­site, say­ing that com­plex ter­rain and bad weather were ham­per­ing ef­forts to con­tain the blaze. Some 208 fire­fight­ers are bat­tling the blaze, the re­port said, with no re­ports so far of dam­age or in­juries. The fire was also 0 per cent con­tained.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, the num­ber of for­est fires in the Brazil­ian Ama­zon last month rose 28 per cent from July last year, satel­lite data showed on Satur­day, fu­elling fears that the world’s big­gest rain­for­est will again be dev­as­tated by fires this year.</p>
    <p>Brazil’s na­tional space agency INPE iden­ti­fied 6,803 fires in the Ama­zon re­gion in July, up from 5,318 the year be­fore. The fig­ure is all the more trou­bling given that 2019 was al­ready a dev­as­tat­ing year for fires in the Ama­zon, trig­ger­ing a global out­cry. That has put pres­sure on Brazil, which holds around 60 per cent of the Ama­zon, to do more to pro­tect the mas­sive for­est, seen as vi­tal to con­tain­ing the im­pact of cli­mate change.</p>
    <p>The fires are largely set to clear land il­le­gally for farm­ing, ranch­ing and min­ing. Ac­tivists ac­cuse Brazil­ian Pres­i­dent Jair Bol­sonaro, a far­right cli­mate change scep­tic, of en­cour­ag­ing the de­for­esta­tion with calls to open up the rain­for­est to agri­cul­ture and in­dus­try.</p>
    <p>Last Thurs­day alone, satel­lites de­tected 1,007 fires in the Ama­zon, INPE said. That was the worst sin­gle day for fires in the month of July since 2005, said en­vi­ron­men­tal group Green­peace.</p>
    <p>Mr Bol­sonaro has de­ployed the army to fight the fires, but ac­tivists say that does not go far enough to ad­dress the causes of the prob­lem.</p>
    <p>Fires in­creased 77 per cent on indige­nous lands and 50 per cent in pro­tected na­ture re­serves from July last year, Green­peace said, show­ing how il­le­gal ac­tiv­i­ties are in­creas­ingly en­croach­ing on those ar­eas.</p>
    <p>The fire sea­son in the re­gion typ­i­cally runs from around June to Oc­to­ber. Ex­ac­er­bat­ing the sit­u­a­tion this year, ex­perts say, is the re­sult­ing smoke that risks caus­ing a spike in res­pi­ra­tory emer­gen­cies in a re­gion al­ready hit hard by Covid-19.</p>
    <p>INPE data had al­ready showed it was a record-break­ing July for fires in the Brazil­ian Pan­tanal, the largest tropical wet­lands in the world. There were 1,684 fires there last month, more than triple the num­ber in July last year.</p>
