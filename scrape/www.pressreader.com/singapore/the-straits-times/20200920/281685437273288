    <p>BANGKOK • Thai­land’s monar­chy is pro­tected by one of the world’s tough­est royal defama­tion laws, mak­ing any crit­i­cism of the pow­er­ful King Maha Va­ji­ra­longkorn all but im­pos­si­ble inside the coun­try.</p>
    <p>Some stu­dent lead­ers have called for the abo­li­tion of the law as a prodemoc­racy movement gath­ers steam, with thou­sands protest­ing this week­end to de­mand re­forms to the monar­chy.</p>
    <p>WHAT IS THE ‘112’ LAW?</p>
    <p>Un­der Sec­tion 112 of Thai­land’s pe­nal code, any­one con­victed of de­fam­ing, in­sult­ing or threat­en­ing the king, queen, heir or re­gent faces be­tween three and 15 years in prison on each count.</p>
    <p>But the law is rou­tinely in­ter­preted to in­clude any crit­i­cism of any as­pect of the monar­chy – in­clud­ing con­tent posted or shared on so­cial me­dia.</p>
    <p>The harsh­est pun­ish­ment so far? A man was sen­tenced to 35 years in jail in 2017 for a se­ries of Face­book posts and com­ments about the royal fam­ily.</p>
    <p>HOW IS IT EN­FORCED?</p>
    <p>Any­one can make an ac­cu­sa­tion un­der the law, and the au­thor­i­ties are bound to in­ves­ti­gate. There is no trans­par­ent dis­clo­sure of the of­fi­cial num­ber of lese ma­jeste com­plaints, ar­rests, charges or sen­tences – only an in­con­sis­tent trickle of in­for­ma­tion from the au­thor­i­ties.</p>
    <p>But the use of Sec­tion 112 has risen dra­mat­i­cally since a 2014 coup by the arch-roy­al­ist mil­i­tary.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to legal aid groups, just six peo­ple were be­hind bars on lese ma­jeste con­vic­tions be­fore 2014. That num­ber sky­rock­eted in the fol­low­ing five years, with 169 con­vic­tions.</p>
    <p>Those charged are al­most al­ways con­victed. But if they plead guilty, sen­tences are of­ten halved.</p>
    <p>WHY ARE THERE SO MANY CASES UN­DER THE MIL­I­TARY?</p>
    <p>Legal ob­servers and rights cam­paign­ers say Sec­tion 112 and other laws like the Com­puter Crimes Act and sedi­tion laws have been used to tar­get dis­sent in Thai­land.</p>
    <p>The ul­tra-roy­al­ist mil­i­tary has long used its self-ap­pointed role as the de­fender of the monar­chy to jus­tify coups and po­lit­i­cal in­ter­ven­tions.</p>
    <p>But crit­ics say it has used the cover of pro­tect­ing the monar­chy to sti­fle po­lit­i­cal op­po­nents and tighten its hold on power.</p>
    <p>United Na­tions spe­cial rap­por­teur David Kaye urged the regime in 2017 to stop Sec­tion 112 pros­e­cu­tions, say­ing such laws “have no place in a demo­cratic coun­try”.</p>
    <p>The use of Sec­tion 112 has slowed re­cently. Prime Min­is­ter Prayut Chan-o-cha – leader of the 2014 coup – said in June that the King had re­quested that the gov­ern­ment re­frain from us­ing it.</p>
    <p>But it is not just the mil­i­tary – self-ap­pointed ul­tra-roy­al­ist civil­ian groups also mon­i­tor the Web and re­port al­leged 112 vi­o­la­tions.</p>
