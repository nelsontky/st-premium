    <p>TARO ASO</p>
    <p>The 79-year-old Fi­nance Min­is­ter, who also dou­bles as Deputy Prime Min­is­ter, has been a core mem­ber of Mr Shinzo Abe’s ad­min­is­tra­tion.</p>
    <p>In 2008, Mr Aso was elected Lib­eral Demo­cratic Party (LDP) leader and hence premier, in hopes that he could re­vive the long-dom­i­nant party’s for­tunes.</p>
    <p>In­stead, the LDP was ousted in a his­toric election de­feat in 2009, lan­guish­ing in the op­po­si­tion for the next three years.</p>
    <p>The grand­son of a for­mer premier, Mr Aso mixes pol­icy ex­pe­ri­ence with a fond­ness for manga comics and a ten­dency to­wards gaffes.</p>
    <p>SHIGERU ISHIBA</p>
    <p>A hawk­ish for­mer de­fence min­is­ter and rare LDP critic of Mr Abe, Mr Ishiba, 63, reg­u­larly tops sur­veys of law­mak­ers whom vot­ers want to see as the next premier, but is less pop­u­lar with the party’s law­mak­ers.</p>
    <p>The soft-spo­ken se­cu­rity maven has also held port­fo­lios for agri­cul­ture and re­viv­ing lo­cal economies.</p>
    <p>He de­feated Mr Abe in the first round of a party pres­i­den­tial election in 2012, thanks to strong grass­roots sup­port, but lost in the sec­ond round when only MPs could vote.</p>
    <p>Then, in a 2018 party lead­er­ship poll, Mr Ishiba lost heav­ily to Mr Abe.</p>
    <p>He has crit­i­cised the Bank of Ja­pan’s (BOJ) ul­tralow in­ter­est rates for hurt­ing re­gional banks and called for higher pub­lic works spend­ing to rem­edy grow­ing in­equal­ity.</p>
    <p>FU­MIO KISHIDA</p>
    <p>Mr Kishida, 63, served as for­eign min­is­ter un­der Mr Abe from 2012 to 2017, but di­plo­macy re­mained mainly in the Prime Min­is­ter’s grip.</p>
    <p>The low-key law­maker from Hiroshima has been widely seen as Mr Abe’s pre­ferred suc­ces­sor but ranks low in voter sur­veys.</p>
    <p>Mr Kishida hails from one of the party’s more dovish fac­tions and is seen as less keen on re­vis­ing the post-war Con­sti­tu­tion’s paci­fist Ar­ti­cle 9 than Mr Abe, for whom it is a cher­ished goal.</p>
    <p>The BOJ’s hy­per-easy mon­e­tary pol­icy “can­not go on for­ever”, Mr Kishida has said.</p>
    <p>TARO KONO</p>
    <p>The 56-year-old De­fence Min­is­ter has a rep­u­ta­tion as a mav­er­ick but has toed the line on key Abe poli­cies, in­clud­ing a stern stance in a feud with South Korea over wartime history.</p>
    <p>Ed­u­cated at Ge­orge­town Uni­ver­sity and a flu­ent English speaker, he pre­vi­ously served as for­eign min­is­ter and min­is­ter for ad­min­is­tra­tive re­form.</p>
    <p>He has dif­fer­en­ti­ated his con­ser­va­tive views from those of his fa­ther, for­mer chief Cab­i­net sec­re­tary Yo­hei Kono, who au­thored a land­mark 1993 apol­ogy to “com­fort women”, an eu­phemism for women forced to work in Ja­pan’s wartime mil­i­tary broth­els.</p>
    <p>YOSHI­HIDE SUGA</p>
    <p>Mr Suga, 71, a self-made politi­cian and loyal lieu­tenant since Mr Abe’s trou­bled term as premier in 2006 and 2007, was among a band of al­lies who pushed Mr Abe to run again for the top post in 2012.</p>
    <p>Back in of­fice, Mr Abe tapped Mr Suga as chief Cab­i­net sec­re­tary, act­ing as top gov­ern­ment spokesman, co­or­di­nat­ing poli­cies and keep­ing bu­reau­crats in line.</p>
    <p>Talk of Mr Suga as a con­tender sur­faced in April last year af­ter he un­veiled the new im­pe­rial-era name “Reiwa”, for use on Ja­panese cal­en­dars af­ter the en­throne­ment of the new em­peror.</p>
    <p>His clout was dented some­what by scan­dals that top­pled two Cab­i­net min­is­ters close to him last Oc­to­ber.</p>
    <p>SHIN­JIRO KOIZUMI</p>
    <p>The name of Mr Koizumi, 39, now En­vi­ron­ment Min­is­ter and the son of charis­matic for­mer premier Ju­nichiro Koizumi, is of­ten floated as a fu­ture premier, but many con­sider him too young.</p>
    <p>He shares some of Mr Abe’s con­ser­va­tive views and has paid his re­spects at Tokyo’s con­tro­ver­sial Ya­sukuni Shrine for the war dead.</p>
    <p>Mr Koizumi has pro­jected a re­formist im­age on the ba­sis of ef­forts to cut Ja­pan’s back­ing for coal, the dirt­i­est fos­sil fuel, but has typ­i­cally taken care not to of­fend party el­ders.</p>
    <p>TOSHIM­ITSU MOTEGI</p>
    <p>Cur­rently For­eign Min­is­ter, Mr Motegi, 64, pre­vi­ously served as econ­omy min­is­ter, fac­ing off with US Trade Rep­re­sen­ta­tive Robert Lighthizer in tough ne­go­ti­a­tions.</p>
    <p>He also served as trade min­is­ter un­der Mr Abe when the lat­ter re­turned to power in 2012, tack­ling talks on the Trans-Pa­cific Part­ner­ship free trade pact.</p>
    <p>Ed­u­cated at the Uni­ver­sity of Tokyo and Har­vard, Mr Motegi was first elected to the Lower House in 1993 from the then op­po­si­tion Ja­pan New Party and joined the LDP in 1995.</p>
    <p>KATSUNOBU KATO, YA­SU­TOSHI NISHIMURA</p>
    <p>As Health Min­is­ter, Mr Kato, 64, was in the lime­light in the early days of Ja­pan’s coro­n­avirus out­break, but then Econ­omy Min­is­ter Ya­su­toshi Nishimura, 57, a for­mer trade of­fi­cial, emerged as the point per­son on virus pol­icy.</p>
    <p>In 2015, Mr Kato, a fa­ther of four, was handed the port­fo­lio for boost­ing Ja­pan’s rock-bot­tom birth rate, a task that met lit­tle suc­cess.</p>
    <p>He is a for­mer of­fi­cial of the fi­nance min­istry.</p>
    <p>SEIKO NODA</p>
    <p>Ms Noda, 59, has made no se­cret of her de­sire to be­come Ja­pan’s first fe­male premier. An Abe critic, the for­mer in­ter­nal af­fairs min­is­ter, who also held the port­fo­lio for women’s em­pow­er­ment, fell short of back­ing to join the race for party leader in 2018.</p>
