    <p>ROME • Wine turned white with crushed fava beans. A soupy con­coc­tion of snails, sheep and fish.</p>
    <p>If these do not sound par­tic­u­larly ap­petis­ing to­day, they ap­pear to have been all the rage in an­cient Pom­peii, as ev­i­denced by an­cient left­overs found dur­ing ex­ca­va­tions this month at the ar­chae­o­log­i­cal site of the for­mer Ro­man city.</p>
    <p>They were found i n a ther­mopolium, or snack bar, serv­ing street food pop­u­lar in AD79.</p>
    <p>Two years after it was first partly un­earthed, ar­chae­ol­o­gists be­gan to ex­ca­vate the in­te­rior of the shop in Oc­to­ber.</p>
    <p>This month, they found food and drink residue that is ex­pected to pro­vide fresh clues about the an­cient pop­u­la­tion’s culi­nary tastes.</p>
    <p>The dig of­fers new in­sight into daily life in Pom­peii and rep­re­sents the first time an area of this type has been ex­ca­vated in its en­tirety and an­a­lysed with mod­ern tech­nol­ogy, Pro­fes­sor Mas­simo Osanna, the de­part­ing direc­tor of the Ar­chae­o­log­i­cal Park of Pom­peii, said in a state­ment last Satur­day.</p>
    <p>Hu­man life in Pom­peii came to an abrupt halt nearly 2,000 years ago, when Mount Ve­su­vius erupted and spilt lapilli, ash and rock onto the an­cient Ro­man city, pre­serv­ing it in time.</p>
    <p>Over the cen­turies, Pom­peii be­came a pow­er­ful sym­bol of the tran­sience of life and hu­man im­po­tence when na­ture un­leashes its power.</p>
    <p>Since ex­ca­va­tions be­gan in 1748, frag­ments of the an­cient civil­i­sa­tion have con­tin­ued to emerge, pro­vid­ing clues to ar­chae­ol­o­gists and his­to­ri­ans on how res­i­dents might have lived, dressed and eaten.</p>
    <p>About 80 ther­mopolii have been found at Pom­peii, where res­i­dents could choose food from con­tain­ers set into street-front coun­ters.</p>
    <p>The one ex­ca­vated this month in­cluded a large dolium, or earth­en­ware ves­sel, that had con­tained wine.</p>
    <p>“It was full of lapilli, and re­mov­ing them re­leased a very in­tense aroma of wine,” said Ms Teresa Vir­tu­oso, the ar­chae­ol­o­gist over­see­ing the team ex­ca­vat­ing the site. “It was so strong we could smell it through our masks.”</p>
    <p>Al­though the ar­chae­o­log­i­cal park has been closed for part of this year be­cause of the coro­n­avirus pan­demic, ex­ca­va­tions have con­tin­ued, with ar­chae­ol­o­gists tak­ing pre­cau­tions.</p>
    <p>In an­other dolium, they found the skele­tal re­mains of a mouse, sug­gest­ing the ves­sel might have con­tained grains of some kind and that the mouse – like the res­i­dents of an­cient Pom­peii – fell vic­tim to the erup­tion, Ms Vir­tu­oso said.</p>
    <p>The con­tents of two other jars have yet to be an­a­lysed, but Dr Chiara Corbino, the ar­chaeo­zo­ol­o­gist in­volved in the dig, said it ap­peared that they con­tained two kinds of dishes: a pork and fish com­bi­na­tion found “in other con­texts at Pom­peii”, and a con­coc­tion in­volv­ing snails, fish and sheep, per­haps a soup or stew.</p>
    <p>Fur­ther anal­y­sis is ex­pected to de­ter­mine whether veg­eta­bles were part of the an­cient recipe.</p>
    <p>“We will an­a­lyse the con­tents to de­ter­mine the in­gre­di­ents and bet­ter un­der­stand what kind of dish it was,” she said.</p>
    <p>For now, she thinks the ther­mopolium prob­a­bly served a stew or soup that in­cluded “all these an­i­mals to­gether”.</p>
    <p>The re­mains of at l east two peo­ple were found in­side the shop.</p>
    <p>Ar­chae­ol­o­gists be­lieve that tomb rob­bers moved the bones in the 17th cen­tury be­cause the skele­tons found this month were not in­tact.</p>
    <p>Italy’s cul­ture min­is­ter Dario Frances­chini said last Satur­day that the ex­ca­va­tions at Pom­peii con­tin­ued to de­liver ex­tra­or­di­nary dis­cov­er­ies. “To­day, Pom­peii is in­di­cated in the world as an ex­am­ple of pro­tec­tion and man­age­ment,” he said in a state­ment.</p>
