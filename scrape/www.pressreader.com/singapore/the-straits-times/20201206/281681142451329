    <p>•</p>
    <p>RIO DE JANEIRO When a young woman joined her fam­ily for a bar­be­cue one re­cent Sun­day in south­ern Brazil, soon af­ter a night on the town, she had no idea she would in­fect 18 rel­a­tives with the coro­n­avirus, and three of them would even­tu­ally die.</p>
    <p>Young Brazil­ians, en­er­gised by the ar­rival of sum­mer and suf­fer­ing from so­cial dis­tanc­ing fa­tigue af­ter months of re­stric­tions, have taken to the streets and beaches to party in in­creas­ing num­bers.</p>
    <p>Pub­lic health ex­perts warn that an ac­cel­er­ated trans­mis­sion rate among young peo­ple has been a ma­jor con­trib­u­tor to a surge in coro­n­avirus cases and deaths that they fear may be a se­cond wave hit­ting Latin Amer­ica’s largest na­tion.</p>
    <p>Con­firmed cases i n the past week have risen to a three-month high in Brazil and deaths have jumped over the last month.</p>
    <p>With over 6.5 mil­lion in­fec­tions and more than 175,000 deaths, Brazil has the third-big­gest out­break, af­ter the United States and In­dia, and the se­cond-high­est death toll, af­ter the US.</p>
    <p>Although young peo­ple are less likely to die from the dis­ease, they of­ten bring the virus home to fam­ily mem­bers whose age or prior med­i­cal con­di­tions put them at risk, filling up in­ten­sive care beds in many cities’ hos­pi­tals.</p>
    <p>Cu­ritiba Health Sec­re­tary Mar­cia Hu­cu­lak re­vealed the case of the young woman as she made an ap­peal to peo­ple to avoid gath­er­ings, even within fam­i­lies.</p>
    <p>State health of­fi­cials de­clined to pro­vide the woman’s name or other iden­ti­fy­ing in­for­ma­tion, cit­ing pri­vacy con­cerns.</p>
    <p>“We are see­ing very sad cases like this one of the woman who went to a party and then on Sun­day at­tended her fam­ily’s BBQ,” she said.</p>
    <p>Young adults have felt the great­est men­tal im­pact from pro­longed so­cial iso­la­tion, with 54 per cent say­ing they are de­pressed and 70 per cent anx­ious or of­ten ner­vous, ac­cord­ing to re­search.</p>
    <p>Eas­ing re­stric­tions in Brazil­ian cities has led to crowded bars and restau­rants.</p>
    <p>With the ap­proach­ing hol­i­day sea­son, ex­perts worry that Covid-19 will spread even faster.</p>
    <p>Sev­eral cities that were dis­man­tling field hos­pi­tals used to re­ceive Covid-19 pa­tients in the first stage of the pan­demic are now scram­bling for more hos­pi­tal ca­pac­ity.</p>
    <p>As cities and states ease re­stric­tions, how­ever, trans­mis­sion has picked up, with the last week av­er­ag­ing 34,700 cases and 520 deaths a day.</p>
    <p>Rio de Janeiro has post­poned un­til June its fa­mous car­ni­val party, but that has not stopped prepa­ra­tions for New Year’s Eve cel­e­bra­tions that draw large crowds every year. Tick­ets are on sale for par­ties atop the city’s iconic Su­gar­loaf Moun­tain.</p>
