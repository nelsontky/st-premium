    <p>A morn­ing task to pick up a fam­ily mem­ber from the Se­larang Park Com­plex drug re­ha­bil­i­ta­tion cen­tre turned out to be a painful ex­pe­ri­ence last Fri­day.</p>
    <p>I first went to the mid­dle build­ing in the three-build­ing com­plex and was told that I had to go to the ad­ja­cent one in­stead.</p>
    <p>It was dis­con­cert­ing to see the peo­ple there pay­ing no heed to the no­tices about safe dis­tanc­ing – freely shak­ing hands and ex­chang­ing greet­ings. Af­ter a wor­ri­some wait, I was di­rected to a third build­ing.</p>
    <p>I had to walk out to the road to get to it and when I got there, the of­fi­cer at the guard­house pointed me back to the build­ing I had just come from. I sug­gested that he check with some­one in the build­ing about the sta­tus of my fam­ily mem­ber first. Af­ter a wait, I was fi­nally al­lowed into the build­ing only to be told that I was at the wrong place and that I was to go back to the guard­house and wait there in­stead.</p>
    <p>About 10 min­utes later, my fam­ily mem­ber walked out of the build­ing.</p>
    <p>I had some ques­tions for the of­fi­cer ac­com­pa­ny­ing him but he re­fused to en­ter­tain me, say­ing his job was only to ac­com­pany the per­son be­ing re­leased to the guard­house.</p>
    <p>Af­ter all the un­help­ful di­rec­tions and messy com­mu­ni­ca­tion be­tween of­fi­cers, there was no apol­ogy from any­one.</p>
    <p>It is wor­ri­some that at this high-se­cu­rity com­plex, where dis­ci­pline and pro­ce­dures are usu­ally the order of the day, there was lit­tle of these.</p>
