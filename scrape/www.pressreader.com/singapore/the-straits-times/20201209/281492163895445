    <p>A 90-year-old grand­mother in Bri­tain be­came the world’s first per­son to re­ceive a fully tested Covid-19 shot yes­ter­day. Bri­tain be­gan mass-vac­ci­nat­ing its peo­ple in a global drive that poses one of the big­gest lo­gis­ti­cal chal­lenges in peace­time his­tory.</p>
    <p>Health workers started in­oc­u­lat­ing the most vul­ner­a­ble with the vac­cine de­vel­oped by Pfizer and BioNTech, with the coun­try a test case for the world as it con­tends with dis­tribut­ing a com­pound that must be stored at mi­nus 70 deg C.</p>
    <p>Ms Mar­garet Keenan, who turns 91 in a week, was the first to re­ceive the shot, at a hos­pi­tal in Coven­try, cen­tral Eng­land.</p>
    <p>CONVENTRY • Nurses cheered yes­ter­day as a 90-year-old grand­mother in Bri­tain be­came the first per­son in the Western world to re­ceive an ap­proved vac­cine against Covid-19, at the start of a marathon cam­paign health of­fi­cials hope her­alds a fight-back against the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Ms Mar­garet Keenan, who turns 91 next week, called the jab she re­ceived at a hos­pi­tal in Coven­try, cen­tral Eng­land, “the best early birth­day present”.</p>
    <p>“My ad­vice to any­one of­fered the vac­cine is to take it. If I can have it at 90, then you can have it too,” said the for­mer j ewellery shop worker who has two chil­dren and four grand­chil­dren. “I feel so priv­i­leged to be the first per­son vac­ci­nated against Covid-19.”</p>
    <p>Reg­u­la­tors in Bri­tain – one of the worst-af­fected coun­tries with more than 61,000 deaths from 1.6 mil­lion cases – be­came the first to ap­prove the Pfizer-BioNTech vac­cine for gen­eral use last week.</p>
    <p>Ms Keenan, wear­ing a Christ­mas­themed T-shirt, re­ceived the jab in front of cam­eras at 0631 GMT (2.31pm Sin­ga­pore time), and re­ceived a guard of hon­our made up of clap­ping medics as she was wheeled back to her bed.</p>
    <p>She was fol­lowed by a man called Wil­liam Shake­speare who, like the world-fa­mous play­wright, is from War­wick­shire.</p>
    <p>Ms May Par­sons, a nurse orig­i­nally from the Philip­pines who has worked for Bri­tain’s state-run Na­tional Health Ser­vice for 23 years, called it a “huge hon­our” to ad­min­is­ter the jab to Ms Keenan.</p>
    <p>Peo­ple over 80, care home workers and at-risk health and so­cial care staff are first in line to get the jab, on what has been dubbed “VDay”. A sec­ond jab is re­quired after 21 days.</p>
    <p>Prime Min­is­ter Boris John­son, who spent days in in­ten­sive care with Covid-19 ear­lier this year, called it “a tremen­dous shot in the arm for the en­tire na­tion”.</p>
    <p>But with most peo­ple not ex­pected to get vac­ci­nated un­til early next year, he said the pub­lic still needs to be care­ful. “We can’t af­ford to re­lax,” he said on a visit to a cen­tral London hos­pi­tal.</p>
    <p>The United King­dom has or­dered 40 mil­lion doses of the jab – enough to vac­ci­nate 20 mil­lion peo­ple – with 800,000 in the first batch. Up to four mil­lion doses are ex­pected by the end of this month.</p>
    <p>Else­where in the world, China and Rus­sia have also started vac­ci­nat­ing their cit­i­zens against Covid-19 in mass in­oc­u­la­tion cam­paigns.</p>
    <p>The pub­lic in Bri­tain has largely wel­comed the rapid ap­proval of the vac­cine, but min­is­ters and health pro­fes­sion­als are aware they still need to com­bat mis­trust.</p>
    <p>Re­ports sug­gest that Queen El­iz­a­beth II, who at 94 is among those first in the line for the vac­ci­na­tion be­cause of her age, could front a pub­lic aware­ness cam­paign urg­ing com­pli­ance. The gov­ern­ment said it would hand out vac­cine cards to re­mind peo­ple to get the booster after three weeks, but in­sisted it was not in­tro­duc­ing im­mu­nity cer­tifi­cates or mak­ing jabs com­pul­sory.</p>
    <p>In Ed­in­burgh, project en­gi­neer Sean Wil­son, 36, said that on bal­ance, vac­ci­na­tion would be ben­e­fi­cial. “I think ev­ery­body should go for it,” he added. “What is the worst that could hap­pen? It couldn’t get any worse re­ally than what it is now.”</p>
    <p>Ms Keenan said she had not made his­tory be­fore but was very proud to have played her part. For now, though, she said she planned to have a lit­tle rest.</p>
    <p>There were 12 new coro­n­avirus cases con­firmed as of yes­ter­day, tak­ing Sin­ga­pore’s to­tal to 58,285.</p>
    <p>All 12 cases were im­ported and had been placed on stay-home no­tice on ar­rival in Sin­ga­pore, said the Min­istry of Health (MOH).</p>
    <p>The new cases com­prised one Sin­ga­porean, two per­ma­nent res­i­dents, eight work per­mit hold­ers and one short-term visit pass holder.</p>
    <p>The Sin­ga­porean, a 17-year-old girl re­turn­ing from Bri­tain, ex­pe­ri­enced the on­set of symp­toms on</p>
    <p>Mon­day and was con­firmed pos­i­tive yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The other two symp­to­matic cases in­cluded a 40-year-old man who is a per­ma­nent res­i­dent and a 30-year-old woman who is a work per­mit holder. Both ar­rived here from In­done­sia and ex­pe­ri­enced symp­toms last Satur­day and Mon­day re­spec­tively.</p>
    <p>The re­main­ing nine cases were asymp­to­matic and were de­tected through proac­tive screen­ing and sur­veil­lance, the min­istry said yes­ter­day night.</p>
    <p>They in­clude the other per­ma­nent res­i­dent – a 37-year-old woman who re­turned from In­dia – and seven work per­mit hold­ers cur­rently em­ployed in Sin­ga­pore who ar­rived from In­done­sia and Myan­mar.</p>
    <p>The last case – a short-term visit pass holder who ar­rived from Qatar – was al­ready re­ceiv­ing med­i­cal care in Sin­ga­pore and had re­turned for fur­ther treat­ment.</p>
    <p>They were all tested while serv­ing their stay-home no­tice at ded­i­cated fa­cil­i­ties.</p>
    <p>There were no new cases in workers’ dor­mi­to­ries and none in the com­mu­nity yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>MOH said the num­ber of new cases in the com­mu­nity has re­mained low, with a to­tal of one case in the past week, that is linked to a pre­vi­ous case.</p>
    <p>With eight cases dis­charged yes­ter­day, 58,161 pa­tients have fully re­cov­ered from the dis­ease.</p>
    <p>A to­tal of 23 pa­tients re­main in hos­pi­tal, with none in in­ten­sive care, while 57 pa­tients are re­cu­per­at­ing in com­mu­nity fa­cil­i­ties.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore has had 29 deaths from Covid-19 com­pli­ca­tions, while 15 who tested pos­i­tive have died of other causes.</p>
    <p>With eight cases dis­charged yes­ter­day, 58,161 pa­tients have fully re­cov­ered from the dis­ease. A to­tal of 23 pa­tients re­main in hos­pi­tal, with none in in­ten­sive care, while 57 pa­tients are re­cu­per­at­ing in com­mu­nity fa­cil­i­ties.</p>
