    <p>OR­LANDO (Florida) • The Los An­ge­les Clip­pers, boosted by a good shoot­ing night, got off to a roar­ing start in their West­ern Con­fer­ence semi-fi­nal se­ries on Thurs­day by crush­ing t he Den­ver Nuggets 120-97.</p>
    <p>Kawhi Leonard scored 29 points, and the Clip­pers won Game 1 at the Na­tional Basketball As­so­ci­a­tion (NBA) bub­ble near Or­lando af­ter shoot­ing 57 per cent from the field.</p>
    <p>That con­vinced their coach Doc Rivers that his play­ers are fully fo­cused on the task at hand and are in the proper frame of mind for the post-sea­son.</p>
    <p>He said on ESPN: “If you don’t ex­e­cute, it’s go­ing to hurt you, and part of that is in­ten­sity and fo­cus, and you have to have that on ev­ery sin­gle play.</p>
    <p>“I don’t think we un­der­stood that early on. I think we do now.”</p>
    <p>Leonard con­nected on 12 of 16 shots from the floor in 32 min­utes, sit­ting out the fourth quar­ter.</p>
    <p>Al­though his streak of five con­sec­u­tive games with 32 or more points ended, he has scored at least 29 points in each of the Clip­pers’ seven play-off games.</p>
    <p>He is av­er­ag­ing 32.3 points per game in the post-sea­son.</p>
    <p>Paul Ge­orge con­tributed 19 points and seven re­bounds and Mar­cus Mor­ris Sr added 18 points, con­vert­ing seven of 10 shots and four of five three-point at­tempts for the Clip­pers.</p>
    <p>Nikola Jo­kic had 15 points for the Nuggets, who shot just 42 per cent, and Paul Mill­sap fin­ished with 13 points, nine re­bounds and three steals.</p>
    <p>Ja­mal Murray, Jerami Grant and Monte Mor­ris chipped in 12 points apiece for the Nuggets, who had only one day off af­ter clinch­ing their seven-game se­ries on Tues­day against the Utah Jazz.</p>
    <p>All in all, their starters com­bined to score just 57 points on 20-for-48 shoot­ing. The Clip­pers’ start­ing line-up, mean­while, had 78 points on 30-for-47 shoot­ing.</p>
    <p>“They were ag­gres­sive,” Jo­kic said. “Our spac­ing was not good. We rushed shots. You can say what­ever. It was a bad, bad night for us. We can be bet­ter.”</p>
    <p>Game 2 in the se­ries is to­day. Den­ver coach Michael Malone blamed his side’s poor shoot­ing night on hav­ing in­ad­e­quate rest.</p>
    <p>He said: “I think that def­i­nitely played a part.</p>
    <p>“Their last game was Sun­day. We had our last game on Tues­day night and didn’t get back to the ho­tel un­til af­ter mid­night. We were tired.</p>
    <p>“To­mor­row we will get them as much as rest as we can and have a more en­er­getic per­for­mance on Satur­day night.”</p>
