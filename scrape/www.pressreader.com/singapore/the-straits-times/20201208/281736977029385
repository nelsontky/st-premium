    <p>South Korean Pres­i­dent Moon Jae-in has urged the coun­try’s author­i­ties to un­der­take more ef­forts in track­ing and trac­ing coro­n­avirus in­fec­tions. This comes as tight­ened mea­sures have failed to re­duce daily in­fec­tions. Yes­ter­day, the coun­try re­ported 615 new Covid-19 cases, rais­ing the to­tal to 38,161.</p>
    <p>Health of­fi­cials have warned the num­ber of new daily cases could spike to over 900 next week if the pace of in­fec­tion con­tin­ues. New curbs from to­day in­clude a ban on gath­er­ings of 50 or more peo­ple and clo­sure of some 130,000 in­fec­tion-prone fa­cil­i­ties.</p>
    <p>In meet­ings with aides yes­ter­day, Mr Moon called on the gov­ern­ment to mo­bilise “ev­ery avail­able per­son­nel”, from civil ser­vants to those in the mil­i­tary and po­lice, to pro­vide on-site sup­port for epi­demi­o­log­i­cal in­ves­ti­ga­tions start­ing this week.</p>
    <p>He also stressed the need to set up more driv­ethrough test cen­tres and ex­pand the op­er­at­ing hours of test­ing fa­cil­i­ties to al­low of­fice work­ers and young peo­ple to go for test­ing more con­ve­niently, ac­cord­ing to the pres­i­den­tial Blue House.</p>
    <p>Mr Moon also in­structed of­fi­cials to push for the use of rapid anti­gen tests that can pro­duce re­sults in just 15 min­utes, as com­pared with the six hours the poly­merase chain re­ac­tion (PRC) tests re­quire.</p>
    <p>“We have over­come the coro­n­avirus cri­sis sev­eral times, but the sit­u­a­tion now is more se­ri­ous than ever,” he said, cit­ing the wor­ry­ing trend of in­creased asymp­to­matic trans­mis­sion.</p>
    <p>Mr Moon also warned that an “un­con­trol­lable na­tion­wide pan­demic” could en­sue if the coun­try failed to curb the spread of the virus this time.</p>
    <p>His mes­sage came as South Korea im­posed an­other round of re­stric­tions in Seoul and greater Seoul. From to­day, the so­cial dis­tanc­ing level will be raised one notch to 2.5 – the fourth in a five-tier sys­tem – for three weeks. It means ban­ning gath­er­ings of 50 or more peo­ple, and clos­ing karaoke rooms and in­door sports fa­cil­i­ties, which were pre­vi­ously al­lowed to run un­til 9pm. Spec­ta­tors are no longer al­lowed at sport­ing events, and re­li­gious ac­tiv­i­ties must go on­line. El­e­men­tary schools can run only at one-third ca­pac­ity, while mid­dle and high schools con­tinue to con­duct lessons on­line.</p>
    <p>Start­ing to­day, the sub­way in Seoul will cut ca­pac­ity by 30 per cent af­ter 9pm, in line with the city’s plan to “stop Seoul” from 9pm to curb the worst bout of in­fec­tions since March. In place since last Satur­day, the cur­few also ap­plies to malls, cin­e­mas, beauty sa­lons and su­per­mar­kets.</p>
    <p>Health Min­is­ter Park Ne­ung-hoo said Seoul and greater Seoul are al­ready in a state of “war” against the virus, as their daily in­fec­tion fig­ure surged to a nine-month high of 470 on Sun­day, be­fore drop­ping to 440 yes­ter­day. He also voiced con­cern over two con­sec­u­tive days of 600-plus caseloads na­tion­ally. “Un­less we curb the spread of the virus... we will see an ex­plo­sive spread of in­fec­tions and the coun­try’s med­i­cal sys­tem will fal­ter,” he said.</p>
    <p>Mr Alexan­der Kim, 46, whose in­door golf sim­u­la­tor club will have to close for three weeks, said his earn­ings this month are just a frac­tion of his rent and man­age­ment fees. “Win­ter is peak sea­son for us but now we can­not even open for business,” he told The Straits Times. “I just hope the third wave will be over soon. Mean­while, I can spend more time with family.”</p>
