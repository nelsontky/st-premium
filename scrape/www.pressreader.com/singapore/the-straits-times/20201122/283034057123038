    <p>•</p>
    <p>Ten­nis Aus­tralia (TA) yes­ter­day dis­missed mul­ti­ple me­dia re­ports claim­ing the start of the Aus­tralian Open is set to be pushed back from Jan­uary to Fe­bru­ary or March due to Covid-19 pro­to­cols in the coun­try.</p>
    <p>The Her­ald Sun quoted Vic­to­ria Premier Daniel An­drews as say­ing he was “very con­fi­dent” of host­ing the event but the ex­act tim­ing and ar­range­ments “are not set­tled yet”.</p>
    <p>How­ever, with the state govern­ment yet to of­fi­cially sign off on any tour­na­ments, the news­pa­per yes­ter­day said the year’s first Grand Slam risked be­ing de­ferred.</p>
    <p>The Aus­tralian Open has not been held out­side of Jan­uary since 1987 and or­gan­is­ers are dis­cussing quar­an­tine ar­range­ments with the Vic­to­ria state govern­ment.</p>
    <p>In re­sponse to the re­ports, TA in­sisted noth­ing had been fi­nalised yet. “It’s pure spec­u­la­tion,” its spokesman said.</p>
    <p>“Ear­lier in the week, we... (said) how we con­tinue to work closely with the Vic­to­rian govern­ment and we will up­date with more in­for­ma­tion as soon as pos­si­ble, and there’s no up­date from that at the mo­ment.”</p>
    <p>Aus­tralian ten­nis com­men­ta­tor Brett Phillips be­lieves the hard­court Grand Slam “is cer­tain to be de­layed, but a fi­nal de­ci­sion has not been reached on if it will be de­layed by weeks or months”.</p>
    <p>He told lo­cal ra­dio sta­tion 1116 SEN yes­ter­day: “It’s chaos, it’s del­i­cate dis­cus­sions, it’s crazy.</p>
    <p>“It’s in­cred­i­ble times for TA. I’d hate to be a TA ad­min­is­tra­tor or a sports ad­min­is­tra­tor full stop in 2020.</p>
    <p>“Next year, it’s not go­ing to get back to nor­mal for so many sports.</p>
    <p>“My strong feel­ing, just on the sit­u­a­tion that’s hap­pened in Vic­to­ria in the past seven or eight months and our Premier, who’s taken a fair bit of crit­i­cism for the whole ho­tel quar­an­tine bun­gle, is that they’re tak­ing a very cau­tious ap­proach.</p>
    <p>“I’ve just got a very strong feel­ing the Aus­tralian Open is go­ing to be pushed back pos­si­bly to March or April.</p>
    <p>“This is cer­tainly one of the sce­nar­ios that was on the ta­ble, it was talked about.</p>
    <p>“There’s no doubt the Aus­tralian Open won’t hap­pen on its sched­uled date.</p>
    <p>“It’s just a mat­ter of whether they move it back a week or push it back to March, April.”</p>
    <p>The TA had planned for play­ers and their en­tourages to ar­rive in Vic­to­ria in mid-De­cem­ber to have time to un­der­take a manda­tory two-week quar­an­tine pe­riod.</p>
    <p>But lo­cal au­thor­i­ties are against any early ar­rival and they have also not con­firmed whether prac­tice will be al­lowed dur­ing quar­an­tine.</p>
