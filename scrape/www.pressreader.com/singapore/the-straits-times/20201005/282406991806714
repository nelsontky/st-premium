    <p>Q In a run, I tend to move be­tween zones 2-4 de­pend­ing on the ter­rain and how tired I am that day. Is there a per­cent­age for each zone that I should re­main in?</p>
    <p>What is the dif­fer­ence be­tween your train­ing zones and the max­i­mum/ av­er­age heart rate that is com­monly rec­om­mended? Based on my age</p>
    <p>(45 years), my HR­max should be 220-45=175 and 85% is 149. But my av­er­age HR in a nor­mal run (pace: 7:30-8:30min/km) is usu­ally 155 (with an oc­ca­sional max­i­mum of 170s). If I were to fol­low the chart for tar­get HR zones, does it mean that my heart is overex­ert­ing it­self?</p>
    <p>A Heart rate will go up and down de­pend­ing on the ter­rain, that’s fine. The key is to have as lit­tle de­vi­a­tion as pos­si­ble and not to spend ex­tended pe­ri­ods in higher zones. Aim for around 80-plus per cent of train­ing to be in zones 1 and 2.</p>
    <p>The qual­ity of train­ing zones is es­sen­tial. So when cre­at­ing the on­line train­ing pro­gramme, I used clients’ lac­tate re­sults, the gold stan­dard for zone cal­cu­la­tions, to find out which of the pop­u­lar HR for­mu­las they were most con­sis­tent with. The end re­sult is the one I shared.</p>
    <p>De­pend­ing on your ge­netic make-up, it may or may not be ac­cu­rate for you. It’s a great place to start, though.</p>
    <p>If you’re con­sis­tently in zone 3 and above, I be­lieve you are putting more stress on your body and heart than you should be. Have the con­fi­dence to ease off a lit­tle and watch as your pace be­gin to in­crease at the same HR, thanks to im­prove­ments in aer­o­bic fit­ness.</p>
    <p>Q I am 48 years old, the­o­ret­i­cal max­i­mum HR is 172 bpm. I run 3-5 times a week. Dur­ing my HR train­ing and 21km/42km races, my HR can av­er­age 160-175. Just won­der­ing if I am push­ing my­self too hard?</p>
    <p>A Ev­ery­one is dif­fer­ent. If you have an un­usu­ally high heart rate (like me), it is not nec­es­sar­ily a bad thing, but there’s a chance HR for­mu­las will not be ac­cu­rate for you.</p>
    <p>Con­sider vis­it­ing a lab, like the one we run at Coached, and do a lac­tate test. This in­vest­ment will en­sure the zones, based on your phys­i­ol­ogy, will be as ac­cu­rate as it gets.</p>
    <p>If you are us­ing a for­mula to cal­cu­late your zones, use the one in my pre­vi­ous col­umn.</p>
    <p>Q I am in the healthy BMI range. But my body fat re­sults showed that I am obese and my skele­tal mus­cle is very poor. I have a vis­ceral fat of 2.5. What could have caused this? And how do I im­prove the re­sults?</p>
    <p>A The ac­cu­racy of body com­po­si­tion mea­sure­ments vary greatly be­tween meth­ods.</p>
    <p>As­sum­ing the re­sults are ac­cu­rate, the cause of ex­cess fat is all the small choices you make ev­ery day. The foods you eat, the sleep you get, ex­er­cise habits among other things af­fect meta­bolic health and how ef­fec­tive you are at burn­ing fat.</p>
    <p>If you wish to lose fat, there are a few sim­ple things I would rec­om­mend to get you started.</p>
    <p>• Lower car­bo­hy­drates in­take and in­crease healthy fats to reg­u­late in­sulin lev­els and im­prove fat burn­ing.</p>
    <p>• Do reg­u­lar low-in­ten­sity ex­er­cise (zones 1 and 2).</p>
    <p>• Do reg­u­lar strength ex­er­cises to build mus­cle. I like body-weight ex­er­cises; they are so sim­ple and can be done any­where. Plank, squats, lunges, pull-ups and press-ups are great ways to start.</p>
    <p>• Get 7- plus hours of sleep a night.</p>
    <p>• Re­duce stress and anx­i­ety. In my ex­pe­ri­ence, the In­ter­net and par­tic­u­larly smart­phones pro­duce a lot of anx­i­ety. I no longer use so­cial me­dia, keep my phone in greyscale and sig­nif­i­cantly limit In­ter­net us­age. It’s proven very ef­fec­tive for me.</p>
    <p>Q I have been run­ning reg­u­larly but ev­ery time dur­ing a long run/race, af­ter 2 hours I get leg cramps. What causes it and how can I pre­vent it?</p>
    <p>A Cramp is caused by two pri­mary things.</p>
    <p>First, mus­cle fa­tigue: The qual­ity of your train­ing and race ex­e­cu­tion de­ter­mines how re­sis­tant your mus­cles are to fa­tigue. So it’s im­por­tant to train reg­u­larly and pro­gres­sively. In a race, you need to run at an even pace to avoid ex­ces­sive stress on mus­cles. In my ex­pe­ri­ence, most run­ners start too hard, which can lead to cramp.</p>
    <p>Sec­ond, lack of sodium: You lose sodium when you sweat. Sodium helps to reg­u­late fluid bal­ance and blood vol­ume while help­ing to main­tain mus­cle and nerve func­tion.</p>
    <p>The amount of sodium you lose in sweat is ge­netic, so some peo­ple lose as lit­tle as 200 mg/l and oth­ers more than 2,000 mg/l. On av­er­age, peo­ple lose around 900 mg/l.</p>
    <p>To avoid cramp, you need to sup­ple­ment with sodium as you race.</p>
    <p>I rec­om­mend aim­ing for the av­er­age of 900 mg/l, which is roughly four salt pills per litre of wa­ter you drink dur­ing the race.</p>
