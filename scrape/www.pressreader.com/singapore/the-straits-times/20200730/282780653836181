    <p>MUM­BAI • Bol­ly­wood su­per­star Amitabh Bachchan (left) has threat­ened to un­leash his le­gion of fans on on­line trolls wish­ing him death from the coron­avirus, af­ter ear­lier speak­ing out about the stigma suf­fered by pa­tients.</p>
    <p>Bachchan and his ac­tor son Ab­hishek have been in a Mum­bai hos­pi­tal for more than two weeks with Covid-19, while his ac­tress daugh­ter-in-law Aish­warya Rai and grand­daugh­ter Aarad­hya were dis­charged on Mon­day.</p>
    <p>They are the high­est-pro­file fam­ily to con­tract the virus in In­dia, the world’s third most i nfected na­tion with al­most 1.5 mil­lion cases.</p>
    <p>The 77-year-old and his 44-yearold son are in an iso­la­tion ward, with the el­derly ac­tor dis­pens­ing reg­u­lar mes­sages to his mil­lions of fans on Twit­ter, Instagram and Tum­blr.</p>
    <p>The megas­tar’s mes­sages usu­ally fo­cus on thank­ing fans and med­i­cal staff, but in a blog post pub­lished on Tues­day, he wrote that some peo­ple had sent him vi­cious hate mail, pray­ing for his death.</p>
    <p>In re­sponse, he vowed to “ex­ter­mi­nate” such trolls once out of hos­pi­tal, by ask­ing his mil­lions of fans to turn on them.</p>
    <p>De­scrib­ing his fans as his kin, he wrote: “That ex­tended fam­ily shall in the flash of an eye be­come ‘ex­ter­mi­na­tion fam­ily’.”</p>
    <p>Bachchan also revealed that he was able to hug his eight-year-old grand­daugh­ter be­fore she left the hos­pi­tal, re­count­ing his emo­tional re­ac­tion to the news that she and her mother could go home.</p>
    <p>“The tears flow out... the lit­tle one em­braces and tells me not to cry ... ‘You’ll be home soon’ she as­sures... I must be­lieve her,” he wrote.</p>
    <p>A blog en­try posted last Satur­day touched on the men­tal trauma and stigma suf­fered by Covid-19 pa­tients.</p>
    <p>Bachchan, idolised in In­dia, has worked for more than half a cen­tury in the film in­dus­try.</p>
    <p>In­dia’s film and fi­nan­cial cap­i­tal Mum­bai ac­counts for more than 7 per cent of all cases in the na­tion of 1.3 bil­lion peo­ple.</p>
    <p>The South Asian coun­try has lifted most lock­down re­stric­tions to restart the strug­gling econ­omy. But nu­mer­ous states have had to rein­tro­duce shut­downs amid spikes in in­fec­tions.</p>
    <p>Late Tues­day, the au­thor­i­ties of West Ben­gal, home to about 90 mil­lion peo­ple, ex­tended its lock­down – im­posed two days each week – to the end of next month.</p>
