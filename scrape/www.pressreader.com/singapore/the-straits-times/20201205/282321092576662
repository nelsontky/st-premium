    <p>M1 users around Sin­ga­pore were hit by a fi­bre broad­band out­age yes­ter­day that lasted more than four hours for some, the third such dis­rup­tion to the telco’s ser­vices this year. Fixed voice ser­vices were also af­fected.</p>
    <p>The out­age was first re­ported by M1 on its Face­book page at 6.40pm, although com­ments from af­fected users in ar­eas such as</p>
    <p>Wood­lands, Pung­gol and Jurong West be­gan to sur­face about an hour ear­lier. The telco said in an up­date at 10pm that all af­fected ser­vices had been fully re­stored.</p>
    <p>Its post had drawn more than 6,400 com­ments by then.</p>
    <p>“M1 users af­fected by this dis­rup­tion will be of­fered a one-time waiver on their ex­cess mo­bile data us­age in their next M1 bill,” said the telco, which apol­o­gised for the in­con­ve­nience caused.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to the Down­de­tec­tor web­site, which logs In­ter­net out­ages, M1 started hav­ing prob­lems at around 5.50pm, be­fore com­plaints spiked at 6.45pm, with around 9,800 re­ports.</p>
    <p>M1 said its fi­bre and fixed voice ser­vices were dis­rupted at 6.30pm, af­fect­ing users in some parts of Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>Sem­bawang res­i­dent Khairul An­war Say­ali, 34, said his broad­band con­nec­tion went down at 6.15pm when he was watch­ing Net­flix. It was re­stored about two hours later.</p>
    <p>“I wasn’t badly af­fected, but some of my friends were in Zoom meet­ings for work or do­ing as­sign­ments, and it might not have looked good for them to (lose their) con­nec­tions,” said Mr Khairul, who works in es­tate man­age­ment.</p>
    <p>“But no­body wants this to hap­pen, and I’m sure the en­gi­neers and ev­ery­one in­volved were try­ing their best to re­solve the is­sue.”</p>
    <p>Ta­man Jurong res­i­dent Petrus Tan, 59, was in the mid­dle of an on­line meet­ing at 6.15pm when his con­nec­tion was cut off.</p>
    <p>His smart home ap­pli­ances, such as an air pu­ri­fier and ro­bot vac­uum cleaner which are con­trolled by apps that re­quire a net­work con­nec­tion, also could not be op­er­ated.</p>
    <p>De­spite the hic­cup, Mr Tan, who works in man­u­fac­tur­ing, said he has no plans to switch tel­cos. “I have been us­ing M1 since 1997, and I will still stay with them as the price is cheaper. Singtel and StarHub have also had such in­ci­dents be­fore.”</p>
    <p>On so­cial plat­forms like Red­dit, some M1 users re­ported that their con­nec­tions were re­stored be­tween 7.15pm and 8pm.</p>
    <p>The lat­est in­ci­dent fol­lows two dis­rup­tions dur­ing Sin­ga­pore’s cir­cuit breaker pe­riod that lasted for al­most 30 hours col­lec­tively from May 12 to 13. The first was due to a cor­rupted pro­file data­base in the telco’s broad­band net­work gate­way, while the sec­ond was caused by a soft­ware fault that oc­curred in its net­work equip­ment.</p>
    <p>M1 was fined $400,000 by the In­fo­comm Me­dia De­vel­op­ment Au­thor­ity in Septem­ber for those ser­vice dis­rup­tions.</p>
