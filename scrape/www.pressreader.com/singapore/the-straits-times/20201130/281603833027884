    <p>Fi­nan­cial ad­viser Wil­son Tham had ar­ranged through a maid agency for a helper to ar­rive in May from the Philip­pines, a month be­fore his first child was due to be born.</p>
    <p>But the Covid-19 pan­demic made travel near im­pos­si­ble, said the 37-year-old.</p>
    <p>“She (the helper) couldn’t get to Manila be­cause of a lock­down, so we had no choice but to go without her,” said Mr Tham, who has been look­ing af­ter his daugh­ter with his wife, 28, also a fi­nan­cial ad­viser.</p>
    <p>The pan­demic has made it dif­fi­cult for fam­i­lies to hire new for­eign do­mes­tic work­ers (FDWs), and also lim­ited the num­ber of trans­fer maids avail­able.</p>
    <p>The travel restrictio­n is not the only is­sue.</p>
    <p>In an an­swer to a par­lia­men­tary question on Oct 6, Man­power Min­is­ter Josephine Teo said that dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker pe­riod, her min­istry ap­proved only 630 en­try re­quests for FDWs out of about 4,100 ap­proval ap­pli­ca­tions and ap­peals re­ceived.</p>
    <p>How­ever, re­stric­tions are grad­u­ally be­ing re­laxed.</p>
    <p>In a state­ment last Fri­day, the Min­istry of Man­power (MOM) said that with the safety mea­sures of pre-de­par­ture test­ing and re­quired stay-home no­tices (SHNs) on ar­rival for maids, it has “started in­creas­ing the num­ber of for­eign do­mes­tic work­ers en­ter­ing Sin­ga­pore”.</p>
    <p>But five maid agen­cies The Straits Times spoke to said there is a back­log.</p>
    <p>There are up to 20 po­ten­tial em­ploy­ers for each avail­able trans­fer maid – which refers to a helper al­ready em­ployed here who is seek­ing a new em­ployer. Be­fore the pan­demic, trans­fer maids were not pre­ferred be­cause many viewed them as po­ten­tially prob­lem­atic.</p>
    <p>Mr Chew Soon Chiah, man­ager of In­ter Great Em­ploy­ment, said: “Many em­ploy­ers are un­will­ing to let their maids go at the mo­ment as they are con­cerned they can­not find a new one, so it’s very hard to find a trans­fer helper.”</p>
    <p>Ask­ing salaries for trans­fer maids have risen from an av­er­age of $600 to $650 a month to $700 to $750, even reach­ing highs of $900 for ex­pe­ri­enced maids, said em­ploy­ment agen­cies.</p>
    <p>Some agents said the cur­rent pol­icy of re­quir­ing em­ploy­ers to con­sent be­fore maids can trans­fer is an­other rea­son for the drought.</p>
    <p>“If the em­ployer does not con­sent, even if (the maid) wants to trans­fer, she can’t,” said Uni­ver­sal Em­ploy­ment Agency man­ag­ing di­rec­tor El­iz­a­beth Leong.</p>
    <p>“Some em­ploy­ers refuse to al­low their helpers to trans­fer for emo­tional rea­sons; they feel be­trayed that she would want to work for some­one else – this is a prob­lem.”</p>
    <p>Em­ploy­ers at­tempt­ing to get new helpers have been plagued by de­lays and higher costs.</p>
    <p>Op­er­a­tions man­ager Caleb Tan has been wait­ing for his fam­ily’s new helper to ar­rive from the Philip­pines since early last month.</p>
    <p>“Her en­try has been ap­proved but be­cause of travel con­di­tions, she will only be here in early Jan­uary,” said the 48-year-old.</p>
    <p>A com­bi­na­tion of a typhoon in the Philip­pines and bu­reau­cratic de­lays, such as hav­ing to com­plete pre-de­par­ture cour­ses, has led to mul­ti­ple de­lays in her flight here.</p>
    <p>Mr Tan added that em­ploy­ment agency fees have in­creased – by $70 at one agency, and by $200 at an­other that he had ap­proached.</p>
    <p>Em­ploy­ers also have to foot the bill for the com­pul­sory SHN and Covid-19 tests for the maids when they ar­rive in Sin­ga­pore. This can add up to $1,700.</p>
    <p>Maid Av­enue gen­eral man­ager Wil­liam Lau, 39, said: “The process of bring­ing in a helper, which used to take less than a month, can now take up to three months.”</p>
    <p>He also cited var­i­ous new ad­min­is­tra­tive pro­ce­dures re­quired to bring in a new maid. Since March, em­ploy­ers or agen­cies now have to ap­ply for en­try ap­proval from MOM, in ad­di­tion to a work per­mit for their helper.</p>
    <p>From Jan 1 next year, em­ploy­ers will also have to foot the med­i­cal bill in the event that their re­turn­ing helper tests pos­i­tive for Covid-19. This is al­ready the case for new helpers.</p>
    <p>For Mr Tham, it means he and his wife have to be self-re­liant, although his mother-in-law helps out from Monday to Wednesday.</p>
    <p>He said: “It has been a bless­ing to be able to spend more time with my kid, but we def­i­nitely still want a helper in the fu­ture.”</p>
