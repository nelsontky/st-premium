    <p>KEEP­ING HOPE ALIVE</p>
    <p>With so­cial me­dia to­day, light can be shed on cold cases, which can help fam­i­lies with clo­sure, no mat­ter what the out­come. It can give the fam­ily a tiny bit of hope. ’’</p>
    <p>CRIME LI­BRARY SIN­GA­PORE FOUNDER JOSEPH TAN</p>
    <p>When a miss­ing per­son case makes head­lines, peo­ple of­ten darken Madam Tay Mee Na’s door.</p>
    <p>They try to per­suade the 80-year-old to talk about her son’s dis­ap­pear­ance 34 years ago.</p>
    <p>But Madam Tay, whose son Keh Chin Ann, known widely as one of the McDonald’s Boys, who went miss­ing with class­mate Toh Hong Huat in 1986, in­sists that her son’s case is unique.</p>
    <p>“The cases are very dif­fer­ent... (My son’s) case was very long ago,” the pe­tite Madam Tay cuts in, with­out need­ing much elab­o­ra­tion on the re­cent de­vel­op­ments on Ms Feli­cia Teo, clas­si­fied as miss­ing for 13 years be­fore two men were ac­cused of her murder ear­lier this month.</p>
    <p>Speak­ing from her home in a cen­tral part of Sin­ga­pore, Madam Tay added that her mem­ory is not what it used to be and she did not wish to talk about her son.</p>
    <p>She also told The Sunday Times that her hus­band, Mr Keh Chin Poh, died a few years ago.</p>
    <p>On Dec 17, Ah­mad Da­nial Mo­hamed Rafa’ee, 35, was charged with mur­der­ing Ms Teo, 19, at a Marine Ter­race flat. He is said to have com­mit­ted the of­fence in the early hours of June 30, 2007, with Ragil Pu­tra Se­tia Suk­marah­jana, 32, who is still at large.</p>
    <p>While new ev­i­dence helped in­ves­ti­ga­tors shed light on Ms Teo’s case, the dis­ap­pear­ance of Chin Ann and Hong Huat, who would have been 46 this year, re­mains one of the most baf­fling un­solved miss­ing per­son cases.</p>
    <p>MYS­TE­RI­OUS CASE OF THE MCDONALD’S BOYS</p>
    <p>The two Pri­mary 6 boys from Owen Pri­mary school went miss­ing on May 14, 1986. The pair have since been legally declared dead.</p>
    <p>The case got its moniker af­ter the fast-food gi­ant put out a $100,000 re­ward for any in­for­ma­tion on the boys’ dis­ap­pear­ance. The de­ci­sion was re­port­edly a spon­ta­neous one in­flu­enced by McDonald’s strong ties with chil­dren, as well as to re­new in­ter­est in the case months af­ter the boys went miss­ing.</p>
    <p>One neigh­bour said that af­ter Chin Ann’s dis­ap­pear­ance, Madam Tay would spend the day at her old ad­dress in case her son came back.</p>
    <p>“They moved here just af­ter the son went miss­ing, so for a few years she would go back to the old house a lot to wait for him or for any news,” said the neigh­bour, who de­clined to be named.</p>
    <p>An­other neigh­bour said Madam Tay hardly ever smiled. “Ev­ery time she would sit at the void deck look­ing at other kids play­ing... For more than 10 or 20 years, she never smiled. Only more re­cently she can open up and smile at us,” he said.</p>
    <p>NO LUCK ACROSS THE CAUSEWAY</p>
    <p>Datuk Seri Michael Chong prides him­self on hav­ing a 70 per cent suc­cess rate when it comes to lo­cat­ing miss­ing per­sons.</p>
    <p>But Mr Chong, who helms the Malaysian Chi­nese As­so­ci­a­tion’s (MCA) Pub­lic Ser­vices and Com­plaints De­part­ment, can­not for­get a hand­ful of cold cases, in­clud­ing the McDonald’s Boys’, even though it oc­curred more than three decades ago.</p>
    <p>Mr Chong, 72, still re­calls the day in 1990 when he was vis­ited by Madam Tan Geok Kuan, the mother of Hong Huat.</p>
    <p>“She was dif­fer­ent, she wasn’t cry­ing or look­ing anx­ious,” he told The Sunday Times in a tele­phone in­ter­view. “She looked as if she had cried enough and was re­signed to fate that her only son may never be found. She was pre­pared for the worst.”</p>
    <p>Madam Tan is Malaysian and had gone to his of­fice at the MCA head­quar­ters in Jalan Am­pang, Kuala Lumpur.</p>
    <p>Mr Chong re­called that Madam Tan, who was alone, brought pho­to­graphs of Hong Huat, as well as miss­ing per­sons posters and an ad­ver­tise­ment for the $100,000 re­ward by McDonald’s.</p>
    <p>“I’m gen­er­ally con­fi­dent of re­ceiv­ing tip-offs from the pub­lic once a miss­ing per­son case has been pub­li­cised,” he said. “De­spite the McDonald’s Boys case be­ing ma­jor news that’s been widely re­ported, to this day I have not re­ceived any in­for­ma­tion from the pub­lic. Not even prank calls.”</p>
    <p>On a few oc­ca­sions, Madam Tan</p>
    <p>checked with him for up­dates about her son. But later, she stopped call­ing.</p>
    <p>NO STONE UNTURNED</p>
    <p>The po­lice said they re­ceived 1,968 miss­ing per­son re­ports last year, slightly higher than the 1,808 cases in 2018 and 1,841 in 2017. This works out to about five cases a day.</p>
    <p>While they did not say how many of these cases have been solved, for­mer po­lice of­fi­cers said a large ma­jor­ity of those re­ported lost are found.</p>
    <p>The po­lice said in­ves­ti­ga­tions in­clude in­ter­views, check­ing with agen­cies such as the Im­mi­gra­tion and Check­points Au­thor­ity and hos­pi­tals. They also use closed-cir­cuit tele­vi­sion footage and ap­peal for in­for­ma­tion through so­cial and main­stream me­dia.</p>
    <p>A gazette is is­sued for of­fi­cers on the ground to look out for the miss­ing per­son and it re­mains in force un­til the per­son is found.</p>
    <p>For cold cases, the po­lice said they reg­u­larly re­view miss­ing per­son re­ports. “A case may be re­ferred to the Crim­i­nal In­ves­ti­ga­tion De­part­ment (CID) as part of a process where se­lected cases which have been out­stand­ing for a pro­tracted pe­riod of time are sur­faced to CID for a fresh re­view,” the po­lice said.</p>
    <p>When a loved one is re­ported miss­ing, John (not his real name), a for­mer se­nior po­lice of­fi­cer, would work with his col­leagues as if the miss­ing per­son was his fam­ily mem­ber. “As a fa­ther, I worry about young chil­dren who go miss­ing,” said John, who is in his 50s and served more than 30 years in the po­lice force.</p>
    <p>“We have to move quickly be­cause chil­dren are more vul­ner­a­ble to negative in­flu­ences or peo­ple with bad in­ten­tions.”</p>
    <p>Oth­ers who go miss­ing in­clude for­eign work­ers and do­mes­tic helpers, chil­dren in cus­tody bat­tles, spouses, the el­derly and way­ward youth.</p>
    <p>Some­times, the per­son who is be­ing sought by the po­lice can­not re­ally be clas­si­fied as miss­ing, said John, who has not en­coun­tered a cold case dur­ing his watch.</p>
    <p>“It was not un­com­mon for us to lo­cate a per­son re­ported miss­ing within a day of the report be­ing made,” he said. “We would leave a mes­sage on the miss­ing per­son’s mo­bile phone and he would call us back al­most im­me­di­ately be­cause he would be shocked to see a mes­sage from the po­lice.”</p>
    <p>More of­ten than not, the “miss­ing per­son” would have de­cided to leave home with­out in­form­ing his par­ents.</p>
    <p>With mod­ern tech­nol­ogy, the work of find­ing miss­ing per­sons has be­come eas­ier.</p>
    <p>Po­lice cam­eras at Hous­ing Board lift lob­bies, mo­bile phones and so­cial me­dia are ex­ploited to lo­cate a per­son.</p>
    <p>“But it still boils down to po­lice of­fi­cers go­ing to the ground to speak to wit­nesses and join­ing the dots, es­pe­cially when the trail ends with­out a trace,” John said. “This is the heart of po­lice work.”</p>
    <p>NOT ALL WHO GO MISS­ING ARE LOST</p>
    <p>Sev­eral years ago, John’s team en­coun­tered a case of a young man who was re­ported miss­ing. It was dis­cov­ered the per­son had vol­un­tar­ily left Sin­ga­pore and flown to a Euro­pean coun­try. Checks with the po­lice there con­firmed the man had ar­rived in that coun­try. It was be­lieved he had left Sin­ga­pore to join a for­eign army.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to John, miss­ing per­sons’ cases are re­viewed once ev­ery few months. “While un­solved cases are very rare, what’s more com­mon are cases of peo­ple who ha­bit­u­ally go ‘miss­ing’,” he said.</p>
    <p>“They dis­ap­pear and are later found but choose to run away again from their homes.”</p>
    <p>On very rare oc­ca­sions, run­aways have re­united with their fam­i­lies years later, said Crime Li­brary Sin­ga­pore founder Joseph Tan. He cited Por­tu­gal-based singer-song­writer Shaik Salwa Shaik Hanif, now 25, as an ex­am­ple.</p>
    <p>She was just 11 years old when she ran away from home, but reached out to her fam­ily eight years later when she was 19, ac­cord­ing to an on­line pro­file.</p>
    <p>Mr Tan, whose or­gan­i­sa­tion helps fam­i­lies search for their miss­ing loved ones, called this case a “one in a hun­dred”.</p>
    <p>He told The Sunday Times: “With so­cial me­dia to­day, light can be shed on cold cases, which can help fam­i­lies with clo­sure, no mat­ter what the out­come.”</p>
    <p>He added: “It can give the fam­ily a tiny bit of hope.”</p>
