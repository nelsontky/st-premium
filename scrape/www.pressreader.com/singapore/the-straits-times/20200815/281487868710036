    <p>Ex­pect wet­ter weather in the sec­ond half of this month, said the weath­er­man yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Thun­dery showers are ex­pected on most days over the next two weeks be­tween late morn­ing and af­ter­noon, and could also oc­cur on a few nights, ac­cord­ing to the National En­vi­ron­ment Agency’s Me­te­o­ro­log­i­cal Ser­vice Sin­ga­pore (MSS).</p>
    <p>In ad­di­tion, wide­spread thun­dery showers with gusty winds could sweep through Sin­ga­pore on one or two morn­ings.</p>
    <p>The MSS said this is due to the pas­sage of Su­ma­tra squalls, which are lines of thun­der­storms that usu­ally de­velop at night over Su­ma­tra or the Strait of Malacca. They typ­i­cally move east to­wards Sin­ga­pore in the early morn­ing hours.</p>
    <p>While more rain­fall is ex­pected in the sec­ond half of Au­gust than in the first, to­tal rain­fall for the month is fore­cast to be near av­er­age over most parts of the is­land.</p>
    <p>The wet­ter weather could pro­vide brief respite from the heat in the days ahead. Tem­per­a­tures on most days in the lat­ter half of Au­gust should range be­tween 25 deg C and 33 deg C, with highs of around 34 deg C on a few par­tic­u­larly warm days.</p>
    <p>A few warm and hu­mid nights are also fore­cast, with tem­per­a­tures hov­er­ing at about 28 deg C.</p>
    <p>In com­par­i­son, for the first half of the month, the high­est daily max­i­mum tem­per­a­ture recorded was the past Sun­day’s 35.4 deg C, while the daily max­i­mum was above 33 deg C on most days.</p>
    <p>On a few nights, the daily min­i­mum tem­per­a­ture over the south­ern, east­ern and western coastal ar­eas of the is­land was above 28 deg C.</p>
    <p>Drier weather was also ex­pe­ri­enced in the first half of Au­gust as the mon­soon rain band was sit­u­ated over north­ern South-east Asia, re­sult­ing in drier weather over equa­to­rial South-east Asia, in­clud­ing Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>Many ar­eas re­ceived well be­low av­er­age rain­fall, with that in Sen­tosa is­land, in par­tic­u­lar, falling 84 per cent be­low the av­er­age.</p>
    <p>There were, how­ever, a few days when Sin­ga­pore saw thun­dery showers due to the pas­sage of the Su­ma­tra squalls.</p>
    <p>National wa­ter agency PUB said heavy rain yes­ter­day morn­ing caused brief flash floods at the junction of Craig Road and Tan­jong Pa­gar Road, which sub­sided after 10 min­utes.</p>
    <p>On Thurs­day, PUB said a heavy down­pour re­sulted in ac­cu­mu­lated wa­ter in Alju­nied Road, be­low the Pan-Is­land Ex­press­way fly­over, at around 7am.</p>
    <p>The day’s high­est daily to­tal rain­fall of 115.6mm was recorded in Be­dok South.</p>
    <p>While more rain­fall is ex­pected in the sec­ond half of Au­gust than in the first, to­tal rain­fall for the month is fore­cast to be near av­er­age over most parts of the is­land.</p>
