    <p>Fam­ily care­givers face dif­fi­culty jug­gling care­giv­ing re­spon­si­bil­i­ties with paid work, due to the high de­mands of both (Good time to look at leg­is­lat­ing par­ent-care leave, Nov 18). Un­sur­pris­ingly, many are forced to quit their jobs or re­duce their work­ing hours to cope with care­giv­ing du­ties.</p>
    <p>This was the case for about 67 per cent of the re­spon­dents in the As­so­ci­a­tion of Women for Ac­tion and Re­search’s (Aware) 2019 re­search on the con­flict be­tween care­giv­ing and work for fe­male care­givers to the el­derly.</p>
    <p>Even for those who em­ploy mi­grant do­mes­tic work­ers to help, Aware’s re­search shows that fam­ily care­givers are still pri­mar­ily re­spon­si­ble for care­giv­ing tasks. These in­clude care nav­i­ga­tion, ar­rang­ing for med­i­cal ap­point­ments, speak­ing to care pro­fes­sion­als and man­ag­ing care costs.</p>
    <p>While fam­ily care­givers who are work­ing can take time off for care­giv­ing, such leave tends to be un­paid, and is an in­suf­fi­cient so­lu­tion. Last year, only one in five em­ploy­ers of­fered paid fam­ily care leave.</p>
    <p>In Aware’s re­search, care­givers ex­pressed a fear of be­ing pe­nalised or dis­missed from their jobs be­cause too much time off may make them seem less com­mit­ted to work. Since care­giv­ing leave is mostly un­paid, those who do take it ex­pe­ri­ence a sig­nif­i­cant loss in in­come.</p>
    <p>Ad­di­tion­ally, el­i­gi­bil­ity for care­giv­ing leave – at least for those in com­pa­nies that fol­low the Tri­par­tite Stan­dard on Un­paid Leave for Un­ex­pected Care Needs – is lim­ited to cases where care­giv­ing re­cip­i­ents are hos­pi­talised. But many care­givers tend to those who suf­fer from chronic ill­nesses (which can sud­denly flare up), and those un­able to per­form ac­tiv­i­ties of daily liv­ing. Care­givers are, thus, of­ten forced to use their an­nual leave and forgo time off for them­selves.</p>
    <p>The call to re­view and po­ten­tially leg­is­late par­ent-care leave for all is the right step for­ward, es­pe­cially in view of Sin­ga­pore’s age­ing pop­u­la­tion and grow­ing work­force. We should leg­is­late six days of paid el­der­care leave, like the six days of child­care leave cur­rently avail­able. (Work­ers car­ing for both chil­dren and the el­derly would there­fore re­ceive 12 days of paid leave.)</p>
    <p>Paid care leave should be avail­able to all work­ers and should be ex­tended to all pri­mary fam­ily care­givers re­gard­less of their re­la­tion­ship to the care re­cip­i­ent. How­ever, to keep busi­ness costs low for em­ploy­ers, the leave could be re­stricted to those liv­ing with their care re­cip­i­ents.</p>
    <p>Fam­ily care­givers should be given the right amount of sup­port in thanks for their ded­i­ca­tion to their fam­ily and the labour force. Jas­mine Gomez Project Con­sul­tant</p>
