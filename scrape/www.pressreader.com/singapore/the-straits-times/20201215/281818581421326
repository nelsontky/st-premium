    <p>WASH­ING­TON A bi­par­ti­san group of law­mak­ers is ready­ing a two-part pro­posal with US$908 bil­lion (S$1.2 tril­lion) in pan­demic re­lief to help boost the bat­tered US econ­omy.</p>
    <p>They are plan­ning to re­lease it soon so it can be con­sid­ered by con­gres­sional lead­ers ne­go­ti­at­ing a fi­nal pack­age that can be in­cluded in a gov­ern­ment spend­ing Bill needed by Dec 18.</p>
    <p>House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Trea­sury Sec­re­tary Steven Mnuchin spoke by phone on Sun­day and were plan­ning to speak again yesterday. The two have re­mained op­ti­mistic de­spite months of fruit­less dis­cus­sions.</p>
    <p>Se­nate Ma­jor­ity Leader Mitch McCon­nell has sug­gested that Congress move for­ward with a Bill that does not in­clude the two most con­tro­ver­sial pro­vi­sions: li­a­bil­ity pro­tec­tion for em­ploy­ers from virus­re­lated law­suits and US$160 bil­lion in aid for state and lo­cal govern­ments.</p>
    <p>“We’ll have a Bill pro­duced for the Amer­i­can peo­ple (on Mon­day),” Sen­a­tor Joe Manchin said on Fox News Sun­day.</p>
    <p>The group worked through the week­end to re­solve the dif­fer­ences on th­ese two pro­vi­sions, which have stymied a deal for months.</p>
    <p>The next step for the leg­is­la­tion will be for Repub­li­can and Demo­cratic lead­ers to fin­ish ne­go­ti­at­ing the fi­nal pack­age that could get a vote.</p>
    <p>While Democrats have en­dorsed the bi­par­ti­san plan as a ba­sis for ne­go­ti­a­tions, it is un­clear whether Mr McCon­nell would put it on the Se­nate floor for a vote.</p>
    <p>Mr McCon­nell favours Mr</p>
    <p>Mnuchin’s US$916 bil­lion re­lief pro­posal, which in­cludes US$600 in di­rect pay­ments to in­di­vid­u­als but does not have the US$300 per week sup­ple­men­tal un­em­ploy­ment in­surance in­cluded in the bi­par­ti­san Bill.</p>
    <p>Law­mak­ers of both par­ties have said that the best chance for pass­ing a pan­demic-re­lief Bill this month would be to at­tach it to the 12-Bill om­nibus pack­age Congress must pass by Fri­day to fund the gov­ern­ment.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump has re­peated his threat to veto a mas­sive de­fence spend­ing Bill, set­ting the stage for a ma­jor bat­tle with US law­mak­ers at a time when they are rac­ing to ham­mer out a com­pro­mise on more coro­n­avirus re­lief.</p>
    <p>The US$740 bil­lion Na­tional De­fence Au­tho­ri­sa­tion Act passed both Houses of Congress with more than the two-thirds ma­jor­ity needed to over­ride a pres­i­den­tial veto.</p>
    <p>Pas­sage by the Repub­li­can-con­trolled US Se­nate last Fri­day sent the mea­sure to Mr Trump, giv­ing him 10 days – mi­nus Sun­days – to veto it, sign it or al­low it to be­come law with­out his sig­na­ture.</p>
