    <p>Sin­ga­pore­ans have mainly been cash­ing in their $100 Sin­gapoRedis­cover st our ism vouch­ers on ho­tel stay­ca­tions and tick­ets to lo­cal at­trac­tions since the scheme be­gan last Tues­day.</p>
    <p>Book­ing plat­forms told The Straits Times that they are see­ing a healthy up­take across the board, in par­tic­u­lar for vis­i­tor mag­nets like Gar­dens by the Bay and Universal Stu­dios Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>There were plenty of peo­ple out and about yes­ter­day to make use of their vouch­ers at Gar­dens by the Bay, Ma­rina Bay Sands SkyPark and pop­u­lar spots on Sen­tosa is­land.</p>
    <p>Stu­dent Kylie Chia, 22, and her boyfriend vis­ited Gar­dens by the Bay and had only a “lit­tle bit of a wait” to en­ter the Flower Dome, which was not crowded.</p>
    <p>“I was ex­pect­ing a huge week­end crowd here but I was pleas­antly sur­prised to still have loads of space to walk around and take photos. How­ever, I will try to use the rest of my</p>
    <p>vouch­ers on a week­day in Jan­uary in­stead, af­ter the school hol­i­days are over,” Ms Chia said.</p>
    <p>She bought a $20 ticket from Klook for Gar­dens by the Bay, which gave her ac­cess to the Flower Dome, Cloud For­est and the Christ­mas Won­der­land.</p>
    <p>En­gi­neer Ted Chi­ang, 39, and wife El­iza, 36, who runs a small busi­ness, went to book­ing plat­form Glob­alTix to snag tick­ets for the SkyPark Ob­ser­va­tion Deck at Ma­rina Bay Sands.</p>
    <p>“Us­ing the tourism vouch­ers was a great op­tion – the tick­ets came up to $20 per head... Rather than be­ing cooped up at home we de­cided to go out on a date, spend some time to­gether and see the sights,” Mr Chi­ang said.</p>
    <p>There were many peo­ple flock­ing to Sen­tosa is­land, where Universal Stu­dios Sin­ga­pore and the S.E.A Aquar­ium are lo­cated.</p>
    <p>Mr Lim Yew Li, 52, who works in con­struc­tion, man­aged to snag combo tick­ets on Trip.com to visit both at­trac­tions with his wife and univer­sity-go­ing daugh­ter.</p>
    <p>“The pack­age cost us just un­der $100 per per­son, so it’s re­ally a free visit to these lo­ca­tions. We have been plan­ning to visit Universal Stu­dios for years but just hadn’t found a good rea­son to un­til now,” Mr Lim said, adding that the pack­age he bought ap­peared sold out now.</p>
    <p>Ms Pallavi Ba­jaj, 33, said get­ting tick­ets to visit the S.E.A. Aquar­ium with her hus­band Ar­jun Ba­jaj, 39, and her two-year-old daugh­ter was a “treat”. The cou­ple, who bought $35 tick­ets on Glob­alTix, plan to visit the Sin­ga­pore Zoo next.</p>
    <p>“We were a lit­tle ner­vous about week­end crowds for sure, and it be­ing the school hol­i­days, a lit­tle jostling is to be ex­pected. But we re­ally can’t com­plain since we’re pretty much get­ting an aquar­ium visit for free,” Ms Ba­jaj, who is cur­rently un­em­ployed, said.</p>
    <p>The Sin­ga­pore Tourism Board said last Tues­day that the ap­pointed book­ing plat­forms – Changi Rec­om­mends, Glob­alTix, Trav­eloka, Trip.com and Klook – had re­ceived more than 11,900 book­ings to­talling about $1.86 mil­lion in vouch­ers and pay­ments as at 4.30pm that day, leav­ing some of­fer­ings sold out by mid­day.</p>
    <p>“There are many early adopters and the take-up rate is very en­cour­ag­ing,” said Ms Carine Chew, head of out­bound prod­ucts at Changi</p>
    <p>Rec­om­mends. She added that the most-booked at­trac­tions in­cluded Gar­dens by the Bay, Universal Stu­dios Sin­ga­pore and the Sin­ga­pore Zoo.</p>
    <p>“We have seen healthy de­mand across all sec­tors, and ex­clu­sive deals are per­form­ing bet­ter.”</p>
    <p>Mr Reza Amirul Ju­niar­shah, head of cor­po­rate com­mu­ni­ca­tions at Trav­eloka, said traf­fic on the plat­form has surged around 15-fold over nor­mal pe­ri­ods since the vouch­ers were launched last Tues­day. “With fam­i­lies and cou­ples long­ing for ex­pe­ri­ences and ex­plo­ration of the city, at­trac­tions and hid­den gem tours have been pop­u­lar,” he added.</p>
    <p>Klook has also seen a “strong show­ing” from voucher users, said South-east Asia mar­ket­ing direc­tor Sarah Wan.</p>
    <p>“We have seen quite an even spread of book­ing across ho­tels, at­trac­tions and tours. In­ter­est­ingly, we’ve also seen good trac­tion for smaller tour op­er­a­tors such as City Tours, which runs the Cap­tain Ex­plorer DUKW Tour, and Tribe Tours, which runs the Chinatown Mur­ders Game Tour and Sin­ga­pore’s Dis­ap­pear­ing Trade Tour,” Ms Wan noted.</p>
