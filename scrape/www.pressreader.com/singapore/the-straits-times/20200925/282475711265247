    <p>WASH­ING­TON • In 2014, United States Supreme Court Jus­tice Ruth Bader Gins­burg, the pi­o­neer­ing le­gal mind and ad­vo­cate for equal treat­ment of the sexes who died at 87 last Fri­day, did some­thing that prob­a­bly none of her male col­leagues were ever asked to do: She gave a tour of her of­fice closet.</p>
    <p>The oc­ca­sion was an in­ter­view with broad­cast jour­nal­ist Katie Couric af­ter Jus­tice Gins­burg’s strongly worded, 35-page dis­sent in the Bur­well v Hobby Lobby de­ci­sion, in which the court sided with a cor­po­ra­tion’s de­sire to chal­lenge the Af­ford­able Care Act’s con­tra­cep­tion man­date on the grounds of reli­gious free­dom.</p>
    <p>But Jus­tice Gins­burg did not seem re­motely put out about start­ing the con­ver­sa­tion with fash­ion.</p>
    <p>Open­ing the i mpos­ing wood doors of her wardrobe, she re­vealed, on one side, the long black robes of the court, and on the other – tak­ing up more than half the hanger space – her ex­ten­sive col­lec­tion of elab­o­rate col­lars.</p>
    <p>She had them, she said, “from all over the world”. She had them for ev­ery oc­ca­sion and for ev­ery kind of opin­ion of the court.</p>
    <p>As much as the nick­name “The No­to­ri­ous R.B.G.”, which came to sym­bol­ise Jus­tice Gins­burg’s sta­tus as a pop cul­ture hero in her later years, the col­lars served as both semi­ol­ogy and semaphore: They sig­nalled her po­si­tions be­fore she even opened her mouth and they rep­re­sented her unique role as the sec­ond woman on Amer­ica’s high­est court.</p>
    <p>Shin­ing like a bea­con amid the dark sea of de­na­tur­ing ju­di­cial robes, Jus­tice Gins­burg’s col­lars were un­mis­tak­able in pho­to­graphs and from the court floor.</p>
    <p>Though ob­vi­ously, Jus­tice Gins­burg’s legacy of ju­rispru­dence is her most im­por­tant gift to his­tory, her un­der­stand­ing of her own sig­nif­i­cance as a role model was un­de­ni­able.</p>
    <p>As the rare fe­male law stu­dent (and stu­dent in the rar­efied air at the top of the class) – not to men­tion the rare fe­male lawyer – she was used to be­ing the only one.</p>
    <p>She knew that ev­ery state­ment she made, ev­ery ges­ture, ev­ery image would be noted, picked over and parsed. All her choices mat­tered. So she might as well im­bue them with mean­ing.</p>
    <p>Even if they were only about the col­lar.</p>
    <p>In 2009, in an in­ter­view with The Wash­ing­ton Post, she ex­plained how her col­lec­tion orig­i­nated: “You know, the stan­dard robe is made for a man be­cause it has a place for the shirt to show and the tie,” Jus­tice Gins­burg told the paper.</p>
    <p>So she and Jus­tice San­dra Day O’Connor, the first fe­male jus­tice on the court, “thought it would be ap­pro­pri­ate if we in­cluded as part of our robe some­thing typ­i­cal of a woman”.</p>
    <p>They were not go­ing to ob­scure their sex or pre­tend it was be­side the point. It was part of the point.</p>
    <p>She wore her ma­jor­ity opin­ion col­lar, a beige and egg yolk yel­low cro­cheted style sus­pended from a gold chain, with beaded drops at the hem, that was a gift from her law clerks, when speak­ing for the ma­jor­ity of the court.</p>
    <p>Her dis­sent col­lar, a spiky be­jew­elled neck­lace on a black band from Ba­nana Repub­lic that had been gifted to her when she was named a Glam­our Woman of the Year in 2012, she wore when she read her equally spiky dis­sents from the bench.</p>
    <p>She also wore it the day af­ter the 2016 US pres­i­den­tial elec­tion, which no one thought was a co­in­ci­dence; the dis­sent col­lar be­came so fa­mous on its own that it was memo­ri­alised in jewellery, mag­nets and tem­po­rary tat­toos.</p>
    <p>Her crisp white jabot edged in black (from the gift shop of the Metropoli­tan Opera), which was a replica of a sim­i­lar jabot worn by a char­ac­ter in a Verdi opera she had at­tended, she wore when she re­ceived her hon­orary law de­gree at Har­vard University in 2011 (along with Span­ish tenor Placido Domingo, who ser­e­naded her).</p>
    <p>And then there was her favourite: a del­i­cate white style from Capetown, South Africa.</p>
    <p>To pay at­ten­tion to what a pow­er­ful woman wears is of­ten dis­missed as a way to den­i­grate her. But not to pay at­ten­tion in this case is to dis­re­spect the at­ten­tion to de­tail that marked Jus­tice Gins­burg’s work in all its di­men­sions.</p>
    <p>Af­ter all, a gaunt­let may once have been a me­tal glove, but some­times, it can also be a lace col­lar. That does not make it any less ef­fec­tive at chal­leng­ing an an­ti­quated sta­tus quo.</p>
