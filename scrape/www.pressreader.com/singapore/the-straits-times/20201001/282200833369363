    <p>Sin­ga­pore’s as­set man­age­ment in­dus­try reg­is­tered a ro­bust ex­pan­sion last year, aided by a strong pipe­line of new man­agers and funds seek­ing in­vest­ment op­por­tu­ni­ties in the Asia-Pa­cific re­gion.</p>
    <p>As­sets su­per­vised by Sin­ga­pore­based man­agers grew by 15.7 per cent to reach a to­tal of about $4 tril­lion by the end of last year, ac­cord­ing to an an­nual sur­vey by the Mon­e­tary Author­ity of Sin­ga­pore (MAS) re­leased yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Last year’s jump in Sin­ga­pore’s as­sets un­der man­age­ment (AUM) fol­lowed a more mod­est 5.4 per cent rise in 2018 to $3.4 tril­lion.</p>
    <p>The num­ber of reg­is­tered and li­censed as­set man­agers also rose in tan­dem, with a net in­crease of 108 last year, bring­ing the to­tal to 895.</p>
    <p>Ce­ment­ing the Repub­lic’s po­si­tion as the Global-Asia Pa­cific gate­way, 76 per cent of the AUM orig­i­nated from out­side of Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>About 69 per cent of the to­tal AUM in Sin­ga­pore was in­vested into the Asia-Pa­cific re­gion.</p>
    <p>MAS said the re­gion was also a key source of as­set in­flow for the money man­agers here.</p>
    <p>Net in­flows from Asia-Pa­cific clients to Sin­ga­pore-based man­agers in­creased by 21 per cent last year, com­pared with a de­cline of 1 per cent in 2018.</p>
    <p>Funds al­ready in­vested in re­gional as­sets saw growth of 24 per cent, com­pared with a gain of just 1.3 per cent in 2018.</p>
    <p>Within the Asia-Pa­cific, South­east Asian coun­tries re­mained key in­vest­ment des­ti­na­tions, ac­count­ing for 37 per cent of the to­tal in­vested across the re­gion.</p>
    <p>IN­VEST­MENT FLOWS</p>
    <p>In­vest­ments by Sin­ga­pore-based as­set man­agers into eq­ui­ties and cor­po­rate bonds rose while safe haven as­sets – such as sov­er­eign, quasigov­ern­ment and supra bonds – fell in some re­gions and cash al­lo­ca­tions were down.</p>
    <p>The al­lo­ca­tion by Sin­ga­pore­based as­set man­agers into eq­ui­ties rose to 42 per cent of AUM last year, from 41 per cent in 2018.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, in­vest­ments into fixed in­come as­sets also in­creased, led by flows into cor­po­rate bonds, which ac­counted for 66 per cent of fixed in­come AUM last year.</p>
    <p>While tra­di­tional AUM – eq­ui­ties and fixed in­come – in­creased by a com­bined 25 per cent last year, Sin­ga­pore’s al­ter­na­tives sec­tor also con­tin­ued to ex­pand at a steady pace.</p>
    <p>Pri­vate eq­uity and ven­ture cap­i­tal firms posted strong growth of 14 per cent and 86 per cent re­spec­tively.</p>
    <p>NEW FRAME­WORK FOR FUNDS</p>
    <p>MAS said Sin­ga­pore is also fast be­com­ing an Asia-Pa­cific hub for as­set man­agers seek­ing to lo­cate their in­vest­ments and fund man­age­ment ac­tiv­i­ties in the same des­ti­na­tion through vari­able cap­i­tal com­pa­nies (VCC) – a new flex­i­ble cor­po­rate struc­ture de­signed for it.</p>
    <p>The cen­tral bank and the Ac­count­ing and Cor­po­rate Reg­u­la­tory Author­ity (Acra) launched the VCC frame­work on Jan 15.</p>
    <p>As at mid-last month, more than 120 VCCs have been in­cor­po­rated with Acra, it said.</p>
    <p>“The VCC has at­tracted di­verse in­ter­est from global and lo­cal as­set man­agers due to its flex­i­bil­ity, such as its abil­ity to be used as ei­ther a stand­alone fund or as an um­brella fund with mul­ti­ple sub­funds, across tra­di­tional and alternativ­e in­vest­ment ob­jec­tives,” MAS said.</p>
    <p>COVID-19 CHAL­LENGES</p>
    <p>Be­yond the new VCCs, 86 new as­set man­ager li­cences and reg­is­tra­tions were is­sued in the first three quar­ters of this year.</p>
    <p>“De­spite the on­go­ing Covid-19 pan­demic and lin­ger­ing un­cer­tainty on the full ex­tent of its im­pli­ca­tions on the as­set man­age­ment in­dus­try, Sin­ga­pore con­tin­ues to be an at­trac­tive place for busi­ness,” MAS said.</p>
    <p>MAS said it has been work­ing closely with Sin­ga­pore-based as­set man­agers to min­imise busi­ness dis­rup­tions as well as sup­port them in up­skilling and ven­tur­ing into new busi­ness streams.</p>
    <p>Th­ese ef­forts will en­sure that the in­dus­try is well-po­si­tioned to cap­i­talise on new op­por­tu­ni­ties as the econ­omy re­cov­ers, the cen­tral bank said.</p>
    <p>MAS said that en­vi­ron­men­tal, so­cial and gov­er­nance (ESG) con­sid­er­a­tions con­tinue to be at the fore­front of in­vestors’ and as­set man­agers’ minds.</p>
    <p>De­spite the damp­en­ing im­pact of Covid-19 on in­vest­ment sen­ti­ment, global net in­flows into sus­tain­able funds have in­creased this year.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore’s share of ESG man­aged as­sets stood at 28 per cent last year, com­pared with 27 per cent in 2018, the sur­vey found.</p>
