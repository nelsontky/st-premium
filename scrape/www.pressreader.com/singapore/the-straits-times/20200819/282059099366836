    <p>In an ef­fort to boost his cred­i­bil­ity in re­search pa­pers sub­mit­ted to med­i­cal jour­nals, a trainee doc­tor claimed his work was co-au­thored by two peo­ple, named Mark Pitts and Peter Le­mark, who turned out to be fic­ti­tious char­ac­ters.</p>
    <p>Dr Chua Shun­jie, 35, then a house­man, also falsely claimed that he was from the Na­tional Skin Cen­tre in an­other aca­demic paper and that he was with Sin­ga­pore Gen­eral Hos­pi­tal (SGH) in ap­pli­ca­tion forms.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, in an ap­peal to the Court of Three Judges, the Sin­ga­pore Med­i­cal Coun­cil (SMC) ar­gued that Dr Chua should be struck off the reg­is­ter.</p>
    <p>Apart from the bo­gus au­thor­ship and af­fil­i­a­tion claims, Dr Chua had also breached med­i­cal con­fi­den­tial­ity by dis­clos­ing a pa­tient’s con­di­tion with­out con­sent.</p>
    <p>SMC, rep­re­sented by Mr Kevin Ho and Ms Roseanne Tan, ar­gued that Dr Chua’s orig­i­nal pun­ish­ment of 18 months’ sus­pen­sion, meted out by a three-mem­ber dis­ci­plinary tri­bunal last year, was “man­i­festly in­ad­e­quate”.</p>
    <p>Mr Ho said there was “a pat­tern of mis­con­duct”, which showed Dr Chua was dis­hon­est and had in­tegrity is­sues. Dr Chua’s ac­tions can cause se­vere harm to the pub­lic’s con­fi­dence in doc­tors and Sin­ga­pore’s standing as a med­i­cal re­search hub, he added.</p>
    <p>His lawyers, Mr Ju­lian Tay and Ms Theodora Kee, said the house­man’s med­i­cal ca­reer was halted even be­fore it started but he has “paid his penance” and a strikingof­f would be a crush­ing sen­tence.</p>
    <p>Mr Tay also ques­tioned the le­gal ba­sis for the dis­ci­plinary pro­ceed­ings as Dr Chua’s pro­vi­sional regis­tra­tion as a med­i­cal prac­ti­tioner ex­pired in De­cem­ber 2016 and he has not prac­tised since then.</p>
    <p>The court re­served judg­ment and will give its de­ci­sion at a later date.</p>
    <p>Dr Chua grad­u­ated from DukeNUS Med­i­cal School in July 2015 and was granted pro­vi­sional regis­tra­tion to un­dergo his house­man­ship train­ing.</p>
    <p>Be­tween July and Oc­to­ber 2015, while he was a house­man at Na­tional Univer­sity Hos­pi­tal, he sub­mit­ted two re­search ap­pli­ca­tion forms in which he falsely stated that he was af­fil­i­ated with the SGH Der­ma­tol­ogy Depart­ment.</p>
    <p>In Au­gust 2015, he sub­mit­ted a paper to the Bri­tish Journal of Der­ma­tol­ogy, stat­ing that he was with the Na­tional Skin Cen­tre.</p>
    <p>Be­tween Au­gust and Septem­ber 2015, he sub­mit­ted two pa­pers with bo­gus co-au­thors to pro­fes­sional jour­nals.</p>
    <p>In April 2016, he was on his sec­ond post­ing at Ng Teng Fong Gen­eral Hos­pi­tal when he was con­tacted by the em­ployer of a pa­tient who ques­tioned him about a med­i­cal cer­tifi­cate he had is­sued. Dr Chua re­lented to the em­ployer’s de­mands and dis­closed in­for­ma­tion about the pa­tient to the em­ployer with­out the pa­tient’s con­sent.</p>
    <p>In May 2016, the SMC re­ceived a com­plaint against Dr Chua. The SMC brought six charges against him for pro­fes­sional mis­con­duct – one for breach­ing pa­tient con­fi­den­tial­ity, two for the au­thor­ship claims, and three for the af­fil­i­a­tion claims. In a split de­ci­sion, two tri­bunal mem­bers said an 18-month sus­pen­sion would suf­fice, while the mi­nor­ity opin­ion was that a strik­ing-off was war­ranted.</p>
