    <p>The Na­tional Cen­tre for In­fec­tious Dis­eases (NCID) is ac­tively re­view­ing the lat­est con­flict­ing find­ings sur­round­ing the an­tivi­ral drug remde­sivir, though the drug re­mains a treat­ment op­tion for Covid-19 pa­tients in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>This comes after the World Health Or­gan­i­sa­tion (WHO) pub­lished in­terim re­sults of its Sol­i­dar­ity trial on Oct 15.</p>
    <p>The re­sults of WHO’s trial in­di­cate that remde­sivir has lit­tle or no ef­fect on how long Covid-19 pa­tients stay in hos­pi­tal or on their chances of sur­vival.</p>
    <p>NCID’s Covid-19 ther­a­peu­tic work­group is hence ac­tively re­view­ing the fi­nal re­port from the first United States Na­tional In­sti­tutes of Health adap­tive Covid-19 treat­ment trial (ACTT1) that was re­leased re­cently, along with a pre-print doc­u­ment from WHO’s Sol­i­dar­ity trial.</p>
    <p>ACTT1 stud­ied the ef­fi­cacy of remde­sivir on Covid-19 pa­tients. A pre-print doc­u­ment is a re­search pa­per that has yet to be peer­re­viewed.</p>
    <p>The WHO has also fur­ther as­sem­bled an in­ter­na­tional team, which in­cludes rep­re­sen­ta­tives from Sin­ga­pore, to fur­ther dis­cuss the lat­est find­ings be­fore is­su­ing an up­date on treat­ment rec­om­men­da­tion, NCID told The Straits Times.</p>
    <p>Remde­sivir was de­vel­oped by US drug­maker Gilead Sci­ences. It re­ceived con­di­tional ap­proval by Sin­ga­pore’s Health Sci­ences Au­thor­ity to be used out­side of clin­i­cal tri­als in June.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, there is no change to the cur­rent treat­ment ap­proach in</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore. In­fec­tious dis­ease spe­cial­ists can ad­min­is­ter remde­sivir to pa­tients with low oxy­gen sat­u­ra­tion lev­els, less than or equal to 94 per cent, or those who might re­quire sup­ple­men­tal oxy­gen or more in­ten­sive breath­ing sup­port.</p>
    <p>“It is im­por­tant to re­it­er­ate that this is a new dis­ease and con­tin­u­ous re­search and clin­i­cal tri­als are on­go­ing to bring the best treat­ment op­tions and strate­gies to pa­tients.</p>
    <p>Treat­ment guide­line is a liv­ing doc­u­ment that re­quires up­date as and when new knowl­edge is made avail­able,” NCID said.</p>
    <p>Con­tin­u­ous em­pha­sis must be placed on early case de­tec­tion, close mon­i­tor­ing of dis­ease pro­gres­sion and early in­ter­ven­tion, NCID stressed.</p>
    <p>Com­pa­nies such as Gilead have been racing to find a treat­ment for Covid-19. Some 1.1 mil­lion peo­ple have died and 41 mil­lion have been re­ported in­fected by the coro­n­avirus, which has thrown the global econ­omy into dis­ar­ray.</p>
    <p>Remde­sivir was among the first drugs to be used in the treat­ment of Covid-19. It was also one of the drugs re­cently used to treat US Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump after he tested pos­i­tive for Covid-19. It has been shown in pre­vi­ous stud­ies to have cut re­cov­ery time.</p>
    <p>Gilead raised con­cerns over WHO’s data, say­ing that the data ap­peared in­con­sis­tent, the find­ings were pre­ma­ture and that other stud­ies had val­i­dated the drug’s ben­e­fits.</p>
    <p>WHO has since re­sponded to de­fend the trial’s data.</p>
    <p>“It’s a re­li­able re­sult. Don’t let any­body tell you oth­er­wise, be­cause they’ll try to,” Dr Richard Peto, an in­de­pen­dent statis­ti­cian hired by the WHO to eval­u­ate its Sol­i­dar­ity trial, told re­porters.</p>
    <p>He added that any ben­e­fit remde­sivir has may be due to chance.</p>
