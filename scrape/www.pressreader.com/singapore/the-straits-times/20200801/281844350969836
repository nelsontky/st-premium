    <p>Ja­pan’s re­cent adop­tion of greener poli­cies is in part due to global pres­sure, en­vi­ron­ment ob­servers say, not­ing en­cour­ag­ing signs amid the baby steps the coun­try is tak­ing to move from its heavy reliance on fos­sil fu­els to re­new­ables.</p>
    <p>Mr Shin Fu­runo of the Asia In­vestor Group on Cli­mate Change told The Straits Times that the re­cent progress has also been due to fall­ing costs of re­new­able en­ergy tech­nolo­gies and a greater ex­pec­ta­tion among the global com­mu­nity that Ja­pan should be a re­gional leader in de­car­bon­i­sa­tion, given its tech­ni­cal so­phis­ti­ca­tion.</p>
    <p>Ja­pan said last month that it will re­tire 100 age­ing, in­ef­fi­cient coal plants over the next decade. It has 140 units in op­er­a­tion, of which 114 are deemed un­pro­duc­tive and the other 26 highly ef­fi­cient. An­other 16 are be­ing built.</p>
    <p>The coun­try also pledged to build more off­shore wind farms that can gen­er­ate a com­bined 30 gi­gawatts of power by 2040. It now gen­er­ates just 20,000 kilo­watts through such farms. One gi­gawatt is equal to one mil­lion kilo­watts.</p>
    <p>It will also re­strict the fi­nanc­ing of new coal-fired power plants abroad, promis­ing not to pro­vide such sup­port “in prin­ci­ple”.</p>
    <p>Mr Hiroaki Nakan­ishi, chair­man of the busi­ness lobby Kei­dan­ren, has thrown his weight be­hind re­new­able en­ergy, call­ing for “an en­ergy pol­icy that will fa­cil­i­tate more in­vest­ment in elec­tric power, in­clud­ing re­new­able en­ergy and R&D spend­ing”.</p>
    <p>The green moves come af­ter Ja­pan was shamed at the COP25 cli­mate con­fer­ence last year, where the world’s third-largest econ­omy was given the satir­i­cal Fos­sil Award twice.</p>
    <p>Do­mes­ti­cally, Ja­pan has been bat­tered by more bru­tal sum­mers, warmer win­ters, stronger ty­phoons and record-break­ing rain­fall, in­clud­ing in Ku­mamoto and Ya­m­a­gata last month. This would have given pol­i­cy­mak­ers rea­son to think about the harsh re­al­ity of cli­mate change.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, a ba­sic en­ergy pol­icy set in 2018 for the 2030 fi­nan­cial year is up for re­newal and an­a­lysts are pay­ing at­ten­tion to how far Ja­pan will go to shun coal. Un­der the cur­rent plan, Ja­pan aims to re­duce its coal de­pen­dency from 32 per cent to 26 per cent and in­crease its tar­get for re­new­ables from 17 per cent to 22-24 per cent. The rest will be from nu­clear power and nat­u­ral gas.</p>
    <p>“There is grow­ing aware­ness that cli­mate change risks have an ad­verse im­pact on eco­nomic ac­tiv­ity,” Dr Mikiko Kainuma, a se­nior re­search ad­viser at the In­sti­tute for Global En­vi­ron­men­tal Strate­gies, told The Straits Times.</p>
    <p>“Con­cur­rently, the cor­po­rate sec­tor has cot­toned on that it can­not sur­vive with­out any re­sponse to cli­mate change risks.”</p>
    <p>She con­curred with an assess­ment by Dr Takeshi Ku­ramochi, a cli­mate pol­icy re­searcher at the NewCli­mate In­sti­tute in Ger­many, that the pledge to moth­ball old coal plants does not go far enough, as at least 20 per cent of Ja­pan’s en­ergy sup­ply is ex­pected to be fu­elled by coal by 2030.</p>
    <p>In this vein, Dr Ku­ramochi said the an­nounce­ments are “in­di­vid­u­ally rather small steps”, though they might col­lec­tively sig­nal “a ma­jor shift – al­beit re­luc­tantly – in Ja­pan’s cli­mate pol­icy”. Given the ap­par­ent shift by the Min­istry of Econ­omy, Trade and In­dus­try, he said: “It is quite prob­a­ble that sev­eral of cur­rently planned high-ef­fi­ciency coal power plant con­struc­tion plans would be can­celled in the next few years as the cir­cum­stances be­come even tougher for coal.”</p>
    <p>Dr Kainuma noted that Ja­pan has de­voted only 11.5 bil­lion yen (S$150 mil­lion) – or 0.03 per cent of the 31.8 tril­lion yen sup­ple­men­tary bud­get for the cur­rent fi­nan­cial year – to green poli­cies, which is in­suf­fi­cient against de­car­bon­i­sa­tion.</p>
    <p>The push to build more off­shore wind farms, she added, will still face hur­dles be­cause of grid is­sues, en­vi­ron­ment as­sess­ments and high costs that will re­quire po­lit­i­cal will to over­come.</p>
    <p>Mr Fu­runo has cited sci­en­tific data show­ing that ther­mal coal needs to be phased out al­most com­pletely in de­vel­oped na­tions by 2030 and in emerg­ing economies by 2040.</p>
    <p>He added that ide­ally, to ad­e­quately play its role un­der the Paris Agree­ment that aims to cap global warm­ing at 1.5 deg C by</p>
    <p>2100, Ja­pan should in­crease its pro­por­tion of re­new­ables to 50 per cent.</p>
    <p>“Rather than com­pet­ing in the race to the bot­tom on ther­mal coal, Ja­pan could play to its strengths in en­ergy ef­fi­ciency and bat­tery tech­nol­ogy and con­trib­ute to the in­stal­la­tion of modern green grid in­fra­struc­ture,” he said.</p>
    <p>Mr Fu­runo added: “Cen­tral to this shift will be a deeper recog­ni­tion that the sys­temic risks of cli­mate change jeop­ar­dise fu­ture eco­nomic health and wel­fare of Ja­pan, and the coun­try’s eco­nomic or so­cial goals will not be achieved if cli­mate ob­jec­tives are not ad­e­quately ad­dressed.”</p>
    <p>TIME TO TAKE AC­TION</p>
    <p>There is grow­ing aware­ness that cli­mate change risks have an ad­verse im­pact on eco­nomic ac­tiv­ity. Con­cur­rently, the cor­po­rate sec­tor has cot­toned on that it can­not sur­vive with­out any re­sponse to cli­mate ’’ change risks.</p>
