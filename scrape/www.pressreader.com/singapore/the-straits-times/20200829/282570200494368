    <p>My fam­ily has two se­nior cats aged 16 and 12. Re­cently, I found their fae­ces and urine in places other than the lit­ter box. Does this hap­pen with cats in old age? What can I do to re­train them to defe­cate only in their lit­ter box?</p>
    <p>Ger­maine Ong</p>
    <p>First, it would be use­ful to con­sider if there have been any re­cent changes in the house en­vi­ron­ment, such as a new pet be­ing in­tro­duced. That may have caused stress to your cats, re­sult­ing in the change in their toi­let be­hav­iour.</p>
    <p>You may also want to take your cats to the vet to rule out any med­i­cal con­di­tions that may have caused pain dur­ing uri­na­tion or defe­ca­tion. The cats may as­so­ci­ate the pain with the lit­ter box and avoid it.</p>
    <p>Also, see if your se­nior cats can eas­ily ac­cess the lit­ter­box as mo­bil­ity is­sues such as arthri­tis may make it dif­fi­cult for them to reach the lit­ter­box.</p>
    <p>You should also check if there have been any changes to the lit­ter box or lit­ter types. Most cats do not like scented lit­ter and some may not adapt to a change in lit­ter types if they have be­come used to the old one.</p>
    <p>Ide­ally, the lit­ter­box should be placed where the cat can feel safe and se­cure while toi­let­ing.</p>
    <p>Fi­nally, en­sure there are suf­fi­cient lit­ter boxes for both cats in the house.</p>
    <p>A rule of thumb for de­cid­ing how many lit­ter boxes to have is: the num­ber of cats plus one.</p>
    <p>The boxes should also be lo­cated in dif­fer­ent parts of the house, to avoid con­flict when the cats need to use the lit­ter tray at the same time.</p>
    <p>Also, pay at­ten­tion to the stool qual­ity and ap­pear­ance of the urine.</p>
    <p>Any signs of di­ar­rhoea or blood in the fae­ces or urine would war­rant a visit to the vet.</p>
