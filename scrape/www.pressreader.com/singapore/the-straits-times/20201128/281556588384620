    <p>Argentinia­n foot­ball leg­end Diego Maradona was laid to rest in a pri­vate cer­e­mony on Thurs­day in Buenos Aires, a day after fans who were un­able to pay their re­spects at the pres­i­den­tial palace clashed with riot po­lice.</p>
    <p>In Naples, his for­mer club Napoli beat Croa­tia’s Ri­jeka 2-0 in the Europa League, with the en­tire team wear­ing his iconic No. 10 jer­sey.</p>
    <p>BUENOS AIRES • Argentinia­n foot­ball leg­end Diego Maradona was laid to rest on Thurs­day after a pri­vate fu­neral on the out­skirts of the coun­try’s cap­i­tal.</p>
    <p>As darkness fell, he was in­terred after a sim­ple re­li­gious cer­e­mony at­tended by fam­ily and close friends in the leafy sur­rounds of the Jardin Bella Vista ceme­tery amid a global out­pour­ing of grief.</p>
    <p>Maradona was buried next to the graves of his par­ents, Diego Sr and Tota. His for­mer wife Clau­dia Vil­lafane, 58, and three of his daugh­ters – Dalma, 33, Gian­nina, 31, and Jana, 23 – as well as for­mer Manch­ester United for­ward Car­los Tevez were among those at the fu­neral.</p>
    <p>For­mer girl­friend Veron­ica Ojeda, 42, and their seven-year-old son Die­guito Fer­nando were also present. Se­cu­rity was tight, and lo­cal me­dia re­ported that it took place un­der a gazebo to pre­vent me­dia drones from in­trud­ing.</p>
    <p>The death of Maradona at the age of 60 on Wed­nes­day, fol­low­ing a heart at­tack, has sparked both mourn­ing and cel­e­bra­tions of a true sport­ing star, who was a ge­nius on the foot­ball field but lived a life marred by strug­gles with drug and al­co­hol ad­dic­tion and obe­sity.</p>
    <p>The burial fol­lowed a day of high emo­tion that saw clashes be­tween po­lice and fans near the pres­i­den­tial palace in cen­tral Buenos Aires where the 1986 World Cup win­ner lay in state in a closed cas­ket for peo­ple to say their fi­nal farewells.</p>
    <p>Tens of thou­sands of peo­ple cir­cled the pink-hued Casa Rosada – the queue was es­ti­mated at more than 1.6km long – and there was a febrile at­mos­phere more akin to a rowdy foot­ball game than a for­mal wake, with fans clam­ber­ing up the palace gates to get as close as pos­si­ble to their hero.</p>
    <p>The au­thor­i­ties strug­gled to main­tain safe distancing among the masses, but so­cial worker and fan Rosa Monje said it was un­der­stand­able de­spite the preva­lence of the coro­n­avirus in the coun­try.</p>
    <p>“It is im­pos­si­ble to ask them to dis­tance. We be­have re­spect­fully and of­fer them sani­tis­ers and face masks,” she said, adding her trib­ute to Maradona tear­fully: “I told him, to vic­tory al­ways, Diego.”</p>
    <p>The snaking line led to some frus­trated fans tak­ing over a court­yard in­side the palace where they chanted slo­gans, forc­ing of­fi­cials to move his cof­fin to an­other room as a se­cu­rity pre­cau­tion.</p>
    <p>A gov­ern­ment de­ci­sion to grant a three-hour ex­ten­sion to the wake to al­low time for the crowd to pay their re­spects proved to be in­suf­fi­cient, and as the au­thor­i­ties started to close down ac­cess to the cen­tral square, scuf­fles broke out.</p>
    <p>Riot po­lice used rub­ber bul­lets and wa­ter can­non to dis­perse the un­ruly masses and en­gaged in clashes with stone-throw­ing fans on streets around the palace, re­sult­ing in the ar­rest of sev­eral peo­ple.</p>
    <p>How­ever, the heavy-handed ap­proach drew the ire of In­te­rior Min­is­ter Wado de Pe­dro, who de­fended the peo­ple’s right to see Maradona’s body, call­ing the clam­p­down a “re­pres­sion”.</p>
    <p>The ten­sions even­tu­ally eased after the body was trans­ferred by hearse, sur­rounded by a huge en­tourage. The roads were lined with peo­ple chant­ing, “Diego is not dead, Diego lives in the peo­ple”, as it passed on the hour-long jour­ney to Bella Vista.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day marked the fi­nal day of a three-day na­tional mourn­ing for the play­maker who was never far from con­tro­versy, but as the cat­a­lyst for their sec­ond World Cup tri­umph, will for­ever be revered with cult-like sta­tus in Ar­gentina.</p>
