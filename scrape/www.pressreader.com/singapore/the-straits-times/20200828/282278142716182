    <p>Raf­fles Ed­u­ca­tion Corp’s board will not con­vene an ex­tra­or­di­nary gen­eral meet­ing (EGM) for share­hold­ers to vote on bil­lion­aire Oei Hong Leong’s pro­posed res­o­lu­tions.</p>
    <p>Mr Oei had again sought to re­move Raf­fles Ed­u­ca­tion founder Chew Hua Seng as chair­man and chief ex­ec­u­tive in an EGM req­ui­si­tion no­tice sent last week.</p>
    <p>Raf­fles Ed­u­ca­tion said it ob­tained le­gal ad­vice, and was ad­vised that the re­quest was with­out merit.</p>
    <p>It said in a bourse fil­ing late on Wed­nes­day, based on the Com­pa­nies Act and the firm’s own mem­o­ran­dum and ar­ti­cles of as­so­ci­a­tion, that the pro­posed res­o­lu­tions con­cerned sub­jects out­side the prov­ince of the share­hold­ers at the gen­eral meet­ing.</p>
    <p>Also, the no­tice was is­sued af­ter lo­cal courts dis­missed Mr Oei and his firm’s lawsuit against Mr Chew on an al­leged hand­writ­ten agree­ment that was cited in one of the res­o­lu­tions ear­marked for the pro­posed EGM.</p>
    <p>“In the cir­cum­stances”, the board is not re­quired to con­vene an EGM for the pur­poses of vot­ing on the pro­posed res­o­lu­tions, Raf­fles Ed­u­ca­tion said.</p>
    <p>Sep­a­rately, the pri­vate ed­u­ca­tion provider fell into the red with a net loss of $16.4 mil­lion for the 12 months to June 30, com­pared with a net profit of $40.2 mil­lion in the pre­vi­ous year.</p>
    <p>The chal­leng­ing global ed­u­ca­tion en­vi­ron­ment, vo­latil­ity, in­creas­ing com­pe­ti­tion and the pan­demic con­tin­ued to weigh on the group’s per­for­mance.</p>
    <p>In par­tic­u­lar, for­eign stu­dent numbers since Jan­u­ary have taken a hit from bor­der re­stric­tions and lock­downs. This un­cer­tainty will con­tinue to im­pact the group, Raf­fles Ed­u­ca­tion said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Loss per share stood at 1.19 cents, com­pared with earn­ings per share of 2.92 cents a year ear­lier.</p>
    <p>Rev­enue inched up 3 per cent to $100.5 mil­lion, largely thanks to higher turnover from South-east Asia. It was off­set by lower rev­enue from Aus­tralia, due to the sale of an in­vest­ment prop­erty in New South Wales last Novem­ber.</p>
    <p>No div­i­dend was de­clared for the year, “due to the pan­demic and on a pru­dence ba­sis”, Raf­fles Ed­u­ca­tion said. There was also no div­i­dend de­clared for the 2019 fi­nan­cial year.</p>
    <p>Raf­fles Ed­u­ca­tion shares closed down 0.9 per cent at 10.9 cents yes­ter­day.</p>
