    <p>Busi­ness con­fi­dence for the first quar­ter of next year has risen a touch, but it re­mains in the con­trac­tionary zone, noted a sur­vey yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The poll mea­sures busi­ness con­fi­dence by track­ing six pa­ram­e­ters: sales vol­ume, net profit, sell­ing price, new or­ders, in­ven­tory lev­els and em­ployee count.</p>
    <p>The fi­nan­cial, man­u­fac­tur­ing and ser­vices sec­tors saw vis­i­ble im­prove­ments in sen­ti­ment, while the out­look in the con­struc­tion and trans­port sec­tors re­mained down­beat, noted the Sin­ga­pore Com­mer­cial Credit Bureau (SCCB), which car­ried out the study.</p>
    <p>The fi­nan­cial sec­tor was rel­a­tively up­beat, with all six in­di­ca­tors in pos­i­tive ter­ri­tory.</p>
    <p>Man­u­fac­tur­ing also re­mained rel­a­tively op­ti­mistic, with four out of six in­di­ca­tors in the pos­i­tive zone. In­di­ca­tors such as vol­ume of sales and net profit saw de­creases.</p>
    <p>The ser­vice sec­tor was moder­ately up­beat, with half of the six in­di­ca­tors in pos­i­tive ter­ri­tory. In­di­ca­tors such as sales vol­ume and net profit saw slight drops, while em­ploy­ment lev­els dipped.</p>
    <p>The con­struc­tion sec­tor was the most pes­simistic sec­tor, with all six in­di­ca­tors in the con­trac­tionary zone.</p>
    <p>How­ever, vis­i­ble im­prove­ments were seen in half of the in­di­ca­tors – vol­ume of sales, net profit and em­ploy­ment lev­els.</p>
    <p>Sen­ti­ment in the trans­port sec­tor re­mained weak, with four out of six in­di­ca­tors in the neg­a­tive zone.</p>
    <p>SCCB chief ex­ec­u­tive Au­drey Chia said: “While there is a slight up­turn in busi­ness sen­ti­ments for the first quar­ter of 2021, the over­all economy is not en­tirely out of the woods yet.”</p>
    <p>The SCCB ex­pects sen­ti­ment to re­main volatile for the first six months of next year, she added.</p>
