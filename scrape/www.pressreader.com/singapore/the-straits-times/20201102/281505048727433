    <p>What is the one thing I can do to help my child do well in school?</p>
    <p>It is a ques­tion many par­ents have posed to me over my years of writ­ing on ed­u­ca­tion for The Straits Times.</p>
    <p>I used to give them var­ied ad­vice – from pick­ing the right school to fo­cus­ing on de­vel­op­ing nu­mer­acy and lit­er­acy skills.</p>
    <p>But in re­cent years, af­ter hav­ing dug deep into ed­u­ca­tion re­search and talk­ing to ex­pe­ri­enced ed­u­ca­tors, I have a more de­fin­i­tive an­swer for par­ents.</p>
    <p>Raise your child to be a reader. It would be even bet­ter if your child grows up to read books for the sheer plea­sure of it.</p>
    <p>This may sound ob­vi­ous, but par­ents may not know the science be­hind read­ing and how com­pelling the ev­i­dence on it is.</p>
    <p>One of the most im­por­tant stud­ies to show a link be­tween read­ing and cog­ni­tive devel­op­ment is the Bri­tish Co­hort Study, which fol­lows the lives of more than 17,000 peo­ple born in a sin­gle week in 1970 in Eng­land, Scot­land and Wales.</p>
    <p>Ev­ery few years, the study team in­ter­views the par­tic­i­pants to track dif­fer­ent as­pects of their lives, from ed­u­ca­tion and em­ploy­ment to phys­i­cal and men­tal health. The idea is to un­der­stand what in­flu­ences an in­di­vid­ual’s devel­op­ment over a long pe­riod of time.</p>
    <p>Of the 17,000 mem­bers, 6,000 took a range of cog­ni­tive tests at age 16. When the re­search team com­pared chil­dren from the same so­cial back­grounds, it dis­cov­ered that those who fre­quently read books at age 10, and more than once a week when they were 16, had higher test re­sults than those who read less.</p>
    <p>Read­ing for plea­sure was linked to greater in­tel­lec­tual progress, in vo­cab­u­lary, spell­ing and, sur­pris­ingly, math­e­mat­ics as well. In fact, the im­pact of read­ing was around four times greater than that of hav­ing a par­ent with a post­sec­ondary de­gree.</p>
    <p>There was a 14.4 per cent ad­van­tage in vo­cab­u­lary, a 9.9 per cent ad­van­tage in math­e­mat­ics and an 8.6 per cent ad­van­tage in spell­ing, the re­search found, once par­ents’ back­grounds and read­ing habits were taken into ac­count.</p>
    <p>The study said: “The in­flu­ence of read­ing for plea­sure was greater than that of hav­ing a par­ent with a de­gree.”</p>
    <p>The to­tal ef­fect of read­ing on chil­dren’s progress was of­ten four times greater than the ad­van­tage of hav­ing a univer­sity-ed­u­cated par­ent.</p>
    <p>Read­ing clearly in­tro­duces young peo­ple to new words, so the link be­tween read­ing for plea­sure and vo­cab­u­lary devel­op­ment is ex­pected. But the link be­tween read­ing for fun and progress in math­e­mat­ics may be more sur­pris­ing.</p>
    <p>Re­searchers who have stud­ied this link say that the devel­op­ment of math­e­mat­ics and read­ing skills is in­ter­wo­ven.</p>
    <p>Es­sen­tially, both math­e­mat­ics and read­ing rely on un­der­stand­ing a sym­bolic code, whether com­posed of num­bers or let­ters.</p>
    <p>Also, for both read­ing and math­e­mat­ics, stu­dents have to un­der­stand, make pre­dic­tions, de­ter­mine im­por­tance and make con­nec­tions.</p>
    <p>Read­ing also im­proves a child’s abil­ity to fo­cus and con­cen­trate. It also forces the child to sort things out in his or her own mind – in­clud­ing top­ics that might not be fa­mil­iar.</p>
    <p>Even a child of pre-school age with a rel­a­tively sim­ple book must keep in mind a group of char­ac­ters, the set­ting and past ac­tions. Read­ing helps to strengthen mem­o­ryre­ten­tion skills. That is a pow­er­ful tool for young stu­dents.</p>
    <p>It de­vel­ops crit­i­cal and an­a­lyt­i­cal think­ing skills.</p>
    <p>Let us take a child who be­comes ab­sorbed with a mys­tery book and man­ages to solve the mys­tery in his or her head be­fore the book re­veals the an­swer. That is a sim­ple ex­am­ple of how read­ing helps stu­dents de­velop bet­ter crit­i­cal and an­a­lyt­i­cal skills, some­thing that car­ries over even af­ter they have put the book down.</p>
    <p>Let us not for­get about the con­fi­dence and self-es­teem that read­ing builds in chil­dren.</p>
    <p>This might be the most im­por­tant area of all. The sooner stu</p>
    <p>dents de­velop the abil­ity to read, the more they de­velop all the skills stated above. The abil­ity to speak and write and the ex­panded knowl­edge base boost the con­fi­dence of chil­dren.</p>
    <p>The other ques­tion that arises is, why does read­ing for plea­sure make a big­ger dif­fer­ence than other fac­tors?</p>
    <p>In fact, when Bri­tain’s Read­ing Agency pub­lished its Lit­er­a­ture Re­view in 2015, a meta-study of hun­dreds of other stud­ies over many years, the head­line con­clu­sion was “Read­ing for plea­sure has a dra­matic im­pact on life out­comes”.</p>
    <p>The re­search showed that it was not just the daily act of read­ing, but also the en­joy­ment of it, that made the dif­fer­ence. Hence the phrase “read­ing for plea­sure”.</p>
    <p>The study found the daily read­ing for plea­sure pos­i­tively af­fects men­tal health, self-es­teem, vo­cab­u­lary, gen­eral knowl­edge, re­la­tion­ships, mood con­trol, em­pa­thy, sel­f­un­der­stand­ing and stress lev­els.</p>
    <p>When a child reads for plea­sure, he or she de­vel­ops the ca­pac­ity to im­merse him­self or her­self in the story, to vi­su­alise mean­ings, re­late to char­ac­ters, and par­tic­i­pate in mak­ing mean­ing.</p>
    <p>The child re­lates to the char­ac­ters and one­self by ex­plor­ing and stak­ing one’s iden­tity. This plea­sure de­vel­ops the ca­pac­ity to ex­pe­ri­ence the world from other per­spec­tives; to learn from and ap­pre­ci­ate oth­ers.</p>
    <p>At this point, if you are con­vinced about the mul­ti­ple ben­e­fits of read­ing, as I am, then you can look for­ward to more ar­ti­cles, videos and ex­plain­ers on how to de­velop the read­ing habit in your child over the next few weeks.</p>
