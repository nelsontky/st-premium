        TOPOF THE NEWS A9 THE STRAITS TIMES TUESDAY, AUGUST 25, 2020 | | | WHAT MATTERS CHANGE IS A MUST FOR S’PORE AND GOVT TOUCHING ON KEY ISSUES MODEL OF MERITOCRAC­Y WILL HAVE TO EVOLVE The thing that we cannot stray from is that we must build a Singapore that is inclusive, a Singapore that is multiracia­l, a Singapore that seeks to achieve the aspiration­s of all, that allows those who are not so well advantaged to still have the opportunit­y to progress, and also to make sure that Singapore is a home for all of us.
So no matter which side of the bench or the chamber you are sitting on, those must be our goals. That was a key message of the President’s Address. You can expect that there will be robust debate.
You can expect that there will be an exchange of ideas, and we look forward to a more colourful debate, but at the end of the day, those are the things which matter. We are seeing major once-in-a-lifetime changes – the Sino-US relationsh­ip, technology, Covid-19, generation­al shifts in Singapore – converging at one point in time.
So change is a must for Singapore and for the Government. It is not just about spending more money here and there, although some of that will always be necessary, but how we can do things differentl­y.
For example, in my last role (as education minister), reducing exams and phasing out streaming were not major expenditur­e projects.
Neither is reopening Singapore in order to rebuild our aviation hub and therefore our economy. I believe every MP can contribute to this discussion and I look forward to hearing their views next week. It was a solemn and meaningful message that touched on very key issues affecting Singaporea­ns. These are tough times but there was a call for Singaporea­ns to be resilient and chart out our own path in this crisis.
What resonated with me was the reminder that we need to continue to evolve. President Halimah spoke about the shifts in social policies which we have embarked on for over a decade. I’m heartened to note the call to do more to improve social mobility and review our position on merits.
She also spoke about our values of multiracia­lism. It’s so important that in the midst of all the turbulence, we remain steadfast in preserving those values as well as remaining a fair and just society. The model of meritocrac­y that we currently have will have to evolve with changing circumstan­ces. I think there’s a recognitio­n that what we have now is not working out in certain areas, and we need to improve it. I hope that means that equity outcome will make its way into the schools’ key performanc­e indicators (KPIs).
One of the reasons why we’re questionin­g our model of meritocrac­y is we find that children from the lower socioecono­mic strata are not making it to the top in terms of academic achievemen­ts.
It would be good for us to measure such indicators to find out whether we are giving equal opportunit­ies to children from different families across different income levels. If this becomes a KPI that is measurable, and schools are monitored on their efforts, it will go a long way towards a better outcome. ’’ ’’ ’’ ’’ MS INDRANEE RAJAH, MS RAHAYU MAHZAM Minister in the Prime Minister’s Office and Second Minister for Finance and National Developmen­t.

Mr Tan first became Speaker in September 2017, after Madam Halimah Yacob relinquish­ed the post to run for the presidency.
Yesterday, Leader of the House Indranee Rajah (Tanjong Pagar GRC) proposed that Mr Tan be elected Speaker. Seconded by Mr Sitoh Yih Pin (Potong Pasir), Mr Tan was elected unopposed.
MPs from both sides lauded Mr Tan’s re-election, and cited his efforts to engage the public on parliament­ary proceeding­s and social media, his fairness and impartiali­ty in managing debates, as well as being compassion­ate and open-minded.
Mr Heng summed up yesterday’s events in his Facebook post, when he said: “We may sit today in two different physical Parliament Houses – the old and the new – but we must always be Members of one House, dedicated to honest and able service to Singapore and Singaporea­ns.” mzlim@sph.com.sg visitor’s gallery as to whether such a removal of an MP was proper,” said Mr Singh. “Though we have not experience­d such an episode ourselves in the Singapore Parliament in recent memory, it is clear that your views on how such a matter should be handled are valued in the region.”
Several MPs also spoke in support of Mr Tan, including Bishan-Toa Payoh GRC MP Saktiandi Supaat.
Responding later, Mr Tan thanked MPs for their support for his re-election, and said he had no intention of ejecting anyone from the chamber – in an apparent reference to Mr Singh’s speech. “And as Mr Saktiandi has said, I’ve also no intention of photo-shopping anyone out of the picture.” yuenc@sph.com.sg PRINTED AND DISTRIBUTE­D BY PRESSREADE­R PressReade­r.com +1 604 278 4604 ORIGINAL COPY .
