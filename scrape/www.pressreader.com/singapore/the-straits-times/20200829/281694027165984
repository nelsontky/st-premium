    <p>A se­ries of dia­logues for Sin­ga­pore­ans to re­flect on Covid-19 will give peo­ple the space to dis­cuss “breadand-but­ter and key so­ci­etal is­sues” and work with the Gov­ern­ment to trans­late th­ese ideas into ac­tion.</p>
    <p>Th­ese Emerg­ing Stronger Con­ver­sa­tions will be an in­clu­sive plat­form for Sin­ga­pore­ans to “re­flect and reimag­ine the fu­ture to­gether”, said Min­is­ter for Cul­ture, Com­mu­nity and Youth Ed­win Tong yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>His min­istry will also tap young peo­ple, cre­at­ing a 1,000-strong “dig­i­tal corps” to help com­mu­nity and so­cial sec­tor or­gan­i­sa­tions dig­i­talise.</p>
    <p>To fos­ter greater unity, more op­por­tu­ni­ties will be cre­ated for Sin­ga­pore­ans to en­gage in “re­spect­ful di­a­logue” on sen­si­tive is­sues of race and re­li­gion, he said in out­lin­ing his min­istry’s key pri­or­i­ties in an Ad­den­dum to the Pres­i­dent’s Ad­dress on Mon­day.</p>
    <p>Not­ing that peo­ple have come to­gether to sup­port one an­other dur­ing the Covid-19 cri­sis, he called for this spirit to con­tinue be­yond the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>“We have seen Sin­ga­pore­ans show­ing em­pa­thy, so­cial re­spon­si­bil­ity and neigh­bourli­ness – val­ues and be­hav­iours that un­der­pin a co­he­sive and car­ing so­ci­ety,” he said. “More ground-up move­ments are emerg­ing to prop­a­gate com­mu­nity-based ini­tia­tives for mu­tual sup­port and we will sup­port them.”</p>
    <p>Or­gan­i­sa­tions such as the Youth Corps Sin­ga­pore will help usher in this pos­i­tive change, with groundup projects able to get grants.</p>
    <p>The end goal is to strengthen the so­cial com­pact and get Sin­ga­pore­ans to in­ter­act and bond, said Mr Tong.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore has reached the mid­point of its five-year road maps for the arts and her­itage sec­tors, and th­ese plans are now be­ing re­viewed, he added.</p>
    <p>It will grow the arts scene de­spite the im­pact of the pan­demic, and cul­ti­vate its her­itage, both tan­gi­ble and in­tan­gi­ble. For in­stance, the #SGCul­tureAny­where ini­tia­tive com­piles vir­tual tours and per­for­mances that Sin­ga­pore­ans can watch “while our phys­i­cal spa­ces take a brief in­ter­lude”.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore also hopes to spur na­tional ath­letes with schemes, in­clud­ing schol­ar­ships and fund­ing. Other gov­ern­ment ef­forts to de­velop the sec­tor in­clude of­fer­ing af­ford­able pro­grammes un­der the Ac­tiveSG por­tal as well as con­tin­u­ing to build and up­grade sports fa­cil­i­ties.</p>
    <p>“Sports can in­spire Sin­ga­pore­ans to rally to­gether as a na­tion, and cel­e­brate with our sport­ing he­roes,” Mr Tong said.</p>
    <p>Young Sin­ga­pore­ans will also be equipped with the skills and knowl­edge to cap­i­talise on op­por­tu­ni­ties in the re­gion, through the Asi­aReady Ex­po­sure Pro­gramme.</p>
    <p>And youth-sec­tor or­gan­i­sa­tions will work with the Gov­ern­ment to cre­ate pro­grammes for young peo­ple. Th­ese in­clude life skills train­ing on top­ics such as fi­nan­cial plan­ning and men­tal well-be­ing re­sources.</p>
    <p>Young peo­ple who wish to start ground-up ef­forts to pro­mote men­tal well-be­ing will also get sup­port through the Youth Men­tal Well-be­ing Net­work, Mr Tong added.</p>
    <p>“Sin­ga­pore­ans have un­der­gone a shared ex­pe­ri­ence that has changed our lives,” he said. “We must re­flect on and learn from what is hap­pen­ing and how we can emerge stronger as a so­ci­ety.”</p>
