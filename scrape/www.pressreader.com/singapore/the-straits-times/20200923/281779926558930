    <p>Since In­dia’s Par­lia­ment re­opened on Sept 14 with so­cial dis­tanc­ing mea­sures, af­ter five months of coro­n­avirus-in­duced re­stric­tions, its ses­sions have been any­thing but smooth sail­ing.</p>
    <p>Howls of protest from op­po­si­tion par­ties greeted the gov­ern­ment’s can­cel­la­tion of Ques­tion Hour for par­lia­men­tar­i­ans to ask ques­tions of min­is­ters.</p>
    <p>But few an­tic­i­pated data short­ages and ab­sence of mean­ing­ful de­bate on cru­cial is­sues.</p>
    <p>When asked i mpor­tant ques­tions on the pan­demic and the na­tion­wide lock­down im­posed since March 24, var­i­ous min­istries said they did not have the in­for­ma­tion.</p>
    <p>On open­ing day of the new Par­lia­ment ses­sion, MPs from Tamil Nadu and Ma­ha­rash­tra asked the Labour Min­istry for de­tails of mi­grant work­ers who had re­turned home dur­ing the lock­down, those who had died dur­ing their jour­neys, and the com­pen­sa­tion re­ceived by their fam­i­lies.</p>
    <p>The min­istry said nearly 10.5 mil­lion work­ers had left for home. But on the death num­bers, it said “No such data was main­tained” and so the ques­tion of com­pen­sa­tion “does not arise”.</p>
    <p>The lock­down had prompted mil­lions of mi­grant work­ers to flee the cities, of­ten on foot, for their homes in the coun­try­side. The mag­a­zine In­dia To­day had doc­u­mented de­tails of 238 mi­grant work­ers who died en route home.</p>
    <p>The gov­ern­ment also said it had no data on job losses among mi­grant work­ers. Like­wise, it had no in­for­ma­tion about po­lice per­son­nel who had died from Covid-19.</p>
    <p>When asked for the num­ber of health­care work­ers who had been in­fected by and died from the coro­n­avirus, again, it said it did not have the data.</p>
    <p>In­stead it of­fered in­for­ma­tion on the fam­i­lies of 155 health­care work­ers, in­clud­ing 64 doc­tors, who had sought life in­surance pay­outs un­der a gov­ern­ment scheme.</p>
    <p>The day af­ter the gov­ern­ment’s re­ply, an in­fu­ri­ated In­dian Med­i­cal As­so­ci­a­tion pub­lished a list of 382 doc­tors who had died of Covid-19, and de­manded they “be ac­knowl­edged and treated as mar­tyrs”.</p>
    <p>The as­so­ci­a­tion said a gov­ern­ment that does not main­tain data about health­care work­ers “loses the moral author­ity” to ad­min­is­ter laws to deal with the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>“To feign that this in­for­ma­tion does not merit the at­ten­tion of the na­tion is abom­inable,” it wrote.</p>
    <p>On Satur­day, var­i­ous min­is­ters claimed they had no data on cru­cial ques­tions.</p>
    <p>The Ed­u­ca­tion Min­istry, when asked, said it does not keep data of the num­ber of stu­dent sui­cides dur­ing the lock­down.</p>
    <p>Sim­i­larly, the Min­istry of Mi­cro, Small and Medium En­ter­prises had no data on the num­ber of busi­nesses that had shut down be­cause of eco­nomic dis­tress since March, or even on the num­ber that had shut down since 2014 when the gov­ern­ment first came to power.</p>
    <p>When the Labour Min­istry was asked for de­tails of sui­cides by mi­grant work­ers, it said it was still col­lect­ing the in­for­ma­tion from state gov­ern­ments.</p>
    <p>On Sun­day, the gov­ern­ment said it did not keep cen­tralised data on the num­ber of plasma banks treat­ing Covid-19 pa­tients.</p>
    <p>“It is a new method of thwart­ing the right to in­for­ma­tion,” said Mr Nikhil Dey, a trans­parency ac­tivist and co-founder of the Maz­door Kisan Shakti San­gathan whose long cam­paign had led In­dia to pass a law in 2005 grant­ing cit­i­zens the right to in­for­ma­tion.</p>
    <p>“If you don’t col­lect in­con­ve­nient data, you don’t need to pro­vide in­for­ma­tion that might lead to ac­count­abil­ity. Not to cit­i­zens and not to MPs,” he added.</p>
    <p>Amid the claims of hav­ing no data, the Par­lia­ment passed on Satur­day three con­tro­ver­sial laws on agri­cul­ture re­forms by voice vote.</p>
    <p>Many op­po­si­tion lead­ers, call­ing this un­demo­cratic, had asked for elec­tronic vot­ing as is nor­mally done on ro­bustly de­bated poli­cies.</p>
    <p>The par­lia­men­tary ses­sion ends on Oct 1, mark­ing the last sit­ting for this year.</p>
