    <p>More than 3,000 s mall and medium-sized en­ter­prises (SMEs) will be equipped with dig­i­tal­i­sa­tion skills from we­bi­nars hosted by OCBC Bank by the year end.</p>
    <p>More t han 5,000 em­ploy­ees from around 2,500 SMEs have at­tended the OCBC Vir­tual SME Cam­pus we­bi­nars since they be­gan in April dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker pe­riod, said the bank in a state­ment to­day.</p>
    <p>The we­bi­nars, which equip SME own­ers with the dig­i­tal knowl­edge needed to trans­form their busi­nesses, were cre­ated in part­ner­ship with En­ter­prise Sin­ga­pore, Ama­zon, Google and Shopee, among oth­ers.</p>
    <p>More than 30 two-hour we­bi­nars have been con­ducted so far.</p>
    <p>They ad­dressed im­me­di­ate con­cerns that SMEs faced dur­ing the two-month cir­cuit breaker, such as lever­ag­ing e-com­merce and dig­i­tal mar­ket­ing.</p>
    <p>Some we­bi­nars were spe­cially tai­lored to the hard-hit food and bev­er­age in­dus­try.</p>
    <p>More than 6,500 em­ploy­ees from SMEs are ex­pected to ben­e­fit by the year end, said the bank.</p>
    <p>Among those who at­tended was</p>
    <p>Mr Marc Ng, whose spe­cial­ity cof­fee roast­ing com­pany Awe­some Cof­fee did not have an e-com­merce pres­ence when the cir­cuit breaker started.</p>
    <p>Af­ter at­tend­ing four we­bi­nars, he cre­ated a web­site to help the business tide over the clo­sure of his re­tail out­let.</p>
    <p>He is now work­ing on the roll-out of a re­vamped web­site be­fore the up­com­ing 10.10 and 11.11 e-com­merce shop­ping fes­ti­vals.</p>
    <p>“The cir­cuit breaker served as a cat­a­lyst to speed up our process to cre­ate a dig­i­tal shop, and now it’s an ad­di­tional sales chan­nel for us,” he said.</p>
    <p>“Through the we­bi­nars, I was able to un­der­stand the dif­fer­ences be­tween run­ning a brick-and-mor­tar store, which I’m more fa­mil­iar with, and run­ning a dig­i­tal store­front.”</p>

    <p>Num­ber of SME em­ploy­ees ex­pected to ben­e­fit from the we­bi­nars by the year end.</p>
    <p>Ms Lim Geok Keng, founder of kom­bucha brand Chateaux, which be­gan oper­a­tions in Au­gust sell­ing fer­mented tea drinks, said she picked up use­ful in­for­ma­tion about grants and ser­vices for SMEs from the we­bi­nars.</p>
    <p>The 48-year-old also gained a bet­ter un­der­stand­ing of dig­i­tal mar­ket­ing is­sues.</p>
    <p>OCBC had pre­vi­ously rolled out a num­ber of dig­i­tal ini­tia­tives, in­clud­ing the Start Dig­i­tal Pack, which en­ables SMEs to im­ple­ment hu­man re­source, ac­count­ing, dig­i­tal mar­ket­ing, dig­i­tal trans­ac­tions and cy­ber­se­cu­rity so­lu­tions for free for at least six months.</p>
    <p>Ms Christie Chu, head of emerg­ing business and com­mer­cial bank­ing cash at OCBC, said: “A com­mon feed­back from our cus­tomers, es­pe­cially the smaller busi­nesses and start-ups, is that they know they have to adapt quickly but are un­sure of how to do so.</p>
    <p>“The pace of new de­vel­op­ments has also been over­whelm­ing, leav­ing some con­fused about what help is avail­able.</p>
    <p>“That’s where OCBC Vir­tual SME Cam­pus comes in to fill that knowl­edge gap and help SMEs bounce back stronger from this cri­sis.”</p>
