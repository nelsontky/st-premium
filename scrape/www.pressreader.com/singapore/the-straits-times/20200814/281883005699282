    <p>The re­gion is en­ter­ing a dif­fi­cult pe­riod with pan­demic num­bers climb­ing and closed bor­ders hit­ting busi­ness, trade and tourism. Economies are slow­ing or even con­tract­ing. Some voices in neigh­bour­ing coun­tries are turn­ing to­wards na­tion­al­ism and pro­tec­tion­ism – be­com­ing less open to for­eign­ers and the world.</p>
    <p>This im­pacts all coun­tries but es­pe­cially Sin­ga­pore, which has served as a re­gional hub. Yet there re­main rea­sons for Sin­ga­pore to en­gage and find new ways to move for­ward and out­ward into Asean.</p>
    <p>From its be­gin­ning dur­ing the Cold War, Asean has been a bul­wark to sta­bilise the re­gion.</p>
    <p>As Asean economies pros­pered and opened to global in­vest­ment and trade, Sin­ga­pore also ben­e­fited as a hub. Asean just marked its 53rd year on Aug 8 and Sin­ga­pore its 55th Na­tional Day one day later.</p>
    <p>How is Asean re­spond­ing? What are Sin­ga­pore’s needs and op­por­tu­ni­ties as a re­gional hub? Are new strate­gies needed?</p>
    <p>ASEAN AND THE PAN­DEMIC</p>
    <p>In ini­tially fac­ing the pan­demic, Asean-wide ef­forts were use­ful. Asean Spe­cial Sum­mits on the pan­demic in April pro­vided sig­nals of high po­lit­i­cal will, show­ing unity within the group and co­op­er­a­tion with ex­ter­nal part­ners. Work­ing-level net­works to ex­change in­for­ma­tion and best prac­tices also helped, such as the Asean Emer­gency Op­er­a­tions Cen­tre Net­work for pub­lic health emer­gen­cies. Asean co­op­er­a­tion fos­ters a base­line of ef­forts and helps main­tain strate­gic bal­ance amid the Sino-Amer­i­can con­flict and pan­demic diplo­macy.</p>
    <p>But while Asean is com­ple­men­tary, the pri­mary re­sponse re­mains with each na­tional gov­ern­ment. Each has acted in dif­fer­ent ways, with di­verse re­sults. Some did rel­a­tively well.</p>
    <p>Viet­nam locked down quickly, re­port­ing low num­bers, and was able to re­open its do­mes­tic econ­omy (al­though it is cur­rently fight­ing a sec­ond wave of in­fec­tions). Oth­ers strug­gle. In­done­sia and the Philip­pines now re­port the highest num­ber of Covid-19 in­fec­tions.</p>
    <p>As re­stric­tions ease, there are also emerg­ing signs of po­lit­i­cal in­sta­bil­ity – not only pol­i­tick­ing be­tween gov­ern­ment and op­po­si­tion but also schisms within gov­ern­ment coali­tions and protests from sec­tors of so­ci­ety. Con­sider Malaysia and Thai­land.</p>
    <p>The pol­i­tics in­ter­twine with eco­nomic dif­fi­cul­ties. Across the re­gion, growth pro­jec­tions have been cut. Asean is pre­dicted to shrink by 2.7 per cent this year, the first con­trac­tion since the Asian Fi­nan­cial Cri­sis back in 1997 and 1998.</p>
    <p>Yet, Asean’s prospects re­main rel­a­tively bright. The United States and the Euro­pean Union will shrink by 6.1 per cent and 9.1 per cent re­spec­tively. Emerg­ing mar­kets, like South Asia and Latin Amer­ica, are se­verely hit, with the num­ber of cases spi­ralling.</p>
    <p>The path ahead will not be easy, but look­ing for re­gional op­por­tu­ni­ties must be a nec­es­sary com­po­nent for Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>RE­CON­NECT­ING</p>
    <p>Our coun­try’s re­gional en­gage­ment has grown from the 1990s, not only po­lit­i­cally but also with sub­stan­tial trade and in­vest­ment. Fly-in and fly-out rou­tines un­der­score not only Changi Air­port’s pas­sen­ger num­bers but also Sin­ga­pore’s role in busi­ness, in­vest­ment, fi­nance and ad­vis­ing across the re­gion.</p>
    <p>This role as a hub did not serve only Sin­ga­porean com­pa­nies. Many multi­na­tional com­pa­nies po­si­tioned them­selves here to serve the re­gion, while hav­ing lit­tle to no busi­ness on the is­land it­self.</p>
    <p>The pan­demic has all but cut off short-stay travel as the usual way of do­ing busi­ness. Some have adapted and “zoomed” around via on­line plat­forms rather than jets. But not all trans­ac­tions are amenable.</p>
    <p>Re­con­nect­ing to the re­gion is, there­fore, a pri­or­ity.</p>
    <p>Even as health pre­cau­tions con­tinue, spe­cial green lane and “travel bub­bles” are be­ing ne­go­ti­ated. Ar­range­ments cov­er­ing six re­gions in China, and with Malaysia, have been agreed. Oth­ers are needed – with both Asean and non-Asean part­ners.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore’s rep­u­ta­tion, re­li­a­bil­ity and trans­parency can of­fer in­creased as­sur­ance for in­com­ing and out­go­ing trav­ellers. Strong test­ing ca­pa­bil­i­ties, sound ad­min­is­tra­tion and en­hanced ca­pa­bil­i­ties to trace con­tacts help peo­ple re­con­nect safely and pro­tect our com­mu­nity against im­ported surges. By such means, Sin­ga­pore can serve as a hub and tran­sit point for es­sen­tial busi­nesses. The more coun­tries we can con­nect with, the greater the rel­e­vance and value gen­er­ated.</p>
    <p>NEW RE­GIONAL STRATE­GIES</p>
    <p>The role of be­ing a hub is chang­ing not only be­cause of the pan­demic but also be­cause of trends al­ready emerg­ing and now ac­cel­er­at­ing, such as the fourth in­dus­trial rev­o­lu­tion. Our coun­try and com­pa­nies must adapt.</p>
    <p>Dig­i­tal ca­pa­bil­i­ties are now an ob­vi­ous must-have. Ac­com­pa­ny­ing this, lo­gis­tics to com­plete the last mile must be more ef­fi­cient and seam­less. Asean-wide dig­i­tal ef­forts started when Sin­ga­pore chaired the group in 2018 and the first Asean On­line Sale Day launched this year is an early ex­am­ple of ef­forts that lie ahead.</p>
    <p>New ca­pa­bil­i­ties are also needed for in-per­son and in-coun­try busi­ness. Rather than be­ing</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore-cen­tric, the need is to lis­ten and re­spond to the eco­nomic pri­or­i­ties of our neigh­bours. One goal es­poused by many coun­tries – es­pe­cially Viet­nam and In­done­sia – is to an­chor and move up global value chains.</p>
    <p>This pos­si­bil­ity has in­creased as Sino-Amer­i­can ten­sions lead more com­pa­nies to move pro­duc­tion outside of China, with some look­ing to our re­gion. But there must be com­ple­men­tary ca­pa­bil­i­ties and strate­gies.</p>
    <p>Plans for the Asean 2025 Vi­sion are cur­rently un­der way, and a mid-term re­view to re­assess pri­or­i­ties should be ac­cel­er­ated by gov­ern­ments. This would bet­ter place the re­gion as a whole to cap­ture global sup­ply chains and re­sist pro­tec­tion­ist voices. Sin­ga­pore as a hub should strongly sup­port eco­nomic in­te­gra­tion so that rel­e­vant parts of the sup­ply chains can be linked back.</p>
    <p>There are some sec­tors where Sin­ga­pore’s ex­pe­ri­ence and ex­per­tise can match what re­gional part­ners need. One is to pro­vide fi­nance as well as ad­vi­sory and le­gal ser­vices. An­other sec­tor is in in­fra­struc­ture, es­pe­cially in trans­port and en­ergy. Sin­ga­pore’s record is strong and its plans for fur­ther de­vel­op­ments in Tuas, Mandai and Changi Air­port will be new ref­er­ence projects – es­pe­cially if these are not only up­scaled but also made more ef­fi­cient, re­silient and sus­tain­able. Agility in ad­ding these ca­pa­bil­i­ties to­gether – to ad­vise, plan, im­ple­ment, fi­nance and gov­ern as flex­i­ble pack­ages – will be an­other key.</p>
    <p>UN­DER­LY­ING AT­TI­TUDES</p>
    <p>These new ca­pa­bil­i­ties must be geared up quickly. Look­ing ahead, prepa­ra­tions are also needed for fu­ture en­gage­ment, and many re­late to un­der­ly­ing at­ti­tudes.</p>
    <p>To con­tinue and deepen as a hub, Sin­ga­pore­ans need to be more knowl­edge­able and at­tuned to the re­gion. Ed­u­cat­ing and equip­ping Sin­ga­pore­ans with skills to be re­gion-ready must be­gin early. The Gov­ern­ment’s Asia-Ready Ex­po­sure Pro­gramme to sup­port stu­dent ex­change pro­grammes to Asean cities, In­dia and China is a good first step.</p>
    <p>Con­versely, train­ing and ed­u­ca­tional op­por­tu­ni­ties are also needed for oth­ers in the re­gion, as they try to move up the value chain. Help­ing our neigh­bours im­prove their skills, whether they are in Sin­ga­pore or in their home coun­try, would be a vivid de­mon­stra­tion of win-win co­op­er­a­tion.</p>
    <p>The com­ing months will be crit­i­cal. Much ef­fort is needed to boost the do­mes­tic econ­omy, in­clud­ing the cre­ation of new jobs. But mov­ing in tan­dem, ways must also be found to re-en­gage the re­gion. Dis­cus­sions in the Emerg­ing Stronger Task­force, or­gan­ised by the Gov­ern­ment, will gain from con­sid­er­ing how to sharpen and hone Sin­ga­pore’s ca­pa­bil­i­ties as a re­gional hub.</p>
    <p>When a storm strikes sud­denly and se­verely, clos­ing the doors is in­stinc­tive. But keep­ing them shut would ruin Asean’s ef­forts to bring the 10 mem­ber coun­tries closer to­gether as a com­mu­nity that is glob­ally com­pet­i­tive and is bad for Sin­ga­pore as a hub. Cau­tion is needed in re­open­ing, but if done cor­rectly, the doors will lead to new hori­zons.</p>
