    <p>Af­ter her hus­band was con­victed of drug-re­lated of­fences in 2016, Sharon (not her real name) felt lost.</p>
    <p>The mother of two knew there were debts to pay. Her chil­dren’s ter­tiary school fees were due soon, and, on top of that, they were an­gry with their father. They even told their mother to leave him.</p>
    <p>But things started turn­ing around for the 50-year-old ad­min­is­tra­tor when she met long-term Yel­low Rib­bon Com­mu­nity Project (YRCP) vol­un­teer Fran­cis Ng.</p>
    <p>When The Straits Times vis­ited the fam­ily’s flat last Thurs­day, Sharon said: “When I faced prob­lems and had ques­tions, he (Mr Ng) was the only one I had at the mo­ment to an­swer them.</p>
    <p>“The first time he came to visit me, you could see his sin­cer­ity. He was try­ing his best. He has a lot of heart and kept calling to check on me and (make sure) I’m fine,” added Sharon, whose hus­band Richard (not his real name) has since fin­ished serv­ing his sen­tence.</p>
    <p>Mr Ng, 63, was at Sharon’s beck and call dur­ing her hus­band’s in­car­cer­a­tion, help­ing her ap­ply for var­i­ous so­cial ser­vice schemes, get­ting the fam­ily su­per­mar­ket vouch­ers, and even writ­ing to the chil­dren’s schools to se­cure bur­saries for them when their fees, which would have to­talled about $13,000 a year, were due.</p>
    <p>Last Satur­day, Mr Ng, who works in the health­care in­dus­try help­ing the el­derly, was one of 30 re­cip­i­ents of the 10-Year Ser­vice Award for his vol­un­teer work with the YRCP.</p>
    <p>Speak­ing at the YRCP Awards and Ap­pre­ci­a­tion cer­e­mony held on­line, Min­is­ter of State for Home Af­fairs and Na­tional Devel­op­ment Muham­mad Faishal Ibrahim thanked the vol­un­teers for their hard work, even amid the Covid-19 pan­demic.</p>
    <p>“Your ef­fort in keep­ing up the en­gage­ment, pro­vid­ing im­me­di­ate sup­port to the fam­i­lies of the of­fend­ers and help­ing them ac­cess gov­ern­ment and com­mu­nity as­sis­tance, is cru­cial to sta­bil­is­ing the fam­ily sit­u­a­tion quickly and min­imis­ing fur­ther dis­rup­tions to their daily lives,” said Dr Faishal.</p>
    <p>The YRCP started in Septem­ber 2010.</p>
    <p>It links trained grassroots vol­un­teers with fam­i­lies of newly ad­mit­ted of­fend­ers to of­fer them sup­port and as­sis­tance by putting them in touch with so­cial sup­port net­works for fi­nan­cial help, as well as pro­vid­ing them with fam­ily sup­port and other wel­fare needs.</p>
    <p>Vol­un­teers will ap­proach fam­i­lies only af­ter con­sent has been given by the of­fend­ers, and they help the fam­i­lies in ar­eas in­clud­ing fi­nance, ed­u­ca­tion, hous­ing and em­ploy­ment.</p>
    <p>As at Oc­to­ber, more than 1,200 vol­un­teers have been trained and have reached out to more than 15,000 fam­i­lies is­land­wide.</p>
    <p>Mr Ng was one of the project’s first vol­un­teers. He and his team reach out to be­tween two and seven fam­i­lies a week.</p>
    <p>When asked what drives him to con­tinue help­ing fam­i­lies, Mr Ng said: “It is some­thing which is very dif­fi­cult to ex­plain and there’re no words that can ac­tu­ally ex­press the sat­is­fac­tion un­til you’ve ex­pe­ri­enced it your­self.</p>
    <p>“Once you help a fam­ily, you can see that af­ter the dis­charge (of the offender), the fam­ily will do very well... so you know you did some­thing which ac­tu­ally helps,” he added.</p>
    <p>As for Richard, he said go­ing home to his wife and chil­dren was “like win­ning the lottery”.</p>
    <p>When asked how he felt about his fam­ily be­ing taken care of while he was serv­ing his sen­tence, he smiled and said he was grate­ful.</p>
