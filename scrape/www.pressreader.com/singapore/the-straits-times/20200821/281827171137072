    <p>When Mr Ren Yushi eats out with his fam­ily, he makes it a point to or­der less, and to min­imise waste, he brings home the left­overs.</p>
    <p>But when it comes to en­ter­tain­ing guests and friends from out of town, the eco­nom­ics lec­turer of­ten or­ders more than they need.</p>
    <p>He does not want them to think him stingy. “When you treat peo­ple you must be gen­er­ous, even if it means you have to go home and eat pick­led veg­eta­bles,” said Mr Ren, 46.</p>
    <p>“We have a tra­di­tion where we be­lieve that be­ing hos­pitable means hav­ing left­overs, if only empty plates re­main then it looks bad on you as a host.”</p>
    <p>This is what Bei­jing is up against with its lat­est “Clean Plate” cam­paign, launched last week by Pres­i­dent Xi Jin­ping, who called on Chi­nese din­ers to stop wast­ing food.</p>
    <p>Call­ing it “shock­ing and dis­tress­ing”, Mr Xi said in com­ments car­ried by the of­fi­cial Peo­ple’s Daily that habits of fru­gal­ity must be cul­ti­vated. To drive home his point, he quoted a Tang Dy­nasty poem: “Who knows that each grain in your bowl, is the fruit of pain and toil”.</p>
    <p>Mr Xi’s call to ac­tion re­flects ris­ing con­cerns over food se­cu­rity, as Bei­jing grap­ples with a trade war, se­vere flood­ing and the Covid-19 pan­demic, which has strained global food pro­duc­tion and sup­ply chains, say ob­servers.</p>
    <p>Food waste is a big is­sue in China. The av­er­age Chi­nese diner throws away 93g of food per meal when eat­ing out, ac­cord­ing to a 2018 study by a Chi­nese re­search in­sti­tute. This is about 11.7 per cent of his meal.</p>
    <p>The Chi­nese leader’s com­ments on not wast­ing food have sparked a flurry of ac­tion over the past week from lo­cal gov­ern­ments, com­pa­nies and restau­rant as­so­ci­a­tions.</p>
    <p>Some like Shanxi prov­ince have di­rected of­fi­cials to or­der “N-1” dishes at of­fi­cial meals, mean­ing one fewer dish than the to­tal num­ber of din­ers, while oth­ers have sent “food waste su­per­vi­sors” to gov­ern­ment-run can­teens.</p>
    <p>Video-shar­ing plat­forms Douyin and Kuaishou have also banned ac­counts that pro­mote binge-eat­ing, while the coun­try’s leg­isla­tive body, the Na­tional Peo­ple’s Congress (NPC), has said it was con­sid­er­ing enacting laws to curb food waste by din­ers.</p>
    <p>This is not the first time Mr Xi has launched such a move­ment. In 2013, he started a sim­i­lar cam­paign which mostly tar­geted ex­trav­a­gant feasts by of­fi­cials.</p>
    <p>But tak­ing aim at the meal ta­bles of 1.4 bil­lion Chi­nese will be a chal­lenge, say ex­perts.</p>
    <p>Pro­fes­sor Hu Xing­dou, a po­lit­i­cal econ­o­mist in Bei­jing, took is­sue with the NPC’s in­tent to en­act laws on food waste, not­ing that it is “rare for a mod­ern, de­vel­oped coun­try to in­ter­fere in peo­ple’s lives in such a man­ner”.</p>
    <p>“Some peo­ple might find this quite laugh­able. If you make laws that you can­not im­ple­ment then peo­ple will stop re­spect­ing the law,” he said.</p>
    <p>Hong Kong-based po­lit­i­cal an­a­lyst Willy Lam noted that many Chi­nese might be look­ing to in­dulge in restau­rant din­ing after months of liv­ing un­der the shadow of Covid-19.</p>
    <p>“Peo­ple will likely go through the mo­tions and maybe or­der less food for a while. In re­al­ity, the state can­not send po­lice of­fi­cers to all restau­rants to mon­i­tor if pa­trons are be­ing fru­gal enough,” said Dr Lam.</p>
    <p>But to Mr Ren and many other</p>
    <p>Chi­nese din­ers, the long-held tra­di­tions of hospi­tal­ity will be the tough­est thing to change.</p>
    <p>“We Chi­nese are not very di­rect, so it’s not nice to ask your guests how much food they can eat. These are all com­plex­i­ties. When treat­ing guests we like to be more gen­er­ous and or­der more,” he said.</p>
