    <p>Covid-19 has re­quired or­gan­i­sa­tions to find new ways to adapt and will pave the way for more in­no­va­tion, said an ex­pert panel dis­cussing the pan­demic’s im­pact on deep tech in­dus­tries yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Pan­el­lists in the vir­tual dis­cus­sion, held dur­ing the Deep Tech Sum­mit that was part of the Sin­ga­pore Fin­Tech Fes­ti­val and Sin­ga­pore Week of In­no­va­tion and Tech­nol­ogy (SFF x Switch 2020), said com­pa­nies must in­no­vate to pre­vent a post-Covid-19 dig­i­tal di­vide, and must train staff to re­duce the threat of pan­demic-re­lated cy­ber se­cu­rity risks.</p>
    <p>Ti­tled Deep Tech For A PostCovid-19 World, the dis­cus­sion fea­tured Agency for Science, Tech­nol­ogy and Re­search chief ex­ec­u­tive of­fi­cer Fred­er­ick Chew, Mi­crosoft gen­eral man­ager Re­nee Lo, and the World Eco­nomic Fo­rum’s head of ar­ti­fi­cial in­tel­li­gence and ma­chine learn­ing Kay Firth-Butterfiel­d. It was or­gan­ised by gov­ern­ment-owned ven­ture firm and deep tech de­vel­oper SGIn­no­vate.</p>
    <p>Deep tech­nolo­gies re­fer to sci­en­tific ad­vance­ments such as ar­ti­fi­cial in­tel­li­gence that, when ap­plied, have far-reaching im­pli­ca­tions across sec­tors.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing an open­ing ad­dress be­fore the dis­cus­sion, SGIn­no­vate CEO Lim Jui called Covid-19 the “chief in­no­va­tion of­fi­cer of the year” on ac­count of how it has changed how com­pa­nies work around the world, in­clud­ing those in deep tech. “(Covid-19 has been) ac­cel­er­at­ing science and tech­nol­ogy,” he said, adding that in­no­va­tions that would nor­mally have taken years have come about in a mat­ter of months.</p>
    <p>Echo­ing this, Ms Firth-Butterfiel­d said the vir­tual na­ture of this year’s SFF x Switch sig­nalled how Covid-19 has ne­ces­si­tated in­no­va­tion and al­lowed for more global con­ver­sa­tions through video­con­fer­enc­ing plat­forms like Zoom.</p>
    <p>“We miss that op­por­tu­nity of just bump­ing into peo­ple and hav­ing good con­ver­sa­tions, but we are en­abled to have con­ver­sa­tions that are ac­tu­ally crit­i­cally im­por­tant about how the world pro­gresses, through these (on­line) me­dia,” she added.</p>
    <p>Ms Lo said Mi­crosoft has ob­served that dig­i­tal­i­sa­tion and in­no­va­tion are tak­ing place now at an ac­cel­er­ated pace. She noted that even firms in in­dus­tries con­sid­ered to be worst af­fected by the pan­demic, such as hos­pi­tal­ity and air­lines, have a re­newed in­ter­est in cre­at­ing new ex­pe­ri­ences for their cus­tomers.</p>
    <p>Mr Chew agreed, adding that com­pa­nies in con­sumer-fac­ing in­dus­tries like eater­ies and re­tail or­gan­i­sa­tions are piv­ot­ing dig­i­tally and try­ing new busi­ness mod­els.</p>
    <p>Ear­lier yes­ter­day in a vir­tual speech dur­ing SFF x Switch, New Zealand Prime Min­is­ter Jacinda Ardern un­der­scored the im­por­tance of en­sur­ing ev­ery sin­gle per­son is equipped to par­tic­i­pate and ben­e­fit from the dig­i­tal econ­omy.</p>
    <p>“Our dig­i­tal fu­ture must pri­ori­tise the well-be­ing of all peo­ple and be truly in­clu­sive. It will be im­por­tant to en­sure that ev­ery sin­gle per­son in busi­ness has what he needs (to) par­tic­i­pate in, contribute to and ben­e­fit from the dig­i­tal econ­omy,” she said.</p>
    <p>The pan­el­lists were also asked about how the pan­demic has af­fected cy­ber se­cu­rity, to which Ms Lo said there have been at­tempts to hack high-pro­file phar­ma­ceu­ti­cal com­pa­nies around the world.</p>
    <p>While tech providers like Mi­crosoft can work on the tech­nol­ogy to bol­ster on­line de­fences with tools like multi-fac­tor au­then­ti­ca­tion and en­cryp­tion, what is more im­por­tant is to make sure peo­ple are con­tin­u­ally trained to have good cy­ber hy­giene and be aware of the dan­gers that lurk on­line, she noted.</p>
    <p>Ms Lo added that hack­ers have been us­ing tac­tics to trick peo­ple into hand­ing over pass­words or even Covid-19 data, by us­ing fake job re­cruit­ing mes­sages or other phish­ing tac­tics. “From a cy­ber se­cu­rity per­spec­tive, we can pro­vide as much as we can, but we also need the dig­i­tal cit­i­zens to be very savvy,” she said.</p>
