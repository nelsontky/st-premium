    <p>LOS AN­GE­LES • A group of celebri­ties, in­clud­ing tennis star Ser­ena Wil­liams and led by Hol­ly­wood ac­tress Natalie Port­man, has founded a women’s pro­fes­sional foot­ball team set to debut in 2022, the Na­tional Women’s Soccer League (NWSL) said on Tues­day.</p>
    <p>Other big names in­volved in the ef­fort com­prise Hol­ly­wood stars Jes­sica Chas­tain, Eva Lon­go­ria, Amer­ica Fer­rera and Jen­nifer Gar­ner.</p>
    <p>“A ma­jor­ity woman-founded group led by Port­man has se­cured the ex­clu­sive right to bring a pro­fes­sional women’s soccer team to Los An­ge­les to kick off in spring 2022,” the NWSL said.</p>
    <p>The team’s for­mal name is yet to be an­nounced, but “the group has for­mally coined it­self ‘An­gel City’ in hon­our of its planned home in</p>
    <p>Los An­ge­les”, the state­ment added.</p>
    <p>It would be­come the 11th team in the NWSL. Cur­rently, there are nine teams in the league, but one other team – Louisville FC – is set to re­join next year.</p>
    <p>The found­ing in­vestor group in­cludes Wil­liams’ young daugh­ter Olympia, and sev­eral former US na­tional team play­ers in­clud­ing Mia Hamm, Lau­ren Hol­i­day and Abby Wam­bach.</p>
    <p>Gam­ing en­tre­pre­neur Julie Uhrman will be the fran­chise pres­i­dent.</p>
    <p>“To­day we take an ex­cit­ing step by an­nounc­ing the first women ma­jor­ity owned and led own­er­ship group,” said Port­man, who won an Os­car in 2011 for her role in Black Swan.</p>
    <p>“Sports are such a joy­ful way to bring peo­ple to­gether, and this has the power to make tan­gi­ble change for fe­male ath­letes both in our com­mu­nity and in the pro­fes­sional sphere.”</p>
    <p>Port­man, who has been ac­tive in causes such as the “Time’s Up” move­ment against sex­ual abuse in the en­ter­tain­ment in­dus­try, said that the fran­chise hopes “to make a sub­stan­tive im­pact on our com­mu­nity, com­mit­ting to ex­tend­ing ac­cess to sports for young peo­ple in Los An­ge­les”.</p>
    <p>The NWSL, which had its in­au­gu­ral sea­son in 2013, was the first US pro­fes­sional sports league to restart ac­tiv­i­ties amid the coro­n­avirus pan­demic.</p>
    <p>The league’s Chal­lenge Cup has been held since June 27, with teams play­ing in two sta­di­ums in the state of Utah without spec­ta­tors and without some of its big­gest stars, in­clud­ing Amer­i­can co-cap­tain Me­gan Rapinoe.</p>
    <p>The tour­na­ment’s fi­nal game is sched­uled for Sun­day.</p>
    <p>The United States is a pow­er­house in women’s foot­ball and the cur­rent World Cup holder.</p>
