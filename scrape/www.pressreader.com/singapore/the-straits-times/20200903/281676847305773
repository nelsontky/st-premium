    <p>De­spite the de­pressed eco­nomic cli­mate amid the Covid-19 pan­demic, there are com­pa­nies that want to set up shop in Sin­ga­pore, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said.</p>
    <p>One of these com­pa­nies is a phar­ma­ceu­ti­cal company that wants to build a fa­cil­ity here to man­u­fac­ture vac­cines, and an­other is a company spe­cial­is­ing in pan­demic risk in­sur­ance, he noted, say­ing dis­cus­sions were still on­go­ing and the com­pa­nies are “hope­fully on the way”.</p>
    <p>“These are all po­ten­tial op­por­tu­ni­ties which are di­rectly com­ing out of the cri­sis,” he said.</p>
    <p>Giv­ing a sneak peek of in­vest­ments in the pipeline, he told Par­lia­ment the Eco­nomic De­vel­op­ment Board and the Mon­e­tary Author­ity of Sin­ga­pore have told him many com­pa­nies have ex­pressed in­ter­est in com­ing to Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>Some other com­pa­nies keen to in­vest here in­clude sev­eral For­tune 500 com­pa­nies that are con­sid­er­ing mov­ing their regional head­quar­ters here, as well as ma­jor fi­nan­cial in­sti­tu­tions that want to grow their op­er­a­tions here – in­clud­ing IT and back­room op­er­a­tions.</p>
    <p>Hyundai Mo­tor has also an</p>
    <p>nounced plans to set up a ma­jor fa­cil­ity in Sin­ga­pore to un­der­take re­search and de­vel­op­ment and de­velop fu­ture mo­bil­ity tech­nolo­gies.</p>
    <p>Amid a world in flux with so­ci­eties un­der stress and pol­i­tics be­com­ing more di­vi­sive, PM Lee said, the com­pa­nies find Sin­ga­pore an at­trac­tive choice. “Com­pa­nies are seek­ing a safe har­bour, where the pol­i­tics is sta­ble, there is rule of law, the peo­ple are hard-work­ing and united, and where the coun­try will come through the pan­demic safely, and have a bright fu­ture,” he added.</p>
    <p>“We take no joy in the trou­bles around the world, but it is a fact that in a trou­bled world, Sin­ga­pore is one of the few trusted coun­tries that stand out. And we must guard that rep­u­ta­tion zeal­ously.”</p>
    <p>He said the com­pa­nies would cre­ate more jobs for Sin­ga­pore­ans, but would need to feel wel­come and</p>
    <p>must be al­lowed to bring in some for­eign tal­ent to fill the po­si­tions that Sin­ga­pore­ans do not yet have the ex­per­tise for. “They will em­ploy Sin­ga­pore­ans too, but they can­not be staffed by Sin­ga­pore­ans alone.”</p>
    <p>Once these global com­pa­nies es­tab­lish them­selves here, Sin­ga­pore­ans will be able to take ad­van­tage of the op­por­tu­ni­ties they bring and pick up skills and knowl­edge from their for­eign col­leagues, he added.</p>
    <p>Not­ing that this is how Sin­ga­pore has al­ways done it, he said phar­ma­ceu­ti­cal com­pa­nies, for ex­am­ple, first be­gan in­vest­ing in Sin­ga­pore some 20 to 30 years ago by build­ing man­u­fac­tur­ing plants, but later set up their regional head­quar­ters and re­search labs here.</p>
    <p>One such company is Glax­oSmithK­line (GSK). PM Lee noted that GSK’s site di­rec­tor is a Sin­ga­porean, Mr Lim Hock Heng, who started in 1992 as a pro­duc­tion en­gi­neer, picked up skills and knowl­edge from his for­eign col­leagues, and rose through the ranks.</p>
    <p>Now, Mr Lim, 59, over­sees the phar­ma­ceu­ti­cal giant’s Sin­ga­pore sites, which man­u­fac­ture key prod­ucts for the whole world.</p>
    <p>Some global banks too had helped to groom Sin­ga­pore­ans as the coun­try looked to grow its fi­nan­cial sec­tor af­ter a ma­jor re­ces­sion in the 1980s, said PM Lee.</p>
    <p>Citibank, for in­stance, had hired Sin­ga­pore­ans even though it had thou­sands of staff from around the world to choose from.</p>
    <p>That was how Ms Su­san Kwek, then a diploma holder in com­puter science, got her start in the in­dus­try. She went on to hold op­er­a­tions and tech­nol­ogy roles and now, at 58, over­sees op­er­a­tions and tech­nol­ogy in Citi Hong Kong.</p>
    <p>She told The Straits Times that the op­por­tu­ni­ties and in­ter­na­tional ex­po­sure she got on the job had al­lowed her to con­stantly up­grade her skills and ex­pand her net­work be­yond Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>In his speech, PM Lee said many more com­pa­nies i n the semi­con­duc­tor, oil and gas, and in­for­ma­tion tech­nol­ogy sec­tors have sim­i­larly groomed Sin­ga­pore­ans and put them in se­nior roles.</p>
    <p>He asked MPs: “If we had not wel­comed these com­pa­nies in the past and en­cour­aged them to bring in global tal­ent, Hock Heng, Su­san and oth­ers would have been de­prived of these op­por­tu­ni­ties. Would we have been bet­ter off?”</p>
