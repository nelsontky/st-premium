    <p>PARIS • No­vak Djokovic shrugged off con­cerns of Rafael Nadal and Roger Fed­erer and an­nounced the for­ma­tion of a new men’s pro ten­nis play­ers’ as­so­ci­a­tion that prom­ises to put him on a col­li­sion course with his two elite ri­vals.</p>
    <p>Nadal and Fed­erer called for “unity, not sep­a­ra­tion” af­ter re­ports Djokovic was spear­head­ing a break­away union of ten­nis pro­fes­sion­als.</p>
    <p>But, af­ter a meet­ing among play­ers at the con­clu­sion of the Western & South­ern Open in New York, Djokovic re­vealed the launch of the new group.</p>
    <p>“Af­ter to­day’s suc­cess­ful meet­ing, we are ex­cited to an­nounce the be­gin­ning of the Pro­fes­sional Ten­nis Play­ers As­so­ci­a­tion (PTPA),” he wrote on In­sta­gram, post­ing a pic­ture of sev­eral dozen play­ers gath­ered on a ten­nis court at Flush­ing</p>
    <p>Mead­ows. “The first player only as­so­ci­a­tion in ten­nis since 1972.”</p>
    <p>Djokovic had ac­knowl­edged af­ter his vic­tory over Mi­los Raonic in Saturday’s As­so­ci­a­tion of Ten­nis Pro­fes­sion­als (ATP) fi­nal that the group was a work in progress.</p>
    <p>“We don’t have all the answers right now. We are just try­ing to get a sense of how many play­ers do re­ally want to join this ini­tia­tive. Then we will take it from there,” he said.</p>
    <p>He also said there was no min­i­mum or max­i­mum tar­get mem­ber­ship, but that he was fo­cus­ing on reach­ing out to the top 500 play­ers in sin­gles and top 200 in dou­bles.</p>
    <p>The Serb in­sisted the new or­gan­i­sa­tion and the ATP “can co-ex­ist”, and should do so at the be­gin­ning.</p>
    <p>Nadal had pleaded with Djokovic, who has re­signed from his po­si­tion as the pres­i­dent of the ATP Player Coun­cil, to re­think a break­away.</p>
    <p>“The world is liv­ing a dif­fi­cult and com­pli­cated sit­u­a­tion. I per­son­ally be­lieve these are times to be calm and work all of us to­gether in the same direc­tion. It is time for unity, not for sep­a­ra­tion,” he said.</p>
    <p>Fed­erer quickly added his sup­port to Nadal.</p>
    <p>“I agree @RafaelNada­l,” tweeted Fed­erer. “These are un­cer­tain and chal­leng­ing times, but I be­lieve it’s crit­i­cal for us to stand united as play­ers, and as a sport, to pave the best way for­ward.”</p>
    <p>Former world No. 1 Andy Mur­ray is also cur­rently not in favour of a break­away group and has urged fel­low play­ers to give the gov­ern­ing body time to tackle their con­cerns.</p>
    <p>“I’m not to­tally against a player union, player as­so­ci­a­tion,” he said.</p>
    <p>“But right now there’s a couple of things: One is I feel like the cur­rent man­age­ment that are in place should be given some time to im­ple­ment their vi­sion.</p>
    <p>“Whether that works out, or not, would po­ten­tially in­flu­ence me in the fu­ture as to which way I would go.”</p>
