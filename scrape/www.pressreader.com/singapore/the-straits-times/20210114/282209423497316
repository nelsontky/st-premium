        <p>Ride-hail­ing firm Uber will have to pay a $6.58 mil­lion penalty af­ter its ap­peal against a 2018 de­ci­sion that it had breached com­pe­ti­tion laws here was dis­missed.</p>
        <p>An ap­peal board chaired by se­nior coun­sel An­dre Yeap up­held the fine and other mea­sures im­posed by the Com­pe­ti­tion and Con­sumer Com­mis­sion of Sin­ga­pore (CCCS), which had found that Grab and Uber’s merger in March 2018 was anti-com­pet­i­tive.</p>
        <p>The board, which is­sued its de­ci­sion on Dec 29, also or­dered Uber to pay CCCS’ costs for the ap­peal. In its de­ci­sion pub­lished yes­ter­day, it said it was per­suaded that Grab and Uber must have been aware that the merger would have re­stricted com­pe­ti­tion.</p>
        <p>Uber had sold its South­east­Asian business to Grab for a 27.5 per cent stake in Grab. Be­fore then, the firms had a com­bined mar­ket share here that was more than five times the next big­gest player, Com­fortDelGro, and the deal would have crossed thresh­olds in­di­cat­ing po­ten­tial com­pe­ti­tion con­cerns, the board said.</p>
        <p>Uber had sought to set aside the CCCS’s 2018 ver­dict or re­duce the penalty im­posed.</p>
        <p>Af­ter a six-month in­ves­ti­ga­tion, the com­mis­sion had ruled in Septem­ber 2018 that the Grab-Uber deal re­duced mar­ket com­pe­ti­tion and re­sulted in Grab get­ting an 80 per cent share of Sin­ga­pore’s ride­hail­ing mar­ket, up from 50 per cent pre­vi­ously.</p>
        <p>Not­ing then that it was too late to un­wind the deal, the com­mis­sion spelt out a se­ries of mea­sures to cush­ion the im­pact on com­muters, driv­ers and po­ten­tial com­peti­tors.</p>
        <p>This in­cluded re­quir­ing Grab to re­move ex­clu­siv­ity ar­range­ments with taxi fleets and driv­ers, as well as main­tain its pre-merger pric­ing al­go­rithm and driver com­mis­sion rates. Grab did not ap­peal and paid a $6.4 mil­lion fine.</p>
        <p>But Uber fought the ver­dict as “a mat­ter of prin­ci­ple”. In its sub­mis­sions, the firm ar­gued that it did not flout anti-com­pe­ti­tion laws in­ten­tion­ally or neg­li­gently, nor did the merger lead to a sub­stan­tial less­en­ing of com­pe­ti­tion, es­pe­cially in the light of Go­jek’s en­try into the mar­ket later that year.</p>
        <p>But the ap­peal board agreed with the CCCS, not­ing that with­out the mea­sures im­posed, the Grab-Uber deal would have al­lowed Grab to re­quest Uber not to sell its car rental arm Lion City Rentals to another party. Grab would also have had the abil­ity and in­cen­tive to re­in­force its po­si­tion by en­ter­ing into ex­clu­siv­ity ar­range­ments.</p>
        <p>It said Go­jek’s en­try was not of suf­fi­cient scope to con­strain Grab, not­ing Grab had deeper pock­ets and would have been able to in­vest more heav­ily to main­tain its com­pet­i­tive ad­van­tage post-merger, pos­ing a sig­nif­i­cant bar­rier to en­try.</p>
        <p>It pointed to in­ter­nal pa­pers and es­ti­mates from Uber and Grab in­di­cat­ing they had ex­pected the deal to in­crease Grab’s abil­ity to raise prices. This hap­pened in the wake of the merger and even af­ter Go­jek’s en­try. There had also been a sig­nif­i­cant cut in pro­mo­tions and in­cen­tives, and post-merger data did not show Go­jek’s en­try re­stored com­pe­ti­tion to pre-merger lev­els.</p>
        <p>CCCS chief ex­ec­u­tive Sia Aik Kor said the board’s de­ci­sion re­in­forced the mes­sage that merg­ers which sub­stan­tially lessen com­pe­ti­tion in Sin­ga­pore are pro­hib­ited.</p>
        <p>She said: “Sin­ga­pore’s vol­un­tary no­ti­fi­ca­tion merger regime aims to strike a bal­ance be­tween safe­guard­ing com­pe­ti­tion and be­ing probusi­ness... Should CCCS have rea­son­able grounds to sus­pect that an anti-com­pet­i­tive merger has been com­pleted or is an­tic­i­pated, it is em­pow­ered to in­ves­ti­gate and take ap­pro­pri­ate en­force­ment ac­tion.”</p>
        <p>Uber has un­til Jan 26 to ap­peal to the High Court on spe­cific points of law or the amount it needs to pay.</p>
