    <p>A funny thing hap­pened just be­fore Christ­mas Eve – there was a mini-furore in the nor­mally quiet Eurasian com­mu­nity.</p>
    <p>Old Chang Kee an­nounced that it was go­ing to launch a Devil’s Curry’O puff, which was based on the Eurasian com­mu­nity’s clas­sic curry devil dish, on Box­ing Day. Even be­fore tast­ing it, a few Eurasians were not happy at this de­vel­op­ment.</p>
    <p>Devil’s curry is a mis­nomer for “curry de­bal”. Even though we are not quite sure which lan­guage it comes from, the word “de­bal” means “left­overs”.</p>
    <p>For hun­dreds of years, the Eurasians of Malaya in Malacca, Pe­nang and Sin­ga­pore would make a curry us­ing all the left­overs, such as sausages, chicken, turkey, pork or what­ever else was on the Christ­mas Day lunch or din­ner menu.</p>
    <p>Curry de­bal re­mains unique in that it is prob­a­bly one of the few cur­ries that have vine­gar added to the gravy, os­ten­si­bly to pre­serve the left­overs.</p>
    <p>Curry de­bal has been and re­mains a tra­di­tion for Eurasian fam­i­lies as a Box­ing Day treat. How­ever, its pop­u­lar­ity has tran­scended the Eurasian com­mu­nity, and it is com­mer­cially avail­able at sev­eral food out­lets across Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>Thanks to the Bri­tish dur­ing colo­nial times, and prob­a­bly also due to the cre­ativ­ity of the Eurasians, curry de­bal some­how be­came an­gli­cised as curry “devil”.</p>
    <p>After that, there was an ur­ban myth that the curry was so spicy that it was as hot as hell, and the name mor­phed once again, into “devil’s curry”.</p>
    <p>Old Chang Kee had pre­vi­ously ex­per­i­mented with other fill­ings for its curry puffs, in­clud­ing a nasi lemak puff in 2018. Re­mem­ber that one? The pas­try was co­conut green.</p>
    <p>I do not re­mem­ber any­one kick­ing up a fuss back then. How­ever, the Devil’s Curry’O puff trig­gered ac­cu­sa­tions of cul­tural ap­pro­pri­a­tion.</p>
    <p>The Eurasian As­so­ci­a­tion’s (EA) Face­book page posted Old Chang Kee’s an­nounce­ment of the Devil’s Curry’O with a sim­ple cap­tion: “Thoughts?”</p>
    <p>A few comments were less than di­plo­matic.</p>
    <p>“Curry de­bal or curry devil, not devil’s curry. Who is the id­iot that came up with this? Vine­gar-in­spired???”</p>
    <p>“Well if you are not up­set see­ing this head­line then some­thing is re­ally wrong!</p>
    <p>“I hope EA pro­motes its food cul­ture via au­then­tic Eurasian busi­nesses try­ing to bring the real taste of its cui­sine to Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>“Surely fran­chises can­not repli­cate tra­di­tional recipes handed down through the gen­er­a­tions. Its Eurasian-in­spired ver­sion will in fact do dam­age to a truly Eurasian her­itage dish that we as</p>
    <p>Eurasian can all as­so­ci­ate with.</p>
    <p>“Coun­ter­feit Old Chang Kee De­bal Curry Puff will never be the Real Thing pro­duced by sev­eral Eurasian food providers.”</p>
    <p>Two oth­ers com­mented that if one re­ally wanted an au­then­tic devil’s curry puff, they should go to the few Eurasian en­ter­prises that sup­plied these.</p>
    <p>Not ev­ery­one was neg­a­tive; one said she thought Old Chang Kee “wanted to recog­nise the Eurasian com­mu­nity and its con­tri­bu­tion to Sin­ga­pore’s food her­itage”.</p>
    <p>It might all be a storm in a teacup, but to some, this seemed like a case of “cul­tural ap­pro­pri­a­tion”.</p>
    <p>Cul­tural ap­pro­pri­a­tion is a term used to de­scribe el­e­ments of one cul­ture or iden­tity be­ing adopted by mem­bers of an­other cul­ture or iden­tity. This be­comes con­tro­ver­sial when mem­bers of a dom­i­nant cul­ture ap­pro­pri­ate from dis­ad­van­taged mi­nor­ity cul­tures.</p>
    <p>Ex­am­ples of this in­clude ap­pro­pri­at­ing el­e­ments for profit or for “en­ter­tain­ment”. Many pop artists have been called out for in­cor­po­rat­ing In­dian wed­ding dances or el­e­ments of black cul­ture in their acts. Worse still is when such bor­row­ing of cul­tural el­e­ments is done “as a joke” and leads to the den­i­gra­tion of the orig­i­nal cul­ture.</p>
    <p>Cul­tural ap­pro­pri­a­tion re­in­forces sweep­ing stereo­types about a par­tic­u­lar cul­ture; for in­stance, that all Ja­panese women wear ki­monos and paint their faces like geisha do.</p>
    <p>In the case of the curry puff, is Old Chang Kee ap­pro­pri­at­ing Eurasian cul­ture – that is, us­ing it for com­mer­cial gain, mak­ing fun of or mis­rep­re­sent­ing Eurasian cul­ture – or might this be just a show of ap­pre­ci­a­tion for Eurasian her­itage, and a cel­e­bra­tion of Sin­ga­pore’s mul­tira­cial and mul­ti­cul­tural tra­di­tions?</p>
    <p>After all, Old Chang Kee did note in its mar­ket­ing ma­te­rial that its puff cre­ation is Eurasian- and Box­ing Day-in­spired.</p>
    <p>I do not think Old Chang Kee in­tended to in­sult the Eurasian com­mu­nity but was rather mak­ing the most of a mar­ket­ing op­por­tu­nity for fes­ti­val-themed pro­mos, like it has done be­fore.</p>
    <p>For in­stance, to mark Na­tional Day in Au­gust, it came up with four flavours rep­re­sent­ing the dif­fer­ent races – Chilli Crab (Chi­nese), Ren­dang Chicken (Malay), But­ter Chicken (In­dian) and Chicken Stew (Eurasian).</p>
    <p>In any case, it is only fair to first give the Devil’s Curry’O puff a try. If it fails to pass muster, then vote with your feet (or more ac­cu­rately, your stom­ach) and never go back for an­other.</p>
    <p>Then, per­haps, it might lead to Old Chang Kee link­ing up with Eurasian chefs and en­ter­prises to col­lab­o­rate on a more au­then­tic ver­sion called curry de­bal puff.</p>
    <p>I do hope that ul­ti­mately we can live and let live, be less thin-skinned and more for­giv­ing. Not ev­ery­thing is cul­tural ap­pro­pri­a­tion and needs to be greeted by ou­trage. The world can be a calmer and more peace­ful place.</p>
