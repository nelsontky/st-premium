    <p>For a Sin­ga­pore film in which plenty of English is used, you will not find much Singlish in the com­edy-drama Tiong Bahru So­cial Club.</p>
    <p>“Orh”, how­ever, has a spe­cial place in it.</p>
    <p>The word, which means “I hear you” or “mes­sage re­ceived”, was put in by screen­writer Antti Toivo­nen, 42, a Finn who has lived here for over a decade.</p>
    <p>In one comic i nter­ac­tion be­tween the main char­ac­ter Ah Bee (Thomas Pang) and the ar­ti­fi­cial in­tel­li­gence that runs his home, he makes the “orh” noise. The com­puter, pro­grammed to seek novel phrases, re­peats the strange new sound and adds it to its lex­i­con.</p>
    <p>“It’s such an in­ter­est­ing Sin­ga­porean ex­pres­sion. I’m fascinated by ‘orh’,” says Toivo­nen.</p>
    <p>He and di­rec­tor and co­screen­writer Tan Bee Thiam spoke to The Straits Times last week over Zoom from their homes.</p>
    <p>Tiong Bahru So­cial Club, which opens in cin­e­mas to­day, is the first ma­jor-re­lease Sin­ga­pore film to have large chunks of English dia­logue in re­cent years.</p>
    <p>Af­ter a brief flow­er­ing about a decade ago, the lan­guage is to­day shunned by prom­i­nent film­mak­ers here for com­mer­cial, artis­tic and emo­tional rea­sons.</p>
    <p>Tan and Toivo­nen say they paid less at­ten­tion to the pit­falls of couch­ing the film in English than how best to present an ac­cu­rate pic­ture of a poly­glot so­ci­ety.</p>
    <p>Tan, 42, says: “The film is about 50 to 60 per cent in English. We wanted a mul­tira­cial cast. We had the younger char­ac­ters speak to each other in English.”</p>
    <p>But when they speak to older char­ac­ters, they switch to Tamil, Malay, Man­darin or Can­tonese.</p>
    <p>Af­ter all, the film is about a cor­po­rate-run club, where young and old are ruled by com­puter al­go­rithms de­signed to max­imise hap­pi­ness. It is a satire of mod­ern life, one that aims to en­ter­tain as much as pro­voke thought, say the film­mak­ers.</p>
    <p>Set in a retro-fu­tur­is­tic re­al­ity framed by the curvy shapes of Tiong Bahru’s low-rise apart­ment blocks, the story fol­lows Ah Bee, a young man fed up with his job. Seek­ing a new start, he joins the Tiong Bahru So­cial Club.</p>
    <p>Res­i­dents are mon­i­tored night</p>
    <p>and day, with their emo­tional re­sponses charted to see if they meet hap­pi­ness goals.</p>
    <p>To get the right look, Tan and his team in­vested in a colour­co­or­di­nated wardrobe for cast mem­bers play­ing hap­pi­ness agents, em­ployed to cre­ate hap­pi­ness for res­i­dents. They also made sure the set was free from any­thing that could ground the story in a par­tic­u­lar time pe­riod.</p>
    <p>Tan says: “There are no mo­bile phones, no cars, no com­put­ers. The only screen there is an old tele­vi­sion set in a home at the Pearl Bank Apart­ments.”</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore­ans who recog­nise the high-rise pri­vate res­i­den­tial build</p>
    <p>ing and icon of bru­tal­ist ar­chi­tec­ture lo­cated close to Chi­na­town might feel a pang know­ing it was torn down ear­lier this year. But over­seas view­ers also re­sponded to its unique looks.</p>
    <p>The film, se­lected to open this year’s Sin­ga­pore In­ter­na­tional Film Fes­ti­val that ran from Nov 26 to Dec 6, was also screened at the Golden Horse Film Fes­ti­val in Taipei on Nov 7.</p>
    <p>“Au­di­ences in Taipei were taken by how strik­ing Pearl Bank looked and I had to tell them it’s no longer there,” Tan says.</p>
    <p>As for the cast, sev­eral ac­tors, such as Pang and ac­tresses Jo Tan and Ja­lyn Han, come with years of</p>
    <p>theatre ex­pe­ri­ence, but were picked be­cause of their ex­pe­ri­ence as ac­tors, Tan notes.</p>
    <p>Ah Bee, for ex­am­ple, is a man of few words and Pang’s train­ing gave him the tools to ex­press him­self word­lessly.</p>
    <p>“He’d come in one hour be­fore the shoot to do body ex­er­cises. Each time we had a re­take, he’d have a new in­ter­pre­ta­tion,” Tan says.</p>
    <p>Han, 58, plays Ms Wee, a res­i­dent whom Ah Bee cares for as part of his du­ties at the club.</p>
    <p>The vet­eran of Chi­nese-lan­guage theatre was asked to have her char­ac­ter speak a di­alect, so she rat­tled off lines in Hainanese,</p>
    <p>Teochew, Hokkien and Can­tonese.</p>
    <p>Can­tonese was picked as Tan liked the sound of it for her char­ac­ter, she tells ST in a sep­a­rate Zoom call.</p>
    <p>Ms Wee is an ec­cen­tric who makes Ah Bee ques­tion the premises of the club. To play her, Han says she re­lied on mem­o­ries of her younger days liv­ing in Sem­bawang, which she calls “a very drama place” – high in crime and full of colour­ful peo­ple, such as a woman Han dubs Liu San Jie (third sis­ter Liu).</p>
    <p>“She had men­tal prob­lems, but she was clean and well-dressed and used to sit out­side the cin­ema ev­ery night,” the ac­tress re­calls.</p>
    <p>No one in the film is poor or an out­cast, or caught in a tragic dilemma. It bucks the trend of Sin­ga­pore in­die works that find drama in the plight of the marginalis­ed seek­ing redemp­tion in void decks and con­struc­tion sites.</p>
    <p>Tan notes: “We didn’t want to make some­thing that was not a so­cial re­al­ist film. We thought it was im­por­tant to make some­thing that gives hope, that gives us pos­si­bil­i­ties. I’m in­ter­ested in look­ing at the fu­ture.”</p>
