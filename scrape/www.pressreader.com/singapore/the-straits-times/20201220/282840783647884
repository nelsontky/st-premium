    <p>Noth­ing stays the same in sport nor should it, for tastes evolve. Once the de­cath­lete – as King Gustaf V of Swe­den told Jim Thorpe, the 1912 cham­pion – was “the great­est ath­lete in the world”. Now the win­ner is a quiz ques­tion.</p>
    <p>In 2024 when break­dancers pack their funky clothes for the Paris Olympics they should re­mem­ber to carry some hu­mil­ity. This city isn’t easy to im­press. When croquet made its Games de­but in 1900, Parisians turned up their haughty col­lars. Only a sin­gle en­try ticket was sold. To an English­man.</p>
    <p>Croquet dis­ap­peared and so did mo­tor-boat­ing and the javelin thrown with both hands. Weird stuff hap­pens at this four-yearly five-ring cir­cus, so don’t sneer at break­danc­ing. At this grand Games, Dar­win’s law of the fittest ap­plies to ev­ery­one: Both athletes and sports are fight­ing for a place.</p>
    <p>Ev­ery sport be­lieves the Olympics need it. Weightlift­ing will in­sist it has the heft of tra­di­tion and sports climb­ing will claim it is the height of cool. Very few, like ath­let­ics and swim­ming, are ir­re­place­able, but even here a lit­tle trim­ming hap­pens. The 60m sprint was briefly an Olympic event be­fore it was ex­cluded. Else imag­ine Usain Bolt’s haul of golds.</p>
    <p>Some sports make cameos at the Olympics but never as­sume a star­ring role. Cricket showed up in Paris 1900 and was de­scribed – as The Com­plete Book Of the Olympics re­counts – by a French mag­a­zine as “a sport which ap­pears mo­not­o­nous and with­out colour to the unini­ti­ated”. Quickly it was run out of the Games.</p>
    <p>Golf was luck­ier. Played in 1900 and 1904, when some fe­male com­peti­tors mis­tak­enly turned up in high heels, it made a come­back in 2016. In­deed, if you want to get into the Games it helps if you have a Marvel comic hero-equiv­a­lent as your best player. As a golf ad­min­is­tra­tor told the New York Times, “The very first ques­tion (asked by Olympic of­fi­cials) was, ‘Will Tiger Woods play?’ ”</p>
    <p>Yet no one is en­tirely sure why a sport gets in, goes or stays. Mod­ern pen­tathlon, an un­likely mix of rid­ing and run­ning, sur­vives one pre­sumes be­cause it was cre­ated by the fa­ther of the Games, Baron Pierre de Cou­bertin. The event, said the Baron, is a re­flec­tion of “a man’s moral qual­i­ties as much as his phys­i­cal re­sources and skills, pro­duc­ing thereby a com­plete ath­lete.” Yes, if only any­one could re­mem­ber their names.</p>
    <p>“To be on the Olympic pro­gramme,” said for­mer In­ter­na­tional Olympic Com­mit­tee boss Jac­ques Rogge once, “is an is­sue where you need uni­ver­sal­ity as much as pos­si­ble.” Pop­u­lar­ity is the most se­duc­tive ar­gu­ment and even Olympic bosses can’t re­sist it. The Games can’t just be a gath­er­ing of the fastest, high­est, strong­est but also the most de­sired and ad­mired.</p>
    <p>And so ten­nis re­turned in 1988 be­cause what was a Games with­out St­effi Graf? Olympic bas­ket­ball let in NBA play­ers in 1992 and for its wis­dom was treated to the Dream Team. This April, Michael Jor­dan’s jer­sey from that Barcelona sum­mer sold for a mod­est US$216,000 (S$286,921).</p>
    <p>Noth­ing stays the same in sport nor should it, for tastes evolve. Once the de­cath­lete – as King Gustaf V of Swe­den told Jim Thorpe, the 1912 cham­pion – was “the great­est ath­lete in the world”. Now the win­ner is a quiz ques­tion.</p>
    <p>His­tory plays a part in change and ge­og­ra­phy has a role. The</p>
    <p>West lob­bies for its own sports and the East – bad­minton was ad­mit­ted in 1992 – pur­sues its own agenda. No one, alas, in any hemi­sphere loves squash enough.</p>
    <p>Sports need the Games be­cause recog­ni­tion leads to fund­ing.</p>
    <p>Na­tions love chas­ing medals and so as­so­ci­a­tions are set up, rock walls con­structed and skate­board sales rise. If break­dance coaches need to be sourced, any­one from the 1980s could ap­ply.</p>
    <p>Ev­ery­one tin­kers in sport, athletes with tech­nique and of­fi­cials with events. Not ev­ery­thing turns out to be a good idea. One Olympics in­cluded duelling pis­tols, which in­volved shoot­ing at a dummy in a frock coat with a tar­get on his chest. Eques­trian once had a long jump and a high jump, but none of it lasted. Well, tram­po­line has, for rea­sons un­known.</p>
    <p>The Olympics have to change, cut, ex­per­i­ment be­cause no move­ment wishes to be ir­rel­e­vant. At­ten­tion spans are al­ter­ing and events must tailor them­selves ac­cord­ingly. Wim­ble­don may yet be all white, yet it in­tro­duced a tie-breaker. The Olympics sim­i­larly have old-fash­ioned wrestling but must make space for break­danc­ing.</p>
    <p>This new sport might seem be­wil­der­ing to some, yet th­ese Games are merely com­plet­ing an an­cient cy­cle. Art lies in their ori­gins and from 1912 to 1948 gold medals were awarded for ar­chi­tec­ture, lit­er­a­ture, mu­sic, paint­ing and sculp­ture.</p>
    <p>So be a sport. And give dance a break.</p>
