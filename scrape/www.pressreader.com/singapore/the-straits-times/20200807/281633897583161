    <p>Al­most all of the 323,000 for­eign work­ers stay­ing in dor­mi­to­ries would have been tested for Covid-19 by to­day, and about 90 per cent of them can go back to work by the end of this month.</p>
    <p>This means that many con­struc­tion ac­tiv­i­ties and projects should be able to re­sume soon, said Ed­u­ca­tion Min­is­ter Lawrence Wong yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>But with a num­ber of work­ers still in iso­la­tion fa­cil­i­ties, the daily num­ber of Covid-19 cases will fluc­tu­ate in the next two weeks as they are tested.</p>
    <p>Mr Wong, who co-chairs the pandemic task force, said the au­thor­i­ties are try­ing to speed up the process to let work­ers cleared of Covid-19 re­turn to work quickly.</p>
    <p>“We are not only clear­ing the work­ers in the dor­mi­to­ries and mak­ing sure that they are safe, but we also want them to get back to work as soon as pos­si­ble,” said Mr Wong who, un­til a re­cent Cab­i­net reshuf­fle, was the Min­is­ter for Na­tional De­vel­op­ment.</p>
    <p>“We do ex­pect the vast ma­jor­ity to be able to do so by the end of this month,” he added.</p>
    <p>He urged em­ploy­ers and con­trac­tors to do their part be­fore the work­ers re­turn by start­ing prepa­ra­tions to im­ple­ment the nec­es­sary safety mea­sures as soon as pos­si­ble.</p>
    <p>Among other things, em­ploy­ers have to pro­vide ded­i­cated trans­port be­tween work­sites and places of ac­com­mo­da­tion, with work­sites de­ploy­ing sys­tems such as TraceTo­gether and SafeEn­try to en­sure track­ing and com­pli­ance.</p>
    <p>In ad­di­tion, the hous­ing ar­range­ments are likely to be dif­fer­ent.</p>
    <p>The task force wants work­ers from the same em­ploy­ers to be housed to­gether for bet­ter man­age­ment, in­stead of be­ing dis­persed in dif­fer­ent blocks.</p>
    <p>Mr Wong said the au­thor­i­ties will work with em­ploy­ers and con­trac­tors to en­sure con­struc­tion and other high-risk ac­tiv­i­ties will be done in a safe man­ner.</p>
    <p>He also said all work­ers liv­ing in dor­mi­to­ries will un­dergo Covid-19 tests ev­ery 14 days.</p>
    <p>“If through rou­tine test­ing we pick up one case, the in­ten­tion is to go in very quickly, iso­late the work­ers per­haps within the room or the en­tire floor even, so that you can pull out the work­ers who are at risk,” he added.</p>
    <p>This would help pre­vent the need for a lock­down of an en­tire af­fected block or even dor­mi­tory, he said.</p>
    <p>Other meth­ods to com­ple­ment reg­u­lar test­ing in­clude mon­i­tor­ing of waste­water for the virus.</p>
    <p>“With all these new mea­sures, we hope we can pre-empt, we can iden­tify early, and we can al­low con­struc­tion work, in par­tic­u­lar, to re­sume safely with­out t he risk of large clus­ters form­ing,” Mr Wong added.</p>
    <p>On the fi­nal batch of work­ers in iso­la­tion who are wait­ing to be tested for Covid-19, he had said last month that 28,000 work­ers will still be iso­lated i n stand­alone blocks in dor­mi­to­ries that serve as quar­an­tine fa­cil­i­ties.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, the task force said there is a chance of a high rate of in­fec­tions among this fi­nal batch of work­ers, which could lead to a surge in Covid-19 cases.</p>
    <p>The Min­istry of Health’s direc­tor of med­i­cal ser­vices Ken­neth Mak said the task force is work­ing with the Man­power Min­istry on how to con­tinue sup­port­ing the work­ers, even af­ter the out­break in dor­mi­to­ries is brought un­der con­trol.</p>
    <p>One way he cited is through telemedici­ne. “We will be look­ing to­wards es­tab­lish­ing more longterm med­i­cal fa­cil­i­ties ded­i­cated to sup­port­ing the health of mi­grant work­ers,” he added.</p>
    <p>“These may in­clude a com­bi­na­tion of med­i­cal posts or med­i­cal cen­tres ei­ther on site or close to the dor­mi­to­ries.”</p>
