    <p>Kiss92 FM ra­dio pre­sen­ter</p>
    <p>He is also the founder of film com­pany Sto­ry­teller Pro­duc­tions and so­cial move­ment We Are Ma­ju­lah.</p>
    <p>I was from: Catholic High School (2000 to 2003).</p>
    <p>My best school mem­o­ries:</p>
    <p>“Iron­i­cally, I think they came from spend­ing time with my friends out of school.</p>
    <p>“There was just some­thing about the care­free na­ture of our con­ver­sa­tions and the in­vest­ment we had in our games and ex­per­i­ments, es­pe­cially dur­ing the school hol­i­days. It was not out of the or­di­nary for us to skate­board and play guitar from 7am to 11pm.”</p>
    <p>One key les­son I’ve learnt: “Mr</p>
    <p>Lim Tow Wee was one of the most quick-wit­ted and charis­matic teach­ers I’ve ever had. I re­mem­ber telling him once that be­ing mixed race in an all-Chi­nese school was dif­fi­cult be­cause I felt dif­fer­ent.</p>
    <p>“The next day, he made me one of the main ac­tors for a Chi­nese play. I was ter­ri­fied. Af­ter three months of con­sis­tent prac­tice and anx­i­ety, I stepped on stage and spoke more Chi­nese than I ever had in my en­tire life.</p>
    <p>“For 50 min­utes, I faced my fears of be­ing an out­sider. The play ended with a stand­ing ova­tion and a les­son learnt. If you un­der­stand your weak­ness, there is po­ten­tial for you to take ad­van­tage of it and turn it into a strength.”</p>
    <p>If I were a stu­dent again: “In the year 2000, I would’ve told my par­ents to in­vest in Ap­ple shares.”</p>

        <p data-role="text">As a stu&#xAD;dent, Divian Nair felt awk&#xAD;ward about be&#xAD;ing mixed race in an all-Chi&#xAD;nese school so his teacher made him one of the main ac&#xAD;tors in a Chi&#xAD;nese play to boost his con&#xAD;fi&#xAD;dence.</p>
