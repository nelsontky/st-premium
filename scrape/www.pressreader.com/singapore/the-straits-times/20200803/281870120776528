    <p>WASHINGTON • Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump will take ac­tion shortly on Chi­nese soft­ware com­pa­nies that are feed­ing data di­rectly to the Bei­jing gov­ern­ment, pos­ing a risk to US na­tional se­cu­rity, Sec­re­tary of State Mike Pom­peo said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>“Pres­i­dent Trump has said ‘enough’ and we’re go­ing to fix it and so he will take ac­tion in the com­ing days with re­spect to a broad ar­ray of na­tional se­cu­rity risks that are pre­sented by soft­ware con­nected to the Chi­nese Com­mu­nist Party,” Mr Pom­peo told Fox News Chan­nel’s Sun­day Morn­ing Fu­tures.</p>
    <p>Mr Pom­peo made the com­ments amid ex­pec­ta­tions that the Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion would soon pre­vent Chi­nese-owned Tik­Tok, a wildly pop­u­lar mu­sic-video app, from op­er­at­ing in the United States.</p>
    <p>Trea­sury Sec­re­tary Steve Mnuchin, in a sep­a­rate in­ter­view yes­ter­day, said that Tik­Tok must ei­ther be sold or blocked in the US due to na­tional se­cu­rity con­cerns. Tik­Tok, he said, sim­ply “can­not ex­ist as it does”.</p>
    <p>“I will say pub­licly that the en­tire com­mit­tee agrees that Tik­Tok can­not stay in the cur­rent for­mat be­cause it risks send­ing back in­for­ma­tion on 100 mil­lion Amer­i­cans,” Mr Mnuchin said yes­ter­day on ABC. He was re­fer­ring to the Com­mit­tee on For­eign In­vest­ment in the US, which is re­view­ing Tik­Tok. Mr Mnuchin chairs the com­mit­tee.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump had said on Fri­day night that “as far as Tik­Tok is con­cerned, we’re ban­ning them from the United States”.</p>
    <p>He told re­porters that it would hap­pen “soon, im­me­di­ately. I mean es­sen­tially im­me­di­ately”.</p>
    <p>He also said he had the author­ity to ban the app, owned by ByteDance, one of China’s big­gest tech com­pa­nies, a move he could make by ex­ec­u­tive or­der or un­der the In­ter­na­tional Emer­gency Eco­nomic Pow­ers Act.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, ne­go­ti­a­tions for Mi­crosoft to buy the US op­er­a­tions of Tik­Tok are on hold af­ter what Mr Trump said, the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) re­ported last Satur­day.</p>
    <p>US of­fi­cials have said that Tik­Tok could be a tool for Chi­nese in­tel­li­gence – a claim that ByteDance has re­peat­edly de­nied.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump’s words were re­port­edly al­ready adding to un­cer­tain­ties for Tik­Tok.</p>
    <p>“Be­fore Mr Trump’s re­marks, the two sides be­lieved the broad strokes of a deal could be in place by Mon­day,” WSJ had re­ported, cit­ing un­named sources.</p>
    <p>The re­port also said Mr Trump’s threats and op­po­si­tion to the deal had prompted Tik­Tok to make fur­ther con­ces­sions, in­clud­ing adding up to 10,000 jobs in the US over the next three years.</p>
    <p>Tik­Tok de­fended it­self last Satur­day, with its gen­eral man­ager for the US, Ms Vanessa Pap­pas, telling users that the com­pany was work­ing to give them “the safest app”, amid Amer­i­can con­cerns over data se­cu­rity.</p>
    <p>Tik­Tok, which is es­pe­cially pop­u­lar with young au­di­ences who cre­ate and watch its short-form videos, has an es­ti­mated one bil­lion users world­wide.</p>
    <p>It has grown even faster now that the coro­n­avirus pan­demic has pushed peo­ple phys­i­cally away from one an­other, but into close con­tact on­line.</p>
    <p>Ear­lier me­dia re­ports had sug­gested that Mr Trump would re­quire that the app’s US op­er­a­tions be di­vested from ByteDance, but he in­stead an­nounced a ban.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump’s an­nounce­ment of the ban drew crit­i­cism from some in the tech­nol­ogy sec­tor, in­clud­ing for­mer Face­book chief se­cu­rity of­fi­cer Alex Sta­mos, who ques­tioned whether the move was spurred by na­tional se­cu­rity con­cerns.</p>
    <p>“A 100 per cent sale to an Amer­i­can com­pany would have been con­sid­ered a rad­i­cal so­lu­tion two weeks ago and, even­tu­ally, mit­i­gates any rea­son­able data pro­tec­tion con­cerns,” Mr Sta­mos wrote on Twit­ter.</p>
    <p>Tik­Tok users had em­ployed the apps’ sig­na­ture short-form videos to poke fun at Mr Trump.</p>
    <p>One clip that was liked more than 300,000 times shows a young woman stack­ing bricks and smear­ing orange paint on her face, ap­par­ent in a dig at the US Pres­i­dent’s skin tone and con­tro­ver­sial pledge to build a wall be­tween the US and Mex­ico.</p>
    <p>A Tik­Tok spokesman in a state­ment said the busi­ness’s US$1 bil­lion (S$1.38 bil­lion) cre­ator fund also sup­ports peo­ple in the coun­try who are build­ing liveli­hoods from the plat­form.</p>
    <p>“Tik­Tok US user data is stored in the US, with strict con­trols on em­ployee ac­cess,” she said. “Tik­Tok’s big­gest in­vestors come from the US. We are com­mit­ted to pro­tect­ing our users’ pri­vacy and safety.”</p>
