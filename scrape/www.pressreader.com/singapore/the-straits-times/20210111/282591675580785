    <p>At the Fan house­hold, the three sis­ters look for­ward to rainy days as they get to put on their rain­coats and head to the play­ground.</p>
    <p>They love be­ing at home just as much, says Ms Yvonne Li, 37, of her daugh­ters Katie, seven; Kayla, five; and Klara, three.</p>
    <p>While the wet weather can make one feel sleepy, in­door ac­tiv­i­ties do not have to be a drag, says Ms Re­nee Sim, 31, se­nior cur­ricu­lum man­ager at EtonHouse In­ter­na­tional Ed­u­ca­tion Group and mother of a two-year-old boy.</p>
    <p>Ms Li, man­ag­ing di­rec­tor and co­founder of public re­la­tions agency Tate Anzur, agrees, say­ing rainy days are per­fect for qual­ity fam­ily time.</p>
    <p>Here are 10 sug­ges­tions for in­door rainy day ac­tiv­i­ties for kids.</p>
    <p>1</p>
    <p>RE­CY­CLE AND IMAG­INE</p>
    <p>Do not dis­card card­board boxes, big or small, from your pur­chases. Ms Li says her daugh­ters get to do any­thing they want with them, from cre­at­ing houses and boats to us­ing them as can­vases for art.</p>
    <p>2</p>
    <p>BUILD A FORT</p>
    <p>Gather pil­lows, blan­kets and cud­dly soft toys to make a fort, sug­gests Ms Sim. Snug­gle up with the kids and en­joy their favourite books or movies to­gether. When night falls, take out the flash­light for some shadow play.</p>
    <p>3</p>
    <p>DO SCI­ENCE EX­PER­I­MENTS</p>
    <p>Sim­ple in­gre­di­ents found in the kitchen can be used for ed­u­ca­tional ac­tiv­i­ties. Ms Li and her kids have tried mak­ing “magic milk” us­ing dish­wash­ing liq­uid, milk and food colour­ing, based on an ex­per­i­ment fea­tured in this news­pa­per. In an­other ac­tiv­ity, her chil­dren watched but­ter­fly pea tea change colour when acidic lemon juice was added.</p>
    <p>4 EX­PLORE TEX­TURES</p>
    <p>Play­ing with sen­sory tex­tures helps young chil­dren im­prove their fine mo­tor skills and is ex­cel­lent for hon­ing their imag­i­na­tion too, says Ms Sim.</p>
    <p>Fill a con­tainer with a base such as wa­ter, paint, slime, sand, play dough or foam. Then let your kids add their favourite ac­tion fig­ures, cars and char­ac­ter toys.</p>
    <p>5</p>
    <p>SET CHAL­LENGES</p>
    <p>Ms Li’s daugh­ters love Lego and can spend hours play­ing with the toy bricks. She would give them themed chal­lenges, such as to build their dream home or a gar­den, to be com­pleted within a time limit.</p>
    <p>Each child will then do a show-and-tell and the win­ner gets a prize.</p>
    <p>6</p>
    <p>BRING THE PLAY­GROUND</p>
    <p>IN­DOORS</p>
    <p>Have a game of hop­scotch at home by us­ing mask­ing tape, sug­gests Ms Li. The kids can keep ac­tive as well as have fun bal­anc­ing and hop­ping. They also learn how to take turns.</p>
    <p>At EtonHouse Pre-School cam­puses, Ms Sim says equip­ment such as plas­tic cones and bal­anc­ing beams are brought in­doors to cre­ate a safe ob­sta­cle course in the play gym.</p>
    <p>Some ex­er­cise games do not re­quire any equip­ment. The chil­dren are asked to use their imag­i­na­tion to pre­tend to jump like a frog, wad­dle like a duck or roll from one side of the room to an­other like a log.</p>
    <p>7</p>
    <p>PLAY SCAV­ENGER HUNT</p>
    <p>Take turns with your kids to hide items around the home. Do not for­get to make a list of these items.</p>
    <p>For older chil­dren, add an ed­u­ca­tional el­e­ment by in­clud­ing items that they may not be fa­mil­iar with. This will re­quire them to do ex­tra read­ing from the list you pro­vide them, says Ms Sim.</p>
    <p>En­sure that all items can be safely gath­ered by your kids and make the last item on the list the hard­est to find.</p>
    <p>8</p>
    <p>KEEP FIT TO­GETHER</p>
    <p>Look up ex­er­cise videos on YouTube and work up a sweat with fam­ily car­dio work­outs, sug­gests Ms Sim. Or prac­tise mind­ful­ness with yoga.</p>
    <p>9</p>
    <p>GIVE SCREEN TIME WITH LIM­ITS</p>
    <p>It gets tir­ing when you have to en­ter­tain chil­dren non-stop. When Ms Li needs a break, it is YouTube Kids, which has con­tent deemed ap­pro­pri­ate for young ones, to the res­cue.</p>
    <p>She al­lo­cates her kids a fixed amount of time us­ing the timer func­tion on the app.</p>
    <p>10</p>
    <p>BAKE AND EAT</p>
    <p>As­sign your chil­dren re­spon­si­bil­i­ties. For in­stance, they can help with mea­sur­ing, mix­ing and knead­ing. They will feel im­por­tant and use­ful, and have a sense of achieve­ment when they help bake some­thing yummy, says Ms Sim.</p>
    <p>Al­ways en­sure they are closely su­per­vised when they han­dle kitchen equip­ment.</p>
