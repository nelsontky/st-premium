    <p>Je­lena Ostapenko ad­mit­ted yes­ter­day she was de­lighted her break­through 2017 Roland Gar­ros tri­umph helped in­spire Naomi Osaka to three Grand Slam crowns.</p>
    <p>The Lat­vian stunned the sport three years ago with her run to the ti­tle in Paris, claim­ing a first ca­reer crown by see­ing off the likes of Saman­tha Sto­sur, Caro­line Woz­ni­acki, and Si­mona Halep in the fi­nal where she over­turned a 6-4, 3-0 deficit.</p>
    <p>Since then, Ja­pan’s Osaka, who turns 23 in just over two weeks, has be­come a global star by win­ning the 2018 and 2020 US Opens and 2019 Aus­tralian Open.</p>
    <p>Bianca An­dreescu won the 2019 US Open at just 19 while Sofia Kenin, 21, claimed the Mel­bourne ti­tle this year as the next gen­er­a­tion of women’s tennis threaten to push aside the old guard.</p>
    <p>“It was tough to deal with all this pres­sure which was on me be­cause</p>
    <p>ob­vi­ously, I was the first one from the year 1997 to win a Slam but I felt the girls started to play bet­ter af­ter that,” said Ostapenko, who stunned sec­ond seed Karolina Pliskova 6-4, 6-2 to reach the French Open third round yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>“Es­pe­cially Naomi, she’s such a good player. Maybe 2017 in­spired them, and they saw that it’s pos­si­ble. So the young gen­er­a­tion is com­ing. But also when I saw her win­ning, of course I also wanted to get back there on top and win another Slam. So we kind of have all in­spired each other which is good.”</p>
    <p>Ostapenko had only just turned 20 and was 47th in the world when she won in Paris three years ago al­though it has been a roller-coaster ride ever since.</p>
    <p>Her ti­tle de­fence ended in the first round in 2018 at the hands of Kateryna Ko­zlova while Vic­to­ria Azarenka dished out another open­ing-round loss last year.</p>
    <p>She made the Wim­ble­don semi-fi­nals in 2018 but has yet to get past the third round at ei­ther the Aus</p>
    <p>tralian or US Open.</p>
    <p>“It’s hard to com­pare to 2017 be­cause I was fear­less, no­body re­ally knew me,” added Ostapenko, now ranked 43rd. “But now they know how I play and how to play against me.”</p>
    <p>She fired 27 win­ners past Pliskova and she be­lieves the slower con­di­tions of a tour­na­ment be­ing played in the au­tumn, rather than its tra­di­tional May-June slot, play right into her com­fort zone.</p>
    <p>Her game now also in­cor­po­rates more drop shots rather than her once trade­mark all-or-noth­ing mis­siles fired down ei­ther flank.</p>
    <p>“Girls are ex­pect­ing me al­ways to hit the ball so strong, and es­pe­cially here on clay, so it’s use­ful be­cause the bounces are much lower be­cause it’s much colder,” she said.</p>
    <p>“The drop shot is very use­ful. Even if I can’t hit win­ners, some­times, I mix it up and the girls don’t ex­pect it.”</p>
    <p>For Pliskova, it’s the end of another fruit­less trip to the French cap­i­tal. The 28-year-old Czech made the semi-fi­nals in 2017 but has now failed to get be­yond the third round in her eight other ap­pear­ances.</p>
    <p>This year, she made the third round at the Aus­tralian Open and just the sec­ond round in New York.</p>
    <p>“I think maybe the year is fin­ished,” said Pliskova, who re­mains the only ac­tive for­mer world No. 1 who has not won a Grand Slam.</p>
    <p>“Def­i­nitely, I was not play­ing great. I think maybe the same level as the match be­fore, but of course, she’s a much bet­ter player. Not much to say about this match.”</p>
    <p>In the men’s draw, world No. 1 No­vak Djokovic clinched his 70th ca­reer win at the French Open with a 6-1, 6-2, 6-2 win over Ri­car­das Ber­ankis of Lithua­nia. The Serb, chas­ing an 18th Ma­jor, is also bid­ding to be­come the first man in half a cen­tury to win all four Slams twice.</p>
