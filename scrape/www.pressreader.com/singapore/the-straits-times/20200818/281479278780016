    <p>Fac­tory op­er­a­tor Nu­rul Hi­dayah Norezan was among hun­dreds of Malaysians who made their way across the Cause­way to Sin­ga­pore yes­ter­day, as the two coun­tries’ cross-bor­der travel ar­range­ments kicked in.</p>
    <p>As there is no pub­lic trans­port ply­ing the 1km-long Cause­way, Ms Nu­rul, 28, joined oth­ers in making their way on foot in the early hours of the morn­ing. The jour­ney took over an hour as they had lug­gage in tow.</p>
    <p>She used to com­mute daily be­tween Sin­ga­pore and Jo­hor for her job here, but had been away since March, when Kuala Lumpur closed Malaysia’s bor­ders amid the pan­demic, catch­ing many off guard.</p>
    <p>She told The Straits Times: “I’m ex­cited to be back to work again but at the same time I’m sad that I’ll be sep­a­rated from my one-year-old child.”</p>
    <p>Hun­dreds of Malaysians were also leav­ing Sin­ga­pore yes­ter­day to go back to their home towns.</p>
    <p>Ho­tel worker Muhd Shafii Muhd, 40, was ex­cited to see his fam­ily in Jo­hor Baru af­ter five months of sep­a­ra­tion. His em­ployer has al­lowed him to take the rest of the year off un­der a no-pay leave scheme and he will re­turn to his job here in Jan­uary.</p>
    <p>“The first thing I am go­ing to do is spend time with my fam­ily, that’s the most im­por­tant thing... money can wait,” he said.</p>
    <p>The re­sump­tion of cross-bor­der travel takes place un­der t wo schemes: the re­cip­ro­cal green lane (RGL) for trav­ellers on shorter vis­its, and the longer-term pe­ri­odic com­mut­ing ar­range­ment (PCA).</p>
    <p>The RGL fa­cil­i­tates short-term travel for es­sen­tial busi­ness or official pur­poses be­tween both sides for up to 14 days, while the PCA al­lows Sin­ga­pore and Malaysia res­i­dents who hold long-term im­mi­gra­tion passes for busi­ness and work in the other coun­try to en­ter it for work.</p>
    <p>In re­sponse to queries from The Straits Times, a spokesman for Sin­ga­pore’s Min­istry of Trade and In­dus­try said the sys­tems for re­ceiv­ing PCA and RGL ap­pli­ca­tions are work­ing well. “Govern­ment agen­cies will con­tinue to en­sure that the re­open­ing of our bor­ders is done in a care­ful and cal­i­brated man­ner, while bal­anc­ing eco­nomic in­ter­ests and safe­guard­ing pub­lic health.”</p>
    <p>In Malaysia, Jo­hor Im­mi­gra­tion di­rec­tor Ba­harud­din Tahir said yes­ter­day that ap­pli­ca­tions un­der RGL and PCA are fully booked un­til Fri­day.</p>
    <p>Malaysia’s For­eign Min­is­ter Hisham­mud­din Hus­sein said last month that 2,000 Malaysians and Sin­ga­pore­ans are al­lowed to cross daily un­der PCA, while un­der RGL, 400 a week can travel to and fro.</p>
    <p>As at 10am yes­ter­day, about 300 peo­ple had crossed the bor­der in both di­rec­tions, said Jo­hor Pub­lic Works, In­fra­struc­ture and Trans­porta­tion Com­mit­tee chair­man Mohd Soli­han Badri.</p>
    <p>He told The Straits Times that a free shut­tle ser­vice has been pro­vided for those with no trans­port to cross the Cause­way. The ser­vice started at 5pm yes­ter­day and will ferry pas­sen­gers be­tween the Jo­hor im­mi­gra­tion check­point and the Sin­ga­pore bor­der on the Cause­way.</p>
    <p>Be­fore the pan­demic, more than 300,000 trav­ellers used the Cause­way ev­ery day. Among these were about 100,000 Malaysians who com­muted daily to Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, some Malaysians said they are stay­ing put for now.</p>
    <p>Ms Cindy Ong, 33, a nurse, re­turned to Jo­hor Baru last De­cem­ber to give birth. Her husband, who works in cus­tomer ser­vice, went back three months later. “As of now, we get by with our sav­ings. My husband is also help­ing out a friend’s busi­ness. We are hop­ing bor­ders will re­open com­pletely to al­low for daily travel so that we can re­sume our work in Sin­ga­pore,” she said.</p>
    <p>Mar­ket­ing man­ager Steven Tan, 39, who is in Sin­ga­pore, felt it was a has­sle to ap­ply for the PCA scheme.</p>
    <p>“The quar­an­tine process both in Malaysia and Sin­ga­pore is a de­ter­rent for me. I can’t take so many days off just to go back and not do any­thing,” he said.</p>
