    <p>All it took was one el­bow strike to make Amir Khan feel like him­self again.</p>
    <p>Af­ter carv­ing out a rep­u­ta­tion as one of One Cham­pi­onship’s top knock­out artists – 10 of his first 11 wins all came through stop­pages – the Sin­ga­porean mixed mar­tial arts (MMA) fighter’s steady rise was halted af­ter an un­suc­cess­ful light­weight ti­tle fight in Nov 2018.</p>
    <p>That de­feat was fol­lowed by two more losses, by sub­mis­sion and knock­out. Amir stopped the skid with a slim de­ci­sion win in his next bout, but then slipped to an­other sub­mis­sion loss af­ter that.</p>
    <p>But as he pre­pares to face South Korean fighter Park Dae-sung at One’s Col­li­sion Course II event to be broad­cast to­mor­row night, the 26-year-old feels he has fi­nally re­dis­cov­ered his mojo.</p>
    <p>Part of that is down to an im­pres­sive first-round knock­out of In­dian fighter Rahul Raju with a deft el­bow at One’s Reign of Dy­nas­ties event on Oct 9.</p>
    <p>When asked how it felt to post a first knock­out since Septem­ber 2018, Amir said with a sat­is­fied smile: “It was a good feel­ing. I knew I had it in me, but it just did not ar­rive in my pre­vi­ous fights… Now, I want more.”</p>
    <p>His trainer, for­mer Ul­ti­mate Fight­ing Cham­pi­onship wel­ter­weight fighter Si­yar Ba­hadurzada, chipped in: “If it wasn’t that kind of fin­ish, it doesn’t feel right.”</p>
    <p>Ba­hadurzada is an­other rea­son why Amir feels con­fi­dent head­ing into his fight against Park.</p>
    <p>The Dutch­man, who in Jan­uary be­came the head trainer at Evolve MMA which Amir is a part of, has rein­vig­o­rated him as he works to­wards One’s light­weight ti­tle.</p>
    <p>Said Amir: “We’re find­ing my personalit­y as a fighter, and I feel like pieces of the puz­zle are com­ing to­gether.</p>
    <p>“There are ex­cit­ing times to come ahead for me for sure.”</p>
    <p>Ba­hadurzada, 36, said that his first i mpres­sion of the Sin­ga­porean was that he did not lack any tech­ni­cal abil­ity.</p>
    <p>“Amir knows how to strike, wres­tle, grap­ple at a high level,” he said.</p>
    <p>“What he lacked was lead­er­ship, some­body to (guide) and make the en­vi­ron­ment right for him.”</p>
    <p>The trainer added that af­ter analysing his past fights, he found that Amir did not utilise his full arse­nal of­ten enough, and so fo­cused on mak­ing him train “more ef­fi­ciently”.</p>
    <p>“It’s be­gin­ning to pay off. The Amir to­day is not the same Amir from six months ago,” said Ba­hadurzada.</p>
    <p>“We’ll see a much more ma­ture Amir (against Park). Fo­cused, ded­i­cated, sharper, stronger.”</p>
    <p>These at­tributes, he added, are what makes him con­fi­dent Amir has what it takes to cap­ture the light­weight ti­tle if he mounts a chal­lenge.</p>
    <p>“He’s been around the game for a long time, he’s tasted the best in the di­vi­sion and he knows how it feels,” said Ba­hadurzada, who was also the for­mer mid­dleweight cham­pion in re­spected Ja­panese or­gan­i­sa­tion Shooto.</p>
    <p>“Get­ting back to the top is not as dif­fi­cult as he did it the first time and this time, he’ll know what to do to suc­ceed.”</p>
    <p>We’re find­ing my personalit­y as a fighter, and I feel like pieces of the puz­zle are com­ing to­gether. There are ex­cit­ing times to come ahead for me for sure.</p>
