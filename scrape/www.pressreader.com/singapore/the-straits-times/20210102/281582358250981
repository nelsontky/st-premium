    <p>A Raf­fles Girls’ School (RGS) stu­dent was among the three com­mu­nity cases an­nounced yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The 14-year-old Sin­ga­porean is a friend of an ear­lier confirmed case – a fam­ily mem­ber of a per­ma­nent res­i­dent, a marine sur­veyor at Lloyd’s Reg­is­ter Sin­ga­pore who was also pre­vi­ously confirmed to have the coro­n­avirus.</p>
    <p>The teen had vis­ited her friend, who is also an RGS stu­dent, at her home on Dec 27 for a few hours while the marine sur­veyor was present. As a re­sult, the girl, who was last in school in Oc­to­ber, was iden­ti­fied as a close con­tact on Tues­day and placed on quar­an­tine, said the Min­istry of Health (MOH).</p>
    <p>She de­vel­oped a fever on Wed­nes­day and was taken by am­bu­lance to KK Women’s and Chil­dren’s Hospi­tal, where she was tested for the virus, added the min­istry. Her test re­sult came back pos­i­tive for the in­fec­tion on Thurs­day. Her sero­log­i­cal test re­sult has also come back neg­a­tive, in­di­cat­ing that it is likely a cur­rent in­fec­tion, said MOH.</p>
    <p>The se­cond com­mu­nity case is a 52-year-old Sin­ga­porean woman who works as a client an­a­lyst at Deutsche Bank at One Raf­fles Quay but does not in­ter­act with clients or ex­ter­nal par­ties.</p>
    <p>She is a fam­ily mem­ber of an ear­lier confirmed case, a Sin­ga­porean who works as a har­bour pi­lot, as well as two com­mu­nity cases re­ported on Thurs­day, said MOH.</p>
    <p>She de­vel­oped symp­toms on Mon­day and sought med­i­cal treat­ment at a gen­eral prac­ti­tioner clinic on Tues­day. How­ever, she chose not to take a Covid-19 test de­spite be­ing ad­vised by a doc­tor to do so. She was given five days’ med­i­cal leave dur­ing which she had to re­main at home.</p>
    <p>On Thurs­day, she was placed on quar­an­tine af­ter be­ing iden­ti­fied as a close con­tact of pre­vi­ous com­mu­nity cases and re­ported be­ing un­well when con­tacted by MOH.</p>
    <p>Her test re­sult came back pos­i­tive for Covid-19 af­ter she was taken to the Na­tional Cen­tre for In­fec­tious Dis­eases (NCID) in an am­bu­lance.</p>
    <p>Her sero­log­i­cal test re­sult came back neg­a­tive, in­di­cat­ing there is likely a cur­rent in­fec­tion.</p>
    <p>Those ad­vised by their doc­tors to take a Covid-19 test should do so, to al­low early iden­ti­fi­ca­tion of af­fected in­di­vid­u­als and to con­tain fur­ther spread of the virus, the MOH said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The only un­linked com­mu­nity case is a 53-yearold Ja­panese man who is em­ployed by Kuro­sawa and Part­ners, a man­age­ment con­sul­tancy firm, but who works from his home in Ro­chor Road.</p>
    <p>The work pass holder is asymp­to­matic, and his con­di­tion was de­tected when he took a Covid-19 pre-de­par­ture test on Thurs­day in prepa­ra­tion for his re­turn to Ja­pan.</p>
    <p>He had ar­rived in Sin­ga­pore from Ja­pan on Nov 26 and served his stay-home no­tice (SHN) at a ded­i­cated fa­cil­ity un­til Dec 10.</p>
    <p>A pre-de­par­ture test he took in Ja­pan on Nov 24 was neg­a­tive for Covid-19 and his test on Dec 6 dur­ing his SHN was neg­a­tive as well.</p>
    <p>He was taken to NCID yes­ter­day af­ter his re­sult came back pos­i­tive for Covid-19 in­fec­tion on Thurs­day night. His sero­log­i­cal test re­sult has come back pos­i­tive.</p>
    <p>In the state­ment yes­ter­day, MOH also said that fol­low­ing an in­ves­ti­ga­tion of Man­darin Or­chard Sin­ga­pore, it has “de­ter­mined that there was no fur­ther trans­mis­sion” be­yond the 13 cases pre­vi­ously re­ported. It has ap­proved the re­open­ing of the ho­tel from to­day, in­clud­ing its restau­rant and event spa­ces.</p>
    <p>There were also 27 new im­ported coro­n­avirus cases confirmed yes­ter­day, tak­ing Sin­ga­pore’s to­tal to 58,629.</p>
    <p>Restau­rants at Chi­jmes and Tan­jong Pa­gar as well as Takashimay­a Depart­ment Store at Ngee Ann City were among the new places vis­ited by Covid-19 pa­tients while they were still in­fec­tious, said MOH.</p>
    <p>Over­all, the num­ber of new cases in the com­mu­nity has in­creased from one case in the week be­fore to 10 cases in the past week.</p>
    <p>The num­ber of un­linked cases in the com­mu­nity has also in­creased from one case in the week be­fore to four cases in the past week.</p>
    <p>A to­tal of 56 pa­tients re­main in hospi­tal while 85 are re­cu­per­at­ing in com­mu­nity fa­cil­i­ties. One pa­tient is in crit­i­cal con­di­tion in the in­ten­sive care unit.</p>
