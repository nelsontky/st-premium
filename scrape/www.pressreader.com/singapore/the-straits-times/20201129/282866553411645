    <p>Fairoz Hasan started this year con­tem­plat­ing an early re­tire­ment from pro­fes­sional foot­ball. As De­cem­ber ap­proaches, he finds him­self closer than ever to a dif­fer­ent end­ing – win­ning his first ma­jor tro­phy.</p>
    <p>His team Al­birex Ni­igata lead the Sin­ga­pore Premier League (SPL) by two points from Tampines Rovers and face the Stags this evening, know­ing a win will ex­tend that lead to five and leave them on the brink of the cham­pi­onship. After the game at the Jurong East Sta­dium, both sides will have just two matches left.</p>
    <p>Fairoz, who turned 32 on Thurs­day, is one of eight Sin­ga­pore­ans in Al­birex’s 26-man squad and has made some telling con­tri­bu­tions to the Ja­panese club’s ti­tle chal­lenge. He has started seven of the eight games since the league’s restart and scored in the 3-2 de­ci­sive win over fel­low con­tenders Lion City Sailors on Nov 22.</p>
    <p>“To score against a big team and big spenders like the Sailors, it was like scor­ing against the SPL’s Real Madrid,” said Fairoz. “To be hon­est, it’s amaz­ing I’m even in this po­si­tion now and I can’t re­ally de­scribe how it feels.”</p>
    <p>The jour­ney­man mid­fielder – he started his ca­reer in 2008 with the Young Li­ons be­fore stints at Gey­lang United, Gom­bak United and</p>
    <p>Hougang United – was left in limbo be­fore the start of this sea­son after his for­mer club War­riors FC were or­dered to sit out the cam­paign ow­ing to their fi­nan­cial is­sues.</p>
    <p>“The thought of quit­ting did cross my mind, but ul­ti­mately, I did not feel ready to give up yet,” said the for­mer na­tional Un­der-23 player.</p>
    <p>He re­ceived help from the Foot­ball As­so­ci­a­tion of Sin­ga­pore, which of­fered him a part-time job and the op­por­tu­nity to train with the U-22 Young Li­ons as he waited and hoped an­other club would give him a chance. He also be­came a food de­liv­ery rider on his mo­tor­cy­cle dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker pe­riod.</p>
    <p>“I had to find a way to put food on the ta­ble for my wife and daugh­ter,” said Fairoz, whose daugh­ter Lana Arissa is two. “Through­out, it was not easy to jug­gle the work while try­ing to main­tain my fitness through run­ning and train­ing with the ball on my own, but I just had to be dis­ci­plined.”</p>
    <p>His per­se­ver­ance paid off when Al­birex con­tacted him after cir­cuit-breaker re­stric­tions were eased in mid-June and SPL teams started train­ing again. After a twoweek trial, the White Swans of­fered him a con­tract.</p>
    <p>“After the first day of train­ing, I went back home and took panadol be­cause my body was aching ev­ery­where and I had a headache,” he re­called with a wry smile.</p>
    <p>Be­sides Fairoz, an­other lo­cal in the Al­birex team who has had a pos­i­tive im­pact re­cently is Ong Yu En.</p>
    <p>The 17-year-old scored the opener in Al­birex’s 2-0 win over Young Li­ons on Wed­nes­day – it was the teenager’s first start in the league and his first goal.</p>
    <p>He said: “Go­ing from play­ing at school and youth level to the SPL was a big jump. But I have to give a lot of credit to all my team­mates here, be­cause they have been very sup­port­ive to­wards me.”</p>
    <p>Al­birex head coach Keiji Shige­tomi praised the Sin­ga­pore play­ers for giv­ing their best in every train­ing ses­sion and said their tac­ti­cal un­der­stand­ing has im­proved “sig­nif­i­cantly”. He added they have as­sim­i­lated into his team seam­lessly.</p>
    <p>“Did you see the cel­e­bra­tion of Ja­panese play­ers at Yu En’s goal? That is telling of this team’s sit­u­a­tion, that all the play­ers work as one unit,” said Shige­tomi.</p>
    <p>He was con­fi­dent his team can main­tain their good run – hav­ing won six of their last seven games – against Tampines and cap­ture their fourth league crown after the 2016-18 hat-trick.</p>
    <p>Fairoz was equally bullish and said: “The team is very united, ev­ery­one pushes one an­other, and we want to fin­ish this jour­ney to the ti­tle to­gether.”</p>
    <p>In this most un­pre­dictable year, a fairy tale is still pos­si­ble.</p>
