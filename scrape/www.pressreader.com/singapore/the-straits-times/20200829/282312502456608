    <p>Move­ment re­stric­tions and safe dis­tanc­ing mea­sures amid the coro­n­avirus pan­demic de­pressed Thom­son Med­i­cal Group’s rev­enue for the six months ended June 30, drag­ging the main­board­listed group into the red.</p>
    <p>It posted a net loss of $97.5 mil­lion for the sec­ond half of its fis­cal year, re­vers­ing from the net profit of $240,000 in the year-ago pe­riod, t he pri­vate provider of health­care ser­vices for women and chil­dren said in re­sults re­leased on Thurs­day.</p>
    <p>With re­stric­tions for Sin­ga­pore and Malaysia grad­u­ally eas­ing from June, the group said it has seen a grad­ual recovery of pa­tient vol­umes across most seg­ments, hav­ing re­sumed op­er­a­tions of health­care ser­vices that were closed or op­er­at­ing un­der re­stricted con­di­tions ear­lier.</p>
    <p>The com­pany has changed its fi­nan­cial year end from Dec 31 to June 30. The lat­est re­sults thus cover an 18-month pe­riod from Jan 1, 2019 to June 30, 2020.</p>
    <p>Loss per share stood at 0.369 cent for the six months ended June, ver­sus earn­ings per share of 0.001 cent in the cor­re­spond­ing pe­riod last year.</p>
    <p>Rev­enue de­clined 12.3 per cent on the year to about $98 mil­lion, from $111.7 mil­lion pre­vi­ously.</p>
    <p>Thom­son Med­i­cal said its top line was af­fected by the move­ment re­stric­tions and safe dis­tanc­ing mea­sures im­ple­mented by gov­ern­ments to curb Covid-19 trans­mis­sion.</p>
    <p>Rev­enue from hospi­tal ser­vices de­creased by 8.5 per cent while rev­enue from spe­cialised ser­vices fell 18.6 per cent for the six months.</p>
    <p>This came as sev­eral ser­vices and satel­lite clin­ics in its Sin­ga­pore busi­ness were op­er­at­ing un­der “sig­nif­i­cantly re­stricted” con­di­tions, and in Malaysia, the pa­tient loads at the hospi­tal and fer­til­ity op­er­a­tions de­clined.</p>
    <p>How­ever, demand for ob­stet­ric ser­vices in Sin­ga­pore con­tin­ued to re­main healthy, mit­i­gat­ing the im­pact, Thom­son Med­i­cal said.</p>
    <p>The group sank into a half-year op­er­at­ing loss of $82.6 mil­lion, com­pared with an op­er­at­ing profit of about $19 mil­lion in the pre­vi­ous year.</p>
    <p>Ex­clud­ing the ef­fect of a one­off non-cash im­pair­ment recorded on the 9.2ha free­hold land lo­cated in the Iskan­dar Devel­op­ment Re­gion in Jo­hor Baru, Malaysia, the group would have recorded an op­er­at­ing profit of $10.8 mil­lion.</p>
    <p>The $93.4 mil­lion im­pair­ment on the land was driven in part by the po­lit­i­cal un­cer­tainty in Malaysia and the weak prop­erty mar­ket in re­cent years, which was ex­ac­er­bated by the Covid-19 pan­demic, Thom­son Med­i­cal said.</p>
    <p>No div­i­dend was de­clared be­cause the com­pany was loss-mak­ing. In the year-ago pe­riod, a fi­nal div­i­dend of 0.025 cent per share was de­clared.</p>
    <p>For the 18 months ended June 30, net loss amounted to al­most $97 mil­lion, while rev­enue to­talled $327.8 mil­lion.</p>
    <p>Thom­son Med­i­cal shares dropped 0.2 cent or 3.6 per cent to close at 5.4 cents on Thurs­day, be­fore the re­sults were re­leased.</p>
