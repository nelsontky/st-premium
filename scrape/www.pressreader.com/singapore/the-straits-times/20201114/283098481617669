    <p>AN UN­FOR­GET­TABLE BIRTH­DAY:</p>
    <p>Hong Kong ac­tor Shawn Yue, who lives in Tai­wan with his wife, model-ac­tress Sarah Wang, and their two-year-old son Cody, turned 39 yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>How­ever, Yue is un­der a 14-day quar­an­tine in Taipei af­ter re­turn­ing from film­ing in China. He has cho­sen to serve his quar­an­tine at his newly ren­o­vated of­fice.</p>
    <p>At the stroke of mid­night yes­ter­day, his wife and her three friends turned up out­side the glass wall of the of­fice to cel­e­brate his birth­day.</p>
    <p>Wang, who is preg­nant with the cou­ple’s sec­ond child, posted on In­sta­gram a photo of her car­ry­ing a cake while her hus­band looked on and smiled from the other side of the glass wall.</p>
    <p>The 32-year-old wrote: “Giving you lots of love and bless­ings even though we are sep­a­rated by glass... I hope this lit­tle sur­prise can make you happy.”</p>
    <p>Mean­while, Yue, who left four red-heart emo­jis in the com­ments sec­tion, posted a we­fie of him with his wife and her friends on the other side of the glass.</p>
    <p>He wrote on In­sta­gram:</p>
    <p>“Thanks, guys. This is the first time I am cel­e­brat­ing my birth­day this way and it feels strange.”</p>
    <p>The ac­tor is also hop­ing to give his son a hug. On Thurs­day, he posted a cou­ple of pho­tos in­clud­ing one of him play­ing toy cars with Cody through the glass wall and wrote: “Miss you so much.”</p>
    <p>Yue got his big break play­ing the younger ver­sion of Tony Le­ung Chiu Wai’s char­ac­ter – an un­der­cover cop – in the</p>
    <p>In­fer­nal Af­fairs tril­ogy (2002 and 2003).</p>
    <p>He was lauded for his role as a man strug­gling with bipo­lar dis­or­der in the ac­claimed movie Mad World (2016).</p>
    <p>He also starred in the ro­mance film Love In A Puff (2010) and its se­quels Love In The Buff (2012) and Love Off The Cuff (2017) with singer-ac­tress Miriam Ye­ung.</p>
