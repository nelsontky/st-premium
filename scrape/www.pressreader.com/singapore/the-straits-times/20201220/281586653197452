    <p>It is my hope that all Amer­i­cans will pro­tect them­selves by get­ting vac­ci­nated when the vac­cine be­comes avail­able to them. That is how our coun­try will be­gin to heal and move for­ward.</p>
    <p>TOP U.S. IN­FEC­TIOUS DISEASE SCI­EN­TIST AN­THONY FAUCI, on some peo­ple’s hes­i­tancy to em­brace the med­i­cal break­throughs.</p>
    <p>•</p>
    <p>NEW YORK Moderna’s coro­n­avirus vac­cine on Fri­day be­came the sec­ond to re­ceive emer­gen­cyuse au­tho­ri­sa­tion from the US Food and Drug Ad­min­is­tra­tion (FDA), wel­come news to a na­tion with a stag­ger­ing Covid-19 death toll of more than 307,000 vic­tims.</p>
    <p>Millions of doses of the Moderna vac­cine are ex­pected to be added to the US roll-out, which be­gan last week with health­care work­ers.</p>
    <p>Older peo­ple in long-term care fa­cil­i­ties are next in line for the vac­cines, with a US Cen­tres for Disease Con­trol and Preven­tion ex­pert panel to­day set to rec­om­mend what groups fol­low, as in­dus­tries com­pete to have their work­ers given prece­dence.</p>
    <p>The FDA an­nounced the au­tho­ri­sa­tion af­ter its panel of out­side ex­perts en­dorsed the use of Moderna’s vac­cine on Thurs­day.</p>
    <p>The agency had ap­proved a treat­ment from Pfizer and Ger­man part­ner BioNTech a week ear­lier.</p>
    <p>Based on sim­i­lar tech­nol­ogy, that vac­cine was given to thou­sands of US health­care work­ers last week in a mas­sive na­tion­wide roll-out.</p>
    <p>“With the avail­abil­ity of two vac­cines now for the preven­tion of Covid-19, the FDA has taken an­other cru­cial step in the fight against this global pan­demic that is caus­ing vast num­bers of hos­pi­tal­i­sa­tions and deaths in the United States each day,” FDA com­mis­sioner Stephen Hahn said.</p>
    <p>Moderna’s shot is ex­pected to be used in harder-to-reach lo­ca­tions, such as ru­ral hos­pi­tals.</p>
    <p>The vac­cine needs to be stored and shipped frozen but it does not re­quire the ul­tra-cold tem­per­a­tures of the Pfizer-BioNTech treat­ment.</p>
    <p>The speed of vac­cine de­vel­op­ment – less than a year from when the first case of the new coro­n­avirus was found in the US – is a stun­ning sci­en­tific suc­cess, al­though there is some hes­i­tancy among the public.</p>
    <p>“It is my hope that all Amer­i­cans will pro­tect them­selves by get­ting vac­ci­nated when the vac­cine be­comes avail­able to them,” top US in­fec­tious disease sci­en­tist An­thony Fauci said in a state­ment.</p>
    <p>“That is how our coun­try will be­gin to heal and move for­ward.”</p>
    <p>Moderna said it in­tends to ap­ply for a full Amer­i­can li­cence next year.</p>
    <p>The FDA de­ci­sion marks the first reg­u­la­tory au­tho­ri­sa­tion in the world for Moderna’s vac­cine and val­i­da­tion of its mes­sen­ger RNA tech­nol­ogy, shown to be nearly 95 per cent ef­fec­tive and with no se­ri­ous safety con­cerns.</p>
    <p>The vac­cine, de­vel­oped in part­ner­ship with the Na­tional In­sti­tutes of Health, had rel­a­tively mi­nor side ef­fects, in­clud­ing pain around the in­jec­tion site and swelling.</p>
    <p>The biotech com­pany has teamed up with the US gov­ern­ment to pre­pare for the dis­tri­bu­tion of 5.9 mil­lion shots as early as this week­end.</p>
    <p>Be­tween the two vac­cines, the US is ex­pect­ing 40 mil­lion doses be­fore the end of the year, enough to even­tu­ally vac­ci­nate 20 mil­lion peo­ple, as both vac­cines re­quire two shots.</p>
    <p>“Brighter days lie ahead,” re­sponded US Pres­i­dent-elect Joe Bi­den, who plans to be vac­ci­nated to­mor­row.</p>
