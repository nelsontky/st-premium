    <p>LON­DON • Leeds’ first English Premier League game in 16 years will see them play champions Liver­pool at An­field on Sept 12.</p>
    <p>Run­ners-up Manch­ester City and Manch­ester United will miss the open­ing week­end to give them ex­tra time to re­cover from their Euro­pean ex­er­tions.</p>
    <p>How­ever, that priv­i­lege was not ex­tended to Chelsea and Wolves, who will start their sea­sons on Sept 14 de­spite their in­volve­ment in Europe. The Blues ex­ited the Champions League nearly two weeks ago, while Wolves bid farewell to the Europa League last week.</p>
    <p>City and United were elim­i­nated from the Champions League and Europa League re­spec­tively last week­end, three weeks after the end of the top-flight sea­son.</p>
    <p>This means all 20 sides will have at least 30 days off – as guar­an­teed by the English Foot­ball As­so­ci­a­tion – be­tween sea­sons after the late fin­ish caused by the three-month coro­n­avirus stop­page.</p>
    <p>Leeds, back in the top tier for the first time since the 2003-04 sea­son, could not have asked for a tougher first game than the Reds, who have not lost a home league game in more than three years.</p>
    <p>Tot­ten­ham host Ever­ton, Ar­se­nal visit newly-pro­moted Ful­ham and Chelsea travel south to Brighton.</p>
    <p>United will kick off their sea­son at home to Crys­tal Palace on Sept 19, while City will travel to Wolves for their opener on the same day.</p>
    <p>Jur­gen Klopp’s men have a tricky start – trav­el­ling to Chelsea after Leeds be­fore wel­com­ing Ar­se­nal – but so do the Red Devils, who have to host Spurs, Chelsea and Ar­se­nal in their first seven games.</p>
    <p>United man­ager Ole Gun­nar Sol­sk­jaer will be even more con­cerned by their run-in as from March, his team face trips to City, Spurs and bit­ter ri­vals Leeds, be­fore host­ing Liver­pool at Old Traf­ford on May 1.</p>
    <p>The first ma­jor derby of the sea­son is set for Oct 17 when Ever­ton host Liver­pool in Mersey­side, while the two Manch­ester der­bies are sched­uled for the week­ends of Dec 12 and March 6.</p>
    <p>The sea­son, which will not have a win­ter break, will con­clude on May 23, less than three weeks be­fore the start of the resched­uled Euro 2020.</p>
    <p>Adrian, Liver­pool’s re­serve goal­keeper, yes­ter­day told the club web­site his team­mates were all “check­ing their phones” for the fix­tures.</p>
    <p>“Ev­ery­thing is com­ing closer and closer and closer,” he said. “We now know all the fix­tures from the be­gin­ning un­til the end, all the tough pe­ri­ods and the Christ­mas pe­riod.</p>
    <p>“It will be a nice sea­son, but tough. Last sea­son was won­der­ful and his­tor­i­cal, but now, we’re go­ing to be in the present and we face a big chal­lenge in front of us. We are more than ready to face the big chal­lenge of the sea­son that is com­ing.”</p>
    <p>His side will take on FA Cup win­ners Ar­se­nal in the tra­di­tional Com­mu­nity Shield cur­tain-raiser on Aug 29 at Wem­b­ley.</p>
