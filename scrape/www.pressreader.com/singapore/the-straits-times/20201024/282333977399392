    <p>NEW YORK • PayPal Hold­ings is ex­plor­ing ac­qui­si­tions of cryp­tocur­rency com­pa­nies, in­clud­ing bit­coin cus­to­dian BitGo, ac­cord­ing to peo­ple fa­mil­iar with the mat­ter, a move that would ex­pand its em­brace of digital coins.</p>
    <p>PayPal has been hold­ing talks with BitGo, a com­pany that helps in­vestors store bit­coin se­curely, and could reach a deal within weeks, the peo­ple said, ask­ing not to be iden­ti­fied be­cause the mat­ter is pri­vate.</p>
    <p>Talks could still fall apart and PayPal could opt to buy other tar­gets, the peo­ple added.</p>
    <p>It could not be learnt how much PayPal would pay for BitGo if it goes ahead with the deal. BitGo raised US$58.5 mil­lion (S$79.5 mil­lion) in 2018 at a US$170 mil­lion val­u­a­tion, ac­cord­ing to PitchBook.</p>
    <p>Rep­re­sen­ta­tives for BitGo and PayPal de­clined to com­ment.</p>
    <p>The Palo Alto, Cal­i­for­nia-based BitGo, founded in 2013 by chief ex­ec­u­tive of­fi­cer Mike Belshe, of­fers digital wal­lets that re­quire mul­ti­ple sig­na­tures for trans­ac­tions, as well as off­line vaults for stor­ing bit­coin and ri­val cur­ren­cies.</p>
    <p>It was one of the first com­pa­nies in the space to fo­cus on in­sti­tu­tional in­vestors, ac­cord­ing to its web­site.</p>
    <p>The com­pany ap­plied in Au­gust to New York reg­u­la­tors to be­come an in­de­pen­dent, reg­u­lated qual­i­fied cus­to­dian un­der New York State Bank­ing Law, a press re­lease showed. Cus­to­di­ans like BitGo are re­spon­si­ble for safe­keep­ing digital as­sets us­ing se­cure stor­age.</p>
    <p>PayPal an­nounced on Wed­nes­day that its cus­tomers can buy, sell and hold cryp­tocur­ren­cies – in­clud­ing bit­coin, ether, bit­coin cash and lite­coin – from digital wal­lets, as well as use the vir­tual money to shop at the 26 mil­lion mer­chants on its network.</p>
    <p>The an­nounce­ment led bit­coin to surge past US$13,000 for the first time since July last year.</p>
    <p>PayPal said it would part­ner with BitGo com­peti­tor Paxos Trust Com­pany, a reg­u­lated provider of cryp­tocur­rency prod­ucts and ser­vices, for its new ser­vice.</p>
    <p>BitGo is backed by in­vestors in­clud­ing Gold­man Sachs Group, Craft Ven­tures, Digital Cur­rency Group, DRW, Galaxy Digital Ven­tures, Red­point Ven­tures, Valor Eq­uity Part­ners and Founders Fund.</p>
