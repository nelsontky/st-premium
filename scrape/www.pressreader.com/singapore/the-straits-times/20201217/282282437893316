    <p>Since the end of Oc­to­ber, al­most 30 sound­proof work booths have been placed across nine malls in Sin­ga­pore as Covid-19 fu­els new de­mand for flex­i­ble workspaces.</p>
    <p>Cus­tomers can pay $3.60 an hour to work in these booths through an app called Switch, which was de­vel­oped by Sin­ga­pore-based co-work­ing firm JustCo.</p>
    <p>The chang­ing na­ture of work and work­places has cre­ated a new mar­ket where Sin­ga­pore busi­ness can in­no­vate, said Min­is­ter for Trade and In­dus­try Chan Chun Sing yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>He was speak­ing at JustCo’s out­let at The Cen­tre­point, where the com­pany launched its Dig­i­tal Fu­ture of Work Plat­form to show­case its new dig­i­tal tech­nolo­gies.</p>
    <p>Mr Chan elab­o­rated on what he saw as the “three dis­rup­tions” brought on by Covid-19 to the tra­di­tional idea of work.</p>
    <p>First, he ex­pressed his be­lief that the na­ture of work has changed, par­tic­u­larly with re­gard to the need for fixed of­fice space.</p>
    <p>Also, the ad­vent of re­mote work­ing and the fast tech­no­log­i­cal cy­cle means many com­pa­nies are “in­creas­ingly less will­ing to com­mit to long leases for of­fice space”.</p>
    <p>“Many of the com­pa­nies may also want... to scale up very quickly, (for) which the tra­di­tional busi­ness model of tak­ing long leases for huge of­fice spa­ces may not be the most ap­pro­pri­ate,” said Mr Chan.</p>
    <p>The third dis­rup­tion cen­tres on tra­di­tional re­tail.</p>
    <p>Mr Chan said e-com­merce has changed the re­la­tion­ship be­tween ten­ants and land­lords, and that con­ven­tional malls such as The Cen­tre­point will have to re-eval­u­ate how to op­ti­mise space and max­imise value for share­hold­ers.</p>
    <p>Thus, there is a need for con­tin­ued in­no­va­tion so that Sin­ga­pore can dis­tin­guish it­self in the new nor­mal, said Mr Chan.</p>
    <p>At the event, JustCo also an­nounced a spa­tial an­a­lyt­ics tool, SixSense. It uses ar­ti­fi­cial in­tel­li­gence (AI) to pro­vide real-time as­sess­ment of JustCo’s co-work­ing premises, to en­sure crowd con­trol and ad­her­ence to safe dis­tanc­ing.</p>
    <p>SixSense, which comes un­der JustCo’s suite of new smart workspace tech­nolo­gies, will also help the firm de­sign bet­ter work­places.</p>
    <p>Mr Kong Wan Sing, founder and chief ex­ec­u­tive of JustCo, said mil­lions have been in­vested in these in­no­va­tions, which were de­signed by REin­vent, a proptech in­no­va­tion stu­dio owned by JustCo.</p>
    <p>Al­though Switch and SixSense were con­cep­tu­alised last year, the on­set of Covid-19 ac­cel­er­ated the pace of work on these projects.</p>
    <p>“Peo­ple are look­ing to work on an on-de­mand... and flex­i­ble ba­sis,” said Mr Kong. “This is where JustCo comes into the pic­ture... to pro­vide all these flex­i­ble so­lu­tions.”</p>
    <p>JustCo is just one of many com­pa­nies that are look­ing to rein­vent their workspaces post-pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Ear­lier this month, Ger­many­based com­pany In­fi­neon an­nounced that it will spend $27 mil­lion over the next three years to em­bed AI into ev­ery job func­tion within its Sin­ga­pore hub.</p>
    <p>Dig­i­tal bank­ing is also on the rise, with li­cences be­ing awarded to tech gi­ant Sea and the GrabSing­tel con­sor­tium.</p>
    <p>“Of course, the jury is still out on how Covid-19 has trans­formed peo­ple’s work pat­terns,” said Mr Chan.</p>
    <p>Still, he called for more com­pa­nies to see this fast-chang­ing time as a chance to pur­sue in­no­va­tive ideas and seize new op­por­tu­ni­ties.</p>
