    <p>• Reece Hodge missed a last-gasp penalty as a 14-man Aus­tralia drew with Ar­gentina for the se­cond straight game to con­firm New Zealand as Tri Na­tions rugby cham­pi­ons yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The Wal­la­bies needed a crush­ing 101-point win over the Pu­mas, who were miss­ing cap­tain Pablo Mat­era af­ter a racist tweet scan­dal, to over­haul the All Blacks.</p>
    <p>Ar­gentina needed to win by 93 points, but a high-scor­ing match was never in prospect on a muggy night of steady rain in Syd­ney.</p>
    <p>In­stead, they fin­ished at 16-16, a fort­night af­ter they could not be sep­a­rated in a 15-15 clash.</p>
    <p>Hodge could have won the game but sent his 45-me­tre kick wide with a minute re­main­ing, just as he did in the dy­ing sec­onds of their drawn match two weeks ago.</p>
    <p>“They’re a tough cookie to crack, the Ar­gies,” said Aus­tralia cap­tain Michael Hooper.</p>
    <p>“We’re not happy with the per­for­mance, we’re dis­ap­pointed we can’t get a win in our last game.”</p>
    <p>Ar­gentina went to the break 13-6 in front, scor­ing 10 points when Hooper was in the sin-bin for a high tackle.</p>
    <p>Lukhan Salakaia-Loto was then sent off with 20 min­utes left.</p>

    <p>Se­cond time full-back Reece Hodge missed a se­cond last-gasp penalty in Aus­tralia’s two draws with Ar­gentina.</p>
    <p>“We showed a lot of char­ac­ter tonight, seven points down and re­duced to 14 men. We con­trolled it pretty well and got re­warded,” said Wal­la­bies coach Dave Ren­nie.</p>
    <p>The en­ter­tain­ing clash rounded out a south­ern hemi­sphere tour­na­ment re­duced to three teams af­ter World Cup hold­ers South Africa pulled out over coro­n­avirus is­sues.</p>
    <p>The draw en­sured Ar­gentina fin­ished se­cond, cap­ping a mo­men­tous tour by Mario Ledesma’s men, who en­dured lock­downs and a slew of Covid-19 cases be­fore up­set­ting New Zealand then draw­ing with Aus­tralia a fort­night ago.</p>
    <p>Their build-up to yes­ter­day’s game was also dis­rupted by the tweet­ing furore.</p>
    <p>Mat­era, se­cond row Guido Petti and re­place­ment hooker San­ti­ago So­cino were all sus­pended af­ter their years-old “dis­crim­i­na­tory and xeno­pho­bic” com­ments sur­faced, be­fore a shock U-turn saw them re­in­stated on Fri­day.</p>
    <p>The posts emerged af­ter crit­i­cism that the Pu­mas did not ad­e­quately pay trib­ute to Ar­gentina foot­ball icon Diego Maradona, who died last month, be­fore last week­end’s de­feat by the All Blacks.</p>
    <p>They all wore a No. 10 on the sleeve of their jer­seys yes­ter­day, in hon­our of Maradona, and were clearly fired-up.</p>
    <p>“I think we de­served this one, I thought we could have won it,” said Ledesma. “I’m re­ally happy with the whole tour and couldn’t be prouder of the guys.”</p>

        <p data-role="text">For the third time in six Tests, Reece Hodge fluffed a match-win&#xAD;ning at&#xAD;tempt. This meant Ar&#xAD;gentina held on for a 16-16 draw in Syd&#xAD;ney yes&#xAD;ter&#xAD;day and se&#xAD;cured se&#xAD;cond place in the Tri Na&#xAD;tions.</p>
