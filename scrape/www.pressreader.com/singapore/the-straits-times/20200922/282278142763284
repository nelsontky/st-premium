    <p>PARIS • Tadej Pogacar pulled off one the biggest coups in Tour de France his­tory and his bold­ness and ta­lent have been widely ac­claimed, yet it is too soon to tell if his ti­tle on Sun­day will be the start of long-term dom­i­na­tion.</p>
    <p>The Slovenian, who cel­e­brated his 22nd birth­day yes­ter­day, is the youngest Tour win­ner since Henri Cor­net in 1904 and the first debu­tant to win the race since Lau­rent Fignon in 1983.</p>
    <p>De­spite early set­backs, Pogacar man­aged to turn the ta­bles and tear apart his main ri­val Pri­moz Roglic’s pre-writ­ten script. Re­cent Tour his­tory, how­ever, shows that pure ta­lent is not al­ways enough.</p>
    <p>Pogacar lost key team­mates Fabio Aru and Da­vide For­molo early in the Tour while his com­pa­triot Roglic, who he leapfrogge­d in a mem­o­rable time trial on Satur­day, could rely on the sup­port of Jum­boVisma, ar­guably the most for­mi­da­ble out­fit in the race. But the Team UAE Emi­rates rider took his chances when he could, gain­ing 40 sec­onds on the Col de Peyre­sourde in the Pyre­nees with an at­tack Roglic did not cover. The day be­fore, Pogacar had lost 1 minute 21 sec­onds in cross­winds on a flat stage but he was not dis­cour­aged.</p>
    <p>“If I have the legs, I at­tack,” he said re­peat­edly, while Roglic rode con­ser­va­tively, seem­ingly con­tent with his ad­van­tage which had reached 57 sec­onds be­fore the time trial.</p>
    <p>Team Sky, who be­came Ineos and Ineos-Gre­nadiers, used their col­lec­tive force to choke the op­po­si­tion – set­ting a breath­tak­ing pace to pre­vent at­tacks – and Jumbo-Visma ap­plied the same tac­tics this year.</p>
    <p>Aus­tralian Richie Porte, who fin­ished third over­all, said that plan might have served Pogacar well.</p>
    <p>“In some re­spects, he was lucky that Jumbo-Visma set such a cracking pace on the climbs,” said the Trek-Se­ga­gredo rider.</p>
    <p>“If you’re able to hold the wheel then you’ve got a bit of a free ride.”</p>
    <p>Roglic, whose melt­down on Satur­day left him in tears, might never recover from the dis­ap­point­ment of los­ing the Tour on the last day, but the 30-year-old will be look­ing for re­venge.</p>
    <p>“It’s not go­ing to be like that next year. I think Pogacar is go­ing to be a marked man,” added Porte.</p>
    <p>The 23-year-old Egan Ber­nal was also widely tipped as a fu­ture Tour de France great but the Colom­bian ap­peared way off the pace be­fore pulling out with back pains and he could now fall be­hind Giro d’Italia win­ner Richard Cara­paz in the peck­ing or­der at Ineos-Gre­nadiers.</p>
    <p>When Jan Ull­rich won the 1997 ti­tle, he was also ac­claimed as a po­ten­tial great Tour de France rider, but the Ger­man never added to his only tri­umph.</p>
    <p>Be­hind Pogacar, Bel­gian prodigy Remco Evenepoel, 20, is also waiting for his Tour de France de­but, pos­si­bly in a cou­ple of years.</p>
    <p>For now though, Pogacar rel­ished the mo­ment on Sun­day as he mounted the podium while the sun set be­hind Paris’ Arc de Tri­om­phe to pick up the best climber’s jer­sey, the white top young rider’s prize and fi­nally the Tour win­ner’s fa­mous yel­low jer­sey.</p>
    <p>“I can’t find the words to thank every­one, the fans cheered me all the way,” he said af­ter the cer­e­mo­nial fi­nal stage into the French cap­i­tal.</p>
    <p>Paris Mayor Anne Hi­dalgo stood along­side Slovenian Pres­i­dent Borut Pa­hor while Pogacar un­furled his na­tional flag and draped it over his shoul­ders.</p>
    <p>“This is an in­cred­i­ble feel­ing, stand­ing here in Paris on the top of the podium,” Pogacar added.</p>
    <p>“It was an amaz­ing three weeks, an in­cred­i­ble jour­ney.”</p>
