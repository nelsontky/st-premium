    <p>•</p>
    <p>The world’s sec­ond­largest chip­maker, South Korea’s SK Hynix, yes­ter­day an­nounced a US$9 bil­lion (S$12.2 bil­lion) deal to buy In­tel’s flash mem­ory chip op­er­a­tion as it seeks to bol­ster its po­si­tion against ri­val be­he­moth Sam­sung Elec­tron­ics.</p>
    <p>SK Hynix is al­ready the world’s No. 2 maker of Dram chips, used in com­put­ers and servers, and the sec­ond-largest chip­maker over­all.</p>
    <p>But it has lagged in the mar­ket for flash mem­ory – or Nand – chips, which are used in ev­ery­day de­vices such as smart­phones and USB stor­age drives, as well as in­dus­trial and med­i­cal equip­ment.</p>
    <p>In a reg­u­la­tory fil­ing, SK Hynix said it will ac­quire In­tel’s “en­tire Nand busi­ness di­vi­sion ex­clud­ing the Op­tane di­vi­sion” for 10.3 tril­lion won (S$12.2 bil­lion), with In­tel’s fac­tory in Dalian, China, in­cluded in the deal.</p>
    <p>SK Hynix ranked fourth by global Nand sales in the sec­ond quar­ter this year, says mar­ket re­searcher Trend­force. In­tel was sixth.</p>
    <p>Their com­bi­na­tion will see SK Hynix leapfrog Ja­pan’s Kioxia and West­ern Dig­i­tal of the United States into sec­ond place with a mar­ket share of more than 23 per cent, the Trend­force num­bers show.</p>
    <p>The Nand and Dram mar­kets are both dom­i­nated by Sam­sung Elec­tron­ics, and global chip de­mand has boosted prof­its for the two South Korean firms in re­cent years.</p>
    <p>The pair com­pete to sup­ply chips to Amer­i­can gi­ants such as Ap­ple, Dell and HP, as well as Chi­nese com­pa­nies.</p>
    <p>The In­tel ac­qui­si­tion would strengthen the Nand op­er­a­tions of SK Hynix, which have “not been as</p>

    <p>strong as its other busi­nesses”, said Mr Ahn Ki-hyun, vice-pres­i­dent of the Korea Semi­con­duc­tor In­dus­try As­so­ci­a­tion.</p>
    <p>“With the deal, the com­pany has firmly ce­mented its sec­ond-largest po­si­tion in the global semi­con­duc­tor in­dus­try,” he added.</p>
    <p>“In the long run, the deal paves a way for it to be­come more com­pet­i­tive against Sam­sung.”</p>
    <p>The found­ing com­pany of SK Hynix was orig­i­nally part of the Hyundai group, one of the fam­i­ly­con­trolled con­glom­er­ates known as chae­bol that dom­i­nate busi­ness in the world’s 12th-largest econ­omy.</p>
    <p>In 2012, a multi­bil­lion-dol­lar merger saw it be­come part of the SK Group, the third-largest of the chae­bols, headed by Mr Chey Tae­won, who is mar­ried to the daugh­ter of the late South Korean pres­i­dent Roh Tae-woo.</p>
    <p>SK Hynix has grown to be­come a ma­jor com­pany in its own right and is the sec­ond-most valu­able com­pany listed on Seoul’s Kospi stock mar­ket with a mar­ket cap­i­tal­i­sa­tion of 62 tril­lion won, be­hind only Sam­sung Elec­tron­ics.</p>
    <p>But SK Hynix shares were down more than 2 per cent on the an­nounce­ment in morn­ing trade.</p>
    <p>Its chief ex­ec­u­tive Lee Seok-Hee said in a state­ment that the In­tel ac­qui­si­tion will en­able the firm to “proac­tively re­spond to var­i­ous needs from cus­tomers and op­ti­mise our busi­ness struc­ture”, and make its Nand flash mar­ket po­si­tion “com­pa­ra­ble with what we achieved in Dram”.</p>
    <p>The state­ment cited In­tel chief ex­ec­u­tive Bob Swan as say­ing the deal al­lows the US firm to fo­cus on “dif­fer­en­ti­ated tech­nol­ogy where we can play a big­ger role in the suc­cess of our cus­tomers”.</p>
    <p>The ac­qui­si­tion will be paid for in cash, funded through ex­ist­ing re­serves and bor­row­ing, SK Hynix said.</p>
