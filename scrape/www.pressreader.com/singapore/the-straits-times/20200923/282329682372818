    <p>STILL THE MAIN MAN</p>
    <p>•</p>
    <p>Rafael Nadal re­mains the “No. 1 favourite” for Roland Gar­ros, ri­val No­vak Djokovic said on Mon­day, but the Spa­niard’s last-eight exit at the Ital­ian Open showed he can be beaten on clay.</p>
    <p>Nadal, a 12-time French Open win­ner, l ost to world No. 15 Diego Schwartz­man last week.</p>
    <p>“Even though he lost (in Rome), I still think, a lot of peo­ple will agree, he’s the No. 1 favourite and, the record that he has there, the his­tory of his re­sults, you just can’t put any­body in front of him,” said Djokovic.</p>
    <p>The world No. 1 beat Ar­gen­tinian Schwartz­man 7-5, 6-3 in Mon­day’s fi­nal to win a fifth Rome ti­tle, and a record 36th Masters crown to move one bet­ter than Nadal.</p>
    <p>“But, you know, def­i­nitely Diego showed that Nadal is beat­able on clay,” added the Serb.</p>
    <p>Con­di­tions at the French Open, which be­gins on Sun­day, could also have an im­pact, with the tour­na­ment pushed back to au­tumn be­cause of the coro­n­avirus pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Nadal “prefers high bounces, that it is hot, that the ball goes fast”, said</p>
    <p>Djokovic, the French Open cham­pion in 2016.</p>
    <p>“So let’s see. It’s go­ing to be in­ter­est­ing. I think even though he’s the No. 1 favourite, there are play­ers that can win against him there.”</p>
    <p>Agree­ing, Schwartz­man said: “Rafa is the king. It’s his house. He went to Roland Gar­ros many years play­ing good, some­times not play­ing his best, and he won.”</p>
    <p>De­spite a great start, with two breaks to lead 3-0, Schwartz­man could not keep the mo­men­tum go­ing against 17-time Grand Slam win­ner Djokovic, who notched his fifth win over his ri­val in the Rome fi­nal.</p>
    <p>For the Serb, it was a fifth vic­tory in 10 fi­nals in Rome, but the first since 2015, hav­ing fin­ished run­nerup three times since, in­clud­ing last year to Nadal.</p>
    <p>Djokovic said getting back on court for a tour­na­ment so quickly af­ter be­ing dis­qual­i­fied at the US Open for strik­ing a line judge with a ball helped him move on.</p>
    <p>The 33-year-old came i n for heavy crit­i­cism at Flush­ing Mead­ows ear­lier this month and he said he spent sev­eral days pro­cess­ing what had hap­pened.</p>
    <p>“I did ex­pe­ri­ence men­tally some ups and downs in the first four, five days af­ter that hap­pened,” he said.</p>
    <p>“Ob­vi­ously I was in shock... but I moved on, I’ve never had an is­sue in my life to move on re­gard­less of how dif­fi­cult it is.</p>
    <p>“Ob­vi­ously hav­ing a tour­na­ment a week af­ter helped a lot be­cause I re­ally wanted to get on the court and get what­ever trace of that out of the way.”</p>
    <p>Djokovic, who has won 31 of his 32 matches this year, said he would have to raise his game fur­ther to chal­lenge for the French Open crown.</p>
    <p>“I don’t think I played my best ten­nis, to be hon­est, I don’t want to sound ar­ro­gant here. I am very sat­is­fied and pleased to win a ti­tle. I know I still have a cou­ple of gears,” he added.</p>
    <p>“Hope­fully I’ll be able to raise that level for the French Open be­cause that’s go­ing to be nec­es­sary if I want to go deep in the tour­na­ment.”</p>
    <p>Even though he lost (in Rome)... he’s the No. 1 favourite and, the record that he has there, the his­tory of his re­sults, you just can’t put any­body in front of him.</p>
