    <p>SYDNEY • Qan­tas Air­ways re­ported its first loss in six years and pre­dicted it will not make money in the next fi­nan­cial year as travel curbs due to the coro­n­avirus pan­demic smash the air­line in­dus­try.</p>
    <p>Aus­tralia’s na­tional car­rier swung to a full-year net loss of A$1.96 bil­lion (S$1.92 bil­lion) from a profit of A$840 mil­lion a year ear­lier.</p>
    <p>The re­sult re­flects a slump in pas­sen­ger num­bers, the cost of staff lay­offs, and the write­down of the air­line’s en­tire fleet of Air­bus A-380s, re­dun­dant su­per­jum­bos now grounded for three years.</p>
    <p>“The im­pact of Covid on all air­lines is clear. It’s dev­as­tat­ing and it will be a ques­tion of sur­vival for many,” chief ex­ec­u­tive Alan Joyce said in a state­ment. “Re­cov­ery will take time and it will be choppy.”</p>
    <p>Mr Joyce said the air­line does not ex­pect to re­sume in­ter­na­tional op­er­a­tions un­til July next year, and ex­pects a “sig­nif­i­cant un­der­ly­ing loss” in fis­cal 2021.</p>
    <p>Un­der­ly­ing profit be­fore tax, Qan­tas’ pre­ferred mea­sure of earn­ings be­cause it strips out one-time costs, fell 91 per cent to A$124 mil­lion.</p>
    <p>Avi­a­tion’s worst cri­sis has wound back the clock for Mr Joyce, who must turn around the air­line once again after pulling it back from the brink in 2014.</p>
    <p>The Sydney-based car­rier joins loss-mak­ing peers the world over, from Cathay Pa­cific Air­ways and Eti­had Air­ways to Deutsche Lufthansa and Amer­i­can Air­lines Group after a near-de­struc­tion of their nor­mal busi­ness.</p>
    <p>All told, the in­dus­try faces a record US$100 bil­lion (S$137 bil­lion) black hole this year and the next, ac­cord­ing to the In­ter­na­tional Air Trans­port As­so­ci­a­tion. Traf­fic will not re­turn to pre-cri­sis lev­els un­til 2024, the trade group has said.</p>
    <p>Qan­tas has re­peat­edly made deeper cuts as the scale of the cri­sis be­came ap­par­ent in the first half of this year.</p>
    <p>Most re­cently, the air­line in June said it would ask in­vestors for as much as A$1.9 bil­lion, its first eq­uity rais­ing in a decade, and trim at least 6,000 jobs.</p>
    <p>The air­line had A$4.5 bil­lion in avail­able liq­uid­ity at June 30, in­clud­ing A$1 bil­lion of un­drawn fa­cil­i­ties, ac­cord­ing to the state­ment. Net debt stood at A$4.7 bil­lion. It ex­pects fur­ther cuts to cap­i­tal ex­pen­di­ture in the next fi­nan­cial year.</p>
    <p>About 4,000 of the planned 6,000 re­dun­dan­cies will be com­pleted by the end of next month.</p>
