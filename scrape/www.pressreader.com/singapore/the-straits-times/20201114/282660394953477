    <p>NEED FOR PA­TIENCE</p>
    <p>This sea­son we haven’t started the way we would have liked but take noth­ing away from Ole.</p>
    <p>ANDY COLE, ex-Man United striker, on man­ager Ole Gun­nar Sol­sk­jaer (left).</p>
    <p>•</p>
    <p>LON­DON Manch­ester United ex­ec­u­tive vice-chair­man Ed Wood­ward in­sisted on Thurs­day that the club re­main com­mit­ted to man­ager Ole Gun­nar Sol­sk­jaer de­spite a poor start to the sea­son.</p>
    <p>United are lan­guish­ing in 14th in the Premier League ta­ble and a fine start to their Cham­pi­ons League cam­paign came un­stuck with a 2-1 de­feat by Is­tan­bul Basak­se­hir last week.</p>
    <p>“While there is still hard work ahead to achieve greater con­sis­tency, we re­main ab­so­lutely com­mit­ted to the pos­i­tive path we are on un­der Ole as the team con­tinue to de­velop,” said Wood­ward as United re­vealed their first quar­ter fi­nan­cial re­sults for 2020-2021.</p>
    <p>Sol­sk­jaer has come un­der fire for United’s in­con­sis­tent per­for­mances this cam­paign, fol­low­ing a strong late surge last sea­son to fin­ish third in the Premier League.</p>
    <p>For­mer United cap­tain Roy Keane said ear­lier this month that the Nor­we­gian will “pay the price” soon if the Red Devils do not find their feet soon.</p>
    <p>How­ever, the 47-year-old Sol­sk­jaer has also re­ceived back­ing from for­mer team­mate Andy Cole, who played in the same 1999 tre­ble-win­ning team as the United boss.</p>
    <p>“Ole is a very, very nice guy. You don’t want to see any­one given a lot of stick. Since he has gone in he has turned things around,” said Cole ear­lier this week.</p>
    <p>“This sea­son we haven’t started the way we would have liked but take noth­ing away from Ole.</p>
    <p>“Ul­ti­mately, at the back end of last sea­son no­body thought they would fin­ish in the top four. That’s down to the man­ager gal­vanis­ing the play­ers to do just that.”</p>
    <p>Off the pitch, the English giants posted an op­er­at­ing loss of £27 mil­lion (S$47.9 mil­lion), largely due to the loss of match­day rev­enue with games be­ing played be­hind closed doors.</p>
    <p>Com­mer­cial rev­enue was also down 25 per cent due to the club not be­ing able to go on a pre-sea­son tour and a fall in mer­chan­dis­ing sales from no fans on match days.</p>
    <p>How­ever, Wood­ward main­tained that United are com­mit­ted to help­ing lower league clubs through the coro­n­avirus cri­sis.</p>
    <p>Pro­pos­als for wide­spread re­form of English foot­ball led by United and Liver­pool were dis­missed by other Premier League clubs for what was deemed a power grab by the big­gest clubs.</p>
    <p>“We recog­nise that not all foot­ball clubs are in as ro­bust of a fi­nan­cial po­si­tion and that the Premier League has a re­spon­si­bil­ity to sup­port the wider English foot­ball pyra­mid,” added Wood­ward.</p>
    <p>“We will con­tinue to push for this sup­port, both through emer­gency as­sis­tance dur­ing the pan­demic, and through longer-term re­forms to en­sure that the suc­cess of the Premier League is re­in­forced for the ben­e­fit of the na­tional game as a whole.”</p>
