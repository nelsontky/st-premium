    <p>It looks like ride-hail­ing firms Grab and Go­jek are merg­ing. Or one is ac­quir­ing the other.</p>
    <p>Wire news agen­cies have re­ported that the two have been in talks since February. Now that Covid-19 has rav­aged the busi­ness land­scape, there is an­other rea­son for join­ing forces, rather than con­tin­u­ing to com­pete head-on and erod­ing each other’s mar­gins.</p>
    <p>Reuters re­ported that Grab chief ex­ec­u­tive An­thony Tan told staff in an e-mail on Thurs­day that the com­pany was in a po­si­tion to ac­quire an­other.</p>
    <p>Mr Tan, scion of Malaysia’s Tan Chong fam­ily, wrote that “as with any mar­ket con­sol­i­da­tion ru­mours, we are the ones in a po­si­tion to ac­quire”.</p>
    <p>This is in line with what in­sid­ers had said when asked about the merger talks a few months ago.</p>
    <p>But pub­licly, both com­pa­nies are deny­ing this, of course, just as Uber and Grab had de­nied plans for their union right up to the day be­fore they an­nounced it.</p>
    <p>The Com­pe­ti­tion and Con­sumer Com­mis­sion of Sin­ga­pore (CCCS) has come out to say it is look­ing at the new de­vel­op­ment, and pointed out that com­pe­ti­tion rules for­bid such unions if they re­sult in di­min­ished com­pe­ti­tion.</p>
    <p>In a state­ment, the CCCS said it was aware of news re­lat­ing to</p>
    <p>Grab and Go­jek.</p>
    <p>“We are look­ing into the mat­ter and have writ­ten to the par­ties for more in­for­ma­tion,” it said. “Un­der Sin­ga­pore’s com­pe­ti­tion law, Sec­tion 54 of the Com­pe­ti­tion Act pro­hibits merg­ers that have re­sulted, or may be ex­pected to re­sult, in a sub­stan­tial less­en­ing of com­pe­ti­tion.”</p>
    <p>In­done­sia’s com­pe­ti­tion watch­dog had come out in March to say it was not in favour of such a merger. And com­pe­ti­tion bod­ies in other South-east Asian coun­tries where the two firms have a pres­ence are likely to chime in soon as well.</p>
    <p>That’s well and good. But if com­pe­ti­tion watch­dogs find such a deal ob­jec­tion­able in the first place, they should act now – in­stead of af­ter the fact.</p>
    <p>De­spite strong ob­jec­tions from reg­u­la­tory bod­ies, the Grab-Uber deal went through. Yes, both par­ties had to pay hefty fines, but the penal­ties were clearly not a deal-breaker.</p>
    <p>Is this go­ing to be a re­peat, with a for­mal an­nounce­ment of a merger sev­eral weeks from now, fol­lowed by loud protes­ta­tions from reg­u­la­tory bod­ies, and then fines meted out and paid?</p>
    <p>If so, it would make a mock­ery of com­pe­ti­tion laws.</p>
    <p>Of course, it is an­other story al­to­gether if Grab and Go­jek can prove that their union will not di­lute com­pe­ti­tion sub­stan­tially.</p>
    <p>In­deed, Go­jek is strong in its home coun­try In­done­sia, while Grab trails a dis­tance away in terms of app use there. In other re­gional mar­kets – in­clud­ing Sin­ga­pore – it is the other way around.</p>
    <p>So tech­ni­cally, a merger of the two won’t re­ally be hugely detri­men­tal to com­pe­ti­tion any­where.</p>
    <p>It would be akin to FairPrice ac­quir­ing a few min­i­marts here. It would not re­ally af­fect com­pe­ti­tion much, since the gi­ant gro­cer al­ready en­joys more economies of scale than the in­di­vid­ual mom-and-pop shops (even if the lat­ter do oc­ca­sion­ally stock cheaper items).</p>
    <p>But if FairPrice were to merge with Sheng Siong, that would be an­other story.</p>
    <p>Like­wise, a union be­tween Grab and Go­jek is un­likely to dras­ti­cally af­fect com­muters here. Grab is es­ti­mated to have more than 60 per cent of Sin­ga­pore’s ride-hail­ing mar­ket, while Go­jek, a late­comer, prob­a­bly has less than 20 per cent. For de­liv­ery and pay­ments, Grab tow­ers above its ri­val, too.</p>
    <p>Yes, rates and in­cen­tives may change, but they are un­likely to be of the mag­ni­tude seen af­ter the Grab-Uber union.</p>
    <p>But if Grab and Com­fortDelGro were to merge, or McDon­ald’s and KFC or Burger King were to merge, com­pe­ti­tion is likely to go out the win­dow.</p>
    <p>For in­vestors, a merger be­tween Grab and Go­jek will most cer­tainly be wel­come. Af­ter all, dis­rup­tors were not born merely to dis­rupt, but to even­tu­ally make money. That is the endgame – and one which re­quires con­sol­i­da­tion now and then, sooner or later.</p>
    <p>A union be­tween Grab and Go­jek is un­likely to dras­ti­cally af­fect com­muters here... Yes, rates and in­cen­tives may change, but they are un­likely to be of the mag­ni­tude seen af­ter the Grab-Uber union.</p>
