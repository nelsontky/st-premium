    <p>The lo­cal bourse’s key Straits Times In­dex (STI) fell 6.45 points, or 0.26 per cent, to 2,504.76 yes­ter­day, as prices by and large drifted to and fro on di­rec­tion­less au­topi­lot.</p>
    <p>Lack­lus­tre trad­ing vol­umes un­der­pinned stub­born cau­tion that was led by wor­ries over the global econ­omy and the grow­ing USChina spat, while the gen­er­ally un­event­ful at­mos­phere was partly ow­ing to overnight calm – the United States and Canada were en­joy­ing hol­i­days – and a data vac­uum.</p>
    <p>To some ex­tent, Brexit news made up for the lull, with the Bri­tish pound fail­ing to bounce back from Mon­day’s losses af­ter Prime Min­is­ter Boris John­son threat­ened to walk away from trade deal talks with the Euro­pean Union, which re­newed hard-Brexit fears.</p>
    <p>All the same, there has been some grow­ing op­ti­mism of late.</p>
    <p>In a re­cent re­port, Mor­gan Stan­ley said a V-shaped re­cov­ery is play­ing out faster than en­vis­aged and that it ex­pected a faster re­turn to pre-Covid-19 out­put by year-end for the global market economies, and the third quar­ter next year for the de­vel­oped market economies.</p>
    <p>“The out­look for Covid-19’s im­pact on the econ­omy has changed dra­mat­i­cally, with most large economies able to lift eco­nomic ac­tiv­ity to much higher lev­els de­spite the on­go­ing virus spread,” said the bank, adding that “pol­i­cy­mak­ers con­tinue to pro­vide ag­gres­sive sup­port as there are no se­ri­ous moral haz­ard con­cerns this time”.</p>
    <p>All the other ma­jor Asian bourses posted gains on close, from Ja­pan to Hong Kong, China, Tai­wan, South Korea, Aus­tralia and Malaysia.</p>
    <p>In Sin­ga­pore, trad­ing vol­ume on the market to­talled 1.3 bil­lion worth $943 mil­lion from Mon­day’s 1.32 bil­lion shares worth $780.8 mil­lion.</p>
    <p>Losses in the market’s barom­e­ter were led by the Repub­lic’s three bank­ing stal­warts, whose falls col­lec­tively shaved 3.5 in­dex points off the STI.</p>
    <p>Among the STI con­stituents, eight coun­ters closed up, and 18, down.</p>
    <p>Sem­b­corp Marine was one of the top 10 ac­tive coun­ters for the day, with 24 mil­lion shares worth $4.7 mil­lion done. The stock fell 3 per cent to 19.3 cents. Its rights is­sue was un­der­sub­scribed and it is ex­pected that Te­masek will mop up the un­der­sub­scribed por­tion as it had ear­lier agreed to do.</p>
    <p>Raf­fles Ed­u­ca­tion Corp jumped 32 per cent to fin­ish at 15 cents. The stock had risen by as much as 39 per cent yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>When the Sin­ga­pore Ex­change queried th­ese un­usual price move­ments, the pri­vate ed­u­ca­tion provider said it was not aware of any ex­pla­na­tion for the un­usual trad­ing ac­tiv­ity.</p>
