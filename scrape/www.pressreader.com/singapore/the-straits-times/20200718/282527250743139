    <p>• Barcelona have not gone tro­phy­less since 2008, but Lionel Messi has warned that is the di­rec­tion this “very weak” side are headed to­wards.</p>
    <p>Af­ter sur­ren­der­ing the La Liga ti­tle to Real Madrid on Thurs­day, fol­low­ing a 2-1 home l oss to 10-man Osasuna – their sixth de­feat of the cam­paign – the Barca skip­per did not hold back in his at­tack on the team’s men­tal­ity.</p>
    <p>Pre­dict­ing the sec­ond leg of their last-16 Cham­pi­ons League tie with Napoli, which is the only tro­phy they can win this sea­son, would end just as badly if there is no change, Messi said: “The feel­ing of the team is it tries but can’t do it, we leave a lot to be de­sired in many ar­eas.</p>
    <p>“I said long ago that if we con­tin­ued in this way, it would be very dif­fi­cult to win the Cham­pi­ons League and that has been shown to be the case in La Liga too.</p>
    <p>“If we want to fight for the Cham­pi­ons League, we will have to change a lot be­cause oth­er­wise, the match against Napoli, we will lose that as well. We didn’t ex­pect or want to fin­ish like this, but it al­most sums up the whole year. We have been very in­con­sis­tent, beaten on in­ten­sity or de­sire.</p>
    <p>“Af­ter the break, Madrid have not lost any games and they de­serve credit for that but we have also helped them a lot.</p>
    <p>“We lost a lot of games that we should not have lost and we have to be self-crit­i­cal, start­ing with the play­ers...”</p>
    <p>The tie with Napoli is finely bal­anced at 1-1 go­ing into the Nou Camp leg next month, but Barca coach Quique Se­tien ad­mit­ted that he “does not know” if he will still be in charge then.</p>
