    <p>• United States Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump said he would ac­cept a peace­ful trans­fer of power if he loses the elec­tion, but that the polls must be “hon­est”, CNN re­ported on Thurs­day.</p>
    <p>The guarded re­sponse was made af­ter he hes­i­tated for weeks to make the com­mit­ment of a peace­ful trans­fer.</p>
    <p>He con­tin­ued to sow doubt over the elec­tion re­sults on Thurs­day, CNN said, and made base­less claims about Obama ad­min­is­tra­tion of­fi­cials spy­ing on his 2016 cam­paign in an NBC town hall held at the Perez Art Museum in Mi­ami.</p>
    <p>“They spied heav­ily on my cam­paign and they tried to take down a duly elected sit­ting pres­i­dent, and then they talk about ‘will you ac­cept a peace­ful trans­fer?’</p>
    <p>“And the an­swer is, yes, I will, but I want it to be an hon­est elec­tion and so does ev­ery­body else,” Mr Trump said.</p>
    <p>He added: “When I see thou­sands of bal­lots dumped in a garbage can and they hap­pen to have my name on it, I’m not happy about it.”</p>
    <p>Mr Trump, in his ex­change with NBC’s Sa­van­nah Guthrie, made a va­ri­ety of false claims about “un­so­licited” and “fraud­u­lent bal­lots”.</p>
    <p>When pre­sented with the claim by his own Fed­eral Bureau of In­ves­ti­ga­tion di­rec­tor Christo­pher A. Wray that there is no ev­i­dence of wide­spread voter fraud, he again took a swipe at Mr Wray, say­ing: “Oh re­ally? Then he’s not do­ing a very good job.”</p>
    <p>Asked why he seemed to be lay­ing the ground­work for doubt in the elec­tion re­sults, the Pres­i­dent said, as quoted by CNN: “I don’t want that to hap­pen.”</p>
