    <p>Shares of Top Glove sank to a three-month low yesterday fol­low­ing news that the world’s big­gest glove maker had fired a whistle­blower be­fore the Covid-19 out­break at its fac­to­ries.</p>
    <p>The main­board-listed counter tum­bled as much as 5.7 per cent to $2.15 at around 9.57am on the Singapore bourse. The last time the counter closed be­low this level was on Sept 10 at $2.13.</p>
    <p>The stock re­cov­ered slightly to close at $2.19 yesterday, or 3.95 per cent lower with 5.37 mil­lion shares chang­ing hands.</p>
    <p>A Top Glove em­ployee in Malaysia had taken two pho­tos in May of his co-work­ers crowd­ing into one of the com­pany’s fac­to­ries, but was fired in Septem­ber for shar­ing them, Reuters re­ported on Sun­day.</p>
    <p>The pho­tos showed dozens of work­ers lined up less than 1m apart to have their tem­per­a­tures checked be­fore start­ing their night shift.</p>
    <p>Although the com­pany re­quired ev­ery­one to wear masks and gloves, the whis­tle-blower and five other work­ers told Reuters that so­cial dis­tanc­ing was not en­forced or fol­lowed out­side the fac­tory.</p>
    <p>Al­most three months later, Top Glove’s com­plex of fac­to­ries and dor­mi­to­ries in Klang has be­come Malaysia’s largest Covid-19 clus­ter with more than 5,000 in­fec­tions, the au­thor­i­ties said on Dec 1.</p>
    <p>The com­pany con­firmed last Wed­nes­day that 5,147 work­ers at</p>
    <p>its Klang fac­to­ries had tested pos­i­tive for the coro­n­avirus. That is dou­ble the 2,453 pos­i­tive cases among Top Glove em­ploy­ees an­nounced late last month.</p>
    <p>The Malaysian gov­ern­ment said then that it would tem­po­rar­ily close in stages 28 of Top Glove’s man­u­fac­tur­ing fa­cil­i­ties in Klang to screen and quar­an­tine work­ers.</p>
    <p>This comes as a Nepali se­cu­rity guard work­ing for the com­pany is be­lieved to have died of Covid-19.</p>
    <p>Mr Yam Narayan Chaud­hary died last Satur­day, af­ter he was ad­mit­ted to hos­pi­tal on Nov 21, re­ported Malaysia’s The Star yesterday.</p>
    <p>The gov­ern­ment has also opened 19 in­ves­ti­ga­tion pa­pers into six Top Glove sub­sidiaries over of­fences in­volv­ing work­ers’ dor­mi­to­ries.</p>
    <p>The com­pany is be­ing in­ves­ti­gated for vi­o­la­tions of the Work­ers’ Min­i­mum Stan­dards of Hous­ing and Ameni­ties Act.</p>
    <p>If found guilty, Top Glove may have to fork out a RM50,000 ($16,480) fine for each of­fence.</p>
    <p>On Dec 9, dur­ing a press con­fer­ence to dis­cuss its first-quar­ter earn­ings, Top Glove said it was plan­ning to re­duce its de­pen­dence on for­eign work­ers and em­ploy more lo­cals.</p>
    <p>The com­pany said then that in FY2021, it aims to re­cruit 9,000 em­ploy­ees com­pris­ing 7,000 new or ex­pe­ri­enced hires – of whom 4,500 will be lo­cals – as well as 2,000 in­terns and trainees.</p>
    <p>The com­pany’s net profit surged to RM2.38 bil­lion for its first quar­ter ended last month, about 21 times that of RM111.4 mil­lion in the year-ago pe­riod.</p>
