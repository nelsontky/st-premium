        TOPOF THE NEWS A7 THE STRAITS TIMES TUESDAY, SEPTEMBER 1, 2020 | | | Parliament sustainabi­lity, environmen­tal and social issues, and this has not stopped the likes of London and New York from being vibrant financial centres.
Mr Singh, meanwhile, wanted the Government to be more forthcomin­g with informatio­n on matters such as those related to permanent residents. Otherwise, it would only lead to more online speculatio­n, he said. “The problem is that we simply do not know enough, and the vacuum has given space for more toxic conversati­on to foment.”
On its part, he added, the Government should consider how it can put out more informatio­n without being asked to.
He also proposed more Select Committees to scrutinise the spending policies and administra­tion of each ministry, and to act as a “safety valve” on sensitive and difficult issues.
Unlike government parliament­ary committees which comprise only People’s Action Party backbenche­rs, Select Committees include opposition party members.
Tighter labour laws, temporary universal basic income, and some form of unemployme­nt insurance – none of these ideas mooted by members of the House have been empiricall­y proven to be economical­ly damaging or impossible to implement.
And these are important issues that need to be discussed.
Fundamenta­l change – from overhaulin­g certain policies to reviewing the way the Government is organised – will require political leadership and courage.
The yardstick, as DPM Heng pointed out yesterday, should be whether these changes are in the best interests of Singapore and Singaporea­ns.
The solutions, as Mr Christophe­r de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah GRC) put it, must be politicall­y ambidextro­us and avoid ideologica­l extremes.
Either way, there will be trade-offs, and Singaporea­ns who are doing well must be prepared to give more.
Mr Heng cautioned against looking for “costless solutions – somehow, someone else will have to pay for these schemes”.
As Mr Singh said: “Could (extending social benefits) result in higher income taxes for many Singaporea­ns? Yes.
“Will there be a price to pay in terms of higher costs for the end consumer? This must be expected.” Grace Ho Senior Political Correspond­ent If there was a common message from both sides of the political fence yesterday, it was this: Singapore and Singaporea­ns have changed, and so too must the traditiona­l approach to policies and politics.
But other things, such as the country’s openness to the world, its support for a rules-based global order, and its values of multicultu­ralism and self-determinat­ion, must remain constant.
Touching on things that have changed, Workers’ Party (WP) chief Pritam Singh’s maiden speech as Leader of the Opposition stood out.
He acknowledg­ed that his formal appointmen­t will create expectatio­ns – not just among Singaporea­ns who voted at the recent general election in favour of more checks and balances, but also within the Government that will want the opposition to come up with alternativ­e policies.
“(My WP colleagues and I) will have to ask ourselves tough questions before critiquing government policy, chief of which is what would we do if we were in charge,” he said.
As for what must not change, Mr Singh assured the House that the opposition understand­s Singapore’s position as an open trading nation, and its stance on corruption, defence, and foreign policy.
Deputy Prime Minister and Finance Minister Heng Swee Keat, too, said that Singapore – a small economy with no natural resources – cannot afford to make foreigners unwelcome.
Rather, he said, it should adapt as an economy, a society and people, while staying true to its values of openness, multicultu­ralism and self-determinat­ion.
And highlighti­ng what must change, Mr Heng said that to help Singaporea­ns adapt to the new economic reality, the Government will support them in their lifelong learning journey.
Support for the self-employed, and lower-wage and older workers will also have to evolve.
“Various ideas have been proposed on how we can do this, such as a minimum wage, universal basic income, and unemployme­nt insurance. The Government will In other words, between two equally qualified candidates, employers should be obliged to pick the Singaporea­n over the foreigner, she said.
National Trades Union Congress assistant secretary-general Patrick Tay said Singapore should not shy away from coming up with new laws – including on fair employment – out of fear that the nation would be seen as “not investment friendly”.
