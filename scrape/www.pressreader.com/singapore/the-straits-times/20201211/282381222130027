    <p>• The Na­tional Hockey League likely will fea­ture a new look when it be­gins the 2020-21 sea­son.</p>
    <p>Com­mis­sioner Gary Bettman con­firmed that the league in­tends to tem­po­rar­ily realign its di­vi­sions ahead of the new sea­son, com­plete with the seven Canada-based teams linked in the same group.</p>
    <p>The po­ten­tial realign­ment is in­flu­enced by the Canada-United States bor­der be­ing closed to non-es­sen­tial travel due to the coro­n­avirus pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Bor­der re­stric­tions have forced the Na­tional Bas­ket­ball As­so­ci­a­tion’s Toronto Rap­tors, Ma­jor League Baseball’s Toronto Blue Jays and all three Cana­dian Ma­jor League Soc­cer clubs to tem­po­rar­ily re­lo­cate to the US.</p>
    <p>“There are a lot of things we have to do to re­turn to play,” Bettman told The Mac­cabi USA Sports Show. “For us to re­turn to play, we’re not go­ing to play 82 games, ob­vi­ously...</p>
    <p>“You can’t go back and forth, so we’re ac­tu­ally go­ing to have to realign. If ev­ery­thing stays the way it is, we’re prob­a­bly go­ing to have to have a Cana­dian division and realign in the US.”</p>
    <p>A seven-team, all-Cana­dian division would com­prise pro­vin­cial ri­vals Cal­gary Flames and Ed­mon­ton Oil­ers, as well as the Mon­treal Cana­di­ens, Ot­tawa Sen­a­tors, Toronto Maple Leafs, Van­cou­ver Canucks and Win­nipeg Jets.</p>
    <p>All but the Sen­a­tors qual­i­fied for the post-sea­son in 2019-20. That would leave the 24 US-based teams, who likely will be shuf­fled into three, eight-club di­vi­sions based on ge­og­ra­phy, while ex­pan­sion team Seat­tle Kraken will be­gin play in the 2021-22 sea­son.</p>
    <p>The NHL has yet to an­nounce an of­fi­cial start day for the up­com­ing sea­son. Mul­ti­ple me­dia out­lets, how­ever, re­ported that the league and the Play­ers’ As­so­ci­a­tion are fi­nal­is­ing a plan to start on Jan 13. Per re­ports, a 52- or 56-game sched­ule has been pro­posed.</p>
    <p>All games will ini­tially be played be­hind closed doors, as was the case when the league restarted in Au­gust after a five-month hia­tus.</p>
    <p>The lack of rev­enue from ticket sales and con­ces­sions has led to the av­er­age value of the 31 fran­chises de­clin­ing for the first time since 2001, ac­cord­ing to Forbes on Wed­nes­day.</p>
    <p>The magazine said the fig­ure fell 2 per cent dur­ing the past year to US$653 mil­lion (S$873.5 mil­lion), while league rev­enue to­talled US$4.4 bil­lion, 14 per cent less than the pre­vi­ous year.</p>
    <p>For us to re­turn to play, we’re not go­ing to play 82 games, ob­vi­ously, and we have travel is­sues be­cause of the re­stric­tions at the bor­der be­tween Canada and the US.</p>
    <p>GARY BETTMAN, NHL com­mis­sioner, on the Covid im­pact.</p>
