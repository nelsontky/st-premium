    <p>Malaysia’s for­mer premier Ma­hathir Mo­hamad says he can­not rec­on­cile with his suc­ces­sor and erst­while ally Muhyid­din Yassin, be­cause the Prime Min­is­ter is ply­ing the same pol­i­tics that both of them had sought to re­form when they de­feated the Na­jib Razak-led gov­ern­ment at the polls more than two years ago.</p>
    <p>The 95-year-old, who many here con­sider an el­der states­man, hav­ing served as prime min­is­ter for 24 years with two stints in of­fice, told The Straits Times that Tan Sri Muhyid­din “has adopted the kind of strat­egy that Na­jib had, un­der­min­ing all those who are against him”.</p>
    <p>Mr Muhyid­din, for­merly Umno deputy pres­i­dent, was among a raft of lead­ers sacked by the party in 2016 af­ter crit­i­cis­ing its leader Na­jib over the 1Malaysia De­vel­op­ment Ber­had scan­dal.</p>
    <p>He later co-founded Parti Pribumi Ber­satu Malaysia with Tun Dr Ma­hathir, also a for­mer Umno leader.</p>
    <p>Ber­satu later be­came part of the Pakatan Hara­pan (PH) op­po­si­tion pact that tri­umphed at the May 2018 Gen­eral Elec­tion.</p>
    <p>PH col­lapsed in March af­ter dozens of law­mak­ers, in­clud­ing those from Ber­satu, de­fected and backed the Perikatan Na­sional gov­ern­ment (PN) led by Mr Muhyid­din. Dr Ma­hathir re­signed as prime min­is­ter, and his chair­man­ship and mem­ber­ship of Ber­satu were later ter­mi­nated.</p>
    <p>Dr Ma­hathir said in an in­ter­view last Fri­day that “for three months... I didn’t make any com­ment”, but he even­tu­ally broke his si­lence as he thought the cor­rup­tion he had sought to fight had re­turned. Dr Ma­hathir him­self has been ac­cused of crony­ism and nepo­tism, al­le­ga­tions that he dis­misses.</p>
    <p>“We helped a lot of peo­ple whether we know or don’t know them,” he told ST. “Hun­dreds and thou­sands of them were helped. Some of them ac­tu­ally took advantage and are do­ing well. But the moment some­body suc­ceeds, (the ac­cu­sa­tion is) that is my crony.”</p>
    <p>Money pol­i­tics, where favours are ex­changed for power, has been a con­stant bug­bear in Malaysia, even dur­ing Dr Ma­hathir’s ini­tial ten­ure as prime min­is­ter from 1981 to 2003. As Umno pres­i­dent then, he headed the rul­ing Barisan Na­sional coali­tion.</p>
    <p>Umno has backed PN, help­ing Mr Muhyid­din stay in of­fice with 113 seats in the 222-seat Par­lia­ment.</p>
    <p>Na­jib re­mains an in­flu­en­tial pres­ence in Umno even though he was convicted of seven counts of graft in July and sen­tenced to 12 years in prison. He re­mains an MP, pend­ing an ap­peal against the ver­dict.</p>
    <p>“How can I ac­cept Muhyid­din like that?” said Dr Ma­hathir, who added that the Premier is will­ing to work with Mr Na­jib be­cause “pol­i­tics is more im­por­tant than prin­ci­ples”.</p>
    <p>Nev­er­the­less, Dr Ma­hathir con­cedes that he and the other op­po­si­tion par­ties are not in a po­si­tion to chal­lenge Mr Muhyid­din’s par­lia­men­tary ma­jor­ity as they are split on who should take over as premier.</p>
    <p>Op­po­si­tion leader An­war Ibrahim has made a bid for the top job but has yet to back up his claim that he com­mands enough sup­port in the fed­eral leg­is­la­ture.</p>
    <p>“An­war has a lot of peo­ple who are against him. If I am not ac­cepted, many (of my sup­port­ers) will pull out so he will not have the ma­jor­ity. Now he claims he has the sup­port of 20 to 30 MPs, but ev­ery­body has de­nied it,” Dr Ma­hathir said of his for­mer pro­tege-turned­neme­sis, with whom he formed an un­easy al­liance to win the 2018 elec­tion.</p>
    <p>De­spite this, Dr Ma­hathir does not agree with hold­ing a snap elec­tion now, as he does not think ei­ther side would be able to se­cure a stronger man­date from it.</p>
    <p>This is be­cause the pub­lic is not yet ready to vote on sub­stan­tive is­sues fol­low­ing the po­lit­i­cal tur­moil of re­cent months, he said, and would make their choice “not be­cause the party is good”, but based on his­tor­i­cal sen­ti­ment.</p>
    <p>“The same peo­ple will be elected and you will find that there will be a hung Par­lia­ment or a very small ma­jor­ity,” said the vet­eran of 10 gen­eral elec­tions.</p>
    <p>“Like now, if three per­sons have stom­ach aches and didn’t at­tend Par­lia­ment, they will fall. What kind of gov­ern­ment is that?” he added.</p>
    <p>Speak­ing about Malaysia’s con­tro­ver­sial af­fir­ma­tive ac­tion poli­cies that have largely ben­e­fited the Malay ma­jor­ity, Dr Ma­hathir said they could be done away with if the coun­try had stayed the course to be­come a de­vel­oped na­tion with a nar­row wealth gap by this year.</p>
    <p>But en­demic cor­rup­tion has ham­pered progress to­wards de­vel­op­ing the econ­omy and at­tempts to re­dis­tribute wealth that be­gan half a cen­tury ago un­der the con­tro­ver­sial New Eco­nomic Pol­icy, he said.</p>
    <p>“If you re­duce the dis­par­ity, the jeal­ousy, the envy will be re­duced. The coun­try will be sta­ble, then the coun­try will grow,” he said.</p>
    <p>“When the dif­fer­ence in terms of wealth is not so big, it is all right. We can do away with that (af­fir­ma­tive ac­tion).”</p>
