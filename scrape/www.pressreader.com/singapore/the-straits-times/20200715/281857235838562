    <p>The Philip­pines, Malaysia, Viet­nam and In­done­sia are likely to stay the course, de­spite the United States’ “full-throated” back­ing of an in­ter­na­tional rul­ing dis­miss­ing China’s claims to nearly all of the South China Sea.</p>
    <p>“The great pow­ers, as they es­ca­late their ri­valry, will woo us into their side. But we will ad­vance our own na­tional in­ter­est,” Mr Harry Roque, spokesman for Pres­i­dent</p>
    <p>Ro­drigo Duterte, said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>He said while the Philip­pines stands by the 2016 rul­ing against China, “this is not the sum to­tal of our re­la­tions… We will just have to agree to dis­agree”. The Philip­pines is con­test­ing China’s claims over wa­ters it con­sid­ers part of its exclusive eco­nomic zone (EEZ).</p>
    <p>China’s vast claims also over­lap with those of Viet­nam, Malaysia, Brunei and Tai­wan.</p>
    <p>For­eign Sec­re­tary Teodoro Loc­sin yes­ter­day held a video call with Chi­nese For­eign Min­is­ter Wang Yi.</p>
    <p>Mr Wang noted that with the joint ef­forts of China and Asean coun­tries, the sit­u­a­tion in the South China Sea has gen­er­ally re­mained sta­ble. But, he said, the US “out of its own geopo­lit­i­cal needs, wor­ries only if the South China Sea is not chaotic”.</p>
    <p>The US on Mon­day for­mally re­jected China’s claims to off­shore re­sources in most of the South China Sea.</p>
    <p>Malaysia is un­likely to “be­come very gung-ho and push for­ward and con­front China”, Univer­siti Malaya’s In­sti­tute of China Stud­ies di­rec­tor Ngeow Chow-Bing said.</p>
    <p>“The US state­ment is a for­mal ex­pres­sion of what Wash­ing­ton has al­ready been prac­tis­ing for years.”</p>
    <p>Hanoi-based an­a­lyst Ha Hoang Hop said he does not ex­pect the US’ stance to make any dif­fer­ence on the ground. “The US will con­tinue to ex­er­cise lim­ited Fonops (free­dom of nav­i­ga­tion op­er­a­tions) and pos­si­bly take other ac­tions.</p>
    <p>“Even though the risk of mil­i­tary con­flict is higher, I ex­pect China and the US to hedge these risks.”</p>
    <p>In­done­sia, which is not a claimant state but has clashed with China over fish­ing rights around the north­ern is­lands of Natuna, said its po­si­tion re­mains “firm and con­sis­tent”. For­eign Af­fairs Min­istry spokesman Teuku Faiza­syah said: “Any coun­try’s sup­port for In­done­sia’s rights con­cern­ing Natuna’s wa­ters is nor­mal, as our po­si­tion is based on Unclos.” He was re­fer­ring to the UN Con­ven­tion on the Law of the Seas, which de­lin­eates EEZs that coun­tries may claim.</p>
    <p>The Philip­pines brought a case against China in The Hague in 2013, ar­gu­ing that China’s so-called ninedash line that marks its claims to nearly all of the South China Sea runs against Unclos. The Hague tri­bunal sided with the Philip­pines in 2016, and dis­missed China’s claims.</p>
    <p>US Sec­re­tary of State Mike Pom­peo, in­vok­ing the 2016 rul­ing on Mon­day, sided with South-east Asian na­tions, af­ter years of Wash­ing­ton say­ing it took no po­si­tion on the mer­its of dis­putes be­tween China and each of its South-east Asian neigh­bours. Still, some an­a­lysts say the US’ lat­est in­volve­ment may just be a short-term blus­ter and not a per­ma­nent pol­icy goal.</p>
