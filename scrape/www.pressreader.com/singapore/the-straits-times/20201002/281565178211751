    <p>Sin­ga­porean col­lec­tor Nor­man Cho (be­low, left) – who has more than 300 pieces of Per­anakan jew­ellery – has pub­lished a book ti­tled</p>
    <p>The Be­jew­elled Lives Of The Per­anakans. Book de­signer</p>
    <p>Chris Loh trans­formed his raw man­u­script into a 220-page tome and helped “fill in the blanks” of the col­lec­tion with pieces from her own Per­anakan jew­ellery col­lec­tion.</p>
    <p>Mr Nor­man Cho vividly re­mem­bers his grand­mother l ay­ing out her Per­anakan j ewellery on the bed be­fore at­tend­ing fam­ily func­tions and ask­ing her grand­son to pick out pieces to go with her out­fit.</p>
    <p>There were glitzy pieces of kerosang rantay (Malay for brooches strung to a chain), loket (pen­dants), chinchin wa­jek (di­a­mond-shaped rings) and an as­sort­ment of gold and sil­ver belts with or­nate, de­tach­able buck­les.</p>
    <p>“She was un­wit­tingly train­ing my eye for beau­ti­ful pieces of jew­ellery,” says the 49-year-old, who works full-time as an ad­min­is­tra­tive of­fi­cer at the Na­tional En­vi­ron­ment Agency.</p>
    <p>From 20 pieces in­her­ited from his Nonya grand­mother Mrs Cho Kim Leong, who died in 1995 at the age of 82, Mr Cho has ex­panded his col­lec­tion of Per­anakan, or “Straits­born”, jew­ellery to more than 300 pieces to­day.</p>
    <p>His col­lec­tion is metic­u­lously de­tailed in a new book ti­tled The Be­jew­elled Lives Of The Per­anakans, which Mr Cho self-pub­lished. It was re­leased on Aug 24.</p>
    <p>The fam­ily’s heir­loom col­lec­tion started when his grand­mother saw the value of col­lect­ing Per­anakan pieces.</p>
    <p>Mr Cho’s Baba grand­fa­ther, an owner of a rub­ber plan­ta­tion, who lived at 421 Joo Chiat Road around the early 1900s, had to buy his wife at least one piece of bling a month to keep her happy.</p>
    <p>“My grand­mother, whose fa­ther owned a sec­ond-hand j ewellery shop at 674 North Bridge Road, grew up sur­rounded by jew­ellery,” he says.</p>
    <p>“She in­sisted my grand­fa­ther buy her bling ev­ery month or else she would give him the cold shoul­der,” he re­calls.</p>
    <p>How­ever, she had to sell most of her jew­ellery when she was wid­owed af­ter the Ja­pa­nese Oc­cu­pa­tion in Sin­ga­pore in 1945, he adds.</p>
    <p>To­day, Mr Cho’s pri­vate col­lec­tion of tra­di­tional Per­anakan jew­ellery in­cludes the old­est piece, a 19th-cen­tury i ntan (di­a­mond­stud­ded) gold brooch in the shape of the Bud­dha’s Hand cit­rus fruit, also called a “cit­reon”, which the</p>
    <p>Chi­nese as­so­ciate with hap­pi­ness, longevity and good for­tune.</p>
    <p>“I think the in­trin­sic her­itage value of these pieces far sur­passes the mone­tary value,” says Mr Cho. “How much I am will­ing to spend on a piece de­pends on how much I value the his­tory, rar­ity and aes­thetic al­lure of each piece.”</p>
    <p>Mr Cho started doc­u­ment­ing his col­lec­tion in 2017 through books, the In­ter­net and in­ter­views with relatives, the Per­anakan com­mu­nity and peo­ple in the jew­ellery busi­ness in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>He was also more in­ter­ested in the hu­man sto­ries be­hind the jew­ellery such as how, de­spite his grand­mother’s love of jew­ellery, she had to liq­ui­date most of her col­lec­tion when her hus­band died just af­ter the war, leav­ing her a young widow. It was the sales from the jew­ellery that helped raise Mr Cho’s fa­ther and his brother who were less than 10 years old at the time.</p>
    <p>When he met book de­signer Chris Loh at a din­ner party early last year, the project be­gan to gain trac­tion.</p>
    <p>“He told me he al­ready had the manuscript­s, but was told by lo­cal pub­lish­ers they were in­ter­ested only in cook­books,” says Ms Loh, founder of Chris De­sign House, a de­sign com­pany.</p>
    <p>“This is truly a pas­sion project for me,” says Ms Loh, 53, who trans­formed Mr Cho’s raw man­u­script into a 220-page tome and helped “fill in the blanks” of the col­lec­tion with pieces from her own Per­anakan jew­ellery col­lec­tion, which she amassed af­ter her mar­riage to a Per­anakan.</p>
    <p>She said she took just one look at Mr Cho’s jew­ellery col­lec­tion and could vi­su­alise the en­tire for­mat, right down to fonts, pho­tog­ra­phy, pa­per qual­ity and pack­ag­ing al­most in­stantly.</p>
    <p>The book comes in two ver­sions.</p>
    <p>The hard­cover was de­signed within three months from Septem­ber last year. Ms Loh art di­rected, as well as de­signed the book with Mr Barry Ng, who also did the pho­tog­ra­phy. The book was edited by Mr Peter Teo and Mrs Lyn Say­ers.</p>
    <p>The soft­cover book was com­pleted in Jan­uary this year, but did not make it to the print­ing presses as sched­uled when the coro­n­avirus pan­demic hit.</p>
    <p>From Fe­bru­ary to June, Ms Loh and Mr Cho worked on the book’s de­sign be­fore print­ing re­sumed in July be­fore the re­lease on Face­book on Aug 24, where de­tails of the book such as its avail­abil­ity were pub­lished.</p>
    <p>While there are plans to sell it at book­stores, for now, the book is avail­able at Per­anakan-themed out­lets such as True Blue Cui­sine in Ar­me­nian Street, Rumah Bebe in East Coast Road and Asian Artistry Fine Jew­ellery at Jewel Changi Air­port.</p>
    <p>This is the sec­ond lo­cally pro­duced book on Per­anakan jew­ellery af­ter the sem­i­nal Gild­ing The Phoenix: The Straits Chi­nese And Their Jew­ellery in 1991 by Ed­mond Chin, an Oxford grad­u­ate and for­mer guest cu­ra­tor at the Na­tional Mu­seum. He went on to head the j ewellery and jadeite depart­ment for Asia at Christie’s in Hong Kong, where he is based as a jew­ellery de­signer and owner of Etcetera De­sign.</p>
    <p>For the cover of The Be­jew­elled Lives Of The Per­anakans, Mr Cho and Ms Loh de­cided on an or­nate deer-mo­tif pen­dant with in­tri­cate trac­ery work bathed in a turquoise back­ground colour.</p>
    <p>“My favourite piece is the deer brooch, which was my first ma­jor pur­chase,” says Mr Cho.</p>
    <p>“I was cap­ti­vated by the in­tri­cate work­man­ship and re­alised that the deer mo­tif was rather rare on a brooch. The deer also sig­ni­fies longevity and pros­per­ity i n the Chi­nese cus­tom and is a pop­u­lar Vic­to­rian mo­tif.”</p>
    <p>He ex­plains that much of the jew­ellery of the Per­anakans had Malay roots, which ab­sorb colo­nial in­flu­ences from Portugal, Spain and the Nether­lands. They were fused with lo­cal and ori­en­tal mo­tifs and adopted Vic­to­rian de­signs that were em­blem­atic of the Bri­tish.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­porean scholar of Per­anakan art and cul­ture Peter Lee, who wrote the fore­word to the book, says peo­ple in the old days were never as bor­ing and rigid in their ways as be­lieved. The idea of “Per­anakan” is dy­namic and not static, he says.</p>
    <p>“Tra­di­tion is a modern fic­tion,” Mr Lee, 57, tells The Straits Times. He is the son of the late Lee Kip Lee, for­mer Per­anakan As­so­ci­a­tion</p>
    <p>My grand­mother, whose fa­ther owned a sec­ond-hand jew­ellery shop... grew up sur­rounded by jew­ellery. She in­sisted my grand­fa­ther buy her bling ev­ery month or else she would give him the cold shoul­der.</p>
    <p>pres­i­dent, and younger brother of singer-com­poser Dick Lee.</p>
    <p>He has also au­thored the 2014 book, Sarong Ke­baya: Per­anakan Fash­ion In An In­ter­con­nected World 1500-1950 and con­sults and cu­rates on an ad hoc ba­sis with Sin­ga­pore mu­se­ums.</p>
    <p>“Per­anakan jew­ellery has also al­ways been evolving. We just have to work hard to re-ed­u­cate younger peo­ple about the true na­ture of Asia’s con­stantly evolving past.</p>
    <p>“By lib­er­at­ing the past, we can truly con­nect it with the present. Only then can we in Asia in­te­grate our his­tory with our com­plex, con­tem­po­rary, glob­alised selves.”</p>
