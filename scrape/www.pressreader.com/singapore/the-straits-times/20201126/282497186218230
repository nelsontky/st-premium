    <p>• Andy Mur­ray be­lieves that all ten­nis play­ers should be re­quired to have a coro­n­avirus vac­ci­na­tion be­fore they are al­lowed to take part in tour­na­ments.</p>
    <p>With next year’s ten­nis sched­ule fac­ing in­evitable is­sues with the Covid-19 pan­demic, the Bri­tish three-time Grand Slam win­ner hopes the long-awaited vac­cine will be avail­able by spring and that a com­pul­sory pro­gramme is rolled out within the sport.</p>
    <p>“I think that prob­a­bly should be the case. I would hope that all the play­ers would be will­ing to do that for the good of the sport – pro­vid­ing ev­ery­thing has proved to be safe, clin­i­cal tri­als and ev­ery­thing have been done, and there are not any sig­nif­i­cant side ef­fects,” Mur­ray said on Tues­day.</p>
    <p>World No. 1 No­vak Djokovic gen­er­ated head­lines ear­lier this year for his anti-vac­cine com­ments. The Serb later said he was not against vac­ci­na­tions but did not like the idea of be­ing forced to have one.</p>
    <p>Mur­ray ad­mit­ted it would be dif­fi­cult to force play­ers to be vac­ci­nated, but he still hopes that com­mon sense pre­vails. “I guess it would be dif­fi­cult. I also read a few weeks af­ter he’d said he (Djokovic) wouldn’t be keen on do­ing that, if it was some­thing that had to be done for him to play the sport, he would,” the Scot said. “So I guess we’ll have to wait and see what the ATP and the ITF (In­ter­na­tional Ten­nis Fed­er­a­tion) de­cide their po­si­tion is go­ing to be on that.</p>
    <p>“But I’m con­fi­dent that play­ers would be into it if it meant the Tour go­ing back to nor­mal­ity.”</p>
    <p>Strict quar­an­tine rules in Aus­tralia have cast doubt on the vi­a­bil­ity of the Aus­tralian Open, with play­ers not able to ar­rive in the coun­try un­til the end of De­cem­ber at the ear­li­est and then re­quired to quar­an­tine for two weeks.</p>
    <p>Dis­cus­sions are on­go­ing over whether they will be able to train or com­pete while un­der quar­an­tine, and Mur­ray is an­tic­i­pat­ing that the first Slam of the year will be pushed back from its planned start on Jan 18.</p>
    <p>“It’s ob­vi­ously tricky for the play­ers. Orig­i­nally, we planned to go on the 12th or the 13th of De­cem­ber to ar­rive around the 15th,” the 33-year-old said. “Then that changed and the lat­est I’ve heard is they’ve planned to push it back a cou­ple of weeks. That would be the best-case sce­nario now.</p>
    <p>“That would al­low the play­ers to get over there at the be­gin­ning of Jan­uary and pre­pare prop­erly for the event. I’ll go as soon as I can.”</p>
