    <p>Dur­ing the two-month cir­cuit breaker pe­riod from April 7, most peo­ple in Sin­ga­pore stayed home as much as pos­si­ble to fight Covid-19.</p>
    <p>For Jane (not her real name), who does not have a good re­la­tion­ship with her par­ents, it meant be­ing stuck with them every day.</p>
    <p>The 19-year-old had dif­fi­cul­ties with their in­tru­sive­ness.</p>
    <p>“Hav­ing to be at home was dif­fi­cult as she had no sense of per­sonal space, both phys­i­cal and psy­cho­log­i­cal, ” said Dr Cor­nelia Chee, head of the psy­cho­log­i­cal medicine depart­ment at the Na­tional Univer­sity of Sin­ga­pore and Na­tional Univer­sity Hospi­tal.</p>
    <p>Jane’s case was among sev­eral Dr Chee cited to il­lus­trate the pan­demic’s im­pact on men­tal health.</p>
    <p>Th­ese peo­ple ex­pe­ri­enced height­ened stress as Covid-19 dis­rupted life­styles and liveli­hoods.</p>
    <p>Ex­perts warn that men­tal-health stresses can rise and prob­lems can de­velop as the pan­demic drags on.</p>
    <p>Those who are more vul­ner­a­ble in­clude the low-in­come groups, said Dr Chee. Oth­ers in­clude work­ing moth­ers with young chil­dren, front-line and mi­grant work­ers, those with ex­ist­ing men­tal-health con­di­tions and the el­derly who are al­ready so­cially iso­lated.</p>
    <p>Dr Chee said there was a woman with dis­so­cia­tive iden­tity dis­or­der, which is char­ac­terised by a pa­tient hav­ing mul­ti­ple per­son­al­i­ties.</p>
    <p>When she needed help, she could not see her ther­a­pist in per­son. Video con­sul­ta­tions were not pos­si­ble as she felt there were too many peo­ple at home to give her the pri­vacy she needed for the ses­sion.</p>
    <p>While Sin­ga­pore has recorded more than 54,000 Covid-19 in­fec­tions, the mor­tal­ity rate is be­low 0.1 per cent. But it is not known how many peo­ple’s men­tal health have been im­pacted by the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>ANX­I­ETY AND DE­PRES­SION</p>
    <p>Dr Goh Kah Hong, head and se­nior con­sul­tant of psy­cho­log­i­cal medicine at Khoo Teck Puat Hospi­tal, said there are more peo­ple fight­ing anx­i­ety or de­pres­sion, as higher stress lev­els can re­sult from the fear of con­tract­ing the ill­ness or the con­se­quences of the pan­demic, such as job losses or fi­nan­cial hard­ship.</p>
    <p>Sus­cep­ti­ble peo­ple are fall­ing ill more of­ten, which is con­sis­tent with the diathe­sis-stress model of ill­ness, he added.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to the Amer­i­can Psy­cho­log­i­cal As­so­ci­a­tion, an ill­ness can de­velop from a ge­netic or bi­o­log­i­cal dis­po­si­tion for that ill­ness (diathe­sis), com­bined with stress­ful con­di­tions.</p>
    <p>To ad­dress such is­sues in Sin­ga­pore, a Na­tional Care hot­line was set up in April. It has re­ceived more than 23,000 calls since then.</p>
    <p>And last month, the Sa­mar­i­tans of Sin­ga­pore (SOS) started an SOS Care Text ser­vice, bring­ing for­ward the launch from Oc­to­ber.</p>
    <p>The ser­vice, avail­able around the clock from Mon­days to Fri­days ex­cept public hol­i­days, has re­ceived about 300 text mes­sages since then.</p>
    <p>SOS chief ex­ec­u­tive Gasper Tan said the ma­jor­ity of clients are be­tween 10 and 29 years old. Not all is­sues raised re­late to the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>COP­ING MECH­A­NISM</p>
    <p>In the West, health ex­perts are con­cerned about the re­port­edly in­creased con­sump­tion of al­co­hol and drugs to cope with the stress of the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Dr Chee said: “Il­licit drug abuse may ac­tu­ally go down due to less ac­cess from re­duced travel and bor­der traf­fic, but we may need to look for in­creased al­co­hol and pre­scrip­tion drug abuse.”</p>
    <p>To deal with the anx­i­etypro­vok­ing un­cer­tainty of the pan­demic, it helps to fo­cus on the present while you look to the fu­ture, ad­vise men­tal-health ex­perts.</p>
    <p>The In­sti­tute for Dis­as­ter Men­tal Health at the State Univer­sity of New York at New Paltz said in an ad­vi­sory peo­ple should find things they en­joy and ap­pre­ci­ate every day, rather than wait­ing for hap­pi­ness at the end of the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Dr Goh stressed that peo­ple should seek help now if they need it, in­stead of wait­ing. “Help can come in many forms, start­ing with talk­ing to loved ones about your strug­gle and an­chor­ing your­self with self-care mea­sures.</p>
    <p>“Look­ing at the sec­ond and third waves of in­fec­tion hap­pen­ing else­where, there is a pos­si­bil­ity we are in the eye of a storm that is yet to blow over. At this stage, it is im­por­tant to take stock and stay vig­i­lant.”</p>
    <p>As the sit­u­a­tion can change, peo­ple need to be flex­i­ble and re­spond to changes, he added.</p>
    <p>Another use­ful tip is to take things one step at a time.</p>
    <p>The Men­tal Health Amer­ica’s ad­vice for cop­ing with dis­as­ter: “For peo­ple un­der stress, an or­di­nary work­load can some­times seem un­bear­able. Pick one ur­gent task and work on it. Once you ac­com­plish that task, choose the next one.</p>
    <p>“Check­ing off tasks will give you a sense of ac­com­plish­ment and make things feel less over­whelm­ing.”</p>
    <p>Peo­ple can also do some­thing pos­i­tive such as do­nat­ing blood or help­ing oth­ers, which can give them a sense of pur­pose in a sit­u­a­tion that feels out of con­trol, it said.</p>
    <p>SOS’ Mr Tan said: “Be­ing mind­ful of one’s men­tal state al­lows us to check in with our­selves reg­u­larly dur­ing this dif­fi­cult pe­riod and to seek sup­port early be­fore our emo­tions be­come desta­bil­is­ing and over­whelm­ing.</p>
    <p>“Loved ones should check in reg­u­larly with those around them and show gen­uine con­cern with­out judg­ment. The ef­fects of the pan­demic may af­fect dif­fer­ent groups of peo­ple dis­pro­por­tion­ally.”</p>
    <p>On when to seek help, Dr Chee said: “If you are hav­ing sig­nif­i­cant anx­i­ety or dis­tress for at least two weeks, if it is con­sis­tently af­fect­ing your sleep, and es­pe­cially if you start feel­ing a sense of hope­less­ness and help­less­ness, it’s time to seek help.”</p>
