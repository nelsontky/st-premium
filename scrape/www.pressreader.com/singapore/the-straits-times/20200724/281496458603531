    <p>WEN­CHANG (China) • China suc­cess­fully launched an un­manned probe to Mars yes­ter­day in its first in­de­pen­dent mis­sion to an­other planet, a bid for global lead­er­ship in space and a dis­play of its tech­no­log­i­cal prow­ess and am­bi­tion.</p>
    <p>Its l argest car­rier rocket, the Long March 5 Y-4, blasted off with the probe at 12.41 pm lo­cal time from the Wen­chang Space Launch Cen­tre on the south­ern is­land of Hainan.</p>
    <p>The probe is named Tian­wen-1, mean­ing “Ques­tions to Heaven”, the name of a poem writ­ten two mil­len­nia ago about the cos­mos.</p>
    <p>It will ar­rive in the Red Planet’s or­bit in Fe­bru­ary next year af­ter a seven-month voy­age over 55 mil­lion km, and will de­ploy the rover to Mars three months later.</p>
    <p>If suc­cess­ful, China will be­come the first coun­try to or­bit, land and de­ploy a rover in its in­au­gu­ral mis­sion.</p>
    <p>There will be chal­lenges ahead as the craft nears Mars, mis­sion spokesman Liu Tongjie told re­porters ahead of the launch.</p>
    <p>“When ar­riv­ing in the vicin­ity of Mars, it is very crit­i­cal to de­cel­er­ate. If the de­cel­er­a­tion process is not right, or if flight pre­ci­sion is not suf­fi­cient, the probe would not be cap­tured by Mars,” he said, re­fer­ring to grav­ity on Mars tak­ing the craft down to the sur­face.</p>
    <p>He said the probe would or­bit Mars for about 21/ months and look</p>
    <p>2 for an op­por­tu­nity to en­ter its at­mos­phere and make a soft land­ing.</p>
    <p>“En­ter­ing, de­cel­er­a­tion and land­ing ( EDL) is a very dif­fi­cult (process). We be­lieve China’s EDL process can still be suc­cess­ful, and the space­craft can land safely,” he said.</p>
    <p>Mr Liu said both the Tian­wen or­biter and rover will re­lay Mars data back to Earth, in­clud­ing on its mor­phol­ogy and ge­o­log­i­cal struc­ture, wa­ter ice dis­tri­bu­tion, cli­mate in­for­ma­tion, and in­ter­nal struc­ture.</p>
    <p>The United Arab Emi­rates launched a probe on Mon­day that will or­bit Mars once it reaches the Red Planet. But the race to watch is be­tween the United States and China, which has worked fu­ri­ously to try and match Wash­ing­ton’s supremacy in space.</p>
    <p>Nasa, the Amer­i­can space agency, has al­ready sent four rovers to Mars since the late 1990s. The next one, Per­se­ver­ance, is an SUV-size ve­hi­cle that will look for signs of an­cient mi­cro­bial life, and gather rock and soil sam­ples with the goal of bring­ing them back to Earth on an­other mis­sion in 2031.</p>
    <p>“As a first try for China, I don’t expect it to do any­thing sig­nif­i­cant be­yond what the US has al­ready done,” said as­tronomer Jonathan McDow­ell at the Har­vard-Smith­so­nian Cen­tre for Astro­physics. Tian­wen-1 is “broadly com­pa­ra­ble to Vik­ing in its scope and am­bi­tion”, he said, re­fer­ring to Nasa’s land­ing mis­sions in 1975-1976.</p>
    <p>Af­ter watch­ing the US and the Soviet Union lead the way dur­ing the Cold War, China has poured bil­lions of dol­lars into its mil­i­tary-led space pro­gramme.</p>
    <p>“China join­ing (the Mars race) will change the sit­u­a­tion dom­i­nated by the US for half a cen­tury,” said an­a­lyst Chen Lan at GoTaiko­nauts, which spe­cialises in China’s space pro­gramme.</p>
    <p>China has made huge strides in the past decade, send­ing a hu­man into space in 2003.</p>
    <p>The Asian pow­er­house has laid the ground­work to as­sem­ble a space sta­tion by 2022 and gain a per­ma­nent foothold in Earth or­bit.</p>
    <p>China has al­ready sent two rovers to the Moon. With the sec­ond, China be­came the first coun­try to make a suc­cess­ful soft land­ing on the far side. The Moon mis­sions gave China ex­pe­ri­ence in op­er­at­ing space­craft be­yond Earth’s or­bit, but Mars is an­other story.</p>
    <p>The much greater dis­tance means “a big­ger light travel time, so you have to do things more slowly as the ra­dio sig­nal round trip time is large”, said Mr McDow­ell.</p>
    <p>It also means “you need a more sen­si­tive ground sta­tion on Earth be­cause the sig­nals will be much fainter”, he added, not­ing that there is a greater risk of fail­ure.</p>
