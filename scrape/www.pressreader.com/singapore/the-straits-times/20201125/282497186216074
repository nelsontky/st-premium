    <p>JU­R­GEN KLOPP LIVER­POOL MAN­AGER, em­ploy­ing a mu­sic anal­ogy to de­scribe his team.</p>
    <p>LON­DON • Ju­r­gen Klopp has con­firmed that Mo­hamed Salah will be avail­able for the Cham­pi­ons League home tie against Ata­lanta today af­ter re­turn­ing a neg­a­tive coro­n­avirus test, while the Liver­pool man­ager also re­mained coy about his lengthy in­jury list.</p>
    <p>Salah missed the 3-0 Premier League win over Le­ices­ter on Sun­day af­ter test­ing pos­i­tive for Covid-19 while on in­ter­na­tional duty with Egypt.</p>
    <p>But Klopp said yes­ter­day that the for­ward, who was pic­tured in train­ing at the club’s new AXA Train­ing Cen­tre on Mon­day, had recorded a neg­a­tive test fol­low­ing the vic­tory over the Foxes.</p>
    <p>“Mo trained yes­ter­day and looked re­ally good, a neg­a­tive test like the rest,” said Klopp at his pre­match press con­fer­ence.</p>
    <p>“All the tests were neg­a­tive so he’s avail­able if noth­ing changes. We have to see what we can do with that.”</p>
    <p>With Vir­gil van Dijk and Joe Gomez side­lined with long-term in­juries, and the likes of Jor­dan Hen­der­son, Trent Alexan­der-Arnold, Thi­ago Al­can­tara, Xher­dan Shaqiri, Naby Keita and Alex Oxlade-Cham­ber­lain also out, the Reds boss was also asked if any more play­ers will be able to fea­ture.</p>
    <p>He said: “All the rest, no news. I don’t want to speak too much</p>
    <p>A DIF­FER­ENT GAME</p>
    <p>We were ex­cep­tional (in Italy). We did ev­ery­thing right. It all came to­gether. But we know that game has noth­ing to do with tomorrow. They’re a top team with a spe­cial way to play. I ex­pect prob­lems in this game.</p>
    <p>about it.”</p>
    <p>Liver­pool are top of Group D with three wins out of three, while Ata­lanta are third, tied on four points with Ajax. Midtjyl­land are bot­tom with three de­feats so far.</p>
    <p>A win today will see Klopp’s men through to the knock­out stages.</p>
    <p>The Reds thrashed Ata­lanta 5-0 ear­lier this month, thanks to a hat­trick from Diogo Jota, but Klopp has warned his play­ers not to un­der­es­ti­mate the Ital­ian side.</p>
    <p>“They are a threat (even) with­out a point to prove,” the Ger­man said.</p>
    <p>“We were ex­cep­tional (in Italy). We did ev­ery­thing right. It all came</p>
    <p>to­gether. But we know that game has noth­ing to do with tomorrow. They’re a top team with a spe­cial way to play. I ex­pect prob­lems in this game.”</p>
    <p>The 53-year-old also of­fered his back­ing to Roberto Firmino, ad­mit­ting that he was “re­ally emo­tional” when the for­ward scored just his sec­ond goal of the sea­son in the win over Le­ices­ter.</p>
    <p>The Brazil­ian has been un­der fire in re­cent weeks due to his lack of goals and the good start made by sum­mer sign­ing Jota.</p>
    <p>His 41 suc­cess­ful passes out of 48, and six shots against Le­ices­ter were the most he has man­aged in</p>
    <p>any Premier League game this cam­paign, and that has im­pressed his man­ager.</p>
    <p>“Scor­ing was al­ways im­por­tant for Bobby but he is a com­plete foot­baller,” Klopp said.</p>
    <p>“Foot­ball is like an orches­tra and if you have dif­fer­ent peo­ple for in­stru­ments, some of them are louder but all are im­por­tant for the rhythm. Bobby can play with­out (goals) as well.”</p>
    <p>Liver­pool have yet to con­cede a goal in this sea­son’s Cham­pi­ons League and could keep four clean sheets in a row in the com­pe­ti­tion for the first time since March 2009.</p>
    <p>Ata­lanta coach Gian Piero Gasperini be­lieves it would be a tough task to even score a goal today but has urged his play­ers to go all out for the win.</p>
    <p>He said: “Hon­estly, beat­ing them would be a great sat­is­fac­tion. I saw Liver­pool against Le­ices­ter and they are prob­a­bly liv­ing their best mo­ment (of the sea­son).</p>
    <p>“Do­ing a good re­sult at An­field would be very i mpor­tant and would give us great sat­is­fac­tion.”</p>
