    <p>I bought this bougainvil­lea plant about two years ago and it had pink, yel­low and white flow­ers. Then it stopped flow­er­ing. Now, only pink flow­ers are seen. How do I bring out the other colours of the blooms? Also, what caused the yel­low spots on the leaves? The plant gets about six hours of af­ter­noon sun ev­ery day.</p>
    <p>S. Ku­mar</p>
    <p>Bougainvil­lea plants with mul­ti­coloured bracts around the flow­ers are of­ten sold as grafted spec­i­mens. Stems from dif­fer­ent coloured cul­ti­vars are grafted onto a com­mon root stock.</p>
    <p>With this in mind, it is im­por­tant to not prune such stems that are at­tached to the root stock. If this is done, you may lose por­tions that pro­duce cer­tain flo­ral colours.</p>
    <p>As for the yel­low spots, if these occur dur­ing the rainy sea­son, they could be due to a fun­gal dis­ease. You may want to re­move in­fected leaves to pre­vent the spread of the dis­ease.</p>
    <p>Also, en­sure your plant is grown in an area with suf­fi­cient air cir­cu­la­tion and sun­light. The leaves should be dry. Avoid soil splashes. You may re­duce the in­ci­dence of dis­ease by pro­vid­ing plants with a clear shel­ter to keep out the rain as well as by spray­ing a pre­ven­tive fungi­cide.</p>
    <p>This plant in my gar­den was not grown by any­one. It grows quite fast and its leaves are also quite large. What plant is it and is it a flow­er­ing species?</p>
    <p>Michael Fong</p>
    <p>The plant you have is likely a Sch­ef­flera species. The most com­mon species that looks like the one you have is the Sch­ef­flera actino­phylla.</p>
    <p>It grows i nto a large, multi­branched tree and its com­mon names in­clude Um­brella Tree and Oc­to­pus Tree.</p>
    <p>Smaller spec­i­mens of the plant make good fo­liage can­di­dates in large con­tain­ers.</p>
    <p>It is also grown in out­door land­scapes and ad­mired for its fo­liage and growth habit.</p>
    <p>In ma­ture spec­i­mens, plants pro­duce a branched i nflo­res­cence that looks like the ten­ta­cles of an oc­to­pus.</p>
