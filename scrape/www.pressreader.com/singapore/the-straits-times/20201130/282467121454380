    <p>• Ed­die Jones praised Eng­land for avoid­ing more “hor­ror movie drama” on Welsh soil fol­low­ing a 24-13 Au­tumn Na­tions Cup rugby win over Wales last Satur­day.</p>
    <p>Vic­tory meant Eng­land booked a place in Sunday’s Na­tions Cup fi­nal against France, who beat Italy 36-5 at Twick­en­ham.</p>
    <p>The Six Na­tions cham­pi­ons did not have things all their own way, how­ever, and were only 11-7 ahead come half-time at Parc Y Scar­lets.</p>
    <p>But Mako Vu­nipola’s sec­ond­half try, al­lied to Eng­land cap­tain Owen Far­rell’s kick­ing, saw them to vic­tory af­ter Wales led through Johnny Wil­liams’ con­verted try.</p>
    <p>That meant there was no re­peat of last year’s Six Na­tions clash in Cardiff, where Eng­land led 10-3 at the break only for Wales to run out 21-13 win­ners.</p>
    <p>“At half-time it could have been a ‘Psy­cho’ hor­ror movie,” Eng­land coach Jones told re­porters as he com­pared his team’s po­si­tion to one of the most no­to­ri­ous mur­der scenes in movie his­tory.</p>
    <p>“It was the ex­act same situation as the game in the Mil­len­nium Sta­dium where we did most of the play in the first, were slightly ahead. Wales did a few things at the end of the first half to put us off our game and then we had a choice at half­time of how we would re­act. Would we al­low them to con­tinue or do we stick to our game? The boys showed re­ally good tac­ti­cal dis­ci­pline to stick to our game.”</p>
    <p>Eng­land’s win was built on scrum and line-out dom­i­nance, with the for­mer Aus­tralia and Ja­pan coach con­ced­ing their at­tack­ing play could be im­proved.</p>
    <p>Eng­land now have a chance to gain revenge for their 24-17 loss to Les Bleus in Fe­bru­ary and they can do so in front of 2,000 fans.</p>
    <p>Sup­port­ers are set to be back at Twick­en­ham for the first time since the coro­n­avirus pan­demic in March and Jones be­lieves his play­ers will lift their game. “We want to make sure we put on a per­for­mance that lights up peo­ple’s eyes when they sit there,” he said.</p>
