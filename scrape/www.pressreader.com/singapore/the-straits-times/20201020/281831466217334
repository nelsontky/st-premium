    <p>In­done­sia and the United States have agreed to boost de­fence and se­cu­rity co­op­er­a­tion, af­ter a meet­ing be­tween In­done­sian De­fence Min­is­ter Prabowo Su­bianto and US De­fence Sec­re­tary Mark Esper in Wash­ing­ton.</p>
    <p>The top de­fence of­fi­cials dis­cussed “re­gional se­cu­rity, bi­lat­eral de­fence pri­or­i­ties and de­fence ac­qui­si­tions” in their meet­ing last Fri­day, ac­cord­ing to a joint state­ment by In­done­sia’s De­fence Min­istry and the US Depart­ment of De­fence on the same day.</p>
    <p>They ex­pressed their com­mon in­ten­tion “to en­hance bi­lat­eral mil­i­tary-to-mil­i­tary ac­tiv­i­ties and work to­gether on mar­itime se­cu­rity”.</p>
    <p>“Sec­re­tary Esper com­mu­ni­cated the im­por­tance of up­hold­ing hu­man rights, the rule of law and pro­fes­sion­al­i­sa­tion as the two coun­tries ex­pand their en­gage­ment. Min­is­ter Su­bianto ex­pressed the im­por­tance of mil­i­tary en­gage­ment at all lev­els and com­mu­ni­cated his ap­pre­ci­a­tion for the United States’ sup­port for In­done­sia’s de­fence moderni­sa­tion,” the state­ment said.</p>
    <p>But it did not elab­o­rate on what kind of sup­port Mr Prabowo had re­ferred to. There has been no of­fi­cial an­nounce­ment about any deal sealed dur­ing his five-day visit which ended yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>In­done­sia’s De­fence Min­istry is try­ing to mod­ernise its weapon sys­tems, and has shown in­ter­est in some US-made ones. Mr Prabowo had ear­lier met his coun­ter­parts from China, Rus­sia and other key arms sup­pli­ers – all US ad­ver­saries – and dis­cussed In­done­sia’s cur­rent needs in de­fence, while also touch­ing on some re­gional af­fairs.</p>
    <p>The US was ex­pected to re­new warn­ings to Jakarta against ma­jor arms pur­chases from Moscow, and ex­perts warned that pur­chas­ing Rus­sian fighter jets could lead to US sanc­tions un­der the US Coun­ter­ing Amer­ica’s Ad­ver­saries Through Sanc­tions Act, Reuters re­ported.</p>
    <p>Mr Prabowo’s visit also came at a time when Wash­ing­ton is set­ting its sights on South-east Asian part­ners to con­tain the greater in­flu­ence of China in the Indo-Pa­cific re­gion.</p>
    <p>Among the fu­ture co­op­er­a­tion be­tween the US and In­done­sia is the restart­ing of work to re­cover the re­mains of US per­son­nel lost in In­done­sia dur­ing World War II, un­der a mem­o­ran­dum of in­tent signed by Mr Prabowo and Dr Esper, the state­ment said.</p>
    <p>“Both lead­ers ex­pressed sym­pa­thies to those af­fected by Covid-19 in the United States and In­done­sia,” it added.</p>
    <p>The US has handed over ven­ti­la­tors and US$12.3 mil­lion (S$16.7 mil­lion) in Covid-19 re­lief fund­ing to In­done­sia, the world’s fourth-most pop­u­lous na­tion with nearly 270 mil­lion people, where 365,240 have been in­fected and 12,617 killed by the coro­n­avirus.</p>
    <p>Mr Prabowo, a former spe­cial forces com­man­der, was pre­vi­ously banned from en­ter­ing the US for two decades due to his al­leged role in past hu­man rights vi­o­la­tions, in­clud­ing the 1998 ri­ots af­ter the fall of In­done­sian president Suharto. Con­cerns over hu­man rights abuses had also ended the co­op­er­a­tion be­tween the In­done­sian and US mil­i­taries.</p>
    <p>Hu­man rights ad­vo­cates had protested against the US’ move to grant Mr Prabowo a visa. In a joint let­ter to Sec­re­tary of State Mike Pom­peo dated Oct 13, Amnesty In­ter­na­tional and other groups had said the de­ci­sion to lift the travel ban is an “abrupt, com­plete re­ver­sal of long­stand­ing US for­eign pol­icy which has been in place for 20 years”.</p>
