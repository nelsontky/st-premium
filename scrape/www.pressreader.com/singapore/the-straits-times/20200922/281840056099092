    <p>When the re­sults of India’s biggest en­gi­neer­ing en­trance ex­ams came out last week, eight of the top 24 scor­ers were from the south­ern state of Te­lan­gana, the most for any re­gion.</p>
    <p>But qui­eter cel­e­bra­tions marked a more his­toric achieve­ment: An un­prece­dented 709 stu­dents from tribal and poor com­mu­ni­ties in Te­lan­gana passed the exam.</p>
    <p>They are first-gen­er­a­tion learn­ers – chil­dren of farm labour­ers, do­mes­tic work­ers, driv­ers, se­cu­rity guards and road­side tea sell­ers. Last year, about 500 passed the exam.</p>
    <p>When Naini Ma­matha, 17, called her par­ents from her hos­tel to say she had scored in the 89.11 per­centile, her mother, who had never gone to school, cried for a few min­utes. She blessed her, and then went back to work in the farms in her for­est vil­lage in Mancherial dis­trict in Te­lan­gana.</p>
    <p>A mem­ber of the Korwa community, recog­nised by the gov­ern­ment as a par­tic­u­larly vul­ner­a­ble tribal group, Ma­matha is the first in her fam­ily to go to school and will now be the first in her vil­lage to pur­sue an en­gi­neer­ing de­gree.</p>
    <p>Ev­ery year, tens of thou­sands of In­dian high school­ers take the Joint En­trance Ex­am­i­na­tions (JEE) for ad­mis­sion to en­gi­neer­ing cour­ses in 1,650 gov­ern­ment-run col­leges. This year, to com­pete for about 39,000 places, over 635,000 stu­dents took the JEE, held in Jan­uary and this month, in the mid­dle of the Covid-19 pan­demic.</p>
    <p>The JEE is a pre­req­ui­site for the JEE Ad­vanced, which fur­ther sifts can­di­dates for a mere 11,000 places in 23 In­dian In­sti­tutes of Tech­nol­ogy (IITs), premier en­gi­neer­ing col­leges whose grad­u­ates of­ten se­cure the high­est-pay­ing jobs.</p>
    <p>“I want to be an IITian, and do com­puter sci­ence en­gi­neer­ing,” Ma­matha said, list­ing her tick­ets out of poverty.</p>
    <p>Can­di­dates who can af­ford to of­ten pre­pare for the three-hour mul­ti­ple-choice en­trance test from the age of 14 – when they are in 10th grade – in or­der to take the test af­ter the 12th grade.</p>
    <p>They spend at least half a mil­lion ru­pees (S$9,200) a year on coach­ing and do sam­ple tests ev­ery day for two years. As a re­sult, en­gi­neer­ing col­leges are dom­i­nated by up­per-caste and high- and-mid­dle in­come stu­dents.</p>
    <p>Dr R.S. Praveen Ku­mar, 53, sec­re­tary of the Te­lan­gana So­cial Wel­fare Res­i­den­tial Ed­u­ca­tional In­sti­tu­tions So­ci­ety, said: “The poor­est of the poor are not ex­posed to this world and even if they are, they can’t af­ford coach­ing.”</p>
    <p>A po­lice of­fi­cer from a poor fam­ily him­self, Dr Ku­mar con­vinced the Te­lan­gana gov­ern­ment to en­hance its 158 state-run res­i­den­tial tribal and so­cial wel­fare schools in 2013.</p>
    <p>The schools, in ru­ral and ur­ban ar­eas, now of­fer about 30,000 places a year, and have com­mit­ted sci­ence and English teach­ers, com­puter labs, sports, mu­sic and cul­tural ac­tiv­i­ties. Selected stu­dents get fo­cused coach­ing, free of charge, to sit com­pet­i­tive pro­fes­sional ex­ams like the JEE.</p>
    <p>“When we arm them with in­for­ma­tion, self-con­fi­dence and sup­port, tribal and poor chil­dren lose their feel­ings of in­fe­ri­or­ity and dream big,” Dr Ku­mar added.</p>
    <p>Ma­matha left her school-run hos­tel for home dur­ing the Covid-19 lock­down, but with­out a smart­phone and In­ter­net, she could not at­tend on­line classes.</p>
    <p>Her school prin­ci­pal, Mrs. P. Arunas­ree, rushed her back to the hos­tel 15 days be­fore the exam to re­sume coach­ing. Mrs Arunas­ree said: “If she did not have all these hard­ships, Ma­matha would have scored more than 90.”</p>
    <p>Re­call­ing PhD stu­dent Ro­hith Vem­ula who hanged him­self in 2016 be­cause he felt marginalis­ed at the Univer­sity of Hy­der­abad, Dr Ku­mar said the so­cial wel­fare schools run an “ac­cli­ma­ti­sa­tion” course be­fore their stu­dents en­ter pres­ti­gious uni­ver­si­ties, to help them cope with any cul­ture shock. They also have a helpline.</p>
    <p>Such sup­port net­works were a big help to Malothu Lachi­ram­naik, 19, a third-year civil en­gi­neer­ing stu­dent at IIT Hy­der­abad whose par­ents are paddy farm­ers</p>
    <p>“I used to be ner­vous ini­tially, but af­ter three years, my spo­ken English is bet­ter, I’ve got good friends, I do lots of sports, dance and fun col­lege things. You know, any­one who gets real op­por­tu­ni­ties can have all this,” he said.</p>
