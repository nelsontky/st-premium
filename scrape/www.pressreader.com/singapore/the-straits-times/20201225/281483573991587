    <p>TIGHT­EN­ING OF CON­TROL</p>
    <p>BEI­JING • China kicked off an in­ves­ti­ga­tion into al­leged mo­nop­o­lis­tic prac­tices at Alibaba Group Hold­ing and sum­moned af­fil­i­ate Ant Group to a high-level meet­ing over fi­nan­cial reg­u­la­tions, es­ca­lat­ing scru­tiny over the twin pil­lars of bil­lion­aire Jack Ma’s In­ter­net em­pire.</p>
    <p>The State Ad­min­is­tra­tion for Mar­ket Reg­u­la­tion is in­ves­ti­gat­ing Alibaba, the top an­titrust watch­dog said in a state­ment yes­ter­day with­out fur­ther de­tails.</p>
    <p>Reg­u­la­tors in­clud­ing the cen­tral bank and bank­ing watch­dog will sep­a­rately sum­mon af­fil­i­ate Ant to a meet­ing in­tended to drive home in­creas­ingly strin­gent fi­nan­cial reg­u­la­tions, which now pose a threat to the growth of the world’s big­gest on­line fi­nan­cial ser­vices firm.</p>
    <p>Ant said in a state­ment on its of­fi­cial WeChat ac­count that it will study and com­ply with all re­quire­ments.</p>
    <p>Once hailed as driv­ers of eco­nomic pros­per­ity and sym­bols of the coun­try’s tech­no­log­i­cal prow­ess, Alibaba and ri­vals like Ten­cent Hold­ings face in­creas­ing pres­sure from reg­u­la­tors af­ter amass­ing hun­dreds of mil­lions of users and gain­ing in­flu­ence over al­most ev­ery as­pect of daily life in China.</p>
    <p>Alibaba’s Hong Kong stock slid by as much as 7.7 per cent to a five­month in­tra­day trough, while Ten­cent and In­ter­net ser­vices gi­ant Meituan de­clined more than 1 per cent. Shares in SoftBank Group, Alibaba’s largest share­holder, erased gains to trade as much as 2.7 per cent lower in Tokyo.</p>
    <p>In­vestors are di­vided over the ex­tent to which Bei­jing will go af­ter Alibaba – Asia’s largest cor­po­ra­tion af­ter Ten­cent – and its com­pa­tri­ots as Chi­nese Pres­i­dent Xi Jin­ping’s gov­ern­ment pre­pares to roll out a raft of anti-mo­nop­oly reg­u­la­tions.</p>
    <p>The coun­try’s lead­ers have said lit­tle about how harshly they plan to clamp down or why they de­cided to act now.</p>
    <p>Draft rules re­leased last month give the gov­ern­ment un­usu­ally wide lat­i­tude to rein in tech en­trepreneur­s like Mr Ma, who un­til re­cently en­joyed an un­usual amount of free­dom to ex­pand their em­pires.</p>
    <p>“It’s clearly an es­ca­la­tion of co­or­di­nated ef­forts to rein in Jack Ma’s em­pire, which sym­bol­ised China’s new ‘too-big-to-fail’ en­ti­ties,” said Zhong­guan­cun In­ter­net Fi­nance In­sti­tute re­searcher Dong Ximiao. “The Chi­nese au­thor­i­ties want to see a smaller, less dom­i­nant and more com­pli­ant firm.”</p>
    <p>The flam­boy­ant Alibaba co­founder has all but van­ished from pub­lic view since Ant’s ini­tial pub­lic of­fer­ing (IPO) was de­railed.</p>
    <p>As of early this month, with his em­pire un­der reg­u­la­tory scru­tiny, the man most closely iden­ti­fied with the me­te­oric rise of China Inc was ad­vised by the gov­ern­ment to stay in the coun­try, a source has said. Alibaba rep­re­sen­ta­tives were not im­me­di­ately avail­able for com­ment.</p>
    <p>The coun­try’s In­ter­net ecosys­tem – long pro­tected from com­pe­ti­tion by the likes of Google and Face­book – is dom­i­nated by two com­pa­nies, Alibaba and Ten­cent, through a labyrinthi­ne net­work of in­vest­ment that en­com­passes the vast ma­jor­ity of the coun­try’s start-ups in are­nas from ar­ti­fi­cial in­tel­li­gence to dig­i­tal fi­nance.</p>
    <p>Their pa­tron­age has also groomed a gen­er­a­tion of ti­tans, in­clud­ing food and travel gi­ant Meituan and Didi Chux­ing – China’s Uber. Those that pros­per out­side their aura, the largest be­ing TikTok owner ByteDance, are rare.</p>
    <p>The anti-mo­nop­oly rules now threaten to up­set that sta­tus quo with a range of po­ten­tial out­comes, from a be­nign sce­nario of fines to a break-up of in­dus­try lead­ers. Bei­jing’s di­verse agen­cies now ap­pear to be co­or­di­nat­ing their ef­forts – a bad sign for the In­ter­net sec­tor.</p>
    <p>The cam­paign against Alibaba and its peers got into high gear last month, af­ter Mr Ma fa­mously at­tacked Chi­nese reg­u­la­tors in a pub­lic ad­dress for lag­ging be­hind the times.</p>
    <p>Mar­ket over­seers sub­se­quently sus­pended Ant’s IPO – the world’s largest at US$35 bil­lion (S$46.5 bil­lion) – while the anti-mo­nop­oly watch­dog threw mar­kets into a tail­spin shortly af­ter with its draft leg­is­la­tion.</p>
    <p>The chances that Ant will be able to re­vive its mas­sive stock list­ing next year are look­ing in­creas­ingly slim as China over­hauls rules gov­ern­ing the fin­tech in­dus­try.</p>
    <p>China is said to have sep­a­rately set up a joint task force to over­see Ant, led by the Fi­nan­cial Sta­bil­ity and De­vel­op­ment Com­mit­tee, a fi­nan­cial sys­tem reg­u­la­tor.</p>
    <p>“China has stream­lined a lot of the bu­reau­cracy, so it’s eas­ier for the dif­fer­ent reg­u­la­tory bodies to work to­gether now,” said Mr Mark Tan­ner, manag­ing di­rec­tor of Shang­hai-based con­sul­tancy China Skinny.</p>
    <p>“Of all the reg­u­la­tory hur­dles, this is the big­gest by a long shot.”</p>
    <p>It’s clearly an es­ca­la­tion of co­or­di­nated ef­forts to rein in Jack Ma’s em­pire, which sym­bol­ised China’s new ‘too-big-to-fail’ en­ti­ties.</p>
