    <p>Just about 400 tourists re­main in the cen­tral Viet­nam city of Danang, of­fi­cials told The Straits Times yes­ter­day, af­ter tens of thou­sands of tourists evac­u­ated the city ahead of a 15-day long lock­down to com­bat a re­newed coron­avirus out­break.</p>
    <p>Viet­nam is on high alert, with 12 new in­fec­tions con­firmed yes­ter­day across the coun­try and the au­thor­i­ties rac­ing to ring-fence the threat posed by re­turnees.</p>
    <p>While would-be trav­ellers rushed to can­cel their hol­i­day book­ings, a pizza par­lour in Hanoi was dis­in­fected and a ho­tel in Ho Chi Minh City was locked down, lo­cal me­dia re­ported.</p>
    <p>The new in­fec­tions logged yes­ter­day were in Danang, Hanoi, Ho Chi Minh City and Dak Lak prov­ince in the cen­tral high­lands.</p>
    <p>Prime Min­is­ter Nguyen Xuan Phuc said the cur­rent wave of in­fec­tions was dif­fer­ent from the pre­vi­ous wave Viet­nam fought in March, and ev­ery prov­ince and city in the coun­try was at risk, state broad­caster Viet­nam Tele­vi­sion re­ported.</p>
    <p>The source of this lat­est out­break re­mains un­clear as Viet­nam has largely banned en­try to for­eign­ers since March and has quar­an­tined all ar­rivals. Prior to last Satur­day, the coun­try had not seen any lo­cal trans­mis­sion in over three months.</p>
    <p>While the law en­force­ment au­thor­i­ties have stepped up in­spec­tions and un­cov­ered dozens of il­le­gal en­trants from China over the past month, none of them have tested pos­i­tive for Covid-19 so far.</p>
    <p>The health au­thor­i­ties had ear­lier at­trib­uted the new in­fec­tions to a more con­ta­gious strain of the coron­avirus not de­tected in Viet­nam be­fore.</p>
    <p>The coun­try of 97 mil­lion was among the first in South-east Asia to restart busi­nesses and in­ter-pro­vin­cial travel af­ter a na­tion­wide stay-home or­der.</p>
    <p>In May, it launched a l ocal tourism cam­paign to stim­u­late the econ­omy, with ho­tels and air­lines of­fer­ing deep dis­counts to get peo­ple back on the road.</p>
    <p>As a re­sult, there were an es­ti­mated 80,000 tourists i n the coastal city of Danang when lo­cal trans­mis­sion was de­tected at the week­end.</p>
    <p>Mr Nguyen Xuan Binh, deputy di­rec­tor of Danang’s de­part­ment of tourism, told The Straits Times yes­ter­day morn­ing that about 400 tourists re­main stranded in the city.</p>
    <p>At least six ho­tels have of­fered dis­counted rates to help them tide over the 15-day lock­down now in ef­fect in Danang, where non-es­sen­tial travel is pro­hib­ited.</p>
    <p>“The rooms have to be in­spected by the de­part­ment of health to see if they meet so­cial dis­tanc­ing reg­u­la­tions,” Mr Binh said.</p>
    <p>“We are try­ing our best to help tourists to re­turn home as soon as pos­si­ble. We are still work­ing with other of­fices and re­lated depart­ments to of­fer more help.”</p>
    <p>All flights and bus and train ser­vices to and from Danang were suspended from Tues­day, and res­i­dents have been or­dered to stay home un­less head­ing out for es­sen­tial work or er­rands.</p>
    <p>Since the start of the coron­avirus pan­demic, Viet­nam has recorded 450 cases. None of the pa­tients has died.</p>

Apart from the cap&#xAD;i&#xAD;tal, Viet&#xAD;nam&#x2019;s new in&#xAD;fec&#xAD;tions are in Danang, Ho Chi Minh City and Dak Lak prov&#xAD;ince in the cen&#xAD;tral high&#xAD;lands.</p>
