    <p>The Chi­nese author­i­ties de­layed re­new­ing the press cre­den­tials of some jour­nal­ists work­ing for Amer­i­can me­dia out­lets, in­clud­ing Bloomberg News, CNN and the Wall Street Jour­nal, in re­sponse to the Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion lim­it­ing visa terms for Chi­nese re­porters in the United States.</p>
    <p>The for­eign jour­nal­ists in Bei­jing were told their res­i­dence per­mits will at this stage be ex­tended un­til Nov 6, which ap­pears to co­in­cide with the date when the 90-day visas given to the Chi­nese press in the US will need to be re­newed.</p>
    <p>Two non-Amer­i­cans at Bloomberg News re­ceived a let­ter al­low­ing them to work and stay in the coun­try in lieu of hav­ing of­fi­cial press cre­den­tials, which in the past were nor­mally good for 12 months.</p>
    <p>A Bloomberg spokesman de­clined to com­ment.</p>
    <p>The For­eign Cor­re­spon­dents’ Club of China called on Bei­jing to re­verse the move.</p>
    <p>“These co­er­cive prac­tices have again turned ac­cred­ited for­eign jour­nal­ists in China into pawns in a wider diplo­matic con­flict,” the group said in a state­ment yes­ter­day. “(The club) calls on the Chi­nese gov­ern­ment to halt this cy­cle of tit-for-tat reprisals in what is quickly be­com­ing the dark­est year yet for me­dia free­doms.”</p>
    <p>The dis­pute is one of sev­eral fric­tion points in an in­creas­ingly broad clash be­tween the two coun­tries. While China’s news or­gan­i­sa­tions are over­whelm­ingly state-run and sub­ject to strict cen­sor­ship over­seen by the rul­ing Com­mu­nist Party, Amer­i­can pri­vate news or­gan­i­sa­tions em­pha­sise scru­tiny of gov­ern­ment ac­tions.</p>
    <p>The US has tra­di­tion­ally granted more visas to Chi­nese me­dia out­lets, while China more tightly con­trols the en­trance of for­eign jour­nal­ists. The Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion has sought greater par­ity be­tween the two sides, what it calls “rec­i­proc­ity”.</p>
    <p>Chi­nese For­eign Min­istry spokesman Hua Chun­y­ing said yes­ter­day that visa ex­ten­sion ap­pli­ca­tions for the jour­nal­ists were be­ing pro­cessed and that “they can con­tinue to live and work here with no prob­lems at all”.</p>
    <p>“We would be glad to con­tinue our ex­cel­lent co­op­er­a­tion with the #US jour­nal­ists here if the Chi­nese jour­nal­ists are treated fairly in the US,” Ms Hua said on Twit­ter.</p>
    <p>At the Chi­nese For­eign Min­istry’s reg­u­lar news brief­ing yes­ter­day af­ter­noon, an­other spokesman, Mr Zhao Li­jian, ac­cused the US of “kid­nap­ping” jour­nal­ists and tak­ing “hostages” in the dis­pute.</p>
    <p>“For China, all op­tions are on the ta­ble,” he said, not­ing that the US had also re­fused to rule out any ac­tions.</p>
    <p>“If the US truly cares about Amer­i­can jour­nal­ists in China, it should ex­tend the visas for all Chi­nese jour­nal­ists as soon as pos­si­ble in­stead of kid­nap­ping Chi­nese and Amer­i­can jour­nal­ists out of self­ish po­lit­i­cal pur­poses,” Mr Zhao said.</p>
    <p>Bei­jing has said the US has ex­pelled more than 60 Chi­nese me­dia per­son­nel and de­nied visas to more than 20 oth­ers.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, the For­eign Cor­re­spon­dents’ Club of China said the Chi­nese gov­ern­ment had forced a record 17 for­eign cor­re­spon­dents to leave in the first half of this year and put at least a dozen more on visas that are as short as one month.</p>
