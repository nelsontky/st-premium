    <p>Elec­tric­ity tar­iffs col­lected by na­tional power grid op­er­a­tor SP Group do not go to its prof­its, but to the power gen­er­a­tion com­pa­nies which have in­curred higher pro­duc­tion costs given the in­crease in global fuel prices, Sec­ond Min­is­ter for Trade and In­dus­try Tan See Leng told Par­lia­ment yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>He said the power gen­er­a­tion firms need to see re­turns from the sig­nif­i­cant in­vest­ments in in­fra­struc­ture they have made. He was re­spond­ing to a call by Non-Con­stituency MP Leong Mun Wai for SP Group to de­lay the hike in elec­tric­ity tar­iffs in this down­turn.</p>
    <p>The Progress Sin­ga­pore Party NCMP had cited the 9.3 per cent elec­tric­ity tar­iff hike for the final quar­ter of this year, say­ing it was an ex­am­ple of a fee hike that erased the ef­fect of the Gov­ern­ment’s sup­port mea­sures. “Here is a power-grid mo­nop­o­list which does not gen­er­ate elec­tric­ity, but made bil­lions of dol­lars since the lib­er­al­i­sa­tion of the elec­tric­ity mar­ket in 2012, spar­ing no time in rais­ing prices at the first avail­able op­por­tu­nity, even as Sin­ga­pore­ans strug­gle un­der the Covid-19 cri­sis,” he said. SP Group could have eas­ily ab­sorbed the in­creased costs with its past prof­its, in­stead of pass­ing them on to con­sumers, he added.</p>
    <p>In re­sponse, Dr Tan said that SP Group buys elec­tric­ity from the power gen­er­a­tion com­pa­nies at the full cost of pro­duc­ing and de­liv­er­ing it to con­sumers, and em­pha­sised that it “does not ben­e­fit from the in­crease in tar­iffs di­rectly”. The re­cent tar­iff in­crease is pri­mar­ily due to the rise in fuel cost, he added. Be­tween July and Septem­ber this year, the price of crude oil rose by 47 per cent, and this in­creased the costs in­curred by the power gen­er­a­tion com­pa­nies, said Dr Tan.</p>
    <p>“The ad­di­tional amount of elec­tric­ity tar­iffs that SP can col­lect or col­lected from the con­sumers in Q4 of 2020 will then be passed on to these power gen­er­a­tion com­pa­nies to off­set their fuel cost in­creases,” he said, adding that fuel costs con­sti­tute be­tween a third and half of to­tal costs for power gen­er­a­tion com­pa­nies.</p>
    <p>Dr Tan added that house­holds get “very, very tar­geted sup­port for their util­ity bills”, such as the $100 Sol­i­dar­ity Util­i­ties Credit and the goods and ser­vices tax voucher U-Save spe­cial pay­ments. Res­i­dents in one- to two-room HDB flats get be­tween six and eight months of help with util­ity bills; those in three- to four-room flats get be­tween four and six months of help.</p>
    <p>Senior Min­is­ter of State for Trans­port and For­eign Af­fairs Chee Hong Tat also rose to ex­plain that SP Group, as the power grid op­er­a­tor, pro­vides the trans­mis­sion and dis­tri­bu­tion sys­tem con­nect­ing the power gen­er­a­tion com­pa­nies to con­sumers. Mr Chee, who was for­merly senior min­is­ter of state for trade and in­dus­try and also pre­vi­ously the chief ex­ec­u­tive of the En­ergy Mar­ket Author­ity, drew a dis­tinc­tion be­tween the price of elec­tric­ity here and SP Group’s earn­ings.</p>
    <p>“It’s im­por­tant for us to be clear what is the busi­ness model of the var­i­ous en­ti­ties be­fore we make com­ments like why are they mak­ing so much profit and not pass­ing through some of these to con­sumers,” he said.</p>
    <p>“Mr Leong needs to un­der­stand what the facts are so that we can have a mean­ing­ful dis­cus­sion based on ac­cu­rate facts.”</p>
