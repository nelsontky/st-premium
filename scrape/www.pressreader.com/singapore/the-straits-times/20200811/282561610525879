    <p>MUM­BAI • Bol­ly­wood ac­tors and crew aged over 65 will be al­lowed to re­sume shoots, an in­dus­try of­fi­cial said last Fri­day, af­ter an In­dian court over­turned coro­n­avirus re­stric­tions lim­it­ing the pres­ence of older peo­ple on film sets.</p>
    <p>The world’s most pro­lific film in­dus­try has been strug­gling to get back on its feet af­ter strict rules ban­ning elab­o­rate scenes and bar­ring se­nior ac­tors from shoots were un­veiled in June.</p>
    <p>But last Fri­day’s de­ci­sion by a court in Mum­bai has paved the way for ac­tors over the age of 65 to re­turn to work, al­low­ing some of In­dia’s most revered stars, such as 77-year-old Amitabh Bachchan, to re­sume film­ing.</p>
    <p>“All artists, direc­tors, pro­duc­ers, tech­ni­cians over the age of 65 years who were barred from en­ter­ing the sets pre­vi­ously will be al­lowed to re­sume work without any dis­rup­tion,” said In­dian Mo­tion Pic­tures Pro­duc­ers’ As­so­ci­a­tion (Imppa) sec­re­tary Anil Na­grath.</p>
    <p>Imppa had pe­ti­tioned the Bom­bay High Court to strike down the ban, ar­gu­ing it was ageist and un­fair.</p>
    <p>The rul­ing came just days af­ter Bachchan was dis­charged from Mum­bai’s Nana­vati Hospi­tal, fol­low­ing a coro­n­avirus di­ag­no­sis that saw him spend three weeks in the med­i­cal fa­cil­ity.</p>
    <p>His ac­tor son Ab­hishek – who is still in hospi­tal – and ac­tress daugh­ter-in-law Aish­warya Rai, as well as grand­daugh­ter Aarad­hya, were all di­ag­nosed with the virus, un­der­scor­ing the scale of the pan­demic’s spread in In­dia, where cases crossed two mil­lion last Fri­day.</p>
    <p>The gov­ern­ment of Ma­ha­rash­tra state, home to Bol­ly­wood, has sought to limit in­fec­tions by ban­ning pro­duc­ers from film­ing com­plex dance num­bers and fight se­quences – which are sta­ples of pop­u­lar Hindi cin­ema.</p>
    <p>So­cial-dis­tanc­ing norms will also put a stop to scenes show­ing ac­tors kiss­ing or em­brac­ing, spell­ing a re­turn to the more con­ser­va­tive 1980s when Bol­ly­wood songs of­ten cut to images of flow­ers brush­ing against each other – then short­hand for ro­mance.</p>
    <p>In ad­di­tion to pro­vid­ing crew mem­bers with med­i­cal and life in­sur­ance, pro­duc­ers will be re­quired to have a doc­tor, nurse and an am­bu­lance on set – a pun­ish­ing re­quire­ment at a time when Mum­bai is al­ready strug­gling with a short­age of health work­ers and am­bu­lances.</p>
