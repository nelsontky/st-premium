    <p>•</p>
    <p>WASHINGTON The United States could be the first coun­try to launch one of the most am­bi­tious vac­cine op­er­a­tions in his­tory: dis­tribut­ing and ad­min­is­ter­ing up to 600 mil­lion doses of a Covid-19 vac­cine in just a few months.</p>
    <p>Mas­sive vac­cine cam­paigns are noth­ing new. But stamp­ing out the coro­n­avirus is a dis­tinctly new chal­lenge due to three fac­tors: the short time­frame for in­oc­u­lat­ing a huge num­ber of peo­ple, the fact that most vac­cines will re­quire two doses and the very low tem­per­a­ture at which some of the vac­cines must be stored.</p>
    <p>The vac­cine de­vel­oped by US phar­ma­ceu­ti­cal gi­ant Pfizer and Ger­many’s BioNTech, on track to be the first au­tho­rised for use in the US, must be stored at mi­nus 70 deg C, while the flu vac­cine can be kept in a nor­mal re­frig­er­a­tor.</p>
    <p>Pfizer vac­cines dis­trib­uted in the US will come from its largest man­u­fac­tur­ing plant i n Kala­ma­zoo, Michi­gan, and their ship-out will in­clude a pre­cise, clock­work dance of con­tain­ers, trucks and planes.</p>
    <p>Ther­mal ship­ping con­tain­ers will each be filled with dry ice and 975 vials of the vac­cine, which each con­tain five doses, for a to­tal of 4,875 doses. Ev­ery day, six trucks will take the doses to air car­ri­ers, such as FedEx, UPS and DHL, which will de­liver them across the coun­try in one to two days and across the globe in three, Pfizer said.</p>
    <p>The firm ex­pects an av­er­age of 20 daily cargo flights world­wide.</p>
    <p>FedEx had to ob­tain spe­cial per­mis­sion from civil avi­a­tion au­thor­i­ties to trans­port so much dry ice, which could pose a dan­ger to the crew should it ac­ci­den­tally un­dergo “sub­li­ma­tion” and pass from a solid to a gas, it said.</p>
    <p>Once the boxes reach their fi­nal des­ti­na­tion, they can be opened briefly just two times a day.</p>
    <p>“To run a large mass vac­ci­na­tion clinic, it’s fine,” said Dr Julie Swann, a pan­demic re­sponse ex­pert at North Carolina State Uni­ver­sity. But the vac­cine would not be suit­able for dis­tri­bu­tion at doc­tors’ of­fices or phar­ma­cies, which are too small, she warned.</p>
    <p>At least in the be­gin­ning, Amer­i­cans will have to go to hos­pi­tals or maybe even large dis­tri­bu­tion cen­tres set up in parking lots much like Covid-19 test sites, she said. The vac­cines can re­main in their boxes for two weeks, mean­ing hos­pi­tals will not need a spe­cial freezer.</p>
    <p>“We’re not rec­om­mend­ing at this time that hos­pi­tals or clin­ics pur­chase ul­tra-cold equip­ment,” said Dr Janell Routh of the Cen­tres for Dis­ease Con­trol and Preven­tion.</p>
    <p>US biotech gi­ant Moderna is also man­u­fac­tur­ing a vac­cine – which can be stored at mi­nus 20 deg C, the tem­per­a­ture of a nor­mal freezer.</p>
    <p>The US gov­ern­ment is or­gan­is­ing a free dis­tri­bu­tion of this vac­cine to US states and ter­ri­to­ries, with each ju­ris­dic­tion to de­cide how to dis­trib­ute the doses.</p>
    <p>“The fed­eral gov­ern­ment does not in­tend, with very, very few ex­cep­tions, to touch a sin­gle dose of vac­cine be­fore it goes into the arm of Amer­i­cans,” said Oper­a­tion Warp Speed of­fi­cial Paul Mango.</p>
    <p>The ob­jec­tive is to of­fer vac­cines to the most vul­ner­a­ble pop­u­la­tions be­fore the end of next month, to health­care work­ers be­fore the end of Jan­uary, and to all Amer­i­cans by the be­gin­ning of April.</p>
    <p>Pfizer ex­pects to pro­duce 50 mil­lion doses this year and 1.3 bil­lion next year.</p>
    <p>The US has al­ready or­dered 100 mil­lion in to­tal, in­clud­ing 20 mil­lion to 30 mil­lion for de­liv­ery be­fore the end of next month. The Euro­pean Union has or­dered 200 mil­lion, Ja­pan 120 mil­lion, Bri­tain 30 mil­lion and Canada 20 mil­lion.</p>
    <p>DHL es­ti­mates that 15 mil­lion cool­ing boxes would need to be de­liv­ered over the next two years, with ap­prox­i­mately 15,000 flights needed world­wide.</p>
    <p>Poorer coun­tries which l ack stor­age ca­pac­ity for large quan­ti­ties of vac­cines that need su­per­cold stor­age have lit­tle hope of ben­e­fit­ing from the first doses, said Dr Prashant Ya­dav, an ex­pert in global health sup­ply chains at the Cen­tre for Global De­vel­op­ment. Ul­tra-cold freez­ers that can reach tem­per­a­tures of mi­nus 80 deg C cost five times more than stan­dard freez­ers and are made to or­der only, he added.</p>
    <p>The US re­ported a record 201,214 daily Covid-19 cases on Tues­day, data from Johns Hop­kins Uni­ver­sity showed, tak­ing the tally to more than 10.2 mil­lion cases. The coun­try has reg­is­tered more than 239,000 deaths from the dis­ease.</p>
    <p>Over the past 10 days, about one mil­lion new coro­n­avirus in­fec­tions have been reg­is­tered in the US, the fastest pace since it re­ported its first case in Jan­uary.</p>
