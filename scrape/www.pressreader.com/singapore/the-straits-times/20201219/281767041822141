    <p>WASH­ING­TON/BEI­JING • The US De­fence Depart­ment will soon start so­lic­it­ing pro­pos­als for a pro­gramme to pro­vide in­cen­tives to boost semi­con­duc­tor man­u­fac­tur­ing ca­pa­bil­i­ties i n the United States, ac­cord­ing to a post­ing on a govern­ment con­tract­ing site.</p>
    <p>Ma­jor Amer­i­can semi­con­duc­tor firms such as Ap­ple, Qual­comm and Nvidia rely on out­side man­u­fac­tur­ers such as Tai­wan Semi­con­duc­tor Man­u­fac­tur­ing (TSMC) or Sam­sung Elec­tron­ics to fab­ri­cate their chips in what are called foundries.</p>
    <p>Most of those foundries are lo­cated in Tai­wan and South Korea. While In­tel op­er­ates US chip fac­to­ries, they are mostly ded­i­cated to man­u­fac­tur­ing its own chips rather than do­ing work for ex­ter­nal clients.</p>
    <p>The De­fence Depart­ment is look­ing to change that dy­namic by pro­vid­ing in­cen­tives for the de­vel­op­ment of chip-re­lated in­tel­lec­tual prop­erty and the cre­ation of ad­vanced foundries in the US, ac­cord­ing to a no­tice posted on the web­site of the Na­tional Se­cu­rity Tech­nol­ogy Ac­cel­er­a­tor, a non-profit group that works to con­nect pri­vate-sec­tor com­pa­nies with govern­ment con­tract op­por­tu­ni­ties.</p>
    <p>The depart­ment plans to an­nounce a pro­gramme called “Rapid As­sured Mi­cro­elec­tron­ics Pro­to­types-Com­mer­cial”, or RAMP-C, that will com­ple­ment ex­ist­ing pro­grammes it re­cently launched to en­cour­age US chip man­u­fac­tur­ing.</p>
    <p>In Oc­to­ber, one of In­tel’s plants in Ari­zona won the sec­ond phase of a con­tract aimed at help­ing the US mil­i­tary de­velop ad­vanced chips more quickly. TSMC, a ma­jor sup­plier to Ap­ple, is also in­de­pen­dently work­ing to build a US$12 bil­lion (S$16 bil­lion) chip plant in Ari­zona.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, the US Com­merce Depart­ment was ex­pected to add around 80 more firms and af­fil­i­ates – nearly all of them Chi­nese and in­clud­ing China’s top chip­maker SMIC – to a trade black­list yes­ter­day, said two peo­ple fa­mil­iar with the mat­ter.</p>
    <p>The move is seen as the lat­est in Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump’s ef­fort to ce­ment his tough-on-China legacy, be­fore Pres­i­dent-elect Joe Bi­den takes of­fice on Jan 20.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, China’s For­eign Min­istry said that if true, the black­list­ing would be ev­i­dence of US op­pres­sion of Chi­nese firms and that Bei­jing would con­tinue to take nec­es­sary mea­sures to pro­tect their rights. “We urge the US to cease its mis­taken be­hav­iour of un­war­ranted op­pres­sion of for­eign com­pa­nies,” min­istry spokesman Wang Wen­bin told a reg­u­lar news con­fer­ence in Bei­jing.</p>
    <p>The des­ig­na­tions by the Com­merce Depart­ment are ex­pected to name some Chi­nese firms that Wash­ing­ton says have ties to the Chi­nese mil­i­tary, in­clud­ing some which are help­ing it con­struct and mil­i­tarise ar­ti­fi­cial is­lands in the South China Sea, the sources said.</p>
