    <p>CAIRO • Egyp­tian mother of three Menna said she was caught off guard when a bull­dozer clear­ing space for a con­tro­ver­sial high­way flat­tened much of a mau­soleum that dou­bled as her home in a sprawl­ing ceme­tery.</p>
    <p>“The earth mover sud­denly hit the wall and we found our­selves throw­ing our things in a panic” out­side, she told Agence FrancePres­se. Sur­rounded by rub­ble and dust in the Unesco-listed world her­itage site, she added: “They kicked us out on the street.”</p>
    <p>Ms Menna’s par­ents and grand­par­ents had made their home among the graves of the City of the Dead, the old­est necrop­o­lis in the Mus­lim world.</p>
    <p>For the thou­sands un­able to af­ford pro­hib­i­tively high rents in Egypt’s cap­i­tal, the burial cham­bers pro­vide shel­ter. Many built ex­ten­sions to the orig­i­nal mau­soleums, ek­ing out a largely tran­quil, if bizarre, ex­is­tence side by side with dead sul­tans, singers and saints in the sprawl­ing ceme­tery.</p>
    <p>Ms Menna has sought refuge with neigh­bours in a part of the ceme­tery that is not in the de­mo­li­tion area.</p>
    <p>Dozens of bod­ies were dis­placed by con­struc­tion work in the sec­ond half of last month, said lo­cal me­dia, to make way for the 17.5km Al-Fer­daous, or Par­adise, high­way. Con­nect­ing ma­jor Cairo road ar­ter­ies, it is the lat­est in­stal­ment of Pres­i­dent Ab­del Fat­tah al-Sisi’s urban vi­sion.</p>
    <p>He aims to trans­fer the cen­tre of po­lit­i­cal power to a new cap­i­tal, about 45km east of Cairo – a mega pro­ject in the desert over­seen by the mil­i­tary’s en­gi­neer­ing arm.</p>
    <p>It is not just res­i­dents of the City of the Dead who are up­set by the de­mo­li­tion work un­der­taken there.</p>
    <p>Ms Galila El Kadi, a Mar­seille­based veteran ar­chi­tect and urban re­searcher, said the site is “an im­por­tant com­po­nent” of the cap­i­tal’s urban his­tory.</p>
    <p>A fi­nal rest­ing place for il­lus­tri­ous fig­ures and or­di­nary Egyp­tians, the Is­lamic necrop­o­lis founded in the 7th cen­tury stretches over 6.5km. It is full of or­nately de­signed domes with chis­elled Qu­ranic verses that have been the ob­ject of fas­ci­na­tion for ori­en­tal­ist painters and his­to­ri­ans.</p>
    <p>Ms Kadi, who au­thored a book on the City of the Dead, said the de­mo­li­tion had reached a his­toric perime­ter where lu­mi­nar­ies are buried, in­clud­ing Sul­tan Abu Sa’id Qan­suh of the Mam­luk dy­nasty in the 15th cen­tury. She said the de­mo­li­tions would re­sult in a loss of Cairo’s “vis­ual iden­tity and its mem­ory”.</p>
    <p>They re­veal the “blind and ar­bi­trary” char­ac­ter of a hap­haz­ard urban plan­ning vi­sion, driven by a “bull­dozer pol­icy”, Ms Kadi al­leged.</p>
    <p>Unesco told AFP that it was “nei­ther i nformed nor con­sulted” about the de­mo­li­tion work un­der­taken last month. It added: “The World Her­itage Cen­tre is fol­low­ing up with the Egyp­tian au­thor­i­ties to re­view the mat­ter and as­sess any po­ten­tial im­pacts on the out­stand­ing uni­ver­sal value, au­then­tic­ity and in­tegrity of the prop­erty.”</p>
    <p>Egypt’s Min­istry of An­tiq­ui­ties has de­fended the work un­der­taken in the ceme­tery last month and said “there was no de­struc­tion of mon­u­ments”. Only “re­cent graves” were moved, it said.</p>
    <p>IN A PANIC</p>
    <p>The earth mover sud­denly hit the wall and we found our­selves throw­ing our things in a panic. ’’</p>
