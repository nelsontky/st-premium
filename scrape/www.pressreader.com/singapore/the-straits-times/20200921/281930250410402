    <p>Hav­ing failed to com­plete a huge wall along the south­ern bor­der of the United States, Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump’s ad­min­is­tra­tion now seems des­per­ate to build one in cy­berspace for sim­i­lar spu­ri­ous rea­sons.</p>
    <p>Whereas the bo­gey­man four years ago was a sup­posed in­flux of drugs and crim­i­nals from Mex­ico, the US an­nounced last Fri­day that Ten­cent Hold­ings’ in­stant mes­sag­ing app WeChat will es­sen­tially be shut down in</p>
    <p>Amer­ica from this week be­cause of some vague no­tion that it poses an im­me­di­ate threat.</p>
    <p>In an­nounc­ing the move, which also in­cludes a ban on ByteDance’s TikTok to go in ef­fect from Nov 12 un­less it re­solves its pend­ing is­sues, Com­merce Sec­re­tary Wil­bur Ross made it sound as if there was in­con­tro­vert­ible ev­i­dence of their ne­far­i­ous na­ture.</p>
    <p>There’s no doubt that Bei­jing, its gov­ern­ing Com­mu­nist Party and the na­tion’s mil­i­tary and in­tel­li­gence ser­vices have waged sus­tained cy­ber of­fen­sives against the US and dozens of other coun­tries.</p>
    <p>This year alone, two Chi­nese hackers were ac­cused of at­tempt­ing to pil­fer coro­n­avirus re­search across 11 coun­tries, while more than 100 tar­gets are thought to be among vic­tims in a so­phis­ti­cated in­fil­tra­tion scheme out­lined by the US last week. But the ev­i­dence against WeChat is lack­ing.</p>
    <p>The app of­fers ser­vices that are roughly akin to an amal­gam of Face­book, Venmo, In­sta­gram, Twit­ter and Post­mates. Its core fea­ture is mes­sag­ing, sim­i­lar to What­sApp. And yes, it col­lects data. Reams of it. As does Face­book, Al­pha­bet’s Google, Mi­crosoft and even Or­a­cle.</p>
    <p>In the US, WeChat is largely used by the Chi­nese di­as­pora. And it’s quite prob­a­ble that a small seg­ment of those users op­pose the US, its demo­cratic sys­tem of gov­ern­ment and maybe even com­mu­ni­cate their plans over chat.</p>
    <p>In truth, an even big­ger risk to the free­doms for which the US stands is that Chi­nese dis­si­dents in Amer­ica might use the app and Bei­jing most likely tracks them.</p>
    <p>An­other con­cern is that the Com­mu­nist Party’s in­creas­ingly height­ened cen­sor­ship regime is be­ing de­ployed on WeChat at the ex­pense of Amer­i­can cit­i­zens (largely of Chi­nese eth­nic­ity) en­tirely within US bor­ders. And yet, any such ma­nip­u­la­tion or data in­fil­tra­tion pales in sig­nif­i­cance to that al­ready per­pe­trated against en­tirely Amer­i­can in­sti­tu­tions such as Face­book and Twit­ter.</p>
    <p>In­stead of stamp­ing out any threats posed by the Chi­nese gov­ern­ment, which do ex­ist, the US ad­min­is­tra­tion has sim­ply handed Bei­jing an­other item to add to its fo­lio of pro­pa­ganda that paints the US as a bel­liger­ent and hyp­o­crit­i­cal regime.</p>
    <p>Just as Chi­nese of­fi­cials can use ex­am­ples of US po­lice of­fi­cers killing un­armed black men as a counter to Washington’s al­le­ga­tions of hu­man rights abuses in Hong Kong and against Uighurs, they now have this unnecessar­y WeChat ban as proof that the US isn’t an open free­dom-lov­ing na­tion af­ter all.</p>
    <p>The pre­dictable re­ac­tion from Bei­jing will also be hyp­o­crit­i­cal. It’s true that thou­sands of Chi­nese in the US will strug­gle to com­mu­ni­cate di­rectly with friends and fam­ily back home once</p>
    <p>WeChat ac­cess is shut off. But that’s only be­cause more ubiq­ui­tous op­tions in the US – What­sApp, Face­book Mes­sen­ger and Twit­ter – have al­ready been banned by</p>
    <p>China.</p>
    <p>A US move to shut WeChat still pales in com­par­i­son with the Great Fire­wall that Bei­jing has had in place for more than a decade. And that’s why this move will prove to be so des­per­ate and in­ef­fec­tive.</p>
    <p>It won’t stop teams of state-spon­sored hackers from in­fil­trat­ing cor­po­rate and gov­ern­ment net­works, nor pre­vent ma­nip­u­la­tion of Amer­ica’s open In­ter­net and in­de­pen­dent me­dia. But it will pro­vide fod­der for the grow­ing be­lief that the US truly is no bet­ter than any au­thor­i­tar­ian state seek­ing to clamp down on the free flow of in­for­ma­tion in the name of national se­cu­rity.</p>
    <p>Like that bar­rier along the Mex­i­can bor­der, this vir­tual wall against China will have un­told costs and lit­tle ben­e­fit.</p>
