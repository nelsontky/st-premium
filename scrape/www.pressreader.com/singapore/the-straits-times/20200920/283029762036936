    <p>Should you be a land­lord? That’s a ques­tion some mid­dle-class young peo­ple may be ask­ing them­selves lately. As mil­len­ni­als ease into early mid­dle age, those with a bit of money saved up will be look­ing to park it some­where.</p>
    <p>But they should be fully aware of what they’re get­ting them­selves into. Hous­ing, his­tor­i­cally, has been one of the best in­vest­ments avail­able, of­fer­ing re­turns al­most as good as the stock mar­ket: This fi­nan­cial re­turn in­cludes the rent hous­ing earns.</p>
    <p>Of course, peo­ple who live in owner-oc­cu­pied hous­ing also earn the full re­turn, be­cause they save money on rent. But own­ing mul­ti­ple ren­tal prop­er­ties can be even more lu­cra­tive.</p>
    <p>Prop­erty is also an easy in­vest­ment for normal peo­ple to un­der­stand. The in­tri­ca­cies of cor­po­rate per­for­mance and the swings of the mar­ket make stocks a for­bid­ding prospect for the av­er­age in­vestor, ex­cept through an in­dex fund or man­aged re­tire­ment plan.</p>
    <p>But prac­ti­cally every­one has lived in a house or apart­ment; most of us un­der­stand the re­quire­ments of main­tain­ing a live­able space. Houses are a tan­gi­ble, sim­ple as­set whose value is read­ily ap­par­ent.</p>
    <p>How­ever, be­ing a land­lord also has its fi­nan­cial down­sides. One of th­ese is risk. Land­lords tend to be highly lever­aged, so fail­ing to suf­fi­ciently fill a ren­tal prop­erty for even a short amount of time can be ru­inous.</p>
    <p>A lo­cal eco­nomic down­turn can crush the value of a prop­erty in­vest­ment. And if a land­lord also has an­other job in the same area where they own ren­tal prop­er­ties, the same eco­nomic down­turn that threat­ens their ren­tal in­come will also ad­versely af­fect their earn­ings. Thus, be­ing a land­lord can re­duce di­ver­si­fi­ca­tion.</p>
    <p>Some peo­ple on the po­lit­i­cal left con­sider be­ing a land­lord im­moral. But there’s noth­ing in­her­ently wrong with own­ing ren­tal prop­er­ties.</p>
    <p>If you refuse to buy and let out a prop­erty, it won’t help push the gov­ern­ment to im­ple­ment a so­cial hous­ing pro­gramme. Nei­ther will it raise the na­tional home own­er­ship rate.</p>
    <p>Some other land­lord or prop­erty man­age­ment com­pany will sim­ply buy the house and let it out in­stead. And most land­lords are far from be­ing lazy bums – main­tain­ing a prop­erty takes work.</p>
    <p>But be­fore de­cid­ing to be­come a land­lord, it’s also worth con­sid­er­ing how such an av­o­ca­tion and in­vest­ment strat­egy might change your life­style. Some of those changes might not be pos­i­tive ones.</p>
    <p>Land­lords and tenants have an asym­met­ric power re­la­tion­ship. Although it’s of­ten dif­fi­cult and la­bo­ri­ous, a land­lord can gen­er­ally evict a ten­ant for not pay­ing rent, as well as for var­i­ous other vi­o­la­tions.</p>
    <p>As so­ci­ol­o­gist Matthew Des­mond vividly de­scribes in his book Evicted: Poverty And Profit In The Amer­i­can City, evic­tion is a trau­matic ex­pe­ri­ence, es­pe­cially for chil­dren. It up­ends peo­ple’s whole lives, and de­prives them of one of the most ba­sic hu­man needs – the need to know that one will have a place to sleep to­mor­row.</p>
    <p>In con­trast, the worst thing a ten­ant can typ­i­cally do to a land­lord is to move out, forc­ing the land­lord to ei­ther find an­other ten­ant quickly or lose money. Tenants don’t have zero bar­gain­ing power with re­spect to land­lords, but there’s re­ally no com­par­i­son be­tween mak­ing some­one lose money and mak­ing them lose the roof over their heads.</p>
    <p>If you choose to be­come a land­lord, there­fore, you might have to deal with a fam­ily that, through no fault of its own, falls on hard times – per­haps be­cause of an un­ex­pected med­i­cal bill or loss of a job.</p>
    <p>At that point you’ll have enor­mous power over other peo­ple’s lives. You’ll have to de­cide whether to let your­self lose money – per­haps so much that you have to sell the prop­erty – or kick an un­for­tu­nate fam­ily onto the street.</p>
    <p>Be­ing a land­lord can also change a per­son’s pol­i­tics. As some­one who makes money both from rent and price ap­pre­ci­a­tion, your in­cen­tive will be to sup­port any poli­cies that raise ei­ther rents or prop­erty val­ues.</p>
    <p>Re­search shows home own­er­ship in­creases po­lit­i­cal par­tic­i­pa­tion, so it’s highly likely own­ing ren­tal prop­er­ties ex­erts a sim­i­lar ef­fect. No mat­ter how much you might ide­al­is­ti­cally be­lieve in mak­ing hous­ing more af­ford­able, as a land­lord you will have to con­stantly strug­gle against your own fi­nan­cial im­per­a­tives.</p>
    <p>Un­like sim­ply putting your money into an in­dex fund, own­ing ren­tal prop­er­ties forces big life­style changes. It’s of­ten a good fi­nan­cial move, but there are clear rea­sons why some peo­ple might shy away from it.</p>
