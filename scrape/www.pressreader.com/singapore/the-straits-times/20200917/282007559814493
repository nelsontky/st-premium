    <p>(Spain) • Colom­bian jour­nal­ist Jineth Be­doya Lima, who was ab­ducted, tor­tured and sex­u­ally as­saulted on her way to in­ter­view an in­fa­mous para­mil­i­tary war­lord i n Bo­gota i n 2000, was awarded the Golden Pen of Free­dom by the World As­so­ci­a­tion of News Pub­lish­ers (Wan-Ifra) yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Ms Be­doya Lima was in­ves­ti­gat­ing re­ports of al­leged arms sales be­tween the paramil­i­taries and state of­fi­cials for her news­pa­per, El Espec­ta­dor, in 2000 when she went to the no­to­ri­ous La Modelo pri­son in Bo­gota, for the in­ter­view.</p>
    <p>Three years later, in 2003, while work­ing for El Tiempo, she was again ab­ducted and held for eight days when she had trav­elled to meet mem­bers of the for­mer Rev­o­lu­tion­ary Armed Forces of Colom­bia, a guer­rilla group that waged war against the Colom­bian state for 52 years. There, she was hu­mil­i­ated and beaten.</p>
    <p>For years she kept her har­row­ing ex­pe­ri­ences to her­self but in 2009, she broke her si­lence when she launched the cam­paign No Es Hora De Cal­lar (It is not time to be silent) to de­fend women’s rights and de­nounce the sys­tem­atic im­punity in cases of sex­ual vi­o­lence in Colom­bia.</p>
    <p>Wan-Ifra said the Golden Pen of Free­dom award recog­nises “Ms Be­doya Lima’s ded­i­ca­tion to the pro­fes­sion of jour­nal­ism, her tire­less work in pro­mot­ing and pro­tect­ing the rights of women, and her courage in con­fronting and over­com­ing her own per­sonal tragedy with a level of dig­nity and de­ter­mi­na­tion that serves as in­spi­ra­tion to peers the world over”.</p>
    <p>“This award is the great­est en­cour­age­ment and sup­port that a jour­nal­ist can re­ceive,” said Ms Be­doya Lima in ac­cept­ing the award.</p>
    <p>She added that the award was also recog­ni­tion of the tire­less fight against im­punity that dozens of jour­nal­ists face around the world.</p>
    <p>In an in­ter­view with the Guardian news­pa­per in 2009, Ms Be­doya Lima said she had kept silent about the events that be­fell her for many years be­cause the gov­ern­ment sim­ply “would not recog­nise these crimes”.</p>
    <p>“No one wanted to look into it, or even talk about it,” she said.</p>
    <p>In a land­mark de­ci­sion in July last year, the In­ter-Amer­i­can Com­mis­sion on Hu­man Rights con­firmed Ms Be­doya Lima as a vic­tim and de­clared the Colom­bian state re­spon­si­ble for the acts com­mit­ted against her nearly two decades before.</p>
    <p>In de­liv­er­ing the award at a vir­tual event, World Edi­tors Fo­rum pres­i­dent War­ren Fer­nan­dez de­scribed Ms Be­doya Lima’s con­vic­tion and courage as a “shin­ing in­spi­ra­tion” at a time when “jour­nal­ists, women and mi­nori­ties are un­der such great threat of vi­o­lence, op­pres­sion, and dis­crim­i­na­tion” around the world.</p>
    <p>He noted that when asked how she sur­vived those dif­fcult times, Ms Be­doya Lima often replied that she “re­fused to be si­lenced, choose to sur­vive, to keep do­ing jour­nal­ism”.</p>
    <p>Mr Fer­nan­dez, who is also ed­i­tor of The Straits Times and ed­i­tor-in­chief of Sin­ga­pore Press Hold­ings’ English/ Malay/ Tamil Me­dia Group, added: “In the dif­fi­cult days ahead, as we con­tinue to grap­ple with Covid-19, we will have to re­build and rein­vig­o­rate our rav­aged news­rooms.</p>
    <p>“We will have to find new ways to sus­tain them and keep them go­ing, ‘to choose to sur­vive, to keep do­ing jour­nal­ism’, in the in­ter­ests of the com­mu­ni­ties we serve.”</p>
