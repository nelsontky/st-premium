    <p>We must re-es­tab­lish our po­si­tion by re­open­ing our bor­ders grad­u­ally, po­si­tion­ing Sin­ga­pore as a safe des­ti­na­tion, lev­el­ling up ca­pa­bil­i­ties and re­fresh­ing our in­fras­truc­ture.</p>
    <p>Dis­rup­tions from Covid-19 may have thrown a span­ner in the works for Sin­ga­pore to be a well-con­nected air hub, but the Gov­ern­ment is dou­bling down on ef­forts to re­store the coun­try’s con­nec­tiv­ity.</p>
    <p>Pledg­ing to re­vive Sin­ga­pore’s sta­tus as an air hub when global travel re­sumes, Deputy Prime Min­is­ter Heng Swee Keat also said in Par­lia­ment yes­ter­day that the Gov­ern­ment will work on build­ing up the coun­try to be a Global-Asia con­flu­ence of tech­nol­ogy, in­no­va­tion and en­ter­prise.</p>
    <p>“We must re-es­tab­lish our po­si­tion by re­open­ing our bor­ders grad­u­ally, po­si­tion­ing Sin­ga­pore as a safe des­ti­na­tion, lev­el­ling up ca­pa­bil­i­ties and re­fresh­ing our in­fras­truc­ture,” he said in a min­is­te­rial state­ment on the coun­try’s progress in com­bat­ing Covid-19.</p>
    <p>Mr Heng, who is also Co­or­di­nat­ing Min­is­ter for Eco­nomic Poli­cies and Fi­nance Min­is­ter, added that Trans­port Min­is­ter Ong Ye Kung will de­liver a min­is­te­rial state­ment on re­viv­ing Sin­ga­pore’s air hub in Par­lia­ment to­day.</p>
    <p>The Deputy Prime Min­is­ter fur­ther said the Gov­ern­ment will has­ten moves to strengthen Sin­ga­pore’s mar­itime po­si­tion by im­prov­ing trans­ship­ment ca­pa­bil­i­ties, ink­ing trade fa­cil­i­ta­tion agree­ments and an­chor­ing key ship­ping routes through the coun­try.</p>
    <p>More will be done in terms of re­gional mar­itime co­op­er­a­tion as well, and he cited the Iskandar Malaysia as well as Batam, Bin­tan and Karimun re­gions for the po­ten­tial they hold. He also said Sin­ga­pore will sig­nif­i­cantly strengthen its trade and lo­gis­tics ecosys­tem and deepen ca­pa­bil­i­ties in its port and air­port.</p>
    <p>Moves to bol­ster the coun­try’s dig­i­tal ca­pa­bil­i­ties are be­ing ac­cel­er­ated, said Mr Heng, not­ing that they will be a “game-changer” for Sin­ga­pore’s con­nec­tiv­ity with its global part­ners. He pointed out that Sin­ga­pore has con­cluded Dig­i­tal Econ­omy Agree­ments with Aus­tralia, Chile and New Zealand, and is hav­ing talks with South Korea.</p>
    <p>At the same time, com­pa­nies in Sin­ga­pore are get­ting help to ex­ploit tech­nol­ogy and have em­barked on more than 27,000 projects to im­prove their pro­duc­tiv­ity and build new ca­pa­bil­i­ties through the Gov­ern­ment’s Pro­duc­tiv­ity So­lu­tions Grant and En­ter­prise De­vel­op­ment Grant schemes, he said.</p>
    <p>One ex­am­ple he cited is the Seong­gong restau­rant group, which man­ages brands like Se­o­rae Korean BBQ. He met its founder last Fri­day, and said the group used dig­i­tal tech­nol­ogy to suc­cess­fully re­vamp its oper­a­tions, so much so that its de­liv­er­ies from on­line or­ders have off­set the losses from its dine-in business.</p>
    <p>“The ex­pe­ri­ence of busi­nesses shows that dig­i­tal­i­sa­tion is a strate­gic ca­pa­bil­ity to un­lock growth, evolve their mod­els to har­ness dig­i­tal pos­si­bil­i­ties, and to in­te­grate pro­cesses such as lo­gis­tics, pay­ment, and mar­ket­ing,” he said.</p>
    <p>Work on transformi­ng com­pa­nies and industries through tech­nol­ogy will con­tinue for all busi­nesses here, and a key gov­ern­ment pri­or­ity now is to take dig­i­tal trans­for­ma­tion to en­ter­prises in the heart­land.</p>
    <p>Senior Min­is­ter of State Sim Ann and Min­is­ter of State Low Yen Ling will an­nounce fur­ther plans for these firms in the com­ing days.</p>
    <p>The Gov­ern­ment will also un­veil a new five-year Re­search, In­no­va­tion and En­ter­prise plan in De­cem­ber to en­hance re­search to sup­port ar­eas of na­tional pri­or­ity.</p>
    <p>These ar­eas in­clude early child­hood de­vel­op­ment, life­long learning and keep­ing se­niors healthy.</p>
    <p>The plan will also ex­pand on ef­forts Sin­ga­pore is un­der­tak­ing to trans­form its man­u­fac­tur­ing, avi­a­tion and mar­itime industries, and deepen its ca­pa­bil­i­ties as a Smart Na­tion and sus­tain­able so­ci­ety.</p>
    <p>“By en­hanc­ing our con­nec­tiv­ity and mak­ing in­no­va­tion per­va­sive, we can bet­ter meet the chal­lenges of a post-Covid world, and cre­ate good jobs and a brighter fu­ture for</p>
    <p>all Sin­ga­pore­ans,” said Mr Heng.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, he said that since 2017, the Fu­ture Econ­omy Coun­cil has been driv­ing the im­ple­men­ta­tion of in­dus­try trans­for­ma­tion maps to re­struc­ture Sin­ga­pore’s econ­omy sec­tor by sec­tor.</p>
    <p>Good progress has been made, he added, cit­ing fig­ures on em­ploy­ment, pro­duc­tiv­ity and in­comes. At the end of last year, Sin­ga­pore’s res­i­dent un­em­ploy­ment rate was at a low 3.2 per cent.</p>
    <p>Be­tween 2016 and last year, the over­all pro­duc­tiv­ity, mea­sured by real value-added per hour worked, rose by what Mr Heng called a cred­itable 2.4 per cent per year. This is an im­prove­ment over the 2.2 per cent growth in the pre­ced­ing three-year pe­riod. Real me­dian in­come for Sin­ga­pore­ans grew by 3.7 per cent per year in the last three years, up from 3.2 per cent in the pre­ced­ing three years.</p>
    <p>In­comes at the 20th per­centile grew by 4.4 per cent per year in the last three years, up from 4 per cent in the pre­ced­ing three years.</p>
    <p>“We are build­ing on our good po­si­tion, and keep­ing up the pace,” said Mr Heng.</p>
    <p>He added that the Gov­ern­ment’s task force to guide the coun­try’s eco­nomic re­cov­ery from Covid-19 will be set­ting up more in­dus­try-led al­liances to de­vise ideas for projects and gen­er­ate jobs for Sin­ga­pore­ans.</p>
    <p>There are cur­rently seven such Al­liances for Ac­tion now, and the Emerg­ing Stronger Task­force is look­ing to launch more in new growth ar­eas such as medtech.</p>
