    <p>Coun­tries have to avoid think­ing about eco­nomic ob­jec­tives as sep­a­rate from social ob­jec­tives, said Se­nior Min­is­ter Thar­man Shanmugara­tnam yesterday.</p>
    <p>“If you are not so­cially sus­tain­able, you are not going to have a com­pet­i­tive econ­omy in the long term,” he said, adding that this is something seen across the world.</p>
    <p>Speak­ing during a virtual di­a­logue at the Sin­ga­pore Tech Fo­rum, Mr Thar­man said a com­pet­i­tive and ef­fi­cient econ­omy can cre­ate a lot more op­por­tu­ni­ties for peo­ple.</p>
    <p>But if left en­tirely to the mar­ket, these op­por­tu­ni­ties be­come more po­larised over time, with those who have an ad­van­tage stay­ing ahead and those who start off with less end­ing up with less, he noted.</p>
    <p>“But if you think of an econ­omy as a social ecosys­tem – not just a busi­ness ecosys­tem – you are able to cre­ate op­por­tu­ni­ties, start­ing up­stream in ed­u­ca­tion, but mov­ing into work, be­cause work is still fun­da­men­tal to any sense of equal­ity of op­por­tu­nity,” he said.</p>
    <p>This will help cre­ate a so­ci­ety where all feel they and their chil­dren are more likely to do well if the econ­omy is do­ing well, said Mr Thar­man, also the Co­or­di­nat­ing</p>
    <p>Min­is­ter for Social Poli­cies.</p>
    <p>Con­versely, in a so­ci­ety that lacks co­he­sion and has di­vi­sions widen­ing over time, it is very hard to sus­tain an eco­nomic strat­egy that in­volves be­ing open, find­ing the most ef­fi­cient ways of do­ing things, and be­ing able to grow.</p>
    <p>Mr Thar­man noted that Sin­ga­pore is one of the few ad­vanced coun­tries to have man­aged to sus­tain the mid­dle ma­jor­ity of its so­ci­ety mov­ing up over the decades.</p>
    <p>It has man­aged to up­lift those lower down the lad­der not just by tax and trans­fer, but also by im­prov­ing jobs, he added.</p>
    <p>“There is still sig­nif­i­cant work to be done, sig­nif­i­cant col­lab­o­ra­tion to up­skill peo­ple and help them to take op­por­tu­ni­ties and move up. It will make us a bet­ter so­ci­ety. We are not at all done.”</p>
    <p>Asked by mod­er­a­tor Koh Shiyan from ven­ture cap­i­tal firm Hus­tle Fund on his views about cul­ture and social re­silience re­quired, Mr Thar­man said a sense of “to­geth­er­ness” among peo­ple is needed.</p>
    <p>That is dif­fer­ent from con­form­ity, dif­fer­ent from just same­ness,” he noted.</p>
    <p>“We need a sense of to­geth­er­ness, but at the same time... we need a greater sense of in­di­vid­u­al­ism in think­ing, in cre­at­ing, in want­ing to do things dif­fer­ently. And that is not a con­tra­dic­tion.”</p>
    <p>Un­like the old model of a cer­tain con­form­ity and mov­ing to­gether that East Asia was known for some time ago, the new model is about de­vel­op­ing a streak of want­ing to be dif­fer­ent, but at the same time re­tain­ing a sense of to­geth­er­ness in so­ci­ety, he said.</p>
    <p>“And I think we can achieve that... You need to have that sense of in­di­vid­u­al­ism in think­ing, with­out be­ing so­cially in­di­vid­u­al­is­tic, or where you try to el­bow other peo­ple out.”</p>
    <p>Mr Marc Be­nioff, who is the chair, chief ex­ec­u­tive and founder of tech firm Sales­force, also par­tic­i­pated in the di­a­logue.</p>
    <p>He said Sin­ga­pore is a safe haven for com­pa­nies around the world to do busi­ness due to its good gov­er­nance, cit­ing the coun­try’s re­sponse to Covid-19.</p>
    <p>Un­like many places in the world, Sin­ga­pore has man­aged the pandemic’s spread well while keep­ing its workers safe, he added.</p>
    <p>During a re­cent visit to Sin­ga­pore, Mr Be­nioff said his em­ploy­ees told him they felt quite safe, and he felt free to meet cus­tomers and con­duct busi­ness.</p>
    <p>“I can work while I was there, wow, that is very im­por­tant. A func­tional gov­ern­ment that can op­er­ate and keep the econ­omy going during a cri­sis,” he said.</p>
    <p>The Sin­ga­pore Tech Fo­rum is a global in­dus­try and net­work­ing event.</p>
    <p>Now in its third year run­ning, it is or­gan­ised by the Sin­ga­pore Global Network, a di­vi­sion of the Eco­nomic Devel­op­ment Board, and the Gov­ern­ment Tech­nol­ogy Agency.</p>
    <p>DIF­FER­ENT BUT TO­GETHER</p>
    <p>We need a sense of to­geth­er­ness, but at the same time... we need a greater sense of in­di­vid­u­al­ism in think­ing, in cre­at­ing, in want­ing to do things dif­fer­ently. And that is not a con­tra­dic­tion.</p>
