    <p>My favourite thing about it is you know what’s really im­por­tant – you just want to look after your fam­ily and you don’t sweat the small stuff. ’’</p>
    <p>AC­TRESS LAU­REN CO­HAN (above, fore­ground), who plays Mag­gie in The Walk­ing Dead, on what to do in a hy­po­thet­i­cal apoca­lypse</p>
    <p>What les­sons can a zom­bie pan­demic of­fer the world to­day?</p>
    <p>One of the cast mem­bers of The Walk­ing Dead (2010 to present), Lau­ren Co­han, says the post-apoc­a­lyp­tic tele­vi­sion hit – about peo­ple strug­gling to sur­vive when a zom­bie virus sweeps the globe – taught her a thing or two about con­fronting this year’s coro­n­avirus out­break and gave her a more hope­ful way of look­ing at it.</p>
    <p>Chat­ting with The Straits Times and other press by video call re­cently, the Bri­tish-Amer­i­can ac­tress – who plays the tough-as­nails sur­vivor Mag­gie – ad­mits she was caught off guard by the Covid-19 sit­u­a­tion like every­one else.</p>
    <p>“You would think I wouldn’t have felt as much anx­i­ety in the begin­ning as it’s been my pre­tend life for 10 years,” quips the star, who left the show in 2018, but re­turns for the fi­nal episode of Sea­son 10, air­ing on Mon­days at 11.30am on Fox (Sing­tel Channel 330, StarHub Channel 505 and stream­ing on Fox+).</p>
    <p>“Like every­body, I bought a lot of canned goods in the begin­ning. Now, I give them all to the home­less shel­ter be­cause I haven’t opened any of them,” says the ac­tress, who also starred in the spy series Whiskey Cav­a­lier (2019).</p>
    <p>But the 38-year-old notes there are many “in­ter­est­ing par­al­lels” be­tween the cri­sis con­fronting the world to­day and the one de­picted on the show, which has been nom­i­nated for 16 Em­mys, win­ning two for its con­vinc­ingly ghoul­ish pros­thetic make-up.</p>
    <p>When one thinks about a hy­po­thet­i­cal apoca­lypse, “you prospec­tively try to imag­ine sce­nar­ios – what’s im­por­tant and what you think that you would do in that sit­u­a­tion – and I’ve found a lot of it is true, at least in the way your per­spec­tive changes”, she says.</p>
    <p>“My favourite thing about it is you know what’s really im­por­tant – you just want to look after your fam­ily and you don’t sweat the small stuff.”</p>
    <p>In the series, the world-al­ter­ing pan­demic helps the sur­vivors ap­pre­ci­ate what is truly essen­tial in life.</p>
    <p>“In The Walk­ing Dead, the se­cret bless­ing is that you have what’s in front of you and you’re not dis­tracted. And as scary and un­known as things have been, there’s some­thing very heal­ing about be­ing forced into just deal­ing with the day.”</p>
    <p>In that way, the show fore­shad­owed many peo­ple’s ex­pe­ri­ence of the Covid-19 pan­demic.</p>
    <p>“This pre­mo­ni­tion sort of did prove true. No­body would wish for this sit­u­a­tion, but I have this switch that helps me find the sil­ver lin­ing. I’m sure a lot of us do.”</p>
    <p>Co­han, who joined the cast in Sea­son 2, left the long-run­ning series last sea­son – re­port­edly be­cause the tele­vi­sion network would not pay her what she was ask­ing, said to be less than the US$1 mil­lion (S$1.3 mil­lion) an episode that co-star Nor­man Ree­dus re­ceives.</p>
    <p>She even­tu­ally ap­peared in six episodes of Sea­son 9, be­fore leav­ing to pur­sue projects such as Whiskey Cav­a­lier, but said she was open to re­turn­ing to The Walk­ing Dead at a later date.</p>
    <p>As she re­vis­its Mag­gie’s story, the char­ac­ter’s out­look on life has been a source of in­spi­ra­tion for Co­han dur­ing th­ese tur­bu­lent times.</p>
    <p>“It’s been good go­ing back into the sea­son with all th­ese thoughts in my mind.</p>
    <p>“I think all the time about this scene in the prison from a pre­vi­ous sea­son, when Mag­gie and her late hus­band Glenn find out that she is preg­nant and I say, ‘I don’t want to be afraid of be­ing alive.’”</p>
    <p>Co­han says when think­ing about the dilemma many face in terms of catching Covid-19, she finds that “go­ing through my mind all the time lately”.</p>
    <p>“It’s, like, you mit­i­gate risk and you are aware and you’re cau­tious, but you still try to be the fullest ver­sion of your­self de­spite your fears.”</p>
    <p>Mak­ing the best of a bad sit­u­a­tion is the ul­ti­mate les­son the series of­fers, she adds.</p>
    <p>“You do what you can. If you didn’t know any dif­fer­ently – which we get the chance to de­pict on the show with the chil­dren who are born into that world – you’d be liv­ing within th­ese con­straints as if they were nor­mal.</p>
    <p>“So that’s what the show has made me think about.”</p>
