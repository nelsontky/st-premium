    <p>The blur­ring of lines be­tween the work­place and home has put pres­sure on many work­ers, a Sun­day Times sur­vey finds</p>
    <p>For the past eight months, an op­er­a­tions man­ager has been mon­i­tor­ing per­for­mance trends and con­duct­ing meet­ings from his din­ing ta­ble, which he shares with his ac­coun­tant wife.</p>
    <p>In be­tween work tasks, the 34-year-old grabs quick meals and looks af­ter his ac­tive two-year-old son while his spouse is en­gaged in video calls. He also logs on close to mid­night to clear work e-mails, some­times work­ing un­til 2am.</p>
    <p>Be­ing out of the of­fice, he feels the need to be more plugged in and finds it hard to switch off when work mes­sages ap­pear on his phone. Cou­pled with that is the need for him to be more in­volved in child­care now that he is al­ways home and avail­able to help.</p>
    <p>“It is ex­haust­ing,” he ad­mit­ted, de­clin­ing to be named. “In the past, at least I could tune out when I left the of­fice.”</p>
    <p>It is a plight that is be­ing played out in count­less other homes.</p>
    <p>The Covid-19 pan­demic, with no end in sight, has forced many to adopt telecom­mut­ing and split team ar­range­ments as the norm.</p>
    <p>Though this set-up is not nec­es­sar­ily stress­ful in it­self, when it is pro­longed, it blurs the lines be­tween the work­place and home, lead­ing to work­ers feel­ing stressed and risk­ing burnout, ob­servers told The Sun­day Times.</p>
    <p>Many, es­pe­cially women, are find­ing that the du­ties of home and of­fice are now en­croach­ing on each other and de­mand­ing their at­ten­tion, of­ten at the same time.</p>
    <p>A Sun­day Times on­line poll of 1,200 re­spon­dents last week found that 71 per cent have felt more stressed since they started work­ing from home. It also found that 77 per cent – or about three in four em­ploy­ees – in such work ar­range­ments are putting in more hours than be­fore.</p>
    <p>Recog­nis­ing that men­tal well-be­ing is a grow­ing con­cern, the Min­istry of Man­power, Na­tional Trades Union Congress (NTUC) and Sin­ga­pore Na­tional Em­ploy­ers Fed­er­a­tion is­sued an ad­vi­sory last Tues­day to en­cour­age em­ploy­ers to ad­dress their work­ers’ men­tal health needs.</p>
    <p>Their rec­om­men­da­tions in­clude or­gan­is­ing talks on the is­sue of men­tal health, train­ing man­agers to spot signs of dis­tress, and of­fer­ing clar­ity on af­ter-hours work com­mu­ni­ca­tion.</p>
    <p>HOME DOUBLES AS OF­FICE BUT MAY BE LESS CON­DUCIVE</p>
    <p>While some work­ers en­joy the greater flex­i­bil­ity of work­ing from home, many feel over­whelmed play­ing mul­ti­ple roles.</p>
    <p>Oth­ers are stressed by in­creased work­loads from de­mand­ing bosses, work­ing in spa­ces that are less con­ducive to pro­duc­tiv­ity and be­ing so­cially iso­lated.</p>
    <p>NTUC as­sis­tant sec­re­tary-gen­eral and labour MP Melvin Yong has come across work­ers, es­pe­cially pro­fes­sion­als, man­agers, ex­ec­u­tives and tech­ni­cians, who have to jug­gle mul­ti­ple re­spon­si­bil­i­ties at home, in­clud­ing car­ing for their chil­dren and el­derly par­ents, while try­ing to re­main pro­duc­tive at work.</p>
    <p>“Many now work in­creas­ingly longer hours as e-mails, calls and What­sApp mes­sages come in out­side of their reg­u­lar work­ing hours,” said Mr Yong, who has re­peat­edly raised the is­sue of work­place burnout in Par­lia­ment. “Some have Zoom work meet­ings in the night, which they never had be­fore Covid-19.”</p>
    <p>Mr Yong’s fel­low NTUC as­sis­tant sec­re­tary-gen­eral and labour MP Desmond Choo, who chairs the Govern­ment Par­lia­men­tary Com­mit­tee for Man­power, said that work has crept into per­sonal spa­ces be­cause of tech­nol­ogy like mes­sag­ing apps and video­con­fer­enc­ing. Th­ese have be­come even more preva­lent with the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>“That means that work doesn’t re­ally end for our work­ers and many feel com­pelled to work non­stop,” he said. Mr Choo, who has met work­ers ex­pe­ri­enc­ing anx­i­ety and de­pres­sion while work­ing from home, said the pan­demic has “re­duced the tra­di­tional sup­port struc­tures to help em­ploy­ees cope with stress, while in­creas­ing the feel­ing of iso­la­tion”.</p>
    <p>In the past, they could un­wind with col­leagues over meals and breaks.</p>
    <p>For many work­ers, their homes are not con­ducive to work­ing.</p>
    <p>Some house­holds may have more than one fam­ily mem­ber do­ing vir­tual calls at the same time, while oth­ers do not even have proper work desks.</p>
    <p>Sit­ting on the bed or sofa to work on the lap­top is not ideal, said Mr Paul Heng, man­ag­ing direc­tor of NeXT Ca­reer Con­sult­ing Group, who has met work­ers com­plain­ing of back­aches and other ail­ments as their homes are not equipped with the right fur­ni­ture for work­ing long hours.</p>
    <p>FEAR OF LOS­ING JOB AMID RE­CES­SION-HIT ECON­OMY</p>
    <p>The stress may be self-in­flicted, as some work­ers may feel the need to live up to the ex­pec­ta­tions of their bosses and fam­ily mem­bers, said Mr Heng.</p>
    <p>“Where do we draw the line be­tween of­fice hours and af­ter? No one has the right an­swer be­cause this is new. Many choose to err on the side of cau­tion, that it is bet­ter to stretch the work­ing hours.”</p>
    <p>This may have been height­ened by the fear work­ers have of los­ing their jobs in the re­ces­sion-hit econ­omy.</p>
    <p>Mr David Leong, man­ag­ing direc­tor of Peo­pleWorld­wide Con­sult­ing, feels, in fact, that the pres­sure from job un­cer­tainty is “greater than the pre­sumed in­crease in work­load”.</p>
    <p>In the past few months, med­i­cal prac­ti­tion­ers have also seen more com­plaints from work­ers of anx­i­ety, in­som­nia and fa­tigue.</p>
    <p>Dr Thomas Lee, con­sul­tant psy­chi­a­trist at the Re­silienz Clinic, said his clinic has han­dled about 10 per cent to 15 per cent more pa­tients seek­ing help for work-re­lated is­sues. Com­mon com­plaints in­clude feel­ing anx­ious, so­cially iso­lated and men­tally ex­hausted.</p>
    <p>Pa­tients with de­pres­sion, anx­i­ety and ob­ses­sive-com­pul­sive dis­or­der may see their con­di­tions worsen, he added.</p>
    <p>Ex­perts said, how­ever, that</p>
    <p>LONGER WORK HOURS</p>
    <p>Many now work in­creas­ingly longer hours as e-mails, calls and What­sApp mes­sages come in out­side of their reg­u­lar work­ing hours... Some have Zoom work meet­ings in the night, which they never had be­fore Covid-19.’’</p>

    <p>ERRING ON SIDE OF CAU­TION</p>
    <p>Where do we draw the line be­tween of­fice hours and af­ter? No one has the right an­swer be­cause this is new. Many choose to err on the side of cau­tion, that it is bet­ter to stretch the work­ing hours.’’</p>
    <p>MR PAUL HENG, man­ag­ing direc­tor of NeXT Ca­reer Con­sult­ing Group, on peo­ple work­ing longer hours.</p>
    <p>while the pan­demic has deep­ened the fault lines, work stress is a peren­nial prob­lem caused by poor bosses, over­work and feel­ings of in­ad­e­quacy, among other things.</p>
    <p>The Govern­ment has taken no­tice, with Prime Min­is­ter Lee Hsien Loong an­nounc­ing last month that an in­ter-agency task force will tackle the men­tal health needs of Sin­ga­pore­ans.</p>
    <p>Se­nior clin­i­cal psy­chol­o­gist Jessie Chua said em­ploy­ers can start by creat­ing an open and ac­cept­ing work cul­ture for work­ers to share their con­cerns.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore Hu­man Re­sources In­sti­tute pres­i­dent Low Peck Kem said that em­ploy­ers may con­sider im­ple­ment­ing work­place poli­cies that value their work­ers’ per­sonal time or of­fer the flex­i­bil­ity to man­age their work­ing hours.</p>
    <p>“When an or­gan­i­sa­tion looks af­ter its em­ploy­ees, it’ll re­flect pos­i­tively on its busi­ness. Hence, pay­ing at­ten­tion to an or­gan­i­sa­tion’s men­tal well­ness is a busi­ness im­per­a­tive, and not just nice to have,” she said.</p>
    <p>Four years ago, when I started univer­sity in France, I took three months to open my bank ac­count.</p>
    <p>This was in part due to my fal­ter­ing French, which made com­mu­ni­ca­tion dif­fi­cult. But it was also be­cause my bank rep­re­sen­ta­tive took days to re­ply.</p>
    <p>She never replied on week­ends – be­cause French law pro­tects her right to ig­nore work e-mails af­ter of­fice hours.</p>
    <p>When I landed on French soil in Au­gust 2016, the El Khomri law – named af­ter the labour min­is­ter at that time – pro­vid­ing French work­ers with the right to dis­con­nect had just been en­acted.</p>
    <p>The law calls on com­pa­nies to reg­u­late the use of elec­tronic de­vices for work and to re­spect their em­ploy­ees’ per­sonal and fam­ily time. There are no pro­vi­sions on how com­pa­nies should pro­vide their em­ploy­ees with the right to dis­con­nect, ex­cept that com­pa­nies with more than 50 em­ploy­ees must de­vise a char­ter for this pur­pose.</p>
    <p>In Sin­ga­pore, the is­sue is be­ing dis­cussed now, at a time when the bound­aries be­tween home and work have blurred as many em­ploy­ees work from home amid the global pan­demic.</p>
    <p>On Oct 14, labour MP Melvin Yong said that a “Right to Dis­con­nect” law would help em­ploy­ees have pro­tected time to rest and recharge. He was speak­ing in Par­lia­ment dur­ing the de­bate on the Govern­ment’s strat­egy to emerge stronger from the Covid-19 pan­demic.</p>
    <p>He also raised the need for work­places to help em­ploy­ees fac­ing burnout. Last week, a tri­par­tite ad­vi­sory on men­tal health was is­sued, spell­ing out guide­lines for em­ploy­ers and re­sources for em­ploy­ees.</p>
    <p>How­ever, even if the right to dis­con­nect is leg­is­lated, it may be harder for younger Sin­ga­pore­ans to un­plug.</p>
    <p>I reg­u­larly see young peo­ple on the MRT typ­ing fu­ri­ously on their lap­tops as they com­mute to and from work. An ac­quain­tance posted a photo of her­self re­ply­ing to work mes­sages while climb­ing the stairs to her barre stu­dio af­ter of­fice hours.</p>
    <p>An­other friend’s col­league brought his work lap­top when they went hik­ing one Satur­day – in case he had to re­ply to e-mails.</p>
    <p>Per­haps it is harder for my gen­er­a­tion, the Zoomers – those born in the late 1990s and early 2000s – to dis­con­nect from work, due to the pro­lif­er­a­tion of work chan­nels in this day and age.</p>
    <p>I am a Zoomer in an­other sense too: I use pop­u­lar video­con­fer­enc­ing soft­ware Zoom – and also Mi­crosoft</p>
    <p>Teams, Google Meet and Alibaba’s DingTalk – to talk to my bosses and in­ter­vie­wees.</p>
    <p>The pro­lif­er­a­tion of th­ese “work-re­lated so­cial me­dia” chan­nels cre­ates pres­sure to main­tain vis­i­bil­ity across all th­ese plat­forms, noted Pro­fes­sor Lim Sun Sun, who is head of hu­man­i­ties, arts and so­cial sciences at the Sin­ga­pore Univer­sity of Tech­nol­ogy and De­sign.</p>
    <p>Set­ting the right ex­pec­ta­tions on how re­spon­sive em­ploy­ees need to be on such plat­forms has to be done from the top.</p>
    <p>Said Prof Lim: “Se­nior and mid­dle man­age­ment need to lead by ex­am­ple. For in­stance, you can send an e-mail on Sun­day but make it clear that you don’t ex­pect an im­me­di­ate re­sponse.”</p>
    <p>While a “Right to Dis­con­nect” Bill has yet to be passed, I know small, in­cre­men­tal steps can be taken in this di­rec­tion.</p>
    <p>My ed­i­tors at The Straits Times some­times as­sign me sto­ries be­fore I start work, but they do add caveats in their e-mails, mak­ing it clear that I need to work on them only when my shift starts.</p>
    <p>For such as­sign­ments, I usu­ally get no­ti­fied over e-mail and not via the news­room’s Google Han­gouts chat func­tion, which is more in­tru­sive.</p>
    <p>But per­haps the will­ing­ness to dis­con­nect must also come from within. As a break­ing news re­porter, I do ad­mit that when I see a mes­sage or push no­ti­fi­ca­tion for work, my first in­stinct is to snap into ac­tion.</p>
    <p>Over time, I have learnt to dis­tin­guish be­tween sto­ries for im­me­di­ate re­port­ing and those which I have been tasked with in ad­vance, be­cause they re­quire a longer lead time to com­plete.</p>
    <p>It may be hard for dig­i­tal na­tives to quit the habit of be­ing con­nected. But it is worth the ef­fort be­cause the un­in­ter­rupted rest af­forded to work­ers may boost their men­tal health while help­ing them avoid burnout. Em­ploy­ers ben­e­fit too.</p>
    <p>“The younger gen­er­a­tion of­ten place work-life bal­ance high on their pri­or­ity list when look­ing for a new em­ployer, and hav­ing a well-rested, en­gaged and happy work­force ben­e­fits the or­gan­i­sa­tion in many ways too,” said Ms Tri­cia Tan, hu­man re­sources direc­tor (South-east Asia) at re­cruit­ment agency Robert Wal­ters.</p>
    <p>Of course any Right to Dis­con­nect law has to make al­lowances for fields such as medicine, where de­lays can be a mat­ter of life or death.</p>
    <p>Ms Tan added that those in global or re­gional roles may also have to work around the clock, as they li­aise with coun­ter­parts in dif­fer­ent time zones.</p>
    <p>De­spite th­ese chal­lenges, main­tain­ing the right to dis­con­nect boils down to hav­ing “ba­sic mu­tual re­spect” be­tween em­ploy­ers and em­ploy­ees, with both par­ties un­der­stand­ing that “peo­ple have a life out­side of work”, she said.</p>
    <p>As for me, one of my big­gest work-re­lated fears is that I will fall asleep on the job – af­ter I fin­ish writ­ing my story, but be­fore it is edited and cleared. I shud­der at be­ing la­belled an ir­re­spon­si­ble and lazy re­porter.</p>
    <p>How­ever, I have been re­as­sured by more than one col­league that if I am needed to check a story, they can sim­ply call me. Maybe that is why my anx­i­ety has sub­sided and I no longer hear the phan­tom beeps sig­nalling I have un­read mes­sages, which I used to hear when I first joined the news­room.</p>
    <p>If it is pos­si­ble to set bound­aries for how and when to be con­tacted in the news­room, where dead­lines are on an hourly ba­sis, it gives me hope that Sin­ga­pore­ans can learn to switch off from work when we have the op­por­tu­nity to do so.</p>
