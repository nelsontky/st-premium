    <p>They have a cult brand and more than 800,000 In­sta­gram fol­low­ers, but co-founders of skin­care la­bel Glow Recipe Sarah Lee and Chris­tine Chang still re­mem­ber their hum­ble be­gin­nings – stand­ing in line to au­di­tion for an Amer­i­can busi­ness re­al­ity tele­vi­sion show in 2015.</p>
    <p>They had an­swered an open call in New York City for Shark Tank (2009 to present), which in­vites start-ups to pitch their busi­nesses to a panel of in­vestors called Sharks. Then, Glow Recipe was an on­line mar­ket­place cu­rat­ing Kbeauty brands and skin­care ed­u­ca­tion for the Amer­i­can mar­ket.</p>
    <p>Ms Lee tells The Straits Times in an e-mail in­ter­view: “To stand out from the crowd, we stood in line with sheet masks on the en­tire time.”</p>
    <p>She and Ms Chang, both Kore­anAmer­i­cans in their 30s, met as col­leagues at L’Oreal Korea. They were speak­ing to ST about their brand’s de­but in Sin­ga­pore and South-east Asia – via beauty re­tailer Sephora on Aug 20.</p>
    <p>“There was never a guar­an­tee we would make it to the live show,” Ms Lee adds.</p>
    <p>But they did – and even made it on air in Sea­son 7 in 2015, where they re­ceived three out of five in­vest­ment of­fers from the Sharks and ac­cepted Cana­dian busi­ness­man Robert Her­javec’s.</p>
    <p>Though they ended up turn­ing down his of­fer after dis­cus­sions of­f­cam­era, Ms Lee says Shark Tank “re­ally shaped the foun­da­tion of where we are to­day and took our busi­ness to a new level”.</p>
    <p>After the episode aired, the Glow Recipe site went down due to an im­mense spike in on­line traf­fic, she re­calls. The team had to help the ware­house staff pack ship­ments by hand for the next few weeks.</p>
    <p>“The episode re­ally put us on the map with view­ers and opened a lot of doors and op­por­tu­ni­ties for our brand,” Ms Lee says.</p>
    <p>On the dime of other in­vestors, the plat­form grew steadily. In 2017, they switched from cu­rat­ing to cre­at­ing, launch­ing their own in­house skin­care line of fruit-based, clean prod­ucts.</p>
    <p>Their line-up to­day com­prises su­per­food-for­ward prod­ucts in mil­len­nial-friendly pack­ag­ing, each spot­light­ing trendy in­gre­di­ents like AHAs (alpha hy­droxy acids), vi­ta­min C and retinol. The in­no­va­tions are in­spired by South Korean beauty trends and age-old treat­ments, like the pop­u­lar aqua peel fa­cial both founders of­ten get when vis­it­ing South Korea.</p>
    <p>Of their de­but prod­uct and best­seller, the Wa­ter­melon Glow Sleep­ing Mask, Ms Chang says: “Wa­ter­melon was not com­monly used in skin­care at the time, and we wanted to make sure the ex­pe­ri­ence and tex­ture was as evoca­tive of the child­hood mem­o­ries we had of our grand­moth­ers rub­bing cold wa­ter­melon rind on our skin to soothe heat rash and ir­ri­ta­tion.”</p>
    <p>It sold out mul­ti­ple times at launch and had a wait­ing list “thou­sands long”, she adds. To date, it re­mains their proud­est prod­uct. It will cost $69 here, with the full range of prod­ucts priced from $16 to $75.</p>
    <p>In­deed, the duo’s Korean her­itage is some­thing they take pride in – and have used to their ad­van­tage.</p>
    <p>When Glow Recipe started as an e-tailer in 2014, K-beauty was on the cusp of ex­plod­ing in the United States, says Ms Lee.</p>
    <p>“Many K-beauty brands were be­ing sold with a more pro­mo­tional, dis­count-fo­cused ap­proach, in­stead of telling the story be­hind the per­for­mance and in­no­va­tion of the prod­ucts. Peo­ple didn’t re­ally know what K-beauty meant or were mis­in­formed about it be­ing an over­whelm­ing, 10- to 15-step rou­tine.</p>
    <p>“We knew we’d uniquely be able to lever­age our com­bined 20 years of bi­cul­tural beauty in­dus­try ex­pe­ri­ence. Our ex­per­tise as global mar­ke­teers and de­vel­op­ers, and the ex­pe­ri­ence of work­ing for L’Oreal, gave us the tools to bridge the gap be­tween Korea and the US con­sumer.”</p>
    <p>Their first-mover ad­van­tage aside, they be­lieve it is their trans­parency that has helped the three-year-old skin­care line see such suc­cess. “A huge part of our busi­ness model is cre­at­ing ed­u­ca­tion and skin­care tu­to­ri­als with each launch,” says Ms Lee.</p>
    <p>On so­cial me­dia, the duo front videos on their prod­uct for­mu­la­tions and uses, in­clud­ing go­ing be­hind the scenes to look at how a prod­uct is made in Glow Recipe’s lab­o­ra­to­ries in South Korea. They call it “skin­ter­tain­ment”.</p>
    <p>After grow­ing rapidly in the US, Aus­tralia, New Zealand and Bri­tain, the brand’s South-east Asia launch has been hotly an­tic­i­pated.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore is “one of the re­gions outside of the US where we have the highest fol­low­ing on so­cial me­dia”, says Ms Chang. “And Sephora was one of the first brands to be­lieve in our mis­sion and pur­pose.”</p>
    <p>Ms Lee adds: “We can’t wait for our brand and story to res­onate with the Asian con­sumer, in­clud­ing those in Korea. Korean beauty is part of our her­itage and will al­ways be at the core of our skin­care phi­los­o­phy.”</p>
