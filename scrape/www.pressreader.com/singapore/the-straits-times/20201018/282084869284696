    <p>When tack­ling an event like The Straits Times Vir­tual Run’s 175km chal­lenge, which needs to be bro­ken up into sev­eral ses­sions, you should pay at­ten­tion to the routes you choose to run on.</p>
    <p>The event is equiv­a­lent to about four marathons and you have been given eight weeks to com­plete it.</p>
    <p>Here are some things to con­sider:</p>
    <p>Should you run the same route ev­ery day?</p>
    <p>Go­ing through the same daily rou­tine to get to work, at work or even af­ter work might get bor­ing for the ma­jor­ity of us and we crave some­thing new and some­thing to look for­ward to.</p>
    <p>So ex­plor­ing new routes and small al­leys which you never knew ex­isted may be a good way to heighten your run­ning ex­pe­ri­ence.</p>
    <p>An­other less com­mon and ob­vi­ous point to run­ners: You might not be aware but run­ning the same route daily may also lead to in­juries or phys­i­cal im­bal­ance. By pass­ing the same ar­eas, go­ing around the same bend or cor­ners, and hav­ing the same mo­tion while run­ning ev­ery day, it may bring about an im­bal­ance in mus­cle de­vel­op­ment.</p>
    <p>Also, be­ing overly fa­mil­iar with your route may bring about com­pla­cency and the like­li­hood of zon­ing out dur­ing the run, re­sult­ing in po­ten­tial falls.</p>
    <p>The lack of va­ri­ety might even­tu­ally lead to a plateau in fit­ness lev­els. By re­peat­ing the same mo­tion with sim­i­lar in­ten­sity, the body is re­peat­edly stress­ing the same stres­sor. With this, it might start to adapt and not re­act as well to the stres­sors, lead­ing to a plateau in fit­ness.</p>
    <p>What are the ad­van­tages of do­ing dif­fer­ent routes?</p>
    <p>Hav­ing the op­tion of dif­fer­ent routes can en­cour­age in­di­vid­u­als to dis­cover new places and even have a dif­fer­ent view of places they have driven past.</p>
    <p>Run­ners who con­tin­u­ously ex­plore new routes can en­joy the dif­fer­ent ter­rain and scenery; to find what they truly en­joy and need at that point.</p>
    <p>This not only helps to re­fresh and recharge our men­tal as­pects but also im­prove our fit­ness lev­els with the vary­ing de­grees of dif­fi­culty.</p>
    <p>Dif­fer­ent routes can present vary­ing de­grees of dif­fi­culty each time; some routes may have hills or var­i­ous ter­rain such as grass, sand, trail or gravel. Each route will bring on its own set of fun and chal­lenges which en­tice in­di­vid­u­als to try and over­come them.</p>
    <p>Us­ing these chal­leng­ing climbs and ter­rain to im­prove their fit­ness lev­els, run­ners may feel more con­fi­dent and com­fort­able when they re­turn to their usual route.</p>
    <p>They will be more aware of what their body is ca­pa­ble of then, and might gain more mo­ti­va­tion and plea­sure in run­ning.</p>
    <p>Is there an ad­van­tage of run­ning on dif­fer­ent ter­rain?</p>
    <p>Run­ning on dif­fer­ent ter­rain will help to work dif­fer­ent mus­cle groups and in­crease the run­ner’s over­all strength over time.</p>
    <p>This im­prove­ment in strength and en­durance can also help re­duce chances of in­jury and en­hance one’s run­ning per­for­mance as well. More im­por­tantly, the re­duc­tion in fre­quency of the same route will help to re­duce mus­cle im­bal­ance as men­tioned ear­lier.</p>
    <p>Al­though run­ning on hilly ter­rain may slow your pace down, it helps to build var­i­ous mus­cle groups such as our glutes, ham­strings, calves and quadri­ceps.</p>
    <p>The strength built from run­ning on hilly ter­rain can help to im­prove speed when run­ning on flat ground.</p>
    <p>Run­ning on soft ter­rain such as grass can help to re­duce the im­pact on joints (es­pe­cially dur­ing land­ing).</p>
    <p>It is also good for in­di­vid­u­als who are re­turn­ing from in­jury to start on softer ter­rain.</p>
    <p>Those who have been run­ning fre­quently on hard sur­faces, such as tar­mac or con­crete, should also ex­plore softer ter­rain, as these hard sur­faces place more stress on our bones and joints.</p>
    <p>An al­ter­na­tive to grass would be trails where run­ners of­ten ex­pe­ri­ence stun­ning scenery.</p>
    <p>How­ever, they will have to pay ex­tra at­ten­tion to the ground as there may be fallen branches, rocks and roots.</p>
    <p>For new run­ners, it is good to choose a flat­ter and well-con­di­tioned trail (for ex­am­ple Coney Is­land) at the start to strengthen the nec­es­sary mus­cle groups and gain ex­pe­ri­ence.</p>
    <p>With more dif­fi­cult trails, these may of­fer un­for­giv­ing path­ways which chal­lenge run­ners to strengthen and im­prove their an­kle and hip sta­bil­ity.</p>
    <p>So do plan to have a va­ri­ety of runs. Avoid re­peat­ing the same route/ter­rain as it may pose more harm than good in the long run.</p>
    <p>Each ter­rain has its own pros and cons, de­pend­ing on the fit­ness and com­fort level of the run­ner, so choose your routes care­fully.</p>
