    <p>• Ja­panese film-maker Hirokazu Koreeda will take on his first South Korean movie with top­tier ac­tors Song Kang-ho (Par­a­site, 2019), Bae Doo-na (King­dom, 2019) and Gang Dong-won (Train To Bu­san: Penin­sula, 2020), ac­cord­ing to the film’s dis­trib­u­tor CJ ENM.</p>
    <p>Ten­ta­tively ti­tled Bro­ker, the film is a drama about peo­ple in­volved with “baby boxes” – tem­per­a­ture­con­trolled con­tain­ers into which un­wanted new­borns are dropped.</p>
    <p>The Ja­panese writer and direc­tor, who is fa­mous for his nu­anced por­traits of fam­i­lies that re­veal their com­plex­i­ties and re­al­i­ties, is one of the Cannes Film Fes­ti­val’s favourite Ja­panese film-mak­ers. His films have been in com­pe­ti­tion five times at the fes­ti­val, with Like Fa­ther, Like Son win­ning the jury prize in 2013 and Shoplifter­s nab­bing the Palme D’or in 2018.</p>
    <p>Koreeda pre­vi­ously worked with Bae in 2009’s Air Doll, in which the Korean ac­tress played the lead char­ac­ter, air doll No­zomi. Bro­ker will be his first col­lab­o­ra­tion with Song and Gang, who pre­vi­ously starred to­gether in Korean thriller flick Se­cret Union in 2010.</p>
    <p>“Back in 2009, I promised Bae that ‘we would col­lab­o­rate again, next time, as a hu­man char­ac­ter’ and I have come to keep this prom­ise af­ter 10 years,” Koreeda said in a state­ment re­leased in Korean by the dis­trib­u­tor.</p>
    <p>“In­clud­ing th­ese three ac­tors, I am able to make this film with the help of other Korean ac­tors and film staff who I have revered.”</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to the state­ment, the direc­tor has been work­ing on the up­com­ing film’s script with the Korean pro­duc­ers for about five years.</p>
    <p>“I feel my heart flut­ter­ing the most right now, as I am writ­ing the script, mov­ing around the three vet­eran ac­tors in­side my mind. I hope to make a film through which I could share this feel­ing – dole­ful, yet thrilling and heart­break­ing at times,” Koreeda said.</p>
    <p>CJ ENM, which also dis­trib­uted Korea’s Cannes- and Os­car-win­ning Par­a­site last year, said Bro­ker is ex­pected to kick off pro­duc­tion next year.</p>
