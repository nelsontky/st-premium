    <p>Last De­cem­ber, the Or­gan­i­sa­tion for Eco­nomic Co­op­er­a­tion and De­vel­op­ment (OECD) sounded a warn­ing bell on young peo­ple’s abil­ity to read with dis­cern­ment and ac­cess the right in­for­ma­tion on­line.</p>
    <p>The re­sults of the Pro­gramme for In­ter­na­tional Stu­dent As­sess­ment (Pisa) 2018 un­der­lined the press­ing need for young peo­ple to re­learn how to read, be­cause read­ing and ac­cess­ing i nfor­ma­tion on­line re­quires dif­fer­ent skills, the think-tank’s ed­u­ca­tion and skills di­rec­tor An­dreas Sch­le­icher pointed out.</p>
    <p>Pisa, which is con­ducted by the OECD ev­ery three years, mea­sures how well stu­dents use their math­e­mat­ics, sci­ence and read­ing skills to solve prob­lems.</p>
    <p>It also stud­ies other trends in ed­u­ca­tion, in­clud­ing read­ing habits and In­ter­net us­age.</p>
    <p>Some 600,000 15-year-olds from 79 coun­tries took part in Pisa 2018 and the read­ing test re­sults showed that youth lacked the skills to read with dis­cern­ment, in­clud­ing the abil­ity to dif­fer­en­ti­ate be­tween fact and opin­ion, when they were on­line.</p>
    <p>In his re­marks to The Straits Times, Dr Sch­le­icher said it was wor­ry­ing that the read­ing test re­sults showed that fewer than one in 10 stu­dents at­tained Lev­els 5 or 6 – the top lev­els.</p>
    <p>That means the vast ma­jor­ity of them were not able to com­pre­hend lengthy texts, deal with con­cepts that are ab­stract or coun­ter­in­tu­itive, and tell the dif­fer­ence be­tween fact and opin­ion.</p>
    <p>Even in Sin­ga­pore, the coun­try ranked sec­ond for read­ing and with the largest share of top per­form­ers, only one in four 15-yearold stu­dents was able to reach these lev­els.</p>
    <p>OECD said in its re­port that while im­proved ac­cess to new tech­nolo­gies pro­vides un­prece­dented op­por­tu­ni­ties, it also raises the ques­tion of whether stu­dents have mas­tered the com­plex skills re­quired to thrive in the new world dom­i­nated by tech­nol­ogy.</p>
    <p>Dr Sch­le­icher pointed out how read­ing and com­pre­hend­ing in­for­ma­tion on­line is a very com­plex skill.</p>
    <p>“In the past, stu­dents could find clear and of­ten sin­gu­lar an­swers to their ques­tions in care­fully cu­rated and gov­ern­ment-ap­proved text­books, and they could trust those an­swers to be true.</p>
    <p>“To­day, they will find hun­dreds of thou­sands of an­swers to their ques­tions on­line, and it is up to them to fig­ure out what is true and what is false, what is right and what is wrong,” he said.</p>
    <p>The In­ter­net and mo­bile tech­nolo­gies have trans­formed the ways in which peo­ple read and ex­change in­for­ma­tion.</p>
    <p>And dig­i­tal­i­sa­tion has re­sulted in the emer­gence of new forms of text, rang­ing from the con­cise – such as text mes­sages and tweets – to length­ier forms, such as mul­ti­page web­sites.</p>
    <p>And it is not just dif­fer­ent for­mats – the speed and vol­ume of in­for­ma­tion flow have cre­ated per­fect con­di­tions for fake news to thrive.</p>
    <p>This re­quires young peo­ple to learn how to read bet­ter, not so much in terms of greater flu­ency, but with more dis­cern­ment.</p>
    <p>Young peo­ple must be taught to dif­fer­en­ti­ate fact from opin­ion and to form their own views. They have to be taught to guard against as­ser­tions that may “feel right”, but which are not based on fact.</p>
    <p>When they are on so­cial me­dia plat­forms, they must re­alise that al­go­rithms sort ne­ti­zens into groups of like-minded in­di­vid­u­als, re­sult­ing in these plat­forms be­com­ing echo cham­bers that am­plify sim­i­lar views and leave in­di­vid­u­als in­su­lated from op­pos­ing ar­gu­ments and views.</p>
    <p>As Dr Sch­le­icher put it: “Just be­cause every­body ‘likes’ or agrees with them on In­sta­gram or TikTok, it does not mean some­thing is cor­rect. It just means the so­cial me­dia fil­ters have fil­tered out those with op­pos­ing views.”</p>
    <p>He stressed that tech­nol­ogy presents chil­dren with the in­flu­ences, choices and de­ci­sions that pre­vi­ous gen­er­a­tions never had to con­tend with, which un­der­scores the ur­gent need to learn to read in a dif­fer­ent way.</p>
    <p>Schools around the world and in Sin­ga­pore are al­ready re­dou­bling their ef­forts to pre­pare stu­dents to nav­i­gate the on­line world.</p>
    <p>In Sin­ga­pore, the na­tional dig­i­tal lit­er­acy pro­gramme in­cludes cur­ricu­lum changes to nur­ture dig­i­tal lit­er­acy skills. Char­ac­ter and Cit­i­zen­ship Ed­u­ca­tion mod­ules will be up­dated to help stu­dents with­stand on­line pres­sures.</p>
    <p>As Min­istry of Ed­u­ca­tion of­fi­cials pointed out, dig­i­tal lit­er­acy does not re­fer to the abil­ity to code or build web­sites, but to func­tion ef­fec­tively in the on­line world.</p>
    <p>One of the most im­por­tant skills re­quired for that is the abil­ity to ac­cess use­ful in­for­ma­tion on­line.</p>
    <p>Read­ing ex­perts such as Ms Les­lie Davis from the Bri­tish Coun­cil Sin­ga­pore said par­ents, too, must and can play a part in nur­tur­ing higher-level read­ing skills in their chil­dren.</p>
    <p>And they need not wait till their chil­dren are teenagers to start guid­ing them to read with dis­cern­ment.</p>
    <p>“It’s as sim­ple as ask­ing ope­nended ‘why’ ques­tions when read­ing a book with their chil­dren,” she added.</p>
    <p>As Dr Sch­le­icher said: “For those armed with the right knowl­edge and skills, a dig­i­talised and glob­alised world presents rich op­por­tu­ni­ties. But those who are in­suf­fi­ciently pre­pared will find their prospects lim­ited.”</p>

    <p>Re­search into the ben­e­fits of read­ing has shown a clear link be­tween read­ing for plea­sure and aca­demic achieve­ments, but the lat­est Pro­gramme for In­ter­na­tional Stu­dent As­sess­ment (Pisa) study found that fewer 15-year-olds are en­joy­ing read­ing.</p>
    <p>Be­yond the req­ui­site knowl­edge and skills, Pisa 2018 also sur­veyed stu­dents around the world on their read­ing habits.</p>
    <p>It found that stu­dents seem to read less for leisure and to read fewer fic­tion books, mag­a­zines or news­pa­pers be­cause they want to (as op­posed to be­cause they have to).</p>
    <p>In­stead, they read more to ful­fil prac­ti­cal needs and they read more in on­line for­mats, such as chats, on­line news or web­sites con­tain­ing prac­ti­cal in­for­ma­tion.</p>
    <p>In 2018, more stu­dents con­sid­ered read­ing “a waste of time” (+5 per­cent­age points, on av­er­age across mem­ber coun­tries of the Or­gan­i­sa­tion for Eco­nomic Co­op­er­a­tion and De­vel­op­ment).</p>
    <p>And fewer stu­dents read for en­joy­ment (-5 per­cent­age points) than their coun­ter­parts did in 2009.</p>
    <p>All this is bad news for those pro­mot­ing read­ing among young peo­ple.</p>
    <p>Sev­eral stud­ies have shown that it was not just the daily act of read­ing, but also the en­joy­ment of it, that made the dif­fer­ence. Hence the phrase “read­ing for plea­sure”.</p>
    <p>Stud­ies have found that daily read­ing for plea­sure pos­i­tively af­fects men­tal health, self­es­teem, vo­cab­u­lary, gen­eral knowl­edge, re­la­tion­ships, mood con­trol, em­pa­thy, sel­f­un­der­stand­ing and stress lev­els.</p>
    <p>When a child reads for plea­sure, he de­vel­ops the ca­pac­ity to im­merse him­self in the story, visu­alise mean­ings, re­late to char­ac­ters and par­tic­i­pate in mak­ing mean­ing.</p>
    <p>The child re­lates to the char­ac­ters and him­self by ex­plor­ing and stak­ing his iden­tity. This plea­sure de­vel­ops the ca­pac­ity to ex­pe­ri­ence the world from other per­spec­tives; to learn from and ap­pre­ci­ate oth­ers.</p>
