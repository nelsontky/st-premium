    <p>TOKYO • Ja­pan must act to tackle “ram­pant” abuse of youth ath­letes by sports coaches be­fore it hosts the Tokyo 2020 Olympics next year, ac­tivists said on Wed­nes­day.</p>
    <p>The call comes af­ter a new re­port warned that abu­sive be­hav­iour by sports coaches re­mained com­mon in the coun­try.</p>
    <p>Hu­man Rights Watch “found that child abuse is still ram­pant in sports train­ing through­out Ja­panese schools, fed­er­a­tions and elite sports”, the watch­dog’s na­tional di­rec­tor Kanae Doi told re­porters.</p>
    <p>“While the topic of child abuse in sports is a global prob­lem, we chose to fo­cus on Ja­pan for 2020 be­cause the Olympics and Par­a­lympics are com­ing to Ja­pan,” she said.</p>
    <p>“Ev­ery Ja­panese knows un­for­tu­nately that cor­po­ral pun­ish­ment has been preva­lent in Ja­panese sports.”</p>
    <p>The group doc­u­mented the ex­pe­ri­ences of more than 800 for­mer child ath­letes, in­clud­ing Olympians, in 50 sports across the na­tion.</p>
    <p>It found many had been punched, kicked or ver­bally abused, while oth­ers re­ported be­ing or­dered to eat ex­ces­sively, train even when in­jured or were de­nied wa­ter.</p>
    <p>“I was hit so many times I can­not count,” one ath­lete told the group.</p>
    <p>The is­sue is one that haunts Keiko Kobayashi, whose son was a tal­ented 15-year-old ju­doka when his coach used a chok­ing tech­nique on him and threw him to the floor, caus­ing se­vere brain in­juries.</p>
    <p>“I want to teach chil­dren that this is abuse,” Kobayashi, 70, told AFP.</p>
    <p>“I want to teach them to raise their voice.”</p>
    <p>The coach was not pros­e­cuted be­cause the in­jury oc­curred dur­ing prac­tice, and he con­tin­ues to work as a school teacher and judo in­struc­tor, Kobayashi said.</p>
    <p>Her son, now 30, is still suf­fer­ing the ef­fects of his in­jury and re­quires close su­per­vi­sion by his fam­ily and med­i­cal pro­fes­sion­als.</p>
    <p>Abuse in Ja­panese sport has made head­lines in re­cent years.</p>
    <p>In 2018, a 13-year-old boy in a school bad­minton team killed him­self. His par­ents ac­cused the boy’s coach of long­stand­ing ver­bal in­sults and abuse.</p>
    <p>Vi­o­lence is also of­ten re­ported in Ja­pan’s sumo sta­bles and, in 2013, a na­tional Olympic judo coach stepped down af­ter elite ju­dokas ac­cused him of abuse and vi­o­lence.</p>
    <p>But ac­tivists say young ath­letes are of­ten afraid to re­port abuse be­cause Ja­pan’s cul­ture em­pha­sises re­spect for elders, leav­ing coaches to con­tinue their ha­rass­ment.</p>
    <p>“I think a real prob­lem here is that we have ac­cepted this prac­tice. And this is due to our cul­ture and so­cial norms,” said Takuya Ya­mazaki, a sports lawyer who worked on the HRW re­port.</p>
    <p>HRW wants to see tougher ac­tion from the gov­ern­ment, specif­i­cally tar­get­ing the abuse of young ath­letes, in­clud­ing the es­tab­lish­ment of an in­de­pen­dent body that would de­cer­tify abu­sive coaches.</p>
    <p>“When Tokyo 2020 starts, I wish Ja­pan will be proud of its re­form to pro­tect its own chil­dren from abuse in sports and em­brace this re­form as an im­por­tant and last­ing legacy,” Doi said.</p>
    <p>Ath­lete abuse, how­ever, is not an is­sue in Ja­pan alone.</p>
    <p>On Thurs­day, for­mer Sin­ga­pore na­tional fig­ure skater Yu Shu­ran re­vealed that she too had been abused while train­ing in China.</p>
    <p>The 19-year-old said that from the age of 11, she had been hit re­peat­edly by coaches, some­times with skat­ing blades that drew blood from her shins.</p>
    <p>She added that she got through the abuse by “numb­ing it out”.</p>
    <p>The BBC also re­ported that dozens of Aus­tralia’s for­mer top gym­nasts have spo­ken out about men­tal and phys­i­cal abuse within the na­tion’s elite pro­gramme.</p>
    <p>In sto­ries shared on­line, many ar­gued that coaches had nor­malised a “toxic” en­vi­ron­ment.</p>
    <p>Ear­lier this month, Bri­tish Olympic gym­nasts Becky and El­lie Downie also claimed abu­sive be­hav­iour in gym­nas­tics had be­come “com­pletely nor­malised” and sev­eral ath­letes told the BBC of “a cul­ture of fear” in the sport.</p>
    <p>In South Korea, triath­lete Choi Suk-hyeon, 22, took her own life ear­lier this month af­ter years of phys­i­cal and ver­bal abuse from coaches and hav­ing her com­plaints to sport­ing au­thor­i­ties al­legedly ig­nored, ac­cord­ing to re­ports.</p>
    <p>SPEAK OUT</p>
    <p>I want to teach chil­dren that this is abuse. I want to teach them to raise their voice.</p>
    <p>’’</p>
