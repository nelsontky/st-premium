    <p>Brunei’s Prince ‘Ab­dul ‘Azim died of mul­ti­ple or­gan fail­ure due to an au­toim­mune dis­ease, his younger brother re­vealed on Tues­day.</p>
    <p>Prince ‘Ab­dul Ma­teen said in an In­sta­gram post that his brother was di­ag­nosed with se­vere sys­temic vas­culi­tis ear­lier this year, a con­di­tion char­ac­terised by in­flam­ma­tion of blood ves­sel walls.</p>
    <p>“At the same time, he was also cop­ing with bipo­lar disor­der which made the fight harder,” said Prince ‘Ab­dul Ma­teen.</p>
    <p>“Even­tu­ally, my brother suc­cumbed to mul­ti­ple or­gan fail­ure caused by per­sis­tent in­fec­tions due to the au­toim­mune dis­ease.”</p>
    <p>Prince ‘Ab­dul ‘Azim died last Saturday and was laid to rest at the Royal Mau­soleum on the same day. He was 38.</p>
    <p>Brunei is now in a seven-day mourn­ing pe­riod.</p>
    <p>Prince ‘Ab­dul Ma­teen, 29, said he shared the de­tails of his brother’s death as that was what the late prince would have wanted. “He was a big ad­vo­cate of bring­ing aware­ness to dif­fer­ent causes,” said Prince ‘Ab­dul Ma­teen.</p>
    <p>The post was ac­com­pa­nied by a black and white child­hood pic­ture of them hav­ing fun.</p>
    <p>Pay­ing trib­ute to his elder brother, Prince ‘Ab­dul Ma­teen said there was never a dull day when “Abang Azim” was around.</p>
    <p>“He loved to al­ways prank us, joke around and never took life too se­ri­ously. His laugh­ter was so con­ta­gious that re­gard­less of whether the thing was funny or not, ev­ery­one would end up laugh­ing too. He def­i­nitely lived life to the fullest.</p>
    <p>“I spent ev­ery day of my child­hood with my brother – he taught me so much and made me who I am today and for that I am eter­nally grate­ful.”</p>
    <p>Fourth in line to suc­ceed the throne of Brunei, Prince ‘Ab­dul ‘Azim was the sec­ond-born prince of Brunei’s ruler, Sul­tan Has­sanal Bolkiah.</p>
    <p>He was born in Ban­dar Seri Be­gawan on July 29, 1982, and stud­ied at In­ter­na­tional School Brunei, Sin­ga­pore’s Raf­fles In­sti­tu­tion and Ox­ford Brookes Univer­sity in Eng­land.</p>
    <p>NBC news re­ported that the late prince had a Lon­don-based pro­duc­tion com­pany called Daryl Prince Pro­duc­tions and that he had a stint as a Hol­ly­wood movie pro­ducer.</p>
    <p>His cred­its, un­der the name Azim Bolkiah, in­cluded the 2014 movie You’re Not You star­ring Hil­lary Swank, and 2018’s The Happy Prince with Ru­pert Everett and Colin Firth.</p>
    <p>For­eign news out­lets have of­ten re­ported on Prince ‘Ab­dul ‘Azim’s glam­orous life­style, splash­ing pic­tures of him with nu­mer­ous A-list celebri­ties.</p>
    <p>Over the years, those he had rubbed shoul­ders with in­cluded</p>
    <p>Mariah Carey, El­iz­a­beth Hurley and Michael Jack­son.</p>
    <p>His celebrity friends were quick to pay trib­ute to him.</p>
    <p>Amer­i­can ac­tor Kevin McHale de­scribed the prince as a “true light” on Twit­ter, say­ing that he was al­ways gen­er­ous and welcoming, while on In­sta­gram, vet­eran English ac­tress Joan Collins up­loaded a pic­ture of her­self at a res­tau­rant with Prince ‘Ab­dul ‘Azim and model and ac­tress Jerry Hall.</p>
    <p>“Rest In Peace #princeazim – you were a good friend to me and ev­ery­one that was lucky to know you. #life­giver #an­gel #rip­princeazim,” she wrote.</p>
    <p>Singer Janet Jack­son took to her In­sta­gram story to post: “Azim, I love you too and in­syal­lah (God will­ing) no more pain. In the name of the most high, the most mer­ci­ful, He will take care of you now. Ameen.”</p>
    <p>As much as he was known for his glam­orous life­style, Prince ‘Ab­dul ‘Azim was also known for his sup­port of char­i­ta­ble causes.</p>
    <p>The Times news­pa­per re­ported that he de­signed uni­sex week­end bags for lux­ury fash­ion la­bel MCM, with the pro­ceeds go­ing to the Make-A-Wish Foun­da­tion char­ity in Bri­tain for crit­i­cally ill chil­dren.</p>
    <p>In 2011, he lent his sup­port to a char­ity gala in Brunei to raise aware­ness of autism.</p>
    <p>“I think it is im­por­tant for me to be here and show my sup­port. I think you have to look af­ter what is at home be­fore you do any­thing else. You have to do what you can with what you have,” he told The Brunei Times in an ex­clu­sive in­ter­view.</p>
