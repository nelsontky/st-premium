    <p>WASH­ING­TON • The United States has re­versed a de­ci­sion to bring an air­craft car­rier home from the Gulf, with the Pen­tagon say­ing that due to “re­cent threats” by Iran the USS Nimitz would stay in po­si­tion.</p>
    <p>The Nimitz has been pa­trolling Gulf wa­ters since Novem­ber, but in a state­ment is­sued on Dec 31, Act­ing US De­fence Sec­re­tary Christo­pher Miller or­dered the ves­sel to “tran­sit di­rectly home to com­plete a nearly 10-month de­ploy­ment”.</p>
    <p>The New York Times, quot­ing US of­fi­cials, said this move was part of a “de-es­ca­la­tory” sig­nal to Te­heran to avoid a con­flict in Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump’s last days in of­fice.</p>
    <p>How­ever, Mr Miller is­sued a new state­ment chang­ing course on Sun­day. “Due to the re­cent threats is­sued by Ira­nian lead­ers against Pres­i­dent Trump and other US govern­ment of­fi­cials, I have or­dered the USS Nimitz to halt its rou­tine re­de­ploy­ment,” he said.</p>
    <p>“The USS Nimitz will now re­main on sta­tion in the US Cen­tral Com­mand area of op­er­a­tions. No one should doubt the re­solve” of the US. He did not elab­o­rate on the threats in­volved.</p>
    <p>His state­ment came one year af­ter a US drone strike in Bagh­dad killed Ira­nian com­man­der Qasem</p>
    <p>Soleimani and his Iraqi lieu­tenant Abu Mahdi al-Muhan­dis. Thou­sands of Iraqis chanted “re­venge” and “no to Amer­ica” on Sun­day.</p>
    <p>The an­niver­sary of the Bagh­dad drone strike was also marked in re­cent days across Iran and by sup­port­ers in Syria, Le­banon, Ye­men and else­where.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump uni­lat­er­ally with­drew the US from a land­mark nu­clear deal be­tween Iran and world pow­ers in 2018 and launched a “max­i­mum pres­sure” cam­paign against Te­heran, reim­pos­ing and re­in­forc­ing crip­pling sanc­tions.</p>
    <p>The two na­tions have twice come to the brink of war since June 2019, es­pe­cially af­ter Gen­eral Soleimani’s killing. Days af­ter the gen­eral’s death, Iran launched mis­siles at Iraqi bases hous­ing US and other coali­tion troops, with Mr Trump re­frain­ing from any fur­ther mil­i­tary re­sponse.</p>
