    <p>A re­tiree is su­ing United Over­seas Bank (UOB) and a former re­la­tion­ship man­ager at the bank af­ter suf­fer­ing losses to­talling $1.15 mil­lion. Madam Tan Swan Choo, 72, said she was de­ceived by Mr Keigo Lam Yew Kai into be­liev­ing that she had put her money into in­vest­ment ve­hi­cles sanc­tioned by UOB, when they were in fact un­se­cured loans to a com­pany.</p>
    <p>A 72-year-old re­tiree is su­ing United Over­seas Bank (UOB) and a former re­la­tion­ship man­ager at the bank af­ter suf­fer­ing losses to­talling $1.15 mil­lion.</p>
    <p>Madam Tan Swan Choo said she was de­ceived by Mr Keigo Lam Yew Kai into be­liev­ing she had put her money into in­vest­ment ve­hi­cles sanc­tioned by UOB, when they were in fact un­se­cured loans to Broad­well, a com­pany i ncor­po­rated in the Bri­tish Vir­gin Is­lands.</p>
    <p>At the heart of the case is a dis­pute over whether Madam Tan was a naive re­tiree who was tricked into making un­wise i nvest­ments, or whether she was an ex­pe­ri­enced in­vestor who knew ex­actly what she was get­ting into.</p>
    <p>Mr Lam, 36, was as­sis­tant vicepres­i­dent of UOB’s Priv­i­lege Bank­ing team when he first met Madam Tan some time in Jan­uary 2018.</p>
    <p>They were in­tro­duced by Madam Tan’s son Jonathan Kang at a buf­fet lunch meet­ing, at which Madam Tan’s other son, Jason, was also pre­sent.</p>
    <p>Both par­ties agree on this but their ac­counts about what tran­spired then and at sev­eral other lunch meet­ings over the next year or so dif­fer widely.</p>
    <p>Madam Tan, who is rep­re­sented by Chia Wong Cham­bers, said in her state­ment of claim filed last month that Mr Lam in­tro­duced an in­vest­ment op­por­tu­nity to her when her sons stepped away to re­plen­ish their food.</p>
    <p>She said she asked him if the ve­hi­cle was “safe and se­cure”, as she had little in her Cen­tral Prov­i­dent Fund ac­count and the monies in her</p>
    <p>UOB bank ac­count were her re­tire­ment sav­ings. She said she stressed to him that she pri­ori­tised se­cu­rity above in­ter­est rates.</p>
    <p>In her state­ment, Madam Tan said Mr Lam as­sured her the in­vest­ment was “safe and se­cure”. She said she be­lieved he was ad­vis­ing her in his ca­pac­ity as an em­ployee of UOB since he had given her his name card. Be­cause of that, she thought the in­vest­ment was au­tho­rised or en­dorsed by UOB, and pro­ceeded to in­vest a sum of $600,000 soon af­ter­wards.</p>
    <p>For the next year, she re­ceived monthly in­ter­est and when her “in­vest­ment” ma­tured a year later, she said Mr Lam ad­vised her to re­new it. Madam Tan said she trans­ferred $500,000 for this sec­ond in­vest­ment. Shortly af­ter, she said Mr Lam ad­vised her to make an­other in­vest­ment, and she agreed to put in $650,000 this time.</p>
    <p>How­ever, the promised in­ter­est pay­ments of 5.4 per cent and 5.1 per cent per an­num on the in­vest­ments soon stopped. Madam Tan said her son Jason then tried to ar­range a meet­ing with Mr Lam, who stopped re­spond­ing.</p>
    <p>In De­cem­ber last year, her son Jonathan in­formed UOB of what had tran­spired.</p>
    <p>In Jan­uary this year, Madam Tan said she met Mr Jef­frey Beh, ex­ec­u­tive di­rec­tor of UOB’s le­gal depart­ment, at UOB Priv­i­lege Bank­ing Cen­tre. She said he told her the in­vest­ments had noth­ing to do with the bank but were in­stead un­se­cured loans to a com­pany in­cor­po­rated in the Bri­tish Vir­gin Is­lands known as Broad­well.</p>
    <p>Madam Tan said Mr Beh also told her that there were other UOB clients who were vic­tims and that Mr Lam had since been fired.</p>
    <p>Mr Lam, who is rep­re­sented by Prov­i­dence Law Asia LLC, de­nied any duty of care to Madam Tan.</p>
    <p>In his de­fence filed two weeks ago, he de­nied hav­ing rep­re­sented him­self to Madam Tan in his ca­pac­ity as an em­ployee of UOB or told her that the loan agree­ments with Broad­well were en­dorsed by UOB.</p>
    <p>He said Madam Tan was an ex­pe­ri­enced in­vestor who owned and op­er­ated ho­tel prop­er­ties in Aus­tralia. At their first meet­ing, she and Jason had ex­pressed in­ter­est in “pri­vate place­ment” in­vest­ments with no up­front charges and which paid out in­ter­est.</p>
    <p>In re­sponse to her in­ter­est, Mr Lam said he told her about a prom­is­sory note that was be­ing is­sued for fund­ing a Catal­ist-listed com­pany known as Epi­cen­tre Holdings. He said she and her sons were fully aware that the three agree­ments they signed were non-bank prod­ucts and were loans to Broad­well.</p>
    <p>Mr Lam said on July 17 last year, he re­ceived a text mes­sage from Jason, ask­ing if there were sup­posed to be any de­posits in re­spect of the two in­vest­ments for May and June.</p>
    <p>Mr Lam said he told Jason that the chief ex­ec­u­tive of Epi­cen­tre, Mr Ken­neth Lim, had gone miss­ing, and had very likely em­bez­zled the funds. He said he then spoke to Madam Tan regarding this and that she said she should not have been so “greedy”. Mr Lam said he had not been fired from the bank but had re­signed.</p>
    <p>In its de­fence filed on July 24, UOB dis­puted Madam Tan’s claims that the bank was re­spon­si­ble for her in­vest­ment losses. UOB, rep­re­sented by Shook Lin & Bok LLP, said the mere fur­nish­ing of Mr Lam’s UOB name card by Mr Lam to Madam Tan at a so­cial gath­er­ing did not amount to a rep­re­sen­ta­tion that Mr Lam was ad­vis­ing Madam Tan in his ca­pac­ity as the bank’s em­ployee.</p>
    <p>UOB said it was not rea­son­able for Madam Tan to have the im­pres­sion that the in­vest­ment rec­om­mended by Mr Lam had any con­nec­tion to UOB, as the con­tracts with Broad­well made no men­tion of the bank and did not bear UOB’s logo.</p>
    <p>It said it was clear the prod­uct had noth­ing to do with the bank since the in­ter­est was not cred­ited di­rectly into Madam Tan’s bank ac­count, but was de­posited into it by way of cheques not is­sued by UOB.</p>
    <p>UOB also de­nied hav­ing said there were other vic­tims or that Mr Lam had been sacked. Mr Lam, who joined UOB in 2011, re­signed from his po­si­tion on Feb 11 last year.</p>
    <p>It said Mr Lam was nei­ther Madam Tan’s con­sul­tant nor was he as­signed by UOB to be her re­la­tion­ship man­ager. Madam Tan was a mass mar­ket cus­tomer of UOB, the bank said.</p>
