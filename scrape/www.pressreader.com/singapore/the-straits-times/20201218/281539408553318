    <p>Pfizer’s Covid-19 vac­cine roll-out in the United States saw un­ex­pected hitches, in­clud­ing some vac­cines be­ing stored at overly low tem­per­a­tures and Pfizer re­port­ing po­ten­tial pro­duc­tion chal­lenges, of­fi­cials said. Pfizer’s vac­cines, made with part­ner BioNTech, are sup­posed to be kept at around mi­nus 70 deg C.</p>
    <p>WASH­ING­TON The first days of Pfizer’s Covid-19 vac­cine roll-out in the United States saw un­ex­pected hitches, in­clud­ing some vac­cines be­ing stored at overly low tem­per­a­tures and Pfizer re­port­ing po­ten­tial pro­duc­tion chal­lenges.</p>
    <p>At least two trays of vac­cine doses de­liv­ered in Cal­i­for­nia had to be re­placed af­ter their stor­age tem­per­a­tures dipped be­low mi­nus 80 deg C, US Army Gen­eral Gus­tave Perna said on Wed­nes­day.</p>
    <p>Pfizer’s vac­cines, made with part­ner BioNTech, are sup­posed to be kept at around mi­nus 70 deg C. Of­fi­cials are in­ves­ti­gat­ing if stor­ing them at ex­ces­sively cold tem­per­a­tures poses a safety or ef­fi­cacy risk.</p>
    <p>Pfizer also re­ported some pro­duc­tion is­sues, though of­fi­cials did not out­line what the spe­cific man­u­fac­tur­ing chal­lenges were.</p>
    <p>“We will en­sure that by what­ever mech­a­nism... we pro­vide them full sup­port to en­sure that they can pro­duce for the Amer­i­can peo­ple,” said Sec­re­tary of Health and Hu­man Ser­vices Alex Azar.</p>
    <p>Pfizer had ear­lier said it was ask­ing the US gov­ern­ment to use the De­fence Pro­duc­tion Act to re­lieve “crit­i­cal sup­ply lim­i­ta­tions”, par­tic­u­larly of some com­po­nents.</p>
    <p>The Food and Drug Ad­min­is­tra­tion (FDA) said that ex­tra doses from vials of the Pfizer vac­cine can be used, af­ter re­ports of phar­ma­cists throw­ing out doses due to la­belling con­fu­sion.</p>
    <p>The vials are sup­posed to hold five doses, ac­cord­ing to the la­belling, but me­dia re­ports said phar­ma­cists had found a sixth or even a sev­enth dose pos­si­ble.</p>
    <p>With­out clear ap­proval from the man­u­fac­turer, how­ever, the ex­tra doses had to be dis­carded.</p>
    <p>“Given the pub­lic health emer­gency, FDA is ad­vis­ing that it is ac­cept­able to use ev­ery full dose ob­tain­able... from each vial,” an FDA rep­re­sen­ta­tive said.</p>
    <p>“How­ever, since the vials are preser­va­tive-free, it is crit­i­cal to note that any fur­ther re­main­ing prod­uct that does not con­sti­tute a full dose should not be pooled from mul­ti­ple vials to cre­ate one.”</p>
    <p>Of­fi­cials on Wed­nes­day said they plan to al­lo­cate two mil­lion doses of the Pfizer vac­cine next week, and 5.9 mil­lion doses of Moderna’s, as­sum­ing it re­ceives reg­u­la­tory au­tho­ri­sa­tion. Moderna’s vac­cine will most likely be au­tho­rised to­day, the of­fi­cials said.</p>
    <p>The US has al­ready con­tracted for 300 mil­lion vac­cine doses be­tween the Pfizer-BioNTech shot and one from Moderna in the first half of next year, and 900 mil­lion doses in to­tal from drug mak­ers de­vel­op­ing Covid-19 vac­cines. Two doses, three or four weeks apart, are re­quired for each per­son.</p>
    <p>Vice-Pres­i­dent Mike Pence will pub­licly re­ceive the vac­cine to­day, as the Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion scram­bles to build pub­lic sup­port for a mass in­oc­u­la­tion cam­paign to staunch the deadly pan­demic.</p>
    <p>He will be the most high-pro­file re­cip­i­ent of the vac­cine to date.</p>
    <p>Pres­i­dent-elect Joe Bi­den will pub­licly re­ceive the vac­cine next week, tran­si­tion of­fi­cials said. At age 78, he is in the high-risk group for the disease. He has vowed to make the fight against the virus his top pri­or­ity when he takes of­fice.</p>
    <p>Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump, mean­while, will get the vac­cine when his med­i­cal team de­cides it is best, ac­cord­ing to the White House.</p>
    <p>In­te­rior De­part­ment Sec­re­tary David Bern­hardt tested pos­i­tive for the virus on Wed­nes­day, be­fore a planned meet­ing with Mr Trump.</p>
    <p>Mr Bern­hardt’s pos­i­tive test re­sult comes af­ter a flurry of re­cent en­coun­ters with some of the de­part­ment’s top po­lit­i­cal ap­pointees and staff, as well as a cer­e­mony to un­veil a por­trait of for­mer in­te­rior sec­re­tary Ryan Zinke last week.</p>
