    <p>Trump, Bi­den trade barbs</p>
    <p>Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump and Demo­cratic ri­val Joe Bi­den took swipes at each other on Mon­day as the pres­i­den­tial cam­paign en­tered its home­stretch on the US Labour Day hol­i­day. Mr Trump de­scribed Mr Bi­den as a threat to the econ­omy and “stupid”, while Mr Bi­den took aim at Mr Trump’s re­ported dis­parag­ing of fallen troops and his han­dling of the Covid-19 pan­demic.</p>
    <p>We know (Mr Don­ald Trump’s) been great for his rich friends, but he hasn’t been so great for the rest of us... He’s down­right un-Amer­i­can.</p>
    <p>MR JOE BI­DEN, on the US Pres­i­dent’s re­ported dis­par­age­ment of the mil­i­tary and its veter­ans.</p>
    <p>SUR­REN­DER CLAIMS</p>
    <p>(Mr Joe Bi­den) wants to sur­ren­der our coun­try to the virus, he wants to sur­ren­der our fam­i­lies to the vi­o­lent left-wing mob, and he wants to sur­ren­der our jobs to China.</p>
    <p>MIL­WAU­KEE (Wis­con­sin) • US Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump and his chal­lenger Joe Bi­den traded tough blows as the White House race en­tered its fi­nal stretch, with the Repub­li­can leader brand­ing his op­po­nent “stupid” – and the Demo­crat fir­ing back that the Pres­i­dent lacked the “guts” to tackle the Covid-19 pan­demic.</p>
    <p>As Mr Bi­den and his run­ning mate Ka­mala Har­ris took their cam­paign mes­sage to must-win swing states Penn­syl­va­nia and Wis­con­sin, Mr Trump con­vened a sur­prise news con­fer­ence at the White House on Mon­day.</p>
    <p>In a free­wheel­ing and grievance­laden per­for­mance, Mr Trump once more dan­gled the pos­si­bil­ity of a Covid-19 in­oc­u­la­tion by elec­tion day on Nov 3 – some­thing ex­perts say re­mains un­likely – and ac­cused his op­po­nents of play­ing pol­i­tics with a vac­cine af­ter Ms Har­ris said she would not take his word alone on its safety.</p>
    <p>Tout­ing an up­swing in job cre­ation – af­ter tens of mil­lions lost their j obs – and claim­ing the United States is turn­ing the cor­ner on the pan­demic, he called Mr Bi­den “stupid”, say­ing the lat­ter “wants to sur­ren­der our coun­try to the virus, he wants to sur­ren­der our fam­i­lies to the vi­o­lent left­wing mob, and he wants to sur­ren­der our jobs to China”.</p>
    <p>Labour Day in the US, the first Mon­day of Septem­ber, tra­di­tion­ally kicks off the fi­nal sprint of the race – but the ri­val cam­paigns have been knocked off stride by mul­ti­ple lay­ers of tur­moil, from the pan</p>
    <p>MR DON­ALD TRUMP, on his Demo­cratic ri­val in the pres­i­den­tial race.</p>
    <p>demic to the strug­gling econ­omy and deep racial un­rest.</p>
    <p>Can­di­dates who nor­mally would be skip­ping daily from state to state to speak be­fore big crowds are lim­it­ing their move­ments and do­ing much more vir­tu­ally. And the some­times vi­o­lent anti-racism protests and counter-protests have lent an ex­plo­sive el­e­ment to the cam­paign.</p>
    <p>Mr Bi­den headed on Mon­day to the swing state of Penn­syl­va­nia, where he held a so­cially-dis­tant meet­ing with union lead­ers be­fore tak­ing ques­tions from mem­bers of the huge AFL-CIO union at its head­quar­ters. Ad­dress­ing the event, he hit back at Mr Trump, charg­ing that “he didn’t have the guts to take on Covid”.</p>
    <p>“We know he’s been great for his rich friends, but he hasn’t been so great for the rest of us,” charged Mr Bi­den, who went on to as­sail Mr Trump over a re­port in The At­lantic mag­a­zine that the Pres­i­dent has dis­par­aged the mil­i­tary and its veter­ans.</p>
    <p>“He’s down­right un-Amer­i­can,” Mr Bi­den fumed.</p>
    <p>Though Mr Trump has dis­missed the re­port as a hoax, it ap­pears to have hit a nerve fol­low­ing a poll show­ing his sup­port below that for Mr Bi­den among ac­tive duty per­son­nel.</p>
    <p>“I’m not say­ing the mil­i­tary (lead­er­ship) is in love with me – the sol­diers are,” Mr Trump told re­porters at the White House.</p>

    <p>Joe Bi­den ar­riv­ing on Mon­day at the head­quar­ters of the AFL-CIO union in the swing state of Penn­syl­va­nia. Ad­dress­ing union mem­bers, he said Mr Trump “didn’t have the guts to take on Covid”.</p>
    <p>BAT­TLING FOR WIS­CON­SIN</p>
    <p>At 77, Mr Bi­den last week picked up the pace of cam­paign­ing but, cit­ing the Covid-19 threat, has been far more cau­tious than Mr Trump who, at 74, has ap­peared be­fore hun­dreds of sup­port­ers.</p>
    <p>Still, polls show Mr Bi­den main­tain­ing a per­sis­tent lead over Mr Trump, with both in­creas­ingly fo­cus­ing on key up­per Mid­west states like Wis­con­sin, where polling is closer – and where Mrs Hil­lary Clin­ton nar­rowly lost to Mr Trump in a 2016 shocker.</p>
    <p>Ms Har­ris, in her high­est-pro­file cam­paign sortie yet, headed to the state, where she fol­lowed in Mr Bi­den’s foot­steps by meet­ing the fam­ily of Mr Ja­cob Blake, the African Amer­i­can whose shoot­ing by po­lice touched off widespread protests last month.</p>
    <p>The sen­a­tor – the first woman of colour on a ma­jor-party pres­i­den­tial ticket – spoke by phone to Mr Blake him­self as he was re­cov­er­ing in hos­pi­tal. She later met union mem­bers and black mem­bers of the busi­ness com­mu­nity. Par­tic­i­pa­tion by black vot­ers in Wis­con­sin fell in 2016, and could prove piv­otal this year.</p>
    <p>Vice-Pres­i­dent Mike Pence also headed to the state the same day to de­liver re­marks to an en­ergy co­op­er­a­tive in the western city of La Crosse.</p>
