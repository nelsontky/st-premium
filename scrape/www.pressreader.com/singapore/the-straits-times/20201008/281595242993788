    <p>Ex­perts say tar­geted and lo­calised shut­downs are a more ef­fec­tive way of tack­ling surg­ing coro­n­avirus cases in Malaysia, af­ter the coun­try set a record high of 691 new daily cases on Tues­day. Most of these were linked to clus­ters in Sabah and Kedah, mak­ing a re­peat of the March na­tion­wide lock­down un­nec­es­sary, they said.</p>
    <p>As Malaysia sets record highs in daily coro­n­avirus cases for two straight days this week, talk has arisen of an im­pend­ing lock­down sim­i­lar to the one im­ple­mented for three months ear­lier this year.</p>
    <p>How­ever, pub­lic health ex­perts, economists and top politi­cians do not be­lieve a re­peat of the strin­gent lock­down – which had dev­as­tated the lo­cal econ­omy – would be a good so­lu­tion to the cur­rent wave of in­fec­tions.</p>
    <p>In­stead, the ex­perts say that a more tar­geted move­ment con­trol is the way to go.</p>
    <p>On Tues­day, Malaysia recorded 691 new in­fec­tions and four deaths. The num­ber of new cases was a jump from Mon­day’s 432, which was then an all-time high record.</p>
    <p>The cases dropped down slightly to 489 yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Most of the re­cent new cases have been linked to a prison in Kedah and to Sabah, which held a state elec­tion late last month.</p>
    <p>The two states ac­counted for 616 of the 691 cases re­ported on Tues­day, and 435 out of the 489 re­ported yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Prime Min­is­ter Muhyid­din Yassin on Tues­day pre­dicted that the num­ber of pos­i­tive cases will con­tinue to rise in the com­ing days, but he said that the gov­ern­ment is not con­sid­er­ing a move­ment con­trol or­der (MCO) be­cause of its im­pact on the liveli­hoods of 15 mil­lion Malaysians.</p>
    <p>The gov­ern­ment has gone for tar­geted lock­downs, clos­ing off most of Sabah ear­lier this week, lock­ing down the Kedah prison which was a cen­tre of a huge out­break, and also par­tially clos­ing down, from to­mor­row, the district of Klang in Se­lan­gor be­cause of the present clus­ters there.</p>
    <p>Tan Sri Muhyid­din has re­peat­edly said that the Malaysian econ­omy bled more than RM2 bil­lion (S$654,700) a day dur­ing the lock­down pe­riod and that the bank­ing and fi­nan­cial sys­tem had been close to col­laps­ing be­fore re­stric­tions were lifted in June.</p>
    <p>Bank Is­lam chief econ­o­mist Afzanizam Ab­dul Rashid told The Straits Times: “I think we have learnt that the first round of MCO had a dev­as­tat­ing im­pact on the econ­omy.</p>
    <p>“I think we have more clar­ity now com­pared to the first round of MCO where ev­ery­thing was un­prece­dented in many re­spects. In that sense, if the gov­ern­ment de­cides to be­come stricter with re­gard to hu­man mo­bil­ity, it’s go­ing to be very tar­geted and lo­calised.”</p>
    <p>Un­em­ploy­ment in Malaysia shot up from 3.3 per cent be­fore the pan­demic to 5.3 per cent in May, at the height of the lock­down.</p>
    <p>LO­CALISED AP­PROACH</p>
    <p>The num­ber of un­em­ployed per­sons went up from j ust over 500,000 to 826,000 in the span of three months.</p>
    <p>Malaysia’s gross do­mes­tic prod­uct fell 17.1 per cent dur­ing the sec­ond quar­ter of the year.</p>
    <p>Mr Muhyid­din had an­nounced a raft of mea­sures to pro­vide re­lief for Malaysians dur­ing the l ock­down.</p>
    <p>The key mea­sure was a six-month loan mora­to­rium which ended in Septem­ber. The ad­min­is­tra­tion has been re­sist­ing calls for a blan­ket ex­ten­sion of the mora­to­rium, in­stead al­low­ing banks to of­fer tar­geted ex­ten­sions to those with­out em­ploy­ment or strug­gling with their fi­nances.</p>
    <p>Pub­lic health ex­perts are also ad­vo­cat­ing a tar­geted ap­proach with­out a full lock­down.</p>
    <p>“A full-fledged MCO for the whole coun­try may not nec­es­sar­ily slow the spread of new cases as the cases are, for the moment, con­cen­trated in Kedah (Tem­bok clus­ter) and Sabah,” Univer­siti Malaya epi­demi­ol­o­gist Awang Bulgiba Awang Mah­mud told The Straits Times.</p>
    <p>“Be­cause of the high eco­nomic cost of MCO 2.0, I guess the gov­ern­ment will try its best not to ap­ply a full-fledged MCO and it will re­sort to Temco (tar­geted move­ment con­trol) where nec­es­sary. This is likely to con­tinue as long as com­mu­nity trans­mis­sion can still be mit­i­gated with ag­gres­sive con­tact trac­ing and iso­la­tion or quar­an­tine,” Pro­fes­sor Dr Awang said.</p>
    <p>How­ever, he warned that the win­dow of op­por­tu­nity to con­tain the spread is small and rapidly clos­ing.</p>
    <p>“We need to stop the in­fec­tion from spread­ing out­side the prison walls in Kedah, so an all-out ef­fort in con­tact trac­ing among prison staff and their con­tacts needs to be done there,” he said, point­ing out that the next few weeks will be cru­cial for the coun­try in deal­ing with the new wave.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, the chief of the Malaysian Pub­lic Health Physi­cians’ As­so­ci­a­tion, Dr Zainal Arif­fin Omar, said: “Even though the cases are high, these in­volve the prison and il­le­gal im­mi­grants. This should not be wor­ry­ing.”</p>
    <p>He pointed out that the high num­ber of cases in Sabah can be tack­led by ac­tive de­tec­tion and con­tact trac­ing, which helped the au­thor­i­ties con­tain a large clus­ter in Kedah ear­lier in the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>I think we have learnt that the first round of MCO had a dev­as­tat­ing im­pact on the econ­omy. I think we have more clar­ity now com­pared to the first round of MCO where ev­ery­thing was un­prece­dented in many re­spects. In that sense, if the gov­ern­ment de­cides to be­come stricter with re­gard to hu­man mo­bil­ity, it’s go­ing to be very tar­geted and lo­calised.</p>
