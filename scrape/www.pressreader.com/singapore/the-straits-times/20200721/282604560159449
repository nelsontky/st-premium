    <p>Aries</p>
    <p>(March 21 - April 19)</p>
    <p>You are feel­ing het up over some new per­son or plan that does not meet your stan­dards, but try not to make a big deal out of it.</p>
    <p>Taurus</p>
    <p>(April 20 - May 20)</p>
    <p>You are feel­ing just a wee bit over­con­fi­dent – that can be dan­ger­ous. Stay as hum­ble as you can be dur­ing this weird time.</p>
    <p>Gemini</p>
    <p>(May 21 - June 20)</p>
    <p>You are feel­ing more sure of your­self, which is ter­rific – but it could also lead to con­flict if you ex­press your­self too force­fully.</p>
    <p>Can­cer</p>
    <p>(June 21 - July 22)</p>
    <p>You are in the mood to strut your stuff and should find that your en­ergy is just right for mak­ing peo­ple see how great you are.</p>
    <p>Leo</p>
    <p>(July 23 - Aug 22)</p>
    <p>A surge of con­fi­dence wells up from deep within you. You may find it eas­ier to take care of your ro­man­tic needs or to get that pro­mo­tion.</p>
    <p>Virgo</p>
    <p>(Aug 23 - Sept 22)</p>
    <p>You are not feel­ing great about your odds. Your un­der­dog sta­tus may have you see­ing things dif­fer­ently, which can give you a se­ri­ous edge.</p>
    <p>Libra</p>
    <p>(Sept 23 - Oct 22)</p>
    <p>You should find that your mo­men­tum is pick­ing up in a good way, so re­lax and ride this wave as it takes you to some­thing bet­ter.</p>
    <p>Scorpio</p>
    <p>(Oct 23 - Nov 21)</p>
    <p>It is a good time for you to make sug­ges­tions you know the boss will not go for, if only to ce­ment your rep­u­ta­tion.</p>
    <p>Sagittariu­s</p>
    <p>(Nov 22 - Dec 21) Your cu­rios­ity about for­eign cul­tures is mak­ing life sweet and in­ter­est­ing – so get out there and soak up even more.</p>
    <p>Capricorn</p>
    <p>(Dec 22 - Jan 19)</p>
    <p>Your work­ing life is tak­ing a turn for the worse. Col­leagues or cus­tomers may try to take ad­van­tage of you, but this phase will not last long.</p>
    <p>Aquarius</p>
    <p>(Jan 20 - Feb 18)</p>
    <p>You value your in­de­pen­dence, It may cause some prob­lems as a fam­ily mem­ber needs you to stick by him more than you want.</p>
    <p>Pisces</p>
    <p>(Feb 19 - March 20)</p>
    <p>The boss is in a bad mood and you are best off leav­ing him alone. If he tries to pick a fight, just smile and go along with what­ever he says.</p>
