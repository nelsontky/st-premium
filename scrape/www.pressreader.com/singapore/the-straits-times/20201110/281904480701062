    <p>•</p>
    <p>LON­DON Only the peo­ple of the United States get to vote on who should be their pres­i­dent, but the en­tire world has a stake in their choice.</p>
    <p>And at no time was this truer than now, as world lead­ers rush to con­grat­u­late for­mer se­na­tor</p>
    <p>Joe Bi­den on win­ning the US pres­i­den­tial elec­tion. For the man Amer­i­cans have cho­sen to lead them un­til at least the mid­dle of this decade is bound to leave a pro­found im­print on the rest of the world; what­ever he does and – just as im­por­tantly – what­ever he chooses not to do will in one way or an­other shape the fate of bil­lions.</p>
    <p>In many re­spects, the Pres­i­dent-elect is an open book, a man whose ideas and ac­tions are well-known. Un­like Mr Barack Obama or Mr Don­ald Trump, his im­me­di­ate pre­de­ces­sors who walked into the White House with­out any gov­ern­ment ex­pe­ri­ence, Mr Bi­den has spent a life­time in pub­lic life, in­clud­ing decades as a se­na­tor where he con­cen­trated on for­eign pol­icy and se­cu­rity is­sues, as well as eight years as vice-pres­i­dent.</p>
    <p>Ar­guably, Amer­ica has not in­stalled a more ex­pe­ri­enced po­lit­i­cal op­er­a­tor since Lyn­don Johnson be­came pres­i­dent in the tragic af­ter­math of John F. Kennedy’s as­sas­si­na­tion back in 1963. There is a video clip or a sound record­ing of Mr Bi­den’s views on lit­er­ally any world cri­sis over the past half cen­tury.</p>
    <p>Yet at the same time, the Bi­den pres­i­dency re­mains a mys­tery. For af­ter a low-key cam­paign whose key mes­sage was, quite lit­er­ally, that Joe Bi­den is sim­ply not</p>
    <p>Don­ald Trump, we don’t ac­tu­ally know what to ex­pect from the man who, at the ad­vanced age of 78, has fi­nally achieved the dream of his life­time by be­com­ing pres­i­dent of the United States.</p>
    <p>The an­swer to this ques­tion will not come overnight; like all pre­vi­ous ad­min­is­tra­tions, the Bi­den pres­i­dency will ul­ti­mately be de­fined less by the choices it makes, and more by its in­stinc­tive re­sponse to un­fore­seen events.</p>
    <p>Yet even at this early stage, there are clear point­ers which can help us map out the tra­jec­tory of fu­ture US poli­cies.</p>
    <p>The first duty of those try­ing to pre­dict the char­ac­ter of the in­com­ing White House is not to fall into the clas­sic mis­takes for­eign­ers make about analysing the US. One such mis­take is to read too much into the re­sults of US elec­tions, or project other global trends on to the de­ci­sion of the Amer­i­can elec­torate.</p>
    <p>NOT THE END OF TRUMP­ISM</p>
    <p>Like it or not, the out­come of the elec­tion does not rep­re­sent the end of “Trump­ism”, or of far-right pop­ulist causes. Mr Trump may have lost his re-elec­tion bid, but the num­ber of votes for him was sub­stan­tially up on the 2016 elec­tion; more than 47 per cent of those who voted in the lat­est elec­tion opted for Mr Trump and, with over 70 mil­lion votes,</p>
    <p>“The Don­ald” has achieved the high­est score of any sit­ting Amer­i­can pres­i­dent, ever.</p>
    <p>None of this was enough for him to win a sec­ond term, but it hardly amounts to a re­pu­di­a­tion of Mr Trump’s pri­or­i­ties. So, the age of grumpy pol­i­tics, of Amer­i­can lead­ers who re­ject glob­al­i­sa­tion, dis­trust free trade and be­lieve that the US is be­ing taken ad­van­tage of by both al­lies and en­e­mies, is far from over, and won’t be over un­less the Democrats now com­ing to power find a way of en­gag­ing not only with their nat­u­ral ur­ban lib­eral con­stituency, but also with their ru­ral com­mu­ni­ties. In­deed, in many re­spects, the lat­est elec­tion merely con­firmed Amer­ica’s po­lar­i­sa­tion.</p>
    <p>Yet prob­a­bly the big­gest er­ror we can make is to as­sume that the in­com­ing pres­i­dency is just aching to get go­ing on for­eign pol­icy ini­tia­tives. For Mr Bi­den’s pri­or­ity is to han­dle the clin­i­cal and eco­nomic im­pact of the coro­n­avirus pan­demic, and to try and heal the deep di­vides in Amer­i­can so­ci­ety. Some­one who has spent most of his life in the cor­ri­dors of power in Wash­ing­ton needs no re­mind­ing of the adage that all US pol­i­tics is do­mes­tic.</p>
    <p>Still, the changes in Amer­ica’s for­eign pol­icy will be no­tice­able. The Bi­den ad­min­is­tra­tion be­lieves that Amer­ica has much to gain and noth­ing to fear from its mem­ber­ship in in­ter­na­tional in­sti­tu­tions. So Mr Trump’s de­ci­sions to leave the World Health Or­gan­i­sa­tion, aban­don mul­ti­lat­eral trade plat­forms and dis­par­age or­gan­i­sa­tions such as Nato – the US-led mil­i­tary al­liance in Europe – will be re­versed.</p>
    <p>Gone too will be the man­age­ment of Amer­ica’s for­eign pol­icy through tweets writ­ten in cap­i­tal let­ters and dis­patched in the early hours of the morn­ing. Nor would any­one have to worry about a US pres­i­dent throw­ing tem­per tantrums at in­ter­na­tional sum­mits.</p>
    <p>And there are other clear com­mit­ments Mr Bi­den has made, such as re­in­stat­ing the nu­clear deal with Iran and re­turn­ing the US to the Paris Agree­ment on cli­mate change. “We have to sal­vage our rep­u­ta­tion, re­build con­fi­dence in our lead­er­ship, and mo­bilise our coun­try,” Mr Bi­den ex­plained in the only co­her­ent for­eign pol­icy man­i­festo he pub­lished back in March.</p>
    <p>But while all this in­di­cates a re­turn to a more pre­dictable Amer­ica, it is a fal­lacy to as­sume that what we are about to ex­pe­ri­ence is a whole­sale restora­tion of old cer­tain­ties.</p>
    <p>CHINA RE­LA­TIONS</p>
    <p>China is a per­fect ex­am­ple of this. The fact that Mr Bi­den once called Pres­i­dent Xi Jin­ping “a thug” is not very sig­nif­i­cant; we should not forget that China was sup­posed to be a key is­sue dur­ing the elec­toral cam­paign, and the Demo­crat chal­lenger had to sound tough.</p>
    <p>Be­yond that, the re­al­ity is that Mr Bi­den does not con­sider Mr Trump’s pub­lic con­fronta­tion with China as ei­ther clever or use­ful.</p>
    <p>Still, the chal­lenge from China to Amer­ica’s global stand­ing and to Wash­ing­ton’s sys­tem of global al­liances is sus­tained and ir­re­versible. The Bi­den ad­min­is­tra­tion will cer­tainly be more so­phis­ti­cated and less overtly con­fronta­tional, but para­dox­i­cally that will be more of a chal­lenge to China.</p>
    <p>Ms Michele Flournoy, who was un­der­sec­re­tary of de­fence for pol­icy in the Obama ad­min­is­tra­tion and slated to be­come Mr Bi­den’s de­fence sec­re­tary, ex­e­cuted Mr Obama’s “pivot to Asia” and is guar­an­teed to be very re­source­ful in har­ness­ing the ca­pa­bil­i­ties of Amer­ica’s Asia’s al­lies. Wash­ing­ton’s ob­jec­tives won’t change: to slow down</p>
    <p>China’s abil­ity to match Amer­ica’s mil­i­tary ca­pa­bil­i­ties, to re­spond to China’s ex­pand­ing nu­clear arse­nal and to re­buff what are seen as Bei­jing’s ef­forts to knock the US off its perch as Asia’s pre-em­i­nent power.</p>
    <p>Much has been said about the pos­si­bil­i­ties of a change in the US re­la­tion­ship with In­dia. But the ba­sic fact re­mains that what­ever reser­va­tions Mr Bi­den may have about Prime Min­is­ter Naren­dra Modi, In­dia will con­tinue to be viewed in Wash­ing­ton through the prism of Amer­ica’s re­la­tions with China, so con­ti­nu­ity rather than change is very much on the cards.</p>
    <p>Poli­cies to­wards Rus­sia won’t change much ei­ther: Mr Bi­den is bound by the rhetoric of the past few years into a pol­icy of eco­nomic sanc­tions against Rus­sia which won’t be re­laxed.</p>
    <p>EURO­PEAN AL­LIES</p>
    <p>Then there are the Euro­peans, Amer­ica’s clos­est al­lies, all of whom are ea­gerly wait­ing for the ar­rival of a new pres­i­dent. Mr Bi­den’s elec­tion is bad news for Bri­tish Prime Min­is­ter Boris Johnson, not be­cause Mr Johnson was a fan of Mr Trump – he was not – but more be­cause the poli­cies which Bri­tain is pur­su­ing are re­garded as fool­ish by the in­com­ing US ad­min­is­tra­tion.</p>
    <p>Mr Bi­den is on record as dis­miss­ing Bri­tain’s de­ci­sion to leave the Euro­pean Union as a big strate­gic er­ror, and the Pres­i­dent-elect has also warned the gov­ern­ment in Lon­don against vi­o­lat­ing in­ter­na­tional treaties de­signed to en­sure that the bor­der be­tween North­ern Ire­land, which is part of the United King­dom, and the rest of the is­land of Ire­land, which re­mains in the EU, will con­tinue to be open.</p>
    <p>A Bi­den ad­min­is­tra­tion is, there­fore, much more likely to place the em­pha­sis in Europe on the Euro­pean Union’s two lead­ing na­tions – Ger­many and France .</p>
    <p>But here again, re­al­i­ties may quickly sink in. For although Ger­many is guar­an­teed to em­brace Mr Bi­den with open arms, the Ger­mans have a long track record of not de­liv­er­ing on the ap­pro­pri­ate se­cu­rity con­tri­bu­tions which the Amer­i­cans ex­pect from Europe’s sin­gle big­gest power.</p>
    <p>Ex­pect the Bri­tish to make sure that they de­liver where Ger­many or France will not, in the hope of re­gain­ing their favoured po­si­tion with the new ad­min­is­tra­tion.</p>
    <p>THE MID­DLE EAST</p>
    <p>And there is also the Mid­dle East, where re­al­i­ties will dic­tate out­comes. Although Mr Bi­den did not sup­port Mr Trump’s recog­ni­tion of Jerusalem as Is­rael’s cap­i­tal, it is al­most in­con­ceiv­able that a new ad­min­is­tra­tion will or­der the move of the US em­bassy from Jerusalem back to Tel Aviv.</p>
    <p>Nor is Mr Bi­den likely to deny sup­port for the nor­mal­i­sa­tion of diplo­matic re­la­tions be­tween the monar­chies of the Gulf and the Jewish state. And although the in­com­ing pres­i­dent has deep mis­giv­ings about Saudi Ara­bia, he will be quickly re­minded by his of­fi­cials that Saudi money and in­flu­ence in the Mid­dle East are best har­nessed in favour of Amer­i­can ob­jec­tives.</p>
    <p>The sig­na­ture theme of the</p>
    <p>Bi­den pres­i­dency – the re­in­state­ment of the nu­clear deal with Iran – is un­likely to prove as straight­for­ward as it cur­rently stands. For what Mr Bi­den wants is for Iran to make con­ces­sions by re­turn­ing to com­pli­ance with the pro­vi­sions of that agree­ment in re­turn for the US restor­ing its in­volve­ment, while the Ira­ni­ans in­sist that the US should re­turn to the agree­ment first, with­out de­mand­ing any con­ces­sions.</p>
    <p>Mr Bi­den is also pledged to en­gage in fur­ther ne­go­ti­a­tions with Iran to limit its ef­forts to desta­bilise other coun­tries in the Mid­dle East. But the chances of the Ira­ni­ans en­gag­ing in th­ese sorts of ne­go­ti­a­tions are very slim in­deed.</p>
    <p>Be­sides, it is not ob­vi­ous that the US Se­nate – which looks likely to re­main un­der the con­trol of Repub­li­cans – will ac­cept th­ese moves. And the Bi­den ad­min­is­tra­tion will have to strug­gle to re­move the en­tire web of eco­nomic sanc­tions on Iran, es­pe­cially since the Ira­ni­ans will ex­pect this to hap­pen be­fore, rather than af­ter, Te­heran it­self of­fers any con­ces­sions.</p>
    <p>Add to this the pres­sure which both Is­rael and many Arab states are likely to ex­ert on Wash­ing­ton, and it is clear that Mr Bi­den’s pledge to re-en­gage with Iran has all the at­trac­tion of sim­plic­ity with none of the prom­ise of suc­cess.</p>
    <p>Be that as it may, the US is back on the global stage, led by an ad­min­is­tra­tion which claims to be will­ing to “lead again”, as Mr Bi­den put it.</p>
    <p>So, at long last, the world can go back to crit­i­cis­ing Amer­i­can lead­er­ship, rather than be­moan­ing the lack of it.</p>
