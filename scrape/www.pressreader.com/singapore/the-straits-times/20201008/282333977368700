    <p>An­gela Lee be­lieves be­com­ing a mother will give her a “higher pur­pose” when she even­tu­ally re­turns to the cage, the mixed mar­tial arts (MMA) star told The Straits Times yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The 24-year-old One Cham­pi­onship atom­weight world cham­pion had, to­gether with hus­band and fel­low One fighter Bruno Pucci, an­nounced on so­cial me­dia last Thurs­day that she was 11 weeks preg­nant with her first child.</p>
    <p>The couple, who tied the knot in July 2018 and are based in Hawaii, will wel­come the baby next April.</p>
    <p>Lee, how­ever, does not ex­pect to be out of ac­tion for too long.</p>
    <p>She said over a Zoom call: “I’ve told my fam­ily and Cha­tri (Si­ty­o­d­tong, One chief ex­ec­u­tive) that af­ter I give birth in April, I’ll start train­ing as soon as pos­si­ble, and get back in the cage be­fore the end of the year.</p>
    <p>“That’s my goal for next year, we’ll see how ev­ery­thing goes… I’ll be 25 then, that’s still quite young for our sport, and I still love MMA and what I do.”</p>
    <p>When asked if moth­er­hood will make her a stronger fighter, she said: “I would think so. I can’t re­ally speak about it yet be­cause I haven’t had the baby, so I don’t know ex­actly how it will change my men­tal and emo­tional state of mind.</p>
    <p>“But I do be­lieve the baby will give me a higher pur­pose, and that I will fight not just for wins or belts or for legacy. I’m ex­cited to be fight­ing for the lit­tle one.”</p>
    <p>There are MMA fight­ers who have re­turned to ac­tion af­ter their preg­nan­cies, such as Ul­ti­mate Fight­ing Cham­pi­onship duo Macken­zie Dern and Michelle Water­son.</p>
    <p>Lee said she has been a “big fol</p>
    <p>PARENTAL DRIVE</p>
    <p>lower” of their jour­neys, and said: “I have huge re­spect for them and I can­not wait to be on the list among them as mum fight­ers and as a mum cham­pion too.”</p>
    <p>The Cana­dian, who has a Sin­ga­porean father and South Korean mother, fights un­der the Sin­ga­pore flag. She was slated to de­fend her ti­tle against Denice Zam­boanga this month – the Filip­ina yes­ter­day blasted Lee on In­sta­gram for not va­cat­ing her ti­tle – but her pregnancy has changed those plans.</p>
    <p>Her last fight was in Oc­to­ber last year when she re­tained her ti­tle against Xiong Jing­nan at the One: Cen­tury event in Tokyo.</p>
    <p>With Lee out of ac­tion, One Cham­pi­onship has an­nounced an atom­weight Grand Prix tour­na­ment will kick off in Jan­uary, with the win­ner earn­ing a shot at the belt upon her re­turn.</p>
    <p>For now, Lee is happy to fo­cus on her baby, whose gen­der is not re­vealed yet.</p>
    <p>The joy in her voice was clear when she re­counted how she broke the news to her fam­ily with fake scratch lot­tery tick­ets which said “we’re hav­ing a baby”, and groaned as she talked about be­ing hit with “pretty bad” morn­ing sick­ness.</p>
    <p>“I call it all-day sick­ness,” she joked.</p>
    <p>No doubt, Lee and Pucci’s child will grow up around mar­tial arts – they run their own jiu-jitsu gym and their fam­ily owns an MMA gym.</p>
    <p>So would they give their back­ing if their child were to ex­press an in­ter­est i n pur­su­ing a ca­reer MMA?</p>
    <p>“Bruno and I have talked about this many times, about how we want to raise our chil­dren and give them all the op­por­tu­ni­ties and op­tions to choose what­ever they want to pur­sue,” Lee said.</p>
    <p>“We’re not go­ing to force them to take a cer­tain path… (but) mar­tial arts in­stil amaz­ing val­ues in young chil­dren, and if they choose the path of pro fight­ing, with both of us hav­ing ex­per­tise in it, they will have the sup­port from us, 100 per cent.” in</p>
    <p>I do be­lieve the baby will give me a higher pur­pose, and that I will fight not just for wins or belts or for legacy.</p>
