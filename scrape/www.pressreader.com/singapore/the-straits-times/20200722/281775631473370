    <p>WASH­ING­TON • Florida has be­come the epi­cen­tre of the lat­est coro­n­avirus surge in the United States as new cases con­tin­ued to soar, while Cal­i­for­nia, an­other hot spot, started to see im­prove­ment with cases of in­fec­tions and hos­pi­tal­i­sa­tions sta­bil­is­ing.</p>
    <p>The coro­n­avirus pan­demic con­tin­ued rag­ing in Florida on Mon­day as the south­ern state re­ported more than 10,000 new in­fec­tions for a sixth day in a row, prompt­ing its teach­ers union to sue Repub­li­can Gov­er­nor Ron DeSan­tis over his plan to re­open schools for in­class in­struc­tion.</p>
    <p>An­other 92 people have died in</p>
    <p>Florida, raising the state’s death toll to 5,183.</p>
    <p>Mr DeSan­tis, who has been sharply crit­i­cised for his han­dling of the cri­sis, said over the week­end that pos­i­tiv­ity rates and Covid-19-re­lated emergency room vis­its have been trend­ing lower in re­cent weeks.</p>
    <p>In Cal­i­for­nia, which emerged as an­other coro­n­avirus hot spot in July, Gov­er­nor Gavin New­som said new in­fec­tions, hos­pi­tal­i­sa­tions and in­ten­sive-care unit ad­mis­sions were all still ris­ing in the na­tion’s most pop­u­lous state but not nearly at the pace of re­cent weeks.</p>
    <p>“We are see­ing a re­duc­tion in the rate of growth but a rate of growth none­the­less,” Mr New­som, a Demo­crat, said at a brief­ing in the state cap­i­tal Sacra­mento.</p>
    <p>“Hos­pi­tal­i­sa­tions and ICU (ad­mis­sions) con­tinue to be cause of con­cern in this state. That’s why we want ev­ery­body to double down on what we’ve been do­ing,” he said.</p>
    <p>Teams from the Fed­eral Emergency Man­age­ment Agency ar­rived to pitch in at strapped South­ern Cal­i­for­nia hos­pi­tals.</p>
    <p>“We were re­ally pushed up last week to our lim­its. If we had con­tin­ued to see ac­cel­er­at­ing num­ber of cases com­ing into the hos­pi­tal, something would have to give,” said Dr Al­lan Wil­liamson, the chief med­i­cal of­fi­cer at Eisenhower Med­i­cal Cen­tre in Ran­cho Mi­rage, east of Los An­ge­les.</p>
    <p>“So for­tu­nately, the fed­eral govern­ment, through the De­part­ment of De­fence was able to step in and pro­vide us some ad­di­tional staffing, which has re­ally helped us a lot,” Dr Wil­liamson said.</p>
    <p>Sep­a­rately, Los An­ge­les Mayor Eric Garcetti has more than once threat­ened to im­pose a new “stayat-home” or­der in Amer­ica’s sec­ond-largest city if trends were not re­versed.</p>
    <p>New York, which has recorded 32,000 deaths, far more than any other state in the US, recorded eight fa­tal­i­ties on Sun­day.</p>
    <p>The to­tal num­ber of people hos­pi­talised in New York state for the dis­ease fell to 716, the fewest since March 18, Gov­er­nor An­drew Cuomo, a Demo­crat, said. Re­stric­tions were eased slightly, with zoos and the Statue of Lib­erty re­open­ing as well as pro­fes­sional sports but with­out fans.</p>
    <p>Chicago Mayor Lori Light­foot, also a Demo­crat, im­posed new clam­p­downs, in­clud­ing a ban on in­door ser­vice at bars and shut­down of per­sonal ser­vices such as shaves and fa­cials that re­quire the re­moval of masks. “While we aren’t near the peak of the pan­demic from ear­lier this year, none of us wants to go back there,” Ms Light­foot said.</p>
    <p>Met­rics na­tion­wide show a con­tin­ued surge in the pan­demic, with 32 states re­port­ing record in­creases in Covid-19 cases in July and 15 states re­port­ing record in­creases in deaths. The pan­demic has killed more than 140,000 people in the US and in­fected some 3.9 mil­lion, both fig­ures lead­ing the world.</p>
    <p>Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump, who had pushed back on mask re­quire­ments by state and local of­fi­cials, on Mon­day posted a black and white photo of him­self wear­ing one on Twitter.</p>
    <p>“We are United in our ef­fort to de­feat the In­vis­i­ble China Virus, and many people say that it is Pa­tri­otic to wear a face mask when you can’t so­cially dis­tance. There is no­body more Pa­tri­otic than me, your fa­vorite Pres­i­dent!” Mr Trump said in a tweet.</p>
    <p>He also said he would re­sume hold­ing regular Covid-19 news brief­ings yes­ter­day af­ter stop­ping them in April.</p>
