    <p>Face­book an­nounced in May that up to half its work­force is likely to be work­ing from home within the next five to 10 years. There is one caveat: Staff salaries could be ad­justed to align with the cost of liv­ing in their cho­sen lo­ca­tion, mean­ing po­ten­tial pay cuts for those con­sid­er­ing mov­ing away from its ex­pen­sive Palo Alto base and other global hubs.</p>
    <p>Chief ex­ec­u­tive Mark Zucker­berg told staff via video that the change will come into ef­fect from Jan­uary.</p>
    <p>“We’ll ad­just salary to your lo­ca­tion at that point... There’ll be se­vere ram­i­fi­ca­tions for peo­ple who are not hon­est about this,” he added.</p>
    <p>Work­place mes­sag­ing com­pany Slack has an­nounced a sim­i­lar move, while fel­low Cal­i­for­nia-based Twit­ter and mo­bile pay­ments com­pany Square have yet to con­firm whether they will fol­low Face­book’s lead – but has the so­cial me­dia plat­form set a wider prece­dent for the sec­tor as com­pa­nies look to cut costs?</p>
    <p>It is “treach­er­ous ground if you pay peo­ple less be­cause they live some­where that costs less”, says Dr Thomas Kochan, pro­fes­sor of work and or­gan­i­sa­tion stud­ies at MIT’s Sloane School of Man­age­ment and co-di­rec­tor of the Sloan In­sti­tute for Work and Em­ploy­ment Re­search.</p>
    <p>Ms Laura Bald­win, pres­i­dent of O’Reilly, a US tech­nol­ogy text­book pub­lisher, agrees. “If you ex­pect sim­i­lar re­sults and out­comes from every­one on your engi­neer­ing team, for ex­am­ple, how can you pay one engi­neer less than the other for the same value of work?” she says.</p>
    <p>“Does it mat­ter if your team lives in Cal­i­for­nia or Utah if they are ex­pected to de­liver sim­i­lar re­sults?”</p>
    <p>Salaries can vary sig­nif­i­cantly across the United States. Ac­cord­ing to cen­sus data, the me­dian house­hold in­come in Cal­i­for­nia in 2018 was an es­ti­mated US$75,000 (S$104,000), com­pared with US$58,700 in neigh­bour­ing</p>
    <p>Ne­vada and US$54,500 in the Mid­west state of Mis­souri. Within Cal­i­for­nia, San Fran­cisco’s me­dian was US$107,900 com­pared with US$72,600 in Los An­ge­les.</p>
    <p>Face­book – which em­ploys nearly 50,000 full-time em­ploy­ees world­wide – sug­gests the move is sim­ply an ex­ten­sion of cur­rent prac­tice. “We have al­ways used a mar­ket-based ap­proach to com­pen­sa­tion, mean­ing that we pay in line with the com­mon mar­ket prac­tice in each lo­ca­tion where we op­er­ate. This is our cur­rent prac­tice, and has been for years. It ap­plies to all work­ers, in­clud­ing re­mote work­ers,” a Face­book spokesman says.</p>
    <p>Yet it is dif­fi­cult to pre­dict how much money such a move will save for the likes of Face­book, which is fac­ing an ad­ver­tis­ing boy­cott from some of the world’s big­gest com­pa­nies af­ter be­ing ac­cused of fail­ing to take mean­ing­ful ac­tion over mis­in­for­ma­tion pub­lished on its site.</p>
    <p>More peo­ple work­ing from home across var­i­ous re­gions will cre­ate a big­ger tal­ent pool, says Dr Sameer Hasija, as­so­ci­ate pro­fes­sor of tech­nol­ogy and op­er­a­tions man­age­ment at Insead, the French busi­ness school. But sim­i­larly, he ar­gues, “em­ploy­ees will have ac­cess to more em­ploy­ers, so it de­pends how the sup­ply and de­mand mar­ket plays out”.</p>
    <p>Busi­nesses also can­not fore­see fac­tors such as pos­si­ble reg­u­la­tory changes in re­sponse to more peo­ple work­ing from home in the long term, says Dr Ian Wood­ward, pro­fes­sor of man­age­ment prac­tice at Insead’s Asia cam­pus. Any­one con­sid­ered to be top tal­ent will have in­creased salary bar­gain­ing power, he adds, mak­ing it “very hard” to as­cer­tain what sav­ings com­pa­nies could make.</p>
    <p>Em­ploy­ers could reach out to those who would oth­er­wise strug­gle to af­ford to live near a com­pany’s head­quar­ters, such as ju­nior can­di­dates or those who can­not re­lo­cate due to fam­ily com­mit­ments, says Mr Charles Cot­ton, se­nior pol­icy ad­viser for per­for­mance and re­ward at the Bri­tish-based Char­tered In­sti­tute of Per­son­nel and De­vel­op­ment.</p>
    <p>“It also de­pends on how the gov­ern­ment rolls out in­fra­struc­ture. Oth­er­wise there will be groups of peo­ple de­prived from ac­cess­ing the labour mar­ket,” he adds.</p>
    <p>But Ms Jon­quil Hack­en­berg, global head of sus­tain­able busi­ness at In­fosys Con­sult­ing, coun­ters that while re­mote work­ing “gives busi­nesses the abil­ity to hire top tal­ent from any­where... bas­ing pay on lo­ca­tion un­der­mines this en­tirely – and could un­der­mine wider ef­forts to reach pay equal­ity”.</p>
    <p>In a sur­vey last month of more than 7,000 Bri­tons by Pi­plsay, a re­search com­pany, half of re­spon­dents said they thought Face­book’s de­ci­sion to ad­just salary by lo­ca­tion was fair and that the em­ployer could also ben­e­fit; one-third be­lieved it was un­fair and that it would dis­cour­age peo­ple from opt­ing for it.</p>
    <p>There is also the ques­tion of what ef­fect a mass work­ing from home pol­icy could have on large, mul­ti­cul­tural and of­ten ex­pen­sive cities such as Lon­don or New York and tech­nol­ogy hubs like Sil­i­con Val­ley. Would the lure of home work­ing, even if it does mean a pay cut, lead to a mass ex­o­dus?</p>
    <p>That is not yet clear, says Dr Lynda Grat­ton, pro­fes­sor of man­age­ment prac­tice at Lon­don Busi­ness School. She be­lieves it is most likely that many peo­ple will work from home some of the time, rather than most of the time.</p>
    <p>Offices will be “places for so­cial­is­ing, cre­at­ing serendip­i­tous en­coun­ters and gen­eral flanerie”, she says, while home will be a place for more in­ten­sive, fo­cused work.</p>
    <p>Such a shift will raise im­por­tant ques­tions about what offices – and in­deed cities – are for, she adds.</p>
