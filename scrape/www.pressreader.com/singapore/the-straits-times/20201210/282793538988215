    <p>LOS AN­GE­LES • Next year’s pan­demic-hit Os­cars will be pro­duced by Con­ta­gion (2011) di­rec­tor Steven Soder­bergh, the Academy of Mo­tion Pic­ture Arts and Sciences an­nounced on Tues­day, as Hol­ly­wood’s big­gest night fi­nally be­gins to take shape.</p>
    <p>The cer­e­mony set to take place on April 25 has been post­poned due to the coro­n­avirus and seen its film el­i­gi­bil­ity rules re­laxed due to the lack of open cin­e­mas, while its for­mat still re­mains un­clear.</p>
    <p>But the Los An­ge­les-based academy on Tues­day un­veiled “a dream team who will re­spond di­rectly to these times” in cre­at­ing the show.</p>
    <p>“The up­com­ing Os­cars is the per­fect oc­ca­sion for in­no­va­tion and for re-en­vi­sion­ing the pos­si­bil­i­ties for the awards show,” said pres­i­dent David Ru­bin and chief ex­ec­u­tive Dawn Hud­son in a state­ment.</p>
    <p>Soder­bergh, 57, who won a Best Di­rec­tor Os­car for Traf­fic (2000), will be joined in plan­ning the cer­e­mony by former Grammy Awards pro­ducer Jesse Collins and film pro­ducer Stacey Sher.</p>
    <p>He and Sher had worked to­gether on Erin Brock­ovich (2000) as well as Con­ta­gion, which was praised at the out­break of the coro­n­avirus pan­demic for its eerie pre­science.</p>
    <p>With most of Cal­i­for­nia in­clud­ing Los An­ge­les un­der a new lock­down due to Covid-19, or­gan­is­ers have yet to de­cide whether the 93rd Os­cars will take place in-per­son, em­u­late tele­vi­sion’s Em­mys which took place “virtually” in Septem­ber, or opt for some com­bi­na­tion of the two.</p>
    <p>The cer­e­mony has been post­poned by eight weeks, with the cut­off date for el­i­gi­ble films ex­tended by two months to end-Fe­bru­ary. The academy, seen as the apex body of Hol­ly­wood’s film in­dus­try, also eased el­i­gi­bil­ity rules to let movies that skip the big screen and ap­pear on stream­ing plat­forms con­tend for Os­cars.</p>
