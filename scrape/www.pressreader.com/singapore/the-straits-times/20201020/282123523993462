    <p>A Malaysian drug run­ner was spared the gal­lows a se­cond time af­ter a five-judge Court of Ap­peal re­versed a 2018 de­ci­sion to con­vict him on a cap­i­tal charge, in what it called an ex­cep­tional case yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Gobi Ave­dian, 32, was in­stead given 15 years’ jail and 10 strokes of the cane, the orig­i­nal sen­tence meted out by the High Court in 2017.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day’s de­ci­sion was based on a change in le­gal po­si­tion in a 2019 case in­volv­ing Nige­rian Adili Chibuike Ejike, who was spared the gal­lows upon ap­peal be­cause he was found not to know of the pres­ence of the drugs.</p>
    <p>The apex court had ruled then that the le­gal con­cepts of ac­tual knowl­edge and wil­ful blind­ness were “sep­a­rate and dis­tinct”.</p>
    <p>Wil­ful blind­ness is a le­gal term for the men­tal state of a per­son who sus­pects the truth but de­lib­er­ately re­fuses to in­ves­ti­gate fur­ther.</p>
    <p>Gobi was orig­i­nally charged with the i mpor­ta­tion of 40.22g of heroin, af­ter he was caught at Wood­lands Check­point on Dec 11, 2014.</p>
    <p>The former se­cu­rity guard said he turned to trans­port­ing drugs be­cause he needed money to pay for his daugh­ter’s med­i­cal fees.</p>
    <p>He first avoided the death penalty in 2017 af­ter a High Court judge ac­cepted his ac­count that he be­lieved he was car­ry­ing “disco drugs” mixed with choco­late, rather than heroin.</p>
    <p>Jus­tice Lee Seiu Kin in­stead con­victed Gobi on a re­duced charge of at­tempted im­por­ta­tion of a Class C drug, and sen­tenced him to 15 years’ jail and 10 strokes of the cane.</p>
    <p>The pros­e­cu­tion then ap­pealed, push­ing for the orig­i­nal cap­i­tal charge.</p>
    <p>In 2018, a three-judge apex court al­lowed the ap­peal and handed down the death penalty, rul­ing that Gobi had failed to re­but the statu­tory pre­sump­tion of knowl­edge of the na­ture of the drugs he car­ried.</p>
    <p>In 2019, in the Adili case, the Court of Ap­peal held that the doc­trine of wil­ful blind­ness is not rel­e­vant in con­sid­er­ing whether the pre­sump­tion of pos­ses­sion un­der the Mis­use of Drugs Act (MDA) has been re­but­ted.</p>
    <p>In Fe­bru­ary this year, Gobi filed an ap­pli­ca­tion for the court to re­view its de­ci­sion in 2018 to con­vict him on the cap­i­tal charge.</p>
    <p>His lawyer M. Ravi ques­tioned the cor­rect­ness of that de­ci­sion, in the light of the de­ci­sion in Adili’s case. He ar­gued that the rul­ing in Adili’s case should be ex­tended to the pre­sump­tion of knowl­edge.</p>
    <p>He ar­gued that since the pros­e­cu­tion’s case against Gobi at the trial was one of wil­ful blind­ness, the pros­e­cu­tion could not have i nvoked the pre­sump­tion in the first place. But the pros­e­cu­tion main­tained that its case was premised on ac­tual knowl­edge.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, the court, led by Chief Jus­tice Sun­daresh Menon, ac­cepted that Gobi’s case should be re­opened. “There are le­gal ar­gu­ments based on the changes in the law that arose from our de­ci­sion in Adili on which we may con­clude that there has been a mis­car­riage of jus­tice... if our de­ci­sion on con­vic­tion in that ap­peal is re­con­sid­ered in the light of those changes in the law,” said the court.</p>
    <p>It held that the knowl­edge that is pre­sumed un­der the MDA is con­fined to ac­tual knowl­edge and wil­fully blind­ness is ir­rel­e­vant to whether the pre­sump­tion has been re­but­ted.</p>
    <p>The court found that the pros­e­cu­tion had changed its case, from one of wil­ful blind­ness at the trial, to one of ac­tual knowl­edge on ap­peal, which was prej­u­di­cial to Gobi. It held that Gobi’s fail­ure to re­but the pre­sump­tion of knowl­edge could no longer form the ba­sis of his con­vic­tion on the cap­i­tal charge. It also found that he was not wil­fully blind to the na­ture of the drugs.</p>
    <p>The court noted that he had made cer­tain in­quiries into the na­ture of the drugs but was as­sured that the drugs were “not serious”.</p>
    <p>It set aside his con­vic­tion on the cap­i­tal charge and re­in­stated his ini­tial con­vic­tion by the High Court.</p>
    <p>The court was faced with two op­tions: to con­vict Gobi of at­tempt­ing to im­port a drug that falls into a cat­e­gory that does not at­tract the death penalty, or to not con­vict him of any charge at all. “In our judg­ment, the former op­tion ought to be taken, given that the ap­pli­cant has, on his own de­fence, ad­mit­ted to en­gag­ing in some form of ac­tiv­ity that would, at the min­i­mum, in­volve im­port­ing a Class C drug.”</p>
