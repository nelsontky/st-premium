    <p>The Min­istry of So­cial and Fam­ily De­vel­op­ment (MSF) funds three tran­si­tional shel­ters for the home­less, but it does not fund the Safe Sound Sleep­ing Places.</p>
    <p>There are 29 Safe Sound Sleep­ing Places now, which are mostly re­li­gious groups such as churches and tem­ples of­fer­ing its premises for peo­ple seek­ing shel­ter for the night.</p>
    <p>The MSF spokesman said: “Safe Sound Sleep­ing Places are ground-up ini­tia­tives that were set up with the good­will of our com­mu­nity part­ners us­ing their own re­sources.”</p>
    <p>The spokesman noted that the min­istry funds three shel­ters, which are run by AMKFSC Com­mu­nity Ser­vices, Awwa and New Hope Com­mu­nity Ser­vices.</p>
    <p>The Cri­sis Cen­tre (Sin­ga­pore) shut its two shel­ters for the home­less at the end of last month af­ter it ran out of funds.</p>
    <p>The Com­mis­sioner of Char­i­ties had barred the char­ity from fund-rais­ing since Au­gust last year over se­ri­ous gov­er­nance con­cerns.</p>
    <p>The MSF has also lodged a po­lice re­port against the Cri­sis Cen­tre over sus­pected crim­i­nal mis­con­duct.</p>
    <p>The MSF said that while it does not fund the Safe Sound Sleep­ing Places, it helps to co­or­di­nate ef­forts of its part­ners in the Part­ners En­gag­ing and Em­pow­er­ing Rough Sleep­ers (Peers) Net­work to help the home­less, by link­ing them up with po­ten­tial sources of fund­ing, among other things.</p>
    <p>The MSF told The Straits Times last month that there was suf­fi­cient space in shel­ters for the home­less, even with the surge of peo­ple seek­ing refuge dur­ing the Covid-19 cri­sis.</p>
