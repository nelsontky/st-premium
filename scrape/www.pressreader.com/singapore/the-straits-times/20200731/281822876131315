    <p>Malaysia’s largest party, Umno, has in­sisted it will not be a mem­ber of Prime Min­is­ter Muhyid­din Yassin’s Perikatan Na­sional (PN) al­liance de­spite be­ing a part of his govern­ment, and will in­stead fo­cus on the Malay-Mus­lim pact it has with Parti Is­lam SeMalaysia (PAS).</p>
    <p>This comes just two days after Umno for­mer premier Na­jib Razak was con­victed on seven counts of graft re­lated to the 1Malaysia De­vel­op­ment Ber­had (1MDB) scan­dal.</p>
    <p>The con­vic­tion has raised con­cerns over the sta­bil­ity of the govern­ment, as Na­jib re­mains widely in­flu­en­tial in Umno, which sup­plies the most MPs to the Muhyid­din ad­min­is­tra­tion. Umno pres­i­dent Zahid Hamidi said yes­ter­day that the party has de­cided “not to join PN, but in­stead em­power Muafakat Na­sional (MN) with PAS and Barisan Na­sional (BN) com­po­nents”.</p>
    <p>BN is the long-rul­ing mul­tira­cial coali­tion led by Umno that was shock­ingly ousted in the 2018 gen­eral elec­tion.</p>
    <p>Zahid, him­self fac­ing a raft of cor­rup­tion charges, said “our sup­port to PN gov­ern­ments is only via the BN law­mak­ers in the fed­eral govern­ment and sev­eral state gov­ern­ments”.</p>
    <p>He also re­vealed that Tan Sri Muhyid­din had said his Parti Pribumi Ber­satu Malaysia in­tends to join MN dur­ing a meet­ing with BN par­lia­men­tar­i­ans on Wednes­day.</p>
    <p>Although Ber­satu’s en­try into MN must be dis­cussed with PAS, it sig­nalled a con­ces­sion from Mr Muhyid­din after Tues­day’s High Court guilty ver­dicts against Na­jib an­gered a large seg­ment of Umno sup­port­ers.</p>
    <p>“The re­al­ity after the Na­jib ver­dict back­lash is that Muhyid­din needs the back­ing of Umno and PAS,” an Umno leader told The Straits Times.</p>
    <p>But PN sources dis­closed that the Prime Min­is­ter has not aban­doned ef­forts to for­malise PN ahead of polls, ex­pected as soon as the end of the year, de­spite a bal­lot not be­ing due un­til late 2023.</p>
    <p>“The plan is to go ahead re­gard­less of Umno. Wait for the an­nounce­ment on PN. Reg­is­tra­tion is done,” a top of­fi­cial said, adding that PAS has been amenable to be­ing a reg­is­tered mem­ber of PN.</p>
    <p>Seat ne­go­ti­a­tions are hot­ting up ahead of ex­pected snap elec­tions aimed at end­ing po­lit­i­cal in­sta­bil­ity stem­ming from Mr Muhyid­din’s nar­row par­lia­men­tary ma­jor­ity of 113 out of 222 MPs, the slimmest any Malaysian govern­ment has had.</p>
    <p>Umno, Ber­satu and PAS rep­re­sen­ta­tives met last week to be­gin duk­ing out over­lap­ping claims in at least a quar­ter of con­stituen­cies dom­i­nated by the Malay ma­jor­ity.</p>
    <p>In Ber­satu’s view, join­ing MN would pro­vide a clear plat­form for these ne­go­ti­a­tions while still pur­su­ing PN as the flag­ship coali­tion to seek a new term for its pres­i­dent, Mr Muhyid­din.</p>
    <p>De­spite its firm stance against be­com­ing a mem­ber of PN, Umno leaders have be­come more amenable to­wards an ex­tended reign for Mr Muhyid­din, so long as the party’s in­ter­ests are pro­tected.</p>
    <p>Umno deputy pres­i­dent Mo­hamad Hasan said last week the party could re­view the 2016 de­ci­sion to sack Mr Muhyid­din – a staunch critic of 1MDB while in govern­ment – when Na­jib was pres­i­dent.</p>
    <p>“He (Muhyid­din) will be a Prime Min­is­ter backed by the largest party with the most MPs... There will be no prob­lems fac­ing a gen­eral elec­tion, for ex­am­ple in the as­pect of seat al­lo­ca­tions,” he said.</p>
    <p>Umno’s ad­vi­sory coun­cil chief, Tengku Raza­leigh Hamzah, who is also the party’s long­est-serv­ing MP, said that “hand­i­capped leaders” such as Na­jib and Zahid, who are fac­ing graft charges, should make way and sac­ri­fice “just for awhile, one term is only five years”.</p>
    <p>The con­vic­tion has raised con­cerns over the sta­bil­ity of the govern­ment, as for­mer premier Na­jib Razak re­mains widely in­flu­en­tial in Umno, which sup­plies the most MPs to the Muhyid­din ad­min­is­tra­tion.</p>
