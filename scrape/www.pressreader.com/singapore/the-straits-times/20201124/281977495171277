    <p>There have been nu­mer­ous calls re­cently to ad­dress men­tal health at the work­place in the wake of the Covid-19 cri­sis (Call for bosses to foster pos­i­tive con­ver­sa­tions on men­tal health, Nov 19). The Tri­par­tite Ad­vi­sory on Men­tal Well-be­ing at Work­places is a step in the right di­rec­tion and timely (New tri­par­tite ad­vi­sory sets out steps to tackle men­tal health needs of work­ers, ST On­line, Nov 17).</p>
    <p>While the wors­en­ing of men­tal health at the work­place was ex­ac­er­bated by Covid-19, it was a con­cern even be­fore Covid due to the fre­netic tech-driven 24/7 pace of mod­ern work life, and will no doubt con­tinue be­yond Covid. We hope that com­pa­nies will take the ad­vi­sory se­ri­ously and act quickly to put in place the rec­om­mended work prac­tices to sup­port their em­ploy­ees’ men­tal well-be­ing.</p>
    <p>One good way for com­pa­nies to get up to speed on this is to work with the many com­mu­nity-based men­tal health so­cial ser­vice agen­cies (SSAs) here. These SSAs are able to give talks, con­duct work­shops and train­ing on a range of suit­able top­ics, and even or­gan­ise cre­ative ther­apy ses­sions to build up men­tal re­silience. Some can also pro­vide coun­selling ser­vices and a con­fi­den­tial chan­nel for ques­tions on men­tal health manned by pro­fes­sion­als.</p>
    <p>Un­like ac­tiv­i­ties ini­ti­ated by com­pa­nies in­de­pen­dently, a well-struc­tured, long-term part­ner­ship with a men­tal health SSA will be more holis­tic, ef­fec­tive and sus­tain­able.</p>
    <p>The SSAs also ben­e­fit by be­com­ing more aware of men­tal health is­sues at the work­place, which will help them de­velop pub­lic mes­sages and in­tro­duce ap­pro­pri­ate pre­ven­tive mea­sures.</p>
    <p>If prop­erly im­ple­mented, such pro­grammes would lead to greater men­tal re­silience, a more sup­port­ive work en­vi­ron­ment, per­haps also re­duced stigma on men­tal ill­ness. Not least, too, a de­crease in lost pro­duc­tiv­ity due to men­tal health is­sues, which the World Health Or­gan­i­sa­tion has pro­jected to be US$1 tril­lion (S$1.34 tril­lion) an­nu­ally at the global level.
