    <p>WASH­ING­TON • Mi­crosoft has said the far-reach­ing Rus­sian hack of US govern­ment agen­cies and pri­vate cor­po­ra­tions went fur­ther into its net­work than the com­pany had pre­vi­ously un­der­stood.</p>
    <p>While the hack­ers, sus­pected to be work­ing for Rus­sia’s SVR in­tel­li­gence agency, did not ap­pear to use Mi­crosoft’s sys­tems to at­tack other vic­tims, they were able to view Mi­crosoft source code by ac­cess­ing an em­ployee ac­count, the com­pany said on Thurs­day.</p>
    <p>Source code – the un­der­ly­ing set of in­struc­tions that run a piece of soft­ware or op­er­at­ing sys­tem – is typ­i­cally among a tech firm’s most closely guarded se­crets.</p>
    <p>Mi­crosoft said the hack­ers were un­able to ac­cess e-mails or its prod­ucts and ser­vices, and that they were not able to mod­ify the source code they viewed.</p>
    <p>It did not say how long hack­ers were in­side its net­works or which prod­ucts’ source code had been viewed. Mi­crosoft had ini­tially said it was not breached in the at­tack.</p>
    <p>Three sources briefed on the mat­ter said the firm had known for days that the source code had been ac­cessed.</p>
    <p>A Mi­crosoft spokesman said se­cu­rity em­ploy­ees had been work­ing around the clock and that when there is ac­tion­able in­for­ma­tion to share, they have pub­lished and shared it.</p>
    <p>The hack, which may be on­go­ing, ap­pears to have be­gun as far back as Oc­to­ber 2019. That was when hack­ers first breached the Texas com­pany So­larWinds, which pro­vides tech­nol­ogy mon­i­tor­ing ser­vices to govern­ment agen­cies and 425 of the For­tune 500 com­pa­nies.</p>
    <p>The com­pro­mised soft­ware was then used to pen­e­trate the US Com­merce, Trea­sury, State and En­ergy de­part­ments, as well as FireEye, a top cy­ber-se­cu­rity firm that first re­vealed the breach last month.</p>
    <p>In­ves­ti­ga­tors are still try­ing to un­der­stand what the hack­ers stole, and on­go­ing in­ves­ti­ga­tions sug­gest the at­tack is more wide­spread than ini­tially believed.</p>
    <p>In the past week, Crowd­Strike, a FireEye com­peti­tor, an­nounced that it too had been tar­geted, un­suc­cess­fully, by the same at­tack­ers. In that case, the hack­ers used Mi­crosoft re­sellers – com­pa­nies that sell soft­ware on Mi­crosoft’s be­half – to try to ac­cess its sys­tems.</p>
    <p>In its blog post, Mi­crosoft said it had found no ev­i­dence of ac­cess to pro­duc­tion ser­vices or cus­tomer data. “The in­ves­ti­ga­tion, which is on­go­ing, has also found no in­di­ca­tions that our sys­tems were used to at­tack oth­ers.”</p>
