    <p>A taxi driver who hit a stu­dent at a ze­bra cross­ing in 2017, leav­ing her with trau­matic brain in­juries, was yes­ter­day sen­tenced to three months’ jail and banned from driv­ing for two years. Cabby Eu Hock Leng, 64, had pleaded guilty to one count of com­mit­ting a rash act.</p>
    <p>A taxi driver whose ve­hi­cle hit a stu­dent at a ze­bra cross­ing in 2017, leav­ing her with trau­matic brain in­juries, was yes­ter­day sen­tenced to three months’ jail and banned from driv­ing for two years.</p>
    <p>Cabby Eu Hock Leng, 64, had pleaded guilty to one count of com­mit­ting a rash act.</p>
    <p>The girl was in the midst of her A-level ex­ams at the time and not only missed the rest of her pa­pers but has also not man­aged to com­plete her A lev­els since.</p>
    <p>Al­most a year af­ter the ac­ci­dent that took place on Nov 17, 2017, she still had dif­fi­cul­ties in com­pre­hen­sion, plan­ning and nu­mer­i­cal prob­lem solv­ing.</p>
    <p>The court heard that Eu was driv­ing at over 20kmh in Bukit Ba­tok West Av­enue 7 at around 7.30pm that day when he hit the girl, who was then 18.</p>
    <p>He had not no­ticed the ze­bra cross­ing as he was check­ing his cab’s mo­bile dis­play ter­mi­nal for a book­ing.</p>
    <p>His taxi mounted the el­e­vated ze­bra cross­ing and hit the vic­tim, who was just a few metres from reach­ing the other side of the road, ac­cord­ing to court documents.</p>
    <p>She was flung onto the road. Eu stopped the ve­hi­cle and got out to check on the vic­tim, who was ob­served to be semi-con­scious and drowsy. She cried and vom­ited.</p>
    <p>A by­stander who was at a nearby bus stop when the ac­ci­dent hap­pened at the ze­bra cross­ing called the am­bu­lance.</p>
    <p>A friend of the vic­tim who was in the vicin­ity learnt of the ac­ci­dent and rushed to the scene, where she con­fronted a fran­tic Eu.</p>
    <p>The cabby said he had been driv­ing at a low speed and that his car did not have any dents or scratches from the ac­ci­dent.</p>
    <p>“He ex­claimed ‘aiyah’, be­fore say­ing he had picked up a call and did not see the vic­tim. He lamented that the vic­tim was so close to the pave­ment, and that she al­most made it,” said court documents, quot­ing the friend.</p>
    <p>The vic­tim, who suf­fered brain con­tu­sions and frac­tures and lost her sense of smell, was hos­pi­talised for 15 days.</p>
    <p>She then had to un­dergo in­ten­sive re­ha­bil­i­ta­tion treat­ment, in­clud­ing phys­io­ther­apy, oc­cu­pa­tional ther­apy and speech ther­apy.</p>
    <p>A med­i­cal re­port dated Aug 2, 2018, showed that she could still be at risk of long-term con­di­tions re­sult­ing from her in­juries, de­spite re­cov­er­ing from the com­pli­ca­tions of her acute trau­matic brain in­jury.</p>
    <p>She had dif­fi­cul­ties multi-task­ing and was mildly im­paired in terms of plan­ning, com­pre­hend­ing and re­call­ing things heard, as well as in her nu­mer­i­cal prob­lem solv­ing abil­i­ties, ac­cord­ing to the re­port.</p>
    <p>Court documents said she “ex­pe­ri­enced a tremen­dous sense of loss”, still suf­fers from back­aches when sit­ting on the floor and is af­fected emo­tion­ally when she is re­minded of the in­ci­dent.</p>
