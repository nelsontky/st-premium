    <p>In­dia’s densely pop­u­lated eastern states have been swamped by mon­soon floods, forc­ing more than a mil­lion peo­ple into makeshift shel­ters. The floods have killed more than 10 peo­ple and in­jured more than 70 in the states of As­sam, Bi­har and Jhark­hand.</p>
    <p>GUWA­HATI (In­dia) • Mon­soon floods have swamped large parts of In­dia’s densely pop­u­lated eastern states, forc­ing more than a mil­lion peo­ple into makeshift shel­ters de­spite the risk of the coro­n­avirus, se­nior of­fi­cials said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Tor­ren­tial an­nual rains are cru­cial for agri­cul­ture in South Asia, but this year, In­dia is also grap­pling with the virus, which has in­fected over 976,000 and killed over 25,000, the health au­thor­i­ties say.</p>
    <p>The floods have killed at least 10 peo­ple and in­jured more than 70 in the states of As­sam, Bi­har and Jhark­hand, where heavy rain has sub­merged thou­sands of vil­lages as the au­thor­i­ties bat­tle to en­sure so­cial dis­tanc­ing in re­lief camps.</p>
    <p>“We have floods tak­ing a deadly turn and si­mul­ta­ne­ously we are fight­ing the pan­demic spread­ing its ten­ta­cles ev­ery­where,” As­sam’s Health Min­is­ter Hi­manta Biswa Sarma told Reuters.</p>
    <p>At a time when world at­ten­tion is fo­cused on the cri­sis in the United States and South America, a hu­man tragedy is swiftly un­fold­ing in South Asia, said Mr John Flem­ing of the In­ter­na­tional Fed­er­a­tion of Red Cross and Red Cres­cent So­ci­eties.</p>
    <p>“Covid-19 is spread­ing at an alarm­ing rate in South Asia, home to a quar­ter of hu­man­ity,” said Mr Flem­ing, the group’s head of health in the Asia-Pa­cific re­gion.</p>
    <p>“In­dia alone is near­ing one mil­lion in­fec­tions in com­ing days.”</p>
    <p>Of­fi­cials said that swathes of As­sam’s Kazi­ranga Na­tional Park had been sub­merged, with at least 50 wild an­i­mals dead, while some rhi­nos had strayed into vil­lages, adding to the haz­ards that re­lief and res­cue work­ers face.</p>
    <p>The Unesco World Her­itage site is home to two-thirds of the world’s pop­u­la­tion of the one­horned rhi­noc­eros.</p>
