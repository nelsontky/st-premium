    <p>KUALA LUMPUR • Malaysia has de­cided to lift a limit on the hir­ing of for­eign work­ers that was meant to pro­tect jobs for lo­cals in most sec­tors, said the Hu­man Re­sources Min­istry late on Thurs­day.</p>
    <p>The min­istry had said last month that the hir­ing of for­eign labour would be lim­ited to the con­struc­tion, agri­cul­ture and plan­ta­tion sec­tors, a move to in­crease em­ploy­ment op­por­tu­ni­ties for lo­cals af­fected by the coron­avirus pan­demic.</p>
    <p>It said that more than 67,000 lo­cal work­ers and over 4,700 for­eign work­ers had lost their jobs as of last month.</p>
    <p>“How­ever, there were some em­ploy­ers who claimed to still need a num­ber of for­eign work­ers and urged the gov­ern­ment to with­draw the freeze on re­cruit­ment of new for­eign work­ers,” Hu­man Re­sources Min­is­ter Sar­a­vanan Mu­ru­gan said in a state­ment on Thurs­day.</p>
    <p>He urged em­ploy­ers to pri­ori­tise fill­ing job va­can­cies with lo­cal work­ers be­fore con­sid­er­ing re-em­ploy­ing for­eign work­ers who are still in Malaysia with a valid work per­mit. The for­eign work­ers, if re­hired, must work in the same sec­tors they were pre­vi­ously em­ployed in.</p>
    <p>Datuk Seri Sar­a­vanan said that em­ploy­ers should also en­sure that the for­eign work­ers to be re­hired have been tested for Covid-19, the res­pi­ra­tory disease caused by the coron­avirus.</p>
    <p>Malaysia hosts about 2.1 mil­lion doc­u­mented for­eign work­ers, ac­cord­ing to gov­ern­ment es­ti­mates.</p>
    <p>Unemployme­nt rose after the gov­ern­ment im­posed strict curbs on move­ment and busi­nesses for most of the sec­ond quar­ter to con­tain the spread of the coron­avirus.</p>
    <p>These re­stric­tions have been grad­u­ally eased since May, as the num­ber of new in­fec­tions fell.</p>
