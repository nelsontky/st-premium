    <p>OR­LANDO (Flor­ida) • Paul Ge­orge has blown hot and cold for the Los An­ge­les Clip­pers through­out their open­ing se­ries of the Na­tional Bas­ket­ball As­so­ci­a­tion (NBA) play-offs with the Dallas Mav­er­icks, lead­ing to praise and de­ri­sion in equal parts.</p>
    <p>His team­mate Kawhi Leonard, has, how­ever, been his usual model of con­sis­tency.</p>
    <p>The post-sea­son is when the for­ward shines, and the Fi­nals Most Valu­able Player again showed what he is about on Sun­day, pac­ing the Clip­pers with 33 points as they beat the Mav­er­icks 111-97, elim­i­nat­ing them 4-2 at Dis­ney World.</p>
    <p>It was an all-round ef­fort at both ends of the floor as he also had a game-high 14 boards, joint teamhigh seven as­sists and five steals, mak­ing him just the sev­enth player in NBA his­tory to have at least 30 points, 10 re­bounds, five as­sists and five steals in a play-off game.</p>
    <p>Un­like Ge­orge, who was yet again poor on the night with 15 points – he had a to­tal of 34 points in Games 2, 3 and 4 – this was Leonard’s fifth 30-point per­for­mance in a row.</p>
    <p>The two-time league win­ner,</p>
    <p>KAWHI, THAT’S WHY</p>
    <p>Kawhi’s a man of busi­ness. He stepped up and stepped in time af­ter time, when­ever we needed him, he put us on his back and he fin­ished the se­ries.</p>
    <p>’’</p>
    <p>PAUL GE­ORGE, Clip­pers’ All-Star guard, on the team’s leader Kawhi Leonard car­ry­ing them into the next round.</p>
    <p>who spear­headed the Toronto Rap­tors’ maiden cham­pi­onship run last year, was non­cha­lant about his hot streak af­ter seal­ing their Western Con­fer­ence sec­ond-round matchup with the win­ners of the Utah Jazz-Den­ver Nuggets se­ries, which is tied at 3-3.</p>
    <p>“Just got to my spots and put up the shot with con­fi­dence and it went in,” he said.</p>
    <p>“Just kept giv­ing it to me and it went in with con­fi­dence.</p>
    <p>“Mo­men­tum, it can switch real eas­ily. You have to keep fight­ing when you’re up and when you’re down, stay fo­cused.”</p>
    <p>Fel­low All-Star Ge­orge also ad­mit­ted it was Leonard and not him that was the team’s go-to guy.</p>
    <p>“I mean Kawhi’s a man of busi­ness,” the for­ward told ESPN. “He stepped up and stepped in time af­ter time, when­ever we needed him, he put us on his back and he fin­ished the se­ries.</p>
    <p>“I can’t say it enough. Af­ter this se­ries, he’s the most re­li­able guy. His shot­mak­ing and his time on aware­ness plays – he is one of a kind.”</p>
    <p>Clip­pers coach Doc Rivers, whose team have never made it past the West Fi­nals, added: “You could tell he (Leonard) was the one guy that was used to clos­ing out a se­ries.</p>
    <p>“He was calm, he got us in place. Dur­ing games, you fall on a set, and we fell on that lit­tle el­bow set for him. He just took what was there. If they didn’t come, he scored; if they came, he made the right pass.”</p>
    <p>The Clip­pers next play on Thurs­day af­ter Ja­mal Mur­ray posted his sec­ond 50-point game of the open­ing round as the Nuggets beat the Jazz 119-107. Den­ver is try­ing to be­come the 12th team to rally from a 3-1 deficit to win a se­ries and the first in four years, with Game 7 tak­ing place to­day.</p>
    <p>In the East, Jayson Ta­tum and Mar­cus Smart each scored 21 points to lead the Bos­ton Celtics over the Rap­tors 112-94 as the sec­ond-round se­ries got un­der way.</p>
