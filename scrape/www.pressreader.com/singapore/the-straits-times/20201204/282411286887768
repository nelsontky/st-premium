    <p>LON­DON • Two days af­ter the Rus­sian Ath­let­ics Fed­er­a­tion (Rusaf) elected a new pres­i­dent, World Ath­let­ics ( WA) sug­gested on Wed­nes­day that there was light at the end of a tun­nel in terms of the coun­try’s re­turn to the sport.</p>
    <p>Rus­sian ath­let­ics has been in tur­moil since its fed­er­a­tion was banned by WA in 2015 on the back of a state-spon­sored dop­ing scan­dal. Rusaf paid a multi-mil­lion dol­lar fine in Au­gust to hold off a fur­ther sus­pen­sion, hav­ing made lit­tle progress along the road map for a re­turn set by WA’s task force.</p>
    <p>How­ever, Rune An­der­sen, the head of the task force who has re­peat­edly voiced his frus­tra­tion at the fail­ure of Rus­sian of­fi­cials to fol­low the nec­es­sary steps or show a change of cul­ture, told WA’s coun­cil this week that his ini­tial dis­cus­sions with new Rusaf pres­i­dent Py­otr Ivanov had given him re­newed hope.</p>
    <p>“Over the last few months, progress has been made and there is a new Rusaf lead­er­ship to put in place the plan,” he told a news con­fer­ence, fol­low­ing an “open and con­struc­tive” call with Ivanov.</p>
    <p>The Nor­we­gian said a well-qual­i­fied in­ter­na­tional panel of ex­perts has been ap­pointed to work with Rusaf to draw up a de­tailed plan with ob­jec­tives and time­lines.</p>
    <p>“The ex­perts have al­ready be­gun work­ing and re­ported that the team have been very re­spon­sive and con­struc­tive in their ap­proach,” he added.</p>
    <p>“The stage has there­fore been set for the new pres­i­dent, if he puts the nec­es­sary com­mit­ment and re­sources be­hind the project, and wins the sup­port of the nec­es­sary stake­hold­ers.</p>
    <p>“Then the panel of ex­perts are ready to help im­ple­ment the re­in­state­ment of Rusaf’s mem­ber­ship of world ath­let­ics and the rein­tro­duc­tion of its ath­letes into in­ter­na­tional com­pe­ti­tion.”</p>
    <p>He said that might be be­fore the March 1 dead­line of de­liv­er­ing a plan and that his or­gan­i­sa­tion would con­sider it then if Rusaf de­liv­ers. Should the im­passe fi­nally end, it would open the door for</p>
    <p>Rus­sians to not only com­pete at next year’s World Ath­let­ics cham­pi­onships in Eu­gene but also at the Tokyo Olympics.</p>
    <p>How­ever, that is de­pen­dent on Rus­sia suc­ceed­ing in its ap­peal to the Court of Ar­bi­tra­tion for Sport against the coun­try’s blan­ket sport­ing ban for sup­ply­ing doc­tored data to the World Anti- Dop­ing Agency.</p>
    <p>The tri­bunal heard the ap­peal last month and is ex­pected to make a de­ci­sion by the end of this month.</p>
