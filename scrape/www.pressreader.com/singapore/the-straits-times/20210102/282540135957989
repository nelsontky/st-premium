    <p>RACE 1 (1,800M)</p>
    <p>(7) CAS­TLE COR­NER and (1) LEAD­ING LAD have been strug­gling to shed their maiden sta­tus. But one of them could do it with some im­prove­ment here. Pref­er­ence goes to Cas­tle Cor­ner, who has blink­ers re­fit­ted.</p>
    <p>(5) FAST DRAW has had his chances. He can con­tinue to earn his keep.</p>
    <p>(8) USHUAIA was not dis­graced on de­but. The colt should be fit­ter.</p>
    <p>RACE 2 (1,400M)</p>
    <p>(10) NAMIB DESERT eased in the bet­ting on de­but but ran on strongly for a close se­cond. He rates as the one to beat.</p>
    <p>(8) DOU­BLE MAR­TINI was not dis­graced on de­but. The ex­tra dis­tance will suit.</p>
    <p>(2) MANTERIO can be con­sid­ered, if he does not ac­cept an ear­lier en­gage­ment.</p>
    <p>(4) WILDEYE, his sta­ble­mate, is sure to im­prove with the ex­tra dis­tance.</p>
    <p>RACE 3 (1,400M)</p>
    <p>(11) SAY WHEN pulled up not strid­ing out last time and was un­ex­pect­edly beaten. With a 4kg claim and a trou­ble-free run, the filly could make amends.</p>
    <p>(10) EMER­ALD FLOE, her sta­ble­mate, could also ben­e­fit from the filly’s al­lowance.</p>
    <p>(3) DAWN OF A NEW ERA looks ready to give a good show­ing over a pre­ferred trip.</p>
    <p>(4) EURO CENT is hav­ing his peak run and could fea­ture.</p>
    <p>RACE 4 (1,200M)</p>
    <p>(1) CAP­TAIN DIZZY and (3) SU­PE­RIOR LEADER have improved with each run. They could play a lead­ing role with fur­ther progress. Su­pe­rior Leader is the pick of the in-form Grant van Niek­erk over sta­ble­mate and well-bred new­comer (10) SON OF SILK.</p>
    <p>(2) WORDSWORTH is likely to be com­pet­i­tive af­ter back-to-back sec­onds over the track and trip with blink­ers fit­ted.</p>
    <p>(9) PREEMPTIVE STRIKE is likely to im­prove af­ter a pleas­ing de­but.</p>
    <p>RACE 5 (1,400M)</p>
    <p>(3) PUSH OFF was nar­rowly beaten in his post-maiden run, but is on the up. He can chalk up his se­cond win in his fourth start. (5) NAMAQUALAN­D needed his first run as a geld­ing and should go on with it.</p>
    <p>(7) RIVER JOR­DAN is hav­ing his third run af­ter a rest and could dou­ble-up over this course and dis­tance.</p>
    <p>(1) DAN THE LAD can­not be ig­nored over this trip. The 4kg claim will help.</p>
    <p>RACE 6 (1,400M)</p>
    <p>(1) CAP­TAIN WHO has looked a win­ner in wait­ing since his promis­ing de­but third. A sub­se­quent fourth over this trip and a se­cond over 1,200m last start sug­gest he is ready to win re­vert­ing to 1,400m. (5) HIKARU and (6) FIRSTAMONG­EQUALS are the threats. They fin­ished close-up last time over the course and dis­tance.</p>
    <p>(2) BUM­RAH has earn­ing po­ten­tial.</p>
    <p>Watch the bet­ting on the new­com­ers, who could have a role to play if they are not too green.</p>
    <p>RACE 7 (1,400M)</p>
    <p>(1) ANY­THING GOES is go­ing for six straight wins.</p>
    <p>(2) WAR OF ATHENA was beaten twice by Any­thing Goes, but is fit­ter and could have her re­venge.</p>
    <p>(3) SENTBYDEST­INY is no slouch, but is a dif­fi­cult cus­tomer. If she set­tles, she could fin­ish strongly.</p>
    <p>(4) GEE FOR GO and (5) CARALLUMA’S should im­prove af­ter they pulled up stiff be­hind and were not strid­ing out last start.</p>
    <p>RACE 8 (2,500M)</p>
    <p>(2) NIGHT SONG is step­ping up in dis­tance af­ter facile wins over the shorter trip. He could be hard to beat if as ef­fec­tive over this trip. (3) HALF AND HALF was twice beaten by Night Song, but is likely to pose a threat step­ping up to this dis­tance on re­vised weight terms. (4) MELIORA is dis­tance-suited. He has been suc­cess­ful at this level.</p>
    <p>(6) WAR­RIOR BLING and (7) SIX HILLS GI­ANT, both pro­gres­sive last-start win­ners, should have more to of­fer with ex­pe­ri­ence un­der light weights.</p>
    <p>RACE 9 (1,400M)</p>
    <p>(1) CATCH TWENTYTWO</p>
    <p>(2) MK’S PRIDE</p>
    <p>beat sta­ble­mate by just over two lengths last time but has 200m less to travel. Both are top class and it could go ei­ther way. (4) COP­PER MOUNTAIN has not been out of the first two in six starts, but has yet to tackle this class.</p>
    <p>(6) FLY­ING CAR­PET and (5) BINGWA per­formed well in the fea­tures races and could get into the mix.</p>
    <p>RACE 10 (1,200M)</p>
    <p>(5) CAPITANA ran above her rat­ing when se­cond over the course and dis­tance be­hind the classy Clouds Un­folds. She needs only to re­peat that ef­fort to re­turn to win­ning ways.</p>
    <p>(1) BOOMPS A DAISY, her sta­ble com­pan­ion, was a flu­ent win­ner over 1,000m last start, when fit­ted with blink­ers. She should make her pres­ence felt if build­ing on that ef­fort with the head­gear re­tained. (4) DARK CRYS­TAL and (2) ON CAP­TAIN’S SIDE have set a good stan­dard and will keep those prin­ci­pals hon­est.</p>
    <p>RACE 11 (1,800M)</p>
    <p>(2) BARAHIN comes off a lengthy lay­off. If fit and fresh, he could take ad­van­tage of the mod­er­ate field to score. (6) RUN­NING BRAVE gave her best with a gutsy ef­fort when a clear se­cond to Sum­mer Pudding in the Sum­mer Cup. The mare should go well again.</p>
    <p>(1) ZILLZAAL and (3) DI­VINE ODYSSEY dis­ap­pointed in their last start, but they are ca­pa­ble of do­ing a lot bet­ter.</p>
    <p>(4) CHI­JMES was not dis­graced in his come­back run and should make his pres­ence felt.</p>
    <p>RACE 12 (1,600M) (1) SO FLAW­LESS MING</p>
    <p>and (3) KUNran well in a stronger race over the course and dis­tance on their hand­i­cap de­but. They need only to re­pro­duce those ef­forts to play lead­ing roles.</p>
    <p>(2) BLACK SIL­VER opened her ac­count over this trip and should im­prove to pose a threat. She is well bred.</p>
    <p>(6) TWO PENNIES and (5) WIN­TER’S AWAK­EN­ING are closely matched on re­cent form. They could stake a claim.</p>
    <p>RACE 13 (1,800M)</p>
    <p>(4) VIC­TOR LAZLO im­pressed when win­ning his maiden race at his third start. He looks to have plenty of scope for im­prove­ment. (1) VALIDUS could be un­der­rated. Watch for a good ef­fort.</p>
    <p>(2) GIMMETHEGO­AHEAD was not dis­graced in his first run as a geld­ing. He can only im­prove.</p>
    <p>(8) PAMUSHANA’S PRIDE and (7) TROOPER worked hard for their maiden wins and can go on with fur­ther progress.</p>
