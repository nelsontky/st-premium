    <p>Malaysia’s King, Sul­tan Ab­dul­lah Ah­mad Shah, yes­ter­day ad­vised his sub­jects “to stay calm, not to panic and be pa­tient” as the monarch pre­pared to meet other Malay rulers on a re­quest by Prime Min­is­ter Muhyid­din Yassin to im­pose emer­gency mea­sures.</p>
    <p>“Sul­tan Ab­dul­lah Ah­mad Shah will hold a meet­ing with the Malay rulers at Is­tana Ne­gara as soon as pos­si­ble to dis­cuss and re­fine the sug­ges­tions pro­posed by Tan Sri Muhyid­din Yassin,” palace comptrolle­r In­dera Ah­mad Fadil Sham­sud­din said in a state­ment.</p>
    <p>It also said that the King “very much un­der­stands the need for con­ti­nu­ity in the coun­try’s ad­min­is­tra­tion to bat­tle the threat of the Covid-19 pandemic”.</p>
    <p>The Star news­pa­per re­ported that the in­for­mal meet­ing of the rulers will be held to­day at 2.30pm.</p>
    <p>It has been a tu­mul­tuous two days af­ter Mr Muhyid­din met the King to seek his con­sent to in­voke emer­gency pow­ers.</p>
    <p>On Fri­day morn­ing, Mr Muhyid­din chaired a spe­cial Cab­i­net meet­ing in Pu­tra­jaya to dis­cuss the procla­ma­tion of an “eco­nomic emer­gency”. It would en­sure that po­lit­i­cal up­heaval did not jeop­ar­dise gov­ern­ment spend­ing to curb the Covid-19 sit­u­a­tion, which con­tin­ues to de­te­ri­o­rate sharply in the coun­try with a record high of 1,228 new cases yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Mr Muhyid­din faces the prospect of a no-con­fi­dence vote when Par­lia­ment con­venes on Nov 6 to dis­cuss the na­tional bud­get. There are fears that the Prime Min­is­ter, who had only a ra­zor-thin ma­jor­ity of two in the pre­vi­ous par­lia­men­tary sit­ting, could lose the con­fi­dence vote, leav­ing the bud­get in limbo.</p>
    <p>Fur­ther­more, this could trig­ger a new gen­eral elec­tion in the mid­dle of a rag­ing pandemic, an op­tion both sides of the po­lit­i­cal di­vide are keen to avoid.</p>
    <p>An emer­gency dec­la­ra­tion could sus­pend Par­lia­ment, which would pre-empt any at­tempts at un­der­min­ing Mr Muhyid­din’s Perikatan Na­sional gov­ern­ment.</p>
    <p>Fed­eral Ter­ri­to­ries Min­is­ter An­nuar Musa has de­fended the emer­gency pro­posal, ask­ing what other le­gal pro­vi­sion would al­low an elec­tion in Malaysia to be de­layed amid a pandemic.</p>
    <p>He was re­spond­ing to crit­i­cism from the op­po­si­tion and civil so­ci­ety, some of whom have de­nounced the gov­ern­ment’s move as un­demo­cratic and an at­tempt by the Muhyid­din ad­min­is­tra­tion to stay in power.</p>
    <p>In a post­ing on Twit­ter, he claimed that most Malaysians did not want to go to the polls, hav­ing seen how last month’s state elec­tion in Sabah trig­gered record num­bers of in­fec­tions and deaths.</p>
    <p>In a sep­a­rate Face­book post, Tan Sri An­nuar said that “var­i­ous par­ties are threat­en­ing to top­ple the Prime Min­is­ter through the Par­lia­ment sit­ting next month”.</p>
    <p>“If that hap­pens, the PM can dis­solve Par­lia­ment and a gen­eral elec­tion must be held.”</p>
    <p>Na­tional polls are not due un­til 2023, but a po­lit­i­cal cri­sis was trig­gered ear­lier this month when Op­po­si­tion Leader An­war Ibrahim claimed that he had se­cured a “for­mi­da­ble ma­jor­ity” in Par­lia­ment.</p>
    <p>For­mer premier Ma­hathir Mo­hamad has also spo­ken out against the emer­gency move, say­ing that there was no break­down of law and or­der to jus­tify such a dec­la­ra­tion.</p>
    <p>“Coun­tries with more se­vere Covid-19 prob­lems have not de­clared an emer­gency for the whole coun­try, but only for af­fected ar­eas,” he said.</p>
    <p>A group of lawyers com­pris­ing for­mer Bar pres­i­dents said declar­ing an emer­gency would be a “night­mar­ish” er­ror that would plunge Malaysia into one of its “dark­est” days.</p>
