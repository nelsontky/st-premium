    <p>IN­DONE­SIA PRES­I­DENT JOKO WI­DODO, DE­FEND­ING LABOUR RE­FORMS AMID PROTESTS A21</p>
    <p>•</p>
    <p>WASHINGTON The World Health Or­gan­i­sa­tion (WHO) re­ported yet an­other record one-day in­crease in global coro­n­avirus cases on Thurs­day, with the to­tal ris­ing by more than 338,000 in 24 hours, led by a surge of in­fec­tions in Europe.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day’s num­ber of global new cases looked set to hit yet an­other high, with some 360,000 ad­di­tional in­fec­tions al­ready re­ported, based on statis­tics from Our World in Data as of last night.</p>
    <p>Europe re­ported nearly 97,000 new cases on Thurs­day, the high­est to­tal for the re­gion ever recorded by the global health body.</p>
    <p>Global deaths rose by more than 5,500 that day, to 1.05 mil­lion.</p>
    <p>The pre­vi­ous WHO record for new cases was 330,340 on Oct 2.</p>
    <p>The agency re­ported a record 12,393 deaths on April 17.</p>
    <p>As a re­gion, Europe is now re­port­ing more cases than In­dia, Brazil or the United States.</p>
    <p>In­dia re­ported over 78,000 new cases on Thurs­day, fol­lowed by Brazil at nearly 42,000 and the US with al­most 39,000 new i nfec­tions, ac­cord­ing to the WHO, whose data l ags each coun­try’s daily re­ports.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to a Reuters analysis of more re­cent coun­try data, Covid-19 in­fec­tions are ris­ing in 54 coun­tries, in­clud­ing surges in Ar­gentina, Canada and much of Europe.</p>
    <p>In­fec­tions in Bri­tain have reached record lev­els, with more than 17,000 new cases re­ported on Thurs­day.</p>
    <p>“We are see­ing a def­i­nite and sus­tained in­crease in cases and ad­mis­sions to hos­pi­tal. The trend is clear, and it is very con­cern­ing,” said Dr Yvonne Doyle, med­i­cal di­rec­tor for Pub­lic Health Eng­land.</p>
    <p>Bri­tish Health Min­is­ter Matt Han­cock warned that the coun­try was at a “per­ilous moment”, with Par­lia­ment set to vote on Tues­day on the im­po­si­tion of a 10pm clos­ing time for English pubs, bars and restau­rants.</p>
    <p>France’s new daily Covid-19 in­fec­tions re­mained above the record 18,000 thresh­old for a sec­ond con­sec­u­tive day on Thurs­day, with new mea­sures to curb the out­break ex­pected.</p>
    <p>The seven-day rolling av­er­age of new cases climbed to 13,448, the high­est since the out­break started.</p>
    <p>In Bel­gium, the av­er­age num­ber of new i nfec­tions re­ported has been i ncreas­ing for seven days straight, and Ger­many re­ported its big­gest daily in­crease in new cases since April on Thurs­day.</p>
    <p>Ro­ma­nia and the Czech Re­pub­lic are also suf­fer­ing from a surge of new cases, with the Ro­ma­nian au­thor­i­ties forced to sus­pend flights to and from high-risk coun­tries and the Czech gov­ern­ment fur­ther tight­en­ing anti-virus mea­sures from next week.</p>
    <p>While In­dia still leads in the globe in the num­ber of new cases re­ported per day, new in­fec­tions in the coun­try are in fact down some</p>
    <p>20 per cent from the peak.</p>
    <p>In the US, which has the largest to­tal num­ber of cases and deaths in the world, new in­fec­tions are edg­ing higher, along with the num­ber of Covid-19 hos­pi­tal­i­sa­tions.</p>
    <p>Out­breaks – from New Jersey to</p>
    <p>North Dakota – are strain­ing health­care in parts of the US, less than a month be­fore the pres­i­den­tial elec­tion on Nov 3.</p>
    <p>Texas’ virus hos­pi­tal­i­sa­tions rose for a fourth straight day to 3,556, the high­est since Sept 10, ac­cord­ing to state health de­part­ment data. It is the long­est stretch of daily in­creases since July, when the state’s out­break was at its worst.</p>
    <p>In the Mid­dle East, the world’s largest an­nual re­li­gious gath­er­ing is in full swing and pos­ing for­mi­da­ble health haz­ards for the Iraqi au­thor­i­ties al­ready strug­gling with a rise in in­fec­tions.</p>
    <p>Jor­dan yes­ter­day entered a na­tion­wide 48-hour lock­down, for the first time in months.</p>
