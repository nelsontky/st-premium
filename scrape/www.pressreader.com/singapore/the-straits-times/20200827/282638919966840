    <p>LOS AN­GE­LES • A for­mer em­ployee of gos­sip out­let TMZ and a re­lated web­site filed a dis­crim­i­na­tion com­plaint on Tues­day with the fed­eral Equal Em­ploy­ment Op­por­tu­nity Com­mis­sion and the Cal­i­for­nia state De­part­ment of Fair Em­ploy­ment and Hous­ing, say­ing she was wrong­fully fired af­ter com­plain­ing about a misog­y­nis­tic work­place un­der the lead­er­ship of Mr Har­vey Levin.</p>
    <p>The for­mer em­ployee, Ms Ber­nadette Zilio, 27, said in her com­plaint that she faced dis­crim­i­na­tion and was threat­ened with a law­suit if she went pub­lic with her case.</p>
    <p>Ms Zilio and her fe­male col­leagues de­scribed the work­place as a “boys’ club”, a “bro-fest” and a</p>
    <p>“frat house”, ac­cord­ing to the com­plaint, in which women were be­lit­tled and held to a higher stan­dard than their male col­leagues.</p>
    <p>Ms Zilio worked at the celebri­tynews pow­er­house from 2015 to this year and served as an on-air host of the syn­di­cated show TMZ On TV (2007 to present).</p>
    <p>In her com­plaint, she named Mr Levin, Warner Bros, the pro­duc­tion com­pany EHM and two male ed­i­to­rial em­ploy­ees. TMZ and re­lated site TooFab are part of Warner Bros, the AT&T-owned en­ter­tain­ment com­pany that pro­duces The Ellen De­Generes Show, which re­cently ousted three top pro­duc­ers dur­ing an in­ves­ti­ga­tion of what was said to be a toxic work en­vi­ron­ment.</p>
    <p>In a state­ment, lawyers for Ms Zilio said: “The only way to fix a toxic work en­vi­ron­ment is to truly en­cour­age em­ploy­ees to speak up and pro­vide a gen­uinely ef­fec­tive av­enue to raise con­cerns.”</p>
    <p>They added that she “was shunned af­ter she first com­plained, fired af­ter she com­plained a sec­ond time and then threat­ened if she dared to speak pub­licly about her ex­pe­ri­ences”.</p>
    <p>A rep­re­sen­ta­tive for TMZ and TooFab said in a state­ment that Ms Zilio was fired from the com­pany “be­cause of mul­ti­ple and doc­u­mented in­ci­dents of pla­gia­rism and in­ac­cu­rate re­port­ing” and called her com­plaint “a bla­tant at­tempt to use neg­a­tive pub­lic­ity and in­ac­cu­rate claims to force TooFab and TMZ to pay a mone­tary set­tle­ment”.</p>
    <p>The state­ment added that TMZ and TooFab would “vig­or­ously” de­fend the de­ci­sion to part ways with her.</p>
    <p>Ms Zilio said she first com­plained to the hu­man re­sources de­part­ments of Warner Bros and EHM in 2017. When the work­place did not im­prove, she com­plained again.</p>
    <p>She said she was fired from her job in Fe­bru­ary. At the time of her de­par­ture, the com­plaint says, Warner Bros and other par­ties named in her com­plaint threat­ened to sue her for “sub­stan­tial li­a­bil­ity” if she made her claims pub­lic.</p>
    <p>Warner Bros de­clined to com­ment.</p>
