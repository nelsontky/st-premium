    <p>It was per­fect ju-jitsu. Af­ter weeks of watch­ing US Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump pres­sure Chi­nese tech com­pany ByteDance to sell its so­cial me­dia app Tik­Tok to Mi­crosoft, Bei­jing struck back, us­ing one of Mr Trump’s own weapons of choice – ex­port con­trols. The Chi­nese author­i­ties ex­panded the Mid­dle King­dom’s list of con­trolled ex­ports to in­clude al­go­rithms, which are of course Tik­Tok’s main as­set.</p>
    <p>As the mother of a teenager who spends too much time watch­ing 15-sec­ond bursts of phys­i­cal com­edy on the app, I can tell you that they are very good at keep­ing you hooked.</p>
    <p>The move is in large part po­lit­i­cal.</p>
    <p>Tik­Tok is hardly as strate­gic as, say, 5G equip­ment-maker Huawei. Yet as one Chi­nese in­vestor put it to me, it wouldn’t do for Bei­jing to al­low the Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion to ap­pear to “force a liq­ui­da­tion sale” of the vi­ral video app, even at a time when the Chi­nese author­i­ties are clearly keen to avoid any build-up of ten­sions be­tween the coun­tries be­fore the Novem­ber elec­tion.</p>
    <p>But the use of ex­port con­trols by Bei­jing to po­ten­tially thwart a deal also un­der­scores that it is not just the United States, but also China, that is mov­ing to de­cou­ple its tech­nol­ogy in­dus­try.</p>
    <p>Al­ready, emerg­ing na­tions rep­re­sent a larger ex­port mar­ket for China than the US, ac­cord­ing to Gavekal Drago­nomics/Mac­robond data. Bei­jing’s Belt and Road Ini­tia­tive and its trade-based di­plo­macy in places such as Africa and the Mid­dle East, com­bined with the rise of the dig­i­tal ren­minbi, will make it ever eas­ier for China to grow its ex­ports to places other than the US.</p>
    <p>The Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion has tried to off­set these ef­forts by deny­ing Huawei the US-made chips and soft­ware that it re­quires for its am­bi­tious global 5G roll-out. But no ex­pert that I’ve spo­ken to on the topic thinks this will pre­vent China from ex­e­cut­ing a longer-term de­cou­pling from the US tech ecosys­tem. If any­thing, the re­stric­tions have only sped up China’s ef­forts to de­velop its own chip in­dus­try.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, the Chi­nese have been able to ac­cess things such as US patents, sci­en­tific pa­pers and even Amer­i­can cor­po­rate in­no­va­tions. That in­cludes ground-break­ing work on ar­ti­fi­cial in­tel­li­gence, some of which has been pub­lished or de­vel­oped open-source. This is hap­pen­ing at the same time as China’s own le­gal pro­tec­tions around things like in­tel­lec­tual prop­erty, and patents have been get­ting stronger by some mea­sures.</p>
    <p>That raises an in­ter­est­ing ques­tion: The US is still home to the most cut­ting-edge tech­no­log­i­cal in­no­va­tions, but which coun­try will be bet­ter at in­vent­ing the new thing in the fu­ture?</p>
    <p>You could ar­gue, as Chi­nese tech­nol­o­gist and ven­ture cap­i­tal­ist Kai-Fu Lee has, that it will be eas­ier for China to ramp up in­no­va­tion us­ing its ex­ist­ing re­sources, and slap its own con­sumer brands on prod­ucts churned out by an al­ready ro­bust and largely self-suf­fi­cient man­u­fac­tur­ing in­dus­try.</p>
    <p>Cer­tainly, it sounds sim­pler than what the US is now try­ing to do, which is re­build the sup­ply chains it has spent the past sev­eral decades out­sourc­ing to the East. That is the ad­van­tage of hav­ing a co­her­ent na­tional in­dus­trial pol­icy, as China does.</p>
    <p>The US aban­doned such plan­ning decades ago with the rise of ne­olib­er­al­ism, which held that cap­i­tal, goods and labour should flow freely with­out any gov­ern­ment re­stric­tion.</p>
    <p>The prob­lem is that the free-mar­ket-first ap­proach doesn’t work quite as well in a cri­sis. Right af­ter the pan­demic be­gan, for ex­am­ple, I in­ter­viewed the chief ex­ec­u­tives of numer­ous ap­parel com­pa­nies, who were ready and eager to re­tool to make masks in or­der to fill the short­age in hos­pi­tals.</p>
    <p>They were the ones prod­ding the White House to help them co­or­di­nate these ef­forts, rather than the other way around. No­body in the ad­min­is­tra­tion had a clue about what man­u­fac­tur­ing re­sources might be im­me­di­ately avail­able to fill the per­sonal pro­tec­tive equip­ment gaps, or how to bet­ter de­ploy them in a cri­sis.</p>
    <p>The Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion’s mis­han­dling of the pan­demic has, of course, been sin­gu­lar. But over the past few decades, US pol­i­cy­mak­ers have turned a blind eye as parts of the in­dus­trial sup­ply chain were out­sourced, down­sized or mo­nop­o­lised.</p>
    <p>They gave lit­tle thought to what the ram­i­fi­ca­tions might be in a time of emer­gency. The fo­cus on eco­nomic ef­fi­ciency rather than re­siliency led Amer­i­can com­pa­nies to re­trench in re­ces­sions with mass fir­ings, rather than use such pe­ri­ods to re­train and re­tool, as other coun­tries, most no­tably Ger­many, have done.</p>
    <p>That is why the eco­nomic tra­jec­to­ries of the US, China and Ger­many are so sim­i­lar now to what they were right af­ter the 2008 fi­nan­cial cri­sis. Then, as now, Ger­many fur­loughed work­ers, and en­joyed a V-shaped re­cov­ery, in part by grab­bing new busi­ness in Asia as China re­cov­ered.</p>
    <p>Chi­nese ex­ports surged back quickly in both time pe­ri­ods, thanks to quick and co­or­di­nated loans and fis­cal sup­port to small and large busi­nesses. The US, mean­while, lan­guished for years af­ter 2008 in a job­less re­cov­ery, which was fol­lowed by a flat pay cheque one.</p>
    <p>Now, the US looks like it is head­ing to­wards a deeper re­ces­sion. Per­haps that is why China de­cided to call Mr Trump’s bluff on Tik­Tok. Both coun­tries have tech­nolo­gies to pro­tect, and eco­nomic weapons to do that. But China’s im­me­di­ate fu­ture looks a bit brighter. De­cou­pling, it turns out, is a two-way street.</p>
