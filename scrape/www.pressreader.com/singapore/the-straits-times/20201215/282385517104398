    <p>PARIS • Hosts France will play three-time win­ners New Zealand in the stand­out match of the 2023 Rugby World Cup pool phase, af­ter the draw was made yesterday.</p>
    <p>The coun­tries have met each other seven times in World Cups, in­clud­ing in the 1987 and 2011 fi­nals, with the All Blacks win­ning on both oc­ca­sions.</p>
    <p>Italy and two qual­i­fiers, one from the Amer­i­cas and an­other from Africa, make up Pool A.</p>
    <p>Hold­ers South Africa will face Ire­land and 2003 cham­pi­ons Eng­land take on Ja­pan, which hosted the pre­vi­ous World Cup last year, and Ar­gentina, who beat New Zealand for the first time in their his­tory last month.</p>
    <p>“It’s ex­cit­ing, re­ally, to know who your RWC pool op­po­nents will be for the 2023 tour­na­ment in France,” Spring­boks cap­tain Siya Kolisi said.</p>
    <p>“For now, we have to turn our at­ten­tion to the mas­sive chal­lenge the Bri­tish and Ir­ish Lions will bring next year – there is huge an­tic­i­pa­tion, both at home and in the UK, for what prom­ises to be an­other mem­o­rable Lions se­ries in South Africa.”</p>
    <p>The Spring­boks will also go up against Scot­land and a side from Asia-Pa­cific and an­other Euro­pean na­tion in Pool B.</p>
    <p>Wales, who lost to South Africa in last year’s semi-fi­nals, are in Pool C with two-time Webb Ellis tro­phy win­ners Aus­tralia as well as Fiji, an­other Euro­pean team and the win­ner of the fi­nal qual­i­fy­ing tour­na­ment.</p>
    <p>A qual­i­fier each from Ocea­nia and the Amer­i­cas round out a com­pet­i­tive-look­ing Pool D with Eng­land, Ja­pan and Ar­gentina.</p>
    <p>Due to the coro­n­avirus pan­demic, seed­ings for the tour­na­ment draw were based on the world rank­ings on Jan 1 in­stead of af­ter the au­tumn in­ter­na­tion­als as orig­i­nally in­tended.</p>
    <p>Or­gan­is­ers also moved the event for­ward to be able to start selling tick­ets – which will be priced at €15 (S$24.30) for nonFrance matches and €30 for</p>
    <p>7</p>
    <p>Clashes be­tween France and New Zealand in pre­vi­ous Rugby World Cups.</p>
    <p>France games – in March, be­fore ticket sales for the 2024 Paris Olympics be­gin in 2022.</p>
    <p>The dozen coun­tries from the draw will be joined by eight qual­i­fiers, with the fi­nal line-up known by next Novem­ber.</p>
    <p>While the next edi­tion is nearly three years away, or­gan­is­ers have made plans to cover ev­ery even­tu­al­ity, in­clud­ing the pos­si­bil­ity Covid-19 may still be around then.</p>
    <p>“If in 2023 we are still un­sure if peo­ple will be back in sta­di­ums, we will have big­ger prob­lems than the Rugby World Cup. We do have can­cel­la­tion in­surance in the event of a pan­demic,” France 2023 chief ex­ec­u­tive of­fi­cer Claude Atcher said.</p>
    <p>How­ever, the French gov­ern­ment re­mains con­fi­dent the qua­dren­nial tour­na­ment will be played in a fes­tive at­mos­phere.</p>
    <p>Speak­ing at the cer­e­mony, which was held at the for­mer Paris Bourse, French Pres­i­dent Em­manuel Macron said: “France is a rugby-lov­ing coun­try. We are pre­par­ing for this event at a very tough time.</p>
    <p>“The na­tion is be­hind France. Ev­ery­one is suf­fer­ing at the mo­ment with us. The Covid-19 cri­sis is ter­ri­ble. In 2023, we want to of­fer the best of France; the French way of life – friend­li­ness, gas­tron­omy, par­ties and cul­ture.”</p>
