    <p>The coro­n­avirus pan­demic has greatly changed how global life in­sur­ers op­er­ate as they adopt more so­phis­ti­cated on­line tools, es­pe­cially in in­sur­ance buy­ing, un­der­writ­ing and ser­vic­ing pro­cesses.</p>
    <p>In­sur­ers have been forced to pivot to vir­tual modes and pro­cesses as the Covid-19 cri­sis brought face-to­face sales of prod­ucts and ser­vices to a screech­ing halt.</p>
    <p>Video­con­fer­enc­ing has be­come a widely used plat­form to con­nect with em­ploy­ees and dis­trib­u­tors for sales meet­ings, vir­tual mar­ket­ing, agent sem­i­nars and whole­sal­ing. Smart­phone apps have also been used to sell new poli­cies and dis­sem­i­nate health mes­sages in some parts of Asia.</p>
    <p>These were among the find­ings in a sur­vey on the global life in­sur­ance in­dus­try pub­lished on Tues­day by credit rat­ing agency Moody’s In­vestors Ser­vice. The sur­vey cov­ered 39 firms in North Amer­ica, the Asia-Pa­cific, Europe, the Mid­dle East, Africa and Latin Amer­ica.</p>
    <p>Moody’s vice-pres­i­dent Laura Bazer said tech­no­log­i­cally ad­vanced life in­sur­ers will likely emerge as win­ners from the cri­sis in terms of sales, rev­enue and profit growth over time.</p>
    <p>“The losers will be those with rigid prod­uct and busi­ness mod­els that fall tech­no­log­i­cally be­hind their peers. Although we do not ex­pect rat­ing changes due to tech­nol­ogy alone in the near term, firms that are the least tech-savvy will likely have weaker credit pro­files over time,” she said.</p>
    <p>In Sin­ga­pore, the in­dus­try has seen an in­crease in hir­ing for project and prod­uct man­age­ment roles, and an on­go­ing need for more dig­i­tal spe­cial­ists as in­sur­ers ac­cel­er­ate their dig­i­tal trans­for­ma­tion plans, the Life In­sur­ance As­so­ci­a­tion Sin­ga­pore told The Straits Times last month. The sec­tor has con­tin­ued to hire de­spite the down­turn, with 368 new hires in the first half of the year, a 4 per cent year-on-year in­crease, grow­ing the work­force to 8,650.</p>
    <p>Aviva Sin­ga­pore is among the in­sur­ers that have un­der­gone dig­i­tal trans­for­ma­tion re­cently, con­duct­ing dig­i­tal train­ing classes for its ad­vis­ers and equip­ping them with a fi­nan­cial needs anal­y­sis dig­i­tal tool, among other steps. “These new tools have made Aviva’s sales process 100 per cent dig­i­tal and we have also seen an uptick in non-face-to-face sales,” it told ST.</p>
    <p>AIA Sin­ga­pore is “en­hanc­ing our on­line cus­tomer ex­pe­ri­ence as more cus­tomers in­di­cate in­ter­est in sim­ple in­sur­ance prod­ucts that re­quire lit­tle or no med­i­cal un­der­writ­ing”, said Ms Tay Jin Li, head of prod­uct and funds de­vel­op­ment, im­ple­men­ta­tion and dis­tri­bu­tion.</p>
    <p>De­spite the ben­e­fits of dig­i­tal trans­for­ma­tion, new busi­ness prospect­ing and sales have been hin­dered by a lack of hu­man in­volve­ment, noted Moody’s. This is es­pe­cially the case for more com­plex prod­ucts, mar­kets that favour a more tra­di­tional face-to-face ap­proach, and younger in­sur­ance mar­kets that are less tech­no­log­i­cally ad­vanced to be­gin with.</p>
    <p>“When cou­pled with the global re­ces­sion, high un­em­ploy­ment and ul­tra-low in­ter­est rates, this means lower sales in 2020, and pos­si­bly for longer – a credit neg­a­tive for global life in­sur­ance rev­enue and profit,” it noted.</p>
    <p>Moody’s also found that un­der­writ­ing will con­tinue to move on­line, even af­ter the pan­demic ends, with the grow­ing adop­tion of e-sig­na­tures and e-pol­icy de­liv­ery. Bio­met­rics, such as face recog­ni­tion and fin­ger­prints, will in­creas­ingly fa­cil­i­tate e-de­liv­ery in cer­tain Asian mar­kets, it said.</p>
    <p>Work-from-home ar­range­ments have gen­er­ally been suc­cess­ful for global life in­sur­ers and will likely play a larger role post-Covid-19. “Many firms plan for a more ex­ten­sive, per­ma­nent use of these ar­range­ments, re­duc­ing real es­tate and op­er­at­ing costs, but also ex­pos­ing them to new data and se­cu­rity risks.”</p>
