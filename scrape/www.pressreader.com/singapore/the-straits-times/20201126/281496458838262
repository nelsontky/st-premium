    <p>As a key travel and tran­sit hub in the re­gion, Sin­ga­pore has scope to es­tab­lish it­self as a safe and se­cure meet­ing place for busi­nesses amid Covid-19, Trade and In­dus­try Min­is­ter Chan Chun Sing said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>“Who­ever can en­sure vis­i­tors’ health se­cu­rity in a faster and bet­ter way will gain a com­pet­i­tive ad­van­tage. Sin­ga­pore recog­nises this and has ev­ery in­ten­tion to be amongst the lead­ing lights in this area,” he said. “If we are able to build and op­er­a­tionalise these ca­pa­bil­i­ties, it will set us apart from many other com­peti­tors.”</p>
    <p>Speak­ing at the start of Trav­elRe­vive, a two-day travel event, at the Sands Expo and Con­ven­tion Cen­tre, he was out­lin­ing how Sin­ga­pore wants to po­si­tion it­self as a lead­ing Mice des­ti­na­tion in a time when busi­nesses may not be able to meet due to coro­n­avirus-re­lated travel re­stric­tions be­tween coun­tries.</p>
    <p>Trav­elRe­vive, or­gan­ised by Messe Ber­lin (Sin­ga­pore) and the Sin­ga­pore Tourism Board (STB), is the first trade show here to pi­lot new safety mea­sures un­der the newly de­vel­oped hy­brid event trade show pro­to­type for safe busi­ness events, safe itin­er­ar­ies and dig­i­tal en­abler tools.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, Mr Chan said Sin­ga­pore is “not go­ing to play de­fen­sive by just try­ing to get back to where we were” in the Mice space.</p>
    <p>Be­yond that, Sin­ga­pore wants to break new ground and es­tab­lish a new level of ex­pe­ri­ences that the coun­try can pro­vide.</p>
    <p>He said that the Repub­lic’s lack of a large lo­cal pop­u­la­tion and its re­liance on ex­ter­nal vis­i­tors mean that it can­not shut it­self off from the world, and needs to adopt a risk-man­age­ment rather than a risk-elim­i­na­tion ap­proach.</p>
    <p>While Sin­ga­pore had closed its bor­ders and im­posed travel re­stric­tions in the early days of the pan­demic for health and safety pur­poses, it now has the con­fi­dence to pro­gres­sively re­sume travel and con­nect with the rest of the world, Mr Chan said, cit­ing how Sin­ga­pore has stronger and more var­ied test­ing op­tions, as well as tighter con­tact trac­ing ca­pa­bil­i­ties.</p>
    <p>“How­ever, be­yond merely re­sum­ing travel in a safe and sus­tain­able man­ner, Sin­ga­pore is go­ing to pi­o­neer sev­eral things to lead the rein­ven­tion of global travel, es­pe­cially in the Mice in­dus­try,” he said.</p>
    <p>The grad­ual re­sump­tion of Mice events is one of seven ar­eas which in­dus­try-led coali­tion groups, con­vened by the Emerg­ing Stronger Task­force, are study­ing.</p>
    <p>The Al­liance for Ac­tion team that has been tasked with bring­ing back trav­ellers aims to take steps to re-es­tab­lish Sin­ga­pore’s lead as a Mice des­ti­na­tion and main­tain the coun­try’s po­si­tion as one of the top 10 ci­ties in the world by in­ter­na­tional vis­i­tor traf­fic.</p>
    <p>The Trav­elRe­vive hy­brid event, with its tri­als of Mice safety mea­sures, is in­tended to pave the way for more in­ter­na­tional trade shows to be held here in the first quar­ter of 2021.</p>
    <p>STB signed three mem­o­ran­dums of un­der­stand­ing with ex­hi­bi­tion or­gan­is­ers Fiera Mi­lano, Messe Mu­nich and In­forma Tech yes­ter­day. The one-year MOU with In­forma Tech and the In­fo­comm Me­dia De­vel­op­ment Author­ity will see In­forma Tech – which or­gan­ises the Lon­don Tech week – launch a new in­ter­na­tional tech­nol­ogy event in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>The event is cur­rently slated for the sec­ond half of 2021 and will bring to­gether in­dus­try stake­hold­ers to dis­cuss top­ics re­lated to in­no­va­tion and dig­i­tal trans­for­ma­tion in the tech sec­tor.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, both Fiera Mi­lano and Messe Mu­nich will be es­tab­lish­ing their South-east Asia re­gional head­quar­ters in Sin­ga­pore, to strengthen their links in Asean.</p>
    <p>“(The MOUs) demon­strate that global Mice com­pa­nies still re­tain con­fi­dence in Sin­ga­pore as the global Asia node, and are ex­pand­ing their pres­ence in the re­gion through part­ner­ships with our lo­cal play­ers,” Mr Chan said.</p>
    <p>As­so­ci­ate Pro­fes­sor Lawrence Loh from the Na­tional Univer­sity of Sin­ga­pore’s busi­ness school said “what is crit­i­cal now is to con­tinue the mo­men­tum in manag­ing the pan­demic sit­u­a­tion well lo­cally – this pull fac­tor will be the key dif­fer­en­ti­a­tion that sets Sin­ga­pore apart from com­pet­ing meet­ing lo­cal­i­ties”.</p>
    <p>As a key travel and tran­sit hub in the re­gion, Sin­ga­pore has scope to es­tab­lish it­self as a safe and se­cure meet­ing place for busi­nesses amid the pan­demic, Trade and In­dus­try Min­is­ter Chan Chun Sing said yes­ter­day. He was speak­ing at the start of Trav­elRe­vive, a two-day travel event, at the Sands Expo and Con­ven­tion Cen­tre.</p>
