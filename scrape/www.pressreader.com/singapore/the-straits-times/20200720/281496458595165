    <p>“We can say one thing: Rus­sia has noth­ing to do with these at­tempts; we do not ac­cept such ac­cu­sa­tions.”</p>
    <p>This was how the of­fi­cial spokesman for Rus­sia’s Pres­i­dent Vladimir Putin re­sponded last week to ac­cu­sa­tions from Bri­tain, Canada and the United States that Rus­sian spies were tar­get­ing phar­ma­ceu­ti­cal com­pa­nies and med­i­cal lab­o­ra­to­ries in Western coun­tries, with the aim of steal­ing re­search into a Covid-19 vac­cine.</p>
    <p>The de­nial was fully ex­pected; na­tions rarely own up to the ac­tiv­i­ties of their in­tel­li­gence ser­vices.</p>
    <p>But the real sur­prise is that some ob­servers were still sur­prised by such al­le­ga­tions. For the spy­ing out­fits of most coun­tries have been in the fore­front of the fight against the coro­n­avirus pan­demic right from the start of the cur­rent emer­gency.</p>
    <p>The bat­tle against Covid-19 is the new fron­tier for ev­ery self-re­spect­ing in­tel­li­gence agency around the world.</p>
    <p>And to­day’s James Bond is much more likely to be caught clutch­ing a lab­o­ra­tory sam­ple vial – prefer­ably nei­ther shaken, nor stirred – than a cool glass of mar­tini.</p>
    <p>The in­tel­li­gence agen­cies were, of course, the first state in­sti­tu­tions which raised the alarm about the on­set of the mys­te­ri­ous flu-like in­fec­tions which started ap­pear­ing in the Chi­nese city of Wuhan.</p>
    <p>Pre­cisely when that hap­pened and which in­tel­li­gence agency was first to re­port the on­set of the coro­n­avirus pan­demic re­main hotly dis­puted ques­tions.</p>
    <p>But it is al­ready ev­i­dent that the top Western in­tel­li­gence ser­vices – par­tic­u­larly those of Aus­tralia, Bri­tain, Canada, New Zealand and the United States grouped around the so-called Five Eyes ar­range­ment – alerted their po­lit­i­cal mas­ters about the on­set of the pan­demic from at least the mid­dle of De­cem­ber last year, weeks be­fore the Chi­nese gov­ern­ment ad­mit­ted that it faced a health emer­gency.</p>
    <p>MIS­SILES AND MI­CROBES</p>
    <p>It is also sig­nif­i­cant to note that, while the med­i­cal ser­vices and first aid or­gan­i­sa­tions of most coun­tries have yet to face a proper in­quiry into how pre­pared they were for the pan­demic and how well they bore the brunt of what fol­lowed, the world’s lead­ing in­tel­li­gence ser­vices have al­ready faced such a crit­i­cal scru­tiny from gov­ern­ments which ac­cused them of fail­ing to pro­vide ad­e­quate warn­ing.</p>
    <p>As is of­ten the case with al­leged “in­tel­li­gence fail­ures”, politi­cians tend to ac­cuse their spies of “fail­ing to con­nect the dots” by not alert­ing them early enough about the global sig­nif­i­cance of what were ini­tially iso­lated cases of in­fec­tion in a sec­ond-tier Chi­nese city, while the spooks re­ply that they sup­plied all the re­quired in­for­ma­tion, and that it wasn’t their fault that politi­cians failed to act on files pre­sented to them.</p>
    <p>Still, it is ob­vi­ous that most Western in­tel­li­gence agen­cies had lit­tle ex­per­tise and even less in­ter­est in iden­ti­fy­ing and track­ing erup­tions of lethal dis­eases and that this af­fected their abil­i­ties.</p>
    <p>Their spies sim­ply spent too much time try­ing to ac­quire the de­sign blue­prints of an op­po­nent’s mis­sile which may or may not prove to be a threat in years to come, and far too lit­tle in track­ing bi­o­log­i­cal pathogens which have the power to in­flict mas­sive and im­me­di­ate dam­age.</p>
    <p>The whole con­cept of what con­sti­tutes na­tional se­cu­rity and what should be a top tar­get for in­tel­li­gence ser­vices has been over­hauled be­cause of the Covid-19 ex­pe­ri­ence; the next head of Q-Branch, the gizmo-ob­sessed fic­tional re­search and de­vel­op­ment di­vi­sion of James Bond-movies fame, could well be an epi­demi­ol­o­gist.</p>
    <p>STA­TIS­TICS AND SUP­PLIES</p>
    <p>Yet, even be­fore these more pro­found, in­sti­tu­tional changes are im­ple­mented, the world’s ma­jor in­tel­li­gence agen­cies have al­ready trans­formed their ac­tiv­i­ties. As the coro­n­avirus spread, spies were busy try­ing to find out how other na­tions were far­ing in han­dling the pan­demic; the in­for­ma­tion was used to in­form de­ci­sion-mak­ers about the pos­si­bil­ity that some coun­tries may not be pub­lish­ing ac­cu­rate sta­tis­tics.</p>
    <p>But the most di­rect in­volve­ment of in­tel­li­gence ser­vices was in procur­ing health equip­ment such as masks, sur­gi­cal pro­tec­tive gear and dis­in­fec­tant gels, all of which were in crit­i­cally short sup­ply.</p>
    <p>The most spec­tac­u­lar – if only be­cause it is rel­a­tively well doc­u­mented – ex­am­ple of this is the in­volve­ment of the Mos­sad, Is­rael’s in­tel­li­gence ser­vice, not only in di­rect­ing med­i­cal sup­plies, of­ten by send­ing its agents to out­bid other gov­ern­ment con­trac­tors in or­der to snatch com­plete batches of equip­ment as they were leav­ing fac­to­ries, but also in ac­quir­ing the tech­ni­cal know-how and pro­duc­tion blue­prints of ven­ti­la­tors and other breath­ing ap­pa­ra­tus to treat crit­i­cally ill pa­tients.</p>
    <p>All of Mos­sad’s agents and col­lab­o­ra­tors were mo­bilised for this ef­fort, and Mr Yossi Co­hen, the Mos­sad boss, dealt di­rectly with the lead­ers of Is­rael’s hos­pi­tals in iden­ti­fy­ing their needs.</p>
    <p>No­body was there­fore sur­prised that, when Is­rael’s Health Min­is­ter fell ill with the coro­n­avirus, Mr Co­hen had to go into quar­an­tine as well; so close were the links be­tween a politi­cian and a chief spy. Nor was there much sur­prise when the Is­raeli gov­ern­ment an­nounced that Mr Co­hen’s ten­ure as Mos­sad chief, which was due to end this month, will be ex­tended by an­other year.</p>
    <p>The moral­ity of such stealthy ef­forts is, of course, de­bat­able. Yet, hun­dreds, if not thou­sands, of lives of Is­raelis may have been saved by Mos­sad’s ac­tions, and although other in­tel­li­gence ser­vices pre­fer to avoid Is­rael’s char­ac­ter­is­ti­cally ma­cho bravado on such mat­ters, they, too, were en­gaged in sim­i­lar ac­tiv­i­ties.</p>
    <p>Seen from this per­spec­tive, there­fore, the race to ac­quire or steal clin­i­cal in­for­ma­tion about the de­vel­op­ment of Covid-19 drugs and vac­cines is en­tirely pre­dictable.</p>
    <p>THE GREAT VAC­CINE RACE</p>
    <p>In May, Ira­nian hack­ers were caught try­ing to pen­e­trate the clin­i­cal data­bases of Gilead Sciences, the US-based pro­ducer of remde­sivir, a drug which may im­prove the sur­vival chances of crit­i­cally ill coro­n­avirus pa­tients.</p>
    <p>And a far more and in­tense in­ter­na­tional race is un­der way to track de­vel­op­ments of a vac­cine for the coro­n­avirus; an as­ton­ish­ing 155 vac­cines are reg­is­tered as un­der de­vel­op­ment, with about 25 of them be­ing tested on hu­mans.</p>
    <p>In the­ory, who­ever comes up first with the vac­cine is very likely to li­cense it to other na­tions, and pro­duc­tion is likely to take place in many coun­tries at the same time.</p>
    <p>Sci­en­tists at Ox­ford Univer­sity, now con­sid­ered to be in the fore­front of the search for a vac­cine in con­junc­tion with phar­ma­ceu­ti­cal gi­ant As­traZeneca, have al­ready teamed up with R-Pharm, a Rus­sian drugs com­pany based in Moscow, to pro­duce what­ever suc­cess­ful vac­cine emerges in Ox­ford for the Rus­sian pop­u­la­tion as well.</p>
    <p>That agree­ment is touted by the Rus­sian au­thor­i­ties as ev­i­dence that they did not need to spy on the Bri­tish univer­sity and its sci­en­tists.</p>
    <p>Sadly, the Rus­sian ar­gu­ment is un­per­sua­sive, for a va­ri­ety of rea­sons.</p>
    <p>First, there is no ques­tion that even if a vac­cine is found, it will be some time be­fore it will per­co­late down in suf­fi­cient quan­ti­ties to bil­lions of peo­ple around the world, re­gard­less of how many pro­duc­tion-shar­ing agree­ments are in place; that’s why the US has pledged to pay As­traZeneca</p>
    <p>US$1.2 bil­lion (S$1.67 bil­lion) up­front now, in re­turn for se­cur­ing 300 mil­lion doses of a po­ten­tial Ox­ford vac­cine.</p>
    <p>LIVES AT STAKE</p>
    <p>And the big­gest cur­rent night­mare for any head of gov­ern­ment in the world is the time lag be­tween the dis­cov­ery of the vac­cine and the avail­abil­ity of suf­fi­cient sup­plies to im­mu­nise the en­tire pop­u­la­tion.</p>
    <p>For, how would a leader be able to ex­plain to his or her peo­ple that they must con­tinue to die from the coro­n­avirus while oth­ers do not, sim­ply be­cause there are not enough vac­cines to go around?</p>
    <p>The abil­ity to have the vac­cine straight­away when­ever it comes on stream is now one of the top pri­or­i­ties for gov­ern­ments.</p>
    <p>And who can help in that re­spect more than one’s own spies?</p>
    <p>Fur­ther­more, key coun­tries which have their own ad­vanced vac­cine projects also want to know as early as pos­si­ble whether their tech­niques are likely to work, or whether their cur­rent re­search may turn out to be a waste of pre­cious time and money.</p>
    <p>Take, for in­stance, the fun­da­men­tal dis­tinc­tion be­tween the ef­forts of China and those of Western na­tions. In try­ing to de­velop a vac­cine, China’s Si­noPharm has in­vested in an older but well-es­tab­lished tech­nol­ogy: that of pro­duc­ing a so-called “in­ac­ti­vated” vac­cine made by grow­ing the whole virus in the lab and then killing it.</p>
    <p>How­ever, Western com­peti­tors use newer if less well-proven tech­nolo­gies tar­get­ing the pro­tein coat­ing of the virus to trig­ger off an im­mu­nity re­sponse.</p>
    <p>Wouldn’t China want to know early enough whether its line of in­quiry is doomed?</p>
    <p>And wouldn’t Western na­tions want to know whether the Chi­nese ap­proach is suc­cess­ful?</p>
    <p>Un­der nor­mal cir­cum­stances, such races were left to com­mer­cial con­fronta­tions be­tween in­di­vid­ual com­pa­nies. But the cur­rent pan­demic has il­lus­trated the im­por­tance of gov­ern­ment in­volve­ment in such bat­tles, and in­tel­li­gence agen­cies are just one com­po­nent of that en­deav­our.</p>
    <p>Ox­ford sci­en­tists are al­ready claim­ing that they have no­ticed a sur­pris­ing re­sem­blance be­tween their vac­cine ap­proach and what Rus­sian sci­en­tists say they are work­ing on.</p>
    <p>PO­LIT­I­CAL BOOSTER SHOT</p>
    <p>And if politi­cians are ter­ri­fied of see­ing their na­tions left be­hind in the race to ac­quire the vac­cine, just think of the huge tri­umph of be­ing the first na­tion to de­velop a vac­cine.</p>
    <p>If the first ef­fec­tive vac­cine emerges in China, not only would all the ques­tions about how the coro­n­avirus pan­demic started sim­ply van­ish, but China would also be able to claim that its sys­tem of gov­er­nance has con­clu­sively pro­vided its ef­fec­tive­ness.</p>
    <p>If, how­ever, the vac­cine emerges in the US, much of the crit­i­cism of Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump’s han­dling of the health cri­sis would fade away.</p>
    <p>And if the vac­cine comes out of the labs at Ox­ford Univer­sity, there is lit­tle doubt that Prime Min­is­ter Boris John­son will claim this as a tri­umph not only for Bri­tish sci­ence, but also for Bri­tain’s de­ci­sion to leave the Euro­pean Union, and much else be­sides.</p>
    <p>Of course, many of these claims would be far-fetched, if not out­right com­i­cal.</p>
    <p>But that is be­side the point, for, as far as politi­cians ev­ery­where are con­cerned, the dan­gers of be­ing left be­hind are sim­ply too huge, while the po­ten­tial advantages of be­ing the first are end­lessly al­lur­ing.</p>
    <p>And it must be said that Rus­sia’s spooks and cy­ber hack­ers may be jus­ti­fied in feel­ing put upon. For when it comes to this game, all in­tel­li­gence ser­vices – both those of friends and those of ad­ver­saries – are en­gaged in the same ac­tiv­ity.</p>
    <p>Ei­ther way, the race for the vac­cine re­sem­bles the race for the moon be­tween the US and the Soviet Union half a cen­tury ago.</p>
    <p>And it her­alds a long-term spy­ing in­ter­est in health sciences which will re­shape the pri­or­i­ties and the work of fu­ture gen­er­a­tions of spooks for per­haps an­other half cen­tury.</p>
