    <p>Ja­panese Prime Min­is­ter Yoshi­hide Suga de­clared a state of emer­gency in Tokyo and its three neigh­bour­ing pre­fec­tures yes­ter­day, amid a surge in the num­ber of coron­avirus in­fec­tions. The de­cree went into ef­fect at mid­night in Tokyo, Kana­gawa, Chiba and Saitama, and will be in ef­fect un­til Feb 7.</p>
    <p>Ja­panese Prime Min­is­ter Yoshi­hide Suga de­clared a state of emer­gency in Tokyo and its three neigh­bour­ing pre­fec­tures yes­ter­day, amid a surge in the num­ber of Covid-19 cases.</p>
    <p>The de­cree went into ef­fect at mid­night in Tokyo, Kana­gawa,</p>
    <p>Chiba and Saitama – which make up one of the world’s busiest met­ro­pol­i­tan ar­eas, with 36.8 mil­lion peo­ple – and will re­main un­til Feb 7.</p>
    <p>The na­tion­wide Go To Travel tourism cam­paign will be sus­pended un­til the same date.</p>
    <p>The tougher mea­sure came as Tokyo set a new one-day high of 2,447 fresh cases – a nearly 54 per cent jump from the pre­vi­ous record of 1,591 cases just a day ear­lier – with the num­ber of se­ri­ous cases ris­ing to a record 121.</p>
    <p>Kana­gawa, Saitama and Chiba also rewrote records with 679, 460 and 450 cases re­spec­tively.</p>
    <p>“The sit­u­a­tion has be­come in­creas­ingly trou­bling and we share a sense of height­ened cri­sis,” Mr Suga told a news con­fer­ence. “We must stop the in­fec­tions from spread­ing, hence this state of emer­gency, and we want ef­fec­tive and ef­fi­cient mea­sures in place.”</p>
    <p>He said that the du­ra­tion and scope of the state of emer­gency will be un­der re­view, and may be ex­tended or en­hanced if more ag­gres­sive mea­sures are thought to be re­quired.</p>
    <p>Ja­pan has been strug­gling to rein in its third wave of in­fec­tions. The cri­sis has in­ten­si­fied na­tion­wide, with at least 7,490 cases yes­ter­day – a new one-day high – as the num­ber of pa­tients in se­ri­ous con­di­tion hit a new record of 796.</p>
    <p>Mr Suga had been long re­luc­tant to call an emer­gency over fears of in­tractable eco­nomic prob­lems, with bank­rupt­cies and sui­cides soar­ing to new highs last year.</p>
    <p>The Labour Min­istry said yes­ter­day that more than 80,000 jobs had been lost in the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Rather than proac­tively seiz­ing the ini­tia­tive, the gov­ern­ment stuck to its guns even as early signs of a third wave be­came ev­i­dent last Novem­ber.</p>
    <p>It re­fused to take stronger ac­tion un­til me­dia polls showed the ap­proval rating for Mr Suga’s Cab­i­net nose­div­ing. The emer­gency de­cree fol­lowed a re­quest last Satur­day from gov­er­nors in the Greater Tokyo area for the na­tional gov­ern­ment to con­sider one.</p>
    <p>The de­cree has been dis­par­aged as too lit­tle, too late, and too half­hearted to rein in the out­break, with the Olympics less than 200 days away. Ex­perts ques­tioned its ef­fi­cacy, given the lim­ited scope.</p>
    <p>Noth­ing has been shut down, un­like dur­ing the first emer­gency from April 7 to May 25 last year.</p>
    <p>Rather, the de­cree takes aim at restau­rants and bars by ask­ing them to shut by 8pm – two hours ear­lier than the pre­vi­ous, largely ig­nored guide­line of 10pm – ex­cept for de­liv­ery and take­away ser­vices.</p>
    <p>Mr Suga cited ex­perts as say­ing that th­ese are “high-risk ar­eas”.</p>
    <p>While there are no le­gal means to im­pose penal­ties on non-com­pli­ant busi­nesses, Ja­pan will in­cen­tivise those that ad­here to the cur­few with 60,000 yen (S$767) a day, and name and shame those that do not.</p>
    <p>Events can still be held, but must be capped at ei­ther 5,000 peo­ple or half the venue’s ca­pac­ity, which­ever is lower.</p>
    <p>En­ter­tain­ment out­lets, depart­ment stores and sports venues can stay open but are en­cour­aged to close by 8pm, though without any promised in­cen­tives or penal­ties. Tokyo Dis­ney Re­sort, Ise­tan depart­ment store and Ginza Six shop­ping mall are among those that have said they will com­ply.</p>
    <p>Schools will stay open, with na­tional univer­sity en­trance ex­ams to go ahead as planned this month.</p>
    <p>Mr Suga said his goal was to re­duce move­ment by 70 per cent by en­cour­ag­ing the wider adop­tion of tele­work­ing, and for peo­ple to “ex­er­cise self-re­straint and re­frain from go­ing out af­ter 8pm for nonessen­tial out­ings”.</p>
    <p>Econ­omy Min­is­ter Ya­su­toshi Nishimura, Ja­pan’s point man for Covid-19 strat­egy, said ear­lier yes­ter­day that one in­di­ca­tor for lift­ing the state of emer­gency would be a re­duc­tion of Tokyo’s mov­ing one­week av­er­age of cases to be­low 500 in­fec­tions. The num­ber stood at 1,230 yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>To give emer­gency or­ders more bite, the gov­ern­ment is set to de­bate new laws to im­pose penal­ties on non-com­pli­ant busi­nesses. The Mainichi daily yes­ter­day cited sources as say­ing that those that flout guide­lines may face fines of up to 500,000 yen un­der the draft law.</p>
