    <p>Work­ing from home for ac­count ex­ec­u­tive Goh Wu Chong, 30, means sleep­ing in for one more hour in the morn­ing and jump­ing straight into gam­ing af­ter work.</p>
    <p>Mr Goh, who works at pub­lic re­la­tions agency Gloo, has been work­ing from home for about six months. He usu­ally spent 11/ hours a day</p>
    <p>2 pre­par­ing for work and com­mut­ing be­tween his home in Hougang and his of­fice at Odeon Tow­ers in City Hall on the bus and MRT. Not com­mut­ing means hav­ing more time for tasks and leisure af­ter work, he said.</p>
    <p>At first, he had to con­tend with is­sues such as not be­ing able to meet his col­leagues in per­son, set­ting up a proper home of­fice, and learn­ing how to “switch off” af­ter work.</p>
    <p>“I took small steps such as avoid­ing my bed­room af­ter work hours as it is my ‘of­fice’. I also stash away my work lap­top and ac­ces­sories af­ter work to help shift into an of­f­work mind­set,” he said.</p>
    <p>With reg­u­lar Zoom meet­ings, he “grew ac­cus­tomed to call­ing col­leagues to check in about work”.</p>
    <p>His com­pany has found work­ing from home to be a sus­tain­able ar­range­ment and down­sized the cowork­ing space that it is rent­ing.</p>
    <p>The of­fice is now be­ing used for stor­age, and Mr Goh said there are no plans to go back to it for now.</p>
    <p>For Web design firm FirstCom dig­i­tal mar­ket­ing lead Rochelle Ong, 27, sav­ing time from not hav­ing to com­mute to work has been the best part of work­ing from home.</p>
    <p>“I ap­pre­ci­ate the ad­di­tional rest time that I’m able to get,” said Ms Ong, who used to travel be­tween her home in Seran­goon and her of­fice in Kal­lang Way for about 1hr 15min each day on the MRT and bus.</p>
    <p>“There are no di­rect trans­port op­tions to get to my of­fice build­ing, so I need about a lit­tle over an hour to and fro,” she said.</p>
    <p>“At the start... I found my­self work­ing longer hours while at home due to the blurred line be­tween work and life,” she said.</p>
    <p>“As I got more ac­cus­tomed to it, I am now able to bet­ter jug­gle work and life hap­pen­ing con­cur­rently.”</p>
