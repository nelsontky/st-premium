    <p>The sim­plest el­e­ment in na­ture – hy­dro­gen – could help mankind solve one of its most com­plex prob­lems: cre­at­ing en­ergy that does not fuel cli­mate change.</p>
    <p>Hy­dro­gen is highly com­bustible and has long been used as a source of en­ergy. But it is ex­pen­sive to pro­duce in large vol­umes com­pared with cheaper fos­sil fu­els. And it is mainly pro­duced from nat­u­ral gas or coal, cre­at­ing large amounts of car­bon diox­ide (CO2), the main green­house gas heat­ing up the planet.</p>
    <p>Glob­ally, there is a grow­ing de­sire for cleaner fu­els. Hy­dro­gen is emerg­ing as part of the an­swer.</p>
    <p>An en­ergy rev­o­lu­tion is dawn­ing in which re­new­able en­ergy de­ployed at vast scale can create hy­dro­gen and am­mo­nia, an en­er­gy­dense chem­i­cal, in large vol­umes to power trucks and ships, gen­er­ate elec­tric­ity and cut car­bon emis­sions from steel and ce­ment pro­duc­tion.</p>
    <p>Hy­dro­gen when burned pro­duces wa­ter and no green­house gases. If used i n large enough amounts, it could sig­nif­i­cantly re­duce de­mand for fos­sil fu­els.</p>
    <p>“Green” hy­dro­gen is pro­duced us­ing so­lar, wind or hy­dro power to split wa­ter into oxy­gen and hy­dro­gen. “Blue” hy­dro­gen is cre­ated from nat­u­ral gas but the CO2 pro­duced in the process can be cap­tured, used or stored.</p>
    <p>Plung­ing re­new­able en­ergy costs and rapidly fall­ing prices of elec­trol­y­sers, the ma­chines that split wa­ter, are mak­ing the idea of cre­at­ing green hy­dro­gen fi­nan­cially vi­able in places where there is lots of sun and wind, such as Aus­tralia, Saudi Ara­bia and Chile.</p>
    <p>For now, green hy­dro­gen is still costly. But an­a­lysts say that could change over the next decade and al­ready, Aus­tralia, Ja­pan, Ger­many and other na­tions are back­ing the idea of a global hy­dro­gen econ­omy by cre­at­ing na­tional hy­dro­gen strate­gies.</p>
    <p>In Aus­tralia alone, there are about 30 projects, some more ad­vanced than oth­ers, that aim to pro­duce green hy­dro­gen for lo­cal use and to ex­port to en­ergy-hun­gry Asia.</p>
    <p>“The fac­tors driv­ing green hy­dro­gen are very low re­new­able en­ergy sup­ply costs and a de­sire to de­car­bonise en­ergy sup­plies,” said Pro­fes­sor Frank Jotzo at the Aus­tralian Na­tional Univer­sity’s Craw­ford School of Public Pol­icy.</p>
    <p>His team re­cently pro­duced an anal­y­sis on the pro­duc­tion costs and trends for green hy­dro­gen, and con­cluded that prices could fall quickly, even­tu­ally mak­ing it com­pet­i­tive with nat­u­ral gas.</p>
    <p>“Pro­duc­tion costs for green hy­dro­gen are cer­tain to fall over time, and may fall sub­stan­tially,” the re­port says, adding: “Pro­duc­tion at or be­low A$3 (S$2.90) per kg will be pos­si­ble soon or could al­ready be pos­si­ble, and green hy­dro­gen pro</p>
    <p>A CHEAPER OP­TION</p>
    <p>duc­tion costs in the vicin­ity of A$2 per kg may well come within reach in com­ing years.”</p>
    <p>The Aus­tralian gov­ern­ment has set a sub-A$2 per kg tar­get for pro­duc­tion costs un­der its cur­rent hy­dro­gen strat­egy.</p>
    <p>“Over­all, we would ex­pect green hy­dro­gen to be the cheaper op­tion for hy­dro­gen within the space of a decade in gen­eral terms,” Prof Jotzo told The Straits Times.</p>
    <p>“That opens up tremen­dous op­por­tu­ni­ties for zero-emis­sions fuel – for ex­am­ple, fuel cells for heavy trans­port,” he said, adding that they have very im­por­tant ap­pli­ca­tions in in­dus­try. “You can re­place gas in many ap­pli­ca­tions in in­dus­try.”</p>
    <p>The key for cheaper green hy­dro­gen is scale.</p>
    <p>Near the north-west coast of Western Aus­tralia, the de­vel­op­ers of the planned Asian Re­new­able En­ergy Hub – a con­sor­tium largely led by Aus­tralia’s CWP Re­new­ables and Hong Kong-based In­ter­con­ti­nen­tal En­ergy – want to create the world’s largest power sta­tion us­ing so­lar and wind. The to­tal area of the pro­ject is 6,500 sq km, or nine times the area of Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>Ear­lier this month, the Western Aus­tralian gov­ern­ment granted en­vi­ron­men­tal ap­proval for the first stage of the pro­ject, to be sited north-east of Port Hed­land. If fully ap­proved, the pro­ject would gen­er­ate 26 gi­gawatts of elec­tric­ity and pro­duce 1.8 mil­lion tonnes of hy­dro­gen per year – a frac­tion of pro­jected global hy­dro­gen de­mand by 2040.</p>
    <p>The de­vel­op­ers plan to ex­port a large por­tion of that hy­dro­gen to Asia in the form of green am­mo­nia, which is cre­ated as an ex­tra step dur­ing the ex­trac­tion of hy­dro­gen from wa­ter. Am­mo­nia is cheaper and eas­ier to trans­port than chilled liq­uid hy­dro­gen.</p>
    <p>Nor­mally, am­mo­nia is pro­duced us­ing nat­u­ral gas and is a key in­gre­di­ent in fer­tilis­ers. Green am­mo­nia pro­duced us­ing re­new­able en­ergy could dis­place nat­u­ral gas and cut car­bon emis­sions.</p>
    <p>Green am­mo­nia could also be used as a fuel, and plans are un­der­way to de­velop en­gines in ships and lo­co­mo­tives that use am­mo­nia, in­stead of pol­lut­ing diesel. It is also pos­si­ble to ex­tract the hy­dro­gen from green am­mo­nia, though this re­quires ex­tra en­ergy.</p>
    <p>THE SIN­GA­PORE CON­NEC­TION</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore is look­ing very closely at hy­dro­gen, green and blue, as part of the na­tional strat­egy to create a low-car­bon econ­omy, ac­cord­ing Mr Damian Chan, ex­ec­u­tive vi­cepres­i­dent of the Eco­nomic Devel­op­ment Board (EDB).</p>
    <p>He told ST that the EDB, Na­tional Cli­mate Change Sec­re­tariat and En­ergy Mar­ket Au­thor­ity have iden­ti­fied blue and green hy­dro­gen as a po­ten­tial growth area and en­ergy source for Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>The EDB is also in dis­cus­sion with com­pa­nies and oth­ers to ex­plore the adop­tion of the lat­est low-car­bon hy­dro­gen tech­nolo­gies and ap­pli­ca­tions in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>“Th­ese ini­tia­tives, while still in the early stages of dis­cus­sion, have the po­ten­tial to scale up in fu­ture,” he added.</p>
    <p>Re­search is be­ing done on liq­uid or­ganic hy­dro­gen car­ri­ers, for in­stance. One sys­tem fixes hy­dro­gen to toluene, which is then con­verted to methyl­cy­clo­hex­ane (MCH) that can be trans­ported as a liq­uid at nor­mal tem­per­a­tures and at­mo­spheric pres­sure. At the des­ti­na­tion, the hy­dro­gen could be re­leased from the MCH via a chem­i­cal process us­ing a cat­a­lyst, said Pro­fes­sor Chan Siew Hwa, a hy­dro­gen ex­pert and Pres­i­dent’s Chair in En­ergy at Nanyang Tech­no­log­i­cal Univer­sity.</p>
    <p>He said im­port­ing other hy­dro­gen car­ri­ers, such as am­mo­nia plus liq­uid hy­dro­gen, into Sin­ga­pore could be re­alised to­wards and be­yond 2030.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore’s Na­tional Re­search Foun­da­tion (NRF) also sees hy­dro­gen as po­ten­tially a key part of Sin­ga­pore’s econ­omy, in­clud­ing cap­tur­ing and us­ing the CO2 pro­duced dur­ing the ex­trac­tion of hy­dro­gen from nat­u­ral gas.</p>
    <p>“The shift to a hy­dro­gen econ­omy is in­evitable – it is one of the nec­es­sary steps to­wards re­duc­ing our car­bon foot­print,” said Dr Yeoh Lean Weng, se­nior direc­tor of the NRF’s Ur­ban So­lu­tions and Sus­tain­abil­ity di­vi­sion.</p>
    <p>“That is the nat­u­ral pro­gres­sion. The whole world is mov­ing in that di­rec­tion and if you don’t move along you will be left be­hind.”</p>
    <p>Over­all, we would ex­pect green hy­dro­gen to be the cheaper op­tion for hy­dro­gen within the space of a decade in gen­eral terms. That opens up tremen­dous op­por­tu­ni­ties for zero-emis­sions fuel – for ex­am­ple, fuel cells for heavy trans­port.</p>
