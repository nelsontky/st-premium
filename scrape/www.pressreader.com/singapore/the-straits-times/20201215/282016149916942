    <p>Be­sides lead­ing Singapore’s Covid-19 ef­fort at the Na­tional Cen­tre for In­fec­tious Diseases, Pro­fes­sor Leo Yee Sin also keeps her­self up­dated on mea­sures put in place at army camps to curb the spread of such diseases.</p>
    <p>Since Jan­uary, she has been vol­un­teer­ing as the chair­man of the Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) In­fec­tious Diseases Spe­cial­ist Ad­vi­sory Board.</p>
    <p>The board is one of 42 Min­istry of De­fence (Min­def) boards and com­mit­tees seek­ing to en­gage ex­ter­nal ex­perts to al­low the min­istry to stay up­dated on the best prac­tices in dif­fer­ent in­dus­tries, from medicine to law to en­gi­neer­ing.</p>
    <p>While Min­def has over the years strength­ened its ca­pa­bil­i­ties in ar­eas such as sur­veil­lance, de­tec­tion and re­sponse, and there has been no Covid-19 out­break in camps so far, there is no room for com­pla­cency, said Prof Leo, 61.</p>
    <p>“I think all of us are very glad that the years of strength­en­ing the abil­ity to do pre­ven­tion and re­sponse bear out in terms of the chal­lenge by Covid-19... But we still need to strengthen this,” she told re­porters last week, adding that there will be new viruses in the fu­ture that will chal­lenge hu­mankind.</p>
    <p>Prof Leo is among 331 vol­un­teers serv­ing on the 42 Min­def boards and com­mit­tees to whom De­fence Min­is­ter Ng Eng Hen has writ­ten let­ters of ap­pre­ci­a­tion.</p>
    <p>But an an­nual din­ner to recog­nise their con­tri­bu­tions will not take place this year due to Covid-19 re­stric­tions, Min­def said in a state­ment yesterday.</p>
    <p>This year, 212 ap­point­ment and reap­point­ment cer­tifi­cates and let­ters will be de­liv­ered to the Min­def vol­un­teers.</p>
    <p>Th­ese vol­un­teers, who are in­dus­try ex­perts in both the pri­vate and pub­lic sec­tors, also link the min­istry and the pub­lic by pro­mot­ing pub­lic aware­ness of de­fence and in­spir­ing sup­port for na­tional ser­vice, said Min­def.</p>
    <p>Dr Ng wrote in the let­ters that vol­un­teers play cru­cial roles in strength­en­ing na­tional de­fence, and their ex­per­tise and ex­pe­ri­ence fill gaps in Min­def’s ca­pa­bil­i­ties.</p>
    <p>“The peace and se­cu­rity that Sin­ga­pore­ans en­joy are a re­sult of your ef­forts to strengthen the SAF,” he said.</p>
    <p>An­other of the vol­un­teers is Ad­junct As­so­ciate Pro­fes­sor Lee Cheng, 54, chair­man of the SAF Psy­chi­a­try Spe­cial­ist Ad­vi­sory Board and a psy­chi­a­trist at the In­sti­tute of Men­tal Health, who be­lieves that the emo­tional and men­tal health of ser­vice­men is no less im­por­tant than the phys­i­cal as­pect.</p>
    <p>The board’s work in­cludes en­sur­ing that na­tional ser­vice­men who have psy­chi­atric con­di­tions but</p>
    <p>are still able to serve are given suit­able Phys­i­cal Em­ploy­ment Stan­dards, which de­ter­mine the roles that ser­vice­men can take on dur­ing na­tional ser­vice.</p>
    <p>“We have ser­vice­men who may have emo­tional dis­tress but are still very keen to serve, be­cause they feel that this is also a test of their re­silience and abil­ity to cope,” Prof Lee said.</p>
    <p>Ac­coun­tant Sel­vam Varathap­pan, 62, a mem­ber of the Board of Vis­i­tors to the SAF De­ten­tion Bar­racks, said his ex­pe­ri­ence has given him a dif­fer­ent per­spec­tive on the dif­fi­cul­ties that some ser­vice­men face.</p>
    <p>The board visits the de­ten­tion bar­racks once a month to lis­ten to feed­back from de­tainees and check on their liv­ing con­di­tions, although Mr Sel­vam – who has vol­un­teered for about six years – is ros­tered once a year.</p>
    <p>He said that for cer­tain of­fences, such as be­ing ab­sent with­out of­fi­cial leave, some did so not be­cause they wanted to run away, but be­cause they had to work two or three jobs to pro­vide for their fam­ily.</p>
    <p>Of his ex­pe­ri­ence lis­ten­ing to de­tainees, he said: “I re­alise that this is a side of Singapore that we may not have come across. I ac­tu­ally look for­ward to help­ing out ev­ery year.”</p>
