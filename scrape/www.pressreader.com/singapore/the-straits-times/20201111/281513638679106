    <p>Prime Min­is­ter Muhyid­din Yassin may have to wait a year to call polls that are needed to end Malaysia’s roil­ing po­lit­i­cal un­cer­tainty, which has dogged him since he took power in March.</p>
    <p>The Parti Pribumi Ber­satu Malaysia pres­i­dent was set to cap­i­talise on the mo­men­tum of wrest­ing con­trol of Sabah from Parti Warisan Sabah in Septem­ber, but the record num­ber of Covid-19 cases that in large part stemmed from the elec­tion cam­paign in the state has put paid to such plans, likely un­til the end of next year.</p>
    <p>Of­fi­cial sources told The Straits Times that the health au­thor­i­ties be­lieve it will take nearly a year to curb the third wave of in­fec­tions – which has nearly quadru­pled Malaysia’s to­tal cases since the Sept 26 Sabah vote – and re­turn to the low dou­ble dig­its seen three months af­ter move­ment curbs were in­tro­duced in March.</p>
    <p>A record high of 1,755 new cases were logged last Fri­day.</p>
    <p>“PM still wants to go for polls as he said dur­ing the Sabah cam­paign. But in the Na­tional Se­cu­rity Coun­cil, he was ad­vised to in­voke a state of emer­gency to avoid any elec­tion, as data in­di­cated the third wave could last un­til Oc­to­ber 2021,” said a source.</p>
    <p>Tan Sri Muhyid­din’s bid to claim emer­gency pow­ers – which would let the gov­ern­ment de­lay a Dec 5 by-elec­tion in Sabah as well as polls in neigh­bour­ing Sarawak due in mid-2021 – was re­jected last month by Malaysia’s King, Sul­tan Ab­dul­lah Ah­mad Shah.</p>
    <p>Fresh polls are not due un­til 2023 and the rul­ing Perikatan Na­sional (PN) coali­tion has yet to agree to an elec­toral pact or fi­nalise seat al­lo­ca­tions and can­di­dates. None­the­less, Mr Muhyid­din was will­ing to risk over­lap­ping clashes among his al­lies to gain a stronger man­date, in­stead of con­tin­u­ing to tus­sle with dis­grun­tled lead­ers in Umno to keep his ra­zor-thin ma­jor­ity in the 222-mem­ber Par­lia­ment.</p>
    <p>Umno, the largest party in the PN gov­ern­ment with 39 of the coali­tion’s 113 par­lia­men­tary seats, is de­mand­ing var­i­ous con­ces­sions, in­clud­ing the deputy premier­ship in a reshuf­fle of the Cab­i­net, where it largely holds ju­nior port­fo­lios.</p>
    <p>Fur­ther en­raged by hav­ing to cede the chief min­is­ter­ship of Sabah to Ber­satu, it threat­ened last month to pull its sup­port for Mr Muhyid­din, al­though his back­ers be­lieve his cur­rent pop­u­lar­ity will be enough to swing an elec­tion.</p>
    <p>The last poll by the re­spected Merdeka Cen­tre in Au­gust showed the Prime Min­is­ter’s ap­proval at a high 69 per cent, largely due to the gov­ern­ment’s Covid-19 han­dling.</p>
    <p>Fi­nance Min­is­ter Tengku Zafrul Aziz tabled PN’s first bud­get last Fri­day, with the RM322.5 bil­lion (S$105 bil­lion) in spend­ing mak­ing it the largest in Malaysian his­tory.</p>
    <p>Mr Muhyid­din has de­nied it is an elec­tion bud­get. “When is the elec­tion? I don’t know,” he said last Wed­nes­day. He said that if the pan­demic and eco­nomic slump were re­solved, “I re­ally hope we would get a new man­date”.</p>
    <p>But the sil­ver lin­ing for Mr Muhyid­din is that Umno pres­i­dent Ah­mad Zahid Hamidi, whose fac­tion is most ag­grieved at be­ing side­lined, will face two ob­sta­cles next year to re­tain­ing con­trol of the once dom­i­nant Malay party: a party lead­er­ship elec­tion, and a ver­dict in his graft trial.</p>
    <p>Umno polls are due by next June, al­though its supreme coun­cil, its high­est de­ci­sion-mak­ing body, can or­der a de­lay of up to 18 months.</p>
    <p>Zahid leads a di­vided Umno, with a sig­nif­i­cant num­ber of its MPs loyal to Mr Muhyid­din.</p>
    <p>Zahid is also fac­ing 47 graft charges lev­elled against him a year ago, and would be dis­qual­i­fied from re-elec­tion if con­victed. The case has faced sev­eral de­lays due to virus-in­duced move­ment curbs.</p>
    <p>Fur­ther, his flir­ta­tions with op­po­si­tion leader An­war Ibrahim as lever­age against Mr Muhyid­din have led to a back­lash from PN part­ners Ber­satu and Parti Is­lam SeMalaysia (PAS), as well as among the Umno grass­roots. They are un­will­ing to work with Datuk Seri An­war and the Demo­cratic Ac­tion Party, the largest ally in his Pakatan Hara­pan pact which they ac­cuse of mas­ter­mind­ing an agenda to un­der­mine Malay-Mus­lim in­ter­ests.</p>
    <p>ST has also learnt that Umno and PAS are at log­ger­heads in north­ern states where the Is­lamist party is dom­i­nant. It would be less than ideal for PN should Umno carry out its threat to break away from the Barisan Na­sional (BN) coali­tion and clash with other rul­ing par­ties. BN is led by Umno and has three other par­ties as mem­bers.</p>
    <p>This could play into Ber­satu’s hands, as the ma­jor over­laps in PN seat ne­go­ti­a­tions are among the three par­ties which are vy­ing for the same con­stituents – eth­nic Malays who make up the ma­jor­ity in more than half of Malaysia’s par­lia­men­tary wards.</p>
    <p>“Never in his­tory has Umno not con­tested the most seats across the penin­sula, and its war­lords will be un­happy at hav­ing to cede con­stituen­cies they have al­ways con­tested. But Ber­satu and PAS are a good fit as their core sup­ports are con­cen­trated in dif­fer­ent ar­eas,” a north­ern Ber­satu leader said.</p>
    <p>The dis­pute has been es­pe­cially heated in Tereng­ganu – which PAS wrested from Umno at the 2018 gen­eral elec­tion – where Umno has com­plained of be­ing side­lined by the PAS state gov­ern­ment de­spite the Muafakat Na­sional (Na­tional Con­sen­sus) deal they inked last year to fur­ther Malay-Mus­lim in­ter­ests.</p>
    <p>“We talk about Muafakat. At the na­tional level there is Muafakat but at the state level? Muafakat is not hap­pen­ing here,” said Umno state chief and for­mer Men­teri Be­sar Ah­mad Said.</p>
    <p>PAS lead­ers, in­clud­ing Tereng­ganu Chief Min­is­ter Ah­mad Sam­suri Mokhtar, have said in re­cent months they will de­fend six of the eight par­lia­men­tary wards and 22 of the 32 state assem­bly seats it won two years ago. This led to Datuk Seri Ah­mad claim­ing Umno will con­test all ar­eas in the state in the com­ing elec­tion.</p>
    <p>Ber­satu re­sponded by ac­cept­ing that PAS will take the most seats in Tereng­ganu, a con­ces­sion that</p>
    <p>PAS pres­i­dent Ab­dul Hadi Awang grasped by declar­ing in Septem­ber his party will con­test the ma­jor­ity of seats not just in Tereng­ganu, but in neigh­bour­ing Ke­lan­tan and Kedah as well.</p>
