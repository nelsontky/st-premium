    <p>Liver­pool man­ager Jur­gen Klopp branded the de­ci­sion to not ex­tend the use of five sub­sti­tutes in the Premier League as a lack of com­mon sense as he voiced his con­cerns for player wel­fare in a con­gested sea­son.</p>
    <p>The Reds be­gin the de­fence of their Premier League ti­tle at home to Leeds to­day, in a cam­paign that is start­ing a month later than nor­mal due to the three-month halt to last sea­son caused by the coronaviru­s pandemic. Both Cup com­pe­ti­tions in Eng­land have been re­tained, while Liver­pool are among the clubs who will face six Cham­pi­ons League group games in seven weeks be­tween late next month and early De­cem­ber.</p>
    <p>De­spite the fix­ture pile-up, the Premier League has not fol­lowed the ex­am­ple of other ma­jor Euro­pean leagues in ex­tend­ing a tem­po­rary rule af­ter the re­sump­tion of last sea­son. The rule al­lowed match­day squads to in­crease from 18 to 20 and man­agers to make five sub­sti­tu­tions in­stead of three.</p>
    <p>“We press a nor­mal sea­son into a shorter pe­riod which will be a proper chal­lenge, es­pe­cially with the won­der­ful rule we set up with 18 (play­ers) and three (sub­sti­tutes),” Klopp said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>“It’s only about player wel­fare, noth­ing else, but I don’t know why we have to dis­cuss it at all and not ev­ery­body says yes of course, like the whole world is do­ing, at least the whole of Europe!”</p>
    <p>Two votes on the rule found a ma­jor­ity of Premier League clubs were against the rule be­ing ex­tended, with those nearer the bot­tom of the ta­ble fear­ing it gave the big­ger clubs with bet­ter squads an even greater ad­van­tage.</p>
    <p>“I thought from a com­mon sense point of view that for this year, only this year not for­ever, that we would have 20 and five,” added the Ger­man. “It is not about hav­ing ad­van­tages, it is about player wel­fare and about hav­ing the high­est qual­ity in the games for all teams.”</p>
    <p>Liver­pool do not have the deep­est of squads while Klopp favours us­ing a core group of play­ers, with just 24 utilised en route to last sea­son’s ti­tle win.</p>
    <p>The club also adopted a cau­tious ap­proach in the trans­fer mar­ket, given the fi­nan­cial fall-out from the coronaviru­s and their only ad­di­tion to date is Greek left-back Kostas Tsimikas.</p>
    <p>Manch­ester City, Chelsea and Manch­ester United have all sought to strengthen their squads, with the Blues in­vest­ing al­most £200 mil­lion (S$350 mil­lion).</p>
    <p>But Klopp warned their ri­vals that splash­ing out on new faces is no guar­an­tee of success.</p>
    <p>“For some clubs it seems less im­por­tant how un­cer­tain the fu­ture is: those owned by coun­tries, owned by oli­garchs,” the Ger­man told the BBC.</p>
    <p>“We can­not just change it overnight and say, ‘So now we want to be­have like Chelsea’. Now they are sign­ing a lot of play­ers. That can be an ad­van­tage of course but that means they have to fit to­gether pretty quickly as well.”</p>
    <p>He also had a note of cau­tion for his team, know­ing they can­not look fur­ther ahead than the visit of a Leeds side re­turn­ing to the Premier League for the first time in 16 years.</p>
    <p>“They are well drilled and the way they de­fend is ex­cep­tional, pretty much man-mark­ing plus one,” he said.</p>
    <p>Liver­pool will await late fit­ness tests for cap­tain Jor­dan Henderson and Xher­dan Shaqiri. Both have re­turned to train­ing with the team.</p>
    <p>Leeds are with­out in­jured duo Gae­tano Ber­ardi and Adam For­shaw.</p>
    <p>Marcelo Bielsa, who signed a oneyear ex­ten­sion yes­ter­day, is ea­ger to see how his side will fare in the Premier League.</p>
    <p>“We have pre­pared but we need to show it on the pitch,” he said. “We have been form­ing a group for some time and we have kept play­ers we be­lieve can play at a higher level.”</p>
    <p>I thought from a com­mon sense point of view that for this year, only this year not for­ever, that we would have 20 (play­ers) and five (sub­sti­tutes).</p>
