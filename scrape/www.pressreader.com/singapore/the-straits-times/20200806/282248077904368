    <p>The Na­tional Wages Coun­cil (NWC) will re­con­vene this year, to look at re­vis­ing its an­nual wage guide­lines as the Covid-19 pan­demic roils the labour mar­ket. It is only the fourth time since its for­ma­tion in 1972 that it will be con­vened twice in the same year. Man­power Cor­re­spon­dent Joanna Seow high­lights five things to note about the coun­cil. 1. TRI­PAR­TITE MEM­BER­SHIP</p>
    <p>Com­pris­ing gov­ern­ment, em­ployer and union rep­re­sen­ta­tives, the coun­cil’s com­po­si­tion can change from year to year, and is typ­i­cally re­vealed along with the an­nounce­ment of it be­ing con­vened.</p>
    <p>Mr Peter Seah, chair­man of DBS Bank and Sin­ga­pore Air­lines, is the cur­rent chair­man. He took over in 2015 from Pro­fes­sor Lim Pin, who helmed it from 2001 to 2014.</p>
    <p>There were 21 other mem­bers in March this year.</p>
    <p>From the em­ploy­ers’ group, there were Sin­ga­pore Na­tional Em­ploy­ers Fed­er­a­tion pres­i­dent Robert Yap, Sin­ga­pore Busi­ness Fed­er­a­tion vice-chair­man Gan Seow Kee, and five busi­ness cham­ber lead­ers.</p>
    <p>Work­ers were rep­re­sented by Na­tional Trades Union Con­gress pres­i­dent Mary Liew and as­sis­tant sec­re­tary-gen­eral Des­mond Choo, as well as five other union lead­ers.</p>
    <p>The gov­ern­ment group was made up of Per­ma­nent Sec­re­tary for Man­power Aubeck Kam, Per­ma­nent Sec­re­tary for Trade and In­dus­try Gabriel Lim and five other se­nior pub­lic ser­vants.</p>
    <p>2. TACK­LING WAGES, EM­PLOY­MENT</p>
    <p>The coun­cil’s rec­om­men­da­tions cover wage ad­just­ments as well as other em­ploy­ment is­sues.</p>
    <p>The lat­est guide­lines in March urged com­pa­nies to first re­duce non-wage costs and tap gov­ern­ment sup­port be­fore look­ing to re­duce their work­ers’ wages. Re­trench­ment should be a last re­sort.</p>
    <p>The NWC also said the monthly vari­able com­po­nent (MVC) of salaries can be ad­justed first if the em­ployer can­not wait un­til the end of the year to ad­just an­nual vari­able parts of pay. But em­ploy­ers should set clear guide­lines on re­vers­ing any re­duc­tions to MVC or ba­sic salary when busi­ness re­cov­ers.</p>
    <p>Over the years, the coun­cil has em­pha­sised the im­por­tance of in­clud­ing an MVC in the ba­sic wage struc­ture so that com­pa­nies can re­spond to eco­nomic con­di­tions quickly, with a view to restor­ing the cuts when busi­ness im­proves.</p>
    <p>It has also paid spe­cial at­ten­tion to low-wage work­ers. In 2012, it spec­i­fied that work­ers with ba­sic monthly pay of up to $1,000 should have a built-in in­crease of at least $50. That was the first time in nearly three decades that the coun­cil had spelt out a pay-rise quan­tum, a prac­tice it has con­tin­ued since then, giv­ing a range in some years.</p>
    <p>The salary ceil­ing for the rec­om­men­da­tions for low-wage work­ers has risen.</p>
    <p>This year, the NWC said that for work­ers earn­ing up to $1,400 a month, em­ploy­ers should freeze their pay rather than cut it, if there are com­pany-wide wage cuts, while if a wage freeze or in­crease is planned, em­ploy­ers should con­sider giv­ing low-wage work­ers a built-in wage in­crease of up to $50.</p>
    <p>The coun­cil has also com­mented over the years on is­sues such as rais­ing pro­duc­tiv­ity, en­sur­ing in­clu­sive growth and rais­ing the re­tire­ment age.</p>
    <p>3. GUIDE­LINES NOT COM­PUL­SORY</p>
    <p>NWC guide­lines ap­ply to all em­ploy­ees – pro­fes­sion­als, man­agers, ex­ec­u­tives, tech­ni­cians and rank-and­file em­ploy­ees, in unionised and non-unionised com­pa­nies, in both the pub­lic and pri­vate sec­tors.</p>
    <p>They also ap­ply to re-em­ployed em­ploy­ees.</p>
    <p>But they are not legally bind­ing. The Gov­ern­ment has al­ways ac­cepted the rec­om­men­da­tions, and the pub­lic sec­tor ad­heres to them.</p>
    <p>The ma­jor­ity of pri­vate com­pa­nies fol­low suit. Last year, the NWC urged com­pa­nies to raise the monthly salaries of low-wage work­ers earn­ing a ba­sic monthly pay of up to $1,400, by be­tween $50 and $70. A to­tal of 60.1 per cent of pri­vate sec­tor es­tab­lish­ments with at least 10 em­ploy­ees did so, ac­cord­ing to Min­istry of Man­power data.</p>
    <p>4. TWO MONTHS OF DE­LIB­ER­A­TIONS – USU­ALLY</p>
    <p>The coun­cil’s work was ex­pe­dited this year ow­ing to the un­cer­tainty caused by Covid-19. It was con­vened on March 17 and re­leased its rec­om­men­da­tions on March 30.</p>
    <p>Man­power Min­is­ter Josephine Teo said the coun­cil was able to achieve a tri­par­tite con­sen­sus within 10 days. Feed­back from the pub­lic is usu­ally sought by the coun­cil be­fore it meets.</p>
    <p>5. CRI­SIS RE­SPONSE</p>
    <p>The last three times the NWC was con­vened twice in the same year were also dur­ing eco­nomic crises.</p>
    <p>It re­leased re­vised rec­om­men­da­tions in 1998, ow­ing to the Asian fi­nan­cial cri­sis; in 2001, af­ter the Sept 11 at­tacks in the United States; and in 2009, amid the global fi­nan­cial cri­sis.</p>
    <p>In Novem­ber 1998, it pro­posed, among other things, that in ad­di­tion to a 10 per­cent­age point cut to em­ploy­ers’ Cen­tral Prov­i­dent Fund con­tri­bu­tions, to­tal wages for the year be cut by 5 per cent to 8 per cent, as com­pared with 1997.</p>
    <p>The em­ploy­ers’ con­tri­bu­tion rate should be ad­justed up­wards when the econ­omy re­cov­ered, it said.</p>
    <p>In De­cem­ber 2001, the NWC re­frained from sug­gest­ing spe­cific num­bers for wage cuts, and in­stead called for “se­vere wage re­straint”.</p>
    <p>It said the ma­jor­ity of com­pa­nies that were badly af­fected by the se­vere eco­nomic down­turn could, in con­sul­ta­tion with their unions or work­ers, freeze or cut wages, with bosses lead­ing by ex­am­ple. But those that were per­form­ing well should still re­ward work­ers.</p>
    <p>In Jan­uary 2009, the coun­cil up­dated its guide­lines to rec­om­mend – among other things – that com­pa­nies work with unions and work­ers to man­age costs to save jobs.</p>
    <p>They should make use of the vari­able com­po­nents in the wage struc­ture, such as the an­nual vari­able com­po­nent and MVC, to re­duce their wage costs, and the Gov­ern­ment should re­duce busi­ness costs as well, the NWC said.</p>
