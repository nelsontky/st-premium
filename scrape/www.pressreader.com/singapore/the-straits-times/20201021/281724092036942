    <p>The up­com­ing Jurong In­no­va­tion District (JID), which has at­tracted $420 mil­lion in in­vest­ments over the past year de­spite the Covid-19 pan­demic, is “shap­ing up as the one-stop ad­vanced man­u­fac­tur­ing hub in Sin­ga­pore”, Mr Heng said, not­ing that com­pa­nies like Siemens and Hyundai will have fa­cil­i­ties in JID. “Sin­ga­pore can also be a more dig­i­tal and more re­silient ad­vanced man­u­fac­tur­ing base in</p>
    <p>Asia, for the world. I am glad many com­pa­nies con­tinue to keep faith with Sin­ga­pore dur­ing the cri­sis,” he said.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore is com­mit­ted to de­vel­op­ing and grow­ing cut­ting-edge ca­pa­bil­i­ties, such as in ro­bot­ics and 3D print­ing, to po­si­tion it­self as a more re­silient ad­vanced man­u­fac­tur­ing base in Asia, for the world.</p>
    <p>Un­der­scor­ing the coun­try’s aim to fur­ther in­dus­trial trans­for­ma­tion and growth in the re­gion, Deputy Prime Min­is­ter and Fi­nance Min­is­ter Heng Swee Keat yes­ter­day an­nounced ini­tia­tives to boost its man­u­fac­tur­ing sec­tor.</p>
    <p>Th­ese in­clude a new train­ing pro­gramme of­fice called the Ad­vanced Man­u­fac­tur­ing Train­ing Academy (Amta) that will plan ways to en­sure the man­u­fac­tur­ing work­force has emerg­ing skills and knowl­edge.</p>
    <p>Speak­ing at the open­ing cer­e­mony of the In­dus­trial Trans­for­ma­tion Asia-Pa­cific (ITAP) con­fer­ence, Mr Heng also an­nounced a part­ner­ship with the World Eco­nomic Fo­rum for a global roll-out of the Sin­ga­pore-de­vel­oped Smart In­dus­try Readi­ness In­dex (Siri).</p>
    <p>Th­ese ef­forts aim to con­tinue the up­ward mo­men­tum of the man­u­fac­tur­ing sec­tor, which grew about 3.5 per cent year on year in the first six months of this year. Man­u­fac­tur­ing con­trib­utes about 20 per cent to Sin­ga­pore’s econ­omy and em­ploys around 472,000 work­ers.</p>
    <p>The up­com­ing Jurong In­no­va­tion District (JID), which has at­tracted $420 mil­lion in in­vest­ments over the past year de­spite the Covid-19 pan­demic, is “shap­ing up as the on­estop ad­vanced man­u­fac­tur­ing hub in Sin­ga­pore”, Mr Heng said, not­ing that com­pa­nies like Siemens and Hyundai will have fa­cil­i­ties in JID.</p>
    <p>“Sin­ga­pore can also be a more dig­i­tal and more re­silient ad­vanced man­u­fac­tur­ing base in Asia, for the world. I am glad many com­pa­nies con­tinue to keep faith with Sin­ga­pore dur­ing the cri­sis,” he said.</p>
    <p>As man­u­fac­tur­ers re­think pro­duc­tion and sup­ply chains, there is a greater pre­mium on re­silience, he said, adding: “South-east Asia and Sin­ga­pore are in a good po­si­tion to be part of this re­con­fig­u­ra­tion of sup­ply chains in the com­ing years.”</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore is also strength­en­ing its dig­i­tal and mar­itime con­nec­tiv­ity, and restor­ing air con­nec­tiv­ity.</p>
    <p>Mr Heng sketched out three ways Sin­ga­pore will con­tinue ef­forts to be a “Global-Asia node” for tech­nol­ogy, in­no­va­tion and en­ter­prise.</p>
    <p>The first is in the area of set­ting stan­dards. The global ex­pan­sion of Sin­ga­pore’s Siri, which iden­ti­fies ways man­u­fac­tur­ing com­pa­nies can trans­form to meet fu­ture chal­lenges, will cre­ate op­por­tu­ni­ties for the coun­try and its in­ter­na­tional part­ners to learn from one an­other.</p>
    <p>The sec­ond is in hu­man cap­i­tal devel­op­ment. Mr Heng held up col­lab­o­ra­tions like the Global Tech­nol­ogy In­no­va­tion Vil­lage, which will be set up by the Asian Devel­op­ment Bank and Sin­ga­pore Poly­tech­nic to train re­gional gov­ern­ment and busi­ness lead­ers in emerg­ing tech ar­eas such as ar­ti­fi­cial in­tel­li­gence and 5G.</p>
    <p>Third, Sin­ga­pore has been work­ing to strengthen in­ter­na­tional busi­ness links. Mr Heng cited the Ger­many Sin­ga­pore Busi­ness Fo­rum Con­nect, which aims to en­cour­age links be­tween Sin­ga­pore firms and Ger­man com­pa­nies with a pres­ence in Asean. “By work­ing to­gether and strength­en­ing re­gional in­te­gra­tion, South-east Asia can ful­fil its po­ten­tial as a re­gional man­u­fac­tur­ing pow­er­house,” he said.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing a di­a­logue with ITAP par­tic­i­pants, Mr Heng said Sin­ga­pore has taken pains to di­ver­sify its econ­omy by in­vest­ing in var­i­ous sec­tors, so it has many en­gines of growth. “That al­lows us to be bet­ter di­ver­si­fied, to be more re­silient and also to build on the link­ages across in­dus­try,” he said, adding that ITAP was a good ex­am­ple of the man­u­fac­tur­ing and ser­vice in­dus­tries com­ing to­gether.</p>
    <p>Mr Heng added that an area Sin­ga­pore will be in­vest­ing more in is sus­tain­abil­ity, and it wel­comes ideas and part­ner­ships on this front.</p>
    <p>“We are go­ing to in­vest in sus­tain­abil­ity in our re­search and devel­op­ment work. We look for­ward to col­lab­o­rat­ing be­cause this is a global chal­lenge, and only through global col­lab­o­ra­tion can we re­solve this.”</p>
    <p>In its third edi­tion, the an­nual ITAP con­fer­ence will see world-renowned ex­perts and in­dus­try lead­ers en­gage in dis­cus­sions about the man­u­fac­tur­ing in­dus­try. Due to the pan­demic, the three-day event is be­ing held in a hy­brid man­ner, where speak­ers and guests will par­tic­i­pate in dis­cus­sions in per­son and vir­tu­ally.</p>
