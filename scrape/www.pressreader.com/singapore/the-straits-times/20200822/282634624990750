    <p>• The di­vorce pro­ceed­ings of ac­tress An­gelina Jolie and ac­tor Brad Pitt are at a dead­lock again.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to doc­u­ments ob­tained by en­ter­tain­ment mag­a­zine US Weekly, Jolie claimed judge John W. Oud­erkirk, who was hired to pre­side over the case in 2017, had “on­go­ing busi­ness and pro­fes­sional re­la­tion­ships” with Pitt.</p>
    <p>The 45-year-old Os­car-win­ning ac­tress be­lieves that Mr Oud­erkirk, who also of­fi­ci­ated at the cou­ple’s 2014 wed­ding in France, would give her ex-hus­band an ad­van­tage in the case.</p>
    <p>Her lawyer Sa­man­tha Bley DeJean told the mag­a­zine: “All my client is ask­ing for is a fair trial based on facts, with no special favours ex­tended to ei­ther side.</p>
    <p>“The only way lit­i­gants can trust the process is for ev­ery­one in­volved to en­sure that there’s trans­parency and im­par­tial­ity.”</p>
    <p>Jolie has filed a re­quest to re­move Mr Oud­erkirk from the pro­ceed­ings. Pitt’s le­gal team has ac­cused her of in­ten­tion­ally try­ing to de­lay the pro­ceed­ings, which are reach­ing its fourth year, and shot back at her claim.</p>
    <p>The court doc­u­ments read: “Un­for­tu­nately, the in­di­vid­u­als hurt most by Jolie’s trans­par­ently tac­ti­cal gam­bit are the par­ties’ own chil­dren, who con­tinue to be de­prived of a fi­nal res­o­lu­tion.”</p>
    <p>Pitt, 56, and Jolie met on the set of the ac­tion-com­edy film Mr. & Mrs. Smith in 2004, and mar­ried in 2014. She filed for di­vorce two years later, cit­ing “ir­rec­on­cil­able dif­fer­ences” and end­ing their 12-year re­la­tion­ship.</p>
    <p>They co-par­ent six chil­dren aged 12 to 19, who have been liv­ing with Jolie since the cou­ple split. Pitt has visi­ta­tion rights.</p>
