    <p>• Manch­ester City man­ager Pep Guardi­ola has urged his play­ers to be more clin­i­cal in front of goal, as right-back Kyle Walker’s long-range strike saw off win­less Sh­effield United 1-0 at Bra­mall Lane yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The Spa­niard’s men had won just two of their open­ing five Premier League games of the sea­son and are yet to hit top gear ahead of cham­pi­ons Liver­pool’s visit to the</p>
    <p>Eti­had next week­end.</p>
    <p>Speak­ing to BT Sport, Guardi­ola said: “We played re­ally well. But we strug­gled to score goals from the chances we cre­ated.</p>
    <p>“Six­teen shots, eight on tar­get, so it’s a lot against this team. They play i ncred­i­bly well down the sides, the pa­tience they have, but they had one clear chance and no more than that.</p>
    <p>“It’s our third game in seven days, all away, it’s so de­mand­ing. Peo­ple have re­sponded well.”</p>
    <p>The vis­i­tors dom­i­nated the game, but had just Walker’s spec­u­la­tive 28th-minute shot to show for it as they still lacked a ruth­less streak with­out a nat­u­ral striker.</p>
    <p>Fer­ran Tor­res played as the cen­tre-for­ward in the ab­sence of the in­jured Ser­gio Aguero and Gabriel Je­sus and the Span­ish winger had an abun­dance of chances to net his first Premier League goal.</p>
    <p>Goal­keeper Aaron Rams­dale was busy in the Blades’ goal as he twice de­nied Tor­res from close range be­fore he un­con­vinc­ingly par­ried Ro­drigo’s long-range ef­fort be­hind.</p>
    <p>Walker fi­nally broke the dead­lock from sim­i­lar range as his shot ar­rowed low past Rams­dale, but there was a muted cel­e­bra­tion from the Eng­land in­ter­na­tional against his boy­hood club.</p>
    <p>“My mum and dad live here, so if I’d cel­e­brated I’d have got a lot of stick. I’m a Sh­effield United fan, so</p>
    <p>I couldn’t cel­e­brate,” he said.</p>
    <p>The one-way traf­fic con­tin­ued early in the sec­ond half but City’s fail­ure to kill off the game gave Chris Wilder’s men chances to snatch an un­likely point.</p>
    <p>John Lund­stram had the best chance when he side-footed San­der Berge’s low cross over.</p>
    <p>Sh­effield have scored just three goals in seven games to start the sea­son and re­main sec­ond from the bot­tom with just one point.</p>
    <p>City, by con­trast, have won four of their last five in all com­pe­ti­tions as they slowly click into gear af­ter a dis­rupted start to the sea­son due to in­juries, coro­n­avirus cases and just a two-week long pre-sea­son.</p>
    <p>In the sec­ond game, winger Hakim Ziyech got his first Premier League goal for Chelsea as they beat Burn­ley 3-0 at Turf Moor. De­fender Kurt Zouma added one in the sec­ond half with a pow­er­ful header from a Ma­son Mount cor­ner, be­fore Timo Werner sealed the win.</p>
