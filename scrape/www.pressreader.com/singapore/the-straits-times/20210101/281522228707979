    <p>Sin­ga­pore will un­veil its Bud­get 2021 in Par­lia­ment on Feb 16, a Tues­day, amid an eco­nomic out­look that will re­main “highly un­cer­tain” for some time to come, said Deputy Prime Min­is­ter Heng Swee Keat yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>But he as­sured Sin­ga­pore­ans the Gov­ern­ment is pre­pared should the sit­u­a­tion go down­hill.</p>
    <p>“If the tra­jec­tory of eco­nomic re­cov­ery is on track, then we will have a more ‘tra­di­tional’ Bud­get year. But if the sit­u­a­tion takes a turn for the worse, we are ready to re­spond and adapt,” said Mr Heng, who is also the Fi­nance Min­is­ter.</p>
    <p>He gave the as­sur­ance in a Facebook post af­ter the Fi­nance Min­istry an­nounced the 2021 Bud­get Day in a state­ment.</p>
    <p>There will be live tele­vi­sion and ra­dio cov­er­age of the Bud­get, and a live we­b­cast will also be avail­able on the Sin­ga­pore Bud­get web­site.</p>
    <p>It has be­come al­most a tradition to an­nounce the date of the an­nual Bud­get around the turn of the year, Mr Heng said in his post, and “this year is no different”.</p>
    <p>But the past year has been far from tra­di­tional, he noted, as the pan­demic brought eco­nomic tur­moil around the world, in­clud­ing Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>To sup­port work­ers, com­pa­nies and house­holds through Covid-19, the Gov­ern­ment in­tro­duced sev­eral rounds of sup­port mea­sures, he said.</p>
    <p>Prepa­ra­tion for Bud­get 2021 is well un­der way, and the pan­demic is con­tained lo­cally, with the vac­ci­na­tion ex­er­cise on­go­ing, he noted.</p>
    <p>“But the over­all out­look re­mains highly un­cer­tain, and will be the case for some time to come.”</p>
    <p>In the lead-up to Bud­get 2021, var­i­ous chan­nels have been set up for Sin­ga­pore­ans to share their views and hopes for the upcoming Bud­get un­til Jan 8.</p>
    <p>Gov­ern­ment feed­back unit Reach has set up virtual and phys­i­cal lis­ten­ing points, or rov­ing feed­back booths, at high-traf­fic ar­eas, while the Peo­ple’s As­so­ci­a­tion and its grass­roots or­gan­i­sa­tions will reach out via virtual plat­forms.</p>
    <p>Themes and ques­tions to be cov­ered in­clude those on the econ­omy, work­force, so­ci­ety and com­mu­nity, a safe and smart na­tion, and en­vi­ron­men­tal sus­tain­abil­ity.</p>
    <p>Some of these ques­tions in­clude how Sin­ga­pore can en­cour­age and ac­cel­er­ate dig­i­tal adoption and sup­port vul­ner­a­ble groups more ef­fec­tively, as well as how busi­nesses can trans­form and thrive in a post-Covid-19 world.</p>
    <p>Close to $100 bil­lion was ded­i­cated to Covid-19 sup­port mea­sures, with up to $52 bil­lion drawn from the re­serves.</p>
    <p>Bukit Pan­jang MP Liang Eng Hwa, chair­man of the Gov­ern­ment Par­lia­men­tary Com­mit­tee for Fi­nance and Trade and In­dus­try, ex­pects new schemes and grants in Bud­get 2021 to be more tar­geted and mea­sured. “We have to ex­pect that di­rect re­lief in cash as­sis­tance will ta­per off, so new mea­sures will fa­cil­i­tate growth in other ways, like help­ing busi­nesses en­hance their ca­pa­bil­i­ties, pro­duc­tiv­ity and trans­for­ma­tion,” he said.</p>
    <p>There should also be in­cen­tives to en­able Sin­ga­pore to con­tinue to at­tract new di­rect in­vest­ments and en­cour­age in­ter­na­tional com­pa­nies to set up shop here. “This will help us to keep up growth rates,” said Mr Liang.</p>
    <p>Mr Ang Yuit, vice-pres­i­dent of the As­so­ci­a­tion of Small and Medium En­ter­prises, said some of the Covid-19 mea­sures such as En­ter­prise Sin­ga­pore’s E-Com­merce Booster Pack­age were use­ful in ac­cel­er­at­ing SMEs’ busi­ness trans­for­ma­tion last year. The pack­age cov­ers 90 per cent of costs to set up op­er­a­tions on ex­ist­ing e-com­merce plat­forms, among other things.</p>
    <p>He hopes to see sim­i­lar grants to help busi­nesses go dig­i­tal in the upcoming Bud­get.</p>
    <p>Grants to help com­pa­nies re­struc­ture and re­design job roles could also be made more ac­ces­si­ble so that more firms can eas­ily tap them, added Mr Ang.</p>
    <p>The Sin­ga­pore Busi­ness Fed­er­a­tion’s SME Com­mit­tee last Novem­ber sub­mit­ted sev­eral pro­pos­als to the Gov­ern­ment for the Bud­get.</p>
    <p>Among other things, it called on the Gov­ern­ment to ex­pand for­eign worker levy re­bates in the con­struc­tion, marine ship­yard and process sec­tors to cover in­dus­tries such as food and bev­er­age ser­vices, hos­pi­tal­ity and lo­gis­tics.</p>
    <p>The over­all out­look re­mains highly un­cer­tain, and will be the case for some time to come. If the tra­jec­tory of eco­nomic re­cov­ery is on track, then we will have a more ‘tra­di­tional’ Bud­get year. But if the sit­u­a­tion takes a turn for the worse, we are ready to re­spond and adapt.</p>
