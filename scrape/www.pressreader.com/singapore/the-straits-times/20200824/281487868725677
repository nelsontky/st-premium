    <p>A univer­sal pay­ment QR code is be­ing dis­played at a grow­ing num­ber of hawker stalls all over the is­land to let cus­tomers pay for, say, a plate of chicken rice or a soya bean drink with their smart­phones.</p>
    <p>Nearly a third of all 18,000 hawker stalls in Singapore now let cus­tomers pay from ma­jor bank­ing apps and e-wal­lets by scan­ning the QR code, backed by the Mon­e­tary Au­thor­ity of Singapore.</p>
    <p>A large num­ber of stalls – specif­i­cally, 1,900 – joined the na­tional e-pay­ment scheme dubbed Singapore Quick Re­sponse Code (SGQR) over the past two months.</p>
    <p>In­creas­ing hawker ac­cep­tance of SGQR is ac­com­pa­nied by greater con­sumer use. Some stalls now han­dle hun­dreds of cash­less trans­ac­tions monthly, with hawk­ers cit­ing cus­tomers’ fa­mil­iar­ity with QR code scan­ning.</p>
    <p>In this in­stance, users scan the SGQR with apps like OCBC Pay Any­one, DBS PayLah!, Grab­Pay and Sing­tel Dash for funds to be in­stantly de­ducted from linked bank­ing or stored-value ac­counts.</p>
    <p>Madam Hu Xiu Zhen, 50, for one, recorded more than 250 cash­less trans­ac­tions last month sell­ing eco­nomic bee hoon at her stall in Lorong 8 Toa Payoh Hawker Cen­tre.</p>
    <p>Just two years ago, hawker stalls – the last seg­ment of the re­tail scene here where cash is still king – were barely reg­is­ter­ing one cash­less trans­ac­tion a week, and many were not even dis­play­ing the pay­ment QR codes vis­i­bly or at all.</p>
    <p>What in­spired the change, and will it last?</p>
    <p>CASH IN­CEN­TIVES</p>
    <p>In­creased hawker adop­tion over the past two months is linked largely to the gen­er­ous cash in­cen­tives dished out by the Govern­ment.</p>
    <p>Un­der a new Hawk­ers Go Dig­i­tal pro­gramme launched in June, hawk­ers who sign up for SGQR get a bonus of $300 a month over five months if they have at least 20 cash­less trans­ac­tions in each of these five months. More than</p>
    <p>2,000 stall­hold­ers have re­ceived the bonus to date.</p>
    <p>The goal is to have all 18,000 stall­hold­ers at food cen­tres, cof­fee shops and in­dus­trial can­teens use SGQR by the mid­dle of next year.</p>
    <p>The ques­tion is whether hawk­ers will switch back to cash once the bonus pay­ment dries up.</p>
    <p>Ex­perts said hawk­ers would have to con­tinue to pro­vide cash al­ter­na­tives if cus­tomers con­tinue to ask for them.</p>
    <p>What bet­ter way to mo­ti­vate con­sumers than to re­ward them with cold, hard cash – dig­i­tal, nonethe­less, said mar­ket­ing ex­ec­u­tive An­gus Cheng, 40, re­count­ing his ex­pe­ri­ence as a WeChat Pay and Ali­Pay user in China. “Cash in­cen­tives are the oldest but most ef­fec­tive way to at­tract and keep a cus­tomer base,” said the Chi­nese na­tional, who moved here for work two years ago.</p>
    <p>Lessons can be gleaned from what the two ubiq­ui­tous Chi­nese dig­i­tal pay­ment providers WeChat Pay and Ali­Pay did six years ago to build their colos­sal user base, which in­cludes street hawk­ers and even beg­gars in China.</p>
    <p>Chi­nese In­ter­net firm Ten­cent, maker of WeChat Pay, and Alibaba, the tech firm be­hind Ali­Pay, had dan­gled mil­lions of dol­lars of cash re­bates for a few years from 2014.</p>
    <p>When the pay­ment war in China in­ten­si­fied in 2016, WeChat Pay ran a cam­paign that re­warded every con­sumer up to 888 yuan (S$178) daily for spend­ing at par­tic­i­pat­ing off­line stores over seven days. The cash re­bate was cred­ited to users’ WeChat Pay wal­let.</p>
    <p>That year, Alibaba also of­fered dis­counts of up to 999 yuan to cus­tomers who used Ali­Pay to make pay­ments at par­tic­i­pat­ing off­line stores.</p>
    <p>DIG­I­TAL GROUND­WORK</p>
    <p>Singapore may still be lag­ging be­hind China as more than two-thirds of the 18,000 hawker stalls here still of­fer cash-only trans­ac­tions.</p>
    <p>But the Covid-19 pan­demic has given the na­tion a con­sid­er­able push to build the ground­work for what would be a more per­ma­nent dig­i­tal trans­for­ma­tion.</p>
    <p>For one thing, the en­tire pop­u­la­tion was given the op­por­tu­nity to learn how to scan a QR code through the manda­tory use of con­tact trac­ing sys­tem SafeEn­try, no less.</p>
    <p>Ini­tially, users were seen strug­gling to turn on the cam­era on their smart­phone to scan a SafeEn­try QR code to en­ter more than 200,000 lo­ca­tions, in­clud­ing malls and work­places. Such sight­ings are now rare.</p>
    <p>The other foun­da­tion is dig­i­tal bank­ing en­rol­ment, which spiked dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker from April 7 to June 1.</p>
    <p>Move­ment re­stric­tions and busi­ness shut­downs dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker to stem Covid-19 in­fec­tion dis­rupted vis­its to banks and work­places. In­di­vid­u­als and or­gan­i­sa­tions turned to dig­i­tal bank­ing to con­tinue to re­ceive salaries and other pay­ments, such as govern­ment funds, to tide them­selves over fi­nan­cial hard­ships caused by the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing those months, the num­ber of users of PayNow – an in­stant fund trans­fer ser­vice that maps mo­bile phone or NRIC num­bers to bank ac­counts – grew from 3.3 mil­lion to four mil­lion.</p>
    <p>Sim­i­larly, 86,000 more or­gan­i­sa­tions signed up for PayNow Cor­po­rate – which links bank ac­count num­bers to UEN num­bers – to bring the to­tal tally to 220,000 or­gan­i­sa­tions. This ac­counts for nearly three-quar­ters of all or­gan­i­sa­tions here.</p>
    <p>Hav­ing a PayNow ac­count is the first step for the unini­ti­ated to get started on dig­i­tal bank­ing and e-pay­ments.</p>
    <p>PayNow is also one of nearly 40 pay­ment schemes ac­cepted at hawker stalls un­der SGQR.</p>
    <p>Sim­i­larly, hav­ing a PayNow Cor­po­rate ac­count means sup­pli­ers can re­ceive dig­i­tal pay­ments from hawk­ers – in­stead of re­ly­ing on cash and cheques which are more costly to print and process.</p>
    <p>ROAD­BLOCKS</p>
    <p>These glow­ing num­bers will not have a last­ing im­pact on the hawker scene here if two road­blocks are al­lowed to re­main.</p>
    <p>First, e-pay­ment in Singapore has long been crit­i­cised for be­ing con­fus­ing, with mer­chants ac­cept­ing one pay­ment op­tion and not an­other. This con­tin­ues to be the case at hawker stalls.</p>
    <p>For in­stance, an ear­lier batch of some 500 stalls in­clud­ing those at Ang Mo Kio Av­enue 4 can process SGQR, as well as Visa and Mastercard credit and debit card pay­ments, via uni­fied pay­ment ter­mi­nals that can read chip-based and con­tact­less cards.</p>
    <p>But the lat­est batch of 1,900 stall­hold­ers can process only SGQR pay­ments as they were not is­sued with uni­fied pay­ment ter­mi­nals.</p>
    <p>This means con­sumers will still run into a sit­u­a­tion where some hawker stalls ac­cept cer­tain pay­ment modes and not oth­ers – a bug­bear for decades.</p>
    <p>Also, some early adopters of e-pay­ment have not switched out of old QR codes to the lat­est SGQR code. A roti prata stall at a cof­fee shop in Changi Road, for in­stance, still dis­plays sep­a­rate PayNow and Grab­Pay QR codes.</p>
    <p>Such in­con­sis­ten­cies only con­fuse din­ers.</p>
    <p>The next road­block is tax­a­tion, which still wor­ries hawk­ers, said sources close to the project.</p>
    <p>“Will the data trail in­crim­i­nate hawk­ers es­pe­cially if they had un­der-de­clared their earn­ings in the past? Will hawk­ers be fleeced by land­lords?” asked one source, not­ing that land­lords peg monthly rents to ten­ants’ tak­ings.</p>
    <p>Hawk­ers are a seg­ment that can­not be ig­nored; a whop­ping 40 per cent of din­ing oc­ca­sions in Singapore take place at cof­fee shops, hawker cen­tres and can­teens. But trans­ac­tions in these places are mostly done in cash, whereas most trans­ac­tions at malls and restau­rants are cash­less.</p>
    <p>For e-pay­ment to be as univer­sal as cash, more needs to be done to make the user ex­pe­ri­ence con­sis­tent and seam­less – from stall to stall, and from stall to malls.</p>
    <p>These glow­ing num­bers will not have a last­ing im­pact on the hawker scene here if two road­blocks are al­lowed to re­main. First, e-pay­ment in Singapore has long been crit­i­cised for be­ing con­fus­ing, with mer­chants ac­cept­ing one pay­ment op­tion and not an­other. This con­tin­ues to be the case at hawker stalls. The next road­block is tax­a­tion, which still wor­ries hawk­ers.</p>
