    <p>• Frank Lam­pard has called for the Pre­mier League’s Satur­day early kick-offs to be scrapped as Chelsea’s tired play­ers pre­pare to face New­cas­tle in that slot today af­ter the in­ter­na­tional break.</p>
    <p>He be­lieves it is mad­ness for the league and tele­vi­sion broad­cast­ers to in­sist on the lunchtime sched­ule as it places un­due stress on over­worked play­ers.</p>
    <p>The is­sue is es­pe­cially per­ti­nent for the Chelsea boss when sev­eral of his stars were only just ar­riv­ing back in Eng­land on Thurs­day af­ter jet­ting around the world to play for their coun­tries.</p>
    <p>They will have barely any time to rest or train be­fore the trip to St James’ Park.</p>
    <p>“The ma­jor­ity of our squad have been trav­el­ling, they are just get­ting back now. They will fly up to New­cas­tle, fly back, fly to Rennes on Tues­day and then back,” said Lam­pard, whose team are in fifth place on 15 points, three be­hind lead­ers Le­ices­ter.</p>
    <p>“When you look at the sched­ul­ing, the broad­cast­ers have never had as many slots. How much does that 12.30(pm) slot need to be there? It is ab­so­lutely not the op­ti­mum way to have play­ers pre­par­ing for games. Player in­juries are go­ing up across the league.</p>
    <p>“Zero pre-sea­son, the sched­ule is tighter and if we want to han­dle them as best we can and look af­ter the play­ers, change the 12.30 time.”</p>
    <p>His com­plaint about the schedul</p>
    <p>ing comes as many of his fel­low “Big Six” man­agers step up their calls for a re­turn to the five-sub­sti­tu­tion rule that was in­tro­duced af­ter the coro­n­avirus lock­down last sea­son.</p>
    <p>He is con­vinced that de­ci­sion to keep to three in the Pre­mier League – which was voted on by top-flight teams – should be looked at again.</p>
    <p>“I think it is some­thing we have to ad­dress again with the clubs,” he said on Thurs­day. “My main con­cern is player wel­fare, they are un­der in­cred­i­ble stress, es­pe­cially those play­ing in Europe. Ev­ery­where else (in Europe) has five subs so we have to re­visit this, in my opin­ion.”</p>
    <p>Chelsea winger Chris­tian Pulisic is side­lined by a ham­string in­jury and Lam­pard is also wait­ing on the re­sults of a num­ber of Covid-19 tests, although Kai Havertz is back in train­ing af­ter a pe­riod of self-iso­la­tion.</p>
