    <p>Few in their right mind would con­sider kayak­ing down a Bangkok canal for fun, but that is ex­actly what some peo­ple have been do­ing lately.</p>
    <p>Ong Ang canal, near the Chao Phraya river, has been trans­formed from a fetid chan­nel cov­ered by a toy and elec­tron­ics mar­ket to a jade-coloured wa­ter­way lined with wide pave­ments and street art. From Fri­days to Sun­days, Ong Ang’s banks host an evening flea mar­ket with buskers ser­e­nad­ing the crowd.</p>
    <p>The kayaks are free for any­one to use, said Mr Pongsakorn Kwanmuang, spokesman for the Bangkok Metropoli­tan Ad­min­is­tra­tion.</p>
    <p>“Peo­ple in Bangkok think canal wa­ter is dirty, and they can­not touch it,” he told The Straits Times.</p>
    <p>“But we have tested the wa­ter here and it’s very clean.”</p>
    <p>It is all part of a wider evo­lu­tion that has seen the city of more than 10 mil­lion res­i­dents grad­u­ally be­come cleaner, greener and more walk­a­ble, partly be­cause mass tran­sit op­tions have im­proved.</p>
    <p>Bangkok’s steadily grow­ing sky­train and sub­way net­work can now de­posit vis­i­tors right in the heart of</p>
    <p>Yaowarat – its Chinatown – or as far away as the Erawan Mu­seum in Sa­mut Prakan prov­ince.</p>
    <p>The city has an av­er­age of 7 sq m of green space per per­son, and wants to raise it to 8 sq m, said Mr Pongsakorn.</p>
    <p>“When you go to London, you think of Hyde Park. When you go to New York, you think of Cen­tral Park. When you go to Sin­ga­pore, you think of Gar­dens by the Bay,” he noted. “We want to cre­ate a tourist at­trac­tion like that.”</p>
    <p>Mr Stu­art McDon­ald, co-founder of Trav­elfish, a South-east Asia travel plan­ning web­site, still re­calls his first ex­pe­ri­ence of the city.</p>
    <p>“I first ar­rived in Bangkok in 1993, fly­ing in from Kath­mandu, Nepal. I walked out of Don Mueang (air­port), into air as thick as but­ter and ev­ery sin­gle per­son had a mo­tor­bike. That evening, around Phra Athit, near Khao San Road, I ate de­li­cious food off the street.</p>
    <p>“The vibe was amaz­ing – it was love at first sight and bite,” he told ST. “The city was grub­bier then, but it felt more real and lived in.”</p>
    <p>That grub­bi­ness is fast dis­ap­pear­ing. Fresh flower ven­dors in the fa­mous Pak Kh­long mar­ket, who used to spill onto the side­walks with their scented wares, have since been moved in­doors.</p>
    <p>Khao San Road, the back­packer hub, now sports smooth new foot­paths level with the street and shiny bol­lards that can be re­moved when­ever the area is turned into a pedes­trian mall.</p>
    <p>It is hard to tell how pop­u­lar the changes are since most tourists are still shut out by Thai­land’s en­try ban to curb the Covid-19 pan</p>
    <p>OA­SIS IN THE CITY</p>
    <p>It used to be re­ally messy and crowded. Now it’s beau­ti­ful and re­lax­ing. I think I’ll come again.</p>

    <p>demic. But Mr McDon­ald thinks some of the re­vamps like the one in Pak Kh­long are ill-con­sid­ered.</p>
    <p>“There is clean and there is ster­ile. Their char­ac­ter, peo­ple, life and en­ergy are be­ing sucked out. For what? To cre­ate a con­trived and tacky In­sta­gram back­ground,” he said.</p>
    <p>Lo­cal res­i­dent Sumrit Paitayatat is not com­plain­ing. On a cool Fri­day evening, he was strolling along Ong Ang canal with his wife and two-year-old son.</p>
    <p>“It used to be re­ally messy and crowded. Now it’s beau­ti­ful and re­lax­ing,” said the 49-year-old en­gi­neer.</p>
    <p>“I think I’ll come again.”</p>

Hence, it is not known for now if the city&#x2019;s trans&#xAD;for&#xAD;ma&#xAD;tion is a big hit with most peo&#xAD;ple.</p>
