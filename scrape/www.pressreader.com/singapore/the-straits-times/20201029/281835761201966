    <p>YAN­GON • Once cel­e­brated as democ­racy cham­pi­ons, a tight elite of el­derly for­mer po­lit­i­cal pris­on­ers at the helm of Myan­mar’s rul­ing party now stand ac­cused of op­pres­sion, dis­crim­i­na­tion and cen­sor­ship.</p>
    <p>The Na­tional League for Democ­racy (NLD) is widely ex­pected to win next week’s elec­tion – five years af­ter it swept to power in a land­slide vic­tory.</p>
    <p>Throngs of young peo­ple signed up to the party when it emerged from mil­i­tary rule, ea­ger to play their role in ce­ment­ing democ­racy. But crit­ics now say the top ech­e­lons of the NLD re­main closed to any­one who did not serve time be­hind bars in the fight against the for­mer junta – ef­fec­tively sidelin­ing the youth.</p>
    <p>“We thought, proudly, we’d be fu­ture po­lit­i­cal lead­ers,” cur­rent NLD MP and for­mer youth leader Aung Hlaing Win, 37, said. “But, un­for­tu­nately, it went the wrong way.”</p>
    <p>The av­er­age age for the 12 mem­bers of the NLD’s top de­ci­sion-mak­ing body, in­clud­ing party boss and civil­ian leader Aung San Suu Kyi, is more than 70. All of them were jailed or placed un­der house ar­rest for op­pos­ing the mil­i­tary regime.</p>
    <p>Younger mem­bers of the party were largely re­duced to sup­port­ing acts, re­quired to ask per­mis­sion to speak to any­one out­side the party and sub­mit speeches for “cen­sor­ship”, said Mr Aung Hlaing Win.</p>
    <p>“It turned out to be an op­pres­sive sys­tem – no dif­fer­ent from the sys­tem of mil­i­tary rule,” he said. “Just be­cause they’d been po­lit­i­cal pris­on­ers didn’t mean they knew how to run a coun­try.”</p>
    <p>The hopes for change were dashed for many young democ­racy ac­tivists. Po­lit­i­cal par­ties still ask new mem­bers about the role they played in the 1988 protests, com­plained ac­tivist Thin­zar Shun­lei Li, 28, even though many of them were born in or af­ter the 1980s.</p>
    <p>“This is not the right way to judge a per­son,” she said. “Our is­sues, con­cerns and strug­gles are dif­fer­ent.”</p>
    <p>The NLD emerged from Myan­mar’s 1988 pro-democ­racy move­ment as it fought against the junta.</p>
    <p>This was when Ms Suu Kyi – now 75 – be­came a na­tional hero, serv­ing 15 years un­der house ar­rest, one of about 10,000 peo­ple im­pris­oned for their po­lit­i­cal be­liefs.</p>
    <p>But crit­ics say in­car­cer­a­tion has be­come an un­writ­ten re­quire­ment for ris­ing up in her party.</p>
    <p>“Peo­ple who served jail time longer are more im­por­tant – that’s the phi­los­o­phy of the NLD,” said for­mer NLD MP Thet Thet Khine, 53, who was kicked out last year for not toe­ing the NLD line and now heads a ri­val party.</p>
    <p>More than 120 NLD min­is­ters or MPs have served time in pri­son – from State Coun­sel­lor Suu Kyi and the pres­i­dent down. A sim­i­lar num­ber of the party’s 2020 elec­tion can­di­dates have also been jailed be­fore.</p>
    <p>“Do­ing time is a badge of hon­our,” ex­plained Yan­gon-based an­a­lyst Richard Horsey, de­scrib­ing it as an “en­try ticket to the up­per ech­e­lons of the NLD”. It is a pol­icy the party makes no at­tempt to hide.</p>
    <p>“When we con­sider giv­ing re­spon­si­bil­i­ties to some­one, we favour our old com­rades,” NLD spokesman and for­mer ’88 Gen­er­a­tion ac­tivist Myo Nyunt said. “Older peo­ple have thicker skin, while newer mem­bers can be sus­cep­ti­ble to crit­i­cism.”</p>
    <p>Crit­ics have also pointed to the NLD’s flipped role – a party led by vic­tims of po­lit­i­cal re­pres­sion that is crack­ing down on dis­senters now that it is in power.</p>
    <p>The num­ber of ac­tivists in­car­cer­ated un­der Ms Suu Kyi’s gov­ern­ment has soared. In re­cent weeks, 15 pro­test­ers have been ar­rested and two jailed six years for con­demn­ing al­leged abuses by Myan­mar’s mil­i­tary in Rakhine state.</p>
    <p>For­tify Rights re­gional di­rec­tor Is­mail Wolff de­scribed the crack­down on free­dom of ex­pres­sion as “ex­treme and wors­en­ing”.</p>
    <p>There are 537 po­lit­i­cal pris­on­ers ei­ther al­ready sen­tenced or await­ing trial, said Mr Bo Kyi, co-founder of the As­sis­tance As­so­ci­a­tion for Po­lit­i­cal Pris­on­ers.</p>
    <p>Today’s young ac­tivists are faced with an un­sym­pa­thetic pub­lic that un­ques­tion­ingly sup­ports Ms Suu Kyi, he said.</p>
    <p>“Most peo­ple don’t want any­one to do any­thing against her.”</p>
