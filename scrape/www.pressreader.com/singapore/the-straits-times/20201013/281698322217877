    <p>Trav­ellers with re­cent travel his­tory to Sabah will be re­quired to serve a 14-day stay-home no­tice (SHN), Sin­ga­pore’s Min­istry of Health (MOH) an­nounced yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Other mea­sures af­fect­ing trav­ellers were also an­nounced as part of the multi-min­istry task force’s reg­u­lar re­view of the risk of im­por­ta­tion and on­ward lo­cal trans­mis­sion from trav­ellers.</p>
    <p>Given the re­cent in­crease in cases in the Malaysian state, all trav­ellers en­ter­ing Sin­ga­pore from 11.59pm to­mor­row with a travel his­tory in the past 14 days to Sabah will have to serve the 14-day SHN at ded­i­cated SHN fa­cil­i­ties.</p>
    <p>The mea­sure will also ap­ply to re­turn­ing Sin­ga­pore-based trav­ellers un­der the Re­cip­ro­cal Green Lane scheme as well as Malaysian cit­i­zens and per­ma­nent res­i­dents en­ter­ing Sin­ga­pore un­der the Pe­ri­odic Com­mut­ing Ar­range­ment.</p>
    <p>MOH added that it will con­tinue monitoring the sit­u­a­tion in other parts of Malaysia, in­clud­ing Kuala Lumpur, Se­lan­gor and Pu­tra­jaya.</p>
    <p>Any visi­tor with re­cent travel his­tory to In­done­sia or the Philip­pines who is not a Sin­ga­pore cit­i­zen or per­ma­nent res­i­dent will have to present a valid neg­a­tive Covid-19 test to en­ter or trans­fer through Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>This will take ef­fect from next Mon­day, 11.59pm.</p>
    <p>To re­duce the i mpor­ta­tion of cases from these coun­tries, trav­ellers have to take a Covid-19 poly­merase chain re­ac­tion test within 72 hours be­fore de­par­ture. They will still be re­quired to serve a 14-day SHN at ded­i­cated SHN fa­cil­i­ties and present a neg­a­tive Covid-19 test be­fore the end of their SHN.</p>
    <p>The multi-min­istry task force also an­nounced an eas­ing of mea­sures for some other places.</p>
    <p>As the sit­u­a­tion in Hong Kong has im­proved, it will be added to the list of low-risk coun­tries or re­gions, which in­clude China and Tai­wan.</p>
    <p>Trav­ellers from Hong Kong will be al­lowed to serve a re­duced seven-day SHN at their place of res­i­dence, in­stead of 14 days at ded­i­cated SHN fa­cil­i­ties. This takes ef­fect from to­mor­row, 11.59pm.</p>
    <p>MOH also said that the Im­mi­gra­tion and Check­points Author­ity will be lift­ing visa sus­pen­sion and re­sume the is­suance of new visas.</p>
    <p>Short-term vis­i­tors who re­quire a visa to en­ter Sin­ga­pore can ap­ply for one through a lo­cal con­tact, Sin­ga­pore over­seas mis­sion or au­tho­rised visa agent from Sun­day, 11.59pm.</p>
    <p>Vis­i­tors who have al­ready been is­sued visas which are still valid, as well as those who are el­i­gi­ble for visa-free tran­sit fa­cil­ity, do not need to reap­ply.</p>
    <p>How­ever, the pos­ses­sion of a valid visa alone will not guar­an­tee en­try into Sin­ga­pore. All short­term vis­i­tors are re­quired to seek prior ap­proval through ap­pro­pri­ate Covid-19 travel chan­nels, such as ob­tain­ing a SafeTravel Pass un­der green lane ar­range­ments, to en­ter Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>Covid-19 test­ing will also be made more ac­ces­si­ble for trav­ellers, said MOH.</p>
    <p>The min­istry plans to in­crease the num­ber of clin­ics and providers which can ad­min­is­ter the test be­yond about 150 clin­ics that pro­vide pre-de­par­ture test­ing. Lab­o­ra­to­ries, clin­ics and swab ser­vice providers can ap­ply to MOH for ap­proval.</p>
    <p>In­di­vid­u­als who have been ap­proved to take such tests via the SafeTravel web­site will be able to make an ap­point­ment with the ex­panded list of ap­proved clin­ics and providers.</p>
