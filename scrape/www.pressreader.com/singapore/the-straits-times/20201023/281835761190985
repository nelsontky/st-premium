    <p>•</p>
    <p>BAKU/YEREVAN Hopes of end­ing nearly a month of blood­shed in the moun­tain en­clave of NagornoKar­abakh were re­ced­ing yes­ter­day as Az­eri and eth­nic Ar­me­nian forces fought new bat­tles on the eve of talks in Wash­ing­ton.</p>
    <p>Plans for United States Sec­re­tary of State Mike Pompeo to meet the for­eign min­is­ters of Azer­bai­jan and Ar­me­nia today raised hopes this week that the two for­mer Soviet re­publics would agree to end their dead­li­est fight­ing since the mid-1990s.</p>
    <p>But t hose hopes have been dented by the con­tin­ued heavy fight­ing in and around NagornoKar­abakh, a break­away ter­ri­tory which is in­side Azer­bai­jan but con­trolled by eth­nic Ar­me­ni­ans, and by an­gry rhetoric from both sides.</p>
    <p>Ar­me­nia’s Prime Min­is­ter said on Wed­nes­day he could see no diplo­matic res­o­lu­tion of the long-run­ning con­flict at this stage.</p>
    <p>Azer­bai­jan’s Pres­i­dent said on Tues­day his coun­try would re­claim Nagorno-Karabakh by force.</p>
    <p>Hun­dreds of peo­ple have been killed since fight­ing flared on Sept 27, rais­ing fears of a wider war draw­ing in Turkey and Rus­sia, and in­creas­ing con­cerns about the se­cu­rity of pipe­lines in Azer­bai­jan that carry Az­eri gas and oil through the South Cau­ca­sus to world mar­kets.</p>
    <p>Rus­sia has bro­kered two cease­fires since Sept 27, but nei­ther has held.</p>
    <p>Azer­bai­jan’s De­fence Min­istry re­ported fight­ing in sev­eral ar­eas yes­ter­day, in­clud­ing ter­ri­to­ries close to the line of con­tact that di­vides the sides.</p>
    <p>It also said Ar­me­nia had fired three bal­lis­tic mis­siles at three re­gions in­side Azer­bai­jan, but Ar­me­nia said this was “com­plete non­sense and a cyn­i­cal lie”.</p>
    <p>The Ar­me­nian De­fence Min­istry re­ported fight­ing in sev­eral ar­eas, and Nagorno-Karabakh of­fi­cials said the town of Mar­tuni and nearby vil­lages in the en­clave had been shelled.</p>
    <p>Azer­bai­jan wants to re­gain con­trol of Nagorno-Karabakh be­fore it agrees to end fight­ing. Ar­me­nia says it will not al­low this and ac­cuses Azer­bai­jan of mak­ing a land grab in the re­cent fight­ing.</p>
    <p>Az­eri Pres­i­dent Il­ham Aliyev said this month he be­lieved there was a mil­i­tary so­lu­tion to the con­flict, and his aide Hik­met Ha­jiyev said on Wed­nes­day that Azer­bai­jan did not ex­pect any break­through at the talks in Wash­ing­ton.</p>
    <p>Az­eri forces, bol­stered in re­cent years by in­creased mil­i­tary spend­ing and the pur­chase of weapons</p>
    <p>from Turkey, say they have made ter­ri­to­rial gains in the lat­est fight­ing, though Nagorno-Karabakh says its forces have re­pulsed re­peated at­tacks.</p>
    <p>Ar­me­nian Prime Min­is­ter Nikol Pashinyan un­der­lined how far apart the sides are on Wed­nes­day, say­ing: “Ev­ery­thing that is diplo­mat­i­cally ac­cept­able to the Ar­me­nian side... is not ac­cept­able to Azer­bai­jan any more.”</p>
    <p>Mr Pashinyan had pre­vi­ously said that Ar­me­nia was ready for talks based on mu­tual con­ces­sions and a so­lu­tion ac­cept­able to all sides of the con­flict.</p>
    <p>Mr Pompeo said on Wed­nes­day he still hoped a diplo­matic so­lu­tion could be found and un­der­lined that the “right path for­ward is to cease the con­flict, tell them to de-es­ca­late, that ev­ery coun­try should stay out”.</p>
    <p>Turkey has said it will not hes­i­tate to send sol­diers and pro­vide mil­i­tary sup­port for Azer­bai­jan if such a re­quest is made by its close ally.</p>
    <p>Rus­sia has a de­fence pact with Ar­me­nia, but Mr Pashinyan has said he does not ad­vo­cate Rus­sian mil­i­tary in­volve­ment in the con­flict.</p>
