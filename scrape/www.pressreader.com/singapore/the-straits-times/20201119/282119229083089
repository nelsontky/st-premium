    <p>Cer­tifi­cate of en­ti­tle­ment (COE) prices ended mostly higher across the board in the lat­est ten­der yes­ter­day, after a slight dip in the last ten­der.</p>
    <p>The COE price for cars up to 1,600cc and 130bhp fin­ished at $37,690, up from $35,990 two weeks ago. The pre­mium for cars above 1,600cc or 130bhp closed at $41,101, up from $39,000.</p>
    <p>The pre­mium for the Open COE, which can be used for any ve­hi­cle type ex­cept mo­tor­cy­cles but ends up pre­dom­i­nantly used for big­ger cars, also ended higher at $41,503 from $39,500.</p>
    <p>The com­mer­cial ve­hi­cle COE price closed at $30,334, down from $31,502, while the mo­tor­cy­cle pre­mium fin­ished at $7,300, up slightly from $7,251.</p>
    <p>The Land Trans­port Author­ity an­nounced last month that the quota of COEs for cars (in­clud­ing Open COEs) will in­crease by 5.8 per cent to 4,865 a month for the No­vem­ber to Jan­uary pe­riod. In to­tal, the av­er­age monthly quota comes up to 6,649, or 7.1 per cent more than the pre­vi­ous pe­riod.</p>
    <p>Mr Neo Nam Heng, chair­man of the di­ver­si­fied Prime group, said the rise in COE prices for cars was mostly a re­ac­tion to the an­nounce­ment by the Na­tional En­vi­ron­ment Agency and the Land Trans­port Author­ity that there will be an in­creased re­bate of $5,000 for cleaner cars from next year. This ap­plies to cars that are deemed to be in the A1 and A2 bands un­der the Ve­hic­u­lar Emis­sions Scheme.</p>
    <p>Not­ing that the sales of cars linked to this round of ten­der will be reg­is­tered in Jan­uary next year, Mr Neo said: “A lot of cars im­ported by par­al­lel im­porters are in the A2 cat­e­gory, so they will have an ad­van­tage in bid­ding for COEs.</p>
    <p>“An­other rea­son is that with the year end­ing, ma­jor brands are fight­ing for sales. There are also a lot of new models com­ing in, and a lot of pro­mo­tions.</p>
    <p>“I think the de­mand for com­mer­cial ve­hi­cles has peaked, so prices are go­ing to come down slowly.”</p>
