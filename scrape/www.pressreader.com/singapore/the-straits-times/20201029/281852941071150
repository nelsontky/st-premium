    <p>LUC­KNOW (India) • The health au­thor­i­ties in one of India’s most pop­u­lous states faced a big test yes­ter­day with the coun­try’s first state assem­bly elec­tion be­ing held since the novel coro­n­avirus epi­demic be­gan, de­spite calls to post­pone it.</p>
    <p>The world’s big­gest democ­racy has one of its worst out­breaks of the coro­n­avirus, with nearly eight mil­lion in­fec­tions, and vot­ers lin­ing up on the first day of a three-phase elec­tion for a new leg­is­la­ture in Bi­har state were met with masks and tem­per­a­ture checks.</p>
    <p>“I am a lit­tle afraid be­cause the coro­n­avirus is not a small dis­ease,” said Ms Nidhi Ku­mari, a 21-year-old stu­dent queue­ing up to vote in the out­skirts of the state cap­i­tal Patna. “But there are pre­cau­tions at polling booths. They are giv­ing sani­tis­ers and gloves.”</p>
    <p>In Au­gust, the Supreme Court re­jected a bid by a Bi­har po­lit­i­cal party to post­pone the vote, rul­ing that the virus was not a valid rea­son to do so.</p>
    <p>Vot­ers fol­lowed so­cial dis­tanc­ing guide­lines as they queued out­side polling sta­tions and some cov­ered their mouths with shawls or scarves, video footage from Reuters part­ner ANI showed.</p>
    <p>Polling of­fi­cials checked vot­ers’ tem­per­a­tures.</p>
    <p>Bi­har is India’s third-most pop­u­lous state, with a pop­u­la­tion of more than 100 mil­lion peo­ple. Vot­ing takes place over three days, wind­ing up on Nov 7.</p>
    <p>The out­come is not ex­pected to have any ma­jor implicatio­ns for na­tional pol­i­tics more than a year af­ter Prime Min­is­ter Naren­dra Modi se­cured a sec­ond term with a sweep­ing gen­eral elec­tion vic­tory.</p>
    <p>Mr Modi, whose rul­ing al­liance in Bi­har is up against a united op­po­si­tion, ap­pealed to vot­ers yes­ter­day “to take all Covid pre­cau­tions while par­tic­i­pat­ing in this fes­ti­val of democ­racy”.</p>
    <p>India is set to pass the mile­stone of eight mil­lion in­fec­tions today, as 43,893 new cases were re­ported in the past 24 hours, tak­ing its to­tal to 7.99 mil­lion, Health Min­istry data showed.</p>
