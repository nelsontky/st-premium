    <p>One of the lesser-known ca­su­al­ties of Covid-19 has been a large-scale ur­ban de­vel­op­ment in Toronto, led by Google sib­ling com­pany Side­walk Labs.</p>
    <p>Sev­eral years in the mak­ing, the Google City – as it was some­times dubbed in the me­dia – ul­ti­mately came to a halt be­cause of the on­go­ing re­ces­sion, but was stymied for its en­tire life­span by its pub­lic per­cep­tion as what some ac­tivists la­belled an “800-acre sur­veil­lance state”.</p>
    <p>Side­walk Labs an­nounced in May that it would end its Wa­ter­front Toronto smart city project, cit­ing the eco­nomic pres­sures from the coro­n­avirus pan­demic.</p>
    <p>While lit­tle-talked about, the fail­ure of this project is in­deed sad news – as ur­ban ex­per­i­men­ta­tion is needed to­day more than ever.</p>
    <p>Some lessons learnt in the Cana­dian city could help en­sure that Sin­ga­pore’s Smart Na­tion project con­tin­ues to suc­ceed.</p>
    <p>The project in Toronto had an up­beat start. At its launch, chief ex­ec­u­tive Dan Doc­to­roff ex­plained that the ex­per­i­men­tal neigh­bour­hood could ad­dress “costs of liv­ing... con­ges­tion... cli­mate change”.</p>
    <p>Cana­dian Prime Min­is­ter Justin</p>
    <p>Trudeau dou­bled down by say­ing: “I have no doubt Quay­side will be­come a model for cities around the world.” The plan was to trans­form Toronto’s Quay­side wa­ter­front into an 800-acre ex­per­i­ment for high-tech, smart cities. Ro­bots would serve as taxis and trash col­lec­tors, apart­ments would be made from af­ford­able, re­new­able ma­te­ri­als, and an ar­ray of sen­sors would optimise ev­ery­thing from the tim­ing of traf­fic lights to the con­fig­u­ra­tion of pub­lic space.</p>
    <p>The sub­se­quent years were not a smooth ride. The Covid-19 re­ces­sion was the last straw for a project that had been chal­lenged ev­ery day since the first press con­fer­ence, par­tic­u­larly on is­sues of pri­vacy and data own­er­ship.</p>
    <p>I sat on the ad­vi­sory com­mit­tee for the Quay­side de­vel­op­ment and wit­nessed both its prom­ise and its un­cer­tainty. Although the pub­lic con­cerns about the project have been ab­so­lutely le­git­i­mate, I be­lieve the end of the Quay­side project is ul­ti­mately a loss not only for Side­walk Labs, but also for Toronto, and for the greater cause of ur­ban in­no­va­tion – es­pe­cially in the post-Covid-19 era.</p>
    <p>THE CITY AS SO­CIAL EX­PER­I­MENT SITE</p>
    <p>Ever since hu­mans started liv­ing to­gether in large num­bers, the city has been a crit­i­cal site for so­cial ex­per­i­men­ta­tion.</p>
    <p>Me­dieval Ital­ian city-states, such as Venice and Genoa, were crit­i­cal ex­per­i­ments in the his­tory of democ­racy, while the pha­lansteres pro­posed in 19th-cen­tury France by the philoso­pher Charles Fourier brought forward the then-rad­i­cal ideas of min­i­mum wages and women’s rights.</p>
    <p>In the 1980s, a “spe­cial eco­nomic zone” in Shen­zhen acted as a cat­a­lyst for a his­toric eco­nomic boom in the Chi­nese city. The suc­cess of Shen­zhen, where a lib­er­alised econ­omy drew for­eign in­vest­ment and spurred eco­nomic growth, helped re­form­ers jus­tify na­tion­wide changes.</p>
    <p>“Without Shen­zhen,” ac­cord­ing to US econ­o­mist Paul Romer, “reform in China might have stalled be­fore it had a chance to take hold.”</p>
    <p>Ur­ban in­no­va­tion is par­tic­u­larly nec­es­sary to­day, as the In­ter­net of Things is spear­head­ing a new wave of ex­per­i­men­ta­tion.</p>
    <p>We are en­ter­ing the era of smart cities, in which in­for­ma­tion and com­mu­ni­ca­tion tech­nolo­gies cap­ture ex­traor­di­nary amounts of data and de­ploy their find­ings, of­ten in real-time, to trans­form eco­nomic and ad­min­is­tra­tive prac­tices. An ar­ray of start-ups that blend the phys­i­cal and digital, what so­ci­ol­o­gist Richard Florida calls “ur­ban tech” com­pa­nies, are at the lead­ing edge of the smart city move­ment.</p>
    <p>Fa­cial recog­ni­tion, cell­phone track­ing and self-driv­ing cars raise tremen­dous eth­i­cal is­sues.</p>
    <p>We must then try out a va­ri­ety of dif­fer­ent ap­proaches – from the pub­lic and pri­vate sec­tors – on how to best in­cor­po­rate these tech­no­log­i­cal ad­vance­ments into our lives and test out their pros and cons. We could say that we are in a sim­i­lar con­di­tion to the one we ex­pe­ri­enced in the early 2000s, when ex­per­i­men­ta­tion with a first wave of digital in­no­va­tions led to the se­lec­tion of cham­pi­ons that have changed our lives – in­clud­ing many, like Google, which are now at­tempt­ing to tran­si­tion into ur­ban tech.</p>
    <p>THE COST OF FAIL­URE</p>
    <p>There is, how­ever, one cru­cial dif­fer­ence be­tween this mo­ment and the ear­lier phase of the digital revo­lu­tion. How do we test digital in­no­va­tion in phys­i­cal space?</p>
    <p>The fail­ure of an app is one mat­ter, but the col­lapse of an ur­ban ex­per­i­ment is a dif­fer­ent story.</p>
    <p>Even ap­par­ently in­nocu­ous tech­nolo­gies can have un­ex­pected con­se­quences.</p>
    <p>Since 2017 in China and Sin­ga­pore, many start-ups (some reach­ing bil­lion-dol­lar “uni­corn” val­u­a­tions) have tried to push the vi­sion of rent­ing a dock­less bike through a mo­bile app.</p>
    <p>As their plan strug­gled to get in gear, mas­sive “bike ceme­ter­ies” piled up in va­cant lots across the world in the cities they op­er­ated in.</p>
    <p>Such fail­ures are all but in­evitable.</p>
    <p>As in an evo­lu­tion­ary sys­tem, a mul­ti­plic­ity of in­no­va­tions and mu­ta­tions in ur­ban tech­nolo­gies helps to se­lect the win­ners of to­mor­row and coun­ter­act the risk that any one idea might fail.</p>
    <p>In­ter­est­ingly, in the case of Toronto, ac­tivists were less con­cerned about the risks of fail­ure than the risks of suc­cess; they feared that Side­walk could ex­ploit their land, their econ­omy and their pri­vacy. Au­thor and #Block­Side­walk ac­tivist Cory Doc­torow wrote that “as a dystopian science fic­tion writer... it is ob­vi­ously a ter­ri­ble idea to let vast, opaque multi­na­tional cor­po­ra­tions pri­va­tise huge swathes of our city”.</p>
    <p>As Side­walk strug­gled to main­tain trans­parency and trust, the com­mu­nity’s con­cerns com­pounded.</p>
    <p>How­ever, the end of the Toronto project should not be blamed on ei­ther the risks or the critics of Side­walk’s plans. Both risks and critics are in­vari­able, nec­es­sary parts of ex­per­i­men­ta­tion.</p>
    <p>What Side­walk lacked was a ro­bust plat­form for civic dis­cus­sion, one that would have al­lowed the city to man­age its risks and build trust with its ci­ti­zens.</p>
    <p>The back-and-forth be­tween the ac­tivists and the com­pany was a con­fronta­tion, not a di­a­logue, and this pos­tur­ing dec­i­mated po­lit­i­cal con­sen­sus by de­fault. True city-mak­ing is the art of bring­ing dif­fer­ent voices to­gether.</p>
    <p>The phys­i­cal space, what the an­cient Ro­mans called the urbs, only re­sults from the co­op­er­a­tion of its peo­ple, or civ­i­tas.</p>
    <p>In an open fo­rum, par­tic­i­pants can cor­rect prob­lems as they oc­cur.</p>
    <p>SIN­GA­PORE’S EF­FORTS</p>
    <p>As Sin­ga­pore’s Smart Na­tion ini­tia­tive is as­sum­ing even more im­por­tance fol­low­ing Covid-19 – de­vel­op­ing in­fra­struc­ture for re­mote work, ac­cel­er­at­ing the econ­omy with cash­less trans­ac­tions and rein­vent­ing mass tran­sit with rob­o­taxis – all in­volved par­ties should learn from Toronto’s lessons. Im­prov­ing plat­forms for com­mu­nity involvemen­t will not be solved all at once – yet an­other ex­am­ple of why we need to con­tinue cre­at­ing new ex­per­i­ments for ur­ban in­no­va­tion.</p>
    <p>The more at­tempts we make, the more likely it will be that we can strike a healthy bal­ance in ur­ban life. It is doubt­less that some ef­forts will do bet­ter than oth­ers, which is why it is so im­por­tant to com­mit to a broad range of projects.</p>
    <p>Com­pa­nies, gov­ern­ments and com­mu­ni­ties the world over should fol­low this ex­am­ple, leav­ing no stone un­turned.</p>
    <p>We need more Google cities, more smart na­tions, more Linux neigh­bour­hoods and, cru­cially, more com­mu­ni­ties of ci­ti­zens ready to work along­side them.</p>
    <p>Some tri­als will and should fail, and that is why we need as many ideas as we can imag­ine for our com­mon ur­ban fu­ture.</p>
