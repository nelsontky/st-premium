    <p>•</p>
    <p>WASHINGTON Af­ter an elec­tion that failed to de­liver the pow­er­ful gains that Democrats had hoped for, re­sults from state­houses painted a sim­i­lar pic­ture, with the low­est num­ber of cham­bers chang­ing hands in more than half a cen­tury.</p>
    <p>Democrats had hoped for a “blue wave” to sweep state­houses that Repub­li­cans had con­trolled for years, run­ning ex­pen­sive ad cam­paigns and ex­ten­sive get-out-thevote ef­forts. But as the re­sults came in, it be­came in­creas­ingly clear that they had failed on mul­ti­ple fronts.</p>
    <p>On Wed­nes­day, the re­sults were not yet fi­nal, but the Na­tional Con­fer­ence of State Leg­is­la­tures (NCSL), which tracks state-level races, said there were changes or po­ten­tial shifts of con­trol in just four cham­bers: the New Hamp­shire House and Se­nate, which Repub­li­cans took back from Democrats, and pos­si­bly the House and Se­nate in Ari­zona, though the con­tests for those cham­bers were still too close to call.</p>
    <p>“This is crazy in that al­most noth­ing has changed,” said Mr Tim Storey, an ex­pert with the NCSL “It re­ally jumps off the page.”</p>
    <p>He said it was the first time since 1946 that so few cham­bers were chang­ing hands.</p>
    <p>Democrats failed to take con­trol of the Texas House from Repub­li­cans, a prize that had seemed within reach. They also lost the bat­tle for North Carolina’s House and Se­nate, cham­bers they had set their sights on af­ter years of Repub­li­can con­trol.</p>
    <p>And they failed to flip the Iowa House, ac­cord­ing to the NCSL. Democrats also failed to flip the Houses in Penn­syl­va­nia and Michi­gan, said Mr Storey.</p>
    <p>“Our elec­toral tar­gets in this elec­tion were in dif­fi­cult states that re­main ger­ry­man­dered from a decade ago,” said Mr Pa­trick Ro­den­bush, com­mu­ni­ca­tions di­rec­tor for the Na­tional Demo­cratic Re­dis­trict­ing Com­mit­tee.</p>
    <p>“It was al­ways go­ing to take a ‘blue wave’ for us to get deeper into the map in states like Texas and North Carolina, and that didn’t hap­pen for Democrats.”</p>
    <p>He said Democrats had achieved some vic­to­ries, like pre­vent­ing Repub­li­cans from gain­ing a su­per-ma­jor­ity in the Wis­con­sin assem­bly, which will stop the leg­is­la­ture from over­rid­ing any veto of elec­toral maps by the Demo­cratic gov­er­nor.</p>
    <p>And the elec­tion of Judge Jen­nifer Brun­ner to the Ohio Supreme Court re­duces the court’s con­ser­va­tive ma­jor­ity from four to three, he said.</p>
    <p>State­houses are im­por­tant be­cause they are the places where is­sues like abor­tion, guns and po­lice re­form get de­cided.</p>
    <p>Be­fore Tues­day’s elec­tion, Repub­li­cans con­trolled about three-fifths of all 98 par­ti­san leg­isla­tive cham­bers. If no other cham­bers flip as new re­sults come in, that Repub­li­can dom­i­nance will not change.</p>
    <p>In all, about 80 per cent of the na­tion’s 7,383 state leg­isla­tive seats were up for grabs.</p>
    <p>“It was a huge night for state Repub­li­cans,” said Mr David Abrams, deputy ex­ec­u­tive di­rec­tor of the Repub­li­can State Lead­er­ship Com­mit­tee, which fo­cuses on elect­ing Repub­li­cans to state of­fices.</p>
    <p>“Democrats spent hun­dreds of mil­lions of dol­lars to flip state cham­bers. So far, they don’t have a thing to show for it.”</p>
