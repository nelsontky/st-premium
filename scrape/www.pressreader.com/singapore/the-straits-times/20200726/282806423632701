    <p>For months, for­eign worker dor­mi­to­ries have been Sin­ga­pore’s big­gest Covid-19 chal­lenge. At one point, new cases in dorms were hov­er­ing at close to 1,000 a day, and vir­tu­ally all dor­mi­to­ries were put un­der ef­fec­tive lock­down.</p>
    <p>A mas­sive, multi-min­istry ef­fort kicked off in April to con­tain the spread in dorms, with a de­tailed sys­tem to test, iso­late and hos­pi­talise work­ers, and pro­tect those who have re­cov­ered.</p>
    <p>The work has paid off: On Fri­day, Min­is­ter for Na­tional De­vel­op­ment Lawrence Wong said Sin­ga­pore is about two weeks away from clear­ing all dor­mi­to­ries of cases.</p>
    <p>Last week, the Min­istry of Man­power said about 247,000 of the 323,000 work­ers stay­ing in dorms have ei­ther re­cov­ered or been tested to be free of the virus.</p>
    <p>There are 43 pur­pose-built dorms and 1,200 fac­tory-con­verted dorms here. Roughly 94 per cent of Sin­ga­pore’s 49,098 con­firmed coro­n­avirus cases are dorm res­i­dents.</p>
    <p>“Es­sen­tially, by Aug 7, we ex­pect to clear all dor­mi­to­ries and the vast ma­jor­ity of mi­grant work­ers,” said Mr Wong, co-chair of the multi-min­istry task force tack­ling Covid-19.</p>
    <p>“And there­after, we will be work­ing very closely with all the com­pa­nies who are en­gag­ing these work­ers to al­low them to... re­sume work as soon as pos­si­ble.”</p>
    <p>As im­por­tant as clear­ing the dorms of virus cases are the lessons learnt in pre­vent­ing new waves of in­fec­tion that are re­shap­ing the land­scape of for­eign worker ac­com­mo­da­tion here.</p>
    <p>Chief is the need to en­sure strict safe dis­tanc­ing – es­pe­cially in high­den­sity en­vi­ron­ments like dor­mi­to­ries – to slow the spread of the virus within com­mu­nal set­tings.</p>
    <p>This en­tails safety mea­sures that start at the dorms, but en­com­pass a worker’s full work­day, in­clud­ing ded­i­cated work­site trans­port and min­imis­ing work­place so­cial­is­ing.</p>
    <p>Dor­mi­tory As­so­ci­a­tion of Sin­ga­pore pres­i­dent Johnathan Cheah noted that bar­ri­ers and ded­i­cated paths to com­mon ar­eas and ex­its are now the norm to limit the mix­ing of res­i­dents at dorms.</p>
    <p>Shared fa­cil­i­ties such as stoves in com­mu­nal kitchens are now as­signed for use by work­ers from the same room.</p>
    <p>At min­i­marts and can­teens, the new de­fault is con­tact­less pickup, with work­ers or­der­ing on­line or over text mes­sages to limit min­gling.</p>
    <p>Pickup and drop-off times for those head­ing to work­sites have also been stag­gered, with ad­di­tional ar­eas des­ig­nated, to pre­vent crowd­ing.</p>
    <p>Another key les­son has been the need to spread work­ers out, so that safe dis­tanc­ing can be prop­erly prac­tised, say ob­servers.</p>
    <p>This be­gan with healthy work­ers, par­tic­u­larly those in es­sen­tial ser­vices, be­ing moved in April to army camps, float­ing fa­cil­i­ties and un­used multi-storey carparks to cut the trans­mis­sion chain.</p>
    <p>Last month, the in­ter-agency task force an­nounced plans to cre­ate ad­di­tional space as in­terim hous­ing for 60,000 work­ers for the next two to three years, while per­ma­nent dorms are be­ing built, and to test im­proved liv­ing stan­dards that “take on board lessons learnt from the cur­rent Covid pan­demic”.</p>
    <p>These stan­dards in­clude 6 sq m of liv­ing space to each res­i­dent, not in­clud­ing shared fa­cil­i­ties, com­pared with the cur­rent 4.5 sq m, in­clud­ing shared fa­cil­i­ties. The new fa­cil­i­ties will also have 15 sick bay beds for ev­ery 1,000 bed spa­ces, up from one for ev­ery 1,000 bed spa­ces.</p>
    <p>An­nounc­ing these new spec­i­fi­ca­tions, Man­power Min­is­ter Josephine Teo said the aim is to strengthen the sys­tem’s re­silience against pan­demic risks, which means both re­duc­ing the risk of wide­spread trans­mis­sion and mount­ing an ef­fec­tive re­sponse when there is an out­break.</p>
    <p>Dor­mi­tory op­er­a­tors will also have to in­stil greater dis­ci­pline in terms of hy­giene, in­ter­mix­ing and en­sur­ing the tight iso­la­tion of in­fected work­ers.</p>
    <p>On Fri­day, Mr Wong said the plan is to pro­gres­sively re­con­fig­ure for­eign worker hous­ing, and to even­tu­ally house up to 100,000 work­ers at new per­ma­nent dor­mi­to­ries to be built over the next two years.</p>
    <p>The au­thor­i­ties are racing to put up the new in­terim ac­com­mo­da­tion, which will largely take two forms: tem­po­rary struc­tures called Quick Build Dorms (QBDs) built from scratch, and un­used state prop­er­ties such as for­mer schools that will be retro­fit­ted. As work be­gan in April, some of these in­terim dor­mi­to­ries will be ready within weeks.</p>
    <p>Some of the QBDs that JTC Cor­po­ra­tion is in charge of, such as the one at Kranji Way, could be com­pleted by next month. The site, con­sist­ing of pre­fab­ri­cated one-storey sheds and shared fa­cil­i­ties, will take just three to four months to com­plete.</p>
    <p>MPs have be­gun telling res­i­dents about state sites that are be­ing turned into tem­po­rary dorms.</p>
    <p>Tampines MP Baey Yam Keng told res­i­dents that the for­mer Tampines Ju­nior Col­lege site – one of 36 sites be­ing con­verted – will be­gin re­ceiv­ing for­eign work­ers from next month, and is likely to house about 500. The work­ers’ needs will be pro­vided for within the com­pound, and ded­i­cated trans­port will take them to their work­sites, he said ear­lier this month.</p>
    <p>While some ob­servers say the lessons gleaned will stand Sin­ga­pore in good stead in the fight to come, oth­ers ask if the Gov­ern­ment has drawn the right con­clu­sions.</p>
    <p>Na­tional Univer­sity Hos­pi­tal in­fec­tious dis­eases ex­pert Dale Fisher notes that Sin­ga­pore’s abil­ity to fo­cus on con­tain­ing deaths from Covid-19 while clear­ing a quar­ter mil­lion work­ers in dorms – record­ing 27 deaths de­spite hav­ing more than 48,000 cases – is “ab­so­lutely stag­ger­ing” when com­pared with the ex­pe­ri­ence of many coun­tries.</p>
    <p>This was due in part to a novel strat­egy of mak­ing safe those most sus­cep­ti­ble to suc­cumb­ing to the virus, and as­sign­ing each dor­mi­tory a med­i­cal team “ev­ery day, seven days a week”, Pro­fes­sor Fisher added.</p>
    <p>Much re­mains un­clear in the new dorm land­scape, such as how costs – sure to go up – will be shared among dif­fer­ent stake­hold­ers.</p>
    <p>Mr Cheah said the ini­tial as­sess­ment by dorm op­er­a­tors is that build­ing costs will more than dou­ble, as will op­er­at­ing costs to im­ple­ment safety mea­sures, such as more fre­quent clean­ing cy­cles.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore Man­age­ment Univer­sity law don Eu­gene Tan said Covid-19 has thrown up ques­tions about how eco­nomic growth is at­tained and shared across so­ci­ety, and laid bare the vul­ner­a­bil­i­ties of some com­mu­ni­ties in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>As­so­ciate Pro­fes­sor Wal­ter Th­e­seira from the Sin­ga­pore Univer­sity of So­cial Sci­ences said the key les­son from the out­break should be that there are sig­nif­i­cant lim­its to re­ly­ing on pri­vate, profit-mo­ti­vated en­ti­ties to be re­spon­si­ble for pub­lic health and worker wel­fare, given “fun­da­men­tal con­flicts of in­ter­est be­tween the profit mo­tive and be­ing so­cially re­spon­si­ble”.</p>
    <p>“The les­son drawn to­day is largely that the causes are in­ad­e­quate stan­dards, reg­u­la­tion, per­haps even un­safe be­hav­iours on the part of dorm res­i­dents, and there is of course some truth to that in­ter­pre­ta­tion,” said the for­mer Nom­i­nated MP.</p>
    <p>“But it over­looks the fact that the phys­i­cal de­sign of dor­mi­to­ries, the lim­ited liv­ing spa­ces avail­able, the cost pres­sures, all con­trib­ute to pat­terns of be­hav­iour that are in­her­ently un­safe, and which re­quire huge ef­forts on the part of in­di­vid­u­als to over­come.”</p>
    <p>As­so­ciate Pro­fes­sor Wal­ter Th­e­seira from the Sin­ga­pore Univer­sity of So­cial Sci­ences said the key les­son from the out­break should be that there are sig­nif­i­cant lim­its to re­ly­ing on pri­vate, profit-mo­ti­vated en­ti­ties to be re­spon­si­ble for pub­lic health and worker wel­fare, given “fun­da­men­tal con­flicts of in­ter­est be­tween the profit mo­tive and be­ing so­cially re­spon­si­ble”.</p>
