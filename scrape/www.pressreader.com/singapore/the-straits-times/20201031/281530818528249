    <p>HANOI • Res­cue teams in cen­tral Viet­nam searched for bod­ies yes­ter­day fol­low­ing a se­ries of deadly land­slides trig­gered by Typhoon Molave, as yet an­other pow­er­ful storm edged slowly to­wards a coun­try bat­tered by its most in­tense weather in years.</p>
    <p>He­li­copters, sol­diers and search dogs have been de­ployed to look for dozens of peo­ple feared dead in at least seven mud­slides in cen­tral Viet­namese provinces that have been del­uged this month by the worst spell of flood­ing in two decades.</p>
    <p>In Quang Nam prov­ince, a district called Nam Tra My was struck by three land­slides, which killed 16 and in­jured dozens.</p>
    <p>Fif­teen peo­ple were still miss­ing. “All I can do is stand here and wait,” said Mr Ho Van Tung, watch­ing with his neigh­bours in silent de­spair as res­cue work­ers clawed through the thick um­ber mud search­ing for bod­ies.</p>
    <p>“I am wait­ing to see if they find any of the bod­ies,” said Mr Tung, whose brother-in-law was still buried some­where be­low.</p>
    <p>“If they do, I will rush over there to see if it is a loved one.”</p>
    <p>Molave is among the strong­est ty­phoons that have hit Viet­nam in the past 20 years.</p>
    <p>It has killed close to 40 peo­ple since land­ing in Viet­nam two days ago, al­though many peo­ple were res­cued on Thurs­day, in­clud­ing three fish­er­men found in the sea by a cargo ves­sel and 33 peo­ple pulled from a tiny vil­lage in Nam Tra My.</p>
    <p>Cen­tral Viet­nam has had a tough year, with its tourism in­dus­try crip­pled by the coro­n­avirus pan­demic long be­fore the ar­rival of ty­phoons that have killed at least 160 peo­ple, left dozens miss­ing, wiped out crops and forced hun­dreds of thou­sands into shel­ters.</p>
    <p>Molave left at least 22 peo­ple dead in the Philip­pines, and dam­aged nearly 1.7 bil­lion pe­sos (S$48 mil­lion) in farm out­put and more than 52,000 houses, ac­cord­ing to the au­thor­i­ties.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, an­other typhoon, Goni, gath­ered strength as it moved to­wards the Philip­pines, pack­ing winds as strong as 195kmh, said the coun­try’s weather agency Pagasa.</p>
    <p>The east­ern provinces of Aurora and Que­zon may ex­pe­ri­ence “very destruc­tive” winds when Goni makes land­fall to­mor­row evening or Mon­day morn­ing, the lo­cal weather bu­reau said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The rice-pro­duc­ing cen­tral Lu­zon re­gion is along Goni’s path.</p>
    <p>An­other typhoon, At­sani, is fore­cast to en­ter Philip­pine ter­ri­tory as early as to­mor­row, but is un­likely to bring se­vere weather to the coun­try in the next three days, the lo­cal weather agency said.</p>
    <p>Typhoon Goni, which tracks a path sim­i­lar to Molave, is on course to reach cen­tral Viet­nam later next week and would be the coun­try’s 10th typhoon this year.</p>
    <p>“My house is cov­ered in deep mud and de­bris, but I have no plan to clean it up as I heard more storms are com­ing,” Ms Nguyen Thi Sinh, a res­i­dent of Viet­nam’s Quang Tri prov­ince, said by phone.</p>
    <p>“No one had fore­seen such se­vere flood­ing. Crops and live­stock are all gone with the flood wa­ter. We have to en­cour­age our­selves with the fact we are at least still alive,” she added.</p>
