    <p>Op­po­si­tion law­mak­ers and Demo­cratic Party mem­bers Ted Hui and Lam Cheuk Ting were among 16 peo­ple ar­rested in Hong Kong yes­ter­day for their sus­pected in­volve­ment in last year’s un­rest.</p>
    <p>Two op­po­si­tion law­mak­ers who are vo­cal crit­ics of Bei­jing and the Hong Kong gov­ern­ment are among 16 peo­ple ar­rested by the po­lice for sus­pected in­volve­ment in last year’s un­rest.</p>
    <p>Law­mak­ers and Demo­cratic Party mem­bers Ted Hui and Lam Cheuk Ting were picked up from their homes at around 6am yes­ter­day, the party an­nounced via so­cial me­dia ac­counts.</p>
    <p>Po­lice yes­ter­day said they ar­rested 16 peo­ple aged be­tween 26 and 48. Four of the arrests – Hui, Lam, a male chef and a fe­male so­cial worker – are linked to a protest out­side Tuen Mun po­lice sta­tion on July 6 last year, where they face charges rang­ing from con­spir­ing with oth­ers to dam­ag­ing prop­erty, join­ing an il­le­gal assem­bly and ob­struct­ing jus­tice.</p>
    <p>In a state­ment, Hui, who was a fa­mil­iar face at last year’s demon­stra­tions, said he was only me­di­at­ing at the scene in Tuen Mun.</p>
    <p>Thir­teen of the arrests, in­clud­ing that of a bank vice-pres­i­dent, a re­cep­tion­ist and a driver, are linked to the high-pro­file Yuen Long clashes on July 21 last year. Some of those de­tained have ties to tri­ads, the po­lice said.</p>
    <p>That night, a group of white-clad men armed with sticks and clubs at­tacked black-clad pas­sen­gers at Yuen Long sta­tion, re­sult­ing in sev­eral dozens in­jured, in­clud­ing Lam, who is ac­cused of ri­ot­ing that night.</p>
    <p>The men in white were re­ported to be from tri­ads and beat­ing up the group in black, be­lieved to be passers-by and pro­test­ers on their way home af­ter an anti-ex­tra­di­tion demon­stra­tion.</p>
    <p>Lam, who was at the scene, suf­fered in­juries to the mouth, hands, feet and ab­domen.</p>
    <p>He told the me­dia af­ter the in­ci­dent that he went to the sub­way sta­tion af­ter hear­ing about the at­tack.</p>
    <p>Lam said he called Yuen Long Po­lice District and asked for of­fi­cers to be sent to the scene ur­gently but there was no ac­tion from the po­lice for more than an hour af­ter he con­tacted them.</p>
    <p>The po­lice were slammed for what was seen as their de­layed re­sponse, with of­fi­cers ar­riv­ing at the scene nearly 40 min­utes af­ter the at­tack be­gan, fu­elling ru­mours of col­lu­sion with those be­hind the vi­o­lence.</p>
    <p>Yuen Long is part of the New Ter­ri­to­ries, a largely ru­ral area close to the Chi­nese bor­der where a num­ber of vil­lagers are known to have ties to tri­ads and are sup­port­ive of the pro-Bei­jing es­tab­lish­ment.</p>
    <p>Hong Kong’s then po­lice chief Stephen Lo later de­fended his of­fi­cers, say­ing there was a need to re­de­ploy man­power from other dis­tricts, as po­lice and pro­test­ers at that time had been locked in pitched street bat­tles in the She­ung Wan district some 30km away.</p>
    <p>The in­ci­dent marked a turn­ing point in the demon­stra­tions as pro­test­ers started to di­rect their anger at the po­lice, and trust in the city’s of­fi­cers, billed as among Asia’s top in the past, nose­dived.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, the po­lice said that as of Tues­day, a to­tal of 44 peo­ple aged be­tween 18 and 61 have been ar­rested over links to the July 21 in­ci­dent. As at Aug 20, seven have been charged with par­tic­i­pat­ing in riot and con­spir­acy to wound with in­tent.</p>
    <p>In a joint state­ment yes­ter­day, 20 pan-demo­cratic law­mak­ers ac­cused law en­forcers of in­sult­ing and in­tim­i­dat­ing peo­ple’s rep­re­sen­ta­tives, adding that the move in­di­cates that the gov­ern­ment has no in­ten­tion of ad­dress­ing al­le­ga­tions of po­lice bru­tal­ity dur­ing last year’s protests.</p>
    <p>But pro-Bei­jing law­maker Ju­nius Ho, who was filmed shak­ing hands with white-clad men in Yuen Long on the night of the at­tacks, ap­plauded the arrests yes­ter­day, say­ing “be­ing late is bet­ter than never”.</p>
    <p>Mr Ho, who denied in­volve­ment in the at­tacks, said the arrests will re­store or­der in Hong Kong.</p>
    <p>The un­rest last year that spanned more than half a year was sparked by Chief Ex­ec­u­tive Car­rie Lam’s push for an ex­tra­di­tion Bill that would have sus­pects sent to the main­land.</p>
    <p>The protests mor­phed into an anti-gov­ern­ment move­ment that gained mo­men­tum fol­low­ing the Yuen Long at­tacks and other in­ci­dents.</p>
