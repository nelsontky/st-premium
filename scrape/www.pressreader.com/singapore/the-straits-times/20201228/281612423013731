    <p>BANGKOK • Thai­land con­firmed 121 new in­fec­tions of the coro­n­avirus, a se­nior of­fi­cial said yes­ter­day, up from the 103 cases re­ported ear­lier in the day.</p>
    <p>Mr Taweesin Wisanuyoth­in, a spokesman for the coun­try’s Covid-19 pan­demic task force, said at a brief­ing that the new cases in­clude 94 do­mes­tic trans­mis­sions and 18 mi­grant work­ers con­nected to an out­break at a seafood mar­ket in Sa­mut Sakhon, a prov­ince south­west of Bangkok.</p>
    <p>In­fec­tions con­nected to this clus­ter have spread to 38 prov­inces.</p>
    <p>Thirty-six lo­cal in­fec­tions were in Ray­ong prov­ince, linked to a gam­bling den, the spokesman said.</p>
    <p>“The num­bers re­flect a heav­ier (out­break), but we have more knowl­edge and ca­pac­ity,” he said, adding that the au­thor­i­ties are ready to han­dle the in­creased num­bers.</p>
    <p>Eight new cases were found in state quar­an­tine fa­cil­i­ties, and one in­fec­tion was a per­son ar­riv­ing from abroad who did not en­ter quar­an­tine.</p>
    <p>Thai­land has re­ported a to­tal of 6,141 cases and 60 deaths.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, the Thai au­thor­i­ties last Fri­day or­dered a fa­mous Chi­nese Bud­dhist tem­ple lo­cated in Non­thaburi prov­ince’s Bang­buathong dis­trict to be closed tem­po­rar­ily from that day un­til Jan 8.</p>
    <p>“Of­fi­cials will use the tem­ple’s premises as a quar­an­tine lo­ca­tion for per­sons sus­pected of con­tract­ing Covid-19 but have yet to show symp­toms,” Non­thaburi pro­vin­cial of­fi­cials said on Face­book, re­fer­ring to Wat Borom­racha Kan­chanapisek Anu­sorn, also known as Wat Leng Noei Yi 2 tem­ple.</p>
    <p>Two new Covid-19 cases have been re­cently re­ported in Non­thaburi – both are fe­male Myan­mar na­tion­als who work at the tem­ple.</p>
    <p>Af­ter the cases were de­tected, 113 monks and staff of the tem­ple were quar­an­tined within the tem­ple. Health of­fi­cials are trac­ing their travel his­tory and test­ing peo­ple who might have had close con­tact with the pa­tients.</p>
    <p>Separately, the Aus­tralian au­thor­i­ties ex­tended a lock­down for Syd­ney’s North­ern Beaches un­til at least Wed­nes­day and urged the rest of the city to avoid crowds as a clus­ter of Covid-19 in­fec­tions con­tin­ues to grow. Nine new cases were recorded overnight, tak­ing the clus­ter’s to­tal to 116.</p>
    <p>Health of­fi­cials re­main con­cerned that the virus had spread across the city in the days lead­ing to Christ­mas, and have urged Syd­neysiders to limit their ac­tiv­i­ties in the com­ing days and avoid Box­ing Day shop­ping sales in the Cen­tral Busi­ness Dis­trict (CBD).</p>
    <p>“There are still con­cerns about the CBD and still con­cerns about peo­ple in the North­ern Beaches who may un­in­ten­tion­ally have spread the virus,” New South Wales state Premier Gla­dys Bere­jik­lian told re­porters last Satur­day.</p>
