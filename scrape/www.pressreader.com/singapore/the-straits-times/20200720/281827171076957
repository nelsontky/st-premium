    <p>HONG KONG • Hong Kong’s sta­tus as a bas­tion of press free­dom is in cri­sis as the au­thor­i­ties toughen their line against in­ter­na­tional me­dia, and fears grow about lo­cal self­cen­sor­ship un­der the city’s sweep­ing new se­cu­rity law.</p>
    <p>For decades, the for­mer Bri­tish colony has been a shin­ing light for jour­nal­ists in Asia, ly­ing on the fringes of an au­thor­i­tar­ian China where the rul­ing Com­mu­nist Party keeps a tight grip on pub­lic opin­ion.</p>
    <p>The civil lib­er­ties that have stew­arded the city’s suc­cess were promised to Hong Kongers for an­other 50 years un­der a deal that re­turned the trad­ing hub to Chi­nese rule in 1997.</p>
    <p>But Bei­jing’s new na­tional se­cu­rity law – im­posed in re­sponse to last year’s huge and some­times vi­o­lent pro-democ­racy protests – has sent a shiver through the fi­nan­cial hub’s me­dia land­scape.</p>
    <p>“It’s a body blow. It’s the end of press free­dom as we knew it in Hong Kong,” Ms Yuen Chan, a for­mer lo­cal re­porter now lec­tur­ing at London’s City Univer­sity, told Agence France-Presse (AFP).</p>
    <p>The New York Times, CNN, Bloomberg, The Wall Street Jour­nal, CNBC, the Fi­nan­cial Times and AFP are among nu­mer­ous in­ter­na­tional me­dia out­lets with a pres­ence in the city, many bas­ing their re­gional head­quar­ters there.</p>
    <p>Free from the ha­rass­ment, cen­sor­ship and re­stric­tions per­va­sive on the au­thor­i­tar­ian Chi­nese main­land, semi-au­tonomous Hong Kong has thrived as a safe haven for both lo­cal and for­eign re­porters.</p>
    <p>But signs of the sands shift­ing have be­gun to emerge since China in­tro­duced its dra­co­nian new law ear­lier this month.</p>
    <p>Last week, The New York Times an­nounced it would re­lo­cate a third of its staff to Seoul, say­ing it faced un­prece­dented trou­ble ob­tain­ing visas.</p>
    <p>The Hong Kong au­thor­i­ties re­cently launched a re­view of in­de­pen­dent but state-funded broad­caster RTHK, fol­low­ing ac­cu­sa­tions that it was overly sym­pa­thetic to pro-democ­racy protests.</p>
    <p>Im­me­di­ately after the se­cu­rity law was passed, two colum­nists quit the city’s ram­bunc­tious Ap­ple Daily news­pa­per, a staunch ad­vo­cate for greater democ­racy.</p>
    <p>The tabloid is owned by Mr Jimmy Lai, a ty­coon la­belled by Chi­nese state me­dia as a lead­ing “black hand” col­lud­ing with for­eign forces to de­stroy the main­land.</p>
    <p>OPEN SEA­SON</p>
    <p>Bei­jing has made lit­tle se­cret of its de­sire to rein in Hong Kong’s me­dia, both do­mes­tic and for­eign.</p>
    <p>One pro­vi­sion of the na­tional se­cu­rity law or­ders the au­thor­i­ties to “strengthen the man­age­ment” of for­eign news or­gan­i­sa­tions.</p>
    <p>“It seems like they are start­ing to at least con­sider us­ing the visa as a means to pun­ish the peo­ple they don’t like,” said Mr Keith Rich­burg, di­rec­tor of the Jour­nal­ism and Me­dia Stud­ies Cen­tre at The Univer­sity of Hong Kong and a for­mer for­eign correspond­ent for The Wash­ing­ton Post.</p>
    <p>In 2018, Fi­nan­cial Times jour­nal­ist Vic­tor Mal­let was re­fused a visa re­newal weeks after he hosted a talk at the city’s for­eign press club with an in­de­pen­dence ac­tivist.</p>
    <p>Ms Shar­ron Fast, deputy di­rec­tor of The Hong Kong Univer­sity’s jour­nal­ism pro­gramme, said the clause about for­eign me­dia in the new law “sounds omi­nously like Hong Kong will move to­wards a Chi­nastyle press cre­den­tial re­quire­ment”.</p>
    <p>The leg­is­la­tion also grants the ter­ri­tory’s po­lice and China’s in­tel­li­gence ap­pa­ra­tus sweep­ing sur­veil­lance pow­ers, some­thing Ms Fast said could make it harder for jour­nal­ists to pro­tect their sources.</p>
    <p>“It is ba­si­cally open sea­son on in­ter­cep­tion of com­mu­ni­ca­tions and on­line sur­veil­lance,” she told AFP.</p>
    <p>Much of the l aw is broadly worded and crim­i­nalises cer­tain speech, such as a ban on in­sti­gat­ing ha­tred to­wards the gov­ern­ment or ad­vo­cat­ing in­de­pen­dence.</p>
    <p>Jour­nal­ists fear they may in­ad­ver­tently cross a red line by re­port­ing what oth­ers say.</p>
    <p>SELF-CEN­SOR­SHIP</p>
    <p>Me­dia groups warn that lo­cal out­lets are par­tic­u­larly vul­ner­a­ble.</p>
    <p>Hong Kong re­porters have his­tor­i­cally been a cru­cial con­duit of in­for­ma­tion out of the main­land.</p>
    <p>And the city’s press corps rou­tinely bar­rages of­fi­cials with the kind of crit­i­cal ques­tion­ing that would be un­think­able north of the bor­der.</p>
    <p>Ear­lier this month, Hong Kong’s Chief Ex­ec­u­tive Car­rie Lam was asked if she could “100 per cent guar­an­tee” me­dia free­doms.</p>
    <p>Her re­ply was that if re­porters “guar­an­tee that they will not com­mit any of­fences un­der this piece of na­tional leg­is­la­tion”, then she could.</p>
    <p>How­ever, even be­fore the se­cu­rity law, the lo­cal me­dia was un­der pres­sure, with ad­ver­tis­ing of­ten dry­ing up for the most Bei­jing-crit­i­cal out­lets.</p>
    <p>“The prob­lem of self-cen­sor­ship, which has al­ready been a con­cern, will get worse,” said Mr Chris Ye­ung from the Hong Kong Jour­nal­ists As­so­ci­a­tion.</p>
    <p>“It is likely that the main­land­style me­dia con­trol sys­tem and mech­a­nism will be grad­u­ally in­tro­duced in Hong Kong.”</p>
    <p>But Ms Chan said the press would not be eas­ily tamed.</p>
    <p>“Jour­nal­ists in Hong Kong will do as much as they can for as long as they can,” she said.</p>
    <p>Mr Lai was asked in an on­line ques­tion and an­swer ses­sion last Fri­day about the fu­ture of his re­port­ing staff.</p>
    <p>“It’s very dif­fi­cult to pro­tect them. All I can do is tell them to do things ac­cord­ing to their con­science,” he said. “I can­not ask them to be a mar­tyr.”</p>
