    <p>For a few months now, I have been hear­ing my son gig­gling alone in his room.</p>
    <p>Whis­per-whis­per, gig­gle-gig­gle. He chats with friends on a group call, wear­ing his fa­ther’s Zoom con­fer­ence head­set. I eaves­drop out­side: What con­spir­a­cies are these 11-year-olds hatch­ing?</p>
    <p>The penny drops when I read an ar­ti­cle about Among Us, the on­line game turned global hit thanks to the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>The multi-player game re­quires “crew­mates” on a space­ship to suss out “im­pos­tors” in their midst and vote them off. Crew­mates can also win by com­plet­ing main­te­nance tasks; im­pos­tors win by killing crew­mates and sab­o­tag­ing the ship.</p>
    <p>Think pri­mary school’s ana­logue Mur­derer game (wink, you’re dead – shhhh!), with car­toon graph­ics and a rudi­men­tary chat in­ter­face.</p>
    <p>Bored teens and lonely adults have em­braced the game un­der lock­down. United States politi­cians have streamed them­selves play­ing it.</p>
    <p>My hus­band and I love play­ing games with our two sons, aged 14 and 11. Through play, the kids have picked up all kinds of skills: read­ing, math­e­mat­ics, co­op­er­a­tion, anal­y­sis and strat­egy. Now that they are old enough to se­lect their own games and op­po­nents, how­ever, it feels like one av­enue for bond­ing is grad­u­ally clos­ing.</p>
    <p>Cu­ri­ous about this new game ev­ery­one is play­ing – and want­ing in on this se­cret world my son has been im­mersed in – I sug­gest we play to­gether. We play both pub­lic games with strangers and pri­vate ones with his school­mates. What I don’t ex­pect is to dis­cover the wis­dom of chil­dren.</p>
    <p>Here’s what The Boy taught me.</p>
    <p>1</p>
    <p>TRUST IS A BEAU­TI­FUL THING:</p>
    <p>A dead body is re­ported; an emer­gency meet­ing called. What’s hap­pen­ing? Who died? Where? Who do I vote?</p>
    <p>“It’s Cyan. Vote Cyan,” The Boy help­fully tells me.</p>
    <p>“How do you know?” My adult scep­ti­cism kicks in.</p>
    <p>The Boy shows me bits in the chat where peo­ple are at­test­ing to player Cyan’s guilt (we’re all dif­fer­ent colours). I am not con­vinced by the ev­i­dence – or by herd men­tal­ity. In my panic, I ab­stain from vot­ing (known as “skip”).</p>
    <p>It turns out Cyan is the im­pos­tor. The Boy fixes me with a calm gaze. “You must learn to trust oth­ers.”</p>
    <p>I am amused. Yet, I’m also jolted by the truth of his state­ment. It’s just a game, so why not? Trust is the first step in form­ing a com­mu­nity. A para­noid per­son like me will al­ways strug­gle to find a tribe.</p>
    <p>2</p>
    <p>STAND UP FOR WHAT’S RIGHT:</p>
    <p>Half­way through a pub­lic game, White starts spout­ing racist re­marks.</p>
    <p>“I don’t like black peo­ple,” he or she de­clares, apro­pos of noth­ing, in the chat. Then: “Help. I can’t breathe.”</p>
    <p>It is an odi­ous ref­er­ence to the cruel killing of African-Amer­i­can mu­si­cian Ge­orge Floyd by Min­nesota po­lice in May this year. “Vote him out,” says Brown. “White is say­ing they can’t breathe like Ge­orge Floyd,” says Orange. “White has to go.”</p>
    <p>“Vote White,” my son in­structs me firmly. Im­me­di­ately.</p>
    <p>Racist White is ejected into space. Good rid­dance.</p>
    <p>We keep play­ing, even though the loss of a crew­mate makes it harder for us to beat the im­pos­tor.</p>
    <p>Par­ents worry about bad in­flu­ences on­line on our chil­dren. But we don’t al­ways wit­ness the flip side, where they choose to stand on the side of jus­tice. Some­times, par­ent­ing is about al­low­ing them the space to ex­er­cise their judg­ment ac­cord­ing to the ex­am­ple you’ve set. See also: “trust is a beau­ti­ful thing” above.</p>
    <p>3 THERE</p>
    <p>IS CRE­ATIV­ITY IN A COM­PUTER/MO­BILE GAME:</p>
    <p>The crew­mates are run­ning all over the place. One or an­other would an­nounce at the start of each game that he is the im­pos­tor.</p>
    <p>“It’s me!” Black types. “Run! Run!”</p>
    <p>What’s go­ing on? Wait, I just learnt the rules. What’s hap­pen­ing?</p>
    <p>“It’s hide and seek,” my son in­forms me. “Just run when you see Black, be­fore he can kill you.”</p>
    <p>“But what about my tasks?” I wail. “I want to do my tasks!”</p>
    <p>“Do them later,” says The Boy. “Just run! Follow me!”</p>
    <p>Some­where along the line, he and his com­pa­tri­ots have dis­cov­ered new ways of play­ing the game. I am re­minded of the con­cept of neu­ral plas­tic­ity – the abil­ity of the ner­vous sys­tem to change; to grow and re­or­gan­ise. Young peo­ple are not lim­ited to the rules they are given. They adapt and re­cast, so things stay fresh and fun. Who says we must al­ways do things the same way? Who says we can’t imag­ine anew?</p>
    <p>4</p>
    <p>YOUR KIDS ARE GO­ING TO BE BET­TER THAN YOU AT EV­ERY­THING:</p>
    <p>“Are you re­ally Lu­cien’s mum?” asks one of The Boy’s school­mates when I join their game.</p>
    <p>“Yes,” I say.</p>
    <p>“Wow.”</p>
    <p>They are sweet boys, not com­plain­ing about how slow I am at tasks, or how clue­less I am in dis­cus­sions. They just ac­cept me. How egal­i­tar­ian.</p>
    <p>“She doesn’t know how to sab­o­tage!” says my son, com­ing to my de­fence when some­one raises the pos­si­bil­ity of me be­ing the im­poster.</p>
    <p>I do, ac­tu­ally, and I am – but I’m touched by his be­lief in my in­no­cence. I feel a lit­tle bad about ly­ing to these boys. Even when it be­comes as clear as day that I’m the traitor, they are po­lite and don’t vote me out.</p>
    <p>“You’re quite bad at this game,” The Boy ob­serves, after I keep vot­ing gen­uine crew­mates and get­ting caught red-handed in the act of mur­der.</p>
    <p>At some point, your kids are go­ing to be bet­ter than you at ev­ery­thing. It’s al­ready hap­pen­ing – The Boy knows it. But he doesn’t kick me off the space­ship. He is kind and pa­tient enough to teach this old dog new tricks. Some­thing I should re­mem­ber, the next time I re­vise Chi­nese with him or cor­rect his gram­mar.</p>
    <p>Us par­ents grow used to the idea of kids be­long­ing to us. It’s eye-open­ing to join their posse and see them as their own peo­ple, crack­ing jokes with bud­dies. And it still comes as a sur­prise that The Boy is happy to squire me among his peers, in­stead of treat­ing me as an em­bar­rass­ing author­ity fig­ure cramp­ing his style.</p>
    <p>We are theirs, as much as they are ours.</p>
