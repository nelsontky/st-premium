    <p>In his 46 years, Mo­ham­mad Zubayar Anis had never won a prize in a lucky draw.</p>
    <p>This year, be­sides re­ceiv­ing race en­ti­tle­ments in­clud­ing a fin­isher’s medal and a New Bal­ance T-shirt after com­plet­ing 175km in The Straits Times Vir­tual Run (STVR), he also walked away with the grand lucky draw prize; a Pana­sonic 55-inch HZ1000S 4K Ul­tra HD OLED TV set worth $3,699.</p>
    <p>Zubayar said: “When I first got the call, I wasn’t re­ally sure be­cause I thought it was a prank call but after it was con­firmed, I was pleas­antly sur­prised.”</p>
    <p>Thanks to its OLED panel and smooth mo­tion per­for­mance, the HZ1000S de­liv­ers crisp images, fresh colours and deep blacks. It also boasts a new Film­maker</p>
    <p>Mode, which presents films as the di­rec­tor in­tended. This ini­tia­tive is sup­ported by ma­jor Hol­ly­wood direc­tors like Christo­pher Nolan and Martin Scors­ese.</p>
    <p>The HZ1000S also comes with sup­port for HDR10+, Dolby Vi­sion and Dolby At­mos, and with its slim and min­i­mal­ist de­sign, the tele­vi­sion will fit into any home.</p>
    <p>This was Zubayar’s third con­sec­u­tive time par­tic­i­pat­ing in the ST Run. He com­pleted 10km in 2018 and 18.75km last year and had en­joyed his ex­pe­ri­ence so much he de­cided to chal­lenge him­self in the 175km cat­e­gory this year.</p>
    <p>He com­pleted the dis­tance on Dec 12 by walk­ing 5km to 9.5km with two to three neigh­bours three to four times a week.</p>
    <p>This year’s ST Run be­came a vir­tual af­fair ow­ing to the coro­n­avirus pan­demic and saw 14,500 par­tic­i­pants run­ning in two cat­e­gories (17.5km and 175km) from Oct 9 to</p>
    <p>Dec 17. The draw for the grand prize was con­ducted on Mon­day last week and it is the eighth con­sec­u­tive year that Pana­sonic is the ST Run’s pre­sent­ing spon­sor.</p>
    <p>Lee Yulin, chair­man of the STVR or­gan­is­ing com­mit­tee, con­grat­u­lated Zubayar and all race par­tic­i­pants and added: “We are also grate­ful to our pre­sen­ter Pana­sonic for their strong sup­port of</p>
    <p>the ST Vir­tual Run this year even in such a chal­leng­ing eco­nomic cli­mate.</p>
    <p>“Our thanks also go out to our other key spon­sors – OCBC, New Bal­ance and 100Plus – for walk­ing along­side us in this vir­tual jour­ney, which is a first for the ST Run.”</p>
    <p>Joanne Ng, gen­eral man­ager for Pana­sonic Sin­ga­pore, said: “It has al­ways been our social re­spon­si­bil</p>
    <p>ity to pro­mote health­ier and better liv­ing and ST Run en­cap­su­lates this ini­tia­tive.</p>
    <p>“At Pana­sonic, we will con­tinue in our com­mit­ment to im­prove the over­all qual­ity of life for ev­ery­one through in­no­va­tion and tech­nol­ogy to bring a better life, a better world to all.”</p>
