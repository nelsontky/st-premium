    <p>Love is life in mo­tion.</p>
    <p>A happy lover in a Ben­gali song re­mem­bers how his beloved’s foot­steps stopped when she stepped on his heart ly­ing spread on the ground. In an­other song, the beloved prom­ises the lover: “When you fi­nally come to me, you will for­get your way back.”</p>
    <p>Less lucky, the beloved in yet an­other song says that she has waited so long in se­cret to see her lover that her dawn­ing be­ing has turned to dusk. Cow­dust ar­rives with an­i­mals re­turn­ing home from pas­ture, but for her, dusk comes without the one wan­derer who an­chors her rest­less eyes.</p>
    <p>In that ele­giac spirit, a Ben­gali lyric in­ter­ro­gates all lovers, born or yet to be: “How many tears have you shed, and how much have your feet bled, that you are in love?”</p>
    <p>An an­swer ar­rives in a Hindi song in which the beloved de­clares that she will not stop walk­ing to­wards destiny, not be­cause she be­lieves in it, but just in case she re­ceives news of her lover along the way.</p>
    <p>That song re­volves around shama and par­wana, two en­dur­ing mo­tifs of Per­sian-Urdu po­etry.</p>
    <p>The light of shama, the static flame, at­tracts par­wana, the way­ward moth. How­ever, shama’s light ex­udes heat as well, which kills par­wana when it draws too close to it. Shama em­bod­ies fa­tal fe­male at­trac­tion; par­wana is fated male long­ing.</p>
    <p>But what hap­pens when shama searches for par­wana in­stead of the other way around? That is the ques­tion posed by the song.</p>
    <p>The an­swer is fore­told. Shama the can­dle knows that she will die out with the melt­ing of the wax. While she burns her­self to ex­tinc­tion, she can do no more than in­vite par­wana to share her fate. He wings his way to her know­ingly, to seek the fi­nal con­sum­ma­tion of love in death.</p>
    <p>How­ever, the lover in a Tamil song de­clares that he melted as a can­dle in his beloved’s mem­ory, but she flew away beau­ti­fully, cast­ing aside his heart.</p>
    <p>The song over­turns the gen­dered ta­bles on erotic tropes that blame the fe­male flame for de­stroy­ing the male butterfly. Love is a move­ment without gen­der.</p>
    <p>Move­ment does not have to cease with death. I en­coun­tered two flut­ter­ing but­ter­flies in the Sin­ga­pore Botanic Gar­dens.</p>
    <p>“Liang Zhu,” I called out. They ig­nored me and flew on in erotic union in the tire­less beat­ing of each other’s wings.</p>
    <p>That is how the butterfly lovers, Liang Shanbo and Zhu Ying­tai, have sur­vived since the East­ern Jin dynasty. Ly­ing in Liang’s grave, which light­ning opened up to re­ceive Zhu, she be­came a part of the ele­ments like him. Their spir­its flew out as two but­ter­flies.</p>
    <p>They travel on in Sin­ga­pore even to­day, bear­ing wit­ness to the peri­patetic agency of classical Chi­nese love.</p>
    <p>Surely, they en­counter Prince Ker­ta­p­ati and Princess Raden Pus­pak­en­cana along the way. Time­less gifts of the classical Malay imag­i­na­tion, theirs is the story of a princess whom the prince meets while hunt­ing in the plea­sure gar­den of his father.</p>
    <p>Royal in­trigue kills her, and he com­mits sui­cide. How­ever, divine in­ter­ces­sion brings them back to life and re­stores to them their de­served king­dom.</p>
    <p>Hunt­ing is pro­hib­ited in the Botanic Gar­dens, but beloved and lover are free to chase each other to eter­nity there to­day.</p>
    <p>Classical In­dia lives on as well in the gar­dens. I have en­coun­tered work­ers from South Asia look­ing up to the skies ha­bit­u­ally while tend­ing to the trees.</p>
    <p>Kal­i­dasa’s Meghadu­tam (The Cloud Mes­sen­ger) in­vokes the clouds on be­half of an ex­iled na­ture spirit. The be­nign yak­sha, em­ployed to keep the gar­dens beau­ti­ful for a rich mas­ter, ne­glected his work, prob­a­bly while ro­manc­ing his wife in the fer­tile com­pany of sen­sual mon­soon rains. Ban­ished, he re­mem­bers the ten­der tan­gi­bil­ity of those mo­ments and im­plores the clouds preg­nant with rain to unite him with his wife again.</p>
    <p>I do not know what laws of work the labour­ers broke back home. In Sin­ga­pore, their thoughts can­not but be­long to Kal­i­dasa and his itin­er­ant imag­i­na­tion.</p>
    <p>While they work, flow­ers bloom be­tween stones. Beauty seems to have made a mis­take, but it has not be­cause hu­man sight, ac­cus­tomed equally to flow­ers and stones, prizes the sur­prise of their unan­nounced com­pan­ion­ship. I cher­ish the labour of the work­ers blos­som­ing in me.</p>
    <p>As for Eurasians, they are in love with the two halves of Sin­ga­pore. The Euro­pean half of their an­ces­try em­braces their Asian present. The Asian half of their an­ces­try holds on to the Euro­pean present.</p>
    <p>I took to Eurasians in­stinc­tively when I ar­rived in Sin­ga­pore. They con­tin­ued the bi­cul­tural tra­di­tion of the An­glo-In­dian teach­ers who taught me English in Kolkata, a Ben­gali city that was theirs as much as it was mine.</p>
    <p>They loved In­dia in English and taught me to love English as a fel­low In­dian. Love is not only per­sonal long­ing, but also a quest for unity with an en­tity greater than one­self. Cul­ture is to the col­lec­tiv­ity what phys­i­cal in­ti­macy is to in­di­vid­u­al­ity.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore is in­hab­ited by flut­ter­ing but­ter­flies, van­ished roy­alty, be­nign spir­its, play­ful clouds, Asia’s Europe, Europe’s Asia, stub­born stones, re­cal­ci­trant flow­ers, and me.</p>
    <p>When shama flick­ers, some­one is par­wana. When shama burns out, par­wana forms him­self into death-shaped love at her waxen feet. Shama and par­wana can ex­change gen­ders but not roles.</p>
    <p>This is a coun­try fated for love. Love ex­ists only in mo­tion. No coro­n­avirus, no pan­demic and no re­ces­sion can de­stroy the erotic legacy of last­ing cul­tures. But we must chase af­ter the love that has chased us here.</p>
