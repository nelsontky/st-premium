    <p>LON­DON • World Cup fans will be able to watch an un­prece­dented four games a day on TV, spread out over 11 hours, dur­ing the group stage of the Qatar 2022 tour­na­ment af­ter the sched­ule was con­firmed on Wed­nes­day.</p>
    <p>With the rel­a­tively short travel dis­tances for the venues in and around Doha, it could be pos­si­ble for fans who travel to the 32-team tour­na­ment to at­tend mul­ti­ple games each day.</p>
    <p>The early games will kick off at 1pm lo­cal time (6pm in Sin­ga­pore) with the fourth match start­ing at 10pm (3am in Sin­ga­pore).</p>
    <p>The open­ing game will be held on Nov 21 at the 60,000-ca­pac­ity Al Bayt Sta­dium, with its dis­tinc­tive “tent-style” cov­er­ing. The fi­nal on Dec 18 will be at the 80,000-seater Lu­sail Sta­dium, which, like Al Bayt, will also host a semi-fi­nal.</p>
    <p>“The World Cup is al­ways a fes­ti­val of foot­ball, a real cel­e­bra­tion for the fans who come on site and watch,” said Fifa chief tour­na­ments and events of­fi­cer, Colin Smith.</p>
    <p>“In Qatar, with the com­pact na­ture, this is go­ing to be am­pli­fied even more with 32 teams and 32 sets of sup­port­ers all in and around Doha.”</p>
    <p>Foot­ball’s world gov­ern­ing body Fifa will wait un­til the draw for the tour­na­ment is held in March or April 2022 be­fore as­sign­ing spe­cific games to venues and also time slots.</p>
    <p>That will en­able it to bet­ter align games with time zones for do­mes­tic TV part­ners of the com­pet­ing teams.</p>
    <p>The qua­dren­nial tour­na­ment was switched to the win­ter sea­son from its usual June-July slot due to the</p>

    <p>Nasser Al Khater, chief ex­ec­u­tive of­fi­cer of the or­gan­is­ing com­mit­tee, said that plans for the tour­na­ment were well on sched­ule, with 90 per cent of the work fin­ished on roads and in­fra­struc­ture.</p>
    <p>“When we talk about the sta­di­ums, more than 85 per cent of the work has been com­pleted and re­ally now, the last two years, we’re fo­cus­ing on our op­er­a­tion readi­ness and mak­ing sure we get the fan ex­pe­ri­ence plans in place,” he said.</p>
    <p>“The pan­demic has af­fected ev­ery­one – and of course our project is not im­mune. How­ever, prepa­ra­tions have con­tin­ued and we have taken all the nec­es­sary health and safety mea­sures.”</p>
