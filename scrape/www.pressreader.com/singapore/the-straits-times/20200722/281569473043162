    <p>United States Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump is es­ca­lat­ing ten­sions with state and local au­thor­i­ties by seek­ing to de­ploy more fed­eral agents to Demo­crat-con­trolled cities gripped by protests and spikes in crime. Gov­er­nors and other of­fi­cials called it an elec­tion-year ploy and vowed to pur­sue leg­is­la­tion or law­suits to stop him.</p>
    <p>WASH­ING­TON • US Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump is es­ca­lat­ing ten­sions with state and local au­thor­i­ties by seek­ing to de­ploy more fed­eral agents to cities gripped by protests and spikes in crime, a pol­icy that ap­peals to his Repub­li­can base ahead of the Novem­ber elec­tion but faces le­gal chal­lenges.</p>
    <p>With mil­i­tary-clad agents al­ready sweep­ing through the streets of Port­land in Ore­gon, more units were poised to head to Chicago, and Mr Trump sug­gested he would do the same for New York, Philadel­phia, Detroit and other ur­ban cen­tres con­trolled by Democrats.</p>
    <p>Gov­er­nors and other of­fi­cials re­acted an­grily to the Pres­i­dent’s moves, call­ing it a elec­tion-year ploy as they squared off over crime, civil lib­er­ties and local con­trol that has spread from Port­land to cities across the country.</p>
    <p>The local of­fi­cials have com­pared his ac­tions to au­thor­i­tar­i­an­ism and vowed to pur­sue leg­is­la­tion or law­suits to stop him.</p>
    <p>Trail­ing badly in the polls with just over 100 days un­til the Nov 3 elec­tion, Mr Trump as­sailed the “lib­eral Democrats” run­ning Amer­i­can cities and tied the is­sue to his pre­sump­tive op­po­nent, former vice-pres­i­dent Joe Bi­den.</p>
    <p>“I’m go­ing to do something – that, I can tell you,” Mr Trump told re­porters in the Oval Of­fice on Mon­day. “Be­cause we’re not go­ing to let New York and Chicago and Philadel­phia and Detroit and Bal­ti­more and all of these – Oak­land is a mess. We’re not go­ing to let this hap­pen in our country. All run by lib­eral Democrats.”</p>
    <p>He por­trayed the na­tion’s cities as out of con­trol. “Look at what’s go­ing on – all run by Democrats, all run by very lib­eral Democrats. All run, re­ally, by rad­i­cal left,” Mr Trump said. He added: “If Bi­den got in, that would be true for the country. The whole country would go to hell. And we’re not go­ing to let it go to hell.”</p>
    <p>Democrats said the Pres­i­dent was the one who was out of con­trol.</p>
    <p>Sen­a­tor Jeff Merkley of Ore­gon said he would in­tro­duce leg­is­la­tion to limit the role of fed­eral agents in cities like Port­land. “This isn’t just an Ore­gon cri­sis,” he said. “It’s an Amer­i­can cri­sis. We need to stop Trump be­fore this spreads.”</p>
    <p>Clad in cam­ou­flage, fed­eral agents in Port­land have snatched pro­test­ers off the streets and thrown them into un­marked ve­hi­cles with­out ex­plain­ing why they were be­ing de­tained or ar­rested, ac­cord­ing to some of those who have been seized.</p>
    <p>Ore­gon Gov­er­nor Kate Brown has called it “a bla­tant abuse of power”, and Port­land Mayor Ted Wheeler called it “an at­tack on our democracy”. And the state’s at­tor­ney-gen­eral has filed a law­suit seek­ing a re­strain­ing or­der against the fed­eral agents for what she called un­law­ful tac­tics.</p>
    <p>The Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion now plans to de­ploy about 150 Home­land Se­cu­rity In­ves­ti­ga­tions spe­cial agents to Chicago, Illi­nois, in the com­ing days, ac­cord­ing to an of­fi­cial di­rectly in­volved in the op­er­a­tions. The spe­cial agents are ex­pected to be in the city for at least 60 days to help com­bat vi­o­lence and would be un­der the di­rec­tion of the Jus­tice De­part­ment.</p>
    <p>Some cities have seen higher lev­els of crime since the protests over Mr Ge­orge Floyd’s death while in po­lice cus­tody in Min­neapo­lis, but no pres­i­dent in mod­ern times has threat­ened to send in fed­eral law en­force­ment over local op­po­si­tion.</p>
    <p>Mayor Lori Light­foot of Chicago made clear on Mon­day that the fed­eral agents would be no more wel­come in her city than they have been in Port­land.</p>
    <p>“We don’t need fed­eral agents with­out any in­signia tak­ing people off the street and hold­ing them, I think, un­law­fully,” she said at a morn­ing news con­fer­ence.</p>
    <p>The De­part­ment of Home­land Se­cu­rity as­serted that it was act­ing within the law, with Mr Chad Wolf, the de­part­ment’s act­ing sec­re­tary, mak­ing clear that he had no in­ten­tion to pull back.</p>
    <p>“I don’t need in­vi­ta­tions by the state, state may­ors, or state gov­er­nors to do our job,” Mr Wolf said on Fox News. “We’re go­ing to do that, whether they like us there or not.”</p>
