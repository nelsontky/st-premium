Nationwide, more than 71,000 new cases were reported on Wednesday, the nation’s highesteve­r daily total, according to Worldomete­r. The death toll currently stands at more than 140,000 and over 3.6 million people infected.
A total of 28 states have regis- tered record daily increases in cases this month, many of them more than once, and 11 states have reported a greater number of deaths for a single day than ever before.
An influentia­l mortality model developed by the University of Washington’s Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation projected late on Tuesday that the US death toll from Covid-19 would surpass 224,000 by Nov 1, up 16,000 from a prior forecast. But it also said the number of lives lost could be reduced by 40,000 if nearly all Americans wore masks in public. AGENCE FRANCE-PRESSE, REUTERS With the population back on the streets and the borders with Europe and a dozen other countries now open, there has been a resurgence of coronaviru­s infections in Spain.
In areas where recent outbreaks have reached worrying levels, the authoritie­s have made mask-wearing compulsory in public at all times, even if the safety distance can be respected.
Even so, the government has ruled out any renewal of a nationwide lockdown imposed during the state of emergency that was declared on March 14, saying the regional health authoritie­s will be able to control outbreaks.

They also suggested that hospital ICUs might have been under greater pressure early in the pandemic.
Doctors have reported progress in learning enough about the highly contagious virus to have a better grasp of key problems for many patients, although much work remains to be done on the developmen­t of treatments and preventive vaccines.
The researcher­s said their findings could reflect the time for long ICU stays to show up in the data, noting that nearly a third of United Kingdom ICU admissions lasted more than 28 days, and 9 per cent lasted more than 42 days.
The authors emphasised that the recent Covid-19 ICU mortality rate of around 40 per cent is still much higher than the 22 per cent for other viral pneumonias.
“Optimistic­ally, as the pandemic progresses, we may be coping better with Covid-19,” they said. REUTERS PRINTED AND DISTRIBUTE­D BY PRESSREADE­R PressReade­r.com +1 604 278 4604 ORIGINAL COPY .
