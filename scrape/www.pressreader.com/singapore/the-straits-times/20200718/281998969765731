    </section>

    <p>Just six months ago, In­done­sia’s Pres­i­dent Joko Wi­dodo seemed to be rid­ing high. Af­ter be­ing re-elected with an in­creased mar­gin of vic­tory last year, he had cor­ralled three-quar­ters of the Par­lia­ment into his rul­ing coali­tion and was pre­par­ing a wide-rang­ing new “om­nibus law” de­signed to kick the econ­omy into high gear.</p>
    <p>The Covid-19 pan­demic has dealt a heavy blow to his am­bi­tious plans. It has strained the un­der-re­sourced health sys­tem, forced mil­lions of In­done­sians out of work and is threat­en­ing the worst eco­nomic crunch since the Asian fi­nan­cial cri­sis of 1997-98.</p>
    <p>More wor­ry­ingly, the deep­en­ing health and eco­nomic cri­sis has ex­posed short­com­ings in In­done­sia’s lead­er­ship. Jokowi, as he is pop­u­larly known, has be­come in­creas­ingly re­liant on per­sonal in­stincts over tech­ni­cal ex­per­tise. He seems driven by day-to-day tac­tics rather than long-term strat­egy. And his gov­ern­ment has shown grow­ing dis­trust to­wards civil so­ci­ety.</p>
    <p>There are no easy so­lu­tions to the Covid-19 cri­sis but the re­sponse from Jokowi’s ad­min­is­tra­tion has been de­layed, dis­jointed and de­fi­cient. The Pres­i­dent ini­tially brushed off the risks of the pan­demic, say­ing he did not want to cause “panic”. In­done­sia has been slow to ramp up test­ing, and its public mes­sag­ing has been con­fus­ing, caught be­tween the need to pro­mote so­cial dis­tanc­ing and the need to keep the econ­omy mov­ing.</p>
    <p>The gov­ern­ment has also shown a wor­ry­ing dis­re­gard for science, with Jokowi claim­ing that there is no ev­i­dence that lock­downs work and his min­is­ters var­i­ously pro­mot­ing prayer and a neck­lace made of eu­ca­lyp­tus as de­fences against Covid-19.</p>
    <p>These fac­tors have con­trib­uted to a steadily ris­ing case load and death toll, in what is now one of Asia’s worst out­breaks. While other coun­tries are try­ing to stave off their sec­ond wave, In­done­sia is still in the midst of its first wave. Around 4,000 peo­ple are known to have died al­ready, out of more than 80,000 con­firmed cases. The real fig­ures are likely to be sev­eral times higher but In­done­sia’s lim­ited test­ing ca­pac­ity means that many Covid-19 cases and deaths go un­recorded.</p>
    <p>The de­te­ri­o­rat­ing sit­u­a­tion ap­pears to have shaken the Pres­i­dent into ac­tion in the last few weeks. In re­cent Cabi­net meet­ings, Jokowi has made a public show of be­rat­ing his min­is­ters for their poor per­for­mance. In typ­i­cal fash­ion for a leader who styles him­self as a man of ac­tion, Jokowi told of­fi­cials to “work harder and quicker” to tackle the coro­n­avirus out­break and dis­trib­ute so­cial as­sis­tance. But, given the ex­tent of the cri­sis, more of the same will not cut it. Jokowi needs to take a dif­fer­ent path to help In­done­sia through these dif­fi­cult days and to sal­vage his sec­ond and fi­nal term in of­fice.</p>
    <p>Ev­ery world leader has strug­gled to find a bal­ance be­tween sup­press­ing the coro­n­avirus and main­tain­ing eco­nomic growth. This prob­lem is es­pe­cially acute in In­done­sia, where 80 per cent of the pop­u­la­tion are fi­nan­cially in­se­cure, of­ten work­ing in the in­for­mal sec­tor, and have min­i­mal sav­ings and lim­ited so­cial safety nets.</p>
    <p>Some an­a­lysts have ar­gued that In­done­sia lacks the fi­nan­cial fire­power to mount a more com­pre­hen­sive re­sponse to the cri­sis. Of course, it could not af­ford the sort of eco­nomic bailouts that many de­vel­oped coun­tries have of­fered their com­pa­nies and work­ers. But there is much more that can be done through bet­ter lead­er­ship and clearer public com­mu­ni­ca­tion.</p>
    <p>The Pres­i­dent needs a new ap­proach to pol­i­cy­mak­ing, driven more by ev­i­dence from ex­perts and less by the whims of his mot­ley po­lit­i­cal coali­tion.</p>
    <p>In the last few weeks, his gov­ern­ment wasted time and en­ergy push­ing, and then aban­don­ing, a par­lia­men­tary Bill de­signed to pro­mote the na­tional ide­ol­ogy, Pan­casila. Crit­ics have said the Bill was a sop to Jokowi’s party chief Me­gawati Sukarnop­u­tri, who heads an agency in charge of pro­mot­ing Pan­casila and whose fa­ther Sukarno crafted the con­cept.</p>
    <p>In­stead of be­ing dis­tracted by such is­sues, Jokowi needs to de­velop a strate­gic plan for the way for­ward, sup­ported by a bu­reau­cratic ma­chin­ery to im­ple­ment, mon­i­tor and en­force it.</p>
    <p>There is also a need to rein in the po­lice, who have in­creas­ingly gone af­ter the gov­ern­ment’s crit­ics, and the on­line “buzzers”, as they are known in In­done­sia, who launch sus­tained per­sonal at­tacks on those who crit­i­cise the Pres­i­dent’s poli­cies on so­cial me­dia.</p>
    <p>In­stead, Jokowi should re-em­brace the smart, com­mit­ted ac­tivists who helped him win the pres­i­dency and can help drive In­done­sia for­ward again.</p>
    <p>As a sym­bolic marker of this new ap­proach, he should con­sider putting on hold, or even aban­don­ing, plans to build a costly new cap­i­tal city in the jun­gles of Kal­i­man­tan. Rather than spend­ing pre­cious funds on this ques­tion­able project, he should fo­cus on ex­pand­ing and im­prov­ing public health­care and as­sis­tance pro­grammes for vul­ner­a­ble peo­ple. While Jokowi sees the new cap­i­tal as a sym­bol of progress, In­done­sia would be bet­ter served by more con­crete mea­sures to boost the econ­omy.</p>
    <p>For ex­am­ple, he should pur­sue the bu­reau­cratic re­forms that he has been talk­ing about for years but is yet to de­liver. He will need to start by align­ing his Cabi­net be­hind his chief goal of pro­mot­ing for­eign in­vest­ment. Then he will need to de­velop much bet­ter mech­a­nisms to en­sure that the min­istries work together to sup­port him, rather than seek­ing to un­der­mine his plans. With­out reg­u­la­tory cer­tainty, In­done­sia will strug­gle to at­tract the in­ter­na­tional cap­i­tal and tech­nol­ogy that it sorely needs.</p>
    <p>A for­mer fur­ni­ture fac­tory owner, Jokowi rose to power by pitch­ing him­self as a prac­ti­cal leader who would go to the ground and fix prob­lems as they arose.</p>
    <p>His track record of solid, in­cre­men­tal progress as mayor of Solo and gov­er­nor of Jakarta earned him the pres­i­dency in part be­cause of frus­tra­tion at the in­de­ci­sive and in­ef­fec­tual lead­er­ship of his pre­de­ces­sor, Dr Susilo Bam­bang Yud­hoy­ono.</p>
    <p>In in­ter­views for my forth­com­ing book – Man Of Con­tra­dic­tions: Joko Wi­dodo And The Strug­gle To Re­make In­done­sia – Jokowi told me that this hands-on ap­proach could be scaled up to the na­tional level. But run­ning a sprawl­ing, di­verse and demo­cratic coun­try of 270 mil­lion peo­ple is a very dif­fer­ent chal­lenge from city gov­ern­ment.</p>
    <p>In the first few years of his pres­i­dency, Jokowi was able to make progress by in­ject­ing new en­ergy into gov­ern­ment, us­ing his public pop­u­lar­ity to pres­sure the bu­reau­cracy to per­form bet­ter, and main­tain­ing a tight fo­cus on build­ing in­fra­struc­ture.</p>
    <p>He be­came the “hard-hat pres­i­dent”, trav­el­ling around the coun­try and open­ing new toll roads, power plants and air­ports. But the econ­omy did not surge ahead as he ex­pected, with gross do­mes­tic prod­uct growth coast­ing at around 5 per cent (be­fore the Covid-19 cri­sis), well short of his 7 per cent tar­get.</p>
    <p>The prob­lem, as nu­mer­ous ad­vis­ers and of­fi­cials have said pri­vately, is that Jokowi tends to gov­ern through ac­tion and tac­tics, rather than plan­ning and strat­egy. Even be­fore Covid-19 hit, it was a strug­gle to con­vert his pop­u­lar­ity and os­ten­si­ble par­lia­men­tary back­ing into the trans­for­ma­tive change that In­done­sia needs if it is to re­alise his bold goal to build a pros­per­ous na­tion by 2045.</p>
    <p>This Covid-19-in­duced cri­sis is not an op­por­tu­nity for In­done­sia to make the leap into the big leagues, as it threat­ens to dev­as­tate the lives and the eco­nomic well-be­ing of mil­lions of peo­ple. But it should be a wake-up call for the gov­ern­ment.</p>
    <p>With more than four years left in of­fice, Jokowi still has time. Thanks to his tal­ent for re­tail pol­i­tics, he re­tains the good­will of many In­done­sians and ex­ter­nal part­ners from Sin­ga­pore to Aus­tralia and Ja­pan to the United States.</p>
    <p>Hav­ing ac­cu­mu­lated po­lit­i­cal cap­i­tal for the last six years, he needs to start spend­ing it by pur­su­ing tough bu­reau­cratic and eco­nomic re­forms that some in his coali­tion will re­sist.</p>
    <p>Only then will he be able to build on the progress of his first term and turn his am­bi­tious vi­sion for In­done­sia into an achiev­able goal rather than a dis­tant dream.</p>
