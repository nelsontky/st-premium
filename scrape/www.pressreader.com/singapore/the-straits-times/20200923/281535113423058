    <p>Sin­ga­pore must act now to trans­form its econ­omy or risk los­ing its hub sta­tus and see its busi­nesses’ and work­ers’ com­pet­i­tive edge erode, Trade and In­dus­try Min­is­ter Chan Chun Sing said yes­ter­day. Dig­i­tal trans­for­ma­tion is the key to help­ing the coun­try thrive and tran­scend “the tyranny of ge­og­ra­phy”, he added.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore must act now to trans­form its econ­omy, or risk los­ing its hub sta­tus and see its busi­nesses’ and work­ers’ com­pet­i­tive edge erode, Trade and In­dus­try Min­is­ter Chan Chun Sing said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Com­pa­nies here should not be pre­par­ing to re­turn to busi­ness as usual, he said. In­stead, dig­i­tal trans­for­ma­tion is the key to help­ing the coun­try thrive and tran­scend “the tyranny of ge­og­ra­phy”, said Mr Chan, re­fer­ring to Sin­ga­pore’s small size.</p>
    <p>Now is the time to re-en­gi­neer pro­cesses, build a new econ­omy, and trans­form to cre­ate the right op­por­tu­ni­ties for busi­nesses and peo­ple, said Mr Chan, who was speak­ing at the open­ing of the Fu­ture Econ­omy Con­fer­ence and Ex­hi­bi­tion.</p>
    <p>“Dig­i­tal trans­for­ma­tion will truly un­lock for us the world as our hin­ter­land and mar­ket,” he added. “But that is if we make the right moves now, har­ness the power of dig­i­tal to grow our busi­nesses, drive our eco­nomic re­cov­ery, re­de­fine our com­pet­i­tive­ness and rel­e­vance to the world.”</p>
    <p>More than 1,000 busi­ness lead­ers reg­is­tered for the two-day con­fer­ence, which is be­ing held on­line.</p>
    <p>It is fo­cused on how busi­nesses can re­build in the new nor­mal us­ing dig­i­tal tools such as data an­a­lyt­ics. Its 19 speak­ers in­clude rep­re­sen­ta­tives from United Over­seas Bank, on­line pay­ments gi­ant Pay­Pal and pro­fes­sional ser­vices firm Price­wa­ter­house­Coop­ers, who shared their ex­pe­ri­ences go­ing dig­i­tal.</p>
    <p>At the vir­tual meet­ing, it was also an­nounced that the Sin­ga­pore Busi­ness Fed­er­a­tion and In­fo­comm Me­dia Devel­op­ment Author­ity have re­newed an agree­ment to con­tinue driv­ing dig­i­tal trans­for­ma­tion across the busi­ness com­mu­nity and to po­si­tion firms to seize op­por­tu­ni­ties over the next three years.</p>
    <p>One speaker, Aviva Asia ex­ec­u­tive chair­man Chris Wei, said that mak­ing use of data was key to the in­surance gi­ant’s dig­i­tal strat­egy.</p>
    <p>This has meant us­ing data to make it eas­ier for ex­ist­ing cus­tomers to make claims, and to in­crease op­er­a­tional ef­fi­ciency and achieve growth.</p>
    <p>But to do this, the or­gan­i­sa­tion’s cul­ture had to change, he said, adding that there was a “mas­sive clash of cul­ture” when Aviva first em­barked on its dig­i­tal­i­sa­tion jour­ney.</p>
    <p>“It re­ally does re­quire lead­er­ship, it re­quires a lot of time, a lot of me­di­a­tion, to make sure that pri­or­i­ties are aligned,” said Mr Wei, who is also global chair­man of Aviva Dig­i­tal.</p>
    <p>An­other speaker, Ms Janet Young, who is UOB’s head of group chan­nels and dig­i­tal­i­sa­tion, pointed out that her or­gan­i­sa­tion – like many other es­tab­lished firms here – is no dig­i­tal na­tive.</p>
    <p>“They’re not born dig­i­tal. They’re not dig­i­tal na­tives... But you have to be­come dig­i­tal,” she said.</p>
    <p>In his speech, Mr Chan noted that the pan­demic has ac­cel­er­ated the pace of dig­i­tal­i­sa­tion.</p>
    <p>Go­ing dig­i­tal comes with chal­lenges, but these should not pre­vent the Gov­ern­ment, busi­nesses or in­di­vid­u­als from work­ing to­wards change, he added.</p>
    <p>“Be it dig­i­tal­i­sa­tion or glob­al­i­sa­tion, they re­quire us as in­di­vid­u­als and busi­nesses to ad­just and adapt. To not do so, to re­sist change, in­evitably means that we will be left fur­ther be­hind.”</p>
    <p>He added: “The faster we adapt, the faster we re­cover. There is no place for tread­ing wa­ter and wait­ing for nor­malcy to re­turn. Oth­ers will over­take us, and the op­por­tu­ni­ties will pass us by.”</p>
    <p>The Gov­ern­ment is pro­vid­ing help for busi­nesses through schemes such as the SMEs Go Dig­i­tal pro­gramme for small and medium-sized en­ter­prises. It has also in­tro­duced fi­nan­cial in­cen­tives such as the Dig­i­tal Re­silience Bonus for firms that use dig­i­tal so­lu­tions.</p>
    <p>At the same time, 1,000 dig­i­tal am­bas­sadors have been de­ployed to help the less tech-savvy seg­ments of so­ci­ety keep up.</p>
    <p>Place­ments, trainee­ships and skills up­grad­ing un­der the SGUnited Jobs and Skills Pack­age and other reskilling pro­grammes like the TechSkills Ac­cel­er­a­tor have also been ramped up, Mr Chan said.</p>
    <p>“As our peo­ple gain new skills, the dig­i­tal chal­lenge will be­come less daunt­ing,” he added.</p>
    <p>“And we will be­come more pro­duc­tive, be able to take on higher value-added job roles, gain greater job sat­is­fac­tion and, ul­ti­mately, form the dig­i­tal back­bone that ev­ery com­pany needs to power... busi­ness trans­for­ma­tion.”</p>
    <p>Dig­i­tal trans­for­ma­tion will truly un­lock for us the world as our hin­ter­land and mar­ket. But that is if we make the right moves now, har­ness the power of dig­i­tal to grow our busi­nesses, drive our eco­nomic re­cov­ery, re­de­fine our com­pet­i­tive­ness and rel­e­vance to the world.</p>
