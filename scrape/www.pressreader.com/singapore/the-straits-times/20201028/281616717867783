    <p>The Sin­ga­pore Armed Forces (SAF) is tri­alling less-in­va­sive meth­ods of col­lect­ing sam­ples for Covid-19 test­ing and tests with rapid re­sults as more train­ing re­sumes.</p>
    <p>Self-ad­min­is­tered saliva col­lec­tion and nasal swabs that are less un­com­fort­able as they reach only par­tially up the nose are among the meth­ods be­ing tri­alled in ac­tive SAF units, along with anti­gen rapid tests.</p>
    <p>Anti­gen rapid tests are also be­ing tri­alled at mass events such as con­fer­ences. Par­tic­i­pants must reg­is­ter a neg­a­tive re­sult be­fore be­ing ad­mit­ted.</p>
    <p>Such tests are suited for largescale events, where faster turn­around is crit­i­cal. Th­ese in­clude ba­sic mil­i­tary train­ing grad­u­a­tion pa­rades, which are cur­rently held with­out in­vited guests.</p>
    <p>From this month, all op­er­a­tionally ready na­tional ser­vice­men (NS­men) from the army, as well as their reg­u­lar train­ers, have to un­dergo weekly poly­merase chain re­ac­tion (PCR) tests through the usual nasal swabs dur­ing in-camp train­ing (ICT).</p>
    <p>Se­nior Min­is­ter of State for De­fence Zaqy Mo­hamad said yes­ter­day that mak­ing use of new tests as they be­come avail­able pro­vides NS­men with the as­sur­ance that the SAF is do­ing its ut­most to keep train­ing safe, while al­low­ing them to achieve train­ing ob­jec­tives.</p>
    <p>“We want to cre­ate that safe at­mos­phere and en­vi­ron­ment for our troops to train. But I think what’s more im­por­tant is that if we’re able to pro­vide that safe en­vi­ron­ment, we’re able to train at a much larger scale,” he said, when re­spond­ing to a ques­tion on weekly rou­tine test­ing by the SAF.</p>
    <p>He added that there is no time­line yet for im­ple­ment­ing the less­in­va­sive meth­ods and rapid tests as dif­fer­ent meth­ods may re­quire dif­fer­ent con­sid­er­a­tions.</p>
    <p>Mr Zaqy was speak­ing to re­porters af­ter a visit to the In­fantry Train­ing In­sti­tute at Jurong Camp</p>
    <p>II, where he met NS­men from the 791st Bat­tal­ion, Sin­ga­pore In­fantry Reg­i­ment (791 SIR).</p>
    <p>Anti­gen rapid tests can give re­sults more quickly, are cheaper and are eas­ier to ad­min­is­ter than PCR tests, al­though the lat­ter are more ac­cu­rate and re­main the gold stan­dard for con­firm­ing whether a per­son has Covid-19.</p>
    <p>About 300 full-time na­tional ser­vice­men and reg­u­lars have taken anti­gen rapid tests since last month. About 400 have un­der­gone the saliva col­lec­tion trial.</p>
    <p>The trial for oropha­ryn­geal or mid-turbinate swab­bing, in which a sam­ple is taken from the back of the throat or par­tially up the nose, is in the pipe­line.</p>
    <p>When asked about the use of anti­gen rapid tests, Mr Zaqy said mil­i­tary grad­u­a­tion cer­e­monies or pass­ing out pa­rades could be pos­si­ble events for ap­ply­ing the tests.</p>
    <p>“How far, how soon, I think it’s still some­thing we are eval­u­at­ing – th­ese tri­als are un­der way... But be­fore we roll out (a test), I think we have to make sure that it is ef­fec­tive and meets our pur­poses.”</p>
    <p>Mr Zaqy dis­closed that the SAF has not had any Covid-19 in­fec­tion dur­ing ICT so far.</p>
    <p>It will con­tinue to re­sume more of such train­ing as test­ing ca­pac­ity im­proves, he said, adding that the num­ber of ICTs is now at about 50 per cent of the usual level.</p>
    <p>About 600 NS­men from 791 SIR took the rou­tine nasal swab test as they booked into camp for their two-week train­ing which be­gan on Mon­day.</p>
    <p>Cor­po­ral First Class (NS) R. Hariprasat­h said that when he was first called up, he was a lit­tle wor­ried about safety. But he felt re­as­sured af­ter see­ing the mea­sures in place.</p>
    <p>“I’ve never tried the newer col­lec­tion meth­ods, but I think they are good ideas be­cause the pro­cesses are eas­ier than hav­ing to be swabbed through the nose,” said the 25-year-old lo­gis­tics ex­ec­u­tive.</p>
