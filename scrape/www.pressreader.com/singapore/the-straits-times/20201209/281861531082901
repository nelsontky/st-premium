    <p>While all eyes were glued to the tabling of Malaysia’s cru­cial bud­get in early Novem­ber, the seeds of what could be of greater con­se­quence to the na­tion’s seem­ingly un­end­ing po­lit­i­cal in­trigue were be­ing sown up north.</p>
    <p>Perak Men­teri Be­sar Ah­mad Faizal Azumu’s ouster last Fri­day, fol­low­ing his fail­ure to win a con­fi­dence vote in the state assem­bly, took nearly six weeks of del­i­cate dis­cus­sions be­tween his own al­lies from the Umno state chap­ter and their coun­ter­parts from fierce op­po­si­tion ri­vals Demo­cratic Ac­tion Party (DAP).</p>
    <p>“Up un­til the day of the mo­tion it­self, we weren’t sure if Umno would ac­tu­ally pull the trig­ger,” a source from the op­po­si­tion Pakatan Hara­pan (PH) coali­tion, which in­cludes DAP, told The Straits Times.</p>
    <p>An Umno law­maker had tabled the mo­tion, which saw 24 Perak op­po­si­tion law­mak­ers from PH and 24 Umno as­sem­bly­men vot­ing against Datuk Seri Faizal, who hails from Prime Min­is­ter Muhyid­din Yassin’s Parti Pribumi Ber­satu Malaysia.</p>
    <p>Umno had stewed in anger for months over the Ber­satu deputy pres­i­dent’s uni­lat­eral ap­proach to gov­ern­ing and his at­tempts to force a schism in the largest mem­ber of his ad­min­is­tra­tion.</p>
    <p>The op­po­si­tion’s nat­u­ral en­mity to a sit­ting head of gov­ern­ment was deep­ened by the fact that Mr Faizal had de­fected from PH in March, de­spite hav­ing been their chief min­is­ter fol­low­ing the 2018 gen­eral elec­tion.</p>
    <p>The care­fully or­ches­trated con­fi­dence vote that top­pled Mr Faizal took a long ges­ta­tion pe­riod due to scep­ti­cism on both sides at bit­ing the for­bid­den fruit.</p>
    <p>But after their over­whelm­ing suc­cess in boot­ing out Mr Faizal – who se­cured only 10 votes – PH strate­gists be­lieve it could be the first of three po­ten­tial phases of co­op­er­a­tion be­tween the un­likely cou­ple who are the two largest par­ties not just in the Perak leg­is­la­ture, but also the fed­eral Par­lia­ment.</p>
    <p>The next prob­lem is to set up a sta­ble gov­ern­ment as snap polls are un­de­sir­able, given Malaysia is still in the midst of its worst wave of coro­n­avirus in­fec­tions.</p>
    <p>An Umno-PH gov­ern­ment – it is learnt the three par­ties in the op­po­si­tion pact will act en bloc – re­mains a dark-horse out­come, but it could even lead to an elec­toral pact in Perak when ex­pected polls are called after the pan­demic eases.</p>
    <p>Should these two boxes be ticked, it would have na­tional ram­i­fi­ca­tions, po­ten­tially break­ing up Tan Sri Muhyid­din’s al­ready shaky Perikatan Na­sional (PN) pact that con­trols only 112 seats in the 220-strong Par­lia­ment.</p>
    <p>Just as with Perak, Umno has been dis­grun­tled over hav­ing to play sec­ond fid­dle to Ber­satu at the fed­eral level, even to the ex­tent of flirt­ing with back­ing op­po­si­tion leader An­war Ibrahim to re­place Ber­satu chief Mr Muhyid­din.</p>
    <p>A PH of­fi­cial told The Straits Times “it would be nearly im­pos­si­ble to take back fed­eral gov­ern­ment if PN en­ters the next elec­tion as a united al­liance. What­ever the dam­age we would suf­fer for work­ing with Umno, at least we have a chance if the Umno-led Barisan Na­sional coali­tion clashes with the rest of PN”.</p>
    <p>Those in Datuk Seri An­war’s camp also be­lieve that the ouster of Mr Faizal, and more so a pos­si­ble deal with Umno to form gov­ern­ment, could re­vive his hopes of a sim­i­lar out­come at the fed­eral level and end his 22-year wait to be­come prime min­is­ter after be­ing sacked as deputy premier in 1998.</p>
    <p>Umno, led by pres­i­dent Zahid Hamidi, has twice been granted an au­di­ence by the Perak Palace to present its claim to lead a new gov­ern­ment. But the blow to their deputy pres­i­dent has left Ber­satu un­will­ing to back an Umno re­place­ment.</p>
    <p>Zahid has said Umno is open to form­ing gov­ern­ment with all par­ties while Perak DAP chief Nga Kor Ming has re­peat­edly ex­pressed a will­ing­ness to put aside dif­fer­ences in the pub­lic in­ter­est.</p>
    <p>Both Zahid’s camp in Umno as well as Perak DAP have suf­fered back­lash in­ter­nally over their courtship, lead­ing Mr Nga to is­sue sev­eral ex­pla­na­tions.</p>
    <p>“Perak DAP’s readi­ness to co­op­er­ate with Umno proves... scare­mon­ger­ing that DAP is ‘anti-Malay or anti-Is­lam’ is com­pletely un­true.</p>
    <p>“It must be stressed... the main prin­ci­ple is to form a mul­tira­cial gov­ern­ment that is clean, with in­tegrity and guided by ‘good gov­er­nance’,” said Mr Nga.</p>
    <p>Al­ready, the new-found love be­tween these two old foes has been con­ta­gious enough for Umno’s Jo­hor Chief Min­is­ter Hasni Muham­mad to un­prece­dent­edly hand op­po­si­tion as­sem­bly­men RM200,000 each for con­stituency spend­ing, re­sult­ing in the state bud­get be­ing unan­i­mously passed on Sun­day.</p>
    <p>This is de­spite his gov­ern­ment hold­ing only 29 of the 56 seats in the assem­bly where Umno and DAP are the largest par­ties.</p>

Mr Nga says his party&#x2019;s readi&#xAD;ness to co&#xAD;op&#xAD;er&#xAD;ate with Umno is mainly to form a clean, mul&#xAD;tira&#xAD;cial gov&#xAD;ern&#xAD;ment.</p>
