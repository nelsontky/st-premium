    <p>Two decades into the 21st cen­tury, the main chal­lenge it holds for the West has be­come clear: the re­turn of China to cen­tre stage.</p>
    <p>Af­ter manag­ing phase one of China’s re­form well from 1980 to this year – a pe­riod in which China fought no wars – the West is set­ting it­self up for fail­ure in phase two.</p>
    <p>It is a fail­ure re­sult­ing from three flawed as­sump­tions.</p>
    <p>The first – and most em­bed­ded in Western minds – is that China can­not pos­si­bly be a good part­ner as long as it is ruled by the Chi­nese Com­mu­nist Party (CCP).</p>
    <p>Com­mu­nism was sup­posed to have been swept into the dust­bin of his­tory af­ter the col­lapse of the Soviet Union in the late 1980s. So, the ar­gu­ment goes, how can the world work with an op­pres­sive party that rules against the wis­dom of the Chi­nese peo­ple?</p>
    <p>Yet there is plenty of ev­i­dence to sug­gest most Chi­nese peo­ple do not per­ceive the CCP to be op­pres­sive. In fact, the lat­est Edel­man Trust Barom­e­ter re­port sug­gests that sup­port for the Chi­nese gov­ern­ment is among the high­est in the world.</p>
    <p>Chi­nese-Amer­i­can psy­chol­ogy re­searcher Jean Fan from Stan­ford Univer­sity ob­served, af­ter vis­it­ing the coun­try last year, that “China is chang­ing... fast, in a way that is al­most in­com­pre­hen­si­ble with­out see­ing it in per­son. In con­trast to Amer­ica’s stag­na­tion, China’s cul­ture, self-con­cept and morale are be­ing trans­formed at a rapid pace – mostly for the bet­ter.”</p>
    <p>De­spite all this, few Western minds can es­cape from the sec­ond flawed as­sump­tion: Even if most Chi­nese peo­ple are happy with the Com­mu­nist party, they and the rest of the world would be bet­ter off were they to switch im­me­di­ately to a demo­cratic sys­tem.</p>
    <p>Un­til the col­lapse of the Soviet Union and the sub­se­quent im­plo­sion of the liv­ing stan­dards of the Rus­sians, some Chi­nese may have be­lieved in an in­stant trans­for­ma­tion to democ­racy. Now, many have no doubt that a weak cen­tral gov­ern­ment will re­sult in mas­sive chaos and suf­fer­ing for the Chi­nese peo­ple.</p>
    <p>For ev­i­dence, they look to 4,000 years of Chi­nese his­tory and, par­tic­u­larly, the so-called “cen­tury of hu­mil­i­a­tion” that China suffered from 1842 to 1949.</p>
    <p>More­over, a demo­crat­i­cally elected gov­ern­ment is not nec­es­sar­ily a lib­eral one. The demo­crat­i­cally elected In­dian prime min­is­ter Jawa­har­lal Nehru seized back the Por­tuguese colony of Goa in 1961, against the protests of then US Pres­i­dent John F. Kennedy and Bri­tish Prime Min­is­ter Harold Macmillan.</p>
    <p>A demo­cratic China would prob­a­bly be even less pa­tient in dealing with Hong Kong and Tai­wan. A demo­crat­i­cally elected Chi­nese gov­ern­ment would also be loath to be seen as weak in dealing with sep­a­ratist move­ments in Xin­jiang – look at the In­dian gov­ern­ment’s crack­down in Kash­mir.</p>
    <p>In­deed, none of China’s neigh­bours, not even the big­gest democ­ra­cies in Asia, are push­ing for regime change in Bei­jing. A sta­ble, pre­dictable China, even as it be­comes more as­sertive, is prefer­able to the al­ter­na­tive.</p>
    <p>The third flawed as­sump­tion may be the most dan­ger­ous: that a demo­cratic China would in­evitably ac­cept Western norms and prac­tices, and hap­pily be­come a mem­ber of the Western-plus club, as Ja­pan has done.</p>
    <p>That is not the cul­tural dy­namic that is sweep­ing through Asia. Both Turkey and In­dia are friends of the West. Yet Turkey has shifted from the sec­u­lar ide­ol­ogy of its first pres­i­dent, Mustafa Ke­mal Ataturk, to the Is­lamic one of its cur­rent head, Pres­i­dent Re­cep Tayyip Er­do­gan. And In­dia has moved from the An­glophilic Nehru to the Hindu devo­tee Naren­dra Modi.</p>
    <p>We must ac­knowl­edge that a tsunami of de-West­ern­i­sa­tion is un­der way. Even more sig­nif­i­cantly, when Mr Er­do­gan an­nounces the con­ver­sion of the Ha­gia Sophia to a mosque and Mr Modi res­ur­rects a long-lost Hindu tem­ple on a con­tested re­li­gious site, they are sig­nalling a de­sire to re­turn to pre-Western cul­tural roots.</p>
    <p>Napoleon was right when he warned Western na­tions to “let China sleep, for when she wakes, she will shake the world”.</p>
    <p>Even more than in Turkey and In­dia, there is a po­ten­tial vol­cano of anti-Western sen­ti­ment wait­ing to ex­plode in China. Cur­rently, the only po­lit­i­cal force strong enough to hold down these forces of Chi­nese na­tion­al­ism is the CCP.</p>
    <p>The suc­ces­sor to the party could well be far less ra­tional. Keep that in mind, in­stead of pro­ceed­ing on au­topi­lot with cur­rent poli­cies to­wards China.</p>
    <p>The time has come for the West to do a com­plete re­boot and re­con­sider all its fun­da­men­tal premises on China. Western gov­ern­ments should learn to live and work with the Chi­nese lead­er­ship, in­stead of wish­ing for its trans­for­ma­tion or early demise.</p>
