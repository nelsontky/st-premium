    <p>LOS AN­GE­LES • Alex Tre­bek (left), whose decades as host of the quiz show Jeop­ardy! made him one of the most pop­u­lar fix­tures on Amer­i­can tele­vi­sion, died on Sun­day at age 80.</p>
    <p>Tre­bek had waged a very pub­lic fight against pan­cre­atic can­cer for nearly two years, but con­tin­ued tap­ing his pro­gramme un­til re­cently.</p>
    <p>His death was an­nounced on Twit­ter by the Jeop­ardy! ac­count, which said Tre­bek “passed away peace­fully at home early this morn­ing, sur­rounded by fam­ily and friends”, adding: “Thank you, Alex.”</p>
    <p>CNN me­dia an­a­lyst Brian Stel­ter called Tre­bek “the great­est game-show host of his gen­er­a­tion... You al­ways watched and you came away smarter”.</p>
    <p>Tre­bek, who be­came a United States cit­i­zen in 1998, had hosted Jeop­ardy! – syn­di­cated th­ese days to var­i­ous chan­nels, in­clud­ing ABC – since 1984.</p>
    <p>Mr Bob Iger, chief ex­ec­u­tive of­fi­cer of ABC par­ent The Walt Dis­ney Com­pany, called Tre­bek “a friend, a col­league, an icon” in a state­ment mourn­ing his death.</p>
    <p>Tre­bek pre­vi­ously hosted other game shows, in­clud­ing Dou­ble Dare and Clas­sic Con­cen­tra­tion, as well as host­ing the National Geo­graphic Bee for 25 years.</p>
    <p>But it was his time at Jeop­ardy! – a 36-year run al­most un­heard of by tele­vi­sion stan­dards – and his clear in­tel­li­gence, gen­tle­manly aplomb and sly good hu­mour that earned him the eter­nal de­vo­tion of mil­lions of view­ers.</p>
    <p>He also won a slew of awards. Tre­bek was a five-time day­time Emmy Award win­ner. He had a star on the Hol­ly­wood Walk of Fame.</p>
    <p>He re­ceived a flood of sup­port­ive mail af­ter an­nounc­ing his stage 4 can­cer.</p>
    <p>“I’m go­ing to fight this,” he told his fans. Many wrote to tell him they were in­spired by his bat­tle.</p>
    <p>He had had ear­lier health scares, in­clud­ing two heart at­tacks and a car ac­ci­dent, but al­ways came back.</p>
    <p>Ge­orge Alexan­der Tre­bek was born on July 22, 1940, in Sud­bury, On­tario, Canada. His fa­ther was a Ukrainian im­mi­grant, his mother a French-speak­ing Cana­dian. With a de­gree in phi­los­o­phy, he went to work for the Cana­dian Broad­cast­ing Corporatio­n in 1961. By 1966, he was host­ing a high-school quiz show.</p>
    <p>Tre­bek moved to the US in 1973 to host a new NBC game show, The Wiz­ard Of Odds. He took over the reins at Jeop­ardy! in 1984, when a friend of his, orig­i­nal host Art Flem­ing, de­clined to re­turn.</p>
    <p>Tre­bek held the record for the most game-show episodes hosted by the same pre­sen­ter, at 6,829, ac­cord­ing to Va­ri­ety.</p>
    <p>“You work hard, you do your best,” he said with typ­i­cal mod­esty at one awards show.</p>
    <p>He and his wife Jean Cur­rivan had two chil­dren.</p>
