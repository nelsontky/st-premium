    <p>“If we oc­cupy the Capi­tol build­ing, there will be no vote,” one user on the pro-Trump fo­rum The Don­ald wrote on Tues­day, a day be­fore hun­dreds of ex­trem­ists stormed the Capi­tol to at­tempt ex­actly that.</p>
    <p>“Gotta over­whelm those bar­ri­cades and cops,” an­other user replied. Oth­ers chimed in on the dis­cus­sion, sug­gest­ing they could en­ter us­ing side doors for visi­tors or in­fil­trate the tun­nels be­neath the Capi­tol, which can be reached via street en­trances they iden­ti­fied from on­line searches.</p>
    <p>Such dis­cus­sions of vi­o­lence took place across pro-Trump groups on Face­book and mes­sag­ing ser­vice Tele­gram, on In­sta­gram and on Trump-friendly so­cial me­dia plat­forms such as Par­ler and The Don­ald, in the lead-up to Jan 6, a self-styled day of reck­on­ing for die-hard Trump fans to “stop the steal”.</p>
    <p>By halt­ing Congress’ ses­sion to count and an­nounce the elec­toral vote tally cer­ti­fied by states, they could stop Congress from cer­ti­fy­ing Pres­i­dent-elect Joe Bi­den’s win and keep Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump in the White House, they rea­soned.</p>
    <p>Ex­perts said the use of these groups high­lights the chal­lenge of con­tain­ing ex­trem­ism on­line, in an un­reg­u­lated me­dia ecosys­tem fu­elled by dis­in­for­ma­tion from ma­lign ac­tors and even po­lit­i­cal lead­ers.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump’s die-hard sup­port­ers pub­licly floated some of the exact tactics used to storm the Capi­tol on Wed­nes­day, in com­ments that fre­quently in­cluded threats to law­mak­ers and sen­ti­ments of self­mar­tyr­dom.</p>
    <p>“If it came down to it I wouldn’t think twice about dy­ing just so my fam­ily and friends can live free,” said one The Don­ald user four days ago.</p>
    <p>An­other replied that “cor­rupt politi­cians” need to “hang for their trea­son”, writ­ing: “Bring the wood, build the gal­lows out­side Congress, be men­tally pre­pared to pull them out and string’em up.”</p>
    <p>Mr Jared Holt, a vis­it­ing re­search fel­low at the At­lantic Council think-tank’s dis­in­for­ma­tion stud­ies cen­tre, the Dig­i­tal Foren­sic Re­search Lab (DFRLab), said: “In re­cent weeks, ex­trem­ists re­peat­edly stated their de­sire for chaos and de­struc­tion at Jan 6 protests in Wash­ing­ton.”</p>
    <p>Sev­eral com­mu­ni­ties mon­i­tored by the DFRLab had dis­cussed the use of over­whelm­ing crowds to vi­o­late laws and en­ter the Capi­tol, he said on Thurs­day.</p>
    <p>“While ex­trem­ists on the ground live-streamed and bragged about the chaos they cre­ated minute-tominute, far-right on­line com­mu­ni­ties ag­gre­gated their con­tent and cheered on their ef­forts,” he said, adding that some plat­forms had glitches due to over­whelm­ing traf­fic.</p>
    <p>DFRLab di­rec­tor Graham Brookie noted that when Par­ler and The Don­ald briefly went down, ne­ti­zens ad­justed and started post­ing their con­tent on other sites.</p>
    <p>“The mi­gra­tion re­it­er­ates that the chal­lenge of on­line ex­trem­ism is not lim­ited to any one plat­form but rather an en­tire, largely un­reg­u­lated ecosys­tem with very few bar­ri­ers to en­gage or dis­sem­i­nate con­tent,” he said.</p>
    <p>This largely un­reg­u­lated ecosys­tem thus far has kept con­spir­a­cies alive and en­abled ex­trem­ists to be rad­i­calised.</p>
    <p>But the DFRLab re­searchers said that these smaller al­ter­na­tive plat­forms would likely come un­der more scru­tiny from reg­u­la­tors and public of­fi­cials, who have al­ready trained the spotlight on so­cial me­dia gi­ants in con­gres­sional hear­ings in re­cent months.</p>
    <p>“Con­gres­sional hear­ings we have seen with large so­cial me­dia plat­forms are fast com­ing for smaller plat­forms used by ex­trem­ists,” said Mr Brookie. “This is a cross­cut­ting is­sue that touches on home­land se­cu­rity, tech reg­u­la­tion, me­dia stan­dards and many oth­ers, and it has come to a head.”</p>
    <p>But the is­sue goes be­yond so­cial me­dia to the en­tire in­dus­try of fake news, said re­searchers, who also blamed politi­cians for adding fuel to the fire by di­rectly spread­ing dis­in­for­ma­tion.</p>
    <p>Duke Univer­sity public pol­icy pro­fes­sor Phil Napoli, who re­searches so­cial me­dia reg­u­la­tion, said: “It is far more than just a so­cial me­dia prob­lem. It is a prob­lem with our ac­tual elected of­fi­cials be­ing di­rect dis­sem­i­na­tors of dis­in­for­ma­tion. And our tra­di­tional news out­lets – our ca­ble out­lets, Fox News for ex­am­ple, am­pli­fy­ing bla­tant dis­in­for­ma­tion.”</p>
    <p>Florida congressma­n and staunch Trump ally Matt Gaetz, for in­stance, said in Congress on Thurs­day: “Some of the peo­ple who breached the Capi­tol to­day were not Trump sup­port­ers. They were mas­querad­ing as Trump sup­port­ers and, in fact, were mem­bers of the vi­o­lent ter­ror­ist group An­tifa.”</p>
    <p>His source: An ar­ti­cle by the Wash­ing­ton Times con­ser­va­tive news­pa­per which claimed that fa­cial recog­ni­tion com­pany XRVi­sion iden­ti­fied some ri­ot­ers as part of the anti-fas­cist move­ment. XRVi­sion said the ar­ti­cle was false, and it has since been taken down.</p>
    <p>The ef­fect of the sus­pen­sion of Mr Trump’s Face­book ac­count, at least un­til the end of his term, also re­mains to be seen. Twit­ter and Face­book have been the Pres­i­dent’s mega­phone through­out his term, but both com­pa­nies have said he will not be able to use their plat­forms if he con­tin­ues to break the rules.</p>
    <p>Ex­perts have said they are likely to be less le­nient on Mr Trump once he is out of the White House. But if he turns to Par­ler and other smaller plat­forms, he may deepen his sup­port among his loyal fans, at the cost of los­ing the reach and on­line clout that Face­book and Twit­ter granted him.</p>
    <p>One thing is clear: Jan 6 was a day that drove the dev­as­tat­ing, real-world ef­fects of dis­in­for­ma­tion home.</p>
    <p>“Peo­ple were evac­u­ated, held hostage, and ex­pe­ri­enced vi­o­lence over dis­in­for­ma­tion and mis­in­for­ma­tion,” Ms Lisa Kaplan, the founder of the Alethea Group which tracks dis­in­for­ma­tion, wrote on Twit­ter. “Let that sink in.”</p>
