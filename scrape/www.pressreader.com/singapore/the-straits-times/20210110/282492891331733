    <p>Ask al­most any­one and they prob­a­bly know some­one run­ning a home-based busi­ness (HBB), whether as an al­ter­na­tive source of in­come af­ter be­ing re­trenched or an en­tre­pre­neur­ial dream.</p>
    <p>Such en­ter­prises are cer­tainly more vis­i­ble now due to the in­creas­ing use of social me­dia, es­pe­cially dur­ing the Covid-19 pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Ms Me­gan Ong, direc­tor of Nanyang Poly­tech­nic’s Singapore In­sti­tute of Re­tail Stud­ies (Sirs), said that there seems to have been a spike in the num­ber of HBBs com­menc­ing oper­a­tions dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker pe­riod. Be­sides sell­ing food prod­ucts, there have also been more small busi­nesses sell­ing fash­ion and life­style prod­ucts bought cheaply from over­seas, she said.</p>
    <p>She added that a good proxy to es­ti­mate the scale of HBBs is social me­dia, which many rely on to pro­mote their prod­ucts or ser­vices. For ex­am­ple, the In­sta­gram hash­tag #home­basedsg alone has more than 17,000 posts.</p>
    <p>There is no of­fi­cial tally of HBBs, as they do not need a li­cence, but they must fol­low guide­lines from the Hous­ing Board (HDB) and Ur­ban Re­de­vel­op­ment Au­thor­ity (URA).</p>
    <p>For HDB flats, th­ese in­clude not us­ing the flats as a busi­ness ad­dress, not em­ploy­ing any­one from out­side the house­hold, not dis­play­ing any phys­i­cal ad­ver­tis­ing or en­gag­ing in paid ad­ver­tis­ing, and not caus­ing a nui­sance to neigh­bours. Pri­vate res­i­dence ad­dresses can be used for busi­ness reg­is­tra­tion as long as the premises re­main res­i­den­tial.</p>
    <p>HBB ac­tiv­i­ties can in­clude bak­ing, sewing, man­i­cure ser­vices, free­lance writ­ing and pri­vate tu­ition for up to three stu­dents at one time.</p>
    <p>If em­ploy­ees from out­side the house­hold are needed, firms can reg­is­ter with HDB or URA un­der home of­fice schemes to save on rent­ing an of­fice space. Only cer­tain types of busi­nesses are per­mit­ted, such as con­sul­tancy, de­sign and fi­nan­cial plan­ning ser­vices.</p>
    <p>More home of­fices were reg­is­tered last year. HDB said it re­ceived 3,053 new reg­is­tra­tions, up from 2,607 in 2019 and 2,640 in 2018. URA said it re­ceived more than 1,020 new reg­is­tra­tions last year, up from over 680 in 2019 and 580 in 2018.</p>
    <p>The ben­e­fits of HBBs in­clude open­ing up more choices and con­ve­nience to con­sumers and cre­at­ing more op­por­tu­ni­ties for the de­vel­op­ment of new ideas and ex­plo­ration of new ways of run­ning a busi­ness, said Ms Ong.</p>
    <p>“Start­ing an HBB can ben­e­fit fe­male en­trepreneur­s in par­tic­u­lar, es­pe­cially if they are jug­gling work and care­giv­ing du­ties, as they have a test bed for their ideas and strate­gies with­out too many over­heads,” she added.</p>
    <p>With mar­ket­place plat­forms such as Face­book Mar­ket­place, Shopee, Carousell, Lazada and Qoo10, it is easy for HBBs to dis­trib­ute their prod­ucts. They can also make use of social me­dia and word of mouth to mar­ket their busi­nesses for free.</p>
    <p>Ms Sneha Menon, busi­ness ad­viser at the SME Cen­tre @ Singapore Malay Cham­ber of Com­merce and In­dus­try, rec­om­mended main­tain­ing a sim­ple cus­tomer data­base and us­ing a broad­cast list to stay in touch with them. Mak­ing notes us­ing free cal­en­dar soft­ware on spe­cial oc­ca­sions when cus­tomers en­gaged your ser­vices and small ges­tures to re­mem­ber them go a long way in de­vel­op­ing and sus­tain­ing a long-term re­la­tion­ship, she said.</p>
    <p>PO­TEN­TIAL PIT­FALLS</p>
    <p>Be­fore you in­vest your time and money in start­ing an HBB, con­sider the goal.</p>
    <p>If it is go­ing to be­come the main source of in­come, then you will have to start wor­ry­ing about de­mand fluc­tu­a­tions and other things that big­ger com­pa­nies worry about, said Na­tional Univer­sity of Singapore Busi­ness School as­sis­tant pro­fes­sor of strat­egy and pol­icy Ng Weiyi. “The lim­i­ta­tion of the home caps growth,” he added. “If you’re bak­ing cook­ies, you can only ac­com­mo­date so many cook­ies in one oven, you have only so many hours a day, and you have only one pair of hands.”</p>
    <p>It can be hard for some­one try­ing to break into the mar­ket to es­ti­mate de­mand for their goods or ser­vice, which also makes it hard to es­ti­mate how much money to in­vest in the busi­ness or how much help is needed, said Prof Ng.</p>
    <p>Another chal­lenge might be sourc­ing re­li­able sup­pli­ers. Mr An­thony Chai and Ms Jade Ng of in­te­rior de­sign and styling firm House­ofchais, which started as just a per­sonal In­sta­gram record of their home ren­o­va­tion, said that they met with ter­ri­ble sup­pli­ers in the early days of the busi­ness.</p>
    <p>They were stuck with them for an en­tire three­month project and Mr Chai had to per­son­ally help clean up, in­stall items, and drive a lorry to de­liver items, to sal­vage the client’s ex­pe­ri­ence. The firm now makes sure to be highly se­lec­tive of sup­pli­ers.</p>
    <p>When the busi­ness ex­panded and they hired staff, they faced a new set of chal­lenges such as set­ting com­pany cul­ture and train­ing staff. But no prob­lem has been in­sur­mount­able so far, said Mr Chai and Ms Ng. “We ap­proached each prob­lem with a cando at­ti­tude, asked around for ad­vice, and read up to find the best so­lu­tion for the prob­lem.”</p>
    <p>Free ad­vi­sory ser­vices are also avail­able at the 11 SME Cen­tres set up by En­ter­prise Singapore and var­i­ous trade as­so­ci­a­tions and cham­bers. Sirs also of­fers cour­ses such as “dig­i­tal and lead­er­ship skills to ex­cel in the fu­ture of re­tail and busi­ness” and a dig­i­tal men­tor­ship pro­gramme.</p>
