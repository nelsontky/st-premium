    <p>More man­u­fac­tur­ers can get help in their ef­forts to trans­form them­selves to adopt In­dus­try 4.0 so­lu­tions, with a part­ner­ship inked be­tween the Sin­ga­pore Busi­ness Fed­er­a­tion (SBF) and JTC Cor­po­ra­tion yes­ter­day, as part of the In­dus­trial Trans­for­ma­tion Asia-Pa­cific event.</p>
    <p>“This new col­lab­o­ra­tion will al­low JTC and SBF’s com­bined net­work of com­pa­nies to more eas­ily ac­cess rel­e­vant In­dus­try 4.0 re­sources across JTC and SBF’s net­works and plat­forms,” said Trade and In­dus­try Min­is­ter Chan Chun Sing at the sign­ing.</p>
    <p>“To­gether with part­ners, they will also con­duct joint en­gage­ment ses­sions for com­pa­nies, and work closely to share their ex­pe­ri­ence and fur­ther strengthen the var­i­ous ini­tia­tives.”</p>
    <p>In­dus­try 4.0 is about us­ing au­to­ma­tion and smart so­lu­tions to im­prove pro­cesses in man­u­fac­tur­ing.</p>
    <p>Mr Chan said that by com­bin­ing forces, SBF and JTC can con­nect par­tic­i­pat­ing com­pa­nies to a larger pool of tech­nol­ogy part­ners for so­lu­tion match­ing, help­ing com­pa­nies de­velop the know-how to im­ple­ment and scale In­dus­try 4.0 so­lu­tions.</p>
    <p>The ini­tia­tive will also give com­pa­nies ac­cess to rel­e­vant re­sources, in­clud­ing cu­rated work­shops, ca­pa­bil­ity-build­ing ini­tia­tives tai­lored to com­pa­nies’ dig­i­tal readi­ness, and link-ups to a larger pool of tech part­ners such as Siemens, Bosch Rexroth, Kon­ica Mi­nolta and the Sin­ga­pore Pre­ci­sion En­gi­neer­ing and Tech­nol­ogy As­so­ci­a­tion.</p>
    <p>More than 300 com­pa­nies are ex­pected to be sup­ported un­der this ini­tia­tive and un­dergo In­dus­try 4.0 trans­for­ma­tion in the next two years.</p>
    <p>In­dus­try part­ners like trade as­so­ci­a­tions are crit­i­cal in sup­port­ing man­u­fac­tur­ers in trans­for­ma­tion ef­forts, said Mr Chan.</p>
    <p>He cited the ex­am­ple of how JTC rec­om­mended man­u­fac­turer Seng Hua Hng Food­stuff, pop­u­larly known for its Camel Nuts prod­ucts, to par­tic­i­pate in an SBF pro­gramme.</p>
    <p>This helped the com­pany to put in place a dig­i­tal per­for­mance en­gine to en­able real-time data col­lec­tion and mon­i­tor­ing of its au­to­mated pro­duc­tion line.</p>
    <p>“For our man­u­fac­tur­ing sec­tor to re­main glob­ally com­pet­i­tive and con­tinue cre­at­ing qual­ity jobs, busi­nesses must be able to in­te­grate these tech­nolo­gies into their in­no­va­tion and pro­duc­tion pro­cesses,” Mr Chan said.</p>
    <p>“Those that have been able to do so can have greater vis­i­bil­ity and con­trol over their op­er­a­tions, al­low­ing them to re­spond more nim­bly to any changes.”</p>
    <p>He noted that with more than 14,000 in­dus­trial ten­ants, JTC can ef­fec­tively pro­mote trans­for­ma­tion to many com­pa­nies.</p>
    <p>More than 1,000 busi­nesses in JTC’s es­tates have been en­gaged through var­i­ous in­dus­try outreach ini­tia­tives, with about 200 com­pa­nies em­bark­ing on their In­dus­try 4.0 jour­ney.</p>
    <p>JTC chief ex­ec­u­tive Tan Boon Khai said: “With our large base of cus­tomers, strong net­work of part­ners and ro­bust ad­vanced man­u­fac­tur­ing ecosys­tem in Jurong In­no­va­tion District, more com­pa­nies can be­come fore­run­ners in In­dus­try 4.0.</p>
    <p>“With this new part­ner­ship, we hope to see more busi­nesses in Sin­ga­pore trans­form and cap­ture new growth op­por­tu­ni­ties in the re­gion.”</p>
    <p>SBF chief ex­ec­u­tive Ho Meng Kit said: “The Covid-19 sit­u­a­tion has brought dis­rup­tions to economies, mak­ing busi­nesses re­think strate­gies, relook op­er­at­ing mod­els and re­cal­i­brate re­sources. This has led to an ac­cel­er­ated need for a bet­ter un­der­stand­ing and adop­tion of In­dus­try 4.0 to help lo­cal en­ter­prises emerge stronger from the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>“With the present down­turn ex­pected to be pro­tracted, we hope that through this JTC-SBF part­ner­ship, we can fur­ther en­cour­age more com­pa­nies to take a holis­tic view of how In­dus­try 4.0 so­lu­tions can help their busi­nesses trans­form and thrive in the fu­ture econ­omy.”</p>
    <p>GREATER CON­TROL WITH TECH</p>
    <p>For our man­u­fac­tur­ing sec­tor to re­main glob­ally com­pet­i­tive and con­tinue cre­at­ing qual­ity jobs, busi­nesses must be able to in­te­grate these tech­nolo­gies into their in­no­va­tion and pro­duc­tion pro­cesses. Those that have been able to do so can have greater vis­i­bil­ity and con­trol over their op­er­a­tions, al­low­ing them to re­spond more nim­bly to any changes.</p>
