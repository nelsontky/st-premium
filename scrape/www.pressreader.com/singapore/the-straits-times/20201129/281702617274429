    <p>LON­DON • More than 1,300 peo­ple in Bri­tain were in­ac­cu­rately in­formed they were in­fected with the coro­n­avirus after a lab­o­ra­tory er­ror at the govern­ment’s Na­tional Health Ser­vice Test and Trace sys­tem, the Depart­ment of Health and So­cial Care told Reuters yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>“NHS Test and Trace has con­tacted 1,311 in­di­vid­u­als who were in­cor­rectly told that the re­sult of Covid-19 tests, taken be­tween Nov 19 and Nov 23, were pos­i­tive. An is­sue with a batch of test­ing chem­i­cals meant their test re­sults were void,” a depart­ment spokesman said in an e-mailed state­ment.</p>
    <p>“Swift ac­tion was taken to no­tify those af­fected and they have been asked to take an­other test, and to con­tinue to self-iso­late if they have symp­toms.”</p>
    <p>The lab­o­ra­tory er­ror that led to the prob­lem was an “iso­lated in­ci­dent” and was be­ing in­ves­ti­gated.</p>
    <p>The govern­ment has an­nounced an ex­tra £7 bil­lion (S$12.5 bil­lion) for its Covid-19 test­ing and con­tact trac­ing sys­tem as part of an ex­panded mass test­ing.</p>
    <p>The Test and Trace sys­tem has been heav­ily crit­i­cised after a se­ries of high-pro­file fail­ures since its launch ear­lier this year, and min­is­ters con­cede it has not per­formed as well as they had hoped.</p>
    <p>In Septem­ber, nearly 16,000 pos­i­tive case records were lost from the sys­tem for sev­eral days – caus­ing a de­lay in con­tact trac­ing. The govern­ment blamed a “le­gacy” file sys­tem that cut off records after about 65,000 rows of data.</p>
    <p>The UK has had about 1.6 mil­lion coro­n­avirus cases and over 57,500 deaths, ac­cord­ing to a Reuters tally.</p>
    <p>More than 1.4 mil­lion peo­ple have died since the coro­n­avirus emerged in China late last year, and three drug de­vel­op­ers – Pfizer/BioNTech, Moderna and As­traZeneca/Ox­ford Univer­sity – are seek­ing ap­proval for their vac­cines to be used as early as next month.</p>
    <p>On Fri­day, the Bri­tish govern­ment said it has asked its in­de­pen­dent medicines reg­u­la­tor to as­sess As­traZeneca’s coro­n­avirus vac­cine as part of the for­mal ap­proval process for the drug to be rolled out by the end of the year.</p>
    <p>As­traZeneca has com­pleted phase 3 clin­i­cal tri­als of its vac­cine, the last stage be­fore reg­u­la­tory ap­proval. But un­der Bri­tish rules, the govern­ment must also ask the in­de­pen­dent Medicines and Health­care prod­ucts Reg­u­la­tory Agency to green­light the drug.</p>
    <p>Bri­tain has se­cured ac­cess to 100 mil­lion doses of the vac­cine pro­duced by the Bri­tish drug man­u­fac­turer in part­ner­ship with the Univer­sity of Ox­ford.</p>
    <p>The health depart­ment has said it ex­pects four mil­lion doses of the shot to be ready for Bri­tain by the end of the year and 40 mil­lion by the end of next March.</p>
    <p>As­traZeneca last Thurs­day said fur­ther re­search was needed on the vac­cine, but the ad­di­tional test­ing was un­likely to af­fect the ap­proval process.</p>
    <p>Coun­tries across Europe have been bat­tling a sec­ond wave of in­fec­tions and na­tions are wrestling with how to keep their cit­i­zens safe while al­low­ing them a lit­tle re­lief over the hol­i­days.</p>
    <p>Ahead of Christ­mas, places such as Bel­gium, Ire­land and Italy will ease Covid-19 re­stric­tions to vary­ing de­grees, al­low­ing some shops to re­open and per­mit­ting forms of travel or gatherings.</p>
