    <p>WASH­ING­TON • The Chi­nese am­bas­sador to Wash­ing­ton has said that China’s re­la­tions with the United States were fac­ing “se­vere dif­fi­cul­ties” and the two coun­tries should lose no time in putting them on the right track.</p>
    <p>Am­bas­sador Cui Tiankai on Thurs­day told a vir­tual cer­e­mony to mark China’s Na­tional Day that Bei­jing was will­ing to de­velop re­la­tions with Wash­ing­ton with “good­will and sin­cer­ity”.</p>
    <p>“The China-US re­la­tion­ship is ex­pe­ri­enc­ing se­vere dif­fi­cul­ties rarely seen in the past 41 years of diplo­matic ties,” Mr Cui said.</p>
    <p>He said there were those who were try­ing to stoke eco­nomic de­cou­pling of the two coun­tries and “in­cite ide­o­log­i­cal con­fronta­tion and a new Cold War”.</p>
    <p>“This se­ri­ously un­der­mines the fun­da­men­tal in­ter­ests of the Chi­nese and Amer­i­can peo­ple... We be­lieve that a sound and sta­ble China-US re­la­tion­ship is in the in­ter­ests of both coun­tries,” he said.</p>
    <p>“We are will­ing to de­velop our re­la­tions with the US with good­will and sin­cer­ity, and the two coun­tries should lose no time in tak­ing bi­lat­eral re­la­tions onto the right track, of no con­flict, no con­fronta­tion, mu­tual re­spect and win-win co­op­er­a­tion.”</p>
    <p>Mr Cui’s com­ments come at a time when China-US re­la­tions have sunk to the low­est point in decades in the run-up to Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump’s Nov 3 re­elec­tion bid.</p>
    <p>The world’s two big­gest economies have clashed over is­sues rang­ing from trade and tech­no­log­i­cal ri­valry to the han­dling of the coro­n­avirus pan­demic.</p>
    <p>In an ad­dress to the United Na­tions Gen­eral Assem­bly last week, Mr Trump de­manded that China be held ac­count­able for hav­ing “un­leashed” Covid-19 on the world, while Chi­nese Pres­i­dent Xi Jin­ping called for en­hanced co­op­er­a­tion over the pan­demic and stressed that Bei­jing had no in­ten­tion of fight­ing “ei­ther a Cold War or a hot war with any coun­try”.</p>
