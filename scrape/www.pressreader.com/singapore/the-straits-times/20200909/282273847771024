    <p>ILE DE RE (France) • Ire­land’s Sam Ben­nett com­pleted his set of Grand Tour vic­to­ries when he pre­vailed in the 10th stage of the Tour de France yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The De­ce­un­inck-Quick Step rider, who al­ready had three Giro d’Italia and two Vuelta stage wins to his name, nar­rowly out­sprinted Aus­tralian Caleb Ewan and Slo­vakian Peter Sa­gan for his first vic­tory in cy­cling’s big­gest event.</p>
    <p>“I don’t think it’s hit me. I’m in shock,” a tear­ful Ben­nett said in a TV in­ter­view af­ter­wards. “I want to thank my wife and ev­ery­one around me. You dream of this and you never think it will hap­pen.</p>
    <p>“Sorry, I don’t mean to be a cry­baby.”</p>
    <p>The re­sult also meant the 29-year-old re­claims the green jersey for the points clas­si­fi­ca­tion from three-time world cham­pion Sa­gan. The Bora-Hans­grohe rider is look­ing to win the jersey for a record-ex­tend­ing eighth time, while Ben­nett is hop­ing to be­come the first Ir­ish­man to take the hon­our since Sean Kelly in 1989.</p>
    <p>Jumbo-Visma leader Pri­moz Roglic kept hold of the over­all yel­low jersey, re­main­ing 21 sec­onds ahead of de­fend­ing cham­pion</p>
    <p>Egan Ber­nal of Team Ineos.</p>
    <p>All 22 teams set off af­ter ev­ery rider tested neg­a­tive for coro­n­avirus on Mon­day’s rest day.</p>
    <p>How­ever, deputy race di­rec­tor Fran­cois Le­marc­hand had to wave them off in­stead of his boss Chris­tian Prud­homme, who was put into quar­an­tine for a week af­ter he was in­fected by Covid-19.</p>
    <p>The In­ter­na­tional Cy­cling Union and the or­gan­is­ers said one staff mem­ber each from Cofidis, AG2RLa Mon­di­ale, Ineos and Mitchel­ton-Scott con­tracted the virus.</p>
    <p>French Prime Min­is­ter Jean Cas­tex will also be tested as he was in the car of Prud­homme, who is asymp­to­matic, as they fol­lowed the eighth stage on Satur­day.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to the rules, should two mem­bers of a team, rid­ers or staff, test pos­i­tive for the virus, the whole out­fit will be kicked out.</p>
