    <p>En­sur­ing that se­niors are not lag­ging be­hind as pub­lic ser­vices in­creas­ingly move on­line, and mak­ing sure that there is suf­fi­cient aid for the lower-in­come and vul­ner­a­ble in so­ci­ety were among the is­sues raised by par­tic­i­pants in the lat­est Sin­ga­pore To­gether Emerg­ing Stronger Con­ver­sa­tions (ESC) ses­sion yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The ses­sion in Man­darin was the first one to be held in a mother tongue lan­guage. There will be an­other ses­sion in Tamil on Nov 28, and an­other one in Malay at a later date to be con­firmed. The pre­vi­ous 11 sessions in the series, which started in June, were in English.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day’s ses­sion in­volved 50 par­tic­i­pants and was hosted by Min­is­ter for Sus­tain­abil­ity and the En­vi­ron­ment Grace Fu and Se­nior Min­is­ter of State for Health Koh Poh Koon.</p>
    <p>“In the com­ing months, we will hold di­a­logue sessions in Malay and Tamil to lis­ten to more Sin­ga­pore­ans,” said Ms Fu, in her open­ing re­marks in Man­darin.</p>
    <p>She em­pha­sised the need for close co­op­er­a­tion be­tween the Gov­ern­ment and the pub­lic in build­ing a more re­silient Sin­ga­pore in the new nor­mal. The Gov­ern­ment is lis­ten­ing to peo­ple’s con­cerns and ques­tions, and will re­spond to top­ics dis­cussed dur­ing the sessions, she said.</p>
    <p>She cited the SG To­gether Ac­tion Net­works which bring to­gether the</p>
    <p>Gov­ern­ment, the com­mu­nity and busi­nesses to ad­dress var­i­ous is­sues, such as men­tal health.</p>
    <p>Also speak­ing in Man­darin, Dr Koh said: “Based on the top­ics dis­cussed in the sessions, we will form more ac­tion net­works and part­ner­ships to jointly find and cre­ate so­lu­tions.”</p>
    <p>Not­ing how men­tal health is­sues have be­come more prom­i­nent dur­ing the pandemic, Dr Koh cited the ex­am­ple of the for­ma­tion of the Youth Men­tal Well-be­ing Network in Fe­bru­ary for youth, men­tal health pro­fes­sion­als and par­ents to dis­cuss youth men­tal well-be­ing.</p>
    <p>The other ac­tion net­works cur­rently are the Up­lift­ing Pupils in Life and In­spir­ing Fam­i­lies Task­force that aims to strengthen sup­port for stu­dents from dis­ad­van­taged fam­i­lies; the SG Cares Com­mu­nity Network that brings to­gether 160 gov­ern­ment and com­mu­nity help agencies to help the low-in­come and vul­ner­a­ble; and the Be­yond Covid-19 Task­force formed in May by the Na­tional Coun­cil of So­cial Ser­vice to strengthen the re­silience of the so­cial ser­vice sec­tor.</p>
    <p>At least 20 ESC sessions will be or­gan­ised by Fe­bru­ary next year.</p>
    <p>So far, over 1,600 Sin­ga­pore­ans and com­mu­nity part­ners have par­tic­i­pated in the var­i­ous con­ver­sa­tions, dis­cussing the chal­lenges and op­por­tu­ni­ties fac­ing the coun­try in a postCovid-19 world and so­lu­tions to emerge stronger from the cri­sis.</p>
    <p>The sessions will be con­ducted dig­i­tally by de­fault, un­til the sit­u­a­tion al­lows for face-to-face gath­er­ings to take place safely, said the Min­istry of Cul­ture, Com­mu­nity and Youth in a me­dia state­ment.</p>
    <p>Mr Damien Koh, 24, an au­di­tor, was at­tend­ing his sec­ond ESC ses­sion. For him, the ses­sion in Man­darin, which in­volved par­tic­i­pants from dif­fer­ent back­grounds and age groups, brought fresh per­spec­tives on is­sues.</p>
    <p>“It was a more ma­tured age group and they were more fo­cused on self-re­liance, as (mem­bers of) the Merdeka Gen­er­a­tion gen­er­ally have a tougher mind­set. So they gave ad­vice to younger peo­ple like my­self,” he said.</p>
