    <p>The labour move­ment yes­ter­day asked firms to en­sure that work­ers af­fected by re­trench­ments were treated fairly and the Sin­ga­porean core of the work­force kept in­tact.</p>
    <p>Job losses are ex­pected to rise, given the un­cer­tain eco­nomic out­look, the Na­tional Trades Union Congress (NTUC) said.</p>
    <p>“With more re­trench­ments be­com­ing in­evitable in the com­ing months, NTUC calls on com­pa­nies to en­sure open­ness, trans­parency and con­sul­ta­tion with our unions and work­ers,” it said.</p>
    <p>The NTUC asked firms to ob­serve the Fair Re­trench­ment Frame­work, which pro­motes re­spon­si­ble prac­tices for firms lay­ing off staff.</p>
    <p>A key prin­ci­ple of this frame­work is pro­tect­ing the Sin­ga­porean core of the work­force, “with Sin­ga­pore­ans keep­ing their jobs in terms of job pro­tec­tion and re­de­ploy­ment, while due con­sid­er­a­tions are given to for­eign work­ers”, the NTUC said.</p>
    <p>Jobs must be pre­served as far as pos­si­ble, and job sup­port ex­tended, it added.</p>
    <p>Older em­ploy­ees, who may pos­sess skills, ma­tu­rity and ex­pe­ri­ence, should be eval­u­ated on an equal ba­sis, with­out be­ing dis­crim­i­nated against.</p>
    <p>For­eign­ers with spe­cial or crit­i­cal skills could be kept. “Com­pa­nies should also en­sure that these skills are trans­ferred to Sin­ga­pore­ans in the longer term,” it said.</p>
    <p>In a Face­book post, Man­power Min­is­ter Josephine Teo told em­ploy­ers that it is in their own in­ter­est to pre­serve their Sin­ga­porean core, even as they re­trench work­ers.</p>
    <p>“While be­ing fair to all af­fected work­ers, keep in mind how the lo­cal work­ers have con­trib­uted to your pres­ence and past suc­cesses in Sin­ga­pore. As much as Sin­ga­pore wel­comes you to make this the best home for your busi­ness, we need you to make your com­pany the best home for our peo­ple,” she said.</p>
    <p>NTUC has also asked com­pa­nies to avoid re­trench­ments al­to­gether if they can. It added: “Re­trench­ments should be the last re­sort for com­pa­nies.”</p>
    <p>Be­fore that, they should at­tempt other steps such as pay re­duc­tions and job-share ar­range­ments.</p>
    <p>If lay­offs be­come in­evitable, firms should pro­vide fair re­trench­ment pack­ages and pro­cesses, it said.</p>
    <p>Firms should also get on board the NTUC Job Se­cu­rity Coun­cil to pro­vide sup­port to work­ers who may be af­fected by re­trench­ment, and help them seek new em­ploy­ment and train­ing for skills re­quired for new jobs.</p>
    <p>Labour chief Ng Chee Meng noted in a Face­book post yes­ter­day: “I urge all com­pa­nies to work with NTUC and our unions early so that our work­ers can get the best help pos­si­ble in these chal­leng­ing times.”</p>
    <p>Sev­eral com­pa­nies, es­pe­cially those op­er­at­ing in in­dus­tries di­rectly af­fected by the pan­demic, have an­nounced lay­offs in re­cent months.</p>
    <p>In­te­grated re­sort op­er­a­tor Re­sorts World Sen­tosa laid off a re­ported 2,000 em­ploy­ees last week, while hos­pi­tal­ity group Banyan Tree cut 30 per cent of its work­force in Sin­ga­pore last month.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, one of the key gov­ern­ment schemes which have helped stave off re­trench­ments, the Jobs Sup­port Scheme, will be rolled back next month, with the fi­nal pay­out to come in Oc­to­ber.</p>
    <p>The scheme helps to off­set part of the wages of lo­cal em­ploy­ees.</p>
    <p>NTUC has asked firms and unions to work to­gether to ride through the cri­sis and pre­serve em­ploy­ment.</p>
    <p>This could be done by ac­cept­ing cost-cut­ting mea­sures and tap­ping gov­ern­ment as­sis­tance schemes to ease cash flow.</p>
    <p>It also wanted firms to help work­ers tran­si­tion to sec­tors that re­quire man­power.</p>
    <p>In her post, Mrs Teo noted that while em­ploy­ers must be fair to work­ers in han­dling lay­offs, work­ers and unions too need to be fair to em­ploy­ers, hear­ing them out and un­der­stand­ing the sit­u­a­tion, ac­cept­ing re­de­ploy­ment or ne­go­ti­at­ing for a pack­age in good faith.</p>
    <p>The prin­ci­ples in the labour move­ment’s pro­posed fair re­trench­ment frame­work are not new but they will help guide firms when lay­offs be­come in­evitable, ob­servers said.</p>
    <p>The Na­tional Trades Union Congress (NTUC) yes­ter­day urged com­pa­nies to ob­serve fair and re­spon­si­ble prac­tices when lay­ing off em­ploy­ees, em­pha­sis­ing the im­por­tance of pre­serv­ing a Sin­ga­porean core in the work­force.</p>
    <p>Ms Low Peck Kem, pres­i­dent of the Sin­ga­pore Hu­man Re­sources In­sti­tute, out­lined key rea­sons for bosses to treat work­ers fairly, in­clud­ing the im­pact on em­ploy­ees who were spared the chop.</p>
    <p>“When they see that their col­leagues have been fairly re­trenched, and... re­trench­ment is in­deed the last re­sort, they will be thank­ful and work dou­bly hard to cover for a leaner team,” she noted.</p>
    <p>“Sim­i­larly, if the re­trench­ment is poorly man­aged, morale and engagement of re­main­ing staff will be low as they can an­tic­i­pate how badly they will also be treated if they were even­tu­ally re­trenched.”</p>
    <p>Man­power Min­is­ter Josephine Teo said in her Face­book post yes­ter­day that given a choice, most com­pa­nies would avoid lay­ing off work­ers.</p>
    <p>“To stave off re­trench­ment, most com­pa­nies will also do their best to re­de­ploy the staff to other busi­ness units or func­tions. When the in­evitable hap­pens and re­trench­ment can no longer be avoided, fair­ness is an im­por­tant prin­ci­ple,” she said.</p>
    <p>As­so­ci­a­tion of Small and Medium En­ter­prises pres­i­dent Kurt Wee noted that the NTUC’s pro­posed guide­lines are not new and cover prac­tices that com­pa­nies try to ob­serve as much as pos­si­ble.</p>
    <p>He added that small and medi­um­sized en­ter­prises (SMEs) are gen­er­ally aware of the im­por­tance of re­tain­ing their work­force: “Many</p>
    <p>SME em­ploy­ers are not (likely to) ‘hire and fire’, and nor­mally treat their em­ploy­ees like an ex­ten­sion of their own fam­ily unit.”</p>
    <p>But com­pa­nies are wor­ried about the out­look in the com­ing months, es­pe­cially with the last Jobs Sup­port Scheme pay­out com­ing in Oc­to­ber. They fear there may not be suf­fi­cient sup­port to help the busi­ness com­mu­nity sus­tain liveli­hoods, he added.</p>
    <p>Mr Wee ex­pects the sit­u­a­tion will be “much worse” in the third and fourth quar­ters as most firms can cur­rently tap as­sis­tance schemes as a buf­fer and are try­ing their best to min­imise costs.</p>
    <p>Trade and In­dus­try Min­is­ter Chan Chun Sing said in a Face­book post yes­ter­day that while gov­ern­ment mea­sures have helped sup­port busi­nesses and stave off re­trench­ment, some firms in harder-hit sec­tors will have to let some work­ers go in or­der to re­main vi­able.</p>
    <p>Mr Chan urged firms to ap­proach gov­ern­ment eco­nomic agen­cies or the SME Cen­tres for as­sis­tance if they are un­sure of the sup­port that is still avail­able.</p>
    <p>He added that if lay­offs are un­avoid­able, em­ploy­ers must of­fer rea­son­able re­trench­ment pack­ages and en­sure that the process is done in an em­pa­thetic man­ner.</p>
    <p>“It is not suf­fi­cient to pro­tect the liveli­hoods of our work­ers. We must also pro­tect their sense of dig­nity and pride to al­low them to tran­si­tion into the next phase of their ca­reers smoothly,” Mr Chan said.</p>
    <p>Ms Low noted that this is the time for com­pa­nies to in­vest in tech­nol­ogy and train­ing work­ers to be more flex­i­ble and re­silient.</p>
    <p>“While some wel­fare can be re­duced, proac­tive in­vest­ments in help­ing work­ers be ready for the fu­ture would be some­thing we should not cut back on. This is where the frame­work helps in guid­ing com­pa­nies to tap pro­grammes like SG United and tran­si­tion sup­port schemes to keep work­ers afloat,” she said.</p>
    <p>The Sin­ga­pore Na­tional Em­ploy­ers Fed­er­a­tion said in a state­ment: “With the chal­leng­ing eco­nomic en­vi­ron­ment and as busi­nesses trans­form, it may be dif­fi­cult to pre­serve jobs and al­ter­na­tives should be sought, such as re­de­ploy­ing work­ers or to sup­port af­fected work­ers to re­gain em­ploy­ment through train­ing, job match­ing and other as­sis­tance.”</p>
    <p>The fed­er­a­tion will help em­ploy­ers tap var­i­ous schemes so they can man­age costs and trans­form to emerge stronger from the cri­sis, it added.</p>
    <p>Firms are wor­ried about the com­ing months and fear there may not be enough sup­port to help the busi­ness com­mu­nity sus­tain liveli­hoods, said As­so­ci­a­tion of</p>
    <p>Small and Medium En­ter­prises pres­i­dent Kurt Wee.</p>
