    <p>A po­ten­tially sharp re­bound from the gloom and doom of the cir­cuit breaker may prompt a re­vi­sion of the of­fi­cial full-year growth forecast this week, but ex­perts still think 2020 will go down as Sin­ga­pore’s worst re­ces­sion.</p>
    <p>That ex­pected record down­turn also means the Mon­e­tary Author­ity of Sin­ga­pore (MAS) will main­tain its stance of no ap­pre­ci­a­tion of the trade-weighted Sin­ga­pore dol­lar at its mid-year pol­icy re­view to­mor­row.</p>
    <p>While that seems set in stone, econ­o­mists are rapidly re­think­ing the numbers, given the find­ings of a Reuters poll of 11 econ­o­mists.</p>
    <p>Their me­dian forecast is that gross do­mes­tic prod­uct (GDP) could surge 35.3 per cent on a quar­ter-on-quar­ter sea­son­ally ad­justed and an­nu­alised ba­sis in the third quar­ter.</p>
    <p>That GDP re­bound would fol­low the record 42.9 per cent quar­teron-quar­ter plunge in the sec­ond quar­ter that in­cluded the April 7 to June 1 pe­riod of strict re­stric­tions on mo­bil­ity and busi­ness ac­tiv­ity to curb the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore started a grad­ual re­open­ing in June, spark­ing a steady re­cov­ery in eco­nomic ac­tiv­ity.</p>
    <p>GDP will still shrink 6.8 per cent in the third quar­ter from the same pe­riod last year, but that is a stark im­prove­ment on the 13.2 per cent year-on-year con­trac­tion – also the worst ever – in the sec­ond quar­ter, the poll showed.</p>
    <p>The Min­istry of Trade and In­dus­try (MTI) will re­lease ad­vanced es­ti­mates for the July-to-Septem­ber quar­ter to­mor­row, us­ing data gleaned largely from July and Au­gust.</p>
    <p>It nar­rowed its full-year forecast in Au­gust to a range of mi­nus 7 per cent to mi­nus 5 per cent, from an ear­lier prediction of mi­nus 7 per cent to mi­nus 4 per cent.</p>
    <p>Ms Se­lena Ling, head of trea­sury re­search and strat­egy at OCBC Bank, ex­pects MTI to fur­ther com­press its 2020 forecast range, this time to mi­nus 6 per cent to mi­nus 5 per cent.</p>
    <p>Her ex­pec­ta­tion of a full per­cent­age point slice from the grim­mer end of the MTI forecast is based on her own es­ti­mate that GDP will ex­pand a stag­ger­ing 51.5 per cent from the sec­ond to the third quar­ter.</p>
    <p>Man­u­fac­tur­ing, fi­nan­cial ser­vices and the in­fo­comm sec­tor will drive this surge, she added.</p>
    <p>But Ms Ling ex­pects full-year GDP to shrink by about 5.3 per cent amid fur­ther soft­en­ing of the labour mar­ket in the com­ing months.</p>
    <p>Higher un­em­ploy­ment could weigh on con­sumer con­fi­dence and pri­vate con­sump­tion, she said, but noted that gov­ern­ment poli­cies such as the ex­tended Jobs Sup­port Scheme and the loans mora­to­rium will help ward off the worst im­pact.</p>
    <p>DBS Bank se­nior econ­o­mist Irvin Seah said rel­a­tively slower re­cov­ery across most of the ser­vices sec­tor will con­tinue to cap a sharper re­bound.</p>
    <p>He added: “De­spite some respite</p>
    <p>The growth re­cov­ery is on track, while the dis­in­fla­tion­ary pres­sures are grad­u­ally abat­ing. While 2021 may see re­fla­tion­ary pres­sures re­turn­ing, as we tip both head­line and core con­sumer prices to re­turn to pos­i­tive ter­ri­tory, nev­er­the­less, it would be pre­ma­ture to tighten now.</p>
    <p>MS SE­LENA LING, head of trea­sury re­search and strat­egy at OCBC Bank.</p>
    <p>from the re­lax­ation of cir­cuit breaker mea­sures, the ser­vices sec­tor con­tin­ues to strug­gle.”</p>
    <p>Quite a few re­tail and food and bev­er­age busi­nesses have closed down, while con­struc­tion con­tin­ues to face var­i­ous re­stric­tions un­til well into the third quar­ter, with some curbs still in place, he noted.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, tourism and re­lated sec­tors like hos­pi­tal­ity re­main in the dol­drums due to the pro­longed clo­sure of the bor­ders, with most travel re­stric­tions likely to re­main in place at least through this year.</p>
    <p>Mr Seah still ex­pects a 31 per cent quar­ter-on-quar­ter ex­pan­sion, given the bounce-back in man­u­fac­tur­ing from the slump ear­lier in the year with in­dus­trial pro­duc­tion and non-oil do­mes­tic ex­ports both in strong ex­pan­sion mode.</p>
    <p>He es­ti­mates that the year-onyear con­trac­tion in the third quar­ter will be around 7.6 per cent.</p>
    <p>The full-year GDP may shrink by an av­er­age of 6.5 per cent be­fore re­cov­er­ing to pos­i­tive growth of 5.5 per cent next year, Mr Seah added.</p>
    <p>“The worst is over. The sec­ond quar­ter was the bot­tom and the third quar­ter will def­i­nitely be an im­prove­ment, and we should con­tinue to see that im­prove­ment go­ing into the fourth quar­ter and on­wards into 2021,” he said.</p>
    <p>UOB econ­o­mist Barn­abas Gan es­ti­mates a quar­ter-on-quar­ter growth of 38.8 per cent and a yearon-year con­trac­tion of 6.3 per cent in the third quar­ter.</p>
    <p>The prog­no­sis for GDP next year will de­pend on the rate of re­cov­ery for the labour mar­ket by then. For now, the un­em­ploy­ment rate is likely to inch higher, he said.</p>
    <p>All three an­a­lysts agreed that there would be no change in MAS pol­icy to­mor­row.</p>
    <p>OCBC’s Ms Ling said: “The growth re­cov­ery is on track, while the dis­in­fla­tion­ary pres­sures are grad­u­ally abat­ing. While 2021 may see re­fla­tion­ary pres­sures re­turn­ing, as we tip both head­line and core con­sumer prices to re­turn to pos­i­tive ter­ri­tory, nev­er­the­less, it would be pre­ma­ture to tighten now.”</p>
