    <p>Ever won­der what it is like to live in a fish tank?</p>
    <p>The mo­ment you roll up the blinds at Ocean Suites, you en­ter a hyp­notic blue uni­verse. Manta rays, ham­mer­head and ze­bra sharks, and shoals of groupers shimmy past your gi­ant 3m-by-3m win­dow, eye­balling you, cu­ri­ous as a fish.</p>
    <p>The only soak­ing you will get is in a sunken bath at the foot of the tow­er­ing win­dow, which looks out to the Open Ocean habi­tat of S.E.A. Aquar­ium. Bob­bing in a bub­ble bath while gaz­ing at the vast ocean floor is the money shot of the suites, which have long been a well-kept se­cret of Sen­tosa’s ul­tra­luxe trav­ellers, erst­while tourists from China and Ja­pan.</p>
    <p>But in this time of closed bor­ders, they are fill­ing up with a catch­ment of lo­cal fam­i­lies, an­niver­sary and hon­ey­moon cel­e­brants. Be­cause of scarcity, they are al­most al­ways fully booked.</p>
    <p>How Ocean Suites dif­fer­en­ti­ates it­self from other un­der­wa­ter ho­tels world­wide – of­ten built in the mid­dle of oceans – is you are guar­an­teed to see some 120 species of 40,000 marine crea­tures, dili­gently mak­ing their rounds in a show­piece tank mea­sur­ing 36m long and 8m tall, in one of the world’s largest aquar­i­ums.</p>
    <p>The rhyth­mic yet out of the blue flashes of fins keep me up most of the night. They are so mes­meris­ing, so lulling, that I re­sist draw­ing the cur­tains.</p>
    <p>By morn­ing, I am as wasted as the scythe-like Look­down fish, from all the slack-jawed star­ing. But how of­ten can you say the views were worth l os­ing sleep over?</p>
    <p>As for the big­ger ques­tion of whether the room is worth the eye-wa­ter­ing four-digit price, the short an­swer is: Do not ex­pect lux­ury.</p>
    <p>For fam­i­lies, the suite scores on de­tails like Le Petit Prince toi­letries for kids, pink and blue ju­nior slip­pers and mini bathrobes. But the decor is a some­what dis­cor­dant ritzy casino re­sort-meet­socea­narium-meets Bali.</p>
    <p>The du­plex is sep­a­rated by two long flights of stairs, clad in aqua­ma­rine car­pet­ing. There is a liv­ing room up­stairs, with a sofa which folds out to a rather un­yield­ing dou­ble bed. It looks out to a non­de­script out­door jacuzzi on the deck.</p>
    <p>Some un­char­i­ta­bly re­fer to the Ocean Suites as “themed carpark suites”, be­cause that is where they are sit­u­ated – un­der­ground. Oth­ers say the but­ler who comes with the suite is not so much a lux­ury as a ne­ces­sity, as is the fleet of bug­gies for guests, be­cause the ho­tel is lo­cated away from the main strip of Re­sorts World Sen­tosa.</p>
    <p>But if you have kids who love buggy rides, spi­ralling down a wind­ing carpark in the back­seat is as thrilling as a roller coaster. So for our fam­ily, the but­ler-driven buggy was a plus.</p>
    <p>The suites also opened our eyes to Re­sorts World Sen­tosa as an al­ter­nate uni­verse where big fish go to slake their wan­der­lust in style.</p>
    <p>Some ex­tras you can opt for with your suite in­clude VIP passes for at­trac­tions.</p>
    <p>For com­par­i­son, a Uni­ver­sal Stu­dios adult ticket costs about $66. The VIP ex­pe­ri­ence, with pri­or­ity ac­cess to all rides, a per­son­ally es­corted tour through the park and jump­ing to the head of the queue to take pic­tures with mas­cots: $318.</p>
    <p>A reg­u­lar S.E.A. Aquar­ium adult ticket costs $32. The VIP ex­pe­ri­ence, com­plete with a guide, ac­cess to back-of-house ar­eas, dol­phin pet­ting and learn­ing how jel­ly­fish and poi­son dart frogs are bred: $138.</p>
    <p>To top it off, splash out for din­ner at the one-Miche­lin-star ta­ble65, the in­te­grated re­sort’s an­swer to fun fine din­ing, which ends with a spec­ta­cle – a sor­bet apple core en­cased in a sugar bub­ble.</p>
    <p>Af­ter check­ing out of this wa­tery world, we landed back on the main­land with a thud, feel­ing like fish out of wa­ter.</p>
    <p>But it is for this sense of dis­lo­ca­tion, dis­cov­ery and de­light that we travel, both far and near.</p>
    <p>Still, be warned, af­ter this epic week­end of oceanic grandeur, ev­ery other may feel like a washout.</p>
    <p>Ditch the sofa bed on the du­plex up­per level. Pack a sleep­ing bag for kids to bed down “un­der­wa­ter” by the win­dow at the foot of the ocean floor. A night spent un­der the starry blue lights will be one to re­mem­ber.</p>
