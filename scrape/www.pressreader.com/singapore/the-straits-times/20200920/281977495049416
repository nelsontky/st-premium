    <p>WASH­ING­TON An Amer­i­can den­tist who ex­tracted a tooth from a se­dated pa­tient while bal­anc­ing on a hov­er­board has been sen­tenced to 12 years in jail for crimes in­clud­ing il­le­gal den­tistry, fraud and reck­less en­dan­ger­ment.</p>
    <p>Seth Lookhart, 35, sent phone footage to friends that showed him tak­ing out a pa­tient’s tooth while stand­ing on the two-wheeled hov­er­board be­fore rid­ing away as he stripped off his gloves and held his hands up in tri­umph.</p>
    <p>The Alaska State De­part­ment of Law cited An­chor­age Su­pe­rior</p>
    <p>Court Judge Michael Wolver­ton as stress­ing that the hov­er­board in­ci­dent was not the most se­ri­ous as­pect of the case.</p>
    <p>“Lookhart al­most killed many pa­tients by per­form­ing anaes­the­sia thou­sands of times with­out train­ing or con­sent, on pa­tients out­side his scope of train­ing and ex­per­tise, while steal­ing money from Med­i­caid and em­bez­zling from his bosses,” the state said in a state­ment.</p>
    <p>In a re­port pub­lished on Fri­day, CNN quoted Lookhart as say­ing: “Look­ing back, I can’t say ex­actly when I be­gan to go off course... I could have and should have main­tained bet­ter dis­ci­pline and fo­cus.”</p>
    <p>Pros­e­cu­tors also asked the court to or­der Lookhart to pay back more than US$2 mil­lion (S$2.7 mil­lion) em­bez­zled from state health funds.</p>
