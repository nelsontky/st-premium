    <p>Aries</p>
    <p>(March 21 - April 19)</p>
    <p>This is a great day for ex­er­cise, ther­apy or any­thing that can help you find re­lease – your emo­tional pres­sure is mak­ing life crazy for you.</p>
    <p>Taurus</p>
    <p>(April 20 - May 20)</p>
    <p>This is a bad time to hold back on speak­ing the truth. Your en­ergy is not up to main­tain­ing a ve­neer of de­ceit, so open up.</p>
    <p>Gemini</p>
    <p>(May 21 - June 20)</p>
    <p>Fire up the ig­ni­tion on a big project – things are sure to go your way if you use your ini­tia­tive. Some­one needs to see you can lead as well as fol­low.</p>
    <p>Can­cer</p>
    <p>(June 21 - July 22)</p>
    <p>Speak your piece – your col­leagues or friends need to hear where you re­ally stand. This could be tough, but the pay­off is sure to be worth it.</p>
    <p>Leo</p>
    <p>(July 23 - Aug 22)</p>
    <p>You are think­ing deeply about some­thing or some­one. Fig­ure out what you want and make long-term plans, but save ac­tion for to­mor­row.</p>
    <p>Virgo</p>
    <p>(Aug 23 - Sept 22)</p>
    <p>You feel more en­thu­si­as­tic for group projects and ac­tiv­i­ties than usual, which could mean that your col­leagues at work are in for a treat.</p>
    <p>Libra</p>
    <p>(Sept 23 - Oct 22)</p>
    <p>Though things may not be go­ing ac­cord­ing to plan, do what­ever it takes to avoid freak­ing out. The lit­tle de­tails of your life are still good.</p>
    <p>Scorpio</p>
    <p>(Oct 23 - Nov 21)</p>
    <p>You may not be one of those lucky few who can con­trol your dreams, but you can learn from them. Try to re­call what you can and use it.</p>
    <p>Sagittariu­s</p>
    <p>(Nov 22 - Dec 21)</p>
    <p>You take a philo­soph­i­cal bent as you me­an­der through the day, so you see things dif­fer­ently. That does not mean you can slack off, though.</p>
    <p>Capricorn</p>
    <p>(Dec 22 - Jan 19)</p>
    <p>You are filled with good so­cial en­ergy that needs a re­lease. If you can­not find a party, go danc­ing or find some other gath­er­ing.</p>
    <p>Aquarius</p>
    <p>(Jan 20 - Feb 18) Take care of house­keep­ing or do­mes­tic projects. Your en­ergy is bet­ter spent close to home, so find an ex­cuse and get busy.</p>
    <p>Pisces</p>
    <p>(Feb 19 - March 20)</p>
    <p>You need to show some­one what you are ca­pa­ble of, so demon­strate your tal­ents. You are coast­ing on great en­ergy, so it should be doable.</p>
