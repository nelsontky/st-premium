    <p>Dur­ing the ini­tial stages of the coro­n­avirus out­break in South Korea ear­lier this year, the Shin­cheonji Church of Je­sus at­tracted in­tense crit­i­cism af­ter re­ports emerged that its mem­bers were un­co­op­er­a­tive and ham­pered the health au­thor­i­ties’ ef­forts to trace and con­tain the virus.</p>
    <p>The church – which claims to have about 300,000 fol­low­ers around the world, in­clud­ing in Wuhan, China – was at the cen­tre of the ini­tial Covid-19 out­break in South Korea, which saw a sud­den out­break in Fe­bru­ary in con­nec­tion with a 61-year-old woman who was a mem­ber of the church and later la­belled a “su­per spreader” by South Korean health of­fi­cials.</p>
    <p>De­spite de­vel­op­ing symp­toms such as sore throat and fever, the woman twice re­fused to test for the coro­n­avirus and at­tended the church twice in Daegu with more than 1,000 con­gre­gants, where they wor­shipped in close prox­im­ity for hours.</p>
    <p>She also re­port­edly ar­gued with a health of­fi­cial for an hour be­fore agree­ing to take a coro­n­avirus test, and tested pos­i­tive on Feb 18.</p>
    <p>In­fec­tion fig­ures in Daegu, which has a pop­u­la­tion of about 2.5 mil­lion, later in­creased dra­mat­i­cally.</p>
    <p>By late Fe­bru­ary, the church ac­counted for at least 122 con­firmed cases of the virus in the coun­try, out of a to­tal of more than 200 – a six­fold in­crease from a week ear­lier when the woman was in­fected.</p>
    <p>Six months later, more than 5,000 church mem­bers were in­fected, mak­ing up 36 per cent of the to­tal Covid-19 cases in South Korea in Au­gust.</p>
    <p>The church’s founder Lee Man-hee, 88, was ar­rested that month for al­legedly with­hold­ing in­for­ma­tion about the church’s mem­bers and gath­er­ings from con­tact trac­ers.</p>
    <p>So far, South Korea has recorded nearly 28,000 Covid-19 cases and 487 deaths.</p>
    <p>More than 25,000 peo­ple have re­cov­ered so far.</p>
