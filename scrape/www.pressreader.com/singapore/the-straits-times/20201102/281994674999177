    <p>We thank Mr Phillip Tan Fong Lip for his views (Post­pone works at East Coast La­goon Food Vil­lage till next year, Oct 29).</p>
    <p>Pe­ri­odic re­fresh­ing of hawker cen­tres through re­pairs and re­dec­o­ra­tion helps to keep them in a good phys­i­cal con­di­tion, and en­sure a pleas­ant din­ing en­vi­ron­ment for pa­trons.</p>
    <p>This kind of works is car­ried out ev­ery six to eight years, and usu­ally lasts be­tween two and three months de­pend­ing on the scope of works. Also, the cost is borne by the Na­tional En­vi­ron­ment Agency (NEA).</p>
    <p>The last such up­grad­ing works for East Coast La­goon Food Vil­lage were in 2013.</p>
    <p>Rental re­mis­sion will be granted for the du­ra­tion of the works when the stallholde­rs are not op­er­at­ing their stalls, and NEA also of­fers tem­po­rary stalls to stallholde­rs who may wish to con­tinue their op­er­a­tions at other cen­tres dur­ing that pe­riod, sub­ject to stall avail­abil­ity.</p>
    <p>As stallholde­rs’ liveli­hoods may be af­fected, the pe­riod of clo­sure of a hawker cen­tre for such works is typ­i­cally de­ter­mined in con­sul­ta­tion with the stallholde­rs and hawk­ers’ as­so­ci­a­tion.</p>
    <p>The works at East Coast La­goon Food Vil­lage had orig­i­nally been planned to start be­fore this month, but were de­layed by the Covid-19 sit­u­a­tion.</p>
    <p>In July, close to 80 per cent of the stallholde­rs ex­pressed their pref­er­ence for the works to be­gin on Nov 2, so that they could be com­pleted be­fore Chi­nese New Year next year.</p>
    <p>NEA recog­nises that there may be some in­con­ve­nience caused to pa­trons and stallholde­rs dur­ing the pe­riod. Not­with­stand­ing, we do get strong sup­port from stallholde­rs for such works, as they gen­er­ally un­der­stand that ren­o­vated fa­cil­i­ties at­tract pa­trons and are good for their busi­ness. Pa­trons can also look for­ward to a more pleas­ant and hy­gienic din­ing en­vi­ron­ment af­ter the com­ple­tion of the re­pairs and re­dec­o­ra­tion works. An­drew Low</p>
