    <p>RE­DUC­ING IM­PACT</p>
    <p>There are ar­eas along the cor­ri­dor with denser veg­e­ta­tion, and if the trees there can be re­tained, the im­pact can be re­duced.</p>
    <p>DR HO HUA CHEW, vice-pres­i­dent of the Na­ture So­ci­ety (Sin­ga­pore). He says the viaduct closer to the west­ern catch­ment forests is of “great con­cern” as there is greater like­li­hood of wildlife cross­ing into Ten­gah from the veg­e­ta­tion there.</p>
    <p>Part of a for­est cor­ri­dor meant to pro­vide safe pas­sage for wildlife will be felled to make way for two viaducts that will con­nect the up­com­ing Ten­gah town with the Kranji Ex­press­way.</p>
    <p>The Land Trans­port Au­thor­ity (LTA) said the lost veg­e­ta­tion – which makes up about 3 per cent of the roughly 60ha for­est cor­ri­dor – will be re­planted.</p>
    <p>But ecol­o­gists say re­plant­ing trees is no sub­sti­tute for re­tain­ing trees, point­ing to how the orig­i­nal veg­e­ta­tion was decades of years old. Ma­ture trees pro­vide habi­tat “com­plex­ity”, a term bi­ol­o­gists use to de­scribe the range of ecosys­tem ser­vices that such trees pro­vide, from food to refuge for an­i­mals.</p>
    <p>More­over, viaducts run­ning through the cor­ri­dor will also cause dis­tur­bance to the an­i­mals us­ing it.</p>
    <p>The up­com­ing 700ha Ten­gah new town is the first new Hous­ing Board town since Pung­gol, and is touted as Sin­ga­pore’s first “for­est town”. It is be­ing built on sec­ondary forests that con­nect the veg­e­ta­tion in the west­ern catch­ment with the Cen­tral Catch­ment Na­ture Re­serve.</p>
    <p>To fa­cil­i­tate wildlife move­ment, the HDB had ear­lier said that a 100m-wide and 5km-long for­est cor­ri­dor “will be re­tained to pro­vide a habi­tat for plants and an­i­mals”. But news that two viaducts will be built through the for­est cor­ri­dor was raised dur­ing a vir­tual dis­cus­sion be­tween the na­ture groups and govern­ment agen­cies in June.</p>
    <p>The Straits Times un­der­stands that the con­struc­tion of the viaducts re­quires land clear­ance within the for­est cor­ri­dor to al­low for ve­hic­u­lar ac­cess, for ex­am­ple.</p>
    <p>A spokesman for LTA said it has en­gaged na­ture groups and will build suit­able tem­po­rary wildlife cross­ings be­fore the start of works to pro­vide safe pas­sage for an­i­mals dur­ing con­struc­tion.</p>
    <p>The Na­tional Parks Board (NParks) said it will share its ex­pe­ri­ence with LTA on the pro­posed tem­po­rary wildlife cross­ings.</p>
    <p>An NParks spokesman noted that most of the re­main­ing forests out­side the for­est cor­ri­dor will re­main un­de­vel­oped. “These ar­eas will serve as an in­terim forested refuge for fauna while the for­est cor­ri­dor un­der­goes habi­tat en­hance­ment. Larger tree saplings will be re­planted once LTA’s works have been com­pleted to help ac­cel­er­ate the process of the trees reach­ing the same ma­tu­rity lev­els as the rest of the cor­ri­dor,” she added.</p>
    <p>Dr Ho Hua Chew, vice-pres­i­dent of the Na­ture So­ci­ety (Sin­ga­pore), said the loss of ma­ture trees along the for­est cor­ri­dor was un­for­tu­nate, although the ex­tent of im­pact would de­pend on the ex­act lo­ca­tion the viaducts will be built.</p>
    <p>“There are ar­eas along the cor­ri­dor with denser veg­e­ta­tion, and if the trees there can be re­tained, the im­pact can be re­duced,” he said.</p>
    <p>For in­stance, Dr Ho said, the viaduct closer to the west­ern catch­ment forests is of “great con­cern” since there is greater like­li­hood of wildlife cross­ing into Ten­gah from the veg­e­ta­tion there. “Be­ing car­lite as a na­tional pol­icy should in­volve not just a re­duc­tion of cars but also a re­duc­tion of roads,” he said.</p>
    <p>Asked why the align­ment of the for­est cor­ri­dor was cho­sen even though viaducts were likely needed, HDB and NParks said it was planned af­ter tak­ing into ac­count var­i­ous fac­tors such as the ex­ist­ing to­pog­ra­phy and the longterm land use plans for Ten­gah.</p>
    <p>“The cur­rent align­ment of the cor­ri­dor will face the least amount of dis­rup­tion from trans­porta­tion and other ad­join­ing land uses such as com­mer­cial or res­i­den­tial use. In ad­di­tion, en­hance­ment plant­ing will be car­ried out to en­rich the for­est habi­tat in the long term,” they said.</p>
    <p>Last Mon­day, NParks an­nounced that two new na­ture parks – Bukit Ba­tok Hill­side Na­ture Park and Bukit Ba­tok Cen­tral Na­ture Park – will be de­vel­oped in the area as part of a na­ture cor­ri­dor con­nect­ing the Cen­tral Na­ture Park Net­work and the Ten­gah for­est cor­ri­dor.</p>
    <p>Wel­com­ing the news, Dr Ho said the two new parks, and the ear­lier an­nounced Bukit Gom­bak Park, will help re­duce gaps be­tween step­ping stones for wildlife cross­ing to the cen­tral na­ture re­serves.</p>
    <p>Help­ing wildlife cross from one for­est patch to the next will help them find food, meet and breed, and im­prove ge­netic di­ver­sity. This will also strengthen the re­silience of an­i­mal pop­u­la­tions to dis­eases or en­vi­ron­men­tal changes.</p>
    <p>In Oc­to­ber, The Straits Times re­ported that un­der sweep­ing changes made to the ex­ist­ing en­vi­ron­men­tal im­pact as­sess­ment (EIA) frame­work, plan­ners from de­vel­op­ment agen­cies will have to go through a course on ba­sic ecol­ogy and the EIA process.</p>
