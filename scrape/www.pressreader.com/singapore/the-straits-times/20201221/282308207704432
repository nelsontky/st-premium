    <p>Klaro, a bend­able and dis­pos­able light de­vice which can be used to il­lu­mi­nate cav­i­ties in open surgery, is now be­ing used in some hos­pi­tals here.</p>
    <p>The idea for such a de­vice first oc­curred to As­so­ciate Pro­fes­sor Tan Ngian Chye, a se­nior con­sul­tant at the Na­tional Can­cer Cen­tre Sin­ga­pore, some six years ago.</p>
    <p>Watch­ing his daugh­ter play with a rub­ber ball that lit up ev­ery time it hit the ground in­spired him to cre­ate a de­vice that could il­lu­mi­nate the body from within and come in use­ful in op­er­at­ing the­atres.</p>
    <p>Sur­gi­cal lights and head lamps cast shad­ows, caus­ing sur­geons some trou­ble, but with Klaro the is­sue dis­ap­pears. A pro­to­type was jointly de­vel­oped by lo­cal start-up Vivo Sur­gi­cal, Sin­ga­pore Gen­eral Hospi­tal’s Med­i­cal Tech­nol­ogy Of­fice, Na­tional Can­cer Cen­tre Sin­ga­pore and Pana­sonic Light­ing Europe in 2018.</p>
    <p>It was then fur­ther de­vel­oped and made ready for use by Vivo Sur­gi­cal, said the com­pany’s chief ex­ec­u­tive, Dr Kevin Koh.</p>
    <p>Klaro is equipped with a large clip that can be fas­tened to var­i­ous sur­faces, and has a row of small LEDs (light-emit­ting diodes) at its tip. The LEDs are cooler than reg­u­lar LEDs to avoid dam­ag­ing body tis­sue.</p>
    <p>Klaro will cost around $110 to $130 per piece, de­pend­ing on the quan­tity pur­chased. The de­vice can last for around four hours – suf­fi­cient for over 90 per cent of all open op­er­a­tions – be­fore it has to be dis­posed of af­ter use.</p>
    <p>Klaro was of­fi­cially launched at the Med­ica con­fer­ence in Ger­many in Novem­ber last year. Since then, over 1,100 sam­ple units have been sold to dis­trib­u­tors around the world.</p>
    <p>It has re­ceived ap­proval from the United States’ Food and Drug Ad­min­is­tra­tion as well as Europe’s CE mark cer­ti­fi­ca­tion. It also re­ceived ap­proval for sale in Sin­ga­pore from the Health Sciences Au­thor­ity in Jan­uary.</p>
    <p>“In Sin­ga­pore, sales have al­ready be­gun to SingHealth hos­pi­tals and clin­ics, where sev­eral de­part­ments have ap­proved Klaro for use in their op­er­at­ing the­atres,” said Dr Koh.</p>
    <p>The de­vice has proved to be par­tic­u­larly use­ful to clin­i­cians per­form­ing head and neck surgery, as they now have to don per­sonal pro­tec­tive equip­ment (PPE) for aerosol-gen­er­at­ing pro­ce­dures as part of Covid-19 pre­cau­tions.</p>
    <p>Dr Rahul Har­shad Na­ga­dia, a con­sul­tant from the Na­tional Den­tal Cen­tre Sin­ga­pore’s Depart­ment of Oral and Max­illo­fa­cial Surgery, said many oral op­er­a­tions and den­tal pro­ce­dures which re­quire the use of high-pres­sure drills or wa­ter sprays of­ten gen­er­ate aerosol in the process.</p>
    <p>How­ever, aerosol-pro­tec­tive PPE can be bulky, as it gen­er­ally in­cludes an N95 mask, eye gog­gles with straps that go round the head, and a head­lamp, which has straps that of­ten en­tan­gle with the eye gog­gle straps, said Dr Rahul. It is also some­times chal­leng­ing to po­si­tion and di­rect the head­light such that it il­lu­mi­nates the area for op­er­a­tion, he added.</p>
    <p>In con­trast, Klaro “is cheap, portable and dis­pos­able... and its flex­i­ble light cord, which can be placed close to the op­er­a­tive field, can al­low you to di­rect light to ar­eas that are not in a straight line”, he said.</p>
    <p>And while sur­geons have to clean the head­lamp thor­oughly af­ter each op­er­a­tion to avoid cross in­fec­tion, us­ing Klaro guar­an­tees that “a new ster­ile light is used for each pa­tient”.</p>
    <p>Clin­i­cal As­so­ciate Pro­fes­sor Goh Bee Tin, who is a se­nior con­sul­tant at the same depart­ment, said that wear­ing a head­lamp also cre­ates pres­sure around the head, which gives her a headache.</p>
    <p>Both sur­geons agreed that the de­vice could be use­ful for sur­geons deal­ing with the up­per aerodi­ges­tive tract – which in­cludes the nose, throat and mouth – as well as op­er­a­tions done in “deep and small cav­i­ties”.</p>
    <p>Cur­rently, Vivo Sur­gi­cal is work­ing with over 17 dis­trib­u­tors glob­ally to bring the prod­uct to its mar­kets, in­clud­ing coun­tries in South-east Asia.</p>
    <p>“Given the ver­sa­til­ity of Klaro as a sur­gi­cal light, it is fast be­com­ing a use­ful add-on to other sur­gi­cal de­vices in the mar­ket, even for spe­cialised chemo­ther­apy pro­ce­dures. We are pleased that Klaro’s util­ity is be­com­ing ap­par­ent to the med­i­cal fra­ter­nity,” said Dr Koh.</p>
