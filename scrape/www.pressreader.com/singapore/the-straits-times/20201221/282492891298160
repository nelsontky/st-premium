    <p>• No team is too good to go down as New­cas­tle, West Ham and Leeds can at­test.</p>
    <p>Ar­se­nal have only once been rel­e­gated be­fore – in 1912-13 – and boast the long­est streak in the English top flight but that is the fate await­ing them if they do not stop the rot.</p>
    <p>Gun­ners man­ager Mikel Arteta has ad­mit­ted his play­ers are in a “big fight” af­ter slip­ping to their eighth league de­feat of the sea­son at the hands of high-fly­ing Ever­ton on Satur­day.</p>
    <p>Carlo Ancelotti’s side pro­vi­sion­ally moved to sec­ond place, five points be­hind city ri­vals Liver­pool (31) af­ter beat­ing the vis­i­tors 2-1 in front of 2,000 fans at Good­i­son Park.</p>
    <p>At the other end of the ta­ble, the Gun­ners find them­selves just four points above 17th-placed Ful­ham (10), who are above Burn­ley – the Clarets have two games in hand – only on goal dif­fer­ence.</p>
    <p>Af­ter just one win in their past 10 league games, Arteta’s po­si­tion is un­der in­tense scru­tiny just four months fol­low­ing their 13th FA Cup tri­umph.</p>
    <p>Red cards un­did Ar­se­nal in their pre­vi­ous two games and much of the dam­age was again self-in­flicted, as Rob Hold­ing’s own goal opened the scor­ing for the Tof­fees. Ni­co­las Pepe’s penalty briefly lev­elled the scores, but Yerry Mina’s header af­ter Arteta’s side switched off on a cor­ner on the stroke of half-time se­cured a third con­sec­u­tive win for Ever­ton.</p>
    <p>To ex­ac­er­bate the sit­u­a­tion, cap­tain Pierre-Em­er­ick Aubameyang was ruled out be­fore the game with “a small strain” that is set to keep him out for one to two weeks.</p>
    <p>Ar­se­nal have made their worst start to a sea­son since 1974-75 but Arteta was still de­fi­ant as the sack ru­mours grow louder.</p>
    <p>“We re­acted re­ally well,” the Spa­niard said. “We dom­i­nated the game... We hit the bar. We don’t have the luck.</p>
    <p>“There is no ques­tion, the re­sults are not good enough and not ac­cept­able for the stan­dards of this club, and this is the chal­lenge and the fight that we are against.</p>
    <p>“It’s a re­ally com­pli­cated sit­u­a­tion, but I am very en­cour­aged from what I see from the play­ers to con­tinue do­ing what we are try­ing to do.”</p>
    <p>But pun­dits feel Arteta is in trou­ble as his play­ers do not have the stom­ach for a rel­e­ga­tion dog­fight.</p>
    <p>For­mer Eng­land cap­tain Alan Shearer told the BBC: “Aw­ful, no cre­ativ­ity, play­ers go­ing through the mo­tions, not work­ing hard enough and not clos­ing down.</p>
    <p>“Mikel Arteta should be a wor­ried man re­ly­ing on that group of play­ers try­ing to save his job, 12 goals all sea­son, they have no op­tions.”</p>
