    <p>WASH­ING­TON • As the sale of TikTok en­ters its fi­nal stages, Bei­jing is say­ing it wants the last word.</p>
    <p>In a bu­reau­cratic two-step, China late on Friday up­dated its ex­port con­trol rules to cover a va­ri­ety of tech­nolo­gies it deemed sen­si­tive, in­clud­ing tech­nol­ogy that sounded much like TikTok’s per­son­alised rec­om­men­da­tion en­gine.</p>
    <p>The changes mean Chi­nese In­ter­net gi­ant ByteDance will be re­quired to seek Chi­nese govern­ment ap­proval to sell the US oper­a­tions of its short-video app, ac­cord­ing to a per­son fa­mil­iar with the mat­ter.</p>
    <p>The new re­stric­tions cover tech­nolo­gies ByteDance uses in TikTok and will re­quire the com­pany to seek govern­ment ap­proval for any deal, ac­cord­ing to the per­son, ask­ing not to be iden­ti­fied be­cause the de­tails are not pub­lic. The new rule is aimed at de­lay­ing the sale and is not an out­right ban, the per­son said.</p>
    <p>On Saturday, the coun­try’s of­fi­cial Xin­hua news agency pub­lished com­men­tary by a pro­fes­sor who said the new rule would mean that the video app’s par­ent ByteDance might need a li­cence to sell its tech­nol­ogy to an Amer­i­can suitor.</p>
    <p>Bei­jing’s last-minute as­ser­tion of author­ity is an un­ex­pected wrin­kle for a deal as two groups race to buy TikTok’s United States oper­a­tions be­fore the Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion bans the app.</p>
    <p>Bei­jing’s moves en­snare TikTok and po­ten­tial Amer­i­can buy­ers in­clud­ing Mi­crosoft and Or­a­cle, wedg­ing them in the mid­dle of a tus­sle be­tween the US and China over the fu­ture of global tech­nol­ogy.</p>
    <p>Bei­jing’s dis­plea­sure alone could scare off TikTok’s suit­ors, many of whom have oper­a­tions in China.</p>
    <p>TikTok is the most glob­ally suc­cess­ful app ever pro­duced by a Chi­nese firm, and the con­flict over its fate could fur­ther frac­ture the In­ter­net and plunge the world’s two largest economies into a deeper stand-off. “At a min­i­mum, they’re flex­ing their mus­cles and say­ing, ‘we get a say in this and we’re not go­ing to be by­standers’,” said se­nior ad­viser Scott Kennedy at the Wash­ing­ton-based Cen­tre for Strate­gic and In­ter­na­tional Stud­ies, who stud­ies Chi­nese eco­nomic pol­icy.</p>
    <p>“It could be an ef­fort to out­right block the sale, or just raise the price, or at­tach con­di­tions to it to give China lev­er­age down the road,” he said, adding that it showed a rare bit of con­sen­sus be­tween China and the US that both agreed ByteDance was a na­tional se­cu­rity pri­or­ity.</p>
    <p>If Bei­jing blocks the sale of TikTok, it would ef­fec­tively be call­ing the Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion’s bluff, forc­ing the US govern­ment to go through with re­strict­ing the app and po­ten­tially in­cur­ring the wrath of its le­gions of in­flu­encers and fans.</p>
    <p>Or­der­ing firms like Ap­ple and Google to take down TikTok in app stores glob­ally could also prompt fur­ther anger against the Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion and even law­suits.</p>
    <p>China’s changes to its ex­port rules came just as ByteDance had sig­nalled that it was close to reach­ing a res­o­lu­tion on the fu­ture of TikTok’s busi­ness in the US. Pres­i­dent Donald Trump this month is­sued an ex­ec­u­tive or­der re­strict­ing Amer­i­cans’ deal­ings with TikTok from the mid­dle of next month.</p>
    <p>He and other White House of­fi­cials said the app could be a Tro­jan horse for data gath­er­ing by the Chi­nese Com­mu­nist Party, an ac­cu­sa­tion that ByteDance has de­nied. That set off the deal ne­go­ti­a­tions.</p>
    <p>Chi­nese of­fi­cials have de­nounced the US treat­ment of TikTok, char­ac­ter­is­ing it as “bul­ly­ing”.</p>
    <p>In Friday’s up­date to the ex­port con­trol rules, China’s Com­merce Min­istry and its Sci­ence and Tech­nol­ogy Min­istry re­stricted the ex­port of “tech­nol­ogy based on data anal­y­sis for per­son­alised in­for­ma­tion rec­om­men­da­tion ser­vices”.</p>
    <p>TikTok plays up its abil­ity to use tech­nol­ogy to un­der­stand users’ in­ter­ests and fill their feeds with more of what they will en­joy watch­ing.</p>
    <p>In the Xin­hua re­port, pro­fes­sor of in­ter­na­tional trade Cui Fan, from</p>
    <p>Bei­jing’s last-minute as­ser­tion of author­ity is an un­ex­pected wrin­kle for a deal as two groups race to buy TikTok’s United States oper­a­tions be­fore the Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion bans the app.</p>
    <p>China’s Univer­sity of In­ter­na­tional Busi­ness and Eco­nomics, said that ByteDance’s tech­nolo­gies would most likely be cov­ered by the new ex­port con­trols.</p>
    <p>“If ByteDance plans to ex­port rel­e­vant tech­nolo­gies, it should go through the li­cens­ing pro­ce­dures,” Xin­hua cited Prof Cui as say­ing.</p>
    <p>Any sale of TikTok would most likely re­quire the trans­fer over­seas of code and tech­ni­cal ser­vices.</p>
    <p>“It is rec­om­mended that ByteDance se­ri­ously study the ad­justed cat­a­logue, and care­fully con­sider whether it is nec­es­sary to sus­pend the sub­stan­tive ne­go­ti­a­tion of re­lated trans­ac­tions, per­form the le­gal dec­la­ra­tion pro­ce­dures and then take fur­ther actions as ap­pro­pri­ate,”</p>
    <p>Prof Cui was quoted as say­ing.</p>
    <p>Dr Kennedy said it was ex­ceed­ingly rare for a pro­fes­sor to make com­ments about a spe­cific, in­progress deal, and that it sig­nalled that ByteDance would now have to con­sult the Chi­nese au­thor­i­ties about the con­trols.</p>
    <p>China has pre­vi­ously used bu­reau­cratic pro­ce­dure to block com­mer­cial deals with­out ap­pear­ing to do so out­right.</p>
    <p>In 2018, Qual­comm called off a US$44 bil­lion (S$60 bil­lion) deal to buy Dutch chip­maker NXP Semi­con­duc­tors af­ter Chi­nese reg­u­la­tors sim­ply failed to ei­ther ap­prove or re­ject the trans­ac­tion.</p>
    <p>Bei­jing’s pro­longed anti-trust re­view was seen as a form of lev­er­age over trade talks with the Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion, though China’s Com­merce Min­istry de­nied that the two mat­ters were re­lated.</p>
    <p>The use of ex­port con­trols was novel, but it mir­rors sim­i­lar reg­u­la­tory hur­dles thrown at Chi­nese firms by the Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion.</p>
    <p>The White House or­der that prompted TikTok’s sale cited na­tional se­cu­rity con­cerns, and the US has re­peat­edly blocked Chi­nese bids for com­pa­nies with sen­si­tive tech­nolo­gies and data.</p>
