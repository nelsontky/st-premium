    <p>Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump, a master of dis­trac­tion, stuck with an out-of-con­trol pan­demic, at best a stut­ter­ing econ­omy, and bad job ap­proval rat­ings, on Thurs­day sug­gested the Nov 3 pres­i­den­tial elec­tion could be de­layed – some­thing which has never be­fore hap­pened in the his­tory of the US.</p>
    <p>The push­back was im­me­di­ate and came from across the board, in­clud­ing sev­eral staunch con­ser­va­tives. The Pres­i­dent later did not en­tirely back down, but tried to de­fend his logic by cit­ing re­ports cast­ing doubt on the in­tegrity of mail-in vot­ing – long a prac­tice in the United States.</p>
    <p>Sep­a­rately, at a Se­nate hear­ing the same morn­ing, when asked his opin­ion, Sec­re­tary of State Mike Pompeo raised even more red flags when he said: “In the end, the DOJ, oth­ers, will make that le­gal de­ter­mi­na­tion.”</p>
    <p>The DOJ is the De­part­ment of Jus­tice, headed by the At­tor­ney-Gen­eral – who is a pres­i­den­tial ap­pointee.</p>
    <p>The big ques­tion is whether Mr Trump has the power to de­lay the elec­tion. The short an­swer is, he does not. It is Con­gress that must de­cide.</p>
    <p>Nev­er­the­less, that he made the sug­ges­tion set the cat among Wash­ing­ton’s pi­geons.</p>
    <p>“De­lay­ing the elec­tion would be grotesque and un-Amer­i­can,” the right-wing Na­tional Re­view said in an editorial.</p>
    <p>In an ar­ti­cle in the New York Times, Trump sup­porter Steven G. Cal­abresi, a con­ser­va­tive stal­wart and co-founder of the Fed­er­al­ist So­ci­ety, and pro­fes­sor at North­west­ern Univer­sity’s Pritzker School of Law, said he was “ap­palled” – and warned of fas­cism.</p>
    <p>“Pres­i­dent Trump needs to be told by ev­ery Repub­li­can in Con­gress that he can­not post­pone the fed­eral elec­tion. Do­ing so would be il­le­gal, un­con­sti­tu­tional and with­out prece­dent in Amer­i­can his­tory. Any­one who says other­wise should never be elected to Con­gress again.”</p>
    <p>In a tweet, Dr Rachel Kle­in­feld, a se­nior fel­low in the democ­racy, con­flict and gov­er­nance pro­gramme at the Carnegie En­dow­ment for In­ter­na­tional Peace, said: “No, the Pres­i­dent can­not can­cel or post­pone the elec­tion.</p>
    <p>“But he can make it feel il­le­git­i­mate and get armed sup­port­ers to refuse to ac­cept it. Is that what he’s lead­ing to?”</p>
    <p>There is a grow­ing be­lief among an­a­lysts and for­eign diplo­mats that Pres­i­dent Trump is pre­par­ing the ground for dis­put­ing the re­sult if he loses.</p>
    <p>The Pres­i­dent has fu­elled this him­self – much as he has fu­elled con­tro­versy and out­rage be­fore; in 2016 he cast doubt for months that then Pres­i­dent Barack Obama was Amer­i­can-born (a pre­req­ui­site to be pres­i­dent), only to an­nounce with fan­fare that he had de­ter­mined he was.</p>
    <p>In March 2018, Mr Trump re­port­edly told a group of donors be­hind closed doors that he thought China’s Pres­i­dent Xi Jin­ping be­ing pres­i­dent for life was “great”.</p>
    <p>“Maybe we’ll want to give that a shot some day,” he said.</p>
    <p>The re­mark was in jest, but nev­er­the­less sparked worry; af­ter all, just over two years pre­vi­ously, count­less com­pla­cent po­lit­i­cal pun­dits had con­sid­ered his can­di­dacy a joke.</p>
    <p>Last month, the Pres­i­dent, asked di­rectly by Fox News host Chris Wal­lace whether he would ac­cept the elec­tion re­sult, replied: “I’m not go­ing to just say yes. I’m not go­ing to say no.”</p>
    <p>The stakes could not be higher on Nov 3, which will see a show­down be­tween two very dif­fer­ent ver­sions of Amer­ica – a lib­eral, glob­ally en­gaged one and an in­su­lar, na­tivist fortress. Do­mes­tic ten­sions are also run­ning high. A close elec­tion with a dis­puted re­sult will test Amer­ica’s in­sti­tu­tional re­silience.</p>
    <p>In June, the Tran­si­tion In­tegrity Pro­ject, a group of po­lit­i­cal op­er­a­tives, for­mer gov­ern­ment and mil­i­tary of­fi­cials, and aca­demics, in an on­line role-play­ing ex­er­cise ex­am­ined sev­eral sce­nar­ios that, as Nov 3 nears, do not seem far-fetched.</p>
    <p>“All of our sce­nar­ios ended in both street-level vi­o­lence and po­lit­i­cal im­passe,” Pro­fes­sor Rosa Brooks, a Ge­orge­town law pro­fes­sor and for­mer De­fence De­part­ment of­fi­cial who co-or­gan­ised the group, told the Bos­ton Globe.</p>
    <p>“The law is al­most help­less against a pres­i­dent who’s will­ing to ig­nore it.”</p>
    <p>His­to­rian Nils Gil­man, who leads re­search at a think-tank called the Berggruen In­sti­tute and helped or­gan­ise the ex­er­cise, told the Globe: “He (Pres­i­dent Trump) doesn’t have to win the elec­tion. He just has to cre­ate a plau­si­ble nar­ra­tive that he didn’t lose.”</p>
    <p>The stakes could not be higher on Nov 3, which will see a show­down be­tween two very dif­fer­ent ver­sions of Amer­ica – a lib­eral, glob­ally en­gaged one and an in­su­lar, na­tivist fortress. Do­mes­tic ten­sions are also run­ning high. A close elec­tion with a dis­puted re­sult will test Amer­ica’s in­sti­tu­tional re­silience.</p>
