    <p>PRAGUE • China’s global eco­nomic power makes the coun­try in some ways a more dif­fi­cult foe to counter than the Soviet Union dur­ing the Cold War, US Sec­re­tary of State Mike Pom­peo said dur­ing a visit to the Czech Repub­lic this week.</p>
    <p>He called on coun­tries in Europe to rally against the Chi­nese Com­mu­nist Party (CCP), which he said lever­ages its eco­nomic might to ex­ert its in­flu­ence around the world.</p>
    <p>“What is hap­pen­ing now isn’t Cold War 2.0,” he said in a speech to the Czech Se­nate on Wed­nes­day. “The chal­lenge of re­sist­ing the CCP threat is in some ways much more dif­fi­cult. The CCP is al­ready en­meshed in our economies, in our pol­i­tics, in our so­ci­eties, in ways the Soviet Union never was.”</p>
    <p>The Cold War ref­er­ence came after China’s am­bas­sador to London last month warned that the United States was pick­ing a fight with Bei­jing ahead of the US pres­i­den­tial elec­tion in Novem­ber.</p>
    <p>US-China ties have de­te­ri­o­rated quickly this year over a range of is­sues, in­clud­ing Bei­jing’s han­dling of the coro­n­avirus, telecom­mu­ni­ca­tions equip­ment maker Huawei, China’s ter­ri­to­rial claims in the South China Sea as well as the clam­p­down in Hong Kong.</p>
    <p>Mr Pom­peo’s visit to the Czech Repub­lic, a coun­try that was part of the Soviet bloc un­til the 1989 demo­cratic Vel­vet Rev­o­lu­tion, marked the first stop on a swing through the re­gion to dis­cuss cy­ber and en­ergy se­cu­rity.</p>
    <p>He used the oc­ca­sion to take a swipe at both Rus­sian and Chi­nese in­flu­ence, and lauded of­fi­cials in the cen­tral Euro­pean na­tion of 10.7 mil­lion who have taken on Bei­jing over the past year. He also cited the coun­try’s ef­forts to set se­cu­rity stan­dards for the de­vel­op­ment of 5G telecom­mu­ni­ca­tions net­works after a gov­ern­ment watch­dog warned about us­ing equip­ment made by China’s Huawei.</p>
    <p>Mr Pom­peo and Czech Prime Min­is­ter An­drej Babis signed a dec­la­ra­tion on 5G se­cu­rity in May, but the Czech Repub­lic has not made an out­right de­ci­sion to ban Huawei tech­nol­ogy. Czech Pres­i­dent Mi­los Ze­man has been pro­mot­ing closer ties with China.</p>
    <p>Mr Pom­peo also ac­knowl­edged the Czech Se­nate’s chair­man Mi­lan Vys­tr­cil, who fol­lowed through on a plan by his late pre­de­ces­sor to visit Tai­wan at the end of this month, a trip that has an­gered China.</p>
    <p>Mr Pom­peo said some coun­tries in Europe would take longer to wake up to the threats, but there was pos­i­tive mo­men­tum.</p>
    <p>“The tide has turned (in the US), just as I see it turned here in Europe as well. The West is win­ning, don’t let any­one tell you about the de­cline of the West,” he said.</p>
    <p>“It will take all of us... here in Prague, in Poland, in Por­tu­gal. We have the obli­ga­tion to speak clearly and plainly to our peo­ple, and with­out fear. We must con­front com­plex ques­tions... and we must do so to­gether.”</p>
