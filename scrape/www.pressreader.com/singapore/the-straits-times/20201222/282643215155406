    <p>For those who have lived through the wartime years, crops such as sweet potato and tapi­oca can still con­jure up mem­o­ries of scarcity and hunger.</p>
    <p>But now, th­ese tu­bers could play a small part in re­al­is­ing Sin­ga­pore’s food-se­cu­rity goals.</p>
    <p>That was what ur­ban farm­ing so­cial en­ter­prise Ed­i­ble Gar­den City wanted to high­light at its Wartime Food and Sus­tain­abil­ity work­shop, held in col­lab­o­ra­tion with Sen­tosa De­vel­op­ment Cor­po­ra­tion.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing the work­shop at Fort Siloso last month, par­tic­i­pants re­vis­ited the dark days of the Ja­panese Oc­cu­pa­tion at the Sur­ren­der Cham­bers and learnt how peo­ple adapted their food sources.</p>
    <p>It was not just a his­tory les­son. Guests were also brought back to the present as they found out crops such as sweet pota­toes and tapi­oca can grow eas­ily in Sin­ga­pore’s trop­i­cal cli­mate.</p>
    <p>They also got their hands dirty learn­ing to grow sweet potato leaves from cut­tings and tapi­oca tu­bers from stems.</p>
    <p>“We wanted to high­light th­ese plants as re­gion­ally na­tive ones that peo­ple can con­sider grow­ing and in­cor­po­rat­ing in their diet,” says Ms Sarah Ro­driguez, head of mar­ket­ing at Ed­i­ble Gar­den City.</p>
    <p>For in­stance, sweet pota­toes can be baked, mashed or served as fries, while their leaves make a tasty stir-fry. Tapi­oca, mean­while, can be sliced and made i nto cas­sava chips or baked. Their leaves can also be stir-fried.</p>
    <p>Ms Ro­driguez says for many peo­ple, con­sump­tion habits are shaped by West­ern recipes and im­ported pro­duce in su­per­mar­kets, such as kale.</p>
    <p>But eat­ing lo­cally grown pro­duce is fresher, more nutri­tious and has a lower car­bon foot­print, points out ur­ban farm­ing ed­u­ca­tor Eu­nice Ong. It also sup­ports Sin­ga­pore’s goal of pro­duc­ing 30 per cent of food lo­cally by 2030.</p>
    <p>The work­shop, at­tended mostly by fam­i­lies, was orig­i­nally slated for April, but had to be post­poned be­cause of the coro­n­avirus pan­demic. Twenty-eight peo­ple at­tended three ses­sions and or­gan­is­ers have plans for fu­ture col­lab­o­ra­tions.</p>
    <p>Ms Ong says: “Be­sides the con­nec­tion to sus­tain­able starches, we wanted to high­light how peo­ple can be cre­ative and re­source­ful in times of ad­ver­sity, and that the hu­man spirit can tri­umph over ob­sta­cles.”</p>
