    <p>•</p>
    <p>Myan­mar’s mil­i­tary has sought to un­der­mine the con­fes­sions of two sol­diers who said they were or­dered to “ex­ter­mi­nate” Ro­hingya Mus­lims be­fore tak­ing part in the mas­sacre of scores of men, women and chil­dren.</p>
    <p>Non-gov­ern­men­tal or­gan­i­sa­tion For­tify Rights and The New York Times on Tues­day re­leased de­tails of the filmed in­ter­views of Pri­vate Myo Win Tun, 33, and Pri­vate Zaw Naing Tun, 30, in which they de­scribed “wip­ing out” en­tire vil­lages.</p>
    <p>The sol­diers al­lege they were or­dered by se­nior com­man­ders to “shoot all that you see and hear” dur­ing the mil­i­tary op­er­a­tions in 2017 that forced some 750,000 Ro­hingya to flee to Bangladesh.</p>
    <p>Wide­spread atroc­i­ties have been doc­u­mented by United Na­tions in­ves­ti­ga­tors and rights groups that now see Myan­mar fac­ing charges of geno­cide, but this is the most de­tailed ac­count so far given by al­leged per­pe­tra­tors.</p>
    <p>The mil­i­tary’s spokesman, Bri­gadier-Gen­eral Zaw Min Tun, ad­mit­ted to BBC Burmese late on Wed­nes­day that the men were for­mer sol­diers, but claimed they had been “taken hostage” by the Arakan Army (AA) mil­i­tant group and “threat­ened and co­erced into con­fess­ing”.</p>
    <p>The AA is fight­ing the mil­i­tary in the coun­try’s north-west for more au­ton­omy for eth­nic Rakhine Bud­dhists. Both sides fre­quently trade ac­cu­sa­tions of hu­man rights abuses in a civil war rag­ing in the same area where the mil­i­tary op­er­a­tions against the Ro­hingya took place.</p>
    <p>The AA dis­missed the mil­i­tary’s claims, telling Agence Fran­ce­Presse yes­ter­day that the two sol­diers had de­serted.</p>
    <p>“They vol­un­tar­ily con­fessed about the war crimes com­mit­ted by Myan­mar’s mil­i­tary,” AA spokesman Khine Thu Kha said, adding that other de­fec­tors had given sim­i­lar tes­ti­monies, which they have posted on­line in re­cent months. For­tify Rights said it pub­lished its anal­y­sis of the con­fes­sions only af­ter be­ing cer­tain they were not made un­der duress.</p>
    <p>The NGO said the men ap­peared at the Bangladesh-Myan­mar bor­der ask­ing for pro­tec­tion, and have since been taken to The Hague, where the In­ter­na­tional Crim­i­nal Court (ICC) is in­ves­ti­gat­ing atroc­i­ties against the Ro­hingya.</p>
    <p>Work­ing in dif­fer­ent teams in sep­a­rate town­ships, the sol­diers con­fessed to killing up to 180 women, men and chil­dren be­tween them, bury­ing many of the bod­ies in mass graves. Myo Win Tun also ad­mit­ted to com­mit­ting rape.</p>
    <p>They gave the names and ranks of 17 other sol­diers they say com­mit­ted atroc­i­ties – in­clud­ing six se­nior com­man­ders who or­dered them to “ex­ter­mi­nate” all Ro­hingya. Myan­mar’s mil­i­tary has al­ways jus­ti­fied its 2017 op­er­a­tions as a means to root out Ro­hingya mil­i­tants af­ter at­tacks against se­cu­rity posts and po­lice sta­tions.</p>
    <p>In par­al­lel to the ICC in­ves­ti­ga­tion, Myan­mar also faces geno­cide charges at the UN’s top court, the In­ter­na­tional Court of Jus­tice.</p>
    <p>Civil­ian leader Aung San Suu Kyi led the coun­try’s de­fence team at pre­lim­i­nary hear­ings last De­cem­ber, con­ced­ing the army might have used “dis­pro­por­tion­ate” force, but deny­ing geno­cide.</p>
    <p>The AA has an “ob­vi­ous in­ter­est in mak­ing the Myan­mar mil­i­tary look bad”, said Yan­gon-based an­a­lyst Richard Horsey. “But that doesn’t mean the sol­diers them­selves can’t be cred­i­ble wit­nesses or sources of in­for­ma­tion.”</p>
    <p>The Euro­pean Par­lia­ment yes­ter­day re­moved Ms Suu Kyi from the “Sakharov Prize com­mu­nity” be­cause of her “ac­cep­tance” of state crimes against the Ro­hingya com­mu­nity. A source close to the Par­lia­ment said the prize had been awarded for her work be­fore 1990 and thus could not be with­drawn, but that this ex­clu­sion was the strong­est sanc­tion avail­able to Mem­bers of the Euro­pean Par­lia­ment.</p>
