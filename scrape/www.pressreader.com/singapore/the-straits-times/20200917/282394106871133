    <p>(France) Colom­bia’s Miguel An­gel Lopez won stage 17 of the Tour de France yes­ter­day to climb to third in the over­all stand­ings as race leader Pri­moz Roglic ex­tended his ad­van­tage.</p>
    <p>The race climbed to 2,304m al­ti­tude atop the Col de La Loze where Slove­nian rookie Tadej Po­gacar lost a hand­ful of sec­onds to his com­pa­triot Roglic in the race for the yel­low jersey on a day de­fend­ing cham­pion Egan Ber­nal with­drew.</p>
    <p>Richard Cara­paz pro­duced a doomed solo bid for Ineos as the Giro cham­pion was caught on the ever-chang­ing gra­di­ent of the fi­nal 7km above 2,000m as the top 10 ex­pe­ri­enced a slight shake-up.</p>
    <p>A day after the race was cleared of Covid-19 to run all the way to Paris on Sun­day, French Pres­i­dent Em­manuel Macron was present as the pelo­ton strug­gled through vil­lages full of ubiq­ui­tous bas­kets of flow­ers hang­ing from Swiss-style ski chalets.</p>
    <p>In the rar­efied air that suits the men from the An­des, Lopez leapfrogge­d com­pa­triot Rigob­erto Uran and ex­tended his lead over Adam Yates and Richie Porte.</p>
    <p>“I’m very emo­tional about it. We dreamed about it, we did it,” said the 26-year-old after be­com­ing the ninth rider on this year’s race to win his first Tour de France stage.</p>
    <p>Lopez, who jumped away from the lead­ing group 3.5km from the fin­ish, crossed the line 15sec ahead of Roglic and 30sec before Po­gacar.</p>
    <p>Roglic now leads his young com­pa­triot Po­gacar by 54sec with just three real races left before the Tour gets to Paris. Lopez is 1min 26sec off the pace, ahead of an­other gru­elling moun­tain stage to­day, over 175km be­tween Meri­bel and La Roche sur Foron.</p>
    <p>Ber­nal’s race ef­fec­tively ended on Sun­day as he fell eight min­utes be­hind the pace.</p>
    <p>The 23-year-old Colom­bian came into the Tour with a back in­jury and miss­ing key al­lies. Two of his team then suf­fered in­juries before Ber­nal him­self suf­fered a melt­down.</p>
    <p>“This is ob­vi­ously not how I wanted my Tour de France to end, but I agree that it is the right de­ci­sion for me in the cir­cum­stances,” he said in a state­ment from Ineos.</p>
