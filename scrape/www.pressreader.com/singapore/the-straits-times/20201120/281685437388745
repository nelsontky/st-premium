    <p>About 250,000 em­ploy­ees had their wages cut be­tween March and Septem­ber, ac­cord­ing to no­ti­fi­ca­tions re­ceived by the Min­istry of Man­power (MOM).</p>
    <p>This is about 7 per cent of the es­ti­mated 3.37 mil­lion-strong work­force here in Septem­ber, ex­clud­ing for­eign do­mes­tic workers.</p>
    <p>As at the end of Septem­ber, the min­istry had re­ceived close to 7,300 no­ti­fi­ca­tions on cost-cut­ting mea­sures from about 5,000 em­ploy­ers, said a re­port yesterday. Since March, em­ploy­ers with 10 or more em­ploy­ees have had to no­tify MOM if they take cost-sav­ing mea­sures that af­fect em­ploy­ees’ monthly salaries.</p>
    <p>The Tri­par­tite Al­liance for Fair and Pro­gres­sive Em­ploy­ment Prac­tices proac­tively en­gaged about 900 em­ploy­ers whose salary cuts af­fect­ing close to 52,000 em­ploy­ees ap­peared to be ex­ces­sive, and close to 330 of them agreed to re­view their mea­sures. The re­main­der were able to jus­tify the mea­sures taken as nec­es­sary for busi­ness sur­vival.</p>
    <p>MOM re­ceived about 580 com­plaints be­tween May and Au­gust re­lated to cost-sav­ing mea­sures taken by around 470 em­ploy­ers, said the re­port. The vast ma­jor­ity were able to re­solve their dis­putes am­i­ca­bly.</p>
    <p>For ex­am­ple, a stew­ard at a local ho­tel filed a com­plaint against her em­ployer as she felt she should be re­ceiv­ing at least 75 per cent of her salary as her em­ployer re­ceived fi­nan­cial sup­port, such as from the Jobs Sup­port Scheme. The em­ployer ex­plained to MOM that it was op­er­at­ing at a loss even with the fi­nan­cial sup­port from the Gov­ern­ment. The ho­tel’s man­age­ment ex­plained the sit­u­a­tion to its em­ploy­ees and sought their agree­ment on cost-sav­ing mea­sures.</p>
    <p>MOM as­sessed that the mea­sures were fair and rea­son­able to keep busi­ness op­er­a­tions sus­tain­able, and the com­plainant ac­cepted the ex­pla­na­tion and with­drew her com­plaint.</p>
    <p>MOM also re­ceived com­plaints in­volv­ing about 80 em­ploy­ers re­gard­ing the quan­tum of re­trench­ment ben­e­fits that they had given. It found over 60 per cent of them had pro­vided fair and rea­son­able re­trench­ment ben­e­fits. The oth­ers had gen­uine fi­nan­cial dif­fi­cul­ties.</p>
    <p>To date, no em­ployer has been found to wil­fully refuse to chan­nel gov­ern­ment sup­port to proper use, said the re­port.</p>
