    <p>Toh Wen Li</p>
    <p>WHO Mul­ti­dis­ci­plinary artist Riz­man Pu­tra, 42, has ap­peared in var­i­ous guises – from dress­ing as a life-size tis­sue pa­per packet for the Ur­ban Art Sin­ga­pore ex­hi­bi­tion in Paris last year, to star­ring in Teater Eka­ma­tra’s stage adap­ta­tion of A Clock­work Orange (2019). He is also an as­so­ciate artist at Cake The­atri­cal Pro­duc­tions and teaches drama at</p>
    <p>Chung Cheng High School (Main).</p>
    <p>On week­ends, I tend to rest, but also think about work for the com­ing week. I’m such a rest­less per­son, I need things to do.</p>
    <p>For the past few months, I’ve been re­hears­ing a play for the M1 Sin­ga­pore Fringe Fes­ti­val 2021. On Fri­days, I usu­ally go for re­hearsals at</p>
    <p>The Nec­es­sary Stage. Later in the day, I might work on my draw­ings at home.</p>
    <p>I usu­ally wake up early ev­ery day to ex­er­cise – around 6.30am. I’ve been do­ing In­san­ity Max, a high-in­ten­sity work­out. I bought the DVD and fol­low the rou­tine.</p>
    <p>I tend to chill a bit on Satur­days. Some­times I work out, some­times I don’t.</p>
    <p>If I don’t have re­hearsals in the af­ter­noon, I might go to Art Friend at Bras Basah Com­plex to buy art ma­te­ri­als such as pen­cils, ink and sketch­books.</p>
    <p>I also un­wind by watch­ing Net­flix. Re­cently,</p>
    <p>I saw Mar­riage Story (2019), which was pretty in­tense. Some­times, when I don’t have any­thing else on, I binge-watch shows for five to six hours with my part­ner. We’ve watched hor­ror se­ries</p>
    <p>The Haunt­ing Of Bly Manor (2020).</p>
    <p>For din­ner, I might get a chicken-rice take­away from the near­est cof­fee shop and surf the In­ter­net at home. This is what I’ve been do­ing since the start of the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>I used to hang out with friends a lot, but I haven’t seen them in a while. I’ve been iso­lat­ing my­self, do­ing my part to stop the spread of Covid-19.</p>
    <p>On Sun­days, I pre­pare lessons for my drama class at Chung Cheng High School (Main).</p>
    <p>I’m writ­ing a script for next year’s Sin­ga­pore Youth Fes­ti­val, which will fo­cus on body move­ment in­stead of voice.</p>
    <p>I’m also work­ing on two projects for</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore Art Week 2021. One is part of the Bus.Stop.Art. group ex­hi­bi­tion. The au­di­ence can scan QR codes at a bus stop and fol­low step-by-step in­struc­tions to draw some­thing.</p>
    <p>The other project is a video piece I spent three days shoot­ing last week.</p>
    <p>For din­ner, my par­ents and I some­times or­der seafood from a restau­rant and eat it to­gether.</p>
