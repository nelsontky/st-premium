    <p>A man who al­legedly slashed a Cer­tis en­force­ment of­fi­cer with a sickle ear­lier this week was charged yes­ter­day with one count of as­sault.</p>
    <p>Vik­neswaran Si­van, a 30-yearold Sin­ga­porean, is ac­cused of us­ing the weapon to slash Mr Mo­hamad Afiq Mo­hamad Jamil’s calves at Block 503C Can­berra Link near Sem­bawang Road at around 7.40pm on Mon­day.</p>
    <p>Cer­tis and the Na­tional En­vi­ron­ment Agency (NEA) had said in an ear­lier joint state­ment that Mr Afiq and an­other Cer­tis of­fi­cer were on en­force­ment duty against public health of­fences, such as lit­ter­ing and smok­ing, when the in­ci­dent oc­curred.</p>
    <p>Both of­fi­cers were at­tached to the NEA at the time.</p>
    <p>Af­ter an­other per­son was is­sued a fine for a smok­ing of­fence, Vik­neswaran al­legedly at­tacked Mr Afiq.</p>
    <p>The agen­cies said the at­tacker “was present but not im­pli­cated in the smok­ing en­force­ment ac­tion”.</p>
    <p>Some residents in the area told The New Pa­per that they heard screams dur­ing the in­ci­dent.</p>
    <p>A do­mes­tic helper was quoted as say­ing: “When I looked out, I saw a man ly­ing on the road in pain.</p>
    <p>“He looked like he had been hit by a car and was hold­ing his leg and scream­ing.”</p>
    <p>Vik­neswaran was ar­rested within seven hours of the in­ci­dent.</p>
    <p>His bail was set at $15,000 yes­ter­day and his case has been ad­journed to Dec 9.</p>
    <p>For vol­un­tar­ily caus­ing hurt with a weapon, an of­fender can be jailed for up to seven years and fined or caned.</p>
