    <p>A her­itage di­rec­tor who played a key role in hav­ing hawker cul­ture recog­nised by Unesco has be­come the first Sin­ga­porean to be elected to its eval­u­a­tion body.</p>
    <p>Mr Yeo Kirk Siang of the Na­tional Her­itage Board (NHB) will be on a 12-mem­ber in­ter­na­tional panel re­view­ing and rec­om­mend­ing nom­i­na­tions for in­tan­gi­ble cul­tural her­itage to the United Na­tions agency.</p>
    <p>He said it was vi­tal to pre­serve the cul­tural her­itage of cities, adding: “I think Sin­ga­pore can con­trib­ute with our mul­ti­cul­tural per­spec­tive and ur­ban ex­pe­ri­ence.</p>
    <p>“It’s im­por­tant to safe­guard the in­tan­gi­ble cul­tural her­itage in cities, es­pe­cially since more than half of the world’s pop­u­la­tion live in them. At the mo­ment, many of the cul­tural prac­tices on Unesco’s list con­tain ru­ral tra­di­tions.”</p>
    <p>As di­rec­tor of her­itage re­search and as­sess­ment at the NHB, Mr Yeo, 41, was in­stru­men­tal in the in­scrip­tion of Sin­ga­pore’s hawker cul­ture on Unesco’s in­tan­gi­ble cul­tural her­itage list last Wed­nes­day – a first for the coun­try.</p>
    <p>He will serve a term of four years on the 15th in­ter­gov­ern­men­tal com­mit­tee for the safe­guard­ing of in­tan­gi­ble cul­tural her­itage, start­ing on Jan 1, the NHB said yes­ter­day. The com­mit­tee in­cludes six ex­perts in fields of in­tan­gi­ble cul­tural her­itage from state par­ties and six rep­re­sen­ta­tives from non-gov­ern­men­tal or­gan­i­sa­tions ac­cred­ited by Unesco.</p>
    <p>Mr Yeo’s role in­volves re­view­ing and rec­om­mend­ing nom­i­na­tions for Unesco’s list of in­tan­gi­ble cul­tural her­itage in need of ur­gent safe­guard­ing, the rep­re­sen­ta­tive list of the in­tan­gi­ble cul­tural her­itage of hu­man­ity and the reg­is­ter of good safe­guard­ing prac­tices. He will also</p>
    <p>look at ap­pli­ca­tions by states for in­ter­na­tional as­sis­tance of more than US$100,000 (S$134,000).</p>
    <p>Mr Yeo never ex­pected to pur­sue his love for his­tory, which be­gan when he was a stu­dent at Vic­to­ria School. “I wasn’t sure about what I wanted to do so I de­cided to take the pop­u­lar route by study­ing for an engi­neer­ing de­gree at univer­sity,” he said. This changed when he found a job at the NHB, which mar­ried his de­sire to con­trib­ute to so­ci­ety with his pas­sion for his­tory.</p>
    <p>Since join­ing the statu­tory board in 2011, he has helped over­see the de­vel­op­ment of na­tional poli­cies and ini­tia­tives to safe­guard and pro­mote Sin­ga­pore’s in­tan­gi­ble cul­tural trea­sures, and to en­gage com­mu­ni­ties in the re­search and pro­mo­tion of the is­land’s her­itage.</p>
    <p>The hawker cul­ture nom­i­na­tion took al­most three years of work by the NHB, the Na­tional En­vi­ron­ment Agency and the Fed­er­a­tion of Mer­chants’ As­so­ci­a­tions. The list on which it now ap­pears com­prises more than 460 en­tries, in­clud­ing yoga in In­dia and Bel­gian beer.</p>
    <p>Mr Yeo said: “I am very honoured to be elected as a mem­ber of the Unesco In­tan­gi­ble Cul­tural Her­itage Eval­u­a­tion Body... The suc­cess­ful elec­tion is a pos­i­tive recog­ni­tion of Sin­ga­pore’s ef­forts in the safe­guard­ing of our in­tan­gi­ble cul­tural her­itage, and I look for­ward to con­tribut­ing to the work of the eval­u­a­tion body along­side cul­tural ex­perts from around the world.”</p>
