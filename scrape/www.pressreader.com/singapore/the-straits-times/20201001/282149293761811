    <p>Are there clear pro­to­cols for schools to abide by in cases of sex­ual abuse of young stu­dents?</p>
    <p>I was taken aback by the news about the for­mer pri­mary school teacher who sex­u­ally abused eight male pupils (Jail for ex-teacher who sex­u­ally abused eight boys, went on run for 17 years, Sept 28).</p>
    <p>Upon learn­ing of the or­deal of the pupils, it was re­ported that the school prin­ci­pal spoke to the per­pe­tra­tor two days later about the al­le­ga­tions and said he would alert the po­lice. Then he waited an­other day for the per­pe­tra­tor to re­turn to the school with his pass­port. In that time, the per­pe­tra­tor fled the coun­try.</p>
    <p>The eight pupils were tor­mented and suf­fered in si­lence be­fore fi­nally pluck­ing up the courage to re­port to the school au­thor­i­ties about what hap­pened.</p>
    <p>Al­though the man was ar­rested last year, af­ter 17 years on the run, where is the jus­tice for those young boys? They never got the jus­tice due to them as chil­dren. Those boys are adults now.</p>
    <p>At the stage of life where trust in author­ity is very high, this trust needs to be pro­tected and not taken ad­van­tage of.</p>
