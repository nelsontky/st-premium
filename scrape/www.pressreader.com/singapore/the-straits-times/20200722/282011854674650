    <p>Dr Alice Chua be­lieves that nurses are in the best po­si­tion to ef­fect trans­for­ma­tion in their pa­tients’ jour­ney to re­cov­ery, and re­search and con­tin­u­ing ed­u­ca­tion are needed to ad­dress pa­tients’ chang­ing needs.</p>
    <p>The nurs­ing prac­tice doc­tor­ate grad­u­ate is the as­sis­tant di­rec­tor of nurs­ing at the Na­tional Cancer Cen­tre Singapore and an ad­vanced prac­tice nurse, spe­cial­is­ing in on­col­ogy nurs­ing with a fo­cus on pa­tients with head and neck can­cers. Dr Chua, 44, is the nurse lead at the Al­lied Health Pro­fes­sional Clinic at the SingHealth Duke-NUS Head and Neck Cen­tre, which is a one-stop clinic that helps pa­tients in their post-op­er­a­tion re­cov­ery process.</p>
    <p>Be­sides en­sur­ing a high stan­dard of personalis­ed care for pa­tients, she goes the ex­tra mile to steer them to­wards re­cov­ery.</p>
    <p>When she re­alised that a num­ber of them faced speech dif­fi­cul­ties af­ter surgery, Dr Chua do­nated the money from her SingHealth GCEO Awards’ Out­stand­ing Nurse Award in 2017 to pur­chase portable elec­tronic writ­ing tools for their use. She also helped to source for ef­fec­tive and af­ford­able com­mu­ni­ca­tion aids for their long-term re­cov­ery.</p>
    <p>On a per­sonal trip to Tai­wan, she bought pneu­matic speak­ing valves that can help make speak­ing eas­ier for her pa­tients, which were later tested and ap­proved for use by the Health Sciences Au­thor­ity.</p>
    <p>Last year, the 24-year nurs­ing vet­eran ob­tained her doc­tor­ate in nurs­ing prac­tice from the School of Nurs­ing at Duke Univer­sity.</p>
    <p>As a mem­ber of the Na­tional Cancer Cen­tre Singapore’s nurs­ing re­search com­mit­tee, Dr Chua has also led six re­search stud­ies, fo­cus­ing on dif­fer­ent as­pects of op­ti­mis­ing the care given to pa­tients and short­en­ing their length of hos­pi­tal­i­sa­tion.</p>
    <p>“I think it’s im­por­tant to stay on top of cur­rent trends and prac­tices through con­tin­ued re­search and ed­u­ca­tion, es­pe­cially so with a con­stantly chang­ing health­care land­scape,” said Dr Chua.</p>
    <p>“That way, we will then be able to value-add to our pa­tients and guide them safely along their re­cov­ery jour­ney,” she added.</p>
