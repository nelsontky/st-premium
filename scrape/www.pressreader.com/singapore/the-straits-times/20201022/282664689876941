    <p>Aries (March 21 - April 19)</p>
    <p>Keep your feet on the ground. Your en­ergy feels flat and dif­fused, but that could help you to keep your agenda fairly low-key.</p>
    <p>Tau­rus (April 20 - May 20)</p>
    <p>Your con­fi­dence al­lows you to con­vince peo­ple with­out hav­ing to try too hard. You make a valu­able new con­nec­tion as a re­sult.</p>
    <p>Gem­ini (May 21 - June 20)</p>
    <p>A sim­ple task turns out to be dif­fi­cult, but you can­not walk away. Seek as­sis­tance or at least a fresh per­spec­tive on the prob­lem.</p>
    <p>Cancer (June 21 - July 22) A work in­ci­dent es­ca­lates into some­thing big­ger than you had an­tic­i­pated. It is not that hard to solve it, but it does take time.</p>
    <p>Leo (July 23 - Aug 22)</p>
    <p>Do what­ever it takes to move be­yond petty con­cerns. You can suc­ceed if you find a way to ap­proach the prob­lem with a clear mind.</p>
    <p>Virgo (Aug 23 - Sept 22)</p>
    <p>A tiny prob­lem hin­ders you from un­leash­ing your creativ­ity. Once that is solved, you can fo­cus on the im­por­tant mat­ters at hand.</p>
    <p>Li­bra (Sept 23 - Oct 22)</p>
    <p>A su­per­vi­sor has con­cerns that may set you back, but do not fight it. If you are be­tween jobs, you may lose some ground, but it is tem­po­rary.</p>
    <p>Scor­pio (Oct 23 - Nov 21)</p>
    <p>Try not to get too caught up in how things ought to be – you can tell when things are work­ing well. Get your friends to back you up.</p>
    <p>Sagit­tar­ius (Nov 22 - Dec 21)</p>
    <p>Save money on food and other es­sen­tials. Try not to eat out, make sure you are not wast­ing re­sources and re­main as fru­gal as pos­si­ble.</p>
    <p>Capri­corn (Dec 22 - Jan 19)</p>
    <p>It is a good time for you to push your­self. Re­sults from a test or project en­cour­age you. Keep go­ing and you could re­ally go places.</p>
    <p>Aquar­ius (Jan 20 - Feb 18)</p>
    <p>Do not let your­self be­come a tar­get at work. It is one of those days when it is best to keep your head down and hope to quit soon.</p>
    <p>Pisces (Feb 19 - March 20)</p>
    <p>Your col­leagues need you as much as you need them. It may be a good time to con­nect with some­one who can help you get the job you want.</p>
