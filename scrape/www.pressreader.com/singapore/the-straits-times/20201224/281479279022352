    <p>About 70 per cent of Sin­ga­pore res­i­dents are now us­ing the TraceTo­gether app or to­kens, ful­fill­ing a tar­get that the au­thor­i­ties wanted to meet be­fore the coun­try en­tered phase three of its re­open­ing.</p>
    <p>But TraceTo­gether SafeEn­try will not be made manda­tory un­til ev­ery­one has had the chance to col­lect the to­ken or down­load the app, Min­is­ter-in-Charge of the Smart Na­tion Ini­tia­tive Vi­vian Balakrishn­an said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Dr Balakrishn­an, who is also For­eign Min­is­ter, said that as at Mon­day, there was 70 per cent par­tic­i­pa­tion in the na­tional con­tact trac­ing pro­gramme, with more than 3.8 mil­lion users.</p>
    <p>“There’s been more than two mil­lion peo­ple who have down­loaded the app and have reg­is­tered and are us­ing it,” he told re­porters on the side­lines of a to­ken dis­tri­bu­tion ex­er­cise at Kam­pong Kem­ban­gan Com­mu­nity Club in Eunos.</p>
    <p>“In ad­di­tion, since Sept 14, when we started the dis­tri­bu­tion of the TraceTo­gether to­kens, we have dis­trib­uted so far about 1.75 mil­lion to­kens,” he added.</p>
    <p>Apart from the 70 per cent TraceTo­gether tar­get, Sin­ga­pore also wanted safe man­age­ment com­pli­ance and suf­fi­cient test­ing ca­pa­bil­i­ties be­fore en­ter­ing phase three of re­open­ing its econ­omy.</p>
    <p>Phase three will kick in next Mon­day when, among other things, ca­pac­ity lim­its in pub­lic places like malls, at­trac­tions and places of wor­ship will be eased.</p>
    <p>SafeEn­try is now man­dated at all these places, but when ev­ery­one has had the chance to ob­tain the TraceTo­gether to­ken or down­load the app by early next year, these must be used in­stead. The app in­cludes a func­tion to scan SafeEn­try QR codes, while the to­kens sport a QR code with a sim­i­lar func­tion.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, Dr Balakrishn­an also said schools will be dis­tribut­ing the to­kens to stu­dents so they will be able to par­tic­i­pate in con­tact trac­ing, and to avoid a rush for the to­kens. In a re­lease yes­ter­day, the Smart Na­tion and Dig­i­tal Gov­ern­ment Group said more de­tails on this will be shared later, and stu­dents do not need to have to­kens when school re­opens next year.</p>
    <p>“We will also be dis­tribut­ing to­kens through the schools... Those of you with chil­dren or stu­dents, don’t worry. You don’t need to rush down to the com­mu­nity clubs. You can also col­lect a to­ken in school in due time,” said Dr Balakrishn­an.</p>
    <p>The free to­kens have been dis­trib­uted to the pub­lic since Septem­ber in com­mu­nity cen­tres/clubs (CCs). Since late Oc­to­ber, they have been dis­trib­uted one con­stituency at a time to pre­vent long queues from form­ing. To­ken col­lec­tion be­gan at the six re­main­ing CCs yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Dr Balakrishn­an said that the Gov­ern­ment has in­creased its or­der for the to­kens, and that by the end of Fe­bru­ary, it would have given out up to five mil­lion to­kens.</p>
    <p>“Over the next few weeks and months, as the ad­di­tional stocks of to­kens come in, we will re­open the CCs which cur­rently are not dis­tribut­ing to­kens. So I want to em­pha­sise that there is no need to rush,” he added.</p>
    <p>The TraceTo­gether app and to­ken work by ex­chang­ing Bluetooth sig­nals with other TraceTo­gether apps or to­kens nearby. This prox­im­ity data, which is en­crypted and stored for 25 days be­fore be­ing au­to­mat­i­cally deleted, al­lows for quick con­tact trac­ing.</p>
    <p>Dr Balakrishn­an said that while there may be four dif­fer­ent de­signs of the to­kens that are be­ing dis­trib­uted, they all work the same way.</p>
    <p>The de­signs may have changed, but he stressed that the only dif­fer­ence is in the look, and not the func­tion of the de­vice.</p>
    <p>The free TraceTo­gether to­kens are be­ing dis­trib­uted na­tion­wide, in a bid to make con­tact trac­ing even more ef­fi­cient. Here is what you need to know.</p>
