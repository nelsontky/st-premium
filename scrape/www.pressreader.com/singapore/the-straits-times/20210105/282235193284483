    <p>A six-year-old boy was res­cued from the third-floor ledge of a hous­ing block in Hougang on Sun­day morn­ing by a worker us­ing a boom lift.</p>
    <p>The Sin­ga­pore Civil De­fence Force (SCDF) said yes­ter­day that it had re­ceived a call for as­sis­tance at Block 243 Hougang Street 22 at about 7.50am on Sun­day.</p>
    <p>Its spokesman added that the child was res­cued by a worker in a boom lift be­fore SCDF of­fi­cers ar­rived at the scene.</p>
    <p>The boy, who was as­sessed by an SCDF para­medic, was not taken to the hos­pi­tal.</p>
    <p>In a video shared on What­sApp and up­loaded to Face­book, the child, dressed in an orange T-shirt and long pants, is seen stand­ing on the ledge and hold­ing onto a laun­dry rack.</p>
    <p>Voices out of frame are heard re­mind­ing the child to hold on to the rack at one point when he loosens his grip. The child obeys the in­struc­tions.</p>
    <p>A worker wear­ing a blue hel­met is si­mul­ta­ne­ously seen stand­ing on the boom lift’s plat­form as he op­er­ates it, ma­noeu­vring the plat­form so that he is brought within reach of the stranded boy.</p>
    <p>When he gets close to the child, the worker reaches out with both arms and lifts the boy into the plat­form – an act met with cheers from those out­side the frame.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, Chi­nese evening daily Lianhe Wanbao re­ported that the six-year-old boy climbed out of a kitchen win­dow af­ter wak­ing up to dis­cover that he was home alone.</p>
    <p>It added that the boy was cry­ing on the ledge as he looked for his mother, and that neigh­bours who knocked on the door af­ter spot­ting the child did not get a re­sponse.</p>
    <p>Work­ers in­ter­viewed at the scene by Lianhe Wanbao yes­ter­day said two work­ers who usu­ally prune trees were in­volved in res­cu­ing the boy on Sun­day, and that even though they were not at the foot of the block when the boy climbed out of the win­dow, they were drawn to the scene by his cries.</p>
