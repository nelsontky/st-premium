    <p>This month, the Sin­ga­pore Flyer trans­forms into a por­tal to the moon, where a pi­ano-play­ing as­tro­naut guides the au­di­ence through lu­nar land­scapes with bird-headed dancers – vir­tu­ally, that is.</p>
    <p>The Arts Fission Com­pany typ­i­cally marks the Mid-Au­tumn Fes­ti­val with Moon­struck, a site-spe­cific se­ries dat­ing back to 2009.</p>
    <p>It has been staged atop an open trailer and per­formed in parks. But this year, the pan­demic has thrust it into the nowhere of dig­i­tal space.</p>
    <p>Straw­berry Moon In Four Acts is filmed in 360 de­grees with aug­mented re­al­ity (AR). It is the first lo­cal pro­duc­tion to make use of The Future Stage, an im­mer­sive plat­form un­veiled in Au­gust that aims to re­pro­duce the the­atri­cal ex­pe­ri­ence dig­i­tally.</p>
    <p>Arts Fission artis­tic di­rec­tor An­gela Liong, 69, makes no bones about the dif­fi­cul­ties of the new medium.</p>
    <p>“Hon­estly, I’m not to­tally at peace with this project,” says the Cul­tural Medal­lion re­cip­i­ent.</p>
    <p>“We fin­ish shoot­ing, we hand it over and we can only wait and see what the end re­sult will be like. But what­ever it is, I think that now every­body in the com­mu­nity needs to look at dig­i­tal­i­sa­tion, like it or not.”</p>
    <p>Straw­berry Moon – which takes its name from the last full moon in June, dur­ing sum­mer straw­berry sea­son – is a mod­u­lar rather than lin­ear nar­ra­tive.</p>
    <p>View­ers fol­low an as­tro­naut – pi­anist Shane Thio, who plays pieces such as Gabriel Faure’s Clair de Lune and Fran­cis Poulenc’s Me­lan­colie – into a Sin­ga­pore Flyer cap­sule.</p>
    <p>They can then choose to en­ter four dif­fer­ent lu­narscapes in any or­der, from the wa­tery Chang-E’s Mir­ror to the arid ge­og­ra­phy of Pa­vane On Moon­dust.</p>
    <p>In Rab­bit Dream­ing, per­cus­sion­ist Cheong Kah Yiong ap­pears as the Jade Rab­bit, play­ing the yun­luo, a traditiona­l in­stru­ment of tiny brass gongs mounted on a rack, while in Lu­nar Wind Chasers, the dancers don bird masks.</p>
    <p>As one can­not ac­tu­ally dance in the Sin­ga­pore Flyer due to safety rea­sons, the dance se­quences were shot sep­a­rately in a stu­dio.</p>
    <p>The moon has long been a realm of es­cape in many cul­tures, says Liong, and that flight of whimsy has be­come es­pe­cially vi­tal now.</p>
    <p>“The hu­man ca­pac­ity to imag­ine is such a pow­er­ful tool. Deal­ing with real facts is one thing, but it is im­por­tant to re­mind our­selves that it is this abil­ity to imag­ine that will lift us amid all these chal­lenges and en­able us to go on.”</p>
