    <p>BEI­JING • Just in time for its Na­tional Day in Oc­to­ber, China com­pleted con­struc­tion of a new vil­lage high in the moun­tains where the Chi­nese re­gion of Ti­bet meets the king­dom of Bhutan.</p>
    <p>A hun­dred peo­ple moved into two dozen new homes be­side the Torsa River and cel­e­brated the hol­i­day by rais­ing China’s flag and sing­ing the na­tional an­them.</p>
    <p>“Each of us is a co­or­di­nate of the great moth­er­land,” a bor­der guard was quoted as say­ing by state news agency, China Ti­betan News.</p>
    <p>The prob­lem is, th­ese new “co­or­di­nates” are more than 1.6km in­side what Bhutan con­sid­ers to be its ter­ri­tory.</p>
    <p>The con­struc­tion, doc­u­mented in satel­lite pho­tos, fol­lowed a play­book that China has used for years. It has brushed aside neigh­bours’ claims of sovereignt­y to ce­ment its po­si­tion in ter­ri­to­rial dis­putes by uni­lat­er­ally chang­ing the facts on the ground.</p>
    <p>It used sim­i­lar tac­tics in the South China Sea, where it for­ti­fied and armed shoals claimed by Viet­nam and the Philip­pines, de­spite promis­ing the United States not to do so.</p>
    <p>This year, China’s mil­i­tary built up forces in the Hi­malayas and crossed into ter­ri­tory that In­dia claimed was on its side of the two coun­tries’ de facto bor­der.</p>
    <p>That l ed to China’s blood­i­est clash in decades, leav­ing at least 21 In­dian sol­diers dead, along with an un­known num­ber of Chi­nese troops.</p>
    <p>The vi­o­lence badly soured bi­lat­eral re­la­tions that had been steadily im­prov­ing.</p>
    <p>Even when chal­lenged, China’s ter­ri­to­rial grabs are dif­fi­cult to re­verse, short of the use of force, as the In­dian govern­ment has learnt. Since the dis­pute at the bor­der, Chi­nese troops have re­mained camped in ar­eas that In­dia once con­trolled.</p>
    <p>“In the end, it re­flects the con­sol­i­da­tion of China’s con­trol over the area it claims,” said an ex­pert on China’s mil­i­tary, As­so­ciate Pro­fes­sor M. Tay­lor Fravel.</p>
    <p>Over the past year, China has moved against many of its neigh­bours, seem­ingly with lit­tle re­gard for the pos­si­ble fall­out. Pres­i­dent Xi Jin­ping of­ten cites China’s his­tor­i­cal griev­ances against for­eign en­croach­ment and coloni­sa­tion, us­ing its past to jus­tify its strate­gic ac­tiv­i­ties.</p>
    <p>The con­struc­tion of the Hi­malayan vil­lage sug­gests that China has ex­tended a broader cam­paign to for­tify its south­ern flanks to in­clude Bhutan, a na­tion of 800,000 peo­ple.</p>
    <p>As the con­struc­tion was un­der way on that long-dis­puted bor­der, China added a new claim this sum­mer to nearly 780 sq km of ter­ri­tory in the Sak­teng Wildlife Sanc­tu­ary, an area on the other side of Bhutan from where the vil­lage was be­ing built.</p>
    <p>In push­ing its bound­aries, China ap­pears to have brushed aside decades of quiet and ul­ti­mately fruit­less talks to fi­nalise the two coun­tries’ bor­der. A 25th round of talks this year was post­poned be­cause of the coro­n­avirus.</p>
    <p>“The Chi­nese ob­vi­ously seem to be los­ing pa­tience,” Mr Ten­z­ing Lam­sang, edi­tor of the news­pa­per The Bhutanese and pres­i­dent of the Me­dia As­so­ci­a­tion of Bhutan, wrote on Twit­ter.</p>
    <p>The dis­pute stems from dif­fer­ent in­ter­pre­ta­tions of a treaty signed in 1890 by two now-de­funct im­pe­rial pow­ers, Bri­tain as In­dia’s colo­nial ruler and the Qing dy­nasty.</p>
    <p>The new vil­lage is near the Dok­lam plateau, where the bor­ders of China, In­dia and Bhutan con­verge.</p>
    <p>The plateau was the site of a 73-day stand-off be­tween In­dian and Chi­nese troops in 2017 that be­gan over the con­struc­tion of a road into Bhutanese ter­ri­tory. In­dia, which is obliged to de­fend Bhutan un­der a long­stand­ing se­cu­rity pact, sent troops to halt the Chi­nese work.</p>
    <p>Bhutan, which in re­cent years has felt squeezed be­tween the two gi­ants, poses no mil­i­tary threat to China.</p>
    <p>For China, con­trol of the area would give its forces a strate­gic po­si­tion near a nar­row strip of land in In­dia, the Silig­uri Cor­ri­dor.</p>
    <p>That area, which In­dian mil­i­tary strate­gists call the Chicken Neck, con­nects the bulk of In­dia to its eastern-most prov­inces bor­der­ing Bangladesh, Myan­mar and China.</p>
    <p>Mr Lam­sang noted that Bhutan has long had to de­fer to In­dia’s se­cu­rity in­ter­ests.</p>
    <p>In its re­peated talks with the Chi­nese, Bhutan has so far been un­will­ing to make any ter­ri­to­rial con­ces­sions along the western and cen­tral bor­ders.</p>
    <p>Nei­ther the Bhutanese nor the Chi­nese for­eign min­istry re­sponded to re­quests for com­ment.</p>
    <p>The Global Times, a Com­mu­nist Party news­pa­per, ridiculed the claims that the newly built vil­lage was in Bhutan, blam­ing In­dia for stok­ing ten­sions with China’s south­ern neigh­bours.</p>
    <p>It later warned against “loom­ing for­eign forces back­ing the Chin­abash­ing cam­paign across the Hi­malayas”.</p>
    <p>The ex­act lo­ca­tion of the new vil­lage, called Pangda, emerged in a se­ries of satel­lite im­ages pub­lished re­cently by US-based Maxar Tech­nolo­gies.</p>
    <p>The im­ages showed that con­struc­tion be­gan late last year and was com­pleted, it seems, not long be­fore Oct 1 – China’s Na­tional Day.</p>
    <p>China’s ver­sion of the bor­der lies south of the vil­lage.</p>
    <p>The im­ages also showed ex­ten­sive new road-build­ing and the con­struc­tion of what seem to be mil­i­tary stor­age bunkers, said Maxar spokesman Stephen Wood.</p>
    <p>The bunkers are in undis­puted Chi­nese ter­ri­tory, though, in­di­cat­ing that China has sought to build up its mil­i­tary pres­ence along much of the Hi­malayan bor­der area.</p>
    <p>The new vil­lage is near the Dok­lam plateau, where the bor­ders of China, In­dia and Bhutan con­verge. The plateau was the site of a 73-day stand-off be­tween In­dian and Chi­nese troops in 2017 that be­gan over the con­struc­tion of a road into Bhutanese ter­ri­tory. In­dia, which is obliged to de­fend Bhutan un­der a long­stand­ing se­cu­rity pact, sent troops to halt the Chi­nese work.</p>
