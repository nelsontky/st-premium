    <p>The Malaysian bud­get for next year was rat­i­fied by Par­lia­ment yes­ter­day. The fol­low­ing are among the changes ap­proved in Bud­get 2021.</p>
    <p>• Au­to­matic loan re­lief ap­proval for B40 com­mu­ni­ties and small busi­nesses</p>
    <p>The op­po­si­tion and sev­eral govern­ment MPs had threat­ened not to back the bud­get, which was un­veiled on Nov 6, if a loan mora­to­rium scheme – first im­ple­mented from April un­til Septem­ber – was not ex­tended.</p>
    <p>Fi­nance Min­is­ter Tengku Zafrul Aziz later said banks have been told to grant au­to­matic mora­to­rium ap­provals for tar­geted com­mu­ni­ties, es­pe­cially for the B40 (bot­tom 40 per cent of Malaysian in­come earn­ers) and small busi­nesses.</p>
    <p>• Broader re­tire­ment fund with­drawal</p>
    <p>Fol­low­ing de­mands by sev­eral Umno law­mak­ers, the bud­get will pro­vide a broader with­drawal scope for those want­ing to tap their re­tire­ment funds in the Em­ploy­ees Prov­i­dent Fund to ease cur­rent fi­nan­cial dif­fi­cul­ties.</p>
    <p>The govern­ment pre­vi­ously made with­drawals avail­able for up to two mil­lion ac­count hold­ers, al­low­ing them to with­draw RM6,000 (S$1,970) a year.</p>
    <p>The govern­ment has raised the el­i­gi­bil­ity to eight mil­lion ac­count hold­ers, for a with­drawal amount of up to RM10,000.</p>
    <p>• Bud­get cut for pro­pa­ganda unit</p>
    <p>Much at­ten­tion was given to a plan to res­ur­rect the Spe­cial Af­fairs De­part­ment (Jasa), a govern­ment pro­pa­ganda unit, with an an­nual al­lo­ca­tion of RM85 mil­lion.</p>
    <p>The move to re­launch Jasa, since re­named Com­mu­nity Com­mu­ni­ca­tions De­part­ment or J-Kom, was widely panned by both govern­ment and op­po­si­tion MPs.</p>
    <p>The de­part­ment will still be re­launched, with its al­lo­ca­tion cut to RM40 mil­lion.</p>
    <p>• Broader aid to front-lin­ers</p>
    <p>The govern­ment ini­tially an­nounced a one-off RM500 aid to all health front-lin­ers, but later ex­panded the spe­cial aid to all front-lin­ers, in­clud­ing mil­i­tary and po­lice per­son­nel.</p>
    <p>• Ex­tra al­lo­ca­tion for Sabah</p>
    <p>An ex­tra RM50 mil­lion al­lo­ca­tion has been okayed for east­ern­most state Sabah to help it com­bat the coron­avirus pan­demic and the eco­nomic fall­out.</p>
    <p>Sabah has be­come the state worst hit by the pan­demic, reg­is­ter­ing a quar­ter of all cases and deaths from the coron­avirus in Malaysia.</p>
