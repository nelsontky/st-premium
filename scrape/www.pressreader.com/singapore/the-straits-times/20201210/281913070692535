    <p>Google and Face­book won a key con­ces­sion in Aus­tralia as the gov­ern­ment un­veiled de­tails of a world-first law to force the dig­i­tal giants to pay to dis­play news ar­ti­cles.</p>
    <p>The leg­is­la­tion, in­tro­duced to Aus­tralia’s Par­lia­ment yes­ter­day, re­quires Google and Face­book to com­pen­sate pub­lish­ers for the value their sto­ries gen­er­ate for the plat­forms.</p>
    <p>But in a mod­i­fi­ca­tion to an ear­lier draft, the leg­is­la­tion now also recog­nises the mone­tary value the tech­nol­ogy com­pa­nies’ plat­forms pro­vide to news busi­nesses by di­rect­ing read­ers to their web­sites.</p>
    <p>While the de­tails will be de­bated by law­mak­ers and could be al­tered, the change in word­ing fol­lows a months-long cam­paign by Google to have the law blunted.</p>
    <p>The tech gi­ant had ar­gued that pub­lish­ers also ben­e­fit from ad­di­tional read­er­ship on­line when ar­ti­cles are avail­able on plat­forms.</p>
    <p>Face­book had taken a harder line. The United States so­cial me­dia com­pany threat­ened to block Australian­s from shar­ing any news on its sites if the law is passed.</p>
    <p>The dif­fer­ent re­sponses have made Aus­tralia a test case as watch­dogs world­wide seek to rein in the vast ad­ver­tis­ing power of the dig­i­tal giants.</p>
    <p>A spokesman for Google, owned by Al­pha­bet, said it is too early to com­ment on the leg­is­la­tion.</p>
    <p>Mod­er­at­ing its ear­lier stance, Face­book said yes­ter­day it was re­view­ing the Aus­tralian leg­is­la­tion.</p>
    <p>“We’ll con­tinue to en­gage through the up­com­ing par­lia­men­tary process with the goal of land­ing on a work­able frame­work to sup­port Aus­tralia’s news ecosys­tem,” Mr Will Eas­ton, man­ag­ing di­rec­tor of Face­book Aus­tralia, said in a state­ment.</p>
    <p>The leg­is­la­tion is de­signed to sup­port the lo­cal me­dia in­dus­try, in­clud­ing Mr Ru­pert Mur­doch’s News Corp, that has strug­gled to adapt to the dig­i­tal econ­omy.</p>
    <p>“Aus­tralian news me­dia busi­nesses need to be fairly com­pen­sated for gen­er­at­ing orig­i­nal con­tent and the rules of the dig­i­tal world should mir­ror the rules of the phys­i­cal world,” Aus­tralian Trea­surer Josh Fry­den­berg said on his web­site. “This new manda­tory bar­gain­ing code is a world first.”</p>
    <p>An ar­bi­tra­tion panel will de­cide how much the tech com­pa­nies must pay pub­lish­ers if both sides can­not agree on pay­ments on their own, ac­cord­ing to the law, which the gov­ern­ment does not ex­pect to be leg­is­lated this week be­fore Par­lia­ment goes on hia­tus un­til next Fe­bru­ary.</p>
