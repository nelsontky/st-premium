    <p>How do you de­velop the love of read­ing in your child and what should he or she read? Are fairy tales still rel­e­vant to­day?</p>
    <p>Here is what ev­ery mum and dad should know.</p>
    <p>1 KNOW</p>
    <p>YOUR CHILD: What does your lit­tle one like and dis­like? Know­ing your child’s per­son­al­ity and devel­op­ment stage will help you choose books that he or she will en­joy.</p>
    <p>2 MAKE</p>
    <p>READ­ING FUN: When your kid as­so­ciates an ac­tiv­ity with a joy­ful ex­pe­ri­ence, he or she is go­ing to love it and con­tinue with it.</p>
    <p>The same goes for read­ing. Use dif­fer­ent voices to an­i­mate the char­ac­ters.</p>
    <p>Do not force it if your child is not ready to sit down and read. There are ev­ery­day op­por­tu­ni­ties to in­tro­duce read­ing. For ex­am­ple, you can read aloud the words on a ce­real box or sig­nage around you. 3 LET</p>
    <p>YOUR KID LEAD: If your lit­tle one keeps ask­ing for the same book, be pa­tient and con­tinue to read it with him or her till your child out­grows it.</p>
    <p>It is a com­mon phase that young chil­dren go through.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, you can try to in­tro­duce a se­cond story and also leave other books on the ta­ble. One day, your child may be at­tracted to them and want you to read the books with him or her. 4 SPARK</p>
    <p>A CON­VER­SA­TION: As your child grows older, do not just read with him or her. En­gage your kid in a con­ver­sa­tion too.</p>
    <p>For ex­am­ple, if your child loves fairy tales, you can ask: Do you think the princess should just stay in the cas­tle and wait for some­one to res­cue her?</p>
    <p>En­cour­age your kid to think cre­atively and teach him or her right from wrong.</p>
    <p>5 BE</p>
    <p>YOUR CHILD’S ROLE</p>
    <p>MODEL: It is im­por­tant to show that you take plea­sure in read­ing.</p>
    <p>You can­not ex­pect to raise a lit­tle book­worm if your child does not see you read­ing books and news­pa­pers.</p>
    <p>Your kid is ob­serv­ing you all the time – and you are his or her role model.</p>
