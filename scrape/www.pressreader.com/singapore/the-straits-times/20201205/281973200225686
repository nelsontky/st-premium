    <p>If bil­lion­aire Seo Jung-jin had his way, South Korea could be free of the coro­n­avirus by spring next year.</p>
    <p>His bio­phar­ma­ceu­ti­cal firm Celltrion is on track to seek con­di­tional ap­proval for the coun­try’s first Covid-19 medicine – mon­o­clonal an­ti­body treat­ment CT-P59 – by the end of the month, and to pro­duce enough to treat up to two mil­lion pa­tients a year.</p>
    <p>The drug is said to com­ple­ment vac­cines, as it stops the virus from fur­ther in­fect­ing hu­man cells.</p>
    <p>Clin­i­cal tri­als showed that the treat­ment can kill the virus in four to five days and help pa­tients make a full re­cov­ery 44 per cent faster.</p>
    <p>Celltrion, one of South Korea’s largest drug­mak­ers, in­vested 300 bil­lion won (S$370 mil­lion) into its an­ti­body drug. About 100,000 doses have al­ready been made for do­mes­tic use. The coun­try has re­ported more than 36,000 con­firmed cases of the virus.</p>
    <p>“Glob­ally, there is am­ple vac­cine pro­duc­tion but a short­age of treat­ments, but Kore­ans don’t need to worry be­cause there is a sup­ply of</p>
    <p>Celltrion treat­ments to spare,” Mr Seo, 63, told Hanky­oreh news­pa­per last month.</p>
    <p>He also voiced hope that South Korea will be “corona-free” by next spring, so peo­ple can go about their daily lives without wear­ing masks.</p>
    <p>The chair­man of Celltrion is known to make bold de­ci­sions and dream big.</p>
    <p>Born in Cheongju in the cen­tral North Chungcheon­g province, he stud­ied in­dus­trial engi­neer­ing and was work­ing for Dae­woo Mo­tors when it went bank­rupt dur­ing the 1997-1998 Asian fi­nan­cial cri­sis. He started his own biotech com­pany with for­mer col­leagues, with a cap­i­tal of only 50 mil­lion won.</p>
    <p>Mr Seo spot­ted the fu­ture po­ten­tial of biosim­i­lars – cheap copies of ex­pen­sive bi­o­logic drugs used to treat dis­eases such as can­cer – and plunged into re­search­ing them.</p>
    <p>“I bet I am prob­a­bly the busi­ness­man who has seen more breast can­cer cells than any­one,” he once told the Fi­nan­cial Times.</p>
    <p>He had to bor­row money from loan sharks to fund his re­search, and things looked up only in 2010 when Sin­ga­pore’s Te­masek in­jected 207.9 bil­lion won into the com­pany. Celltrion’s mar­ket cap­i­tal­i­sa­tion is now US$23.1 bil­lion (S$30.8 bil­lion), mak­ing Mr Seo the sec­ond rich­est man in South Korea.</p>
    <p>He is slated to re­tire by Dec 31, af­ter which he plans to in­vest 2 tril­lion won in a start-up fo­cused on telemedici­ne tech­nolo­gies.</p>
    <p>For now though, Mr Seo’s fo­cus is on mak­ing Covid-19 treat­ment af­ford­able.</p>
    <p>“We have promised the peo­ple of Korea that our Covid-19 an­ti­body treat­ment will be avail­able to them at pro­duc­tion cost,” he said, adding that the sale price over­seas would also be lower than ri­vals’.</p>
    <p>“Dur­ing a pan­demic cri­sis, phar­ma­ceu­ti­cal com­pa­nies must serve as pub­lic as­sets for the coun­try.”</p>
