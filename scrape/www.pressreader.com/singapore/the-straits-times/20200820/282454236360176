    <p>PARIS • Just like the hero­ine of her ac­claimed de­but film Cuties, Maimouna Doucoure knows what it feels like not to be taken se­ri­ously.</p>
    <p>Her re­mark­able por­trait of an 11-year-old French girl and her friends com­ing of age caught be­tween tra­di­tion­al­ist im­mi­grant fam­i­lies and hy­per­sex­u­alised pop cul­ture, won a best di­rec­tor award at the Sun­dance film fes­ti­val ear­lier this year.</p>
    <p>Yet, even after her short Ma­man(s) – Mother(s) – a semi­au­to­bi­o­graph­i­cal tale of grow­ing up in a polyg­a­mous Sene­galese fam­ily in Paris – was gar­landed with awards, some in the French film estab­lish­ment were jaw-drop­pingly con­de­scend­ing about the un­apolo­get­i­cally glam­orous 35-year-old.</p>
    <p>“You made it for her, didn’t you?” her pro­ducer was asked by one mover and shaker, be­fore be­ing told very firmly that it was all her own work.</p>
    <p>“I can’t be­lieve this girl made this film, she is so fem­i­nine,” the sex­ist scep­tic re­peated.</p>
    <p>When Doucoure won at Sun­dance with Cuties – which has since been snapped up by Net­flix – she called out the doubters pub­licly.</p>
    <p>“I want to say to this guy and every­one who thinks that fem­i­nin­ity means you don’t have the power to think, write, lead and cre­ate, women are ca­pa­ble of do­ing ev­ery­thing,” she de­clared to deaf­en­ing cheers.</p>
    <p>But young black women artists do not only have to climb a wall of prej­u­dice from the out­side, said Doucoure, as Cuties was re­leased in France. They also have to face down sab­o­tage from their own com­mu­ni­ties and even their fam­i­lies.</p>
    <p>“When I was small, I was for­bid­den from dream­ing,” said the di­rec­tor. Her mother, a cleaner, told her that mak­ing films was not for “the likes of her” – that peo­ple who made films did not look like her. In other words, black women.</p>
    <p>“I lacked role mod­els so badly when I was grow­ing up,” Doucoure said of her child­hood in a large polyg­a­mous fam­ily i n north­ern Paris presided over by her bin­man fa­ther.</p>
    <p>“Tele­vi­sion is a sort of mir­ror of so­ci­ety, but for me, I never saw my re­flec­tion in it. Which makes it quite dif­fi­cult after­wards to open up all the imag­i­na­tive pos­si­bil­i­ties,” she added.</p>
    <p>But Doucoure has proved her mother and a lot of oth­ers wrong. And she has a sense of her­self open­ing the way for oth­ers, help­ing to “knock down the men­tal bar­ri­ers” that have held black women back.</p>
    <p>In­deed, in her rous­ing Sun­dance ac­cep­tance speech, she quoted Oprah Win­frey’s maxim that “you be­come what you be­lieve”.</p>
    <p>“Be­lieve ladies,” Doucoure de­clared. With both the #Me­Too and Black Lives Mat­ter move­ments caus­ing earth­quakes within the en­ter­tain­ment in­dus­try, she be­lieves the times are chang­ing.</p>
    <p>Doucoure proudly re­counts march­ing along­side French ac­tress Adele Haenel and Girl­hood (2014) and Por­trait Of A Lady On Fire (2019) di­rec­tor Ce­line Sci­amma at a protest in the Paris sub­urbs over the death i n po­lice cus­tody of</p>
    <p>Mr Adama Traore, the black young man who is seen by many as the French Ge­orge Floyd.</p>
    <p>“Things are mov­ing, I have the feel­ing that I am com­ing through at the right mo­ment,” said Doucoure.</p>
    <p>Nor does she feel like she is on her own.</p>
    <p>The black Bri­tish writer-di­rec­tor Michaela Coel – whose par­ents come from Ghana – has won huge plau­dits for her hard-hit­ting dat­er­ape se­ries I May De­stroy You, while Issa Rae – who, like Doucoure, has Sene­galese roots – has be­come a small-screen phe­nom­e­non for her se­ries In­se­cure (2016 to present) and Awk­ward Black Girl (2011 to 2013), in which, like Coel, she also plays the lead.</p>
    <p>And an­other Parisian, Mati Diop, won the grand jury prize at the Cannes film fes­ti­val last year for At­lantics, which she shot in Sene­gal, where her mu­si­cian fa­ther Wa­sis Diop was born.</p>
    <p>Doucoure also points to t he un­ex­pected suc­cess of Jean-Pas­cal Zadi’s clever com­edy Tout Sim­ple­ment Noir (Very Sim­ply Black, 2020) – one of the big­gest hits of the sum­mer in French cin­e­mas – as an­other sign of progress.</p>
    <p>But there is still much to do.</p>
    <p>“We need dif­fer­ent mod­els al­to­gether, to blow up the bar­ri­ers with fic­tion,” said Doucoure. “From the mo­ment when we open imag­i­na­tions, all will be­come pos­si­ble.”</p>
    <p>Hav­ing writ­ten and pre­pared Cuties while she was preg­nant, and cast it car­ry­ing her daugh­ter in a sling, Doucoure said she is an ex­am­ple of what is pos­si­ble.</p>
    <p>She is proud to be a sym­bol of the open­ing up of France’s of­ten cliquish cin­ema cul­ture which she said “is above all a sport of the rich”.</p>
    <p>The di­rec­tor is work­ing on two new films, one of which, cen­tred on so­cial me­dia, will start shoot­ing soon – coro­n­avirus per­mit­ting.</p>
    <p>“When young girls can get 400,000 likes by do­ing a sexy selfie... We have to of­fer them an­other way of be­ing. To dream of be­ing fe­male as­tro­nauts, en­gi­neers or pres­i­dents...”</p>
    <p>Or even film di­rec­tors.</p>
