    <p>Sev­eral uni­ver­si­ties in Sin­ga­pore al­ready have cour­ses that strad­dle dis­ci­plines in a bid to of­fer un­der­grad­u­ates a broad-based ed­u­ca­tion, ex­perts said.</p>
    <p>In par­tic­u­lar, tertiary in­sti­tu­tions with cur­ric­ula in­flu­enced by the US model al­low students to break out of si­los such as purely hu­man­i­ties or hard sciences cour­ses, said Na­tional In­sti­tute of Ed­u­ca­tion don Ja­son Tan.</p>
    <p>These in­sti­tu­tions in­clude the Sin­ga­pore University of Tech­nol­ogy and De­sign (SUTD), Yale-NUS Col­lege and Sin­ga­pore Man­age­ment University (SMU).</p>
    <p>For in­stance, de­spite its fo­cus on tech­nol­ogy, SUTD re­quires students to take cour­ses in the hu­man­i­ties and so­cial sciences, As­so­ciate Pro­fes­sor Tan said.</p>
    <p>And Nanyang Tech­no­log­i­cal University (NTU) of­fers cour­ses that al­low students to com­bine sub­jects from dif­fer­ent spe­cialised fields, such as en­gi­neer­ing and busi­ness.</p>
    <p>On Wed­nes­day, The Straits Times re­ported that the Na­tional University of Sin­ga­pore (NUS) plans to bring to­gether its Fac­ulty of Arts and So­cial Sciences and Fac­ulty of Sci­ence to form a Col­lege of Hu­man­i­ties and Sciences.</p>
    <p>If these plans are ap­proved by the au­thor­i­ties, the col­lege could be­gin ac­cept­ing students next Au­gust, for the next aca­demic year.</p>
    <p>Students will be able to take cour­ses across dis­ci­plines be­fore choos­ing a spe­cial­i­sa­tion. They will also have ac­cess to fa­cil­i­ties and cour­ses in both the NUS fac­ul­ties, which will still ex­ist. This will al­low students to em­brace dis­ci­plines across the hu­man­i­ties, so­cial sciences, sci­ence and math­e­mat­ics.</p>
    <p>Ex­perts said the move by NUS fol­lows in the foot­steps of uni­ver­si­ties in Sin­ga­pore and abroad that adopt a broad-based or lib­eral arts ap­proach popular in the United States.</p>
    <p>For in­stance, a key fea­ture at Yale-NUS Col­lege is a com­mon cur­ricu­lum. All students take mod­ules such as quan­ti­ta­tive rea­son­ing, sci­en­tific in­quiry and mod­ern so­cial thought.</p>
    <p>Prof Tan said the move by NUS indi­cates that it recog­nises that old ways of teach­ing and learn­ing may no longer be enough. “How­ever, it is harder to dis­man­tle long-es­tab­lished struc­tures than to start some­thing brand-new, which is an ad­van­tage the younger uni­ver­si­ties have.</p>
    <p>“The fact that NUS is do­ing this now shows that they see the ur­gent need to move in the di­rec­tion of broad-based learn­ing.”</p>
    <p>An NUS spokesman said the new col­lege “will fea­ture some el­e­ments of a US lib­eral arts ed­u­ca­tion”.</p>
    <p>The com­mon cur­ricu­lum to be de­vel­oped will draw on the strengths of both ex­ist­ing fac­ul­ties, whose de­part­ments “have built a strong rep­u­ta­tion for aca­demic and re­search ex­cel­lence” over the years, she added.</p>
    <p>She said: “NUS has had suc­cess­ful ex­pe­ri­ences with de­liv­er­ing in­ter­dis­ci­pli­nary stud­ies in smaller set­tings, such as the University Schol­ars Pro­gramme, Res­i­den­tial Col­lege Pro­grammes and Spe­cial Pro­gramme in Sci­ence.”</p>
    <p>NUS now wants to ex­pand this model through the new col­lege to ben­e­fit more students, she added.</p>
    <p>NTU had ear­lier an­nounced plans for a com­mon core cur­ricu­lum for all un­der­grad­u­ates en­ter­ing next Au­gust – ex­cept for those in its med­i­cal school.</p>
    <p>The mod­ules, which will take up a fifth of the aca­demic work­load, are meant to en­able students to in­te­grate knowl­edge across dis­ci­plines and de­velop skills in com­mu­ni­ca­tion, dig­i­tal lit­er­acy, en­ter­prise and in­no­va­tion, among oth­ers, NTU said.</p>
    <p>Pro­fes­sor Tan Ooi Kiang, NTU’s deputy provost for ed­u­ca­tion, said the university has in­ter­dis­ci­pli­nary pro­grammes such as the Re­nais­sance En­gi­neer­ing Pro­gramme, which blends en­gi­neer­ing with busi­ness and hu­man­i­ties.</p>
    <p>SMU provost Ti­mothy Clark said its un­der­grad­u­ate cur­ricu­lum al­ready of­fers a high level of flex­i­bil­ity. “Our students may en­rol for cour­ses across schools re­gard­less of the de­gree pro­gramme they are en­rolled in,” he said.</p>
    <p>Most SMU students grad­u­ate with a sec­ond ma­jor, a sec­ond de­gree, or both.</p>
    <p>Pro­fes­sor Clark said SMU has com­mon core mod­ules that form 33 per cent of its un­der­grad­u­ate cur­ricu­lum, and the university has also launched ini­tia­tives for students to work in mul­ti­dis­ci­plinary teams to ad­dress ac­tual in­dus­try prob­lems.</p>
    <p>Re­cruit­ment ex­perts said hav­ing both spe­cialised and soft skills is nec­es­sary in today’s job mar­ket. They added that an in­ter­dis­ci­pli­nary ed­u­ca­tion can help grad­u­ates be more flex­i­ble and open-minded as they solve real-world prob­lems.</p>
    <p>Mr David Leong, man­ag­ing direc­tor of hu­man re­source con­sul­tancy Peo­pleWorld­wide Con­sult­ing, said the larger col­lege planned by NUS should pro­mote flex­i­ble study com­bi­na­tions of hu­man­i­ties and sciences.</p>
    <p>“This should re­sult in grad­u­ates with more bal­anced per­spec­tives, which can help them ad­dress global is­sues dif­fer­ently,” he said.</p>
    <p>Mr Vi­nay Dua, man­ag­ing direc­tor of re­cruit­ment firm Ca­reerBuilde­r Sin­ga­pore, said em­ploy­ers are in­creas­ingly look­ing out for skills and ap­ti­tude over qual­i­fi­ca­tions.</p>
    <p>“A per­son with a di­verse or in­ter­dis­ci­pli­nary ed­u­ca­tion of­fers more chances for him to ex­per­i­ment in his ca­reer,” he said.</p>
    <p>It is harder to dis­man­tle long-es­tab­lished struc­tures than to start some­thing brand-new, which is an ad­van­tage the younger uni­ver­si­ties have. The fact that NUS is do­ing this now shows that they see the ur­gent need to move in the di­rec­tion of broad-based learn­ing.</p>
