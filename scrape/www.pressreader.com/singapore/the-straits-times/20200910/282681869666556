    <p>Hong Kong star Gillian Chung (right) went for a sec­ond op­er­a­tion late on Mon­day af­ter suf­fer­ing a head in­jury in Xi­a­men, China.</p>
    <p>Chung, one half of Can­topop duo Twins with ac­tress-singer Char­lene Choi, had an ac­ci­dent at about 2am that day in her ho­tel room.</p>
    <p>The 39-year-old singer-ac­tress was plan­ning to go to the toi­let when she felt giddy and lost her bal­ance, hit­ting her head against a mar­ble struc­ture.</p>
    <p>Her wound was re­ported to be 6cm long and she needed dozens of stitches at the hos­pi­tal. There were con­cerns that the stitches might leave scars on her face.</p>
    <p>Chung’s man­ager Mani Fok told the Hong Kong me­dia on Tues­day that the sec­ond op­er­a­tion was done by a top plas­tic sur­geon in­tro­duced by Hong Kong ac­tor Si­mon Yam.</p>
    <p>She said the sur­geon had to stitch to­gether three lay­ers of the wounded area, which was deep enough to ex­pose the bone. There were “hun­dreds of stitches”, with the sur­face layer need­ing 66 stitches.</p>
    <p>“As it was done by a plas­tic sur­geon this time, there were many stitches which were del­i­cate as the doc­tor hoped to re­duce the like­li­hood of scar­ring,” Ms Fok said.</p>
    <p>She added that the brain-scan re­sult showed that Chung did not suf­fer any brain in­jury and she did not vomit in the sub­se­quent 24 hours ei­ther.</p>
    <p>The man­ager said other celebri­ties, such as Choi, singer Joey Yung, ac­tress Kara Wai and ac­tor Ray­mond Lam, have of­fered their help af­ter learn­ing of Chung’s in­jury.</p>
    <p>Yung took the first flight from Bei­jing to Xi­a­men with Ms Fok on Mon­day af­ter she l earnt of the ac­ci­dent.</p>
    <p>Ms Fok said Chung is re­cov­er­ing in the ho­tel room af­ter her op­er­a­tion.</p>
    <p>She said the singer-ac­tress is in China to film two Web tele­vi­sion se­ri­als, with Mon­day sup­posed to be the last day of film­ing for one of the shows.</p>
    <p>She is likely to re­turn to Hong Kong only af­ter shoot­ing is com­plete for both shows.</p>
    <p>Chung had made the news in May af­ter di­vorc­ing Tai­wanese aes­thet­ics doc­tor Michael Lai, 31. They mar­ried in 2018 and have no chil­dren.</p>
