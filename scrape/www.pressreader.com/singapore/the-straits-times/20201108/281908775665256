    <p>When Ms Ong Pei Yi was 26, she scored her dream job: A flight at­ten­dant with Sin­ga­pore Air­lines (SIA). Ms Ong shares that her stint with the na­tional car­rier helped her to ful­fil her child­hood dream of be­com­ing a “Sin­ga­pore Girl” and sate her cu­rios­ity in the ser­vice sec­tor.</p>
    <p>But her dream was short-lived. While re­ward­ing, the job re­quired her to travel reg­u­larly, for an av­er­age of 20 days a month, lim­it­ing the amount of time she could spend with her par­ents.</p>
    <p>“My mom is get­ting on in years and I wanted very much to be in Sin­ga­pore more of­ten so that I could be around her,” says the 29-year-old, who lives with her mother and father, both 67, in a four-room Hous­ing Board flat in Yishun.</p>
    <p>In 2004, her father suf­fered a stroke that af­fected his abil­ity to walk . With her father un­able to work, the fam­ily feared that they would not be able to pay for his liv­ing ex­penses after he was dis­charged from the hospi­tal.</p>
    <p>A five-fig­ure in­surance pay­out from the Depen­dants’ Pro­tec­tion Scheme (DPS) — a termlife in­surance scheme that au­to­mat­i­cally cov­ers Sin­ga­pore­ans and per­ma­nent res­i­dents upon their first con­tri­bu­tion to the Cen­tral Prov­i­dent Fund — helped to de­fray those costs.</p>
    <p>It was a great weight off her fam­ily ’s shoul­ders, Ms Ong re­counts. “Since then, I have al­ways ap­pre­ci­ated the im­por­tance of in­surance and how it could re­ally help a fam­ily in dif­fi­cult times.”</p>
    <p>Keen to share the im­por­tance of in­surance with oth­ers, she left SIA after 17 months to join Great Eastern as a fi­nan­cial rep­re­sen­ta­tive in Oc­to­ber last year.</p>
    <p>The ca­reer switch was ini­tially chal­leng­ing, she ad­mits, but the cus­tomer ser­vice skills de­vel­oped from her time with SIA proved use­ful.</p>
    <p>“When it comes to reach­ing out to prospec­tive clients, I am able to com­mu­ni­cate eas­ily with them.”</p>
    <p>Just a year into the job, Ms Ong is al­ready find­ing her new ca­reer path re­ward­ing.</p>
    <p>Like most of the young polled, she ap­pre­ci­ates the flex­i­bil­ity and in­de­pen­dence. “My hours are re­ally flex­i­ble and I get full au­ton­omy to plan my time and sched­ule around my fam­ily com­mit­ments.”</p>
    <p>“I’m glad to be able to in­tro­duce and of­fer fi­nan­cial prod­ucts to my clients that could ben­e­fit their lives mean­ing­fully.”</p>
