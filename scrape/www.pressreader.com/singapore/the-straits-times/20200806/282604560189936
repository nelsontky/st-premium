    <p>NEW YORK • As the coron­avirus con­tin­ues to rage and Hol­ly­wood’s pro­duc­tion shut­down per­sists, new episodes of tele­vi­sion sit­coms may soon be in short sup­ply. But that does not mean you need to forgo a com­edy fix. Whether you are crav­ing the binge-wor­thy laughs of a scripted se­ries or the elec­tric wit of live sets, these five pod­casts will bring you some much-needed comic re­lief.</p>
    <p>1 BODEGA BOYS</p>
    <p>Be­fore the Bronx com­edy duo De­sus Nice and the Kid Mero be­came widely known as the hosts of their self­ti­tled late-night Showtime se­ries, they built a loyal fol­low­ing through their con­sis­tently hi­lar­i­ous Bodega Boys pod­cast.</p>
    <p>This weekly two-han­der shows off their chem­istry, ob­ser­va­tional hu­mour and im­pec­ca­ble comic timing.</p>
    <p>The long­time friends riff at break­neck speed on sub­jects both broad and niche. Some weeks they delve into pop cul­ture or roast politi­cians, while other episodes are full of slice-of-life anec­dotes about the duo’s past and present lives in New York City.</p>
    <p>Bodega Boys is one of the best ex­am­ples of pod­casts’ abil­ity to show­case fu­ture stars.</p>
    <p>2 A VERY FA­TAL MUR­DER</p>
    <p>Early in the first episode of this scripted mock­u­men­tary from The Onion, there is a skit that per­fectly cap­tures how the show skew­ers true-crime pod­cast­ing.</p>
    <p>The fic­tional host, David Pas­call – voiced by David Si­dorov in an earnest mono­tone – en­lists a su­per­com­puter to help him find a mur­der case that is tai­lor-made for a pod­cast in­ves­ti­ga­tion.</p>
    <p>“Set a filter for fe­male vic­tims only,” he tells the bot, ex­plain­ing that he needs to find a cul­tur­ally rel­e­vant and thought-pro­vok­ing case that also in­volves “a mur­der where a re­ally hot white girl dies”.</p>
    <p>Af­ter iden­ti­fy­ing the per­fect (fic­tional) mur­der of a prom queen in a small fac­tory town, A Very Fa­tal Mur­der de­liv­ers snappy 15-minute bursts of true-crime satire, com­plete with in­con­gru­ously chirpy ads for fake meal-de­liv­ery ser­vices that in­ter­rupt the grue­some mur­der in­ves­ti­ga­tion.</p>
    <p>3 LAS CULTURISTA­S</p>
    <p>There is no short­age of pod­casts that fol­low the ba­sic for­mat of Las Culturista­s: witty ban­ter be­tween co­hosts, fol­lowed by a guest-of-the-week in­ter­view.</p>
    <p>But thanks to co­me­di­ans Bowen Yang and Matt Rogers’ pal­pa­ble pas­sion for pop cul­ture, this is one joy­ful and up­lift­ing au­dio ex­pe­ri­ence with a per­fect bal­ance of snark and heart.</p>
    <p>In each episode, a guest dis­cusses the pop cul­ture that shaped him or her – and, in a reg­u­lar seg­ment ti­tled I Don’t Think So, Honey!, rants for 60 sec­onds about a pop cul­ture pet peeve.</p>
    <p>Even as the hosts have found wider recog­ni­tion – Yang re­cently be­came the first Chi­nese-Amer­i­can cast mem­ber on Satur­day Night Live – the show has avoided be­com­ing too in­sider-y, re­tain­ing the re­lat­able per­spec­tive that makes it such a re­ward­ing lis­ten.</p>
    <p>4 NO SUCH THING AS A FISH</p>
    <p>For fans of the beloved Bri­tish com­edy main­stay QI, the em­pha­sis on ob­scure trivia in this spin-off pod­cast will feel fa­mil­iar. For the unini­ti­ated, No Such Thing As A Fish sees the re­searchers be­hind QI, which stands for Quite In­ter­est­ing, dis­cuss the best sur­pris­ing facts they’ve re­cently learnt, like the epony­mous fact that there is, in fact, no such thing as a fish.</p>
    <p>Hosts Dan Schreiber, James Harkin, An­drew Hunter Mur­ray and Anna Ptaszyn­ski have such a wealth of weird, fas­ci­nat­ing knowl­edge at their fin­ger­tips that the show has never had a dud episode in its six-year run.</p>
    <p>5 THE READ</p>
    <p>The self-de­scribed mis­sion of this show from co­me­di­ans Kid Fury and Crissle West is “throw­ing shade and spilling tea with a flip­pant and hu­mor­ous at­ti­tude”, which means de­liv­er­ing frank truths about pop cul­ture and its stars.</p>
    <p>Now in its sev­enth year, the episodes break down into a few broad seg­ments: the drily hi­lar­i­ous Fury and West dis­cuss pop cul­ture news, re­spond to lis­tener e-mails and hand out a weekly Black Ex­cel­lence award.</p>
    <p>Fi­nally they “read” (give their bru­tally hon­est opin­ions on) a per­son, trend or event, de­liv­er­ing wellde­served take­downs with nu­ance and a light­ness that never feels mean-spir­ited.</p>
