    <p>OVER THE MOON</p>
    <p>This Net­flix an­i­mated mu­si­cal is what Dis­ney’s Mu­lan re­make should have been: an up­beat cel­e­bra­tion of a girl over­com­ing the odds, not the dour lec­ture about val­ues that au­di­ences got in­stead.</p>
    <p>As in Mu­lan, the story here con­cerns a Chi­nese girl who is told to know her lim­its.</p>
    <p>Ad­mit­tedly, the stakes are lower. Teenager Fei Fei (voiced by Cathy Ang) just wants to prove that the leg­end of the moon god­dess Chang’e is real – it’s her link to a painful past that she will not re­lease.</p>
    <p>In try­ing to prove to her scep­ti­cal fam­ily that Chang’e still lives on the moon and pines for her hus­band, the archer Hou Yi, Fei Fei steps into a look­ing-glass world of fan­tas­ti­cal crea­tures that em­body the Mid-Au­tumn Fes­ti­val, as well as those that are purely the cre­ation of sto­ry­tellers.</p>
    <p>Glen Keane, di­rec­tor and for­mer Walt Dis­ney An­i­ma­tion Stu­dios alum­nus – work­ing with a screen­play by Alice Wu, Au­drey Wells and Jen­nifer Yee McDe­vitt – makes the songs and vi­su­als do the heavy lift­ing, which is the proper Dis­ney thing to do.</p>
    <p>It is a style that fans of Dis­ney princess sto­ries such as Frozen (2013) will ap­pre­ci­ate.</p>
    <p>Chang’e (voiced by Phillipa Soo), for ex­am­ple, is in­tro­duced with a roof-rais­ing an­them declar­ing her per­sonal au­ton­omy – set against vi­su­als unique to Chi­nese co-pro­duc­ers Pearl Stu­dio.</p>
    <p>The moon­scapes are de­light­ful, but the town that Fei Fei calls home is stun­ning.</p>
    <p>It is a Dis­ney theme park ver­sion of China – with curved roofs and quiet streets, with­out a fast-food joint in view. It is iden­ti­fi­ably Chi­nese with­out laps­ing into Chi­na­town kitsch.</p>
    <p>With a home town like that, Fei Fei should have been more re­luc­tant to leave for her lu­nar ad­ven­ture.</p>
    <p>THE SI­LENC­ING</p>
    <p>This crime thriller starts promis­ingly enough. Ray­burn (Niko­laj Coster-Wal­dau) is a Un­abomber-style loner who has iso­lated him­self on his pri­vate na­ture re­serve, nurs­ing a se­cret pain and a dis­like of author­ity.</p>
    <p>The town’s sher­iff, Gustafson (Annabelle Wal­lis), dis­cov­ers a mur­der in which the fe­male vic­tim has been kid­napped and taken to the woods to be hunted for sport. Ray­burn is im­pli­cated.</p>
    <p>It goes rapidly down­hill from there. The story strains to make its two lead­ing char­ac­ters, Gustafson and Ray­burn, psy­cho­log­i­cally tor­tured in the hope of mak­ing them more in­ter­est­ing – in the style of edgy cop shows such as HBO se­ries True De­tec­tive (2014 to present).</p>
    <p>This movie for­gets that the char­ac­ter stuff is the side dish, not the main course, and serves an in­sult­ingly un­der-pre­pared crime pro­ce­dural.</p>
    <p>BLOOD VES­SEL</p>
    <p>At sev­eral points in this ship-based corpse fest, a rea­son­able per­son watch­ing it might ask: “When is this go­ing to get funny?”</p>
    <p>One can­not be blamed for think­ing this is a hor­ror-com­edy. There is the pun in the ti­tle, for starters.</p>
    <p>A mixed group of men and one woman from Al­lied na­tions in a lifeboat clam­ber onto an empty ves­sel dur­ing World War II. A tor­pedo at­tack has sunk their hos­pi­tal ship and the cursed tub is their only hope.</p>
    <p>There is more here that will make view­ers wish the film-mak­ers had ex­ploited the set-up’s comic po­ten­tial. From the bad ac­cents, to the lazy lib­er­ties taken with war history, to the crea­ture ef­fects lifted</p>
    <p>from a ba­sic cable tele­vi­sion show, noth­ing here can be taken se­ri­ously in spite of how stren­u­ously the movie tries to be grim.</p>
    <p>GHOSTS OF WAR / YOUR EYES TELL</p>
    <p>Other films open­ing this week but not re­viewed in­clude Ghosts Of War which, like Blood Ves­sel, is a work of su­per­nat­u­ral hor­ror set in World War II.</p>
    <p>Aus­tralian ac­tor Bren­ton Th­waites stars in a story about a group of Al­lied sol­diers hun­kered in a French chateau, who dis­cover they are not the only dan­ger­ous crea­tures lurk­ing in the build­ing’s shad­ows.</p>
    <p>In the Ja­panese ro­man­tic drama Your Eyes Tell, Rui (Ryu­sei Yoko­hama) is a with­drawn for­mer kick­boxer who meets Akari (Yuriko Yoshi­taka), a blind woman with a sun­nier, more so­cial dis­po­si­tion. Their bud­ding re­la­tion­ship forces Rui to con­front his hid­den past.</p>
