    <p>Ser­vice­men train­ing at eight mil­i­tary sites will soon get free Wi-Fi ac­cess un­der a pi­lot pro­gramme that taps the Wire­less@SGx net­work, which has thou­sands of hot spots across Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>In re­sponse to queries from The Sun­day Times, a Min­istry of De­fence (Min­def) spokesman said the eight Min­def and Sin­ga­pore Armed Forces (SAF) sites will have ac­cess to the net­work by the first half of next year.</p>
    <p>The sites are: Air Force Train­ing Com­mand, Cen­tral Man­power Base, Changi Naval Base, Hil­lview Camp, Jurong Camp II, Kranji Camp II, the Min­istry of De­fence build­ing and Stag­mont Camp.</p>
    <p>The ser­vice will pro­gres­sively be rolled out to other premises and camps in the next few years af­ter the pi­lot tri­als, added the spokesman.</p>
    <p>Wire­less@SGx is the up­dated ver­sion of Wire­less@SG, a free pub­lic Wi-Fi pro­gramme in­tro­duced in 2006 that has most of its hot spots in pub­lic ar­eas with high foot­falls, in­clud­ing hawker cen­tres, com­mu­nity cen­tres and li­braries.</p>
    <p>ST re­ported that there were more than 20,000 such hot spots in 2018, with min­i­mum surf­ing speeds of 5Mbps, although av­er­age surf­ing speeds were over 30Mbps, de­pend­ing on user den­sity in a given area.</p>
    <p>The Min­def spokesman said that by scal­ing up wire­less broad­band ac­cess, con­nec­tiv­ity will be en­hanced and dig­i­tal­i­sa­tion ini­tia­tives such as Smart Camps and Smart Air­bases will be sup­ported.</p>
    <p>“Full-time na­tional ser­vice­men and op­er­a­tionally ready na­tional ser­vice­men will also be able to ac­cess the free wire­less net­work for elearn­ing and per­sonal ad­min­is­tra­tion,” he said.</p>
    <p>Wire­less@SG will be sep­a­rated from Min­def and SAF’s in­ter­nal net­works for cy­ber and data se­cu­rity, he added.</p>
    <p>While Min­def and SAF premises are equipped with Wi-Fi net­works for in­ter­nal use, most of them are cur­rently not equipped with freely ac­ces­si­ble Wi-Fi net­works such as Wire­less@SG.</p>
    <p>Since 2016, cam­era-en­abled mo­bile phones, lap­tops and tablets have been al­lowed for use in parts of SAF camps, called Green Zones. No cam­era-en­abled de­vices are al­lowed in other ar­eas, called Red Zones.</p>
    <p>Unau­tho­rised pho­tog­ra­phy and videog­ra­phy re­main pro­hib­ited in both zones.</p>
    <p>Smart Camps, un­veiled in 2018, aims to im­prove op­er­a­tional ef­fi­ciency and en­hance the ex­pe­ri­ence of na­tional ser­vice­men – such as with a mo­bile app that al­lows ser­vice­men to have ac­cess to camp, unit and train­ing in­for­ma­tion on the move.</p>
    <p>The Smart Air­bases con­cept, also an­nounced in 2018, aims to have the base com­mand post be bet­ter net­worked to all air­base sys­tems. It will utilise more au­toma­tion and un­manned sys­tems in ar­eas such as air­craft in­spec­tion and main­te­nance.</p>
    <p>When asked to com­ment on this de­vel­op­ment, cy­ber-se­cu­rity firm Group-IB’s Sin­ga­pore-based se­nior threat in­tel­li­gence an­a­lyst Shawn</p>
    <p>Tay said all wire­less net­works carry some cy­ber-se­cu­rity risks.</p>
    <p>“The main risk lies in the fact that ad­ver­saries may try to get ac­cess to the router to ini­ti­ate man-in-themid­dle at­tacks that can en­able hack­ers to read en­crypted data ex­changed be­tween users who are con­nected to the router,” he said.</p>
    <p>But the up­dated Wire­less@SGx net­work rolled out in 2014 has boosted se­cu­rity, he noted.</p>
    <p>This net­work in­stalls a dig­i­tal cer­tifi­cate on the user de­vice via a cer­tifi­cate call as a se­cu­rity mea­sure.</p>
    <p>By early next year, Wire­less@SGx is ex­pected to be­come the only net­work avail­able, Mr Tay said.</p>
    <p>He said that if the Wire­less@SGx cer­tifi­cate is unique to each user, it is far more se­cure. This al­lows a ma­li­cious user to be pin-pointed and have its cer­tifi­cate re­voked.</p>
    <p>“In ad­di­tion, by hav­ing the reg­is­tra­tion de­tails, the au­thor­i­ties can quickly iden­tify the sus­pect – as they al­ready have in­for­ma­tion such as the phone num­ber.”</p>
    <p>RISKS IN­EVITABLE</p>
    <p>The main risk lies in the fact that ad­ver­saries may try to get ac­cess to the router to ini­ti­ate man-in-the-mid­dle at­tacks that can en­able hack­ers to read en­crypted data ex­changed be­tween users who are con­nected to the router.</p>
