    <p>The po­lice will con­tinue to step up pa­trols dur­ing the fes­tive sea­son to project a pres­ence and de­ter pub­lic se­cu­rity threats and crime.</p>
    <p>The Min­istry of Home Af­fairs (MHA) said the po­lice have in­ten­si­fied their pa­trols – in­clud­ing those by their quick-re­sponse coun­tert­er­ror­ism teams – since Septem­ber, fol­low­ing ter­ror in­ci­dents in Europe.</p>
    <p>The height­ened alert by the Home Team was in view of the de­te­ri­o­rat­ing se­cu­rity sit­u­a­tion with a spate of ter­ror­ist at­tacks in France, in­clud­ing the be­head­ing of French teacher Sa­muel Paty in a Paris sub­urb in Oc­to­ber, as well as other at­tacks in Saudi Ara­bia and Aus­tria.</p>
    <p>In re­sponse to queries from The Straits Times, an MHA spokesman stressed that the risk of copy­cat at­tacks in Sin­ga­pore is high, with the coun­try highly sus­cep­ti­ble to be­ing in­flu­enced by ex­ter­nal de­vel­op­ments.</p>
    <p>Ter­ror­ist groups such as the Is­lamic State in Iraq and Syria have ex­horted their fol­low­ers to carry out lone-wolf at­tacks us­ing any means, in­clud­ing with ev­ery­day items like knives and cars, said the spokesman. “Such at­tacks are hard to pre­vent, and can hap­pen quickly with­out much warn­ing.”</p>
    <p>The en­hanced pa­trols in­clude counter-ter­ror­ism pa­trols by the In-Situ Re­ac­tion Teams and Emer­gency Re­sponse Teams, which are equipped and trained to re­spond swiftly to pub­lic se­cu­rity threats.</p>
    <p>Po­lice and se­cu­rity of­fi­cers will also be de­ployed dur­ing the yearend fes­tiv­i­ties to de­ter crime and re­spond to any law and or­der in­ci­dents, added the spokesman.</p>
    <p>The Im­mi­gra­tion and Check­points Au­thor­ity has also stepped up se­cu­rity checks and screen­ing at all check­points, and in­creased the fre­quency of pa­trols.</p>
    <p>The au­thor­i­ties said last month that in­ves­ti­ga­tions into 37 peo­ple have started for sus­pected rad­i­cal in­cli­na­tions, or for mak­ing com­ments which in­cite vi­o­lence or stoke com­mu­nal un­rest.</p>
    <p>Among them was Bangladesh­i con­struc­tion worker Ahmed Faysal, 26, who was found to have been rad­i­calised and had in­tended to carry out acts of armed vi­o­lence in sup­port of his re­li­gion, although there was no in­di­ca­tion that he had in­tended to carry out vi­o­lent acts in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>The In­ter­nal Se­cu­rity Depart­ment said he was is­sued with a De­ten­tion Or­der on Nov 30 to fa­cil­i­tate in­ves­ti­ga­tions into his ter­ror­ism-re­lated ac­tiv­i­ties.</p>
    <p>Asked how the au­thor­i­ties judge if an in­di­vid­ual’s ac­tiv­i­ties are dan­ger­ous enough for de­por­ta­tion or de­ten­tion, the MHA spokesman said that any­one who en­gages in con­duct in sup­port of ter­ror­ism, rad­i­cal ide­olo­gies or armed vi­o­lence will be dealt with firmly, re­gard­less of how such vi­o­lence is ra­tio­nalised ide­o­log­i­cally or where the vi­o­lence takes place.</p>
    <p>How each in­di­vid­ual is dealt with is care­fully cal­i­brated, said the spokesman, and is based on the sever­ity of spe­cific in­volve­ment in the con­cerned ac­tiv­i­ties. For­eign­ers must abide by Sin­ga­pore’s laws and en­sure their ac­tiv­i­ties do not jeop­ar­dise the coun­try’s se­cu­rity or com­mu­nal har­mony.</p>
    <p>The spokesman said it was chal­leng­ing to de­tect rad­i­calised in­di­vid­u­als, dis­clos­ing that of all the rad­i­calised in­di­vid­u­als dealt with to date, only a hand­ful were re­ported by their fam­ily or friends, or by mem­bers of the pub­lic.</p>
    <p>Stress­ing that a “whole-of-so­ci­ety ef­fort” is needed, the spokesman said: “All of us have a re­spon­si­bil­ity to be vig­i­lant and to sound the alert if we should come across any sus­pi­cious ac­tiv­i­ties or per­sons who ex­hibit signs of rad­i­cal­i­sa­tion.”</p>
