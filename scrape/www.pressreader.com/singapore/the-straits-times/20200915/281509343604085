    <p>SSO’s online ticket prices start at $10 (and $5 for shows such as the Na­tional Day Con­cert). Its dig­i­tal sea­son ex­ceeded 500,000 views in the first three months.</p>
    <p>More than 1,000 tick­ets were is­sued for its re­cent Na­tional Day Con­cert, and over 1,700 is­sued for the sea­son open­ing con­cert.</p>
    <p>On av­er­age, au­di­ence mem­bers watch 71 per cent of each con­cert. Un­der the pay-as-you-wish model, 38 per cent of the cus­tomers pay higher than the stan­dard amount.</p>
    <p>THE ES­PLANADE</p>
    <p>In May, the Es­planade pulled out three Sin­ga­pore pro­duc­tions from its ar­chives and re­leased them on Sis­tic Live for a week. These shows were Nadi Sin­ga­pura’s Fatih – The Prince & The Drum, Toy Factory Pro­duc­tions’ 7 Sages Of The Bam­boo Grove and Ap­saras Arts’ An­janeyam – Hanu­man’s Ra­mayana.</p>
    <p>Au­di­ences could watch by get­ting a ticket for free or buy­ing it on a pay-as-you-wish ba­sis.</p>
    <p>More than 5,000 tick­ets were is­sued and over 90 per cent of view­ers had not seen the shows when they were first staged.</p>
    <p>Most peo­ple are will­ing to pay no more than</p>
    <p>$20 for an online per­for­mance, ac­cord­ing to data from the cul­tural fes­ti­val screen­ings on Sis­tic Live in May and a sep­a­rate sur­vey.</p>
    <p>SIN­GA­PORE CHI­NESE ORCHES­TRA (SCO)</p>
    <p>The SCO’s poll of 720 peo­ple in July found the ma­jor­ity (65 per cent) were will­ing to pay up to $19 for live-stream con­certs.</p>
    <p>Nearly half said they pre­ferred a pay-as-you-wish model for dig­i­tal con­certs, re­gard­less of show type.</p>
