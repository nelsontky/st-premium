    <p>It is not new for vac­cines to have in­dem­nity and no-fault com­pen­sa­tion mech­a­nisms in place to pro­tect both in­di­vid­u­als and com­pa­nies, while al­low­ing mil­lions to have ac­cess to the shots.</p>
    <p>This looks set to be ap­plied to Covid-19 vac­cines as well, with Pfizer ob­tain­ing in­dem­nity from the Bri­tish gov­ern­ment against any in­ci­dents as coun­tries world­wide start se­cur­ing the Pfizer</p>
    <p>BioNTech Covid-19 vac­cine for their pop­u­la­tions.</p>
    <p>Pres­i­dent of the Sin­ga­pore As­so­ci­a­tion of Phar­ma­ceu­ti­cal In­dus­tries Ashish Pal said at a Straits Times Re­set we­bi­nar on The A-Z Of The Covid-19 Vac­cine yes­ter­day that this is not new for vac­cines.</p>
    <p>“You re­ally want to get to a point where you have a very, very ef­fec­tive use of your re­sources – peo­ple and dol­lars – so that vac­cines are ac­tu­ally ad­min­is­tered and pop­u­la­tions start to ac­quire im­mu­nity,” he said. “To achieve that, you want to look at two dif­fer­ent mech­a­nisms in place – in­dem­nity and no­fault com­pen­sa­tion.”</p>
    <p>No-fault com­pen­sa­tion schemes are used when ac­ci­dents and in­juries are re­garded as in­evitable, and the em­pha­sis is on com­pen­sat­ing vic­tims for re­lated ex­penses, with­out any­one hav­ing to en­ter the civil jus­tice sys­tem and prove that an­other party is li­able for dam­ages.</p>
    <p>“The in­dem­nity clauses are pro­tect­ing gov­ern­ments, dis­trib­u­tors, ad­min­is­tra­tors and providers, and the no-fault com­pen­sa­tion mech­a­nisms are pro­tect­ing pa­tients,” he said, adding that hav­ing the two mech­a­nisms helps cre­ate a con­ducive en­vi­ron­ment for peo­ple to take a vac­cine.</p>
    <p>As­so­ciate Pro­fes­sor Lim Poh Lian, the di­rec­tor of the high-level iso­la­tion unit at the National Cen­tre for In­fec­tious Dis­eases and a mem­ber of the Covid-19 Vac­cine Ex­pert Com­mit­tee, said the is­sue is about bal­anc­ing the vac­cine’s risks and ben­e­fits. “If we vac­ci­nate peo­ple, there are small but known risks, right? But if we don’t vac­ci­nate peo­ple, peo­ple will also get hurt.”</p>
    <p>For in­stance, there is still a onein-a-mil­lion chance of peo­ple con­tract­ing vac­cine-as­so­ci­ated po­lio paral­y­sis. How­ever, be­fore po­lio vac­ci­na­tion, there were 350,000 peo­ple a year with the disease, she said.</p>
    <p>“So we’re not in­dem­ni­fy­ing man­u­fac­tur­ers nec­es­sar­ily against bad work. We’re say­ing that the vac­cine it­self has cer­tain in­trin­sic risks, and by ac­knowl­edg­ing that in­trin­sic risk, we are al­low­ing the ben­e­fit of the vac­cine to be made to the whole pop­u­la­tion, and not nec­es­sar­ily putting fear and a de­fen­sive kind of cli­mate to stop the vac­ci­na­tion process,” she said.</p>
