    <p>Global warm­ing could ex­ceed the key thresh­old of 1.5 deg C by 2024 – far sooner than sci­en­tists had pre­dicted, a ma­jor United Na­tions up­date on cli­mate change in­di­ca­tors said yes­ter­day, adding fur­ther pres­sure on na­tions to rapidly cut fos­sil fuel emis­sions that are heat­ing up the planet.</p>
    <p>The up­date, re­leased by UN agency World Me­te­o­ro­log­i­cal Or­gan­i­sa­tion (WMO), said even the tem­po­rary drop in global green­house gas emis­sions due to Covid-19 lock­downs will have min­i­mal im­pact on the pace of global warm­ing, with 2016-2020 on track to be the warm­est five-year pe­riod on record.</p>
    <p>The 1.5 deg C level is cen­tral to global ef­forts to fight cli­mate change. Un­der the 2015 Paris Cli­mate Agree­ment, nearly 200 na­tions agreed to limit global warm­ing to well be­low 2 deg C and ideally 1.5 deg C, as any­thing above these lev­els would put peo­ple and liveli­hoods at tremen­dous risk.</p>
    <p>Yet, since the pact was agreed, global green­house gas emis­sions have con­tin­ued to grow quickly and most na­tions are far from achiev­ing these Paris tar­gets.</p>
    <p>“While emis­sions fell dur­ing the peak of the pan­demic con­fine­ment mea­sures, they have al­ready mostly re­cov­ered to within 5 per cent of the same pe­riod in 2019 and are likely to in­crease fur­ther,” said UN Sec­re­tary-Gen­eral An­to­nio Guter­res, in a note ac­com­pa­ny­ing the re­port.</p>
    <p>The re­port, ti­tled United In Sci­ence 2020, said there is a one-in­five chance that global an­nual av­er­age tem­per­a­tures will ex­ceed 1.5 deg C above pre-in­dus­trial lev­els for at least one year over the next five years. And there is roughly a 70 per cent chance that one or more months dur­ing the next five years will be at least 1.5 deg C warmer.</p>
    <p>“This first over­shoot be­yond 1.5 deg C would be tem­po­rary, likely aided by a ma­jor cli­mate anom­aly such as an El Nino weather pat­tern. How­ever, it casts new doubt on whether earth’s cli­mate can be per­ma­nently sta­bilised at 1.5 deg C warm­ing,” said Dr Pep Canadell, ex­ec­u­tive di­rec­tor of the Global Car­bon Project (GCP), and his col­league Dr Rob Jack­son, chair of the GCP, in a com­men­tary for The Con­ver­sa­tion web­site yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>El Ni­nos are nat­u­ral events that bring warmer global tem­per­a­tures and usu­ally cause droughts in South-east Asia and parts of Aus­tralia.</p>
    <p>Un­less global car­bon diox­ide (CO2) emis­sions drop sharply this decade, said the UN, there will be no chance of lim­it­ing warm­ing to rel­a­tively safe lev­els. The WMO said the world has al­ready warmed 1.1 deg C on av­er­age since the start of in­dus­trial times and that fur­ther heat­ing will be fu­elled by the steady rise in green­house gas emis­sions, chiefly CO2, meth­ane and ni­trous ox­ide from in­dus­try, trans­port and agricultur­e.</p>
    <p>Even with warm­ing of 1.1 deg C, the world is suf­fer­ing more ex­treme and deadly weather, such as droughts and wild­fires and more in­tense floods and storms. Turn­ing up the global ther­mo­stat even more, and so quickly, will likely worsen those ex­tremes.</p>
    <p>At 2 deg C, the risks to crop pro­duc­tion in­crease, sea level rise speeds up and most coral reefs are badly dam­aged or de­stroyed.</p>
    <p>The United In Sci­ence re­port, pre­pared by six lead­ing sci­ence agen­cies in­clud­ing the GCP, also said for the five-year pe­riod end­ing in 2024 there was a high risk of “un­usual re­gional rain­fall over the pe­riod, with some re­gions ex­pe­ri­enc­ing in­creas­ing drought-re­lated risks and oth­ers in­creased risks as­so­ci­ated with heavy rain­fall”.</p>
    <p>The Arc­tic was also pre­dicted to con­tinue to warm at more than twice the over­all global rate.</p>
    <p>“The find­ings of the re­port are yet again an­other re­minder that while we are busy find­ing ways out of the Covid-19 cri­sis, cli­mate change con­tin­ues to build the foun­da­tion of what will be the big­gest-ever global cri­sis if we don’t do more to mit­i­gate it, and quickly,” said Dr Canadell, who was also one of the re­port’s au­thors.</p>
