    <p>NEW YORK • A year from now, the world will be­gin to gather in Ja­pan to cel­e­brate the open­ing of the Tokyo 2020 Olympics, which were sup­posed to be­gin this week. Or maybe it will not.</p>
    <p>Four months after the In­ter­na­tional Olympic Com­mit­tee (IOC) and of­fi­cials in Ja­pan post­poned the Games amid soar­ing coro­n­avirus in­fec­tion rates and lock­downs across the world, un­cer­tainty pre­vails.</p>
    <p>The un­pre­dictable na­ture of the virus is mak­ing it im­pos­si­ble for of­fi­cials to say defini­tively that the Games will hap­pen or, if they do, what they might look like.</p>
    <p>Maybe there will not be any spec­ta­tors. Maybe only peo­ple liv­ing in Ja­pan will be able to at­tend. Or maybe only those from coun­tries where the virus is un­der con­trol.</p>
    <p>Will there be an Olympic Vil­lage, the tra­di­tional home for the roughly 10,000 com­peti­tors?</p>
    <p>Will ath­letes from the United States, which is the world’s most af­fected coun­try and where the pan­demic shows no signs of abat­ing, be al­lowed to at­tend?</p>
    <p>In a news con­fer­ence last week, Thomas Bach, the pres­i­dent of the IOC, said that plan­ning for the Games now in­volves mul­ti­ple op­tions. All of them, he said, pri­ori­tise the health of the ath­letes.</p>
    <p>He has in­sisted a fur­ther post­pone­ment is not an op­tion; if the Games can­not be held next sum­mer, they will not be held at all.</p>
    <p>As sports leagues ev­ery­where strug­gle to re­turn to some sem­blance of nor­malcy while bal­anc­ing virus out­breaks and safety con­cerns, the chal­lenges of plan­ning a global event that is still a year away have only grown – or merely been ex­ac­er­bated as hot spots for in­fec­tions con­tinue to shift.</p>
    <p>“Peo­ple right now are fo­cused on the health of the cit­i­zens of their coun­tries,” said Har­vey Schiller, the for­mer chief ex­ec­u­tive of the US Olympic and Par­a­lympic Com­mit­tee (USOPC).</p>
    <p>No one doubts the re­solve of the IOC and Ja­panese or­gan­is­ers, who des­per­ately want to hold the Games, given the re­sources they have al­ready com­mit­ted and the money at stake.</p>
    <p>Ja­pan has al­ready spent US$12 bil­lion (S$16.68 bil­lion) to pre­pare for the Games. The IOC stands to lose bil­lions in rev­enue from me­dia rights, tick­ets and spon­sor­ship if the event does not hap­pen.</p>
    <p>De­spite a re­cent spike in coro­n­avirus cases and a ban on travel from 129 coun­tries, the of­fi­cial line in Ja­pan re­mains that the post­poned Tokyo Games will open on</p>
    <p>July 23, 2021. But last week, Tokyo raised its pan­demic alert level to red, its high­est clas­si­fi­ca­tion, in re­sponse to a re­cent spike in cases.</p>
    <p>Polls sug­gest the pub­lic is also wary of the Olympics. In a sur­vey last month by the Asahi Shim­bun paper, 59 per cent of those polled said they wanted the Games to be post­poned again or can­celled.</p>
    <p>The is­sues ex­tend far be­yond Ja­pan’s bor­ders. Tra­di­tion­ally the fi­nan­cial engine of an Olympics, the US cur­rently poses per­haps the big­gest threat to the Games.</p>
    <p>The coro­n­avirus has also forced broad­caster NBC, which has com­mit­ted about US$8 bil­lion for the Amer­i­can me­dia rights to the Games through 2032 and is the IOC’s lead­ing source of rev­enue, to con­sider re­duc­ing its con­tin­gent of roughly 2,000 work­ers and hun­dreds of guests.</p>
    <p>“It’s im­pos­si­ble to pre­dict what the cir­cum­stances will be a year from now,” said Molly Solomon, the ex­ec­u­tive pro­ducer of its Olympics pro­duc­tion.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing a re­cent con­fer­ence call with ath­letes, though, lead­ers of the USOPC had few con­crete an­swers. No one could say if ath­letes would still have to share rooms in the Olympic Vil­lage, if the com­mon din­ing hall would be a po­ten­tially germ-spread­ing buf­fet, or if the Amer­i­can team – tra­di­tion­ally the big­gest con­tin­gent at any Games – might have to be housed sep­a­rately from other na­tions.</p>
    <p>“Ath­letes are yearn­ing for more con­crete com­mu­ni­ca­tion di­rectly from the IOC and other or­gan­i­sa­tions,” said Han Xiao, chair of the USOPC’s Ath­letes’ Ad­vi­sory Coun­cil.</p>
    <p>The US team of over 500 ath­letes might have to be smaller, although so far, the IOC has main­tained it does not plan to re­duce the num­ber of events or par­tic­i­pants.</p>
    <p>“There is a lot of spec­u­la­tion and pro­pos­als, but not one spe­cific plan that any­one is able to fo­cus on,” said Chris­tian Tay­lor, a twotime triple jump gold medal­list.</p>
    <p>Han added that think­ing about travel re­stric­tions was keep­ing ath­letes awake at night. Many need to com­pete to qual­ify for the Games and also to hone their skills for an event that, for many, is the zenith of their ath­letic lives.</p>
    <p>But ath­letes also need as­sur­ances that they will be al­lowed to take part and the coro­n­avirus has changed that equa­tion. “Our ath­letes are used to, ‘You can’t in­fringe upon my right to com­pete’,” Han said. “But this is go­ing to be a real chal­lenge to try to fig­ure out where that line is.”</p>
