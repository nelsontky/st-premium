    <p>In Jan­uary 2015, seven months into his pre­mier­ship, In­dia’s usu­ally sure-footed leader made an un­char­ac­ter­is­tic mis­step when he ap­peared along­side then US Pres­i­dent Barack Obama in an el­e­gant dark suit whose stripes in gold let­ter­ing were em­broi­dered with his own name, Naren­dra Damodar­das Modi.</p>
    <p>Mr Obama was in New Delhi as guest of hon­our at In­dia’s Repub­lic Day, the big­gest pub­lic event in the In­dian na­tional cal­en­dar, when the coun­try shows off its best.</p>
    <p>Mr Modi was not the first leader on the world stage to have tried such a sar­to­rial turn; oth­ers, in­clud­ing Mr Hosni Mubarak of Egypt, have done so dur­ing their time.</p>
    <p>But this is the land of Ma­hatma Gandhi, who fa­mously showed up in Lon­don to dis­cuss In­dian in­de­pen­dence wear­ing no more than a loin­cloth. Be­fore long, news of Mr Modi’s “1 mil­lion ru­pee” suit had be­come the do­mes­tic talk­ing point of the strate­gi­cally sig­nif­i­cant Obama visit.</p>
    <p>Mr Jairam Ramesh, an economist turned prin­ci­pal word­smith of the routed Congress Party, called Mr Modi’s sar­to­rial choice “nar­cis­sis­tic”. He then coined for his po­lit­i­cal masters a phrase that would be­come in­deli­ble in In­dia’s po­lit­i­cal lex­i­con. Mr Modi, he said, runs a “suit-boot ki sarkar” – trans­lated, a gov­ern­ment of the well-heeled.</p>
    <p>The con­tro­ver­sial gar­ment was quickly dis­posed of in auc­tion for 43 times its cost, the pro­ceeds go­ing to a fund raised to cleanse the Ganges River, the wa­ter­way holi­est to In­dia’s ma­jor­ity Hindu pop­u­la­tion. But the “suit-boot ki sarkar” jibe, per­fectly ac­cept­able in the cut and thrust of demo­cratic pol­i­tics, had been unerring in its aim. It would prove costly for In­dia.</p>
    <p>Mr Modi, a 24/7 politi­cian who ar­rived as a pro-in­dus­try re­former re­spon­si­ble for turn­ing Gu­jarat into the “Guang­dong of In­dia”, was thrown off his re­formist stride. He would spend the re­main­der of his first term eras­ing the sug­ges­tion that he was a louche ar­riv­iste ea­ger to live down his child­hood days as a seller of milk tea – the pro­file that had pow­ered him to na­tional lead­er­ship.</p>
    <p>Thereon, he be­came ul­tra-con­scious of main­tain­ing a pro-poor im­age, even chanc­ing a move to can­cel high-value cur­rency notes in the name of curb­ing the “black money” of tax-dodg­ing fat cats, badly dam­ag­ing the cash-de­pen­dent ru­ral econ­omy.</p>
    <p>While In­dia did climb the indices of ease of do­ing busi­ness and a key bank­ruptcy code got passed, most ma­jor re­forms planned for his first term stalled. Free trade agree­ments signed by pre­vi­ous gov­ern­ments and those un­der ne­go­ti­a­tion that would free up the In­dian mar­ket to out­side com­pe­ti­tion be­came es­pe­cially sus­pect. When In­dia an­nounced a last-minute with­drawal from Re­gional Com­pre­hen­sive Eco­nomic Part­ner­ship ne­go­ti­a­tions, Mr Modi cited the im­pact on the poor­est of the In­dian poor and in­voked the “tal­is­man of Gandhi-ji” for his de­ci­sion.</p>
    <p>In­stead, he fo­cused on a range of other is­sues that would help build up po­lit­i­cal cap­i­tal. Di­rect cash trans­fers that avoided spillage from bu­reau­cratic cor­rup­tion were helped by his move to open bank­ing to the poor­est of the land. He put cook­ing gas in homes that pre­vi­ously re­lied on brush­wood and kerosene for kitchen fuel. Un­der­priv­i­leged girls were given free ed­u­ca­tion and text­books, and a cash gift placed in their bank ac­counts at the time of mar­riage.</p>
    <p>All this and the dis­ar­ray in op­po­si­tion ranks helped him win re-elec­tion with an im­proved ma­jor­ity in last year’s na­tional polls, ce­ment­ing his stand­ing across age groups, gen­der and com­mu­ni­ties. Mil­lions of Mus­lim women, many of whom have hus­bands who view Mr Modi’s Hindu ma­jori­tar­ian in­stincts with wari­ness, are thought to have voted for him.</p>
    <p>To­day, de­spite his gov­ern­ment’s ques­tion­able han­dling of Covid-19, a bat­tered econ­omy that had slowed sig­nif­i­cantly even be­fore the coro­n­avirus pan­demic and a dire mil­i­tary sit­u­a­tion on the China bor­der, Mr Modi seems in­vin­ci­ble. In­deed, he has ce­mented his pop­u­lar­ity with the ma­jor­ity</p>
    <p>Hindu com­mu­nity by pre­sid­ing at the con­struc­tion of a mas­sive tem­ple at the pur­ported birth­place of the God-King Rama, on land once dis­puted with Mus­lims.</p>
    <p>Per­haps be­cause of the many is­sues weigh­ing on his mind, Mr Modi has taken on a more brood­ing ex­pres­sion lately. He has also ef­fected a de­lib­er­ate im­age change. The el­e­gant, smartly clipped beard of old has given way to the lush fa­cial hair of a rus­tic sa­vant. The clothes are more som­bre, and a che­quered scarf has of­ten cov­ered his face, worn in the man­ner ru­ral folk do to keep dust away as they move about. The mil­lion-ru­pee closed neck suit has been wiped from pub­lic mem­ory.</p>
    <p>Fi­nally, Mr Modi has once again felt se­cure enough to turn his at­ten­tion to grow­ing the wheez­ing econ­omy. Sig­nif­i­cant ef­fort, some of it al­ready suc­cess­ful, has gone into at­tract­ing man­u­fac­tur­ing in­vest­ments into the coun­try. New labour rules al­low peo­ple to be fired more eas­ily.</p>
    <p>TAK­ING ON THE FARM SEC­TOR</p>
    <p>Mr Modi has now sought to take on the most sen­si­tive of re­forms in a na­tion where two-thirds still live in the coun­try­side: the farm sec­tor.</p>
    <p>Taken to­gether, the se­ries of three Bills that were en­acted change decades-old rules around the sale, pric­ing and stor­age of farm pro­duce – rules that also ex­pose In­dia’s farm­ers to the free mar­ket. Ef­fec­tively, pri­vate buy­ers can now store – or hoard – es­sen­tial com­modi­ties for fu­ture sales, which only gov­ern­ment-au­tho­rised agents ear­lier had the re­mit for.</p>
    <p>Most In­dian farm­ers cur­rently sell the ma­jor­ity of their pro­duce at gov­ern­ment-con­trolled whole­sale mar­kets, or man­dis, at as­sured floor prices called the Min­i­mum Sup­port Price (MSP). One of the big­gest changes is that farm­ers will be al­lowed to sell their pro­duce at a mar­ket price di­rectly to pri­vate play­ers, in­clud­ing su­per­mar­ket chains and on­line gro­cers.</p>
    <p>The new rules ac­tu­ally be­gan as ex­ec­u­tive or­di­nances but once Mr Modi sought to cod­ify them as law by get­ting Par­lia­ment to en­act them, they be­came the sub­ject of na­tion­wide protest, backed most stur­dily by ku­laks and mid­dle­men whose in­comes were threat­ened.</p>
    <p>Farm­ers fear this will end as­sured prices and that big busi­ness will beat them down on price, even though the gov­ern­ment has said the mandi sys­tem and MSP will con­tinue. The protests have been the strong­est in the big farm­ing states of Pun­jab and Haryana, prov­inces that en­joy the bulk of MSP.</p>
    <p>Such re­forms have long been dis­cussed by suc­ces­sive gov­ern­ments and they are needed to cor­rect a se­ries of dis­tor­tions. To­day, frag­mented land hold­ings pre­vent economies of scale and need­lessly raise production costs. The coun­try also fo­cuses too much on grain and not enough on pulses, whose pro­teins are es­sen­tial for phys­i­cal and men­tal growth.</p>
    <p>Pun­jab farm­ers grow rice paddy although theirs is a wheat-grow­ing area and with the gov­ern­ment obliged to of­fer MSP, quite a bit of grain rots in gov­ern­ment ware­houses be­cause of in­ad­e­quate de­mand. Since rice fields re­quire plenty of wa­ter and elec­tric­ity is heav­ily sub­sidised, the ex­ces­sive use of tube­wells and borewells has de­pleted wa­ter ta­bles alarm­ingly.</p>
    <p>Though Mr Modi is from the cot­ton- and peanut-grow­ing state of Gu­jarat, his at­ten­tion has been on is­sues such as these for a while; they fig­ured in his 2013 speech at Delhi Univer­sity that elec­tri­fied In­di­ans and set him­self up as the prime min­is­ter-in-wait­ing.</p>
    <p>With such an in­ef­fi­cient agri­cul­ture model, it is no sur­prise that In­dia is a lag­gard in open­ing its econ­omy to out­side com­pe­ti­tion – fear­ing that coun­tries like Aus­tralia and Canada will swal­low up its mar­ket and leave home pro­duce un­sold. The landed cost in In­dia of Aus­tralian pro­duce is cheaper than grain shipped from north­ern Pun­jab to one of the south­ern In­dian states.</p>
    <p>Nev­er­the­less, the hasty man­ner in which the Bills were rammed through Par­lia­ment, par­tic­u­larly the Up­per House where Mr Modi’s party does not en­joy a ma­jor­ity and where they passed by voice vote, has fu­elled sus­pi­cions of mala fide in ad­di­tion to the real fear among farm­ers that this was a back­door ploy to with­draw MSP and gov­ern­ment pur­chases of grain.</p>
    <p>The re­ver­ber­a­tions are be­ing felt not only in In­dia, where farm­ers have laid siege to the na­tional cap­i­tal, but even in Sin­ga­pore, Aus­tralia, Bri­tain and Canada. Last week, Sin­ga­pore po­lice said they were in­ves­ti­gat­ing protests held in sev­eral lo­ca­tions on the is­land against the farm leg­is­la­tion.</p>
    <p>“For­eign­ers vis­it­ing or liv­ing in Sin­ga­pore should abide by our laws,” said the po­lice. “Those who break the law will be dealt with firmly and this may in­clude ter­mi­na­tion of visa or work passes, where ap­pli­ca­ble.”</p>
    <p>For all the in­del­i­cate­ness dis­played by Mr Modi in push­ing the farm laws, Asia must wish his re­forms suc­cess. In­deed, they could po­ten­tially im­pact In­dia’s growth the way the in­dus­trial re­forms of 1991 did for the na­tion and, in time, give it con­fi­dence to en­gage more fully with the rest of the world, par­tic­u­larly East Asia.</p>
    <p>In­deed, they are an im­per­a­tive for In­dia too. With the de­pen­dency ra­tio set to tilt in 2030 and the steady crum­bling of the joint fam­ily sys­tem as nu­clear fam­i­lies be­come the norm, In­dia will need to spend over­whelm­ingly on so­cial safety nets to pro­tect its aged. This means it needs to wean it­self away from sub­si­dies such as MSP, which, by some es­ti­mates, cost nearly half of budget ex­pen­di­ture. The al­ter­na­tive is ex­tor­tionary tax­a­tion.</p>
    <p>Mr Modi mer­its crit­i­cism for the man­ner in which the Bills were bull­dozed through Par­lia­ment with­out enough ef­fort to build a broad con­sen­sus, un­der­scor­ing his trade­mark im­pa­tience with pro­cesses and a de­sire to run In­dia the way he ran his home state as chief min­is­ter. In­dia is not Gu­jarat.</p>
    <p>Aside from a pro­cliv­ity to­wards hasty im­ple­men­ta­tion of well-in­ten­tioned de­ci­sions, his gov­ern­ment’s other weak­ness is the lack of ef­fec­tive com­mu­ni­ca­tion. This stems from supreme con­fi­dence that he can reach over the heads of the New Delhi-based na­tional me­dia, which he treats with dis­dain, to ad­dress In­dia’s mil­lions through his so­cial me­dia and monthly ra­dio broad­casts. The pres­ence in his in­ner cir­cle of the re­spected geo-economist and ed­i­tor San­jaya Baru as a con­sum­mate me­dia ad­viser was one of the lesser ap­pre­ci­ated facets of Dr Man­mo­han Singh’s widely ap­plauded first term in of­fice. Mr Modi does not have a Baru equiv­a­lent, nor seems to want one.</p>
    <p>In­dia’s Prime Min­is­ter will surely pre­vail in this cri­sis but it has not been with­out cost to him. Aside from the fact that he is faced with his first ma­jor pop­u­lar up­ris­ing, the Akali Dal party of Pun­jab, one of the rul­ing Bharatiya Janata Party’s old­est al­lies, has left his Cab­i­net. Even the staunch­est ally would not wish to get on the wrong side of the pop­u­lar mood in its home base.</p>
    <p>Since he was ap­pointed Gu­jarat’s chief min­is­ter in late 2001, Mr Modi has only known his po­lit­i­cal graph to move in one di­rec­tion – up­wards. While it is too early to call a dip in his for­tunes, the curve cer­tainly is flat­ten­ing. And it may take more than a change of clothes to have it point­ing up­wards once more.</p>
    <p>For all the in­del­i­cate­ness dis­played by Mr Modi in push­ing the farm laws, Asia must wish his re­forms suc­cess. In­deed, they could po­ten­tially im­pact In­dia’s growth the way the in­dus­trial re­forms of 1991 did for the na­tion and, in time, give it con­fi­dence to en­gage more fully with the rest of the world, par­tic­u­larly East Asia.</p>
