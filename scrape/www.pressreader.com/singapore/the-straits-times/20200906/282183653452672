    <p>•</p>
    <p>Chelsea have emerged as dark horses to win the English Premier League ti­tle next sea­son, af­ter tak­ing their sum­mer spend­ing spree to nearly £200 mil­lion (S$362 mil­lion) with the sign­ing of Ger­man in­ter­na­tional Kai Havertz from Bayer Lev­erkusen on a fiveyear deal on Fri­day.</p>
    <p>His ar­rival at Stam­ford Bridge for a re­ported £71 mil­lion – which could rise with add-ons – is the Blues’ lat­est state­ment of in­tent as they seek to cut the gap on Liver­pool and Manch­ester City at the top of the Premier League.</p>
    <p>The west London club fin­ished fourth in the Premier League last sea­son, 33 points be­hind cham­pi­ons Liver­pool, but are now the book­mak­ers’ third favourites to win the top-flight ti­tle.</p>
    <p>“I want to have big suc­cess and we want to win ti­tles here,” the 21-year-old Havertz said.</p>
    <p>“Chelsea is al­ways a big club and they want to win ti­tles and I try to do my best, so we can achieve these things.”</p>
    <p>The ver­sa­tile mid­fielder will pro­vide man­ager Frank Lam­pard with many op­tions.</p>
    <p>He is ex­pected to play in the No. 10 role in a 4-2-3-1 or the ad­vanced No. 8 in a 4-3-3. He can also play up front.</p>
    <p>He joins in­ter­na­tional team­mate Timo Werner, Hakim Ziyech, Ben Chilwell and Thi­ago Silva in join­ing the club for Lam­pard’s sec­ond sea­son in charge.</p>
    <p>The likes of Ziyech are set to ben­e­fit from play­ing with Havertz, with for­mer Bayer Lev­erkusen head coach Tay­fun Korkut prais­ing his in­tel­li­gence.</p>
    <p>“Watch his as­sists and you can see it,” he said of Ger­many’s most ex­pen­sive foot­baller, ranked among the top three play­ers in the Bun­desliga last sea­son for short passes lead­ing to a chance for a team­mate.</p>
    <p>“What is fan­tas­tic about him is that he waits un­til the last sec­ond be­fore mak­ing the de­ci­sion... He al­ways makes the right de­ci­sion.”</p>
    <p>For­mer Manch­ester United and Bay­ern Mu­nich mid­fielder Owen Har­g­reaves de­scribed Havertz as “a hybrid of Michael Bal­lack and Me­sut Ozil”.</p>
    <p>“That says a lot in terms of his goals and ele­gance,” he added. “He is a su­per player.”</p>
    <p>Havertz scored 46 goals, in­clud­ing 18 last sea­son, and pro­vided 31 as­sists in 150 com­pet­i­tive games for Lev­erkusen. But that was not enough to lead them back into the Cham­pi­ons League as they fin­ished fifth in the Bun­desliga and went out in the quar­ter-fi­nals of the Europa League to In­ter Mi­lan.</p>
    <p>He was keen to make the move to a Cham­pi­ons League club and Chelsea could not pass up the op­por­tu­nity to sign one of Europe’s hottest prospects, de­spite more press­ing con­cerns at the other end of the field.</p>
    <p>Some pun­dits be­lieve the Blues are one more sign­ing away from be­ing se­ri­ous ti­tle con­tenders.</p>
    <p>Havertz is the club’s sec­ond most ex­pen­sive sign­ing af­ter Kepa Ar­riz­a­bal­aga joined from Ath­letic Bil­bao (£71.6 mil­lion) in 2018.</p>
    <p>But a new No. 1 – in the form of Rennes goal­keeper Edouard Mendy – could be the fi­nal puz­zle af­ter Ar­riz­a­bal­aga failed to live up to ex­pec­ta­tions in goal.</p>
    <p>ESPN foot­ball ex­pert Julien Lau­rens told Sky Sport’s Trans­fer Talk pod­cast: “Third is an ab­so­lute ne­ces­sity be­cause any­thing below that is a dis­ap­point­ment with this squad.</p>
    <p>“They prob­a­bly should add a goal­keeper some­where so if they do that, it’s even bet­ter.”</p>
