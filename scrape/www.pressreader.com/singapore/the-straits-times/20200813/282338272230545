    <p>LON­DON • The row over Rac­ing Point’s For­mula One car was head­ing for court af­ter ri­vals Fer­rari and Re­nault con­firmed on Tues­day they would ap­peal against a stew­ards’ de­ci­sion.</p>
    <p>Sil­ver­stone-based Rac­ing Point were fined €400,000 (S$646,200) and docked 15 points in the con­struc­tors’ championsh­ip, af­ter stew­ards up­held a Re­nault protest and ruled that the team had not de­signed their own brake ducts.</p>
    <p>The car is a visual copy of last year’s Mercedes, who pro­vide the en­gines and gear­box, and the ar­gu­ment is about the essence of be­ing a con­struc­tor and how much of the car has to be de­signed in-house.</p>
    <p>The team were al­lowed to con­tinue rac­ing the car, how­ever, with stew­ards not­ing that the breach was of sport­ing reg­u­la­tions rather than non-com­pli­ance with tech­ni­cal rules.</p>
    <p>Some ri­val teams want a tougher pun­ish­ment im­posed on Rac­ing Point, who are al­ready back ahead of Re­nault de­spite the points de­duc­tion af­ter last week­end’s 70th An­niver­sary Grand Prix at Sil­ver­stone.</p>
    <p>Fer­rari and Re­nault were among five teams, in­clud­ing Rac­ing Point who say they have done noth­ing wrong, who no­ti­fied the gov­ern­ing FIA last Sun­day of their in­ten­tion to go to the In­ter­na­tional Court of Ap­peal.</p>
    <p>McLaren said in a state­ment on Tues­day that they had dropped out, but noted that the FIA would have to clar­ify the sport­ing and tech­ni­cal reg­u­la­tions.</p>
    <p>They added that this would “pro­tect For­mula One as a sport where teams are clearly de­fined as con­struc­tors, and re­moves the po­ten­tial that the For­mula One World Championsh­ip in­cludes cars that are, in ef­fect, copies of other com­peti­tors”.</p>
    <p>“McLaren Rac­ing re­spects the de­ci­sions of Fer­rari and Re­nault to pur­sue their ap­peals and will fol­low pro­ceed­ings with in­ter­est,” the team added.</p>
    <p>For­mer cham­pi­ons Wil­liams joined McLaren yes­ter­day in drop­ping plans to lodge an ap­peal.</p>
    <p>“Af­ter careful con­sid­er­a­tion, Wil­liams have elected not to pro­ceed with the for­mal ap­peal,” the Mercedes-pow­ered team said in a state­ment.</p>
    <p>“We be­lieve the FIA’s de­ci­sion to seek the pro­hi­bi­tion of ex­ten­sive car copy­ing for 2021 on­wards ad­dresses our most fun­da­men­tal con­cern and re­asserts the role and re­spon­si­bil­ity of a con­struc­tor within the sport.”</p>
