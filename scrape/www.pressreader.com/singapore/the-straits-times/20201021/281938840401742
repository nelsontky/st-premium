    <p>WASHINGTON • United States Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump has slammed Dr An­thony Fauci as “a dis­as­ter”, say­ing, de­spite signs that the na­tion was headed to­wards an­other coro­n­avirus peak, that peo­ple were “tired” of hear­ing about the virus from “th­ese id­iots” in the gov­ern­ment.</p>
    <p>The broad­side, dur­ing a con­fer­ence call with cam­paign staff on Mon­day, just two weeks be­fore elec­tion day, was hardly the clos­ing mes­sage Mr Trump’s ad­vis­ers were look­ing for.</p>
    <p>It threat­ened to fo­cus the elec­torate squarely on the Pres­i­dent’s coro­n­avirus re­sponse and pit­ted him against Dr Fauci, who, as the na­tion’s top in­fec­tious disease ex­pert, is a ca­reer gov­ern­ment sci­en­tist the pub­lic likes and trusts far more than Mr Trump.</p>
    <p>Dr Fauci has been sep­a­rat­ing him­self from the White House and warn­ing Amer­i­cans to “hun­ker down” and brace them­selves for a dif­fi­cult win­ter – a mes­sage at odds with Mr Trump’s re­peated as­sur­ances that the na­tion is “round­ing the cor­ner” on a pan­demic that has claimed about 220,000 Amer­i­can lives.</p>
    <p>“Peo­ple are tired of Covid,” Mr Trump com­plained on the call, which sev­eral re­porters were in­vited into. “I have the big­gest ral­lies I’ve ever had. And we have Covid. Peo­ple are say­ing: ‘What­ever. Just leave us alone.’ They’re tired of it.”</p>
    <p>He added: “Peo­ple are tired of hear­ing Fauci and th­ese id­iots, all th­ese id­iots who got it wrong.”</p>
    <p>Dr Fauci’s cau­tion­ary words are borne out by the num­bers. More than 70,450 new coro­n­avirus cases were re­ported in the United States last Fri­day, the high­est fig­ure since July 24, ac­cord­ing to a New York</p>
    <p>Times data­base. More than 900 new deaths were recorded. And over the past week, there have been an av­er­age of 56,615 cases per day, an in­crease of 30 per cent from the av­er­age two weeks ear­lier.</p>
    <p>In a ra­dio in­ter­view on Mon­day night, Dr Fauci dis­missed the Pres­i­dent’s com­ments as a dis­trac­tion, re­fer­ring to a well-known book about the Mafia. “That other stuff, it’s like in The God­fa­ther: Noth­ing per­sonal, strictly busi­ness. As far as I’m con­cerned, I just want to do my job and take care of the peo­ple of this coun­try,” he told South­ern Cal­i­for­nia ra­dio sta­tion KNX1070.</p>
    <p>Be­yond push­ing for a vac­cine, the Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion has re­frained from con­fronting the threat ag­gres­sively, push­ing in­stead to fully open the econ­omy and get chil­dren back in school.</p>
    <p>The White House coro­n­avirus task force, which met daily at the out­set of the pan­demic, now meets about once a week. “The ad­min­is­tra­tion’s coro­n­avirus strat­egy is fun­da­men­tally rooted in the bedrock ob­jec­tive of sav­ing lives and help­ing our coun­try safely open and stay open,” said Mr Michael Bars, a White House spokesman.</p>
    <p>“As al­ways, coro­n­avirus-re­lated mat­ters re­ceive ap­pro­pri­ate at­ten­tion, con­sul­ta­tion and in­put from task force ex­perts.”</p>
