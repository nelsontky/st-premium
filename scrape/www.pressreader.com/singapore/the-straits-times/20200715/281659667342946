    <p>Swiss in­vest­ment bank UBS has marked its 50th an­niver­sary in Sin­ga­pore with a $500,000 do­na­tion to The Straits Times School Pocket Money Fund (STSPMF), to help chil­dren from low-in­come fam­i­lies with their school­ing needs.</p>
    <p>UBS Asia-Pa­cific pres­i­dent Ed­mund Koh has also made a per­sonal do­na­tion of $500,000 to the same fund, said the bank yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>UBS Sin­ga­pore staff also con­trib­uted to a Giv­ing.sg fund-rais­ing cam­paign for STSPMF, which was matched by the bank, bring­ing the sum to $51,985.</p>
    <p>The do­na­tions to STSPMF come ahead of ChildAid 2020, which is or­gan­ised by The Straits Times and The Busi­ness Times. The an­nual con­cert, in its 16th edi­tion, will be held on­line to­day from 8pm.</p>
    <p>The show, which prom­ises a cut­ting-edge, 360-de­gree im­mer­sive video ex­pe­ri­ence this round, ben­e­fits STSPMF and The Busi­ness Times Bud­ding Artists Fund.</p>
    <p>The lat­ter fund sup­ports lessons in the per­form­ing and vis­ual arts for fi­nan­cially dis­ad­van­taged chil­dren who are ar­tis­ti­cally tal­ented.</p>
    <p>“We hope more peo­ple will tune in to this first-ever vir­tual ChildAid con­cert and gen­er­ously do­nate to this mean­ing­ful cause to help ful­fil the as­pi­ra­tions of our fu­ture gen­er­a­tion in Sin­ga­pore,” said UBS’ Mr Koh.</p>
    <p>Mr Au­gust Hate­cke, UBS Sin­ga­pore coun­try head, added: “As we po­si­tion UBS for the new nor­mal, we also saw a need to ex­pand our so­cial sup­port to the wider com­mu­nity.</p>
    <p>“By help­ing one an­other and standing to­gether in sol­i­dar­ity, we will be able to over­come this cri­sis and emerge stronger and more united.”</p>
    <p>This year’s ChildAid con­cert will mark two key mile­stones – The Straits Times’ 175th an­niver­sary and STSPMF’s 20th an­niver­sary.</p>
    <p>STSPMF was started on Chil­dren’s Day in 2000 with the aim of help­ing chil­dren from low-in­come fam­i­lies who were at­tend­ing school with­out proper break­fast or pocket money to sus­tain their day.</p>
    <p>To en­sure that no child went hun­gry dur­ing the month-long school hol­i­days – which were brought for­ward dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker pe­riod to start on May 5 – the fund pledged up to $2 mil­lion for meal sub­si­dies, with the Min­istry of Ed­u­ca­tion match­ing every dol­lar distribute­d.</p>
    <p>More than 47,000 pri­mary and sec­ondary school stu­dents from low-in­come fam­i­lies ben­e­fited from this ini­tia­tive.</p>
    <p>Since its in­cep­tion, the fund has helped close to 180,000 chil­dren and young peo­ple in need and dis­bursed more than $75 mil­lion. The fund dis­burses about $6 mil­lion yearly, which helps around 10,000 needy stu­dents.</p>
