    <p>01-08 Have­lock Cooked Food Cen­tre, 22A/22B Have­lock Road Open: Mon­days to Satur­days, 8am to 3pm, closed on Sun­days Price: $3, $4 and $5</p>
    <p>You can eas­ily miss this mod­est stall, if not for the short queue of cus­tomers milling about most days. There are no news­pa­per re­view cut-outs or award cer­tifi­cates at the front.</p>
    <p>The bowl of laksa dished out by the el­derly stallholde­r does not look ap­peal­ing ei­ther, with al­most ev­ery­thing buried un­der a heap of thick rice noo­dles, ex­cept for half a hard-boiled egg and a dol­lop of sam­bal and some</p>
    <p>Five out­lets, in­clud­ing at 01-59 Queensway</p>
    <p>Shop­ping Cen­tre, 1 Queensway</p>
    <p>Open: 10am to 9pm daily Price: $4.50, $5.50 and $6.50</p>
    <p>Janggut is an in­sti­tu­tion that has been around since the 1950s, of­ten ac­knowl­edged as the old­est laksa in Ka­tong. It still has an out­let in Roxy Square in East Coast.</p>
    <p>Its trade­mark is a smear of sam­bal on the side of the bowl, which you can stir into the broth for more flavour and heat.</p>
    <p>Typ­i­cal of Ka­tong laksa, the rice noo­dles are cut into chopped-up laksa leaves.</p>
    <p>But once I dig in, the ac­com­pa­ni­ments come to light. The cock­les are tiny but not over­cooked, so they stay juicy. The fish­cake is thought­fully cut into strips to re­sem­ble strands of bee­hoon.</p>
    <p>And I like their smooth tex­ture.</p>
    <p>The pieces of taupok are a lit­tle hard, though. They need to sim­mer longer in the pot to bet­ter ab­sorb the gravy, which is mod­er­ately spicy and de­li­cious. Drink up. short pieces and the dish is eaten with a spoon so you taste ev­ery­thing in one mouth­ful.</p>
    <p>There is no taupok, but you get strips of fish­cake and sliced prawns. I wish there were more and big­ger cock­les in my bowl, though, as some of those I get are tiny and over­cooked.</p>
