    <p>Two deputy pub­lic pros­e­cu­tors (DPPs) who are fac­ing a mis­con­duct com­plaint by for­mer do­mes­tic helper Parti Liyani have each en­gaged se­nior coun­sel to rep­re­sent them in dis­ci­plinary pro­ceed­ings.</p>
    <p>An At­tor­ney-Gen­eral’s Cham­bers (AGC) spokesman, in re­sponse to queries from The Straits Times, said on Thurs­day that Ms Tan Yany­ing has en­gaged Se­nior Coun­sel Davin­der Singh from Davin­der Singh Cham­bers, while Mr Tan Wee Hao’s lawyer is Se­nior Coun­sel Ja­son Chan from Allen & Gled­hill.</p>
    <p>Their ap­point­ments fol­low Chief Jus­tice Sun­daresh Menon giv­ing the go-ahead in Oc­to­ber for dis­ci­plinary in­ves­ti­ga­tions to start into the way the two DPPs had han­dled Ms Parti’s theft trial.</p>
    <p>She had been ac­cused of steal­ing $34,000 worth of items from her for­mer em­ployer Liew Mun Leong, a prom­i­nent busi­ness­man, who re­signed as chair­man of Changi Air­port Group among other po­si­tions fol­low­ing pub­lic out­cry af­ter Ms Parti was ac­quit­ted on ap­peal.</p>
    <p>The two-mem­ber dis­ci­plinary tri­bunal is ap­pointed by the Chief Jus­tice and the hear­ings are ex­pected to start next year.</p>
    <p>Lawyers Peter Low and Choo Zheng Xi are rep­re­sent­ing Ms Parti in the dis­ci­plinary pro­ceed­ings, at which her lawyer in the crim­i­nal trial, Mr Anil Balchan­dani, could be a wit­ness.</p>
    <p>In the crim­i­nal trial that ended in the State Courts last year, Ms Parti, now 46, had been charged with steal­ing, among other things, a Pi­o­neer DVD player.</p>
    <p>On ap­peal, the High Court ear­lier this year found the DVD player to be faulty. This, plus other doubts raised about the pros­e­cu­tion case, led to her be­ing ac­quit­ted of all charges in the High Court.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing the dis­trict court trial, the DPPs had shown Ms Parti that the DVD player could play a video dig­i­tally stored in the hard disk. But at the ap­peal, it was shown that the de­vice could not play DVDs.</p>
    <p>In his de­ci­sion grounds is­sued in Oc­to­ber al­low­ing the ap­pli­ca­tion for the probe to pro­ceed, the Chief Jus­tice said he was “sat­is­fied there is a prima fa­cie case that the DPPs’ con­duct might sug­gest a lack of can­dour and this may have re­sulted in the ap­pli­cant be­ing cross ex­am­ined un­fairly, and in the ap­pli­cant and the court be­ing mis­led”.</p>
    <p>The Chief Jus­tice had found that the DPPs had rea­son to think there were is­sues with the DVD player’s func­tion­al­ity and this was not made known to the trial judge, Ms Parti or her lawyer, Mr Balchan­dani.</p>
    <p>He also made clear that, in grant­ing leave to in­ves­ti­gate the DPPs, he had not re­garded any de­fences the DPPs may raise and had not con­sid­ered any spe­cific ex­pla­na­tion the DPPs may have that could ex­plain their con­duct and even ex­cul­pate them.</p>
    <p>The AGC spokesman, in ex­plain­ing why the DPPs are rep­re­sented by lawyers from the Bar in the pend­ing probe and not coun­sel from the AGC, said the Le­gal Pro­fes­sion (Dis­ci­plinary Tri­bunal) Rules gov­ern­ing the dis­ci­plinary tri­bunal pro­ceed­ings do not al­low state coun­sel to rep­re­sent the DPPs.</p>
    <p>It is un­der­stood that un­der S7(1) of the rules, the re­spon­dent be­fore the tri­bunal may be rep­re­sented by a so­lic­i­tor. State coun­sel are le­gal ser­vice of­fi­cers and not so­lic­i­tors, based on the Le­gal Pro­fes­sion Act.</p>
    <p>The spokesman added: “Chief Jus­tice Sun­daresh Menon had al­lowed state coun­sel to be present at court pro­ceed­ings for the leave stage to ren­der any as­sis­tance to the court where ap­pro­pri­ate, and to en­able the DPPs to un­der­stand the com­plaint that was be­ing made against them.”</p>
