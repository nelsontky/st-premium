    <p>The hum­ble recorder takes pride of place in artist Song-Ming Ang’s whim­si­cal Venice Bi­en­nale ex­hi­bi­tion. The show was first pre­sented at the pres­ti­gious in­ter­na­tional arts fes­ti­val last year and can now be viewed at the Na­tional Mu­seum of Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>Cu­rated by Michelle Ho, it ex­plores no­tions of am­a­teurism and agency and al­ludes to a se­ries of con­certs by Sin­ga­pore’s then-Min­istry of Cul­ture, which ran in the 1970s and 1980s.</p>
    <p>The an­chor piece, Recorder Re­write (right), is a three-chan­nel film fea­tur­ing pri­mary school pupils play­ing mu­sic of their own mak­ing on recorders in dif­fer­ent parts of the Sin­ga­pore Con­fer­ence Hall.</p>
    <p>The show in Sin­ga­pore, which also fea­tures fab­ric ban­ners, mu­sic manuscript­s and recorder sculp­tures, has three additional phys­i­cal works which are be­ing shown to­gether for the first time.</p>
    <p>One of them is You And I (2012 – 2018), fea­tur­ing a playlist and hand­writ­ten let­ters Ang had re­ceived from friends, col­leagues and strangers be­tween 2009 and 2018. Dur­ing this pe­riod, he in­vited peo­ple to send him a let­ter and, in re­turn, he mailed them a per­son­alised mix­tape CD.</p>
    <p>Other events in­clude ex­hi­bi­tion tours as well as a per­for­ma­tive lec­ture by Ang.</p>
    <p>He says: “This is an ex­hi­bi­tion that is truly col­lab­o­ra­tive in spirit and ex­ten­sive in scope, and we have ex­panded the pre­sen­ta­tion to in­clude even more el­e­ments of na­tional his­tory as well as my own artis­tic out­put through­out the years.” WHERE: Ex­hi­bi­tion Gallery,</p>
