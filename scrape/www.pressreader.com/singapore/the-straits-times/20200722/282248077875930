    <p>LON­DON • Wolves have proven last sea­son was no fluke and af­ter sur­pass­ing their tally last term by two points, Nuno Espir­ito Santo be­lieves it is a sign of progress.</p>
    <p>Their first sea­son back in the Premier League last term af­ter a sixyear ab­sence saw them fin­ish sev­enth on 57 points, qual­i­fy­ing for the Europa League in the process.</p>
    <p>Speak­ing af­ter their 2-0 home vic­tory over Crys­tal Palace on Mon­day, Nuno said: “The words of build­ing and im­prov­ing make sense.</p>
    <p>“To­day we made two more points than last sea­son, so we are im­prov­ing and I’m happy for that. A lot of credit to the play­ers in such a com­pli­cated sea­son, with all the is­sues that hap­pened.</p>
    <p>“The be­lief of the play­ers is in­cred­i­ble. We have a lot of things to go. A tough game (at Chelsea) on Sun­day, fin­ish the Premier League, and then fo­cus on what’s com­ing af­ter.”</p>
    <p>The Por­tuguese man­ager has ev­ery rea­son to be op­ti­mistic. Wolves are a point ahead of Spurs, who are in sev­enth. Eighth-placed Sh­effield United, who lost 1-0 to Ever­ton on Mon­day to re­main on 54 points, can no longer catch them with one league game re­main­ing.</p>
    <p>Should they se­cure sixth in the league, it will guar­an­tee Euro­pean foot­ball for the sec­ond year run­ning. Hav­ing achieved their best league tally since the 1979-80 cam­paign, mid­fielder Joao Moutinho feels that it puts them in good stead when the Europa League restarts next month.</p>
    <p>Their last-16 tie with Olympiakos is poised at 1-1 ahead of the Aug 6 sec­ond leg at Mo­lineux and the Portugal in­ter­na­tional “wants to con­tinue to have these (pos­i­tive) re­sults”.</p>
    <p>Asked how Wolves have avoided a sec­ond sea­son slump, he said: “The se­cret is work­ing hard, putting 100 per cent into train­ing and it’s work­ing well. The staff do all they can to help our con­di­tion and we do a great job on the pitch and out­side.”</p>
