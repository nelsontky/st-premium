    <p>I am heart­ened that Sin­ga­pore will be plant­ing one mil­lion trees over the next 10 years (In­ten­si­fy­ing green drive and get­ting Sin­ga­pore­ans to be stew­ards of na­ture, Sept 14).</p>
    <p>I hope, how­ever, that we mea­sure the net in­crease in the num­ber of trees over this same pe­riod. For ex­am­ple, if we cut down 500,000 trees over the next 10 years and plant a mil­lion, our net in­crease would be only half a mil­lion trees.</p>
    <p>It would be worse if we cut more trees than we plant as we will in fact be de­plet­ing our green cover.</p>
    <p>What we need to be dis­cussing is not the num­ber of trees that will be planted, but the in­crease in our green cover.</p>
    <p>As we prune trees along ma­jor roads such as Or­chard Road, I have no­ticed how much more con­crete is now vis­i­ble com­pared with a cou­ple of years ago when the roads were shaded in gor­geous hues of green.</p>
    <p>Re­cently, I was heart­bro­ken to see the en­tire sec­tion of the Kam­pong Trail be­tween MacRitchie Reser­voir and Bukit Timah Na­ture Re­serve boarded up.</p>
    <p>It would be un­for­tu­nate if old trees are be­ing razed to the ground to make way for a gar­den when pre­serv­ing them in all their nat­u­ral glory would be the best gift we could give our­selves.</p>
    <p>I felt the same sense of dis­ap­point­ment when I en­tered the new Botanic Gar­dens Gal­lop Ex­ten­sion.</p>
    <p>That side of Ty­er­sall Road used to be lush for­est and it must have cost mil­lions of dol­lars to cut down trees and build the new ex­ten­sion.</p>
    <p>I have read about the virtues of the ar­bore­tum, but I am not con­vinced that cut­ting down ex­ist­ing fully grown trees to build a new “li­brary of trees” makes sense.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore is blessed with rain­forests in the city. Per­haps we should find a way to pre­serve what is left of these rain­forests rather than re­model them into more man­i­cured “gar­dens”, which are more ar­ti­fi­cial in ap­pear­ance and not uniquely Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>It would be won­der­ful if the Na­tional Parks Board could in­vite con­cerned mem­bers of the pub­lic to con­sul­ta­tion ses­sions for feed­back pe­ri­od­i­cally when there are plans to cut down sec­tions of green ar­eas.</p>
