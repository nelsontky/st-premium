    <p>Coun­tries which have been rel­a­tively suc­cess­ful in tam­ing the coro­n­avirus have, as early as May, sought to es­tab­lish travel bub­bles or air bridges with other na­tions. Th­ese travel bub­bles let res­i­dents in coun­tries which have low in­fec­tion rates travel between them with­out hav­ing to un­dergo strict on-ar­rival quar­an­tine. Here are some of the agree­ments:</p>
    <p>BALTIC BUB­BLE</p>
    <p>Lithua­nia, Latvia and Es­to­nia were the first in the world to cre­ate a travel bub­ble with one an­other on May 15. Ci­ti­zens and res­i­dents can travel freely between th­ese coun­tries, but any­body en­ter­ing from out­side would have to self-iso­late for 14 days. As of yes­ter­day, Lithua­nia has 1,947 to­tal cases; Latvia, 1,192 and Es­to­nia, 2,021.</p>
    <p>EURO­PEAN UNION</p>
    <p>Since the end of last month, Bel­gium, Ger­many, Italy, Spain and Switzer­land have fully opened their bor­ders to tourists from the Euro­pean Union, Bri­tain and the Schen­gen Area. On June 30, the Euro­pean Com­mis­sion lifted the travel ban on 15 coun­tries out­side the bloc, such as Canada, Ja­pan, South Korea and China.</p>
    <p>But a resur­gence in virus cases around the world has forced many Euro­pean coun­tries to re-eval­u­ate on their own who to open their bor­ders to.</p>
    <p>IN­DIA</p>
    <p>In­dia last week ex­panded bi­lat­eral bub­bles with France, Ger­many and the United States. The lim­ited ar­range­ment al­lows se­lect air­lines to op­er­ate a fixed num­ber of flights each week from last Fri­day to Aug 1. Ne­go­ti­a­tions for a sim­i­lar ar­range­ment with Bri­tain are said to be at an ad­vanced stage.</p>
    <p>This month, In­dia estab­lished a lim­ited air bub­ble with the United Arab Emi­rates, un­der which char­ter flights op­er­ated by UAE car­ri­ers would fly In­dian ci­ti­zens back to In­dia from the Gulf state and bring UAE res­i­dents to the Gulf state between July 12 and 26. In­ter­na­tional pas­sen­ger flights have been sus­pended in In­dia since March 23.</p>
    <p>CHINA-SOUTH KOREA COR­RI­DOR</p>
    <p>China and South Korea opened a tightly con­trolled air cor­ri­dor between se­lected cities in the two coun­tries, in­clud­ing Shang­hai and Seoul. Trav­ellers are re­quired to un­dergo a two-day quar­an­tine and then a blood test upon ar­rival in China. They also have to un­dergo a coro­n­avirus test be­fore fly­ing.</p>
    <p>There have been dis­cus­sions to rope in Hong Kong and Ma­cau.</p>
    <p>TRANS-TAS­MAN BUB­BLE</p>
    <p>As early as March, Aus­tralia and New Zealand floated the idea of a Trans-Tas­man travel bub­ble between the two Aus­trala­sia coun­tries. But lead­ers from both coun­tries have yet to reach an agree­ment as ne­go­ti­a­tions have been set back by a sec­ond wave of out­break in Aus­tralia’s Vic­to­ria state.</p>
    <p>Other travel bub­bles be­ing con­sid­ered in the re­gion in­clude Tai­wan-South Korea, In­done­sia with China, South Korea, Ja­pan and Aus­tralia, and Thai­land-Hong Kong.</p>
