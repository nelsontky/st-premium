    <p>de­vel­oped and they are ex­pected to be com­pleted be­tween Au­gust and Septem­ber.</p>
    <p>Like con­ven­tional ven­ti­la­tors, SG-In­spire is able to fa­cil­i­tate res­pi­ra­tory sup­port for pa­tients us­ing both in­va­sive and non-in­va­sive ven­ti­la­tion meth­ods, through in­tu­ba­tion or a mask in­ter­face, de­pend­ing on their needs.</p>
    <p>The ven­ti­la­tor is de­signed to be eas­ily de­ploy­able as it uses am­bi­ent air to as­sist with breath­ing sup­port, as op­posed to high-pres­sure med­i­cal gas which is typ­i­cally re­quired for con­ven­tional ven­ti­la­tors.</p>
    <p>This would be po­ten­tially use­ful in sit­u­a­tions where health­care re­sources are lim­ited, or high-pres­sure med­i­cal gas is in short sup­ply.</p>
    <p>Pa­tients suf­fer­ing from milder lung in­jury or those be­ing weaned</p>
    <p>Global an­tic­i­pa­tion for a Covid-19 vac­cine has height­ened in the light of promis­ing find­ings from early-stage hu­man tri­als.</p>
    <p>And while ex­perts say more stud­ies are needed and that a com­mer­cially avail­able vac­cine could still be more than a year away, na­tions around the world are look­ing to se­cure suf­fi­cient doses to in­oc­u­late their pop­u­la­tions ahead of time.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore is one of 75 na­tions in a mul­ti­lat­eral ini­tia­tive that will en­sure the Repub­lic gets ac­cess to vac­cine doses.</p>
    <p>A spokesman for the Health Min­istry told The Sun­day Times that Sin­ga­pore was among the first coun­tries to sub­mit an ex­pres­sion of in­ter­est to join the Covid-19 Vac­cine Global Ac­cess (Covax) Fa­cil­ity on June 25.</p>
    <p>The Covax fi­nanc­ing scheme will enable fast and eq­ui­table ac­cess to Covid-19 vac­cines for the 75 coun­tries, as well as 90 poorer coun­tries sup­ported un­der this scheme. It is co-led by Gavi, the Vac­cine Al­liance; the World Health Or­gan­i­sa­tion (WHO); and the Coali­tion for Epi­demic Pre­pared­ness In­no­va­tions.</p>
    <p>Work­ing with multi­na­tional and de­vel­op­ing coun­try vac­cine man­u­fac­tur­ers, the Covax Fa­cil­ity aims to de­liver two bil­lion doses of safe, ef­fec­tive vac­cines that have passed reg­u­la­tory ap­proval and/or WHO pre-qual­i­fi­ca­tion by the end of next year.</p>
    <p>“These vac­cines will be de­liv­ered equally to all par­tic­i­pat­ing coun­tries, pro­por­tional to their pop­u­la­tions, ini­tially pri­ori­tis­ing health­care work­ers then ex­pand­ing to cover 20 per cent of the pop­u­la­tion of par­tic­i­pat­ing coun­tries,” said the WHO.</p>
    <p>The Covax Fa­cil­ity also in­cludes an ad­di­tional mech­a­nism called the Covax Ad­vance Mar­ket Com­mit­ment (AMC) which aims to in­cen­tivise vac­cine man­u­fac­tur­ers to pro­duce suf­fi­cient quan­ti­ties of even­tual Covid-19 vac­cines, and to en­sure ac­cess for de­vel­op­ing coun­tries.</p>
    <p>The WHO said the 75 coun­tries which have sub­mit­ted ex­pres­sions of in­ter­est to join the Covax Fa­cil­ity would fi­nance the vac­cines from their own pub­lic fi­nance bud­gets. “(They) part­ner with up to 90 lower-in­come coun­tries that could be sup­ported through vol­un­tary do­na­tions to the AMC,” added the global health body.</p>
    <p>To­gether, the 165 coun­tries re­poff breath­ing sup­port can be placed on these ven­ti­la­tors, free­ing up con­ven­tional ven­ti­la­tors to be de­ployed for more se­vere cases of Covid-19.</p>
    <p>“Higher pres­sures and dif­fer­ent set­tings that are avail­able on con­ven­tional ven­ti­la­tors are not aimed to be repli­cated on SG-In­spire, as adding more set­tings and per­for­mance char­ac­ter­is­tics makes the re­sent more than 60 per cent of the world’s pop­u­la­tion, WHO said.</p>
    <p>The AMC aims to raise US$2 bil­lion (S$2.8 bil­lion) – enough for Gavi-sup­ported coun­tries to im­mu­nise health­care work­ers as well as high-risk in­di­vid­u­als, and cre­ate a flex­i­ble buf­fer of doses to be de­ployed where needed most.</p>
    <p>The Covax Fa­cil­ity is part of a broader WHO ini­tia­tive aimed at fos­ter­ing global col­lab­o­ra­tion to ac­cel­er­ate de­vel­op­ment, pro­duc­tion and eq­ui­table ac­cess to Covid-19 di­ag­nos­tics, ther­a­peu­tics and vac­cines.</p>
    <p>There are 25 can­di­date vac­cines around the world that are cur­rently un­der­go­ing clin­i­cal eval­u­a­tion – in­clud­ing one co-de­vel­oped by re­searchers from Duke-NUS Med­i­cal School in Sin­ga­pore – with 141 more at the pre-clin­i­cal phase.</p>
    <p>In a Skype in­ter­view with The Sun­day Times, Dr Jerome Kim, the di­rec­tor-gen­eral of the In­ter­na­tional Vac­cine In­sti­tute, said it was in­evitable that vac­cine na­tion­al­ism will oc­cur.</p>
    <p>The non-profit in­sti­tute, which cham­pi­ons vac­ci­na­tion for global health, was ini­ti­ated by the United Na­tions De­vel­op­ment Pro­gramme and es­tab­lished in 1997.</p>
    <p>There are coun­tries that are in­vest­ing in vac­cine de­vel­op­ment, Dr Kim noted, and they may have an ex­pec­ta­tion of rec­i­proc­ity.</p>
    <p>He cited the United States’ Op­er­a­tion Warp Speed ini­tia­tive to ac­cel­er­ate the de­vel­op­ment of a vac­cine. The fed­eral gov­ern­ment has poured US$10 bil­lion into the ini­tia­tive.</p>
    <p>“The coun­tries that are pay­ing to de­velop these vac­cines, the coun­tries that are putting a lot of fund­ing be­hind rapid vac­cine de­vel­op­ment, are go­ing to see some pref­er­ence,” said Dr Kim.</p>
    <p>But mul­ti­lat­eral so­lu­tions, such as the Covax Fa­cil­ity, could help, he said. “That kind of mul­ti­lat­eral mech­a­nisms hope­fully will coun­ter­act some of the neg­a­tive ef­fects that are go­ing to be cre­ated in­ad­ver­tently by vac­cine na­tion­al­ism,” he said.</p>
