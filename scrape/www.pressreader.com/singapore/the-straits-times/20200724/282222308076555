    <p>LONDON • West Bromwich Al­bion de­fender Kyle Bart­ley ad­mit­ted that noth­ing worth it comes easy af­ter his side won pro­mo­tion back to the Premier League fol­low­ing a two-year ab­sence in a dra­matic fi­nale to the Cham­pi­onship cam­paign.</p>
    <p>West Brom are ex­pected to reap some £170 mil­lion (S$299 mil­lion) in re­wards in Eng­land’s top flight next sea­son and they were made to work for it on a nerve-shred­ding night at the Hawthorns on Wed­nes­day.</p>
    <p>Any­thing other than a win over Queen’s Park Rangers could have al­lowed Brent­ford to sneak into the run­ners-up spot be­hind cham­pi­ons Leeds United.</p>
    <p>As it turned out, a 2-2 draw was enough as Brent­ford were beaten 2-1 by Barns­ley.</p>
    <p>West Brom’s hopes of avoid­ing the or­deal of the play-offs, where they fell last sea­son, were wa­ver­ing when QPR took the l ead, then again when the vis­i­tors lev­elled mat­ters. At 2-2 and with Brent­ford draw­ing 1-1, they were walk­ing a tightrope, but news of Barns­ley’s win­ner of­fered respite for West Brom, who have been in the top two vir­tu­ally all sea­son but strug­gled since the restart fol­low­ing the three-month Covid-19 shut­down.</p>
    <p>“It’s been an emo­tional roller­coaster,” Bart­ley told BBC Ra­dio WM. “But noth­ing worth hav­ing in life is go­ing to come easy.”</p>
    <p>His man­ager Slaven Bilic ad­mit­ted he got more than he signed up for.</p>
    <p>“I was very vo­cal when I said I would al­ways like to man­age in the Cham­pi­onship be­cause it’s es­pe­cially dif­fi­cult,” said the for­mer Croa­tia boss.</p>
    <p>“I never imag­ined it would be this dif­fi­cult, this de­mand­ing. It’s ex­haust­ing. I didn’t en­joy every minute of it, of course, but with a fin­ish like this, the re­sults at the bot­tom, the (Not­ting­ham) For­est sit­u­a­tion, it’s un­be­liev­able.”</p>
    <p>For­est be­gan the night among the play-off spots and could only slip out if they lost, Cardiff City avoided de­feat and Swansea City won and made up six goals on For­est.</p>
    <p>Cardiff duly beat Hull City 3-0 to send them down to the third tier along­side Charl­ton.</p>
    <p>Swansea won 4-1 at Read­ing and For­est ca­pit­u­lated at home to Stoke City, con­ced­ing three late goals to lose by the same score.</p>
    <p>Swansea will now meet Brent­ford while Cardiff take on Ful­ham in the play-offs.</p>
    <p>“Foot­ball is 80 per cent suf­fer­ing and 10 per cent joy,” said Brent­ford man­ager Thomas Frank, whose side lost their last two games af­ter win­ning eight in a row and clos­ing a 10-point gap. “We need to go again and pick our­selves up.”</p>
    <p>Barns­ley’s un­likely win, sealed late on by sub­sti­tute Clarke Oduor, meant they would have fin­ished third from bot­tom on 49 points, but Wi­gan Ath­letic’s 12-point de­duc­tion for en­ter­ing ad­min­is­tra­tion meant they were saved – for now.</p>
    <p>Wi­gan would have stayed above the drop zone had any num­ber of late chances gone in dur­ing the 1-1 draw with Ful­ham. But the Lat­ics, now on 47 points, will have their fate de­cided by an ap­peal.</p>
