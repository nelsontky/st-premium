    <p>Mr Ni­cholas Koh dons gog­gles, gloves and an N95 mask for his photo shoot. He grips a gun-like de­vice in his hands and poses gamely for the pho­tog­ra­pher on the rooftop of the build­ing where his of­fice is lo­cated.</p>
    <p>The view of Sin­ga­pore’s progress be­low is scenic, yet rain clouds threaten over­head. It is an apt metaphor for the pan­demic-in­duced re­ces­sion.</p>
    <p>“The storm is com­ing,” he says.</p>
    <p>The de­vice he wields turns out to be Tomi Ster­aMist, a “gold stan­dard” de­con­tam­i­na­tion so­lu­tion from the United States that his com­pany is now mar­ket­ing. Friends had in­tro­duced him to it in Fe­bru­ary, just as Covid-19 started its run around the world, and he se­cured its dis­tri­bu­tion rights to sev­eral coun­tries.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker, the af­fa­ble 60-year-old found him­self con­duct­ing prod­uct demon­stra­tions to cor­po­ra­tions and in­sti­tu­tions to se­cure sales. To feel safer, as he was “very wor­ried” about be­ing ex­posed to the coro­n­avirus, he wore a gad­get that emits neg­a­tive ions.</p>
    <p>This year has been “truly un­charted wa­ters” for the former se­nior naval of­fi­cer-turne­den­trepreneur. Since 2005, he has been shut­tling be­tween Sin­ga­pore and Oman while run­ning Vic­tory Knights Man­age­ment and Con­sul­tancy Ser­vices.</p>
    <p>The firm pro­vides busi­ness de­vel­op­ment and master plan­ning ser­vices for firms that want to do busi­ness in the Gulf state. It works with a va­ri­ety of part­ners, in­clud­ing the Royal Navy of Oman and Ger­man con­glom­er­ate Siemens.</p>
    <p>Mr Koh was drawn to Oman be­cause of its wealth of nat­u­ral re­sources and blue sky po­ten­tial. It re­minded him of Sin­ga­pore in the 1970s and 1980s, when he was still serv­ing in the Repub­lic of Sin­ga­pore Navy.</p>
    <p>The navy scholar opted for early re­tire­ment in 2002, when he was lieu­tenant colonel and deputy head of naval lo­gis­tics (ship sys­tems), to try out cor­po­rate life.</p>
    <p>“Some of us who have the ben­e­fit of schol­ar­ships should go out there and bring the ex­ter­nal econ­omy back to Sin­ga­pore,” he says of his de­ci­sion to ven­ture abroad.</p>
    <p>Vic­tory Knights has a team of about 10, but is some­what of a fam­ily busi­ness too. His wife An­gel, 55, han­dles fi­nance, while daugh­ter Denise, 29, and son Edgar, 27, take charge of dif­fer­ent projects.</p>
    <p>He de­clines to share its rev­enue fig­ures, ex­cept to say that “there were times when it was really bad – you hit the bot­tom – and times when you ride high”.</p>
    <p>The pan­demic has brought his Oman projects to a stand­still, but the sur­vivor in him still has plenty of fight­ing spirit left.</p>
    <p>The fifth of six chil­dren of a lamp­shade-maker who was so poor at times that the fam­ily ate only rice with spicy dried shrimps – a story he re­counts in his self-pub­lished book, My Bowl Of Hei Bee Hiang Rice – Mr Koh be­lieves there must be “that hunger in your stom­ach... be­cause no one owes any­one a liv­ing”.</p>
    <p>To that end, he has also be­come a dis­tribut­ing part­ner for BioAc­u­men Global, a home­grown com­pany whose life­science di­ag­nos­tic prod­ucts help make Covid-19 test­ing more af­ford­able. Us­ing his ex­ten­sive net­work, he aims to push its kits out to var­i­ous coun­tries.</p>
    <p>Both his new ven­tures make a “frac­tion” of his pre­vi­ous rev­enue, he says, but he finds both “very mean­ing­ful” as they help in the fight against Covid-19.</p>
    <p>Call­ing the coro­n­avirus “the worst of all en­e­mies”, he says that the cri­sis has brought into fo­cus how frag­ile and un­pre­dictable life is.</p>
    <p>“To­day, the re­al­ity of life is that we are star­ing into some­thing in­vis­i­ble, that can kill you any time,” he ex­pounds. That is why he in­tends to pub­lish a sec­ond book which will re­count his en­tre­pre­neur­ial jour­ney.</p>
    <p>Early re­tire­ment is not an op­tion for the spritely sex­a­ge­nar­ian, who says he does not be­lieve in wast­ing time.</p>
    <p>“Fail­ure is the next mo­ti­va­tion for suc­cess. If we give up, we would have failed our fore­fa­thers, our pi­o­neers in Sin­ga­pore.”</p>
