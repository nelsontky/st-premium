    <p>Some Sin­ga­pore­ans liv­ing in pri­vate es­tates or big­ger homes may be se­verely af­fected by the Covid-19 cri­sis, but are un­able to qual­ify for cer­tain sup­port schemes as el­i­gi­bil­ity is pegged to the an­nual value of the homes they live in.</p>
    <p>Three MPs yes­ter­day urged the Govern­ment to re­view this cri­te­rion of means-test­ing Sin­ga­pore­ans for fi­nan­cial aid to en­sure th­ese peo­ple are not left out in­ad­ver­tently.</p>
    <p>For in­stance, newly di­vorced Sin­ga­pore­ans, sin­gle par­ents re­turn­ing to live with their el­derly par­ents, and soon-to-be mar­ried chil­dren wait­ing to move into Build-To-Or­der flats un­der con­struc­tion may not qual­ify for schemes like the Self-Em­ployed Per­son In­come Re­lief Scheme (Sirs) be­cause of the cri­te­rion, said Mr Christo­pher de Souza (Hol­land-Bukit Timah GRC) dur­ing the de­bate on the Pres­i­dent’s Ad­dress.</p>
    <p>He called for sup­port schemes to as­sess el­i­gi­bil­ity based on home own­er­ship, rather than the value and type of res­i­dence.</p>
    <p>Among other cri­te­ria, Sirs is open to those who earn a net trade in­come of no more than $100,000, live in a prop­erty with an an­nual value of no more than $21,000, and do not own two or more prop­er­ties.</p>
    <p>The scheme helps the self-em­ployed who have been af­fected by the pan­demic. Those who do not meet the cri­te­ria can ap­peal to the au­thor­i­ties, who will as­sess their el­i­gi­bil­ity on a case-by-case ba­sis.</p>
    <p>Sim­i­larly, Mr Lim Biow Chuan (Mount­bat­ten) said the pol­icy of peg­ging so­cial as­sis­tance to an­nual val­ues of prop­er­ties should be re­viewed, even as he agreed that the lower-in­come and the needy should get more help.</p>
    <p>He pointed out that cit­i­zens suf­fer­ing from loss of in­come may need help, re­gard­less of their hous­ing type, to pay for fam­ily ex­penses such as med­i­cal bills, mort­gage in­stal­ments or school fees.</p>
    <p>They may also not be able to sell their home dur­ing a fi­nan­cial cri­sis, he added.</p>
    <p>“Why do we have the ex­pec­ta­tion that peo­ple don’t de­serve help sim­ply be­cause they have big­ger homes of a higher an­nual value? Should we not look at their loss of in­come? Should we also in­sist that th­ese peo­ple must sell their homes be­fore they get the short-term help specif­i­cally tar­geted at those af­fected by Covid-19?” he asked.</p>
    <p>Mr Henry Kwek (Ke­bun Baru) said it would be timely for the Govern­ment to ad­just poli­cies for groups, in­clud­ing re­tired se­niors who are as­set-rich but cash-poor, and res­i­dents older than 50 who are fac­ing un­cer­tainty in their ca­reers.</p>
    <p>Dif­fer­ent yard­sticks can be used to as­sess el­i­gi­bil­ity for sup­port schemes, in­clud­ing us­ing a mix of non-hous­ing as­sets, in­come and the per capita hous­ing eq­uity of oc­cu­pants in a house, he sug­gested.</p>
    <p>Mr Kwek also sug­gested that the Govern­ment work with the bank­ing and in­sur­ance sec­tors to cre­ate re­verse mort­gage op­tions for pri­vate es­tates, and al­low those who are older than 70 to bor­row against their hous­ing eq­uity at a rea­son­able rate.</p>
    <p>“If our peo­ple can tap their hous­ing eq­uity ef­fec­tively, I be­lieve most Sin­ga­pore­ans in the pri­vate es­tates would pre­fer to stand on their own two feet, in­stead of re­ly­ing on govern­ment as­sis­tance,” he said.</p>
