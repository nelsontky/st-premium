    <p>The board of di­rec­tors at be­lea­guered firm Ax­ing­ton has been re­duced to a shell af­ter a string of abrupt res­ig­na­tions over re­cent days, in­clud­ing that of Chi­nese gem mer­chant Evan­ge­line Shen.</p>
    <p>Ms Shen, Ax­ing­ton’s non-in­de­pen­dent non-ex­ec­u­tive chair­man, is linked to a com­pany that doc­tored im­ages of the co-founders with former United States pres­i­dent Barack Obama.</p>
    <p>Ax­ing­ton, a Catal­ist-listed pro­fes­sional ad­vi­sory ser­vices firm, now has just two in­de­pen­dent di­rec­tors af­ter Ms Shen and three oth­ers quit in re­cent days – news the com­pany re­vealed in four fil­ings with the Sin­ga­pore Ex­change (SGX) af­ter mid­night on Mon­day.</p>
    <p>The res­ig­na­tions cap a tu­mul­tuous week for Ax­ing­ton and the Sin­ga­pore-reg­is­tered Bel­la­graph Nova (BN) Group, which has drawn in­tense scru­tiny fol­low­ing news of its takeover bid for English Pre­mier League club Newcastle United.</p>
    <p>The BN Group was founded by Ms Shen and her Sin­ga­porean busi­ness part­ners Ter­ence Loh, 42, and Nel­son Loh, 40, who are cousins. The Lohs are Ax­ing­ton’s con­trol­ling share­hold­ers.</p>
    <p>BN Group’s am­bi­tious bid soured quickly af­ter the Obama photo scan­dal broke and in­con­sis­ten­cies in pub­lic­ity ma­te­ri­als sur­faced.</p>
    <p>The dis­clo­sures prompted the SGX’s reg­u­la­tory arm to call on Aug 24 for Ax­ing­ton’s Catal­ist spon­sor, Novus Cor­po­rate Fi­nance, to as­sess the board mem­bers for their “ex­pe­ri­ence, ex­per­tise, char­ac­ter and in­tegrity”.</p>
    <p>A day later, former US am­bas­sador to Sin­ga­pore Kirk Wa­gar told The Straits Times that he had quit as an in­de­pen­dent di­rec­tor.</p>
    <p>Trad­ing of the counter was halted af­ter this. An ex­tra­or­di­nary gen­eral meet­ing (EGM) sched­uled for last Thurs­day was also post­poned, as more rev­e­la­tions about in­con­sis­ten­cies con­tin­ued to sur­face and in­di­vid­u­als and or­gan­i­sa­tions either de­nied links or dis­tanced them­selves from the BN Group.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day’s fil­ings said Ax­ing­ton’s ex­ec­u­tive di­rec­tor Mar­jory Loh and non-in­de­pen­dent non-ex­ec­u­tive di­rec­tor Michael Wong Soon Yuh re­signed on Aug 28.</p>
    <p>Ms Shen, 32, fol­lowed on Aug 30 along­side lead in­de­pen­dent di­rec­tor Alex Chua Siong Kiat.</p>
    <p>The rea­sons given ranged from im­pend­ing changes in the com­pany’s busi­ness to “in­tense pub­lic scru­tiny” and “health rea­sons”.</p>
    <p>Ms Shen, Ms Loh, Mr Chua, Mr Wong and two other in­de­pen­dent di­rec­tors – Mr Daryl Low Jun­rui and Mr Roberto Dona – were ap­pointed to the board on July 14.</p>
    <p>This fol­lowed Ax­ing­ton’s takeover by the Loh cousins.</p>
    <p>The five res­ig­na­tions leave Ax­ing­ton’s board with just Mr Low and Mr</p>
    <p>NOT RIGHT MOVE Board mem­bers should not sim­ply quit at the first sign of po­ten­tial trou­ble. Di­rec­tors owe a fidu­ciary duty to the share­hold­ers ’’ and to the mar­ket. GIB­SON DUNN PART­NER ROB­SON LEE, on the string of abrupt res­ig­na­tions from Ax­ing­ton’s board in re­cent days.</p>
    <p>Dona. Mr Low is chief ex­ec­u­tive and di­rec­tor of Hy­dra X, claimed by BN Group to be one of its 31 sub­sidiaries. Mr Dona is the as­so­ciate dean for pro­fes­sional en­gage­ment at Xi’anJiao­tong Liver­pool Univer­sity.</p>
    <p>The de­par­tures raised ques­tions over whether the com­pany is try­ing to avoid fur­ther scru­tiny on the suit­abil­ity of its board, ob­servers say.</p>
    <p>“Board mem­bers should not sim­ply quit at the first sign of po­ten­tial trou­ble. Di­rec­tors owe a fidu­ciary duty to the share­hold­ers and to the mar­ket,” said Gib­son Dunn part­ner Rob­son Lee.</p>
    <p>Some lawyers noted that the Ax­ing­ton board now has in­suf­fi­cient mem­bers to form a proper au­dit com­mit­tee. Catal­ist rules state that if a res­ig­na­tion ren­ders the au­dit com­mit­tee un­able to meet the min­i­mum num­ber – no fewer than three – then the firm must fill the va­can­cies within three months.</p>
    <p>An SGX spokesman said: “Catal­ist rules do not pro­hibit the res­ig­na­tion of di­rec­tors as long as the ces­sa­tion is an­nounced in a timely and com­pli­ant man­ner.</p>
    <p>“Ax­ing­ton has made dis­clo­sures, in­clud­ing an­nounc­ing that exit in­ter­views have been done per Catal­ist rule re­quire­ments. It has also dis­closed that its board is re­view­ing its com­po­si­tion to en­sure com­pli­ance with the rules.”</p>
    <p>Cor­po­rate gov­er­nance ad­vo­cate and Na­tional Univer­sity of Sin­ga­pore (NUS) Busi­ness School as­so­ciate pro­fes­sor Mak Yuen Teen was not sur­prised by the res­ig­na­tions.</p>
    <p>“(Ms Shen) should go, given the con­nec­tions with the Loh (cousins) and the ques­tions sur­round­ing them,” he said.</p>
    <p>He added that there has been poor cor­po­rate gov­er­nance in this case, with ques­tions about the char­ac­ter and in­tegrity of those in con­trol.</p>
    <p>NUS as­so­ciate pro­fes­sor Lawrence Loh pointed to Ax­ing­ton’s post­poned EGM and noted that the Loh cousins still own a su­per-ma­jor­ity stake in the com­pany and can tech­ni­cally push any res­o­lu­tion through.</p>
    <p>“The crux of the mat­ter is there­fore one of mi­nor­ity share­holder pro­tec­tion,” said Prof Loh, who is also di­rec­tor of the Cen­tre for Gov­er­nance, In­sti­tu­tions and Or­gan­i­sa­tions.</p>
    <p>“The spon­sor will have the re­spon­si­bil­ity to en­sure that com­pany af­fairs are con­ducted in the in­ter­ests of... the 200 pub­lic share­hold­ers which col­lec­tively hold about 22 per cent of the stock.”</p>
