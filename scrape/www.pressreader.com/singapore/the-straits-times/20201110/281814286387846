    <p>SEOUL • Head­line-grab­bing sum­mits be­tween the lead­ers of North Korea and the United States will be off the agenda for some time, an­a­lysts say, af­ter US Pres­i­dent-elect Joe Bi­den char­ac­terised Mr Kim Jong Un a “thug”, in con­trast to Mr Don­ald Trump’s dec­la­ra­tions of love.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump’s bizarre diplo­matic en­gage­ment with Py­ongyang veered from mu­tual in­sults and threats of war to “love let­ters” and the first ever meet­ing be­tween a sit­ting US pres­i­dent and a North Korean leader. The two mer­cu­rial men met twice more af­ter their land­mark sum­mit in Sin­ga­pore in 2018, but with no progress in de­nu­cle­ari­sa­tion ef­forts.</p>
    <p>Now Mr Bi­den’s vic­tory her­alds a re­turn to more stan­dard diplo­matic norms, an­a­lysts say, with his ad­min­is­tra­tion want­ing to see tan­gi­ble steps to­wards de­nu­cle­ari­sa­tion and progress at a se­ries of work­ing-level ne­go­ti­a­tions be­fore any made-forTV sum­mits. On the cam­paign trail, Mr Bi­den had said he would not meet Mr Kim with­out pre-con­di­tions and ac­cused Mr Trump of “em­bold­en­ing” the North Korean leader.</p>
    <p>In the fi­nal pres­i­den­tial de­bate last month, the Demo­crat de­nounced Mr Trump for be­friend­ing Mr Kim, liken­ing the North Korean leader to Adolf Hitler. “He’s talked about his good buddy, who’s a thug,” Mr Bi­den said of Mr Kim. “That’s like say­ing we had a good re­la­tion­ship with Hitler be­fore he in­vaded Europe.”</p>
    <p>For its part, while Py­ongyang’s state me­dia has yet to men­tion the US elec­tion or the re­sult, it has pre­vi­ously ex­co­ri­ated Mr Bi­den, with the of­fi­cial Korean Cen­tral News Agency call­ing him a “ra­bid dog” that must be “beaten to death”.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to an­a­lysts, North Korea saw in Mr Trump’s un­ortho­dox ap­proach its best chance of se­cur­ing a deal that would al­low it to keep at least some of its nu­clear weapons and in­ter­con­ti­nen­tal bal­lis­tic mis­siles, both of which are banned un­der UN Se­cu­rity Coun­cil res­o­lu­tions.</p>
    <p>Py­ongyang will be “slightly peeved by the change in lead­er­ship”, said for­mer Cen­tral In­tel­li­gence Agency an­a­lyst Soo Kim. “The regime is aware the prospects of a top-level meet­ing with a US leader are go­ing to be slim now,” she added. “We’re ex­pect­ing a more principled, sys­tem­atic ap­proach to Py­ongyang. This likely means less ad hoc in­ter­ac­tions and some method to deal­ing with Kim.”</p>
    <p>North Korea de­spises Mr Bi­den for his role in the Obama ad­min­is­tra­tion, which adopted a pol­icy of “strate­gic pa­tience”, re­fus­ing to en­gage with Py­ongyang un­less it of­fered con­ces­sions first, or un­til the regime col­lapsed from within.</p>
