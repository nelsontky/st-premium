    <p>WASH­ING­TON • US Pres­i­dent-elect Joe Bi­den said on Thurs­day that he be­lieved ef­forts to use his son as a po­lit­i­cal cud­gel amounted to “foul play”, amid a fed­eral in­ves­ti­ga­tion into Mr Hunter Bi­den’s tax mat­ters and Repub­li­can calls for a special coun­sel in­ves­ti­ga­tion into his for­eign deal­ings.</p>
    <p>“We have great con­fi­dence in our son,” Mr Bi­den said in an in­ter­view with CBS late-night host Stephen Col­bert. “I’m not con­cerned about any ac­cu­sa­tions that have been made against him; it’s used to get me. I think it’s kind of foul play but – look, it is what it is.”</p>
    <p>CBS News orig­i­nally re­ported that Mr Bi­den had called the fed­eral in­ves­ti­ga­tion it­self “foul play”.</p>
    <p>But the Bi­den cam­paign de­nied that char­ac­ter­i­sa­tion and re­leased a fuller tran­script of the ex­change, say­ing the Pres­i­dent-elect was de­scrib­ing broader ef­forts to po­lit­i­cally ex­ploit his son’s busi­ness deal­ings.</p>
    <p>“There has in­dis­putably been ‘foul play’ of that ex­act kind,” Bi­den spokesman An­drew Bates tweeted, re­fer­ring to peo­ple who use Mr Hunter Bi­den as a “cud­gel” against his fa­ther.</p>
    <p>“Trump got him­self im­peached en­gag­ing in it.” The com­ments were some of Mr Bi­den’s most ex­ten­sive since the dis­clo­sure ear­lier this month of the in­ves­ti­ga­tion into his son’s tax deal­ings.</p>
    <p>The probes in­clude one led by the Delaware US at­tor­ney’s of­fice into whether Mr Hunter Bi­den vi­o­lated tax laws. An­other by the US at­tor­ney for the western dis­trict of Penn­syl­va­nia con­cerns his ac­tiv­i­ties in Ukraine and po­ten­tial money laun­der­ing, ac­cord­ing to a per­son fa­mil­iar with the mat­ter who dis­cussed the sen­si­tive in­quiry on con­di­tion of anonymity. At least one of the probes has been on­go­ing since 2018, an­other per­son said.</p>
    <p>But the ef­fort has been clouded by Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump’s prece­dent-shat­ter­ing pub­lic de­mands for an in­quiry into Mr Bi­den’s son. As re­cently as Sunday, Mr Trump com­plained that At­tor­ney-Gen­eral Wil­liam Barr did not dis­close the fed­eral tax in­quiry be­fore Elec­tion Day. Mr Trump, in a tweet ear­lier on Thurs­day, de­nied play­ing any role in de­ci­sions re­gard­ing the in­ves­ti­ga­tion.</p>
    <p>Mr Barr an­nounced on Monday that he plans to re­sign be­fore Christ­mas. He made the an­nounce­ment shortly af­ter Mr Trump crit­i­cised him in an in­ter­view with Fox News and White House press sec­re­tary Kayleigh McE­nany told the net­work the Pres­i­dent was “frus­trated” Mr Barr had not done more to high­light the Hunter Bi­den case to vot­ers.</p>
    <p>Repub­li­can law­mak­ers – in­clud­ing Se­nate Ju­di­ciary chair­man Lind­sey Gra­ham of South Carolina – have also seized on the probe, call­ing for the ap­point­ment of a special coun­sel.</p>
    <p>Mr Col­bert asked Mr Bi­den about his re­la­tion­ship with Mr Gra­ham, a long-time friend, in the light of Mr Gra­ham’s sup­port for Mr Trump’s ef­forts to over­turn the elec­tion re­sults. “Lind­sey’s been a per­sonal dis­ap­point­ment be­cause I was a per­sonal friend of his,” Mr Bi­den said. He also said he would reach out to Repub­li­cans – even those who at­tack him – “if it ben­e­fits the coun­try”.</p>
    <p>The in­ves­ti­ga­tion into Mr Hunter Bi­den’s Ukraine work be­gan based on in­for­ma­tion pro­vided by Mr Trump’s per­sonal lawyer Rudy Gi­u­liani, spurring ten­sions be­tween Jus­tice Depart­ment of­fi­cials over how cred­i­ble the al­le­ga­tions were.</p>
    <p>Mr Hunter Bi­den con­firmed that the in­ves­ti­ga­tion into his taxes is con­tin­u­ing. It was not clear if the Ukraine-re­lated in­ves­ti­ga­tion is still on­go­ing.</p>
    <p>The Bi­dens have re­peat­edly in­sisted no wrong­do­ing was com­mit­ted, and the Pres­i­dent-elect on Thurs­day again voiced sup­port for his son. “As long as he’s good, we’re good,” Mr Bi­den said.</p>
