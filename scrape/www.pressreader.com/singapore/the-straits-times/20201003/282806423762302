    <p>• Kris Jen­ner (left) has been sued by her for­mer se­cu­rity guard for al­leged sex­ual ha­rass­ment, a charge which the Amer­i­can re­al­i­tytele­vi­sion star has de­nied.</p>
    <p>Jen­ner, 64, was sued for un­spec­i­fied dam­ages to­gether with her el­dest daughter Kourt­ney Kar­dashian, 41, and the pri­vate se­cu­rity firm for which the for­mer guard worked.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to court doc­u­ments ob­tained by var­i­ous United States me­dia, the ac­cuser was iden­ti­fied as Mr Marc McWil­liams, a black man who said he was hired to be Jen­ner’s se­cu­rity guard in May 2017. He was ter­mi­nated from the job in Septem­ber 2018.</p>
    <p>Mr McWil­liams, 51, claimed that he was sub­jected to “sex­ual ad­vances and oth­er­wise ha­rass­ing mis­con­duct” by Jen­ner.</p>
    <p>He also claimed that he was sub­jected to com­ments of “an overt sex­ual na­ture” about his phys­i­cal ap­pear­ance and sex­ual ac­tiv­i­ties as well as sug­ges­tions he “en­gage in a ro­man­tic and sex­ual re­la­tion­ship”.</p>
    <p>He also ac­cused Jen­ner, among other things, of “non-con­sen­sual phys­i­cal con­tact” with him.</p>
    <p>He fur­ther claimed that his sub­se­quent com­plaints to the se­cu­rity com­pany’s hu­man re­sources de­part­ment were ig­nored.</p>
    <p>How­ever, Jen­ner’s lawyer Marty Singer told celebrity web­site TMZ, which first re­ported the news, that “Kris cat­e­gor­i­cally de­nies ever be­hav­ing in­ap­pro­pri­ately to­wards Marc McWil­liams”.</p>
    <p>Mr Singer said Jen­ner “had very lit­tle in­ter­ac­tion with” Mr McWil­liams and that the for­mer se­cu­rity guard “was re­peat­edly caught sleep­ing in his car while on the job”.</p>
    <p>The l awyer added that while Kar­dashian is named in the suit, “she is not ac­cused of do­ing any­thing im­proper with the guard nor did she do so”.</p>
    <p>Jen­ner rose to fame af­ter star­ring in the re­al­ity tele­vi­sion se­ries Keep­ing Up With The Kar­dashi­ans (2007 to present) with her chil­dren, in­clud­ing Kar­dashian and Kim Kar­dashian West. The mega-celebrity fam­ily an­nounced last month that the re­al­ity show will end next year.</p>
