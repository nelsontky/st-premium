    <p>Each mem­ber of a Sin­ga­porean house­hold has re­ceived an av­er­age of $1,500 in Covid-19-re­lated sup­port, said Deputy Prime Min­is­ter Heng Swee Keat.</p>
    <p>In ad­di­tion, more than 300,000 Sin­ga­porean house­holds have ben­e­fited from a voucher scheme launched by the com­mu­nity de­vel­op­ment coun­cils (CDCs) in June to help needy fam­i­lies with daily ex­penses, he added.</p>
    <p>A sec­ond tranche of vouch­ers – worth $50 each – will be given out in the next few months, he told the House yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The Gov­ern­ment has moved de­ci­sively to take care of Sin­ga­pore­ans with an un­prece­dented $5.9 bil­lion of house­hold trans­fers this year, he said in a speech to round up a two-day de­bate on the Gov­ern­ment’s strat­egy to emerge stronger from the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>“This is the largest amount we have ever dis­bursed in a sin­gle year,” he said, not­ing that more than 2.8 mil­lion Sin­ga­pore res­i­dents have ben­e­fited from some com­bi­na­tion of cash pay­outs from var­i­ous sup­port schemes.</p>
    <p>The $1,500 in re­lief re­ceived by each house­hold mem­ber on av­er­age is equiv­a­lent to about half a month of their in­come.</p>
    <p>Lower- and mid­dle-in­come house­holds re­ceived more help from the Care and Sup­port Pack­age, Mr Heng said, not­ing that house­holds in the bot­tom 50 per cent based on per capita house­hold in­come got the equiv­a­lent of two months of their in­come on av­er­age.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, the CDC Vouch­ers Scheme, which also aims to sup­port lo­cal hawk­ers and heart­land mer­chants, has at­tracted sign-ups from more than 8,000 mer­chants.</p>
    <p>DEEP RESER­VOIR OF SO­CIAL RE­SERVES</p>
    <p>Mr Heng also high­lighted the im­por­tance of help­ing vul­ner­a­ble groups such as se­niors.</p>
    <p>He pointed to the Se­niors Go Dig­i­tal move­ment launched in May, and the 1,000 dig­i­tal am­bas­sadors de­ployed to help se­niors, hawk­ers and heart­land en­ter­prises ac­quire dig­i­tal skills. More than 28,000 se­niors have par­tic­i­pated in at least one train­ing pro­gramme as of endSeptem­ber, he said.</p>
    <p>He also ac­knowl­edged the men­tal health is­sues raised by MPs, and cited the Covid-19 Men­tal Well­ness</p>
    <p>Task­force and Youth Men­tal Well­be­ing Net­work as pos­i­tive ex­am­ples of ini­tia­tives set up to tackle con­cerns in this area.</p>
    <p>Mr Heng praised ground-up com­mu­nity move­ments founded to help those in need, such as Kam­pung Kakis, a neigh­bour­hood buddy sys­tem to sup­port the el­derly, low-in­come fam­i­lies and vul­ner­a­ble res­i­dents in the cur­rent cri­sis. “Vol­un­teer ‘kakis’ were the ad­di­tional eyes and ears of our grass­roots lead­ers, who guided their ‘kakis in need’ to avail­able re­sources and en­sured vul­ner­a­ble res­i­dents re­ceived as­sis­tance.”</p>
    <p>On top of such ef­forts, Mr Heng en­cour­aged those who could to con­tinue do­nat­ing gen­er­ously dur­ing this pe­riod.</p>
    <p>Do­na­tions to Covid-19-re­lated causes across key plat­forms such as the Com­mu­nity Chest, the Sayang Sayang Fund and Giv­ing.sg hit a to­tal of $100 mil­lion from Jan­uary to Au­gust this year – more than the over­all do­na­tions re­ceived by the Com­mu­nity Chest and Giv­ing.sg for the whole of last year, he noted.</p>
    <p>He cited Amer­i­can de­fence com­pany Lock­heed Martin, which do­nated the pay­outs it re­ceived from the Jobs Sup­port Scheme to The In­vic­tus Fund and The Courage Fund pro­grammes set up by the Na­tional Coun­cil of So­cial Ser­vice.</p>
    <p>“It is heart-warm­ing to see the deep reser­voir of so­cial re­serves that we have grown as a co­he­sive and re­silient nation state,” Mr Heng said.</p>
    <p>“This is the spirit of SG To­gether in ac­tion – a com­mu­nity of deeds, where we sup­port one another, com­bine our var­i­ous strengths and make sure no one is left be­hind.”</p>
