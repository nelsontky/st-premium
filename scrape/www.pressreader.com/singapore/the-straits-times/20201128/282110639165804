    <p>The hotly an­tic­i­pated Covid-19 vac­cines are al­most here. Now for the is­sue of how to dis­pense them to the masses.</p>
    <p>Across the globe, gov­ern­ments are gear­ing up to roll out na­tion­wide in­oc­u­la­tion cam­paigns, as the devel­op­ment of a hand­ful of ex­per­i­men­tal vac­cines inches closer to the fin­ish line. They are set to face a host of chal­lenges and make many judg­ment calls in their vac­ci­na­tion strate­gies.</p>
    <p>With sev­eral vac­cines hav­ing proven ef­fec­tive in large clin­i­cal tri­als, reg­u­la­tors may grant ap­proval for their use in the com­ing weeks, and dis­tri­bu­tion is set to start im­me­di­ately after­wards.</p>
    <p>“We need to be able to make a lot of vac­cine for the world quickly… (so) diver­sity is go­ing to be good here,” said Pro­fes­sor Sarah Gil­bert, a leader of the team work­ing on Bri­tain’s Ox­ford Univer­sity-As­traZeneca vac­cine, in an As­so­ci­ated Press re­port ear­lier this week.</p>
    <p>Who goes first, and why?</p>
    <p>With most of the vac­cine front run­ners in­volv­ing West­ern de­vel­op­ers, Asian na­tions are ex­pected to ini­tially re­ceive less of the pre­cious com­mod­ity and at later stages than their Amer­i­can and Euro­pean coun­ter­parts.</p>
    <p>Richer and more pow­er­ful coun­tries, as well as those that helped in test­ing or pro­duc­ing the vac­cines, may also gain ac­cess to them sooner.</p>
    <p>Upon re­ceiv­ing the vac­cines, gov­ern­ments will have to get them into their cit­i­zens’ arms as soon as pos­si­ble to bring a swift end to the pan­demic. Per­ti­nent is­sues in­clude who among the pop­u­lace will be en­ti­tled to a spot at the front of the queue. Pri­or­i­ties will dif­fer from coun­try to coun­try.</p>
    <p>Malaysia, for one, has said it will fo­cus on in­oc­u­lat­ing only adults, as the ex­per­i­men­tal vac­cines have yet to be tested on chil­dren un­der the age of 12. The United States-Ger­many team work­ing on the Pfizer-BioNTech vac­cine has only just be­gun test­ing on teenagers.</p>
    <p>In­done­sia in­tends to cover twothirds of its peo­ple aged 18 to 59 who are deemed fit and with­out pre-ex­ist­ing health con­di­tions, as most of the vac­cine tri­als have ex­cluded peo­ple out­side this age bracket. Health­care and emer­gency ser­vice work­ers will get the shots be­fore ev­ery­one else. The el­derly can get vac­ci­nated on a vol­un­tary ba­sis.</p>
    <p>Ja­pan, mean­while, plans to grant its el­derly pri­or­ity over those with chronic dis­eases, as re­search shows older peo­ple face sig­nif­i­cantly higher risks of con­tract­ing se­vere Covid-19. The coun­try has the world’s largest el­derly pop­u­la­tion, with nearly 29 per cent – more than one in ev­ery four peo­ple – aged 65 or older.</p>
    <p>India is likely to give its health­care and front-line work­ers top­most pri­or­ity as “they are at max­i­mum risk of ex­po­sure to the virus”, a se­nior health min­istry of­fi­cial said this week.</p>
    <p>The strat­egy makes sense as it is para­mount for India – with the world’s sec­ond-high­est num­ber of Covid-19 cases after the United States – to keep its health­care sys­tem up and run­ning to deal with its flood of in­fec­tions.</p>
    <p>Malaysia and India are look­ing into of­fer­ing free vac­ci­na­tions, and Ja­pan has al­ready con­firmed it will do so for all its res­i­dents. In­done­sia is cov­er­ing vac­ci­na­tions for 30 per cent of those in its tar­get vac­ci­na­tion group, while the oth­ers have to pay for their own shots.</p>
    <p>Speed is not a key con­cern for all, though. South Korea is in no hurry to ink deals de­spite hav­ing been of­fered more than 30 mil­lion doses of vac­cines by phar­ma­ceu­ti­cal firms.</p>
    <p>“What’s im­por­tant is to choose the safest and most ef­fec­tive vac­cine and to ac­quire them at an ac­cept­able and rea­son­able price,” Health Min­is­ter Park Ne­ung-hoo said last Sun­day.</p>
    <p>South Korean drug­mak­ers such as SK Bio­science and Cell­trion are also de­vel­op­ing their own Covid-19 vac­cines.</p>
    <p>“There’s no rea­son to bear the risk and rush to pre-or­der vac­cines when you can main­tain a (com­par­a­tively) low num­ber of cases,” Dr Chul-woo Rhee, a re­search sci­en­tist at the In­ter­na­tional Vac­cine In­sti­tute in Seoul, was quoted as say­ing in a Wall Street Jour­nal re­port last week. “South Korea is not in an ur­gent sit­u­a­tion like the US or Europe.”</p>
    <p>A del­i­cate bal­ance</p>
    <p>A re­cent US study has sug­gested that pri­ori­tis­ing vac­ci­nat­ing se­niors aged above 60 would have the big­gest im­pact in low­er­ing Covid-19 deaths, while vac­ci­nat­ing young adults first would have a greater im­pact on low­er­ing trans­mis­sion rates. In that light, most coun­tries’ vac­ci­na­tion strate­gies ap­pear aimed first and fore­most at pre­vent­ing deaths.</p>
    <p>In Europe, Bri­tain is tak­ing a largely age-based ap­proach, with el­derly care home res­i­dents and peo­ple aged over 80 on top of its list. Staff in care homes and health­care set­tings are also pri­ori­tised to min­imise the risk of trans­mit­ting the dis­ease to their charges. Get­ting in­oc­u­lated will cost £25 (S$45) for a two-dose reg­i­men.</p>
    <p>France’s in­oc­u­la­tion guide­lines in­clude pri­ori­tis­ing its five mil­lion work­ers in high-risk jobs, such as shop em­ploy­ees and trans­port work­ers with fre­quent pub­lic con­tact. This came after pub­lic con­sul­ta­tion to en­sure enough peo­ple would choose to get vac­ci­nated.</p>
    <p>Over in the US, the Na­tional Acad­e­mies of Sciences, En­gi­neer­ing and Medicine has pro­posed a five-phase plan with health­care work­ers and first re­spon­ders on top of the list, fol­lowed by peo­ple with high-risk un­der­ly­ing con­di­tions and older adults in densely pop­u­lated set­tings.</p>
    <p>Ex­per­i­men­tal shots</p>
    <p>In the mean­time, large num­bers of peo­ple in Rus­sia and China have al­ready re­ceived ex­per­i­men­tal vac­cine shots.</p>
    <p>Rus­sia has ad­min­is­tered its Sput­nik V vac­cine to at least tens of thou­sands of vol­un­teers out­side clin­i­cal tri­als, in­clud­ing med­i­cal work­ers and school teach­ers.</p>
    <p>How­ever, ge­og­ra­phy teacher Leonid Perlov, 60, told the Washington Post that he de­clined a vac­ci­na­tion of­fer as “it has not passed all of the nec­es­sary stages of test­ing”.</p>
    <p>“The bi­ol­ogy teach­ers are (also) not in a hurry to get vac­ci­nated,” Mr Perlov noted of the re­sponse among his peers.</p>
    <p>“They’re more cau­tious. But the his­tory teach­ers are the ones ready to vol­un­teer.”</p>
    <p>In China, about a mil­lion peo­ple have been in­oc­u­lated with a vac­cine from Sinopharm – one of the coun­try’s front run­ners – de­spite the state com­pany hav­ing yet to show solid late-stage clin­i­cal data of its efficacy. Two doses will cost un­der 1,000 yuan (S$200).</p>
    <p>“Among con­struc­tion per­son­nel, diplo­mats and over­seas stu­dents who have trav­elled to more than 150 coun­tries in the world, there has not been a sin­gle case of in­fec­tion after in­oc­u­la­tion,” Sinopharm said this month.</p>
    <p>At­ti­tudes to­wards vac­cines</p>
    <p>Chi­nese cit­i­zens have among the world’s high­est Covid-19 vac­cine ac­cep­tance rates, ac­cord­ing to an Ip­sos sur­vey con­ducted jointly with the World Eco­nomic Fo­rum, which polled more than 18,000 adults from 15 coun­tries last month.</p>
    <p>Some 85 per cent of Chi­nese re­spon­dents said they would def­i­nitely get i noc­u­lated when a Covid-19 vac­cine is avail­able.</p>
    <p>The poll also showed In­di­ans were the most will­ing to do so, at 87 per cent, with South Kore­ans in the third spot at 83 per cent. The French were the most re­sis­tant to the idea, at 54 per cent.</p>
    <p>Those who said they did not want to re­ceive a coro­n­avirus vac­cine were chiefly con­cerned about side ef­fects – with re­spon­dents in Ja­pan and China among those most wor­ried – or that the clin­i­cal tri­als had been too rushed.</p>
    <p>To be sure, vac­cine mak­ers will need a lot more data on how well their treat­ments per­form in dif­fer­ent age and eth­nic groups and among peo­ple with health con­di­tions, be­fore reg­u­la­tors can give them the nod for pub­lic use.</p>
    <p>For now, no coun­try has an­nounced plans to make Covid-19 vac­ci­na­tion manda­tory.</p>
    <p>Some gov­ern­ments have al­ready ruled this out, in­clud­ing France, Bri­tain and Ja­pan, though they em­pha­sised that their cit­i­zens would be strongly en­cour­aged to get the shots.</p>
    <p>“Manda­tory vac­ci­na­tion is rarely jus­ti­fied,” said Dr Vageesh Jain from the Univer­sity Col­lege London In­sti­tute for Global Health. “The suc­cess­ful roll-out of Covid-19 vac­cines will re­quire time, com­mu­ni­ca­tion and trust.”</p>
    <p>Other health ex­perts have ar­gued the case for com­pul­sory in­oc­u­la­tion for some groups as it could sig­nif­i­cantly lower the risk of se­ri­ously harm­ing or even killing oth­ers.</p>
    <p>Sev­eral air­lines and em­ploy­ers are con­sid­er­ing ways to im­ple­ment manda­tory vac­ci­na­tion poli­cies.</p>
    <p>“The less bur­den­some it is for an in­di­vid­ual to do some­thing that pre­vents harm to oth­ers, and the greater the harm pre­vented, the stronger the eth­i­cal rea­son for man­dat­ing it,” said Dr Al­berto Gi­u­bilini from The Ox­ford Ue­hiro Cen­tre for Prac­ti­cal Ethics and author of the book, The Ethics Of Vac­ci­na­tion.</p>
    <p>Im­mu­nol­o­gists agree that coun­tries would have to i noc­u­late around 60 per cent to 70 per cent of their pop­u­la­tions to achieve herd im­mu­nity against the coro­n­avirus. Ex­actly how to do so will be a key chal­lenge for gov­ern­ments around the world in the year to come.</p>
    <p>NO RUSH ’’</p>
    <p>There’s no rea­son to bear the risk and rush to pre-or­der vac­cines when you can main­tain a (com­par­a­tively) low num­ber of cases. South Korea is not in an ur­gent sit­u­a­tion like the US or Europe.</p>
    <p>DR CHUL-WOO RHEE, a re­search sci­en­tist at the In­ter­na­tional Vac­cine In­sti­tute in Seoul.</p>
