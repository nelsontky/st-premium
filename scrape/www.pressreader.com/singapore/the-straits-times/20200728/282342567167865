    <p>Most au­thors do not like to eat their words, but Bri­tish bi­ol­o­gist Mer­lin Shel­drake has done so with en­thu­si­asm.</p>
    <p>Upon re­ceiv­ing a copy of his de­but book, En­tan­gled Life, he seeded its pages with Pleu­ro­tus mycelium, a kind of oys­ter mush­room.</p>
    <p>He waited for the fun­gus to eat its way through the book, un­til the cov­ers sprouted mush­rooms. Then he ate them.</p>
    <p>“It’s very easy to be caught up with the ideas of how things work, to be dis­tracted by schemas and mod­els and sim­u­la­tions, and for­get that we’re talk­ing about a liv­ing world made of or­gan­isms with phys­i­cal, warm bod­ies,” says the 32-year-old over Skype.</p>
    <p>“This was a way of bring­ing me down to earth, of ground­ing me in my in­quiry and re­mind­ing me that these or­gan­isms live their own lives, whether or not I thought about them.”</p>
    <p>Shel­drake’s fas­ci­nat­ing, of­ten po­etic book in­tro­duces read­ers to the weird and won­der­ful world of fungi.</p>
    <p>In its pages are slime moulds that can de­ci­pher mazes and model mo­tor­way net­works; lichens that sur­vive in the harsh­est cli­mates for thou­sands of years; and “zom­bie fungi” that in­fect ants, forc­ing them to climb up high, where­upon the fun­gus sprouts a stalk out of its host’s head and show­ers spores down on un­wit­ting ants be­low.</p>
    <p>“If I think about mycelial growth for more than a minute,” he writes, “my mind starts to stretch.”</p>
    <p>Shel­drake is based in Lon­don but has spent the Bri­tish pan­demic lock­down iso­lated in the Mid­lands town Ne­wark-on-Trent, for the safety of his elderly par­ents. He thinks he had Covid-19 at some point, though with­out test­ing, he can­not be sure.</p>
    <p>“It came on very quickly and then I just felt com­pletely flat­tened, drained of en­ergy and it was very hard to get out of bed. Thank­fully, it lasted only a day.”</p>
    <p>He is the son of para­psy­chol­o­gist Ru­pert Shel­drake and voice teacher Jill Purce, and the older brother of mu­si­cian Cosmo Shel­drake, who is now turn­ing bio-elec­tric record­ings of the sounds of fun­gus di­gest­ing En­tan­gled Life into mu­sic.</p>
    <p>As a child, Mer­lin Shel­drake would dive into leaf piles and ob­serve their de­com­po­si­tion. As a teenager, he grew mush­rooms in his bed­room.</p>
    <p>As a plant sciences un­der­grad­u­ate at Cam­bridge Univer­sity, he be­came fas­ci­nated with sym­bio­sis. “In think­ing about sym­bio­sis, it’s very hard not to think about fungi be­cause fungi play such a big part in so many of the block­buster sym­bioses of the planet,” he says.</p>
    <p>Through­out his book, Shel­drake seems to be con­stantly phys­i­cally im­mers­ing him­self in fungi or in­gest­ing them.</p>
    <p>He buries him­self naked in a mound of de­com­pos­ing wood chips. He har­vests ap­ples from sci­en­tist Isaac New­ton’s tree, presses them into a cider he calls “Grav­ity” and drinks. He swal­lows LSD as part of a clin­i­cal study and tries to work through sci­en­tific prob­lems while high in a hos­pi­tal bed.</p>
    <p>“Fungi have the power to con­fuse many of the cat­e­gories and sys­tems that we use to or­gan­ise our lives and our ex­pe­ri­ences,” he says.</p>
    <p>“It can be con­fus­ing. It can be scary when those cat­e­gories start to break down, be­cause it rep­re­sents a kind of in­sta­bil­ity or loss of con­trol. I try in the book to find ways to take com­fort in un­cer­tainty, to keep peo­ple feel­ing com­fort­able in the space cre­ated by open ques­tions.”</p>
    <p>Part of the book looks at fun­gal solutions to en­vi­ron­men­tal prob­lems, from the white rot fungi that can grow on a diet of used di­a­pers, to Eco­v­a­tive, a com­pany that cre­ates prod­ucts such as pack­ag­ing, leather and fur­ni­ture out of mycelium.</p>
    <p>Fungi make worlds and un­make them, says Shel­drake. “They live their lives en­tan­gled with their sur­round­ings as these mycelial net­works and they’re a good re­minder that we all live our lives en­tan­gled with our en­vi­ron­ments. Our en­vi­ron­ments are them­selves made up of or­gan­isms en­tan­gled with their en­vi­ron­ment.</p>
    <p>“It’s by for­get­ting this, or not pay­ing enough at­ten­tion to this, that we’re able to jus­tify de­struc­tive be­hav­iour to other hu­mans and to the en­vi­ron­ment – the tangle of climate break­down, en­vi­ron­men­tal degra­da­tion, mass ex­tinc­tion and so­cial in­jus­tice.</p>
    <p>“To ad­mit that we live our lives en­tan­gled with or­gan­isms that we share the planet with is a big part in our com­ing to terms with the sit­u­a­tion we’re in, and to look for ways out of it.”</p>
