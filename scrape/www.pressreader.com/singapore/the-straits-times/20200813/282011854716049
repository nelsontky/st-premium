    <p>The bur­geon­ing pub­lic at­ten­tion on whether Sin­ga­pore should have a uni­ver­sal min­i­mum wage pol­icy has spurred ro­bust de­bate.</p>
    <p>While the en­gage­ment of di­verse voices is a re­fresh­ing scene af­ter the 2020 Gen­eral Elec­tion, the de­bate ap­pears to have be­come more about ide­ol­ogy than ev­i­dence.</p>
    <p>Im­plicit in some com­men­ta­tors’ views is the ques­tion: If you care about the bot­tom 10 per cent, how can you not sup­port a min­i­mum wage? Un­less cap­i­tal­ism has hi­jacked your moral sense.</p>
    <p>But, for al­most any eco­nomic in­ter­ven­tion, blind ad­vo­cacy is as tone-deaf as out­right re­jec­tion. Many from both sides of the ar­gu­ment care deeply about the bot­tom 10 per cent, but are un­able to align on whether a min­i­mum wage is or isn’t the best pol­icy to help them.</p>
    <p>The root cause for this dis­agree­ment is the lack of con­crete em­pir­i­cal ev­i­dence in Sin­ga­pore. Of course, prece­dents in other de­vel­oped coun­tries are dis­cussed, aca­demic re­search con­ducted in the United States or Europe cited, ex­pert opin­ions from home and abroad con­sulted.</p>
    <p>How­ever, such ev­i­dence is at best anec­do­tal to Sin­ga­pore’s re­al­ity.</p>
    <p>Take as an ex­am­ple a widely cited 2018 aca­demic study by econ­o­mist Eka­te­rina Jardim and col­lab­o­ra­tors, which looked at a size­able min­i­mum wage raise in Seattle in 2014. The economists found an in­crease in work­ers’ earn­ings and a mod­est de­cline in work hours. Only the earn­ings by young en­try-level work­ers seemed to have been neg­a­tively af­fected by di­min­ished job op­por­tu­ni­ties.</p>
    <p>Can we rely on this in­sight to tri­umph a min­i­mum wage in Sin­ga­pore, as most of our youth are not par­tic­u­larly un­der­priv­i­leged and should fo­cus on learn­ing in­stead of work­ing any­way?</p>
    <p>Be­fore one takes the re­sults at face value, we should note that the group of “young work­ers” in the con­text of Seattle’s labour force is ac­tu­ally rem­i­nis­cent of those “aged and un­skilled” in Sin­ga­pore: in­ex­pe­ri­enced, lack­ing pro­fes­sional train­ing, work­ing in sim­ple job func­tions such as bus­ing and clean­ing, and vul­ner­a­ble to ma­chine re­place­ment.</p>
    <p>In fact, the sheer vol­ume of re­cent pol­icy and aca­demic re­search tes­ti­fies that min­i­mum wage re­mains a hotly de­bated topic. Caveat­ing and re­cal­i­brat­ing re­search from other coun­tries can hardly ac­com­mo­date all the im­por­tant nu­ances in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>WHAT A MIN­I­MUM WAGE STUDY SHOULD AD­DRESS</p>
    <p>We should in­stead com­mis­sion a suite of Sin­ga­pore-spe­cific stud­ies to in­form the de­bate, us­ing sci­en­tif­i­cally rig­or­ous meth­ods and ac­tual data col­lected in the cur­rent eco­nomic head­winds. Fo­cus­ing on the wel­fare of the bot­tom 10 per cent, we will need to an­swer the fol­low­ing four ques­tions with solid num­ber es­ti­mates:</p>
    <p>First, how would the pol­icy re­shape job op­por­tu­ni­ties in Sin­ga­pore? A min­i­mum wage by de­sign makes run­ning a busi­ness costlier for em­ploy­ers.</p>
    <p>They will re­spond in three ways: ab­sorb­ing the in­creased costs and per­haps pass­ing some on to end cus­tomers, find­ing sub­sti­tutes (for ex­am­ple, au­toma­tion, for­eign work­ers if they are not cov­ered by the pol­icy, or re­lo­cat­ing to/out­sourc­ing from out­side of Sin­ga­pore), and down­siz­ing their busi­ness.</p>
    <p>How would the ag­gre­ga­tion of these re­sponses im­pact the quan­tity and qual­ity of avail­able jobs for Sin­ga­pore­ans?</p>
    <p>Sec­ond, how would the pol­icy change the work­force par­tic­i­pa­tion?</p>
    <p>A min­i­mum wage will mo­ti­vate more peo­ple to join the work­force or work longer. For in­stance, young Sin­ga­pore­ans (aged 15 to 29), whose un­em­ploy­ment rate, ac­cord­ing to 2018 data, is dou­ble that of those aged 50 and above, may be ac­ti­vated and dis­pro­por­tion­ately more drawn into the work­force by a higher wage.</p>
    <p>Cou­pled with tight­ened job op­por­tu­ni­ties, an in­crease in labour sup­ply will lead to a more com­pet­i­tive labour mar­ket that ought to have win­ners and losers. Who will they be? How much will they win or lose?</p>
    <p>Third, are the pol­icy costs more bur­den­some for the poor or for the rich? At least in the short term, the pol­icy will have costs: prices for some goods may rise a lit­tle, some busi­ness own­ers may earn a lit­tle less, and some jobs may be lost.</p>
    <p>Col­lec­tively, as a wealthy na­tion, we are able and will­ing to bear the costs if this is what it takes to leave no one be­hind. How­ever, we need to es­ti­mate the im­pact by in­come groups to un­der­stand who will shoul­der more bur­dens: real es­tate ty­coons or work­ers who eat their lunch at mixed rice stalls?</p>
    <p>Fourth, is the pol­icy’s long-term im­pact go­ing to be dif­fer­ent from the short-term? The end game for a min­i­mum wage is not to force em­ploy­ers to pay the fair share of value that work­ers pro­duce, but, through pro­mot­ing skill up­grades and pro­duc­tiv­ity im­prove­ment, to en­sure it.</p>
    <p>If the pol­icy works well, the min­i­mum wage con­straint will be­come less bind­ing in the long term and ev­ery­one will ul­ti­mately ben­e­fit from the pos­i­tive sum game. Whether and how soon we can get there de­pends on the pro­jected pro­duc­tiv­ity growth rate and the share of work­ers’ con­tri­bu­tion to the growth, which need to be care­fully mea­sured.</p>
    <p>As an ex­am­ple, sup­pose that a min­i­mum wage en­cour­ages a res­tau­rant owner to adopt a con­veyor belt dish­washer. If, con­se­quently, the kitchen porters are moved up to as­sis­tant chefs who now cre­ate more value, the work­ers will ben­e­fit more in the long run than in the short run.</p>
    <p>If, con­versely, they are down­graded to some­one sim­ply putting dirty plates into the ma­chine and tak­ing cleaned ones out, the op­po­site is true.</p>
    <p>To an­swer these ques­tions, we should ad­min­is­ter ex­ten­sive sur­veys to quan­tify key stake­hold­ers’ re­sponses: work­ers, own­ers of busi­nesses large and small, and those who are cur­rently out of the work­force.</p>
    <p>Since the Govern­ment has im­ple­mented the Pro­gres­sive</p>
    <p>Wage Model (PWM), we should ex­am­ine its per­for­mance us­ing em­ploy­ment data from the se­cu­rity, clean­ing and land­scap­ing sec­tors, where the PWM has raised the min­i­mum wage.</p>
    <p>We should also study the causal out­comes from cases of au­toma­tion/ar­ti­fi­cial in­tel­li­gence adop­tion in low-wage sec­tors.</p>
    <p>If we find en­cour­ag­ing signs from these stud­ies, but re­main con­cerned about whether the ben­e­fits can be gen­er­alised, we should pilot the pol­icy in some sec­tors or for some worker groups to col­lect fur­ther ev­i­dence.</p>
    <p>Our uni­ver­si­ties have some of the world’s top minds in the fields of labour eco­nom­ics and macroe­co­nomics, who are well po­si­tioned to lead the non-par­ti­san re­search. They will, how­ever, need rap­port from both the Govern­ment and pub­lic to de­liver ef­fec­tively. A free in­for­ma­tion Act will lib­er­ate their ac­cess to govern­ment-held em­ploy­ment data, espe­cially those per­tain­ing to PWM. In­sist­ing on hav­ing a ra­tio­nal de­bate will be the pre­req­ui­site for their work to be rightly ap­praised.</p>
    <p>Some may be im­pa­tient for a metic­u­lous na­tion­wide re­search project, which would take one to two years to com­plete. But let us be re­al­is­tic: In the cur­rent po­lit­i­cal cli­mate, ide­o­log­i­cal ar­gu­ments aren’t go­ing to change the course of a ma­jor pub­lic pol­icy any time soon.</p>
    <p>Even with sci­en­tific ev­i­dence at hand, we will still need to have a po­lit­i­cal de­bate over pros and cons. But, at least, that de­bate will be an in­formed one.</p>
