    <p>To­day, as Ger­many marks the 30th an­niver­sary of its re­uni­fi­ca­tion, it is faced with the lin­ger­ing ques­tion of its self-iden­tity and how that af­fects its role in a chang­ing Europe, says global af­fairs correspond­ent Markus Ziener (be­low).</p>
    <p>BERLIN • In Oc­to­ber 1990, while Ger­mans were cel­e­brat­ing re­uni­fi­ca­tion, then Bri­tish Prime Min­is­ter Mar­garet Thatcher and French Pres­i­dent Fran­cois Mit­ter­rand were not happy at all over what they saw.</p>
    <p>Ger­many, a coun­try that in the 20th cen­tury had brought two in­cred­i­bly bloody wars to the world, was whole again. Although ge­o­graph­i­cally smaller than in the past and bur­dened with the task of prop­ping up the for­mer com­mu­nist East, this new Ger­many still re­vived fears that it might yet again be a men­ace to its neigh­bours.</p>
    <p>The year be­fore that, Mrs Thatcher even trav­elled to Moscow in an at­tempt to con­vince then Soviet Pres­i­dent Mikhail Gor­bachev that a united Ger­many was not in the in­ter­est of Europe.</p>
    <p>“We do not want the uni­fi­ca­tion of Ger­many,” she told him in the Krem­lin’s St Cather­ine Hall. “It would lead to changes in the post-war bor­ders that would un­der­mine the sta­bil­ity of the en­tire in­ter­na­tional sit­u­a­tion.”</p>
    <p>But it was too late. Mr Gor­bachev had long ago con­cluded that chang­ing the course of his­tory by force was not an op­tion. His own em­pire crum­bled soon af­ter.</p>
    <p>Mr Mit­ter­rand even­tu­ally bowed to the in­evitable. Mrs Thatcher her­self was out of power shortly af­ter Ger­many’s re­uni­fi­ca­tion on Oct 3, 1990. Only the Amer­i­cans un­der then Pres­i­dent Ge­orge H. W. Bush prag­mat­i­cally sup­ported Ger­many’s de­sire to bring to­gether the two parts of the coun­try.</p>
    <p>Much has hap­pened since, and yet the ques­tion of 1990 is still unanswered: What kind of coun­try is this eco­nomic pow­er­house in the cen­tre of Europe, one that counts more than 80 mil­lion peo­ple? How do you deal with it? Or, as (for­mer US sec­re­tary of state) Henry Kissinger once sum­marised: “Poor old Ger­many. Too big for Europe, too small for the world.”</p>
    <p>THE GOOD EURO­PEANS</p>
    <p>With re­uni­fi­ca­tion, the “Ger­man Ques­tion” was back on the ta­ble. It is a ques­tion asked not just by out­siders but also Ger­mans them­selves. The search for Ger­man iden­tity is a con­stant in the his­tory of the coun­try. Com­ing to­gether as a na­tion state only in 1871, un­der Prus­sian lead­er­ship, the coun­try has pe­ri­od­i­cally un­der­gone pe­ri­ods of self-ex­am­i­na­tion over its iden­tity and place in Europe.</p>
    <p>As it marks 30 years of re­uni­fi­ca­tion to­day, in a world in which old cer­tain­ties and re­la­tion­ships are be­ing shaken up, Ger­many is un­der­go­ing yet an­other of these mo­ments.</p>
    <p>But, first, what are some of the key fea­tures of the world­view of present-day Ger­many?</p>
    <p>One would be a gen­eral aver­sion to­wards a mus­cu­lar, mil­i­taris­tic na­tion­al­ism and flag-wav­ing pa­tri­o­tism, de­spite the re­cent news about neo-Nazi sym­pa­this­ers in its se­cu­rity forces. This view finds ex­pres­sion in a re­luc­tance to step up mil­i­tary spend­ing and en­gag­ing in wars abroad even as a Nato mem­ber. Hav­ing fought wars that left mil­lions dead, Ger­mans have had enough of such mar­tial ac­tiv­i­ties and are largely un­moved by US ac­cu­sa­tions that it is free rid­ing on se­cu­rity mat­ters.</p>
    <p>Post-war gen­er­a­tions in</p>
    <p>Ger­many were also ed­u­cated to be good Euro­peans.</p>
    <p>The po­lit­i­cal goal of fur­ther­ing a com­mon­wealth of like-minded na­tions in Europe, the Euro­pean Union, was even hailed as a ques­tion of war and peace. For­mer chan­cel­lor Hel­mut Kohl once couched it in those terms when he told his coun­try­men that re­lin­quish­ing a part of Ger­many’s sovereignt­y was nec­es­sary for the greater cause of main­tain­ing peace on a con­ti­nent that had seen too many wars. Ger­many’s de­ci­sion in 2002 to give up the D-Mark, its beloved cur­rency, to make way for the euro is to be seen in this light.</p>
    <p>Un­der­ly­ing this pro-Euro­pean idea, how­ever, is still the fear of an all-pow­er­ful Ger­many; that to keep Ger­mans in check, they have to be in­te­grated into a tightly-knit net­work of rules and in­sti­tu­tions.</p>
    <p>West Ger­many’s first post-war chan­cel­lor Kon­rad Ade­nauer even favoured join­ing Nato over the prospect of re­uni­fi­ca­tion. This lack of trust is re­flected as well in the re­marks of Lord Is­may, Nato’s first sec­re­tary-gen­eral. Be­fore as­sum­ing his post in 1952, he bluntly stated Nato’s pur­pose was to “keep the Soviet Union out, the Amer­i­cans in, and the Ger­mans down”.</p>
    <p>NEIN TO FLAG WAV­ING</p>
    <p>The irony of it is that the Ger­mans’ love of the Euro­pean project is not shared by all in Europe. Some neigh­bours even com­plain that</p>
    <p>Ger­many, mostly con­cen­trat­ing on its eco­nomic role, is not show­ing enough po­lit­i­cal lead­er­ship.</p>
    <p>In 2011, Poland’s then For­eign Min­is­ter Radek Siko­rski fa­mously said in a speech in Berlin: “I will prob­a­bly be the first Pol­ish for­eign min­is­ter in his­tory to say so, but here it is: I fear Ger­man power less than I am be­gin­ning to fear Ger­man in­ac­tiv­ity. You’ve be­come Europe’s in­dis­pens­able na­tion.”</p>
    <p>As ex­tra­or­di­nary as this state­ment was – by the min­is­ter of a coun­try that was in­vaded by Ger­many in 1939, in Berlin it still did not res­onate much.</p>
    <p>Ger­many found it­self in a sim­i­lar sit­u­a­tion in 2016 af­ter Mr Don­ald Trump was elected US Pres­i­dent. A few days af­ter the vote, the New York Times ran a story head­lined: As Obama ex­its world stage, An­gela Merkel may be the lib­eral West’s last de­fender. This praise was not well re­ceived in Berlin. Dr Merkel is the com­plete op­po­site of a world saviour, let alone a na­tion­al­ist.</p>
    <p>In 2013, when her CDU party was cel­e­brat­ing its vic­tory in the fed­eral elec­tions, its gen­eral sec­re­tary Her­mann Grohe was seen by Dr Merkel wav­ing the Ger­man flag on stage. She promptly went up to him and snatched the dis­tinc­tive red, black and gold flag out of his hand. The mes­sage was un­mis­tak­ingly clear: As long as she is the chan­cel­lor, there will be no ex­u­ber­ant dis­play of na­tional sym­bols.</p>
    <p>THE DILEMMA</p>
    <p>In a nut­shell, this is what the cur­rent Ger­man dilemma is: For decades, the coun­try fared ex­tremely well by keep­ing a low pro­file po­lit­i­cally while putting all its en­er­gies into eco­nomic growth. While this strat­egy might have worked splen­didly dur­ing the</p>
    <p>Cold War and in the early years af­ter that, it is now giv­ing rise to all sorts of com­pli­ca­tions and con­tra­dic­tions.</p>
    <p>In to­day’s world of a mul­ti­po­lar sys­tem with com­pet­ing cen­tres of power, Europe is one of these cen­tres. Af­ter Brexit, Ger­many to­gether with France are now the two big­gest mem­bers of the EU, and the ex­pec­ta­tion is that Ger­many has to step up to this big­ger role; or at least that is what many of its Euro­pean part­ners say pub­licly.</p>
    <p>And yet it seems that ev­ery time Ger­many does that and as­serts it­self, it gets crit­i­cised for be­ing heed­less of oth­ers. Whether it has to do with its han­dling of the euro cri­sis in 2010, the rad­i­cal change of course of its en­ergy pol­icy fol­low­ing the Fukushima nu­clear dis­as­ter in Ja­pan in 2011 or the mi­gra­tion cri­sis in 2015, Ger­many runs into ac­cu­sa­tions that it is throw­ing its weight around.</p>
    <p>In Athens dur­ing the euro cri­sis, Dr Merkel was de­picted as Adolf Hitler for in­sist­ing on greater fis­cal dis­ci­pline on the part of the Greeks. In parts of East­ern Europe, such as Hun­gary, she was ac­cused of im­pos­ing a moral im­per­a­tive over oth­ers by let­ting in a mil­lion refugees while giv­ing short shrift to their na­tional con­cerns.</p>
    <p>Po­lit­i­cally, re­uni­fi­ca­tion has not made things eas­ier for Ger­many 30 years on. With the US com­mit­ment to Euro­pean se­cu­rity in ques­tion, the coun­try can­not blindly rely any more on its transat­lantic part­ner. It is in fact be­ing asked to as­sume a lead­er­ship role but does it want to, how will it do so and will that be ac­cept­able to its neigh­bours? What kind of coun­try is Ger­many?</p>
    <p>The “Ger­man Ques­tion” is back again, not just for the coun­try but also for the whole of Europe.</p>
