    <p>It was a morn­ing of fun and ac­tion for chil­dren across 250 schools yes­ter­day as they par­tic­i­pated in a vir­tual ob­sta­cle chal­lenge in the fi­nale of Nur­ture Kids, a project un­der</p>
    <p>Sport Sin­ga­pore’s (SportSG) GetAc­tive! Sin­ga­pore pro­gramme.</p>
    <p>Part of the Na­tional Day Ob­ser­vance Cer­e­mony, the kids tack­led the spe­cially de­signed ob­sta­cle chal­lenge by car­ry­ing out tasks such as crab walks and tyre runs in their re­spec­tive pre-schools.</p>
    <p>The event was flagged off by newly ap­pointed Min­is­ter for Cul­ture, Com­mu­nity and Youth Ed­win Tong in his first pub­lic event ap­pear­ance. He said: “Nur­ture Kids gives our kids a head start to a healthy life­style.</p>
    <p>“This year, we are find­ing in­no­va­tive ways to con­nect vir­tu­ally, so that all of us can get ac­tive and cel­e­brate Na­tional Day through sport. Let’s build a strong Sin­ga­pore so­ci­ety that stays healthy to­gether.”</p>
    <p>Since it started in June, the third edi­tion of Nur­ture Kids, which was co-or­gan­ised by SportSG and Ob­sta­cle Course Rac­ing Sin­ga­pore, has en­gaged more than 45,000 chil­dren from over 400 pre-schools.</p>
    <p>This year’s Nur­ture Kids is one of the projects sup­ported by the Ac­tive En­abler Pro­gramme, which of­fers $2 mil­lion in grants to var­i­ous ini­tia­tives that en­cour­age the masses to stay ac­tive while ob­serv­ing safe dis­tanc­ing.</p>
    <p>“It was a good ex­pe­ri­ence for the chil­dren to nur­ture their fun­da­men­tal move­ment skills while hav­ing fun at the same time,” said Thian Ai Ling, gen­eral man­ager of My First Skool and af­ter­school, NTUC First Cam­pus. “While the safety of our chil­dren is of para­mount im­por­tance dur­ing this Covid-19 pe­riod, it is also crit­i­cal for them to stay ac­tive and healthy.”</p>
    <p>To com­mem­o­rate Sin­ga­pore’s 55th birth­day, Mr Tong, SportSG chief ex­ec­u­tive Lim Teck Yin, na­tional ath­letes Jas­mine Goh (ath­let­ics), Shayna Ng (bowl­ing), Calvin Sim (cy­cling), Laura Tan (hockey) and Lu­cas Ng (speed skat­ing), re­cited the pledge and sang the na­tional an­them along­side the preschool­ers in the vir­tual event.</p>
    <p>Mr Tong, Lim and the pre-school­ers also did this year’s GetAc­tive! Sin­ga­pore work­out. As part of this year’s GetAc­tive! Sin­ga­pore cam­paign, Team Nila leader mo­ti­va­tors have been teach­ing vol­un­teers how to do the GetAc­tive work­out vir­tu­ally over Zoom.</p>
    <p>Be­fore the pandemic struck, the lat­est Na­tional Sports Par­tic­i­pa­tion Sur­vey re­sults – among Sin­ga­pore cit­i­zens and per­ma­nent res­i­dents aged 13 and above – showed that the per­cent­age of peo­ple who ex­er­cised reg­u­larly (at least once a week) was 73 per cent in the first quar­ter of the year, an in­crease from last year’s full-year fig­ure of 66 per cent.</p>
    <p>But the num­ber dropped to 55 per cent in April and May when Sin­ga­pore en­tered its cir­cuit breaker phase. Half of those sur­veyed said they re­duced the fre­quency of their work­outs or stopped ow­ing to the clo­sure of sports fa­cil­i­ties and phys­i­cal dis­tanc­ing mea­sures.</p>
