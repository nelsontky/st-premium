    <p>WHERE 02-15 Bukit Merah Cen­tral Food Cen­tre, Block 163 Bukit Merah Cen­tral</p>
    <p>OPEN 5.30am to 2pm, closed on Sun­days and pub­lic hol­i­days</p>
    <p>Make a bee­line for this stall if you like homely fare.</p>
    <p>This is one of a few econ­omy bee­hoon stalls which still make their own ngoh hi­ang in­stead of us­ing fac­tory-bought ones from food sup­pli­ers.</p>
    <p>A queue starts form­ing at 6.30am. The stall of­fers fried or white bee­hoon (both $1), fried noo­dles ($1) and fried kway teow ($1).</p>
    <p>The most pop­u­lar or­der is “yuan yang”, which refers to a com­bi­na­tion of any two types of noo­dles, also priced at $1 for a sin­gle serve. Or­der all four for $2 if you want a sam­pling plat­ter.</p>
    <p>The star dish is the chap chye ($1). Un­like other places where the cab­bage is of­ten ei­ther un­der­cooked or mushy, this stall uses Bei­jing cab­bage, cooked till ten­der with a slight crisp in the cen­tre.</p>
    <p>The ngoh hi­ang ($1.50) is not over-salted and has plenty of crunch from its fill­ing of car­rot, ji­cama and minced pork col­lar mar­i­nated with five-spice pow­der, ground co­rian­der and white pep­per. Stall owner and chef Goh Siew Geok, 66, and her sis­ter Goh Siew Lian, 64, make two batches of ngoh hi­ang a week.</p>
    <p>The fried chicken dumplings ($1 for three; 40 cents for one) are also house­made, us­ing minced chicken breast, plenty of car­rots, ji­cama and spring onion.</p>
    <p>Do not miss out on these crispy pockets packed with veg­eta­bles. Add a sprin­kling of golden crispy squares of mock goose (80 cents) for a touch of in­dul­gence.</p>
    <p>If you are tired of sloppy over­cooked sunny-side-ups, you must try the ones here. Each egg is fried over low heat on a hot plate with just a bit of oil. The re­sult is a smooth egg white and wob­bly yolk with a liq­uid cen­tre. Madam Goh fries only five eggs at a time.</p>
    <p>It is hard to find any flaw in the cooking. The fried noo­dles are sea­soned with a light hand, per­haps not as flavour­ful as I would like, but this is un­sur­pris­ing as the stall is pa­tro­n­ised by many se­niors who pre­fer health­ier fare.</p>
