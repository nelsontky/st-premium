    <p>This year, the world of work changed be­yond recog­ni­tion. In Europe and the United States, more than 40 per cent of the labour force worked from home dur­ing the first wave of the Covid-19 pan­demic.</p>
    <p>In Sin­ga­pore, droves of of­fice work­ers de­serted their high-rise tow­ers in late March and early April and in­stalled them­selves at makeshift desks in their homes.</p>
    <p>Many are still there. As the end of the year ap­proaches, work­place clo­sure mea­sures re­main in ef­fect in most parts of the world.</p>
    <p>Re­mote work­ing has proven to be gen­er­ally pop­u­lar among em­ploy­ees. In a sur­vey con­ducted in the Euro­pean Union in July, al­most 60 per cent of re­spon­dents said they were sat­is­fied with their ex­pe­ri­ence of work­ing from home; 65 per cent said they would like to con­tinue do­ing so at least sev­eral times a month, if given the choice.</p>
    <p>In Sin­ga­pore, eight out of 10 em­ploy­ees pre­fer to work from home or have flex­i­ble work­ing ar­range­ments, ac­cord­ing to a re­cent sur­vey com­mis­sioned by The Straits Times.</p>
    <p>Among em­ploy­ers, re­ac­tions range from mildly scep­ti­cal to un­abashedly sup­port­ive.</p>
    <p>Mr Jamie Di­mon, chief ex­ec­u­tive of­fi­cer of in­vest­ment bank JPMor­gan Chase, not­ing that pro­duc­tiv­ity has fallen, “es­pe­cially on Mon­days and Fri­days”, wants to slowly bring some staff back to the of­fice.</p>
    <p>At Mi­crosoft, ac­cord­ing to re­cently is­sued guid­ance, work­ing from home part of the time is now viewed as “stan­dard” for most roles. Mr Jack Dorsey, CEO of Twit­ter, told em­ploy­ees in May that they would be al­lowed to work from home “for­ever”.</p>
    <p>MON­I­TOR­ING THIS WORK­FORCE</p>
    <p>As work­ers di­vide their time be­tween em­ployer premises, client sites, cof­fee shops, sub­way trains and their homes, how are firms track­ing their per­for­mance and pro­duc­tiv­ity?</p>
    <p>As it turns out, the same in­for­ma­tion and com­mu­ni­ca­tion tech­nolo­gies – the In­ter­net, com­put­ers, mo­bile phones, wear­able de­vices – that make re­mote work­ing pos­si­ble also al­low firms to mon­i­tor their staff.</p>
    <p>In fact, “people an­a­lyt­ics” (as it is called) has been a ma­jor trend in hu­man re­source (HR) man­age­ment for sev­eral years.</p>
    <p>The ob­jec­tive of people an­a­lyt­ics is, to put it sim­ply, to col­lect large amounts of dig­i­tal data about the work­force and trans­form this data into sta­tis­tics, pat­terns, pre­dic­tions and in­sights with the help of com­pu­ta­tional tools that are of­ten re­ferred to as ma­chine learn­ing or ar­ti­fi­cial in­tel­li­gence (AI).</p>
    <p>Data is mined from col­lab­o­ra­tion and pro­duc­tiv­ity ap­pli­ca­tions used within the firm; ag­gre­gated with ge­olo­ca­tion and meta­data from mo­bile de­vices and sen­sors; and fur­ther en­riched with pub­lic in­for­ma­tion har­vested from ex­ter­nal sources, in par­tic­u­lar so­cial me­dia such as Face­book, In­sta­gram, Twit­ter and LinkedIn.</p>
    <p>To il­lus­trate how people an­a­lyt­ics can be ap­plied, let us as­sume that a com­pany wants to mea­sure “em­ployee en­gage­ment”, a term that is beloved by HR pro­fes­sion­als, con­sul­tants and man­agers al­though al­most no­body knows what it means.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to pro­fes­sor of or­gan­i­sa­tional be­hav­iour Wil­liam Kahn, who in­tro­duced the con­cept, people who are en­gaged “em­ploy and ex­press them­selves phys­i­cally, cog­ni­tively and emo­tion­ally” while at work.</p>
    <p>Con­versely, when em­ploy­ees are dis­en­gaged, they with­draw and “un­cou­ple” their selves from work roles. Clearly, com­pa­nies want their work­ers to be en­gaged.</p>
    <p>Tra­di­tion­ally, firms have con­ducted an­nual or bi­en­nial sur­veys in which they ask their em­ploy­ees to rank cer­tain state­ments (such as “My job pro­vides me with a sense of mean­ing and pur­pose”) on a scale from one to five.</p>
    <p>Their an­swers are then ag­gre­gated into a so-called “en­gage­ment score”. Need­less to say, the em­pir­i­cal va­lid­ity of this ap­proach is highly con­tested.</p>
    <p>In con­trast, in the brave new world of people an­a­lyt­ics, al­go­rithms continuous­ly ex­tract and an­a­lyse em­ployee data to in­fer changes and trends in be­hav­iour, at­ti­tude and sen­ti­ment.</p>
    <p>For ex­am­ple, based on sta­tis­ti­cal anal­y­sis of e-mails ex­changed,</p>
    <p>doc­u­ments pro­duced, Web searches, lo­gin times, LinkedIn posts and many other bits and bytes left be­hind in the dig­i­tal data trail, an AI engine may con­clude that an em­ployee has “dis­en­gaged” or is “at risk” of do­ing so.</p>
    <p>HR and man­age­ment are promptly alerted and can take cor­rec­tive or pre-emp­tive ac­tion.</p>
    <p>SUR­VEIL­LANCE CAP­I­TAL­ISM AT WORK</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to a re­cent re­port by con­sult­ing firm McKin­sey, most large or­gan­i­sa­tions use people an­a­lyt­ics; 70 per cent of ex­ec­u­tives view it as a top pri­or­ity.</p>
    <p>As it hap­pens, ex­tract­ing large, un­struc­tured, real-time data</p>
    <p>(“big data”) from users and turn­ing this into ag­gre­gated sta­tis­ti­cal pre­dic­tions that can be sold to ad­ver­tis­ers has been the core busi­ness model of dig­i­tal plat­form com­pa­nies such as Google, Face­book, Ama­zon and Ten­cent for more than 15 years.</p>
    <p>Viewed in this way, people an­a­lyt­ics is just an­other vari­a­tion of what for­mer Har­vard pro­fes­sor</p>
    <p>Shoshana Zuboff calls “sur­veil­lance cap­i­tal­ism”.</p>
    <p>As she de­scribes it in her book The Age Of Sur­veil­lance Cap­i­tal­ism, the ul­ti­mate ob­jec­tive of dig­i­tal plat­forms (or cor­po­rate HR de­part­ments for that mat­ter) is to shape user (or em­ployee) be­hav­iour to­wards max­i­mum prof­itabil­ity and com­pli­ance.</p>
    <p>De­fend­ers point to the sup­posed “neu­tral­ity” and “ra­tio­nal­ity” of data-driven de­ci­sion-mak­ing. Stud­ies have demon­strated, how­ever, that al­go­rithms can in­herit hu­man bi­ases. At its worst, the un­ques­tioned, un­crit­i­cal use of al­go­rithms (for ex­am­ple, in re­cruit­ing, or per­for­mance man­age­ment) can per­pet­u­ate and am­plify the very bi­ases that adopters of AI tech­nol­ogy were hop­ing to erad­i­cate.</p>
    <p>LIM­ITS OF THE LAW</p>
    <p>Can work­ers rely on the law to pro­tect them against seem­ingly lim­it­less sur­veil­lance?</p>
    <p>Le­gal in­stru­ments, such as the Euro­pean Gen­eral Data Pro­tec­tion Reg­u­la­tion (GDPR) and</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore’s Per­sonal Data Pro­tec­tion Act (PDPA), do give some con­trol to in­di­vid­u­als over how their data is used. Both re­quire com­pa­nies to seek con­sent from in­di­vid­u­als to have their per­sonal data pro­cessed for a spe­cific pur­pose.</p>
    <p>How­ever, firms can eas­ily ob­tain con­sent by hav­ing em­ploy­ees and ap­pli­cants sign a “Data Pro­tec­tion Pol­icy”. Fur­ther­more, nei­ther GDPR nor PDPA im­poses sig­nif­i­cant re­stric­tions on the use of ma­chine learn­ing and AI to in­form de­ci­sions about em­ploy­ees. As a re­sult, people an­a­lyt­ics and em­ployee sur­veil­lance, while eth­i­cally ques­tion­able, are (for the most part) per­fectly le­gal.</p>
    <p>What if, in­stead of try­ing to cur­tail the data an­a­lyt­ics prac­tices of em­ploy­ers, we reg­u­late those that op­er­ate the data and AI in­fras­truc­ture through which sur­veil­lance is con­ducted – in other words, big tech­nol­ogy firms? An ex­am­ple of such an at­tempt is a civil law­suit filed by the US Depart­ment of Jus­tice against Google last month.</p>
    <p>An­titrust law in the United States, be­gin­ning with the 1890 Sher­man Act, was crafted to deal with mo­nop­o­lies in clearly de­lin­eated in­dus­tries such as rail trans­port, oil and steel pro­duc­tion, and telecom­mu­ni­ca­tions – not with dig­i­tal plat­forms whose vir­tual sup­ply chains spread across the en­tire world.</p>
    <p>Many, there­fore, ex­pect the Google law­suit to reach a sim­i­lar con­clu­sion as the one brought against Mi­crosoft in 1998: a slap on the wrist, mi­nor changes to busi­ness prac­tices and gov­er­nance struc­ture, and no fur­ther con­se­quences.</p>
    <p>NEED FOR DATA LIT­ER­ACY</p>
    <p>Pri­vacy and an­titrust leg­is­la­tion ev­ery­where seem in­ad­e­quate to rein in large-scale sur­veil­lance and al­go­rith­mic pro­fil­ing by or­gan­i­sa­tions.</p>
    <p>As this year has made clear, most of us de­pend on dig­i­tal tools to work and par­tic­i­pate in so­ci­ety. Through these tools, we pro­duce large amounts of data that can be gar­nered and used by oth­ers to make sta­tis­ti­cal in­fer­ences about us. But even as our ev­ery­day lives be­come in­creas­ingly vis­i­ble to or­gan­i­sa­tions, their sur­veil­lance op­er­a­tions re­main largely in­vis­i­ble to us.</p>
    <p>While people are gen­er­ally aware that in­for­ma­tion is gath­ered about them, most are un­aware of the in­ner work­ings and eco­nomic im­per­a­tives of con­tin­u­ous data ex­trac­tion, ag­gre­ga­tion, pro­fil­ing and mon­i­tor­ing.</p>
    <p>This makes them vul­ner­a­ble to mis­in­for­ma­tion, ma­nip­u­la­tion and psy­cho­log­i­cal harm. What is needed, there­fore, are pol­icy in­ter­ven­tions to build what schol­ars call “crit­i­cal data lit­er­acy”: the abil­ity to recog­nise and crit­i­cally re­flect on the ben­e­fits and risks of data col­lec­tion and ad­vanced an­a­lyt­ics.</p>
    <p>In Sin­ga­pore, ini­tial steps to­wards that goal have been taken with the launch last year of the Dig­i­tal Me­dia and In­for­ma­tion Lit­er­acy Frame­work by the Min­istry of Com­mu­ni­ca­tions and In­for­ma­tion.</p>
    <p>The cur­rent ver­sion of the frame­work cov­ers top­ics such as dig­i­tal advertisin­g, mis­in­for­ma­tion, data pro­tec­tion and cy­ber se­cu­rity. It also briefly ex­plains how al­go­rithms can ex­ploit cog­ni­tive bi­ases to in­flu­ence think­ing and on­line be­hav­iour, but it stops short of ad­dress­ing the wider ram­i­fi­ca­tions of sur­veil­lance cap­i­tal­ism.</p>
    <p>En­dow­ing cit­i­zens with crit­i­cal data lit­er­acy will, in it­self, not do much to re­store the bal­ance of power be­tween those that own the means of cog­ni­tion and those whose be­havioural sur­plus is ex­tracted.</p>
    <p>But, at the very least, it al­lows an in­formed de­bate about the kind of sur­veil­lance tech­nol­ogy we want to ad­mit into our work­places and, by ex­ten­sion, into our lives.</p>
