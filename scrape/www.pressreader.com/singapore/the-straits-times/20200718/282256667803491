    <p>As re­cently as a year ago, many would have chafed at the idea of agri­cul­ture tak­ing a big­ger role in Sin­ga­pore. The on­set of Covid-19 brought to bear the coun­try’s vul­ner­a­bil­ity to es­sen­tial sup­plies be­ing cut off.</p>
    <p>Sci­en­tists are al­ready warn­ing that this coro­n­avirus won’t be the last (An­other coro­n­avirus will hit hu­mans within a decade, warns ex­pert, July 7).</p>
    <p>Should the next coro­n­avirus be more deadly, get­ting lim­ited cross-bor­der sup­plies to con­tinue may hit a road­block as coun­tries and haulage work­ers are seized by fear.</p>
    <p>In the light of this, our aim of at­tain­ing at least 30 per cent food self-suf­fi­ciency by 2030 is a step in the right di­rec­tion.</p>
    <p>To at­tain this and be­yond, we re­ally need to relook the pro­por­tion of land taken up by roads. It seems that our ur­ban plan­ners are road-happy; a huge ma­jor­ity of our build­ings are sur­rounded by roads, and one can ac­cess these build­ings from four dif­fer­ent di­rec­tions. This is a waste of pre­cious land.</p>
    <p>Hav­ing build­ings that are clus­tered together and bet­ter con­nected in­ter­nally will al­low us to do away with the need for di­rect ve­hic­u­lar ac­cess to ev­ery sin­gle build­ing.</p>
    <p>Also, with the build­ing of new roads, some ar­te­rial roads are un­nec­es­sary and the land can be freed up for high-tech food projects.</p>
    <p>Why is there a need for so many con­nect­ing roads in the light of a fall­ing ve­hi­cle pop­u­la­tion, the in­crease in peo­ple work­ing from home and the less­ened de­sire of the young to own cars?</p>
    <p>A case in point is the stretch of Sungei Pung­gol from Sengkang West Bridge to the Tampines Ex­press­way.</p>
    <p>Over a dis­tance of slightly more than a kilo­me­tre, no less than four road bridges run over it. I see from fu­ture plans that an­other road bridge project to cross this sec­tion from Sele­tar Link is in the works. Is this re­ally nec­es­sary?</p>
    <p>In the light of the havoc wrought by Covid-19, let us learn our lessons and po­si­tion our coun­try to bet­ter weather the next pan­demic.</p>
    <p>This calls for go­ing back to the draw­ing board to relook all fu­ture plans – es­pe­cially the amount of land taken up by roads.</p>
