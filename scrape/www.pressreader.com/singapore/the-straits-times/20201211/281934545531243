    <p>The report on the street ven­dors in Waterloo Street brought me back to 1957, when I used to pa­tro­n­ise the In­dian ro­jak stalls in Waterloo Street near the old St Joseph’s In­sti­tu­tion (Waterloo St ven­dors to move into al­lo­cated lots from Jan­uary, Dec 9).</p>
    <p>When the hawker stalls were de­mol­ished, a page in our food cul­ture his­tory was oblit­er­ated.</p>
    <p>Fast for­ward to the present day, with crowds gath­er­ing around the Kwan Im Thong Hood Cho Tem­ple and Sri Kr­ish­nan Tem­ple, rais­ing con­cerns over pub­lic health and safety.</p>
    <p>Many devo­tees visit both temples to pray as some be­lieve that two gods are bet­ter than one. This rep­re­sents a demon­stra­tion of our mul­tira­cial and multi-re­li­gious so­ci­ety where devo­tees show re­spect to gods of other re­li­gions.</p>
    <p>It was re­ported that ven­dors op­er­at­ing along the pedes­trian mall in front of the temples will have to be li­censed to op­er­ate from des­ig­nated lots at a cost of $48.15 a month.</p>
    <p>A num­ber of the ven­dors are el­derly folk, and it would lessen their bur­den if the au­thor­i­ties were to im­pose an in­cre­men­tal charge of, say, $30 for the first year, $40 for the sec­ond year and $48.15 for the third year, and there­after re­view the fee every five years.</p>
    <p>I hope the au­thor­i­ties will also re­serve an area big enough for ice-cream sell­ers, buskers and street ma­gi­cians.</p>
    <p>Buskers, snake charm­ers and other street per­form­ing artists will bring about a live­lier at­mos­phere to the area, which is pop­u­lar with lo­cals and tourists, es­pe­cially dur­ing events such as Christ­mas, Chi­nese New Year, Mid-Au­tumn Fes­ti­val and birth­days of gods.</p>
    <p>Waterloo Street has al­ways been a vi­brant place be­cause of the temples, shops and the nearby food cen­tre. Vis­i­tors like to savour this part of old Sin­ga­pore where dif­fer­ent cul­tures have thrived since the 1950s.</p>
    <p>We would do well to pre­serve our cul­ture for fu­ture gen­er­a­tions.</p>
    <p>Buskers, snake charm­ers and other street per­form­ing artists will bring about a live­lier at­mos­phere to the area, which is pop­u­lar with lo­cals and tourists, es­pe­cially dur­ing events such as Christ­mas, Chi­nese New Year, Mid-Au­tumn Fes­ti­val and birth­days of gods.</p>
