    <p>A to­tal of 22 new Covid-19 cases was an­nounced by the Min­istry of Health (MOH) yes­ter­day, the low­est daily fig­ure in more than five months since March 16, when there were 17 cases.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, sev­eral malls across the is­land – VivoCity, Lucky Plaza, AMK Hub and Paya Le­bar Square – were among the lat­est places vis­ited by in­fec­tious Covid-19 pa­tients, MOH said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Also newly added to the list of lo­ca­tions were Gar­dens by the Bay, the ICA Build­ing, Mustafa Cen­tre and E!Hub @ Down­town East.</p>
    <p>MOH pro­vides the list of places where in­fec­tious Covid-19 pa­tients were for at least 30 min­utes and the time they were there to get peo­ple who were at those places at the same time to mon­i­tor their health closely for two weeks from the date of their visit.</p>
    <p>The full list of lo­ca­tions and times can be found on MOH’s web­site.</p>
    <p>The min­istry has said that close con­tacts would al­ready have been no­ti­fied and there is no need to avoid these places as they would have been cleaned if nec­es­sary.</p>
    <p>Among the 22 new pa­tients was one in the com­mu­nity, who was un­linked as at yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The 35-year-old Bangladesh­i man was de­tected as a re­sult of ros­tered rou­tine test­ing of work­ers in the con­struc­tion, ma­rine and process sec­tors who are stay­ing out­side dor­mi­to­ries. He did not show symp­toms.</p>
    <p>Three im­ported cases were also an­nounced yes­ter­day. All ar­rived in Sin­ga­pore on Aug 26, and were con­firmed pos­i­tive on Sun­day.</p>
    <p>Two of them came from In­dia. One is a per­ma­nent resident, while the other is a de­pen­dant’s pass holder.</p>
    <p>The third pa­tient is a work per­mit holder cur­rently em­ployed in Sin­ga­pore who ar­rived from the Philip­pines.</p>
    <p>All three were serv­ing 14-day stay-home no­tices and were tested while stay­ing at ded­i­cated fa­cil­i­ties.</p>
    <p>Mi­grant work­ers stay­ing in dor­mi­to­ries made up the re­main­ing 18 new coro­n­avirus pa­tients an­nounced yes­ter­day, tak­ing Sin­ga­pore’s to­tal to 57,044.</p>
    <p>Of these, nine had been iden­ti­fied as con­tacts of pre­vi­ous cases, and had al­ready been quar­an­tined to pre­vent fur­ther trans­mis­sion. They were tested dur­ing their quar­an­tine pe­riod.</p>
    <p>The re­main­ing nine cases in dor­mi­to­ries were de­tected through sur­veil­lance test­ing, such as bi­weekly ros­tered rou­tine test­ing of work­ers stay­ing in dor­mi­to­ries.</p>
    <p>No new clus­ters were an­nounced yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The av­er­age num­ber of new daily cases in the com­mu­nity in a week has de­creased from three cases two weeks ago to two in the past week.</p>
    <p>How­ever, the num­ber of un­linked cases in the com­mu­nity in a week has in­creased from a daily av­er­age of one case to two over the same pe­riod.</p>
    <p>With 75 cases dis­charged yes­ter­day, 56,393 pa­tients have fully re­cov­ered from the dis­ease.</p>
    <p>A to­tal of 51 pa­tients re­mained in hos­pi­tal yes­ter­day, with none in in­ten­sive care, while 558 were re­cu­per­at­ing in com­mu­nity fa­cil­i­ties.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore has had 27 deaths from Covid-19 com­pli­ca­tions, while 15 who tested pos­i­tive have died of other causes.</p>
    <p>Glob­ally, the virus out­break, which be­gan in De­cem­ber last year, has in­fected more than 27.1 mil­lion peo­ple, ac­cord­ing to data from Johns Hop­kins Univer­sity. More than 889,000 peo­ple have died.</p>
