    <p>Gold headed for back-to-back gains yesterday fol­low­ing wild swings as in­vestors weighed the out­look for the metal’s record-set­ting rally, track­ing moves in bond yields, a weaker United States dol­lar, as well as an uptick in risk ap­petite.</p>
    <p>Spot bul­lion climbed, while fu­tures were lit­tle changed.</p>
    <p>This comes after prices tum­bled on Tues­day, then swung in a wide arc on Wed­nes­day, as last week’s rally likely spurred some tech­ni­cal sell­ing and profit-tak­ing.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, most Asian stocks ad­vanced yesterday and were on course to erase this year’s de­clines as the global eq­uity rally that has driven shares higher since March con­tin­ued to strengthen.</p>
    <p>Gold and sil­ver have re­sumed their up­trend after the cor­rec­tion and re­main among the best-per­form­ing com­modi­ties this year, aided by neg­a­tive real yields and vast stim­u­lus to com­bat the fall­out from the coro­n­avirus pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Gold­man Sachs Group has de­scribed gold as the cur­rency of last re­sort amid an in­fla­tion threat to</p>
    <p>Gold’s roller-coaster ride is far from over as bond yields will likely re­main volatile for the rest of the sum­mer. The re­lent­less pace higher for gold will mod­er­ate but the out­look still war­rants a strong</p>

    <p>the dol­lar, and fore­cast fur­ther gains above US$2,000 an ounce.</p>
    <p>“Gold’s roller-coaster ride is far from over as bond yields will likely re­main volatile for the rest of the sum­mer,” said Mr Ed­ward Moya, se­nior mar­ket an­a­lyst at Oanda Corp.</p>
    <p>“The re­lent­less pace higher for gold will mod­er­ate but the out­look still war­rants a strong stretch of fresh, record highs.”</p>
    <p>Spot gold traded 1 per cent higher at US$1,935.45 an ounce at 11.54am yesterday in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>On Tues­day, prices dropped 5.7 per cent, the big­gest one-day loss in seven years, fol­low­ing a rally to an all-time high of US$2,075.47 last week.</p>
    <p>Fu­tures for De­cem­ber de­liv­ery de­clined 0.2 per cent to US$1,945.30 on the Comex in New York.</p>
    <p>Sil­ver for im­me­di­ate de­liv­ery rose 1.4 per cent to US$25.8704 an ounce after a 2.9 per cent gain on Wed­nes­day and 15 per cent slump on Tues­day.</p>
    <p>The Bloomberg Dol­lar Spot In­dex dropped for a sec­ond day.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, in­vestors were also weigh­ing com­ments by two se­nior Fed­eral Re­serve of­fi­cials who lamented the US fail­ure to con­trol the coro­n­avirus pan­demic, which stood in poor com­par­i­son with ef­forts in other ad­vanced coun­tries and was un­der­min­ing the na­tion’s eco­nomic re­cov­ery.</p>
