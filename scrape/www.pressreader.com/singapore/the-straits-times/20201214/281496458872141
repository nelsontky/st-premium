    <p>Prime Min­is­ter Lee Hsien Loong will ad­dress the na­tion at 5pm to­day to give an up­date on the Covid-19 sit­u­a­tion and the out­look for next year.</p>
    <p>The co-chairs of the min­is­te­rial task force tack­ling the pan­demic – Health Min­is­ter Gan Kim Yong and Ed­u­ca­tion Min­is­ter Lawrence Wong – will hold a press con­fer­ence im­me­di­ately af­ter, he said in a Face­book post yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>“It’s been some time since my last ad­dress on Covid-19,” PM Lee wrote. “But please stay calm – no need to stock up on any­thing!”</p>
    <p>His speech will be streamed live on his Face­book page, as well as on tele­vi­sion and ra­dio chan­nels.</p>
    <p>Two coro­n­avirus-re­lated top­ics have been mak­ing head­lines in re­cent months.</p>
    <p>The first is the coro­n­avirus vac­cine, with more than 200 vac­cine can­di­dates be­ing de­vel­oped world­wide. Sin­ga­pore has been mon­i­tor­ing the progress of vac­cine de­vel­op­ment and has taken steps to se­cure a port­fo­lio of vac­cines.</p>
    <p>The other hot topic is mov­ing to phase three of re­open­ing.</p>
    <p>Mr Wong has said three con­di­tions must first be met for the coun­try to move to phase three: a 70 per cent TraceTo­gether take-up rate, safe man­age­ment com­pli­ance and suf­fi­cient test­ing ca­pa­bil­i­ties.</p>
    <p>On Fri­day, the Smart Na­tion and Dig­i­tal Govern­ment Of­fice said in a Fo­rum let­ter that “more than 60 per cent” of Sin­ga­pore res­i­dents are cur­rently on the TraceTo­gether pro­gramme.</p>
    <p>Over the course of this year, PM Lee has ad­dressed the na­tion sev­eral times, to lay out Sin­ga­pore’s plan to tackle the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>In his first such ad­dress on Feb 8, he urged Sin­ga­pore­ans to stay res­o­lute in the face of what was then a new and rel­a­tively un­known virus.</p>
    <p>Just over a month later, he warned that more strin­gent mea­sures might have to be taken, as the Covid-19 pan­demic looked set to con­tinue for some time.</p>
    <p>This was fol­lowed by his an­nounce­ment of the cir­cuit breaker on April 3. PM Lee sub­se­quently ad­dressed the na­tion on sev­eral other oc­ca­sions.</p>
