    <p>To tackle the cur­rent eco­nomic chal­lenges, the Gov­ern­ment is look­ing to cre­ate a con­ducive and at­trac­tive en­vi­ron­ment for new busi­nesses to start up and ex­ist­ing com­pa­nies to rein­vent them­selves (S’pore must chart new path as it won’t re­turn to pre-Covid world: Chan, Aug 12).</p>
    <p>We need to re­frame these chal­lenges to un­lock new ideas and find ways to achieve break­throughs for Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>I pro­pose that the Gov­ern­ment con­sol­i­date its ex­ist­ing ef­forts through the set­ting up of a new Min­istry of Dig­i­tal Econ­omy.</p>
    <p>Cur­rent ef­forts to nur­ture start-ups and pro­mote dig­i­tal trans­for­ma­tions are frag­mented.</p>
    <p>Dif­fer­ent gov­ern­ment agencies have been tasked to drive var­i­ous pro­grammes rang­ing from fund­ing sup­port to train­ing.</p>
    <p>But it is not easy for com­pa­nies and in­di­vid­u­als to navigate and make sense of the dif­fer­ent sup­port schemes and mea­sures.</p>
    <p>To en­able tighter co­or­di­na­tion, this new min­istry can con­sol­i­date ex­ist­ing agencies such as the Gov­ern­ment Tech­nol­ogy Agency, the Na­tional Re­search Foun­da­tion and En­ter­prise Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>This will pro­vide new lead­er­ship and im­pe­tus in de­vel­op­ing our dig­i­tal econ­omy.</p>
    <p>A key con­cern of many as­pir­ing en­trepreneur­s is the pos­si­ble drop in or loss of in­come in the first few years of start­ing a busi­ness.</p>
    <p>Through this new min­istry, in­di­vid­u­als can be screened based on their busi­ness pro­pos­als and track records. Suc­cess­ful can­di­dates could be sup­ported with a reg­u­lar salary for the first two years of their busi­ness, sub­jected to reg­u­lar per­for­mance reviews by the min­istry.</p>
    <p>In ad­di­tion, the new min­istry can ac­tively source dif­fer­ent tech­nolo­gies and in­no­va­tive con­cepts, such as those from academia that are yet to be com­mer­cialised.</p>
    <p>It can help to match these promis­ing ideas to the ex­ist­ing large pool of un­em­ployed pro­fes­sion­als, man­agers, ex­ec­u­tives and tech­ni­cians who are highly skilled and keen to start their own busi­ness.</p>
    <p>These are just some ar­eas where the lead­er­ship of the Gov­ern­ment is needed in these press­ing times.</p>
    <p>Noth­ing should be left to chance. Sin­ga­pore is a small city and the abil­ity to har­ness all our avail­able re­sources to de­velop new sprouts of growth is crit­i­cal for our sur­vival.</p>
