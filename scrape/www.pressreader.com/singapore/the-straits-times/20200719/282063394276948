    <p>LON­DON • For a man nick­named “El Loco” (mad man) and with lit­tle sil­ver­ware in his long man­age­rial ca­reer, Marcelo Bielsa is an un­likely hero to a younger gen­er­a­tion of coaches, in­clud­ing Pep Guardi­ola and Mauricio Po­chet­tino.</p>
    <p>But Leeds fans will now treat him with sim­i­lar rev­er­ence af­ter he guided one of English foot­ball’s sleep­ing gi­ants back to the Premier League af­ter a 16-year wait.</p>
    <p>The club, who were cham­pi­ons of Eng­land in 1969, 1974 and 1992, were pro­moted to the top flight on Fri­day af­ter West Bromwich Al­bion’s 2-1 loss at Hud­der­s­field.</p>
    <p>They were able to cel­e­brate pro­mo­tion with­out kick­ing a ball, as sec­ond-placed West Brom’s fail­ure to win guar­an­teed they will fin­ish in the top two with two games left.</p>
    <p>“We are back. Leeds United are Premier League,” the club said on their Twit­ter ac­count moments af­ter the fi­nal whis­tle.</p>
    <p>To add ic­ing on the cake, Leeds (87 points) were crowned cham­pi­ons of the sec­ond-tier Cham­pi­onship af­ter third-placed Brent­ford lost 1-0 at Stoke City in their penul­ti­mate game of the sea­son yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>“It’s still not sunk in,” Leeds cap­tain Liam Cooper said on Fri­day.</p>
    <p>“We’ve been in the dol­drums for 16 years. To lead this team to pro­mo­tion is un­be­liev­able.”</p>
    <p>Ital­ian owner An­drea Radriz­zani will also be toast­ing pro­mo­tion, which is worth an es­ti­mated £170 mil­lion (S$297 mil­lion).</p>
    <p>Mid­fielder Kalvin Phillips saluted Bielsa’s con­tri­bu­tion, say­ing: “When the man­ager first came in, I never thought I would be in this po­si­tion two years down the line.</p>
    <p>“He’s the best i n the world. There’s no man­ager I would rather be un­der than Marcelo Bielsa.”</p>
    <p>Bielsa, the 14th Leeds man­ager since 2004, led the club within touch­ing dis­tance of pro­mo­tion in his first sea­son, but they lost in the play-off semi-fi­nals to Derby.</p>
    <p>For­mer skip­per Do­minic Mat­teo, part of the Leeds side that reached the Cham­pi­ons League semi-fi­nals in 2001, paid tribute to the 64-yearold, who is known for work­ing play­ers so hard in train­ing that they of­ten burn out by the end of the term.</p>
    <p>“What Bielsa has brought to this foot­ball club has been out­stand­ing,” he said. “He’s got a bit of magic and you can see the pas­sion in his body. He brings the best out of ev­ery­one.”</p>
    <p>As soon as pro­mo­tion was con­firmed, Leeds fans gath­ered out­side El­land Road to cel­e­brate, and their emo­tion was un­der­stand­able.</p>
    <p>Leeds are one of Eng­land’s big­gest clubs, reg­u­larly at­tract­ing home crowds of over 30,000 de­spite years of un­der­achieve­ment.</p>
    <p>Their re­turn to the top tier com­pletes a turbulent jour­ney that saw them lan­guish­ing in third-tier obscurity and into ad­min­is­tra­tion, with the fu­ture of the club in doubt.</p>
    <p>They have been away from the Premier League for so long that Twit­ter and In­sta­gram did not ex­ist the last time they played in the topflight in 2004.</p>
    <p>As the club en­ter a new era, it was fit­ting that Liver­pool mid­fielder James Mil­ner, who started his ca­reer at Leeds, tweeted: “Con­grat­u­la­tions LUFC. Back where you be­long.”</p>
