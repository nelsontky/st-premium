    <p>The out­come of the re­cent gen­eral elec­tion was good for Sin­ga­pore, and re­flects a de­sire among Sin­ga­pore­ans for a new bal­ance in pol­i­tics, said Se­nior Min­is­ter Thar­man Shan­mu­garat­nam yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The coun­try’s pol­i­tics has changed per­ma­nently, he said in a Face­book post last night. “We will have to make this new bal­ance work well for Sin­ga­pore.”</p>
    <p>That will hap­pen if there is vig­or­ous and in­formed de­bate be­tween the Peo­ple’s Ac­tion Party (PAP) and the op­po­si­tion on poli­cies, “with both sides treat­ing the other with equa­nim­ity”, he added.</p>
    <p>Mr Thar­man said the re­sults were good for the PAP, as the rul­ing party se­cured a solid man­date with 61.2 per cent of the pop­u­lar vote.</p>
    <p>“Trust in the PAP to run gov­ern­ment and do what is best for Sin­ga­pore­ans is in­tact,” he noted.</p>
    <p>Sec­ond, the 8.7 per­cent­age point swing in vote share from the 69.9 per cent that the PAP se­cured in 2015 – which Mr Thar­man de­scribed as an “un­re­peat­able high” – is lead­ing the party “to re­view its own game so as to win the hearts, and not just the minds, of a chang­ing elec­torate”.</p>
    <p>The Co­or­di­nat­ing Min­is­ter for So­cial Poli­cies said the elec­tion re­sults were also good for op­po­si­tion pol­i­tics, and not merely be­cause they won more votes col­lec­tively.</p>
    <p>“The stronger vote for the WP (Work­ers’ Party) than oth­ers, with its more rea­son­able brand and es­chew­ing of cam­paign­ing around a sin­gle fig­ure, re­flected a dis­cern­ing pub­lic and a po­lit­i­cal cul­ture that bodes well for Sin­ga­pore,” he said.</p>
    <p>He noted that the op­po­si­tion also fielded more can­di­dates who were cred­i­ble in the eyes of the pub­lic.</p>
    <p>While the PAP had a strong cast too, with sev­eral can­di­dates who brought fresh per­spec­tives, the op­po­si­tion ben­e­fited from an­other ma­jor fac­tor, he said.</p>
    <p>Namely, that peo­ple hold the PAP – with its long­stand­ing, dom­i­nant po­si­tion – to dif­fer­ent stan­dards from the op­po­si­tion. “That’s hu­man na­ture,” he said. “It also re­flects a de­sire among Sin­ga­pore­ans for a new bal­ance in pol­i­tics.”</p>
    <p>Mr Thar­man is the sec­ond PAP leader to give his take on the elec­tion re­sults over the week­end, a day after Na­tional De­vel­op­ment Min­is­ter Lawrence Wong shared the party’s pre­lim­i­nary post-mortem with party ac­tivists and the me­dia.</p>
    <p>The Se­nior Min­is­ter said the aim of both the gov­ern­ment of the day and the op­po­si­tion must be to serve Sin­ga­pore­ans’ in­ter­ests through poli­cies that can stand the test of time, “rather than gain pop­u­lar­ity to­day by telling peo­ple what they would like to hear, or promis­ing ben­e­fits with­out re­veal­ing the costs and mak­ing clear who will bear them”.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore has to do more to achieve so­cial justice, he said, but in a way that en­ables it to last.</p>
    <p>It can do so by strength­en­ing so­cial mo­bil­ity, rais­ing the pay of the low­est-in­come work­ers with­out risk­ing un­em­ploy­ment, en­sur­ing mid­dle-aged Sin­ga­pore­ans con­tinue to have good ca­reers, as well as giv­ing greater peace of mind to re­tirees and be­ing able to sus­tain the ben­e­fits for them over time.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore, he added, can never claim to be a model for any­one else in pol­i­tics, as each so­ci­ety moves for­ward out of its own his­tory and so­cial cir­cum­stances.</p>
    <p>There are three key chal­lenges that democ­ra­cies face that the coun­try must ad­dress as well, in a way that re­flects the chang­ing as­pi­ra­tions of Sin­ga­pore­ans, said Mr Thar­man, whose PAP team se­cured 74.6 per cent of the votes in Jurong GRC to de­feat the Red Dot United team.</p>
    <p>First, Sin­ga­pore must be a democ­racy with a strong cen­tre and avoid the po­larised pol­i­tics that many other democ­ra­cies have drifted into, even as its own pol­i­tics gets more con­tested, he said.</p>
    <p>He also stressed the need to keep work­ing to pro­mote mul­tira­cial­ism in so­ci­ety. “That’s al­ready our strength, and it’s what evades most so­ci­eties, but we must strive to build on it in the com­ing years.”</p>
    <p>This must in­clude ef­forts to breed closer in­ter­ac­tions as chil­dren grow up, and re­duce the soft or im­plicit dis­ad­van­tages that mi­nori­ties still face in many work­places.</p>
    <p>“And we must be a more tol­er­ant democ­racy, with greater space for diver­gent views, and a more ac­tive civil so­ci­ety, with­out the pub­lic dis­course be­com­ing di­vi­sive or unsettling the ma­jor­ity,” he added.</p>
    <p>Mr Thar­man said that if Sin­ga­pore can evolve in these ways, they will “help en­sure sta­bil­ity in our democ­racy in the years to come”.</p>
    <p>“And they will tap the en­er­gies and ideas of a younger gen­er­a­tion of Sin­ga­pore­ans and their de­sire to be in­volved in pub­lic af­fairs.”</p>
