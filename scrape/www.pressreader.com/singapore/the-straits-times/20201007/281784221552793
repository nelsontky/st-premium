    <p>Flex­i­ble hours for those who need to be in the of­fice should be con­sid­ered as pub­lic trans­port pas­sen­ger vol­ume climbs with the eas­ing of re­stric­tions at work­places.</p>
    <p>Trans­port Min­is­ter Ong Ye Kung is en­cour­ag­ing em­ploy­ers to al­low staff who are now work­ing from home to start their day in the morn­ing at home.</p>
    <p>They can leave for the of­fice af­ter peak hours, to ar­rive at 10am or later.</p>
    <p>In a Face­book post yes­ter­day, Mr Ong said the num­ber of peo­ple us­ing pub­lic trans­port dropped dras­ti­cally dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker pe­riod in April.</p>
    <p>“To­day, pas­sen­ger vol­ume is about 50 to 60 per cent com­pared to the pre-Covid-19 lev­els, for both peak and off-peak hours,” he added.</p>
    <p>How­ever, he said there is no rea­son to be wor­ried.</p>
    <p>“The trains are much less crowded than be­fore. And we can do our part by keep­ing our masks on, and avoid talk­ing on pub­lic trans­port.”</p>
    <p>He noted that more em­ploy­ers will be re­spond­ing to the Man­power Min­istry’s lat­est guide­lines to have more work­ers re­turn to the work­place.</p>
    <p>Last month, the Gov­ern­ment an­nounced that more peo­ple will be al­lowed to re­turn to the of­fice from Sept 28.</p>
    <p>Work-re­lated events such as meet­ings, train­ing ses­sions, town halls, cor­po­rate re­treats, ten­der brief­ings to ven­dors and business con­fer­ences, as well as on­board­ing or retrenchme­nt ex­er­cises, can be con­ducted.</p>
    <p>How­ever, masks are still re­quired, and so­cial gath­er­ings within and out­side the of­fice are not al­lowed, among other re­stric­tions.</p>
    <p>Mr Ong called on em­ploy­ers not to waste a “rare op­por­tu­nity to change work and travel habits”.</p>
    <p>“Be flex­i­ble with time and place of work. Af­ter all, when we come into the of­fice, it is to meet peo­ple, sign doc­u­ments, use cer­tain equip­ment. And by trav­el­ling off-peak, pub­lic trans­port can bring more peo­ple to and from work, yet (with­out crowd­ing).”</p>
