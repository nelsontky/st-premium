    <p>Be pre­pared for more wet weather in the first two weeks of this month, with tem­per­a­tures drop­ping to as low as 22 deg C on a few days, said the weather­man yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>In a state­ment, the Me­te­o­ro­log­i­cal Ser­vice Sin­ga­pore (MSS) said more thun­dery show­ers are ex­pected over the next two weeks and the daily tem­per­a­ture is fore­cast to range be­tween 24 deg C and 33 deg C.</p>
    <p>The MSS said more rain is ex­pected over Sin­ga­pore be­cause the mon­soon rain band is fore­cast to lie closer to the South-east Asia re­gion.</p>
    <p>“(In the first week of Oc­to­ber), short-du­ra­tion mod­er­ate to heavy thun­dery show­ers are ex­pected be­tween the late morn­ing and af­ter­noon on some days due to strong so­lar heat­ing of land ar­eas,” said the MSS.</p>
    <p>“The show­ers could con­tinue into the evening over some parts of the is­land on a few days.”</p>
    <p>In the sec­ond week of the month, wide­spread mod­er­ate to heavy thun­dery show­ers with oc­ca­sional gusty winds are ex­pected be­tween the pre-dawn hours and morn­ing.</p>
    <p>Thun­dery show­ers are also ex­pected on a few nights.</p>
    <p>On the whole, rainfall for the first two weeks is fore­cast to be above av­er­age over most parts of the is­land.</p>
    <p>Last month was the coolest Septem­ber in the last decade, with a monthly mean tem­per­a­ture of 27.5 deg C, the MSS said.</p>
    <p>It was also the sec­ond-wettest Septem­ber in the last 10 years, af­ter 2013.</p>
    <p>Al­most all parts of the is­land had re­ceived well above-nor­mal rainfall, with Jurong West top­ping the list with 121 per cent above av­er­age rainfall recorded.</p>
    <p>On Sept 22, a halo was ob­served en­cir­cling the sun around noon due to the re­frac­tion of light through ice crys­tals in the high clouds.</p>
