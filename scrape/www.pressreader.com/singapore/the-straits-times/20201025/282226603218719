    <p>LON­DON • Pep Guardi­ola ad­mit­ted he can­not guar­an­tee Manch­ester City will emerge from their slump, af­ter Phil Fo­den came off the bench to res­cue a 1-1 Premier League draw at West Ham yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>City fell be­hind to Michail An­to­nio’s su­perb over­head kick in the first half at the Lon­don Sta­dium.</p>
    <p>Eng­land mid­fielder Fo­den then came on at half-time and pro­duced an in­stant equaliser, but Guardi­ola’s men could not de­liver the knock­out blow and have now won just one of their last four league games.</p>
    <p>Speak­ing to BT Sport, the City boss said: “We started re­ally well. But we suf­fered in the last 10 or 15 min­utes of the first half.</p>
    <p>“In the sec­ond half we were bet­ter and scored early. We had the chances we needed to win the game, but un­for­tu­nately we couldn’t score.</p>
    <p>“We cre­ated enough. Their de­fend­ers were de­fend­ing so deep so it’s dif­fi­cult to find spa­ces, but we had the chances.</p>
    <p>“I’m not a guy who can pre­dict the fu­ture. We’ve al­ready dropped seven points, which is a lot. But we’ve strug­gled a lot for many rea­sons.</p>
    <p>“We have to take things game by game and see what hap­pens.”</p>
    <p>Fo­den was also gut­ted not to have won the match.</p>
    <p>“We would like to get the points to­day, I think we played very well and con­trolled most of the game,” he said.</p>
    <p>“Very dis­ap­pointed to not win the game but we will get over it to­mor­row and im­prove on things for the next game.”</p>
    <p>The 20-year-old equalised in the 51st minute with a sharp near-post fin­ish and City dom­i­nated there­after, but could not find a win­ner with Ra­heem Ster­ling and Riyad Mahrez com­ing the clos­est.</p>
    <p>Adding to Guardi­ola’s prob­lems, Ser­gio Aguero, just back af­ter sev­eral months out fol­low­ing knee surgery, was sub­sti­tuted by Fo­den af­ter suf­fer­ing a “ham­string in­jury”, ac­cord­ing to the City boss.</p>
    <p>He did not know how long his star striker would be side­lined for.</p>
    <p>City, al­ready with­out the in­jured Fer­nand­inho, Aymeric La­porte, Nathan Ake and Gabriel Je­sus, have rarely reached peak form in the lat­est of a grow­ing list of in­con­sis­tent dis­plays.</p>
    <p>While they beat Arse­nal and Porto in their pre­vi­ous two matches, City still do not seem to have com­pletely re­cov­ered from their 5-2 thrash­ing by Le­ices­ter last month.</p>
    <p>They are al­ready five points be­hind lead­ers Ever­ton (13), who play Southamp­ton to­day, and look more vul­ner­a­ble than at any time since</p>
    <p>Guardi­ola’s first sea­son in charge.</p>
    <p>City have eight points af­ter five league matches, and, ac­cord­ing to the BBC, it is the first time a team man­aged by Guardi­ola have failed to reach at least 10 points af­ter five fix­tures of a top-flight cam­paign.</p>
    <p>Tricky trips to Mar­seille in the Cham­pi­ons League and Sh­effield United this week will pro­vide a fur­ther test of just how de­ter­mined City are to re­cover the all-con­quer­ing form that swept them to the ti­tle in 2018 and 2019.</p>
    <p>For West Ham, this was an­other en­cour­ag­ing re­sult, af­ter fight­ing back from 3-0 down at Tot­ten­ham with three goals in the last 10 min­utes in their pre­vi­ous match.</p>
    <p>Ham­mers boss David Moyes was pleased with his side’s per­for­mance, say­ing: “I take a fan­tas­tic point against a re­ally good team. The char­ac­ter the play­ers showed, their at­ti­tude to stick at it.</p>
    <p>“Manch­ester City have come here two of three times re­cently, win­ning by four or five, so to­day’s per­for­mance was much im­proved.</p>
    <p>“I have to say, the way they have played and trained they have been very good.</p>
    <p>“I’m re­ally pleased. It was get­ting tough the way Man City came on at us. I’m re­ally pleased we took a point from the game.”</p>
    <p>UNUSUAL SIT­U­A­TION</p>
    <p>I’m not a guy who can pre­dict the fu­ture. We’ve al­ready dropped seven points, which is a lot. But we’ve strug­gled a lot for many rea­sons.</p>
    <p>PEP GUARDI­OLA, Man City man­ager, at a loss to ex­plain his team’s poor form.</p>
