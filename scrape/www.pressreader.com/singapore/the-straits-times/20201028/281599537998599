    <p>The dis­tri­bu­tion of TraceTo­gether to­kens, which has been on­go­ing at 38 com­mu­nity cen­tres for the past six weeks, has been sus­pended for now so that the to­kens can be dis­trib­uted one con­stituency at a time.</p>
    <p>This is to pre­vent long queues from form­ing at cer­tain com­mu­nity cen­tres, which hap­pened last week­end af­ter the an­nounce­ment that the TraceTo­gether app or to­ken will be re­quired for SafeEn­try check-ins at pop­u­lar venues by end-De­cem­ber.</p>
    <p>The Smart Na­tion and Dig­i­tal Gov­ern­ment Of­fice (SNDGO) yes­ter­day said that the new mode of dis­tri­bu­tion will be­gin to­mor­row, start­ing with Mar­sil­ing Com­mu­nity Club. Com­mu­nity cen­tres in other con­stituen­cies will be pro­gres­sively opened for to­ken col­lec­tion be­tween this month and De­cem­ber.</p>
    <p>By the sec­ond half of De­cem­ber, all com­mu­nity cen­tres will be open for col­lec­tion of to­kens, so res­i­dents who have not taken their to­kens ear­lier can do so then.</p>
    <p>SNDGO said on Mon­day that peo­ple should col­lect TraceTo­gether to­kens only from com­mu­nity cen­tres in their con­stituen­cies, and check­ing in with the TraceTo­gether to­ken or app will be en­forced only af­ter ev­ery­one who needs a to­ken has had a chance to col­lect one.</p>
    <p>“There is no need to col­lect the to­ken if you are al­ready us­ing the TraceTo­gether app or are able to down­load it,” said SNDGO. The to­ken col­lec­tion sched­ule and venues can be found at To­ken.gowhere.gov.sg</p>
    <p>Mean­while, Raf­fles City Shop­ping Cen­tre, Bugis Junc­tion and Ar­cade @ The Capi­tol Kempin­ski were added to the list of places vis­ited by in­fec­tious Covid-19 pa­tients, the Min­istry of Health said.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore also con­firmed seven new coro­n­avirus cases yes­ter­day, tak­ing the to­tal to 57,980.</p>
    <p>The new cases in­cluded one com­mu­nity case, a 28-year-old Viet­namese woman who ar­rived here on an air travel pass on Oct 10. She is a care­giver to her sib­ling who was re­ceiv­ing med­i­cal treat­ment in Sin­ga­pore for a non-Covid-19 con­di­tion.</p>
    <p>The re­main­ing six new cases were im­ported.</p>
