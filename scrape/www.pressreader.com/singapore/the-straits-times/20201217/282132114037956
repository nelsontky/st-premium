    <p>Lawyer Ravi Madasamy, bet­ter known as M. Ravi, was charged in a district court yes­ter­day with crim­i­nal defama­tion.</p>
    <p>The 51-year-old Sin­ga­porean is ac­cused of de­fam­ing Law and Home Af­fairs Min­is­ter K. Shan­mugam in a unit at Peo­ple’s Park Cen­tre around 8.45am on Nov 6.</p>
    <p>Ravi al­legedly posted on Face­book words “con­tain­ing an im­pu­ta­tion” con­cern­ing Mr Shan­mugam, namely that the min­is­ter had claimed that he wields in­flu­ence over and con­trols Chief Jus­tice Sun­daresh Menon.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to court doc­u­ments, Ravi is said to have in­tended for the post to harm Mr Shan­mugam’s rep­u­ta­tion.</p>
    <p>In a state­ment on Nov 7, the po­lice said that in­ves­ti­ga­tions had been car­ried out in re­la­tion to a Face­book en­try that Ravi is ac­cused of post­ing the day be­fore.</p>
    <p>He al­leged in the post that Sin­ga­porean lawyer Eu­gene Thu­raisingam had told him that Mr Shan­mugam had said he “wields in­flu­ence over the Chief Jus­tice” and calls the shots and con­trols the CJ.</p>
    <p>On Nov 6, Mr Thu­raisingam wrote a let­ter to Mr Shan­mugam, say­ing that “there is ab­so­lutely no truth what­so­ever” to Ravi’s al­le­ga­tions. Mr Thu­raisingam also posted a copy of the let­ter on­line on his Face­book page, re­fer­ring to Ravi’s Face­book post as “false and com­pletely un­true”.</p>
    <p>The po­lice added that ac­cord­ing to Mr Thu­raisingam, Ravi had made sim­i­lar ac­cu­sa­tions in a Face­book post pub­lished on June 12, 2017.</p>
    <p>Mr Thu­raisingam clar­i­fied with Mr Shan­mugam on June 13, 2017 that Ravi’s al­le­ga­tions were false. No po­lice ac­tion was taken then. A pre-trial con­fer­ence on the lat­est case is slated for Jan 6 next year.</p>
    <p>Of­fend­ers con­victed of crim­i­nal defama­tion can be jailed for up to two years and fined.</p>
