    <p>Euro­pean coun­tries are strug­gling to avoid a sec­ond lock­down with a sig­nif­i­cant rise in new Covid-19 cases.</p>
    <p>Bri­tain and Spain are among the worst-hit coun­tries, but their lead­ers are against reim­pos­ing a to­tal lock­down. Bri­tish Prime Min­is­ter Boris John­son warned against shut­ting down busi­nesses again, say­ing this would “ruin the econ­omy and di­min­ish our natural im­mu­nity”. His Span­ish coun­ter­part Pe­dro Sanchez in­sisted there were “enough pos­si­bil­i­ties” to turn the cor­ner again.</p>
    <p>Bri­tain is now re­port­ing around 4,000 new cases each day, while Spain ear­lier this week recorded more than 10,000 in a sin­gle day. The sit­u­a­tion is alarm­ing in France as well, with roughly over 13,000 in a day.</p>
    <p>The wors­en­ing sit­u­a­tion fol­lows a rather suc­cess­ful con­tain­ment of the coro­n­avirus, which causes Covid-19, in the sum­mer. On Mon­day, the World Health Or­gan­i­sa­tion (WHO) pub­lished new fig­ures for Europe that showed an 11 per cent in­crease in new in­fec­tions. The WHO’s re­gional emer­gency di­rec­tor for Europe, Dr Dorit Nitzan, de­scribed the sit­u­a­tion as a “wake-up call”.</p>
    <p>The rea­sons for the in­crease are man­i­fold. For one thing, peo­ple are re­turn­ing to work­places af­ter their sum­mer va­ca­tion and are trans­mit­ting the virus. Many have also be­gun to let their guard down, ne­glect­ing per­sonal hy­giene and so­cial dis­tanc­ing mea­sures. The WHO says there is strong in­di­ca­tion that young peo­ple are driv­ing the sec­ond surge on the con­ti­nent. In ad­di­tion, more test­ing is con­tribut­ing to higher num­bers as more cases are de­tected.</p>
    <p>But the test­ing is not be­ing con­ducted in a uni­form man­ner through­out Europe, an is­sue picked up dur­ing a meet­ing of the Ger­man and French health min­is­ters this week.</p>
    <p>While Ger­many has, from the be­gin­ning, adopted pri­ori­tised test­ing, France changed course in July and of­fered free mass test­ing. Against the back­drop of mount­ing in­fec­tion rates, how­ever, it seems that the government in Paris is now con­sid­er­ing re­vers­ing course again. In Ger­many, the goal has been to break the chain of in­fec­tion so those show­ing symp­toms, their con­tacts, re­turn­ing trav­ellers and health per­son­nel are tested first.</p>
    <p>Although the num­bers are slowly ris­ing again, Ger­many is still far­ing com­par­a­tively well when it comes to new cases. Since the on­set of the Covid-19 pan­demic, the coun­try has reg­is­tered around 275,000 cases and slightly more than 9,400 deaths. But an in­crease in some ar­eas has now trig­gered alarm bells.</p>
    <p>In par­tic­u­lar, the Bavar­ian city of Mu­nich is a new hot spot, sur­pass­ing the bench­mark of more than 50 new in­fec­tions per 100,000 in­hab­i­tants over a pe­riod of seven days. If this thresh­old is ex­ceeded, it will be very dif­fi­cult to trace the chain of in­fec­tion. The city ad­min­is­tra­tion now wants to make the wear­ing of masks manda­tory, par­tic­u­larly in crowded ar­eas of the city.</p>
    <p>As an­other pre­cau­tion­ary mea­sure, the fed­eral government is also con­sid­er­ing in­tro­duc­ing a manda­tory five-day quar­an­tine pe­riod for all re­turn­ing trav­ellers. A neg­a­tive test re­sult at the end of the pe­riod will mean the trav­eller need not serve 14 days in quar­an­tine. This new reg­u­la­tion could go into ef­fect in Novem­ber.</p>
