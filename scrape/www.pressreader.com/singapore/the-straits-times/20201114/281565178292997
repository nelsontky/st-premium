    <p>In its largest heroin bust in 19 years, the Cen­tral Nar­cotics Bureau (CNB) seized about 14.15kg of the drug in an op­er­a­tion that also saw of­fi­cers haul in a sig­nif­i­cant cache of other drugs. The to­tal amount seized is es­ti­mated to be worth close to $2 mil­lion. Three men and two women, aged be­tween 29 and 55, were ar­rested.</p>
    <p>In its largest heroin bust in 19 years, the Cen­tral Nar­cotics Bureau (CNB) seized about 14.15kg of the drug in an op­er­a­tion that also saw of­fi­cers haul in a sig­nif­i­cant cache of other drugs.</p>
    <p>In 2001, CNB re­cov­ered 14.9kg of the drug.</p>
    <p>The drug bust on Wed­nes­day also saw about 2.85kg of crys­talline metham­phetamine, also known as Ice, 7.55kg of cannabis, 323g of Ec­stasy frag­ments, 28 Ec­stasy tablets, 1,008 Erimin-5 tablets and cash amount­ing to $12,629 seized from mul­ti­ple lo­ca­tions.</p>
    <p>The to­tal amount seized is es­ti­mated to be worth close to $2 mil­lion.</p>
    <p>Three men and two women, aged be­tween 29 and 55, were ar­rested for their sus­pected in­volve­ment.</p>

    <p>EX­PLOIT­ING SI­T­U­A­TION</p>
    <p>Even with move­ment re­stric­tions due to the Covid-19 si­t­u­a­tion, drug traf­fick­ers are still tak­ing huge gam­bles and ex­ploit­ing the si­t­u­a­tion so they can profit off ad­dic­tion and mis­ery.</p>
    <p>SU­PER­IN­TEN­DENT AARON TANG, CNB’s di­rec­tor of the in­tel­li­gence divi­sion.</p>
    <p>per­in­ten­dent Aaron Tang, CNB’s di­rec­tor of the in­tel­li­gence divi­sion, said: “Even with move­ment re­stric­tions due to the Covid-19 si­t­u­a­tion, drug traf­fick­ers are still tak­ing huge gam­bles and ex­ploit­ing the si­t­u­a­tion so they can profit off ad­dic­tion and mis­ery.”</p>
    <p>The ac­tion started on Wed­nes­day af­ter­noon af­ter CNB of­fi­cers in­ter­cepted a ve­hi­cle near Siglap Road and ar­rested two men, aged 55 and 50, and a 52-year-old woman. All three are Sin­ga­pore­ans.</p>
    <p>In their ve­hi­cle, of­fi­cers found three bun­dles con­tain­ing about 1.45kg of heroin in to­tal.</p>
    <p>The drug busters also found 3g of heroin and 2g of Ice on the 50-year-old man.</p>
    <p>About 7g of Ice and 20 Ec­stasy tablets were on the woman.</p>
    <p>The of­fi­cers then took the woman back to her hide­out near Siglap Road where a to­tal of 11g of heroin, 2g of Ice, one Ec­stasy tablet, and one Erimin-5 tablet were re­cov­ered.</p>
    <p>In a fol­low-up op­er­a­tion the same day, an­other team of CNB of­fi­cers moved in and ar­rested a 35-year-old Sin­ga­porean man af­ter hav­ing ob­served him for some time near a Hous­ing Board block near Be­dok Reservoir Road.</p>
    <p>Six bun­dles con­tain­ing about 2.78kg of heroin, a packet con­tain­ing 127g of Ice, five pack­ets con­tain­ing about 323g of Ec­stasy frag­ments, and $629 in cash were re­cov­ered from him.</p>
    <p>The of­fi­cers raided his flat in the same block where about 8.96kg of heroin, 1.95kg of Ice, 2.5kg of cannabis, 1,007 Erimin-5 tablets, seven Ec­stasy tablets and $12,000 in cash were seized.</p>
    <p>A 29-year-old woman, who is a per­ma­nent res­i­dent, was ar­rested in the unit.</p>
    <p>The 35-year-old man was es­corted to his ve­hi­cle where 944g of heroin, 763g of Ice and 5.05kg of cannabis were re­cov­ered.</p>
    <p>The CNB said in­ves­ti­ga­tions are still on­go­ing.</p>
    <p>The to­tal amount of drugs seized could have, in a week, fed 6,740 heroin abusers, 1,630 Ice abusers and 1,080 cannabis abusers.</p>
    <p>“Th­ese traf­fick­ers will not stop try­ing, but nei­ther will we let our guard down. They will not go un­pun­ished for try­ing to cor­rupt our so­ci­ety with drugs,” said Su­per­in­ten­dent Tang.</p>
    <p>Un­der the Mis­use of Drugs Act, any­one found with more than 15g of di­amor­phine, or pure heroin, could face the death penalty.</p>
