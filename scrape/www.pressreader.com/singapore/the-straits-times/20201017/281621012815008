    <p>Less than seven months back, the Na­tional Wages Coun­cil (NWC) had rec­om­mended that em­ploy­ers af­fected by the Covid-19 pan­demic first re­duce non-wage costs and tap gov­ern­ment help be­fore they move to cut their work­ers’ wages.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, the coun­cil sig­nalled that com­pa­nies could cut their em­ploy­ees’ wages tem­po­rar­ily in or­der to min­imise re­trench­ments.</p>
    <p>The change in NWC’s stance is a sign of and re­sponse to how the pan­demic has taken its toll on the Sin­ga­pore econ­omy.</p>
    <p>The Sin­ga­pore econ­omy shrank by 13.2 per cent on a year-on-year ba­sis in the sec­ond quar­ter of this year. The res­i­dent un­em­ploy­ment rate rose to 4.5 per cent in Au­gust.</p>
    <p>There are some early signs of eco­nomic re­cov­ery, but Deputy Prime Min­is­ter Heng Swee Keat said in Par­lia­ment on Thurs­day: “Even if our GDP (gross do­mes­tic prod­uct) growth fig­ures re­bound, the jobs sit­u­a­tion will re­main chal­leng­ing for some time.”</p>
    <p>With this back­drop, the NWC’s rec­om­men­da­tion ac­knowl­edges that the pan­demic will con­tinue to scar the econ­omy and hurt both com­pa­nies and work­ers.</p>
    <p>NO BLANK CHEQUE</p>
    <p>Even though the coun­cil said that com­pa­nies can cut wages af­ter they have ex­hausted other cost-saving mea­sures, it did not give a blank cheque to em­ploy­ers.</p>
    <p>It has put in at least three safe­guards.</p>
    <p>One, it made it plain that the cuts are tem­po­rary and are to be re­stored when the busi­nesses re­cover.</p>
    <p>Two, it said that em­ploy­ers have to seek em­ploy­ees’ sup­port for the cuts. This means that em­ploy­ers have to ne­go­ti­ate with unions in the case of unionised com­pa­nies, or talk to their staff di­rectly in the case of non-unionised ones.</p>
    <p>Three, it pro­tected low-wage work­ers by rec­om­mend­ing that those earn­ing up to $1,400 in ba­sic wages each month have their wages frozen in­stead of be­ing cut, and that se­nior man­agers take deeper cuts.</p>
    <p>Th­ese safe­guards ought to min­imise the short-term pain for the work­ers who have their wages cut in or­der to pro­tect their jobs in the longer run.</p>
    <p>THREE LIN­GER­ING QUES­TIONS</p>
    <p>De­spite th­ese safe­guards, there are still three key ques­tions on the coun­cil’s lat­est move.</p>
    <p>One, how is the coun­cil go­ing to mon­i­tor whether com­pa­nies are abus­ing the guide­lines? For ex­am­ple, some em­ploy­ers may cut wages when they do not need to do so, or still re­trench work­ers af­ter the pay cuts.</p>
    <p>To this end, unions have to work closely with unionised com­pa­nies, and the Min­istry of Man­power (MOM) has to keep a close watch on all com­pa­nies.</p>
    <p>Em­ploy­ers have to no­tify the min­istry if they cut the monthly pay of their em­ploy­ees by more than 25 per cent. Given the lat­est rec­om­men­da­tions, the no­ti­fi­ca­tion thresh­old ought to be low­ered so that MOM can widen its sur­veil­lance sys­tem.</p>
    <p>The sec­ond ques­tion is: How can the coun­cil en­sure that the wage cuts are re­stored when the econ­omy re­cov­ers?</p>
    <p>Again, it comes down to unions and the MOM keep­ing their eyes on com­pa­nies.</p>
    <p>The work­ers, too, can ap­proach the min­istry for help when they sus­pect that em­ploy­ers are abus­ing the guide­lines.</p>
    <p>The third ques­tion is: What hap­pens if th­ese wage cuts are still not enough to save jobs? The NWC said it con­sid­ered call­ing for a re­duc­tion in em­ploy­ers’ Cen­tral Prov­i­dent Fund (CPF) con­tri­bu­tions, and the con­sen­sus is not to do so. This is a sound move as CPF cuts can af­fect lo­cal work­ers’ sav­ings for re­tire­ment.</p>
    <p>If CPF cuts are off the ta­ble, this means that the coun­cil is al­ready throw­ing all it has into saving jobs.</p>
    <p>The lat­est NWC guide­lines will ap­ply un­til June 30 next year. But crunch time can come much ear­lier. Wage sub­si­dies un­der the Jobs Sup­port Scheme will cover wages paid up to March next year for firms in sec­tors hit harder by the pan­demic, and up to December this year for sec­tors which are manag­ing well.</p>
    <p>Af­ter th­ese two life­lines are re­moved, it re­mains to be seen whether com­pa­nies can con­tinue to stay afloat.</p>
    <p>The lat­est NWC rec­om­men­da­tions will give the firms a bet­ter chance to do so. And if com­pa­nies sur­vive, work­ers keep their jobs, and then both can emerge from the pan­demic scarred but un­de­feated.</p>
