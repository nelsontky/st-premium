    <p>NEW DELHI • In­dian of­fi­cials say China is as­sist­ing rebel groups that have stepped up at­tacks on In­dia’s bor­der with Myan­mar in re­cent months, open­ing an­other front in the con­flict be­tween two na­tions al­ready en­gaged in a deadly stand-off in the Hi­malayas.</p>
    <p>Armed groups in Myan­mar – in­clud­ing the United Wa State Army and the Arakan Army, which was des­ig­nated a ter­ror­ist or­gan­i­sa­tion this year – are act­ing as Bei­jing’s prox­ies by sup­ply­ing weapons and pro­vid­ing hide­outs to in­sur­gent groups in In­dia’s north-east­ern states, ac­cord­ing to In­dian of­fi­cials with knowl­edge of the sit­u­a­tion, who asked not to be iden­ti­fied due to rules on speak­ing with the me­dia.</p>
    <p>The of­fi­cials said mul­ti­ple se­cu­rity agen­cies warned Prime Min­is­ter Naren­dra Modi’s gov­ern­ment that at least four of In­dia’s most wanted in­sur­gent lead­ers were in the south­ern Chi­nese city of Kun­ming to train and source for weapons as re­cently as mid-Oc­to­ber.</p>
    <p>The group – in­clud­ing three eth­nic Naga rebels fight­ing for a sep­a­rate home­land in an area strad­dling the In­dia-Myan­mar bor­der – met act­ing and re­tired Chi­nese mil­i­tary of­fi­cials as well as other mid­dle­men who make up an in­for­mal net­work, the of­fi­cials added.</p>
    <p>On Sept 28, In­dian bor­der guards in­ter­cepted a large cache of weapons meant for In­dian in­sur­gent groups along the In­di­aMyan­mar bor­der and ar­rested three sus­pected gun­run­ners.</p>
    <p>The in­creased ac­tiv­ity along the Myan­mar bor­der has sparked con­cern in New Delhi that In­dia’s mil­i­tary is be­com­ing stretched, as ten­sions per­sist with China and Pak­istan along other parts of its roughly 14,000km land bor­der.</p>
    <p>The of­fi­cials said In­dia moved sev­eral bat­tal­ions of about 1,000 troops each into the Myan­mar bor­der area af­ter a sol­dier was killed in an am­bush on Oct 21.</p>
    <p>In late Oc­to­ber, In­dian and Myan­mar troops launched joint op­er­a­tions tar­get­ing In­dian rebel groups, in­clud­ing one named the Peo­ple’s Lib­er­a­tion Army of Ma­nipur.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, Myan­mar’s mil­i­tary has tar­geted armed eth­nic groups, such as the Arakan Army, on its side of the bor­der.</p>
    <p>In­dia’s army chief trav­elled to Na­ga­land on Nov 24 for a three­day visit, un­der­scor­ing the re­newed in­ten­sity of the con­flict.</p>
    <p>China’s For­eign Min­istry de­nied claims that the coun­try was sup­port­ing armed groups against In­dia, say­ing it does not in­ter­fere in the af­fairs of other coun­tries.</p>
    <p>“China has al­ways taken a pru­dent and re­spon­si­ble at­ti­tude to­ward arms ex­ports,” the min­istry said in writ­ten re­sponses to ques­tions.</p>
    <p>“We only con­duct mil­i­tary trade in co­op­er­a­tion with sov­er­eign states and do not sell arms to non-state ac­tors.”</p>
    <p>The United Wa State Army also de­nied a role in pro­vid­ing any aid or sup­port to In­dian rebel groups on China’s be­half, cit­ing – among other fac­tors – the over 804km dis­tance be­tween their head­quar­ters and the In­dia-Myan­mar bor­der.</p>
    <p>Sev­eral dozen armed mili­tias are ac­tive in In­dia’s north-east, fight­ing for in­de­pen­dence or greater au­ton­omy.</p>
    <p>In­dian of­fi­cials said the re­cent up­surge in vi­o­lence goes back to Septem­ber, when Naga in­sur­gents walked away from decades-long peace ne­go­ti­a­tions.</p>
    <p>Asked by reporters on Nov 6 whether China was us­ing armed eth­nic groups in Myan­mar to sup­port In­dian rebels, a se­nior In­dian Home Min­istry of­fi­cial de­clined to an­swer di­rectly.</p>
    <p>“Some of the in­sur­gent groups are trou­ble­mak­ers, but we are ne­go­ti­at­ing peace with oth­ers,” Mr Ajay Bhalla, a top bu­reau­crat at the Home Min­istry, said at a we­bi­nar hosted by the Na­tional De­fence Col­lege.</p>
    <p>Both In­dia and China are in­vest­ing in Myan­mar for strate­gic rea­sons.</p>
    <p>“China knows that the re­gion is cru­cial to In­dia’s fu­ture con­nec­tiv­ity into South-east Asia,” said pro­fes­sor of in­ter­na­tional re­la­tions Ian Hall of Grif­fith Univer­sity in Queens­land, Aus­tralia, and author of Modi And The Rein­ven­tion Of In­dian For­eign Pol­icy.</p>
    <p>“It knows too that se­cur­ing the re­gion is chal­leng­ing and has been very costly to New Delhi in the past.”</p>
    <p>The of­fi­cials said mul­ti­ple se­cu­rity agen­cies warned Prime Min­is­ter Naren­dra Modi’s gov­ern­ment that at least four of In­dia’s most wanted in­sur­gent lead­ers were in the south­ern Chi­nese city of Kun­ming to train and source for weapons as re­cently as mid-Oc­to­ber.</p>
