    <p>News broke last month that a Chi­nese com­pany with links to China’s Min­istry of State Se­cu­rity has been se­cretly data-pro­fil­ing at least 35,000 prom­i­nent Aus­tralians. A leak re­vealed that the com­pany, Zhen­hua Data, has com­piled records on at least</p>
    <p>2.4 mil­lion peo­ple of “spe­cial in­ter­est” to China world­wide.</p>
    <p>The op­er­a­tion has “scraped” open-source ma­te­rial from so­cial me­dia as well as used con­fi­den­tial bank records, job ap­pli­ca­tions and psy­cho­log­i­cal pro­files prob­a­bly ob­tained from the Dark Web.</p>
    <p>De­fence ex­perts warn of a likely in­ten­tion to “ex­ploit and ma­nip­u­late” in­di­vid­u­als with the in­for­ma­tion.</p>
    <p>The con­spic­u­ous Aus­tralian re­sponse to this gross vi­o­la­tion of na­tional pri­vacy has been... “meh”.</p>
    <p>Rather than right­eous hor­ror, nov­el­ist John Birm­ing­ham ex­pressed aloud on Twit­ter the silent anx­i­ety of many Aus­tralians: Not be­ing con­sid­ered prom­i­nent enough for pro­fil­ing. The news­pa­per The Aus­tralian Fi­nan­cial Re­view cor­rectly read the na­tional room with the headline “If you’re not on the Zhen­hua database, don’t be of­fended”.</p>
    <p>Frus­trat­ing re­ports of­fered a mere hand­ful of names: com­pany di­rec­tors, politi­cians, judges, and de­fence and tech­nol­ogy peo­ple. Aca­demics. Some lo­cal crim­i­nals. And, uh, ’90s pop star Natalie Im­bruglia.</p>
    <p>Aus­tralians are not en­tirely blase about the im­pli­ca­tions of the leak. The na­tional broad­caster, the ABC, re­ported that Zhen­hua Data chief ex­ec­u­tive Wang Xue­feng has used the Chi­nese so­cial me­dia app WeChat “to en­dorse wag­ing ‘hy­brid war­fare’” through ma­nip­u­la­tion of pub­lic opin­ion and other “psy­cho­log­i­cal” op­er­a­tions.</p>
    <p>Con­cern is war­ranted that Zhen­hua Data has pro­filed the chil­dren of prom­i­nent ci­ti­zens, as well as their part­ners and relatives, with pho­to­graphs, news ar­ti­cles and crim­i­nal his­to­ries. The risk of on­line im­per­son­ations, deep fakes and other dis­tress­ing forms of dis­in­for­ma­tion at­tack is real.</p>
    <p>But one must sug­gest, po­litely, that if the in­tent of au­thor­i­tar­ian China is to ex­ert some kind of kom­pro­mat-style in­flu­ence over Aus­tralians to black­mail them with their per­sonal in­for­ma­tion, its in­vest­ment may reap more re­turns else­where.</p>
    <p>It is not that we Aus­tralians are too holy to en­gage in wrong­do­ing, tell lies or make moral catas­tro­phes of our pri­vate lives. It’s just that we strug­gle, as a peo­ple, to shame one another for it.</p>
    <p>An im­por­tant dif­fer­ence be­tween Aus­tralia and many other coun­tries is that we hardly ex­pect our po­lit­i­cal lead­ers and pub­lic fig­ures to be morally su­pe­rior to our­selves. And it’s left us pro­foundly – and po­lit­i­cally – un­in­ter­ested in their pri­vate lives.</p>
    <p>In the 1960s, a prime min­is­ter lit­er­ally van­ished into the sea when he went swim­ming with his sus­pected mis­tress, and her pres­ence there barely rates a his­tor­i­cal note. Back in 1972, we had a state premier noted for “flam­boy­ance” at a time when the word was still a eu­phemism. At least two prime min­is­ters strug­gled with known ad­dic­tion. In 2018, the deputy prime min­is­ter got a girl­friend preg­nant and it was mostly news be­cause the wo­man was in his tax­payer-funded em­ploy. He was hand­somely re-elected; new mother, baby and ex-wife do­ing well.</p>
    <p>Twenty years be­fore mar­riage equal­ity, po­lit­i­cal smears against a gay judge on Aus­tralia’s high­est court re­sulted in “up­roar” from the le­gal pro­fes­sion, the Se­nate and a so­ci­ety un­will­ing to val­i­date a “cul­ture of prej­u­dice”. Aus­tralian pop star Kylie Minogue had an af­fair with a very mar­ried Jean-Claude Van Damme, and Aus­tralians were more cu­ri­ous about his bal­let rou­tines for her butt.</p>
    <p>There have been decades of con­scious so­cial des­tig­ma­ti­sa­tion – of di­vorce, abor­tion, sex work, men­tal ill­ness, sex­ual ex­pres­sion and ad­dic­tion – in cam­paigns and leg­is­la­tion.</p>
    <p>In Aus­tralia, a leader ad­mit­ting to pri­vate strug­gle is more likely to pro­voke the sud­den ap­pear­ance of a sym­pa­thetic doc­u­men­tary crew than any per­ma­nent loss of sta­tus. It takes pub­licly uri­nat­ing into your own mouth or sim­u­lat­ing sex acts with dogs to end a foot­ball ca­reer.</p>
    <p>Aus­tralians’ for­giv­ing egal­i­tar­i­an­ism is some­thing that more hi­er­ar­chi­cal so­ci­eties may not grasp. Gen­er­a­tions of mi­grants and refugees ar­rived here en­thu­si­as­tic for sanc­tu­ary and op­por­tu­nity. Com­bined, you get what Aus­tralian in­tel­lec­tual Don­ald Horne de­scribed in his sem­i­nal 1964 book,</p>
    <p>The Lucky Coun­try, an over­whelm­ing cul­tural be­lief that “ev­ery­one has the right to a good time”.</p>
    <p>When that “good time” is threat­ened by crime – sex­ual mis­con­duct, say, or malfea­sance – pop­u­lar lack of in­ter­est trans­forms into blood­thirsty pub­lic hunger for jus­tice. Of late, ex­posed cor­rup­tion ends a po­lit­i­cal ca­reer within a day.</p>
    <p>So maybe the Chi­nese pro­fil­ers are try­ing to build lever­age over peo­ple by gath­er­ing ev­i­dence of crim­i­nal­ity? If so, it’s worth re­mind­ing them that democ­ra­cies like Aus­tralia cre­ate trans­par­ent sys­tems of mon­i­tor­ing and ac­count­abil­ity – and re­tain a free press – so we can root out crim­i­nals for our­selves.</p>
    <p>What­ever can be scraped and gath­ered by a Chi­nese com­pany on­line can – should, must – be done by jour­nal­ists and in­ves­ti­ga­tors with ac­cess to re­sources.</p>
    <p>For­eign agen­cies can­not ma­nip­u­late crim­i­nals when com­mu­ni­ties main­tain the tools to ex­pose them. If there is a re­laxed tone in the Aus­tralian re­sponse to the Chi­nese pro­fil­ing, it is be­cause weapon­is­ing shame does not work on the shame­less.</p>
    <p>The data of se­crets does not work if ev­ery­one knows what they are. In a new world of “in­for­ma­tion war”, lib­eral democ­ra­cies have built-in de­fences to ma­nip­u­la­tion by au­thor­i­tar­ian states. Non-judg­men­tal so­cial pol­icy. An in­de­pen­dent press. Trans­par­ent, rig­or­ous sys­tems of over­sight. You know – the defin­ing tra­di­tions of lib­eral democ­racy.</p>
