    <p>All dor­mi­to­ries were de­clared to be clear of Covid-19 as of yes­ter­day, in­clud­ing the stand­alone blocks in pur­pose-built dor­mi­to­ries that served as iso­la­tion or quar­an­tine fa­cil­i­ties.</p>
    <p>“All res­i­dents in the stand­alone blocks have ei­ther com­pleted their iso­la­tion or quar­an­tine, or been moved to other govern­ment fa­cil­i­ties de­pend­ing on their health sta­tus,” said the Min­istry of Man­power (MOM).</p>
    <p>Around 333,000 for­eign work­ers in the con­struc­tion, marine and process sec­tors, or 86 per cent of them, have been al­lowed to re­sume work. This is up from the 81 per cent an­nounced last week.</p>
    <p>They have been given the Green Ac­cessCode, which al­lows them to re­sume work.</p>
    <p>The min­istry said it ex­pects an ad­di­tional 20,000 res­i­dents from re­cently cleared dor­mi­to­ries to have the Green Ac­cessCode soon, after their dor­mi­to­ries have com­pleted the nec­es­sary prepa­ra­tions.</p>
    <p>“Half of these res­i­dents cur­rently have Red Ac­cessCode, as their ad­dresses are not up­dated. Re­minders will be sent to dor­mi­tory op­er­a­tors and em­ploy­ers to up­date work­ers’ ad­dresses ac­cord­ingly,” it added.</p>
    <p>Go­ing for­ward, MOM said it ex­pects that there will al­ways be a pro­por­tion of work­ers with Red Ac­cessCode, which pre­cludes them from go­ing to work.</p>
    <p>This can be due to sev­eral rea­sons, such as test­ing pos­i­tive for Covid-19 or be­ing quar­an­tined fol­low­ing close con­tact with an in­fected per­son.</p>
    <p>Work­ers may also have the Red Ac­cessCode if they are placed on pre­cau­tion­ary quar­an­tine while their ex­po­sure to a pos­i­tive case is be­ing in­ves­ti­gated, if they no longer have the TraceTo­gether app in­stalled on their mo­bile de­vice,</p>
    <p>Pro­por­tion of for­eign work­ers in the con­struc­tion, marine and process sec­tors who have been al­lowed back to work. or if they are re­quired to un­dergo ros­tered rou­tine test­ing but did not do so.</p>
    <p>With the com­ple­tion of the dor­mi­tory clear­ance process, MOM said it has adopted a mul­ti­lay­ered strat­egy to pre­vent a se­cond wave of in­fec­tions in the cleared dor­mi­to­ries.</p>
    <p>This in­cludes group­ing mi­grant work­ers in dor­mi­to­ries by the type of in­dus­try they are in and im­ple­ment­ing safe dis­tanc­ing mea­sures.</p>
    <p>Once a new case is de­tected, con­tact trac­ing ef­forts will be­gin.</p>
    <p>“Sec­tor agen­cies will work closely with the em­ploy­ers to as­sess the risk at the work­places and put in place safety time­outs if nec­es­sary,” said MOM.</p>
    <p>Once im­me­di­ate close con­tacts of pos­i­tive mi­grant work­ers are iden­ti­fied, they will un­dergo a 14-day quar­an­tine at a ded­i­cated fa­cil­ity.</p>
    <p>Other close con­tacts will be quar­an­tined in their dor­mi­to­ries and will un­dergo tests to en­sure that they are cleared of the virus be­fore they are al­lowed to re­turn to work.</p>
    <p>MOM said the new in­fec­tion cases in cleared dor­mi­to­ries and tem­po­rary hold­ing sites are a re­minder of the need to be vig­i­lant.</p>
    <p>MOM added that its pri­or­ity will be to pre­vent and ar­rest new in­fec­tions through early de­tec­tion, timely con­tain­ment and ef­fec­tive iso­la­tion.</p>
