    <p>Given the lim­ited size of the lo­cal work­force and the per­pet­u­ally tight labour mar­ket, the re­al­ity is that Sin­ga­pore­ans will have to ac­cept for­eign­ers in their midst, MPs ac­knowl­edged in Par­lia­ment last week. But they urged the Govern­ment to do more to help Sin­ga­pore­ans level up and to pro­tect the Sin­ga­porean core.</p>
    <p>Some MPs sug­gested that more data needed to be col­lected and re­leased for both the author­i­ties and the peo­ple to get a bet­ter han­dle on the is­sue, and for dis­cus­sions to gen­er­ate more light than heat.</p>
    <p>De­spite a tight­en­ing of the rules on em­ploy­ment passes over the years, there con­tin­ues to be dis­con­tent over the hot-but­ton is­sue.</p>
    <p>Em­ploy­ers from small and medium-sized en­ter­prises to large multi­na­tional cor­po­ra­tions also lament the dif­fi­culty of hir­ing suit­ably skilled staff with the right at­ti­tude, while job seek­ers say that they are passed over for cheaper for­eign­ers who are will­ing to do more for less. It sug­gests a dis­con­nect be­tween the sta­tis­tics, and what busi­nesses and Sin­ga­pore­ans are ex­pe­ri­enc­ing on the ground.</p>
    <p>Leader of the Op­po­si­tion and Work­ers’ Party chief Pri­tam Singh sug­gested set­ting up a se­lect com­mit­tee to “in­ves­ti­gate the lim­i­ta­tions of the work­force and the needs of the econ­omy on the one hand, and the re­al­ity of the Sin­ga­porean worker in the face of com­pe­ti­tion and the con­straints faced by em­ploy­ers on the other”.</p>
    <p>The Alju­nied GRC MP wel­comed the re­cent clarificat­ions by Trade and In­dus­try Min­is­ter Chan Chun Sing on the is­sue of in­ter-cor­po­rate trans­fers, a pol­icy which al­lows some com­pa­nies to trans­fer staff from their over­seas to Sin­ga­pore of­fices and has sparked con­cerns of com­pa­nies gam­ing the sys­tem. “To this end, more in­for­ma­tion, and not less, is cer­tainly most help­ful,” he said.</p>
    <p>On the other side of the aisle, Ke­bun Baru MP Henry Kwek and West Coast GRC MP Ang Wei Neng sug­gested col­lect­ing yet more data and mak­ing it pub­lic.</p>
    <p>Mr Kwek said com­pa­nies with at least 200 em­ploy­ees of which 25 per cent are EP hold­ers should be re­quired to de­clare where their for­eign pro­fes­sion­als come from along sev­eral wage bands. This will show if there is an un­healthy con­cen­tra­tion of such pro­fes­sion­als, he said. Mr Ang, mean­while, said a Na­tional Hu­man Re­sources Com­mit­tee should be set up to gather and pub­lish data about pro­fes­sion­als, man­agers, ex­ec­u­tives and tech­ni­cians at work­places, so any prob­lems can be de­tected early.</p>
    <p>FIND­ING AN­SWERS</p>
    <p>As­so­ciate pro­fes­sor of eco­nomics Wal­ter Th­e­seira from the Sin­ga­pore Univer­sity of So­cial Sciences said the best way to find an­swers on ac­tual dis­crim­i­na­tion is to look at man­power records at dif­fer­ent com­pa­nies and sin­gle out those where dis­tri­bu­tion is sta­tis­ti­cally un­usual.</p>
    <p>“If for­eign work­ers and lo­cals are ran­domly distribute­d across firms, it will be un­usual and po­ten­tially sus­pi­cious for any one firm to have a pro­por­tion of work­ers greatly dif­fer­ent from that of the gen­eral labour force. But you can­not tell with­out look­ing deeper to see if that’s be­cause of dis­crim­i­na­tion or lack of lo­cal skill sets,” he said.</p>
    <p>He sug­gested that the Govern­ment col­lect data on the dis­tri­bu­tion of for­eign pro­fes­sion­als and Sin­ga­pore­ans by in­dus­try and make it pub­licly avail­able so re­searchers can also con­trib­ute to ex­am­in­ing the is­sue.</p>
    <p>In the mean­time, MPs asked the Govern­ment to boost pro­fes­sional train­ing schemes for Sin­ga­pore­ans to plug the skills gap so they can take on the jobs in the fi­nan­cial ser­vices and info-com­mu­ni­ca­tions tech­nol­ogy sec­tors now held by for­eign­ers.</p>
    <p>Some sug­gested that train­ing schemes tied to the in­dus­try trans­for­ma­tion maps which are be­ing rolled out to help var­i­ous sec­tors trans­form for the fu­ture econ­omy can also bet­ter pre­pare Sin­ga­pore­ans for the pro­fes­sional jobs in the pipe­line.</p>
    <p>Prof Th­e­seira reck­oned that this would help to solve part of the prob­lem, but sug­gested that there should be a dif­fer­en­ti­a­tion be­tween jobs that are eas­ier to train for and jobs that would re­quire a strong com­bi­na­tion of train­ing as well as un­der­ly­ing tal­ent.</p>
    <p>Some, like West Coast GRC MP Foo Mee Har, won­dered if it was per­haps time for Sin­ga­pore to in­tro­duce a Sin­ga­porean-first em­ploy­ment pol­icy, where Sin­ga­pore­ans are given pri­or­ity and not merely fair con­sid­er­a­tion by em­ploy­ers. As a banker, she had seen coun­tries like Canada de­ploy such mea­sures, she said.</p>
    <p>But there were oth­ers who warned that this could re­sult in jobs be­ing filled by peo­ple who were not the most suit­able.</p>
    <p>Another de­vel­op­ment may also change the way this is­sue is viewed go­ing for­ward, said Radin Mas MP Melvin Yong, not­ing that the Covid-19 cri­sis, which has forced bil­lions around the world to work from home, has up­ended the be­lief that peo­ple have to work from a par­tic­u­lar lo­ca­tion or of­fice. Sin­ga­pore­ans who were based over­seas had re­turned home around March when out­breaks in other coun­tries started to pick up speed, and many have con­tin­ued work­ing in their jobs from their homes in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>With the ad­vance­ment of 5G tech­nol­ogy ex­pand­ing re­mote work­ing pos­si­bil­i­ties even more, com­pe­ti­tion for jobs will truly be­come glob­alised, blur­ring the di­vide be­tween the lo­cal and for­eign work­force, said Mr Yong. “Will our Work Pass and Em­ploy­ment Pass sys­tem con­tinue to be rel­e­vant when com­pa­nies no longer need em­ploy­ees to be phys­i­cally based in one lo­ca­tion to per­form the work?” he asked.</p>
    <p>Another as­sump­tion that could per­haps be ex­am­ined is the one about for­eign em­ploy­ment ex­pand­ing the eco­nomic pie. From an eco­nomic point of view, the as­sump­tion is sen­si­ble, said Prof Th­e­seira, but more re­search is needed to see if it ap­plies to all in­dus­tries. He added that the pub­lic may not al­ways see a big­ger pie as be­ing good enough in it­self, even if their ab­so­lute share in­creases. “What we are re­ally ar­gu­ing about is how big of an eco­nomic pie do we have ver­sus how do we dis­trib­ute that pie,” he said.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing the de­bate last week, MPs and min­is­ters who spoke agreed that Sin­ga­pore should not turn in­wards the way many coun­tries have done amid do­mes­tic pres­sure to pro­tect work­ers.</p>
    <p>As Prime Min­is­ter Lee Hsien Loong noted, Sin­ga­pore as an open port and im­mi­grant na­tion has al­ways been open to the world and wel­com­ing to oth­ers who add value to its so­ci­ety.</p>
    <p>He said: “We may be un­der stress now, but we can­not af­ford to turn in­wards. We will ad­just our poli­cies to safe­guard Sin­ga­porean jobs, but let us show con­fi­dence that Sin­ga­pore­ans can hold our own in the world.”</p>
