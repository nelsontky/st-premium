    <p>By luck and de­sign, Mr Joe Bi­den’s United States pres­i­den­tial cam­paign could not have gone bet­ter.</p>
    <p>The former vice-pres­i­dent’s wrap­ping up the party nom­i­na­tion ear­lier and more eas­ily than ex­pected, cou­pled with an in­clu­sive pol­icy devel­op­ment process, avoids a re­peat of 2016 and its jar­ring lib­eral-ver­sus-mod­er­ate fac­tional clash at the con­ven­tion and be­yond.</p>
    <p>Then, Mr Bi­den aced his choice of run­ning mate. The nom­i­na­tion of Se­na­tor Ka­mala Har­ris in­creased his ap­peal with the key vot­ing de­mo­graph­ics of women, African Amer­i­cans and In­dian Amer­i­cans with­out alien­at­ing any of his ex­ist­ing sup­port.</p>
    <p>His glitch-free roll-out of his run­ning mate also ex­tin­guished any crit­i­cism that flowed from im­pa­tience with the seem­ingly drawn-out se­lec­tion process.</p>
    <p>Though it is near im­pos­si­ble to de­ci­pher Pres­i­dent Don­ald</p>
    <p>Trump’s re­flex­ive in­sults and base­less ad hominem attacks, his end­less blovi­at­ing about Ms Har­ris seems as much an ad­mis­sion that her ad­di­tion to the Demo­cratic ticket is viewed as a threat.</p>
    <p>Now, it turns out that a coro­n­avirus-con­strained con­ven­tion most likely works in Mr Bi­den’s favour as well.</p>
    <p>Although the speeches this year will be on video, miss­ing out on the buzz of a live event in a packed hall, there will be a di­verse and stel­lar cast of speak­ers to mo­ti­vate the base ahead of Mr Bi­den’s ac­cep­tance speech from Wilm­ing­ton, Delaware, on Thurs­day.</p>
    <p>They in­clude former US pres­i­dent Barack Obama and his wife Michelle, Se­na­tor Bernie San­ders, ris­ing pro­gres­sive star Alexan­dria Oca­sio-Cortez (bet­ter known as AOC) and even a Repub­li­can, former Ohio gover­nor John Ka­sich.</p>
    <p>A vir­tual event sans bal­loons, con­fetti and au­di­ence in­ter­ac­tion lacks drama, but it also helps in­su­late the mes­sage and di­lute in­tra-party dif­fer­ences on health­care, cli­mate change and po­lice re­form so they do not come to the fore.</p>
    <p>Pre­sum­ing Mr Bi­den nails his speech by pre­sent­ing a clear and com­pelling vi­sion for how he will gov­ern, he will be three-for-three when it comes to the cam­paign’s key mile­stones so far: pri­mary, vice-pres­i­dent se­lec­tion and con­ven­tion.</p>
    <p>USU­ALLY, A CON­VEN­TION WOULD BE CRIT­I­CAL FOR DEMOCRATS</p>
    <p>The qua­dren­nial na­tional po­lit­i­cal party con­ven­tions are espe­cially im­por­tant for the party run­ning against an in­cum­bent pres­i­dent.</p>
    <p>The con­ven­tion gives the party a ve­hi­cle to come to­gether and or­gan­ise the elec­tion cam­paign by al­lo­cat­ing peo­ple and re­sources.</p>
    <p>A na­tional cam­paign has al­ways re­quired ex­ten­sive re­sources for its ground ef­forts, such as ex­ten­sive door knock­ing and in-per­son voter reg­is­tra­tion drives, large-scale po­lit­i­cal events head­lined by the nom­i­nees or their top-level sur­ro­gates and a mas­sive “get out the vote” ef­fort on elec­tion day.</p>
    <p>In this elec­tion, the Trump cam­paign had a his­toric jump on its Bi­den coun­ter­part.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump an­nounced his re-elec­tion cam­paign within weeks of his 2016 elec­tion and of­fi­cially filed his cam­paign with the Fed­eral Elec­tion Com­mis­sion on the day of his in­au­gu­ra­tion.</p>
    <p>The pre­vi­ous five pres­i­dents – Barack Obama, Ge­orge W. Bush, Bill Clin­ton, Ge­orge H.W. Bush and Ron­ald Rea­gan – each de­clared their can­di­da­cies for re-elec­tion only in the third year of their pres­i­den­cies. Mr Trump has been cam­paign­ing since the mo­ment he was sworn in.</p>
    <p>Head­ing into the sum­mer, Pres­i­dent Trump’s re-elec­tion cam­paign had 1,500 staff in his tar­get states, dou­ble the num­ber his chal­lenger had, and had used his ral­lies and other po­lit­i­cal events from 2017 on­wards to train about 1.5 mil­lion vol­un­teers and con­tact more than 55 mil­lion vot­ers.</p>
    <p>But Covid-19 has forced much of the cam­paign into vir­tual mode, blunt­ing much of Mr Trump’s edge in cam­paign re­sources and abil­ity to rally his sup­port­ers.</p>
    <p>Just as the Democrats had to scrap plans for a live con­ven­tion in Milwaukee, Wis­con­sin, this year, the Trump cam­paign had to shift plans for one in Char­lotte, North Carolina, to one in Jack­sonville, Florida, be­fore scrap­ping that as well.</p>
    <p>Now both par­ties are on a more equal foot­ing, live-stream­ing con­ven­tion events from var­i­ous parts of the coun­try.</p>
    <p>Get­ting peo­ple to vote will be a crit­i­cal test for each of the two cam­paigns, but the type of or­gan­i­sa­tion needed to do so won’t be the same this year.</p>
    <p>DEMOCRAT DIS­SI­DENTS ON MUTE</p>
    <p>The lat­est polls on Sun­day show Mr Bi­den ahead na­tion­ally and in the bat­tle­ground states. Mr Trump has also united nearly all of the Demo­cratic Party’s fac­tions with the com­mon aim of de­feat­ing him on Nov 3.</p>
    <p>Still, the Democrats are not aligned on key is­sues. On health­care, the party is torn be­tween those who de­mand a new, sin­gle-payer sys­tem and oth­ers who want re­form within the ex­ist­ing sys­tem.</p>
    <p>While the party moves in the same di­rec­tion on po­lice re­form and cli­mate change, pro­gres­sive mem­bers such as AOC want to go fur­ther than the more mod­er­ate wing.</p>
    <p>For ex­am­ple, Rep­re­sen­ta­tive Rashida Tlaib, a fel­low mem­ber of</p>
    <p>“The Squad” of left-lean­ing con­gress­women, voted against the party plat­form and opted for Mr San­ders to be the pres­i­den­tial nom­i­nee in a round of on­line vot­ing by del­e­gates ear­lier this month.</p>
    <p>In the past, in­tra-party ten­sions would of­ten break out into the open at the con­ven­tion, in the full glare of a na­tional au­di­ence. But with­out the in-per­son con­ven­tion this year, very few head­lines will be gen­er­ated that do not fit the script. There can be no floor demon­stra­tions to make a point.</p>
    <p>As a columnist in The Na­tion weekly mag­a­zine put it, “no­body can hear pro­gres­sives boo while locked on the other side of a Zoom pre­sen­ta­tion”.</p>
    <p>Un­like in 2016, both par­ties will come out of their con­ven­tions united. But that’s a much tougher feat to pull off for the Democrats, and much more valuable to them.</p>
    <p>BUILD­ING MO­MEN­TUM</p>
    <p>In pre-Covid-19 times, party con­ven­tions also served a key tac­ti­cal pur­pose – win­ning or hold­ing on to an elec­torally sig­nif­i­cant state.</p>
    <p>By spend­ing a full week in a swing state and bring­ing US$200 mil­lion (S$274 mil­lion) in eco­nomic ben­e­fit as a re­sult of up to 50,000 peo­ple flocking to the mega event, a party hopes to build mo­men­tum there go­ing into the gen­eral elec­tion.</p>
    <p>Wis­con­sin, cho­sen by the Democrats, was won by Mr Trump in 2016 by just over 22,000 votes out of more than 2.7 mil­lion cast. The Democrats had hoped that by hold­ing their con­ven­tion there, they could swing Wis­con­sin’s elec­toral col­lege votes their way.</p>
    <p>Sim­i­larly, the Repub­li­cans were hop­ing to so­lid­ify their grip on North Carolina, which they won in the last elec­tion.</p>
    <p>In the lat­est RealClearP­ol­i­tics polling av­er­ages, Mr Bi­den is up 6.5 per cent in Wis­con­sin and Mr Trump is up 0.7 per cent in North Carolina.</p>
    <p>With both live con­ven­tions can­celled, Mr Trump is at a greater dis­ad­van­tage than Mr Bi­den in terms of hav­ing lost a valuable plat­form to give a much-needed boost to sup­port lev­els in a key state.</p>
    <p>True to form in ig­nor­ing all past po­lit­i­cal pro­to­cols, Mr Trump will try to up­stage the Democrats by turn­ing up in Wis­con­sin for a cam­paign stop dur­ing the Democrats’ con­ven­tion week.</p>
    <p>But short of Mr Trump dump­ing Vice-Pres­i­dent Mike Pence for former am­bas­sador to the United Na­tions Nikki Ha­ley as his run­ning mate, it will be hard to see how he can up­stage Mr Bi­den’s show this week, no mat­ter how hard he tries. Still, it’s not over for Mr Trump. To be re-elected, he needs to get his na­tional ap­proval rat­ing up to at least 46 per cent, his share of the pop­u­lar vote in 2016. The lat­est Gallup poll has him mired at 41 per cent.</p>
    <p>While five points is a lot to gain in just a few months, it’s hap­pened. Then in­cum­bent pres­i­dents Richard Nixon in 1972 and Bill Clin­ton in 1996 saw their ap­proval rat­ings im­prove by an even higher rate in the run-up to elec­tion day.</p>
    <p>For Mr Bi­den, the key re­main­ing op­por­tu­ni­ties and chal­lenges cen­tre on his per­for­mances in the de­bates sched­uled to take place be­tween Sept 29 and Oct 22.</p>
    <p>The most likely way for Mr</p>
    <p>Trump to gain the nec­es­sary spike in ap­proval will be to be viewed as han­dling the pan­demic bet­ter, such as through a ma­jor and gen­uine break­through.</p>
    <p>While “Op­er­a­tion Warp Speed” will not pro­duce a vac­cine dis­trib­uted to all Amer­i­cans by elec­tion day, good news of hav­ing one ready for pro­duc­tion be­fore then could give Mr Trump just enough of a boost to win.</p>
    <p>And there is yet an­other path to vic­tory for Mr Trump – for an elec­tion to oc­cur, peo­ple need to be able to vote. With all the tur­moil fac­ing the US Postal Ser­vice, thanks en­tirely to Mr Trump’s un­sub­stan­ti­ated and in­con­sis­tent di­a­tribes on the sub­ject and the ac­tions of his po­lit­i­cally in­stalled crony as post­mas­ter-gen­eral, fewer peo­ple may be able to do so. Mr Bi­den’s per­fect cam­paign to date may not be able to over­come that. ad­min­is­tra­tion as deputy gen­eral coun­sel at the Depart­ment of Trans­porta­tion and White House Cab­i­net sec­re­tary re­spec­tively. Mr Okun is se­nior adviser for global strate­gic con­sul­tancy McLarty As­so­ciates and is also a gover­nor of the Amer­i­can Chamber of Com­merce in Sin­ga­pore. Mr Mar­shall prac­tises law in Washington. The views are their own.</p>
