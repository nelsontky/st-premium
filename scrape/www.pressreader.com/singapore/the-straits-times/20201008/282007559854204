    <p>As Sin­ga­pore’s econ­omy ma­tures, the chal­lenge of cre­at­ing high-value-adding jobs for the grow­ing pro­fes­sional, man­age­rial, ex­ec­u­tive and tech­ni­cian (PMET) work­force has re­ceived in­creas­ing pol­icy at­ten­tion.</p>
    <p>Be­tween 2008 and 2018, the sup­ply of PMETs has in­creased with the share of Sin­ga­pore’s labour force, with ter­tiary education qual­i­fi­ca­tion ris­ing from 42.6 per cent to 56.2 per cent.</p>
    <p>The dra­matic ad­verse im­pact of Covid-19 on the econ­omy in gen­eral, and on spe­cific PMET-in­ten­sive sec­tors such as trans­port and hos­pi­tal­ity ser­vices in par­tic­u­lar, has fur­ther height­ened aware­ness of the ur­gency of the chal­lenge in re­cent months.</p>
    <p>To help ex­ist­ing busi­nesses sus­tain their cur­rent PMET jobs and to pro­vide new ones, es­pe­cially for older PMETs who may be most at risk, a wide range of pol­icy in­ter­ven­tions has been in­tro­duced by the Gov­ern­ment, and ad­di­tional ones are be­ing de­bated in Par­lia­ment.</p>
    <p>But there is an area that de­serves greater pol­icy at­ten­tion: how to en­cour­age older PMETs to be­come start-up en­trepreneur­s – mak­ing them the source, rather than the re­cip­i­ents, of job cre­ation.</p>
    <p>The pop­u­lar be­lief is that start-ups, es­pe­cially tech­nol­ogy-based ones, are founded mainly by young en­trepreneur­s, with images of Bill Gates and Mark Zucker­berg com­ing read­ily to mind.</p>
    <p>This is more a myth than re­al­ity: A size­able num­ber of new business start-ups are ac­tu­ally founded by older PMETs (those 40 years and above) and that on av­er­age, they are more likely to do bet­ter in job cre­ation than young en­trepreneur­s.</p>
    <p>In a re­cent study cov­er­ing</p>
    <p>2.7 mil­lion business start-ups be­tween 2007 and 2014 in the United States, Pro­fes­sor Pierre Azoulay at the Mas­sachusetts In­sti­tute of Tech­nol­ogy and Dr Javier Mi­randa at the United States Cen­sus Bureau found the av­er­age age of peo­ple who founded any business that hired at least one em­ployee to be 42.</p>
    <p>Among en­trepreneur­s who founded start-ups that are likely to be tech-based or in­no­va­tion-in­ten­sive – as mea­sured by one of sev­eral in­di­ca­tors such as own­ing a patent, re­ceiv­ing ven­ture cap­i­tal in­vest­ment, or op­er­at­ing in an in­dus­try that em­ploys a high</p>
    <p>frac­tion of Stem (sci­ence, tech­nol­ogy, en­gi­neer­ing and math­e­mat­ics)-ed­u­cated per­sons – the av­er­age age of found­ing turns out to be sim­i­lar.</p>
    <p>In­ter­est­ingly, look­ing at only the 0.1 per cent of start-ups that had grown the fastest in terms of em­ploy­ment in the first five years, the av­er­age age of founders is even higher, at 45.</p>
    <p>The study also shows that hav­ing the rel­e­vant ex­pe­ri­ence mat­ters: Those en­trepreneur­s who had started their busi­nesses in the same in­dus­try they had worked in be­fore grew, on av­er­age, more than twice as fast as those with­out prior back­ground in their cho­sen in­dus­try.</p>
    <p>MEAN AGE FOR START-UPS</p>
    <p>Our own re­search on start-ups in Sin­ga­pore tells a sim­i­lar story. Draw­ing on data from the an­nual Global En­trepreneur­ship Mon­i­tor (GEM) sur­veys for the most re­cent three years (2012 to 2014) where we have data on Sin­ga­pore, the mean age of Sin­ga­porean adults who were en­gaged in start-up ac­tiv­i­ties at the time of the sur­vey was over 39, just a lit­tle bit lower than in the US study.</p>
    <p>The GEM sur­veys cov­ered new business for­ma­tion in gen­eral. To look at the sub­set of tech start-ups, in­clud­ing mo­bile/In­ter­net/ e-com­merce-re­lated start-ups, we con­ducted a sur­vey in 2016 cov­er­ing 530 such start-ups.</p>
    <p>The mean age of en­trepreneur­s at the time they founded their</p>
    <p>start-ups was es­ti­mated to be 35.3, some­what younger than en­trepreneur­s in gen­eral.</p>
    <p>How­ever, if we look at only the sub­set of tech­nol­ogy-in­ten­sive start-ups that ei­ther owned one or more patents, or were in “deep-tech” sec­tors, the mean age goes up to over 39.</p>
    <p>We also repli­cated the re­gres­sion analysis by the US study us­ing our Sin­ga­pore sam­ple and found that the age of founders at the time of found­ing is sig­nif­i­cantly cor­re­lated with the start-ups’ three-year em­ploy­ment growth per­for­mance, as in the US study.</p>
    <p>More­over, hav­ing prior work ex­pe­ri­ence in the pri­vate sec­tor has a pos­i­tive im­pact on the em­ploy­ment growth per­for­mance of the firm.</p>
    <p>It is im­por­tant to note that the sig­nif­i­cant par­tic­i­pa­tion of older PMETs (40 years or above) in new business start-ups has oc­curred in the last 10 years, even though most gov­ern­ment pol­icy at­ten­tion in the same pe­riod has fo­cused more on pro­mot­ing, and sup­port­ing, young en­trepreneur­s.</p>
    <p>In par­tic­u­lar, ter­tiary stu­dents and re­cent grad­u­ates in Sin­ga­pore have ben­e­fited enor­mously from gov­ern­ment sup­port for var­i­ous en­trepreneur­ship education pro­grammes and in­cu­ba­tion ser­vices for start-ups.</p>
    <p>Al­though not in­tended as such, gov­ern­ment ven­ture in­vest­ment co-fund­ing pro­grammes such as the Tech­nol­ogy In­cu­ba­tion Scheme had been used mainly by the re­cip­i­ent ven­ture cap­i­tal funds to in­vest in In­ter­net/mo­bile-re­lated start-ups. These start-ups were pri­mar­ily started by young en­trepreneur­s.</p>
    <p>It is true that gov­ern­ment agen­cies such as the Na­tional Re­search Foun­da­tion (NRF), Agency for Sci­ence, Tech­nol­ogy and Re­search and uni­ver­si­ties them­selves have sought to en­cour­age deep-tech spin-offs to com­mer­cialise re­search com­ing out of pub­licly funded re­search, and such spin-offs could ar­guably in­volve the en­gage­ment of pro­fes­sors and re­search sci­en­tists who are older.</p>
    <p>RE­SEARCH MATCHED WITH EX­PE­RI­ENCE</p>
    <p>How­ever, ex­pe­ri­ence world­wide has shown that few aca­demic re­searchers make good en­trepreneur­s, and that a more likely route to suc­cess­ful univer­sity/pub­lic re­search</p>
    <p>in­sti­tute spin-offs is to get ex­pe­ri­enced/sea­soned PMETs from in­dus­try to take up the start-up ex­e­cu­tion role.</p>
    <p>How­ever, this “match­ing” of in­dus­try ex­per­tise with re­search sci­en­tists does not oc­cur eas­ily and needs to be ac­tively pro­moted through pol­icy in­ter­ven­tion.</p>
    <p>Our own ex­pe­ri­ence in pro­mot­ing this, through the Lean Launch­pad Pro­gramme (LLP) that we ini­ti­ated with fund­ing sup­port of the Min­istry of Education and sub­se­quently NRF, has shown promis­ing re­sults.</p>
    <p>One ex­am­ple is Kos­mode Health, a com­pany co-founded in Novem­ber 2016 by As­so­ciate Pro­fes­sor Huang De­jian, a chemist and food scientist from the Na­tional Univer­sity of Sin­ga­pore, and Ms Florence Leong, a for­mer phar­ma­ceu­ti­cal ex­ec­u­tive.</p>
    <p>The pair were con­nected in 2015 through LLP, and the men­tor-mentee re­la­tion­ship grew into an en­tre­pre­neur­ial part­ner­ship, with both in­vest­ing in a Sin­ga­pore com­pany that up­cy­cles food pro­cess­ing by-prod­ucts for hu­man nu­tri­tion and bio­med­i­cal ap­pli­ca­tions.</p>
    <p>Their com­ple­men­tary skill sets – Prof Huang’s core plant ex­trac­tion ex­per­tise and Ms Leong’s oper­a­tions and business strat­egy ex­pe­ri­ence – cul­mi­nated in Kos­mode Health de­vel­op­ing, among other things, starch­less noo­dles with pro­tein and fi­bre for in­di­vid­u­als with high blood sugar and weight is­sues.</p>
    <p>POL­ICY IN­TER­VEN­TION</p>
    <p>A key advantage for older PMETs in start­ing new busi­nesses is their deep in­dus­try do­main knowl­edge and net­work con­nec­tions.</p>
    <p>How­ever, many of them of­ten face a chal­lenge in rais­ing ven­ture cap­i­tal fund­ing if they op­er­ate in highly spe­cialised industries such as oil bunker­ing ser­vices that few ven­ture cap­i­tal­ists have the do­main ex­per­tise to un­der­stand, or if the mar­ket niche they are tar­get­ing is too small to fit the ven­ture cap­i­tal fund­ing model.</p>
    <p>Pol­icy in­ter­ven­tion is thus nec­es­sary to ad­dress such fund­ing gaps.</p>
    <p>The re­cent ef­fort by the Mar­itime and Port Author­ity of Sin­ga­pore and En­ter­prise Sin­ga­pore, in which ven­ture in­vestors will in­ject a com­bined $50 mil­lion in mar­itime tech­nol­ogy start-ups, is a step in the right di­rec­tion, but more can be done.</p>
    <p>The en­gage­ment of older PMETs in start-ups en­com­passes more than tak­ing on the lead en­tre­pre­neur­ial role. Few solo-founded start-ups suc­ceed; most are team ef­forts.</p>
    <p>Many older PMETs can act as early an­gel in­vestors or ad­vis­ers, or take up in­terim senior man­age­ment roles in start-ups led by younger en­trepreneur­s who have the drive and tech-savvi­ness but lack business ex­pe­ri­ence, in­dus­try-spe­cific do­main knowl­edge or con­nec­tions.</p>
    <p>Such in­ter-gen­er­a­tional match­ing, how­ever, does not hap­pen eas­ily as it re­quires the right chem­istry and mu­tual trust, which are of­ten de­vel­oped only af­ter a process of mu­tual learning, adap­ta­tion of work cul­ture and role ex­pec­ta­tions on both sides.</p>
    <p>While a lot of the Gov­ern­ment’s cur­rent skills de­vel­op­ment pol­icy fo­cus has been on tech­ni­cal skills re­train­ing of older PMETs, more at­ten­tion needs to be paid to PMET train­ing to foster mind­set change, such as risk tol­er­ance, and to de­velop in­ter­per­sonal skills, such as coach­ing skills.</p>
    <p>From a longer-term per­spec­tive, Sin­ga­pore’s rapidly age­ing so­ci­ety will re­sult in sig­nif­i­cant growth in the pool of older PMETs, in­clud­ing many reach­ing the tra­di­tional re­tire­ment age, but who still have much to con­trib­ute pro­duc­tively.</p>
    <p>This is pro­vided the right en­gage­ment op­por­tu­ni­ties can be de­signed, such as stock op­tion vest­ing, and ef­fec­tively matched to their time pref­er­ence, for ex­am­ple, tak­ing on a part-time role.</p>
    <p>More pol­icy re­search and pol­icy ex­per­i­men­ta­tion should be en­cour­aged to pro­mote pro­duc­tive longevity through sup­port­ing the en­gage­ment of older PMETs in start-up en­trepreneur­ship.</p>
    <p>A size­able num­ber of new business start-ups are ac­tu­ally founded by older PMETs (those 40 years and above) and that on av­er­age, they are more likely to do bet­ter in job cre­ation than young en­trepreneur­s.</p>
