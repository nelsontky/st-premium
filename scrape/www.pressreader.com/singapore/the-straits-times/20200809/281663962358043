    <p>Every other day, home-grown cock­tail bar Jig­ger & Pony’s phone rings as con­cerned cus­tomers call to ask when the bar will re­open.</p>
    <p>The staff mem­ber on the other end of the line has no an­swer to that ques­tion.</p>
    <p>While the ma­jor­ity of bars in Sin­ga­pore have re­opened their doors, there re­main a hand­ful that are still barred from open­ing, in­clud­ing Jig­ger & Pony at ho­tel Amara Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>This is be­cause it holds only a bar li­cence, while those that have re­opened have food shop li­cences that al­low them to op­er­ate as food and bev­er­age es­tab­lish­ments, al­beit with re­stric­tions on group sizes and a 10.30pm curb on al­co­hol sales.</p>
    <p>The in­abil­ity to re­sume op­er­a­tion is es­pe­cially frus­trat­ing for the own­ers of Jig­ger & Pony, which clinched the top spot on the Asia’s 50 Best Bars list for the first time in May.</p>
    <p>Its co-founder Gan Guoyi, 36, said: “To be re­ally hon­est, the con­tin­ued clo­sure does af­fect our team morale, es­pe­cially see­ing other peo­ple re­sume oper­a­tions. Peo­ple in the hos­pi­tal­ity in­dus­try are very pas­sion­ate and we want to go back to our home base and press for­ward with our achieve­ments.”</p>
    <p>The bar was one of the “first few to close”, and it has been around 41/ months since it rolled down the 2 shut­ters.</p>
    <p>Bars, along with cin­e­mas and other en­ter­tain­ment out­lets, were the first to shut on March 27, when Sin­ga­pore was bat­tling a wave of im­ported Covid-19 cases.</p>
    <p>Be­fore the lock­down, the bar was the big­gest earner in the Jig­ger & Pony Group, bring­ing in al­most one-third of to­tal rev­enue. Now, it is be­ing sub­sidised by its other brands that have re­opened for busi­ness, such as cock­tail bar Gib­son and seafood restau­rant Hump­back.</p>
    <p>Jig­ger & Pony started of­fer­ing its cock­tails in bot­tled and pouch forms for home de­liv­ery a week be­fore the cir­cuit breaker kicked in on April 7.</p>
    <p>But de­mand has since ta­pered off in phase two of Sin­ga­pore’s re­open­ing. At its peak, de­liv­er­ies gen­er­ated around 30 per cent of the bar’s pre-Covid-19 rev­enue, but that has now dipped to less than 10 per cent.</p>
    <p>An­other bar that is un­able to open is Nutmeg & Clove, a cock­tail bar in Ann Siang Hill that came in at No. 32 on the Asia’s 50 Best Bars list.</p>
    <p>Its co-founder Colin Chia, 41, said busi­ness had al­ready been af­fected by can­cel­la­tions be­fore the Gov­ern­ment an­nounced that all bars had to close on March 27.</p>
    <p>“Truth is, I freaked out for an hour when I saw the news be­cause times were al­ready bad then,” he said.</p>
    <p>The next day, Mr Chia went straight into ac­tion to find cre­ative ways to keep the brand afloat as it rode out this pe­riod.</p>
    <p>Thank­fully, he said, Nutmeg & Clove has been sell­ing its bot­tled cock­tails since the start of its busi­ness in 2014, which made its tran­si­tion to de­liv­ery-only much smoother. It also hosts cor­po­rate vir­tual cock­tail mas­ter­classes.</p>
    <p>Since last month, it has found a “tem­po­rary home” at Roketto Iza­kaya at Frasers Tower, where its pop-up bar of­fers cock­tails paired to the diner’s mod-Sin cui­sine. The col­lab­o­ra­tion is on till the end of this month.</p>
    <p>“Do­ing all this is not just to make money, but it’s about con­tin­u­ing to keep the brand in the minds of con­sumers. I spent so many years build­ing the brand, it would be a shame if peo­ple for­get about us,” he said.</p>
    <p>He ac­knowl­edged his bar is one of the “for­tu­nate ones”, as the popup col­lab­o­ra­tion and bot­tled cock­tail de­liv­er­ies gen­er­ate around 60 per cent of its pre-Covid-19 rev­enue.</p>
    <p>Bar own­ers are keep­ing their hopes up for the light at the end of the tun­nel. As Jig­ger & Pony’s Ms Gan puts it: “It’s de­mor­al­is­ing but we’re do­ing our best to re­fine our busi­ness, so when the Gov­ern­ment says we can open, we are ready.”</p>
    <p>KEEP­ING THE BRAND ALIVE</p>
    <p>Do­ing all this is not just to make money, but it’s about con­tin­u­ing to keep the brand in the minds of con­sumers. I spent so many years build­ing the brand, it would be a shame ’’ if peo­ple for­get about us. ’’</p>
