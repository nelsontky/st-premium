    <p>Gov­ern­ment grants aimed at off­set­ting the fall­out from the Covid-19 pan­demic were not enough to pre­vent Com­fortDelGro from in­cur­ring its first-ever loss.</p>
    <p>The trans­port giant re­ported a net loss of $6 mil­lion for the six months ended June 30, com­pared with a net profit of $146.3 mil­lion for the same pe­riod last year.</p>
    <p>Com­fortDelGro said yes­ter­day that it would have spilt a lot more red ink if not for Covid-19 re­lief from the Gov­ern­ment.</p>
    <p>It posted a loss of $75.7 mil­lion at the op­er­at­ing level be­fore gov­ern­ment re­lief. Aid amount­ing to $82.3 mil­lion al­lowed it to post an op­er­at­ing profit of $6.6 mil­lion.</p>
    <p>Rev­enue fell by 20.8 per cent to $1.53 bil­lion, while op­er­at­ing costs de­clined 10.8 per cent to $1.52 bil­lion.</p>
    <p>It in­curred a loss per share of 0.28 cent, from earn­ings per share of 6.76 cents pre­vi­ously. Net tan­gi­ble as­sets per share stood at 114.33 cents, from 119.8 cents as at Dec 31 last year.</p>
    <p>Mar­gins be­fore in­ter­est, tax, de­pre­ci­a­tion and amor­ti­sa­tion shrank from 22.5 per cent to 16.2 per cent.</p>
    <p>In Sin­ga­pore, lower pub­lic trans­port rid­er­ship and rental waivers for taxi driv­ers took a toll on its bot­tom line. The group said its op­er­a­tions in Aus­tralia, Britain, China, Ire­land, Viet­nam and Malaysia had also been “hard hit by the on­go­ing pan­demic”.</p>
    <p>The great­est im­pact has been from lower pub­lic trans­port rid­er­ship and taxi de­mand, it noted.</p>
    <p>Rev­enue from over­seas for the first half was $677 mil­lion, or 44.3 per cent of group turnover, ver­sus $805.1 mil­lion, or 41.8 per cent for the pre­vi­ous cor­re­spond­ing pe­riod.</p>
    <p>Seg­men­tally, Com­fortDelGro’s pub­lic trans­port rev­enue was 12.9 per cent lower at $1.23 bil­lion.</p>
    <p>More un­hired cabs drove taxi turnover down 47.2 per cent to $178.6 mil­lion.</p>
    <p>Rev­enue from its au­to­mo­tive en­gi­neer­ing di­vi­sion was 36 per cent lower at $82.1 mil­lion, due partly to the sus­pen­sion of busi­ness dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker pe­riod.</p>
    <p>The same ap­plied to its ve­hi­cle in­spec­tion, driv­ing school and bus sta­tion di­vi­sions. The only ex­cep­tion was its ve­hi­cle rental busi­ness, which posted a 4.5 per cent rise in turnover to $13.9 mil­lion.</p>
    <p>De­spite the weaker per­for­mance, the group’s fi­nan­cial po­si­tion re­mained strong. Be­cause of the un­prece­dented busi­ness en­vi­ron­ment, it made a rare in­terim pro­vi­sion for im­pair­ment on ve­hi­cles and good­will of $30.8 mil­lion.</p>
    <p>The group had cash and equiv­a­lents of $619.9 mil­lion, ver­sus $553.2 mil­lion pre­vi­ously.</p>
    <p>After ac­count­ing for bor­row­ings of $546.1 mil­lion and lease li­a­bil­i­ties from fi­nan­cial in­sti­tu­tions of $95.7 mil­lion, it had a net debt po­si­tion of $21.9 mil­lion, rep­re­sent­ing a net gear­ing ra­tio of 0.8 per cent, com­pared with 1.3 per cent as at Dec 31 last year. Its gross gear­ing ra­tio stood at 22.3 per cent com­pared with 21.1 per cent as at Dec 31.</p>
    <p>The group said the fu­ture looks un­cer­tain. “Gov­ern­ments have pro­vided sig­nif­i­cant tem­po­rary re­lief for the near term, but the sus­tain­abil­ity of such re­liefs is un­cer­tain,” it said, not­ing that a num­ber of cities have had to lock down again be­cause in­fec­tion cases resur­faced.</p>
    <p>Rev­enues are ex­pected to re­main de­pressed and mar­gins un­der pres­sure, it added.</p>
    <p>Notwith­stand­ing, Com­fortDelGro’s strong bal­ance sheet al­lows it to “trans­form and build its ca­pa­bil­i­ties while look­ing for growth op­por­tu­ni­ties in over­seas markets”.</p>
    <p>Its di­rec­tors are not rec­om­mend­ing an in­terim div­i­dend in the light of the sit­u­a­tion. Last year, the com­pany paid out 4.5 cents a share.</p>
    <p>Chief ex­ec­u­tive Yang Ban Seng said that de­spite the pro­longed cri­sis, it was able to con­tinue run­ning its busi­nesses “with­out let­ting any of our staff go”. The group has around 20,000 em­ploy­ees here and abroad.</p>
    <p>In Sin­ga­pore, lower pub­lic trans­port rid­er­ship and rental waivers for taxi driv­ers took a toll on its bot­tom line. The group said its op­er­a­tions in Aus­tralia, Britain, China, Ire­land, Viet­nam and Malaysia had also been “hard hit by the on­go­ing pan­demic”.</p>
