    <p>NUM­BER OF CHI­NESE APPS PRES­I­DENT DON­ALD TRUMP HAS BARRED U.S. TRANS­AC­TIONS WITH |</p>
    <p>US Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump has signed an ex­ec­u­tive or­der ban­ning trans­ac­tions with eight Chi­nese soft­ware ap­pli­ca­tions, in­clud­ing Ant Group’s Ali­pay mo­bile pay­ment app, the White House said, es­ca­lat­ing ten­sions with Bei­jing two weeks be­fore Pres­i­dent-elect Joe Bi­den takes of­fice.</p>
    <p>Tues­day’s move, first re­ported by Reuters, is aimed at curb­ing the threat to Amer­i­cans posed by Chi­nese soft­ware ap­pli­ca­tions, which have large user bases and ac­cess to sen­si­tive data, said a se­nior ad­min­is­tra­tion of­fi­cial.</p>
    <p>The or­der ar­gues that the United States must take “ag­gres­sive ac­tion” against de­vel­op­ers of Chi­nese soft­ware ap­pli­ca­tions to pro­tect na­tional se­cu­rity.</p>
    <p>It tasks the Com­merce Depart­ment with defin­ing which trans­ac­tions will be banned un­der the di­rec­tive within 45 days and tar­gets Ten­cent Hold­ings’ QQ Wal­let and WeChat Pay as well.</p>
    <p>The or­der also names CamS­can­ner, SHAREit, Ten­cent QQ, VMate, which is pub­lished by Alibaba Group sub­sidiary UCWeb, and Bei­jing King­soft Of­fice Soft­ware’s WPS Of­fice.</p>
    <p>“By ac­cess­ing per­sonal elec­tronic de­vices such as smart­phones, tablets and com­put­ers, Chi­nese con­nected soft­ware ap­pli­ca­tions can ac­cess and cap­ture vast swaths of in­for­ma­tion from users, in­clud­ing sen­si­tive per­son­ally iden­ti­fi­able in­for­ma­tion and pri­vate in­for­ma­tion,” the ex­ec­u­tive or­der states.</p>
    <p>Such data col­lec­tion “would per­mit China to track the lo­ca­tions of fed­eral em­ploy­ees and con­trac­tors, and build dossiers of per­sonal in­for­ma­tion”, the doc­u­ment adds.</p>
    <p>China yes­ter­day said it will take nec­es­sary mea­sures to safe­guard the le­git­i­mate rights of com­pa­nies in view of the Trump or­der. For­eign Min­istry spokesman Hua Chun­y­ing told a reg­u­lar brief­ing that the US was abus­ing its na­tional power and un­rea­son­ably sup­press­ing for­eign com­pa­nies.</p>
    <p>King­soft said in a state­ment pub­lished by Chi­nese state me­dia that it did not ex­pect Mr Trump’s or­der to sub­stan­tially af­fect the com­pany’s busi­ness in the short term. Ant, the Bi­den tran­si­tion team and SHAREit de­clined to com­ment.</p>
    <p>Alibaba, Ten­cent, CamS­can­ner and the Chi­nese Em­bassy in Wash­ing­ton did not re­spond to re­quests for com­ment.</p>
    <p>The or­der aims to ce­ment Mr Trump’s tough-on-China legacy be­fore the Jan 20 in­au­gu­ra­tion of Mr Bi­den, a Demo­crat, who has said lit­tle about how he plans to ad­dress spe­cific tech threats from China.</p>
    <p>Mr Bi­den could, how­ever, re­voke the or­der on the first day of his pres­i­dency.</p>
    <p>This lat­est or­der will likely ratchet up ten­sions fur­ther be­tween Wash­ing­ton and Bei­jing, which have been locked in a bit­ter dis­pute over the ori­gins of the coro­n­avirus and a Chi­nese crack­down on Hong Kong.</p>
    <p>The Com­merce Depart­ment plans to act be­fore Jan 20 to iden­tify pro­hib­ited trans­ac­tions, an­other US of­fi­cial told Reuters.</p>
    <p>The di­rec­tive mir­rors Mr Trump’s ex­ec­u­tive or­ders signed last Au­gust di­rect­ing Com­merce to block some US trans­ac­tions with WeChat and the Chi­nese-owned video app TikTok.</p>
    <p>Those re­stric­tions, how­ever, were blocked by courts mainly on free­dom of speech grounds.</p>
