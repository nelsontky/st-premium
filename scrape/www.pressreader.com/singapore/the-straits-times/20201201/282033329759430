    <p>A mo­tor­cy­clist, who said he col­lided with a large sam­bar deer that he al­leged was dash­ing across Up­per Thom­son Road, is tak­ing the Land Trans­port Author­ity (LTA) and the Na­tional Parks Board (NParks) to court for neg­li­gence.</p>
    <p>Mr Muham­mad Aliff Mohd Jef­eree, who had head, shoul­der and leg in­juries, is seek­ing dam­ages from both statu­tory boards for the ac­ci­dent at 9.45pm on Sept 21 last year.</p>
    <p>The law­suit by the 26-year-old, brought up for men­tion in the State Courts yes­ter­day, comes amid con­cern over wild an­i­mals en­croach­ing onto pub­lic ar­eas, fol­low­ing the re­ported case of a woman who was at­tacked by a wild boar in Pasir Ris last month. It could also clar­ify the is­sue of who may be legally li­able when a wild an­i­mal knocks into a road user.</p>
    <p>Both LTA and NParks have de­nied the claims in court pa­pers filed in Oc­to­ber and coun­tered that Mr Aliff has him­self to blame for the al­leged ac­ci­dent.</p>
    <p>Mr Aliff, in court pa­pers filed, pointed out that LTA is the statu­tory board in charge of main­tain­ing the land trans­port sys­tem and that NParks has a sim­i­lar man­date to man­age wildlife and an­i­mals here.</p>
    <p>There­fore, both should have been aware of the pres­ence of an­i­mals and the hazard they pose to road users like him­self, he said.</p>
    <p>His lawyer Hoh Chin Cha, from Hoh Law Corp, also ar­gued in court pa­pers filed that LTA has a duty to man­age and main­tain the road to pre­vent en­croach­ment by wild an­i­mals that could en­dan­ger mo­torists.</p>
    <p>He al­leged that LTA failed to take pre­ven­tive mea­sures and NParks failed to take all rea­son­able steps to en­sure an­i­mals in the na­ture re­serve, in par­tic­u­lar large an­i­mals, do not en­croach on the roads and pose a dan­ger to road users.</p>
    <p>Mr Aliff, a tech­ni­cian, is seek­ing com­pen­sa­tion for the cost of med­i­cal treat­ment, loss of earn­ings, and pain and suf­fer­ing, among other things.</p>
    <p>LTA, in de­fence pa­pers filed, said its du­ties in main­tain­ing the land trans­port sys­tem do not, and can­not rea­son­ably, ex­tend to know­ing and con­trol­ling the move­ments of wild an­i­mals or steer­ing such an­i­mals away from pub­lic roads.</p>
    <p>It ar­gued that its pri­mary re­spon­si­bil­ity is to de­velop and man­age Sin­ga­pore’s land trans­port in­fra­struc­ture and sys­tems, which it has per­formed rea­son­ably and with due care, bear­ing in mind its “fi­nite re­sources”.</p>
    <p>Its lawyers from Den­tons Rodyk in court pa­pers filed also pointed to the signs in­stalled by LTA along Up­per Thom­son Road that said: “An­i­mals Ahead”.</p>
    <p>There was one such sign just be­fore the site of the al­leged ac­ci­dent, LTA noted.</p>
    <p>The signs are to alert road users of the po­ten­tial pres­ence of an­i­mals in the area, it said, adding that Mr Aliff ought to have known of the pos­si­bil­ity of an­i­mals in the area.</p>
    <p>NParks pointed out that its du­ties do not in­clude the man­age­ment of an­i­mals and wildlife in Sin­ga­pore but in­clude man­ag­ing the an­i­mal pop­u­la­tion in Sin­ga­pore, among other things.</p>
    <p>Its lawyers from Ra­jah & Tann in court pa­pers filed said NParks had taken ad­e­quate mea­sures and rea­son­able care to pre­vent threats or risks to pub­lic safety and health.</p>
    <p>Also, NParks’ pe­ri­odic sur­veys of the sam­bar deer pop­u­la­tion in the Up­per Thom­son area found the num­bers were rea­son­able and man­age­able.</p>
    <p>It fur­ther said that there was no trace of the deer when its of­fi­cers went to the col­li­sion site af­ter the al­leged ac­ci­dent took place.</p>
    <p>Both LTA and NParks, when con­tacted, said they were un­able to com­ment as le­gal pro­ceed­ings are on­go­ing.</p>
