    <p>Malay lan­guage teacher Siti Ro­hani Se­la­mat, 35, has tried to in­cor­po­rate tech­nol­ogy and gam­ing el­e­ments into lessons to make learn­ing about Malay lan­guage and cul­ture more im­mer­sive for stu­dents.</p>
    <p>When schools moved to home­based learn­ing amid the pan­demic, she cre­ated quiz games on­line to help stu­dents con­sol­i­date what they learnt in an en­joy­able way.</p>
    <p>The Fuhua Sec­ondary School teacher said: “Stu­dents are driven into a dig­i­tal world, and not us­ing it elim­i­nates the younger gen­er­a­tion from po­ten­tial learn­ing op­por­tu­ni­ties.”</p>
    <p>Ms Ro­hani is one of three win­ners of this year’s Arif Budi­man Malay Lan­guage Teacher Award (Agab), which hon­ours teach­ers for their out­stand­ing con­tri­bu­tions in the teach­ing and learn­ing of the Malay lan­guage. Min­is­ter for So­cial and Fam­ily De­vel­op­ment and Min­is­ter-in-charge of Mus­lim Af­fairs Masa­gos Zulk­i­fli pre­sented the awards to the win­ners on Satur­day.</p>
    <p>Agab 2020 is jointly or­gan­ised by the Malay Lan­guage Coun­cil Sin­ga­pore, Malay Lan­guage Teach­ers As­so­ci­a­tion, Berita Har­ian and the</p>
    <p>Malay Lan­guage Learn­ing and Pro­mo­tion Com­mit­tee.</p>
    <p>The Role Model award for teach­ers with 10 years or more of ser­vice went to Ms Elna Hussin, 44, who has 17 years of teach­ing ex­pe­ri­ence and re­mains com­mit­ted to self-de­vel­op­ment by learn­ing new teach­ing con­cepts to en­gage her pupils.</p>
    <p>“Stu­dents tend to ‘shut off’ in class as not all of them un­der­stand or speak Malay very well,” she said.</p>
    <p>The West­wood Pri­mary School teacher or­gan­ised field trips to Kam­pong Lorong Buangkok to im­merse her pupils in Malay cul­ture.</p>
    <p>She also con­ducts oral lessons us­ing Flip­grid, an ap­pli­ca­tion that al­lows pupils to watch videos and ver­bally record their re­sponses at home, en­abling her to give per­son­alised feed­back to help them speak Malay more con­fi­dently.</p>
    <p>Ms Syahi­rah Sa’adon, 28, who won un­der the Mo­ti­va­tion cat­e­gory for teach­ers with un­der 10 years of ser­vice, is a Malay lan­guage teacher and Val­ues-In-Ac­tion co­or­di­na­tor at West View Pri­mary School.</p>
    <p>When schools re­opened af­ter clo­sures to curb Covid-19’s spread, she con­tin­ued lessons at a slower pace and en­cour­aged pupils to share their con­cerns, to en­sure they did not feel over­whelmed.</p>
    <p>She has also or­gan­ised events to en­cour­age char­i­ta­ble acts and civic-con­scious­ness among pupils. In 2019, she col­lab­o­rated with Food From The Heart and tasked pupils with do­nat­ing food and rais­ing aware­ness for the cause.</p>
    <p>She said teach­ers must be role mod­els to en­cour­age stu­dents to em­body good qual­i­ties and cul­ti­vate a deeper ap­pre­ci­a­tion for Malay lan­guage and cul­ture.</p>
