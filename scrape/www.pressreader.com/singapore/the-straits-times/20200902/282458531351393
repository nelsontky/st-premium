    <p>I have long been seen as an Ap­ple fan­boy, such that there are those who think I be­lieve Ap­ple can do no wrong.</p>
    <p>This is not true. I have crit­i­cised Ap­ple many times in the past – most re­cently about Face ID’s in­con­ve­nience in this age of mask-wear­ing.</p>
    <p>How­ever, the re­cent “war” be­tween United States game de­vel­oper Epic Games and Ap­ple makes me want to take the side of the Cu­per­tino tech gi­ant.</p>
    <p>Epic Games has made some of my favourite games, such as the In­fin­ity Blade and Gears Of War se­ries, and li­censes its game en­gine – Un­real En­gine – to other game de­vel­op­ers. It has also taken part in Ap­ple key­note events to show­case its lat­est games.</p>
    <p>In case you haven’t been fol­low­ing the news from late last month, Ap­ple has taken down Fort­nite – Epic Games’ cash-cow game – from the App Store for vi­o­lat­ing its terms of ser­vice.</p>
    <p>This is due to a new ver­sion of Fort­nite by­pass­ing the App Store’s pay­ment ser­vices, thereby al­low­ing Epic Games to avoid pay­ing 30 per cent of its rev­enue from the game to Ap­ple. Google has banned Fort­nite from the Google Play Store for the same rea­son.</p>
    <p>Avail­able on al­most all plat­forms from An­droid to Nin­tendo Switch, Fort­nite is a sur­vival shooter game that had more than 250 mil­lion play­ers as of March last year, with about US$1.8 bil­lion (S$2.5 bil­lion) in rev­enue last year, ac­cord­ing to Su­perData Re­search.</p>
    <p>Fol­low­ing its ban, Epic Games hit back with sep­a­rate law­suits against</p>
    <p>Ap­ple and Google, ac­cus­ing them of anti-trust be­hav­iour and ask­ing for Fort­nite to be put back in both app stores.</p>
    <p>How­ever, a US court found that Epic Games had breached its con­tract with Ap­ple and that the lat­ter has the right to con­tinue keep­ing Fort­nite off its App Store.</p>
    <p>De­spite the likes of Google and dig­i­tal gam­ing stores Steam and GOG also im­ple­ment­ing a 30 per cent rev­enue-cut scheme, it is Ap­ple that has been in the crosshairs of Epic Games’ pub­lic­ity stunt.</p>
    <p>Epic Games has been whip­ping up pub­lic sen­ti­ment against Ap­ple by por­tray­ing it­self as the rev­o­lu­tion­ary against an evil em­pire. It even re­leased a par­ody of Ap­ple’s fa­mous 1984 ad­ver­tise­ment about “free­ing” Fort­nite.</p>
    <p>Epic Games seems to be play­ing the vic­tim card. But, as the court judge who ruled in favour of Fort­nite’s ban from the App Store said, the de­vel­oper’s cur­rent predica­ment is pretty much self-in­flicted.</p>
    <p>To me, what Epic Games is do­ing is akin to setting up shop in a re­tail mall and de­cid­ing not to pay the monthly rent be­cause it sud­denly feels the amount is too high, de­spite its roar­ing busi­ness.</p>
    <p>So it starts cry­ing “evil land­lord” and tries to get oth­ers to lift their pitch­forks to fight its bat­tle.</p>
    <p>Ap­ple and Google have spent years stream­lin­ing the work flow for de­vel­op­ers and cu­rat­ing the con­tent of their app stores.</p>
    <p>So if you want to take ad­van­tage of their dis­tri­bu­tion chan­nels, you ought to pay your dues.</p>
    <p>Not to men­tion, if Ap­ple or</p>
    <p>Google give in to Epic Games’ de­mands, how are they go­ing to an­swer to other mo­bile and game de­vel­op­ers?</p>
    <p>And if ev­ery­one plays by his own rules in app stores, the en­su­ing chaos will ul­ti­mately hurt con­sumers.</p>
    <p>So, Epic Games, don’t make it sound like you are the bas­tion of light and jus­tice. You are just try­ing to make more money.</p>
    <p>It is okay to be greedy be­cause we are all try­ing to earn more money. But as a Chi­nese say­ing goes:</p>
    <p>“When you point a fin­ger at oth­ers, you are point­ing four fin­gers at your­self.”</p>
    <p>Ap­ple and Google have spent years stream­lin­ing the work flow for de­vel­op­ers and cu­rat­ing the con­tent of their app stores. So if you want to take ad­van­tage of their dis­tri­bu­tion chan­nels, you ought to pay your dues.</p>
