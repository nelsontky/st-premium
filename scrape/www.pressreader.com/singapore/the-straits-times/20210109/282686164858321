    <p>• Premier League teams should be vac­ci­nated against Covid-19 so the money saved from twice-weekly test­ing can be in­vested in the coun­try’s Na­tional Health Ser­vice (NHS) in­stead, Burn­ley man­ager Sean Dyche said on Thurs­day.</p>
    <p>Top-flight clubs’ play­ers and staff are be­ing tested twice a week, af­ter a highly in­fec­tious vari­ant of the virus led to a surge in in­fec­tions across the coun­try and forced the gov­ern­ment to an­nounce a new na­tional lock­down.</p>
    <p>“You look at the amount spent on test­ing i n the Premier League, then that money could be chan­nelled back into the NHS and into the vac­ci­na­tion sys­tem, surely that’s a bet­ter place to be than just con­tin­u­ally test­ing foot­ballers two-three times a week,” Dyche told re­porters.</p>
    <p>“Let me make it clear, there are peo­ple way in front of foot­ballers (as a pri­or­ity to be vac­ci­nated). I’m not re­motely sug­gest­ing that should be put in front of the wel­fare of peo­ple who are very vul­ner­a­ble.</p>
    <p>“What I’m say­ing is... it would be bet­ter putting the fund­ing that is put into test­ing into the sys­tem to en­cour­age more vac­ci­na­tions.”</p>
    <p>Dyche also said Burn­ley have a cou­ple of cases of the virus along with in­juries but they will be able to play to­day’s FA Cup game against third-tier side MK Dons.</p>
    <p>“I know the gen­eral rule of thumb is get­ting 14 play­ers out there to be ac­tive,” he added.</p>
    <p>“We would like to ful­fil that, and at this stage I think we will be ful­fill­ing that.”</p>
