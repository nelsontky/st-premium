    <p>Fash­ion mythol­ogy is filled with tales of young mod­els thrust into su­per­star­dom by chance – Kate Moss was dis­cov­ered while tran­sit­ing through JFK Air­port and Naomi Camp­bell and Gisele Bund­chen scouted while go­ing about their teenage lives.</p>
    <p>But as fash­ion it­self has trans­formed from a se­cre­tive, in­sider world into a pow­er­ful driver of the global econ­omy and a gi­ant pil­lar of pop­u­lar cul­ture, so have the jobs pop­u­lat­ing that world been de­mys­ti­fied; peo­ple no longer stum­ble into styling, cre­ative di­rect­ing or mod­el­ling.</p>
    <p>They grow up with clear goals of cat­a­pult­ing into the in­dus­try, set­ting them­selves on spe­cific paths to get there.</p>
    <p>It is this kind of am­bi­tion that has led these four Sin­ga­pore mod­els – Kaci Beh, Kai­gin Yong, Layla Ong and Duan Mei Yue – to the big, bright lights of the world’s fash­ion cap­i­tals.</p>
    <p>Duan, 20, has been in love with fash­ion since she was a child, though she ini­tially had another route in mind.</p>
    <p>“I ac­tu­ally thought of be­ing a de­signer. I love beau­ti­ful things, dress­ing up. I love how fash­ion can change the way you feel. When you wear some­thing amaz­ing, you feel it and you be­come it,” she says.</p>
    <p>Beh, too, thought about it for years be­fore tak­ing the plunge and “gath­ered my courage, worked hard to lose more than 10kg, then went to an open cast­ing call”, which has then led to an in­creas­ing num­ber of op­por­tu­ni­ties.</p>
    <p>Yong, 25, and Ong, 24, heeded the call of fash­ion only after try­ing their hand at sev­eral other en­deav­ours that proved un­ful­fill­ing.</p>
    <p>“I grad­u­ated from univer­sity in bi­ol­ogy and busi­ness, and then I did sales in a few dif­fer­ent in­dus­tries, but noth­ing made me really happy,” says Yong. “I wanted a dif­fer­ent life ex­pe­ri­ence and that led me to The New Pa­per New Face 2017 mod­el­ling com­pe­ti­tion.”</p>
    <p>Her win led to big­ger plat­forms, such as open­ing Sin­ga­pore Fash­ion Week 2017.</p>
    <p>Ong did short-lived stints i n var­i­ous of­fice jobs, the food and bev­er­age in­dus­try, the beauty and cos­met­ics sec­tor, and events plan­ning, be­fore a cast­ing call on In­sta­gram in 2016 made her take de­ci­sive ac­tion.</p>
    <p>She never really saw her­self as a model though she had been told that she had po­ten­tial to be one given her height.</p>
    <p>“In my mind, the mod­els I know are not the kind of model I am. I thought you had to look like a bomb­shell, with small lips, big eyes and big hair,” she says.</p>
    <p>It was op­por­tune then that Ong and this co­hort of stun­ning but un­con­ven­tion­ally pretty girls en­tered the in­dus­try just as it was be­ing driven by in­tense dis­cus­sions around di­ver­sity.</p>
    <p>Every­one was hun­gry for new faces to ex­pand the beauty ideal be­yond skinny, white and blonde.</p>
    <p>BREAK­ING THROUGH</p>
    <p>Iron­i­cally, Ong, who did not see her­self as model ma­te­rial, found her­self scor­ing the most cov­eted show at Mi­lan fash­ion week in 2018: an ex­clu­sive con­tract and with one of the hottest brands in fash­ion, no less.</p>
    <p>“I got a call from my agency in South Korea and they said Gucci wanted to see me. They flew me to Rome to meet the de­sign team and then to Mi­lan to see the cast­ing team,” re­calls Ong about that fate­ful sea­son in fall/win­ter 2018 when the Ital­ian house signed her as a run­way ex­clu­sive.</p>
    <p>She has since walked six Gucci shows, in lo­cales as far-flung as Paris, Ar­les and Rome; popped up in a Gucci Beauty cam­paign; and, since then, made cat­walk turns at Dolce & Gab­bana, Ro­darte and MSGM.</p>
    <p>An ex­clu­sive is not the only path­way to ma­jor fash­ion cred­i­bil­ity – land­ing a spot in a buzzed-about show in­stantly earns eye­balls world­wide and Yong scored at what was ar­guably the buzzi­est show of spring/sum­mer 2020: the Dries Van Noten spec­tac­u­lar de­signed in col­lab­o­ra­tion with Chris­tian Lacroix.</p>
    <p>Get­ting there was no walk in the park, though. As she re­calls: “It was my last cast­ing of the day, the 10th in fact. It was a rainy day so Paris was colder than usual. There were so many girls lined up that I didn’t have any ex­pec­ta­tions what­so­ever.”</p>
    <p>It all paid off, though, when she got to “walk i n front of Dries him­self, and Chris­tian; and then they started dis­cussing among them­selves, put this blazer on me, took some photos and, at the call­back, both de­sign­ers fit­ted the clothes on my body and I got to talk to them. They were so sweet and it was such an amaz­ing ex­pe­ri­ence”.</p>
    <p>It cer­tainly makes a model’s fash­ion jour­ney eas­ier to have bold­faced de­sign­ers in their cor­ner.</p>
    <p>For Beh, 21, it was Dolce & Gab­bana that was her spring­board onto the in­ter­na­tional stage.</p>
    <p>“When I did my first Dolce show in Fe­bru­ary, peo­ple were like, ‘oh my god’, and that was when I started get­ting more at­ten­tion from pro­duc­ers and cast­ing direc­tors,” she says.</p>
    <p>She fol­lowed up on that promis­ing Mi­lan de­but with an even more im­pres­sive show­ing dur­ing the spring/sum­mer 2020 sea­son, prov­ing her ver­sa­til­ity by go­ing from sen­su­ous Dolce & Ga­banna siren to Em­po­rio Ar­mani’s cool min­i­mal­ism and then clos­ing the Stella Jean show look­ing like an ethe­real pa­gan priest­ess.</p>
    <p>She also jet­ted to Si­cily last sum­mer with Dolce & Gab­bana to play an an­cient Ro­man war­rior in the brand’s Alta Moda out­ing.</p>
    <p>With less com­pe­ti­tion for at­ten­tion, the rar­i­fied world of haute cou­ture can be a great plat­form for nascent mod­els to prove their met­tle.</p>
    <p>Case in point: When Ric­cardo Tisci hand­picked a then-un­known Joan Smalls to walk his Givenchy haute cou­ture show, a star was fa­mously born.</p>
    <p>Duan got a taste of this when she be­came the only Sin­ga­porean model cho­sen by Dior to walk in a spe­cial show­ing of its spring/sum­mer 2018 haute cou­ture col­lec­tion in Shang­hai.</p>
    <p>“That was def­i­nitely one of the biggest highs of my ca­reer so far,” she says.</p>
    <p>At that show, she caught the eye of agents and cast­ing direc­tors, get­ting her­self signed to Women In New York soon after, and par­layed that into a run­way ap­pear­ance at Amer­i­can de­signer Casey Cad­wal­lader’s much-praised de­but at Mu­gler in Septem­ber 2018.</p>
    <p>“(Tele­vi­sion per­son­al­ity and model) Vi­o­let Chachki was there; (rap­per-ac­tress) Cardi B wore ‘my’ out­fit soon after – it was sur­real,” she adds.</p>
    <p>NO BED OF ROSES</p>
    <p>But as Duan would soon find out, the flip side of fash­ion’s rush of highs is its gut punch of lows.</p>
    <p>In an in­dus­try so driven by sub­jec­tive no­tions of ap­pear­ances, the re­jec­tion can take its toll.</p>
    <p>“I started com­par­ing my­self with other girls think­ing that I needed to be skin­nier even though I was al­ready thin. I started ob­ses­sively mon­i­tor­ing ev­ery­thing I ate. I wouldn’t eat more than 1,200 calo­ries a day and I went to the gym reli­giously – each time, I’d be there for more than two hours.</p>
    <p>“If I failed, I would feel so much guilt. It got so bad that I had an eat­ing disor­der and had to go to ther­apy,” she says of this dark point of her life.</p>
    <p>Re­al­is­ing she needed to fo­cus on her men­tal health be­fore all else, she “de­cided to take a break and come home. Be­fore this, I was liv­ing in Tokyo, South Korea, New York, Paris and Lon­don all within the</p>
