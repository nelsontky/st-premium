    <p>Hong Kong res­i­dents have gone on a spend­ing spree af­ter two months of be­ing cooped up at home, although it is not clear if this will be enough of a life­line to the re­tail and food and bev­er­age (F&B) sec­tor which re­mains among the worst hit by the Covid-19 pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Sales at K11 Musea, lo­cated in Tsim Sha Tsui, jumped by a fac­tor of seven last week­end com­pared to two weeks ago be­fore the grad­ual eas­ing of anti-pan­demic mea­sures.</p>
    <p>Mr Adrian Cheng, CEO of New World De­vel­op­ment and founder of K11 Group, at­trib­uted the spike to con­sumers’ pent-up ap­petite, as well as moves by the group to draw fre­quent cus­tomers.</p>
    <p>For the three months end­ing June, sales turnover at K11 shop­ping malls in the main­land soared 85 per cent quar­ter-on-quar­ter, while that at K11 Musea in Hong Kong was up 35 per cent.</p>
    <p>To­gether with its ten­ants, the group cre­ated a dig­i­tal ecosys­tem where it ran mul­ti­ple live stream­ing events on pop­u­lar so­cial me­dia plat­forms, in­clud­ing WeChat, as well as us­ing vir­tual re­al­ity tech­nol­ogy to help con­sumers pur­chase art­works.</p>
    <p>For July and Au­gust, the on­line sales chan­nels ac­counted for 15 per cent of to­tal sales at K11 malls in Hong Kong.</p>
    <p>Mr Cheng said: “As we en­ter the new nor­mal, we’re see­ing a new drive for ex­pe­ri­en­tial con­sump­tion – con­sumers who crave im­mer­sive shop­ping ex­pe­ri­ences that are ex­clu­sive and of­fer cu­rated con­tent and prod­ucts.”</p>
    <p>Con­sumer May Lai, 45, said her shop­ping ex­pen­di­ture has gone down this year be­cause she prefers go­ing to phys­i­cal stores.</p>
    <p>But with pub­lic gath­er­ings now capped at four and the Mid-Au­tumn Fes­ti­val on Oct 1, she has plans to ven­ture out more.</p>
    <p>She said: “My hus­band and I have been go­ing out these few weeks as we’ve not been out for such a long time, but it’s not as fre­quent as be­fore Covid-19.</p>
    <p>“Still, we want to play hard and spend hard. In the past few months, we have done less shop­ping so we are spend­ing more these two weeks.”</p>
    <p>The city’s eater­ies, though, are not ex­pect­ing a wind­fall dur­ing the Mid-Au­tumn fes­ti­val de­spite the eas­ing of re­stric­tions. Typ­i­cally, the fes­ti­val is a time when fam­i­lies hold big cel­e­bra­tions.</p>
    <p>“The fes­ti­val will not be of much help to restau­rants as sales of moon­cakes have been slow and book­ings for ta­bles have not been like in the past. There are no tourists and the ban on gath­er­ings of not more than four peo­ple re­mains, so all these will im­pact on spend­ing by fam­i­lies and compa</p>
    <p>Con­sumer spend­ing fell to this amount in the same month, con­tribut­ing to the 32.1 per cent fall in sales for the first seven months of the year com­pared to the same pe­riod in 2019. nies,” said Mr Kwok Wang Hing, chair­man of the Eat­ing Es­tab­lish­ment Em­ploy­ees Gen­eral Union.</p>
    <p>ING chief economist for Greater China Iris Pang be­lieves busi­nesses may not pick up so fast be­cause re­stric­tions had not been loos­ened fur­ther.</p>
    <p>She added that if land­lords were ex­pect­ing a loos­en­ing of so­cial dis­tanc­ing mea­sures soon, “then there may not be a lot of room for rent ne­go­ti­a­tion”. High rent has been a key con­cern of busi­nesses in the city.</p>
    <p>Tourism, hos­pi­tal­ity, re­tail and the F&B sec­tors have been hit the hard­est so far.</p>
    <p>Dragged down by a third wave of the pan­demic, Hong Kong’s re­tail sales shrank 23.1 per cent year on year in July, mak­ing it the 18th straight month of con­trac­tion.</p>
    <p>Con­sumer spend­ing dropped to HK$26.5 bil­lion (S$4.7 bil­lion) in the same month, con­tribut­ing to the 32.1 per cent fall in sales for the first seven months of the year com­pared to the same pe­riod in 2019, government data showed.</p>
    <p>In mid-Au­gust, the government re­vised its full-year growth fore­cast to an un­prece­dented low range of mi­nus 6 per cent to mi­nus 8 per cent.</p>
    <p>The un­em­ploy­ment rate has re­mained at 6.1 per cent for the three months end­ing Au­gust, data last week showed, with con­sump­tion and tourism-re­lated sec­tors, in­clud­ing re­tail and ac­com­mo­da­tion, hit hard the most by Covid-19.</p>
    <p>These sec­tors recorded a com­bined un­em­ploy­ment rate of 10.9 per cent for three months from June, the high­est since the Se­vere Acute Res­pi­ra­tory Syn­drome (Sars) out­break in 2003.</p>
    <p>This is de­spite the government hav­ing rolled out an un­prece­dented stim­u­lus pack­age amount­ing to more than HK$300 bil­lion as a life­line to busi­nesses and res­i­dents in the form of sub­si­dies and cash hand­outs.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, var­i­ous sec­tor heads have re­cently again urged the government to do more to help busi­nesses re­tain em­ploy­ees as the pan­demic drags on.</p>
