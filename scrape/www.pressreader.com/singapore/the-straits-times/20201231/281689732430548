    <p>The Covid-19 pan­demic threw a wicked curve­ball at the tourism in­dus­try this year when coun­tries closed their bor­ders to keep out the virus.</p>
    <p>As air travel dwin­dled to nearly noth­ing, na­tional car­rier Sin­ga­pore Air­lines recorded its first an­nual net loss in its 48-year his­tory.</p>
    <p>There were other reper­cus­sions – Sin­ga­pore’s at­trac­tions, ho­tels and tours no longer en­joyed the steady stream of vis­i­tors they once had.</p>
    <p>Some 13,400 vis­i­tors ar­rived in Sin­ga­pore in Oc­to­ber, a mere frac­tion of the 1.53 mil­lion in the same month last year.</p>
    <p>Tourist re­ceipts for the first half of the year also fell by 68.2 per cent to $4.2 bil­lion.</p>
    <p>Even travel stal­warts like STA Travel could not sur­vive the head­winds and those still in the game limp on.</p>
    <p>At gazetted ho­tels, the av­er­age oc­cu­pancy rate tum­bled by 30.3 per­cent­age points in Oc­to­ber from a year ago.</p>
    <p>To prop up the tourism sec­tor in Sin­ga­pore, the Govern­ment launched the $45 mil­lion Sin­gapoRedis­cov­ers cam­paign in July to drive lo­cal spend­ing in life­style and tourism busi­nesses amid a dearth of tourists here.</p>
    <p>The cam­paign by the Sin­ga­pore Tourism Board (STB), En­ter­prise Sin­ga­pore and Sen­tosa De­vel­op­ment Cor­po­ra­tion will last un­til June next year. It in­cludes deals for lo­cals, heart­land tours and the pro­mo­tion of precincts as mini-hol­i­day des­ti­na­tions.</p>
    <p>While Sin­ga­pore’s do­mes­tic mar­ket will not be enough to make up for the short­fall in tourist spend­ing, which amounted to $27.7 bil­lion last year, STB chief ex­ec­u­tive Keith Tan said the aim of the Sin­gapoRedis­cov­ers cam­paign is to chan­nel some of the un­used travel bud­gets Sin­ga­pore­ans set aside this year to lo­cal busi­nesses.</p>
    <p>In 2018, Sin­ga­pore­ans spent more than $34 bil­lion on over­seas travel.</p>
    <p>As part of the Sin­gapoRedis­cov­ers cam­paign, the STB inked some agree­ments, in­clud­ing a two-year mar­ket­ing part­ner­ship with on­line travel agency Ex­pe­dia. Stay­ca­tions and bun­dle deals for Sin­ga­pore­ans are avail­able on Ex­pe­dia’s web­site un­til April next year.</p>
    <p>An­other part­ner­ship be­tween the STB and DBS en­tails help­ing home-grown tourism providers in­te­grate dig­i­tal pay­ments into their busi­ness models.</p>
    <p>The STB is also work­ing with Amer­i­can aug­mented tech­nol­ogy com­pany Niantic on a Poke­mon Go tie-up.</p>
    <p>Three hun­dred new Pokestops and Gyms were launched on the smart­phone game in places such as ho­tels, re­tail­ers and eater­ies. Play­ers who go to these des­ti­na­tions will see an in-app ban­ner link­ing them to the Sin­gapoRedis­cov­ers site for tourism pro­mo­tions.</p>
    <p>An­other el­e­ment of the Sin­gapoRedis­cov­ers cam­paign was the Sin­gapol­i­days that were rolled out last month.</p>
    <p>These com­prise 50 bun­dled pro­mo­tions by ho­tels, at­trac­tions, tour op­er­a­tors, restau­rants and shops. One can, for in­stance, stay at a bou­tique ho­tel in Chi­na­town be­fore go­ing on a mys­tery-in­spired tour in the Keong Saik area.</p>
    <p>And kick­ing off this month was the $320 mil­lion Sin­gapoRedis­cov­ers voucher scheme to en­tice Sin­ga­pore­ans to ex­plore the city.</p>
    <p>All Sin­ga­pore­ans aged 18 and above have been given $100 each to spend on ho­tels, at­trac­tions and tours.</p>
    <p>The vouch­ers, which can be re­deemed un­til June 30 next year, can­not be used for re­tail shop pur­chases or food and bev­er­age, un­less they are part of a bun­dled pack­age, among other things.</p>
    <p>The STB hopes the vouch­ers will have a mul­ti­plier ef­fect on spend­ing at lo­cal mer­chants on the scheme.</p>
    <p>They had a promis­ing start, with some of­fer­ings by the five ap­pointed book­ing plat­forms sold out by mid­day when book­ings opened on Dec 1.</p>
    <p>By 4.30pm, more than 11,900 book­ings – to­talling about $1.86 mil­lion in vouch­ers and pay­ments – had been re­ceived, said the STB.</p>
    <p>Some of the most-booked at­trac­tions across book­ing plat­forms in­clude Gar­dens by the Bay, Univer­sal Stu­dios Sin­ga­pore and the Sin­ga­pore Zoo, and var­i­ous pack­ages – in­clud­ing combo bun­dles to Univer­sal Stu­dios and S.E.A. Aquar­ium – were quickly sold out on mul­ti­ple book­ing por­tals.</p>
    <p>Though the STB’s Mr Tan told in­dus­try lead­ers in Septem­ber to be pre­pared for a long win­ter, with in­ter­na­tional travel ex­pected to take three to five years to re­turn to pre-pan­demic lev­els, there are some bright spots.</p>
    <p>More than 8,600 new ho­tel rooms re­main in the pipe­line as at the third quar­ter of this year com­pared with 8,200 or so at the end of last year.</p>
    <p>Ho­tels can pro­vide guests with con­ducive work­ing spa­ces and well­ness ex­pe­ri­ences as peo­ple have be­come more health con­scious amid the pan­demic, said hote­liers, who re­main hope­ful about the in­dus­try’s abil­ity to re­cover and de­velop new prod­ucts for trav­ellers.</p>
    <p>In the mean­time, with phase three of Sin­ga­pore’s re­open­ing, lo­cals can now gather in groups of up to eight.</p>
    <p>At­trac­tions may now also op­er­ate at 65 per cent ca­pac­ity, up from the 50 per cent limit pre­vi­ously.</p>
    <p>As Covid-19 re­stric­tions are grad­u­ally eased, ho­tels, at­trac­tions and tour com­pa­nies can look for­ward to ac­com­mo­dat­ing more lo­cals, whose spend­ing may help off­set the losses suf­fered by busi­nesses dur­ing the pan­demic.</p>
