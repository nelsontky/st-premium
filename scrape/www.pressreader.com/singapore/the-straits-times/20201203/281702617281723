    <p>•</p>
    <p>WASHINGTON United States At­tor­ney-Gen­eral Wil­liam Barr says the Jus­tice De­part­ment has found no ev­i­dence of wide­spread voter fraud i n last month’s elec­tion, putting pres­sure on Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump to give up his quixotic ef­fort to over­turn Mr Joe Bi­den’s clear vic­tory.</p>
    <p>Mr Barr’s com­ments on Tues­day con­firmed the con­clu­sions of the De­part­ment of Home­land Se­cu­rity, US in­tel­li­gence and in­de­pen­dent poll watch­ers that the 2020 elec­tion was, in the lan­guage of gov­ern­ment of­fi­cials, the “most se­cure in Amer­i­can his­tory”.</p>
    <p>“To date, we have not seen fraud on a scale that could have ef­fected a dif­fer­ent out­come in the elec­tion,” he told the As­so­ci­ated Press.</p>
    <p>Mr Barr’s in­ter­view came as Mr Trump per­sisted in claim­ing, with­out ev­i­dence, that fraud­u­lent vot­ing prac­tices and sys­tems in key states such as Michi­gan, Penn­syl­va­nia and Ge­or­gia had robbed him of a sec­ond term.</p>
    <p>In tweets on Tues­day af­ter­noon, Mr Trump high­lighted tes­ti­mony be­ing of­fered in a pub­lic hear­ing on the elec­tion in Michi­gan, which has al­ready cer­ti­fied Mr Bi­den’s win in the state, and a sep­a­rate Repub­li­can-or­gan­ised event in Vir­ginia.</p>
    <p>“Peo­ple are com­ing for­ward like never be­fore. Large truck car­ry­ing hun­dreds of thou­sands of fraud­u­lent (fake) bal­lots to a vot­ing cen­tre? Ter­ri­ble – Save Amer­ica!” he wrote.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump’s at­tor­neys, led by Mr Rudy Gi­u­liani, have made nu­mer­ous al­le­ga­tions, rang­ing from bal­lot-box stuff­ing and fake bal­lot print­ing, to thou­sands of dead peo­ple hav­ing voted, to vote-count­ing ma­chines be­ing pro­grammed to favour Mr Bi­den.</p>
    <p>Sep­a­rately, on Tues­day, staunch</p>
    <p>Trump sup­porter and Se­nate Ma­jor­ity Leader Mitch McCon­nell gave his clear­est ac­knowl­edge­ment yet that Mr Bi­den would move into the White House next month.</p>
    <p>Dis­cussing stalled ne­go­ti­a­tions over a stim­u­lus pack­age to jump­start the virus-bat­tered US econ­omy, Mr McCon­nell said: “There’s likely to be a dis­cus­sion about some ad­di­tional pack­age of some size, de­pend­ing on what the new ad­min­is­tra­tion wants to pur­sue.”</p>
    <p>Re­cent news re­ports have said Mr Trump is un­happy with Mr Barr for not mak­ing ef­forts to sup­port his re-elec­tion.</p>
    <p>But, in a move likely to please Mr Trump, Mr Barr re­vealed on Tues­day that he had named an in­de­pen­dent spe­cial pros­e­cu­tor to in­ves­ti­gate the Jus­tice De­part­ment and</p>
    <p>Fed­eral Bureau of In­ves­ti­ga­tion in­ves­ti­ga­tors who probed links be­tween Mr Trump’s campaign and Rus­sia in the 2016 elec­tion.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump has claimed that those in­ves­ti­ga­tors, in­clud­ing for­mer spe­cial coun­sel Robert Mueller, were part of a cor­rupt, po­lit­i­cal “witch hunt” by the “deep state” to un­der­mine his ad­min­is­tra­tion.</p>
