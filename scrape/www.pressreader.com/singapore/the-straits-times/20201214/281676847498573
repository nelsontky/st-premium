    <p>BER­LIN • Ger­many will close most stores from Wed­nes­day un­til at least Jan 10, cut­ting short the busy Christmas shop­ping sea­son as it tight­ens coro­n­avirus re­stric­tions and tries to rein in the spread of the dis­ease, Chan­cel­lor An­gela Merkel said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>“I would have wished for lighter mea­sures. But due to Christmas shop­ping, the num­ber of so­cial con­tacts has risen con­sid­er­ably,” Dr Merkel told jour­nal­ists fol­low­ing a meet­ing with lead­ers of the coun­try’s 16 fed­eral states.</p>
    <p>“There is an ur­gent need to take ac­tion,” she said.</p>
    <p>A pol­icy paper agreed on by re­gional lead­ers and Dr Merkel said: “With in­creas­ing mo­bil­ity and the there­fore linked ad­di­tional con­tacts in the pre-Christmas pe­riod, Ger­many is now in ex­po­nen­tial growth of in­fec­tions num­bers.”</p>
    <p>Only es­sen­tial shops such as su­per­mar­kets and phar­ma­cies, as well as banks, are to re­main open from Wed­nes­day.</p>
    <p>Hair sa­lons, beauty sa­lons and tat­too par­lours will also have to shut.</p>
    <p>The govern­ment will sup­port af­fected com­pa­nies with a to­tal of around €11 bil­lion (S$17.8 bil­lion) a month. Busi­nesses that are forced to close may re­ceive up to 90 per cent of fixed costs, or up to €500,000 a month, Fi­nance Min­is­ter Olaf Scholz said.</p>
    <p>Schools will be closed in prin­ci­ple, and em­ploy­ers are asked to shut op­er­a­tions or have em­ploy­ees work from home.</p>
    <p>The sale of fire­works will be banned ahead of New Year’s Eve.</p>
    <p>Al­co­hol sales will be banned in pub­lic places, es­sen­tially out­law­ing the busi­ness of mulled wine</p>
    <p>stands, which have proved pop­u­lar in the days run­ning up to Christmas.</p>
    <p>Ger­many has been in par­tial lock­down for six weeks, with bars and restau­rants closed, while stores and schools have re­mained open.</p>
    <p>Some re­gions have al­ready im­posed tougher mea­sures as</p>
    <p>in­fec­tions grew.</p>
    <p>“‘Lock­down light’ has had an im­pact, but it was not suf­fi­cient,” Bavaria’s prime min­is­ter Markus Soeder said. “The sit­u­a­tion is out of con­trol.”</p>
    <p>Pri­vate gath­er­ings will re­main lim­ited to no more than five peo­ple from two house­holds.</p>
    <p>For the Christmas hol­i­days, the rule will be eased slightly so that fam­i­lies can cel­e­brate to­gether.</p>
    <p>Dr Merkel and Mr Soeder said it was too soon to say whether the econ­omy could re­open af­ter Jan 10.</p>
    <p>New daily in­fec­tions and deaths have reached records in re­cent</p>
    <p>days, and more politi­cians have been sound­ing the alarm.</p>
    <p>Ger­many, Europe’s largest econ­omy, was more suc­cess­ful than many Euro­pean coun­tries in keep­ing the pan­demic un­der con­trol dur­ing the first wave in March and April.</p>
    <p>But it has been strug­gling to turn</p>
    <p>the tide in the sec­ond wave.</p>
    <p>The num­ber of con­firmed coro­n­avirus cases in Ger­many in­creased by 20,200 to 1,320,716, data from the Robert Koch In­sti­tute for in­fec­tious dis­eases showed yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The re­ported death toll rose by 321 to 21,787, the tally showed.</p>
