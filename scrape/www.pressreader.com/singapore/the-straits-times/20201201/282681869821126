    <p>LON­DON • Net­flix hit se­ries The Crown should make clear that much of its con­tent is fic­tion over fears of dam­age to the im­age of the Bri­tish royal fam­ily, a gov­ern­ment min­is­ter said.</p>
    <p>“It’s a beau­ti­fully pro­duced work of fic­tion, so as with other TV pro­duc­tions, Net­flix should be very clear at the be­gin­ning it is just that,” Cul­ture Min­is­ter Oliver Dow­den told The Mail on Sun­day.</p>
    <p>“With­out this, I fear a gen­er­a­tion of view­ers who did not live through th­ese events may mis­take fic­tion for fact”.</p>
    <p>Mr Dow­den is ex­pected to for­mally write to the Amer­i­can stream­ing com­pany to re­quest it add a warn­ing be­fore each episode.</p>
    <p>Some of the lat­est episodes in the se­ries, which fol­lows the life of Queen El­iz­a­beth II and her close fam­ily, re­volve around Prince Charles and his doomed mar­riage to wife Diana.</p>
    <p>Those close to the royal fam­ily fear that fab­ri­cated scenes are hurt­ing the monar­chy, par­tic­u­larly heir to the throne Charles.</p>
    <p>“It is quite sin­is­ter the way that screen­writer Peter Mor­gan is clearly us­ing light en­ter­tain­ment to drive a very overt repub­li­can agenda and peo­ple just don’t see it,” an un­named friend of the prince told the pa­per.</p>
    <p>Al­though largely sym­pa­thetic to Diana, her brother Charles Spencer has also called for Net­flix to make clear some scenes are fic­tional.</p>
    <p>“It would help The Crown an enor­mous amount if at the be­gin­ning of each episode, it stated that ‘ this isn’t true, but is based on some real events’. Be­cause then ev­ery­one would un­der­stand it’s drama for drama’s sake,” Mr Spencer told ITV.</p>
    <p>English ac­tress Emma Cor­rin, who plays Diana in The Crown, has also re­sponded to crit­i­cism of her por­trayal of the beloved fig­ure.</p>
    <p>In a re­cent ap­pear­ance on the Tam­ron Hall Show, she ad­mit­ted that Mor­gan’s scripts are works of fic­tion, al­though the show has its roots in re­al­ity and in some fact.</p>
    <p>“I think for ev­ery­one in The Crown, we al­ways try and re­mind ev­ery­one that what we are, the se­ries that we’re in, is fic­tion­alised to a great ex­tent,” the 25-year-old ac­tress said on the talk show.</p>
    <p>More than 70 mil­lion house­holds world­wide have watched The Crown, which is in its fourth sea­son, since it be­gan in 2016, ac­cord­ing to fig­ures re­leased by Net­flix.</p>
