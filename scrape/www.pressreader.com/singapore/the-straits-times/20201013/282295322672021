    <p>• Bri­tish Cul­ture Sec­re­tary Oliver Dow­den has said that he fears Project Big Pic­ture, a pro­posal de­vised by Liver­pool and Manch­ester United and ap­proved by the English Foot­ball League, amounts to a “power grab” by the two of the rich­est clubs in the world.</p>
    <p>In re­turn for bail­ing out teams in the lower di­vi­sions – a £250 mil­lion (S$443.3 mil­lion) res­cue pack­age will be put to­gether to soften the im­pact of zero match-day rev­enue – the two teams, along with Ar­se­nal, Manch­ester City, Chelsea, Tot­ten­ham, Ever­ton, Southamp­ton and West Ham, will be granted “spe­cial sta­tus” over how the top flight should be run.</p>
    <p>How­ever, the rad­i­cal pro­posal has al­ready been met by op­po­si­tion from the Premier League, alarmed by the mo­tion to re­duce the com­pe­ti­tion from 20 to 18 clubs, and axe the League Cup and Com­mu­nity Shield for the 2022-23 sea­son.</p>
    <p>Other mea­sures in­clude get­ting rid of the 14-vote thresh­old needed for a res­o­lu­tion to pass, putting in place new rules for dis­tri­bu­tion of Premier League in­come, do­ing away with para­chute pay­ments for rel­e­gated teams, and re­mov­ing the one club, one vote sys­tem – in place since the top flight’s in­cep­tion 28 years ago.</p>
    <p>The plan was first re­ported by The Tele­graph on Sun­day and in re­sponse, the Premier League said “a num­ber of the in­di­vid­ual pro­pos­als in the plan pub­lished could have a dam­ag­ing im­pact on the whole game and we are dis­ap­pointed to see that Rick Parry, chair of the English Foot­ball League, has given his on-the-record sup­port”.</p>
    <p>Asked by Sky News whether the plan that will change the gov­er­nance of the sport was meant to pro­tect smaller clubs or amounted to a “power grab” by Premier League giants, Mr Dow­den replied yes­ter­day: “I fear it’s the lat­ter.</p>
    <p>“I’m quite scep­ti­cal about this. I’m afraid if we keep hav­ing these back-room deals and all these other things go­ing on, we will have to look again at the un­der­ly­ing gov­er­nance of foot­ball.”</p>
    <p>Mr Dow­den also said the rul­ing</p>
    <p>Con­ser­va­tive Party had promised a fan-led re­view of English foot­ball in its election man­i­festo last year, and that re­cent events “have made this seem more ur­gent”.</p>
    <p>Bri­tish Prime Min­is­ter Boris John­son’s spokesman James Slack agreed, say­ing: “It’s clear that this pro­posal does not com­mand sup­port through­out the Premier League and it is ex­actly this type of back­room deal­ing that un­der­mines trust in foot­ball’s gov­er­nance.”</p>
    <p>The plan, which has been in the works since Jan­uary, has drawn a mixed re­ac­tion since Sun­day.</p>
    <p>Chair­man of League Two out­fit For­est Green Rovers, Dale Vince, is in favour of the “very well-rounded and fair packet of changes”, while pun­dit Gary Neville said “there is too much good in this to dis­miss it”.</p>
    <p>But West Ham were re­port­edly not con­sulted de­spite be­ing named in the plan and so are against it, ac­cord­ing to the BBC, while pun­dits like for­mer Eng­land boss Steve Mc­Claren have called it “fright­en­ing”.</p>
    <p>As things stand, the plan needs 14 votes to pass, but should it get the green light, from the 2022-23 sea­son, power will be con­cen­trated in the hands of the nine clubs, with only six of them need­ing to vote for ma­jor change.</p>
    <p>It is not known what will hap­pen if the project is re­jected, but the Premier League is set to con­vene an emer­gency meet­ing in mid­week, ac­cord­ing to The Times of Lon­don.</p>
    <p>Re­gard­less, for­mer Liver­pool and Premier League chief ex­ec­u­tive Parry has vowed to push ahead, claim­ing the re­forms will be for “the good of English foot­ball”.</p>
