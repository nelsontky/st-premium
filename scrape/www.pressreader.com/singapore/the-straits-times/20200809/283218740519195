    <p>The savers are get­ting rest­less.</p>
    <p>Run­ning out of guar­an­teed ways to get mean­ing­ful re­turns, some peo­ple are in­creas­ingly be­ing tempted to raid their in­ter­est-earn­ing cash sav­ings to load up on as­sets such as bit­coin, gold and stocks.</p>
    <p>The com­fort­able, if small, re­turns of high-yield sav­ings ac­counts are look­ing less palat­able as volatile as­sets take off.</p>
    <p>Mr Brian Har­ring­ton, 28, had been sat­is­fied with a high-yield sav­ings ac­count at Ally Bank, earn­ing a risk-free 2 per cent. But the mar­ket­ing con­sul­tant in Ana­heim, Cal­i­for­nia, is now plan­ning to con­vert his re­main­ing US$15,000 (S$20,500) in sav­ings into bit­coin. He thinks the fu­ture is one of long-term eco­nomic stag­na­tion and low rates.</p>
    <p>“I’m not root­ing for Dooms­day,” he said. “But you have to keep search­ing for yields.” The last few months have, in some re­spects, been a boon for ac­count bal­ances.</p>
    <p>Lock­downs across the US to slow the spread of Covid-19 have cut con­sumer spend­ing.</p>
    <p>The per­sonal sav­ings rate rose to a record 32.2 per cent in April.</p>
    <p>Mint, a fi­nan­cial plan­ning plat­form, told Bloomberg its cus­tomers de­posited 16 per cent more in their ac­counts be­tween March and June against the same pe­riod last year. There’s one prob­lem: Now isn’t a great time to hold onto money.</p>
    <p>It had be­come stan­dard ad­vice in per­sonal fi­nance fo­rums to keep ex­tra cash in high-yield sav­ings ac­counts, but the rates on those have fallen steadily. Pop­u­lar brands such as Ally and Mar­cus – the con­sumer arm of Gold­man Sachs Group – of­fered rates in July of 1 per cent and 1.05 per cent, re­spec­tively; both were over 2 per cent a lit­tle over a year ago, when the US Fed­eral Re­serve cut rates for the first time since the 2008 fi­nan­cial cri­sis.</p>
    <p>“Some banks will drag their feet a bit to stand out from the crowd, but they’re all work­ing their way down,” said Mr Greg McBride, chief fi­nan­cial an­a­lyst at Bankrate.com.</p>
    <p>There’s no guar­an­tee that yields for these ac­counts will re­bound soon. Other tra­di­tion­ally safe ve­hi­cles have taken a hit as well. The aver­age rate for five-year cer­tifi­cate of de­posits is 0.47 per cent, down from 1.88 per cent the same pe­riod last year, ac­cord­ing to Fed­eral De­posit In­sur­ance Corp data.</p>
    <p>Bit­coin is up about 55 per cent this year, while gold has risen about 30 per cent, smash­ing the record set in 2011, as in­vestors flock to the pre­cious metal as a hedge against in­fla­tion. Stocks have surged since bot­tom­ing out at the start of the coro­n­avirus out­break in the US: From March 23 to July 1, the S&P 500 ral­lied 40 per cent, its best 100-day per­for­mance since 1933, ac­cord­ing to Be­spoke In­vest­ment Group.</p>
    <p>The once-in-a-cen­tury rally has given Amer­i­cans con­fi­dence about the mar­ket in the long run. A sur­vey by Bankrate found 28 per cent of Amer­i­cans say­ing the stock mar­ket was their top choice for long-term in­vest­ments, up from 20 per cent last year. Only 18 per cent of re­spon­dents chose cash in­vest­ments such as sav­ings ac­counts.</p>
    <p>The re­sults are a re­mark­able shift to­wards risk, Mr McBride said, not­ing that in pre­vi­ous sur­veys, stocks came in a “dis­tant third” to real es­tate and cash sav­ings.</p>
    <p>For Seat­tle soft­ware engi­neer Meyer Den­ney, sav­ing to buy a new house within the next five years means strik­ing a del­i­cate bal­ance be­tween cer­tainty and up­side.</p>
    <p>The 35-year-old is look­ing at funds that in­vest in con­sumer sta­ples, or cor­po­rate bonds that don’t carry the same volatil­ity as typ­i­cal stocks or in­dex funds.</p>
    <p>“I’m wor­ried that in three years we see our dream house but then the mar­ket tanks 10 or 15 per cent,” Mr Den­ney said. “So I’m try­ing to err on the safer side.”</p>
    <p>Even in nor­mal con­di­tions, fi­nan­cial ad­vis­ers rec­om­mend hav­ing a cash re­serve of sev­eral months of ex­penses. In the mid­dle of an eco­nomic down­turn and a pan­demic, that need for a cush­ion only rises.</p>
    <p>“Given the pre­car­i­ous state of the econ­omy and height­ened risk of in­cur­ring out-of-pocket med­i­cal ex­penses, it’s still im­por­tant to have emer­gency funds in cheque or sav­ings ac­counts,” said se­nior econ­o­mist Heidi Shier­holz at the Eco­nomic Pol­icy In­sti­tute.</p>
