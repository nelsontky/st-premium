    <p>The Sin­ga­pore Premier League (SPL) re­sumes af­ter more than 200 days on Satur­day with strict mea­sures in place to en­sure the safety of about 100 key per­son­nel present at each of the games, in­clud­ing stag­gered en­trances and ex­its as well as sep­a­rate zones. Teams can make up to five sub­sti­tu­tions and there will be com­pul­sory wa­ter breaks mid­way through each half.</p>
    <p>Strict safety pro­to­cols will be im­ple­mented on match days when the Sin­ga­pore Premier League (SPL) re­sumes on Satur­day af­ter a sus­pen­sion of more than 200 days due to the coro­n­avirus pan­demic.</p>
    <p>At a vir­tual meet­ing with of­fi­cials from the nine clubs yes­ter­day, the Foot­ball As­so­ci­a­tion of Sin­ga­pore (FAS) dis­closed these mea­sures – as ad­vised by the Health Pro­mo­tion Board, Min­istry of Health (MOH) and Sport Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>On Satur­day, Tampines Rovers will host Hougang United at Our Tampines Hub, while Tan­jong Pa­gar take on Balestier Khalsa at Jurong East Sta­dium.</p>
    <p>Both games will kick off at 5.30pm be­hind closed doors with just un­der 100 peo­ple, in­clud­ing play­ers, of­fi­cials, med­i­cal and match day staff, and broad­cast and me­dia work­ers, al­lowed in­side.</p>
    <p>In or­der to avoid con­gre­ga­tion at any point at the sta­di­ums, en­try to the venues will be stag­gered across a five-hour pe­riod be­fore kick-off. Sim­i­larly, de­par­ture af­ter the match will also be spread over a one-hour pe­riod af­ter the final whis­tle.</p>
    <p>Five zones – broad­cast­ing, stands (stag­gered ar­eas in spec­ta­tor stands), en­trance, of­fi­cial area (tun­nel, dress­ing room) and field of play – are also es­tab­lished at sta­di­ums, where ac­cess will be con­trolled to pre­vent in­ter­min­gling.</p>
    <p>Ex­cept for play­ers and match of­fi­cials who are in ac­tion dur­ing the game or warm-up, ev­ery­one else are to wear masks while they are in the sta­di­ums.</p>
    <p>While all 223 lo­cal-based play­ers and match of­fi­cials tested neg­a­tive for Covid-19 on Oct 4, they will un­dergo swab tests ev­ery two weeks. Any­one who tests pos­i­tive from this group will have to im­me­di­ately self-iso­late and fol­low the stan­dard op­er­at­ing pro­ce­dures es­tab­lished by MOH.</p>
    <p>All clubs are re­quired to com­plete and sub­mit dec­la­ra­tion forms to FAS for all play­ers, coaches and of­fi­cials a day be­fore a match.</p>
    <p>They will have to check their tem­per­a­ture twice – two days and one day be­fore the match – and any­one with a tem­per­a­ture of 38 deg C or higher will not be al­lowed to par­tic­i­pate.</p>
    <p>Like­wise, any­one who has trav­elled out of Sin­ga­pore 14 days be­fore a match, or who has been in con­tact with any­one who is Covid-19 pos­i­tive or serv­ing a stay­home notice, will also be barred.</p>
    <p>FAS chief of the gen­eral sec­re­tary’s of­fice Ger­ard Christo­pher said: “It is im­per­a­tive that ev­ery sin­gle per­son in­volved on match days upon the SPL’s re­sump­tion strictly ad­heres to these pro­to­cols, as they are nec­es­sary in or­der to safe­guard the well-be­ing of ev­ery­one.</p>
    <p>“As the first lo­cal pro­fes­sional league com­pe­ti­tion to be al­lowed to re­sume, the FAS recog­nises the re­spon­si­bil­ity it bears to en­sure that the league is able to func­tion as smoothly and safely as pos­si­ble, with the in­her­ent safety mea­sures.”</p>
    <p>In ad­di­tion, the FAS also told the clubs about sev­eral amend­ments made to the laws of the game for the rest of the SPL sea­son which are aligned with leagues across the world.</p>
    <p>One key change is that the max­i­mum num­ber of sub­sti­tu­tions teams can make dur­ing a game has been in­creased from three to five.</p>
    <p>Out­side of the half-time break, teams will be al­lowed a max­i­mum of three sub­sti­tu­tion win­dows dur­ing the first and sec­ond halves.</p>
    <p>Manda­tory wa­ter breaks will also be in­tro­duced to help play­ers as they re­turn to the full rigours of ac­tion af­ter a hia­tus of al­most seven months.</p>
    <p>The one-minute breaks will take place in the 25th and 70th min­utes, and play­ers are to drink from per­son­alised bot­tles.</p>
    <p>Gey­lang In­ter­na­tional coach Noor Ali feels the mea­sures are ad­e­quate in en­sur­ing a safe re­turn to the SPL.</p>
    <p>He added: “We are re­sum­ing the league with a pre­sea­son that is not nor­mal. The play­ers may be phys­i­cally fit, but not match fit as we did not have any friendly matches.”</p>
    <p>The in­crease in the num­ber of sub­sti­tu­tions is im­por­tant to re­duce the pos­si­bil­ity of in­juries in “a fast and fu­ri­ous sea­son”, par­tic­u­larly in the first round, he said.</p>
    <p>“It will be a dif­fer­ent ex­pe­ri­ence and it will be in­ter­est­ing to see the ef­fects on each club and how each club adapt to the changes.”</p>
    <p>Due to the coro­n­avirus-en­forced break, the SPL sea­son will be short­ened from three rounds of matches to two rounds, while the Sin­ga­pore Cup has been can­celled.</p>
    <p>INTO THE UN­KNOWN</p>
    <p>We are re­sum­ing the league with a pre­sea­son that is not nor­mal. The play­ers may be phys­i­cally fit, but not match fit as we did not have any friendly matches.</p>
    <p>NOOR ALI, Gey­lang In­ter­na­tional coach, on the moves to have five sub­sti­tutes and wa­ter breaks dur­ing a match.</p>
