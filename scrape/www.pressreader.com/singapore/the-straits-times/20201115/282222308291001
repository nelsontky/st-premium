    <p>Tucked in a cor­ner of Yo­tel Sin­ga­pore’s in-house restau­rant-cum-bar Komyuniti, this co-work­ing space in Or­chard Road works be­cause it was built for that from the get-go.</p>
    <p>With com­pact rooms, com­mu­nal work spa­ces have al­ways been part of the brand’s de­sign, says gen­eral man­ager Bren­dan Daly. The ho­tel launched its Grind and Dine co-work­ing pack­age last month.</p>
    <p>OF­FICE FOR THE DAY</p>
    <p>A meet­ing room, in­di­vid­ual ta­bles and sofa seats are all part of a small co-work­ing space called the Komyuniti Stu­dio, which seats 10. It is seg­re­gated from the restau­rant with black mesh di­viders, which of­fer pri­vacy.</p>
    <p>I pull up a chair at a long wooden ta­ble where am­ple power sock­ets nes­tle neatly be­neath. Floor-to-ceil­ing glass pan­els over­look the pool deck, the blues and greens a re­fresh­ing change from por­ing over Google doc­u­ments.</p>
    <p>Other­wise, there are few dis­trac­tions. Only one other per­son is there for the du­ra­tion of my week­day after­noon visit. As the space is par­tially ob­scured, staff thought­fully place a call but­ton next to me and a pitcher of wa­ter at the next ta­ble.</p>
    <p>FEEL­ING PECKISH?</p>
    <p>Start­ing at $40 for four hours, pack­ages here are the prici­est among the four re­viewed, but you do get ev­ery dol­lar back in meal cred­its. A full-day pack­age comes with $60 of meal cred­its, which are enough for lunch, din­ner and then some.</p>
    <p>The menu is ex­ten­sive and well-ex­e­cuted, in­clud­ing a warm rice bowl with well-mar­i­nated teriyaki chicken ($18) and a juicy beef burger slathered with ba­con jam ($24).</p>
    <p>Keep the munchies at bay with a side of fried brus­sel sprouts ($9), topped with crispy ba­con and tangy hot sauce. It does not pre­tend to be healthy, but is a tasty way to get in your greens. The pot­ted plant tiramisu ($18), as large as an ac­tual planter, is a hefty dessert enough for two.</p>
    <p>A free flow of cof­fee, tea, soft drinks and juices is also in­cluded in the pack­age.</p>
    <p>PERKS</p>
    <p>Black-and-white print­ing is com­pli­men­tary, up to a max­i­mum of 30 pages.</p>
