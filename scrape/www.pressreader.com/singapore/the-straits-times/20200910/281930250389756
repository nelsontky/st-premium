    <p>WASH­ING­TON • The US Jus­tice De­part­ment is seek­ing to take over the de­fence of Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump in a defama­tion suit brought by ad­vice colum­nist E. Jean Car­roll, who claims Mr Trump raped her two decades ago.</p>
    <p>The move could fur­ther de­lay a suit in which Ms Car­roll is de­mand­ing po­ten­tially dam­ag­ing ev­i­dence from Mr Trump dur­ing the fi­nal weeks be­fore the pres­i­den­tial elec­tion, in­clud­ing a de­po­si­tion and a DNA sam­ple to com­pare with a dress she claims she was wear­ing at the time of the al­leged at­tack. It could also leave tax­pay­ers on the hook for any dam­ages awarded in the case.</p>
    <p>In a court fil­ing on Tues­day, the</p>
    <p>Jus­tice De­part­ment said Mr Trump was act­ing “within the scope” of his job as Pres­i­dent when he said Ms Car­roll lied about the in­ci­dent, prompt­ing her law­suit. If ap­proved by a judge, the re­spon­si­bil­ity for de­fend­ing the case and pay­ing for any judg­ment would fall on the US gov­ern­ment.</p>
    <p>The US also moved the case to the</p>
    <p>Man­hat­tan fed­eral court from a New York state court, where a judge last month de­nied his re­quest to stall the suit.</p>
    <p>“To­day’s ac­tions demon­strate that Trump will do ev­ery­thing pos­si­ble, in­clud­ing us­ing the full pow­ers of the fed­eral gov­ern­ment, to block dis­cov­ery from go­ing for­ward in my case be­fore the up­com­ing elec­tion, to try to pre­vent a jury from ever de­cid­ing which one of us is ly­ing,” Ms Car­roll said in a state­ment on Tues­day.</p>
    <p>It is not clear why the Jus­tice De­part­ment is only now seek­ing to take over Mr Trump’s de­fence of the suit, which was filed last Novem­ber.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump, who has de­nied rap­ing Ms Car­roll, has been rep­re­sented in the case by his long­time out­side lawyer Marc Ka­sowitz.</p>
    <p>The move comes as the Trump cam­paign has re­port­edly been fac­ing a cash crunch due in part to its spend­ing on le­gal fees de­fend­ing suits against the Pres­i­dent.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to The New York Times, Mr Ka­sowitz has been paid more than US$820,000 (S$1.1 mil­lion) from cam­paign funds, though it is not clear if that money was re­lated to his work on Ms Car­roll’s suit.</p>
    <p>Ms Car­roll’s lawyer, Ms Roberta Ka­plan, said in a state­ment that she would fight the Jus­tice De­part­ment fil­ing.</p>
    <p>Ms Ka­plan said the Jus­tice De­part­ment move came on the dead­line for Mr Trump to ap­peal against the state court judge’s rul­ing re­quir­ing him to pro­vide ev­i­dence.</p>
    <p>“Trump’s ef­fort to wield the power of the US gov­ern­ment to evade re­spon­si­bil­ity for his pri­vate mis­con­duct is with­out prece­dent, and shows even more starkly how far he is will­ing to go to pre­vent the truth from com­ing out,” Ms Ka­plan said.</p>
