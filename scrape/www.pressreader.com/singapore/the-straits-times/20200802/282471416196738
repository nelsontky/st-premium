    <p>March 21 - April 19</p>
    <p>Make big plans – things are still going your way, but if you do not cap­i­talise on this mo­men­tum, you are sure to fall be­hind in the long run. Think things through.</p>
    <p>April 20 - May 20</p>
    <p>Deal with some­one whose ex­treme lev­els of weird­ness are mak­ing your life more dif­fi­cult. It is as sim­ple as walk­ing away, though you may feel the need to take re­spon­si­bil­ity and let him know.</p>
    <p>May 21 - June 20</p>
    <p>Shake up your per­spec­tive. That could mean you have to start ask­ing big ques­tions of those around you. It is time for a new point of view, even if it is sim­i­lar to your own.</p>
    <p>June 21 - July 22</p>
    <p>You need to do some men­tal yoga to make it through the day, but you can man­age. It is a great time to learn some new tricks and see if you can sur­prise friends or col­leagues.</p>
    <p>July 23 - Aug 22</p>
    <p>Take a deep breath and wait this phase out. You need to make sure you are not show­ing how im­pa­tient you feel. That just causes stress, which slows things down even fur­ther.</p>
    <p>Aug 23 - Sept 22</p>
    <p>Keep your mes­sages pos­i­tive and make sure peo­ple re­ally un­der­stand that you are on their side – well, as long as you ac­tu­ally are. Crit­i­cism can be shared later.</p>
    <p>Sept 23 - Oct 22</p>
    <p>You need to be more un­der­stand­ing, and that is ac­tu­ally pos­si­ble. For­tu­nately, your great spir­i­tual and so­cial en­er­gies are in sync, so you should not have a hard time read­ing peo­ple.</p>
    <p>Oct 23 - Nov 21</p>
    <p>You have to lis­ten, even though your in­ner alarm bells are ring­ing. That just means you re­ally need to pay at­ten­tion. There will be at least one in­sane idea that is per­fect for you.</p>
    <p>Nov 22 - Dec 21</p>
    <p>Re­ally fo­cus. Peo­ple are sure to spout off sug­ges­tions that sound in­cred­u­lous, but at least one of them is a win­ner. You have the power to sink it or let it flour­ish. Dec 22 - Jan 19</p>
    <p>You need a change, but that does not mean you need to move to a new country or join a monastery. Fig­ure out the best way to move in a slightly new di­rec­tion, then com­mit yourself to it.</p>
    <p>Jan 20 - Feb 18</p>
    <p>You feel hot and you look it, too. Your amaz­ing personal en­ergy is mak­ing you glow, so flaunt it or just en­joy it while it lasts. It is a good time to meet new peo­ple.</p>
    <p>Feb 19 - March 20</p>
    <p>Change is com­ing. If you can pre­pare yourself even a lit­tle, you should be fine, though it may come more sud­denly than you like. Things are sure to get more in­ter­est­ing after you set­tle down.</p>
