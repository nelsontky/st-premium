    <p>NEW YORK • If we want to walk eas­ily and well as we age, we may need to do more than just stroll now, ac­cord­ing to an eye-open­ing new study of older walk­ers and cy­clists. The study finds that peo­ple who of­ten cycle for ex­er­cise can walk more ef­fi­ciently than peo­ple whose pri­mary ex­er­cise is placid walk­ing, even if ev­ery­one works out for the same amount of time.</p>
    <p>The re­sults, which build on ear­lier work in­volv­ing walk­ers and run­ners, raise i mpor­tant ques­tions about whether gen­tle ex­er­cise, by it­self, is enough for our well-be­ing or if we might need, at least some­times, to add oomph to our work­outs.</p>
    <p>In gen­eral, ex­er­cise sci­ence shows that do­ing some­thing – any­thing – phys­i­cal is much bet­ter for our health and longevity than do­ing noth­ing. A raft of epi­demi­o­log­i­cal stud­ies in­di­cate that if men and women start mov­ing just enough to lift them­selves out of the group of peo­ple who are the most seden­tary, they get greater re­duc­tions in their risks for chronic dis­eases and pre­ma­ture death than if a marathon run­ner crams in a few ad­di­tional, weekly kilo­me­tres.</p>
    <p>But most of us are not com­pletely in­ac­tive or in con­stant mo­tion and, for us, many ques­tions re­main about the ideal mix of du­ra­tion, in­ten­sity or type of ex­er­cise to el­e­vate our fit­ness and health. Can we get away with an oc­ca­sional am­ble around the block? Or should we keep go­ing for a longer pe­riod? And is it im­por­tant to in­ten­tion­ally get out of breath on oc­ca­sion?</p>
    <p>In­trigued by those con­cerns, a group of ex­er­cise sci­en­tists at Hum­boldt State Univer­sity in Cal­i­for­nia and the Univer­sity of Colorado at Boul­der be­gan to won­der re­cently about walk­ing and whether it might tell us some­thing about work­outs and ideal in­ten­si­ties.</p>
    <p>In gen­eral, most of us can walk from the time we are tod­dlers and prob­a­bly ex­pect to con­tinue to be able to walk for most of our lives.</p>
    <p>But past biome­chan­ics stud­ies show that peo­ple tend to be­come phys­i­o­log­i­cally in­ef­fi­cient walk­ers with age, us­ing more oxy­gen to walk at the same pace as younger peo­ple. In prac­ti­cal terms, this ris­ing in­ef­fi­ciency would make walk­ing feel harder and more tir­ing, per­haps prompt­ing older peo­ple to walk less, sit more and po­ten­tially be­come frail.</p>
    <p>The re­searchers spec­u­lated that ex­er­cise might main­tain walk­ing ef­fi­ciency in older peo­ple, although what type of ex­er­cise was not clear. So, for a study pub­lished in 2014 in PLoS One – an open ac­cess peer-re­viewed sci­en­tific jour­nal pub­lished by the Pub­lic Li­brary of Sci­ence (PLoS) – they in­vited healthy walk­ers and run­ners who were 65 or older to the lab and asked them to walk on a tread­mill at var­i­ous speeds while wear­ing head­gear to mea­sure their oxy­gen con­sump­tion.</p>
    <p>They then com­pared the run­ners’ and walk­ers’ ef­fi­ciency and cross­checked those re­sults against sim­i­lar data from ear­lier ex­per­i­ments with seden­tary col­lege stu­dents and re­tirees. It turned out that older run­ners were quite ef­fi­cient walk­ers, us­ing about the same amount of oxy­gen to walk as young peo­ple. But the older walk­ers had lost a step, phys­i­o­log­i­cally, re­quir­ing about 7 to 10 per cent more oxy­gen to walk at the same pace as the run­ners or the stu­dents. Their ef­fi­ciency matched that of the older men and women who rarely ex­er­cised.</p>
    <p>For the new study, which was pub­lished in July in the Jour­nal of Age­ing and Phys­i­cal Ac­tiv­ity, the re­searchers set out to see if a dif­fer­ent ex­er­cise, in this case cy­cling, might like­wise af­fect the ease of walk­ing.</p>
    <p>They re­cruited older rid­ers and walk­ers and asked them how stren­u­ously they felt they worked out, on a scale of one to three, from easy to tir­ing. The walk­ers’ re­ported in­ten­sity hov­ered at just un­der two, while the cy­clists’, as a group, neared three. The re­searchers also brought in a group of healthy young peo­ple as a con­trol.</p>
    <p>Ev­ery­one then walked on a tread­mill at paces rang­ing up to over 6kmh while the re­searchers tracked their oxy­gen con­sump­tion. As with the run­ners, the older cy­clists walked well, their ef­fi­ciency match­ing that of the young peo­ple. But the older walk­ers’ ef­fi­ciency was as much as 17 per cent lower.</p>
    <p>In ef­fect, walk­ing for ex­er­cise seemed not to have “sup­plied suf­fi­cient phys­i­cal stim­u­lus” to main­tain peo­ple’s abil­ity to walk eas­ily as they aged, says Jus­tus Ortega, a pro­fes­sor at Hum­boldt who co-au­thored both stud­ies. Run­ning and cy­cling were as­so­ci­ated with more ef­fi­cient walk­ing than reg­u­lar walk­ing was.</p>
    <p>The stud­ies did not delve into how cy­cling or run­ning might have af­fected peo­ple’s walk­ing ef­fi­ciency. But Dr Ortega says he and col­leagues sus­pect that the more de­mand­ing ex­er­tions boosted the health and func­tion of mi­to­chon­dria inside mus­cle cells in ways that gen­tler walk­ing did not. Mi­to­chon­dria af­fect how cells make and utilise en­ergy. Health­ier mi­to­chon­dria should con­trib­ute to more ef­fi­cient move­ment.</p>
    <p>These stud­ies were sin­gle snap­shots of peo­ple’s lives, and do not show that run­ning or cy­cling di­rectly caused peo­ple to be ef­fi­cient walk­ers, only that the ac­tiv­i­ties were re­lated. They also did not look at mid­dle-aged peo­ple and whether dif­fer­ent types of ex­er­cise might af­fect how well peo­ple walk later.</p>
    <p>But Dr Ortega be­lieves the stud­ies’ find­ings can be both cau­tion­ary and en­cour­ag­ing, sug­gest­ing that, while any phys­i­cal ac­tiv­ity is worth­while, push­ing your­self a bit now might yield last­ing ben­e­fits for health and mo­bil­ity.</p>
    <p>So, if you cur­rently stroll for ex­er­cise, he says, per­haps con­sider cy­cling or jog­ging some­times, too, if pos­si­ble. Or add hills to your usual walk­ing route, or, at least for a block or three, pick up the pace.</p>
