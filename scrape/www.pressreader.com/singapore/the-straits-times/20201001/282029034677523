    <p>Home Team NS has opened its lat­est club­house in Khatib, with new fa­cil­i­ties that can be en­joyed by both Home Team op­er­a­tionally ready na­tional ser­vice­men and mem­bers of the pub­lic alike.</p>
    <p>The lo­ca­tion in Yishun is a five-storey, 21,000 sq m com­plex that is home to Ad­ven­ture HQ, a four-storey in­door hub that is heaven for adren­a­line junkies. It has 10 sta­tions, in­clud­ing a ninja-war­rior-style ob­sta­cle course, speed-climb­ing walls and rap­pelling ae­rial in­stal­la­tions.</p>
    <p>The club­house also boasts a 14m in­door slide, one of the long­est in Sin­ga­pore, a fully equip­ped gym with a 300-per­son ca­pac­ity and an Olympic-size swim­ming pool.</p>
    <p>A new, com­pul­sory, na­tional longterm care in­surance comes into force to­day for all res­i­dents born in 1980 or later. Called CareShield Life, it pro­vides pay­outs for peo­ple who are se­verely dis­abled. Straits Times se­nior health cor­re­spon­dent Salma Kha­lik an­swers ques­tions on this new scheme.</p>
    <p>Q I al­ready have MediShield Life. Why do I need CareShield Life?</p>
    <p>A The two in­surance schemes are com­pletely dif­fer­ent.</p>
    <p>MediShield Life is for acute med­i­cal needs, and cov­ers big hos­pi­tal bills and cer­tain ma­jor out­pa­tient treat­ments such as chemo­ther­apy for can­cer.</p>
    <p>Should the med­i­cal prob­lem in­volve se­vere dis­abil­ity, MediShield Life does not pay for con­tin­ued out­pa­tient treat­ment or care, be­yond the hos­pi­tal stay.</p>
    <p>CareShield Life, on the other hand, is catered for long-term dis­abil­ity. It will pay a fixed monthly amount of at least $600 for the du­ra­tion of the dis­abil­ity, even if it is for the rest of the per­son’s life.</p>
    <p>There is no re­stric­tion on how the re­cip­i­ent uses the money.</p>
    <p>Q What sort of se­vere dis­abil­ity qual­i­fies for pay­out un­der CareShield Life?</p>
    <p>A Pay­out is given to a per­son who is not able to per­form three of the six ac­tiv­i­ties of daily liv­ing with­out as­sis­tance. The ac­tiv­i­ties are wash­ing, dress­ing, eat­ing, go­ing to the toi­let, walk­ing or mov­ing around, and mov­ing from bed to chair and vice versa.</p>
    <p>Q How does some­one ap­ply for the pay­outs?</p>
    <p>A The per­son needs to be seen by a se­vere dis­abil­ity asses­sor who is ac­cred­ited by the Min­istry of Health. Assessors in­clude doc­tors, trained ther­a­pists and nurses.</p>
    <p>If the per­son qual­i­fies for a pay­out, the ap­pli­ca­tion has to be sub­mit­ted to the Agency for In­te­grated Care.</p>
    <p>The as­sess­ment is free the first time, but a $100 to $250 fee ap­plies for a sec­ond as­sess­ment.</p>
    <p>This could hap­pen if the per­son did not qual­ify for a pay­out, but later, the con­di­tion de­te­ri­o­rates and a sec­ond ap­pli­ca­tion is made. Once a per­son starts get­ting pay­outs, he no longer needs to pay any pre­mi­ums.</p>
    <p>Q Why is the pay­out “at least $600” a month? What de­cides the ac­tual amount peo­ple get?</p>
    <p>A The amount of pay­out goes up ev­ery year to keep abreast of in­fla­tion. In the first year, the pay­out is $600 a month. It will go up by 2 per cent a year for the first five years.</p>
    <p>The in­creases af­ter that will be de­cided by the CareShield Life Coun­cil.</p>
    <p>Once a per­son starts re­ceiv­ing a pay­out, the amount is fixed, based on the first pay­ment. The pay­out for that per­son will not change even though the scheme raises pay­outs over the years.</p>
    <p>Q I’m not yet 30 years old, but am al­ready se­verely dis­abled. Can I join CareShield Life?</p>
    <p>A Yes, you can, but only when you turn 30 years old. You will need to pay the first pre­mium be­fore mak­ing a claim. Should your claim be suc­cess­ful, you will start get­ting the monthly pay­outs and will not need to pay any more pre­mi­ums.</p>
    <p>No Sin­ga­porean or per­ma­nent res­i­dent born on or af­ter 1980 is ex­cluded from this in­surance scheme, which pro­vides for univer­sal cov­er­age.</p>
    <p>Q</p>
    <p>How much pre­mium do I need to pay?</p>
    <p>A Pre­mi­ums, which may be paid with Medis­ave funds, are paid an­nu­ally from the age of 30 years till the age of 67, which means pay­ing pre­mi­ums a to­tal of 38 times.</p>
    <p>Even though the per­son stops pay­ing the pre­mium at the age of 67, he will con­tinue to be cov­ered for the rest of his life.</p>
    <p>How­ever, any pay­out he re­ceives will be pegged to the pre­vail­ing pay­out rate in the year he pays his last pre­mium.</p>
    <p>In the first year, 30-year-olds start at $206 a year for men and $253 for women. Pre­mi­ums are higher for those who are 40 years old, with men pay­ing $295 and women $366.</p>
    <p>Pre­mi­ums go up by 2 per cent a year for the first five years. Sub­se­quent in­creases will be de­cided by the CareShield Life Coun­cil.</p>
    <p>Q</p>
    <p>What if I can­not af­ford the pre­mium for CareShield Life?</p>
    <p>A Peo­ple who do not have enough money in their Medis­ave ac­count may use money from their spouse’s Medis­ave ac­count, or that of an ap­proved fam­ily mem­ber.</p>
    <p>There are also gov­ern­ment sub­si­dies. Lower- to mid­dle-in­come Sin­ga­pore­ans – up to a per capita house­hold in­come of $2,800 – who make up two-thirds of house­holds, will get sub­si­dies of 20 per cent to 30 per cent on their pre­mi­ums.</p>
    <p>There is also a tran­si­tional sub­sidy for the first five years. It starts with $70 in the first year (2020-21) drop­ping by $10 a year to $30 in the fifth year (2024-25).</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore­ans who still can­not af­ford the pre­mi­ums can ap­ply for ad­di­tional sup­port from the Gov­ern­ment.</p>
    <p>Q What if I was born be­fore 1980? Can I join CareShield Life?</p>
    <p>A Yes, you can join, but only from next year. ElderShiel­d pol­i­cy­hold­ers may also con­vert to CareShield Life by pay­ing a top-up amount.</p>
    <p>There will be join­ing in­cen­tives to en­cour­age more peo­ple to buy this in­surance, said the Min­istry of Health. More de­tails will be re­leased be­fore the scheme is ex­tended to all other res­i­dents.</p>
