    <p>NEW DELHI At least 23 peo­ple at­tend­ing a fu­neral in north­ern In­dia were killed when a roof they were shel­ter­ing un­der dur­ing heavy rain­fall col­lapsed yes­ter­day af­ter­noon, a po­lice of­fi­cer said.</p>
    <p>About 20 oth­ers sus­tained in­juries, ac­cord­ing to lo­cal me­dia re­ports.</p>
    <p>About 40 mourn­ers had gath­ered un­der the shel­ter at a cre­ma­to­rium in the town of Mu­rad­na­gar in Ghazi­abad district, Ut­tar Pradesh, near New Delhi, when it col­lapsed, di­vi­sional com­mis­sioner Anita C. Meshram said.</p>
    <p>The mourn­ers were trapped un­der the rub­ble, and res­cue work­ers used snif­fer dogs to look for survivors, who were rushed to nearby hos­pi­tals, some in crit­i­cal con­di­tion.</p>
    <p>Se­nior po­lice of­fi­cer Ijaj Raja later said the res­cue op­er­a­tion has been com­pleted.</p>
    <p>The cause of the col­lapse was not im­me­di­ately clear, but the au­thor­i­ties plan to in­ves­ti­gate the ac­ci­dent.</p>
    <p>“We will con­duct an in­quiry into the mat­ter and find who is re­spon­si­ble – whether it is the builder, of­fi­cials, or work­ers of the mu­nic­i­pal coun­cil, as soon as pos­si­ble,” Ms Meshram said.</p>
    <p>Strict ac­tion would be taken against those who are be­hind the tragedy, lo­cal me­dia In­dia To­day cited Mr V. K. Singh, Union Min­is­ter of State and a Ghazi­abad Mem­ber of Par­lia­ment from the Bharatiya Janata Party, as say­ing from the ac­ci­dent site.</p>
    <p>Whether it is a gov­ern­ment depart­ment or pri­vate, “there will be a fair in­ves­ti­ga­tion”, Mr Singh said.</p>
    <p>Ut­tar Pradesh Chief Min­is­ter Yogi Adityanath has di­rected of­fi­cials to give fi­nan­cial as­sis­tance of 200,000 ru­pees (S$3,600) to the kin of each of the dead vic­tims, the state gov­ern­ment said.</p>
    <p>In­dian Prime Min­ster Naren­dra Modi of­fered his con­do­lences to the rel­a­tives of those killed in the in­ci­dent.</p>
    <p>“The sad news of the un­for­tu­nate ac­ci­dent in Mu­rad­na­gar, Ut­tar Pradesh, has caused great sor­row,” he wrote on Twit­ter yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>“The state gov­ern­ment is en­gaged in re­lief and res­cue work. I ex­press my con­do­lences to the rel­a­tives of those who lost their lives in this ac­ci­dent, as well as wish the in­jured to get well soon.”</p>
    <p>Around 100 peo­ple were at­tend­ing the fu­neral pro­ces­sion of a lo­cal res­i­dent when the roof caved in, the Hin­dus­tan Times re­ported.</p>
    <p>While the build­ing struc­ture at the cre­ma­tion grounds was not con­sid­ered very old, some lo­cal me­dia re­ports have raised con­cerns that the ac­ci­dent could have hap­pened be­cause the build­ing is sit­u­ated in an area where fre­quent wa­ter log­ging oc­curs.</p>
    <p>The soil be­neath the struc­ture could have shifted due to heavy rain, ac­cord­ing to lo­cal daily Live­hin­dus­tan.</p>
    <p>The use of in­fe­rior-qual­ity con­struc­tion ma­te­rial could also have caused the roof to col­lapse, United News of In­dia re­ported.</p>
