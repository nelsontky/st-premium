    <p>An award to cel­e­brate Sin­ga­pore schools that foster in­clu­siv­ity and care for stu­dents from dis­ad­van­taged back­grounds and with greater learn­ing needs will be given out from next year.</p>
    <p>Called the Lee Hsien Loong Award for In­no­va­tions in Up­lift­ing Stu­dents (LHL AIUS), it will re­place the cur­rent Lee Hsien Loong Award for In­no­va­tions in the Nor­mal Course (LHL AIN).</p>
    <p>The awards are funded by a con­tri­bu­tion from Prime Min­is­ter Lee Hsien Loong.</p>
    <p>The LHL AIUS will be worth $3,000 and come with a tro­phy.</p>
    <p>The change was an­nounced by Min­is­ter for Education Lawrence Wong at the an­nual ap­point­ment and ap­pre­ci­a­tion cer­e­mony for prin­ci­pals yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>This fol­lows last year’s an­nounce­ment by then Education Min­is­ter Ong Ye Kung that the Ex­press, Nor­mal (Aca­demic) and Nor­mal (Tech­ni­cal) streams would be grad­u­ally phased out by 2024.</p>
    <p>The new award is open to all pri­mary and se­condary schools rather than just schools with Nor­mal course stu­dents, mak­ing it pos­si­ble for 339 schools to par­tic­i­pate, up from the 111 schools which were el­i­gi­ble for its older it­er­a­tion.</p>
    <p>The LHL AIN was first given out in 2009 to recog­nise schools that had im­ple­mented in­no­va­tive prac­tices and raised the qual­ity of education in the Nor­mal course.</p>
    <p>The new tar­get groups are stu­dents from low-in­come fam­i­lies, at-risk stu­dents and learn­ers re­quir­ing ed­u­ca­tional sup­port.</p>
    <p>Schools that im­prove their ef­forts towards these groups of stu­dents will be con­sid­ered for the award. “Schools would be eval­u­ated based on their ef­fec­tive, sus­tained and in­no­va­tive ef­forts in cater­ing to the needs of the tar­get stu­dents,” said the Min­istry of Education in an in­for­ma­tion sheet about the new award.</p>
    <p>In his speech yes­ter­day, Mr Wong em­pha­sised the important role that schools play in up­lift­ing stu­dents who are usu­ally over­looked. “We want to recog­nise schools’ ef­forts in sup­port­ing the needs of a more di­verse group of stu­dents,” he said.</p>
