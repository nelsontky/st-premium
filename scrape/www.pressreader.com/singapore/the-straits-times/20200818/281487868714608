    <p>Some “red shirt” sup­port­ers turned up at Thai­land’s big­gest anti-govern­ment protest in years over the weekend, but it was clear they were just a sideshow.</p>
    <p>Rap­pers pranced on stage while oth­ers pro­jected trend­ing hash­tags onto the con­crete columns of Bangkok’s Democ­racy Mon­u­ment. Protest lead­ers marched to a po­lice sta­tion af­ter the rally, dar­ing the au­thor­i­ties to ar­rest them.</p>
    <p>This new dis­af­fected gen­er­a­tion is pos­ing a chal­lenge to which Thai­land’s rul­ing es­tab­lish­ment ap­pears to have few ready an­swers.</p>
    <p>It is not a ma­jor threat, said an­a­lysts, given that Prime Min­is­ter Prayut Chan-o-cha and his mil­i­tary-backed coali­tion govern­ment con­trol the levers of power granted by an al­most wa­ter­tight Con­sti­tu­tion. Yet it is a thorny one be­cause pro­test­ers have brushed off in­tim­i­da­tion to con­tinue call­ing for monar­chy re­form, among other de­mands.</p>
    <p>Mr Arnon Nampa, the lawyer who first shook the coun­try on</p>
    <p>Aug 3 when he openly re­quested a re­view of the monar­chy’s role – and was sub­se­quently ar­rested and then re­leased on bail – re­turned on Sun­day night to the erst­while un­touch­able sub­ject.</p>
    <p>To cheers from the crowd of well over 10,000 peo­ple, he re­peated his call for a monar­chy above pol­i­tics and in line with the Con­sti­tu­tion.</p>
    <p>“We ask with sin­cer­ity for the monar­chy to share this dream,” he said in a speech that was live-streamed on Face­book.</p>
    <p>Faced with a lese ma­jeste law that crim­i­nalises each count of defama­tion or in­sult of the monar­chy with up to 15 years in jail, Thais tend to elide the sub­ject from po­lite con­ver­sa­tion.</p>
    <p>Thai­land-based jour­nal­ists self-cen­sor to com­ply with the law. On the streets of in­ner Bangkok on Sun­day, the mostly young pro­test­ers showed little such re­straint. This has raised the ire of roy­al­ists, who have vowed to counter such dis­re­spect ev­ery step of the way. “They just want to wipe (the monar­chy) out,” Mr Su­mat Trakul­wun­noo, leader of Co­or­di­na­tion Cen­tre of Vo­ca­tional Stu­dents for the Pro­tec­tion of</p>
    <p>Na­tional In­sti­tu­tions, told The Straits Times. “We have come so far be­cause the monar­chy has pro­tected our land for us... Why im­port West­ern ideas and cul­ture and aban­don our tra­di­tion and cul­ture? It is just not right.”</p>
    <p>Fears of con­fronta­tion be­tween stu­dent pro­test­ers and roy­al­ists have not been re­alised so far.</p>
    <p>On Sun­day, sev­eral dozen roy­al­ists led by Mr Su­mat, some wear­ing iden­ti­cal masks and shirts sup­port­ing the monar­chy, gath­ered near the Democ­racy Mon­u­ment hours be­fore the stu­dent-led protests got into full swing.</p>
    <p>They later dis­persed peace­fully, but not with­out al­leg­ing through loud­speak­ers that the young pro­test­ers were naive and be­ing ma­nip­u­lated by a third party.</p>
    <p>Ms Sud­ka­ne­ung B., a grad­u­ate stu­dent who also teaches high-school stu­dents, scoffed at the idea, say­ing the younger gen­er­a­tion is more ex­posed to global trends and power dy­nam­ics than some in the older gen­er­a­tion, thanks to so­cial me­dia. She said the protests have in­ad­ver­tently started dif­fi­cult con­ver­sa­tions. “The other day, my aunt sud­denly talked about the monar­chy. She asked me what this gen­er­a­tion was think­ing about,” she told The Straits Times.</p>
    <p>Dr Ti­tipol Phakdee­wanich, the dean of Ubon Ratchathan­i Uni­ver­sity’s po­lit­i­cal science fac­ulty, thinks the chances of a vi­o­lent con­fronta­tion over the monar­chy is­sue are low.</p>
    <p>“Ev­ery­one knows if there is such a con­fronta­tion, it will dam­age the es­tab­lish­ment more than the stu­dents,” he said. Pro­test­ers, while gain­ing trac­tion, will find it dif­fi­cult to mo­bilise mas­sive num­bers onto the streets sim­ply be­cause that needs money, he added.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, to elicit wider sup­port, protest lead­ers who ear­lier or­gan­ised protests un­der the name “Free Youth” are now mo­bil­is­ing un­der the “Free Peo­ple” movement. They shared the stage on Sun­day with ac­tivists call­ing for abor­tion to be de­crim­i­nalised, high-school stu­dents de­mand­ing ed­u­ca­tion re­form, as well as those de­mand­ing justice for lo­cals in the Malay-Mus­lim dom­i­nated south­ern bor­der prov­inces, which are heav­ily mil­i­tarised.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, stu­dents from high schools in Bangkok as well as Songkhla, Ratch­aburi and Udon Thani prov­inces held their arms up in three-fin­ger salutes dur­ing their morn­ing assem­blies as a sign of sup­port for the on­go­ing protests. So­cial me­dia was flooded with videos of har­ried school ad­min­is­tra­tors try­ing to stop the flash mobs.</p>
    <p>Stu­dents who said they are in­creas­ingly un­der sur­veil­lance warned that fur­ther in­tim­i­da­tion will push them onto the streets.</p>
