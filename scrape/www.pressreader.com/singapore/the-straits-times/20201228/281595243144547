    <p>The In­dian gov­ern­ment has for­mally recog­nised yo­gasana as a sport that would be pro­moted widely, with a long-term goal of hav­ing it in­cluded in the Olympic Games. Yo­gasana is de­fined yoga pos­tures that re­quire chore­ographed move­ments. Some of the ground­work to cod­ify the sport has al­ready been done.</p>
    <p>Hav­ing deftly trans­formed the an­cient prac­tice of yoga into a con­tem­po­rary soft power tool, In­dia is now pitch­ing to de­velop yo­gasana – de­fined yoga pos­tures that re­quire chore­ographed move­ments – as a com­pet­i­tive global sport.</p>
    <p>It is a goal that will be nur­tured by na­tional and in­ter­na­tional cham­pi­onships fea­tur­ing medals and broad­cast-friendly pack­ag­ing which, if all goes well, could even gen­er­ate ca­reer op­por­tu­ni­ties for ath­letes and coaches.</p>
    <p>This am­bi­tious plan was re­vealed at a press con­fer­ence on Dec 17 when the In­dian gov­ern­ment said it had for­mally recog­nised yo­gasana as a sport that would be pro­moted widely, with a long-term goal of hav­ing it in­cluded in the Olympic Games.</p>
    <p>De­scrib­ing the Olympic am­bi­tion as “the aim and ob­jec­tive of any sport”, Min­is­ter of State for Youth Af­fairs and Sports Kiren Ri­jiju told the me­dia: “This is the be­gin­ning of a long jour­ney.</p>
    <p>“We will have to make it a very proper, au­then­tic and well-ac­cepted form of a sport.”</p>
    <p>Some of the ground­work to cod­ify the sport has been done, with rules and a syl­labus for yo­gasana pre­pared, asanas (pos­tures) short­listed from tra­di­tional yoga lit­er­a­ture, and an au­to­mated scor­ing sys­tem in the works.</p>
    <p>In Novem­ber last year, the gov­ern­ment set up an In­ter­na­tional Yo­gasana Sports Fed­er­a­tion to spear­head its cam­paign to de­velop a global fol­low­ing.</p>
    <p>To kick off a cal­en­dar of events for next year, the gov­ern­ment will or­gan­ise a Na­tional Individual Yo­gasana Sports Cham­pi­onship in Fe­bru­ary, which will be held vir­tu­ally.</p>
    <p>This will be fol­lowed by con­tests at the state, na­tional and global lev­els.</p>
    <p>Individual, pair and team yo­gasana events have been pro­posed at th­ese events, with a to­tal of 51 medals for win­ners.</p>
    <p>The gov­ern­ment in 2014 had pre­sented the idea of an an­nual In­ter­na­tional Yoga Day at the United Na­tions. This was ap­proved by the UN Gen­eral Assem­bly, and the first such event was held on June 21, 2015. Ef­forts to pro­mote yo­gasana as an in­ter­na­tional com­pet­i­tive sport have also been put in for many years.</p>
    <p>Or­gan­i­sa­tions work­ing to achieve such a goal have wel­comed the gov­ern­ment’s new move as one that will add greater in­sti­tu­tional heft to their cam­paigns.</p>
    <p>Ms Ra­jashree Choud­hury, pres­i­dent of the Lau­sanne-based In­ter­na­tional Yoga Sports Fed­er­a­tion (IYSF), told The Straits Times that it was a big step for­ward.</p>
    <p>The IYSF was set up in 2003 to pro­mote the dis­ci­pline, in­clud­ing get­ting a spot i n the Olympic Games. It has since or­gan­ised a bi­en­nial world cham­pi­onship, with the last edi­tion held in Bei­jing in De­cem­ber 2018.</p>
    <p>“We have a com­mon goal to make yoga big and we need gov­ern­ment help to pro­mote it in­ter­na­tion­ally. I there­fore think the In­dian gov­ern­ment’s ac­knowl­edge­ment of yo­gasana as a com­pet­i­tive sport is a huge thing,” Ms Choud­hury said.</p>
    <p>But the gov­ern­ment’s am­bi­tious plans have also prompted con­cern among some purists who feel they could fur­ther strip yoga of its in­her­ent spir­i­tual com­po­nent and re­duce it to a com­pet­i­tive phys­i­cal sport not un­like gym­nas­tics.</p>
    <p>Dr Ananda Balayogi Bha­vanani, chair­man of the In­ter­na­tional Cen­tre for Yoga Ed­u­ca­tion and Re­search at Ananda Ashram in Pondicherr­y, said he un­der­stands why some hold this view.</p>
    <p>“For me, yoga is life. You are run­ning your race and not any­body else’s race, so there is no com­pe­ti­tion. At the most, it is what you were yes­ter­day com­pared with what you are to­day,” he told ST.</p>
    <p>How­ever, he pointed out that yoga sports, at the same time, have pop­u­larised yoga among chil­dren, many of whom have gone on to fur­ther pur­sue their in­ter­est.</p>
    <p>Gov­ern­ment recog­ni­tion of and sup­port for yo­gasana will now lend this process fur­ther mo­men­tum and also en­able its young prac­ti­tion­ers to use it as a tool for em­pow­er­ment, such as through se­cur­ing ad­mis­sion into higher ed­u­ca­tional in­sti­tu­tions un­der quo­tas re­served for ath­letes.</p>
    <p>“That is why I am play­ing a very tough bal­anc­ing act,” said Dr Bha­vanani, who is one of the vice-pres­i­dents of the Na­tional Yo­gasana Sports Fed­er­a­tion.</p>
    <p>It was set up in Au­gust last year to pro­mote yo­gasana as a com­pet­i­tive sport.</p>
    <p>In 1989, his father, Dr Swami Gi­tananda Giri, a well-known yoga pro­po­nent, ini­ti­ated an an­nual in­ter­na­tional yoga sports cham­pi­onship in Pondicherr­y to at­tract young­sters.</p>
    <p>It in­cor­po­rated oral ques­tions for con­tes­tants on yo­gic phi­los­o­phy to avoid hav­ing the event de­gen­er­ate into a “gym­nas­tics and flex­i­bil­ity con­test”.</p>
    <p>“We tried to keep it very holis­tic,” Dr Bha­vanani said.</p>
    <p>The gov­ern­ment’s ini­tia­tive is, how­ever, fo­cused on yo­gasana as a phys­i­cal ex­er­cise, which, he warned, could lead to cer­tain pit­falls.</p>
    <p>“One is that peo­ple who can­not win in gym­nas­tics will end up be­com­ing yoga stars. It sort of be­comes a poor man’s gym­nas­tics,” he added.</p>
    <p>“So there is a dan­ger again of peo­ple los­ing the big­ger pic­ture of yoga as a way of life, phi­los­o­phy and psy­chol­ogy.”</p>
