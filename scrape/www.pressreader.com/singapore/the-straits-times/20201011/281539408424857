    <p>Re­cently, I dis­cov­ered that I could not see as far as I thought I could.</p>
    <p>I was in the stalls at the Es­planade The­atre last month to see the Sin­ga­pore Dance The­atre take the stage in From Here On, its first live per­for­mance since Covid-19 put the lights out in the­atres around the globe.</p>
    <p>It was by all ac­counts a very good seat – bang in the mid­dle of a row, none of that cran­ing your neck to see over other peo­ple’s heads. There were nearly no other peo­ple. There were only 50 au­di­ence mem­bers in the 1,950-seat the­atre – a full house, un­der the new safe dis­tanc­ing rules for pi­lot per­for­mances.</p>
    <p>The Es­planade was prac­tis­ing “bub­ble-wrap seat­ing”, which sounds like a new­fan­gled tech­nol­ogy but re­ally just means empty seats be­tween you and the next au­di­ence mem­ber in any di­rec­tion. I could not shake the im­age, how­ever, of be­ing bub­ble-wrapped against the per­ils of live the­atre, like a frag­ile ob­ject.</p>
    <p>I had not been in a the­atre since March, which meant this was al­ready the most thrilling bal­let I had ever at­tended.</p>
    <p>But as the dancers took to the stage for their first pas de deux, I grew alarmed. Their out­lines were blurry. I strug­gled to bring their faces into fo­cus. What I re­mem­bered as hav­ing been clear in the past was now in­dis­tinct.</p>
    <p>I have – or had – nearly per­fect eye­sight, and so the no­tion of astig­ma­tism un­set­tles me. Peo­ple say it is in­evitable with age, though I am not yet 30. What was more likely, I thought, was that while stay­ing home through­out the cir­cuit breaker pe­riod and phase one, my abil­ity to see into the dis­tance had fallen out of use.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing the pan­demic, I ex­pe­ri­enced the rest of the world through a screen. There had been no need to fo­cus on any­thing far­ther than the other end of the room.</p>
    <p>Even when I re­turned to the field to re­port on the Gen­eral Elec­tion, I con­tin­ued to be at­tuned mostly to my im­me­di­ate sur­round­ings. If peo­ple were far away, that was all well and good. If they were up close, that was a prob­lem, be­cause it meant a safe dis­tanc­ing am­bas­sador would soon be shout­ing at us.</p>
    <p>There is noth­ing like a pan­demic to nar­row your view of the world. Ev­ery­thing shrinks to the bub­ble you have wrapped your­self in. If it is not im­me­di­ate, it is not im­por­tant; for­get “in the dis­tance”, for­get “down the line”, for­get the fu­ture. 2020 is can­celled. Best to stay still.</p>
    <p>This is a year that has pun­ished am­bi­tion and be­lied fore­sight. There are days when the sheer un­cer­tainty of the fu­ture makes me won­der if there is any point in look­ing ahead now, or if I should just post­pone ma­jor life de­ci­sions in­def­i­nitely. How can you pro­duce a show, plan a wed­ding or plunge into a busi­ness ven­ture when what lies be­fore you is so un­clear that at any step, you may have to call it off?</p>
    <p>Even the tini­est dreams evoke hes­i­ta­tion. Hold­ing a dance party, for in­stance. I dream of danc­ing with aban­don in a crowd. The rush of adren­a­line when your song comes on, the call and re­sponse of bod­ies in mo­tion, the joy of mov­ing to the same beat. Such a thing seems im­pos­si­ble now. One sim­ply can­not see it hap­pen­ing.</p>
    <p>“Will we ever dance to­gether again in pub­lic?” I asked this of Ber­lin-based Sin­ga­porean dance artist Ming Poon, who years ago staged a pub­lic in­ter­ven­tion in which he got strangers on the street to slow-dance with him. Next week, he will be bring­ing the lock­down edi­tion of this work, The In­ter­ven­tion Of Lone­li­ness, to the Es­planade’s da:ns fes­ti­val via Zoom.</p>
    <p>His an­swer was a re­sound­ing yes. “If a lit­tle mask and 1.5m dis­tance is enough to dis­con­nect us, our prac­tice is not deep enough,” he told me – over Zoom, of course, ev­ery­thing nowa­days hap­pens over Zoom. “If I go out on the street now with a card­board sign, I think I could still dance with some­one.”</p>
    <p>I blinked at him in dis­be­lief. He re­garded me serenely. “In my head, it is still pos­si­ble. We are more cre­ative than we think.”</p>
    <p>It was still un­fath­omable to me, but peo­ple were do­ing it. They were open­ing up the­atres and putting on live per­for­mances – al­beit with such tight re­stric­tions on au­di­ence num­bers as to be fi­nan­cially un­ten­able in the long run, but still. They could not see ahead but they were go­ing to start mov­ing any­way.</p>
    <p>In From Here On, the dancer that re­ally caught my eye was soloist Akira Naka­hama as the Sugar Plum</p>
    <p>There is noth­ing like a pan­demic to nar­row your view of the world. Ev­ery­thing shrinks to the bub­ble you have wrapped your­self in. If it is not im­me­di­ate, it is not im­por­tant; for­get “in the dis­tance”, for­get “down the line”, for­get the fu­ture.</p>
    <p>Fairy from The Nut­cracker.</p>
    <p>There was a cau­tious re­serve to her steps, as if she could not quite bring her­self to be­lieve that the ground would still be there on her next land­ing.</p>
    <p>Yet her delight in danc­ing, in be­ing there with us, was so pal­pa­ble it in­fused her ev­ery turn and was vis­i­ble to me across the space be­tween us, even if my fo­cus was un­clear. She danced the way I felt.</p>
    <p>I thought of Naka­hama as I watched my sis­ter pre­pare to re­turn to New York last week, so that she could fin­ish her de­gree.</p>
    <p>This is the coun­try with the high­est num­ber of Covid-19 cases in the world, so to say we were wor­ried would be an un­der­state­ment.</p>
    <p>She was sub­dued as she packed, but de­ter­mined. The virus had dis­rupted her ed­u­ca­tion thus far, but no longer.</p>
    <p>We had had six un­prece­dented months to­gether af­ter we fled the United States in March. It was the most time we had spent with each other since she left to pur­sue her stud­ies.</p>
    <p>In a pan­demic, it is a priv­i­lege to have your loved ones in the same bub­ble as you, to be able to keep them within your sight. I had been af­forded that priv­i­lege. I will not ever for­get that. But my sis­ter has stepped out of the bub­ble and van­ished from my sight.</p>
    <p>In the Shake­speare play Cym­be­line, the princess Imo­gen laments that she could not watch her hus­band sail away: “I would have broke mine eye-strings, crack’d them, but/ To look upon him, till the diminu­tion/ Of space had pointed him sharp as my nee­dle.”</p>
    <p>If only the crack­ing of my eye-strings would keep my sis­ter safe. But we could not have kept her still for­ever.</p>
    <p>We are afraid of things we can­not see and afraid for those out of sight. It is pos­si­ble we will never be able to see clearly, with cer­tainty, again.</p>
    <p>There will come a time for each of us, how­ever, when we can no longer bub­ble-wrap our lives. We will have to leave the bub­ble and risk mov­ing again – un­see­ing, fear­ful, but full of joy.</p>
