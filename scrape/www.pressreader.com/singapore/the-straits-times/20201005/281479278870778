    <p>Smart-en­abled homes with built-in smart power sock­ets and sen­sor-equipped lights in com­mon ar­eas are some new fea­tures res­i­dents in the up­com­ing Pung­gol Northshore district can look for­ward to.</p>
    <p>Own­ers of these smart homes will be able to con­trol just about any ap­pli­ance that is con­nected to a power source – fans, lights and cof­fee ma­chine – through a mo­bile ap­pli­ca­tion.</p>
    <p>Within the es­tate, smart light­ing will rely on sen­sors to au­to­mat­i­cally dim and brighten based on hu­man traf­fic, which saves en­ergy in the long run.</p>
    <p>These fea­tures will also be found in new flats in the up­com­ing “for­est town” of Ten­gah, the first of which are due to be com­pleted in end-2022.</p>
    <p>The Hous­ing Board does mul­ti­ple be­hind-the-scenes tri­als of these new tech­nolo­gies be­fore they are rolled out, as part of its drive to im­prove the HDB liv­ing en­vi­ron­ment.</p>
    <p>The man head­ing these ef­forts, Dr Johnny Wong, told The Straits Times that all new ideas go through strin­gent test­ing at the HDB’s build­ing re­search fa­cil­ity in Wood­lands to en­sure they are tech­ni­cally fea­si­ble, cost-ef­fec­tive and com­ply with cur­rent build­ing reg­u­la­tions.</p>
    <p>Dr Wong, who is group di­rec­tor of the Build­ing and Re­search In­sti­tute, set out how HDB homes have evolved over the years and adopted new tech­nolo­gies, in an in­ter­view last Fri­day to mark the board’s 60th an­niver­sary this year.</p>
    <p>While the HDB’s ear­li­est flats built were sim­ple and util­i­tar­ian, its goal now is to pro­vide smart and sus­tain­able homes that are not just func­tional but also cater to the chang­ing as­pi­ra­tions and con­cerns of the next gen­er­a­tion, he said.</p>
    <p>“There’s a big thing that we need to check. Will res­i­dents ac­cept and like it?” he noted.</p>
    <p>That is where “liv­ing lab­o­ra­to­ries” – ex­ist­ing es­tates with res­i­dents liv­ing in flats – come in.</p>
    <p>Yuhua and Teck Ghee es­tates are two such ex­am­ples.</p>
    <p>In 2012, HDB pi­loted the HDB Green­print pro­gramme in 38 blocks of flats in Yuhua. In 2015, it ex­tended the pro­gramme to some 40 blocks of flats in Teck Ghee.</p>
    <p>Among the sys­tems tri­alled was a pneu­matic waste con­veyance sys­tem, which uses vacuum-type un­der­ground pipes to au­to­mat­i­cally gather house­hold garbage.</p>
    <p>In Yuhua, res­i­dents com­plained of foul-smelling rub­bish chutes not long af­ter the sys­tem was in­stalled, as bulky waste caused chokes.</p>
    <p>Fol­low­ing the feed­back, Dr Wong said the HDB found the root of the prob­lem, cor­rected it and fur­ther re­fined the sys­tem. The im­proved sys­tem is now among the slew of sus­tain­able fea­tures that will be in­cor­po­rated in new flats in es­tates such as Pung­gol Northshore and Ten­gah.</p>
    <p>He sees the HDB’s com­mit­ment to sus­tain­abil­ity as a “so­cial re­spon­si­bil­ity”, as eight in 10 Sin­ga­pore­ans live in an HDB flat to­day.</p>
    <p>“Sin­ga­pore­ans are very ex­posed to what is hap­pen­ing around the world. Sus­tain­abil­ity is not a fash­ion­able word; it’s some­thing that a lot of our young peo­ple are con­cerned about so I think they feel that agen­cies like HDB, in a cer­tain way, must also do their part,” he added.</p>
    <p>He noted that HDB de­vel­op­ments were planned to be sus­tain­able from the be­gin­ning, even be­fore the term “sus­tain­able” was used to describe them.</p>
    <p>For in­stance, HDB flats are de­signed such that cor­ri­dors are nat­u­rally lit dur­ing the day. Homes are de­signed and po­si­tioned to be nat­u­rally breezy and ven­ti­lated, to min­imise the use of air-con­di­tion­ing.</p>
    <p>The in­cor­po­ra­tion of void decks was par­tic­u­larly suc­cess­ful, he said. “Right from the be­gin­ning, the ar­chi­tects got it right be­cause the poros­ity of void decks al­low wind to flow through our build­ings and towns,” he added.</p>
    <p>In a Face­book post yes­ter­day, Prime Min­is­ter Lee Hsien Loong said “many fam­i­lies lived in crowded, squalid con­di­tions” when the board was first es­tab­lished.</p>
    <p>“HDB hit the ground run­ning to build homes for Sin­ga­pore­ans,” he said. “Each new gen­er­a­tion has brought dif­fer­ent needs, life­styles and as­pi­ra­tions, and the HDB has con­tin­ued to in­no­vate and adapt with them. To­day, HDB fo­cuses on build­ing com­mu­nity-cen­tric towns, pay­ing spe­cial at­ten­tion to sus­tain­abil­ity.”</p>
    <p>Dr Wong said the first eco­precinct in Pung­gol, Treelodge@ Pung­gol, was built “very mod­estly” back in 2010, but tech­nol­ogy has since im­proved sig­nif­i­cantly.</p>
    <p>“Frankly when we started, we didn’t ex­pect that smart tech­nol­ogy would come in such a big way as it did and we quickly cap­i­talised on it,” he said.</p>
    <p>“The end re­sult in to­day’s Pung­gol es­tate... turned out more than what I ex­pected. It’s very sat­is­fy­ing but it’s al­ways a work in a progress.”</p>
