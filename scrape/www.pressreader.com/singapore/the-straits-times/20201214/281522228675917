    <p>A com­pre­hen­sive bio­di­ver­sity sur­vey on the South­ern Is­lands has dis­cov­ered sev­eral rare and en­dan­gered species there, in­clud­ing the ori­en­tal mag­pie-robin and spot­ted wood owl.</p>
    <p>The South­ern Is­lands Bio­di­ver­sity Sur­vey looks at the ter­res­trial and ma­rine habi­tats of over 10 is­lands south of main­land Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>Pre­lim­i­nary find­ings show that while some of these is­lands are small and have a his­tory of hu­man ac­tiv­i­ties, they are still able to sup­port rich coastal habi­tats that con­tain rare and en­dan­gered species pre­vi­ously un­known to the area.</p>
    <p>These habi­tats range from coastal forests and man­groves, to in­ter­tidal flats, sub­ti­dal reefs and shal­low seafloor ar­eas.</p>
    <p>The Na­tional Parks Board (NParks) and the Friends of Ma­rine Park com­mu­nity gave this up­date yes­ter­day at the half­way mark of the two-year study, which cov­ers the is­lands that make up Sis­ters’ Is­lands Ma­rine Park, well known is­lands such as Sen­tosa and Pu­lau Se­makau, as well as smaller and lesser-known is­lands such as Pu­lau Bi­ola and Pu­lau Jong. Some of the is­lands, such as Pu­lau Salu and Kep­pel Is­land, have never been sur­veyed be­fore.</p>
    <p>The is­lands in Sis­ters’ Is­lands Ma­rine Park and St John’s Is­land clus­ter, for in­stance, range from about 2.7ha to 75.1ha in size – the equiv­a­lent of about three to 75 foot­ball fields.</p>
    <p>The sur­vey, which in­cor­po­rates data from base­line stud­ies car­ried out by NParks in re­cent years, be­gan in Jan­uary to un­der­stand the dis­tri­bu­tion of plants and an­i­mals and bet­ter guide con­ser­va­tion ef­forts.</p>
    <p>Some of the na­tion­ally en­dan­gered species found there in­clude the ori­en­tal mag­pie-robin, which was newly recorded on Pu­lau Tekukor, and the spot­ted wood owl, which was recorded on the Sis­ters’ Is­lands.</p>
    <p>The na­tion­ally vul­ner­a­ble tex­tile cone snail, which is highly ven­omous, was newly recorded on Lazarus Is­land this year.</p>
    <p>A num­ber of na­tion­ally crit­i­cally en­dan­gered plant species were also newly recorded on var­i­ous is­lands within the St John’s-Sis­ters’ Is­lands clus­ter.</p>
    <p>Some coastal plants are now rare or ex­tinct on the main­land. For ex­am­ple, the lo­cally crit­i­cally en­dan­gered seashore nut­meg was newly recorded on Kusu and Sis­ters’ Is­lands. It can also be found on St John’s and Lazarus Is­lands, as well as Pu­lau Ubin and Pu­lau Tekong.</p>
    <p>Dr Karenne Tun, di­rec­tor of the coastal and ma­rine di­vi­sion at NParks’ Na­tional Bio­di­ver­sity Cen­tre, said stud­ies like the South­ern Is­lands Bio­di­ver­sity Sur­vey go to­wards en­sur­ing fu­ture gen­er­a­tions can con­tinue to en­joy and ap­pre­ci­ate Sin­ga­pore’s rich bio­di­ver­sity.</p>
    <p>Go­ing for­ward, NParks will be de­ploy­ing a re­motely op­er­ated ve­hi­cle for seafloor sur­veys within ar­eas of bio­di­ver­sity in­ter­ests at depths of 20m to 50m.</p>
    <p>It will col­lect data via vis­ual and acous­tic map­ping of the seabed through the use of side-scan and multi-beam sonars, to­gether with photo and video footage. These sur­veys will add on to ex­ist­ing data that was col­lected dur­ing the Com­pre­hen­sive Ma­rine Bio­di­ver­sity Sur­vey in 2010 to 2015.</p>
    <p>In ad­di­tion, new records are be­ing made for sea tur­tles.</p>
    <p>In a pi­lot ear­lier this year, NParks at­tached satel­lite track­ers to the cara­paces of two hawks­bill tur­tles that came ashore. Based on the sig­nals recorded, the tur­tles swam along the east­ern shores of Sin­ga­pore be­fore jour­ney­ing to Riau in In­done­sia, and are cur­rently in their feed­ing grounds off Batam.</p>
    <p>This is the first time such data is be­ing recorded here, en­abling re­searchers to bet­ter un­der­stand the travel pat­terns of nest­ing tur­tles.</p>
    <p>NParks will in­stall more of such track­ers on nest­ing tur­tles dur­ing the next nest­ing sea­son.</p>
    <p>Not­ing that the tur­tles visit Sin­ga­pore more fre­quently than pre­vi­ously thought, Dr Tun said: “That would give us a bet­ter un­der­stand­ing of the tur­tles’ move­ment, and also help us in the con­ser­va­tion of this par­tic­u­lar species.”</p>
