    <p>United States Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump’s visit on Tues­day to Kenosha, the Wis­con­sin city dev­as­tated by ri­ots over the shoot­ing of a black man by po­lice, was an oc­ca­sion to dou­ble down on his law and or­der mes­sage as a key driver of his re-elec­tion cam­paign.</p>
    <p>The visit fo­cused on the riot-hit parts of the city and on law en­force­ment. The Pres­i­dent had the US At­tor­ney-Gen­eral William Barr at his side.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump also pledged sev­eral mil­lion dol­lars to re­vive the city.</p>
    <p>“Loss of busi­ness and loss of prop­erty is stag­ger­ing,” Mr Riki Tagli­api­etra, a lo­cal busi­ness­man help­ing to lead a re­build­ing ef­fort, told him at a meet­ing with lo­cal busi­ness lead­ers and Repub­li­can politi­cians as Democrats stayed away.</p>
    <p>Gov­er­nor Tony Evers, a Demo­crat, had ad­vised Mr Trump not to visit, say­ing it would ex­ac­er­bate ten­sions.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump did not meet the fam­ily of Mr Ja­cob Blake, whose shoot­ing on Aug 23 trig­gered the ini­tial protests against po­lice racism and bru­tal­ity. He also did not men­tion the deadly in­ci­dent on Aug 25, when 17-year-old white teenager Kyle Rit­ten­house – since charged with homi­cide – shot three peo­ple, killing two of them.</p>
    <p>Po­lit­i­cally, the visit made sense.</p>
    <p>Wis­con­sin, with 10 all-im­por­tant Elec­toral Col­lege votes, is a swing state which Mr Trump won in 2016 by fewer than 25,000 votes.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, the pres­i­den­tial race has tight­ened. An Emer­son Col­lege poll con­ducted on Sun­day and Mon­day found that Pres­i­dent Trump has tight­ened the race to a two­point mar­gin and is now trail­ing for­mer vice-pres­i­dent Joe Bi­den by 49 per cent to 47 per cent. In July, Mr Bi­den held a four-point lead – 50 per cent to 46 per cent.</p>
    <p>“It’s all Democrats! Ev­ery­thing’s Demo­crat! All these prob­lems are Demo­crat cities,” Pres­i­dent Trump said, re­fer­ring to the un­rest that has roiled sev­eral cities.</p>
    <p>“Vi­o­lent mobs de­mol­ished or dam­aged at least 25 busi­nesses,</p>
    <p>STAND­ING BE­HIND LAW EN­FORCE­MENT</p>
    <p>burned down pub­lic build­ings, and threw bricks at po­lice of­fi­cers – which your po­lice of­fi­cers won’t stand for, and they didn’t stand for it,” he said at the meet­ing.</p>
    <p>“These are not acts of peace­ful protest, but re­ally do­mes­tic ter­ror.</p>
    <p>“We’re hir­ing more po­lice, surg­ing tough-on-crime fed­eral prose­cu­tors, in­creas­ing penal­ties for as­sault­ing law en­force­ment and for dis­man­tling An­tifa,” he added.</p>
    <p>Mem­bers of An­tifa – the name comes from anti-fas­cism – usu­ally ap­pear at de­mon­stra­tions dressed in black with face cov­er­ings and have of­ten fought with po­lice and at­tacked prop­erty.</p>
    <p>But An­tifa is or­gan­i­sa­tion­ally amor­phous, de­scribed by an­a­lysts as more like a net­work.</p>
    <p>And while Mr Trump has been call­ing for the clas­si­fi­ca­tion of An­tifa as a do­mes­tic ter­ror group, an­a­lysts see that as in­tensely po­lit­i­cal. White mili­tias have also ap­peared at the protests, es­pe­cially lately in Port­land, Ore­gon, and in Kenosha.</p>
    <p>Re­ports have not es­tab­lished that Rit­ten­house, who used a semi­au­to­matic ri­fle, was for­mally a mem­ber of any group. But he was not of age to own such a weapon and he also crossed state lines with it, which is il­le­gal. Po­lice al­lowed him, as well as armed white mili­tia, to be on the streets de­spite cur­few or­ders.</p>
    <p>At a press brief­ing on Mon­day, Pres­i­dent Trump, when asked whether he would con­demn the 17-year-old, seemed to de­fend him, sug­gest­ing he had been act­ing in self-de­fence – which is the ar­gu­ment of the shooter’s lawyer.</p>
    <p>“It seems abun­dantly clear that Don­ald Trump is stak­ing his re-elec­tion on what he calls the is­sue of law and or­der,” Pro­fes­sor of Amer­i­can Stud­ies at Cor­nell Univer­sity Glenn Altschuler told The Straits Times.</p>
    <p>That means “es­sen­tially try­ing to stoke fear among Amer­i­cans at the prospect of loot­ing, ar­son and an­ar­chy in their com­mu­ni­ties; and anger against pro­test­ers for racial jus­tice by equat­ing them with anar­chists, loot­ers, ar­son­ists and so on. That was the theme of the Repub­li­can Na­tional Con­ven­tion… and he is now dou­bling down on that strat­egy”.</p>
    <p>It’s all Democrats! Ev­ery­thing’s Demo­crat! All these prob­lems are Demo­crat cities. Vi­o­lent mobs de­mol­ished or dam­aged at least 25 busi­nesses, burned down pub­lic build­ings, and threw bricks at po­lice of­fi­cers – which your po­lice of­fi­cers won’t stand for, and they didn’t stand for it. These are not acts of peace­ful protest, but re­ally do­mes­tic ter­ror.</p>
