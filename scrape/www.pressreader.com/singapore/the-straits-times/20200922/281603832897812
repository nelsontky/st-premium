    <p>US Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump and his ad­ver­saries have mo­bilised for a show­down over the fu­ture of the Supreme Court, even as the na­tion pre­pared to hon­our the life of Jus­tice Ruth Bader Gins­burg. Mr Trump’s de­ter­mi­na­tion to con­firm a re­place­ment be­fore the Nov 3 elec­tion set law­mak­ers on a col­li­sion course with one an­other in Congress.</p>
    <p>WASHINGTON US Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump said yes­ter­day that he is look­ing at four or five ju­rists to re­place the late Ruth Bader Gins­burg on the US Supreme Court and he will an­nounce his nom­i­nee on Fri­day or Satur­day.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump pushed ahead with plans for his third US Supreme Court nom­i­na­tion, which would ce­ment a 6-3 con­ser­va­tive ma­jor­ity, as some Repub­li­cans wa­vered on whether to sup­port the move weeks be­fore the Nov 3 elec­tion.</p>
    <p>The Repub­li­can Pres­i­dent said in an in­ter­view with Fox News that he wanted to wait out of re­spect for Jus­tice Gins­burg, a champion of women’s rights and a hero to the lib­eral left who died last Fri­day at age 87. “We should wait un­til the ser­vices are over for Jus­tice Gins­burg,” he said.</p>
    <p>The death of the judge, a lib­eral icon, has up­ended the cam­paign sea­son, giv­ing Mr Trump and his party an op­por­tu­nity to strengthen its grip on the court whose de­ci­sions in­flu­ence most spheres of Amer­i­can life, from health­care to gun rights to vot­ing ac­cess.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump said a vote on his Supreme Court nom­i­nee should come be­fore the Nov 3 elec­tion.</p>
    <p>“We won the elec­tion and we have the right to do so, we have plenty of time, a lot of time,” Mr Trump told Fox. “The fi­nal vote should be taken frankly be­fore the elec­tion. We have plenty of time for that.”</p>
    <p>Mr Trump’s de­ter­mi­na­tion to quickly con­firm a re­place­ment for Jus­tice Gins­burg comes at a time when Congress al­ready has ma­jor is­sues on its agenda – in­clud­ing spend­ing Bills to keep the gov­ern­ment open past this week and a stalled coro­n­avirus re­lief pack­age to help mil­lions of Amer­i­cans left un­em­ployed by the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, Jus­tice Gins­burg’s ad­mir­ers con­tin­ued to flock to the Supreme Court build­ing in Washington, where they left trib­utes to the wo­man who late in life came to be called the No­to­ri­ous RBG by her fans.</p>
    <p>The jus­tice may lie in re­pose at the court for two days, with a cer­e­mony there as early as to­day fol­lowed by an outdoor view­ing.</p>
    <p>Jus­tice Gins­burg’s death un­leashed a wave of fundrais­ing by both par­ties, par­tic­u­larly among lib­er­als who poured forth US$100 mil­lion (S$136 mil­lion) through donation-pro­cess­ing site Ac­tBlue by noon on Sun­day. Mr Trump’s cam­paign, mean­while, be­gan sell­ing</p>

    <p>Demo­cratic pres­i­den­tial nom­i­nee Joe Bi­den on Sun­day de­nounced Mr Trump’s de­ci­sion to move ahead with a nom­i­na­tion and ap­pealed to the hand­ful of mod­er­ate Se­nate Repub­li­cans to stop the Pres­i­dent from mak­ing a life­time ap­point­ment – one that would shift the bal­ance of power on the</p>
    <p>US’ high­est court – with­out waiting to see the re­sults of the elec­tion.</p>
    <p>“To jam this nom­i­na­tion through the Se­nate is just an ex­er­cise in raw po­lit­i­cal power,” Mr Bi­den said in a speech in Philadel­phia. He noted that Repub­li­cans re­fused to even con­sider then Pres­i­dent Barack Obama’s nom­i­nee af­ter Jus­tice An­tonin Scalia died in Fe­bru­ary 2016, cit­ing the com­ing elec­tion 10 months later.</p>
    <p>“I don’t be­lieve the peo­ple of this na­tion will stand for it... Trump has al­ready made it clear this is about power, pure and sim­ple.”</p>
    <p>If Mr Trump wins the race, Mr Bi­den said, then the Se­nate should con­sider his choice. “But if I win the elec­tion, Pres­i­dent Trump’s nom­i­na­tion should be with­drawn.”</p>
    <p>Mr Bi­den has pledged to nom­i­nate an African-Amer­i­can wo­man to the Supreme Court.</p>
    <p>A new poll showed that the Amer­i­can pub­lic agrees with him and op­poses Mr Trump’s plan to rush a new jus­tice onto the court.</p>
    <p>Of those sur­veyed by Reuters and Ip­sos since Jus­tice Gins­burg’s death, 62 per cent said her seat should be filled by the win­ner of the Novem­ber elec­tion, in­clud­ing the vast ma­jor­ity of Democrats and even half of Repub­li­cans.</p>
