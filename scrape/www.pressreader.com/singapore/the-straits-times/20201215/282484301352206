    <p>Look­ing for a dif­fer­ent kind of stay­ca­tion? On a “sailcation”, you get to re­lax with the fresh sea breeze and en­joy a con­stant change of scenery.</p>
    <p>Home-grown tour agency EU Hol­i­days of­fers pack­ages to the South­ern Is­lands, which are op­er­ated by sail­ing com­pany Dis­cover Sail­ing Asia.</p>
    <p>So many stay­cays, so lit­tle time. What makes this spe­cial?</p>
    <p>Un­like a reg­u­lar ho­tel, there is no need to spec­ify that you want a room with a sea view.</p>
    <p>For those who want some­thing more pri­vate, this is just the ticket as the Ocea­nis 45 has three cab­ins and, due to the pan­demic, ca­pac­ity is now capped at five guests.</p>
    <p>First im­pres­sions?</p>
    <p>The 13.94m yacht does not seem par­tic­u­larly big but in ad­di­tion to the air-con­di­tioned cab­ins, there is room for a kitchen and din­ing area be­low deck.</p>
    <p>I am im­pressed when I learn that Dis­cover Sail­ing Asia’s orig­i­nal plan was to sail from Phuket to Ok­i­nawa in this ves­sel. Grounded in Singapore en route be­cause of Covid-19, the com­pany de­cided to try some­thing new.</p>
    <p>EU Hol­i­days started of­fer­ing sailcation pack­ages in Oc­to­ber and, due to strong de­mand, it de­cided to char­ter three yachts from last month.</p>
    <p>Rain and light­ning chase us as we depart from One°15 Ma­rina Sen­tosa Cove at around 3pm on a Thurs­day af­ter­noon. Thank­fully, the weather clears up.</p>
    <p>Is there a spa?</p>
    <p>I lie back and let the ebb and flow of the water lull me into a pleas­ant rev­erie. I am on a small stretch of beach on Lazarus Is­land and there is no one else around. Noth­ing like a nat­u­ral spa on a se­cluded beach for a taste of the ex­clu­sive life.</p>
    <p>There is even a gi­ant water bed of sorts. At night, in the cosy cabin, the sea gen­tly rocks me to sleep.</p>
    <p>What else is there to do?</p>
    <p>I do a spot of kayak­ing in a light and in­flat­able craft. Pad­dle board­ing is also an op­tion. Or you can take a dinghy, which trails along be­hind the yacht, to Kusu Is­land for a bit of ex­plor­ing. Just do what­ever floats your boat.</p>
    <p>Af­ter we drop an­chor off Lazarus Is­land in the early evening, I wan­der over to the cres­cent-shaped Lazarus Beach, calm and quiet af­ter the day-trip­pers have gone.</p>
    <p>Why sleep in when you can get an early start to the day?</p>
    <p>Sun­set and sun­rise are some of the best rea­sons to do a sailcation.</p>
    <p>If the weather holds, you can have Lazarus Beach streaked in hues of gold pretty much to your­self be­fore the first pub­lic ferry ar­rives.</p>
    <p>Ver­dict: Bliss or miss?</p>
    <p>If you are look­ing to get away from it all, or if the sea makes you happy, then hop right on board.</p>
    <p>It would be an even sweeter deal if the bento din­ner could be im­proved upon. As it is, the only thing of note is the bub­bly Prosecco wine.</p>
    <p>If you are splurg­ing any­way, you might want to con­sider top­ping up for a four-course meal by a pri­vate chef (an ad­di­tional $388 a per­son); or the Singapore Air­lines Busi­ness Class four-course meal with overnight cruise pack­age ($798 a per­son, two to go).</p>
    <p>Hot tip: Ask to have a turn be­hind the steer­ing wheel and feel like the cap­tain of the ves­sel. Also, even if you do not get sea­sick on the boat, you might feel as if you were bob­bing on water af­ter re­turn­ing to shore at around 10am the fol­low­ing day. Give your­self about a day to re­cover.</p>
    <p>This stay­ca­tion was hosted by EU Hol­i­days and Dis­cover Sail­ing Asia and is part of a weekly se­ries. For more stay­ca­tion re­views, go to str.sg/SuiteLife.</p>
