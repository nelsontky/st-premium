    <p>NEW YORK • US Open ti­tle holder Rafael Nadal be­lieves this year’s cham­pion will still feel like a Grand Slam win­ner de­spite the tour­na­ment los­ing some glam­our ow­ing to the with­drawal of top play­ers amid the Covid-19 pan­demic, the Spa­niard said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>“The tour­na­ment is still big, it’s a Grand Slam,” he told re­porters dur­ing a video con­fer­ence from Spain. “I am not that kind of a per­son, I am not that ar­ro­gant to say that the tour­na­ment is not big enough be­cause I’m not play­ing.”</p>
    <p>On Tues­day, one day af­ter the en­try dead­line, he an­nounced that he was pulling out of the tour­na­ment be­cause of his con­cerns about trav­el­ling dur­ing the coron­avirus pan­demic.</p>
    <p>With 19 Grand Slam sin­gles ti­tles, the world No. 2 is just one short of match­ing Roger Fed­erer’s men’s record, but he has de­cided to wait.</p>
    <p>His next chance could come at the French Open, which he has won a record 12 times and is sched­uled to start on Sept 27 – just two weeks af­ter the US men’s fi­nal.</p>
    <p>“Rafa is one of the great­est cham­pi­ons in the his­tory of our sport, and we sup­port this de­ci­sion,” said Stacey Al­laster, the US Open tour­na­ment di­rec­tor. “How­ever, for the fans and the sport, we look for­ward to be­ing in­spired by him when he de­cides he’s ready to play.”</p>
    <p>Be­cause of tem­po­rary changes to the rank­ing sys­tem, Nadal will still be able to count the points from win­ning last year, even though he is skip­ping this year’s event.</p>
    <p>He said he still in­tends to play at the French Open and re­mains hope­ful it will go ahead. “I trust it will yes, it is in my mind and I am pre­par­ing for it,” the 34-year-old said in the brief­ing with in­ter­na­tional me­dia yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>“But we have to wait for events, to see how ev­ery­thing evolves be­cause it is true that in re­cent weeks the si­t­u­a­tion seems to have wors­ened a lit­tle.”</p>
    <p>He will not be the only player watch­ing the US Open from afar. So will fourth-ranked Fed­erer, who has an­nounced he will not play again this year due to knee surgery.</p>
    <p>The vast ma­jor­ity of lead­ing play­ers are, at least for now, still en­tered, in­clud­ing Serena Wil­liams, Naomi Osaka, Karolina Pliskova, Sofia Kenin, Bianca An­dreescu, the reign­ing women’s cham­pion, and world No. 1 No­vak Djokovic. But the top-ranked woman Ash­leigh Barty has with­drawn.</p>
    <p>The United States Ten­nis As­so­ci­a­tion laid out key el­e­ments of its safety plan in an up­date sent to play­ers, ex­plain­ing that if a player leaves the tour­na­ment bub­ble with­out writ­ten per­mis­sion, then the player will be re­moved and fined an un­spec­i­fied amount.</p>
    <p>If a coach or other mem­ber of a player’s en­tourage leaves the bub­ble, their cre­den­tial will be re­voked, and the said per­son will be re­quired to leave the tour­na­ment ho­tel within 24 hours.</p>
    <p>He or she would also be fined and pro­hib­ited from re­ceiv­ing a cre­den­tial to next year’s US Open.</p>
