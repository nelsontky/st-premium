    <p>Get ready for a new season of scares: Warn­erMe­dia this week an­nounced the sec­ond season of the HBO Asia Orig­i­nal hor­ror an­thol­ogy series, Folk­lore.</p>
    <p>Vet­eran Sin­ga­porean film­maker Eric Khoo will once again helm the award-win­ning hor­ror series, which will con­sist of seven episodes, each an hour long.</p>
    <p>The episodes will be di­rected by a mix of es­tab­lished and up-and­com­ing lo­cal di­rec­tors from seven Asian mar­kets: In­done­sia, Ja­pan, Malaysia, the Philip­pines, Sin­ga­pore, Tai­wan and Thai­land.</p>
    <p>Ms Mag­da­lene Ew, head of en­ter­tain­ment of Warn­erMe­dia In­dia, South-east Asia and Korea, said: “The hor­ror genre has al­ways worked well in Asia. Fol­low­ing the suc­cess of the first season of Folk­lore, Warn­erMe­dia has green­lit the sec­ond season of the award­win­ning series, ex­pand­ing the an­thol­ogy series to more Asian coun­tries.”</p>
    <p>The di­rec­tors for Folk­lore’s sec­ond season will in­clude Sit­tisiri Mongkol­siri from Thai­land, Liao Shih-Han from Tai­wan, Erik Matti from the Philip­pines, Billy Chris­tian from In­done­sia, Ni­cole Mi­dori Wood­ford from Sin­ga­pore, Bradley Liew from Malaysia and Ja­panese singer-song­writer Seiko Mat­suda, who will be mak­ing her di­rec­to­rial de­but.</p>
    <p>The first season (2018 to 2019) ex­plored deep-seated Asian su­per­sti­tions such as the pon­tianak (a fe­male vam­pire) and the toyol (a child spirit).</p>
    <p>Episodes of the six-part an­thol­ogy went to many hor­ror fes­ti­vals, in­clud­ing the Sit­ges Film Fes­ti­val in Spain and Fan­tas­tic Fest in the United States.</p>
    <p>Showrun­ner Khoo says the sec­ond season will con­tinue to ex­plore spir­its and ghouls from Asian folk­lore.</p>
    <p>“There was a l ot of so­cial commentary in the first season. In season two, we want to push for a more sus­pense­ful para­nor­mal nar­ra­tive. It will be spook­ier.”</p>
    <p>He adds: “It was won­der­ful work­ing with such tal­ented di­rec­tors for Folk­lore and I can’t wait to jour­ney with this new, ex­cit­ing team for season two.</p>
    <p>“I’m also ex­tremely happy that we have two fe­male di­rec­tors on board.”</p>
    <p>One of them is 1980s Ja­panese pop icon Seiko Mat­suda, 58, who starred in Khoo’s food and fam­ily drama Ra­men Teh (2018).</p>
    <p>With­out giv­ing too much away, she says her episode is based on her per­sonal ex­pe­ri­ence.</p>
    <p>She told Khoo about it and the di­rec­tor told her she had to re­alise it on screen – and that he would help her do it.</p>
    <p>It took the pop star a year to write and flesh out the story with Ms Tan Fong Cheng, a pro­ducer with Khoo’s Zhaowei Films.</p>
    <p>“The idea of the story has been in my mind for a long time, so the story it­self was very easy to write. Fong Cheng is re­ally tal­ented and I learnt a lot from her in the process of writ­ing the script.</p>
    <p>“This is my di­rec­to­rial de­but, and I am very grate­ful and ex­cited to have such a won­der­ful op­por­tu­nity.”</p>
    <p>The other fe­male di­rec­tor is Wood­ford, 34, who says her episode will be cen­tred on a mother’s un­set­tling and haunt­ing re­la­tion­ship with her child.</p>
    <p>“It will be a lo­cal story that will be fa­mil­iar to a lot of Sin­ga­pore­ans while still be­ing quite con­tem­po­rary,” says the film-maker, who also lec­tures at the School of Art, De­sign and Me­dia i n Nanyang Tech­no­log­i­cal Univer­sity.</p>
    <p>“I think the mother char­ac­ter in my script is very com­plex. As a woman my­self, this com­plex­ity is some­thing I def­i­nitely spent a lot of time craft­ing in my script.”</p>
    <p>Filipino di­rec­tor Matti, 49, says he is grate­ful to be on board the new season.</p>
    <p>He says: “We have a rich her­itage of folk­lore and myths that can be traced to pa­gan Philip­pines. Th­ese also have a mix of Span­ish be­liefs, as the Span­ish oc­cu­pied the Philip­pines for over 300 years.”</p>
    <p>Prin­ci­pal pho­tog­ra­phy will com­mence early next year across Asia.</p>
