    <p>While the var­i­ous gov­ern­ment agen­cies have set their safe lim­its and rules when it comes to al­low­ing more staff to re­turn to the work­place, the mind­set of em­ploy­ers and se­nior man­age­ment re­mains stuck in the mud (Com­pa­nies plan to ease staff back into the of­fice, Sept 25).</p>
    <p>From what I un­der­stand, be­ing autho­rised to work in the of­fice does not mean that the em­ployee has to work in the of­fice. It merely means that, should there be a need, this em­ployee whose name has been sub­mit­ted – to the Mon­e­tary Au­thor­ity of Sin­ga­pore (MAS), for ex­am­ple – is cleared to re­turn to the of­fice for work.</p>
    <p>How­ever, should he or she have no press­ing need to work from the of­fice, the de­fault should still be to work from home.</p>
    <p>If in­deed an autho­rised em­ployee should still main­tain work­ing from home as the de­fault op­tion, then the au­thor­i­ties need to stress this point to all em­ploy­ers.</p>
    <p>Tech­ni­cally, if a bank sub­mits 100 names to MAS for clear­ance to go back to the work­place, the bank could still have zero staff in the of­fice, with all 100 work­ing from home.</p>
    <p>The sub­mis­sion of the 100 names merely means that these 100 em­ploy­ees can choose to go back to the of­fice. It is not an obli­ga­tion to do so.</p>
    <p>The man­age­ment should not force em­ploy­ees – even if they are autho­rised – to go back to the of­fice if their jobs can be done re­motely.</p>
    <p>If the Gov­ern­ment wants to en­cour­age work­ing from home as the de­fault op­tion, the mes­sage should be made clear to em­ploy­ers and those in the man­age­ment ranks of firms.</p>
