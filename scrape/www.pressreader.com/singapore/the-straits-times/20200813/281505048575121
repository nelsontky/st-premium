    <p>For the first time in 14 years, 472 new units are up for sale in Bis­han, a ma­ture Hous­ing Board es­tate.</p>
    <p>The two-room flexi, three-room and four-room flats in Bis­han Tow­ers, which is bounded by Bis­han Street 11 and Brad­dell Road, will have a view of the Kal­lang River.</p>
    <p>Prices start from $176,000 for a two-room flexi flat, ex­clud­ing grants, and $484,000 for a four­room flat.</p>
    <p>The new Build-To-Or­der flats were l aunched by the Hous­ing Board yes­ter­day as part of a com­bined sales ex­er­cise for 7,862 new BTO flats across eight es­tates.</p>
    <p>The other flats are spread across the ma­ture towns of Ang Mo Kio, Gey­lang, Pasir Ris and Tampines, and non-ma­ture towns of Choa Chu Kang, Ten­gah and Wood­lands.</p>
    <p>In all, 11 hous­ing projects were launched for sale, in­clud­ing flats orig­i­nally slated for launch in May but had to be post­poned due to the ex­ten­sion of the cir­cuit breaker.</p>
    <p>The big­gest BTO project in this launch is in Wood­lands, with 1,785 two-room flexi, three-room, four­room and five-room flats on of­fer.</p>
    <p>The project, Ur­banVille @ Wood­lands, sits in a prime lo­ca­tion, just five min­utes’ walk­ing dis­tance from Wood­lands MRT sta­tion.</p>
    <p>The HDB said a num­ber of projects in the mega sales ex­er­cise may take up to five years to com­plete due to safety mea­sures in­tro­duced at con­struc­tion sites to curb Covid-19.</p>
    <p>Those keen on Ur­banVille flats will have to wait the long­est, around 62 months, while those who are try­ing for the Bis­han flats should ex­pect to wait be­tween 52 and 54 months, with the flats to be ready by the third quar­ter of 2025.</p>
    <p>House hunters who could not ap­ply for a Build-To-Or­der (BTO) flat in May now have plenty of op­tions as 7,862 new flats in eight es­tates were launched for sale by the Hous­ing Board yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>For the first time in 14 years, 472 new units are up for sale in the ma­ture es­tate of Bis­han. The tworoom flexi, three-room and four­room flats in Bis­han Tow­ers will have a wa­ter­front view of the Kal­lang River. Bis­han Tow­ers is bounded by Bis­han Street 11 and</p>
    <p>Brad­dell Road.</p>
    <p>Prices start from $176,000 for a two-room flexi flat, ex­clud­ing grants, and $484,000 for a four­room flat.</p>
    <p>The last time new flats were up for sale in Bis­han was in 2006, when 176 stu­dio apart­ments for the el­derly were launched.</p>
    <p>Be­sides Bis­han, the other flats are spread across the ma­ture towns of Ang Mo Kio, Gey­lang, Pasir Ris and Tampines, and the non-ma­ture towns of Choa Chu Kang, Ten­gah and Wood­lands.</p>
