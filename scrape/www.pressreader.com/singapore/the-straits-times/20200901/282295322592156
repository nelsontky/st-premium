    <p>We have an enor­mous buf­fer of for­eign work­ers here who have con­trib­uted im­mensely to the econ­omy while it was boom­ing.</p>
    <p>But now that omi­nous times are loom­ing and un­em­ploy­ment rates ris­ing, pri­or­ity for jobs should right­fully go to lo­cals (Job rules tight­ened so S’pore­ans have more ac­cess to va­can­cies, Aug 28 ).</p>
    <p>In­creas­ing the min­i­mum qual­i­fy­ing salary for Em­ploy­ment Pass (EP) or S Pass hold­ers may en­sure that only the most cost-ef­fec­tive and ef­fi­cient for­eign work­ers with the best qual­i­fi­ca­tions get the jobs, but ig­nores the com­mon mal­prac­tice of em­ploy­ers who de­clare a high pay for pass-hold­ers, then get dis­burse­ment back from them.</p>
    <p>Am­ply qual­i­fied lo­cals who should have got the job lose out to the for­eigner sim­ply be­cause of the salary dif­fer­en­tial and not on ap­ti­tude or at­ti­tude.</p>
    <p>Very few cases in­volv­ing such cir­cum­ven­tion of the law are suc­cess­fully pros­e­cuted in court. It re­flects how dif­fi­cult it is to prove such guilt in the courts.</p>
    <p>The au­thor­i­ties are de­pen­dent only on com­plaints made by the pub­lic and proof of non-com­pli­ance with the law is mainly de­pen­dent on pass-hold­ers tes­ti­fy­ing for the prose­cu­tion against em­ploy­ers.</p>
    <p>But why would they want to do that when their jobs are at stake and they are also pun­ish­able for be­ing com­plicit in the il­le­gal act?</p>
    <p>If pass-hold­ers tes­ti­fy­ing against em­ploy­ers are spared pun­ish­ment, far more such cases would come to the fore.</p>
    <p>If pass-hold­ers are also com­pelled to make Cen­tral Prov­i­dent Fund (CPF) con­tri­bu­tions, lo­cal jobs would be less at­trac­tive to them and there would also be less in­cen­tive for bosses to pre­fer them over lo­cal em­ploy­ees.</p>
