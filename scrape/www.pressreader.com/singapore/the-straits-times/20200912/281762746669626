    <p>Those who wish to col­lect their two free re­us­able masks may do so from vend­ing ma­chines from Sept 21 till Oct 4, said Te­masek Foun­da­tion yes­ter­day in an up­date on its lat­est mask col­lec­tion ex­er­cise.</p>
    <p>Te­masek Foun­da­tion, the so­cial and char­ity arm of Sin­ga­pore in­vest­ment com­pany Te­masek, added that res­i­dents may col­lect masks on be­half of their fam­ily mem­bers and friends by bring­ing and scan­ning the bar­codes of their re­spec­tive gov­ern­men­tis­sued IDs.</p>
    <p>From 8am on Sun­day, mem­bers of the pub­lic can go to staypre­pared.sg/buy­masks to check on lo­ca­tions of the vend­ing ma­chines for each of the dif­fer­ent mask types, as well as stock avail­abil­ity.</p>
    <p>The lat­est na­tion­wide mask dis­tri­bu­tion ex­er­cise was an­nounced by Te­masek chief ex­ec­u­tive and ex­ec­u­tive direc­tor Ho Ching on Wed­nes­day night. Ms Ho had also said that masks could be pre-or­dered on­line for a fee.</p>
    <p>Giv­ing more de­tails yes­ter­day, the foun­da­tion said that pre-or­ders can be made from Sun­day till Oct 2 at the web­site or via the DBS PayLah app.</p>
    <p>The foun­da­tion high­lighted that pre-or­ders are sub­ject to stock avail­abil­ity, and that there will be no di­rect sales or pay­ment at the vend­ing ma­chines. The fee may be paid on­line us­ing PayNow, credit cards or via the DBS PayLah app.</p>
    <p>A unique QR code will be gen­er­ated for each suc­cess­ful trans­ac­tion, which will then be sent to the mo­bile num­ber used for the or­der. Res­i­dents may then scan their unique pre-or­der QR code at the vend­ing ma­chines to re­deem and col­lect their mask kits.</p>
    <p>If the ini­tial vend­ing ma­chine runs out of stock, or if they or­der dif­fer­ent colours re­quir­ing col­lec­tion at dif­fer­ent ma­chines, they can re­deem the bal­ance of their or­der from another ma­chine.</p>
    <p>Te­masek Foun­da­tion said it was em­bark­ing on this sec­ond round of dis­tri­bu­tion due to the pop­u­lar­ity of the re­us­able masks it dis­trib­uted in June and July.</p>
    <p>“Re­us­able masks are a use­ful and sus­tain­able al­ter­na­tive to sin­gle-use dis­pos­able masks, which are highly pol­lu­tive for our en­vi­ron­ment if not dis­posed of cor­rectly,” it said, adding that since the out­break, nearly 100 mil­lion dis­pos­able masks have been used each month glob­ally.</p>
    <p>The foun­da­tion added: “This is well over a bil­lion an­nu­ally. The en­vi­ron­men­tal im­pact from the use and dis­posal of these masks can be greatly re­duced if we can make the switch to re­us­able masks.”</p>
    <p>Te­masek chair­man Lim Boon Heng said: “To­gether with our part­ners, we will con­tinue to find more ways to help our com­mu­ni­ties stay safe, in­clud­ing us­ing the vend­ing ma­chine net­work to dis­trib­ute use­ful items such as med­i­cal sup­plies, vi­ta­mins or food, in fu­ture.”</p>
