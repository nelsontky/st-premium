    <p>We fo­cus on key val­ues con­ducive to growth: Are peo­ple of a given nation, on av­er­age, hard-work­ing, thrifty, trust­ing, or risk averse? The harder peo­ple work, the higher the growth po­ten­tial. The will­ing­ness and abil­ity to save de­ter­mines, to a large ex­tent, whether a coun­try will grow through in­vest­ments and ex­ports ver­sus con­sump­tion.</p>
    <p>Trust goes a long way to­wards ex­plain­ing wealth and in­come in­equal­i­ties and the role that gov­ern­ments can play in min­imis­ing these in­equal­i­ties. Economies with highly risk-averse cit­i­zens will stall.</p>
    <p>We also iden­tify poli­cies that, in our view, have the great­est im­pact on economies. Mar­ket forces are es­sen­tial for fur­ther growth. Po­lit­i­cal sta­bil­ity, in par­tic­u­lar the ab­sence of armed con­flicts, is more con­ducive to growth than any spe­cific form of gov­ern­ment.</p>
    <p>An ed­u­cated work­force breeds in­no­va­tion and pro­duc­tiv­ity. Cor­rup­tion, on the other hand, can se­ri­ously de­rail an econ­omy. Sound fis­cal and mon­e­tary poli­cies are vi­tal for an econ­omy to go through its cy­cles and pre­vent crises. This book bridges the gap be­tween val­ues and poli­cies, recog­nis­ing that it is only by tak­ing into con­sid­er­a­tion these two sets of fac­tors that we can truly un­der­stand how economies work.</p>
    <p>WHY VAL­UES MAT­TER</p>
    <p>The way peo­ple around the world think and be­have is guided by a com­plex sys­tem of val­ues, at­ti­tudes, and be­liefs, of­ten loosely de­fined as “cul­ture”. Given the wide range of in­ter­pre­ta­tions of what cul­ture en­tails and the some­times over­lap­ping def­i­ni­tions of val­ues, at­ti­tudes, and be­liefs, in this book we re­fer mainly to val­ues, de­fined as prin­ci­ples that we closely iden­tify with and which drive us through­out our lives.</p>
    <p>We may not re­alise it, but val­ues are deeply rooted into each of us. As a re­sult, they sel­dom change over time, and even when they do change, they do so very slowly. Most of us feel that we be­long to a group, whether it is a nation, a com­mu­nity, a fam­ily, a so­cial class, an eth­nic­ity, a town, or a re­li­gion. Peo­ple share many of the same val­ues within the group they be­long to and tend to trans­mit those val­ues from one gen­er­a­tion to the next.</p>
    <p>The abil­ity of so­ci­eties to gen­er­ate wealth over a sus­tained pe­riod of time ul­ti­mately de­ter­mines their destiny. Only wealthy so­ci­eties can af­ford a large-scale mod­ern mil­i­tary es­tab­lish­ment, en­sure the well-be­ing of their cit­i­zens, and grow their sphere of in­flu­ence. Like­wise, eco­nomic mis­man­age­ment can pre­cip­i­tate their down­fall.</p>
    <p>The be­lief that the same eco­nomic the­o­ries ap­ply to every so­ci­ety is mis­lead­ing. The same eco­nomic poli­cies en­acted in Congo, China, or Chile will of­ten yield very dif­fer­ent re­sults.</p>
    <p>Sig­nif­i­cantly re­duc­ing taxes in Nordic coun­tries would only re­sult in higher in­equal­i­ties with­out spurring growth. But rais­ing taxes in Latin Amer­i­can coun­tries to lev­els com­monly ob­served in Nordic coun­tries would gen­er­ate even more tax eva­sion and cor­rup­tion with­out re­duc­ing in­equal­i­ties.</p>
    <p>Pro­mot­ing higher in­vest­ments in coun­tries that save lit­tle of their in­come will be largely in­ef­fec­tive and pos­si­bly coun­ter­pro­duc­tive.</p>
    <p>Gov­ern­ment in­cen­tives for peo­ple to start their own ven­ture may lead to a more en­tre­pre­neur­ial work­force, but in Ja­pan such ef­forts have failed and will con­tinue to fail.</p>
    <p>While glob­al­i­sa­tion has re­duced dif­fer­ences in val­ues among peo­ple around the world, it has not done so to the point where those dif­fer­ences no longer mat­ter. Any­one who has trav­elled ex­ten­sively to dif­fer­ent coun­tries and con­ti­nents knows that val­ues re­main deeply en­trenched in each of us and con­tinue to greatly in­flu­ence the way peo­ple make their de­ci­sions.</p>
    <p>TRUST</p>
    <p>Stud­ies find a strong link be­tween so­cial trust and eco­nomic growth. Coun­tries in which peo­ple trust each other, and are there­fore able to trans­act more ef­fi­ciently, are on av­er­age more likely to reach higher lev­els of devel­op­ment. This is also true within coun­tries: In the United States, states with higher so­cial trust are more pros­per­ous than states where peo­ple have less trust for each other.</p>
    <p>We should not con­clude from these ob­ser­va­tions that economies where peo­ple do not trust each other can never grow. Brazil­ians have lit­tle trust for oth­ers and yet have seen their econ­omy grow strongly in the sec­ond half of the 20th cen­tury, and again dur­ing the first decade of the 21st cen­tury. But a lack of so­cial trust makes it more dif­fi­cult to at­tain higher eco­nomic growth given the ad­di­tional costs in­curred.</p>
    <p>Another com­mon fea­ture of so­ci­eties where peo­ple gen­er­ally trust oth­ers is that they tend to be more equal. Nordic coun­tries, where so­cial trust is the high­est in the world, also have the low­est lev­els of in­come in­equal­ity. Latin Amer­i­can coun­tries, where peo­ple are the most dis­trust­ful of oth­ers, are among the most un­equal.</p>
    <p>Al­though so­cial trust has re­mained sta­ble in most coun­tries, it has de­clined in the US and the United King­dom...</p>
    <p>COVID-19</p>
    <p>Covid-19 has chal­lenged our nat­u­ral ten­dency to re­sist change. As eco­nomic ac­tiv­ity re­turns, some changes are likely to be­come per­ma­nent.</p>
    <p>Some­one work­ing at home on the out­skirts of Lon­don or New York could just as well be work­ing from Ban­ga­lore, Dalian, or War­saw. Equip­ping work­ers with valu­able and up­graded skills to nav­i­gate a glob­alised and chang­ing world is be­com­ing ever more crit­i­cal.</p>
    <p>The pan­demic has also pro­vided another re­minder that the same poli­cies can yield very dif­fer­ent re­sults in dif­fer­ent places. We dis­cuss in this book how coun­tries with high lev­els of so­cial trust have had much greater suc­cess in fight­ing the virus be­cause peo­ple who gen­er­ally trust each other are more likely to be­have in a way that con­sid­ers the in­ter­ests of oth­ers and to fol­low the rec­om­men­da­tions of their au­thor­i­ties.</p>
