    <p>HONG KONG • China has ac­cused Hong Kong democ­racy ac­tivists of try­ing to start a revo­lu­tion as it warned that some of those cam­paign­ing for re­cent pri­maries may have breached a tough new se­cu­rity law it im­posed on the city.</p>
    <p>The bel­li­cose com­ments by the Li­ai­son Of­fice, which rep­re­sents China’s gov­ern­ment in the semi­au­tonomous city, heighten the risk of pros­e­cu­tion for op­po­si­tion par­ties and lead­ing fig­ures.</p>
    <p>More than 600,000 Hong Kongers turned out over the week­end to choose can­di­dates for up­com­ing leg­isla­tive polls de­spite warn­ings from gov­ern­ment of­fi­cials that the ex­er­cise could breach Bei­jing’s sweep­ing new law. Polls for the city’s par­tially elected leg­is­la­ture are to take place in Septem­ber.</p>
    <p>Pro-democ­racy par­ties are keen to use seething pub­lic anger to­wards Bei­jing’s in­creas­ingly au­thor­i­tar­ian rule to win a ma­jor­ity in a cham­ber that has al­ways been weighted in favour of pro-es­tab­lish­ment par­ties. Con­trol could give them a greater abil­ity to stall bud­gets and leg­is­la­tion, one of the few tac­tics left open to the op­po­si­tion camp.</p>
    <p>But in a state­ment late on Mon­day, the Li­ai­son Of­fice de­scribed the pri­maries as “a se­ri­ous provo­ca­tion against the cur­rent elec­tion sys­tem”.</p>
    <p>It said cam­paign­ing that pushed to take con­trol of and paral­yse the cham­ber is a breach of Ar­ti­cle 22 of the se­cu­rity law. Ar­ti­cle 22 tar­gets “sub­vert­ing state power”. It out­laws “se­ri­ous in­ter­fer­ence and ob­struc­tion” of the cen­tral and Hong Kong gov­ern­ments, or any act that causes them to be “un­able to per­form their func­tions nor­mally”.</p>
    <p>The state­ment also sin­gled out democ­racy ac­tivist Benny Tai, who played a lead­ing role in or­gan­is­ing the pri­maries. “The goal of the Benny Tai gang and the op­po­si­tion camp is to seize power to gov­ern Hong Kong, with a vain at­tempt to launch a Hong Kong ver­sion of a ‘colour revo­lu­tion’,” it said.</p>
    <p>“Colour revo­lu­tion” de­scribes mul­ti­ple pop­u­lar protest move­ments around the world that swept a gov­ern­ment from power or tried to. But in com­mu­nist China – it­self a state built from revo­lu­tion – the term has fre­quently been used by both the gov­ern­ment and state me­dia to de­scribe an il­le­git­i­mate revo­lu­tion backed by hid­den, usu­ally Western, forces.</p>
    <p>Pro­fes­sor Tai, a law don, was pre­vi­ously jailed for his in­volve­ment i n peace­ful pro-democ­racy protests in 2014.</p>
    <p>The Ap­ple Daily news­pa­per yes­ter­day ran a col­umn by him in which he hailed the pri­maries. “Threats from the pow­er­ful did not de­ter tens of thou­sands of cit­i­zens from com­ing out and cast­ing a bal­lot,” he wrote. “They have not given up on their de­ter­mi­na­tion to pur­sue democ­racy and universal suf­frage.”</p>
    <p>Ap­ple Daily is owned by Mr Jimmy Lai, one of the few ty­coons in Hong Kong to openly sup­port democ­racy. He is also be­ing pros­e­cuted for tak­ing part in pro-democ­racy protests.</p>
    <p>Hong Kong has seen waves of pro-democ­racy demon­stra­tions over the last decade. But last year, the city was con­vulsed by seven straight months of huge and of­ten vi­o­lent protests.</p>
    <p>In re­sponse, Bei­jing im­posed its se­cu­rity law in a bid to end the un­rest once and for all. The leg­is­la­tion by­passed Hong Kong’s leg­is­la­ture and its con­tents were kept se­cret un­til the law was en­acted at the end of last month.</p>
