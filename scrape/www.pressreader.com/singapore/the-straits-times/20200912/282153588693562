    <p>The coronaviru­s pandemic may have dis­rupted reli­gious ser­vices and ac­tiv­i­ties around the world, but lead­ers of var­i­ous faiths have stepped up to help their com­mu­ni­ties and oth­ers cope with the cri­sis.</p>
    <p>A group of reli­gious lead­ers, aca­demics and so­cial ad­vo­cates from var­i­ous faiths and coun­tries came to­gether for an in­ter­na­tional we­bi­nar yes­ter­day to share ex­pe­ri­ences and dis­cuss the role they can play as the world con­tin­ues to grap­ple with the chal­lenges posed by Covid-19.</p>
    <p>The event was hosted by Mus­lim vol­un­tary wel­fare or­gan­i­sa­tion Jamiyah Sin­ga­pore and was opened by Pres­i­dent Hal­imah Ya­cob, who said: “In this time of un­cer­tainty, it is nat­u­ral for many to turn to their faiths for source of strength and so­lace. This evening’s we­bi­nar is an op­por­tune plat­form for in­ter-faith lead­ers to share in­sights on how we can all play an im­por­tant role in pro­mot­ing sol­i­dar­ity and mu­tual un­der­stand­ing be­tween peo­ple of dif­fer­ent races and re­li­gions.”</p>
    <p>Not­ing that the pandemic was far from over, Pres­i­dent Hal­imah said an ef­fec­tive re­sponse would also re­quire ev­ery­one in the com­mu­nity to do their part. “We will also need to help our peo­ple man­age the so­cial, psy­cho­log­i­cal, emo­tive and spir­i­tual im­pact of the cri­sis.”</p>
    <p>She added that she was heart­ened that many faith lead­ers had con­tin­ued their work of strength­en­ing trust be­tween dif­fer­ent com­mu­ni­ties and ral­ly­ing their faith com­mu­ni­ties to stay united and re­silient dur­ing this chal­leng­ing time.</p>
    <p>“Many have also reached out to help those af­fected by the pandemic, re­gard­less of race, lan­guage or re­li­gion. I ap­plaud these in­ter­faith ef­forts,” she said.</p>
    <p>The event also saw par­tic­i­pants speak about ef­forts that could be ini­ti­ated to strengthen un­der­stand­ing be­tween peo­ple of var­i­ous faiths.</p>
    <p>Car­di­nal Miguel An­gel Ayuso Guixot, pres­i­dent of the Pon­tif­i­cal Coun­cil for In­ter-reli­gious Di­a­logue at the Vat­i­can, said: “The pandemic has ag­gra­vated deep in­equal­i­ties that ex­ist in our so­ci­eties. There is a need for care and in­spired ac­tion to ad­dress these.”</p>
    <p>He noted how fol­low­ers of all faiths had been af­fected, say­ing: “Our col­lab­o­ra­tion can also ex­pand to the ed­u­ca­tion of val­ues that will pre­serve a post-Covid-19 world from a cul­ture of in­dif­fer­ence, selfish­ness and other so­cial ills made visible by the pandemic.”</p>
    <p>Ven­er­a­ble Phramaha Hansa Dhamma­haso, an as­so­ciate pro­fes­sor at Thai­land’s Ma­hachu­la­longko­rn­ra­javidyalay­a Univer­sity, spoke about the ma­te­rial and emo­tional help pro­vided by monas­ter­ies in his coun­try dur­ing the pandemic and urged peo­ple to main­tain safe dis­tanc­ing and pro­tect them­selves in or­der to pro­tect the com­mu­nity.</p>
    <p>He said: “Please take the best care of your­self in or­der to take the best care of oth­ers.”</p>
