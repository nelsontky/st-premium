    <p>When a new bus hits the roads, lab­o­ra­tory tech­ni­cian Chris Lee, 38, has a spe­cial rit­ual: He hops onto a seat at the back of the bus, switches on his voice recorder and lis­tens to the mu­sic of the mov­ing ve­hi­cle’s en­gine.</p>
    <p>“I can recog­nise the gear­box based on its sound,” he says. “The Ger­man ZF gear­box pro­duces a whin­ing sound when the gears change. I call it the ‘cat howl’.</p>
    <p>“For the Voith gear­box, when the bus is slow­ing down, there is a whistling sound.”</p>
    <p>Mr Lee has been pas­sion­ate about buses since he was a child. He pho­to­graphs buses, cre­ates repli­cas of bus signs and tin­kers with minia­ture bus mod­els. He also keeps a range of mem­o­ra­bilia in his Hous­ing Board flat in Cle­menti, such as speedome­ters, li­cence plates and elec­tronic signs from scrap­yards.</p>
    <p>One of his favourite items is the des­ti­na­tion sign for ser­vice 166, which has “World Trade Cen­tre” (now known as Har­bourFront Cen­tre) printed on it.</p>
    <p>An­other is an old ticket ma­chine, picked up in a Chi­na­town flea mar­ket, which comes with a ro­tary dial and likely dates back to the 1940s. He be­lieves it was a pro­to­type from the Sin­ga­pore Trac­tion Com­pany.</p>
    <p>He is in­ter­ested in new buses such as ser­vice 272 – an SBS Tran­sit Mercedes-Benz Ci­taro hy­brid – and the new elec­tric dou­bledecker buses.</p>
    <p>Tech­ni­cal as­pects aside, he loves buses be­cause he thinks they are a good way to ex­plore dif­fer­ent parts of Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>He has a soft spot for ser­vice 166, a “scenic route” that plies be­tween Ang Mo Kio and Cle­menti. He is also fond of 145, which passes through Kam­pong Glam, City Hall, Chi­na­town and Tan­jong Pa­gar.</p>
    <p>Other routes like ser­vice 174 have in­spired un­ex­pected de­tours. He says that once, when the bus passed through Jurong, he spot­ted a route into a for­est and hopped off to get a closer look. It led him to an old tomb­stone.</p>
    <p>Th­ese days, he says, bus apps and so­cial me­dia have made it eas­ier for bus spot­ters to keep track of buses. One does not have to spend so much time camp­ing out on roads, wait­ing for a bus to ar­rive.</p>
    <p>But pub­lic buses are “get­ting a bit ster­ile – there are only a few mod­els now”, he says.</p>
    <p>He misses the non-air-con­di­tioned buses, which were phased out around the early 2010s.</p>
    <p>“There used to be air-con­di­tioned as well as non-air-con­di­tioned buses. On days when I wanted to</p>
    <p>There used to be non-air-con­di­tioned buses. On days when I wanted to feel the wind on my face and get a clearer view of the city, I could ride a non-air-con­di­tioned bus. You could hear peo­ple sell­ing stuff in the shop­houses in Chi­na­town and smell the aroma of the food.</p>

    <p>“Last time, air-con­di­tioned buses were like a lux­ury. Buses are now get­ting safer, qui­eter and more com­fort­able.”</p>
