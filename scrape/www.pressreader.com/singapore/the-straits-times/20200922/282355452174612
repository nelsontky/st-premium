    <p>LONDON • Le­ices­ter City man­ager Bren­dan Rodgers sin­gled out mid­fielder Har­vey Barnes for praise af­ter his side went top of the ta­ble on Sun­day with an en­ter­tain­ing 4-2 home de­feat of Burn­ley, the re­sult also mark­ing his 100th Premier League win.</p>
    <p>Rodgers, who nar­rowly missed out on win­ning the ti­tle with Liver­pool in 2014, was also pleased with the over­all per­for­mance of his team, who lead the stand­ings on goal dif­fer­ence.</p>
    <p>The Foxes are one of five teams who have won two of two games so far, and have a one-goal su­pe­rior dif­fer­ence over Arse­nal and Ever­ton.</p>
    <p>Wolver­hamp­ton Wan­der­ers, who beat Sh­effield United 2-0 in the first round of fix­tures, were in action against Manch­ester City yes­ter­day in search of a sec­ond win.</p>
    <p>“Har­vey Barnes was out­stand­ing tonight, he keeps on get­ting into ar­eas you want him to and is a big ta­lent,” Rodgers said on the BBC of the 22-year-old. “He has won­der­ful abil­ity, great run­ning power, lasts the whole game, takes you up the pitch from deep pos­ses­sion and is im­prov­ing all the time.”</p>
    <p>Barnes equalised i n the 20th minute – af­ter they fell be­hind to an early Chris Wood strike – fol­low­ing some good work by Jamie Vardy. The striker shook off two de­fend­ers and laid the ball back un­selfishly to Ti­mothy Castagne who in turn squared it for Barnes to side-foot it home.</p>
    <p>Castagne racked up an­other as­sist in the 50th minute as his fizzing low cross to Vardy was turned into his own net by Erik Pi­eters, with Le­ices­ter mov­ing up a gear af­ter the break.</p>
    <p>James Justin net­ted Le­ices­ter’s third around the hour mark, be­fore Jimmy Dunne pulled one back for the vis­i­tors in the 73rd minute.</p>
    <p>Barnes then de­liv­ered a fine pass for Den­nis Praet to seal vic­tory with a su­perb shot from 18 me­tres.</p>
    <p>Rodgers, who led Le­ices­ter to a fifth-placed fin­ish last term as they missed out on Cham­pi­ons League foot­ball on the fi­nal day of the sea­son, said the Foxes must keep their feet on the ground af­ter a good start. “We stay calm, it’s only the sec­ond game. We hope to get bet­ter as the sea­son goes on,” he said.</p>
    <p>“How we fin­ished in terms of league po­si­tion last sea­son was</p>
    <p>great and we want to build on that. We aim to be com­pet­i­tive with the ta­lent we have.”</p>
    <p>Barnes added that a stut­ter­ing fin­ish last term had gal­vanised Le­ices­ter to make a fly­ing start to their new Premier League cam­paign.</p>
    <p>“We spoke be­fore the game that it was a long time since we won back-to-back matches so it was im­por­tant to get the re­sult,” he said.</p>
    <p>“At the back end of last sea­son we weren’t up to scratch and had to im­prove.”</p>
