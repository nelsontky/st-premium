    <p>PARIS • Hun­dreds of rev­ellers were booked for break­ing coro­n­avirus re­stric­tions as an il­le­gal rave i n north-western France ended yes­ter­day af­ter more than two days of par­ty­ing that saw clashes with police.</p>
    <p>Police had failed to stop the un­der­ground event, which drew around 2,500 peo­ple from Thurs­day night in two dis­used ware­houses in Lieu­ron, south of the city of Rennes in Brit­tany.</p>
    <p>Such mass gath­er­ings are banned across France to pre­vent the spread of Covid-19, and a na­tion­wide 8pm cur­few – which was not lifted for the New Year – also ap­plies across the coun­try.</p>
    <p>Techno mu­sic had blared out dur­ing the night from the ware­houses, which had been trans­formed into il­le­gal night­clubs for party-go­ers who had flocked to the site from across France and even from abroad.</p>
    <p>The lo­cal pre­fec­ture said yes­ter­day that the mu­sic had been switched off and sound sys­tems dis­man­tled af­ter two nights, and the first rev­ellers be­gan leav­ing the site be­fore dawn.</p>
    <p>In­te­rior Min­is­ter Ger­ald Dar­manin said in a tweet that police had booked more than 1,200 peo­ple and seized a truck, sound equip­ment and gen­er­a­tors from the site of the “il­le­gal rave party”. He said the large police pres­ence at the site had led to the break-up of the event “with­out vi­o­lence”.</p>
    <p>Re­gional pre­fect Em­manuel Berthier said 800 peo­ple had been booked for fail­ing to re­spect the cur­few re­stric­tions or for gath­er­ing il­le­gally. Sev­eral hun­dred oth­ers were fined for us­ing drugs.</p>
    <p>The French au­thor­i­ties have been wor­ried about mass rave par­ties through­out the pan­demic, but New Year’s Eve was a par­tic­u­lar con­cern.</p>
    <p>On Thurs­day night, party-go­ers who re­sisted the police’s at­tempt to break up the event set one of their cars on fire and threw bot­tles and stones, the pre­fec­ture said on Fri­day.</p>
    <p>The re­gional health au­thor­ity in Brit­tany called on those who took part to un­dergo coro­n­avirus tests and self-iso­late im­me­di­ately for seven days. “They have put their lives in dan­ger, their health, they must now pro­tect those around them,” it said.</p>
    <p>Fac­ing the threat of a new wave of in­fec­tions, the French govern­ment an­nounced on Fri­day it was bring­ing for­ward its night time cur­few by two hours – from 8pm to 6pm – in 15 re­gions.</p>
    <p>The coun­try recorded around 20,000 new cases and 133 deaths on Fri­day, bring­ing the to­tal num­ber of fa­tal­i­ties to al­most 64,800.</p>
