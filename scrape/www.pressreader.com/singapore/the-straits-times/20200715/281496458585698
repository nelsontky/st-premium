    <p>While this year’s Na­tional Day Pa­rade (NDP) is poised to be a unique af­fair, with many peo­ple go­ing to cel­e­brate at home in­stead of at a cen­tral lo­ca­tion, its theme song is a trib­ute to Sin­ga­pore­ans’ spirit of com­mu­nity.</p>
    <p>Com­posed by pro­ducer Joshua Wan and per­formed by singer Nathan Hartono, Ev­ery­thing I Am also en­cour­ages Sin­ga­pore­ans to ex­press grat­i­tude and ap­pre­ci­a­tion for one an­other.</p>
    <p>The song had been planned since last year, and while the Covid-19 pan­demic has put to rest the usual NDP ar­range­ments, it has made the song’s mes­sage all the more salient.</p>
    <p>Dr Syd­ney Tan, mu­sic di­rec­tor for this year’s NDP, said the song was orig­i­nally writ­ten for a nor­mal cli­mate, but its mes­sage also ap­plies in the midst of the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>The ac­com­pa­ny­ing mu­sic video, which was di­rected by lo­cal film­maker He Shum­ing, was re­leased yes­ter­day on YouTube and the NDP web­site. Mr He said he was in­spired by real-life sto­ries of Sin­ga­pore­ans, and sought to cre­ate an in­ti­mate video that would en­cour­age Sin­ga­pore­ans to rally to­gether.</p>
    <p>“I hope... Sin­ga­pore­ans, af­ter they watch the mu­sic video... think about the peo­ple around us who have im­pacted us and in­spired us.</p>
    <p>“It’s been a chal­leng­ing year, but I hope Sin­ga­pore­ans will re­mem­ber that we’re never alone and that we can get through this to­gether.”</p>
    <p>The hus­band-and-wife team of Mr Daniel Tan and Madam Clara Loh, who run OK Chicken Rice in Ang Mo Kio, are among those fea­tured. Amid the pan­demic, the cou­ple de­liv­ered free chicken rice to health­care work­ers, send­ing more than 10,000 packs to work­ers in var­i­ous hos­pi­tals over about two months. They also started an on­line cam­paign, Cheer Up, for mem­bers of the pub­lic to make do­na­tions to off­set their de­liv­ery costs.</p>
    <p>Hip-hop group Redea­f­i­na­tion, which com­prises in­di­vid­u­als from the deaf com­mu­nity who make use of vi­bra­tions through the floor to keep in time with the mu­sic, chore­ographed moves in the Ev­ery­thing I Am video.</p>
    <p>Come Makan With Me, a groundup ini­tia­tive in which lo­cals in­vite mi­grant work­ers to their homes to share a meal and learn more about them, is also seen in ac­tion.</p>
    <p>It was started by Dr Mo­hamad Farid, who vol­un­teers with the Mi­grant Work­ers’ Cen­tre.</p>
    <p>In all, 55 sto­ries of ev­ery­day Sin­ga­pore­ans who have stepped up in the fight against Covid-19 and helped those in need will be fea­tured in this year’s NDP, which will be split into two shows.</p>
    <p>Bri­gadier-Gen­eral Fred­er­ick Choo, chair­man of this year’s NDP ex­ec­u­tive com­mit­tee, said: “Through these sto­ries, we hope to in­spire Sin­ga­pore­ans to con­tinue play­ing their part to build a bet­ter and stronger Sin­ga­pore, and to re­mind us that to­gether, we can and will pre­vail through tough times, just as we al­ways have.”</p>
    <p>The pa­rade will also fea­ture two “unity mo­ments”, which Sin­ga­pore­ans are en­cour­aged to par­tic­i­pate in as a show of sol­i­dar­ity.</p>
    <p>The first mo­ment will take place in the morn­ing, as Pres­i­dent Hal­imah Ya­cob leads the singing of the Na­tional An­them at the Padang.</p>
    <p>This will be broad­cast on TV as well as on­line plat­forms con­cur­rently with flag-rais­ing cer­e­monies tak­ing place at sev­eral lo­ca­tions is­land­wide, in­clud­ing a hos­pi­tal.</p>
    <p>The sec­ond mo­ment will take place at night, at around 8.20pm, when the pledge will be re­cited. This will also be broad­cast.</p>
    <p>BG Choo said that while this year’s NDP cel­e­bra­tions will be starkly dif­fer­ent from those of pre­vi­ous years, he hopes they will rally Sin­ga­pore­ans to come to­gether in think­ing about the na­tion’s fu­ture be­yond the cur­rent chal­lenges of Covid-19.</p>
