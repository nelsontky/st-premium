    <p>Can Don­ald Trump pull a rab­bit out of the hat and win re-elec­tion as US pres­i­dent? Not ac­cord­ing to most pun­dits, re­flect­ing the wide­spread dis­ap­proval of his job per­for­mance. But don’t write him off yet.</p>
    <p>Amid a coro­n­avirus pan­demic, a re­ces­sion, and a pe­riod of civil un­rest, it would be dif­fi­cult for any in­cum­bent to win re-elec­tion – let alone one as po­lar­is­ing as Mr Trump. He trails Demo­crat Joe Bi­den by eight points in the av­er­age of na­tional polls com­piled by the FiveThir­tyEight web­site. State-by-state polls sug­gest his path to a ma­jor­ity in the elec­toral col­lege is daunt­ing.</p>
    <p>But opin­ions about Mr Bi­den, a for­mer vice-pres­i­dent, re­main soft. Vot­ers have had lit­tle re­cent ex­po­sure to him: un­til late June, he had not held a press brief­ing for nearly three months; he still rarely leaves home or posts on so­cial me­dia. (Mr Trump’s cam­paign posts an av­er­age of 14 times daily to 28 mil­lion Face­book fol­low­ers)</p>
    <p>Po­lit­i­cal ad­vis­ers in both cam­paigns agree that Mr Bi­den’s rel­a­tive in­vis­i­bil­ity cre­ates an op­por­tu­nity for Mr Trump. He will seek to in­flu­ence the way vot­ers de­fine his ri­val – watch in the com­ing weeks as Mr Trump tries to use Mr Bi­den’s choice of a run­ning mate as a wedge.</p>
    <p>A vice-pres­i­den­tial pick can re­in­force the can­di­date’s core ap­peal, as Bill Clin­ton’s choice of a “New Demo­crat” clone in Al Gore did. Or the pick can ad­dress a gap:</p>
    <p>Barack Obama and Ge­orge W. Bush each tapped run­ning mates with na­tional se­cu­rity ex­pe­ri­ence. Mr Trump’s own selection of Mike Pence sent a re­as­sur­ing mes­sage to cul­tural con­ser­va­tives. If Mr Bi­den uses his pick to re­as­sure pro­gres­sive and left­ist vot­ers, he is likely to choose a can­di­date who has taken po­si­tions on po­lar­is­ing is­sues. This will cre­ate an open­ing for Mr Trump. Sup­port for po­lice de­fund­ing, tear­ing down of stat­ues of for­mer pres­i­dents and repa­ra­tions for slav­ery make many mod­er­ate vot­ers un­com­fort­able.</p>
    <p>For Mr Trump to ex­ploit this op­por­tu­nity, he would need to drop his of­fen­sive tributes to sym­bols and lead­ers of the Con­fed­er­acy and in­stead fo­cus at­ten­tion on what has been dubbed “can­cel cul­ture”.</p>
    <p>This cause was launched by young pro­gres­sives who call out or boy­cott pub­lic fig­ures for ob­jec­tion­able be­hav­iour. But many other Amer­i­cans worry that the move­ment is get­ting out of hand. A re­cent Cato In­sti­tute/YouGov poll found that 62 per cent of</p>
    <p>Amer­i­cans are afraid to say things they be­lieve be­cause oth­ers might find them of­fen­sive.</p>
    <p>If Mr Trump finds ways to am­plify al­le­ga­tions that some teach­ers, jour­nal­ists, busi­ness lead­ers and stu­dents have been fired or os­tracised be­cause of their be­liefs, or even mi­nor mis­steps, he could shift pub­lic opin­ion his way.</p>
    <p>Don’t count Mr Trump out be­fore the three pres­i­den­tial de­bates. It’s a fo­rum in which he ex­cels, as shown by his per­for­mance against other Repub­li­cans in 2015-16 and then against his Demo­cratic ri­val Hil­lary Clin­ton in 2016. His big­gest break would come if Mr Bi­den re­verts to the gaffe-prone style that plagued him for decades. His­tory shows this worked for Jimmy Carter against Ger­ald Ford in 1976 and for Ge­orge H. W. Bush against Michael Dukakis in 1988.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump’s chances will also im­prove if he is seen to be tak­ing the steps needed to get Covid-19 un­der con­trol while re­viv­ing the econ­omy. Both Demo­crat and Repub­li­can of­fi­cials told me that his three press brief­ings last week were a pos­i­tive step.</p>
    <p>He made it clear that the pan­demic “will get worse be­fore it gets bet­ter”, can­celled the Repub­li­can con­ven­tion, and an­nounced ac­tions on nurs­ing home tests, coro­n­avirus vac­cines and, fi­nally, urged Amer­i­cans to wear masks. On Mon­day, he trav­elled to North Carolina to hold meet­ings with a com­pany man­u­fac­tur­ing com­po­nents for a vac­cine can­di­date.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump could also make gains if there were cau­tiously op­ti­mistic news from lead­ing Western vac­cine can­di­dates, par­tic­u­larly if he is seen try­ing to as­sist and of­fer­ing reg­u­lar up­dates on progress.</p>
    <p>This year’s gen­eral elec­tion cam­paign will un­fold in an en­vi­ron­ment un­like any other in re­cent US his­tory. Un­cer­tainty around postal bal­lots and voter ac­cess, as well as Mr Trump’s usual pen­chant for cre­at­ing mini-scan­dals, only add to the un­pre­dictabil­ity. De­spite Mr Bi­den’s lead in the polls, it’s clear that there is still time for this to be­come a real race.</p>
