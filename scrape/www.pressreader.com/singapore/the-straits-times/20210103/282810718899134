    <p>Liver­pool man­ager Jur­gen Klopp be­lieves the Premier League must avoid im­ple­ment­ing a “cir­cuit-breaker” shut­down to help re­duce Covid-19 in­fec­tions, say­ing the safety mea­sures i n place will en­sure the com­pe­ti­tion is not af­fected.</p>
    <p>West Bromwich Al­bion man­ager Sam Al­lardyce had last week called for a tem­po­rary sus­pen­sion of the Premier League af­ter a record num­ber of pos­i­tive cases in a week.</p>
    <p>The surge in in­fec­tions led to the post­pone­ment of Ever­ton’s clash with Manch­ester City on Mon­day and Tot­ten­ham’s home game against Ful­ham two days later.</p>
    <p>Klopp is ready to put Liver­pool’s ti­tle de­fence on hold if needed, but stressed the role foot­ball can play in these un­cer­tain times.</p>
    <p>“It is un­der­stand­able (to have con­cerns), but we try to do every­thing to keep the boys as safe as pos­si­ble and I think the com­pe­ti­tion can go on,” he said ahead of to­mor­row’s trip to Southamp­ton.</p>
    <p>“Peo­ple want to watch it and, in this case, we are not part of so­ci­ety be­cause usu­ally we iso­late, we go to the train­ing ground and stuff like that, so I think we can carry on.</p>
    <p>“But I am not a spe­cial­ist and I re­spect all the de­ci­sions made in the next few weeks.”</p>
    <p>The Reds are top of the stand­ings on 33 points, level with Manch­ester United af­ter the Red Devils beat As­ton Villa 2-1 on Fri­day. The fierce ri­vals face each other on Jan 17 at An­field.</p>
    <p>James Mil­ner be­lieves that Liver­pool will have to “kick on” this year af­ter two dis­ap­point­ing draws (1-1 with West Brom and 0-0 with New­cas­tle) left Ole Gun­nar Sol­sk­jaer’s men breath­ing down their necks.</p>
    <p>“We’ve dropped points, ev­ery­one seems to be drop­ping points. United have had a good run and they’re prob­a­bly the only team who are putting a run to­gether,” Mil­ner said on the club web­site.</p>
    <p>“It’s im­por­tant that we need to kick on now and try to get a few three-point­ers.”</p>
    <p>Liver­pool have al­ready dropped as many points (six draws, one de­feat) in 16 matches this sea­son as they did in the whole of the pre­vi­ous cam­paign.</p>
    <p>Last sea­son, Klopp’s side did not lose a league match un­til Feb 29, hav­ing won all of their games ex­cept one – against United – up un­til that point.</p>
    <p>The unique cir­cum­stances of the 2020-21 cam­paign, with its lack of a proper pre-sea­son and a com­pressed sched­ule as a re­sult of the coro­n­avirus, meant a re­peat of Liver­pool’s run­away suc­cess was never likely.</p>
    <p>But Mil­ner, 34, ac­cepts they could still have done bet­ter de­spite their de­fen­sive in­jury cri­sis.</p>
    <p>“There’s points we’ve dropped this sea­son where we feel we could have done bet­ter. But to still be in the mix go­ing into the New Year is good, es­pe­cially with the</p>
    <p>NO MORE EX­CUSES</p>
    <p>We’ve dropped points, ev­ery­one seems to be drop­ping points... It’s im­por­tant that we need to kick on now and try to get a few three-point­ers.</p>
    <p>prob­lems we have,” he said.</p>
    <p>“But we are a qual­ity squad of play­ers who have been to­gether a long time and we are used to win­ning.</p>
    <p>“We are dis­ap­pointed not to get the three points (at New­cas­tle) but we want to get back on the win­ning track as soon as pos­si­ble.”</p>
    <p>JAMES MIL­NER, Liver­pool mid­fielder, knows his side can­not af­ford to slip up with their ri­vals wait­ing to pounce.</p>
