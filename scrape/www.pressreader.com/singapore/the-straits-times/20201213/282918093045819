    <p>“If you stand still, there is only one way to go and that’s back­wards,” Eng­land’s most-capped foot­baller Peter Shilton once re­marked, in a com­ment that was both ut­terly il­log­i­cal and yet cu­ri­ously ra­tio­nal. And yet, some­times if you try to go for­ward, you end up go­ing back­ward.</p>
    <p>Wel­come to Arse­nal, where at­tempts to fast-track progress have brought re­gres­sion.</p>
    <p>The fact that Mikel Arteta took charge at the Emi­rates Sta­dium at just 37 in­di­cated that he is a young man­ager in a hurry. That he won the FA Cup at 38 was the sign of his pre­coc­ity.</p>
    <p>He for­mu­lated a counter-at­tack­ing blue­print that was piv­otal in vic­to­ries against Manch­ester City, Liver­pool and Chelsea. And then he aban­doned it, even af­ter res­ur­rect­ing it for a win at Manch­ester United.</p>
    <p>The Spa­niard’s 3-4-3 was in­tended as a stag­ing post, an in­ven­tive use of lim­ited re­sources.</p>
    <p>The even­tual plan was to play 4-3-3, some­thing more ex­pan­sive and more at­tack­ing, al­low­ing Arse­nal to play more dom­i­nant foot­ball in op­po­si­tion ter­ri­tory.</p>
    <p>Ex­cept that it has back­fired. Vic­to­ries have been scarce, with two months elaps­ing since the Gun­ners won a league game with a back four and that was against bot­tom club Sh­effield United.</p>
    <p>Goals have dried up, with just one with a back four in that time (and even that was from a cor­ner).</p>
    <p>In­stead of cam­ou­flag­ing weak­nesses, the sys­tem has re­vealed them. In­stead of solv­ing prob­lems, it has cre­ated more.</p>
    <p>There has been a hole at the heart of the side. Arse­nal’s gravest short­com­ing is in mid­field, which Arteta had used 3-4-3 to by­pass.</p>
    <p>They have been hin­dered by the way Granit Xhaka and Dani Ceballos, who ex­celled in the sum­mer, have failed to repli­cate that form in mis­er­able cam­paigns.</p>
    <p>The in­tended an­swer, Thomas Partey, was ter­rific in that Old Traf­ford win, but was then ab­sent and then in­jured against Tot­ten­ham; Arteta de­nied it was be­cause he was rushed back, but it felt that way.</p>
    <p>Maybe 4-3-3 would work with Partey, but it does not with­out the sum­mer sign­ing and when Ainsley Mait­land-Niles is strangely side­lined. The shape has high­lighted a lack of cre­ativ­ity in cen­tral ar­eas. Clar­ity of think­ing has been re­placed by ever more con­fused think­ing. Arteta has tried Alexan­dre La­cazette as a No. 10: a not par­tic­u­larly cre­ative striker is played out of po­si­tion, mean­ing they only have two spe­cial­ist mid­field­ers.</p>
