    <p>A 33-year-old per­ma­nent res­i­dent linked to a pre­vi­ous im­ported case was the sole Covid-19 case in the com­mu­nity con­firmed yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>She was one of 313 new coro­n­avirus cases re­ported by the Min­istry of Health (MOH), tak­ing Sin­ga­pore’s to­tal to 52,825.</p>
    <p>She had been in con­tact with a pre­vi­ous im­ported case who had trav­elled to In­dia, MOH said.</p>
    <p>This pre­vi­ous case was a 13-yearold boy, who is also a PR. He had been asymp­to­matic but was con­firmed to have the virus on July 30.</p>
    <p>As he was a mi­nor who had been placed on stay-home no­tice (SHN) upon his ar­rival in Sin­ga­pore on July 19, she had re­quested to be iso­lated at the same ded­i­cated SHN fa­cil­ity with him.</p>
    <p>She first be­came symp­tomatic dur­ing iso­la­tion on July 28, and was con­firmed to have Covid-19 yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>There were also five im­ported cases who had been placed on stay-home no­tices upon ar­rival in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>Two are work pass hold­ers cur­rently em­ployed in Sin­ga­pore who</p>
    <p>New cases con­tinue to get picked up at the dorms be­cause of ex­ten­sive test­ing as part of ef­forts to ver­ify and test the sta­tus of all work­ers, said MOH.</p>
    <p>had ar­rived from In­dia sep­a­rately on July 19 and 21.</p>
    <p>An­other two are de­pen­dant’s pass hold­ers who ar­rived from Ja­pan and In­dia on July 21.</p>
    <p>The re­main­ing case is a stu­dent’s pass holder who ar­rived from In­done­sia on July 19.</p>
    <p>All of them had been placed on a 14-day SHN upon ar­rival in Sin­ga­pore, and were tested while serv­ing the stay-home pe­riod at ded­i­cated fa­cil­i­ties.</p>
    <p>Mi­grant work­ers stay­ing in dor­mi­to­ries made up the re­main­ing 307 new cases re­ported yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>New cases con­tinue to get picked up at the dorms be­cause of ex­ten­sive test­ing as part of ef­forts to ver­ify and test the sta­tus of all work­ers, said MOH.</p>
    <p>The num­ber of new com­mu­nity cases has de­creased to an av­er­age of two per day in the past week from seven the week be­fore.</p>
    <p>Un­linked cases have also de­creased across the same pe­ri­ods to an av­er­age of one daily, down from four. All the new cases con­firmed yes­ter­day were linked to known clus­ters, MOH said.</p>
    <p>The min­istry also said 186 more Covid-19 pa­tients have been dis­charged from hos­pi­tals or com­mu­nity iso­la­tion fa­cil­i­ties.</p>
    <p>This brings the to­tal num­ber of pa­tients who have fully re­cov­ered from the in­fec­tion to 46,911.</p>
    <p>There are cur­rently 109 Covid-19 pa­tients still in hos­pi­tal, with none in in­ten­sive care.</p>
    <p>A fur­ther 5,763 are iso­lated and cared for in com­mu­nity fa­cil­i­ties. Th­ese are cases who have mild symp­toms or are clin­i­cally well but still tested pos­i­tive for Covid-19.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore has seen 27 deaths from Covid-19 com­pli­ca­tions, while 15 who tested pos­i­tive have died of other causes.</p>
