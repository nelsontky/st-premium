    <p>Se­jong City is back in the lime­light.</p>
    <p>Politi­cians of South Korea’s rul­ing Demo­cratic Party of Korea are ral­ly­ing be­hind a pro­posal to move the pres­i­dent, the Na­tional Assem­bly and gov­ern­ment min­istries from Seoul to Se­jong.</p>
    <p>Named af­ter King Se­jong, whose ep­i­thet is “the Great”, the city grew out of former pres­i­dent Roh Moo-hyun’s plans to en­cour­age bal­anced re­gional devel­op­ment by mov­ing the cap­i­tal from Seoul to the cen­tre of the coun­try.</p>
    <p>The city was founded in 2007 and parts of the gov­ern­ment be­gan mov­ing to Se­jong in 2012, bring­ing its cur­rent pop­u­la­tion to 340,000.</p>
    <p>From the start, plans to make Se­jong the new cap­i­tal faced re­sis­tance.</p>
    <p>In Oc­to­ber 2004, the Con­sti­tu­tional Court ruled against mov­ing the cap­i­tal, forc­ing then Pres­i­dent Roh to limit the move to gov­ern­ment min­istries and agen­cies.</p>
    <p>As the cap­i­tal, Seoul re­mained a “spe­cial city”, and Se­jong gained the cum­ber­some ti­tle of “spe­cial self-gov­ern­ing city”.</p>
    <p>Though the city has yet to be­come the cap­i­tal, the de­bate over its fu­ture prompted the gov­ern­ment to con­tinue de­cen­tral­i­sa­tion by mov­ing pub­lic com­pa­nies and agen­cies to other re­gional cities in ad­di­tion to Se­jong.</p>
    <p>Ef­forts to re­duce the con­cen­tra­tion of jobs and peo­ple in Seoul have a long his­tory in</p>
    <p>South Korea.</p>
    <p>In the mid-1970s, pres­i­dent Park Chung-hee pushed the idea of build­ing a new cap­i­tal to slow the growth of then-boom­ing Seoul and of­fer greater pro­tec­tion in case of a North Korean in­va­sion.</p>
    <p>The plans faded with Park’s as­sas­si­na­tion in 1979, but pres­i­dent</p>
    <p>Chun Doo-hwan be­gan to push his own plans by mov­ing gov­ern­ment re­search cen­tres and en­cour­ag­ing cor­po­rate re­search cen­tres to move to Dae­jeon.</p>
    <p>The growth of the city as a high-tech re­search cen­tre con­tin­ued in the 1990s.</p>
    <p>The ef­forts to de­cen­tralise Seoul from the 1970s to the 1990s fo­cused on slow­ing the pop­u­la­tion growth and en­hanc­ing na­tional se­cu­rity.</p>
    <p>By the time Mr Roh be­came pres­i­dent, Seoul’s pop­u­la­tion had stopped grow­ing and, with the end of the Cold War, fear of a North Korean in­va­sion had also de­creased.</p>
    <p>Mr Roh pushed the new cap­i­tal as a step to­wards bal­anced devel­op­ment that would help re­duce the gap be­tween Seoul and other parts of the coun­try.</p>
    <p>Se­jong was only part of a broader push that in­cluded greater re­gional au­ton­omy and var­i­ous other mea­sures.</p>
    <p>The cur­rent push to move the cap­i­tal to Se­jong comes from con­cern over sky­rock­et­ing home prices in Seoul.</p>
    <p>Mov­ing the cap­i­tal, sup­port­ers ar­gue, will re­duce de­mand for hous­ing in Seoul, which will slow the hous­ing mar­ket.</p>
    <p>In the long his­tory of mov­ing cap­i­tals, this ar­gu­ment is un­usual.</p>
    <p>Through­out his­tory, most moves have come from sym­bol­ism re­lated to na­tion build­ing.</p>
    <p>Tokyo and Brasilia are clas­sic ex­am­ples, but there are many oth­ers.</p>
    <p>In 1868, Ja­pan moved the cap­i­tal from Ky­oto, where it had been since AD 794, to Edo, which was re­named Tokyo, to sym­bol­ise the cre­ation of a new state mod­elled af­ter Western pow­ers.</p>
    <p>In 1956, Brazil pushed the devel­op­ment of a new cap­i­tal in the in­te­rior of the coun­try to foster bal­anced re­gional devel­op­ment.</p>
    <p>The cap­i­tal moved from coastal Rio de Janeiro to Brasilia in 1960.</p>
    <p>More re­cently, over­crowd­ing has also been an im­por­tant rea­son for mov­ing cap­i­tal cities.</p>
    <p>In 2015, Egypt be­gan build­ing a new cap­i­tal near Cairo to re­duce crowd­ing in the city.</p>
    <p>Re­cently, In­done­sia de­cided to build a new cap­i­tal to re­duce crowd­ing in Jakarta, which is also in­creas­ingly be­ing threat­ened by ris­ing sea lev­els.</p>
    <p>How­ever, mov­ing the cap­i­tal to Se­jong to re­duce pres­sure on real es­tate prices in Seoul stands lit­tle chance of suc­cess be­cause the city is too small and too close to Seoul to draw peo­ple away.</p>
    <p>Gov­ern­ment work­ers would have to move, but many of them would end up keep­ing their fam­i­lies in Seoul any­way.</p>
    <p>Gov­ern­ment min­istries and agen­cies have al­ready moved, with no im­pact on home prices.</p>
    <p>The price of hous­ing, like other com­modi­ties, is based on sup­ply and de­mand sprin­kled with emo­tion.</p>
    <p>Prices are ris­ing in Seoul be­cause there is more de­mand than sup­ply and be­cause peo­ple be­lieve that prices will keep ris­ing.</p>
    <p>The best way to deal with the prob­lem is to in­crease sup­ply by build­ing more houses and re­duc­ing de­mand by re­duc­ing com­mut­ing times from nearby ar­eas.</p>
    <p>Struc­tural re­forms to en­cour­age the con­struc­tion of smaller, less ex­pen­sive houses for pur­chase or rent will also help.</p>
    <p>As the cap­i­tal of a coun­try of South Korea’s global stand­ing, Se­jong comes up short.</p>
    <p>It is ar­chi­tec­turally bor­ing and lacks cul­tural amenities.</p>
    <p>It lacks a KTX high-speed train sta­tion and, like so many planned cities, is not very walk­a­ble.</p>
    <p>In­stead of doubling down on Se­jong, politi­cians should leave it as is and fo­cus their ef­forts on more press­ing is­sues. ed­u­ca­tion, is a colum­nist with The Korea Her­ald. The pa­per is a mem­ber of The Straits Times me­dia part­ner Asia News Net­work, an al­liance of 24 news me­dia ti­tles.</p>
