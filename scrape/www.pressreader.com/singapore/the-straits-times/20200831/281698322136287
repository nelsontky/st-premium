    <p>SEOUL • South Korea re­ported its 17th day of triple-digit rise in coro­n­avirus in­fec­tions yes­ter­day, as re­stric­tions on din­ing in at restau­rants, pubs and bak­eries in the densely pop­u­lated Seoul area took ef­fect.</p>
    <p>There were 299 new in­fec­tions as of mid­night on Saturday, the slow­est daily rise in five days, bring­ing the na­tional tally to 19,699 cases of the coro­n­avirus and 323 Covid-19 deaths, the Korea Cen­tres for Dis­ease Con­trol and Preven­tion (KCDC) said.</p>
    <p>Last Friday, the coun­try ex­tended phase two so­cial dis­tanc­ing rules – the sec­ond strictest level – for at least an­other week and an­nounced tougher rules on places with high risks of virus spread.</p>
    <p>Din­ing in at restau­rants, pubs and bak­eries in the Seoul area has been banned be­tween 9pm and 5am, while cof­fee shops, some of which have been iden­ti­fied as hot spots, are re­stricted to take­away and de­liv­ery un­til mid­night on Sun­day.</p>
    <p>Churches, night­clubs, in­door sports fa­cil­i­ties and most schools in the area are al­ready closed, and masks are manda­tory in pub­lic places.</p>
    <p>The spike in cases has de­pleted hos­pi­tal fa­cil­i­ties, with the Health Min­istry re­port­ing on Saturday that just 4.5 per cent of beds in the greater Seoul area were avail­able for crit­i­cal cases as of Friday, down from 22 per cent a week ear­lier.</p>
    <p>The KCDC has said that more than 1,000 cases have been traced to the Sarang Jeil Church in Seoul, which is at the cen­tre of the new wave of in­fec­tions.</p>
    <p>Deal­ing with the sec­ond wave of in­fec­tions has been com­pli­cated by an on­go­ing strike of al­most 16,000 in­tern and res­i­dent doc­tors. The medics walked out on Aug 21, in a dis­pute over the govern­ment’s plans to boost the num­ber of doc­tors to bet­ter deal with health crises like the coro­n­avirus.</p>
    <p>The Health Min­istry ear­lier last week filed a po­lice com­plaint against at least 10 doc­tors and ex­tended a back-to-work or­der for the doc­tors, who are the back­bone of health­care ser­vices i n emer­gency rooms and in­ten­sive care units.</p>
