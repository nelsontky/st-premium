    <p>Two po­lit­i­cal of­fice-hold­ers were sworn in yes­ter­day in a cer­e­mony at the Is­tana of­fi­ci­ated by Pres­i­dent Hal­imah Ya­cob.</p>
    <p>They are Mr Baey Yam Keng, 49, who will be Se­nior Par­lia­men­tary Sec­re­tary for Trans­port, and Mr Eric Chua, 41, who will be Par­lia­men­tary Sec­re­tary for Cul­ture, Com­mu­nity and Youth as well as for So­cial and Fam­ily De­vel­op­ment.</p>
    <p>Par­lia­men­tary sec­re­taries are MPs who have been ap­pointed to help min­is­ters dis­charge their func­tions and du­ties.</p>
    <p>The ap­point­ments were an­nounced on July 25, to­gether with other changes in the Cab­i­net af­ter the gen­eral elec­tion.</p>
    <p>Prime Min­is­ter Lee Hsien Loong also at­tended yes­ter­day’s cer­e­mony held in the West Draw­ing Room of the Is­tana.</p>
    <p>Mr Baey, who joined pol­i­tics in 2006 and was pro­moted to Se­nior Par­lia­men­tary Sec­re­tary in 2018, con­tin­ues to serve at the Min­istry of Trans­port (MOT) but has re­lin­quished his pre­vi­ous role in the Min­istry of Cul­ture, Com­mu­nity and Youth (MCCY).</p>
    <p>Ms Ra­hayu Mahzam, 40, has also been pro­moted from the back­benches to be­come Par­lia­men­tary Sec­re­tary for Health, but this change will come into ef­fect only from Sept 1.</p>
    <p>Speak­ing to The Straits Times af­ter the cer­e­mony, Mr Baey said he looks for­ward to learn­ing from and work­ing with new Trans­port Min­is­ter Ong Ye Kung, who was ed­u­ca­tion min­is­ter be­fore the Cab­i­net reshuf­fle, as well as other po­lit­i­cal of­fice-hold­ers and of­fi­cers in MOT.</p>
    <p>He added that there is also work to be done in terms of deep­en­ing bi­lat­eral ties with Malaysia at the min­istry. “There are ex­cit­ing projects ahead that hope­fully can ma­te­ri­alise, and which can also con­trib­ute to­wards greater friend­ships be­tween our two peo­ples.”</p>
    <p>At MOT, he will be fo­cus­ing on is­sues re­lated to ac­tive mo­bil­ity, in­clud­ing im­prov­ing in­fra­struc­ture, en­hanc­ing the reg­u­la­tory frame­work and pro­mot­ing first- and last­mile con­nec­tiv­ity.</p>
    <p>Mr Chua is a new face from the Peo­ple’s Ac­tion Party who was elected as an MP for Tan­jong Pa­gar</p>
    <p>GRC in the re­cent polls.</p>
    <p>He said he has much to learn as a new MP and a po­lit­i­cal of­fice­holder. But he be­lieves his ex­pe­ri­ence and in­ter­ests, such as in mu­sic and in vol­un­teer­ing with youth, can help him to serve in his new roles. He is a for­mer di­rec­tor of the SGSe­cure Pro­gramme Of­fice.</p>
    <p>He added that he hopes to work hard to help al­le­vi­ate the suf­fer­ing that var­i­ous sec­tors or groups have been go­ing through be­cause of the Covid-19 cri­sis.</p>
    <p>Mr Baey pointed out that he was Mr Chua’s pre­de­ces­sor on two fronts – not only had he served in MCCY be­fore Mr Chua, but he was also MP from 2006 to 2011 for the Queen­stown ward which Mr Chua will now be in charge of.</p>
    <p>“I will def­i­nitely be call­ing him (Mr Baey) for ad­vice,” said Mr Chua.</p>
    <p>“And I’ll be wait­ing for his treat to a meal,” Mr Baey said, with a laugh.</p>
