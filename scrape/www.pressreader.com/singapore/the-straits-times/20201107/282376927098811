    <p>When New Zealand Prime Min­is­ter Jacinda Ardern romped to a mas­sive elec­tion win last month, many cited fac­tors such as her charisma, com­pe­tence and suc­cess in tack­ling Covid-19.</p>
    <p>But well be­fore the pan­demic, she had built a rep­u­ta­tion for pol­icy in­no­va­tions such as New Zealand’s “Well-be­ing Bud­get”, launched last year.</p>
    <p>The Bud­get has five pri­or­ity ar­eas: tran­si­tion­ing to a sus­tain­able and low-emis­sions econ­omy; thriv­ing in a dig­i­tal age; lift­ing the in­comes of in­dige­nous Maori and Pa­cific Is­lan­ders; re­duc­ing child poverty; and im­prov­ing men­tal health for all.</p>
    <p>“We’re em­bed­ding that no­tion of mak­ing de­ci­sions that aren’t just about growth for growth’s sake, but how are our peo­ple far­ing?” Ms Ardern had ex­plained. “How is their over­all well-be­ing and their men­tal health? How is our en­vi­ron­ment do­ing? These are the mea­sures that will give us a true mea­sure of our suc­cess.”</p>
    <p>A GOOD WAY OF LIV­ING</p>
    <p>New Zealand is not the only coun­try to take na­tional well-be­ing se­ri­ously.</p>
    <p>In the 1970s, the tiny Hi­malayan king­dom of Bhutan led the way with the con­cept of Gross Na­tional Hap­pi­ness, which later evolved into a hap­pi­ness in­dex. Among other things, the in­dex mea­sures psy­cho­log­i­cal well-be­ing and com­mu­nity vi­tal­ity.</p>
    <p>Ecuador – in­spired by its in­dige­nous tra­di­tions that pri­ori­tise har­mony with na­ture – en­shrined the prin­ci­ple of “buen vivir”, or a good way of liv­ing, in its Con­sti­tu­tion.</p>
    <p>The United Arab Emi­rates has a Min­is­ter of State for Hap­pi­ness, and a na­tional hap­pi­ness and well-be­ing pro­gramme which, dur­ing the Covid-19 pan­demic, sought to of­fer free on­line men­tal health sup­port.</p>
    <p>And if this wasn’t enough, the United King­dom in 2018 made MP Tracey Crouch the Min­is­ter for Lone­li­ness to tackle the scourge of so­cial iso­la­tion.</p>
    <p>Ex­plic­itly in­te­grat­ing well-be­ing into gov­ern­ment pol­icy is an idea that has gained trac­tion among in­ter­na­tional or­gan­i­sa­tions too, with the United Na­tions call­ing on coun­tries to place more em­pha­sis on hap­pi­ness as a mea­sure­ment of so­cial and eco­nomic de­vel­op­ment.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore does not per­form too shab­bily on this count. It ranked No. 31 out of 153 coun­tries and ter­ri­to­ries on the UN’s World Hap­pi­ness Re­port, the sec­ond hap­pi­est be­hind Tai­wan (No. 25) in Asia in March.</p>
    <p>MANY INI­TIA­TIVES</p>
    <p>Yet this year, Covid-19 has brought lit­tle joy to Sin­ga­pore­ans’ lives.</p>
    <p>From April 7 to May 6, po­lice re­ports re­lat­ing to fam­ily vi­o­lence spiked by 22 per cent com­pared with just be­fore the cir­cuit breaker.</p>
    <p>Sa­mar­i­tans of Sin­ga­pore – which fo­cuses on sui­cide pre­ven­tion – re­ceived around 5,000 more calls for help from Jan­uary to Au­gust, com­pared with dur­ing the same pe­riod last year.</p>
    <p>Af­ter the gen­eral elec­tion in July – one that saw the rul­ing party’s vote share slide to 61.24 per cent – sur­veys have shown that peo­ple care not just about the econ­omy or the strength of in­di­vid­ual poli­cies, but also about in­tan­gi­ble fac­tors such as a de­sire for po­lit­i­cal di­ver­sity, and per­cep­tions of “fair­ness”.</p>
    <p>Recog­nis­ing this, the Gov­ern­ment has em­barked on a wide ar­ray of na­tional, as well as sec­tor-spe­cific, con­ver­sa­tions and work groups.</p>
    <p>The main ones in­clude the Emerg­ing Stronger Task Force to guide Sin­ga­pore’s post-eco­nomic re­cov­ery; and Emerg­ing Stronger Con­ver­sa­tions with Sin­ga­pore­ans – now ex­panded to in­clude peo­ple with dis­abil­i­ties and lan­guages other than English.</p>
    <p>The in­dus­try-led Sin­ga­pore To­gether Al­liances for Ac­tion are be­ing formed to pro­to­type ideas in ar­eas such as ro­bot­ics and e-com­merce, and to cre­ate new jobs in growth ar­eas.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore To­gether Ac­tion Net­works – part­ner­ships in­volv­ing the Gov­ern­ment, com­mu­nity and busi­nesses – have been formed to cre­ate and de­liver solutions, in­clud­ing those that help dis­ad­van­taged stu­dents, sup­port vul­ner­a­ble fam­i­lies and ad­dress men­tal well-be­ing among young peo­ple.</p>
    <p>Then there are ini­tia­tives which fo­cus on spe­cific groups of Sin­ga­pore­ans, such as a tri­par­tite group on how to raise the wages of low-in­come work­ers.</p>
    <p>There will also be a com­pre­hen­sive re­view of is­sues af­fect­ing women here, called Con­ver­sa­tions on Women De­vel­op­ment, which will cul­mi­nate in a White Pa­per.</p>
    <p>WELL-BE­ING IN PRAC­TICE</p>
    <p>One can imag­ine the slew of re­ports and ac­tion plans that will come out in the next year or two.</p>
    <p>While the out­come is clear to pol­i­cy­mak­ers who are in the trenches, some Sin­ga­pore­ans may feel it is one re­port too many.</p>
    <p>Is there a way to con­nect the dots?</p>
    <p>New Zealand’s Well-be­ing Bud­get is in­struc­tive.</p>
    <p>First, the gov­ern­ment has kept it sim­ple with just five pri­or­i­ties.</p>
    <p>These can be eas­ily un­der­stood by the public. Gov­ern­ment agen­cies, too, can plan with a set of well-be­ing-ori­ented goals in mind.</p>
    <p>Sec­ond, it treats public poli­cies as in­vest­ments.</p>
    <p>Funds are al­lo­cated in ways that will gen­er­ate pos­i­tive re­turns for so­ci­ety and bring down fu­ture fis­cal li­a­bil­i­ties. For ex­am­ple, a large chunk of the Bud­get – NZ$1.9 bil­lion (S$1.7 bil­lion) – is de­voted to men­tal health.</p>
    <p>Third, to mon­i­tor out­comes mean­ing­fully, it adopts a liv­ing stan­dards frame­work with over 60 in­di­ca­tors.</p>
    <p>These in­di­ca­tors take into ac­count both cur­rent and fu­ture well-be­ing across four in­ter­linked “cap­i­tals”: the fi­nan­cial/phys­i­cal, nat­u­ral, hu­man and so­cial.</p>
    <p>NEW GOALS TO IN­SPIRE</p>
    <p>The point here is not that Sin­ga­pore has to ap­point a</p>
    <p>Min­is­ter for Well-be­ing.</p>
    <p>All gov­ern­ment poli­cies are fun­da­men­tally about peo­ple’s well-be­ing, whether or not they are la­belled as such.</p>
    <p>But it could be worth­while hav­ing an over­all set of as­pi­ra­tional goals, to pull to­gether the dif­fer­ent con­ver­sa­tions and work groups.</p>
    <p>These would lay out where Sin­ga­pore is headed over the next few years, and what Sin­ga­pore­ans’ place is in their coun­try’s fu­ture.</p>
    <p>Could this be framed as five or six key pri­or­i­ties, a state­ment of val­ues, or even a sim­ple pledge that Sin­ga­pore­ans’ well-be­ing will be taken care of across dif­fer­ent di­men­sions?</p>
    <p>The out­comes could be tracked with a com­bi­na­tion of ex­ist­ing as well as new in­di­ca­tors.</p>
    <p>Some ar­eas have emerged dur­ing the pan­demic that pro­vide food for thought.</p>
    <p>There is the im­me­di­ate ur­gency to an­chor new sec­tors and ac­tiv­i­ties here, to drive growth and cre­ate good jobs.</p>
    <p>There is also a need to bridge the dig­i­tal di­vide for older Sin­ga­pore­ans.</p>
    <p>Many have called for more sup­port for the lower-in­come, and a kinder and more in­clu­sive so­ci­ety.</p>
    <p>Oth­ers de­sire greater po­lit­i­cal di­ver­sity and mul­ti­ple path­ways to suc­cess.</p>
    <p>As Deputy Prime Min­is­ter Heng Swee Keat said dur­ing a na­tional broad­cast in June: “As we build a stronger econ­omy, we must also strengthen our so­ci­ety.”</p>
    <p>He also made this prom­ise, in which the seeds of such a new so­cial com­pact may be found: “Be as­sured that, in Sin­ga­pore, no one will be left to walk alone. You will be cared for if you fall on hard times. You will be part of our so­ci­ety’s progress, no mat­ter your start­ing point or cir­cum­stances.”</p>
    <p>Hap­pi­ness may wax and wane, but a rea­son­able goal at the end of this na­tional ef­fort is for ev­ery Sin­ga­porean to be able to say, with con­fi­dence:</p>
    <p>“I know the Gov­ern­ment works for me and with me.</p>
    <p>“I am treated fairly, I have what I need, and can bounce back when times are tough.</p>
    <p>“I know who I can turn to for help, and I feel sup­ported and loved.”</p>
    <p>What is Sin­ga­pore’s buen vivir, our good way of liv­ing?</p>
    <p>Half a cen­tury af­ter in­de­pen­dence, the ex­is­ten­tial search con­tin­ues.</p>
    <p>One hopes that the na­tion will find the an­swer it needs sooner rather than later, which is why the con­ver­sa­tions that are be­ing held now are so cru­cial.</p>
