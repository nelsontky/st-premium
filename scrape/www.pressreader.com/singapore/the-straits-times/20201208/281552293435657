    <p>In­vestors gave a big thumbs-up to the win­ners of the Re­pub­lic’s dig­i­tal full bank li­cences, send­ing the share prices of Sing­tel and Sea to his­tor­i­cal highs. Sing­tel’s shares rose as much as 11 per cent yes­ter­day, while New York-listed Sea’s shares rose 8.3 per cent last Fri­day to a record high of US$198.78 apiece.</p>
    <p>From Sin­ga­pore to New York, in­vestors gave a big thumbs up to the win­ners of the Re­pub­lic’s dig­i­tal full bank li­cences, send­ing the share prices of Sing­tel and Sea to his­tor­i­cal highs.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, shares of the big three banks – DBS, OCBC and United Over­seas Bank – that dom­i­nate the tra­di­tional bank­ing land­scape here took a hit.</p>
    <p>The con­cur­rent buy­ing and sell­off could sug­gest that a plu­ral­ity of in­vestors be­lieve the new­com­ers stand a chance of a mean­ing­ful com­pe­ti­tion with the in­cum­bent tra­di­tional banks, an­a­lysts say. Shares of Sing­tel, South-east Asia’s top telecom­mu­ni­ca­tions op­er­a­tor, rose as much as 11 per­cent yes­ter­day, the big­gest per­cent­age gain since Oc­to­ber 2008.</p>
    <p>The stock was the top gainer by value on the Sin­ga­pore Ex­change. At clos­ing, it was up 2.99 per cent to $2.41, with a share turnover of 102 mil­lion.</p>
    <p>New York-listed Sea’s shares rose 8.3 per cent last Fri­day to a record high of US$198.78 apiece af­ter the Mon­e­tary Au­thor­ity of Sin­ga­pore’s an­nounce­ment.</p>
    <p>Founded in 2009 by Chi­ne­se­born en­tre­pre­neur For­rest Li, who has since be­come a Sin­ga­pore cit­i­zen, Sea now boasts a mar­ket val­u­a­tion of more than US$90 bil­lion (S$120 bil­lion).</p>
    <p>DBS shares fell as much as 1.8 per cent yes­ter­day, while OCBC and UOB saw their shares de­cline by more than 1 per cent.</p>
    <p>Mr Umair Hameed, part­ner for fi­nan­cial ser­vices ad­vi­sory at KPMG in Sin­ga­pore, said tech­nol­o­gy­driven chal­lengers are in­creas­ingly dis­rupt­ing the business mod­els of in­dus­try lead­ers world­wide.</p>
    <p>He said dig­i­tal banks’ big­gest ad­van­tage is that they are un­bur­dened by tra­di­tional banks’ legacy sys­tems in pro­cesses, skills and in­fra­struc­ture.</p>
    <p>“This will likely con­tinue to im­pact the tra­di­tional banks, un­less they can trans­form or over­haul quickly,” he said.</p>
    <p>Some an­a­lysts said the share price moves were more co­in­ci­den­tal than re­lated, given that the dig­i­tal banks are ex­pected to start op­er­a­tions only by early 2022.</p>
    <p>Mr Eu­gene Tarz­i­manov, vi­cepres­i­dent and se­nior credit of­fi­cer at Moody’s In­vestors Ser­vice, said the newly awarded dig­i­tal bank­ing li­cences pose a lim­ited threat to DBS, OCBC and UOB.</p>
    <p>“How­ever, com­pe­ti­tion will heat up for the smaller for­eign-owned Sin­ga­porean banks that have mod­est do­mes­tic op­er­a­tions, and thus face the great­est dis­rup­tion risk from the en­trants,” he added.</p>
    <p>Mr Tarz­i­manov was re­fer­ring to Sin­ga­pore’s qual­i­fy­ing full banks, which can take cus­tomer de­posits but can open only lim­ited branches here. Th­ese in­clude Stan­dard Char­tered Bank, Citibank, HSBC and May­bank.</p>
    <p>Mr Sachin Mit­tal, eq­uity an­a­lyst at DBS, who has a “buy” rec­om­men­da­tion on Sing­tel, said it may take up to four or five years for the dig­i­tal bank en­trants to break even.</p>
    <p>It also re­mains to be seen if Sing­tel can pro­vide dig­i­tal fi­nan­cial ser­vices out­side Sin­ga­pore, which can boost the value of its dig­i­tal bank­ing business, he said.</p>
    <p>The po­ten­tial is there, Mr Mit­tal added.</p>
    <p>Sing­tel has a sub­scriber base of 4.3 mil­lion as at June.</p>
    <p>Still, given the ex­pe­ri­ence else­where in Asia, a suc­cess­ful dig­i­tal full bank in Sin­ga­pore might se­cure a mar­ket share of only 2 per cent to 4 per cent in five years.</p>
    <p>Shares of Alibaba – par­ent of the Ant Group that won a dig­i­tal whole­sale bank­ing li­cence – did not show much of a re­sponse to the news.</p>
    <p>The stock rose 0.6 per cent last Fri­day in Hong Kong, but fell more than 2 per cent yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Shares of Sin­ga­pore-listed iFast Corp plunged as much as 34 per cent yes­ter­day, the most on record, af­ter it failed to win a li­cence.</p>
    <p>An­other failed con­tender, Hong Kong-listed Razer, fell as much as 12 per cent.</p>
    <p>Mr Umair Hameed, part­ner for fi­nan­cial ser­vices ad­vi­sory at KPMG in Sin­ga­pore, said tech­nol­ogy-driven chal­lengers are in­creas­ingly dis­rupt­ing the business mod­els of in­dus­try lead­ers world­wide. He said dig­i­tal banks’ big­gest ad­van­tage is that they are un­bur­dened by tra­di­tional banks’ legacy sys­tems in pro­cesses, skills and in­fra­struc­ture.</p>
