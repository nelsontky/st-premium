    <p>Co­me­dian Nigel Ng has be­come a huge YouTube sen­sa­tion with his par­ody of a Malaysian Chi­nese un­cle. The 29-year-old Kuala Lumpur na­tive gave up his data sci­en­tist job to be­come a co­me­dian in Lon­don, with a reper­toire that plays on his Chi­nese up­bring­ing, stereo­typ­i­cal Asian at­ti­tudes and prac­tices.</p>
    <p>How did a co­me­dian in Bri­tain be­come a huge YouTube sen­sa­tion with his par­ody of a Malaysian Chi­nese un­cle with an Ah Beng ac­cent?</p>
    <p>With one lucky strike, that is how. By now, you might have watched Nigel Ng’s “Un­cle Roger Dis­gusted By This Egg Fried Rice Video (BBC Food)” on YouTube, which has racked up more than 14.5 mil­lion views with more than 50,800 com­ments.</p>
    <p>Ng, 29, is a Malaysian from Kuala Lumpur who gave up his job as a data sci­en­tist to be­come a full-time stand-up co­me­dian in Lon­don. His reper­toire plays, to great ef­fect, on his Chi­nese up­bring­ing as well as stereo­typ­i­cal Asian at­ti­tudes and prac­tices.</p>
    <p>He is not the first co­me­dian to draw on his eth­nic­ity as laugh fod­der, how­ever. Lilly Singh, a Canadian come­di­enne, be­came one of the world’s high­est-paid YouTube stars with her hu­mor­ous takes on her Pun­jabi heritage, cul­tural quirks and fam­ily re­la­tion­ships, among other topics.</p>
    <p>Ng has a long way to catch up with Lilly, who has 14 mil­lion sub­scribers, more than three bil­lion video views and her own tele­vi­sion talk show. But the way his sub­scriber base jumped from 9,000 to 903,000 in six weeks fol­low­ing his “dis­gusted” video, which he posted on July 8, can be de­scribed only as phe­nom­e­nal. That fig­ure has since jumped to 1.44 mil­lion sub­scribers.</p>
    <p>Ng ac­knowl­edges as much in an in­ter­view with South China Morn­ing Post: “As co­me­di­ans, we work our whole lives hop­ing for a break. And I feel I am lucky enough to get one.”</p>
    <p>And what a break it has been. For that, Ng has his Un­cle Roger per­sona to thank. He has ex­plained that “If you grew up in Asia, you would recog­nise this kind of archetype. This sassy, con­de­scend­ing un­cle who com­plains about ev­ery­thing, but ul­ti­mately is funny and nice”.</p>
    <p>While the name was cre­ated by his co-host Eve­lyn Mok on the com­edy pod­cast Rice To Meet You, Ng says ev­ery­thing else was his: the ac­cent, at­ti­tude and man­ner­isms.</p>
    <p>All that co­a­lesced per­fectly in his Un­cle Roger’s re­ac­tion to a cook­ing video on how to make egg fried rice by BBC Food pre­sen­ter Her­sha Pa­tel.</p>
    <p>Pa­tel was roundly ridiculed by Ng for the way she cooked what is one of the most beloved dishes of the Chi­nese. She shocked Ng and, sub­se­quently, mil­lions of view­ers on how she boiled, strained and then ran tap wa­ter over her rice. As Ng com­i­cally de­clared: “R.I.P., rice”.</p>
    <p>Not only that, Ng man­aged to find fault with al­most ev­ery step of the recipe and de­cried Pa­tel’s fail­ure to use MSG – “the king of flavour” (Aji­nomoto should love him) – and her use of a me­tal spoon on a non-stick saucepan, an act Ng said his mother would have dis­owned him for if he had done the same.</p>
    <p>Pa­tel, who came un­der global roast­ing, later claimed she was merely fol­low­ing the recipe given to her by the BBC and in­sisted she knew how to boil rice the “cor­rect” Asian way.</p>
    <p>What­ever the truth, Ng’s dis­gusted re­ac­tion struck a chord with rice-lov­ing peo­ple ev­ery­where.</p>
    <p>It proved be­yond a doubt just how univer­sal the grain is with the near con­sen­sus on how to cook it, which is cer­tainly not the BBC way.</p>
    <p>Pa­tel turned out to be a good sport, tak­ing the crit­i­cism in her stride. In­deed, while she was mocked, it was gen­er­ally done in good hu­mour.</p>
    <p>Malaysian co­me­di­ans have suc­cess­fully and af­fec­tion­ately par­o­died many Malaysian ways of speak­ing and what Ng’s Un­cle Roger has done is to bring one of those ac­cents to the world.</p>
    <p>It is what Malaysians would call the Chi­na­man way of talk­ing, in which plu­rals do not ex­ist, cer­tain words are man­gled and the Can­tonese “haiya” is lib­er­ally used to de­note dis­ap­point­ment, dis­gust and dis­plea­sure.</p>
    <p>Fas­ci­nated and amused fans around the world have asked if that is Un­cle Roger’s “real way of talk­ing”, and it has in­spired a YouTu­ber by the name of Nina, a Chi­nese woman who has been liv­ing in the United States the past six years, to take on the fic­ti­tious per­sona of Un­cle Roger’s ex-wife, Aunty He­len.</p>
    <p>But she sounds forced and not au­then­tic.</p>
    <p>Un­cle Roger may not be a classy char­ac­ter: His usual pose of sit­ting with one foot on the chair is not good Chi­nese man­ners. He is much like the opin­ion­ated, ob­nox­ious but still lov­able Archie Bunker from the 1970s iconic US sit­com All In The Fam­ily.</p>
    <p>Al­though Ng/Un­cle Roger lives in Bri­tain (in sub­se­quent videos, he makes peace with Pa­tel and vis­its Lon­don’s Chi­na­town with her), Ng iden­ti­fies as Malaysian. He was quick to cor­rect a fel­low co­me­dian who had mis­taken him for a Korean in a show.</p>
    <p>Ng is on a roll and has be­come the unof­fi­cial YouTube rice critic, fried or oth­er­wise. As Nigel Ng, he has be­rated the West for ru­in­ing rice and, as Un­cle Roger, roasted Jamie Oliver for his olive oil and tofu recipe, but praised Gordon Ram­say’s spicy In­done­sian nasi goreng ver­sion.</p>
    <p>His fans keep ask­ing for more of the same, but he has nailed bit­ingly funny mono­logues on other topics too. Thus far, he has shown keen wit, as­tute ob­ser­va­tion, deft use of stereo­types, risque sauci­ness and charm­ing self-dep­re­ca­tion.</p>
    <p>He and Pa­tel are col­lab­o­rat­ing as former neme­ses turned best bud­dies.</p>
