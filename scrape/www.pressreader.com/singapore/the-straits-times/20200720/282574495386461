    <p>Dur­ing these months of lock­down, I’ve be­come very con­fused by the na­ture of time. I used to see time as some­thing to be bat­tled against. I used to say, I wish I could stop the world and get off. Lo and be­hold, my wish has come true!</p>
    <p>The world has been stopped by Covid-19, and for many of us in lock­down, time has sud­denly be­come our own, to make of it what we will.</p>
    <p>Com­ing face to face with time has been one of the most cu­ri­ous el­e­ments of this cu­ri­ous pe­riod in the af­fairs of man. Our daily life is struc­tured by time, from get­ting up in the morn­ing to set­ting the alarm clock at night. Life is tied to Clock Time – rou­tines, ap­point­ments, sched­ules, dead­lines. When we are not liv­ing in Clock Time, we are liv­ing in Psy­cho­log­i­cal Time, dwelling on prob­lems, pro­ject­ing thoughts into the past or fu­ture and liv­ing there, trapped in the va­garies of our mind.</p>
    <p>Con­fined by lock­down, the pan­demic has al­tered our re­la­tion­ship to time, forc­ing us to live less in Clock Time and more in Psy­cho­log­i­cal Time. The world news, nowa­days un­re­lent­ingly ter­ri­fy­ing, is re­layed to us daily in Clock Time on the tele­vi­sion and our mo­bile de­vices, and throws us into the dark­est reaches of Psy­cho­log­i­cal Time.</p>
    <p>The elas­tic­ity of time has also made it­self known to us in new ways. There are those whose work­load has dou­bled in lock­down. Shut up with their chil­dren, they must man­age ca­reers from home while school­ing young­sters and cook­ing an un­prece­dented three meals a day. For these in­di­vid­u­als, time has shrunk to its stub­bornest mod­icum, re­fus­ing to give an inch. Then there are those who led worka­holic of­fice lives, who played and par­tied and trav­elled abun­dantly, whose homes were a place to sleep be­tween ac­tiv­i­ties. For them, time now lays un­nerv­ingly loose about them, scream­ing out to be filled.</p>
    <p>Those whose work­load has dou­bled, although some­what fraz­zled, are man­ag­ing ad­mirably, or­gan­is­ing the day to fit the hours with clock­work pre­ci­sion. Many worka­holics, who sud­denly find them­selves with lit­tle to do, are fill­ing the day at­tend­ing Zoom meet­ings and par­ties, watch­ing Net­flix, par­tic­u­larly ad­dic­tive K-dra­mas, trav­el­ling dig­i­tally to new places, edit­ing their pho­to­graphs or vir­tu­ally tour­ing the world’s great mu­se­ums and gal­leries.</p>
    <p>From their so­fas the more serious can even join the Dalai Lama for an on­line teach­ing or hear the Pope speak in real time from St Peter’s Square. In what­ever way we are fill­ing our over­loaded or un­der­loaded pan­demic day, ev­ery­one is say­ing how quickly time passes. Time, an el­e­ment we pre­vi­ously gave lit­tle thought to, must now be re­spect­fully re-eval­u­ated.</p>
    <p>We are very late in get­ting to grips with time. Al­bert Ein­stein faced the prob­lem long be­fore Covid-19 and found it in­fin­itely more pe­cu­liar than any­one imag­ined. Time, Ein­stein found, is an il­lu­sion. As his the­ory of rel­a­tiv­ity ex­plained, it can vary for dif­fer­ent ob­servers de­pend­ing on the speed by which they jour­ney through space. It can also slow down or speed up de­pend­ing on how fast you move in re­la­tion to some­thing else and, even more sly, it can bend and turn cor­ners. This bend­ing of space-time causes ob­jects to move on a curved path, and this cur­va­ture of space is what we call grav­ity. Clocks gain 38 mi­crosec­onds a day in outer space. An astro­naut re­turn­ing to Earth after a space sta­tion stay will be very slightly younger than an iden­ti­cal twin who has re­mained on Earth. If you could live at the right place in space, time would for­get you and you would not age at all.</p>
    <p>In 1955 the Bri­tish his­to­rian Cyril North­cote Parkin­son be­came fa­mous for an ar­ti­cle about the me­chan­ics of time, Parkin­son’s Law. Parkin­son had worked for the Bri­tish civil ser­vice and knew the labyrinthi­an ways of bu­reau­cracy where, he stated, work­ing harder, not smarter is all that is ap­pre­ci­ated.</p>
    <p>Parkin­son’s Law af­firms that work ex­pands to fill the time avail­able for its com­ple­tion. In other words, time is elas­tic. If you give your­self a week to com­plete a two-hour task, then some­how, that task will stretch to fill that week. The task may in­crease in its com­plex­ity. For ex­am­ple, you may lose your spec­ta­cles or mis­lay the in­struc­tions per­tain­ing to the task or re­alise you missed break­fast and are so hun­gry you must break for an early lunch and de­lay the work. Or, the ex­tra time may be filled with the stress and ten­sion of get­ting the task done, dither­ing and need­lessly re­do­ing. What­ever way you tackle your two-hour task, it will mag­i­cally fill the week.</p>
    <p>Time also ap­pears to ex­pand or con­tract de­pend­ing on whether we are hav­ing fun or fac­ing dan­ger. Ap­par­ently, foe­tuses are aware of time and can co­or­di­nate their cir­ca­dian ac­tiv­ity, but peo­ple shut away from light soon lose all sense of time; a week can seem like a day, a day like a week.</p>
    <p>We are never re­ally trust­ing of time. We talk of find­ing it and los­ing it, of sav­ing it and spend­ing it. We de­scribe it as fly­ing or creep­ing, run­ning out or away from us, or sim­ply stand­ing still. Ac­cord­ing to the writer Jorge Luis Borges, “Time is a river which sweeps me along, but I am the river…” In what­ever way we de­scribe time, it is al­ways with a note of ap­pre­hen­sion be­cause we know, eter­nal as time is, some­where up ahead it must with­out any doubt end for us.</p>
    <p>Ein­stein’s premise that time is an il­lu­sion is but the echo­ing of those an­cient truths mys­tics and prophets have al­ways told us. We ap­proach time wrongly, di­min­ish­ing it to a clock­face of me­chan­i­cal prop­er­ties. In­stead, let us recog­nise time for the in­vis­i­ble mys­tery that it is. It is the ether within which we live and move and have our be­ing. Time is the cru­cible of con­scious­ness it­self, and our ex­pe­ri­ence of be­ing hu­man un­folds within it.</p>
    <p>That it in­vis­i­bly ex­pands and con­tracts, stands still and turns cor­ners and will con­tinue through eter­nity, not even notic­ing that we have passed and gone, only adds to its all-en­com­pass­ing pri­macy. The only place that is out of time, where life can be lived with equi­lib­rium, no mat­ter what it con­tains, is the present mo­ment. Spir­i­tual teacher and au­thor Eck­hart Tolle says: “Life is now. There was never a time when your life was not now, nor will there ever be.”</p>
    <p>At the end of the evening, as you pull down the blind on an­other day, won­der­ing where the hours have gone do­ing so lit­tle or so much, it might be well to give a thought to the mys­tery and magic of time.</p>
