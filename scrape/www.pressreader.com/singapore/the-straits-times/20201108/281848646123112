    <p>NOT VI­ABLE</p>
    <p>Live per­for­mances in Sin­ga­pore may be start­ing to see small au­di­ences, but a re­turn to pre-pan­demic lev­els for the con­cert in­dus­try is still a long way away.</p>
    <p>Cur­rently, only two zones of 50 au­di­ence mem­bers each are al­lowed at per­for­mances in se­lected in­door live venues. Not all venues can have live shows.</p>
    <p>At its height, ma­jor music events such as last year’s F1 con­certs, which fea­tured global pop and rock stars such as Amer­i­can band Red Hot Chili Pep­pers, pulled in 65,000 peo­ple a night at the Padang.</p>
    <p>The con­cert in­dus­try here has been dec­i­mated by the Covid-19 pan­demic, said Mr Michael Roche, man­ag­ing di­rec­tor of Lush­ing­ton En­ter­tain­ments, which has or­gan­ised con­certs since 1990.</p>
    <p>“With the un­cer­tainty of travel re­stric­tions, the costs of bring­ing in in­ter­na­tional artists and re­quire­ments on much-re­duced ca­pac­i­ties, it just makes it fi­nan­cially un­work­able,” he said.</p>
    <p>With­out any in­come from con­certs, Lush­ing­ton has paid staff salaries with help from the gov­ern­ment Jobs Sup­port Scheme.</p>
    <p>“I have al­ways kept full-time staff and over­heads to an ab­so­lute min­i­mum and we all mul­ti­task over a num­ber of com­pa­nies and port­fo­lios,” said Mr Roche, who is also the ex­ec­u­tive di­rec­tor of Sin­ga­pore GP. His staff also work for other com­pa­nies such as Blue Sky Events, which or­gan­ises the an­nual Christ­mas Won­der­land fair.</p>
    <p>Com­pa­nies in­volved in the live con­cert in­dus­try are ei­ther piv­ot­ing to new ven­tures, such as live stream­ing, or are de­pend­ing on other busi­nesses such as tal­ent man­age­ment.</p>
    <p>Live music com­pany Ebenex, which pro­vides equip­ment for con­certs and runs two live music venues and a gui­tar shop, was one of those tak­ing their shows on­line.</p>
    <p>Man­ag­ing di­rec­tor David Ebenezer Toh teamed up with Tim­bre Group co-founder Danny Loong and launched #Keep­mu­si­calive, a 24-episode on­line gig se­ries fea­tur­ing home-grown mu­si­cians, which re­ceived over 450,000 views.</p>
    <p>The two live venues were con­verted into me­dia pro­duc­tion stu­dios. The com­pany also moved to a cheaper ware­house unit and sold off older and un­wanted equip­ment to raise funds.</p>
    <p>Said Mr Toh: “It was a steep learn­ing curve ini­tially as we had to learn film-mak­ing tech­niques, IT, net­work­ing and game-de­sign el­e­ments to trans­late the ‘live’ ex­pe­ri­ence to the ‘vir­tual’ space as best as we could.”</p>
    <p>From last Fri­day to to­day, the Es­planade has been hold­ing a hy­brid edi­tion of its Bay­beats al­ter­na­tive music fes­ti­val.</p>
    <p>The gigs were live-streamed, but se­lect per­for­mances in the Es­planade Theatre had a small num­ber of so­cially dis­tanced peo­ple in the au­di­ence who had bought tick­ets for a back­stage tour.</p>
    <p>Ms Amy Ho, head of music at Es­planade, said her team had to be cre­ative in tak­ing the arts to peo­ple in a mean­ing­ful and safe way.</p>
    <p>She noted: “When we started plan­ning for this edi­tion of Bay­beats more than two months ago, we were un­sure of how the Covid-19 sit­u­a­tion would evolve, but we also knew that the com­mu­nity has missed be­ing able to en­joy live gigs these past few months.</p>
    <p>“So we planned for a hy­brid fes­ti­val com­pris­ing both live and dig­i­tal ex­pe­ri­ences.”</p>
    <p>Live-stream gigs are also here to stay, she added, as tak­ing their pro­grammes on­line en­abled the Es­planade to reach more au­di­ences be­yond the venue’s phys­i­cal lim­its.</p>
    <p>OTHER VEN­TURES</p>
    <p>Con­cert pro­mot­ers here are of­ten in­volved in other en­ter­tain­men­tre­lated busi­nesses, and are now fo­cus­ing on their other ven­tures.</p>
    <p>Last month, con­cert pro­moter 24Owls launched a tick­eted on­line gig se­ries, Flock At The Nest, which also de­liv­ered cock­tails or mock­tails to view­ers who or­dered them so they could en­joy a drink while watch­ing the show.</p>
    <p>The staff also kept busy with projects by 24Owls’ par­ent com­pany, 19Six­tyFive, which works with brands and artists.</p>
    <p>Still, Ms Marcia Tan, founder of both com­pa­nies, hopes to get au­di­ences back to live con­certs.</p>
    <p>“I do not wish for live streams to take over in-per­son per­for­mances.</p>
    <p>“Just as you can’t have a sen­sory ex­pe­ri­ence from merely watch­ing some­thing on­screen, you won’t be able to repli­cate the thrill of a pal­pa­ble live ex­pe­ri­ence with­out be­ing at the venue.</p>
    <p>“Cul­ture is a way of life and, in live music per­for­mances, we fun­da­men­tally need hu­man pres­ence, com­mu­nity in­ter­ac­tion and so­cial ac­tiv­ity.</p>
    <p>“How can we achieve that with­out be­ing phys­i­cally en­gaged?”</p>
    <p>Mr James Kang, di­rec­tor of con­cert or­gan­iser Mode Pro­duc­tions, said that live streams can bring in big bucks only if the artists are mas­sively pop­u­lar, cit­ing South Korean group BTS’ on­line con­certs.</p>
    <p>Last month, the K-pop stars broke records by draw­ing more than one mil­lion view­ers to their tick­eted, two-day on­line con­cert.</p>
    <p>Tick­ets started at 49,500 won (S$59.50). Suc­cess­ful gigs like that are the ex­cep­tion rather than the rule, Mr Kang added.</p>
    <p>“Most of the time, the num­bers don’t make sense be­cause peo­ple gen­er­ally are not will­ing to pay for vir­tual events,” he said.</p>
    <p>“For con­cert or­gan­is­ers like us, we are sell­ing an ex­pe­ri­ence, not a prod­uct.</p>
    <p>It is dif­fer­ent from other busi­nesses like re­tail­ers, where you can just go vir­tual and sell your prod­ucts on­line overnight.</p>
    <p>“So it’s def­i­nitely very, very tough for us.”</p>
    <p>Like Ms Tan, Mr Kang is now fo­cus­ing on his other busi­ness, Mode En­ter­tain­ment, an artist man­age­ment and mar­ket­ing com­pany.</p>
    <p>Some com­pa­nies have been mostly spared, such as Un­usual En­ter­tain­ment, which staged home­grown star JJ Lin’s two-night per­for­mance at the Na­tional Sta­dium last year.</p>
    <p>Chief ex­ec­u­tive Les­lie Ong said: “We have been lucky in a way be­cause we had an ex­tremely busy last quar­ter of 2019.</p>
    <p>“There­fore we had planned for a fairly quiet first quar­ter of 2020 when Covid-19 struck.”</p>
    <p>The com­pany has since worked with over­seas part­ners and has co­p­re­sented con­certs in Tai­wan.</p>
    <p>It also has plans to stage on­line con­certs and set up a tick­et­ing plat­form.</p>
    <p>When big­ger au­di­ences are al­lowed at con­certs, at­ten­dees will have to get used to the new norm of wear­ing masks, safe dis­tanc­ing and lim­ited ca­pac­ity, said a spokesman for con­cert or­gan­iser CK Star En­ter­tain­ment.</p>
    <p>The com­pany, which or­gan­ised con­certs on an al­most monthly ba­sis last year, had to put on hold all its con­certs planned for this year.</p>
    <p>The down­side of a re­duced crowd is that au­di­ences will end up pay­ing more for tick­ets.</p>
    <p>And if mea­sures such as swab tests at con­certs are made manda­tory, the cost of test­ing is likely to be passed on to con­cert­go­ers.</p>
    <p>“Our big­gest dilemma is the trade-off be­tween en­sur­ing safe dis­tanc­ing, which im­pacts the seat­ing ca­pac­ity of the venue, and af­ford­able ticket prices for our con­cert­go­ers,” said the spokesman.</p>
    <p>With the un­cer­tainty of travel re­stric­tions, the costs of bring­ing in in­ter­na­tional artists and re­quire­ments on much-re­duced ca­pac­i­ties, it just makes it fi­nan­cially un­work­able.</p>
    <p>MR MICHAEL ROCHE, man­ag­ing di­rec­tor of Lush­ing­ton En­ter­tain­ments, which has been or­gan­is­ing con­certs since 1990.</p>
    <p>CAN’T REPLI­CATE THRILL</p>
    <p>I do not wish for live streams to take over in-per­son per­for­mances. Just as you can’t have a sen­sory ex­pe­ri­ence from merely watch­ing some­thing on­screen, you won’t be able to repli­cate the thrill of a pal­pa­ble live ex­pe­ri­ence with­out be­ing at the venue.</p>
    <p>MS MARCIA TAN, founder of 24Owls and 19Six­tyFive, which are in­volved in con­certs and music-re­lated events.</p>
    <p>SELL­ING EX­PE­RI­ENCE</p>
    <p>For con­cert or­gan­is­ers like us, we are sell­ing an ex­pe­ri­ence, not a prod­uct. It is dif­fer­ent from other busi­nesses like re­tail­ers, where you can just go vir­tual and sell your prod­ucts on­line overnight. So it’s def­i­nitely very, very tough for us.”</p>
    <p>MR JAMES KANG, di­rec­tor of con­cert or­gan­iser Mode Pro­duc­tions.</p>
    <p>In the past six months or so, the grim reaper has stalked my fam­ily’s con­ver­sa­tions.</p>
    <p>My 51/ 2- year-old daugh­ter has been ask­ing about the end as we range over top­ics such as our an­ces­tors, ill­nesses and ac­ci­dents.</p>
    <p>It is not a mor­bid in­ter­est – she has not yet learnt that death and dy­ing could be a dark sub­ject – but sim­ply a nat­u­ral cu­rios­ity about a nat­u­ral phe­nom­e­non.</p>
    <p>Yet, she in­stinc­tively grasped that it would in­volve loss and long­ing.</p>
    <p>In bed one night, she sud­denly asked: “Mama, will you stay with me for­ever? You won’t die un­til I die, right?”</p>
    <p>With­out miss­ing a beat, she added – rather op­por­tunis­ti­cally: “We can die to­gether. Sophia will take care of Yui as she will be old enough.”</p>
    <p>I guess I should feel re­as­sured that she made con­tin­gency plans for Yui, her tod­dler sis­ter and tor­men­tor. Sophia is their re­spon­si­ble four-year-old friend.</p>
    <p>Over the sub­se­quent months, as we con­tin­ued talk­ing more about death in what I hoped was a calm and mat­ter-of-fact fash­ion, my older child’s mus­ings took on the ve­neer of a fact-find­ing ex­pe­di­tion as she tried to make sense of the world around her.</p>
    <p>In­trigued by the idea of bod­ies in soil, she asked to visit the his­toric Mus­lim ceme­tery, Kubur Kas­sim, in Siglap Road, which we pass each time we visit her grand­par­ents, and where com­mu­nity lead­ers such as Che Lem­bek Ab­din, the head­mistress of Kam­pong Glam Girls’ School dur­ing World War II, are laid to rest.</p>
    <p>She pored over the pic­tures of a book, The First Hu­mans, pub­lished by the Amer­i­can Mu­seum of Nat­u­ral His­tory and a gift from a col­league, and was ar­rested by an im­age of the ex­ca­vated re­mains of chil­dren in Palae­olithic-pe­riod Italy, and the shells they were buried with to mark their sta­tus.</p>
    <p>“When I die, will you bury me with my jew­ellery and this dress, my favourite dress?” was her im­me­di­ate re­ac­tion.</p>
    <p>Last week, my hus­band sketched out for her his ver­sion of the food cy­cle.</p>
    <p>A tree drops its fruit. A fly feasts on it, be­fore be­ing eaten up by a spi­der. A bird gob­bles up the spi­der, and dies, pre­sum­ably of nat­u­ral causes. The dead bird de­com­poses, and the tree draws strength from the fer­tilised soil.</p>
    <p>With­out death, after all, there would be no re­newal or re­birth.</p>
    <p>A YEAR OF DEATHS</p>
    <p>It has been a year of pass­ings and end­ings.</p>
    <p>Around the world, 1.21 mil­lion peo­ple have died of Covid-19. In Sin­ga­pore, the count stands at 28.</p>
    <p>Then, there are con­clu­sions of other sorts.</p>
    <p>There has been the col­lapse of many com­pa­nies, in in­dus­tries pum­melled by a pan­demic that for­bids travel and so­cial in­ter­ac­tions. Busi­nesses in the United States, for in­stance, big and small, are suc­cumb­ing to the wounds in­flicted, rang­ing from car rental gi­ant Hertz to re­tailer J.</p>
    <p>Crew to Ch­e­sa­peake En­ergy, once the sec­ond-largest nat­u­ral gas com­pany in the US.</p>
    <p>Many other in­dus­tries not di­rectly in the fir­ing line are grop­ing for a new way for­ward as well, given how the need to change in re­sponse to chal­lenges brought about by pre-Covid-19 dis­rup­tion has been ac­cel­er­ated.</p>
    <p>There is also the demise of dreams and plans, given the long string of lay­offs and re­scinded job of­fers.</p>
    <p>Here at home, many felt for the Sin­ga­pore Air­lines cadet pilots and cabin crew trainees who made it through the gru­elling re­cruit­ment rounds, but who will not – at least in the near fu­ture – get to slip on their uni­forms and take to the skies.</p>
    <p>Such losses af­fect not just the com­pa­nies’ share­hold­ers, em­ploy­ees and their fam­i­lies.</p>
    <p>A world in which stal­warts and vet­er­ans are sud­denly chopped down is also dis­con­cert­ing for those who may not be di­rectly af­fected, but feel their loss nonethe­less.</p>
    <p>Last week’s news of Robin­sons’ demise, for in­stance, should not have been star­tling at all. The writ­ing has been on the wall, as re­tail moves in­ex­orably out of brick-and-mor­tar depart­ment stores to e-com­merce plat­forms.</p>
    <p>If Lazada was not the fa­tal blow, Covid-19 pro­vided the coup de grace.</p>
    <p>Still, when the an­nounce­ment came, it was a shock for many. For the bet­ter half of two cen­turies, Robin­sons fur­nished many a bed­room and kitchen in mid­dle class Sin­ga­pore. From non-stick pans to oys­ter knives to coil spring mat­tresses, it of­fered a taste­ful se­lec­tion of im­ported goods for any as­pir­ing mis­tress or master of the house.</p>
    <p>In its 162-year life, the store faced down Ja­panese bombs dur­ing World War II, an in­ferno in 1972 which killed nine peo­ple, and a quar­tet of knife-wield­ing rob­bers in 1990 who slashed its cashier and clerk. But in the end, Robin­sons’ big­gest threat was its own cus­tomers, who changed the way they shop.</p>
    <p>Like the bat­tle-hard­ened trooper it is, it fought against the trend. It went up­mar­ket (Ma­rina Bay Sands), heart­land (Jem) and trendy (Heeren). It had first its own e-com­merce web­site and then a dig­i­tal shop on Lazada’s LazMall plat­form.</p>
    <p>Noth­ing could save it.</p>
    <p>How many mid­dle-aged work­ers or other busi­nesses in the throes of dis­rup­tion must have felt a twinge of em­pa­thy – and per­haps a loom­ing dread?</p>
    <p>Some­times, ob­so­les­cence may be star­ing one in the face, but all the fran­tic scram­bling to up­grade or pivot can still go nowhere.</p>
    <p>In its 162-year life, the store faced down Ja­panese bombs dur­ing World War II, an in­ferno in 1972 which killed nine peo­ple, and a quar­tet of knife-wield­ing rob­bers in 1990 who slashed its cashier and clerk. But in the end, Robin­sons’ big­gest threat was its own cus­tomers, who changed the way they shop.</p>
    <p>LIFE AFTER DEATH</p>
    <p>So if the end is in­evitable, what of re­newal and re­birth?</p>
    <p>For many work­ers in Sin­ga­pore, this is of­ten couched in ex­hor­ta­tions to reskill, and to make over them­selves.</p>
    <p>It comes in the form of a letter from Skill­sFu­ture with $1,500 of cred­its and the faint prom­ise it holds of a new pro­duc­tive life – if you will make the ef­fort.</p>
    <p>For bosses steer­ing be­lea­guered or­gan­i­sa­tions, it is about fig­ur­ing out what the new op­por­tu­ni­ties on the hori­zon are – slim though they may be in this cli­mate – and start­ing over again.</p>
    <p>But with the loss of jobs or in­comes or the agency to pro­tect one’s busi­ness and col­leagues, comes also a deeper loss of iden­tity and self-worth.</p>
    <p>This is much harder to come to terms with, and it could take quite a while.</p>
    <p>As my child passes through this sea­son where she is com­ing to grips with a cer­tain loss of in­no­cence, it is the same for many oth­ers out there. Whether we like it or not, death and loss stalk us all the time and we need to learn to dis­cover hope in the dark­ness.</p>
    <p>Last week, my daugh­ter scanned the pho­tos of The Sun­day Times’ Life cover story. It was about how more mil­len­nial women are break­ing the gen­er­a­tions-old stigma sur­round­ing mis­car­riages and be­com­ing more open about shar­ing about the loss of ba­bies in utero.</p>
    <p>“What hap­pened to them, mama?” my daugh­ter asked, point­ing to the pho­to­graphs of the moth­ers in­ter­viewed.</p>
    <p>Their ba­bies died, I told her.</p>
    <p>And then I told her about the mis­car­riages I had, be­fore she came along. And how with­out those deaths, I would not have had her, the life that was given to me.</p>
    <p>As my child passes through this sea­son where she is com­ing to grips with a cer­tain loss of in­no­cence, it is the same for many oth­ers out there. Whether we like it or not, death and loss stalk us all the time and we need to learn to dis­cover hope in the dark­ness.</p>
