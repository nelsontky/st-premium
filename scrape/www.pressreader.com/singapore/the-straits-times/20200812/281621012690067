    <p>The pan­demic and cir­cuit breaker mea­sures this year low­ered Sin­ga­pore’s gross do­mes­tic prod­uct (GDP) by $11 bil­lion and led to a spike in un­em­ploy­ment – but both could have been higher if not for the four rounds of Bud­get sup­port mea­sures.</p>
    <p>These and other find­ings were pub­lished in a fea­ture ar­ti­cle by the Trade and In­dus­try and Fi­nance min­istries yes­ter­day, in con­junc­tion with the re­lease of es­ti­mates that said Sin­ga­pore’s GDP will shrink by 5 per cent to 7 per cent this year.</p>
    <p>“The cir­cuit breaker mea­sures, which were nec­es­sary to re­duce the com­mu­nity spread of Covid-19 and save lives, had a neg­a­tive im­pact on the econ­omy,” said the ar­ti­cle, which was writ­ten with in­put from the Mone­tary Au­thor­ity of Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>The mea­sures – in­clud­ing the clo­sure of work­places and travel curbs – took ef­fect on April 7, and were tight­ened two weeks later.</p>
    <p>The wide­spread clo­sures – and sub­se­quent ex­ten­sion of the cir­cuit breaker to June 1 – shaved $11 bil­lion, or 2.2 per cent, off Sin­ga­pore’s an­nual real GDP, said the min­istry an­a­lysts.</p>
    <p>They ex­plained that the num­ber was de­rived from the es­ti­mated value-add lost due to firms’ in­abil­ity to op­er­ate at their phys­i­cal work­places dur­ing this pe­riod.</p>
    <p>It does not in­clude sec­tor-spe­cific re­stric­tions that re­mained in place af­ter June 1, such as the later re­sump­tion of re­tail ac­tiv­ity at phys­i­cal out­lets and din­ing-in ser­vice on June 19, as well as de­lays in the restart of con­struc­tion and marine and off­shore en­gi­neer­ing ac­tiv­i­ties due to the out­break in for­eign worker dor­mi­to­ries.</p>
    <p>They added that the four Bud­gets amount­ing to $93 bil­lion, or al­most 20 per cent of Sin­ga­pore’s GDP, had stemmed a fur­ther loss of 5.5 per cent in real GDP – and re­duced the in­crease in the res­i­dent un­em­ploy­ment rate by 1.7 per­cent­age points.</p>
    <p>Taken alone, the Jobs Sup­port Scheme, which sub­sidises wages to help firms re­tain lo­cal work­ers, is ex­pected to take 0.9 per­cent­age point off the res­i­dent un­em­ploy­ment rate for cit­i­zens and per­ma­nent res­i­dents this year.</p>
    <p>“This im­plies that, with­out the Bud­get mea­sures, the econ­omy could have con­tracted by a larger mag­ni­tude,” said the an­a­lysts, adding that the four Bud­gets – rolled out from Fe­bru­ary to May – have sup­ported liveli­hoods and pre­vented even more sig­nif­i­cant dis­rup­tion to in­come and cash flows.</p>
    <p>The Bud­get mea­sures in­clude fi­nanc­ing schemes and rental re­lief for firms, pro­duc­tiv­ity and IT so­lu­tion grants, wage and train­ing sup­port, cash pay­outs for the self-em­ployed, as well as so­cial as­sis­tance schemes such as the Tem­po­rary Re­lief Fund and Covid-19 Sup­port Grant.</p>
    <p>They ac­knowl­edged that these es­ti­mates do not take into ac­count the longer-term im­pact of the pan­demic, which will lead to eco­nomic scar­ring for many coun­tries.</p>
    <p>“The US and EU took six years to about a decade re­spec­tively for their labour mar­kets to re­cover to what they were like prior to the global fi­nan­cial cri­sis (in 2009),” they said. “Ef­fec­tive short-term man­age­ment, how­ever, could avoid long-term im­pair­ment.”</p>
    <p>The im­pact of the Bud­gets may also not be felt im­me­di­ately due to the eco­nomic un­cer­tainty and the grad­ual re­sump­tion of con­sump­tion and in­vest­ments, they said.</p>
    <p>But, they added, the Bud­gets con­trib­ute to the longer-term ob­jec­tive of help­ing vi­able firms stay afloat and fa­cil­i­tat­ing a quicker re­cov­ery. “Apart from these eco­nomic ben­e­fits, there will also be pos­i­tive ex­ter­nal­i­ties from the public health man­age­ment mea­sures that have been put in place to safe­guard Sin­ga­pore from Covid-19.”</p>
