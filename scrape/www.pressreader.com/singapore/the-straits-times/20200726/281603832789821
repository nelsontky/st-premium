    <p>Seven PAP fresh faces who were elected to Par­lia­ment in the gen­eral elec­tion ear­lier this month will take up new po­lit­i­cal ap­point­ments, Prime Min­is­ter Lee Hsien Loong an­nounced yes­ter­day as he re­vealed his new Cabi­net line-up.</p>
    <p>The seven are Dr Tan See Leng (Ma­rine Pa­rade GRC), Ms Gan Siow Huang (Mary­mount), Mr Alvin Tan (Tan­jong Pa­gar GRC), Mr Des­mond Tan (Pasir Ris-Pung­gol GRC), Mr Tan Kiat How (East Coast GRC), Mr Eric Chua (Tan­jong Pa­gar GRC), and Mr Mohd Fahmi Ali­man (Ma­rine Pa­rade GRC).</p>
    <p>Dr Tan, 55, will take on three port­fo­lios: Min­is­ter in the Prime Min­is­ter’s Of­fice (PMO), Sec­ond Min­is­ter for Man­power, and Sec­ond Min­is­ter for Trade and In­dus­try.</p>
    <p>The for­mer med­i­cal doc­tor who was chief ex­ec­u­tive of the Malaysian-Sin­ga­porean pri­vate health­care group IHH Health­care said he saw his ap­point­ment to the Cabi­net as an “af­fir­ma­tion for the im­por­tance of the pri­vate sec­tor”.</p>
    <p>He added that Sin­ga­pore is fac­ing a once-in-a-life­time pan­demic that will re­quire the sup­port and part­ner­ship of ev­ery­one in the coun­try.</p>
    <p>He also said that he hopes to be a bridge be­tween the Gov­ern­ment and the pri­vate sec­tor.</p>
    <p>Ms Gan, 45, a for­mer brigadier­gen­eral, will be ap­pointed Min­is­ter of State for Ed­u­ca­tion and Man­power. She said she felt hon­oured and priv­i­leged to join the Cabi­net and hoped to im­prove the lives of Sin­ga­pore­ans.</p>
    <p>Said Ms Gan: “I’ve had a lot of ex­pe­ri­ence work­ing with peo­ple from all walks of life in the SAF and also more re­cently as part of the labour move­ment.</p>
    <p>“I’ve seen how liveli­hoods could be af­fected, and gov­ern­ment poli­cies and schemes and im­ple­men­ta­tion can make a real dif­fer­ence.”</p>
    <p>Mr Des­mond Tan, 50, will be Min­is­ter of State for Home Af­fairs, and Sus­tain­abil­ity and En­vi­ron­ment, which was pre­vi­ously called the Min­istry of the En­vi­ron­ment and Wa­ter Re­sources.</p>
    <p>I have looked very hard to find peo­ple who have ex­pe­ri­ence with grass­roots op­er­a­tions, with com­mu­nity out­reach, with some pol­icy work, and also with pri­vate sec­tor ex­pe­ri­ence.</p>
    <p>Mr Chua, 41, will be ap­pointed Par­lia­men­tary Sec­re­tary to the Min­istry of Cul­ture, Com­mu­nity and Youth (MCCY), and the Min­istry of So­cial and Fam­ily De­vel­op­ment.</p>
    <p>Mr Tan Kiat How, 43, will be Min­is­ter of State for the PMO and Na­tional De­vel­op­ment.</p>
    <p>He will also be the new chair­man of gov­ern­ment feed­back unit Reach, tak­ing over from Mr Sam Tan, who has re­tired from pol­i­tics.</p>
    <p>Mr Fahmi, 47, will be­come Mayor of South East District, tak­ing over from Dr Ma­liki Os­man, who is pro­moted to full min­is­ter.</p>
    <p>These ap­point­ments will take ef­fect to­mor­row.</p>
    <p>Mr Alvin Tan, 40, will take on the role of Min­is­ter of State for MCCY and Trade and In­dus­try from Sept 1.</p>
    <p>PM Lee said the ap­point­ment of the new MPs to Cabi­net po­si­tions and pro­mot­ing ju­nior of­fice-hold­ers and back­benchers who have per­formed well are all part of ef­forts to en­sure lead­er­ship re­newal.</p>
    <p>He added that they will re­in­force his team and of­fer new ideas and per­spec­tives.</p>
    <p>Asked what qual­i­ties he looked for in the new MPs that made them suitable as po­lit­i­cal of­fice-hold­ers, he cited com­mit­ment, lead­er­ship, abil­ity and ex­pe­ri­ence.</p>
    <p>Said PM Lee: “I have looked very hard to find peo­ple who have ex­pe­ri­ence with grass­roots op­er­a­tions, with com­mu­nity out­reach, with some pol­icy work, and also with pri­vate sec­tor ex­pe­ri­ence.”</p>
    <p>He added that he has of­ten spo­ken about bring­ing in more peo­ple from the pri­vate sec­tor but has not found it easy to do so.</p>
    <p>He said: “We’re look­ing for that com­bi­na­tion and we are hop­ing that they come into this re­spon­si­bil­ity, they will grow in their job and de­velop and be­come good min­is­ters of state and min­is­ters in due course.”</p>
