    <p>It is great news that Singapore has se­cured enough Covid-19 vac­cines for ev­ery­one here, with the first vac­cines slated to ar­rive by the year end.</p>
    <p>Once there are enough vac­cines here for the en­tire pop­u­la­tion – around the third quar­ter of next year – and a suf­fi­ciently large num­ber of peo­ple have been vac­ci­nated, cur­rent mea­sures can be eased. That is some­thing to look for­ward to.</p>
    <p>But some ques­tions still linger about the vac­cines – in­clud­ing how com­pletely they will stop the spread of the pan­demic and how quickly one should rush to get vac­ci­nated.</p>
    <p>It is not so much the safety pro­file of the vac­cines. So far, that ap­pears good.</p>
    <p>But get­ting vac­ci­nated is not just about safety. There are other im­por­tant con­sid­er­a­tions as well.</p>
    <p>One is how ef­fec­tive th­ese vac­cines are. Early re­sults in­di­cate they are highly ef­fec­tive, with 95 per cent pro­tec­tion.</p>
    <p>The early vac­cines have proven to be ef­fec­tive against dis­ease. Whether they are as ef­fec­tive in pre­vent­ing in­fec­tion is still be­ing stud­ied.</p>
    <p>This means that some­one who has been vac­ci­nated is un­likely to get sick – which is very good, of course – but might still get in­fected and pass the virus on to oth­ers.</p>
    <p>Of course, this refers to the front run­ners. As more Covid-19 vac­cines are tested and reach the mar­ket, some would hope­fully not just pre­vent the dis­ease, but also pre­vent in­fec­tion in the first place. Only then can the spread of Covid-19 be stopped.</p>
    <p>An­other big ques­tion is how long the vaccine is able to con­fer pro­tec­tion against the coro­n­avirus.</p>
    <p>It is too soon to tell, since clin­i­cal tri­als for th­ese vac­cines started only a few months ago.</p>
    <p>If we are lucky, the vac­cines will con­fer life­time im­mu­nity.</p>
    <p>On the other hand, it could be like the in­fluenza vaccine with its short pro­tec­tion pe­riod of less than a year – and some­times, and for some peo­ple, it could be as short as six months.</p>
    <p>If the same ap­plies to the Covid-19 vac­cines, then by the time ev­ery­one gets vac­ci­nated by the third quar­ter of next year, it is time to start ev­ery­one on a sec­ond round of vac­ci­na­tion.</p>
    <p>So, given the low com­mu­nity spread in Singapore to­day, some might choose to wait a while be­fore get­ting vac­ci­nated.</p>
    <p>That is not ad­vis­able for peo­ple who are in the high-risk group, ei­ther be­cause they are more ex­posed to pos­si­ble in­fec­tion, such as healthcare work­ers and peo­ple do­ing swab tests, or be­cause un­der­ly­ing health con­di­tions make them more vul­ner­a­ble to se­ri­ous ill­ness should they get in­fected.</p>
    <p>For them, the ben­e­fits of early vac­ci­na­tion are sig­nif­i­cant, and they should not hang back.</p>
    <p>For oth­ers, hold­ing off for awhile might mean get­ting a bet­ter vaccine. The first to get ap­proved may not be the best.</p>
    <p>Bet­ter could mean sev­eral things – longer im­mu­nity, pro­tec­tion against in­fec­tion and not just dis­ease, or even re­quir­ing just one in­jec­tion as op­posed to two in­jec­tions 21 days apart for the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, which is cur­rently the only vaccine that has been given in­terim ap­proval for use here.</p>
    <p>On the other hand, there are no guar­an­tees that wait­ing a few months will throw up a vaccine with longer last­ing pro­tec­tion, since that is some­thing that only time will tell.</p>
    <p>And if too many peo­ple de­cide to wait, it may hold back Singapore’s vac­ci­na­tion drive – with no as­sur­ance that some­thing bet­ter is around the cor­ner.</p>
    <p>Af­ter all, get­ting vac­ci­nated is not just about self-pro­tec­tion, as Prime Min­is­ter Lee Hsien Loong men­tioned in his ad­dress yesterday.</p>
    <p>It is also about do­ing your part to keep oth­ers safe. The more peo­ple who do so, the safer ev­ery­one will be, as the virus will have fewer op­por­tu­ni­ties to spread, as the ex­perts have ex­plained.</p>
    <p>What is be­yond doubt is that should Singapore face a fur­ther wave of in­fec­tion the way that many other coun­tries have, then the sit­u­a­tion changes and it would then be im­por­tant to has­ten the vac­ci­na­tion process.</p>
    <p>But those try­ing to get vac­ci­nated just when the virus is flar­ing up again might find them­selves vul­ner­a­ble and won­der­ing why they had not acted and got a shot ear­lier.</p>
    <p>An­other ques­tion is whether peo­ple at low risk should even take the vac­cines.</p>
    <p>The an­swer is a def­i­nite yes. This ap­plies even to young, healthy adults who are at lit­tle risk of fall­ing se­verely ill, should they get in­fected.</p>
    <p>In­creas­ingly, stud­ies are show­ing that a sig­nif­i­cant num­ber of young, healthy peo­ple who got only mildly ill with Covid-19 suf­fer long-last­ing ef­fects – called long Covid – which could last weeks, months and pos­si­bly even years.</p>
    <p>Com­mon symp­toms of long Covid in­clude short­ness of breath, and joint and chest pains. Other symp­toms which last longer in­clude loss of smell or taste, prob­lems with mem­ory or con­cen­tra­tion, mus­cle pain, headache and hair loss.</p>
    <p>Vac­ci­na­tion, as with most med­i­cal pro­ce­dures, is about bal­anc­ing ben­e­fits against risk. With Covid-19, there is con­sid­er­able risk for all seg­ments of the pop­u­la­tion.</p>
    <p>So far, the risk from the early vac­cines ap­pears ex­tremely low. While it might be all right to wait a few months to let those who re­ally need it get first dibs on the jab, wait­ing too long puts you at risk, should a sec­ond wave of in­fec­tion emerge. Af­ter all, it takes time for the vaccine to build up your im­mu­nity.</p>
    <p>An­other big ques­tion is how long the vaccine is able to con­fer pro­tec­tion against the coro­n­avirus... If we are lucky, the vac­cines will con­fer life­time im­mu­nity.</p>
