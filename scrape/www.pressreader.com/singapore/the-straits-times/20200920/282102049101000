    <p>If Cris­tiano Ron­aldo is a phe­nom­e­non, per­haps he is also a trail­blazer. He be­came more pro­lific af­ter switch­ing flanks so a “shota­holic” could cut in­field from the left to let fly. Maybe the Premier League’s great­est player was ahead of his time.</p>
    <p>The most pro­lific scorer on show at Stam­ford Bridge today will be found in the dugout. Frank Lampard fin­ished his play­ing days with 303 goals. The Chelsea man­ager was the mid­fielder who outscored the strik­ers.</p>
    <p>A dif­fer­ent sort of revo­lu­tion­ary will be on the pitch. Sa­dio Mane may owe his sta­tus as the fin­isher at the van­guard of change to Jur­gen Klopp’s tac­tics, but he re­flects a rad­i­cal shift in think­ing. Sud­denly, the Mane type is ev­ery­where. The tra­di­tional left-winger is left look­ing like a di­nosaur, a species en­dan­gered by the chang­ing times.</p>
    <p>To of­fer a def­i­ni­tion, the Mane type is a right-footed left-winger, of­ten more a scorer than a sup­plier. Be­ing right-footed means he is in a po­si­tion to shoot more than cross. Nom­i­nally a winger, he is very dif­fer­ent from the touch­line­hug­ging wide men of the past. He tends to ac­tu­ally be an in­sid­e­for­ward, ex­ploit­ing the chan­nels ei­ther side of the cen­tre-backs.</p>
    <p>Look at the Premier League’s big six and each has a Mane type: Manch­ester City’s Ra­heem Ster­ling, Manch­ester United’s Mar­cus Rash­ford, Tot­ten­ham’s Son He­ung-min, Arse­nal’s Pierre-Em­er­ick Aubameyang and Chelsea’s Chris­tian Pulisic (or pos­si­bly even Timo Werner).</p>
    <p>Each is right-footed and has the po­ten­tial to get 20 goals in a sea­son; Aubameyang and Ster­ling could get 30. Each is likely to end with more goals than as­sists.</p>
    <p>Many are play­ers who, in the old days of 4-4-2, would have not been wingers but sec­ond strik­ers, the speed­ier side­kicks to big­ger men. Now, in for­ma­tions with a soli­tary cen­tre-for­ward, they take on the scorer’s du­ties.</p>
    <p>Play­ers like Mane, Ster­ling, Rash­ford and Aubameyang all use their speed to run be­yond the sup­posed spear­head of the side. Some strik­ers, es­pe­cially Roberto Firmino, can be their foil.</p>
    <p>Aubameyang and Rash­ford have spent swathes of their ca­reers in the mid­dle but can be equally po­tent com­ing from the left, per­haps be­cause there can be con­fu­sion about who picks them up.</p>
    <p>There are sta­tis­ti­cal grounds to give them a wider role. In 2017-18, when Klopp moved Mane to the left and Ster­ling tended to be City’s right-winger, none of the Premier League’s top nine scor­ers usu­ally op­er­ated on the left. In 2018-19, when Mane and Aubameyang shared the Golden Boot with Mo­hamed Salah, it was four of the top eight. Last year, it was four of the top 10.</p>
    <p>If Cris­tiano Ron­aldo is a phe­nom­e­non, per­haps he is also a trail­blazer. He be­came more pro­lific af­ter switch­ing flanks so a “shota­holic” could cut in­field from the left to let fly. Maybe the Premier League’s great­est player was ahead of his time. In the­ory, Thierry Henry led the line in Arse­nal’s 4-4-2. In fact, he of­ten veered di­ag­o­nally in from the left, pro­duc­ing the sort of right-footed shots into the op­po­site cor­ner that Aubameyang in par­tic­u­lar copies.</p>
    <p>He was the Mane type be­fore the Mane type ex­isted. And as for the old-fash­ioned left-winger? Prob­a­bly the Premier League’s most prom­i­nent reg­u­lars are Burn­ley’s Dwight McNeil and Leeds’ Jack Har­ri­son. They are fine play­ers but throw­backs com­pared to fu­tur­is­tic fin­ish­ers like Mane.</p>
