    <p>Dengue cases have fallen to their low­est level this year fol­low­ing the largest out­break in Sin­ga­pore’s his­tory.</p>
    <p>There were 228 re­ported last week, about seven times lower than the peak of 1,792 cases in July.</p>
    <p>Last week’s fig­ure, re­leased yes­ter­day by the Na­tional En­vi­ron­ment Agency (NEA), also marks the fourth suc­ces­sive week where cases have dipped be­low 300.</p>
    <p>The death toll from dengue hit a record high of 29 this year, with pos­si­ble causes of the his­toric out­break in­clud­ing the dom­i­nance of an un­usual strain and more peo­ple be­ing bit­ten by mosquitoes while stay­ing at home dur­ing the Covid-19 cir­cuit breaker.</p>
    <p>The cu­mu­la­tive num­ber of dengue cases this year – as of Thurs­day – stands at 34,844, sur­pass­ing the high of 22,170 cases in 2013.</p>
    <p>But cases have de­clined steadily from Au­gust due to ef­forts by the com­mu­nity to bring in­fec­tions un­der con­trol, said Mr Chew Ming Fai, deputy chief ex­ec­u­tive of­fi­cer and di­rec­tor-gen­eral of pub­lic health at the NEA.</p>
    <p>Th­ese in­cluded fre­quent checks by res­i­dents for po­ten­tial mos­quito breed­ing habi­tats and in­spec­tions</p>
    <p>This year’s his­toric dengue out­break was due to var­i­ous fac­tors, some Covid-19-re­lated, added the agency. It started with high weekly in­fec­tions of be­tween 300 and 400 as well as the dom­i­nance of the serotype DenV-3, an un­usual strain of the virus, in the first four months of this year.</p>
    <p>Cases spiked in May, shortly af­ter the start of the cir­cuit breaker, and peaked in July be­fore de­clin­ing steadily. As at Thurs­day, there were 57 dengue clus­ters re­ported, seven fewer than in the pre­vi­ous week. Since the be­gin­ning of the year, the agency has closed about 98 per cent of the dengue clus­ters.</p>
    <p>How­ever, the NEA cau­tioned against com­pla­cency as the weekly case num­ber re­mains rel­a­tively high for this time of the year. Although be­low last year’s fig­ure, it is three times the av­er­age num­ber of cases re­ported from 2016 to 2018.</p>
    <p>The agency at­trib­uted this to the 20 per cent in­crease in the adult Aedes ae­gypti mos­quito pop­u­la­tion last month as well as the rel­a­tively higher pro­por­tion of DenV-3 and DenV-4 serotype cases, which are less com­mon in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>As at Thurs­day, more than 230 res­i­den­tial ar­eas have high Aedes ae­gypti pop­u­la­tions with large dengue clus­ters in Tampines Street 11, Gey­lang Road, Bukit Ba­tok Street 21 and Ad­mi­ralty Drive.</p>
    <p>The NEA said it will con­tinue to con­duct in­spec­tions with its part­ners to re­move mos­quito breed­ing habi­tats. It will also fo­cus on ar­eas with high Aedes ae­gypti pop­u­la­tions as well as con­struc­tion sites and in­dus­trial premises that are close to res­i­den­tial ar­eas.</p>
    <p>MOS­QUITO-PROOF YOUR HOME BE­FORE STAY­CA­TIONS</p>
    <p>Due to the higher chance of stag­nant wa­ter pool­ing in un­used premises, the agency added that mem­bers of the pub­lic should take pre­cau­tions to pre­vent mos­quito breed­ing be­fore go­ing on stay­ca­tions.</p>
    <p>Th­ese in­clude en­sur­ing flower pots, plates and trays do not col­lect wa­ter as well as cov­er­ing toi­let bowls and floor traps. More in­for­ma­tion can be found on the NEA web­site.</p>
    <p>“Res­i­dents, es­pe­cially those re­sid­ing in dengue clus­ter ar­eas, should do their part and carry out the three pro­tec­tive ac­tions against dengue – spray in­sec­ti­cide in dark cor­ners around the house, ap­ply in­sect re­pel­lent reg­u­larly, and wear long-sleeved tops and long pants,” added the agency.</p>
