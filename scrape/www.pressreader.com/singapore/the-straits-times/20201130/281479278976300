    <p>Thirty mil­lion words – that was the eye-pop­ping fig­ure quoted in the mid-1990s by Amer­i­can re­searchers Betty Hart and Todd Ris­ley, for the word gap that de­vel­ops by age four be­tween chil­dren from low-in­come homes and their peers in higher so­cioe­co­nomic groups.</p>
    <p>The two re­searchers, who spent 2½ years study­ing chil­dren, found that a child whose par­ents are highly ed­u­cated and work­ing pro­fes­sion­als is ex­posed to roughly 1,540 more spo­ken words an hour than a typ­i­cal child on wel­fare – with some caveats throw in.</p>
    <p>Over time, they con­cluded, this word gap snow­balls so much that by age four, chil­dren in rich fam­i­lies would have heard 30 mil­lion more words than chil­dren in poorer ones.</p>
    <p>More­over, it was not just the num­ber of words, but also the type of words that var­ied. There was a sub­stan­tial gap in the com­plex­ity of words be­ing used.</p>
    <p>There were also dif­fer­ences in the kinds of words and state­ments heard. By age three, chil­dren of pro­fes­sion­als had heard 500,000 en­cour­age­ments and 80,000 dis­cour­age­ments on av­er­age. In con­trast, wel­fare chil­dren heard an av­er­age of 75,000 en­cour­ag­ing phrases and 200,000 dis­cour­ag­ing ones.</p>
    <p>Some of the fam­i­lies in the orig­i­nal study were re­cruited for a fol­low-up study when the chil­dren were in third grade. Re­searchers found that mea­sures of ac­com­plish­ment at age three were highly in­dica­tive of per­for­mance at age 10.</p>
    <p>The pro­fes­sion­als were giv­ing their chil­dren an ad­van­tage with ev­ery word they spoke, and the ad­van­tage just kept build­ing.</p>
    <p>In re­cent years, though, their find­ings have been dis­puted, with sub­se­quent stud­ies show­ing that the “word gap” may not be as wide as the two re­searchers found.</p>
    <p>But what­ever the fig­ure, most re­searchers study­ing early-child­hood lit­er­acy still main­tain that a sig­nif­i­cant lan­guage-de­vel­op­ment gap ex­ists be­tween dif­fer­ent groups of chil­dren and that there is a cor­re­la­tion be­tween poor early-lit­er­acy skills and life­long aca­demic chal­lenges.</p>
    <p>In 2008, for ex­am­ple, a Har­vard Univer­sity study found that types of con­ver­sa­tions dif­fer sig­nif­i­cantly be­tween low- and high­in­come fam­i­lies – in part due to the dif­fer­ing lev­els of ed­u­ca­tion at­tained by the par­ents in these groups.</p>
    <p>In this study, the re­searchers re­ported that higher-in­come par­ents used longer sen­tences and wider vo­cab­u­lary than the low­er­in­come ones.</p>
    <p>An­other study led by Mas­sachusetts In­sti­tute of Tech­nol­ogy cog­ni­tive sci­en­tists in 2018 found that back-and-forth con­ver­sa­tion be­tween a child and an adult is more crit­i­cal to lan­guage de­vel­op­ment than the word gap.</p>
    <p>In the study of kids aged four to six, dif­fer­ences in the num­ber of “con­ver­sa­tional turns” ac­counted for a large por­tion of the dif­fer­ences in brain phys­i­ol­ogy and lan­guage skills. This find­ing ap­plied to chil­dren re­gard­less of parental in­come or ed­u­ca­tion.</p>
    <p>The find­ings sug­gest that par­ents can have con­sid­er­able in­flu­ence over their chil­dren’s lan­guage and brain de­vel­op­ment by sim­ply en­gag­ing them in con­ver­sa­tion, the re­searchers say.</p>
    <p>“The im­por­tant thing is not just to talk to your child, but to talk with your child. It’s not just about dump­ing lan­guage into your child’s brain, but to ac­tu­ally carry on a con­ver­sa­tion with him,” said Dr Rachel Romeo, lead au­thor of the pa­per.</p>
    <p>Ex­perts say there is a spe­cific rea­son why hear­ing those words be­fore age four is so im­por­tant. Early child­hood is a crit­i­cal time in chil­dren’s brain de­vel­op­ment. More than 85 per cent of a child’s phys­i­cal brain growth oc­curs in the first three years of life.</p>
    <p>The great news is that par­ents, given the right knowl­edge and skills, can eas­ily sup­port their child’s lit­er­acy and brain de­vel­op­ment.</p>
    <p>One of t he most suc­cess­ful pro­grammes in the United States help­ing chil­dren with early-lit­er­acy de­vel­op­ment is The Thirty Mil­lion Words ini­tia­tive. The pro­gramme started by Dr Dana Suskind, a pae­di­atric sur­geon at the Univer­sity of Chicago, aims to teach par­ents and early child­hood care­givers how to nur­ture brain de­vel­op­ment through fre­quent, qual­ity com­mu­ni­ca­tion.</p>
    <p>It rec­om­mends par­ents use the “three Ts” when en­gag­ing with their young chil­dren – tune in, talk more and take turns.</p>
    <p>Tune in by pay­ing at­ten­tion to what your child is com­mu­ni­cat­ing to you. This in­cludes re­spond­ing to ba­bies’ coos and cries with spo­ken lan­guage. Get down on your child’s level. Main­tain com­fort­able eye con­tact. Show your child you are in­ter­ested in what he is say­ing.</p>
    <p>Talk more with your child us­ing de­scrip­tive words to build his vo­cab­u­lary. Think of your­self like a sports­caster, nar­rat­ing your child’s day. These do not need to be ex­cit­ing times, nec­es­sar­ily, but just adding words to the daily rou­tines. “Okay, it’s time to go gro­cery shop­ping. Let’s find our shoes. Your shoes are pink. My shoes are black.” And so on. Add “big” words to your speech. “You saw that big tree. It is hu­mon­gous.”</p>
    <p>Take turns by en­cour­ag­ing your child to re­spond to your words and ac­tions. Think of a con­ver­sa­tion with your child like play­ing a game of catch. You want the ball to go back and forth. Sup­port your child en­gag­ing in the con­ver­sa­tion. Ask open-ended ques­tions in­stead of ques­tions that have a yes or no an­swer. Re­flect back to your child what you hear him say­ing. “It sounds like re­cess was re­ally fun to­day. Tell me more about the game you played.”</p>
    <p>As Dr Suskind told The Straits Times: “Chil­dren aren’t born smart. They are made smart by their par­ents talk­ing with them.”</p>
    <p>She adds: “Thirty Mil­lion Word Gap – it’s like a head­line for a news story. It grabs the at­ten­tion of peo­ple. But be­hind it is this rich sci­ence that shows how the way par­ents in­ter­act with their chil­dren af­fects the way the chil­dren’s brains de­velop.</p>
    <p>“It is re­ally about help­ing par­ents un­der­stand the im­por­tant role they can play.”</p>
    <p>The im­por­tant thing is not just to talk to your child, but to talk with your child. It’s not just about dump­ing lan­guage into your child’s brain, but to ac­tu­ally carry on a con­ver­sa­tion with him. ’’ DR RACHEL ROMEO, lead au­thor of a study led by Mas­sachusetts In­sti­tute of Tech­nol­ogy cog­ni­tive sci­en­tists in 2018</p>
