    <p>• Ja­pan’s Naomi Osaka, Amer­i­can Me­gan Rapi­noe and Bri­ton Lewis Hamil­ton were among the ath­letes named on the 2020 “Time 100” list of the most in­flu­en­tial peo­ple in the world.</p>
    <p>The an­nual list, which is not ranked, hon­ours in­di­vid­u­als who have had the most sig­nif­i­cant im­pact on the global land­scape that year. There is no winner named.</p>
    <p>The ath­letes on the US magazine’s list have en­joyed sport­ing suc­cess as well as pro­mot­ing other causes. Ten­nis star Osaka and six-time Formula One world cham­pion driver Hamil­ton have sup­ported the Black Lives Mat­ter (BLM) move­ment, while Rapi­noe has fought for gen­der pay eq­uity in foot­ball.</p>
    <p>Osaka wore a mask bear­ing the name of a dif­fer­ent Black Amer­i­can vic­tim be­fore each match at the US Open, where she clinched the ti­tle this month, in sup­port of the fight against racial in­jus­tice in the US. Four-time Women’s Na­tional Bas­ket­ball As­so­ci­a­tion cham­pion Maya Moore, who skipped two sea­sons of her sport to fight for crim­i­nal jus­tice re­form, was also named on the list and penned Osaka’s trib­ute.</p>
    <p>“Watch­ing Naomi Osaka play the US Open, I was in­spired by how beau­ti­fully she wove her dom­i­nant ath­letic per­for­mance into an­other nar­ra­tive,” the twotime Olympic gold medal­list wrote of the only Asian ath­lete on the list. “It took hu­mil­ity and grace to point be­yond what she was do­ing, win­ning on one of the big­gest stages in her craft, at some­thing more im­por­tant.”</p>
    <p>Amer­i­can ath­letes who have used their plat­forms to back the BLM move­ment are con­tin­u­ing to find ways to pro­mote racial jus­tice and po­lice re­form. Many re­acted with dis­may to the charges filed on Wed­nes­day in the shoot­ing death of black woman Bre­onna Tay­lor.</p>
    <p>A grand jury in Louisville, Ken­tucky charged former de­tec­tive Brett Hanki­son with three counts of “wan­ton en­dan­ger­ment” over shots fired into ad­join­ing apart­ments. Nei­ther Hanki­son nor the two of­fi­cers who fired the shots that killed Tay­lor were charged in di­rect con­nec­tion with her death.</p>
    <p>Na­tional Bas­ket­ball As­so­ci­a­tion (NBA) star LeBron James, who was on last year’s Time list due to ac­tivism and char­ity, wrote on Twit­ter: “I’m dev­as­tated, hurt, sad, mad! We want Jus­tice for Bre­onna yet jus­tice was met for her neigh­bour’s apart­ment walls and not her beau­ti­ful life. Was I sur­prised at the ver­dict. Ab­so­lutely not but I was & still am hurt and heavy hearted! I send my love to Bre­onna’s mother, fam­ily and friends! I’m sorry! I’m sorry! I’m sorry!!”</p>
    <p>Other ath­letes named on the latest Time list were six-gold Olympic sprinter Allyson Felix, Su­per Bowl Most Valu­able Player (MVP) Pa­trick Ma­homes, re­tired NBA guard Dwyane Wade and back-to-back NBA MVP Giannis An­te­tok­oun­mpo.</p>
