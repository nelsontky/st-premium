    <p>•</p>
    <p>China is un­likely to ap­prove an “un­fair” deal Or­a­cle and Wal­mart said they have struck with ByteDance over the fu­ture of video-shar­ing app TikTok, the state-backed Global Times news­pa­per said in an editorial.</p>
    <p>The Amer­i­can ma­jors have said they would buy into a new, mainly United States-owned com­pany, TikTok Global, with a board of di­rec­tors com­prised mainly of Amer­i­cans, as the par­ties work to pacify the ad­min­is­tra­tion of US Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump – which had planned to ban</p>
    <p>TikTok in the coun­try on na­tional se­cu­rity grounds.</p>
    <p>In con­trast, ByteDance has said TikTok Global would be its US sub­sidiary, with 80 per cent own­er­ship.</p>
    <p>“It is clear that these ar­ti­cles (terms) ex­ten­sively show Wash­ing­ton’s bul­ly­ing style and hooli­gan logic. They hurt China’s na­tional se­cu­rity, in­ter­ests and dig­nity,” the news­pa­per said in an editorial in its English edi­tion pub­lished late on Mon­day. It was also car­ried in its Chi­nese edi­tion.</p>
    <p>“From the in­for­ma­tion pro­vided by the US, the deal is un­fair. It caters to the un­rea­son­able de­mands of Wash­ing­ton. It’s hard for us to be­lieve that Bei­jing will ap­prove such an agree­ment,” the editorial added, echo­ing com­ments on Twit­ter the same evening from the pa­per’s ed­i­tor-in-chief Hu Xi­jin.</p>
    <p>Re­spond­ing to com­ments Mr Trump made to Fox News about how TikTok Global was go­ing to be “to­tally con­trolled” by Or­a­cle, Mr Hu said yes­ter­day on Twit­ter: “Stop ex­tort­ing. You think TikTok is a com­pany from a small coun­try?</p>
    <p>“There’s no way the Chi­nese gov­ern­ment will ac­cept your de­mand. You can ruin TikTok’s US busi­ness, if US users do not ob­ject, but you can’t rob it and turn it into a US baby.”</p>
    <p>The Global Times is a tabloid pub­lished by the Peo­ple’s Daily, the of­fi­cial news­pa­per of China’s rul­ing Com­mu­nist Party, but does not speak on be­half of the party and gov­ern­ment, un­like its par­ent pub­li­ca­tion.</p>
    <p>The Chi­nese gov­ern­ment has largely re­frained from di­rectly com­ment­ing on the de­tails of the deal, al­though the For­eign Min­istry has said the US should of­fer a fair and non-dis­crim­i­na­tory en­vi­ron­ment for for­eign com­pa­nies.</p>
    <p>Reuters reported this month, cit­ing sources, that Bei­jing op­posed a forced sale of TikTok’s US op­er­a­tions by ByteDance, and would pre­fer to see the short-video app shut down in the US.</p>
    <p>The deal re­quires ap­proval from reg­u­la­tors in both Bei­jing and Wash­ing­ton, ByteDance has said.</p>
