    <p>The re­cent hard­en­ing of Amer­ica’s po­si­tion on the South China Sea (SCS) has given new mo­men­tum to geopo­lit­i­cal con­tes­ta­tion in the strate­gic wa­ter­way. The US state­ment on July 13 is sig­nif­i­cant for Wash­ing­ton’s re­jec­tion of Bei­jing’s mar­itime claims as un­law­ful, af­ter hav­ing de­clined for years to take a po­si­tion on com­pet­ing sovereignt­y claims.</p>
    <p>The new will­ing­ness by the United States to chal­lenge China on SCS dis­putes will af­fect the cal­cu­la­tions of not only South-east Asian states in­volved in ter­ri­to­rial dis­putes with China but also those of other non-claimant coun­tries as well, in­clud­ing In­dia.</p>
    <p>What hap­pens in the SCS mat­ters to In­dia, which is one of the world’s fastest grow­ing economies and the third largest en­ergy con­sumer. With the wa­ter­way be­ing a ma­jor sea cor­ri­dor for naval and com­mer­cial ship­ping, and one of the world’s most im­por­tant en­ergy trade routes, it is vi­tal for In­dia’s ac­cess to East and South-east Asia. In­dia’s grow­ing en­ergy needs also make it nec­es­sary for the emerg­ing econ­omy to ex­plore po­ten­tial sources of en­ergy – in­clud­ing oil and gas ex­pe­di­tions in the SCS.</p>
    <p>Be­ing heav­ily de­pen­dent on sea trade, any dis­rup­tions in the sea lanes of com­mu­ni­ca­tions or im­ped­i­ments to ac­cess­ing the re­gion’s mar­itime pas­sages can be detri­men­tal to In­dia’s growth.</p>
    <p>For a long time, New Delhi has maintained a strate­gic neu­tral­ity on the SCS dis­putes, tak­ing the view that they should be re­solved peace­fully through le­gal means. As a non-claimant coun­try, In­dia has ad­vo­cated for “free­dom of nav­i­ga­tion”, pro­tec­tion of “over­flight” and “unim­peded law­ful com­merce” while stress­ing that the SCS is a global com­mons. This fits well with the Modi gov­ern­ment’s Act East Pol­icy, al­low­ing it to form deeper strate­gic and eco­nomic en­gage­ments with East and South-east Asian coun­tries.</p>
    <p>Af­ter the re­lease of the US state­ment, In­dia’s Min­istry of Ex­ter­nal Af­fairs re­stated that New Delhi con­sid­ers the SCS a part of “global com­mons” and has an “abid­ing in­ter­est in peace and sta­bil­ity in the re­gion”.</p>
    <p>But will In­dia re­visit its neu­tral po­si­tion on the SCS, amid its own ris­ing ten­sions with China? What po­ten­tial fac­tors could shape this pol­icy change?</p>
    <p>Any change in In­dia’s stance on the SCS would re­quire a na­tion­al­ist and re­vi­sion­ist re­solve on its part, along with strate­gic fore­sight vis-a-vis China. Any shift would be af­fected by, among other things, the shape and di­rec­tion of Sino-In­dian re­la­tions as well as the re­sponse of other non-claimant coun­tries to the SCS dis­putes.</p>
    <p>It is note­wor­thy, for in­stance, that Prime Min­is­ter Narenda Modi has shown a will­ing­ness to ex­pand In­dia’s foot­print in the SCS, as seen in the pro­posal last Septem­ber to start a mar­itime route with Rus­sia that will tra­verse the con­tested wa­ters as it links Vladi­vos­tok to Chen­nai.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, In­dia-China ties are un­der­go­ing strate­gic con­fronta­tion, bi­lat­er­ally and re­gion­ally.</p>
    <p>While largely im­plau­si­ble be­fore, strate­gic cir­cles in In­dia post-Gal­wan Val­ley clash have be­gun con­sid­er­ing a re­vi­sion to the coun­try’s “One China” pol­icy. The bloody bor­der brawl that left 20 In­dian sol­diers dead served as a sharp re­minder to Delhi of the risks posed by In­dia’s un­re­solved bor­der dis­putes with China.</p>
    <p>In the event that In­dia does de­cide a change to its “One China” pol­icy is needed, then Delhi’s re­con­sid­er­a­tion of its cur­rent stance on SCS would be de­ci­sively linked to this change.</p>
    <p>Such a re­vi­sion would not be made lightly and would likely in­clude a re­view of In­dia’s po­si­tion on the cause of Ti­bet if China were to con­tinue its ag­gres­sive claims that threaten In­dia’s own ter­ri­to­rial in­tegrity, such as con­trol of the whole of Arunachal Pradesh state.</p>
    <p>Fur­ther­more, China’s Peo­ple’s Lib­er­a­tion Army (PLA) has played a shrewd role in re­cent years by cre­at­ing a strate­gic di­vide be­tween In­dia and its two Hi­malayan neigh­bours, Bhutan and Nepal. Through the 2017 Dok­lam in­ci­dent, the Chi­nese mil­i­tary suc­ceeded in cre­at­ing a fis­sure be­tween In­dia and Bhutan.</p>
    <p>Delhi also sees a Chi­nese hand in stok­ing anti-In­dian sen­ti­ments in Nepal’s own bor­der dis­pute with In­dia. The per­sis­tence of such ten­sions and the PLA’s re­cent ac­tions on bor­der dis­putes with In­dia are also fac­tors that could push a re­view of In­dia’s neu­tral po­si­tion, since New Delhi sees the SCS as a core is­sue for Bei­jing.</p>
    <p>In­dia could also re­visit its stance if China de­cides to en­gage with Pak­istan to cre­ate a double-front con­flict with In­dia. Bei­jing has con­sis­tently op­posed In­dia’s joint oil ex­plo­ration with Viet­nam in the SCS, as­sert­ing its “sovereignt­y” in the dis­puted re­gion by cit­ing “his­tor­i­cal” claims. How­ever, Bei­jing shrugs off Delhi’s “sovereignt­y” over Pak­istan Oc­cu­pied Kash­mir (POK), over­look­ing In­dia’s “his­tor­i­cal” claim to the re­gion.</p>
    <p>In short, In­dia’s neu­tral­ity over the SCS dis­putes could shift depend­ing on its per­cep­tion of China’s “med­dling” in its South Asian neigh­bour­hood.</p>
    <p>But events far­ther afield that im­pinge on In­dia’s eco­nomic in­ter­ests could prove piv­otal as well. If, for in­stance, the PLA de­cides to grab Tai­wan by force, the threat of war be­tween the US and China would be a ma­jor game-changer. Delhi would need to re­view its poli­cies if only be­cause 55 per cent of In­dia’s trade passes through the SCS.</p>
    <p>Bei­jing’s strate­gic goal to con­trol as much of the oil-rich seabed in SCS is an­other im­por­tant fac­tor. It af­fects In­dia be­cause of its own ex­plo­ration ef­forts with Viet­namese oil com­pa­nies. The pres­ence of In­dia’s ONGC Videsh in Viet­nam is not a new de­vel­op­ment, hav­ing started way back in 1988. If China was to repli­cate its 2019 at­tempts to stop In­dia’s oil ex­plo­ration in the SCS, a post-Gal­wan In­dia, amid mount­ing po­lit­i­cal and public pres­sure, may de­cide on a tougher re­sponse. In­dia’s re­cent de­ci­sion to ban Chi­nese apps and re­strict Chi­nese ac­cess to In­dian public pro­cure­ment projects point to a greater will­ing­ness to push back against China.</p>
    <p>Sup­port­ing a grander coali­tion vis-a-vis China on the SCS could be an­other mo­ti­vat­ing fac­tor for In­dia. How­ever, the non-claimant coun­tries share lit­tle in terms of strate­gic com­pat­i­bil­ity over the SCS dis­putes. Con­se­quently, there ex­ists no coali­tion among them to ad­dress the dis­puted mar­itime re­gion. The dif­fer­ent – and at times, over­lap­ping – mar­itime claims by Malaysia, Brunei, Viet­nam, the Philip­pines and Tai­wan only add to the com­plex­ity.</p>
    <p>These frag­mented per­spec­tives have so far dis­cour­aged many coun­tries, in­clud­ing In­dia, from tak­ing any spe­cific po­si­tion. If In­dia’s (al­ready con­sid­er­able) com­mer­cial ac­tiv­i­ties in the SCS re­ceive diplo­matic and mil­i­tary sup­port from its non-claimant Quad part­ners, as well as from the South-east Asian claimant coun­tries, Delhi would be more likely to take a bolder step and switch from its neu­tral stance.</p>
    <p>In­dia’s least tan­gi­ble and yet most sig­nif­i­cant stake in the SCS is to sup­port a “rules-based” or­der in line with its vi­sion of the Indo-Pa­cific. To In­dia, this means strength­en­ing cer­tain foun­da­tional prin­ci­ples such as the up­hold­ing of sov­er­eign rights and in­ter­na­tional law, the re­jec­tion of uni­lat­eral ter­ri­to­rial ex­pan­sion and the pro­tec­tion of the global com­mons, in­clud­ing the sea lanes.</p>
    <p>Given the ris­ing sig­nif­i­cance of the SCS in the Indo-Pa­cific cal­cu­lus and with In­dia’s world­view on China chang­ing fast post-Gal­wan, the con­di­tions that once kept Delhi on a cau­tious foot­ing for fear of up­set­ting Bei­jing are fast dis­ap­pear­ing. If push comes to shove, it is likely that In­dia will take a more as­sertive stand on mat­ters re­lated to the South China Sea, and that, in turn, will shape the tra­jec­tory of the con­test for power in this vi­tal wa­ter­way.</p>
