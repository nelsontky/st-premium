    <p>While some chefs look to am­plify, chef Deb­o­rah Yeo is go­ing the other way.</p>
    <p>She is try­ing to do less, to strip down dishes to the el­e­ments and to make each one sing.</p>
    <p>Her food is not frou frou. Far from it. It is gutsy. Her flavours are bold.</p>
    <p>More im­por­tantly, the food goes per­fectly with the nat­u­ral wines Rebel Rebel serves.</p>
    <p>And to think, the Sin­ga­pore food scene al­most lost her to the fi­nance in­dus­try.</p>
    <p>She grad­u­ated from the Na­tional Uni­ver­sity of Sin­ga­pore in 2008 with a de­gree in eco­nomics, and was in in­sur­ance sales for two years in a bank.</p>
    <p>“I hated it and de­cided to take a break and then look for a fi­nance job,” she says.</p>
    <p>“One of my friends said that since I was in­ter­ested in cook­ing, why not step into the kitchen and find out for real.”</p>
    <p>With no for­mal train­ing, she started as a kitchen help in a veg­e­tar­ian restau­rant, work­ing two days a week for two months.</p>
    <p>“I couldn’t hold a knife prop­erly then,” she says.</p>
    <p>Then it was on to big­ger things, at Co­cotte at the Wan­der­lust ho­tel, where she con­tin­ued to learn on the job. Af­ter that, it was two years at Joel Robu­chon Restau­rant in Re­sorts World Sen­tosa.</p>
    <p>At Co­cotte, it was rus­tic French food. At Robu­chon, haute cui­sine. She calls it a good learn­ing ground.</p>
    <p>But it was at Burnt Ends, a mod­ern bar­be­cue restau­rant in Teck Lim Road, that she came into her own.</p>
    <p>She says of chef-owner Dave Pynt: “He got me to learn how to cook. He made sure we tried dif­fer­ent things, that we prac­tised our cook­ing.”</p>
    <p>Af­ter four years there, she went to work for two months at Bri­tish chef April Blooms­field’s Coomb­shead Farm in Corn­wall.</p>
    <p>When she re­turned, Pynt tapped her to help set up the bar­be­cue grill restau­rant he was open­ing in the Wal­dorf As­to­ria Mal­dives Ithaa­fushi. She was at The Ledge by Dave Pynt for 10 months.</p>
    <p>Back in Sin­ga­pore, she landed the job at Rebel Rebel, whose own­ers in­clude Aman­ul­lah Khan of Ar­ti­san Cel­lars and busi­ness­man Eu­gene Goh.</p>
    <p>She says: “The own­ers have been re­ally good. I wanted free rein over the menu and they agreed.”</p>
    <p>The grill is cen­tral to her cook­ing. “Once you cook over real fire, it’s hard to do it any way else.”</p>
    <p>It shows in how sweet the blis­tered padron pep­pers get on the grill, the fierce sear on the tri-tip steak and the smoky flavour of the tur­bot.</p>
    <p>Chef Yeo also has a knack for show­cas­ing in­gre­di­ents not of­ten trum­peted on restau­rant menus. The toasted farro atop her whipped lard is one, as is celeriac in a dish of crab­meat piled in let­tuce leaf cups and chunks of ten­der pig head and crisp fried pig’s ears in her tagli­atelle.</p>
    <p>In the pipe­line is beef tartare, a dish in­volv­ing lamb ribs, and she wants to do some­thing with the prawn heads she has been amass­ing.</p>
    <p>She also wants to delve more deeply into char­cu­terie.</p>
    <p>What is not on the cards is a tast­ing menu, which is out of sync with the wine bar.</p>
    <p>“What peo­ple want here is easy, not too com­pli­cated.”</p>
    <p>Less is more?</p>
