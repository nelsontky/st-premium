    <p>ALIEN HUANG’S GIRL­FRIEND THANKS SUP­PORT­ERS: Wu Han-Chun (right), the girl­friend of late Tai­wanese en­ter­tainer Alien Huang (far right), has bro­ken her si­lence, more than a week af­ter his death on Wed­nes­day last week.</p>
    <p>Huang, 36, was found dead at home and an au­topsy con­cluded that he had died of an aor­tic dis­sec­tion, which led to a block­age of his blood ves­sels.</p>
    <p>A cheer­leader with Tai­wan’s Broth­ers Base­ball Club, Wu was present through­out Huang’s three-day wake.</p>
    <p>The cou­ple had dated in se­cret for 11/ years and she re­vealed their</p>
    <p>2 re­la­tion­ship only af­ter his death.</p>
    <p>On Wed­nes­day, Wu, 30, wrote: “On be­half of Alien Huang, all I can do is to thank ev­ery­one who came to lend sup­port and be with his fam­ily. Thanks to many peo­ple who have given me strength, and thanks to your friends and my friends for stay­ing with me these few days.”</p>
    <p>Wu added that she had spo­ken with Huang’s good friends and the peo­ple he ad­mired.</p>
    <p>She also thanked her late boyfriend’s fam­ily, his good friends and was grate­ful to tele­vi­sion host Jacky Wu, who spoke of how Huang felt about her. Jacky Wu co-hosted the out­door va­ri­ety pro­gramme Mr Player with Huang and Kid Lin.</p>
    <p>In the post, the cheer­leader said she did not know when she would re­cover from her loss, but she said she hoped that ev­ery­one would con­tinue to en­joy Huang’s mu­sic.</p>
    <p>Huang’s la­bel said on Wed­nes­day that a memo­rial, ti­tled The Most Ro­man­tic Con­cert On Earth, is sched­uled to be held at con­cert venue Legacy Taipei at 7pm on Oct 6. The event, which will be broad­cast live on­line, will be hosted by Jacky Wu and Lin.</p>
