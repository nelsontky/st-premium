    <p>To stop Covid-19 from en­ter­ing the coun­try, Sin­ga­pore shut its doors to trav­ellers. But in the last three months, it has grad­u­ally re­opened its bor­ders, in­creas­ing the risk of in­fec­tions creep­ing into the com­mu­nity. To beat the virus while try­ing to re­vive the hard-hit travel and avi­a­tion in­dus­tries, the Repub­lic has set up nu­mer­ous safe­guards – to keep cases low, even as num­bers surge in some other coun­tries.</p>
    <p>A BAL­ANC­ING ACT</p>
    <p>The risk from im­ported cases is not new, and in fact, border con­trols have al­ways been a cor­ner­stone of the Repub­lic’s de­fence strate­gies, ex­perts told The Straits Times.</p>
    <p>But the chal­lenge now is to re­open bor­ders in a safe and con­trolled way amid a pan­demic that is still rag­ing in other parts of the world, said As­so­ciate Pro­fes­sor Josip Car, di­rec­tor of the Cen­tre for Pop­u­la­tion Health Sci­ences at Nanyang Tech­no­log­i­cal Univer­sity’s Lee Kong Chian School of Medicine. The grow­ing knowl­edge of how to stop the virus spread would help the coun­try re­open its bor­ders smartly, he noted.</p>
    <p>But as more coun­tries ex­pe­ri­ence wors­en­ing out­breaks, in­clud­ing In­dia and those in Europe, the Mid­dle East and the Amer­i­cas, it be­comes more im­por­tant to be pru­dent and cau­tious when ar­rang­ing travel green lanes, to pro­tect the frag­ile lo­cal sit­u­a­tion that has been brought un­der con­trol af­ter much ef­fort, said Pro­fes­sor Teo Yik Ying, dean of the Na­tional Univer­sity of Sin­ga­pore’s (NUS) Saw Swee Hock School of Pub­lic Health.</p>
    <p>For in­stance, France reported more than 10,000 new cases on Sun­day, while Bri­tain reported al­most 4,000 cases that same day.</p>
    <p>Con­versely, said Prof Teo, pri­or­ity for travel ar­range­ments should be given to coun­tries with a sta­ble lo­cal sit­u­a­tion and which have sim­i­larly put in place strict pub­lic health mea­sures.</p>
    <p>The big­gest ben­e­fit, when it comes to avi­a­tion and travel, will be through the re­sump­tion of mass mar­ket tourism, but it comes at a price: It poses the great­est risk to the coun­try.</p>
    <p>“Gov­ern­ments world­wide will re­ally need to de­cide whether re­gain­ing the eco­nomic ac­tiv­ity from tourism jus­ti­fies the risk to the rest of the lo­cal econ­omy,” said Prof Teo.</p>
    <p>For some coun­tries, this de­ci­sion is a dif­fi­cult one as tourism drives a ma­jor seg­ment of the lo­cal econ­omy, but for many oth­ers, shut­ting down mass mar­ket tourism to safe­guard the rest of the econ­omy and al­low the rest of the com­mu­nity and so­ci­ety to func­tion is a nec­es­sary com­pro­mise.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore does not ex­pect “no new cases”, and there would be a tol­er­ance for a small num­ber of im­ported cases, said Pro­fes­sor Dale Fisher, a se­nior con­sul­tant in the in­fec­tious dis­eases di­vi­sion at the Na­tional Univer­sity Hos­pi­tal.</p>
    <p>He said it is cru­cial that vis­i­tors en­ter­ing the coun­try con­tinue to obey the rules on mask wear­ing and safe dis­tanc­ing, and not hav­ing gath­er­ings of more than five in a group.</p>
    <p>Asked about the speed at which Sin­ga­pore is re­open­ing its bor­ders, Prof Fisher sug­gested that the coun­try could af­ford to quicken its pace.</p>
    <p>“I am sure there is a lot of be­hindthe-scenes work be­tween gov­ern­ments, health in­sur­ers and those in the travel in­dus­try to make it hap­pen. Any coun­try that has few cases, does con­tact trac­ing quickly and has few un­linked cases should be ‘ap­proved’.”</p>
    <p>If there are ad­di­tional risks, stricter re­stric­tions such as a week­long stay-home no­tice and wear­ing a con­tact-trac­ing de­vice can then be added, Prof Fisher said.</p>
    <p>FAC­TORS TO CON­SIDER</p>
    <p>It is use­ful to break down the im­por­ta­tion risk into three com­po­nents, said As­so­ciate Pro­fes­sor Alex Cook, vice-dean of re­search at NUS Saw Swee Hock School of Pub­lic Health.</p>
    <p>First, as­sess­ing the level of risk of an ar­riv­ing pas­sen­ger be­ing in­fected from that par­tic­u­lar coun­try, which would de­ter­mine which coun­tries to pri­ori­tise hav­ing travel ar­range­ments with.</p>
    <p>Sec­ond, de­ter­min­ing how much of this risk of virus spread to the com­mu­nity can be re­duced through the na­tion’s “fences”, such as hav­ing a two-week quar­an­tine com­pared with a week-long quar­an­tine, or even a rapid test at the air­port.</p>
    <p>The fence is an ap­proach high­lighted by coro­n­avirus an­a­lyst To­mas Pueyo in a New York Times ar­ti­cle this month. Fences are nec­es­sary to con­trol the virus, and are ef­fec­tive if en­forced, he said.</p>
    <p>Fi­nally, the third com­po­nent is that should in­fec­tions creep into the com­mu­nity, how much of this spillover is con­sid­ered tol­er­a­ble, Prof Cook said.</p>
    <p>“(Hav­ing) no spillover in­fec­tions would be per­fect, but of course, we might tol­er­ate one spillover in­fec­tion, or five, if it helps to rein­vig­o­rate the econ­omy. The com­bi­na­tion of these three com­po­nents determines which coun­tries and how many trav­ellers we can ac­com­mo­date,” added Prof Cook.</p>
    <p>Prof Car noted that the kinds of tests and the re­spec­tive thresh­olds should also be con­sid­ered. For ex­am­ple, the amount of ge­netic ma­te­rial that is de­tected be­fore a test is con­sid­ered pos­i­tive and how ac­cu­rate a test is are dif­fer­ent de­pend­ing on the test used.</p>
    <p>Ul­ti­mately, Prof Fisher said, one has to look be­yond case num­bers.</p>
    <p>“It is about whether the coun­try knows where its cases are.”</p>
    <p>Most Malaysian cases were re­cently from two clus­ters in Sabah and Kedah, while most Aus­tralian cases lately have been in Vic­to­ria. Hav­ing a han­dle on where the cases orig­i­nated and be­ing able to ef­fec­tively con­tact trace and quar­an­tine these cases would make the coun­try an un­likely source of in­fected trav­ellers, Prof Fisher said.</p>
    <p>Prof Teo agreed, adding that a well-es­tab­lished and func­tional sur­veil­lance and man­age­ment pro­to­col, and hav­ing the po­lit­i­cal will to iso­late and quar­an­tine when­ever nec­es­sary, will be en­dur­ing as­pects in keep­ing the Covid-19 sit­u­a­tion un­der con­trol.</p>
    <p>An­other as­pect worth not­ing is whether a coun­try is trans­par­ently re­port­ing the lo­cal sit­u­a­tion, or whether there is a con­sid­er­able de­gree of un­der-re­port­ing due to in­suf­fi­cient test­ing ca­pac­ity or in­com­plete sur­veil­lance – for in­stance, when cer­tain seg­ments in the com­mu­nity are over­looked, such as those liv­ing in in­for­mal dwellings like slums, and un­reg­is­tered mi­grant work­ers, Prof Teo said.</p>
    <p>Given how com­plex the pan­demic has been, risk needs to be man­aged with mul­ti­far­i­ous strate­gies, rang­ing from the in­di­vid­ual (be­ing vig­i­lant and ad­her­ing to pro­to­cols, for in­stance) to the gov­ern­ment level, said Prof Car.</p>
    <p>Gov­ern­ment pro­cesses such as rig­or­ous pro­to­cols for test­ing, guid­ance on pre-ar­rival tests and quar­an­tine would be nec­es­sary, and these need to be tai­lored to bal­ance risk, in­con­ve­nience and cost for trav­ellers, Prof Car ex­plained.</p>
    <p>What works in one coun­try may also not be trans­fer­able to an­other due to cul­tural, so­cial, scale or eco­nomic fac­tors, he added.</p>
    <p>“In­di­vid­u­als also need to be re­minded that there is no per­fect test and a neg­a­tive re­sult is not a 100 per cent guar­an­tee that they can­not spread the virus.”</p>
    <p>Re­ly­ing on test­ing to shorten the quar­an­tine pe­riod will al­ways re­sult in some leak­age and this risk in­creases if the trav­eller is com­ing from a lo­ca­tion with a severe out­break, Prof Teo said.</p>
    <p>How­ever, a strict quar­an­tine ef­fec­tively stops many short trips, Prof Cook said, stress­ing that test­ing trav­ellers re­mains key to re­duc­ing risk.</p>
    <p>“The ques­tion is how and when to test to keep the risk tol­er­a­ble. For in­stance, if they are tested be­fore they ar­rive in Sin­ga­pore, they could still be in­fected af­ter the test. I’m in­clin­ing to­wards a rapid test on ar­rival, fol­lowed by a re­peat test a few days later to con­firm neg­a­tiv­ity,” said Prof Cook.</p>
    <p>Ul­ti­mately, Sin­ga­pore’s aim has al­ways been to live with the virus, Prof Fisher said, un­like some coun­tries such as New Zealand, China and Viet­nam, which aim for erad­i­ca­tion.</p>
