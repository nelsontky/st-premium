    <p>Should teach­ers and stu­dents be al­lowed to re­move their masks in the class­room?</p>
    <p>I un­der­stand this virus sur­vives and mul­ti­plies best in cool air. So, for­get about us­ing air-con­di­tion­ing. Let the doors and win­dows be wide open for ven­ti­la­tion and air flow – at home, in work­places and in classes in school. Also, wear a mask and ex­er­cise safe dis­tanc­ing.</p>
    <p>John Tang</p>
    <p>Bet­ter to switch back to home-based learning. Don’t put our young peo­ple at risk with such com­pla­cency again. We have not fully elim­i­nated the risk of spread in the com­mu­nity. It is not like we have had con­sec­u­tive days of zero cases for weeks.</p>
    <p>Taka­hashi Ryosuke</p>
    <p>Covid-19 is still spread­ing quickly. Now that chil­dren and teach­ers have got used to us­ing a mask, it should stay for sure. Shivangini Richards</p>
    <p>Given the close prox­im­ity, it is not a good idea not to wear masks.</p>
    <p>L.Y. Lee</p>
    <p>Teach­ers can con­sider wear­ing a face shield in­stead, while the stu­dents keep their masks on. Kather­ine Liam</p>
    <p>When Covid-19 spreads in school, it will have a huge domino ef­fect. Sap­phire Suz</p>
    <p>Should the Gov­ern­ment relook its plan to give out tablets, lap­tops to se­condary school stu­dents?</p>
    <p>While stu­dents can fig­ure out how to hack these de­vices and IT se­cu­rity is in­ad­e­quate, de­ter­rent mea­sures can re­duce the num­ber of cases. For ex­am­ple, make it a se­ri­ous of­fence where a stu­dent can be ex­pelled or de­moted a year.</p>
    <p>Colin Chee</p>
    <p>Per­haps we can have some units at school for loan to stu­dents who need them.</p>
    <p>Many stu­dents al­ready have tablets and lap­tops at home. Is­su­ing them more units is a waste.</p>
    <p>These de­vices would end up as more of a “game sta­tion” to most se­condary school stu­dents.</p>
    <p>Meili Chng</p>
    <p>Per­haps it’s rea­son­able to re­strict the spon­sored de­vices to fam­i­lies that re­ally need them.</p>
    <p>Or add some in­stal­la­tion “blocker” to pre­vent unau­tho­rised soft­ware from be­ing in­stalled.</p>
    <p>Loh Seet Yoong</p>
    <p>It’s a good time to train them up to take care of the lap­top and be re­spon­si­ble. I am sure they all need to be re­spon­si­ble adults one day – to take care of com­pany prop­erty and fol­low IT poli­cies set by a com­pany.</p>
    <p>Per­haps it’s also a good time to teach them about IT se­cu­rity. S.C. Sim</p>
    <p>Isn’t that a good rea­son to make sure ev­ery­one uses the same lap­top? Have it set up by the In­fo­comm Me­dia De­vel­op­ment Author­ity or other rel­e­vant agen­cies such that the de­vices can ac­cess only school-per­mit­ted re­sources, sim­i­lar to how com­pany lap­tops are mon­i­tored.</p>
    <p>Don’t leave it to the ven­dors that schools out­source their IT re­quire­ments to.</p>
