    <p>The in­te­grated re­sorts are sized for ex­ter­nal de­mand... and were never de­signed solely for do­mes­tic de­mand. Since ex­ter­nal de­mand has been shut off due to Covid-19, their ex­ist­ing lev­els of man­power are just not sus­tain­able.</p>
    <p>I don’t have enough sav­ings to last more than two weeks. Af­ter that, I’m pen­ni­less un­til the set­tle­ment comes in and who knows when that will be.</p>
    <p>The gloomy, over­cast sky on Madam Amy Low’s morn­ing com­mute to work at Re­sorts World Sen­tosa (RWS) seemed a por­tent of things to come when she found out that many of her col­leagues from dif­fer­ent de­part­ments were be­ing called up and re­trenched.</p>
    <p>Then she her­self was told to re­port to a room with sev­eral hun­dred other staff, Madam Low said, where she found out that she, too, was be­ing let go, along with what her su­per­vi­sor said were many oth­ers.</p>
    <p>Last known es­ti­mates of RWS’ work­force in­di­cate that the com­pany had around 7,000 staff at the end of last year. It is un­der­stood that about 2,000 em­ploy­ees were laid off, but when asked, RWS did not want to con­firm any fig­ure.</p>
    <p>Madam Low, 55, a Malaysian, told The Straits Times she had worked in house­keep­ing at RWS for two years. That all came to a swift end yes­ter­day when she was given a bag to put her things in, and ush­ered off the premises.</p>
    <p>She said she was in­formed that re­trenched work­ers would get a sev­er­ance pack­age pegged to the num­ber of years they had worked at RWS.</p>
    <p>ST spoke to six em­ploy­ees let go in the mass re­trench­ment, who said they were told by their bosses that the re­trench­ments af­fected var­i­ous de­part­ments and those let go ranged from clean­ers and se­cu­rity per­son­nel, to front-of-house and house­keep­ing staff, to casino deal­ers and wait­ers at restau­rants and bars.</p>
    <p>For Madam Low, the fu­ture is now un­cer­tain. She said she barely has any sav­ings, and her rent and bills will soon make it dif­fi­cult for her to con­tinue liv­ing in Sin­ga­pore. She was the sole bread­win­ner for her fam­ily of five in Ipoh, as her hus­band is un­em­ployed.</p>
