    <p>Ev­ery year for the past 15 years, en­vi­ron­men­tal sci­en­tists work­ing un­der the aegis of a US gov­ern­ment agency is­sue a re­port on the state of the Arctic, and Tues­day’s edi­tion con­firms an alarm­ing trend: The North Pole is heat­ing up twice as fast as the rest of the planet.</p>
    <p>The year 2020 did not beat the record set in 2012, but it got very close.</p>
    <p>The sea ice float­ing in the Arctic ocean melts i n sum­mer and freezes again in win­ter. The prob­lem is that each year, it is melt­ing a bit more in the warm weather and re­freez­ing a bit less.</p>
    <p>Sci­en­tists now get re­li­able data as satel­lites have been pho­tograph­ing and mea­sur­ing the Arctic non­stop since 1979. And there is no room for doubt about the re­gion’s melt­ing pat­tern.</p>
    <p>The late sum­mer thaw in 2020 was the sec­ond worst year on record af­ter 2012. Com­pared with its high­est his­tor­i­cal level, half of the sea ice is now gone. The ice is thin­ner, younger and more frag­ile.</p>
    <p>The Arctic Re­port Card 2020, re­leased by the Na­tional Oceano­graphic and At­mo­spheric Ad­min­is­tra­tion on Tues­day, pro­vides a wealth of in­for­ma­tion that il­lus­trates the com­plex­ity of the Arctic cli­mate sys­tem.</p>
    <p>The cli­mate in the rest of the world – wind and cur­rents – af­fects what hap­pens at the North Pole while the South Pole is com­par­a­tively more iso­lated.</p>
    <p>Alaska’s North Slope ex­pe­ri­enced its cold­est Fe­bru­ary in 30 years and it was also colder than usual in Sval­bard, Nor­way.</p>
    <p>But Siberia set heat records, with tem­per­a­tures 3-5 deg C above nor­mal, and the re­gion suf­fered ter­ri­ble wild­fires in spring.</p>
    <p>The air tem­per­a­ture at the sur­face of the Arctic over the course of 2019-2020 was 1.9 deg C higher than the av­er­age for the pe­riod in 1981-2010, mak­ing it the sec­ond hottest year on record since 1900.</p>
    <p>The phe­nom­e­non of “Arctic am­pli­fi­ca­tion”, which causes this re­gion to heat up faster than other parts of the world, is in full force.</p>
    <p>The Arctic ocean is also heat­ing up: In Au­gust, the wa­ter was be­tween 1 and 3 deg C hot­ter at the sur­face t han the av­er­age for</p>
    <p>1982-2010.</p>
    <p>Here, too, events are linked and fuel each other. When ice melts and ex­poses the ocean, the wa­ter ab­sorbs more heat from the sun, which in turn wors­ens the melt­ing of the sea ice, although this time from un­der­neath.</p>
    <p>“One of the things that’s im­por­tant to re­alise about the Arctic is it’s a sys­tem. It’s a sys­tem of in­ter­con­nected com­po­nents,” said Dart­mouth Univer­sity’s pro­fes­sor of en­gi­neer­ing Don­ald Perovich, co-au­thor of the sea ice chap­ter in the re­port. “You can change one thing, (and) those changes cas­cade through the whole sys­tem.”</p>
    <p>Sea ice is both an in­di­ca­tor and am­pli­fier of global warm­ing. Its melt­ing does not contribute di­rectly to ris­ing sea lev­els, as this ice is al­ready in the wa­ter. But it does contribute in­di­rectly by heat­ing up the wa­ter.</p>
    <p>Mod­els fore­cast that there will no longer be any sea ice in sum­mer in the Arctic start­ing be­tween 2040 and 2060.</p>
    <p>Back in the first edi­tion of this re­port in 2006, re­searchers were still not sure of the Arctic heat­ing trend. They ex­pressed doubt that per­mafrost – soil that is frozen year round – could melt in the north of Alaska.</p>
    <p>Now, those same re­searchers say “it is an­tic­i­pated that pro­gres­sive deep thaw­ing of per­mafrost in this re­gion may be­gin in 30-40 years”.</p>
