    <p>The Min­istry of Ed­u­ca­tion’s (MOE) ap­proach to Covid-19 cases in schools will be to ringfence and quar­an­tine stu­dents or staff on as small a scale as pos­si­ble, as op­posed to re­act­ing with a full clo­sure of schools.</p>
    <p>Ed­u­ca­tion Min­is­ter Ong Ye Kung said this yes­ter­day, in the wake of a false pos­i­tive case in Jurong West Sec­ondary School that was due to a mis­la­belled sam­ple.</p>
    <p>The case was brought up and ad­dressed by MOE and the Min­istry of Health (MOH) on Tues­day.</p>
    <p>Mr Ong spoke to the me­dia yes­ter­day af­ter a visit to Tampines Sec­ondary School to com­mem­o­rate Racial Har­mony Day.</p>
    <p>Re­spond­ing to a question on how the min­istry would re­act if there is stu­dent-to-stu­dent trans­mis­sion, Mr Ong said the plan is “ac­tu­ally quite es­tab­lished”.</p>
    <p>“If you no­tice how we have re­acted when­ever there was a trans­mis­sion, in­clud­ing that false trans­mis­sion, es­sen­tially we put the en­tire af­fected level on home­based learn­ing.”</p>
    <p>The false pos­i­tive case was a 13-year-old girl who was swabbed be­cause she had been in con­tact with a school­mate, a 13-year-old boy who was pre­vi­ously con­firmed to be in­fected.</p>
    <p>In a state­ment on Tues­day, MOH said the fe­male stu­dent was re­ported to be in­fected based on er­ro­neous test re­sults sub­mit­ted by the lab­o­ra­tory, which had mis­la­belled a swab sam­ple from a Covid-19-pos­i­tive in­di­vid­ual.</p>
    <p>Mr Ong said: “You need to ringfence and quar­an­tine and put stu­dents and teach­ers on leave of ab­sence, but do it on as small a scale as pos­si­ble – if we can do that for a class to keep the school safe, or if not, a level, or maybe a school – as op­posed to al­ways re­act­ing with a full clo­sure or open­ing. I don’t think that is ap­pro­pri­ate.”</p>
    <p>He noted that par­ents and teach­ers seem to un­der­stand this ap­proach, which he said was com­fort­ing.</p>
    <p>When the Sec­ondary 1 level in Jurong West Sec­ondary was closed, more than 90 per cent of stu­dents from the other lev­els con­tin­ued to go to school, said Mr Ong.</p>
    <p>“That means they un­der­stood that by ring-fenc­ing that level, the rest of the school is ac­tu­ally safe – be­cause of our mea­sures, they don’t in­ter­min­gle.</p>
    <p>“So, I think so long as we can keep those pro­ce­dures in place, par­ents and teach­ers un­der­stand, stu­dents un­der­stand, and I think we can make life as nor­mal as we can.”</p>
    <p>Mea­sures that schools have im­ple­mented to re­duce min­gling in­clude stag­ger­ing re­cess tim­ings and hold­ing as­sem­blies in class­rooms.</p>
    <p>Schools have even come up with des­ig­nated routes for stu­dents to get to their class­rooms so they do not meet in the hall­ways or stair­wells.</p>
    <p>Jo­lene Ang</p>
    <p>EN­SUR­ING SAFETY</p>
    <p>You need to ring-fence and quar­an­tine and put stu­dents and teach­ers on leave of ab­sence, but do it on as small a scale as pos­si­ble.</p>
