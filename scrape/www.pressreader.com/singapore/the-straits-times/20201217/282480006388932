    <p>One Cham­pi­onship’s Col­li­sion Course event at the In­door Sta­dium will pro­ceed as sched­uled to­mor­row de­spite an ath­lete i nvolved test­ing pos­i­tive for Covid-19, the mixed mar­tial arts or­gan­i­sa­tion and the Sin­ga­pore Tourism Board (STB) said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>This is the third One event, since it re­turned to stag­ing shows in Oc­to­ber, where an in­di­vid­ual slated to fea­ture in the event has had to with­draw ow­ing to a pos­i­tive test.</p>
    <p>In a joint state­ment, One and STB said the ath­lete, a 29-year-old Rus­sian, had tested pos­i­tive upon ar­rival on Mon­day. He had tested neg­a­tive for Covid-19 be­fore fly­ing from St Petersburg.</p>
    <p>“As part of the strin­gent pro­to­cols for for­eign ath­letes and crew tak­ing part in this event, he was placed in iso­la­tion since ar­rival,” added the state­ment. “Af­ter test­ing pos­i­tive for Covid-19, he was con­veyed to a hospi­tal and is un­der­go­ing treat­ment. A cor­ner­man who was on the same flight and had prior in­ter­ac­tion with the ath­lete is cur­rently serv­ing quar­an­tine in a ded­i­cated fa­cil­ity.”</p>
    <p>In com­bat sport, cor­ner­men can be train­ers, coaches, cut­men or train­ing part­ners, and of­ten spend a lot of time in close prox­im­ity with their fight­ers.</p>
    <p>There are two Rus­sian fight­ers – Marat Ga­furov and Yusup Saadu­laev, both 35 – sched­uled to com­pete in sep­a­rate bouts on Col­li­sion Course, but nei­ther tested pos­i­tive.</p>
    <p>The Straits Times un­der­stands the af­fected ath­lete was slated to be on the Col­li­sion Course II card, which is yet to be an­nounced but is pre-taped on the same night as Col­li­sion Course. This will be broad­cast on a later date.</p>
    <p>Col­li­sion Course is the fourth One live event in Sin­ga­pore since the coro­n­avirus pan­demic.</p>
    <p>It held a closed-door event on Oct 9 and an­other on Oct 30, which was the first live sports event here to wel­come spec­ta­tors. It had 250 fans in at­ten­dance.</p>
    <p>Be­fore the sec­ond In­side the Ma­trix event, cor­ner­men of two ath­letes tested pos­i­tive but they were de­ter­mined to be past in­fec­tions af­ter sero­log­i­cal tests.</p>
    <p>Still, they were kept out of the event as a pre­cau­tion­ary mea­sure and the pro­gramme was not dis­rupted.</p>
    <p>Then, the main event of the third show on Dec 4, called Big Bang, was pulled af­ter one of the fight­ers, Ro­man Kryk­lia, was with­drawn as a pre­cau­tion af­ter com­ing into close con­tact with an in­di­vid­ual who tested pos­i­tive.</p>
    <p>One’s events are part of a pi­lot project the Gov­ern­ment hopes will help iden­tify a model that can be widely im­ple­mented so more large-scale events can re­sume safely in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>Strin­gent pro­to­cols have been adopted and in­clude the re­quire­ment for all for­eign-based ath­letes, cor­ner­men and staff to be iso­lated un­til they re­ceive a neg­a­tive test re­sult, af­ter which they will fol­low a strictly con­trolled itin­er­ary that has been pre-ap­proved.</p>
    <p>For­eign-based ath­letes and One’s pro­duc­tion crew are also re­quired to be tested four times – be­fore they de­part their coun­try, on ar­rival in Sin­ga­pore, as well as be­fore and af­ter the fight.</p>
