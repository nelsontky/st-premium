    <p>Mr Wong Shin Liang, 71, used to be able to lustily belt out sev­eral num­bers at one ago at home or in a karaoke club.</p>
    <p>Not any­more, not since he spent nearly 70 days in the Tan Tock Seng Hos­pi­tal-Na­tional Cen­tre for In­fec­tious Dis­eases (TTSH-NCID) af­ter be­ing di­ag­nosed with Covid-19 in early Fe­bru­ary. “I’m only 60 per cent of my for­mer self. I still get breath­less some­times,” says the for­mer in­fantry of­fi­cer.</p>
    <p>The coro­n­avirus de­bil­i­tated him se­verely; he had pneu­mo­nia and had to be hooked up to a ven­ti­la­tor. He also suf­fered acute in­testi­nal bleed­ing on a cou­ple of oc­ca­sions, re­quir­ing blood trans­fu­sions.</p>
    <p>His mem­ory of his hos­pi­tal stay is some­times hazy, as he was drift­ing in and out of con­scious­ness. But he re­calls hav­ing bizarre dreams, one of which he still vividly re­mem­bers. “I was stay­ing in a five-star ho­tel when a big wave came. I was im­mersed in wa­ter and there was fish around me. Sud­denly, there was a thun­der­storm and dark­ness. The next mo­ment, I saw a rain­bow and I was in a sea­side scene.”</p>
    <p>Mr Wong, who has two daugh­ters, does not know how he con­tracted the virus. He had a mild fever and was ad­mit­ted to TTSHNCID af­ter a blood test and a swab test. The di­a­betic’s con­di­tion de­te­ri­o­rated soon af­ter and be­came so crit­i­cal that he ended up in the In­ten­sive Care Unit on three oc­ca­sions for stays last­ing be­tween two and 20 days.</p>
    <p>Un­known to him, his wife was also warded in the same hos­pi­tal while he was fight­ing for his life although her symp­toms were a lot more be­nign.</p>
    <p>His daugh­ters were sick with worry by the turn of events.</p>
    <p>“The first three weeks were an emo­tional roller coaster ride. I was in a state of griev­ing be­cause of the daily up­dates – they’re in­creas­ing the an­tibi­otics, he has sec­ondary in­fec­tions, he is not im­prov­ing. I didn’t sleep, I didn’t eat,” says elder daugh­ter E.H. Wong, a church worker in her 40s.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, Mr Wong says he is glad to have been given a sec­ond stab at life and spends his time play­ing chess and tend­ing to his fish. “When I eat now, I chew slowly be­fore I swal­low. If you rush, you may choke.”</p>
