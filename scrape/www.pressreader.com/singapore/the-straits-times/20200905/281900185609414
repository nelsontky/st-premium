    <p>• Chi­nese Pres­i­dent Xi Jin­ping said noth­ing will come be­tween the Chi­nese peo­ple and the Com­mu­nist Party that has gov­erned them for more than 70 years, set­ting a de­fi­ant tone in the face of crit­i­cism from the United States.</p>
    <p>Speak­ing at an event mark­ing the 75th an­niver­sary of Ja­pan’s for­mal sur­ren­der at the end of World War II, Mr Xi on Thurs­day out­lined ar­eas where China would “never” ac­cept for­eign in­ter­fer­ence.</p>
    <p>He took aim in par­tic­u­lar at threats to the Chi­nese Com­mu­nist Party’s (CCP) con­tin­ued one-party rule. “The Chi­nese peo­ple will never al­low any in­di­vid­ual or any force to sep­a­rate the CCP and Chi­nese peo­ple, and to pitch them against each other,” Mr Xi said.</p>
    <p>“The Chi­nese peo­ple will never al­low any in­di­vid­ual or any force to dis­tort the CCP’s his­tory, and to vil­ify the CCP’s char­ac­ter and pur­pose.”</p>
    <p>While Mr Xi did not specif­i­cally men­tion the US in the pub­lic ex­cerpts of his re­marks, For­eign Min­istry spokesman Hua Chun­y­ing told re­porters yes­ter­day that US of­fi­cials in­clud­ing Sec­re­tary of State Michael Pom­peo should study them.</p>
    <p>“I would sug­gest Mr Pom­peo and other Amer­i­can politi­cians read Pres­i­dent Xi’s speech,” Ms Hua said, cit­ing the five el­e­ments China would never al­low.</p>
    <p>“For the ex­treme anti-China forces in the US who are vi­ciously try­ing to smear the CCP, and try­ing to sow dis­cord be­tween CCP and the Chi­nese peo­ple, these are the best an­swer to them.”</p>
    <p>The com­bat­ive tone of Mr Xi’s speech high­lights how se­ri­ously China’s lead­ers take the threat of ex­ter­nal chal­lenges to their rule.</p>
    <p>Mr Pom­peo has re­peat­edly sought to dif­fer­en­ti­ate be­tween the CCP and the Chi­nese peo­ple in crit­i­cal re­marks of the regime, in­clud­ing a speech in July at the Richard Nixon Pres­i­den­tial Li­brary in Cal­i­for­nia.</p>
    <p>“Gen­eral Sec­re­tary Xi is not des­tined to tyran­nise in­side and out­side of China for­ever, un­less we al­low it,” Mr Pom­peo said at the time.</p>
    <p>Chi­nese of­fi­cials have at­tacked Mr Pom­peo daily in re­cent months, with Ms Hua call­ing him a “ha­bit­ual liar” again on Thurs­day.</p>
    <p>Chi­nese diplo­mats have also ac­cused the US and its sup­port­ers of at­tempt­ing to deepen the po­lit­i­cal di­vides be­tween Bei­jing and places like Tai­wan and Hong Kong.</p>
    <p>Chi­nese lead­ers have stressed the party’s abil­ity to stand up to for­eign ag­gres­sion since they won con­trol af­ter World War II, which ended on Sept 2, 1945.</p>
