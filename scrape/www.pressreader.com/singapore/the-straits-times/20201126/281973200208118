    <p>Com­pa­nies must keep em­ploy­ees cen­tral to their plans even as they cope with the de­bil­i­tat­ing ef­fects of the coro­n­avirus pan­demic on their op­er­a­tions and bot­tom lines. The need to do so has been un­der­lined in a se­ries of mes­sages and an­nounce­ments in re­cent weeks. These have been timely re­minders be­cause busi­nesses can­not hope to thrive in a post-Covid-19 era if the tri­par­tite sys­tem suf­fers a set­back now should work­ers feel dis­af­fected, dis­grun­tled or alien­ated by quick-fix cor­po­rate so­lu­tions. Gov­ern­ment lead­ers ac­knowl­edge that com­pa­nies should make an ob­jec­tive as­sess­ment of their cur­rent sit­u­a­tion and how best they can ad­vance their in­ter­ests.</p>
    <p>How­ever, whether busi­nesses choose to pivot, trans­form them­selves or right-size, it is im­por­tant to make pro­vi­sions for the well-be­ing of em­ploy­ees, who also are stake­hold­ers and an im­por­tant re­source. Re­minders to com­pa­nies to look af­ter their em­ploy­ees, in­clud­ing through mea­sures such as re­train­ing or re­de­ploy­ment if pos­si­ble, will res­onate with a work­force that is fac­ing an un­cer­tain fu­ture. And rather than be­moan a past that has been sub­verted by the ef­fects of the pan­demic, com­pa­nies must keep fo­cused on the fu­ture and how to emerge stronger. Not only will com­pa­nies ben­e­fit from the loy­alty of re­tained work­ers when the turn­around comes – and there are signs of that hap­pen­ing – but the coun­try also gains from strength­en­ing of so­ci­etal co­he­sion.</p>
    <p>The Gov­ern­ment, on its part, has been pay­ing at­ten­tion to the needs of work­ers in broad ar­eas dur­ing the down­turn. To bet­ter pro­tect them from in­fec­tious dis­eases and work­place ac­ci­dents, for in­stance, the Man­power Min­istry is work­ing closely with bosses and build­ing own­ers on manag­ing risks and stay­ing vig­i­lant. Work­ers are also re­ceiv­ing bet­ter men­tal health sup­port, with a free on­line as­sess­ment tool iWorkHealt­h to be launched early next year to help em­ploy­ers iden­tify sources of work stress. Along with ame­lio­ra­tive moves such as this, em­ploy­ers face puni­tive mea­sures if they treat work­ers’ rights lightly.</p>
    <p>This was seen in how more em­ploy­ers were be­ing in­ves­ti­gated for pos­si­ble dis­crim­i­na­tory hir­ing prac­tices. The Tri­par­tite Al­liance for Fair and Pro­gres­sive Em­ploy­ment Prac­tices in­ves­ti­gated about 260 such cases in the first half of this year, 60 per cent more than in the same pe­riod last year. About 90 em­ploy­ers had their work pass priv­i­leges sus­pended even­tu­ally due to dis­crim­i­na­tory hir­ing prac­tices as at Au­gust this year. Vig­i­lance in in­ves­ti­gat­ing dis­crim­i­na­tory prac­tices and tak­ing er­rant em­ploy­ers to task play an im­por­tant role in up­hold­ing labour’s trust in a tri­par­tite sys­tem that has seen Sin­ga­pore through bad eco­nomic times and pe­ri­ods of growth – from which com­pa­nies have ben­e­fited sub­stan­tially. Tak­ing care of work­ers now is a way for firms to take care of them­selves in the fu­ture.</p>
