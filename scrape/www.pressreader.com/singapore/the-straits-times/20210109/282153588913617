    <p>A sim­ple hug in a desert re­sort, and it was all over. Al­most four years of bit­ter dis­pute be­tween Saudi Ara­bia and its small neigh­bour, Qatar, ended this week as Saudi Crown Prince Mo­hammed bin Sal­man em­braced Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Ha­mad Al-Thani, Qatar’s head of state.</p>
    <p>The move is good news for the Mid­dle East, and a boost for the in­com­ing Joe Bi­den ad­min­is­tra­tion in Wash­ing­ton, which will no longer have to con­tend with yet an­other strate­gic com­pli­ca­tion in a re­gion com­pli­cated enough.</p>
    <p>But the Saudi-Qatari rec­on­cil­i­a­tion should not be seen as a re­turn to the Mid­dle East’s sta­tus quo. For the re­gion is con­tin­u­ing to change in pro­found and mostly un­pre­dictable di­rec­tions.</p>
    <p>The ri­valry be­tween Qatar and Saudi Ara­bia dates back decades and, when stripped of its var­i­ous twists and turns, es­sen­tially boils down to a con­fronta­tion be­tween the Saudis, who are the re­gion’s pre-em­i­nent power and ex­pect to be treated as such, and the diminu­tive Qataris, who re­main de­ter­mined to chart their own way.</p>
    <p>The Saudis have the weight; the Qataris have the nim­ble­ness. But the two also have dif­fer­ent philoso­phies about han­dling their re­gion’s chal­lenges.</p>
    <p>ROOTS OF THE ROW</p>
    <p>Saudi Ara­bia be­lieves that any move­ment or po­lit­i­cal el­e­ment chal­leng­ing the Gulf’s monar­chies should be op­posed and, if pos­si­ble, crushed. But Qatar be­lieves in en­gag­ing with many of these move­ments.</p>
    <p>The Saudis are staunch de­fend­ers of the ex­ist­ing re­gional or­der; the Qataris think they can ride the waves of any po­lit­i­cal change that may sweep through their re­gion.</p>
    <p>And then, there is Al Jazeera – the Qatari-owned news chan­nel that has rev­o­lu­tionised the me­dia busi­ness, not only by pre­sent­ing to the world a dif­fer­ent im­age of the re­gion but also by chal­leng­ing the old, staid me­dia cov­er­age through­out the Mid­dle East.</p>
    <p>Many other TV sta­tions now op­er­ate through­out the re­gion.</p>
    <p>Yet, Al Jazeera has re­mained one of Qatar’s force mul­ti­pli­ers, pro­vid­ing the tiny state of</p>
    <p>2.7 mil­lion in­hab­i­tants – out of which only about a tenth are ac­tual ci­ti­zens – with a large foot­print.</p>
    <p>The most re­cent row be­tween the Saudis and Qataris be­gan in June 2017 when a group of Gulf sheikhdoms led by Saudi Ara­bia im­posed a to­tal air and com­mer­cial block­ade on Qatar.</p>
    <p>The Qataris were pressed to scale down their re­la­tion­ship with neigh­bour­ing Iran, sever al­leged links with rad­i­cal move­ments such as the Mus­lim Brother­hood, cut ties with Tur­key, which has in­creas­ingly backed Qatar, and shut down Al Jazeera’s broad­casts, as well as ac­cept sev­eral other re­stric­tive mea­sures.</p>
    <p>The Qataris were also told that their com­pli­ance was not enough; they were asked to sub­ject their coun­try to pe­ri­odic in­spec­tions by the Saudi-led coali­tion to en­sure that they re­mained pli­ant to their neigh­bours’ de­mands.</p>
    <p>The con­di­tions – and there were 13 in to­tal – were not merely de­signed to emas­cu­late Qatar as an in­de­pen­dent en­tity; they were also in­tended to be as hu­mil­i­at­ing as pos­si­ble.</p>
    <p>HOW NOT TO CON­DUCT DI­PLO­MACY</p>
    <p>In­stead, the Saudi-led block­ade back­fired badly and should now serve as a text­book case for those wish­ing to learn how not to con­duct di­plo­macy.</p>
    <p>The de­mands made by the so-called “quar­tet” of blockad­ing states – Saudi</p>
    <p>Ara­bia, Bahrain, the United</p>
    <p>Arab Emi­rates and Egypt – were drafted in such ab­so­lutist terms that they left no room for com­pro­mise or ne­go­ti­a­tion. In do­ing so, the Saudis broke the first rule of di­plo­macy, which is not to present mat­ters in such a bi­nary way that the only an­swer is ei­ther ac­cep­tance or re­jec­tion.</p>
    <p>In ef­fect, the</p>
    <p>Qataris were pre­sented with the choice of ei­ther to­tal ca­pit­u­la­tion to the quar­tet’s de­mands or stand­ing firm in de­fi­ance of all con­di­tions. No prizes for guess­ing the path Sheikh Tamim chose to take.</p>
    <p>The Saudis also un­der­es­ti­mated their small neigh­bour’s re­silience.</p>
    <p>The block­ade in­flicted un­told hard­ships on or­di­nary peo­ple who could no longer visit their rel­a­tives across the Saudi-Qatari bor­der.</p>
    <p>It also im­posed high costs on Qatar Air­ways, the coun­try’s flag car­rier, which was forced to re­di­rect most of its Western-bound routes to by­pass the airspace of the boy­cotting states.</p>
    <p>And in a na­tion that im­ports most of its food­stuff, the block­ade cre­ated a lo­gis­ti­cal night­mare.</p>
    <p>But the Saudis se­ri­ously mis­cal­cu­lated in as­sess­ing Qatar’s vul­ner­a­bil­i­ties. For the Qataris have shown that there is noth­ing plenty of money from enor­mous oil and nat­u­ral gas re­serves can­not se­cure, pro­vided a na­tion is re­source­ful.</p>
    <p>FAILED SAUDI STRAT­EGY</p>
    <p>The out­come was pre­cisely op­po­site to the one Saudi Ara­bia sought. Qatar’s abil­ity to stand up for it­self grew as its re­la­tions with key Western coun­tries flour­ished. Qatar’s re­liance on Tur­key for its se­cu­rity also in­creased, to the fury of the Saudis.</p>
    <p>And be­cause it was short of friends, Qatar’s co­op­er­a­tion with Iran in­creased – an­other Saudi anath­ema.</p>
    <p>Six months into this block­ade, it was al­ready clear that the en­tire Saudi strat­egy had back­fired; the rest of the time un­til this week was wasted in pre­tend­ing that this was not the case.</p>
    <p>US Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump claims credit for re­solv­ing the dis­pute. But in re­al­ity, he suc­ceeded only in ex­tri­cat­ing him­self and Amer­ica’s Gulf al­lies from a dead­lock for which the Trump White House is at least partly re­spon­si­ble.</p>
    <p>A good case could be made that the Saudis would not have pro­ceeded with the block­ade if they did not get at least a hint from Mr Trump soon af­ter he came to power in early 2017 that the Amer­i­can Pres­i­dent would not be averse to and may ac­tu­ally wel­come this devel­op­ment.</p>
    <p>In­deed, Mr Trump’s tweets early in the Saudi-Qatari stand-off, when he ac­cused Qatar of sup­port­ing ter­ror­ism, in­flamed sen­ti­ments and may have en­cour­aged the Saudis into the mis­taken be­lief that Wash­ing­ton wanted to see Qatar hu­mil­i­ated.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump was also re­spon­si­ble for un­der­min­ing the ef­forts of US diplo­mats, led by his then Sec­re­tary of State Rex Tiller­son, to find an eq­ui­table set­tle­ment to the dis­pute.</p>
    <p>And an even bet­ter case can be made that Saudi Ara­bia’s de­ci­sion to drop the block­ade now did not come so much be­cause of Mr Trump’s de­ci­sion to send Mr Jared Kush­ner, his trusted son-in-law, to ne­go­ti­ate be­tween the Saudis and Qataris, but, in­stead, is due to the re­al­i­sa­tion of all Gulf ac­tors that they’d bet­ter set­tle their dis­putes be­fore Mr Bi­den en­ters the Oval Of­fice in Wash­ing­ton in less than a fort­night.</p>
    <p>WHAT AWAITS BI­DEN</p>
    <p>Be that as it may, the re­moval of the block­ade pro­vides the in­com­ing Bi­den ad­min­is­tra­tion with some re­lief. It no longer must man­age Saudi and Qatari sen­si­tiv­i­ties sep­a­rately.</p>
    <p>And al­though many in the Bi­den team were scep­ti­cal about the Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion’s achieve­ment in per­suad­ing the United Arab Emi­rates and Bahrain to es­tab­lish diplo­matic re­la­tions with Is­rael, the Bi­den ad­min­is­tra­tion is likely to ben­e­fit from this devel­op­ment.</p>
    <p>An opin­ion poll re­cently con­ducted by The Wash­ing­ton In­sti­tute for Near East Pol­icy, a US-based think-tank, in­di­cates that ac­com­mo­da­tion with Is­rael is more pop­u­lar with or­di­nary Gulf Arabs than ini­tially as­sumed:</p>
    <p>47 per cent of Emi­ratis sup­port it, but also 40 per cent of Qataris, not­with­stand­ing the fact that Qatar has not es­tab­lished for­mal re­la­tions with the Jewish state.</p>
    <p>In­ter­est­ingly, the low­est sup­port for an ac­com­mo­da­tion with Is­rael is not in the Gulf where the ques­tion is rel­a­tively re­cent, but in coun­tries nearer Is­rael such as Egypt and Jor­dan, which had diplo­matic links with</p>
    <p>Is­rael for decades.</p>
    <p>So, the newly es­tab­lished ties be­tween Is­rael and the</p>
    <p>Gulf are likely to be more ro­bust than what a lot of ex­perts ini­tially pre­dicted. Yet, as al­ways in the Mid­dle East, the down­sides are just as cru­cial as the more op­ti­mistic de­vel­op­ments.</p>
    <p>First, the re­cent re­gional spat has left deep scars and very lit­tle trust be­tween neigh­bours.</p>
    <p>Dr An­war Gargash, the Emi­rates’ out­spo­ken For­eign Min­is­ter, has al­ready raised con­cerns about Qatar’s con­tin­ued links with Tur­key, in­clud­ing the pres­ence of Turk­ish mil­i­tary bases on Qatari soil.</p>
    <p>Yet, Qatari For­eign Min­is­ter Sheikh Mo­hammed bin Ab­dul­rah­man Al-Thani has not only re­jected any link be­tween the set­tle­ment of the dis­pute and his coun­try’s con­tin­ued al­liance with Tur­key, but also ex­plic­itly re­minded lis­ten­ers that the re­sump­tion of re­la­tions with Saudi Ara­bia would have no ef­fect on Qatar’s re­la­tion­ships with any other coun­try.</p>
    <p>As a re­sult, al­though the Gulf is no longer driven by such a bit­ter public con­fronta­tion, it is still far from united.</p>
    <p>A less frac­tious Gulf re­gion does not nec­es­sar­ily mean a more co­op­er­a­tive one for the US. And this is be­fore one fac­tors in China’s grow­ing foot­print in the re­gion. Saudi Ara­bia’s oil ex­ports to China, for in­stance, in­creased by 43 per cent in the fi­nal months of last year, mak­ing the king­dom China’s largest sin­gle oil sup­plier. And not to be out­done, Qatar’s lead­ing nat­u­ral gas ex­port mar­kets are China and Ja­pan.</p>
    <p>IRAN AND CHINA</p>
    <p>And one area where unity may ex­ist is, para­dox­i­cally, in height­ened sus­pi­cions about the in­ten­tion of the in­com­ing Bi­den ad­min­is­tra­tion to re-en­gage with Iran.</p>
    <p>It will clearly suit Is­raeli Prime Min­is­ter Ben­jamin Ne­tanyahu, who is guar­an­teed to op­pose Mr Bi­den on this ap­proach to Iran, to gal­vanise the sup­port of cru­cial Gulf states.</p>
    <p>And, clearly, some Gulf ac­tors hope to do well in the US through gain­ing the sup­port of the leg­en­dar­ily pow­er­ful pro-Is­rael lobby in Wash­ing­ton. That lobby al­ready re­cently helped the Emi­rates se­cure ac­cess to the F-35 stealth com­bat air­craft, a weapon plat­form the Emi­ratis cov­eted from afar for years.</p>
    <p>Ei­ther way, a less frac­tious</p>
    <p>Gulf re­gion does not nec­es­sar­ily mean a more co­op­er­a­tive one for the US.</p>
    <p>And this is be­fore one fac­tors in China’s grow­ing foot­print in the re­gion. Saudi Ara­bia’s oil ex­ports to China, for in­stance, in­creased by 43 per cent in the fi­nal months of last year, mak­ing the king­dom China’s largest sin­gle oil sup­plier.</p>
    <p>And not to be out­done, Qatar’s lead­ing nat­u­ral gas ex­port mar­kets are China and Ja­pan.</p>
    <p>Yet an­other lit­tle com­pli­cat­ing fac­tor for the in­com­ing Bi­den ad­min­is­tra­tion.</p>
