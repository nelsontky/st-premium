    <p>WASH­ING­TON/BEIJING • US Sec­re­tary of State Mike Pompeo an­nounced on Wed­nes­day that the State Depart­ment was des­ig­nat­ing the Amer­i­can op­er­a­tions of six more China-based me­dia com­pa­nies as for­eign mis­sions, a move he said was aimed at push­ing back against com­mu­nist pro­pa­ganda.</p>
    <p>Mr Pompeo also said at a State Depart­ment news con­fer­ence that the United States would launch a di­a­logue on China with the Euro­pean Union today, and that he would on Sun­day be­gin a trip to In­dia, Sri Lanka, the Mal­dives and In­done­sia, ex­pect­ing to dis­cuss how “free na­tions can work to­gether to thwart threats posed by the Chi­nese Com­mu­nist Party”.</p>
    <p>The State Depart­ment named the newly des­ig­nated pub­li­ca­tions as the Yi­cai Global, Jiefang Daily, the Xin­min Evening News, So­cial Sci­ences in China Press, the Beijing Re­view and the Eco­nomic Daily. This has brought to 15 the num­ber of Chi­nese me­dia out­lets so des­ig­nated this year.</p>
    <p>The an­nounce­ment was the lat­est US step to curb Chi­nese ac­tiv­ity in the coun­try in the run-up to the Nov 3 elec­tion, in which US Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump has made a tough ap­proach to China a key for­eign pol­icy theme.</p>
    <p>Mr Pompeo said the move was part of ef­forts to push back against “Chi­nese com­mu­nist pro­pa­ganda ef­forts” in the US.</p>
    <p>“They are also sub­stan­tially owned, or ef­fec­tively con­trolled, by a for­eign govern­ment,” he said.</p>
    <p>“We are not plac­ing any re­stric­tions on what these out­lets can pub­lish in the United States; we sim­ply want to en­sure that Amer­i­can peo­ple, con­sumers of in­for­ma­tion can dif­fer­en­ti­ate be­tween news writ­ten by a free press and pro­pa­ganda dis­trib­uted by the Chi­nese Com­mu­nist Party it­self. Not the same thing.”</p>
    <p>The US move amounts to “po­lit­i­cal op­pres­sion” and comes from a Cold War men­tal­ity, China’s For­eign Min­istry spokesman Zhao Li­jian told a reg­u­lar news con­fer­ence in Beijing yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>“This is the lat­est po­lit­i­cal sup­pres­sion and stig­ma­ti­sa­tion of the Chi­nese me­dia and jour­nal­ists by the United States, and China will make the nec­es­sary re­sponse in due course,” he said, urg­ing the US to change its de­ci­sion.</p>
    <p>“The US ap­proach to the Chi­nese me­dia... ex­poses the hypocrisy of its self-pro­claimed so-called free­dom of the press.”</p>
    <p>Mr Hu Xi­jin, the edi­tor-in-chief of Chi­nese state-backed Global Times news­pa­per, said the US had “gone too far”.</p>
    <p>He tweeted: “As long as Chi­nese me­dia out­lets suf­fer ac­tual harm, Beijing will def­i­nitely re­tal­i­ate, and US me­dia out­lets’ op­er­a­tion in HK could be in­cluded in re­tal­i­a­tion list.”</p>
    <p>The State Depart­ment has pre­vi­ously re­quired Chi­nese me­dia out­lets to reg­is­ter as for­eign mis­sions, and an­nounced in March that it was cut­ting the num­ber of jour­nal­ists al­lowed to work at the US of­fices of ma­jor Chi­nese me­dia to 100 from 160.</p>
    <p>In re­sponse, China ex­pelled about a dozen Amer­i­can cor­re­spon­dents with The New York Times, News Corp’s Wall Street Jour­nal and The Wash­ing­ton Post.</p>
    <p>The US also said last month it would re­quire se­nior Chi­nese di­plo­mats to get State Depart­ment ap­proval be­fore vis­it­ing Amer­i­can univer­sity cam­puses or hold­ing cul­tural events with more than 50 peo­ple out­side mis­sion grounds.</p>
    <p>Wash­ing­ton des­ig­nated four ma­jor Chi­nese me­dia out­lets as for­eign em­bassies in June and five in Fe­bru­ary. The des­ig­na­tion re­quires the out­lets to in­form the US State Depart­ment of their per­son­nel ros­ters and real es­tate hold­ings.</p>
    <p>DIFFERENTI­ATING WHAT’S WRIT­TEN</p>
    <p>We are not plac­ing any re­stric­tions on what these out­lets can pub­lish in the United States; we sim­ply want to en­sure that Amer­i­can peo­ple, con­sumers of in­for­ma­tion can dif­fer­en­ti­ate be­tween news writ­ten by a free press and pro­pa­ganda dis­trib­uted by the Chi­nese Com­mu­nist Party it­self. Not the same thing.</p>
