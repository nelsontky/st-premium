    <p>The At­tor­ney-Gen­eral’s Cham­bers (AGC) has asked the po­lice to in­ves­ti­gate so­cial me­dia users who have al­leged that ac­cused per­sons in the Or­chard Tow­ers mur­der were given pref­er­en­tial treat­ment in sen­tenc­ing on ac­count of their race.</p>
    <p>In a state­ment yes­ter­day, the AGC re­futed claims that the courts im­pose sen­tences based on the race of of­fend­ers and that mem­bers of mi­nor­ity races are given harsher sen­tences. It said that it will not hes­i­tate to take ac­tion against those who make such false and base­less al­le­ga­tions.</p>
    <p>Such al­le­ga­tions, the AGC said, have the “po­ten­tial to dis­rupt racial har­mony in Sin­ga­pore and cause ir­re­versible di­vi­sions in our com­mu­ni­ties”.</p>
    <p>The AGC added that it has asked the po­lice to in­ves­ti­gate those re­spon­si­ble for al­leg­ing in sev­eral so­cial me­dia posts that those ac­cused of be­ing in­volved in the death of Mr Satheesh Noel Go­bidass last year were given pref­er­en­tial treat­ment.</p>
    <p>It added that the comments could also fall foul of the law on con­tempt of court.</p>
    <p>On July 2 last year, Mr Satheesh, 31, died af­ter be­ing in­volved in a brawl at Or­chard Tow­ers.</p>
    <p>Seven peo­ple were in­volved in the in­ci­dent.</p>
    <p>Af­ter thor­ough in­ves­ti­ga­tions, the AGC found that six of them were not in­volved in caus­ing Mr Satheesh’s death, lead­ing to the charges against them be­ing re­duced.</p>
    <p>The sev­enth per­son, Tan Sen Yang, is the only one now fac­ing a mur­der charge.</p>
    <p>In the state­ment, the AGC said: “At no point did the po­lice and AGC take the race of the de­ceased and the seven in­di­vid­u­als into con­sid­er­a­tion in its de­ci­sion.”</p>
    <p>On Thurs­day, one of the ac­cused, Mr Chan Jia Xing, 27, was given a 12-month con­di­tional warn­ing af­ter fac­ing a lesser charge of con­sort­ing with a per­son car­ry­ing an of­fen­sive weapon in a pub­lic place.</p>
    <p>The AGC said the crime he was charged with took into ac­count Mr Chan’s in­volve­ment, how he tried to stop the at­tack and his co­op­er­a­tion with po­lice in­ves­ti­ga­tions.</p>
    <p>He could re­turn to court if he re­of­fends within a 12-month pe­riod.</p>
    <p>A con­di­tional warn­ing does not amount to a con­vic­tion or a find­ing of guilt – mean­ing that Mr Chan will face no fur­ther ac­tion if he does not com­mit any crimes for a year.</p>
    <p>Ear­lier this year, Joel Tan Yun Sheng, 26, Ang Da Yuan, 26, and Natalie Siow Yu Zhen, 24, pleaded guilty to as­sault charges, among other things.</p>
    <p>Joel Tan was sen­tenced to one month’s im­pris­on­ment, while Ang was sen­tenced to eight months’ im­pris­on­ment and six strokes of the cane. Siow was given five months’ jail last Fri­day in ad­di­tion to the 31/ months she had spent 2 in re­mand.</p>
    <p>The AGC said the sen­tences im­posed were in line with guide­lines is­sued by the courts.</p>
    <p>Three of the ac­cused – Tan Sen Yang, 28, Tan Hong Sheng, 23, and Loo Boon Chong, 26 – have not been sen­tenced yet.</p>
    <p>All seven in­volved in the case had gone as a group to the Naughty Girl Club on the sec­ond floor of Or­chard Tow­ers in the wee hours of July 2 last year.</p>
    <p>They were about to leave at about 6.20am when they ran into another group, and a dis­pute en­sued.</p>
    <p>Mr Satheesh was killed af­ter he con­fronted one of the men who, along with the man’s friends, at­tacked him.</p>
    <p>The brawl was cap­tured by cam­eras out­side a shop on the first floor of Or­chard Tow­ers.</p>
    <p>Closed-cir­cuit tele­vi­sion footage showed Mr Satheesh ex­chang­ing blows with some peo­ple be­fore stum­bling to the ground.</p>
    <p>He ap­peared to be bleed­ing from the neck, while by­standers tried to help him.</p>
    <p>Mr Satheesh was taken to Tan Tock Seng Hospital and died at 7.25am.</p>
