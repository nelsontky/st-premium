    <p>• Since his in­ter­na­tional de­but in 2011, Olivier Giroud (bot­tom) has al­ways been a po­lar­is­ing fig­ure for France sup­port­ers.</p>
    <p>Many fans have cham­pi­oned for a more nat­u­ral fin­isher up front like Karim Ben­zema but de­spite the crit­i­cism, the Chelsea striker has gone about his busi­ness qui­etly.</p>
    <p>His dou­ble at the Stade de France en­sured he ended the year as Les Bleus’ top scorer for the fifth time in six years.</p>
    <p>His re­mark­able record helped the World Cup hold­ers come from be­hind to beat Swe­den 4-2 in the Na­tions League yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Vik­tor Claes­son’s de­flected early strike gave the vis­i­tors the lead be­hind closed doors, but Giroud soon equalised and Ben­jamin Pavard put France ahead be­fore half-time.</p>
    <p>The 34-year-old then headed in a Kylian Mbappe cross to make it 3-1 be­fore the hour mark, tak­ing him to 44 goals in 105 ap­pear­ances for his coun­try.</p>
    <p>Kings­ley Co­man scored France’s fi­nal goal after Robin Quai­son net­ted Swe­den’s se­cond of the night and hav­ing re­cently over­taken Michel Pla­tini’s tally of 41 goals, Giroud, who is se­cond on the all-time list, is now clos­ing in on Thierry Henry’s over­all record mark of 51.</p>
    <p>While he ac­knowl­edged he will never fully win over public opin­ion, he re­mains a key pil­lar for coach Di­dier Deschamps de­spite be­ing on the pe­riph­ery with his club, for whom he has started just one game this sea­son, in the League Cup.</p>
    <p>“I am used to be­ing heck­led and jeered. That has just been part of my ex­pe­ri­ence, of my ca­reer, but it only makes me stronger,” he told lo­cal TV sta­tion M6.</p>
    <p>Deschamps, how­ever, re­mains wor­ried about Giroud’s club sit­u­a­tion ahead of next year’s post­poned Euro 2020, say­ing: “Of course, he has to deal with his sit­u­a­tion, psy­cho­log­i­cally and phys­i­cally but he’s still there and he’s scored two more...</p>
    <p>“I have top-level play­ers and in terms of the mood, that’s per­fect.”</p>
    <p>Euro­pean cham­pi­ons Por­tu­gal rounded off their cam­paign with a 3-2 win at 10-man Croa­tia that gave them se­cond place i n League A Group 3 be­hind France, who qual­i­fied for the semi-fi­nals.</p>
