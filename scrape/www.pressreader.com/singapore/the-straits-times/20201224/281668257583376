    <p>DEMO­CRAT ADAM SCHIFF, on news that US Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump has par­doned sev­eral in­di­vid­u­als, in­clud­ing three cor­rupt for­mer Repub­li­can mem­bers of Congress.</p>
    <p>WASH­ING­TON • Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump has granted cle­mency to two peo­ple who pleaded guilty in the in­quiry into Rus­sian med­dling in his 2016 elec­tion vic­tory, four Black­wa­ter guards con­victed in con­nec­tion with the killing of Iraqi civil­ians and three cor­rupt for­mer Repub­li­can mem­bers of Congress.</p>
    <p>This prompted re­newed crit­i­cism that Mr Trump has used his par­don power to pro­tect po­lit­i­cal al­lies and could gen­er­ate con­cern that he is un­der­min­ing ef­forts at the Jus­tice Depart­ment and the Pen­tagon to en­sure co­op­er­a­tion with crim­i­nal in­ves­ti­ga­tions.</p>
    <p>It was a re­mark­able as­ser­tion of par­don power by Mr Trump, who con­tin­ues to dis­pute his loss in the pres­i­den­tial elec­tion and might well be fol­lowed by other par­dons be­fore he leaves of­fice on Jan 20. In all, he granted full par­dons to 15 peo­ple and com­muted all or part of the sen­tences of five oth­ers.</p>
    <p>One of the most no­table par­dons went to Mr Ge­orge Pa­padopou­los, who was a for­eign pol­icy ad­viser to Mr Trump’s 2016 cam­paign and pleaded guilty in 2017 to mak­ing false state­ments to fed­eral of­fi­cials as part of the in­ves­ti­ga­tion by spe­cial coun­sel Robert Mueller.</p>
    <p>Mr Alex van der Zwaan, a lawyer who pleaded guilty to the same charge in 2018 in con­nec­tion with the spe­cial coun­sel’s in­quiry, was also par­doned.</p>
    <p>Both he and Mr Pa­padopou­los served short prison sen­tences.</p>
    <p>The Mueller-re­lated par­dons are a sig­nal of more to come for peo­ple caught up in the in­ves­ti­ga­tion, ac­cord­ing to peo­ple close to the Pres­i­dent.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump had al­ready par­doned his first na­tional se­cu­rity ad­viser, Mr Michael Flynn, who pleaded guilty twice to charges in­clud­ing ly­ing to the Fed­eral Bureau of In­ves­ti­ga­tion (FBI) in con­nec­tion with the Rus­sia in­quiry.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump’s list of par­dons on Tues­day in­cluded four for­mer US ser­vice mem­bers who were con­victed on charges re­lated to the killing of Iraqi civil­ians while work­ing as con­trac­tors for the pri­vate com­pany Black­wa­ter in 2007.</p>
    <p>One of them, Mr Ni­cholas Slat­ten, had been sen­tenced to life in prison af­ter the Jus­tice Depart­ment went to great lengths to pros­e­cute him.</p>
    <p>Mr Slat­ten had been a con­trac­tor for Black­wa­ter and was sen­tenced for his role in the killing of 17 Iraqi civil­ians in Nisour Square in Bagh­dad – a mas­sacre that left one of the most last­ing stains of the war on the United States. Among those dead were two boys, aged eight and 11.</p>
    <p>The three for­mer mem­bers of Congress par­doned by Mr Trump were Mr Dun­can Hunter of Cal­i­for­nia, Mr Chris Collins of New York</p>
    <p>MIS­USE OF CLAUSE</p>
    <p>and Mr Steve Stock­man of Texas.</p>
    <p>Mr Hunter was set to be­gin serv­ing an 11-month sen­tence next month. He pleaded guilty last year to one charge of mis­us­ing cam­paign funds.</p>
    <p>Mr Collins, an early sup­porter of Mr Trump, had been serv­ing a 26-month sen­tence af­ter plead­ing guilty last year to charges of mak­ing false state­ments to the FBI and con­spir­ing to com­mit se­cu­ri­ties fraud.</p>
    <p>Mr Stock­man was con­victed in 2018 on charges of fraud and money laun­der­ing and had been serv­ing a 10-year sen­tence.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump also par­doned two Bor­der Pa­trol agents who were con­victed of cov­er­ing up the 2005 shoot­ing of a drug dealer on the US-Mex­ico bor­der. The sen­tences of both men had al­ready been com­muted by then Pres­i­dent Ge­orge W. Bush in 2009.</p>
    <p>House In­tel­li­gence Com­mit­tee chair­man Adam Schiff, a Cal­i­for­nia Demo­crat, re­sponded swiftly to the an­nounce­ment of the par­dons. “Lie to cover up for the Pres­i­dent? You get a par­don. Cor­rupt politi­cian who en­dorsed Trump? You get a par­don. Mur­der in­no­cent civil­ians? You get a par­don,” Mr Schiff said on Twit­ter. “Elect a cor­rupt man as pres­i­dent? You get a cor­rupt re­sult.”</p>
    <p>An­other Demo­crat, Sen­a­tor Richard Blu­men­thal of Con­necti­cut, said in a state­ment: “I doubt gov­ern­ment con­trac­tors who slaugh­tered civil­ians or cor­rupt Con­gres­sional cronies were what the Founders had in mind when they drafted the par­don clause.”</p>
    <p>Mr Trump on Tues­day also ap­pointed sev­eral key aides to the boards of pub­lic in­sti­tu­tions, a sign he is plan­ning for his de­par­ture from the White House de­spite his re­fusal to con­cede.</p>
    <p>It re­mains un­clear if he will at­tend Mr Joe Biden’s in­au­gu­ra­tion cer­e­mony on Jan 20, but he has in­di­cated he will leave the White House when his term ends.</p>
    <p>I doubt gov­ern­ment con­trac­tors who slaugh­tered civil­ians or cor­rupt Con­gres­sional cronies were what the Founders had in mind when they drafted the par­don clause. SEN­A­TOR RICHARD BLU­MEN­THAL OF CON­NECTI­CUT</p>
