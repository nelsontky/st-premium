    <p>Gold­man Sachs Sin­ga­pore will pay US$122 mil­lion (S$165 mil­lion) to the Sin­ga­pore Gov­ern­ment for its role in the 1Malaysia Devel­op­ment Ber­had (1MDB) bond of­fer­ings cor­rup­tion scan­dal.</p>
    <p>The penalty is be­lieved to be the largest im­posed on a fi­nan­cial in­sti­tu­tion here, and will be paid by Gold­man’s lo­cal unit to the Sin­ga­pore Gov­ern­ment’s Con­sol­i­dated Fund.</p>
    <p>The Sin­ga­pore pay­ment is part of the nearly US$3 bil­lion that par­ent Gold­man Sachs has agreed to pay to the United States au­thor­i­ties af­ter its Malaysia unit said it would plead guilty to vi­o­lat­ing for­eign bribery laws.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore’s Com­mer­cial Af­fairs De­part­ment (CAD) has also served</p>
    <p>Gold­man Sachs Sin­ga­pore with a 36-month con­di­tional warn­ing, in lieu of pros­e­cu­tion, for three counts of cor­rup­tion of­fences pun­ish­able un­der Sec­tion 5(b)(i) of the Pre­ven­tion of Cor­rup­tion Act, Chap­ter 241.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, the Mone­tary Au­thor­ity of Sin­ga­pore (MAS) has directed the Sin­ga­pore unit of Gold­man Sachs to ap­point an in­de­pen­dent ex­ter­nal party to con­duct a review of its re­me­dial mea­sures, it said in a joint state­ment with the At­tor­ney-Gen­eral’s Cham­bers and CAD yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The MAS, in a sep­a­rate state­ment, said that it has is­sued a life­time ban on Mr Kevin Michael Swampil­lai, the for­mer head of the wealth man­age­ment ser­vices at BSI Bank’s Sin­ga­pore branch.</p>
    <p>The pro­hi­bi­tion or­ders (POs) against Mr Swampil­lai–a Malaysian – were is­sued at the con­clu­sion of an in­ves­ti­ga­tion con­ducted by the MAS and took ef­fect on Thurs­day, the reg­u­la­tor said.</p>
    <p>BSI Bank’s Sin­ga­pore unit was shut down in 2016 for its role in the scan­dal, and the Swiss bank made a com­po­si­tion pay­ment of $13.3 mil­lion.</p>
    <p>In its state­ment, the MAS said that from 2012 to 2013, Mr Swampil­lai and his then Sin­ga­porean sub­or­di­nate Yeo Ji­awei had as­sisted 1MDB to re­struc­ture sev­eral of its joint ven­ture in­ter­ests.</p>
    <p>In that time, they chan­nelled about US$5 mil­lion as a por­tion of the fund man­age­ment fees – “se­cret prof­its” – to an en­tity ben­e­fi­cially owned by Mr Swampil­lai. This was done with­out BSI Bank’s knowl­edge and au­tho­ri­sa­tion.</p>
    <p>The MAS said Mr Swampil­lai also de­lib­er­ately made mis­rep­re­sen­ta­tions to 1MDB’s au­di­tors in a bid to “im­prop­erly in­flu­ence” them.</p>
    <p>He mis­rep­re­sented that the as­sets held by PetroSaudi Oil Ser­vices, one of 1MDB’s in­vest­ments, were liq­uid in na­ture and mostly cash, even though he knew that the as­sets com­prised two drill ships.</p>
    <p>The 1MDB scan­dal dates to the gov­ern­ment of for­mer Malaysian prime min­is­ter Na­jib Razak, which set up the state in­vest­ment firm in 2009.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to US pros­e­cu­tors, Gold­man paid more than US$1.6 bil­lion in bribes to for­eign of­fi­cials in Malaysia and Abu Dhabi be­tween 2002 and 2014 to win 1MDB busi­ness.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore’s case against Gold­man stems from CAD’s in­ves­ti­ga­tion of Gold­man Sin­ga­pore’s for­mer man­ag­ing di­rec­tors Tim Leiss­ner and Roger Ng over three bond of­fer­ings un­der­writ­ten by Gold­man Sachs In­ter­na­tional for 1MDB sub­sidiaries.</p>
    <p>In Au­gust 2018, Ger­man banker Leiss­ner pleaded guilty in a US dis­trict court to one count of con­spir­acy to vi­o­late the For­eign Cor­rupt Prac­tices Act and one of con­spir­acy to com­mit money laun­der­ing. Fol­low­ing his guilty plea, the MAS in De­cem­ber 2018 in­creased the 10-year PO against him to a life­time ban.</p>
    <p>Ng is in the US, where he has been charged with con­spir­ing to laun­der money and bribe gov­ern­ment of­fi­cials in Malaysia and Abu Dhabi. Un­der an ex­tra­di­tion deal, Ng, a Malaysian, will be re­turned to Malaysia af­ter the com­ple­tion of his US trial, due to be­gin next year.</p>
    <p>In all, Gold­man’s penal­ties will ex­ceed US$5 bil­lion glob­ally, equiv­a­lent to about two-thirds of a year’s earn­ings.</p>
    <p>Gold­man will pay US$2.3 bil­lion to the US Jus­tice De­part­ment and other reg­u­la­tors, and a fur­ther US$600 mil­lion in dis­gorge­ment of ill-got­ten gains to set­tle the US probe and avoid a crim­i­nal con­vic­tion.</p>
    <p>This is in ad­di­tion to the US$3.9 bil­lion that Gold­man has agreed to pay Malaysia in ex­change for drop­ping all crim­i­nal charges against the bank.</p>
    <p>Gold­man will also pay Hong Kong US$350 mil­lion.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore’s Com­mer­cial Af­fairs De­part­ment has also served Gold­man Sachs Sin­ga­pore with a 36-month con­di­tional warn­ing, in lieu of pros­e­cu­tion, for three counts of cor­rup­tion of­fences pun­ish­able un­der Sec­tion 5(b)(i) of the Pre­ven­tion of Cor­rup­tion Act, Chap­ter 241.</p>
