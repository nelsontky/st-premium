    <p>The Sin­ga­pore Tourism Board (STB) is look­ing into a pos­si­ble breach of Covid-19 safety mea­sures on board a Royal Caribbean cruise.</p>
    <p>A group of more than 10 men and women had gath­ered to take pho­tos on Dec 20 and 21 while they were on the ship.</p>
    <p>In the pho­tos, which some of them had posted on their pub­lic In­sta­gram ac­counts, mem­bers of the group were un­masked and stand­ing less than 1m apart from one another.</p>
    <p>Be­fore Mon­day, so­cial gath­er­ings of more than five peo­ple were pro­hib­ited dur­ing phase two of Sin­ga­pore’s re­open­ing. Since then, with phase three kick­ing in, the rule has been eased, but gath­er­ings of more than eight peo­ple are still not al­lowed.</p>
    <p>Re­spond­ing to queries from The Straits Times, Ms An­nie Chang, STB’s di­rec­tor of cruise, said on Wed­nes­day night that STB is aware of the al­leged in­ci­dent and is look­ing into the mat­ter.</p>
    <p>“We take a se­ri­ous view of any breach in safe man­age­ment mea­sures on cruises de­part­ing from Sin­ga­pore. The safety of pas­sen­gers and crew is our pri­or­ity, and reg­u­lar on-board in­spec­tions are con­ducted dur­ing sail­ings to en­sure com­pli­ance,” she said.</p>
    <p>Cruise lines that do not com­ply with STB’s CruiseSafe penalty frame­work will be sub­ject to penalties, which can in­clude fines, sus­pen­sion of sail­ings and hav­ing their CruiseSafe cer­ti­fi­ca­tion re­voked.</p>
    <p>A Royal Caribbean In­ter­na­tional spokesman ac­knowl­edged the in­ci­dent, and added that it is in­ves­ti­gat­ing the mat­ter. “The re­cent breach in safe dis­tanc­ing mea­sures seems to have been an in­stance where a group gath­ered for some pic­tures,” said the cruise op­er­a­tor.</p>
    <p>It re­it­er­ated that the same mea­sures malls and restau­rants abide by ap­ply on board its cruises.</p>
    <p>Royal Caribbean In­ter­na­tional added that its staff are trained to re­mind guests to com­ply with health and safety regulation­s on board.</p>
    <p>“We would like to re­mind our guests that any fail­ure to com­ply with the rules will lead to en­force­ment ac­tion, in­clud­ing be­ing de­nied board­ing or re­moval from the ship,” it said.</p>
    <p>In a sep­a­rate case, a video posted on Facebook showed a group of 10 peo­ple in close prox­im­ity on board a yacht.</p>
    <p>The user who posted the video last Satur­day said it was taken near Lazarus Is­land on the same day.</p>
    <p>In the 15-se­cond video, the group of men and women could be seen danc­ing. While none of them was wear­ing a mask, three could be seen with Christ­mas hats.</p>
    <p>A spokesman for the Mar­itime and Port Au­thor­ity of Sin­ga­pore (MPA) said it has been in­formed of the video and is in­ves­ti­gat­ing.</p>
    <p>The spokesman added: “MPA takes a se­ri­ous view of any breach of Covid-19 regulation­s and will not hes­i­tate to take ac­tion against such breaches.</p>
    <p>“MPA regularly pa­trols our wa­ters. We urge the pub­lic, as well as ves­sel own­ers and op­er­a­tors, to be re­spon­si­ble and com­ply with all Covid-19 safe man­age­ment mea­sures, in­clud­ing wear­ing a mask and ad­her­ing to pas­sen­ger lim­its on board plea­sure crafts.”</p>
    <p>We take a se­ri­ous view of any breach in safe man­age­ment mea­sures on cruises de­part­ing from Sin­ga­pore. The safety of pas­sen­gers and crew is our pri­or­ity, and reg­u­lar on-board in­spec­tions are con­ducted dur­ing sail­ings to en­sure com­pli­ance.</p>
