    <p>Sem­b­corp Marine (Sem­bMarine) shares ral­lied by up to nearly 13 per cent yes­ter­day on ro­bust turnover with mar­ket watch­ers at­tribut­ing the surge to “beaten down cycli­cals”, a rise in crude prices, broader vac­cine op­ti­mism – and renewed hopes for a merger.</p>
    <p>Within the first two hours of trad­ing, the counter shot up to 15 cents, gain­ing 1.7 cents or 12.8 per cent. By 12.30pm, the stock had pared some gains and was trad­ing at 14.5 cents – up 1.2 cents or 9 per cent.</p>
    <p>The stock even­tu­ally closed at 15 cents, up 12.78 per cent for the day.</p>
    <p>Sem­bMarine’s ad­vance out­per­formed the bench­mark Straits Times In­dex, which fin­ished up 1.27 per cent.</p>
    <p>Trad­ing ac­tiv­ity on the counter was also higher with 217 mil­lion shares done worth nearly $31 mil­lion, mak­ing it the day’s fifth most ac­tive by mid­day trad­ing.</p>
    <p>“The rise in crude oil prices is help­ing to drive in­ter­est in Sem­b­corp Marine, al­though this is all part of the broader vac­cine op­ti­mism that has helped the as­sets, sen­si­tive to both risk and growth out­look, climb into the start of the week,” re­marked Ms Pan Jingyi, se­nior mar­ket strate­gist at IG.</p>
    <p>She added: “With hopes that the vac­cine de­ploy­ment in De­cem­ber could even­tu­ally lead to wide­spread vac­ci­na­tion, there has been an­tic­i­pa­tion of a re­cov­ery in de­mand within the crude oil mar­ket and there­fore, its re­lated in­dus­tries. From a tech­ni­cal per­spec­tive, prices have also bro­ken above the 50-day mov­ing av­er­age, ex­hibit­ing a bullish sig­nal.”</p>
    <p>Crude prices firmed dur­ing the Asian ses­sion yes­ter­day, led by con­tin­ued op­ti­mism since last week over the progress of coro­n­avirus vac­cine de­vel­op­ments and their roll-outs.</p>
    <p>The en­cour­ag­ing news has fu­elled hope that eco­nomic ac­tiv­ity could pick up and along­side that, en­ergy de­mand, de­spite the con­tin­ued rise in Covid-19 cases in many coun­tries.</p>
    <p>Brent, the key global oil bench­mark, is up 0.4 per cent, while West Texas In­ter­me­di­ate rose 0.2 per cent.</p>
    <p>Some sus­pect that one other fac­tor that may be gal­vanis­ing Sem­bMarine’s stock could be the big reshuf­fle at con­glom­er­ate Kep­pel Corp and more specif­i­cally the ap­point­ment of Mr Chua Hsien Yang as di­rec­tor of group M&A, a newly cre­ated po­si­tion.</p>
    <p>Mr Chua, cur­rently the chief ex­ec­u­tive of­fi­cer of Kep­pel DC Reit Man­age­ment, has ex­ten­sive ex­pe­ri­ence in the real es­tate fund man­age­ment and hos­pi­tal­ity in­dus­tries, in­clud­ing M&A (merg­ers and ac­qui­si­tions), and will drive Kep­pel’s sharp­ened and more dis­ci­plined M&A strat­egy, said the com­pany in a state­ment.</p>
    <p>Kep­pel had ear­lier said that its off­shore and marine unit, hit by the pan­demic-led oil slump, was un­der a strate­gic re­view where “all op­tions, both or­ganic and in­or­ganic”, were be­ing con­sid­ered.</p>
    <p>That plus the lead­er­ship changes at Kep­pel, chiefly in­clud­ing an in­di­vid­ual ded­i­cated to drive M&A, has re­vived spec­u­la­tion of a mega merger be­tween the two gi­ant rig builders, Kep­pel Off­shore & Marine and Sem­bMarine – a long-an­tic­i­pated and hoped for, but yet to hap­pen, con­sol­i­da­tion.</p>
    <p>“In the cur­rent cli­mate – ris­ing com­pe­ti­tion and down­turn – I don’t see these two com­pa­nies end­ing up stand­ing alone for­ever. It is not un­rea­son­able for the mar­ket to read it (Kep­pel’s lat­est ap­point­ment) as one with an eye on in­dus­try con­sol­i­da­tion,” said a mar­ket watcher.</p>
    <p>He added: “But it takes two hands to clap. There will be chal­lenges. This will not be a merger of equals but more an ac­qui­si­tion. Will Sem­bMarine go for it?”</p>
