    <p>Pana­sonic makes a wide range of au­dio equip­ment. So, it is sur­pris­ing the Ja­panese tech gi­ant has just en­tered the crowded true wire­less in-ear head­phones fray, with the RZ-S500W.</p>
    <p>One of the few on the mar­ket to have ac­tive noise can­cel­la­tion (ANC) tech­nol­ogy, it comes i n white and black (ver­sion tested) and has a min­i­mal­ist de­sign. Each ear­bud has a round bul­bous body with a touch-sen­si­tive ex­te­rior sur­rounded by a sil­ver semi-ring.</p>
    <p>A tiny stem con­nects to the ear tip. Five pairs of dif­fer­ent-size tips are in­cluded for the right fit.</p>
    <p>The charg­ing case, in match­ing matt-black fin­ish, has a USB-C port at its rear for charg­ing, but does not sup­port wire­less charg­ing.</p>
    <p>Com­pared with its com­peti­tors, the RZ-S500W’s ear­buds are a tad large and bulky. They pro­trude slightly from your ears.</p>
    <p>But the size also al­lows the ear­buds to an­chor them­selves well in your ears. The ear­buds stay snug dur­ing my jogs and when I try to dis­lodge them by shak­ing my head vig­or­ously. Plus, they feel com­fort­able even when I wear them for hours.</p>
    <p>The ear­buds’ IPX4 rat­ing for re­sis­tance against sweat and wa­ter splashes means you can wear them for a run when it is driz­zling, though not when there is a tor­ren­tial down­pour.</p>
    <p>They use 8mm driv­ers for au­dio out­put, while their ANC comes with what Pana­sonic coins as dual hy­brid noise-can­celling tech­nol­ogy, which com­bines feed­for­ward ANC with feed­back ANC.</p>
    <p>Feed­for­ward ANC uses an ex­ter­nal mi­cro­phone to cap­ture noise and har­nesses dig­i­tal pro­cess­ing to re­pro­duce sig­nals to can­cel out the noise, while feed­back ANC uses an in­ter­nal mi­cro­phone to cap­ture noise in your ears and ana­logue pro­cess­ing to can­cel out the noise.</p>
    <p>The re­sult is one of the best ANC ex­pe­ri­ences I have had – bet­ter­ing Ap­ple’s AirPods Pro and on a par with Sony’s im­pres­sive WF-1000XM3. I can hardly hear the din from the home-im­prove­ment project that is go­ing on above my flat when wear­ing the RZ-S500W.</p>
    <p>The RZ-S500W also comes with am­bi­ent sound con­trol, which al­lows you to hear the sur­round­ings. This is great for when cy­cling and jog­ging, or when you want to hear what is go­ing on around you.</p>
    <p>You can use the Pana­sonic Au­dio Con­nect app (avail­able on An­droid and iOS) to up­date firmware, ad­just the in­ten­sity of the ANC and am­bi­ent sound con­trol and tweak the equaliser (EQ) set­tings. How­ever, the app can­not change the tap con­trols on the ear­buds.</p>
    <p>Thank­fully, the touch con­trols are not as con­fus­ing as those on some true wire­less in-ear head­phones. Tap once on ei­ther ear­bud to play or pause a track. A dou­ble­tap on the right ear­bud skips the track for­ward, while a triple-tap skips the track back­wards. Dou­ble or triple tap on the left ear­bud to lower or in­crease the vol­ume.</p>
    <p>Press and hold the right ear­bud to cy­cle through ANC on, Am­bi­ent Sound and ANC off. Do the same with the left ear­bud to ac­ti­vate your smart­phone’s voice as­sis­tant.</p>
    <p>With the equaliser set­tings set at flat, I find the au­dio out­put to be rich in the highs and de­tailed in the mids. The bass can be punchier, but the app has a bass en­hancer EQ pre­set that boosts the bass while keep­ing the mids and highs sharp.</p>
    <p>For those who like vo­cal-driven mu­sic, there is a clear voice EQ pre­set that am­pli­fies vo­cals nicely. Over­all, the au­dio qual­ity is su­perb.</p>
    <p>The RZ-S500W’s bat­tery life is one of the best in its class too. Lis­ten­ing to mu­sic with ANC switched on and at 75 per cent vol­ume, it lasts six hours – not far from its rated six hours and 30 min­utes. The charg­ing case is said to add an­other 13 hours of play­back time.</p>
    <p>It is per­haps a pity the RZ-S500W ($349) is priced in the same ball­park as the AirPods Pro ($379) and WF-1000XM3 ($349).</p>
    <p>It is a great pair of true wire­less in-ear head­phones, but for this price, many iPhone users will prob­a­bly go for the AirPods Pro, given its tight in­te­gra­tion with the Ap­ple ecosys­tem, while oth­ers could favour en­trenched genre lead­ers such as the WF-1000XM3.</p>
