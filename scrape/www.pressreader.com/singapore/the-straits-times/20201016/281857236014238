    <p>WASH­ING­TON The US State Depart­ment has sub­mit­ted a pro­posal for the Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion to add China’s Ant Group to a trade black­list, ac­cord­ing to two peo­ple fa­mil­iar with the mat­ter, be­fore the fi­nan­cial tech­nol­ogy firm is slated to go pub­lic.</p>
    <p>The move comes as China hard­lin­ers in the Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion are seek­ing to send a mes­sage to de­ter US in­vestors from tak­ing part in the ini­tial pub­lic of­fer­ing (IPO) for Ant, a dual list­ing in Shang­hai and Hong Kong that could be worth up to a record US$35 bil­lion (S$47.6 bil­lion).</p>
    <p>It was not i mme­di­ately clear when the US gov­ern­ment agen­cies that de­cide whether to add a com­pany to the so-called en­tity list would re­view the mat­ter.</p>
    <p>The lat­est swipe at China comes in the run-up to the Nov 3 elec­tion, in which US Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump, trail­ing in the polls against his Demo­cratic ri­val Joe Bi­den, has made a tough ap­proach to China an im­por­tant for­eign pol­icy plat­form.</p>
    <p>While the Ali­pay pay­ment app is cur­rently un­avail­able for Amer­i­can users in the United States, ac­cord­ing to a spokesman for Ant, Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion of­fi­cials fear the Chi­nese gov­ern­ment could ac­cess sen­si­tive bank­ing data be­long­ing to fu­ture US users.</p>
    <p>The US State Depart­ment did not re­spond to a re­quest for com­ment.</p>
    <p>Ant, an af­fil­i­ate of Alibaba Group, de­clined to com­ment but has re­cently stressed that only 5 per cent of its busi­ness is out­side China.</p>
    <p>“China op­poses the US abus­ing the con­cept of na­tional se­cu­rity and its na­tional power to op­press for­eign coun­tries. This is a bul­ly­ing prac­tice,” Chi­nese For­eign Min­istry spokesman Zhao Li­jian said dur­ing a reg­u­lar brief­ing yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>“China will con­tinue tak­ing nec­es­sary mea­sures to safe­guard the le­git­i­mate rights and in­ter­ests of Chi­nese com­pa­nies.”</p>
    <p>The en­tity list, which makes it more dif­fi­cult for US firms to sell high-tech items to black­listed com­pa­nies, has be­come the tool of choice for the Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion to pun­ish Chi­nese com­pa­nies, though its real-world im­pact is some­times ques­tion­able.</p>
    <p>While curb­ing ac­cess to US tech­nol­ogy deals a blow to firms like Chi­nese tele­coms gi­ant Huawei Tech­nolo­gies, which was added in May last year, the im­pact on a fin­tech gi­ant such as Ant is likely to be more sym­bolic and does not pre­vent US in­vestors from tak­ing stakes in it.</p>
    <p>Ant is China’s dom­i­nant mo­bile pay­ments firm, of­fer­ing loans, pay­ments, in­sur­ance and as­set man­age­ment ser­vices via apps. It is 33 per cent owned by Alibaba and con­trolled by Alibaba founder Jack Ma.</p>
    <p>Ant’s Ali­pay pay­ment plat­form, like Ten­cent’s WeChat plat­form, is used pri­mar­ily by Chi­nese cit­i­zens with ac­counts in ren­minbi. Most of its US in­ter­ac­tions are with mer­chants ac­cept­ing pay­ment from Chi­nese trav­ellers and busi­nesses in the coun­try.</p>
    <p>Sen­a­tor Marco Ru­bio, who has suc­cess­fully urged the Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion to pur­sue in­ves­ti­ga­tions of Chi­nese com­pa­nies, called last week for the US gov­ern­ment to con­sider op­tions to de­lay Ant’s IPO.</p>
    <p>The im­pact of such black­list­ing on firms seek­ing an IPO is ev­i­denced by the fail­ure of Chi­nese ar­ti­fi­cial in­tel­li­gence firm Megvii Tech­nol­ogy to clear a hear­ing with the Hong Kong ex­change last Novem­ber, en route to a planned list­ing of US$500 mil­lion.</p>
    <p>The ex­change sought more in­for­ma­tion from Megvii, in­clud­ing de­tails of its suit­abil­ity for a Hong Kong IPO, after the US put it on a trade black­list in Oc­to­ber last year.</p>
    <p>Ap­proval for Ant’s IPO has been de­layed. On Tues­day, Reuters re­ported that China’s se­cu­ri­ties reg­u­la­tor is prob­ing a po­ten­tial con­flict of in­ter­est in Ant’s planned stock list­ing.</p>
