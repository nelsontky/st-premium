    <p>For­mer drug ad­dict Leau Ian Tong, 32, used to see The Help­ing Hand as a road­block stand­ing be­tween him and his fam­ily.</p>
    <p>Hav­ing com­pleted eight months of treat­ment at the Drug Re­ha­bil­i­ta­tion Cen­tre (DRC) fa­cil­ity in Changi Pri­son, he yearned to leave the half­way house sooner and go home to be with his aged par­ents.</p>
    <p>But as the days of his man­dated 10-month com­mu­nity su­per­vi­sion passed, Mr Leau came to re­alise that the struc­tured pro­gramme ben­e­fited his re­cov­ery.</p>
    <p>Af­ter his stint as a res­i­dent at the half­way house in Up­per Seran­goon Road, Mr Leau joined The Help­ing Hand as an in­tern so he could sup­port oth­ers like him. In the fu­ture, he plans to take on a man­age­ment role to over­see op­er­a­tions at the half­way house.</p>
    <p>Mr Leau, who has done two stints in the DRC, said that as a res­i­dent at The Help­ing Hand, he was con­stantly wor­ried about his par­ents. Dur­ing that time, he was al­lowed to go home only on Sun­days, and for just a few hours.</p>
    <p>“As (my par­ents) are old, I was very wor­ried for them, par­tic­u­larly dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker,” he said.</p>
    <p>Mr Leau re­called hav­ing to teach his par­ents how to stay safe and order items on­line, and ached at the thought of not be­ing by their side in their mo­ments of need.</p>
    <p>“Even­tu­ally, I re­alised the half­way house was a good place for me to re­cover as there were pro­grammes to help res­i­dents and a good sup­port net­work to rely on,” he said.</p>
    <p>“Even af­ter I re­turned home, I felt that I could con­trib­ute to the half­way house and felt very com­fort­able there.”</p>
    <p>For Mr Leau, Christ­mas this year was spent hav­ing a potluck with his fam­ily and girl­friend, and watch­ing his nieces and neph­ews re­ceive their presents.</p>
    <p>Mr Leau’s 66-year-old mother, who wanted to be known only as Madam Loo, said the fam­ily was glad to have him back for Christ­mas and proud of him for over­com­ing his chal­lenges.</p>
    <p>“Grow­ing up, my son had al­ways looked for­ward to the fam­ily gath­er­ings and gifts, and now that he’s older, it’s about giv­ing to his nieces and neph­ews. It’s a day for us as a fam­ily to come to­gether – like every other fes­tive cel­e­bra­tion,” she said.</p>
    <p>Founded in 1987, The Help­ing Hand is a Chris­tian half­way house which of­fers fam­ily coun­selling, life-skills learn­ing and af­ter­care as­sis­tance to its res­i­dents, to help them stay crime- and drug-free for the long run.</p>
    <p>Mr Leau now helps to de­velop busi­ness con­ti­nu­ity plans and projects for res­i­dents at the half­way house, and man­ages its op­er­a­tions across depart­ments.</p>
    <p>He said his faith and the half­way house’s sup­port net­work have strength­ened his re­solve to stay away from drugs.</p>
    <p>“In the new year, I would like to grow as a per­son, set­tle down and start a fam­ily with my girl­friend.</p>
    <p>“I also want to make a greater im­pact on for­mer of­fend­ers try­ing to get bet­ter, and take up more vol­un­teer work to give back to the com­mu­nity.”</p>
