    <p>Sin­ga­pore Cricket As­so­ci­a­tion (SCA) pres­i­dent Mah­mood Gaznavi wel­comed 2021 with mixed emo­tions.</p>
    <p>There was joy when the na­tional team earned pro­mo­tion to the 16-team global qual­i­fiers for the T20 World Cup in 2022 af­ter claim­ing the scalps of higher-ranked sides Scot­land and Zim­babwe last year – a feat that saw them climb to No. 20 in the world rank­ings.</p>
    <p>But there was also un­cer­tainty and doubt, as gnaw­ing at the back of Gaznavi’s mind is the worry that the team will be ham­pered in their aim to qual­ify for a first-ever World Cup if they con­tinue with­out a ded­i­cated train­ing ground.</p>
    <p>The yearly lease of Kal­lang Cricket Field, where the SCA had called home since 1995, was not re­newed by Sport Sin­ga­pore (SportSG) in De­cem­ber 2015 as it was ear­marked for re­de­vel­op­ment. As a re­sult, the team had to re­sort to trav­el­ling across the Cause­way to train in Jo­hor Baru be­cause of the ab­sence of a ded­i­cated cricket fa­cil­ity here.</p>
    <p>Gaznavi, who has been Sin­ga­pore’s cricket chief since 2015, told The Straits Times: “We can say (lo­cal) cricket is re­silient. In spite of these set­backs we have worked hard and achieved re­sults.</p>
    <p>“But there is only so much of a jour­ney we can make with this dis­ad­van­tage. And we are at a point where, if this dis­ad­van­tage con­tin­ues, we will slip back and not ad­vance.”</p>
    <p>A ded­i­cated cricket ground would be vi­tal for the SCA to im­prove the na­tional team’s stand­ing and run devel­op­ment pro­grammes au­tonomously, he said. A per­ma­nent venue would also give the team a home ground ad­van­tage against vis­it­ing teams, which can be de­ci­sive in cricket, he noted.</p>
    <p>He said that in 2015 “an ex­pec­ta­tion was given to SCA” that it would get a new cricket ground around 2020, adding that there has been reg­u­lar com­mu­ni­ca­tion with na­tional agency SportSG on the mat­ter.</p>
    <p>In the mean­time, the na­tional crick­eters have been train­ing at the In­dian As­so­ci­a­tion (IA) at Balestier Road af­ter a five-year agree­ment was struck in mid-2018 to use its field. But the re­la­tion­ship has not been har­mo­nious.</p>
    <p>Gaznavi ad­mit­ted the SCA-IA ar­range­ment “hasn’t al­ways been a happy mar­riage” partly be­cause the field is a shared fa­cil­ity – other sports such as foot­ball and hockey are played there – and also be­cause SCA can use the ground only af­ter 6.30pm.</p>
    <p>When asked about the dif­fer­ences be­tween the two par­ties, Gaznavi said: “There have been is­sues, and I can’t say there have been no kinks that re­quired iron­ing, but they were largely ironed out.</p>
    <p>“Ob­vi­ously IA has de­mands on the ground, and so has cricket. And those de­mands don’t al­ways end up be­ing re­solved be­cause the de­mands can be mu­tu­ally ex­clu­sive.”</p>
    <p>Gaznavi said SCA would ide­ally like to have in­door and out­door fa­cil­i­ties and a gym at its new home, but would pri­ori­tise what is needed based on re­sources af­forded.</p>
    <p>The as­so­ci­a­tion has no pref­er­ence when it comes to lo­ca­tion “as long as there is space”, he said.</p>
    <p>But SCA may have to bide its time for an­other two years. Re­spond­ing to queries from ST, a SportSG spokesman said: “SportSG is work­ing with rel­e­vant stake­hold­ers in iden­ti­fy­ing and se­cur­ing a per­ma­nent ground for the na­tional team.</p>
    <p>“In the mean­time, SCA will con­tinue to use the field at (IA) un­til 2023.”</p>
    <p>SportSG has pro­vided sup­port to im­prove the con­di­tion of the field for use by SCA, in­clud­ing the in­stal­la­tion of floodlight­s, the spokesman added. “Any re­quest for ad­di­tional sup­port will be sub­ject to a re­view of SCA’s de­tailed preparatio­n plans and goals for the T20 World Cup qual­i­fiers.”</p>
    <p>The spokesman also said that SportSG sup­ports na­tional sports as­so­ci­a­tions’ mu­tu­ally agreed multi-year sports plans, which in­clude de­tailed per­for­mance plans and tar­gets, not­ing that SCA re­ceives an an­nual grant for its pro­grammes and ini­tia­tives, in­clud­ing field rental.</p>
    <p>SCA re­ceived just un­der $1.4 mil­lion in gov­ern­ment fund­ing in the fi­nan­cial year end­ing March 2020, down from $1.94 mil­lion in 2019, and $1.56 mil­lion the year be­fore.</p>
    <p>There is only so much of a jour­ney we can make with this dis­ad­van­tage. And we are at a point where, if this dis­ad­van­tage con­tin­ues, we will slip back ’’ and not ad­vance.</p>
