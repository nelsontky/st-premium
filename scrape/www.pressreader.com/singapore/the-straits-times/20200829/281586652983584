    <p>Ax­ing­ton, the Catal­ist-listed firm linked to the Bel­la­graph Nova Group, which re­cently made a</p>
    <p>£280 mil­lion (S$506 mil­lion) bid for New­cas­tle United Foot­ball Club, has post­poned an ex­tra­or­di­nary gen­eral meet­ing (EGM) that was to have been held on Thurs­day, cit­ing “re­cent me­dia de­vel­op­ments”.</p>
    <p>The Catal­ist-listed firm linked to the Bel­la­graph Nova (BN) Group that re­cently made a £280 mil­lion (S$506 mil­lion) bid for New­cas­tle United Foot­ball Club has post­poned an ex­tra­or­di­nary gen­eral meet­ing (EGM) that was to have been held on Thurs­day.</p>
    <p>“In the light of re­cent de­vel­op­ments in the me­dia, the board (feels) it re­quires more time to con­duct an in­ter­nal as­sess­ment of the cir­cum­stances and the strate­gic plans of the com­pany,” Ax­ing­ton said in a Sin­ga­pore Ex­change (SGX) fil­ing be­fore mar­kets opened yes­ter­day. It added the post­pone­ment would give share­hold­ers “suf­fi­cient time to con­sider the pro­posed res­o­lu­tions”.</p>
    <p>Ax­ing­ton is a pro­fes­sional ad­vi­sory ser­vices firm owned by Sin­ga­porean busi­ness­men and cousins Nel­son Loh and Ter­ence Loh, al­though they are not di­rec­tors. Their busi­ness part­ner, Chi­nese jew­ellery mer­chant Evan­ge­line Shen, is Ax­ing­ton’s non­in­de­pen­dent non-ex­ec­u­tive chair­man. The trio co-founded the newly formed BN Group, which re­cently lodged a takeover bid for English Premier League club New­cas­tle United.</p>
    <p>It later emerged that the group had doc­tored pho­to­graphs of the three founders with for­mer United States pres­i­dent Barack Obama. Other dis­crep­an­cies in its pub­lic­ity ma­te­ri­als also sur­faced.</p>
    <p>The dis­clo­sures prompted the SGX’s reg­u­la­tory arm to call for Ax­ing­ton’s Catal­ist spon­sor, Novus Cor­po­rate Fi­nance, to as­sess the suit­abil­ity of Ms Shen as a direc­tor as well as other di­rec­tors.</p>
    <p>A fur­ther twist came late on Tues­day night when for­mer United States am­bas­sador to Sin­ga­pore Kirk Wa­gar told The Straits Times he had re­signed as an Ax­ing­ton in­de­pen­dent direc­tor, given the re­cent de­vel­op­ments.</p>
    <p>The board an­nounced Mr Wa­gar’s res­ig­na­tion in a sep­a­rate SGX fil­ing yes­ter­day.It added that this was “a re­sult of re­cent rev­e­la­tions... in­volv­ing the BN Group’s mar­ket­ing ma­te­ri­als used to pub­li­cise the group”.</p>
    <p>Novus said Mr Wa­gar “urged more trans­parency”, given the rev­e­la­tions when it held an exit in­ter­view with him on Thurs­day.</p>
    <p>The board also an­nounced it was re­view­ing the com­po­si­tion of mem­bers to com­ply with the Code of Cor­po­rate Gov­er­nance.</p>
    <p>There were at least 200 pub­lic share­hold­ers of Ax­ing­ton as at Aug 18. They held an ag­gre­gate of 42.1 mil­lion shares, rep­re­sent­ing about 22.12 per cent of the com­pany’s to­tal is­sued stock.</p>
    <p>There were few de­tails re­leased yes­ter­day re­gard­ing the post­poned EGM, but the firm did note that not all the res­o­lu­tions to be tabled at the post­poned EGM will be the same as those that had been set for Thurs­day’s meet­ing.</p>
    <p>There were few de­tails re­leased yes­ter­day re­gard­ing the post­poned EGM, but the firm did note that not all the res­o­lu­tions to be tabled at the post­poned EGM will be the same as those that had been set for Thurs­day’s meet­ing.</p>
    <p>That EGM was to ap­prove a name change from Ax­ing­ton to NETX and to change its core busi­ness from pro­fes­sional ad­vi­sory ser­vices to pro­vid­ing med­i­cal and con­sumer well­ness ser­vices and in­vest­ments in med­i­cal tech­nol­ogy, ro­bot­ics and ar­ti­fi­cial in­tel­li­gence tech­nol­ogy.</p>
    <p>Ax­ing­ton also pro­posed to ac­quire Malaysian med­i­cal equip­ment and med­i­cal aes­thet­ics products dis­trib­u­tor Vesta Apex Trad­ing for $12 mil­lion – $6 mil­lion in cash and the is­suance of around 33.3 mil­lion Ax­ing­ton shares at 18 cents apiece.</p>
    <p>Share­hold­ers were to have voted on this at the Thurs­day EGM.</p>
    <p>De­tails on the post­poned meet­ing will be sent to share­hold­ers.</p>
    <p>Ax­ing­ton shares have see-sawed in the past week since news broke on Aug 17 of its New­cas­tle United takeover bid. They jumped as much as 20.5 per cent to 26.5 cents on Aug 19, be­fore clos­ing at a one-year high of 23 cents.</p>
    <p>But af­ter Reuters broke the news of BN Group ad­mit­ting to doc­tor­ing pho­tos in its pub­lic­ity ma­te­ri­als, the stock nose­dived.</p>
    <p>It plunged as much as 22 per cent on Mon­day be­fore clos­ing down 2.2 per cent for the day, only to re­sume its fall on Tues­day, when it dropped nearly 14 per cent to 19 cents – its last traded level be­fore the trad­ing halt on Wed­nes­day.</p>
