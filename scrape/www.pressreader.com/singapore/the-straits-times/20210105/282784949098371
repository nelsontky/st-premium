    <p>• Af­ter 18 months of mar­riage, ac­tress Zoe Kravitz, 32, is call­ing it quits.</p>
    <p>The daugh­ter of singer Lenny Kravitz and ac­tress Lisa Bonet filed for di­vorce from ac­tor Karl Glus­man, 32, on Dec 23 last year.</p>
    <p>The show-busi­ness cou­ple, who met in Oc­to­ber 2016, tied the knot in June 2019 in a star-stud­ded wed­ding held at her fa­ther’s Paris man­sion.</p>
    <p>In an in­ter­view in May last year on the Arm­chair Ex­pert pod­cast, she pro­claimed that he was “The One”.</p>
    <p>The Big Lit­tle Lies star added: “There’s this con­nec­tion where it’s like we’ve al­ways known each other, we’ve al­ways lived to­gether.”</p>
    <p>Just six months ago, on their first an­niver­sary, she had shared a dreamy black-and-white photo from their wed­ding on In­sta­gram with just two words: “One year.”</p>
    <p>On that same an­niver­sary, her hus­band had gushed on the so­cial me­dia plat­form: “One year. Not the year we ex­pected... but I feel like if we can make it through this, we can take on any­thing.”</p>
    <p>“I love you. More than any­thing,” he said, call­ing her his best friend.</p>
    <p>He added: “And I’ll do any­thing and ev­ery­thing for you un­til the day I die.”</p>
    <p>Kravitz, who will ap­pear as Cat­woman in the up­com­ing Bat­man movie with Robert Pat­tin­son, spoke about her mar­riage in an in­ter­view with Va­ri­ety last June.</p>
    <p>“I’m mar­ried, and mak­ing less bad choices — I would like to think,” she said.</p>
    <p>She also added: “You know, life is an on­go­ing strug­gle, so of course, there’s al­ways work to be done. But there’s that first step where it’s like, I’m an adult.”</p>
    <p>Or, as her fa­ther croons in one of his big­gest hits: “It ain’t over till it’s over.”</p>
