    <p>Mankind may be whit­tling away at na­ture but a new study has found that there may be some hope yet for man­groves – crit­i­cal habi­tats that can keep large amounts of car­bon out of the at­mos­phere.</p>
    <p>The study, which was led by re­searchers in Sin­ga­pore, found that while global man­grove area had shrunk over the 20-year study pe­riod from 1996, about a quar­ter of the losses had been off­set by the re­growth of man­groves due to hu­man or nat­u­ral re­for­esta­tion.</p>
    <p>More­over, the re­searchers also found that even when man­groves are cleared for agri­cul­ture or aqua­cul­ture, the land on which they once stood may not im­me­di­ately relin­quish its hold of the stored car­bon.</p>
    <p>This is be­cause man­groves store most of their car­bon un­der­ground, and not just in tree biomass such as in the trunks, roots and leaves. So even when the trees are felled in man­groves, the soil can re­tain some of the car­bon.</p>
    <p>In fact, as lit­tle as 25 per cent of the car­bon stored in tree biomass and soil car­bon may be lost fol­low­ing man­grove de­for­esta­tion, the authors noted in the study which was pub­lished last month in sci­en­tific jour­nal Na­ture Com­mu­ni­ca­tions.</p>
    <p>Lead author Daniel Richards, a prin­ci­pal in­ves­ti­ga­tor at Sin­ga­pore-ETH Cen­tre, told The Straits Times that while there had been ear­lier stud­ies done on the rate of man­grove de­for­esta­tion glob­ally, the lat­est pa­per took into ac­count re­growth and ex­pan­sion of these habi­tats.</p>
    <p>“These pro­cesses are likely to have ac­cu­mu­lated sig­nif­i­cant stocks of car­bon,” said Dr Richards.</p>
    <p>Not­ing that the study also ac­counted for the car­bon re­main­ing in the soil af­ter de­for­esta­tion, he added: “If we as­sume that all man­grove car­bon is lost fol­low­ing de­for­esta­tion, we will over­es­ti­mate the losses in man­grove car­bon stocks.”</p>
    <p>These find­ings, say the authors, would have im­pli­ca­tions for cli­mate poli­cies around the world.</p>
    <p>IM­PLI­CA­TIONS</p>
    <p>It could, for one thing, af­fect how car­bon cred­its are cal­cu­lated, said the study’s co-author, Dr Ben­jamin Thomp­son from Monash Univer­sity in Aus­tralia.</p>
    <p>Car­bon cred­its are of­fered for sale by de­vel­op­ers of car­bon diox­ide emis­sion re­duc­tion projects around the world, such as re­new­able en­ergy or for­est con­ser­va­tion projects.</p>
    <p>These cred­its are then pur­chased by other coun­tries or com­pa­nies as a way to “off­set” their own emis­sions.</p>
    <p>In this con­text, car­bon diox­ide be­comes a univer­sal cur­rency – one that can be traded be­tween those who pro­duce too much (emit­ters), and those who are help­ing to re­duce the amount of the heat-trap­ping gas in the at­mos­phere (de­vel­op­ers of emis­sions re­duc­tion projects).</p>
    <p>The find­ings sug­gest that the amount of car­bon that would be cred­itable from a hectare of con­served man­grove for­est could be less than what was pre­vi­ously ex­pected.</p>
    <p>Dr Thomp­son said: “This is be­cause you can­not gen­er­ate car­bon cred­its from car­bon that would not have been re­leased fol­low­ing con­ver­sion.”</p>
    <p>Sim­i­larly, man­groves that ex­pand nat­u­rally with­out any direct hu­man in­ter­ven­tion would also not be el­i­gi­ble for such ac­count­ing ini­tia­tives, he added.</p>
    <p>“This is be­cause these events would not have been ‘ad­di­tional’ to what would have oc­curred any­way,” he said.</p>
    <p>In cli­mate dis­course, mak­ing clear that car­bon cred­its meet this “ad­di­tion­al­ity” re­quire­ment en­sures that the re­duced emis­sions are en­tirely due to projects de­vel­oped for that spe­cific pur­pose.</p>
    <p>NA­TURE-BASED SO­LU­TION</p>
    <p>Man­groves are also con­sid­ered at­trac­tive na­ture-based solutions for their abil­ity to re­claim land from the sea, said Na­tional Univer­sity of Sin­ga­pore tree sci­en­tist Lahiru Wi­jedasa, who was also in­volved in the study.</p>
    <p>The com­plex root sys­tems of man­grove trees trap sed­i­ment, which can, to an ex­tent, help them keep pace with sea-level rise.</p>
    <p>Said Dr Lahiru: “The man­grove ar­eas to­day would be sea, if not for the habi­tat.”</p>
    <p>Man­groves can also store more car­bon com­pared with many other ecosys­tems, such as trop­i­cal rain­forests, mainly be­cause of their wa­ter-logged en­vi­ron­ment.</p>
    <p>The leaves of man­grove plants take in car­bon diox­ide through the process of pho­to­syn­the­sis.</p>
    <p>When leaves and other tree de­bris fall off, they de­com­pose slowly be­cause they are cov­ered by wa­ter. This re­sults in more car­bon be­ing stored in the soil, re­sult­ing in an over­all net re­moval of car­bon from the at­mos­phere, said Dr Lahiru.</p>
    <p>But this process can be slow, said the study, not­ing that it could take decades for a young man­grove to ac­cu­mu­late as much car­bon as a ma­ture one.</p>
    <p>The study re­in­forces the need to con­serve man­grove forests. “I would stress that the find­ings of our study in no way en­dorse man­grove clear­ing,” said Dr Thomp­son.</p>
    <p>While the study did find that less car­bon is re­leased fol­low­ing man­grove con­ver­sion, it did not mean that no car­bon was re­leased.</p>
    <p>“A size­able amount of car­bon will still be re­leased to the at­mos­phere, and de­for­esta­tion will also re­move the po­ten­tial of the trees to con­tinue to re­move car­bon diox­ide,” he said.</p>
    <p>More­over, man­groves pro­vide many other ser­vices for coastal com­mu­ni­ties, help­ing to sup­port fish­eries and pro­tect­ing the coastline from ero­sion, he added.</p>
    <p>Man­grove ex­pert Daniel Mur­di­yarso, who was not in­volved in the study, said he had made sim­i­lar ob­ser­va­tions in a pa­per which is now un­der­go­ing re­view ahead of pub­li­ca­tion in a sci­en­tific jour­nal.</p>
    <p>“Above-ground biomass re­moval ac­counts for only 20 per cent of the to­tal ecosys­tem car­bon stock as most car­bon stock from man­groves is stored in the soil,” said Dr Mur­di­yarso, a prin­ci­pal sci­en­tist at the Cen­tre for In­ter­na­tional Forestry Re­search based in Bo­gor, In­done­sia.</p>
    <p>He said re­for­esta­tion could help im­prove car­bon stock across all for­est habi­tats. How­ever, man­grove re­for­esta­tion has to be more nu­anced due to their unique con­di­tions.</p>
    <p>Last Oc­to­ber, then Min­is­ter for the En­vi­ron­ment and Wa­ter Re­sources Masagos Zulk­i­fli said Sin­ga­pore will look to ac­tively re­store its man­grove ar­eas to buf­fer against the threat of ris­ing sea lev­els.</p>
    <p>And last month, the Na­tional Parks Board an­nounced that more than 400ha of wet­lands, marshes, na­ture parks and eco-cor­ri­dors along the north­ern coast have col­lec­tively be­come Sin­ga­pore’s se­cond na­ture park net­work.</p>
