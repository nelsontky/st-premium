    <p>SYD­NEY • Bain Cap­i­tal’s res­ur­rec­tion of col­lapsed air­line Vir­gin Aus­tralia Holdings faces mount­ing le­gal op­po­si­tion as bond hold­ers rally to de­rail the takeover and sal­vage some of their debt.</p>
    <p>What started weeks ago as a long-shot chal­lenge to Bain’s deal from two little-known in­vestors in Asia has at­tracted the big­gest names in finance.</p>
    <p>Now, UBS Group, Deutsche Bank and other cred­i­tors hold­ing A$800 mil­lion (S$787 mil­lion) worth of Vir­gin Aus­tralia bonds sup­port a plan to mus­cle out Bain and res­cue the air­line them­selves, ac­cord­ing to court fil­ings.</p>
    <p>Vir­gin Aus­tralia crum­bled in April ow­ing A$6.8 bil­lion, and ad­min­is­tra­tors at Deloitte fast­tracked a sale to Bain be­fore the air­line’s cash ran out.</p>
    <p>The pri­vate eq­uity firm plans to cut a third of the work­force and scale back the fleet, but it has not said how much cred­i­tors will re­ceive.</p>
    <p>The stand-off shows that re­cov­er­ies in one of the pan­demic’s hard­est-hit in­dus­tries risk de­lay or even fail­ure once cred­i­tors start pick­ing through the re­mains.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, Aus­tralia’s fed­eral court was to hear the bond holder group’s re­quest to have Vir­gin Aus­tralia’s cred­i­tors vote on any of­fer, not just Bain’s.</p>
    <p>The bond hold­ers are propos­ing swap­ping their debt for eq­uity and in­ject­ing fresh funds into a re­born air­line. In the best scenario, they would claw back two-thirds of their orig­i­nal in­vest­ment. The le­gal bid is led by Broad Peak In­vest­ment Ad­vis­ers and Tor In­vest­ment Man­age­ment (Hong Kong), which to­gether hold A$300 mil­lion worth of Vir­gin Aus­tralia notes.</p>
    <p>The Fed­eral Court in Syd­ney last month said Deloitte’s “preference for one pro­posal does not jus­tify the ex­clu­sion of all other pro­pos­als from con­sid­er­a­tion by the cred­i­tors”.</p>
    <p>But Deloitte has said the sale to Bain is bind­ing and no other of­fer can be con­sid­ered or rec­om­mended to cred­i­tors, who are due to vote on the deal on Sept 4.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to Bain, the bond holder group’s pro­posal is “not cred­i­ble, nor ca­pa­ble of pro­gress­ing”. In a state­ment, Bain ac­cused Broad Peak and Tor of “try­ing to frus­trate the ad­min­is­tra­tion process by cre­at­ing as much noise and in­ter­fer­ence as pos­si­ble”.</p>
    <p>While the pro­posal from Broad Peak and Tor would see Vir­gin listed in Aus­tralia, the firms have left room for a ne­go­ti­ated set­tle­ment with Bain.</p>
    <p>“We are sure bond hold­ers and other cred­i­tors would wel­come a se­ri­ous, good faith dis­cus­sion with Bain Cap­i­tal to struc­ture a so­lu­tion that pro­vides un­se­cured cred­i­tors the value that’s right­fully due to them,” the two firms said in a joint state­ment.</p>
