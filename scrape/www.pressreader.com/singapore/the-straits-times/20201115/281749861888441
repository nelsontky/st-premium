    <p>DOC­TORS WITH­OUT BOR­DERS, on a ship­wreck off the Libyan coast, where mi­grants, mostly from sub-Sa­ha­ran Africa, per­ished.</p>
    <p>•</p>
    <p>Thou­sands of peo­ple have fled their homes in Viet­nam as Typhoon Vamco bar­relled to­wards the coun­try’s cen­tral re­gions that have al­ready been pum­melled by weeks of suc­ces­sive storms.</p>
    <p>Air­ports have been shut, beaches closed and a fish­ing ban put in place, as the coun­try braces it­self for winds of up to 100kmh when the typhoon makes land­fall to­day, likely close to Hue.</p>
    <p>Thou­sands of peo­ple have been evac­u­ated from their homes in four cen­tral prov­inces, ac­cord­ing to the disas­ter man­age­ment au­thor­ity yes­ter­day, while state me­dia said hun­dreds of thou­sands more may have to flee.</p>
    <p>A se­ries of storms have hit cen­tral Viet­nam over the past six weeks, caus­ing flood­ing and land­slides that have killed at least 159 peo­ple, the au­thor­i­ties said, while 70 oth­ers are miss­ing.</p>
    <p>The se­vere weather has also dam­aged or de­stroyed more than 400,000 homes, ac­cord­ing to the In­ter­na­tional Fed­er­a­tion of Red Cross and Red Cres­cent So­ci­eties.</p>
    <p>Roads and bridges have been washed away, power sup­plies dis­rupted, and cru­cial food crops de­stroyed, leav­ing at least 150,000 peo­ple at im­me­di­ate risk of food short­ages, it added.</p>
    <p>“There has been no respite for more than eight mil­lion peo­ple liv­ing in cen­tral Viet­nam,” said Viet­nam Red Cross So­ci­ety pres­i­dent Nguyen Thi Xuan Thu.</p>
    <p>“Each time they start re­build­ing their lives and liveli­hoods, they are pum­melled by yet an­other storm.”</p>
    <p>Typhoon Vamco has al­ready caused dev­as­ta­tion in the Philip­pines. Emer­gency re­sponse teams were dis­patched yes­ter­day to the north-eastern re­gions, where more than 340,000 peo­ple have been af­fected by se­vere flood­ing fol­low­ing Vamco that killed at least 33 peo­ple across the coun­try, disas­ter agen­cies said.</p>
    <p>Twenty of the deaths were recorded in the prov­inces of Ca­gayan, Is­abela and Nueva Viz­caya on Lu­zon is­land, which have be­come the fo­cus of res­cue ef­forts.</p>
    <p>Ca­gayan gov­er­nor Manuel Mamba said nine peo­ple per­ished when mas­sive floods and Vamco hit the prov­ince ear­lier last week. Among the vic­tims was a res­cue worker who was elec­tro­cuted.</p>
    <p>“No typhoon sig­nal was raised in Ca­gayan due to Typhoon Ulysses, but the wa­ter dumped by the typhoon in Is­abela, Quirino, Nueva Viz­caya, Kalinga and Ifu­gao flowed to our prov­ince,” said Mr Mamba, us­ing the lo­cal name of Vamco.</p>
    <p>Hun­dreds of peo­ple were trapped on rooftops in the hard­est</p>
    <p>hit ar­eas along the Ca­gayan River, with res­cuers un­able to reach them due to the strong cur­rent, said the spokesman for the re­gional Of­fice of Civil De­fence.</p>
    <p>Vast swathes of the re­gion were un­der wa­ter in what of­fi­cials have de­scribed as the worst flood­ing in liv­ing mem­ory.</p>
    <p>The re­lease of wa­ter from Ma­gat dam in Lu­zon, home to Manila, has</p>
    <p>ex­ac­er­bated the im­pact. The dam was forced to open seven gates to re­lease wa­ter after reach­ing the spilling level brought about by rain dumped by the typhoon.</p>
    <p>Philip­pine Pres­i­dent Ro­drigo Duterte yes­ter­day or­dered the cre­ation of an in­ter-agency task force to stream­line the gov­ern­ment’s re­sponse to re­gions hit by Vamco.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, China’s na­tional ob</p>
    <p>Num­ber of peo­ple in north-east Philip­pines af­fected by Typhoon Vamco.</p>
    <p>ser­va­tory yes­ter­day re­newed a blue alert for Vamco, which is ex­pected to bring down­pours and strong winds to parts of the coun­try’s south­ern coastal ar­eas, forc­ing the prov­ince of Hainan to sus­pend all ferry ser­vices in the Qiongzhou Strait.</p>
