    <p>Re­gional sales di­rec­tor Den­nis Tan and his seven-year-old son Ethan are seek­ing healthy out­door bond­ing as well as new places dur­ing the OCBC Cy­cle Vir­tual Ride. They are among 4,700 riders tak­ing part in the sold-out event in Novem­ber. Al­most 70 per cent of the par­tic­i­pants are sign­ing up for the first time, an in­crease from about 40 per cent in pre­vi­ous edi­tions.</p>
    <p>With most ac­tiv­i­ties can­celled or con­ducted from home be­cause of the coro­n­avirus pan­demic, Den­nis Tan was look­ing for out­door ac­tiv­i­ties to keep his seven-year-old son Ethan en­ter­tained and en­gaged.</p>
    <p>“He’s a very ac­tive boy with tons of en­ergy so we didn’t want him to be cooped up at home too much. Rather than the rou­tine of go­ing to school, en­rich­ment classes, then home, we wanted to try to get him out­doors more,” said the re­gional sales di­rec­tor at a cy­ber­se­cu­rity firm.</p>
    <p>So when the chance to join the OCBC Cy­cle 2020 Vir­tual Ride arose, he signed him­self up for the 23km The Straits Times VR and Ethan for the 5km Mighty Savers Kids VR.</p>
    <p>“I like that we can do this at our own time and pace, so we de­cided to give it a shot and burn some calo­ries,” said Tan, 39, a first-time par­tic­i­pant of the OCBC Cy­cle.</p>
    <p>“One of the most im­por­tant things is to in­stil a sense of dis­ci­pline in him, be­cause you have to cy­cle in an or­derly man­ner. Be­sides that, I hope to show him more of Sin­ga­pore and that it’s pretty con­nected.</p>
    <p>“Hope­fully, cy­cling be­comes a habit or hobby for him be­cause it’s an­other form of trans­porta­tion he can use to ex­plore new places in Sin­ga­pore.”</p>
    <p>Ethan is ex­cited about hav­ing an­other op­por­tu­nity to spend time with his fa­ther. They usu­ally play Mario Kart and board games like Mo­nop­oly to­gether.</p>
    <p>The Pasir Ris Pri­mary School pupil said: “I’m very ex­cited. I like cy­cling be­cause I can ex­er­cise and my feet won’t get blis­ters, un­like run­ning when you some­times get blis­ters.</p>
    <p>“I’m happy to cy­cle with my dad be­cause it’s bond­ing and we can cel­e­brate com­plet­ing the chal­lenge to­gether.</p>
    <p>“I pre­fer cy­cling to play­ing board games be­cause board games teach you some­thing but cy­cling teaches you way more things. Board games are about luck but this is about hard work and sweat­ing.”</p>
    <p>Tan and Ethan will be among 4,700 riders tak­ing part in the sold­out event from Nov 1-15. Like the fa­ther and son duo, al­most 70 per cent of the par­tic­i­pants are sign­ing up for the first time, an in­crease from about 40 per cent in pre­vi­ous edi­tions. All slots were snapped up one month be­fore or­gan­is­ers planned to close regis­tra­tion.</p>
    <p>The orig­i­nal OCBC Cy­cle, which usu­ally has about 7,000 par­tic­i­pants, had been post­poned from May 9-10 to an un­spec­i­fied date. It was later can­celled and con­verted to a free vir­tual event.</p>
    <p>Be­sides the 23km ride, the third cat­e­gory of the event is the 42km Sportive VR while chil­dren aged two to five will cy­cle 800m in the Mighty Savers Kids VR.</p>
    <p>Par­tic­i­pants can record the dis­tance in each cat­e­gory over a max­i­mum of four sep­a­rate rides. They are re­quired to sub­mit pho­tos of them­selves be­fore and af­ter their rides, which can be done any­where in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>Koh Ching Ching, OCBC Bank’s head of group brand and com­mu­ni­ca­tions, said: “Be­ing able to con­tinue to cre­ate the op­por­tu­nity for friends and fam­i­lies to come to­gether to have fun and ex­er­cise – in small groups this year, given the cur­rent sit­u­a­tion – has al­ways been a key ob­jec­tive of OCBC Cy­cle.</p>
    <p>“While it is a pity we are not able to bring the more than 6,000 cy­clists to­gether in one place be­cause of the Covid-19 out­break, the dif­fer­ent for­mat that cir­cum­stances forced us to come up with has been well re­ceived.</p>
    <p>“Our team is really look­ing for­ward to all the pic­tures and self­ies that the cy­clists will send us over the two event weeks.”</p>
