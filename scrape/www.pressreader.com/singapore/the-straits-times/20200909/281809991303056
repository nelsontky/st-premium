    <p>Hong Kong’s gov­ern­ment an­nounced yes­ter­day a cau­tious eas­ing of some so­cial dis­tanc­ing rules, as the third coro­n­avirus wave sta­bilises, with group gath­er­ings to be capped at four and some busi­nesses to re­open.</p>
    <p>Bar­ring any spike in cases, Sec­re­tary for Food and Health Sophia Chan said, the limit im­posed on eater­ies will be raised for a week from Fri­day to four peo­ple a ta­ble, up from the cur­rent two pa­trons.</p>
    <p>Ex­ist­ing rules, in­clud­ing ta­bles spaced at least 1.5m apart, as well as man­dat­ing restau­rants to cap seat­ing at 50 per cent, will stay.</p>
    <p>Sports premises, amuse­ment game cen­tres and places of pub­lic en­ter­tain­ment will re­open, Pro­fes­sor Chan said, adding that club houses, karaoke lounges, pools and pubs will be con­sid­ered in the next phase of rules re­lax­ation.</p>
    <p>Sec­re­tary for Com­merce and Eco­nomic Devel­op­ment Ed­ward Yau, who was at the brief­ing, said if con­di­tions pre­vail, re­stric­tions on two theme parks – Dis­ney­land and Ocean Park – and con­ven­tion ex­hi­bi­tion cen­tres, which are now closed, will be lifted on Sept 18.</p>
    <p>He added that Hong Kong has ini­ti­ated bi­lat­eral talks on travel ar­range­ments with 11 ju­ris­dic­tions, in­clud­ing Ja­pan and Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>Prof Chan said the free mass Covid-19 test­ing pro­gramme that started on Sept 1 will be ex­tended to Fri­day, so as to iden­tify those who are asymp­to­matic. Over 1.2 mil­lion peo­ple have booked ap­point­ments on­line to be tested and re­sults of more than 930,000 have been up­loaded to the sys­tem.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, six new con­firmed cases were added, of which three were lo­cal in­fec­tions, bring­ing the to­tal tally to 4,895, with 98 deaths.</p>
