    <p>With news that the state of South Aus­tralia will soon open its bor­ders to in­ter­na­tional stu­dents, Sin­ga­porean stu­dents are hop­ing that the rest of Aus­tralia will soon fol­low suit and al­low those pur­su­ing higher ed­u­ca­tion in the coun­try to re­turn.</p>
    <p>Last week, Aus­tralia’s Min­is­ter for Trade, Tourism and In­vest­ment Si­mon Birm­ing­ham said South Aus­tralia will al­low 300 in­ter­na­tional stu­dents – mainly from China, Hong Kong, Ja­pan and Sin­ga­pore – to re­turn to the state in a pi­lot to restart the ail­ing ed­u­ca­tion sec­tor.</p>
    <p>The sec­tor ac­counts for more than $20 billion in rev­enue and was the third most valu­able ex­port after coal and iron ore be­fore the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>The min­is­ter said the pi­lot will al­low the au­thor­i­ties in Aus­tralia to test if it can be ap­plied across the coun­try. From next month, higher ed­u­ca­tion stu­dents can fly from Sin­ga­pore to Ade­laide, a city which has ef­fec­tively curbed the spread of the coro­n­avirus.</p>
    <p>There is no in­di­ca­tion from Aus­tralia if these stu­dents will need Covid-19 test­ing or a pe­riod of quar­an­tine in Sin­ga­pore be­fore they leave for Ade­laide.</p>
    <p>But once they ar­rive in the city, they will be quar­an­tined for 14 days in ho­tels, which will be paid for by the uni­ver­si­ties.</p>
    <p>The Univer­sity of Ade­laide’s den­tistry pro­gramme is among sev­eral in the coun­try that Sin­ga­pore­ans en­rol in.</p>
    <p>It is un­clear how many Sin­ga­pore­ans are cur­rently en­rolled in Aus­tralian uni­ver­si­ties but the last re­port in 2016 showed there were about 8,000.</p>
    <p>Many in­ter­na­tional stu­dents left Aus­tralia as the pan­demic spread glob­ally. Go­ing back to their schools has proved dif­fi­cult with coun­tries keep­ing their bor­ders shut, with few ex­cep­tions.</p>
    <p>Ms Hazel Tan, who is do­ing a master’s in biomed­i­cal science at the Univer­sity of Western Aus­tralia, chose to re­main in Perth as she was not sure when she would be al­lowed back.</p>
    <p>Les­sons were moved on­line in March be­fore some face-to-face ses­sions were in­tro­duced from last month, with safe dis­tanc­ing mea­sures in place. The 22-year-old said she has at least five friends who de­cided to re­turn to Sin­ga­pore but have not been al­lowed to get back to Aus­tralia.</p>
    <p>“Western Aus­tralia made it very clear they wouldn’t re­open their bor­ders, so you can leave, but it’s not guar­an­teed that you can come back even if you have a stu­dent visa.</p>
    <p>“The univer­sity promised that it will de­liver les­sons on­line for stu­dents who can’t be here, but I can see that the qual­ity is very dif­fer­ent com­pared with phys­i­cal les­sons.”</p>
    <p>Ms Ce­line Choo, 19, an engi­neer­ing stu­dent at the Univer­sity of New South Wales in Syd­ney, is in</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore. She thinks the ear­li­est she will be al­lowed back would be next year.</p>
    <p>“Even if we were al­lowed to re­turn, the univer­sity would need to stag­ger it such that not every­one comes back at once and over­loads the sys­tem,” said Ms Choo, who re­turned in March and has been at­tend­ing classes on­line since.</p>
    <p>If stu­dents are al­lowed to re­turn, she said, those in post­grad­u­ate pro­grammes would be given pri­or­ity, ac­cord­ing to an e-mail she re­ceived from her univer­sity.</p>
    <p>She said she has been mon­i­tor­ing the Covid-19 sit­u­a­tion in Aus­tralia and the risk level –out­side of the state of Vic­to­ria, which has seen a surge in cases – seems to be sim­i­lar to Sin­ga­pore’s.</p>
    <p>“If I could go back, I def­i­nitely would... It’s just that it doesn’t seem it will be an op­tion any time soon.”</p>
    <p>Mean­while, there are ef­forts to al­low for­eign stu­dents back into Sin­ga­pore as well, The Sunday</p>
    <p>Times un­der­stands.</p>
    <p>The move is be­ing made along­side broader mea­sures to es­tab­lish green lanes with coun­tries for busi­ness, diplo­matic and other essen­tial travel.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore and Malaysia have re­sumed essen­tial busi­ness and of­fi­cial travel.</p>
    <p>From Sept 1, the Repub­lic will also al­low gen­eral travel to Brunei and New Zealand, as well as for stu­dents re­turn­ing over­seas for their stud­ies.</p>
    <p>Ed­u­ca­tion Min­is­ter Lawrence Wong said on Fri­day that stu­dents study­ing over­seas at in­sti­tu­tions where dis­tance learn­ing is not of­fered as an op­tion by the school will be al­lowed to travel.</p>
    <p>“Many for­eign ed­u­ca­tion in­sti­tu­tions are re­sum­ing their terms quite soon... There are stu­dents based in Sin­ga­pore who are full­time stu­dents and who have to go back to school in these var­i­ous in­sti­tu­tions,” Mr Wong said.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­porean stu­dents en­rolled in uni­ver­si­ties out­side Aus­tralia are weigh­ing the trade-offs be­tween safety, fi­nan­cial costs and dis­rup­tion to their ed­u­ca­tion be­fore de­cid­ing on their next step.</p>
    <p>Ms Grace Chew, 20, who will be start­ing her fi­nal year at Univer­sity Col­lege Lon­don next month, said she has still not de­cided if she will re­turn to Lon­don or con­tinue with re­mote learn­ing.</p>
    <p>But she does hope to even­tu­ally re­sume phys­i­cal les­sons.</p>
    <p>“Pub­lic health and safety are most im­por­tant. With­out that, I would not be able to study at ease.</p>
    <p>“I be­lieve the univer­sity is do­ing the best it can in en­forc­ing strict safe dis­tanc­ing mea­sures, so I am very thank­ful.</p>
    <p>“There are of course dis­rup­tions to our ed­u­ca­tion but it is what it is,” said the law stu­dent.</p>
    <p>She is hop­ing pi­lots sim­i­lar to South Aus­tralia’s will be ini­ti­ated in Lon­don to ease in­ter­na­tional stu­dents’ re­turn.</p>
    <p>She said: “Liv­ing in Lon­don is ex­pen­sive, so (hav­ing quar­an­tine costs covered) would really be of great help.”</p>
    <p>There are cur­rently an es­ti­mated 19,000 Sin­ga­pore stu­dents en­rolled in uni­ver­si­ties in the United States, Bri­tain and Aus­tralia.</p>
    <p>PHYS­I­CAL LES­SONS COUNT</p>
    <p>The univer­sity promised that it will de­liver les­sons on­line for stu­dents who can’t be here, but I can see that the qual­ity is very dif­fer­ent com­pared with phys­i­cal les­sons. ’’</p>
    <p>MS HAZEL TAN, who is do­ing a master’s in biomed­i­cal science at the Univer­sity of Western Aus­tralia, and who chose to re­main in Perth as she was not sure when she would be al­lowed back.</p>
