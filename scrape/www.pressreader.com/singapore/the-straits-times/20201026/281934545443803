    <p>Only five times in its his­tory has the US had a pres­i­dent who has lost the pop­u­lar vote but won the elec­tion. Mr Don­ald Trump was one of them in 2016. As he seeks to be re-elected, in just over a week from now, opin­ion polls once again show him trail­ing his Demo­cratic ri­val Joe Bi­den, by around 7 points on an av­er­age, although the race in some key swing states is tighter. Un­til the Covid-19 pan­demic struck, Mr Trump’s strong­est case be­fore vot­ers was that he had de­liv­ered on his prom­ise to bol­ster the US economy. The gross do­mes­tic prod­uct was ris­ing, un­em­ploy­ment dip­ping and his pitch to bring back man­u­fac­tur­ing to the US, prin­ci­pally by wag­ing a trade war against China, seemed to have won some sup­port.</p>
    <p>The pan­demic way­laid the economy and cast his lead­er­ship into head­lines as the United States be­came the coun­try with the world’s largest num­ber of Covid-19 cases as well as deaths, last week record­ing the high­est daily count of over 80,000 cases. The shadow of the pan­demic is loom­ing over se­nior cit­i­zens – the group most vul­ner­a­ble to Covid-19 – as well as sub­ur­ban white women who have turned crit­i­cal of Mr Trump’s cri­sis man­age­ment. In bat­tle­ground states like Florida, where se­niors are a de­ci­sive chunk of vot­ers and where Mr Trump cast his own vote last Satur­day, the race is on a ra­zor’s edge. Other states that must fig­ure in a Trump win – like Ari­zona, Iowa, North Carolina, Michi­gan and Wisconsin – are also close con­tests.</p>
    <p>An in­cum­bent pres­i­dent counts on his track record and his bond with the na­tion to do the heavy lift­ing on the cam­paign trail. Mr Trump can do nei­ther with com­plete ease. Fewer Amer­i­cans voted for him than they did for his ri­val Hil­lary Clin­ton in 2016. The some­what love­less mar­riage with the elec­torate was not helped by Mr Trump’s de­ci­sion to con­tinue di­rect­ing his mes­sag­ing to his loyal but rel­a­tively small base of vot­ers. Thus, on racial re­la­tions, one of the prom­i­nent is­sues in this elec­tion, Mr Bi­den ap­par­ently has the ad­van­tage. But on the economy, the sin­gle most im­por­tant is­sue to Amer­i­cans as per polls, some vot­ers have doubts about Mr Bi­den, who is thought to be left of cen­tre and in­vokes fears of heavy reg­u­la­tions that might pun­ish en­ter­prise.</p>
    <p>The most de­ci­sive fac­tor in the con­test could then be turnout. Nearly 50 mil­lion vot­ers have al­ready cast their bal­lots, un­prece­dented in a coun­try that usu­ally reg­is­ters 55 per cent turnout. Some 100 mil­lion more will line up on elec­tion day. Early votes are sup­pos­edly a boon for Mr Bi­den while Mr Trump ex­pects more of the vot­ers who show up on Nov 3 to de­liver for him. For Asia, the elec­tion will have vis­i­ble con­se­quences. A Bi­den win could mean a re­turn to more tra­di­tional ways of en­gag­ing China. Yet, amid the twin threats from the pan­demic and re­ces­sion, who­ever wins will have to tran­scend the mis­trust that is pre­vent­ing an ef­fec­tive global re­sponse.</p>
