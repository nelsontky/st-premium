    <p>In The Flight At­ten­dant, Ka­ley Cuoco plays an air stew­ardess who wakes up in bed with a dead man af­ter a wild, drunken night in Bangkok.</p>
    <p>This is the first tele­vi­sion role for Cuoco since her turn on the megahit sit­com The Big Bang The­ory (2007 to 2019), which made her one of the high­est-paid ac­tresses in Hol­ly­wood.</p>
    <p>And she ini­ti­ated the project through her pro­duc­tion com­pany, which aims to de­velop more in­ter­est­ing roles for women and other un­der­rep­re­sented groups, she says.</p>
    <p>In the eight-episode lim­ited se­ries, a dark comedic thriller de­but­ing on Thursday on HBO Go, hard-par­ty­ing flight at­ten­dant Cassie (Cuoco) wakes up next to a hand­some stranger she spent the night with, only to find him ly­ing in a pool of blood. And she has no mem­ory of what hap­pened.</p>
    <p>It is based on The New York Times’ best-sell­ing novel of the same name by Chris Bo­h­jalian, which Cuoco, 34, op­tioned the screen rights to.</p>
    <p>Chat­ting to the press over a video call from Los An­ge­les, the ac­tress says she had not set out to do some­thing dras­ti­cally dif­fer­ent from her role on The Big Bang The­ory, the long-run­ning sit­com in which she played the neigh­bour to a group of bril­liant but so­cially awk­ward nerds.</p>
    <p>“I didn’t have any goals of, like, ‘I need to get away from this and find the most op­po­site project.’</p>
    <p>“I knew the right thing would come. I just didn’t know what it was. But when I saw The Flight At­ten­dant book and op­tioned it three years ago, I im­me­di­ately thought this would make such good tele­vi­sion and, wow, what a char­ac­ter to sink my teeth into.</p>
    <p>“It just felt like the right move at the right time.”</p>
    <p>She earned nearly US$25 mil­lion (S$33.6 mil­lion) for The Big Bang The­ory in 2018, lead­ing Forbes mag­a­zine to, the fol­low­ing year, name her as the sec­ond high­est­paid ac­tress in the world af­ter Sofia Ver­gara, star of the sit­com Mod­ern Fam­ily (2009 to 2020).</p>
    <p>The Flight At­ten­dant is one of her first ma­jor cred­its as an ex­ec­u­tive pro­ducer, the se­ries hav­ing been de­vel­oped by Yes, Nor­man, her film and tele­vi­sion pro­duc­tion com­pany.</p>
    <p>The other is the adult an­i­mated se­ries Har­ley Quinn, based on the quirky DC Comics su­pervil­lain, whom she also voices on the show. It premiered last year to rave re­views.</p>
    <p>Cuoco is lov­ing her new career path. “As an ac­tress, I do my job, then I see the prod­uct six months or a year later, but all that hap­pens be­tween is where the magic is – the edit­ing, pro­duc­ing and putting stuff to­gether.</p>
    <p>“So, be­ing part of the process from the be­gin­ning was an in­cred­i­ble ex­pe­ri­ence. It was great to be able to have an opin­ion and form this char­ac­ter into what I wanted it to be be­cause I had such a vi­sion for it,” says the star, who has ap­peared in com­edy films such as The Wed­ding Ringer (2015).</p>
    <p>The new se­ries is a much darker shade of com­edy than her pre­vi­ous work, with el­e­ments of crime and psy­cho­log­i­cal thriller thrown into the mix.</p>
    <p>The char­ac­ter, Cassie, is also “a func­tion­ing al­co­holic”, Cuoco says. “This is some­one who drinks all day, ev­ery day, so, in play­ing her, I had to find a level that was a lit­tle manic but also re­al­is­tic so that the au­di­ence would first hate her.</p>
    <p>“Then, you see those deep mo­ments of, ‘This girl is re­ally strug­gling’, and those mo­ments needed to be su­per be­liev­able.”</p>
    <p>Flawed, com­pli­cated fe­male char­ac­ters like these are ex­actly what she wants to bring to the screen as a pro­ducer – a role she is look­ing for­ward to grow­ing.</p>
    <p>“We have a lot of projects I’m pro­duc­ing that I’m not ap­pear­ing in, but am just be­hind the scenes. That’s go­ing to be a big deal in my fu­ture.”</p>
    <p>Cuoco’s goal on that front is noth­ing short of want­ing “to take over the pro­duc­ing world”, she says un­abashedly.</p>
    <p>“I want to tell sto­ries that maybe people haven’t told, about people from all back­grounds, es­pe­cially women, and bring their voices to the fore­front.</p>
    <p>“I feel like I have an op­por­tu­nity to do that and so I’m ex­cited.”</p>
    <p>I had to find a level that was a lit­tle manic but also re­al­is­tic so that the au­di­ence would first hate her. Then, you see those deep mo­ments of, ‘This girl is re­ally strug­gling’, and those mo­ments needed to be su­per be­liev­able.</p>
