    <p>BANGKOK • A ma­jor­ity of Thais do not agree with a gov­ern­ment plan to re­open Thai­land’s bor­ders to for­eign tourists, a sur­vey showed, as the na­tion pre­pared to re­ceive its first group of vis­i­tors in al­most seven months.</p>
    <p>About 57 per cent of re­spon­dents were con­cerned that the re­open­ing would in­crease the risks of coro­n­avirus in­fec­tions and dis­agreed with the plan, ac­cord­ing to the poll con­ducted by the Bangkok-based Na­tional In­sti­tute of De­vel­op­ment Ad­min­is­tra­tion.</p>
    <p>The sur­vey of about 1,300 peo­ple also found that 62 per cent were not con­fi­dent that the gov­ern­ment can avoid a re-emer­gence of Covid-19 once the coun­try re­opens to hol­i­day­mak­ers.</p>
    <p>Last week, the tourism-re­liant na­tion un­veiled plans to ad­mit a lim­ited num­ber of for­eign tourists each month to pro­vide some re­lief to the tourism in­dus­try, which is strug­gling to sur­vive with­out in­ter­na­tional vis­i­tors.</p>
    <p>Prime Min­is­ter Prayut Chan-ocha’s gov­ern­ment is seek­ing a bal­ance be­tween res­cu­ing its tourism sec­tor, which de­rives two-thirds of its rev­enue from for­eign vis­i­tors, and main­tain­ing its good track record of man­ag­ing the virus.</p>
    <p>Thai­land’s re­open­ing plan has faced sev­eral de­lays, partly due to the con­cerns of some lo­cal groups.</p>
    <p>But the gov­ern­ment has pushed ahead with the plan to re­ceive vis­i­tors with a 14-day manda­tory quar­an­tine, al­though tourism busi­nesses said the re­quire­ment would ex­clude most trav­ellers hop­ing to visit the coun­try.</p>
    <p>Even the sup­port­ers of a gov­ern­ment plan to is­sue long-term visas to for­eign­ers said there must be ef­fec­tive mea­sures in place to pre­vent spread of the virus.</p>
    <p>The ran­dom sur­vey was con­ducted last Thurs­day and Fri­day, and has a con­fi­dence level of 97 per cent, the in­sti­tute said.</p>
