    <p>There were eight new coro­n­avirus cases con­firmed yes­ter­day, said the Min­istry of Health (MOH), tak­ing Sin­ga­pore’s to­tal to 58,064.</p>
    <p>There were no cases in the com­mu­nity or work­ers’ dor­mi­to­ries for the fourth con­sec­u­tive day, said MOH.</p>
    <p>The eight were im­ported cases who had been placed on stay­home no­tice on ar­rival in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>Of the eight, three were per­ma­nent res­i­dents who re­turned from In­dia, Bangladesh and the United Arab Emi­rates (UAE).</p>
    <p>The one who re­turned from the UAE was a 47-year-old man who un­der­went a Covid-19 poly­merase chain re­ac­tion test upon re­turn to Sin­ga­pore, and self-iso­lated at home while wait­ing for his test re­sult.</p>
    <p>He was sent to hos­pi­tal af­ter his test came back pos­i­tive the next day.</p>
    <p>An­other two cases were work pass hold­ers who ar­rived from South Korea and the Philip­pines.</p>
    <p>Two work per­mit hold­ers ar­rived from In­done­sia, while the re­main­ing case is a long-term visit pass holder who ar­rived from In­dia.</p>
    <p>MOH also an­nounced that the clus­ter in Toh Guan Dor­mi­tory has been closed as it has not had new cases linked to it for 28 days, or two in­cu­ba­tion pe­ri­ods.</p>
    <p>MOH added that the num­ber of new cases in the com­mu­nity has re­mained low, with a to­tal of one case in the past week, which is cur­rently un­linked.</p>
    <p>With six cases dis­charged yes­ter­day, 57,966 pa­tients have fully re­cov­ered from the dis­ease.</p>
    <p>A to­tal of 34 pa­tients re­main in hos­pi­tal, with none in in­ten­sive care, while 21 are re­cu­per­at­ing in com­mu­nity fa­cil­i­ties.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore has had 28 deaths from Covid-19 com­pli­ca­tions, while 15 who tested pos­i­tive have died of other causes.</p>
