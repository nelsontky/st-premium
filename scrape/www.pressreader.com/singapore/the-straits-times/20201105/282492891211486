    <p>SOUSSE (Tu­nisia) • A Tu­nisian start-up is de­vel­op­ing a 3Dprinted bionic hand, hop­ing the af­ford­able and so­lar-pow­ered pros­thetic will help am­putees and other peo­ple with dis­abil­i­ties across Africa.</p>
    <p>Un­like tra­di­tional pros­the­ses, the ar­ti­fi­cial hand can be cus­tomised for chil­dren and youth, who oth­er­wise re­quire an ex­pen­sive se­ries of re­sized mod­els as they grow up.</p>
    <p>The com­pany, Cure Bion­ics, also has plans to de­velop a video game­like vir­tual re­al­ity sys­tem that helps young­sters learn how to use the ar­ti­fi­cial hand through phys­i­cal ther­apy.</p>
    <p>Mr Mo­hamed Dhaouafi, founder and chief ex­ec­u­tive of Cure Bion­ics, de­signed his first pro­to­type while still an engi­neer­ing stu­dent in his home city Sousse.</p>
    <p>“One team mem­ber had a cousin who was born with­out a hand and whose par­ents couldn’t af­ford a pros­the­sis, es­pe­cially as she was still grow­ing up. So we de­cided to de­sign a hand.”</p>
    <p>Mr Dhaouafi launched his startup in 2017 from his par­ents’ home.</p>
    <p>He pointed to hur­dles in Tu­nisia, where it can be hard or im­pos­si­ble to or­der parts via large on­line sales sites. But by pool­ing money raised through spon­sored com­pe­ti­tions and seed in­vest­ment from a United States com­pany, he was able to re­cruit four young engi­neers.</p>
    <p>They are now fine-tun­ing de­signs, writ­ing code and test­ing the ar­ti­fi­cial hand.</p>
    <p>The de­vice works with sen­sors at­tached to the arm that de­tect mus­cle move­ments, and ar­ti­fi­cial in­tel­li­gence-as­sisted soft­ware that in­ter­prets them to trans­mit in­struc­tions to the dig­its.</p>
    <p>The hand it­self has a wrist that can turn side­ways, a me­chan­i­cal thumb and fin­gers that bend at the joints in re­sponse to the im­pulses.</p>
    <p>To teach young­sters how to use them, Cure Bion­ics has been work­ing on a vir­tual-re­al­ity head­set that “gam­i­fies” the phys­i­cal ther­apy process. “Cur­rently, for re­ha­bil­i­ta­tion, chil­dren are asked to pre­tend to open a jar, for ex­am­ple, with the hand they no longer have,” said Mr Dhaouafi, 28.</p>
    <p>“It takes time to suc­ceed in ac­ti­vat­ing the mus­cles this way. It’s not in­tu­itive, and it’s very bor­ing.”</p>
    <p>In Cure Bion­ics’ ver­sion, the chil­dren climb up build­ings like Spi­der-Man, with a game score to mo­ti­vate them, and a doc­tor can fol­low up on­line from a dis­tance.</p>
    <p>Cure Bion­ics hopes to mar­ket its first bionic hands within a few months, first in Tu­nisia and then else­where in Africa, where over three-quar­ters of peo­ple in need have no ac­cess to them, ac­cord­ing to the World Health Or­gan­i­sa­tion.</p>
    <p>The en­vis­aged price of around US$2,000 (S$2,720) to US$3,000 is sub­stan­tial, but a frac­tion of the cost of bionic pros­the­ses cur­rently im­ported from Europe.</p>
    <p>The bionic hand is made of Le­go­like parts that can be re­placed if dam­aged or to match a child’s phys­i­cal growth.</p>
    <p>Mr Jerry Evans, who heads Nia Tech­nolo­gies, a Cana­dian non­com­mer­cial or­gan­i­sa­tion that helps African hos­pi­tals man­u­fac­ture 3D-printed lower limbs, said: “3D print­ing is still in its early stages... but it is a ma­jor game changer in the field of pros­thet­ics and or­thotics.”</p>
