    <p>LON­DON • Bri­tish law­mak­ers called for a ban on lip fillers and Bo­tox for un­der-18s l ast Fri­day amid con­cerns that re­al­ity TV stars from shows such as Love Is­land (2015 to present) are fuelling a surge in school­girls hav­ing risky fa­cial in­jec­tions.</p>
    <p>They said it was out­ra­geous that chil­dren could legally get cos­metic treat­ments, putting them at risk of in­fec­tions, scar­ring, tis­sue death and even blind­ness.</p>
    <p>Law­mak­ers told of girls com­ing close to hav­ing their lips par­tially am­pu­tated fol­low­ing com­pli­ca­tions, and called for greater reg­u­la­tion of a sec­tor that in­dus­try ex­perts de­scribed as a “free for all”.</p>
    <p>“We must stop the dan­ger­ous and un­nec­es­sary non-med­i­cal pro­ce­dures that can ruin chil­dren’s lives,” said Con­ser­va­tive par­lia­men­tar­ian Laura Trott, who is spear­head­ing a Bill to crim­i­nalise the pro­vi­sion of Bo­tox and fillers to un­der-18s.</p>
    <p>She said one sur­vey sug­gested 100,000 un­der-16s had had cos­metic treat­ments.</p>
    <p>“The ab­sence of a le­gal age limit for Bo­tox and der­mal fillers means any 15-year-old could walk into a shop and get their lips in­jected by some­one with no qual­i­fi­ca­tions what­so­ever,” Ms Trott told Par­lia­ment. “This can­not be al­lowed to con­tinue.”</p>
    <p>Par­lia­men­tar­i­ans blamed the in­flu­ence of so­cial me­dia for the nor­mal­i­sa­tion of cos­metic treat­ments among the young as they voiced sup­port for the Bill.</p>
    <p>Com­plaints of botched treat­ments have sky­rock­eted, ac­cord­ing to Save Face, a Bri­tish reg­is­ter of ac­cred­ited prac­ti­tion­ers which cam­paigns for strong reg­u­la­tion.</p>
    <p>Di­rec­tor Ash­ton Collins said the craze for lip fillers was be­ing driven by so­cial me­dia in­flu­encers and celebritie­s from shows in­clud­ing Love Is­land and Keep­ing Up With The Kar­dashi­ans (2007 to present).</p>
    <p>She said un­scrupu­lous prac­ti­tion­ers were flood­ing so­cial me­dia with un­fea­si­bly cheap of­fers for mul­ti­ple treat­ments, called “Kim Kar­dashian pack­ages” and “Kylie Jen­ner pack­ages”, along­side pic­tures of the celebritie­s.</p>
    <p>“This is so, so dan­ger­ous,” she said. “Girls think these are risk-free treat­ments like get­ting your nails or hair done when, in fact, they are se­ri­ous med­i­cal treat­ments that could cause hor­ri­ble things if they go wrong.”</p>
    <p>Ms Collins said so­cial me­dia fil­ters which make girls look like they have had pro­ce­dures were also en­cour­ag­ing them to get treat­ments so that they looked more like their fil­tered im­ages.</p>
    <p>Save Face re­ceived 45 com­plaints of botched pro­ce­dures on un­der­18s last year, up from nine in 2018.</p>
    <p>The youngest girls were 15 and al­most all had found their treat­ments via so­cial me­dia.</p>
    <p>Over­all, Save Face re­ceived 1,617 com­plaints last year, most re­lat­ing to un­trained and unin­sured prac­ti­tion­ers.</p>
    <p>Reg­u­la­tions in many Euro­pean coun­tries and the United States are far tighter than in Bri­tain, where Ms Collins said any­one could pick up a sy­ringe, watch a YouTube video and set them­selves up in busi­ness.</p>
    <p>Al­though Bo­tox is mostly used by older women, the anti-wrin­kle treat­ment has be­come in­creas­ingly pop­u­lar with very young women who hope it will pre­vent wrin­kles.</p>
