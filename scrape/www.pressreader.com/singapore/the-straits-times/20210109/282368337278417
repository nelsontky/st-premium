    <p>A youth who mo­lested two women while out on bail for out­rag­ing a 12-year-old girl’s mod­esty was or­dered yes­ter­day to un­dergo at least a year’s re­for­ma­tive train­ing.</p>
    <p>This means Ah­mad Harith Wan Razali will be de­tained in a cen­tre and made to fol­low a strict reg­i­men that in­cludes foot drills and coun­selling.</p>
    <p>The 20-year-old Sin­ga­porean pleaded guilty in Novem­ber last year to three mo­lesta­tion charges and one count of in­sult­ing a woman’s mod­esty.</p>
    <p>His vic­tims can­not be named due to a gag or­der to pro­tect their iden­ti­ties.</p>
    <p>Ah­mad had fol­lowed the 12-yearold girl as she was walk­ing home from Eunos MRT sta­tion on Feb 27 last year.</p>
    <p>They en­tered a lift at her block and he stood be­hind the girl. He then squat­ted to peep up her skirt. The girl caught Ah­mad in the act from the mir­rors in the lift. Feel­ing un­com­fort­able, she moved closer to the lift doors.</p>
    <p>Ah­mad then touched the child’s but­tocks twice, and apol­o­gised when she turned to look at him.</p>
    <p>She rushed home when the lift doors opened and told her mother about her or­deal.</p>
    <p>The po­lice were alerted and Ah­mad was charged in a district court on March 3 last year.</p>
    <p>He was later re­leased on bail but re­of­fended soon af­ter.</p>
    <p>On July 8 last year, he mo­lested a 26-year-old woman while they were in a lift.</p>
    <p>He tar­geted a 22-year-old woman the fol­low­ing month, us­ing his mo­bile phone to snap an up­skirt pho­to­graph.</p>
    <p>Three months later on Nov 7, he mo­lested a 28-year-old woman dur­ing a bus ride.</p>
    <p>He had moved to sit di­rectly be­hind her af­ter she went up to the up­per deck of the bus. He then slid his hand through a gap be­tween a win­dow and a seat to touch the woman around her left rib.</p>
    <p>Ah­mad re­tracted his hand and averted his gaze when the woman turned around.</p>
    <p>She left her seat and told the bus driver about the in­ci­dent. A po­lice re­port was made later that day.</p>
    <p>For mo­lest­ing a child be­low 14 years old, an of­fender can be jailed for up to five years and fined or caned.</p>
    <p>For in­sult­ing a woman’s mod­esty, an of­fender can be jailed for up to a year and fined.</p>
