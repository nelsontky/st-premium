    <p>In the au­dit of an overseas mis­sion, the Au­di­tor-Gen­eral’s Of­fice (AGO) said the Min­istry of For­eign Af­fairs (MFA) had in­ad­e­quate mea­sures to en­force terms stip­u­lated in the ser­vice agree­ments signed with its au­tho­rised visa agents.</p>
    <p>The agree­ments stip­u­lated a fixed visa ap­pli­ca­tion fee and re­quired agents to use only des­ig­nated credit cards when trans­mit­ting visa pro­cess­ing fees to MFA.</p>
    <p>But the AGO found that visa ap­pli­ca­tion fees stated on the web­sites of three agents were higher than the fixed fee stip­u­lated in the ser­vice agree­ments.</p>
    <p>It also found that con­trols in the min­istry’s in­for­ma­tion and com­mu­ni­ca­tion tech­nol­ogy sys­tem were in­ef­fec­tive in de­tect­ing use of non-des­ig­nated credit cards by agents to trans­fer visa pro­cess­ing fees.</p>
    <p>PUB</p>
    <p>In its au­dit, the AGO found that PUB did not en­sure one of its pri­vate sec­tor part­ners had im­ple­mented ad­e­quate con­trols on users’ ac­cess to the agency’s IT sys­tem. This caused lapses like ex­ces­sive rights be­ing granted to the part­ner’s ven­dor and the shar­ing of an ad­min­is­tra­tor ac­count among the staff of the part­ner.</p>
    <p>PUB also had weak pay­ment con­trols for a project a pri­vate sec­tor part­ner was in­volved in, which al­lowed the part­ner to mod­ify real-time val­ues of pa­ram­e­ters in its IT sys­tem and af­fect the amounts to be paid by PUB.</p>
    <p>It also re­lied on in­for­ma­tion pro­vided by the part­ner on ar­eas like wa­ter out­put vol­ume to make pay­ments with­out car­ry­ing out ad­e­quate in­de­pen­dent ver­i­fi­ca­tion, the AGO added.</p>
    <p>WORK­FORCE SIN­GA­PORE</p>
    <p>The AGO flagged sev­eral is­sues with grant eval­u­a­tion and ap­proval in its busi­ness grant pro­grammes, along with grant dis­burse­ment and ces­sa­tion.</p>
    <p>This in­cluded in­stances of dou­ble claims by com­pa­nies and cases of dou­ble fund­ing across dif­fer­ent grants.</p>
    <p>It also un­cov­ered three cases where com­pa­nies or in­di­vid­u­als might have cir­cum­vented grant re­quire­ments and con­trols.</p>
    <p>The WSG has since made po­lice re­ports on these cases.</p>
