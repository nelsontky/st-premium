    <p>The year-long de­lay of the Tokyo Olympics has played havoc with the sport­ing cal­en­dar, but it has also pro­vided a sil­ver lin­ing for na­tional fencer Amita Berthier.</p>
    <p>In a bid to qual­ify for this year’s Games, the 19-year-old had put off her sec­ond aca­demic year at the Univer­sity of Notre Dame to train full-time at the Blue­grass Fencers’ Club in Lex­ing­ton, Ken­tucky, with coach Amgad Khazbak.</p>
    <p>She had tar­geted the now-post­poned Asian Olympic qual­i­fier, hop­ing to be­come the first Sin­ga­porean fencer to qual­ify for the Games. The new sched­ule has yet to be de­ter­mined af­ter the tour­na­ment was set to take place in April in Seoul.</p>
    <p>The last time the Repub­lic was rep­re­sented in fenc­ing was at the 1992 Barcelona Games by James Wong and Ron­ald Tan, who did not have to qual­ify then.</p>
    <p>Khazbak, who coached the US women’s foil team at the 2012 and 2016 Games, be­lieves the ex­tra time will be ben­e­fi­cial for Berthier.</p>
    <p>He said: “Amita has a great chance to qual­ify for the Olympics. The de­lay of the Olympics makes her more ready to qual­ify and fence bet­ter in the Olympics when she qual­i­fies. She has pro­gressed much with the ex­pe­ri­ence gained from par­tic­i­pat­ing at the se­nior level in the last year.”</p>
    <p>De­spite the dis­rup­tion, Berthier re­mains un­de­terred in her quest to fea­ture in Ja­pan.</p>
    <p>“Even though peo­ple are un­cer­tain as to whether the Olympics will even take place or not, to me, that doesn’t mat­ter be­cause I’m still go­ing to keep work­ing on my goal,” said Berthier, who flew back to Sin­ga­pore in March be­cause her club in Ken­tucky was shut ow­ing to the Covid-19 pan­demic. “I’m act­ing as if it’s go­ing to hap­pen and the qual­i­fi­ca­tions are go­ing to hap­pen.”</p>
    <p>She is re­turn­ing to In­di­ana to­mor­row to re­sume her stud­ies and is con­fi­dent she can jug­gle her aca­demic work­load with train­ing.</p>
    <p>Sev­eral of her univer­sity team­mates are also Olympic hope­fuls and their com­pany is some­thing she be­lieves will aid her.</p>
    <p>The world No. 59 women’s foil fencer, who has three gold medals from the 2017 and 2019 SEA Games, said: “I have aca­demics to worry about this year but I’m not too con­cerned be­cause I’m go­ing back to a univer­sity that re­ally sup­ports peo­ple aca­dem­i­cally and with sports.</p>
    <p>“It’s help­ful hav­ing a team that</p>
    <p>DIG­GING IN HER HEELS</p>
    <p>Even though peo­ple are un­cer­tain as to whether the Olympics will even take place or not, to me, that doesn’t mat­ter be­cause I’m still go­ing to keep work­ing on my goal. I’m act­ing as if it’s go­ing to hap­pen.” ’’</p>
    <p>AMITA BERTHIER, na­tional fencer, plans to keep chas­ing her Olympic dream.</p>
    <p>BET­TER NEXT YEAR</p>
    <p>Amita has a great chance to qual­ify for the Olympics. The de­lay of the Olympics makes her more ready to qual­ify and fence bet­ter in the Olympics when she qual­i­fies. ’’</p>
    <p>AMGAD KHAZBAK, Berthier’s coach, is feel­ing bullish about her chances of qual­i­fy­ing for next year’s Tokyo Games.</p>
    <p>has the same goal in mind. Your work ethic com­pletely changes when you see your team­mates be­ing as mo­ti­vated as you are.”</p>
    <p>For the first few weeks, school train­ing will be fo­cused on phys­i­cal con­di­tion­ing and in­di­vid­ual lessons with coaches as the univer­sity is only al­low­ing fenc­ing early next month.</p>
    <p>Berthier was fi­nally able to prop­erly train and spar at the Sin­ga­pore Sport In­sti­tute’s biome­chan­ics lab where fenc­ing strips were set up af­ter June 19, the first day of Sin­ga­pore’s Phase Two re­open­ing.</p>
    <p>Be­fore that, she had on­line ses­sions with her coach to work on tech­ni­cal as­pects of her game. She also fo­cused on main­tain­ing her fit­ness by run­ning or do­ing body­weight ex­er­cises.</p>
    <p>On be­ing able to fence again, she said: “I ap­pre­ci­ated it be­cause I know that a lot of my in­ter­na­tional friends are still stuck in quar­an­tine and are un­able to do so.”</p>
    <p>Al­though things have not gone as planned for Berthier, she has no re­grets about her de­ci­sion to take a year off from school. Apart from pol­ish­ing the tech­ni­cal as­pects of her game dur­ing that time, she also worked on her men­tal tough­ness – an area she felt needed to be im­proved on af­ter she nar­rowly lost sev­eral bouts last year.</p>
    <p>She said: “Be­cause it was the Olympic qual­i­fi­ca­tion year, I just re­ally wanted to qual­ify so in the be­gin­ning I told my­self that I was go­ing to do what­ever it takes to qual­ify so that added a bit of pres­sure.</p>
    <p>“I’ve grown in that way be­cause now I’m go­ing to take it one com­pe­ti­tion at a time and not worry too much about the end re­sult, but fo­cus in the mo­ment.”</p>
