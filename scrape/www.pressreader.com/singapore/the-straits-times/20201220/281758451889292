    <p>MANILA • At least two peo­ple were killed and hun­dreds forced to flee their i nun­dated homes i n the Philip­pines as tor­ren­tial rain trig­gered flood­ing and land­slides in the storm-bat­tered ar­chi­pel­ago, of­fi­cials said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Huge waves smashed i nto a coastal vil­lage on Lapu-Lapu is­land in the cen­tral prov­ince of Cebu on Fri­day night, wip­ing out dozens of houses and leav­ing around 290 peo­ple home­less, Mayor Ju­nard Chan said on Face­book.</p>
    <p>Pho­tos posted on­line by the mayor showed piles of wood and bam­boo near the few houses still stand­ing af­ter the re­gion was drenched by heavy rain.</p>
    <p>Res­cuers re­trieved the bod­ies of two el­derly women who were killed when a land­slide hit an area of Ma­hap­lag town be­fore dawn in the nearby prov­ince of Leyte, po­lice of­fi­cer Rac­quel Her­nan­dez said.</p>
    <p>A boy was also pulled from the rub­ble of his home and treated for his in­juries, Ms Her­nan­dez told Agence France-Presse.</p>
    <p>About 1,500 peo­ple were forced to leave their homes on the ma­jor south­ern is­land of Mindanao as flood wa­ters en­gulfed 13 vil­lages, the Na­tional Dis­as­ter Risk Re­duc­tion and Man­age­ment Coun­cil said.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, in Fiji, the death toll from Cy­clone Yasa rose to four yes­ter­day, with the dev­as­ta­tion wreaked by the storm com­pared to a war zone.</p>
    <p>Re­con­nais­sance flights showed en­tire vil­lages wiped out, and the au­thor­i­ties put the cost of dam­age at hun­dreds of millions of dol­lars.</p>
    <p>Aid work­ers fear the death toll will rise when con­tact is re-es­tab­lished with out­ly­ing ar­eas.</p>
    <p>A state of nat­u­ral dis­as­ter has been de­clared for 30 days as emer­gency ser­vices scram­ble to pro­vide food and cloth­ing to the worst-af­fected ar­eas.</p>
    <p>The su­per­storm slammed into Fiji’s sec­ond-largest is­land, Vanua Levu, late on Thurs­day, leav­ing a trail of de­struc­tion and af­fect­ing 93,000 peo­ple, said the Na­tional Dis­as­ter Man­age­ment Of­fice.</p>
    <p>Of the 24,000 peo­ple who evac­u­ated their homes at the height of the storm, 16,113 are still un­able to re­turn.</p>
    <p>A Royal New Zealand Air Force re­con­nais­sance flight flew over the area yes­ter­day to as­sess the scale of the dam­age, with re­ports of houses, crops and en­tire liveli­hoods wiped out. The storm also dam­aged schools and caused wide­spread flood­ing and land­slides.</p>
    <p>“We’ve been re­ceiv­ing pic­tures of Kia is­land. We have seen to­tal dev­as­ta­tion. It looks like a war zone,” Save the Chil­dren Fiji chief ex­ec­u­tive Shairana Ali told AFP.</p>
    <p>“Houses have been smashed to pieces and noth­ing re­mains. Peo­ple are re­ally des­per­ate for shel­ter and des­per­ate for food. There’s ob­vi­ously huge psy­cho­log­i­cal dam­age.”</p>
