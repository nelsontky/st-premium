    <p>The pre­cau­tion­ary mea­sures put in place to pro­tect vot­ers dur­ing the Covid-19 out­break re­duced vot­ing ef­fi­ciency and led to long queues at some polling sta­tions, the Elec­tions Depart­ment (ELD) said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>For in­stance, al­lo­cated time bands given to vot­ers in the July 10 elec­tion failed to spread out voter turnout through­out the day.</p>
    <p>Even though time bands in the morn­ing were for se­nior vot­ers, one-third who showed up then were not se­niors, the ELD said.</p>
    <p>The higher con­cen­tra­tion of these se­niors in the morn­ing also slowed voter flow-through rate, as more of them needed sup­port and as­sis­tance from elec­tion of­fi­cers.</p>
    <p>Other sta­tions with sig­nif­i­cantly higher pro­por­tions of younger vot­ers saw long queues in the af­ter­noon ow­ing to the large num­ber of vot­ers and the shorter seven-hour vot­ing win­dow which ex­cluded the morn­ing slots re­served for se­niors and the spe­cial vot­ing hour from 7pm to 8pm re­served for those serv­ing stay-home no­tices.</p>
    <p>The ELD ac­knowl­edged that in ret­ro­spect, it should not have con­cen­trated all se­nior vot­ers in the morn­ing.</p>
    <p>Another fac­tor that caused the long queues was the safe man­age­ment mea­sures such as tem­per­a­ture tak­ing, re­quir­ing vot­ers to put on dis­pos­able gloves and hand sani­tis­ing.</p>
    <p>The re­quire­ment that vot­ers stand 1m apart also con­trib­uted to the long queues, the ELD said.</p>
    <p>“ELD did away with the re­quire­ment to don dis­pos­able gloves in the early part of the morn­ing of Polling Day, as vot­ers would have al­ready sani­tised their hands. With this, the queue sit­u­a­tion at most polling sta­tions im­proved sig­nif­i­cantly by 11am,” the ELD said.</p>
    <p>“Nev­er­the­less, the other nec­es­sary pre­cau­tion­ary mea­sures... meant that vot­ers, in gen­eral, spent a longer time to queue and vote, as com­pared with past elec­tions.”</p>
    <p>Re­sources at large polling sta­tions could also have been bet­ter dis­trib­uted, the ELD said.</p>
    <p>There were 1,097 polling sta­tions in GE2020, up from 832 in GE2015, and there were an av­er­age of 2,400 vot­ers for each sta­tion. About 36,000 elec­tion of­fi­cers were de­ployed across the sta­tions, a 20 per cent in­crease from 2015.</p>
    <p>The ELD said that 25 polling sta­tions, or about 2.3 per cent of all sta­tions, served more than 4,400 vot­ers, and 22 of the 25 ex­pe­ri­enced long queues.</p>
    <p>The pre­vi­ous gen­eral elec­tion also saw a num­ber of polling sta­tions serv­ing larger num­bers of vot­ers, the ELD noted, adding that size alone is not a fac­tor for the long queues.</p>
    <p>“Size com­bined with the pre­cau­tion­ary mea­sures must have ag­gra­vated the sit­u­a­tion,” the ELD said.</p>
    <p>“Some premises also had two polling sta­tions, and the two queues merged into one some dis­tance away from the polling area, fur­ther length­en­ing the queues.”</p>
    <p>The depart­ment said the 25 large polling sta­tions should have been given more elec­tion of­fi­cers or ereg­is­tra­tion de­vices.</p>
    <p>The e-reg­is­tra­tion de­vices also posed is­sues. The ELD said the orig­i­nal plan, be­fore Covid-19 struck, was for elec­tion of­fi­cers to scan vot­ers’ NRICs.</p>
    <p>“How­ever, with the Covid-19 sit­u­a­tion, vot­ers were asked to self­s­can their NRICs. ELD had in­tended to do road­shows to fa­mil­iarise vot­ers with the e-reg­is­tra­tion de­vice, but these had to be called off ow­ing to the Covid-19 sit­u­a­tion.</p>
    <p>“As a re­sult, vot­ers were un­fa­mil­iar with the e-reg­is­tra­tion de­vices, and this process took longer than planned.”</p>
