    <p>Seven Quick Build Dor­mi­to­ries (QBD) with im­proved liv­ing standards for mi­grant work­ers have been com­pleted, with eight more ex­pected to be ready by the sec­ond half of next year, Min­is­ter for Na­tional Devel­op­ment Des­mond</p>
    <p>Lee told re­porters yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>By then, there will be a to­tal of 25,000 bed spa­ces at QBDs, up from the 8,000 cur­rently avail­able. Th­ese dorms are part of ef­forts to re­duce the den­sity of work­ers in ex­ist­ing ac­com­mo­da­tion, he said.</p>
    <p>Ex­act plans for the up­com­ing QBDs will de­pend on sev­eral fac­tors, such as the pipe­line of both pub­lic and pri­vate con­struc­tion projects. Keep­ing an eye on the needs of sec­tors such as marine and process would also give a bet­ter es­ti­mate of the num­ber of spa­ces needed, added Mr Lee.</p>
    <p>“So it’s a dy­namic process, and very much a case of us not just mod­el­ling the needs of our firms and our sec­tors, but also en­sur­ing that we have a good suite of op­tions avail­able for our com­pa­nies and guest work­ers,” he said.</p>
    <p>Mr Lee was speak­ing with re­porters dur­ing a visit to one of the first ready-to-move-in QBDs, lo­cated in the in­dus­trial es­tate along Kranji Way.</p>
    <p>Sec­ond Min­is­ter for Man­power Tan See Leng, who ac­com­pa­nied Mr Lee on the visit, said the au­thor­i­ties will press on with the con­struc­tion of longer-term ac­com­mo­da­tion even though the num­ber of Covid-19 cases in dorms has re­mained low in re­cent weeks.</p>
    <p>Westlite Kranji Way is a 1,300-bed dorm de­vel­oped by JTC and now man­aged by Westlite Ac­com­mo­da­tion, a sub­sidiary of dorm op­er­a­tor Cen­tu­rion Cor­po­ra­tion. Oper­a­tions there started on Sept 21, with the first res­i­dents mov­ing in on Sept 30.</p>
    <p>The QBDs are semi-per­ma­nent struc­tures meant to last two or three years. They em­body new liv­ing standards such as hav­ing no more than 10 beds per room, and at least 6 sq m of liv­ing space per res­i­dent, not in­clud­ing shared fa­cil­i­ties.</p>
    <p>Dr Tan said the strat­egy by the au­thor­i­ties to spread out work­ers in dorms has been ef­fec­tive, with the av­er­age oc­cu­pancy in pur­pose-built dorms drop­ping to less than 70 per cent.</p>
    <p>Fac­to­ries have been al­lowed to be con­verted to dorms, while tem­po­rary liv­ing quar­ters have been set up at work­sites as part of this “de-den­si­fi­ca­tion” process, he said.</p>
    <p>Taken to­gether with other mea­sures, such as ros­tered rou­tine test­ing of work­ers, th­ese have led to the rel­a­tively more stable Covid-19 sit­u­a­tion in Sin­ga­pore to­day, he said.</p>
    <p>He noted that no for­eign worker in a dorm tested pos­i­tive from Tues­day to Thurs­day, but urged cau­tion, say­ing that “the bat­tle is far from over”.</p>
    <p>He also said the mea­sures im­ple­mented are “sci­en­tif­i­cally based”, with stud­ies done to show how droplets can po­ten­tially spread dis­ease, demon­strat­ing the ben­e­fits of hav­ing safe dis­tanc­ing of 1m.</p>
    <p>Fa­cil­i­ties at Westlite Kranji Way in­clude a min­i­mart, a can­teen and a bar­ber shop. The dorm is cur­rently about 26 per cent oc­cu­pied.</p>
    <p>There are five beds to a room, pro­vid­ing a liv­ing space of about 6 sq m per res­i­dent, not in­clud­ing shared fa­cil­i­ties. The room also has per­sonal lock­ers, power points, and an en-suite toi­let, sink and shower.</p>
    <p>Safe liv­ing mea­sures i nclude seg­re­gat­ing the dorm into six clus­ters, which do not i nter­mix. There are also sep­a­rate pickup and drop-off points, as well as walk­ways for res­i­dents of dif­fer­ent clus­ters.</p>
    <p>Westlite Kranji Way res­i­dent Yang Shengli, 50, said he prefers the new ar­range­ment more than his pre­vi­ous ac­com­mo­da­tion at Wood­lands, which had 12 peo­ple to a room.</p>
    <p>“It’s cleaner here, more com­fort­able, and the staff’s at­ti­tude is very good. Hav­ing one toi­let per room is also more hy­gienic,” said the con­struc­tion worker.</p>
