    <p>As the world grap­ples with the coro­n­avirus, the ugly face of vac­cine na­tion­al­ism emerges. Global af­fairs correspond­ent Jonathan Eyal (be­low) looks at the pol­i­tics of a pan­demic as the race for a vac­cine heats up.</p>
    <p>LON­DON • “In the com­ing months, we all hope to have good news about a vac­cine for Covid-19,” Dr Te­dros Ad­hanom Ghe­breye­sus, di­rec­tor-gen­eral of the World Health Or­gan­i­sa­tion, re­marked re­cently.</p>
    <p>But when an ef­fec­tive vac­cine does be­come avail­able, he re­minded gov­ern­ments, the pri­or­ity must be to ad­min­is­ter it first to front-line health work­ers and those most vul­ner­a­ble around the world, rather than wit­ness a fight be­tween na­tions as to which one suc­ceeds in grab­bing vac­cine sup­plies first.</p>
    <p>“Us­ing vac­cines as a global public good is in the na­tional in­ter­est of each and ev­ery coun­try,” added Dr Te­dros. “Vac­cine na­tion­al­ism will pro­long the pan­demic, not shorten it.”</p>
    <p>Many gov­ern­ments are tak­ing con­crete steps to en­sure that a fu­ture vac­cine will be made avail­able world­wide.</p>
    <p>The Covid-19 Vac­cine Global Ac­cess (Co­vax) Fa­cil­ity is one such mech­a­nism de­voted to en­sur­ing rapid, fair and eq­ui­table ac­cess to a vac­cine. Sin­ga­pore and Switzer­land co-chair the Friends of the Co­vax Fa­cil­ity, an as­so­ci­a­tion de­voted to en­sur­ing that words are fol­lowed by deeds.</p>
    <p>Yet be­hind the scenes, some gov­ern­ments are en­gag­ing in pre­cisely the sort of vac­cine na­tion­al­ism ev­ery­one claims to de­plore. The fight is not just about ac­cess to the right quan­ti­ties of jabs, but also about who would be able to claim the po­lit­i­cal credit for de­vel­op­ing the vac­cine in the first place.</p>
    <p>It all sounds very silly. For, at a time when hun­dreds of thou­sands of peo­ple are dy­ing from Covid-19 and economies world­wide are tank­ing, who cares whether one gov­ern­ment or an­other be­comes the first to put for­ward a suc­cess­ful vac­cine?</p>
    <p>But the re­al­ity is that for some coun­tries, this is a race about pro­tect­ing their own rep­u­ta­tions, and that could mat­ter more than the sim­ple task of sav­ing lives.</p>
    <p>Mr Ken McCallum, the boss of Bri­tain’s do­mes­tic in­tel­li­gence service MI5, has now openly ac­cused Rus­sia of try­ing to hack into Bri­tish vac­cine re­search, which is cur­rently among the most ad­vanced.</p>
    <p>And ev­i­dence is now emerg­ing of a much wider Rus­sian ef­fort to dis­credit the vi­a­bil­ity of West­ern-en­gi­neered vac­cines by spread­ing false in­for­ma­tion about their safety.</p>
    <p>The Rus­sian gov­ern­ment is fer­vently deny­ing these charges. What is not in doubt, how­ever, is that a vi­cious bat­tle de­signed to dis­credit vac­cine pro­grammes is un­fold­ing.</p>
    <p>POL­I­TICS AMID A PAN­DEMIC</p>
    <p>Most peo­ple tend to view the cur­rent coro­n­avirus pan­demic as es­sen­tially a health cri­sis. But, as most politi­cians around the world know only too well, what his­tory will re­call most is which gov­ern­ment did bet­ter than oth­ers, and which po­lit­i­cal sys­tem proved it­self more re­silient.</p>
    <p>In fact, it could be ar­gued that po­lit­i­cal pos­tur­ing came be­fore the med­i­cal ef­forts in han­dling this cri­sis. There is lit­tle doubt that, had the Chi­nese gov­ern­ment failed to con­tain the pan­demic – or at least con­tain the nar­ra­tive about the pan­demic and the num­ber of ca­su­al­ties – the Chi­nese Com­mu­nist Party would have faced one of the gravest chal­lenges to its rule. So, Bei­jing han­dled it in the way it al­ways han­dles such things: a firm hand and a com­plete news black­out.</p>
    <p>Nor is there much doubt that the sub­se­quent demon­stra­tive – and of­ten counter-pro­duc­tive – ef­forts to present China as the chief donor of med­i­cal equip­ment to other na­tions were in­tended to project the vin­di­ca­tion of the Chi­nese po­lit­i­cal sys­tem as su­pe­rior to cap­i­tal­ist ones.</p>
    <p>Con­versely, United States Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump’s ini­tial de­ter­mi­na­tion to re­fer to the pan­demic as the “Wuhan virus” was a clear at­tempt to pin re­spon­si­bil­ity on the Chi­nese po­lit­i­cal sys­tem.</p>
    <p>But the best in­di­ca­tion of how po­lit­i­cal the man­age­ment of the cri­sis re­mains comes from the mor­tal­ity ta­bles that are cur­rently be­ing com­piled, in­di­cat­ing how many peo­ple have died per</p>
    <p>100,000 in­hab­i­tants in coun­tries around the world.</p>
    <p>Never mind that the statis­tics sel­dom com­pare like with like, that coun­tries col­lect statis­tics in dif­fer­ent ways, that the def­i­ni­tion of what con­sti­tutes death from the coro­n­avirus varies from na­tion to na­tion, or that such com­par­isons ig­nore variables such as na­tional pop­u­la­tion den­si­ties or age pro­files.</p>
    <p>The Covid-19 global mor­tal­ity charts now re­sem­ble a sort of ghoul­ish ver­sion of the old Olympic medal league ta­bles, with some coun­tries be­ing hailed as cham­pi­ons, while oth­ers are be­ing dis­missed as fail­ures.</p>
    <p>This has di­rect po­lit­i­cal con­se­quences. Just ask New Zealand Prime Min­is­ter Jacinda Ardern, who was re-elected last week­end with the high­est ma­jor­ity her Labour Party has en­joyed in al­most half a cen­tury, mainly be­cause of the way she is per­ceived to have man­aged the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>The per­ceived rights and wrongs of man­ag­ing the pan­demic are also al­most cer­tain to de­cide who will run the US un­til the mid­dle of the decade.</p>
    <p>The pan­demic con­tin­ues to test the per­for­mance of gov­ern­ments; many coun­tries are cur­rently ex­pe­ri­enc­ing a sec­ond wave of coro­n­avirus in­fec­tions.</p>
    <p>Yet as all lead­ers know, an even big­ger po­lit­i­cal bat­tle will open when a re­li­able vac­cine emerges.</p>
    <p>It may be nice to claim – as many gov­ern­ments cur­rently do – that they will en­sure equal ac­cess to the vac­cine for all na­tions. But try to think of the predica­ment of any leader forced to tell his or her peo­ple that they should wait – and po­ten­tially ex­pe­ri­ence fur­ther deaths – for a longer pe­riod of time than nec­es­sary be­cause a share of the first batch of vac­cines must be sent to, say, vul­ner­a­ble peo­ple in So­ma­lia.</p>
    <p>NEXT BAT­TLE: FASTEST VACCINATOR</p>
    <p>In the­ory, this makes per­fect sense. But, in prac­tice, to para­phrase an old Euro­pean politi­cian’s say­ing: “How do you get re-elected af­ter ar­gu­ing this?”</p>
    <p>So, if the cur­rent bat­tle is about prov­ing the ef­fi­ciency of a gov­ern­ment or a po­lit­i­cal sys­tem based on how many deaths from Covid-19 have been recorded, the next bat­tle will be about who vac­ci­nates his or her peo­ple as fast as pos­si­ble.</p>
    <p>For a coun­try like Rus­sia, there is the added prob­lem of na­tional rep­u­ta­tion, which mat­ters prob­a­bly as much. Since he came to power two decades ago, Rus­sian Pres­i­dent Vladimir Putin has tried to per­suade his na­tion that the coun­try can re­sume its place as one of the world’s top pow­ers.</p>
    <p>The re­al­ity has been more hum­drum: Al­though it has a highly ed­u­cated pop­u­la­tion and a dis­tin­guished his­tory of in­no­va­tion, it has failed to close the gap with the West in most tech­nol­ogy fields. But, just be­cause the ef­fort to catch up with the West re­mains in­her­ently plau­si­ble, Mr Putin keeps on try­ing.</p>
    <p>That is the rea­son why he rushed to an­nounce as far back as Au­gust that Rus­sia had beaten all other na­tions in pro­duc­ing a coro­n­avirus vac­cine.</p>
    <p>That ig­nored some tiny in­con­ve­nient de­tails – such as the fact that when the Rus­sian Pres­i­dent made his an­nounce­ment, the vac­cine had ap­par­ently been tested on only 76 peo­ple in a study that has al­ready been crit­i­cised for a num­ber of med­i­cal ir­reg­u­lar­i­ties.</p>
    <p>It equally ig­nores the re­al­ity that, since Mr Putin’s an­nounce­ment, no mass vac­ci­na­tion has be­gun, and not many other coun­tries are rush­ing to get the Rus­sian vac­cine ei­ther.</p>
    <p>For the ob­ject was purely po­lit­i­cal: to tell the world that Rus­sia has beaten the West to the fin­ish­ing line. And the vac­cine was named Sput­nik, in a de­lib­er­ate at­tempt to link it to the first ar­ti­fi­cial satel­lite to or­bit Earth, which back in 1957 made the Soviet Union the world’s first space power.</p>
    <p>The mes­sage was clear: If Rus­sian sci­en­tists stole a march on the world dur­ing the past cen­tury, they could steal an­other march now.</p>
    <p>But the pub­lic­ity cam­paign ap­pears to have ex­hausted it­self, so some­one in Moscow is now mov­ing on to more ac­tive mea­sures.</p>
    <p>‘MON­KEY VAC­CINE’ DIS­IN­FOR­MA­TION</p>
    <p>Over the past few weeks, a Rus­sian dis­in­for­ma­tion cam­paign de­signed to un­der­mine and spread fear about the Covid-19 vac­cine cur­rently be­ing de­vel­oped by Bri­tain’s Ox­ford Univer­sity is un­fold­ing.</p>
    <p>Mir­ror­ing tech­niques used to in­flu­ence the 2016 US pres­i­den­tial elec­tion, it con­sists of the pro­duc­tion of video clips, memes and var­i­ous so­cial plat­form “con­tri­bu­tions”, all in­tended to claim that the Bri­tish vac­cine is not safe, be­cause it could turn those vac­ci­nated into mon­keys, since the vac­cine uses a chim­panzee virus as a vec­tor.</p>
    <p>The story is, of course, so crass as to be laugh­able. But then, so was the story that Rus­sian-af­fil­i­ated Web plat­forms spread about</p>
    <p>Mrs Hil­lary Clin­ton in the 2016 US elec­tion, al­leg­ing that she and her sup­port­ers were in­volved in a child sex ring run from a pizza par­lour in Wash­ing­ton.</p>
    <p>For such sto­ries are man­u­fac­tured not to be be­lieved, but just to sow doubts in the minds of peo­ple. Very few of those who may be tempted to ac­cept a fu­ture Bri­tish-made Covid-19 vac­cine are likely to be­lieve that they will turn into mon­keys, but if they ques­tion the safety of the vac­cine, that will be suf­fi­cient.</p>
    <p>There is yet no con­clu­sive ev­i­dence that this vac­cine dis­in­for­ma­tion cam­paign is ex­plic­itly au­tho­rised by the Rus­sian gov­ern­ment. But it em­anates from Rus­sia, some of its wildest al­le­ga­tions have been fea­tured on Rus­sian state TV, and the ex­er­cise con­forms to a Rus­sian pat­tern.</p>
    <p>For, as has been con­clu­sively proven, Soviet in­tel­li­gence of­fi­cers were re­spon­si­ble for a dis­in­for­ma­tion cam­paign dur­ing the 1980s, al­leg­ing that the virus that causes Aids was pro­duced in a US mil­i­tary lab. The files of “Op­er­a­tion In­fek­tion”, as the cam­paign was then called, are now avail­able, and their de­tails mir­ror some of the cur­rent tac­tics.</p>
    <p>Ul­ti­mately, the Rus­sian ob­jec­tive may be noth­ing more than to muddy the waters so that when a vac­cine emerges, the claims and counter-claims would be so con­fus­ing that no­body would be able to work out who was the first to pro­duce it, and Mr Putin would still be able to claim that Rus­sia’s in­ge­nu­ity tri­umphed.</p>
    <p>Still, this is a very dan­ger­ous game, for the pro­mo­tion of such zany dis­in­for­ma­tion cam­paigns can dam­age not only West­ern vac­cine ef­forts, but also the wider global ef­fort to pro­tect against the virus by en­cour­ag­ing con­spir­acy the­o­rists and the anti-vac­ci­na­tion move­ment.</p>
    <p>The episode is also a warn­ing of the global po­lit­i­cal bat­tles that still lie ahead.</p>
    <p>The Rus­sians ought to re­mem­ber that, al­though their Sput­nik pro­gramme was the first and al­lowed them to claim a tech­no­log­i­cal ad­van­tage, it also un­leashed a race to the moon, which the US de­ci­sively won less than a decade later.</p>
