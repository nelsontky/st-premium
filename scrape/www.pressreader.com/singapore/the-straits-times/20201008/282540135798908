    <p>In Net­flix’s lat­est In­dian orig­i­nal movie re­lease, Se­ri­ous Men, the cen­tral char­ac­ter Ayyan Mani is keenly aware of his place in the world as a lower-caste man work­ing as a per­sonal as­sis­tant to a renowned scientist in a pres­ti­gious sci­ence in­sti­tute.</p>
    <p>But Mani, played by Nawazud­din Sid­diqui, is de­ter­mined to break out of the poverty cy­cle with the tools he has, such as a com­mand of English, and what­ever means nec­es­sary.</p>
    <p>At one point, hav­ing sneaked into a high-class ho­tel pool­side with his wife – thanks to his English – he makes a sharp ob­ser­va­tion that it takes four gen­er­a­tions to be able to sit by a pool and do noth­ing.</p>
    <p>As he ex­plains to his wife Oja (Indira Ti­wari), he is sec­ond gen­er­a­tion or 2G – armed with an education, but un­able to en­joy him­self.</p>
    <p>Their son Adi will progress one step ahead, but it is his chil­dren, rep­re­sent­ing the 4G, who “won’t have to work at all... They can just sit by a pool and do noth­ing all day”.</p>
    <p>“You can re­late to the char­ac­ter eas­ily be­cause in day-to-day life, there are so many Ayyan Ma­nis,” Nawazud­din, 46, tells The Straits Times via Zoom in an in­ter­view along­side the film’s di­rec­tor Sud­hir Mishra and Se­ri­ous Men au­thor Manu Joseph.</p>
    <p>“Ev­ery­body wants his kid to progress one or two gen­er­a­tions ahead, just that Ayyan Mani did it in a wrong man­ner... But he’s just a hu­man be­ing, so he’s fal­li­ble and will al­ways make mis­takes. He’s flawed in that sense.”</p>
    <p>Flawed char­ac­ters seem a main­stay of Nawazud­din’s rich and var­ied ca­reer in the In­dian film in­dus­try. He has played ev­ery­thing from a no­to­ri­ous gang­ster in dark, gritty Web se­ries Sa­cred Games (2018 to 2019) to a small-town cop in this year’s twist­ing who­dun­nit, Raat Akeli Hai (The Night Is Lonely).</p>
    <p>Au­thor and jour­nal­ist Joseph, 46, who is be­hind the 2010 novel of the same name on which Se­ri­ous Men is based, feels Nawazud­din re­ally sank his teeth into the role as a scrappy, work­ing-class father try­ing to take charge of his destiny by run­ning a risky con to se­cure a bet­ter life for his son.</p>
    <p>Joseph’s own ex­pe­ri­ence of strad­dling the worlds of the haves and the have-nots in­formed his writ­ing of Se­ri­ous Men.</p>
    <p>On the one hand, he was writ­ing for mag­a­zines and con­tribut­ing to The New Yorker and The New York Times, but at the same time, he was liv­ing in a chawl – a ten­e­ment for work­ing-class folk.</p>
    <p>“The av­er­age In­dian is a very in­ter­est­ing per­son with his own swag and Nawazud­din cap­tures that,” says Joseph.</p>
    <p>“There’s a na­tive in­tel­li­gence when they speak that cap­tures a cer­tain phi­los­o­phy that is com­i­cal and bit­ter (at the same time) – there’s a lot of char­ac­ter and they’re not pre­tend­ing.”</p>
    <p>For es­tab­lished di­rec­tor Mishra, how­ever, he hopes au­di­ences will see that “the novel ex­ists on one level and film, on an­other”.</p>
    <p>“If you try to mimic the novel, the film can’t work on its own steam,” says Mishra, who is be­hind films such as Dhar­avi (1992) and Chameli (2003).</p>
    <p>How­ever, as much as they moved away from the novel in the screen­play, he says: “I found my­self con­stantly read­ing the book.</p>
    <p>“Af­ter the shoot, I would read some pas­sages to be in touch with this crazy, tan­gen­tial mind... Manu was also there through­out the shoot.”</p>
    <p>Says Joseph: “In this en­vi­ron­ment where writ­ers think they’re not get­ting their due in a medium like cin­ema, I was treated so well on the set.”</p>
    <p>He adds that he was even mis­taken for the pro­ducer once.</p>
    <p>He also helped the lead ac­tor with the Tamil di­a­logue that pep­pers the film.</p>
    <p>“I got the right pronunciat­ion from Manu. It was very easy be­cause he was there,” says Nawazud­din, who had to de­liver lines in Tamil op­po­site leg­endary South In­dian ac­tor Nas­sar, who played his un­scrupu­lous boss, Dr Arvind Acharya.</p>
    <p>While the pan­demic scup­pered plans for a pre­miere and a screen­ing for friends and fans, Mishra, who has more than 30 years’ ex­pe­ri­ence in the In­dian film in­dus­try, feels that the “tech­ni­cal qual­ity of Net­flix is quite amaz­ing”.</p>
    <p>This is his first time work­ing with the global stream­ing plat­form.</p>
    <p>He ap­pre­ci­ated the free­dom and in­de­pen­dence with which he could make the film, call­ing it “the place for writ­ers and artists, for peo­ple with things to say” – es­pe­cially for a film like Se­ri­ous Men that es­chews typ­i­cal Bol­ly­wood tropes.</p>
    <p>“I’d like peo­ple who watch reg­u­lar Bol­ly­wood films to give this film a chance be­cause it doesn’t take it­self se­ri­ously... The char­ac­ter of Ayyan Mani is fas­ci­nat­ing, as are the pe­riph­eral char­ac­ters – the scientist, the wife, the politi­cian and his daughter – it’s a very rich film.”</p>
