    <p>Ja­panese au­thor Sayaka Mu­rata burst onto the in­ter­na­tional lit­er­ary scene with the award-win­ning Con­ve­nience Store Woman, pub­lished in Ja­panese in 2016 and trans­lated into English in 2018.</p>
    <p>In the book, a so­cial mis­fit finds a sense of be­long­ing while work­ing at one of Ja­pan’s ubiq­ui­tous con­ve­nience stores.</p>
    <p>Mu­rata stays true to form in Earth­lings, which was pub­lished in Ja­panese in 2018 and is her sec­ond novel to be trans­lated into English by Ginny Tap­ley Take­mori.</p>
    <p>This com­ing-of-age story has a pro­tag­o­nist who is creep­ily weird yet also dis­com­fit­ingly fa­mil­iar.</p>
    <p>Nat­suki, 11, talks to her hedge­hog plush toy Piyyut and is con­vinced that she is an alien from the planet Popin­pobopia, if only as a form of es­capism from her dys­func­tional fam­ily.</p>
    <p>She is in love with her cousin Yuu, who is the son of a sin­gle mother and also be­lieves he is from Popin­pobopia.</p>
    <p>The two chil­dren, who meet only once a year when the ex­tended fam­ily gath­ers in a fam­ily home in moun­tain­ous Nagano, see them­selves “liv­ing as par­a­sites on our fam­i­lies”.</p>
    <p>They pri­vately ex­change mar­riage vows, en­ter­ing a pact to “sur­vive no mat­ter what”, though they are even­tu­ally split up.</p>
    <p>Earth­lings is not the eas­i­est novel to stom­ach.</p>
    <p>Par­ents, drawn to the cutesy cover, may be in­clined to pick up the book for their chil­dren, but should be fore­warned that it con­tains adult themes such as in­cest – al­beit con­sen­sual – can­ni­bal­ism, sex­ual awak­en­ing and child abuse.</p>
    <p>Nat­suki says: “The per­son who had given birth to me said I was a dead loss, so I de­cided it re­ally must be true. I was prob­a­bly caus­ing a nui­sance to the neigh­bours just by ex­ist­ing.”</p>
    <p>She comes to be­lieve that she has mag­i­cal pow­ers, in­clud­ing “out-of­body ex­pe­ri­ences”, in which her soul dis­so­ci­ates from her hu­man body – though this is more likely to be a cop­ing mech­a­nism for trauma</p>
    <p>– and has been en­trusted with a mis­sion to rid the world of a wicked witch.</p>
    <p>As an adult, she en­ters into a sex­less, ro­mance-less, con­trac­tual mar­riage with To­moya in or­der to sat­isfy the de­mand that they be­come cogs of the “Fac­tory” – a eu­phemism for so­ci­ety at large, epit­o­mised by her end­lessly pry­ing mother and sis­ter.</p>
    <p>They flee to Nagano, where Yuu now lives in their fam­ily home, and the trio de­cide to live in a moral vac­uum as they await sal­va­tion in their ver­sion of Eden.</p>
    <p>But their par­adise – like that in South Korea’s Academy Award­win­ning Par­a­site (2019), a movie about class dis­crim­i­na­tion and the des­per­ate lengths a down-and-out fam­ily will go to climb the so­cial lad­der – does not last for long.</p>
    <p>Like­wise, Mu­rata’s tale is a wholly orig­i­nal con­tem­pla­tion of the ills that threaten Ja­panese so­ci­ety today and their po­ten­tially de­bil­i­tat­ing ef­fect on men­tal health.</p>
    <p>She gives a voice – al­beit a twisted one – to the voice­less: the bul­lied school­child­ren, the mi­nors who fall prey to pae­dophiles and the adults who are pres­sured to con­form to so­ci­etal norms.</p>
    <p>If you like this, read: Breasts And Eggs by Mieko Kawakami, trans­lated by Sam Bett and David Boyd (Pi­cador, 2020, $29.95, avail­able at bit.ly/BEg­gs_MK), a timely and in­ti­mate, if rad­i­cal, de­pic­tion of what it means to be mod­ern women in Ja­pan and rebel against so­cial norms.</p>
