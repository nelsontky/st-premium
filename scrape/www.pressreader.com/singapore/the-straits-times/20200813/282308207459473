    <p>News that Rus­sia will roll out a Covid-19 vac­cine sent the shares of three Sin­ga­pore-listed glove man­u­fac­tur­ers plung­ing yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The sell-off wiped out the con­sid­er­able gains the shares had racked up over re­cent weeks.</p>
    <p>The trig­ger was Rus­sia’s an­nounce­ment on Tues­day night that it has ap­proved the world’s first vac­cine against the coro­n­avirus al­though clin­i­cal tri­als will con­tinue.</p>
    <p>Its an­nounce­ment ap­peared to weigh on sen­ti­ment for glove plays, as an ef­fec­tive vac­cine could curb the spread of Covid-19 and dampen de­mand for gloves.</p>
    <p>Main­board-listed River­stone Hold­ings sank 12.7 per cent to $3.99 within the first hour of the mar­ket open­ing be­fore re­cov­er­ing a lit­tle to close down 9.4 per cent at $4.14.</p>
    <p>About 12 mil­lion shares changed hands, mak­ing it the third most ac­tive stock by value on the bourse.</p>
    <p>Its share spiked to a record high of $4.69 last Fri­day, two days af­ter River­stone an­nounced that its hal­fyear earn­ings had more than dou­bled. The Malaysian com­pany spe­cialises in gloves for clean rooms and health­care.</p>
    <p>Malaysia-based Top Glove, the world’s largest glove man­u­fac­turer, plunged 12.8 per cent early on but re­cov­ered slightly to close at $8.19, down 9.3 per cent with 2.8 mil­lion shares traded.</p>
    <p>The main­board-listed stock had ral­lied to a peak last Thurs­day when it closed at $9.30, up about 38.9 per cent from a month ear­lier.</p>
    <p>Top Glove said on Mon­day that it ex­pects to pay about RM53 mil­lion (S$17.3 mil­lion) in re­me­di­a­tion fees to mi­grant work­ers it em­ployed be­fore it im­ple­mented a new stan­dard for eth­i­cal re­cruit­ment.</p>
    <p>Dis­pos­able glove man­u­fac­turer UG Health­care’s stel­lar fi­nan­cial re­sults re­leased on Tues­day were not enough to prop up its shares.</p>
    <p>The Catal­ist board counter rapidly re­treated 18.5 per cent early in the ses­sion be­fore clos­ing at $2.98, a fall of 11.6 per cent with 10.5 mil­lion shares traded. Sim­i­lar to its peers, UG Health­care had en­joyed a bullish run over the past sev­eral weeks, jump­ing to $3.37 on Tues­day be­fore an­nounc­ing full-year re­sults.</p>
    <p>Earn­ings for the sec­ond half ended June 30 hit $12.6 mil­lion, markedly higher than the $1.2 mil­lion recorded a year ear­lier.</p>
    <p>Rev­enue surged 80.9 per cent, boosted by the higher vol­ume and sell­ing prices of gloves.</p>
    <p>Full-year net profit was $13.4 mil­lion com­pared with $2.5 mil­lion in the pre­vi­ous year, while rev­enue grew 57.2 per cent to $144.2 mil­lion.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day’s share price falls of the glove firms were in stark con­trast to health­care</p>
    <p>Medtecs In­ter­na­tional.</p>
    <p>The Catal­ist-listed stock rock­eted 44.6 per cent to $1.41 with a re­mark­com­pany able 150.5 mil­lion shares traded af­ter post­ing a ro­bust set of fi­nan­cial re­sults on Tues­day night.</p>
