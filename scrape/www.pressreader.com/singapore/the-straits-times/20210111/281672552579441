    <p>Sin­ga­pore re­ported a nine-month high of 42 im­ported cases yes­ter­day, more than half of whom were work per­mit hold­ers who ar­rived from Bangladesh, In­dia, In­done­sia, Malaysia and the Philip­pines.</p>
    <p>Five of these 24 work per­mit hold­ers were for­eign do­mes­tic work­ers, and 40 of the im­ported cases were asymp­to­matic.</p>
    <p>The other 18 cases com­prised two Sin­ga­pore­ans, two per­ma­nent res­i­dents (PRs), six de­pen­dant’s pass hold­ers, four work pass hold­ers, one long-term visit pass holder, one short-term visit pass holder and two spe­cial pass hold­ers, bring­ing Sin­ga­pore’s to­tal to 58,907.</p>
    <p>All the cases had been placed on stay-home no­tice or iso­lated upon ar­rival in Sin­ga­pore, and were tested dur­ing this pe­riod, said the Min­istry of Health (MOH) in a press state­ment last night.</p>
    <p>The two Sin­ga­pore­ans were re­turn­ing from Malaysia while both PRs were re­turn­ing from In­dia.</p>
    <p>Both the long-term visit pass holder and the short-term visit pass holder also ar­rived from In­dia, while the six de­pen­dant’s pass hold­ers ar­rived from Aus­tria, In­dia, Nepal and the United Arab Emi­rates.</p>
    <p>The two spe­cial pass hold­ers were sea crew who ar­rived on sep­a­rate ves­sels from Myan­mar and In­done­sia. They had been tested on board and had not disem­barked be­fore be­ing tested.</p>
    <p>They were taken to hos­pi­tal when they tested pos­i­tive for Covid-19, said MOH.</p>
    <p>Forty-two is the high­est num­ber of im­ported cases since March 28, which saw the same num­ber of cases.</p>
    <p>The num­ber of new cases in the com­mu­nity has de­creased to eight last week from 10 the week be­fore.</p>
    <p>The num­ber of un­linked cases in the com­mu­nity has in­creased to five in the past week from four the week be­fore.</p>
    <p>With 25 cases dis­charged yes­ter­day, 58,621 pa­tients have fully re­cov­ered from the disease.</p>
    <p>A to­tal of 60 pa­tients re­main in hos­pi­tal, in­clud­ing one in the in­ten­sive care unit, while 182 are re­cu­per­at­ing in com­mu­nity fa­cil­i­ties.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore has had 29 deaths from Covid-19 com­pli­ca­tions, while 15 who tested pos­i­tive have died of other causes.</p>
