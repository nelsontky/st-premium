    <p>Prop­erty firm ERA Realty Net­work is in­tro­duc­ing dig­i­tal sig­na­tures for ten­ancy agree­ments, be­com­ing the first com­pany in the pri­vate sec­tor to pi­lot the re­cently launched Sign with SingPass ser­vice.</p>
    <p>The move will help its agents save time, as they will no longer need to meet prop­erty own­ers in per­son for sig­na­tures, and also min­imise phys­i­cal con­tact amid the Covid-19 pan­demic.</p>
    <p>It will also ben­e­fit prop­erty own­ers who are based over­seas.</p>
    <p>ERA an­nounced the ini­tia­tive at its Q4 Ca­reer Ad­vance­ment Day yes­ter­day to recog­nise its top per­form­ers.</p>
    <p>“ERA is in full sup­port of the Gov­ern­ment’s ini­tia­tive to build a trusted dig­i­tal ecosys­tem as we move to­wards an in­creas­ingly ef­fi­cient and con­ve­nient Smart Na­tion,” said ERA Sin­ga­pore chief ex­ec­u­tive Jack Chua.</p>
    <p>Sign with SingPass sup­ports dig­i­tal sig­na­tures on all ma­jor plat­forms such as DocuSign, iText, Netrust, Adobe, OneS­pan, De­doco, Tes­sar­act.io and Ko­fax.</p>
    <p>ERA is us­ing De­doco’s dig­i­tal doc­u­ment so­lu­tion.</p>
    <p>The Sign with SingPass ser­vice, de­vel­oped by the Gov­ern­ment Tech­nol­ogy Agency (GovTech), al­lows busi­nesses to se­curely ver­ify elec­tronic sig­na­tures, which can be adopted for more le­gal and busi­ness doc­u­ments that pre­vi­ously had to be signed phys­i­cally.</p>
    <p>By click­ing on a doc­u­ment ready for sign­ing on a com­puter within the dig­i­tal doc­u­ment plat­form, a unique QR code will be launched.</p>
    <p>Users then call up the SingPass Mo­bile app on their phone and launch a func­tion to scan the QR code to ini­ti­ate a sign­ing re­quest.</p>
    <p>The sig­na­ture is en­crypted and linked to the signee, whose iden­tity is au­to­mat­i­cally val­i­dated against the Gov­ern­ment’s database at the point of sign­ing.</p>
    <p>At the same time, the SingPass Mo­bile app will scan the user’s face or fin­ger­print to au­then­ti­cate and com­plete the dig­i­tal sign­ing process.</p>
    <p>Con­fi­den­tial­ity is main­tained as the doc­u­ments can­not be trans­ferred be­tween th­ese plat­forms and GovTech.</p>
    <p>In­stead, only an en­crypted, ran­dom code rep­re­sent­ing the signed doc­u­ment will be trans­ferred.</p>
    <p>The Sin­ga­pore Land Au­thor­ity (SLA) is also pi­lot­ing the tech­nol­ogy for the dig­i­tal sign­ing of prop­erty caveats.</p>
    <p>Pri­vate-sec­tor or­gan­i­sa­tions keen to use Sign with SingPass can reg­is­ter their in­ter­est at https://go.gov.sg/sign. The ser­vice is free for now.</p>
    <p>Speak­ing at yes­ter­day’s ERA event, Min­is­ter for Na­tional De­vel­op­ment Des­mond Lee urged the real es­tate sec­tor to take charge of and push ahead with dig­i­tal­i­sa­tion ef­forts to bet­ter serve cus­tomers.</p>
    <p>“To sur­vive and do well in a dig­i­tal era, (prop­erty agen­cies) will need to en­sure that both your real es­tate pro­fes­sion­als and your tech­ni­cal teams, who build and sup­port your dig­i­tal plat­forms, re­ceive the nec­es­sary train­ing,” said Mr Lee, who is also Min­is­ter in-charge of so­cial ser­vices in­te­gra­tion.</p>
    <p>“Like­wise, in­di­vid­ual prop­erty agents must take charge of your own learning, and be proac­tive in up­skilling your­selves.”</p>
    <p>ERA is also launch­ing a What­sApp-based chat­bot, which calls up project in­for­ma­tion such as the num­ber of avail­able units for agents who need to in­put only a few key­words.</p>
    <p>Pre­vi­ously, the agents had to con­tact the sales­men in charge of a spe­cific project, or search for the in­for­ma­tion them­selves on ERA’s mo­bile plat­forms.</p>
    <p>The SingPass Mo­bile app will scan the user’s face or fin­ger­print to au­then­ti­cate and com­plete the dig­i­tal sign­ing process. Con­fi­den­tial­ity is main­tained as the doc­u­ments can­not be trans­ferred be­tween th­ese plat­forms and GovTech. In­stead, only an en­crypted, ran­dom code rep­re­sent­ing the signed doc­u­ment will be trans­ferred.</p>
