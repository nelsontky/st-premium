    <p>Since it was set up seven months ago, In­sta­gram page @mi­nor­i­tyvoices has gained 10,200 fol­low­ers. Through its 170 posts, which de­tail in­di­vid­u­als’ ex­pe­ri­ences of racism and dis­crim­i­na­tion in Sin­ga­pore, the ac­count has at­tracted hun­dreds of re­sponses, as users weigh in on these sto­ries.</p>
    <p>Plat­forms like this show how dis­cus­sions about race are al­ready tak­ing place, said grass­roots vol­un­teer Swedha Ra­jaram. How­ever, she has con­cerns about how in­clu­sive such con­ver­sa­tions are.</p>
    <p>The 24-year-old, who works in the tech in­dus­try, said: “Would the un­cle un­der the block go to In­sta­gram and fol­low an ac­count called @mi­nor­i­tyvoices, where mi­nori­ties talk about per­sonal things like bul­ly­ing as well as larger struc­tural things like job dis­crim­i­na­tion?</p>
    <p>“I un­der­stand the cau­tion. The ques­tion that of­ten comes up is where is the line, where is the outof-bounds (OB) marker?”</p>
    <p>She is not alone.</p>
    <p>The past few months have seen an uptick in con­ver­sa­tions on race – on­line as well as off­line.</p>
    <p>WHY NOW?</p>
    <p>By and large, Sin­ga­pore­ans have tended to tread cau­tiously or tip­toe around dis­cus­sions on race, given the sen­si­tiv­i­ties sur­round­ing the is­sue.</p>
    <p>For some, this ex­tends to ad­dress­ing in­ci­dents of dis­crim­i­na­tion in a more low-key man­ner, pre­fer­ring to change per­cep­tions that may be held by school­mates, col­leagues and neigh­bours in a more grad­ual or sub­tle way.</p>
    <p>But the younger gen­er­a­tion seems more in­clined to ad­dress and have dif­fi­cult con­ver­sa­tions on these is­sues openly, ob­servers note.</p>
    <p>One fac­tor is the im­me­di­acy of so­cial me­dia and its wide­spread use, which means many users are quick to flag and call out in­ci­dents of bias.</p>
    <p>An­other fac­tor: the global dis­cus­sions that are tak­ing place on the sub­ject – such as the Black Lives Mat­ter move­ment in Amer­ica and talk of ma­jor­ity priv­i­lege.</p>
    <p>Both fac­tors have gen­er­ated a back­lash from some quar­ters.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore’s gen­eral elec­tion this year also saw the topic sur­face, when Face­book posts by Work­ers’ Party can­di­date Raeesah Khan – now an MP for Sengkang GRC – on for­eign­ers flout­ing safe dis­tanc­ing rules be­came the sub­ject of po­lice re­ports. Ms Raeesah had asked if the law dif­fered for “rich Chi­nese or white peo­ple”.</p>
    <p>Her re­marks drew push­back from some, and she apol­o­gised on July 5, say­ing she had no in­ten­tion to cause so­cial divi­sion and wanted only to raise aware­ness about mi­nor­ity is­sues.</p>
    <p>Ms Raeesah was is­sued a stern warn­ing in Septem­ber af­ter the po­lice con­cluded their in­ves­ti­ga­tions.</p>
    <p>In an on­line rally on July 8, Prime Min­is­ter Lee Hsien Loong ac­knowl­edged that younger Sin­ga­pore­ans have dif­fer­ent per­spec­tives on the is­sues of race and reli­gion, say­ing that these are valid and need to be taken into ac­count, as this gen­er­a­tion will one day in­herit the coun­try.</p>
    <p>How­ever, he noted that such mat­ters can cause um­brage, and should there­fore be han­dled del­i­cately.</p>
    <p>The is­sue was also touched on by Pres­i­dent Hal­imah Ya­cob a month later, at the open­ing of Par­lia­ment.</p>
    <p>She said the will­ing­ness of young peo­ple to talk about is­sues like race was a pos­i­tive de­vel­op­ment, but urged re­straint and mu­tual re­spect in such con­ver­sa­tions, as these “will al­ways be vis­ceral sub­jects”.</p>
    <p>RISKS AND RE­WARDS</p>
    <p>Ob­servers agree on the need for more open dis­cus­sion on the topic, say­ing that while there are risks, con­ver­sa­tions that are well guided could re­sult in bet­ter un­der­stand­ing of the con­cerns of peo­ple of dif­fer­ent races.</p>
    <p>Given how sen­si­tive the is­sue of race con­tin­ues to be to many here, there is a dan­ger of un­reg­u­lated on­line con­ver­sa­tion lead­ing to desta­bil­is­ing out­comes for so­ci­ety, said Sin­ga­pore Man­age­ment Univer­sity (SMU) as­so­ciate pro­fes­sor of law Eu­gene Tan, who added that plat­forms where par­tic­i­pants’ iden­ti­ties are not known can be dicey.</p>
    <p>“That would be throw­ing cau­tion to the wind and a po­ten­tial recipe for trou­ble,” he said.</p>
    <p>“The vi­ral­ity and viril­ity of an in­ap­pro­pri­ate re­mark made on­line must not be taken lightly.”</p>
    <p>Na­tional Univer­sity of Sin­ga­pore (NUS) so­ci­ol­o­gist Tan Ern Ser shared these views, adding that on­line cir­cles tend to be­come echo cham­bers.</p>
    <p>“Peo­ple tend to take pot­shots, and mu­tu­ally en­cour­age one an­other to do so; while those with op­pos­ing views are can­celled out, lead­ing to their drop­ping out of the cir­cle al­to­gether,” he said.</p>
    <p>In spite of these reser­va­tions, ob­servers say there are ben­e­fits to hav­ing more open con­ver­sa­tions.</p>
    <p>One ap­proach, sug­gested by SMU’s Prof Tan, is to en­able par­tic­i­pants to speak freely but also re­spon­si­bly in rel­a­tively con­trolled en­vi­ron­ments where ev­ery­one is pre­pared to con­sider, with an open mind, per­spec­tives that are dif­fer­ent from theirs.</p>
    <p>Ms Za­rina Yu­sof, ex­ec­u­tive di­rec­tor of non-profit com­mu­nity group AMP Sin­ga­pore, feels such safe spa­ces will help bridge the gap be­tween groups that may have po­larised views on the sub­ject.</p>
    <p>“We should be think­ing of a plat­form to bridge dif­fer­ent groups,” she said.</p>
    <p>“It has to be in a con­trolled en­vi­ron­ment, and dis­cus­sions should have some struc­ture – be closely guided and fa­cil­i­tated.”</p>
    <p>NUS’ Prof Tan sug­gests hav­ing more data from re­li­able sources form the ba­sis for such dis­cus­sions, and for goals to be set on where they should lead to.</p>
    <p>An in­for­mal opin­ion poll by con­ver­sa­tion en­gage­ment plat­form OPPi of more than 500 Straits Times read­ers on race found a strong in­ter­est in the topic; many felt there should be more open dis­cus­sions, but with some cau­tion.</p>
    <p>Some of these con­ver­sa­tions are al­ready tak­ing place. OnePeo­ple.sg, a na­tional body that seeks to strengthen racial har­mony, has worked with var­i­ous part­ners, in­clud­ing the me­dia, to or­gan­ise a se­ries of re­cent dia­logues.</p>
    <p>At these ses­sions, in­stances of racism and dis­crim­i­na­tion and how they can be bet­ter tack­led are of­ten dis­cussed.</p>
    <p>GUID­ING THE CON­VER­SA­TION</p>
    <p>Can Sin­ga­pore­ans have such con­ver­sa­tions in a way that does not just air griev­ances or raise ten­sions, but takes the dis­cus­sion for­ward and throws up so­lu­tions?</p>
    <p>An ob­server says fram­ing of the is­sue, and medium, can make a dif­fer­ence.</p>
    <p>Dr Nazry Bahrawi, a se­nior lec­turer at the Sin­ga­pore Univer­sity of Tech­nol­ogy and De­sign, sug­gests hav­ing pro­fes­sion­als trained in men­tal health is­sues be in­volved in con­ver­sa­tions on race, so that dis­cus­sions can be ap­proached from a care and ther­apy lens.</p>
    <p>They could also in­volve the arts, like lit­er­a­ture and films, which Dr Nazry, a board mem­ber of the In­ter­cul­tural The­atre In­sti­tute, said can al­low peo­ple to en­gage with dif­fi­cult is­sues with more nu­ance and sen­si­tiv­ity than at pub­lic sem­i­nars.</p>
    <p>One way to en­sure such dis­cus­sions are pro­duc­tive is to recog­nise</p>
    <p>that dis­crim­i­na­tion hap­pens in Sin­ga­pore, said Dr Nazry.</p>
    <p>In­stead of re­jec­tion, there should be an ac­knowl­edge­ment of lived ex­pe­ri­ences of dis­crim­i­na­tion, no mat­ter how dif­fi­cult it might be to hear.</p>
    <p>“Racial is­sues can­not be viewed in iso­la­tion from other facets of so­cial in­equal­ity, in­clud­ing eco­nom­ics and gen­der,” he said.</p>
    <p>“The recog­ni­tion of such in­ter­sec­tions can al­low us to be holis­tic when try­ing to craft poli­cies or so­lu­tions.”</p>
    <p>Ms Swedha added that dis­cus­sions on race should go beyond a “ba­sic and to­kenis­tic” level.</p>
    <p>She cited how some of her In­dian friends’ class­mates made dis­parag­ing re­marks about them, only to ap­proach them a day be­fore Racial Har­mony Day to ask for help to tie a sari or for some mu­ruku.</p>
    <p>She said: “It’s im­por­tant not to take the most palat­able parts of our cul­ture, try it on for a day, then dis­card it when you have no use for it.”</p>
    <p>Ob­servers are in agree­ment that, to take dis­cus­sions on race for­ward, there is a need to move beyond tol­er­ance of dif­fer­ing views</p>
    <p>and to­wards un­der­stand­ing and ap­pre­ci­at­ing such dif­fer­ences.</p>
    <p>Op­pos­ing views should be given air­time and, in dis­cus­sions, goals should be set to re­solve is­sues or prob­lems that have been iden­ti­fied, said NUS’ Prof Tan.</p>
    <p>These dif­fer­ences mean that race will re­main a sen­si­tive topic, given how they can eas­ily arouse un­hap­pi­ness and gen­er­ate mis­un­der­stand­ing or even in­cite con­fronta­tion, added SMU’s Prof Tan.</p>
    <p>He be­lieves Sin­ga­pore’s good progress on racial and re­li­gious ties should give it the con­fi­dence to “em­bark with cau­tious op­ti­mism” on more ro­bust dis­cus­sions.</p>
    <p>“Pre­cisely be­cause race, reli­gion and lan­guage are sen­si­tive is­sues, all the more we need to en­gage them for bet­ter so­cial co­he­sion,” he said. “It re­quires us to be mind­ful and to en­sure that any dis­cus­sion is done with re­spect, pa­tience, and ac­cord­ing dig­nity to all par­tic­i­pants, even if there are dis­agree­ments with their po­si­tions or per­spec­tives.”</p>
