    <p>SEOUL • Lovers of K-dra­mas and K-va­ri­ety shows may have to wait a lit­tle bit longer for new episodes of their favourite se­ries as film­ing and pro­duc­tion sched­ules have been af­fected by South Korea’s resur­gent Covid-19 in­fec­tions, mostly linked to church gath­er­ings.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to South Korean en­ter­tain­ment news por­tal Soompi, broad­caster SBS an­nounced on Monday that its pop­u­lar va­ri­ety se­ries Run­ning Man (2010 to now) and Master In The House (2017 to now) have halted film­ing tem­po­rar­ily for the “health and safety of the cast and crew”.</p>
    <p>K-drama pro­duc­tion and devel­op­ment pow­er­house Stu­dio Dragon, which was be­hind beloved ti­tles like It’s Okay To Not Be Okay (2020), Crash Land­ing On You (2019) and Goblin (2016), also an­nounced that it will halt all film­ing from Aug 24 to 31.</p>
    <p>A state­ment re­leased by Stu­dio Dragon’s par­ent com­pany CJ ENM said the move may af­fect the broad­cast sched­ules of cur­rently air­ing se­ries like the mys­tery thriller Miss­ing: The Other Side and the Lee Joon-gi and Moon Chae-won ve­hi­cle Flower Of Evil, which is avail­able in Sin­ga­pore via Viu, iQiyi and tvN chan­nel.</p>
    <p>But the hotly an­tic­i­pated ro­mance drama Record Of Youth, star­ring Park Bo-gum and Os­car­win­ning Par­a­site (2019) ac­tress Park So-dam, will still be re­leased on sched­ule as film­ing has al­ready wrapped.</p>
    <p>It is slated to premiere in­ter­na­tion­ally on stream­ing ser­vice Net­flix on Sept 7, but a press con­fer­ence for re­gional me­dia, in­clud­ing Sin­ga­pore’s, and the drama’s leads has been can­celled due to the resur­gent pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Sea­son 2 of Stranger, which re­cently pre­miered on Net­flix, will also con­tinue to air un­af­fected.</p>
    <p>In ad­di­tion, CJ ENM an­nounced that its live music pro­gramme M Count­down will stop air­ing un­til fur­ther no­tice.</p>
    <p>Other af­fected se­ries i nclude broad­caster KBS’ Do Do Sol Sol La La Sol and Zom­bie De­tec­tive, which will now premiere later than orig­i­nally sched­uled.</p>
    <p>The cur­rently air­ing To All The Guys Who Loved Me, avail­able in Sin­ga­pore on Viki, has re­sumed film­ing af­ter one of its sup­port­ing ac­tors Seo Sung-jong was di­ag­nosed with Covid-19 last Wed­nes­day.</p>
