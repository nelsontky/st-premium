    <p>• Manch­ester City have launched an in­ves­ti­ga­tion into re­ports France de­fender Ben­jamin Mendy flouted coro­n­avirus rules by host­ing a gath­er­ing at his house on New Year’s Eve.</p>
    <p>The 26-year-old al­lowed a chef and two friends of his part­ner to visit his Cheshire home, ac­cord­ing to The Sun. Bri­tish reg­u­la­tions pre­vent peo­ple from dif­fer­ent house­holds un­der Tier 4 re­stric­tions from mix­ing in­doors due to the con­tin­ued spread of Covid-19.</p>
    <p>City said they were dis­ap­pointed by Mendy’s be­hav­iour and will look into the lat­est virus breach in­volv­ing a Pre­mier League star.</p>
    <p>“While it is un­der­stood that el­e­ments of this in­ci­dent have been mis­in­ter­preted in the re­ports, and that the player has pub­licly apol­o­gised for his er­ror, the club is dis­ap­pointed to learn of the trans­gres­sion and will be con­duct­ing an in­ter­nal in­ves­ti­ga­tion,” a City spokesman said.</p>
    <p>A spokesman for Mendy said: “Ben ac­cepts that this is a breach of Covid-19 pro­to­cols and is sorry for his ac­tions in this mat­ter.”</p>
    <p>City are among the clubs to have suf­fered an out­break within their squad in re­cent days, with last Mon­day’s match at Ever­ton post­poned af­ter five play­ers were in­fected. Yes­ter­day, the club con­firmed an­other case in Eric Gar­cia as well as an­other staff mem­ber.</p>
    <p>Crys­tal Palace boss Roy Hodgson re­vealed his dis­ap­point­ment af­ter Luka Milivo­je­vic, along with Ful­ham’s Alek­san­dar Mitro­vic were pic­tured at a New Year’s Eve party in breach of the mea­sures.</p>
    <p>Ful­ham, whose games against Tot­ten­ham and Burn­ley were post­poned due to out­breaks in their camp, also ex­pressed their dis­ap­point­ment with Mitro­vic.</p>
    <p>On Satur­day, pic­tures emerged of Tot­ten­ham trio Erik Lamela, Ser­gio Reguilon and Gio­vani lo Celso at­tend­ing a large house party in Lon­don over the Christ­mas pe­riod, with the club say­ing they would face in­ter­nal dis­ci­plinary ac­tion. Manuel Lanzini, who was also present at that gath­er­ing, was con­trite on so­cial me­dia, while West Ham said the mat­ter had been dealt with in­ter­nally.</p>
    <p>Four league games have al­ready been post­poned due to out­breaks this sea­son.</p>
