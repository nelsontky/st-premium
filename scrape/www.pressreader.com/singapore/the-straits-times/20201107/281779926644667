    <p>Any­one en­ter­ing Sin­ga­pore from Mon­day who has trav­elled in the past two weeks to Es­to­nia and Nor­way will have to serve a stay-home no­tice (SHN) at ded­i­cated fa­cil­i­ties.</p>
    <p>The Min­istry of Health (MOH) said yes­ter­day that these trav­ellers will have to serve the twoweek no­tice even if they had ob­tained ap­proval to opt out ear­lier.</p>
    <p>This is due to the sharp in­crease in Covid-19 cases in Es­to­nia and Nor­way re­cently.</p>
    <p>Es­to­nia reg­is­tered a record daily in­crease of 241 new coro­n­avirus cases yes­ter­day, bring­ing the coun­try’s to­tal tally to 5,705.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, Nor­way on Thurs­day an­nounced new curbs that will place lim­its on so­cial gath­er­ings and ed­u­ca­tion, among other things, from to­day. It has recorded over 22,500 virus cases so far.</p>
    <p>Pre­vi­ously, on Oct 27, MOH said that trav­ellers from these two coun­tries were al­lowed to serve the stay-home no­tice at a suit­able place of res­i­dence.</p>
    <p>MOH said trav­ellers from Fiji, Fin­land, Ja­pan, South Korea, Sri Lanka, Thai­land and Turkey can still ap­ply to opt out of ded­i­cated stay-home no­tice fa­cil­i­ties and serve the 14-day no­tice at their place of res­i­dence. How­ever, this is pro­vided they have not trav­elled to coun­tries apart from the ones men­tioned here in the 14 days prior to en­try.</p>
    <p>They must also serve their no­tice in their place of res­i­dence alone, or only with house­hold mem­bers who are also serv­ing stay-home no­tices and have the same travel his­tory and du­ra­tion.</p>
    <p>Trav­ellers from these coun­tries have been able to ap­ply to opt out of ded­i­cated stay-home no­tice fa­cil­i­ties from last Mon­day.</p>
    <p>MOH said that as the global sit­u­a­tion evolves, it will con­tinue to ad­just bor­der mea­sures to man­age the risk of the im­port and spread of Covid-19 in the com­mu­nity.</p>
    <p>Trav­ellers are ad­vised to visit the Safe Travel Of­fice web­site to check for the most up­dated bor­der mea­sures be­fore en­ter­ing Sin­ga­pore and be pre­pared to be sub­ject to the pre­vail­ing bor­der mea­sures on en­try, tests and treat­ment.</p>
