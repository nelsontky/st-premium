    <p>Brexit of­fers Bri­tain a chance to do things dif­fer­ently in fi­nan­cial ser­vices, Fi­nance Min­is­ter Rishi Su­nak said yes­ter­day, but the coun­try will co­op­er­ate with the Euro­pean Union on an ap­proach to the sec­tor de­spite lit­tle de­tail on the topic in its trade deal.</p>
    <p>Prime Min­is­ter Boris John­son said Bri­tain, though, would not “di­verge for the sake of di­verg­ing”.</p>
    <p>•</p>
    <p>LON­DON Prime Min­is­ter Boris John­son has said ma­jor changes are com­ing in Bri­tain as a re­sult of the trade deal his gov­ern­ment ne­go­ti­ated with the Euro­pean Union (EU), com­plet­ing the coun­try’s sep­a­ra­tion from the bloc, the Tele­graph re­ported.</p>
    <p>“We can’t sort of sud­denly de­cide that we’re free and then not de­cide how to ex­er­cise it,” he told the Sun­day Tele­graph in his first in­ter­view since the deal was reached last Thurs­day.</p>
    <p>“This gov­ern­ment has a very clear agenda to unite and level up and to spread op­por­tu­nity across the coun­try.”</p>
    <p>The agree­ment on the exit from the EU’s sin­gle mar­ket and Cus­toms union will al­low for tar­if­fand quota-free trade in goods af­ter this Thurs­day. It does not ap­ply to the ser­vice in­dus­try – about 80 per cent of the Bri­tish econ­omy – or fi­nan­cial ser­vices.</p>
    <p>The deal es­tab­lishes a new frame­work for busi­nesses on both sides of the Chan­nel that leaves Bri­tish com­pa­nies fac­ing more bar­ri­ers to trade than they did while Bri­tain was a mem­ber of the EU, though it also frees the Bri­tish Par­lia­ment from many of the con­straints im­posed by EU mem­ber­ship.</p>
    <p>Now that it has gained more free­dom to in­de­pen­dently set reg­u­la­tions, and fi­nan­cial and im­mi­gra­tion pol­icy, Bri­tain would not “di­verge for the sake of di­verg­ing”, Mr</p>
    <p>John­son said.</p>
    <p>On the con­trary, he added, his gov­ern­ment would “do things dif­fer­ently where that’s use­ful for the Bri­tish peo­ple”.</p>
    <p>He said his threats to walk away from the talks and al­low Bri­tain to crash out of the EU this Fri­day were gen­uine and not a ne­go­ti­at­ing tac­tic. The deal was reached be­cause EU ne­go­tia­tors knew that Bri­tain would act with “ab­so­lute con­vic­tion” and “get up and walk away”, he pointed out.</p>
    <p>Bri­tish ne­go­tia­tors were able to “neuter” EU ef­forts to bind Bri­tain to move in lock­step in terms of set­ting stan­dards in the fu­ture.</p>
    <p>Those ef­forts by the EU have been “greatly wa­tered down”, said Mr John­son.</p>
    <p>The EU also faces lit­tle risk of Bri­tain slap­ping tar­iffs on its goods in ar­eas where Bri­tish reg­u­la­tions are stricter than those of the EU.</p>
    <p>“We could do it... but we’d be un­likely to do it be­cause we don’t re­ally be­lieve in tar­iffs,” he told the news­pa­per.</p>
    <p>“We be­lieve in high stan­dards. If the EU did some­thing like that, it would have to be pro­por­tion­ate and ap­proved by the ar­bi­tra­tor.”</p>
    <p>Mr David Frost, Bri­tain’s chief Brexit ne­go­tia­tor, hailed the free­trade agree­ment, telling re­porters on a call on Satur­day: “This should be the be­gin­ning of a mo­ment of na­tional renewal for us.”</p>
    <p>He noted that Bri­tain can set “its own laws again”.</p>
    <p>Brexit of­fers Bri­tain a chance to do things dif­fer­ently in fi­nan­cial ser­vices, Fi­nance Min­is­ter Rishi Su­nak said yes­ter­day, but it will co­op­er­ate with the EU on an ap­proach to the sec­tor – de­spite lit­tle de­tail on the topic in the trade agree­ment.</p>
    <p>From this Fri­day, Bri­tish-based fi­nan­cial ser­vices groups lose au­to­matic ac­cess to the EU’s sin­gle mar­ket, and both sides have said new mar­ket ac­cess must be ne­go­ti­ated out­side the trade agree­ment in spe­cific equiv­a­lence deals.</p>
    <p>The two sides will aim to agree a mem­o­ran­dum of un­der­stand­ing on reg­u­la­tory co­op­er­a­tion in fi­nan­cial ser­vices by March next year, and Mr Su­nak said such lan­guage should pro­vide re­as­sur­ance.</p>
    <p>“This deal also pro­vides re­as­sur­ance be­cause there’s a sta­ble reg­u­la­tory co­op­er­a­tive frame­work men­tioned in the deal,” he added.</p>
    <p>“I think (that) will give peo­ple re­as­sur­ance that we will re­main in close di­a­logue with our Euro­pean part­ners when it comes to things like equiv­a­lence de­ci­sions.”</p>
    <p>We can’t sort of sud­denly de­cide that we’re free and then not de­cide how to ex­er­cise it. This gov­ern­ment has a very clear agenda to unite and level up and to spread op­por­tu­nity across the coun­try. BRI­TISH PRIME MIN­IS­TER BORIS JOHN­SON</p>
