    <p>• Asia-Pa­cific has faced a record num­ber of cli­mate-re­lated dis­as­ters this year, af­fect­ing tens of mil­lions of vul­ner­a­ble peo­ple al­ready hit hard by the Covid-19 pan­demic, the Red Cross said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The In­ter­na­tional Fed­er­a­tion of Red Cross and Red Cres­cent So­ci­eties (IFRC) said it had re­sponded to 24 cli­mate-linked crises this year in the world’s most dis­as­ter-prone re­gion – up from 18 last year – in­clud­ing floods, ty­phoons, ex­treme cold and drought.</p>
    <p>“Covid-19 has, of course, ag­gra­vated these im­pacts, with a taste of the com­pound shocks we’re ex­pect­ing in a chang­ing cli­mate,” di­rec­tor of the Red Cross Red Cres­cent Cli­mate Cen­tre Maarten van Aalst told Thom­son Reuters Foun­da­tion.</p>
    <p>“The pan­demic has not only com­pli­cated evac­u­a­tions and dis­as­ter re­sponse, but also ag­gra­vates the eco­nomic im­pact of dis­as­ters, es­pe­cially for the poor­est peo­ple,” he added.</p>
    <p>South-east Asia was the IFRC’s busiest re­gion this year, with 15 emer­gency re­sponses to dis­as­ters, in­clud­ing se­vere floods, storms and land­slides in the Philip­pines and Viet­nam that af­fected more than 31 mil­lion peo­ple.</p>
    <p>The IFRC’s emer­gency op­er­a­tions man­ager Jess Letch said the chal­lenge had been to help com­mu­ni­ties with re­lief aid while also tak­ing the steps needed to halt the spread of Covid-19.</p>
    <p>Re­silience project man­ager Mary Joy Gonzales with Care in the Philip­pines said her aid agency had worked to pro­vide ad­di­tional shel­ter to en­able so­cial dis­tanc­ing af­ter one per­son con­tracted Covid-19 in an evac­u­a­tion cen­tre it was sup­port­ing.</p>
    <p>Women have suf­fered a triple blow, she added, with the pan­demic fu­elling vi­o­lence at home just as many lost their jobs and had to look af­ter out-of­school chil­dren and el­derly rel­a­tives while the coun­try was pum­melled by de­struc­tive storms.</p>
    <p>The agency ex­pected that such im­pacts “will get worse due to cli­mate change”, she told jour­nal­ists ear­lier this month.</p>
    <p>“We have seen the trend in the past 10 years: Ty­phoons have been be­com­ing stronger and we have lost thou­sands of lives al­ready,” she said.</p>
    <p>Last year, more than 94 mil­lion peo­ple in the Asia-Pa­cific re­gion were hit by cli­mate-re­lated dis­as­ters, with the area ex­pe­ri­enc­ing twice as many emer­gen­cies as the Amer­i­cas or Africa, ac­cord­ing to the IFRC’s lat­est World Dis­as­ters Re­port.</p>
    <p>The to­tal num­ber of peo­ple af­fected this year has not yet been re­leased.</p>
    <p>Home to about 60 per cent of the world’s pop­u­la­tion, the Asia-Pa­cific re­gion has borne the brunt of cli­mate dis­as­ters, with many peo­ple liv­ing in vul­ner­a­ble con­di­tions due to poverty and poor ur­ban plan­ning.</p>
    <p>Pro­fes­sor van Aalst said coun­tries had be­come bet­ter pre­pared and equipped to save lives, but were still fail­ing to pro­tect the liveli­hoods of vul­ner­a­ble com­mu­ni­ties struck by dis­as­ters.</p>
    <p>He cited the ex­am­ple of Cy­clone Am­phan that bat­tered In­dia and Bangladesh in May. Mass evac­u­a­tions be­fore the storm made land­fall pre­vented a large num­ber of deaths.</p>
    <p>But the im­pact on eco­nomic well-be­ing was harsh, es­pe­cially for the poor­est, he noted, with to­tal dam­age es­ti­mated at more than US$13 bil­lion (S$17.3 bil­lion).</p>
    <p>In Viet­nam, Care’s coun­try di­rec­tor Le Kim Dung said the pan­demic had made it harder to bounce back, par­tic­u­larly in ru­ral ar­eas, from widespread floods that had in­un­dated many prov­inces hit by heavy rain and a se­ries of ty­phoons since early Oc­to­ber.</p>
