    <p>•</p>
    <p>NEW YORK Or­a­cle Corp con­firmed yes­ter­day that it was part of a pro­posal made by TikTok par­ent ByteDance to the US gov­ern­ment to be­come a tech­nol­ogy part­ner of the Chi­nese firm.</p>
    <p>In a state­ment, the firm said “it is part of the pro­posal sub­mit­ted by ByteDance to the Trea­sury Depart­ment over the weekend”.</p>
    <p>Ear­lier, peo­ple fa­mil­iar with the mat­ter said Or­a­cle had beat Mi­crosoft in the bat­tle for the US arm of TikTok with a deal struc­tured as a part­ner­ship rather than an out­right sale to try to nav­i­gate ten­sions be­tween Bei­jing and Wash­ing­ton.</p>
    <p>US Trea­sury Sec­re­tary Steven Mnuchin yes­ter­day said the Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion had re­ceived a pro­posal from Or­a­cle over the weekend to make TikTok a US-head­quar­tered com­pany, and will re­view the plan this week.</p>
    <p>“We have a lot of confidence in both Mi­crosoft and Or­a­cle. They’ve cho­sen Or­a­cle. We’ll be re­view­ing it with their tech­ni­cal teams and our tech­ni­cal teams to see if they can make the rep­re­sen­ta­tions” to keep data on Amer­i­can phones safe, Mr Mnuchin told CNBC tele­vi­sion.</p>
    <p>ByteDance had been in talks to di­vest the US busi­ness of its hugely pop­u­lar short-video app to Or­a­cle or a con­sor­tium led by Mi­crosoft after US Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump or­dered the sale last month and said he might oth­er­wise shut it down.</p>
    <p>While TikTok is best known for danc­ing videos that go vi­ral among teenagers, US of­fi­cials are con­cerned user in­for­ma­tion could be passed to China’s gov­ern­ment.</p>
    <p>TikTok, which has as many as 100 mil­lion US users, has said it would never share such data with the Chi­nese au­thor­i­ties.</p>
    <p>The data is cur­rently stored in Al­pha­bet Inc’s cloud.</p>
    <p>Sale ne­go­ti­a­tions were up­ended when China up­dated its ex­port con­trol rules last month, giv­ing it a say over the trans­fer of TikTok’s al­go­rithm to a for­eign buyer.</p>
    <p>Reuters re­ported last week that China would rather see TikTok shut down in the United States than al­low a forced sale.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, China’s state-run English tele­vi­sion chan­nel CGTN cited sources as say­ing ByteDance would not sell TikTok’s US op­er­a­tions to</p>
    <p>Or­a­cle or Mi­crosoft, and would not give the source code for the plat­form to any US firm.</p>
    <p>It is un­clear whether Mr Trump, who wants a US tech­nol­ogy firm to own most of TikTok in the coun­try, will ap­prove the deal. The Com­mit­tee on For­eign In­vest­ment in the US, which re­views deals for na­tional se­cu­rity risk, is over­see­ing the ByteDance-Or­a­cle talks.</p>
    <p>Reg­u­la­tory lawyer John Kabealo, who is not in­volved in the talks, said: “User data protection and as­sur­ances around how the com­pany’s al­go­rithms push con­tent to US users are thought­ful com­po­nents of a sub­stan­tive so­lu­tion, but whether they can change po­lit­i­cal out­comes is a much more dif­fi­cult ques­tion.”</p>
    <p>China’s for­eign mi n i s t r y spokesman Wang Wen­bin de­clined to com­ment yes­ter­day when asked about the deal, but said TikTok was be­ing “en­cir­cled” and “co­erced” in the US into a trans­ac­tion.</p>
    <p>“We urge the US gov­ern­ment to pro­vide an open, fair, just and nondis­crim­i­na­tory en­vi­ron­ment for for­eign firms op­er­at­ing and in­vest­ing in the United States,” he said.</p>
