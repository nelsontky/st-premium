    <p>The Volk­swa­gen Polo is a cute lit­tle car. But be­cause of its com­pact­ness, it ap­peals mostly to sin­gles, new­ly­weds and empty nesters.</p>
    <p>To widen its ap­peal, Volk­swa­gen has built an­other car on its plat­form, made it a lit­tle big­ger, styled it like a sport util­ity ve­hi­cle and given it a jazzy hy­phen­ated name.</p>
    <p>The T-Cross (pre­vi­ously known as the CrossPolo) is the small­est cross­over in the VW fam­ily, but it is pretty big on util­ity.</p>
    <p>While its wheel­base is iden­ti­cal to the Polo’s 2,551mm, it is longer, wider and ap­pre­cia­bly taller.</p>
    <p>This gives it more room. In the sec­ond row, for in­stance, oc­cu­pants get a big­ger footwell and slightly more legroom be­cause the seats are an­chored dif­fer­ently from the Polo’s, and the front seats are raised well above the floor.</p>
    <p>The rear seats are also raised. To­gether with a higher ceil­ing and a tad more width, the cabin is more spa­cious than di­men­sion changes sug­gest.</p>
    <p>Far­ther back, you will find a size­able boot of 385 litres (ver­sus the Polo’s 351 litres). The rear seats can slide for­ward to in­crease stowage to 455 litres – com­pa­ra­ble with what you get in some mid­size cars. Fold down the back of the 60:40 split rear seats and you will get a hard-to-match 1,281 litres of cargo-car­ry­ing space.</p>
    <p>On these counts, the T-Cross is a far more prac­ti­cal car than the Polo which it is based on.</p>
    <p>Gro­cery runs, Ikea trips and bi­cy­cle out­ings with foldies are a cinch with the T-Cross, but a chal­lenge with its donor car. So there is no ar­gu­ment which car is more fam­ily-friendly.</p>
    <p>But what about the driver? Firstly, the T-Cross is still a com­pact car de­spite be­ing slightly big­ger than the Polo, so it re­mains ma­noeu­vrable in the city. Its higher seat­ing po­si­tion also gives the driver bet­ter vis­i­bil­ity.</p>
    <p>What is not so good is that the car is still pow­ered by the Polo’s 999cc three-cylin­der en­gine.</p>
    <p>The Polo is al­ready quite leisurely with this power plant. Be­ing big­ger and heav­ier, the T-Cross is of­ten lethar­gic.</p>
    <p>But if you drive it in Sport mode, the car is more brisk. This will re­sult</p>
    <p>in higher fuel con­sump­tion, but that is a small price to pay for bet­ter drive­abil­ity.</p>
    <p>The test-car av­er­ages 7.9 litres/ 100km, ver­sus VW’s stated 5.2 litres/100km and the Polo’s tested 6 litres/100km.</p>
    <p>Throt­tle re­sponse is not lin­ear, of­ten ex­hibit­ing a power void in the first few de­grees of pedal travel. This can be in­fu­ri­at­ing in many sit­u­a­tions, in­clud­ing oc­ca­sions when you are park­ing.</p>
    <p>But you soon learn that the car creeps strongly and all you have to do is mod­u­late the brakes (also a prac­tised art since they tend to have an all-or-noth­ing be­hav­iour). The car’s creep­ing power is so strong that it will climb a steep carpark ramp with­out you touch­ing the throt­tle.</p>
    <p>This might be use­ful off-road, but the T-Cross is a front-wheel-drive and, like most crossovers, it is not suited for se­ri­ous off-road­ing.</p>
    <p>But on the whole, you get a well­built, stylish car which has enough space for small fam­i­lies.</p>
    <p>And de­spite its lack of verve and higher-than-ex­pected con­sump­tion, it of­fers more-than-de­cent ride and han­dling, which is not some­thing you can say for all crossovers.</p>
