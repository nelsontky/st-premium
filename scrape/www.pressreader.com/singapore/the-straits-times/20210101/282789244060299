    <p>BILLIE EILISH’S ‘NUDE’ POSTS DRAW IRE:</p>
    <p>Amer­i­can singer Billie Eilish said the peo­ple who un­fol­lowed her on In­sta­gram were “ba­bies”, af­ter she posted draw­ings of breasts on so­cial me­dia.</p>
    <p>Eilish, 19, was asked by fans on Tues­day to take up In­sta­gram’s Post a Pic­ture of… chal­lenge, and she obliged with a screen­grab of her iPhone’s lock screen, which shows a paint­ing of two nude women.</p>
    <p>Another fan asked her to post “a draw­ing you’re re­ally proud of” and she did so by post­ing a se­ries of sketches show­ing breasts, nip­ples and but­tocks.</p>
    <p>Some fans then no­ticed the Bad Guy singer lost about 100,000 fol­low­ers on In­sta­gram af­ter that.</p>
    <p>One of the fans posted a screenshot of Eilish’s fol­lower count and wrote on so­cial me­dia: “Bye not her los­ing 100k cuz of b**bs”.</p>
    <p>The num­ber of fol­low­ers on</p>
    <p>Eilish’s In­sta­gram ac­count fell from 73 mil­lion to 72.9 mil­lion in about half an hour, ac­cord­ing to var­i­ous me­dia out­lets.</p>
    <p>Eilish no­ticed the fan’s post too. She re­posted it on her In­sta­gram Story and wrote: “LMFAOOO y’all ba­bies smh.”</p>
    <p>It was un­clear, though, if the drop in the num­ber of fol­low­ers was re­ally due to her doo­dle or just a fluc­tu­a­tion in num­bers.</p>
    <p>The num­ber of fol­low­ers on her In­sta­gram seemed to have gone up again af­ter the lat­est episode. It was 73.1 mil­lion as of yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Last Oc­to­ber, the Gram­my­win­ning singer en­cour­aged her fans to “nor­malise real bodies” af­ter she was mocked by a Twit­ter user for wear­ing a tank-top.</p>
    <p>She dis­missed the body shamers in another me­dia in­ter­view last Novem­ber, say­ing: “This is how I look.”</p>
