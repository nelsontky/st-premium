    <p>WASH­ING­TON Of­fi­cials pleaded with Amer­i­cans on Tues­day to stay at home and re­dou­ble ef­forts to cur­tail the coro­n­avirus pan­demic, de­fend­ing un­pop­u­lar public health mea­sures as record hos­pi­tal­i­sa­tions pushed med­i­cal pro­fes­sion­als to the brink.</p>
    <p>“We are on fire with Covid,” Ken­tucky Gov­er­nor Andy Bes­hear said on CNN, speak­ing in sup­port of re­stric­tions im­posed last week that in­cluded new con­straints on re­tail ac­tiv­ity and school clo­sures. “We’re just try­ing to do the right thing.”</p>
    <p>The num­ber of pa­tients be­ing treated for coro­n­avirus in­fec­tions in United States hos­pi­tals sur­passed 86,000 on Tues­day, an all­time high, while 30 of the 50 states re­ported a record num­ber of Covid-19-re­lated hos­pi­tal­i­sa­tions this month.</p>
    <p>The soar­ing caseload has taxed al­ready ex­hausted health­care providers and fur­ther strained med­i­cal re­sources, as 171,000 Amer­i­cans test pos­i­tive and an­other 1,500 or more per­ish from Covid-19 ev­ery day, on av­er­age.</p>
    <p>US Sur­geon Gen­eral Jerome Adams urged the public to grasp “the sever­ity of the mo­ment” and re­main dili­gent in wear­ing face cov­er­ings, avoid­ing crowds and prac­tis­ing good hand hy­giene un­til newly de­vel­oped ther­a­peu­tic treat­ments and vac­cines can be made widely avail­able in the months ahead.</p>
    <p>“We just need you, the Amer­i­can peo­ple, to hold on a lit­tle bit longer,” Dr Adams, a White House coro­n­avirus task force mem­ber, told Fox News in an in­ter­view.</p>
    <p>He joined a cho­rus of health au­thor­i­ties call­ing for peo­ple to re­con­sider any plans to travel or to con­gre­gate in large groups be­yond their im­me­di­ate house­holds over the Thanks­giv­ing hol­i­day long week­end, which starts to­day.</p>
    <p>Cal­i­for­nia’s top health of­fi­cial, Dr Mark Ghaly, in his weekly public Covid-19 brief­ing on Tues­day, went as far as to of­fer up “Covid chat” talking points for po­litely but firmly de­clin­ing in­vi­ta­tions to fam­ily gath­er­ings that might be un­safe.</p>
    <p>“Say­ing ‘no’ to peo­ple you love is never easy... but know­ing how and when to say ‘no’ is the first step to pro­tect­ing your health and the health of the peo­ple you care about,” Dr Ghaly wrote.</p>
    <p>Gov­ern­ment data and pro­jec­tions from the Amer­i­can Au­to­mo­bile As­so­ci­a­tion show such pleas are be­ing widely dis­re­garded.</p>
    <p>Although fewer in num­ber than is typ­i­cal, mil­lions of Amer­i­cans have flocked to air­ports and high­ways in re­cent days, lead­ing to the busiest US travel pe­riod since the early days of the pan­demic in March.</p>
    <p>One travel com­pli­ca­tion may soon be re­laxed, as the US Cen­tres for Disease Con­trol and Preven­tion con­sid­ers short­en­ing its rec­om­mended 14-day quar­an­tine af­ter po­ten­tial ex­po­sure to the virus for in­di­vid­u­als who test neg­a­tive dur­ing their iso­la­tion.</p>
    <p>The health au­thor­i­ties also said this week that they ex­pect the first vac­cines to win US reg­u­la­tory ap­proval for dis­tri­bu­tion next month. The vac­cines will be­gin to be ad­min­is­tered to front-line health­care work­ers and other high-pri­or­ity in­di­vid­u­als by the middle of next month.</p>
    <p>How­ever, the shots are un­likely to be­come widely avail­able to the public on de­mand be­fore April or May, ex­perts have said.</p>
    <p>In the mean­time, doc­tors will soon have ad­di­tional med­i­cal treat­ments for Covid-19 at their dis­posal.</p>
    <p>A newly au­tho­rised an­ti­body com­bi­na­tion ther­apy from Re­gen­eron Phar­ma­ceu­ti­cals was due to be­gin US gov­ern­ment dis­tri­bu­tion on Tues­day.</p>
    <p>Af­ter an ini­tial wave of in­fec­tions cen­tred on and around ma­jor US ci­ties dur­ing spring, the Covid-19 pan­demic now has en­gulfed ru­ral and small-town Amer­ica.</p>
    <p>In­fec­tion rates in a dozen Mid­west­ern states have more than dou­bled those of any other re­gion, ac­cord­ing to the Covid Track­ing Project, soar­ing 20 times higher from mid-June to mid-Novem­ber.</p>
    <p>“Stay home, stay pro­tected and keep your­self and oth­ers well,” the Mis­sis­sippi State Depart­ment of Health said in a tweet on Tues­day.</p>
    <p>JUST SAY NO</p>
    <p>Say­ing ‘no’ to peo­ple you love is never easy ... but know­ing how and when to say ‘no’ is the first step to pro­tect­ing your health and the health of the peo­ple you care about.</p>
