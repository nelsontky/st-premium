    <p>• Thai­land has dropped crim­i­nal charges against the heir to the Red Bull en­ergy drink for­tune, who was ac­cused in a 2012 hit-an­drun killing of a po­lice of­fi­cer in a case that raised ques­tions about crime and pun­ish­ment for the well-con­nected.</p>
    <p>War­rants, in­clud­ing an In­ter­pol red no­tice, for the ar­rest of Mr Vo­rayuth “Boss” Yoovid­hya, whose where­abouts are not known, will be with­drawn, po­lice said.</p>
    <p>Mr Vo­rayuth, grand­son of the late Cha­leo Yoovid­hya, cre­ator of the Krat­ing Daeng, or Red Bull, en­ergy drink, had faced charges of speed­ing, hit-and-run and reck­less driv­ing caus­ing death, which had a statue of lim­i­ta­tions un­til 2027.</p>
    <p>“This case is over,” deputy po­lice spokesman Kis­sana Phathanach­aroen said at a news brief­ing.</p>
    <p>“In June, we re­ceived a fi­nal or­der from the at­tor­ney-gen­eral to not pros­e­cute Vo­rayuth on charges of reck­less driv­ing and caus­ing death,” he said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Mr Vo­rayuth was ac­cused of crash­ing his black Fer­rari into po­lice­man Wichien Klan­prasert, who was on a mo­tor­cy­cle i n Bangkok, and drag­ging his body for dozens of me­tres be­fore flee­ing the scene.</p>
    <p>He missed eight sum­monses to ap­pear in court in con­nec­tion with the case be­fore the au­thor­i­ties is­sued a war­rant for his ar­rest, five years af­ter the ac­ci­dent.</p>
    <p>He later fled to Sin­ga­pore on his pri­vate jet in 2017, days be­fore an ar­rest war­rant was is­sued over the in­ci­dent.</p>
    <p>Mr Vo­rayuth’s grand­fa­ther, Cha­leo, was listed as the third rich­est per­son in Thai­land at the time of his death in 2012, at the age of 88, with an es­ti­mated net worth of US$5 bil­lion (S$6.9 bil­lion), ac­cord­ing to Forbes mag­a­zine.</p>
    <p>Many Thais saw Mr Vo­rayuth’s treat­ment as le­nient be­cause of his fam­ily’s wealth, stir­ring de­bate over how the rich are treated.</p>
    <p>But Mr Kis­sana dis­missed any such sug­ges­tion yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>“This is not a (case of) dou­ble stan­dards,” he said, adding that the case could be re­opened if there was new ev­i­dence.</p>
    <p>“We are sad­dened by the loss of a fel­low po­lice of­fi­cer,” he said.</p>
    <p>It is not im­me­di­ately clear where Mr Vo­rayuth is now.</p>
    <p>How­ever, in the years since the in­ci­dent, he has been pho­tographed liv­ing a glam­orous life in London, among other places, as well as be­ing spot­ted par­ty­ing in Bangkok.</p>
    <p>PO­LICE DE­NIAL</p>
    <p>This is not a (case of) dou­ble stan­dards... We are sad­dened by the loss of ’’ a fel­low po­lice of­fi­cer. DEPUTY PO­LICE SPOKESMAN KIS­SANA PHATHANACH­AROEN, who dis­missed sug­ges­tions that the treat­ment of Vo­rayuth “Boss” Yoovid­hya (above) was le­nient be­cause of his fam­ily’s wealth, adding that the case could be re­opened if there is new ev­i­dence.</p>
