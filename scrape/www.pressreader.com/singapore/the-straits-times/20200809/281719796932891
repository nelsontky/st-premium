    <p>For Ms Zhuang Yaqi and Mr Ryan Liu, get­ting mar­ried on Aug 8 had been in the works for over a year – 0808 is “aus­pi­cious” and it is the day be­fore Na­tional Day.</p>
    <p>“It just feels like it’s an ex­tra fes­tive pe­riod, and the date is also very easy to re­mem­ber. We liked it from the start,” said Ms Zhuang, 30, who is an ac­count man­ager.</p>
    <p>The cou­ple de­cided to go ahead with their plans yesterday, de­spite re­stric­tions brought on by the on­go­ing coro­n­avirus pan­demic.</p>
    <p>They were among 240 cou­ples who tied the knot on the spe­cial date, up from the 44 cou­ples who did so on Aug 8 a year ago, a Thurs­day.</p>
    <p>Mr Liu, 26, a teacher, said: “When Covid-19 first broke in Jan­uary, we con­sid­ered post­pon­ing the wed­ding date, but as the months went on, and the pan­demic looked like it would stay, we de­cided to stick to the orig­i­nal plan. The pan­demic is a prob­lem, but we shouldn’t feel tied down by it. Life goes on, whether or not there are trou­bles.”</p>
    <p>A spokesman for the Registry Of Mar­riages told The Sun­day Times: “With the re­cently an­nounced re­vised safe man­age­ment mea­sures, cou­ples who want to solem­nise their mar­riage need not de­lay their plans.</p>
    <p>“They can still have in­ti­mate and mean­ing­ful wed­ding cel­e­bra­tions. What mat­ters is the cou­ple’s love and com­mit­ment for one an­other.”</p>
    <p>A cou­ple can have up to 48 peo­ple at­tend their solem­ni­sa­tion cer­e­mony, which can be held in venues such as places of wor­ship or ho­tels.</p>
    <p>If the cer­e­mony is held at home, at the Reg­istries of Civil and Mus­lim Mar­riages build­ing or des­ig­nated ar­eas at the Na­tional Mu­seum of Sin­ga­pore – where the venues tend to be smaller – then the limit is eight guests.</p>
    <p>Safe man­age­ment mea­sures in­clude hav­ing guests don face masks and check in via na­tional dig­i­tal check-in sys­tem SafeEn­try for cer­e­monies held at an ex­ter­nal venue.</p>
    <p>All at­ten­dees should also check their tem­per­a­ture and en­sure that they are feel­ing well be­fore turn­ing up.</p>
    <p>Self-ser­vice buf­fets at re­cep­tions are not al­lowed, and nei­ther are live per­for­mances or ac­tiv­i­ties that in­volve singing or shout­ing.</p>
    <p>Ms Zhuang and Mr Liu got mar­ried at her home, with only im­me­di­ate fam­ily mem­bers at­tend­ing.</p>
    <p>Ev­ery­one had sin­gle-por­tion plates of ayam penyet fol­low­ing the solem­ni­sa­tion, and plas­tic shields were pro­vided to sep­a­rate guests dur­ing meal­time.</p>
    <p>Mr Liu’s mother, who lives in Hong Kong and was un­able to travel to Sin­ga­pore due to bor­der con­trol mea­sures, joined 80 other guests via a live-stream link.</p>
    <p>Mr Liu said: “My mum can still ‘at­tend’, with the help of tech­nol­ogy. When the pan­demic sit­u­a­tion is more sta­ble and re­stric­tions are lifted, we’ll hold a big ban­quet din­ner so that ev­ery­one can come.”</p>
    <p>Soft­ware engi­neer Yuan Yiyang, 27, and ac­tu­ary Chris­tine Sun, 29, also tied the knot yesterday.</p>
    <p>They were the first cou­ple to be mar­ried at Gar­dens by the Bay’s Su­pertree Ob­ser­va­tory, which is now open for wed­ding solem­ni­sa­tions.</p>
    <p>The cou­ple had many dates at the gar­dens in the past and “felt great” to hold their spe­cial oc­ca­sion there, which was at­tended by 20 close friends.</p>
    <p>They picked the date so that their an­niver­sary din­ners will al­ways fall on the eve of a pub­lic hol­i­day.</p>
    <p>Ms Sh­eryl Lim, 26, and Mr Ben­jamin Yip, 30, also got mar­ried yesterday.</p>
    <p>Ms Lim said: “We’ll have a big din­ner when the sit­u­a­tion is bet­ter. For now, we will make the best out of things.”</p>
    <p>The pair picked the date be­cause they first started dat­ing in Au­gust 2012. They held a re­laxed sun­set cer­e­mony in a con­do­minium club­house by the pool, with 20 guests at­tend­ing.</p>
    <p>Ms Lim, who is a fi­nan­cial con­sul­tant, added with a chuckle: “In a way, this is also quite good – we can save on a lot of cost.”</p>
