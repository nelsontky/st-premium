    <p>Jurong Port is on track to hit its tar­get through­put of 26 mil­lion tons by 2025, de­spite de­lays caused by the Covid-19 pandemic, the op­er­a­tor said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Buf­fers are in place to cush­ion de­lays in the con­struc­tion of a $200 mil­lion fa­cil­ity – an im­por­tant fea­ture of the port’s growth plans – among other projects, busi­ness units pres­i­dent Saw Kok Wei said in a press state­ment.</p>
    <p>Work on the fa­cil­ity – a ready-mixed con­crete ecosys­tem, which will help the port save 18.5ha in land use and cut 600,000 truck trips a year – has been ham­pered by lock­downs ear­lier this year.</p>
    <p>It is ex­pected to be com­pleted by 2023.</p>
    <p>Mr Saw said: “We are still on track. There have been some de­lays to the project be­cause of Covid-19 but they are noth­ing that we can’t cope with, and they will not sub­stan­tially af­fect our abil­ity to achieve our tar­gets by 2025.”</p>
    <p>Con­tainer through­put at the Re­pub­lic’s sea port be­tween Jan­uary and June this year re­mained rel­a­tively ro­bust, dip­ping to 17.8 mil­lion twenty-foot equiv­a­lent units (TEUs) against 18 mil­lion TEUs from a year ago.</p>
    <p>CON­STRUC­TION SEC­TOR STALLED BY LOCK­DOWNS</p>
    <p>CIMB Pri­vate Bank­ing econ­o­mist Song Seng Wun said the con­struc­tion sec­tor is set to lead the coun­try’s eco­nomic re­cov­ery, but a lot de­pends on how quickly work­ers can get back to work, given the lock­downs in dor­mi­to­ries.</p>
    <p>De­mand for con­struc­tion ac­tiv­i­ties in Sin­ga­pore is slowly re­cov­er­ing as the Re­pub­lic takes baby steps to­wards re­open­ing the econ­omy, he added, not­ing that long-term de­mand in the sec­tor has re­mained strong amid the pandemic.</p>
    <p>He said: “You need all con­struc­tion work­ers to be back at work.”</p>
    <p>Busi­ness has been down for Jurong Port, which han­dles up to 90 per cent of all ce­ment and steel im­ported into Sin­ga­pore, though the op­er­a­tor is op­ti­mistic that num­bers will go back up by next quar­ter.</p>
    <p>Mr Saw said: “With con­struc­tion ef­fec­tively com­ing (to) a halt in the last few months, there has not been any ce­ment com­ing through the port be­cause the ce­ment si­los are full.</p>
    <p>“They are not go­ing out to the con­struc­tion site so we’ve ef­fec­tively had very lit­tle ce­ment be­ing dis­charged at Jurong Port since the cir­cuit breaker started.”</p>
    <p>“But we are not in dire straits. And we still have the fi­nan­cial re­sources to carry on with the projects,” he added.</p>
    <p>Chief strat­egy of­fi­cer Des­mond Lim, who was also at an on­line brief­ing, noted “very en­cour­ag­ing signs (in end-Au­gust, as) some of these ce­ment ves­sels have made plans to once again berth at the ports”.</p>
    <p>“We are in­creas­ingly... con­fi­dent that as ac­tiv­i­ties re­sume, al­beit grad­u­ally, we will start see­ing ce­ment vol­umes com­ing through. Hope­fully, in the next cou­ple of months, they will go back to the same lev­els as be­fore,” he added.</p>
