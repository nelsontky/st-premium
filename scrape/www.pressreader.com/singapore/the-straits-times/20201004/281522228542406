    <p>Din­ing out in­volves con­sid­er­able risks be­cause peo­ple are gath­ered in an en­closed space with­out their masks on and for a pro­longed du­ra­tion. While we un­der­stand that din­ers tend to con­tinue their con­ver­sa­tions and in­ter­ac­tions after their meals, mem­bers of the pub­lic should do so with their masks on to pre­vent the spread of droplets.</p>
    <p>’’ A SPOKESMAN, for the Min­istry of Sus­tain­abil­ity and the En­vi­ron­ment.</p>
    <p>Wear­ing a mask out­side the home has be­come part of ev­ery­day rou­tine over the past six months or so, but one grey area re­mains: When should it be re­moved – and put back on – when din­ing out?</p>
    <p>Get­ting it wrong can be costly: 32 din­ers were fined $300 each for flout­ing Covid-19 safe man­age­ment mea­sures at food and bev­er­age (F&B) out­lets, the au­thor­i­ties said last Tues­day – some for not putting on masks after eat­ing or drink­ing. The breaches were ob­served in eater­ies at Boat Quay, Bugis, Or­chard Road and Tan­jong Pa­gar.</p>
    <p>The Min­istry of Sus­tain­abil­ity and the En­vi­ron­ment (MSE) did not give a break­down on the num­ber of peo­ple fined for not wear­ing masks promptly after their meals, but a spokesman set out the rules.</p>
    <p>Masks must be worn at all times ex­cept when eat­ing or drink­ing or do­ing stren­u­ous ac­tiv­ity, re­gard­less of the premises. Con­ver­sa­tions in eater­ies after meals should be car­ried out with masks on.</p>
    <p>“Din­ing out in­volves con­sid­er­able risks be­cause peo­ple are gath­ered in an en­closed space with­out their masks on and for a pro­longed du­ra­tion,” said the MSE spokesman.</p>
    <p>“While we un­der­stand that din­ers tend to con­tinue their con­ver­sa­tions and in­ter­ac­tions after their meals, mem­bers of the pub­lic should do so with their masks on to pre­vent the spread of droplets.”</p>
    <p>The main driver of the spread of Covid-19 is through con­tact and res­pi­ra­tory droplets.</p>
    <p>“Din­ers who breach the safe man­age­ment mea­sures will face en­force­ment ac­tion, such as fines, with­out fur­ther warn­ing,” said the spokesman.</p>
    <p>A GREY AREA</p>
    <p>Most of the around 130 re­spon­dents who took part in an in­for­mal Sun­day Times poll on­line said they were aware of the mask­ing policy but ap­peared to take var­ied ap­proaches when din­ing out.</p>
    <p>The sur­vey noted that 43 per cent in­di­cated they re­move their mask just be­fore they started eat­ing or drink­ing, 26 per cent said they would do so only after a drink ar­rived, while 17 per cent said they would stay masked un­til food was served. Only 12 per cent said they would re­move their mask as soon as they sat down at a ta­ble.</p>
    <p>Post-meal be­hav­iour was equally var­ied, ac­cord­ing to the poll and ob­ser­va­tions at sev­eral hawker cen­tres and restau­rants.</p>
    <p>The sur­vey found that 43 per cent of re­spon­dents said they donned their masks im­me­di­ately after fin­ish­ing their food, even if their din­ing part­ners were still eat­ing, while 34 per cent said they put on their masks only if they were prepar­ing to leave the ta­ble, such as to go to the bath­room.</p>
    <p>But 16 per cent said they masked up only after ev­ery­one at the ta­ble had fin­ished eat­ing and drink­ing and 5 per cent said they put on their masks once the ta­ble was cleared.</p>
    <p>Over­all, re­spon­dents seemed sup­port­ive of the rules and un­der­stand why they are re­quired, with over 80 per cent say­ing it should be ac­cept­able to re­move masks only after food and drinks have ar­rived.</p>
    <p>“For ev­ery­one’s safety, we should con­tinue to mask up. Look at what hap­pened to Donald Trump,” noted one re­spon­dent, re­fer­ring to the United States Pres­i­dent’s re­cent Covid-19 di­ag­no­sis.</p>
    <p>Oth­ers also said mask­ing up could pro­tect not just the peo­ple at the ta­ble, but those around them as well – in­clud­ing din­ers eat­ing at the ta­ble nearby, or the wait staff.</p>
    <p>But some pointed out that be­ing fined $300 im­me­di­ately for not wear­ing a mask promptly enough can be harsh be­cause of the un­cer­tain­ties in­volved.</p>
    <p>Re­spon­dents were un­sure, for ex­am­ple, if there was a “grace pe­riod” to mask up after the last bite of food was con­sumed.</p>
    <p>They also noted that peo­ple at the same ta­ble would likely have al­ready been so­cial­is­ing over the course of the meal, and ques­tioned the ef­fec­tive­ness of mask­ing up im­me­di­ately.</p>
    <p>Din­ers The Sun­day Times spoke to at var­i­ous F&B places shared sim­i­lar sen­ti­ments.</p>
    <p>At Wham­poa Makan Place, nurse Thilagavat­hy Ulaganatha­n, 27, sug­gested that the au­thor­i­ties con­sider set­ting a grace pe­riod of be­tween five and 10 min­utes for pa­trons to put on masks after a meal or drink.</p>
    <p>“Who­ever comes with me (for meals) is prob­a­bly my fam­ily or my col­leagues; they’re not go­ing to be strangers. I don’t think it’s a big is­sue if they put down their masks and chit chat for a bit,” she said.</p>
    <p>“It’s not very much dif­fer­ent from when they take out their mask to eat and chit chat at the same time. The con­tact is not that dif­fer­ent.”</p>
    <p>Mr Al M. Isa, a 58-year-old re­tired re­gional di­rec­tor, said that while peo­ple should mask up after their meals, some may choose to grab a drink after eat­ing.</p>
    <p>“Should peo­ple mask up and down ev­ery time they take a sip? It is a grey area. Am­bas­sadors should also show some dis­cre­tion and as­sess the sit­u­a­tion on a case-by­case ba­sis,” said Mr Al, who was din­ing at Changi Vil­lage Hawker Cen­tre. But over­all, the mask policy is good, he said, “be­cause you never know who may not be well”.</p>
    <p>QUES­TION­ABLE EF­FEC­TIVE­NESS</p>
    <p>Who­ever comes with me (for meals) is prob­a­bly my fam­ily or my col­leagues... I don’t think it’s a big is­sue if they put down their masks and chit chat for a bit. It’s not very much dif­fer­ent from when they take out their mask to eat and chit chat at the same time.</p>
    <p>’’ NURSE THILAGAVAT­HY ULAGANATHA­N, who sug­gests that the au­thor­i­ties con­sider set­ting a grace pe­riod of be­tween five and 10 min­utes for pa­trons to put on masks after a meal or drink.</p>
    <p>DIF­FER­ENT POLI­CIES</p>
    <p>Own­ers of F&B out­lets said they do their best to en­force the mask­ing policy, but pointed to var­i­ous chal­lenges along the way.</p>
    <p>Mr Wong Jie Wen said most of the cus­tomers at his “zi char” stall in Thom­son Road are law-abid­ing and re­move their masks only when their meal or drink ar­rives.</p>
    <p>He added that he had not en­coun­tered any clients who re­fused to don masks even after their ta­ble has been cleared.</p>
    <p>But “not ev­ery cus­tomer is al­ways so obe­di­ent”, he said, adding that there are some who stay longer at the cof­fee shop after fin­ish­ing their meal, but they will typ­i­cally have a bit of al­co­hol or drink in their cups to jus­tify their mask­free states.</p>
    <p>Praelum Wine Bistro co-owner Ger­ald Lu said his staff re­mind guests that they should have masks on un­til a bev­er­age is served.</p>
    <p>“But we have dif­fi­cul­ties in en­forc­ing the mask rule, as it pisses some peo­ple off, and we have had peo­ple who tell us that they will take their busi­ness else­where if we don’t let them flout the rules,” said Mr Lu.</p>
    <p>Cus­tomers at the Dux­ton Hill out­let find ways to break the rules, which can put the busi­ness in a dif­fi­cult po­si­tion, he said.</p>
    <p>Mr Lu noted how he had a group of 10 flout the five-diner rule by mak­ing two sep­a­rate reser­va­tions and re­quest­ing ta­bles “near­est the door”.</p>
    <p>“This cre­ates a lot of ten­sion. It puts the es­tab­lish­ment, which only wants to sur­vive, in a dif­fi­cult po­si­tion,” he added.</p>
    <p>Should peo­ple mask up and down ev­ery time they take a sip? It is a grey area. Am­bas­sadors should also show some dis­cre­tion and as­sess the sit­u­a­tion on a case-by-case ba­sis.</p>
