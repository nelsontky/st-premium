    <p>Sin­ga­pore will get through the cur­rent Covid-19 cri­sis and emerge more united from the shared or­deal, Prime Min­is­ter Lee Hsien Loong said yes­ter­day. Send­ing out a mes­sage of unity and re­silience to mark Sin­ga­pore’s 55th Na­tional</p>
    <p>Day cel­e­bra­tions, he pointed out that fac­ing this chal­lenge to­gether could de­fine this gen­er­a­tion of Sin­ga­pore­ans.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore will get through the cur­rent Covid-19 cri­sis – just as it has weath­ered storms be­fore – and emerge more united from the shared or­deal, Prime Min­is­ter Lee Hsien Loong said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Send­ing out a mes­sage of unity and re­silience to mark Sin­ga­pore’s 55th Na­tional Day cel­e­bra­tions, PM Lee pointed out that fac­ing this chal­lenge to­gether could de­fine this gen­er­a­tion of Sin­ga­pore­ans for the fu­ture.</p>
    <p>“The shared or­deal will toughen a whole pop­u­la­tion, and bond us to­gether as one united peo­ple just like how the Pioneer and Merdeka gen­er­a­tions were tem­pered by Sep­a­ra­tion and In­de­pen­dence, and eco­nomic crises in our early years as a na­tion,” he said in a tele­vised broad­cast.</p>
    <p>While this year’s cel­e­bra­tions, in the midst of the pan­demic, were rel­a­tively sub­dued, PM Lee said they of­fered an op­por­tu­nity to pay trib­ute to those on the front lines fight­ing Covid-19.</p>
    <p>He re­counted how many Sin­ga­pore­ans, such as doc­tors and nurses who vol­un­teered their ser­vices and oth­ers who dis­trib­uted meals to those in need, had gone be­yond the call of duty in tack­ling the pan­demic. Their acts had made all the dif­fer­ence to the na­tion’s re­sponse to Covid-19.</p>
    <p>This unity and re­silience will be needed more than ever as Sin­ga­pore braces it­self for a se­vere eco­nomic down­turn, he said.</p>
    <p>“In good years, our pa­rades re­joice in our progress, and look for­ward to a bet­ter fu­ture to­gether,” he said. “In dif­fi­cult years, we still hold Na­tional Day Pa­rades, to re­new our re­solve to weather the storm and take Sin­ga­pore through to bet­ter days.”</p>
    <p>There were no mass cel­e­bra­tions yes­ter­day. A scaled-down pa­rade in the morn­ing at the Padang fea­tured only about 200 par­tic­i­pants, while the in­door evening show had 87 per­form­ers.</p>
    <p>The pa­rade had just four masked con­tin­gents oc­cu­py­ing less than one-third of the Padang, with 150 spec­ta­tors – a far cry from last year’s 27,000-strong au­di­ence.</p>
    <p>Reviewed by Pres­i­dent Hal­imah</p>
    <p>Ya­cob, it fea­tured a spe­cial salute by the Sin­ga­pore Armed Forces and Sin­ga­pore Po­lice Force to front-line work­ers, as well as a flag-rais­ing cer­e­mony.</p>
    <p>The “An­them Mo­ment” was syn­chro­nised with that at seven other lo­ca­tions around Sin­ga­pore rep­re­sent­ing key na­tional sec­tors – from Changi Air­port, which has brought in es­sen­tial sup­plies dur­ing the pan­demic, to the Na­tional Cen­tre for In­fec­tious Dis­eases, which is “ground zero” in Sin­ga­pore’s Covid-19 bat­tle.</p>
    <p>Hos­pi­tal­ity man­ager Maslin­dah Fadzi­lah, 40, was among the in­vited guests at one of the cer­e­monies. She has helped to man­age a Covid-19 quar­an­tine fa­cil­ity since April.</p>
    <p>“Even though this year’s cel­e­bra­tion is on a smaller scale, it was a very mem­o­rable Na­tional Day,” she said.</p>
    <p>The theme of ex­press­ing grat­i­tude to those on the front lines was also seen in how tra­di­tional com­po­nents of the pa­rade were brought to the heart­land, such as the Red Lions parachutis­ts and F-15SG “Roar of Unity” aerial dis­play.</p>
    <p>The mobile col­umn rolled into heart­land ar­eas for a sec­ond con­sec­u­tive year as the pa­rade or­gan­is­ers sought to bring the show closer to Sin­ga­pore­ans.</p>
    <p>Work­ers’ Party chief and Leader of the Op­po­si­tion Pri­tam Singh said that while the pa­rade was much more muted, the sim­plic­ity was sig­nif­i­cant and mean­ing­ful in its own way.</p>
    <p>“No mat­ter what cri­sis hits us, Sin­ga­pore will al­ways be our home. We must al­ways seek strength and com­fort from our fel­low Sin­ga­pore­ans. Our unity and com­mit­ment to each other is ul­ti­mately not rooted in the things money can buy,” he said on Face­book yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>At the Star Vista the­atre in the evening, per­form­ers gave their in­ter­pre­ta­tions of old Na­tional Day songs as well as new of­fer­ings, de­signed spe­cially for view­ing on TV.</p>
    <p>Singer Nathan Hartono gave a stir­ring ren­di­tion of this year’s theme song, Ev­ery­thing I Am. Later, the per­form­ers were joined vir­tu­ally by sev­eral thou­sand Sin­ga­pore­ans who had sent in videos of them­selves singing the ev­er­green We Are Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>The ac­com­pa­ny­ing film told the story of how a wide spec­trum of Sin­ga­pore­ans – health­care work­ers, de­liv­ery rid­ers, se­cu­rity of­fi­cers, com­mu­nity vol­un­teers and other es­sen­tial work­ers – have been keep­ing Sin­ga­pore go­ing in the past few months.</p>
    <p>Among those fea­tured was Mr Nizar Mo­hamed Shar­iff, 49, founder of Free Food For All, whose char­ity has been de­liv­er­ing meals to nearly 1,000 house­holds each month through­out the Covid-19 pe­riod.</p>
    <p>Fire­works lit up the sky at 10 lo­ca­tions around the is­land to cap a Na­tional Day Pa­rade that will be re­mem­bered not just for its for­mat but also for its theme of sol­i­dar­ity in the face of chal­lenges.</p>
