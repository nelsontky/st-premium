    <p>Top de­fence of­fi­cials from 18 coun­tries have pledged to con­tinue en­hanc­ing strate­gic di­a­logue and pro­mot­ing prac­ti­cal co­op­er­a­tion on re­gional de­fence and se­cu­rity is­sues.</p>
    <p>In a joint dec­la­ra­tion is­sued yes­ter­day, they also made a com­mit­ment to up­hold their an­nual meet­ing as the de facto mul­ti­lat­eral mech­a­nism for de­fence co­op­er­a­tion in an Asean-cen­tred re­gional ar­chi­tec­ture.</p>
    <p>The meet­ing of the 7th Asean De­fence Min­is­ters’ Meet­ing-Plus (ADMM-Plus) in­volves the 10 Asean mem­bers and eight di­a­logue part­ners: Aus­tralia, China, In­dia, Ja­pan, New Zealand, South Korea, Rus­sia and the United States.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day’s meet­ing marked 10 years since the ADMM-Plus was es­tab­lished in 2010.</p>
    <p>In this pe­riod, the ADMM-Plus has suc­cess­fully fa­cil­i­tated open and con­struc­tive di­a­logue on re­gional se­cu­rity is­sues, Sin­ga­pore’s Min­istry of De­fence (Min­def) said in a state­ment yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>It has also de­vel­oped prac­ti­cal co­op­er­a­tion in do­mains such as mar­itime se­cu­rity, counter-ter­ror­ism, and hu­man­i­tar­ian help and disas­ter re­lief, the min­istry added.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing the meet­ing, held via video con­fer­ence, the de­fence lead­ers agreed that deeper col­lab­o­ra­tion was im­por­tant in ad­dress­ing the com­plex chal­lenges of the se­cu­rity land­scape.</p>
    <p>They also ex­changed views on the re­gional and in­ter­na­tional se­cu­rity en­vi­ron­ment, Min­def said.</p>
    <p>The lead­ers at the meet­ing in­cluded China’s De­fence Min­is­ter Wei Fenghe, US Act­ing De­fence Sec­re­tary Christo­pher Miller, In­dia’s De­fence Min­is­ter Rajnath</p>
    <p>Singh and Asean de­fence chiefs.</p>
    <p>Speak­ing at the end of the ADMM-Plus and the ADMM held a day ear­lier, Sin­ga­pore’s De­fence Min­is­ter Ng Eng Hen said the two joint dec­la­ra­tions from the meet­ings showed the coun­tries’ com­mit­ment to ad­dress cur­rent prob­lems and the re­solve to work to­gether for the fu­ture.</p>
    <p>“It was sig­nif­i­cant that both joint dec­la­ra­tions talked about the ba­sis for deal­ing with the present chal­lenges as well as our fu­ture. And that would be con­sis­tency with the rule of law, peace­ful set­tle­ment of dis­putes and, in par­tic­u­lar, for the South China Sea,” Dr Ng said, ac­cord­ing to an interview tran­script re­leased by Min­def.</p>
    <p>The ADMM-Plus was in­au­gu­rated on Oct 12, 2010, in Viet­nam and started as a tri­en­nial af­fair be­fore be­com­ing bi­en­nial. Since 2017, it has been held an­nu­ally.</p>
    <p>Dr Ng said the ADMM-Plus started as a leap of faith. The ini­tial plan to meet the eight non-Asean coun­tries every three years “was the ex­tent of our faith”.</p>
    <p>He added: “Over the years, it has moved down to every two years and now an­nu­ally. This is a re­quest from the Plus part­ners, so it shows that it is im­por­tant.”</p>
    <p>The Asean-Ja­pan De­fence Min­is­ters’ In­for­mal Meet­ing was also held vir­tu­ally yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Asean de­fence chiefs also wel­comed Ja­pan’s newly ap­pointed De­fence Min­is­ter Nobuo Kishi to the ADMM-Plus.</p>
    <p>They ex­pressed their ap­pre­ci­a­tion for Ja­pan’s con­tin­ued en­gage­ment of the re­gion and com­mit­ment to the 18-mem­ber meet­ing, said Min­def.</p>
