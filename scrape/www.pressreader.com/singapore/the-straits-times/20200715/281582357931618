    <p>The dengue out­break con­tin­ues to surge, with 1,678 peo­ple di­ag­nosed with the vi­ral in­fec­tion last week, a 16 per cent in­crease over the pre­vi­ous week’s fig­ure of 1,449. It was the fifth week run­ning with more than 1,000 cases. Such high in­fec­tion num­bers have not been seen here be­fore. A to­tal of 17,249 peo­ple here had been in­fected as of 3pm on Mon­day.</p>
    <p>The surge in dengue cases con­tin­ues, with 1,678 peo­ple di­ag­nosed with the vi­ral in­fec­tion last week, a 16 per cent in­crease over the pre­vi­ous week’s fig­ure of 1,449.</p>
    <p>It was the fifth week run­ning with more than 1,000 cases.</p>
    <p>Such high in­fec­tion num­bers have not been seen here be­fore.</p>
    <p>The big­gest num­ber of peo­ple in­fected in a week prior to this year was 891, in 2014.</p>
    <p>A to­tal of 17,249 peo­ple here have been in­fected so far this year, as of 3pm on Mon­day.</p>
    <p>This al­ready ex­ceeds the an­nual in­fec­tion num­bers for all pre­vi­ous years ex­cept for the epi­demic of 2013-2014.</p>
    <p>Ex­perts warn that the num­ber this year is likely to sur­pass even the 22,170 in­fec­tions of 2013.</p>
    <p>At least 16 peo­ple have died from dengue this year.</p>
    <p>The high­est num­ber of fa­tal­i­ties was in 2005, when 25 peo­ple died.</p>
    <p>There are more than 370 ac­tive clus­ters, mostly in the east, with 133 con­sid­ered high-risk, while 17 each have more than 100 peo­ple in­fected.</p>
    <p>There are three clus­ters where more than 200 peo­ple liv­ing or work­ing within 150m of one an­other have been in­fected within a two-week pe­riod.</p>
    <p>The big­gest clus­ter is in the Bukit Panjang-Woodlands area, with 242 in­fec­tions, of which 42 oc­curred within the past fort­night.</p>
    <p>Block 608 in Senja Road, which is part of the clus­ter, has 33 peo­ple with dengue.</p>
    <p>Pro­fes­sor Duane Gubler, a dengue ex­pert at Duke-NUS Med­i­cal School, said: “There are a num­ber of fac­tors that in­flu­ence trans­mis­sion dy­nam­ics and epi­demics.”</p>
    <p>A surge could be caused by a change in the virus serotype.</p>
    <p>There are f our dengue vi­ral strains and get­ting in­fected by one does not pro­tect a per­son from get­ting the other three.</p>
    <p>In the early part of this year, the less fre­quently seen DenV-3 strain ap­peared to be gain­ing as­cen­dancy and was be­lieved to have caused the rise in in­fec­tions, as few peo­ple here are im­mune to it.</p>
    <p>But it now seems to have given way to DenV-2, which is of­ten the dom­i­nant strain here.</p>
    <p>The Na­tional En­vi­ron­ment Agency sug­gested some weeks ago that the un­usual in­crease in cases could be due to the cir­cuit breaker mea­sures i mple­mented to fight Covid-19.</p>
    <p>The Aedes mosquito that spreads dengue is a day biter, so more peo­ple stay­ing home could have led to in­creased num­bers of in­fec­tions.</p>
    <p>The l ock­down mea­sures were lifted some time back, but the surge in cases con­tin­ues unabated.</p>
    <p>Prof Gubler spec­u­lated that “if virus serotype and herd im­mu­nity, mosquito pop­u­la­tion den­si­ties and hu­man be­hav­iour have been ruled out, I would guess that it is the strain of virus”.</p>
    <p>“It has been demon­strated on sev­eral oc­ca­sions that small mu­ta­tions in the virus com­bined with pos­i­tive se­lec­tion can lead to the emer­gence of strains of virus of any serotype that have greater epi­demic po­ten­tial.”</p>
    <p>Dengue in­fec­tions are ex­pected to stay high for some months, with the hot and wet weather mak­ing it eas­ier for the mos­qui­toes to breed.</p>
    <p>Symp­toms of dengue in­clude a sud­den on­set of fever that lasts be­tween two and seven days, se­vere headache and pain be­hind the eyes, nau­sea and vom­it­ing, and joint and mus­cle ache.</p>
    <p>Some peo­ple might get a skin rash that looks like red pin­pricks, as well as bleed­ing from the nose and gums.</p>
    <p>There is no spe­cific treat­ment for dengue, but doc­tors can pro­vide sup­port and ease pain.</p>
    <p>Most peo­ple can be treated at out­pa­tient clin­ics.</p>
    <p>About one in five dengue pa­tients be­comes so sick that hos­pi­tal care is needed.</p>
    <p>From to­day, as part of en­hanced mea­sures to con­tain dengue in­fec­tion, heav­ier penal­ties will be im­posed on house­holds, con­struc­tion sites and town coun­cils found to be breed­ing mos­qui­toes.</p>
