    <p>STAR SUR­VIVES COVID-19: Bryan Cranston (left), 64, star of TV se­ries Break­ing Bad (2008-2013), says he has re­cov­ered from Covid-19 and shared a video of him­self do­nat­ing plasma at a Los An­ge­les blood bank.</p>
    <p>The five-time Emmy win­ner and two-time Tony Award win­ner wrote in an In­sta­gram post last Thurs­day that he was lucky his symp­toms were very mild. The ac­tor, who is best known for his role in Break­ing Bad as a chem­istry teacher who re­sorts to mak­ing and sell­ing crys­tal meth to pay for his can­cer treat­ment, said he had been vig­i­lant: “I was pretty strict in ad­her­ing to the pro­to­cols and still... I con­tracted the virus.”</p>
    <p>He said he un­der­stood the frus­tra­tion of peo­ple hav­ing to prac­tise so­cial dis­tanc­ing. But he warned his fol­low­ers not to be­come com­pla­cent.</p>
    <p>“I count my bless­ings and urge you to keep wear­ing the d*** mask, keep wash­ing your hands and stay so­cially dis­tant,” he added. “We can pre­vail – but ONLY if we fol­low the rules to­gether.”</p>
