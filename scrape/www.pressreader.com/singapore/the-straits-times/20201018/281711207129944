    <p>As the global pan­demic rages on, more lo­cals have been head­ing to Sin­ga­pore’s South­ern Is­lands for their dose of sun, sea and sand.</p>
    <p>Some spots have proven par­tic­u­larly pop­u­lar – since beaches re­opened in June, the av­er­age monthly vis­i­tor­ship to St John’s, Lazarus and Seringat is­lands, which are linked to one an­other, has been up by 60 per cent com­pared with last year.</p>
    <p>A spokesman for the Sin­ga­pore Land Au­thor­ity (SLA), which man­ages these is­lands, said: “We have ob­served an in­crease in vis­i­tors to St John’s, Lazarus and Seringat is­lands since the re­open­ing of beaches on June 19, with the num­ber of vis­i­tors av­er­ag­ing about 10,800 per month.</p>
    <p>“This is sig­nif­i­cantly higher than the av­er­age monthly vis­i­tor count of about 6,800 in 2019,” the spokesman added, not­ing that SLA has sent of­fi­cers down to re­mind peo­ple to ob­serve safe dis­tanc­ing.</p>
    <p>Ferry op­er­a­tors and yacht rental firms said that since the cir­cuit breaker mea­sures were eased, there has been strong de­mand from peo­ple look­ing for a quick get­away.</p>
    <p>“We fore­see that as long as the bor­ders are closed, the (higher) de­mand will be there,” said Mr Li Guoli, man­ager at Sin­ga­pore Is­land Cruise and Ferry Ser­vices, which plies the route be­tween Sin­ga­pore’s main­land and the South­ern Is­lands. He said rid­er­ship is up by as much as 40 per cent com­pared with pre-pan­demic lev­els.</p>
    <p>In Au­gust, the ferry op­er­a­tor – which typ­i­cally takes peo­ple to St John’s and Kusu is­lands – added a di­rect week­day ser­vice to St John’s Is­land af­ter it re­alised that it was a pop­u­lar stop for guests head­ing to the beach on Lazarus Is­land.</p>
    <p>Ma­rina South Fer­ries, which picks up pas­sen­gers from the main­land and stops at St John’s, Kusu and Big Sis­ters’ is­lands, has mean­while seen rid­er­ship go up by about 50 per cent com­pared with lev­els be­fore the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>“Pre­vi­ously, our cus­tomers com­prised mostly mi­grant work­ers and ex­pats,” said man­ag­ing direc­tor Eric Wong. “Now we see a lot more Sin­ga­pore­ans re­dis­cov­er­ing Sin­ga­pore and walk­ing the road less trav­elled – most of them are first­timers to the South­ern Is­lands.”</p>
    <p>He said the com­pany has added more fer­ries to meet the de­mand – dur­ing peak pe­ri­ods, it has a boat leav­ing ev­ery 15 min­utes – and has also in­creased the fre­quency of depar­tures on week­days.</p>
    <p>The an­nual Kusu Is­land pil­grim­age sea­son, which be­gan yes­ter­day and runs till Nov 14, will see more devo­tees flock to the is­land. Devo­tees have to book a seat via SLA’s on­line por­tal – the reg­u­lar pub­lic ferry routes will not stop at Kusu Is­land. No more than 500 vis­i­tors will be al­lowed to travel to the is­land each day, and fer­ries head­ing there will have up to 50 pas­sen­gers per hourly de­par­ture.</p>
    <p>“As week­ends are a pop­u­lar pe­riod dur­ing Kusu pil­grim­age sea­son, vis­i­tors are ad­vised to visit Kusu Is­land on week­days,” SLA’s spokesman added.</p>
    <p>Most yacht char­ter firms The Sun­day Times spoke to have seen more in­ter­est from peo­ple look­ing to ex­plore the is­lands. At Xim­ula Sail, in­quiries have gone up by about 30 per cent. It of­fers, among other things, a four-hour yacht trip around the South­ern Is­lands, drop­ping an­chor at Lazarus Is­land.</p>
    <p>“Be­fore Covid, we would see a hand­ful of fam­i­lies (at Lazarus) – it was al­most like a pri­vate beach,” said mar­ket­ing as­sis­tant and crew mem­ber Vanessa Lim. “Now it feels like Sen­tosa or East Coast Park.”</p>
