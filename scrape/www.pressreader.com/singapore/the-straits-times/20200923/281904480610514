    <p>•</p>
    <p>World lead­ers came to­gether, vir­tu­ally, to mark the 75th an­niver­sary of the United Na­tions, as the deadly coro­n­avirus pan­demic and ten­sions be­tween the United States and China chal­lenge the ef­fec­tive­ness and sol­i­dar­ity of the 193-mem­ber body.</p>
    <p>As Covid-19 be­gan to spread world­wide ear­lier this year, forc­ing mil­lions of peo­ple to shel­ter at home and dev­as­tat­ing economies, coun­tries turned in­ward and diplo­mats say the UN strug­gled to as­sert it­self. Also, long-sim­mer­ing ten­sions be­tween the US and China hit boil­ing point over the pan­demic, spot­light­ing Bei­jing’s bid for greater mul­ti­lat­eral in­flu­ence in a chal­lenge to Wash­ing­ton’s tra­di­tional lead­er­ship.</p>
    <p>The coro­n­avirus emerged in China late last year, and Wash­ing­ton has ac­cused Bei­jing of a lack of trans­parency that it says wors­ened the out­break. China de­nies this.</p>
    <p>In an ap­par­ent swipe at the US, China’s Pres­i­dent, Xi Jin­ping said on Mon­day: “No coun­try has the right to dom­i­nate global af­fairs, con­trol the des­tiny of oth­ers, or keep ad­van­tages in devel­op­ment all to it­self. Even less should one be al­lowed to do what­ever it likes and be the hege­mon, bully or boss of the world. Uni­lat­er­al­ism is a dead end.”</p>
    <p>China has por­trayed it­self as the chief cheer­leader for mul­ti­lat­er­al­ism as Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump’s dis­re­gard for in­ter­na­tional co­op­er­a­tion led to Wash­ing­ton’s quit­ting global deals on cli­mate and Iran as well as leav­ing the UN Hu­man Rights Coun­cil and the World Health Or­gan­i­sa­tion (WHO).</p>
    <p>Deputy US am­bas­sador to the UN Cherith Nor­man Chalet told the Gen­eral Assem­bly the world body had in many ways proven to be a suc­cess­ful ex­per­i­ment, but “there are also rea­sons for con­cern”.</p>
    <p>“The United Na­tions has for too long been re­sis­tant to mean­ing­ful re­form, too of­ten lack­ing in trans­parency, and too vul­ner­a­ble to the agenda of au­to­cratic regimes and dic­ta­tor­ships,” she said.</p>
    <p>The US with­drawal from the</p>
    <p>WHO came af­ter Mr Trump ac­cused the agency of be­ing a pup­pet of China, a claim the WHO de­nied.</p>
    <p>Rus­sian For­eign Min­is­ter Sergei Lavrov said “in­creas­ing dis­cord” in the in­ter­na­tional com­mu­nity was sparked by some coun­tries med­dling in the do­mes­tic af­fairs of other states and im­pos­ing uni­lat­eral sanc­tions – a veiled dig at Wash­ing­ton.“The world is tired of di­vid­ing lines, di­vid­ing states into them and us. The world re­quires in­creas­ing mul­ti­lat­eral as­sis­tance and co­op­er­a­tion,” he said.</p>
    <p>The pan­demic has ex­posed the world’s fragili­ties, UN Sec­re­taryGen­eral An­to­nio Guter­res said, adding: “To­day we have a sur­plus of mul­ti­lat­eral chal­lenges and a deficit of mul­ti­lat­eral so­lu­tions.”</p>
    <p>The Se­cu­rity Coun­cil took months to back a call by Mr Guter­res for a global cease­fire – to al­low coun­tries to fo­cus on fight­ing Covid-19 – due to bick­er­ing be­tween China and the US.</p>
    <p>Ger­man Chan­cel­lor An­gela Merkel told the Gen­eral Assem­bly the in­ter­ests of in­di­vid­ual mem­ber states had “too of­ten” forced the UN to lag be­hind its ideals.</p>
    <p>“Those who be­lieve that they can get along bet­ter alone are mis­taken. Our well-be­ing is some­thing that we share – our suf­fer­ing too. We are one world,” she said.</p>
    <p>Sev­eral lead­ers called for UN re­form, in par­tic­u­lar the 15-mem­ber Se­cu­rity Coun­cil, ar­gu­ing it was un­fair that the US, Rus­sia, China, France and Bri­tain were the only per­ma­nent veto-wield­ing pow­ers.</p>
    <p>Mon­day’s one-day spe­cial event came ahead of the an­nual meet­ing of world lead­ers, which started yes­ter­day with no pres­i­dents or prime min­is­ters phys­i­cally present in New York. All state­ments were pre­re­corded and will be broad­cast in the Gen­eral Assem­bly hall.</p>
    <p>The UN was cre­ated af­ter World War II to pre­vent an­other such con­flict. While there has not been a World War III, lead­ers adopted a state­ment on Mon­day ac­knowl­edg­ing “mo­ments of dis­ap­point­ment”.</p>
    <p>“All this calls for greater ac­tion, not less,” the state­ment said.</p>
