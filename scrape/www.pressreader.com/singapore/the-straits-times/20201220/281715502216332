    <p>Tun Ha­jah Ra­hah was a source of strength, courage and in­spi­ra­tion for her fam­ily and for all Malaysians. She stood res­o­lutely be­side her hus­band, Tun Razak, when he led Malaysia at a crit­i­cal pe­riod in its his­tory. She will be re­mem­bered for her de­vo­tion to coun­try and fam­ily.</p>
    <p>PRIME MIN­IS­TER LEE HSIEN LOONG</p>
    <p>PE­TAL­ING JAYA • Tun Ra­hah Mohd Noah, widow of Malaysia’s sec­ond prime min­is­ter Ab­dul Razak Hus­sein, was ac­corded a state fu­neral and buried at the Na­tional He­roes Mau­soleum within the grounds of the Na­tional Mosque in Kuala Lumpur yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Tun Ra­hah, who was also the mother of for­mer prime min­is­ter Na­jib Razak, died on Fri­day, aged 87. Trib­utes poured in from across the coun­try and abroad.</p>
    <p>Malaysia’s King Sul­tan Ab­dul­lah Ah­mad Shah and Queen Az­izah Ami­nah Maimu­nah Iskan­dariah were among those who ex­pressed their con­do­lences.</p>
    <p>“Their Majesties both ex­pressed their hope that the en­tire fam­ily of the late Tun Ra­hah be pa­tient and re­main stead­fast in this sea­son of sad­ness. Their Majesties pray that the soul of Al­lah­yarhamah (the de­ceased) be blessed by Al­lah and be placed among the right­eous,” said the palace’s Face­book page.</p>
    <p>Prime Min­is­ter Muhyid­din Yassin also ex­tended his con­do­lences to Na­jib and his fam­ily. “The gov­ern­ment has de­cided to give Al­lah­yarhamah a state fu­neral and burial,” he said.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore Prime Min­is­ter Lee Hsien Loong said he was deeply sad­dened to hear of Tun Ra­hah’s pass­ing. “Tun Ha­jah Ra­hah was a source of strength, courage and in­spi­ra­tion for her fam­ily and for all Malaysians,” said PM Lee in a Face­book post yes­ter­day. “She stood res­o­lutely be­side her hus­band, Tun Razak, when he led Malaysia at a crit­i­cal pe­riod in its his­tory. She will be re­mem­bered for her de­vo­tion to coun­try and fam­ily. Our thoughts are with her fam­ily and the peo­ple of Malaysia dur­ing this time of mourn­ing.”</p>
    <p>For­mer prime min­is­ter Ma­hathir Mo­hamad said Madam Ra­hah had made enor­mous con­tri­bu­tions to as­sist Tun Razak when he was the sec­ond prime min­is­ter. Tun Dr Ma­hathir de­scribed her as among the last from the in­de­pen­dence gen­er­a­tion who con­trib­uted in­valu­able ser­vices and sac­ri­fices to the coun­try.</p>
    <p>“(She) is the Merdeka gen­er­a­tion... Not many peo­ple of the Merdeka gen­er­a­tion are still alive.</p>
    <p>Maybe (she) was among the last. She helped Tun Razak when he was the prime min­is­ter,” he said.</p>
    <p>Op­po­si­tion leader and Parti Kead­i­lan Rakyat pres­i­dent An­war Ibrahim also of­fered a mes­sage of sym­pa­thy. “Con­do­lences to Na­jib and his fam­ily. I am sad­dened and pray that her soul be blessed,” he tweeted.</p>
    <p>In a tweet, Na­jib ex­pressed sad­ness over his mother’s death at the Prince Court Med­i­cal Cen­tre in Kuala Lumpur on Fri­day.</p>
    <p>“Bonda (mother) is no longer. The sad­ness and tears are flow­ing. There are no words to de­scribe this loss. Mum was akin to a guid­ing</p>
    <p>light in my life. My world now seems like it is in dark­ness. No more shin­ing light,” he said in a Face­book post.</p>
    <p>The for­mer pre­mier, who has been sen­tenced to 12 years in jail over the multi­bil­lion-dol­lar 1Malaysia De­vel­op­ment Ber­had (1MDB) cor­rup­tion case and re­mains free pend­ing his ap­peal, is the el­dest of Tun Razak’s five sons.</p>
    <p>Born in Muar, Jo­hor, in 1933, Madam Ra­hah was the daugh­ter of the late Mo­ham­mad Noah Omar, one of the founders of Umno who went on to be­come the first Speaker of Par­lia­ment’s Lower House.</p>
