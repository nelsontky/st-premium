    <p>Com­ple­ment your work-from-home sit­u­a­tion with a stylish work­out from home – in these lo­cal activewear la­bels.</p>
    <p>F BRAND</p>
    <p>Pick up straight­for­ward, clean-cut activewear ba­sics from co-ed sports­wear la­bel F Brand, launched last month.</p>
    <p>For the women’s line, find bra tops ($29.80), shorts ($39.80 to $41.80) and the top-sell­ing Bare Some Skin Pants ($45.80) that come with pock­ets.</p>
    <p>The men’s line com­prises tees ($28.80), shorts ($34.80) and run­ner pants ($58.80). Sizes are avail­able in XS to XXL.</p>
    <p>Avail­able at: fbrand.com.sg</p>
    <p>GLOWCO</p>
    <p>The idea for mod­est activewear mar­ket­place GlowCo came about in 2018 af­ter fit­ness in­struc­tor Nawal Al­had­dad, 30, no­ticed many of her Mus­lim clients strug­gling to work out com­fort­ably.</p>
    <p>“Their tra­di­tional hi­jabs wouldn’t stay on and their out­fits would ride up, leav­ing them drenched in sweat and feel­ing hot and un­com­fort­able,” she says. Most would wear cot­ton T-shirts or activewear from in­ter­na­tional brands, and have to don an added layer on top be­fore leav­ing the house or stu­dio.</p>
    <p>She wanted to “cut that step” and em­power her clients to leave home con­fi­dently in activewear. She launched GlowCo early last year with just four brands, in­clud­ing an in-house la­bel, GlowCo Ex­clu­sive.</p>
    <p>The GlowCo Ex­clu­sive line is de­signed in Sin­ga­pore and man­u­fac­tured in Thai­land.</p>
    <p>Pieces range from $14.90 for a jersey shawl to $79 for mod­est swim tops, with best­sellers be­ing the Af­ter­glow sports top ($49) and printed tights ($49 to $54.90). The line will de­but sports hi­jabs ($39) next month.</p>
    <p>Ms Nawal adds: “We pride our sports­wear line on be­ing func­tional, sweat-wick­ing, stylish and mod­est.”</p>
    <p>Avail­able at: 09-46 T-Space, 1 Tampines North Drive 1, and glowco.shop</p>

    <p>NINJA BY YEOMAMA</p>
    <p>Fancy batik on your work­out gear? This batik activewear line was started sim­ply be­cause co-founder Desleen Yeo wanted to be clothed in batik at all times.</p>

    <p>RE­VIVE&CO</p>
    <p>Launched in May, co-ed ath­leisure la­bel Re­vive&Co was born af­ter founders Nat­vianne De­va­jothi and Glo­ria Oh, both 27, were in­spired by the role ex­er­cise played dur­ing their times of hard­ship. Want­ing to reach out with fit­ness to oth­ers fac­ing dif­fi­cul­ties, they launched Re­vive&Co, invit­ing cus­tomers to share – on the brand’s so­cial me­dia – their strug­gles with men­tal and phys­i­cal well­ness, and how they over­came them through ex­er­cise.</p>
