    <p>WASH­ING­TON • Af­ter weeks of wait­ing, Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump’s ad­min­is­tra­tion cleared the way for Pres­i­dent-elect Joe Bi­den to tran­si­tion to the White House, giv­ing him ac­cess to brief­ings and fund­ing even as Mr Trump vowed to con­tinue fight­ing the elec­tion re­sults.</p>
    <p>Al­though Mr Trump did not con­cede or ac­knowl­edge his Demo­cratic ri­val’s vic­tory on Mon­day, his an­nounce­ment that his staff would co­op­er­ate with Mr Bi­den’s rep­re­sented a sig­nif­i­cant shift and was the clos­est he has come to ad­mit­ting de­feat.</p>
    <p>Mr Bi­den won 306 state-by-state elec­toral votes, well over the 270 needed for vic­tory, against Mr Trump’s 232. Mr Bi­den also holds a lead of more than six mil­lion in the na­tional pop­u­lar vote.</p>
    <p>The Trump cam­paign’s le­gal ef­forts to over­turn the elec­tion out­come have al­most en­tirely failed in key bat­tle­ground states, and a grow­ing num­ber of Repub­li­can lead­ers, busi­ness ex­ec­u­tives and na­tional se­cu­rity ex­perts have urged the Pres­i­dent to let the tran­si­tion be­gin.</p>
    <p>On Mon­day, the Gen­eral Ser­vices Ad­min­is­tra­tion (GSA), the fed­eral agency that must sign off on pres­i­den­tial tran­si­tions, told Mr Bi­den he could for­mally be­gin the han­dover process. GSA ad­min­is­tra­tor Emily Mur­phy said in a let­ter that Mr Bi­den would get ac­cess to re­sources that had been de­nied to him be­cause of the le­gal chal­lenges seek­ing to con­test his win.</p>
    <p>That means Mr Bi­den’s team will now have fed­eral funds and an of­fi­cial of­fice to con­duct his tran­si­tion un­til he takes of­fice on Jan 20. It also paves the way for Mr Bi­den and Vice-Pres­i­dent-elect Ka­mala Har­ris to re­ceive the reg­u­lar na­tional se­cu­rity brief­ings that Mr Trump gets.</p>
    <p>The GSA an­nounce­ment came shortly af­ter Michi­gan of­fi­cials cer­ti­fied Mr Bi­den as the vic­tor in their state, mak­ing Mr Trump’s le­gal ef­forts to change the elec­tion re­sult even more un­likely to suc­ceed.</p>
    <p>Michi­gan’s Board of State Can­vassers voted to cer­tify the elec­tion re­sults, prac­ti­cally en­sur­ing Mr Bi­den’s vic­tory in the state.</p>
    <p>The vote means that only a pos­si­ble Repub­li­can re­quest for a re­count stands in the way of as­sur­ing that Mr Bi­den will win the state and its 16 elec­toral votes.</p>
    <p>The board did not ask for a re­count af­ter cer­ti­fy­ing the re­sults.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump and his ad­vis­ers said he would con­tinue to pur­sue le­gal av­enues but his de­ci­sion to give Ms Mur­phy the go-ahead to pro­ceed with a tran­si­tion for Mr Bi­den’s ad­min­is­tra­tion in­di­cated that even the White House un­der­stood it was get­ting close to the time to move on.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump said on Twit­ter: “Our case STRONGLY con­tin­ues, we will keep up the good... fight, and I be­lieve we will pre­vail! Nev­er­the­less, in the best in­ter­est of our Coun­try, I am rec­om­mend­ing that Emily and her team do what needs to be done with re­gard to ini­tial pro­to­cols, and have told my team to do the same.”</p>
    <p>Mr Trump’s cam­paign on Mon­day asked a fed­eral ap­peals court to re­vive a long-shot chal­lenge to Penn­syl­va­nia’s elec­tion re­sults.</p>
    <p>The cam­paign is ap­peal­ing against a scathing de­ci­sion last Satur­day from a lower court judge who re­jected its claims of wide­spread prob­lems with mail-in bal­lots in Penn­syl­va­nia.</p>
    <p>In a fil­ing with the Third Cir­cuit Court of Ap­peals in Philadel­phia, the cam­paign said it never had a chance to lit­i­gate its “se­ri­ous and well-founded claims” that Demo­cratic of­fi­cials schemed to en­sure Mr Bi­den’s vic­tory by count­ing po­ten­tially tens of thou­sands of de­fec­tive mail bal­lots.</p>
    <p>The Trump cam­paign’s ap­peal is on a fast track.</p>
    <p>On Mon­day, the Gen­eral Ser­vices Ad­min­is­tra­tion, the fed­eral agency that must sign off on pres­i­den­tial tran­si­tions, told Mr Joe Bi­den he could for­mally be­gin the han­dover process... That means Mr Bi­den’s team will now have fed­eral funds and an of­fi­cial of­fice to con­duct his tran­si­tion un­til he takes of­fice on Jan 20.</p>
