    <p>When busi­ness mag­a­zine For­tune ranked Te­masek chief ex­ec­u­tive and ex­ec­u­tive direc­tor Ho Ching the 20th most pow­er­ful woman out­side the United States last month, some news re­ports said she was the only Sin­ga­porean to make it onto the list.</p>
    <p>Ex­cept that she wasn’t.</p>
    <p>An­other Sin­ga­porean, Ms Jes­sica Tan, took the se­cond spot, just be­hind Glax­o­SmithK­line CEO Emma Walm­s­ley, af­ter mak­ing her de­but on the list at fourth place last year.</p>
    <p>While Ms Tan may not be as fa­mous as Ms Ho, she too is an in­dus­try heavy­weight.</p>
    <p>The 43-year-old is co-CEO and tech­nol­ogy czar of China’s fi­nan­cial ser­vices and tech­nol­ogy be­he­moth Ping An Group, which is the coun­try’s largest in­surer.</p>
    <p>HUM­BLE BE­GIN­NINGS</p>
    <p>Speak­ing to The Straits Times from her of­fice in Shen­zhen, the Ke­bun Baru Pri­mary School alumna said suc­cess was not handed to her on a plate.</p>
    <p>Her A-level grades were stel­lar enough to get her into the pres­ti­gious Mas­sachusetts In­sti­tute of Tech­nol­ogy (MIT) in the US in 1996, but she es­chewed the schol­ar­ship route.</p>
    <p>Her fa­ther, who worked in Amer­i­can tech­nol­ogy firm Texas In­stru­ments, even bor­rowed money on his credit card to help fi­nance her over­seas ed­u­ca­tion.</p>
    <p>But in 1998, the Asian fi­nan­cial cri­sis struck, suck­ing her fa­ther’s bank ac­count dry.</p>
    <p>With no money and fac­ing the pos­si­bil­ity of be­ing forced out of school, she ap­plied for fi­nan­cial aid from the univer­sity and jug­gled three jobs.</p>
    <p>Not only did she pull through, she grad­u­ated with two Bach­e­lor of Science de­grees in elec­tri­cal engi­neer­ing and eco­nomics, and a per­fect grade point av­er­age for her master’s in elec­tri­cal engi­neer­ing and com­puter science.</p>
    <p>What she learnt from that ex­pe­ri­ence – in­clud­ing MIT’s will­ing­ness to stump up fi­nan­cial sup­port for her when she most needed it – is that “if you ask for some­thing, you’ll be sur­prised by what you can get”.</p>
    <p>“You just have to go and fight for it,” she said.</p>
    <p>Af­ter grad­u­at­ing in 2000, she stayed on in the US and landed a job at con­sult­ing firm McKin­sey, where she worked in 15 dif­fer­ent coun­tries over 13 years and rose to be­come part­ner.</p>
    <p>TAK­ING RISKS</p>
    <p>Her will­ing­ness to take risks, how­ever, did not ini­tially ex­tend to work­ing in China.</p>
    <p>Her first con­sult­ing pro­ject in 2003, when she was posted back to Sin­ga­pore, was to work with Ping An Group, which was then try­ing to build one of the largest shared ser­vices cen­tres in China.</p>
    <p>She baulked at the prospect of deal­ing with a Chi­nese firm: “My Chi­nese wasn’t as good as it is now, and I wasn’t sure if I would work well with them.”</p>
    <p>But she was im­pressed by the group’s founder, en­tre­pre­neur Peter Ma, who started the com­pany from scratch and strongly en­cour­aged risk-tak­ing.</p>
    <p>“As a con­sul­tant, I had served many top com­pa­nies and CEOs. But many firms be­come more riska­verse as they get larger,” she ex­plained.</p>
    <p>Ten years later, she sum­moned the courage to jump ship to Ping An.</p>
    <p>Call­ing her time spent in China</p>
    <p>“ex­hil­a­rat­ing”, she said it helps that the city of Shen­zhen, where the com­pany is based, has a vi­brant start-up en­vi­ron­ment.</p>
    <p>“With so much growth po­ten­tial, peo­ple are a lot more will­ing to try and in­no­vate new things us­ing tech­nol­ogy.”</p>
    <p>NEW FRON­TIERS</p>
    <p>Some of the new things Ping An has de­vel­oped in­clude an app that can as­sess al­most im­me­di­ately the ex­tent of dam­age in a car ac­ci­dent and de­ter­mine the li­a­bil­ity.</p>
    <p>In­stead of wait­ing for the traf­fic po­lice to ar­rive, all driv­ers need to do is take a 360-de­gree video of the dam­aged ve­hi­cle and up­load it onto the app.</p>
    <p>The com­pany also uses ar­ti­fi­cial in­tel­li­gence (AI) and mod­el­ling to iden­tify sources of en­vi­ron­men­tal pol­lu­tion, us­ing pho­tos taken by com­pa­nies of their fac­to­ries and sur­round­ing rivers that are then up­loaded onto an app.</p>
    <p>Its AI sys­tem is even able to recog­nise mi­cro-ex­pres­sions – the tini­est move­ment of eye mus­cles and around the lips – to de­ter­mine if some­one is ly­ing dur­ing an in­ter­view to as­sess his loan el­i­gi­bil­ity.</p>
    <p>Go­ing for­ward, Ms Tan hopes to bring more pro­fes­sional ser­vices on­line in a big way, es­pe­cially in ed­u­ca­tion and health­care.</p>
    <p>Point­ing out that China has 1.4 bil­lion peo­ple but only a few mil­lion doc­tors, she said the aim is to make telemedici­ne ac­ces­si­ble to ev­ery­one via the mo­bile phone.</p>
    <p>A SENSE OF AD­VEN­TURE</p>
    <p>What has helped fuel her me­te­oric rise up the cor­po­rate ranks, she said, is strong sup­port from her fam­ily liv­ing in Sin­ga­pore, es­pe­cially her mother and hus­band.</p>
    <p>She used to fly back to Sin­ga­pore ev­ery week­end, but with the Covid-19 travel re­stric­tions, she has been home only four times since Chi­nese New Year.</p>
    <p>Be­fore the pan­demic, her week­ends in Sin­ga­pore were planned with mil­i­tary-style pre­ci­sion.</p>
    <p>Said the mother of two daugh­ters, aged 14 and 11: “I or­gan­ised cy­cling trips so I could cover as many peo­ple as pos­si­ble – my par­ents, (two younger) sis­ters and my kids – all at the same time.”</p>
    <p>Her chil­dren have also learnt good time man­age­ment.</p>
    <p>“When my el­der daugh­ter was in Pri­mary 1, she learnt to give spell­ing tests to her­self,” she said with a laugh.</p>
    <p>“We tried to get our daugh­ters to be more self-dis­ci­plined from young and fin­ish their home­work dur­ing the week, so that we can do more mean­ing­ful things to­gether on week­ends.”</p>
    <p>To Sin­ga­pore­ans with doubts about seiz­ing new ca­reer op­por­tu­ni­ties or ven­tur­ing over­seas, she pointed out that she came from “a neigh­bour­hood school that no longer ex­ists”.</p>
    <p>She said: “I’ve learnt to be more thick-skinned. I al­ways tell my girls we should be more risk-tak­ing, and not be afraid to ask for things and go for it.</p>
    <p>“There are many ar­eas where you can take your own ini­tia­tive, to shape and do what you think is mean­ing­ful. This way, you get to do many more things. And it’s also a lot more fun.”</p>
    <p>In 1998, the Asian fi­nan­cial cri­sis struck, suck­ing her fa­ther’s bank ac­count dry. With no money and fac­ing the pos­si­bil­ity of be­ing forced out of school, she ap­plied for fi­nan­cial aid from the univer­sity and jug­gled three jobs. Not only did she pull through, she grad­u­ated with two Bach­e­lor of Science de­grees in elec­tri­cal engi­neer­ing and eco­nomics, and a per­fect grade point av­er­age for her master’s in elec­tri­cal engi­neer­ing and com­puter science.
