    <p>In Bri­tish fic­tion, there were once two kinds of spies.</p>
    <p>There was the James Bond mode – glam­orous, gets the gad­gets and the girls – and then, there were the spies of John le Carre – grim, shabby men whose lives were brack­eted by com­plic­ity and be­trayal.</p>
    <p>“This is a war,” says one such agent, Alec Lea­mas, in The Spy Who Came In From The Cold (1963). “It’s graphic and un­pleas­ant be­cause it’s fought on a tiny scale, at close range; fought with a wastage of in­no­cent life some­times, I ad­mit. But it’s noth­ing, noth­ing at all be­side other wars – the last or the next.”</p>
    <p>Le Carre, who died last Satur­day aged 89, was in his youth a Bri­tish agent. He wrote more than 20 nov­els, in­clud­ing the 10 books that loosely con­sti­tute a se­ries around Cold War spy­mas­ter Ge­orge Smi­ley and the world of the “Cir­cus”, his name for the Se­cret In­tel­li­gence Ser­vice.</p>
    <p>Here are five of his best nov­els.</p>
    <p>1. THE SPY WHO CAME IN FROM THE COLD (1963)</p>
    <p>Pen­guin/Reis­sued 2019/$14.98/ Books Ki­noku­niya</p>
    <p>This novel evis­cer­ated and re­made the spy genre and pro­pelled le Carre to best-selling fame.</p>
    <p>It was in­spired by the Ber­lin Wall, which le Carre ob­served be­ing built. He wrote in a 1989 fore­word: “I will never for­get the time when a dis­gust­ing ges­ture of his­tory co­in­cided with some des­per­ate mech­a­nism in­side my­self, and in six weeks gave me the book that al­tered my life.”</p>
    <p>Af­ter his last op­er­a­tive is shot de­fect­ing from East Ber­lin, dis­graced Bri­tish agent Alec Lea­mas is “put on the shelf”.</p>
    <p>In fact, Lea­mas has been tasked to “stay in the cold” for one fi­nal as­sign­ment: to bring down a pow­er­ful East Ger­man of­fi­cer.</p>
    <p>The book, which shocked read­ers with its de­pic­tion of the amoral­ity of Western es­pi­onage and its twist end­ing, was made into a 1965 film star­ring Richard Bur­ton as Lea­mas.</p>
    <p>2. TINKER TAILOR SOL­DIER SPY (1974)</p>
    <p>Pen­guin Clas­sics/ Reis­sued 2019/$19.26/ Books Ki­noku­niya</p>
    <p>Ge­orge Smi­ley, le Carre’s iconic spy­mas­ter, is brought out of an un­happy re­tire­ment to flush out a Soviet mole in the high­est ech­e­lons of the Cir­cus, a plot that is rem­i­nis­cent of real-life dou­ble agent Kim Philby, who is be­lieved to have be­trayed le Carre, among oth­ers, to the Rus­sians.</p>
    <p>Smi­ley’s ex-boss, Con­trol, had whit­tled the sus­pects down to five men, co­de­named Tinker, Tailor, Sol­dier, Poor Man and Beg­gar­man af­ter a chil­dren’s rhyme.</p>
    <p>This in­tri­cately plot­ted novel is the first of the Karla tril­ogy – fol­lowed by The Honourable School­boy (1977) and Smi­ley’s Peo­ple (1979) – in which Smi­ley faces off against his neme­sis, Soviet es­pi­onage chief Karla.</p>
    <p>It has been adapted for the screen as a 1979 BBC mini-se­ries star­ring Alec Guin­ness as Smi­ley; and as a 2011 film with Gary Old­man.</p>
    <p>3. THE</p>
    <p>LIT­TLE DRUM­MER GIRL (1983)</p>
    <p>Pen­guin Clas­sics/ Reis­sued 2018/ $21.40/Books Ki­noku­niya</p>
    <p>Char­lie, a rad­i­cally minded 26-year-old Bri­tish ac­tress, is plunged from the theatre of the stage into the theatre of the real when she is re­cruited by an Is­raeli spy­mas­ter to snare a Pales­tinian ter­ror­ist.</p>
    <p>As Char­lie is im­mersed in Is­raeli and Pales­tinian ide­olo­gies to play her role, her di­vided loy­al­ties and con­stant para­noia that any­one could be a spy – “ev­ery­one be­longs to some­one”, she re­alises – be­gin to take a toll on her men­tal health.</p>
    <p>A rare le Carre novel led by a woman – the author of­ten came un­der fire for fail­ing to write com­plex fe­male char­ac­ters – it has been adapted for the screen, most re­cently as a tele­vi­sion mini-se­ries in 2018 di­rected by Park Chan-wook, with Florence Pugh as Char­lie.</p>
    <p>4. A PER­FECT SPY (1986)</p>
    <p>Pen­guin Clas­sics/ Reis­sued 2020/$32.10/ Books Ki­noku­niya</p>
    <p>The most au­to­bi­o­graph­i­cal of le Carre’s nov­els, it tells the life story of Bri­tish in­tel­li­gence of­fi­cer Mag­nus Pym, who mys­te­ri­ously dis­ap­pears af­ter his fa­ther’s funeral. His col­leagues sus­pect he has been a Czech dou­ble agent for most of his ca­reer.</p>
    <p>El­e­ments of Mag­nus’ back­story draw on le Carre’s early life and Mag­nus’ fa­ther Rick Pym is based on le Carre’s fa­ther Ron­nie Corn­well, a charm­ing con man with whom le Carre had a trou­bled re­la­tion­ship.</p>
    <p>5. THE CON­STANT GAR­DENER (2001)</p>
    <p>Pen­guin Clas­sics/ Reis­sued 2018/ $21.40/Books Ki­noku­niya</p>
    <p>Justin Quayle, an unas­sum­ing Bri­tish diplo­mat, is pulled into the murky world of phar­ma­ceu­ti­cal cor­rup­tion when his ac­tivist wife Tessa is bru­tally mur­dered while trav­el­ling in north­ern Kenya.</p>
    <p>Justin, a pas­sion­ate gar­dener, turns to dig­ging of a more dan­ger­ous va­ri­ety as he in­ves­ti­gates Tessa’s mur­der and dis­cov­ers an in­ter­na­tional con­spir­acy in­volv­ing drug ex­per­i­men­ta­tion in Africa and a gov­ern­ment hush-up.</p>
    <p>It was made into a 2005 film star­ring Ralph Fi­ennes and Rachel Weisz, who won an Academy Award for Best Sup­port­ing</p>
    <p>Ac­tress for her role as Tessa.</p>
