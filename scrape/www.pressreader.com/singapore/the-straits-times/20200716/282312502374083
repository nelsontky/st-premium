    <p>DUBLIN (Ohio) • Tiger Woods has claimed that he is go­ing to win the Me­mo­rial Tour­na­ment this week de­spite it be­ing his first com­pet­i­tive event in five months and in do­ing so, make PGA Tour his­tory.</p>
    <p>The 44-year-old, who last played on Tour at the Gen­e­sis In­vi­ta­tional in Fe­bru­ary, goes into to­day’s start of the Me­mo­rial seek­ing an 83rd win that would eclipse Sam Snead’s mark of 82, set in 1965.</p>
    <p>“I would like to say that I’m go­ing to win the event,” the 15-time Ma­jor win­ner, who has won the tour­na­ment a record five times, said on the BBC.</p>
    <p>“That’s my i ntent com­ing in, that’s my in­tent go­ing into every event.”</p>
    <p>The Amer­i­can, who tied Snead’s record by win­ning the Zozo Cham­pi­onship in Ja­pan l ast Oc­to­ber, added: “Whether that plays out come Sun­day, hope­fully that will be the case. There’s no rea­son why I can’t do it again this week.”</p>
    <p>A stiff back ham­pered his per­for­mance at the Gen­e­sis, where he fin­ished 68th of 68 play­ers who made the cut, but he said he had not been trou­bled since.</p>
    <p>“I feel so much bet­ter than I did then. Phys­i­cally, I was very stiff in Los An­ge­les, and I was not mov­ing that well.</p>
    <p>“Back was just not quite loose, it was cold, I wasn’t hit­ting the ball very far, and con­se­quently I fin­ished dead last,” said the for­mer world No. 1, who also played in May at The Match: Cham­pi­ons for Char­ity with Phil Mick­el­son and Na­tional Foot­ball League stars Tom Brady and Pey­ton Man­ning.</p>
    <p>World No. 14 Woods, who is mak­ing only his fourth tour­na­ment ap­pear­ance of the sea­son this week, added that he has im­proved his health dur­ing the long lay­off.</p>
    <p>“I’ve been able to train and con­cen­trate on get­ting back up to speed and back up to tour­na­ment speed.”</p>
    <p>He ad­mit­ted on Tues­day that con­cern over the coro­n­avirus de­layed his re­turn to ac­tion as he pre­pares to tee off at Muir­field Vil­lage Golf Club in Ohio.</p>
    <p>Woods, the last Amer­i­can golfer ranked in the top 30 to re­turn to the Tour, said he had con­tem­plated re­turn­ing to the Tour ear­lier but had wanted to see how the first few events of the post-coro­n­avirus shut­down fared be­fore com­ing back.</p>
    <p>“I just felt it was bet­ter to stay at home and be safe,” Woods said.</p>
    <p>“I’m used to play­ing with lots of peo­ple around me or hav­ing lots of peo­ple have a di­rect line to me, and that puts not only my­self in dan­ger but also my friends and fam­ily. I have just been at home prac­tis­ing and so­cial dis­tanc­ing and be­ing away from a lot of peo­ple.</p>
    <p>“Com­ing back and play­ing the Tour... I’m used to hav­ing so many peo­ple around me or even touch me, go­ing from green to tee.</p>
    <p>“That’s some­thing that I looked at and said, ‘Well, I’m re­ally not quite com­fort­able with that’.”</p>
    <p>Me­mo­rial or­gan­is­ers had ini­tially planned to al­low fans on the course but aban­doned the idea as Covid-19 cases across the United States be­gan to sky­rocket. On Mon­day, PGA Tour of­fi­cials con­firmed that the re­main­der of the sea­son would take place with­out fans. It means Woods will tee off to­day along­side world No. 1 Rory McIl­roy and No. 6 Brooks Koepka with­out the cus­tom­ary horde of spec­ta­tors that usu­ally fol­lows him around a course.</p>
    <p>“It’s go­ing to be dif­fer­ent, there’s no doubt about it,” Woods said.</p>
    <p>“To have no one yelling, no one scream­ing, no en­ergy, the so­cial dis­tanc­ing, no hand­shakes, there’s noth­ing to feed off en­ergy-wise.</p>
    <p>“It’s just a silent and dif­fer­ent world.”</p>
