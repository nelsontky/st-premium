        THE STRAITS TIMES A21 SATURDAY, JANUARY 2, 2021 | | | NEWSFOCUS The eight finalists are: Cai Yinzhou Anil David The 30-year-old was the first to flag the need to keep migrant workers safe amid Covid-19, and is a forerunner in efforts to break down social barriers between Singaporea­ns and migrant workers. The 52-year-old offers a new lease of life to former offenders by employing them at his social enterprise Agape Connecting People. Having been in prison himself, he knows the importance of having an opportunit­y for a fresh start. SINGAPOREA­N OF THE YEAR 2020 Ian Ang and Alaric Choo, Co-founders of Secretlab Young entreprene­urs, 28-year-old Ian Ang and 32-year-old Alaric Choo, delved head first into the market when they launched their gaming chair business in 2015, and have since put Singapore on the map by being one of the top gaming chair manufactur­ers in the world, delivering their products to over 60 countries. Who among these eight finalists is your choice for The Straits Times Singaporea­n of the Year 2020 Award? Lim Ee Chin Marcus Wee, Aftershock PC Without a care for her own safety, 81-year-old Madam Lim, a retired factory worker, rushed to fill pails of water to help extinguish the flames coming from her neighbour’s unit. The 36-year-old entreprene­ur has brought the boutique PC builder company he founded in 2012 to greater heights, making its mark overseas in markets like Malaysia and Australia. Pamela Chng, Bettr Barista Zulkifli Atnawi and Project Hills The 44-year-old entreprene­ur decided to set up coffee business Bettr Barista as a force for good after taking a year off work due to burnout. The company has a programme to help vulnerable women and youth at-risk learn vocational and life skills. The retired cleaner, 60, checked in on his rental-flat neighbours and bought groceries for those struggling to cope with the pandemic. Together with his children, they initiated ground-up initiative Project Hills. The award, in partnershi­p with UBS for the sixth year running, seeks to honour Singaporea­ns who have made a positive impact and celebrate the triumph of the human spirit. Each of these nominees has a powerful story that will resonate with, and inspire, all of us. Front-line fighters against Covid-19 Amid the Covid-19 pandemic, an army of front-liners put in their utmost efforts to keep Singaporea­ns safe, working long hours and exposing themselves to possible risks of infection. Their unselfish dedication to their jobs despite the personal sacrifices was an inspiratio­n as the country battled the new virus.
