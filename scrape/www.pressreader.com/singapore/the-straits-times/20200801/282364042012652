    <p>MEM­PHIS (Ten­nessee) • Brooks Koepka has strug­gled in his last three tour­na­ments, miss­ing the cut in two of them, while en­dur­ing pain in his sur­gi­cally re­paired left knee.</p>
    <p>But the for­mer world No. 1 might be com­ing into form ahead of next week’s PGA Cham­pi­onship at TPC Hard­ing in San Fran­cisco, where he will be de­fend­ing his Ma­jor ti­tle.</p>
    <p>The four-time Ma­jor cham­pion got his de­fence of the WGC-FedEx St Jude In­vi­ta­tional crown off to a fly­ing start, nail­ing birdies on his first four holes on Thurs­day.</p>
    <p>He was smok­ing out of the gate and did not let up through­out the open­ing round to close with an eight-un­der 62, two strokes clear of fel­low Amer­i­cans Rickie Fowler and Bren­don Todd. He is also eight in front of new world No. 1, Jon Rahm of Spain.</p>
    <p>On match­ing his ca­reer-low round on the PGA Tour, the 30-year-old at­trib­uted his im­prove­ment – af­ter sev­eral dis­mal dis­plays since the cir­cuit’s restart in June – to be­ing re­united with his coach Pete Cowen.</p>
    <p>Be­fore the Mem­phis event, the duo had not been able to meet due to the coro­n­avirus pan­demic and Koepka re­vealed he was thank­ful for the tough love af­ter over four months of sep­a­ra­tion.</p>
    <p>“With Pete, it’s more psy­cho­log­i­cal,” he said. “He’ll beat me down, tell me I can’t do some­thing, he’ll jump on me pretty good and I en­joy that when some­one tells me I can’t do some­thing.</p>
    <p>“Telling me I’m not go­ing to win, it will be awhile... I ap­pre­ci­ate ev­ery­thing that Pete does, even though he is chew­ing me out.</p>
    <p>“I drove it well, putted well, chipped it well. I did ev­ery­thing very solid. I never re­ally felt like I was hav­ing to work too hard out there, so that’s a lit­tle dif­fer­ent than it has been.</p>
    <p>“The con­fi­dence has been there. It is a mat­ter of go­ing out and do­ing it. It is go­ing to come around. It feels like I am back to nor­mal, so it is good to see a good re­sult.”</p>
    <p>Since suf­fer­ing a torn patella ten­don last year, Koepka has been un­der­go­ing stem-cell treat­ment while opt­ing to put off surgery.</p>
    <p>Choos­ing not to go un­der the knife has meant hours on the greens tin­ker­ing with the me­chan­ics of his swing and his leg po­si­tion­ing, and he is hope­ful of re­cov­er­ing the form that has seen him win suc­ces­sive PGA of Amer­ica Player of the Year awards.</p>
    <p>“We put in a lot of work and found some­thing by mak­ing a lit­tle ad­just­ment in my set-up – where my weight dis­tri­bu­tion was go­ing,” he added.</p>
    <p>“It is click­ing and it feels good. It feels back to nor­mal. I feel way more in con­trol.”</p>
    <p>Like the re­main­der of the PGA Tour cal­en­dar, the PGA Cham­pi­onship will be held be­hind closed doors.</p>
    <p>Or­gan­is­ers con­firmed on Thurs­day that for­mer Ma­jor cham­pi­ons Francesco Moli­nari of Italy and Ire­land’s Padraig Har­ring­ton will not be part of the field.</p>
    <p>The pair, who have not played on the PGA Tour since its re­sump­tion, will be re­placed by Amer­i­cans Troy Mer­ritt and Talor Gooch.</p>
