    <p>On­line rat­ings of prop­erty agents will now be stan­dard­ised across the real es­tate in­dus­try in Sin­ga­pore, fol­low­ing the launch of a new guide yes­ter­day by the Coun­cil for Es­tate Agen­cies. The stan­dard­i­s­a­tion is a nec­es­sary step to help con­sumers find agents who suit them when con­duct­ing their searches on­line.</p>
    <p>On­line rat­ings of prop­erty agents will now be stan­dard­ised across the real es­tate in­dus­try in Sin­ga­pore fol­low­ing the launch of a new guide yes­ter­day by the Coun­cil for Es­tate Agen­cies (CEA).</p>
    <p>Pre­vi­ously, real es­tate agen­cies de­ter­mined the stan­dards for con­sumer rat­ings, but the guide aims to in­tro­duce con­sis­tent stan­dards, such as the key at­tributes on which agents should be rated.</p>
    <p>Now, the rat­ings will re­flect whether an agent pro­vided ser­vices above and be­yond the client’s ex­pec­ta­tions, such as by us­ing dig­i­tal cal­cu­la­tors, and if the agent was open, hon­est and re­li­able, and had the nec­es­sary skills to fa­cil­i­tate a favourable deal for his client.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, Min­is­ter of State in the Prime Min­is­ter’s Of­fice and the Min­istry of Na­tional De­vel­op­ment (MND) Tan Kiat How said the stan­dard­i­s­a­tion is a nec­es­sary step to help con­sumers find agents who suit them when con­duct­ing their searches on­line.</p>
    <p>“With these key cat­e­gories in place and a stan­dard way of as­sess­ing, col­lect­ing and dis­play­ing these at­tributes, we can make sure that</p>
    <p>com­par­isons are fair, cred­i­ble and con­sis­tent across the board,” he said.</p>
    <p>He was speak­ing at CEA’s vir­tual cel­e­bra­tion of its 10th an­niver­sary.</p>
    <p>The guide also in­cludes rec­om­mended safe­guards to ver­ify the au­then­tic­ity of a trans­ac­tion and the client’s iden­tity to pre­vent false rat</p>
    <p>ings, said Mr Tan.</p>
    <p>This ini­tia­tive is part of the real es­tate in­dus­try trans­for­ma­tion map launched by MND and CEA in 2018.</p>
    <p>It is de­vel­oped by the Rat­ings of Prop­erty Agents Work­group in part­ner­ship with key play­ers from the real es­tate agency in­dus­try, con­sumer as­so­ci­a­tion and prop­erty por­tal in­dus­try.</p>
    <p>Three prop­erty agen­cies – ERA Realty Net­work, OrangeTee & Tie and Hut­tons Asia – along with the Sin­ga­pore Es­tate Agents As­so­ci­a­tion and prop­erty por­tal Prop­er­tyGuru have com­mit­ted to adopt­ing the guide.</p>
    <p>They cover around 80 per cent of prop­erty agents in the in­dus­try.</p>
    <p>There are about 1,200 prop­erty agen­cies and 30,000 agents in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, Mr Tan said a prop­erty pur­chase is of­ten the big­gest fi­nan­cial com­mit­ment for many Sin­ga­pore­ans and that agents should re­mind con­sumers to as­sess their fi­nan­cial cir­cum­stances be­fore com­mit­ting to pur­chases.</p>
    <p>“Even as the in­dus­try ex­plores new ways of mar­ket­ing prop­er­ties and reach­ing out to con­sumers on­line, we must con­tinue to pay spe­cial at­ten­tion to en­sure ad­vice ren­dered is ac­cu­rate, mea­sured and takes into con­sid­er­a­tion the over­all eco­nomic out­look,” said Mr Tan.</p>
    <p>Since the CEA was es­tab­lished as a statu­tory board un­der the MND in Oc­to­ber 2010, the num­ber of com­plaints against prop­erty agen­cies and agents has de­clined from 1,170 cases in 2011 to 777 last year.</p>
    <p>CEA’s ex­ec­u­tive di­rec­tor Lim Chee Hwee said: “This is an ex­cel­lent op­por­tu­nity for the in­dus­try to be more re­silient and pro­gres­sive, and CEA will be most keen to part­ner the prop­erty agen­cies and in­dus­try as­so­ci­a­tions to fur­ther trans­form the in­dus­try.”</p>
