    <p>Malaysia’s long­est-serv­ing prime min­is­ter Ma­hathir Mo­hamad will set up an­other Malay-based po­lit­i­cal party, and will not align it with ei­ther of the two largest blocs in Par­lia­ment, he an­nounced yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The party, which has yet to be named, will be formed by Tun Dr Ma­hathir along with four other MPs who are cur­rently in­de­pen­dent af­ter be­ing re­moved from Parti Pribumi Ber­satu Malaysia (Ber­satu), which is led by Prime Min­is­ter Muhyid­din Yassin.</p>
    <p>Dr Ma­hathir said the new party will be “be­bas” – or in­de­pen­dent – from the other po­lit­i­cal blocs.</p>
    <p>The for­mer premier, 95, will be its chair­man while his son, Datuk Seri Mukhriz Ma­hathir, is ex­pected to be its pres­i­dent. The party will add to the crowded po­lit­i­cal scene in Malaysia – es­pe­cially ones serv­ing the Malay elec­torate.</p>
    <p>Three Malay-based par­ties – Ber­satu, Umno and Parti Is­lam SeMalaysia – are cur­rently in the same bloc that forms the gov­ern­ing Perikatan Na­sional al­liance.</p>
    <p>An­other is the Malay-ma­jor­ity, mul­tira­cial Parti Kead­i­lan Rakyat (PKR), led by Datuk Seri An­war Ibrahim.</p>
    <p>PKR, with yet an­other Malay fac­tion, Parti Amanah Ne­gara, is in the op­po­si­tion Pakatan Hara­pan (PH) coali­tion with Chi­nese-based Demo­cratic Ac­tion Party.</p>
    <p>“I know there are al­ready too many Malay po­lit­i­cal par­ties, but the other (Malay) par­ties have de­vi­ated from their orig­i­nal strug­gles,” Dr Ma­hathir said at a press con­fer­ence.</p>
    <p>Dr Ma­hathir’s de­ci­sion to set up an in­de­pen­dent party signals his in­creas­ingly strained re­la­tion­ship with Mr An­war, who heads the three-party PH op­po­si­tion bloc.</p>
    <p>“We would like to work with Pakatan Hara­pan, but there are some ob­sta­cles there,” said Dr Ma­hathir , whose an­nounce­ment fol­lowed yes­ter­day’s de­ci­sion by the High Court on the ap­pli­ca­tion by Tan Sri Muhyid­din, who is also pres­i­dent of Ber­satu, and three oth­ers to strike out a law­suit by Dr Ma­hathir and four other peo­ple.</p>
    <p>The High Court ac­cepted Mr Muhyid­din’s ap­pli­ca­tion to dis­miss the law­suit over the re­vo­ca­tion of their party mem­ber­ship.</p>
    <p>On July 23, Dr Ma­hathir said that if the court de­ci­sion was not in his favour, he would form a new party.</p>
    <p>Dr Ma­hathir and Mr Muhyid­din founded Ber­satu in 2016, but they split up fol­low­ing the col­lapse of the then rul­ing PH coali­tion at the end of Fe­bru­ary this year, af­ter Mr Muhyid­din and some 40 other MPs de­fected to form the Perikatan Na­sional al­liance.</p>
