    <p>HONG KONG • Hong Kong Chief Ex­ec­u­tive Car­rie Lam has de­fended her de­ci­sion to post­pone the city’s Leg­isla­tive Coun­cil (Legco) elec­tion due to the wors­en­ing coron­avirus out­break, stress­ing that vot­ers will not be de­prived of their rights.</p>
    <p>She said yes­ter­day that the de­ci­sion was based on the ob­jec­tive de­vel­op­ment of the epi­demic, with­out po­lit­i­cal con­sid­er­a­tions.</p>
    <p>The gov­ern­ment must also con­sider the rights of vot­ers stranded over­seas, she added in an in­ter­view with broad­caster TVB.</p>
    <p>“We es­ti­mate that there are hun­dreds of thou­sands of peo­ple stranded in the main­land or over­seas,” she said.</p>
    <p>“If we... con­tinue the elec­tion un­der the se­vere epi­demic, and peo­ple are wor­ried about the risk of in­fec­tion, more than seven mil­lion peo­ple i n Hong Kong may be harmed.”</p>
    <p>The elec­tion was slated for Sept 6, but has been post­poned by a whole year to Sept 5, 2021.</p>
    <p>Mrs Lam, whose pub­lic support lev­els are at an all-time l ow, pointed out that Hong Kong has no over­seas vot­ing or elec­tronic vot­ing ar­range­ments.</p>
    <p>“If we hope to bet­ter deal with fu­ture un­ex­pected events that make it im­pos­si­ble to carry out the usual elec­tion process, we should se­ri­ously con­sider, for ex­am­ple, in the case of Sin­ga­pore, over­seas vot­ing,” she said.</p>
    <p>Mrs Lam also ex­pressed hope that the in­fight­ing in the Legco would end in the com­ing year so that work would con­tinue as per</p>
    <p>CON­SIDER OVER­SEAS VOT­ING</p>
    <p>If we hope to bet­ter deal with fu­ture un­ex­pected events that make it im­pos­si­ble to carry out the usual elec­tion process, we should se­ri­ously con­sider, for ex­am­ple, in the case of Sin­ga­pore, over­seas ’’ vot­ing.</p>
    <p>HONG KONG CHIEF EX­EC­U­TIVE CAR­RIE LAM, point­ing out that the city has no over­seas vot­ing or elec­tronic vot­ing ar­range­ments.</p>
    <p>nor­mal dur­ing the “vac­uum pe­riod” or the du­ra­tion that the cur­rent gov­ern­ment term is ex­tended by.</p>
    <p>“Some leg­is­la­tors have adopted a re­sis­tance strat­egy. For ex­am­ple, it was re­cently pointed out that if the op­po­si­tion seizes more than half of the Legco, no pol­icy will be passed – an in­dis­crim­i­nate move to block ev­ery­thing. This po­si­tion of com­plete re­sis­tance is dis­ad­van­ta­geous to the pub­lic.”</p>
    <p>Asked if she was wor­ried about be­ing sanc­tioned by Western coun­tries, Mrs Lam said these coun­tries have used the post­pon­ing of the elec­tion as a pre­text to at­tack Hong Kong, but her ad­min­is­tra­tion has a re­sponse plan.</p>
    <p>The con­tro­ver­sial move throws up ques­tions of le­git­i­macy.</p>
    <p>Vet­eran po­lit­i­cal watcher, As­so­ci­ate Pro­fes­sor Sing Ming, told The Sun­day Times: “If there’s no leg­is­la­ture at all and the gov­ern­ment would leg­is­late, that would be­come even more ab­surd be­cause that vi­o­lates the Ba­sic Law... The pro­ce­dural le­git­i­macy of any pro­vi­sional leg­is­la­ture will be un­der­mined.”</p>
