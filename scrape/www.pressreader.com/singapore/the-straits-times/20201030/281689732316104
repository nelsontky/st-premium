    <p>PUTRAJAYA • Malaysia’s Na­tional Se­cu­rity Coun­cil will study pro­posed health pro­to­cols for a by­elec­tion in Sarawak that will be held i n early De­cem­ber, with strict mea­sures to be in place due to rag­ing Covid-19 cases in next-door Sabah, a se­nior of­fi­cial said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Se­nior Min­is­ter Is­mail Sabri Yaakob said the gov­ern­ment as well as the Elec­tion Com­mis­sion (EC) do not have the au­thor­ity to post­pone the elec­tion as the fed­eral Con­sti­tu­tion stip­u­lates that a va­cant par­lia­men­tary seat must be filled within 60 days.</p>
    <p>“We are aware and we un­der­stand the con­cerns of vot­ers. We were told that even elec­tion staff are ap­pre­hen­sive to be on duty as the num­ber of Covid-19 cases are on the rise,” he said on Tues­day. “But there is no choice but to pro­ceed with the by-elec­tion.”</p>
    <p>He said the EC will be pre­sent­ing its pro­posed pro­to­cols for the by­elec­tion to the coun­cil some time this week, which has to be stricter to avoid new cases be­ing recorded.</p>
    <p>He said the EC needs to look into ways to min­imise voter move­ment and con­tact with one an­other, es­pe­cially dur­ing polling.</p>
    <p>Polling date for the Batu Sapi by­elec­tion has been set for Dec 5, while nom­i­na­tion day is on Nov 23.</p>
    <p>The EC had al­ready set sev­eral con­di­tions for the cam­paign pe­riod, in­clud­ing not al­low­ing di­rect, house-to-house cam­paign­ing, walk­a­bouts and po­lit­i­cal ral­lies.</p>
    <p>The Batu Sapi fed­eral par­lia­men­tary seat fell va­cant fol­low­ing the death of Datuk Liew Vui Keong on Oct 2, be­lieved to be due to lung in­fec­tion.</p>
