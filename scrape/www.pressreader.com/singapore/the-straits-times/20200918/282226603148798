    <p>•</p>
    <p>SHEN­ZHEN Chi­nese con­sumers are rush­ing to buy smart­phones from Huawei Tech­nolo­gies fea­tur­ing its high-end Kirin chips, fear­ing curbs on the firm’s ac­cess to US tech­nol­ogy will soon cut off pro­duc­tion of its pre­mium hand­sets.</p>
    <p>Phone ven­dors in Huaqiang­bei, the world’s largest elec­tron­ics mar­ket lo­cated in the south­ern city of Shen­zhen, said prices for new and used Huawei phones had risen steadily over the past month, by about 400 to 500 yuan on av­er­age.</p>
    <p>The Porsche de­sign model of</p>
    <p>Huawei’s flag­ship Mate 30 was sell­ing for 14,000 yuan (S$2,850), up from 10,000 yuan in Jan­uary, one ven­dor said. The phone was avail­able at a sim­i­lar price on on­line mar­ket­place Taobao.</p>
    <p>Con­sumers are in­creas­ingly wor­ried over the sup­ply of com­po­nents for newer hand­sets, said one ven­dor. “The Huawei phones are get­ting ex­pen­sive but that’s sup­ply and de­mand,” said the ven­dor, who gave her name as Xiao. “If peo­ple like the brand, they’ll pay more – and who knows how good the chips they’ll have in the fu­ture will be?”</p>
    <p>The US gov­ern­ment last year moved to prevent most US com­pa­nies from con­duct­ing busi­ness with Huawei, say­ing the world’s big­gest maker of mo­bile telecom­mu­ni­ca­tions equip­ment and smart­phones was ul­ti­mately an­swer­able to the Chi­nese gov­ern­ment.</p>
    <p>Huawei has re­peat­edly denied be­ing a na­tional se­cu­rity risk.</p>
    <p>Last month, the United States fur­ther tight­ened re­stric­tions to choke its ac­cess to com­mer­cially avail­able chips, prompt­ing Tai­wan Semi­con­duc­tor Man­u­fac­tur­ing (TSMC) to stop ship­ping wafers to Huawei.</p>
    <p>Mr Richard Yu, chief ex­ec­u­tive of Huawei’s con­sumer busi­ness, later said the com­pany will stop mak­ing its Kirin chips on Sept 15, cit­ing Amer­i­can mea­sures to cut off its chip­mak­ing unit HiSil­i­con from vi­tal tech­nol­ogy.</p>
    <p>HiSil­i­con re­lies on soft­ware from US firms such as Ca­dence De­sign Sys­tems and Synop­sys to de­sign its chips, and out­sources pro­duc­tion to TSMC, which uses US-made equip­ment.</p>
    <p>Whole­sale traders at the mar­ket said they had been busy for the last month meet­ing ex­tra de­mand for on­line sales, with prices of high­erend phones ris­ing ev­ery few hours. They were un­cer­tain how much sup­ply re­mained at dis­trib­u­tors.</p>
    <p>Huawei does not dis­close in­ven­tory in­for­ma­tion. A spokesman told Reuters the firm con­tin­ues to op­er­ate ac­cord­ing to de­mand.</p>
    <p>It likely has chip in­ven­tory to last through the first half of next year, said an­a­lyst Will Wong at con­sul­tancy IDC.</p>
    <p>“One op­tion for them to have Kirin chips last longer is to cut ship­ments for the rest of the year,” Mr Wong said.</p>
    <p>Last week, Huawei said it planned to in­tro­duce its Har­mony op­er­at­ing sys­tem on smart­phones next year, in part to over­come US lim­its on its ac­cess to Al­pha­bet Inc’s An­droid.</p>
    <p>Yet an­a­lyst Mo Jia at Canalys said launch­ing Har­mony would only be a “sym­bolic in­no­va­tion” if Huawei no longer had the chip sup­plies to make high-end phones.</p>
