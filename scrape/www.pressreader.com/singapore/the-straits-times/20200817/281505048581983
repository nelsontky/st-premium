    <p>A decade after Sin­ga­porean bil­lion­aire Peter Lim made an am­bi­tious at­tempt to buy English Premier League (EPL) gi­ants Liver­pool, lo­cal en­trepreneur­s Ter­ence Loh and Nel­son Loh are now spear­head­ing a bid to take over an­other English club, New­cas­tle United.</p>
    <p>The cousins are co-founders of Bel­la­graph Nova (BN) Group – along with Evan­ge­line Shen – which owns over 30 en­ti­ties across 100 coun­tries in ma­jor busi­ness fields, in­clud­ing fi­nance, sports, health­care, lux­ury goods, en­ter­tain­ment and ro­bot­ics. The Paris-based com­pany is worth an es­ti­mated US$12 bil­lion (S$16.5 bil­lion).</p>
    <p>In a state­ment to the me­dia, BN Group con­firmed last Satur­day that its co-founders “are at an ad­vanced stage of ne­go­ti­a­tion” for the takeover, hav­ing al­ready pro­vided a let­ter of in­tent and proof of funds.</p>
    <p>It added that they are “will­ing to mas­sively con­trib­ute to the devel­op­ment of the club through their solid and in­ter­na­tional struc­ture and a com­bined busi­ness/sport de­vot­ing mind­set”.</p>
    <p>The BN Group has also en­gaged New­cas­tle leg­end and for­mer Eng­land cap­tain Alan Shearer and for­mer Mag­pies for­ward Michael Cho­pra to back their bid.</p>
    <p>Cit­ing “con­fi­den­tial­ity given the highly sen­si­tive na­ture of the trans­ac­tion”, a rep­re­sen­ta­tive de­clined fur­ther com­ment when con­tacted by The Straits Times.</p>
    <p>Pre­vi­ously in­vest­ment bankers at JPMor­gan, the Loh cousins are known to be keen sports fans, hav­ing spon­sored lo­cal pro­fes­sional race driver Yuey Tan, the na­tional Muay Thai team, and the St Michael’s Soc­cer As­so­ci­a­tion.</p>
    <p>BN Group also owns Dorr Group Rac­ing Team, who have raced in the Porsche Car­rera Cup Asia and Porsche Mo­bil 1 Su­per­cup since 2012.</p>
    <p>If the bid gets the green light, the Lohs will be the first Sin­ga­pore­ans to con­trol an EPL club.</p>
    <p>Lim, who owns Span­ish La Liga side Va­len­cia, saw his bid for Liver­pool fall through in 2010, while Sin­ga­porean busi­ness­man Bill Ng aimed to buy Scot­tish Premier League side Rangers in 2012 but even­tu­ally with­drew his of­fer.</p>
    <p>Founded in 1892, New­cas­tle are a strongly sup­ported club who have won four top-flight league ti­tles and six FA Cups. The Mag­pies, man­aged by Steve Bruce, fin­ished 13th in the 2019-2020 sea­son.</p>
    <p>BN Group’s in­ter­est pro­vides New­cas­tle owner Mike Ash­ley with an al­ter­na­tive after a £300 mil­lion (S$538.2 mil­lion) bid funded by Saudi Ara­bia’s Pub­lic In­vest­ment Fund fell through.</p>
    <p>English Premier League chief ex­ec­u­tive Richard Masters said the pro­posed takeover col­lapsed after the group de­clined to take up the Premier League’s of­fer of in­de­pen­dent ar­bi­tra­tion to de­cide who would own the club.</p>
    <p>New­cas­tle fan Ter­ence Ong, 34, called the takeover bid by the Lohs “a po­ten­tial breath of fresh air after 13 hor­ri­ble years with Mike Ash­ley”, cit­ing the owner’s con­cern about the bot­tom line and “lack of am­bi­tion”.</p>
    <p>“Al­though fi­nances mat­ter, foot­ball can­not be run like a busi­ness and I hope the new own­ers re­alise that and en­gage the fans bet­ter, con­sid­er­ing that suc­cess­ful teams al­ways man­age to get fans on their side,” said the Sin­ga­porean, a mar­ket­ing man­ager.</p>
    <p>“The na­tion­al­ity of the prospec­tive own­ers doesn’t re­ally mat­ter. As long as they can prove their cre­den­tials and show they have the best in­ter­est of the club at heart, it is some­thing worth con­sid­er­ing.</p>
    <p>“Of course, if hav­ing Sin­ga­porean own­ers means the team will have more of a pres­ence here, that is also good for the New­cas­tle fan base here.”</p>
    <p>FANS MAT­TER TOO</p>
    <p>Al­though fi­nances mat­ter, foot­ball can­not be run like a busi­ness and I hope the new own­ers re­alise that and en­gage the fans bet­ter, con­sid­er­ing that suc­cess­ful teams al­ways man­age to get fans on their side. ’’</p>
    <p>TER­ENCE ONG, mar­ket­ing man­ager and New­cas­tle fan, who is ex­cited about the Sin­ga­pore group’s bid.</p>
