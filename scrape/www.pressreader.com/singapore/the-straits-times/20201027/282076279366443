    <p>I am very dis­ap­pointed that the rec­tor of Tem­busu Col­lege Tommy Koh would choose to make a joke out of an im­por­tant is­sue.</p>
    <p>He had of­fered to re­sign over Na­tional Univer­sity of Sin­ga­pore’s (NUS) mis­han­dling of the dis­missal of a don over sex­ual mis­con­duct al­le­ga­tions but re­tracted his res­ig­na­tion of­fer two hours later.</p>
    <p>Prof Koh told To­day he was merely jok­ing when he made the res­ig­na­tion of­fer.</p>
    <p>An es­teemed in­sti­tu­tion like NUS can­not al­low its “rather con­ser­va­tive cul­ture” to im­pinge on its so­cial obli­ga­tion to pro­tect the stu­dent body from harm.</p>
    <p>When Prof Koh of­fered his res­ig­na­tion, it sig­nalled a sin­cer­ity and de­ter­mi­na­tion to nudge NUS to play a more proac­tive role in han­dling mis­de­meanours in fu­ture.</p>
    <p>But to down­play his res­ig­na­tion of­fer and say it was just a joke leaves a bad af­ter­taste. It triv­i­alises the stu­dents’ de­mand for more trans­parency and ac­count­abil­ity from NUS in fu­ture.</p>
    <p>I hope that peo­ple of in­flu­ence would set a good ex­am­ple by say­ing what they mean and do­ing what they say.</p>

    <p>It is not too late be­cause the con­trac­tual ar­range­ments for the project are not com­plete yet, and it can be fur­ther de­layed.</p>
    <p>MR YOUN SE-JONG,</p>
    <p>di­rec­tor of cli­mate fi­nance at non-profit or­gan­i­sa­tion So­lu­tions for Our Cli­mate, on how a with­drawal from the Vung Ang 2 coal project might be in the in­ter­est of play­ers in­volved.</p>
