    <p>It was a more bit­ter than sweet ex­pe­ri­ence for some 200 durian lovers who made large or­ders with an on­line seller only to be left with empty prom­ises.</p>
    <p>Some claim they placed or­ders rang­ing from $300 to $900 with duri­an­sex­press­de­liv­ery.com, but there was no ex­press de­liv­ery or duri­ans at all.</p>
    <p>The cus­tomers have since started a Face­book group to share their ex­pe­ri­ences and at­tempt to seek re­course. Two of them told The Straits Times that they had filed po­lice re­ports, and an­other three said they were con­sid­er­ing do­ing like­wise.</p>
    <p>ST in­ter­viewed 20 peo­ple who had made or­ders to­talling over $8,000 on the same web­site. They had e-state­ments show­ing pay­ments made via credit card, debit card or In­ter­net bank­ing.</p>
    <p>House­wife An­nie Ng, 31, said she waited an en­tire af­ter­noon on July 10 for the $500 worth of duri­ans she had or­dered. Un­able to con­tact the seller hours later, her sit­u­a­tion be­gan to reek of a scam.</p>
    <p>After some on­line sleuthing, she re­alised that the site she had pa­tro­n­ised had a very sim­i­lar URL to duri­an­ex­press­de­liv­ery.com, the web­site of a le­git­i­mate busi­ness, Durian Ex­press De­liv­ery – with a barely no­tice­able dif­fer­ence of an “s”.</p>
    <p>Most of the cus­tomers ST spoke to said they had seen In­sta­gram and Face­book posts by “Top Grade Durian” that of­fered ex­press de­liv­er­ies within three hours, from 11am to 11pm daily. They vis­ited the linked web­site at duri­an­sex­press­de­liv­ery.com, where they selected the num­ber of duri­ans they wanted to pur­chase. The check­out process was sim­i­lar to those of on­line food de­liv­ery ser­vices, they said.</p>
    <p>How­ever, all 20 cus­tomers ST spoke to said they did not re­ceive elec­tronic re­ceipts or in­voices by e-mail – which raised a red flag, as it is a com­mon prac­tice in e-com­merce to fol­low up with an e-re­ceipt.</p>
    <p>Ms Ng said she and her hus­band had paid around $35 per kg for the duri­ans, which worked out to over $120 for each fruit, which av­er­ages 3kg to 4kg each.</p>
    <p>“The thing that in­fu­ri­ates me most about the sit­u­a­tion is that we got scammed not be­cause we were be­ing cheap and wanted to get duri­ans at lower prices. We thought we were pay­ing a pre­mium for the best duri­ans ever but we ended up get­ting cheated,” Ms Ng said.</p>
    <p>She said that duri­an­sex­press­de­liv­ery.com was taken down a day after she filed a po­lice report on July 13.</p>
    <p>A man in his 40s, who gave his name only as Mr Muham­mad, told ST that he had or­dered $600 worth of duri­ans as a birth­day present for his wife.</p>
    <p>“It was hard to find pre­mium duri­ans dur­ing the circuit breaker and phase one, so I thought it was a good pur­chase for a spe­cial oc­ca­sion,” he said.</p>
    <p>“We are still in the process of fil­ing com­plaints with Case and we hope to get our money back and get some jus­tice.” Case is the Con­sumers As­so­ci­a­tion of Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>Be­sides the 20 cus­tomers whose or­ders were not ful­filled, two oth­ers told ST that they had in­deed re­ceived duri­ans – but that the fruits were frozen hard with rot­ting seeds and flesh. They have both made po­lice re­ports after the com­pany re­fused to pro­vide them with a re­fund.</p>
    <p>Checks by ST re­vealed that the com­pany, Top Grade Cheap Frozen Durian, was set up in June un­der a Jasper Tan Zhi Hong who was reg­is­tered with a Tampines HDB res­i­den­tial ad­dress. At­tempts to reach Mr Tan at the ad­dress and via cell­phone were un­suc­cess­ful.</p>
    <p>A check with the Ac­count­ing and Cor­po­rate Reg­u­la­tory Author­ity yes­ter­day found that the com­pany changed its ad­dress on July 14, and now lists the Or­chard Road ad­dress of a man­age­ment con­sul­tancy firm of a com­pletely dif­fer­ent name. Staff at the firm said they did not know of Mr Tan and have not heard of his com­pany at all.</p>
    <p>ST also con­tacted Durian Ex­press De­liv­ery, but did not re­ceive a re­ply as of press time.</p>
