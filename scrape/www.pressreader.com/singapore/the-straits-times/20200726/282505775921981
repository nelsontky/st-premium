    <p>LILLE (France) • He is the new wizard of French ice cream who is send­ing a chill down the spine of tra­di­tion­al­ists.</p>
    <p>Chef David Wes­mael has noth­ing against a scoop of well-made gelato or a cone of whipped ice cream. But the rest­less innovator is tak­ing a blow­torch to the “ar­chaic” con­ven­tions which he claims have left ice cream frozen in the past.</p>
    <p>His cre­ations of­ten skate dar­ingly over the thin line be­tween i ce cream and the more so­phis­ti­cated do­main of French patis­serie.</p>
    <p>Bit­ing through the thin choco­late shell of one of his ice cream bars, flavours and tex­tures ex­plode – from crunchy pra­line to runny caramel to vanilla spiked with lemon con­fit.</p>
    <p>“There are so many things you can do with ice cream – more per­haps in terms of tex­ture and taste than even with patis­serie,” he said in the chill of his lab­o­ra­tory in the north­ern French city of Lille.</p>
    <p>“There is in­fi­nite po­ten­tial and so many pos­si­bil­i­ties which have yet to be ex­plored in ice-cream mak­ing,” said the for­mer star pas­try chef.</p>
    <p>From his spher­i­cal “vacherins” of filled meringue to ice cream bon­bons, bars and “tubes” which can be cut into slices, Wes­mael is de­ter­mined to give the sum­mer treat a place at the top ta­ble of haute cui­sine.</p>
    <p>“I am try­ing to do some­thing dif­fer­ent and show the pub­lic that ice cream is not some­thing that just comes in a pot or a cor­net,” he said.</p>
    <p>It is a chilly 11 deg C in his lab­o­ra­tory, but his ar­ti­san “glaciers” are not feel­ing the cold in their white coats.</p>
    <p>Ev­ery sec­ond out of the freezer counts when you are pip­ing a chilled hazel­nut and al­mond pra­line onto short­bread in a bar mould.</p>
    <p>The same speed and pre­ci­sion is needed for the next step of float­ing the caramel and can­died lemon in vanilla ice cream, so that the mid­dle melts as soon as you bite through the crisp coat­ing.</p>
    <p>Wes­mael also loves mak­ing the stan­dard ice creams that he him­self calls “ar­chaic”.</p>
    <p>But even with tra­di­tional i ce creams and sor­bets, he adds his own touch, dec­o­rat­ing ev­ery tub by hand and com­ing up with new flavours ev­ery week for his shops in Paris and Lille – from straw­berry and red pep­per to Spritz and even vanilla, cel­ery and lemon.</p>
    <p>When it comes to mirac­u­lously trans­form­ing raw ma­te­ri­als, “noth­ing beats ice cream and sor­bet”, he said.</p>
    <p>It was this alchemy and the un­tapped po­ten­tial of ice cream that tempted him away from pure patis­serie, which has un­der­gone a huge re­nais­sance in France in re­cent years.</p>
    <p>Even his stan­dard vanilla i ce cream is the prod­uct of deep re­search, mix­ing pods from Mada­gas­car and New Cale­do­nia to get a “stronger and longer-last­ing flavour”.</p>
    <p>For his com­pe­ti­tion en­try i n 2004 to join the tiny elite of French ar­ti­sans of­fi­cially pro­claimed the coun­try’s best, the young Wes­mael cre­ated a frozen sculp­ture of “an an­gel preg­nant with the world” that rep­re­sented the Ital­ian Re­nais­sance.</p>
    <p>Around it were frozen desserts based around basil, l emon, bal­samic vine­gar and Si­cil­ian pis­ta­chios.</p>
    <p>As it hap­pens, pis­ta­chio is the best-sell­ing ice cream in both his shops.</p>
    <p>But he is most proud of his “tubes”, which are easy to cut and can sur­vive out of the freezer for two hours, thanks to the cylin­der they come in.</p>
    <p>“You can slice them into rounds, put dif­fer­ent flavours to­gether or add dif­fer­ent el­e­ments from the gar­den like a coulis of fresh mint or straw­ber­ries in sea­son,” he said.</p>
