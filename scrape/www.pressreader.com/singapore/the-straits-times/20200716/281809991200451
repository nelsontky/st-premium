    <p>NEW YORK • Alabama, Florida and North Carolina re­ported record daily i ncreases i n deaths from Covid-19 on Tues­day, grim new mile­stones that mark a sec­ond wave of in­fec­tions surg­ing across much of the United States.</p>
    <p>Florida, which has be­come an epi­cen­tre of the new out­break, re­ported 133 new Covid-19 fa­tal­i­ties on Tues­day, rais­ing the state’s death toll to more than 4,500.</p>
    <p>“We must all con­tinue to do our part to pro­tect Florida’s most vul­ner­a­ble and avoid the 3 Cs: closed spaces, crowded places and closec­on­tact set­tings,” Gov­er­nor Ron DeSan­tis wrote on Twit­ter. “Safe­guard­ing the el­derly and those with un­der­ly­ing health con­di­tions will con­tinue to be our top pri­or­ity.”</p>
    <p>Ms Mandi Hawke, who runs a small chil­dren’s book com­pany near Fort Laud­erdale, said she re­cently made her first trip to the lo­cal mall in months and was “hor­ri­fied” by what she saw.</p>
    <p>“Al­most no one was wear­ing masks. I walked past an ale house and every­one was jammed in right next to one another, laugh­ing and jok­ing, hav­ing a good time but no masks,” said Ms Hawke, 38. “As bad as things are in south Florida, I feel they’re only go­ing to get worse. We are not get­ting a grip on this.”</p>
    <p>Alabama re­ported a record spike of 40 deaths on Tues­day, while North Carolina had an in­crease of 35, bring­ing each state’s to­tal to over 1,100.</p>
    <p>The num­ber of new US cases re­ported daily be­gan ris­ing about six weeks ago, driven by in­creases in south­ern and western states. Texas saw a record 10,745 new cases on Tues­day.</p>
    <p>With more than 3.5 mil­lion cases, the United States has one of the high­est rates of cases per capita in the world. It ranks sev­enth in fa­tal­i­ties per capita among the 20 coun­tries with the most cases, record­ing more than 139,000 deaths.</p>
    <p>Deaths have be­gun ris­ing for the first time since mid-April when com­par­ing the weekly change in fa­tal­i­ties, ac­cord­ing to a Reuters anal­y­sis.</p>
    <p>US Vice-Pres­i­dent Mike Pence on Tues­day vis­ited Louisiana, which re­ported nearly 13,000 new cases last week. The state’s at­tor­ney-gen­eral Jeff Landry can­celled a meet­ing with Mr Pence af­ter test­ing pos­i­tive for the coro­n­avirus.</p>
    <p>Against the back­drop of ris­ing cases and deaths, many US school dis­tricts have been con­fronted with a dif­fi­cult choice of re­sum­ing classes or us­ing only on­line teach­ing.</p>
    <p>Both Florida and New York state have said stu­dents will be al­lowed to re­turn to school.</p>
    <p>North Carolina’s gov­er­nor on Tues­day or­dered schools to re­open if safety mea­sures can be met but said dis­tricts can opt to go with on­line learn­ing.</p>
    <p>Cal­i­for­nia’s two largest school dis­tricts, Los An­ge­les and San Diego, have said that stu­dents will be kept home for the term be­gin­ning next month.</p>
    <p>Dis­tricts re­fus­ing to al­low stu­dents to re­turn to school are at odds with US Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump, who has said he may with­hold fed­eral funds or re­move their tax-ex­empt sta­tus. Most schools are fi­nanced largely by state and lo­cal taxes.</p>
    <p>In an in­ter­view with CBS News on Tues­day, Mr Trump lam­basted Los An­ge­les and San Diego school dis­tricts, say­ing it was a mis­take for them to pro­vide only on­line ed­u­ca­tion.</p>
    <p>“I would tell par­ents and teach­ers that you should find your­self a new per­son, who­ever’s in charge of that de­ci­sion, be­cause it’s a ter­ri­ble de­ci­sion,” Mr Trump said.</p>
    <p>“Be­cause chil­dren and par­ents are dy­ing from that trauma too. They’re dy­ing be­cause they can’t do what they’re do­ing. Mothers can’t go to work be­cause all of a sud­den they have to stay home and watch their child, and fa­thers,” he said.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump’s cam­paign views the re­open­ing of class­rooms, en­abling par­ents to get back to work, as a key to eco­nomic re­cov­ery and a boost to his re-elec­tion chances on Nov 3.</p>
    <p>The na­tion’s 98,000 pub­lic schools are a cor­ner­stone of the econ­omy, pro­vid­ing child­care for work­ing par­ents, em­ploy­ing eight mil­lion work­ers prior to the pan­demic, and pre­par­ing some 50 mil­lion stu­dents to join the US work­force.</p>
