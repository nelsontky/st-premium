    <p>South Korean ac­tress Park So-dam may be the break­out star of the Os­car-win­ning film Par­a­site (2019), but she is the one do­ing the gawk­ing in the se­ries Record Of Youth.</p>
    <p>The 29-year-old plays Jeong-ha, an as­pir­ing make-up artist who meets her favourite male model through work.</p>
    <p>She says over e-mail that in real life, she is a huge fan of the vet­eran ac­tress Kim Hye-soo, known for K-dra­mas like Sig­nal (2016) and Hyena (2020).</p>
    <p>“I would re­ally like to work with her and have many con­ver­sa­tions with her some day. I’ve only been able to greet her at awards cer­e­monies so far, but I’m thank­ful be­cause she al­ways cheers me on and holds my hands warmly.</p>
    <p>“I would like to look into her eyes and feel and learn when I watch her act in per­son, be­cause I’ve al­ways felt moved by her en­ergy,” she says.</p>
    <p>Record Of Youth, which re­cently pre­miered on Net­flix and is a top 10 ti­tle on the plat­form in Sin­ga­pore, is a com­ing-of-age ro­mance set in the com­pet­i­tive mod­el­ling and en­ter­tain­ment in­dus­try.</p>
    <p>Park So-dam teams up with ac­tors Park Bo-gum and Byeon Woo-seok, who both play up-and­com­ing male mod­els.</p>
    <p>Byeon, him­self a model-turnedac­tor who made his name with se­ries like Flower Crew: Joseon Mar­riage Agency (2019), drew on his own ex­pe­ri­ence for the role.</p>
    <p>The 28-year-old says: “I watched a lot of videos of my past run­way walks and I prac­tised a lot through sim­u­la­tions.”</p>
    <p>He adds of his char­ac­ter: “He’s some­one born with a sil­ver spoon in his mouth and so he’s very free and op­ti­mistic as a result.</p>
    <p>“How­ever, he can’t stand the scru­tiny sur­round­ing the ben­e­fits he gets from his wealthy back­ground and he must work to over­come that.”</p>
    <p>While mod­el­ling is some­thing Byeon al­ready knows, play­ing a make-up artist was an eye-open­ing ex­pe­ri­ence for Park So-dam.</p>
    <p>“When Jeong-ha works at the salon, she wears a wire­less ear­piece for com­mu­ni­ca­tion. This made me think of the staff who ac­tu­ally have to wear them, and how dif­fi­cult and hec­tic it must be work­ing at a salon. They may not be able to hear well and might feel un­com­fort­able wear­ing an ear­piece for a long time,” she says.</p>
    <p>The other lead­ing man of the se­ries, Park Bo-gum (Love In The</p>
    <p>Moon­light, 2016), en­listed for his manda­tory mil­i­tary ser­vice at the end of last month and did not take part in the in­ter­view with re­gional press.</p>
    <p>Still, the 27-year-old star shared some of his thoughts about film­ing the se­ries in a press re­lease.</p>
    <p>He says: “We were al­ways so happy on set that some­times we weren’t able to stop laugh­ing and then we would have to re­take scenes. I was very joy­ful ev­ery time I was on my way to film­ing.”</p>
    <p>Record Of Youth is avail­able on Net­flix.</p>
