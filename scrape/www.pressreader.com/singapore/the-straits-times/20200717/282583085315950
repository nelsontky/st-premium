    <p>When Mr Nigel Chua, sec­ond­gen­er­a­tion owner of Founder Bak Kut Teh, posted a heartfelt ap­peal on so­cial me­dia on Wed­nes­day to save his reel­ing 42-year-old es­tab­lish­ment, it was met with a mix of cheers and crit­i­cism.</p>
    <p>Many ne­ti­zens rooted for him and said they would make it a point to dine at his chain of four restau­rants, which was started in 1978 by Mr Chua’s 75-year-old fa­ther Chua Ch­wee Whatt.</p>
    <p>Oth­ers called it a shame­less pub­lic­ity stunt to drum up busi­ness in a time of mass food and bev­er­age restau­rant clo­sures.</p>
    <p>Some even ad­vised him to con­sol­i­date his busi­ness – which has ex­panded to Jalan Sul­tan, Down­town East and in Bugis – and fo­cus on keep­ing stan­dards con­sis­tent at his orig­i­nal flag­ship Balestier out­let. The busi­ness also has off­shoots in China, Tai­wan, Viet­nam and In­done­sia, which are man­aged by over­seas part­ners.</p>
    <p>In his post, Mr Chua, 45, said the home-grown brand is in dan­ger of clos­ing in the next two months as busi­ness has plum­meted by 85 per cent over the last five months, which he de­scribed as the “most tir­ing, try­ing and dif­fi­cult” ever.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker, he closed the Balestier and Bugis out­lets as tourists make up the bulk of their cus­tomers, but con­tin­ued pay­ing em­ploy­ees 85 per cent of their salaries.</p>
    <p>They waited out the clo­sure pe­riod, an­tic­i­pat­ing the re­turn of hun­gry hordes in phase two, but the re­open­ing of the econ­omy turned out to be a false dawn.</p>
    <p>“My dad was elated, grin­ning from ear to ear, and glee­fully headed down to the restau­rant in the wee hours to pre­pare the aro­matic bak kut teh broth him­self. We were hope­ful that the sit­u­a­tion would turn for the bet­ter. But we were wrong,” says Mr Chua.</p>
    <p>Since then, they have been keep­ing afloat by re­ly­ing on take­aways and de­liv­er­ies, “but our ef­forts are still in­suf­fi­cient”, he laments.</p>
    <p>To en­cour­age din­ers to re­turn, he is offering over 30 per cent dis­count off set menus at three of his out­lets (Jalan Sul­tan, Bugis and Down­town East) from to­day to Aug 17.</p>
    <p>Mr Chua says he will also be com­ing up with new dishes to at­tract cus­tomers back and reach­ing out to land­lords to help with low­er­ing rent.</p>
    <p>“We un­der­stand that all hawk­ers and food and bev­er­age busi­nesses are strug­gling, and we are in a des­per­ate, dire sit­u­a­tion. The open let­ter is not just a plea for us, but for those in the in­dus­try suf­fer­ing as well. We hope that Sin­ga­pore­ans will be able to help us stay afloat,” he says.</p>
    <p>There has been a slew of F&B ca­su­al­ties in the past few months.</p>
    <p>Clo­sures this month in­clude Peru­vian restau­rant Tono Ce­vicheria at</p>
    <p>Duo Gal­le­ria and Ja­panese iza­kaya Neon Pi­geon in Keong Saik Road.</p>
    <p>Bri­tish gas­tropub Oxwell & Co at Ann Siang Hill closes to­mor­row and is in the midst of look­ing for a new lo­ca­tion.</p>
    <p>Mr Ben Jones, chief ex­ec­u­tive of­fi­cer of M. Group – the hos­pi­tal­ity group be­hind Oxwell & Co – adds this plea: “The in­dus­try is hav­ing a tough time and needs your sup­port. Eat in, take out, tip well and show your ap­pre­ci­a­tion. Ev­ery lit­tle bit helps.”</p>
