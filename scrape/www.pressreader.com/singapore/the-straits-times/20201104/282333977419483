    <p>There have been 11 in­ci­dents of lapses in Covid-19 sam­ple test­ing re­ported to the Min­istry of Health (MOH) to date for fur­ther investigat­ions.</p>
    <p>This is out of a to­tal of 3.68 mil­lion tests per­formed as at Oct 26, Health Min­is­ter Gan Kim Yong said in a writ­ten re­ply yes­ter­day to a par­lia­men­tary ques­tion from Ms Cheng Li Hui (Tampines GRC).</p>
    <p>Three of the 11 in­ci­dents were re­lated to self-re­ported ap­pa­ra­tus and equip­ment is­sues and had no im­pact on the test re­sults, while another three were re­lated to im­proper spec­i­men han­dling, which caused a back­log or de­lay in test re­sults.</p>
    <p>The re­main­ing five in­ci­dents were re­lated to qual­ity con­trol and re­port­ing lapses, which caused er­rors in test re­sults.</p>
    <p>“MOH was able to take quick ac­tions to ad­dress any public health is­sues aris­ing from these cases,” said Mr Gan.</p>
    <p>“MOH treats all in­ci­dents se­ri­ously and our investigat­ions as­sessed them to be iso­lated events, and did not re­sult from any sys­temic lab­o­ra­tory is­sues.”</p>
    <p>Mr Gan added that the min­istry re­quires clin­i­cal lab­o­ra­to­ries to re­view their pro­cesses when such in­ci­dents oc­cur, iden­tify the root cause and take ap­pro­pri­ate cor­rec­tive and pre­ven­ta­tive ac­tions.</p>
    <p>He said the ad­e­quacy and ap­pro­pri­ate­ness of each lab­o­ra­tory’s re­view and ac­tions taken are also as­sessed by MOH.</p>
    <p>Mr Gan also ad­dressed a ques­tion from Work­ers’ Party MP He Ting Ru (Sengkang GRC), who had asked whether there have been any re­ported or sus­pected “long Covid” cases in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>This refers to re­ports that some Covid-19 pa­tients over­seas have ex­pe­ri­enced long-last­ing, lin­ger­ing symp­toms even after they have re­cov­ered from the in­fec­tion.</p>
    <p>In his re­sponse, Mr Gan said that “long Covid” is cur­rently not well de­fined and is the sub­ject of on­go­ing stud­ies.</p>
    <p>“MOH has thus far not re­ceived any re­ports of ‘long Covid’.</p>
    <p>“How­ever, our healthcare in­sti­tu­tions are fol­low­ing their re­cov­ered pa­tients closely to look for pro­longed and lin­ger­ing symp­toms aris­ing from Covid-19 as well as for late com­pli­ca­tions from the in­fec­tion,” he said.</p>
    <p>“We will also con­tinue to mon­i­tor the emerg­ing find­ings on long-term ef­fects of Covid-19.”</p>
