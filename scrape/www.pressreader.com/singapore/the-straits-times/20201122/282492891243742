    <p>There is a lone durian tree hid­den some­where in Jalan Be­sar.</p>
    <p>It is found in an ur­ban farm tucked away on the sev­enth storey of One Far­rer Ho­tel, ac­ces­si­ble to only ho­tel guests and con­va­lesc­ing pa­tients at Far­rer Park Hos­pi­tal.</p>
    <p>“The tree was planted more than five years ago and it hasn’t pro­duced fruit yet,” said One Far­rer’s hor­ti­cul­tur­ist Chin Ai Ling dur­ing a farm tour for The Sun­day</p>
    <p>Times last month.</p>
    <p>While the durian har­vest may still be some years away, pas­sion­fruit, mint leaves and kangkong from the farm, about the size of nine Hous­ing Board five-room flats, have made their way to the din­ing plates of ho­tel guests and hos­pi­tal pa­tients.</p>
    <p>For a durian fan, the durian tree was one of the big­gest sur­prises dur­ing the stay­ca­tion.</p>
    <p>An­other was the five com­pli­men­tary meals that the ho­tel serves to its Sky­line Ho­tel guests.</p>
    <p>One Far­rer di­vides its ho­tel into three zones – an Ur­ban Ho­tel at lev­els 11 to 15, du­plex Loft Apart­ments that strad­dle lev­els 16 and 17, and the Sky­line Ho­tel and Sky Vil­las at lev­els 18 to 20.</p>
    <p>The five meals are break­fast, lunch, af­ter­noon snacks, din­ner, and sweet and savoury sup­per, from 7am to 10pm. Round-the­clock free meals are typ­i­cally found on cruises, but are less com­mon in ho­tels.</p>
    <p>The ac­com­mo­da­tion dur­ing the one-night stay was the Orchid Villa at level 20 of the ho­tel, or the pent­house floor.</p>
    <p>The 105 sq m villa com­prises two bed­rooms and a liv­ing and din­ing room. My wife Priscilla and I oc­cu­pied one bed­room, and our chil­dren – Daniel, 22, and Deb­o­rah, 14 – the other.</p>
    <p>A wide dou­ble-panel door opens into the liv­ing and din­ing room, and it is flanked on both sides by the bed­rooms, each with sep­a­rate en­trances.</p>
    <p>This lay­out means par­ents and chil­dren get their own pri­vate spa­ces, even as they share the liv­ing and din­ing room.</p>
    <p>This ar­range­ment may not be suit­able for fam­i­lies with young chil­dren who need con­stant at­ten­tion, but those with older chil­dren will ap­pre­ci­ate the pri­vacy.</p>
    <p>For ex­am­ple, my chil­dren made a spon­ta­neous visit to the ho­tel gym at 1am with­out wak­ing us up.</p>
    <p>Each of the bed­rooms comes with its own jacuzzi at the bal­cony, with par­tial views of the Sin­ga­pore Flyer and the Ma­rina Bay sky­line.</p>
    <p>I was hes­i­tant about us­ing the jacuzzi – what if some­one peeps from the next build­ing?</p>
    <p>The worry was un­founded be­cause the near­est build­ing is about 100m away, far enough to avoid pry­ing eyes.</p>
    <p>The high­light of the stay­ca­tion was the pri­vate din­ing. The ho­tel chefs pre­pared a four-course Western meal for villa guests and two but­lers served the din­ner. It was the full works.</p>
    <p>We had smoked salmon for starters, co­gnac-scented shell­fish soup, braised beef cheek for the main course and baked Alaska for dessert.</p>
    <p>The dessert was a vis­ual treat. It was cov­ered with a candy floss dome and re­vealed it­self only af­ter Grand Marnier liqueur lit with flame was poured over the floss (see the video).</p>
    <p>But the food was only half the ex­pe­ri­ence.</p>
    <p>The din­ing room felt like it was trans­planted from a mu­seum – it was lined with paint­ings and 200-year-old Kh­mer arte­facts, a pair of late 18th-cen­tury tem­ple roof finials. The paint­ings and arte­facts are from the Far­rer Park Com</p>
    <p>pany Art Col­lec­tion.</p>
    <p>The arte­facts in­trigued my son Daniel, a his­tory buff, who started a mono­logue over din­ner on how the world was like in the 18th cen­tury. “This is his­tor­i­cal wood. When th­ese finials were built… fill in the blank,” he asked.</p>
    <p>“Sin­ga­pore was a fish­ing vil­lage and not yet dis­cov­ered by the Bri­tish, and the In­dus­trial Rev­o­lu­tion had just be­gan,” he replied to him­self.</p>
    <p>The stay at the villa was a se­ries of sur­prises that grad­u­ally un­folded – from the durian tree to soak­ing in a jacuzzi with a view of the sky­line to pri­vate din­ing in a pent­house.</p>
    <p>But days af­ter the stay, what I re­called most vividly were nei­ther the paint­ings nor the arte­facts, nor the ex­pe­ri­ence of be­ing served din­ner by two but­lers, nor the durian tree.</p>
    <p>The im­age that popped up in my mind was the sight of yel­low but­ter­flies and bees buzzing among basil plants in the ur­ban farm.</p>
    <p>And that was what made the stay­ca­tion mem­o­rable – it was dis­cov­er­ing an oa­sis in the mid­dle of the city, hid­den in plain sight.</p>

    <p>INSIDER TIP</p>
    <p>The five com­pli­men­tary meals are served in the Sky­line Lounge on the 18th floor of the ho­tel. Af­ter you are filled with food, ask for cof­fee to be served at the out­door seat­ing area, where you get a view of the sky­line as well as a cas­cad­ing wa­ter­fall.</p>
