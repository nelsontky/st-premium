    <p>The as­sis­tant div­ing su­per­vi­sor of a ship re­pair com­pany was sen­tenced to 12 weeks’ jail yes­ter­day over an un­der­wa­ter in­ci­dent in 2014 which led to the death of a diver. The com­pany was fined $300,000 over the in­ci­dent, dur­ing which the diver was killed af­ter he was sucked into a ship’s pipe open­ing.</p>
    <p>The as­sis­tant div­ing su­per­vi­sor of a ship re­pair com­pany was sen­tenced to 12 weeks in jail yes­ter­day over an un­der­wa­ter in­ci­dent in 2014 which led to the death of a diver.</p>
    <p>The com­pany, Un­der­wa­ter Con­trac­tors, was sen­tenced to a $300,000 fine over the in­ci­dent, dur­ing which diver Kwok Khee Khoon was killed af­ter he was sucked into a ship’s pipe open­ing.</p>
    <p>The com­pany and its su­per­vi­sor, David Ng Wei Li, 37, had each been found guilty of an of­fence un­der the Work­place Safety and Health Act in Fe­bru­ary this year, fol­low­ing a trial.</p>
    <p>The in­ci­dent oc­curred at the Eastern Work­ing An­chor­age, near Ma­rina South Pier, on June 4, 2014. Un­der­wa­ter Con­trac­tors had been en­gaged to carry out un­der­wa­ter sur­vey works on ves­sel Frisia Kiel.</p>
    <p>Mr Kwok was one of six divers work­ing at the ship’s bow thrusters when he was seen be­ing sucked into a pipe open­ing in the ves­sel.</p>
    <p>Sev­eral at­tempts by other divers to pull him away from the open­ing failed and he was re­trieved only af­ter the pump in the star­board sea chest – which is meant to suck in sea­wa­ter to cool the ship’s en­gines and gen­er­a­tors – was shut down.</p>
    <p>Mr Kwok was mo­tion­less, and paramedics pro­nounced him dead at around 7.40pm that day.</p>
    <p>He was later found to have died of trau­matic as­phyxia.</p>
    <p>In their ear­lier sub­mis­sions, Min­istry of Man­power pros­e­cu­tors Delvin­der Singh and Shanty Priya had ar­gued that the safest way to per­form the div­ing works would have been to com­pletely shut down the pumps in the sea chest that the divers were to work in.</p>
    <p>This was not done in the in­ci­dent – the pumps were kept op­er­at­ing at “re­duced flow” in­stead.</p>
    <p>The pros­e­cu­tors had also said Ng had in­structed the divers to per­form the work de­spite know­ing that there was a risk of them be­ing sucked into the sea chest.</p>
    <p>Mr Alfred Lim and Ms Jaime Lye, lawyers for both the com­pany and Ng, said their clients are in­tend­ing to ap­peal against both their con­vic­tions and sen­tences.</p>
    <p>For their re­spec­tive of­fences, the com­pany could have been fined up to $500,000, while Ng could have been jailed for up to two years and fined up to $30,000.</p>
