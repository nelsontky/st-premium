    <p>COPEN­HAGEN • Large parts of Europe yes­ter­day geared up for broad new re­stric­tions to stop the coro­n­avirus af­ter in­fec­tions world­wide topped 30 mil­lion.</p>
    <p>Bri­tain is lim­it­ing gath­er­ings and France is set to roll out new curbs for ma­jor cities as gov­ern­ments across the con­ti­nent bat­tle fresh spikes in the disease.</p>
    <p>The Span­ish cap­i­tal of Madrid said it has been over­whelmed by the virus and called for de­ci­sive ac­tion from the cen­tral gov­ern­ment, which is set to un­veil a raft of new re­stric­tions.</p>
    <p>Madrid of­fi­cials warned that the re­gion’s health­care sys­tem is com­ing un­der in­creas­ing pres­sure, with one in five hos­pi­tal beds oc­cu­pied by Covid-19 pa­tients amid a sec­ond wave of the ill­ness.</p>
    <p>Anx­i­ety has been grow­ing in the city about the prospect of a re­turn to lock­down af­ter a top re­gional health of­fi­cial raised the pos­si­bil­ity for the worst-hit ar­eas.</p>
    <p>“It would be bad for shops, for small busi­nesses and lit­tle bars that sur­vive on peo­ple com­ing in,” said Ms Mari­bel Que­sada, 55. “Peo­ple are re­ally sick of be­ing at home; the lock­down was very dif­fi­cult.”</p>
    <p>In Bri­tain, new curbs took ef­fect yes­ter­day, with Prime Min­is­ter Boris Johnson warn­ing that pubs may have to close ear­lier to avoid a</p>
    <p>“sec­ond hump” of in­fec­tions.</p>
    <p>About two mil­lion peo­ple i n north-east Eng­land, in­clud­ing in the cities of New­cas­tle and Sun­der­land, will no longer be al­lowed to meet peo­ple out­side their homes. Only table ser­vice will be al­lowed in bars, and en­ter­tain­ment venues will have to close by 10pm.</p>
    <p>The gov­ern­ment al­ready i mposed rules across Eng­land on Mon­day lim­it­ing so­cial­is­ing to groups of six or fewer, as daily cases reached lev­els not seen since early May.</p>
    <p>Bri­tish min­is­ters yes­ter­day de­clined to rule out the pos­si­bil­ity of im­pos­ing a short na­tional lock­down to tackle the surge in cases.</p>
    <p>The French au­thor­i­ties are also pre­par­ing tighter re­stric­tions in sev­eral cities to cur­tail a resur­gence that has seen nearly 10,000 new cases per day in the past week.</p>
    <p>Health Min­is­ter Olivier Veran said Lyon and Nice would be un­der new rules by to­day, af­ter curbs on gath­er­ings were i mposed this week in Bordeaux and Mar­seille.</p>
    <p>France reg­is­tered a record 10,593 new cases i n 24 hours, Health Min­istry data showed on Thurs­day, the coun­try’s high­est sin­gle-day count.</p>
    <p>The rise fol­lowed a gov­ern­ment de­ci­sion to make Covid-19 tests free, lead­ing to a surge in test­ing and an in­crease in in­fec­tion rates.</p>
    <p>The min­istry re­ported that the cu­mu­la­tive num­ber of cases had risen to over 415, 000 and the death toll had risen by 50 to 31,095, the sec­ond-high­est num­ber of new deaths in a day in two months.</p>
    <p>About 1.2 mil­lion tests were car­ried out last week, the health min­is­ter said. Data shows 5.4 per cent of tests were pos­i­tive.</p>
    <p>The Czech Repub­lic reg­is­tered a record high of 3,130 new Covid-19 cases on Thurs­day, reach­ing in 24 hours a fig­ure com­pa­ra­ble with that for the en­tire month of March, its Health Min­istry data showed yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>It was the third straight daily record for the Euro­pean Union mem­ber of 10.7 mil­lion peo­ple, which has reg­is­tered more than 44,000 cases and 489 deaths since the March out­break.</p>
    <p>Is­rael be­came the first devel­oped coun­try to en­force a sec­ond na­tion­wide shut­down yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The move sparked protests in Tel Aviv late on Thurs­day when hun­dreds took to the streets against the re­stric­tions, which took ef­fect just hours be­fore the Jewish New Year and cover other re­li­gious hol­i­days, in­clud­ing Yom Kip­pur.</p>
    <p>The coun­try has the world’s sec­ond-high­est virus in­fec­tion rate af­ter Bahrain. Un­der its new mea­sures, res­i­dents will be lim­ited to within 500m of their homes.</p>
    <p>As anger grows over how the au­thor­i­ties world­wide have re­sponded to the virus, some gov­ern­ments are fac­ing le­gal ac­tion from ci­ti­zens over al­leged fail­ures.</p>
    <p>A French as­so­ci­a­tion of Covid-19 vic­tims plans to file a le­gal com­plaint against Prime Min­is­ter Jean</p>
    <p>Cas­tex, its lawyer said.</p>
    <p>Suits have also been filed in China by be­reaved rel­a­tives but many have had them abruptly re­jected, while dozens of oth­ers face pres­sure from the au­thor­i­ties not to file, ac­cord­ing to peo­ple in­volved.</p>
    <p>Fam­i­lies of vic­tims ac­cuse the gov­ern­ments in Wuhan city and Hubei prov­ince, ground zero of the pan­demic, of con­ceal­ing the out­break when it first emerged, fail­ing to alert the public and bungling the re­sponse.</p>
    <p>“They say the epi­demic was a nat­u­ral calamity. But these se­ri­ous out­comes are man-made, and you need to find who is to blame,” said pensioner Zhong Han­neng, whose son died of the virus.</p>
    <p>“Our fam­ily is shat­tered,” she added. “I can never be happy again.”</p>
