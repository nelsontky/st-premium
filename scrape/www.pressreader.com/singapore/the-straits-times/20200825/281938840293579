    <p>WASHINGTON • This week’s Repub­li­can Na­tional Con­ven­tion will be a four-day cel­e­bra­tion of Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump, fea­tur­ing a younger gen­er­a­tion that may be hop­ing for a shot at the White House in 2024, as well as a St Louis cou­ple who bran­dished guns at anti-racism pro­test­ers.</p>
    <p>Pro­test­ers op­pos­ing Mr Trump took to the streets of Char­lotte, North Carolina – where the con­ven­tion is held – for a third straight night on Sun­day, ahead of Mr Trump’s nom­i­na­tion yes­ter­day for a sec­ond term.</p>
    <p>Here is a look at speak­ers fea­tured in a mix of live and vir­tual pro­gram­ming of the con­ven­tion that started yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>TRUMP AND FAM­ILY</p>
    <p>The theme of the nom­i­nat­ing con­ven­tion will be “Hon­our­ing the Great Amer­i­can Story”, and will cul­mi­nate in a live ac­cep­tance speech by Mr Trump on Thurs­day night (Fri­day morn­ing Sin­ga­pore time) from the South Lawn of the White House.</p>
    <p>The Pres­i­dent, who trails Demo­cratic nom­i­nee Joe Bi­den in opin­ion polls ahead of the Nov 3 elec­tion, will be the cen­tral fo­cus and will speak each night, ac­cord­ing to cam­paign sources, in­clud­ing at one event where he will hon­our doc­tors, nurses and other work­ers on the front line of the fight against the Covid-19 pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump’s chil­dren, in­clud­ing Ms Ivanka Trump, Mr Don­ald Trump Jr and Mr Eric Trump, will also get prom­i­nent speak­ing roles.</p>
    <p>Some govern­ment ethics ex­perts have ex­pressed con­cern over the use of fed­eral prop­er­ties as stages for par­ti­san po­lit­i­cal speeches, but a law pro­hibit­ing the use of fed­eral funds for cam­paign ap­pear­ances ex­cludes the pres­i­dent and vi­cepres­i­dent.</p>
    <p>In 1940, Demo­cratic Pres­i­dent Franklin D. Roo­sevelt ac­cepted his party’s nom­i­na­tion from the White House via ra­dio.</p>
    <p>Repub­li­cans are look­ing to strike a more op­ti­mistic vi­sion for the coun­try, seek­ing a con­trast with what they saw as the Democrats’ more omi­nous per­spec­tive laid out at their con­ven­tion last week.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, the con­ven­tion theme was the “Land of Prom­ise”, to­day’s is “Land of Op­por­tu­nity”, to­mor­row will be fo­cused on the “Land of Heroes” and events will con­clude on Thurs­day with the “Land of Great­ness”.</p>
    <p>‘TRUMP CHANGED MY LIFE’</p>
    <p>Mr Trump has been crit­i­cised for his re­sponse to the coro­n­avirus pan­demic, which has killed more than 170,000 Amer­i­cans and trig­gered a se­vere eco­nomic down­turn, as well as his re­ac­tion to na­tion­wide protests over racial in­jus­tice and po­lice bru­tal­ity against black Amer­i­cans.</p>
    <p>To counter that crit­i­cism, the con­ven­tion will fea­ture ev­ery­day Amer­i­cans who will say that Mr Trump changed their lives in pos­i­tive ways, ac­cord­ing to a mem­ber of Mr Trump’s cam­paign.</p>
    <p>The speak­ers will also sound the alarm over the dan­gers of a Bi­den vic­tory in Novem­ber.</p>
    <p>Among them will be St Louis cou­ple Mark and Pa­tri­cia McCloskey, who drew guns in front of Black Lives Mat­ter pro­test­ers who marched through their gated com­mu­nity in June.</p>
    <p>They were charged with felony weapons of­fences, which Mr Trump has called a “dis­grace”.</p>
    <p>2024 HOPE­FULS</p>
    <p>The con­ven­tion will also fea­ture Repub­li­cans con­sid­ered prospec­tive 2024 pres­i­den­tial hope­fuls.</p>
    <p>Vice-Pres­i­dent Mike Pence will be the main speaker to­mor­row.</p>
    <p>Other speak­ers in­clude Ms Nikki Haley, Mr Trump’s for­mer am­bas­sador to the United Na­tions; South Dakota Gov­er­nor Kristi Noem; Se­na­tor Tim Scott of South Carolina; Sec­re­tary of State Mike Pom­peo; and Mr Don­ald Trump Jr, who some party mem­bers want to see con­tinue the Trump legacy.</p>
    <p>The Trump cam­paign also gave speak­ing roles to mem­bers of the Se­nate and House of Rep­re­sen­ta­tives fac­ing tough re-elec­tion bat­tles, in­clud­ing Se­na­tor Joni Ernst of Iowa, Se­nate Ma­jor­ity Leader Mitch McCon­nell of Ken­tucky and Rep­re­sen­ta­tive Jeff Van Drew of New Jer­sey, who de­fected from the Demo­cratic Party.</p>
    <p>The Pres­i­dent, who trails Demo­cratic nom­i­nee Joe Bi­den in opin­ion polls ahead of the Nov 3 elec­tion, will be the cen­tral fo­cus and will speak each night... Yes­ter­day, the con­ven­tion theme was the “Land of Prom­ise”, to­day’s is “Land of Op­por­tu­nity,” to­mor­row will be fo­cused on the “Land of Heroes” and events will con­clude on Thurs­day with the “Land of Great­ness”.</p>
