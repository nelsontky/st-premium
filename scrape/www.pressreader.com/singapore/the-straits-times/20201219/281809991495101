    <p>Ja­pan ap­proved the de­vel­op­ment of two Aegis war­ships and a new type of long-range “stand-off” cruise mis­sile yes­ter­day, as se­cu­rity fears grow over Chi­nese as­sertive­ness in re­gional waters and North Korean mis­sile tech­nol­ogy.</p>
    <p>But Prime Min­is­ter Yoshi­hide Suga’s first ma­jor de­fence pol­icy de­ci­sions since tak­ing of­fice did not in­clude an ap­proval for the ac­qui­si­tion of pre-emp­tive strike ca­pa­bil­i­ties. His pre­de­ces­sor, Mr Shinzo Abe, had di­rected that a de­ci­sion be made on this by the year end in one of his fi­nal acts in of­fice.</p>
    <p>Still, this is a po­lit­i­cally sen­si­tive is­sue given Ja­pan’s war-re­nounc­ing Con­sti­tu­tion, even as ex­perts de­bate that it might be in­creas­ingly nec­es­sary for Ja­pan to take more proac­tive steps to pro­tect its ter­ri­tory amid a harsh geopo­lit­i­cal en­vi­ron­ment rather than rely on its un­pre­dictable se­cu­rity ally, the United States.</p>
    <p>Although North Korea as re­cently as in 2017 lobbed mis­siles over Hokkaido, Ja­pan has of late been cit­ing China as the big­ger se­cu­rity threat.</p>
    <p>“The se­cu­rity en­vi­ron­ment around our south-western is­lands is be­com­ing harsher as China in­creases its naval ac­tiv­i­ties,” De­fence Min­is­ter Nobuo Kishi told a news con­fer­ence yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>“In the tense sit­u­a­tion, stand-off mis­siles that can at­tack en­e­mies while se­cur­ing the safety of our troops from afar will be key to de­fend­ing our is­lands,” he said, re­fer­ring to the dis­puted East China Sea islets known as the Senkakus to Ja­pan and the Diaoyus to China.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day’s de­ci­sions came days be­fore the Cabi­net is set to de­cide on Monday a bud­get for the next fis­cal year start­ing in April. The De­fence Min­istry has asked for a record 5.49 tril­lion yen (S$70.6 bil­lion), a 3.3 per cent in­crease over the ini­tial de­fence bud­get for this fis­cal year.</p>
    <p>The de­vel­op­ment of the stand­off mis­siles is ex­pected to take five years and cost 33.5 bil­lion yen. Th­ese are ex­pected to be stealth, have a range of 1,000km and can be launched from air­craft or ships.</p>
    <p>Separately, Ja­pan will build two new Aegis war­ships that will re­place the scup­pered land ver­sion of the mis­sile de­fence sys­tem, known as the Aegis Ashore.</p>
    <p>Tokyo ditched the plan in June fol­low­ing lo­cal op­po­si­tion plus tech­ni­cal and safety is­sues that would cost too much to fix.</p>
    <p>The De­fence Min­istry said it will in­stall Aegis radar with three times the range of the older Aegis sys­tems on the two new ships, which will swell the size of the Aegis de­stroyer fleet to 10.</p>
    <p>They cost at least 500 bil­lion yen – 100 bil­lion more than the Aegis Ashore plan – and will take five years to build. But they can be more flex­i­bly de­ployed and harder to at­tack than the im­mo­bile land­based sys­tem.</p>
    <p>Still, se­cu­rity ex­perts ques­tion if the lat­est steps are enough, amid the vast ex­pan­sion of China’s de­fence bud­get and the de­vel­op­ment of its tech­nol­ogy like hy­per­sonic glide mis­siles that travel faster than the speed of sound.</p>
    <p>Dr Tosh Mi­no­hara, who chairs the Re­search In­sti­tute for Indo-Pa­cific Af­fairs think-tank, raised an­other fear: “Ja­pan’s mil­i­tary is se­verely un­der­manned. None of the hir­ing tar­gets is be­ing met.”</p>
    <p>As China will likely re­spond with weapon and bud­get up­grades, he said: “The Chi­nese can com­pletely over­whelm Ja­pan in the Sun Tzu art of war and win with­out fight­ing.”</p>
