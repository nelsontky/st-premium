    <p>Sin­ga­pore closed its worst year of eco­nomic per­for­mance on an op­ti­mistic note with the econ­omy shrink­ing less than ex­pected.</p>
    <p>Gross do­mes­tic prod­uct (GDP) con­tracted by 5.8 per cent last year amid dis­rup­tions from the pan­demic, noted Min­istry of Trade and In­dus­try (MTI) ad­vance es­ti­mates yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The full-year growth is an im­prove­ment on the MTI’s ear­lier forecast of a con­trac­tion of 6.5 per cent to 6 per cent made last Novem­ber and much lower than its pre­vi­ous es­ti­mate of a 7 per cent to 5 per cent shrink­age.</p>
    <p>While the re­ces­sion wreaked havoc across a broad swathe of the econ­omy and wiped out thou­sands of jobs, Sin­ga­pore’s suc­cess in con­tain­ing the spread of Covid-19 and the sub­se­quent lift­ing of mo­bil­ity</p>
    <p>re­stric­tions in the fi­nal two quar­ters helped al­le­vi­ate the growth slump.</p>
    <p>If reaf­firmed next month, when MTI re­leases its next eco­nomic sur­vey re­port, the record down­turn would be less than the mi­nus 6 per cent that most pri­vate fore­cast­ers, in­clud­ing those at DBS Bank and OCBC Bank, had ex­pected.</p>
    <p>The econ­omy shrank by 3.8 per cent year on year in the fi­nal three months of 2020 af­ter a re­vised 5.6 per cent drop in the third quar­ter, as more coro­n­avirus-re­lated curbs on eco­nomic ac­tiv­i­ties were lifted.</p>
    <p>Gross do­mes­tic prod­uct con­tracted by 0.2 per cent in the first quar­ter and by a his­toric 13.4 per cent in the sec­ond quar­ter.</p>
    <p>MTI’s fourth-quar­ter es­ti­mate is more pos­i­tive than the me­dian forecast of a 4.5 per­cent year-onyear drop by econ­o­mists in a Reuters poll.</p>
    <p>Mr Jeff Ng, se­nior trea­sury strate­gist at HL Bank, said the bet­ter-thanex­pected fourth-quar­ter per­for­mance re­flects Sin­ga­pore’s suc­cess in con­tain­ing Covid-19 cases, which in turn en­abled eco­nomic ac­tiv­ity to im­prove from the pre­vi­ous quar­ter.</p>
    <p>The econ­omy grew 2.1 per cent on a quar­ter-on-quar­ter sea­son­ally ad­justed ba­sis, fol­low­ing the 9.5 per cent ex­pan­sion in the third quar­ter.</p>
    <p>This was bol­stered by the phased re­sump­tion of ac­tiv­i­ties fol­low­ing the April-to-June cir­cuit breaker pe­riod and the re­bound in ma­jor economies dur­ing the quar­ter as they emerged from their l ock­downs.</p>
    <p>De­spite the bet­ter-than-ex­pected fourth-quar­ter and ful­lyear per­for­mance, MTI has main­tained its 2021 forecast for the econ­omy to ex­pand by 4 per cent to 6 per cent, helped by the low base set this year.</p>
    <p>Still, the higher end of the 2021 es­ti­mate would make it the best year since 2011, when GDP grew by 6.3 per cent.</p>
    <p>In fact, the econ­omy will prob­a­bly not re­turn to pre-Covid-19 lev­els un­til the end of this year, MTI said last Novem­ber.</p>
    <p>May­bank Kim Eng an­a­lyst Chua Hak Bin said the re­cov­ery this year will be more U-shaped than Vshaped, with GDP re­turn­ing to pr e-pan­demic lev­els only early next year.</p>
    <p>“Re­cov­ery in 2021 will be con­di­tional on ser­vices, which re­mains slug­gish, while man­u­fac­tur­ing has al­ready surged strongly in 2020,” added Dr Chua.</p>
    <p>Ms Se­lena Ling, head of trea­sury re­search and strat­egy at OCBC, agreed, say­ing there may be some mod­er­a­tion in the man­u­fac­tur­ing growth momentum in the first quar­ter, given that the pe­riod is tra­di­tion­ally slower due to the Chi­nese New Year hol­i­day.</p>
    <p>Global re­stock­ing of goods that surged in the sec­ond quar­ter has also started to sub­side, which may weigh down growth in Sin­ga­pore’s ex­port-ori­ented man­u­fac­tur­ing sec­tor, she said.</p>
    <p>Any big jump in growth num­bers may tran­spire only in the sec­ond quar­ter and that, too, would be be­cause of the very low base set in the same pe­riod of 2020, when GDP shrank by 13.4 per cent year on year, Ms Ling noted.</p>
    <p>An­a­lysts believe the re­cov­ery will also be un­even.</p>
    <p>While ef­fec­tive vac­ci­na­tion will im­prove both busi­ness and con­sumer con­fi­dence, the tim­ing of the re­open­ing of in­ter­na­tional borders re­mains key to when the whole­sale and re­tail trade, ac­com­mo­da­tion and food ser­vices and other sec­tors will re­cover, they said.</p>
    <p>Ms Ling said the mar­ket hopes for con­tin­ued fis­cal sup­port for hard­hit sec­tors like avi­a­tion, tourism and hos­pi­tal­ity-re­lated in­dus­tries in the Bud­get due on Feb 16.</p>
    <p>“But there may be greater re­cal­i­bra­tion of sup­port lev­els in or­der to pri­ori­tise repo­si­tion­ing and re­build­ing for a post-Covid en­vi­ron­ment,” she added.</p>
    <p>MTI data yes­ter­day showed that man­u­fac­tur­ing in the fourth quar­ter grew 9.5 per cent year on year, slightly less than the 10.8 per cent growth in the pre­vi­ous quar­ter.</p>
    <p>This ex­pan­sion was sup­ported pri­mar­ily by higher out­put in the elec­tron­ics, biomed­i­cal man­u­fac­tur­ing and pre­ci­sion engi­neer­ing clus­ters, which out­weighed de­clines in the trans­port engi­neer­ing and gen­eral man­u­fac­tur­ing clus­ters.</p>
    <p>How­ever, on a quar­ter-on-quar­ter sea­son­ally ad­justed ba­sis, man­u­fac­tur­ing con­tracted 2.6 per cent, a pull­back from the 12.6 per cent ex­pan­sion in the third quar­ter.</p>
    <p>Con­struc­tion shrank 28.5 per cent year on year in the fourth quar­ter, but this is an im­prove­ment on the 46.2 per cent con­trac­tion in the pre­ced­ing quar­ter.</p>
    <p>The im­proved per­for­mance came on the back of the re­sump­tion of more con­struc­tion ac­tiv­ity in the fourth quar­ter than in the third, the MTI said.</p>
    <p>The whole­sale and re­tail trade, trans­port and stor­age sec­tors shrank by 11 per cent in the fourth quar­ter, mod­er­at­ing slightly from the 11.9 per cent con­trac­tion in the pre­vi­ous three months.</p>
