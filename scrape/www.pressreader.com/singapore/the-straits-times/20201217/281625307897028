    <p>Most peo­ple in Sin­ga­pore have been dis­ci­plined in the fight against Covid-19 by ob­serv­ing safe dis­tanc­ing mea­sures and adapt­ing to changes amid the new nor­mal.</p>
    <p>But an un­der­ground ac­tiv­ity ap­pears to have taken root in some places, with safe dis­tanc­ing ig­nored and cau­tion thrown to the wind.</p>
    <p>Be­hind shut­tered shop fronts in Golden Mile Com­plex, il­le­gal gath­er­ings of large groups par­ty­ing have al­legedly been go­ing on since June.</p>
    <p>On Tues­day, Shin Min Daily News re­ported on a party where about 30 peo­ple were crammed into a small bar on the sec­ond storey of the com­plex on Mon­day.</p>
    <p>The Chi­nese-lan­guage news­pa­per said a 50-year-old woman had thrown the party to cel­e­brate her boyfriend’s birth­day, with at­ten­dees in­vited by word of mouth.</p>
    <p>NO SAFETY MEA­SURES</p>
    <p>The bar re­port­edly did not im­ple­ment SafeEn­try or tem­per­a­ture tak­ing, and cus­tomers were al­lowed to min­gle freely with­out masks.</p>
    <p>Scan­tily clad women were seen on a makeshift dance floor with loud mu­sic, while pa­trons drank al­co­hol and so­cialised.</p>
    <p>A source told Shin Min that sev­eral bars and pubs in Golden Mile Com­plex have been op­er­at­ing il­le­gally in such a man­ner since June.</p>
    <p>“If you come on week­ends, you’ll see the bars here filled with peo­ple com­pletely ig­nor­ing the pan­demic,” said the un­named source.</p>
    <p>“When the author­i­ties show up, the op­er­a­tors will just pull down the shut­ters and con­tinue op­er­at­ing il­le­gally af­ter­wards.”</p>
    <p>At least eight such bars in the com­plex were packed with peo­ple on Mon­day night, Shin Min re­ported.</p>
    <p>The po­lice have car­ried out raids in the strata mall and ar­rested peo­ple for al­legedly flout­ing safe dis­tanc­ing mea­sures. In Au­gust, six men and four women were fined be­tween $4,000 and $8,000 for breach­ing Covid-19 mea­sures by hav­ing an il­le­gal so­cial gath­er­ing in a shop unit at Golden Mile Tower.</p>
    <p>Last month, 30 women were ar­rested af­ter po­lice raids at Golden Mile Com­plex and other places. Eight of them were in­ves­ti­gated for breach­ing safe dis­tanc­ing rules.</p>
    <p>Mr Joseph Ong, pres­i­dent of the Sin­ga­pore Nightlife Busi­ness As­so­ci­a­tion (SNBA), told The New Pa­per he had heard of il­le­gal par­ties be­ing or­gan­ised by er­rant nightlife op­er­a­tors but thought they were iso­lated in­ci­dents. “I did not know they were so bla­tant at Golden Mile. It seems like the place has be­come some­thing of a hive,” he said.</p>
    <p>He urged op­er­a­tors to ap­proach SNBA to work out a so­lu­tion to help their busi­nesses in­stead of flout­ing rules and putting the com­mu­nity at risk. “It took us so long to get to phase three, with all the nightlife busi­nesses pulling to­gether.”</p>
    <p>He added: “It would be such a waste if this small group of op­er­a­tors de­stroys the hard work done by the 2,000-plus nightlife out­lets for al­most a year.</p>
    <p>“Op­er­at­ing in an il­le­gal, un­der­ground man­ner is def­i­nitely not right and it is risky for the pub­lic.”</p>
    <p>In May, South Korea had a huge out­break orig­i­nat­ing from a night­club in Itae­won in Seoul. The clus­ter saw over 200 linked cases and thou­sands need­ing to be tested.</p>
    <p>Stress­ing that ac­tion must be taken to pre­vent a sim­i­lar sit­u­a­tion here, Mr Ong said: “The penal­ties must be se­vere for those in­volved.”</p>
    <p>Any­one con­victed of breach­ing safe dis­tanc­ing rules can be fined up to $10,000 and/or jailed for up to six months. The penal­ties can be dou­bled for re­peat of­fend­ers.</p>
