    <p>A to­tal of 28 peo­ple have died from dengue this year, amid the coun­try’s largest dengue out­break.</p>
    <p>The num­ber sur­passes the pre­vi­ous high 15 years ago, when ful­lyear dengue fa­tal­i­ties hit 25, with the dengue death tally now match­ing the num­ber of Covid-19 fa­tal­i­ties here.</p>
    <p>The Min­istry of Health said yes­ter­day that the fig­ure was ac­cu­rate as at Mon­day, and that the vic­tims were be­tween 25 and 92 years old.</p>
    <p>Of the 28 cases, 24 had worked or lived in ac­tive dengue clus­ters. A quar­ter of the deaths oc­curred over the past five weeks, since Sept 5.</p>
    <p>As at Tues­day, 176 dengue clus­ters re­mained ac­tive across the is­land. Of these, one su­per clus­ter – with 300 or more peo­ple in­fected – is still ac­tive.</p>
    <p>The clus­ter in Alju­nied and Gey­lang has had 324 cases since it emerged on May 19.</p>
    <p>This year’s dengue out­break has been the worst in Sin­ga­pore’s his­tory, with 31,338 cases re­ported in the first 41 weeks, sur­pass­ing the pre­vi­ous high of 22,170 re­ported for the whole of 2013.</p>
    <p>On Mon­day, Min­is­ter of State for Sus­tain­abil­ity and the En­vi­ron­ment Des­mond Tan said that de­spite the weekly case num­bers drop­ping sig­nif­i­cantly since the peak of 1,792 re­ported in a sin­gle week in July, Sin­ga­pore is not “out of the woods”.</p>
    <p>Some 530 cases were recorded last week, a 70 per cent fall from the July peak.</p>
    <p>How­ever, Mr Tan noted that last week’s num­ber re­mained very high, and warned that next year might see an­other bad out­break, if the new year started with a high base­line of cases.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore is still in the midst of the yearly tra­di­tional dengue peak sea­son, which usu­ally takes place be­tween May and Oc­to­ber, when the weather is warmer.</p>
    <p>Warmer weather fa­cil­i­tates faster re­pro­duc­tion of the Aedes ae­gypti mos­quito which spreads the dengue virus, in­creas­ing the chances of dengue trans­mis­sion.</p>
    <p>The Na­tional En­vi­ron­ment Agency’s Grav­i­t­rap sur­veil­lance sys­tem has also de­tected a rise in the Aedes ae­gypti mos­quito pop­u­la­tion for five con­sec­u­tive weeks now, and Mr Tan said that the rate of de­cline in weekly dengue cases has slowed over the last four weeks.</p>
    <p>To avoid a sec­ond spike in weekly in­fec­tions be­fore the end of this year, cases would have to be brought down by more than half, said Mr Tan, who is also Min­is­ter of State for Home Af­fairs.</p>
    <p>In re­sponse to ques­tions in Par­lia­ment from sev­eral MPs about this year’s dengue out­break, Min­is­ter for Sus­tain­abil­ity and the En­vi­ron­ment Grace Fu said in Au­gust that a con­flu­ence of fac­tors has con­tributed to the surge in dengue cases.</p>
    <p>The fac­tors in­cluded the preva­lence of a less com­mon dengue strain – DENV-3 – that the lo­cal pop­u­la­tion has low im­mu­nity to, more hu­man tar­gets for the fe­male Aedes ae­gypti mos­qui­toes when peo­ple stayed home dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker pe­riod, and the scal­ing back of ser­vices for clean­ing and fa­cil­i­ties main­te­nance – also dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker pe­riod.</p>
