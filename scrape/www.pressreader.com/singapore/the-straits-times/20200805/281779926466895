    <p>CHICAGO • Teach­ers at dozens of school dis­tricts protested from their cars this week over plans by some US gover­nors to re­sume in­class in­struc­tion dur­ing the coro­n­avirus pan­demic, as Ari­zona, Florida, Cal­i­for­nia and Texas saw de­clines in new cases.</p>
    <p>The teach­ers, who painted mes­sages on their cars and formed car­a­vans with other school em­ploy­ees, want in­struc­tion con­ducted on­line un­til test­ing shows that class­rooms are safe and dis­tricts hire more nurses and coun­sel­lors.</p>
    <p>The Mil­wau­kee Teach­ers’ Ed­u­ca­tion As­so­ci­a­tion, the union rep­re­sent­ing public school teach­ers statewide, posted pic­tures on Twit­ter of pro­test­ers making card­board grave­stones with mes­sages such as “Here lies a third grade stu­dent from Green Bay who caught Covid at school” and “RIP Grandma caught Covid help­ing grand­kids with home­work”.</p>
    <p>Teach­ers and school staff in Chicago, Mil­wau­kee and Philadel­phia honked their horns in car protests. De­mon­stra­tors ral­lied out­side the Los An­ge­les Cham­ber of Com­merce build­ing, and in Con­necti­cut about 400 formed a car march that went by Gov­er­nor Ned La­mont’s home.</p>
    <p>“I do not want to put my stu­dents or my­self in harm’s way. I do not want to be an ex­per­i­ment,” Chicago el­e­men­tary school teacher An­drea Parker told re­porters on Mon­day.</p>
    <p>Nearly 159,000 peo­ple have died na­tion­wide from Covid-19 since the coro­n­avirus was first iden­ti­fied in the United States in Jan­uary. Cases na­tion­ally fell for a sec­ond week in a row but rose week over week in 20 states, in­clud­ing Mis­souri, Mon­tana and Ok­la­homa.</p>
    <p>Ari­zona, Cal­i­for­nia, Florida and Texas, US states with some of the largest pop­u­la­tions, saw fewer cases and hos­pi­tal­i­sa­tions.</p>
    <p>Cal­i­for­nia Gov­er­nor Gavin New­som said that in­ten­sive care unit ad­mis­sions were also down in his state, but cau­tioned that it was too early to cel­e­brate.</p>
    <p>“This virus is not go­ing away,” he said at a daily brief­ing. “It is not go­ing to take Labour Day week­end off or Hal­loween off or the hol­i­days off. Un­til we have a vac­cine, we are go­ing to be liv­ing with this virus.”</p>
    <p>The gov­er­nor said the de­cline was not enough to merit a change in his or­der that Cal­i­for­nia schools be­gin the Au­gust term with on­line learn­ing.</p>
    <p>School re­open­ings are at the cen­tre of ne­go­ti­a­tions be­tween Democrats in Congress and the ad­min­is­tra­tion of Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump over a coro­n­avirus eco­nomic re­lief Bill. Congress last week missed a dead­line to ex­tend ben­e­fits to tens of mil­lions of job­less Amer­i­cans.</p>
    <p>With Demo­cratic can­di­date Joe Bi­den lead­ing in polls ahead of the Novem­ber pres­i­den­tial elec­tion, Mr Trump, a Repub­li­can, has made school re­open­ings part of his re­elec­tion cam­paign.</p>
    <p>“Cases up be­cause of big test­ing! Much of our coun­try is do­ing very well. Open the schools!” Mr Trump tweeted on Mon­day.</p>
    <p>While re­ported case num­bers may be linked to more test­ing, the rise in hos­pi­tal­i­sa­tions and deaths is not.</p>
    <p>States with high num­bers should con­sider re-im­pos­ing lock­down re­stric­tions, the gov­ern­ment’s top in­fec­tious dis­ease ex­pert, Dr An­thony Fauci, said in an in­ter­view with the Jour­nal of the Amer­i­can Med­i­cal As­so­ci­a­tion.</p>
    <p>But Dr Fauci said at a news con­fer­ence with Mr La­mont, the gov­er­nor of Con­necti­cut, that he favoured get­ting stu­dents back in class, cit­ing the nega­tive psy­cho­log­i­cal im­pact of keep­ing them home as well as the role schools play in feed­ing chil­dren.</p>
    <p>“The de­fault po­si­tion should be to try as best as you pos­si­bly can to open up the schools for in-per­son learn­ing,” Dr Fauci said.</p>

        <p data-role="text">Peo&#xAD;ple at a protest on Mon&#xAD;day in New York against plans to re&#xAD;open schools in the midst of the coro&#xAD;n&#xAD;avirus pan&#xAD;demic. The protest was part of a na&#xAD;tion&#xAD;wide move&#xAD;ment or&#xAD;gan&#xAD;ised by teach&#xAD;ers, stu&#xAD;dents and par&#xAD;ents. United States Pres&#xAD;i&#xAD;dent Don&#xAD;ald Trump has made school re&#xAD;open&#xAD;ings part of his re-elec&#xAD;tion cam&#xAD;paign, call&#xAD;ing in a tweet on Mon&#xAD;day for schools to open.</p>
