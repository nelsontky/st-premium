    <p>That Mr Joe Bi­den will soon oc­cupy the White House in­stead of Mr Don­ald Trump will not nec­es­sar­ily elicit sighs of re­lief in Bei­jing. How­ever dif­fer­ent</p>
    <p>Mr Bi­den might be from Mr Trump per­son­ally, the great power com­pe­ti­tion ini­ti­ated by the Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion and backed by a bi­par­ti­san con­gres­sional con­sen­sus will not only re­main on course but also likely in­ten­sify in the decades to come.</p>
    <p>Of course, noth­ing is more wor­ri­some than a military con­flict be­tween two nu­clear pow­ers, but this is not im­pos­si­ble, given ris­ing ten­sions in the Tai­wan Strait and the South China Sea.</p>
    <p>Although the Peo­ple’s</p>
    <p>Lib­er­a­tion Army’s (PLA) military strength lags be­hind that of the US military in gen­eral, in the West Pa­cific, the gap is clos­ing in China’s favour. In Novem­ber 2018, the bi­par­ti­san Na­tional De­fence</p>
    <p>Strat­egy Com­mis­sion set up by the US Congress warned that in a war with China over Tai­wan, “Amer­i­cans could face a de­ci­sive military de­feat”.</p>
    <p>Nei­ther China nor the US wants a war. Both have a few agree­ments on con­fi­dence build­ing mea­sures such as the Military Mar­itime Con­sul­ta­tive Agree­ment and the Rules of Be­hav­iour for Safety of Air and Mar­itime En­coun­ters and hot­lines both at gov­ern­men­tal and military lev­els. But the fact re­mains that ac­ci­dents can hap­pen, as with the deadly collision of a United States Navy sur­veil­lance plane with a Chi­nese fighter jet off Hainan in 2001. There have also been quite a few close en­coun­ters be­tween Amer­i­can and Chi­nese military ves­sels and air­craft, in 2001, 2009, 2013, 2014, 2015 and 2018.</p>
    <p>Could the two coun­tries pre­vent an ac­ci­dent spilling over into a con­flict nei­ther wants to see? In this re­gard, the set-up and the first round of talks of the Cri­sis Com­mu­ni­ca­tions Work­ing Group be­tween the Chi­nese Min­istry of Na­tional De­fence and US Depart­ment of De­fence in late Oc­to­ber is a move in the right di­rec­tion. It’s the first time both sides ac­knowl­edged that a cri­sis could break out be­tween them.</p>
    <p>CO­OP­ER­A­TION IN GLOBAL COM­MONS</p>
    <p>For China and the US to de­con­flict, the way for­ward is to look beyond the West­ern Pa­cific into the global com­mons where their com­mon in­ter­ests over­lap. Away from China’s near sea, the two are not at log­ger­heads and co­op­er­a­tion is en­tirely pos­si­ble.</p>
    <p>China-US co­op­er­a­tion could even help to mit­i­gate their long­stand­ing dis­agree­ments on, say, free­dom of nav­i­ga­tion. While Bei­jing op­poses the US Navy’s free­dom of nav­i­ga­tion op­er­a­tions in the South China Sea and wa­ters close to its shores, see­ing them as a threat to China’s se­cu­rity, things are dif­fer­ent in places such as the Gulf of Aden, where the two navies have joined other in­ter­na­tional navies in counter-piracy pa­trols to main­tain free­dom of nav­i­ga­tion.</p>
    <p>As 90 per cent of in­ter­na­tional trade is seaborne, China, be­ing the largest ex­porter and sec­ond-largest im­porter in the world, has vi­tal in­ter­ests in the se­cu­rity of in­ter­na­tional sea lanes, like the US.</p>
    <p>If the Chi­nese and Amer­i­can navies can co­op­er­ate suc­cess­fully in the Gulf of Aden, why not ex­tend such co­op­er­a­tion to, say, the high seas of the Gulf of Guinea and the Sulu Sea, where piracy is still ram­pant?</p>
    <p>In fact, as China goes global, it finds it­self shar­ing in­creas­ingly com­mon in­ter­ests with the US.</p>
    <p>China has said pre­vi­ously, and it bears re­peat­ing here, that it has no in­ten­tion to re­place the US as a world leader or global cop. Nor does it seek to ex­port its ide­ol­ogy or de­vel­op­ment model.</p>
    <p>Much has been made of the growth of the PLA Navy, which to­day out­num­bers the US Navy in ships and sub­marines. Its ves­sels are more than enough to solve China’s Tai­wan or South China Sea is­sues, but it is im­por­tant to note that the push to build a blue wa­ter navy is a nec­es­sary move to pro­tect China’s ubiq­ui­tous in­vest­ments, com­mer­cial as­sets and na­tion­als over­seas. It also en­ables China to shoul­der the in­ter­na­tional obli­ga­tions that are in­cum­bent upon a ma­jor power.</p>
    <p>An­other area where the PLA and the US military could co­op­er­ate is in hu­man­i­tar­ian mis­sions. Dur­ing the Obama ad­min­is­tra­tion when Mr Bi­den was vice-pres­i­dent, both coun­tries dis­cussed pro­vid­ing joint as­sis­tance to African peace­keep­ers, but the talks were scrapped af­ter Mr Trump took of­fice in 2017.</p>
    <p>There is much scope for Sino-US co­op­er­a­tion, in­clud­ing ones that seem non-military but are in­deed se­cu­rity-re­lated. For ex­am­ple, in 2014, Chi­nese and Amer­i­can sci­en­tists worked side by side in a Chi­nese lab­o­ra­tory on Ebola in Sierra Leone. The spread of Covid-19 with a death toll of over</p>
    <p>1.6 mil­lion peo­ple world­wide shows clearly how “non-tra­di­tional” threats such as pan­demics could be far more lethal than even a ma­jor war and, more im­por­tantly, why the two ma­jor pow­ers should join hands once again.</p>
    <p>WORK NEEDED IN THESE AR­EAS</p>
    <p>As the gap be­tween the Chi­nese and the US mil­i­taries shrinks, the day will come when they have to dis­cuss strate­gic equi­lib­rium.</p>
    <p>The US now wants a mul­ti­lat­eral nu­clear dis­ar­ma­ment agree­ment in­volv­ing China, the US and Rus­sia. China will not agree to this given how lop­sided the deal would likely be. Both the US and Rus­sia have over 6,000 nu­clear war­heads each. Even if the num­ber of war­heads on China’s land-based in­ter­con­ti­nen­tal bal­lis­tic mis­siles ca­pa­ble of reach­ing the United States grow to roughly 200 in the next five years, as the Pen­tagon pre­dicted in its re­port to Congress this year, such an Amer­i­can pro­posal to China sounds like a fat man invit­ing a lean man to go on a diet to­gether.</p>
    <p>On the nu­clear is­sue, would it not be bet­ter if China and the US moved to dis­cuss non-first use of nu­clear weapons, as Bei­jing has pro­posed? No-first-use won’t re­duce the over­all su­pe­ri­or­ity of the US in both nu­clear and con­ven­tional forces. Even though Bei­jing has vowed to build a “world-class military” by the mid-cen­tury, it would take the PLA an­other 30 years to come close to match­ing the US military, ac­cord­ing to Bei­jing’s own road map.</p>
    <p>But in new military do­mains such as cy­ber war­fare, space and ar­ti­fi­cial in­tel­li­gence, the gap be­tween the PLA and the US military is smaller. But for China and the US to even start talk­ing about these is­sues, the US has to lift the le­gal re­stric­tions on ex­changes with the PLA first.</p>
    <p>Since 2000, Amer­i­can laws have re­stricted ex­changes with the PLA in op­er­a­tional ar­eas for fear that they might con­trib­ute to the PLA’s war-fight­ing ca­pa­bil­i­ties and “cre­ate a na­tional se­cu­rity risk”.</p>
    <p>But the tremen­dous progress of the PLA in the last two decades demon­strates that it doesn’t nec­es­sar­ily need ex­changes with the US military to grow in strength. Ac­cord­ing to the Pen­tagon, “China is al­ready ahead of the United States in cer­tain ar­eas” such as in ship build­ing, land-based con­ven­tional bal­lis­tic and cruise mis­siles and in­te­grated air de­fence sys­tems.</p>
    <p>It would be most un­for­tu­nate if both China and the US were to slide into a new cold war. Even if the mood in Wash­ing­ton is one for big power com­pe­ti­tion, both sides must strive to avoid the con­test slid­ing into con­fronta­tion, and the way to do so is still co­op­er­a­tion, look­ing for it and en­gag­ing in it wher­ever the op­por­tu­nity arises.</p>
