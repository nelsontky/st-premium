    <p>Phys­i­cal con­certs have been put on hold dur­ing the pan­demic, but that has not put Sin­ga­pore mu­si­cians off re­leas­ing new mu­sic.</p>
    <p>Since the be­gin­ning of the year, at least a dozen home-grown acts have re­leased their de­but EPs, on stream­ing ser­vices such as Spo­tify, Ap­ple Mu­sic and Band­camp.</p>
    <p>Among them is Ben­jamin Kheng, singer and song­writer from pop band The Sam Wil­lows, who is carv­ing out a ca­reer as a solo act.</p>
    <p>The 29-year-old ad­mits to be­ing ini­tially hes­i­tant about putting out his de­but EP, A Sea That Never Stops, while the world is grap­pling with a pan­demic.</p>
    <p>“The songs were writ­ten prepan­demic, but they were a serendip­i­tous fit – many talk about find­ing com­fort in the mess and be­ing okay with be­ing not okay,” he says.</p>
    <p>Since he could not play gigs to pro­mote the EP, which was re­leased last month, he ended up hav­ing fun do­ing “silly” lyric videos, which fans can watch on YouTube.</p>
    <p>“They were a great es­cape for me dur­ing this strange time, and hope­fully they are the same for other peo­ple too,” he says.</p>
    <p>For a new band like jazz fu­sion group Naked An­drea Project, not be­ing able to play live shows has been tough. They had planned to sell CDs at a launch con­cert to re­cu­per­ate the pro­duc­tion costs of their EP, In New Light.</p>
    <p>Leader Cui Yi­hao says the EP, which fea­tures shorter ver­sions of four in­stru­men­tal works, was sup­posed to be a teaser to the con­cert.</p>
    <p>“The pan­demic flipped this process. The EP has now be­come the fi­nal prod­uct, so mar­ket­ing ef­forts went to pro­mot­ing it, rather than us­ing the EP to pro­mote the launch con­cert.”</p>
    <p>But while re­leas­ing the EP with­out a live show was not ideal, there was a ben­e­fit to putting out mu­sic while many stayed home.</p>
    <p>“The EP may have reached more au­di­ences due to peo­ple stuck at home who are bored,” says Cui.</p>
    <p>“The genre we play is niche and nor­mally wouldn’t have reached many au­di­ences out­side of the jazz cir­cle, but the in­creased con­sump­tion of dig­i­tal me­dia per­haps helped shine more light on the re­lease.”</p>
    <p>De­spite the pan­demic, at least 12 Sin­ga­pore acts have re­leased their de­but EPs Ed­dino Ab­dul Hadi Mu­sic Cor­re­spon­dent</p>
