    <p>March 21 - April 19</p>
    <p>Lis­ten care­fully – your mate, busi­ness part­ner or clos­est fam­ily mem­ber is try­ing to tell you some­thing. You have to read be­tween the lines, which is not en­tirely com­fort­able, but you can fig­ure it out.</p>
    <p>April 20 - May 20</p>
    <p>Spice up your life – things are loose enough that you can af­ford a lit­tle ex­tra ac­tion. Take a field trip, duck out of work early or find a way to ask out that new hot­tie.</p>
    <p>May 21 - June 20</p>
    <p>Your in­tel­lec­tual side is mak­ing it­self heard and not a mo­ment too soon. Things are look­ing good for you, but in this con­flict that is com­ing up, you still need to work at it.</p>
    <p>June 21 - July 22</p>
    <p>Your new­est project needs more at­ten­tion than you may have thought at first, so make sure to give it your all.</p>
    <p>That al­most cer­tainly means you have to say no to some­thing new.</p>
    <p>July 23 - Aug 22</p>
    <p>Your sweet side is out in force and your loved one wants to take you out tonight. If there is no ro­man­tic part­ner at the mo­ment, it just means you are on the edge of some­thing new and won­der­ful.</p>
    <p>Aug 23 - Sept 22</p>
    <p>Im­pulse pur­chases are bad news for you and your peo­ple. You may not be able to con­trol their spend­ing habits, but you can at least of­fer good ad­vice and hope for the best.</p>
    <p>Sept 23 - Oct 22</p>
    <p>Your eye for beauty is mak­ing life a lit­tle sweeter for you, your col­leagues, your fam­ily and any­one else caught up in your cir­cle. It is a good time to help oth­ers make their own lives sweeter.</p>
    <p>Oct 23 - Nov 21</p>
    <p>You need to stay aware of your sur­round­ings – oth­er­wise, things are likely to get weird re­ally fast. One per­son in par­tic­u­lar needs mon­i­tor­ing, so keep an eye on him or her through­out the day.</p>
    <p>Nov 22 - Dec 21</p>
    <p>A le­gal is­sue may have you ques­tion­ing a few things, but you should be able to work your way past it with­out too much trou­ble. Just try to make sure you are tak­ing it se­ri­ously.</p>
    <p>Dec 22 - Jan 19</p>
    <p>Your amaz­ing new job, project or even ca­reer search is en­er­gis­ing you and keep­ing you on track, so make the most of this. You should be able to make great progress in just 24 hours.</p>
    <p>Jan 20 - Feb 18</p>
    <p>Try to con­nect with some­one new – your en­ergy is per­fect for bridg­ing so­cial gaps and ex­pand­ing your so­cial cir­cles so that you get fresh in­put. That is a goal well worth reach­ing.</p>
    <p>Feb 19 - March 20</p>
    <p>Your lat­est ideas re­quire you to make a choice – so make sure you have all the in­for­ma­tion you need and can act on it quickly, if need be. Your peo­ple are there for you, so call on them.</p>
