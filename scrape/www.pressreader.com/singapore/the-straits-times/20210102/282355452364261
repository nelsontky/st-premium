    <p>All 191 units in Gey­lang Lorong 3 have been va­cated and own­er­ship of the 60-year lease­hold land has re­turned to the state, said the Sin­ga­pore Land Au­thor­ity (SLA) yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>In June 2017, the statu­tory board an­nounced that the land oc­cu­pied by the 191 ter­race units would re­turn to the state when the leases ex­pired on Thurs­day. This is the first time a res­i­den­tial plot of land in in­de­pen­dent Sin­ga­pore has reached the end of its lease.</p>
    <p>The land is slated for a new public hous­ing de­vel­op­ment as part of plans to re­ju­ve­nate Kal­lang, SLA said.</p>
    <p>Forty of the units were owner-oc­cu­pied.</p>
    <p>The land au­thor­ity said the Govern­ment had as­sisted the own­ers over the past three years with their re­lo­ca­tion, and an SLA of­fi­cer was as­signed to each house­hold.</p>
    <p>SLA also worked with the Hous­ing Board to help the owner-oc­cu­piers find al­ter­na­tive hous­ing.</p>
    <p>All the own­ers have found al­ter­na­tive hous­ing, with some mov­ing in with fam­ily mem­bers or pur</p>
    <p>chas­ing new flats.</p>
    <p>They in­cluded the re­main­ing five own­ers who were con­sid­er­ing hous­ing op­tions on Dec 3.</p>
    <p>For the 135 units used for for­eign work­ers’ ac­com­mo­da­tion, SLA and the Min­istry of Man­power worked with the em­ploy­ers to relo</p>
    <p>cate all the work­ers.</p>
    <p>On the 16 units used for religious pur­poses, SLA said that it worked with the Min­istry of Cul­ture, Com­mu­nity and Youth as well as the rel­e­vant religious or­gan­i­sa­tions to as­sist the oc­cu­pants.</p>
    <p>The oc­cu­pants were also in</p>
    <p>formed by SLA to seek as­sis­tance from rel­e­vant mem­ber or­gan­i­sa­tions of the Na­tional Steer­ing Com­mit­tee on Ra­cial and Religious Har­mony.</p>
    <p>SLA will “clear the site in prepa­ra­tion for re­de­vel­op­ment”, added the statu­tory board.</p>
    <p>Pri­vate houses in Jalan Chempaka Kun­ing and Jalan Chempaka Puteh, near Tanah Merah MRT sta­tion, are next in line to reach their 70-year-old lease­hold ex­piry in 2034.</p>
