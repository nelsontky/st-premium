    <p>In the last two years, home-grown singer-com­poser Dick Lee has been ap­proached by about 10 women claim­ing they fell vic­tim – or nearly did – to on­line love scams in which his pic­tures were used.</p>
    <p>One of them is a Hong Kong res­i­dent, who wants to be known only as Anita. Over two months, a man, who gave his name as “Alex Cheng”, led her to be­lieve he was her long-dis­tance In­ter­net boyfriend from Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>She was re­galed with de­tailed sto­ries of his life, sweet noth­ings and even pho­tos of Lee, which turned out to be doc­tored. He also cooked up a story of fi­nan­cial woes and con­vinced her to give him €5,000 (S$8,000).</p>
    <p>It was not un­til he asked her for a sec­ond sum of €16,000 that Anita, who is in her late 40s, got spooked.</p>
    <p>She told a Sin­ga­porean rel­a­tive about him, who then pointed out that “Alex” likely stole pho­tos from Lee’s so­cial me­dia ac­counts and doc­tored them.</p>
    <p>That was when Anita, who de­clined to re­veal more de­tails about her iden­tity, re­alised she had been a vic­tim of a love scam. “Alex” also con­fessed to it when she con­fronted him.</p>
    <p>The mar­ried woman tells The Straits Times over the tele­phone from Hong Kong that “Alex” had ap­proached her on Face­book in July.</p>
    <p>In screen­shots of his pro­file that she showed to ST, he claimed to live in Sin­ga­pore and have stud­ied at the Na­tional Univer­sity of Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>He told Anita he was 55 and divorced with a daugh­ter study­ing in Canada. He also told her that he lived in Chiltern Drive in Sin­ga­pore and that he worked at en­ergy com­pany Rep­sol as a chief en­gi­neer.</p>
    <p>When she asked to call or Face­Time him, he de­clined, say­ing he was work­ing on an oil rig in Italy and that it would be dan­ger­ous to use his mo­bile phone. Ac­cord­ing to var­i­ous news re­ports around the world, the oil rig story is a com­mon one used in love scams.</p>
    <p>De­spite her reser­va­tions, Anita, who says she was go­ing through a rough patch in her mar­riage, was charmed.</p>
    <p>In their text mes­sages, which she shared with ST, “Alex” of­ten re­ferred to her as his “wife”. He even sent her Chi­nese songs – such as Can­topop star Jacky Cheung’s Ev­ery­day I Love You More (1991) – which he said rep­re­sented his love for her.</p>
    <p>“He said a lot of sweet things and made a lot of prom­ises. I al­most got a di­vorce. He won my heart – and my money,” she says.</p>
    <p>“Alex” asked her for €5,000 a few weeks after their first chat, claim­ing that an ac­ci­dent on the rig re­quired him to make com­pen­sa­tion out of his pocket. He told Anita to wire the money to Italy.</p>
    <p>She says: “I’m not stupid. I gave him al­ter­na­tive so­lu­tions – like ap­proach­ing the Sin­ga­pore con­sulate in Hong Kong – be­cause I wasn’t com­fort­able send­ing the money this way.</p>
    <p>“But he al­ways had so many rea­sons and ex­cuses. He was pa­tient too. He waited a week be­fore ask­ing for the money again. And his story was so de­tailed.”</p>
    <p>He also claimed his daugh­ter in Canada could not pay her school fees on time. Some­one claim­ing to be his daugh­ter even con­tacted Anita via e-mail and urged her to be­lieve her “father”.</p>
    <p>After Anita sent the money to Italy, a bou­quet of flow­ers was de­liv­ered to her home – a thankyou ges­ture from “Alex”.</p>
    <p>She said: “When I later re­alised it was a scam, I re­ported it to the Hong Kong po­lice. They laughed when I told them about the flow­ers. They said, ‘Usu­ally, they get their money and dis­ap­pear, but he’s still in con­tact with you and send­ing you flow­ers.’</p>
    <p>“I guess he thought I was an easy tar­get and wanted to keep up the con to get more money.”</p>
    <p>The po­lice, she adds, told her it would be dif­fi­cult to get her money back as it was sent over­seas. She then sought out Lee on so­cial me­dia to share her story.</p>
    <p>Lee, 64, tells ST: “I’ve had maybe 10 women ap­proach me over these two years to say they were vic­tims or al­most vic­tims of scam­mers who had been steal­ing from my pho­tos. I’ve re­ceived mes­sages from women all over the world – Puerto Rico, Ger­many, Hong Kong.”</p>
    <p>He be­gan notic­ing fake pro­files us­ing his pho­tos two years ago and while he tries his best to re­port them, “10 more pop up im­me­di­ately after you shut one down”.</p>
    <p>He re­counts how a woman in the Philip­pines told him she had a six-month on­line re­la­tion­ship with a man us­ing his pho­tos, who later ad­mit­ted he was a scam­mer work­ing from Nige­ria.</p>
    <p>Lee sus­pects that many of these scams are run by the same per­son or net­work, pos­si­bly from Nige­ria.</p>
    <p>With Anita’s help, he has iden­ti­fied about 130 fake Face­book pro­files us­ing his pic­tures.</p>
    <p>He says: “They use sim­i­lar names and lo­ca­tions – for ex­am­ple, a bunch of them are lo­cated in Lund, Swe­den. I also looked through my fol­lower list on In­sta­gram and re­alised I have a lot of Nige­rian fol­low­ers.”</p>
    <p>Lee showed ST a screen­shot of a mes­sage sent from an ac­count us­ing his pic­ture on its pro­file, with the In­sta­gram han­dle choulee64, which is no longer avail­able.</p>
    <p>The sender said he would stop con­duct­ing love scams with Lee’s pic­tures if he sent him money for his ed­u­ca­tion. Lee did not ac­cede to the re­quest.</p>
    <p>When Anita con­fronted “Alex” with pic­tures of Lee, he ad­mit­ted to scam­ming her. “He told me all his feel­ings were real,” she says with a laugh. “Of course I won’t be­lieve him any­more.”</p>
    <p>She now ded­i­cates her time to root­ing out fake pro­files with Lee’s pic­ture and has found other women in the same plight, whom she has re­ferred to Lee.</p>
    <p>She says: “I ap­proached Dick be­cause I wanted to share my story with him and he should be alerted to these fake pro­files since they are us­ing his pic­tures. I want to re­move these fake pro­files with his help. I know I’m not the only vic­tim and I want to at­tack this cy­ber love-scam group with him.”</p>
