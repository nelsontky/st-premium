    <p>JERUSALEM • Is­raelis re­acted with anger and dis­may yes­ter­day at an im­mi­nent na­tion­wide lock­down aimed at curb­ing one of the world’s high­est coro­n­avirus in­fec­tion rates.</p>
    <p>“It’s un­fair!” lamented seam­stress Eti Avishai, 64, hours after Prime Min­is­ter Ben­jamin Ne­tanyahu an­nounced that a three-week lock­down would start on Fri­day.</p>
    <p>“They didn’t stop the big gath­er­ings in syn­a­gogues, the wed­dings and the other events, and now I can’t be with my chil­dren and grand­chil­dren dur­ing the hol­i­days?” she added.</p>
    <p>The shut­down will be im­ple­mented hours be­fore the start of the Jewish New Year and the High Hol­i­days, which also in­clude the</p>
    <p>Day of Atone­ment and Sukkot.</p>
    <p>While Is­raelis largely ac­cepted the strict lock­down im­posed at the on­set of the pan­demic in March, this time many are frus­trated at the way the health crisis has been han­dled since busi­nesses and schools re­opened in May.</p>
    <p>“In­stead of en­forc­ing the rules in a strict way and sys­tem­at­i­cally pun­ish­ing those not wear­ing masks or who or­gan­ised gath­er­ings of hun­dreds of peo­ple, they are pun­ish­ing us all col­lec­tively,” said Mr Barak Yeivin, 56, di­rec­tor of the Jerusalem Con­ser­va­tory of Mu­sic and Dance.</p>
    <p>While wed­dings and other events were al­lowed over the sum­mer, there have been wide­spread re­ports of Is­raelis sur­pass­ing the lim­its on num­bers and break­ing other health reg­u­la­tions.</p>
    <p>Mr Yeivin said the sec­ond lock­down amounted to a “real dis­as­ter” for ed­u­ca­tional in­sti­tu­tions like his con­ser­va­tory since Septem­ber marks the start of the aca­demic year.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to an Agence FrancePres­se tally over the past two weeks, Is­rael is sec­ond be­hind Bahrain for the world’s high­est coro­n­avirus in­fec­tion rate.</p>
    <p>Is­rael has reg­is­tered 156,823 cases with 1,126 deaths out of a pop­u­la­tion of nine mil­lion.</p>
    <p>Of­fi­cials pressed ahead with the start of the school year ear­lier this month in all but a few places with par­tic­u­larly high in­fec­tion rates.</p>
    <p>Last week, the gov­ern­ment im­posed a cur­few in 40 high-risk towns and neigh­bour­hoods, the vast ma­jor­ity Arab or ul­tra-Ortho­dox com­mu­ni­ties.</p>
    <p>The mea­sures failed to curb the spread of the coro­n­avirus and Mr</p>
    <p>Ne­tanyahu on Sun­day warned that health of­fi­cials had “waved the red flag” over the pres­sure on hos­pi­tals.</p>
    <p>Ru­mours are al­ready spread­ing of food short­ages seen in the spring.</p>
    <p>Those who sup­port the new gov­ern­ment mea­sures ar­gue that the eco­nomic im­pact will be lim­ited be­cause of the many pub­lic hol­i­days. But there are wide­spread con­cerns over the dam­age the lock­down could have on men­tal health.</p>
    <p>Ms Rivka Vaknin, 70, said she was “so de­pressed” at the thought of be­ing alone dur­ing the hol­i­days. “They could have done it be­fore. Why now dur­ing the hol­i­day sea­son?”</p>
