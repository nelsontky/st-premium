    <p>Film fans here will recog­nise Ja­panese ac­tor Hiroshi Abe from his roles in movies by renowned film-maker Hirokazu Kore-eda.</p>
    <p>The ac­tor, 56, has ap­peared in Kore-eda’s fam­ily dra­mas: Still Walk­ing (2008), I Wish (2011), and After The Storm (2016).</p>
    <p>Kore-eda’s films typ­i­cally call for longer takes and more nat­u­ral­is­tic act­ing com­pared with other projects</p>
    <p>Abe has done, which range from come­dies to crime thrillers.</p>
    <p>Speak­ing to Asian jour­nal­ists at a vir­tual press con­fer­ence last Fri­day, Abe re­veals the para­dox be­hind Kore-eda’s trade­mark nat­u­ral­ism: It is achieved only after many re­hearsals, up to 30 of them.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing these ses­sions, the wri­ter­di­rec­tor works with the ac­tors to iron out the fi­nal di­a­logue.</p>
    <p>“He keeps ad­just­ing the script as we get closer to the shoot date, so that by the time we get to the set, the ac­tors have ad­justed and it all be­comes nat­u­ral,” Abe says through a trans­la­tor.</p>
    <p>The ac­tor can now be seen in the drama, The Gar­den Of Evening Mists, which is avail­able on HBO Go now and will be broad­cast on HBO from Sept 27.</p>
    <p>The movie is adapted from the 2012 novel of the same name by Malaysian writer Tan Twan Eng, which was short­listed for the Booker Prize and won the Man Asian Lit­er­ary Prize.</p>
    <p>In the film, di­rected by Tai­wanese di­rec­tor Tom Lin, Abe is Arit­omo, a mys­te­ri­ous Ja­panese ex­pa­tri­ate liv­ing in Malaysia’s Cameron Highlands.</p>
    <p>Through him, the main char­ac­ter Yun Ling – played as a young woman by Malaysian ac­tress Lee Sin jean din mid­dle age by Tai­wanese ac­tress Sylvia Chang – comes to terms with the trauma she suf­fered dur­ing World War II when the Bri­tish colony of Malaya came un­der Ja­panese oc­cu­pa­tion.</p>
    <p>Un­like Ja­panese ac­tors who ap­pear reg­u­larly in in­ter­na­tional pro­duc­tions, such as Ken Watan­abe, Abe is new to such work.</p>
    <p>He joined the film be­cause di­rec­tor Lin had seen his work and ap­proached him, he says.</p>
    <p>For many in parts of Asia that came un­der Ja­panese Oc­cu­pa­tion or at­tack dur­ing World War II, the pe­riod re­mains a sen­si­tive and con­tro­ver­sial topic – es­pe­cially when it comes to the is­sue of com­fort women, the name given to lo­cal women forced into sex­ual slav­ery by the Ja­panese mil­i­tary.</p>
    <p>It is a sub­ject that forms a cru­cial plot point in the book and film.</p>
    <p>Abe says he was drawn to the pro­ject be­cause, un­like other stories about the war – which often fea­ture con­flict be­tween “good guys and bad guys” – the film takes the vic­tims’ point of view and ex­plores how they work through their suf­fer­ing.</p>
    <p>“It shows peo­ple af­fected by the war in a very di­rect way. Both Yun Ling and Arit­omo were hurt by the war,” he says.</p>
    <p>Abe adds that the film is a love story, a topic that “ev­ery­one in the world can un­der­stand and through it, I hope peo­ple can learn to be more peace­ful”.</p>
    <p>That is not to say the film, which is rated M18, does not have its tor­rid mo­ments.</p>
    <p>In one scene, which takes place in a bath, Yun Ling and Arit­omo be­come lovers. This marks a tran­si­tion for Yun Ling, after which she ac­cepts her feel­ings for Arit­omo and over­comes her an­tipa­thy towards the Ja­panese.</p>
    <p>It was a scene that ac­tress Lee faced with some trepidatio­n, says Abe. “Before the shoot, she said she... wasn’t sure what was go­ing to hap­pen in the scene.</p>
    <p>“All I could do was sup­port her char­ac­ter and let my char­ac­ter take the pain that she was feel­ing.”</p>
    <p>The Gar­den Of Evening Mists</p>
    <p>(M18, 115 min­utes) is avail­able on the HBO Go stream­ing app and will be broad­cast on the HBO chan­nel on Sept 27, at 10.25am.</p>
