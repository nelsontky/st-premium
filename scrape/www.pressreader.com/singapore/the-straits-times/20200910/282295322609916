    <p>PARIS/NEW YORK • Louis Vuit­ton owner LVMH said it would walk away from its planned US$16 bil­lion (S$22 bil­lion) takeover of United States jew­eller Tif­fany & Co., in the most high-pro­file ex­am­ple of a deal to face col­lapse amid the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>The stage is set for an ac­ri­mo­nious le­gal dis­pute as Tif­fany said it was fil­ing a law­suit against the French lux­ury goods gi­ant to force it to com­plete the deal as agreed last year. It ac­cused the group of de­lib­er­ately stalling com­ple­tion of the takeover.</p>
    <p>The deal was struck be­fore the pan­demic, which has hit the sec­tor hard and raised ques­tions about whether LVMH was over­pay­ing.</p>
    <p>The lux­ury in­dus­try is fac­ing an un­prece­dented sales slump af­ter a decade of stel­lar growth, with rev­enues ex­pected to fall by as much as 35 per cent this year.</p>
    <p>It will take un­til 2022-23 for rev­enues to re­turn to 2019 lev­els, ac­cord­ing to con­sul­tancy Bain & Co.</p>
    <p>LVMH said in a state­ment that its board had re­ceived a let­ter from the French for­eign min­istry ask­ing it to de­lay the ac­qui­si­tion of Tif­fany to be­yond Jan 6 next year, given the threat of ad­di­tional US tar­iffs against French prod­ucts.</p>
    <p>It added that Tif­fany had also asked it to post­pone the clos­ing of the deal to Dec 31 from an al­ready ex­tended dead­line of Nov 24.</p>
    <p>The com­pany said its board had de­cided to stick to the terms of the orig­i­nal merger agree­ment, which stated that the deal must be com­pleted by Nov 24.</p>
    <p>“As it stands, the Group LVMH will there­fore not be able to com­plete the ac­qui­si­tion of Tif­fany.”</p>
    <p>Tif­fany said it was su­ing LVMH in Delaware – where the US jew­eller is reg­is­tered – and seek­ing a court or­der re­quir­ing the group to abide by its con­trac­tual obli­ga­tion un­der the deal to com­plete the trans­ac­tion on the agreed terms. It said LVMH was in breach of its obli­ga­tions re­lat­ing to ob­tain­ing an­titrust clear­ance.</p>
    <p>It also re­futed LVMH’s sug­ges­tion “that it can avoid com­plet­ing the ac­qui­si­tion by claim­ing Tif­fany has un­der­gone a ma­te­rial ad­verse ef­fect or breached its obli­ga­tions un­der the merger agree­ment, or that the trans­ac­tion is in some way in­con­sis­tent with its pa­tri­otic du­ties as a French cor­po­ra­tion”.</p>
    <p>Tif­fany shares were down about 9 per cent in pre-mar­ket trad­ing in the US and LVMH was down 1.3 per cent in Paris.</p>
    <p>The agree­ment had looked in doubt since it emerged in June that LVMH boss Bernard Ar­nault was ex­plor­ing ways to re­open price ne­go­ti­a­tions with Tif­fany due to the pan­demic, ac­cord­ing to sources with knowl­edge of the mat­ter. Those sources said later that the group had de­cided against de­mand­ing a lower price, and LVMH has re­peat­edly said it was com­mit­ted to the deal.</p>
    <p>But an ini­tial Aug 24 dead­line was pushed back by three months as the deal had not yet been cleared by the Euro­pean Com­mis­sion and other an­titrust au­thor­i­ties.</p>
    <p>When it struck the deal, LVMH was bet­ting it could re­store the lus­tre of Tif­fany by in­vest­ing in spruced-up stores and new col­lec­tions. But the US jew­eller’s world­wide sales fell 29 per cent to US$747.1 mil­lion in the three months to end-July, even though it flagged a re­cov­ery last month.</p>
    <p>The tur­moil in the lux­ury mar­ket since the coro­n­avirus spread had prompted spec­u­la­tion that LVMH would seek a lower price.</p>
    <p>“It’s a great way out for LVMH,” said Lom­bard Forte Se­cu­ri­ties trader Keith Tem­per­ton. “It’s not sur­pris­ing, their ef­forts to wrig­gle out of it.”</p>
