    <p>•</p>
    <p>LOS AN­GE­LES Hit su­per­hero movie Black Pan­ther (2018) ac­tor Michael B. Jor­dan was named Peo­ple mag­a­zine’s “sex­i­est man alive” on Tues­day, the third black ac­tor in a row to be so feted.</p>
    <p>Jor­dan, 33, said the ti­tle gave him “a cool feel­ing”.</p>
    <p>“It’s a good club to be part of,” he told the mag­a­zine.</p>
    <p>He be­gan his ca­reer as a child ac­tor in tele­vi­sion shows such as All My Chil­dren (1970 to 2011) and rose steadily through the ranks i n Hol­ly­wood un­til a break­out per­for­mance in the 2013 social jus­tice drama Fruit­vale Sta­tion. In 2015, he starred in the Rocky (1976) box­ing se­quel Creed and, three years later, he played vil­lain Erik Kill­mon­ger op­po­site the late Chad­wick Bose­man in Black Pan­ther.</p>
    <p>The an­nounce­ment was made on the talk show Jimmy Kim­mel Live!, and Jor­dan fol­lows singer John Leg­end and Bri­tish ac­tor Idris Elba, who were named “sex­i­est man alive” last year and 2018 re­spec­tively.</p>
    <p>Jor­dan ap­pears on the cover of the Peo­ple mag­a­zine dou­ble is­sue ap­pear­ing on news­stands to­mor­row.</p>
    <p>He has been vo­cal in call­ing for greater di­ver­sity in Hol­ly­wood. His pro­duc­tion company in 2018 was the first to pub­licly adopt in­clu­sion rid­ers, which stip­u­late that a film em­ploys a di­verse cast and crew.</p>
    <p>Ear­lier this year, at the height of the Black Lives Mat­ter protests against racial in­jus­tice, he teamed up with non-profit or­gan­i­sa­tion Colour of Change and launched an ini­tia­tive out­lin­ing con­crete ways in which Hol­ly­wood could in­vest in black sto­ries and anti-racist con­tent.</p>
    <p>The bach­e­lor said the women in his fam­ily are proud of his ac­co­lade.</p>
    <p>“When my grand­mother was alive, it was something that she col­lected, and then my mum nat­u­rally reads it a lot and my aunts as well.</p>
    <p>“This is one that they’re def­i­nitely going to have a spe­cial place for,” he told Peo­ple mag­a­zine.</p>
