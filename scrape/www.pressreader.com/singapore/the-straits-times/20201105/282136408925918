    <p>A Public De­fend­ers’ Of­fice could be set up by the Gov­ern­ment to pro­vide le­gal help for those fac­ing crim­i­nal charges in Sin­ga­pore but are un­able to en­gage their own lawyers.</p>
    <p>It is a pro­posal be­ing con­sid­ered in the re­view of the Crim­i­nal Le­gal Aid Scheme (CLAS), which was en­hanced in 2015, Law and Home Af­fairs Min­is­ter K. Shan­mugam told the House yes­ter­day. The re­view started last year.</p>
    <p>The details and fea­si­bil­ity of such an of­fice will be fur­ther stud­ied by the Gov­ern­ment to­gether with the Law So­ci­ety and Crim­i­nal Bar, he said, adding that the Min­istry of Law is in favour of it.</p>
    <p>But such a scheme is not with­out chal­lenges, he noted, cit­ing ex­am­ples faced by sim­i­lar schemes over­seas.</p>
    <p>Mr Shan­mugam ex­plained that hav­ing a Public De­fend­ers’ Of­fice means the Gov­ern­ment pays for the lawyers and em­ploys them in a sep­a­rate struc­ture, to de­fend the ac­cused in crim­i­nal cases.</p>
    <p>“How many of­fi­cers, how big, how much, are con­ver­sa­tions we have to have with the Min­istry of Fi­nance (MOF), among oth­ers. But in prin­ci­ple, we have to first dis­cuss it with the pro­fes­sion, and then talk to MOF and deal with the is­sue.</p>
    <p>“In prin­ci­ple, our ap­proach, I think, might have to go down that route, and we are, at least my min­istry – Min­istry of Law – in favour of this ap­proach,” he said.</p>
    <p>The min­is­ter was re­spond­ing to Ms Car­rie Tan (Nee Soon GRC) dur­ing his min­is­te­rial state­ment on the Parti Liyani case. Ms Tan had asked about im­ple­ment­ing such a scheme.</p>
    <p>Ms Parti, who worked for the fam­ily of for­mer Changi Air­port Group chair­man Liew Mun Leong, was sen­tenced to jail last year for steal­ing from the fam­ily. She suc­cess­fully ap­pealed against her con­vic­tion, and her ac­quit­tal prompted ques­tions about the crim­i­nal jus­tice sys­tem’s treat­ment of peo­ple who are less welloff.</p>
    <p>Mr Shan­mugam also ad­dressed ques­tions from Mr Zhulka­r­nain Ab­dul Rahim (Chua Chu Kang GRC) and Progress Sin­ga­pore Party Non-Con­stituency MP Leong Mun Wai on in­creas­ing di­rect le­gal aid to those who can­not af­ford to get their own lawyers.</p>
    <p>He said there is a frame­work and assess­ment process in place for the CLAS, which was ini­ti­ated in 1985 by the late Se­nior Coun­sel Harry Elias and is ad­min­is­tered by the Law So­ci­ety’s Pro Bono Ser­vices.</p>
    <p>Means and merit tests are ap­plied for each case to en­sure that fund­ing is tar­geted and al­lo­cated to vul­ner­a­ble ap­pli­cants who gen­uinely need help.</p>
    <p>The Gov­ern­ment pays 75 per cent of CLAS’ op­er­at­ing costs, in­clud­ing staff salaries and over­head costs, with the re­main­ing 25 per cent funded through pri­vate do­na­tions and the Law So­ci­ety.</p>
    <p>Mr Shan­mugam added that the hon­o­raria paid to the lawyers are “ex­tremely nom­i­nal”, so their ser­vices are ef­fec­tively pro bono.</p>
    <p>To de­cide if Sin­ga­pore’s model – of the Gov­ern­ment and pri­vate sec­tor jointly fund­ing such le­gal aid – should be changed to one of full gov­ern­ment fund­ing, he cited some over­seas sit­u­a­tions.</p>
    <p>For ex­am­ple, the fully gov­ern­ment-funded crim­i­nal le­gal aid scheme in Eng­land and Wales has drawn much public de­bate and out­cry owing to abuse and es­ca­lat­ing gov­ern­ment cost, and un­hap­pi­ness over the large le­gal aid fees.</p>
    <p>Hong Kong has also ex­pe­ri­enced grow­ing le­gal aid bud­gets owing to yearly in­creases in lawyers’ fees.</p>
    <p>“You must note, once you make le­gal aid a re­quire­ment, you can’t pro­ceed with the case un­til you find a lawyer who is will­ing to han­dle it for the fees pro­posed,” said the min­is­ter.</p>
    <p>While Ms Parti was rep­re­sented by lawyer Anil Balchan­dani pro bono, the de­fence coun­sel es­ti­mated that if full fees were charged, it could have cost $150,000.</p>
    <p>Mr Shan­mugam noted that if crim­i­nal le­gal aid was set as a re­quire­ment, then tax­pay­ers would have to pay that amount.</p>
    <p>Re­spond­ing to Mr Leong’s ques­tion on whether lawyers un­der CLAS can re­ceive a higher hon­o­rar­ium, Mr Shan­mugam said: “My pref­er­ence is to keep the pro bono spirit. A mix of lawyers em­ployed specif­i­cally by CLAS... with lawyers from pri­vate sec­tor com­ing in.”</p>
    <p>He added that “we are also not com­pletely sat­is­fied with the cur­rent model”.</p>
    <p>He fur­ther said that when it was an­nounced in 2014 that CLAS was to be en­hanced, some lawyers were con­cerned it would eat into their rice bowl. But he ex­plained to them that the tar­get group was those who could not have gone to them any­way.</p>
    <p>He added that dis­cus­sions are on­go­ing with the Law So­ci­ety, which is sup­port­ive of ex­pand­ing crim­i­nal le­gal aid but has ex­pressed strong con­cerns on the im­pact on paid work, es­pe­cially for small law firms.</p>
    <p>Like­wise, dis­cus­sions are on­go­ing with the Crim­i­nal Bar, which has counter-pro­posed ex­pand­ing the cov­er­age of of­fences in­stead.</p>
