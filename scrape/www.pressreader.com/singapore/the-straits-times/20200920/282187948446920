    <p>We are all mask ex­perts now. It has been five months since masks be­came manda­tory for every­one when they are out­doors and by now, our draw­ers are prob­a­bly stuffed with masks tried once then tossed away.</p>
    <p>While many are happy with dis­pos­able sur­gi­cal masks, oth­ers might pre­fer a cheap wash­able and reusable one, for a num­ber of rea­sons – they are kinder to the en­vi­ron­ment, more com­fort­able to wear and come in a va­ri­ety of colours and de­signs.</p>
    <p>Three months ago, The Sun­day Times put fab­ric masks from five lo­cal brands to the test.</p>
    <p>This time, I am test­ing free masks given out in dis­tri­bu­tion ex­er­cises and also the kind you might find sold ev­ery­where for un­der $10.</p>
    <p>The only ex­cep­tion: A 3M one, which cost $14.50 each from Lazada, which I bought be­cause it was a rep­utable brand.</p>
    <p>In a new re­port pub­lished by the Cen­ters For Dis­ease Con­trol and Preven­tion, based in the United States, it is said that cloth masks are use­ful in con­trol­ling the spread of in­fec­tion. “In com­mu­nity set­tings, cloth masks may be used to pre­vent com­mu­nity spread of in­fec­tions by sick or asymp­tomat­i­cally in­fected per­sons, and the pub­lic should be ed­u­cated about their cor­rect use,” it said.</p>
    <p>As my test showed, price does not trans­late into com­fort.</p>
    <p>Un­less in­di­cated, all masks were bought via Lazada.</p>
    <p>A caveat: While ev­ery at­tempt was made to be fair and strin­gent, the tests are home­made and by no means meet in­dus­try stan­dards nor can they be con­sid­ered sci­en­tific. The goal was to cover brands and types that do not usu­ally get the at­ten­tion of stan­dards bod­ies.</p>
