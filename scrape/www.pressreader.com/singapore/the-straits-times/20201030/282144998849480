    <p>Any­one seek­ing a quick les­son in swiftly shift­ing weight in global af­fairs needs only look at this week’s share sale by Ant Fi­nan­cial, which op­er­ates the Ali­pay plat­form.</p>
    <p>Not only was the is­sue sub­scribed more than 284 times, draw­ing world­wide in­ter­est, in­clud­ing from Sin­ga­pore’s wealth funds, it has placed the Chi­nese fin­tech firm, a prod­uct of this cen­tury, at a val­u­a­tion be­tween US$313 bil­lion and US$320 bil­lion (S$436 bil­lion). That is higher than that of JP­Mor­gan Chase, the largest Amer­i­can bank, whose roots go back to 1877.</p>
    <p>In­deed, ar­rangers of the share sale in­cluded JP­Mor­gan Chase it­self and Citi, icons of Amer­i­can cap­i­tal­ism and global fi­nance.</p>
    <p>As Mr Jack Ma, the bil­lion­aire founder of Ant Fi­nan­cial, told the Bund Sum­mit in Shang­hai last week­end: “This was the first time such a big list­ing, the largest in hu­man his­tory, was priced out­side New York City. We wouldn’t have dared to think about it five years or even three years ago.”</p>
    <p>The World Eco­nomic Out­look re­leased by the In­ter­na­tional Mon­e­tary Fund (IMF) ear­lier this month makes the trend even more plain. Mea­sured by pur­chas­ing power par­ity, the yard­stick that it con­sid­ers the most ac­cu­rate met­ric for com­par­ing na­tional economies, China’s econ­omy is al­most a sixth larger than Amer­ica’s (US$24.2 tril­lion ver­sus the United States’ US$20.8 tril­lion).</p>
    <p>This has im­pli­ca­tions be­yond sta­tis­tics. The IMF’s bye-laws, for in­stance, say that its head­quar­ters has to be lo­cated in the metropoli­tan area of Wash­ing­ton. But, should the fund stay based in the US if that coun­try is no longer the No. 1 econ­omy, as its own re­ports say?</p>
    <p>The fund’s ar­ti­cles of agree­ment state clearly that “the prin­ci­pal of­fice of the fund shall be lo­cated in the ter­ri­tory of the mem­ber hav­ing the largest quota, and agen­cies or branch of­fices may be es­tab­lished in the ter­ri­to­ries of other mem­bers”.</p>
    <p>The cur­rent quota for­mula is a weighted av­er­age of gross do­mes­tic prod­uct size, eco­nomic open­ness, eco­nomic vari­abil­ity and the size of in­ter­na­tional re­serves. On the first and last cri­te­ria, China is ahead, and the other two are works in progress. Citi, Black­Rock and JP­Mor­gan have all been re­cently al­lowed to ex­pand their China busi­ness.</p>
    <p>It is un­likely that Bei­jing will push this in any­one’s face at the mo­ment, but there is noth­ing to pre­vent it from do­ing so five years or a decade from now.</p>
    <p>For the same rea­sons, ques­tions may well be asked on whether</p>
    <p>New York is the best place to lo­cate the United Na­tions when four of the five big­gest economies in the world – two of them ac­knowl­edged nu­clear pow­ers and a third within easy reach of that sta­tus – are go­ing to be Asian be­fore too long.</p>
    <p>Asia and the world need to pre­pare for this new re­al­ity.</p>
    <p>If the trend was in­ex­orable, the Covid-19 pan­demic has ac­cel­er­ated it and given it im­me­di­acy, more so be­cause China is prob­a­bly the only large econ­omy that will eke out growth this year.</p>
    <p>The World Eco­nomic Out­look pre­dicts that economies in the Asia-Pa­cific re­gion will shrink 2.2 per cent this year, the most se­vere con­trac­tion in years.</p>
    <p>What’s more, shifts in global growth are push­ing China even more to the fore­front. The pro­por­tion of world­wide growth com­ing from China is ex­pected to in­crease al­most a full per­cent­age point – from 26.8 per cent next year to 27.7 per cent in 2025 – ac­cord­ing to Bloomberg cal­cu­la­tions us­ing IMF data.</p>
    <p>It is against this back­ground that the Lowy In­sti­tute’s re­cent pub­li­ca­tion of the 2020 Asia</p>
    <p>Power In­dex takes on spe­cial mean­ing.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to Lowy’s anal­y­sis, 18 states in the Indo-Pa­cific ex­pe­ri­enced sig­nif­i­cant down­ward shifts in their rel­a­tive power this year. While the US re­mains the most pow­er­ful coun­try in the re­gion, it reg­is­tered the largest fall in rel­a­tive power of any Indo-Pa­cific coun­try in 2020, while China held its ground.</p>
    <p>PAN­DEMIC AS INFLEXION POINT?</p>
    <p>Power shifts typ­i­cally take place slowly, un­less of course there is a war in which one side suf­fers a com­pre­hen­sive de­feat and the whole or­der changes for a few decades. This was what hap­pened with post-war Ger­many and Ja­pan.</p>
    <p>Re­gard­less of what West­ern commentary may say, the</p>
    <p>pan­demic may just have been that inflexion point, just as the 1956 Suez Canal cri­sis is seen to­day as a wa­ter­shed in Bri­tain’s de­cline.</p>
    <p>The Lowy study says that while the US con­tin­ues to be pre-em­i­nent, its stand­ing has waned in all but one of the eight in­dex mea­sures. A 10-point over­all lead over China two years ago was cut by half this year.</p>
    <p>The nar­row­ing power dis­par­ity sug­gests that “Wash­ing­ton, far from be­ing the undis­puted unipo­lar power, can more cor­rectly be de­scribed as the first among equals in a bipo­lar Indo-Pa­cific”.</p>
    <p>The US claims the top spot in half of the Lowy in­dex’s mea­sures of power, in­clud­ing for its mil­i­tary ca­pa­bil­ity, de­fence net­works and cul­tural in­flu­ence.</p>
    <p>There’s no deny­ing that in terms of de­fence spend­ing, it ex­ceeds China al­most by a fac­tor of three.</p>
    <p>How­ever, the US-China de­fence gap is not all that much if you fig­ure that pay and pen­sions tend to con­sume a solid chunk of de­fence bud­gets any­where.</p>
    <p>A US Navy cap­tain, for in­stance, could have av­er­age to­tal com­pen­sa­tion in ex­cess of US$170,000 at the top end, sev­eral times what his Chi­nese peer makes. The higher ticket prices of match­ing de­fence equip­ment bought by the Pen­tagon vis-a-vis China also tend to even the score con­sid­er­ably when it comes to cap­i­tal ex­pen­di­ture on weapons sys­tems.</p>
    <p>In­ter­est­ingly, Amer­i­cans are per­haps the last ones to recog­nise the shift­ing winds. Pew Re­search Cen­tre said in May that half of</p>
    <p>Amer­i­cans sur­veyed be­lieve that China’s in­ter­na­tional rep­u­ta­tion will take a hit as a re­sult of the coro­n­avirus, and less than a fifth ex­pect its in­flu­ence to grow.</p>
    <p>In­deed, the per­cent­age of Amer­i­cans who con­sider China to be the world’s lead­ing eco­nomic power ac­tu­ally shrank by 2 per­cent­age points to 30 from last year’s 32, even as there was wide­spread and in­creas­ing ac­knowl­edge­ment that Chi­nese power and in­flu­ence are a threat to the US. Sim­i­larly, about eight in 10 said they think the US is the world’s lead­ing mil­i­tary power, an in­crease from 72 per cent in 2016.</p>
    <p>As I write this col­umn, I am re­minded of the par­al­lels, echoed in the words of my friend, the late Derek Brown, who wrote this in The Guardian two decades ago of the build-up to the Suez cri­sis: “There were pow­er­ful fig­ures in the ‘es­tab­lish­ment’ – a phrase coined in the early 1950s – who could not ac­cept that Bri­tain was no longer a first-rate power. Their case, in the con­text of the times, was per­sua­sive: We had nu­clear arms, a per­ma­nent seat on the UN Se­cu­rity Coun­cil, and mil­i­tary forces in both hemi­spheres. We re­mained a trad­ing na­tion, with a vi­tal in­ter­est in the global free pas­sage of goods.”</p>
    <p>NOT A ONE-WAY JOUR­NEY</p>
    <p>To be sure, the Lowy study also finds China to have been diplo­mat­i­cally di­min­ished from the pan­demic. And there’s no deny­ing that in so many as­pects, it in­deed has a way yet to go be­fore it can catch up with the sole hy­per­power. In the past three years, the US has</p>
    <p>launched three times more satel­lites into space than China. As re­mark­able as China’s en­gi­neer­ing tal­ent is and how great its am­bi­tions for the Greater Bay Area are, it has yet to have any­thing close to a Sil­i­con Val­ley when it comes to in­no­va­tion.</p>
    <p>Agree, too, that by no means is China’s as­cent a one-way jour­ney. Its de­pen­dency ra­tio tilted seven years ago and its work­force is ex­pected to de­cline by 177 mil­lion by mid-cen­tury. That means it could yet grow old be­fore it be­comes rich. Be­sides, there are struc­tural is­sues; this month, the IMF flagged “very stretched bal­ance sheets of cor­po­rate and house­hold sec­tors” as a worry.</p>
    <p>Nev­er­the­less, and the Lowy study con­firms this, China is hold­ing its ground in over­all power. It can also af­ford to be pa­tient.</p>
    <p>As the Afghans like to say, re­gard­less of who holds the watch, time is on its side. The panic and em­bar­rass­ment of the first quar­ter of this year, when the enor­mity of the pan­demic caused by the coro­n­avirus came into view and led it to lean on its neigh­bours to keep bor­ders open to its trav­ellers, have gone.</p>
    <p>The power shift in the Indo-Pa­cific is not go­ing un­chal­lenged, need­less to say. The re­sponse may have been slow but it is gath­er­ing speed. Diplo­matic for­mu­la­tions like the Quadri­lat­eral Di­a­logue and its mil­i­tary ex­ten­sion, Ex­er­cise Mal­abar, sug­gest grow­ing push­back from key mid­dle pow­ers Ja­pan,</p>
    <p>Aus­tralia and In­dia, in al­liance with the US.</p>
    <p>WATCH­FUL NEIGH­BOURS</p>
    <p>This is caus­ing sev­eral Asian states, par­tic­u­larly in South-east Asia, to hedge their bets.</p>
    <p>Cam­bo­dian diplo­mats, for in­stance, have lately been par­tic­u­larly sen­si­tive to sug­ges­tions that their coun­try is a China proxy, in­sist­ing it is a “non-aligned” na­tion.</p>
    <p>And it wasn’t long ago that Philip­pine Pres­i­dent Ro­drigo Duterte put aside the favourable in­ter­na­tional tri­bunal rul­ing that his coun­try got on the South China Sea dis­pute with China in an at­tempt to build stronger ties with Bei­jing.</p>
    <p>In June, Manila abruptly re­versed course on plans to end the Vis­it­ing Forces Agree­ment with the US, say­ing it would wait an­other six months to de­cide. Tellingly, the Philip­pines’ Bureau of Im­mi­gra­tion this week made it a point to an­nounce that it has or­dered some 3,000 Chi­nese na­tion­als to leave, af­ter their 30-day visas given to tourists upon ar­rival lapsed. More than half of those or­dered to leave were also black­listed from en­ter­ing the Philip­pines for fail­ing to present suf­fi­cient ba­sis for their stay.</p>
    <p>In­done­sian De­fence Min­is­ter Prabowo Su­bianto has just vis­ited the US, where he was once not wel­come be­cause of al­leged links to hu­man rights vi­o­la­tions dur­ing his mil­i­tary ca­reer.</p>
    <p>Time will tell if these are boats beat­ing against a stronger cur­rent. Like it or not, China al­ready dom­i­nates in what it calls the San Hai, or Three Seas: the South</p>
    <p>China Sea, East China Sea and Yel­low Sea.</p>
    <p>More coun­tries are wait­ing to see if US re­solve is gen­uine be­fore ad­just­ing their po­si­tions. On Sun­day, US pres­i­den­tial hope­ful Joe Bi­den, who is lead­ing in the opin­ion polls, raised many an Asian eye­brow when he iden­ti­fied Rus­sia as a big­ger threat to the US than China. There’s talk that should he win, a likely pick for Trea­sury sec­re­tary would be bil­lion­aire Michael Bloomberg, a ma­jor cam­paign donor who isn’t re­flex­ively anti-China.</p>
    <p>Ja­pan, Amer­ica’s most im­por­tant Asian ally, is an­other key backer of the Quad. De­spite its war of words with China over the is­lands it calls Senkaku and China calls Diaoyu, no Ja­panese de­fence min­is­ter has even made an aerial in­spec­tion of the area in re­cent years, so as to not an­noy Bei­jing.</p>
    <p>For China, a na­tion that likely prefers to be re­spected or feared, over be­ing loved, all of these add up to its ad­van­tage. Tem­po­rary un­pop­u­lar­ity may be a price it is happy to pay. As with the Afghans, time is on its side.</p>
