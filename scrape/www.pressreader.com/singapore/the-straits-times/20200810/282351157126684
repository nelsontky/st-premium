    <p>DUBAI • Saudi Ara­bia’s state­con­trolled oil gi­ant is press­ing ahead with a plan to pay US$75 bil­lion (S$103 bil­lion) in div­i­dends this year even as profit slumped and debt surged, with the king­dom bat­tling a widen­ing bud­get deficit.</p>
    <p>Saudi Aramco, which Ap­ple re­cently de­throned as the world’s most valu­able listed com­pany, said net in­come in the three months end­ing in June was 24.6 bil­lion riyals (S$9 bil­lion), down 73 per cent from a year ear­lier.</p>
    <p>A state­ment yes­ter­day said Aramco will pay a div­i­dend of US$18.75 bil­lion for the quar­ter, most of it to the govern­ment, which owns around 98 per cent of the com­pany’s stock.</p>
    <p>“Strong head­winds from re­duced de­mand and lower oil prices are re­flected in our sec­ond-quar­ter results,” said chief ex­ec­u­tive of­fi­cer Amin Nasser.</p>
    <p>“We are see­ing a par­tial re­cov­ery in the en­ergy mar­ket as coun­tries around the world take steps to ease re­stric­tions and re­boot their economies.”</p>
    <p>The results cap a tur­bu­lent pe­riod for the big­gest oil ex­porter in the world. Prices briefly turned neg­a­tive in the United States in April as virus lock­downs battered the global econ­omy and Aramco slashed hun­dreds of jobs.</p>
    <p>Saudi Ara­bia and Rus­sia sub­se­quently led a push by Or­gan­i­sa­tion of the Petroleum Ex­port­ing Coun­tries and its part­ners to re­duce pro­duc­tion and prop up crude prices. Though they have ral­lied, Brent is still down 33 per cent this year.</p>
    <p>Ri­vals in­clud­ing BP and Royal Dutch Shell have cut their div­i­dends.</p>
    <p>Saudi Ara­bia gen­er­ates most of its rev­enue from crude, and its bud­get deficit is set to ex­ceed 12 per cent of gross do­mes­tic prod­uct this year, ac­cord­ing to the In­ter­na­tional Mon­e­tary Fund. That would be the widest since 2016, adding pressure on Aramco to main­tain div­i­dend pay­ments.</p>
    <p>Aramco’s shares rose 0.3 per cent to 33.05 riyals in Riyadh as of 12.25pm yes­ter­day. They have de­clined 6.2 per cent this year, much less than the likes of Exxon Mo­bil, which has fallen 38 per cent, and Shell, down 50 per cent.</p>
    <p>Aramco has yet to draw on a US$10 bil­lion re­volv­ing credit fa­cil­ity, Mr Nasser said. The com­pany said in June that it might is­sue more bonds or loans to meet its div­i­dend com­mit­ment.</p>
    <p>Cap­i­tal ex­pen­di­ture will be at the lower end of the US$25 bil­lion to US$30 bil­lion range it set in March, ac­cord­ing to yes­ter­day’s state­ment.</p>
