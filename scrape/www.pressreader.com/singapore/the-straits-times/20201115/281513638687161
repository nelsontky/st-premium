    <p>The need for coun­tries across the Asia-Pa­cific to co­op­er­ate in tack­ling the coro­n­avirus pandemic and the cur­rent eco­nomic cri­sis was un­der­lined by lead­ers at the East Asia Sum­mit (EAS) last night.</p>
    <p>The vir­tual meet­ing chaired by Viet­nam’s Prime Min­is­ter Nguyen Xuan Phuc also saw sev­eral lead­ers high­light the need to work to­gether to en­sure peace and sta­bil­ity as they re­build their economies.</p>
    <p>“No coun­try, no mat­ter how big, can tackle this cri­sis alone,” said Prime Min­is­ter Lee Hsien Loong.</p>
    <p>“To mount an ef­fec­tive col­lec­tive re­sponse, coun­tries big and small have to work to­gether, in a con­ducive strate­gic en­vi­ron­ment and through a re­gional ar­chi­tec­ture that fos­ters peace and sta­bil­ity.”</p>
    <p>PM Lee sug­gested three ar­eas for EAS mem­bers to boost co­op­er­a­tion: pro­mote vac­cine mul­ti­lat­er­al­ism, share tech­nol­ogy and sup­port one an­other’s eco­nomic re­cov­ery.</p>
    <p>The EAS brings to­gether Asean’s 10 mem­bers plus Aus­tralia, China, In­dia, Ja­pan, South Korea, New Zealand, Rus­sia and the United States.</p>
    <p>PM Lee noted that a work­ing vac­cine is part of the so­lu­tion to­wards a re­cov­ery, and for­tu­nately, most of the lead­ing Covid-19 vac­cine can­di­dates come from EAS mem­bers.</p>
    <p>“I hope we will all work to­gether to pro­cure an eq­ui­table, steady and af­ford­able sup­ply of treat­ments and vac­cines,” he said.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore is ready to con­trib­ute in this area, he added.</p>
    <p>It is in­vest­ing heav­ily in vac­cine re­search and de­vel­op­ment and build­ing up its man­u­fac­tur­ing ca­pac­ity to meet the re­gion’s needs.</p>
    <p>Ad­dress­ing EAS lead­ers, United Na­tions Sec­re­tary-Gen­eral An­to­nio Guter­res said the UN was work­ing to scale up the pro­duc­tion of ef­fec­tive vac­cines and ther­a­peu­tics that “must be avail­able and af­ford­able for ev­ery­one, ev­ery­where”.</p>
    <p>In his speech, PM Lee said many EAS mem­bers have adopted in­no­va­tive tech­no­log­i­cal so­lu­tions for con­tact trac­ing and im­prov­ing test­ing, and coun­tries can share these.</p>
    <p>“We should learn from one an­other’s ex­pe­ri­ences, open source the soft­ware codes wher­ever pos­si­ble, and en­cour­age in­ter­op­er­abil­ity where prac­ti­cal,” he added.</p>
    <p>He also en­cour­aged mem­bers to work to­gether to mit­i­gate the longer-term global eco­nomic im­pact of the pandemic on their peo­ple and busi­nesses.</p>
    <p>“It is crit­i­cal to up­hold a rules­based, open and in­clu­sive mul­ti­lat­eral trad­ing sys­tem,” he said.</p>
    <p>He added that the Re­gional Com­pre­hen­sive Eco­nomic Part­ner­ship, to be signed to­day, will spur business con­fi­dence and re­cov­ery through en­hanced mar­ket ac­cess, com­pre­hen­sive trade fa­cil­i­ta­tive mea­sures and ex­panded com­mit­ments in ar­eas like e-com­merce and in­tel­lec­tual prop­erty rights.</p>
    <p>The EAS has tra­di­tion­ally also dis­cussed co­op­er­a­tion in ar­eas such as counter-ter­ror­ism, cy­ber se­cu­rity and trans­bound­ary pol­lu­tion, and PM Lee said he was glad that state­ments adopted at the sum­mit showed a strong po­lit­i­cal will to ad­dress such com­mon chal­lenges.</p>
    <p>“Re­gional stake­hold­ers should con­tinue to work to­gether to main­tain peace and sta­bil­ity in the re­gion,” he added, cit­ing the South China Sea, where mar­itime dis­putes should be re­solved in ac­cor­dance with uni­ver­sally recog­nised prin­ci­ples of in­ter­na­tional law.</p>
    <p>He also wel­comed the progress made in Asean-China ne­go­ti­a­tions on a Code of Con­duct (COC) in the South China Sea, adding: “There is a lot of work ahead, and we should keep up the mo­men­tum of dis­cus­sions so that we can con­clude an ef­fec­tive and sub­stan­tive COC.”</p>
    <p>Asean lead­ers were joined at the EAS by Chi­nese Pre­mier Li Ke­qiang and Rus­sian Pres­i­dent Vladimir Putin, among oth­ers, but the US was rep­re­sented by Na­tional Se­cu­rity Ad­viser Robert O’Brien, and In­dia by Ex­ter­nal Af­fairs Min­is­ter S. Jais­hankar.</p>
    <p>No coun­try, no mat­ter how big, can tackle this cri­sis alone. To mount an ef­fec­tive col­lec­tive re­sponse, coun­tries big and small have to work to­gether, in a con­ducive strate­gic en­vi­ron­ment and through a re­gional ar­chi­tec­ture that fos­ters peace and sta­bil­ity.</p>
    <p>PRIME MIN­IS­TER LEE HSIEN LOONG</p>
    <p>The grad­ual re­sump­tion of travel will en­able eco­nomic re­cov­ery and spur con­fi­dence in busi­nesses in South-east Asia, said Prime Min­is­ter Lee Hsien Loong yes­ter­day, as he urged coun­tries to lift re­stric­tions on Asean states as the Covid-19 sit­u­a­tion sta­bilises.</p>
    <p>Speak­ing at the vir­tual 23rd Asean Plus Three (APT) Sum­mit be­tween the re­gional bloc and China, Ja­pan and South Korea, PM Lee em­pha­sised the need to re­sume es­sen­tial travel safely be­tween coun­tries.</p>
    <p>He noted that Sin­ga­pore has bi­lat­eral green lane ar­range­ments with some Asean mem­ber states and the three East Asian coun­tries to fa­cil­i­tate es­sen­tial travel.</p>
    <p>“Even­tu­ally, we look for­ward to re­sum­ing safe and smooth travel within the re­gion. This will strengthen our peo­ple-to-peo­ple ties and give our economies a much-needed boost,” he said.</p>
    <p>In sep­a­rate meet­ings with Aus­tralia and New Zealand, PM Lee said the Repub­lic has lifted bor­der re­stric­tions to al­low vis­i­tors from the two coun­tries, and hopes they will do the same soon.</p>
    <p>He added that the two coun­tries and Asean should work to­wards “pro­gres­sively and safely lift­ing travel re­stric­tions”, as the Covid-19 sit­u­a­tion sta­bilises and economies get back on track. “The re­open­ing of our bor­ders in a safe and cal­i­brated man­ner will fa­cil­i­tate the re­sump­tion of eco­nomic ac­tiv­ity, and is an im­por­tant con­fi­dence marker for our peo­ples and busi­nesses,” he said dur­ing the sec­ond Asean-Aus­tralia Bi­en­nial Sum­mit.</p>
    <p>In his speeches, PM Lee also called for co­op­er­a­tion in the de­vel­op­ment and sup­ply of Covid-19 vac­cines, and in eco­nomic re­cov­ery by up­hold­ing a rules-based sys­tem with open sup­ply chains.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing the meet­ing with China, Ja­pan and South Korea, he noted that the APT bloc’s long record of co­op­er­a­tion in pub­lic health emer­gen­cies be­gan with the Sars out­break in 2003. The three coun­tries were among the first to sup­port Asean dur­ing the Covid-19 cri­sis, con­tribut­ing more than US$60 mil­lion (S$81 mil­lion) to the Covid-19 Asean Re­sponse Fund.</p>
    <p>PM Lee said dis­cus­sions are un­der way to cre­ate an APT re­serve of es­sen­tial med­i­cal sup­plies, build­ing upon the Asean Re­gional Re­serve of Med­i­cal Sup­plies.</p>
    <p>He noted the APT’s eco­nomic min­is­ters are adopt­ing a joint state­ment and fi­nal­is­ing an ac­tion plan to ad­dress the eco­nomic fall­out from the pandemic.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, the group­ing also adopted a lead­ers’ state­ment on strength­en­ing APT co­op­er­a­tion for eco­nomic and fi­nan­cial re­silience in the face of emerg­ing chal­lenges.</p>
    <p>PM Lee noted that Sin­ga­pore, Aus­tralia and New Zealand sup­port “vac­cine mul­ti­lat­er­al­ism” and are Friends of the Co­vax Fa­cil­ity.</p>
    <p>The Co­vax or Covid-19 Vac­cine Global Ac­cess, aims to pro­vide vac­cines for the 76 coun­tries in­volved, and 92 other poorer na­tions sup­ported un­der the scheme.</p>
    <p>“We should com­ple­ment that with co­op­er­a­tion in vac­cine re­search and de­vel­op­ment, and by build­ing up our vac­cine man­u­fac­tur­ing ca­pac­i­ties to sup­port re­gional de­mand,” said PM Lee.</p>
    <p>On eco­nomic re­cov­ery, he reaf­firmed Sin­ga­pore’s com­mit­ment to abide by “a free, open and rules­based mul­ti­lat­eral trad­ing sys­tem and main­tain sup­ply chain con­nec­tiv­ity”. He cited to­day’s sign­ing of the 15-mem­ber Re­gional Com­pre­hen­sive Eco­nomic Part­ner­ship as a ma­jor step for­ward. He also called for all par­ties to press on with the Gen­eral Re­view of the Asean-Aus­tralia-New Zealand Free Trade Agree­ment (FTA), the most com­pre­hen­sive FTA Asean has con­cluded to date and which can be “a pathfinder for fu­ture FTAs”.</p>
    <p>In the APT meet­ing, PM Lee called for the use of re­gional plat­forms to boost co­op­er­a­tion, such as the Chi­ang Mai Ini­tia­tive Mul­ti­lat­er­al­i­sa­tion to im­prove mar­ket con­fi­dence and fi­nan­cial sta­bil­ity in this re­gion, and the Asean Smart Cities Net­work to dis­cuss the use of tech­nol­ogy in fight­ing Covid-19.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, Prime Min­is­ter Scott Mor­ri­son an­nounced that Aus­tralia is com­mit­ting around A$500 mil­lion (S$489.7 mil­lion) over three years to sup­port ac­cess to safe and ef­fec­tive Covid-19 vac­cines for South-east Asia and the Pa­cific.</p>
    <p>“The sup­port that this pro­vides gives us all, and par­tic­u­larly through­out the re­gion, new choices based on... the best health and sci­ence, and re­flects our shared stake in your re­cov­ery,” he said.</p>
    <p>In her meet­ing with Asean lead­ers, New Zealand Prime Min­is­ter Jacinda Ardern said: “Our part­ner­ship will play an im­por­tant role as our coun­tries work to­gether to sup­port global ef­forts to man­age the pandemic and en­sure fair and eq­ui­table ac­cess to safe vac­cines, and drive eco­nomic re­cov­ery through main­tain­ing open mar­kets for our ex­porters and re­silient sup­ply chains.”</p>
