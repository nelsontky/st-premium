    <p>It’s been a tough year for many around the world. But fi­nan­cial mar­kets, de­spite their wild swings, have proven far more re­silient.</p>
    <p>Global stocks crashed in the fastest bear mar­ket ever in late Fe­bru­ary, only to roar back in</p>
    <p>April in the fastest bull mar­ket in his­tory.</p>
    <p>The MSCI All Coun­try in­dex is now sit­ting at an all-time high and up nearly 10 per cent for the year.</p>
    <p>Be­neath the hood, how­ever, this rally has re­mained highly bi­fur­cated.</p>
    <p>In the United States, much of the gains in the S&P 500 have been pow­ered by the “Faang” – Face­book, Ap­ple, Ama­zon, Net­flix and Al­pha­bet’s Google – shares, which are up a whop­ping 82 per cent year to date.</p>
    <p>Re­gions with out­sized ex­po­sure to dis­rup­tive busi­nesses like the US and China have markedly out­per­formed those that don’t.</p>
    <p>In fact, even with the global “ro­ta­tion” from Covid-19 win­ners to eco­nom­i­cally sen­si­tive stocks last month, the old economy-ori­ented MSCI Asean in­dex is still down for the year, and two-thirds re­main un­der­wa­ter.</p>
    <p>In com­par­i­son, the tech-heavy North Asian mar­kets are still up over 25 per cent.</p>
    <p>But, as the pan­demic re­cedes, this year’s lag­gards could well turn into lead­ers next year.</p>
    <p>If in­vest­ing in 2020 was about go­ing re­silient, large and Amer­i­can; 2021 could be about go­ing cycli­cal, small and global.</p>
    <p>A YEAR OF RE­NEWAL IN 2021</p>
    <p>Com­ing off a tu­mul­tuous year, the global eco­nomic cy­cle is now poised for a pow­er­ful re­bound.</p>
    <p>Wide­spread vac­ci­na­tions should come by midyear, and with them, a faster re­turn to busi­ness ac­tiv­ity.</p>
    <p>An­chored by a dovish Fed­eral Re­serve, su­per-easy mon­e­tary pol­icy should also re­main for some time. Head­winds such as trade ten­sions and a stronger US dol­lar are also likely to dis­si­pate with the new US ad­min­is­tra­tion.</p>
    <p>The in­dus­try’s con­sen­sus now is for global gross do­mes­tic prod­uct (GDP) to surge well over 5 per cent next year, af­ter shrink­ing nearly 4 per cent this year.</p>
    <p>In Asia, too, economies are set for great leaps, in­clud­ing Sin­ga­pore, where GDP growth could top 6 per cent next year, af­ter fall­ing by a sim­i­lar mag­ni­tude this year.</p>
    <p>Like­wise, cor­po­rate earn­ings are set for sharp re­bounds across all ma­jor re­gions. Glob­ally, prof­its could rise 25 per cent, af­ter con­tract­ing 16 per cent this year.</p>
    <p>In Asia, earn­ings and free cash flows are poised to surge by over 20 per cent, and 40 per cent to 50 per cent, re­spec­tively, as de­mand is re­stored and mar­gins re­cover, which bodes well for equities and credit alike.</p>
    <p>Mar­kets are up sharply from March lows, but the ques­tion ahead is not “if” one should put more cash to work, but “how”.</p>
    <p>HOW TO IN­VEST</p>
    <p>To be sure, stocks don’t go up in a straight line and the spot news of ris­ing in­fec­tions is wor­ri­some.</p>
    <p>So, mar­kets could still see sud­den spikes in volatil­ity.</p>
    <p>A dis­ci­plined ap­proach to in­vest­ing for the longer term, as op­posed to mar­ket tim­ing, re­mains key to nav­i­gat­ing the en­vi­ron­ment ahead.</p>
    <p>In terms of strate­gies, we would look to position in se­lect ar­eas of the mar­ket that could drive the next leg up.</p>
    <p>Glob­ally, we like mar­ket lead­ers in cycli­cal sec­tors such as in­dus­tri­als, fi­nan­cials, en­ergy and con­sumer dis­cre­tionary.</p>
    <p>In ad­di­tion, the lag­gards of this year such as the UK and emerg­ing mar­ket value stocks, as well as US mid­caps and Euro­pean small-mid caps, should out­per­form mega-cap tech stocks, global con­sumer sta­ples and some of the pri­mary stay-at-home ben­e­fi­cia­ries.</p>
    <p>Closer to home, we see fur­ther mid-teens up­side for Asia ex-Japan equities. Cycli­cal tech – in par­tic­u­lar, semi­con­duc­tors and hard­ware – is in a sweet spot.</p>
    <p>We pre­fer South Korea, Sin­ga­pore and In­dia against Hong Kong, Malaysia and Thai­land.</p>
    <p>Against a back­drop of lower-for-longer rates, cash and the safest bonds are likely to de­liver neg­a­tive real re­turns.</p>
    <p>This is likely to push in­vestors to search harder for yield, di­ver­si­fy­ing into riskier ar­eas of the mar­ket.</p>
    <p>We see a num­ber of op­por­tu­ni­ties glob­ally in the credit space as a means of in­come gen­er­a­tion, in­clud­ing US dol­lar-de­nom­i­nated emerg­ing mar­ket sov­er­eign bonds, Asian high-yield credit and euro zone cross­over bonds.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, high-div­i­dend-pay­ing stocks in Asia, such as se­lect in­dus­tri­als, en­ergy and banks, should draw in­ter­est as the re­gional eco­nomic cy­cle sta­bilises.</p>
    <p>Also, the US dol­lar’s safe-haven ap­peal should con­tinue to fade as the pan­demic re­cedes.</p>
    <p>Asian cur­ren­cies, in­clud­ing the Chi­nese ren­minbi and the Sin­ga­pore dol­lar, should con­tinue to ap­pre­ci­ate against the green­back next year.</p>
    <p>STAY DI­VER­SI­FIED</p>
    <p>Of course, so much comes down to vac­cine op­ti­mism. So, while re­turns are ex­pected to be quite strong in the year ahead, stay­ing in­vested and di­ver­si­fy­ing among themes and as­sets are es­sen­tial.</p>
    <p>Trends that will out­last Covid-19, or be catal­ysed by it, should be at the top of in­vestors’ minds.</p>
    <p>The shift to the green economy is an ex­am­ple, with Japan, South Korea, the Euro­pean Union and China pledg­ing vast sums in green tech ar­eas such as elec­tric ve­hi­cles and re­new­able en­ergy as part of their post-pan­demic spend­ing plans.</p>
    <p>In terms of as­sets, gold, which has cooled off lately, re­mains a solid di­ver­si­fier for eq­uity-ori­ented in­vestors. Its fun­da­men­tal driv­ers – weak US dol­lar, neg­a­tive real US in­ter­est rates – point to a short-term price re­cov­ery ahead, and is a good hedge in the event the vac­cine time­line doesn’t pan out.</p>
    <p>We are op­ti­mistic that the Year of the Ox will live up to its bullish char­ac­ter­is­tics, but one should never leave any­thing to chance. Be­sides po­si­tion­ing for near-term gains, in­vestors should al­ways have an eye on the long-term trends while re­main­ing mind­ful of the risks.</p>
