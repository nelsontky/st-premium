    <p>Those look­ing to go for a dip at the beach can now check if the qual­ity of sea­wa­ter is safe first. The Na­tional En­vi­ron­ment Agency now pro­vides weekly as­sess­ments of the qual­ity of sea­wa­ter at nine beaches in Sin­ga­pore, along with an ad­vi­sory, based on the lev­els of en­te­ro­coc­cus bac­te­ria mea­sured in the wa­ter.</p>
    <p>Those look­ing to go for a dip at the beach can now check if the qual­ity of sea­wa­ter is safe first.</p>
    <p>The Na­tional En­vi­ron­ment Agency (NEA) now pro­vides weekly as­sess­ments of the qual­ity of sea­wa­ter at nine beaches in Sin­ga­pore, along with an ad­vi­sory, based on the lev­els of en­te­ro­coc­cus bac­te­ria mea­sured in the wa­ter.</p>
    <p>En­te­ro­coc­cus is a harm­ful bac­terium found in an­i­mal and hu­man fae­ces.</p>
    <p>Data on the qual­ity of wa­ter at beaches used to be pub­lished an­nu­ally since 2009, but this prac­tice has been stepped up to al­low beach­go­ers to have more cur­rent in­for­ma­tion to safe­guard their health, the NEA said in a state­ment yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The nine beaches are Sen­tosa’s Siloso Beach, Palawan Beach and Tan­jong Beach, Sele­tar Is­land Beach, Sem­bawang Park Beach, Changi Beach, East Coast Park Beach, Pasir Ris Beach and Pung­gol Beach.</p>
    <p>There are three bands used to mea­sure the amount of bac­te­ria in the wa­ter – nor­mal, el­e­vated and high. If the bac­te­rial level is nor­mal, it is safe to en­ter the wa­ter and beach­go­ers can con­tinue with their wa­ter ac­tiv­i­ties.</p>
    <p>When bac­te­rial lev­els are el­e­vated, chil­dren, the elderly and peo­ple with weaker im­mune sys­tems are ad­vised to re­duce pri­mary con­tact ac­tiv­i­ties which could in­crease the risk of gas­troin­testi­nal or res­pi­ra­tory ill­nesses.</p>
    <p>These are ac­tiv­i­ties where the whole body, or the face and trunk, are fre­quently im­mersed in wa­ter and it is likely that some wa­ter will be swal­lowed. Ex­am­ples of pri­mary con­tact ac­tiv­i­ties in­clude swim­ming, wa­ter ski­ing, wake­board­ing and div­ing.</p>
    <p>When bac­te­rial lev­els are high, NEA ad­vises all beach­go­ers to min­imise pri­mary con­tact ac­tiv­i­ties.</p>
    <p>As a gen­eral guide, peo­ple are ad­vised to avoid the wa­ter im­me­di­ately af­ter heavy rain­fall and to re­frain from wa­ter ac­tiv­i­ties when they have open sores, skin in­fec­tions, or when they feel un­well.</p>
    <p>NEA added that the pub­lic need not be un­duly con­cerned if bac­te­rial lev­els at cer­tain stretches of the beach are el­e­vated or high for a par­tic­u­lar week.</p>
    <p>This is be­cause bac­te­rial lev­els are tran­sient i n na­ture as the beach wa­ter is “con­tin­u­ously flushed and mixed by cur­rents”.</p>
    <p>When bac­te­rial lev­els de­te­ri­o­rate to the high range, NEA will mon­i­tor the wa­ter qual­ity closely and con­duct in­ves­ti­ga­tions to iden­tify pos­si­ble pol­lu­tion sources.</p>
    <p>Kayak guide Sim Cher Huey, 45, said these weekly up­dates will help him plan ahead when he takes young chil­dren or the elderly on kayak­ing trips. “It is im­por­tant for these read­ings to be pub­li­cised so we can pro­tect those with weaker im­mune sys­tems,” he said.</p>
    <p>Peo­ple can check the wa­ter qual­ity of beaches at the web­site https://www.nea.gov.sg/BSWI or through the myENV mo­bile app.</p>
    <p>In ad­di­tion, from Oct 17, those who want to visit Sen­tosa’s beaches dur­ing peak pe­ri­ods, in­clud­ing week­ends and pub­lic hol­i­days, will have to make reser­va­tions first.</p>
    <p>Guests may pre-book their en­try up to seven days be­fore their in­tended vis­its, sub­ject to ca­pac­ity lim­its.</p>
    <p>For its ini­tial roll-out, the reser­va­tion sys­tem will be­gin ac­cept­ing book­ings from Satur­day, for vis­its com­menc­ing on Oct 17.</p>
    <p>As a gen­eral guide, peo­ple are ad­vised to avoid the wa­ter im­me­di­ately af­ter heavy rain­fall and to re­frain from wa­ter ac­tiv­i­ties when they have open sores, skin in­fec­tions, or when they feel un­well.</p>
