    <p>Can­topop duo Twins have a pleas­ant sur­prise for their fans – they will be hold­ing a con­cert this year as they mark their 20th an­niver­sary in show busi­ness.</p>
    <p>Gil­lian Chung was at­tend­ing a pro­mo­tional ac­tiv­ity re­cently when Char­lene Choi, the other half of the duo, ap­peared via Face­time and in­ter­acted with her.</p>
    <p>They said that al­though they have been in dif­fer­ent places in re­cent years as they de­vel­oped their ca­reers, both have re­mained in touch.</p>
    <p>Chung, 39, has been act­ing mainly in China, while Choi, 38, has been act­ing in Hong Kong and has been nom­i­nated at the last two Hong Kong Film Awards for her roles in The Lady Im­proper (2019) and Fa­tal Visit (2020).</p>
    <p>Choi said at the pro­mo­tional event that she missed Chung, who replied they are like fam­ily mem­bers who can talk about any­thing with each other.</p>
    <p>At the event, Chung per­formed the Twins’ hit song Next Sta­tion, Tin Hau. The duo also an­nounced their planned 20th-an­niver­sary con­cert this year.</p>
    <p>Chung wrote later on Weibo: “Twenty years seem to have passed by in a flash. There were ups and downs on this route, but you are al­ways there to en­cour­age me.</p>
    <p>“No mat­ter where we go in the fu­ture, I will sing Next Sta­tion, Tin Hau with Char­lene Choi 20 years later.”</p>
    <p>Chung was in the news last year af­ter she sep­a­rated from her hus­band, Tai­wanese aes­thet­ics doc­tor Michael Lai, last May.</p>
    <p>She suf­fered a head in­jury last Septem­ber, af­ter an ac­ci­dent in her ho­tel room while film­ing a movie in Xi­a­men, China.</p>
    <p>Chung and Choi will be act­ing in an up­com­ing Web mys­tery drama Foren­sic JD, their first tele­vi­sion col­lab­o­ra­tion in nine years.</p>
