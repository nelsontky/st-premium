    <p>LOS AN­GE­LES • MGM Growth Prop­er­ties is will­ing to ac­quire a big Las Ve­gas Strip casino such as the Vene­tian – which Las Ve­gas Sands re­cently put on the block – if the com­pany can find the right part­ner to op­er­ate it.</p>
    <p>“We would def­i­nitely be in­ter­ested,” Mr James Ste­wart, MGM Growth’s chief ex­ec­u­tive of­fi­cer, told in­vestors on a con­fer­ence call on Mon­day. “If we can go to bed at night with­out hav­ing any­thing to keep us up over wor­ry­ing about – is the rent go­ing to get paid? – It’s ab­so­lutely a deal that we would do.”</p>
    <p>Bloomberg News re­ported last week that Sands was seek­ing at least US$6 bil­lion (S$8.2 bil­lion) for its Las Ve­gas prop­er­ties, in­clud­ing the Vene­tian, the Palazzo and the Sands con­ven­tion cen­tre. Real es­tate in­vest­ment trusts (Reits) like MGM Growth, which own casino prop­er­ties but do not typ­i­cally op­er­ate them, are seen as po­ten­tial bid­ders.</p>
    <p>Las Ve­gas has strug­gled to bounce back from the pan­demic, which has crip­pled tourism and shut­tered its con­ven­tion busi­ness. But Mr Ste­wart does not see Sands’ ef­fort to sell its Ve­gas prop­er­ties as a re­pu­di­a­tion of the city. If any­thing, get­ting US$6 bil­lion for the prop­er­ties would be a val­i­da­tion of Las Ve­gas’ po­ten­tial, he said. Sands may just pre­fer to in­vest its money else­where, such as Ma­cau and Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>Ex­ec­u­tives at Vici Prop­er­ties, another large Reit fo­cused on casino prop­er­ties, said last week that they also would po­ten­tially be in­ter­ested in a large Las Ve­gas ac­qui­si­tion.</p>
    <p>“We con­tinue to be ex­cited about this mar­ket long term,” Vici pres­i­dent John Payne said on a con­fer­ence call with in­vestors. “Clearly, Las Ve­gas has to get over not hav­ing meet­ing busi­ness right now and some in­ter­na­tional busi­ness, but we be­lieve that that will come back.”</p>
    <p>By con­trast, the third of the big three casino Reits – Gam­ing & Leisure Prop­er­ties – said last week it would likely not bid on a big Las Ve­gas as­set.</p>
    <p>“When we l ook at the Strip, when you look at the fixed costs as­so­ci­ated with the prop­er­ties and the ex­po­sure to travel and con­ven­tions, right now if we un­der­write as­sets there, it’s even harder at the same eco­nom­ics to make them pass muster,” said Mr Matt Dem­chyk, the com­pany’s se­nior vi­cepres­i­dent for in­vest­ments.</p>
    <p>“We look at ev­ery­thing and we’ll cer­tainly look, but it’s hard for the num­bers to work for us, given our ap­proach and our model,” he added.</p>
    <p>Gam­ing & Leisure, Vici and MGM Growth were all spun out of casino op­er­a­tors as the in­dus­try shifted to a model where their prop­er­ties are owned by Reits and op­er­ated by oth­ers. The ar­range­ment brings tax ad­van­tages: Reits pass along their earn­ings to in­vestors with­out pay­ing cor­po­rate in­come taxes.</p>
    <p>MGM Re­sort In­ter­na­tional, which runs casi­nos af­fil­i­ated with MGM Growth, told in­vestors last week that it was not in­ter­ested in ac­quir­ing ad­di­tional prop­er­ties on the Strip. MGM is the largest op­er­a­tor of casino re­sorts in the city. It is also the big­gest share­holder of MGM Growth, but has said it plans on re­duc­ing its stake in that busi­ness.</p>
    <p>“We think we own enough of Las Ve­gas to be open about it,” MGM Re­sorts CEO Bill Horn­buckle said. “But there will be other op­por­tu­ni­ties that the mar­ket presents to us that we’ll have to take a sin­cere look at.”</p>
