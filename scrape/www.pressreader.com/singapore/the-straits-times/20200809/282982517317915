    <p>Af­ter be­friend­ing el­derly res­i­dents liv­ing alone in her Yio Chu Kang neigh­bour­hood, house­wife Dil­jan Shaik Arif Ali found that many of them pre­fer home-cooked fare to that sold at food stalls.</p>
    <p>She started cook­ing sim­ple dishes such as rice, mixed veg­eta­bles and non-spicy curry chicken for about 10 of them al­most daily, with the ex­penses com­ing from her own pocket. She had been do­ing this for about two years, be­fore the two-month cir­cuit breaker.</p>
    <p>When she has cooked enough food to go around, she gives some to needy fam­i­lies, es­pe­cially larger ones with young chil­dren, those with one bread­win­ner, or with par­ents who have med­i­cal con­di­tions.</p>
    <p>The 41-year-old is among the Sin­ga­pore­ans in the Na­tional Day Pa­rade (NDP) “sto­ries of strength” film today, as part of 55 sto­ries of peo­ple who em­body strength and re­silience. Twenty sto­ries are show­cased in the morn­ing pa­rade seg­ment, with the rest in the of­fi­cial mu­sic video and the evening show.</p>
    <p>Ms Dil­jan’s friend­ship with her neigh­bours – who come from all races – be­gan when she saw them sit­ting by them­selves out­side their homes, or at the void deck of their rental block. “When I cooked food, they would eat it in front of me and say ‘it’s very nice’, and share more about them­selves,” she says.</p>
    <p>Ms Dil­jan, who started vol­un­teer­ing at 21 as a grass­roots mem­ber, es­ti­mates the ex­penses come up to $30 a day, though she some­times uses food do­nated by a food bank. The cook­ing in­volves only one meal a day, and not every day.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker, when she could not visit her neigh­bours, she would phone them. Other vol­un­teers in Yio Chu Kang also visit res­i­dents, es­pe­cially when they do not an­swer calls.</p>
    <p>“One se­nior cit­i­zen fell at home, and did not an­swer calls. When I vis­ited, I saw that she couldn’t walk, and called the po­lice to break open the gate,” she says.</p>
    <p>She hopes to re­sume her food dis­tri­bu­tion next month, though she moved last De­cem­ber to Can­berra Cres­cent, four MRT stops away.</p>
    <p>Four other moth­ers in their 40s in Yio Chu Kang have joined in to sup­port Ms Dil­jan. They dis­trib­ute bento boxes spon­sored by the char­ity Be­yond So­cial Ser­vices.</p>
    <p>Her fam­ily, in­clud­ing two daugh­ters aged 15 and five, helps out. Ms Dil­jan, whose hus­band is a wiring tech­ni­cian, says of be­ing fea­tured in the NDP: “I feel hon­oured and happy. At the same time, I hope more peo­ple would come on board to do vol­un­teer work, be­cause there are still a lot of peo­ple who still need help.”</p>
