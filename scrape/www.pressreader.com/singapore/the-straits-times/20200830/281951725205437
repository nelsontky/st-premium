    <p>Aus­tralian Prime Min­is­ter Scott Mor­ri­son wants to en­able the fed­eral govern­ment to can­cel state and univer­sity deals with for­eign gov­ern­ments in a move that ap­pears to be aimed at China and is set to fur­ther in­flame ten­sions with Bei­jing.</p>
    <p>The fed­eral govern­ment re­vealed last Thurs­day that a pro­posed new law would ap­ply to at least 135 ex­ist­ing agree­ments with 30 coun­tries that could be re­viewed and po­ten­tially ve­toed.</p>
    <p>De­spite its in­sis­tence that the leg­is­la­tion is not aimed at China, the main mo­ti­va­tion ap­pears to be con­cern that states and uni­ver­si­ties have been mak­ing deals with Chi­nese en­ti­ties which Can­berra be­lieves pose se­cu­rity risks.</p>
    <p>The govern­ment has been crit­i­cal of Vic­to­ria state’s de­ci­sion to join China’s Belt and Road Ini­tia­tive (BRI) and has raised con­cerns about uni­ver­si­ties col­lab­o­rat­ing with Chi­nese aca­demics on sen­si­tive tech­nol­ogy.</p>
    <p>Mr Mor­ri­son said last Thurs­day that the fed­eral govern­ment was re­spon­si­ble for set­ting Aus­tralia’s for­eign pol­icy and should en­sure that other Aus­tralian au­thor­i­ties can­not un­der­mine Can­berra’s ef­forts to pur­sue the na­tional in­ter­est. But he in­sisted that the laws were not specif­i­cally aimed at China.</p>
    <p>“It is vi­tal that when it comes to Aus­tralia’s deal­ings with the rest of the world, we speak with one voice and work to one plan,” he told re­porters.</p>
    <p>“What (is) im­por­tant in that re­la­tion­ship (with China) is that we’re all very clear about what our in­ter­ests are and that we’re con­sis­tent about it.”</p>
    <p>Aus­tralia’s ties with China, its largest trad­ing part­ner, have de­te­ri­o­rated in re­cent years, par­tic­u­larly as Can­berra in­tro­duced laws to pre­vent for­eign in­ter­fer­ence and banned Chi­nese firm Huawei from par­tic­i­pat­ing in its 5G roll-out.</p>
    <p>Re­la­tions fur­ther de­clined this year when Mr Mor­ri­son called for an in­quiry into the ori­gins of the Covid-19 pan­demic – a move that ap­peared to be tar­geted at Bei­jing.</p>
    <p>Yet trade be­tween the coun­tries con­tin­ues to soar. Of­fi­cial data re­leased this month showed China now ac­counts for a record 49 per cent of Aus­tralian ex­ports, fuelled by surg­ing iron-ore ex­ports.</p>
    <p>Can­berra has wel­comed the growing trade while si­mul­ta­ne­ously im­pos­ing lim­its on the re­la­tion­ship, es­pe­cially by pre­vent­ing Chi­nese in­vest­ment in sen­si­tive in­fra­struc­ture.</p>
    <p>Ear­lier last week, for in­stance, the govern­ment con­firmed it had blocked a A$600 mil­lion (S$600 mil­lion) deal to sell a dairy busi­ness, Lion Dairy and Drinks, to Chi­nese firm China Meng­niu Dairy, say­ing the sale was “con­trary to the na­tional in­ter­est”.</p>
    <p>Mr Mor­ri­son would not say last Thurs­day whether he planned to ban Vic­to­ria’s agree­ment last Oc­to­ber with Bei­jing to co­op­er­ate on BRI projects.</p>
    <p>But he said: “Where any for­eign govern­ment seeks to un­der­mine the sovereignt­y of Aus­tralia’s for­eign pol­icy by seek­ing to do deals with sub­na­tional gov­ern­ments, Aus­tralia needs to pro­tect it­self.”</p>
    <p>Mr Peter Jen­nings, ex­ec­u­tive di­rec­tor of the Aus­tralian Strate­gic Pol­icy In­sti­tute think-tank, said he sup­ported the new leg­is­la­tion, and that Vic­to­ria had pur­sued the BRI deal de­spite Can­berra’s op­po­si­tion.</p>
    <p>He said the law could also en­able the govern­ment to re­view a con­tro­ver­sial lease of the port of Dar­win to a Chi­nese firm – a deal that has an­gered Wash­ing­ton. The port is close to a base where United States</p>
    <p>Marines are sta­tioned.</p>
    <p>But Pro­fes­sor James Lau­rence­son, di­rec­tor of Univer­sity of Tech­nol­ogy Syd­ney’s Aus­tralia-China Re­la­tions In­sti­tute, said the leg­is­la­tion ap­peared to be “an over­re­ac­tion”, not­ing that Vic­to­ria’s BRI deal had not pre­vented Can­berra from tak­ing a tough ap­proach on China.</p>
    <p>“China will see it (the law) as an­other mea­sure that is tar­geted at China,” he told ABC News.</p>
    <p>Mr Colin Bar­nett, a former premier of Western Aus­tralia state, said the law was “ap­palling” and would dam­age ties with Bei­jing. He said it could lead to the can­cel­la­tion of a deal made by the state with China in 2011 to boost trade and in­vest­ment.</p>
    <p>The La­bor op­po­si­tion party in­di­cated sup­port for the new law, which makes it likely to pass.</p>
    <p>The law al­lows Aus­tralian For­eign Min­is­ter Marise Payne to ex­am­ine all ex­ist­ing and fu­ture deals with for­eign gov­ern­ments and to abol­ish or can­cel them.</p>
    <p>All deals will be in­cluded in a pub­lic regis­ter.</p>
    <p>The law ex­cludes com­pa­nies but cov­ers lo­cal coun­cils which enter into sis­ter-city ar­range­ments with for­eign en­ti­ties.</p>
    <p>Within six months of the law com­ing into ef­fect, states, ter­ri­to­ries, coun­cils and uni­ver­si­ties will have to no­tify the fed­eral govern­ment of all ar­range­ments with for­eign gov­ern­ments.</p>
    <p>The fed­eral govern­ment re­vealed last Thurs­day that a pro­posed new law would ap­ply to at least 135 ex­ist­ing agree­ments with 30 coun­tries that could be re­viewed and po­ten­tially ve­toed. De­spite its in­sis­tence that the leg­is­la­tion is not aimed at China, the main mo­ti­va­tion ap­pears to be con­cern that states and uni­ver­si­ties have been mak­ing deals with Chi­nese en­ti­ties which Can­berra be­lieves pose se­cu­rity risks.</p>
