    <p>Hong Kong po­lice yes­ter­day drew flak over their rough ar­rest of a 12-year-old girl, who said she was caught in a crowd of pro­test­ers while out buy­ing art sup­plies.</p>
    <p>Vi­ral video footage showed riot po­lice round­ing up a group of peo­ple in Mong Kok, in­clud­ing the girl, who tried to flee but was roughly pushed to the ground and pinned down by of­fi­cers.</p>
    <p>She was among about 300 peo­ple ar­rested on Sun­day amid the city’s big­gest street protest since July 1, as hun­dreds demon­strated against the post­pone­ment of leg­isla­tive elec­tions and a new na­tional se­cu­rity law.</p>
    <p>The girl, who was bruised in the or­deal, said she had gone out with her elder brother to buy art sup­plies for school, but they were forced to turn back as the area had been cor­doned off by po­lice.</p>
    <p>“When the po­lice sud­denly rushed over, I was very scared,” she told lo­cal broad­caster i-Ca­ble News. “They in­structed us to stand there, but I pan­icked, so I ran.”</p>
    <p>The po­lice force con­firmed the in­ci­dent, but de­fended its of­fi­cers in a state­ment posted on Face­book, say­ing that the girl had acted “sus­pi­ciously” and that “min­i­mum nec­es­sary force” had been used on her.</p>
    <p>The girl’s mother told Ap­ple Daily she would file a for­mal com­plaint, adding that both her chil­dren were fined un­der virus-re­lated laws against gath­er­ings.</p>
    <p>Pro-democ­racy leg­is­la­tor Clau­dia Mo said the in­ci­dent “showed how un­nec­es­sar­ily jumpy trig­ger-happy Hong Kong po­lice had be­come”, The Guardian re­ported.</p>
    <p>Sun­day’s protests marked the day leg­isla­tive elec­tions would have been held, had Hong Kong leader Car­rie Lam not post­poned them for a year ow­ing to the dan­ger of fu­elling the city’s Covid-19 out­break.</p>
    <p>She has been ac­cused of us­ing the pan­demic to sup­press the op­po­si­tion.</p>
    <p>Pro­test­ers also called for the re­lease of 12 Hong Kongers ar­rested by the Chi­nese coast guard while try­ing to flee to Tai­wan in a speed­boat. The group had been in­ter­cepted some 70km south-east of Hong Kong on Aug 23.</p>
    <p>They were handed over to the po­lice in neigh­bour­ing Shen­zhen and have since dis­ap­peared into China’s opaque judicial sys­tem.</p>
    <p>Lawyers rep­re­sent­ing some of them yes­ter­day said they had been de­nied ac­cess to their clients.</p>
    <p>“They said I can’t prove that the in­struc­tions I have came from fam­ily mem­bers, even though I have pro­vided my client’s birth cer­tifi­cate is­sued in Hong Kong,” said Mr Ren Quan­niu, a lawyer who trav­elled 1,500km from cen­tral China to Shen­zhen.</p>
    <p>He said the po­lice of­fi­cer in charge of the case re­fused to re­ceive le­gal doc­u­ments, in­clud­ing a writ­ten re­quest for his client Wong Wai Yin to be handed back to Hong Kong ju­ris­dic­tion.</p>
    <p>Mr Lu Si­wei, an­other lawyer, said he had a sim­i­lar ex­pe­ri­ence when he tried to visit his client in de­ten­tion last week.</p>
    <p>Both lawyers said Shen­zhen po­lice were treat­ing the case as an “il­le­gal bor­der cross­ing”, an of­fence that car­ries up to a year in jail.</p>
    <p>But Mr Lu said po­lice had in­formed him that some of the de­tainees may also face the more se­ri­ous charge of “or­gan­is­ing oth­ers to cross the bor­der il­le­gally”, which car­ries sen­tences of up to life in jail.</p>
    <p>The prospect of Hong Kongers get­ting en­tan­gled in China’s judicial sys­tem was the spark that last year lit seven months of huge and of­ten vi­o­lent pro-democ­racy protests.</p>
