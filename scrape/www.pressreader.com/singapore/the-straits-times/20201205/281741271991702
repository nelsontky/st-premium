    <p>•</p>
    <p>Dr Sard­jono Utomo, a se­nior In­done­sian doc­tor, ad­mit­ted him­self to his local hospi­tal in East Java late on Tues­day af­ter­noon.</p>
    <p>In just over 24 hours, as his fel­low doc­tors called hospi­tal af­ter hospi­tal in search of a ven­ti­la­tor in Surabaya – In­done­sia’s sec­ond­largest city and a few hours’ drive away – the doc­tor and his wife Sri Mar­tini were both dead.</p>
    <p>The death of Dr Sard­jono and his wife from Covid-19 has raised alarm bells in the world’s fourth­most-pop­u­lated na­tion, where the pan­demic has steadily gone from bad to worse and is now putting sig­nif­i­cant strain on the coun­try’s poorly equipped health sys­tem.</p>
    <p>In the past 10 days, In­done­sia posted four daily record high num­bers – the high­est was on Thurs­day, with 8,369 new cases – while local news ran head­lines of more re­gional hos­pi­tals reach­ing full ca­pac­ity.</p>
    <p>“It seems like the cur­rent over­ca­pac­ity sit­u­a­tion is the worst it has been through­out the Covid-19 pan­demic in In­done­sia,” Mr Ha­lik Ma­lik, spokesman for the In­done­sian Med­i­cal As­so­ci­a­tion, told Reuters.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, a study from the Ei­jk­man-Ox­ford Clin­i­cal Re­search Unit (EOCRU) showed that</p>
    <p>Covid-19 pa­tients in Greater Jakarta died within an av­er­age of 11 days af­ter they started hav­ing symp­toms, which is faster com­pared with pa­tients from other coun­tries.</p>
    <p>The study, which was con­ducted within the first five months of the pan­demic, also re­vealed that the area has the high­est mor­tal­ity rate for chil­dren aged un­der five.</p>
    <p>These con­di­tions are caused by late de­tec­tion and late hos­pi­tal­i­sa­tion.</p>
    <p>EOCRU re­searcher Henry Suren­dra said the study in­volved 4,265 adult and child pa­tients at 55 dif­fer­ent Covid-19 hos­pi­tals.</p>
    <p>The study also found that the in­fec­tion pat­tern for pa­tients i n Jakarta re­flects the con­di­tion of Covid-19 pa­tients world­wide.</p>
    <p>Most pa­tients ex­pe­ri­ence fever, cough­ing, breath­ing dif­fi­cul­ties and dis­com­fort, and more than 40 per cent are di­ag­nosed with pneu­mo­nia upon be­ing ad­mit­ted to hospi­tal.</p>
    <p>Pub­lic health ex­perts say In­done­sia has strug­gled since March to get the pan­demic un­der con­trol, with 563,680 cases yes­ter­day and 17,479 con­firmed deaths – plus an­other nearly 70,000 sus­pected cases. It has by far the high­est caseload and death toll in South­east Asia, and the data shows the sit­u­a­tion is in­ten­si­fy­ing.</p>
    <p>In Pamekasan, a mod­est dis­trict on Madura Is­land bor­dered by the Java Sea, where Dr Sard­jono worked for years as a hospi­tal di­rec­tor, there is not a sin­gle ven­ti­la­tor in town.</p>
    <p>But when the 67-year-old ra­di­ol­o­gist ar­rived at Pamekasan’s Mo­ham­mad Noer Hospi­tal, he des­per­ately needed one.</p>
    <p>“Ev­ery­where was full. And ev­ery­thing is full here in Pamekasan,” said Dr Syai­ful Hi­dayat, a pul­mo­nolo­gist who treated Dr Sard­jono. “Now it is peak­ing.” Dr Sard­jono’s son-in-law, 41-year-old Arif Rah­man, said the deaths of his in-laws high­lighted how ill-equipped the na­tion’s hos­pi­tals were to han­dle the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>He said: “Ven­ti­la­tors are im­por­tant. In Pamekasan, which is a re­fer­ral for other re­gions, it is of course piti­ful. Let alone in other places like Surabaya, where hos­pi­tals are al­ways full.”</p>
    <p>Asked why Dr Sard­jono could not find a ven­ti­la­tor, Surabaya gov­ern­ment spokesman Fe­bri­ad­hitya Pra­jatara said they had tried too late and the city was not to blame.</p>
    <p>The city’s in­ten­sive care unit (ICU) ca­pac­ity, he said, was at 66 per cent.</p>
    <p>West Java Gov­er­nor Rid­wan Kamil said on Wed­nes­day that the oc­cu­pancy rate for iso­la­tion rooms in Bo­gor, De­pok, Bekasi and Ban­dung had reached 80 per cent.</p>
    <p>In the cap­i­tal Jakarta, there is also cause for con­cern. La­porCovid-19, an in­de­pen­dent coro­n­avirus data ini­tia­tive, warned this week that Jakarta’s emer­gency wards were veer­ing to­wards “col­lapse”.</p>
    <p>In help­ing coro­n­avirus pa­tients find hospi­tal beds from Nov 27 to 29, La­porCovid-19 con­tacted emer­gency wards at 69 hos­pi­tals and dis­cov­ered that 97 per cent were full.</p>
    <p>“The over­ca­pac­ity of ICUs in re­fer­ral hos­pi­tals for Covid-19 in some ar­eas in­di­cates the gov­ern­ment’s han­dling of the pan­demic is less than se­ri­ous,” said Ms Irma Hi­dayana, the ini­tia­tive’s co-founder.</p>
