    <p>HONG KONG/BEIJING • China has said it would re­voke the li­cences of two hu­man rights l awyers i nvolved in the case of 12 Hong Kongers who the Chi­nese au­thor­i­ties ar­rested at sea and ac­cused of try­ing to flee to Tai­wan, ac­cord­ing to the two lawyers.</p>
    <p>One of them, Mr Ren Quan­niu, said the au­thor­i­ties warned him in Septem­ber that tak­ing on the case could im­peril his li­cence. The lawyers said they had re­ceived let­ters on Mon­day about re­vok­ing their li­cences, and were given three days to ap­peal. Both said they in­tended to do so.</p>
    <p>Fam­i­lies of two of the de­fen­dants ap­pointed Mr Ren and Mr Lu Si­wei to rep­re­sent them, but the lawyers were de­nied ac­cess.</p>
    <p>The 12 were rep­re­sented in court by lawyers ap­pointed by the Chi­nese au­thor­i­ties.</p>
    <p>China’s Min­istry of Jus­tice did not im­me­di­ately re­spond to a re­quest for com­ment.</p>
    <p>Both lawyers have been crit­i­cal of China’s le­gal process, and say the li­cence threat is linked to the Hong Kongers’ case, which drew crit­i­cism from in­ter­na­tional rights groups and for­eign gov­ern­ments. Mr Ren had rep­re­sented cit­i­zen­jour­nal­ist Zhang Zhan who was given four years’ jail over her re­port­ing on the coro­n­avirus in Wuhan.</p>
    <p>Ten of the 12 Hong Kongers were last week given be­tween seven months and three years’ jail by a Shen­zhen court for il­le­gal bor­der cross­ing. Two were re­turned to Hong Kong for trial on charges linked to last year’s protests.</p>
    <p>The let­ters were is­sued by the ju­ris­dic­tions where the lawyers are based. If they lose their li­cences, they will be un­able to prac­tice law in China.</p>
    <p>In a let­ter from the jus­tice depart­ment of Sichuan prov­ince seen by Reuters, Mr Lu was ac­cused of “mak­ing mul­ti­ple in­ap­pro­pri­ate re­marks on­line” over a long pe­riod of time, “se­verely dam­ag­ing the im­age of the in­dus­try” and “caus­ing neg­a­tive im­pacts on so­ci­ety”. He told Reuters: “I have no re­grets.”</p>
    <p>Mr Ren showed Reuters a let­ter from the He­nan prov­ince jus­tice depart­ment ac­cus­ing him of vi­o­lat­ing reg­u­la­tions over a case he took in 2018 rep­re­sent­ing a de­fen­dant in a re­li­gious mat­ter. The He­nan depart­ment did not im­me­di­ately re­spond to a re­quest for com­ment. The Sichuan jus­tice depart­ment could not be reached for com­ment.</p>
    <p>Mr Ren said that a lo­cal lawyers’ as­so­ci­a­tion, the lo­cal jus­tice depart­ment, and lo­cal na­tional se­cu­rity of­fi­cers had pres­sured him to drop the Hong Kong case in Septem­ber, warn­ing af­ter an ini­tial at­tempt to visit the de­tainee that his li­cence was at stake.</p>
    <p>The family of de­tainee Wong Wai Yin, who hired Mr Ren, said they were ap­palled by the news.</p>
    <p>Rights groups say hu­man rights lawyers in China are rou­tinely tar­geted with jail terms and dis­bar­ment, and such pres­sure has in­ten­si­fied in re­cent years un­der a crack­down on dis­sent un­der Pres­i­dent Xi Jin­ping.</p>
