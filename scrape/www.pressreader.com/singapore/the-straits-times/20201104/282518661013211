    <p>NEW YORK • The Philadel­phia 76ers and Daryl Morey seem like an ideal match.</p>
    <p>For the Six­ers, who in­tro­duced Morey on Mon­day as pres­i­dent of bas­ket­ball op­er­a­tions, he is an ex­ec­u­tive who gives their front of­fice cred­i­bil­ity. For the 48-yearold, the job is a chance to trans­form a fran­chise with mar­quee players into ti­tle con­tenders.</p>
    <p>But trans­for­ma­tions re­quire in­sti­tu­tional buy-in from all corners of a fran­chise. Morey’s track record as an an­a­lyt­ics-driven tinkerer will­ing to blow up “good” in or­der to be “great” may not jibe with other parts of the or­gan­i­sa­tion – the ones that judge or are judged on wins and losses, or that need wins to make money.</p>
    <p>Yet, with Morey, this can work. But it will re­quire some­thing own­ers al­ways say they have but of­ten do not: pa­tience.</p>
    <p>Morey, who helped usher in the an­a­lyt­ics move­ment in the Na­tional Bas­ket­ball As­so­ci­a­tion (NBA), made his way to Philadel­phia after an­nounc­ing his in­tent last month to re­sign from the Hous­ton Rock­ets, where he had been gen­eral man­ager since 2007. But just adding a big name to the front of­fice will not mag­i­cally fix the Six­ers, who were swept in the first round of the play-offs by the Bos­ton Celtics.</p>
    <p>“The best way to win in the NBA is to take your tal­ent and fig­ure out how to utilise them best,” Morey said at a news con­fer­ence on Mon­day, adding that stars Joel Em­biid and Ben Sim­mons “ab­so­lutely can work to­gether”.</p>
    <p>He will have two months or even longer to work with the Six­ers after com­mis­sioner Adam Sil­ver re­port­edly told gen­eral man­agers on Mon­day that talks with the players’ union were at an im­passe, with the league “run­ning out of time” for the new sea­son to start next month. The cur­rent 72-game pro­posal in­cludes a Dec 22 tip-off, but the players pre­fer a Jan­uary start.</p>
