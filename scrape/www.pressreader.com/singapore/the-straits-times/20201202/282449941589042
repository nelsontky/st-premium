    <p>With an equal propen­sity to ex­cite and ex­as­per­ate, Tampines Rovers for­ward Jordan Webb is un­doubt­edly one of the Sin­ga­pore Premier League’s (SPL) colour­ful per­son­al­i­ties.</p>
    <p>On Nov 17, the Cana­dian was the hat-trick hero who in­spired the Stags to a come­back 3-1 win over the Young Lions and reached 101 SPL goals in 11 sea­sons. Just five days later, he was sent off for be­rat­ing the ref­eree and sus­pended for two games, as his team were held 2-2 by bot­tom side Tan­jong Pa­gar.</p>
    <p>Webb, 32, later posted a video apol­ogy on his Face­book page. Ahead of to­day’s key clash against Lion City Sailors, he said: “I messed up. I gave the ref­eree an op­por­tu­nity to dis­miss me and I put my team in the po­si­tion to play with 10 men when I could have stayed on to help them win the game. I could have avoided that.</p>
    <p>“I know I need to re­act bet­ter to things, and chan­nel the anger into some­thing pos­i­tive when things don’t go my way. But it’s eas­ier said than done be­cause I’m a pas­sion­ate com­peti­tor.</p>
    <p>“I’m just thank­ful I have my coaches and fam­ily supporting me, and I’m try­ing to be a bet­ter per­son on the field for my team.”</p>
    <p>Tampines man­aged to beat Hougang United 2-0 and Al­birex Ni­igata 4-1 in his ab­sence over the past week and now lead the stand­ings on 27 points, one ahead of the Ja­panese side with two games left. They end off against Gey­lang In­ter­na­tional on Satur­day.</p>
    <p>Vic­tory over the third-placed Sailors (23 points) would edge Tampines closer to the ti­tle – their last cham­pi­onship was in 2013 – and also con­firm them as the high­est-placed lo­cal team which brings with it a cov­eted spot in next sea­son’s AFC Cham­pi­ons League.</p>
    <p>Al­birex face Tan­jong Pa­gar to­day.</p>
    <p>Webb, who scored one and had three as­sists when the Stags beat the Sailors 4-0 in March be­fore the</p>
    <p>sea­son was halted due to the pan­demic, said: “We have to win this game be­fore we talk about the next. The Sailors are a good team, but we be­lieve we will play well as long as we keep our brand of foot­ball and stick to our game plan.”</p>
    <p>He had trav­elled 15,000km from On­tario, Canada to play for Sengkang Pung­gol (now Hougang) in 2010 on the rec­om­men­da­tion of his cousin An­thony Ba­hadur, who was with the team the year be­fore.</p>
    <p>In do­ing so, he broke a two-year foot­ball schol­ar­ship with the Iowa Cen­tral Com­mu­nity Col­lege while his par­ents and three sis­ters were liv­ing in a shel­ter.</p>
    <p>Webb went on to win the Sin­ga­pore Cup with Home United in</p>
    <p>2013 and with Tampines last year, and is de­ter­mined to add the league ti­tle to his bounty this sea­son.</p>
    <p>Look­ing back at his 11 sea­sons here, he said: “It’s not the English Premier League, but ev­ery­one’s jour­ney is dif­fer­ent. I’m su­per grate­ful be­cause Sin­ga­pore gave me al­most ev­ery­thing I could ask for.</p>
    <p>“My first pay cheque here was $800, and I went on to be­ing able to send money back to my fam­ily. I met great peo­ple and learnt a lot. I have played with Jer­maine Pen­nant and Billy Mehmet, took my game to an­other level.”</p>
    <p>He was cir­cum­spect about his un­suc­cess­ful at­tempts to se­cure Sin</p>
    <p>gapore cit­i­zen­ship and play for the na­tional team and said the process col­lapsed af­ter for­mer Lions coach Bernd Stange left in 2016.</p>
    <p>“I had of­fers from Malaysia and Por­tu­gal but I chose to stay be­cause we are build­ing some­thing spe­cial here,” Webb said.</p>
    <p>“Not ev­ery­one likes the way I play, but I would be wor­ried if no­body hates me. Luck­ily, I usu­ally de­liver – how many wingers can score 100 goals in a pro­fes­sional league?”</p>
    <p>Tampines coach Gavin Lee said Webb, who has seven SPL goals and four as­sists this term, comes from a dif­fer­ent cul­ture and can be eas­ily mis­un­der­stood.</p>
    <p>He noted: “Some­times, peo­ple’s first im­pres­sion of him is not re­flec­tive of the gen­uine and com­pas­sion­ate per­son he is. Not many peo­ple know the small ges­tures he does, such as buy­ing fruits for ev­ery­one be­fore every train­ing ses­sion.</p>
    <p>“He means well, con­nects well with the youths in outreach pro­grammes, and has a good re­la­tion­ship with our younger play­ers.</p>
    <p>“We recog­nise the ef­forts of those who have come in and stepped up when we were with­out Jo, but it is al­ways bet­ter to have him in the team than not, be­cause he is a top player and a threat with his goals and as­sists.”</p>
