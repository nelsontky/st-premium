    <p>A resur­gence of coro­n­avirus cases will soon put doc­tors at Jakarta’s main hos­pi­tal for Covid-19 in the po­si­tion of hav­ing to de­cide who gets a pre­cious in­ten­sive care unit (ICU) bed and who doesn’t.</p>
    <p>In some re­spects, that is al­ready hap­pen­ing at the Friend­ship Hos­pi­tal, the In­done­sian cap­i­tal’s big­gest govern­ment-run med­i­cal fa­cil­ity.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing a seven-day pe­riod that ended on Thurs­day, the hos­pi­tal re­ceived re­quests to take an av­er­age 83 pa­tients a day – more than dou­ble the re­quested re­fer­rals dur­ing the same pe­riod in July.</p>
    <p>As the num­ber of trained staff is lim­ited, most re­quests are turned down. On Thurs­day, the hos­pi­tal re­ceived 103 re­fer­rals and ac­cepted only 12.</p>
    <p>Last week, in­fec­tions tested new highs, nearly six months af­ter the first Covid-19 cases emerged.</p>
    <p>On Friday, case num­bers i n Jakarta surged anew, climb­ing to 869, eclips­ing by more than 100 the previous day’s tally – it­self a record. Na­tion­ally, in­fec­tions soared to an­other record for the third suc­ces­sive day yes­ter­day, with 3,308 new cases re­ported, tak­ing to­tal in­fec­tions to over 169,000.</p>
    <p>The surge has halted the cap­i­tal’s grad­ual re­open­ing. On Thurs­day, Jakarta Gov­er­nor Anies Baswedan shelved plans to re­open bars and night­clubs.</p>
    <p>Pro­fes­sor Wiku Adis­as­mito, a spokesman for In­done­sia’s Covid-19 task force, at­trib­uted the spike in cases, at least in part, to in­con­sis­tent re­port­ing across In­done­sia’s more than 300 lab­o­ra­to­ries. “The govern­ment’s ob­jec­tives are very clear; fast and prompt re­sponse... for all In­done­sians to help cre­ate a healthy and safe In­done­sia from Covid-19,” he said on Friday in a vir­tual brief­ing hosted by the Jakarta For­eign Cor­re­spon­dents Club.</p>
    <p>At the Friend­ship Hos­pi­tal, or Rumah Sakit Per­sa­ha­batan, doc­tors are grap­pling with the idea that they will have to triage pa­tients – de­cid­ing whose con­di­tion is more se­ri­ous yet treat­able – for an ICU bed.</p>
    <p>This is not far off, said Dr Er­lina Burhan, a spokesman for the hos­pi­tal who also dou­bles as a spokesman for the In­done­sian Med­i­cal Doc­tor As­so­ci­a­tion.</p>
    <p>“I’m wor­ried that soon, we will get to a point where we have to play God,” she said.“I’m ner­vous.”</p>
    <p>The Friend­ship Hos­pi­tal, built in the 1960s with Soviet help, has be­come one of the cap­i­tal’s last lines of de­fence for those se­verely or crit­i­cally ill with Covid-19 since it closed all but 206 of its 700 or so beds in March to spe­cialise in the fight against the dis­ease.</p>
    <p>Two other hos­pi­tals, Su­lianti Saroso and a mil­i­tary hos­pi­tal, pro­vide sim­i­lar lev­els of care and have 150 beds be­tween them.</p>
    <p>But with its full com­ple­ment of 200 pul­monary spe­cial­ists, anaes­the­si­ol­o­gists and other spe­cial­ists as well as more than 100 ICU nurses, Friend­ship Hos­pi­tal tends to take the lion’s share of re­fer­rals from the cap­i­tal’s 64 other hos­pi­tals charged with tend­ing to those in­fected by the virus.</p>
    <p>But be­cause beds are scarce, scores of peo­ple are turned away ev­ery day. Since July, Friend­ship Hos­pi­tal has not ac­cepted more than 17 re­fer­rals per day, ac­cord­ing to hos­pi­tal data.</p>
    <p>In­done­sia has four doc­tors per 10,000 peo­ple – half the pro­por­tion in In­dia and less than a third the ra­tio in neigh­bour­ing Malaysia, ac­cord­ing to World Bank data.</p>
    <p>“Our big­gest lim­i­ta­tion is hu­man re­sources,” said Dr Er­nita Ak­mal, an ICU anaes­the­si­ol­o­gist at the hos­pi­tal.</p>
    <p>On close-cir­cuit TV be­hind her, a nurse in pro­tec­tive gear tends to a crit­i­cally ill pa­tient on a ven­ti­la­tor in the ICU unit where all 16 beds are full.</p>
    <p>“Af­ter six months,” Dr Er­nita said, “every­one is ex­hausted”.</p>
    <p>The Friend­ship Hos­pi­tal closed all but 206 of its</p>
    <p>700 or so beds in March to spe­cialise in the fight against the dis­ease... But be­cause beds are scarce, scores of peo­ple are turned away ev­ery day. Since July, it has not ac­cepted more than 17 re­fer­rals per day.</p>
    <p>Thai Air­ways In­ter­na­tional said it would op­er­ate at least two such flights a month starting in late Novem­ber to con­nect Phuket with coun­tries such as Den­mark, Ger­many and the United King­dom. “Many se­niors don’t want to spend their time in a cold harsh win­ter. They want trop­i­cal weather,” said Mr Boon.</p>
    <p>Around 90 per cent of Thon­buri’s cus­tomers be­fore the pan­demic were in­ter­na­tional.</p>
    <p>But it is un­clear if the govern­ment in­tends to let in so many for­eign­ers. On Thurs­day, Thai­land’s deputy army chief said the coun­try was mulling plans to re­open to long-stay vis­i­tors and for­eign­ers who own lo­cal prop­erty, but this would amount to only “hun­dreds” of peo­ple.</p>
    <p>The econ­omy is need of a boost.</p>
    <p>Be­fore the pan­demic, European tourists would va­ca­tion in Phuket and the sur­round­ing ar­eas for be­tween two weeks and two months, said Mr Bhum­mikitti Ruk­taengam, pres­i­dent of the Phuket Tourist As­so­ci­a­tion.</p>
    <p>More than 6.7 mil­lion Euro­peans vis­ited Thai­land last year and con­trib­uted 461 bil­lion baht (S$20.1 bil­lion) to the Thai econ­omy, ac­cord­ing to govern­ment data.</p>
    <p>They made up about 17 per cent of to­tal for­eign vis­i­tors and 24 per cent of to­tal for­eign spend­ing. in des­per­ate</p>
