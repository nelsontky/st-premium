    <p>Un­til last week, the world knew tech titan Jack Ma as China’s rich­est per­son. That changed on Wed­nes­day when a for­mer jour­nal­ist and mush­room farmer from Zhe­jiang over­took the Alibaba e-com­merce plat­form founder to be­come the top bil­lion­aire – though briefly – in the coun­try of 1.4 bil­lion peo­ple.</p>
    <p>Mr Zhong Shan­shan, who owns 84.4 per cent of Nongfu Spring – a pop­u­lar bot­tled wa­ter and bev­er­age maker in China – was pro­pelled to the list of China’s top three rich­est af­ter the ini­tial pub­lic of­fer­ing (IPO) of the com­pany in Hong Kong on Sept 8.</p>
    <p>Shares of Nongfu Spring – which sells tea, cof­fee, fruit juice and fresh pro­duce – closed 54 per cent above the is­sue price on de­but, af­ter soar­ing nearly 85 per cent at the open, China Daily re­ported.</p>
    <p>Mr Zhong is also the big­gest share­holder in vac­cine maker Bei­jing Wan­tai Bi­o­log­i­cal Phar­macy, which be­gan trad­ing on the Shanghai Stock Ex­change early this year.</p>
    <p>The dou­ble booster cat­a­pulted the 66-year-old’s net worth to US$58.7 bil­lion (S$80.9 bil­lion) last Wed­nes­day, US$2 bil­lion more than Mr Ma’s that day, ac­cord­ing to the Bloomberg Bil­lion­aires In­dex.</p>
    <p>“You would have typ­i­cally ex­pected the No. 1 in China to come from (tech­nol­ogy),” Mr Ru­pert Hoogew­erf, chair­man of wealth re­search firm Hu­run Re­port, was quoted as say­ing by CNN Busi­ness.</p>
    <p>“Zhong Shan­shan is one of the few peo­ple in China to not just build one US$10 bil­lion busi­ness, but two US$10 bil­lion busi­nesses.”</p>
    <p>How­ever, Mr Zhong’s reign at the top of the list was short-lived. A check of the Bloomberg in­dex by The Sun­day Times found that Mr Ma, the rich­est man in China for the past six years, had re­gained the top spot with a net worth of US$56.5 bil­lion. He was trailed by Mr Zhong with US$53 bil­lion.</p>
    <p>Lit­tle is known about Mr Zhong, a largely pri­vate per­son who does not grant many in­ter­views and rarely makes pub­lic ap­pear­ances, earn­ing him­self the nick­name “lone wolf”.</p>
    <p>Born in 1954 in Hangzhou, in Zhe­jiang prov­ince, Mr Zhong grew up dur­ing the tu­mul­tuous Cul­tural Rev­o­lu­tion, a so­ciopo­lit­i­cal move­ment that lasted from 1966 to 1976. He dropped out of ele­men­tary school and be­came an odd-job labourer, mov­ing from city to city for work, ac­cord­ing to me­dia re­ports.</p>
    <p>Af­ter the end of the Cul­tural Rev­o­lu­tion, Mr Zhong en­rolled in a uni­ver­sity and joined a Zhe­jiang daily as a busi­ness re­porter be­fore ven­tur­ing into busi­ness.</p>
    <p>In 1993, he founded Yang Sheng Tang to de­velop health­care prod­ucts, in­clud­ing “tur­tle pills” to treat erec­tile dys­func­tion in the 1990s.</p>
    <p>In 1996, the com­pany es­tab­lished Nongfu Spring as a sub­sidiary sell­ing pack­aged drink­ing wa­ter.</p>
    <p>In an ex­clu­sive interview with China Daily in 2016, Mr Zhong said Nongfu Spring’s ma­jor break­through came in 1999 when he an­nounced that the com­pany would stop sell­ing pu­ri­fied wa­ter to fo­cus on min­eral wa­ter as he claimed the for­mer of­fered no health ben­e­fits.</p>
    <p>Sales sky­rock­eted in­stantly but drew law­suits from 69 in­dig­nant pu­ri­fied wa­ter firms led by ma­jor player Hangzhou Wa­haha Group, which ac­cused Nongfu Spring of un­fair com­pe­ti­tion. Nongfu Spring lost the court bat­tle.</p>
    <p>But the saga hardly left a dent on Mr Zhong, said China Daily which also re­ported that the en­tre­pre­neur is mar­ried with three chil­dren.</p>
    <p>“Who would have thought that Zhong, a man who sells bot­tled wa­ter in the age of IT and post-Covid econ­omy, could ac­tu­ally be­come the rich­est man in China over­tak­ing Jack Ma and Pony Ma (of Ten­cent)?” said Mr Hoogew­erf.</p>
