    <p>DEN­PASAR • The In­done­sian is­land of Bali will re­main closed to for­eign vis­i­tors for the rest of this year af­ter the au­thor­i­ties post­poned a plan to wel­come back in­ter­na­tional tourists from Sept 11 as the coro­n­avirus con­tin­ues to spread.</p>
    <p>“The In­done­sian govern­ment couldn’t re­open its doors to for­eign trav­ellers un­til the end of 2020 as we re­main a red zone,” Bali Gov­er­nor Wayan Koster said in a state­ment. “The sit­u­a­tion is not con­ducive to al­low­ing for­eign tourists to come to In­done­sia, in­clud­ing to Bali.”</p>
    <p>A de­ci­sion on when for­eign tourism could re­sume would de­pend on the “as­sess­ment of the sit­u­a­tion in and out­side of the coun­try”, said Mr Koster.</p>
    <p>Af­ter some suc­cess in con­tain­ment early on, Bali’s in­fec­tion rate jumped in June as mi­grant work­ers re­turned home and test­ing i ncreased. The is­land had 4,576 con­firmed cases as of yes­ter­day and 52 deaths, while In­done­sia as a whole has more than 155,000 con­firmed cases and 6,759 deaths, govern­ment data showed.</p>
    <p>Bali has been open to lo­cal trav­ellers since the end of last month, and as many as 2,500 peo­ple have been ar­riv­ing through its air­port every day with­out caus­ing a spike in in­fec­tions, Mr Koster said.</p>
    <p>The lo­cal govern­ment will fo­cus on in­creas­ing the num­ber of do­mes­tic vis­i­tors to help the tourism in­dus­try and econ­omy re­cover, he said.</p>
    <p>More than six mil­lion for­eign tourists vis­ited Bali last year, ac­count­ing for more than a third of In­done­sia’s to­tal.</p>
    <p>The oc­cu­pancy rate at Bali’s starred ho­tels plunged to 2.07 per cent in May, ac­cord­ing to Bali’s sta­tis­tics bureau, from 62.55 per cent in De­cem­ber be­fore the pan­demic hit, and down from 51.56 per cent in May last year.</p>
    <p>The govern­ment warned in April that the pan­demic could wipe out more than US$10 bil­lion (S$13.7 bil­lion) of In­done­sia’s tourism rev­enue this year, a fore­cast that is likely to worsen now be­cause it as­sumed there would be some re­cov­ery in the sec­ond half.</p>
    <p>“Bali can­not fail be­cause it could ad­versely im­pact the im­age of In­done­sia, in­clud­ing Bali, in the eyes of the world, which could prove counter-pro­duc­tive to the re­cov­ery of travel,” Mr Koster said.</p>
    <p>IN THE RED ZONE</p>
    <p>We re­main a red zone. The sit­u­a­tion is not con­ducive to al­low­ing for­eign tourists to come to In­done­sia, in­clud­ing to Bali. ’’</p>
    <p>BALI GOV­ER­NOR WAYAN KOSTER, in a state­ment. Af­ter some suc­cess in con­tain­ment early on, Bali’s in­fec­tion rate jumped in June as mi­grant work­ers re­turned home and test­ing in­creased. The is­land had 4,576 con­firmed cases as of yes­ter­day and 52 deaths, while In­done­sia as a whole has more than 155,000 con­firmed cases and 6,759 deaths.</p>
