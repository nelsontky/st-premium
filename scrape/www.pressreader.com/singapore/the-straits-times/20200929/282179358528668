    <p>The long-awaited ini­tial public of­fer­ing (IPO) of Wil­mar In­ter­na­tional’s China unit has raised about 13.93 bil­lion yuan (S$2.8 bil­lion) af­ter the close of ap­pli­ca­tions last Fri­day, the com­pany an­nounced.</p>
    <p>Wil­mar said last Thurs­day that the list­ing of Yi­hai Kerry Arawana was ex­pected to raise 13.9 bil­lion yuan, with an is­sue price of 25.7 yuan a share.</p>
    <p>In­vestors were up­beat about the pro­posed list­ing on the Shen­zhen Stock Ex­change ChiNext Board.</p>
    <p>IPO shares for off­line in­vestors were over­sub­scribed by 600.5 times, rais­ing 5.82 bil­lion yuan. Stock for on­line re­tail in­vestors was over­sub­scribed by about 1,750 times, rais­ing 3.9 bil­lion yuan. Strate­gic in­vestors ac­counted for 4.18 bil­lion yuan.</p>
    <p>Wil­mar had pre­vi­ously said these strate­gic in­vestors would con­sti­tute 20 state-owned funds, sov­er­eign wealth funds and in­sur­ance com­pa­nies that have col­lec­tively been al­lo­cated 30 per cent of the IPO shares.</p>
    <p>These shares will be sub­ject to a one-year mora­to­rium on trans­fer, be­gin­ning from the first trad­ing date. Sin­ga­pore sov­er­eign wealth fund GIC was among the strate­gic in­vestors and was set to be al­lot­ted 472.5 mil­lion yuan.</p>
    <p>Al­though the pro­posed list­ing is slated to take place by the mid­dle of next month, Wil­mar has again stressed that there is “no cer­tainty” it will pro­ceed as it is still sub­ject to prevailing mar­ket con­di­tions. Wil­mar shares closed up 0.23 per cent at $4.41 yes­ter­day.</p>
