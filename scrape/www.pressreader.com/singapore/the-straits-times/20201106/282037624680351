    <p>Cus­tomers who or­dered Sim­mons, Sealy, Serta or King Koil mat­tresses from Robin­sons and have paid in full can ex­pect them to be de­liv­ered.</p>
    <p>The four brands gave the as­sur­ance even as Sin­ga­pore’s con­sumer watch­dog said the to­tal value of un­de­liv­ered mat­tresses – based on com­plaints by Robin­sons cus­tomers – is more than $145,000.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, the Con­sumers As­so­ci­a­tion of Sin­ga­pore (Case) said it had re­ceived 40 com­plaints about Robin­sons be­tween last Fri­day – when its liq­ui­da­tion was an­nounced – and 4pm yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Of these, 34 were from cus­tomers seek­ing a refund for or de­liv­ery of mat­tresses they had pre­paid Robin­sons par­tially or in full for fu­ture de­liv­ery.</p>
    <p>“Some of these con­sumers, who... bought the mat­tresses as early as Novem­ber 2019, were in­formed that their mat­tresses will not be de­liv­ered on the sched­uled de­liv­ery dates as Robin­sons has gone into liq­ui­da­tion,” said Case ex­ec­u­tive di­rec­tor Loy York Jiun.</p>
    <p>In sep­a­rate state­ments on Wed­nes­day, the four mat­tress mak­ers said they would hon­our the or­ders de­spite Robin­sons’ fail­ure to pay them.</p>
    <p>While Sim­mons, Serta and King Koil said they would make the de­liv­er­ies with no ex­tra charge, Sealy cus­tomers will have to pay a $50 de­liv­ery fee.</p>
    <p>All four com­pa­nies said they would con­tact each cus­tomer to ar­range for the de­liv­er­ies.</p>
    <p>A Sim­mons spokesman said that for cus­tomers who have made de­posits or par­tial pay­ments to Robin­sons, it will ab­sorb the pay­ments and con­tact these cus­tomers “as soon as pos­si­ble” to ad­vise them on their bal­ance pay­ments and how their or­ders might be ful­filled.</p>
    <p>A state­ment posted on King Koil Sin­ga­pore’s Face­book page also said the com­pany would ab­sorb the amounts cus­tomers have paid in de­posits or par­tial pay­ments.</p>
    <p>Sealy said it would ful­fil the or­ders of cus­tomers who have ei­ther paid de­posits or made par­tial pay­ments to Robin­sons for its prod­ucts.</p>
    <p>It added that “hun­dreds” of cus­tomers had paid Robin­sons in full, but it did not re­ceive pay­ment from Robin­sons to sup­ply or de­liver the mat­tresses.</p>
    <p>Serta Sin­ga­pore said it will ab­sorb all pay­ments made to Robin­sons in full or in part, even though it may not be re­im­bursed.</p>
    <p>It added that its rep­re­sen­ta­tives will reach out to cus­tomers to ad­vise them on ar­rears pay­ments and or­der fulfilment.</p>
    <p>Robin­sons’ liq­uida­tor, Kor­daMen­tha, said on Mon­day that it is aware of seven mat­tress sup­pli­ers that have been af­fected by the liq­ui­da­tion, and had re­ceived more than 300 e-mails about mat­tress or­ders.</p>
    <p>Five other com­plaints were re­lated to changes in the use of Robin­sons vouch­ers, which can now be used only if the cus­tomer spends at least twice the value of the vouch­ers, said a doc­u­ment on Kor­daMen­tha’s web­site.</p>
    <p>And a cus­tomer is seek­ing a refund on her Robin­sons gift card as she claims there are no items left in the store for her to buy.</p>
    <p>Case said that con­sumers who have paid by credit card and wish to get back their pre-pay­ments or de­posits can file charge­back re­quests with their banks within 120 days of the trans­ac­tion.</p>
