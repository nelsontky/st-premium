    <p>United States Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump and for­mer pres­i­dent Barack Obama hit the cam­paign trail in key toss-up states this week, with the pres­i­den­tial elec­tion just 12 days away.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump vis­ited Penn­syl­va­nia and North Carolina for ral­lies on Tues­day and Wed­nes­day.</p>
    <p>He said in North Carolina that the news me­dia’s in­ten­sive cov­er­age of the coro­n­avirus pan­demic has one pur­pose: “That’s all they put on, be­cause they want to scare the hell out of ev­ery­one.”</p>
    <p>Mr Trump added: “That pan­demic is round­ing the cor­ner. They hate it when I say it.”</p>
    <p>Mr Obama, on the stump for Mr Trump’s chal­lenger Joe Bi­den, vis­ited Penn­syl­va­nia on Wed­nes­day, where he at­tacked Mr Trump’s han­dling of the coro­n­avirus pan­demic.</p>
    <p>“Don­ald Trump isn’t sud­denly go­ing to pro­tect all of us. He can’t even take the ba­sic steps to pro­tect him­self,” Mr Obama said.</p>
    <p>Mr Bi­den’s run­ning mate, Se­na­tor Ka­mala Harris, also cam­paigned i n North Carolina on Wed­nes­day.</p>
    <p>The hand­ful of bat­tle­ground states are get­ting a lot of at­ten­tion as they could de­cide if Mr Trump wins a sec­ond term, or Mr Bi­den be­comes the 46th US pres­i­dent.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump and Mr Bi­den will face off in their sec­ond and fi­nal pres­i­den­tial de­bate on Thurs­day night (9am today Sin­ga­pore time).</p>
    <p>The Real Clear Pol­i­tics an­a­lyt­i­cal web­site’s pro­jec­tions show Mr Bi­den ahead in the Elec­toral Col­lege with a pro­jected 232 votes, with a ma­jor­ity of 270 re­quired to win the White House. Pres­i­dent Trump has 125 pro­jected votes.</p>
    <p>If United States Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump wins a sec­ond term, it will be be­cause of peo­ple like 33-year-old Ni­cholas van Or­den, whose car­pen­try and house-frame busi­ness be­gan thriv­ing when the real es­tate ty­coon won the White House in 2016.</p>
    <p>It will also be be­cause of peo­ple like Viet­namese-Amer­i­can Eric Le, 55, who fled com­mu­nism and now owns a nail sa­lon – and ap­pre­ci­ates that Mr Trump is tak­ing a stand against com­mu­nist China.</p>
    <p>And it will be be­cause of 65-yearold for­mer Marine James Crow, stand­ing on a grassy verge on a balmy North Carolina night us­ing his mo­bile phone to watch Mr Trump speak to a crowd of roughly 20,000 – ac­cord­ing to or­gan­is­ers – in the tiny, quaint Gas­to­nia Mu­nic­i­pal Air­port a cou­ple of miles up the road.</p>
    <p>“I got a raise after he got elected,” said Mr Crow, who works as a pickup and de­liv­ery driver. “The com­pany I work for was in trou­ble, then they got a loan.</p>
    <p>“He has al­ready made Amer­ica great again. I don’t agree with ev­ery­thing he says, but I agree with his poli­cies. Vet­er­ans’ hos­pi­tals are be­ing built ev­ery­where. He’s done more for vet­er­ans than any­one. And I am pro-law and or­der and pro-life as well, that’s very im­por­tant.”</p>
    <p>The Gas­to­nia rally came on the eve of the fi­nal pres­i­den­tial de­bate in Nashville, Ten­nessee.</p>
    <p>The de­bate will be in per­son but with changes to avoid the shout­ing match that the first one turned into. The can­di­date who is not speak­ing will have his mi­cro­phones muted so he can­not in­ter­rupt the other and the au­di­ence must wear masks.</p>
    <p>In the first de­bate, the Trump fam­ily was among those who waved away masks. Later the Pres­i­dent him­self was struck with Covid-19 and it re­mains un­clear whether he al­ready had the coro­n­avirus at the de­bate it­self.</p>
    <p>The Gas­to­nia rally came just 12 days be­fore the elec­tion, and on the same day the Demo­cratic Party turned up the heat, bring­ing for­mer pres­i­dent Barack Obama into the cam­paign with a fiery rally in Philadel­phia.</p>
    <p>The hope is to en­er­gise the so­called “Obama coali­tion” of African-Amer­i­can and north­ern white vot­ers which swept him to power in 2008 but sig­nif­i­cantly failed to turn out for Mrs Hil­lary Clin­ton in 2016.</p>
    <p>And Mr Bi­den’s run­ning mate, Se­na­tor Ka­mala Harris, was speak­ing in Char­lotte, North Carolina – just a short drive up the road from Gas­to­nia where Mr Trump poured scorn on Mr Obama to the de­light of the crowd that booed at ev­ery men­tion of the Democrats’ names.</p>
    <p>Men­tion­ing his 2016 win, Mr Trump said: “There was no­body that cam­paigned harder for crooked Hil­lary Clin­ton than Obama, right? He was all over the place.</p>
    <p>“I think the only one more unhappy than crooked Hil­lary that night was Barack Hus­sein Obama.”</p>
    <p>The Pres­i­dent ham­mered home his stan­dard pitch – the boom­ing pre-pan­demic econ­omy, law and or­der, cap­i­tal­ism and Amer­i­can val­ues ver­sus so­cial­ism and an­ar­chy.</p>
    <p>“We will stop the rad­i­cal in­doc­tri­na­tion of our stu­dents,” he pledged.</p>
    <p>The mes­sages went down well with Ms Deirdre Looney, who works for a mov­ing com­pany.</p>
    <p>Ms Looney, 28, is a Covid-19 sur­vivor. “It was aw­ful. It is real. It’s just not what peo­ple are mak­ing it out to be. We’re not be­ing told the truth about it, and that’s not Don­ald Trump’s fault,” she in­sisted, blam­ing in­stead the Cen­tres for Dis­ease Con­trol and Preven­tion and the coun­try’s top epi­demi­ol­ogy ex­pert, Dr An­thony Fauci, whose dis­agree­ments with Mr Trump have be­come more ev­i­dent.</p>
    <p>In a con­fer­ence call with cam­paign staff on Mon­day, Mr Trump called Dr Fauci “a dis­as­ter” and said that peo­ple were “tired” of hear­ing about the virus from “these id­iots” in the govern­ment.</p>
    <p>But ev­ery Trump sup­porter, in­clud­ing Ms Looney, gives the Pres­i­dent a pass.</p>
    <p>“This is a plan to ruin the econ­omy, which has hap­pened in North Carolina,” Ms Looney told The Straits Times, proudly wear­ing her “Women for Trump” para­pher­na­lia. “Half the bars down­town can’t open.”</p>
    <p>Mr Trump’s at­ti­tude also does not faze his sup­port­ers.</p>
    <p>“He knows how to get peo­ple bent out of shape,” said Mr Crow, the for­mer Marine.</p>
    <p>“He can an­swer any ques­tion and sound like he is win­ning. That’s part of be­ing a ne­go­tia­tor.</p>
    <p>“For ex­am­ple, when he says ‘12 more years’ to the crowds, ev­ery­one knows he doesn’t mean it but it gets the Democrats all riled up.”</p>
    <p>Col­lege stu­dent Ser­gio Smith, 23, told ST: “He’s been a good Pres­i­dent. I like what he did with the econ­omy. And I’m a Catholic, I’m against abor­tion.”</p>
    <p>Again and again, sup­port­ers pointed to Mr Trump not be­ing a ca­reer politi­cian as a huge plus.</p>
    <p>“He’s a busi­ness­man, he’s a cando guy,” Mr Gra­ham Pitt, a 70-yearold re­tired fi­nan­cial ad­viser, told ST. “I told my wife... we’ll never see some­thing like this again in our life­time, a politi­cian or some­one run­ning for po­lit­i­cal of­fice, like we saw tonight. The peo­ple love him, and he loves the peo­ple.”</p>
    <p>It was his third Trump rally, he said: “I’ve been on the Trump train since the get-go. He’s done ev­ery­thing he said he was go­ing to do, and then some.”</p>
    <p>UNHAPPY OUT­COME There was no­body that cam­paigned harder for crooked Hil­lary Clin­ton than Obama, right?... I think the only one more unhappy than crooked Hil­lary that night was Barack Hus­sein Obama. PRES­I­DENT DON­ALD TRUMP, on Mr Barack Obama who had sup­ported Mrs Hil­lary Clin­ton, Mr Trump’s un­suc­cess­ful ri­val in the 2016 pres­i­den­tial elec­tion.</p>
    <p>SCARE TAC­TICS All you hear is Covid, Covid. That’s all they put on be­cause they want to scare the hell out of ev­ery­one. MR TRUMP, crit­i­cis­ing the Democrats and me­dia for be­ing overly pre­oc­cu­pied with the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>RE­COV­ERY OR DEPRESSION This is an elec­tion be­tween the Trump su­per re­cov­ery, which is hap­pen­ing right now, and a Bi­den depression… If you want open schools, an open econ­omy and a safe, healthy, thriv­ing coun­try, vote for me. MR TRUMP, on the US econ­omy.</p>
