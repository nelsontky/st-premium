    <p>US Sec­re­tary of State Mike Pom­peo has warned US politi­cians at the state and lo­cal level to be vig­i­lant around Chi­nese diplo­mats whom he said could be try­ing to woo them as part of Bei­jing’s pro­pa­ganda and es­pi­onage campaign.</p>
    <p>Speak­ing at the Wis­con­sin State Capi­tol on Wed­nes­day, Mr Pom­peo said the State De­part­ment was re­view­ing the ac­tiv­i­ties of the United States-China Friend­ship As­so­ci­a­tion and the China Coun­cil for the Pro­mo­tion of Peace­ful Re­u­ni­fi­ca­tion over sus­pi­cions that they are try­ing to in­flu­ence Amer­i­can schools, busi­ness groups and lo­cal politi­cians.</p>
    <p>The two groups are linked to China’s United Front Work De­part­ment, an or­gan of the Chi­nese Com­mu­nist Party (CCP) Cen­tral Com­mit­tee, Mr Pom­peo said.</p>
    <p>“Know that when you are ap­proached by a Chi­nese diplo­mat, it is likely not in the spirit of co­op­er­a­tion or friend­ship,” he said, warning of the CCP’s “in­flu­ence and es­pi­onage cam­paigns”, even at the mu­nic­i­pal level.</p>
    <p>“The fed­eral gov­ern­ment can’t po­lice ev­ery bit of this preda­tory and co­er­cive be­hav­iour. We need your help... Pro­tect­ing Amer­i­can in­ter­ests re­quires vig­i­lance, vig­i­lance that starts with you – and all state leg­is­la­tors, re­gard­less of party,” he said.</p>
    <p>The latest swipe at Bei­jing comes in the run-up to the pres­i­den­tial elec­tion in Novem­ber, in which Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump has made a tough ap­proach to China an im­por­tant for­eign pol­icy plat­form.</p>
    <p>Wis­con­sin is a key bat­tle­ground state in the polls.</p>
    <p>Mr Pom­peo’s speech trig­gered an outcry from Demo­cratic law­mak­ers who ac­cused him of us­ing tax­payer money to so­lid­ify po­lit­i­cal sup­port for Mr Trump and, po­ten­tially, for him­self as he is widely seen as har­bour­ing pres­i­den­tial am­bi­tions for 2024.</p>
    <p>Mr Pom­peo also asked Wis­con­sin leg­is­la­tors to boost in­tel­lec­tual prop­erty pro­tec­tions and in­vest­ment screen­ing, and en­cour­aged busi­ness peo­ple to ig­nore China’s threats over en­gag­ing with Tai­wan, which Bei­jing claims as sov­er­eign Chi­nese ter­ri­tory.</p>
    <p>Ties be­tween China and the US are at their low­est point in decades, with the world’s top two economies at log­ger­heads over is­sues in­clud­ing China’s han­dling of the coronaviru­s cri­sis, trade ri­val­ries, new na­tional se­cu­rity leg­is­la­tion in Hong Kong and ten­sions in the South China Sea.</p>
    <p>Mr Pom­peo said the Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion was care­fully cal­i­brat­ing its lan­guage on how to de­scribe what has been hap­pen­ing in China’s western Xin­jiang re­gion, where the United Na­tions cites cred­i­ble re­ports as say­ing that one mil­lion Mus­lims held in camps have been put to work.</p>
    <p>“When the United States speaks about crimes against hu­man­ity or geno­cide... we’ve got to be very care­ful and very pre­cise be­cause it car­ries an enor­mous weight,” Mr Pom­peo said.</p>
    <p>Last month, the Politico news web­site re­ported that the Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion was con­sid­er­ing for­mally la­belling China’s ac­tions in Xin­jiang as a “geno­cide”.</p>
    <p>China has re­jected al­le­ga­tions of forced labour in Xin­jiang and has crit­i­cised the US for med­dling in its in­ter­nal af­fairs.</p>
