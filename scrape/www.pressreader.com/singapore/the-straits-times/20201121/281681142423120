    <p>Prime Min­is­ter Lee Hsien Loong will be at­tend­ing the Group of 20 (G-20) Riyadh Sum­mit be­ing held today and to­mor­row.</p>
    <p>The sum­mit, held vir­tu­ally this year un­der the King­dom of Saudi Ara­bia’s G-20 pres­i­dency, will be chaired by Saudi Ara­bia’s King Sal­man Bin Ab­du­laziz Al Saud.</p>
    <p>Dis­cus­sions are ex­pected to fo­cus on col­lec­tive ef­forts to over­come the Covid-19 pan­demic, re­store growth and jobs, and build an in­clu­sive, sus­tain­able and re­silient fu­ture.</p>
    <p>The G-20 com­prises 19 large ad­vanced and emerg­ing economies and the Euro­pean Union.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore has been in­vited to this year’s G-20 meet­ings as the con­vener of the Global Gov­er­nance Group (3G) – an in­for­mal coali­tion of 30 coun­tries that seeks to in­flu­ence the G-20 to take into ac­count the in­ter­ests of smaller coun­tries af­fected by its de­ci­sions.</p>
    <p>In a press state­ment yes­ter­day, the 3G called on the G-20 to sus­tain its mo­men­tum in tack­ling the pan­demic and its health, eco­nomic and so­cial im­pact.</p>
    <p>It also ex­pressed con­cern over con­tin­ued pro­tec­tion­ism and trade con­flict, which will hin­der ef­forts to­wards a strong, in­clu­sive and sus­tain­able eco­nomic re­cov­ery.</p>
    <p>“The 3G en­cour­ages all World Trade Or­gan­i­sa­tion (WTO) mem­bers to work to­gether to ex­pe­di­tiously com­plete the se­lec­tion and ap­point­ment of a new WTO di­rec­tor-gen­eral,” it said.</p>
    <p>“In ad­di­tion, the 3G com­mends ef­forts un­der­taken by the Saudi G-20 pres­i­dency to pro­mote the main­te­nance of cross-bor­der flow of vi­tal med­i­cal sup­plies, agri­cul­tural and food prod­ucts and the strength­en­ing of global sup­ply chain re­silience, in par­tic­u­lar re­it­er­at­ing the im­por­tance that any emer­gency trade mea­sures should be tar­geted, pro­por­tion­ate, trans­par­ent, tem­po­rary and con­sis­tent with WTO rules.”</p>
    <p>It also wel­comed the six-month ex­ten­sion of the G-20 Debt Ser­vice Sus­pen­sion Ini­tia­tive (DSSI) un­til June next year, which al­lows the poor­est coun­tries to sus­pend pay­ments on of­fi­cial bi­lat­eral debt so they can con­cen­trate their re­sources on fight­ing the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>In ad­di­tion to Sin­ga­pore, the six other in­vited guests are Jordan, Rwanda, Spain, Switzer­land, Viet­nam and the United Arab Emi­rates.</p>
    <p>Deputy Prime Min­is­ter Heng Swee Keat also at­tended the vir­tual G-20 Fi­nance Min­is­ters’ Meet­ing yes­ter­day, where he noted that the G-20 had helped rally a global re­sponse to the pan­demic, but there is more to be done to emerge stronger, in­clud­ing strength­en­ing coun­tries’ col­lec­tive re­silience to cope with fu­ture shocks.</p>
    <p>In a Face­book post yes­ter­day, Mr Heng said that the path to full re­cov­ery re­mains long and un­cer­tain. “We must also com­mit our­selves to har­ness­ing tech­nol­ogy and green fi­nance to build back bet­ter,” he added.</p>
