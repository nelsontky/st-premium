    <p>Sin­ga­pore’s zero-waste mas­ter­plan high­lights a tar­get of send­ing 30 per cent less waste to Se­makau Land­fill by 2030. This vi­sion re­quires ev­ery­one in Sin­ga­pore, from in­dus­tries to house­holds and in­di­vid­u­als, to work to­gether.</p>
    <p>While the Covid-19 pan­demic has changed many as­pects of our lives, our re­liance on plas­tic re­mains the same.</p>
    <p>In fact, there has been a surge in the use of plas­tic prod­ucts such as con­tain­ers, uten­sils and bags due to the rise in de­mand for food de­liv­ery and take­aways.</p>
    <p>A study found that take­away and de­liv­ery meals gen­er­ated an ad­di­tional 1,334 tonnes of plas­tic waste dur­ing the two-month cir­cuit breaker pe­riod.</p>
    <p>The en­vi­ron­men­tal im­pact of plas­tic waste should not be taken lightly, and there are some ways to tackle this.</p>
    <p>• Plas­tic con­tain­ers are hard to avoid in food de­liv­ery, but plat­forms such as GrabFood and Food­panda could of­fer in­cen­tives to en­cour­age con­sumers to opt out of re­ceiv­ing plas­tic cut­lery.</p>
    <p>For ex­am­ple, they could in­clude the cost of the cut­lery in the ini­tial price, and re­duce it by 20 cents should the cus­tomer opt not to re­quest for plas­tic cut­lery.</p>
    <p>• Su­per­mar­kets could limit the num­ber of free plas­tic bags given based on the num­ber of items pur­chased. For ex­am­ple, they can give a cus­tomer only two free bags if he pur­chases no more than 10 items, and charge for sub­se­quent plas­tic bags.</p>
    <p>Peo­ple of­ten find it trou­ble­some to take with them re­us­able con­tain­ers which would have to be cleaned af­ter each use. Food de­liv­ery plat­forms have part­nered firms such as Mu­use and BarePack to pro­vide cus­tomers with re­us­able food con­tain­ers at an af­ford­able rate. Heng Ji­ayi</p>
