    <p>LOS AN­GE­LES • Fire­fight­ers in the US Pa­cific North­west have got a help­ing hand from cooler, damp weather in their bat­tle against an ar­ray of deadly wild­fires, even as un­co­op­er­a­tive winds in South­ern Cal­i­for­nia spread an­other l and-scape-scorch­ing blaze.</p>
    <p>The weather shift on Satur­day, which fol­lowed in­ter­mit­tently heavy show­ers last Fri­day, helped more than 9,000 per­son­nel fight 29 wild­fires across Washington and Ore­gon states, in­clud­ing the River­side Fire south-east of Port­land, the US Forestry Ser­vice said.</p>
    <p>Fire­fight­ers can ex­pect an­other 5cm to 10cm of rain in the next week for coastal Ore­gon and parts of the Cas­cade Moun­tains, said Mr David Roth, a me­te­o­rol­o­gist for the National Weather Ser­vice’s Weather Pre­dic­tion Cen­tre in Col­lege Park, Mary­land. “That’ll be over the next three to seven days, which should at least help. Some­thing is bet­ter than noth­ing.”</p>
    <p>But even af­ter the rain­fall west of the Cas­cade Moun­tains, the fire was still feed­ing on long-dead veg­e­ta­tion that is abun­dant in the western wilder­ness, a fire report read.</p>
    <p>“Rain doesn’t do much to put out the fire un­less we get a lot of it,” In­ci­dent Com­man­der Alan Sin­clair said in a state­ment. “But the good news is the cool, damp weather is mod­er­at­ing fire ac­tiv­ity and giv­ing us a chance to make progress in con­tain­ment ef­forts.”</p>
    <p>The River­side Fire has burned nearly 55,847ha and is only 11 per cent con­tained.</p>
    <p>The un­usu­ally fe­ro­cious wild­fires have claimed at least eight lives in Ore­gon and one in Washington, black­en­ing 650,000ha in the two states since Labour Day and in­cin­er­at­ing sev­eral small towns.</p>
    <p>Ore­gon emer­gency man­age­ment of­fi­cials have warned that the death toll could rise as search teams scour the ru­ins of thou­sands of homes en­gulfed in flames dur­ing chaotic evac­u­a­tions early in the dis­as­ter.</p>
    <p>Thou­sands of evac­uees, par­tic­u­larly in Ore­gon, have been forced into emer­gency shel­ters, mo­bile trail­ers and ho­tel rooms.</p>
    <p>To the south, flames have charred a record 1.3 mil­lion ha in Cal­i­for­nia, killing 26 peo­ple and de­stroy­ing over 5,800 struc­tures since mid-Au­gust, said the state Depart­ment of Forestry and Fire Pro­tec­tion.</p>
    <p>A force of more than 19,000 fire­fight­ers made head­way against the 27 ma­jor blazes they have been bat­tling since last month as sear­ing tem­per­a­tures di­min­ished some­what, the depart­ment said. But at least one blaze, the Bobcat Fire in the San Gabriel Moun­tains, spread rapidly in high winds, leav­ing more than 36,826ha scorched, it added.</p>
    <p>De­spite the mod­er­at­ing tem­per­a­tures in the south, weather in the north­ern part of the state is fore­cast to re­turn to a warm, dry pat­tern, and warm­ing con­di­tions in the state early next week are ex­pected to bring el­e­vated fire dan­ger, it said.</p>
