    <p>BEI­JING • The au­thor­i­ties in Bei­jing will lower the city’s Covid-19 emer­gency re­sponse level after al­most two weeks of no new do­mes­tic coro­n­avirus in­fec­tions.</p>
    <p>The re­sponse level will be changed to 3 from 2 to­day, on a scale where 1 is the most serious, Mr Chen Bei, vice-sec­re­tary gen­eral of the mu­nic­i­pal gov­ern­ment, said at a brief­ing yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The Chi­nese cap­i­tal will also re­open pub­lic places in­clud­ing parks, mu­se­ums and li­braries, but at 50 per cent of their ac­com­mo­da­tion ca­pac­ity, Mr Chen said.</p>
    <p>The out­break that started i n mid-June in­fected at least 335 peo­ple and sparked fears of a sec­ond wave in China, but ended up be­ing con­tained rel­a­tively quickly in less than 30 days.</p>
    <p>Although the city of over 20 mil­lion was never fully locked down like Wuhan, where the virus first emerged, ac­tiv­ity has dipped sig­nif­i­cantly since the out­break.</p>
    <p>Cul­tural per­for­mances, ex­hi­bi­tions and sports events will grad­u­ally re­sume but with ca­pac­ity lim­its upon au­thor­i­ties’ re­view, Mr Chen said.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, China is re-open­ing cin­e­mas to­day and other venues that had been shut, such as gyms, are ex­pected to fol­low. Schools are closed for sum­mer vacation but should now re-open as sched­uled on Sept 1.</p>
    <p>“It takes two weeks for zero new cases to sus­tain be­fore we can con­clude that lo­cal cases will not lead to re­cur­rent cases,” Dr Wu Zun­you, the chief epi­demi­ol­o­gist at China’s Cen­tre for Disease Con­trol and Preven­tion, had told state me­dia last month.</p>
    <p>The con­tain­ment of the resur­gence in its po­lit­i­cal and cul­tural cen­tre is a boost to China’s con­fi­dence in the fight against the pan­demic, as other cities in the re­gion in­clud­ing Hong Kong and Tokyo strug­gle with new waves.</p>
    <p>How­ever, the coro­n­avirus is reap­pear­ing in other parts of the coun­try, un­der­scor­ing the chal­lenges ahead. Last Fri­day, of­fi­cials halted sub­way ser­vice and locked down hous­ing com­pounds in Urumqi, the cap­i­tal city of western Xin­jiang prov­ince, after six in­fec­tions were re­ported, along with 11 asymp­to­matic cases.</p>
    <p>As of early yes­ter­day, the num­ber re­ported had in­creased to 30 con­firmed cases and 41 asymp­to­matic car­ri­ers.</p>
    <p>China has also an­nounced that it has de­tected the virus on the pack­ag­ing of im­ported shrimp in a num­ber of prov­inces, rais­ing alarm that the pathogen can spread through the global food trade.</p>
    <p>But the au­thor­i­ties said that there is no ev­i­dence the traces of virus found can be in­fec­tious.</p>
    <p>At least this num­ber of peo­ple in Bei­jing were in­fected dur­ing the coro­n­avirus out­break that started in mid-June. It ended up be­ing con­tained rel­a­tively quickly in less than 30 days.</p>
