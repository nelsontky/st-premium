    <p>SPEECH­LESS: When Star Wars icon Mark Hamill (above) made a sur­prise ap­pear­ance in the sea­son two fi­nale of The Man­dalo­rian, he did not ex­pect such an out­pour­ing of fan ap­pre­ci­a­tion for the re­turn of his char­ac­ter Luke Sky­walker.</p>
    <p>He said he was ren­dered speech­less by praise from ac­tor Ming-Na Wen, who played Fen­nec Shand in four episodes of sea­son two, which ended in mid-last month.</p>
    <p>In a tweet last Thurs­day, he said he was over­whelmed by fans’ re­ac­tions: “#NoWords – See­ing fans’ re­ac­tions to Luke’s re­turn is some­thing I will cher­ish for­ever.”</p>
    <p>He added: “I’m a fan my­self, so I knew true fans would love it, but to see them thrilled beyond be­lief with the ex­u­ber­ance of chil­dren, whoop­ing it up, scream­ing in ec­stasy, the tears of sheer joy… it’s a roller­coaster of emo­tions I’ll never for­get.”</p>
    <p>Then Wen tweeted some heart­felt words back at Hamill: “You (& Luke) have been im­mensely in­spi­ra­tional & impactful to my child­hood & as an adult.</p>
    <p>“To have shared a scene with you in @TheMan­dalo­rian is truly one of the big­gest high­lights, not just in my ca­reer, but in my life. Thank you.”</p>
    <p>Hamill then re­sponded: “So this hap­pened & I’m lit­er­ally speech­less, other than to say: the plea­sure was all mine @MingNa!”</p>
    <p>The in­ter­ac­tion be­tween the new and old gen­er­a­tions of the Star Wars fran­chise re­flects its en­dur­ing pop­u­lar­ity and the hold it still re­tains on fans.</p>
    <p>Dis­ney is plan­ning to con­tinue ex­pand­ing the uni­verse with 10 new se­ries. It has an­nounced that Wen will also ap­pear in the up­com­ing se­ries The Book Of Boba Fett and Star Wars: The Bad Batch.</p>
    <p>In re­sponse to Hamill’s tweet on Sun­day, Wen gushed: “I’ve reached nerd nir­vana. Gotta say, this is way cooler than the time Steven Tyler spilled red wine on my arm and wiped it off with cock­tail nap­kins at a party.”</p>
