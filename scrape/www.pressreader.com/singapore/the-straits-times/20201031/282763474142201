    <p>• Paris Saint-Ger­main pres­i­dent Nasser Al-Khe­laifi was yes­ter­day ac­quit­ted by a Swiss court of cor­rup­tion over the al­lo­ca­tion of World Cup TV rights, while for­mer Fifa sec­re­tary gen­eral Jerome Val­cke was handed a sus­pended sen­tence for a sec­ondary charge.</p>
    <p>The two men were accused of a “cor­rupt agree­ment” af­ter Val­cke al­legedly sought the help of Al-Khe­laifi, the chair­man of beIN Sports, to buy a lux­ury villa in Italy.</p>
    <p>It came at a time when the Qatari-owned broad­caster was ne­go­ti­at­ing the ex­ten­sion of its me­dia rights in North Africa and the Mid­dle East for the 2026 and 2030 World Cups.</p>
    <p>Swiss pros­e­cu­tors said Al-Khe­laifi ac­quired the house for €5 mil­lion (S$7.9 mil­lion), via a com­pany that was trans­ferred al­most im­me­di­ately to the brother of one of his close col­lab­o­ra­tors, be­fore it was made avail­able to Val­cke.</p>
    <p>They added that Val­cke com­mit­ted to “do what was in his power” to en­sure beIN would win the con­tract and should have de­clared the Villa Bianca deal to his em­ploy­ers.</p>
    <p>How­ever, the duo de­nied there was a “cor­rupt agree­ment”, claim­ing the deal was a “pri­vate” ar­range­ment, un­re­lated to the con­tract con­cluded by beIN with Fifa in April 2014 and the judge agreed with their de­fence.</p>
    <p>Pros­e­cu­tors had called for a jail term of three years for Val­cke and a 28-month sen­tence for Al-Khe­laifi fol­low­ing 10 days of hear­ings at the Swiss Fed­eral Crim­i­nal Court of Bellinzona last month.</p>
    <p>But Al-Khe­laifi, who is a min­is­ter in Qatar’s govern­ment and a mem­ber of the Uefa ex­ec­u­tive com­mit</p>
    <p>PSG pres­i­dent Nasser Al-Khe­laifi (left) was ac­quit­ted, while Jerome was handed a sus­pended sen­tence for a sec­ondary charge in the World Cup TV rights trial. tee, was yes­ter­day cleared of ag­gra­vated crim­i­nal mis­man­age­ment.</p>
    <p>French­man Val­cke was given a 120-day sus­pended sen­tence de­spite be­ing found guilty of a sep­a­rate charge of forg­ing doc­u­ments re­lated to the at­tri­bu­tion of Ital­ian and Greek World Cup TV rights. He was or­dered to pay Fifa €1.75 mil­lion in resti­tu­tion.</p>
    <p>A third de­fen­dant, Greek busi­ness­man Di­nos Deris, was also cleared of charges of ac­tive cor­rup­tion with Val­cke and in­cit­ing him.</p>
    <p>In a state­ment, Al-Khe­laifi said: “Af­ter a re­lent­less four-year cam­paign against me that ig­nored the ba­sic facts and the law at ev­ery turn, I have fi­nally, fully and com­pletely cleared my name. To­day’s ver­dict is a to­tal vin­di­ca­tion.</p>
    <p>“It re­stores my faith in the rule of law and in due process, af­ter four years of base­less al­le­ga­tions, fic­ti­tious charges and con­stant smears of my rep­u­ta­tion – all of which have been proven to be com­pletely and wholly un­sub­stan­ti­ated.”</p>
    <p>This was the first judg­ment handed down in Switzer­land, the seat of most in­ter­na­tional sports or­gan­i­sa­tions, in the 20 or so pro­ceed­ings opened in the last five years in­volv­ing Fifa.</p>
    <p>Two for­mer South Amer­i­can foot­ball heads have al­ready been jailed in the United States as part of the on­go­ing “Fifa-gate” scan­dal.</p>
