    <p>SAN FRAN­CISCO • Coin­base Global, the big­gest United States cryp­tocur­rency ex­change, said it has filed con­fi­den­tially with the Se­cu­ri­ties and Ex­change Com­mis­sion (SEC) to go pub­lic in what is an­tic­i­pated to be a break­through mo­ment for the industry.</p>
    <p>The San Fran­cisco-based com­pany said in a state­ment that it ex­pects its draft reg­is­tra­tion fil­ing to be­come ef­fec­tive af­ter the SEC com­pletes its re­view process. The com­pany did not pro­vide fur­ther de­tails of its list­ing plans and a rep­re­sen­ta­tive de­clined to com­ment be­yond the an­nounce­ment.</p>
    <p>Coin­base was val­ued at more than US$8 bil­lion (S$10.6 bil­lion) in 2018 af­ter a US$300 mil­lion fund­ing round led by Tiger Global Man­age­ment.</p>
    <p>The com­pany, started in 2012, has raised more than US$500 mil­lion from back­ers that also in­clude An­dreessen Horowitz, Y Com­bi­na­tor and Grey­lock Part­ners, ac­cord­ing to its web­site.</p>
    <p>Coin­base said it has more than 35 mil­lion ver­i­fied users in more than 100 coun­tries and more than US$25 bil­lion in as­sets on its plat­form.</p>
    <p>Mr Kyle Sa­mani, co-founder of Mul­tiCoin Cap­i­tal, said he ex­pects Coin­base go­ing pub­lic to be a “huge event” for the industry.</p>
    <p>“It is a water­shed mo­ment for the as­set class, both as a form of le­git­imi­sa­tion, and by pro­vid­ing a way for in­vestors to bet on the crypto industry with­out bet­ting on a spe­cific as­set,” said Mr Sa­mani, who is an in­vestor in Coin­base.</p>
    <p>Bit­coin hit an all-time high on Thurs­day of more than US$23,000, and has more than dou­bled this year.</p>
    <p>Pay­Pal Hold­ings has be­gun let­ting con­sumers use the cryp­tocur­rency in trans­ac­tions, and com­pa­nies in­clud­ing Square and Mi­croS­trat­egy have made bit­coin in­vest­ments, prompt­ing spec­u­la­tions that more in­sti­tu­tional in­vestors will jump into cryp­tocur­ren­cies.</p>
    <p>One River As­set Man­age­ment, a hedge fund spe­cial­is­ing in volatil­ity bets, has qui­etly bought US$600 mil­lion worth of the dig­i­tal cur­rency, Bloomberg re­ported.</p>
    <p>As cryp­tocur­rency prices have risen, Coin­base has ex­pe­ri­enced per­for­mance is­sues this week, in­clud­ing con­nec­tiv­ity prob­lems and de­lays.</p>
    <p>A Coin­base list­ing would be “a ma­jor exit for many early em­ploy­ees”, said Mr Nic Carter, co­founder of crypto re­searcher Coin Met­rics. Those em­ploy­ees would have liq­uid­ity for an­gel in­vest­ments and the means to start their own start-ups, Mr Carter said.</p>
    <p>Sev­eral cryp­tocur­rency-re­lated com­pa­nies, par­tic­u­larly ex­changes, are al­ready earn­ing hun­dreds of mil­lions or even bil­lions in an­nual rev­enue, and more crypto start-ups are ex­pected to go pub­lic or be ac­quired in the com­ing months.</p>
