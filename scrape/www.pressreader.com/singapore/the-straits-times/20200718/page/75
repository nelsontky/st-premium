        C23 | SATURDAY, JULY 18 , 2020 CAREERS IN EDUCATION SECTOR                                                                                                                                       Teaching from the heart BY RATNA RAMLI S he teaches English and Mathematic­s to lower primary students at CHIJ Kellock, whom she credits for fuelling her courage and passion to teach and nurture.
Ms Abirami Archunan, 31, believes in embracing each child’s individual­ity and that it is her responsibi­lity as an educator to hone their potential and develop their strengths.
She says: “Taking a holistic perspectiv­e allows me to look into each student’s individual potential across intellectu­al, physical, social, emotional and creative aspects. We need to recognise their strengths and weaknesses as individual­s rather than try to fit them into a collective majority.”
As an educator, she tries to seize each moment to teach her students something of value, and help them resolve issues and challenges they face beyond their textbooks and classrooms.
She explains: “Students do not just remember what you teach in the classroom — they remember how authentic you are with them and whether they feel connected to you. As educators, we need to make them feel capable and respected. The connection­s we build with them will help them make sense of the world and persist through challenges.”
Ms Abirami believes in ensuring that these connection­s are positive.
She says: “The courage to teach lies in keeping one’s heart open for connection­s. When teachers connect with their students, we get to know them beyond their academic progress, creating a deeper bond of care and compassion. This will be the change that will really help our children.” The CHIJ Kellock teacher was one of the recipients of the Outstandin­g Youth in Education Award (OYEA) in 2019.                                                                                                                                                                               , teacher, CHIJ Kellock                                    Her passion for her vocation has not gone unnoticed. In 2019, she was awarded the Outstandin­g Youth in Education Award (OYEA). The national award honours the achievemen­ts of young educators like her who have the passion and commitment to teach, inspire and nurture their students. OYEA recognises their youthful idealism, enthusiasm, energy and active involvemen­t in the developmen­t of youth beyond the formal curriculum.
On her achievemen­ts, Ms Abirami says: “While I am humbled by the award and recognitio­n for my ‘heart’ work, I still have a lot to learn as an educator and I hope to continue the spirit of learning throughout my teaching journey.” Executive Appointmen­ts PICO GUARDS PTE LTD Islandwide, Permanent Day/ Night Shift Flexible Roster up to up to up to (5 days work week) up to 2700* 3200* 3600* 2400* Security officer
