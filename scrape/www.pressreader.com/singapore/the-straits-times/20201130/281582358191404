    <p>China’s drive to be­come a global leader in cli­mate is­sues and green tech­nol­ogy will have a com­peti­tor in the United States, which is back in the race with Pres­i­dent-elect Joe Bi­den in­tent on re­build­ing the coun­try’s cli­mate leadership. At stake is the green tech sec­tor and the planet’s health, says China cor­re­spon­dent Dan­son Cheong.</p>
    <p>Wuhai, a tiny city of just over half a mil­lion peo­ple in In­ner Mon­go­lia, is coal coun­try.</p>
    <p>Grow­ing up there, Dr Yang Yingxia re­mem­bers the hills dot­ted with coal mines, and how her friends would set off for the coun­try seek­ing to make their for­tunes from the black gold be­neath the ground.</p>
    <p>“They got rich overnight, you could go out to the moun­tains, dig a hole, get the coal out and be­come rich. It was easy like that,” said Dr Yang, a se­nior fel­low at the Bos­ton Univer­sity In­sti­tute for Sus­tain­able En­ergy, il­lus­trat­ing how the for­tunes of cities like Wuhai were tied to coal.</p>
    <p>In the noughties, when China’s econ­omy took off, de­mand soared for cheap elec­tric­ity and coal, and Wuhai’s for­tunes rose, clock­ing dou­ble-digit gross do­mes­tic prod­uct growth from 2000 to 2012. The rapid in­dus­trial growth left its mark – strip-min­ing scarred the land while dirty coke fac­to­ries spewed smog into the skies.</p>
    <p>But to­day, Wuhai looks dif­fer­ent. The lo­cal gov­ern­ment has greened the hills and moun­tains, and shut down highly pol­lut­ing plants, said Dr Yang, who wrote about the lit­tle-known city for en­ergy pol­icy jour­nal Ox­ford En­ergy Fo­rum in Septem­ber.</p>
    <p>The city’s econ­omy is more di­ver­si­fied than be­fore – with a nascent hy­dro­gen in­dus­try, and re­new­able wind and so­lar en­ergy, plus a grow­ing tourism and wine in­dus­try.</p>
    <p>It is per­haps a pic­ture of the sort of trans­for­ma­tion that must start to take place if China is to wean it­self off coal.</p>
    <p>Whether or not it can do this has be­come not just a do­mes­tic is­sue, but also a key cog in its big­ger plan to be a global leader in cli­mate ef­forts and green tech­nol­ogy.</p>
    <p>Bei­jing has laid out am­bi­tious goals. In Septem­ber, Chi­nese Pres­i­dent Xi Jin­ping de­clared at the United Na­tions Gen­eral Assem­bly that the coun­try was aim­ing to hit peak car­bon emis­sions by 2030 and be­come car­bon neu­tral be­fore 2060 – the first time the world’s top emit­ter of green­house gases has laid out a long-term tra­jec­tory for its de­car­bon­i­sa­tion.</p>
    <p>China’s drive to be­come a global leader in cli­mate is­sues and green tech­nol­ogy will have a com­peti­tor in the United States now that the Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion is on its way out. Pres­i­dent-elect Joe Bi­den is in­tent on re­build­ing Amer­ica’s cli­mate leadership and will ap­point for­mer sec­re­tary of state John</p>
    <p>Kerry as its cli­mate czar.</p>
    <p>Cli­mate ex­perts are now watch­ing closely if Bei­jing’s ac­tions will match its words, and whether it will co­op­er­ate with Wash­ing­ton on what is the most press­ing is­sue of our time.</p>
    <p>COAL AD­DIC­TION</p>
    <p>Much of the cli­mate de­bate in China has re­volved around coal – it is the world’s largest con­sumer of the fos­sil fuel, burn­ing 3.83 bil­lion tonnes last year, about half the world’s to­tal.</p>
    <p>By far the most car­bon-in­ten­sive fos­sil fuel, coal has pow­ered decades of China’s eco­nomic growth but be­fouled its en­vi­ron­ment at the same time, leav­ing cities blan­keted in smog.</p>
    <p>Ris­ing pub­lic un­hap­pi­ness about pol­lu­tion led Bei­jing to clean up its act in 2013, but it has had a spotty record.</p>
    <p>China cur­rently has about</p>
    <p>130 gi­gawatts (GW) of ex­cess coal-fired en­ergy pro­duc­tion ca­pac­ity out of its to­tal of 1,100GW, but still plans to add more, ac­cord­ing to a re­port this month by the Dra­world En­vi­ron­ment Re­search Cen­tre and Helsinki-based</p>
    <p>Cen­tre for Re­search on En­ergy and</p>
    <p>Clean Air (Crea).</p>
    <p>China wants to in­crease this en­ergy ca­pac­ity from coal to 1,300GW by 2030, but re­searchers ar­gue that Bei­jing should in­stead move in the op­po­site di­rec­tion to re­duce this to 680GW, and put a mora­to­rium on new plants while phas­ing out ex­ist­ing ones.</p>
    <p>Far from us­ing Covid-19 as an op­por­tu­nity for a “green re­cov­ery”, and a chance to boost in­vest­ments in clean en­ergy and low-car­bon tech­nolo­gies to spur growth, cli­mate ex­perts say lo­cal gov­ern­ments, squeezed by a slow­ing econ­omy, are fall­ing back on their old playbook of in­vest­ing in fos­sil fuel-heavy de­vel­op­ments.</p>
    <p>This is “not in the coun­try’s long-term en­vi­ron­men­tal and eco­nomic in­ter­ests”, said Green­peace East Asia se­nior global pol­icy ad­viser Li Shuo, adding that it should be im­me­di­ately halted.</p>
    <p>“One way to do that is to in­tro­duce a strin­gent cap for coal con­sump­tion and coal-fired power plant in­stal­la­tions in the next five-year plan,” he said, re­fer­ring to China’s five-year de­vel­op­ment blue­print that is cur­rently be­ing drafted.</p>
    <p>It can seem like a bit of a para­dox that China con­tin­ues to build more coal plants while pro­fess­ing its green am­bi­tions, but Ad­junct As­so­ciate Pro­fes­sor Jack­son Ewing, a se­nior fel­low at Duke Univer­sity’s Ni­cholas In­sti­tute for En­vi­ron­men­tal Pol­icy So­lu­tions, points out that the “forces be­hind con­tin­u­ing coal use are en­trenched”.</p>
    <p>Bei­jing con­tin­ues to lean to­wards coal as a se­cure and sta­ble source of en­ergy and of em­ploy­ment. But this is per­haps where the ex­am­ple of cities like Wuhai come in.</p>
    <p>In her Ox­ford En­ergy Fo­rum ar­ti­cle, Dr Yang wrote that help­ing coal re­gions “de­cou­ple their economies from coal” will help them avoid sud­den eco­nomic shocks from re­duced coal de­mand. In­vest­ing in re­new­ables, emerg­ing tech­nolo­gies like hy­dro­gen power and in­dus­tries like tourism will pro­vide “al­ter­na­tive driv­ers for growth”, she said.</p>
    <p>“The changes there give me hope that they are open to try­ing some­thing new, some­thing dif­fer­ent from coal. All of those are im­por­tant steps to­wards the right di­rec­tion.”</p>
    <p>GREEN TRANS­FOR­MA­TION</p>
    <p>Spurring on this green trans­for­ma­tion across China was likely the main in­tent be­hind Mr Xi’s un­ex­pected car­bon neu­tral­ity an­nounce­ment in Septem­ber.</p>
    <p>While it was a po­lit­i­cally savvy move that gen­er­ated much-needed mo­men­tum in the global fight against cli­mate change, it also showed his am­bi­tion for China to lead this new green global econ­omy. As cli­mate change be­comes a big­ger part of the global agenda, re­new­able and clean en­ergy tech­nolo­gies are go­ing to be­come in­creas­ingly im­por­tant.</p>
    <p>En­sur­ing that China can be at the fore­front of this green wave is the main driver of Bei­jing’s cli­mate pol­icy, said Prof Ewing.</p>
    <p>“Chi­nese lead­ers see the coun­try’s cli­mate pol­icy as a driver of wider struc­tural changes that will abate pol­lu­tion, drive wealth cre­ation and im­prove the over­all qual­ity of life for its cit­i­zens,” he added.</p>
    <p>Cli­mate ex­perts have, in re­cent weeks, pointed out that meet­ing Mr Xi’s goals would re­quire a mas­sive scale-up in in­vest­ments in re­new­able en­ergy and other clean, low-car­bon tech­nolo­gies.</p>
    <p>The Dra­world and Crea re­port, for in­stance, says China needs to dou­ble its growth of wind and so­lar en­ergy over the next decade.</p>
    <p>A road map laid out by Ts­inghua Univer­sity’s In­sti­tute of En­ergy, En­vi­ron­ment and Econ­omy, which works closely with the Min­istry of Ecol­ogy and En­vi­ron­ment, points to a ten­fold in­crease in China’s so­lar power ca­pac­ity, and a sev­en­fold rise in wind and nuclear power by 2050.</p>
    <p>It is in­creas­ingly clear that China wants to po­si­tion it­self as a global leader in these tech­nolo­gies and oth­ers, like car­bon stor­age and cap­ture, that will be re­quired to help hu­man­ity meet this global chal­lenge.</p>
    <p>Al­ready, Bei­jing leads the world in many key tech­nolo­gies re­quired to fight cli­mate change. It is the world’s largest pro­ducer of so­lar pan­els, wind tur­bines, bat­ter­ies and elec­tric ve­hi­cles.</p>
    <p>Cheap so­lar pan­els from Chi­nese firms have al­ready low­ered the cost of adopt­ing so­lar power around the world, pric­ing out Amer­i­can and Euro­pean panel-mak­ers in the process.</p>
    <p>Now, Bei­jing is bet­ting on emerg­ing hy­dro­gen fuel cell tech­nol­ogy.</p>
    <p>This month, the State Coun­cil re­leased a 15-year plan for new-en­ergy ve­hi­cles (NEV) that called for build­ing up fuel-cell sup­ply chains and de­vel­op­ing hy­dro­gen-pow­ered buses and trucks.</p>
    <p>Bei­jing wants NEV sales to make up a fifth of all new car sales by 2025, from just 5 per cent cur­rently – and will use sub­si­dies and other in­cen­tives to spur growth in this area.</p>
    <p>In­dus­try ex­perts have noted that this could push China ahead in NEV de­vel­op­ment and other ar­eas, muscling out US firms in the process, even as Mr Bi­den tries to fos­ter Amer­i­can ca­pa­bil­i­ties in these ar­eas.</p>
    <p>The question some are ask­ing is whether cli­mate change would be­come a new arena of com­pe­ti­tion be­tween the two su­per­pow­ers.</p>
    <p>Un­like the cur­rent US ad­min­is­tra­tion, Mr Bi­den has pledged to take cli­mate change se­ri­ously. For in­stance, he has said the US would re­join the Paris Agree­ment on his first day in power, re­vers­ing a de­ci­sion made by Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump.</p>
    <p>Some are hop­ing that be­cause the in­ter­ests of both coun­tries are aligned, that cli­mate change could be­come a plat­form for co­op­er­a­tion be­tween the world’s top two emit­ters.</p>
    <p>But some like Mr Li feel a re­turn to the Xi-Obama era of close cli­mate co­op­er­a­tion is un­likely.</p>
    <p>Un­der those two lead­ers, both coun­tries struck a bi­lat­eral deal to re­duce emis­sions in 2014, which cre­ated im­mense mo­men­tum for the Paris Agree­ment two years later.</p>
    <p>But bi­lat­eral ties have sunk to their low­est level in decades, and trust, a nec­es­sary pre­req­ui­site for close co­op­er­a­tion, is lack­ing.</p>
    <p>Trust is a cru­cial in­gre­di­ent – in the run-up to the Paris Agree­ment, then Pres­i­dent Barack Obama’s Spe­cial En­voy for Cli­mate Change Todd Stern met his Chi­nese coun­ter­part Xie Zhen­hua al­most ev­ery month for six years, a for­mer state depart­ment of­fi­cial re­cently re­vealed in an on­line dis­cus­sion on cli­mate.</p>
    <p>In­stead, what could hap­pen is what Mr Li calls a “low-car­bon” en­ergy race, as both sides jos­tle for global leadership and com­pete to de­velop tech­nolo­gies in this emerg­ing area.</p>
    <p>That might not be a bad thing, as long as both sides re­main fo­cused on tack­ling this global chal­lenge in­stead of at­tack­ing each other.</p>
    <p>Mr Li summed it up best: “In the end, the en­emy is not a par­tic­u­lar coun­try – the com­mon en­emy of all coun­tries is the chal­lenge of cli­mate change it­self.”</p>
