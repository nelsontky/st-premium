    <p>From Mon­day, all trav­ellers en­ter­ing Sin­ga­pore with travel his­tory to Hong Kong in the pre­vi­ous two weeks must serve a 14-day stay-home no­tice (SHN) at ded­i­cated fa­cil­i­ties.</p>
    <p>But they are al­lowed to opt out of serv­ing the no­tice at ded­i­cated fa­cil­i­ties if they are oc­cu­py­ing their place of res­i­dence alone, or with house­hold mem­bers with the same travel his­tory and SHN du­ra­tion.</p>
    <p>They must also not have trav­elled to any other place in the last two weeks ex­cept Fiji, South Korea, Sri Lanka, Thai­land, Hong Kong, Aus­tralia, Brunei, Ma­cau, China, New Zealand, Tai­wan and Viet­nam.</p>
    <p>The new re­quire­ment is stricter than the cur­rent one, where trav­ellers from Hong Kong are al­lowed to serve a seven-day SHN at their place of res­i­dence.</p>
    <p>The new re­stric­tion kicks in from 11.59pm on Sun­day, said the Ministry of Health (MOH) last night.</p>
    <p>Ad­di­tion­ally, from 11.59pm next Fri­day, all trav­ellers en­ter­ing Sin­ga­pore – ex­cept Sin­ga­pore cit­i­zens and per­ma­nent res­i­dents –</p>
    <p>who have travel his­tory to Hong Kong in the past two weeks must take a Covid-19 poly­merase chain re­ac­tion test within 72 hours be­fore de­par­ture to the Repub­lic. They will need to present a valid neg­a­tive Covid-19 test to en­ter Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>The ministry ex­plained that the multi-ministry task force look­ing into Covid-19 has been closely mon­i­tor­ing the global Covid-19 sit­u­a­tion, and will be tight­en­ing bor­der measures due to the de­te­ri­o­rat­ing</p>
    <p>out­break sit­u­a­tion in Hong Kong.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, there were eight new coro­n­avirus cases con­firmed yes­ter­day, tak­ing Sin­ga­pore’s to­tal to 58,305.</p>
    <p>One of the new cases was from a work­ers’ dor­mi­tory, and there was none in the com­mu­nity. The last time there was a case from a work­ers’ dor­mi­tory was on Dec 3.</p>
    <p>The case from the work­ers’ dor­mi­tory re­ported yes­ter­day was asymp­to­matic and he was de­tected through the ministry’s</p>
    <p>proac­tive sur­veil­lance. His close con­tacts at his dor­mi­tory and work­place have been quar­an­tined.</p>
    <p>The re­main­ing seven new cases were im­ported and had been placed on SHNs or iso­lated on ar­rival in Sin­ga­pore, said the ministry.</p>
    <p>They in­clude three Sin­ga­pore­ans aged be­tween 19 and 52.</p>
    <p>Two of them, who re­turned from Bri­tain and United Arab Emi­rates, were asymp­to­matic while the third, who came back from In­done­sia, showed symp­toms on Dec 5.</p>
    <p>The rest of the im­ported cases were two work per­mit hold­ers, a de­pen­dant’s pass holder and a short-term visit pass holder. They ar­rived from the Philip­pines, Bri­tain, Malaysia and In­dia.</p>
    <p>MOH said the num­ber of new cases in the com­mu­nity has re­mained low, with just one case in the past week, which was linked to a pre­vi­ous case.</p>
