    <p>Like self-im­prove­ment books, the pur­pose of pen­sion ad­e­quacy sur­veys is to make us feel lousy about our­selves. Lousy and scared: We haven’t saved enough be­cause we’re my­opic and lack self-con­trol.</p>
    <p>We don’t have a re­tire­ment plan, and it’s get­ting late. That next av­o­cado toast may deny our fu­ture selves a pair of read­ing glasses. At the back of our minds, there’s al­ways the guilt that we should be leav­ing some­thing – ac­tu­ally, a lot – to our chil­dren.</p>
    <p>Yet, af­ter you throw in the be­quest mo­tive, the av­o­cado toast is truly toast. So per­haps we shouldn’t bother hav­ing chil­dren?</p>
    <p>Think about it: If our ra­tio­nal­ity wasn’t bounded, if we weren’t so con­di­tioned to en­joy the present, if we could all do the prob­a­bil­ity and pay­off maths for ev­ery sit­u­a­tion, and dis­count fu­ture util­ity cor­rectly, would any of us ever walk out with­out an um­brella or fall in love? But we do, and will.</p>
    <p>So why should our ap­proach to money be any dif­fer­ent?</p>
    <p>Global life ex­pectancy went up by five years be­tween 2010 and 2015, the fastest in­crease since the 1960s. A post-pan­demic boost to health­care in­vest­ment may make us all live longer, on av­er­age. Don’t be sur­prised if those re­tir­ing in 2035 need an ex­tra five years or more of fu­ture in­come be­cause of longevity alone. Where will that money come from in a low-yield en­vi­ron­ment? The most ob­vi­ous an­swer is that re­tire­ment will keep get­ting post­poned.</p>
    <p>The other strat­egy may be a nat­u­ral by-prod­uct of des­per­a­tion. The nest egg promised by the su­per­an­nu­a­tion in­dus­try will sel­dom prove suf­fi­cient af­ter pay­ing fund man­agers’ ex­or­bi­tant fees. Near­ing the end of their work­ing lives, savers will buy riskier prod­ucts.</p>
    <p>A Fidelity In­ter­na­tional sur­vey shows that 48 per cent of younger Hong Kong res­i­dents al­lo­cate 25 per cent or less of their sav­ings to equities, while 22 per cent of older work­ers have at least 75 per cent of their hold­ings in stocks or shares.</p>
    <p>There’s a third trick, and most Asian cul­tures know it. Kobe Univer­sity econ­o­mist Charles Yuji Ho­rioka is a scholar of our de­sire to fi­nan­cially en­rich our prog­eny. In Jan­uary, he co-au­thored a pa­per high­light­ing the dif­fer­ence be­tween those Ja­panese who want to leave a legacy for al­tru­is­tic rea­sons, and those who use it strate­gi­cally to ex­er­cise in­ter-gen­er­a­tional lever­age.</p>
    <p>The for­mer will work both harder and longer, while those who want to be looked af­ter by their chil­dren in old age will put in longer hours, but re­tire early to max­imise the care they re­ceive. They will work harder, not longer.</p>
    <p>Asians nat­u­rally don’t want to die work­ing, and many so­ci­eties have some form of non-fam­ily safety net. Ja­pan has a pub­lic longterm care in­sur­ance. In South Korea, Tai­wan, Sin­ga­pore, Hong Kong and Malaysia, re­tirees ex­pect the govern­ment to play a role in en­sur­ing in­come se­cu­rity.</p>
    <p>Yet Asians know it’s not enough. Dr Ho­rioka’s own past re­search has shown the Ja­panese and Chi­nese have a strong be­quest mo­tive. In­di­ans have an even keener wish. Given the coun­try’s youth­ful de­mo­graph­ics, con­strained state fi­nances and un­der­de­vel­oped pen­sion mar­kets, even lim­ited fi­nan­cial as­sis­tance for the el­derly may have to be “pur­chased” by them from the next gen­er­a­tion.</p>
    <p>Per­haps In­di­ans are al­ready strate­gic with their be­quest mo­tive. They aren’t post­pon­ing the act of giv­ing to their fi­nal years. They are do­ing it now.</p>
    <p>One of the world’s hottest ed­u­ca­tion tech­nol­ogy uni­corns is Byju’s, an In­dian on­line tu­tor­ing com­pany val­ued at US$11 bil­lion (S$15 bil­lion) af­ter its last fi­nanc­ing round. Ban­ga­lore-based Byju’s re­cently paid US$300 mil­lion to ac­quire Mum­bai-based WhiteHat Jr, which teaches cod­ing to chil­dren.</p>
    <p>For US$3,999, WhiteHat prom­ises chil­dren younger than 14 ex­po­sure to “full com­mer­cial-ready util­ity apps”. So this is a form of early be­quest. If ju­nior hits upon the idea for the next Face­book or Uber, the par­ents can re­tire to­day. Oth­er­wise, the child can al­ways go work in Sil­i­con Val­ley and send money home, grate­ful for a timely US$3,999 in­vest­ment the par­ents couldn’t re­ally af­ford. In ei­ther sce­nario, there won’t be a need to give much more on one’s deathbed.</p>
    <p>Glar­ing wealth in­equal­ity makes it risky to be­queath any­thing more than the fam­ily pet in the will. As econ­o­mists Thomas Piketty and Em­manuel Saez have force­fully ar­gued, in­her­i­tance taxes should be 50 per cent to 60 per cent, and even higher for big­ger be­quests. So the choice is ei­ther to spend the money on one’s own bet­ter­ment, or to give it early to the off­spring.</p>
    <p>To­day’s work­ers can use the money. They can reskill them­selves. But spend­ing the same sum on teenagers’ ed­u­ca­tion may of­fer su­pe­rior re­turns.</p>
    <p>That’s the re­tire­ment plan many strug­gling mid­dle-class peo­ple ev­ery­where are on. They just for­got to tell the wealth man­ager, who’s still shak­ing his head about how lit­tle clients are sav­ing.</p>
