    <p>Mr Yoshi­hide Suga, who was sworn in as Ja­pan’s 99th Prime Min­is­ter yes­ter­day, pledged to fur­ther the poli­cies un­der­taken by pre­de­ces­sor Shinzo Abe and to re­duce bu­reau­cratic in­ef­fi­cien­cies.</p>
    <p>Mr Suga, 71, has been one of Mr Abe’s most trusted al­lies as Chief Cab­i­net Sec­re­tary since De­cem­ber 2012, fronting 3,213 gov­ern­ment news con­fer­ences and de­fend­ing him through thick and thin even at the height of scan­dals.</p>
    <p>The power change at the peak of Na­gat­a­cho, Ja­pan’s po­lit­i­cal epi­cen­tre, comes after Mr Abe, who turns 66 on Mon­day, abruptly quit last month over a chronic health con­di­tion.</p>
    <p>Mr Suga’s gov­ern­ment was sworn in by Em­peror Naruhito yes­ter­day and, at his first news con­fer­ence as Prime Min­is­ter last night, said: “Pol­i­tics can­not tol­er­ate a vac­uum.”</p>
    <p>He vowed to over­come the Covid-19 cri­sis and said he will con­tinue with poli­cies like Abe­nomics – fis­cal spend­ing, mon­e­tary eas­ing and struc­tural re­forms – and push for re­forms in ar­eas such as bu­reau­cratic sec­tion­al­ism.</p>
    <p>While Mr Suga is lack­ing in di­plo­matic ex­pe­ri­ence, he said last night that he will pur­sue Abe-era ob­jec­tives in­clud­ing the free and open Indo-Pa­cific pol­icy. He also sees as “his high­est pri­or­ity” a res­o­lu­tion of the North Korean ab­duc­tion is­sue.</p>
    <p>But he no­tably dis­tanced him­self from an Abe-era scan­dal: the con­tro­ver­sial cherry blos­soms gar­den party, in which Mr Abe was al­leged to have wined and dined his vot­ers.</p>
    <p>He said yes­ter­day that he will scrap the party, which has seen a bal­loon­ing bud­get in re­cent years, adding: “I was al­ways against re­quest­ing a bud­get for this event.”</p>
    <p>Mr Suga’s as­cent as leader of the world’s third-largest econ­omy drew</p>
    <p>fe­lic­i­ta­tions from lead­ers abroad. The White House said US Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump is “ready to con­tinue pur­su­ing the vi­sion of a free and open Indo-Pa­cific that he and for­mer Prime Min­is­ter Shinzo Abe forged”.</p>
    <p>Chi­nese Pres­i­dent Xi Jin­ping, in a con­grat­u­la­tory mes­sage to Mr Suga, urged “the devel­op­ment of long-term sta­ble, friendly and co­op­er­a­tive Sino-Ja­panese re­la­tions”, ac­cord­ing to a read­out by the of­fi­cial Xin­hua news agency.</p>
    <p>“This is in the fun­da­men­tal in­ter­ests of the two peo­ples and is also con­ducive to peace and sta­bil­ity in Asia and the pros­per­ity of the world,” he was cited as say­ing.</p>
    <p>South Korean Pres­i­dent Moon Jae-in told Mr Suga in a let­ter that he was will­ing to sit down any time for di­a­logue to im­prove their strained bi­lat­eral ties. He added that Ja­pan was South Korea’s “clos­est friend ge­o­graph­i­cally and cul­tur­ally, as well as shar­ing ba­sic val­ues and strate­gic in­ter­ests”.</p>
    <p>Other lead­ers, in­clud­ing Rus­sian Pres­i­dent Vladimir Putin, Bri­tish</p>
    <p>Prime Min­is­ter Boris John­son, In­dian Prime Min­is­ter Naren­dra Modi and Sin­ga­pore Prime Min­is­ter Lee Hsien Loong also sent con­grat­u­la­tory mes­sages to Mr Suga.</p>
    <p>Mr Abe, who is Ja­pan’s longest­serv­ing leader at 3,188 days, in­clud­ing his first stint from 2006 to 2007, called time on his ten­ure yes­ter­day and was given a poignant send-off by about 200 peo­ple at the Prime Min­is­ter’s Of­fice.</p>
    <p>“For nearly eight years, I have de­voted my body and soul for the eco­nomic re­cov­ery and diplo­macy to pro­tect Ja­pan’s na­tional in­ter­ests ev­ery sin­gle day,” he said, with Mr Suga in the crowd. “I will con­tinue to sup­port the new ad­min­is­tra­tion as a Diet mem­ber.”</p>
    <p>Mr Suga, born in ru­ral Akita pre­fec­ture to straw­berry farm­ers, was for­mally elected as Prime Min­is­ter by both cham­bers of the Diet yes­ter­day. Given the rul­ing Lib­eral Demo­cratic Party’s ma­jor­ity in the Diet, his ap­point­ment as Ja­pan’s new leader was never in doubt since his land­slide vic­tory as the party’s new</p>
    <p>leader on Mon­day. He was elected as PM with 314 out of 462 votes cast by Lower House par­lia­men­tar­i­ans and 142 out of 240 votes cast by Up­per House law­mak­ers.</p>
    <p>In con­trast, op­po­si­tion leader Yukio Edano, 56, of the Con­sti­tu­tional Demo­cratic Party of Ja­pan, won only 134 votes in the Lower House and 78 in the Up­per House.</p>
    <p>Still, a Lower House elec­tion must be called by Oc­to­ber next year and Mr Suga, an eight-term law­maker rep­re­sent­ing a con­stituency in Kana­gawa pre­fec­ture that in­cludes Yoko­hama, dithered when asked if a snap poll is in the off­ing.</p>
    <p>He stressed that his pri­or­ity was for Covid-19 mea­sures – there were 550 cases in Ja­pan yes­ter­day – as well as eco­nomic re­cov­ery.</p>
    <p>He noted that he will not have much time to call a snap elec­tion as the Lower House elec­tion must be held by Oc­to­ber next year. “There is a time limit and I will think about what to do based on that,” he said.</p>
