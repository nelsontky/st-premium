    <p>Or­chard Road malls are keep­ing it sim­ple for the peak shop­ping sea­son, scal­ing down Christ­mas dec­o­ra­tions amid the Covid-19 pandemic.</p>
    <p>For in­stance, Wisma Atria has spent 19 per cent less on Christ­mas dec­o­ra­tions this year than a year ago, while Tan­glin Mall said it has spent “slightly less”. Man­darin Gallery said its bud­get has been “mod­er­ated down­wards”.</p>
    <p>De­sign and build firm Dezign For­mat, which dressed up five Or­chard Road malls this year, said dec­o­ra­tion bud­gets have been “af­fected across the board”.</p>
    <p>Malls such as Far East Plaza are reusing some dec­o­ra­tions from last year, spruc­ing them up where nec­es­sary.</p>
    <p>The Or­chard Road Business As­so­ci­a­tion, which or­gan­ises the an­nual light-up on the street, had ear­lier said that while the light-up re­mains as bright this year as in pre­vi­ous years, safe-dis­tanc­ing mea­sures mean there will be no streetleve­l ac­tiv­i­ties like pop-up stores and per­for­mances.</p>
    <p>The re­tail sec­tor has taken a beating this year. Lat­est gov­ern­ment fig­ures show that for eight months since Fe­bru­ary, monthly re­tail sales, ex­clud­ing mo­tor ve­hi­cles, have been down from a year ago. In Septem­ber, the drop was 12.7 per cent com­pared with the same pe­riod last year.</p>
    <p>Mr Amos Tan, a se­nior lec­turer at Sin­ga­pore Polytech­nic’s School of Business, said that malls may be erring on the side of cau­tion after re­tail stal­wart Robin­sons an­nounced last month that it would close its last two stores, at Raf­fles City Shop­ping Cen­tre and The Heeren.</p>
    <p>He said: “Robin­sons is a wake-up call. We think that Or­chard Road is pandemic-proof, but it’s not. While Christ­mas lights may bring peo­ple to Or­chard Road, whether they will spend is an­other is­sue.”</p>
    <p>Many shop­pers have spot­ted a dif­fer­ence in the light-up all over town – fewer Christ­mas trees, and smaller than those seen in pre­vi­ous years.</p>
    <p>Ms Dolin Ong, 38, said the tree out­side Paragon was the tallest she has seen this year.</p>
    <p>“There are fewer tourists this year so maybe that’s why malls are spend­ing less,” said Ms Ong, who is head of sales in a pay­ments firm.</p>
    <p>Cus­tomer ser­vice ad­viser Vi­vian Ma, 30, said some Or­chard Road malls – known for their photo-op­por­tu­nity dec­o­ra­tions – look lack­lus­tre this year.</p>
    <p>“There was a huge sto­ry­book out­side one of the malls in the past. Ev­ery kid and even adults would run up to take photos with it.”</p>
    <p>The mall dec­o­ra­tions this year are plain, Ms Ma said, but added that she liked the white and gold baubles seen sparkling in the trees lin­ing Or­chard Road.</p>
    <p>“It’s not as ex­cit­ing... but there’s beauty in be­ing sub­tle.”</p>
    <p>An­other shop­per, Mr Mu­nir Mohd Basni, 48, said the blue hues of the Or­chard Road light-up were “calm­ing”, com­pared with the “very bright and golden” ones of Christ­mases past.</p>
    <p>But the su­per­vi­sor in a petro­chem­i­cal firm was struck by the empty spa­ces in front of many malls.</p>
    <p>“There were car­riages out­side some malls in pre­vi­ous years,” said Mr Mu­nir.</p>
    <p>Al­though Christ­mas down­town is less glitzy this year, malls have come up with in­no­va­tive ways to ring in the Yule­tide sea­son.</p>
    <p>Out­side Wisma Atria, a minia­ture red train runs cir­cles around a Christ­mas vil­lage crafted from re­cy­cled ma­te­ri­als at the foot of a tree decked out with pink baubles and gold pine cones.</p>
    <p>Last year’s Christ­mas vil­lage was also con­structed from re­cy­cled pa­per and ply­wood, and these ef­forts are in line with the mall’s sus­tain­abil­ity ef­forts.</p>
    <p>Ion Or­chard, which boasts a 20m-high Christ­mas tree, said each of the 250 pin­wheels em­bel­lish­ing the tree were crafted us­ing non-toxic ma­te­ri­als that are fully re­cy­clable.</p>
    <p>In­stead of us­ing fir or pine trees of­ten as­so­ci­ated with Christ­mas, Or­chard Gate­way opted for a sculp­ture made with crates stacked in the shape of a tree. Fairy lights add a fin­ish­ing touch to the crates, which are painted red and green.</p>
    <p>Mr Suresh Pil­lai, who was in Or­chard Road with his wife Jy­oti on Friday, said it was a bril­liant idea.</p>
    <p>“It’s more like art­work... very dif­fer­ent from your usual Christ­mas tree,” added the 54-year-old su­per­in­ten­dent in the oil and gas sec­tor.</p>

        <p data-role="text">The dec&#xAD;o&#xAD;ra&#xAD;tions may have been scaled down, but malls show the Christ&#xAD;mas spirit is still alive in Or&#xAD;chard Road with touches such as the huge Christ&#xAD;mas tree out&#xAD;side Paragon (left), the lights out&#xAD;side Or&#xAD;chard Cen&#xAD;tral (be&#xAD;low, left) and the rein&#xAD;deer sculp&#xAD;tures at Wisma Atria (be&#xAD;low, right).</p>
