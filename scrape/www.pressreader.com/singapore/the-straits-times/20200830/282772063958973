    <p>The “Red Scare” seems to be spread­ing fast in the United States af­ter US Pres­i­dent Donald Trump said on Aug 11 that if he is not re-elected in Novem­ber, “you’re go­ing to have to learn to speak Chi­nese”.</p>
    <p>But wouldn’t that be a good thing? The more peo­ple across the world speak each other’s mother lan­guage, the bet­ter an un­der­stand­ing they will de­velop.</p>
    <p>I am proud that about 300 mil­lion Chi­nese, al­most the size of the en­tire US pop­u­la­tion, are learn­ing English. Many oth­ers are learn­ing French, Ger­man, Span­ish, Por­tuguese, Ja­panese, Rus­sian and Ara­bic.</p>
    <p>One of my former col­leagues was the envy of our group, partly be­cause he spoke Swahili and was later posted to Nairobi, Kenya.</p>
    <p>I still re­mem­ber a chilly early morn­ing in March 2013, two months af­ter I shifted from New York City to Wash­ing­ton, DC, when I went to the Rock Creek Park to cover a 5km race to raise funds for Wash­ing­ton Latin Pub­lic Char­ter School stu­dents who were plan­ning a 10-day trip to China dur­ing the spring break.</p>
    <p>The stu­dents, many of whom had studied Chi­nese for years, yearned to visit China, to meet Chi­nese peo­ple, and learn more about Chi­nese cul­ture and his­tory.</p>
    <p>While writ­ing this col­umn, I checked on­line and found that their im­pres­sive Chi­nese lan­guage teacher Christina Stouder is still work­ing there.</p>
    <p>Hav­ing spent years in China, in­clud­ing teach­ing in vil­lages in Hu­nan prov­ince, she not only speaks flu­ent Man­darin but is also well versed in Chi­nese cul­ture, his­tory and so­ci­ety.</p>
    <p>Ms Caitlin Keli­her was a se­nior at Ge­orge Wash­ing­ton Univer­sity in Novem­ber 2013 when I met her at “Chi­nese tea time”, a reg­u­lar Chi­nese lan­guage event at the univer­sity’s Sigur Cen­tre for Asian Stud­ies.</p>
    <p>I loved the gath­er­ings be­cause their pro­fes­sor Ed­ward McCord is a bril­liant Chi­nese his­tory pro­fes­sor spe­cial­is­ing in the study of Chi­nese war­lords, some­thing I found fas­ci­nat­ing. When I checked out Ms Keli­her on­line, I found she is work­ing at the Har­vard China Fund as a pro­gramme co­or­di­na­tor af­ter fin­ish­ing her grad­u­ate study at Har­vard Kennedy School.</p>
    <p>In fact, the US Pres­i­dent’s grand­daugh­ter Ara­bella is a star among many Chi­nese peo­ple be­cause of her Chi­nese lan­guage skills. She can sing Man­darin songs, and re­cited the Three Char­ac­ter Clas­sic in front of Chi­nese Pres­i­dent Xi Jin­ping and First Lady Peng Liyuan dur­ing their visit to Mar-a-Lago in Florida in April 2017.</p>
    <p>The US Pres­i­dent was clearly proud when he pre­sented the video clip as a gift to Mr Xi dur­ing his visit to Bei­jing that Novem­ber.</p>
    <p>Over the years, I have in­ter­viewed pas­sion­ate stu­dents of the Chi­nese lan­guage not just in the US, but also in Spain, France, Por­tu­gal, Cuba and Bel­gium, where I am now based. I feel de­lighted</p>
    <p>If you don’t study Chi­nese and don’t know about China, how can you make in­formed de­ci­sions about the coun­try? Sadly, ris­ing McCarthy­ism is bring­ing back the dark days of the late 1940s and 1950s to the US.</p>
    <p>when young peo­ple greet me with ni­hao (Man­darin for “hello”) in a Car­refour su­per­mar­ket or the park near my apart­ment in Brus­sels.</p>
    <p>So, there should be no con­tro­versy, no mat­ter who the US Pres­i­dent is, over peo­ple in the US or any other coun­try learn­ing Chi­nese. Pro­grammes such as “100,000 Strong” to en­cour­age Amer­i­can stu­dents to learn Chi­nese should con­tinue to boost mu­tual un­der­stand­ing. If you don’t study Chi­nese and don’t know about China, how can you make in­formed de­ci­sions about the coun­try?</p>
    <p>Sadly, ris­ing McCarthy­ism is bring­ing back the dark days of the late 1940s and 1950s to the US. No won­der some Ge­orge­town Univer­sity stu­dents pur­su­ing stud­ies in China are wor­ried about not be­ing able to pass se­cu­rity clear­ance when seek­ing a govern­ment job.</p>
    <p>If we tol­er­ate the fear-mon­ger­ing that the US Pres­i­dent and his fel­low politi­cians are in­dulging in, it might not be long be­fore Amer­i­cans speak­ing Man­darin are in­ves­ti­gated by the Fed­eral Bureau of In­ves­ti­ga­tion, or any­one fre­quently din­ing at Chi­nese restau­rants is probed for China con­nec­tions.</p>
