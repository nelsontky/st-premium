    <p>Foot­ball may be Sin­ga­pore’s No. 1 sport but there are other sport­ing love af­fairs around our is­land. In this new fort­nightly se­ries, The Straits Times seeks out new games and dis­cov­ers that a coun­try’s pas­sion for sport, even in this time of Covid, burns brightly.</p>
    <p>On a foggy day in Bo­livia four years ago, Cai Ji­ahui stood 4,700m above sea level, ready to tackle the 64km route in front of her that in­volved sharp turns on three-me­tre wide gravel roads.</p>
    <p>She could barely see five me­tres ahead of her or over the edge and per­haps it was a bless­ing, for the cliff drop was over 600m.</p>
    <p>She was at the start­ing point of the in­fa­mous Death Road, or Yun­gas Road, known for its per­ilous con­di­tions in­clud­ing fog, cas­cades and land­slides.</p>
    <p>Ac­com­pa­ny­ing Cai on this treach­er­ous jour­ney was her trusty travel com­pan­ion — her uni­cy­cle.</p>
    <p>“It was su­per tir­ing, but it was an amaz­ing ex­pe­ri­ence and you’ll never get that with any tourist pack­age,” said Cai, 36, who took 10 hours to com­plete the ride.</p>
    <p>While it was her first time in Bo­livia, it was not her first time ex­plor­ing a for­eign land on a uni­cy­cle. She has also rid­den alone or with fel­low uni­cy­clists in coun­tries such as In­done­sia, South Africa, Mon­go­lia, Ma­cau and Canada.</p>
    <p>“I get to meet peo­ple from all over the place and it’s the best ex­pe­ri­ence go­ing on ad­ven­tures with peo­ple who share com­mon in­ter­ests,” said Cai, who works in a tech com­pany.</p>
    <p>“It’s nice be­cause they’ll take you to places only lo­cals fa­mil­iar with the ter­rain would know. Usu­ally, we’d head to some­where less ex­plored and in­ter­act with lo­cals.</p>
    <p>Some­times, we end up teach­ing them how to ride.</p>
    <p>“It’s re­ally con­ve­nient as well be­cause my uni­cy­cle’s por­ta­ble, fits on any pub­lic trans­port and yet is faster than walk­ing. In other coun­tries, buses may be in­fre­quent or at­trac­tions are lo­cated a dis­tance away. That’s when you’d ap­pre­ci­ate a bike or skate­board – or a uni­cy­cle.”</p>
    <p>Cai has also met for­eign uni­cy­clists dur­ing their vis­its to Sin­ga­pore. One of them was Bri­ton Ed Pratt, who com­pleted a round-the­world trip on a uni­cy­cle, when he stopped over in 2017.</p>
    <p>She has also trav­elled over­seas for uni­cy­cling con­ven­tions such as the biennial Uni­cy­cling Con­ven­tion and World Cham­pi­onships (Uni­con). She has at­tended sev­eral edi­tions, the most re­cent in South Korea in 2018.</p>
    <p>Th­ese con­ven­tions have work­shops on uni­cy­cling or cul­tural ex­changes and there is also a com­pet­i­tive ele­ment with com­pe­ti­tions for street uni­cy­cling, uni­cy­cle hockey, and moun­tain uni­cy­cling among oth­ers.</p>
    <p>She had planned to par­tic­i­pate in this year’s edi­tion in France but it was post­poned to next year ow­ing to the coro­n­avirus pan­demic.</p>
    <p>At home, Cai is a part of in­ter­est group Sin­ga­pore Uni­cy­clists, which has about 100 mem­bers and 20 ac­tive rid­ers.</p>
    <p>While she used to at­tend the group’s weekly uni­cy­cle hockey ses­sions – which is played with hockey sticks and a ten­nis ball in teams of four to five – and leisure rides reg­u­larly, she rides alone more of­ten now and for longer dis­tances.</p>
    <p>The hockey ses­sions have been put on hold ow­ing to the pan­demic and rides are now con­ducted on an ad-hoc ba­sis with up to five peo­ple.</p>
    <p>Two years ago, she did her long­est ride of 80km, which cov­ered Tampines, Changi Vil­lage and City Hall.</p>
    <p>“When I first started out, I was at an age when fall­ing down didn’t hurt so much so I did more street uni­cy­cling with tricks and jumps. As I got older, it be­came more dis­tance rid­ing be­cause it gets me to an­other place rather than just stay­ing in one spot,” said Cai, who picked up the ac­tiv­ity 15 years ago.</p>
    <p>Call­ing it a “great way to so­cialise and keep fit”, she said the uni­cy­cling com­mu­nity is so­cia­ble and friendly.</p>
    <p>One of the many friends she has made is film-maker Seth Tan.</p>
    <p>The 26-year-old, who is also an avid moun­tain biker, was in­tro­duced to uni­cy­cling in 2014 and tried moun­tain uni­cy­cling for the first time in Fe­bru­ary.</p>
    <p>He started with gravel roads and hills on Pu­lau Ubin be­fore at­tempt­ing the moun­tain bike trails at Ch­est­nut Na­ture Park.</p>
    <p>He said: “It’s re­ally the fun of rid­ing some­thing very weird. It’s a very cool feel­ing… I also find it safer than when you’re on a bi­cy­cle be­cause if any­thing hap­pens, all you have to do is dis­mount.”</p>
    <p>Tan was also a reg­u­lar par­tic­i­pant of the weekly hockey games, adding: “It’s re­ally as fun as it gets. There’s a lot of skill in­volved in ma­noeu­vring the ball with a hockey stick while be­ing on a uni­cy­cle and it takes so much ded­i­ca­tion to learn to do that.”</p>
    <p>He is now fo­cused on per­form­ing stunts like rid­ing down stairs and is some­times joined by fel­low uni­cy­clists Eu­gene Sia and Sarah Ang.</p>
    <p>Tan added: “I’m very happy to meet peo­ple in uni­cy­cling. Ev­ery­one is nice and will­ing to share their sto­ries and tips.”</p>
    <p>Ang, 18, hopes to en­cour­age more peo­ple to try the sport and re­cruit more mem­bers for their hockey games.</p>
    <p>She said: “As long as peo­ple are in­ter­ested, we want to let more peo­ple know about this sport and help them learn it as well.”</p>
