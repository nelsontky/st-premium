    <p>• Paris Saint-Ger­main coach Thomas Tuchel waved away ques­tions over his fu­ture af­ter a 2-1 de­feat at RB Leipzig on Wed­nes­day dealt a ma­jor blow to the Cham­pi­ons League as­pi­ra­tions of last sea­son’s run­ners-up.</p>
    <p>Emil Fors­berg’s sec­ond-half penalty gave the Bun­desliga side vic­tory in their Group H clash af­ter former PSG mid­fielder Christophe­r Nkunku can­celled out An­gel di Maria’s opener.</p>
    <p>Di Maria missed a penalty which would have put the French cham­pi­ons 2-0 up de­spite be­ing with­out Ney­mar, Mauro Icardi and Kylian Mbappe due to in­jury, and they ended the game with nine men af­ter late red cards for Idrissa Gu­eye and Pres­nel Kim­pembe.</p>
    <p>Less than three months af­ter lead­ing the Qatar-owned club to the fi­nal for the first time, Tuchel has over­seen a poor start – just one win in three group games – and spec­u­la­tion is grow­ing he might not even last un­til the end of the sea­son when his con­tract ex­pires.</p>
    <p>When asked by French broad­caster RMC Sport if he felt his po­si­tion was un­der threat amid re­ports of clashes with sport­ing di­rec­tor Leonardo, Tuchel replied: “No.”</p>
    <p>PSG have reached the knock­out stage in each of the last eight sea­sons, but their prospects of ad­vanc­ing from the group have not been helped by in­juries and they have now lost two group games for the first time since the 2011 takeover.</p>
    <p>On top of Ney­mar, Mbappe and Icardi, Tuchel also missed the likes of the in­jured Marco Ver­ratti and Juan Ber­nat, and he also could not call on Ju­lian Draxler in Ger­many.</p>
    <p>How­ever, PSG cap­tain Mar­quin­hos is still back­ing the Ger­man to turn things around, say­ing: “Of course (we sup­port him).</p>
    <p>“We know how foot­ball is. It is the coach who has had the best sea­son in club his­tory. Foot­ball has no pa­tience.</p>
    <p>“We need to fo­cus on the real things. Today he is our coach at PSG, we have con­fi­dence in him. If things aren’t go­ing well it’s not just the coach’s fault, the play­ers can do things bet­ter too.</p>
    <p>“When you’re on the pitch, you have to fight to win.”</p>
    <p>While Tuchel is on shaky ground, French daily Le Parisien has re­ported the club are still pre­pared to stick with him un­less his po­si­tion be­comes un­ten­able be­cause he will be owed “at least” €10 mil­lion (S$16 mil­lion) if axed be­fore his deal is up next sum­mer.</p>
    <p>That com­pen­sa­tion fig­ure, how­ever, has not stopped the ru­mour mill, with former Ju­ven­tus coach Mas­si­m­il­iano Al­le­gri and former Tot­ten­ham man­ager Mauri­cio Po­chet­tino both men­tioned as pos­si­ble suc­ces­sors by French foot­ball web­site Le10S­port.</p>
    <p>Hav­ing spent three sea­sons as a PSG player, Po­chet­tino also has a deep con­nec­tion with the club and he has told RMC Sport in the past that “it would be a plea­sure to man­age a big club like Paris, a dream”.</p>
