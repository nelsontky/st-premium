    <p>Aries (March 21 - April 19)</p>
    <p>This is not the time to stand by and watch as events un­fold. Step for­ward and act. Show the world what you are all about.</p>
    <p>Taurus (April 20 - May 20)</p>
    <p>You would rather take things slowly, but some­one is breath­ing down your neck. Stay calm. If you lose your tem­per, you are un­likely to progress.</p>
    <p>Gemini (May 21 - June 20)</p>
    <p>Seize the ini­tia­tive in your group. That could mean speak­ing out of turn or dom­i­nat­ing a con­ver­sa­tion, but it should be a win for you.</p>
    <p>Can­cer (June 21 - July 22) Some­thing jogs your memory late in the day. It could lead to a cas­cade of happy mem­o­ries or a bold new plan, so be ready for ac­tion.</p>
    <p>Leo (July 23 - Aug 22)</p>
    <p>You can have fun do­ing al­most any­thing, so see what hap­pens. You may feel bet­ter tack­ling big-pic­ture is­sues, rather than lit­tle de­tails.</p>
    <p>Virgo (Aug 23 - Sept 22)</p>
    <p>Avoid shar­ing ev­ery­thing with ev­ery­one. Choose what you can live with­out, then pick the peo­ple you think de­serve your se­crets most.</p>
    <p>Libra (Sept 23 - Oct 22)</p>
    <p>Your en­ergy is out­wardly fo­cused, so pay more at­ten­tion to the peo­ple in your life. Many of them need some­thing from you.</p>
    <p>Scorpio (Oct 23 - Nov 21)</p>
    <p>Take life one step at a time and do not miss any­thing im­por­tant. You might have to calm down a per­son who is riled up over noth­ing.</p>
    <p>Sagittariu­s (Nov 22 - Dec 21)</p>
    <p>Your soft side is show­ing, so pay at­ten­tion to your part­ner or crush. Your great en­ergy makes you even more at­trac­tive than usual.</p>
    <p>Capricorn (Dec 22 - Jan 19)</p>
    <p>Your par­ents or grand­par­ents re­quire at­ten­tion, if not ac­tive as­sis­tance. Ei­ther way, it is a good time to re­con­nect with your roots.</p>
    <p>Aquarius (Jan 20 - Feb 18)</p>
    <p>Your job is to push the en­ve­lope and you never seem to get sick of it. Keep on toss­ing out your bril­liant ideas un­til one of them sticks.</p>
    <p>Pisces (Feb 19 - March 20)</p>
    <p>You feel trapped. Try not to panic. You are nearly at the end of the maze. When you get there, you may not be pre­pared for free­dom.</p>
