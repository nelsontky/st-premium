    <p>All mi­grant worker dor­mi­to­ries are ex­pected to be cleared of Covid-19 by Aug 7 ex­cept for 17 stand­alone blocks in pur­pose-built fa­cil­i­ties, said Na­tional De­vel­op­ment Min­is­ter Lawrence Wong.</p>
    <p>These blocks will serve as tem­po­rary quar­an­tine fa­cil­i­ties for work­ers still serv­ing out their iso­la­tion pe­riod.</p>
    <p>Mr Wong, who co-chairs the multi-min­istry task force com­bat­ing the Covid-19 out­break, said yes­ter­day: “It has been a chal­leng­ing and tough jour­ney for ev­ery­one in­volved in clear­ing the mi­grant work­ers in the dor­mi­to­ries... We are fi­nally reach­ing the last stretch.”</p>
    <p>This means that al­most all mi­grant work­ers will be cleared of the virus by early next month, aside from 28,000 who are still in the var­i­ous quar­an­tine fa­cil­i­ties.</p>
    <p>Work­ers who com­plete their iso­la­tion pe­riod will have to take an ad­di­tional Covid-19 test. Those who test neg­a­tive can re­sume work if their em­ploy­ers meet safety re­quire­ments.</p>
    <p>“We will be work­ing very closely with all the com­pa­nies who are en­gag­ing these work­ers to al­low them to start work and to al­low work to re­sume as soon as pos­si­ble,” noted Mr Wong, who also thanked those on the front line in­volved in the clear­ing op­er­a­tion. “Con­trac­tors must also take all the mea­sures se­ri­ously... just be­cause the work­ers are cleared doesn’t mean that they can re­sume ac­tiv­i­ties as be­fore.”</p>
    <p>The Gov­ern­ment is also work­ing with con­trac­tors on hous­ing ar­range­ments for work­ers, such as mov­ing them to al­ter­na­tive ac­com­mo­da­tion fa­cil­i­ties like quick­build dor­mi­to­ries.</p>
    <p>Mr Wong noted that eas­ily more than 80 per cent of the 323,000 work­ers stay­ing in dor­mi­to­ries have ei­ther re­cov­ered or tested neg­a­tive for the coro­n­avirus so far.</p>
    <p>Health Min­is­ter Gan Kim Yong, who also co-chairs the task force, said the au­thor­i­ties will con­tinue to keep a close eye on the con­struc­tion in­dus­try in par­tic­u­lar.</p>
    <p>“We do expect to see from time to time Covid-19 cases among the con­struc­tion in­dus­try... so we need to watch care­fully to make sure that there are no big clus­ters,” he said.</p>
    <p>Mr Wong re­it­er­ated that mi­grant work­ers will con­tinue to be tested reg­u­larly: “If we de­tect... any pos­i­tive case, we will have to go in quickly, again do our usual oper­a­tions, ringfence the area, stop work even, and then do a sweep, ag­gres­sive test­ing around all the close con­tacts.”</p>
    <p>He said con­trac­tors should en­sure safe man­age­ment mea­sures are in place to re­duce the risk once work re­sumes, given that an in­fec­tion could lead to all work stop­ping again.</p>
    <p>The Health Min­istry (MOH) said it ex­pects the daily num­ber of Covid-19 cases to re­main high for the com­ing two weeks be­fore ta­per­ing down. Sin­ga­pore is re­port­ing about 200 to 300 new cases daily.</p>
    <p>MOH med­i­cal ser­vices di­rec­tor Ken­neth Mak said: “The num­bers might in fact also in­crease com­pared to what it was over the last few days.</p>
    <p>“And this is just be­cause we are now test­ing a lot more ag­gres­sively in the re­main­ing dor­mi­to­ries, with a view to­wards clear­ing the re­main­ing work­ers who are there.”</p>
    <p>Mr Wong said the num­ber of daily cases will go down around mid-Au­gust af­ter the clear­ing of dorms. But he warned that the fight was far from over: “I must again re­mind ev­ery­one, just be­cause the case count comes down, that shouldn’t be a rea­son for us to go out to cel­e­brate and have a big party.”</p>
