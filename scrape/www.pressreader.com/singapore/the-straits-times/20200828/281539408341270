    <p>1 Hur­ri­cane Laura made land­fall early yes­ter­day in Louisiana as one of the most pow­er­ful storms to hit the US state, with fore­cast­ers warn­ing it could push a mas­sive wall of wa­ter 65km in­land from the sea. Be­sides threat­en­ing lives, the storm was head­ing for the heart of the US oil in­dus­try, forc­ing oil rigs and re­finer­ies to shut down pro­duc­tion. WORLD</p>
    <p>HOUS­TON (Texas) • Hur­ri­cane Laura made land­fall early yes­ter­day in south-western Louisiana as one of the most pow­er­ful storms to hit the state, with fore­cast­ers warn­ing it could push a mas­sive wall of wa­ter 65km in­land from the sea.</p>
    <p>Laura made land­fall just be­fore 1am (2pm Sin­ga­pore time) as a Cat­e­gory 4 storm pack­ing winds of 240kmh i n the small town of Cameron, Louisiana, the Na­tional Hur­ri­cane Cen­tre (NHC) said.</p>
    <p>It rapidly weak­ened to a Cat­e­gory 2 storm yes­ter­day morn­ing with max­i­mum sus­tained winds of 168kmh as it moved north and bat­tered south-west Louisiana, a marshy re­gion par­tic­u­larly prone to storm surges and flood­ing.</p>
    <p>Be­sides threat­en­ing lives, the storm was head­ing to­wards the heart of the United States oil in­dus­try, forc­ing oil rigs and re­finer­ies to shut down pro­duc­tion.</p>
    <p>Laura’s winds tore through Lake Charles in Louisiana all night, rip­ping roofs from build­ings and shat­ter­ing glass win­dows, showed videos posted on Twit­ter.</p>
    <p>The city of 78,000 was see­ing sus­tained winds of 137kmh and gusts of up to 206kmh in the hour af­ter land­fall, the NHC said.</p>
    <p>“This is one of the strong­est storms to im­pact that sec­tion of coast­line,” said Mr David Roth, a fore­caster with the Na­tional Weather Ser­vice. “We worry about that storm surge go­ing so far in­land there be­cause it’s ba­si­cally all marsh­land north to In­ter­state 10. There is lit­tle to stop the wa­ter.”</p>
    <p>Of­fi­cials across the hard-hit area said it would be sev­eral hours be­fore they could get out to be­gin search and res­cue mis­sions. Downed trees block­ing road­ways were ex­pected to be the big­gest immediate chal­lenge for res­cuers.</p>
    <p>“Cat­a­strophic storm surge, ex­treme winds and flash flood­ing con­tin­ues in por­tions of Louisiana,” the NHC said in a bul­letin.</p>
    <p>The oil-re­fin­ing town of Port Arthur was just west of where Laura made land­fall. The city of 54,000 was a ghost town late on Wed­nes­day, with just a cou­ple of gas sta­tions and a liquor store open for busi­ness.</p>
    <p>“Peo­ple need their vodka,” said cashier Janaka Bala­sooriya, who said he lived a few blocks away and would ride out the storm at home.</p>
    <p>Just hours be­fore Laura smashed into the coast, Port Arthur res­i­dent Eric Daw hus­tled to fill up his car at one of the few petrol sta­tions still open.</p>
    <p>He said he had wanted to evac­u­ate ear­lier, but lacked money for petrol as he was wait­ing on a dis­abil­ity pay­ment. Mr Daw was headed to a shel­ter in San An­to­nio, a 41/ 2- hour drive, where in­stead of wor­ry­ing about the storm he has to con­tend with Covid-19, echo­ing the con­cerns of many oth­ers.</p>
    <p>“They say we are all sup­posed to so­cially dis­tance now,” he said. “But how am I sup­posed to so­cially dis­tance in a shel­ter?”</p>
    <p>About 620,000 peo­ple were un­der manda­tory evac­u­a­tion or­ders in Louisiana and Texas.</p>
    <p>The storm surge could pen­e­trate in­land from Sea Rim State Park, Texas, to In­tra­coastal City, Louisiana, and could raise wa­ter lev­els as high as 6m in parts of Cameron Par­ish in Louisiana, the NHC said.</p>
    <p>“To think that there would be a wall of wa­ter over two storeys high com­ing on shore is very dif­fi­cult for most to con­ceive, but that is what is go­ing to hap­pen,” said Na­tional Weather Ser­vice me­te­o­rol­o­gist Ben­jamin Schott, at a news con­fer­ence on Tues­day. Most of Louisiana’s Cameron Par­ish would be un­der wa­ter at some point, he added.</p>
    <p>Laura could also spawn tor­na­does over Louisiana, Arkansas and western Mis­sis­sippi, and was ex­pected to drop 15cm to 30cm of rain over the re­gion, the NHC said.</p>
