    <p>MINSK • Be­larus voted in an elec­tion yes­ter­day pit­ting Pres­i­dent Alexan­der Lukashenko against a former teacher who emerged from ob­scu­rity to lead the big­gest chal­lenge in years against the man who has ruled the coun­try for a quar­ter of a cen­tury.</p>
    <p>The 65-year-old Mr Lukashenko is al­most cer­tain to win a sixth con­sec­u­tive term but could face a new wave of protests amid anger over his han­dling of the coro­n­avirus out­break, the econ­omy and his hu­man rights record.</p>
    <p>A crack­down on the op­po­si­tion could hurt Mr Lukashenko’s at­tempts to mend fences with the West amid fray­ing ties with tra­di­tional ally Rus­sia, which has tried to press Be­larus into closer eco­nomic and po­lit­i­cal union.</p>
    <p>A former Soviet col­lec­tive farm man­ager, Mr Lukashenko has ruled Be­larus since 1994.</p>
    <p>He faces a sur­prise ri­val in Ms Svet­lana Tikhanousk­aya, a former English teacher who en­tered the race af­ter her hus­band, an anti-govern­ment blog­ger who in­tended to run, was jailed.</p>
    <p>Her ral­lies have drawn some of the big­gest crowds since the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991, and yes­ter­day she ar­rived at a polling sta­tion with hun­dreds of sup­port­ers chant­ing her name.</p>
    <p>She ex­pressed hope for a free elec­tion. “I re­ally want the elec­tion to be hon­est, be­cause if the au­thor­i­ties have noth­ing to fear, if all the peo­ple are for Alexan­der Grig­o­rye­vich (Lukashenko), then we will agree with that,” Ms Tikhanousk­aya said as she cast her bal­lot in the cap­i­tal Minsk.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to hu­man rights groups, more than 1,300 peo­ple have been de­tained in the crack­down, in­clud­ing in­de­pen­dent elec­tion ob­servers and mem­bers of Ms Tikhanousk­aya’s cam­paign team.</p>
    <p>Af­ter cast­ing his vote, Mr Lukashenko de­nied im­pos­ing any re­pres­sive mea­sures, dis­miss­ing the claims as “fake news or far­fetched ac­cu­sa­tions” and said he did not re­gard Ms Tikhanousk­aya’s camp as a threat.</p>
    <p>“They are not worth enough to carry out any re­pres­sion against them,” he said.</p>
    <p>For­eign ob­servers have not judged an elec­tion to be free and fair in Be­larus for a quar­ter of a cen­tury and Mr Lukashenko has warned pro­test­ers against tak­ing to the streets af­ter the vote.</p>
    <p>In pos­si­ble an­tic­i­pa­tion of un­rest, lo­cal me­dia re­ported squares be­ing blocked off by the au­thor­i­ties in Minsk and the pres­ence of some sol­diers on the cap­i­tal’s out­skirts.</p>
    <p>So­cial me­dia net­works ex­pe­ri­enced dis­rup­tion.</p>
    <p>Queues also formed out­side the Be­laru­sian em­bassies in Moscow and Kiev for vot­ers cast­ing their bal­lot abroad.</p>
    <p>“It is un­bear­able to have him in power for so many years. The man should un­der­stand him­self that he must just leave,” said Mr Yuri Kan­ifa­tov i n Moscow, who voted against Mr Lukashenko.</p>
    <p>Por­tray­ing him­self as a guar­an­tor of sta­bil­ity but crit­i­cised by the West as dic­ta­to­rial, Mr Lukashenko says the op­po­si­tion pro­test­ers are in ca­hoots with for­eign back­ers to desta­bilise the coun­try.</p>
    <p>“Lukashenko a pri­ori made it clear that he in­tends to re­tain his power at any cost. The ques­tion re­mains what the price will be,” said po­lit­i­cal an­a­lyst Alexan­der Klaskovsky.</p>
    <p>Wed­ded to a Soviet-style eco­nomic model, Mr Lukashenko has strug­gled to raise in­comes and liv­ing stan­dards in re­cent years.</p>
    <p>He also faced anger over his han­dling of the coro­n­avirus out­break, which he had ear­lier dis­missed as a “psy­chosis” while sug­gest­ing drink­ing vodka and play­ing ice hockey as reme­dies.</p>
    <p>Ms Tikhanousk­aya, ig­nor­ing jibes about a woman’s fit­ness to run for of­fice, launched her cam­paign with the sup­port of the wives of two other can­di­dates, Mr Vik­tor Babariko, who was jailed, and Mr Valery Tsep­kalo, who had fled abroad fear­ing ar­rest.</p>
    <p>Ms Tikhanousk­aya’s cam­paign of­fice said Mr Tsep­kalo’s wife has also left the coun­try for Rus­sia out of con­cern for her safety.</p>
    <p>“We have been in con­tact with Veronika Tsep­kalo. She says she is in Moscow and will vote there,” the press ser­vice for the cam­paign said.</p>
