    <p>KUALA LUMPUR • Malaysia’s For­eign Min­is­ter Hisham­mud­din Hus­sein said he has paid a fine af­ter he was caught on cam­era va­p­ing in Par­lia­ment.</p>
    <p>“I was com­pounded for it and paid the fine. As I had stated, a wrong is a wrong and I had ad­mit­ted to it and apol­o­gised,” he said, when the is­sue was raised by opposition MP Wong Shu Qi in the House yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>From Jan­uary, those smok­ing in pro­hib­ited ar­eas will be is­sued a com­pound fine of RM250</p>
    <p>(S$81.80).</p>
    <p>Those who fail to pay the fine may be charged in court, where they are li­able for a max­i­mum fine of RM10,000 or two years in jail.</p>
    <p>Datuk Seri Hisham­mud­din was re­spond­ing to Ms Wong’s in­ter­jec­tion in the House. Ms Wong said she raised the mat­ter last week un­der Stand­ing Or­der 41(d) that an MP is not al­lowed to smoke in the House when a sit­ting is in ses­sion.</p>
    <p>Deputy Speaker Mohd Rashid</p>
    <p>Has­non took note that Mr Hisham­mud­din had apol­o­gised for his ac­tion.</p>
    <p>Ear­lier, be­fore the start of the par­lia­men­tary ses­sion, a re­minder was an­nounced over Par­lia­ment’s pub­lic ad­dress sys­tem that smok­ing was pro­hib­ited, in­clud­ing in­side the hall.</p>
    <p>Last Thurs­day, a nine-sec­ond video clip showed Mr Hisham­mud­din sneak­ing a puff while wear­ing a face mask in the House.</p>
