    <p>LON­DON Britain could see more than twice as many job losses in the com­ing months than in the last re­ces­sion after the 2008 global fi­nan­cial crisis, un­der­scor­ing the bleak out­look for the labour mar­ket.</p>
    <p>Around 450,000 roles look set to be ter­mi­nated in the au­tumn, ac­cord­ing to anal­y­sis by the In­sti­tute for Employment Stud­ies (IES). That was based on no­ti­fi­ca­tions to the gov­ern­ment’s In­sol­vency Ser­vice, which em­ploy­ers are legally re­quired to file if they plan to cut at least 20 po­si­tions.</p>
    <p>The fig­ures are a stark re­minder of the dif­fi­cul­ties fac­ing busi­nesses after months of re­stric­tions to slow the spread of Covid-19. The end of state wage sup­port mea­sures looks likely to un­leash a wave of job cuts, ex­ac­er­bat­ing the sharpest eco­nomic contractio­n in cen­turies.</p>
    <p>Bri­tish fi­nance min­is­ter Rishi</p>
    <p>Su­nak is fac­ing grow­ing calls from in­dus­try groups and law­mak­ers to ex­tend the fur­lough pro­gramme, un­der which the gov­ern­ment has paid as much as 80 per cent of the wages of some 9.6 mil­lion work­ers. It is due to be wound down al­to­gether at the end of next month.</p>
    <p>Yet he faces spi­ralling costs from crisis mea­sures that have seen gov­ern­ment debt bal­loon to over £2 tril­lion (S$3.5 tril­lion) for the first time. The Bank of Eng­land’s chief economist Andy Hal­dane said pro­long­ing the pro­gramme could de­lay a much-needed re­struc­tur­ing.</p>
    <p>“The sad re­al­ity is that this re­struc­tur­ing can­not be averted en­tirely, but we can do a lot more to min­imise the job losses,” said IES di­rec­tor Tony Wil­son.</p>
    <p>“We need tightly tar­geted sup­port” to help firms, he added.</p>
