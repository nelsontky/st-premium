    <p>Check­ing i n with the TraceTo­gether app or to­ken will soon be com­pul­sory for all cinema­go­ers, with the new mea­sure to be rolled out pro­gres­sively at cin­ema halls from next Mon­day.</p>
    <p>There will be a grace pe­riod un­til Nov 16 for cin­ema op­er­a­tors to fully im­ple­ment TraceTo­gether, after which it will be the only op­tion for pa­trons for en­try.</p>
    <p>This means that cinema­go­ers will no longer be able to gain en­try by scan­ning SafeEn­try QR codes with their phone cam­eras or the SingPass mo­bile app, or the bar codes on their NRICs.</p>
    <p>In­de­pen­dent cin­ema The Pro­jec­tor was the first op­er­a­tor to break the news to pa­trons in a Face­book post yes­ter­day, not­ing that no one will be al­lowed en­try to the cin­ema un­less they use ei­ther the TraceTo­gether app or to­ken.</p>
    <p>The Pro­jec­tor gen­eral man­ager Prashant So­mo­sun­dram told The Straits Times that cin­ema op­er­a­tors had been briefed on what to ex­pect.</p>
    <p>“Of­fi­cially, we were told that there is a grace pe­riod un­til Nov 16 to strad­dle both sys­tems, but we are mak­ing (com­pul­sory TraceTo­gether) ef­fec­tive from... Oct 26 be­cause we are tight on man­power,” he said.</p>
    <p>The TraceTo­gether app in­cludes a func­tion for scan­ning SafeEn­try QR codes, while the to­kens sport a QR code with a sim­i­lar func­tion.</p>
    <p>SafeEn­try is the na­tional dig­i­tal check-in sys­tem that logs the iden­ti­fi­ca­tion num­bers and mo­bile num­bers of in­di­vid­u­als vis­it­ing venues.</p>
    <p>A Smart Na­tion and Dig­i­tal Gov­ern­ment Group (SNDGG) spokes-man said yes­ter­day that the de­ci­sion was made to have a grace pe­riod in or­der to al­low pa­trons more time to ad­just to the new re­quire­ment.</p>
    <p>“Op­er­a­tors need not ac­quire new equip­ment, and only need to in­stall the SafeEn­try scan­ning app on any smart­phone in or­der to scan the QR code on the (TraceTo­gether) to­ken,” the spokesman added.</p>
    <p>Cin­e­mas could be the first of many venues to in­tro­duce com­pul­sory TraceTo­gether-only en­try in the com­ing weeks.</p>
    <p>The au­thor­i­ties said last month that they were in­tro­duc­ing TraceTo­gether-only en­try on a pi­lot ba­sis at a few se­lected venues, but would ramp up im­ple­men­ta­tion “after the na­tional dis­tri­bu­tion of the TraceTo­gether to­kens is well un­der way”.</p>
    <p>The dis­tri­bu­tion kicked off last month at 20 com­mu­nity cen­tres, and was ex­panded to a fur­ther 100 lo­ca­tions, in­clud­ing malls, this month. More than 100,000 to­kens have been col­lected as at Oct 4, fig­ures re­leased by the SNDGG showed.</p>
    <p>Cin­e­mas, ho­tels, food and bev­er­age out­lets, gyms and cer­tain of­fices were among the venues listed by SNDGG last month where TraceTo­gether-only en­try could be im­ple­mented.</p>
    <p>“As such set­tings have the po­ten­tial to spark off large out­breaks from a sin­gle pos­i­tive Covid-19 case that spreads be­yond the ac­tiv­ity or venue, the use of TraceTo­gether can fa­cil­i­tate rapid and com­pre­hen­sive con­tact trac­ing to stem on­ward spread,” an SNDGG spokesman said then.</p>
