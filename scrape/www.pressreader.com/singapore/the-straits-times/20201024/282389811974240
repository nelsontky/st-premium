    <p>LISBON • McLaren are tight­en­ing pro­ce­dures against Covid-19 to pro­tect their For­mula One driv­ers Car­los Sainz and Lando Nor­ris, af­ter what team prin­ci­pal An­dreas Seidl called a “wake-up call” in Ger­many two weeks ago.</p>
    <p>Reign­ing cham­pi­ons Mercedes had two pos­i­tive cases at the Oct 11 Nur­bur­gring race, and had to iso­late team mem­bers and fly in re­place­ments from Eng­land.</p>
    <p>Rac­ing Point bil­lion­aire owner Lawrence Stroll and his driver son Lance also tested pos­i­tive that Sun­day, with the Canadian be­com­ing the se­cond F1 driver af­ter team­mate Ser­gio Perez to be in­fected.</p>
    <p>“What hap­pened at the Nur­bur­gring, that’s just an­other wake-up call for the en­tire team to make sure we don’t get com­pla­cent,” Seidl said ahead of to­mor­row’s Por­tuguese Grand Prix.</p>
    <p>“We did some ad­di­tional mea­sures for here again, in terms of separat­ing the peo­ple even more as far as it is pos­si­ble in the of­fices and in the garages.</p>
    <p>“We did an­other step also with the driv­ers to sep­a­rate them even more from the team dur­ing the race week­end, sim­ply to make sure we do what is pos­si­ble.”</p>
    <p>F1 is op­er­at­ing in a “bub­ble”, with teams tested ev­ery five days and kept apart in the pad­dock.</p>
    <p>They are also keep­ing re­place­ment staff on standby and the gov­ern­ing body has tight­ened pro­ce­dures since Nur­bur­gring, with no­body al­lowed into the pad­dock with­out hav­ing pro­duced a neg­a­tive test re­sult on site.</p>
    <p>Mercedes team boss Toto Wolff also re­vealed that Lewis Hamil­ton and team­mate Valt­teri Bot­tas were iso­lat­ing as much as pos­si­ble.</p>
    <p>“The driv­ers are the most re­stricted of the whole group, of the whole team,” said the Aus­trian.</p>
    <p>“It’s cer­tainly not a great sit­u­a­tion for them be­cause you al­most need to live like a her­mit.”</p>
    <p>In yes­ter­day’s first prac­tice ses­sion, the Sil­ver Ar­rows made it a one-two, with Bot­tas (1:18.410) edg­ing Hamil­ton (1:18:749) as the first F1 ses­sion in Por­tu­gal since 1996 got un­der way.</p>
