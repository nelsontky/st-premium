    <p>CHICAGO • More than 15,000 minks in the United States have died of the coro­n­avirus since Au­gust, and the au­thor­i­ties are keep­ing about a dozen farms un­der quar­an­tine while they in­ves­ti­gate the cases, state agri­cul­ture of­fi­cials said.</p>
    <p>Global health of­fi­cials are eye­ing the an­i­mals as a po­ten­tial risk af­ter Den­mark last week em­barked on a plan to cull all of its 17 mil­lion minks, say­ing a mu­tated coro­n­avirus strain could move to hu­mans and evade fu­ture Covid-19 vac­cines.</p>
    <p>The US states of Utah, Wisconsin and Michi­gan said they do not plan to cull an­i­mals and are mon­i­tor­ing the sit­u­a­tion in Den­mark.</p>
    <p>“We be­lieve quar­an­tin­ing af­fected mink farms in ad­di­tion to im­ple­ment­ing strin­gent biose­cu­rity mea­sures will suc­ceed in con­trol­ling Sars-CoV-2 at th­ese lo­ca­tions,” the US Depart­ment of Agri­cul­ture (USDA) said on Tues­day.</p>
    <p>It added it is work­ing with the US Cen­tres for Dis­ease Con­trol and Preven­tion (CDC), state of­fi­cials and the mink in­dus­try to test and track in­fected farms.</p>
    <p>The US has 359,850 minks bred to pro­duce ba­bies, known as kits, and pro­duced 2.7 mil­lion pelts last year.</p>
    <p>Wisconsin is the largest minkpro­duc­ing state, fol­lowed by Utah. Sick minks in Wisconsin and Utah were ex­posed to peo­ple with prob­a­ble or con­firmed Covid-19 in­fec­tion, the USDA said. In Michi­gan, it is still un­known if the minks were in­fected by hu­mans, it added.</p>
    <p>In Utah, the first US state to con­firm mink in­fec­tions in Au­gust, about 10,700 minks have died on nine farms, said state vet­eri­nar­ian</p>
    <p>Dean Tay­lor. “On all nine, ev­ery­thing is still sug­gest­ing a one-way travel from peo­ple to the minks.”</p>
    <p>Coro­n­avirus test­ing has been done on minks that die and ran­domly on the af­fected farms, said Dr Tay­lor. Some minks are asymp­to­matic or mildly af­fected.</p>
    <p>The CDC said it is sup­port­ing states’ in­ves­ti­ga­tions into sick minks, in­clud­ing test­ings. “Th­ese in­ves­ti­ga­tions will help us learn more about the trans­mis­sion dy­nam­ics be­tween minks, other an­i­mals around the farms and peo­ple. Cur­rently there is no ev­i­dence that an­i­mals play a sig­nif­i­cant role in the spread of Sars-CoV-2 to peo­ple.”</p>
    <p>Coro­n­avirus is thought to have first jumped to hu­mans from an­i­mals in China, pos­si­bly via bats or an­other an­i­mal at a food mar­ket in Wuhan, although many out­stand­ing ques­tions re­main.</p>
    <p>Mon­i­tor­ing US minks for virus symp­toms and quar­an­tin­ing in­fected farms should limit the dis­ease’s spread if cases are caught early, said vi­rol­o­gist Richard Webby.</p>
    <p>The US au­thor­i­ties are urg­ing farm­ers to wear pro­tec­tive gear when han­dling minks to avoid in­fect­ing the an­i­mals.</p>
    <p>One farm in Wisconsin is com­post­ing the dead minks to dis­pose of the car­casses with­out spread­ing the virus, state vet­eri­nar­ian Dar­lene Kon­kle said. The au­thor­i­ties are work­ing with a sec­ond farm to de­cide how to dis­pose of the minks, and dead an­i­mals are be­ing kept in a metal con­tainer in the mean­time.</p>
    <p>State of­fi­cials said they are work­ing with the USDA to de­ter­mine whether farm­ers can sell the pelts of in­fected minks. The pelts are used to make fur coats and other items.</p>
