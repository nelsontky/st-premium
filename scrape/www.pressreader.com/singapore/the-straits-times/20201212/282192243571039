    <p>Entreprene­ur Eu­gene Wang’s dream is to some day see Sin­ga­pore feed­ing as­tro­nauts sus­tain­able, tasty and nu­tri­tious food as they ex­plore space. His as­tro­nom­i­cal am­bi­tions, how­ever, are rooted in a mi­cro­scopic so­lu­tion – mi­croal­gae.</p>
    <p>Th­ese tiny greens are packed with min­er­als and vi­ta­mins, and are 60 per cent pro­tein. In com­par­i­son, soya – the most pro­tein-rich plant – com­prises 30 per cent pro­tein.</p>
    <p>Mi­croal­gae, once an un­der­rated su­per­food, is fer­mented in a biore­ac­tor and within three days, edi­ble pro­tein flour can be ex­tracted and used to make var­i­ous plant-based foods.</p>
    <p>“We can de­sign a small biore­ac­tor and har­vest­ing sys­tem, and fit it into a space­craft. Sin­ga­pore can come up with a won­der­ful space food pro­gramme for space mis­sions,” said Mr Wang an­i­mat­edly.</p>
    <p>But be­fore that hap­pens, the chief ex­ec­u­tive of food-tech startup So­phie’s Bionu­tri­ents wants to feed the Repub­lic.</p>
    <p>The com­pany’s first pro­duc­tion fa­cil­ity in Sci­ence Park 2 will be up and run­ning by the sec­ond half of next year. The 464 sq m fa­cil­ity will have in­dus­try-scale biore­ac­tor tanks along with other equip­ment such as spray dry­ers.</p>
    <p>The com­pany is work­ing with four strains of mi­croal­gae, sourced from over­seas. The new fa­cil­ity – which will har­vest the pro­tein from a 20,000-litre tank – will have the ca­pac­ity to pro­duce 10 tonnes of pro­tein flour a month, said Mr Wang.</p>
    <p>The com­pany’s chief op­er­at­ing of­fi­cer Barn­abas Chan said: “To pro­duce a tonne of soy pro­tein, you need 5ha of land. For us, it’s about 0.02ha of land.”</p>
    <p>On Thurs­day, Pres­i­dent Hal­imah Ya­cob vis­ited the start-up at the Sin­ga­pore In­sti­tute of Food and</p>
    <p>Biotech­nol­ogy In­no­va­tion’s (Sifbi) lab at the Agency for Sci­ence, Tech­nol­ogy and Re­search. Sifbi is the start-up’s re­search and devel­op­ment col­lab­o­ra­tor.</p>
    <p>She said it is im­por­tant to look at all op­tions in al­ter­na­tive food sources, so that Sin­ga­pore can meet its goal of pro­duc­ing 30 per cent of its nu­tri­tional needs within a decade to boost its food re­silience.</p>
    <p>“The va­garies of weather, cli­mate change and hav­ing to re­duce car­bon emis­sions make it dif­fi­cult for us to just look at tra­di­tional meth­ods of grow­ing food.”</p>
    <p>It was an­nounced last week that Sin­ga­pore was the first in the world to ap­prove cell-cul­tured meat for sale as food. It was de­vel­oped by Cal­i­for­nian start-up Eat Just, which will be man­u­fac­tur­ing its cul­tured chicken bites here.</p>
    <p>Other start-ups here have de­vel­oped pro­to­types of cell-cul­tured seafood, pork and milk as well.</p>
    <p>The Pres­i­dent also high­lighted how So­phie’s Bionu­tri­ents uses in­dus­trial food waste such as soya pulp from tofu man­u­fac­tur­ers to feed the mi­croal­gae while it is fer­ment­ing and help it mul­ti­ply.</p>
    <p>The start-up’s white, odour­less pro­tein flour will even­tu­ally be sup­plied to com­pa­nies in the United States to cre­ate plant-based milk. Its brown flour, which smells like sea­weed and has an umami flavour, will be used by two food man­u­fac­tur­ers to cre­ate plant-based “chicken essence” and “crab cakes”.</p>
    <p>The pro­tein flour will be sold to food com­pa­nies at about US$30 (S$40) per kilo­gram next year, said Mr Wang.</p>
    <p>He hopes to sell it at US$2 per kilo­gram within five to 10 years, as pro­duc­tion scales up and mas­sive 300,000-litre tanks are used. This way, his pro­tein can feed de­vel­op­ing coun­tries as well.</p>
