    <p>A fash­ion ex­hibit at the Asian Civil­i­sa­tions Mu­seum (ACM), a re­tail op­por­tu­nity with multi-la­bel store So­ci­etyA, and the chance to show at Paris Fash­ion Week.</p>
    <p>These are the cov­eted prizes one de­signer will walk away with at this year’s de­sign com­pe­ti­tion Sin­ga­pore Sto­ries.</p>
    <p>Five la­bels – Nude Femme, CYC Tai­lor, Carol Chen, Martha Who and Nida Shay – are in the fi­nals, which will end with a run­way show in Oc­to­ber. All the brands are fronted by women de­sign­ers.</p>
    <p>The an­nual de­sign com­pe­ti­tion or­gan­ised by the Tex­tile and Fash­ion Fed­er­a­tion (TaFF) al­most did not hap­pen be­cause of Covid-19. But TaFF’s chief ex­ec­u­tive Se­mun Ho says the call to serve the fash­ion com­mu­nity was too loud.</p>
    <p>“We de­cided to move ahead as the ob­jec­tive be­hind this was to help de­sign­ers get inspired by their own sto­ries of Sin­ga­pore and cel­e­brate lo­cal cre­ativ­ity.”</p>
    <p>The com­pe­ti­tion was started in 2018 to pro­mote, sup­port and de­velop the lo­cal fash­ion in­dus­try. This year’s theme is “Re-Imag­in­ing His­tory and Cre­at­ing the Fu­ture”.</p>
    <p>The de­ci­sion to go ahead with the com­pe­ti­tion was also to help “up­lift an oth­er­wise gloomy hori­zon”, adds Ms Ho, who is one of the judges.</p>
    <p>The newly added prizes are a big draw. Af­ter the fi­nal run­way pre­sen­ta­tion, the win­ner will snag a spot in a mu­seum show­case.</p>
    <p>A piece from the win­ning cap­sule will be dis­played in ACM’s first ex­hi­bi­tion on the con­tem­po­rary fash­ion of Sin­ga­pore in the mid­dle of next year, along­side prom­i­nent Sin­ga­pore and Sin­ga­pore-based de­sign­ers.</p>
    <p>It “is a big deal” and marks the first time a lo­cal fash­ion de­signer would be ex­hib­ited at ACM, says Mr Ken­nie Ting, direc­tor of ACM and Per­anakan Mu­seum.</p>
    <p>Part­ner­ing TaFF for Sin­ga­pore Sto­ries is in line with ACM’s new fo­cus on dec­o­ra­tive arts. It un­veiled per­ma­nent fash­ion, tex­tile and jew­ellery gal­leries in April.</p>
    <p>“This project is part of our broader ef­forts to present con­tem­po­rary fash­ion in Asia, to con­tex­tu­alise Sin­ga­porean fash­ion within Asian fash­ion and to con­trib­ute to a na­tional dis­cus­sion on what Sin­ga­pore fash­ion is,” says Mr Ting, who is also on the judg­ing panel.</p>
    <p>“It is also to make a point to lo­cal au­di­ences that there is such a thing as Sin­ga­pore fash­ion, that it is worth sup­port­ing.”</p>
    <p>As a judge, he is look­ing for non­lit­eral in­ter­pre­ta­tions of Sin­ga­porean-ness, not “de­signs that claim to be Sin­ga­porean sim­ply be­cause they have flo­ral, botan­i­cal, or Per­anakan de­signs”.</p>
    <p>And yes, no or­chid mo­tifs ei­ther. In­stead, he hopes to see con­cepts that present a per­sonal, orig­i­nal take on what Sin­ga­pore is.</p>
    <p>Ms Ho adds that they are look­ing for “de­signs with a nar­ra­tive that is re­lat­able, dis­tinctly Sin­ga­pore-inspired and a cel­e­bra­tion of Asian craft”. Points are also given to sus­tain­abil­ity ef­forts in the de­signs or use of ma­te­ri­als.</p>
    <p>TaFF has been pro­vid­ing men­tor­ship to the con­tes­tants, with in­dus­try ex­perts giv­ing feed­back on de­sign, prod­uct DNA and brand po­si­tion­ing, says Ms Ho.</p>
    <p>“We hope such ef­forts will help the de­sign­ers learn about them­selves, be aware of the en­vi­ron­ment and find hope and in­spi­ra­tion de­spite these dif­fi­cult times.”</p>
