    <p>JO­HOR BARU • A top Bri­tish in­ter­na­tional school lo­cated in Iskan­dar Pu­teri is at risk of clos­ing down af­ter eight years due to the im­pact of the Covid-19 pan­demic, said Jo­hor Men­teri Be­sar Hasni Mo­ham­mad.</p>
    <p>Datuk Hasni said that the school’s stu­dents, num­ber­ing be­tween 800 and 900, could not com­mute daily be­tween their school and Sin­ga­pore as the bor­der has re­mained gen­er­ally shut from mid-March.</p>
    <p>“I re­ceived a let­ter from the school ask­ing for help from the state gov­ern­ment to find a way to al­low their stu­dents to travel daily to at­tend classes.</p>
    <p>“In the let­ter, the school also de­scribed the chal­lenges it is go­ing through, where it is fac­ing the pos­si­bil­ity of hav­ing to shut down as it is un­able to op­er­ate as usual,” Mr Hasni said in his speech dur­ing the Jo­hor me­dia club’s an­nual gen­eral assem­bly held at a ho­tel in the state cap­i­tal on Thurs­day night.</p>
    <p>He said it would be a huge loss for Jo­hor if an in­ter­na­tional-level ed­u­ca­tional in­sti­tu­tion had to cease op­er­a­tions.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to the Men­teri Be­sar, the state would be dis­cussing the mat­ter with Pu­tra­jaya soon. Mr Hasni said he would be meet­ing Prime Min­is­ter Muhyid­din Yassin and urg­ing the fed­eral gov­ern­ment to speed up dis­cus­sions on re­open­ing the bor­der with Sin­ga­pore for daily com­muters.</p>
    <p>In an­other mat­ter, the Jo­hor Men­teri Be­sar said that Malaysia’s For­eign Min­istry would be pre­sent­ing a paper to the Cab­i­net soon on the open­ing of a Jo­hor gov­ern­ment of­fice in Sin­ga­pore that fo­cuses on econ­omy, trade and cul­ture.</p>
    <p>“We be­lieve that with our pres­ence in Sin­ga­pore, we would be able to ex­plore more col­lab­o­ra­tion be­tween us and them. Our in­ter­est with Sin­ga­pore is not lim­ited to only trade mat­ters, but also in other ar­eas such as wa­ter re­sources and wa­ter bound­aries.</p>
    <p>“These are is­sues that re­quire good re­la­tions be­tween Sin­ga­pore and Jo­hor,” he said.</p>
