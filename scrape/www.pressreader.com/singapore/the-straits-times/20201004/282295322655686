    <p>Work 0 and Va­ca­tion 1.</p>
    <p>I am in a room with a view, in a ho­tel that is a na­tional mon­u­ment. Be­hind me is a bal­cony that opens up to a panorama of Ma­rina Bay, al­beit from the sixth floor, on this gen­tly sunny week­day.</p>
    <p>High­lights of Euro­pean foot­ball matches are be­ing shown on the gi­ant flat-screen tele­vi­sion on the wall – a per­fect div­ing header bulges the net.</p>
    <p>It is 11.30am, two hours after I checked into The Fuller­ton Ho­tel. I am seated at a round ta­ble, with my lap­top and a cup of half-fin­ished cof­fee, try­ing in vain to tick off even one task on my to-do list.</p>
    <p>Ac­tu­ally, no­body is keep­ing score. Why don’t I nap? Soak in the bath­tub? (Nah, sen­si­tive skin.)</p>
    <p>With many of us work­ing from home as a re­sult of the Covid-19 pan­demic, the bound­ary be­tween work and rest has dis­solved. A worka­tion threat­ens to mess things up fur­ther. Shelling out for a 12-hour worka­tion pack­age (say 7am to 7pm or 9.30am to 9.30pm) and try­ing to squeeze work and fun into said hours can be stress­ful in it­self.</p>
    <p>But I let go of worry – for a few min­utes – as I pause to take in my bright and airy Ma­rina Bay View Room, which has nice nos­tal­gic touches, with paint­ings of scenes of colo­nial Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>Work feels like an af­ter­thought in this gen­teel room – it is mildly dis­tress­ing when I can’t find power out­lets near the ta­ble to plug in my lap­top at first (out­lets are con­cealed un­der a nearby panel). And the round ta­ble is not very boss-like, though the chair won’t look out of place in an of­fice.</p>
    <p>I pick up the Sam­sung tablet pro­vided to see what to or­der for room ser­vice in­stead. The worka­tion pack­age gives me $50 in food and bev­er­age credit. Half an hour later, the nasi goreng I or­dered is pushed to my room by a man with the vomit-green SG Clean but­ton af­fixed to his chest.</p>
    <p>My ef­forts to ig­nore the call of the bal­cony chair, couch, bed and tub have de­pleted my en­ergy – I wolf down the sa­tay, fried chicken, fried rice and omelette.</p>
    <p>It is 1pm. Time to hit the pool for a power lap or two. Oooh, the Fuller­ton bathrobe feels very soft. There is al­ways a lift wait­ing for me dur­ing these safely dis­tant times.</p>
    <p>A few vis­i­tors are ly­ing on deck chairs and one or two peo­ple are in the 25m out­door in­fin­ity pool that looks out to the sur­round­ing Asian Civil­i­sa­tions Mu­seum, Vic­to­ria Con­cert Hall and Boat Quay.</p>
    <p>But it is too hot to swim.</p>
    <p>I head to the lobby. The brass door is busy re­volv­ing. Jade, the ho­tel’s quirky Can­tonese restau­rant, is full for its first few lunch sit­tings.</p>
    <p>I am told that the ho­tel’s worka­tion pack­ages are taken up mainly by ex­pa­tri­ates and lo­cal busi­ness­men, in part due to its cen­tral lo­ca­tion. The for­mer Gen­eral Post Of­fice and stomp­ing ground of min­is­ters past seems an apt set­ting for power lunches, I think, as I walk past a se­nior diplo­mat.</p>
    <p>In the af­ter­noon, I watch BBC News, then Phoenix and CCTV News – it is con­sid­ered work to keep abreast of world news.</p>
    <p>Later, I take a call from a col­league to dis­cuss her ar­ti­cle. I ar­range a video call on Google Meet with an­other to see if the room’s Wi-Fi is be­yond re­proach – it is.</p>
    <p>You can get af­ter­noon tea, evening cock­tails and canapes and Chan­don break­fast for a top up of $70++ (Sun­days to Thurs­days) and $130++ (Fri­days, Satur­days and pub­lic hol­i­days) a per­son a day. I in­dulge in scones and sand­wiches at the tea served at The Straits Club lounge.</p>
    <p>Back in my room, I try to keep my blood flow­ing by mov­ing to the bal­cony and then the bed to work.</p>
    <p>It lifts my spir­its to hear the purring of the Ne­spresso ma­chine as I make my­self an­other com­pli­men­tary cof­fee; it makes me smile to see the wel­com­ing toi­let bowl lift its lid au­to­mat­i­cally each time I go near.</p>
    <p>After send­ing some e-mails, I call it a day at around 7pm. I have booked a slot at the ho­tel gym – time, fi­nally, to at­tempt real work.</p>
