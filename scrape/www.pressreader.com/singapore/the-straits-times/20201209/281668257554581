    <p>The Repub­lic is ready to be a hub for the move­ment of Covid-19 vac­cines to the re­gion, with ship­ments from Europe ex­pected to go through Sin­ga­pore to South-east Asia and South-west Pa­cific when broader reg­u­la­tory ap­proval is se­cured.</p>
    <p>Mr Ho Yuen Sang, direc­tor of avi­a­tion in­dus­try at the Civil Avi­a­tion Au­thor­ity of Sin­ga­pore (CAAS), said Sin­ga­pore can play a dis­tri­bu­tion role for ar­eas where in­fra­struc­ture to han­dle large vol­umes of vac­cines may be limited.</p>
    <p>“In such ar­eas, they may pre­fer to take more fre­quent de­liv­ery of their vac­cines in smaller vol­umes so as not to over­whelm their lo­cal cold-chain han­dling ca­pac­ity,” ex­plained Mr Ho.</p>
    <p>Pfizer’s vac­cine needs to be kept at mi­nus 70 deg C, and Moderna’s needs to be stored at mi­nus 20 deg C.</p>
    <p>Mr Ho said Sin­ga­pore’s air con­nec­tiv­ity as well as its abil­ity to store ship­ments at low tem­per­a­tures put it in a good po­si­tion to tem­po­rar­ily store the vac­cines.</p>
    <p>He was speak­ing at a me­dia brief­ing yes­ter­day by the Changi Ready Task­force to ex­plain Sin­ga­pore’s readi­ness to han­dle Covid-19 vac­cine air cargo.</p>
    <p>The task force, co-led by CAAS and Changi Air­port Group (CAG), com­prises 18 mem­bers, in­clud­ing Sin­ga­pore Air­lines (SIA), ground han­dlers, lo­gis­tics part­ners and the au­thor­i­ties.</p>
    <p>On Sin­ga­pore’s abil­ity to main­tain the cold chain, CAG man­ag­ing direc­tor for air hub devel­op­ment Lim Ching Kiat said: “We have placed a lot of em­pha­sis on strength­en­ing Changi’s com­pet­i­tive ad­van­tage in terms of pharma cargo ship­ment. So Changi Air­port has es­pe­cially in re­cent years be­come the key pre­ferred hub for phar­ma­ceu­ti­cal ship­ments.”</p>
    <p>A dozen firms in the Changi air hub have re­ceived in­ter­na­tional cer­ti­fi­ca­tion for phar­ma­ceu­ti­cal han­dling, and ground han­dlers Sats and dnata have also in­vested in ca­pa­bil­i­ties to main­tain an un­bro­ken cold chain.</p>
    <p>The task force said that SIA also op­er­ates mul­ti­ple weekly flights to key Euro­pean phar­ma­ceu­ti­cal hubs, such as Am­s­ter­dam, Brus­sels and Frank­furt, and has a wide net­work in South-east Asia and South­west Pa­cific, which in­cludes Aus­tralia and New Zealand.</p>
    <p>The first batch of Pfizer’s vac­cine is be­ing man­u­fac­tured in the Bel­gian town of Pu­urs and will be trans­ported from Brus­sels.</p>
    <p>Ma­jor lo­gis­tics play­ers such as DHL, FedEx and UPS also have re­gional hubs in Sin­ga­pore with strong net­work con­nec­tiv­ity from Changi Air­port, noted the task force.</p>
    <p>Mr Lim said: “Changi Air­port, to­gether with the au­thor­i­ties, will be try­ing to en­gage some of the key ship­pers to sell the strengths of the Changi air hub as a whole, how we have ex­pe­ri­ence in han­dling phar­ma­ceu­ti­cals, and for this ex­er­cise we will do it in a safe man­ner.”</p>
    <p>The move to po­si­tion Sin­ga­pore as a hub to dis­trib­ute vac­cine cargo to the re­gion comes amid a growth in cargo han­dling.</p>
    <p>CAG said cargo flights at Changi Air­port have tripled from end-2019 to 950 flights weekly as of Dec 1 with about 80 cities con­nected through these cargo flights.</p>
    <p>On the sig­nif­i­cance of Changi work­ing to be a hub for the dis­tri­bu­tion of Covid-19 vac­cines, Mr Lim said it rep­re­sents a hu­man­i­tar­ian ef­fort and helps bring cargo busi­ness to the air­port.</p>
    <p>He added: “The wide­spread vac­cine dis­tri­bu­tion is a very key part to the re­cov­ery of pas­sen­ger travel, so we also have a very vested in­ter­est to make sure that.... vac­cine (dis­tri­bu­tion) is made as ef­fi­cient and as quick as pos­si­ble.”</p>
