    <p>Ed­i­to­rial</p>
    <p>The States­man, In­dia</p>
    <p>The death of an 80-year-old man, af­ter his ad­mo­ni­tion to a fel­low bar pa­tron to wear a face mask re­sulted in an al­ter­ca­tion, high­lights, in a sense, a crit­i­cal fault line in Amer­i­can so­ci­ety that has its ge­n­e­sis in the White House.</p>
    <p>For, ever since the epi­demic gripped North Amer­ica, Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump has dis­played only oc­ca­sional in­ter­est in fol­low­ing safety pro­to­cols, an af­flic­tion that now ap­pears to have gripped many Amer­i­cans, es­pe­cially those of his fol­low­ers who see the im­po­si­tions as an as­sault on their free­dom.</p>
    <p>The death in Buf­falo, New York, of a for­mer Ma­rine caps a se­ries of vi­o­lent con­fronta­tions be­tween Amer­i­cans who ad­here to safety norms and those who do not wish to do so. Dis­putes have of­ten turned vi­o­lent in stores and some­times even hos­pi­tals.</p>
    <p>These in­ci­dents speak of a so­ci­ety on the edge.</p>
    <p>The con­se­quences of Pres­i­dent Trump’s cav­a­lier ap­proach to safety pro­to­cols have al­ready vis­ited the White House, making the world’s most pow­er­ful of­fice-cum-res­i­dence its most prom­i­nent con­tain­ment zone.</p>
    <p>His re­turn from the Wal­ter Reed hos­pi­tal af­ter four days and three nights has thrown the White House into fresh frenzy, with more than a dozen staff hav­ing tested pos­i­tive for the virus and the West Wing wear­ing a de­serted look even as polls sug­gest that a bid for re-elec­tion is fast slip­ping away from Mr Trump.</p>
    <p>He has been crit­i­cised for al­most ev­ery as­pect of his con­duct – and that of his of­fi­cials – af­ter test­ing pos­i­tive for the virus.</p>
    <p>His drive out of the hos­pi­tal to greet sup­port­ers drew flak for the risks to which it ex­posed Se­cret Ser­vice agents tasked with pro­tect­ing him, and the at­tempts by his physi­cian to down­play his symp­toms were widely crit­i­cised as acts of dis­hon­esty.</p>
    <p>As some Amer­i­cans have pointed out, a good boss ought to look out for his em­ploy­ees, and they say Mr Trump has failed those who pledged their loy­alty and ser­vice to him. In ad­di­tion, it is this widely per­ceived self­ish­ness that might sink his chances at next month’s elec­tion. There are but days to go for the polls, but Mr Trump’s prospects are be­gin­ning to look as frag­ile as his health.</p>
    <p>The can­celled visit</p>
    <p>Ed­i­to­rial</p>
    <p>The Korea Her­ald, South Korea</p>
    <p>The news of US Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump hav­ing con­tracted the coro­n­avirus has prompted con­cerns here over the ef­fect his ill­ness could have on the se­cu­rity sit­u­a­tion on the penin­sula, with in­ter-Korean ties strained amid stalled de­nu­cle­ari­sa­tion talks be­tween Wash­ing­ton and Py­ongyang.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump catch­ing the coro­n­avirus ap­pears to have ruled out a sur­pris­ing diplo­matic event with Py­ongyang ahead of the US pres­i­den­tial elec­tion on Nov 3.</p>
    <p>A re­cent string of vis­its to Wash­ing­ton by se­nior South Korean of­fi­cials, in­clud­ing top nu­clear en­voy Lee Do-hoon, sparked spec­u­la­tion that Seoul was try­ing to help ar­range yet another sum­mit be­tween Mr Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.</p>
    <p>Ex­perts here also raised the pos­si­bil­ity of Ms Kim Yo Jong, the in­creas­ingly pow­er­ful sis­ter of the North’s dic­ta­tor, trav­el­ling to Wash­ing­ton this month to con­vey a mes­sage to Mr Trump from her brother.</p>
    <p>South Korean Pres­i­dent Moon Jae-in and his aides have been ea­ger to see the re­sump­tion of high-level con­tacts be­tween the United States and the North, which they hope will ad­vance their agenda for peace on the penin­sula.</p>
    <p>They may have wanted to hear, dur­ing the planned visit to Seoul of US Sec­re­tary of State Mike Pom­peo, that Wash­ing­ton in­tended to set up a big diplo­matic event with Py­ongyang.</p>
    <p>In­stead, the US State</p>
    <p>Depart­ment an­nounced the can­cel­la­tion of the visit in the wake of Mr Trump’s dis­clo­sure in a tweet that he and his wife had tested pos­i­tive for Covid-19.</p>
    <p>The state­ment by the US State Depart­ment said Mr Pom­peo ex­pected to travel to Asia again within this month.</p>
    <p>The aim of the resched­uled visit, which might be pre­ceded by Chi­nese For­eign Min­is­ter Wang Yi’s trip to Seoul, is more likely to cen­tre on draw­ing South Korea into the global frame­work the US is build­ing with like-minded coun­tries against China.</p>
    <p>Mr Moon’s push for declar­ing a for­mal end to the 1950-53 Korean War, which ended with an armistice, is also ex­pected to lose steam.</p>
    <p>The jolt from Mr Trump’s coro­n­avirus di­ag­no­sis might well re­mind South Korean of­fi­cials of the im­por­tance of a firm al­liance with the US in deal­ing with the nu­clear-armed North.</p>
    <p>Elec­toral game changer</p>
    <p>An­drew Ko­ry­bko China Daily, China</p>
    <p>Amer­i­can po­lit­i­cal com­men­ta­tors rou­tinely spec­u­late on the trend of so-called “Oc­to­ber sur­prises” that tend to pop up the month be­fore each pres­i­den­tial elec­tion.</p>
    <p>This term usu­ally refers to a po­ten­tially game-chang­ing de­vel­op­ment, in most cases a con­tro­ver­sial re­port by one’s party against its ri­val, which has the chance to greatly in­flu­ence the out­come of the up­com­ing vote.</p>
    <p>This year, Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump’s Covid-19 di­ag­no­sis ful­fils that role, which could cre­ate both ob­sta­cles and op­por­tu­ni­ties for his re-elec­tion.</p>
    <p>His well-known per­sonal views of pre­vi­ously scoff­ing at the se­ri­ous­ness of this pan­demic prior to do­ing an about-face and claim­ing to have taken it se­ri­ously this en­tire time will now be chal­lenged to their core.</p>
    <p>Should he rapidly re­cover with no com­pli­ca­tions or pos­si­bly only min­i­mal ones, then he might con­tinue to down­play the dis­ease and al­lege that the Democrats want to lock Amer­ica down for po­lit­i­cal rea­sons.</p>
    <p>That sce­nario could have a tremen­dous im­pact on the elec­tion and might co­in­cide with the fi­nal days of the cam­paign sea­son.</p>
    <p>That would not give the Cen­tres for Dis­ease Con­trol and Preven­tion nor the Democrats enough time to con­vinc­ingly counter his nar­ra­tive.</p>
    <p>Many Amer­i­cans are al­ready re­cep­tive to it and those who are still on the fence about who to vote for in the com­ing elec­tion might be in­flu­enced to sup­port him, since they would be led to think that he is a liv­ing tes­ta­ment of why this pan­demic is not as se­ri­ous as many sci­en­tists say it is.</p>
    <p>One way or another, Covid-19 has once again be­come the pri­mary fac­tor de­ter­min­ing if Mr Trump will be re-elected.</p>
    <p>His re­turn from the Wal­ter Reed hos­pi­tal af­ter four days and three nights has thrown the White House into fresh frenzy, with more than a dozen staff hav­ing tested pos­i­tive for the virus and the West Wing wear­ing a de­serted look even as polls sug­gest that a bid for re-elec­tion is fast slip­ping away from Mr Trump.</p>
