    <p>NEW YORK • When a young tech en­trepreneur with a his­tory of do­ing busi­ness in Nige­ria and Bangladesh was found dis­mem­bered last week in his mul­ti­mil­lion-dol­lar Man­hat­tan con­do­minium, the case at first seemed to have all the trap­pings of an in­ter­na­tional thriller.</p>
    <p>Some­one in a black suit, a mask and la­tex gloves had fol­lowed the vic­tim, Mr Fahim Saleh, into his apart­ment while car­ry­ing a duf­fel bag, a security video showed. The per­son then sub­dued Mr Saleh with a Taser, stabbed him to death and re­turned the next day to dis­mem­ber him with an electric saw, ac­cord­ing to the po­lice.</p>
    <p>One law en­force­ment of­fi­cial said it “looked like a pro­fes­sional job”.</p>
    <p>But, po­lice said, in­stead of lead­ing de­tec­tives to­wards Mr Saleh’s over­seas busi­ness projects, the ev­i­dence quickly pointed to some­one close to home: his one-time per­sonal as­sis­tant.</p>
    <p>On Fri­day, the for­mer as­sis­tant, Tyrese Devon Haspil, 21, was ar­rested and charged with mur­der­ing Mr Saleh, 33. Some in­ves­ti­ga­tors the­o­rised that the sus­pect had tried to make the killing look like a pro­fes­sional as­sas­si­na­tion to di­vert at­ten­tion from him­self.</p>
    <p>“Mr Haspil was Mr Saleh’s ex­ec­u­tive as­sis­tant and han­dled his fi­nances and per­sonal mat­ters,” chief of de­tec­tives Rod­ney Har­ri­son said on Fri­day af­ter­noon. “It is also be­lieved that he owed the vic­tim a sig­nif­i­cant amount of money.”</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to three of­fi­cials briefed on the mat­ter, Mr Saleh had dis­cov­ered that Haspil had stolen roughly US$90,000 (S$125,000) from him.</p>
    <p>Al­though Mr Saleh, who friends said was a gen­er­ous man, fired Haspil, he did not re­port the theft, the of­fi­cials said. He even of­fered to ar­range a way for his for­mer em­ployee to work off his debt in what amounted to a pay­ment plan.</p>
    <p>Haspil, a Long Is­land na­tive who had re­cently at­tended Hof­s­tra Univer­sity, was ar­rested at 8.45am on Fri­day at the lobby of a build­ing in SoHo, where he had been stay­ing in an apart­ment with a fe­male friend, one of­fi­cial said. New York de­tec­tives and fed­eral agents from a US Mar­shals Ser­vice re­gional fugi­tive task force took him into cus­tody.</p>
    <p>Haspil had worked for Mr Saleh since he was 16, ac­cord­ing to of­fi­cials with knowl­edge of the in­ves­ti­ga­tion. One of the of­fi­cials said Mr Saleh had paid Haspil so well that he had been able to pay off the debts of sev­eral fam­ily mem­bers.</p>
    <p>Mr Saleh was dis­cov­ered dead on Tues­day, when his cousin checked on him at his US$2.25 mil­lion condo in a lux­ury build­ing on East Hous­ton Street on the Lower East Side af­ter not hear­ing from him for a day.</p>
    <p>At the scene, Mr Saleh’s head and limbs had been re­moved, and parts of his body had been placed in large plas­tic bags de­signed for con­struc­tion de­bris. An electric saw was still plugged in nearby.</p>
    <p>He died from mul­ti­ple stab wounds to his neck and torso, the New York City med­i­cal ex­am­iner’s of­fice de­ter­mined on Thurs­day.</p>
    <p>In­ves­ti­ga­tors said he was killed on Mon­day af­ter­noon. The killer used a Taser to im­mo­bilise Mr Saleh in a lift and then stabbed him to death, po­lice said.</p>
    <p>A security video taken from in­side the lift showed that the killer later used a por­ta­ble vac­uum cleaner, per­haps in an ef­fort to re­move the par­ti­cles left be­hind when the Taser was fired, the of­fi­cials said. He also used the vac­uum cleaner in­side the apart­ment.</p>
    <p>Af­ter the killing, the sus­pect used a credit card to hire a car to go to a Home De­pot, on West 23rd Street in Man­hat­tan, and to buy clean­ing sup­plies, ac­cord­ing to the of­fi­cials.</p>
    <p>He re­turned to Mr Saleh’s apart­ment the next day, plan­ning to dis­mem­ber the body and clean up the crime scene, but was in­ter­rupted when Mr Saleh’s cousin buzzed from the build­ing’s lobby, prompt­ing him to flee through the back door and into a stair­well.</p>
    <p>Mr Saleh’s fam­ily said in a state­ment on Wed­nes­day that the grue­some killing was so shock­ing it was un­fath­omable.</p>
    <p>“Fahim is more than what you are read­ing,” the fam­ily said. “He is so much more. His bril­liant and in­no­va­tive mind took ev­ery­one who was a part of his world on a jour­ney and he made sure never to leave any­one be­hind.”</p>
    <p>Mr Saleh was born in Saudi Ara­bia to Bangladesh­i par­ents who set­tled near Pough­keep­sie, New York, a small city on the Hud­son River. Af­ter grad­u­at­ing from Bent­ley Univer­sity in Waltham, Mas­sachusetts, in 2009, he built an app called PrankDial that al­lowed users to send pre-recorded prank calls.</p>
    <p>He went on to found Pathao, a mo­tor­cy­cle ride-shar­ing start-up in Bangladesh, and left the firm in 2018 to be­gin a sim­i­lar ven­ture in Nige­ria, an app known as Gokada.</p>
    <p>At the time of his death, Mr Saleh was the chief ex­ec­u­tive of Gokada.</p>
    <p>Mr Haspil was Mr Saleh’s ex­ec­u­tive as­sis­tant and han­dled his fi­nances and per­sonal mat­ters. It is also be­lieved that he owed the vic­tim a sig­nif­i­cant ’’ amount of money.</p>
    <p>CHIEF OF DE­TEC­TIVES ROD­NEY HAR­RI­SON, on the re­la­tion­ship be­tween the sus­pect and the vic­tim. BRIL­LIANT MIND</p>
    <p>Fahim is more than what you are read­ing. He is so much more. His bril­liant and in­no­va­tive mind took ev­ery­one who was a part of his world on a jour­ney and he made sure never to ’’ leave any­one be­hind.</p>
