    <p>Sin­ga­porean chil­dren re­turn­ing from over­seas who plan to en­rol in sec­ondary schools or ju­nior col­leges here next year will be able to send in their ap­pli­ca­tions from to­day, the Min­istry of Ed­u­ca­tion (MOE) said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The School Place­ment Ex­er­cise for Re­turn­ing Sin­ga­pore­ans (Spers) is an an­nual ex­er­cise held to­wards the end of each year and com­prises a set of cen­tralised tests for Sin­ga­pore­ans seek­ing ad­mis­sion into a lo­cal school af­ter hav­ing lived or stud­ied abroad.</p>
    <p>The tests for those seek­ing ad­mis­sion to Sec­ondary 1 to 3 will be held from Sept 22 to 24, while the tests for Pre-Univer­sity 1 will be held on Nov 12. No tests will be con­ducted for stu­dents at the Sec­ondary 4 and Pre-Univer­sity 2 lev­els, as these are na­tional ex­am­i­na­tion years and re­turn­ing stu­dents gen­er­ally do not re-en­ter the school sys­tem at these lev­els, MOE said.</p>
    <p>Ap­pli­cants will re­ceive their school place­ment re­sults in De­cem­ber and will be able to join their school at the start of the first school term next year.</p>
    <p>There will be a sec­ond round of ap­pli­ca­tions in Oc­to­ber for chil­dren who are un­able to re­turn in time for the tests in Septem­ber.</p>
    <p>MOE said the tests for these ap­pli­cants are ten­ta­tively sched­uled for mid-De­cem­ber, with ap­pli­cants ex­pected to re­ceive their re­sults by next Fe­bru­ary.</p>
    <p>The min­istry added that in view of the Covid-19 sit­u­a­tion, Spers will be sub­jected to na­tional safe man­age­ment mea­sures in place lead­ing up to and dur­ing the test dates.</p>
    <p>“In this re­gard, MOE would en­cour­age (re­turn­ing Sin­ga­porean) chil­dren who are seek­ing a place in any suit­able school near their Sin­ga­pore res­i­dence to make use of MOE’s As­sured School Place­ment ser­vice,” said a min­istry spokesman.</p>
    <p>The As­sured School Place­ment ser­vice se­cures ad­mis­sion for re­turn­ing Sin­ga­porean chil­dren into a school with va­can­cies near their res­i­dence be­fore they re­turn.</p>
    <p>Chil­dren who make use of this ser­vice do not have to sit any cen­tralised tests.</p>
