    <p>In the last year, social distancing has be­come part of ev­ery­day life, in a bid to curb the spread of the coron­avirus.</p>
    <p>Yet, amid the iso­la­tion, sep­a­ra­tion and seclu­sion that char­ac­terised 2020, some Sin­ga­pore­ans have suc­ceeded in mak­ing new friends and main­tain­ing – or even strength­en­ing – ties with ex­ist­ing ones.</p>
    <p>Path­light School grad­u­ate Damian Quah, 16, who has autism spec­trum dis­or­der (ASD), made one new friend: Mr Jackie Chionh, 31, a one-handed ma­gi­cian who is also a track and field para-ath­lete.</p>
    <p>Damian had not made any new friends for most of the year due to Covid-19 re­stric­tions and be­cause he was busy study­ing for his Nlevel ex­am­i­na­tions.</p>
    <p>In Oc­to­ber, his mother Clau­dia Khoo, 41, an ex­ec­u­tive work­ing in a char­ity, in­tro­duced him to Mr Chionh, whom she got to know through work, as she felt it would be good for Damian to have a role model. She is a mem­ber of the Friends Of ASD Fam­i­lies Face­book group, which sup­ports fam­i­lies rais­ing chil­dren with ASD.</p>
    <p>As a child, Mr Chionh sus­tained a brain in­jury that af­fected the nerves re­lated to the right side of his body, though he can now per­form tasks such as writ­ing, eat­ing and brush­ing his teeth us­ing only his left hand.</p>
    <p>Over a video call, he and Damian bonded over their shared love of sports and ex­er­cise. Last Sun­day, he vis­ited Damian at home and the two did ex­er­cises such as squats and flut­ter kicks.</p>
    <p>Damian says of Mr Chionh: “He is very en­cour­ag­ing and I hope I can be­come just as fit as him.”</p>
    <p>Mr Chionh says: “I am glad Damian finds my story in­spir­ing and I am happy to be his friend.”</p>
    <p>For ex­ist­ing friends, be­ing apart felt ag­o­nis­ing. Col­leagues and lunch bud­dies Chloe Lim, 33, and Amanda Seow, 28, were dis­mayed that they were al­lo­cated to dif­fer­ent teams dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker pe­riod and could not meet.</p>
    <p>The pair, who work in elec­tric­ity re­tailer Geneco’s mar­ket­ing de­part­ment un­der power gen­er­a­tion com­pany YTL Pow­erSer­aya, re­sorted to tex­ting on What­sApp daily and speak­ing over Zoom once a week.</p>
    <p>They also sur­prised each other with food de­liv­er­ies of ice cream, bub­ble tea and fried chicken, and kept each other mo­ti­vated to ex­er­cise reg­u­larly at home.</p>
    <p>When they were fi­nally able to re­turn to the of­fice in Septem­ber, they were ec­static.</p>
    <p>Ms Lim says: “We re­ally missed each other. Tech­nol­ogy helped us main­tain our friend­ship and stay pos­i­tive dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker. But noth­ing beats see­ing each other face to face and we are glad we can have lunch to­gether again.”</p>
    <p>Since the start of the pan­demic, many groups have launched ini­tia­tives to help people form new friend­ships and com­mu­nity bonds.</p>
    <p>Social en­ter­prise Hap­pi­ness Ini­tia­tive, for ex­am­ple, started the</p>
    <p>Hap­pi­ness Net­work, a com­mu­nity of people in­ter­ested in learn­ing about the science of hap­pi­ness and well-be­ing.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker, the net­work met vir­tu­ally on Zoom ev­ery Thurs­day to dis­cuss a re­search ar­ti­cle on the topic and get to know one another.</p>
    <p>Univer­sity stu­dent Serene Soon, 23, at­tended four ses­sions. She felt they al­lowed her to delve into a sub­ject she was keen to learn more about, as well as join a com­mu­nity which shared her in­ter­est.</p>
    <p>She says: “Ini­tially, I was just dis­cussing ideas with a group of strangers on­line. But as the weeks passed, th­ese strangers be­came fa­mil­iar faces and my iso­la­tion was slowly re­placed with a warmth that came from be­long­ing to a com­mu­nity – formed dur­ing Covid-19, no less.”</p>
    <p>At social ser­vice agency Lions Be­frien­ders, which aims to pro­vide friend­ship and care for se­niors through com­mu­nity par­tic­i­pa­tion, staff worked around the clock dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker,</p>
    <p>mak­ing phone calls at least twice a week to more than 6,000 se­niors to en­sure they were safe and up­dated on the lat­est ad­vi­sories.</p>
    <p>Lions Be­frien­ders chair­man An­thony Tay says se­niors who coped bet­ter would look for­ward to th­ese calls and con­verse with the staff for 20 to 30 min­utes each time.</p>
    <p>Those who did not cope as well tended to break down over the phone, re­quest­ing vis­i­ta­tions in­stead of phone calls.</p>
    <p>But most se­niors un­der­stood the mea­sures were nec­es­sary to pro­tect them, he adds.</p>
    <p>Last year, the agency also part­nered DBS Bank in July and Au­gust to roll out a vir­tual be­friend­ing vol­un­teer ini­tia­tive, where 1,000 DBS em­ploy­ees en­gaged 1,000 se­nior ben­e­fi­cia­ries through vir­tual con­ver­sa­tions, on­line games, sing-along ses­sions and sim­ple home gardening projects.</p>
    <p>“The pro­gramme gave our se­niors a sense of pur­pose as they em­braced tech­nol­ogy,” says Mr Tay.</p>
    <p>“Ul­ti­mately, we hope to en­able se­niors to en­joy mean­ing­ful and en­rich­ing lives.”</p>
    <p>Grass­roots lead­ers have also con­tin­ued with their out­reach pro­grammes, such as con­duct­ing house vis­its and de­liv­er­ing es­sen­tial items to needy res­i­dents, while prac­tis­ing safe distancing and good hy­giene.</p>
    <p>For ex­am­ple, Mr Giriesh Gopal Kr­ish­nan, chair­man of Brad­dell Heights Com­mu­nity Club’s In­dian Ac­tiv­ity Ex­ec­u­tive Com­mit­tee, has be­friended new res­i­dents in the Brad­dell Heights es­tate – vis­it­ing them, in­tro­duc­ing them to var­i­ous com­mu­nity pro­grammes and talk­ing to them about govern­ment ini­tia­tives.</p>
    <p>The 33-year-old says: “Last year was a chal­leng­ing one for many res­i­dents. So it was very im­por­tant for me and my team of vol­un­teers to make time to in­ter­act with them to make sure ev­ery­thing was fine. Af­ter all, we are neigh­bours.”</p>
