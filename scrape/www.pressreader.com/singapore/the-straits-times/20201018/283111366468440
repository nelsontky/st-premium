    <p>You prob­a­bly think that the most im­por­tant per­son in a restau­rant is the chef. Af­ter all, a good one can make ex­cel­lent dishes that will at­tract hordes of hungry din­ers.</p>
    <p>But it seems not all chefs are equal – some of those in dim sum restau­rants in China have be­come the first batch of work­ers to get the boot be­cause they are be­ing re­placed by ma­chines that can sup­pos­edly churn out dumplings that are just as good.</p>
    <p>A key rea­son is that these chefs earn the high­est pay – some 10,000 yuan (S$2,000) a month com­pared with wait­ers, who earn about 1,600 yuan.</p>
    <p>To save on costs, these restau­rants turn to dumpling ma­chines, which cost only 26,800 yuan apiece. The ma­chines do not need rest or staff wel­fare and even come with a one-year guar­an­tee for break­downs.</p>
    <p>Their man­u­fac­tur­ers note that so long as you key in the cor­rect por­tions of in­gre­di­ents, the ma­chines can roll out dumplings with a con­sis­tency in qual­ity that an av­er­age chef will find hard to match all day.</p>
    <p>Though it may be con­sid­ered sac­ri­lege to use such a ma­chine to re­place the top chefs of fine din­ing restau­rants, own­ers of chain eater­ies are happy to em­brace such tech­nol­ogy as it means im­me­di­ate sav­ings of al­most 98,000 yuan a year per chef.</p>
    <p>That is only in year one – so long as the ma­chine con­tin­ues to func­tion, it will con­tinue to save more on wages.</p>
    <p>What about the wait­ers? Some restau­rants in China are also re­plac­ing them with ro­bot servers, not be­cause they are cheaper, but be­cause it is a job shunned by many peo­ple.</p>
    <p>It costs about 3,000 yuan a month to rent a ro­bot that can take food to ta­bles.</p>
    <p>In­deed, many restau­rants pre­fer hu­mans to robots as wait­ers, es­pe­cially if they can pro­vide great ser­vice that can charm reg­u­lar cus­tomers back of­ten.</p>
    <p>While it may still be years be­fore robots can ef­fec­tively re­place hu­man work­ers, the ex­pe­ri­ence in China should make both em­ploy­ers and work­ers here pon­der over how tech­nol­ogy and in­no­va­tion can be used to in­crease pro­duc­tiv­ity and save on man­power costs.</p>
    <p>This is es­pe­cially so if cer­tain jobs are seen as less de­sir­able.</p>
    <p>It brings to mind the re­cent de­bate on whether Sin­ga­pore should have a min­i­mum wage pol­icy so that me­nial work­ers such as clean­ers can be a paid a base salary that is man­dated by law.</p>
    <p>Though the in­ten­tion to pay low­in­come work­ers more is a no­ble one, any le­gal in­ter­ven­tion to em­ploy­ers’ in­her­ent rights to run their own busi­nesses is likely to pro­duce un­de­sir­able re­sults.</p>
    <p>As­sis­tant Pro­fes­sor Justin Le­ung of the Depart­ment of Strat­egy and Pol­icy at the Na­tional Univer­sity of Sin­ga­pore Busi­ness School says that even if there is a min­i­mum wage pol­icy, there is noth­ing stop­ping em­ploy­ers from ad­just­ing to the changes to ame­lio­rate the in­crease in labour costs.</p>
    <p>For in­stance, in­creas­ing min­i­mum wages in the United States has led to em­ploy­ers of­fer­ing part-time op­tions to the same em­ploy­ees or even cut­ting back staff num­bers.</p>
    <p>In­come aside – even if the pay is rea­son­able, as it is in China – how many of to­day’s young peo­ple would want to take on “min­i­mum wage” jobs?</p>
    <p>No one as­pires to be a cleaner in old age, but there is no guar­an­tee that there will not be a new gen­er­a­tion of clean­ers in a decade or two if to­day’s younger folks are not care­ful in sav­ing and re­tire­ment plan­ning.</p>
    <p>If so, the key ques­tion that all em­ploy­ees should ask is: How can I fu­ture­proof my­self?</p>
    <p>Take two of the most pop­u­lar gig econ­omy jobs favoured by many young peo­ple – driv­ing for ride-hail­ing com­pa­nies and de­liv­er­ing for ecom­merce firms.</p>
    <p>If you have been keep­ing up with the news, you would know that the ul­ti­mate aim of these com­pa­nies is to have self-driv­ing au­ton­o­mous ve­hi­cles as well as drones that will be able to de­liver to cus­tomers di­rectly.</p>
    <p>This sce­nario may still be years away, but are these work­ers pre­pared for such a re­al­ity?</p>
    <p>The money may be good now – some re­port­edly earn $6,000 or more a month – but any fi­nan­cial plan­ner will tell you that such free­lance jobs are not sus­tain­able in the long run.</p>
    <p>NO EM­PLOY­MENT BEN­E­FITS</p>
    <p>Gig work­ers are con­sid­ered self-em­ployed and thus do not en­joy Cen­tral Prov­i­dent Fund (CPF) con­tri­bu­tions and med­i­cal cov­er­age that nor­mal em­ploy­ees re­ceive. They also have no an­nual leave, and there­fore no in­come on the days they do not work.</p>
    <p>So they would do well to make CPF con­tri­bu­tions for them­selves or risk not hav­ing a safety net if they do not save enough for old age.</p>
    <p>NO JOB PRO­MO­TIONS</p>
    <p>Long-serv­ing drivers and de­liv­ery men will not hit man­age­rial grades</p>
    <p>that are of­ten open to ex­pe­ri­enced em­ploy­ees. In­deed, for such jobs, age is a weak­ness, as the older they are, the less likely they will be able to work longer hours.</p>
    <p>Un­like nor­mal em­ploy­ees who ex­pect ca­reer and in­come pro­gres­sion with ex­pe­ri­ence, gig work­ers are likely to see their in­comes de­cline as they age.</p>
    <p>Does this mean that these are dead-end jobs?</p>
    <p>Not nec­es­sar­ily, if such work­ers heed the na­tional call to reskill, up­grade and do bet­ter, as this will pro­vide an op­por­tu­nity for a new ca­reer, even as one door closes.</p>
    <p>If the com­pe­ti­tion is likely to come from self-driv­ing ve­hi­cles, then hu­mans should look into how they can per­form tasks be­yond fer­ry­ing peo­ple and goods from one point to an­other.</p>
    <p>Per­haps Sin­ga­pore work­ers can again take a leaf out of China’s book – the lock­downs amid the pan­demic have given rise to a new kind of job – con­do­minium but­lers who help in all kinds of er­rands and house­hold chores for res­i­dents.</p>
    <p>These jobs are very high in de­mand now as many con­do­mini­ums across the coun­try are rush­ing to set up such ser­vices, spark­ing a share mar­ket boom for em­ploy­ment com­pa­nies.</p>
    <p>The in­come for such work­ers is likely to be de­cent since there is such high de­mand. Good work­ers are ex­pected to earn even more if they re­ceive gen­er­ous tips from happy cus­tomers.</p>
    <p>While the con­cept of condo but­lers may not take off here yet, the idea of a per­sonal concierge may be rel­e­vant as the Sin­ga­pore pop­u­la­tion ages.</p>
    <p>Imag­ine call­ing for a driver who will not only drive you to meet your friends, but will also help you do your shop­ping and other er­rands while you are hav­ing fun.</p>
    <p>Many re­tired bosses, who can af­ford to pay, will cer­tainly see the ben­e­fits of such ad hoc ser­vices as they have grown used to be­ing served and driven around.</p>
    <p>The les­son here is that fu­ture­proof­ing means look­ing ahead and iden­ti­fy­ing the value and ben­e­fits you can pro­vide that will make you bet­ter than robots.</p>
    <p>So if you truly like driv­ing, why not train to be a “trans­porter” – the fic­tional su­per­driver-cum-body­guard for hire made fa­mous by ac­tion star Ja­son Statham, who of­ten saves the day for his pas­sen­gers?</p>
    <p>Now which bil­lion­aire will not pay top dol­lar to have you by his side?</p>
