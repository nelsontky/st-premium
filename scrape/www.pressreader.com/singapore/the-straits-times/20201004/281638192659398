    <p>That Pres­i­dent Donald Trump has been hos­pi­talised with Covid-19 has changed the con­ver­sa­tion of the week to the pan­demic, which con­tin­ues to rav­age the United States.</p>
    <p>For him, that is a dou­ble-edged sword. Much as the Pres­i­dent tries to blame China and play up his early ban on trav­ellers from that coun­try, the coro­n­avirus is a sore point, a vul­ner­a­bil­ity.</p>
    <p>He is al­ready tak­ing blame for bring­ing this upon him­self while putting oth­ers at risk, tempt­ing fate by min­gling with aides and ad­vis­ers, some­times with­out masks.</p>
    <p>The Sept 26 White House event to nom­i­nate Ms Amy Coney Bar­rett to the Supreme Court, where un­masked guests min­gled and hugged, is turn­ing out to be a su­per-spreader with seven at­ten­dees in­fected so far. The list of vi­o­la­tions of rec­om­mended pro­to­cols is a long one.</p>
    <p>To top it all, dur­ing the de­bate in Cleve­land last Tues­day, he mocked for­mer vice-pres­i­dent Joe Bi­den for wear­ing a mask.</p>
    <p>On Fri­day, jour­nal­ist Amelia Thom­son-DeVeaux, se­nior writer at the Five Thirty Eight po­lit­i­cal an­a­lyt­ics web­site, said: “A big part of the rea­son Repub­li­cans are not as into Covid-19 re­stric­tions is that they are much, much less likely to view the virus as a per­sonal health threat.”</p>
    <p>And it is Mr Trump who has been the sin­gle largest driver of false and mis­lead­ing in­for­ma­tion about the coro­n­avirus, Cor­nell</p>
    <p>Univer­sity re­searchers said in a study last week.</p>
    <p>“Trump’s ap­proval on his han­dling of the pan­demic was al­ready dis­mal,” wrote po­lit­i­cal an­a­lyst Tae­gan God­dard, founder of the news­let­ter Po­lit­i­cal Wire.</p>
    <p>“Now, at­ten­tion will be re­fo­cused on his per­sonal reck­less­ness that put oth­ers at risk. Video clips of Trump down­play­ing the pan­demic are end­less.”</p>
    <p>There is, thus, plenty of am­mu­ni­tion to use against him, and this episode high­lights his fail­ures.</p>
    <p>Covid-19 in­fec­tions are tick­ing up again. Last week, Dr An­thony</p>
    <p>Fauci, di­rec­tor of the Na­tional In­sti­tute of Al­lergy and In­fec­tious Dis­eases, said: “We’re look­ing at 40,000 new cases per day.”</p>
    <p>Mean­while, al­le­ga­tions – which he has re­jected – that Mr Trump has paid little or no in­come tax, that he in­sulted Amer­ica’s war dead, that the First Lady in a tape record­ing de­rided Christ­mas, and his de­bate per­for­mance, have all been booted from the news cy­cle.</p>
    <p>In fact, there is a the­ory in some lib­eral cir­cles that Mr Trump is not in­fected at all; that it is an elab­o­rate ploy to de­lay the elec­tion or emerge a hero from a bout of Covid-19.</p>
    <p>Echo­ing this, film-maker Michael Moore, who in 2016 pre­dicted Mr Trump’s win when few oth­ers did, wrote on Fri­day on Face­book: “There is one ab­so­lute truth about Trump: He is a ... se­rial liar.</p>
    <p>“The only ques­tion we re­ally need to be ask­ing is this: Why would Trump all of a sud­den just start telling the truth?”</p>
    <p>The Trump cam­paign is now busy mov­ing the cam­paign­ing on­line.</p>
    <p>On the cards are phone and video calls – and mak­ing Vice-Pres­i­dent Mike Pence step up cam­paign­ing (he faces Se­na­tor Ka­mala Har­ris in their only de­bate on Wed­nes­day) to keep up the mo­men­tum.</p>
    <p>But much is pred­i­cated on an un­known – Mr Trump’s con­di­tion.</p>
    <p>If he emerges un­scathed, he will be em­bold­ened, and his heroic im­age with his de­voted base, which sees him as a sort of glad­i­a­to­rial fig­ure, will only be re­in­forced.</p>
    <p>This may not get him any sig­nif­i­cant wave of sym­pa­thy votes from be­yond his base; Amer­i­cans’ minds are largely made up al­ready. But it will not hurt him. In na­tional polls he has been con­sis­tently, al­beit nar­rowly, be­hind Mr Bi­den.</p>
    <p>Separately, poll data cruncher Nate Silver, founder of the Five Thirty Eight site, said: “Covid-19 is a huge li­a­bil­ity for the Pres­i­dent, and so plac­ing more fo­cus on (it) prob­a­bly isn’t great for him.”</p>
    <p>Ms Thom­son-DeVeaux noted: “I think what hap­pens with pub­lic opinion re­ally de­pends on how sick Trump gets.</p>
    <p>It could play out at least two ways, she said: “Trump gets mod­er­ately or very sick and this does prompt Repub­li­cans to think ... this ac­tu­ally is se­ri­ous and if it could hap­pen to Trump it could hap­pen to me.”</p>
    <p>Or “Trump re­mains mostly asymp­to­matic and it bol­sters the idea that this is ac­tu­ally not such a big deal”.</p>
    <p>Mr Moore wrote: “He’s los­ing the elec­tion. And he knows it. It’s not 2016. He was hated in 2016, but he’s hated even more now.”</p>
    <p>But Democrats, lib­er­als, the me­dia and oth­ers have al­ways been wrong to sim­ply treat Mr Trump as a buf­foon, he wrote.</p>
    <p>“He’s also canny. He knows be­ing sick tends to gain one sym­pa­thy. He’s not above weapon­is­ing this.”</p>
