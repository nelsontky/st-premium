    <p>LON­DON • Bri­tain will roll out Ox­ford Univer­sity’s Covid-19 vac­cine from Jan 4, ac­cord­ing to plans be­ing drawn up by min­is­ters, The Sun­day Tele­graph re­ported.</p>
    <p>The gov­ern­ment hopes to give the first dose of ei­ther the Ox­ford vac­cine, which has been li­censed to phar­ma­ceu­ti­cal com­pany As­traZeneca, or the Pfizer vac­cine to two mil­lion peo­ple in the next two weeks, the news­pa­per said.</p>
    <p>The Ox­ford vac­cine is eas­ier to store and han­dle than the one from Pfizer, and it is likely to make it eas­ier to reach peo­ple in se­cluded parts of the coun­try. It is ex­pected to be ap­proved by med­i­cal reg­u­la­tors in days, the news­pa­per said.</p>
    <p>Re­spond­ing to the re­port, a Health Depart­ment spokesman said that the Medicines and Health­care Prod­ucts Reg­u­la­tory Agency must be given time to carry out its re­view of the data of the Ox­ford-As­traZeneca Covid-19 vac­cine.</p>
    <p>Bri­tish res­i­dents have started re­ceiv­ing Pfizer’s vac­ci­na­tion, with the gov­ern­ment re­port­ing that over 600,000 peo­ple have re­ceived the vac­cine be­tween Dec 8 and 20.</p>
    <p>Lock­downs in Bri­tain could end by the end of Fe­bru­ary once up to 15 mil­lion vul­ner­a­ble peo­ple have been vac­ci­nated, The Mail re­ported yes­ter­day, cit­ing gov­ern­ment sources. The coun­try’s health ser­vice would no longer be at risk of be­ing over­whelmed by Covid-19 cases once that thresh­old is met, the news­pa­per said.</p>
    <p>Bri­tain recorded 210 Covid-19 deaths last Satur­day, down from 570 the day be­fore, while cases rose 1,968 to 34,693, the gov­ern­ment said, cit­ing par­tial data.</p>
    <p>Bri­tain has recorded a death toll of 70,405, de­fined as those dy­ing within 28 days of a pos­i­tive test.</p>
    <p>A broader mea­sure of those with Covid-19 on their death cer­tifi­cates puts Bri­tain’s death toll at 79,349.</p>
