    <p>A man who has been in and out of jail since 2011 over sex of­fences in­volv­ing mul­ti­ple women is back be­hind bars for sim­i­lar crimes com­mit­ted in 2019 and last year.</p>
    <p>Ap­pear­ing in a district court via video link, Jee Guang You, 33, was sen­tenced on Tues­day to 19 months’ jail af­ter plead­ing guilty to mo­lest­ing an 18-year-old and in­sult­ing a 39-year-old woman’s mod­esty in sep­a­rate in­ci­dents.</p>
    <p>The Sin­ga­porean man was ear­lier sen­tenced to six months’ jail and fined $600 in 2011, af­ter com­mit­ting sim­i­lar of­fences.</p>
    <p>He re­of­fended af­ter his re­lease and was sent to jail twice just two years later – once for in­sult­ing a woman’s mod­esty and an­other time for mo­lesta­tion.</p>
    <p>Jee was later found to be suf­fer­ing from ab­nor­mal sex­ual urges and was sen­tenced to a year’s manda­tory treat­ment or­der (MTO) in 2016 for peep­ing at women in pub­lic re­strooms. This means he had to un­dergo treat­ment to ad­dress his men­tal is­sues in lieu of jail time.</p>
    <p>But the MTO was re­voked when he re­of­fended yet again and was sen­tenced to 19 months’ jail in 2017.</p>
    <p>Jee com­mit­ted sim­i­lar crimes in 2019 and last year, af­ter his last re­lease from prison. He was at a lift lobby of a Church Street build­ing near Raf­fles Place at around noon on June 24, 2019, when he spot­ted the 39-year-old woman.</p>
    <p>Deputy Pub­lic Pros­e­cu­tor (DPP) Huo Jion­grui said that Jee then de­cided to hold his mo­bile phone un­der her skirt “for the thrill of it”.</p>
    <p>The pair took the same lift down be­fore go­ing their sep­a­rate ways.</p>
    <p>Jee was caught af­ter se­cu­rity of­fi­cers viewed closed-cir­cuit tele­vi­sion footage of the area and saw him be­hav­ing in a sus­pi­cious man­ner. The po­lice were alerted the next day.</p>
    <p>Sep­a­rately, he was rid­ing on a train to­wards Jurong East sta­tion at around 9.30am on March 23 last year when he spot­ted the younger woman.</p>
    <p>Jee then sat be­side the teenager who nod­ded off soon af­ter. The court heard that he found the woman at­trac­tive and “felt like he wanted her to be his girl­friend”.</p>
    <p>The DPP said: “He started to lean in closer to her. When his shoul­der touched hers, she did not re­act. The ac­cused got ex­cited and wanted to see how much fur­ther he could go.”</p>
    <p>He mo­lested the woman who woke up af­ter she felt some­body touching her chest. She saw Jee sit­ting be­side her and tried to snap his pic­ture, but he turned away.</p>
    <p>She tried to chase af­ter him when the train pulled up at Jurong East sta­tion, but he man­aged to get away. She lodged a po­lice re­port at around noon that day. Shaf­fiq Alkhatib</p>
