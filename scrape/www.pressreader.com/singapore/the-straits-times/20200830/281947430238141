    <p>Law en­force­ment of­fi­cials said they had shack­led Mr Blake to his hos­pi­tal bed be­cause he faced an ar­rest war­rant from last month on charges of sex­ual as­sault, crim­i­nal tres­pass and dis­or­derly con­duct.</p>
    <p>KENOSHA (Wis­con­sin) • Days af­ter a Kenosha po­lice of­fi­cer shot Mr Ja­cob Blake, a black man, out­side an apart­ment build­ing, the au­thor­i­ties pro­vided new de­tails on what led to the video­taped en­counter that has prompted heated street protests and calls for re­form from pro­fes­sional ath­letes, politi­cians and res­i­dents.</p>
    <p>Law en­force­ment of­fi­cials said in re­cent days that they had shack­led Mr Blake to his hos­pi­tal bed – where he is paral­ysed from the waist down from his wounds – be­cause he faced an ar­rest war­rant from last month on charges of sex­ual as­sault, crim­i­nal tres­pass and dis­or­derly con­duct.</p>
    <p>The same woman who had filed that com­plaint had called 911 be­fore the shoot­ing to re­port Mr Blake’s pres­ence, ac­cord­ing to in­ter­views and records.</p>
    <p>Some on­look­ers and Mr Ben Crump, the civil rights lawyer rep­re­sent­ing Mr Blake, have de­scribed Mr Blake as a peace­maker seek­ing to break up a dis­tur­bance in­volv­ing two women when the po­lice ar­rived.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, Face­book made an “op­er­a­tional mis­take” in not act­ing sooner to re­move a page for a mili­tia group that posted a call to arms in Kenosha, said its chief ex­ec­u­tive Mark Zucker­berg.</p>
    <p>Face­book said on Wednes­day it had re­moved the page for the Kenosha Guard and an event list­ing for Armed Cit­i­zens to Pro­tect Our Lives and Prop­erty, as these vi­o­lated the firm’s pol­icy against “mili­tia or­gan­i­sa­tions”.</p>
    <p>Mr Zucker­berg ac­knowl­edged that the firm had re­ceived complaints from “a bunch of peo­ple” about the post­ing. “The con­trac­tors and re­view­ers who the ini­tial complaints were fun­nelled to ba­si­cally didn’t pick this up.</p>
    <p>“And on se­cond re­view, do­ing it more sen­si­tively, the team that’s re­spon­si­ble for dan­ger­ous or­gan­i­sa­tions recog­nised that this vi­o­lated the poli­cies and we took it down.”</p>
