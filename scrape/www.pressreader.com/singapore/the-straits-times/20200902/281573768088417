    <p>If you thought the pan­demic would be the cat­a­lyst to bring down over­in­flated as­set prices, you might need to think again. There is a good chance that they could get more over­in­flated – thanks to the Fed­eral Re­serve’s shift on in­fla­tion tar­gets, says as­so­ciate ed­i­tor Vikram Khanna (below).</p>
    <p>If you thought the Covid-19 pan­demic would, at some point, be the cat­a­lyst to bring down over­in­flated as­set prices, you might need to think again, be­cause there is a good chance that they could get even more over­in­flated – thanks to the United States Fed­eral Re­serve.</p>
    <p>For decades, cen­tral banks have had a totemic fix­a­tion on con­trol­ling in­fla­tion. That has been the main man­date and fo­cus of mon­e­tary pol­icy al­most ev­ery­where.</p>
    <p>But at the US cen­tral bank’s an­nual (this time, vir­tual) Jack­son Hole sym­po­sium last week,</p>
    <p>Fed chair­man Jerome Pow­ell sig­nalled a sub­tle but sig­nif­i­cant shift in the way the Fed will view its man­date from now on. While it has re­tained its 2 per cent in­fla­tion tar­get, it will try to achieve this over an ex­tended pe­riod.</p>
    <p>In other words, if in­fla­tion falls below 2 per cent for a cer­tain amount of time – say, to 1.5 per cent – the Fed will tol­er­ate in­fla­tion ris­ing to 2.5 per cent for about the same amount of time, so that in­fla­tion av­er­ages out at 2 per cent.</p>
    <p>Up to now, the Fed has not tried to make up for past short­falls in in­fla­tion below 2 per cent. It has sim­ply tried to hit the 2 per cent tar­get go­ing for­ward, ig­nor­ing what hap­pened be­fore. Some econ­o­mists re­fer to this as a “by­gones” strat­egy – the Fed paid no at­ten­tion to the un­der­shoot­ing of in­fla­tion in the past.</p>
    <p>Now it will do so, and will try to make up the short­fall. So it is ba­si­cally a shift from a “by­gones” strat­egy to a “make-up” strat­egy.</p>
    <p>The rea­son for the shift is sim­ple. Since adopt­ing its 2 per cent in­fla­tion tar­get in 2012, the Fed has hardly ever man­aged to achieve it, de­spite strong em­ploy­ment num­bers – at least up un­til the Covid-19 out­break – which should nor­mally lead to higher wage in­fla­tion: US in­fla­tion has av­er­aged just 1.4 per cent over the last eight years, and is cur­rently run­ning at barely 1 per cent.</p>
    <p>NO AM­MU­NI­TION LEFT</p>
    <p>The con­sis­tent short­falls in in­fla­tion have be­come a se­ri­ous prob­lem amid the Covid-19 pan­demic. If in­fla­tion is low, in­ter­est rates also stay low. But then if un­em­ploy­ment rises, the Fed does not have any room to cut rates fur­ther to stim­u­late the econ­omy.</p>
    <p>This is the case right now – US un­em­ploy­ment is ris­ing, but with in­ter­est rates close to zero, the Fed has no am­mu­ni­tion left on the in­ter­est rate front – un­less it de­cides to re­sort to neg­a­tive nom­i­nal in­ter­est rates, like Ja­pan and the euro zone have done, which it is re­luc­tant to do.</p>
    <p>By tol­er­at­ing tem­po­rar­ily higher in­fla­tion, the Fed will re­frain from rais­ing rates as it usu­ally did in the past when in­fla­tion ap­peared on the hori­zon. So for ex­am­ple, if in­fla­tion rises from 1 per cent to 3 per cent, the Fed might still keep the nom­i­nal in­ter­est rate at near zero, which means the real (in­fla­tion-ad­justed) in­ter­est rate would be mi­nus 3 per cent, which would stim­u­late the econ­omy. Higher in­fla­tion would also re­duce the ris­ing debt bur­dens, in real terms, of com­pa­nies and house­holds as well as the govern­ment.</p>
    <p>The Fed will also re­frain from rais­ing in­ter­est rates pre-emp­tively if un­em­ploy­ment goes down sig­nif­i­cantly.</p>
    <p>Up to now it has op­er­ated on the as­sump­tion that if un­em­ploy­ment falls below what is con­sid­ered the “full em­ploy­ment” level – around 3 per cent – in­fla­tion is likely to go up. So the Fed has raised in­ter­est rates in ad­vance, as a pre­cau­tion.</p>
    <p>This is why the Fed raised rates nine times from 2015 to 2018, in the face of a strong job mar­ket – even though in­fla­tion re­mained below 2 per cent.</p>
    <p>Now it will no longer do this.</p>
    <p>Even if the job num­bers are strong, it will not raise in­ter­est rates, un­til 2 per cent in­fla­tion ac­tu­ally ar­rives, and not even then, if past in­fla­tion was lower than 2 per cent.</p>
    <p>The bot­tom line of the Fed’s re­vised pol­icy frame­work is that in­ter­est rates will re­main lower for longer, even af­ter em­ploy­ment picks up and maybe even if in­fla­tion over­shoots 2 per cent. US in­ter­est rates could re­main close to zero for years.</p>
    <p>A BULLISH SIG­NAL</p>
    <p>This has huge im­pli­ca­tions for both fi­nan­cial mar­kets and the econ­omy, as well as mon­e­tary poli­cies elsewhere.</p>
    <p>The prospect of easy money for years on end is a bullish sig­nal for both US stocks and bonds, which could fuel fur­ther spec­u­la­tion.</p>
    <p>One ques­tion though is whether in­vestors would be tempted to bet even more on an al­ready in­flated US stock mar­ket.</p>
    <p>The bench­mark S&P 500 index is trad­ing at a trail­ing price-to-earn­ings ra­tio of around 30, com­pared with a his­tor­i­cal av­er­age of 16.8 since the 1870s. While this does not mean the index can­not go even higher, which has hap­pened be­fore, it is an in­di­ca­tion that val­u­a­tions are stretched on a his­tor­i­cal ba­sis.</p>
    <p>How­ever, the S&P’s cur­rent val­u­a­tion has been in­flated by a hand­ful of tech­nol­ogy stocks – just five of which make up more than 20 per cent of the index’s to­tal cap­i­tal­i­sa­tion.</p>
    <p>It is pos­si­ble that in­vestors might ro­tate into some of the other 495 less-val­ued com­po­nents of the S&P and the US stock mar­ket gen­er­ally, in­clud­ing mid-caps and small caps and/or into mar­kets out­side the US. If they are con­cerned about stock val­u­a­tions – which they might well be, given that in­sol­ven­cies are likely to rise – they could also pile into safe havens such as US Trea­suries and gold.</p>
    <p>With mort­gages likely to re­main cheap for years to come, an­other part of the econ­omy that could take off is US res­i­den­tial real es­tate, the prices of which con­tin­ued to move up in the se­cond quar­ter, de­spite the Covid-19 pan­demic. There are signs that they could go higher still. For in­stance, the price of lum­ber, a key ma­te­rial used in home-build­ing, has more than dou­bled since April.</p>
    <p>The up­shot is that the Fed has set the stage for as­set prices in gen­eral to soar to greater heights, cre­at­ing an even big­ger di­ver­gence be­tween as­set mar­kets and the real econ­omy. As the big­gest ben­e­fi­cia­ries of higher as­set prices are the wealthy, this could lead to a fur­ther widening of in­equal­i­ties in the US – which have al­ready been ex­ac­er­bated by Covid-19, be­cause of ris­ing un­em­ploy­ment com­bined with an as­set price boom.</p>
    <p>RISKS OF RUN­AWAY AS­SET PRICES</p>
    <p>There is a real risk that the as­set price boom could get out of hand. For one thing, the Fed has no man­date to con­trol as­set in­fla­tion.</p>
    <p>There are also le­git­i­mate doubts that the Fed can suc­ceed in its aim to get con­sumer price in­fla­tion to rise. Ja­pan has tried the same thing with ultra-loose mon­e­tary poli­cies for more than 20 years, but has failed. The Euro­pean Cen­tral Bank has also strug­gled to get in­fla­tion up, de­spite main­tain­ing near zero in­ter­est rates since 2013.</p>
    <p>The Fed may stand a bet­ter chance be­cause the US has more favourable de­mo­graph­ics – it has a younger pop­u­la­tion than Ja­pan or the euro zone – which is more con­ducive to higher con­sumer spend­ing. Also, the shift in man­u­fac­tur­ing sup­ply chains away from China and more reshoring of pro­duc­tion could re­sult in higher costs and prices over time.</p>
    <p>But higher in­fla­tion on a sus­tained ba­sis is still far away.</p>
    <p>With the US un­em­ploy­ment rate at more than 10 per cent and climb­ing, and con­sumer con­fi­dence shat­tered, up­ward wage pres­sures are a dis­tant prospect. Higher in­fla­tion may even­tu­ally ar­rive, but at the mo­ment, it is de­fla­tion that is in the as­cen­dant.</p>
    <p>Be­sides, there is only so much the Fed can do. While easy money poli­cies will help, get­ting back to full em­ploy­ment will also de­pend on fis­cal pol­icy.</p>
    <p>As of now, there is no agree­ment among US law­mak­ers, dis­tracted by the up­com­ing pres­i­den­tial elec­tion, to un­leash an­other dose of fis­cal stim­u­lus; most of the past stim­u­lus mea­sures have run their course.</p>
    <p>A less ac­tive fis­cal pol­icy com­bined with the stub­born­ness of low in­fla­tion even in the face of mon­e­tary eas­ing means that the Fed might need to in­ject mas­sive doses of mon­e­tary stim­u­lus to get in­fla­tion to move higher.</p>
    <p>Some econ­o­mists, such as</p>
    <p>No­bel lau­re­ate Paul Krug­man, have even sug­gested that it should raise its in­fla­tion tar­get from 2 per cent to 4 per cent so that it would be able to run easy money poli­cies for even longer.</p>
    <p>An up­ward re­vi­sion of the in­fla­tion tar­get in the fu­ture can­not be ruled out – and then, we should watch out for con­sumer price in­fla­tion to take off.</p>
    <p>But for now, we are on the brink of a surge in as­set price in­fla­tion – not only in the US, but also around the world, be­cause lower-for-longer US in­ter­est rates will mean lower-for-longer rates elsewhere too.</p>
