    <p>SYD­NEY Aus­tralia will likely re­quire in­ter­na­tional ar­rivals to be vac­ci­nated against the coro­n­avirus or face a pro­longed quar­an­tine, as of­fi­cials sketch out what “new nor­mal” virus curbs may look like.</p>
    <p>Al­though no fi­nal de­ci­sion has yet been made on how to pro­ceed when a vac­cine be­comes avail­able, Aus­tralia’s Health Min­is­ter Greg Hunt said yes­ter­day the op­tions could be that all vis­i­tors must first be vac­ci­nated or choose a strict two-week quar­an­tine on ar­rival as the con­di­tions for en­try.</p>
    <p>His com­ments came as Qan­tas Air­ways chief ex­ec­u­tive Alan Joyce said in­ter­na­tional trav­ellers would need to be vac­ci­nated against Covid-19 to fly with the flag car­rier.</p>
    <p>“We are look­ing at chang­ing our terms and con­di­tions to say for in­ter­na­tional trav­ellers that we will ask peo­ple to have a vac­ci­na­tion be­fore they can get on the air­craft,” he told Chan­nel Nine tele­vi­sion.</p>
    <p>“Whether you need that do­mes­ti­cally, we will have to see what hap­pens,” he added.</p>
    <p>Mr Hunt said: “We would ex­pect that peo­ple coming to Aus­tralia while Covid-19 is a sig­nif­i­cant dis­ease in the world will ei­ther be vac­ci­nated or they will iso­late.”</p>
    <p>For eight months, Aus­tralia has been vir­tu­ally closed off from the rest of the world, with a blan­ket ban on non-res­i­dents en­ter­ing the coun­try and cit­i­zens strongly ad­vised against all for­eign travel.</p>
    <p>Do­mes­ti­cally, though, re­stric­tions are eas­ing.</p>
    <p>As coro­n­avirus cases have slowed to a trickle in re­cent weeks, the coun­try will lift more in­ter­nal state bor­der re­stric­tions in a boost for tourism, while the first vac­cines could be avail­able in March, said Mr Hunt.</p>
    <p>Queens­land state, a pop­u­lar hol­i­day des­ti­na­tion, will al­low vis­i­tors next week from the coun­try’s two most pop­u­lous states, New South Wales (NSW) and Vic­to­ria, af­ter clos­ing its bor­ders in Au­gust.</p>
    <p>NSW has since notched a month with­out any Covid-19 cases where the source is un­known and re­stric­tions on ar­rivals from state cap­i­tal Syd­ney will be eased on Dec 1, said Ms An­nasta­cia Palaszczuk, Premier of Queens­land state.</p>
    <p>Res­i­dents of Vic­to­ria, pre­vi­ously the coun­try’s coro­n­avirus hot spot, will also be wel­comed if the state has no new cases today, which would mark 26 days with­out com­mu­nity trans­mis­sion.</p>
    <p>“Queens­land is good to go,” Ms Palaszczuk told re­porters.</p>
    <p>NSW and Vic­to­ria opened their shared bor­der on Mon­day, while the South Aus­tralia-Vic­to­rian bor­der opens fully next week, in wel­come news for Qan­tas and Vir­gin Aus­tralia.</p>
    <p>Qan­tas said it will op­er­ate more than 1,200 re­turn flights from Vic­to­ria and NSW into Queens­land in the run-up to Christ­mas.</p>
    <p>The moves will please Prime Min­is­ter Scott Mor­ri­son who has pushed state lead­ers to re­lax some curbs to help re­vive the econ­omy, which shrank 7 per cent in the three months to end-June, the most since records be­gan in 1959.</p>
    <p>Mr Hunt said Aus­tralia, which has agreed to buy nearly 34 mil­lion doses of As­traZeneca’s Covid-19 vac­cine, is in­creas­ingly con­fi­dent that it can com­plete a vac­ci­na­tion pro­gramme af­ter the re­lease of pre­lim­i­nary trial re­sults.</p>
    <p>“Our vac­cine time­line is be­gin­ning to strengthen. The news from over­seas is that we are on track for first vac­cines in March,” he told re­porters in Syd­ney.</p>
    <p>Aus­tralia has re­ported more than 27,800 cases of Covid-19 and 907 deaths since the pan­demic be­gan, but es­ti­mates there are fewer than 100 ac­tive virus cases re­main­ing, with most of them peo­ple in ho­tel quar­an­tine.</p>
