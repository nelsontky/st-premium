    <p>Shortly af­ter United States Pres­i­dent-elect Joe Bi­den clinched his party’s nom­i­na­tion in May, a group of 50 pro­gres­sive or­gan­i­sa­tions sent his cam­paign a let­ter urg­ing him to com­mit to a broad agenda of for­eign pol­icy re­form. They wanted him to agree to such poli­cies as re-en­ter­ing the Iran nu­clear deal and cut­ting at least US$200 bil­lion (S$268 bil­lion) from the Pen­tagon bud­get.</p>
    <p>Six months later, Mr Bi­den has given his an­swer: With his choice of Mr Antony Blinken for sec­re­tary of state and Mr Jake Sul­li­van as na­tional se­cu­rity ad­viser, as well as his ex­pected nom­i­na­tion of Ms Michele Flournoy for sec­re­tary of de­fence, Mr Bi­den has sig­nalled that his na­tional se­cu­rity Cabi­net will be more cen­trist than the left flank of his party would like.</p>
    <p>To be sure, Mr Blinken, Mr Sul­li­van and Ms Flournoy will not give Saudi Ara­bia the green light it has come to ex­pect from the Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion.</p>
    <p>Mr Bi­den’s ap­point­ment of Mr John Kerry to be his cli­mate czar shows that an is­sue the Trump White House did not care about will be a pri­or­ity for Mr Bi­den.</p>
    <p>And Mr Bi­den has com­mit­ted to try­ing to re­join the 2015 Iran nu­clear deal if Iran comes back into com­pli­ance with it.</p>
    <p>At the same time, all three choices come out of the mod­er­ate wing of the Demo­cratic Party.</p>
    <p>Mr Blinken is a long-time aide to Mr Bi­den go­ing back to his ten­ure as chair­man of the Se­nate For­eign Re­la­tions Com­mit­tee. He has em­pha­sised in the last year how a Bi­den ad­min­is­tra­tion would fo­cus on re­build­ing re­la­tion­ships with al­lies that Trump has dis­rupted.</p>
    <p>He has also sig­nalled that he is more clear-eyed on Mid­dle East</p>
    <p>pol­icy than his party’s pro­gres­sive ac­tivists. Last month, for ex­am­ple, Mr Blinken told the Jewish In­sider that even if the Bi­den ad­min­is­tra­tion sus­pends nu­clear-re­lated sanc­tions on Iran, “we will con­tinue non-nu­clear sanc­tions as a strong hedge against Ira­nian mis­be­haviour in other ar­eas”.</p>
    <p>If Mr Bi­den keeps that prom­ise, then Iran would still be un­der con­sid­er­able fi­nan­cial pres­sure be­cause the Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion has ramped up sanc­tions on Iran for its sup­port of ter­ror­ism.</p>
    <p>In other ar­eas of the world, Mr Bi­den is not quite read­ing from the pro­gres­sive play­book.</p>
    <p>That May let­ter to Mr Bi­den urged him to re­ject ef­forts to work to un­seat the regimes of</p>
    <p>ad­ver­saries and op­pose the “broad based” sanc­tions on Iran and Venezuela. But in a talk last year at the Hud­son In­sti­tute, Mr Sul­li­van wasn’t in com­plete agree­ment. When asked about the Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion’s Venezuela pol­icy, he said a mil­i­tary in­ter­ven­tion was too risky, and that it was wiser to fo­cus on non-mil­i­tary pol­icy.</p>
    <p>“That means dou­bling down on the sanc­tions pieces and con­tin­u­ing to build the in­ter­na­tional coali­tion around this and par­tic­u­larly fo­cus on break­ing off China, Cuba and Rus­sia from Venezuela,” Mr Sul­li­van said.</p>
    <p>Ms Flournoy, too, is a cen­trist on de­fence pol­icy. She has pub­licly op­posed sig­nif­i­cant de­fence cuts and ad­vo­cated for re­build­ing the mil­i­tary to meet new chal­lenges</p>
    <p>from China and Rus­sia. This was a key point of her tes­ti­mony be­fore the House Armed Ser­vices Com­mit­tee last year, when she said her pri­mary con­cern was that a mis­cal­cu­la­tion by Rus­sia or China could lead to a ma­jor con­fronta­tion with the US.</p>
    <p>She ad­vo­cated that the US “pro­cure and de­ploy all of the sys­tems nec­es­sary” to de­ter both coun­tries from any mis­be­haviour.</p>
    <p>Com­pare that with the May 11 let­ter from pro­gres­sives, which called for greater diplo­matic en­gage­ment with Rus­sia and China.</p>
    <p>“Over-hyp­ing the threat these coun­tries pose to the United States in­ten­si­fies fear, racism, and hate do­mes­ti­cally,” it said.</p>
    <p>It’s still very early days to as­sess</p>
    <p>what a Bi­den for­eign pol­icy will look like. When Mr Barack Obama be­came Pres­i­dent, no one was pre­dict­ing the Arab Spring and its tragic af­ter­math in the war in</p>
    <p>Syria.</p>
    <p>Pres­i­dents of­ten learn what their for­eign pol­icy is by re­act­ing to events in the world. Nonethe­less, Mr Bi­den’s early sig­nals show that, for now at least, he is chart­ing a cen­trist course.</p>
    <p>And if his choices for na­tional se­cu­rity po­si­tions are dis­ap­point­ing to his party’s pro­gres­sives, they are sure to be re­as­sur­ing to his coun­try’s al­lies.</p>
