    <p>The goods and ser­vices tax (GST), one of Prime Min­is­ter Naren­dra Modi’s ma­jor re­forms, if not his big­gest, has run into trou­ble on the back of the coronaviru­s pandemic and a con­tract­ing econ­omy.</p>
    <p>The GST, which cut down a web of taxes at the fed­eral and state lev­els, was a mas­sive po­lit­i­cal vic­tory for Mr Modi who, due to his gov­ern­ment’s ma­jor­ity, pulled off a re­form in 2017. Pre­vi­ous govern­ments had tried and failed to do so be­cause of a lack of po­lit­i­cal con­sen­sus.</p>
    <p>Now, the tax, de­pen­dent on co­op­er­a­tion be­tween states and the fed­eral gov­ern­ment, has been hurt by the coronaviru­s pandemic and low GST col­lec­tions, re­sult­ing in a rev­enue short­fall of 2.35 tril­lion ru­pees (S$43.7 bil­lion).</p>
    <p>Fi­nance Min­is­ter Nirmala Sithara­man an­nounced late last month that the fed­eral gov­ern­ment would be un­able to com­pen­sate the states.</p>
    <p>In­stead, she asked the states to bor­row the amount from the Re­serve Bank of In­dia, among other op­tions.</p>
    <p>Com­pen­sat­ing the states was the foun­da­tion on which the GST was ne­go­ti­ated be­cause it got doubt­ing states to agree to a rev­enue-shar­ing model to make up for los­ing state taxes like Value Added Tax.</p>
    <p>The re­sult has been strong op­po­si­tion from at least five op­po­si­tion­ruled states that have ac­cused the fed­eral gov­ern­ment of go­ing against the spirit of fed­er­al­ism and reneg­ing on the com­pen­sa­tion deal.</p>
    <p>The West Ben­gal gov­ern­ment has called the move a “planned strat­egy to crush fed­er­al­ism” while the Delhi gov­ern­ment called it the “big­gest be­trayal” in the his­tory of fed­er­al­ism in In­dia.</p>
    <p>Ker­ala Chief Min­is­ter Pi­narayi Vi­jayan in a let­ter to Mr Modi noted that no com­pen­sa­tion had been re­leased to the states since April 1, when the deal was for the fed­eral gov­ern­ment to trans­fer com­pen­sa­tion every two months.</p>
    <p>“It is felt that trans­fer­ring the obli­ga­tion of GST com­pen­sa­tion to the states through their bor­row­ing is not in ac­cor­dance with the spirit of un­der­stand­ing reached be­tween the Cen­tre & the States,” he wrote in the let­ter.</p>
    <p>Un­der the GST Act, states were guar­an­teed full com­pen­sa­tion for any rev­enue loss in the first five years.</p>
    <p>This com­pen­sa­tion was to come out of a cess on sin and lux­ury prod­ucts, such as liquor and cig­a­rettes.</p>
    <p>In­dia had one of the most strin­gent lock­downs, shut­ting down all eco­nomic ac­tiv­ity when there were a few hun­dred Covid-19 cases in March.</p>
    <p>Since April, the gov­ern­ment has been slowly eas­ing restric­tions to spur eco­nomic growth, which has re­mained slug­gish amid ris­ing coronaviru­s num­bers.</p>
    <p>Lat­est fig­ures show In­dia has over 4.5 mil­lion cases, and the econ­omy con­tracted by 23.9 per cent in the April to June pe­riod.</p>
    <p>Mak­ing up the short­fall would not be easy given the state of the econ­omy, said an­a­lysts.</p>
    <p>“The prob­lem has be­come ag­gra­vated due to a steep fall in col­lec­tion due to Covid-19 and im­pact on the com­pen­sa­tion pool with cess on lux­ury goods com­ing down. Sales of lux­ury cars, for ex­am­ple, have come down,” said Mr Mu­ralid­ha­ran Ra­ma­rat­nam, a se­nior direc­tor spe­cial­is­ing in in­di­rect taxes at Deloitte In­dia.</p>
    <p>The GST coun­cil, which con­trols GST and has fed­eral and state rep­re­sen­ta­tives, is set to meet on Sept 19. In­dian me­dia re­ports said the fed­eral gov­ern­ment is work­ing on so­lu­tions, in­clud­ing pay­ing part of the com­pen­sa­tion.</p>
    <p>There is lit­tle good news on the col­lec­tion front. Au­gust rev­enues slipped around 1 per cent from the pre­vi­ous month to 864.49 bil­lion ru­pees. Many busi­nesses have seen fall­ing or no rev­enues.</p>
    <p>“This is an on­go­ing prob­lem for the (fed­eral gov­ern­ment) as the</p>
    <p>econ­omy is un­likely to re­cover soon given the stag­gered open­ing of the econ­omy, the pandemic mov­ing to ru­ral ar­eas and in­creased num­bers (of cases),” said Mr Rishi Sa­hai, man­ag­ing direc­tor and co­founder of cor­po­rate fi­nance firm Co­gence Ad­vi­sors.</p>
    <p>Some states have sug­gested tax slabs or cess rates be raised to bol­ster rev­enues. This means bring­ing more items to the 28 per cent slab.</p>
    <p>They have also sug­gested that the fed­eral gov­ern­ment bor­row and com­pen­sate the states.</p>
    <p>“Ul­ti­mately the whole thing comes down on us (the tax­pay­ers). But the states are tense; if they put a load on cit­i­zens, it will put a neg­a­tive ef­fect on the vote bank. West Ben­gal is go­ing to the polls soon,” said Kolkata-based econ­o­mist Pro­fes­sor Sarthak Roy­chowd­hury.</p>
