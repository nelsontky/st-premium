    <p>Even as dengue cases fall for the sev­enth con­sec­u­tive week, the Na­tional En­vi­ron­ment Agency is urg­ing peo­ple to re­main vig­i­lant, as it has de­tected a small uptick in the Aedes ae­gypti mosquito pop­u­la­tion in re­cent weeks. The 593 dengue cases re­ported last week con­sti­tuted a 56 per cent drop com­pared with seven weeks ago.</p>
    <p>Even as dengue cases fall for the sev­enth con­sec­u­tive week, the Na­tional En­vi­ron­ment Agency (NEA) is urg­ing peo­ple to re­main vig­i­lant, as it has de­tected a small uptick in the Aedes ae­gypti mosquito pop­u­la­tion in re­cent weeks.</p>
    <p>The 593 dengue cases re­ported last week con­sti­tuted a fall of around 11 per cent from the week be­fore, and a 56 per cent drop com­pared with seven weeks ago.</p>
    <p>But NEA’s sur­veil­lance sys­tem has de­tected a 12 per cent in­crease in mosquito pop­u­la­tion within res­i­den­tial ar­eas in the past three weeks.</p>
    <p>“As the num­ber of dengue cases is still high and the rate of de­cline in weekly cases has slowed down in re­cent weeks, the in­creas­ing Aedes ae­gypti mosquito pop­u­la­tion may lead to an­other surge in dengue cases,” the agency said.</p>
    <p>This is be­cause Sin­ga­pore is still in the midst of the tra­di­tional peak dengue sea­son, which lasts from around May to Oc­to­ber yearly.</p>
    <p>There were 195 ac­tive dengue clus­ters as at Tues­day, 11 fewer than a week be­fore. On the whole, 2,348 of 2,543 dengue clus­ters, or about 92 per cent re­ported this year, have been closed.</p>
    <p>The NEA said a slower rate of dis­ease trans­mis­sion was ob­served in some of the larger dengue clus­ters, such as the 179-case clus­ter in Balam Road, in the MacPher­son area, which had an av­er­age of less than one case re­ported a day in the past two weeks.</p>
    <p>There are, how­ever, still large dengue clus­ters lo­cated in Ar­nasalam Chetty Road, Kim Yam Road, Alju­nied Road, Gey­lang Road, Guille­mard Road, Ang Mo Kio Av­enue 2, East Coast Road, Jalan Baiduri and Be­dok North Av­enue 1.</p>
    <p>To curb dengue trans­mis­sion, the NEA and its part­ners have kept up a high tempo of preven­tive in­spec­tions for mosquito breed­ing, as well as in­spec­tions in clus­ter ar­eas.</p>
    <p>The NEA has also pro­vided town coun­cils and stake­hold­ers with sur­veil­lance data to pri­ori­tise dengue con­trol mea­sures and tar­get ar­eas with higher mosquito pop­u­la­tions.</p>
    <p>Th­ese mea­sures in­clude step­ping up the clean­ing of drains in cer­tain ar­eas and re­mov­ing dis­carded re­cep­ta­cles to pre­vent the ac­cu­mu­la­tion of stag­nant wa­ter.</p>
    <p>This year’s dengue out­break is the largest in seven years, with 30,431 cases re­ported as at Tues­day, sur­pass­ing the pre­vi­ous high of 22,170 re­ported in 2013.</p>
    <p>As at Aug 5, 20 peo­ple aged be­tween 25 and 92 have died of dengue this year.</p>
