    <p>We’re in the midst of a modern-day gold rush.</p>
    <p>The pre­cious me­tal has reached record high prices in re­cent days. A sur­vey of 1,000 peo­ple by Mag­nify Money found that one out of six have in­vested in gold or other pre­cious met­als since May, and about half of Amer­i­cans are se­ri­ously think­ing about buy­ing gold.</p>
    <p>Whether these peo­ple are stock­ing up on gold be­cause they’re wor­ried about a pend­ing apoc­a­lypse or sim­ply con­vinced that it’s a fab­u­lous in­vest­ment, they do have one ma­jor is­sue: stor­age. Bars and coins are bulky (and let’s not get started on jew­ellery, which can be com­pli­cated emo­tion­ally).</p>
    <p>With anx­i­ety about the econ­omy in­creas­ing – which tends to rise any time there’s po­lit­i­cal or world tur­moil – the need for stor­age is grow­ing, too, and op­tions are ex­pand­ing to meet it.</p>
    <p>“Gold and sil­ver bul­lion stor­age op­tions have sim­ply grown more in lo­ca­tion di­ver­sity, pric­ing – with even some of­fer­ing short-term col­lat­eral loan op­tions,” said Mr James Anderson, a re­search ex­ec­u­tive at SD Bul­lion.</p>
    <p>“When I be­gan in this in­dus­try pre-2008 fi­nan­cial cri­sis, there were per­haps 10 to 20 do­mes­tic bul­lion stor­age de­pos­i­to­ries. Now, there are hun­dreds in the USA and abroad.”</p>
    <p>Peo­ple tend to buy gold when they fear a sus­tained loss in stocks, bonds, real es­tate or other tra­di­tion­ally prof­itable in­vest­ments, said Mr Adrian Ash, the di­rec­tor of re­search for Bul­lionVault.</p>
    <p>So pri­vate vault op­er­a­tors have been in­creas­ing their ca­pac­ity as well – but specif­i­cally within pre­sumed po­lit­i­cally safe lo­ca­tions like Switzer­land and Sin­ga­pore, said Mr</p>
    <p>James Turk, the founder and di­rec­tor of Gold­money Inc.</p>
    <p>Switzer­land’s banks have al­ways been deemed a safe haven for as­sets and pre­cious met­als, but, in re­cent years, many peo­ple started to lose faith in banks. As a re­sult, there has been an in­creased de­mand there for safe de­posit boxes there that aren’t run by banks.</p>
    <p>“In late 2019, we even had to build ad­di­tional boxes, as we had reached 100 per cent of our ca­pac­ity,” said Mr Michael Hard­meier, the chief ex­ec­u­tive of Sin­cona Trad­ing, whose head­quar­ters are in a former bank build­ing</p>
    <p>Zurich.</p>
    <p>Swiss vaults tend to be more ex­pen­sive than those in Eng­land, but a new spot opened in Eng­land that was de­signed for those ac­cus­tomed to a lavish life­style. The vault is in­side a former man­sion run by In­ter­na­tional Bank Vaults.</p>
    <p>A chauffeur driv­ing a Rolls-Royce picks up clients and de­liv­ers them to the Lon­don man­sion, where white-gloved cus­to­di­ans trans­fer them to their boxes (after a quick fin­ger­print and iris scan, of course).</p>
    <p>Those boxes are stored within a in cen­tral steel-lined vault sup­pos­edly im­pen­e­tra­ble to any­one at­tempt­ing to il­le­gally gain ac­cess from any an­gle.</p>
    <p>You may have to spend a few of those gold bars to store them: It’s ad­ver­tised as the most ex­pen­sive safe de­posit box in the world, and the firm says it’s avail­able only to bil­lion­aires, with the small­est box start­ing at £600 (S$1,080) to rent (this would fit just a few gold bars).</p>
    <p>Un­like a bank, IBV Lon­don al­lows clients to buy gold and to store it – and IBV will buy back the gold, said Mr Sean Hoey, the man­ag­ing di­rec­tor of IBV Lon­don.</p>
    <p>Also, many gold own­ers be­lieve that vaults, un­like banks, are some­what re­silient to an eco­nomic melt­down. “You can use a safe de­posit box, but folks worry that if there was an eco­nomic melt­down, the banks might close, and your met­als would be trapped in­side that bank,” said Mr Gary Cu­beta, a gold dealer in Ari­zona and the pres­i­dent and founder of In­surance for Fi­nal Ex­pense.</p>
    <p>Even with­out an eco­nomic melt­down, there’s less faith in bank safe de­posit boxes, be­cause there aren’t fed­eral laws gov­ern­ing these boxes, so if any­thing is stolen or de­stroyed, the cus­tomer is typ­i­cally out of luck.</p>
    <p>That may be why some are choos­ing to go the old-fash­ioned route and are stor­ing their gold at home. But it’s wise to con­sider your home op­tions be­fore sim­ply stuff­ing your gold un­der a tree.</p>
    <p>Mr Cu­beta, who ad­vises gold own­ers to store their gold within 15 to 20 min­utes of their home so they have easy ac­cess to it in case of a fi­nan­cial melt­down, said the best thing you can do is to keep half in a home safe while putting the other half in a safe de­posit box.</p>
    <p>“You need a safe es­pe­cially de­signed for pre­cious met­als,” he said, ex­plain­ing that most gun safes can’t with­stand the heat of a fire, while pre­cious me­tal safes will keep your gold pro­tected for two hours.</p>
    <p>Be­fore mov­ing your gold home, you need to con­tact the in­surer that is­sues your home­owner’s policy, be­cause most don’t cover large amounts of gold stored at home.</p>
    <p>There are also stor­age op­tions where you never even see the gold you own.</p>
    <p>Cus­tomers buy a dig­i­tal to­ken backed by phys­i­cal gold held in a vault, said Mr Joonas Karp­pinen, head of trad­ing at In­finiGold.</p>
    <p>“A to­ken pro­vides cus­tomers with ac­tual own­er­ship of the gold in ques­tion – which is essen­tial, es­pe­cially if your con­tent in­surance does not cover your bul­lion port­fo­lio stored in the house,” he said.</p>
    <p>That’s all good, un­less you want to feel its weight in gold. Lit­er­ally.</p>
    <p>Even with­out an eco­nomic melt­down, there’s less faith in bank safe de­posit boxes, be­cause there aren’t fed­eral laws gov­ern­ing these boxes, so if any­thing is stolen or de­stroyed, the cus­tomer is typ­i­cally out of luck.</p>
