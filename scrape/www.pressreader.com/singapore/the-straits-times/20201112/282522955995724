    <p>SHAZAM!</p>
    <p>2019, 126 min­utes, PG</p>
    <p>There is a lot go­ing on in this DC Comics su­per­hero ori­gin story. There is the 13 Go­ing On</p>
    <p>30/Freaky Fri­day body-swop com­edy bit be­cause when Billy (Asher An­gel) be­comes Shazam, the deal comes with an adult male body. The adult ver­sion of Billy is played with in­fec­tious glee by Zachary Levi and he be­haves just as you think a kid would if all his Christ­mases came at once. Not only can Billy throw light­ning bolts from his fin­gers, the world has to now take him se­ri­ously.</p>
    <p>AQUA­MAN (be­low) 2018, 137 min­utes, PG13</p>
    <p>This is the su­per­hero ori­gin story re-imag­ined as a psy­che­delic fairy tale, an ex­cuse to take sci­ence-fic­tion thriller The Abyss (1989), an In­di­ana Jones hunt for buried trea­sure and gi­ant scoops of Lord Of The Rings-style mythol­ogy and stuff ev­ery­thing into a blender.</p>
    <p>If the re­sult sounds like a mess, that is be­cause it is. But ev­ery­thing is just coherent enough to hang to­gether as a story, and the vi­su­als are spec­tac­u­lar. The scale of things here – the bat­tles be­tween un­der­sea king­doms and the species of fan­tas­tic beasts – beats any­thing seen in the more char­ac­ter-driven Won­der Woman (2017).</p>
    <p>ABOM­INABLE 2019, 92 min­utes, PG</p>
    <p>This Amer­i­can-Chi­nese an­i­mated fea­ture, voiced by Chloe Ben­net, Al­bert Tsai, Ten­z­ing Nor­gay Trainor, Sarah Paulson and Ed­die Iz­zard, has enough warmth and magic to ri­val any­thing from Pixar. No seizure-in­duc­ing rapid cuts or rapid-fire pop cul­ture ref­er­ences, just a sat­is­fy­ing, char­ac­ter-driven road movie about plucky kids who run away from home only to dis­cover the true mean­ing of fam­ily.</p>
    <p>THE HARRY POT­TER FRAN­CHISE Eight films, 2001 to 2011, PG</p>
    <p>Hard­core fans would have by now bought the DVD box sets, but there are many who own the sets and still watch the films about the boy wizard ev­ery time they land on cable tele­vi­sion. With all eight films avail­able on video-on-de­mand, a solid week­end of binge-watch­ing is not a bad way to pass the time.</p>
