    <p>Thou­sands of cus­tomers are ex­pe­ri­enc­ing dis­rup­tions to on­line pay­ments as the fall­out aris­ing from trou­bled fi­nan­cial ser­vices provider Wirecard’s exit con­tin­ues.</p>
    <p>Telco M1 has stopped its monthly re­cur­ring pay­ment op­tion, re­quir­ing cus­tomers to in­stead pay their bills through the AXS op­tion in the My M1 app. Like­wise, Safra has sus­pended on­line pay­ment ser­vices due to the ces­sa­tion of Wirecard’s ser­vices in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, Star­bucks cus­tomers are un­able to ac­cess some ser­vices on the cof­fee chain’s app. These in­clude top-up and au­to­matic top-up ser­vices for Star­bucks cards, as well as e-gift card ser­vices.</p>
    <p>Wirecard pulled the plug on its ser­vices last Thurs­day, leav­ing lo­cal busi­nesses scram­bling to switch pay­ment providers.</p>
    <p>Thou­sands of cus­tomers are ex­pe­ri­enc­ing dis­rup­tions to on­line pay­ments as the fall­out aris­ing from trou­bled fi­nan­cial ser­vices provider Wirecard’s exit con­tin­ues.</p>
    <p>Telco M1’s monthly re­cur­ring pay­ment op­tion is tem­po­rar­ily un­avail­able. Cus­tomers should in­stead pay their bills through the AXS op­tion in the My M1 app.</p>
    <p>It told The Straits Times yes­ter­day that it has no­ti­fied cus­tomers through var­i­ous chan­nels such as e-mails, SMS no­ti­fi­ca­tions and up­dates on its web­site, My M1 app and its chat­bot Mindy.</p>
    <p>It added that it is also pro­vid­ing af­fected cus­tomers a flex­i­ble bill pay­ment op­tion, al­though it did not say how many cus­tomers are af­fected or what the flex­i­ble pay­ment op­tion in­volves.</p>
    <p>M1 has more than two mil­lion cus­tomers in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>“Con­cur­rently, we are also work­ing with a lo­cal bank and an al­ter­na­tive pay­ment gate­way ser­vice provider to fa­cil­i­tate all credit card bill pay­ments which have been dis­rupted. This process has been ex­pe­dited and is ex­pected to be ready in two weeks’ time,” said an M1 spokesman.</p>
    <p>The spokesman en­cour­aged cus­tomers to use the range of pay­ment op­tions avail­able to them. Cus­tomers can also call M1’s cus­tomer ser­vice hot­line on 1627 and use its chat­bot Mindy or visit its stores to pur­chase prod­ucts and ser­vices and make pay­ments.</p>
    <p>Pub­lic ser­vant Vic­tor Lim re­ceived an e-mail and SMS no­ti­fi­ca­tion on Tues­day that M1 had stopped its monthly re­cur­ring pay­ment op­tion. “It’s trou­ble­some as we need to re­mem­ber to pay ev­ery month un­til the Giro ar­range­ment can be made. We might for­get to pay if no re­minder is sent to us,” said Mr Lim, who is in his 60s.</p>
    <p>Like­wise, Safra has tem­po­rar­ily sus­pended all on­line pay­ment ser­vices due to the ces­sa­tion of Wirecard’s pay­ment ser­vices in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>“Mem­bers may visit our club­houses for trans­ac­tion mat­ters. Safra is work­ing ex­pe­di­ently to re­in­state the on­line pay­ment and will pro­vide a sta­tus up­date in due course,” said Safra in an e-mail to mem­bers.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, Star­bucks cus­tomers are un­able to ac­cess some ser­vices on the cof­fee chain’s app.</p>
    <p>These in­clude top-up and au­to­matic top-up ser­vices for Star­bucks cards, as well as e-gift card ser­vices. A mes­sage to cus­tomers on the app said that they can visit most Star­bucks stores to pur­chase a phys­i­cal gift card.</p>
    <p>The un­avail­abil­ity of these ser­vices means that cus­tomers will likely need to queue in stores to top up their cards.</p>
    <p>They also need to use these cards if they want to pre-or­der food and drinks on­line for pick-up in stores. They might there­fore now have to or­der and wait for these items at Star­bucks’ out­lets.</p>
    <p>Ms An­drea Lim, 23, said she spent 20 minutes try­ing to top up her card on the Star­bucks app.</p>
    <p>“I was try­ing to or­der a drink to pick up in store while I was on the way there. I didn’t fig­ure out why I couldn’t top up the card, un­til I spent way too long try­ing to key in the OTP (one-time pass­word) and fail­ing,” said Ms Lim, who works in business de­vel­op­ment.</p>
    <p>She added that she had to pay for her drink with Nets in the store.</p>
    <p>Wirecard, which filed for in­sol­vency in June, pulled the plug on its ser­vices last Thurs­day, leav­ing lo­cal busi­nesses scram­bling to switch pay­ment providers.</p>
    <p>The Mon­e­tary Author­ity of Sin­ga­pore had ear­lier di­rected the Ger­man pay­ments firm to stop its pay­ment ser­vices and re­turn all cus­tomers’ funds by Oct 14.</p>
