    <p>As coun­tries locked down their bor­ders and travel fell to near zero, one might as­sume na­tional se­cu­rity would re­quire fewer re­sources, as crowds thinned and peo­ple stayed home. But the se­cu­rity forces of Sin­ga­pore con­tin­ued with key oper­a­tions, de­fend­ing against threats that still re­mained, Covid-19 or not. Fabian Koh speaks to se­cu­rity agen­cies which shared their changes and challenges faced.</p>
    <p>Even amid the coro­n­avirus out­break, the se­cu­rity forces of Sin­ga­pore con­tin­ued with key oper­a­tions to de­fend against per­sis­tent threats.</p>
    <p>They had to adapt to the height­en­ing pan­demic, im­ple­ment­ing safe dis­tanc­ing mea­sures, for in­stance, and ad­just­ing to work­ing re­motely while main­tain­ing key oper­a­tions.</p>
    <p>ON THE ALERT</p>
    <p>One rea­son the ini­tial panic buy­ing sub­sided was that the public re­alised shelves con­tin­ued to be re­stocked de­spite bor­ders be­ing shut, said Rear-Ad­mi­ral Yong Wei Hsi­ung, com­man­der of the navy’s Mar­itime Se­cu­rity Task Force.</p>
    <p>This was pos­si­ble as sea-based sup­ply chains were main­tained, as were oper­a­tions to se­cure crit­i­cal ship­ping lanes. About 80 per cent of Sin­ga­pore’s goods and sup­plies come by sea, he said.</p>
    <p>The threats in­clude piracy as well as mar­itime ter­ror­ism.</p>
    <p>“There was no stop in oper­a­tions, or even a slow­down, be­cause the num­ber of ships that were com­ing in was still around the same, even dur­ing Covid-19,” he said, adding that the navy has at least one of its eight lit­toral mis­sion ves­sels pa­trolling Sin­ga­pore’s wa­ters at all times.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, some par­ties de­cided to take ad­van­tage of the pan­demic to probe the Repub­lic’s air de­fences.</p>
    <p>Bri­gadier-Gen­eral Kelvin Fan, com­man­der of the Air De­fence Task Force, said the Repub­lic of Sin­ga­pore Air Force (RSAF) con­tin­ued to in­ves­ti­gate and re­spond to air threats daily, even when civil avi­a­tion came to a stand­still dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker.</p>
    <p>“Dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker pe­riod, we had to scram­ble our fighter air­craft on a few oc­ca­sions, due to sus­pi­cious air­craft. These are air­craft with no com­mu­ni­ca­tions and air­craft with un­known in­ten­tions,” he said.</p>
    <p>He added that the air force typ­i­cally re­sponds to about 350 sus­pi­cious air­craft yearly, and the pan­demic had no im­pact on that fig­ure last year.</p>
    <p>The police, on the other hand, saw a drop in drug smug­gling in­ci­dents, but were still kept busy with a rise in on­line scams and vice ac­tiv­i­ties driven un­der­ground by Covid-19.</p>
    <p>Police en­force­ment oper­a­tions against il­le­gal gam­bling, vice and other of­fences con­tin­ued, said a police spokesman. “Dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker pe­riod, the police had also stepped up en­gage­ment and ground pa­trol at supermarke­ts to de­ter theft and to en­sure or­der­li­ness among the shopping crowd.”</p>
    <p>Pro­tec­tion of the na­tion’s key in­stal­la­tions, such as Changi Air­port and Jurong Is­land, was main­tained, said Colonel Tan Tiong Keat, com­man­der of the army’s Is­land De­fence Task Force.</p>
    <p>OP­ER­A­TIONAL CHANGES</p>
    <p>While Covid-19 has changed the way many Sin­ga­pore­ans do their jobs, it has ar­guably had an even greater im­pact on se­cu­rity oper­a­tions, re­defin­ing the scope of the se­cu­rity agen­cies’ work and the way they main­tain a keen edge.</p>
    <p>For fighter pi­lots, they had to</p>
    <p>switch to fly­ing lo­cally to main­tain their pro­fi­ciency, since over­seas train­ing was not pos­si­ble.</p>
    <p>This was done with a mix­ture of sim­u­la­tor flights, but also in­volved real flights, which brought com­plaints from some res­i­dents here due to the noise.</p>
    <p>BG Fan said the air force re­sponded by tweak­ing its flight sched­ule dur­ing ex­am­i­na­tion pe­ri­ods, and de­sign­ing flight paths such that most of them were over wa­ter.</p>
    <p>As the coun­try ramped up safe dis­tanc­ing mea­sures, police of­fi­cers had to deal with peo­ple abu­sive to­wards SG Clean and safe dis­tanc­ing am­bas­sadors as well as en­force­ment of­fi­cers.</p>
    <p>Over 3,000 police of­fi­cers were also de­ployed be­yond their tra­di­tional roles, do­ing con­tact trac­ing, se­cur­ing govern­ment quar­an­tine fa­cil­i­ties and as­sist­ing at dor­mi­to­ries that were iso­la­tion or quar­an­tine fa­cil­i­ties.</p>
    <p>The Im­mi­gra­tion and Check­points Au­thor­ity (ICA) also moved be­yond its usual roles of bor­der se­cu­rity and im­mi­gra­tion con­trol to man­age the stay-home no­tice pro­gramme, start­ing on Feb 18 last year.</p>
    <p>At the scheme’s peak in April, there were over 40,000 peo­ple serv­ing stay-home no­tices at the same time, and ICA was mak­ing 8,000 calls and 1,000 house vis­its daily, said Deputy As­sis­tant Com­mis­sioner Tan Hoe Koon, deputy di­rec­tor of the ICA’s in­tel­li­gence divi­sion.</p>
    <p>“This stay-home no­tice regime is a to­tally brand new job scope for ICA. ICA has no ex­pe­ri­ence in run­ning these regime ef­forts, so over time we just adopted and adapted to keep up,” said DAC Tan.</p>
    <p>EX­TRA-SAFE MEA­SURES</p>
    <p>Col Tan said the de­fence forces gen­er­ally adopt an even more strin­gent pos­ture com­pared with the na­tional Covid-19 mea­sures.</p>
    <p>For ex­am­ple, af­ter eased rules al­lowed up to 50 peo­ple at cer­tain events, the mil­i­tary avoided phys­i­cal events where pos­si­ble, and also kept to vir­tual meet­ings.</p>
    <p>A key chal­lenge for the army at the height of the pan­demic was com­mu­ni­cat­ing pol­icy – which changed based on a very fluid virus sit­u­a­tion – quickly across its ranks, since it is the ser­vice with the largest head­count.</p>
    <p>Across the forces, ad­di­tional pre­cau­tion­ary gear be­came the norm, with of­fi­cers wear­ing face masks and reg­u­larly wip­ing down all spa­ces and equip­ment used.</p>
    <p>Even dur­ing search-and-res­cue oper­a­tions and med­i­cal evac­u­a­tions out at sea, air force he­li­copter crews have to wear per­sonal pro­tec­tive equip­ment, said BG Fan.</p>
    <p>“So you can imag­ine, with masks and gowns, it makes the job more dif­fi­cult, es­pe­cially in a con­fined space like a he­li­copter.”</p>
    <p>RSAF con­ducted 15 such mis­sions last year.</p>
    <p>Be­sides phys­i­cal safety, the men­tal well­ness of per­son­nel had to be taken care of.</p>
    <p>Soldiers had to be away from their fam­i­lies for a longer time to en­sure they were Covid-19-free, but poli­cies were changed so they could stay in touch reg­u­larly, said Col Tan.</p>
    <p>Start­ing from the cir­cuit breaker</p>
    <p>pe­riod, a new ro­ta­tion cy­cle saw per­son­nel con­fined in camp for two weeks, be­fore as­sum­ing oper­a­tions for two weeks. Dur­ing this time, soldiers were al­lowed to make video calls in spe­cially des­ig­nated zones.</p>
    <p>“It was a spe­cial pro­vi­sion that we made be­cause of Covid-19,” said Col Tan. Typ­i­cally, cam­era phones are al­lowed into camps, but with the cam­era func­tion dis­abled.</p>
    <p>The navy had li­ai­son teams to tend to the needs of fam­i­lies of navy per­son­nel stay­ing in-base, while Sin­ga­pore Police Force para­coun­sel­lors and psy­chol­o­gists were on standby to sup­port any police of­fi­cers who were psy­cho­log­i­cally af­fected.</p>
    <p>DIG­I­TAL ADOP­TION</p>
    <p>It has by now be­come a cliche to say Covid-19 has ac­cel­er­ated dig­i­tal adop­tion, but this is no less true for se­cu­rity agen­cies here, which have had to adapt and over­come tra­di­tional con­cerns such as in­for­ma­tion se­cu­rity.</p>
    <p>Ma­jor Saran­jit Singh Dhillon, com­mand­ing of­fi­cer of the 1st Sig­nal Bat­tal­ion which over­sees the Sin­ga­pore Armed Forces (SAF) C4 Com­mand – com­mand, con­trol, com­mu­ni­ca­tions and com­put­ers – and cy­ber-de­fence oper­a­tions, was in­te­gral in ramp­ing up the or­gan­i­sa­tion’s net­work band­width for com­mu­ni­ca­tions.</p>
    <p>With a ma­jor shift to­wards tele­con­fer­enc­ing, the SAF needed to en­sure it ex­panded its ca­pac­ity to sus­tain its oper­a­tions.</p>
    <p>Apart from bud­get and cy­ber-se­cu­rity con­cerns, Maj Saran­jit said that with Covid-19, it was a race against the clock to get the nec­es­sary re­quire­ments in place.</p>
    <p>The navy, too, had to move heav­ily into tele­con­fer­enc­ing, RearAdm Yong said, es­pe­cially since most mar­itime se­cu­rity is­sues are transna­tional and re­quire work­ing with for­eign coun­ter­parts. Prior to Covid-19, of­fi­cers from dif­fer­ent coun­tries typ­i­cally trav­elled around for in-per­son meet­ings.</p>
    <p>BG Fan said that the air force has been pushed to be­come more cre­ative in or­gan­is­ing events, since many of its units cel­e­brated key an­niver­saries last year. For ex­am­ple, it adopted gam­i­fied ex­pe­ri­ences like fit­ness challenges that its per­son­nel could take on to­gether re­motely.</p>
    <p>The police spokesman said the force shifted com­mu­nity out­reach and en­gage­ment ef­forts on­line, to com­ple­ment phys­i­cal ac­tiv­i­ties al­lowed un­der ex­ist­ing rules.</p>
    <p>“In the neigh­bour­hood do­main, the police con­duct vir­tual house vis­its with the res­i­dents in their precinct,” he said.</p>
    <p>The police also de­ployed tech­nol­ogy, such as self-op­er­at­ing drones to pa­trol in­dus­trial es­tates and au­ton­o­mous ro­bots in the dor­mi­tory oper­a­tions.</p>
    <p>Over 3,000 police of­fi­cers were also de­ployed be­yond their tra­di­tional roles, do­ing con­tact trac­ing, se­cur­ing govern­ment quar­an­tine fa­cil­i­ties and as­sist­ing at dor­mi­to­ries that were iso­la­tion or quar­an­tine fa­cil­i­ties.</p>
    <p>Start­ing from the cir­cuit breaker pe­riod, a new ro­ta­tion cy­cle saw per­son­nel con­fined in camp for two weeks, be­fore as­sum­ing oper­a­tions for two weeks. Dur­ing this time, soldiers were al­lowed to make video calls in spe­cially des­ig­nated zones... Typ­i­cally, cam­era phones are al­lowed into camps, but with the cam­era func­tion dis­abled.</p>

For ex­am­ple, it adopted gam­i­fied ex­pe­ri­ences like fit­ness challenges that its per­son­nel could take on to­gether re­motely.</p>
    <p>EX­TRAOR­DI­NARY TIMES</p>
    <p>The Covid-19 pan­demic has cer­tainly been a for­mi­da­ble test of the dif­fer­ent se­cu­rity agen­cies’ abil­ity to re­assess, re­group and re­de­ploy in the face of what is hope­fully a once-in-a-gen­er­a­tion threat.</p>
    <p>Pro­fes­sor of se­cu­rity stud­ies Ro­han Gu­naratna of the S. Ra­jarat­nam School of In­ter­na­tional Stud­ies said that for a small city state like Sin­ga­pore, the “dis­tinc­tion of</p>
    <p>in­ter­nal and ex­ter­nal se­cu­rity has faded away” dur­ing the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>He said the Home Team and the SAF have worked to­gether “bril­liantly” against the back­drop of strin­gent mea­sures, to mit­i­gate the fa­tigue of front-line per­son­nel.</p>
    <p>“The global pan­demic is un­prece­dented. Oper­a­tions need not be nor­mal in ex­traor­di­nary times.”</p>
    <p>Of­fi­cers work­ing in the Repub­lic of Sin­ga­pore Air Force (RSAF) con­trol cen­tres have been op­er­at­ing from mul­ti­ple venues con­cur­rently, ow­ing to safe man­age­ment mea­sures.</p>
    <p>The to­tal num­ber of of­fi­cers work­ing each of the two 12-hour shifts re­mains the same, but they are spread out over dif­fer­ent venues and con­tinue to per­form key func­tions, in­clud­ing mon­i­tor­ing Sin­ga­pore’s airspace and di­rect­ing RSAF air­craft in the skies.</p>
    <p>It has not been with­out challenges.</p>
    <p>Of­fi­cers are un­able to share screens since they are not in the same room, and have to com­mu­ni­cate through au­dio calls.</p>
    <p>Lieu­tenant Dor­cas Ng, an air war­fare of­fi­cer, said that when hand­ing over du­ties af­ter a shift, they also have to re­late im­por­tant in­for­ma­tion to the next per­son with­out hav­ing phys­i­cal screens to re­fer to.</p>
    <p>The 25-year-old said they con­tinue to com­mu­ni­cate re­motely when re­spond­ing to ur­gent in­ci­dents, such as the ap­pear­ance of a sus­pi­cious air­craft. In such sce­nar­ios, there is a need for quick and ac­cu­rate in­for­ma­tion.</p>
    <p>“We have to wear masks at all times, even dur­ing con­trol­ling, so some­times it can be quite a chal­lenge as our voices are more muf­fled,” added Lt Ng.</p>
    <p>“So we need to speak louder, and clearly.”</p>
