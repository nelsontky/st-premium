    <p>The People’s Ac­tion Party (PAP) Women’s Wing and As­so­ci­a­tion of Women for Ac­tion and Re­search (Aware) have said they are dismayed at the sen­tence that the Na­tional Univer­sity of Singapore (NUS) stu­dent re­ceived for try­ing to stran­gle his former girl­friend.</p>
    <p>The PAP Women’s Wing has shared its concerns about the sen­tenc­ing with the Min­is­ter for Home Af­fairs, “who has com­mit­ted to look fur­ther into the mat­ter”.</p>
    <p>“The PAP Women’s Wing and PAP Women Mem­bers of Par­lia­ment strongly de­nounce vi­o­lence against women. Like many mem­bers of the pub­lic, we are dismayed that the sen­tence in this case ap­pears dis­pro­por­tion­ate to the offence,” the PAP Women’s Wing said in a state­ment yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Man­power Min­is­ter Josephine Teo, who is chair­man of the Women’s Wing and Sec­ond Min­is­ter for Home Af­fairs, car­ried the state­ment on her Face­book page and, in all cap­i­tal let­ters, announced that the mat­ter was “an is­sue of se­ri­ous con­cern”.</p>
    <p>Den­tistry stu­dent Yin Zi Qin was given a short de­ten­tion or­der of 12 days and a day re­port­ing or­der of five months, whereby of­fend­ers have to re­port to a cen­tre for mon­i­tor­ing and coun­selling as well as un­dergo re­ha­bil­i­ta­tion.</p>
    <p>The 23-year-old was also or­dered to com­plete 80 hours of com­mu­nity ser­vice over a year.</p>
    <p>Also weigh­ing in on the case yes­ter­day was Aware, which said it was sur­prised and dis­con­certed over the sen­tence. “Such a sen­tence has a detri­men­tal im­pact on pub­lic per­cep­tions of vi­o­lence against women: in­di­cat­ing to per­pe­tra­tors that they</p>
    <p>EVOLV­ING NORMS</p>
    <p>It boils down to whether or not out­comes in these cases have been able to keep up with evolv­ing norms and ex­pec­ta­tions in so­ci­ety... It’s a very pos­i­tive sign for so­ci­ety that our youths are so ready to be a part of this process and that they care deeply about (these) is­sues. can get away with a light pun­ish­ment, and in­di­cat­ing to sur­vivors that the of­ten ar­du­ous process of re­port­ing their ex­pe­ri­ence will be un­re­ward­ing or even fu­tile,” it said, adding that the sen­tence shows an im­bal­ance.</p>
    <p>It said the harm ex­pe­ri­enced by the fe­male sur­vivor is fre­quently min­imised, while the past record and future po­ten­tial of the male per­pe­tra­tor is am­pli­fied.</p>
    <p>Two pe­ti­tions have also been cir­cu­lat­ing on­line, with one call­ing for a harsher sen­tence for the stu­dent, and an­other de­mand­ing NUS ex­pel the stu­dent. The first one has gar­nered more than 14,500 sig­na­tures as of yes­ter­day and the other pe­ti­tion has over 16,500 sig­na­tures.</p>
    <p>Se­nior Min­is­ter of State for Cul­ture, Com­mu­nity and Youth Sim Ann en­cour­aged young people who have raised concerns to join dis­cus­sions that will be or­gan­ised by the min­istry and the Na­tional Youth Coun­cil.</p>
