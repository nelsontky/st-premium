    <p>A TIME OF SUF­FER­ING</p>
    <p>Those three months still make me cry. It was a real strug­gle and I suf­fered a lot.</p>
    <p>MS SANJIDA AKHTER, Mr Raju Sarker’s wife, on the pe­riod when her hus­band was very ill.</p>
    <p>A Bangladesh­i worker in Sin­ga­pore who made a dra­matic re­cov­ery af­ter a five-month bat­tle with Covid-19 is hop­ing to go home early next year to see his eight­month-old son.</p>
    <p>Mr Raju Sarker, who was Case 42, has yet to hold Sa­fun, who was born in March when his fa­ther was in in­ten­sive care and close to death.</p>
    <p>Mr Sarker has not been home to Joy­debpur in Bangladesh’s Gazipur district since June last year. About a month ago, when Sa­fun ut­tered “baba” (the Ben­gali term for fa­ther) for the first time on the phone, he wept.</p>
    <p>“I draw strength from him. The kid has grown up so much, I have to get him mar­ried now,” he added in jest.</p>
    <p>Mr Sarker, 40, tested pos­i­tive for the coro­n­avirus in Fe­bru­ary and spent nearly five months in Tan Tock Seng Hos­pi­tal, half that time in an in­ten­sive care unit. He was dis­charged in June.</p>
    <p>While the coro­n­avirus left him with other health con­cerns, such as fall­ing blood platelet lev­els and poor heart func­tion, Mr Sarker said he feels much bet­ter now and is no longer on med­i­ca­tion.</p>
    <p>He hopes to get the all-clear from his doc­tors later this month to re­turn to Bangladesh to see his fam­ily ei­ther in Fe­bru­ary or March. “If not, I will have to stay longer in Sin­ga­pore,” he said.</p>
    <p>The signs are good though. Cur­rently at 59kg, he has re­cov­ered much of the weight that he lost when he fell sick. From 64kg, it plum­meted to 40kg.</p>
    <p>His doc­tors at the time said they were sur­prised at his re­cov­ery. His oxy­gen lev­els had dropped so low they thought he might not make it.</p>
    <p>His longer-term ca­reer plan is still un­cer­tain. Mr Sarker, who worked for an IT so­lu­tions firm as a safety co­or­di­na­tor at project sites, hopes his em­ployer will of­fer him a less stren­u­ous ad­min­is­tra­tive role.</p>
    <p>“My phys­i­cal ca­pac­ity is not the same... Ear­lier, I did not think about my con­di­tion. I would go any­where for what­ever job when­ever I was asked. I didn’t even bother if I had eaten or not. But now I have to be care­ful,” he said.</p>
    <p>If this does not ma­te­ri­alise, he may re­turn to Bangladesh for good.</p>
    <p>While his fa­ther-in-law has of­fered to let him work at his gro­cery store, Mr Sarker hopes the Bangladesh­i gov­ern­ment will as­sist him through ei­ther a one-time grant or a gov­ern­ment job that will al­low him to sup­port his fam­ily.</p>
    <p>Cur­rently lodged at an ac­com­mo­da­tion pro­vided by his em­ployer, he spends his time chat­ting with his fam­ily on the phone or ex­plor­ing spir­i­tual Is­lamic con­tent on his lap­top.</p>
    <p>His near-death ex­pe­ri­ence, he said, has made him more re­li­gious. “Know­ing that Al­lah saved me, I am try­ing to walk on the right path,” he said.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, in Bangladesh, his wife, Sanjida Akhter, 18, awaits his re­turn. “Such an un­for­tu­nate in­ci­dent hap­pened abroad. I don’t feel like let­ting him live abroad now,” she said on the phone from Gazipur district.</p>
    <p>The con­ver­sa­tion was punc­tu­ated by the re­peated moo­ing of a calf at her par­ents’ house in Kalni, which is where she is liv­ing with her son. Even now, when­ever she thinks of the time when her hus­band was ill, she said, her eyes well up in tears.</p>
    <p>“Those three months still make me cry. It was a real strug­gle and I suf­fered a lot,” she said, ad­ding that she would like her hus­band to re­turn to Bangladesh and re­build his ca­reer there.</p>
