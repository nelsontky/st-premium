    <p>Ap­ple Or­chard Road is among the new places vis­ited by Covid-19 pa­tients while they were still in­fec­tious, the Min­istry of Health (MOH) said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Tekka Cen­tre and Bugis+ are also new ad­di­tions to the list of places vis­ited by in­fec­tious pa­tients.</p>
    <p>Other places added are Tat Fong Paint at 492 Gey­lang Road, bet­ting agency Cheng Chew Wah at 20 Frankel Ter­race and All In­dia Su­per­mart at 41 Nor­ris Road.</p>
    <p>The min­istry pro­vides a list of lo­ca­tions and times that in­fec­tious Covid-19 pa­tients have vis­ited for at least 30 min­utes, to get those who were at these places dur­ing those spe­cific pe­ri­ods to mon­i­tor their health closely for two weeks from the date of their visit.</p>
    <p>The full list of lo­ca­tions and times can be found on MOH’s web­site.</p>
    <p>MOH has said that close con­tacts would al­ready have been no­ti­fied and there is no need to avoid these places as they would have been cleaned if needed.</p>
    <p>MOH also an­nounced 249 new cases yes­ter­day, in­clud­ing 15 new com­mu­nity cases – three work pass hold­ers and 12 work per­mit hold­ers. Al­though 16 cases in the com­mu­nity were re­ported yes­ter­day af­ter­noon, MOH said one case had been re­clas­si­fied fol­low­ing con­tact trac­ing.</p>
    <p>Five of the com­mu­nity cases were linked to pre­vi­ous cases or clus­ters. Of these, three cases had been iden­ti­fied as con­tacts of pre­vi­ously con­firmed cases, and had been tested dur­ing their quar­an­tine to de­ter­mine their sta­tus, even though they were asymp­to­matic.</p>
    <p>The other two linked cases were also asymp­to­matic and were tested as part of pe­ri­odic screen­ing of work­ers in the con­struc­tion sec­tor.</p>
    <p>The re­main­ing 10 com­mu­nity cases were un­linked as of yes­ter­day. Of these, nine cases had been de­tected as a re­sult of screen­ing of work­ers in es­sen­tial ser­vices who are liv­ing out­side dor­mi­to­ries.</p>
    <p>Epi­demi­o­log­i­cal in­ves­ti­ga­tions are be­ing done for the re­main­ing un­linked case, who was swabbed un­der en­hanced com­mu­nity test­ing to test all in­di­vid­u­als aged 13 and above who are di­ag­nosed with acute res­pi­ra­tory in­fec­tion when they first visit a doc­tor.</p>
    <p>There were also five new im­ported cases. One is a Sin­ga­porean who re­turned from In­dia on July 3. Another two cases are a work pass holder and a stu­dent pass holder.</p>
    <p>The fourth case, who re­turned from In­dia, is a long-term visit pass holder whose spouse is a per­ma­nent res­i­dent.</p>
    <p>All of them had been placed on 14-day stay-home no­tices upon ar­rival in Sin­ga­pore, and had been tested while serv­ing their no­tices.</p>
    <p>For the last im­ported case, ded­i­cated trans­port ar­range­ments were made to take the 30-year-old Bri­tish man from Changi Air­port to a ves­sel at Jurong Port upon ar­rival from the United States, where he had re­mained un­til he was placed in a gov­ern­ment quar­an­tine fa­cil­ity in Sin­ga­pore. The man is on a short­term pass visit and was con­firmed to be pos­i­tive on Tues­day.</p>
    <p>Mi­grant work­ers in dor­mi­to­ries made up the re­main­ing 229 cases, tak­ing Sin­ga­pore’s to­tal to 46,878.</p>
    <p>A dor­mi­tory at 11 Tuas Av­enue 10 was also cleared, and now houses only re­cov­ered in­di­vid­u­als and those who have re­cently tested neg­a­tive. As a re­sult, the clus­ter has now been closed, said MOH.</p>
    <p>The av­er­age num­ber of new daily cases in the com­mu­nity in a week has de­creased from 14 cases two weeks ago to 13 in the past week.</p>
    <p>How­ever, the num­ber of un­linked cases in the com­mu­nity in a week has in­creased from the daily av­er­age of six cases to eight over the same pe­riod.</p>
    <p>There were no pa­tients in in­ten­sive care for the sec­ond day in a row yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Be­fore Tues­day, the l ast time there were no pa­tients in in­ten­sive care was on Feb 5, af­ter which more peo­ple were ad­mit­ted.</p>
    <p>The num­ber of pa­tients in in­ten­sive care peaked at 32 on April 10, be­fore com­ing down to one on July 7.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore has had 27 deaths from Covid-19 com­pli­ca­tions, while 14 who tested pos­i­tive have died of other causes.</p>
