    <p>It is likely a mat­ter of time be­fore Ma­rina Bay Sands (MBS) will have to let go of some of its staff due to the fall­out from the Covid-19 pan­demic, said an­a­lysts, fol­low­ing a re­trench­ment ex­er­cise by fel­low in­te­grated re­sort op­er­a­tor Re­sorts World Sen­tosa (RWS).</p>
    <p>This is be­cause the do­mes­tic mar­ket alone is un­sus­tain­able, and there is no clear time­line as to when tourism can restart.</p>
    <p>MBS’ $4.5 bil­lion ex­pan­sion project could also be de­layed or scaled down, the an­a­lysts told The Straits Times.</p>
    <p>RWS had on Wed­nes­day an­nounced the re­trench­ment of its staff, al­though it de­clined to dis­close the num­ber of work­ers af­fected. ST un­der­stands that about 2,000 em­ploy­ees were laid off.</p>
    <p>RWS had more than 7,000 em­ploy­ees as at the end of last year.</p>
    <p>MBS has more than 10,000 em­ploy­ees. It de­clined to re­spond to ques­tions on its man­power plans, and said there was no up­date to its ex­pan­sion plan.</p>
    <p>Nanyang Busi­ness School ad­junct as­so­ciate pro­fes­sor Za­far Momin said RWS and MBS were fac­ing the same is­sues, such as re­duced de­mand from vis­i­tors due to fear of virus ex­po­sure and in­ter­na­tional travel re­stric­tions.</p>
    <p>Prof Za­far said: “De­pend­ing on its fi­nan­cial ca­pac­ity and risk ap­petite for man­ag­ing the fi­nan­cial im­pact of the pan­demic, MBS is likely to carry out sim­i­lar mea­sures to a higher or lower degree of sever­ity.”</p>
    <p>He said the re­trench­ment of staff in­di­cates that com­pa­nies do not ex­pect fu­ture de­mand to meet pre­vi­ous lev­els for some time.</p>
    <p>May­bank Kim Eng an­a­lyst Yin Shao Yang noted that RWS owner Gent­ing Sin­ga­pore has net cash on its bal­ance sheet. In con­trast, MBS has a net debt of US$2.4 bil­lion ($3.34 bil­lion) as at March 31.</p>
    <p>“MBS (and RWS) are sub­ject to a small lo­cal gam­blers mar­ket and re­liant on in­ter­na­tional gam­blers, but bor­ders are closed,” he said.</p>
    <p>CIMB Pri­vate Bank­ing econ­o­mist Song Seng Wun noted that the Jobs Sup­port Scheme, which cov­ers up to 75 per cent of wages for lo­cal work­ers, will help them re­tain staff, but there is still an is­sue of an over­sup­ply of labour.</p>
    <p>“The only question is whether the man­age­ment at the MBS side is more op­ti­mistic about bor­ders be­ing re­opened than RWS,” he said.</p>
    <p>When asked about the pos­si­ble im­pact of Covid-19 on MBS’ ex­pan­sion plan, Mr Song said it could lead to de­lays by a cou­ple of years, de­pend­ing on fac­tors such as when a vac­cine is found.</p>
    <p>Las Ve­gas Sands, owner of MBS, an­nounced in April last year its ex­pan­sion plan, which in­cluded a lux­ury ho­tel tower and a 15,000-seat en­ter­tain­ment arena.</p>
    <p>Lawyer Yap Wai Ming, who sits on the editorial board of the Gam­ing Law Re­view And Eco­nom­ics jour­nal, sug­gested the plan could be down­sized, given that long-term con­sumer be­hav­iour would likely be af­fected by Covid-19. He also noted that Las Ve­gas Sands is now show­ing a much more con­ser­va­tive stance, as re­flected in its de­ci­sion in May to pull out of the race to run an in­te­grated re­sort in Ja­pan.</p>
    <p>“I think the world is press­ing a re­set but­ton on ev­ery­thing in 2020. The one that will be af­fected will be mass events, where you have a lot of peo­ple gath­er­ing,” he said.</p>
    <p>“In Ma­cau, so many casi­nos had closed for sev­eral months. But even as they start to open now, it’s not as if peo­ple are go­ing there in droves.”</p>
    <p>Both he and Prof Za­far also noted that a shift to­wards on­line gam­bling could af­fect the busi­nesses of RWS and MBS in the long term.</p>
    <p>Las Ve­gas Sands, which trades on the New York Stock Ex­change, opened about 1.2 per cent lower yes­ter­day.</p>
