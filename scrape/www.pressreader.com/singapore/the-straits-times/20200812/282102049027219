    <p>AXA is con­sid­er­ing a sale of its Sin­ga­pore business as it seeks to raise funds di­vest­ing pe­riph­eral op­er­a­tions, ac­cord­ing to peo­ple fa­mil­iar with the mat­ter.</p>
    <p>The French in­surer is work­ing with an ad­viser on the po­ten­tial sale, the sources said, ask­ing not to be iden­ti­fied be­cause it is a pri­vate mat­ter.</p>
    <p>The Sin­ga­pore unit, which of­fers life and prop­erty and ca­su­alty in­sur­ance, could draw in­ter­est from ri­vals seek­ing to ex­pand in South-east Asia, the sources said. It gen­er­ated €615 mil­lion (S$994 mil­lion) of rev­enue last year, ac­cord­ing to AXA’s an­nual re­port.</p>
    <p>A sale process could start as soon as the next few weeks, the sources said. No fi­nal de­ci­sions have been made and there is no cer­tainty that the de­lib­er­a­tions will lead to a trans­ac­tion, they added. A rep­re­sen­ta­tive for Paris-based AXA de­clined to com­ment.</p>
    <p>AXA and a lo­cal part­ner are also con­sid­er­ing a po­ten­tial sale of their life and gen­eral in­sur­ance ven­ture in Malaysia, which could fetch about US$650 mil­lion (S$891 mil­lion), Bloomberg News re­ported last year.</p>
    <p>AXA said this month that an agree­ment it struck to sell its AXA Life Europe business to Cin­ven had been ter­mi­nated af­ter cer­tain con­di­tions were not met.</p>
    <p>Chief ex­ec­u­tive Thomas Bu­berl is try­ing to shift AXA’s fo­cus on prop­erty and ca­su­alty in­sur­ance fol­low­ing its US$15.3 bil­lion pur­chase of XL Group in 2018.</p>
    <p>Since then, Mr Bu­berl has been re­view­ing op­tions for smaller busi­nesses across the world, in­clud­ing in the Mid­dle East, to help pay for the XL deal.</p>
    <p>Profit at AXA sank in the first half as it booked a €1.5 bil­lion charge for claims re­lated to Covid-19. AXA warned of fur­ther shocks from the coro­n­avirus pan­demic, scrapped growth tar­gets and can­celled a pay­out to share­hold­ers.</p>
    <p>Deal mak­ing in the in­sur­ance in­dus­try has re­mained re­silient amid a slow­down in broader merg­ers and ac­qui­si­tions ac­tiv­ity amid the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>In­sur­ers have been in­volved in US$99 bil­lion of ac­qui­si­tions this year, up 77 per cent from the same pe­riod last year, ac­cord­ing to data com­piled by Bloomberg.</p>
