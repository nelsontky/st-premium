    <p>• For Hong Kong singer G.E.M., who is cur­rently based in China, home is so near yet so far, as a re­sult of the Covid-19 pan­demic.</p>
    <p>The Shang­hai na­tive, whose real name is Glo­ria Tang, wrote on so­cial me­dia on Tues­day: “Today is the sev­enth month I am away from home. I have so many things in the ho­tel room that there is al­most no space to put them.</p>
    <p>“My mum has come to Shang­hai to visit me even though she has to be quar­an­tined for 14 days each on both sides, but I have not met my dad and younger sis­ter for a long time.”</p>
    <p>Hong Kong tele­vi­sion host Joyce Ngai com­mented that she missed</p>
    <p>Tang too, while Malaysian singer Gin Lee en­cour­aged Tang to keep go­ing and added that she has a good mother.</p>
    <p>Tang, 29, who is known for her im­pres­sive vo­cal range and pi­ano skills, is dat­ing Ngai’s brother, stylist Mark Ngai.</p>
    <p>Tang re­ceived sev­eral nom­i­na­tions, in­clud­ing Al­bum of the Year and Best Fe­male Vo­cal­ist (Man­darin), for her stu­dio al­bum City Zoo at Tai­wan’s Golden Melody Awards in Oc­to­ber, win­ning the Spe­cial Award from the jury.</p>
    <p>She was also named one of the Best Asian Artists at the Mnet Asian Mu­sic Awards in South Korea on Dec 6.</p>
