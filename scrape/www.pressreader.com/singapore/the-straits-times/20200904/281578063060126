    <p>5</p>
    <p>Buf­feted by Covid-19 and set­backs on mul­ti­ple fronts, In­dia is turn­ing in­wards, which is bad news for its South-east Asian neigh­bours, says as­so­ciate ed­i­tor Ravi Vel­loor (be­low).</p>
    <p>When In­dia’s his­tory of the quar­ter-cen­tury is writ­ten, the last seven days of Au­gust 2020 will prob­a­bly go down as one of its most dis­mal pe­ri­ods.</p>
    <p>This was the week when the vast and densely pop­u­lated na­tion re­ported a global record in the daily rise in coro­n­avirus in­fec­tions and an econ­omy that con­tracted by nearly a quar­ter in the April-to-June pe­riod from a year ago. The bad news came amid re­ports of fresh Chi­nese mil­i­tary in­cur­sions on the Hi­malayan border, where the world’s largest stand­ing armies are in a tense face-off.</p>
    <p>To cap it all, Ja­pan’s Prime Min­is­ter Shinzo Abe, a staunch friend of the South Asian na­tion, un­ex­pect­edly said he was re­sign­ing to fo­cus on his health, po­ten­tially weak­en­ing a bi­lat­eral re­la­tion­ship seen as a key plank in Asia’s emerg­ing geopol­i­tics.</p>
    <p>Each of these developmen­ts im­pacts wider Asia even as they add up to a some­what un­flat­ter­ing pic­ture of the strate­gic re­flexes of Asia’s No. 3 econ­omy and mil­i­tary power. Worse, they could cause the stricken na­tion to with­draw into a sullen shell.</p>
    <p>As host to the world’s sec­ond-largest pop­u­la­tion and a close neigh­bour of China, it was in­evitable that In­dia could not be im­mune to the Covid-19 out­break first re­ported from that coun­try. As an econ­omy whose spend­ing on pub­lic health was al­ways in­ad­e­quate – 1.5 per cent of gross do­mes­tic prod­uct (GDP) ver­sus 6 per cent for China – it was also be­yond doubt that In­dia was ex­tremely vul­ner­a­ble to dis­ease out­breaks.</p>
    <p>Nev­er­the­less, the scale of the out­break has been stu­pe­fy­ing. Within a 24-hour pe­riod three no­ta­bles – a for­mer pres­i­dent, a doyen of In­dian diplo­macy and the na­tion’s first woman heart sur­geon – died of com­pli­ca­tions from the coro­n­avirus, just as Home Min­is­ter Amit Shah was re­leased from hospi­tal af­ter post-Covid-19 treat­ment.</p>
    <p>THE COVID-19 CALAMITY</p>
    <p>While the three dead were all above the age of 80, there is ev­ery chance that In­dia this week will pass Brazil for the sec­ond-high­est num­ber of coro­n­avirus cases world­wide. Adding to the worry, the out­break, once cen­tred in ur­ban ar­eas, is now fully within its vast hin­ter­land, which is sig­nif­i­cantly un­der­served for med­i­cal fa­cil­i­ties.</p>
    <p>Yet, it is not as if In­dia did not have ad­e­quate warn­ing about the threat. It be­gan sur­veil­lance mea­sures in mid-Jan­uary and its first case was re­ported on Jan 30 in the south­ern state of Ker­ala.</p>
    <p>In­cred­i­bly, in late Fe­bru­ary the govern­ment pro­ceeded to or­gan­ise two large pub­lic events in Prime Min­is­ter Naren­dra Modi’s home state of Gu­jarat – mass­ing peo­ple along the roads of the city of Ahmed­abad and in a sports sta­dium – for vis­it­ing United States Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump. For a while there­after, the cen­tral zone of Ahmed­abad be­came an epi­cen­tre of the virus.</p>
    <p>In the first half of March, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led govern­ment’s fo­cus seemed to be on top­pling the Congress Party-led state govern­ment in Mad­hya Pradesh, which it ac­com­plished on March 21. Three days later, with a mere four hours’ no­tice, Mr Modi or­dered a na­tion­wide lock­down – ini­tially for a three-week pe­riod, then for a fur­ther 19 days.</p>
    <p>Mil­lions of low-wage and mi­grant work­ers left job­less by the busi­ness shut­downs strug­gled to reach home, of­ten trudg­ing hun­dreds of kilo­me­tres on foot. The mea­sures may have bought a lit­tle time for the health au­thor­i­ties but by late April, there still were over 31,000 con­firmed cases – the num­ber dou­bling ap­prox­i­mately ev­ery nine days – and over 1,000 con­firmed deaths. On June 8, un­able to bear the eco­nomic pain, In­dia at­tempted a phased re­open­ing, and fur­ther eas­ing was done late last month.</p>
    <p>The lock­down crushed the econ­omy, as fig­ures for the June quar­ter showed. Growth had al­ready slowed con­sid­er­ably be­fore the virus struck, thanks in part to a bank­ing cri­sis and the lin­ger­ing ef­fects of Mr Modi’s sur­prise can­cel­la­tion of high-value cur­rency in late 2016, hurt­ing the cash-de­pen­dent econ­omy.</p>
    <p>Now, the pan­demic-led dis­rup­tion has laid it waste. Un­em­ploy­ment has more than tre­bled from the high sin­gle dig­its. Although some in­di­ca­tors – trac­tor sales and mo­tor­bike sales in par­tic­u­lar – are be­gin­ning to look healthy once again, large sec­tions of in­dus­try re­main list­less.</p>
    <p>CHINA MIS­STEPS</p>
    <p>As for tourism, even if do­mes­tic traf­fic re­vives, it will be years be­fore for­eign tourists think of In­dia as a safe des­ti­na­tion. Not en­tirely of its own fault, the goal of reach­ing US$5 tril­lion (S$6.8 tril­lion) in GDP by 2025 is out of reach.</p>
    <p>The mis­steps have been most pro­nounced with China. Lulled by the chem­istry he de­vel­oped with Mr Abe, which clearly prof­ited In­dia, Mr Modi seems to have let his guard down with Chi­nese</p>
    <p>Pres­i­dent Xi Jin­ping, who was sim­i­larly cul­ti­vated.</p>
    <p>Even as China’s “wolf war­rior” diplo­mats grew more vo­cal and its army more as­sertive around the dis­puted Sino-In­dian bound­ary for the past six years, a do­mes­ti­cally fo­cused In­dian govern­ment al­tered the ground sit­u­a­tion in dis­puted Jammu and Kash­mir, In­dia’s only Mus­lim-ma­jor­ity state, in Au­gust last year.</p>
    <p>Mak­ing good on elec­tion prom­ises, Mr Modi moved to curb the in­sur­gency-hit ter­ri­tory’s lim­ited au­ton­omy by with­draw­ing its state­hood and split­ting it into two fed­er­ally ad­min­is­tered ter­ri­to­ries. The Ladakh re­gion of the for­mer state abuts Ti­bet and Xin­jiang.</p>
    <p>Un­sur­pris­ingly, the move to “re­struc­ture” Jammu and Kash­mir did not go down well with China, which has held a swathe of con­tested ter­ri­tory in Ak­sai Chin from 1962. China Na­tional High­way 219, which con­nects Xin­jiang and Ti­bet, runs through the area.</p>
    <p>In­dia also com­pleted build­ing a high-alti­tude, all-weather road to a for­ward air base that could po­ten­tially curb China’s ac­cess to High­way 219 in a con­flict.</p>
    <p>The Chi­nese For­eign Min­istry swiftly re­sponded, urg­ing In­dia to be “cau­tious in its words and deeds on the border is­sue, strictly abide by the rel­e­vant agree­ments reached be­tween the two sides, and avoid tak­ing ac­tions that fur­ther com­pli­cate the border is­sue”.</p>
    <p>The warn­ings were dis­missed. Hav­ing stirred the pot, New Delhi was slow to pro­tect its claimed bound­ary. It was slow to move up troops into the icy Hi­malayan slopes of Ladakh this spring af­ter the snow melted and found Chi­nese troops al­ready in oc­cu­pa­tion of sev­eral key spots along the so-called Line of Ac­tual Con­trol, the un­de­mar­cated border, mak­ing its own ac­cess road vul­ner­a­ble.</p>
    <p>A deadly clash on June 15 saw the deaths of 20 In­dian sol­diers and an un­spec­i­fied num­ber of Chi­nese troops, the first mil­i­tary fa­tal­i­ties be­tween the two Asian gi­ants in more than three decades.</p>
    <p>De­spite ne­go­ti­a­tions at mil­i­tary and diplo­matic lev­els, the sit­u­a­tion only seems to get worse. This week, an Agence France-Presse re­port quoted a mem­ber of the Ti­betan Par­lia­ment-in-ex­ile as say­ing that a Ti­betan-ori­gin sol­dier with In­dian spe­cial forces had been killed on Satur­day night and an­other was wounded.</p>
    <p>In­dia’s ex­ter­nal in­tel­li­gence out­fit, the Re­search and Anal­y­sis Wing (RAW), is said to main­tain a divi­sion strength cadre of mostly Ti­betan emi­gres. Called the Spe­cial Fron­tier Force, it is se­cretly trained to be air­dropped into Ti­bet for sab­o­tage mis­sions.</p>
    <p>Given Chi­nese sen­si­tiv­i­ties about the Dalai Lama’s pres­ence in In­dia, New Delhi’s use of eth­nic Ti­betan forces, while meant to send a cal­i­brated warn­ing to Bei­jing, is an­other worry point.</p>
    <p>HAZ­ARDS OF AN ECHO CHAM­BER</p>
    <p>None of this is to ab­solve China of its share of the blame. Bei­jing has reg­u­larly trod on In­dian sen­si­tiv­i­ties on a va­ri­ety of is­sues, es­pe­cially as it watched the tight­en­ing US-In­dia se­cu­rity em­brace. All the more rea­son why In­dia should have been on guard.</p>
    <p>Given In­dia’s in­ten­si­fy­ing se­cu­rity and in­tel­li­gence co­op­er­a­tion with the US, Ja­pan, Tai­wan and Aus­tralia, in ad­di­tion to its own re­sources, it was bizarre that New Delhi seemed clue­less to Chi­nese in­ten­tions in the dis­puted bor­der­lands and its for­ward move­ment of pa­trols.</p>
    <p>Per­haps it has some­thing to do with the qual­ity of ad­vice it re­ceives. Last year, in a bu­reau­cratic ma­noeu­vre, the No. 2 man in RAW, known for his forth­right opin­ions, was sent into re­tire­ment rather than pro­moted to the top post.</p>
    <p>Like­wise, even as Mr Modi an­nounced on Aug 15 last year that he would ap­point a first-ever chief of de­fence staff, he waited for the blunt-spo­ken air force chief, se­nior-most of the three ser­vices chiefs, to re­tire last Septem­ber be­fore hand­ing the job to the su­per­an­nu­at­ing army chief, an of­fi­cer seen as more aligned with BJP think­ing. In­dia may be pay­ing the price for its lead­er­ship’s pen­chant for liv­ing in an echo cham­ber.</p>
    <p>These ten­sions are also a source of anx­i­ety for South-east Asia, sand­wiched as it is be­tween the gi­ants.</p>
    <p>Equally dis­ap­point­ing from a South-east Asian per­spec­tive, the In­dia that once con­fi­dently stepped out to face the world is in re­treat.</p>
    <p>Take Tata Group, In­dia’s most glob­alised con­glom­er­ate. Fif­teen years ago, the news was about Tata and other In­dian com­pa­nies pick­ing up as­sets over­seas.</p>
    <p>But Tata’s high-ticket ven­tures into Euro­pean com­pa­nies like Corus Steel are now look­ing ques­tion­able. The mar­quee brand Jaguar Land Rover, which it bought from Ford Mo­tor and turned around to great profit, has be­gun to be a drag on the group. This is pil­ing pres­sure on Tata’s man­age­ment to look even more to­wards home.</p>
    <p>RE­TREAT’S IM­PACT ON S-E ASIA</p>
    <p>The developmen­ts come at a time when the In­dian govern­ment it­self is deeply in­wardly fo­cused.</p>
    <p>In­deed, un­der Mr Modi, the state has grown more and more zeal­ous about pro­tect­ing its do­mes­tic mar­ket from out­siders. So­cial­ist-era slo­gans like “self-re­liance” are get­ting new life.</p>
    <p>It has raised tar­iffs for four years in a row and, last Novem­ber, an­nounced its with­drawal from ne­go­ti­a­tions for the Re­gional Com­pre­hen­sive Eco­nomic Part­ner­ship (RCEP), partly be­cause of fear of be­ing flooded by Chi­nese goods.</p>
    <p>It is note­wor­thy that In­dia is the rare Asian econ­omy that does not have China as its top trade part­ner. Last year, two-way trade with the US was US$143 bil­lion against US$84 bil­lion with China.</p>
    <p>Of course, there may come a day when it might rue its de­ci­sion to leave the RCEP.</p>
    <p>With China now show­ing in­ter­est in join­ing the Com­pre­hen­sive and Pro­gres­sive Agree­ment for Trans-Pa­cific Part­ner­ship, the am­bi­tious trade deal mid­wifed by Mr Abe af­ter Mr Trump with­drew the US from Trans-Pa­cific Part­ner­ship ne­go­ti­a­tions, it has left the field open even wider for Bei­jing to ori­ent the re­gional econ­omy to­wards it­self.</p>
    <p>An In­dia in re­treat isn’t good news for any­one, not even China.</p>
    <p>South-east Asia needs not only In­dia’s huge mar­kets but also its free-spend­ing tourists and agri­cul­tural and in­dus­trial pro­duce – per­haps even its strong voice in coun­cils.</p>
    <p>A shrunken and sullen In­dia would make for a less complete Asia, just as Europe is re­duced by not hav­ing Bri­tain in its fold.</p>
    <p>For coun­tries like Sin­ga­pore, which in­vested so much diplo­matic ef­fort to have New Delhi in­cluded in fo­rums such as the East Asia Sum­mit and full di­a­logue part­ner­ship sta­tus with Asean, it would be es­pe­cially dis­ap­point­ing.</p>
