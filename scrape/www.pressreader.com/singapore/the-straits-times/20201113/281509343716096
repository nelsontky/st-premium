    <p>The is­sue of po­lit­i­cal suc­ces­sion has cropped up again, af­ter former deputy prime min­is­ter S. Jayaku­mar urged the Prime Min­is­ter to stay on to lead Sin­ga­pore, if the Covid-19 cri­sis con­tin­ues.</p>
    <p>In a new book on gov­er­nance (Gov­ern­ing: A Sin­ga­pore Per­spec­tive) and in me­dia in­ter­views to pro­mote the book, Pro­fes­sor Jayaku­mar said: “If ‘nor­malcy’ has been re­stored be­fore the next GE, I think the public will sup­port his de­sire to step down as PM.</p>
    <p>“How­ever, if the cri­sis per­sists, I be­lieve many Sin­ga­pore­ans will want him to re­con­sider that as­pect of his time­line as well, and hand over only af­ter Sin­ga­pore has turned the dan­ger­ous corner.”</p>
    <p>It is still early days, but that sce­nario has to be con­sid­ered, Prof Jayaku­mar added. “Much will de­pend on the suc­cess of mea­sures taken to ad­dress both the health and eco­nomic fronts.”</p>
    <p>Mr Lee Hsien Loong, who be­came prime min­is­ter in Au­gust 2014, has said he hopes to step down as PM by the time he turns 70, which would be in Fe­bru­ary 2022.</p>
    <p>Prof Jayaku­mar is ar­tic­u­lat­ing a view com­monly held among a seg­ment of Sin­ga­pore­ans. Even be­fore the pan­demic struck, I’ve heard peo­ple – mostly from the Pi­o­neer or Merdeka gen­er­a­tion – ask how Sin­ga­pore will fare when PM Lee steps down.</p>
    <p>The 4G team is led by cur­rent Deputy Prime Min­is­ter Heng Swee Keat, 59, who was en­dorsed as their leader in Novem­ber 2018. He in turn chose Trade and Industry Min­is­ter Chan Chun Sing, 51, as his deputy.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore­ans un­der­stand­ably want a smooth po­lit­i­cal suc­ces­sion, to re­duce the po­ten­tial for sur­prises or con­flict, es­pe­cially in the mid­dle of a global pan­demic. But Sin­ga­pore­ans should also not be­come too over­wrought over who the fu­ture prime min­is­ter should be, or when he should as­sume power.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore has sur­vived two changes of PM and will sur­vive a third. Many par­lia­men­tary democ­ra­cies see much more fre­quent ro­ta­tions of PMs – Aus­tralia, Ja­pan, Bri­tain – and re­main high-func­tion­ing so­ci­eties, partly be­cause of strong in­sti­tu­tions.</p>
    <p>So with all due re­spect to Prof Jayaku­mar and those</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore­ans who urge PM Lee to stay on for an­other term or so, I must say I dis­agree.</p>
    <p>PM Lee should not tarry too long. In­stead, he should hand over to the next team soon af­ter the Covid-19 sit­u­a­tion has been brought un­der con­trol.</p>
    <p>Af­ter the Covid-19 cri­sis hit and he was asked if he saw him­self con­tin­u­ing as PM be­yond 70, he had said this de­pended on how the pan­demic can be brought un­der con­trol. He had promised to see through the Covid-19 cri­sis and to “hand over in good shape as soon as pos­si­ble to the next team, and into good hands”.</p>
    <p>Timely suc­ces­sion is im­por­tant be­cause it is vi­tal for po­lit­i­cal lead­ers to be re­newed to keep pace with gen­er­a­tional change in the pop­u­la­tion. Sin­ga­pore’s pop­u­la­tion is chang­ing rapidly.</p>
    <p>The July 10 Gen­eral Elec­tion is a vivid ex­am­ple of how fast the elec­torate’s ex­pec­ta­tions are chang­ing.</p>
    <p>The Peo­ple’s Ac­tion Party (PAP) gov­ern­ment had in­cum­bency ad­van­tage; a mas­sive war chest to fight Covid-19; and ran a rel­a­tively clean cam­paign that toned down its usual hardball pol­i­tics. And still it lost Sengkang GRC, a new es­tate that is the bell­wether of the fu­ture elec­torate. It could not take back Alju­nied GRC. It nearly lost West Coast GRC. It got 61.2 per cent vote share, the sec­ond low­est since in­de­pen­dence.</p>
    <p>Elec­tions are like a fam­ily cri­sis – they have a way of clar­i­fy­ing mat­ters and bring­ing to the sur­face la­tent un­hap­pi­ness and re­sent­ments oth­er­wise buried in daily life. While the PAP won a clear man­date, the elec­tion also showed that some vot­ers feel a dis­con­nect with the party.</p>
    <p>As a gov­ern­ment, PM Lee and his 3G team have presided over an econ­omy that has grown healthily, ex­panded so­cial safety nets gen­er­ously, and built an amaz­ing cityscape. Yet, it is also dur­ing their watch that in­come in­equal­ity has deep­ened; class di­vides have be­come more pro­nounced; and anti-for­eigner sen­ti­ments have risen.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, dis­rup­tion caused by tech­no­log­i­cal change is has­ten­ing as dig­i­tal­i­sa­tion takes root across work­places, thanks to Covid-19. The dis­rupted fu­ture is here among us, but many lo­cal en­ter­prises and work­ers, trapped by in­er­tia or ig­no­rance, are not ready.</p>
    <p>Pass­ing on the ba­ton to the 4G de­ci­sively al­lows a new gen­er­a­tion of lead­ers to re­think pos­si­bil­i­ties, ques­tion past as­sump­tions and forge a new so­cial com­pact with a new gen­er­a­tion.</p>
    <p>TEAM DY­NAM­ICS</p>
    <p>Some of those who want PM Lee to stay on for an­other term or more, pre­fer a longer run­way to al­low the 4G to de­cide among them­selves who should be their leader.</p>
    <p>Mr Heng suf­fered a stroke in</p>
    <p>May 2016, and the con­cern is who can take over as PM should his health fail, al­though he has made an ex­cel­lent re­cov­ery.</p>
    <p>Will there be ri­valry and po­lit­i­cal con­test, lead­ing to pol­icy dis­rup­tion and bu­reau­cratic in­fight­ing? While Mr Heng has de­scribed Mr Chan as his deputy, there are other prom­i­nent mem­bers of the 4G team such as Trans­port Min­is­ter Ong Ye Kung, 51 this year, and Ed­u­ca­tion Min­is­ter Lawrence Wong, 47.</p>
    <p>The think­ing is that a longer time­frame gives the 4G team time to work out its dy­nam­ics and iron out any la­tent ri­val­ries.</p>
    <p>This is a rea­son­able hope, ex­cept that it ig­nores the fact that the 4G has in fact al­ready picked its lead­ers, the way past gen­er­a­tions did. The 2020 elec­tion re­sults did not fun­da­men­tally change those dy­nam­ics.</p>
    <p>As is com­mon in par­lia­men­tary sys­tems, Sin­ga­pore’s first three PMs were cho­sen by peers within their party, not by vot­ers. Mr Lee Kuan Yew be­came PM af­ter a split vote within the PAP was bro­ken by party chair­man Toh Chin Chye who cast his de­cid­ing vote in Mr Lee’s favour.</p>
    <p>Mr Lee’s top picks to suc­ceed him did not in­clude Mr Goh Chok Tong; Mr Goh was picked by his peers and be­came PM in Novem­ber 1990.</p>
    <p>Mr Lee Hsien Loong took over from Mr Goh as PM in Au­gust 2004. PM Lee was both Mr Goh’s choice, and the choice of his peers.</p>
    <p>Mr Heng too is the choice of the 4G and he has picked Mr Chan to be his deputy. So the is­sue of suc­ces­sion to the PM post should be set­tled for now.</p>
    <p>In any case, the fo­cus on who should be PM should not be overblown.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore is not run by an in­di­vid­ual. Even the strong-willed Mr Lee Kuan Yew did not op­er­ate alone; he had a strong team to back him. To­gether, they steered Sin­ga­pore safely through the shoals of ex­is­ten­tial crises, and laid the foun­da­tion for its suc­cess.</p>
    <p>To­day’s far more com­plex world re­quires an equally strong team. PM Lee has re­minded Sin­ga­pore­ans of this, when he said in Jan­uary 2018: “Maybe it’s the way that the me­dia and public pol­i­tics is played in many coun­tries nowa­days, it’s per­son­alised as one per­son. And the face be­comes fa­mil­iar. And you think that ev­ery­thing is done by that per­son. Ac­tu­ally it’s not… there’s a team.</p>
    <p>“The team works to­gether and they have one, as Mr Lee Kuan</p>
    <p>Yew said, striker. Now you have to strike from time to time, but you’re re­ally also some­times spokesman on be­half of the team, bring­ing to­gether a col­lec­tive wis­dom and giv­ing voice to that. And I think in the next team, that as­pect of it will have to be even more im­por­tant.”</p>
    <p>The 4G team is al­ready tak­ing shape, with Mr Heng as leader. He was made first as­sis­tant sec­re­tary-gen­eral in Novem­ber 2018 and be­came deputy PM a few months later, in April last year.</p>
    <p>For con­ti­nu­ity, and to re­tain bal­last to the new team, a few key 3G min­is­ters can re­main in Cabi­net and be ac­ti­vated when needed, the way Se­nior Min­is­ters Teo Chee Hean and Thar­man Shan­mu­garat­nam were roped in to help fight Covid-19 af­ter hav­ing given up their deputy PM posts and min­is­te­rial port­fo­lios. Mr Teo was called in to help ad­vise an in­ter-agency task force set up to deal with the mas­sive out­break of Covid-19 in for­eign worker dor­mi­to­ries; and Mr Thar­man heads the Na­tional Jobs Coun­cil. When he steps down, PM Lee should stay on as SM in a 4G Cabi­net to share his ex­pe­ri­ence and to guide the team.</p>
    <p>The 3G showed their con­fi­dence in their younger col­leagues by ced­ing the front line of the Covid-19 fight to 4G min­is­ters – Health Min­is­ter Gan Kim Yong and Mr Wong, who co-chair the min­is­te­rial task force on Covid-19 and front the reg­u­lar me­dia con­fer­ences – and it has paid off well, as Sin­ga­pore­ans have a chance to hear from, as­sess and form a rap­port with them.</p>
    <p>Such bonds are formed only in the cru­cible of crises.</p>
    <p>As it is, Sin­ga­pore­ans are com­ing to ac­cept the 4G crop of lead­ers, who are do­ing a cred­itable job lead­ing the na­tion’s fight against Covid-19. A clear road map from lock­down to busi­ness-as-usual was planned months be­fore, and is slowly be­ing rolled out as in­di­ca­tors are met. In­fec­tion num­bers are down to sin­gle dig­its daily, mainly from im­ported cases which are quickly quar­an­tined and ring-fenced. An elec­tion took place with­out spark­ing a com­mu­nity out­break. The econ­omy is open­ing up, while in­fec­tion num­bers re­main low. Bor­ders are slowly re­open­ing. Public com­pli­ance with mask wear­ing and so­cial dis­tanc­ing is high, sug­gest­ing strong sup­port for such mea­sures.</p>
    <p>Thanks to the 3G step­ping aside to let the 4G lead, Sin­ga­pore­ans have a reser­voir of new im­ages to add to the po­lit­i­cal mem­ory, such as Mr Wong tear­ing up over the sac­ri­fices of front-line staff.</p>
    <p>It is from such shared mo­ments that gen­uine con­nec­tions are made, and un­der­stand­ing grows.</p>
    <p>The com­ing slew of con­ver­sa­tions, and the ac­tive agenda of pol­icy changes in the works, will give many Sin­ga­pore­ans the chance to hear from, meet, see and oth­er­wise ex­pe­ri­ence the 4G lead­ers.</p>
    <p>As a team, they must gel to­gether, man­age per­sonal com­pet­i­tive­ness, work to one an­other’s strengths, and tap the wis­dom and ex­pe­ri­ence of the 3G se­nior min­is­ters in their midst, to po­si­tion Sin­ga­pore smartly for the post-Covid-19 world.</p>
    <p>De­lay­ing the process of po­lit­i­cal tran­si­tion longer than nec­es­sary to tackle the pan­demic cri­sis will ham­per the abil­ity of the 4G to con­nect with Sin­ga­pore­ans – to lis­ten to them, to un­der­stand their as­pi­ra­tions, and to prove to them that they can de­liver.</p>
    <p>Thanks to the 3G step­ping aside to let the 4G lead, Sin­ga­pore­ans have a reser­voir of new im­ages to add to the po­lit­i­cal mem­ory, such as Mr Lawrence Wong tear­ing up over the sac­ri­fices of front-line staff.</p>
    <p>It is from such shared mo­ments that gen­uine con­nec­tions are made, and un­der­stand­ing grows.</p>
