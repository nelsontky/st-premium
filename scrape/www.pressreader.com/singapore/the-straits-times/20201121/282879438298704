    <p>Scot­tish-Amer­i­can nov­el­ist Dou­glas Stu­art won the Booker Prize for Fic­tion on Thurs­day for his de­but novel Shug­gie Bain.</p>
    <p>The book, about a young gay boy grow­ing up in work­ing-class Scot­land with an al­co­holic mother, re­ceived the pres­ti­gious £50,000 (S$89,100) award in a vir­tual cer­e­mony.</p>
    <p>Stu­art, 44, who works in fash­ion de­sign in New York, said in a video call that he was “ab­so­lutely stunned”.</p>
    <p>“I’d like to, first of all, just thank my mother,” he said. “I think I’ve been clear that my mother is on ev­ery page of this book and, with­out her, I wouldn’t be here and my work wouldn’t be here.”</p>
    <p>He grew up on a Glas­gow pub­lic hous­ing es­tate and was the youngest son of an al­co­holic sin­gle mother, who died when he was 16.</p>
    <p>“For 30 years, I’ve car­ried an aw­ful lot of loss, love and pain,” he said. “I wanted to re­ally just tell the story of what it was like to grow up queer in Glas­gow, to grow up with a par­ent whom you love, but couldn’t save.</p>
    <p>“Shug­gie is a work of fic­tion, but writ­ing the book was in­cred­i­bly heal­ing for me. I think men from the west coast of Scot­land are not ever ex­pected to be able to ex­press their finer feel­ings. Art is a great re­cep­ta­cle for that and to be able to con­nect with peo­ple, to ask for em­pa­thy from read­ers – and they’ve re­ally given it – has been just hugely cathar­tic.”</p>
    <p>Shug­gie Bain is the sec­ond Scot­tish book to win the prize, the other be­ing James Kel­man’s How Late It Was, How Late in 1994. Stu­art called Kel­man’s book his “Bi­ble” and said his own win “means a lot for re­gional voices, for work­ing-class sto­ries”.</p>
    <p>“Women like my mother were never voice­less,” he said. “By God, they could roar. But I think so­ci­ety doesn’t of­ten like to look. I think right now, we are po­lar­is­ing as a so­ci­ety and a lot of peo­ple are be­ing left be­hind, and that ter­ri­fies me.</p>
    <p>“As much as there’s vi­o­lence in the book, there’s enor­mous ten­der­ness. As much as there’s sad­ness, I hope there’s a lot of hu­mour, and that is the Glaswe­gian ex­pe­ri­ence.”</p>
    <p>Due to the Covid-19 pan­demic, the prize cer­e­mony was held vir­tu­ally at Lon­don arts venue The Round­house and broad­cast on­line.</p>
    <p>Ac­tors such as Thandie New­ton, Ann-Marie Duff and Nina Sosanya per­formed pre-recorded read­ings from the short­listed nov­els.</p>
    <p>The star-stud­ded event fea­tured speak­ers such as for­mer United States pres­i­dent Barack Obama, who on Tues­day pub­lished the first vol­ume of his block­buster mem­oir, A Promised Land; No­bel Lit­er­a­ture Lau­re­ate Kazuo Ishig­uro; and last year’s Booker co-win­ners Bernar­dine Evaristo and Mar­garet At­wood in con­ver­sa­tion.</p>
    <p>Mr Obama, 59, who is known to be an avid reader, said: “I am al­ways im­pressed by au­thors who can write in­cred­i­ble works of fic­tion – even if that’s what my crit­ics call my speeches.</p>
    <p>“Read­ing beau­ti­ful works of fic­tion late at night, Booker Prize-listed au­thors such as Mar­i­lynne Robinson, Col­son White­head, Bernar­dine Evaristo and so many oth­ers of­fered me a brief respite from the daily chal­lenges of the pres­i­dency.</p>
    <p>“At their best, Booker Prize-listed books re­mind me of fic­tion’s power to help us put our­selves in some­one else’s shoes, un­der­stand their strug­gles and imag­ine new ways to tackle com­plex prob­lems and ef­fect change.”</p>
    <p>This year’s short­list has been hailed as the most di­verse in the prize’s 51-year his­tory, dom­i­nated as it is by writ­ers of colour, women and de­but nov­el­ists.</p>
    <p>The other nov­els in the run­ning were Diane Cook’s dystopian cli­mate-cri­sis novel The New Wilder­ness; This Mourn­able Body by pi­o­neer Zim­bab­wean writer Tsitsi Dan­garem­bga; Burnt Sugar by Avni Doshi, about a toxic mother-daugh­ter re­la­tion­ship in In­dia; The Shadow King by Maaza Mengiste, about Ethiopian women sol­diers; and Bran­don Tay­lor’s cam­pus novel Real Life.</p>
    <p>For 30 years, I’ve car­ried an aw­ful lot of loss, love and pain. I wanted to re­ally just tell the story of what it was like to grow up queer in Glas­gow, to grow up with a par­ent whom you love, but couldn’t save. Shug­gie is a work of fic­tion, but writ­ing the book was in­cred­i­bly heal­ing for me.</p>
