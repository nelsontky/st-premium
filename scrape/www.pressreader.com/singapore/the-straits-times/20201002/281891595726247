    <p>•</p>
    <p>BRUS­SELS The uned­i­fy­ing spec­ta­cle of Tues­day night’s United States pres­i­den­tial de­bate pro­duced some shock, some sad­ness and some weari­ness among US al­lies and ri­vals alike the fol­low­ing day.</p>
    <p>As Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump bel­lowed, blus­tered and shouted down both mod­er­a­tor Chris Wal­lace and his op­po­nent, for­mer vice-pres­i­dent Joe Biden, and as Mr Biden re­sponded by call­ing Mr Trump a “clown”, many won­dered if the chaos and tenor of the event said some­thing more fun­da­men­tal about the state of Amer­i­can democ­racy.</p>
    <p>“Of course, the ul­ti­mate ar­biter will be the Amer­i­can voter,” said Mr Ul­rich Speck, an an­a­lyst with the Ger­man Mar­shall Fund in Ber­lin.</p>
    <p>“But there is a con­sen­sus in Europe that this is get­ting out of hand, and this de­bate is an in­di­ca­tor of the bad shape of the Amer­i­can democ­racy.”</p>
    <p>There was al­ways a sense among al­lies that in Amer­ica, de­spite po­lit­i­cal dis­agree­ment, “there is one repub­lic, and con­flict will be solved by de­bate and com­pro­mise”, and “that power was mar­ried to some kind of moral­ity”, Mr Speck said.</p>
    <p>But that view is now be­ing ques­tioned, he said. “The de­bate was re­ally no de­bate at all, but two peo­ple pur­su­ing their strate­gies.”</p>
    <p>Many, if not most, Euro­pean an­a­lysts blamed Mr Trump for the mess.</p>
    <p>“The de­bate was a joke, a low point, a shame for the coun­try,” Mr Markus Feldenkirc­hen of the Ger­man news magazine Der Spiegel posted on Twit­ter.</p>
    <p>“Roar­ing, in­sults, two over-70s who in­ter­rupt each other like fiveyear-olds – and a mod­er­a­tor who loses all con­trol. The trig­ger, of course: Trump’s un­couth, undig­ni­fied be­hav­iour.”</p>
    <p>Mr John Saw­ers, a for­mer Bri­tish diplo­mat and head of a risk anal­y­sis firm, said sim­ply: “My own re­sponse is that it makes me de­spon­dent about Amer­ica. The coun­try we have looked to for lead­er­ship has de­scended into an ugly brawl.”</p>
    <p>Mr Jeremy Shapiro, a for­mer US diplo­mat, said that for­eign­ers would prob­a­bly view the de­bate “as another sign of the degra­da­tion of Amer­i­can democ­racy”.</p>
    <p>Both al­lies and ri­vals “see Trump and the po­lit­i­cal cul­ture that cre­ated him herald­ing the de­cline of Amer­i­can democ­racy and Amer­i­can cul­ture”, Mr Shapiro said.</p>
    <p>Ms Ni­cole Bacha­ran, a FrenchAmer­i­can his­to­rian and po­lit­i­cal an­a­lyst who lives in France, said she was “dis­mayed”, by what she saw in the de­bate, adding: “It sent a de­press­ing image of the United States, of the Amer­i­can democ­racy and its role in the world.”</p>
    <p>The events seem bound to heighten Euro­pean anx­i­eties, Ms Bacha­ran said.</p>
    <p>The dam­age that has been done to trans-At­lantic re­la­tions, will at best take years to re­pair, she added.</p>
    <p>“The truth is, the Euro­pean lead­ers feel alone be­cause they know that what Trump has dis­man­tled can­not be re­built so quickly and so eas­ily,” she said.</p>
    <p>“As for the oth­ers, Putin, Bol­sonaro, Er­do­gan, they must be telling them­selves what we al­ready knew: They can do every­thing, be­cause the US isn’t a leader any­more.”</p>
    <p>That was cer­tainly the quick view in China, where of­fi­cial re­ac­tion was care­ful but that of the Global Times, a Com­mu­nist Party pro­pa­ganda sheet, was glee­ful.</p>
    <p>Mr Hu Xi­jin, the pa­per’s ed­i­tor, said that Mr Trump and Mr Biden “ob­vi­ously did not show an ex­em­plary role to Amer­i­can peo­ple on how to en­gage in de­bates”.</p>
    <p>He added: “Such a chaos at the top of US pol­i­tics re­flects di­vi­sion, anx­i­ety of US so­ci­ety and the ac­cel­er­at­ing loss of ad­van­tages of the US po­lit­i­cal sys­tem.”</p>
    <p>In Ja­pan, many were taken aback when Mr Biden told Mr Trump at one point to “shut up, man”, said Mr Ichiro Fu­jisaki, a for­mer Ja­pa­nese am­bas­sador to the US.</p>
    <p>“If the Pres­i­dent says that, ev­ery­one takes it as nat­u­ral,” he added, “but for a de­cent man like Biden to say that is a bit of a sur­prise”.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump has at­tempted to quell the up­roar over his fail­ure to ex­plic­itly de­nounce white supremacis­t groups dur­ing the de­bate.</p>
    <p>He had given a shout-out to far­right mili­tia group Proud Boys, say­ing they should “stand back and stand by”, and that the real prob­lem is “far-left” ex­trem­ists.</p>
    <p>On Wed­nes­day Mr Trump, in an ap­par­ent at­tempt to tamp down outrage over his com­ments, called on the group to “stand down”.</p>
    <p>“I don’t know who Proud Boys are but who­ever they are they have to stand down,” he told re­porters.</p>
    <p>“Stand down, let law en­force­ment do their work.”</p>
