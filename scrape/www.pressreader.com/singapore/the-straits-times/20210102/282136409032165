    <p>Is Texas the new Sil­i­con Val­ley? Last month, Or­a­cle said it was mov­ing its head­quar­ters to Austin af­ter more than 40 years in Cal­i­for­nia. Hewlett Packard En­ter­prise, de­scended from the Val­ley’s orig­i­nal garage start-up, is off to Hous­ton. Mr Elon Musk has moved to Texas, too, and has hinted that Tesla, the car com­pany he co-founded and leads, may also re­lo­cate.</p>
    <p>Or could Mi­ami be­come the next Sil­i­con Val­ley? That’s what Mr Keith Rabois, a prom­i­nent</p>
    <p>Bay Area in­vestor, has been pro­claim­ing since his re­cent move there from San Fran­cisco.</p>
    <p>In con­trast to the anti-tech sen­ti­ment roil­ing San Fran­cisco – whose board of su­per­vi­sors re­cently passed a res­o­lu­tion con­demn­ing the re­nam­ing of the city’s gen­eral hospi­tal af­ter Face­book’s chief ex­ec­u­tive Mark Zucker­berg – Mayor Fran­cis Suarez of Mi­ami has turned his Twit­ter feed into a non-stop pitch for tech en­trepreneur­s and in­vestors to re­lo­cate to his city.</p>
    <p>The news came at the end of a year of big dis­rup­tions in the geog­ra­phy of the tech in­dus­try. Grand com­pany cam­puses emp­tied, Sil­i­con Val­ley’s wealthy de­camped to mountain and is­land re­treats and tech work­ers traded in their high-priced San Fran­cisco apart­ments for roomier, cheaper real es­tate through­out the United States. Many may not go back.</p>
    <p>Google, whose perk-drenched cul­ture set trends that other com­pa­nies fol­lowed, is con­sid­er­ing a “flex­i­ble work­week”, de­liv­er­ing what many tech em­ploy­ees have long cov­eted: three days in the of­fice and two work­ing from home.</p>
    <p>ZOOM VER­SUS 20-MINUTE RULE</p>
    <p>Sil­i­con Val­ley’s grip on how start-ups find in­vestors also has bro­ken down in the Covid-19 era. Ven­ture cap­i­tal­ists in the re­gion have long believed in the “20-minute rule”: Any com­pany they backed needed to be within a short drive of their of­fices.</p>
    <p>That dic­tum feels ob­so­lete now that in­vestors have spent 10 months mak­ing early-stage deals via Zoom.</p>
    <p>Af­ter a sum­mer of wild­fire smoke-filled skies and new</p>
    <p>San Fran­cisco leg­is­la­tion that fur­ther taxes cor­po­rate prof­its, ven­ture cap­i­tal­ists have re­cently been com­plain­ing that Cal­i­for­nia has be­come in­hos­pitable to both peo­ple and busi­nesses.</p>
    <p>Sil­i­con Val­ley’s obit­u­ary has been writ­ten pre­ma­turely be­fore; boom-and-bust cy­cles have de­fined the re­gion’s econ­omy for decades.</p>
    <p>In the early 1970s, cuts in mil­i­tary spend­ing led to lay­offs at large Cal­i­for­nia com­pa­nies, and ven­ture cap­i­tal fund­ing dried up. While the state’s semi­con­duc­tor in­dus­try strug­gled to com­pete with Ja­panese elec­tron­ics busi­nesses in the early 1980s, that era also saw the ar­rival of the per­sonal com­puter mar­ket and the emer­gence of con­sumer-fac­ing tech su­per­stars such as Ap­ple and Atari.</p>
    <p>The out­look clouded in the early 1990s, as the Cold War ended, the desk­top com­puter mar­ket plateaued and the US spi­ralled into re­ces­sion.</p>
    <p>Then, the com­mer­cial­i­sa­tion of the In­ter­net set off a Val­ley boom greater than any be­fore it, turn­ing com­pa­nies like Netscape, Ya­hoo and eBay into house­hold names.</p>
    <p>In 2001, the dot.com bust turned the Val­ley into a de­jected land­scape of empty cu­bi­cles and pink-slip par­ties.</p>
    <p>SOURCE OF RESILIENCE</p>
    <p>Com­plaints about the Bay Area’s cost of liv­ing have been peren­nial, as well. High hous­ing prices pro­pelled some tech com­pa­nies to re­lo­cate to smaller cities, in­clud­ing Austin, in the early</p>
    <p>1980s (“Sil­i­con Val­ley in Calif. Los­ing Out to Sun Belt,” The Wash­ing­ton Post wrote in 1982).</p>
    <p>Busi­ness lead­ers have been com­plain­ing about Cal­i­for­nia’s high taxes – and threat­en­ing to leave – for even longer.</p>
    <p>Sil­i­con Val­ley al­ways roared back, each time greater than the last. One se­cret to its resilience: money.</p>
    <p>The wealth cre­ated by each boom – flow­ing chiefly to an elite cir­cle of ven­ture in­vestors and lucky founders – out­lasted each bust.</p>
    <p>No other tech re­gion has gen­er­ated such wealth and in­dus­try-spe­cific ex­per­tise, which is why it has had such resilience. That re­mains the case to­day.</p>
    <p>More than US$220 bil­lion</p>
    <p>(S$289 bil­lion) in ven­ture cap­i­tal in­vest­ment has poured into the Bay Area since 2015, and mon­ster public of­fer­ings have made ear­lier booms pale in com­par­i­son.</p>
    <p>Netscape, the browser com­pany that ig­nited the dot.com boom, ended its first day of Wall Street trad­ing with a valu­a­tion equiv­a­lent to about US$3.7 bil­lion in to­day’s dol­lars. In con­trast, Airbnb topped US$100 bil­lion in its first day of trad­ing this month.</p>
    <p>But the Covid-19 pan­demic has dis­rupted fa­mil­iar pat­terns. The switch to re­mote work pro­vided an es­cape hatch for Bay Area work­ers and com­pa­nies des­per­ate for cheaper, eas­ier places to live, adding to the 16 per cent of in­for­ma­tion in­dus­try em­ploy­ees across the coun­try who al­ready worked re­motely.</p>
    <p>Tech al­ready was mov­ing out, too. Some of the most suc­cess­ful start-ups of the past decade were founded out­side Sil­i­con Val­ley.</p>
    <p>TEXAS AND MI­AMI</p>
    <p>An in­creas­ing num­ber of the com­pa­nies are head­quar­tered out­side the coun­try al­to­gether.</p>
    <p>Which brings us back to Austin and Mi­ami. The lack of state in­come taxes in both places is one lure for tech’s wealthy, but this is about more than taxes.</p>
    <p>Texas has been a high-tech state for more than half a cen­tury, home to the Na­tional Aero­nau­tics and Space Ad­min­is­tra­tion’s Mis­sion Con­trol Cen­tre, ma­jor elec­tron­ics and com­puter com­pa­nies and re­search cen­tres.</p>
    <p>As Stan­ford Univer­sity and the Univer­sity of Cal­i­for­nia at Berke­ley did in Sil­i­con Val­ley, the Univer­sity of Texas has spent decades in­vest­ing in science and engi­neer­ing pro­grammes in Austin. Long home to Dell Com­puter and dozens of other com­pa­nies, Austin is an overnight suc­cess story more than 50 years in the mak­ing.</p>
    <p>Mi­ami does not have a long his­tory as a tech hub. But it is al­ready home to the Latin Amer­i­can head­quar­ters of ma­jor tech com­pa­nies, and it has at­tracted for­eign-born en­trepreneur­s seek­ing to build a global cus­tomer base.</p>
    <p>THE BIG­GEST THREAT</p>
    <p>This un­der­scores another cru­cial point: The big­gest threat to Sil­i­con Val­ley’s dom­i­nance does not come from within the US. It comes from the rest of the world.</p>
    <p>The pan­demic year sped up trends al­ready in mo­tion: the glob­al­i­sa­tion of tech in­vest­ment; the mar­ket power of Chi­nese su­per­stars such as Alibaba, Huawei and ByteDance; the tech start-ups flour­ish­ing on ev­ery con­ti­nent. These trends point to an im­por­tant les­son for those con­cerned about where and how tech grows.</p>
    <p>Mi­grat­ing tech moguls may com­plain about govern­ment weigh­ing them down, but</p>
    <p>Sil­i­con Val­ley blos­somed in the first place thanks in large part to huge govern­ment in­vest­ments in higher ed­u­ca­tion and re­search, as well as im­mi­gra­tion poli­cies that en­cour­aged peo­ple to come to the US to study, work, raise fam­i­lies and build Amer­i­can lives.</p>
    <p>The US no longer in­vests like it used to, and a re­stric­tive ap­proach to im­mi­gra­tion has placed a chill on the re­cruit­ment of for­eign tal­ent that will not eas­ily be shaken off de­spite a change in ad­min­is­tra­tions.</p>
    <p>As a re­sult, com­pa­nies based in the US have to hope that Amer­i­can school sys­tems will pro­duce the next Jack Ma, or be will­ing to let promis­ing tal­ent work from wher­ever they want to live. Af­ter all, skilled and en­tre­pre­neur­ial peo­ple do not need to be in</p>
    <p>Sil­i­con Val­ley to make it in tech. They don’t even need to come to the US. This is the re­gion’s big­gest chal­lenge – not the mi­gra­tion of a few com­pa­nies to Texas.</p>
    <p>Sil­i­con Val­ley’s obit­u­ary has been writ­ten pre­ma­turely be­fore... It al­ways roared back, each time greater than the last.</p>
    <p>One se­cret to its resilience: money. The wealth cre­ated by each boom – flow­ing chiefly to an elite cir­cle of ven­ture in­vestors and lucky founders – out­lasted each bust.</p>
    <p>No other tech re­gion has gen­er­ated such wealth and in­dus­try-spe­cific ex­per­tise, which is why it has had such resilience. That re­mains the case to­day.</p>
