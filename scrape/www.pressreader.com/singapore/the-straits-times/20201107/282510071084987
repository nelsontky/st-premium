    <p>The role of com­mu­nity hos­pi­tals will grow as Sin­ga­pore’s pop­u­la­tion ages and chronic dis­eases be­come more fre­quent in the com­ing years.</p>
    <p>Se­nior Min­is­ter and Co­or­di­nat­ing Min­is­ter for So­cial Poli­cies Thar­man Shan­mu­garat­nam said this in his ad­dress to view­ers at a vir­tual charity con­cert, Voices Of Light, or­gan­ised by St Luke’s Hospi­tal yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>In his ad­dress, Mr Thar­man em­pha­sised the im­por­tance of com­mu­nity hos­pi­tals in Sin­ga­pore’s evolv­ing health­care and so­cial sup­port sys­tem.</p>
    <p>“Well be­yond Covid, the role of our com­mu­nity hos­pi­tals like St Luke’s will grow. Like ev­ery so­ci­ety as it gets older, chronic dis­eases be­come much more fre­quent, more pro­nounced.</p>
    <p>“The best way to deal with peo­ple with chronic dis­eases, to pro­vide the best pos­si­ble care for them, is not just in acute hos­pi­tals when they need op­er­a­tions, but by help­ing them and car­ing for them af­ter the op­er­a­tions,” said Mr Thar­man.</p>
    <p>He cited phys­io­ther­apy, oc­cu­pa­tional and speech ther­apy as ar­eas of care that com­mu­nity hos­pi­tals pro­vide.</p>
    <p>Not­ing how St Luke’s Hospi­tal has been car­ing for its pa­tients in a holis­tic way since it ac­cepted its first pa­tient in 1996, Mr Thar­man added that this whole care pro­vi­sion around the pa­tient was “not just the phys­i­cal and med­i­cal as­pects, but also the so­cial and emo­tional”.</p>
    <p>With sev­eral fund-rais­ing events can­celled, St Luke’s Hospi­tal or­gan­ised the vir­tual charity con­cert for the first time this year, rais­ing $600,000 for their pa­tients in need.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing the con­cert, donors were treated to per­for­mances by home­grown so­prano-soloist Lau­ren Yeo, vi­o­lin­ist Yap Shu Mei and</p>
    <p>singer-song­writer Crys­tal Goh.</p>
    <p>The hospi­tal’s front-line staff were also part of a dance that was chore­ographed by jazz dance spe­cial­ist Sin­clair Ang and per­formed</p>
    <p>in the hospi­tal gym.</p>
    <p>The con­cert ended with a choir per­for­mance put to­gether by vol­un­teers from the hospi­tal’s foun­da­tion.</p>
    <p>As the first hospi­tal in Sin­ga­pore ded­i­cated to se­niors with ill­nesses, St Luke’s Hospi­tal has ex­panded its ser­vices and cur­rently cares for 2,000 in­pa­tients and 3,000 out­pa­tients each year.</p>
    <p>The hospi­tal thanked donors for their sup­port to pa­tients amid the Covid-19 pan­demic.</p>
    <p>A spokesman for the hospi­tal said: “As a charity, St Luke’s Hospi­tal raises funds to meet the needs of pa­tients.</p>
    <p>“Chronic con­di­tions such as di­a­betes must still be man­aged. Wounds must still be cleaned. Ther­apy is still needed so peo­ple can re­gain their abil­ity to carry out ac­tiv­i­ties of daily liv­ing. Per­sons with de­men­tia and their care­givers still need help cop­ing day and night.</p>
    <p>“The con­cert is our big­gest fundraiser of the year and it has raised $600,000 to date.</p>
    <p>“This is a sig­nif­i­cant amount by any mea­sure, all the more so con­sid­er­ing the eco­nomic down­turn.</p>
    <p>“We are grate­ful to our donors for their kind­ness, and to the con­cert per­form­ers and crew for their hard work.”</p>
