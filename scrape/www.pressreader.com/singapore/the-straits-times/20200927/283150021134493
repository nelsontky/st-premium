    <p>If you are 41 and older this year and not se­verely dis­abled, you have a choice on whether to sign up for CareShield Life.</p>
    <p>More de­tails on how to sign up will be an­nounced next year, but, to make it eas­ier, if you are be­tween 41 and 50 and on the older ElderShiel­d 400 scheme, you will be au­to­mat­i­cally en­rolled into the new scheme un­less you opt out.</p>
    <p>Those who sign up will have to pay an­nual pre­mi­ums un­til they are 67. If you join CareShield Life at age 59 or older, you will pay pre­mi­ums for 10 years. Pre­mium pay­ments will stop once a suc­cess­ful claim is made due to se­vere dis­abil­ity.</p>
    <p>If your de­ci­sion is de­pen­dent on how much pre­mium you will be pay­ing, you can use the pre­mium cal­cu­la­tor on the CareShield Life web­site to get an es­ti­mate of the amount that is ap­pli­ca­ble to you.</p>
    <p>The new scheme pro­vides an op­por­tu­nity for those who did not en­rol in ElderShiel­d to con­sider do­ing so when the ap­pli­ca­tion opens next year. But th­ese folks are likely to pay a higher pre­mium com­pared with those on the ElderShiel­d scheme, who will be able to switch over with­out los­ing their ben­e­fits.</p>
    <p>Ul­ti­mately, is CareShield Life a worth­while op­tion?</p>
    <p>For those who have built up healthy bal­ances in their Medis­ave ac­counts, the an­swer must be an un­equiv­o­cal “yes”, be­cause the yearly in­ter­est alone should be able to cover the pre­mium.</p>
    <p>Con­sider this: If you do not sign up for CareShield Life now, you may not be able to with­draw as much as you like from Medis­ave for your needs in later years.</p>
    <p>And, just like any bank ac­count, the funds in your Medis­ave may also not last very long if you use them of­ten. For in­stance, the yearly Medis­ave with­drawal limit for re­ha­bil­i­ta­tive care in com­mu­nity hos­pi­tals is only $5,000, or about $416 a month, which is sig­nif­i­cantly lower than the monthly pay­outs from CareShield Life.</p>
    <p>If you do a sim­ple cal­cu­la­tion, us­ing the es­ti­mated pre­mium and the num­ber of years you need to pay for it, you will re­alise that the to­tal sum is likely to be less than $15,000, even for those who have never joined ElderShiel­d.</p>
    <p>So how do you make plans with th­ese num­bers?</p>
    <p>Let’s take John, a pro­fes­sional in his early 50s who eats healthily and ex­er­cises daily be­cause he is keen to have a healthy re­tire­ment.</p>
    <p>As he is con­scious of his health, he has in­vested in a com­pre­hen­sive</p>
    <p>In­te­grated Shield Plan that will pay for all his med­i­cal bills in the event he falls sick. So far he has not needed to use his Medis­ave funds ex­cept for the an­nual pay­ment for the ba­sic MediShield Life pol­icy as well as the ad­di­tional $600 with­drawal to sub­sidise his pri­vate health­care in­sur­ance, which is mostly paid with cash.</p>
    <p>John did not sign up for ElderShiel­d, but plans to join CareShield Life next year be­cause he has am­ple funds in his Medis­ave to do so.</p>
    <p>As his bal­ance earns 4 per cent in­ter­est an­nu­ally, the in­ter­est earned is more than enough to pay the an­nual pre­mium of about $700.</p>
    <p>While he hopes to be healthy in his later years and avoid be­com­ing se­verely dis­abled, this is pru­dent fi­nan­cial plan­ning be­cause he has pre­pared for the worst-case sce­nario.</p>
    <p>If he be­comes an in­valid in old age, he can take com­fort that the com­bined monthly pay­outs from CPF Life and CareShield Life can help to pay for his own needs – with­out im­pos­ing a great bur­den on his chil­dren – even if he has de­pleted his own sav­ings.</p>
    <p>This is what pru­dent plan­ning is all about – you plan when you are healthy so that you do not face fi­nan­cial stress when you are un­well.</p>
