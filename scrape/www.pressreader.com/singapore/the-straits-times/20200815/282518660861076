    <p>Down­siz­ing is al­ways a chal­lenge, more so if it in­volves mov­ing five peo­ple from a four-room Hous­ing Board flat to a two-bed­room con­do­minium.</p>
    <p>This is ex­actly what pi­lot Steven Eu did to­gether with his wife, Ms Ge­lene Lim, who is a cabin crew mem­ber, their two daugh­ters aged seven and four, and a do­mes­tic helper.</p>
    <p>They en­listed the help of Mr Lawrence Puah, de­sign di­rec­tor of home-grown bou­tique in­te­rior de­sign con­sul­tancy ak­iHAUS De­sign Stu­dio, after com­ing across one of his projects at The Sor­rento in West Coast Road, which was fea­tured in Home & Decor.</p>
    <p>“The home is small like ours and we like its monochro­matic pal­ette and the use of space,” says Mr Eu of the in­spi­ra­tion.</p>
    <p>The Sor­rento home had a bed­room wall re­placed with slid­ing­fold­ing pan­els so that the room could be opened up to cre­ate more space or closed off when de­sired.</p>
    <p>Mr Eu and Ms Lim wanted a sim­i­lar mov­able wall con­cept for their 550 sq ft con­do­minium apart­ment in Bart­ley, but Mr Puah ad­vised against it. He says: “Un­like The Sor­rento, which is home to a bach­e­lorette, the de­sign con­sid­er­a­tions for a fam­ily home are en­tirely dif­fer­ent. The site con­di­tions are also dis­sim­i­lar. One fewer wall also means one fewer ver­ti­cal sur­face for stor­age or other fix­tures.”</p>
    <p>In­stead, he pro­posed to re­lo­cate the ex­ist­ing kitchen to free up space in the cen­tre of the home, both phys­i­cally and vis­ually.</p>
    <p>The new kitchen is now di­rectly be­yond the main en­trance, sep­a­rated by a full-height wall that not only screens off the area and defines the en­trance foyer, but also pro­vides a back­drop for the kitchen on the other side. More im­por­tantly, it in­cor­po­rates valu­able built-in stor­age cab­i­nets.</p>
    <p>The open-con­cept kitchen is small but packed with draw­ers and cab­i­nets be­low and above the kitchen counter. Ms Lim says: “The kitchen counter is very ver­sa­tile. It not only dou­bles as a din­ing ta­ble, but my el­der daugh­ter also does her home­work on it, while Steven and I some­times use it as a work desk.”</p>
    <p>As with the rest of the home, ev­ery con­ceiv­able sur­face of the liv­ing area has been de­signed to max­imise the us­able space.</p>
    <p>The tele­vi­sion set and more stor­age have been built into the fea­ture wall. A sofa with an in­te­grated side ta­ble al­lows the home own­ers to do away with a cof­fee ta­ble, so that there is room in the liv­ing area for the girls to play.</p>
    <p>The master bed­room’s clean de­sign mir­rors the rest of the apart­ment, with a queen-size stor­age bed help­ing to keep the area clut­ter-free.</p>
    <p>The at­tached bath­room is also the com­mon bath­room, which can be ac­cessed via a sec­ond door along the cor­ri­dor. “We have a bath­roomshar­ing roster, but since Steven and I are trav­el­ling for work half the time, it re­ally isn’t that much of an is­sue,” says Ms Lim.</p>
    <p>The girls share a room with the helper and it has been de­signed to be prac­ti­cal yet fun. The orig­i­nal built-in wardrobe was re­placed with one that wraps around the sleep­ing area like a por­tal frame. “This not only max­imises the builtin stor­age, but also cre­ates a cosy sleep­ing nook,” says Mr Puah.</p>
    <p>Bunk beds with a pull-out bed at the bot­tom would have been the ob­vi­ous choice, but his ra­tio­nale is that the bed oc­cu­pies space even when not in use. This was why he con­vinced the clients to go with fu­tons in­stead.</p>
    <p>“This frees up space within the room as the fu­tons are rolled out only at bed­time,” he says.</p>
    <p>The de­sign and ren­o­va­tion took about four to five months and cost $70,000. Since mov­ing in in Septem­ber 2019, the fam­ily has got­ten ac­cus­tomed to liv­ing in a small space.</p>
    <p>“It has taught us to be more dis­ci­plined and or­gan­ised. The girls have also learnt to re­turn their toys to their orig­i­nal stor­age cab­i­net when they are done play­ing,” says Ms Lim.</p>
    <p>Mr Eu adds with a chuckle: “It’s like be­ing in­side an air­craft. Ev­ery­thing has to be stowed away be­fore land­ing.”</p>
