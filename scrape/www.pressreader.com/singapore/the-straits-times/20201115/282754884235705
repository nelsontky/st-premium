    <p>Cars may be de­pre­ci­at­ing as­sets in Sin­ga­pore and are gen­er­ally re­garded as a poor in­vest­ment from a fi­nan­cial stand­point, but Singlife founder and group chief ex­ec­u­tive Wal­ter de Oude con­sid­ers his car – a 2005 As­ton Martin DB9 – a great in­vest­ment.</p>
    <p>The 47-year-old South African na­tive, who be­came a Sin­ga­pore per­ma­nent res­i­dent in 2008, thinks that older cars in Sin­ga­pore are good in­vest­ments be­cause they do not de­pre­ci­ate in value as much, are not as ex­pen­sive to main­tain as many would think and can al­ways be resold or ex­ported.</p>
    <p>Mr de Oude, who bought his car for $125,000 in Oc­to­ber last year, es­ti­mates that he can sell it any time for about $105,000 as an ex­port ve­hi­cle.</p>
    <p>He ex­plained: “If I choose to hold on to my car for five years, that’s a $4,000 de­pre­ci­a­tion per year. It in­curs an an­nual road tax of $9,000, insurance at $2,400 a year, and I bud­get $5,000 for main­te­nance an­nu­ally.</p>
    <p>“So the cost of run­ning the car is $20,400 for the year, or $1,700 a month – which is still a great value when you get to drive one of the most awe­some cars ever.”</p>
    <p>When it comes to his port­fo­lio, Mr de Oude has put most of his money into his com­pany, be­liev­ing that his en­er­gies and money are bet­ter placed in the business that he is grow­ing and build­ing.</p>
    <p>His in­vest­ment strat­egy has al­ways been about putting his money where he can add value, he said.</p>
    <p>The eco­nom­ics grad­u­ate from the Univer­sity of the Wit­wa­ter­srand, Johannesbu­rg, started in­surtech firm Singlife in 2014 with a num­ber of an­gel in­vestors, rais­ing an ini­tial cap­i­tal of around $2 mil­lion.</p>
    <p>Prior to found­ing Singlife, Mr de Oude was the CEO of HSBC Insurance in Sin­ga­pore, and be­fore that he worked at in­surer Swiss Re.</p>
    <p>The com­pany now has a val­u­a­tion of about $500 mil­lion, and is ex­pected to have a com­bined mar­ket cap­i­tal­i­sa­tion of $3.2 bil­lion when its merger with Aviva Sin­ga­pore is com­pleted next year.</p>
    <p>The home-grown firm is look­ing to con­tinue its ex­pan­sion into mar­kets be­yond Sin­ga­pore and the Philip­pines fol­low­ing its merger, said Mr de Oude, who has two sons aged 14 and 12 with his wife, who is also South African.</p>
    <p>Grow­ing up in South Africa with two broth­ers, his child­hood was about ex­plor­ing and play­ing out­side, and school was an ac­tiv­ity and not a gate­way to a ca­reer, he said, adding that he does not re­mem­ber ever be­ing pres­sured about grades by his par­ents.</p>
    <p>He said: “As my kids grow up in bustling Sin­ga­pore, I hope I can still share with them the val­ues of play­ful in­trigue and the urge to ex­plore and dis­cover new things.</p>
    <p>“While aca­demics are im­por­tant, the op­por­tu­nity to have a bal­anced child­hood is what adds qual­ity to life, and prob­a­bly makes them bet­ter pre­pared for all that the fu­ture holds for them.”</p>
    <p>Q What’s in your per­sonal port­fo­lio? A The ma­jor­ity of my wealth is in Singlife eq­uity. I be­lieve in in­vest­ing in my­self, so the best place for my money is in a business that I can help to grow and build.</p>
    <p>That said, I do also in­vest in fund port­fo­lios that are suit­able for my risk pro­file.</p>
    <p>Since I don’t have the time or the skills to look at in­di­vid­ual stocks or as­sets, I tend to put ex­cess sav­ings into some­thing that I know fund port­fo­lio man­agers can do for me in­stead. I never look for short-term quick gains.</p>
    <p>The port­fo­lios I chose to in­vest in have a bal­ance of dif­fer­ent as­set classes. I am a lit­tle long in cash at the mo­ment and have been slow to en­ter the mar­ket. I tell my­self that it’s to wait for the right op­por­tu­nity, but the truth is that it’s chal­leng­ing find­ing the time to get it done.</p>
    <p>My re­turns, apart from that from Singlife, have been av­er­age. I ac­cept that things go up and down, you can’t time the mar­kets, and one fund doesn’t al­ways do bet­ter than oth­ers – but at least I stay in­vested.</p>
    <p>Q What are your im­me­di­ate in­vest­ment plans?</p>
    <p>A As my other in­vest­ments grow over time, I will prob­a­bly fo­cus on sim­ple fund-based in­vest­ment port­fo­lios where I can rely on the skills of as­set man­agers to in­vest in funds in ac­cor­dance with their ex­pe­ri­ence and knowl­edge.</p>
    <p>Q De­scribe your in­vest­ing strat­egy.</p>
    <p>A I am gen­er­ally pas­sive when it comes to in­vest­ing, but in build­ing a new business, I have had to in­vest in and bet on my­self.</p>
    <p>Chan­nelling my sav­ings and ef­forts into Singlife has given me the most con­trol of its out­come.</p>
    <p>If I can­not in­flu­ence the out­come through my ef­forts, I’ll out­source it to some­one who can do it bet­ter than me.</p>
    <p>In terms of insurance cov­er­age, I have an old univer­sal life pol­icy, two term life insurance poli­cies and some crit­i­cal ill­ness cover.</p>
    <p>I also buy a small cov­er­age from ev­ery pol­icy that Singlife has ever made, since the best way to know if your com­pany is suc­cess­ful is to be its cus­tomer and to test ev­ery­thing.</p>
    <p>Q What else is in your fi­nan­cial plan?</p>
    <p>A I’m a firm believer in legacy plan­ning – I’m an insurance guy after all. I have a will and a last­ing power of at­tor­ney to make sure that my fam­ily is well pro­tected and well pro­vided for.</p>
    <p>It al­ways amazes me how many peo­ple don’t have these sim­ple things in place.</p>
    <p>I don’t plan separately for my chil­dren or de­fine spe­cific fi­nan­cial goals to save for. I just bun­dle my sav­ings to­gether and make sure I don’t over­spend ev­ery month so that the pot gets big­ger as time goes by. It’s not much of a plan, but it works for me.</p>
    <p>Ad­di­tion­ally, I don’t be­lieve in trusts or as­set hold­ing struc­tures be­cause they are of­ten re­ally ex­pen­sive and they don’t give as much value as they used to.</p>
    <p>Q How are you plan­ning for re­tire­ment?</p>
    <p>A I don’t be­lieve I’d ever fully re­tire. My hope for the fu­ture is to stay ac­tive and look for ways to be in­volved, and hope­fully add some value to other or­gan­i­sa­tions based on my ex­pe­ri­ence.</p>
    <p>Once my chil­dren have grown up and moved out, I don’t sup­pose I need much to main­tain the cur­rent life­style my wife and I en­joy.</p>
    <p>Of course, I’d love to aim for three to four hol­i­days a year, eat nice food in restau­rants and spend time with friends and fam­ily. I guess with my mort­gage paid off and zero debt by then, a life like that would cost around $200,000 a year, but I’m sure it can be done with way less than that.</p>
    <p>NO OVERSPENDI­NG</p>
    <p>I don’t plan separately for my chil­dren or de­fine spe­cific fi­nan­cial goals to save for. I just bun­dle my sav­ings to­gether and make sure I don’t over­spend ev­ery month so that the pot gets big­ger as time goes by. It’s not much of a plan, but it works for me.</p>
    <p>Q What does money mean to you?</p>
    <p>A Money is just some ev­i­dence of achiev­ing per­sonal suc­cess. But other than that, money is like air – ev­ery­one needs it to live, and you don’t need more than what can go into your lungs.</p>
    <p>Q Home is now... A</p>
    <p>I have been liv­ing in Sin­ga­pore since 2000 and I in­tend to live here for the rest of my life.</p>
    <p>My fam­ily and I live in a four-bed­room, 2,400 sq ft apart­ment in the Bukit Timah area. It’s a lease­hold prop­erty which we bought in 2011.</p>
    <p>Q I drive... A</p>
    <p>A black 2005 As­ton Martin DB9. I some­times ride my Ether elec­tric skate­board – it’s an easy way to get around town and a nice al­ter­na­tive to have.</p>
