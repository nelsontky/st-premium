    <p>Two chil­dren of a wealthy wi­dow, who each re­ceived a smaller in­her­i­tance than their three sib­lings, chal­lenged the va­lid­ity of her will, al­leg­ing that their mother’s bipo­lar dis­or­der had af­fected her men­tal ca­pac­ity to make a will.</p>
    <p>The mother of five, who went from be­ing one of a busi­ness­man’s four mis­tresses to the ma­tri­arch of the fam­ily, died in Novem­ber 2016, a few days be­fore her 81st birth­day.</p>
    <p>In her May 2002 will, she gave her el­dest son, sec­ond son and youngest son one share each of her es­tate, while her only daugh­ter re­ceived a half share.</p>
    <p>Her third son, a father of three who did not hold a job for most of his adult life, got just $10,000.</p>
    <p>In a writ­ten judg­ment on Tues­day, the High Court held that the will was valid, rul­ing in favour of the woman’s el­dest and sec­ond sons, the ex­ecu­tors of the will who were sued by their two sib­lings.</p>
    <p>Ju­di­cial Com­mis­sioner Tan Puay Boon found that the woman’s bipo­lar dis­or­der was in re­mis­sion at the time, re­ject­ing the claim of the third son and daugh­ter that she lacked tes­ta­men­tary ca­pac­ity.</p>
    <p>The judge also re­jected their claim that their mother made the will un­der the “un­due in­flu­ence” of their el­dest and sec­ond brothers. The ev­i­dence showed she “ex­er­cised a sub­stan­tial de­gree of free will and in­de­pen­dence in her daily af­fairs” at the time, he said.</p>
    <p>The woman, a Can­tonese-speak­ing for­mer lounge host­ess, left a sub­stan­tial es­tate which in­cluded a 856.9 sq m fam­ily prop­erty in Tan­jong Ka­tong worth more than $10 mil­lion.</p>
    <p>If the will had been found in­valid and her es­tate di­vided equally among the five sib­lings, the three favoured sons would each get sev­eral mil­lion dol­lars less.</p>
    <p>The woman also pro­vided for her hus­band’s chil­dren from his first mar­riage, leav­ing his bi­o­log­i­cal son $10,000 and two adopted chil­dren $5,000 each.</p>
    <p>In a 123-page judg­ment, the judge delved into her re­la­tion­ship with each fam­ily mem­ber, the events sur­round­ing the mak­ing of the will, her med­i­cal his­tory and the ex­pert opin­ion of four psy­chi­a­trists.</p>
    <p>The doc­u­ment did not dis­close the names of the fam­ily mem­bers, who were in­stead as­signed pseu­do­nyms.</p>
    <p>The woman, who was made to work at night clubs since she was a teenager, be­came the third mis­tress of a man de­scribed as a wom­an­iser. She had five chil­dren with him and af­ter his first wife died, he mar­ried her.</p>
    <p>She was first di­ag­nosed with bipo­lar dis­or­der in 1978 and in 1997, was found at the fam­ily home wield­ing a knife and scream­ing for no rea­son.</p>
    <p>Over the years, she was treated for her men­tal ill­ness on mul­ti­ple oc­ca­sions.</p>
    <p>Af­ter her hus­band died in Jan­uary 2002, she told her lawyer to draft a let­ter to evict her third son Derek from the fam­ily home. She also told the lawyer to draft a will.</p>
    <p>In April 2003, she went into a coma from an over­dose of lithium, which was pre­scribed to treat her bipo­lar dis­or­der. She never fully re­cov­ered and lost her men­tal ca­pac­ity.</p>
    <p>In the judg­ment, the judge said the woman’s ra­tio­nale for giv­ing Derek only $10,000 was “log­i­cally ex­pli­ca­ble”, given their poor re­la­tion­ship.</p>
    <p>Derek, who lived in the fam­ily home with his wife and chil­dren, never had to get a job be­cause his father gave each son a sig­nif­i­cant share of the fam­ily com­pa­nies, with yearly div­i­dends amount­ing to about $100,000 to $200,000.</p>
    <p>Mul­ti­ple wit­nesses said the woman fre­quently com­plained about Derek’s un­em­ploy­ment and his re­fusal to move out.</p>
    <p>She was so bent on get­ting him to move out that she used a changkol, a dig­ging tool with a long han­dle, to smash the win­dows of his bed­room in 1999.</p>
    <p>The judge said it was also ex­pli­ca­ble that the woman gave her daugh­ter Ce­line less than what the other three sons each re­ceived, but more than what Derek re­ceived.</p>
    <p>He said there was suf­fi­cient ev­i­dence that the woman held con­ser­va­tive views on gen­der roles and sub­scribed to tra­di­tional val­ues of her gen­er­a­tion that favoured sons over daugh­ters.</p>
    <p>The judge noted that Ce­line’s de­ci­sion to marry a Cau­casian man up­set her mother, who threat­ened to disown her and re­fused to at­tend her wed­ding. Mother and daugh­ter even­tu­ally rec­on­ciled af­ter Ce­line gave birth to her first child.</p>
    <p>“What­ever legacy that chil­dren may ex­pect to re­ceive un­der the will of a par­ent who has passed on, it should be re­mem­bered that a tes­ta­tor has full au­ton­omy on how to dis­pose of his es­tate,” said the judge.</p>
    <p>“A par­ent is en­ti­tled to have favourite chil­dren and least­favoured chil­dren, in ac­cor­dance to his or her sub­jec­tive pref­er­ences.”</p>
    <p>Un­less it can be shown that the will is in­valid ow­ing to a lack of tes­ta­men­tary ca­pac­ity, un­due in­flu­ence or some other rea­son, the par­ent’s wishes have to re­spected and fol­lowed, said the judge.</p>
