        World | The Sunday Times Sunday, July 26, 2020 | A22 Farmers who pooled land to build Amaravati continue protests against its cancellati­on US, Russia to hold first space security talks since 2013 EXPLAIN BEHAVIOUR Your requests to foreign countries to make legislatio­n to sanction the Hong Kong government is in fact pressuring the government with the help of foreign powers... How would such behaviour concur with what you declared in your nomination statement to ‘uphold the Basic Law and to pledge allegiance to the Hong Kong Special Administra­tive Region’. • The United States and Russia will next week conduct their first formal bilateral talks on space security since 2013, following an American allegation that Russia had tested a space-based antisatell­ite weapon this month, a US official has said.
Washington hopes to promote norms of responsibl­e behaviour in outer space, said Mr Christophe­r Ford, the US Assistant Secretary of State for Internatio­nal Security and Nonprolife­ration, calling for greater stability, predictabi­lity and crisis management tools.
A State Department spokesman said the talks would take place tomorrow in Vienna.
Mr Ford told reporters on Friday that the US believes Russia and China have already turned space into “a war-fighting domain”, noting the US Space Command has said it has evidence that Russia tested a space-based anti-satellite weapon on July 15.
“What they’re doing is signalling to the world that they are able to destroy satellites in orbit with other satellites, it would appear. That is a very disturbing, provocativ­e, dangerous and ill-advised thing for them to be doing,” Mr Ford said.
“We hope that we can convey that message to them and work on a better way for countries to show appropriat­e restraint and responsibl­e behaviour in orbit, because this is the sort of thing that could get out of hand and go very badly rather quickly in the future,” he added.
He declined to name the person who will lead the US team or to ad- dress whether US and Russian officials next week might discuss a possible replacemen­t for the 2010 New Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (New Start), which caps US and Russian-deployed strategic nuclear weapons warheads at 1,550 each.
US special presidenti­al envoy for arms control Marshall Billingsle­a had told reporters after June 22 arms control talks with Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov in Vienna that further talks are possible late this month or early next.
