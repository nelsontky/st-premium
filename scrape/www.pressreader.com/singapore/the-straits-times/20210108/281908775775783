    <p>Uni­ver­si­ties can no longer op­er­ate like a fac­tory, churn­ing out grad­u­ates, just in time, to in­dus­try spec­i­fi­ca­tions, as quickly and as cheaply as they can.</p>
    <p>Vis­i­tors to the Na­tional Univer­sity of Sin­ga­pore’s Univer­sity Hall may have seen a quote from the great phi­lan­thropist and for­mer vice-chan­cel­lor Lee Kong Chian in the lift lobby. It reads:</p>
    <p>“A univer­sity is not just an ob­ject of pride and pres­tige, nor only an in­stru­ment for ac­quir­ing knowl­edge, but also a home in which the hu­man spirit can find free­dom, and draw in­spi­ra­tion.”</p>
    <p>Stu­dents come to the univer­sity for many dif­fer­ent rea­sons – to ac­quire knowl­edge and skills to pre­pare for work, to ex­plore their in­ter­est and pas­sion in dif­fer­ent ar­eas and sub­jects, or sim­ply to find them­selves. Very of­ten, and in­creas­ingly, for all three rea­sons.</p>
    <p>As a univer­sity, we see our­selves as more than just a bridge to the world of work – we strive to in­spire stu­dents to learn, and pro­vide the en­vi­ron­ment for our stu­dents to re­alise their po­ten­tial.</p>
    <p>To­day, more than ever be­fore, stu­dents must be taught to make con­nec­tions that cut across bound­aries, such as those carved out ar­ti­fi­cially for rea­sons of ad­min­is­tra­tive ef­fi­ciency and dis­ci­plinary pol­i­tics – between the arts and the sciences, and between the tech­ni­cal and the hu­man.</p>
    <p>Hence, we de­cided to strengthen broad-based, in­ter­dis­ci­pli­nary ed­u­ca­tion with the open­ing of our new Col­lege of Hu­man­i­ties and Sciences.</p>
    <p>Launched last month, the new col­lege draws on the ex­per­tise of two of its old­est fac­ul­ties – arts and so­cial sciences, and sci­ence – and will take in more than 2,000 un­der­grad­u­ates. The col­lege, which will ad­mit its first co­hort in Au­gust this year, marks a ma­jor shift from the tra­di­tional way of learn­ing in sep­a­rate dis­ci­plines.</p>
    <p>TEACH LESS, LEARN MORE</p>
    <p>In my 30-plus years as an ed­u­ca­tor, I have learnt a few things about learn­ing. It can be done pas­sively or ac­tively, through spe­cific in­struc­tion, or as a happy but un­in­tended con­se­quence.</p>
    <p>It can be done in a class­room, lab­o­ra­tory, over a lunch dis­cus­sion, or ex­pe­ri­en­tially. In the field of learn­ing sci­ence, schol­ars have pro­posed the­o­ries and de­bated learn­ing meth­ods for over 70 years.</p>
    <p>In 2005, the Min­istry of Ed­u­ca­tion’s “Teach Less, Learn More” ini­tia­tive sig­nalled a philo­soph­i­cal shift, where cur­ricu­lum was re­duced to cre­ate space for cre­ativ­ity, crit­i­cal think­ing and a love for learn­ing.</p>
    <p>It is al­ways a del­i­cate bal­ance to de­cide how much is enough. Sin­ga­pore’s per­for­mance in the Trends in In­ter­na­tional Math­e­mat­ics and Sci­ence Study and the Pro­gramme for In­ter­na­tional Stu­dent As­sess­ment has al­ways been ex­cep­tional and the envy of many other na­tions.</p>
    <p>This sug­gests that we are do­ing some things right. But there has also been a nag­ging con­cern that we might still be teach­ing too much. I be­lieve that there is still room to im­prove our cal­i­bra­tion.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore is an ef­fi­cient so­ci­ety, and we are con­di­tioned to hurry and meet key per­for­mance in­di­ca­tors. Teach­ers are un­der pres­sure to com­plete the syl­labus and stu­dents are ex­pected to learn everything by the exam date. This is com­pounded by the rapid changes in the world that seem to re­quire stu­dents to learn ever faster.</p>
    <p>LEARN­ING IS NOT LIN­EAR</p>
    <p>The au­then­tic ac­qui­si­tion of knowl­edge is a com­plex process of ex­plo­ration, and of­ten fail­ure. Learn­ing is not a sim­ple lin­ear pro­gres­sion (par­don the pun by a math­e­ma­ti­cian).</p>
    <p>It is messy and of­ten dou­bles back on it­self – it some­times leads to dead ends. But dead ends can lead to mo­ments of serendip­i­tous in­sights. Learn­ing sci­ence sug­gests that some me­an­der­ing ac­tu­ally im­proves learn­ing out­comes. For ex­am­ple, a 2000 US Na­tional Re­search Coun­cil re­port, How Peo­ple Learn, found that learn­ing is most ef­fec­tive when it oc­curs across var­ied and non-ad­ja­cent sit­u­a­tions. In a word: in­ter­dis­ci­pli­nary. Sub­se­quent re­search has also borne this out.</p>
    <p>Such learn­ing takes time and pa­tience – not just in pick­ing up the skills or con­tent, but in the mak­ing of mean­ing­ful con­nec­tions.</p>
    <p>Th­ese con­nec­tions can be across do­mains and top­ics, across space and time, and across chang­ing so­ci­etal per­cep­tions. But th­ese con­nec­tions are es­sen­tial to make the learn­ing per­sonal for an in­di­vid­ual.</p>
    <p>Oth­er­wise, there is no learn­ing, only the ac­cu­mu­la­tion of facts, which would be for­got­ten over time.</p>
    <p>At first glance, the idea of less teach­ing and more me­an­der­ing for more learn­ing might sound counter-in­tu­itive.</p>
    <p>Af­ter all, all grad­u­ates must find work when they grad­u­ate. They need to show em­ploy­ers that they can code, model in Excel, or write a pro­posal, and so on. To dab­ble in this and that – and not to hone spe­cific skills to land that first job – can be seen as in­dul­gent.</p>
    <p>Noth­ing could be fur­ther from the truth: We be­lieve that the free­dom to ex­plore is in fact nec­es­sary to en­hance our stu­dents’ ca­pac­ity to learn.</p>
    <p>Our grad­u­ates will need to me­an­der and ar­rive, learn and un­learn, as knowl­edge de­cays faster. We are not pre­par­ing our stu­dents for their first job. We are pre­par­ing them for many jobs in their 40 to 50 years of work­ing ca­reer – we want them to be life­long learn­ers.</p>

    <p>Uni­ver­si­ties should be about en­larg­ing op­por­tu­ni­ties and widen­ing hori­zons – not just to earn money, but also to learn to be hu­man – over a life­time.</p>
    <p>CU­RIOS­ITY IS VI­TAL</p>
    <p>In 1968, sci­en­tist Ge­orge Land had 1,600 five-year-olds take a test that he de­vel­oped for Nasa to select cre­ative and in­no­va­tive sci­en­tists and en­gi­neers. Th­ese chil­dren re­peated the test when they were 10 and 15 years old.</p>
    <p>The per­cent­age who scored in the “highly cre­ative range” fell from 98 per cent to 30 per cent, to fi­nally 2 per cent. Dr Land ex­plained: “What we have con­cluded is that non-cre­ative be­hav­iour is learnt.”</p>
    <p>Cre­ativ­ity is driven by cu­rios­ity. So is learn­ing. Dr Land’s ex­per­i­ment sug­gests that the for­mal school sys­tem may have caused chil­dren to lose their in­nate cu­rios­ity.</p>
    <p>This is tragic. We hope to ad­dress this, in part, by pro­mot­ing in­ter­dis­ci­pli­nary learn­ing, and es­pe­cially, through our new col­lege.</p>
    <p>FO­CUS ON HOW STU­DENTS LEARN</p>
    <p>There are two parts to what we want stu­dents to learn – knowl­edge, and the think­ing skills to in­te­grate and ap­ply knowl­edge.</p>
    <p>The trans­mis­sion of knowl­edge is well un­der­stood and eas­ily done. The lat­ter is much more chal­leng­ing an en­deav­our.</p>
    <p>The types of skills that we want our stu­dents to learn – cre­ativ­ity, crit­i­cal think­ing and analysis, and so on – can­not eas­ily be taught us­ing tra­di­tional meth­ods.</p>
    <p>Our fo­cus should there­fore be on un­der­stand­ing how our stu­dents learn. We need to re­think the why, what and how of teach­ing and learn­ing, es­pe­cially since stu­dents to­day are very dif­fer­ent from when their par­ents were stu­dents.</p>
    <p>We need to con­sider more deeply the mo­ti­va­tions and in­cli­na­tions of stu­dents, to light fires of cu­rios­ity and ex­cite­ment.</p>
    <p>We need to show them why and what they are learn­ing in school is rel­e­vant. We need to en­gage them cog­ni­tively and emo­tively.</p>
    <p>We have long known that just con­vey­ing knowl­edge is in­suf­fi­cient.</p>
    <p>Stud­ies have shown that ac­tive modes of learn­ing – such as group dis­cus­sions, ex­pe­ri­en­tial learn­ing and teach­ing oth­ers – have longer re­ten­tion on av­er­age. Re­ten­tion of knowl­edge is only the first step to learn­ing. To learn deeply and for long-term re­ten­tion, we need our stu­dents to en­gage in the ac­tive modes of learn­ing.</p>
    <p>END­ING THE CHURN</p>
    <p>Ad­vances in tech­nol­ogy will cre­ate many op­por­tu­ni­ties. Dig­i­tal skills will be in great de­mand in the fore­see­able fu­ture.</p>
    <p>In such a world, we can­not hope to beat com­put­ers in what they do, and it would be fool­ish to try. This means that our stu­dents should fo­cus on hu­man-cen­tric skills.</p>
    <p>The univer­sity can no longer op­er­ate like a fac­tory. Our fo­cus can­not be on churn­ing out grad­u­ates, just in time, to in­dus­try spec­i­fi­ca­tions, as quickly and as cheaply as we can.</p>
    <p>We want to fo­cus on pre­par­ing our stu­dents, not just for the fu­ture of work, but for a fu­ture that we can­not to­day fore­see or pre­dict.</p>
    <p>In fact, to view train­ing as a cog in the ma­chine as we move into In­dus­try 4.0 – char­ac­terised by ac­cel­er­ated change and job au­to­ma­tion – may be our un­do­ing. The traits of cu­rios­ity, cre­ativ­ity and con­nect­ing the dots, as well as un­der­stand­ing one­self in so­ci­ety, will help peo­ple learn to be hu­man, as well as earn a living.</p>
    <p>Fo­cus­ing not so much on out­comes, but on the process, will en­hance our stu­dents’ ca­pac­ity to learn.</p>
    <p>Uni­ver­si­ties should be about en­larg­ing op­por­tu­ni­ties and widen­ing hori­zons – not just to earn money, but also to learn to be hu­man – over a life­time.</p>
