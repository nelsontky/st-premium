    <p>PARIS • The French au­thor­i­ties have told tele­coms op­er­a­tors plan­ning to buy Huawei 5G equip­ment that they will not be able to re­new li­cences for the gear once they ex­pire, ef­fec­tively phas­ing the Chi­nese firm out of mo­bile net­works, sources close to the mat­ter said.</p>
    <p>France is lay­ing the ground for its 5G mo­bile mar­ket in the mid­dle of a grow­ing geopo­lit­i­cal storm be­tween two global su­per­pow­ers. The United States says Huawei’s equip­ment could be used by the Chi­nese gov­ern­ment for es­pi­onage – a charge both Bei­jing and Huawei have de­nied – and has pressed its al­lies to ban it.</p>
    <p>France’s cy­ber se­cu­rity agency ANSSI said this month it would al­low op­er­a­tors to use equip­ment, in­clud­ing Huawei’s, un­der li­cences of three to eight years, but urged tel­cos not cur­rently us­ing Huawei gear to avoid it. Op­er­a­tors must each ap­ply for dozens of li­cences for equip­ment to cover dif­fer­ent parts of the coun­try.</p>
    <p>The sources said the bulk of au­tho­ri­sa­tions for Huawei gear were for three or five years, while most of those for gear from Euro­pean ri­vals Eric­s­son or Nokia got eightyear li­cences.</p>
    <p>The sources said op­er­a­tors had also been told by French au­thor­i­ties, not stated for­mally in doc­u­ments, that li­cences granted for Huawei gear will not be re­newed. ANSSI de­clined to com­ment.</p>
    <p>The re­stric­tions amount to a de facto phas­ing out of Huawei within France’s 5G net­works by 2028, given the li­cences’ short time­frame, ac­cord­ing to the sources who de­clined to be named.</p>
    <p>In Bri­tain, where ma­jor tele­coms groups are heav­ily re­liant on Huawei tech­nol­ogy, the gov­ern­ment has or­dered the Chi­nese firm’s equip­ment to be purged from the 5G net­work by 2027.</p>
    <p>“France’s po­si­tion is sim­i­lar to that of Bri­tain, but the gov­ern­ment’s com­mu­ni­ca­tion is dif­fer­ent,” one of the sources said. “Huawei can’t do much about it.”</p>
