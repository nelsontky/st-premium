    <p>The beaches i n Sin­ga­pore are cleaned twice a day dur­ing the north-east and south-west mon­soon pe­ri­ods when more rub­bish is brought to the shore and de­bris in­creases, said Min­is­ter for Sus­tain­abil­ity and the En­vi­ron­ment Grace Fu yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>For the other half of the year, the beaches are cleaned four times a week or up to once a day, she added in Par­lia­ment.</p>
    <p>The com­ments came amid con­cerns that the prob­lem of marine trash could be wors­en­ing in some coun­tries dur­ing the Covid-19 cri­sis, with a surge in the use and im­proper dis­posal of plas­tics and waste.</p>
    <p>Ms Na­dia Ah­mad Samdin (Ang Mo Kio GRC) asked how marine trash on Sin­ga­pore’s coasts is tack­led, beyond beach clean-ups, as well as what the de­bris typ­i­cally con­sists of.</p>
    <p>Ms Fu said: “The bulk of our beach lit­ter is marine de­bris brought in by nat­u­ral tidal con­di­tions.</p>
    <p>“The most com­mon de­bris are sty­ro­foam, film and hard plas­tic frag­ments.</p>
    <p>“We can all do our part to keep our beaches clean. This in­cludes demon­strat­ing so­cial re­spon­si­bil­ity by not lit­ter­ing, as well as sup­port­ing beach clean-ups, es­pe­cially dur­ing the mon­soon pe­ri­ods.”</p>
    <p>Pho­tos of plas­tic items, such as cups and bot­tles, and sty­ro­foam con­tain­ers strewn on some of the beaches here emerged in Au­gust, prompt­ing ques­tions from the pub­lic about why the trash sit­u­a­tion looked worse than usual.</p>
    <p>At least one vol­un­teer group, Best East Coast Cleanup Plan, or­gan­ised through mes­sag­ing ap­pli­ca­tion Tele­gram and which now has more than 2,700 peo­ple in it, has been set up in a com­mu­nity ef­fort to main­tain Sin­ga­pore’s beaches.</p>
    <p>The group, started by Ms Sa­man­tha Thian, founder of so­cial en­ter­prise Seas­t­ain­able, has helped to pick up more than 12 tonnes of rub­bish since July.</p>
    <p>The Na­tional Parks Board and Na­tional En­vi­ron­ment Agency pre­vi­ously said that de­spite more peo­ple vis­it­ing Sin­ga­pore’s beaches since June, the higher amount of trash – up to a 90 per cent in­crease at East Coast Park dur­ing the mon­soon months com­pared with other times of the year – is mostly de­bris from the im­me­di­ate re­gion brought in by winds and tides.</p>
    <p>Most vis­i­tors con­tinue to prac­tise good park eti­quette and throw their lit­ter in des­ig­nated bins, they added.</p>
