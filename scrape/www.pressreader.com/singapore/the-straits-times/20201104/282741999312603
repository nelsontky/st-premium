    <p>When I start ped­alling, I for­get about the pres­sures of work and daily life. I am forced to slow down my pace and pay at­ten­tion to the ride and view around me.</p>
    <p>Even a slow ride can be ex­hil­a­rat­ing when I am jaded; and when I pick up speed on empty tracks at night and feel the wind in my face, the ride be­comes a joy­ful rush.</p>
    <p>Two months be­fore I climbed Mount Kin­a­balu in Sabah last De­cem­ber, I did three things to train – walk or run up the stairs in tall hous­ing blocks, hike in na­ture parks, or cy­cle ev­ery week.</p>
    <p>Cy­cling works many of the same leg mus­cles that we use for climb­ing, such as the calves, ham­strings and quadri­ceps.</p>
    <p>I stopped cy­cling after I con­quered the 4,095m sum­mit.</p>
    <p>How­ever, since the Covid-19 pan­demic be­gan, I have found my­self back on the sad­dle, go­ing cy­cling at least once ev­ery fort­night.</p>
    <p>It is my go-to ac­tiv­ity for fresh air, and the best part is, I don’t need to wear a mask while do­ing so. It is a great rea­son to get out of the house, es­pe­cially as I have been work­ing from home since Fe­bru­ary.</p>
    <p>I am not enough of an avid cy­clist to get my own wheels. I get my two-wheeler at bike rental shops at East Coast Park or The Pung­gol Set­tle­ment in­stead. I cy­cle for up to three hours in one ride, clock­ing 50 to 60km.</p>
    <p>The first time I cy­cled on Coney Is­land in Pung­gol, I thought: “This is un­like any route in Sin­ga­pore.”</p>
    <p>Much of the trail there is made</p>
    <p>up of sand, stones and gravel, which can make for a slightly bumpy ride.</p>
    <p>The 2.5km Coney Is­land trail is also much shorter than other cy­cling trails, but you can make up for the lack of dis­tance by in­clud­ing Pung­gol Wa­ter­way Park in your ex­pe­di­tion.</p>
    <p>When I am in the mood to cy­cle on more sturdy ground, visit the beach or bask in the view of the city sky­line, I make a round trip from East Coast Park to Ma­rina Bar­rage.</p>
    <p>It is a pop­u­lar route and in­cor­po­rates all the el­e­ments I like</p>
    <p>– the beach, a sea breeze and spec­tac­u­lar views of the sky­line un­der Ben­jamin Sheares Bridge.</p>
    <p>I usu­ally stop by Satay By The</p>
    <p>Bay for a re­fresh­ing sug­ar­cane juice with sour plum be­fore head­ing back to East Coast Park.</p>
    <p>Apart from reap­ing health ben­e­fits such as im­proved joint mo­bil­ity, I en­joy what is com­monly known as a run­ner’s high – the feel­ing of ela­tion, re­duced stress and a de­creased abil­ity to feel pain due to high lev­els of en­dor­phins re­leased by ex­er­cise.</p>
    <p>There are many other scenic routes I want to ex­plore this year, in­clud­ing the 36km Coast-to-Coast trail from Jurong Lake Gar­dens to Coney Is­land. The route cuts across the coun­try via park con­nec­tors, na­ture parks and hous­ing es­tates.</p>
    <p>Cy­cling dur­ing the pan­demic has made me en­joy the coun­try in a way I never thought pos­si­ble.</p>
    <p>Many of the rides I took right after the cir­cuit breaker – when it was still quiet on the streets – pro­vided me with the sur­real feel­ing of see­ing the coun­try I have lived in for 28 years in a new light.</p>
    <p>It has also changed the way in which I will ex­plore other coun­tries in the fu­ture.</p>
    <p>I have been a firm be­liever in the say­ing, “The best way to ex­plore a city is on foot.” I have walked the most in coun­tries I was un­fa­mil­iar with, such as Is­rael, Turkey and Kaza­khstan.</p>
    <p>But next time, I think I will ex­plore on two wheels in­stead.</p>
