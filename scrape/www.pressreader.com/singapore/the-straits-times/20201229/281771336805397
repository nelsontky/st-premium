    <p>When Mr Todd Lemons first re­ceived the In­done­sian gov­ern­ment’s green light to help set up the 64,000ha Rimba Raya re­serve in Cen­tral Kal­i­man­tan in 2010, a car­bon credit would fetch US$10 (S$13) a tonne.</p>
    <p>Three years later, after a long tus­sle with a palm oil com­pany that wanted the land, de­mand for car­bon cred­its had col­lapsed to about US$3 a tonne as in­vestors shied away and a long-promised manda­tory, or for­mal, car­bon trad­ing market failed to ma­te­ri­alise.</p>
    <p>The re­serve – a US$5 mil­lion in­vest­ment to pre­serve a trop­i­cal peat swamp for­est that cov­ers an area nearly the size of Sin­ga­pore – locks away as much car­bon diox­ide as nearly five coal-fired power plants can pro­duce in a year.</p>
    <p>Projects like Rimba Raya store huge amounts of car­bon in the trees and deep peat. If cleared and drained, the project would re­lease mil­lions of tonnes of car­bon diox­ide and other green­house gases. Pre­serv­ing them is a key weapon in fight­ing climate change.</p>
    <p>To help pay the costs of manag­ing the project and fund­ing lo­cal liveli­hood projects, clients agree to buy car­bon cred­its from the project, each rep­re­sent­ing a tonne of avoided car­bon emis­sions. The cus­tomer is es­sen­tially pay­ing to keep the car­bon in place.</p>
    <p>Rimba Raya says its project is the largest in terms of avoided emis­sions de­liv­ered to date – more than 130 mil­lion tonnes of car­bon emis­sions. For now, sales of car­bon off­set trans­ac­tions from Rimba Raya and other off­set projects, such as ef­fi­cient house­hold cook stoves, oc­cur in the vol­un­tary car­bon market, where firms buy car­bon off­sets as part of their green ef­forts.</p>
    <p>The off­sets are not valid for use in na­tional, manda­tory car­bon mar­kets, like the Euro­pean Emis­sions Trad­ing Scheme which cov­ers Europe’s in­dus­try and sets in­creas­ing emis­sions re­duc­tion tar­gets for big pol­luters. The de­sign of the scheme is quite dif­fer­ent.</p>
    <p>While Rimba Raya earns enough to cover its costs and pay for a float­ing clinic that serves the seven vil­lages that dot the river ad­join­ing the con­ces­sion, it has not paid a return to its in­vestors.</p>
    <p>“We have in­vestors who are in­vest­ing for the right rea­sons,” said Mr Lemons, chief ex­ec­u­tive of­fi­cer of Hong Kong-based In­finiteEart­h, which man­ages the project. “They are ex­pect­ing a return at some point.”</p>
    <p>But a study pub­lished last week might give the in­vestors cause for op­ti­mism. Writ­ten by Con­ser­va­tion In­ter­na­tional, DBS Bank, Na­tional Univer­sity of Sin­ga­pore and Te­masek, the re­port says car­bon projects in South-east Asia like Rimba Raya can po­ten­tially gen­er­ate re­turns on in­vest­ment of up to US$27.5 bil­lion per year.</p>
    <p>With roughly 15 per cent of the world’s trop­i­cal forests, which are in­creas­ingly un­der threat, South­east Asia’s car­bon stores of­fer the world’s high­est rate of return, the re­port says.</p>
    <p>This is based on a com­bi­na­tion of the size of the car­bon stores – the re­gion’s trop­i­cal forests store bil­lions of tonnes of car­bon – and the risks they face from de­for­esta­tion for their tim­ber and agri­cul­ture.</p>
    <p>That makes the re­main­ing in­tact, high-qual­ity car­bon even more valu­able. For in­stance, be­tween 1990 and this year, South-east Asia lost 376,000 sq km of forests or roughly one-sixth of its for­mer ex­panse. In­done­sia and Cam­bo­dia are the worst af­fected, ac­cord­ing to the United Na­tions Food and Agri­cul­ture Or­gan­i­sa­tion.</p>
    <p>But even as car­bon emis­sions shrink this year amid the Covid-19 pan­demic which has tipped most economies into re­ces­sion, high­pro­file prom­ises to curb car­bon emis­sions sug­gest a last­ing re­cov­ery in the car­bon market might at last be at hand.</p>
    <p>In Jan­uary, Mi­crosoft said it plans to re­move more car­bon from the at­mos­phere than it puts there by the end of the decade, bet­ter­ing a vow a year ear­lier by Ama­zon to be car­bon neu­tral by 2040.</p>
    <p>Ear­lier this month, for­mer Bank of Eng­land gover­nor Mark Car­ney said he would help es­tab­lish a global car­bon off­set market. A pilot pro­gramme ought to be up and run­ning next year.</p>
    <p>A car­bon ex­change could go some way to­wards in­ject­ing more trans­parency into a market that gets crit­i­cised for be­ing opaque with high op­er­at­ing costs.</p>
    <p>In Sin­ga­pore, the AirCar­bon Ex­change aims to bring much needed trans­parency to the market by trad­ing car­bon off­sets like any other com­mod­ity. Fully ver­i­fied off­sets are held in a reg­istry and are traded by the tonne of car­bon in a trans­par­ent man­ner on the dig­i­tal ex­change be­tween buyer and seller.</p>
    <p>Al­though it is early days yet, the ex­change al­ready has a grow­ing client base, from car­bon project de­vel­op­ers to in­vest­ment funds.</p>
    <p>In the vol­un­tary market, car­bon cred­its – gen­er­ated ac­cord­ing to rules set down by non-prof­its like Washington-based Verra – are, for now, mainly sold di­rectly to clients, mak­ing it tough to keep tabs on what is a fair price.</p>
    <p>Cal­cu­lat­ing those cred­its is ex­pen­sive. Mr Lemons said reg­u­lar au­dits of the Rimba Raya project take months and cost roughly US$250,000. The au­dits are meant to en­sure car­bon off­set projects are lock­ing away sig­nif­i­cant lev­els of car­bon based on the strict method­olo­gies set by Verra and other recog­nised stan­dards.</p>
    <p>While over­all sales of car­bon cred­its more than dou­bled to US$320 mil­lion last year from a year ear­lier, said climate non­profit For­est Trends, that is only half of where the market was a decade ago.</p>
    <p>Pro­fes­sor Koh Lian Pin, direc­tor of the Na­tional Univer­sity of Sin­ga­pore’s Cen­tre for Na­ture-based Climate So­lu­tions and one of the au­thors of the re­port, said the de­pressed market might in­di­cate in­vestors’ wari­ness.</p>
    <p>The re­port, the first to fo­cus on South-east Asia, as­sumes a more mod­est price for car­bon of less than US$6 a tonne – even as more buy­ers prom­ise to pile into the market – and takes into ac­count the reg­u­la­tory and fi­nan­cial hur­dles of set­ting up car­bon projects, he said.</p>
    <p>“Fif­teen years ago, this thing was hyped,” Prof Koh said, re­fer­ring to car­bon trad­ing. “There’s less hype now and more fo­cus on the science and pol­icy as­pects.”</p>
    <p>Mr Lemons said that by 2022, Rimba Raya ought to fi­nally find as many buy­ers for its car­bon cred­its as it is per­mit­ted to sell – some­thing that has not hap­pened yet.</p>
    <p>As firms be­come con­cerned with mit­i­gat­ing the risks that climate change poses to their op­er­a­tions, con­di­tions for the car­bon market will im­prove, Mr Lemons said.</p>
