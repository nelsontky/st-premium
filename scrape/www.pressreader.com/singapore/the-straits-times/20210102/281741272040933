    <p>• Bri­tish Prime Min­is­ter Boris John­son’s fa­ther Stan­ley has confirmed plans to seek French cit­i­zen­ship as the free move­ment of Bri­tons in the Euro­pean Union comes to an end un­der the Brexit pact de­liv­ered by his son.</p>
    <p>The older Mr John­son told France’s RTL ra­dio on Thurs­day: “It’s not a ques­tion of be­com­ing French. If I un­der­stand cor­rectly, I am French! My mother was born in France, and her mother was com­pletely French, as was her grand­fa­ther.”</p>
    <p>Speak­ing in French, the 80-year-old added: “For me, it’s a ques­tion of ob­tain­ing what I al­ready have and I am very happy about that.”</p>
    <p>The fa­ther of the politi­cian who ended Bri­tain’s 47-year-old mem­ber­ship of the EU was among the first civil ser­vants ap­pointed to Brus­sels af­ter Bri­tain joined the EU in 1973.</p>
    <p>He worked for the Euro­pean Com­mis­sion and served as a mem­ber of the Euro­pean Par­lia­ment.</p>
    <p>He ini­tially cam­paigned against leav­ing the EU be­fore chang­ing his mind a year af­ter Bri­tain voted to leave the union in 2016.</p>
    <p>“I will al­ways be Euro­pean, that’s for sure,” he told RTL, adding: “You can’t tell the English: you’re not Euro­pean. Europe is more than the sin­gle mar­ket, it’s more than the Euro­pean Union.”</p>
    <p>In an ap­par­ent ref­er­ence to an EU pass­port, he added: “That said, to have a link like that with the EU is im­por­tant.”</p>
    <p>His an­nounce­ment was not well re­ceived in some quar­ters of Bri­tish so­ci­ety.</p>
    <p>Mr Chris Ren­nard, a Lib­eral Democrat mem­ber of the House of Lords, said Mr Stan­ley John­son de­served the “brass neck of the year award... for be­ing able to pre­serve his per­sonal ben­e­fits of EU cit­i­zen­ship through a French pass­port ap­pli­ca­tion”.</p>
    <p>“This is some­thing which his son Boris is deny­ing from tonight to 67 mil­lion UK cit­i­zens.”</p>
