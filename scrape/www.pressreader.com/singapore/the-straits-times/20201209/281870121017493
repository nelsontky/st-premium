    <p>CANBERRA Aus­tralian Prime Min­is­ter Scott Mor­ri­son has new pow­ers to veto or scrap agree­ments that state govern­ments reach with for­eign pow­ers un­der laws that could stymie China’s Belt and Road Ini­tia­tive (BRI) in Aus­tralia and fur­ther in­flame ten­sions be­tween the trad­ing part­ners.</p>
    <p>The laws passed by Par­lia­ment yes­ter­day will give the for­eign min­is­ter the abil­ity to stop new and pre­vi­ously signed agree­ments be­tween over­seas govern­ments and Aus­tralia’s eight states and ter­ri­to­ries, and with bod­ies such as the lo­cal au­thor­i­ties and uni­ver­si­ties.</p>
    <p>Mr Mor­ri­son’s gov­ern­ment will be able to block or cur­tail for­eign in­volve­ment in a broad range of sec­tors such as in­fra­struc­ture, trade co­op­er­a­tion, tourism, cul­tural col­lab­o­ra­tion, sci­ence, health and ed­u­ca­tion, in­clud­ing univer­sity re­search part­ner­ships.</p>
    <p>An early tar­get is likely to be an agree­ment the Vic­to­ria state gov­ern­ment signed in 2018 to join Chi­nese Pres­i­dent Xi Jin­ping’s sig­na­ture in­fra­struc­ture-build­ing BRI.</p>
    <p>The laws could fur­ther worsen ties be­tween Aus­tralia and its largest trad­ing part­ner, which have been in free fall since April, when Mr Mor­ri­son called for an in­de­pen­dent probe into the ori­gins of the coro­n­avirus.</p>
    <p>Bei­jing has since in­flicted a range of trade reprisals, in­clud­ing im­pos­ing crip­pling tar­iffs on Aus­tralian bar­ley and wine while block­ing coal ship­ments.</p>
    <p>Ties hit a fresh low last week when a Chi­nese diplo­mat tweeted an im­age pur­port­ing to show an Aus­tralian sol­dier hold­ing a knife to the throat of an Afghan child.</p>
    <p>After Mr Mor­ri­son called for an apol­ogy for the “re­pug­nant” post, a se­nior Chi­nese For­eign Min­istry of­fi­cial dis­missed the de­mand, ques­tion­ing whether the Aus­tralian leader “lacks a sense of right and wrong”.</p>
    <p>Vic­to­ria Premier Daniel An­drews told re­porters last week that his gov­ern­ment was not con­sid­er­ing with­draw­ing from its BRI deal due to the wors­en­ing ties, the Aus­tralian Associated Press re­ported.</p>
    <p>China’s co­op­er­a­tion with Vic­to­ria on BRI has brought ben­e­fits to both sides, Chi­nese For­eign Min­istry spokesman Zhao Li­jian said in Au­gust.</p>
    <p>“Aus­tralia should have an ob­jec­tive view of such co­op­er­a­tion and BRI, and not set up im­ped­i­ments for China-Aus­tralia co­op­er­a­tion.”</p>
    <p>Be­yond the BRI deal signed by Vic­to­ria, which aims to in­crease Chi­nese par­tic­i­pa­tion in new in­fra­struc­ture pro­jects, the law may al­low the fed­eral gov­ern­ment to re­view and over­turn mem­o­ran­dums of un­der­stand­ing be­tween Bei­jing and the govern­ments of Western Aus­tralia, South Aus­tralia and Tas­ma­nia in sec­tors rang­ing from in­vest­ment, sci­ence co­op­er­a­tion and ac­cess to the Antarc­tic.</p>
    <p>The states and ter­ri­to­ries have at least 130 agree­ments across 30 na­tions that could be af­fected by the new law, said Mr Mor­ri­son.</p>
    <p>The law will es­tab­lish a pub­lic reg­is­ter to pro­vide trans­parency over the for­eign min­is­ter’s de­ci­sions, and states and ter­ri­to­ries will have three months to de­liver a stock-take of their ex­ist­ing deals.</p>
    <p>Part­ner­ships be­tween Aus­tralian uni­ver­si­ties and Bei­jingspon­sored bod­ies could be scrapped.</p>
    <p>Un­der the law, Mr Mor­ri­son will not be able to scrap deals be­tween state govern­ments and com­mer­cial com­pa­nies or state-owned en­ter­prises. That means the lease of a strate­gic port in Dar­win, used by the United States mil­i­tary, to a Chi­nese com­pany by the North­ern Ter­ri­tory gov­ern­ment in 2015 could not be over­turned.</p>
    <p>Mr Mor­ri­son also plans to toughen for­eign in­vest­ment screen­ing, re­gard­less of the size of the deal, f or sec­tors such as telecom­mu­ni­ca­tions, en­ergy and tech­nol­ogy.</p>
