    <p>Al­most all the Na­tional Day Pa­rade (NDP) 2020 packs pro­duced for Sin­ga­porean and per­ma­nent res­i­dent (PR) house­holds were col­lected at com­mu­nity cen­tres or clubs and res­i­dents’ com­mit­tee cen­tres over the past two weeks.</p>
    <p>Close to 80 per cent of Sin­ga­porean and PR house­holds picked up more than 1.05 mil­lion packs, which was a “very strong re­sponse”, the NDP2020 ex­ec­u­tive com­mit­tee said yes­ter­day. Col­lec­tion of the packs ended on Sun­day.</p>
    <p>The com­mit­tee added that the re­main­ing packs will be dis­trib­uted to res­i­dents in homes and fa­cil­i­ties man­aged by both gov­ern­ment agen­cies and wel­fare groups.</p>
    <p>It was the first time that NDP packs were dis­trib­uted to Sin­ga­porean and PR house­holds in lieu of a cen­tralised pa­rade.</p>
    <p>In pre­vi­ous years, packs were given out only to those at­tend­ing the pa­rade, the pa­rade re­hearsals and those sup­port­ing the or­gan­i­sa­tion of the event. There had been calls, in­clud­ing an on­line pe­ti­tion, to al­low peo­ple to opt out of re­ceiv­ing the pack, cit­ing a bet­ter pos­si­ble use of the re­sources.</p>
    <p>Among those who did not pick up the NDP pack was re­tired hawker Tang Hock Siang, 78, who made his de­ci­sion af­ter look­ing at the packs that his friends had col­lected.</p>
    <p>“My wife and I have enough cloth and sur­gi­cal masks for our own use, and our chil­dren have given us a lot of re­us­able bags. It is a nice ges­ture from the or­gan­is­ers and the Gov­ern­ment. It is just that we wouldn’t use most of the items in it,” he said.</p>
    <p>“But some of my friends col­lected the packs be­cause of the face masks, and they said they were more com­fort­able than some of the other types of masks which were dis­trib­uted pre­vi­ously.”</p>
    <p>The Sin­ga­pore To­gether pack, which comes in the form of a tote bag, in­cluded items such as face masks, a ther­mome­ter and hand sani­tis­ers, in ad­di­tion to snacks and drinks.</p>
    <p>Ms De­siree Tan, 27, said that her fam­ily bal­lots for NDP tick­ets every year, and one of the high­lights for them is al­ways the pack.</p>
    <p>“It is not so much about what is in the pack be­cause there are things we don’t use, like the coupon book­lets, packet drinks or tem­po­rary tat­toos. But there have been some cre­ative bag de­signs which my mother likes to col­lect, and I thought this year’s tote bag was nice and prac­ti­cal,” she said.</p>
    <p>This year, the bags fea­ture 10 de­signs by as­pir­ing artists with dis­abil­i­ties from seven or­gan­i­sa­tions in col­lab­o­ra­tion with SG En­able, as well as 10 de­signs by Pri­mary 5 pupils in col­lab­o­ra­tion with the Min­istry of Ed­u­ca­tion.</p>
    <p>“I am glad that they have stream­lined the items in this year’s pack, but I wish there was an op­tion for us to do­nate some of the items we know we won’t use,” said Ms Tan, a sales man­ager for a tech­nol­ogy com­pany.</p>
    <p>She added that she was glad that left­over packs would be dis­trib­uted to res­i­dents in homes and fa­cil­i­ties, in what is “a good way to spread com­mu­nity spirit”.</p>
