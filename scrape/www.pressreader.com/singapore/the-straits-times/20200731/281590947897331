    <p>Covid-19 cases in Sin­ga­pore have surged past 50,000, but only 0.3 per cent have been ad­mit­ted to an in­ten­sive care unit (ICU) as of Mon­day. Ex­perts said years of in­vest­ment in health­care and a well-ex­e­cuted strat­egy to keep in­fec­tion num­bers low have helped to en­sure Sin­ga­pore has one of the world’s low­est ICU ad­mis­sion and fa­tal­ity rates.</p>
    <p>While Covid-19 cases in Sin­ga­pore have surged past 50,000, only a tiny frac­tion of those who fell ill – just 128, or 0.3 per cent – have been ad­mit­ted to the in­ten­sive care unit (ICU) as of Mon­day.</p>
    <p>Ex­perts said years of in­vest­ment in health­care, as well as a well thought out and ex­e­cuted strat­egy to keep in­fec­tion num­bers low, have helped to en­sure the Repub­lic has one of the world’s low­est ICU ad­mis­sion – and fa­tal­ity – rates from Covid-19.</p>
    <p>In the last two weeks, there has been no ad­mis­sion to the ICUs, with the last pa­tient dis­charged on July 14.</p>
    <p>Of those who were in the ICU, more than three quar­ters, or 98, have fully re­cov­ered and been dis­charged.</p>
    <p>An­other eight are re­cov­er­ing in gen­eral wards in the hos­pi­tal.</p>
    <p>Still, not every­one got well, with 18 pa­tients dy­ing from Covid-19-re­lated rea­sons while four died of other causes.</p>
    <p>Un­til now, Sin­ga­pore has had 27 Covid-19-re­lated deaths.</p>
    <p>This makes for a case fa­tal­ity rate of less than 0.1 per cent – an ex­tremely low per­cent­age com­pared with that of other de­vel­oped na­tions.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to John Hop­kins Univer­sity on Wednes­day, the United King­dom ranked high­est in case fa­tal­ity rate – an in­di­ca­tion of how likely a Covid-19 pa­tient will die in the coun­try – at 15.2 per cent.</p>
    <p>Mex­ico ranked sec­ond at 11.1 per cent and Iran came in third at 5.5 per cent.</p>
    <p>An ex­tremely low case fa­tal­ity rate like in Sin­ga­pore is a re­flec­tion of the na­tion’s high qual­ity of health­care, sug­gest­ing that doc­tors and ICU spe­cial­ists are well-trained and pre­pared to treat crit­i­cally ill pa­tients so they have a bet­ter chance of sur­vival, said Dr Phua Kai Hong, an ad­junct se­nior re­search fel­low with the In­sti­tute of Pol­icy Stud­ies at the Lee Kuan Yew School of Pub­lic Pol­icy.</p>
    <p>It also re­flects how well-stocked and equipped ICUs are so pa­tients are able to re­ceive timely and proper util­i­sa­tion when needed, Dr Phua added.</p>
    <p>“As Covid-19 slowly sub­sides, and if the qual­ity of care is main­tained, the case fa­tal­ity rate in Sin­ga­pore would look bet­ter and bet­ter when com­pared with other coun­tries,” he said, while not­ing there will be some ad­just­ments in tal­ly­ing deaths when the pan­demic fi­nally sub­sides.</p>
    <p>The low death rate and ICU ad­mis­sions are also the re­sult of Sin­ga­pore’s suc­cess in keep­ing num­bers man­age­able, said As­so­ciate Pro­fes­sor Jeremy Lim, di­rec­tor of the Global Health Pro­gramme at the Saw Swee Hock School of Pub­lic Health at the Na­tional Univer­sity of Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>“We should ap­pre­ci­ate that our low death rates are also be­cause the sys­tem was not over­whelmed like in Wuhan (China) or Lom­bardy (Italy) which had death rates much higher than in other parts of China and Italy re­spec­tively,” he said.</p>
    <p>“Of course, be­yond hav­ing a man­age­able num­ber of pa­tients, this good for­tune is built on decades of in­vest­ment in the health sys­tem, in­clud­ing send­ing so many of our doc­tors and other health pro­fes­sion­als to train in the best cen­tres glob­ally.”</p>
    <p>In the longer term, the pan­demic has sig­nalled the im­por­tance of main­tain­ing in­vest­ments in health and health­care, not just in equip­ment and fa­cil­i­ties but also in hu­man cap­i­tal, Prof Lim said.</p>
    <p>At a vir­tual press con­fer­ence on July 7, Health Min­is­ter Gan Kim Yong, who co-chairs the task force tack­ling the Covid-19 out­break, also said that the vast ma­jor­ity of pa­tients here over the past few months have been young and able to re­cover on their own, keep­ing the need for hos­pi­tal care or crit­i­cal care low.</p>
    <p>This also con­trib­uted to Sin­ga­pore’s abil­ity to keep its health­care sys­tem from be­ing over­whelmed.</p>
    <p>Pre­pared­ness is an­other key fac­tor, with health­care fa­cil­i­ties tak­ing ac­tive steps to en­sure they have enough ca­pac­ity to cope with any po­ten­tial surge i n coro­n­avirus cases, con­vert­ing their reg­u­lar wards into Covid-19-ded­i­cated ones, and train­ing their staff to deal with coro­n­avirus pa­tients.</p>
    <p>And the com­mu­nity’s role in keep­ing in­fec­tion num­bers low can­not be over­stated, said ex­perts.</p>
    <p>Mr Gan said at the July 7 press con­fer­ence: “We should never take for granted that our health­care ca­pac­ity is al­ways there.</p>
    <p>“We should al­ways be care­ful and we should al­ways do our best to min­imise com­mu­nity trans­mis­sion be­cause from our ex­pe­ri­ence, we have also seen that the in­crease in the num­ber of cases can be quite ex­po­nen­tial... There­fore, we al­ways have to be vig­i­lant and min­imise the risk of trans­mis­sion.”</p>
    <p>Other than hav­ing a ro­bust and re­silient health­care sys­tem, pre­ven­tive steps to pro­tect cit­i­zens from Covid-19 are just as para­mount, Dr Phua stressed.</p>
    <p>A com­pre­hen­sive pub­lic ed­u­ca­tion sys­tem and com­pli­ance from the pub­lic when it comes to guide­lines like mask wear­ing and safe dis­tanc­ing are crit­i­cal in slow­ing the spread of the virus, Dr Phua said.</p>
    <p>“A good pub­lic health sys­tem should not only in­form peo­ple to keep to the spirit of the rules, but also have a thor­ough en­force­ment sys­tem to catch re­cal­ci­trant of­fend­ers.”</p>
    <p>Post-pan­demic, an ex­am­i­na­tion would be needed of how Sin­ga­pore should al­lo­cate the use of its health­care fa­cil­i­ties, said Prof Lim.</p>
    <p>“Do we have enough surge ca­pac­ity? What should our plan­ning pa­ram­e­ters be? There is a cost to car­ry­ing ex­cess ca­pac­ity in peace­time and we only ap­pre­ci­ate and thank our lucky stars we have these in times of cri­sis,” he noted.</p>
    <p>On the in­ter­na­tional front, Sin­ga­pore should also be ready to con­trib­ute as a re­spon­si­ble mem­ber of the global com­mu­nity to ca­pac­ity build­ing in other coun­tries that need sup­port, and share its ex­per­tise and lessons gen­er­ously, he added.</p>
    <p>HEALTH-RE­LATED IN­VEST­MENTS</p>
    <p>In the longer term, this pan­demic would also sig­nal to Sin­ga­pore­ans and pol­i­cy­mak­ers that it is im­por­tant to keep in­vest­ing in health and health­care, not just in the equip­ment and fa­cil­i­ties used but also in hu­man cap­i­tal.</p>

    <p>WELL TRAINED, PRE­PARED</p>
    <p>An ex­tremely low case fa­tal­ity rate like in Sin­ga­pore is a re­flec­tion of a na­tion’s high qual­ity of health­care, sug­gest­ing that doc­tors and ICU spe­cial­ists are well trained and very pre­pared to treat crit­i­cally ill pa­tients, hence in­creas­ing their chances of sur­vival. It also re­flects how well stocked the ICU is on its fa­cil­i­ties and equip­ment, which would al­low pa­tients to re­ceive timely and proper</p>
    <p>’’ util­i­sa­tion when needed.</p>
