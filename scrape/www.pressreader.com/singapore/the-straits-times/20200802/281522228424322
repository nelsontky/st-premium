    <p>When the Barisan Na­sional (BN) al­liance suf­fered its first-ever elec­tion de­feat in 2018 un­der the stew­ard­ship of Na­jib Razak, it seemed his po­lit­i­cal ca­reer was all but over.</p>
    <p>As­sailed by claims of ram­pant cor­rup­tion, lav­ish spend­ing and au­thor­i­tar­ian rule dur­ing his nine years as Malaysia’s prime min­is­ter, he was seen as out of touch and a li­a­bil­ity to his Umno party.</p>
    <p>But thanks to a hugely suc­cess­ful re­brand­ing ex­er­cise, Na­jib, 67, with his pop­u­lar “Bossku” (my boss) persona and witty so­cial me­dia post­ings, emerged un­cowed by that fail­ure, with fresh grass­roots support.</p>
    <p>De­spite step­ping down from the helm of BN and Umno, he be­came a vo­cal op­po­si­tion MP, with a vis­i­ble pres­ence at sev­eral by-elec­tion cam­paigns that Umno and BN went on to win.</p>
    <p>Even the dozens of graft charges stacked up against him re­lat­ing to the 1Malaysia De­vel­op­ment Ber­had (1MDB) scan­dal did not seem to di­min­ish his in­flu­ence.</p>
    <p>That was un­til last week, when he was sen­tenced to 12 years in jail for il­le­gally re­ceiv­ing RM42 mil­lion (S$13.5 mil­lion) of funds be­long­ing to SRC In­ter­na­tional, a for­mer sub­sidiary of 1MDB.</p>
    <p>He has filed an appeal, and re­mains a free man un­til the appeal is com­pleted. But un­less the guilty ver­dict is over­turned, Na­jib can­not con­test any elec­tion.</p>
    <p>With the appeal process ex­pected to take at least a year, he will not be able to de­fend his long-held par­lia­men­tary seat in Pekan if a widely ex­pected snap elec­tion is called.</p>
    <p>He also faces another four crim­i­nal tri­als linked to 1MDB, cov­er­ing 35 charges. The first guilty ver­dict is not an aus­pi­cious start.</p>
    <p>Na­jib’s re­sponse to the judge’s rul­ing last Tues­day was rather muted.</p>
    <p>Im­pec­ca­bly dressed and look­ing ex­hausted, he said he had never asked for the RM42 mil­lion, and strangely listed Malaysia’s eco­nomic and leg­isla­tive achieve­ments dur­ing his ad­min­is­tra­tion as reasons for a more le­nient sen­tence.</p>
    <p>“This is not the end of the world,” he said later, dur­ing a press con­fer­ence out­side the court.</p>
    <p>It may not mark the end of his ca­reer, but could a po­ten­tial time­out rel­e­gate this 10-term par­lia­men­tar­ian to a back­ground role in Malaysian pol­i­tics?</p>
    <p>The pun­dits are di­vided.</p>
    <p>Sun­way Uni­ver­sity pro­fes­sor and po­lit­i­cal sci­en­tist Wong Chin Huat is of the view that Na­jib has a long road ahead in restor­ing his po­lit­i­cal cred­i­bil­ity. “If Na­jib can­not even­tu­ally clear all his charges with the fed­eral court, he would be po­lit­i­cally dead,” he said.</p>
    <p>He be­lieves the for­mer premier can re­turn to power if there is a change in gov­ern­ment that puts Umno at the helm. The cur­rent Perikatan Na­sional gov­ern­ment, which in­cludes Umno, is led by Prime Min­is­ter Muhyid­din Yassin of Parti Pribumi Ber­satu Malaysia.</p>
    <p>“Na­jib’s best bet is a change of gov­ern­ment so that Umno can be in the driv­ing seat to change the At­tor­ney-Gen­eral,” he said.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, Na­jib’s con­sid­er­able co­terie of party sup­port­ers have no doubt he will re­main on the front line. Jo­hor Umno deputy chief Nur Ja­zlan Mo­hamed told The Sun­day Times: “He can­not play a for­ward role in Par­lia­ment (if he can’t con­test elec­tions), but he can still use his sub­stan­tial in­flu­ence in the party to help re­store Umno into a lead­ing role in the gov­ern­ment.”</p>
    <p>A for­mer deputy min­is­ter dur­ing Na­jib’s ad­min­is­tra­tion, Datuk Nur Ja­zlan be­lieves Na­jib still has a role to play in help­ing Umno dis­lodge Tan Sri Muhyid­din’s Ber­satu as the lead­ing gov­ern­ment party.</p>
    <p>“For the mo­ment he should help shore up Umno grass­roots who support him to stay on course and de­liver votes for Umno,” he said.</p>
    <p>Na­jib was ear­marked for a ca­reer in pol­i­tics very early in his life.</p>
    <p>He is the el­dest son of Malaysia’s much-re­spected sec­ond premier, Tun Ab­dul Razak Hus­sein, and has in­her­ited the ti­tle of no­ble­man at the Pa­hang royal court, mak­ing him one of the most pow­er­ful in­di­vid­u­als in the country’s third-largest state after the Pa­hang monarch.</p>
    <p>His fa­ther was in­stru­men­tal in set­ting up the mul­tira­cial BN coali­tion in 1973, as well as the Fed­eral Land De­vel­op­ment Au­thor­ity (Felda) – a scheme to help the ru­ral poor be­come small­hold­ers.</p>
    <p>The Felda com­mu­nity, com­pris­ing mostly ru­ral Malays, num­bers around 1.2 mil­lion now, and many of the Felda set­tle­ments were se­cure vote banks for both Umno and Na­jib un­til the 2018 elec­tion.</p>
    <p>Na­jib was only 23 years old when he was elected MP for Pekan in 1976, tak­ing over his fa­ther’s seat when the senior died.</p>
    <p>In 1982, at the age of 29, Na­jib be­came Men­teri Be­sar of Pa­hang, his home state. He re­mains the youngest politi­cian ever to have as­sumed the post of state chief in Malaysia.</p>
    <p>The only blight in Na­jib’s up­ward tra­jec­tory before his premier­ship was dur­ing the 1999 polls, when there was an elec­toral backlash against Umno fol­low­ing then Prime Min­is­ter Ma­hathir Mo­hamad’s in­fa­mous sack­ing of then Deputy Prime Min­is­ter An­war Ibrahim.</p>
    <p>After hav­ing won the Pekan seat with com­fort­able five-fig­ure ma­jori­ties since 1976, Na­jib scraped through with a ra­zor-thin 241-vote ma­jor­ity in 1999.</p>
    <p>How­ever, in the four elec­tions since, his ma­jori­ties have not dipped be­low 20,000 votes.</p>
    <p>Last week’s con­vic­tion may prove one of the tough­est chal­lenges of Na­jib’s sil­ver-spooned po­lit­i­cal ca­reer, but his tenac­ity may yet pre­vail.</p>
    <p>Hours after the ver­dict, he posted a sar­cas­tic “thank you for your support” mes­sage at Umno col­league and ris­ing star Khairy Ja­malud­din, who had asked the party to “move on” from Na­jib.</p>
    <p>To counter crit­i­cism that the hun­dreds who crowded the High Court com­pound last Tues­day to support him were not prac­tis­ing so­cial dis­tanc­ing, Na­jib dug out pho­tos of op­po­si­tion lead­ers Ma­hathir and An­war hud­dled with their own sup­port­ers, and asked why there were dou­ble stan­dards in en­forc­ing coron­avirus rules.</p>
    <p>Bow­erGroup Asia di­rec­tor As­rul Hadi Ab­dul­lah Sani said he ex­pects Na­jib to re­main very much in the pub­lic eye.</p>
    <p>He told The Sun­day Times: “Na­jib is very pop­u­lar in Pa­hang and is still in­flu­en­tial in Umno. With the appeal process to go be­yond the next elec­tion, I ex­pect Na­jib to ac­tively cam­paign for Umno in or­der to re­main vis­i­ble.”</p>
