    <p>LOS ANGELES • Asian-Amer­i­can film-mak­ers last week ex­pressed dis­may that the Amer­i­can movie, Mi­nari, will com­pete for hon­ours at next year’s Golden Globes in the for­eign lan­guage cat­e­gory, in­stead of the higher-pro­file best drama field.</p>
    <p>Mi­nari, the story of a Korean fam­ily that moves to Arkansas to start a farm in the 1980s, won the top prize at the Sun­dance film fes­ti­val ear­lier this year and is ex­pected to be a strong con­tender in the awards sea­son next year.</p>
    <p>Its main cast and di­rec­tor are Asian-Amer­i­cans and the di­a­logue is pre­dom­i­nantly in Korean.</p>
    <p>How­ever, un­der long­stand­ing rules drawn up by the or­gan­is­ers of the Golden Globes, con­tenders for its best drama award must fea­ture di­a­logue that is at least 50 per cent in English.</p>
    <p>Lulu Wang, the Chi­nese-Amer­i­can di­rec­tor of The Farewell (2019), tweeted: “It’s a story about an im­mi­grant fam­ily, in Amer­ica, pur­su­ing the Amer­i­can dream. We re­ally need to change th­ese an­ti­quated rules that char­ac­terises Amer­i­can as only English-speak­ing.”</p>
    <p>For­mer Hawaii Five-0 (2010 to 2020) ac­tor Daniel Dae Kim said on Twit­ter that the rule felt like “the film equiv­a­lent of be­ing told to go back to your coun­try when that coun­try is ac­tu­ally Amer­ica”.</p>
    <p>Mr Ja­cob Oller, who cov­ers movies at Paste Mag­a­zine, was among some who called the rules racist.</p>
    <p>Nom­i­na­tions for t he Golden Globes will be an­nounced in Fe­bru­ary next year.</p>
    <p>The Os­cars have dif­fer­ent rules, al­low­ing South Korean drama-satire Par­a­site (2019) to be­come the first for­eign-lan­guage film to win the cov­eted Academy Award for best pic­ture in Fe­bru­ary this year.</p>
    <p>Par­a­site was ex­cluded from the best drama race at the Golden Globes in Jan­uary, but won in the for­eign lan­guage field.</p>
    <p>The Hol­ly­wood For­eign Press As­so­ci­a­tion, whose mem­bers from pub­li­ca­tions around the world choose the Golden Globe nom­i­nees and win­ners, de­clined to com­ment.</p>
    <p>The cast and di­rec­tor of Mi­nari also could not be reached for com­ment.</p>
    <p>Hol­ly­wood has made ef­forts to in­crease di­ver­sity be­hind and in front of the cam­era and at award shows since 2016, when all 20 Os­car-nom­i­nated ac­tors were white for the se­cond straight year.</p>
