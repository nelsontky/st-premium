    <p>Af­ter grad­u­at­ing from Nanyang Tech­no­log­i­cal Univer­sity (NTU) ear­lier this year with a de­gree in math­e­mat­ics and eco­nomics, Mr Chua Ru Xun strug­gled to land a per­ma­nent job.</p>
    <p>The 25-year-old turned to an SGUnited trainee­ship of­fered by IT firm Tata Con­sul­tancy Ser­vices (TCS). And since July, he has been boost­ing his knowl­edge and skills in tech­nol­ogy.</p>
    <p>Among other things, he at­tends we­bi­nars con­ducted by TCS and works with fel­low trainees on hands-on projects, in­clud­ing de­vel­op­ing an app to match dona­tions of meals to those who need them.</p>
    <p>Mr Chua is among 75 trainees who have ben­e­fited from the TCS pro­gramme, said TCS Asia-Pa­cific pres­i­dent Girish Ra­machan­dran yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The com­pany had a to­tal of 100 po­si­tions for lo­cal polytech­nic and univer­sity grad­u­ates. A new round of hir­ing for 25 spots will take place next month, he added.</p>
    <p>The nine-month trainee­ship pro­gramme by TCS al­lows re­cent grad­u­ates to de­velop in­dus­try-rel­e­vant skills and helps to boost their em­ploy­a­bil­ity in the post-coro­n­avirus econ­omy.</p>
    <p>Trainees on the TCS pro­gramme go through foun­da­tional and spe­cialised train­ing cour­ses in ar­eas such as cloud adop­tion, ar­ti­fi­cial in­tel­li­gence and cyber se­cu­rity, and get on-the-job train­ing by work­ing on projects with TCS clients.</p>
    <p>Those who do well will be con­sid­ered for avail­able full-time po­si­tions at TCS, said Mr Ra­machan­dran. Also, they will be equipped for tech jobs such as UX (user ex­pe­ri­ence) devel­op­ers, cloud engi­neers and tech devel­op­ers, he added.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, TCS also launched a new dig­i­tal ac­cel­er­a­tion cen­tre at its Sin­ga­pore of­fice, sited in Changi Busi­ness Park.</p>
    <p>De­vel­oped with sup­port from the Eco­nomic De­vel­op­ment Board, the cen­tre will pro­vide train­ing op­por­tu­ni­ties and new tech­no­log­i­cal so­lu­tions for busi­nesses look­ing to go dig­i­tal, among other things.</p>
    <p>Speak­ing at the launch event, Min­is­ter for Com­mu­ni­ca­tions and In­for­ma­tion S. Iswaran said so far, about 7,000 jobs and train­ing op­por­tu­ni­ties in the in­fo­comm tech­nol­ogy (ICT) sec­tor have been cre­ated through plat­forms like the SGUnited trainee­ships.</p>
    <p>The ICT sec­tor is an im­por­tant bright spot in the econ­omy, and “we want to con­tinue to en­sure that lo­cals are able to ben­e­fit from the op­por­tu­ni­ties that are be­ing cre­ated”, said the min­is­ter.</p>
    <p>Ms Sharon Chrishalin­i, 23, a bio­engi­neer­ing grad­u­ate from NTU, hopes the trainee­ship will pave the way for a ca­reer in IT.</p>
    <p>“Though it was chal­leng­ing tran­si­tion­ing from bio­engi­neer­ing to the pro­gram­ming field, pro­gram­ming is some­thing I like. I found the trainers very ap­proach­able, and I en­joyed the things I learnt here.”</p>
