    <p>In more than three decades of run­ning a tra­di­tional bun-mak­ing busi­ness, Mr Ang He Siong, 62, never imag­ined that he would one day sell bao, or steamed buns, stuffed with plant-based meat.</p>
    <p>But that’s what his com­pany, Lim Kee Food Man­u­fac­tur­ing, will soon mar­ket as part of its new ve­gan prod­uct range for health-con­scious cus­tomers.</p>
    <p>“We must re­fine our prod­ucts,” said Mr Ang’s son, Khim Wee, 34, Lim Kee’s head of busi­ness de­vel­op­ment, “in­stead of just stick­ing to past suc­cess­ful prod­ucts, as peo­ple’s tastes and pref­er­ences change.”</p>
    <p>Lim Kee worked with En­ter­prise Sin­ga­pore (ESG), which helped the firm build its ve­gan pro­cess­ing line and ap­ply for ve­gan cer­ti­fi­ca­tion.</p>
    <p>Its ve­gan of­fer­ings, launched in Jan­uary last year, al­ready make up about 5 per cent of rev­enue.</p>
    <p>At a press con­fer­ence last month, Min­is­ter for Trade and In­dus­try Chan Chun Sing stressed that Sin­ga­pore needed to “chart a new path by build­ing a new econ­omy”. The Govern­ment, he added, would help firms in in­dus­tries per­ma­nently changed by the pan­demic to rein­vent them­selves and pivot into new mar­kets and prod­ucts.</p>
    <p>Like Lim Kee, bath­room sup­plier SaniQUO is tap­ping govern­ment sup­port mea­sures to grow amid chal­leng­ing times. In May, it opened a store on Shopee with the help of ESG’s E-Com­merce Booster Pack­age.</p>
    <p>Con­tri­bu­tion to the rev­enue of Lim Kee Food Man­u­fac­tur­ing from its ve­gan of­fer­ings, which were launched in Jan­uary last year.</p>
    <p>To­tal rev­enue has since gone up by about 30 per cent.</p>
    <p>The pack­age helps small and medium-sized en­ter­prise re­tail­ers to take their busi­nesses on­line.</p>
    <p>Firms un­der the Scale-Up SG pro­gramme, which aims to groom high-growth com­pa­nies into global lead­ers, have also made steady progress in trans­form­ing their busi­nesses to suit the new nor­mal.</p>
    <p>Lo­cal ro­bot­ics tech­nol­ogy firm PBA Ro­bot­ics, for in­stance, rolled out its au­ton­o­mous mo­bile ro­bots at two hos­pi­tals un­der healthcare provider HMI Group in Malaysia. The ro­bots use ultraviole­t light for dis­in­fec­tion.</p>
    <p>Both groups were in the in­au­gu­ral run of the Scale-Up SG pro­gramme, in which com­pa­nies get to learn from one another to ac­cel­er­ate their plans.</p>
    <p>In the first half of the year, com­pa­nies in Sin­ga­pore em­barked on more than 10,000 projects to up­grade and trans­form their busi­ness with sup­port from ESG.</p>
    <p>Even so, ef­forts to help them sur­vive and thrive must con­tinue, as the global pan­demic thrusts the econ­omy onto a new tra­jec­tory, said ESG deputy chief ex­ec­u­tive of­fi­cer Ted Tan.</p>
    <p>“Our pri­or­ity is to help busi­nesses build greater re­silience to with­stand fu­ture shocks and more in­tense com­pe­ti­tion as it is no longer busi­ness as usual.”</p>
