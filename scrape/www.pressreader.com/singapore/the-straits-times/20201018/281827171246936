    <p>From the six-year-old or­phan she met in Rwanda, who had “a smile like the sun” de­spite los­ing his en­tire fam­ily in the geno­cide, to the moth­ers in Su­dan, who queued for hours on end to get sup­ple­men­tary food for their ba­bies, Ms Rathi Pala Kr­ish­nan’s six years in war-torn zones are full of in­deli­ble mem­o­ries.</p>
    <p>“There are so many, even from my pre-WFP days: the chil­dren from the town­ships in Wind­hoek, Namibia, who stole my heart with their songs of hope,” she told The Sun­day Times. WFP refers to the United Na­tions World Food Pro­gramme.</p>
    <p>Ms Rathi met Sefu, a mute six-year-old in July 2002 at an or­phan­age just out­side of Ki­gali, Rwanda, where he lived with an­other 100 street or or­phaned boys. She vis­ited him at the week­ends dur­ing her two years in the coun­try as a young WFP of­fi­cer.</p>
    <p>“This was out­side of my work with WFP in Rwanda. I vol­un­teered at the or­phan­age on my week­ends. I be­lieve he’s still in Ki­gali and en­tered into a fol­low-on pro­gramme to learn life skills to sus­tain him­self.”</p>
    <p>Etched in her mind is also the mem­ory of the women who would wait pa­tiently at the health cen­tres in El Geneina, West Dar­fur, to ob­tain food for their newly weaned ba­bies.</p>
    <p>“The hu­man­i­tar­ian cri­sis in Dar­fur was de­scribed as the worst cri­sis in the world back in 2004. En­tire vil­lages had been looted and burned down. The civil­ian pop­u­la­tion was be­ing sub­jected to in­dis­crim­i­nate vi­o­lence and forced to dis­place on an enor­mous scale,” she said. “The moth­ers I saw had al­ready faced sig­nif­i­cant shock and trauma. Their chil­dren were se­verely mal­nour­ished. Al­ways, it seemed to me, the moth­ers are the true he­roes. Sac­ri­fic­ing them­selves for their fam­i­lies. Work­ing in the fields, with their ba­bies tied to their backs, for com­mu­nityas­set pro­grammes to im­prove their food se­cu­rity.”</p>
    <p>Work­ing in Su­dan from July 2004 to April 2007, her field mis­sions in­cluded site visits to camps and nu­tri­tion cen­tres where fam­i­lies re­ceived food as­sis­tance of sorghum, pulses, oil, salt, sugar and food sup­ple­ments to treat their mal­nour­ished chil­dren.</p>
    <p>“The peo­ple, es­pe­cially the women, showed un­par­al­leled strength in the wake of dark­ness, pick­ing up pieces and mov­ing on. Many moth­ers would skip meals to give more to their chil­dren. They would weave bas­kets to gen­er­ate ad­di­tional in­come. They would sell ev­ery­thing they owned to make sure their chil­dren had food. They ac­cu­mu­lated debt to make sure their chil­dren went to school. I re­alised the women can’t af­ford to be weak,” she said.</p>
    <p>“At the end of the day, work­ing for the WFP doesn’t quite feel like work. I love ev­ery as­pect of my work. It’s ful­fill­ing. It’s mean­ing­ful and I truly be­lieve we are mak­ing a dif­fer­ence and hav­ing (an) im­pact on the lives of so many peo­ple who are not sure what to­mor­row may bring.”</p>
