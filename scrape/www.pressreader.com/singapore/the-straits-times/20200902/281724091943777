    <p>All work­ers stay­ing in dor­mi­to­ries, as well as those who work in the con­struc­tion, marine and process sec­tors and who visit work sites, must be swabbed to test for Covid-19 by Satur­day.</p>
    <p>The re­minder came from the Min­istry of Man­power, Build­ing and Con­struc­tion Author­ity (BCA), Health Pro­mo­tion Board (HPB) and Eco­nomic Devel­op­ment Board yes­ter­day, as 8 per cent of 1,500 em­ploy­ers have yet to log in to the HPB’s swab reg­is­tra­tion sys­tem to sched­ule their work­ers for test­ing.</p>
    <p>So far, about 62,000 work­ers who need to be tested have yet to be sched­uled.</p>
    <p>By Satur­day, they must have started their ros­tered rou­tine test­ing (RRT), which is con­ducted every 14 days. Oth­er­wise, they will not be able to re­turn to work, the au­thor­i­ties said in a joint state­ment.</p>
    <p>“We re­mind these em­ploy­ers to quickly sched­ule ap­point­ment slots for their work­ers to avoid dis­rup­tion to their busi­ness op­er­a­tions,” the state­ment said.</p>
    <p>Em­ploy­ers can sched­ule their work­ers for RRT at re­gional screen­ing cen­tres is­land­wide, such as the Old Po­lice Academy and The Float@Ma­rina Bay, and test lo­ca­tions in some pur­pose­built dor­mi­to­ries for work­ers stay­ing at dorms.</p>
    <p>Once work­ers have been sched­uled un­der the swab reg­is­tra­tion sys­tem for the first time, they will au­to­mat­i­cally be as­signed new dates for fu­ture swab tests.</p>
    <p>Em­ploy­ers are ad­vised to log in to the swab reg­is­tra­tion sys­tem reg­u­larly to sched­ule ap­point­ments if they have new work­ers.</p>
    <p>The au­thor­i­ties warned that em­ploy­ers who be­have ir­re­spon­si­bly and who per­sis­tently fail to sched­ule work­ers for RRT may have their work pass priv­i­leges cur­tailed.</p>
    <p>To date, 1,148 work­ers have had their ap­proval to re­sume work re­scinded by the BCA, af­ter a group of firms and their work­ers failed to un­dergo RRT for a pro­longed pe­riod of time, de­spite mul­ti­ple re­minders to the em­ploy­ers.</p>
    <p>Em­ploy­ers can con­tact the sec­tor leads if they have queries on the test­ing re­quire­ments.</p>
    <p>Con­struc­tion sec­tor em­ploy­ers can e-mail SRS_En­quiries@ bca.gov.sg, while those in the marine and process sec­tors can email swab@edb.gov.sg</p>
    <p>More in­for­ma­tion is avail­able on the Man­power Min­istry’s web­site for em­ploy­ers with man­u­fac­tur­ing and ser­vice work­ers who stay in dor­mi­to­ries.</p>
