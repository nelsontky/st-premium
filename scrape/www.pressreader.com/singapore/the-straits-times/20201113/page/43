The Straits Times and the National Library Board you ask, we answer, come listen Relearn how to read In the past, students could find clear answers to their questions in carefully curated and government-approved textbooks, and they could trust those answers to be true. Today, they will find multiple answers to their questions online, and it is up to them to figure out what is right and what is wrong. The sheer speed and volume of informatio­n flow have created perfect conditions for fake news to thrive. This requires youth to learn how to read better – not so much in terms of greater fluency, but with more discernmen­t. Come listen to The Straits Times senior education correspond­ent and training consultant at British Council, Singapore on why youth have to relearn how to read and what parents can do to develop critical reading skills in their children.
