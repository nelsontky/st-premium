    <p>The po­lice will re­strict the use of data col­lected in Sin­ga­pore’s na­tional con­tact trac­ing pro­gramme TraceTo­gether to “very se­ri­ous of­fences”, Home Af­fairs and Law Min­is­ter K. Shan­mugam said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Ad­dress­ing con­cerns raised in Par­lia­ment about the data be­ing ac­cessed for crim­i­nal in­ves­ti­ga­tions, the Min­is­ter said: “While that re­quire­ment is not in the leg­is­la­tion, it will be care­fully con­sid­ered within the po­lice, and dis­cre­tion will be ex­er­cised in seek­ing this in­for­ma­tion.”</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, Min­is­ter-in-charge of the Smart Na­tion Ini­tia­tive Vi­vian Balakrishn­an also re­vealed to the House that data meant for con­tact trac­ing had been used once in a mur­der in­ves­ti­ga­tion.</p>
    <p>He made his un­sched­uled re­marks a day af­ter Min­is­ter of State for Home Af­fairs Des­mond Tan said the po­lice had the power un­der the Crim­i­nal Pro­ce­dure Code (CPC) to ob­tain TraceTo­gether data in car­ry­ing out a crim­i­nal in­ves­ti­ga­tion.</p>
    <p>Mr Tan’s state­ment prompted wide­spread re­ac­tions on­line.</p>
    <p>Af­ter Dr Balakrishn­an’s re­marks about the mat­ter, Leader of the Op­po­si­tion Pri­tam Singh (Alju­nied GRC) asked un­der what cir­cum­stances the po­lice would call on TraceTo­gether data.</p>
    <p>The Work­ers’ Party chief said: “Some clar­i­fi­ca­tion of this would be quite im­por­tant for mem­bers of the pub­lic be­cause ev­ery­body wants TraceTo­gether to suc­ceed, in view of the pub­lic health con­sid­er­a­tions. But this par­tic­u­lar point has caused con­ster­na­tion and that also prob­a­bly ex­plains why Min­is­ter has de­cided to make this clar­i­fi­ca­tion.”</p>
    <p>In his re­sponse to Mr Singh, Mr Shan­mugam noted that the po­lice have a duty to use the pow­ers vested in them un­der the CPC.</p>
    <p>“To give you an ex­am­ple, let’s say there is a mur­der... and in­for­ma­tion is avail­able on the TraceTo­gether to­ken,” the min­is­ter said.</p>
    <p>“If po­lice chose not to seek that in­for­ma­tion, you can i mag­ine how the vic­tim’s family and in­deed the rest of Sin­ga­pore might re­act to that sit­u­a­tion. You could even ar­gue that there can be a ju­di­cial re­view ap­pli­ca­tion in such a sit­u­a­tion.”</p>
    <p>On the mur­der case where TraceTo­gether data was used, Dr Balakrishn­an, who is also For­eign Min­is­ter, said he was not privy to op­er­a­tional de­tails and not in a po­si­tion to com­ment fur­ther on</p>
    <p>To give you an ex­am­ple, let’s say there is a mur­der... and in­for­ma­tion is avail­able on the TraceTo­gether to­ken. If po­lice chose not to seek that in­for­ma­tion, you can imag­ine how the vic­tim’s family and in­deed the rest of Sin­ga­pore might re­act to that sit­u­a­tion. You could even ar­gue that there can be a ju­di­cial re­view ap­pli­ca­tion in such a sit­u­a­tion.</p>
    <p>HOME AF­FAIRS AND LAW MIN­IS­TER K. SHAN­MUGAM, not­ing that the po­lice have a duty to use the pow­ers vested in them un­der the Crim­i­nal Pro­ce­dure Code.</p>
    <p>the in­ves­ti­ga­tion.</p>
    <p>Mr Mu­rali Pil­lai (Bukit Ba­tok), chair­man of the Home Af­fairs and Law Gov­ern­ment Par­lia­men­tary Com­mit­tee, noted that in the gen­eral data pro­tec­tion reg­u­la­tions of the Euro­pean Union, the po­lice may ac­cess per­sonal data in re­la­tion to de­tec­tion, preven­tion, in­ves­ti­ga­tion as well as pros­e­cu­tion for crim­i­nal of­fences.</p>
    <p>“So, in a sense, there is par­ity in re­la­tion to the Sin­ga­pore sit­u­a­tion with that of the sit­u­a­tion in the EU,” he said.</p>
    <p>Dr Balakrishn­an also brought up a dis­pute be­tween tech­nol­ogy gi­ant Ap­ple and the United States’ Fed­eral Bureau of In­ves­ti­ga­tion (FBI) to high­light the po­ten­tial im­bal­ance be­tween the au­thor­i­ties’ in­ves­tiga­tive power and an in­di­vid­ual’s right to pri­vacy.</p>
    <p>In 2016, the FBI took Ap­ple to court af­ter the com­pany de­clined to cre­ate new soft­ware for it to un­lock an iPhone re­cov­ered from a ter­ror­ist who, in a De­cem­ber 2015 at­tack in San Bernardino, Cal­i­for­nia, killed 14 peo­ple and in­jured 22. The FBI later found a third party to as­sist in un­lock­ing the iPhone.</p>
    <p>Mr Vikram Nair (Sem­bawang GRC) said he sup­ported the use of TraceTo­gether in such in­ves­ti­ga­tions be­cause it is not only help­ful in find­ing out who may have been near the scene of the crime, but could also ex­on­er­ate peo­ple who are wrongly ac­cused.</p>
