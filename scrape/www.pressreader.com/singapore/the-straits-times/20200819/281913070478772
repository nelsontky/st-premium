    <p>BANGKOK • As Hong Kong prodemoc­racy ad­vo­cates voiced sup­port for Thai anti-gov­ern­ment protests at the week­end, they used the hash­tag #MilkTeaAl­liance.</p>
    <p>In Bangkok, flags rep­re­sent­ing Hong Kong and in­de­pen­dence for Tai­wan ap­peared on a sign bear­ing the tag at the big­gest demon­stra­tions in years.</p>
    <p>And in Taipei, dozens of peo­ple gath­ered to back the Thai protests and give weight to a nascent com­mu­nity of cross-bor­der youth move­ments push­ing for democ­racy at home and uneasy with China’s grow­ing power.</p>
    <p>“This is the first phys­i­cal ex­pres­sion of the Milk Tea Al­liance,” said Thai stu­dent Akrawat Siri­pat­tana­chok, 27, who helped or­gan­ise the show of sol­i­dar­ity in Taipei joined by Hong Kong ac­tivists, a Chi­nese dis­si­dent and Tai­wan stu­dents.</p>
    <p>“We don’t want to just talk about it on­line. We want a pan-Asian al­liance for democ­racy.”</p>
    <p>A hash­tag that be­gan in April as a back­lash to Chi­nese na­tion­al­ist at­tacks on a Thai celebrity for a per­ceived slight to China shows signs of turn­ing into a big­ger move­ment unit­ing like-minded ac­tivists.</p>
    <p>Why milk tea? The light-hearted name rep­re­sents a shared pas­sion for sweet tea drinks in Thai­land, Hong Kong and Tai­wan.</p>
    <p>“The in­no­va­tive idea of Milk Tea Al­liance will en­hance more stu­dents to push for­ward global sol­i­dar­ity which might con­front hard­line crack­down,” prom­i­nent Hong Kong ac­tivist Joshua Wong told Reuters. Wong, who is fac­ing charges for links to protests in Hong Kong last year, tweeted sup­port for the Thai pro­test­ers.</p>
    <p>Users on LIHKG, a so­cial me­dia fo­rum used by Hong Kong de­mon­stra­tors, also called on peo­ple to high­light the call of the Thai pro­test­ers for greater democ­racy and for the de­par­ture of Prime Min­is­ter Prayut Chan-o-cha, a former junta leader.</p>
    <p>“The show of sol­i­dar­ity be­tween dif­fer­ent pro-democ­racy groups in Asia re­flects a greater in­ten­sity and ca­ma­raderie,” Mr Parit “Pen­guin” Chi­warak, 22, one of the Thai protest lead­ers, told Reuters.</p>
    <p>Help flows both ways.</p>
    <p>Some Thai stu­dents have shown sup­port for Hong Kong ac­tivists as Bei­jing tight­ened its grip on them, and for the Tai­wan’s rul­ing Demo­cratic Pro­gres­sive Party in the face of in­creased Chi­nese rhetoric over what China views as a break­away prov­ince.</p>
    <p>Chi­nese for­eign min­istry spokesman Zhao Li­jian has dis­missed the ac­tivists’ co­op­er­a­tion.</p>
    <p>“Peo­ple who are pro-Hong Kong in­de­pen­dence or pro-Tai­wan in­de­pen­dence of­ten col­lude on­line, this is noth­ing new. Their con­spir­acy will never suc­ceed,” he said.</p>
    <p>Chi­nese his­tory pro­fes­sor Wasana Wong­surawat at Bangkok’s Chu­la­longkorn Univer­sity told Reuters: “It’s amaz­ing that the Hong Kong and Tai­wan bond ex­panded into the Milk Tea Al­liance with Thai­land, a sov­er­eign coun­try that doesn’t even list Chi­nese as a na­tional lan­guage.”</p>
    <p>Use of the hash­tag peaked in April when some Chi­nese In­ter­net users hit back against at­tacks on the Thai celebri­ties who had ap­peared to sug­gest that Hong Kong was a state and that Tai­wan was not part of China.</p>
    <p>While a few peo­ple have pro­moted it al­most daily since then, the Thai protests saw a big in­crease in its use – mostly on Twit­ter, and also Face­book, TikTok and other plat­forms.</p>
    <p>Data from a Twit­ter an­a­lytic tool showed the hash­tag was used in more than 100,000 tweets on Sun­day alone and nearly 200,000 times over the past eight days.</p>
    <p>There have also been shows of in­ter­est from the Philip­pines, be­cause of its dis­pute with China over the South China Sea, and In­dia after bor­der skir­mishes with China in May.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­porean blog­ger and ac­tivist Roy Ngerng, who was found guilty of de­fam­ing Prime Min­is­ter Lee Hsien Loong in a 2014 blog post, was also in the crowd in Taipei.</p>
    <p>“The Milk Tea Al­liance be­came the com­mon ground from which we can ex­press our sol­i­dar­ity in hu­mor­ous and safe spa­ces,” he said.</p>
