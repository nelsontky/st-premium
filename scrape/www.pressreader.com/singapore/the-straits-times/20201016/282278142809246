    <p>For me, he is a mas­sive part of what we do and he is go­ing through a pe­riod where a lot of stick is com­ing his way. He has our full sup­port.</p>
    <p>GARETH SOUTH­GATE, Eng­land man­ager, on Harry Maguire’s woes after the de­fender was sent off in Wed­nes­day’s 1-0 loss to Den­mark, com­pound­ing his poor start to the sea­son for Manch­ester United after his ar­rest in Mykonos in Au­gust.</p>
    <p>LONDON • Gareth South­gate warned Eng­land to learn from their dis­ci­plinary woes after giv­ing Harry Maguire his “full sup­port” fol­low­ing the Manch­ester United cap­tain’s dis­missal in Wed­nes­day’s 1-0 de­feat against Den­mark.</p>
    <p>The Three Li­ons suf­fered their first de­feat for a year as the de­fender was sent off for two firsthalf book­ings be­fore Chris­tian Erik­sen’s penalty sealed the Na­tions League points for Den­mark.</p>
    <p>Adding to the grow­ing sense that South­gate is strug­gling to keep his play­ers un­der con­trol, Chelsea right-back Reece James marred his first Eng­land start when he was sent off after the fi­nal whis­tle for con­fronting ref­eree Je­sus Gil.</p>
    <p>Fol­low­ing hot on the heels of Kyle Walker’s dis­missal against Ice­land last month, Eng­land have had three play­ers sent off in a cal­en­dar year for the first time.</p>
    <p>The rash of red cards comes amid off-field is­sues in which their play­ers have shown ques­tion­able judg­ment this year.</p>
    <p>Maguire was given a sus­pended sen­tence of 21 months and 10 days</p>
    <p>in pri­son after be­ing found guilty of re­peated bod­ily harm, at­tempted bribery and vi­o­lence against pub­lic em­ploy­ees on the Greek is­land of Mykonos in Au­gust.</p>
    <p>The con­vic­tion was nul­li­fied after he ap­pealed, but the in­ci­dent was fol­lowed by Phil Fo­den and Ma­son Green­wood be­ing sent home from Ice­land after breach­ing coro­n­avirus pro­to­cols by invit­ing lo­cal women back to the team’s ho­tel.</p>
    <p>Tammy Abra­ham, Jadon San­cho and Ben Chilwell missed last week’s friendly against Wales after ig­nor­ing so­cial dis­tanc­ing rules to at­tend a party.</p>
    <p>It is an alarm­ing se­quence and South­gate con­ceded Eng­land’s play­ers had only them­selves to blame.</p>
    <p>“It’s an ob­vi­ous ques­tion we’re go­ing to be asked. We’ve put our­selves in un­nec­es­sary po­si­tions off the pitch,” he said. “Of course there have been things that haven’t been right. We have ad­dressed them.</p>
    <p>“The reds for Kyle Walker and</p>
    <p>Harry Maguire here, one yel­low jus­ti­fied, one not so sure.</p>
    <p>“We’ve got to learn from it be­cause if you go down to 10, his­tor­i­cally that means we’re out, espe­cially if you’re do­ing it for an hour.</p>
    <p>“We talked all the time about dis­ci­pline be­cause we knew it cost us in other tour­na­ments.”</p>
    <p>But South­gate also made it clear Maguire could count on his back­ing.</p>
    <p>“For me, he is a top player, a mas­sive part of what we do and he is go­ing through a pe­riod where a lot of stick is com­ing his way,” he said.</p>
    <p>“He has our full sup­port and I know his club will be the same. We have to­tal be­lief in him.”</p>
    <p>In­sist­ing Maguire would not be fazed by his trou­bles, South­gate added: “None of us want to be part of that storm. His pro­file has changed over the last cou­ple of years be­cause of the club he plays at.</p>
    <p>“He is hav­ing one of those pe­ri­ods where things are go­ing against</p>
    <p>him but things will turn.”</p>
    <p>On James’ rush of blood, the Eng­land boss said: “That’s a les­son he’s got to learn. It’s ended up some­thing that shouldn’t have hap­pened but for the over­all week, he’s made a pos­i­tive im­pres­sion.”</p>
    <p>After the boost of de­feat­ing topranked Bel­gium on Sun­day, this tepid dis­play was a step back.</p>
    <p>South­gate again sent out a cau­tious line-up with two hold­ing mid­field­ers and three cen­tre-backs, while in-form As­ton Villa play­maker Jack Gre­al­ish was left out.</p>
    <p>Tot­ten­ham striker Harry Kane, yet to be fully fit, played the en­tire match de­spite his club man­ager Jose Mour­inho’s plea.</p>
    <p>South­gate de­fended his team se­lec­tion, say­ing: “I was very proud of the per­for­mance. I thought we were ex­cel­lent with 11 men and caus­ing them all sorts of prob­lems down our right-hand side.</p>
    <p>“The send­ing-off al­ters ev­ery­thing. I don’t see the foul at all.”</p>
