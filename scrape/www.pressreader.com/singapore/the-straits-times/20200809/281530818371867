    <p>Af­ter last month’s dis­cov­ery of an in­fec­tion clus­ter at Bukit Pan­jang’s trans­port cen­tre, around 11,000 peo­ple work­ing in pub­lic bus de­pots and in­ter­changes will now be screened for Covid-19.</p>
    <p>These in­clude all bus driv­ers as well as em­ploy­ees such as ad­min­is­tra­tive staff.</p>
    <p>The au­thor­i­ties said this was an added pre­cau­tion­ary mea­sure af­ter ac­tive case find­ing un­cov­ered ev­i­dence of nearly 100 past in­fec­tions among peo­ple linked to the Bukit Pan­jang clus­ter. The idea is to de­tect and ring-fence cases as early as pos­si­ble, and pre­vent large clus­ters from form­ing.</p>
    <p>“Where in­fec­tion clus­ters form, we will promptly quar­an­tine and test close con­tacts, mount swab oper­a­tions, and sus­pend oper­a­tions at the rel­e­vant fa­cil­ity if deemed nec­es­sary,” said the Min­istry of Health (MOH) and Land Trans­port Au­thor­ity (LTA) yesterday.</p>
    <p>But the au­thor­i­ties stressed that the risk to com­muters is low, since con­tact on pub­lic trans­port is tran­sient, with driv­ers and pas­sen­gers all wear­ing masks.</p>
    <p>Shar­ing this view, Pro­fes­sor Teo Yik Ying, dean of the Na­tional Uni­ver­sity of Sin­ga­pore’s Saw Swee Hock School of Pub­lic Health, said the risk of work­place trans­mis­sion of the virus is higher.</p>
    <p>“It’s likely that bus driv­ers will be hav­ing meals to­gether or chat­ting with each other dur­ing breaks. Those are the kind of in­ter­ac­tions where they may not have their masks on and they will be in closer prox­im­ity,” he told The Sun­day Times.</p>
    <p>Last month, a new clus­ter com­pris­ing sev­eral bus driv­ers and in­ter­change staff emerged at Bukit Pan­jang In­te­grated Trans­port Hub.</p>
    <p>Af­ter the first three cases were de­tected, swab oper­a­tions were car­ried out at seven lo­ca­tions be­tween July 23 and Aug 5. They in­cluded two bus de­pots and two places of ac­com­mo­da­tion, with more than 3,700 peo­ple tested so far.</p>
    <p>Pub­lic trans­port work­ers and con­trac­tors who had been in close con­tact with con­firmed cases were tested, as were all staff at the trans­port hub and those at work­places and ac­com­mo­da­tion where con­firmed cases had been.</p>
    <p>The tests showed that six peo­ple either had ac­tive in­fec­tions or past in­fec­tions, while an­other 89 were found to have re­cov­ered from past in­fec­tions and were no longer in­fec­tious. “Of these (89) in­di­vid­u­als, 12 had pre­vi­ously been liv­ing in the dor­mi­to­ries,” the au­thor­i­ties said.</p>
    <p>“As an added pre­cau­tion­ary mea­sure, we will also be work­ing with LTA to con­duct PCR tests for the rest of the staff in the pub­lic bus in­dus­try who work at de­pots and in­ter­changes.” Poly­merase chain re­ac­tion tests are used to un­cover ac­tive in­fec­tions, although they can also be in­dica­tive of past in­fec­tions.</p>
    <p>The screen­ing of the 11,000 staff will be done over the next nine days.</p>
    <p>Pub­lic trans­port op­er­a­tors have strict hy­giene and safe man­age­ment mea­sures in place, and com­muters should do their part, which in­cludes keep­ing their masks on and not talk­ing on the bus or train, MOH and LTA said.</p>
    <p>The clus­ter at Bukit Pan­jang is be­lieved to be the first to have emerged in the com­mu­nity since the cir­cuit breaker ended on June 1.</p>
    <p>Sev­eral bus driv­ers ap­proached by The Straits Times on Fri­day con­firmed that they and their col­leagues had al­ready been swabbed and had their blood drawn for test­ing.</p>
    <p>“The swab test was noth­ing,” said one driver, who de­clined to be named. “It wasn’t painful, it was only a bit tick­lish.”</p>
