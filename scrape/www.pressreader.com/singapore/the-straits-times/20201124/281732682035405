    <p>Asked if Bei­jing’s drive for tech­no­log­i­cal in­de­pen­dence would af­fect ties or co­op­er­a­tion with the US, Dr Tian Ji­etang said this was a case of China “want­ing to do its own things well”.</p>
    <p>The wave of ris­ing pro­tec­tion­ism over tech­nol­ogy and pres­sure against China in re­cent years led to a grow­ing re­al­i­sa­tion in Bei­jing that it needed to de­velop crit­i­cal tech­nolo­gies to se­cure its own de­vel­op­ment, a Chi­nese gov­ern­ment expert said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Dr Tian Ji­etang, who stud­ies in­no­va­tion re­search for the De­vel­op­ment Re­search Cen­tre (DRC) of the State Coun­cil, China’s Cabi­net, was ex­plain­ing the drive for tech­no­log­i­cal self-suf­fi­ciency in the coun­try.</p>
    <p>The sub­ject has gained im­pe­tus af­ter it emerged as a ma­jor talk­ing point dur­ing a meet­ing of top com­mu­nist officials last month about fu­ture de­vel­op­ment plans.</p>
    <p>“We’ve re­alised that for some crit­i­cal tech­nolo­gies, if we don’t de­velop it our­selves, we will never get them,” said Dr Tian, who was among a panel of ex­perts speak­ing at a press briefing.</p>
    <p>Bei­jing is draft­ing its de­vel­op­ment plans for the next five years – known as the 14th Five-Year Plan – fol­low­ing the Fifth Plenum meet­ing last month.</p>
    <p>Tech­no­log­i­cal in­de­pen­dence has emerged as a key thrust of the lat­est blue­print.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing the Fifth Plenum, se­nior party officials set a course for China to be­come a global tech leader by 2035, and stressed that self-re­liance must be a key pil­lar of the na­tion’s mod­erni­sa­tion.</p>
    <p>The fo­cus on self-re­liance co­in­cides with a bat­tle be­tween China and the US in the field.</p>
    <p>In the past four years, Bei­jing has come un­der in­tense pres­sure from Washington which has sanc­tioned Chi­nese tech firms like Huawei and ZTE over se­cu­rity con­cerns and placed re­stric­tions on their sup­pli­ers, end­ing their ac­cess to cut­ting-edge chips, among other things.</p>
    <p>Asked if Bei­jing’s drive for tech­no­log­i­cal in­de­pen­dence would af­fect ties or co­op­er­a­tion with the United States, Dr Tian said this was a case of China “want­ing to do its own things well”.</p>
    <p>“As a de­vel­op­ing coun­try, our GDP per capita is now about US$10,000 (S$13,400) so we’ve reached the stage where we should im­prove our tech­no­log­i­cal and re­search ca­pa­bil­i­ties,” he noted.</p>
    <p>How re­la­tions would evolve be­tween the US and China un­der the next Bi­den ad­min­is­tra­tion has be­come a topic of much dis­cus­sion in re­cent days in Bei­jing.</p>
    <p>Asked about the fu­ture of USChina trade ties, an­other State Coun­cil expert struck a con­cil­ia­tory tone yes­ter­day .</p>
    <p>Ms Zhang Qi, who heads the DRC’s re­search depart­ment on for­eign eco­nomic re­la­tions, noted that the mu­tual in­ter­ests of both coun­tries are larger than their dif­fer­ences.</p>
    <p>“We think that as long as ev­ery­one holds to the prin­ci­ple of mu­tual ben­e­fits and win-win co­op­er­a­tion to man­age and con­trol dif­fer­ences and avoid tak­ing ex­treme mea­sures, then there are ac­tu­ally many things we can do to­gether,” she added.</p>
