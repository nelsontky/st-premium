    <p>• Mads Mikkelsen could be the new ac­tor in the Fan­tas­tic Beasts film se­ries (2016 to present).</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to en­ter­tain­ment news web­site Dead­line, the Dan­ish ac­tor is in talks to re­place Amer­i­can ac­tor Johnny Depp, who played the dark wizard Gellert Grindel­wald i n the first t wo movies of the fran­chise.</p>
    <p>The Fan­tas­tic Beasts se­ries is a spin-off from and pre­quel to the Harry Pot­ter film se­ries (2001 to 2011) based on the nov­els by English au­thor J.K. Rowl­ing.</p>
    <p>The move to re­place Depp came af­ter the 57-year-old ac­tor lost a li­bel case l ast week against a Bri­tish tabloid that called him a “wife beater” dur­ing his stormy re­la­tion­ship with his ex-wife, ac­tress Am­ber Heard, 34.</p>
    <p>Depp re­vealed on In­sta­gram last Fri­day he was asked by Warner Bros to re­sign from his role of Grindel­wald. He agreed to that re­quest.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to Dead­line, Mikkelsen is direc­tor David Yates’ top choice to re­place Depp. The</p>
    <p>Will it be “Bye, Johnny Depp” (left) and “Hello, Mads Mikkelsen”? 54-year-old is well known for his role as the su­pervil­lain Kae­cil­ius in the Marvel movie Doc­tor Strange (2016), which starred Bene­dict Cum­ber­batch in the tit­u­lar role.</p>
    <p>Mikkelsen is also known for play­ing the can­ni­bal psy­chi­a­trist Han­ni­bal Lecter in the crit­i­cally ac­claimed drama Han­ni­bal (2013 to 2015).</p>
    <p>The third Fan­tas­tic Beasts movie is now sched­uled to be re­leased in July 2022 af­ter be­ing moved from its pre­vi­ous re­lease date of</p>
    <p>Novem­ber next year.</p>
    <p>Pro­duc­tion for the movie has be­gun in Lon­don in Septem­ber and Hol­ly­wood Re­porter said Depp would be paid the full eight-fig­ure salary even though he filmed only one scene be­fore get­ting the axe.</p>
    <p>The movie also stars Ed­die Red­mayne as Newt Sca­man­der and Jude Law as Al­bus Dum­ble­dore, the wizard who would go on to be­come the head­mas­ter of the wiz­ard­ing school Hog­warts in the Harry Pot­ter se­ries.</p>
