    <p>NEW DELHI • Play­ers and fans yes­ter­day urged In­dia’s cricket board to re­tire M.S. Dhoni’s No. 7 jersey in a trib­ute to the two-time World Cup win­ning cap­tain.</p>
    <p>The 39-year-old called time on his 16-year-old in­ter­na­tional ca­reer on Satur­day with a cryp­tic mes­sage on his In­sta­gram post that read “From 1929hrs, con­sider me as re­tired”.</p>
    <p>The Board of Con­trol for Cricket in In­dia (BCCI) con­firmed the news in a state­ment, say­ing: “The boy from Ranchi, who made his ODI (one-day in­ter­na­tional) de­but in 2004, changed the face of In­dian cricket with his calm de­meanour, sharp un­der­stand­ing of the game and as­tute lead­er­ship qual­i­ties.”</p>
    <p>Dhoni’s le­gions of fans in­clud­ing 7.9 mil­lion Twit­ter fol­low­ers and for­mer team­mate Di­nesh Karthik said they did not want to see No. 7 on the back of any other In­dian crick­eter’s jersey.</p>
    <p>“I hope the BCCI re­tire the #7 jersey in white ball cricket. Good luck with your sec­ond in­nings in life, I’m sure you’ll have a lot of sur­prises for us there too,” wick­et­keeper-bats­man Karthik tweeted.</p>
    <p>For­mer In­dia bats­man Mo­ham­mad Kaif agreed, tweet­ing: “Can’t imag­ine any one else wear­ing a No. 7 In­dia jersey again.”</p>
    <p>While there is no pro­vi­sion to re­tire jer­seys in cricket, un­like in foot­ball, the BCCI un­of­fi­cially re­tired bat­ting great Sachin Ten­dulkar’s No. 10 shirt a few years after his re­tire­ment.</p>
    <p>Crick­eters from across the globe and In­dian me­dia also paid trib­ute to the glit­ter­ing ca­reer of Dhoni, who was born on July 7.</p>
    <p>“Wel­come to the re­tire­ment club, MSD! What a mag­i­cal ca­reer!,” for­mer Eng­land bats­man Kevin Pi­etersen tweeted.</p>
    <p>Aus­tralian opener David Warner wrote: “Con­grats M.S. Dhoni on a fan­tas­tic ca­reer, he is one of the coolest guys I’ve played against on the park.”</p>
    <p>For­mer Pak­istan skip­per Shahid Afridi added: “One of the true leg­ends of In­dian cricket and one of the great­est cap­tains, con­grat­u­la­tions on a great ca­reer, M.S. Dhoni! All the best for your fu­ture.”</p>
    <p>Dhoni, a flam­boy­ant wick­et­keeper-bats­man, led In­dia to win the in­au­gu­ral Twenty20 World Cup in 2007 and lifted the 50-over show­piece event in 2011.</p>
    <p>Dubbed “Cap­tain Cool” be­cause of his un­flap­pable style, he will con­tinue to lead the Chen­nai Su­per Kings in the new sea­son of the In­dian Premier League, start­ing in the United Arab Emi­rates next month.</p>
    <p>He quit Test cricket in 2014 and has not played for the na­tional side since In­dia’s World Cup semi-fi­nal loss against New Zealand in Eng­land last year – his 350th ODI.</p>
