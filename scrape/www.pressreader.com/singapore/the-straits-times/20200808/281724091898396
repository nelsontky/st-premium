    <p>• The United States has lifted a warn­ing to its cit­i­zens to avoid all for­eign travel due to the coro­n­avirus pan­demic, point­ing to im­prove­ments in the sit­u­a­tion.</p>
    <p>The State Depart­ment said it would in­stead re­sume con­sid­er­ing each coun­try on a case-by­case ba­sis.</p>
    <p>“With health and safety con­di­tions im­prov­ing in some coun­tries and po­ten­tially de­te­ri­o­rat­ing in oth­ers, the depart­ment is re­turn­ing to our pre­vi­ous sys­tem,” it said in a state­ment on Thursday.</p>
    <p>“We con­tinue to rec­om­mend (that) US cit­i­zens ex­er­cise cau­tion when trav­el­ling abroad due to the un­pre­dictable na­ture of the pan­demic.”</p>
    <p>The an­nounce­ment comes as Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump seeks a quick re­turn to nor­mal life in the US, which has suf­fered by far the high­est num­ber of deaths from Covid-19.</p>
    <p>But US bor­ders re­main closed to most trav­ellers from the Euro­pean Union, which also bans most Amer­i­cans due to the risk of con­ta­gion.</p>
    <p>Un­der the new rat­ings, the US is still ad­vis­ing pre­cau­tions for most coun­tries.</p>
    <p>Among the few re­cip­i­ents of the “Level 1” rank­ing – which means no spe­cial con­cerns for travel – were Tai­wan, which has won wide ac­claim for its han­dling of the coro­n­avirus pan­demic, and Aus­tralia.</p>
    <p>The US gave a Level 3 sta­tus – which means to re­con­sider travel – to many of the coun­try’s al­lies, in­clud­ing Bri­tain, France and Ger­many.</p>
    <p>It kept the Level 4 warn­ing to avoid all travel for In­dia, which has seen grow­ing cases of Covid-19.</p>
