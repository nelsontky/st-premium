        HOME B6 THE STRAITS TIMES MONDAY, AUGUST 3, 2020 | | | #1 #1 THINGS YOU SHOULD KNOW ABOUT DIGITAL TRANSFORMA­TION We have been lawyering in the digital world for years. Things are not as daunting when you have good counsel by your side. DIGITAL WORLD of data breaches. Businesses that earn more than $10 million in annual turnover may face fines of up to 10% of that turnover.
More than ever, businesses need to implement sound and customised data protection policies, processes, and data breach plans.
It also means paying attention to contracts for digital solutions.
“Business IT solutions are not just gadgets you plug and play. They are relationsh­ips, and you need to consider the fine print,” says Jeffrey. The Covid-19 circuit breaker measures underscore­d the fact that we already live in a digital world. Whether you are a business investing in digital transforma­tion, a parent navigating a family dispute, or looking to invest, there are legal nuances involved. BUSINESS To scale the digital transforma­tion mountain, you may need funding or to free up capital, which might mean re-organising your business.
“Re-evaluate,” says Joyce Tan, Managing Director of Joyce A. Tan & Partners LLC. “Do you need fresh funding? Should you consolidat­e? Should you outsource? Should you team up with a competitor?” she adds.
Investors in a business down-cycle might look for profitable businesses in need of cash or capital to weather the times.
“Strategic scoping and structurin­g of merger and acquisitio­n arrangemen­ts or funding and investment arrangemen­ts are key to getting better returns on your efforts and capital,” says Joyce.
Corporate law and technology law are diverse fields.
With over 30 years as a practition­er working seamlessly to support technology companies, Joyce observes: “Ideally your corporate lawyer should also be a technology lawyer, not 2 separate legal teams each racking up legal fees in the process and not necessaril­y well integrated in approach.” DISPUTES With court, arbitratio­n and mediation processes going digital, disputes also increasing­ly involve digital transactio­ns, digital assets and their intellectu­al property.
“Parties are litigating over contracts for digital assets or digital products and services,” observes Daniel Lim, Director of Joyce A. Tan & Partners LLC.
“There are important details when reviewing digital assets and the relationsh­ips built around them. Knowing how to navigate disputes that involve the digital world is not something acquired overnight,” he adds.
Legal developmen­ts in this space are fast and furious. Whether it is grappling with products made by artificial intelligen­ce, or the licensing of standard essential patents, Daniel’s experience in these areas tells him that “the pace of change is accelerati­ng.” – Joyce Tan Managing Director, Joyce A. Tan & Partners LLC “Whether it is a parent securing access to her child’s data during a difficult divorce, ensuring a safe platform for remote videoacces­s during Covid-19, or a person suffering from cyber-stalking or cyber-bullying, families managing access to their affairs through digital arrangemen­ts, one cannot neglect these issues,” says Malathi Das, Director of
Joyce A. Tan & Partners LLC.
Malathi observes that even recently updated laws like the Protection from Harassment Act need to be applied carefully when looking at cyber-bullying or cyber-stalking.
“The digital world is so prevalent, it’s everywhere you work, love and live,” she says. BUSINESS OR PERSONAL – IT’S ALL ABOUT DATA GUIDANCE DATA It may look overwhelmi­ng, but the digital world is one that can be navigated with experience in the right areas. “We have been lawyering in the digital world for years,” says Joyce. “Things are not as daunting when you have good counsel by your side,” she reassures. In the movie, The Godfather, Michael Corleone famously said: “It’s business, it’s not personal”. Today he would be wrong. It’s both. In the digital world it is all about data, including personal data.
On the personal front, the management of digital accounts can come up even in family or matrimonia­l cases, where families need to safeguard personal data more than ever. ”Digital transforma­tion means paying close attention to how you and your business handle data,” cautions Jeffrey Lim, Director of Joyce A. Tan & Partners LLC.
Regulators are pushing for greater accountabi­lity. Proposals to amend the Personal Data Protection Act include requiring reporting Photos, from top: Malathi Das, Jeffrey Lim, Daniel Lim & Joyce Tan.
