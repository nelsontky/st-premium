    <p>Sev­eral hours of a hear­ing of the US House an­titrust sub­com­mit­tee with four of the tech world’s most pow­er­ful</p>
    <p>CEOs ended with con­gress­men seem­ingly con­vinced the tech gi­ants should be bro­ken up. But do­ing so will be a long process as the laws them­selves will need to be tweaked to deal with the new data-based gi­ants, says US Bureau chief in Wash­ing­ton Nir­mal Ghosh. WORLD</p>
    <p>Sev­eral hours of a hear­ing of the United States House an­titrust sub­com­mit­tee with four of the tech world’s most pow­er­ful chief ex­ec­u­tives ended on Tues­day with scep­ti­cal con­gress­men and women seem­ingly con­vinced the tech gi­ants should be bro­ken up.</p>
    <p>The hear­ing fea­tured oc­ca­sion­ally sur­real ex­changes be­tween Mr Sun­dar Pichai of Google, Mr Jeff Be­zos of Ama­zon, Mr Mark Zucker­berg of Face­book and Mr Tim Cook of Ap­ple.</p>
    <p>For the most part, the four, with stud­ied meek­ness and care­fully main­tained com­po­sure, blocked, bat­ted and de­flected ques­tions from com­mit­tee mem­bers across the po­lit­i­cal di­vide.</p>
    <p>But while the CEOs were of­ten eva­sive, the ques­tions also of­ten be­trayed lit­tle un­der­stand­ing of the world they in­habit – rang­ing from ask­ing why so many e-mails go into the spam folder to minu­tiae the CEOs of these cor­po­ra­tions were at the best of times un­likely to be in­formed about.</p>
    <p>Also, as in many of these hear­ings, mem­bers of Congress seemed more in­ter­ested in their own opin­ions and in point-scor­ing on live tele­vi­sion rather than lis­ten­ing to the wit­nesses.</p>
    <p>Repub­li­can and Demo­cratic rep­re­sen­ta­tives snapped at one an­other and at the four CEOs, who were re­peat­edly cut off when they tried to an­swer ques­tions.</p>
    <p>Com­pli­cat­ing mat­ters, pol­i­tics and busi­ness prac­tices are en­tan­gled with the is­sue of the preda­tory cap­i­tal­ism that has en­abled the com­pa­nies to grow.</p>
    <p>Con­ser­va­tives have at­tacked the tech gi­ants for what they in­sist is lib­eral bias and sup­pres­sion of con­ser­va­tive views – which Mr Pichai and Mr Zucker­berg in­sisted is not the case.</p>
    <p>Ama­zon owns The Wash­ing­ton Post, and Mr Be­zos is a tar­get for Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump.</p>
    <p>That the CEOs are wealthy far be­yond the imag­i­na­tion of the av­er­age Amer­i­can is also a sore point. Mr Be­zos is re­port­edly worth about US$180 bil­lion (S$247.6 bil­lion), and Mr Zucker­berg some US$86 bil­lion. Mr Pichai is re­port­edly worth a rel­a­tively mod­est US$600 mil­lion, and Mr Cook US$625 mil­lion.</p>
    <p>The hear­ing was part of mul­ti­ple govern­ment in­ves­ti­ga­tions into the busi­ness prac­tices of big tech com­pa­nies, and whether they should be bro­ken up, as big oil and telecom­mu­ni­ca­tions com­pa­nies were, un­der US an­titrust laws.</p>
    <p>In Jan­uary, top ex­ec­u­tives from four smaller, com­pet­ing com­pa­nies – wire­less speaker maker Sonos, cell­phone grip maker PopSock­ets, gad­get start-up Tile, and busi­ness soft­ware com­pany Base­camp – laid out their com­plaints to the same an­titrust sub­com­mit­tee.</p>
    <p>Sonos chief ex­ec­u­tive Pa­trick Spence said Google and Ama­zon are able to sell their Home and Echo speak­ers at ar­ti­fi­cially low prices be­cause they make money in other ways, so they do not need to profit from speaker sales.</p>
    <p>Rather, they use them to col­lect con­sumer data that they then de­ploy to great ef­fect in their other busi­nesses, he charged.</p>
    <p>But break­ing them up will be a long process as the laws them­selves will need to be tweaked to deal with the new data-based gi­ants.</p>
    <p>At the end of Tues­day’s hear­ing, Demo­cratic Rep­re­sen­ta­tive David Ci­cilline quoted for­mer US Supreme Court Jus­tice Louis Bran­deis, say­ing: “We must make our choice: We may have democ­racy, or we may have wealth con­cen­trated in the hands of a few. But we can’t have both.”</p>
    <p>Be­hind Mr Ci­cilline sat As­so­ciate Pro­fes­sor Lina Khan, who came to at­ten­tion in 2017 as a 28-year-old Yale law stu­dent when she wrote a pa­per in the Yale Law Jour­nal mak­ing the case for an over­haul of an­titrust laws to deal with com­pa­nies like Ama­zon.</p>
    <p>“Ama­zon is the ti­tan of 21st-cen­tury com­merce,” she wrote. “Although Ama­zon has clocked stag­ger­ing growth, it gen­er­ates mea­gre prof­its, choos­ing to price below cost and ex­pand widely in­stead.”</p>
    <p>Pro-reg­u­la­tion con­gress­men and women main­tain that the same can be said of Google and Face­book. At Tues­day’s hear­ing, Demo­cratic Rep­re­sen­ta­tive Pramilla Jaya­pal said: “I think the ques­tion again here is when the dom­i­nant plat­form threat­ens... po­ten­tial ri­vals, that should not be a nor­mal busi­ness prac­tice.</p>
    <p>“Face­book is a case study, in my opin­ion, in monopoly power be­cause your com­pany har­vests and mon­e­tises our data,” she told a poker-faced Mr Zucker­berg.</p>
    <p>“And then your com­pany uses that data to spy on com­peti­tors, and to copy, ac­quire and kill ri­vals.”</p>
