    <p>Start­ing yes­ter­day, some firms will ben­e­fit from a scheme that aims to fa­cil­i­tate trade in Asean. Th­ese com­pa­nies will not have to ap­ply to the au­thor­i­ties for a hard-copy cer­tifi­cate that ver­i­fies the ori­gin of their goods. In­stead, as part of the new Asean-wide Self-Cer­ti­fi­ca­tion regime, cer­ti­fied ex­porters can self-cer­tify the ori­gin of their goods.</p>
    <p>Start­ing yes­ter­day, com­pa­nies such as DIP In­vest­ments, which pro­duces and ex­ports sur­gi­cal masks, will ben­e­fit from a scheme that aims to fa­cil­i­tate trade in Asean.</p>
    <p>They will not have to ap­ply to the au­thor­i­ties for a hard-copy cer­tifi­cate that ver­i­fies the ori­gin of their goods.</p>
    <p>In­stead, as part of the new Asean­wide Self-Cer­ti­fi­ca­tion (AWSC) regime, cer­ti­fied ex­porters can self-cer­tify the ori­gin of their goods and en­joy pref­er­en­tial treat­ment un­der the Asean Trade in Goods Agree­ment.</p>
    <p>DIP In­vest­ments man­ag­ing di­rec­tor Jaslyn Kaur told The Straits Times that the regime will al­low her to save be­tween three and four days for each ship­ment – the length of time it takes to ap­ply for a cer­tifi­cate of ori­gin for each mar­ket. Her firm pro­duces sur­gi­cal masks un­der the Mo­har Med­i­cal brand.</p>
    <p>“The time saved would help us to bring our goods to mar­ket faster, which boosts our com­pet­i­tive­ness and helps to stream­line our trans­porta­tion pro­cesses,” Ms Kaur said.</p>
    <p>Asean eco­nomic min­is­ters, at their an­nual meet­ing in 2018, agreed to al­low cer­ti­fied ex­porters to self-cer­tify the ori­gin of their goods as part of ef­forts to im­prove con­ve­nience for busi­nesses and help them save costs.</p>
    <p>Trade and In­dus­try Min­is­ter Chan Chun Sing said that year that Sin­ga­pore-based ex­porters could po­ten­tially en­joy an­nual sav­ings of about half a mil­lion dol­lars by not hav­ing to ap­ply for a hard-copy cer­tifi­cate of ori­gin.</p>
    <p>Mr Luke Goh, deputy sec­re­tary for trade at the Min­istry of Trade and In­dus­try, said in a state­ment last Fri­day that the AWSC “re­flects Asean’s de­ter­mi­na­tion to sim­plify Cus­toms pro­ce­dures and strengthen sup­ply chain con­nec­tiv­ity amidst dis­rup­tions caused by the Covid-19 pan­demic”.</p>
    <p>“It will also bring about prac­ti­cal ben­e­fits to our busi­nesses dur­ing this chal­leng­ing time,” he added.</p>
    <p>To qual­ify for the scheme, ex­porters need to ap­ply to Sin­ga­pore Cus­toms to be a cer­ti­fied ex­porter.</p>
    <p>El­i­gi­bil­ity cri­te­ria in­clude hav­ing a sound book­keep­ing and record­keep­ing sys­tem, hav­ing no record of any Rules of Ori­gin fraud and show­ing “a sub­stan­tial amount of ex­pe­ri­ence in ex­port pro­ce­dures”, ac­cord­ing to the Sin­ga­pore Cus­toms web­site.</p>
    <p>Ms Kaur said that her firm is fi­nal­is­ing a lo­ca­tion for a sec­ond re­gional plant to pro­duce sur­gi­cal masks, and that “the ex­act dol­lar amount of sav­ings would only be known to us once we have started to trans­port ship­ments from the new plant re­gion­ally”.</p>
    <p>Depart­ment head at Chi­na­town Food Cor­po­ra­tion Emily Kwek said that she will need less time to get ex­port doc­u­ments in or­der un­der the AWSC.</p>
    <p>Re­gional chief ex­ec­u­tive of South-east Asia at PSA In­ter­na­tional Ong Kim Pong said: “The scheme gives greater con­ve­nience to ben­e­fi­ciary cargo own­ers, saves time and costs, and en­sures a seam­less port clear­ance process.”</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore Busi­ness Fed­er­a­tion chief ex­ec­u­tive Ho Meng Kit said that the AWSC pushes for re­gional in­te­gra­tion, which will help busi­nesses save on tar­iffs. The scheme im­proves “mar­ket ac­cess in a more pre­dictable trad­ing en­vi­ron­ment while re­tain­ing rules-based mul­ti­lat­er­al­ism”, he added.</p>
    <p>“The scheme will also im­prove busi­ness ef­fi­ciency and pro­vide added con­ve­nience for busi­nesses, as it fur­ther stream­lines the ex­ist­ing ex­port­ing pro­cesses within Asean,” Mr Ho said.</p>
