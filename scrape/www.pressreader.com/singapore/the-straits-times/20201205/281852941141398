    <p>BEIJING • A Chi­nese space probe has blasted off from the sur­face of the Moon to re­turn to Earth, an am­bi­tious ef­fort to bring back the world’s first lu­nar sam­ples in four decades.</p>
    <p>China is look­ing to catch up with the United States and Rus­sia af­ter years of be­lat­edly match­ing their space mile­stones.</p>
    <p>The Chang’e-5 space­craft, named af­ter the myth­i­cal Chi­nese Moon goddess, left the Moon at 11.10pm on Thurs­day, said state broad­caster CCTV as mis­sion en­gi­neers riv­eted to their con­trol screens ap­plauded.</p>
    <p>A mo­d­ule car­ry­ing lu­nar rocks and soil was launched into or­bit by a pow­er­ful thrust en­gine, of­fi­cials said of the mis­sion that landed on the Moon on Tues­day.</p>
    <p>The mo­d­ule must un­dergo the del­i­cate op­er­a­tion of link­ing up with the part of the space­craft that is to bring the spec­i­mens back to Earth, China’s of­fi­cial Xin­hua news agency re­ported.</p>
    <p>The China Na­tional Space Ad­min­is­tra­tion yes­ter­day re­leased im­ages show­ing the na­tional flag un­furled f rom the Chang’e-5 probe on the Moon.</p>
    <p>In one of the im­ages, a ro­botic arm used to col­lect lu­nar sam­ples can be seen next to the flag.</p>
    <p>Sci­en­tists hope the sam­ples will help them learn about the Moon’s ori­gins, for­ma­tion and vol­canic ac­tiv­ity on its sur­face.</p>
    <p>If the re­turn jour­ney is suc­cess­ful, China will be only the third coun­try to have re­trieved sam­ples from the Moon, fol­low­ing the US and the Soviet Union in the 1960s and 1970s.</p>
    <p>This is also the first such at­tempt since the Soviet Union’s Luna 24 mis­sion in 1976.</p>
    <p>The space­craft was to col­lect 2kg of ma­te­rial in an area known as Oceanus Pro­cel­larum – or “Ocean of Storms” – a vast lava plain, ac­cord­ing to the sci­ence journal Na­ture.</p>
    <p>Xin­hua, which called the Chang’e-5 mis­sion “one of the most com­pli­cated and chal­leng­ing” in Chi­nese aero­space his­tory, said the probe worked for about 19 hours on the Moon.</p>
    <p>The sam­ples are ex­pected to be re­turned to Earth in a cap­sule pro­grammed to l and in north­ern China’s In­ner Mon­go­lia re­gion, ac­cord­ing to US space agency Nasa.</p>
    <p>Un­der Pres­i­dent Xi Jin­ping, plans for China’s “space dream”, as he calls it, have been put into over­drive.</p>
    <p>China has poured bil­lions into its mil­i­tary-run space pro­gramme, with hopes of hav­ing a crewed space sta­tion by 2022 and even­tu­ally send­ing hu­mans to the Moon.</p>
