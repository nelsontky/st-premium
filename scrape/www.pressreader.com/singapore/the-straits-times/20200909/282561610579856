    <p>LOS AN­GE­LES • Down­loads of Walt Dis­ney’s stream­ing app rose 68 per cent to 890,000 over the weekend, a sign its un­ortho­dox on­line re­lease of Mu­lan helped drive de­mand for the ser­vice.</p>
    <p>Be­sides the surge in in­stal­la­tions, con­sumer spend­ing on the app climbed 193 per cent to US$12 mil­lion (S$16.4 mil­lion) com­pared with a week ear­lier, pre­lim­i­nary data from Sen­sor Tower showed.</p>
    <p>Mu­lan, a live-ac­tion re­make of the 1998 an­i­mated hit, was re­leased on­line last Fri­day af­ter the coro­n­avirus pan­demic prompted Dis­ney to scrub its United States the­atri­cal roll­out.</p>
    <p>To watch the film, cus­tomers of its US$7-a-month Dis­ney+ ser­vice have to pay US$30 more – an ap­proach the com­pany had not at­tempted be­fore. Dis­ney is re­leas­ing the film in cin­e­mas in coun­tries that do not have the stream­ing plat­form. It is show­ing in cin­e­mas in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>The un­usual premium video down­load is con­sid­ered a test of whether stream­ing sub­scribers are will­ing to pay ex­tra fees to pur­chase con­tent.</p>
    <p>The pan­demic, which shut down the­atres around the world, has prompted Hol­ly­wood stu­dios to ex­per­i­ment with dif­fer­ent re­lease strate­gies.</p>
    <p>Com­cast’s Univer­sal Stu­dios made its Trolls World Tour film avail­able on­line in April for US$20.</p>
    <p>In July, Dis­ney put Hamil­ton – a filmed ver­sion of the Broad­way show – on its stream­ing ser­vice at no ad­di­tional cost. Hamil­ton gen­er­ated a 79 per cent or one mil­lion in­crease in week-over-week app down­loads the weekend it was re­leased, Sen­sor Tower said.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, Mu­lan has drawn a fresh wave of crit­i­cism for be­ing filmed partly in Xin­jiang, the re­gion in China where Uighur Mus­lims were al­legedly de­tained in mass in­tern­ment camps.</p>
    <p>For months, the film has faced calls for a boy­cott by sup­port­ers of t he Hong Kong anti-gov­ern­ment protests af­ter the movie’s star, Liu Yifei, said she backed the city’s po­lice, who have been crit­i­cised for their use of force against the demon­stra­tors.</p>
    <p>The lat­est back­lash against Mu­lan be­gan on Mon­day, when sev­eral so­cial-me­dia users no­ticed that in the film’s cred­its, Dis­ney thanked six gov­ern­ment en­ti­ties in Xin­jiang, a re­gion in China’s far west that is home to the Uighurs.</p>
    <p>The en­ti­ties men­tioned in the movie’s cred­its in­cluded the po­lice bureau in Tur­pan, an an­cient Silk Road city in east­ern Xin­jiang.</p>
    <p>The de­tails of Dis­ney’s part­ner­ship with the au­thor­i­ties in Xin­jiang are un­clear. The com­pany did not re­spond to an e-mailed re­quest for com­ment yes­ter­day.</p>
