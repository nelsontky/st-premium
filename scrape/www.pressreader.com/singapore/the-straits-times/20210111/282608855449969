    <p>It is only one week into the new school year, but my sec­ond child, who is tak­ing her Pri­mary School Leav­ing Ex­am­i­na­tion (PSLE) this year, is al­ready mak­ing post-ex­am­i­na­tion plans.</p>
    <p>“I can’t wait for PSLE to be over,” lamented my daugh­ter, who will turn 12 at the end of the year.</p>
    <p>She is among the first batch of stu­dents who will go through the new scor­ing sys­tem.</p>
    <p>In­stead of the old sys­tem with a T-score, which uses a for­mula to com­pare a child’s per­for­mance with that of his or her peers, the new scor­ing bands, called achieve­ment lev­els, sim­ply show a child’s per­for­mance.</p>
    <p>The changes will not make a dif­fer­ence to the cur­ricu­lum or stan­dard of the ex­ams.</p>
    <p>The Min­istry of Ed­u­ca­tion (MOE) says the new sys­tem aims to move away from an over-em­pha­sis on aca­demic re­sults by re­duc­ing the fine dif­fer­en­ti­a­tion of pupils at a young age.</p>
    <p>But if you ask my daugh­ter,</p>
    <p>I’m not sure the changes make a mean­ing­ful dif­fer­ence to what she will be go­ing through.</p>
    <p>As a par­ent, my first ques­tion was, what do the changes mean for Sec­ondary 1 post­ing?</p>
    <p>The an­swer: It will still be based on a child’s PSLE score. The scor­ing sys­tem will range from four to 32, with four be­ing the high­est score a child can get for four sub­jects.</p>
    <p>But with the new sys­tem, more pupils will have the same achieve­ment level score and there will be more schools with the same cut-off point.</p>
    <p>As a re­sult, tie-break­ers will be used when pupils with the same re­sults vie for the last place in the school in this or­der of pri­or­ity: ci­ti­zen­ship, choice or­der of school and com­put­erised bal­lot­ing.</p>
    <p>The changes, meant to shift parental mind­set to­wards a broader idea of suc­cess, are well and good. But with pupils sorted first based on re­sults, shift­ing mind­sets is ul­ti­mately a long-term goal.</p>
    <p>My hus­band and I have de­cided that the changes will not make a dif­fer­ence to how we en­cour­age and guide our daugh­ter for her ex­ams.</p>
    <p>Re­gard­less of the scor­ing sys­tem, our val­ues re­main the same – we want to see her give her best ef­fort; the re­sults are sec­ondary. We said the same thing to our elder son who sat the PSLE un­der the old scor­ing sys­tem three years ago.</p>
    <p>How­ever, at ma­jor check­points like the na­tional ex­ams, I can’t help but won­der if our de­ci­sion not to send our chil­dren for tu­ition is the right one.</p>
    <p>To let our kids en­joy their child­hood and re­duce stress, our cri­te­ria for tu­ition have al­ways been only if the child needs and wants it. So un­less both are checked, we do not send them for ad­di­tional aca­demic classes.</p>
    <p>This doesn’t mean we do not pri­ori­tise their learn­ing. It sim­ply means the re­spon­si­bil­ity of exam prepa­ra­tion lies with them. And if they need a leg-up, we are more than will­ing to get them the help they need, which we did when our son wanted help for Chi­nese in Pri­mary 5.</p>
    <p>It also means that as long as they give their stud­ies their best shot, we let them fill the rest of their free time with non-aca­demic pur­suits.</p>
    <p>More of­ten than not, a Pri­mary 6 pupil is al­ready be­sieged with re­minders about PSLE from teach­ers, rel­a­tives or friends. As par­ents, our ac­tions can help to mit­i­gate the pres­sure or add to it.</p>
    <p>To re­duce our daugh­ter’s stress, we fo­cus on her ef­fort and not the re­sults.</p>
    <p>“As long as you work hard, papa and mummy will be happy no mat­ter how many marks you get,” is what we have been telling her.</p>
    <p>I try to help her strike a bal­ance be­tween work and play so she does not burn out in the run-up to the ex­ams. Even as I re­mind her to com­plete her homework and re­vi­sion, I con­tinue to nur­ture her strengths and in­ter­ests.</p>
    <p>In my daugh­ter’s case, what brings a sparkle to her eyes in­clude read­ing books, dec­o­rat­ing or mak­ing fur­ni­ture for her doll­house and ex­plor­ing new paint­ing tech­niques from YouTube videos.</p>
    <p>While we tell her there is more to life than aca­demic re­sults, the PSLE is a mile­stone exam she has to get through, no mat­ter how much she dreads it.</p>
    <p>MOE has taken steps over the years to re­duce aca­demic stress, but the changes will not be felt overnight. In fact, a se­nior ed­u­ca­tor I spoke to agreed that par­ents and pupils may even feel more stressed while they are get­ting used to the new sys­tem.</p>
    <p>But one gen­er­a­tion down the road, if there is less of a na­tional</p>
    <p>While MOE makes systemic changes to re­duce aca­demic stress, par­ents can help by em­brac­ing the dif­fer­ent strengths of our chil­dren, be­yond their re­sults.</p>
    <p>ob­ses­sion with grades, then the slew of changes would have achieved its aims.</p>
    <p>While MOE makes systemic changes to re­duce aca­demic stress, par­ents can help by em­brac­ing the dif­fer­ent strengths of our chil­dren, be­yond their re­sults.</p>
    <p>There are mo­ments when I fret about how my daugh­ter will do.</p>
    <p>But her teach­ers tell me that she is re­spon­si­ble, a prob­lem-solver and team-player – all valu­able traits in the long term.</p>
    <p>And I am re­minded that I should be far-sighted and nur­ture life-long traits that would serve her well for life be­yond the PSLE.</p>
