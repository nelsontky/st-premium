    <p>By all counts, 2020 can be called an­nus hor­ri­bilis, a year in which many peo­ple suf­fered in some way.</p>
    <p>How­ever, it is how we re­spond in such a time that de­fines us and moulds us into peo­ple of great met­tle.</p>
    <p>The coro­n­avirus has dec­i­mated com­merce and hu­man in­ter­ac­tion, ex­act­ing a ter­ri­ble toll phys­i­cally and men­tally.</p>
    <p>When such mo­ments of ad­ver­sity come, we can re­act in one of a few ways.</p>
    <p>Some have taken it upon them­selves to stand up and be at the front lines, ei­ther by fight­ing the virus di­rectly or by help­ing oth­ers in need.</p>
    <p>Oth­ers have used the time to im­prove them­selves, catch up vir­tu­ally with old ac­quain­tances and reach out to the iso­lated, or read and re­flect on life.</p>
    <p>The virus has shown that it does not re­spect race, wealth or so­cial sta­tus.</p>
    <p>When life is so pre­car­i­ous, it should make us ponder: If our lives were de­manded of us to­day, what will we see when we look back at how we spent our time?</p>
    <p>Did we pur­sue things that a virus can wipe out in an in­stant, be it wealth, pos­ses­sions or fame, or did we try to make life bet­ter for those around us – peo­ple we love, as well as those who may be in need.</p>
    <p>Not all of us would have escaped last year un­scathed, and some may carry the scars for some time to come.</p>
    <p>But what we do here­after is up to us, and I choose to em­brace the fu­ture, how­ever un­cer­tain it may be, and con­tinue to face it with courage, for­ti­tude and de­ter­mi­na­tion, and live life with no re­grets as much as I can.</p>
