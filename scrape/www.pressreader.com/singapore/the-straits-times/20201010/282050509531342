    <p>The rich and di­verse but­ter­flies of Sin­ga­pore and Penin­su­lar Malaysia now have a spot on the world map.</p>
    <p>More than 12,700 but­ter­fly spec­i­mens from over 970 species na­tive to the re­gion have been im­mor­talised in the vir­tual world, af­ter their images and in­for­ma­tion were put on­line in the Global Bio­di­ver­sity In­for­ma­tion Fa­cil­ity, a free in­ter­na­tional bio­di­ver­sity data­base.</p>
    <p>The spec­i­mens, pre­served at the Lee Kong Chian Nat­u­ral His­tory Mu­seum (LKCNHM), were col­lected from var­i­ous lo­ca­tions in Sin­ga­pore and Penin­su­lar Malaysia be­tween 1936 and 1998, and some of the species are ex­tinct or very rare.</p>
    <p>An on­line map points out where each spec­i­men was found.</p>
    <p>Mak­ing the col­lec­tion freely ac­ces­si­ble on the In­ter­net will bridge the gap be­tween his­tor­i­cal data and cur­rent knowl­edge of but­ter­fly species in the re­gion and also ben­e­fit sci­en­tists in their re­search, said en­to­mol­o­gist Hwang Wei Song, who led the 16-month-long project.</p>
    <p>For in­stance, in­for­ma­tion about their dis­tri­bu­tion could pro­vide in­sights for con­ser­va­tion poli­cies.</p>
    <p>Dr Hwang also noted that but­ter­fly species from the re­gion are un­der-rep­re­sented in global data­bases, even though the re­gion has a larger di­ver­sity of the winged in­sect, at around 1,200 species, com­pared with Europe, which has 496.</p>
    <p>“Euro­pean in­sti­tu­tions have been digi­tis­ing their col­lec­tions much ear­lier than us,” said Dr Hwang, who is one of the mu­seum’s in­sect col­lec­tion cu­ra­tors.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore and Penin­su­lar Malaysia sit on the Sun­da­land bio­di­ver­sity hot spot, one of the bi­o­log­i­cally rich­est places on earth. “In the trop­i­cal cli­mate, you have a lot more com­plex­ity within the ecosys­tem in trop­i­cal rain­forests. That com­plex­ity al­lows for greater spe­cial­i­sa­tion and, over time, that gen­er­ates more species,” he said.</p>
    <p>Most of the species were col­lected be­tween 1960 and 1990, a pe­riod when Sin­ga­pore ur­banised rapidly and habi­tats dis­ap­peared.</p>
    <p>“With these his­tor­i­cal records on­line, sci­en­tists can do com­par­a­tive stud­ies on how wide­spread cer­tain species used to be, trace over time the de­cline of species now ex­tinct, and even iden­tify suit­able pop­u­la­tions for re-in­tro­duc­tion of those species,” Dr Hwang added.</p>
    <p>By 1990, 114 but­ter­fly species were ex­tinct in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>Ecol­o­gist and con­ser­va­tion bi­ol­o­gist Anuj Jain said: “Be­ing able to dig­i­tally see what species we had in the past and have now lost in Sin­ga­pore can be a pow­er­ful way to raise aware­ness among the pub­lic about the his­toric loss of nat­u­ral habi­tats here.”</p>
    <p>The LKCNHM, which holds the na­tion’s largest in­sect col­lec­tion, has an­other 12,000 but­ter­fly spec­i­mens to take on­line.</p>
    <p>Plans are also un­der way to digi­tise its stick in­sect spec­i­mens.</p>
    <p>Dr Hwang said: “The mu­seum has a good rep­re­sen­ta­tion of stick in­sect di­ver­sity within South-east Asia, and this re­gion has the high­est di­ver­sity of stick in­sects in the world.”</p>
