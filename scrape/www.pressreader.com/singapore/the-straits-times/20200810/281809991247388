    <p>Prime Min­is­ter Muhyid­din Yassin’s coali­tion has been roiled by de­fec­tions of se­nior fig­ures to a new Malay-based party an­nounced last Friday by Malaysia’s former premier Ma­hathir Mo­hamad.</p>
    <p>The moves threaten to weaken the four-year-old Parti Pribumi Ber­satu Malaysia, although it is not even clear if Home Min­is­ter Hamzah Zain­udin, a Ber­satu leader, would al­low the new, as yet un­named, party to be reg­is­tered.</p>
    <p>But that has not stopped three of Ber­satu’s supreme coun­cil mem­bers and a Se­lan­gor assem­bly­man from jump­ing ship, the dis­so­lu­tion of sev­eral Ber­satu di­vi­sions in Se­lan­gor and talk of more law­mak­ers quit­ting Tan Sri Muhyid­din’s party in his own state of Jo­hor.</p>
    <p>Mr Ulya Aqamah Husamudin is the third supreme coun­cil mem­ber to leave Ber­satu, fol­low­ing the foot­steps of Tun Dr Ma­hathir’s former me­dia ad­viser, Datuk Kadir Jasin, and Mr Tariq Is­mail.</p>
    <p>Jeram state assem­bly­man Mohd Shaid Rosli also quit the party on Satur­day, and said that 13 Ber­satu branches in Kuala Se­lan­gor have been dis­solved.</p>
    <p>“This will be the first di­vi­sion to be dis­banded and I am the first Ber­satu state assem­bly­man in Se­lan­gor to leave the party,” he said.</p>
    <p>There are four other Ber­satu as­sem­bly­men in Se­lan­gor.</p>
    <p>Mr Shaid said many party mem­bers were un­happy over Ber­satu’s de­ci­sion to work with Umno.</p>
    <p>“The Ber­satu lead­er­ship did not dis­cuss the col­lab­o­ra­tion with its grass­roots mem­bers. This is un­ac­cept­able for us,” he added.</p>
    <p>Klang Ber­satu di­vi­sion chief Syed Ab­dil­lah Syed Ab­dul Aziz also de­clared the dis­so­lu­tion of the di­vi­sion over the week­end in sup­port of Dr Ma­hathir’s party.</p>
    <p>“We... unan­i­mously ask to be­come mem­bers of this new party,” Mr Syed Ab­dil­lah told a news con­fer­ence on Satur­day.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to re­ports, Petaling Jaya Ber­satu di­vi­sion chief Mo­hamad Shafiri Ab­dul Karim left the party on Satur­day night, tak­ing 500 mem­bers with him, while 22 com­mit­tee mem­bers of the Ber­satu divi</p>
    <p>NOT CAV­ING IN</p>
    <p>We left the party based on our prin­ci­ples and hon­our as to not cave in to the of­fers of power and kick­backs.</p>
    <p>’’</p>
    <p>DEPUTY DI­VI­SION CHIEF SHUKOR BA­HARI, on why he and com­mit­tee mem­bers of the Ber­satu di­vi­sion in Langkawi – Tun Dr Ma­hathir Mo­hamad’s seat in Kedah – quit yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>sion in Langkawi – Dr Ma­hathir’s seat in Kedah – quit yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>“We left the party based on our prin­ci­ples and hon­our as to not cave in to the of­fers of power and kick­backs,” deputy di­vi­sion chief Shukor Ba­hari was quoted as say­ing by Har­ian Metro, a Malay daily.</p>
    <p>There is also talk of a re­volt brew­ing among Ber­satu mem­bers in Jo­hor, a claim de­nied by Jo­hor Ber­satu chair­man Ma­zlan Bu­jang. “Even if there is sup­port (for Dr Ma­hathir), it would not be more than 5 per cent (of mem­bers),” he said.</p>
    <p>Dr Ma­hathir, Malaysia’s longest­serv­ing premier, and Mr Muhyid­din founded Ber­satu in 2016.</p>
    <p>It com­prised former Umno lead­ers who wanted to top­ple then</p>
    <p>Prime Min­is­ter Na­jib Razak in the af­ter­math of the huge scan­dal sur­round­ing the trou­bled 1Malaysia De­vel­op­ment Ber­had state fund.</p>
    <p>But the two found­ing mem­bers split up fol­low­ing the Fe­bru­ary col­lapse of the Pakatan Hara­pan (PH) govern­ment, af­ter Mr Muhyid­din and other MPs left to form a new al­liance that includes Umno and Parti Is­lam SeMalaysia.</p>
    <p>Dr Ma­hathir, 95, and four other MPs were then kicked out of the party for sit­ting on the op­po­si­tion bench in Par­lia­ment.</p>
    <p>The veteran politi­cian an­nounced the for­ma­tion of his new party af­ter the Kuala Lumpur High Court al­lowed an ap­pli­ca­tion by Prime Min­is­ter Muhyid­din and three oth­ers to strike out a suit lodged by Dr Ma­hathir over the va­lid­ity of their party mem­ber­ship.</p>
    <p>Dr Ma­hathir has said that the new “in­de­pen­dent party” will nei­ther be part of the op­po­si­tion PH coali­tion nor the rul­ing Perikatan Na­sional, and in­di­cated that it will con­test a by-elec­tion in Perak on Aug 29.</p>
    <p>Op­po­si­tion leader and Parti Kead­i­lan Rakyat pres­i­dent An­war Ibrahim said Malaysia should move away from race-based par­ties to en­sure equal­ity for ev­ery­one.</p>
    <p>“Some play the bu­mi­put­era card to en­rich a few fam­i­lies and cronies. We have to put an end to this,” he said.</p>
