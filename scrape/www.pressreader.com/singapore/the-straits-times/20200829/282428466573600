    <p>• Manch­ester United and Eng­land de­fender Harry Maguire said on Thurs­day he was “scared” for his life and thought he was the vic­tim of a kid­nap­ping when he was ar­rested on the Greek re­sort is­land of Mykonos.</p>
    <p>The Red Dev­ils cap­tain was given a sus­pended sen­tence of 21 months and 10 days af­ter be­ing found guilty of re­peated bod­ily harm, at­tempted bribery, vi­o­lence against pub­lic em­ploy­ees and in­sult.</p>
    <p>How­ever, the 27-year-old told BBC Sport that plain-clothed po­lice of­fi­cers, who he says did not iden­tify them­selves, pulled over his group’s minibus, threw him off the ve­hi­cle and hit him in his legs.</p>
    <p>Maguire said he tried to run away be­cause he had no idea who the men were, in­sist­ing that his “con­science is clear” and the bribery al­le­ga­tions were “ridicu­lous”.</p>
    <p>“They hit me a lot on the legs. I was in that much of a panic. Fear. Scared for my life,” he added. “Ob­vi­ously, the sit­u­a­tion has made it dif­fi­cult for one of the big­gest clubs in the world, so I re­gret putting the fans and the club through this, but I did noth­ing wrong.</p>
    <p>“I found my­self in a sit­u­a­tion where it could have hap­pened to any­body and any­where.</p>
    <p>“I thought we were get­ting kid­napped. We got down on our knees, we put our hands in the air, they just started hit­ting us. They were hit­ting my leg say­ing my ca­reer’s over, ‘No more foot­ball. You won’t play again.’ And at this point I thought there is no chance th­ese are po­lice or I don’t know who they are, so I tried to run away.”</p>
    <p>On Wed­nes­day, his le­gal team lodged an ap­peal against the ver­dict. Un­der Greek law, the ap­peal nul­li­fies the orig­i­nal con­vic­tion so there will be a full re­trial.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to me­dia re­ports, a fight started at a night­club over claims his younger sis­ter Daisy had been in­jected with what the de­fence said was a sus­pected dat­er­ape drug, lead­ing to the ar­rest.</p>
    <p>But Ioan­nis Par­adis­sis, the pros­e­cu­tion lawyer who rep­re­sents the Greek po­lice­men in the case, told the Daily Mail that Maguire’s ac­count was “un­be­liev­able”.</p>
    <p>“I’ve seen and read what was said and it only adds fur­ther in­sult to the harm he caused the po­lice­men he at­tacked and the Greek jus­tice sys­tem as a whole,” he said yes­ter­day. “Three po­lice­men were in­jured and had to be treated at hospi­tal. A rich man came to Mykonos and thought he could be­have how he wants. He then goes on an in­ter­na­tional TV chan­nel to jus­tify his ac­tions and there is not a sin­gle sorry to us in any­thing he says.”</p>
