    <p>Flight crew who need to stay over­seas dur­ing lay­over flights will have to wear de­vices that track their lo­ca­tion in or­der to en­sure that they com­ply with a rule re­quir­ing them to stay in their ho­tel rooms.</p>
    <p>They are not al­lowed to phys­i­cally in­ter­act with one an­other dur­ing the lay­over pe­riod.</p>
    <p>These are among sev­eral pre­cau­tions in place to min­imise the risk of Covid-19 in­fec­tion among Sin­ga­pore Air­lines (SIA) flight crew and pas­sen­gers, said the car­rier last week in re­sponse to queries.</p>
    <p>SIA said it is com­mit­ted to en­sur­ing that all pre­cau­tion­ary mea­sures are con­stantly re­viewed to safe­guard ev­ery­one’s well-be­ing dur­ing the travel jour­ney.</p>
    <p>“We re­main guided by the au­thor­i­ties and will work closely with them to make ad­just­ments, if nec­es­sary, in or­der to en­sure the health and safety of our staff and cus­tomers dur­ing our flights,” it said.</p>
    <p>It did not dis­close how many crew mem­bers and pi­lots are tak­ing to the skies and the fre­quen­cies of their flights. But it said there are many pre­cau­tions in place to min­imise any risk of in­fec­tion.</p>
    <p>On mea­sures for pi­lots and cabin crew, SIA said they have to com­plete a health dec­la­ra­tion and take their tem­per­a­tures be­fore start­ing work. They must not re­port for duty if they are un­well.</p>
    <p>They are re­quired to ad­here to so­cial dis­tanc­ing mea­sures where pos­si­ble, such as dur­ing their pre­flight brief­ing ses­sions and also in their com­mutes to and from air­port ter­mi­nals.</p>
    <p>Cabin crew mem­bers have to wear gog­gles, as well as gloves when nec­es­sary, while in­ter­act­ing with pas­sen­gers. They also wear pro­tec­tive gowns on flights from cer­tain sec­tors, such as Lon­don and Jo­han­nes­burg.</p>
    <p>“So­cial dis­tanc­ing mea­sures that they have to ad­here to dur­ing flights in­clude no con­gre­gat­ing in the gal­ley, stag­gered meal times and re­main­ing in re­spec­tive work ar­eas at all times,” SIA said.</p>
    <p>Fresh bed­ding is pro­vided for all crew if in­flight rest is ap­pli­ca­ble.</p>
    <p>Upon their re­turn to Sin­ga­pore, all crew have to go home im­me­di­ately. “All crew who have op­er­ated to high-risk des­ti­na­tions must self-iso­late un­til they re­ceive neg­a­tive re­sults from the three swab tests that they have to take on ar­rival and on the third and sev­enth day after ar­rival,” SIA added.</p>
    <p>Mr Alan Tan, pres­i­dent of the Sin­ga­pore Air­lines Staff Union, said the flight crew have been un­der­stand­ing and com­ply­ing with the rules.</p>
    <p>“If you fly for 16 to 18 hours to reach New York, then have to stay in a room alone, it can be quite tough... but the crew un­der­stand that this is nec­es­sary,” he said.</p>
    <p>“There are some con­cerns about the im­ported cases from over­seas on flights, but it is part of our job. Crew mem­bers can take leave if they are not com­fort­able to fly.”</p>
    <p>An SIA ste­ward, who de­clined to be named, said he is “very grate­ful” that the car­rier has in­vested in per­sonal pro­tec­tive equip­ment to en­sure that crew are pro­tected, given that they have to serve a wide range of pas­sen­gers.</p>
    <p>The ste­ward, who is ros­tered for one flight a month, said: “Yes, it’s in­con­ve­nient and un­com­fort­able to wear the gown, mask and gog­gles, but if we come into con­tact with pas­sen­gers who are un­well or refuse to wear their mask, at least we are pro­tected,” he said.</p>
    <p>Flight crew who need to stay over­seas dur­ing lay­over flights are not al­lowed to phys­i­cally in­ter­act with one an­other dur­ing the lay­over pe­riod.</p>
