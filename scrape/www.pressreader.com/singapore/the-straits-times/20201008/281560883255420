    <p>Dr Amanda Tan (be­low), a Sin­ga­porean re­searcher, is fea­tured in an episode of BBC doc­u­men­tary Pri­mates. The as­sis­tant pro­fes­sor of pri­ma­tol­ogy is shown ob­serv­ing a group of long-tailed macaques, which comb the beach on Thai­land’s Ko­ram Is­land for shell­fish and are able to use tools to get at the flesh in­side.</p>
    <p>For seven years, a Sin­ga­porean re­searcher has watched mon­keys in Thai­land demon­strate the rare abil­ity to use tools to get food.</p>
    <p>Dr Amanda Tan, an as­sis­tant pro­fes­sor of pri­ma­tol­ogy at Durham Univer­sity’s an­thro­pol­ogy de­part­ment, is fea­tured i n an episode of BBC doc­u­men­tary Pri­mates, a se­ries fo­cus­ing on the mam­mals which are the clos­est an­i­mal rel­a­tives to hu­mans.</p>
    <p>In the last of the se­ries’ three episodes, the 33-year-old is shown ob­serv­ing a group of long-tailed macaques, which comb the beach on Thai­land’s Ko­ram Is­land for shell­fish and are able to use tools to get at the flesh in­side.</p>
    <p>For ex­am­ple, they use the sharp points of rocks to open rock oys­ters, and use larger rocks as ham­mers or anvils to smash open seashells and clams.</p>
    <p>Dr Tan – whose re­search in­ter­ests in­clude an­i­mal cog­ni­tion and cul­ture, as well as tra­di­tions of tool use among pri­mates – has ob­served such be­hav­iour since 2013, but only among mon­keys by the beach and not those found in­land.</p>
    <p>In a Zoom call from Durham in Bri­tain, she tells The Straits Times: “The big ques­tion we are try­ing to an­swer is how and why these tra­di­tions evolve. We know tool use re­quires the right en­vi­ron­men­tal con­di­tions, and the an­i­mals need to have both tech­ni­cal in­tel­li­gence and the abil­ity to learn from each other.”</p>
    <p>The an­i­mal lover, who has al­ways been fas­ci­nated by how crea­tures be­have and adapt to dif­fer­ent en­vi­ron­ments, came across the topic in 2011 when she was ex­plor­ing PhD op­tions at Nanyang Tech­no­log­i­cal Univer­sity.</p>
    <p>Dr Michael Gumert, a pri­mate re­searcher, was then study­ing stone tool use among macaques. He even­tu­ally be­came Dr Tan’s PhD su­per­vi­sor.</p>
    <p>Be­fore pur­su­ing a PhD, she had grad­u­ated with a bach­e­lor’s de­gree in so­cial sciences with hon­ours from the Na­tional Univer­sity of Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>As part of her re­search, Dr Tan ob­serves the tech­niques macaques use to crack open oys­ters, how they de­velop these skills and how they learn from one an­other.</p>
    <p>She takes videos and de­tailed voice notes of their be­hav­iour, which she can re­play and an­a­lyse later when she gets back from the field.</p>
    <p>At times, she has to wade into the wa­ter – while watch­ing out for sea urchins and jel­ly­fish – to ob­serve the pri­mates from the sea, all while keep­ing a dis­tance of about 3m from them.</p>
    <p>“As I am study­ing them, I do not want to af­fect their be­hav­iour,” she ex­plains.</p>
    <p>She has be­come so fa­mil­iar with the an­i­mals that she can recog­nise each mon­key in the group – which has up to 84 an­i­mals – by their faces. They can recog­nise her too.</p>
    <p>Pro­duc­tion for the doc­u­men­tary took place over a week in Fe­bru­ary last year, with each ses­sion last­ing four to five hours a day.</p>
    <p>Dr Tan says she agreed to be fea­tured as she felt it was a good op­por­tu­nity to get more peo­ple to ap­pre­ci­ate macaques and their adapt­abil­ity.</p>
    <p>“I think these mon­keys are very smart – and this can be seen es­pe­cially when hu­mans have changed a lot of the en­vi­ron­ments these an­i­mals live in,” she says.</p>
    <p>In Sin­ga­pore, for ex­am­ple, the macaques liv­ing in the na­ture re­serves may be very close to ur­ban de­vel­op­ments such as peo­ple’s homes.</p>
    <p>They have been known to come into con­flict with res­i­dents as they are at­tracted to the food re­sources avail­able in homes and gar­dens.</p>
    <p>Dr Tan says: “In the same way, their tool use on the is­land shows that when these crea­tures are placed in a dif­fi­cult en­vi­ron­ment, they will find ways to adapt and thrive.</p>
