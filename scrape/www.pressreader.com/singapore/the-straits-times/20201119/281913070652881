    <p>My first thought was, “only in Wash­ing­ton”. My se­cond was, “where can I get one?” As fans of Pres­i­dent-elect Joe Bi­den cheered his elec­tion win near the White House two week­ends ago, a jour­nal­ist pho­tographed one who was cloaked in a Nato flag.</p>
    <p>That mi­na­tory com­pass on a blue back­ground would have stood out against the walls of left­ist graf­fiti there­abouts.</p>
    <p>Those who trea­sure the armed al­liance were as one with peace-sign daubers against Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump. So were the cos­mopoli­tan rich and the so­cial­ists who would tax them. So were strict lib­er­als and crit­ics of lib­er­al­ism as a cover for un­con­scious racism. For four years now, Mr Trump has brought some im­prob­a­ble peo­ple to­gether.</p>
    <p>Even be­fore his for­mal de­par­ture, his ad­he­sive ef­fect on the US left is weak­en­ing.</p>
    <p>Mod­er­ate Democrats blame the party’s mixed con­gres­sional re­sults on its off-putting rad­i­cals. The ac­cused, con­gress­woman Alexan­dria Oca­sio-Cortez among them, re­ply that can­di­dates who stood on “Medi­care for All” and other statist poli­cies got elected.</p>
    <p>Who­ever is right, these re­crim­i­na­tions have started even be­fore the re­al­i­ties of pres­i­den­tial power set in: the dashed hopes, the galling trade-offs. Each one has the po­ten­tial to turn Demo­crat against Demo­crat.</p>
    <p>A lot has been said about the fu­ture of the Repub­li­can Party after Mr Trump. But his exit is a no less dis­rup­tive event for the Democrats.</p>
    <p>The ur­gency of beat­ing him has</p>
    <p>kept their unstable com­pound of fac­tions to­gether. With­out him, they are at lib­erty to squab­ble.</p>
    <p>A truly cyn­i­cal Repub­li­can would not dis­pute Mr Trump’s elec­tion loss at all, but shoo him out, the bet­ter to has­ten the com­ing Demo­cratic feuds.</p>
    <p>Mr Bi­den has to fash­ion a Cabi­net, then poli­cies, to please a party that spans Wall Street alumni and avowed so­cial­ists.</p>
    <p>With the Demo­cratic cau­cus due to shrink in the House of Rep­re­sen­ta­tives, the se­cond group, while few in ab­so­lute</p>
    <p>num­ber there, will gain in rel­a­tive weight. And in as­sertive­ness, too.</p>
    <p>The left went along with the cen­trist here­sies of the New Democrats in the 1990s be­cause the party had been out of power for so long. Now, just four years since the last Demo­cratic pres­i­dent, there is none of that docil­ity.</p>
    <p>Mr Bi­den can at least con­sole him­self that eco­nomic pol­icy, his im­me­di­ate pri­or­ity, is given to the split­ting of dif­fer­ences. Much less ne­go­tiable (and fath­omable to a man who turns 78 this week) is the clash of un­der­ly­ing val­ues.</p>
    <p>If this year has thrown up a les­son be­yond the coro­n­avirus pan­demic, it is that a – per­haps the – cul­ture war burns within the left, not be­tween left and right.</p>
    <p>On one side are lib­er­als who de­fine jus­tice as equal­ity be­fore the law. On the other are those who see this repub­li­can ideal as a sham, pre­fer­ring group rights along eth­nic and gen­der lines in­stead. Whether or not to “de­fund the po­lice” is but a de­tail in this ar­gu­ment over what it means to be pro­gres­sive. It is roil­ing the in­ter­nal pol­i­tics of news­pa­pers, uni­ver­si­ties and pub­lish­ing houses. It threat­ened to af­flict the Demo­cratic Party dur­ing the sum­mer of protest.</p>
    <p>In the end, the mis­sion to de­feat Mr Trump helped to pre­serve dis­ci­pline. The party can­not count on him be­yond Jan­uary.</p>
    <p>Even Mr Bi­den’s vi­sion of the United States in the world is li­able to be con­tested from within. If, by “Amer­ica is back”, he means a recom­mit­ment to the Paris cli­mate ac­cord and the like, he will have his way.</p>
    <p>But if he en­vis­ages a stee­l­ier kind of world lead­er­ship (for­mer pres­i­dent Barack Obama, whom he served as vice-pres­i­dent, bombed seven coun­tries in his last years), he can ex­pect to be bucked by a gen­er­a­tion of Democrats who have few happy mem­o­ries of US force abroad.</p>
    <p>All suc­cess­ful par­ties in all democ­ra­cies are coali­tions of a sort. But with its vast pop­u­la­tion and two-party sys­tem, the US takes the con­cept to an ex­treme.</p>
    <p>Some 330 mil­lion peo­ple have to choose be­tween the Democrats and the Repub­li­cans, forc­ing each to en­com­pass an epic range of views and in­ter­ests. The Democrats must speak for Ore­gon, which voted to de­crim­i­nalise the pos­ses­sion of hard drugs, and for law and or­der union mem­bers in the heart­land.</p>
    <p>It is too much to sug­gest they will come to miss Mr Trump. But there is no dodg­ing the fact that he has done their party man­age­ment for them for four years, serv­ing as the most ef­fec­tive Demo­cratic whip imag­in­able.</p>
    <p>With­out him, Mr Bi­den is left to choose which side of his frac­tious party to let down. It has never been clear whether his elec­tion spells the restora­tion of pre-2016 lib­er­al­ism or an open­ing for the real left.</p>
    <p>To see both camps frolic in the cap­i­tal of late is to sense that one faces griev­ous dis­ap­point­ment.</p>
