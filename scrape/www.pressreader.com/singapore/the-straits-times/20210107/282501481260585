    <p>In this ex­per­i­men­tal pro­duc­tion, 10 ac­tors will con­struct and de­con­struct a stage – lit­er­ally and metaphor­i­cally – as they take a re­flex­ive look at the value of the­atre.</p>
    <p>“You will see 10 ac­tors on stage, play­ing dif­fer­ent roles, but at the same time also be­ing them­selves,” says Liu Xiaoyi, 38, artis­tic direc­tor of the Emer­gency Stairs the­atre group.</p>
    <p>“The main ob­jec­tive is to ques­tion what the value of the­atre and art-mak­ing is and how to mea­sure it.”</p>
    <p>Off­stage 3.0 is the third it­er­a­tion of a project by Emer­gency Shel­ter, the train­ing and re­search plat­form of Emer­gency Stairs.</p>
    <p>In 2018, Off­stage 1.0 reimag­ined off­stage roles as char­ac­ters. And in 2019, Off­stage 2.0 opened up its cre­ation process to au­di­ence mem­bers, al­though the fi­nal per­for­mance was sub­se­quently staged be­hind closed doors, sans au­di­ence.</p>
    <p>The Emer­gency Shel­ter artiste train­ing pro­gramme, Liu says, aims “to trans­form ac­tors into cre­ators, and then into lead­ers”.</p>
    <p>“So you care about not just what’s hap­pen­ing in the re­hearsal room and on stage, but also about what’s off­stage and out­side the the­atre. Hence ‘off­stage’,” he says, adding that these wider con­cerns could en­com­pass is­sues such as arts hous­ing, fund­ing and poli­cies.</p>
    <p>As for Off­stage 3.0, he hopes it will func­tion as a piece of crit­i­cism.</p>
    <p>“I don’t think there is enough space for crit­i­cism in Sin­ga­pore. We don’t have enough com­men­tary on what we are do­ing, there­fore it is just one pro­duc­tion af­ter an­other,” he says.</p>
    <p>“Some­times we need to stop and look back, and ques­tion our­selves, our peers, our poli­cies, our re­view­ers.”</p>
