    <p>NEW YORK Pro­tracted ne­go­ti­a­tions in­volv­ing the Na­tional Hockey League (NHL), its board of gov­er­nors, the play­ers’ union and sev­eral mov­ing parts re­lated to mu­nic­i­pal, state, pro­vin­cial and na­tional pro­to­cols in Canada and the United States cul­mi­nated on Sun­day with an agree­ment for next sea­son.</p>
    <p>The 2020-21 NHL reg­u­lar sea­son will be­gin on Jan 13 and, if all goes ac­cord­ing to plan, end in mid-July af­ter a 56-game reg­u­lar sea­son and a 16-team, four-round play-off best-of-seven se­ries fea­tur­ing the top four teams from each di­vi­sion.</p>
    <p>The league hopes to re­turn to its reg­u­lar 82-game sched­ule next Oc­to­ber for the 2021-22 sea­son.</p>
    <p>“The Na­tional Hockey League looks for­ward to the open­ing of our 2020-21 sea­son, es­pe­cially since the re­turn to play in 2019-20 was so suc­cess­ful in crown­ing a Stan­ley Cup cham­pion,” the league’s com­mis­sioner, Gary Bettman, said.</p>
    <p>“While we are well aware of the chal­lenges ahead, as was the case last spring and sum­mer, we are con­tin­u­ing to pri­ori­tise the health and safety of our par­tic­i­pants and the com­mu­ni­ties in which we live and play.”</p>
    <p>The agree­ment for the 2020-21 sea­son was a prod­uct of the lat­est round of labour talks and lo­gis­ti­cal un­der­tak­ings.</p>
    <p>Af­ter the 2019-20 sea­son was sus­pended in March, the par­ties rat­i­fied a plan for the play-offs and a col­lec­tive bar­gain­ing agree­ment that over­wrote the ex­ist­ing pact, and ex­tended it through the 2025-26 sea­son.</p>
    <p>Still, mov­ing tar­gets made fur­ther ne­go­ti­a­tions nec­es­sary, and some as­pects of the com­ing cam­paign re­mained un­clear on Sun­day.</p>
    <p>The league said it would make fur­ther an­nounce­ments re­gard­ing per­son­nel rules and health and safety pro­to­cols – in­clud­ing vac­ci­na­tion, test­ing and other Covid-re­lated is­sues – in the com­ing days.</p>
    <p>Ne­go­ti­a­tions had been com­pli­cated in part by the pres­ence of seven Canadian fran­chises.</p>
    <p>Na­tion­ally and in some of its most pop­u­lous cities like Toronto, Canada has used much stricter mea­sures than the United States to min­imise the spread of the coro­n­avirus.</p>
    <p>The NHL’s so­lu­tion was di­vi­sional re­align­ment and a seis­mic sched­ul­ing shift.</p>
    <p>There will still be four di­vi­sions – three with eight teams and one with seven – but they have been re­or­gan­ised so one di­vi­sion con­sists of all the Canadian fran­chises.</p>
