    <p>On the out­skirts of Bo­lao town, five min­utes down an over­grown dirt track into the jun­gle of south­ern China’s Guangxi re­gion, Mr Hua Chaojiang breeds co­bras by the hun­dred.</p>
    <p>An acrid smell and a cho­rus of an­gry hisses meet us when we step into the dark­ness of the three­storey red-brick build­ing. Mr Hua, who has been rais­ing snakes for 20 years, is un­fazed. He reaches into one of the pens, grabs a tail and ca­su­ally lifts up a com­plain­ing – and ven­omous – elapid snake. The fouryear-old co­bra is about as thick as Mr Hua’s mus­cled arm and nearly twice as long. He laughs when asked whether the poi­sonous snakes have ever bit­ten him. “Of course,” he replies, us­ing a metal pole with a hook to keep its fangs away from his body.</p>
    <p>De­spite their im­pres­sive size, his co­bras are starv­ing. Some are al­ready dead. It is six months since the Chi­nese gov­ern­ment banned the breed­ing and con­sump­tion of snakes and other land-based wildlife, as part of its re­sponse to the dis­cov­ery of a novel coron­avirus in the cen­tral city of Wuhan.</p>
    <p>Now that Covid-19 has turned from an epi­demic to a pan­demic, China’s pro­hi­bi­tion looks like it could be­come per­ma­nent, leav­ing Mr Hua with thou­sands of snakes and nowhere to put them. “If there is no mar­ket, what can I do with them?” he asks.</p>
    <p>To save money, Mr Hua has cut down feed­ing from five times to once a week. Even so, his walk-in freezer is nearly empty of frozen cock­erels. The hunger makes the co­bras rest­less. “Snakes fight snakes. Snakes eat snakes,” he says.</p>
    <p>The snake trade had been lu­cra­tive for Mr Hua. Before the ban, a snake would sell for about 50 yuan (S$9.80) per kilo­gram in mar­kets in neigh­bour­ing Guang­dong prov­ince. He has been grow­ing his busi­ness steadily since the 1990s, when he first started keep­ing co­bras in a small shed with half a dozen snake pens.</p>
    <p>Later he in­vested prof­its in a new build­ing to keep the poi­sonous rep­tiles far­ther from neigh­bours. He at­tended cour­ses with snake-breed­ing ex­perts and passed tests to be­come a qual­i­fied breeder. As he ex­panded, he moved most of his stock into the jun­gle, although he still keeps a few pits of ori­en­tal rat snakes, which are not ven­omous, on his orig­i­nal farm.</p>
    <p>In 2016, the in­dus­try of breed­ers and restau­rants that used wild an­i­mals for meat was es­ti­mated to have a total value of 125 bil­lion yuan. The gov­ern­ment has promised to com­pen­sate breed­ers, but the process keeps be­ing de­layed.</p>
    <p>Mr Hua, 50, has had to bor­row money to keep the busi­ness from total col­lapse. “Since the epi­demic came, it’s not been pos­si­ble to sell any­thing. I’m los­ing money on buy­ing the chicks to feed them, on pay­ing work­ers, on ev­ery­thing.”</p>
    <p>He and other breed­ers trav­elled to the re­gional cap­i­tal of Nan­ning to pe­ti­tion the gov­ern­ment — to no avail. Of­fi­cials talk of find­ing new em­ploy­ment for breed­ers but Mr Hua strug­gles to imag­ine what that could be. “I only know how to breed snakes,” he says.</p>
    <p>Mr Hua has been caught on the wrong side of global ef­forts to guard against a fu­ture out­break of another con­ta­gious pathogen. Epi­demi­ol­o­gists warn the next one could eas­ily be more deadly than Covid-19, which has in­fected more than 16 mil­lion peo­ple world­wide and re­sulted in more than 600,000 deaths.</p>
    <p>The pre­vail­ing the­ory is that it orig­i­nated in wildlife. The ear­li­est cases of novel coron­avirus iden­ti­fied in Wuhan were tied to the city’s Hua­nan mar­ket, which, according to in­de­pen­dent Chi­nese me­dia re­ports, sold a wide range of crea­tures, in­clud­ing civets, pan­golins and snakes.</p>
    <p>The ex­act trans­mis­sion path­way re­mains un­clear; the best ge­netic matches for Sars-Cov-2, the virus that causes Covid-19, have been of coro­n­aviruses car­ried by horse­shoe bats from the south-western Yun­nan prov­ince.</p>
    <p>But some sci­en­tists be­lieve the virus passed through an in­ter­me­di­ate host before reach­ing hu­mans. The pan­golin, a scaly anteater once com­mon in Asia but now en­dan­gered by high lev­els of poach­ing and traf­fick­ing, is one pos­si­ble host; another early sug­ges­tion, later shown to be un­likely, was snakes.</p>
    <p>As the country where the pan­demic be­gan, China has faced in­tense pres­sure to clean up its wildlife trade and ur­ban live an­i­mal mar­kets to safe­guard against fu­ture out­breaks. Haunted by mul­ti­ple past out­breaks — no­tably, se­vere acute res­pi­ra­tory syn­drome, or Sars, in 2003, which was traced back to palm civets — the gov­ern­ment has re­sponded sharply, with the em­pha­sis on shut­ting down the il­le­gal wild an­i­mal trade. The pro­hi­bi­tion has been hailed by en­vi­ron­men­tal­ists and epi­demi­ol­o­gists alike, but many have called for it to be ex­panded and made per­ma­nent.</p>
    <p>The glare of in­ter­na­tional scru­tiny has fur­ther com­pli­cated the gov­ern­ment’s ef­forts. The orig­i­nal dis­cov­ery of the coron­avirus in the Wuhan mar­ket sparked calls in the United States and Europe for China to close its “wet mar­kets”. These calls were mostly met with con­fu­sion in China, where ur­ban mar­kets made up of outdoor stalls or housed in large ware­houses are pre­ferred to su­per­mar­kets by the ma­jor­ity of the pop­u­la­tion as the place to buy gro­ceries.</p>
    <p>The phrase “wet mar­ket” added to the sense that the calls were mis­guided. The term orig­i­nated in Hong Kong English to de­scribe outdoor veg­etable, fruit, meat and seafood stalls, which had slip­pery floors from a mix­ture of dis­carded food waste and wa­ter used to clean pro­duce, and has no ob­vi­ous equiv­a­lent in Mandarin Chi­nese.</p>
    <p>But this lin­guis­tic con­fu­sion is a dis­trac­tion from the more sig­nif­i­cant road­blocks China faces as it at­tempts to con­trol the wildlife trade to en­sure fu­ture biose­cu­rity. Even for a one-party state led by Pres­i­dent Xi Jin­ping, the country’s most pow­er­ful leader in decades, this is a daunt­ing task.</p>
    <p>COSTS PIL­ING UP</p>
    <p>If there is no mar­ket, what can I do with them?... Since the epi­demic came, it’s not been pos­si­ble to sell any­thing. I’m los­ing money on buy­ing the chicks to feed them, on pay­ing ’’ work­ers, on ev­ery­thing.</p>
    <p>MR HUA CHAOJIANG, who breeds co­bras. It has been six months since the Chi­nese gov­ern­ment banned the breed­ing and con­sump­tion of snakes and other land-based wildlife, and it looks like the pro­hi­bi­tion could be­come per­ma­nent, leav­ing him with thou­sands of snakes and nowhere to house them.</p>
    <p>LU­CRA­TIVE IN­DUS­TRY</p>
    <p>The snake trade was just one of dozens of wildlife in­dus­tries that boomed as China’s pop­u­la­tion grew and be­came wealth­ier. Rarer species were the do­main of China’s nou­veau riche. Carved ivory and tiger bone wine were of­ten prized pos­ses­sions and could be auc­tioned for vast sums or given as bribes to cor­rupt of­fi­cials. These prac­tices have been cur­tailed in re­cent years, thanks in part to Pres­i­dent Xi’s anti-graft cam­paign, which curbed fla­grant bribery. But more pro­saic forms of the trade have per­sisted and even grown.</p>
    <p>The country’s ris­ing wealth has cre­ated a host of mar­kets for wildlife, some le­gal, some il­le­gal and many some­where in be­tween.</p>
    <p>Prior to the pan­demic, the farm­ing and com­mer­cial trade of about 50 pro­tected species were per­mit­ted in China. Many more non-pro­tected species, such as snakes, could be bred and sold as long as the farms and busi­nesses ob­tained li­cences from the forestry au­thor­i­ties.</p>
    <p>Mr Hua’s co­bras, which had re­ceived of­fi­cial ap­proval, are mostly sold for food. Other species are traded as exotic pets for the ur­ban mid­dle class or used in Chi­nese medicines, many of which are mass-pro­duced and highly pop­u­lar. At the height of the coron­avirus out­break in China, more than 90 per cent of con­firmed Covid-19 cases in the cen­tral Hubei prov­ince were treated with tra­di­tional Chi­nese medicines, according to lo­cal of­fi­cials. Many of these reme­dies are plant- and min­eral-based, but some also use wild an­i­mal parts. An in­jec­tion that con­tains bear bile was given to more than 30,000 pa­tients in 90 hos­pi­tals across China.</p>
    <p>The grow­ing de­mand for wildlife has brought an­i­mal dis­eases up close with hu­man pop­u­la­tions.</p>
    <p>NO PER­MIT YET</p>
    <p>We have been to the forestry bu­reau to seek advice and we want to ap­ply for a for­mal busi­ness li­cence, but there is no ap­pro­pri­ate per­mit for us to ap­ply for, so we are in ’’ a grey zone.</p>
    <p>OWNER LIU YIDING of Tangchao, a well-known rep­tile pet shop that used to be based in Huadi­wan and has since moved to a new lo­ca­tion.</p>
    <p>SAY­ING ‘NO’ TO TRA­DI­TION</p>
    <p>The or­di­nary peo­ple are now on my side... I dis­agree when peo­ple say it’s ‘tra­di­tion’. Lots of peo­ple have told me they used to eat, love to eat it. But now ’’ they won’t eat it.</p>
    <p>MR ZHOU JINFENG, head of the China Bio­di­ver­sity Con­ser­va­tion and Green De­vel­op­ment Foun­da­tion, on eat­ing en­dan­gered wildlife.</p>
    <p>LE­GAL LOOP­HOLES</p>
    <p>Rapid ur­ban­i­sa­tion has en­closed the trade of both wild and tra­di­tion­ally farmed an­i­mals amid densely pop­u­lated ar­eas. Ever greater con­tact be­tween hu­mans and an­i­mals is in­creas­ing the chances of trans­mis­sion and thus the risk of an emer­gent pathogen.</p>
    <p>The United Na­tions En­vi­ron­ment Pro­gramme says about 60 per cent of out­breaks since 1940 have been zoonotic, which means they orig­i­nated in an­i­mals, then mu­tated to be­come trans­mis­si­ble to hu­mans. The ma­jor­ity of those zoonotic dis­eases have been from wild an­i­mals.</p>
    <p>EcoHealth Al­liance, a non-profit group that re­searches emerg­ing in­fec­tious dis­eases, be­lieves there could be as many as 800,000 un­known pathogens in an­i­mal species with the abil­ity to in­fect hu­mans.</p>
    <p>Mar­kets such as those in Wuhan, where mul­ti­ple dif­fer­ent live wild an­i­mals are brought into close con­tact — and kept in cramped, un­hy­gienic con­di­tions — sig­nif­i­cantly in­crease the risk of in­fec­tion spillovers, ei­ther into am­pli­fier host species or di­rectly into hu­mans.</p>
    <p>Breed­ers such as Mr Hua rep­re­sent the other side of the equa­tion for the rul­ing Chi­nese Com­mu­nist Party, which faces a del­i­cate bal­anc­ing act. Stand­ing in the way of the strictest bans pos­si­ble are individual farm­ers’ liveli­hoods and pow­er­ful phar­ma­ceu­ti­cal com­pa­nies that breed wildlife for use in tra­di­tional Chi­nese medicine.</p>
    <p>Le­gal loop­holes and mixed mes­sages from the body that over­sees and there­fore plays a cen­tral role in fa­cil­i­tat­ing the wildlife trade, the Na­tional Forestry and Grass­land Ad­min­is­tra­tion, also threaten progress, ac­tivists say.</p>
    <p>In Guangxi, which pro­duces about 70 per cent of China’s snakes, some 37,000 peo­ple re­lied on the snake trade as a source of in­come. Bo­lao is in Ling­shan county, known as the “home of China’s snake breed­ers”.</p>
    <p>The re­gion has won plau­dits from Chi­nese state me­dia for us­ing the wildlife trade to spur eco­nomic growth and the al­le­vi­a­tion of poverty. Lo­cal en­trepreneur­s have banded to­gether to share best prac­tices, cre­ate modern farms and scale up the in­dus­try.</p>
    <p>After so many years of en­cour­age­ment, they are strug­gling to un­der­stand why they sud­denly are not al­lowed to farm snakes. “Lots of ex­perts have come to Ling­shan to see the in­dus­try. The higher-ups don’t un­der­stand this, so they stopped it,” says Mr Deng Cun­you, an en­thu­si­as­tic breeder in smart shoes and a white shift who helps run a lo­cal co­op­er­a­tive. “In­stead, they should have stan­dard­ised the in­dus­try, made it sci­en­tific. Peo­ple shouldn’t just be able to breed as many as they want.”</p>
    <p>The Rongji restau­rant chain, based in the south­ern city of Guangzhou, is ar­guably the world’s most suc­cess­ful snake-meat busi­ness. With 50 lo­ca­tions, it had rev­enue of 450 mil­lion yuan last year. Its more pop­u­lar dishes in­clude snake braised in gin­ger sauce and a “dragon and phoenix” soup made from chicken and snake broth.</p>
    <p>Shelves in the of­fice of its founder and owner Wang Guo­hui are stacked with culi­nary awards and empty bot­tles of ex­pen­sive whisky and Moutai, the Chi­nese grain-based spirit. On the wall is a copy of a comic painted by a fa­mous lo­cal artist that shows Mr Wang with a bright green ser­pent draped over his neck.</p>
    <p>Mr Wang is only slightly less en­thu­si­as­tic than his car­i­ca­ture and does not hold back in de­fend­ing his busi­ness. “This cur­rent one-fellswoop ap­proach is forc­ing just about all my busi­ness into clo­sure,” he says. Not many peo­ple knew how to pre­pare snakes prop­erly when he launched the busi­ness 16 years ago, which had given him a com­pet­i­tive edge, Mr Wang says. His spe­cial­ism is now a li­a­bil­ity. “If I was still de­luded into think­ing I could con­tinue, I would have been bank­rupt long ago.”</p>
    <p>Know­ing he had to find a new busi­ness, he has sold some branches and laid off staff. “If that’s the way the pol­icy is going, we can only go along with it.”</p>
    <p>The im­pact on his busi­ness aside, Mr Wang also ar­gues that ban­ning snakes out­right and per­ma­nently will rip­ple through the sup­ply chain, since snake breed­ers buy up</p>
    <p>The whole dis­as­ter is caused by the le­gal loop­holes... The ba­sis of China’s wildlife pro­tec­tion law was wrong. It’s a wildlife pro­tec­tion law in name only. The law is more about pro­tect­ing the util­i­sa­tion of wild an­i­mals, rather than pro­tect­ing them for their eco­log­i­cal ’’ value in the wild.</p>
    <p>MS GRACE GE GABRIEL, Asia re­gional di­rec­tor for the In­ter­na­tional Fund for An­i­mal Wel­fare, who be­lieves Bei­jing could make the shift from wildlife trad­ing hap­pen if it de­cided to.</p>
