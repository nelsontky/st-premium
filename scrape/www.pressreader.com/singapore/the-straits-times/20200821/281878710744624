    <p>United States Sen­a­tor Ka­mala Har­ris stoked in­ter­est in her In­dian roots yes­ter­day when she re­ferred to her Tamil-born mother and “chithis” in her speech when she ac­cepted the Demo­cratic Party’s nom­i­na­tion for vice-pres­i­dent.</p>
    <p>The word “chithis” means “aunts” in Tamil.</p>
    <p>Ms Har­ris spoke glow­ingly of her mother Shya­mala Gopalan, who at 19 left her na­tive Tamil Nadu in In­dia for the US to be­come a can­cer re­searcher.</p>
    <p>She said her mother, who died of can­cer in 2009, was “look­ing down on me from above”.</p>
    <p>In a ref­er­ence to her In­dian roots, Ms Har­ris thanked her fam­ily. “Fam­ily is my un­cles, my aunts and my chithis.”</p>
    <p>The US vice-pres­i­den­tial nom­i­nee’s In­dian back­ground has re­ceived blan­ket me­dia cov­er­age in In­dia and yes­ter­day was no ex­cep­tion.</p>
    <p>“Ka­mala Har­ris men­tions her “chithis” in her Demo­cratic Con­ven­tion speech, Twit­ter can’t keep calm,” blared a Hin­dus­tan Times news­pa­per head­line.</p>
    <p>Some parts of Tamil Nadu saw ban­ners in sup­port of Ms Har­ris pop up, a tra­di­tional way of mark­ing mo­men­tous oc­ca­sions in the south­ern state.</p>
    <p>The state’s deputy chief min­is­ter O. Pan­neer­sel­vam had ear­lier de­scribed her nom­i­na­tion as a “mo­ment of pride for Tamil Nadu”.</p>
    <p>Said Mr Su­manth Ra­man, a Tamil Nadu-based jour­nal­ist and tele­vi­sion an­chor: “I think that there is a fair amount of in­ter­est and the fact that she used to visit Chen­nai in her younger days is known to ev­ery­body (here).”</p>
    <p>He added: “There are peo­ple who are happy she has In­dian roots but peo­ple are also say­ing that she should be judged by what­ever she does and not just for be­ing of In­dian ori­gin.”</p>
    <p>The 55-year-old ju­nior sen­a­tor from Cal­i­for­nia is of mixed her­itage as her fa­ther Don­ald Har­ris was a stu­dent from Ja­maica who went on to teach eco­nom­ics at Stan­ford Univer­sity.</p>
    <p>She has been de­scribed in US me­dia as the first black woman and the first of In­dian de­scent as well to be nom­i­nated as a run­ning mate in the pres­i­den­tial elec­tion.</p>
    <p>In In­dia, a de­bate has also been rag­ing on what her nom­i­na­tion means for the South Asian coun­try.</p>
    <p>In­dia-US ties have had bi­par­ti­san sup­port through Demo­cratic and Repub­li­can ad­min­is­tra­tions over the years, and an­a­lysts here noted that Ms Har­ris’ for­eign pol­icy di­rec­tion would likely take its cue from Mr Joe Bi­den, the Demo­cratic pres­i­den­tial can­di­date.</p>
    <p>“There is bi­par­ti­san sup­port. Even then, is­sues of hu­man rights could be raised on the Kash­mir front (if the Democrats win),” said Dis­tin­guished Fel­low Ra­jeswari Pil­lai Ra­jagopalan of New Delhi-based think-tank Observer Re­search Foun­da­tion.</p>
