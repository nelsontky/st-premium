    <p>World News Day re­turns next Mon­day with more than 100 me­dia ti­tles around the world hav­ing signed up to mark the oc­ca­sion with spe­cial re­ports, in­ter­views, we­bi­nars, shows and a lot more.</p>
    <p>The Straits Times will mark the day with a spe­cial report in print and on www.strait­stimes.com</p>
    <p>The pa­per and the World Ed­i­tors Fo­rum (WEF), the community of ed­i­tors within the World As­so­ci­a­tion of News­pa­pers and News Pub­lish­ers, will launch the vir­tual global cel­e­bra­tions by host­ing a we­bi­nar from the news­room in Sin­ga­pore, fol­lowed by a 30-minute show ti­tled Jour­nal­ism Through A Pan­demic.</p>
    <p>There will be con­ver­sa­tions in Africa and Europe through­out the day, and the cel­e­bra­tions will end with a show pro­duced by the Canadian Jour­nal­ism Foun­da­tion and WEF. It will fea­ture Dr An­thony S. Fauci, di­rec­tor of the US National In­sti­tute of Al­lergy and In­fec­tious Dis­ease, and Philip­pine news web­site Rap­pler co-founder Maria Ressa.</p>
    <p>A we­bi­nar ti­tled “Covid-19: How Can You Con­trib­ute?” will fea­ture pan­el­lists such as Pro­fes­sor Dale Fisher, an in­fec­tious dis­eases ex­pert; Mr Viswa Sada­si­van, chief ex­ec­u­tive of Strate­gic Moves and for­mer Nom­i­nated MP; Dr June Tay, head of the dig­i­tal me­dia pro­gramme, School of Sci­ence and Tech­nol­ogy at the Sin­ga­pore Uni­ver­sity of So­cial Sci­ences (SUSS); and sev­eral ed­i­tors from the re­gion.</p>
    <p>They will dis­cuss the per­ils of the “in­fo­demic” dur­ing the Covid-19 out­break, the next steps to tackle Covid-19 and pos­si­ble so­lu­tions to key is­sues that have emerged as coun­tries and peo­ple grap­ple with the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>In ad­di­tion, a short video by the National Youth Achieve­ment Award (NYAA) Coun­cil and the SUSS on youth change­mak­ers im­prov­ing the plight of those im­pacted by the virus will be screened dur­ing the we­bi­nar.</p>
    <p>Said NYAA Coun­cil ex­ec­u­tive di­rec­tor James Soh: “In today’s world, peo­ple need pos­i­tive role mod­els who can in­spire and mo­ti­vate oth­ers to do good.</p>
    <p>“This WND2020 we­bi­nar would be an ex­cel­lent plat­form to in­stil pos­i­tive change, es­pe­cially dur­ing a cri­sis.”</p>
    <p>The we­bi­nar is open to the pub­lic and will be held via tele­con­fer­enc­ing plat­form Zoom next Mon­day from 4pm to 5.30pm Sin­ga­pore time.</p>
    <p>Those wish­ing to join in can regis­ter at str.sg/WND2020</p>
    <p>Back in Asia for the sec­ond year, World News Day aims to show­case the im­por­tance of hav­ing re­li­able sources of in­for­ma­tion and news to help peo­ple keep up with de­vel­op­ments and make sense of the fastchang­ing world around them.</p>
    <p>“Many have looked to au­thor­i­ta­tive jour­nal­ists and pro­fes­sional news­rooms for an­swers,” said Mr War­ren Fer­nan­dez, ed­i­tor-in-chief of Sin­ga­pore Press Hold­ings’ English/Malay/Tamil Me­dia Group and ed­i­tor of The Straits Times.</p>
    <p>“They are seek­ing out and turn­ing to those they can trust.</p>
    <p>“This is why there has been a surge in au­di­ences, and sub­scribers, for most news me­dia. Qual­ity me­dia has de­bunked much fake news about the virus. It has helped peo­ple make sense of de­vel­op­ments. It has helped bring com­mu­ni­ties to­gether,” he said.</p>
    <p>Ef­forts to de­liver qual­ity cover­age to read­ers will also be high­lighted in ST’s show, Jour­nal­ism Through A Pan­demic, which will fea­ture on-the-ground footage of cor­re­spon­dents across Asia.</p>
    <p>This in­cludes Straits Times China cor­re­spon­dent El­iz­a­beth Law’s for­mi­da­ble jour­ney to Wuhan’s Hua­nan Seafood Mar­ket as one of the first re­porters to visit the area – no­to­ri­ously known to be the source of the vi­ral in­fec­tions in China.</p>
    <p>Last year, more than 40 news­rooms around the world came to­gether to cel­e­brate World News Day 2019 through fo­rums, a live show and story con­tri­bu­tions on why real news mat­ters.</p>
    <p>Out of the more than 100 par­tic­i­pat­ing news­rooms this year, 20 are from Asia-Pa­cific, 10 from South Asia, 25 from Africa, 17 from Europe, 18 from Latin Amer­ica and 20 from North Amer­ica.</p>
