    <p>Jakarta’s Health Agency head Widyas­tuti said the In­done­sian cap­i­tal is in the midst of a surge of work­place in­fec­tions, as of­fi­cials strug­gle to en­join a weary public to re­main vig­i­lant against Covid-19.</p>
    <p>For more than a month, Jakarta, home to an es­ti­mated 10 mil­lion peo­ple, had been mostly suc­cess­ful in crack­ing down and slow­ing the spread of in­fec­tions af­ter it be­gan lift­ing a lock­down. But non-es­sen­tial busi­nesses, in­clud­ing in some of the city’s pres­ti­gious of­fice tow­ers and lux­ury stores, have be­come hot spots just as they re­opened.</p>
    <p>Since the mid­dle of the month, some 45 clus­ters – of two or more si­mul­ta­ne­ous in­fec­tions – have emerged as res­i­dents again take trains and buses to work and min­gle with co-work­ers, of­ten with­out us­ing masks, Ms Widyas­tuti, who goes by one name, told The Straits Times last Friday.</p>
    <p>Hospi­tal beds, too, are fill­ing up again as the num­ber of pa­tients rises. And this de­spite the fact that the per­cent­age of the cap­i­tal’s hospi­tal beds al­lo­cated to Covid-19 pa­tients has dou­bled to 40 per cent.</p>
    <p>The re­ver­sal of for­tune in Jakarta un­der­scores the dif­fi­cul­ties in con­trol­ling a dis­ease in a city that is home to mil­lions of mi­grant work­ers, who ar­rive from harder-hit places else­where in the coun­try.</p>
    <p>“This is a het­ero­ge­neous city,” Ms Widyas­tuti said.</p>
    <p>“We’re not like Yo­gyakarta where the Sul­tan can is­sue an or­der and ev­ery­one obeys,” she added, re­fer­ring to the cen­tral Ja­vanese city’s widely revered monarch.</p>
    <p>Con­cern is clearly grow­ing in Jakarta about rising in­fec­tions.</p>
    <p>Last Satur­day, In­done­sia Ex­im­bank, the state-owned ex­port fi­nanc­ing agency, said it would shut its of­fices in the Sudirman Cen­tral Busi­ness Dis­trict for two weeks.</p>
    <p>Fash­ion brand Chris­tian Dior said it had shut its bou­tique in the nearby Plaza Se­nayan shop­ping mall last Satur­day ow­ing to an in­fec­tion among one of its em­ploy­ees. The shop was due to open again yes­ter­day, ac­cord­ing to a com­pany state­ment.</p>
    <p>Days ear­lier, Bank Cen­tral Asia said it had shut­tered one of its busi­ness units in the 44-storey Eq­uity Tower, just a stone’s throw away.</p>
    <p>Of­fi­cials be­gan lift­ing re­stric­tions on non-es­sen­tial busi­nesses early last month as the num­ber of ac­tive cases dropped.</p>
    <p>On June 6, the num­ber of peo­ple self-iso­lat­ing and in in­ten­sive care to­talled 4,411, of­fi­cial data showed.</p>
    <p>About a month later, by July 6, that num­ber fell to 3,835. But that tally had surged to 6,695 as of Mon­day.</p>
    <p>To be sure, a sec­ond lock­down is not im­mi­nent.</p>
    <p>Hos­pi­tals re­tain ca­pac­ity and the per­cent­age of pos­i­tive test re­sults is steady at 5.2 per cent – less than half the na­tional av­er­age but well above places like South Korea, where it is less than 1 per cent. The rate of in­fec­tion – or Rt – is 1.1, in­di­cat­ing one car­rier of the virus in­fect­ing on av­er­age slightly more than one other per­son.</p>
    <p>Con­tact trac­ing re­mains lim­ited, at roughly five other peo­ple for every new in­fec­tion. But af­ter months of im­per­fect com­pli­ance of so­cial dis­tanc­ing, fa­tigue is set­ting in.</p>
    <p>“Peo­ple are not us­ing masks,” said Dr Er­lang Sa­maoe­dro, a pul­monary spe­cial­ist at Per­sa­ha­batan hospi­tal, one of the cap­i­tal’s main hos­pi­tals for Covid-19.</p>
    <p>Nearly all of its 202 beds are filled with Covid-19 pa­tients, com­pared with 120 at the be­gin­ning of the month, Dr Er­lang said.</p>
