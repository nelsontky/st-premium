    <p>The On­line Ci­ti­zen (TOC) ed­i­tor Terry Xu was ac­cused yes­ter­day of hav­ing “de­lib­er­ately dipped his pen in poi­son” to at­tack Prime Min­is­ter Lee Hsien Loong in an ar­ti­cle on the 38 Ox­ley Road saga.</p>
    <p>PM Lee’s lawyer, Se­nior Coun­sel Davin­der Singh, also asked Mr Xu whether he was at­tempt­ing to “take a swipe” at the Prime Min­is­ter by pub­lish­ing a Face­book post and an ar­ti­cle on the law­suit.</p>
    <p>Mr Singh noted that Mr Xu did it af­ter he was served a writ of sum­mons in Septem­ber last year, fol­low­ing his re­fusal to re­move the of­fend­ing ar­ti­cle and apol­o­gise.</p>
    <p>Mr Xu de­nied both points yes­ter­day, the third day of the week­long trial on a defama­tion suit against him by PM Lee.</p>
    <p>The of­fend­ing ar­ti­cle, pub­lished in Au­gust last year, re­ferred to PM Lee’s sis­ter Lee Wei Ling’s re­marks al­leg­ing that her brother had mis­led their late father Lee Kuan Yew into believ­ing their Ox­ley home had been gazetted by the Gov­ern­ment.</p>
    <p>In the cross-ex­am­i­na­tion, Mr Singh put it to Mr Xu that he was set­ting out to at­tack PM Lee in the ar­ti­cle, ti­tled “PM Lee’s wife Ho Ching weirdly shares ar­ti­cle on cut­ting ties with fam­ily mem­bers”.</p>
    <p>“You had dipped your pen in poi</p>
    <p>son and you did so de­lib­er­ately,” said Mr Singh.</p>
    <p>“It was not, as you claimed, a mere re­port of the al­le­ga­tions... Isn’t it true that what you did was to use Ho Ching’s ar­ti­cle as a peg to cre­atively create this false at­tack?”</p>
    <p>Mr Singh fur­ther said that hav­ing been ac­cused ear­lier in a sep­a­rate suit – of al­leged defama­tion of the Cabi­net – Mr Xu saw Ms Ho’s ar­ti­cle, ti­tled “Here’s why some­times it is okay to cut ties with toxic fam­ily mem­bers”, as an op­por­tu­nity to at­tack the head of the Gov­ern­ment.</p>
    <p>Mr Xu dis­agreed.</p>
    <p>Mr Singh then re­ferred to lines in the TOC ar­ti­cle which read: “The irony of Madam Ho shar­ing the ar­ti­cle is what’s in­ter­est­ing and amus­ing to us. This is be­cause ev­ery­one knows that she has a</p>
    <p>sour re­la­tion­ship with her hus­band’s fam­ily mem­bers – par­tic­u­larly her brother-in-law Lee Hsien Yang (LHY) and sis­ter-in-law, Dr Lee Wei Ling (LWL).”</p>
    <p>He asked Mr Xu: “In your view, if this was ironic, could you tell us what you thought the irony was?”</p>
    <p>Mr Xu re­sponded: “The re­la­tion­ship be­tween Ms Ho Ching and her in-laws isn’t that good. Yet, she was shar­ing this post to say it is ad­vis­able to dis­tance from toxic rel­a­tives... The irony is that I feel she is the toxic fam­ily mem­ber.” “Oh, re­ally?” said Mr Singh. Jus­tice Au­drey Lim, among other things, asked: “Where is the irony...? Why is she deemed to be the toxic one when the rest of the para­graphs don’t talk about her?”</p>
    <p>Mr Xu replied that any reader with knowl­edge of the Lee fam­ily feud would com­pre­hend the irony of the mat­ter.</p>
    <p>Shortly af­ter Mr Xu pub­lished the ar­ti­cle, PM Lee, on Sept 1 last year, is­sued a let­ter of de­mand ask­ing TOC to re­move the of­fend­ing ar­ti­cle and as­so­ci­ated Face­book post, as well as apol­o­gise.</p>
    <p>On Sept 4, Mr Xu wrote back de­fend­ing the ar­ti­cle as “fair com­ment” and said it was his “moral obli­ga­tion to help dis­si­pate the cli­mate of fear that per­me­ates dis­course in Sin­ga­pore”.</p>
    <p>PM Lee sub­se­quently be­gan le­gal pro­ceed­ings, with his lawyers serv­ing Mr Xu a writ of sum­mons on Sept 5.</p>
    <p>Mr Singh asked Mr Xu why he had, on the same day, posted a photo of the writ on Face­book, and in­cluded a link to both PM Lee’s let­ter of de­mand and his own re­sponse of non-com­pli­ance.</p>
    <p>Mr Xu replied that it was nec­es­sary back­ground to ex­plain why he was be­ing sued and to in­di­cate he would not com­ment any fur­ther on the is­sue.</p>
    <p>Mr Singh also re­ferred to a Sept 6 TOC ar­ti­cle, which, among other things, had references to PM Lee’s on­go­ing li­bel suit against blog­ger Leong Sze Hian and his 2014 defama­tion suit against another blog­ger, Mr Roy Ngerng.</p>
    <p>Mr Xu said this was rea­son­able back­ground on PM Lee’s his­tory of su­ing in­di­vid­u­als, but Mr Singh coun­tered: “This was another at­tempt to make the point that this suit against you is in fur­ther­ance of the ‘cli­mate of fear’, as ev­i­dent from the other suits.”</p>
    <p>Both the Sept 5 Face­book post and Sept 6 ar­ti­cle were, Mr Singh con­cluded, ex­am­ples of Mr Xu op­por­tunis­ti­cally “at­tack­ing” PM Lee.</p>
    <p>Again, Mr Xu dis­agreed.</p>
