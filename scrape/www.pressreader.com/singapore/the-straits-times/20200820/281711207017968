    <p>Around 15,000 em­ploy­ers – or 78 per cent – have logged into the swab reg­is­tra­tion sys­tem since it was launched on Aug 1 to sched­ule their work­ers for ros­tered rou­tine test­ing (RRT).</p>
    <p>How­ever, there are still 118,000 work­ers who need to un­dergo RRT and have not yet been sched­uled, the Min­istry of Man­power (MOM) said late on Tues­day in a joint state­ment with the Build­ing and Con­struc­tion Author­ity, Eco­nomic Devel­op­ment Board and Health Pro­mo­tion Board.</p>
    <p>The au­thor­i­ties said that the RRT – con­ducted ev­ery 14 days – is for mi­grant work­ers liv­ing in dor­mi­to­ries, those work­ing on con­struc­tion or pro­duc­tion sites, and those in the con­struc­tion, marine and process sec­tors.</p>
    <p>MOM urged em­ploy­ers who have not sched­uled their work­ers, es­pe­cially those who stay at re­cently cleared dor­mi­to­ries, to do so quickly. It is plan­ning to up­date an ac­cess code sys­tem for work­ers such that those who are re­quired to un­dergo RRT but fail to do so will have a Red Ac­cessCode.</p>
    <p>Once work­ers have been sched­uled for their first RRT, they will be au­to­mat­i­cally as­signed new dates for fu­ture swabs.</p>
    <p>The min­istry ad­vised em­ploy­ers to sched­ule ap­point­ment slots for work­ers early so that they can se­cure a test­ing date at their pre­ferred lo­ca­tion.</p>
    <p>Em­ploy­ers should log into the swab reg­is­tra­tion sys­tem reg­u­larly to check if there are new work­ers whom they need to sched­ule ap­point­ments for, it said. The min­istry will add new work­ers to the sys­tem after their dor­mi­to­ries are cleared of the coro­n­avirus.</p>
