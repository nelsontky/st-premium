    <p>LONDON/BRUS­SELS • Bri­tish and Euro­pean Union ne­go­tia­tors met in Brus­sels yes­ter­day in a last-ditch at­tempt to strike a post-Brexit trade deal be­fore a tran­si­tion agree­ment ends on Dec 31.</p>
    <p>Bri­tish Prime Min­is­ter Boris John­son and Euro­pean Com­mis­sion Pres­i­dent Ur­sula von der Leyen spoke on Satur­day and in­structed their teams to re­sume talks af­ter they were paused on Fri­day.</p>
    <p>In a joint state­ment af­ter their call, Mr John­son and Ms von der Leyen said that no agree­ment was fea­si­ble if dis­agree­ments on the three thorny is­sues of gov­er­nance, fish­eries and com­pe­ti­tion rules, known as the level play­ing field, were not re­solved.</p>
    <p>“This is the fi­nal throw of the dice,” a Bri­tish source close to the ne­go­ti­a­tions said.</p>
    <p>EU Brexit ne­go­tia­tor Michel Barnier said the talks yes­ter­day with his Bri­tish coun­ter­part David Frost would show whether a new trade deal could be struck.</p>
    <p>A ma­jor­ity of Mr John­son’s min­is­ters are will­ing to back him if he de­cides a deal is not in Bri­tain’s in­ter­ests, the Times news­pa­per re­ported, saying 13 Cab­i­net min­is­ters – in­clud­ing eight who op­posed Brexit – had con­firmed they would do so.</p>
    <p>Bri­tish farming min­is­ter Ge­orge Eus­tice backed that up in an in­ter­view on Sky News yes­ter­day, saying the coun­try had done a huge amount of prepa­ra­tion for a no-deal out­come and was ready to go through with such a sce­nario.</p>
    <p>“We’ll con­tinue to work on these ne­go­ti­a­tions un­til there’s no point in do­ing so any fur­ther,” said Mr Eus­tice.</p>
    <p>But Ir­ish For­eign Min­is­ter Si­mon Coveney, a key fig­ure in Brexit talks in re­cent years, said it was not cred­i­ble for the Bri­tish gov­ern­ment to sug­gest they could man­age a no-deal.</p>
    <p>Strik­ing a more op­ti­mistic note, Mr Coveney said it was his “very strong view” that a deal could be done. “We are more likely to get a deal than not,” he told Ire­land’s Sunday In­de­pen­dent news­pa­per.</p>
    <p>Ne­go­ti­a­tions were paused on Fri­day af­ter hopes of a deal ear­lier in the week evap­o­rated.</p>
    <p>The Bri­tish team said the EU had made de­mands in­com­pat­i­ble with its sovereignt­y and warned that the talks could end with­out an agree­ment.</p>
    <p>Mr Coveney de­nied the EU had hard­ened its stance.</p>
    <p>If they fail to reach a deal, a five-year Brexit di­vorce will end mess­ily just as the United King­dom and its for­mer EU part­ners grap­ple with the eco­nomic cost of the Covid-19 pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Ex­perts have warned that a no-deal sce­nario would cause huge long-term dis­rup­tion to the Bri­tish economy.</p>
