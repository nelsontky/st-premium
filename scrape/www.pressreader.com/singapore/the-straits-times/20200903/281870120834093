    <p>BER­LIN • A critic of Pres­i­dent Vlad­mir Putin who fell into a coma in Rus­sia and is be­ing treated i n Ber­lin was poi­soned with a Sovi­et­de­vel­oped Novi­chok nerve agent, a Ger­man gov­ern­ment spokesman said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Tests on blood sam­ples con­ducted at a Ger­man mil­i­tary lab­o­ra­tory pro­duced “un­equiv­o­cal ev­i­dence” that Mr Alexei Navalny, Rus­sia’s most prom­i­nent op­po­si­tion fig­ure, had been poi­soned with Novi­chok, Mr St­ef­fen Seib­ert said in an e-mailed state­ment.</p>
    <p>A nerve agent of the same fam­ily was used two years ago to poi­son a Rus­sian de­fec­tor liv­ing in Bri­tain.</p>
    <p>“The fed­eral gov­ern­ment will in­form its part­ners in the EU and</p>
    <p>Nato of the re­sults of the in­ves­ti­ga­tion,” Mr Seib­ert added.</p>
    <p>“It will dis­cuss an ap­pro­pri­ate joint re­sponse with the part­ners in the light of the Rus­sian re­sponse.”</p>
    <p>Rus­sia is al­ready un­der West­ern sanc­tions af­ter its an­nex­a­tion of Crimea from Ukraine six years ago, and an­other stand-off with Euro­pean na­tions or the United States may hurt its econ­omy fur­ther.</p>
    <p>The Rus­sian rou­ble ex­tended losses against the euro af­ter the Ger­man gov­ern­ment state­ment.</p>
    <p>Mr Navalny, 44, fell ill af­ter board­ing a plane in Siberia last month and col­lapsed while fly­ing from the city of Tomsk to Moscow.</p>
    <p>He was ini­tially treated in a lo­cal hospi­tal be­fore be­ing air­lifted to</p>
    <p>Ger­many for treat­ment.</p>
    <p>The Charite hospi­tal in Ber­lin has re­ported “some im­prove­ment” in Mr Navalny’s con­di­tion but he nev­er­the­less re­mains in a med­i­cally in­duced coma and on a ven­ti­la­tor.</p>
    <p>Ger­man For­eign Minister Heiko Maas urged Rus­sia to in­ves­ti­gate Mr Navalny’s poi­son­ing now that clin­i­cal tests had shown he had been at­tacked with a nerve agent.</p>
    <p>Novi­chok is a deadly group of nerve agents de­vel­oped by the Soviet mil­i­tary in the 1970s and 1980s.</p>
    <p>Bri­tain says Rus­sia used Novi­chok to poi­son for­mer spy Sergei Skri­pal and his daugh­ter in the Bri­tish city of Sal­is­bury in 2018. Rus­sia has re­peat­edly de­nied any in­volve­ment in the at­tack, which the Skri­pals sur­vived. One mem­ber of the pub­lic was killed.</p>
    <p>“It is a shock­ing event that Alexei Navalny has be­come the vic­tim of an at­tack with a chem­i­cal nerve agent in Rus­sia,” Mr Seib­ert said.</p>
    <p>“The fed­eral gov­ern­ment con­demns this at­tack in the strongest terms.”</p>
