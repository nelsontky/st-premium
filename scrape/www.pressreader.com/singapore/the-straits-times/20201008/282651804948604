    <p>Aries (March 21 - April 19)</p>
    <p>You are get­ting closer to home base – ei­ther your trav­els are start­ing to wrap up or you are get­ting closer to your fam­ily. Smile and look ahead.</p>
    <p>Taurus (April 20 - May 20)</p>
    <p>Stretch your­self out and see if you can get peo­ple to fol­low. With a lit­tle com­mu­ni­ca­tion, you can get them to a place you can all be proud of.</p>
    <p>Gemini (May 21 - June 20)</p>
    <p>You can­not force your­self to ac­com­mo­date peo­ple, so do not make ex­cuses. Do your own thing and take care of your­self.</p>
    <p>Can­cer</p>
    <p>(June 21 - July 22)</p>
    <p>You need to han­dle some­one who is not be­ing straight with you, but your per­sonal and men­tal en­ergy can turn this dou­ble-speak into a win.</p>
    <p>Leo</p>
    <p>(July 23 - Aug 22)</p>
    <p>You want ev­ery­one to get along. Re­mind peo­ple that they should be in this to­gether and you should get your way in a few days.</p>
    <p>Virgo</p>
    <p>(Aug 23 - Sept 22)</p>
    <p>You need to help a friend in need – even if he got into this mess on his own. This is a time to en­able oth­ers’ bad be­hav­iour.</p>
    <p>Libra (Sept 23 - Oct 22)</p>
    <p>Your abil­ity to shift po­si­tions eas­ily helps you cope with big is­sues. It is a day for ne­go­ti­a­tion, as long as both par­ties are will­ing to com­pro­mise.</p>
    <p>Scorpio</p>
    <p>(Oct 23 - Nov 21)</p>
    <p>Your dreams of travel are get­ting stronger – so make plans or hit the road. Your spir­i­tual en­ergy helps you ab­sorb new sights and sounds.</p>
    <p>Sagittariu­s (Nov 22 - Dec 21)</p>
    <p>You and a friend are snip­ing at each other – but do not worry. You are just mis­matched for the time be­ing and things should be fine to­mor­row.</p>
    <p>Capricorn</p>
    <p>(Dec 22 - Jan 19)</p>
    <p>You may have to re­strain your­self from rolling your eyes, as peo­ple are se­ri­ously over­re­act­ing to a mi­nor bit of news. Let them have their drama.</p>
    <p>Aquarius</p>
    <p>(Jan 20 - Feb 18)</p>
    <p>Are you tak­ing your health se­ri­ously? You may get a wake-up call – but as long as you take care of it soon, all should be fine.</p>
    <p>Pisces</p>
    <p>(Feb 19 - March 20)</p>
    <p>Your po­etic sen­si­bil­i­ties are shin­ing through, so show some­one how you re­ally feel. It need not be ro­mance. Make a stand at work or with friends.</p>
