    <p>United States Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump (below) has walked back on his sug­ges­tion that the pres­i­den­tial elec­tion on Nov 3 be de­layed, af­ter both Repub­li­cans and Democrats re­jected the idea. Crit­ics and al­lies dis­missed the no­tion as an at­tempt to dis­tract from dev­as­tat­ing eco­nomic news. How­ever, Mr Trump re­mained con­cerned about mail-in bal­lots.</p>
    <p>• Hours af­ter sug­gest­ing a pos­si­ble de­lay in the US pres­i­den­tial elec­tion, Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump said he did not want to post­pone the vote but re­mained con­cerned about mil­lions of mailin bal­lots, as both Repub­li­cans and Democrats swiftly re­jected his idea of post­pon­ing the vote.</p>
    <p>Con­gress is the sole branch of gov­ern­ment with the au­thor­ity to make such a change.</p>
    <p>Crit­ics and even Mr Trump’s al­lies dis­missed the no­tion as a not se­ri­ous at­tempt to dis­tract from dev­as­tat­ing eco­nomic news.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump’s Twit­ter state­ment on Thurs­day came as the US is en­dur­ing a multi-pronged cri­sis: a coro­n­avirus pan­demic that has killed more than 155,000, a crip­pling re­ces­sion and na­tion­wide protests against po­lice vi­o­lence and racism.</p>
    <p>On Thurs­day morn­ing, the gov­ern­ment re­ported the worst eco­nomic con­trac­tion since it started keep­ing records in 1947, a record 32.9 per cent an­nu­alised pace in the sec­ond quar­ter.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump, who is trail­ing his Demo­cratic chal­lenger Joe Bi­den in opin­ion polls, said he would not trust the re­sults of an elec­tion that in­cluded wide­spread mail vot­ing – a move that many ob­servers see as crit­i­cal given the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>He also claimed, with­out ev­i­dence, that ramped-up mail vot­ing would be rife with fraud but praised ab­sen­tee vot­ing, which is also done by mail. “With Univer­sal Mail-In Vot­ing (not Ab­sen­tee Vot­ing, which is good), 2020 will be the most IN­AC­CU­RATE & FRAUD­U­LENT Elec­tion in his­tory. It will be a great em­bar­rass­ment to the USA,” he wrote on Twit­ter. “De­lay the Elec­tion un­til peo­ple can prop­erly, se­curely and safely vote???”</p>
    <p>At a White House news con­fer­ence later in the day, Mr Trump did not re­peat his call for a de­lay in the Nov 3 elec­tion, but said he was worried about fraud and a long wait for re­sults from count­ing mail bal­lots.</p>
    <p>“I want an elec­tion and a re­sult, much, much more than you,” he said. “I don’t want to de­lay.”</p>
    <p>“But I also don’t want to have to wait three months and then find out that the bal­lots are all miss­ing, and the elec­tion doesn’t mean any­thing,” he added.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump cited me­dia re­ports about po­ten­tial prob­lems with mail-in bal­lots ar­riv­ing late and said it could take weeks, months or even years to sort it out. “Do I want to see a date change? No, but I don’t want to see a crooked elec­tion,” he said.</p>
    <p>Some con­gres­sional Repub­li­cans – in­clud­ing Se­nate Ma­jor­ity Leader Mitch McCon­nell and top House of Rep­re­sen­ta­tives Repub­li­can Kevin McCarthy – re­jected the idea.</p>
    <p>“Never in the his­tory of the fed­eral elec­tions have we ever not held an elec­tion and we should go for­ward with our elec­tion,” said Mr McCarthy.</p>
    <p>Mr McCon­nell told WNKY tele­vi­sion: “Never in the his­tory of the coun­try – through wars, de­pres­sions and the Civil War – have we ever not had a fed­er­ally sched­uled elec­tion on time, and we’ll find a way to do that again this Nov 3.”</p>
    <p>Demo­cratic Rep­re­sen­ta­tive Zoe Lof­gren, who chairs the House com­mit­tee over­see­ing elec­tion se­cu­rity, said: “Un­der no cir­cum­stances will we con­sider do­ing so to ac­com­mo­date the Pres­i­dent’s in­ept and hap­haz­ard re­sponse to the coro­n­avirus pan­demic, or give cre­dence to the lies and mis­in­for­ma­tion he spreads.”</p>
    <p>A new Reuters/Ip­sos poll re­leased yes­ter­day showed Amer­i­cans across the po­lit­i­cal spec­trum have wide­spread con­cerns that the Nov 3 elec­tion will be marred by fraud, in­ter­fer­ence or ef­forts to sup­press the vote.</p>
    <p>About half of reg­is­tered vot­ers, in­clud­ing some 80 per cent of Repub­li­cans sur­veyed, are con­cerned that an in­crease in vot­ing by mail will lead to wide­spread fraud. This sug­gests a wide swathe of the US may have trou­ble ac­cept­ing the re­sult of the elec­tion.</p>
    <p>The poll, done on Wed­nes­day and Thurs­day par­tially be­fore Mr Trump’s tweet, also found nearly three-quar­ters were con­cerned about voter sup­pres­sion or pos­si­ble elec­tion in­ter­fer­ence.</p>
