    <p>A new coronaviru­s clus­ter in a Tuas for­eign worker dor­mi­tory was an­nounced by the Min­istry of Health (MOH) yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The dorm, SCM Tuas Lodge at 80 Tuas South Boule­vard, has two newly con­firmed Covid-19 pa­tients who were linked to three pre­vi­ous cases.</p>
    <p>MOH said yes­ter­day that there were 86 new coronaviru­s cases con­firmed as of noon, tak­ing Sin­ga­pore’s to­tal to 57,315.</p>
    <p>There were no new cases in the com­mu­nity. Of the 86 new in­fec­tions, 13 were im­ported cases.</p>
    <p>Three were Sin­ga­pore­ans and seven were per­ma­nent res­i­dents who re­turned to Sin­ga­pore sep­a­rately from Egypt on Aug 27, In­dia on Aug 28 and Aug 30, and the Philip­pines on Aug 30.</p>
    <p>Another two im­ported cases were de­pen­dant’s pass hold­ers who ar­rived sep­a­rately from In­dia on Aug 30 and the United States on the same day. The last pa­tient was a stu­dent’s pass holder who ar­rived from In­dia on Aug 30.</p>
    <p>There was ini­tially a 14th im­ported case an­nounced yes­ter­day af­ter­noon but later in the night, MOH said it re­moved this case af­ter in­ves­ti­ga­tions as the pa­tient pre­sented med­i­cal records which showed that she had ear­lier re­cov­ered from Covid-19 in­fec­tion and was no longer in­fec­tious.</p>
    <p>Mi­grant work­ers stay­ing in dor­mi­to­ries made up the re­main­ing 73 new coronaviru­s pa­tients an­nounced yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Among the 73 cases, 34 were iden­ti­fied as con­tacts of pre­vi­ous cases, and had al­ready been quar­an­tined to pre­vent fur­ther trans­mis­sion. They were tested dur­ing quar­an­tine to de­ter­mine their sta­tus.</p>
    <p>The re­main­ing 39 cases were de­tected through sur­veil­lance test­ing, such as ros­tered rou­tine test­ing of work­ers stay­ing in dor­mi­to­ries every fort­night.</p>
    <p>Thirty-three of the new pa­tients stay­ing in dorms were from Avery Lodge Dor­mi­tory in Jurong – a clus­ter which had a to­tal of 68 con­firmed cases as of yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The av­er­age num­ber of new daily cases in the com­mu­nity in a week has de­creased from three cases two weeks ago to two in the past week.</p>
    <p>The num­ber of un­linked cases in the com­mu­nity in a week has also de­creased from a daily av­er­age of two cases to one over the same pe­riod.</p>
    <p>With 49 cases dis­charged yes­ter­day, 56,592 pa­tients have fully re­cov­ered from the dis­ease.</p>
    <p>A to­tal of 49 pa­tients re­mained in hos­pi­tal yes­ter­day, with none in in­ten­sive care, while 632 were re­cu­per­at­ing in com­mu­nity fa­cil­i­ties.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore has had 27 deaths from Covid-19 com­pli­ca­tions, while 15 who tested pos­i­tive have died of other causes.</p>
