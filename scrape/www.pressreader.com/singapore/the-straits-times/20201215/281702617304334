    <p>Al­most half of mi­grant work­ers stay­ing in dor­mi­to­ries have had a Covid-19 in­fec­tion, the au­thor­i­ties said yesterday.</p>
    <p>As at Sun­day, 54,505 such work­ers have tested pos­i­tive for the virus via a poly­merase chain re­ac­tion (PCR) test.</p>
    <p>An­other 98,289 had a pos­i­tive re­sult from a serol­ogy test, which checks for a pre­vi­ous in­fec­tion.</p>
    <p>This means 152,794 work­ers in dorms have tested pos­i­tive in PCR or serol­ogy tests, or both.</p>
    <p>They form 47 per cent of the 323,000 dor­mi­tory dwellers in Singapore, said the Min­istry of Man­power (MOM) and the Min­istry of Health (MOH) in a joint state­ment.</p>
    <p>The min­istries added that serol­ogy tests for about 65,000 work­ers in dorms who had not taken them be­fore were still be­ing car­ried out. “This will give us the full pic­ture of the in­fec­tion preva­lence among our mi­grant work­ers,” they said.</p>
    <p>PCR tests are used to di­ag­nose cur­rent or new in­fec­tions. Serol­ogy tests iden­tify those who have been in­fected in the past, by de­tect­ing the pres­ence of Covid-19 an­ti­bod­ies in blood sam­ples.</p>
    <p>At a press con­fer­ence by the multi-min­istry task force on Covid-19 yesterday, Sec­ond Min­is­ter for Man­power Tan See Leng said the Gov­ern­ment’s test­ing and med­i­cal strat­egy had helped to achieve good health out­comes for mi­grant work­ers, with very low mor­bid­ity and mor­tal­ity rates among them.</p>
    <p>“It has also en­abled us to bet­ter un­der­stand the preva­lence of in­fec­tion amongst our mi­grant work­ers,” he added.</p>
    <p>“This will go a long way, in the com­ing months ahead, in in­form­ing us and al­low­ing us to re­fine our strate­gies to keep them safe against fu­ture out­breaks.”</p>
    <p>Dr Tan said Singapore has made sig­nif­i­cant strides since March, when the first Covid-19 in­fec­tions were de­tected in dorms.</p>
    <p>At the start of the out­break, the top pri­or­ity was to con­tain the spread of the virus, as well as take care of the health of those af­fected, he said.</p>
    <p>Once this was man­aged in early June, the fo­cus shifted to the clear­ing of work­ers and dorms so that re­cov­ered and in­fec­tion-free work­ers could re­sume work safely.</p>
    <p>By the end of May, the sci­en­tific lit­er­a­ture had high­lighted that a sig­nif­i­cant num­ber of those in­fected did not have symp­toms, but they still con­tributed to the spread of Covid-19.</p>
    <p>Lo­cal and in­ter­na­tional data also showed that those in­fected could con­tinue to shed non-in­fec­tious vi­ral frag­ments for up to sev­eral months, even af­ter re­cov­ery.</p>
    <p>There­fore, an even more com­pre­hen­sive test­ing strat­egy was needed to sep­a­rate work­ers who had never been in­fected, or had the virus ear­lier but were no longer in­fec­tious, from those cur­rently in­fected or har­bour­ing the virus with­out any symp­toms, Dr Tan said.</p>
    <p>“This was why we made the de­ci­sion to sys­tem­at­i­cally screen all mi­grant work­ers liv­ing in dor­mi­to­ries to al­low work­ers to re­turn to work quickly and safely,” he said, adding that a com­bi­na­tion of PCR and serol­ogy tests was used.</p>
    <p>By Au­gust, all mi­grant work­ers stay­ing in dor­mi­to­ries had been tested at least once for Covid-19. “This gave us the as­sur­ance that the vast ma­jor­ity of in­fec­tions have been con­tained,” said Dr Tan.</p>
    <p>Oct 13 was an­other sig­nif­i­cant mile­stone, as there were no new cases de­tected in dorms for the first time since March 25. He noted that new in­fec­tions in dorms have con­tin­ued to be low in the past two months.</p>
    <p>By early last month, more than 98 per cent of this pop­u­la­tion had been cleared to re­sume work.</p>
    <p>Dr Tan said the progress has been made pos­si­ble with the help of stake­hold­ers such as dor­mi­tory op­er­a­tors, em­ploy­ers and non-gov­ern­men­tal or­gan­i­sa­tions.</p>
    <p>He also cred­ited the nearly 3,000 of­fi­cers and vol­un­teers who formed an in­ter-agency task force to help with curb­ing the virus sit­u­a­tion in dorms, as well as the work­ers them­selves for their co­op­er­a­tion. “We could not have con­tained this virus with­out the de­ter­mi­na­tion, the co­op­er­a­tion, the pa­tience and the un­der­stand­ing of the mi­grant work­ers in the dor­mi­to­ries,” Dr Tan said.</p>
    <p>But with all the ef­forts in the past months, Singapore has “just reached base camp”, and the cri­sis is far from over.</p>
    <p>“We still have to scale the moun­tain peak in terms of en­sur­ing that as we open up safely, we will con­tinue to im­ple­ment a ro­bust and an in­clu­sive regime of vac­ci­na­tion and reg­u­lar test­ing for all of our mi­grant work­ers, i so­lat­ing and treat­ing the af­fected ones, and do­ing ag­gres­sive con­tact trac­ing while keep­ing the rest of us safe,” he added.</p>
    <p>MOM and MOH said the vast ma­jor­ity of mi­grant work­ers in dorms who tested PCR- or serol­ogy-pos­i­tive were asymp­to­matic or had very mild symp­toms, based on a study of work­ers in pur­pose-built dorms who tested pos­i­tive as at July 25.</p>
    <p>Only about one in five of mi­grant work­ers liv­ing in such dorms had symp­toms, with the re­main­ing dis­play­ing very mild or no symp­toms.</p>
    <p>The ra­tio of those who are PCR­pos­i­tive to serol­ogy-pos­i­tive is 1:1.8.</p>
    <p>This means that for ev­ery Covid-19 in­fec­tion in the dor­mi­to­ries de­tected through PCR test­ing, an­other 1.8 cases were untested and un­de­tected at the time, and were iden­ti­fied sub­se­quently only through serol­ogy test­ing.</p>
    <p>“This is not sur­pris­ing as many mi­grant work­ers did not have any symp­toms, and thus would not have sought treat­ment and re­ceived a PCR test in the process,” said the min­istries.</p>
    <p>The ra­tio of 1:1.8 is com­pa­ra­ble with the same ra­tio for the whole of South Korea, and lower than 1:4 in Spain and 1:15 in France, they said. “Our low ra­tio re­flects the ex­ten­sive test­ing that was car­ried out in dorms,” the min­istries added.</p>
    <p>When it comes to the re­port­ing of Covid-19 prac­tices, the min­istries said Singapore fol­lows the World Health Or­gan­i­sa­tion’s cri­te­rion that only pos­i­tive re­sults from PCR tests are in­cluded in the case count, which en­sures con­sis­tency in re­port­ing cases across coun­tries.</p>
    <p>But a dif­fer­ent ap­proach is taken for serol­ogy tests, which are used to aid epi­demi­o­log­i­cal in­ves­ti­ga­tions and to as­sess over­all preva­lence of in­fec­tion within a pop­u­la­tion.</p>
    <p>Most coun­tries do serol­ogy test­ing only on a sam­pling ba­sis, to es­ti­mate the preva­lence of in­fec­tions in a pop­u­la­tion, but Singapore went fur­ther to do serol­ogy tests on the en­tire pop­u­la­tion of mi­grant work­ers stay­ing in dor­mi­to­ries, the min­istries said.</p>
    <p>“This was a unique as­pect of our ef­forts to clear the dor­mi­to­ries of Covid-19,” they added.</p>
