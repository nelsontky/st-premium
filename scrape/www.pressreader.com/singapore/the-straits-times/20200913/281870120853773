    <p>US Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump has had sev­eral tell-all books writ­ten about him, but the fusil­lade he has faced in re­cent weeks, while con­firm­ing the worst fears and loathing of his crit­ics, has barely scratched the force shield of his core base.</p>
    <p>The books in­clude The Room Where It Hap­pened by his for­mer na­tional se­cu­rity ad­viser John Bolton; Too Much And Never Enough: How My Fam­ily Cre­ated The World’s Most Dan­ger­ous Man by his niece Mary L. Trump; and Dis­loyal: A Mem­oir by his for­mer lawyer Michael Co­hen.</p>
    <p>Po­lit­i­cally speak­ing, some of the mis­siles are big­ger than oth­ers.</p>
    <p>The White House is scram­bling to fight back against the lat­est – Rage, from a veteran jour­nal­ist and pierc­ing chron­i­cler of pres­i­dents, Mr Bob Wood­ward.</p>
    <p>Teas­ing ex­cerpts from the book due for of­fi­cial re­lease on Tues­day have been re­leased.</p>
    <p>Among the prin­ci­pal rev­e­la­tions are that Pres­i­dent Trump knew of the se­ri­ous­ness of the coro­n­avirus by Feb 7, but chose to down­play it to project an air of con­fi­dence rather than cause panic among the peo­ple.</p>
    <p>The result, how­ever, was that the pop­u­la­tion did not take it se­ri­ously enough. Lock­downs – the pre­ferred way to tackle the virus – came late. The ef­fi­cacy of wear­ing masks is still be­ing ar­gued.</p>
    <p>By last Fri­day night, the United States’ Covid-19 case toll had risen to 6.43 mil­lion, and al­most 192,000 peo­ple had died from the virus, ac­cord­ing to data main­tained by the New York Times.</p>
    <p>The rev­e­la­tion in Rage has res­ur­rected the is­sue of the pan­demic, dis­plac­ing the law and or­der nar­ra­tive that has been the re­cent fo­cus of Pres­i­dent Trump’s cam­paign.</p>
    <p>It has also given his ri­val Joe Biden am­mu­ni­tion to use against him.</p>
    <p>But ev­ery week brings new sen­sa­tional rev­e­la­tions, whether facts or al­le­ga­tions. And like many that have come and gone, Rage may well be wa­ter un­der the bridge in two or three weeks.</p>
    <p>Jour­nal­ist Michael Sch­midt’s book, Don­ald Trump V. The United States, re­leased on Sept 1, said that Vice-Pres­i­dent Mike Pence was put on standby alert dur­ing an ap­par­ently un­sched­uled visit by Pres­i­dent Trump to Wal­ter Reed hos­pi­tal – fu­elling ru­mours that the Pres­i­dent had a health episode.</p>
    <p>The rev­e­la­tion – shrugged off by Mr Pence – hogged the news cy­cle for a cou­ple of days be­fore be­ing sup­planted by some­thing new.</p>
    <p>Even Mr Co­hen’s tell-all book has fallen off the news cy­cle, re­placed by Mr Wood­ward’s book.</p>
    <p>“The caval­cade passes by so quickly it’s hard to gauge what longterm impact any rev­e­la­tions have,” New York Mag­a­zine colum­nist Frank Rich wrote on Wednesday.</p>
    <p>“By this late date, Trump’s in­dif­fer­ence to mat­ters of life and death has long since been baked into most vot­ers’ ver­dicts on this Pres­i­dent, in­clud­ing his own vot­ers,” he wrote.</p>
    <p>In­deed, an­a­lysts say there is noth­ing fun­da­men­tally new in the rev­e­la­tions in many of th­ese books.</p>
    <p>They merely con­firm what is gen­er­ally al­ready known or sur­mised.</p>
    <p>In the case of Rage, the Pres­i­dent sim­ply ac­knowl­edged that he had in­ten­tion­ally played down the deadly na­ture of the coro­n­avirus in an at­tempt to avoid a “frenzy”.</p>
    <p>And he skil­fully turned the spot­light back to Mr Wood­ward, ask­ing why the veteran jour­nal­ist had sat on the in­for­ma­tion for so long if he was con­cerned about the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>That trig­gered a de­bate about Mr Wood­ward with­hold­ing in­for­ma­tion for the sake of break­ing it out in a book.</p>
    <p>To do so is tempt­ing, to be sure. There is con­sid­er­able cash in th­ese book deals. Mr Bolton’s was re­port­edly worth US$2 mil­lion (S$2.74 mil­lion).</p>
    <p>A much ear­lier book, Fire And Fury: In­side The Trump White House by writer Michael Wolff, re­leased in 2018, de­buted at No. 1 on The New York Times best­seller list.</p>
    <p>Within a week, it had be­come the fastest-sell­ing book in the pub­lisher’s his­tory, with over 700,000 or­ders shipped and 1.4 mil­lion or­ders placed.</p>
    <p>Ms Trump’s tell-all mem­oir re­port­edly sold more than 1.35 mil­lion copies in its first week.</p>
    <p>And Mr Co­hen’s book de­buted at No. 1 on the Ama­zon best­seller list on the day of its re­lease on Sept 8.</p>
    <p>Pro-Trump books have also ap­peared. Live Free Or Die: Amer­ica (And The World) On The Brink by pro-Trump Fox News host Sean Han­nity landed on Ama­zon’s best­seller list as well.</p>
    <p>An ear­lier book by for­mer White House spokesman Sarah San­ders caused a brief stir when she re­vealed that North Korean leader Kim Jong Un winked at her dur­ing the June 2018 sum­mit in Sin­ga­pore with Pres­i­dent Trump.</p>
    <p>But a few weeks later, that has also been for­got­ten.</p>
    <p>Rage will un­doubt­edly notch up colossal fig­ures. But whether it will sway the Nov 3 pres­i­den­tial elec­tion is doubt­ful.</p>
    <p>“One or two weeks from now, there will be a new rev­e­la­tion and the pub­lic will have for­got­ten about it,” a for­eign am­bas­sador in Wash­ing­ton told The Sun­day Times on con­di­tion of anonymity. “Trump just keeps mov­ing for­ward.”</p>
    <p>HARD TO AS­SESS IMPACT</p>
    <p>The caval­cade passes by so quickly it’s hard to gauge what long-term impact any rev­e­la­tions have.</p>
    <p>MR FRANK RICH, New York Mag­a­zine colum­nist, on the slew of tell-all books on US Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump.</p>
    <p>An­a­lysts say there is noth­ing fun­da­men­tally new in the rev­e­la­tions in many of th­ese books. In the case of Rage, the Pres­i­dent... skil­fully turned the spot­light back to writer Bob Wood­ward, ask­ing why the veteran jour­nal­ist had sat on the in­for­ma­tion for so long if he was con­cerned about the pan­demic.</p>
