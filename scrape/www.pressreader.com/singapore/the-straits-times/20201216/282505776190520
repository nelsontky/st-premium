    <p>What is your se­cret to look­ing fab­u­lous?</p>
    <p>Strength and con­fi­dence.</p>
    <p>Has there ever been a time when you were not fit and fab?</p>
    <p>Yes, af­ter two knee op­er­a­tions in Fe­bru­ary and Septem­ber last year due to wear and tear from muay thai. I had sus­tained mul­ti­ple lig­a­ment tears in my right knee that needed two re­con­struc­tions and I was in crutches for a while that were lim­it­ing, not only phys­i­cally but men­tally.</p>
    <p>It led to emo­tional eat­ing and weight gain, but I am in a bet­ter place now with a new per­spec­tive on life and com­ing out stronger than be­fore.</p>
    <p>What is your diet like?</p>
    <p>80/20 – 80 be­ing whole foods such as fish, chicken, beef and mixed salad, and 20 be­ing any­thing else I want.</p>
    <p>What are your in­dul­gences?</p>
    <p>Loaves of sweet bread in flavours such as choco­late chip and but­ter­scotch and sweet pas­tries.</p>
    <p>How do you main­tain a healthy work-life bal­ance?</p>
    <p>I take ex­er­cise and out­door breaks in be­tween work ses­sions. I en­joy feel­ing the sun on my skin.</p>
    <p>What are the three most im­por­tant things in your life?</p>
    <p>Fam­ily, men­tal health and love.</p>
    <p>What is your favourite and least favourite part of your body?</p>
    <p>As an il­lus­tra­tor, my favourite would be my hands be­cause they help me il­lus­trate. Workout-wise, they help me grip the bars when I do my pull-ups.</p>
    <p>My least favourite is cur­rently my right knee that isn’t at 100 per cent af­ter two op­er­a­tions, but I’m work­ing hard on it and learn­ing to love it more.</p>
    <p>What are your must-dos be­fore and af­ter a workout?</p>
    <p>My must-do be­fore a workout is mo­bil­ity drill ex­er­cises, such as crab reaches and straight leg bear crawl to stay func­tional and strong in all ranges of move­ment, and a good meal post-workout.</p>
    <p>How im­por­tant is it for you to keep up with your fit­ness rou­tine?</p>
    <p>Ex­tremely. I’m one of those peo­ple who need to be on the move and stay ac­tive. It keeps me grounded and in a good men­tal space.</p>
    <p>A fit­ness rou­tine doesn’t have to be a strict reg­i­men and should en­com­pass dif­fer­ent ac­tiv­i­ties like cy­cling and tak­ing walks.</p>
    <p>What are the changes you have made to keep ex­er­cis­ing dur­ing this time?</p>
    <p>I was fairly fresh out of my sec­ond knee surgery and was re­liant on the ma­chines in the gym for re­ha­bil­i­ta­tion and strength build­ing from mus­cle at­ro­phy.</p>
    <p>I be­gan fo­cus­ing on bet­ter move­ment, mo­bil­ity and body-weight ex­er­cises. Ac­count­abil­ity is key to keep­ing up and I am blessed with a great sup­port sys­tem – friends with sim­i­lar goals to push each other through the chang­ing times.</p>
    <p>How has your ac­tive lifestyle in­flu­enced your fam­ily and friends?</p>
    <p>I have de­vel­oped stronger re­la­tion­ships with friends and fam­ily and built lit­tle com­mu­ni­ties of sup­port.</p>
    <p>What is the most ex­treme thing you have done in the name of fit­ness?</p>
    <p>A weight loss of about 6 to 8kg be­fore a muay thai fight that led me to be­ing weak and de­hy­drated.</p>
    <p>How ex­ten­sive is your col­lec­tion of sports-re­lated para­pher­na­lia? Not at all. Would you go for plas­tic surgery?</p>
    <p>No. Do you think you’re sexy? My friends think so. am­ri­tak@sph.com.sg</p>
