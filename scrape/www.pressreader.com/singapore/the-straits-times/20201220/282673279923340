    <p>1. MONTHLY SAV­INGS</p>
    <p>UOB head of group per­sonal fi­nan­cial ser­vices Jacquelyn Tan ad­vises a 50-30-20 rule when it comes to sav­ing and spend­ing.</p>
    <p>This means 50 per cent is for es­sen­tial ex­penses such as food and health­care, 30 per cent is saved or in­vested, and 20 per cent is for other gen­eral ex­pen­di­ture.</p>
    <p>“As a gen­eral rule, your sav­ings should cover all your per­sonal ex­penses for at least six months. This will give you suf­fi­cient time to ad­just your com­mit­ments with­out the ad­di­tional fi­nan­cial and men­tal pres­sures that come from liv­ing from one salary to an­other,” she says.</p>
    <p>“Your sav­ings should also sup­port your short to midterm goals. This means that if you are plan­ning to spend a large sum of money within the next five years for a spe­cific pur­pose, such as mar­riage or buy­ing your first home, you should save reg­u­larly for this.”</p>
    <p>Ms Lim Bee Bee, DBS Con­sumer Bank­ing Group (Sin­ga­pore) head of mar­ket­ing and cus­tomer man­age­ment, says: “Go back to ba­sics: Al­ways put aside in­come for sav­ings first be­fore other obli­ga­tions. Au­tomat­ing your sav­ings with stand­ing in­struc­tions ev­ery month helps.”</p>
    <p>2. BUILD AN EMER­GENCY FUND</p>
    <p>OCBC Bank head of de­posits Gregory Cher ad­vises: “Sav­ing up and en­sur­ing you have suf­fi­cient emer­gency funds to last you at least six to 12 months is of paramount im­por­tance to help tide you through a cri­sis. Our Save bonus in­ter­est nudges cus­tomers in this di­rec­tion, pro­vid­ing a re­ward to cus­tomers for build­ing up their sav­ings of at least $500 a month,” he says.</p>
    <p>Ms Lim from DBS rec­om­mends a cash-flow tracker, such as the DBS Nav Plan­ner that is open to non-DBS cus­tomers.</p>
    <p>Such a plan­ner will help cus­tomers to un­der­stand their key in­come flows and ex­pen­di­ture, as well as set a re­al­is­tic bud­get and sort out their spend­ing au­to­mat­i­cally into cat­e­gories such as shop­ping, util­i­ties and food.</p>
    <p>“Make it a pri­or­ity to in­sure against the ‘what ifs’ fi­nan­cially, to min­imise dip­ping into emer­gency sav­ings dur­ing un­fore­seen cir­cum­stances,” she says.</p>
    <p>“Any ex­cess funds you save be­yond your emer­gency sav­ings thresh­old should go to­wards pro­tec­tion and in­vest­ment to help grow your money.”</p>
    <p>3. IN­VEST</p>
    <p>Ms Tan from UOB says that while sav­ings are im­por­tant, cus­tomers can also have a holis­tic fi­nan­cial plan and grow their fi­nan­cial as­sets through in­vest­ment.</p>
    <p>“The key is to re­view your in­vest­ment port­fo­lio reg­u­larly to en­sure that it continues to be rel­e­vant to your goals and ob­jec­tives through­out your dif­fer­ent life stages and fi­nan­cial cir­cum­stances,” she said.</p>
