    <p>LYON (France) • Den­mark’s Soren Kragh An­der­sen timed his ef­fort to per­fec­tion to win the 14th stage of the Tour de France, a 194.5km ride from Cler­mont-Fer­rand yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The Team Sun­web rider at­tacked with just un­der three kilo­me­tres to go and never looked back as Slove­nian Luka Mezgec took sec­ond place and Ital­ian Si­mone Con­sonni came home third, both 15 sec­onds be­hind.</p>
    <p>“I have no words, I feel very emo­tional. I’ve dreamed about this but it’s hard to say you’re good enough un­til you do it. I’m amazed,” An­der­sen said.</p>
    <p>“I had re­ally good legs the whole day but you never know how good the other guys are.</p>
    <p>“It took me a long time in the Tour to get con­fi­dence in my­self. But I knew if I was suf­fer­ing, then they were suf­fer­ing.”</p>
    <p>Slove­nian Pri­moz Roglic re­tained the over­all leader’s yel­low jer­sey ahead of to­day’s 15th stage, a 174.5km moun­tain trek end­ing up the Col du Grand Colom­bier.</p>
    <p>The Jumbo-Visma leader stays 44 sec­onds ahead of com­pa­triot and UAE Team Emi­rates rider Tadej Po­gacar, while de­fend­ing cham­pion Egan Ber­nal of Ineos Grenadiers is third, a fur­ther 15 sec­onds be­hind.</p>
    <p>How­ever, 2012 Tour win­ner Bradley Wig­gins claimed that the Colom­bian was “not done yet” with seven stages left.</p>
    <p>Sep­a­rately, French rider Ro­main Bardet from AG2R Mon­di­ale yes­ter­day re­vealed on his In­sta­gram page that he suf­fered a small haem­or­rhage, fol­low­ing a con­cus­sion that forced him to pull out of the Tour the pre­vi­ous day.</p>
    <p>Race chief doc­tor Florence Pom­merie, how­ever, de­fended the de­ci­sion to al­low him to fin­ish the 13th stage, say­ing: “You’re al­ways a bit dizzy when you crash at 40 or 80kmh.</p>
    <p>“We didn’t pre­vent him from rac­ing be­cause he was show­ing no clin­i­cal signs of a con­cus­sion.”</p>
