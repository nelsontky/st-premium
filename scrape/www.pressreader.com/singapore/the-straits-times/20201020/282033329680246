    <p>A vac­cine for a highly con­ta­gious dis­ease that is deadly to rab­bits is now avail­able in Singapore.</p>
    <p>A clus­ter of 11 rab­bits in­fected with rab­bit haem­or­rhagic dis­ease (RHD) was de­tected here on Sept 16, and eight of them have died.</p>
    <p>The dis­ease’s mor­tal­ity rate is be­tween 90 per cent and 100 per cent, but it is not trans­mis­si­ble from an­i­mals to people and does not af­fect other an­i­mal species.</p>
    <p>It is trans­mit­ted be­tween rab­bits through direct con­tact with in­fected flu­ids, fur and car­casses. Trans­mis­sion through in­sects and ob­jects such as shoes, cloth­ing and equip­ment has also been recorded.</p>
    <p>No new cases of the dis­ease have been de­tected since Sept 17, said the Na­tional Parks Board’s An­i­mal and Vet­eri­nary Ser­vice (AVS) last Wed­nes­day in re­sponse to queries from The Straits Times.</p>
    <p>“The spread of the dis­ease has been very lim­ited within the com­mu­nity due to the vig­i­lance of vet­eri­nar­i­ans and hy­giene pro­to­cols im­ple­mented by stake­hold­ers in the pet rab­bit com­mu­nity,” said Dr Chang Siow Foong, AVS group di­rec­tor of pro­fes­sional and sci­en­tific ser­vices.</p>
    <p>The vac­cine, Filavac VHD K, was made avail­able in Singapore last Thurs­day, said vet­eri­nary clinic</p>
    <p>The An­i­mal Doc­tors.</p>
    <p>It costs be­tween $86 and $110 for rab­bits to get vac­ci­nated.</p>
    <p>The vac­cine is ad­min­is­tered as an in­jec­tion and takes ef­fect af­ter seven days, but it will not work if the rab­bit has al­ready been in­fected with the virus.</p>
    <p>Dr Sarah Wong, a vet at Mount Pleas­ant Vet Cen­tre, urged rab­bit own­ers to get their pets vac­ci­nated.</p>
    <p>“The virus is very con­ta­gious and can sur­vive for about 100 days on var­i­ous sur­faces. It also has an ex­tremely high fa­tal­ity rate,” she said.</p>
    <p>House­wife Tracy Toh, 34, got her rab­bit, a hol­land lop named Baby Candy, vac­ci­nated two days ago.</p>
    <p>“We wanted to get her vac­ci­nated be­cause her i mmune sys­tem is weaker (com­pared with) other rab­bits. She had a bad bout of flu awhile back (and it) took six weeks (for her) to re­cover, so we didn’t want to take any chances as RHD’s mor­tal­ity rate is very high,” she said.</p>
