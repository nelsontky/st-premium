    <p>There were six new coro­n­avirus cases con­firmed yes­ter­day, tak­ing Sin­ga­pore’s to­tal to 57,921.</p>
    <p>They in­cluded two from work­ers’ dor­mi­to­ries, said the Min­istry of Health yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>There were also four im­ported cases, who had been placed on stay-home no­tices upon ar­rival in Sin­ga­pore. All of them were asymp­to­matic and con­firmed to have the virus on Mon­day.</p>
    <p>They com­prised a Sin­ga­porean, a per­ma­nent res­i­dent and two work pass hold­ers.</p>
    <p>The Sin­ga­porean is a 35-year-old man who re­turned from In­done­sia, while the per­ma­nent res­i­dent is a 41-year-old woman who re­turned from In­dia.</p>
    <p>One of the work pass hold­ers is a 43-year-old Egyp­tian male na­tional who re­turned from the United Arab Emi­rates.</p>
    <p>The other work pass holder, a 37-year-old Ger­man male na­tional, re­turned from Ger­many.</p>
    <p>There were no new com­mu­nity cases an­nounced yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Mi­grant work­ers stay­ing in dor­mi­to­ries made up the re­main­ing two new coro­n­avirus pa­tients.</p>
    <p>One of the two mi­grant work­ers was iden­ti­fied as a con­tact of pre­vi­ous cases and had al­ready been quar­an­tined. He was tested while quar­an­tined, the min­istry said.</p>
    <p>The other case was de­tected through the min­istry’s ros­tered rou­tine test­ing of work­ers stay­ing in dor­mi­to­ries ev­ery fort­night.</p>
    <p>The num­ber of new cases in the com­mu­nity has in­creased from two cases in the week be­fore to four in the past week, the min­istry added.</p>
    <p>The num­ber of un­linked cases in the com­mu­nity has in­creased from no cases in the week be­fore to two cases in the past week.</p>
    <p>In all, 57,804 pa­tients have fully re­cov­ered from the disease.</p>
    <p>A to­tal of 38 pa­tients re­main in hos­pi­tal while 36 are re­cu­per­at­ing in com­mu­nity fa­cil­i­ties. None is in in­ten­sive care.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore has had 28 deaths from Covid-19 com­pli­ca­tions, while 15 who tested pos­i­tive have died of other causes.</p>
