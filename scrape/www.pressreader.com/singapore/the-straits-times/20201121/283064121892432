    <p>LOS AN­GE­LES • Os­car-win­ning ac­tor Matthew McConaughe­y (left) may be the next celebrity to throw his hat into the po­lit­i­cal ring.</p>
    <p>The star of sci­ence-fic­tion film Con­tact and com­edy drama Magic Mike ap­peared to be con­sid­er­ing the idea when dis­cussing pol­i­tics with syn­di­cated talk ra­dio host Hugh He­witt i n an in­ter­view posted on­line on Wed­nes­day.</p>
    <p>Asked if he would run for gover­nor of Texas or an­other po­lit­i­cal of­fice, the ac­tor said he was un­de­cided with­out rul­ing it out.</p>
    <p>McConaughe­y, 51, was born and raised in Texas be­fore mov­ing to Los An­ge­les and forg­ing a ca­reer in ro­man­tic come­dies such as How To Lose A Guy In 10 Days (2003).</p>
    <p>“I mean, that wouldn’t be up to me. It would be up to the peo­ple more than it would me,” said McConaughe­y.</p>
    <p>“I would say this,” he con­tin­ued. “Look, pol­i­tics seems to be a bro­ken busi­ness to me right now. And when pol­i­tics re­de­fines its pur­pose, I could be a lot more in­ter­ested.”</p>
    <p>In the in­ter­view, he de­scribed his po­lit­i­cal phi­los­o­phy as be­ing “be­hind per­sonal val­ues to re­bind our so­cial con­tracts with one an­other as Amer­i­cans”.</p>
    <p>How­ever, he seemed some way from hav­ing made any de­ci­sion to swop act­ing for pol­i­tics.</p>
    <p>“I still ques­tion how much you can re­ally get done in pol­i­tics and I don’t know if pol­i­tics is my av­enue to get what maybe I am best equipped to get done,” he said.</p>
    <p>He ap­peared on The Late Show With Stephen Col­bert on Thurs­day night to dis­cuss the same topic and said: “I have no plans to do that right now.”</p>
    <p>How­ever, he added: “As I move for­ward in life, yes, I’m gonna con­sider lead­er­ship roles where I can be most use­ful.”</p>
    <p>He still has time to come to a de­ci­sion as the next Texas gover­nor elec­tion is in 2022. The cur­rent gover­nor is Greg Ab­bott.</p>
    <p>How­ever, Tex­ans have al­ready taken to Twit­ter to voice their sup­port for McConaughe­y.</p>
    <p>“I don’t see why not. I trust McConaughe­y more than I do Ab­bott,” wrote Twit­ter user ChibiReave­r.</p>
    <p>An­other Twit­ter user, Lo­ri­lyn­nFer­gus1, wrote: “I agree he can get way more done as him­self than he prob­a­bly could as gover­nor. I’m a Texas na­tive. Yes, I would vote for him.”</p>
    <p>User Htcj28 said: “Please, please run for Texas gover­nor. You’d have my fam­ily’s votes.”</p>
    <p>McConaughe­y, who won an Os­car for his role in 2013 Aids drama Dal­las Buy­ers Club, would be­come one of a se­ries of celebri­ties who have flirted with or won po­lit­i­cal of­fice in the United States.</p>
    <p>They in­clude pres­i­dents Don­ald Trump and the late Ron­ald Rea­gan, for­mer Cal­i­for­nia gover­nor Arnold Sch­warzeneg­ger, for­mer Carmel mayor Clint East­wood and for­mer Min­nesota gover­nor Jesse Ven­tura.</p>
