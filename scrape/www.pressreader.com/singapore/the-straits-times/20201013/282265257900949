    <p>• With Kylian Mbappe and Cris­tiano Ron­aldo squar­ing off, the first meet­ing be­tween France and Por­tu­gal since the Euro 2016 fi­nal had been ex­pected to be goals ga­lore.</p>
    <p>Ex­cept that the Na­tions League A Group 3 clash on Sun­day turned out to be a damp squib.</p>
    <p>World cham­pi­ons France drew 0-0 at home to Euro­pean ti­tle hold­ers Por­tu­gal in a cagey meet­ing at the Stade de France which failed to live up to its billing.</p>
    <p>The paucity of chances meant ei­ther side could only man­age one shot on tar­get in the first half and it was a game in which both de­fences came out tops.</p>
    <p>Ron­aldo came clos­est to scor­ing in added time when his de­flected shot was well saved by Hugo Lloris as the Por­tu­gal cap­tain failed to add to his 101 goals for his coun­try, just eight shy of the all-time in­ter­na­tional record held by Iran great Ali Daei.</p>
    <p>Right-back Nel­son Semedo said: “We have to be cautious in games like this.”</p>
    <p>Por­tu­gal coach Fer­nando San­tos added: “We didn’t score a goal but we weren’t here to score goals... It’s not al­ways pos­si­ble to cre­ate op­por­tu­ni­ties.”</p>
    <p>Les Bleus were equally cautious, with coach Di­dier Deschamps say­ing: “We can al­ways do bet­ter, but given the qual­ity of the op­po­nent we took pre­cau­tions and we did not see much of Ron­aldo this evening.</p>
    <p>“Our at­tack­ers strug­gled, some­times, our move­ment was not good, at other moments, we could not make the fi­nal pass.”</p>
    <p>Only nine play­ers who started that show­piece game in 2016 fea­tured in Sun­day’s match, while only 1,000 fans were per­mit­ted in­side the 80,000-ca­pac­ity ground.</p>
    <p>Else­where in France’s group, World Cup fi­nal­ists Croa­tia nabbed their first win of the Na­tions League cam­paign with a 2-1 home vic­tory over bot­tom side Swe­den, thanks to Nikola Vla­sic and An­drej Kra­maric.</p>
    <p>In Group 1, Italy coach Roberto Mancini fumed over the “very bad” pitch af­ter his team were held to a 0-0 draw at Poland.</p>
    <p>The Azzurri, how­ever, ex­tended their un­beaten run to 18 matches as they re­mained one point ahead of the Nether­lands, with new coach Frank de Boer still search­ing for his first win af­ter his sec­ond game in charge ended in a goal-less away draw with Bos­nia.</p>
