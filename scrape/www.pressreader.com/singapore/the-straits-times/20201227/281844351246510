    <p>A top gam­ing ex­ec­u­tive and movie pro­ducer died on Christ­mas Day af­ter he was be­lieved to have been poi­soned by a col­league.</p>
    <p>He was 39.</p>
    <p>It was a tragic conclusion to a bizarre se­quence of events in­volv­ing the worlds of movies, gam­ing and in­vest­ment that has kept Chi­nese ne­ti­zens riv­eted.</p>
    <p>Last Wed­nes­day, po­lice in Shang­hai re­leased a state­ment say­ing Yoozoo Games founder Lin Qi had been in hos­pi­tal since Dec 16, af­ter a sus­pected murder at­tempt by a co-worker. De­tails were scant but he was be­lieved to have been poi­soned.</p>
    <p>One of his col­leagues, who was iden­ti­fied only by his sur­name Xu, was in po­lice cus­tody pend­ing fur­ther in­ves­ti­ga­tion.</p>
    <p>Be­fore his death, Mr Lin and a movie pro­duc­tion arm of Yoozoo had been in­volved in work on a film adap­ta­tion of the pop­u­lar scifi se­ries Three Body Prob­lem for stream­ing gi­ant Net­flix.</p>
    <p>Yoozoo re­leased its own state­ment, say­ing Mr Lin had ad­mit­ted him­self to hos­pi­tal af­ter feel­ing un­well but was in a sta­ble con­di­tion.</p>
    <p>Things took a dra­matic turn on Fri­day when the com­pany an­nounced its founder had died.</p>
    <p>“Good­bye youth,” it wrote in an an­nounce­ment posted on its of­fi­cial Weibo mi­croblog.</p>
    <p>The term “youth” is in ref­er­ence to the word that is in sev­eral of the com­pany’s hit games.</p>
    <p>“We will be to­gether, con­tinue to be kind, con­tinue to be­lieve in good­ness, and con­tinue the fight against all that is bad,” Yoozoo wrote.</p>
    <p>The post at­tracted thou­sands of com­ments, most ex­press­ing their con­do­lences, while the topic has been viewed more than 290 mil­lion times on the Weibo so­cial me­dia plat­form.</p>
    <p>Many of the tributes fea­tured cal­lig­ra­phy, a nod to the man who was an avid cal­lig­ra­pher and po­etry en­thu­si­ast.</p>
    <p>Af­ter the news broke, staff and for­mer em­ploy­ees gath­ered out­side Yoozoo’s Shang­hai of­fice to mourn his death.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to lo­cal me­dia re­ports, the per­son in cus­tody could be Mr Xu Yao, who heads the com­pany’s movie pro­duc­tion arm.</p>
    <p>It was re­ported that the poi­son may have been ad­min­is­tered in aged pu’er tea.</p>
    <p>China Eco­nomic Weekly, a magazine linked to the of­fi­cial Peo­ple’s Daily, said Mr Lin had been poi­soned via med­i­ca­tion.</p>
    <p>The dis­agree­ment had stemmed from a work dis­pute, the magazine re­ported, with Mr Lin choos­ing to slash Mr Xu’s pay in a bid to force him out of the com­pany.</p>
    <p>In China’s highly lu­cra­tive gam­ing sec­tor, Mr Lin was a ris­ing star.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to the Hu­run China Rich List, he had a net worth es­ti­mated at 6.8 bil­lion yuan (S$1.4 bil­lion).</p>
    <p>Founded in 2009, the com­pany has had sev­eral hits in the do­mes­tic mar­ket. It is best known in­ter­na­tion­ally for de­vel­op­ing Game Of Thrones: Win­ter Is Com­ing, a multi-plat­form game based on the hit HBO se­ries.</p>
    <p>The Shen­zhen-listed firm was among the ear­li­est Chi­nese gamemak­ers to ex­pand glob­ally.</p>
    <p>Fi­nan­cial re­sults show that in the first half of this year, nearly half of the firm’s rev­enue came from out­side China.</p>
    <p>The com­pany has also been closely linked to Three Body Prob­lem, a tril­ogy by Chi­nese writer Liu Cixin, be­cause it holds rights for the books’ film adap­ta­tion.</p>
    <p>But since ac­quir­ing the rights in 2014, work on the pro­duc­tion has been slow.</p>
    <p>In Septem­ber, the com­pany said it had granted Net­flix the right to adapt the books for tele­vi­sion.</p>
