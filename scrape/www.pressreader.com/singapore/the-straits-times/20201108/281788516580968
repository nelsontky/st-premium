    <p>After many months of not cruis­ing, there were scenes of de­light and even teary eyes among pas­sen­gers and crew on Sin­ga­pore’s first pan­demic cruise to nowhere.</p>
    <p>The World Dream mega ship set sail on Fri­day night with 1,400 pas­sen­gers, cruis­ing un­der new Covid-19 pro­to­cols.</p>
    <p>Busi­ness­man Andy Hoon, 40, treated his daugh­ter to the twonight get­away as a gift after she com­pleted her PSLE ex­ams.</p>
    <p>“She is en­joy­ing ev­ery mo­ment,” he said. With their but­ler, she planned an itin­er­ary that in­cluded shows and vir­tual games.</p>
    <p>Cruises are al­lowed to op­er­ate at 50 per cent ca­pac­ity for Sin­ga­pore res­i­dents and he liked the greater pri­vacy. His daugh­ter en­joyed ex­tra at­ten­tion dur­ing a Christ­mas dec­o­ra­tion class, for in­stance.</p>
    <p>He has no anx­i­ety about pan­demic cruis­ing as he is a vet­eran of al­most 20 cruises.</p>
    <p>He used to travel four or five times a year and not glo­be­trot­ting for so long had felt “night­mar­ish”, so the cruise was an op­por­tu­nity to get out of the city and savour father-daugh­ter time, he said.</p>
    <p>Be­fore the new gov­ern­ment pi­lot in­volv­ing World Dream for cruis­ing to re­sume with strict safe man­age­ment mea­sures in place, cruise ships had not been al­lowed to call here since March 13 over Covid-19 fears.</p>
    <p>Pro­duc­tion man­ager Leonardo de Souza Martins, 30, who works with the ship’s en­ter­tain­ment team, said emo­tions surged after stag­ing the Verry Christ­mas show for a live au­di­ence. “I was in tears yes­ter­day. It was su­per nos­tal­gic, hav­ing guests again and do­ing what we love,” said the Brazil­ian.</p>
    <p>The per­for­mance was staged in the 999-seat Zo­diac Theatre, but guests were capped at 250 and safely dis­tanced in five zones.</p>
    <p>After the show, some guests were “teary-eyed” after a long sea­son of lit­tle en­ter­tain­ment and they thanked the cast, said cruise di­rec­tor Shari Faye Lamela, 29.</p>
    <p>Gent­ing Cruise Lines is hir­ing more than 100 Sin­ga­pore­ans, as it restarts cruises. This is also a bid to sup­port the lo­cal econ­omy dur­ing the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Po­si­tions in­clude ma­rine of­fi­cers, gal­ley chefs, se­cu­rity of­fi­cers and hospi­tal­ity staff.</p>
    <p>Among the new join­ers is sec­ond of­fi­cer Zachary Loh, 30, who started work this month.</p>
    <p>“This is a cov­eted job. 2020 is a year of break­ing glass ceil­ings,” said Mr Loh, a Sin­ga­porean who worked for 12 years on com­mer­cial ships. Cruise lines tra­di­tion­ally tend to hire in­ter­na­tional crew.</p>
