    <p>NEW YORK • The re­la­tion­ship be­tween the United States Olympic and Par­a­lympic Com­mit­tee (USOPC) and its most dec­o­rated Olympian, Michael Phelps, has been rocky for years.</p>
    <p>The more Phelps won, rack­ing up 28 Olympic medals across five Games, the more he be­came its poster child, wor­thy of what­ever spe­cial treat­ment it could pro­vide.</p>
    <p>Or, from Phelps’ per­spec­tive, he was the lat­est and great­est com­mod­ity that Olympic pro­mot­ers cared about only as a medal-pro­duc­ing swim­ming ma­chine.</p>
    <p>He dis­tils that dy­namic near the end of The Weight Of Gold, the HBO Sports doc­u­men­tary he nar­rates about de­pres­sion and other men­tal ill­nesses with which Olympians strug­gle. He is also an ex­ec­u­tive pro­ducer of the film, which pre­miered on Wednes­day.</p>
    <p>“I can hon­estly say, look­ing back on my ca­reer, I don’t think any­body re­ally cared to help us,” the 23-time Olympic cham­pion says. “As long as we were per­form­ing, I don’t think any­thing else re­ally mat­tered.”</p>
    <p>In re­cent weeks, as they have braced for crit­i­cism, Olympic of­fi­cials past and present have noted all the perks Phelps re­ceived dur­ing his ca­reer, in­clud­ing top train­ing and coach­ing, ac­cess to cut­ting-edge tech­nol­ogy and a twobed­room suite at the Olympic</p>
    <p>Train­ing Cen­tre in Colorado Springs. Every­one else slept in sin­gle or dou­ble rooms.</p>
    <p>But that un­even treat­ment and re­sponse to the film, Phelps said, il­lus­trates how of­fi­cials and coaches view ath­letes as as­sets dur­ing their brief win­dows of Olympic glory, but then leave them largely on their own dur­ing the years be­tween Games. And when their ca­reers are in­ter­rupted or over, the sys­tem moves on to the next star.</p>
    <p>“I feel like they don’t care about any­thing I do right now,” the 35-year-old said of the USOPC.</p>
    <p>In re­cent months, the com­mit­tee, which says it has al­ways wel­comed and wanted Phelps’ in­put, has formed a men­tal health task force to help change and ex­pand a sys­tem that its chief ex­ec­u­tive, Sarah Hir­sh­land, has made clear needs to be up­dated.</p>
    <p>The or­gan­i­sa­tion takes roughly 1,000 ath­letes com­bined to the Win­ter and Sum­mer Olympics dur­ing each four-year cy­cle but has just three men­tal health of­fi­cers.</p>
    <p>“There is room for us to grow and im­prove,” said USOPC chief of ath­lete ser­vices Bahati VanPelt.</p>
    <p>The crux of the prob­lem, Phelps and other ath­letes say, is that for sev­eral years, Olympic of­fi­cials and elite ath­letes have had very dif­fer­ent def­i­ni­tions of ath­lete sup­port.</p>
    <p>To the Olympic com­mit­tee, ath­lete sup­port has largely meant pro</p>
