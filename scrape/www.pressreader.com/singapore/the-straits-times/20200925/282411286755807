    <p>•</p>
    <p>Luis Suarez yes­ter­day broke down in tears in his farewell in­ter­view with Barcelona af­ter seal­ing a move to La Liga ri­vals Atletico Madrid.</p>
    <p>Barcelona said that Atletico had agreed to pay €6 mil­lion (S$9.6 mil­lion) for their third-high­est scorer of all-time be­hind Ce­sar Ro­driguez (232) and Lionel Messi (634).</p>
    <p>The Uruguayan net­ted 198 goals in 283 ap­pear­ances af­ter join­ing from Liver­pool in 2014, win­ning four l eague ti­tles, four Span­ish Cups and the Cham­pi­ons League.</p>
    <p>Suarez was told over the sum­mer that he was no longer re­quired by new coach Ron­ald Koe­man de­spite hit­ting 16 goals in 22 La Liga starts to fin­ish as the fourth top scorer in Spain’s top flight last term.</p>
    <p>He looked on his way to join Serie A cham­pi­ons Ju­ven­tus un­til new coach An­drea Pirlo said last week a deal was un­likely be­cause of de­lays in his bid to get an Ital­ian pass­port.</p>
    <p>Suarez’s exit comes as Koe­man at­tempts to re­shape Barca. He has shown the exit to Arturo Vi­dal and</p>
    <p>Ivan Rakitic, while Sa­muel Umtiti is also set to leave.</p>
    <p>How­ever, Suarez yes­ter­day ex­pressed his un­hap­pi­ness at be­ing un­cer­e­mo­ni­ously booted out, sug­gest­ing Messi was also un­happy at the man­ner of his de­par­ture.</p>
    <p>“The club needed changes and the coach didn’t count on me. I want to show that I can still per­form at a high level,” he said. “I’m join­ing Atletico with ex­cite­ment, but I still haven’t thought about what it’ll be like to play against Barca. I haven’t fully di­gested it yet.</p>
    <p>“Leo knows what I think and I know what he thinks. We are old enough to give each other ad­vice. Leo felt strange be­cause I’m go­ing to a di­rect ri­val, but noth­ing will change our re­la­tion­ship.”</p>
    <p>Suarez will be val­ued by Atletico man­ager Diego Sime­one, who once de­scribed him as a “hugely im­por­tant player”.</p>
    <p>The striker will replace Al­varo Mo­rata in Atletico’s front line af­ter the Spain striker was loaned to Juve for a sea­son with an op­tion to buy.</p>
    <p>Span­ish news­pa­per Mundo De­portivo re­ported that the deal was ex­pe­dited af­ter Suarez threat­ened to cir­cu­late a pri­vate e-mail from Barca that named the clubs – in­clud­ing Real Madrid, Manch­ester City and Paris Saint-Ger­main – he could not move to for free.</p>
