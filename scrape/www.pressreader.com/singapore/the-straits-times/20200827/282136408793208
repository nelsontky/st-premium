    <p>There are ex­cit­ing plans for the Ma­rina Bay float­ing plat­form (NS Square to be fo­cus of new Ma­rina Bay down­town, Aug 10).</p>
    <p>It will be a com­mu­nity space for large-scale events that will also pay trib­ute to Sin­ga­pore’s na­tional ser­vice­men.</p>
    <p>It was re­ported that NS Square will have a wa­ter sports cen­tre, a swim­ming pool and a na­tional ser­vice-themed gallery.</p>
    <p>It is due to be com­pleted by the end of 2025.</p>
    <p>There are re­ally good sug­ges­tions given by the pub­lic, but we must keep in mind that this venue is not just an­other Sin­ga­pore In­door Sta­dium, Sports Hub or recre­ational venue.</p>
    <p>It car­ries a far more sig­nif­i­cant and am­bi­tious vi­sion and re­spon­si­bil­ity – to bond fam­i­lies and na­tional ser­vice per­son­nel, and to re­mind Sin­ga­pore­ans that NS is crit­i­cal for Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>It is a re­minder that NS is a key part of the Sin­ga­porean iden­tity and an ex­is­ten­tial need for the coun­try.</p>
    <p>It also plays a part in pre­serv­ing racial and so­cial har­mony, and in strength­en­ing global and pub­lic con­fi­dence in the Sin­ga­pore Armed Forces (SAF) as a cred­i­ble fight­ing force.</p>
    <p>The pro­posed gallery to hon­our the con­tri­bu­tions of na­tional ser­vice­men past and present should re­flect the eight</p>
    <p>SAF core val­ues in a dis­cernible way. These are: loy­alty to coun­try, lead­er­ship, dis­ci­pline, pro­fes­sion­al­ism, fight­ing spirit, ethics, care for sol­diers and safety.</p>
    <p>It would be good to have mean­ing­ful and im­pact­ful per­ma­nent struc­tures or in­stal­la­tions at NS Square.</p>
    <p>Pol­i­cy­mak­ers could con­sider build­ing the largest dig­i­tal hand-print mu­ral which will al­low any visi­tor to scan his hands and, there­after, have the print dis­played per­ma­nently on a screen.</p>
    <p>Dis­play­ing the palm prints of vis­i­tors in that way will sig­nify unity and show that ev­ery­one is part of the NS fam­ily.</p>
    <p>NS Square could also show­case the dis­ci­pline and pro­fes­sion­al­ism of ser­vice­men by stag­ing for­mal mil­i­tary march-past cer­e­monies, just like the chang­ing of the guard that takes place at Taipei’s Chiang Kai-shek Me­mo­rial Hall ev­ery hour each day from 9am to 5pm.</p>
    <p>This would fos­ter a great sense of pride among the peo­ple to see the sol­diers all-im­pos­ing and smart in their uni­forms.</p>
    <p>The pro­posed gallery to hon­our the con­tri­bu­tions of na­tional ser­vice­men past and present should re­flect the eight SAF core val­ues in a dis­cernible way. These are: loy­alty to coun­try, lead­er­ship, dis­ci­pline, pro­fes­sion­al­ism, fight­ing spirit, ethics, care for sol­diers and safety.</p>
