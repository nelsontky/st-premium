    <p>SEOUL • South Korea started a spe­cial two-week coro­n­avirus preven­tion pe­riod yesterday as the coun­try’s daily in­fec­tions con­tin­ued to mount ahead of highly com­pet­i­tive an­nual college en­trance ex­am­i­na­tions.</p>
    <p>The Korea Dis­ease Con­trol and Preven­tion Agency re­ported 343 new cases by Wed­nes­day mid­night, bring­ing the to­tal in­fec­tions to 29,654, with 498 deaths.</p>
    <p>The daily tally has topped 200 for five con­sec­u­tive days and sur­passed 300 on Wed­nes­day for the first time since Au­gust af­ter a large out­break at a church po­lit­i­cal rally.</p>
    <p>Ris­ing Covid-19 case num­bers have fu­elled wor­ries among stu­dents and par­ents ahead of the an­nual college en­trance ex­ams, which play a huge role in stu­dents’ ed­u­ca­tion and ca­reer prospects.</p>
    <p>Al­most 500,000 high school se­niors will sit the ex­ams on Dec 3, the Ed­u­ca­tion Min­istry told Reuters.</p>
    <p>The min­istry called on all high schools na­tion­wide to re­turn to off­line classes a week be­fore the ex­ams and said it will tem­po­rar­ily dis­close names of any cram schools and study cafes that ex­pe­ri­ence an in­fec­tion during the pe­riod.</p>
    <p>The min­istry has se­cured at least 120 hospi­tal beds in 29 med­i­cal fa­cil­i­ties for stu­dents with Covid-19 ahead of exam day. For stu­dents in quar­an­tine, in­clud­ing those who had been in con­tact with Covid-19 pa­tients, the min­istry has se­cured at least 113 test cen­tres and 754 in­di­vid­ual test rooms, enough to ac­com­mo­date 3,800.</p>
    <p>The min­istry said it will not dis­close the ex­act num­ber of high school se­niors with Covid-19 to pre­vent fear among the test-tak­ers.</p>
    <p>Health Min­is­ter Park Ne­ung-hoo said South Korea stands at a crit­i­cal cross­roads of an­other mas­sive out­break.</p>
    <p>“We should pull to­gether in preven­tion mea­sures to help our kids fo­cus on the college en­trance ex­ams in a safe en­vi­ron­ment,” Mr Park told a meet­ing.</p>
    <p>From yesterday, pub­lic gath­er­ings of 100 peo­ple or more are banned, re­li­gious ser­vices and sport­ing events are lim­ited to 30 per cent of ca­pac­ity, while high­risk fa­cil­i­ties, in­clud­ing clubs and karaoke bars, must in­crease safe dis­tanc­ing among guests.</p>
