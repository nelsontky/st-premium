    <p>FRANK­FURT • Ger­many’s coro­n­avirus vac­ci­na­tion cam­paign faced de­lays in sev­eral cities after tem­per­a­ture track­ers showed about 1,000 of the shots made by BioNTech and Pfizer might not have been kept cold enough dur­ing tran­sit.</p>
    <p>“When read­ing the tem­per­a­ture log­gers that were en­closed in the cool boxes, doubts arose about the com­pli­ance with the cold chain re­quire­ments,” the district of Licht­en­fels in the north of Ger­many’s largest state Bavaria said in a state­ment.</p>
    <p>Med­i­cal staff found that the tem­per­a­ture in one vac­cine trans­port cool box had risen to 15 deg C, a spokesman for Licht­en­fels said, above the max­i­mum of 8 deg C stip­u­lated by the man­u­fac­tur­ers. He added that his district had not re­ceived ad­vice from BioNTech yet on how to pro­ceed.</p>
    <p>The re­gional gov­ern­ment of Bavaria’s Up­per Fran­co­nia re­gion, where sev­eral af­fected districts are based, said that BioNTech cleared the vac­cines late on Sun­day.</p>
    <p>“BioNTech has con­firmed the qual­ity of the vac­cine shots,” a spokesman for Up­per Fran­co­nia said. “The vac­ci­na­tion pro­gramme can start (in our re­gion).”</p>
    <p>BioNTech had ear­lier said in a state­ment that it was re­spon­si­ble for the ship­ment to the 25 Ger­man dis­tri­bu­tion cen­tres, and that the fed­eral states and lo­cal au­thor­i­ties were re­spon­si­ble for the ship­ment to the vac­ci­na­tion cen­tres and the mo­bile vac­ci­na­tion teams.</p>
    <p>“This is where the vari­a­tions in tem­per­a­ture oc­curred. We are in con­tact with many au­thor­i­ties to pro­vide ad­vice. How­ever, it is up to them how to pro­ceed,” a BioNTech spokesman said.</p>
    <p>In a pre­sen­ta­tion this month, BioNTech had said that once re­moved from the freezer, the vac­cine can be stored for up to five days at be­tween 2 deg C and 8 deg C and up to two hours at tem­per­a­tures up to 30 deg C, prior to use.</p>
    <p>The vac­cine, which uses new so­called mRNA tech­nol­ogy, must be stored at ul­tra-low tem­per­a­tures of about mi­nus 70 deg C be­fore be­ing shipped to dis­tri­bu­tion cen­tres in spe­cially de­signed cool boxes filled with dry ice.</p>
    <p>The Euro­pean Union launched a mass Covid-19 vac­ci­na­tion drive on Sun­day, with pen­sion­ers and medics lin­ing up to get the first shots.</p>
    <p>The de­lays in Ger­many high­light the chal­lenge in rolling out the vac­cine.</p>
    <p>Pfizer post­poned the de­liv­ery of its vac­cine to eight Euro­pean na­tions, in­clud­ing Spain, the Span­ish Health Min­istry said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The Span­ish branch of Pfizer in­formed Madrid on Sun­day night of the de­lay in ship­ments to the eight na­tions due to a “prob­lem in the load­ing and ship­ment process” at its plant in Bel­gium, the min­istry said in a state­ment. It did not spec­ify which Euro­pean na­tions, aside from Spain, were af­fected.</p>
    <p>Pfizer has in­formed the min­istry that the prob­lem “was al­ready re­solved” but the next de­liv­ery of vac­cines “will be a few hours late” and ar­rive in Spain to­day, a day later than ex­pected, the state­ment said.</p>
    <p>Asked about the de­lay at an in­ter­view with Ser ra­dio, Health Min­is­ter Sal­vador Illa said it was due to a prob­lem “linked to the con­trol of the tem­per­a­ture” of the ship­ments that was “ap­par­ently fixed”.</p>
