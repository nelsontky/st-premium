    <p>DBS Bank, which says a third of its cus­tomers had neg­a­tive cash flow from Jan­uary to June, is ramp­ing up its dig­i­tal fi­nan­cial plan­ning so­lu­tions and tools to help Sin­ga­pore­ans in re­tire­ment plan­ning and boost their fi­nan­cial re­silience.</p>
    <p>The bank stud­ied its pool of cus­tomers who have their salaries cred­ited to DBS/POSB ac­counts and found that for one-third of them, money flow­ing out of their ac­counts on av­er­age ex­ceeded the amount go­ing in dur­ing the first six months of this year.</p>
    <p>The so­lu­tions that the bank will launch this week in­clude a Map Your Money in­ter­ac­tive dash­board that can project a cus­tomer’s fu­ture re­tire­ment needs based on his cur­rent fi­nances. It is part of the bank’s dig­i­tal ad­vi­sory tool NAV Plan­ner, which in turn is within DBS/POSB’s mo­bile and In­ter­net bank­ing ser­vice.</p>
    <p>DBS will launch on Satur­day a re­tire­ment plan­ning por­tal to help cus­tomers with es­tate plan­ning is­sues. This will of­fer ac­cess to rel­e­vant ser­vices such as Cen­tral Prov­i­dent Fund (CPF) nom­i­na­tion, will writ­ing and set­ting up a Last­ing Power of At­tor­ney.</p>
    <p>The group also an­nounced a first-of-its-kind col­lab­o­ra­tion be­tween the CPF Board and a bank; they will work to­gether to train the bank’s wealth plan­ning man­agers and loan spe­cial­ists on CPF schemes.</p>
    <p>Not­ing that CPF is an im­por­tant foun­da­tion of re­tire­ment for many Sin­ga­pore­ans, the board’s group di­rec­tor of com­mu­ni­ca­tions Irene Kang said it wel­comed sim­i­lar col­lab­o­ra­tions with other fi­nan­cial in­sti­tu­tions.</p>
    <p>DBS said its new so­lu­tions will help cus­tomers and their wealth plan­ning man­agers to iden­tify and ad­dress blind spots in their re­tire­ment plan­ning, whether a cus­tomer is ac­cu­mu­lat­ing as­sets or mov­ing into the de­cu­mu­la­tion phase – when cus­tomers be­gin to con­vert their sav­ings, in­vest­ments and other re­tire­ment ben­e­fits into sus­tain­able in­come that can fund their re­quire­ments af­ter the pay cheques stop.</p>
    <p>“While most DBS cus­tomers know when they want to re­tire, they are less cer­tain about how long their nest egg will last. They also do not know how to sup­ple­ment their cash and CPF sav­ings with in­vest­ments,” the bank said.</p>
    <p>The Map Your Money func­tion pulls to­gether cus­tomers’ as­sets within and out­side DBS, and projects their fu­ture i ncome based on pre-de­fined as­sump­tions, so that they can bet­ter vi­su­alise their fu­ture cash flow sit­u­a­tion. It also in­te­grates base­line CPF and Sup­ple­men­tary Re­tire­ment Scheme rules to pro­vide a has­sle-free ex­pe­ri­ence for cus­tomers when as­sess­ing their fi­nan­cial fu­ture, DBS added.</p>
    <p>DBS head of consumer bank­ing Jeremy Soo said: “Dur­ing th­ese un­cer­tain times when peo­ple are wor­ried about de­clin­ing in­comes and out­liv­ing their sav­ings, DBS has an even greater re­spon­si­bil­ity to ex­tend our ex­per­tise in man­ag­ing money and sim­pli­fy­ing re­tire­ment plan­ning for Sin­ga­pore­ans.”</p>
