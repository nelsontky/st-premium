    <p>Re­cently, my son, a stu­dent at an English univer­sity, told me of the overt racism and xeno­pho­bia that he was fac­ing there.</p>
    <p>They ranged from “bat soup” re­marks to xeno­pho­bic at­tacks such as be­ing told to go back to China. When my son ex­plained that he did not eat bat soup and that he was a Chi­nese Malaysian liv­ing in Sin­ga­pore, such re­marks and at­tacks only grew worse.</p>
    <p>When I was study­ing and work­ing in Bri­tain dur­ing the 1980s, I did en­counter racism and some xeno­pho­bia. How­ever, they were of the covert type and man­age­able. Over­all, I en­joyed my time in Bri­tain, be­com­ing some­thing of an An­glophile.</p>
    <p>My son and his for­eign stu­dent friends put the present overt racism and xeno­pho­bia down to</p>
    <p>Brexit and Covid-19. These have fu­elled racism and xeno­pho­bia, es­pe­cially against those of Chi­nese an­ces­try.</p>
    <p>Any­body of Chi­nese an­ces­try is as­sumed to be from China, and a car­rier or pro­gen­i­tor of the “China virus”. That is about as log­i­cal as as­sum­ing that all white peo­ple are from Eng­land, or that any­body of English an­ces­try is a car­rier or pro­gen­i­tor of the coro­n­avirus vari­ant.</p>
    <p>Iron­i­cally, post-Brexit, when Bri­tain is turn­ing to the Com­mon­wealth for in­creased trade and po­lit­i­cal ties, such racism and xeno­pho­bia risk alien­at­ing for­eign stu­dents who may well be the fu­ture lead­ers and pro­fes­sion­als of the Com­mon­wealth.</p>
