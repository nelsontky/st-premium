    <p>The scenes of thou­sands of vi­o­lent sup­port­ers of United States Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump storm­ing and van­dal­is­ing the US Capi­tol – the equiv­a­lent of Par­lia­ment here – and dis­rupt­ing the for­mal cer­ti­fi­ca­tion of Mr Joe Bi­den as the coun­try’s next pres­i­dent were be­yond shock­ing. The episode was rem­i­nis­cent of what typ­i­cally hap­pens in some Third World coun­tries where democ­racy has shal­low roots and mob power is able to sway out­comes. It was unimag­in­able that it would even be at­tempted in the US, which prides it­self on be­ing the beacon of democ­racy. That has been dealt a dam­ag­ing blow.</p>
    <p>In hind­sight, the in­ci­dent – aptly de­scribed as an in­sur­rec­tion rather than a protest – should not have come as a huge sur­prise. Ever since los­ing the pres­i­den­tial elec­tion last Novem­ber, Mr Trump him­self and some of his po­lit­i­cal al­lies and en­ablers have been in­cit­ing pro-Trump el­e­ments to re­ject the re­sults, and more re­cently, to march on the Capi­tol to protest against their cer­ti­fi­ca­tion by Congress – all of which was am­pli­fied by con­spir­acy the­o­rists. Some an­a­lysts had warned of sim­i­lar sce­nar­ios.</p>
    <p>This un­prece­dented se­quence of events in the US is a sober­ing re­minder of the fact that what po­lit­i­cal lead­ers utter – whether true or false, sooth­ing or threat­en­ing – can, es­pe­cially in the age of so­cial me­dia, have enor­mous reper­cus­sions, for good or for ill. In this case, it was for the lat­ter.</p>
    <p>The as­sault on the Capi­tol also high­lights the fact that it takes only a small group of po­lit­i­cal ex­trem­ists to un­leash chaos. The in­sur­rec­tion­ists do not rep­re­sent the broad base of Trump sup­port­ers or other Repub­li­cans. They were largely mem­bers of far-right fringe groups that have flour­ished dur­ing the Trump pres­i­dency.</p>
    <p>Re­as­sur­ingly, Amer­ica’s in­sti­tu­tions – its courts, state elec­toral bod­ies and most of its leg­is­la­tors – have re­pu­di­ated the re­peated at­tempts to over­turn the elec­tion re­sults. The in­va­sion of the Capi­tol, which has re­volted the vast ma­jor­ity of Amer­i­cans and shocked the world, is also likely to take the wind out of any re­main­ing ef­forts to in­val­i­date Pres­i­dent-elect Bi­den’s le­git­i­mate vic­tory. But Mr Bi­den will in­herit the legacy of a po­lit­i­cally po­larised na­tion in the midst of a rag­ing coron­avirus pan­demic as well as a re­ces­sion.</p>
    <p>One of his first tasks must be to try to heal the di­vi­sions that have deep­ened dur­ing the Trump pres­i­dency. Mr Bi­den will be bol­stered by yes­ter­day’s vic­to­ries by Democrats in the two cru­cial Se­nate races in the state of Ge­or­gia, which will ef­fec­tively hand his party con­trol of the US Se­nate. This will give his ad­min­is­tra­tion a freer hand to shape the so­cial, eco­nomic and po­lit­i­cal agenda dur­ing his term. He will now also have to use this power to truly be a pres­i­dent for all Amer­i­cans, a pledge that Mr Trump had also made four years ago, but on which he did not de­liver.</p>
