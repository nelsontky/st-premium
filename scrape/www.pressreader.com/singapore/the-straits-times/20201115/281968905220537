    <p>Pres­i­dent Halimah Yacob held her first Face­book Live ses­sion with the pub­lic yes­ter­day as part of the Is­tana’s Deep­avali vir­tual open house.</p>
    <p>Madam Halimah an­swered ques­tions about her favourite place in the Is­tana (the gar­dens) and whether she lives in the sprawl­ing es­tate (she does not).</p>
    <p>A ques­tion on what has changed about the res­i­dence since she be­came Pres­i­dent prompted Madam Halimah to note that she took steps to make the Is­tana more ac­ces­si­ble after hear­ing from many Sin­ga­pore­ans – es­pe­cially the less priv­i­leged – that they have not had the chance to visit it.</p>
    <p>Ini­tia­tives she has in­tro­duced in­clude pro­grammes that let peo­ple vol­un­teer as gar­den­ers on the grounds, and grant­ing ac­cess to groups such as hospice pa­tients and se­nior cit­i­zens.</p>
    <p>She added that the Pres­i­dent’s Chal­lenge has also evolved.</p>
    <p>She said: “We fo­cus a great deal on em­pow­er­ing peo­ple with dis­abil­i­ties and dis­ad­van­taged fam­i­lies – that’s very im­por­tant for us, em­pow­er­ing peo­ple.”</p>
    <p>She also com­mented on next year’s chal­lenge theme, Build­ing A</p>
    <p>Dig­i­tally In­clu­sive So­ci­ety, not­ing that “we re­alised with Covid-19 (that) you need to lever­age a lot on tech­nol­ogy”.</p>
    <p>“What we’re con­cerned about is that peo­ple who are dis­ad­van­taged may not be able to do so be­cause of a lack of re­sources, lack of skills or abil­ity,” she said. “But we want them to re­main eco­nom­i­cally and so­cially con­nected.”</p>
    <p>The Is­tana is open to the pub­lic on Chi­nese New Year, Labour Day, Na­tional Day, Hari Raya Puasa and Deep­avali.</p>
    <p>The Deep­avali event this year had to take place vir­tu­ally ow­ing to the pandemic, just as it had for Hari Raya and Na­tional Day.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day’s vir­tual au­di­ence came up to more than 12,000. Some were taken on a tour through the Is­tana by vol­un­teer guide Tan Hui Kheng. This was the first time 61-year-old Ms Tan – who has been giv­ing such tours since they were launched in 2013 – had to give a vir­tual tour. She said: “It’s a new ex­pe­ri­ence talk­ing to the cam­era in­stead of to vis­i­tors.”</p>
    <p>She said she was ini­tially un­com­fort­able with the pres­ence of a cam­era, but added that it al­lowed view­ers a close-up view of spa­ces and items that on-site vis­i­tors can see only from a dis­tance.</p>
    <p>“It’s a fun ex­pe­ri­ence too, as I learnt an­other de­liv­ery mode of</p>
    <p>STRESS FROM COVID-19 bring­ing the tour di­rectly to par­tic­i­pants,” Ms Tan said.</p>
    <p>The tour was in­ter­spersed with plenty of colour­ful seg­ments, in­clud­ing a vir­tual pre­sen­ta­tion by Wildlife Re­serves Sin­ga­pore on the var­i­ous an­i­mals in its zoo and sa­faris, while Ad­mi­ralty Pri­mary School pupils staged an In­dian dance and com­mu­nity group Team Fu­sion put up a mu­si­cal per­for­mance.</p>
    <p>Au­di­ence mem­bers also had the chance to win Is­tana mer­chan­dise by an­swer­ing ques­tions about home in a vir­tual quiz.</p>
    <p>“I’m re­ally glad that de­spite Covid-19 we’re still able, by lever­ag­ing on tech­nol­ogy, to grant ac­cess to Sin­ga­pore­ans to the Is­tana,” said</p>
    <p>Madam Halimah.</p>
    <p>She also thanked Sin­ga­pore­ans for sup­port­ing the Gov­ern­ment in its ef­forts to curb Covid-19, not­ing that her own fam­ily had to split into three groups to visit her dur­ing Hari Raya.</p>
    <p>“I un­der­stand the stress is tremen­dous on peo­ple, but peo­ple have done re­ally well... So long as we con­tinue to do our part, I hope we can over­come this pe­riod to­gether, and hope­fully we will see an even bet­ter sit­u­a­tion next year.</p>
    <p>“Let’s con­tinue to sup­port each other.”</p>
    <p>She closed the ses­sion by wish­ing ev­ery­one a happy Deep­avali.</p>
    <p>I un­der­stand the stress is tremen­dous on peo­ple, but peo­ple have done re­ally well... So long as we con­tinue to do our part, I hope we can over­come this pe­riod to­gether, and hope­fully we will see an even bet­ter sit­u­a­tion next year. Let’s con­tinue to sup­port each other.</p>
