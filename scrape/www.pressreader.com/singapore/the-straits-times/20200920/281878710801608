    <p>The death of a war­rior of the law – the seem­ingly in­domitable United States Supreme Court Jus­tice Ruth Bader Gins­burg – on Fri­day at 87, af­ter a long bat­tle with cancer, has brought the core agenda of Amer­i­can con­ser­va­tives within tan­ta­lis­ing reach, rais­ing the stakes in the up­com­ing elec­tion.</p>
    <p>The sud­den va­cancy she left is set to shift the bal­ance of the nine-seat bench of the Supreme Court to the con­ser­va­tives for decades to come.</p>
    <p>US Supreme Court jus­tices are ap­pointed for life or un­til they re­tire.</p>
    <p>Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump has an op­por­tu­nity now, with a Repub­li­can-ma­jor­ity Se­nate, to ram through an ap­point­ment while still in of­fice, or risk los­ing power and leav­ing the ap­point­ment to the Democrats.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, in a Tweet ad­dressed to the Repub­li­can Party, he said: “We were put in this po­si­tion of power and im­por­tance to make de­ci­sions for the peo­ple who so proudly elected us, the most im­por­tant of which has long been con­sid­ered to be the se­lec­tion of United States Supreme Court jus­tices. We have this obli­ga­tion, with­out de­lay!”</p>
    <p>Ap­point­ing a new jus­tice now opens the door to re­vers­ing gains of lib­er­als and pro­gres­sives, in terms of women’s rights, LGBTQ (les­bian, gay, bi­sex­ual, trans­gen­der and queer) rights, gun con­trol, and even as far back as the land­mark 1973 Roe v Wade judg­ment which de­crim­i­nalised abor­tion – which has been in the sights of con­ser­va­tives ever since.</p>
    <p>A 2016 Pew Re­search Cen­tre poll found that 65 per cent of vot­ers cited ap­point­ments to the Supreme Court as an im­por­tant fac­tor in their vot­ing de­ci­sion. Now the strug­gle over fill­ing Jus­tice Gins­burg’s po­si­tion adds yet an­other di­men­sion to the bit­ter­ness of Amer­ica’s po­lit­i­cal di­vide, less than 50 days to the Nov 3 elec­tion.</p>
    <p>Re­port­edly just days be­fore her death, Jus­tice Gins­burg dic­tated a state­ment to her grand­daugh­ter Clara Spera, say­ing: “My most fer­vent wish is that I will not be re­placed un­til a new pres­i­dent is in­stalled.”</p>
    <p>But even as hun­dreds gath­ered spon­ta­neously at the Supreme Court late on Fri­day night in Wash­ing­ton, Se­nate Ma­jor­ity Leader Mitch McCon­nell was sig­nalling a rush to re­place Jus­tice Gins­burg, as­sert­ing: “Pres­i­dent Trump’s nom­i­nee will re­ceive a vote on the floor of the United States Se­nate.”</p>
    <p>It was in stark con­trast to his own state­ment in Fe­bru­ary 2016 when, also faced with a va­cant seat on the Supreme Court bench fol­low­ing the death of Jus­tice An­tonin Scalia, a lead­ing con­ser­va­tive voice, Mr McCon­nell had said then: “The Amer­i­can peo­ple should have a voice in the se­lec­tion of their next Supreme Court jus­tice. There­fore, this va­cancy should not be filled un­til we have a new pres­i­dent.”</p>
    <p>Repub­li­cans suc­cess­fully stalled the fill­ing of the po­si­tion, which deeply ran­kled Democrats. Then Pres­i­dent Barack Obama’s Supreme Court nom­i­nee, Mr Mer­rick Gar­land, did not even get a hear­ing from the Repub­li­can-con­trolled Se­nate. In the end, Pres­i­dent</p>
    <p>Trump made two ap­point­ments – both of them con­ser­va­tives – to the Supreme Court. The first was Jus­tice Neil Gor­such in early 2017; the sec­ond, Jus­tice Brett Ka­vanaugh in 2018 – who re­placed re­tired Jus­tice An­thony Kennedy.</p>
    <p>The Supreme Court bench is, thus, al­ready some­what ide­o­log­i­cally con­ser­va­tive; an­other con­ser­va­tive ap­point­ment will de­ci­sively tilt it. Mak­ing a third ap­point­ment would be an en­dur­ing le­gacy for Pres­i­dent Trump.</p>
    <p>The gap be­tween the two par­ties over the Supreme Court has mean­while widened.</p>
    <p>In Au­gust last year, Pew Re­search found that three quar­ters of Repub­li­cans and Repub­li­can-lean­ing in­de­pen­dents had a favourable opin­ion of the Supreme Court, com­pared with only about half (49 per cent) of Democrats and Demo­cratic lean­ers.</p>
    <p>While it would be un­usu­ally fast to com­plete the en­tire con­fir­ma­tion process in less than 50 days, it is pos­si­ble.</p>
    <p>An ad­di­tional spec­tre looms – of a Supreme Court tasked to rule on a dis­puted elec­tion re­sult.</p>
    <p>In that re­gard, the com­po­si­tion of the bench is even more crit­i­cal in the short term, for Pres­i­dent</p>
    <p>Trump who has ex­plic­itly ques­tioned the in­tegrity and cred­i­bil­ity of the elec­toral process – seem­ingly to pre­pare the ground to dis­pute the re­sult should he lose.</p>
    <p>“Gins­burg’s death cre­ates new dy­nam­ics if there is an elec­tion-re­lated dis­pute be­fore the court,” said FiveThir­tyEight, a po­lit­i­cal anal­y­sis web­site, in a com­men­tary. “One of the most di­vi­sive elec­tions in Amer­i­can his­tory will now likely be even more tense and fraught,” it added.</p>
    <p>She was a mag­nif­i­cent judge and a won­der­ful per­son – a bril­liant lawyer with a car­ing heart, com­mon sense, fierce de­vo­tion to fair­ness and equal­ity, and bound­less courage in the face of her own ad­ver­sity.</p>
