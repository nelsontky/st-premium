    <p>Ear­lier this month, the United Na­tions De­vel­op­ment Pro­gramme (UNDP) re­leased its lat­est Hu­man De­vel­op­ment Re­port and in­dex, which it has done ev­ery year for the last 30 years.</p>
    <p>The UNDP’s Hu­man De­vel­op­ment In­dex (HDI), which ranks coun­tries on the ba­sis of health, education and liv­ing stan­dards, is a su­pe­rior mea­sure­ment of hu­man well-be­ing to gross do­mes­tic prod­uct per capita. But this year, the UNDP added another met­ric. It in­cor­po­rated “plan­e­tary pres­sures” to cre­ate a new in­dex. This in­dex, called the “plan­e­tary pres­sures-ad­justed HDI” (PHDI), ad­justs the stan­dard HDI by a coun­try’s level of car­bon emis­sions and ma­te­rial footprint, on a per capita ba­sis. The higher a coun­try’s car­bon and ma­te­rial footprint per head, the lower its PHDI score.</p>
    <p>This has had a dra­matic im­pact on rank­ings. Oil-rich Nor­way, which leads the HDI rank­ings, falls 15 places un­der the PHDI. Other oil- and gas-rich coun­tries drop even more sharply. The United States, for in­stance, drops 45 spots.</p>
    <p>The PHDI also sends a sig­nal to high per capita emitters of car­bon that they need to change their ways. Sin­ga­pore’s rank­ing falls by a whop­ping 92 places com­pared with its nor­mal HDI rank (11th), while Lux­em­bourg falls 131 places – the big­gest drop of all.</p>
    <p>The UNDP claims that the PHDI presents “a new global pic­ture”, which yields “a less rosy but clearer assessment of hu­man progress”.</p>
    <p>Its head Achim Steiner puts it this way: “To sur­vive and thrive in this new age, we must re­design a path to progress that re­spects the in­ter­twined fate of peo­ple and planet and recog­nises that the car­bon and ma­te­rial footprint of the peo­ple who have more is chok­ing the op­por­tu­ni­ties of the peo­ple who have less.”</p>
    <p>THE FLAWED NOR­MAL</p>
    <p>The mes­sage is clear: As Covid-19 starts to wind down with the arrival of vac­cines, economies must move not only from relief to re­cov­ery, but also to rein­ven­tion.</p>
    <p>Some peo­ple yearn for a re­turn to “nor­mal”. But nor­mal, as we know it, is de­for­esta­tion, heat­waves, wild­fires, hur­ri­canes, land­slides and floods – and pan­demics. To re­turn to that world would be, as the Hu­man De­vel­op­ment Re­port points out, “to con­sign the fu­ture to end­less cri­sis man­age­ment, not to hu­man de­vel­op­ment”. There will be more en­vi­ron­men­tal dev­as­ta­tion and more pan­demics. Covid-19 “is just the tip of the spear”.</p>
    <p>But nor­mal is also flawed for rea­sons other than en­vi­ron­men­tal dev­as­ta­tion. Nor­mal is se­vere eco­nomic in­equal­ity and dig­i­tal di­vides within and be­tween coun­tries. Nor­mal is com­pa­nies think­ing short term and putting share­holder in­ter­ests above all else. Nor­mal is an ero­sion of global co­op­er­a­tion. This is not the world we want to re­turn to.</p>
    <p>That is why some peo­ple point out that se­man­tics mat­ter when we talk about the fu­ture. For in­stance, Ox­ford Univer­sity’s pro­fes­sor of glob­al­i­sa­tion and de­vel­op­ment Ian Goldin does not like the com­monly used terms “bounce back” or “re­set” – we should not bounce back to where we were, he says. Nor should we re­set to the op­er­at­ing sys­tem we had be­fore. What we need is some­thing to­tally dif­fer­ent.</p>
    <p>So what needs to change? One is pri­or­i­ties.</p>
    <p>Prof Goldin gives a stark ex­am­ple. When it comes to threats, for most coun­tries, pan­demics are way big­ger than mil­i­tary threats. Yet, coun­tries al­lo­cate thou­sands of times more re­sources to their mil­i­taries than to pan­demic pre­ven­tion and con­trol. Hun­dreds of bil­lions of dol­lars are spent on weapons, but the budget of the World Health Or­gan­i­sa­tion (WHO) is less than the cost of a sin­gle war­ship.</p>
    <p>As­so­ci­ate pro­fes­sor in eco­nom­ics Ul­rich Volz from London Univer­sity’s School of Ori­en­tal and African Stud­ies points out that pub­lic fi­nances do not pri­ori­tise sus­tain­abil­ity. The bud­get­ing process of gov­ern­ments does not usu­ally in­cor­po­rate cli­mate risks or sus­tain­abil­ity risks.</p>
    <p>Typ­i­cally, gov­ern­ments have fis­cal tar­gets in their bud­gets, but not cli­mate tar­gets. Cli­mate risks are not prop­erly priced, which dis­cour­ages the shift from dirty in­dus­tries to clean ones. In fact, many gov­ern­ments con­tinue to sub­sidise fos­sil fu­els.</p>
    <p>Fi­nan­cial risk as­sess­ments also fre­quently ig­nore cli­mate-re­lated risks. The typ­i­cal met­rics used are var­i­ous debt ra­tios, earn­ings ra­tios and re­turns on cap­i­tal, which has not changed in decades. There is not enough em­pha­sis on ex­po­sure to cli­mate-re­lated risks, which ap­ply not only to com­pa­nies, but also to banks and in­sur­ers. The Mone­tary Author­ity of Sin­ga­pore is one of the few cen­tral banks that are in­cor­po­rat­ing sus­tain­abil­ity met­rics in their assessment of sys­temic risks.</p>
    <p>Many of these con­cerns have been aired for sev­eral years. But there is now no ex­cuse to ig­nore them, with cli­mate risks star­ing us in the face, and with clean al­ter­na­tives to dirty en­er­gies having be­come at least as price com­pet­i­tive, if not cheaper. The idea that cli­mate con­cerns are in­com­pat­i­ble with good busi­ness prac­tices or eco­nomic growth is not only ob­so­lete, but also dan­ger­ous.</p>
    <p>RE­SHAP­ING THE ROLE OF GOVT</p>
    <p>One of the keys to rein­vent­ing the fu­ture lies in re­shap­ing the role of gov­ern­ment.</p>
    <p>Among the lega­cies of Covid-19 has been a height­ened de­pen­dence on gov­ern­ments around the world. Only gov­ern­ments could have pro­vided large-scale liq­uid­ity and fis­cal as­sis­tance to stem job losses and keep com­pa­nies afloat, passed emer­gency leg­is­la­tion and im­posed reg­u­la­tions to pre­vent the trans­mis­sion of in­fec­tions. Only gov­ern­ments can mo­bilise pub­lic health sys­tems to cope with the pan­demic and or­ches­trate the dis­tri­bu­tion of vac­cines.</p>
    <p>In the spirit of not wast­ing a good cri­sis, some econ­o­mists pro­pose that gov­ern­ments should use their en­hanced lever­age to not just re­vive growth, but also steer economies in new direc­tions.</p>
    <p>For in­stance, Univer­sity Col­lege London’s pro­fes­sor of eco­nom­ics Mar­i­ana Maz­zu­cato sug­gests that gov­ern­ments should im­pose con­di­tions when they ex­tend as­sis­tance to the cor­po­rate sec­tor. For in­stance, de­pend­ing on what pri­or­i­ties coun­tries choose to pur­sue, bailouts could be con­di­tioned on com­pa­nies re­duc­ing car­bon emis­sions, not hid­ing prof­its in tax havens, ac­cel­er­at­ing dig­i­tal­i­sa­tion, lim­it­ing CEO bonuses, curb­ing div­i­dends and share buy­backs, and im­prov­ing work con­di­tions. “With­out con­di­tions, gov­ern­ment as­sis­tance runs the risk of sub­si­dis­ing bad busi­ness prac­tices,” Prof Maz­zu­cato points out.</p>
    <p>Some gov­ern­ments have at­tached con­di­tions to their as­sis­tance. For ex­am­ple, 37 per cent of the Euro­pean Union’s</p>
    <p>€750 bil­lion (S$1.2 tril­lion) pack­age, an­nounced in June, is ear­marked for fund­ing green ini­tia­tives, and EU loans and grants come with green strings at­tached.</p>
    <p>Gov­ern­ment loan guar­an­tees should also be ac­com­pa­nied by pro­vi­sions for eq­uity con­ver­sion, ac­cord­ing to Prof Maz­zu­cato. If tax­payer funds are risked to res­cue a com­pany in trou­ble, tax­pay­ers should also share in the up­side if that com­pany goes on to pros­per.</p>
    <p>In short, the gov­ern­ments should not just fix prob­lems and then with­draw. They should also act as part­ners in re­shap­ing economies to achieve social goals. While gov­ern­ments have done a lot to com­bat Covid-19, one area where they have fallen short is global co­op­er­a­tion, a fact that even United Na­tions Sec­re­tary-Gen­eral An­to­nio Guter­res high­lighted when he warned against “go-it-alone poli­cies” in June.</p>
    <p>Amid a global pan­demic, ini­tial re­sponses were na­tion­al­is­tic. Up to April, more than 70 coun­tries banned or limited ex­ports of pro­tec­tive med­i­cal equip­ment. Some im­posed travel bans with­out co­or­di­nat­ing with, or even con­sult­ing, the coun­tries af­fected. In March, the UN Se­cu­rity Coun­cil failed to is­sue any res­o­lu­tion on the pan­demic that could have paved the way for in­ter­na­tional ac­tion. The Group of 20 re­fused the In­ter­na­tional Mone­tary Fund’s re­quest to dou­ble its re­sources so that it could ex­tend more as­sis­tance to poor coun­tries.</p>
    <p>Rather than col­lab­o­rat­ing with one another, the gov­ern­ments of the world’s two largest economies, the US and China, en­gaged in fin­ger-point­ing (although their med­i­cal re­searchers, along with oth­ers around the world, did col­lab­o­rate). The US pulled out of the WHO in the mid­dle of the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>SCOURGE OF ‘VACCINATIO­NALISM’</p>
    <p>Even be­fore vac­cines were rolled out, “vac­cine na­tion­al­ism” be­came ram­pant. Data from the Duke Univer­sity’s Global Health In­no­va­tion Cen­tre, which is track­ing vac­cine con­tracts, shows that the bulk of pro­duc­tion so far – about 10 bil­lion doses – has been re­served, mainly by rich coun­tries.</p>
    <p>Some, such as the US, the EU, the United King­dom and Canada, have booked vac­cines to in­oc­u­late their pop­u­la­tions many times over. Given the con­straints on vac­cine man­u­fac­tur­ing ca­pac­ity, this means that most poor coun­tries will have to wait till at least 2023 be­fore the ma­jor­ity of their pop­u­la­tions have ac­cess to vac­cines. Healthy peo­ple in rich coun­tries will get vac­ci­nated be­fore vul­ner­a­ble peo­ple in poor coun­tries. The global dis­tri­bu­tion of vac­cines is be­ing de­ter­mined by abil­ity to pay rather than need.</p>
    <p>While there is a WHO-sup­ported in­ter­na­tional al­liance of more than 180 coun­tries – called Covax – to help all coun­tries get vac­cines, many of its rich coun­try mem­bers have struck side deals with man­u­fac­tur­ers to en­sure they get vac­cines first, which un­der­mines the goal of equal ac­cess. Covax is also se­verely un­der­funded.</p>
    <p>While the de­sire of gov­ern­ments to give pri­or­ity to their own cit­i­zens is po­lit­i­cally un­der­stand­able, health ex­perts point out that it is the wrong way to go from a moral, eth­i­cal, sci­en­tific or eco­nomic point of view.</p>
    <p>WHO di­rec­tor-gen­eral Te­dros Ad­hanom Ghe­breye­sus has warned that vac­cine na­tion­al­ism will only pro­long the pan­demic, as in­fec­tions will con­tinue to rise in poor coun­tries and will in­evitably spread to those wait­ing to be vac­ci­nated in rich coun­tries.</p>
    <p>Trade and tourism will be af­fected, caus­ing eco­nomic losses, which the Rand Cor­po­ra­tion es­ti­mates would amount to</p>
    <p>US$1.2 tril­lion (S$1.6 tril­lion) a year. Poverty and in­equal­ity around the world will also in­crease, lead­ing to other prob­lems.</p>
    <p>The lack of global co­op­er­a­tion is another “nor­mal” that the world can do with­out.</p>
    <p>It is not too late to change. Global in­sti­tu­tions that can lead mul­ti­lat­eral ef­forts on health, cli­mate change and fi­nan­cial as­sis­tance al­ready ex­ist. A new ad­min­is­tra­tion in the US could make a dif­fer­ence, by re­join­ing the Paris agree­ment on cli­mate change and the WHO, en­list­ing the US in Covax (of which it is not a mem­ber), re­plen­ish­ing the cof­fers of in­ter­na­tional fi­nan­cial in­sti­tu­tions, and push­ing for global so­lu­tions to global prob­lems.</p>
    <p>Although nor­mal is bro­ken, it can be fixed.</p>
    <p>Re­vert­ing to the way we were is not a vi­able op­tion. Economies must move not only from relief to re­cov­ery, but also to rein­ven­tion.</p>
