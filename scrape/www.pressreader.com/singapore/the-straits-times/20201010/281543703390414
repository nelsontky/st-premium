    <p>Re­search shows that most peo­ple with men­tal ill­nesses do not seek any kind of pro­fes­sional help.</p>
    <p>The Ulysses con­tract – an advance di­rec­tive – may be one way of help­ing in­di­vid­u­als who need treat­ment but be­lieve they do not, says Pro­fes­sor Chong Siow Ann.</p>
    <p>It hap­pens just about ev­ery time. Af­ter I give a pub­lic talk on some men­tal health topic, one or two peo­ple from the au­di­ence hang back and ap­proach me.</p>
    <p>They seek ad­vice on how to deal with some­one close to them – a child, a sib­ling, an erst­while friend – who is of­ten se­questered at home and ob­vi­ously un­well men­tally, but re­fuses to ei­ther seek help or re­sume treat­ment.</p>
    <p>I trot out the usual ad­vice – when the per­son adamantly re­sists any sug­ges­tion of pro­fes­sional help, try to work around any rigid or odd be­liefs and do not ar­gue. Lis­ten pa­tiently, keep calm and em­pathise, I urge.</p>
    <p>Con­fronta­tion and co­er­cion, I tell them, are usu­ally ill ad­vised un­less the per­son be­haves in a dan­ger­ous man­ner, in which case, the po­lice have to be called.</p>
    <p>Gen­tler per­sua­sion and sub­tler forms of pres­sure may be more ef­fec­tive, but the truth is that the per­son’s fam­ily and friends have prob­a­bly tried al­most ev­ery­thing, and there is usu­ally noth­ing new I can of­fer.</p>
    <p>Re­search shows that most peo­ple with men­tal ill­nesses do not seek any kind of pro­fes­sional help.</p>
    <p>From the Sin­ga­pore Men­tal Health Study that my col­leagues and I un­der­took in 2016, we found that seven out of 10 peo­ple with ma­jor de­pres­sive dis­or­ders, and eight out of 10 with bipo­lar dis­or­der, ob­ses­sive com­pul­sive dis­or­der and al­co­hol abuse, did not seek help in the past year.</p>
    <p>Other than the per­sonal dis­tress they face, peo­ple with un­treated men­tal ill­ness are more likely to have run-ins with the law, be job­less, have more prob­lems with re­la­tion­ships and be more ne­glect­ful of their phys­i­cal health. They are also more likely to die pre­ma­turely.</p>
    <p>The rea­sons for re­fus­ing to seek help are myr­iad. Some would rather deal with the prob­lem on their own; also, there may be a per­va­sive fear of stig­ma­ti­sa­tion and dis­crim­i­na­tion.</p>
    <p>Or the per­son may have lit­tle knowl­edge of men­tal ill­ness or have a per­ceived difficulty in ac­cess­ing pro­fes­sional help, for rea­sons that may in­clude cost.</p>
    <p>Or it could be due to a to­tal un­aware­ness of his ill­ness – this lack of in­sight is par­tic­u­larly com­mon in se­ri­ous men­tal ill­nesses like bipo­lar dis­or­der and schizophre­nia.</p>
    <p>Pos­sess­ing in­sight into one’s ill­ness is cor­re­lated with fewer hos­pi­tal read­mis­sions, bet­ter per­for­mance at work and more so­cial con­tacts, but it is also linked with lower self-es­teem and de­pres­sion. So, one the­ory is that de­nial is a way of pro­tect­ing one­self from a truth too painful and shat­ter­ing to bear. The more com­mon view, how­ever, is that it is not any un­con­scious de­fence mech­a­nism but more a cog­ni­tive deficit in­trin­sic to the dis­ease.</p>
    <p>THE IS­SUE OF DE­NIAL</p>
    <p>Pos­sess­ing in­sight into one’s ill­ness is cor­re­lated with fewer hos­pi­tal read­mis­sions, bet­ter per­for­mance at work and more so­cial con­tacts, but it is also linked with lower self-es­teem and de­pres­sion.</p>
    <p>So, one the­ory is that de­nial is a way of pro­tect­ing one­self from a truth too painful and shat­ter­ing to bear.</p>
    <p>The more com­mon view, how­ever, is that it is not any un­con­scious de­fence mech­a­nism but more a cog­ni­tive deficit in­trin­sic to the dis­ease.</p>
    <p>“It has noth­ing to do with wil­ful­ness – you just don’t have the ca­pac­ity to know,” says psy­chol­ogy pro­fes­sor Xavier Amador, who de­vised a tool, to which he gave the breezy acro­nym of Leap (lis­ten-em­pathise-agree-part­ner), to ne­go­ti­ate with a per­son with lit­tle or no in­sight of his ill­ness.</p>
    <p>The cor­ner­stone of Leap is “re­flec­tive lis­ten­ing”, which makes the per­son feel that his fears, an­guish, dis­tress and de­sires are taken se­ri­ously (even if these are un­rea­son­able due to the un­der­ly­ing ill­ness).</p>
    <p>This would make the per­son – as Pro­fes­sor Amador says – more likely to en­gage and con­sider some­thing that would oth­er­wise be unpalatabl­e.</p>
    <p>Prof Amador also as­serts that com­mon ground can be found, even be­tween the most ex­tremely op­pos­ing po­si­tions. He cites a pa­tient who dis­agreed about the need to take med­i­ca­tion, but was able to agree to a goal of stay­ing out of the hos­pi­tal and how con­sis­tently tak­ing med­i­ca­tion could help to achieve that.</p>
    <p>And should no com­pro­mise be reached, Prof Amador urges us to apol­o­gise for, and ac­knowl­edge, the dif­fer­ence in opin­ions and per­spec­tives and “to agree to dis­agree”.</p>
    <p>Most men­tal health pro­fes­sion­als like my­self have tried that tech­nique with our pa­tients. Some­times we do get some­where with some of them, and at other times not at all.</p>
    <p>It is in this lat­ter sit­u­a­tion that we find our­selves mired in a moral im­passe of try­ing to bal­ance the pa­tients’ rights and the need to treat them.</p>
    <p>From one per­spec­tive, the pa­tients’ lack of aware­ness of their ill­ness is ev­i­dence enough that they are men­tally not com­pe­tent and have been dis­pos­sessed of that true sense of au­ton­omy, and en­forc­ing treat­ment will re­store their ca­pac­ity for self-de­ter­mi­na­tion and au­ton­omy.</p>
    <p>A widely cited jus­ti­fi­ca­tion for com­pul­sory treat­ment is the “thank-you the­ory”, which as­sumes that pa­tients will, upon get­ting bet­ter, agree that the in­ter­ven­tion was in their best in­ter­ests. But only about half of pa­tients who have been in­vol­un­tar­ily hos­pi­talised sub­se­quently say they needed the treat­ment.</p>
    <p>ADVANCE DI­REC­TIVES</p>
    <p>So, in­sight might not nec­es­sar­ily be re­stored with treat­ment; it may re­main in­tractably lack­ing or fol­low some un­fath­omable will of its own, but in most in­stances, it re­cedes with the ap­pear­ance and wors­en­ing of the men­tal ill­ness.</p>
    <p>And when in­sight goes, the pa­tient’s rea­son­able­ness and will­ing­ness to ac­cept treat­ment also van­ishes, and un­less there is im­mi­nent dan­ger to self or oth­ers, in which case we can re­sort to men­tal health laws to com­mit the per­son, there is of­ten lit­tle we can do.</p>
    <p>In her per­sonal mem­oir, An Un­quiet Mind, Amer­i­can clin­i­cal psy­chol­o­gist and writer Kay Red­field Jami­son de­scribes her long strug­gle with bipo­lar dis­or­der.</p>
    <p>On the on­set of her ma­nia, she writes: “I lost my mind rather rapidly... I raced about like a crazed weasel, bub­bling with plans and en­thu­si­asms... and mak­ing ex­pan­sive, com­pletely un­re­al­is­tic plans for my fu­ture.”</p>
    <p>And later, she re­lates how “with a dead heart and a brain like a lump of clay”, she fell into de­pres­sion. De­spite hav­ing re­peat­edly caused chaos and up­heavals in her per­sonal and pro­fes­sional life, she re­sisted treat­ment for her ill­ness.</p>
    <p>Only much later did she make a clear writ­ten agree­ment with her psy­chi­a­trist and her fam­ily which stip­u­lates that if ever again she is se­ri­ously ill, she has granted per­mis­sion – against her will, if nec­es­sary – for her to be forcibly ad­mit­ted to hos­pi­tal and given elec­tro­con­vul­sive ther­apy.</p>
    <p>What she has put in place is an advance di­rec­tive. The idea un­der­ly­ing advance di­rec­tives is that they en­able doc­tors to know the wishes and val­ues of their pa­tients con­cern­ing what treat­ment choices they would want when ren­dered in­com­pe­tent by their ill­ness.</p>
    <p>The moral author­ity of advance di­rec­tives rests on the eth­i­cal prin­ci­ple of re­spect for the pa­tient’s au­ton­omy.</p>
    <p>The pro­to­type of a psy­chi­atric advance di­rec­tive is the so-called Ulysses con­tract, which is an in­stru­ment of giv­ing in­struc­tions and con­sent in advance, and named af­ter the wily strate­gist, for­mi­da­ble war­rior and long-suf­fer­ing hero of Homer’s epic poem, The Odyssey.</p>
    <p>Ulysses wanted to hear the singing of the sirens, who with their song be­witched and lured sailors to their deaths on the rocks. He made a pact with his men. He plugged their ears with wax so they could not hear the sirens, and had them tie him to his ship’s mast.</p>
    <p>Un­der a Ulysses con­tract, the pa­tient and the psy­chi­a­trist agree prospec­tively on when and what nec­es­sary in­ter­ven­tions are to be car­ried out when the pa­tient be­comes un­well and in­com­pe­tent – even if the pa­tient then re­fuses.</p>
    <p>In prac­tice, there are var­i­ous eth­i­cal and le­gal is­sues when it comes to ex­e­cut­ing such a con­tract. There is also the prob­lem that peo­ple at the other ex­treme could use this to re­ject any fu­ture treat­ment in all cir­cum­stances.</p>
    <p>At this point, there is no such in­stru­ment avail­able in our men­tal health leg­is­la­tion in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>Oct 10 is World Men­tal Health Day and this year, the theme is Men­tal Health For All: Greater In­vest­ment – Greater Ac­cess.</p>
    <p>In the past 10 years, the</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore Gov­ern­ment has im­ple­mented a num­ber of men­tal health poli­cies and pro­grammes as part of its con­tin­u­ing ef­forts to en­cour­age peo­ple to seek help and to re­duce the dis­ease bur­den of men­tal ill­nesses.</p>
    <p>A com­mu­nity men­tal health mas­ter­plan was rolled out to im­prove ac­cess to men­tal health ser­vices in the com­mu­nity and pri­mary health­care sec­tor.</p>
    <p>There has been much in­vest­ment, and much has been done.</p>
    <p>An ex­ten­sive phar­ma­copoeia of ef­fec­tive med­i­ca­tions and an ar­ray of ev­i­dence-based psy­choso­cial ther­a­pies are avail­able, but we have a prob­lem of ac­cess and an irony – what we still have not been able to over­come is get­ting these treat­ments to in­di­vid­u­als who need them but think that they don’t.</p>
    <p>Per­haps we should think about hav­ing a ver­sion of the Ulysses con­tract.</p>
    <p>The pact that Ulysses made worked: Bound to the mast, he heard the sirens singing and was driven tem­po­rar­ily in­sane. But he re­cov­ered, and in time, he made it back home.</p>
    <p>Pro­fes­sor Chong Siow Ann, a psy­chi­a­trist, is vice-chair­man of the med­i­cal board (re­search) at the In­sti­tute of Men­tal Health.</p>
