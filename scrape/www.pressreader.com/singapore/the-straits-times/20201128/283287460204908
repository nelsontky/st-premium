    <p>LONDON • Bri­tain’s 100-year-old char­ity hero Cap­tain Tom Moore and mo­tor racing cham­pion Lewis Hamilton have topped GQ mag­a­zine’s Men of the Year Awards.</p>
    <p>The men’s fash­ion and style mag­a­zine also hon­oured cam­paign­ing soccer player Mar­cus Rash­ford and ac­tress Lashana Lynch, among oth­ers, at a vir­tual cer­e­mony broad­cast on Thurs­day via its YouTube chan­nel and hosted by co­me­dian Jack White­hall.</p>
    <p>GQ named vet­eran singer, song­writer and TV per­son­al­ity Ozzy Osbourne as win­ner of its life­time achieve­ment award.</p>
    <p>Moore, a World War II vet­eran, won the In­spi­ra­tion cat­e­gory after rais­ing £32 mil­lion (S$57 mil­lion) for Bri­tain’s health ser­vice and char­i­ties at the height of the coro­n­avirus pan­demic by walk­ing laps of his gar­den.</p>
    <p>Since his walk­ing feat, he has been knighted by Queen El­iz­a­beth, scored a No. 1 sin­gle, writ­ten a book and signed a deal to film a biopic of his life. Last month, he launched a pod­cast se­ries to tackle iso­la­tion among the el­derly.</p>
    <p>Hamilton, 35, the most suc­cess­ful grand prix racing driver and the only black driver in For­mula One, won GQ’s Game Changer award. He has used his plat­form to cam­paign for racial equal­ity, diver­sity and en­vi­ron­men­tal sus­tain­abil­ity.</p>
    <p>“De­spite win­ning more races than any­one else across an im­pres­sive 14 sea­sons in For­mula One, it’s Lewis Hamilton’s ac­tions off the cir­cuit that make him GQ’s Game Changer of the Year,” said Mr Dylan Jones, the mag­a­zine’s edi­tor.</p>
    <p>Among oth­ers hon­oured on Thurs­day, Cap­tain Mar­vel (2019) star Lynch was named Break­through Ac­tress and Paul Mescal, who starred in ro­man­tic TV se­ries Nor­mal Peo­ple, won Break­through Ac­tor. Bri­tish-Nige­rian ac­tor John Boyega took GQ’s Icon award.</p>
    <p>Manch­ester United player Rash­ford clinched the Cam­paigner award for his work in help­ing to tackle child hunger and home­less­ness in Bri­tain.</p>
    <p>Mr Pa­trick Hutchin­son, a Black Lives Mat­ter ac­tivist and per­sonal trainer who res­cued a white man dur­ing vi­o­lent clashes in London in the sum­mer, won the Hu­man­i­tar­ian award.</p>
    <p>This is the 23rd year of the GQ Men of the Year Awards, which was or­gan­ised in as­so­ci­a­tion with Hugo Boss. (Clock­wise from far left) Char­ity hero Cap­tain</p>
