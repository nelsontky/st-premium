    <p>•</p>
    <p>Aus­tralia has re­sponded de­fi­antly to China im­pos­ing anti-dump­ing tar­iffs on Aus­tralian wine, say­ing the “se­ri­ously con­cern­ing devel­op­ment” looks to be about diplo­matic griev­ances and not any ac­tion by wine­mak­ers.</p>
    <p>China will i mpose tem­po­rary anti-dump­ing tar­iffs of 107.1 per cent to 212.1 per cent on wine im­ported from Aus­tralia from to­day, the Chi­nese Min­istry of Com­merce said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Aus­tralia’s Trade Min­is­ter Si­mon Birm­ing­ham said the tar­iffs were un­jus­ti­fi­able and it was a distress­ing time for hun­dreds of wine pro­duc­ers be­cause it “will ren­der un­vi­able for many busi­nesses, their wine trade with China”.</p>
    <p>China takes 37 per cent of Aus­tralia’s to­tal wine ex­ports, an in­dus­try worth A$2.9 bil­lion (S$2.86 bil­lion), the gov­ern­ment said.</p>
    <p>Last week, China out­lined a list of griev­ances about Aus­tralia’s for­eign in­vest­ment, na­tional se­cu­rity and hu­man rights pol­icy, say­ing Can­berra needed to cor­rect its ac­tions to re­store the bi­lat­eral re­la­tion­ship with its largest trad­ing part­ner.</p>
    <p>Aus­tralia’s Agri­cul­ture Min­is­ter David Lit­tleproud said: “China’s re­cent com­ments give the per­cep­tion that it’s more about their griev­ances around those mat­ters, rather than in fact around any­thing any in­dus­try has done wrong.”</p>
    <p>He added: “It just doesn’t worry Aus­tralian ex­porters, it wor­ries ex­porters from around the world.”</p>
    <p>China’s For­eign Min­istry spokesman Zhao Li­jian said yes­ter­day the mea­sures were in line with Chi­nese laws and reg­u­la­tions and urged Aus­tralia to do more to en­hance mu­tual trust.</p>
    <p>“They should think about whether they have re­spected China’s in­ter­ests,” he said.</p>
    <p>China be­gan an anti-dump­ing probe in Au­gust at the re­quest of the China Al­co­holic Drinks As­so­ci­a­tion, but in Can­berra, the pre­lim­i­nary de­ci­sion to im­pose tar­iffs was viewed as part of a pat­tern of puni­tive trade mea­sures since Aus­tralia called for an in­de­pen­dent in­quiry into the ori­gins of the coro­n­avirus.</p>
    <p>Mr Birm­ing­ham pointed to “the cu­mu­la­tive im­pact of China’s trade sanc­tions against a num­ber of Aus­tralian in­dus­tries” and said if they were a re­sponse to other fac­tors, this would be “com­pletely in­com­pat­i­ble with the com­mit­ments</p>
    <p>China has given” to the World Trade Or­gan­i­sa­tion.</p>
    <p>This year, China has im­posed tar­iffs on Aus­tralian bar­ley and sus­pended meat im­ports, and Chi­nese im­porters were told to ex­pect cus­toms de­lays across seven cate</p>
    <p>gories of prod­ucts from coal to seafood from this month.</p>
    <p>A wine im­porter in Shang­hai said: “I will stop im­port­ing Aus­tralian wines for at least three months to see how things go.”</p>
