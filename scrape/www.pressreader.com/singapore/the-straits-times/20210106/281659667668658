    <p>The rev­e­la­tion that TraceTo­gether data can be used for po­lice in­ves­ti­ga­tions has raised ques­tions over trust in gov­ern­ment, es­pe­cially in re­la­tion to data pri­vacy, said ob­servers yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>As­so­ciate Pro­fes­sor Eu­gene Tan from the Sin­ga­pore Man­age­ment Univer­sity (SMU) said the news came across as the Gov­ern­ment back­track­ing on its ear­lier as­sur­ance that TraceTo­gether would be used only for con­tact trac­ing.</p>
    <p>“It clearly un­der­mines their trust and cred­i­bil­ity,” said the for­mer Nom­i­nated MP.</p>
    <p>“This dam­age could un­der­mine its fu­ture ef­forts, given its re­it­er­a­tion that Sin­ga­pore has only man­aged to keep Covid-19 un­der con­trol due to the peo­ple’s trust in the Gov­ern­ment’s mea­sures.”</p>
    <p>For­mer Nom­i­nated MP Calvin Cheng said in a Face­book post that the Gov­ern­ment “should have been up­front that some pri­vacy will be sac­ri­ficed for safety and se­cu­rity”.</p>
    <p>Af­ter Min­is­ter of State for Home Af­fairs Des­mond Tan on</p>
    <p>Mon­day said po­lice are em­pow­ered un­der the Crim­i­nal Pro­ce­dure Code (CPC) to ob­tain TraceTo­gether data for crim­i­nal in­ves­ti­ga­tions, ne­ti­zens were quick to cite re­marks by Min­is­ter-in­charge of the Smart Na­tion Ini­tia­tive Vi­vian Balakrishn­an dur­ing a June 8 press con­fer­ence.</p>
    <p>He had said then that TraceTo­gether data would be used “purely for con­tact trac­ing, pe­riod”.</p>
    <p>Ad­dress­ing the House yes­ter­day, Dr Balakrishn­an said: “Frankly, I had not thought of the CPC when I spoke ear­lier.”</p>
    <p>Na­tional Univer­sity of Sin­ga­pore so­ci­ol­o­gist Tan Ern Ser noted that Sin­ga­pore­ans gen­er­ally have a high de­gree of trust in the Gov­ern­ment.</p>
    <p>But he sug­gested that an ad­di­tional layer of safe­guards should be cre­ated to al­lay con­cerns about data pri­vacy, and make sure such data is not mis­used.</p>
    <p>This could come in the form of a com­mit­tee com­pris­ing prom­i­nent pub­lic fig­ures to which the po­lice would be ac­count­able to, should they plan to use the TraceTo­gether data, he said.</p>
    <p>“I don’t think there’s an easy, straight­for­ward re­sponse to this is­sue,” he added. “The best safe­guard, in my view, is the de­gree to which cit­i­zens trust the Gov­ern­ment and po­lice that any data col­lected would only be used to pro­tect cit­i­zens, rather than against them.”</p>
    <p>Ms Sheena Ja­cob, a part­ner at law firm CMS Hol­born Asia, said that peo­ple’s con­cerns about how their TraceTo­gether data could be used is a com­mu­ni­ca­tions and pub­lic re­la­tions is­sue.</p>
    <p>She called for bet­ter clar­ity around how this data will be used, to pro­vide as­sur­ance to Sin­ga­pore­ans and en­cour­age them to par­tic­i­pate in the na­tional con­tact trac­ing pro­gramme.</p>
    <p>SMU’s Prof Tan sug­gested that the Gov­ern­ment ex­clude TraceTo­gether data from the CPC’s am­bit, given its orig­i­nal in­tended use for con­tact trac­ing as well as the need to con­vince as many peo­ple as pos­si­ble to get on it.</p>
    <p>He added: “A by-the-way or in­ci­den­tal use of TraceTo­gether should be re­sisted be­cause it is far more im­por­tant to have many peo­ple use the pro­gramme.”</p>
    <p>But others noted that TraceTo­gether data is not the only piece of in­for­ma­tion that the au­thor­i­ties can re­quest, and that the law al­lows the po­lice to ask for any doc­u­ment or data they deem nec­es­sary for in­ves­ti­ga­tions.</p>
    <p>Mr Gil­bert Leong, a se­nior part­ner at law firm Den­tons Rodyk & David­son, said it was not prac­ti­cal for the Gov­ern­ment to re­view the law and de­clare to the pub­lic the ef­fect of ex­ist­ing laws on new ini­tia­tives each time it launches some­thing like TraceTo­gether.</p>
    <p>He added that there was no back­track­ing of pre­vi­ous as­sur­ances from the Gov­ern­ment.</p>
    <p>While the Gov­ern­ment only uses TraceTo­gether data for con­tact trac­ing, it can­not ig­nore pro­vi­sions in the law to use the data for law en­force­ment, he said.</p>
    <p>Lawyers who spoke to The Straits Times echoed a point that Dr Balakrishn­an made on how the CPC ap­plies not only to TraceTo­gether, but to other kinds of sen­si­tive data pro­tected by pri­vacy laws such as phone or bank­ing records.</p>
    <p>Mr Jonathan Kok, a tech­nol­ogy lawyer at Withers Khat­tarWong, said that the po­lice have al­ways been em­pow­ered un­der the CPC to is­sue a writ­ten or­der to re­quire a per­son to pro­duce any doc­u­ment or data they be­lieve is nec­es­sary for their in­ves­ti­ga­tions.</p>
    <p>“So if the po­lice re­quire a per­son to pro­duce his TraceTo­gether de­vice for their in­ves­ti­ga­tions, they are al­ready em­pow­ered to do so un­der the CPC,” he said.</p>
    <p>NO EASY ANSWER</p>
    <p>I don’t think there’s an easy, straight­for­ward re­sponse to this is­sue. The best safe­guard, in my view, is the de­gree to which cit­i­zens trust the Gov­ern­ment and po­lice that any data col­lected would only be used to pro­tect cit­i­zens, rather than against them.</p>
