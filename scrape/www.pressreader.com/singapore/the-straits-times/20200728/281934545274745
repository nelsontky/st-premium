    <p>SYD­NEY • Elab­o­rate “vir­tual kid­nap­pings” are be­ing used to ex­tort money from friends and rel­a­tives of Chi­nese stu­dents Down Un­der, Aus­tralian po­lice warned yes­ter­day, af­ter a spate of transna­tional scams was re­ported.</p>
    <p>Po­lice said con­men claim­ing to be the Chi­nese au­thor­i­ties had net­ted mil­lions of US dol­lars in ran­soms by scar­ing stu­dents into fak­ing their own kid­nap­pings.</p>
    <p>The scam­mers – of­ten speak­ing Man­darin and claim­ing to be from the Chi­nese em­bassy, po­lice or con­sulate – ini­tially say the vic­tim is ac­cused of a crime in China or tell him his iden­tity has been stolen, be­fore threat­en­ing him with de­por­ta­tion or ar­rest un­less a fee is paid.</p>
    <p>Po­lice said the fraud­sters then con­tinue to threaten the vic­tim, of­ten over en­crypted mes­sage ser­vices, un­til he trans­fers large sums into off­shore bank ac­counts.</p>
    <p>In some cases, vic­tims were told to cease con­tact with friends and rel­a­tives, then make videos of them­selves tied up and blind­folded, with the con­men us­ing the footage to de­mand ran­soms.</p>
    <p>Po­lice said at least eight cases have led to more than A$3 mil­lion (S$2.95 mil­lion) in ran­som pay­ments this year in Aus­tralia.</p>
    <p>Other in­ci­dents have been de­tected else­where around the world. Aus­tralian po­lice said the scams had been “de­vel­oped con­sid­er­ably over the last decade by transna­tional or­gan­ised crime syn­di­cates”.</p>
    <p>Vic­tims are “trau­ma­tised by what has oc­curred, believ­ing they have placed them­selves, and their loved ones, in real dan­ger”, New South Wales Po­lice as­sis­tant com­mis­sioner Peter Thurtell said.</p>
    <p>Over 1,000 “Chi­nese au­thor­ity” scams were recorded last year by Aus­tralia’s con­sumer watch­dog.</p>
    <p>Ex­iled Chi­nese dis­si­dents and mem­bers of per­se­cuted eth­nic groups have also re­ported such ha­rass­ment, in­clud­ing threat­en­ing phone calls.</p>
    <p>Chi­nese of­fi­cials said no au­thor­ity would con­tact stu­dents on their mo­bile phones to de­mand money.</p>
    <p>The warn­ing comes as Aus­tralia’s univer­sity sec­tor tries to at­tract back in­ter­na­tional stu­dents on­line and pre­pare for any pos­si­ble re­lax­ation of virus travel re­stric­tions.</p>
    <p>Ed­u­ca­tion is Aus­tralia’s fourth­largest trade – be­hind iron ore, coal and nat­u­ral gas – with more than 500,000 in­ter­na­tional stu­dents en­rolled last year, bring­ing about A$37 bil­lion to the econ­omy.</p>
    <p>The clo­sure of Aus­tralian bor­ders to trav­ellers due to the coro­n­avirus pan­demic has crip­pled the sec­tor. And Can­berra’s height­ened ten­sions with Bei­jing have fur­ther threat­ened the flow of stu­dents to Aus­tralia.</p>
    <p>Last month, China’s Min­istry of Ed­u­ca­tion warned stu­dents about “mul­ti­ple dis­crim­i­na­tory in­ci­dents against Asians in Aus­tralia” dur­ing the pan­demic and dis­cour­aged stu­dents from re­turn­ing to the coun­try when the bor­ders re­opened.</p>
