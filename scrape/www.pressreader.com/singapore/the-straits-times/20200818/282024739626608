    <p>When the Covid-19 pan­demic is fi­nally over, what will we have learnt? Health­care pro­fes­sion­als have done their best to cope with the un­prece­dented chal­lenge posed by Covid-19, and in many cases their per­for­mance and con­duct have been truly heroic. But there have been mis­steps, too, and train­ing the next gen­er­a­tion of physi­cians will re­quire a new par­a­digm for med­i­cal ed­u­ca­tion.</p>
    <p>What ad­di­tional skills will fu­ture physi­cians need to nav­i­gate the post-pan­demic world? The an­swer lies in a more prag­matic, holis­tic and re­al­is­tic “world view” as to what con­sti­tutes good health based on the fol­low­ing key con­cepts.</p>
    <p>HOLIS­TIC VIEW</p>
    <p>For physi­cians of the fu­ture, the nar­row view of clin­i­cal com­pe­tence and the abil­ity to di­ag­nose and cure dis­ease will not be enough. They must ac­quire a more in­te­grated un­der­stand­ing of what con­sti­tutes good health, be re­minded of the “hu­man­ity” in medicine, and af­firm the prin­ci­ple that healthy lives in­clude phys­i­cal, men­tal, so­cial and spir­i­tual well-be­ing.</p>
    <p>This goal will re­quire a more so­ci­etal and “sys­tems-based think­ing” ap­proach. Doc­tors will need to ap­pre­ci­ate not only the in­flu­ence of so­cial de­ter­mi­nants but also that of rapidly evolv­ing sec­tors be­yond health.</p>
    <p>Im­por­tantly, in an age of un­prece­dented tech­no­log­i­cal in­no­va­tions in big data, ar­ti­fi­cial in­tel­li­gence and in­for­mat­ics, they will have to un­der­stand the in­valu­able role these driv­ers will play in fu­ture health im­prove­ment.</p>
    <p>This first goal can be achieved through teach­ing in­no­va­tions that re­store hu­man­ity in medicine by, for ex­am­ple, high­light­ing the in­ter­sec­tion be­tween health and art. In ad­di­tion, a greater aware­ness of the his­tory of hu­man health and medicine will lead to bet­ter de­ci­sion-making. As Span­ish-Amer­i­can philoso­pher Ge­orge San­tayana fa­mously said: “Those who can­not re­mem­ber the past are con­demned to re­peat it.”</p>
    <p>CRIT­I­CAL IN­QUIRY</p>
    <p>The sec­ond con­cept de­rives from the cur­rent toxic en­vi­ron­ment of mis­in­for­ma­tion, false­hoods, pseudo-sci­en­tific “facts” and the out­right de­nial of science it­self.</p>
    <p>Fu­ture physi­cians must guard the sanc­tity of in­quiry, crit­i­cal think­ing and sci­en­tific ev­i­dence in guid­ing de­ci­sion-making. Fu­ture physi­cians must also be “data savvy” and be able to tap into the de­tailed health data avail­able at both the na­tional and global lev­els.</p>
    <p>In the larger con­text of how pub­lic poli­cies im­pact so­ci­ety, fu­ture physi­cians must also be aware of the role and value of ev­i­dence in shap­ing such poli­cies within the health sec­tor and be­yond. The need to have an in­quir­ing mind was suc­cinctly ex­pressed by Amer­i­can physi­cist Richard Feyn­man who said: “I would rather have ques­tions that can’t be an­swered than an­swers that can’t be ques­tioned.”</p>
    <p>The goal of de­vel­op­ing an in­quir­ing mind can be achieved, for ex­am­ple, by ex­pos­ing stu­dents to the prin­ci­ples and foun­da­tions of the sci­en­tific method, par­a­digms of re­search and by re­quir­ing stu­dent-driven re­search projects.</p>
    <p>GLOBAL MIND­SET</p>
    <p>Be­yond the shores of a small is­land like Sin­ga­pore, and as elo­quently ex­pressed by former Sin­ga­pore diplo­mat Kishore Mah­bubani, the “coro­n­avirus is telling us to be a cit­i­zen of our coun­try, and our world”. “The dis­ease has shaken the hu­man species to the core, but we must grasp the meta­phys­i­cal mes­sages it is send­ing. To sur­vive in the short term, we need na­tional sol­i­dar­ity – but to sur­vive in the long term, we need global sol­i­dar­ity.”</p>
    <p>The third goal, there­fore, in the train­ing of fu­ture physi­cians, is that they must be­come global-minded lead­ers con­tribut­ing to the bet­ter­ment of well-be­ing for hu­man­ity as a whole.</p>
    <p>They should be aware not just of mat­ters re­lated to “global health”, but also of ex­is­ten­tial chal­lenges in the much larger con­text of “plan­e­tary health”.</p>
    <p>This ob­jec­tive can be achieved by in­tro­duc­ing rel­e­vant top­ics through­out the cur­ricu­lum which go be­yond tra­di­tional bio­med­i­cal and clin­i­cal di­men­sions. These cour­ses should in­clude eco­nom­ics, devel­op­ment, busi­ness, his­tory, pol­i­tics, be­havioural sciences and ecol­ogy, among oth­ers.</p>
    <p>AT­TI­TUDE OF HU­MIL­ITY</p>
    <p>Fi­nally, to achieve these cru­cial goals for the next gen­er­a­tion of physi­cians, ed­u­ca­tors must adopt a sim­i­lar at­ti­tude of hu­mil­ity. De­fen­sive re­ac­tions to med­i­cal stu­dents’ ques­tions are coun­ter­pro­duc­tive. In­stead, ed­u­ca­tors should ex­em­plify the em­pa­thy ex­pected of these fu­ture doc­tors and en­cour­age them in their as­pi­ra­tions. Tra­di­tional di­dac­tic ap­proaches should be re­placed by project and group work led by the stu­dents them­selves.</p>
    <p>In the post-pan­demic era, on­line teach­ing and hy­brid classes are likely to be­come the norm. To keep stu­dents en­gaged, ed­u­ca­tors will need to em­ploy new teach­ing meth­ods, such as in­ter­ac­tive tasks, break­out ses­sions and thought ex­per­i­ments. The com­ing aca­demic year will test ed­u­ca­tors’ hu­mil­ity, agility and adapt­abil­ity.</p>
    <p>In­deed, the pan­demic presents an op­por­tu­nity to de­velop a new par­a­digm for med­i­cal ed­u­ca­tion.</p>
    <p>It is no longer suf­fi­cient for physi­cians of the fu­ture to com­mit to the dic­tum of “first, do no harm”. They must em­brace a broader mind­set of “first, do good for hu­man­ity” – to value hu­mil­ity, in­quiry and sol­i­dar­ity in or­der to help en­sure the well-be­ing and sur­vival of the hu­man species. lec­turer and as­sis­tant dean (ed­u­ca­tion); and Pro­fes­sor Chong Yap Seng is dean, all from the Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine, Na­tional Uni­ver­sity of Sin­ga­pore.</p>
