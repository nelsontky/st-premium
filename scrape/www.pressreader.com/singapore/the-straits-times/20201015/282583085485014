    <p>TAIPEI • Is Tai­wanese singer Phil Chang paving the way for his son’s en­try into the en­ter­tain­ment in­dus­try?</p>
    <p>Chang, who is fa­mous for songs such as Well-In­ten­tioned, It’s A Long Story and Trou­bled By The Moon, has sel­dom posted pho­tos of his two sons on­line dur­ing his 27 years in en­ter­tain­ment.</p>
    <p>How­ever, the 53-year-old, who took part in the Chi­nese show I Am A Singer (Sea­son 2) in 2014 as a host and con­tes­tant, did so on Sun­day.</p>
    <p>He posted on Weibo sev­eral pho­tos of him­self with his older son, who is cel­e­brat­ing his 22nd birth­day.</p>
    <p>The singer is mar­ried to lyri­cist Tracy Hsiao, who is bet­ter known as Shi Yi-lang.</p>
    <p>Chang wrote in Chi­nese, “Be­cause I love you so much, I have learnt to give you back to your­self. Happy birth­day, Brother Chiu.”</p>
    <p>He did not men­tion his son’s full name.</p>
    <p>He had said in an in­ter­view with Taiwan’s Ap­ple Daily 12 years ago that he was a strict fa­ther who would dis­ci­pline his son.</p>
    <p>Many fans wished Chang’s son a happy birth­day. They took note of his good looks and won­dered if show busi­ness is on the cards for him.</p>
    <p>Hsiao also wished her son a happy birth­day on Weibo. She wrote in Chi­nese: “At the age of 22, you are still kind and con­sid­er­ate, but also more un­der­stand­ing.</p>
    <p>“I be­lieve that you are here for me so that I can use a dif­fer­ent per­spec­tive to look at life. Thank you, you are re­ally the best gift in my life.”</p>
