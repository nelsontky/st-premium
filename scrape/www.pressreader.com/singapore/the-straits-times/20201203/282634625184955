    <p>On Nov 8, 2018, a fe­ro­cious blaze that came to be known as the Camp Fire en­gulfed the town of Par­adise in north­ern Cal­i­for­nia.</p>
    <p>It was the worst fire in Cal­i­for­nia his­tory and the dead­li­est Amer­ica had seen in a hun­dred years, raz­ing al­most all struc­tures and dis­plac­ing nearly 50,000 res­i­dents. And it killed 85 peo­ple, four of whom burned to death in their cars as they fled.</p>
    <p>At a vir­tual press event, Os­car­win­ning di­rec­tor Ron Howard (A Beau­ti­ful Mind, 2001, above) and sur­vivors of the fire ex­plain why they made Re­build­ing Par­adise, an ac­claimed doc­u­men­tary now stream­ing on Fox+.</p>
    <p>It tells the heart­break­ing but in­spir­ing tale of how the towns­folk ral­lied to­gether to pick up the pieces and re­build their home.</p>
    <p>1 DI­REC­TOR RON HOWARD HAS MADE A MOVIE ABOUT FIRES BE­FORE</p>
    <p>Howard had di­rected Back­draft (1991), an Os­car-nom­i­nated ac­tion thriller about a group of fire­fight­ers.</p>
    <p>The movie gave him a healthy re­spect for fire, says the 66-year-old.</p>
    <p>“Mak­ing Back­draft un­der highly con­trolled cir­cum­stances, I cer­tainly learnt to re­spect how quickly fire can get away from you. We had a cou­ple of very near misses with that, as con­trolled as we were try­ing to be.”</p>
    <p>He first learnt of the Camp Fire over the news, then trav­elled to the area a week or so later.</p>
    <p>“I’d never ex­pe­ri­enced any­thing like what I wit­nessed there; be­ing sur­rounded by that level of de­struc­tion re­ally does take your breath away. And words, they don’t suf­fice,” says the film-maker, who also di­rected the space drama Apollo 13 (1995).</p>
    <p>2 HE THOSE WANTS WHO TO SUR­VIVED GIVE A VOICE TO</p>
    <p>Howard de­scribes his con­ver­sa­tions with the sur­vivors as “sober­ing and un­com­fort­able in the ex­treme”.</p>
    <p>“But one of the things I found is that many peo­ple did want the cathar­sis of talk­ing about it. They did want to share their videos with us.</p>
    <p>“Then they be­gan to recog­nise that we didn’t want to make a film just about the cri­sis – we wanted to make a film about the peo­ple and what it was go­ing to re­quire to cope with this, whether it was leav­ing, stay­ing or re­build­ing.”</p>
    <p>3 IT IS A STORY OF LO­CAL HE­ROES</p>
    <p>One of the sub­jects of the film is Par­adise res­i­dent Steve “Woody” Cul­leton, a colour­ful char­ac­ter who went from be­ing one of the town drunks to its three-time mayor and a cen­tral fig­ure in its re­cov­ery.</p>
    <p>Be­cause of his heart­felt con­nec­tion to the place, Cul­leton chose to stay and re­build a new home there af­ter the fire.</p>
    <p>“I got to Par­adise on a bus in 1981. Shortly af­ter ar­riv­ing here, I sobered up and was able to marry and even­tu­ally go on and be elected to pub­lic of­fice.</p>
    <p>“Why it’s im­por­tant to be here is be­cause this is my home,” he says, cry­ing. “This is where I put my life back to­gether. It’s where our fam­i­lies are safe and the com­mu­nity is like a great big fam­ily.</p>
    <p>“And in this pan­demic, it’s a great bub­ble to be in. That’s why I’m here.”</p>
    <p>4 HOWARD CON­NEC­TION HAS TO A PER­SONAL THE FIRE</p>
    <p>The di­rec­tor has many rel­a­tives in Red­ding, another town struck by the Camp Fire, and his late mother-in-law lived the last few years of her life in Par­adise it­self.</p>
    <p>“So I felt a per­sonal con­nec­tion im­me­di­ately,” he said.</p>
    <p>5 HE HAD NEVER MADE A FILM WITH­OUT KNOW­ING THE END­ING</p>
    <p>Howard has made doc­u­men­taries be­fore, in­clud­ing the mu­si­cal biog­ra­phy Pavarotti (2019), but this is his first done in cin­ema verite style, mean­ing it is more ob­ser­va­tional and “fly on the wall”.</p>
    <p>“Pre­vi­ously, I’d done doc­u­men­taries where you know more or less where you’re go­ing. It’s closer to do­ing a scripted film, which you’re go­ing to con­trol, stage, re­write, re-edit and ma­nip­u­late,” he says.</p>
    <p>With this one, the con­clu­sion took shape only dur­ing the pro­duc­tion process, some­thing Howard is not used to.</p>
    <p>Af­ter gath­er­ing lots of footage and in­ter­view­ing the sur­vivors, he found him­self ask­ing his pro­duc­ers, doc­u­men­tary veter­ans Sarah Bern­stein and Xan Parker, “Do we know where we’re go­ing?”</p>
    <p>“And they say, ‘No, of course we don’t’, and kind of look at me like I’m a rookie,” he re­calls.</p>
    <p>“I’m used to hav­ing the third act there in the script, but they said, ‘No, we’re fol­low­ing it, and it’s hap­pen­ing.’”</p>
    <p>Re­build­ing Par­adise is avail­able on Fox+.</p>
