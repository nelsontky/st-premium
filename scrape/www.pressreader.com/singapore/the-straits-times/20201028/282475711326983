    <p>Stars of South Korean drama 18 Again talk about what they would do if they had a chance to go back in time Jan Lee</p>
    <p>Ev­ery­one wishes they could have done some­thing dif­fer­ently in their lives.</p>
    <p>In the K-drama 18 Again, a mid­dle-aged man on the brink of di­vorce sud­denly be­comes 18 again. South Korean ac­tor Yoon Sanghyun plays Hong Dae-young, who en­coun­ters his wife Jung Da-jung (ac­tress Kim Ha-neul) as his younger self (played by ac­tor Lee Do-hyun).</p>
    <p>Here are five things to know about the cast and the se­ries, which is avail­able on Viu.</p>
    <p>1</p>
    <p>RE­MAKE OF AMER­I­CAN COM­EDY</p>
    <p>The se­ries 18 Again takes its premise from the 2009 Amer­i­can com­edy film 17 Again, star­ring Matthew Perry and Zac Efron, but the cast says the South Korean adap­ta­tion leaves its own stamp on the ma­te­rial.</p>
    <p>Kim (A Gen­tle­man’s Dig­nity, 2012), 42, tells The Straits Times over e-mail: “17 Again was re­ally fun but 18 Again was re­made to be warmer and more fam­ily-cen­tred.”</p>
    <p>Yoon (Se­cret Gar­den, 2010) says of the orig­i­nal: “I watched it be­fore I got mar­ried for fun, but af­ter get­ting mar­ried, hav­ing chil­dren and rais­ing them, I was able to em­pathise with the script more.”</p>
    <p>The 47-year-old is mar­ried to South Korean singer MayBee and they have two daugh­ters and a son.</p>
    <p>2</p>
    <p>LEE DO-HYUN’S RE­GRET</p>
    <p>The younger ver­sion of Dae-young that Da-jung’s 37-year-old hus­band is trapped in is played by ris­ing star Lee (Ho­tel Del Luna, 2019).</p>
    <p>Asked if there is an age he would like to re­turn to, the 25-year-old says: “I don’t think I’ll choose to wear glasses if I get to go back and be in third grade in ele­men­tary school again.</p>
    <p>“I’m still re­gret­ting it as my eye­sight got worse af­ter wear­ing horn­rimmed glasses, which were trendy at that time.”</p>
    <p>3</p>
    <p>KIM HA-NEUL’S WAN­DER­LUST</p>
    <p>Kim says she would like to go back to be­ing 18, like in the drama se­ries, and try back­pack­ing for once.</p>
    <p>She says: “I love trav­el­ling. And wouldn’t I be happy if I could see and feel more with a health­ier body?”</p>
    <p>While both his co-stars would take the chance to re­turn to the past, Yoon would choose to stay in the present with his fam­ily – where he is the “happiest”.</p>
    <p>YOUNGER OPPA”</p>
    <p>Kim may be 17 years Lee’s se­nior, but she did not feel awk­ward film­ing ro­man­tic scenes with him.</p>
    <p>“I was wor­ried at first be­cause of our age dif­fer­ence, but he took good care of me on the set just like how an older brother (oppa in Korean) would. He was so sweet that I couldn’t feel our age dif­fer­ence,” she says.</p>
    <p>5</p>
    <p>GET­TING THEIR ACT TO­GETHER</p>
    <p>The se­ries sees Yoon and Lee play­ing the same char­ac­ter and they worked on align­ing their per­for­mances.</p>
    <p>Lee says: “I tried to catch the char­ac­ter­is­tics of Hong Dae-young as played by Yoon. I ob­served his foot­steps, habits, way of speech and prac­tised a lot in or­der to act it out as sim­i­larly as pos­si­ble.”</p>
    <p>Yoon recorded him­self to bet­ter his per­for­mance.</p>
    <p>He says: “It was my first time tak­ing on a role with a dou­ble, so I went through the script care­fully be­fore film­ing started. I was wor­ried about my tone be­ing dif­fer­ent from Do-hyun’s, so I recorded my own voice and prac­tised a lot.” 18 Again is avail­able on Viu.</p>
