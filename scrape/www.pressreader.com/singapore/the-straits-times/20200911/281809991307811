    <p>WASH­ING­TON • US Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump ac­knowl­edged to a jour­nal­ist early in the coro­n­avirus pan­demic that he played down the dan­ger of the health cri­sis de­spite hav­ing ev­i­dence to the con­trary, ac­cord­ing to a new book.</p>
    <p>“I wanted to al­ways play it down,” Mr Trump told au­thor Bob Wood­ward on March 19, days af­ter he de­clared a na­tional emer­gency. “I still like play­ing it down, be­cause I don’t want to cre­ate a panic.”</p>
    <p>CNN on Wed­nes­day broad­cast in­ter­views Mr Wood­ward did with Mr Trump for his new book Rage. The book, to go on sale next Tues­day, comes ahead of the pres­i­den­tial elec­tion on Nov 3 and amid crit­i­cism of Mr Trump’s ef­forts to bat­tle the coro­n­avirus pan­demic.</p>
    <p>The Repub­li­can Pres­i­dent, as­sailed by his Demo­cratic pres­i­den­tial ri­val Joe Bi­den over the slow US gov­ern­ment re­sponse to the virus, played down the cri­sis for months as it took hold and spread across the coun­try.</p>
    <p>In the con­ver­sa­tion, Mr Trump told Mr Wood­ward that some “star­tling facts” had emerged show­ing the ex­tent of those at risk: “It’s not just old, older. Young peo­ple too, plenty of young peo­ple.”</p>
    <p>Mr Trump on Wed­nes­day de­fended his han­dling of the virus, which has killed over 195,000 peo­ple in the US – the world’s high­est num­ber of deaths from the dis­ease.</p>
    <p>“The fact is I’m a cheer­leader for this coun­try. I love our coun­try and I don’t want peo­ple to be fright­ened,” he said. “We’ve done well from any stan­dard.”</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to the in­ter­views, CNN and The Wash­ing­ton Post re­ported, Mr Trump knew the virus was dan­ger­ous in early Fe­bru­ary.</p>
    <p>“It goes through the air,” Mr Trump said in a record­ing of a Feb 7 in­ter­view with Mr Wood­ward.</p>
    <p>“That’s al­ways tougher than the touch. You don’t have to touch things. Right? But the air, you just breathe the air and that’s how it’s passed... It’s also more deadly than even your stren­u­ous flus.”</p>
    <p>A week af­ter that in­ter­view, Mr Trump said at a White House brief­ing that the num­ber of US coro­n­avirus cases “within a cou­ple days is go­ing to be down close to zero”.</p>
    <p>Mr Wood­ward de­fended him­self from on­line crit­ics who ques­tioned why he kept Mr Trump’s com­ments to him­self for months as the pan­demic raged.</p>
    <p>“He tells me this, and I’m think­ing, ‘Wow, that’s in­ter­est­ing, but is it true?’ Trump says things that don’t check out, right?” the As­so­ci­ated Press quoted him as say­ing.</p>
    <p>Some fel­low Repub­li­cans de­fended Mr Trump.</p>
    <p>“His ac­tions of shut­ting the econ­omy down were the right ac­tions,” Sen­a­tor Lind­sey Gra­ham said. “And I think the tone dur­ing that time sort of spoke for it­self.”</p>
    <p>Mr Wood­ward con­ducted 18 in­ter­views with Mr Trump for the book. Other rev­e­la­tions in­clude his dis­parag­ing re­marks about US mil­i­tary lead­ers.</p>
    <p>The Pres­i­dent drew crit­i­cism this week fol­low­ing re­ports that he had den­i­grated fallen mil­i­tary per­son­nel and vet­er­ans.</p>
    <p>In the book, an aide to for­mer de­fence sec­re­tary James Mat­tis heard Mr Trump say in a meet­ing, “my f***ing gen­er­als are a bunch of p***ies” be­cause they cared more about al­liances than trade deals. Mr Mat­tis asked the aide to doc­u­ment the com­ment in an e-mail, The Wash­ing­ton Post re­ported.</p>
    <p>Re­gard­ing the Black Lives Mat­ter move­ment, Mr Wood­ward asked Mr Trump about his views on the con­cept of white priv­i­lege and if he felt iso­lated by that priv­i­lege from the plight of black Amer­i­cans.</p>
    <p>“No. You re­ally drank the KoolAid, didn’t you? Just lis­ten to you,” Mr Trump replied. “Wow. No, I don’t feel that at all.”</p>
    <p>Mr Bi­den on Wed­nes­day ac­cused Mr Trump of be­tray­ing the Amer­i­can peo­ple, say­ing he know­ingly lied about the dead­li­ness of the coro­n­avirus in what amounted to a “dere­lic­tion” of duty.</p>
    <p>“He knew, and pur­pose­fully played it down. Worse, he lied to the Amer­i­can peo­ple,” Mr Bi­den said in a speech in the bat­tle­ground state of Michi­gan.</p>
    <p>“And while this deadly dis­ease ripped through our na­tion, he failed to do his job – on pur­pose. It was a life-and-death be­trayal of the Amer­i­can peo­ple... It’s a dere­lic­tion of duty, a dis­grace.”</p>
    <p>Mr Bi­den and Mr Trump are ramp­ing up travel in the fi­nal sprint to the elec­tion dur­ing a pan­demic that has made wag­ing a tra­di­tional cam­paign all but im­pos­si­ble. The Pres­i­dent is ex­pected to visit Michi­gan and Penn­syl­va­nia later in the week.</p>
    <p>PRE­VENT­ING A PANIC</p>
    <p>The fact is I’m a cheer­leader for this coun­try. I love our coun­try and I don’t want peo­ple to be fright­ened. We’ve done well from any stan­dard.</p>

    <p>DERE­LIC­TION OF DUTY</p>
    <p>He knew, and pur­pose­fully played it down. Worse, he lied to the Amer­i­can peo­ple. And while this deadly dis­ease ripped through our na­tion, he failed to do his job – on pur­pose. It was a life-and-death be­trayal of the Amer­i­can peo­ple. It’s a dere­lic­tion of duty, a dis­grace.</p>
