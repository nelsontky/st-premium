    <p>The prize re­ally goes to my friends and col­leagues in the field and those who have died, while putting their lives on the line. The prize truly be­longs to them.</p>
    <p>Grow­ing up in Siglap, Ms Rathi Pala Kr­ish­nan, now 44, would some­times go along with her mother to the hos­pi­tal where she worked as a med­i­cal so­cial worker.</p>
    <p>The ex­pe­ri­ence left the Sin­ga­porean with an abid­ing re­spect for pub­lic ser­vice. Then a three-week youth mis­sion to Namibia when she was 18 set her on the path to where she is to­day, as a deputy direc­tor in the United Na­tions World Food Pro­gramme (WFP), this year’s No­bel Peace Prize win­ner.</p>
    <p>WFP was cited by the No­bel Com­mit­tee on Oct 9 “for its ef­forts to com­bat hunger, for its con­tri­bu­tion to bet­ter­ing con­di­tions for peace in con­flict-af­fected ar­eas and for act­ing as a driv­ing force in ef­forts to pre­vent the use of hunger as a weapon of war and con­flict”.</p>
    <p>The mother of four has been of­fi­cially based in Wash­ing­ton since Jan­uary but, be­cause of Covid-19, is cur­rently tele­work­ing from WFP’s head­quar­ters in Rome.</p>
    <p>“The United States govern­ment pro­vides a sig­nif­i­cant amount of fund­ing to WFP and I am re­spon­si­ble for help­ing to man­age and strengthen our part­ner­ship with them,” she said. The US con­trib­uted US$3.4 bil­lion (S$4.6 bil­lion) out of US$8 bil­lion re­ceived last year.</p>
    <p>She has worked with WFP in var­i­ous po­si­tions since June 2002, first in Rwanda, then Su­dan un­til April 2007 when she moved to Rome as the team lead for the tech­ni­cal/strat­egy unit in the Govern­ment Part­ner­ships divi­sion. She was also in Bangkok for four years be­fore re­turn­ing to Rome in 2015.</p>
    <p>She moved to Rwanda the day af­ter grad­u­at­ing with a mas­ter’s de­gree in pub­lic health from the Univer­sity of North Carolina in Chapel Hill.</p>
    <p>MS RATHI PALA KR­ISH­NAN, on how she feels about the UN World Food Pro­gramme win­ning the No­bel Peace Prize.</p>
    <p>She cites ad­just­ing to the way of life in the field – be it in East Ti­mor (now Ti­mor-Leste), Rwanda or Su­dan – as one of the chal­lenges of her work.</p>
    <p>An­other chal­lenge was be­com­ing a mother in 2007, and hav­ing to bal­ance mother­hood and a ca­reer.</p>
    <p>She is mar­ried with four chil­dren – Alexan­dre, seven, Julien, nine, Jade, who is al­most 12, and Max, 13.</p>
    <p>About what she wants, she said: “Most of all, bal­anc­ing my per­sonal and pro­fes­sional life in a way that serves to be mean­ing­ful on both fronts: I want sta­bil­ity for my fam­ily. The peo­ple we serve want the same for theirs.</p>
    <p>“It sounds quite sim­ple on the face of it, but the re­al­ity is that the world is mov­ing in the wrong di­rec­tion: Hunger is on the rise. There are 690 mil­lion peo­ple who are hungry and nearly all the world’s ma­jor food crises are driven by con­flict.</p>
    <p>“Con­flict and in­se­cu­rity – along with cli­mate shocks and eco­nomic tur­moil – are the main drivers of hunger.” She said WFP works where the world’s poor­est, most vul­ner­a­ble peo­ple live – pro­vid­ing food as a build­ing block of life and a cor­ner­stone for peace.</p>
    <p>The added di­men­sion of Covid-19 has drained the abil­ity of af­fected com­mu­ni­ties to cope. WFP es­ti­mates that the num­ber of peo­ple suf­fer­ing from acute food in­se­cu­rity could jump by 80 per cent to 270 mil­lion by the end of this year.</p>
    <p>“WFP served as the back­bone of the global re­sponse to Covid-19, en­abling or­gan­i­sa­tions to stay and de­liver through a net­work of hubs, pas­sen­ger and cargo air links and mede­vac ser­vices,” she said, not­ing that it fa­cil­i­tated a steady flow of hu­man­i­tar­ian and health cargo and work­ers to the front lines of the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Among the or­gan­i­sa­tions in­volved in the re­sponse were Sin­ga­pore Air­lines and Te­masek Foun­da­tion, she said.</p>
    <p>“Per­son­ally, I was and still am very emo­tional about WFP get­ting the No­bel Peace Prize. It’s a mix of ex­cite­ment, hap­pi­ness and, at the same time, a feel­ing of hu­mil­ity for this or­gan­i­sa­tion I es­sen­tially mar­ried and gave my adult life to.</p>
    <p>“The prize re­ally goes to my friends and col­leagues in the field and those who have died, while putting their lives on the line. The prize truly be­longs to them,” said Ms Rathi, whose father was the late se­nior coun­sel and former Law So­ci­ety pres­i­dent R. Pala Kr­ish­nan.</p>
    <p>“Hav­ing grown up in a fam­ily of ser­vice, I, too, wanted to make a dif­fer­ence. In my core, I knew I had to do some­thing else to make my life more mean­ing­ful, and most of all help oth­ers less for­tu­nate than me.”</p>
