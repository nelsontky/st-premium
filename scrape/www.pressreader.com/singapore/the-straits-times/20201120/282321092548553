    <p>LON­DON • Pep Guardi­ola re­vealed he has ev­ery­thing he needs to im­prove his Manch­ester City side af­ter sign­ing a two-year con­tract ex­ten­sion yesterday.</p>
    <p>The Spa­niard, 49, had seven months left on his pre­vi­ous deal and it had been sug­gested he might leave City. Up­heaval at his old club Barcelona saw him linked with a re­turn to the Nou Camp, but he has agreed to stay at City un­til 2023.</p>
    <p>Guardi­ola, also a for­mer coach at</p>
    <p>Bay­ern Mu­nich, is mid­way through his fifth cam­paign at the Eti­had and his new deal will ex­tend what is al­ready his long­est stay at any club.</p>
    <p>“Ever since I ar­rived at Manch­ester City I have been made to feel so wel­come in the club and in the city it­self,” Guardi­ola said. “Since then we have achieved a great deal to­gether, scored goals, won games and tro­phies, and we are all very proud of that suc­cess.</p>
    <p>“Hav­ing that kind of sup­port is the best thing any man­ager can have. I have ev­ery­thing I could pos­si­bly want to do my job well...</p>
    <p>“The chal­lenge for us is to con­tinue im­prov­ing and evolv­ing and I am very ex­cited about help­ing Manch­ester City do that.”</p>
    <p>City have won 181 of 245 games un­der Guardi­ola – a 73.9 per cent win rate. He has de­liv­ered two Pre­mier League ti­tles, three League Cups and one FA Cup, set­ting sev­eral scor­ing and points records. But win­ning the club’s first Cham­pi­ons League re­mains the ob­jec­tive. Guardi­ola won Europe’s elite club com­pe­ti­tion twice with Barcelona but failed to reach a fi­nal in three years at Bay­ern.</p>
    <p>His new deal will also heighten spec­u­la­tion of Guardi­ola re­unit­ing with Barcelona’s Lionel Messi. The for­ward will have just six months left on his con­tract in the New Year and is free to ne­go­ti­ate a free trans­fer with for­eign clubs. But City, ham­pered by in­juries to strikers Ser­gio Aguero and Gabriel Je­sus this season, are re­port­edly eye­ing a</p>
    <p>Jan­uary swoop for the 33-year-old.</p>
    <p>City, who travel to Tot­ten­ham for to­mor­row’s Pre­mier League clash, are in 10th place, six points be­hind lead­ers Le­ices­ter with a game in hand.</p>
    <p>City chair­man Khal­doon Mubarak high­lighted that Guardi­ola’s ex­ten­sion is a sign the club are head­ing in the right di­rec­tion.</p>
    <p>“It is a prod­uct of the mu­tual trust and re­spect that ex­ists be­tween him and the en­tire club,” he said. “Im­por­tantly, it is a val­i­da­tion of the football struc­ture and phi­los­o­phy that has been built over more than a decade and to which he has con­trib­uted so much.”</p>
