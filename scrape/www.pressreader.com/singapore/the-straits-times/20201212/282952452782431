    <p>In the pop­u­lar Ja­panese stree­trac­ing anime Ini­tial D, a young street racer makes speedy de­liv­er­ies of tofu in his fa­ther’s Toy­ota Sprinter Trueno coupe.</p>
    <p>The car and its liv­ery are one of the most iconic pair­ings in lat­ter­day pop cul­ture.</p>
    <p>So, it is strange to see the fa­mous Ja­panese words (trans­lated as “Fu­ji­wara Tofu Shop”) em­bla­zoned on the side of a very Ger­man BMW 3-se­ries. But for its 48-year-old owner Re­mund Koh, the $6,000 paint job – done by hand – was money well spent.</p>
    <p>The job, done by a known paint re­storer of old cars in Sin Ming, took more than two months to com­plete.</p>
    <p>Mr Koh, a teacher, be­came a big fan of Ini­tial D af­ter watch­ing the 2005 Hong Kong movie adap­ta­tion, which starred Tai­wanese pop star Jay Chou.</p>
    <p>He is happy with the unique paint job. In­deed, on close in­spec­tion, the paint­work is glossy and blem­ish­free, with the Ja­panese text bold and crisp be­neath the clear coat.</p>
    <p>As to why he put the art­work on a Ger­man coupe, Mr Koh says he wanted “some­thing crazy that would turn heads”.</p>
    <p>The car it­self is an in­ter­est­ing spec­i­men – a 1992 318is coupe pow­ered by a 1.9-litre four­cylin­der en­gine mated to a fivespeed man­ual gear­box.</p>
    <p>Com­pared with the more com­mon 318i of the era, the 318is’ en­gine has twin cams and 16 valves (twice the num­ber in the 318i), mak­ing it more pow­er­ful.</p>
    <p>Mr Koh bought the used car in 2014 for around $27,000 af­ter much search­ing. He spent nearly $30,000 to re­fur­bish it, much to his wife’s cha­grin.</p>
    <p>“I was crazy about this car when it came out,” he says. But he could not af­ford it as he was an un­der­grad­u­ate back then.</p>
    <p>For the restora­tion, he had to source parts from Ger­many as many were no longer avail­able in Sin­ga­pore, and right-hand-drive parts from other coun­tries.</p>
    <p>He had the car re­sprayed from Es­to­ril Blue to its cur­rent colours, re­uphol­stered the in­te­rior, swopped the brakes for an AP Rac­ing big-brakes kit and changed the in-car en­ter­tain­ment sys­tem.</p>
    <p>Re­luc­tant to part with his pre­cious ride, he re­newed its cer­tifi­cate of en­ti­tle­ment in April last year – its fourth – for an­other decade.</p>
    <p>“I will prob­a­bly keep the car for my two daugh­ters,” he muses, re­fer­ring to his 12-year-old twins.</p>
    <p>But he also ad­mits he is taken by the new BMW 4-se­ries coupe and hints that he might trade up if he can find an equally “ded­i­cated” buyer for his Teu­tonic “tofu car­rier”.</p>
    <p>Apart from work­ing on his car, Mr Koh also col­lects and trades rare Lego sets, which can cost up to thou­sands of dol­lars each.</p>
    <p>But those do not get half the at­ten­tion his car does.</p>
    <p>“I have had stares, waves and thumbs-ups from pedes­tri­ans and fel­low car lovers. More im­por­tantly, I just en­joy driv­ing this car.”</p>
