    <p>OR­LANDO • Home-court ad­van­tage has been wiped out dur­ing this sea­son’s Na­tional Bas­ket­ball As­so­ci­a­tion (NBA) play-offs, but for one team, there may yet be home com­forts.</p>
    <p>Play­ing j ust 40km away from their Amway Cen­tre, the Or­lando Magic stunned the top-seeded Mil­wau­kee Bucks 122-110 on Tues­day in Game 1 of the East­ern Con­fer­ence first round.</p>
    <p>Nikola Vuce­vic scored a play-off ca­reer-high 35 points to pro­pel the eighth seeds, who en­tered the best-of-seven se­ries at the Walt Dis­ney World Re­sort in Florida as heavy un­der­dogs.</p>
    <p>“My mind­set was to be ag­gres­sive,” said the cen­tre, an All-Star last year. He added 14 re­bounds and four as­sists. “When I’m ag­gres­sive, whether it is shoot­ing the ball or try­ing to make plays, a lot of good things hap­pen for our team.”</p>
    <p>Or­lando got off to a fast start, tak­ing an 18-point lead in the first half be­fore hold­ing off the Bucks’ runs.</p>
    <p>The Bucks got within six at 99-93 on a spin­ning Brook Lopez fin­ish with 8min 13sec to play. But Or­lando an­swered with Ter­rence Ross’ driv­ing dunk and D.J. Au­gustin’s three-pointer pushed their ad­van­tage back to dou­ble dig­its.</p>
    <p>The Magic shot 49.4 per cent and made 16 three-point­ers against a Mil­wau­kee de­fence that was rated the NBA’s best dur­ing the reg­u­lar sea­son.</p>
    <p>Or­lando hit those marks de­spite se­cond-lead­ing scorer Evan Fournier held score­less un­til he sank three shots from be­yond the arc in the fourth quar­ter.</p>
    <p>The vic­tory was even more shock­ing given that the Magic were with­out start­ing for­ward Aaron Gor­don, who was out with a ham­string in­jury.</p>
    <p>They were also miss­ing Jonathan Isaac, Al-Farouq Aminu, and Michael Carter-Wil­liams.</p>
    <p>With­out Gor­don and Isaac, the 1.98m for­ward Gary Clark was the pri­mary de­fender on 2.21m Gian­nis An­te­tok­oun­mpo, who fin­ished with 31 points, 17 re­bounds and seven as­sists. But the front run­ner to re­peat as the NBA’s Most Valu­able Player did not make a field goal in the last 11 min­utes. Clark to­talled 15 points and six re­bounds.</p>
    <p>“Play harder,” An­te­tok­oun­mpo told ESPN when asked about his plans for Game 2 to­day. “Be more vo­cal. Lead by ex­am­ple... what I do... is that I get on the court and do what­ever it takes to win.”</p>
    <p>The Bucks, who have “home­court ad­van­tage” through­out their post-sea­son for fin­ish­ing top of the league (56-17), have not found their feet in the bub­ble. They were 3-5 in the seed­ing games since the league restarted last month and vet­eran guard Ge­orge Hill said they will have to do some “soul search­ing”.</p>
    <p>Or­lando’s Ross fin­ished with 18 points and six re­bounds, while Au­gustin added 11 points and 11 as­sists. But the Magic are mind­ful that they have ac­com­plished noth­ing yet.</p>
    <p>“We came out with a huge vic­tory,” Vuce­vic said. “Again, it’s just one game. We’ve got to move on.”</p>
