    <p>New Delhi’s com­fort level with the Repub­li­cans ap­pears to be high, but Mr Bi­den has been a long-time ad­vo­cate of closer ties with In­dia.</p>
    <p>South-east Asia has had a wild ride in Pres­i­dent Donald Trump’s first term. On his very first day in of­fice, Mr Trump pulled the United States out of the Trans-Pa­cific Part­ner­ship (TPP), a free trade agree­ment that would have been the largest in the world had it ma­te­ri­alised.</p>
    <p>The trade-de­pen­dent economies were rocked again when he launched a trade war with China, the largest trad­ing part­ner for most re­gional economies.</p>
    <p>But he stood with re­gional lead­ers at the 2017 US-Asean sum­mit in Manila – only to be a no-show for the next two years, and has not at­tended a sin­gle East Asia Sum­mit.</p>
    <p>The rip­ples from his free and open Indo-Pa­cific pol­icy, with a strik­ingly ad­ver­sar­ial po­si­tion on China, have cre­ated a new chop­pi­ness in the South China Sea, the site where the two su­per­pow­ers come in di­rect and fre­quent con­tact.</p>
    <p>As his four-year term comes to an end, Mr Trump has a vi­able chal­lenger in Demo­cratic can­di­date Joe Bi­den, who leads in opin­ion polls.</p>
    <p>The vice-pres­i­dent to then Pres­i­dent Barack Obama has promised to rene­go­ti­ate the TPP and favours strength­en­ing al­liances Mr Trump found bur­den­some.</p>
    <p>“Trump is renowned for his un­pre­dictabil­ity, his of­fi­cials are a mix of ide­o­logues and hard­lin­ers – that’s not par­tic­u­larly en­cour­ag­ing to­wards cool­ing ten­sions with China,” says Pro­fes­sor Joseph Liow, dean of the Col­lege of Hu­man­i­ties, Arts and So­cial Sci­ences at the Nanyang Tech­no­log­i­cal Univer­sity.</p>
    <p>“The re­gion is fa­mil­iar with Bi­den be­cause of the Obama years. He is likely to re­turn US for­eign pol­i­cy­mak­ing to a more fa­mil­iar ap­proach. But the beat­ing of the drums on China is go­ing to con­tinue. The world has changed sub­stan­tively since the Obama ad­min­is­tra­tion,” he adds.</p>
    <p>Mr Bi­den’s more tra­di­tional al­liance and mul­ti­lat­eral in­sti­tu­tional ap­proach is a draw for many.</p>
    <p>Says Dr Charles Mor­ri­son, an ex­pert on South-east Asian is­sues at the Honolulu-based East-West Cen­tre: “Bi­den would re­turn to the Paris cli­mate ac­cords, he would like to strengthen the World Health Or­gan­i­sa­tion, and he prom­ises to work mul­ti­lat­er­ally with al­lies and friends to coun­ter­act chal­lenges to the rule of law and main­tain a strong US global and re­gional lead­er­ship role.” So who would the re­gion pre­fer? “Some coun­tries might feel the Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion has paid at­ten­tion to crit­i­cal is­sues where Obama and his pre­de­ces­sors were re­luc­tant to take a strong po­si­tion – the rule of law in the South China Sea, for ex­am­ple,” says Prof Liow. “Still, there is no one can­di­date the en­tire re­gion will say ‘yay’ for.”</p>
    <p>On Sin­ga­pore, Prof Liow notes it has al­ways been able to work with both Demo­cratic and Repub­li­can ad­min­is­tra­tions. “Trump’s has not been the con­ven­tional Repub­li­can ad­min­is­tra­tion. But Sin­ga­pore has been able to sus­tain en­gage­ment with his of­fi­cials, es­pe­cially de­fence co­op­er­a­tion, which has been out­stand­ing,” he says.</p>
    <p>Last Septem­ber, Prime Min­is­ter Lee Hsien Loong and Mr Trump re­newed a key de­fence pact that al­lows Amer­i­can forces to use Sin­ga­pore’s air and naval bases, ex­tend­ing it by an­other 15 years to 2035.</p>
    <p>The post for US am­bas­sador in Sin­ga­pore, how­ever, was never filled.</p>
    <p>MALAYSIA WARY OF A CHANGE</p>
    <p>A Demo­cratic White House may mean greater scru­tiny on democ­racy, hu­man rights, labour stan­dards and the en­vi­ron­ment, which have been ar­eas where Malaysia’s re­la­tion­ship has been thorny, es­pe­cially dur­ing the Barisan Na­sional (BN) era.</p>
    <p>The Muhyid­din Yassin ad­min­is­tra­tion, which in­cludes many par­ties and in­di­vid­u­als in govern­ment dur­ing BN’s six-decade rule up to 2018, may find a Bi­den pres­i­dency see­ing a re­turn to such times.</p>
    <p>Al­ready, un­der Mr Trump, the US has black­listed sev­eral Malaysian glove­mak­ers – who have en­joyed high de­mand for their prod­ucts dur­ing the coro­n­avirus pan­demic – and even sterner scru­tiny could en­sue with Mr Bi­den in charge.</p>
    <p>“It’s not go­ing to be an eas­ier ride for sure,” po­lit­i­cal con­sul­tancy KRA Group’s strat­egy chief Amir Fa­reed Rahim tells The Sun­day Times.</p>
    <p>The Trump-led trade war with China cre­ated op­por­tu­ni­ties here thanks to di­ver­sions, es­pe­cially in tech­nol­ogy and man­u­fac­tur­ing sec­tors. For­eign di­rect in­vest­ment in Malaysia surged to more than RM80 bil­lion (S$26 bil­lion) an­nu­ally in the past two years, com­pared with RM55 bil­lion in 2017.</p>
    <p>But the Covid-19 blow to trad­ing na­tions like Malaysia will mean that more lib­eral at­ti­tudes to the move­ment of goods, and per­haps peo­ple, will be wel­comed. The first half of the year saw to­tal trade shrink by 7 per cent.</p>
    <p>The Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion’s re­cent re­jec­tion of China’s claim to nearly the en­tire South China Sea may tally with Malaysia’s po­si­tion.</p>
    <p>But Kuala Lumpur has been re­luc­tant to ride on US coat-tails in pur­su­ing its own stake in the sea, pre­fer­ring to un­der­take the painstak­ing process via in­ter­na­tion­ally recog­nised plat­forms such as the United Na­tions.</p>
    <p>ECHOES OF OBAMA IN BI­DEN EN­TICE IN­DONE­SIA</p>
    <p>Pro­fes­sor of in­ter­na­tional re­la­tions Banyu Per­wita, from Pres­i­dent Univer­sity in Bekasi, West Java prov­ince, says Mr Bi­den’s vic­tory would be pos­i­tive for In­done­sia, point­ing out that the US was closer to In­done­sia in the Obama years.</p>
    <p>“The key word is Indo-Pa­cific. Bi­den would take the new re­gional Indo-Pa­cific ini­tia­tive more se­ri­ously, and this would es­pe­cially ben­e­fit Asia, hence In­done­sia,” says Prof Banyu, the co-au­thor of a book on Mr Trump’s for­eign poli­cies.</p>
    <p>In­done­sian ty­coon Sof­jan Wanandi says the coun­try has not been di­rectly af­fected by Mr Trump’s ag­gres­sive Amer­ica-first pol­icy, since its ex­ports are com­ple­men­tary to the US. It is also seen by the US as a mid­dle power in the re­gion.</p>
    <p>“But the con­fronta­tions that Trump is cre­at­ing against China, Europe, Ja­pan, is cre­at­ing an in­di­rect im­pact,” he says. “China is In­done­sia’s largest trad­ing part­ner, while the US is third. If the in­sta­bil­ity con­tin­ues, China would be buy­ing fewer goods from In­done­sia.”</p>
    <p>BI­DEN MAY BE MORE CRIT­I­CAL OF PRAYUT GOVT</p>
    <p>A Trump vic­tory would be favourable to the cur­rent Thai govern­ment un­der Prime Min­is­ter Prayut Chan-o-cha, says Dr Thiti­nan Pong­sud­hi­rak, a po­lit­i­cal sci­en­tist from Chu­la­longkorn Univer­sity.</p>
    <p>Thai-US re­la­tions have warmed con­sid­er­ably un­der the Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion, whereas Mr Obama took a hard line against the 2014 mil­i­tary coup led by army chief Prayut, he says.</p>
    <p>He ex­pects a Bi­den ad­min­is­tra­tion to be a “re­cast” of Mr Obama’s.</p>
    <p>“If we have a con­tin­u­a­tion of this mil­i­tary-backed au­thor­i­tar­ian govern­ment un­der Gen­eral Prayut, a Trump win would be more favourable to a Prayut-led Thai­land,” he says. “A Bi­den (ad­min­is­tra­tion) would be more crit­i­cal of a Prayut kind of govern­ment.”</p>
    <p>VIET­NAM LEANS TO­WARDS TRUMP</p>
    <p>While Viet­nam’s ties with the US have flour­ished un­der both Repub­li­can and Demo­crat ad­min­is­tra­tions, Hanoi may qui­etly lean to­wards Mr Trump, says Dr Le Hong Hiep, a fel­low at ISEAS – Yu­sof Ishak In­sti­tute.</p>
    <p>“There may be some pref­er­ence for Trump to stay on,” he says. USViet­nam ties have pro­gressed un­der Mr Trump de­spite his tough talk on trade.</p>
    <p>Last year, for ex­am­ple, the US Com­merce Depart­ment slapped im­port du­ties of more than 400 per cent on Viet­namese steel.</p>
    <p>“Over­all, Viet­nam has been rather com­fort­able deal­ing with Trump. He has been tough on China, while he has been soft on is­sues like hu­man rights and val­ues.”</p>
    <p>Dr Hiep adds: “What mat­ters more to Viet­nam is how the US will deal with China and the South China Sea is­sue. On the two core is­sues, both pres­i­dents will not be so dif­fer­ent. The main dif­fer­ence would be their ap­proach to the rights is­sues.”</p>
    <p>BI­DEN SEEN AS A</p>
    <p>BET­TER BET FOR MANILA</p>
    <p>Mr Bi­den will be bet­ter for the Philip­pines, as he is likely to re­build the US’ rep­u­ta­tion among its key al­lies in the re­gion that has been eroded by Mr Trump’s trans­ac­tional ap­proach to diplo­macy, says Mr Dindo Man­hit, man­ag­ing di­rec­tor of the think-tank Strat­base Group.</p>
    <p>“Bi­den is very vo­cal about be­liev­ing in al­liances. I think Asia would like that type of lead­er­ship,” said Mr Man­hit.</p>
    <p>Pres­i­dent Ro­drigo Duterte may cast a wary eye on Mr Bi­den be­cause of the Democrats’ crit­i­cism of his hu­man rights record.</p>
    <p>“But (Duterte) will be down to serv­ing just a year and a half, while Bi­den, if he be­comes pres­i­dent, will serve for four years,” said Mr Man­hit. He ex­pects Mr Duterte’s suc­ces­sor to re­verse, or at least re­con­sider, the Philip­pines’ re­cent pivot to­wards China, es­pe­cially with the South China Sea re­main­ing a thorny is­sue be­tween Manila and Bei­jing.</p>
    <p>IN­DIA EX­PECTS NO DRA­MATIC CHANGE</p>
    <p>In­dian Prime Min­is­ter Naren­dra Modi and Mr Trump, both na­tion­al­ist lead­ers, share a strong rap­port.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump’s tough rhetoric against Pak­istan and China has found much sup­port in In­dia.</p>
    <p>The Trump cam­paign re­cently re­leased an elec­tion video fea­tur­ing Mr Modi, who has sup­port­ers among In­dian-Amer­i­can vot­ers.</p>
    <p>New Delhi’s com­fort level with the Repub­li­cans ap­pears to be high, but Mr Bi­den has been a long-time ad­vo­cate of closer ties with In­dia.</p>
    <p>Still in New Delhi, there is some trep­i­da­tion over whether there will be closer scru­tiny on In­dia’s do­mes­tic is­sues un­der Mr Bi­den.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump has paid scant at­ten­tion to con­tro­ver­sial el­e­ments of Mr Modi’s do­mes­tic agenda, like the re­moval of spe­cial sta­tus for Kash­mir or the Cit­i­zen­ship Amend­ment Act (CAA), which gives fast­tracked cit­i­zen­ship to non-Mus­lim mi­nori­ties from three neigh­bour­ing coun­tries.</p>
    <p>Mr Bi­den, on the other hand, men­tions on his web­site that he is dis­ap­pointed by the CAA and seeks restora­tion of rights for Kash­miris.</p>
