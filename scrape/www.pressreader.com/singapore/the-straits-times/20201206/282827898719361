    <p>Where: 01-132, Block 34 Up­per Cross Street Open: 8am to 8pm</p>
    <p>Un­like many other econ­omy rice stalls, which rely on ready-cut veg­eta­bles such as cab­bage, broc­coli, cau­li­flower and brin­jal, Cheong Lok Mixed Vegetable Rice cuts and slices its greens in-house. The re­sult is veg­eta­bles that look and taste fresher.</p>
    <p>One of nine out­lets, this one in Chi­na­town sea­sons its dishes with a lighter hand to cater to reg­u­lars – mostly se­niors liv­ing in the Chin Swee neigh­bour­hood.</p>
    <p>The knife skills of the chefs are ev­i­dent in the evenly cut ob­longs of brin­jal, which re­main a bright pur­ple af­ter cook­ing.</p>
    <p>Stir-fried brin­jal ($0.70 a serv­ing; $2 for sep­a­rate serv­ing) – a ba­sic com­bi­na­tion of gar­lic, dark soya sauce and oys­ter sauce – is tasty.</p>
    <p>The star here is steamed dory with ginger ($2 to $2.50 a piece; min­i­mum or­der of $2.50 a piece for sep­a­rate serv­ing). Finely juli­enned ginger is fried into golden crispy strands that are of restau­rant stan­dard, and fried gar­lic bits add flavour.</p>
    <p>The fish meat is firm and the light soya sauce sea­son­ing is well-bal­anced.</p>
    <p>Prawn paste chicken ($1.20 a serv­ing; $3 for sep­a­rate serv­ing) is well-mar­i­nated and crispy as it should be, although the old-fash­ioned red­dish hue of food colour­ing is off-putting.</p>
    <p>The prawn frit­ters ($2 for four pieces on the rice; $4 for eight pieces in sep­a­rate serv­ing) look bet­ter than they taste. The bat­ter is woe­fully un­der­salted and the bland prawns are sadly tiny com­pared with the puffed-up bat­ter.</p>
    <p>With an over-gen­er­ous gar­nish of toasted se­same seeds, the pork chop ($2 to $3, de­pend­ing on size, same price served sep­a­rately) also looks good, but is too sweet.</p>
    <p>The best times to go are at 11am and 5pm.</p>
