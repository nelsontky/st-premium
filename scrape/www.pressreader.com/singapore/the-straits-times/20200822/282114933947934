    <p>At a work meet­ing, you flex your in­dex fin­ger in a hor­i­zon­tal di­rec­tion to change a pre­sen­ta­tion slide to the next one on a screen me­tres away with­out us­ing a key­board or a re­mote clicker, and you ro­tate your wrist to go back to pre­vi­ous slides when needed.</p>
    <p>Back at home, you boot up your favourite video game and flex that same fin­ger to fire your in-game weapon, ro­tat­ing your wrist to move your char­ac­ter for­ward.</p>
    <p>Do­ing all these and more could one day be pos­si­ble with a smart glove devel­oped by a team of re­searchers from the National Uni­ver­sity of Sin­ga­pore (NUS).</p>
    <p>The wire­less glove has highly sen­si­tive mi­crofi­bre sen­sors wo­ven into the fab­ric, one for each fin­ger. Fin­ger and wrist ges­tures are mapped to var­i­ous func­tions tra­di­tion­ally done with a key­board or a gam­ing con­troller, such as the chang­ing of pre­sen­ta­tion slides and the fir­ing of weapons or mov­ing of char­ac­ters in video games.</p>
    <p>The sen­sors are about twice the thick­ness of a strand of hair and are filled with a con­duc­tive liq­uid metal that cre­ates a sig­nal when a small elec­tric cur­rent is run through the sen­sor.</p>
    <p>The sig­nal changes when the user bends a fin­ger and the sen­sor’s fi­bres, which is how the glove de­tects mo­tion.</p>
    <p>Be­cause of the light­weight and stretch­able mi­crofi­bre ma­te­rial the sen­sors are made of, the glove weighs just 40g, com­pared with a game con­troller, which weighs around 250g.</p>
    <p>The glove con­nects wire­lessly to a com­puter or gam­ing con­sole via Blue­tooth and has a bat­tery life of about eight hours, which the team is work­ing to im­prove on.</p>
    <p>The liq­uid metal in the sen­sors is not toxic and is made up of ma­te­ri­als that have been used in tooth fill­ings and vi­ta­min pills. The glove has also stood up to be­ing washed up to seven times in the wash­ing ma­chine dur­ing lab tests, ac­cord­ing to team leader Lim Ch­wee Teck.</p>
    <p>Pro­fes­sor Lim, who is di­rec­tor of the NUS In­sti­tute for Health In­no­va­tion and Tech­nol­ogy, said the sen­sor tech­nol­ogy was orig­i­nally devel­oped in 2017 for bio­med­i­cal pur­poses such as mea­sur­ing the pulse of a pa­tient or ban­dage pres­sure.</p>
    <p>“But com­mer­cial­is­ing bio­med­i­cal prod­ucts takes a long time and in­volves a lot of reg­u­la­tory ap­proval be­fore the prod­uct can ac­tu­ally be used,” said Prof Lim in a video con­fer­ence on Thurs­day.</p>
    <p>“Through some dis­cus­sions and brain­storm­ing ses­sions for other ap­pli­ca­tions, we found that we could weave (the mi­crofi­bre sen­sors) into a glove, and so we de­cided to ex­plore what could be done gam­ing-wise.”</p>
    <p>The NUS team has so far mapped ges­tures to 11 in­puts and com­mands for per­form­ing a va­ri­ety of in-game ac­tions usu­ally ac­com­plished by press­ing but­tons on reg­u­lar game con­trollers such as the fir­ing of weapons, and tested the glove on games such as first-per­son shooter ti­tle Bat­tle­field V.</p>
    <p>But many more ges­tures can still be added, and the glove could have the po­ten­tial even be­yond gam­ing as a gen­eral in­put de­vice to ac­com­plish ev­ery­day tasks cur­rently done with a mouse and a key­board.</p>
    <p>“So right now, for ex­am­ple, we have 10 fin­gers, each of which can ac­ti­vate one func­tion. But we can also have an­other (ges­ture) us­ing two fin­gers. So the per­mu­ta­tions are there,” said Prof Lim. “In fact, I wanted to ask the team to work on one (con­trol scheme) for me to op­er­ate my Pow­erPoint pre­sen­ta­tions, mov­ing from one slide to an­other.”</p>
    <p>Prof Lim said the goal is to go com­mer­cial with the glove in a year’s time through an NUS start-up called Mi­cro­tube Tech­nolo­gies that he founded with two team mem­bers, Dr Yeo Joo Chuan and Dr Yu Longteng. He es­ti­mated the glove could cost be­tween $200 and $300.</p>
    <p>“We are look­ing at de­vel­op­ing dif­fer­ent ver­sions for dif­fer­ent users, such as a sim­pler one for the mass mar­ket and a more ad­vanced one for se­ri­ous gamers,” Prof Lim said.</p>
    <p>“The gloves re­ally have to be cus­tomised for in­di­vid­ual use so we are also look­ing at dif­fer­ent sizes for chil­dren and adults.”</p>
