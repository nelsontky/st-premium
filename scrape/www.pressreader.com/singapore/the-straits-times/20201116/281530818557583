    <p>The world’s largest trade pact, the Re­gional Com­pre­hen­sive Eco­nomic Part­ner­ship, was inked by min­is­ters from 15 coun­tries in­clud­ing Sin­ga­pore. Prime Min­is­ter Lee Hsien Loong said it was a “ma­jor step for­ward for the world, at a time when mul­ti­lat­er­al­ism is los­ing ground, and global growth is slow­ing”.</p>
    <p>The world’s largest trade pact was inked yes­ter­day by min­is­ters from 15 coun­tries in­clud­ing Sin­ga­pore, in a move likely to spur the re­gion’s econ­omy as it bat­tles its worst cri­sis in decades.</p>
    <p>Build­ing on ex­ist­ing free trade deals among mem­bers, the Re­gional Com­pre­hen­sive Eco­nomic Part­ner­ship (RCEP) will broaden and deepen eco­nomic link­ages across the Asia-Pa­cific, ease trade in goods and ser­vices, fa­cil­i­tate the flow of for­eign in­vest­ments, and en­hance pro­tec­tions in ar­eas such as e-com­merce and in­tel­lec­tual prop­erty.</p>
    <p>RCEP mem­bers ac­count for 30 per cent of the world’s econ­omy and one-third of its pop­u­la­tion. They com­prise all 10 Asean mem­bers and key part­ners Aus­tralia, China, Ja­pan, South Korea and New Zealand.</p>
    <p>At a lead­ers’ sum­mit yes­ter­day, Prime Min­is­ter Lee Hsien Loong de­scribed the sign­ing of the pact as a “ma­jor step for­ward for the world, at a time when mul­ti­lat­er­al­ism is los­ing ground, and global growth is slow­ing”.</p>
    <p>“It sig­nals our col­lec­tive com­mit­ment to main­tain­ing open and con­nected sup­ply chains, and to pro­mot­ing freer trade and closer in­ter­de­pen­dence es­pe­cially in the face of Covid-19 when coun­tries are turn­ing in­wards and are un­der pro­tec­tion­ist pres­sures,” he said.</p>
    <p>The pact also gives its mem­bers larger stakes in one an­other’s suc­cess and pros­per­ity, while help­ing to strengthen re­gional peace and se­cu­rity, he added.</p>
    <p>PM Lee noted that the di­ver­sity of the par­tic­i­pat­ing RCEP coun­tries shows how economies at dif­fer­ent stages of de­vel­op­ment can come to­gether and con­trib­ute to one an­other’s de­vel­op­ment, as well as to the mul­ti­lat­eral trad­ing sys­tem.</p>
    <p>“This di­ver­sity, and the strong links that the par­tic­i­pat­ing coun­tries have with the US, Europe and the rest of the world, also re­flects the in­clu­sive­ness and open­ness of the agree­ment,” he added.</p>
    <p>PM Lee joined sev­eral lead­ers in ex­press­ing the hope that In­dia will be able to sign on in fu­ture, so that “par­tic­i­pa­tion in the RCEP will fully re­flect the emerg­ing pat­terns of in­te­gra­tion and re­gional co­op­er­a­tion in Asia”.</p>
    <p>New Delhi pulled out of talks last November after seven years of ne­go­ti­a­tions fol­low­ing con­cerns over trade im­bal­ances. Yes­ter­day, the RCEP lead­ers re­it­er­ated that the door re­mains open for In­dia.</p>
    <p>Some have raised con­cerns that China stands to ben­e­fit the most as the group’s largest econ­omy, but min­is­ters noted that the RCEP gives mem­bers’ busi­nesses greater ac­cess to the vast Chi­nese mar­ket.</p>
    <p>Chi­nese Pre­mier Li Ke­qiang said the sign­ing was a vic­tory for mul­ti­lat­er­al­ism and free trade, adding: “Let peo­ple choose unity and co­op­er­a­tion in the face of chal­lenges, rather than con­flict and con­fronta­tion.”</p>
    <p>The pact will en­ter into force once six Asean coun­tries and three part­ners have rat­i­fied it. RCEP lead­ers say they will ex­pe­dite their do­mes­tic pro­cesses to rat­ify the pact.</p>
    <p>It will elim­i­nate tar­iffs for at least 92 per cent of goods, with ad­di­tional pref­er­en­tial mar­ket ac­cess for ex­ports. The flow of goods will also be faster.</p>
    <p>More com­pa­nies will be able to pro­vide ser­vices in the re­gion, with for­eign share­hold­ing lim­its raised for at least 50 sub-sec­tors in­clud­ing pro­fes­sional ser­vices, telecom­mu­ni­ca­tions and fi­nan­cial ser­vices.</p>
    <p>Busi­nesses will also find it eas­ier to nav­i­gate and in­te­grate into re­gional value chains.</p>
    <p>Asean sec­re­tary-gen­eral Lim Jock Hoi told The Straits Times yes­ter­day that the RCEP will en­sure mar­kets are kept open, and pro­vide much needed cer­tainty and sta­bil­ity for busi­nesses as they cope with the Covid-19 cri­sis. “The sign­ing of the RCEP agree­ment at this time... is a demon­stra­tion of the re­gion’s strong com­mit­ment to open, in­clu­sive and rules-based mul­ti­lat­er­al­ism, and con­fi­dence of the con­tri­bu­tion of trade to post­pan­demic re­cov­ery ef­forts,” he said.</p>
    <p>Trade and In­dus­try Min­is­ter Chan Chun Sing, who signed the RCEP with fel­low trade min­is­ters, added about the pact: “Be­yond its eco­nomic value, it is also a state­ment of our strate­gic in­tent to have a shared in­ter­est in each other’s pros­per­ity and suc­cess. This bodes well for the se­cu­rity of the re­gion.”</p>
    <p>With all those head­winds to nav­i­gate, the RCEP still is a solid win for Asean. In terms of mar­ket ac­cess, it has won ad­di­tional ac­cess in trade in goods from the gi­ant economies of China, Ja­pan and South Korea – be­yond what Asean Plus One trade deals had of­fered thus far. The sim­pli­fi­ca­tion and con­sol­i­da­tion of rules gar­nered from mul­ti­far­i­ous FTAs that mark the RCEP is a gain for com­pa­nies, which can choose whether they want to claim mar­ket ac­cess un­der RCEP, or con­tinue us­ing stand­alone host-coun­try FTAs with part­ners as ex­ist.</p>
    <p>And so, Asean has got it done, fi­nally.</p>
    <p>By the stan­dards of the Com­pre­hen­sive and Pro­gres­sive Agree­ment for Trans-Pa­cific Part­ner­ship with which the RCEP will in­evitably be com­pared, the agree­ment inked yes­ter­day be­tween Asean and five of its key trad­ing part­ners – China, Ja­pan, South Korea, Aus­tralia and New Zealand – may look less am­bi­tious.</p>
    <p>Yet, given the com­plex­ity of the deal, the di­ver­sity and the dif­fer­ent stages of de­vel­op­ment that Re­gional Com­pre­hen­sive Eco­nomic Part­ner­ship (RCEP) economies are at, and its po­ten­tial, this is one huge achieve­ment. It makes a big state­ment at a time when mul­ti­lat­er­al­ism is un­der threat from trade wars and na­tion­al­is­tic pulls.</p>
    <p>In­deed, it could well turn out to be a turn­ing point for both East Asia’s, and South-east Asia’s, tricky re­la­tion­ship with China – one marked by both daz­zle­ment over the prospects of em­brac­ing and be­ing em­braced by the world’s No. 2 econ­omy, and ner­vous­ness about its im­pli­ca­tions.</p>
    <p>In North-east Asia, key economies like Ja­pan and South Korea have testy ties be­tween them­selves, and with China. Talks of a free trade agree­ment (FTA) link­ing them up have not made much ap­par­ent progress since the 16th round was held in Seoul a year ago. Now, the three – and Asean states – have to deal with one an­other from a sin­gle rule book writ­ten that en­com­passes a third of the global pop­u­la­tion and 30 per cent of world gross do­mes­tic prod­uct.</p>
    <p>“Some Asean coun­tries got a lit­tle ner­vous be­cause their di­a­logue part­ners’ economies are a lot big­ger than their own,” said Ms Deb­o­rah Elms, ex­ec­u­tive di­rec­tor of the Asian Trade Cen­tre in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>“It is not the most am­bi­tious trade deal ever signed, nor the worst. The cru­cial part is that once it is in place, com­pa­nies will start think­ing of Asia as a rea­son­able, fi­nal mar­ket for them. They will start get­ting struc­tured for RCEP.”</p>
    <p>What’s more, there are plans for an RCEP sec­re­tar­iat that will mon­i­tor the progress of the agree­ment and set­tle dis­putes. While no venue has been cho­sen for this body, the fact that such plans are on the anvil sug­gests that this could in time prove to be a mo­men­tous move. It would come against the back­ground of the trade fric­tions be­tween the United States and China, and con­tin­u­ing ques­tions about the World Trade Or­gan­i­sa­tion.</p>
    <p>Just hav­ing a plat­form for Asian economies to as­sem­ble with part­ners from Aus­tralia and New Zealand would in it­self be a sig­nif­i­cant de­vel­op­ment.</p>
    <p>The RCEP’s im­ple­men­ta­tion – it could take as much as a year while a min­i­mum of six of the 10 Asean states and three of five trad­ing part­ners rat­ify it be­fore it can be con­sid­ered live – will likely co­in­cide with an up­draught for re­gional economies as they emerge from Covid-19. That could set the stage for years of good growth. The surge, wisely used, should also pro­vide the el­bow room for Asean economies to swiftly im­prove their com­pet­i­tive­ness to meet the in­evitable man­u­fac­tur­ing chal­lenge from pow­er­house China.</p>
    <p>ENOR­MOUS DOC­U­MENT</p>
    <p>To get a sense of what was just achieved, look at the enor­mity of the RCEP doc­u­ment, pro­duced after 31 rounds of ne­go­ti­a­tions, 15 trade ne­go­ti­at­ing com­mit­tee meet­ings and 19 min­is­te­rial rounds over an eight-year pe­riod.</p>
    <p>More than a mere free trade deal, this truly is a “com­pre­hen­sive” agree­ment. It rests on a tri­pod of trade in goods, trade in ser­vices and elec­tronic com­merce and runs to more than 14,000 pages with 20 chap­ters, plus an­nexes and sched­ules. The sig­na­to­ries in­clude ad­vanced economies like Sin­ga­pore, Ja­pan and Aus­tralia, up­per mid­dle in­come economies such as Malaysia and Thai­land, and less de­vel­oped coun­tries such as Laos and Cam­bo­dia.</p>
    <p>Asean states first had to ne­go­ti­ate com­mon po­si­tions be­tween them­selves, then take those con­sen­sus po­si­tions to the di­a­logue part­ners, some of whom wanted am­bi­tious goal­posts set for in­tel­lec­tual prop­erty, e-com­merce and gov­ern­ment pro­cure­ment rules. The last would have been par­tic­u­larly tricky, es­pe­cially for na­tions that run coali­tion gov­ern­ments, be­cause min­is­te­rial port­fo­lios are of­ten sought and al­lot­ted based on the abil­ity to hand con­tracts to key sup­port­ers.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing the lengthy ne­go­ti­a­tions, sev­eral par­tic­i­pat­ing states held elec­tions and some saw gov­ern­ment changes, with new lead­ers of­ten stress­ing dif­fer­ent pri­or­i­ties.</p>
    <p>Last November, just when ev­ery­one thought a deal was in sight, In­dia an­nounced a stun­ning pull­out. In part that was be­cause of fear of be­ing over­run by cheaper fac­tory goods from China and farm pro­duce from Aus­tralia and New Zealand but it was also be­cause its de­mands on open­ing ser­vices trade, where it en­joys a mea­sure of com­pet­i­tive­ness, were not met to its sat­is­fac­tion.</p>
    <p>Shortly after that set­back, Covid-19 be­gan to blow through the world, dis­rupt­ing economies and sup­ply chains.</p>
    <p>With all those head­winds to nav­i­gate, the RCEP still is a solid win for Asean. In terms of mar­ket ac­cess, it has won ad­di­tional ac­cess</p>
    <p>in trade in goods from the gi­ant economies of China, Ja­pan and South Korea – be­yond what Asean Plus One trade deals had of­fered thus far. The sim­pli­fi­ca­tion and con­sol­i­da­tion of rules gar­nered from mul­ti­far­i­ous FTAs that mark the RCEP is a gain for com­pa­nies, which can choose whether they want to claim mar­ket ac­cess un­der RCEP, or con­tinue us­ing stand­alone host-coun­try FTAs with part­ners as ex­ist.</p>
    <p>COM­PRO­MISES</p>
    <p>Need­less to say, the urge to some­how pa­per over con­flict­ing pulls has in­volved com­pro­mises. Where FTAs be­tween some key economies do not ex­ist, as be­tween China and Ja­pan, those economies seem to have been will­ing to give Asean more ben­e­fits than to each other – and South-east Asia is not com­plain­ing.</p>
    <p>Like­wise, ne­go­tia­tors on the e-com­merce track have re­port­edly pro­duced only what in diplo­matic speak is called a “bal­anced out­come”, mean­ing they wish they could have done bet­ter. While there is as­sur­ance that per­sonal data will be pro­tected when shop­ping on­line, there are ques­tions over the va­lid­ity and ac­cep­tance of elec­tronic sig­na­tures in some coun­tries.</p>
    <p>This is a pity. Ac­cord­ing to a re­port last week from Google, Te­masek and Bain & Co, South-east Asia’s In­ter­net sec­tors could reach US$100 bil­lion (S$135 bil­lion) in gross mer­chan­dise value (GMV) this year, with e-com­merce reg­is­ter­ing 63 per cent growth while the on­line travel seg­ment con­tracted al­most as much. Over­all, the re­gion’s In­ter­net sec­tors re­main on track to cross US$300 bil­lion in GMV by 2025.</p>
    <p>Still, there now is a chap­ter in the RCEP ex­clu­sively on e-com­merce. That pro­vides a land­ing zone for fu­ture ne­go­ti­a­tions on the sub­ject as when the RCEP comes up for re­view in five years’ time.</p>
    <p>Like­wise, in clas­sic Asean style, ne­go­tia­tors seem to have sidesteppe­d some sen­si­tive is­sues by park­ing them in the “work agenda” – short for shelved for fu­ture dis­cus­sions. One such topic was the is­sue of in­vest­ments and dis­putes set­tle­ment, which helped clinch the in­vest­ment chap­ter. The fear was that ag­grieved com­pa­nies may have been able to take gov­ern­ments to court far too eas­ily. Still, RCEP coun­tries are now com­mit­ted to en­hanced in­vest­ment rules and dis­ci­plines.</p>
    <p>In­dia’s last-mile de­ci­sion to drop out also was a crush­ing dis­ap­point­ment, es­pe­cially to Sin­ga­pore, which had as­sid­u­ously worked to keep Asia’s third largest econ­omy within the RCEP. It did so de­spite de­mands from New Delhi that would have ren­dered the agree­ment al­most mean­ing­less, in­clud­ing ad­di­tional rules of ori­gin for thou­sands of prod­uct lines. Still, the 15 sig­na­to­ries, China in­cluded, have told New Delhi that the door re­mains open for it to re­join RCEP.</p>
    <p>For trade-driven Sin­ga­pore, the very act of 15 economies join­ing to push trade is in it­self a huge vic­tory, even if the ben­e­fits to it may not be im­me­di­ately vis­i­ble given that the Repub­lic has its own qual­ity deals with so many na­tions. Sin­ga­pore­ans who cast a wary eye on ser­vices agree­ments out of fear they will lead to an in­flux of for­eign tal­ent can rest as­sured that noth­ing in the RCEP al­lows that to hap­pen. On the other hand, it opens up op­por­tu­ni­ties for a host of Sin­ga­porean ser­vices com­pa­nies to move into East Asia. Some two-thirds of ser­vice sec­tors will be fully open with in­creased for­eign share­hold­ing lim­its, in­clud­ing in pro­fes­sional ser­vices, telecom­mu­ni­ca­tions, fi­nan­cial ser­vices and lo­gis­tics.</p>
    <p>Much of the RCEP’s fu­ture will de­pend on how the 14 smaller economies ad­just to China be­ing front and cen­tre in the group­ing. Thus far, it ap­pears to have taken a help­ful pos­ture in ne­go­ti­a­tions.</p>
    <p>If China can hold that line post-im­ple­men­ta­tion, the RCEP may undo much of the per­cep­tion dam­age caused by its as­sertive mil­i­tary and of­ten-flinty diplo­macy. Make no mis­take: This deal is as much about geostrat­egy as geoe­co­nomics.</p>
