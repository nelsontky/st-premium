    <p>Sin­ga­pore will re­main open to top in­ter­na­tional tal­ent as it seeks to main­tain its sta­tus as a pre­ferred eco­nomic hub amid changes brought about by Covid-19, Trade and In­dus­try Min­is­ter Chan Chun Sing said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>“We as­pire to be the crit­i­cal node in global busi­nesses’ value chains, pro­duc­tion chains and sup­ply chains, where we add value, serv­ing not just as a lo­ca­tion to trade through,” he said dur­ing a we­bi­nar hosted by Stan­dard Char­tered Bank ti­tled Sin­ga­pore – The Global Hub And Gate­way To Asean.</p>
    <p>One way is to “bring in in­ter­na­tional tal­ent in a cal­i­brated man­ner, as (the Repub­lic has) al­ways done”, he said in his key­note ad­dress.</p>
    <p>He ac­knowl­edged that com­pa­nies have been anx­ious about the re­cent scru­tiny over for­eign tal­ent, and as­sured firms that the Repub­lic’s tight­en­ing of its for­eign worker poli­cies is not “a sig­nal that we are turn­ing away top in­ter­na­tional tal­ent”.</p>
    <p>“Our for­eign worker pol­icy will shift in­creas­ingly to­wards qual­ity rather than quan­tity,” he added.</p>
    <p>“This scru­tiny is not unique to Sin­ga­pore. Ev­ery coun­try fac­ing eco­nomic slow­down and re­ces­sion will have el­e­ments ques­tion­ing the bal­ance be­tween lo­cals and for­eign­ers in the job market.</p>
    <p>“Let me be clear – we want the world’s best and bright­est to be with Team Sin­ga­pore, to aug­ment our skills and ca­pa­bil­i­ties, com­pet­ing on our side rather than against us, and ul­ti­mately, to ben­e­fit Sin­ga­pore­ans, not to sub­sti­tute or hurt them.”</p>
    <p>But “we are se­ri­ous about dis­crim­i­na­tory hir­ing prac­tices”, Mr Chan said, adding that busi­nesses, re­gard­less of size or na­tion­al­ity, must play their part in build­ing up the Sin­ga­porean work­force and giv­ing Sin­ga­pore­ans a fair shot at the same job op­por­tu­nity as a for­eigner.</p>
    <p>Keep­ing its ports – both sea and air – open to the world, investing in its dig­i­tal and phys­i­cal con­nec­tiv­ity and press­ing on harder with its ef­forts to trans­form its econ­omy are other ways by which Sin­ga­pore will re­tain its sta­tus as a global hub.</p>
    <p>The Repub­lic will con­tinue to in­vest in the build­ing of its fifth air­port ter­mi­nal, Tuas mega­port and re­gional de­vel­op­ments such as Sungei Kadut Eco-Dis­trict and Greater South­ern Wa­ter­front, Mr Chan said.</p>
    <p>An­other fo­cus is to build ca­pa­bil­i­ties “that are hard to re­place, to en­able Sin­ga­pore to adapt and be more com­pet­i­tive in a Covid-19 world” through in­dus­try trans­for­ma­tion maps and Skill­sFu­ture, Mr Chan said.</p>
    <p>Trans­for­ma­tion road maps have been de­vel­oped to en­cour­age tech­no­log­i­cal in­no­va­tion among firms un­der a $4.5 bil­lion pro­gramme, while Skill­sFu­ture is the na­tional move­ment to change how peo­ple view skills, jobs and learn­ing.</p>
    <p>The min­is­ter noted that Covid-19 has sped up com­pa­nies’ re­views of their or­gan­i­sa­tional process, and tech­nol­ogy has re­de­fined what it means to be a hub in the global econ­omy.</p>
    <p>Some com­pa­nies have cho­sen to re­spond by hav­ing a sin­gle global head­quar­ters, ac­com­pa­nied by sev­eral smaller spe­cialised nodes, while oth­ers have re­lo­cated their sup­ply chains closer to the prod­ucts’ de­mand mar­kets, he added.</p>
    <p>He said: “The dig­i­tal na­ture of work dur­ing Covid-19 has re­moved ge­o­graph­i­cal and phys­i­cal bound­aries, and made a stronger case for dig­i­tal­is­ing and ‘vir­tu­al­is­ing’ busi­ness mod­els...</p>
    <p>“We are likely to see fur­ther re­or­gan­i­sa­tion of the global sup­ply and value chains.”</p>
    <p>He added that in­vestors have so far cho­sen to in­vest in Sin­ga­pore be­cause it has a sta­ble gov­ern­ment, clear rule of law, and a rich and di­verse ecosys­tem of in­no­va­tion, tal­ent and dig­i­tal con­nec­tiv­ity.</p>
    <p>Th­ese char­ac­ter­is­tics help busi­nesses to suc­ceed, re­gard­less of where they are or their size, and the Repub­lic will con­tinue to build on such strengths amid Covid-19.</p>
    <p>“We do not take (our cur­rent hub sta­tus) for granted. We know com­pe­ti­tion is stiff. If we do not adapt to the chang­ing na­ture of how busi­nesses op­er­ate, we will eas­ily be by­passed,” said Mr Chan.</p>
