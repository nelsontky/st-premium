    <p>The Haunt­ing Of Bly Manor re­unites the creator and stars of Net­flix’s break­out hor­ror hit The Haunt­ing Of Hill House (2018 to present) – and they are adapt­ing yet an­other ac­claimed work of hor­ror fic­tion: the clas­sic 19th­cen­tury novella The Turn Of The Screw by Henry James.</p>
    <p>And, as with the first in­stal­ment of the an­thol­ogy se­ries cre­ated by Mike Flana­gan (Dr Sleep, 2019), this chap­ter will be less about ghosts than the grief and trauma they rep­re­sent, say ac­tors Henry Thomas and Vic­to­ria Pe­dretti.</p>
    <p>The pair chat­ted to the me­dia by video call from their homes i n Van­cou­ver and Los An­ge­les, re­spec­tively.</p>
    <p>Pe­dretti, 25, re­veals that this haunted-house tale, which is set in 1980s Eng­land, will also sneak in a sur­prise Gothic ro­mance that is quite dif­fer­ent from the usual Hol­ly­wood love story.</p>
    <p>She plays Dani, a young Amer­i­can hired by wealthy English­man Henry Win­grave (Thomas) to be a live-in nanny to his or­phaned niece and nephew (Amelie Bea Smith and Ben­jamin Evan Ainsworth) fol­low­ing the death of their gov­erness.</p>
    <p>All re­side at a grand old coun­try es­tate, Bly Manor, where the chil­dren, the staff and the prop­erty it­self all seem to be har­bour­ing dark and painful se­crets that are slowly re­vealed to Dani.</p>
    <p>Care­ful not to give away spoil­ers, Pe­dretti says The Haunt­ing Of Bly Manor is also “a love story on many lev­els”.</p>
    <p>“It’s great to see Dani ex­pe­ri­ence mul­ti­ple loves over the course of this sea­son,” says the ac­tress, who also ap­pears in psy­cho­log­i­cal drama se­ries You (2019 to present).</p>
    <p>Like The Haunt­ing Of Hill House – which was about a group of sib­lings whose ex­pe­ri­ences in a haunted home fol­low them into adult­hood – writer- pro­ducer Flana­gan brings an un­usu­ally ma­ture, nu­anced look at adult re­la­tion­ships.</p>
    <p>“They are very hon­est with each other and slowly gain trust with each other,” Pe­dretti says.</p>
    <p>“It’s in­cred­i­ble to not see two peo­ple throw them­selves into all of these false ex­pec­ta­tions of each other be­fore they even get to know each other.”</p>
    <p>Other than the haunted-house el­e­ment, there are other com­mon­al­i­ties be­tween this sea­son and the first.</p>
    <p>“There’s a pe­riod piece within the pe­riod piece,” re­veals Thomas, 49.</p>
    <p>“We go back in time, and fur­ther than we’ve ever gone be­fore. But it’s a dif­fer­ent world, and we’re ex­plor­ing the works of a dif­fer­ent au­thor from a dif­fer­ent time. So it makes things ex­cit­ing and new.”</p>
    <p>The ac­tor ad­mits he is scep­ti­cal when it comes to the su­per­nat­u­ral and in­stead sees the ghosts in these sto­ries as metaphor­i­cal.</p>
    <p>“The su­per­nat­u­ral rep­re­sents el­e­ments of shame and guilt and re­gret. Those are the ghosts that haunt Henry Win­grave day to day,” says the star of E.T. The Ex­traTer­res­trial (1982). “And I think they’ve be­come su­per­nat­u­ral in the sense that they’ve con­sumed him.”</p>
    <p>This psy­cho­log­i­cal con­nec­tion is even more ap­par­ent with Pe­dretti’s char­ac­ter.</p>
    <p>“For Dani, the ghost she sees at the be­gin­ning of the show was a re­flec­tion of how she sees her­self – that she needs to con­stantly be re­mem­ber­ing the way in which she let some­one she loved down, and that guilt and shame fol­lows her,” the ac­tress says.</p>
    <p>Thomas be­lieves this ap­proach to the scares is what made The Haunt­ing Of Hill House feel like a breath of fresh air for hor­ror fans.</p>
    <p>He says: “The in­ter­est­ing thing was that it was cen­tred around a fam­ily that lived in a haunted house, but is less about the haunted stuff. That was part of it, but you cared for the char­ac­ters deeply by the time you fig­ured out there was other stuff go­ing on.</p>
    <p>“So I think this more hu­man­is­tic ap­proach within the genre, fans re­spond to it. And as ac­tors and sto­ry­tellers, we can do a lot more than what we were al­lowed to do be­fore within cer­tain gen­res as a re­sult.”</p>
    <p>The Haunt­ing Of Bly Manor starts stream­ing on Net­flix to­mor­row.</p>
