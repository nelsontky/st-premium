    <p>TOKYO • Two decades af­ter Ja­pan rolled out an am­bi­tious plan to go dig­i­tal, the Covid-19 cri­sis has ex­posed the govern­ment’s deeply rooted tech­no­log­i­cal short­com­ings as min­istries re­main stuck in a pa­per-driven cul­ture that ex­perts say is hurt­ing pro­duc­tiv­ity.</p>
    <p>While Tokyo has made “dig­i­tal trans­for­ma­tion” its main pol­icy plank this year, the switch may not prove so easy, as bu­reau­crats from dif­fer­ent min­istries are still un­able to hold tele­con­fer­ences to­gether and lit­tle of their ad­min­is­tra­tive work can be done on­line.</p>
    <p>An­a­lysts say the lack of govern­ment dig­i­tal­i­sa­tion could re­duce the in­cen­tive for the pri­vate sec­tor to go dig­i­tal in a blow to Ja­pan’s ef­forts to boost pro­duc­tiv­ity.</p>
    <p>“Lack of dig­i­tal in­vest­ment by the govern­ment has ham­pered pro­duc­tiv­ity and ef­fi­ciency at the pri­vate sec­tor,” said se­nior econ­o­mist Takuya Hoshino at Dai­ichi Life Re­search In­sti­tute.</p>
    <p>In its mid-year pol­icy strat­egy, the govern­ment vowed to ac­cel­er­ate dig­i­tal­i­sa­tion of its out­dated ad­min­is­tra­tion, which has de­layed de­liv­ery of cash pay­outs to help ci­ti­zens weather the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Much of the prob­lem stems from Ja­pan’s pref­er­ence for pa­per doc­u­ments and seal for ap­proval at govern­ment of­fices.</p>
    <p>Mr Seiji Ki­hara, a former Min­istry of Finance of­fi­cial who now serves as rul­ing Lib­eral Demo­cratic Party’s deputy pol­icy chief, said young bu­reau­crats were run­ning around with a pile of doc­u­ments seek­ing bosses’ seal for ap­proval when he was there 20 years ago.</p>
    <p>“They are do­ing pretty much the same now.”</p>
    <p>Adding to its dig­i­tal woes is Ja­pan’s ver­ti­cally struc­tured bu­reau­cracy: each min­istry as well as lo­cal gov­ern­ments, for in­stance, have de­vel­oped their own com­puter sys­tems that are not com­pat­i­ble with each other.</p>
    <p>Cur­rently, each min­istry has de­vel­oped its own LAN net­work with var­i­ous ven­dors, mak­ing it dif­fi­cult to hold tele­con­fer­ence with each other be­cause of dif­fer­ences in their on-line se­cu­rity pol­icy, a Cabi­net Of­fice of­fi­cial in charge of IT strat­egy, who de­clined to be named, told Reuters.</p>
    <p>In Ja­pan, less than 12 per cent of ad­min­is­tra­tive work is trans­acted on­line, ac­cord­ing to Ja­pan Re­search In­sti­tute. Over­all, it could cost the govern­ment 323 mil­lion work­ing hours per year if it does not go dig­i­tal, trans­lat­ing into per­son­nel costs of nearly US$8 bil­lion (S$11 bil­lion), a govern­ment reg­u­la­tory re­form panel es­ti­mated in a re­port re­leased in July last year.</p>
    <p>The dig­i­tal draw­backs give the lie to Ja­pan’s image as one of the world’s lead­ing high-tech na­tions – in fact, the world’s third-big­gest econ­omy ranked 23rd among 63 coun­tries, lag­ging be­hind some Asian na­tions such as Sin­ga­pore, South Korea and China in a sur­vey by Swiss think-tank IMD on dig­i­tal com­pet­i­tive­ness.</p>
