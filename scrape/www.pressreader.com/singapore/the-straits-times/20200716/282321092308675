    <p>DUBLIN (Ohio) • The con­grat­u­la­tory hand­shake with Jack Nick­laus that fol­lows a win at the Me­mo­rial Tour­na­ment is a cov­eted prize in golf, and the 18-time Ma­jor cham­pion said on Tues­day he will not let the Covid-19 pan­demic get in the way of tra­di­tion.</p>
    <p>Sev­eral for­mer Me­mo­rial win­ners have said the con­grat­u­la­tory hand­shake with the host, whose record haul of 18 Ma­jor ti­tles is three more than sec­ond-placed Tiger Woods on the all-time list, is spe­cial and one they would never for­get.</p>
    <p>Nick­laus, speak­ing at Muir­field Vil­lage Golf Club in Dublin, Ohio, ahead of the event’s start to­day, said he will be in his fa­mil­iar spot be­hind the 18th green on Sun­day with his right hand ex­tended to the win­ner.</p>
    <p>“I’m go­ing to shake their hand. I’m go­ing to walk right out there and shake your hand,” said the 80-year-old, who won the Me­mo­rial twice among his 73 PGA Tour vic­to­ries. He de­signed the course and f ounded the tour­na­ment, which be­gan in 1976.</p>
    <p>“If they don’t want to shake my hand, that’s fine, I’ll give them a fist bump or an el­bow bump, but I’m not go­ing to give them Covid-19 – I wouldn’t put any­body in that po­si­tion.</p>
    <p>“I wouldn’t do that, and if I was in any dan­ger of do­ing that, I wouldn’t shake their hand.</p>
    <p>“And in­ci­den­tally, I like shak­ing their hand, too. I think that’s a great tra­di­tion, but it was as much fun for me as I hope it is for them.”</p>
    <p>As Nick­laus is part of the Tour per­son­nel on site, he was re­quired to take a Covid-19 test. The Me­mo­rial Tour­na­ment was orig­i­nally sup­posed to be the first event on the cir­cuit’s re­vamped sched­ule to have fans present, and de­spite get­ting state ap­proval last month to do so, the PGA Tour de­cided on Mon­day to scrap those plans for all events this sea­son.</p>
    <p>Nick­laus said he would have loved to have had fans present this week to watch a solid field head­lined by Woods, who is play­ing in his first com­pet­i­tive event since Fe­bru­ary, and the top five golfers in the world, but he un­der­stood the de­ci­sion.</p>
    <p>“The Tour prob­a­bly made the right de­ci­sion as it re­lates to the Me­mo­rial Tour­na­ment. Maybe we are a lit­tle too early for the gal­leries,” he said. “In the end, the play­ers – you know, you can’t have a dance with­out the danc­ing girls – and I can un­der­stand where some might be very hes­i­tant.</p>
    <p>“We’re prob­a­bly do­ing the right thing right now, and we’re go­ing to have a good tour­na­ment ei­ther way.”</p>
    <p>SAFETY FIRST</p>
    <p>I’m not go­ing to give them Covid-19 – I wouldn’t put any­body in that po­si­tion.</p>
    <p>’’</p>
