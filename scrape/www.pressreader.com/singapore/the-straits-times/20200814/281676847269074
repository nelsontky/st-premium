    <p>A gov­ern­ment pro­posal to re­open schools in In­dia has gen­er­ated op­po­si­tion from many quar­ters, in­clud­ing par­ents and school man­age­ments con­cerned that such a move could ex­pose chil­dren to coro­n­avirus in­fec­tions.</p>
    <p>Ed­u­ca­tional in­sti­tutes were shut in March and have been asked to re­main closed un­til Aug 31. Me­dia re­ports last week sug­gested that the fed­eral gov­ern­ment could al­low a grad­ual re­open­ing of schools be­gin­ning next month in the new “un­lock” guide­lines that are ex­pected at the end of this month.</p>
    <p>Safety mea­sures pro­posed in­clude a re­duced pres­ence of stu­dents and staff on cam­puses as well as shorter school hours.</p>
    <p>This comes at a time when Covid-19 cases in In­dia have surged past 2.4 mil­lion with un­prece­dented daily spikes. More than 47,000 have died, the fourth-highest tally in the world.</p>
    <p>Cer­tain coun­tries like Is­rael and the United States have seen a wor­ry­ing out­break of coro­n­avirus in­fec­tions among chil­dren fol­low­ing the re­open­ing of schools.</p>
    <p>Mr Ashok Agar­wal, the na­tional pres­i­dent of the All In­dia Par­ents As­so­ci­a­tion, told The Straits Times that this is not the right time to re­open schools con­sid­er­ing the on­go­ing in­crease in coro­n­avirus in­fec­tions and a lack of pub­lic dis­ci­pline in fol­low­ing di­rec­tives such as phys­i­cal dis­tanc­ing and wear­ing of masks. “This year should be de­clared a zero aca­demic year and all stu­dents pro­moted to their next grades,” he said.</p>
    <p>Re­sults of a survey re­leased on Tues­day by Lo­calCir­cles, a com­mu­nity-based so­cial me­dia plat­form, found that only 33 per cent of re­spon­dents sup­ported the idea of re­open­ing schools from next month.</p>
    <p>The con­clu­sion was drawn from over 25,000 re­sponses from par­ents and grand­par­ents across In­dia.</p>
    <p>Con­cerns listed in­clude the threat posed to chil­dren and to elders should a child in the fam­ily get in­fected, as well as their lack of con­fi­dence in the abil­ity of schools to en­force phys­i­cal dis­tanc­ing.</p>
    <p>Even school ad­min­is­tra­tors think the move to re­open schools will not draw sup­port. “I don’t think schools will re­open this year. Even if they do, par­ents and guardians will not send their wards to schools given that coro­n­avirus cases are still grow­ing and are yet to reach their peak,” said Mr San­jee­van Bose, prin­ci­pal of Di­vine Pub­lic School in Go­rakh­pur in Ut­tar Pradesh. “In such a sit­u­a­tion, no par­ent will want to risk their child’s life,” he told ST.</p>
    <p>How­ever, the ad­verse im­pact on chil­dren from poor and marginalis­ed fam­i­lies who have been un­able to study on­line wor­ries many ed­u­ca­tion ac­tivists. Nearly 90 per cent of In­dian house­holds do not have a com­puter, ac­cord­ing to the lat­est avail­able gov­ern­ment data, from July 2017 to June 2018.</p>
    <p>And while smart­phones have widened ac­cess to the In­ter­net, less than half of the coun­try’s pop­u­la­tion – 500 mil­lion – is es­ti­mated to have such a de­vice. Ac­cess to high-speed In­ter­net also re­mains patchy in many parts of the coun­try.</p>
    <p>“We ex­pect as many as 20 to 25 per cent of chil­dren to drop out of schools if they re­main closed any longer,” said Mr Am­bar­ish Rai, the na­tional con­vener of the Right to Ed­u­ca­tion Forum. This would lead to ris­ing in­ci­dents of child labour and traf­fick­ing, he added.</p>
    <p>Mr Rai sug­gested that in­stead of a sweep­ing fed­eral plan ask­ing schools to re­open, the lo­cal au­thor­i­ties, in­clud­ing vil­lage coun­cils, should be al­lowed to make that de­ci­sion after a thor­ough lo­cal as­sess­ment of the threat posed by Covid-19.</p>
    <p>The gov­ern­ment, he said, mean­while could fo­cus on en­hanc­ing off­line learn­ing ini­tia­tives to en­sure chil­dren do not drop out of schools.</p>

Amid wor&#xAD;ries over re&#xAD;open&#xAD;ing of schools, there are also con&#xAD;cerns among many ed&#xAD;u&#xAD;ca&#xAD;tion ac&#xAD;tivists about the ad&#xAD;verse im&#xAD;pact of school clo&#xAD;sures on chil&#xAD;dren from poor and marginalis&#xAD;ed fam&#xAD;i&#xAD;lies who have been un&#xAD;able to study on&#xAD;line.</p>
