    <p>Around 1,000 po­si­tions in 5G ex­per­tise will be created by the end of this year, of which a third will be new roles, with the rest to be filled by ex­ist­ing telecom­mu­ni­ca­tions pro­fes­sion­als who will be re­trained.</p>
    <p>The ini­tia­tive is from a part­ner­ship be­tween the In­fo­comm Me­dia De­vel­op­ment Au­thor­ity (IMDA) and mo­bile network op­er­a­tors, as the de­mand for such pro­fes­sion­als con­tin­ues to grow while Sin­ga­pore’s na­tion­wide 5G roll-out gains mo­men­tum.</p>
    <p>An­nounc­ing this at the Con­necTech Asia vir­tual event yesterday, Min­is­ter for Com­mu­ni­ca­tions and In­for­ma­tion S. Iswaran said: “Even as we build our hard­ware and soft­ware, ul­ti­mately, peo­ple are at the heart of our growth. Part of the first wave of 5G op­por­tu­ni­ties is in the cre­ation of jobs to sup­port the network in­fra­struc­ture.”</p>
    <p>Train­ing of the ex­ist­ing tele­coms pro­fes­sion­als will be­gin at the end of this year, with plans to train 5,000 5G pro­fes­sion­als over the next three years.</p>
    <p>To over­see the match­ing of ta­lent with op­por­tu­ni­ties, IMDA has set up 5G work­force trans­for­ma­tion com­mit­tees with each of the four mo­bile network op­er­a­tors through the TechSkills Ac­cel­er­a­tor pro­gramme.</p>
    <p>Th­ese com­mit­tees will iden­tify the ta­lent re­quire­ments of each telco across func­tions such as 5G net­work­ing, cy­ber se­cu­rity and so­lu­tion engi­neer­ing, said Mr Iswaran.</p>
    <p>IMDA will also be ap­point­ing a con­sor­tium, com­pris­ing the Na­tional Univer­sity of Sin­ga­pore and Sin­ga­pore Polytech­nic, as the 5G and Tele­coms Pro­gramme Man­ager, which will co­or­di­nate pro­grammes to de­velop skills across the coun­try’s 5G ecosys­tem.</p>
    <p>Mr Iswaran added: “We will con­tinue to work closely with the in­dus­try to equip our work­force with the right skills so that our work­ers can se­cure good jobs as de­mand grows in emerg­ing tech ar­eas like 5G.</p>
    <p>“A strong and skilled work­force, to­gether with our 5G in­fra­struc­ture and tri­als, is essen­tial to ex­pand Sin­ga­pore’s ca­pac­ity for in­no­va­tion.”</p>
    <p>Ad­vanced 5G tech­nolo­gies promise surf­ing speeds 20 times faster than what 4G net­works of­fer and the abil­ity to con­nect 1,000 times as many de­vices.</p>
    <p>They can also bet­ter sup­port mis­sion-crit­i­cal ap­pli­ca­tions, such as driver­less car nav­i­ga­tion and re­mote surgery re­quir­ing a con­stant con­nec­tion with­out lag.</p>
    <p>Mr Iswaran said: “Sin­ga­pore has com­mit­ted to in­vest sub­stan­tially in 5G, be­cause of the ex­cit­ing op­por­tu­ni­ties it will bring busi­nesses, work­ers and in­di­vid­u­als.</p>
    <p>“Its higher band­width, lower la­tency and dy­namic network ca­pa­bil­i­ties will un­lock novel ap­pli­ca­tions that were not pre­vi­ously pos­si­ble.”</p>
    <p>There are now six con­sor­tia test­ing 5G ap­pli­ca­tions across dif­fer­ent sec­tors, from smart es­tates to con­sumer gam­ing.</p>
    <p>The Re­pub­lic’s two full-fledged na­tion­wide 5G net­works will be ready by 2025, and will be built by Sing­tel and, sep­a­rately, a joint ven­ture be­tween StarHub and M1.</p>
