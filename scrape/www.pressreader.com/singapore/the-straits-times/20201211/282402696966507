    <p>IN­AUS­PI­CIOUS START</p>
    <p>Rossi made his de­but with Ju­ven­tus in 1973 but the early years of his ca­reer were com­pro­mised by in­jury, need­ing three knee surg­eries.</p>
    <p>He was farmed out to Como, where he made his Serie A de­but, and then loaned to Serie B side Vi­cenza for the 1976-77 sea­son, mov­ing from the wing to a cen­tral strik­ing po­si­tion.</p>
    <p>It proved a mo­men­tous switch as Rossi was Serie B’s top scorer that year, fir­ing Vi­cenza to pro­mo­tion, and he led the Serie A scor­ing charts the fol­low­ing sea­son, earn­ing a call-up to Enzo Bear­zot’s Italy squad for the 1978 World Cup in Ar­gentina.</p>
    <p>Rossi shone in the tour­na­ment, scor­ing three goals as the Ital­ians fin­ished fourth.</p>
    <p>TO­TONERO SCAN­DAL</p>
    <p>De­spite his World Cup hero­ics, Rossi again strug­gled with in­juries in the fol­low­ing sea­son and Vi­cenza were rel­e­gated.</p>
    <p>They were forced to loan their star player to Serie A side Peru­gia, where he be­came em­broiled in the “To­tonero” match-fix­ing scan­dal.</p>
    <p>He was banned for three years, later re­duced to two, but Rossi has al­ways protested his in­no­cence. The ban ruled Rossi out of the 1980 Euro, where hosts Italy fin­ished fourth, but Juve re­turned for their for­mer player, who came back in time for the tail-end of their 1981-82 Serie A ti­tle-win­ning cam­paign, earn­ing a spot in Italy’s 1982 World Cup squad.</p>
    <p>HEY­SEL TRAGEDY</p>
    <p>After his hero­ics at the 1982 World Cup, Rossi en­joyed his most pro­lific spell with Juve, where he formed a for­mi­da­ble part­ner­ship with Michel Pla­tini and Zbig­niew Boniek.</p>
    <p>Juve won the 1983 Coppa Italia, and a year later, the tre­ble of the Serie A ti­tle, Cup Winners’ Cup and the Uefa Su­per Cup. Rossi was also top scorer with six goals as the team reached the 1983 Euro­pean Cup fi­nal, where they lost to Ham­burg.</p>
    <p>But his fi­nal game for Ju­ven­tus was marked by tragedy. At the 1985 Euro­pean Cup fi­nal, where Juve beat Liver­pool, 39 fans died in a stam­pede and wall col­lapse fol­low­ing crowd dis­tur­bances in the Hey­sel Sta­dium in Brussels, Bel­gium.</p>
