    <p>The Covid-19 pan­demic has ac­cel­er­ated the adop­tion of dig­i­tal tech­nolo­gies in some ar­eas, but this rapid shift may be leav­ing some vul­ner­a­ble groups be­hind. Hariz Ba­harudin and Yuen Sin speak to ex­perts and peo­ple from four groups in the ‘dig­i­tal ex­trem­i­ties’ to ex­am­ine the is­sue of a widen­ing dig­i­tal di­vide.</p>
    <p>While the Covid-19 pan­demic has ac­cel­er­ated dig­i­tal­i­sa­tion in some sec­tors, it has also raised con­cerns that vul­ner­a­ble seg­ments of so­ci­ety are be­ing left be­hind in a so­called dig­i­tal di­vide.</p>
    <p>In the ab­sence of a clear mea­sure of the dig­i­tal di­vide here, there are some of­fi­cial fig­ures that sug­gest there could be some who fall through the cracks.</p>
    <p>The In­fo­comm Me­dia De­vel­op­ment Au­thor­ity’s (IMDA) an­nual In­fo­comm Us­age sur­vey last year found 89 per cent of all res­i­dent house­holds owned com­put­ers, and 98 per cent of house­holds had ac­cess to broad­band In­ter­net.</p>
    <p>But the lat­est House­hold Ex­pen­di­ture Sur­vey for 2017/2018, a sep­a­rate study, found that 81 per cent of res­i­dent house­holds had a per­sonal com­puter (PC) and 87 per cent had In­ter­net ac­cess, which sug­gests that at least one in 10 house­holds here are not plugged in dig­i­tally.</p>
    <p>The same sur­vey found that fewer than half (45 per cent) of house­holds in one- and two-room Hous­ing Board flats had In­ter­net sub­scrip­tion – a sharp con­trast to the near to­tal In­ter­net pen­e­tra­tion (97 per cent) among house­holds liv­ing in pri­vate con­do­mini­ums and other apart­ments.</p>
    <p>In ac­knowl­edge­ment of this, Min­is­ter for Com­mu­ni­ca­tions and In­for­ma­tion S. Iswaran said in an in­ter­view with In­sight that a key fo­cus of his min­istry is to reach out to groups in the “dig­i­tal ex­trem­i­ties” and help them.</p>
    <p>“These are the fur­thest reaches, the last mile or the last inch, and those who you may ex­pect to per­haps be the last to adopt tech­nol­ogy, and may not have adopted it at all,” he said.</p>
    <p>Over the course of a month, In­sight spoke to ex­perts as well as peo­ple from four groups in these ex­trem­i­ties to un­der­stand their con­cerns about a widen­ing dig­i­tal di­vide.</p>
    <p>For lower-in­come stu­dents, sim­ply hav­ing ac­cess to de­vices is not enough. Ex­perts are con­cerned that they still lag be­hind their more well-off peers in mak­ing good use of tech de­vices and ser­vices.</p>
    <p>For low-wage work­ers, the dis­par­ity in ac­cess to dig­i­tal de­vices and skills could also worsen an al­ready widen­ing skills gap be­tween them and those in higher-pay­ing jobs.</p>
    <p>Also af­fected by this dig­i­tal di­vide are se­niors, some of whom still hold reser­va­tions about be­ing plugged in, and may lose out on the po­ten­tial ben­e­fits of the dig­i­tal econ­omy.</p>
    <p>And while strides have been made on the dig­i­tal front for peo­ple with dis­abil­i­ties, many apps and ser­vices still fail to fully an­tic­i­pate and ac­com­mo­date their needs.</p>
    <p>Leav­ing vul­ner­a­ble groups be­hind in this dig­i­tal di­vide could worsen cur­rent so­cial in­equal­i­ties, noted Dr Natalie Pang, a se­nior lec­turer at the Na­tional Univer­sity of Sin­ga­pore’s (NUS) De­part­ment of Com­mu­ni­ca­tions and New Me­dia.</p>
    <p>“The gap be­tween those who are more af­flu­ent and those who are not will be ex­ac­er­bated, and I think we must also be mind­ful of new di­vides that can po­ten­tially emerge,” said Dr Pang.</p>
    <p>For in­stance, chil­dren with sup­port­ive fam­i­lies who take an ac­tive role in their use of dig­i­tal de­vices and learn­ing could bet­ter build foun­da­tions to help them de­velop healthy dig­i­tal prac­tices, com­pared with a child who does not have sim­i­lar sup­port net­works. “Such out­comes are not al­ways a re­sult of in­come,” she added.</p>
    <p>Pro­fes­sor Lim Sun Sun, head of hu­man­i­ties, arts and so­cial sci­ences at the Sin­ga­pore Univer­sity of Tech­nol­ogy and De­sign, said lower-in­come adults will also be “very dis­ad­van­taged” when seek­ing work in many in­dus­tries that are dig­i­tal­is­ing if they are not equipped with dig­i­tal skills. Their so­cial mo­bil­ity will ac­cord­ingly be more lim­ited, she added.</p>
    <p>The type of de­vice that house­holds have ac­cess to also has a bear­ing on their dig­i­tal lit­er­acy, ex­perts said.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to the House­hold Ex­pen­di­ture Sur­vey, about a fifth of house­holds in one- and two-room HDB flats had ac­cess to a lap­top, while close to 8 per cent of them had ac­cess to a desk­top com­puter, as com­pared with 80 per cent and 48 per cent re­spec­tively for those in landed prop­er­ties.</p>
    <p>This sug­gests that many peo­ple in lower-in­come house­holds may be re­ly­ing only on mo­bile de­vices, like smart­phones, to ac­cess the In­ter­net.</p>
    <p>Prof Lim said re­ly­ing on smart­phones in­stead of desk­tops or lap­tops can dis­ad­van­tage work­ing adults and school-go­ing chil­dren as these are not ideal de­vices for ed­u­ca­tion and up­skilling.</p>
    <p>The di­vide in the qual­ity of In­ter­net us­age among less and more priv­i­leged house­holds could also have an im­pact on their fu­ture prospects, she noted, adding that more in­sights into the qual­ity of dig­i­tal ac­cess and the na­ture of de­vice us­age are re­quired to iden­tify the gaps in dig­i­tal skills and ac­cess to de­vices.</p>
    <p>BRIDG­ING THE GAP</p>
    <p>To help vul­ner­a­ble groups, IMDA en­hanced its NEU PC Plus pro­gramme dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker. The scheme al­lows peo­ple with dis­abil­i­ties and stu­dents aged 25 and un­der to buy a desk­top com­puter</p>
    <p>or a lap­top at prices start­ing from $220, sub­ject to in­come cri­te­ria.</p>
    <p>Ad­just­ments were made so that ben­e­fi­cia­ries could ob­tain PCs more quickly and eas­ily un­der the scheme, which also comes with an op­tion to bun­dle three years of free fi­bre broad­band sub­scrip­tion.</p>
    <p>For in­stance, pro­cess­ing times were re­duced from be­tween eight and 12 weeks to less than eight weeks, so that ben­e­fi­cia­ries could get PC bun­dles faster.</p>
    <p>Fam­i­lies with three or more school-go­ing chil­dren were al­lowed to ap­ply for a sec­ond sub­sidised PC, up from one de­vice per house­hold be­fore the cir­cuit breaker. In to­tal, close to 10,000 new ben­e­fi­cia­ries have re­ceived help from the scheme since the cir­cuit breaker.</p>
    <p>“(Lack of ac­cess to de­vices) should not be the rea­son why the child can’t have home-based learn­ing, or the par­ent can­not par­tic­i­pate in work from home... And we will find ways to help, if there is a fam­ily in need,” said Mr Iswaran, stress­ing that this is a col­lec­tive ef­fort that will need the in­volve­ment of com­pa­nies and com­mu­nity groups too.</p>
    <p>He added that the Gov­ern­ment is aim­ing for univer­sal dig­i­tal cov­er­age, in­clud­ing af­ford­able ac­cess to de­vices and dig­i­tal con­nec­tiv­ity, though he did not spec­ify a time­line.</p>
    <p>As­so­ciate Pro­fes­sor Irene Ng of the NUS So­cial Ser­vice Re­search Cen­tre and De­part­ment of So­cial Work hopes af­ford­able ac­cess to de­vices can be pro­vided in the fu­ture with­out re­quir­ing means-test­ing or a sep­a­rate ap­pli­ca­tion process.</p>
    <p>“As the NEU-PC ex­pe­ri­ence teaches us, the pro­gramme is there – yet when the cir­cuit breaker came, many fam­i­lies had not ap­plied,” she noted.</p>
    <p>In­sti­tute of Pol­icy Stud­ies se­nior re­search fel­low Carol Soon said an­other chal­lenge that has to be tack­led is how to up­grade peo­ple’s us­age of tech­nol­ogy af­ter they gain ac­cess to it, or up­date their skills.</p>
    <p>“Train­ing and de­liv­ery of con­tent should meet the per­son­alised needs of users... Peo­ple can be taught skills but they will lose them if they do not use them on a reg­u­lar ba­sis,” she said.</p>
    <p>Dig­i­tal train­ing cour­ses should also in­cor­po­rate el­e­ments of lit­er­acy, cog­ni­tive and prob­lem-solv­ing skills, added Dr Soon, citing an Or­gan­i­sa­tion for Eco­nomic Co­op­er­a­tion and De­vel­op­ment re­port which showed that nu­mer­acy skills, lit­er­acy skills and prob­lem­solv­ing skills could in­hibit peo­ple’s abil­ity to per­form more di­verse and com­plex on­line tasks.</p>
    <p>Dr Pang said pol­icy solutions should also pay at­ten­tion to the lived re­al­i­ties of var­i­ous groups that are be­ing helped, and con­sider their spe­cific needs to avoid blind spots. “Our jour­ney to dig­i­tal in­clu­sion must also be an in­clu­sive one.”</p>
