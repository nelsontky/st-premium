    <p>Want some quick tips on how you can boost your re­tire­ment plan­ning with CPF?</p>
    <p>You can now find out what you can do by log­ging in to the myCPF por­tal with your SingPass to read your newly improved dig­i­tal CPF yearly state­ment of ac­count. In­stead of just show­ing your bal­ances in the Spe­cial, Or­di­nary, MediSave and Re­tire­ment (for those 55 years and above) ac­counts, the state­ment also comes with point­ers on how you can im­prove your fi­nan­cial plan­ning. With these re­minders, you can:</p>
    <p>• Learn how you can build up your own or your loved ones’ re­tire­ment sav­ings by trans­fer­ring your CPF sav­ings from your Or­di­nary Ac­count to your Spe­cial or Re­tire­ment ac­counts, or use cash top-ups to en­joy tax re­lief.</p>
    <p>• Have an over­view of the con­tri­bu­tions you re­ceived into your CPF ac­counts in 2020. This is es­pe­cially im­por­tant for those who are self-em­ployed so that they don’t miss out in set­ting aside such sav­ings.</p>
    <p>• Check how much of the fund you have used for other pur­poses, such as home loans or med­i­cal ex­penses. If you re­alise too much money has been with­drawn for your home loan, you may want to use more cash in­stead so that your bal­ances in CPF can in­crease.</p>
    <p>• Plan for your re­tire­ment, if you are 55 and above. Your balance in your Re­tire­ment Ac­count will give you an idea of the size of your CPF Life monthly pay­out af­ter 65.</p>
    <p>• Find out how much govern­ment sup­port you had re­ceived in cash pay­outs from schemes ad­min­is­tered by the CPF Board.</p>
