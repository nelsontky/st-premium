    <p>No work pass hold­ers here have been found sleep­ing rough on the streets, con­trary to ar­ti­cles in the me­dia on home­less Malaysian work­ers in Sin­ga­pore, the Min­istry of Man­power (MOM) has said.</p>
    <p>Fol­low­ing a Nov 22 New Straits Times (NST) re­port, ti­tled Home­less Malaysians In Sin­ga­pore, MOM said it en­gaged an in­ter­vie­wee who was quoted claim­ing that more than 100 Malaysians were home­less in Sin­ga­pore as they could not af­ford rent for a room or a bed.</p>
    <p>MOM said it en­gaged Mr Shahrud­din Haeal Helmy Mohd Noh on Nov 23 and Nov 27 to ob­tain in­for­ma­tion about his claim in or­der to pro­vide as­sis­tance to th­ese work­ers.</p>
    <p>The NST, a Malaysian news­pa­per, said hun­dreds of Malaysians “had to live like va­grants fol­low­ing the Covid-19 pan­demic which saw the clo­sure of the Malaysi­aSin­ga­pore bor­der”.</p>
    <p>But Mr Shahrud­din could not pro­vide in­for­ma­tion such as spe­cific names and con­tact de­tails of the home­less Malaysian work­ers he claimed to have en­coun­tered, MOM said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>“He ad­mit­ted that he never spoke di­rectly to any of th­ese work­ers and can­not con­firm if they were in­deed home­less,” it said. “He did not know of any Malaysian worker who does not have a place to stay and also stated that he did not tell the re­porter from NST that ‘over 100 Malaysians there had be­come home­less’.”</p>
    <p>Of­fi­cers who are part of the Sin­ga­pore Gov­ern­ment’s in­ter­a­gency task force that con­ducts rou­tine checks across the is­land also vis­ited var­i­ous lo­ca­tions is­land­wide late into the night on Nov 26, in­clud­ing places listed by Mr Shahrud­din, but did not find any work pass hold­ers sleep­ing on the street, the min­istry added.</p>
    <p>Per­sons found sleep­ing in the open, in­clud­ing work pass hold­ers, are ren­dered help, said MOM.</p>
    <p>Their em­ployer will be asked to pro­vide lodg­ing im­me­di­ately, and if they can­not do so the Mi­grant</p>
    <p>Work­ers’ Cen­tre (MWC) will house them in the interim, it said.</p>
    <p>“MOM has also es­tab­lished links with var­i­ous non-govern­men­tal or­gan­i­sa­tions (NGOs) to re­fer any work pass hold­ers found sleep­ing rough,” it added. “In the past few months, MOM has not re­ceived any re­fer­rals from the NGOs.”</p>
    <p>The Straits Times re­ported yes­ter­day that the 21 tem­po­rary shel­ters for the home­less here are mostly full, with about 100 peo­ple on the wait list.</p>
    <p>One rea­son for the cur­rent short­age of shel­ter space is in­creased de­mand, in­clud­ing from those who can no longer make the daily com­mute be­tween Sin­ga­pore, where they work, and their homes in Jo­hor Baru or Batam due to travel re­stric­tions, said a spokesman for char­ity Home­less Hearts of Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>Em­ploy­ers here are obliged to en­sure that their for­eign em­ploy­ees have proper ac­com­mo­da­tion dur­ing their stay in Sin­ga­pore, said the min­istry.</p>
    <p>Mem­bers of the pub­lic who know of any work pass hold­ers fac­ing ac­com­mo­da­tion is­sues should re­fer them to MOM or the MWC’s 24-hour hot­line on 6536-2692 for fur­ther as­sis­tance.</p>
