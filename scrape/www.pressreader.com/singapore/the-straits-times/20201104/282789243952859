    <p>Martha (not her real name), who is in her 50s, has been car­ing for her mother, who has de­men­tia, for about six years now.</p>
    <p>When she takes her mother to see me at the clinic, she of­ten shares a lit­tle bit about the care­giv­ing chal­lenges she faces.</p>
    <p>At times when she has to hold back her tears, she talks about how her mother no longer recog­nises her. She said her mother be­haves more like an in­fant as her de­men­tia be­comes more ad­vanced.</p>
    <p>Be­ing the sole care­giver of her mother is dif­fi­cult. Martha is re­spon­si­ble for ev­ery as­pect of her mother’s care, from chang­ing her di­a­pers to feed­ing her to tak­ing her for med­i­cal ap­point­ments.</p>
    <p>The Well-be­ing Of The Sin­ga­pore El­derly Study, con­ducted in 2013, found that one in 10 peo­ple here aged 60 and older has de­men­tia. The ma­jor­ity of such peo­ple re­quire care and su­per­vi­sion to vary­ing de­grees, de­pend­ing on their needs.</p>
    <p>A care­giver usu­ally has to learn how to do so, mak­ing sure the per­son he is car­ing for does not walk off and get lost in the com­mu­nity. He has to pro­vide nurs­ing care.</p>
    <p>It can be a thank­less job – his loved one may not ap­pre­ci­ate all that is be­ing done for him and may even ex­hibit ag­gres­sion and ir­ri­tabil­ity as part of his de­men­tia.</p>
    <p>On top of this, some car­ers may lack re­sources and other forms of sup­port. As a re­sult, care­givers can ex­pe­ri­ence a range of emo­tional is­sues, which can wax and wane through­out the course of the af­fected per­son’s ill­ness.</p>
    <p>GRIEV­ING AND BURNT OUT</p>
    <p>As the af­fected per­son be­gins to lose the abil­ity to recog­nise peo­ple and his care needs in­crease, a care­giver can ex­pe­ri­ence emo­tions sim­i­lar to grief as he knows that his loved one is surely los­ing the sense of self and iden­tity.</p>
    <p>Watch­ing this process from the side­lines is es­pe­cially dif­fi­cult for the care­giver, if he is in a close re­la­tion­ship with the pa­tient.</p>
    <p>It is also tough on a care­giver if the af­fected per­son is con­sid­ered young (as in the case of youn­gon­set de­men­tia) and there is the feel­ing of a per­ceived loss of po­ten­tial.</p>
    <p>Some af­fected peo­ple have school-go­ing chil­dren whom they would have sup­ported if not for the ill­ness.</p>
    <p>Be­cause of the sense of loss that de­men­tia trig­gers in care­givers, some go through the five stages of grief. These emo­tional stages in­clude de­nial, anger, bar­gain­ing, de­pres­sion (or de­spair) and ac­cep­tance, though they may not be ex­pe­ri­enced in this or­der.</p>
    <p>Oth­ers go through only some of the stages. It is use­ful for care­givers and fam­ily mem­bers to recog­nise these stages and sup­port one another as their loved one with de­men­tia pro­gresses in the ill­ness.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing the course of car­ing for a per­son with de­men­tia, a care­giver may ex­pe­ri­ence pe­ri­ods of in­creased stress and even burnout.</p>
    <p>Some de­men­tia pa­tients can de­velop in­creased ir­ri­tabil­ity, poor sleep and para­noia. Even with­out these symp­toms, a per­son with de­men­tia can have high nurs­ing needs if they are wheel­chair users or bed-bound.</p>
    <p>For these rea­sons, care­giv­ing can stretch car­ers to their lim­its, es­pe­cially if they are un­able to get enough rest.</p>
    <p>Burnout can re­sult in a care­giver feel­ing more frus­trated and an­gry. This may lead to phys­i­cal abuse and ne­glect of the per­son with de­men­tia.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing the course of car­ing for a per­son with de­men­tia, a care­giver may ex­pe­ri­ence pe­ri­ods of in­creased stress and even burnout.</p>
    <p>SEEK­ING HELP</p>
    <p>Some­times, a care­giver may de­velop men­tal health is­sues be­yond grief or burnout. While it is nor­mal for him to ex­pe­ri­ence some ad­just­ment is­sues, as well as oc­ca­sional low mood, tear­ful­ness and anger, pro­fes­sional help may be­come nec­es­sary if these is­sues are pro­longed, se­vere or af­fect a per­son’s daily func­tion­ing.</p>
    <p>A care­giver has an in­creased risk of de­vel­op­ing de­pres­sion and anx­i­ety – and these may cause him to have poor sleep and ap­petite, low mo­ti­va­tion and en­ergy lev­els, and dif­fi­cul­ties ful­fill­ing his du­ties as a care­giver to the per­son with de­men­tia.</p>
    <p>In the more ex­treme cases, if a carer feels hope­less or stuck about his sit­u­a­tion, he may de­velop thoughts of sui­cide or even homi­ci­dal thoughts to­wards the per­son he is look­ing after.</p>
    <p>De­spite the po­ten­tial men­tal health is­sues of look­ing after a per­son with de­men­tia, there are sev­eral av­enues of sup­port avail­able for care­givers.</p>
    <p>The Alzheimer’s Dis­ease As­so­ci­a­tion (ADA) pro­vides coun­selling, train­ing and sup­port groups for care­givers, as well as other use­ful re­sources.</p>
    <p>Get­ting in touch with a com­mu­nity so­cial worker, such as through ADA or a Fam­ily Ser­vice Cen­tre, would en­able car­ers to tap other sources of sup­port, such as de­men­tia day care and fi­nan­cial as­sis­tance.</p>
    <p>Prac­ti­cal help com­ing from friends, rel­a­tives and neigh­bours would also en­able the main carer to take time off for him­self and recharge.</p>
    <p>While it is im­por­tant for care­givers to recog­nise when they need help, hav­ing another per­son watch out for them is use­ful in pre­vent­ing a sit­u­a­tion from es­ca­lat­ing.</p>
    <p>Help is also avail­able through var­i­ous helplines such as the Sa­mar­i­tans of Sin­ga­pore hotline.</p>
    <p>The life ex­pectancy for an el­derly per­son with de­men­tia varies from five to 12 years. There­fore, care­givers should ex­pect that look­ing after their loved one is like run­ning a marathon in some as­pects and tak­ing care of a child in oth­ers.</p>
    <p>Like a marathon, the jour­ney is long, but it can be mean­ing­ful and ful­fill­ing.</p>
    <p>Like car­ing for a child, other peo­ple are in­volved and you are not alone in pro­vid­ing care.</p>
