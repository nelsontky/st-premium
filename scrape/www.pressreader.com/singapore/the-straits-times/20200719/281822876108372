    <p>Seated in a fash­ion­ably dim cafe in Bangkok’s his­toric Charoen Krung dis­trict, Hong Kong so­cial me­dia in­flu­encer Roger Wu pre­pared to launch into his lat­est topic: Is Thai­land a suit­able place for you to re­lo­cate to?</p>
    <p>“Some friends say, ‘I now feel like mov­ing else­where, like Thai­land’. But I want to ask: ‘How many times have you been to Thai­land? Do you re­ally un­der­stand Thai­land?’” he ad­dressed his YouTube fans in rapid-fire Can­tonese.</p>
    <p>“They say ‘we hol­i­dayed here twice’. That’s like ask­ing a woman to marry you af­ter you met her twice!”</p>
    <p>The video, up­loaded last Thurs­day, has drawn over 39,000 views.</p>
    <p>“I spoke about this topic be­cause more and more peo­ple were ask­ing me about it,” Mr Wu told The Sun­day Times. “I did this video so that I didn’t need to ex­plain the same thing 10 or 20 times a day.”</p>
    <p>Mr Wu, who runs the website thai­land­fans.com from his base in Bangkok, is Hong Kongers’ go-to for tips on the king­dom.</p>
    <p>Lately, he has been get­ting more queries from peo­ple want­ing to buy prop­erty in Thai­land.</p>
    <p>While he shies away from draw­ing any con­clu­sions about this grow­ing in­ter­est, ob­servers link it partly to the un­ease about Hong Kong’s new security law, which schol­ars say will erode the ter­ri­tory’s ju­di­cial in­de­pen­dence and de­mol­ish free­dom of assembly and speech.</p>
    <p>Hong Kong res­i­dents who had ex­pressed sup­port for last year’s street protests have started scrub­bing their so­cial me­dia ac­counts to avoid run­ning afoul of the sweep­ing law, which crim­i­nalises sub­ver­sion and col­lu­sion with for­eign forces.</p>
    <p>In­vestors are seek­ing to di­ver­sify their as­sets and buy sec­ond homes fur­ther from Bei­jing’s reach.</p>
    <p>“There are in­deed peo­ple who are wor­ried about the sit­u­a­tion and think­ing of not so much sell­ing ev­ery­thing but maybe di­ver­si­fy­ing some of their port­fo­lio away from Hong Kong,” said Natixis bank econ­o­mist Gary Ng.</p>
    <p>“In such un­cer­tain times, it’s hard to avoid any geopo­lit­i­cal risk. Of course there is (risk) in Hong Kong, but it ex­ists else­where as well,” he said, adding that these peo­ple may also re­lo­cate.</p>
    <p>The United States, for ex­am­ple, re­moved Hong Kong’s pref­er­en­tial trade sta­tus last week and plans to sanc­tion en­ti­ties that have eroded the ter­ri­tory’s au­ton­omy.</p>
    <p>This has drawn threats of re­tal­i­a­tion from Bei­jing that may even­tu­ally em­broil the re­gion in a proxy race for dom­i­nance.</p>
    <p>READY TO UP STAKES</p>
    <p>It is still too early to tell if Hong Kong will see a net cap­i­tal out­flow. The grow­ing pres­ence of main­land Chi­nese banks in the city, for ex­am­ple, gives the ter­ri­tory some fi­nan­cial bal­last, said Mr Ng.</p>
    <p>For now, Hong Kong res­i­dents are weigh­ing their op­tions.</p>
    <p>One is Malaysia’s long-stay scheme for for­eign ci­ti­zens will­ing to park at least RM150,000 (S$49,000) in the coun­try.</p>
    <p>Called the Malaysia My Sec­ond Home (MM2H) pro­gramme, it is pop­u­lar with peo­ple from China, Hong Kong and South Korea.</p>
    <p>Aubella, the largest agency for the scheme, has re­ceived ap­pli­ca­tions from al­most 2,000 fam­i­lies in Hong Kong since Jan­uary last year. In 2018, it re­ceived just 200.</p>
    <p>“There are in­ter­nal fac­tors and push fac­tors for the clients which make them de­cide faster,” said Aubella founder Vin­cent Fong.</p>
    <p>Thai­land has a sim­i­lar scheme which al­lows for­eign ci­ti­zens to live in the king­dom for five to 20 years, if they pay a one-time fee up­wards of 500,000 baht (S$22,000).</p>
    <p>As of last month, there were more than 10,000 of these “Thai­land Elite Card” hold­ers.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to Hen­ley and Part­ners, its global con­ces­sion­aire, ap­pli­ca­tions from Hong Kong from Jan­uary to March quadru­pled over the same pe­riod last year.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, the over­seas prop­erty scene in Hong Kong is buzzing.</p>
    <p>Last month, there were 152 over­seas prop­erty ex­hi­bi­tions there, mostly fea­tur­ing homes in Bri­tain, Malaysia, Aus­tralia and Thai­land, said Mr Eli McGeever, a vice-pres­i­dent at Soho prop­erty app firm.</p>
    <p>In the lat­ter half of last year, as anti-gov­ern­ment protests warmed in­ter­est in over­seas prop­erty, Hong Kong buy­ers ze­roed in on Malaysia, he said.</p>
    <p>“Malaysia re­ceived ex­tremely strong in­ter­est – it went months with at least 10 ex­hi­bi­tions ev­ery week­end and some ex­hi­bi­tions had thou­sands of RSVPs. The MM2H was a strong draw­card as it of­fered a rel­a­tively cheap, easy and closeby Plan B,” he said.</p>
    <p>This year, the spot­light shifted to Bri­tish prop­er­ties be­cause Lon­don dan­gled the pos­si­bil­ity of ci­ti­zen­ship for some three mil­lion Hong Kong res­i­dents, he said.</p>
    <p>Thai prop­erty bro­ker­age Bridge Es­tate, which spe­cialises in serv­ing over­seas buy­ers, said its Hong Kong buy­ers are now keen on homes worth 10 mil­lion baht to 20 mil­lion baht rather than those in the 3 mil­lion baht to 7 mil­lion baht cat­e­gory – their pre­vi­ous sweet spot for in­vest­ment prop­er­ties.</p>
    <p>Bridge Es­tate man­ag­ing di­rec­tor Pitchakorn Meesak sur­mised that it is be­cause they are now buy­ing res­i­dences with an eye on stay­ing in them.</p>
    <p>“To­day, more than 80 per cent are look­ing for a sec­ond home. Their in­ter­est has changed to lux­ury projects,” she told The Sun­day Times.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore prop­er­ties, in con­trast, re­ceive lit­tle in­ter­est from Hong Kong buy­ers be­cause the 20 per cent ad­di­tional buyer’s stamp duty that ap­plies to for­eign­ers makes them un­ap­peal­ing, said Mr Ni­cholas Mak, head of research and con­sul­tancy at ERA Realty.</p>
    <p>THE FI­NAN­CIAL HUB UP­SHOT</p>
    <p>It may take months to see the full im­pact of Hong Kong’s new security law.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore, of­ten quoted as a ri­val fi­nan­cial hub, has yet to see sig­nif­i­cant in­flow of funds from Hong Kong.</p>
    <p>“From Sin­ga­pore’s per­spec­tive, we’d rather see a suc­cess­ful Hong Kong. It’s bet­ter to com­pete with a strong, strong fi­nan­cial cen­tre, be­cause that means growth and op­por­tu­ni­ties in the whole re­gion are good,” said Mon­e­tary Au­thor­ity of</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore man­ag­ing di­rec­tor Ravi Menon last week.</p>
    <p>Other as­pir­ing fi­nan­cial hubs are eye­ing Hong Kong’s wealth and tal­ent. Dis­cus­sions have be­gun in Ja­pan’s Par­lia­ment to fast-track visas for Hong Kong fi­nan­cial tal­ent.</p>
    <p>Rul­ing Lib­eral Demo­cratic Party politi­cian Sat­suki Katayama, who chairs a panel on for­eign tal­ent, said last month that the kind of tal­ent who have made Hong Kong a re­gional hub is “pre­cisely the kind of high-level tal­ent our coun­try de­sires and is work­ing to bring in”.</p>
    <p>But Ja­pan, bogged down by high taxes and lim­ited English use, is unat­trac­tive to ex­pa­tri­ates.</p>
    <p>The gov­ern­ment of South Korea’s Bu­san city an­nounced on June 16 its am­bi­tion to be­come the next Asian fi­nan­cial hub, say­ing it will work with com­pa­nies housed at the Bu­san In­ter­na­tional Finance Cen­tre to ap­proach fi­nan­cial firms plan­ning to exit Hong Kong.</p>
    <p>The au­thor­i­ties plan to hold on­line meet­ings with Hong Kong­based firms, as well as visit them and con­duct road­shows once travel re­stric­tions are lifted.</p>
    <p>But South Korea is sim­i­larly hob­bled by its high cor­po­rate tax of 25 per cent and long work week.</p>
    <p>A re­cent gov­ern­ment survey ask­ing for­eign fi­nan­cial firms based in South Korea to rate the coun­try’s ap­peal in re­plac­ing Hong Kong as Asia’s next fi­nan­cial hub drew mostly neg­a­tive re­sponses.</p>
