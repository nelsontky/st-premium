    <p>NEW YORK • Zip­ping through water like shim­mer­ing ar­row­heads, cut­tle­fish are swift, sure hunters – death on eight limbs and two wav­ing ten­ta­cles for small crea­tures in their vicin­ity.</p>
    <p>They morph to match the land­scape, shift­ing be­tween a va­ri­ety of hues and even tex­tures, us­ing tiny struc­tures that ex­pand and con­tract be­neath their skin.</p>
    <p>They even seem to have depth per­cep­tion, re­searchers us­ing tiny 3D vi­sion glasses found, plac­ing them apart from oc­to­puses and squids. And their ac­cu­racy at strik­ing prey is re­mark­able.</p>
    <p>But for cut­tle­fish, these phys­i­cal feats in pur­suit of food are not the whole story.</p>
    <p>A new study pub­lished last month in the Royal So­ci­ety Open Sci­ence jour­nal shows that there is even more to cut­tle­fish cog­ni­tion than sci­en­tists may have known. They ap­pear to be ca­pa­ble of per­form­ing cal­cu­la­tions that are more com­pli­cated than sim­ply “more food is bet­ter”.</p>
    <p>Pre­sented with a choice be­tween one shrimp or two, they will ac­tu­ally choose the sin­gle shrimp af­ter learn­ing from ex­pe­ri­ence that they will be re­warded for this choice.</p>
    <p>While the brain­i­ness of their oc­to­pus cousins gets a lot of at­ten­tion, re­searchers who study an­i­mal cog­ni­tion have un­cov­ered sur­pris­ing tal­ents in cut­tle­fish over the years.</p>
    <p>For in­stance, the cephalopod­s will hunt fewer crabs dur­ing the day if they learn that shrimp, their pre­ferred food, is pre­dictably avail­able dur­ing the night. That shows that they can think ahead.</p>
    <p>Bi­ol­o­gist Chiao Chuan-chin from Tai­wan’s Na­tional Ts­ing Hua Univer­sity, and an au­thor of the study along­side col­league Kuo Tzu-hsin, has found in the past that hun­gry cut­tle­fish will pick a big­ger, harder-to-catch shrimp to at­tack.</p>
    <p>Those that are not hun­gry will pick smaller, eas­ier-to-catch ones.</p>
    <p>But re­searchers have also found that an­i­mals do not al­ways make de­ci­sions that seem log­i­cal at first glance.</p>
    <p>They found that an­i­mals, like hu­mans, re­spond to their en­vi­ron­ments us­ing learnt ex­pe­ri­ences.</p>
    <p>In these new ex­per­i­ments, curi</p>
    <p>ous to see whether they could al­ter the value that cut­tle­fish at­tach to a sin­gle shrimp, the re­searchers gave the cut­tle­fish the op­tion of en­ter­ing a cham­ber with one shrimp or a cham­ber with none.</p>
    <p>Each time they en­tered the cham­ber with a shrimp, the re­searchers gave them a smaller shrimp as a re­ward.</p>
    <p>Then each cut­tle­fish took a se­cond test. They could en­ter a cham­ber and chase af­ter two shrimps. Or they could en­ter another cham­ber that had only one.</p>
    <p>“You’d think they al­ways choose the larger quan­tity,” Dr Chiao said. But that was not what hap­pened.</p>
    <p>In the se­cond round, the cut­tle­fish chose one shrimp sig­nif­i­cantly more of­ten than two.</p>
    <p>Cut­tle­fish that had not un­der­gone the train­ing re­li­ably picked two shrimps over one, de­mon</p>
    <p>strat­ing that cut­tle­fish that chose the smaller num­ber were anticipati­ng the re­ward and op­er­at­ing dif­fer­ently than their fel­lows.</p>
    <p>Even wait­ing un­til an hour had passed since the ini­tial train­ing did not com­pletely erase the new be­hav­iour.</p>
    <p>The process of be­ing re­warded for choos­ing one shrimp seems to have given that op­tion an ex­tra glow as far as cut­tle­fish are con­cerned, Dr Chiao said.</p>
    <p>It sug­gests that they are not sim­ply mak­ing ba­sic re­sponses to prey they come across – they are re­mem­ber­ing what has come be­fore and us­ing it to make a choice.</p>
    <p>Even if in this sit­u­a­tion, the be­hav­iour did not re­sult in a big­ger haul, it adds to the ev­i­dence that cut­tle­fish are com­plex crea­tures, ca­pa­ble of us­ing their brains in ways that may sur­prise many, the re­searchers said.</p>
