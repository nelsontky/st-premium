    <p>A man was charged yes­ter­day with mur­der­ing his wife.</p>
    <p>Ap­pear­ing be­fore a dis­trict court via video­con­fer­enc­ing, Chi­nese na­tional Cui Huan, 24, was ac­cused of killing Ms Liang Xue­qiu, 26, at a foot­path at Block 211 Boon Lay Place on Thurs­day. Cui did not dis­play any emo­tions when the charges were read out to him.</p>
    <p>Po­lice had ear­lier said they re­ceived a call for as­sis­tance around 6.30pm on Thurs­day. Of­fi­cers who ar­rived at the scene found a woman in­jured and ly­ing mo­tion­less. She was un­con­scious when taken to Ng Teng Fong Gen­eral Hos­pi­tal and pro­nounced dead at the hos­pi­tal at 9.58pm.</p>
    <p>Of­fi­cers from the Crim­i­nal In­ves­ti­ga­tion Depart­ment and Jurong Po­lice Di­vi­sion ar­rested the man within three hours of the re­ported in­ci­dent.</p>
    <p>Some res­i­dents of the Boon Lay block whom The Sun­day Times spoke to on Friday evening said they saw the po­lice cor­don off the crime scene on Thurs­day night.</p>
    <p>One res­i­dent said he rushed out of his home to try to help the vic­tim, af­ter his younger brother told him about the woman ly­ing mo­tion­less on the ground floor.</p>
    <p>Mr Mo­hamed Nas­rul­lah, 20, a stu­dent and part-time de­liv­ery rider, said that when he ar­rived at the scene, there were about 10 by­standers. He called the po­lice for help and they ar­rived about 10 min­utes later. An­other res­i­dent called the Sin­ga­pore Civil De­fence Force.</p>
    <p>“The by­standers were stand­ing around with­out call­ing the po­lice so I de­cided to... make the call,” said Mr Nas­rul­lah.</p>
    <p>He had not seen the vic­tim in the neigh­bour­hood be­fore and was shocked when he was told she had died.</p>
    <p>Cui has been re­manded and his case is ad­journed to Friday.</p>
    <p>Those con­victed of mur­der face the death penalty or life im­pris­on­ment with can­ing. avail­able com­mer­cially and used for var­i­ous pur­poses, such as mak­ing bone china. Ms Crys­tal Tan, who con­ducted the test, told The Sun­day Times the pow­dery sub­stance ap­peared “fine and ho­mo­ge­neous” un­der the mi­cro­scope, which was vis­ually dif­fer­ent from other pet re­mains she had ex­am­ined in the past.</p>
    <p>When con­tacted by ST, Mr Lim said there was no prob­lem with the re­mains found in Nova’s urn and ex­plained that he rou­tinely ground dog ashes to fit into urns.</p>
    <p>“Hav­ing the bone frag­ments ground down prop­erly is part of our stan­dard process to fit the bones into smaller urns,” Mr Lim said. The process is quick and takes “five min­utes per dog”, he said. Mr Lim said his com­pany uses at least six cre­ma­tion fur­naces across Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>Pet cre­ma­tion ser­vices in Sin­ga­pore are not re­quired to be reg­is­tered, ac­cord­ing to the An­i­mal and</p>
    <p>Vet­eri­nary Ser­vices (AVS) run by the Na­tional Parks Board.</p>
    <p>There are, how­ever, two pet cre­ma­tion ser­vice providers op­er­at­ing within AVS-li­censed premises: Mount Pleas­ant Vet­eri­nary Cen­tre at 5 Mandai Road and The An­i­mal Re­sort at Sele­tar West Farmway 5.</p>
    <p>Mr Ilex Tan of Rain­bow Paradise Pet Cre­ma­tion Ser­vices told ST that bone frag­ments in a pet’s ashes usu­ally would not need to be ground into pow­der unless cus­tomers want to make a pen­dant vial of the ashes. The grind­ing of ashes is not a com­mon prac­tice, as own­ers gen­er­ally do not want to dis­turb their pet’s ashes out of re­spect, he said.</p>
    <p>“You can def­i­nitely still see some small bone frag­ments, and the colour of the ground ash will def­i­nitely re­sem­ble that of cre­mated re­mains,” he said.</p>
