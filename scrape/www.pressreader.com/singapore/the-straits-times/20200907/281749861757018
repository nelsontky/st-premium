    <p>CHAL­LENG­ING FIRST YEAR</p>
    <p>It was a sur­pris­ing first year full of chal­lenges. Covid-19 ar­rived barely four months af­ter our of­fi­cial open­ing. The mag­ni­tude and speed of its spread were un­prece­dented. We had to ramp up the en­tire fa­cil­ity be­yond the orig­i­nal de­sign of 330 beds to more than 500 beds at one point dur­ing the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>PRO­FES­SOR LEO YEE SIN, ex­ec­u­tive di­rec­tor of the Na­tional Cen­tre for In­fec­tious Dis­eases.</p>
    <p>The Na­tional Cen­tre for In­fec­tious Dis­eases (NCID) has been at the heart of the bat­tle against the Covid-19 pan­demic – a real bap­tism of fire for the 330-bed fa­cil­ity that was in­au­gu­rated only a year ago to­day.</p>
    <p>It was ex­pected that the NCID would ease its way to­wards be­ing in the van­guard of Sin­ga­pore’s bat­tle against any in­fec­tious dis­eases.</p>
    <p>But less than six months af­ter its of­fi­cial open­ing, it was plunged into com­bat­ing a global pan­demic.</p>
    <p>It not only had to open up its 330 beds more quickly than an­tic­i­pated, but also had to ex­pand ca­pac­ity to ac­com­mo­date more pa­tients. It also had to train more staff to cope with the surge in pa­tients.</p>
    <p>Look­ing back at the past 12 months, Pro­fes­sor Leo Yee Sin, ex­ec­u­tive di­rec­tor of the NCID, said: “It was a sur­pris­ing first year full of chal­lenges. Covid-19 ar­rived barely four months af­ter our of­fi­cial open­ing.</p>
    <p>“The mag­ni­tude and speed of its spread were un­prece­dented. We had to ramp up the en­tire fa­cil­ity be­yond the orig­i­nal de­sign of 330 beds to more than 500 beds at one point dur­ing the pan­demic.”</p>
    <p>For­tu­nately, NCID’s de­sign al­lowed for it to be scaled up should the need arise. Nev­er­the­less, hav­ing to nearly dou­ble ca­pac­ity so quickly was chal­leng­ing.</p>
    <p>Said Prof Leo: “Be­cause of the na­ture of its de­sign to en­sure clear seg­re­ga­tion of peo­ple and ma­te­ri­als flow, it takes time to fa­mil­iarise one­self and be able to nav­i­gate within the build­ing safely.”</p>
    <p>Staff who were trained in in­fec­tion con­trol had to forgo their leave to work with nurses from Tan Tock Seng Hos­pi­tal (TTSH) next door who were trans­ferred over to help. Al­though they are trained nurses, they had not worked in a pan­demic en­vi­ron­ment.</p>
    <p>The staff at NCID, said Prof Leo, were trained in ar­eas like in­fec­tion con­trol; use of per­sonal pro­tec­tive equip­ment and pow­ered air-pu­ri­fy­ing res­pi­ra­tor; and care of pa­tients with higher acu­ity needs. They were kept up to date with out­break drills and knew what to do.</p>
    <p>So the “bor­rowed” TTSH staff were paired with their NCID coun­ter­parts “who are well versed in the work­place and pro­cesses”.</p>
    <p>The NCID staff – from doc­tors and nurses to re­searchers – had to move fast to cope with a new, to­tally un­known virus.</p>
    <p>The Na­tional Pub­lic Health Lab­o­ra­tory, which is housed in the same</p>
    <p>build­ing, be­gan de­vel­op­ing a gen­eral coron­avirus test on Jan 2.</p>
    <p>When China re­leased the ge­netic se­quence for the coron­avirus that caused Covid-19, the lab­o­ra­tory de­signed a test for the new Sars-CoV-2 virus and de­tected the first case of an in­fected per­son in Sin­ga­pore, a vis­i­tor from China, on Jan 23.</p>
    <p>To­gether with the Duke-NUS Med­i­cal School, it de­vel­oped a test kit to iden­tify those who were in­fected pre­vi­ously and had re­cov­ered.</p>
    <p>In a tes­ta­ment to NCID’s per­for­mance over the last year, Prof Leo co-chaired the team that drew up the World Health Or­gan­i­sa­tion guide­line for steroid use in Covid-19 pa­tients, re­leased last Wed­nes­day.</p>
    <p>Al­though the num­ber of new Covid-19 in­fec­tions has de­clined sig­nif­i­cantly in Sin­ga­pore, Prof Leo said her team is “still work­ing at full steam to meet new de­mands and pro­gres­sively ramp up our reg­u­lar ser­vices”.</p>
    <p>Some of these reg­u­lar ser­vices – fo­cus­ing on other in­fec­tious dis­eases, rang­ing from tu­ber­cu­lo­sis to chick­en­pox, had to be put on hold while the team con­cen­trated on Covid-19.</p>
