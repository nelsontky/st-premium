    <p>KUALA LUMPUR • For­mer Malaysian prime min­is­ter Ma­hathir Mo­hamad re­ceived more crit­i­cism yes­ter­day over his tweet the pre­vi­ous day that “Mus­lims have a right to be angry and to kill mil­lions of French peo­ple for the mas­sacres of the past”.</p>
    <p>But he de­fended him­self yes­ter­day, say­ing that his fol­low­ing sen­tence, that Mus­lims did not take re­venge even though they had the right to, was left out by the me­dia.</p>
    <p>Tun Dr Ma­hathir added that his plea for France to show re­spect for peo­ple’s be­liefs was also cast aside in the rush to at­tack him.</p>
    <p>Speak­ing about the me­dia in gen­eral, he said: “On the one hand, they de­fended those who chose to dis­play of­fend­ing car­i­ca­tures of Prophet Muham­mad and ex­pect all Mus­lims to swal­low it in the name of free­dom of speech and ex­pres­sion.</p>
    <p>“On the other, they deleted de­lib­er­ately that Mus­lims had never sought re­venge for the in­jus­tice against them in the past.”</p>
    <p>Sarawak Deputy Chief Min­is­ter James Mas­ing, re­spond­ing to news re­ports on Dr Ma­hathir’s com­ments, said: “Ma­hathir’s com­ments on the killing of non-Mus­lims in France are a re­flec­tion of who he is as a per­son. It’s not Malaysian. We live and abide by the rule of law.”</p>
    <p>Dr Ma­hathir’s com­ments on Thurs­day came at a time of height­ened ten­sions in France.</p>
    <p>This was soon af­ter two peo­ple were killed in a Nice basil­ica, in­clud­ing a 60-year-old woman who was nearly de­cap­i­tated. A third vic­tim died later of her in­juries.</p>
    <p>The at­tack in Nice came less than two weeks af­ter the be­head­ing of a teacher shook the na­tion and led to Pres­i­dent Em­manuel Macron sug­gest­ing that Is­lam was in need of an en­light­en­ment.</p>
    <p>The teacher was be­headed by an 18-year-old Chechen who felt of­fended that the ed­u­ca­tion­ist had shown car­toons of the Prophet dur­ing a class on free speech.</p>
    <p>United States Am­bas­sador to Malaysia Ka­mala Shirin Lakhd­hir yes­ter­day ex­tended her con­do­lences to the French vic­tims. She added: “I strongly dis­agree with Tun Dr Ma­hathir’s re­cent state­ment. Free­dom of ex­pres­sion is a right, call­ing for vi­o­lence is not.”</p>
    <p>On Dr Ma­hathir’s blog, some 6,000 angry com­ments were left fol­low­ing his post.</p>
    <p>One com­ment read: “Is this the lan­guage of a re­spected leader ...?????? It’s to­tally vi­o­lent.”</p>
    <p>In Dr Ma­hathir’s post, fol­low­ing his com­ments that Mus­lims had the right to kill mil­lions of French, he had added: “By and large, the Mus­lims have not ap­plied the ‘eye for an eye’ law. Mus­lims don’t. The French shouldn’t. In­stead, the French should teach their peo­ple to re­spect other peo­ple’s feel­ings.”</p>
    <p>But th­ese words have been drowned out by what many see as a call for vi­o­lence.</p>
    <p>For­mer premier Na­jib Razak, who was top­pled from power in 2018 by Dr Ma­hathir, tweeted yes­ter­day in ref­er­ence to Dr Ma­hathir’s blog: “The world should calm down and read @chedetof­fi­cial’s state­ment in its full con­text.</p>
    <p>“I’m sure he didn’t mean ex­actly what he said. And even if he did, it’s his per­sonal opin­ion, not Malaysia’s.”</p>
    <p>In In­done­sia, its For­eign Min­istry said in a state­ment: “In­done­sia con­demns the state­ments made by the Pres­i­dent of France that are dis­re­spect­ful to­wards Is­lam and the Mus­lim com­mu­nity world­wide. The state­ment has of­fended over two bil­lion Mus­lims glob­ally and has sparked di­vi­sion among dif­fer­ent faiths in the world.”</p>
