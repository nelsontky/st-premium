    <p>OR­LANDO • LeBron James took to the Dis­ney World court on Fri­day know­ing he fin­ished sec­ond to Mil­wau­kee Bucks for­ward Gian­nis An­te­tok­oun­mpo in the Na­tional Bas­ket­ball As­so­ci­a­tion (NBA) Most Valu­able Player vot­ing.</p>
    <p>He said the re­sult “pissed me off” but is a step closer to win­ning a big­ger prize: a fourth NBA ring.</p>
    <p>James had 15 points, 12 as­sists and six re­bounds as the Los An­ge­les Lak­ers dom­i­nated the Den­ver</p>
    <p>Nuggets 126-114 in Game 1 of the Western Con­fer­ence Fi­nals.</p>
    <p>An­thony Davis led all scor­ers with 37 points and pulled down 10 re­bounds for the Lak­ers, who shot out of the gate af­ter drop­ping their opener in each of their pre­vi­ous two play-off se­ries in the NBA’s coro­n­avirus quar­an­tine bubble in Or­lando, Florida.</p>
    <p>The Lak­ers kept up the pres­sure af­ter the break, per­haps aware that the Nuggets had proved their re­silience with some big sec­ond-half come­backs to beat the Los An­ge­les Clip­pers 4-3 in the pre­vi­ous round.</p>
    <p>Den­ver trimmed the deficit to nine points mid­way through the third quar­ter. But their ef­forts were ham­pered by stars Nikola Jo­kic, Ja­mal Mur­ray and Paul Mill­sap all get­ting into early foul trou­ble, and that was the clos­est they would get in the sec­ond half.</p>
    <p>Jo­kic and Mur­ray both scored 21 points to pace the Nuggets.</p>
    <p>The best-of-seven se­ries con­tin­ues with Game 2 today, when the Lak­ers ex­pect a fired-up James.</p>
    <p>“It def­i­nitely sparks him and, like, he got a chip on his shoul­der like he’s got some­thing to prove,” Davis said of James’ re­ceiv­ing just 16 first-place votes to An­te­tok­oun­mpo’s 85 from the group of sports writ­ers and broad­cast­ers.</p>
    <p>An­te­tok­oun­mpo, 25, was named NBA MVP for the sec­ond straight sea­son af­ter im­prov­ing his sta­tis­tics from last year, av­er­ag­ing ca­reer highs in points (29.5) and re­bounds (13.6) in fewer min­utes. He also led the Bucks to the league’s best reg­u­lar-sea­son record (56-17) and won the league’s De­fen­sive Player of The Year Award.</p>
    <p>“It pissed me off be­cause out of 101 votes I got 16 first-place votes. That’s what pissed me off more than any­thing,” James said.</p>
    <p>“Let’s not get it twisted. I’m great. The vot­ing scale is a lit­tle weird for me some­times.”</p>
