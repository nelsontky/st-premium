    <p>WILL I NEED TO PROVE I’VE BEEN VAC­CI­NATED TO TRAVEL?</p>
    <p>Last month, Qan­tas Air­ways an­nounced that once a coro­n­avirus vac­cine was avail­able, pas­sen­gers hop­ing to fly on the air­line would need to prove that they had taken it. Mr Alan Joyce, the air­line’s chief ex­ec­u­tive, de­scribed the need for proof of vac­ci­na­tion as “a ne­ces­sity”.</p>
    <p>“I think that’s go­ing to be a com­mon thing talk­ing to my col­leagues in other air­lines around the globe,” he said.</p>
    <p>In­deed, many air­lines are test­ing tech­nol­ogy to stream­line the health doc­u­men­ta­tion process, in­clud­ing mo­bile health apps such as Com­monPass, ICC AOK­pass and Ver­iFLY, to en­sure trav­ellers can present their health data in a se­cure, ver­i­fi­able way.</p>
    <p>It’s not known yet whether some kind of uni­ver­sal health form or cer­tifi­cate will be re­quired to travel, be­cause that would need par­tic­i­pa­tion from var­i­ous coun­tries and or­gan­i­sa­tions, but that’s hap­pened be­fore.</p>
    <p>The In­ter­na­tional Cer­tifi­cate of Vac­ci­na­tion or Pro­phy­laxis, known as the carte jaune or yel­low card, was cre­ated in the mid-1930s by the World Health Or­gan­i­sa­tion. Ver­sions of it were used as proof of vac­ci­na­tion against dis­eases such as yel­low fever, ty­phus and small­pox, and many coun­tries still re­quire proof of cer­tain vac­ci­na­tions when trav­el­ling.</p>
    <p>To­day’s apps have to ad­dress a host of is­sues around car­ry­ing health data, in­clud­ing pri­vacy and stan­dard­i­s­a­tion. For one thing, no­body wants to carry around a printed health record that could con­tain sen­si­tive in­for­ma­tion, in ad­di­tion to proof of test­ing or vac­ci­na­tion. For an­other, such records could be forged with im­age-edit­ing tools. And in this in­creas­ingly global world, a trav­eller’s health doc­u­ments could be writ­ten in a lan­guage that is un­fa­mil­iar to an airport of­fi­cial.</p>
    <p>The Com­mons Project, the non-profit that is de­vel­op­ing the Com­monPass, has said that its app con­nects with web­sites for med­i­cal fa­cil­i­ties, and those sites then load ver­i­fi­ca­tion of the com­pleted test or vac­cine record into the app, lim­it­ing the amount of pri­vate in­for­ma­tion that is shared. Oth­ers are tak­ing a</p>
    <p>sim­i­lar ap­proach.</p>
    <p>A com­mon re­quest from peo­ple across the in­dus­try is for gov­ern­ments to work to­gether to stan­dard­ise test­ing and vac­ci­na­tion re­quire­ments. For ex­am­ple, trav­ellers who are vac­ci­nated in the United States should know that their vac­ci­na­tion and doc­u­men­ta­tion will be valid in Thai­land and vice versa.</p>
    <p>HOW LONG MUST I WAIT UN­TIL TRAVEL PICKS UP?</p>
    <p>With ap­proved vac­cines be­ing ad­min­is­tered in Bri­tain, Canada, the US and else­where, in­dus­try in­sid­ers are hope­ful that peo­ple will tran­si­tion from search­ing for trips on­line to book­ing them.</p>
    <p>“A safe, ef­fec­tive and well-dis­trib­uted coro­n­avirus vac­cine is the linch­pin for a return to travel nor­malcy,” Mr Scott Keyes, founder of Scott’s Cheap Flights, an on­line book­ing plat­form, wrote in a re­cent e-mail. “Great news on the vac­cine front is great news on the travel front.”</p>
    <p>But the ini­tial dis­tri­bu­tion of the vac­cines may not equal a swift return to mass travel. While some ex­perts be­lieve that pent-up de­mand will have peo­ple rush­ing in large num­bers to book “vaxi­ca­tions”, oth­ers, in­clud­ing Dr An­thony Fauci, the US’ top in­fec­tious dis­ease ex­pert, think the return to travel will be grad­ual.</p>
    <p>Un­til Covid-19 vac­cines are widely dis­trib­uted, rig­or­ous test­ing will re­main a key part of the travel ex­pe­ri­ence – be­fore and after trav­el­ling. (Ex­pect test­ing to be of­fered as an amenity at a grow­ing num­ber of ho­tels.)</p>
    <p>Mean­while, cruise lines are re­port­ing strong book­ings for next sum­mer, and air­line travel is ex­pected to pick up in the sec­ond quar­ter of next year, with in­ter­na­tional travel out­pac­ing do­mes­tic trips, ac­cord­ing to travel mar­ket­ing firm MMGY Global, a sig­nif­i­cant change from book­ings for this year.</p>
    <p>WHEN WILL I BE TRAV­EL­LING FOR BUSI­NESS AGAIN?</p>
    <p>AND WHAT ABOUT MY FRE­QUENT FLIER MILES?</p>
    <p>This was the year busi­ness travel flat­lined, tak­ing with it air­line, ho­tel and con­ven­tion hall prof­itabil­ity. For a time, it also jeop­ar­dised those loy­alty point bal­ances cov­eted as free­bie cur­rency by fre­quent busi­ness trav­ellers and many oth­ers, as miles and credit card points seemed less valu­able when no one was trav­el­ling.</p>
    <p>But point pro­grammes are far from dead, ex­perts say, cit­ing bet­ter book­ing terms, the grow­ing value of loyal cus­tomers to travel com­pa­nies and the ad­vent of creative pro­grammes that may</p>
    <p>al­low you to spend points more eas­ily on things other than air­line tick­ets or mag­a­zine sub­scrip­tions. In these largely sta­tion­ary times, such pro­grammes are keen to re­tain ex­ist­ing mem­bers.</p>
    <p>Most an­a­lysts ex­pect any near-term travel re­cov­ery to be driven by leisure trav­ellers des­per­ate for a va­ca­tion or to see fam­ily, not by busi­ness fliers.</p>
    <p>Apart from health con­cerns and cor­po­rate travel freezes, “busi­ness trav­ellers need a place to go to and cur­rently of­fice oc­cu­pan­cies are very, very low, so there is no real rea­son to travel to a city”, said Mr Jan Fre­itag, na­tional direc­tor of hospi­tal­ity market an­a­lyt­ics at CoStar Group, a com­mer­cial real es­tate firm, point­ing to data that shows of­fice oc­cu­pancy av­er­ag­ing around 24 per cent na­tion­ally in the US.</p>
    <p>He ex­pects busi­ness travel to pick up in the third quar­ter of next year, while con­sul­tancy firm McKin­sey pins the full re­cov­ery to 2023 or beyond.</p>
    <p>IF I NEED TO CAN­CEL, WILL FLEX­I­BLE POLI­CIES STILL BE AROUND?</p>
    <p>As the coro­n­avirus crisis crushed travel, flex­i­bil­ity swept the in­dus­try, from air­lines to cruises to recre­ational ve­hi­cle rentals and ho­tels, as oper­a­tors aimed to as­sure po­ten­tial trav­ellers they had lit­tle to lose – fi­nan­cially, any­way – in book­ing.</p>
    <p>Air­lines came a long way in bend­ing to con­sumer sen­ti­ment, of­fer­ing fee-free changes even on non-re­fund­able tick­ets as pas­sen­ger vol­umes plum­meted; they re­main down nearly 70 per cent com­pared with a year ago.</p>
    <p>Also, air­lines have talked about mak­ing flex­i­bil­ity per­ma­nent for other fares, a prom­ise that may hold out un­til the in­dus­try re­cov­ers to last year’s lev­els, which in­dus­try group Air­lines for Amer­ica doesn’t ex­pect be­fore 2023 or 2024.</p>
    <p>While ho­tels have long had flex­i­ble can­cel­la­tion con­di­tions, usu­ally al­low­ing penalty-free can­cel­la­tions a day be­fore ar­rival, con­sumers this year dis­cov­ered – of­ten the hard way – the vari­able terms of va­ca­tion ren­tal homes, which can range from re­fund­able 24 hours out to re­fund­able only within 48 hours of book­ing.</p>
    <p>“Can­cel­la­tion poli­cies in the va­ca­tion ren­tal market have not changed,” said Mr Clark Twiddy, pres­i­dent of Twiddy & Com­pany, which man­ages more than 1,000 va­ca­tion home rentals on the</p>
    <p>Outer Banks in North Carolina.</p>
    <p>“But we’ve seen a sig­nif­i­cant up­take in travel in­sur­ance,” he added, not­ing in­creases of up to 40 per cent.</p>
    <p>Airbnb has an­nounced it is work­ing on se­cur­ing a travel in­sur­ance part­ner to make it easy to in­sure book­ings.</p>
    <p>I’D LIKE TO TRAVEL WITH MY FAM­ILY, WHAT’S THE OUT­LOOK?</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to an Oc­to­ber sur­vey by Vrbo, the home-ren­tal com­pany, 82 per cent of US fam­i­lies al­ready have travel plans for next year. Sixty-five per cent plan on trav­el­ling more than they did be­fore Covid-19; 61 per cent will most likely choose out­doorsy des­ti­na­tions over ur­ban ones.</p>
    <p>But most no­table this year for fam­i­lies was the loss of, or pause in, multi-gen­er­a­tional trips.</p>
    <p>“In­ter-gen­er­a­tional travel – go­ing some­place with grand­par­ents – is kind of off the books for a while,” said Ms Mar­i­anne Perez de Fran­sius, co-founder and chief ex­ec­u­tive of Bebe Voy­age, a fam­ily travel web­site and on­line com­mu­nity of glo­be­trot­ting par­ents. “What peo­ple are talk­ing about is go­ing to visit grand­par­ents, be­cause they haven’t been able to do that.”</p>
    <p>Other pat­terns that cropped up this year will most likely con­tinue to de­fine fam­ily travel next year, in­clud­ing “school­ca­tions” that have trans­ported mid­dle-school Zoom classes to the beach and multi-fam­ily “pod” trips that have al­lowed for in­ter-house­hold so­cial­is­ing some­where – any­where – be­sides home.</p>
    <p>But there is one big, unan­swered ques­tion: vac­ci­na­tions for chil­dren. None of the coro­n­avirus vac­cines has been tested on kids, and while in­oc­u­la­tions are be­ing rolled out for older peo­ple first, it’s un­clear when they will reach chil­dren.</p>
    <p>“If kids can’t get the vac­cine, one con­cern I’ve heard is about what hap­pens with tourists,” said Ms Perez de Fran­sius. “Are coun­tries go­ing to say, ‘You can’t come in un­less ev­ery­one is vac­ci­nated’?”</p>
    <p>WHAT NEW TRAVEL TRENDS CAN I EX­PECT TO CON­TINUE IN 2021?</p>
    <p>Call them work­ca­tions, flex­ca­tions, bleisure, what­ever. No mat­ter the name, the longer trips that re­mote work­ing fa­cil­i­tated this year show no signs of slow­ing.</p>
    <p>“Global no­madism is go­ing to be a huge theme in 2021,” said Mr Jack Ezon, the founder of Em­bark Beyond, a luxury travel agency. “Peo­ple are go­ing to a des­ti­na­tion for a month be­cause they can work and play at the same time.”</p>
    <p>Stays of seven or more nights cur­rently ac­count for 17.5 per cent of the book­ings for next month at The Betsy Ho­tel in Mi­ami Beach, which re­opened in the mid­dle of this month for the first time since March. In Jan­uary, stays of that length to­talled 8.3 per cent.</p>
    <p>Mr Jonathan Plutzik, The Betsy’s owner, said: “Fam­i­lies with young chil­dren are look­ing for space: out­door spa­ces to be with their kids and space to work re­motely. Fifty- and 60-some­things are look­ing for those things, plus a full-ser­vice staff and places to dine and re­lax out­side.”</p>
    <p>Un­til vac­ci­na­tions are widespread, other pat­terns will also per­sist. Ever-chang­ing travel re­stric­tions will con­tinue to make stay­ca­tions and lo­cal travel among the few op­tions for those look­ing to get away.</p>
    <p>WILL I EVER FEEL SAFE TRAV­EL­LING?</p>
    <p>In the months since the pan­demic took hold, peo­ple across the travel in­dus­try have been work­ing to cre­ate poli­cies and pro­ce­dures that can ap­ply in times of fu­ture crisis – even if that fu­ture crisis isn’t a health crisis. Many com­pa­nies will use these changes, par­tic­u­larly in health and safety mea­sures, to woo trav­ellers back next year.</p>
    <p>For ho­tels and home shar­ing, per­haps the most vis­i­ble change is the em­pha­sis on clean­li­ness. Peo­ple have learnt to deeply care about the hy­giene of spa­ces with heavy traf­fic, like ho­tels, planes and trains, and will de­mand a stepped-up fo­cus on health mea­sures.</p>
    <p>This ap­proach is largely meant to put trav­ellers at ease. Des­ig­na­tions and rank­ing systems that take clean­li­ness and safety into ac­count could be­come the norm in the hospi­tal­ity in­dus­try. Part­ner­ships with trusted clean­ing-sup­ply brands or hos­pi­tals will con­tinue to evolve and be mar­keted to would-be trav­ellers. Am­trak touts its re­la­tion­ship with RB, the mak­ers of Lysol.</p>
    <p>Beyond clean­li­ness and health mea­sures, trav­ellers’ fears could be as­suaged by clearer com­mu­ni­ca­tion, flex­i­ble can­cel­la­tion and reschedul­ing poli­cies, and bet­ter use of tech­nol­ogy dur­ing ev­ery as­pect of the travel ex­pe­ri­ence.</p>
    <p>Mr Hus­sein Fazal and Mr Henry Shi, the founders of SnapTravel, an app that uses ar­ti­fi­cial in­tel­li­gence to help cus­tomers book ho­tels with mes­sag­ing apps like Face­book Mes­sen­ger and iMes­sage, have said that to adapt to the “new world”, they made tweaks to fo­cus more on spon­ta­neous book­ings and en­cour­age hes­i­tant cus­tomers to chat with a live agent.</p>
    <p>They added Covid-19 mes­sag­ing and no­ti­fi­ca­tions through­out the process. This al­lowed SnapTravel to see growth through­out the year, while also eas­ing trav­eller fears, and these changes would work in the event of other un­prece­dented crises.</p>
