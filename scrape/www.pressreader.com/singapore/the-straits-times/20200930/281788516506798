    <p>WASH­ING­TON Public health of­fi­cials in the US could take heart at the end of the sum­mer. Even as the coro­n­avirus con­tin­ued to spread, fewer peo­ple were wind­ing up in the hos­pi­tal be­cause of Covid-19, and fewer were dy­ing.</p>
    <p>But now, as the sea­sons turn, there are signs sug­gest­ing there will be more deaths and se­ri­ous ill­ness ahead. Data col­lected by the Covid Track­ing Pro­ject shows the num­ber of peo­ple hos­pi­talised has plateaued at about 30,000 in the past week, after a fall from nearly 60,000 that be­gan in late July.</p>
    <p>Deaths, mean­while, av­er­aged about 750 over the seven days through Sunday, higher than the roughly 600 deaths a day in the first week of July.</p>
    <p>Sci­en­tists had hoped that a warm-weather re­prieve could soften an ex­pected re-emer­gence of the coro­n­avirus in the colder months. In­stead, the con­ta­gion con­tin­ued to spread across the coun­try after Memo­rial Day, with early sum­mer out­breaks in Sun Belt states fol­lowed by the re­cent</p>
    <p>surge in the Up­per Mid­west and on col­lege cam­puses na­tion­wide.</p>
    <p>History and science sug­gest the se­cond win­ter with coro­n­avirus is likely to be worse than the first.</p>
    <p>“We haven’t had ex­po­sure to Covid through­out an en­tire win­ter, when more peo­ple are in­doors and close to­gether for pro­longed pe­ri­ods,” said Dr Wil­liam Schaffner, an in­fec­tious dis­ease pro­fes­sor at Van­der­bilt Univer­sity in Nashville, Ten­nessee. “We are cer­tainly con­cerned that Covid could spread even more read­ily in the win­ter than it has so far.”</p>
    <p>The Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion has pointed to the in­creas­ing avail­abil­ity of coro­n­avirus tests as the rea­son the num­ber of new cases in the United States re­mains high.</p>
    <p>In­creased test­ing has also made it pos­si­ble to catch coro­n­avirus cases ear­lier. That, com­bined with im­proved hos­pi­tal care and medicines like Gilead Sciences’ remde­sivir and generic steroid dex­am­etha­sone, al­lowed more pa­tients to sur­vive their in­fec­tions this sum­mer.</p>
    <p>How­ever, a week-long plateau in new cases, hos­pi­tal­i­sa­tions and deaths are an early warn­ing that things could be about to get worse.</p>
    <p>Along with the re­sump­tion of school, more states are eas­ing curbs on restau­rants and bars, giv­ing the virus more chances to find vul­ner­a­ble peo­ple to in­fect.</p>
    <p>States that had been do­ing well, in­clud­ing New York, are see­ing a new surge. New York Gov­er­nor An­drew Cuomo said there were 868 new cases on Sunday, an 18 per cent in­crease from two weeks ear­lier. Also, the per­cent­age of Covid-19 tests taken in New York state that has come back pos­i­tive has inched up to 1.5 per cent, Mr Cuomo said on Mon­day, a wor­ri­some trend for the for­mer epi­cen­tre of the coun­try’s coro­n­avirus epi­demic. New York’s pos­i­tiv­ity rate had hov­ered around 1 per cent for weeks, a hard-won met­ric after the state tal­lied thou­sands of cases per day dur­ing the peak of its out­break in the spring.</p>
    <p>Coun­try-wide, the num­ber of new cases has risen for two weeks in a row in 27 out of 50 states, with North Carolina and New Mex­ico re­port­ing in­creases above 50 per cent last week.</p>
    <p>Sep­a­rately, the US Cen­tres for Dis­ease Con­trol and Pre­ven­tion re­leased de­tailed data on Mon­day that showed al­most 280,000 chil­dren of school-go­ing age were in­fected with the coro­n­avirus be­tween March 1 and Sept 19.</p>
    <p>The fig­ure ac­counted for roughly 4 per cent of the to­tal US caseload over this pe­riod, with chil­dren aged 12-17 ap­prox­i­mately twice as likely to be in­fected as those aged 5-11.</p>
