    <p>Are you bored of Covid-19 con­straints and look­ing for some­thing novel to do?</p>
    <p>What about pound­ing the streets of Sin­ga­pore to learn more about our his­tory?</p>
    <p>There is a va­ri­ety of her­itage walks and tours avail­able, some of which are free.</p>
    <p>You can opt for a knowl­edge­able guide or ex­plore neigh­bour­hoods on your own.</p>
    <p>You may dis­cover, like I did, that ob­jects that have al­ways been there – sit­ting in cor­ners or stand­ing in plain sight – may have cul­tural sig­nif­i­cance.</p>
    <p>The mas­sive stone sculp­ture on the lawn in front of the Na­tional Mu­seum of Sin­ga­pore, for in­stance, is not only no­table for look­ing like domi­noes played by giants. It was made by a woman sculp­tor, Cul­tural Medal­lion re­cip­i­ent Han Sai Por.</p>
    <p>I learn about the piece, called 20 Tonnes, from her­itage guide May Hui, 66, on a fem­i­nist walk­ing trail co-or­gan­ised by the Sin­ga­pore Coun­cil of Women’s Or­gan­i­sa­tions.</p>
    <p>There are the­matic trails as well, such as those ar­ranged by ge­o­graph­i­cal precincts, or those re­volv­ing around our tra­di­tional food.</p>
    <p>Be warned, though. Old pho­to­graphs of kam­pungs, where Hous­ing Board flats now stand, are great for nostal­gia. But it takes imag­i­na­tion to see what used to be, with only bare bones in situ. See­ing a mod­ern pre-school on a on­ceim­por­tant his­tor­i­cal site can be a bit of a downer.</p>
    <p>This is where a his­to­rian racon­teur comes into his own.</p>
    <p>A guide with a zeal for re­search can show you how things used to be, just by telling a won­der­ful story. You can even close your eyes and en­ter a long-gone world.</p>
