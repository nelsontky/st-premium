    <p>A 22-year-old Rus­sian man ha­rassed flat oc­cu­pants on be­half of a loan shark to whom he owed money, and even gave him ac­cess to his own bank ac­count.</p>
    <p>Vladimir Danilenko, who is a diploma stu­dent in Sin­ga­pore, was jailed on Thurs­day for 14 months and fined $30,000. Court doc­u­ments did not state which school or course he was at­tend­ing.</p>
    <p>Danilenko had pleaded guilty to two charges of loan-shark ha­rass­ment and one count of as­sist­ing a loan shark to carry out the busi­ness of mon­eylend­ing.</p>
    <p>Seven other charges for loan­shark ha­rass­ment were taken into con­sid­er­a­tion by the court dur­ing sen­tenc­ing.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to court doc­u­ments,</p>
    <p>Danilenko bor­rowed $400 from a loan shark known as Bro in Novem­ber last year but was un­able to re­pay the loan.</p>
    <p>Bro then of­fered Danilenko work to ha­rass other debtors on his be­half. Danilenko ini­tially agreed but later failed to do so.</p>
    <p>In De­cem­ber last year, the loan shark of­fered Danilenko $150 in ex­change for his ATM card and his cor­re­spond­ing per­sonal iden­ti­fi­ca­tion num­ber (PIN).</p>
    <p>The stu­dent then left his ATM card and de­tails of his PIN above a set of let­ter­boxes at a hous­ing es­tate in Sengkang East Av­enue.</p>
    <p>Deputy Pub­lic Pros­e­cu­tor Kathy Chu said a run­ner work­ing for Bro gained ac­cess to Danilenko’s bank ac­count us­ing the ATM card and PIN.</p>
    <p>“The bank state­ment of the ac­cused’s DBS ac­count showed that at least $28,900 was de­posited and with­drawn from Dec 28, 2019, to Jan 20, 2020,” said the DPP.</p>
    <p>Bro con­tacted Danilenko again in February this year, of­fer­ing to pay him $150 to $300 for each flat that he splashed paint on and at which he left a debtor’s note as a mes­sage from the loan shark.</p>
    <p>Danilenko then roped in Kodagoda Dul­shan Kavinda, a 24-year-old Sri Lankan na­tional, for as­sis­tance.</p>
    <p>On Feb 6, at 1.34am, the duo went to a flat in Jalan Bukit Merah, where Danilenko splashed paint at the unit, in­clud­ing on its front door and gate, and left a note about a pur­ported loan.</p>
    <p>He re­peated his ac­tions five days later at a flat in Wood­lands Av­enue 1.</p>
    <p>On both oc­ca­sions, Kavinda recorded the acts us­ing Danilenko’s mo­bile phone, as proof to Bro that they had done as he had asked.</p>
    <p>The Sri Lankan na­tional was sen­tenced to 10 months’ jail on Sept 21 for his in­volve­ment in the ha­rass­ment acts.</p>
    <p>On Thurs­day, Danilenko’s lawyer Kalaithasa­n Karup­paya said that his client would not be able to pay the fine. Danilenko will there­fore serve an ad­di­tional four weeks in jail in­stead.</p>
