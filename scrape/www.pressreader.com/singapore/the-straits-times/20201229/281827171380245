    <p>• The 63-year-old sus­pect in the bomb­ing that rocked Nashville on Christ­mas morn­ing was killed in the blast that de­stroyed his mo­tor home and dam­aged more than 40 busi­nesses, the au­thor­i­ties have said.</p>
    <p>Foren­sic ex­perts from the Fed­eral Bureau of In­ves­ti­ga­tion (FBI) matched DNA sam­ples re­cov­ered from the scene to that of An­thony Warner, whose home in nearby An­ti­och was searched last Satur­day by fed­eral agents.</p>
    <p>Late on Sun­day, the FBI tweeted a photo of Warner. “We’ve come to the con­clu­sion that an in­di­vid­ual named An­thony Warner is the bomber and he was present when the bomb went off and that he per­ished in the bomb­ing,” Mr Don­ald Cochran, US At­tor­ney for the Mid­dle District of Ten­nessee, told a news con­fer­ence.</p>
    <p>Of­fi­cials said it was too early in the in­ves­ti­ga­tion to dis­cuss the sus­pect’s mo­tives.</p>
    <p>Warner’s mo­tor home, parked on a down­town street of Ten­nessee’s largest city, ex­ploded at dawn on Fri­day, mo­ments after po­lice re­spond­ing to re­ports of gun­fire no­ticed it and heard mu­sic and an au­to­mated mes­sage em­a­nat­ing from the ve­hi­cle warning of a bomb.</p>
    <p>The ex­plo­sion in the heart of Amer­ica’s coun­try mu­sic cap­i­tal in­jured three peo­ple and dam­aged busi­nesses in­clud­ing an AT&T switch­ing cen­tre. It also dis­rupted mo­bile, In­ter­net and TV ser­vices in cen­tral Ten­nessee and parts of four other states.</p>
    <p>As in­ves­ti­ga­tors fol­lowed up on hun­dreds of tips from mem­bers of the pub­lic, they searched Warner’s home last Satur­day and vis­ited a Nashville real es­tate agency where he had worked on com­put­ers.</p>
    <p>The owner of Fridrich & Clark Realty, Mr Steve Fridrich, told The Ten­nessean news­pa­per that for four or five years, Warner had come into the of­fice roughly once a month to pro­vide com­puter con­sult­ing ser­vices, un­til this month when he told the firm in an e-mail he would no longer be work­ing for it.</p>
    <p>He gave no rea­son, ac­cord­ing to Mr Fridrich. “He seemed very per­son­able to us – this is quite out of char­ac­ter I think,” Mr Fridrich told the news­pa­per.</p>
    <p>Nashville Mayor John Cooper said on CBS News’ Face The Na­tion pro­gramme on Sun­day that lo­cal of­fi­cials felt there had to be some con­nec­tion be­tween the bomb­ing and the AT&T build­ing.</p>
    <p>Dam­age to the switch­ing cen­tre was so ex­ten­sive that AT&T teams had to drill ac­cess holes into the wreck­age to con­nect gen­er­a­tors to crit­i­cal equip­ment, as well as pump wa­ter from the base­ment. The com­pany said in a state­ment on Sun­day that it made “sig­nif­i­cant progress” overnight and had re­stored power to four floors of the build­ing.</p>
    <p>AT&T said it was aim­ing to re­store all its wire­less ser­vice by the end of Sun­day. “As of now, 96 per cent of our wire­less net­work is re­stored, 60 per cent of our busi­ness ser­vices are re­stored, and 86 per cent of our con­sumer broad­band and en­ter­tain­ment ser­vices are re­stored,” AT&T com­mu­ni­ca­tions chief ex­ec­u­tive Jeff McEl­fresh said.</p>
