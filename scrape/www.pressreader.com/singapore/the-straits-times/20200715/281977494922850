    <p>WELLING­TON • New Zealand’s main op­po­si­tion party, trail­ing in the opin­ion polls ahead of Septem­ber’s elec­tion, yes­ter­day elected Ms Ju­dith Collins as leader af­ter the sur­prise res­ig­na­tion of Mr Todd Muller, who held the job for less than two months.</p>
    <p>Ms Collins, 61, was cho­sen by the party’s cau­cus in an evening vote.</p>
    <p>Nick­named “Crusher” be­cause of her rep­u­ta­tion as a hard-fight­ing politi­cian, she said she hopes her Na­tional Party will “col­lec­tively crush the gov­ern­ment” at the elec­tion, Stuff.co.nz re­ported.</p>
    <p>Ms Collins will face Prime Min­is­ter Jacinda Ardern in the Septem­ber vote, the sec­ond time that women have led the coun­try’s two main par­ties into an elec­tion.</p>
    <p>Mr Muller, like his pre­de­ces­sor Si­mon Bridges, strug­gled to turn the tide against Ms Ardern, who has won plau­dits at home and abroad for her han­dling of the coro­n­avirus out­break, and her re­sponse to the 2019 Christchur­ch mas­sacre.</p>
    <p>Ms Collins has been in Par­lia­ment since 2002 and was a min­is­ter un­der the John Key-Bill English gov­ern­ment, var­i­ously over­see­ing port­fo­lios in­clud­ing rev­enue, en­ergy, po­lice and jus­tice.</p>
    <p>Mr Muller cited the “heavy toll” the job had taken on him and his fam­ily, though his ten­ure in­cluded a se­ries of mis­steps, in­clud­ing a leak con­cern­ing Covid-19 pa­tients.</p>
    <p>“It has be­come clear to me that I am not the best per­son to be leader of the op­po­si­tion and leader of the New Zealand Na­tional Party at this crit­i­cal time,” he said in a state­ment in Welling­ton yes­ter­day. “The role has taken a heavy toll on me per­son­ally, and on my fam­ily, and this has be­come un­ten­able from a health per­spec­tive.”</p>
    <p>Mr Muller took over Na­tional’s lead­er­ship on May 22, af­ter polls show­ing a slump in sup­port un­der his pre­de­ces­sor led to Mr Bridges’ oust­ing by the party’s Mem­bers of Par­lia­ment.</p>
    <p>In a One News/Col­mar Brun­ton poll pub­lished on June 25, Ms Ardern’s Labour Party had 50 per cent sup­port to Na­tional’s 38 per cent – sig­nalling the chal­lenge Mr Muller faced ahead of the Sept 19 elec­tion. Mr Muller scored 13 per cent as pre­ferred prime min­is­ter to Ms Ardern’s 43 per cent.</p>
    <p>Mr Muller was un­der pres­sure af­ter he took over the reins. His reshuf­fled shadow Cabi­net drew crit­i­cism for lack­ing eth­nic di­ver­sity and he was called out by some me­dia for not hav­ing a clear eco­nomic plan.</p>
