    <p>With its new pact with Nas­daq, the Sin­ga­pore Ex­change (SGX) has thrown its hat into the ring to at­tract list­ings from the world’s hottest sec­tor.</p>
    <p>But scep­ti­cism abounds over whether this strat­egy will suc­ceed.</p>
    <p>SGX on Tues­day said it will ex­tend its part­ner­ship with the US tech-fo­cused bourse to make doc­u­men­ta­tion eas­ier for firms seek­ing a sec­ond list­ing in Sin­ga­pore. The deal height­ens ri­valry with Hong Kong as the North Asia hub launches a tech in­dex for its 30 big­gest stocks, an­a­lysts said.</p>
    <p>“It re­mains to be seen if it will be a game-changer,” said DBS Bank an­a­lyst Lim Rui Wen, adding that there are sev­eral fac­tors, such as tar­get in­vestor base, costs and val­u­a­tions.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore has long been seen to have a sound le­gal and reg­u­la­tory frame­work, ben­e­fit­ing from sta­ble pol­i­tics. But SGX has suf­fered from a spate of delist­ings in re­cent years, a marked ab­sence of any big-ticket tech of­fer­ings, and was re­cently hurt by MSCI’s de­ci­sion to se­lect Hong Kong to li­cense some of its de­riv­a­tive prod­ucts.</p>
    <p>Be­sides of­fer­ing liq­uid­ity with sus­tain­able and grow­ing val­u­a­tions, SGX’s plat­form has helped listed firms raise four times more funds through the sec­ondary mar­ket than at ini­tial pub­lic of­fer­ings (IPOs) over the last five years, an SGX spokesman said in an e-mail.</p>
    <p>The SGX move comes as the United States ended Hong Kong’s spe­cial sta­tus af­ter China im­posed a na­tional se­cu­rity law that curbs free­doms. Grow­ing dif­fi­culty for Chi­nese of­fer­ings in Amer­ica means those firms could be seek­ing a list­ing else­where.</p>
    <p>Here are sev­eral met­rics out­lined by an­a­lysts to gauge the com­pet­i­tive­ness of Sin­ga­pore’s eq­uity mar­ket for tech list­ings:</p>
    <p>VAL­U­A­TIONS</p>
    <p>Tech stocks in Sin­ga­pore are much cheaper than their peers in other mar­kets, with the sec­tor on av­er­age trad­ing at 14 times fore­cast earn­ings, com­pared with 40 times in Hong Kong and 76 times in the US.</p>
    <p>How­ever, fun­da­men­tally, val­u­a­tion is “more a func­tion of the com­pany, not the ex­change it is listed on”, Ms Lim said.</p>
    <p>LIQ­UID­ITY</p>
    <p>While av­er­age daily turnover in the past 60 days for stocks on Sin­ga­pore’s bench­mark Straits Times In­dex is about a sev­enth of the Hang Seng In­dex’s, their liq­uid­ity is bet­ter by an­other mea­sure. At 52.7 per cent, shares chang­ing hands as a per­cent­age of mar­ket value was higher for the Sin­ga­pore gauge for the year end­ing June 30.</p>
    <p>Still, Hong Kong is the world’s fourth-largest eq­uity mar­ket.</p>
    <p>An­a­lysts are di­vided on whether Sin­ga­pore’s mar­ket is deep enough to host large tech of­fer­ings.</p>
    <p>“Liq­uid­ity begets liq­uid­ity,” said Phillip Se­cu­ri­ties Sin­ga­pore head of re­search Paul Chew. “List­ing in Sin­ga­pore can pro­vide Nas­daq com­pa­nies an ad­di­tional layer of liq­uid­ity from af­ter-hours trad­ing.”</p>
    <p>Mr Justin Tang, head of Asian re­search at United First Part­ners, has an op­pos­ing view. “If a com­pany listed on the Nas­daq can­not find enough liq­uid­ity, it won’t find it on the SGX,” he said.</p>
    <p>The Nas­daq Com­pos­ite In­dex’s daily turnover is about 70 times that of the Straits Times In­dex.</p>
    <p>LIST­INGS</p>
    <p>Tech list­ings in Sin­ga­pore are over­shad­owed by its peers. There have been zero tech list­ings this year in the city-state, which is home to about 70 tech stocks in to­tal.</p>
    <p>In con­trast, Hong Kong – the busiest IPO venue in the world last year – has nine tech list­ings so far this year, tak­ing its to­tal tech stocks to more than 250.</p>
    <p>The US, home to heavy­weights such as Ap­ple and Mi­crosoft, has 19 new list­ings this year and in­cludes more than 670 such stocks.</p>
    <p>It “re­ally de­pends how SGX could con­vince emerg­ing tech­nol­ogy firms to list do­mes­ti­cally”, said Ms Mar­garet Yang, a strate­gist at Dai­lyFX.</p>
