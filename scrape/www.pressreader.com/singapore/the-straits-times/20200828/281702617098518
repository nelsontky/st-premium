    <p>Even as they spend sig­nif­i­cant re­sources on bat­tling the coro­n­avirus, the min­istries in charge of Sin­ga­pore’s se­cu­rity will press on with build­ing up ca­pa­bil­i­ties for the longer term, in­clud­ing tapping tech­nol­ogy and in­vest­ing in ser­vice­men.</p>
    <p>And while the wel­fare of Sin­ga­pore­ans over­seas con­tin­ues to be one of the pri­or­i­ties, strength­en­ing the coun­try’s ties with for­eign part­ners will main­tain crit­i­cal sup­ply links and se­cure ac­cess to Covid-19 vac­cines when they be­come avail­able.</p>
    <p>Th­ese pri­or­i­ties were out­lined by the min­istries of De­fence, Home and For­eign Af­fairs yes­ter­day in their ad­denda to the Pres­i­dent’s Ad­dress.</p>
    <p>The De­fence and Home Af­fairs min­istries pointed to sig­nif­i­cant threats and chal­lenges ahead, such as cy­ber at­tacks, ter­ror­ism, for­eign in­ter­fer­ence in do­mes­tic pol­i­tics, and transna­tional crimes.</p>
    <p>“The geopo­lit­i­cal en­vi­ron­ment and se­cu­rity land­scape which we face are be­com­ing more com­plex, and fur­ther ex­ac­er­bated by dis­rup­tions and dif­fer­ences brought about by the Covid-19 pan­demic,” said De­fence Min­is­ter Ng Eng Hen.</p>
    <p>The Sin­ga­pore Armed Forces has not com­pro­mised on op­er­a­tional readi­ness de­spite Covid-19, and has re­sumed more train­ing ac­tiv­i­ties, as well as restarted over­seas ex­er­cises to sharpen its ca­pa­bil­ity edge, he added.</p>
    <p>Look­ing ahead, the next-gen­er­a­tion SAF will make use of dig­i­tal­i­sa­tion, au­ton­o­mous and un­manned sys­tems, big data and ar­ti­fi­cial in­tel­li­gence, he said.</p>
    <p>But he stressed that na­tional ser­vice re­mains the cru­cial back­bone of Sin­ga­pore’s de­fence.</p>
    <p>The na­tional ser­vice sys­tem will be en­hanced to sup­port the needs of a new gen­er­a­tion of ser­vice­men, and the Na­tional Ser­vice Re­view Com­mit­tee es­tab­lished this year will look at ways to bet­ter match skills and ex­pe­ri­ence to vo­ca­tions and de­ploy­ment.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, Min­is­ter for Home Af­fairs K. Shan­mugam an­nounced that a Safe Travel Of­fice has been set up un­der the Im­mi­gra­tion and Check­points Au­thor­ity (ICA) to pro­vide “a sin­gle touch­point” for all trav­ellers. The move is prompted by the steps the Gov­ern­ment has been tak­ing to reopen Sin­ga­pore’s bor­ders.</p>
    <p>The of­fice, set up last month, will pro­vide co­or­di­na­tion across the agen­cies in­volved in var­i­ous travel schemes, and make for an eas­ier and smoother travel ex­pe­ri­ence, he said in his min­istry’s ad­den­dum.</p>
    <p>In re­sponse to me­dia queries, the ICA said a one-stop SafeTravel on­line ap­pli­ca­tion por­tal has been launched to fa­cil­i­tate trav­ellers’ en­try to and exit from Sin­ga­pore, while en­sur­ing pub­lic health con­sid­er­a­tions are ad­dressed.</p>
    <p>The por­tal will also au­to­mate travel ap­pli­ca­tions and process pub­lic in­quiries and ap­peals. Trav­ellers who wish to find out more about the re­quire­ments of the var­i­ous travel schemes can visit the por­tal at safetravel.ica.gov.sg</p>
    <p>The Home Af­fairs Min­istry will also strengthen ca­pa­bil­i­ties to deal with emerg­ing and evolv­ing threats. In terms of tech­nol­ogy, it will de­velop more dig­i­tal foren­sics ca­pa­bil­i­ties to tackle tech­nol­ogy crimes, and in­ten­sify the role of ro­bots and un­manned aerial ve­hi­cles in search-and-res­cue, fire­fight­ing and haz­ardous ma­te­ri­als op­er­a­tions.</p>
    <p>For­eign Min­is­ter Vivian Balakr­ish­nan, in his min­istry’s ad­den­dum, said the min­istry re­mains com­mit­ted to help­ing Sin­ga­pore­ans over­seas and do­ing its part to bring peace of mind to their fam­i­lies at home.</p>
    <p>Other than look­ing af­ter over­seas Sin­ga­pore­ans, it has two other pri­or­i­ties. One is to man­age and strengthen ties with immediate neigh­bours, Asean and key re­gional and in­ter­na­tional part­ners.</p>
    <p>The other is to main­tain Sin­ga­pore’s rel­e­vance on the global stage and en­gage in­ter­na­tional part­ners in the col­lec­tive fight against Covid-19.</p>
    <p>As the coun­try nav­i­gates the choppy wa­ters ahead, Dr Balakr­ish­nan called on Sin­ga­pore­ans to stay strong and united. “This will strengthen our cred­i­bil­ity when we work with ex­ter­nal part­ners to strengthen our bi­lat­eral re­la­tions, re­gional stand­ing and in­ter­na­tional pres­ence,” he said.</p>
    <p>While the wel­fare of Sin­ga­pore­ans over­seas con­tin­ues to be one of the pri­or­i­ties, strength­en­ing the coun­try’s ties with for­eign part­ners will main­tain crit­i­cal sup­ply links and se­cure ac­cess to Covid-19 vac­cines when they be­come avail­able.</p>
