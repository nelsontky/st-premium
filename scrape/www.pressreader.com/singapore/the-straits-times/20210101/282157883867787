    <p>A man ac­cused of Ms Feli­cia Teo Wei Ling’s mur­der in 2007 will be fur­ther re­manded, with his case ad­journed to next Thurs­day.</p>
    <p>A dis­trict court heard yes­ter­day that Ah­mad Da­nial Mo­hamed Rafa’ee, now 35, had been i n Changi Prison Com­plex Med­i­cal Cen­tre but details of his health con­di­tion were not men­tioned i n court.</p>
    <p>He is rep­re­sented by Mr Shashi Nathan, Ms Ta­nia Chin and Ms Laura Yeo from law firm Withers Khat­tarWong.</p>
    <p>Mr Nathan told the court that he is mak­ing ar­range­ments to meet his client at the Crim­i­nal In­ves­ti­ga­tion Depart­ment (CID).</p>
    <p>Ah­mad is ac­cused of mur­der­ing Ms Teo, 19, at a Marine Ter­race flat on June 30, 2007.</p>
    <p>The Sin­ga­porean is said to have com­mit­ted the of­fence with another man – Ragil Pu­tra Se­tia Suk­marah­jana, now 32.</p>
    <p>The two men are be­lieved to be friends of Ms Teo.</p>
    <p>There has been no up­date on the where­abouts of her re­mains and in­ves­ti­ga­tions sur­round­ing Ragil, who is said to be over­seas.</p>
    <p>Ms Teo’s dis­ap­pear­ance made head­lines when her fam­ily and friends ap­pealed for help.</p>
    <p>They re­fused to be­lieve that the teenager had run away.</p>
    <p>The last time they saw her was on June 29, 2007, when she left her home in the Bras Basah area.</p>
    <p>Closed-cir­cuit tele­vi­sion footage later showed her en­ter­ing a lift in a Marine Ter­race hous­ing block with two men.</p>
    <p>She has not been seen or heard from again.</p>
    <p>When she did not re­turn, her mother lodged a miss­ing per­sons po­lice re­port on July 3.</p>
    <p>Of­fi­cers be­gan in­ves­ti­gat­ing and they ini­tially clas­si­fied Ms Teo’s dis­ap­pear­ance as a miss­ing per­sons case.</p>
    <p>This was be­cause they did not find any facts link­ing the two men to her dis­ap­pear­ance.</p>
    <p>The men had ear­lier told of­fi­cers that Ms Teo left the flat of her own ac­cord.</p>
    <p>Her friends and fam­ily then con­ducted their own search and more than 200 peo­ple got in­volved.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, the po­lice con­tin­ued regularly re­view­ing the case.</p>
    <p>They got a break when the case was re­ferred to the CID in July last year and of­fi­cers un­cov­ered new leads.</p>
    <p>They ar­rested Ah­mad on Dec 15 and he was charged with mur­der in a dis­trict court two days later.</p>
    <p>Of­fend­ers con­victed of mur­der will face the death sen­tence.</p>
