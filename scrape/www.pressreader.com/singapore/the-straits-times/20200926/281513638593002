    <p>Thai youth’s frus­tra­tion over what they be­lieve is an un­fair and rot­ten po­lit­i­cal sys­tem is boil­ing over into street protests at a time when two crit­i­cal safety buf­fers of the past are gone, says Pro­fes­sor Thiti­nan Pong­sud­hi­rak.</p>
    <p>Thai­land is caught up once again in the throes of street protests.</p>
    <p>Un­like the colour-coded street demon­stra­tions be­tween con­ser­va­tive-roy­al­ist “yel­low” shirts and their “red-clad” ri­vals aligned with ousted premier Thaksin Shi­nawa­tra nearly 20 years ago, this time it is the coun­try’s young peo­ple – Gen Z and late mil­len­ni­als – who are driv­ing this new wave of con­fronta­tion be­tween the forces of con­ser­vatism and change.</p>
    <p>At first sight, it ap­pears to be a painful blast from the past, but Thai­land’s po­lit­i­cal drama looks to be in its penul­ti­mate act, head­ing for its fi­nal reck­on­ing.</p>
    <p>At is­sue is whether the ma­jor­ity in Thai­land get to have their say through a fairly con­structed elec­toral sys­tem or the mi­nor­ity con­tin­ues to rig the rules to over­turn or ma­nip­u­late elected re­sults, thereby main­tain­ing their power and up­per hand.</p>
    <p>Un­like the Red Shirts, who took to the streets years ago in a bid to re­claim their vot­ing rights when their pre­ferred po­lit­i­cal par­ties were dis­solved, Thai­land’s young pro­test­ers want to restart the po­lit­i­cal process for a new, fairer demo­cratic sys­tem.</p>
    <p>One of their key de­mands is the rewrit­ing of a Con­sti­tu­tion that is built to favour the mil­i­tary’s con­tin­ued grip on power.</p>
    <p>To the pro­test­ers, those who rule should de­rive le­git­i­macy from elected rep­re­sen­ta­tives with pub­lic ac­count­abil­ity rather than hide be­hind a crooked char­ter that caters to con­ser­va­tive-roy­al­ist in­ter­ests and pref­er­ences.</p>
    <p>THE AWAK­EN­ING</p>
    <p>It took some time for th­ese young Thais to rise up. Mostly in their teens and 20s, they were born well af­ter the Cold War decades when Thai­land’s po­lit­i­cal or­der was forged and built around three key pil­lars – the mil­i­tary, the monar­chy and the ju­di­ciary and bu­reau­cratic es­tab­lish­ment.</p>
    <p>To Thai­land’s frus­trated youth, the old ed­i­fice held up by th­ese three pil­lars is badly in need of change. Th­ese fresh faces in Thai pol­i­tics are sick and tired of the back-and-forth mil­i­tary and ju­di­cial in­ter­ven­tions al­ter­nat­ing with coups, re­vised con­sti­tu­tions, and elec­tions that bring no mean­ing­ful change.</p>
    <p>The stu­dent gen­er­a­tion is now chal­leng­ing the sta­tus quo right down to its foun­da­tions, de­mand­ing re­forms even of the once-un­touch­able monar­chy to be­come more trans­par­ent and ac­count­able, and for the en­tire po­lit­i­cal sys­tem to be an­swer­able to the pop­u­lar will.</p>
    <p>When Mr Thaksin’s po­lit­i­cal party ma­chine swept to power in Jan­uary 2001 and won a land­slide re-elec­tion in Fe­bru­ary 2005, only to be over­thrown in a mil­i­tary coup in Septem­ber 2006, many of to­day’s pro­test­ers were in pri­mary school. They were too young to un­der­stand the tu­mult of the “yel­low ver­sus red” street demon­stra­tions that arose from the ju­di­cial ac­tivism which up­ended two Thaksin-aligned po­lit­i­cal par­ties in 2007 and 2008.</p>
    <p>But when a putsch took place in May 2014 to dis­lodge yet an­other Thaksin proxy gov­ern­ment, which was spear­headed by his sis­ter Yingluck Shi­nawa­tra, Thai mil­len­ni­als be­gan to pay at­ten­tion.</p>
    <p>The younger gen­er­a­tion and oth­ers who were tired of end­less protests ini­tially gave a chance to the gov­ern­ment of Gen­eral Prayut Chan-o-cha, the coup leader and now the Prime Min­is­ter. But five years af­ter it seized power, the Prayut-led mil­i­tary gov­ern­ment turned back the clock on Thai­land’s econ­omy and pol­i­tics.</p>
    <p>GROW­ING FRUS­TRA­TION</p>
    <p>An­nual growth in Thai­land has slowed from around 5 per cent in the 2001-to-2006 pe­riod to 3 per cent in the pe­riod from 2014 to last year. The Thai econ­omy was al­ready fal­ter­ing long be­fore Covid-19, fall­ing be­hind re­gional peers such as Viet­nam.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to a World Bank re­port pub­lished be­fore the pan­demic, Thai­land needs to sus­tain growth rates above 5 per cent to hit its tar­get of be­com­ing a high-in­come coun­try by 2037.</p>
    <p>Ed­u­ca­tion re­forms are im­per­a­tive, but are ne­glected. Thai­land’s schools and uni­ver­si­ties rank be­low their global peers, and re­search spend­ing is in­ad­e­quate. English lan­guage skills, so crit­i­cal for the dig­i­tal econ­omy, ap­pear to be slid­ing, with Thai­land now placed 74th out of 100 coun­tries in one pro­fi­ciency rank­ing, ac­cord­ing to a Bloomberg re­port.</p>
    <p>The econ­omy needs res­cu­ing too, but in­stead, the Prayut gov­ern­ment in­curred a bud­get deficit each year in of­fice, ac­cu­mu­lat­ing more than two tril­lion baht (S$87.1 bil­lion) in pub­lic debt to reach the le­gal ceil­ing of 60 per cent of gross do­mes­tic prod­uct.</p>
    <p>The few junta-ap­pointed tech­nocrats also failed to fol­low through on plans be­hind the Thai­land 4.0 and East­ern</p>
    <p>Eco­nomic Cor­ri­dor eco­nomic growth strate­gies.</p>
    <p>Be­yond eco­nomic mis­man­age­ment and a re­pres­sive po­lit­i­cal sys­tem dogged by charges of cor­rup­tion and nepo­tism, the rul­ing gen­er­als’ worst crime in the eyes of pro­test­ers was their role in doc­tor­ing, through prox­ies, the 2017 Con­sti­tu­tion that gave the mil­i­tary a one-third par­lia­men­tary quota, en­sur­ing their in­flu­ence and con­trol over Thai pol­i­tics for the fore­see­able fu­ture.</p>
    <p>Yet the stu­dents went along un­til the elec­tion in March last year. Some 13.7 per cent of el­i­gi­ble vot­ers in that elec­tion com­prised first-timers. When their pre­ferred Fu­ture For­ward Party un­der third-largest elec­tion win­ner Thanathorn Juan­groon­gru­angkit was hastily dis­solved in Fe­bru­ary, young Thais had had enough. Their pa­tience with the junta’s five years of ab­so­lute power was at an end.</p>
    <p>In­stan­ta­neous flash mobs mush­roomed on cam­puses na­tion­wide. Paused for a while by the pan­demic, the protests have re­turned with greater vir­u­lence, snow­balling and spilling into open street protests.</p>
    <p>A rally last weekend drew about 30,000 peo­ple – the largest demon­stra­tion since the 2014 coup.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, a de­ci­sion by Par­lia­ment to de­lay pos­si­ble changes to the Con­sti­tu­tion pro­voked more fury among pro­test­ers.</p>
    <p>It is tempt­ing to write off Thai­land’s new protests and dis­sent among its young pop­u­la­tion. The Prayut gov­ern­ment has mil­i­tary back­ing and par­lia­men­tary con­trol. Street protests in the re­cent past never ef­fected po­lit­i­cal change with­out mil­i­tary or ju­di­cial in­ter­ven­tion.</p>
    <p>NO BACKSTOP</p>
    <p>But Thai­land’s po­lit­i­cal en­vi­ron­ment to­day is pro­foundly dif­fer­ent on two fronts.</p>
    <p>First, through past coups and crises since the 1950s, the Thai econ­omy was ex­pand­ing briskly, by more than 6 per cent a year in the pe­riod from 1960 to 1997. This time, how­ever, partly be­cause of Covid-19, it is fac­ing its worst con­trac­tion, even com­pared with 1997 to 1998, when Thai­land was the epi­cen­tre of the Asian fi­nan­cial cri­sis.</p>
    <p>Sec­ond, when push came to shove in the past, the late King Bhu­mi­bol Adulyadej was able to re­store unity and sta­bil­ity be­cause of his moral author­ity and the great re­spect ac­corded to him by the Thai peo­ple for the tire­less ef­forts he had ex­pended in his long reign to bring de­vel­op­ment to the poorer parts of the coun­try. With his death goes the unique role of ar­biter in times of trou­ble.</p>
    <p>As the youth move­ment gath­ers strength, Thai­land’s sta­tus quo has be­come un­ten­able, while its tra­di­tional back­stops are no longer avail­able.</p>
    <p>THE OUT­LOOK</p>
    <p>What be­comes of the stu­dent protest move­ment de­pends on its abil­ity to broaden its reach to other seg­ments of Thai so­ci­ety that share sim­i­lar griev­ances and its re­form agenda. Some Red Shirts have joined causes with the stu­dents, and oth­ers who suf­fer on­go­ing eco­nomic hard­ship will be tempted to throw in their lot with them.</p>
    <p>But for now, the over­all num­bers have yet to hit the crit­i­cal six-digit mass, and will not do so un­less the stu­dent lead­ers can jointly come up with a broader agenda of in­sti­tu­tional re­forms, not just ones aimed at the monar­chy.</p>
    <p>As it stands, the youth move­ment for po­lit­i­cal change is dom­i­nated by a rad­i­cal wing bent on pri­mar­ily tak­ing the monarch and monar­chy to task.</p>
    <p>The more ap­peal­ing ap­proach that would win over older Thais, and not just mil­len­ni­als, is to ad­dress the rot in Thai­land’s in­sti­tu­tional ap­pa­ra­tus, from the mil­i­tary’s nepo­tism and opaque bud­get to cor­rup­tion in the po­lice force to bu­reau­cratic red tape, not to men­tion an os­si­fied ed­u­ca­tion sys­tem – all this un­der­girded by calls for a new Con­sti­tu­tion that re­bal­ances power and pre­rog­a­tives be­tween the monar­chy and demo­cratic in­sti­tu­tions.</p>
    <p>Call­ing for change from bot­tom up and from the side stand a bet­ter chance of bring­ing about re­form of the monar­chy rather than a frontal at­tack against an in­sti­tu­tion that many Thais still re­spect.</p>
    <p>While protests in the streets grab at­ten­tion world­wide, sound and fury alone will not suf­fice to bring about change overnight.</p>
    <p>Re­form­ing Thai­land af­ter seven decades of rule by a deeply rooted con­ser­va­tive-roy­al­ist es­tab­lish­ment that in its time thwarted com­mu­nist ex­pan­sion­ism and en­abled de­vel­op­ment will re­quire more than that – a will­ing­ness to per­se­vere in what are likely to be long-run­ning ne­go­ti­a­tions, as well as com­pro­mise, will be nec­es­sary.</p>
