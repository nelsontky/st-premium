    <p>STOCK­HOLM • Swe­den’s Prime Min­is­ter Ste­fan Lofven has used a rare ad­dress to warn of the grow­ing threat the coro­n­avirus poses, amid fears the strat­egy used so far may not be enough to fight an in­creas­ingly deadly pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Mr Lofven, the third prime min­is­ter in Swe­den’s his­tory to de­liver such a na­tional ad­dress, said on Sun­day night that “too many peo­ple have been care­less about fol­low­ing the rec­om­men­da­tions” that health au­thor­i­ties say are key if the virus is to be reined in.</p>
    <p>Swe­den fa­mously avoided a lock­down, re­ly­ing in­stead on vol­un­tary mea­sures. But with a death rate con­sid­er­ably higher than else­where in the Nordic re­gion, the au­thor­i­ties are now re­cal­i­brat­ing their ap­proach.</p>
    <p>Mr Lofven’s de­ci­sion to ad­dress the na­tion trig­gered a wave of anal­y­sis in Swe­den’s big­gest news­pa­pers on Mon­day, as editorial pages weighed in on the se­ri­ous­ness of the mo­ment.</p>
    <p>Only two Swedish prime min­is­ters have made sim­i­lar ad­dresses in the past – Mr Carl Bildt in 1992, af­ter a se­ries of racially mo­ti­vated shoot­ings, and Mr Go­ran Pers­son in 2003, af­ter the mur­der of for­eign min­is­ter Anna Lindh.</p>
    <p>In his speech, Mr Lofven said ev­ery­one must do more to fight the virus. “The health and lives of peo­ple are still in dan­ger, and the dan­ger is in­creas­ing,” he said.</p>
    <p>“Ev­ery­thing that you would like to do but isn’t nec­es­sary, call it off, can­cel, post­pone.”</p>
    <p>Ear­lier this month, Mr Lofven took what he called the “un­prece­dented” step of ban­ning pub­lic gath­er­ings of more than eight peo­ple. And from last Fri­day, sales of al­co­hol were no longer per­mit­ted af­ter 10pm. Both mea­sures were a sign that vol­un­tary mea­sures are no longer enough.</p>
    <p>Covid-19 has al­ready killed more than 6,000 Swedes, with to­tal cases well above 200,000.</p>
    <p>In a re­cent re­port by the Or­gan­i­sa­tion for Eco­nomic Co­op­er­a­tion and De­vel­op­ment (OECD), Swe­den con­sis­tently ranked among the hard­est-hit na­tions in Europe, as mea­sured by rel­a­tive Covid-19 mor­tal­ity and in­fec­tion rates.</p>
    <p>The OECD also noted that Swe­den lagged far be­hind its peers in bring­ing down the trans­mis­sion rate.</p>
