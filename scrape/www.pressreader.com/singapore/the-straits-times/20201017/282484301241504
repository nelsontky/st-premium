    <p>Let’s face it – agri­cul­ture is not an in­dus­try peo­ple have given much thought to in ur­ban Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>But if you are one of those who de­cided to start grow­ing your own veg­eta­bles dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker, you are not alone.</p>
    <p>“Grow­ing food at home gives you that feel­ing of self-suf­fi­ciency,” says Mr Dar­ren Tan, ed­u­ca­tion and out­reach man­ager at lo­cal rooftop farm ComCrop.</p>
    <p>“Af­ter the ex­pe­ri­ence that a lot of us had dur­ing the out­break – go­ing to the su­per­mar­ket and find­ing that the pro­duce is out of stock – most peo­ple have re­alised that grow­ing veg­eta­bles at home that they can eat is quite a prac­ti­cal so­lu­tion.”</p>
    <p>Grow­ing your own pro­duce is not a new trend. It has been around for some time, but it has been dra­mat­i­cally ac­cel­er­ated by the dis­rup­tion of sup­ply chains dur­ing March and April this year, and a sub­se­quent in­crease in pub­lic aware­ness of food se­cu­rity is­sues.</p>
    <p>Apart from the prac­ti­cal as­pect, grow­ing your own veg­eta­bles has other pos­i­tive ef­fects on your well­be­ing.</p>
    <p>Your lit­tle patch of green­ery does not only add aes­thetic value to your home, but it also helps you to be more fo­cused on the present and es­tab­lish a much-needed sense of con­trol de­spite the un­cer­tainty of to­day’s tur­bu­lent world.</p>
    <p>You get brag­ging rights too, es­pe­cially if you post pic­tures of your home-grown straw­ber­ries or kale on In­sta­gram.</p>
    <p>Yes, it is now pos­si­ble to grow va­ri­eties be­yond the usual herbs and leafy veg­eta­bles that flour­ish in Sin­ga­pore’s hot and hu­mid cli­mate, thanks to the ad­vance­ment of hy­dro­pon­ics.</p>
    <p>SOIL OR WA­TER?</p>
    <p>While soil is the more com­mon choice, a hy­dro­pon­ics sys­tem has its ben­e­fits: It is eas­ier to clean and al­lows for more con­trol over the grow­ing con­di­tions.</p>
    <p>Since there is less mess com­pared with soil, a hy­dro­pon­ics sys­tem can be placed just about any­where in the home as long as you have ad­e­quate light­ing, whether nat­u­ral or ar­ti­fi­cial.</p>
    <p>It can even be housed in an air­con­di­tioned room, which means you will be able to grow more ex­otic plants such as straw­ber­ries, blue­ber­ries and kale.</p>
    <p>Mr Tan cau­tions home own­ers to do their re­search first, though.</p>
    <p>“Grow­ing berries is pos­si­ble, but it re­quires a bit more re­search and un­der­stand­ing of the growth cy­cle, how to ad­just the nu­tri­ents and the light­ing to en­cour­age the fruit­ing process. Typ­i­cally, the flow­ers of th­ese plants tend to wilt quickly when ex­posed to heat. They’ll need a care­fully-con­trolled cli­mate in or­der to reach the fruit­ing stage.”</p>
    <p>While set­ting up a hy­dro­pon­ics sys­tem may sound in­tim­i­dat­ing, it is an in­vest­ment that can pay off.</p>
    <p>A hy­dro­pon­ics sys­tem takes up a lot less space – where one square foot would typ­i­cally be enough space for only one plant in a tra­di­tional soil-based sys­tem, the same square foot can take three or four plants in a hy­dro­pon­ics sys­tem. This means you can grow plenty more veg­eta­bles even in the lim­ited space of a small home.</p>
    <p>It is also eas­ier to con­trol the nu­tri­ents. You can buy pre-mixed nu­tri­ent for­mu­la­tions in the right ra­tio for plants, so there is less chance of ex­ces­sive nu­tri­ent build-up (which can po­ten­tially be harm­ful to health) as is the case for soil.</p>
    <p>Th­ese days, hy­dro­pon­ics sys­tems come in all shapes and sizes. You can pur­chase off-the-shelf kits on­line or build your own.</p>
    <p>Mr Tan says: “Look for videos on YouTube on how to make sim­ple hy­dro­ponic sys­tems. All hy­dro­pon­ics sys­tems es­sen­tially use the same con­cept. The most ba­sic and ac­ces­si­ble form would be one where you’ll have a con­tainer that holds wa­ter and nu­tri­ents, with the plants sus­pended in it. More com­mon ones in­clude a pump that cir­cu­lates the wa­ter through­out the sys­tem.”</p>
    <p>ComCrop, which aims to ed­u­cate the com­mu­nity on food se­cu­rity and sus­tain­abil­ity via out­reach ef­forts, is also de­vel­op­ing an on­line step-bystep guide that takes you through the ba­sics of grow­ing your own pro­duce at home. It comes to­gether with a kit that home own­ers can use to kick-start their grow­ing jour­ney.</p>
    <p>The main­te­nance is rel­a­tively easy. Af­ter set­ting up, all you need to do is reg­u­larly check that the pump is run­ning and clean the con­tainer oc­ca­sion­ally.</p>
    <p>It is also es­sen­tial to look out for pests when grow­ing pro­duce at home. Com­mon ones in­clude aphids, mealy­bugs and cater­pil­lars. How­ever, if your set-up is in an en­closed room, the chances of th­ese pests find­ing their way to your plants are greatly re­duced.</p>
