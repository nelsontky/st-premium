    <p>An av­er­age of 550 cases a year of maids be­ing made to work il­le­gally by their em­ploy­ers or house­hold mem­bers were han­dled by the Min­istry of Man­power (MOM) from 2017 to last year.</p>
    <p>This formed just 0.2 per cent of the over 236,000 em­ploy­ers of for­eign do­mes­tic work­ers (FDWs) here.</p>
    <p>Three-quar­ters of the cases came from alerts by third par­ties, and the rest were com­plaints made by the maids them­selves, said MOM yes­ter­day in re­sponse to press queries.</p>
    <p>The is­sue of il­le­gal de­ploy­ment of FDWs is in the spot­light af­ter Ms Parti Liyani, a for­mer do­mes­tic worker em­ployed by Changi Air­port Group chair­man Liew Mun</p>
    <p>Leong and his fam­ily, was ac­quit­ted of steal­ing from them.</p>
    <p>Ms Parti had been told by Mr Liew’s wife, Madam Ng Lai Peng, to go to her son Karl Liew’s home to help there. Ms Parti said she also cleaned his of­fice once a week for about a year.</p>
    <p>MOM said it had con­sulted the At­tor­ney-Gen­eral’s Cham­bers and, in May 2018, is­sued a cau­tion against</p>
    <p>Madam Ng and an ad­vi­sory no­tice to Mr Karl Liew.</p>
    <p>An ad­vi­sory no­tice is is­sued when the il­le­gal de­ploy­ment is not con­clu­sively sub­stan­ti­ated, while a cau­tion is akin to a stern warn­ing by the po­lice, and is is­sued when MOM es­tab­lishes that the il­le­gal de­ploy­ment is in­fre­quent or took place over a short pe­riod of time.</p>
    <p>There were no prior com­plaints against the par­ties in the case, said the min­istry.</p>
    <p>From 2017 to last year, MOM took ac­tion against a yearly av­er­age of 155 em­ploy­ers for il­le­gally de­ploy­ing their FDWs.</p>
    <p>Each year, about 60 em­ploy­ers were is­sued an ad­vi­sory no­tice, while 80 em­ploy­ers were is­sued a cau­tion. About 16 em­ploy­ers were given fi­nan­cial penal­ties rang­ing from $3,300 to $24,000.</p>
    <p>MOM said yes­ter­day that a “good num­ber” of FDWs who alleged il­le­gal de­ploy­ment had left their em­ploy­ment when they re­ported the mat­ter to the min­istry. Some asked for help to re­turn home while oth­ers asked to be al­lowed to trans­fer to a new em­ployer.</p>
    <p>MOM said it treats se­ri­ously and looks into ev­ery al­le­ga­tion. In most of the cases, the FDWs had been de­ployed – along with their charges who were ei­ther chil­dren or se­niors – to the homes of close fam­ily mem­bers to pro­vide care to their charges there in­stead.</p>
    <p>The min­istry added that this is per­mit­ted so long as the FDWs ac­cept the ar­range­ments, are not re­quired to per­form the house­hold chores of two fam­i­lies, and have their well-be­ing taken care of.</p>
    <p>MOM said it takes a stern view of cases where maids are de­ployed to do non-do­mes­tic work or to work on com­mer­cial premises reg­u­larly and over a long pe­riod of time.</p>
    <p>“It would be es­pe­cially egre­gious if the FDWs are over­worked and not pro­vided with ad­e­quate rest. Their em­ploy­ers can be is­sued with fi­nan­cial penal­ties of up to $10,000 per count. They will also be de­barred from hir­ing FDWs,” said the min­istry.</p>
