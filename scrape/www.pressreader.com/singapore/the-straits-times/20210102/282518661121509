    <p>LOS AN­GE­LES • John Wall was champ­ing at the bit last week, ea­gerly an­tic­i­pat­ing his first Na­tional Bas­ket­ball As­so­ci­a­tion (NBA) reg­u­lar sea­son game in two years be­fore Covid-19 pro­to­cols put his Hous­ton Rock­ets de­but on pause.</p>
    <p>Now that his quar­an­tine is com­plete, he can re­sume the track he was on be­fore con­tact trac­ing forced him to ob­serve the Rock­ets’ first two games, both losses.</p>
    <p>On Thurs­day, the point guard, ac­quired from the Wash­ing­ton Wizards for Rus­sell West­brook, scored his first points since Dec 26, 2018 with a thun­der­ous left-handed dunk in tran­si­tion.</p>
    <p>He looked ex­plo­sive on sev­eral drives to the bas­ket and dunks in his first game back from a rup­tured Achilles ten­don and fin­ished with 22 points and nine as­sists, as the Rock­ets de­feated the Sacra­mento Kings 122-119.</p>
    <p>James Harden scored a game­high 33 points for Hous­ton, who were also play­ing their first game with DeMar­cus Cousins and Eric Gor­don.</p>
    <p>“I haven’t played in 735 days, so me just get­ting the op­por­tu­nity to thank God and have the op­por­tu­nity to work hard, and go out there and com­pete,” Wall said. “I thought about it all day. I couldn’t sleep last night and I was think­ing about it all day, but when I get be­tween those lines, and once the ball touched my hands, I was fine.</p>
    <p>“It was great to get our first win. My job is to help James as much as pos­si­ble and to try and make it eas­ier for him.”</p>
    <p>Harden sank two free throws late in the game as the Rock­ets held on for the win.</p>
    <p>He had a hand in the fi­nal 18 points for the Rock­ets, who were play­ing in front of a pan­demic-limited crowd of 3,200 in Texas.</p>
    <p>His three-pointer with 3min 5sec left gave Hous­ton a 111-110 lead, and he added two free throws and an as­sist to Chris­tian Wood to build the lead to five.</p>
    <p>The Kings closed within 118-117 on a Tyrese Hal­ibur­ton trey with 22.4 sec­onds left but Harden con­verted his fi­nal four free-throw at­tempts to pre­serve the vic­tory.</p>
    <p>The guard, who is the league’s scor­ing cham­pion for the past three sea­sons, also had eight as­sists and six re­bounds in the first game of a two-game set with the Kings. The two clubs play again in Hous­ton to­mor­row.</p>
    <p>“We’ve just got to keep build­ing now,” Harden said.</p>
    <p>“It’s very dif­fi­cult to beat the same team two times in a row so we know how im­por­tant it is to be locked in and stay fo­cused.”</p>
    <p>Har­ri­son Barnes scored 24 points to pace the Kings, who got 22 points from De’Aaron Fox, 22 points and 13 re­bounds from Richaun Holmes and 19 points and five three-point­ers from Buddy Hield.</p>
    <p>“We look at tonight’s game as a game we feel we should have won,” Barnes said.</p>
    <p>“We ex­e­cuted our game plan and it came down to the wire, but when you look at the mis­takes that were made, they were mis­takes that were eas­ily con­trol­lable.”</p>
