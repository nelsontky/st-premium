    <p>Record seven three-point­ers scored on Christ­mas Day by Kyrie Irv­ing (Brook­lyn Nets) and Dun­can Robin­son (Miami Heat).</p>
    <p>MIAMI • Brook­lyn’s Kyrie Irv­ing and Miami’s Dun­can Robin­son each matched a Na­tional Bas­ket­ball As­so­ci­a­tion (NBA) Christ­mas Day record with seven three-point­ers to ig­nite lop­sided vic­to­ries on Fri­day, as the Heat stretched their hol­i­day win streak to eight games.</p>
    <p>Irv­ing scored 37 points, hit­ting seven of 10 three-point at­tempts in his re­turn to Bos­ton, as the Nets ripped his for­mer Celtics team­mates 123-95.</p>
    <p>“I’m glad we could put on a per­for­mance for ev­ery­body,” he said. “We’re def­i­nitely go­ing to con­tinue to progress ev­ery day.”</p>
    <p>Robin­son fin­ished with 23 points, hit­ting seven of 13 from be­yond the arc, in leading last sea­son’s NBA run­ners-up Miami over vis­it­ing New Or­leans 111-98.</p>
    <p>“Get­ting more and more com­fort­able ev­ery day,” he said. “Last year was a great learn­ing ex­pe­ri­ence. We’re just try­ing to build on it. We’re happy to get this one.”</p>
    <p>Also rolling to a hol­i­day tri­umph were the Milwaukee Bucks, who had a game-high 31 points from Khris Mid­dle­ton to beat Golden State 138-99, thanks to a 72-43</p>
    <p>Bucks edge in the sec­ond half.</p>
    <p>“It was just mov­ing the ball,” Mid­dle­ton said. “We made some de­fen­sive mis­takes but we made some ad­just­ments to cor­rect those. We just wanted to put on a show.”</p>
    <p>In Bos­ton, Jaylen Brown scored 27 points and Jayson Ta­tum added 22 and each grabbed eight re­bounds to lead the Celtics, who had a 54-51 half-time edge.</p>
    <p>But Brook­lyn’s Kevin Du­rant scored 16 of his 29 points in the third quar­ter and the Nets seized a 86-77 edge af­ter three quar­ters be­fore pulling away in the fourth.</p>
    <p>The Nets be­came the first club since the 2008-09 Los An­ge­les Lak­ers to win their first two games by 20 or more points.</p>
    <p>“We can’t ex­ceed our own ex­pec­ta­tions,” Du­rant said. “We know this is a long jour­ney ahead.”</p>
    <p>As for his re­turn to Bos­ton, Irv­ing said: “I went to war with those guys. We’re go­ing to con­tinue to lean on each other as broth­ers off the floor and com­pete on it.”</p>
    <p>Go­ran Dragic came off Miami’s bench to score 18 points, and Bam Ade­bayo added 17 for the Heat, who bounced back from an open­ing loss on Wed­nes­day at Or­lando.</p>
    <p>The Heat im­proved the NBA’s best Christ­mas record to 11-2, de­spite star Jimmy But­ler scor­ing only four points in 16 min­utes and not play­ing in the sec­ond half ow­ing to right an­kle stiff­ness.</p>
    <p>Zion Wil­liamson scored 32 points and grabbed 14 re­bounds to lead the Pel­i­cans, while Bran­don In­gram added 28 points.</p>
    <p>In Milwaukee, two-time reign­ing NBA Most Valu­able Player Gian­nis An­te­tok­oun­mpo scored 15 points and grabbed 13 re­bounds for the Bucks, who hosted a Christ­mas game for the first time since their in­au­gu­ral 1968 sea­son.</p>
    <p>Two-time MVP Stephen Curry had 19 points on 6-of-17 shoot­ing for the Warriors, who were with­out in­jured for­ward Dray­mond Green.</p>
