    <p>The National Trades Union Congress (NTUC) Job Se­cu­rity Coun­cil has seen progress, with more than 20,000 work­ers matched with new roles amid the Covid-19 cri­sis.</p>
    <p>The num­ber of com­pa­nies on board the coun­cil has also risen to more than 9,000, labour chief Ng Chee Meng said in an in­ter­view with The Straits Times.</p>
    <p>The coun­cil was set up in Fe­bru­ary to help dis­placed work­ers or those at risk of los­ing their jobs move into new jobs or tem­po­rary sec­ond­ments in firms in the group.</p>
    <p>Mr Ng said that he hopes the National Wages Coun­cil will look at how to max­imise job preser­va­tion, and at the same time look after the wel­fare of work­ers, es­pe­cially those earn­ing low wages.</p>
    <p>The labour move­ment is also look­ing at cre­at­ing an or­gan­ised body to pro­tect the in­ter­ests of pro­fes­sion­als, man­agers and ex­ec­u­tives (PMEs) dur­ing the Covid-19 cri­sis and be­yond, he added.</p>
    <p>The idea is to have mean­ing­ful and con­sis­tent, sus­tained en­gage­ment to build a re­la­tion­ship with this group.</p>
    <p>The labour move­ment is look­ing at cre­at­ing an or­gan­ised body to pro­tect the in­ter­ests of pro­fes­sion­als, man­agers and ex­ec­u­tives (PMEs) dur­ing the Covid-19 cri­sis and be­yond, said labour chief Ng Chee Meng.</p>
    <p>This comes amid con­cerns about job prospects for mid­dle-aged PMEs, who may have suc­cess­ful ca­reers but have reached a stage in which they are more vul­ner­a­ble.</p>
    <p>“No stone will be left un­turned but, ul­ti­mately, it must be some form of or­gan­ised body to bring them in so that we can ac­tu­ally have mean­ing­ful and con­sis­tent, sus­tained en­gage­ment to build a re­la­tion­ship,” he said in an in­ter­view with The Straits Times on Thurs­day.</p>
    <p>He added that the National Trades Union Congress (NTUC) wants to start the process of pro­tect­ing PMEs in a sus­tain­able way, “not a mil­i­tant way of just flex­ing mus­cles and de­mand­ing and ad­vo­cat­ing”.</p>
    <p>It also wants to pro­vide bet­ter sup­port for dis­placed PMEs through un­der­stand­ing their cir­cum­stances, said Mr Ng, who is NTUC’s sec­re­tary-gen­eral.</p>
    <p>Last year, the labour move­ment made a com­mit­ment to ex­pand its ef­forts in the PME and small and medium-sized enterprise­s spa­ces.</p>
    <p>About 58 per cent of lo­cals – Sin­ga­pore­ans and per­ma­nent res­i­dents – are in jobs clas­si­fied as pro­fes­sion­als, man­agers, ex­ec­u­tives and tech­ni­cians (PMETs).</p>
    <p>PMEs can re­ceive union rep­re­sen­ta­tion. A change in the In­dus­trial Re­la­tions Act in 2015 al­lowed rankand-file unions to rep­re­sent PMEs in col­lec­tive bar­gain­ing, and let unions help older PMEs fac­ing in­di­vid­ual re-em­ploy­ment dis­putes after turn­ing 62.</p>
    <p>There are also PME unions such as the Port Of­fi­cers’ Union and the Air Trans­port Ex­ec­u­tive Staff Union.</p>
    <p>Mr Ng said that gen­er­ally, in­ter­est in join­ing unions has grown as the pan­demic roils the labour mar­ket.</p>
    <p>NTUC told ST yes­ter­day that it now has 950,000 mem­bers. It had 943,000 in 2018.</p>
    <p>Mr Ng said NTUC has also helped non-unionised work­ers such as tour guides.</p>
    <p>It told the Gov­ern­ment that the group is with­out in­come, with the dry­ing up of tourism.</p>
    <p>It prompted the cre­ation of pro­grammes such as the Self-em­ployed Per­son In­come Re­lief Scheme.</p>
    <p>Mr Ng added that non-unionised em­ploy­ees of com­pa­nies which are not unionised can ap­proach the Tri­par­tite Al­liance for Dis­pute Man­age­ment for ad­vice and me­di­a­tion ser­vices.</p>
    <p>In some in­stances, where there are enough work­ers in a non-unionised com­pany seek­ing help from a union, the union can make the case to the com­pany to give it di­rect recog­ni­tion so that it can rep­re­sent the work­ers.</p>
    <p>This hap­pened last year when travel re­tailer DFS Group abruptly re­trenched staff and gave them sev­er­ance pack­ages that were be­low mar­ket norms.</p>
    <p>MEAN­ING­FUL, CON­SIS­TENT EN­GAGE­MENT</p>
    <p>No stone will be left un­turned but, ul­ti­mately, it must be some form of or­gan­ised body to bring them in so that we can ac­tu­ally have mean­ing­ful and con­sis­tent, sus­tained en­gage­ment to build a re­la­tion­ship.</p>
