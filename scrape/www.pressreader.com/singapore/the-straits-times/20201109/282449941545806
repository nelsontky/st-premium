    <p>Each year, lead­ers of Asean’s mem­ber coun­tries take part in what is known as the Asean hand­shake. In a group photo, each leader has his right arm ex­tended over his left and shak­ing the op­po­site hands of those next to him.</p>
    <p>This year, with the Covid-19 pan­demic, such phys­i­cal gath­er­ings have been re­placed with meet­ings by video con­fer­ence.</p>
    <p>But this has not pre­vented the 10-mem­ber re­gional bloc from com­ing up with a slew of ini­tia­tives ahead of the 37th Asean Sum­mit and re­lated meet­ings in Hanoi this week, said Sin­ga­pore’s Am­bas­sador to Viet­nam Cather­ine Wong.</p>
    <p>The key ini­tia­tives in­clude: Set­ting up a Covid-19 Asean re­sponse fund; an Asean Com­pre­hen­sive Re­cov­ery Frame­work to help the re­gion re­cover from the pan­demic; a re­gional re­serve of med­i­cal sup­plies; and push­ing along the Re­gional Com­pre­hen­sive Eco­nomic Part­ner­ship (RCEP), a pro­posed free trade agree­ment in­volv­ing 15 coun­tries, in­clud­ing Asean states.</p>
    <p>“Peo­ple are gen­er­ally hope­ful and op­ti­mistic that RCEP can be signed by the end of this year,” said Ms Wong.</p>
    <p>“If that pans out, it will send a strong sig­nal that Asean re­mains open for busi­ness and trade, and this will boost in­vestor con­fi­dence.”</p>
    <p>Es­tab­lished in 1967 by five coun­tries – In­done­sia, Malaysia, the Philip­pines, Thai­land and Sin­ga­pore – Asean has since fos­tered a cul­ture of co­op­er­a­tion and dealt with chal­lenges col­lec­tively.</p>
    <p>Today, the re­gional bloc has a pop­u­la­tion of nearly 640 mil­lion peo­ple and a com­bined gross do­mes­tic prod­uct of $2.57 tril­lion. Some sug­gest that it is poised to be­come the fourth-largest econ­omy in the world by 2030.</p>
    <p>Viet­nam, this year’s Asean chair, came up with the theme “Co­he­sive and Re­spon­sive” be­fore the Covid-19 pan­demic struck.</p>
    <p>It has turned out to be re­mark­ably apt in the present cir­cum­stances, said Ms Wong.</p>
    <p>Much of Asean’s fo­cus this year has been on how the re­gion can re­spond ef­fec­tively to the out­break and its eco­nomic fall­out, amid ris­ing geopo­lit­i­cal ten­sions, she said.</p>
    <p>“We are con­fronting many chal­lenges, and it’s easy for coun­tries to turn in­wards and fo­cus on their do­mes­tic pol­i­tics. A small and trade-re­liant coun­try like Sin­ga­pore can­not af­ford to do this.</p>
    <p>“It’s im­por­tant that Asean coun­tries are able to speak with one voice on is­sues of mu­tual con­cern – whether it is on han­dling the pan­demic, main­tain­ing sup­ply chain con­nec­tiv­ity, or en­sur­ing re­gional in­te­gra­tion.”</p>
