    <p>From the get-go, Mr Chris Ng makes no apolo­gies for this un­sani­tised walk­ing tour of Keong Saik Road.</p>
    <p>He is up­front about the terms of ref­er­ence: “I am not go­ing to mince words. You will hear un­savoury phrases (re­gard­ing sex)... but I want you to fo­cus more on the sad sto­ries of these women who, since the 1850s till al­most the mid­dle of the last cen­tury, lived in in­hu­mane con­di­tions and were sub­jected to all man­ner of in­dig­ni­ties.</p>
    <p>“And for what? The plea­sure of pay­ing male cus­tomers, both rich and of mod­est means,” says the 66-year-old vet­eran tourist guide and founder of FootWorks Me­dia.</p>
    <p>Right off the bat, he sets a som­bre so­cio-cul­tural tone for this in­au­gu­ral red light district tour, burst­ing the bub­bles of those se­cretly want­ing sor­did de­tails to text home.</p>
    <p>I am part of a group of 10, rang­ing in age from a cou­ple in their 20s to a par­tic­i­pant in his 70s, gath­ered for the Red Light District Walk­ing Tour from Keong Saik Road to Pe­tain Road on the last Sun­day of Septem­ber.</p>
    <p>It is or­gan­ised by FootWorks Me­dia, a home-grown com­pany which used to spe­cialise in road trips to Malaysia, Thai­land and Africa. There is no charge and Mr Ng re­lies on tips to com­pen­sate for his time.</p>
    <p>At one point, he slows his pace and his grav­elly voice fal­ters. “Some sex work­ers from the early days had to over­dose on opium to es­cape the harsh re­al­ity of life in Chi­na­town, much of which was con­trolled by se­cret so­ci­eties...”</p>
    <p>As he clears his throat and strug­gles to re­gain his com­po­sure, it is clear that the plight of the sub­ju­gated women weighs on him, even though he must have re­peated such lines count­less times in his 19-year ca­reer as a tour op­er­a­tor.</p>
    <p>Keong Saik Road to­day, lined with colo­nial-era shop­houses and re­spectably awash in a mod­ern pal­ette of ochres and caramels, is still un­able to com­pletely ex­or­cise its pro­fane prove­nance. Some brothel units, still ac­tive, re­main like glow­ing em­bers of a once-rag­ing fire.</p>
    <p>But Mr Ng says the street was not al­ways a seedy cesspit of opium smok­ers, gam­bling par­lours, liquor shops and broth­els.</p>
    <p>It was a re­spectable busi­ness area from the 1850s to 1930s. Chi­nese clan as­so­ci­a­tions and whole­salers op­er­ated there, when the first waves of skilled work­ers and labour­ers, mainly from the port cities of south­ern China, were drawn to the prom­ise of Nanyang – “south seas” in Chi­nese, re­fer­ring to South-east Asia – shortly af­ter Sir Stam­ford Raf­fles founded Sin­ga­pore in 1819.</p>
    <p>But as was com­mon at that time, busi­ness meet­ings in­vari­ably meant a spot of af­ter-din­ner soiree, says Mr Ng, and what could be more re­lax­ing for stressed-out wealthy men than good food, gam­bling, wine, women and song. And the oc­ca­sional puff on the opium pipe, of course.</p>
    <p>It all started at Lai Chun Yuen the­atre in nearby Smith Street, “a classy set-up”, he says, which cor­nered the market in all man­ner of sense grat­i­fi­ca­tion in the 1850s.</p>
    <p>“Lai Chun Yuen the­atre was for the well-heeled, with singers and pipa play­ers who en­ter­tained rich men,” he adds. In time, the de­mand for se­duc­tion and vice grew and spilled over to Keong Saik Road, which was quick to morph into a red light area.</p>
    <p>The en­tourage stops at 17A Keong Saik Road, the sub­ject of the 2017 mem­oir of the same name by Char­maine Leung, about her mother who grew up in a brothel in the 1970s. It was short­listed for the Sin­ga­pore Lit­er­a­ture Prize in 2018.</p>
    <p>Mr Ng holds up the book and re­flects how Leung’s story about the dai gu li­ong (sex work­ers) of Keong Saik Road paints a poignant, heartrend­ing pic­ture of marginalis­ed women who slaved from morn­ing till night to send their mea­gre earn­ings home to their fam­i­lies and aged par­ents in China.</p>
    <p>Far­ther down, we stop at a shop­house door with a locked grill gate, where pros­ti­tutes op­er­ate to this day. Mr Ng knocks on the door, but there is no re­ply. It is 9.30am on a Sun­day – too early, per­haps?</p>
    <p>The group du­ti­fully fol­lows his lead as he goes to the rear of the shop­house to check for signs of ac­tiv­ity. There, we see three storeys of her­met­i­cally sealed win­dows on 10 to 15 rooms.</p>
    <p>We hit the road again, and stroll past the Sri Layan Sithi Vi­naya­gar Hindu tem­ple at 73 Keong Saik Road, where Chi­nese and In­dian devo­tees smash co­conuts for the res­i­dent de­ity, Lord Gane­sha, the ele­phant-headed son of Lord Shiva and God­dess Par­vati, ven­er­ated as the Re­mover of Ob­sta­cles.</p>
    <p>We reach the last stretch of Keong Saik Road, turn into New Bridge Road to take an MRT train to Far­rer Park sta­tion for the next part of our tour, then gather across the road from City Square Mall, which fea­tures a replica of the arch of New World Amuse­ment Park.</p>
    <p>The park was one of the most fre­netic venues in Sin­ga­pore, at­tract­ing lo­cal labour­ers and tourists alike, with at­trac­tions such as strip­tease shows, cabaret girls, opera shows, jo­get (Malay dance) ses­sions and box­ing matches dur­ing its hey­day from the 1920s to 1960s.</p>
    <p>“One of the most fa­mous names in New World was Rose Chan, the undis­puted Queen of Strip­tease, who wres­tled pythons and bent iron bars with her neck,” says Mr Ng, who watched our ex­pres­sions in amuse­ment as we lis­tened, rapt.</p>
    <p>The first of three amuse­ment parks, along with Great World (which opened in the early 1930s) and Gay World (1936), New World was Sin­ga­pore’s an­swer to Dis­ney­land, sans the squeaky clean im­age. The star acts were wrestler King Kong, strong­man Mat Tarzan and boxer Felix Boy, who re­duced op­po­nents to a pulp on stage – for a fee.</p>
    <p>The park went belly up in 1987, along with the other two “worlds”, which could no longer com­pete with bell bot­toms and disco mir­ror balls in the 1980s, when fun lovers were wooed to dance halls and night­clubs in­stead. Oth­ers stayed home to watch tele­vi­sion and tune into ra­dios, which be­came more af­ford­able from the 1970s.</p>
    <p>Af­ter New World, we walk to Marne and Pe­tain roads and sneak a peek at a mod­ern-day brothel un­der­go­ing ren­o­va­tion.</p>
    <p>Sex work­ers used to ply their trade from tiny par­ti­tioned rooms. “You see those mark­ings on the wall?” Mr Ng points out ver­ti­cal lines made by par­ti­tions about 1.8m apart. Six beds are crammed cheek by jowl along one wall.</p>
    <p>“These are the con­di­tions the women have to work un­der to­day. They charge from $30 to $80, and the men have only 20 to 30 min­utes for one visit,” he adds.</p>
    <p>At the end of the tour, I ask one of the par­tic­i­pants, Amer­i­can Bar­bara Marie Bailey, 52 – whom I spied blush­ing at some points – why she signed up.</p>
    <p>“I found out about this tour on Face­book,” says Ms Bailey, whose hus­band is a teacher at an in­ter­na­tional school here. She left her soft­ware con­sul­tant job in Seat­tle to be with him, and the cou­ple are try­ing to learn about Sin­ga­pore be­yond head­lines and travel brochures.</p>
    <p>“It’s very in­ter­est­ing be­cause these are sto­ries you can’t get from a travel guide­book,” says Ms Bailey, who was quar­an­tined for two weeks when she ar­rived in late Au­gust. Her hus­band came here in mid-July.</p>
    <p>“Mr Ng is very knowl­edge­able and he han­dled the con­tent very well, warn­ing us of what to ex­pect,” she adds.</p>
    <p>I tip and thank Mr Ng for his free tour, thank­ful that I heaved my­self out of bed on a lazy Sun­day morn­ing for this 21/ 2- hour tour.</p>
    <p>I thought I knew Sin­ga­pore, but now, like Ms Bailey, I am see­ing old places, es­pe­cially pink walls and grille gates, with wide-eyed won­der.</p>
