    <p>LOS AN­GE­LES • A cock­tail dress worn by Mrs Michelle Obama, 56, dur­ing her time at the White House and a bas­ket­ball j ersey worn by Mr Barack Obama at high school are among rare items from the for­mer United States pres­i­dent and his wife to join the celebrity auc­tion cir­cuit.</p>
    <p>The dress, a black Nor­man Norell 1950s gown worn by Mrs Obama, dur­ing a 2010 hol­i­day fund-raiser in Wash­ing­ton, is ex­pected to fetch be­tween US$50,000 (S$68,000) and US$70,000 when it goes up for sale in De­cem­ber at Julien’s Auc­tions, the com­pany in Bev­erly Hills, Cal­i­for­nia, said on Wed­nes­day.</p>
    <p>It is the first dress worn by the for­mer US first lady, who be­came a style icon dur­ing her eight years at the White House, ever to come to auc­tion, Julien’s said.</p>
    <p>The items were not put up for sale by the cou­ple.</p>
    <p>“The Oba­mas’ per­sonal items... don’t come up of­ten,” said Mr Kody Fred­er­ick, gallery di­rec­tor for Julien’s Auc­tions. “But ev­ery now and again, some things fall through the cracks.”</p>
    <p>Mr Obama’s game-worn bas­ket­ball jersey from his days on the Pu­na­hou School team in Hawaii comes with the 1979 school year­book, which in­cludes photos of him play­ing.</p>
    <p>The white mesh pullover has the name Pu­na­hou and the num­ber 23 on the front and back. The jersey and year­book have a pre-sale es­ti­mate of be­tween US$150,000 and US$200,000.</p>
    <p>The 59-year-old Mr Obama’s love of bas­ket­ball con­tin­ued dur­ing his eight years as pres­i­dent, and he con­verted a tennis court at the White House to a bas­ket­ball court.</p>
    <p>Mr Fred­er­ick ex­pected in­ter­est to come from “sports col­lec­tors, his­tory col­lec­tors and those who want to feel part of the legacy of Pres­i­dent Obama”.</p>
    <p>The two items will be auc­tioned from Dec 4 to 6. The Obama pieces will go on pub­lic ex­hi­bi­tion at the Mu­seum of Style Icons in New­bridge, Ire­land, and at Julien’s in Bev­erly Hills ahead of the sale.</p>
