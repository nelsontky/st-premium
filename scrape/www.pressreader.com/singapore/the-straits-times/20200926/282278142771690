    <p>In an un­usual sight yes­ter­day, em­bat­tled oil ty­coon Lim Oon Kuin was charged out­side a court­room for an ad­di­tional count of abet­ment of forgery for the pur­pose of cheat­ing.</p>
    <p>The 78-year-old founder of Hin Leong Trad­ing – bet­ter known as O.K. Lim, – was hit with a sec­ond charge. It had to be read to a frail­look­ing Lim in Man­darin out­side the State Courts be­cause he was not al­lowed into the court due to a res­pi­ra­tory prob­lem. On his way to court ear­lier, Lim had to be sup­ported by two women, one of whom is a fam­ily mem­ber.</p>
    <p>His $3 mil­lion court bail was ex­tended yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Lim was ac­cused of in­sti­gat­ing a Hin Leong em­ployee to forge an email and an­other doc­u­ment in or­der to ob­tain more than US$56 mil­lion (S$77 mil­lion) in trade fi­nanc­ing, the po­lice said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>In charge sheets filed in the State Courts yes­ter­day, Lim was ac­cused of in­sti­gat­ing Mr Freddy Tan Jie Ren, a con­tracts ex­ec­u­tive of Hin Leong, to forge an e-mail pur­port­edly sent by Hin Leong to China Avi­a­tion Oil (Sin­ga­pore) Cor­po­ra­tion on Feb 26 re­lat­ing to a sale.</p>
    <p>Lim is ac­cused of in­struct­ing Mr Tan to make the e-mail with the sub­ject header “CAO – Sale of gasoil 10PPM sul­phur”.</p>
    <p>The e-mail, along with a forged in­ter-tank trans­fer cer­tifi­cate men­tioned in the first charge brought against Lim last month, was in­tended to be used to se­cure more than US$56 mil­lion in trade fi­nanc­ing, the po­lice said.</p>
    <p>The first charge al­leged that Lim had in­sti­gated Mr Tan to make an in­ter-tank trans­fer cer­tifi­cate us­ing the let­ter­head of UT Sin­ga­pore Ser­vices.</p>
    <p>The doc­u­ment stated that Hin Leong trans­ferred 1.05 mil­lion bar­rels of gasoil to China Avi­a­tion Oil on March 18.</p>
    <p>It was then al­legedly used to se­cure the trade fi­nanc­ing, the po­lice said.</p>
    <p>Abet­ment of forgery for the pur­pose of cheat­ing car­ries a jail term of up to 10 years and a fine.</p>
    <p>Deputy Pub­lic Pros­e­cu­tor Navin Naidu told the court yes­ter­day that it is pos­si­ble that ad­di­tional charges could be brought against Lim.</p>
    <p>The next men­tion in court will be on Nov 23 at 3pm.</p>
    <p>The two charges fol­low in­ves­ti­ga­tions into Hin Leong by the Com­mer­cial Af­fairs Depart­ment, the white-col­lar crime unit of the po­lice. In­ves­ti­ga­tions con­tinue into other of­fences al­legedly com­mit­ted by Lim.</p>
    <p>Three com­pa­nies re­lated to the Lim fam­ily have al­ready been placed un­der in­terim ju­di­cial man­age­ment. They are Hin Leong and its ship­ping arm Ocean Tankers, and Xihe Hold­ings, which is owned by Lim and his son, Mr Evan Lim Chee Meng.</p>
    <p>Hin Leong and Ocean Tankers had ini­tially sought a six-month mora­to­rium on debts of more than US$3.6 bil­lion to 23 banks, but with­drew this ap­pli­ca­tion.</p>
    <p>The oil trader’s trou­bles es­ca­lated fol­low­ing a probe by the po­lice and in­creased scru­tiny by sev­eral reg­u­la­tors.</p>
    <p>This came af­ter the elder Mr Lim said he had in­structed the com­pany to hide about US$800 mil­lion in losses in­curred from fu­tures trad­ing over the years.</p>
    <p>Court fil­ings note that Hin Leong sold a sub­stan­tial part of the in­ven­tory it had used as col­lat­eral to se­cure bank loans.</p>
