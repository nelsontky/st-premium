    <p>When Kiss92 DJ Carol Smith needs an ex­tra push to com­plete her 7km runs thrice a week, she turns to her favourite Christ­mas mu­sic and fast-paced songs like Bey­once’s Run The World (Girls).</p>
    <p>“When I’m tired but need to go on, lis­ten­ing to a pacy song helps me keep up the pace rather than slow down,” the 45-year-old told The Straits Times.</p>
    <p>“Once you slow down, you start feel­ing de­feated and give in to your tired­ness, then you feel lazy.</p>
    <p>“But when a song that I re­ally like comes on, it helps me run faster and I feel like su­per­woman. It’s like you thought you’re at your max­i­mum, but no! I can go faster.”</p>
    <p>Smith had these songs and her handy Tech­nics AZ70 true wire­less ear­buds ac­com­pany her when she com­pleted 17.5km for The Straits Times Vir­tual Run (STVR) yes­ter­day morn­ing. The in­au­gu­ral event is pre­sented by Pana­sonic.</p>
    <p>The 17.5km event, which be­gan last Fri­day, ends next Fri­day. Par­tic­i­pants can record the dis­tance over mul­ti­ple ses­sions.</p>
    <p>To chal­lenge her­self, Smith com­pleted the run in two days, clock­ing 8.5km in her first ses­sion and 10km in her sec­ond. She was proud that she met her tar­get pace of 8min/km in the sec­ond ses­sion.</p>
    <p>“(The sec­ond ses­sion) was slightly tougher but the weather helped. It’s been nice and windy the past few days which made my runs very pleas­ant,” she added.</p>
    <p>Smith usu­ally runs at East Coast Park be­fore go­ing to the gym in her con­do­minium to run another 5km on the tread­mill and lift weights.</p>
    <p>She added: “Run­ning on the tread­mill can feel mo­not­o­nous some­times. With nice mu­sic, that’s mo­ti­vat­ing and it helps time pass faster.</p>
    <p>“Some­times I get dis­tracted by the sound of my feet pound­ing on the tread­mill, so this pair of noise­can­celling ear­phones is good be­cause it blocks out 90 per cent of the noise. I feel like I’m in a mu­sic bub­ble, which helps me run faster.”</p>
    <p>The AZ70 is an ideal com­pan­ion for those tak­ing on the ST Vir­tual Run. The event also has a 175km event which be­gins on Oct 19 and ends on Dec 17.</p>
    <p>Con­ven­tional true wire­less head­phones can cause brief in­ter­rup­tions of Blue­tooth con­nec­tions when in crowded places but its re­li­able Blue­tooth con­nec­tiv­ity en­sures un­in­ter­rupted lis­ten­ing.</p>
    <p>Be­sides its in­dus­try-lead­ing, noise-can­celling fea­tures, it also boasts high-per­for­mance Mems mi­cro­phones that can sup­press wind noise and re­duce other un­pleas­ant noises, thus im­prov­ing call qual­ity.</p>
    <p>If run­ners ex­er­cis­ing in a pleas­ant en­vi­ron­ment such as a park wish to en­joy the noise in the en­vi­ron­ment, one needs only to tap the touch sen­sor to switch to Am­bi­ent Sound mode to cap­ture ex­ter­nal sounds while lis­ten­ing to mu­sic.</p>
    <p>By tap­ping the sen­sor for two sec­onds, the user can switch be­tween “Noise Can­celling”, “Am­bi­ent Sound” and “Off”.</p>
    <p>The ear­buds’ rounded body fits com­fort­ably in the ears even for long pe­ri­ods of use and when fully charged, the bat­tery pro­vides six hours of con­tin­u­ous play­back (when the noise can­cel­la­tion is turned to “On”).</p>
    <p>Smith started run­ning reg­u­larly in 2007 when she wanted to com­plete the Stan­dard Char­tered Sin­ga­pore Marathon (SCSM).</p>
    <p>But after run­ning up to 18km al­most ev­ery day to train for it, her knees started hurt­ing and she re­duced her dis­tance to 10km four times a week.</p>
    <p>She was also un­able to par­tic­i­pate in the SCSM be­cause of her knee in­jury.</p>
    <p>In­stead, she started en­joy­ing hot yoga as it helped with her flex­i­bil­ity and re­cov­ery after run­ning.</p>
    <p>Run­ning later took a back seat as she started cycling last Au­gust and only ran two to three times a week.</p>
    <p>When the cir­cuit breaker started in April, she stopped run­ning com­pletely and just started again in July be­cause she missed it.</p>
    <p>She said: “I felt very slug­gish and I had put on weight dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker.</p>
    <p>“I missed run­ning. I love the sense of free­dom and it’s a lot of alone time. Run­ning along East Coast Park is very re­lax­ing and I love the beach.”</p>
    <p>Be­sides keep­ing fit, she also uses her runs to im­prove her men­tal health as she med­i­tates and stretches for 15 min­utes at the half­way point of her runs.</p>
    <p>“It’s calm­ing and you can cen­tre your­self in the midst of run­ning. It’s about im­prov­ing men­tal health as well,” she ex­plained.</p>
    <p>“I let my mind go blank for a bit and take in the day. I prac­tise mind­ful­ness and fo­cus on my senses. With Covid, it’s been such a tough year so it’s im­por­tant to re­mem­ber to be grate­ful for the things we have.”</p>
