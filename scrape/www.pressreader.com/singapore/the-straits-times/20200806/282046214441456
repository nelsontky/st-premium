    <p>Do­na­tions to Sin­ga­pore’s arts and cul­tural scene dipped to $50.1 mil­lion last year, but cash do­na­tions were at their high­est in three years.</p>
    <p>The Na­tional Arts Coun­cil (NAC) an­nounced the lat­est fig­ures at the an­nual Pa­tron of the Arts Awards cer­e­mony, which was streamed last night on Face­book and YouTube and recog­nised 103 or­gan­i­sa­tions and 275 in­di­vid­u­als.</p>
    <p>To­tal con­tri­bu­tions last year fell from $57.4 mil­lion in 2018, when giv­ing rose for the first time in three years. But cash do­na­tions last year went up to $40.5 mil­lion, a 23 per cent in­crease from the year be­fore.</p>
    <p>In-kind giv­ing fell from 2018’s record high of $24.5 mil­lion to $9.6 mil­lion last year.</p>
    <p>Min­is­ter for Cul­ture, Com­mu­nity and Youth Ed­win Tong spoke of the need for the arts com­mu­nity to ad­just in the light of the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>“Covid-19 has changed how we cre­ate, con­sume and en­gage with the arts and cul­ture,” he said. “The arts com­mu­nity will need to transform and adapt quickly so that they con­tinue to con­nect ef­fec­tively with their au­di­ences and also cul­ti­vate new ones.”</p>
    <p>NAC’s fund-rais­ing cam­paign, A Covid-19 Rally For Sin­ga­pore’s Arts, launched in April, will run un­til De­cem­ber. It said about 40 arts groups have raised al­most $200,000 so far via the Giv­ing.sg plat­form.</p>
    <p>Many of the ma­jor con­tri­bu­tions last year went to arts in­fra­struc­ture. The Ngee Ann Group, made up of The Ngee Ann Kongsi and Ngee Ann De­vel­op­ment, pledged $55 mil­lion, its largest do­na­tion in two decades.</p>
    <p>NAC said there has been a rise in larger do­na­tions, with the num­ber of Distinguis­hed Pa­trons of the Arts, the high­est tier of recog­ni­tion, ris­ing from 24 to 30. The Pa­tron of the Arts award went to 17 firms, in­clud­ing UOL Group and Sin­ga­pore Press Hold­ings, and 23 in­di­vid­u­als.</p>
