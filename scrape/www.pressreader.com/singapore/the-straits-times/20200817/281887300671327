    <p>MO­GADISHU • At least five peo­ple were killed yes­ter­day when gun­men stormed an up­scale beach­front ho­tel in So­ma­lia’s cap­i­tal fol­low­ing a car bomb blast out­side, a govern­ment se­cu­rity of­fi­cial told Agence France-Presse (AFP).</p>
    <p>Al-Shabaab, a mil­i­tant group af­fil­i­ated with Al-Qaeda, claimed re­spon­si­bil­ity for the at­tack.</p>
    <p>“There is still spo­radic gun­fire and the ini­tial in­for­ma­tion we have re­ceived in­di­cates five peo­ple died and more than 10 oth­ers were wounded. The death toll can in­crease be­cause the blast was mas­sive and there is a hostage sit­u­a­tion in­volved,” Mr Ahmed Omar told AFP.</p>
    <p>State news agency Sonna said gun­fire was com­ing from in­side the ho­tel and that govern­ment se­cu­rity forces had been de­ployed.</p>
    <p>“There are deaths and in­juries of civil­ians who were pass­ing near the ho­tel and oth­ers who were in­side the ho­tel.</p>
    <p>“Among the dead is one di­rec­tor of the In­for­ma­tion Min­istry,” Sonna said, cit­ing the min­istry’s spokesman Is­mail Mukhtar Omar.</p>
    <p>The head of a lo­cal am­bu­lance ser­vice said at least 28 were in­jured. “So far we know 28 peo­ple are in­jured – we trans­ported them be­fore the ex­change of gun­fire be­gan,” Aamin am­bu­lance ser­vice head Ab­dikadir Ab­di­rah­man told Reuters.</p>
    <p>The ho­tel in Mo­gadishu is fre­quented by many govern­ment of­fi­cials, govern­ment work­ers and peo­ple from the So­mali di­as­pora.</p>
    <p>Govern­ment worker Mo­hamed Nur, who lives near Lido beach, said the govern­ment had de­ployed se­cu­rity forces in the area.</p>
    <p>“The ex­change of gun­fire is ter­ri­ble and stray bul­lets reached us near the beach,” he added.</p>
    <p>So­ma­lia has been em­broiled in deadly vi­o­lence since 1991, when clan war­lords over­threw leader Siad Barre and then turned on each other. Since 2008, Al-Shabaab has been fight­ing to over­throw the in­ter­na­tion­ally recog­nised cen­tral govern­ment and es­tab­lish its rule based on its own in­ter­pre­ta­tion of Is­lamic law.</p>
