    <p>John le Carre, whose nu­anced, in­tri­cately plot­ted Cold War thrillers el­e­vated the spy novel to high art by pre­sent­ing Western and Soviet spies as morally com­pro­mised cogs in a rot­ten sys­tem full of treach­ery, be­trayal and per­sonal tragedy, died last Satur­day in Corn­wall, Eng­land.</p>
    <p>He was 89. The cause was pneu­mo­nia, his pub­lisher, Pen­guin Ran­dom House, said on Sun­day.</p>
    <p>Be­fore le Carre pub­lished his best­selling 1963 novel The Spy Who Came In From The Cold, which Gra­ham Greene called “the best spy story I have ever read”, the fic­tional model for the mod­ern Bri­tish spy was Ian Flem­ing’s James Bond – suave, ur­bane, de­voted to queen and coun­try.</p>
    <p>Bond fed the myth of spy­ing as a glam­orous romp. Le Carre up­ended that no­tion with books that por­trayed Bri­tish in­tel­li­gence op­er­a­tions as cesspools of am­bi­gu­ity in which right and wrong are too close to call and in which it is rarely ob­vi­ous whether the ends, even if the ends are clear, jus­tify the means.</p>
    <p>Led by his great­est cre­ation, the plump, ill-dressed, un­happy, bril­liant, re­lent­less Ge­orge Smi­ley, le Carre’s spies are lonely, dis­il­lu­sioned men whose work is driven by bud­get trou­bles, bu­reau­cratic power plays and the opaque machi­na­tions of politi­cians – men as likely to be be­trayed by col­leagues and lovers as by the en­emy.</p>
    <p>“The­mat­i­cally, le Carre’s true sub­ject is not spy­ing,” Timothy Gar­ton Ash wrote in The New Yorker in 1999. “It is the end­lessly de­cep­tive maze of hu­man re­la­tions – the be­trayal that is a kind of love, the lie that is a sort of truth, good men serv­ing bad causes and bad men serv­ing good.”</p>
    <p>Le Carre re­fused to al­low his books to be en­tered for lit­er­ary prizes. But many crit­ics con­sid­ered his works lit­er­a­ture of the first rank.</p>
    <p>“I think he has eas­ily burst out of be­ing a genre writer and will be re­mem­bered as per­haps the most sig­nif­i­cant nov­el­ist of the sec­ond half of the 20th cen­tury in Britain,” author Ian McEwan told Bri­tish news­pa­per The Tele­graph in 2013, adding that he has “charted our de­cline and recorded the na­ture of our bu­reau­cra­cies like no one else has”.</p>
    <p>Le Carre’s ex­pe­ri­ence as a Bri­tish agent, along with his thor­ough field re­search as a writer, gave his nov­els the stamp of au­thor­ity. But he used re­al­ity as a start­ing-off point to cre­ate an in­deli­ble fic­tional world.</p>
    <p>In his books, the Se­cret In­tel­li­gence Ser­vice, oth­er­wise known as MI6, was the “Cir­cus”, agents were “joes”, op­er­a­tions in­volv­ing se­duc­tion were “hon­ey­traps” and agents deeply em­bed­ded in­side the en­emy were “moles”, a word he is cred­ited with bring­ing into wide use if not in­vent­ing it.</p>
    <p>“As much as in Tolkien, Wode­house, Chan­dler or even Jane Austen, this closed world is a whole world,” critic Boyd Tonkin wrote in The In­de­pen­dent. “Via the Bri­tish ‘Cir­cus’ and its Soviet coun­ter­part, le Carre cre­ated a lab­o­ra­tory of hu­man na­ture, a test­track where the in­nate frac­tures of the heart and mind could be driven to de­struc­tion.”</p>
    <p>Born David John Moore Corn­well in Poole, Dorset, on Oct 19, 1931, he had a child­hood dom­i­nated by his fa­ther Ron­ald, an amoral, flam­boy­ant, sil­ver-tongued con man who palled around with celebri­ties and crooks, left trails of un­paid bills wher­ever he went and was for­ever on the verge of car­ry­ing out a huge scam or go­ing to jail.</p>
    <p>Le Carre’s mother, Olive (Glassey) Corn­well, walked out of the fam­ily house and into the arms of an­other man when he was five.</p>
    <p>As crooked as he was, Ron­nie Corn­well craved es­tab­lish­ment re­spectabil­ity for his chil­dren and le Carre was sent to prep school, then to Sher­borne, a board­ing school, which he hated so much, he de­camped for Switzer­land at age 16 and en­rolled at the Univer­sity of Bern to study mod­ern lan­guages.</p>
    <p>There, he was re­cruited by a Bri­tish spy work­ing un­der­cover at the em­bassy, and so his life of spy­ing be­gan. Ex­cept for two years when he taught at Eton, Eng­land’s premier sec­ondary school, le Carre was a spy of some kind for 16 years, for MI6 and its do­mes­tic coun­ter­part, MI5.</p>
    <p>It was not un­til years later that he owned up to his ear­lier pro­fes­sion and he was al­ways vague on the de­tails.</p>
    <p>But while a stu­dent at Ox­ford, where he went af­ter Bern, le Carre kept an eye out for pos­si­ble Soviet sym­pa­this­ers in left-wing groups. In 1960, he moved to Ger­many, pos­ing as a Bri­tish diplo­mat.</p>
    <p>Briefly, he led a triple life – diplo­mat, spy, nov­el­ist, writing his first book, Call For The Dead (1961), in red note­books. The story of the un­veil­ing of an East Ger­man spy op­er­a­tion, it was no­table mostly for the in­tro­duc­tion of Smi­ley and his faith­less wife, Ann.</p>
    <p>For­bid­den by his em­ploy­ers to write un­der his own name, he fixed on “John le Carre”. Over the years, he gave var­i­ous ex­pla­na­tions for it, fi­nally ad­mit­ting he could not re­mem­ber which, if any, were true.</p>
    <p>The Spy Who Came In From The Cold, the author’s third novel, was pub­lished to in­stant ac­claim and world­wide best­seller­dom.</p>
    <p>The suc­cess of the novel – and the fact that a Bri­tish pa­per re­vealed its author’s true iden­tity – al­lowed le Carre in 1964 to quit his un­der­cover work to write full time.</p>
    <p>He pro­duced book af­ter book set against the Cold War back­drop, in­clud­ing The Look­ing Glass War (1965), the Karla Tril­ogy (1974 to 1979) and The Rus­sia House (1989).</p>
    <p>The women in le Carre’s early books were of­ten car­i­ca­tures – the in­genue, the adul­ter­ess and the sex­less crone. But he tried to ad­dress the lapse in later books such as The Con­stant Gar­dener (2001).</p>
    <p>If le Carre painted his Cold War world in shades of grey, his post-911 books seemed in­creas­ingly black and white.</p>
    <p>They had the fa­mil­iar le Carre flour­ishes – chess games of plots, bit­ing char­ac­ter­i­sa­tions, the sense of weak and some­times de­cent in­di­vid­u­als caught up in sit­u­a­tions they barely un­der­stood, in-depth on-lo­ca­tion re­search that he com­pared to “a per­fectly nor­mal es­pi­onage op­er­a­tion – it’s just good re­port­ing”.</p>
    <p>But he be­came dis­il­lu­sioned with Britain and the United States af­ter the 2003 in­va­sion of Iraq and the war on ter­ror and was par­tic­u­larly an­gry at reports of Western tor­ture.</p>
    <p>Le Carre’s first mar­riage, to Ann Sharp, ended in di­vorce in 1971.</p>
    <p>He mar­ried Va­lerie Jane Eus­tace, a book ed­i­tor, in 1972. Their son, Ni­cholas, be­came a suc­cess­ful nov­el­ist too, writing un­der the name Nick Hark­away.</p>
    <p>They both sur­vive him, as do his three sons from his first mar­riage, Si­mon, Stephen and Timothy; 14 grand­chil­dren and three great­grand­chil­dren.</p>
