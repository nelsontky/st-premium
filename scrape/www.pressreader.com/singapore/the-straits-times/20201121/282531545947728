    <p>RACE 1 (2,000M)</p>
    <p>7 Dy­namic Ea­gle has shown that he is ready for the 2,000m trip, es­pe­cially from a favourable draw.</p>
    <p>10 Ex­al­ta­tion can fig­ure with the right run, as he gets up to a suit­able trip.</p>
    <p>5 King’s Race can roll for­ward to play catch me if you can.</p>
    <p>12 Sky Gem nar­rowly missed over this course and dis­tance two starts ago. He will not be too far away.</p>
    <p>RACE 2 (1,200M)</p>
    <p>8 Har­mony N Blessed has tri­alled well. With a pos­i­tive ride from Gate 4, he can make a win­ning de­but.</p>
    <p>2 Ev­ery­one’s De­light is on the up. The awk­ward draw makes it hard but he has the ser­vices of cham­pion jockey Zac Pur­ton.</p>
    <p>12 Gal­lant Crown mixes his form, but the abil­ity is there.</p>
    <p>1 Clas­sic Posh gets the claim and should be in the thick of things.</p>
    <p>RACE 3 (1,600M)</p>
    <p>GROUP 2 JOCKEY CLUB MILE</p>
    <p>2 Golden Sixty is shoot­ing for his 10th straight win and sec­ond Group 2. He swept all three legs of last sea­son’s 4YO Clas­sic Se­ries. This con­test is his to lose.</p>
    <p>7 Mighty Gi­ant is the main chal­lenger, hav­ing won his last five races, all in tena­cious fash­ion. He will look the win­ner at some point. 1 South­ern Le­gend has a weight­bear­ing task. But he has the class as a Group 1 win­ner.</p>
    <p>3 Ka Ying Star will lead. He is tough, but this is dif­fi­cult.</p>
    <p>RACE 4 (1,400M)</p>
    <p>10 Su­per Ten has con­sid­er­able tal­ent. His lat­est trial in­di­cates that he is on an up­ward tra­jec­tory.</p>
    <p>7 Chair­man Lo does not win out of turn. But, on his day, he is good. He gets Joao Mor­eira aboard.</p>
    <p>4 Galac­tic is a lightly raced tal­ent who got off the mark two starts ago.</p>
    <p>2 Triple Triple is next best.</p>
    <p>RACE 5 (1,200M)</p>
    <p>GROUP 2 JOCKEY CLUB SPRINT</p>
    <p>5 Rat­tan put in an en­cour­ag­ing per­for­mance from the rear last start. If he gets a race run to suit, he can fin­ish strongly.</p>
    <p>3 Voy­age War­rior is open to fur­ther improvemen­t, fol­low­ing his first-up ef­fort. He is proven in this grade as a Group 2 win­ner.</p>
    <p>7 Com­puter Patch rates as a lead­ing player, fol­low­ing his near-miss last time in the Group 2 Pre­mier Bowl to Wish­ful Thinker.</p>
    <p>1 Hot King Prawn will need to im­prove, fol­low­ing his first-up run which looked below par. He is a 10-time win­ner from 20 starts.</p>
    <p>RACE 6 (1,800M)</p>
    <p>12 En­rich­ment slots in light with only 51.3kg on his back. With a pos­i­tive ride, he can set­tle close to the speed and score.</p>
    <p>4 Lakeshore Ea­gle is a Class 2 win­ner. From the in­side gate, he should bounce back from his firstup sixth.</p>
    <p>7 Pack­ing Waltham closed nicely for fifth first-up at the Val­ley. He is worth a chance.</p>
    <p>11 Win­ning De­light has the abil­ity.</p>
    <p>But his task is not easy with the widest draw.</p>
    <p>RACE 7 (2,000M)</p>
    <p>GROUP 2 JOCKEY CLUB CUP</p>
    <p>3 Furore grabbed the Group 3 Sa Sa Ladies’ Purse over 1,800m last time. He looks on the right track to re­cap­tur­ing his best, fol­low­ing an ex­tended stint at Conghua.</p>
    <p>1 Ex­ul­tant is Hong Kong’s star stayer. He was an ex­cel­lent first-up sec­ond to Furore. But his best is over longer trips. Also, this is not his tar­get race, next month’s 2,400m Hong Kong Vase is.</p>
    <p>8 Colum­bus County is look­ing for his third con­sec­u­tive win. He won well first-up and is ca­pa­ble of mak­ing the step up to Group 2.</p>
    <p>2 Time Warp is al­ways a ma­jor player with his front-run­ning rac­ing pat­tern.</p>
    <p>RACE 8 (1,200M)</p>
    <p>11 Biz Power was luck­less last start. He is a tal­ent who ap­pears ready to fi­nally go on with it. He has Mor­eira aboard.</p>
    <p>4 Tor­nado Twist can re­turn to form down in Class 3. He is a classy horse on his day.</p>
    <p>6 Win­ning For All is on the up. He de­serves re­spect, fol­low­ing his close last-start sec­ond.</p>
    <p>9 Mighty Valor will look the win­ner for a long way, but is up in grade.</p>
    <p>RACE 9 (1,400M)</p>
    <p>4 Equaletta Blitz per­formed well on de­but. The ex­tra 200m will en­hance his chances. His Aus­tralian form was sound.</p>
    <p>2 Cir­cuit Six, a Group 3 win­ner in Aus­tralia, also per­formed well on de­but. Pur­ton takes over and he should also rel­ish the ex­tra 200m.</p>
    <p>7 The Hulk has placed in his last two starts. From the in­side draw, he should get ev­ery chance.</p>
    <p>3 Lucky Patch won well on de­but, al­beit on the dirt. He bears close watch­ing, de­spite the step up in grade.</p>
    <p>RACE 10 (1,200M)</p>
    <p>10 Win­ning Dreamer is look­ing for his fifth con­sec­u­tive vic­tory. He should get it, es­pe­cially from Gate 1.</p>
    <p>4 Cal­i­for­nia Rad burst clear for an im­pres­sive win last time. His con­sis­tency holds him in good stead.</p>
    <p>2 Vic­to­riam strug­gled last time. But he has since put in an eye­catch­ing trial at Conghua.</p>
    <p>11 All In Mind de­serves re­spect.</p>
