    <p>NEW YORK • Gov­er­nors and pub­lic health of­fi­cials across the United States are plead­ing with Amer­i­cans to change their be­hav­iour as the coun­try shat­ters record after record for coro­n­avirus cases and hos­pi­tal­i­sa­tions.</p>
    <p>Both records were bro­ken yet again last Friday, as more than 181,100 new cases were re­ported na­tion­wide, while Satur­day saw at least 121,000 new cases recorded.</p>
    <p>The seven-day av­er­age of new daily cases is more than 140,000, with up­ward trends in 49 states. Some 30 states added more cases in the last week than in any other seven-day pe­riod.</p>
    <p>The surge is strain­ing the health­care sys­tem as the num­ber of hos­pi­talised Covid-19 pa­tients rose to an all-time high of 68,141 on Friday.</p>
    <p>Gov­er­nor An­drew Cuomo of New York tweeted on Satur­day: “One in ev­ery 378 Amer­i­cans tested pos­i­tive for Covid over the past week. Wear a mask.”</p>
    <p>Mr Cuomo’s math­e­mat­ics is on tar­get: In a pop­u­la­tion of 330 mil­lion, 894,819 peo­ple, or one in 378, have tested pos­i­tive since Satur­day.</p>
    <p>The virus has killed more than 1,000 Amer­i­cans a day in the past week. Wy­oming re­ported 17 new deaths on Satur­day; Ok­la­homa, 23; Mon­tana, 36; and South Dakota, 53 – all sin­gle-day records.</p>
    <p>New Jersey, West Vir­ginia, Mary­land, Min­nesota, In­di­ana, Utah, Mon­tana, Alaska and North Dakota all set sin­gle-day records for new cases the same day.</p>
    <p>A to­tal of 39 Amer­i­can states this month re­ported record daily jumps in new cases, 17 saw record deaths and 25 reg­is­tered a record num­ber of Covid-19 pa­tients in hos­pi­tals.</p>
    <p>In a stark re­ver­sal, North Dakota be­came the 35th US state to re­quire face cov­er­ings to be worn in pub­lic, after Gov­er­nor Doug Bur­gum an­nounced sev­eral mea­sures on Friday, in­clud­ing a limit on in­door din­ing and a sus­pen­sion of high school win­ter sports and ex­tracur­ric­u­lar ac­tiv­i­ties un­til Dec 14.</p>
    <p>“Our sit­u­a­tion has changed, and we must change with it,” Mr Bur­gum said.</p>
    <p>The state has crit­i­cally un­der­staffed hos­pi­tals and the high­est rates of new cases and deaths per per­son in the na­tion.</p>
    <p>In the spring, North Dakota was one of a hand­ful of states that never en­tered a lock­down, and Mr Bur­gum had for weeks re­sisted any new or­ders, em­pha­sis­ing per­sonal re­spon­si­bil­ity in­stead of re­quire­ments such as a mask man­date.</p>
    <p>But the state’s sit­u­a­tion has rapidly de­te­ri­o­rated: Over the past week, it has av­er­aged 1,334 cases per day, an in­crease of 54 per cent from the av­er­age two weeks ear­lier, and deaths are climb­ing fast.</p>
    <p>Hos­pi­tals are so over­whelmed that Mr Bur­gum last week an­gered the state nurses’ union by say­ing that med­i­cal work­ers who test pos­i­tive could stay on the job to treat Covid-19 pa­tients as long as the work­ers show no symp­toms.</p>
    <p>In New Mex­ico on Friday, Gov­er­nor Michelle Lu­jan Gr­isham an­nounced the na­tion’s most sweep­ing statewide mea­sure of the au­tumn sea­son, is­su­ing a two-week “stay at home” or­der that be­gins to­day.</p>
    <p>Gov­er­nor Kate Brown of Ore­gon also is­sued or­ders on Friday to place the state in a par­tial lock­down for two weeks, shut­ter­ing gyms, halt­ing restau­rant din­ing and man­dat­ing that so­cial gath­er­ings have no more than six peo­ple.</p>
    <p>With Thanks­giv­ing and other hol­i­days on the hori­zon, Ms Brown, along with the gov­er­nors of Cal­i­for­nia and Wash­ing­ton, urged res­i­dents to avoid ven­tur­ing out of state.</p>
    <p>Gath­er­ing with fam­ily and friends, they warned, can trans­mit the virus through what New York’s Gov­er­nor Cuomo has called the “liv­ing room spread”.</p>
    <p>Dr An­thony Fauci, the na­tion’s top in­fec­tious dis­ease ex­pert, on Friday re­peated his pleas to Amer­i­cans to take the virus se­ri­ously.</p>
    <p>“If we do the things that are sim­ple pub­lic health mea­sures, that soar­ing will level and start to come down,” he said. “You add that to the help of a vac­cine, we can turn this around. It is not fu­tile.”</p>
    <p>Since the pandemic be­gan, the virus has in­fected more than 10.9 mil­lion peo­ple in the US, killing over 245,000 of them.</p>
    <p>The widely cited model of the Univer­sity of Wash­ing­ton’s In­sti­tute for Health Met­rics and Eval­u­a­tion projects al­most 195,000 more fa­tal­i­ties by March 1 next year.</p>
    <p>The big­gest monthly spike of the pandemic will come in Jan­uary, when more than 65,000 peo­ple are pro­jected to die, the in­sti­tute said.</p>
    <p>TURN THINGS AROUND</p>
    <p>If we do the things that are sim­ple pub­lic health mea­sures, that soar­ing will level and start to come down. You add that to the help of a vac­cine, we can turn this around. It is not fu­tile.</p>
    <p>DR AN­THONY FAUCI, the United States’ top in­fec­tious dis­ease ex­pert, re­peat­ing his pleas to Amer­i­cans to take the virus se­ri­ously.</p>
