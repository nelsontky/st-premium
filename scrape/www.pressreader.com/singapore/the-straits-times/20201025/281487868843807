    <p>Khairul Amri re­calls the agony of an ACL in­jury</p>
    <p>When Khairul Amri and Hariss Harun suf­fered an­te­rior cru­ci­ate lig­a­ment (ACL) tears, both feared the worst for their club and in­ter­na­tional ca­reers. But it was not the end of the road for the Lions, with Khairul re­cov­er­ing to fire the na­tional team to in­ter­na­tional suc­cess, while Hariss went on to be­come na­tional cap­tain.</p>
    <p>In 2011, Amri was 26 and play­ing in In­done­sia for Persiba Ba­lik­pa­pan when he stum­bled into a pot­hole in a league match and twisted his knee, com­pletely tear­ing his left ACL in the process.</p>
    <p>The for­ward re­called: “I cried when I saw the re­sults and it was a com­plete tear. I was ac­tu­ally of­fered a two-year con­tract and had to turn it down, be­cause I would be out for too long and it wouldn’t be fair to Persiba.</p>
    <p>“The re­cov­ery process was crazy, and there were many times I asked my­self why do I want to put my­self through this, and if I should just give up. But what kept me go­ing was the de­sire to play again.”</p>
    <p>ACL in­juries are in the spot­light, af­ter Liver­pool de­fender Vir­gil van Dijk suf­fered a com­plete tear fol­low­ing Ever­ton goal­keeper Jor­dan Pick­ford’s tackle in the 2-2 draw on Oct 17. The in­jury could rule him out for the rest of the Premier League sea­son, a big blow to the Reds’ hopes of re­tain­ing their ti­tle.</p>
    <p>Amri joined the Lion­sXII af­ter Persiba, and while the goals con­tin­ued flow­ing – he scored for Sin­ga­pore in the 2012 AFF Suzuki Cup semi-fi­nal and fi­nal vic­to­ries – he just felt some­thing was miss­ing.</p>
    <p>He said: “I started train­ing af­ter six months out, but I needed an­other six months to get back what I lost, and to get my touches back.</p>
    <p>“Those who knew me be­fore the in­jury would know that I’m a speedy player. Af­ter the in­jury, I felt I had just 60 per cent of my pace.”</p>
    <p>The up­side was it also un­locked a dif­fer­ent di­men­sion to his game as he be­gan to an­a­lyse top strik­ers, fol­low­ing their move­ment, and suc­cess­fully evolved to re­main a pro­duc­tive at­tacker who av­er­aged about 10 goals per sea­son.</p>
    <p>“I man­aged to change my game and be­come more of a think­ing player,” he said. “In the past, I would just push the ball past the op­po­nent and beat them with pace, (but af­ter the in­jury) I re­lied more on an­tic­i­pa­tion...”</p>
    <p>Nurhafizah Sujad, the Football As­so­ci­a­tion of Sin­ga­pore’s head phys­io­ther­a­pist of na­tional teams, said the ACL “forms a criss-cross with the pos­te­rior cru­ci­ate lig­a­ment and holds the knee such that it does not go too much for­ward, and it also pre­vents the knee from turn­ing in­wards too much”.</p>
    <p>She added: “This gives the knee good sta­bil­ity whilst do­ing im­pact ex­er­cises. An ACL in­jury of­ten in­volves a rapid change in di­rec­tion, sud­den stops, awk­ward land­ing af­ter a jump, or di­rect con­tact to the knee. These are com­mon oc­cur­rences in sports like football.</p>
    <p>“It is con­sid­ered a more se­ri­ous in­jury be­cause it re­quires a long pe­riod of time for re­cov­ery and it plays an im­por­tant role in the sta­bil­ity of the knee joint.”</p>
    <p>A 2017 ar­ti­cle in the Bri­tish Jour­nal of Sports Medicine cal­cu­lated that 83 per cent of elite ath­letes were able to re­turn to sport fol­low­ing ACL re­con­struc­tion.</p>
    <p>Nurhafizah said: “Many do re­turn to play high-level com­pet­i­tive football, pro­vided they have done a com­pre­hen­sive re­ha­bil­i­ta­tion pro­gramme. But stud­ies have also shown many would have an­other episode of re-in­jury in the same leg or other leg af­ter re­turn­ing to play.”</p>
    <p>Hariss, who was just 17 when he tore his right ACL af­ter an op­po­nent landed on his leg dur­ing a tackle in a league game, noted the im­por­tance of men­tal strength and dis­ci­pline in the re­cov­ery process.</p>
    <p>Cur­rently re­cov­er­ing from a left knee re­con­struc­tion af­ter slip­ping dur­ing train­ing ear­lier this year, the 29-year-old said: “I was just a year into my football ca­reer then, and I was scared my ca­reer would be over be­fore it started. There were too many ques­tion marks and too much in­for­ma­tion to di­gest.</p>
    <p>“It was very tough as I was jug­gling my stud­ies and re­hab at that time and it took me nine to 10 months to come back. Re­hab was a long and hard road.</p>
    <p>“It is a lot tougher than team train­ing and you re­ally need men­tal strength and per­se­ver­ance. I’m also thank­ful for my fam­ily’s sup­port and for the coaches and phys­ios who pushed me through.</p>
    <p>“Af­ter I re­cov­ered, I felt I lost that yard of pace. But with proper re­hab, I feel it is pos­si­ble to be stronger than be­fore, and the body also learns to adapt.”</p>
