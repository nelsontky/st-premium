    <p>Tourism con­trib­utes only about 4 per cent of Sin­ga­pore’s gross do­mes­tic prod­uct but, last year, the in­dus­try em­ployed about 65,000 work­ers across ar­eas such as ho­tels and at­trac­tions. While the Sin­ga­pore Tourism Board ear­lier had pro­jected tourist ar­rivals to fall by up to 30 per cent this year, the true im­pact of the coronaviru­s pan­demic could be far worse. Num­bers for April and May wit­nessed a 99.9 per cent drop, lay­ing a som­bre prece­dent for the rest of the year be­cause of the way Covid-19 con­tin­ues to spread in the world. It would be un­re­al­is­tic to ex­pect the global sit­u­a­tion to change quickly and sharply for the bet­ter so that leisure travel can re­sume any time soon. The tourism in­dus­try is in for tough times.</p>
    <p>There is, how­ever, some hope still in num­bers. Sin­ga­pore has a sig­nif­i­cant do­mes­tic mar­ket. In 2018, Sin­ga­pore­ans spent more than $34 bil­lion on over­seas travel. By con­trast, tourism re­ceipts for the coun­try in the same year came to $27 bil­lion. Ob­vi­ously, all over­seas spend­ing, post­poned now by the pan­demic, can­not be trans­lated into spend­ing in the do­mes­tic mar­ket. Sin­ga­pore’s small size and fa­mil­iar­ity pre­clude its repli­cat­ing the ex­pe­ri­ence of large coun­tries, where do­mes­tic tourism can be a vi­able al­ter­na­tive to for­eign tourism when na­tional bor­ders are closed to leisure travel. But Sin­ga­pore­ans should help boost lo­cal tourism, by di­vert­ing at least a frac­tion of what they would have spent on over­seas travel, so that at­trac­tions do not stand empty.</p>
    <p>The Govern­ment’s de­ci­sion to spend $45 mil­lion to pro­mote lo­cal tourism sig­nals the im­por­tance of not giv­ing up on the sec­tor in the midst of a pan­demic that has hit ev­ery other eco­nomic sec­tor too. Given the cir­cum­stances, there is also the need to look at how to re­ju­ve­nate the in­dus­try so it can plug in bet­ter to the de­mands of the world once the up­turn ar­rives. Prepa­ra­tions for that have be­gun in the form of a fo­cus on new mod­els, such as where, even if large-scale events can­not take place, they can be bro­ken up into com­po­nent parts – with a lim­ited num­ber gath­ered here, and oth­ers join­ing from abroad aided by tech­nol­ogy. A can­di­date for that ex­per­i­ment is the meet­ings, in­cen­tives, con­fer­ences and ex­hi­bi­tions sec­tor. Two events are slated for this year.</p>
    <p>Their suc­cess could give Sin­ga­pore a leg-up and en­cour­age for­eign play­ers to co­op­er­ate in mak­ing the most of tourist mar­kets in try­ing times. Another in­no­va­tion can be in pro­vid­ing end-to-end ser­vices for the busi­ness trav­eller, who will be the first to ben­e­fit from a grad­ual re­open­ing of travel. De­vis­ing and of­fer­ing ser­vices that cover con­cerns trav­ellers have about be­ing pro­tected from the point of de­par­ture un­til they re­turn home could be a game changer. Op­er­at­ing amid strin­gent health and other reg­u­la­tions and yet of­fer­ing a mem­o­rable stay here are twin chal­lenges the tourism in­dus­try has to meet as it moves for­ward.</p>
