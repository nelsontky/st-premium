    <p>Sin­ga­pore’s bench­mark Straits Times In­dex (STI) ended yes­ter­day 1.75 per cent or 49.87 points lower to close at 2,805.95.</p>
    <p>Nonethe­less, it still gen­er­ated its strong­est monthly price gain for Novem­ber since its 21.3 per cent rise in May 2009, said Sin­ga­pore</p>
    <p>Ex­change mar­ket strate­gist Ge­off Howie.</p>
    <p>Maple­tree Lo­gis­tics Trust was one of just two con­stituent stocks that rose, inch­ing up 0.51 per cent or one cent to close at $1.97.</p>
    <p>Of the STI con­stituents that fell, Jar­dine Cy­cle & Car­riage was the big­gest loser, slip­ping 7.57 per cent or $1.59 to close at $19.41.</p>
    <p>The Big Three lo­cal banks’ share prices also ended the day lower.</p>
    <p>OCBC Bank slipped 0.69 per cent to close at $10.08 and DBS lost 1.87 per cent to $25.20. UOB fell by a larger mar­gin of 2.39 per cent to close at $22.51.</p>
    <p>Mone­tary Author­ity of Sin­ga­pore (MAS) data yes­ter­day showed that bank lend­ing in Oc­to­ber fell for the eighth straight month on con­tin­ued weak­ness in busi­ness loans. Loans via the do­mes­tic bank­ing unit – which cap­tures lend­ing in all cur­ren­cies, but re­flects mainly Sin­ga­pore-dol­lar loans – inched down 0.3 per cent to $675.64 bil­lion in Oc­to­ber, against $677.46 bil­lion the month be­fore.</p>
    <p>De­clin­ers out­num­bered ad­vancers 314 to 156 yes­ter­day, with 2.9 bil­lion se­cu­ri­ties worth $3.65 bil­lion chang­ing hands.</p>
    <p>Across Asia, mar­kets sim­i­larly ended lower yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The Nikkei 225 In­dex in Ja­pan closed 0.79 per cent l ower at 26,433.62, and the Shang­hai Com­pos­ite In­dex dipped 0.49 per cent to close at 3,391.76.</p>
    <p>The bench­mark Kospi slid 1.6 per cent to end at 2,591.34. For the month, how­ever, the South Korean in­dex was up 14.3 per cent – its sharpest monthly gain in 19 years, amid coro­n­avirus vac­cineled re­cov­ery hopes.</p>
    <p>Over in Hong Kong, the Hang Seng In­dex fell 2.06 per cent to 26,341.49, as a re­sult of the lat­est move by the Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion amid es­ca­lat­ing US-China ten­sions. Reuters yes­ter­day re­ported that the Trump gov­ern­ment was poised to add China’s top chip­maker SMIC and na­tional off­shore oil-and-gas pro­ducer CNOOC to a black­list of al­leged Chi­nese mil­i­tary com­pa­nies, ac­cord­ing to a doc­u­ment and sources, thus curb­ing their ac­cess to US in­vestors.</p>
