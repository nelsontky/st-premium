    <p>JO­HOR BARU • A Malaysian Ses­sions Court in the south­ern Jo­hor state yes­ter­day charged the two di­rec­tors of a frozen meat com­pany with us­ing a fake ha­lal logo on com­pany ve­hi­cles.</p>
    <p>The ac­cused, Rah­man Sheikh Ab­dul­lah, 44, and his wife, Rai­hanah Kasim, 42, pleaded not guilty to the charges in front of Judge Mo­hamad Haidar Ab­dul Aziz.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to the charge sheet, their com­pany Rai­hanah Cold Stor­age used the ha­lal logo on its lorry with­out ap­proval from the rel­e­vant authoritie­s on its lorry. The of­fence was al­legedly com­mit­ted at the com­pany’s premises at Jalan Per­ni­a­gaan Se­tia 6 in Ta­man Per­ni­a­gaan Se­tia in state cap­i­tal Jo­hor Baru at around 1pm on Dec 1.</p>
    <p>The of­fence car­ries a fine of not more than RM200,000 (S$65,600), while for re­peated of­fences, the fine is up to RM500,000 upon con­vic­tion. For the sec­ond charge, Rah­man and Rai­hanah, who are di­rec­tors of Rai­hanah En­ter­prise, were al­leged to have com­mit­ted the same of­fence with a dif­fer­ent lorry at the same time and lo­ca­tion.</p>
    <p>The charges came amid con­cerns among Mus­lims in Malaysia about a syn­di­cate that sparked an up­roar over the past week for al­legedly im­port­ing frozen meat and pass­ing it off as ha­lal.</p>
    <p>The case in­volv­ing Rai­hanah Cold Stor­age is sep­a­rate from the ha­lal meat scan­dal in­volv­ing the syn­di­cate, The Star re­ported.</p>
    <p>Judge Mo­hamad Haidar set Jan 19 for the next men­tion of the Rai­hanah Cold Stor­age case and also set bail at RM40,000 for each of the ac­cused in one surety.</p>
    <p>The Do­mes­tic Trade and Con­sumer Af­fairs Min­istry’s deputy public pros­e­cu­tor T. Ashvinii pros­e­cuted, while lawyers Noor Liana Hashim and Lau Kok Guan rep­re­sented the duo, who posted bail.</p>
    <p>In Malaysia’s ha­lal meat scan­dal, 13 police re­ports were lodged against the syn­di­cate, which used fake ha­lal la­bels, Crim­i­nal In­ves­ti­ga­tion Depart­ment di­rec­tor Huzir Mo­hamed had said.</p>
    <p>The syn­di­cate was said to have been op­er­at­ing for 40 years by brib­ing of­fi­cers with money and sex to al­low non-cer­ti­fied meat, in­clud­ing po­ten­tially dis­eased kan­ga­roo and horse meat, to be smug­gled into the coun­try and sold as cer­ti­fied ha­lal beef.</p>
    <p>Ini­tial in­ves­ti­ga­tions re­vealed that the il­le­gal ac­tiv­ity in­volved a wide net­work with lo­cal and for­eign syn­di­cates, said Datuk Huzir.</p>
    <p>The is­sue came to light after re­ports ear­lier this month that the authoritie­s had busted a com­pany that had been im­port­ing meat from Ar­gentina, Brazil, China and Ukraine and repack­ag­ing it us­ing fake ha­lal la­bels.</p>
    <p>Some 1,500 tonnes of frozen meat worth RM30 mil­lion, fake la­bels and rub­ber stamps were seized dur­ing the raid at a ware­house in Se­nai, Jo­hor.</p>
