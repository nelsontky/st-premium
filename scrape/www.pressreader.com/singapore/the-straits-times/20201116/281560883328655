    <p>Pres­i­dent-elect Joe Bi­den’s China pol­icy will be tougher than that of for­mer pres­i­dent Barack Obama. Con­gres­sional dy­nam­ics and pop­u­lar sen­ti­ments in the</p>
    <p>United States sup­port a more con­fronta­tional stance, and Beijing has be­come more as­sertive, says US cor­re­spon­dent Charissa Yong.</p>
    <p>Amer­i­can pres­i­dents tra­di­tion­ally have the most lee­way in the realm of for­eign pol­icy. Pres­i­dent-elect Joe Bi­den’s hand when it comes to China pol­icy, how­ever, will be con­strained by both in­ter­nal and ex­ter­nal forces.</p>
    <p>Ex­pect the Bi­den ad­min­is­tra­tion to take on a more con­fronta­tional ap­proach with China than seen dur­ing the Barack Obama years when Mr Bi­den was vice-pres­i­dent, a time dur­ing which hold­ing Beijing ac­count­able some­times took a back­seat to seek­ing co­op­er­a­tion with it on transna­tional is­sues.</p>
    <p>Un­der the Bi­den pres­i­dency, Amer­i­can pol­icy to­wards China “will be tough but not gra­tu­itously provoca­tive”, as Johns Hop­kins Univer­sity pro­fes­sor emer­i­tus of China stud­ies David Lamp­ton put it.</p>
    <p>China, too, has changed, be­com­ing much more as­sertive in push­ing ahead with its agenda for Hong Kong and Tai­wan, and in flex­ing its mus­cle in its ter­ri­to­rial dis­pute with Ja­pan.</p>
    <p>All these mean that tests of United States re­solve will be harder to avoid now than in the Obama days.</p>
    <p>Mr Bi­den him­self has shown an un­der­stand­ing that the US-China re­la­tion­ship has evolved since his time as vice-pres­i­dent.</p>
    <p>Even if he is in­clined to let co­op­er­a­tion over­ride com­pe­ti­tion, sev­eral things will act as a check on his do­ing so.</p>
    <p>SE­NATE DY­NAM­ICS</p>
    <p>One key fac­tor is the Se­nate Repub­li­cans. Con­trol of the Se­nate is still up in the air and will come down to two run-off elec­tions in Ge­or­gia in Jan­uary, but it seems likely that the Repub­li­can Party will re­tain con­trol of the Up­per House. Democrats will need to win both races, while Repub­li­cans can af­ford to lose one.</p>
    <p>Sev­eral Repub­li­can sen­a­tors have al­ready made a name for them­selves as vo­cal crit­ics of China dur­ing the Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion, and will want the Bi­den ad­min­is­tra­tion to con­tinue to call out Beijing for its un­fair eco­nomic prac­tices and hu­man rights vi­o­la­tions.</p>
    <p>Sen­a­tors Marco Ru­bio, Ted Cruz, Tom Cot­ton and Josh Haw­ley and oth­ers have been be­hind a slew of leg­is­la­tion seek­ing to sanc­tion China over its ac­tions in Hong Kong and Xin­jiang.</p>
    <p>The moves so raised Beijing’s ire that it slapped re­tal­ia­tory sanc­tions on the law­mak­ers for “in­ter­fer­ing in China’s in­ter­nal af­fairs” this sum­mer.</p>
    <p>All four men have been cited as up-and-com­ing lead­ers of the party, and Mr Ru­bio and Mr Cruz even made un­suc­cess­ful runs for the White House in 2016.</p>
    <p>Their drive to hold China’s feet to the fire is likely to in­ten­sify un­der a Bi­den pres­i­dency, fu­elled by per­sonal am­bi­tion and the de­sire to get on the right side of Trump­ism and the more than 72 mil­lion votes that Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump gar­nered this elec­tion.</p>
    <p>They will seek to do so by rous­ing his base and winning it over for them­selves, or by winning Mr Trump’s im­pri­matur for their can­di­da­cies, as for­mer Amer­i­can diplo­mat Eric Edel­man put it in a Brook­ings In­sti­tu­tion talk on post-Trump for­eign pol­icy last Mon­day.</p>
    <p>Pro­fes­sor Lamp­ton said: “The first thing to say about the Se­nate is it’s full of peo­ple who think they ought to be pres­i­dent them­selves and are plan­ning on run­ning for pres­i­dent.</p>
    <p>“You can just plan on there be­ing an op­po­si­tion voice to what­ever Pres­i­dent-elect Bi­den does with re­spect to China. And he will, I’m sure, be ac­cused of be­ing too weak. That will be one cen­tral line of at­tack.”</p>
    <p>For Mr Bi­den, these broad pa­ram­e­ters of do­mes­tic crit­i­cism will be some­thing he will have to bear in mind. But at the same time, hawk­ish Repub­li­cans may give him more room to bar­gain with Beijing.</p>
    <p>“He can say, you know, look, the Repub­li­cans in the Se­nate, they want me to do the fol­low­ing and I’m push­ing back against them,” said Amer­i­can En­ter­prise In­sti­tute re­search fel­low Zack Cooper.</p>
    <p>“There are ways that hav­ing a very force­ful US Se­nate can help the ex­ec­u­tive branch to jus­tify their poli­cies in Asia,” he added.</p>
    <p>But Mr Bi­den will likely draw the line at provoca­tive pro­pos­als re­gard­ing Tai­wan, which China re­gards as a rene­gade prov­ince and treats as one of its great­est sen­si­tiv­i­ties.</p>
    <p>Sen­a­tors Cot­ton and Ru­bio, for in­stance, have been very for­ward so far with their Tai­wan wish list, which in­cludes a free trade agree­ment with the US and a Wash­ing­ton guar­an­tee that it would go to the is­land’s de­fence should main­land China at­tack it.</p>
    <p>“The new ad­min­is­tra­tion will, on the one hand, find it­self in agree­ment with some con­gres­sional ini­tia­tives, but on the other hand, will want to re­sist the more im­pru­dent in­cli­na­tions of the Congress,” said Prof Lamp­ton.</p>
    <p>These im­mod­er­ate voices ex­isted in both the Demo­cratic and Repub­li­can par­ties, he added.</p>
    <p>The Se­nate also has to con­sent to Mr Bi­den’s picks for Cab­i­net mem­bers and other top jobs through con­fir­ma­tion hear­ings.</p>
    <p>A Repub­li­can Se­nate is likely to want to green-light only key of­fi­cials – for in­stance, the heads of the State, Trea­sury and Com­merce de­part­ments – who are not seen to be “soft” on China.</p>
    <p>This likely rules out fig­ures such as Ms Su­san Rice for the Sec­re­tary of State post. She was na­tional se­cu­rity ad­viser from 2013 to 2017, but has been crit­i­cised for lack­ing an in­ter­est in China and for treat­ing it as a strate­gic com­peti­tor.</p>
    <p>On top of this, younger of­fi­cials who are likely to fill key po­si­tions in the Bi­den ad­min­is­tra­tion cut their teeth on for­eign pol­icy dur­ing an era of ris­ing dis­sat­is­fac­tion with China, and have a more pes­simistic view of Beijing com­pared with their pre­de­ces­sors, said ad­junct se­nior fel­low Eric Say­ers of the Cen­tre for a New Amer­i­can Se­cu­rity on Twit­ter.</p>
    <p>One ex­am­ple is Mr Ely Rat­ner, the deputy na­tional se­cu­rity ad­viser to then Vice-Pres­i­dent Bi­den, who is now on Mr Bi­den’s Pen­tagon tran­si­tion team.</p>
    <p>He co-wrote a com­men­tary in the Wash­ing­ton Post in July ar­gu­ing for a new kind of com­pe­ti­tion be­tween the US and China rather than the all-out con­fronta­tion of the Cold War, with some is­sues call­ing for con­tain­ment-like strate­gies and oth­ers for de­fen­sive strate­gies aimed at pre­vent­ing Chi­nese dom­i­nance.</p>
    <p>Should the Democrats win con­trol of the Se­nate, Mr Bi­den’s ap­pointees could lean slightly more pro­gres­sive, since they would not have to fear be­ing shot down by Repub­li­cans.</p>
    <p>But by and large, Wash­ing­ton has a sturdy bi­par­ti­san con­sen­sus to­wards Beijing, backed by ris­ing neg­a­tive at­ti­tudes to­wards China held by the Amer­i­can pub­lic.</p>
    <p>Some of Mr Trump’s non-tar­iff China poli­cies were pop­u­lar in Wash­ing­ton, from sanc­tions on Chi­nese tech gi­ant Huawei Tech­nolo­gies to his des­ig­na­tion of state-linked me­dia as pro­pa­ganda out­lets and re­stric­tions on visas for mil­i­tary-linked aca­demics.</p>
    <p>Congress is un­likely to want them re­versed, and would tell Mr Bi­den so.</p>
    <p>HU­MAN RIGHTS AND MUL­TI­LAT­ER­AL­ISM</p>
    <p>Two other in­flu­ences on Amer­ica’s China for­eign pol­icy stem from Mr Bi­den him­self: his greater fo­cus on hu­man rights and his em­pha­sis on work­ing with al­lies.</p>
    <p>Mr Bi­den has re­peat­edly pledged to be tougher on hu­man rights is­sues, and will likely back or even spear­head sanc­tions against China if it en­gages in what Wash­ing­ton views as provo­ca­tions in Hong Kong and Xin­jiang.</p>
    <p>“Trump just didn’t be­lieve that hu­man rights were a par­tic­u­larly im­por­tant is­sue. I don’t think that’s true of Bi­den. Bi­den has talked re­ally ac­tively about how crit­i­cal hu­man rights are and about mak­ing hu­man rights and democ­racy a core part of his for­eign pol­icy ap­proach,” said Dr Cooper.</p>
    <p>Talk, by it­self, is cheap.</p>
    <p>But such leg­is­la­tion is pop­u­lar in the Se­nate and the House, where there is strong sup­port for hu­man rights and for co­op­er­a­tion with al­lies and part­ners.</p>
    <p>If Mr Bi­den doesn’t take ac­tion, Congress has shown it will.</p>
    <p>The House and Se­nate al­most unan­i­mously passed leg­is­la­tion this year sanc­tion­ing Chi­nese of­fi­cials and banks for their part in de­tain­ing Uighur Mus­lims in Xin­jiang in mass camps, and over Hong Kong’s new na­tional se­cu­rity law.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump, who was no­tice­ably silent on Hong Kong for much of the year and re­port­edly said Chi­nese Pres­i­dent Xi Jin­ping should go ahead with the in­tern­ment camps, ended up sign­ing both Bills into law in­stead of ve­to­ing them.</p>
    <p>Mr Bi­den, with his em­pha­sis on hu­man rights, is more likely to em­brace such leg­is­la­tion more en­thu­si­as­ti­cally.</p>
    <p>He has also said he will em­pha­sise work­ing more closely with al­lies and part­ners seek­ing sup­port on the China front.</p>
    <p>These coun­tries are likely to be spooked by an in­creas­ingly as­sertive China and to com­mu­ni­cate their se­cu­rity con­cerns to the Bi­den ad­min­is­tra­tion.</p>
    <p>“China seems less in­ter­ested un­der Xi in re­as­sur­ing US al­lies. And so when US al­lies feel less re­as­sured by China, they are more in­clined to seek some mea­sure of se­cu­rity by hav­ing closer ties with the US,” said Prof Lamp­ton.</p>
    <p>Mr Bi­den, he reck­oned, would be more sen­si­tive to these Asian coun­tries’ dilemma of bal­anc­ing se­cu­rity con­cerns with eco­nomic ties, and sound them out on China pol­icy.</p>
    <p>One of the big­gest changes the Bi­den ad­min­is­tra­tion is ex­pected to make in the Asia-Pa­cific re­gion will be shoring up re­la­tion­ships there that Mr Trump may have ne­glected, which would be good news for Asean, said Dr Cooper.</p>
    <p>“Along with these sort of tougher poli­cies on China, I do think you should ex­pect a real re­nais­sance in en­gage­ment be­tween the US and both Asean and Asean mem­bers.”</p>
    <p>From Congress to White House of­fi­cials to al­lies, many forces are lined up to pre­clude a re­turn by Mr Bi­den to the Obama years when com­pe­ti­tion with China was less overt. Mr Bi­den, in his com­ments, has in­di­cated an un­der­stand­ing of this re­al­ity.</p>
    <p>Said Dr Cooper: “I don’t think we’re go­ing back to the Obama years where peo­ple were so op­ti­mistic about the US-China re­la­tion­ship. I think the re­la­tion­ship has changed. I think China has changed.</p>
    <p>“There is broad agree­ment be­tween Congress and be­tween the Bi­den team, that China is a chal­lenge that isn’t go­ing away any time soon. It has to be con­fronted head-on.”</p>
