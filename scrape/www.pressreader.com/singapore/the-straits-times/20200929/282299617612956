    <p>•</p>
    <p>Any move from the Premier League to change the hand­ball law for next sea­son would need to be sub­mit­ted to in­ter­na­tional law­mak­ing body In­ter­na­tional Football As­so­ci­a­tion Board (Ifab) next month in or­der to be con­sid­ered.</p>
    <p>Ifab holds its an­nual meet­ing, the fo­rum where laws are passed and changed, in March but ac­cord­ing to its pro­to­col, football as­so­ci­a­tions need to put in pro­pos­als by Nov 1 in or­der to al­low time for con­sul­ta­tions across the game.</p>
    <p>A se­ries of con­tro­ver­sial hand­ball de­ci­sions in the open­ing weeks of the Premier League has led to calls from some in the English game for the law to be changed.</p>
    <p>While the laws of the game are ap­plied on an in­ter­na­tional scale, Bri­tish football has a uniquely prom­i­nent role in the cre­ation of the laws. The de­ci­sion-mak­ing Gen­eral Assem­bly of Ifab is made up of the four Bri­tish football as­so­ci­a­tions (Eng­land, Scot­land, Wales and North­ern Ire­land) and four rep­re­sen­ta­tives of Fifa.</p>
    <p>All de­ci­sions re­quire a three-quar­ters ma­jor­ity, which in prac­tice means Fifa’s rep­re­sen­ta­tives would need to agree to any Bri­tish pro­posal. The de­ci­sion on what items are on the agenda will be made at an an­nual meet­ing next month.</p>
    <p>Crys­tal Palace boss Roy Hodg­son said he was “dis­il­lu­sioned” with the game af­ter his side lost to a penalty awarded for a dis­puted hand­ball.</p>
    <p>“I don’t un­der­stand how we’ve al­lowed it to hap­pen. The Premier League, the ref­eree, the coaches, the man­agers, the play­ers, I don’t know how we’ve al­lowed this type of sit­u­a­tion, which we have at vir­tu­ally ev­ery match at the mo­ment, to oc­cur be­cause the rules of football are im­por­tant,” he said af­ter the 2-1 loss to Ever­ton on Satur­day.</p>
    <p>A day later, New­cas­tle were given a stop­page-time penalty af­ter the ref­eree via the video as­sis­tant ref­eree ruled that Tot­ten­ham’s Eric Dier had han­dled the ball as he jumped up for an aerial chal­lenge with New­cas­tle’s Andy Car­roll.</p>
    <p>Mag­pies man­ager Steve Bruce, de­spite ben­e­fit­ing from the de­ci­sion, de­scribed it as “non­sense”.</p>
    <p>“Maybe Roy is right, maybe we all need to get to­gether,” he added.</p>
    <p>“The de­ci­sions are ru­in­ing the spec­ta­cle. We have to get to­gether as man­agers and say this must stop.”</p>
    <p>For­mer Liver­pool and Eng­land de­fender Jamie Car­ragher, now a pun­dit with Sky Sports, also weighed in.</p>
    <p>“Whether it’s the Premier League, the FA, Fifa, Pier­luigi Col­lina (chair­man of the Fifa ref­er­ees’ com­mit­tee), who­ever’s in­volved in this – stop it, be­cause you are ru­in­ing football for ev­ery­body,” he said.</p>
    <p>There has been no in­di­ca­tion from the Premier League or the FA that they in­tend to re­quest a change to the law. The Premier League did not im­me­di­ately re­spond to a re­quest for com­ment and Ifab de­clined to com­ment.</p>
    <p>One op­tion to deal with the con­cerns would be for the ref­er­ees body, Pro­fes­sional Game Match Of­fi­cials Lim­ited, to change its in­ter­pre­ta­tion of the law back to last sea­son’s ap­proach but that risks con­flict with Fifa and its ref­eree bod­ies.</p>
    <p>Pun­dit Graeme Souness ad­mit­ted the rules are harsh but could lead to more con­tro­versy and ex­cite­ment.</p>
    <p>“Maybe go­ing for­ward, we’ll think there’s more goals be­ing scored, more for us to talk about, more ex­cite­ment in the sta­di­ums,” he said. The Premier League saw seven goals scored from penal­ties last week­end – the high­est num­ber af­ter Sept 13-14 in 2003 (eight).</p>

The hand&#xAD;ball in&#xAD;ci&#xAD;dent was the lat&#xAD;est in a string of con&#xAD;tested penalty de&#xAD;ci&#xAD;sions awarded in the first three rounds of the new cam&#xAD;paign.</p>
