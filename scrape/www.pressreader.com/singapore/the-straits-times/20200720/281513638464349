    <p>After sev­eral peo­ple ques­tioned why a “for­eigner” was singing this year’s Na­tional Day Pa­rade (NDP) song Ev­ery­thing I Am, the song’s per­former Nathan Hartono has clar­i­fied that he is a Sin­ga­porean.</p>
    <p>In a Face­book post last Satur­day, singer-song­writer Hartono, 28, said he is proud to be a first-gen­er­a­tion Sin­ga­porean who has done two years of na­tional ser­vice.</p>
    <p>In a series of ac­com­pa­ny­ing pic­tures, in­clud­ing one with a lone tear rolling down his cheek, he shared a se­lec­tion of Face­book com­ments on his NDP song, which had ques­tioned his na­tion­al­ity.</p>
    <p>One said: “Why is an In­done­sian singing the NDP song... does Sin­ga­pore not have any singing tal­ent as well? Come on... se­ri­ously?”, while an­other said: “Dis­grace... ask PR to sing NDP song.”</p>
    <p>In his post, Hartono ex­plained that he was born and raised here as a per­ma­nent res­i­dent to In­done­sian par­ents who im­mi­grated here. “After serv­ing two years of na­tional ser­vice, I was fi­nally able to get a Sin­ga­porean cit­i­zen­ship,” he added.</p>
    <p>His mother, Madam Jo­ce­lyn Tjioe, is a se­nior vice-pres­i­dent of restau­rant chain TungLok Group, while his fa­ther, Mr Thomas Hartono, is a re­sort con­sul­tant. In an in­ter­view with The Straits Times in 2016, the singer men­tioned that his sib­lings Nor­man and Ny­dia were also born in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>Hartono wrote in his Face­book post: “I’ve never known any other place as home. And I am thank­ful for ev­ery­thing this land has given me. Love to you all.”</p>
    <p>The mu­sic video for this year’s NDP song Ev­ery­thing I Am, di­rected by lo­cal film-maker He Shum­ing, was re­leased on­line last Tues­day. Com­posed by pro­ducer Joshua Wan, the song cen­tres on the mes­sage of en­cour­ag­ing Sin­ga­pore­ans to ex­press grat­i­tude and ap­pre­ci­a­tion for one an­other.</p>
    <p>Hartono rose to promi­nence after he fin­ished as first run­ner-up in the first sea­son of the Chi­nese re­al­ity singing com­pe­ti­tion Sing! China in 2016. The fol­low­ing year, he was nom­i­nated for The Straits Times Sin­ga­porean of the Year award.</p>
    <p>He has since signed with Warner Mu­sic China and Sin­ga­pore and taken on act­ing gigs, star­ring in the­atre shows, Web series and last year’s film, When Ghost Meets Zom­bie.</p>
