    <p>Pas­try chef Jan­ice Wong has de­signed an Egg Man T-shirt that she cheek­ily says might en­dow the wearer with “spe­cial pow­ers”, es­pe­cially dur­ing the coro­n­avirus pan­demic.</p>
    <p>“My hope is when peo­ple wear the T-shirt, they feel like they have spe­cial pow­ers and can do any­thing and ev­ery­thing,” says the owner of home-grown dessert restau­rant 2am: dessert­bar.</p>
    <p>She is one of 10 de­sign­ers from var­i­ous dis­ci­plines, who have come to­gether to cre­ate a range of T-shirts to raise funds for vul­ner­a­ble mi­grant work­ers in Sin­ga­pore dur­ing Covid-19.</p>
    <p>The ini­tia­tive is a col­lab­o­ra­tion be­tween The So­ci­ety of In­te­rior De­sign­ers, Sin­ga­pore (Sids) and the Min­istry of Man­power (MOM). The so­ci­ety hopes to raise $38,000 through the sale of 1,000 T-shirts, priced at $38 each.</p>
    <p>Pro­ceeds from the T-shirt fundrais­ing cam­paign – called Op­er­a­tion De-Covid-19 – will go to­wards the Mi­grant Work­ers As­sis­tance Fund, the hu­man­i­tar­ian char­ity of the Mi­grant Work­ers’ Cen­tre.</p>
    <p>Chef Wong says she cre­ated a car­toon called Choco­late Egg Man, who is “strong, coura­geous, self­less and ad­ven­tur­ous”.</p>
    <p>“My T-shirt’s mes­sage is to stay strong and to­gether dur­ing this time,” says the 37-year-old, who rep­re­sented Sin­ga­pore as a guest judge in the sea­son fi­nale of pop­u­lar Amer­i­can re­al­ity cook­ing com­pe­ti­tion Top Chef in Novem­ber last year.</p>
    <p>The other de­sign­ers who con­trib­uted cre­atively to the ini­tia­tive are Sids pres­i­dent Keat Ong, streetwear de­sign­ers An­drew Loh and Kenny Lim, se­nior de­sign direc­tor of Na­tional Parks Board (NParks) Damian Tang; Black De­sign’s cre­ative direc­tor Jack­son Tan, ar­chi­tects Look Boon Gee and Khairudin Sa­harom, mul­ti­dis­ci­plinary de­signer Kel­ley Cheng, in­dus­trial de­signer Kenny Hong and in­te­rior de­signer Peter Tay.</p>
    <p>Project leader Ong says he was driven to spear­head the cam­paign out of con­cern for the wel­fare of for­eign work­ers in Sin­ga­pore fac­ing re­stric­tions dur­ing Covid-19.</p>
    <p>“For­eign work­ers are an in­te­gral part of our work­force and so­ci­ety,” he says. “This is even more so for me as I’m work­ing in the built-en­vi­ron­ment in­dus­try and we had and are still fac­ing the detri­men­tal ef­fects of a work­force short­age.”</p>
    <p>“The pan­demic has hap­pened and will live through our mem­o­ries whether we like it or not,” says Mr Ong, whose de­sign in­volves dif­fer­ent it­er­a­tions of the virus be­ing “shelved away”.</p>
    <p>“We can­not de­stroy or erase th­ese mem­o­ries, but we sure can shelve them like old archives and learn valu­able lessons from them.”</p>
    <p>Mean­while, NPark’s Mr Tang, an award-win­ning land­scape ar­chi­tect, de­cided to em­bla­zon a black Tshirt with lush green­ery and cutouts of for­eign work­ers.</p>
    <p>“When we speak and ap­pre­ci­ate the beau­ti­ful land­scapes of Sin­ga­pore, we hardly as­so­ci­ate it with the mi­grant work­ers, who work hard daily on the plant­ing and main­te­nance, through rain or shine,” he says.</p>
    <p>“The de­sign aims to re­mind us that our achieve­ment from a hum­ble Gar­den City to a world renowned City in a Gar­den and, now, to­wards a City in Na­ture, re­quires com­mit­ment and stew­ard­ship at every level. And that we should not take the hard­ship of our land­scape work­ers for granted.”</p>
    <p>Ms Cheng, a mul­ti­dis­ci­plinary de­signer and founder of de­sign firm The Press Room, says she had a eureka mo­ment when she toyed with the idea of the novel coro­n­avirus sprout­ing arms with clenched fists in­stead of its signature spikes.</p>
    <p>“I saw the pos­si­bil­ity of play­ing with the form of the virus and turned it into a pos­i­tive art­work to show the world fight­ing the virus to­gether,” says Ms Cheng, who trained as an ar­chi­tect, but has a var­ied de­sign port­fo­lio, in­clud­ing books, mag­a­zines, in­te­ri­ors and posters.</p>
    <p>“Covid-19 has af­fected every sin­gle life in the world, but the pan­demic has also brought the world to­gether,” says the de­signer who last year held a ret­ro­spec­tive ex­hi­bi­tion, Pro­por­tion & Emo­tion, which was co-pre­sented by the De­signSin­ga­pore Coun­cil.</p>
    <p>“Every con­ti­nent, every coun­try and every one of us are all fight­ing this to­gether. My art­work is a cel­e­bra­tion of the hu­man spirit, in which every cri­sis brings peo­ple closer to­gether, and the world stands as one against this virus.”</p>
