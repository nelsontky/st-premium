    <p>Demo­cratic can­di­date Joe Bi­den was pro­jected to win the cru­cial bat­tle­ground states of Wis­con­sin and Michi­gan, strength­en­ing his lead over US Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump, although the race re­mained too close to call at press time, past mid­night in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>Demo­cratic can­di­date Joe Bi­den was pro­jected to win the cru­cial bat­tle­ground states of Wis­con­sin and Michi­gan, strength­en­ing his lead over United States Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump, although the race re­mained too close to call at press time, past mid­night in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump sought a re­count in Wis­con­sin and mounted le­gal chal­lenges to stop bal­lots be­ing counted in Michi­gan, Ge­or­gia and Penn­syl­va­nia – all the key states he needs for a vi­able path to vic­tory.</p>
    <p>Michi­gan’s 16 elec­toral votes and Wis­con­sin’s 10 po­ten­tially give Mr</p>
    <p>Bi­den a to­tal of 264 elec­toral votes – six shy of the 270 he needs to win the pres­i­dency. Mr Trump has 214.</p>
    <p>Mr Bi­den will be able to claim the pres­i­dency if he wins any one swing state where count­ing is still on­go­ing: Ne­vada, where he holds a slim lead, and Ge­or­gia and Penn­syl­va­nia, where Mr Trump is ahead but with a mar­gin that is nar­row­ing.</p>
    <p>Later-counted votes from ab­sen­tee bal­lots, as well as from large ur­ban ar­eas that are Demo­cratic stronghold­s, have the po­ten­tial to drag Mr Bi­den over the line in Ge­or­gia and Penn­syl­va­nia.</p>
    <p>He will also need to hold Ari­zona, a close race that Fox News and the As­so­ci­ated Press (AP) have al­ready called for him. His lead over Mr Trump nar­rowed slightly as the state’s largest county, Mari­copa, re­leased more re­sults.</p>
    <p>Pro-Bi­den protesters in cities across the US de­manded that ev­ery vote be counted, while pro-Trump crowds gath­ered out­side count­ing cen­tres in Ari­zona and Michi­gan de­mand­ing a stop to vote-count­ing.</p>
    <p>Mr Bi­den said it was clear he would have enough elec­toral votes to win the pres­i­dency, calling for unity af­ter an elec­tion sea­son marked by ran­cour and di­vi­sion.</p>
    <p>“I am not here to de­clare that I have won. I am here to re­port that when the count is fin­ished, I be­lieve I will be the win­ner,” he said in a speech from his home town of Wilmington, Delaware.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day morn­ing, his cam­paign man­ager Jen O’Mal­ley Dil­lon said vic­tory was im­mi­nent and ex­pected later that day. She said Mr Bi­den was “near­ing par­ity” with Mr Trump in Penn­syl­va­nia and pro­jected that most of the re­main­ing bal­lots there would give the Demo­crat the win. She also said he was ex­pected to win Ne­vada.</p>
    <p>The Trump cam­paign’s law­suits were “mer­it­less and noth­ing more than an at­tempt to dis­tract and de­lay what is now in­evitable”, she said.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump, who has been seek­ing for months to in­val­i­date mail-in bal­lots and mak­ing un­sub­stan­ti­ated claims that they were sus­cep­ti­ble to fraud, took to Twit­ter to com­plain about be­ing over­taken in Michi­gan and else­where.</p>
    <p>He al­leged voter fraud, with­out ev­i­dence, and claimed vic­tory in Penn­syl­va­nia, Ge­or­gia and North Carolina, even though all three states are still count­ing votes. “Any vote that came in af­ter elec­tion day will not be counted!” Mr Trump said in a tweet yes­ter­day morn­ing, which Twit­ter flagged as mis­lead­ing.</p>
    <p>His cam­paign sought a re­count in Wis­con­sin, where Mr Trump lost by 0.7 per­cent­age point. Wis­con­sin law al­lows a re­count if the mar­gin be­tween the top two can­di­dates is less than 1 per cent.</p>
    <p>Mr Bill Stepien, man­ager of the Trump cam­paign, said it was not given “mean­ing­ful ac­cess” to sev­eral count­ing lo­ca­tions in Michi­gan and has filed a suit to halt count­ing un­til ac­cess is given.</p>
    <p>The Trump cam­paign also filed to join a law­suit by the state’s Repub­li­can Party chal­leng­ing a Supreme Court de­ci­sion to ac­cept mail-in bal­lots re­ceived up to three days af­ter elec­tion day. The bal­lots must be post­marked by elec­tion day.</p>
    <p>With bal­lots still be­ing counted, Mr Bi­den has al­ready re­ceived about 72.1 mil­lion votes, tak­ing 50.4 per cent of the vote share, ac­cord­ing to AP, and beat­ing the pre­vi­ous record of 69.5 mil­lion votes set in 2008 by former pres­i­dent Barack Obama.</p>
    <p>So far, Mr Trump has re­ceived about 68.7 mil­lion votes. He lost the pop­u­lar vote by nearly three mil­lion votes in 2016, but beat Mrs Hillary Clin­ton on elec­toral votes.</p>
    <p>(Delaware) • With the US pres­i­den­tial race be­tween Repub­li­can Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump and Demo­cratic chal­lenger Joe Bi­den too close to call, Mr Trump has turned to the courts to try to in­val­i­date votes in Penn­syl­va­nia and block Michi­gan of­fi­cials from count­ing bal­lots.</p>
    <p>Be­low is a list of the cases that will play out in the com­ing days and pos­si­bly weeks.</p>
    <p>BAL­LOT-COUNT­ING FIGHT IN MICHI­GAN</p>
    <p>Mr Trump’s cam­paign said on Wed­nes­day it has filed a law­suit in Michi­gan to stop state of­fi­cials from count­ing bal­lots.</p>
    <p>The cam­paign said the case in the Michi­gan Court of Claims seeks to halt count­ing un­til it has an elec­tion in­spec­tor at each ab­sen­tee voter count­ing board. The cam­paign also wanted to re­view bal­lots which were opened and counted be­fore an in­spec­tor from its cam­paign was present.</p>
    <p>PENN­SYL­VA­NIA COURT BAT­TLES</p>
    <p>Repub­li­can of­fi­cials on Tues­day sued elec­tion of­fi­cials in Mont­gomery County, which bor­ders Philadel­phia, ac­cus­ing them of il­le­gally count­ing mail-in bal­lots early and giv­ing vot­ers who sub­mit­ted de­fec­tive bal­lots a chance to re-vote.</p>
    <p>At a hear­ing on Wed­nes­day, US District Judge Ti­mothy Sav­age in Philadel­phia ap­peared scep­ti­cal of their al­le­ga­tions and how the in­tegrity of the elec­tion might be af­fected.</p>
    <p>In a sep­a­rate law­suit, the Trump cam­paign asked a judge to halt bal­lot count­ing in Penn­syl­va­nia, claim­ing that Repub­li­cans had been un­law­fully de­nied ac­cess to ob­serve the process.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, Repub­li­cans in Penn</p>
    <p>syl­va­nia have asked the US Supreme Court to re­view a de­ci­sion of the state’s high­est court that al­lowed elec­tion of­fi­cials to count mail-in bal­lots post­marked by elec­tion day that ar­rived through Fri­day. On Wed­nes­day, Mr Trump’s cam­paign filed a mo</p>
    <p>tion to in­ter­vene in the case.</p>
    <p>US Supreme Court jus­tices said last week there was not enough time to de­cide the mer­its of the case be­fore elec­tion day, but in­di­cated they might re­visit it later.</p>
    <p>Jus­tice Sa­muel Al­ito, joined by fel­low con­ser­va­tives Clarence</p>
    <p>Thomas and Neil Gor­such, said in a writ­ten opin­ion that there is a “strong like­li­hood” the Penn­syl­va­nia court’s de­ci­sion vi­o­lated the US Constituti­on.</p>
    <p>U.S. POSTAL SER­VICE LIT­I­GA­TION</p>
    <p>A US judge on Wed­nes­day said</p>
    <p>Post­mas­ter-Gen­eral Louis DeJoy must an­swer ques­tions about why the US Postal Ser­vice failed to com­plete a court-or­dered sweep for un­de­liv­ered bal­lots in about a dozen states be­fore a Tues­day af­ter­noon dead­line.</p>
    <p>US District Judge Em­met Sul­li­van is over­see­ing a law­suit by Vote For­ward, the Na­tional As­so­ci­a­tion for the Ad­vance­ment of Coloured Peo­ple and Latino com­mu­nity ad­vo­cates who have been de­mand­ing that the postal ser­vice de­liver mailin bal­lots in time to be counted in the elec­tion.</p>
    <p>GE­OR­GIA BAL­LOT FIGHT</p>
    <p>The Trump cam­paign on Wed­nes­day evening filed a law­suit in state court in Chatham County, Ge­or­gia, say­ing it re­ceived in­for­ma­tion that late-ar­riv­ing bal­lots were im­prop­erly min­gled with valid bal­lots, and asked a judge to en­ter an or­der mak­ing sure late-ar­riv­ing bal­lots were sep­a­rated so that they would not be counted.</p>
    <p>NE­VADA ‘VOTER FRAUD’</p>
    <p>The Trump cam­paign was sched­uled to hold a press con­fer­ence yes­ter­day in Las Ve­gas to an­nounce the fil­ing of a law­suit al­leg­ing that at least 10,000 peo­ple voted il­le­gally in Ne­vada, Fox News re­ported.</p>
