    <p>LON­DON • It was not that long ago when As­ton Villa were fight­ing a rel­e­ga­tion bat­tle last sea­son but they have now moved into the Premier League top four after strolling to a 3-0 win at Ful­ham on Mon­day.</p>
    <p>Goals from Jack Gre­al­ish, Conor Houri­hane and Ty­rone Mings sealed the points in a lop­sided con­test at Craven Cot­tage.</p>
    <p>The re­sult left Villa fourth on a max­i­mum six points from two games, while pro­moted Ful­ham are rooted to the bot­tom with no points after a third suc­ces­sive de­feat.</p>
    <p>Villa boss Dean Smith was pleased with a per­for­mance which also saw his side keep a clean sheet for the first time in 27 away Premier League games since a 0-0 draw with West Bromwich Al­bion in Jan­uary 2016.</p>
    <p>“We scored some qual­ity goals,” he told Sky Sports.</p>
    <p>“On top of all that, you have to find the bal­ance in foot­ball, and that can be the de­sire to keep the ball out of the back of the net, and the play­ers have found that at the mo­ment.</p>
    <p>“John McGinn be­ing fit makes a mas­sive dif­fer­ence. He’s a fan­tas­tic player, and he was ter­rific tonight.”</p>
    <p>Villa dis­played clin­i­cal fin­ish­ing but their vic­tory was also made eas­ier by con­tin­ued sham­bolic de­fend­ing from Ful­ham, who have con­ceded 10 goals in their open­ing three matches and look out of their depth in the top flight.</p>
    <p>Gre­al­ish fired Villa ahead in the fourth minute when he took a sim­ple pass from McGinn into his stride and drilled a low shot past goal­keeper Alphonse Are­ola from a tight an­gle.</p>
    <p>Houri­hane dou­bled their lead in the 15th minute after a light­ningquick move down the left flank as McGinn racked up another as­sist when he teed up the Ire­land mid­fielder to side-foot the ball into the bot­tom corner.</p>
    <p>The match was over as a con­test in the 48th minute when Villa’s Eng­land cen­tre-back Mings ghosted into the penalty area and turned in a cross from the left with Ful­ham’s de­fend­ers po­si­tioned like stat­ues.</p>
    <p>The home team’s man­ager Scott Parker rued their poor de­fend­ing.</p>
    <p>“I’ve stood in this po­si­tion for the first three games and it’s a com­mon theme of what I’m say­ing. You can’t give up goals like we are, I’ve high­lighted it and we know where we are,” he said.</p>
    <p>“It’s tough to fix the de­fen­sive frail­ties. I went with a back five to­day just to maybe give us a bit more so­lid­ity and it didn’t work ob­vi­ously.”</p>
