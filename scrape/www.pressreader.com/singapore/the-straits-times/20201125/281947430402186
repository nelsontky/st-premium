    <p>Thai po­lice will de­ploy nearly 6,000 of­fi­cers today at the of­fice that man­ages the royal for­tune as the king­dom braces it­self for a demon­stra­tion by pro­test­ers de­mand­ing that King Maha Va­ji­ra­longkorn give up per­sonal con­trol of the as­sets.</p>
    <p>Po­lice said yes­ter­day that no pro­test­ers would be al­lowed within 150m of the Crown Prop­erty Bureau, where roy­al­ists have also said they plan to gather in de­fence of a monar­chy that faces its big­gest chal­lenge in decades.</p>
    <p>Mr Piya Tavichai, the deputy head of Bangkok po­lice, said the two groups would be kept apart. “De­pend­ing on how pro­test­ers be­have, we will take ap­pro­pri­ate mea­sures,” he told a news con­fer­ence.</p>
    <p>More than 50 peo­ple were hurt last week when po­lice used wa­ter can­non and tear gas against thou­sands of pro­test­ers at Par­lia­ment, in the most vi­o­lent day of more than four months of ral­lies.</p>
    <p>Pro­test­ers are seek­ing the re­moval of for­mer junta leader and now Prime Min­is­ter Prayut Chano-cha and want a new Con­sti­tu­tion, but have also bro­ken taboos by de­mand­ing re­forms to curb the pow­ers of the King. One of the demon­stra­tors’ de­mands is the re­ver­sal of changes that gave the King per­sonal con­trol over a royal for­tune val­ued in the tens of bil­lions of dol­lars.</p>
    <p>The Free Youth protest group said in a Twit­ter post that it would demon­strate today to “re­claim the prop­erty that is meant to be­long to the peo­ple”.</p>
    <p>The Royal Palace has made no com­ment since the protests be­gan, al­though the King had said the pro­test­ers were loved “all the same”.</p>
    <p>Mr Prayut has re­jected the calls to re­sign.</p>
