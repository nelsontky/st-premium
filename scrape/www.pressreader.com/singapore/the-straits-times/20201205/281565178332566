    <p>The slump in re­tail sales eased in Oc­to­ber, although most seg­ments still reg­is­tered dou­ble-digit de­cline, ac­cord­ing to data re­leased by the Depart­ment of Statis­tics yes­ter­day. Tak­ings at the till dropped 8.6 per cent com­pared with Oc­to­ber last year, an im­prove­ment from the re­vised 10.7 per cent fall in Septem­ber.</p>
    <p>The slump in re­tail sales eased in Oc­to­ber, although most seg­ments still reg­is­tered dou­ble-digit de­cline, ac­cord­ing to data re­leased by the Depart­ment of Statis­tics yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Tak­ings at the till dropped 8.6 per cent com­pared with Oc­to­ber last year, an im­prove­ment from the re­vised 10.7 per cent fall in Septem­ber.</p>
    <p>Ex­clud­ing motor ve­hi­cles, the de­cline was larger, at 11.2 per cent.</p>
    <p>But when com­pared with the pre­vi­ous month, sea­son­ally ad­justed re­tail sales in Oc­to­ber posted a slight growth of 0.2 per cent.</p>
    <p>Ms Se­lena Ling, OCBC Bank head of trea­sury re­search and strat­egy, said: “There is some glim­mer of light at the end of the tun­nel with the month-on-month im­prove­ment, but still quite dis­tant for now.</p>
    <p>“I do not ex­pect re­tail sales to re­vert to pos­i­tive year-on-year growth ter­ri­tory till early 2021, pos­si­bly around Chi­nese New Year in February. Sec­ond-quar­ter re­tail sales for next year will also likely see a big jump due to the very low base this year.”</p>
    <p>May­bank Kim Eng an­a­lyst Chua</p>
    <p>Hak Bin noted that re­tail sales are stag­nat­ing at about a tenth be­low pre-pan­demic lev­els, af­ter re­bound­ing from the lows dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker pe­riod.</p>
    <p>“The tun­nel is still a long one as the vac­cine will likely only be widely avail­able in the sec­ond quar­ter at the ear­li­est,” he said.</p>
    <p>On a year-on-year ba­sis, most re­tail in­dus­tries still con­tin­ued to reg­is­ter declines.</p>
    <p>The slump in tak­ings was led by food and al­co­hol, where sales fell by 44.7 per cent, fol­lowed by depart­ment stores which saw tak­ings drop by 35.2 per cent.</p>
    <p>Re­tail­ers of cos­met­ics, toi­letries and med­i­cal goods saw sales fall by 30 per cent, while wear­ing ap­parel and footwear tak­ings also slid, by 26.3 per cent.</p>
    <p>Sales of watches and jew­ellery, com­puter and telecom­mu­ni­ca­tions equip­ment, and op­ti­cal goods and books also tum­bled.</p>
    <p>But sales at su­per­mar­kets and hy­per­mar­kets con­tin­ued to rise, by 22.3 per cent.</p>
    <p>Re­tail­ers of fur­ni­ture and house­hold equip­ment also saw in­creased sales of 12.5 per cent, while recre­ational goods tak­ings rose by 9.8 per cent.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, sales of food and bev­er­age ser­vices fell 23.5 per cent.</p>
    <p>Food cater­ers again led the fall in sales, with a plunge of 76.4 per cent. Restau­rants saw tak­ings drop by 26.2 per cent. Cafes, food­courts and other eat­ing places, and fast food out­lets also saw dips in sales.</p>
    <p>The to­tal sales value of food and bev­er­age ser­vices in Oc­to­ber was es­ti­mated at $692 mil­lion. On­line sales made up about 19.7 per cent.</p>
    <p>Ms Ling said: “Given that the Sin­gapoRedis­cov­ers Vouch­ers are meant more for do­mes­tic tourism in the form of stay­ca­tions and tourism at­trac­tions, they may have lim­ited im­pact on re­tail sales per se.</p>
    <p>“That said, Sin­ga­pore­ans are largely stuck here for the fes­tive sea­son, so there may be a bit of ‘bore­dom’ spend­ing go­ing on in terms of F&B and shop­ping.”</p>
    <p>The over­all es­ti­mated to­tal re­tail sales value was about $3.3 bil­lion, of which on­line re­tail sales made up about 10.5 per cent.</p>
    <p>This trend of on­line buy­ing is es­pe­cially ev­i­dent for com­puter and telecom­mu­ni­ca­tions equip­ment, where dig­i­tal tak­ings made up al­most half of the to­tal tak­ings.</p>
    <p>Ms Ling added: “On­line sales are def­i­nitely the way to go and will con­tinue to grow over time. Con­sumer pref­er­ence has been shift­ing rapidly to e-com­merce and was fur­ther ac­cel­er­ated by Covid-19, so the pres­sure is on re­tail­ers, in­clud­ing depart­ment stores, to con­tinue to re­vamp their busi­ness mod­els.”</p>
