    <p>Grow­ing some fruit and veg for the kitchen ta­ble is hard enough what with pesky in­sects and pests, but com­mu­nity gar­den­ers have an even more in­fu­ri­at­ing foe to con­tend with – thieves snitch­ing pro­duce and dig­ging up en­tire plants.</p>
    <p>This has been hap­pen­ing since the com­mu­nity plots were in­tro­duced around 15 years ago. Most gar­den­ers can put up with peo­ple tak­ing a few cut­tings or leaves but they draw the line at rip­ping off plants and steal­ing fruit.</p>
    <p>In­ci­dents have con­tin­ued un­abated de­spite new de­ter­rents.</p>
    <p>Th­ese in­clude com­mu­nity groups erect­ing signs re­mind­ing the public not to pluck ed­i­bles with­out ask­ing and cov­er­ing rarer plants with nets.</p>
    <p>But thefts still hap­pen in each garden at least once a month.</p>
    <p>Home­maker Cas­san­dra Ho, 52, who grows ed­i­bles in a com­mu­nity garden in Bis­han-Ang Mo Kio Park, said that petty theft is an un­for­tu­nate re­al­ity.</p>
    <p>“My neigh­bours who look for­ward to har­vest­ing their big and ripened jack­fruit, pa­payas and win­ter melon will find them gone the next day,” she said. “We try to help to look out for each other’s plots and make sure we don’t see sus­pi­cious peo­ple loi­ter­ing around the plots.”</p>
    <p>Gar­den­ers said mis­chief is preva­lent in the mid­dle of the night and early morn­ing, but some thefts have oc­curred right under their noses.</p>
    <p>Last week, full-time gar­dener Ray­mond Tang, 45, who has a plot in the So­cial In­no­va­tion Park in Pung­gol, spot­ted a woman pluck­ing some of his blue pea flow­ers. “She apol­o­gised and said she saw no one to ap­proach for per­mis­sion be­fore pluck­ing. I told her if no one was around, she should have left the plants alone.”</p>
    <p>A num­ber of com­mu­nity gar­dens have fenc­ing or are locked but peo­ple can sneak in when they are open.</p>
    <p>“Some­times, the cul­prits can be the gar­den­ers also, es­pe­cially if they want to grow veg­gies quickly, in­stead of start­ing from the seeds,” noted Ms Ho.</p>
    <p>Gardening en­thu­si­ast Alex Ng, 48, re­fuses to use com­mu­nity and al­lot­ment plots be­cause he is wor­ried about theft, as he has seen such in­ci­dents men­tioned on so­cial me­dia.</p>
    <p>The pas­try chef is an ex­per­i­men­tal</p>
    <p>GAR­DEN­ERS STAY WATCH­FUL My neigh­bours who look for­ward to har­vest­ing their big and ripened jack­fruit, pa­payas and win­ter melon will find them gone the next day. We try to help to look out for each other’s plots and make sure we don’t see sus­pi­cious peo­ple loi­ter­ing around ’’ the plots. HOME­MAKER CAS­SAN­DRA HO, 52, who grows ed­i­bles in a com­mu­nity garden in Bis­han-Ang Mo Kio Park.</p>
    <p>gar­dener who grows chal­leng­ing plants such as black­berry, fig and lon­gan, and he does not want them to be stolen. In­stead, he rents a pri­vate plot for $400 a month in a farm area near Sem­bawang.</p>
    <p>Com­mu­nity garden theft cases are rarely re­ported to the au­thor­i­ties.</p>
    <p>“We choose to talk and ex­plain to the per­son, if we know who he or she is. We don’t bring it up to the MP or po­lice,” said re­tiree Frankie Tan, 55, who is also a Com­mu­nity in Bloom (CIB) am­bas­sador.</p>
    <p>CIB am­bas­sadors are vol­un­teers under the Na­tional Parks Board (NParks) who help to set up com­mu­nity gar­dens.</p>
    <p>But a man who stole nine bon­sai plants worth $12,400 from Yuhua Com­mu­nity Cen­tre and a Res­i­dents’ Cor­ner Garden in Jurong East was jailed for 12 months in 2016.</p>
    <p>There are 1,500 com­mu­nity gar­dens and 1,100 al­lot­ment gar­dens is­land­wide. By 2030, NParks aims to more than dou­ble the num­ber of gar­dens, but gar­den­ers are not con­vinced that theft will end with more plots be­ing set up.</p>
    <p>“This is an is­sue with peo­ple’s mind­set and men­tal­ity. If some peo­ple are lazy to grow plants, they take the easy way out,” said Mr Tang.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, com­mu­nity gar­den­ers have come up with cre­ative and gen­er­ous ways to pre­vent theft.</p>
    <p>“A few gar­den­ers in Bis­han will wrap their pa­payas in cloth or take them home to ripen. We have to be faster than the per­son who wants to grab them,” said Ms Ho.</p>
    <p>She ran­domly tosses pa­paya seeds to other plots to pre­vent theft within the garden, say­ing: “When oth­ers have what you have, the ten­dency to take will not be high. That is my strat­egy.”</p>
