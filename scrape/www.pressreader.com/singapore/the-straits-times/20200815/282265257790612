    <p>It was like a gift from heaven for jockey Mark Ewe ear­lier this week.</p>
    <p>From out of the blue, the former three-time top ap­pren­tice re­ceived a sur­prise call from the cir­cuit’s other Mark, Sin­ga­pore’s three-time cham­pion trainer Walker, of­fer­ing the ride on his sole Kranji Mile con­tender, Yu­long Edi­tion.</p>
    <p>A six-time win­ner, the Yu Long Sta­ble-owned Ir­ish-bred is not with­out any hope in the $1 mil­lion Group 1 Kranji show­piece in Race 12 to­mor­row. With luck, the five-yearold chest­nut geld­ing could give Ewe his first taste of Group suc­cess.</p>
    <p>Track-siders did a dou­ble take on Wed­nes­day morn­ing, when Ewe, in his dis­tinct yel­low cap and white vest, was seen work­ing a cou­ple of Walker’s horses.</p>
    <p>This is be­cause Walker had not nom­i­nated Ewe on his horses, ex­cept for just one oc­ca­sion.</p>
    <p>That was on July 15, 2018, when Ewe re­placed Walker’s ap­pren­tice jockey, Zawari Razali, on Why Ports in an Open Maiden race. They fin­ished un­placed.</p>
    <p>In charge of a big op­er­a­tion after re­lo­cat­ing from New Zealand to Sin­ga­pore in 2009, Walker has al­ways re­lied on cer­tain ex­pa­tri­ate jock­eys or his own ap­pren­tice jock­eys.</p>
    <p>Ewe, who honed his craft in Perth un­der his former master Charles Leck’s spon­sor­ship, en­joys the bulk of his sup­port from lo­cal train­ers like David Kok and Young Keah Yong.</p>
    <p>So, it came as a sur­prise that Walker di­alled Ewe’s num­ber to of­fer the ride on Yu­long Edi­tion.</p>
    <p>It could also be due to the cur­rent coron­avirus-in­duced short­age of jock­eys that this came into be­ing.</p>
    <p>Walker ex­plained that the Kranji Mile is a Group 1 race and he didn’t want an ap­pren­tice jockey for the horse, even though his ap­pren­tice jockey Hakim Ka­marud­din is rid­ing on the crest of a wave. Hakim rode a tre­ble last Satur­day.</p>
    <p>“I wanted a senior rider and Mark is a former three-time Sin­ga­pore cham­pion ap­pren­tice jockey who’s now a full-fledged jockey. It’s just that he doesn’t get many op­por­tu­ni­ties these days,” said Walker.</p>
    <p>“I’ve never booked Mark be­fore, but one day, he rode one of my horses after the rider was stood down. I can’t re­mem­ber the horse, but I know he didn’t win.”</p>
    <p>Ewe has no rec­ol­lec­tion of the race ei­ther, but he hopes this gift ride al­most two years later will be a lot more mem­o­rable.</p>
    <p>“Mark called me on Tues­day morn­ing and asked me if I had any ride in the Kranji Mile.</p>
    <p>When he gave me the ride on Yu­long Edi­tion, I said yes straight away,” said the Pe­nang-born jockey, who has five other mounts for train­ers Kok, Young and Ja­son Lim.</p>
    <p>“I thought I al­ready had a nice book of rides for Sun­day, one of the best I’ve had for a long time.</p>
    <p>“Things have not gone very well for me this year, be­fore and after Covid-19. I was rid­ing slow horses, most of my own­ers’ horses were get­ting old and couldn’t even go to Malaysia, and the new ones are now stuck in Aus­tralia and New Zealand.</p>
    <p>“The best chance I had was Mr Fat Kiddy, and he ran a close sec­ond (Feb 21). So, to get this call from Mark from out of nowhere, I was so happy.</p>
    <p>“Mark is a nice guy, but I never dared ask him for rides be­fore, as I know he al­ready had his rid­ers. But things have changed now. It’s my first book­ing for him, but also my first ride in a Group 1 race. I can’t thank Mark and the own­ers enough.</p>
    <p>“I’ve never won any Group race in my ca­reer; such op­por­tu­ni­ties are hard to come by. It would be a dream come true to win a first Group 1 race at my first try. But I know it won’t be easy.”</p>
    <p>Ewe reck­oned to­mor­row’s race is quite open and that Yu­long Edi­tion is drawn wide (No. 14) in the ca­pac­ity field of 16.</p>
    <p>“I know my horse goes to the front and the wide draw doesn’t help. But I’ll wait for Mark to give me the in­struc­tions on how to ride him on Sun­day. I gal­loped the horse and he worked well. I’m go­ing in with no pres­sure – just take it easy and try my best.</p>
    <p>“Hope­fully, this can lead to more sup­port from Mark in the fu­ture. But let’s take one race at a time.”</p>
    <p>Walker’s ap­praisal of Yu­long Edi­tion will boost Ewe’s con­fi­dence.</p>
    <p>“Yu­long Edi­tion has im­proved out of sight after his last run,” said Walker .“Take out Count of mon­te­cristo from the Kranji Mile, and it’s a very even field. It be­comes a bit of a guess­ing game.”</p>
