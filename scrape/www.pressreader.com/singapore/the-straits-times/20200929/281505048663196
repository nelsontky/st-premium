    <p>My Aus­tralian son-in-law and I play a yearly ten­nis cham­pi­onship for the prize of but­ter chicken and brag­ging rights. Alas I have beaten him only once, in Sin­ga­pore, on a hu­mid day when he, 20 years younger, wilted like a hy­drangea in the heat. He was red-faced, huff­ing and close to throw­ing up. It was a beau­ti­ful sight.</p>
    <p>He took it like a man and com­plained about the con­di­tions for only six months. But in truth he un­der­stood: This is part of sport, these mad vari­ables, this home ad­van­tage, this capri­cious weather.</p>
    <p>Foot­ballers play in the snow and else­where the wind tames tal­ent. On a mean, blus­tery third day at the 2002 Bri­tish Open, Tiger Woods – he’d won the year’s first two Ma­jors</p>
    <p>– found him­self hit­ting a two-iron at a hole where he’d nor­mally use a seven-iron. He shot an 81.</p>
    <p>But, hey, a lit­tle dis­com­fort is a lovely thing, which is why it’s called out­door sport. You play a ri­val but also what­ever Zeus – Greek god of the sky – hurls at you. Ev­ery­thing is rel­a­tive any­way. Af­ter some early rain chaos at the Tour de France, Nor­we­gian Alexan­der Kristoff said: “Ev­ery­body was crash­ing around but I told my­self it was eas­ier than rid­ing on ice in Nor­way.”</p>
    <p>At the French Open, there’s al­ready whin­ing about the cold, the rain and heavy balls and there’s noth­ing quite like the sound of mil­lion­aires grip­ing. Vic­to­ria Azarenka groused “I live in Florida, I am used to hot weather” while men wore leg­gings and it wasn’t a fash­ion state­ment. Ad­mit­tedly this is more shiv­er­ing Slam than sum­mer one, but first-round losers earn $96,000 and surely that’s worth a lit­tle in­con­ve­nience.</p>
    <p>In­dia’s Somdev Dev­var­man, a for­mer world No. 62 who knows the slid­ing arts of Roland Gar­ros clay, has some sym­pa­thy. All the stop­ping and start­ing in the cold, he says, a se­ries of ath­letic points fol­lowed by sit­ting down at changeover­s, tests the body. Se­condly, in over­cast con­di­tions, the balls play heav­ier. Add the fact that play­ers haven’t com­peted a lot this year, and it’s un­der­stand­able that “they’re scared of in­juries”.</p>
    <p>Yet he’ll also say, “the play­ers don’t re­ally have a right to com­plain about the weather. At this point you should be grate­ful there is a tour­na­ment in the first place.”</p>
    <p>Other ath­letes are un­likely to com­mis­er­ate, for at least ten­nis folk who get on cen­tre court have a roof to whine un­der. Run­ners are scarcely so lucky. The 1976 Bos­ton Marathon was called the “Run for the Hoses” be­cause passers-by helped out com­peti­tors in the 38 deg C heat by hos­ing them down.</p>
    <p>Ath­letes are con­trol freaks but the weather can’t be com­manded. It plays hell with pre­ci­sion and ru­ins the mood. But fans don’t mind for there is a sly plea­sure to this. Speck­led with vomit, does an over­heated player have any­thing left? We want to see them dig and they do.</p>
    <p>Hu­man ver­sus na­ture is a spir­ited scrap and ev­ery ath­lete has a tale. In Bei­jing last year, it’s 10-12 deg C and Jas­mine Ser is freez­ing dur­ing a ri­fle event in the 50m out­door range. “My fin­gers wouldn’t re­act, they just don’t lis­ten to you.” Shoot­ing and shiv­er­ing is a bad mar­riage but, she says, “you have to deal with it”.</p>
    <p>Open-wa­ter swim­mer Chan­tal Liew knows the feel­ing, for dur­ing the 2017 SEA Games, she says, “we swam in 32-33 Cel­sius wa­ter and my in­ter­nal body tem­per­a­ture hit around 41 which is po­ten­tially very dan­ger­ous”. Dur­ing hot race days she has lost 1.5kg, had “su­per bad” headaches and takes “about a week to fully re­cover”.</p>
    <p>Ath­letes en­dure and adapt as lessons are learnt about at­ti­tude and at­tire. At the World Univer­sity Archery Cham­pi­onship in</p>
    <p>Mon­go­lia in 2016, says archer Contessa Loh, the weather abruptly turned “from 20-some­thing de­grees to be­low 10”. Ex­cept all she had were thin track pants, a light jacket and short-sleeved shirts.</p>
    <p>“I was shiv­er­ing and it made aim­ing so much harder. It was very men­tally ex­haust­ing.” Now, just in case, she packs warm clothes.</p>
    <p>Now there are heat rules, ice baths and a sci­en­tific pam­per­ing un­known to older ath­letes. This week cricket is mourn­ing the death of Aus­tralian Dean Jones, whose heroic, out­ra­geous 210 in hu­mid Chen­nai in In­dia in 1986 is one of cricket’s un­for­get­table sto­ries.</p>
    <p>He told es­p­n­cricinfo in 2013 that “I know nearly ev­ery shot in ev­ery in­nings I played. I can’t re­mem­ber a thing af­ter 120 in that in­nings”. He threw up 15 times, uri­nated in his pants but kept go­ing. “It wouldn’t hap­pen now,” he said, “be­cause of liti­gious play­ers and work­place safety. Should we be play­ing in 42 de­grees?”</p>
    <p>In that in­ter­view, Jones never used the words “brave” or “tough” and yet he em­bod­ied the de­fi­ance of the great ath­lete. This was his job, this was what he wanted to do all his life. It’s also what the ten­nis play­ers in Paris will even­tu­ally do. Just sol­dier on, prefer­ably silently. And keep their cool in the cold.</p>
    <p>Ath­letes are con­trol freaks but the weather can’t be com­manded. It plays hell with pre­ci­sion and ru­ins the mood. But fans don’t mind for there is a sly plea­sure to this. Speck­led with vomit, does an over­heated player have any­thing left? We want to see them dig and they do.</p>
