    <p>A man has been charged with at­tempted mur­der af­ter a woman was found in­jured on Wed­nes­day.</p>
    <p>Lim Song Chua, 59, who was charged in hos­pi­tal yes­ter­day, is ac­cused of try­ing to kill Ms Heng Hwee Chay, 48.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to court doc­u­ments, the Sin­ga­porean al­legedly choked her with both hands and slashed her with a knife.</p>
    <p>He is ac­cused of com­mit­ting the of­fence in a unit at the Tanam­era Crest con­do­minium in Pari Dedap Walk, near New Up­per Changi Road, be­tween 10pm on Tues­day and 8am on Wed­nes­day.</p>
    <p>A search on the Reg­istry of Mar­riages web­site re­veals that the pair are not mar­ried to each other. Another on­line search re­vealed that they do not own the apart­ment.</p>
    <p>The po­lice said in an ear­lier state­ment that of­fi­cers re­ceived a call for as­sis­tance about the case at around 8am on Wed­nes­day.</p>
    <p>When the po­lice ar­rived at the scene, they found Ms Heng wounded on the floor out­side the unit. She was taken con­scious to hos­pi­tal and her con­di­tion was sta­ble.</p>
    <p>Pre­lim­i­nary in­ves­ti­ga­tions found that Lim and Ms Heng know each other. Of­fi­cers later ar­rested him in­side the apart­ment.</p>
    <p>Lim’s case has been ad­journed to next Thurs­day. If con­victed of at­tempted mur­der, he can be ei­ther jailed for life or jailed for up to 20 years and fined.</p>
