    <p>Lit­tle is known about the per­sonal life of Dick­son Yeo, the Sin­ga­porean who made head­lines re­cently for plead­ing guilty to spy­ing for China in the United States. But foot­prints in cy­berspace left by him in the past decade pro­vide a glimpse into his child­hood, per­sonal con­vic­tions and po­lit­i­cal views, such as how he por­trayed him­self as a Sinophile in dozens of posts on Quora.</p>
    <p>Lit­tle is known about the per­sonal life of Dick­son Yeo, the Sin­ga­porean who made head­lines re­cently for plead­ing guilty to spy­ing for China in the United States.</p>
    <p>His former Na­tional Ju­nior Col­lege class­mates and peers at the Lee Kuan Yew School of Pub­lic Pol­icy, where he en­rolled in 2015 as a PhD stu­dent in the Pub­lic Pol­icy pro­gramme, have re­mained tightlippe­d on their in­ter­ac­tions with him af­ter news broke that he was re­cruited by Chi­nese in­tel­li­gence op­er­a­tives to ob­tain valu­able in­for­ma­tion from the US.</p>
    <p>Those who were con­tacted by The Straits Times ei­ther did not re­spond or de­clined to com­ment.</p>
    <p>But foot­prints in cy­berspace left by the 39-year-old in the past decade pro­vide a glimpse into his child­hood, per­sonal con­vic­tions and po­lit­i­cal views.</p>
    <p>THE OUT­SPO­KEN SINOPHILE</p>
    <p>On July 24, Yeo ad­mit­ted in a fed­eral court in Wash­ing­ton to spy­ing for China. He did that by set­ting up a fake po­lit­i­cal con­sul­tancy as a cover to tar­get Amer­i­can mil­i­tary and gov­ern­ment em­ploy­ees with se­cu­rity clear­ances.</p>
    <p>Be­sides trawl­ing on pro­fes­sional net­work­ing site LinkedIn to re­cruit such in­di­vid­u­als, Yeo was ac­tive on ques­tion-and-an­swer site Quora, with more than 200 posts be­tween 2014 and last year.</p>
    <p>He fre­quently com­mented on on­line news sites such as cur­rent af­fairs magazine The Diplo­mat and China-cen­tric news blog Shang­hai­ist from as far back as 10 years ago.</p>
    <p>Some of the posts on Quora ap­peared to be quiet mus­ings about life, while oth­ers were con­fi­dent con­fronta­tions against fel­low Quora users.</p>
    <p>Some were sim­ply an out­pour­ing of ad­mi­ra­tion for China.</p>
    <p>Yeo, a self-styled scholar on East Asia and the re­gion, un­abashedly por­trayed him­self as a Sinophile in dozens of posts, fre­quently re­spond­ing to ques­tions re­lat­ing to Chi­nese his­tory.</p>
    <p>To some who he thought had dis­played mis­con­cep­tions about China, Yeo would re­spond with marked im­pa­tience.</p>
    <p>When some­one asked if peo­ple would have to “suf­fer again... To civilise the Chi­nese if they rise to dom­i­nance in the world”, Yeo said: “China has been civilised for at least 5,000 years. When you mean ‘civilise’, you ac­tu­ally meant ‘colonise’ right?”</p>
    <p>To an­other ques­tion – “Why is China keen on throw­ing away Pak­istan and tak­ing Iran?” – Yeo snapped back: “Where on Earth do you peo­ple get this in­for­ma­tion?”</p>
    <p>In an­other rant di­rected at a Quora user, he wrote: “Sin­ga­pore can’t move out of Asean and Asia. And as Wash­ing­ton be­comes in­creas­ingly con­fused about its place in the world, that means we have to en­gage and em­brace the Chi­nese eco­nomic rise more than ever be­fore. I re­ally don’t care what sort of lo­calised pro­pa­ganda you im­bibe.”</p>
    <p>Yeo, who wrote that he had stud­ied at River Val­ley High School in his youth, seemed proud of mod­ern China, de­scrib­ing the coun­try as “buoy­ant, en­thu­si­as­tic, at times iras­ci­ble and ex­tremely hard­work­ing” in one post.</p>
    <p>In a 2016 post on Quora, he listed his favourite things about the main­land Chi­nese.</p>
    <p>These in­cluded his ad­mi­ra­tion for their re­fusal to be de­feated in life; their abil­ity to with­stand racist taunts from “ev­ery­body in­clud­ing Sin­ga­porean Chi­nese”; their op­ti­mism in a bad global mar­ket at the time; and their will­ing­ness to ex­plore “when so many Sin­ga­pore­ans just want to stay home”.</p>
    <p>Apart from Chi­nese ide­ol­ogy, Yeo also had a pref­er­ence for their tech­nol­ogy – some of his self­ies posted on Face­book were taken with Xiaomi and Vivo mo­bile phones.</p>
    <p>LIVED IN BEI­JING</p>
    <p>Yet, de­spite his affin­ity for China,</p>
    <p>Yeo seemed to be prag­matic when it came to Sin­ga­pore’s re­la­tion­ship with China and the US.</p>
    <p>“We can’t be ‘pro-any­one’, we are a tiny coun­try on the edge of sev­eral em­pires. We are ‘pro-sur­vival’,” he wrote in re­sponse to a ques­tion on why Sin­ga­pore was not more pro-China than pro-US.</p>
    <p>Re­spond­ing to an­other ques­tion on why the Sin­ga­porean Chi­nese hated be­ing iden­ti­fied as Chi­nese, he said that, as a Sin­ga­porean Chi­nese, his state iden­tity was “as im­por­tant” as his ethnic iden­tity.</p>
    <p>Yeo also re­vealed on these on­line plat­forms that he be­gan liv­ing in Bei­jing “ex­ten­sively” from 2016 – which, ac­cord­ing to US prose­cu­tors, is a year af­ter he was re­cruited by Chi­nese in­tel­li­gence op­er­a­tives – and would travel fre­quently to Shang­hai to “tap the opin­ions of peo­ple in the main­land”.</p>
    <p>Court in­dict­ment pa­pers said Yeo started out targeting Asian coun­tries for his Chi­nese spy­mas­ters, be­fore turn­ing his sights on the US.</p>
    <p>Based on his LinkedIn pro­file, which was taken down last month, he vis­ited Bei­jing as a re­searcher at Pek­ing Univer­sity’s Na­tional In­sti­tute of Strate­gic Com­mu­ni­ca­tion be­tween June 2016 and Jan­uary last year.</p>
    <p>Prior to this, he had also lived in Tai­wan’s cap­i­tal, Taipei, in the mid­noughties, and in 2011 he moved to Ni­igata, Ja­pan, to pursue a master’s de­gree in in­ter­na­tional re­la­tions at the In­ter­na­tional Univer­sity of Ja­pan as a schol­ar­ship holder.</p>
    <p>EAR­LIER YEARS</p>
    <p>In var­i­ous posts, he men­tioned his ear­lier years. He of­ten em­pha­sised his hum­ble be­gin­nings, de­tail­ing how he grew up in the Pan­dan Loop area in West Coast, and that his par­ents did not re­ceive any for­mal ed­u­ca­tion when they were chil­dren in ru­ral Lim Chu Kang.</p>
    <p>He re­counted how, at eight years old, he ex­pe­ri­enced the “most hu­mil­i­at­ing” in­ci­dent while din­ing at a pop­u­lar fast-food chain with his “rich rel­a­tives”.</p>
    <p>Yeo said in the 2017 post that he had been eye­ing a burger af­ter wit­ness­ing his aunt gen­er­ously or­der­ing a large por­tion of burg­ers and fries for his cousins.</p>
    <p>“My mom glared but the aunt rushed to the counter to pick it out for me,” he wrote.</p>
    <p>“My mom is a proud woman and she wouldn’t let my aunt do it. If you’re Chi­nese, this is one of those night­mare sce­nar­ios, when peo­ple don’t want to seem less well-to-do com­pared with their other kin.”</p>
    <p>Af­ter pick­ing out a “ba­sic cheese­burger”, Yeo said, his mother searched her purse for coins, while his aunt stepped in to of­fer to foot the bill.</p>
    <p>“In the end, we got rid of the pickles and asked for (the price) to be dropped by a dol­lar,” he wrote.</p>
    <p>The meal, he said, ended up be­ing</p>
    <p>“pretty mis­er­able”, with his mother fum­ing when they left.</p>
    <p>Yeo wrote of the ef­fect the in­ci­dent had on him: “I still don’t eat cheese­burg­ers, not even the Asian hip­ster gourmet types.”</p>
    <p>He also posted about an­other in­ci­dent where he seemed to have re­sented his sta­tus in life.</p>
    <p>He claimed to have dropped out of law school and said his first job was be­ing a tu­tor to “rich kids” in 2004, which in­cluded teach­ing math­e­mat­ics and English to a priv­i­leged 17-year-old who lived in a bun­ga­low in western Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>Yeo re­called in the 2017 post – which was his most pop­u­lar on Quora with more than 130,000 views – that the teenager owned mas­sage chairs and a gam­ing rig, while he him­self could barely af­ford his school fees.</p>
    <p>He wrote that he cried af­ter an ar­gu­ment with the stu­dent, who he claimed had taunted him.</p>
    <p>“One of his mas­sage chairs could have paid for a se­mes­ter of tuition at Columbia (which I had got­ten into but couldn’t af­ford as a for­eigner),” Yeo posted.</p>
    <p>While he pro­vided few de­tails about his im­me­di­ate fam­ily, Yeo ap­par­ently had a lot of ad­mi­ra­tion for his par­ents. He men­tioned them in a num­ber of posts and spoke about how he would take care of them fi­nan­cially.</p>
    <p>Asked what he would do if he had a bil­lion dol­lars, Yeo replied that he would set up a trust fund for his par­ents with a monthly in­come of US$7,000 (S$9,600) per per­son, and a “nett in­vest­ment of US$2 mil­lion per parent with a 10 year cap”.</p>
    <p>In an­other post, he also said that if he could wish for any­thing in the world, he would ask for his par­ents to live “how­ever they wish with as much re­sources as they needed for the rest of their lives”.</p>
    <p>His on­line writ­ings touched on other mat­ters.</p>
    <p>In his ad­vice to an un­em­ployed grad­u­ate who claimed to en­ter­tain thoughts of sui­cide as he had no money for a master’s de­gree, Yeo wrote: “It gets bet­ter. Noth­ing is worth killing your­self for. Debt can be man­aged.”</p>
    <p>He also claimed that the ed­u­ca­tion sys­tem and work­ing life in Sin­ga­pore were stress­ful and fast­paced, be­cause “be­ing poor in Sin­ga­pore is like be­ing in prison”.</p>
    <p>In July 2017, he asked an anony­mous ne­ti­zen, who iden­ti­fied him­self as a mecha­tronic en­gi­neer keen on data science, to add him on LinkedIn. The per­son had com­plained that he had trou­ble find­ing work in Aus­tralia.</p>
    <p>“Google the IDA (In­fo­comm De­vel­op­ment Author­ity), the Prime Min­is­ter’s Of­fice or the Na­tional Pop­u­la­tion Tal­ent Divi­sion in Sin­ga­pore,” wrote Yeo, promis­ing to help the en­gi­neer ex­pand his net­work.</p>
    <p>“Your sort of tal­ent should never go to waste.”</p>
    <p>Yeo’s Face­book ac­count re­vealed that he prob­a­bly smoked (Camel Crush men­thols) and seemed to have a pen­chant for mid-range lux­ury watches. In one photo taken at Fuller­ton Bay, he sported what looked like a black ce­ramic Pan­erai watch.</p>
    <p>Yeo, with his trade­mark pom­padour, square-rimmed glasses and a slight paunch, had no qualms post­ing photos of him­self on so­cial me­dia. He is neatly groomed in many photos, but in a selfie taken in a ho­tel room, he wore a pair of busi­ness trousers that were clearly too long, with an over­sized coat that did not match his pants.</p>
    <p>Spies like Yeo are taught to cre­ate dif­fer­ent per­sonas to bait po­ten­tial tar­gets, ob­servers have pointed out.</p>
    <p>The Sin­ga­pore au­thor­i­ties have said that Yeo did not pose a threat to the Repub­lic. It is known that he had tried to join a sen­si­tive gov­ern­ment agency here, but failed to do so.</p>
    <p>Yeo, who now faces a max­i­mum jail sen­tence of 10 years, is sched­uled to be sen­tenced in the US on Oct 9.</p>
    <p>WE ARE PRO-SUR­VIVAL</p>
    <p>We can’t be ‘pro-any­one’, we are a tiny coun­try on the edge of sev­eral em­pires. We are ‘pro-sur­vival’.</p>
