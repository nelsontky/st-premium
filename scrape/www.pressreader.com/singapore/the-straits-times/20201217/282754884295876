    <p>• Four months af­ter his death shocked the world, trail-blaz­ing Amer­i­can ac­tor Chad­wick Bose­man makes his heart­break­ing, hotly Os­car-tipped fi­nal film ap­pear­ance in 1920s blues drama, Ma Rainey’s Black Bot­tom.</p>
    <p>The Black Pan­ther (2018) star por­trays a feisty, ir­rev­er­ent horn player strug­gling to make him­self heard in a Chicago mu­sic world rid­dled with racism and ex­ploita­tion, in the Au­gust Wil­son play adap­ta­tion out to­mor­row on Net­flix.</p>
    <p>Bose­man’s role as the piece’s tragic hero takes on added poignancy by his death at age 43 in Au­gust this year from colon can­cer – a di­ag­no­sis he never pub­licly dis­cussed or even shared with his costars dur­ing pro­duc­tion.</p>
    <p>He had se­cretly bat­tled through his can­cer di­ag­no­sis to be­come the first black star with his own su­per­hero epic in the record-break­ing Marvel fran­chise.</p>
    <p>Black Pan­ther was nom­i­nated for Best Pic­ture at the Os­cars and grossed more than US$1 bil­lion (S$1.3 bil­lion) world­wide. Last week, Dis­ney paid tribute to Bose­man by an­nounc­ing that his iconic role as T’Challa will not be re­cast in the se­quel.</p>
    <p>In his fi­nal film, Bose­man’s cor­net player Levee has been hired to sup­port “Mother of the Blues” Ma Rainey, who has trav­elled from the Deep South to record her hit songs on a swel­ter­ing sum­mer af­ter­noon in a cramped back-al­ley stu­dio.</p>
    <p>As diva-es­que Rainey bat­tles du­plic­i­tous pro­duc­ers who want to cash in on her voice and send her pack­ing, Levee plots his own path to solo mu­si­cal glory while re­veal­ing a child­hood rav­aged by white bru­tal­ity.</p>
    <p>In a bravura per­for­mance, Bose­man de­liv­ers sear­ing mono­logues that vow to “make the white man re­spect me” and curse a god who “hates your black a**” – in­ter­spersed with mo­ments of imp­ish charisma, foot-shuf­fling dance moves and out­ra­geous flirt­ing.</p>
    <p>Amer­i­can ac­tress Vi­ola Davis, who plays the real-life Rainey, and di­rec­tor Ge­orge C. Wolfe have lit­tle doubt over Bose­man’s cre­den­tials to be­come the third post­hu­mous act­ing Os­car win­ner, af­ter Heath Ledger (2008’s The Dark Knight) and Peter Finch (1976’s Network.)</p>
    <p>“Chad­wick is my baby... (he) was just an artist,” Davis re­cently told jour­nal­ists.</p>
    <p>“Chad­wick put his en­tire be­ing into Levee... Levee de­mands that be­cause of the Her­culean scale of the role,” said Wolfe.</p>
    <p>“He put ev­ery ounce of his heart and pas­sion into it.”</p>
