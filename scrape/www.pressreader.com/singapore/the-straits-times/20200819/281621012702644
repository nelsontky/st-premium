    <p>The re­cent surge in cases in coun­tries that had man­aged to con­tain the Covid-19 pan­demic in its early months ac­tu­ally marks their move to a new phase for which they are better pre­pared, said a se­nior World Health Or­gan­i­sa­tion (WHO) of­fi­cial.</p>
    <p>Dr Takeshi Ka­sai, WHO’s re­gional di­rec­tor for the Western Pa­cific, said at a vir­tual press con­fer­ence yes­ter­day: “What we are ob­serv­ing is not sim­ply a resur­gence. We be­lieve it’s a sig­nal that we’ve en­tered a new phase of the pan­demic in the Asia-Pa­cific.</p>
    <p>“In this phase coun­tries are in­creas­ingly able to min­imise largescale dis­rup­tions to peo­ple’s lives and economies.”</p>
    <p>Coun­tries such as Ja­pan, Viet­nam South Korea and Aus­tralia had moved quickly to con­tain Covid-19 in the early months of the pan­demic, but are now fight­ing new surges.</p>
    <p>In some cases, the sec­ond wave is larger than the ini­tial out­breaks, said Dr Ka­sai.</p>
    <p>The surge in cases is due to coun­tries hav­ing re­laxed their ear­lier strin­gent mea­sures as they move towards re­open­ing their economies.</p>
    <p>He said these coun­tries “will need to deal with mul­ti­ple in­creases or surges, but in a sus­tain­able way”.</p>
    <p>They need to have “ear­lier tar­geted re­sponse” to pre­vent “big dis­rup­tions to the econ­omy and peo­ple’s life”.</p>
    <p>They should con­tinue to im­prove their health­care sys­tem and pro­tect the vul­ner­a­ble.</p>
    <p>And peo­ple in these coun­tries need to “main­tain their healthy be­haviour, not just pro­tect­ing them­selves, but also their fam­ily, com­mu­ni­ties”, while busi­nesses have to find ways to op­er­ate as they min­imise the risk of the virus spread­ing.</p>
    <p>Dr Ka­sai said: “By com­bin­ing early de­tec­tion and rapid re­sponse to emerg­ing in­fec­tions, and peo­ple stick­ing to the preven­tion mea­sures that are part of the new nor­mal, many (coun­tries) are now de­tect­ing out­breaks ear­lier and re­spond­ing to them faster, with more tar­geted in­ter­ven­tion.”</p>
    <p>This ag­ile ap­proach will help them to re­store their health sys­tems, so­ci­eties and economies.</p>
    <p>Dr Ka­sai added: “The di­rec­tion that the epi­demic now takes de­pends on the ac­tions of gov­ern­ments and peo­ple across the re­gion.”</p>
    <p>The WHO’s Western Pa­cific re­gion in­cludes China, Ja­pan, South Korea, Aus­tralia, Sin­ga­pore, In­done­sia and the Pa­cific is­land states, among oth­ers.</p>
    <p>Asked about moves by some coun­tries to open up for in­ter­na­tional travel, which has prac­ti­cally come to a stand­still, Dr Ka­sai said coun­tries should adopt “a risk-based ap­proach”. They need to look at where peo­ple are trav­el­ling to and from, and the sta­tus of the out­break in those coun­tries.</p>
    <p>Other con­sid­er­a­tions in­clude the kind of peo­ple who are com­ing into the coun­try, and the con­trols or in­ter­ven­tion that can be put in place.</p>
    <p>Dr Ka­sai said: “This re­quires con­tin­u­ous in­for­ma­tion shar­ing and as­sess­ment, and di­a­logue be­tween the coun­tries.”</p>
    <p>Mean­while, coun­tries plan­ning to open up “need to con­tinue to im­prove their sur­veil­lance sys­tem, and share that in­for­ma­tion”.</p>
    <p>They must come up with an agree­ment with the other coun­tries that al­low travel on how to man­age those who are trav­el­ling, so any prob­lems are spot­ted and dealt with as early as pos­si­ble.</p>
    <p>On the ef­fect of mu­ta­tion of the coro­n­avirus, Dr Ka­sai said that based on the thou­sands of gene se­quences avail­able, this is a rel­a­tively sta­ble virus, and work on a vac­cine will not be af­fected.</p>
    <p>He said the “sig­nif­i­cant in­vest­ments in health emer­gency pre­pared­ness made over sev­eral years” by coun­tries in the re­gion are pay­ing off, and are one rea­son for the com­par­a­tively low Covid-19 num­bers here.</p>
    <p>One les­son learnt dur­ing the pan­demic is that a coun­try’s re­sponse ca­pac­ity has to be scal­able, to match the size of the out­break.</p>
    <p>Dr Ka­sai con­cluded: “Covid-19 will be with us for the fore­see­able fu­ture. We know it’s a long and dif­fi­cult stretch, and we will face set­backs. But we must keep try­ing, learn­ing and do­ing it to­gether.</p>
    <p>“How we fare is up to each and every one of us. If we make the right choices every day, we will come out of this as safe and as strong as pos­si­ble.”</p>
    <p>Coun­tries plan­ning to open up “need to con­tinue to im­prove their sur­veil­lance sys­tem, and share that in­for­ma­tion”. They must come up with an agree­ment with the other coun­tries that al­low travel on how to man­age those who are trav­el­ling, so any prob­lems are spot­ted and dealt with as early as pos­si­ble.</p>
