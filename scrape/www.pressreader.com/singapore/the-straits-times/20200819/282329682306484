    <p>COLOGNE (Ger­many) • In­ter Mi­lan striker Lau­taro Martinez be­lieves his side are ready for “great things” after his dou­ble helped the Ital­ians book a spot in a first Euro­pean fi­nal in a decade.</p>
    <p>The Ar­gentina in­ter­na­tional got the ball rolling in the first half with a fine header to take his sea­son tally to 20 goals in all com­pe­ti­tions, be­fore adding a third in the sec­ond pe­riod to kill off Shakhtar Donetsk’s hopes of a come­back.</p>
    <p>Two goals from Romelu Lukaku com­pleted the 5-0 rout of their Ukrainian ri­vals in their Europa League semi-fi­nal on Mon­day – the big­gest-ever mar­gin of vic­tory at this stage of the com­pe­ti­tion.</p>
    <p>They will take on La Liga side and five-time Europa League win­ners Sevilla in Cologne on Sun­day and Martinez feels their fi­nal berth caps a sea­son that has seen the team im­prove game by game.</p>
    <p>“It was an in­cred­i­ble night, some­thing we have been dream­ing of,” he said.</p>
    <p>“We proved that In­ter are ready for great things, we are ready for the fi­nal.</p>
    <p>“I’m very happy with my goals be­cause I have had a dif­fi­cult pe­riod with goals. But mostly, I’m happy for the team, we are grow­ing day after day, a per­fect mix of ex­pe­ri­enced play­ers and young­sters.”</p>
    <p>An­to­nio Conte, who will be ap­pear­ing in his first Euro­pean fi­nal as a coach in what is his first sea­son with In­ter, was sim­i­larly de­lighted.</p>
    <p>“Many of our play­ers are fac­ing this kind of game for the first time in their ca­reers,” he said.</p>
    <p>“Sevilla have great ex­pe­ri­ence, they have won this com­pe­ti­tion sev­eral times.</p>
    <p>“But we are ready to try giv­ing a great joy to our fans. They should be proud of these guys be­cause they are giv­ing every­thing.”</p>
    <p>While Shakhtar suf­fered their big­gest de­feat in Europe since a 6-0 loss to Pre­mier League side Manchester City in the Cham­pi­ons League in Novem­ber 2018, they still bowed out with their heads held high.</p>
    <p>“We’ve had a fan­tas­tic jour­ney un­til this game,” their coach Luis Cas­tro said.</p>
    <p>“Of course, we’re un­happy with the re­sult. It will make ev­ery­one re­mem­ber a very sad ending of this cam­paign.</p>
    <p>“We were not our­selves after the sec­ond goal, and the coach must al­ways take the re­spon­si­bil­ity.”</p>
    <p>OH, WHAT A NIGHT</p>
    <p>It was an in­cred­i­ble night, some­thing we have been dream­ing of. We proved that In­ter are ready for great things, we are ready for the fi­nal. ’’</p>
    <p>LAU­TARO MARTINEZ , In­ter Mi­lan striker, after the team’s 5-0 vic­tory against Shakhtar.</p>
