    <p>In this time of pan­demic, peo­ple have been bom­barded with in­for­ma­tion about the na­ture of viruses, dif­fer­ent di­ag­nos­tic meth­ods, in­fec­tion path­ways, the sci­ence be­hind safe dis­tanc­ing, and the ef­fec­tive­ness of dif­fer­ent ma­te­ri­als for face masks in re­duc­ing trans­mis­sion risks.</p>
    <p>For many who prob­a­bly stud­ied sci­ence only in school, Covid-19 has pre­sented them with a lot of sci­ence to han­dle. To make in­formed de­ci­sions, it is vi­tal to un­der­stand the ev­i­dence.</p>
    <p>As Stem (sci­ence, tech­nol­ogy, en­gi­neer­ing and math­e­mat­ics) ed­u­ca­tion pro­fes­sion­als in­ter­ested in sci­ence ed­u­ca­tion, we are con­cerned about con­fu­sion due to in­for­ma­tion over­load, lives at risk due to non-com­pli­ance or in­com­plete un­der­stand­ing of in­for­ma­tion, and poor de­ci­sion-mak­ing due to ig­no­rance about who to be­lieve.</p>
    <p>Glob­ally, as sci­en­tists and med­i­cal pro­fes­sion­als seek to make sense of the com­plex­i­ties in­volved in the pan­demic, politi­cians and laypeo­ple try to wrap their heads around the mul­ti­ple and volatile pieces of in­for­ma­tion.</p>
    <p>Sci­en­tists dis­agree with one an­other or shift their stances from one week to an­other. The dif­fer­ence in in­ter­pret­ing sci­en­tific ev­i­dences and how they should be trans­lated into im­ple­men­ta­tion poli­cies can vary. Se­nior health cor­re­spon­dent Salma Kha­lik’s commentary in The Straits Times last Friday il­lus­trated ex­perts’ dif­fer­ent as­sess­ments of vac­cines and over­seas travel, given the same Covid-19 sit­u­a­tion.</p>
    <p>Whose ad­vice should we lis­ten to? Should we be wear­ing a mask? Does a cloth mask pro­tect us from in­fec­tion? Should we mask up while ex­er­cis­ing out­doors?</p>
    <p>Dur­ing such a time, is the younger gen­er­a­tion, be­ing more ex­posed to sci­ence in schools, more sci­en­tif­i­cally lit­er­ate to un­der­stand this in­for­ma­tion and can reach out to ex­plain it to their par­ents, grand­par­ents and neigh­bours?</p>
    <p>This high­lights the im­por­tance of Stem lit­er­acy in mak­ing per­sonal de­ci­sions based on sound sci­en­tific ev­i­dence.</p>
    <p>Rarely do right (or wrong) per­sonal de­ci­sions have such great im­pact at the com­mu­nity, na­tional and global level.</p>
    <p>As a so­ci­ety, Sin­ga­pore can con­tinue to build stronger Stem lit­er­acy among ci­ti­zens. In­di­vid­u­als could re­frain from in­dis­crim­i­nately for­ward­ing mes­sages over What­sApp, and the elderly should un­der­stand why they can­not hang out at ko­pi­ti­ams to chat with friends.</p>
    <p>As well, peo­ple should know that it is the dense liv­ing ar­range­ments with poor ven­ti­la­tion in dor­mi­to­ries that make safe dis­tanc­ing im­pos­si­ble and which caused the virus to spread, and not “dirty” habits.</p>
    <p>SCI­ENCE FOR LIFE</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore’s sci­ence ed­u­ca­tion is head­ing in the right direc­tion with Stem lit­er­acy. Its goal is “Sci­ence for Life and So­ci­ety”. Sin­ga­pore’s sci­ence cur­ricu­lum aims to en­thuse and nur­ture all stu­dents to be sci­en­tif­i­cally lit­er­ate.</p>
    <p>Two ar­eas of fo­cus are the de­vel­op­ment of per­sonal and cul­tural lit­er­acy.</p>
    <p>By per­sonal lit­er­acy, learn­ers develop a sci­en­tific mind­set with prac­ti­cal knowl­edge of sci­ence and its ap­pli­ca­tion to make ev­ery­day de­ci­sions, and solve prob­lems re­lated to sci­ence to im­prove one’s life.</p>
    <p>Be­ing Stem lit­er­ate in­cludes knowing how to seek and eval­u­ate ev­i­dence. For in­stance, a Stem-lit­er­ate per­son would know the type of ev­i­dence needed to sup­port the claim that a higher al­co­hol con­tent in hand sani­tiser in­creases its ef­fec­tive­ness.</p>
    <p>The­o­ret­i­cally, de­vel­op­ing per­sonal Stem lit­er­acy should help us make good per­sonal de­ci­sions on mat­ters re­lated to sci­ence. How­ever, where do we place sci­ence in the con­text of per­sonal be­liefs and val­ues? For in­stance, some “anti-vaxxers” be­lieve that vac­cines are im­moral and re­ject them, de­spite sci­en­tific ev­i­dence show­ing they can stop the spread of dis­eases and save lives.</p>
    <p>Per­sonal lit­er­acy is connected to civic lit­er­acy. Civic lit­er­acy refers to the abil­ity to ap­pre­ci­ate sci­ence as an arte­fact of hu­man­ity and cul­ture, and to ap­ply sci­en­tific ideas to en­gage in so­cio-sci­en­tific is­sues in an eth­i­cal and in­formed man­ner.</p>
    <p>EX­PERT OPIN­ION</p>
    <p>Laypeo­ple have lim­ited ac­cess to so­phis­ti­cated lab­o­ra­to­ries to gather sci­en­tific ev­i­dence, and the time and ex­per­tise to di­gest re­search lit­er­a­ture. Con­se­quently, they turn to ex­pert opin­ion. We need suf­fi­cient knowl­edge to eval­u­ate and jus­tify ex­pert opinions. So a per­son with Stem lit­er­acy de­vel­ops “gut feel” when an ex­pert opin­ion sounds amiss.</p>
    <p>In ad­di­tion, when con­sid­er­ing whether we should trust an ex­pert opin­ion, we can con­sider two cri­te­ria. First, is there any self-in­ter­est? Will the ex­pert ben­e­fit in sig­nif­i­cant ways if peo­ple be­lieved his opin­ion? Think about the bat­tle be­tween Dr An­thony Fauci, a top in­fec­tious dis­ease ex­pert, and United States Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump. A Straits Times re­port on May 15 noted that Pres­i­dent Trump dis­agreed with the warn­ing given by Dr Fauci about the dan­gers of re­open­ing the econ­omy and schools too quickly.</p>
    <p>Sec­ond, does the ex­pert have rel­e­vant ex­per­tise in the field to pro­vide the opin­ion? For ex­am­ple, you would con­sult a med­i­cal doc­tor if you had a fever or a cough, but you would con­sult a psy­chol­o­gist if you were feel­ing anx­ious or de­pressed.</p>
    <p>To be Stem lit­er­ate, in­di­vid­u­als need the abil­ity to dis­cern the au­then­tic­ity of the in­for­ma­tion source, and make log­i­cal de­ci­sions.</p>
    <p>In Sin­ga­pore, much of the com­mu­ni­ca­tion of Covid-19 in­for­ma­tion comes from the Govern­ment. We moved from “wear a mask only when you are sick” to “wear a mask when you leave your house”; and from “schools are the safest place” to</p>
    <p>“full home-based learn­ing”.</p>
    <p>How do we con­sume these seem­ingly dif­fer­ent yet strongly jus­ti­fied de­ci­sions by our politi­cians? We can com­ply and com­plain that the Govern­ment is con­fus­ing us. Thus, ev­ery change in de­ci­sion is deemed a mis­take.</p>
    <p>Al­ter­na­tively, we can seek to un­der­stand how sci­ence is used, to­gether with sys­temic con­straints and so­cial fac­tors, by the Govern­ment to con­tin­u­ously in­form and up­date de­ci­sions.</p>
    <p>The pan­demic is a re­newed call for the pro­mo­tion of Stem lit­er­acy – per­sonal and civic. When en­coun­ter­ing ad­vice or in­for­ma­tion re­lated to sci­ence, we could ask where and how the ev­i­dence was ob­tained.</p>
    <p>The kind of Stem lit­er­acy needed to han­dle an acute cri­sis such as Covid-19 is sim­i­lar to yet dif­fer­ent from the Stem lit­er­acy needed for day-to-day liv­ing – un­der­stand­ing the po­lit­i­cal na­ture of in­for­ma­tion, be­ing log­i­cal and mak­ing de­ci­sions based on ra­tio­nale rather than fear. This jus­ti­fies the im­por­tance of in­fus­ing Stem lit­er­acy in ev­ery as­pect of ed­u­ca­tion, and not wait­ing for a cri­sis to ed­u­cate peo­ple. post-doc­toral fel­low with the Nat­u­ral Sciences and Sci­ence Ed­u­ca­tion Aca­demic Group.
