Put aside your own concerns and focus on what others are needing or saying. Your selflessne­ss pays off down the road. Taurus (April 20 - May 20)
Spice up your routines with some fresh activities, new routes or silly games you make up as you go along. Your fun energy is infectious. Gemini (May 21 - June 20)
You are having lots of fun, so much so that you might find it easy to smooth over an old feud or take care of a longstandi­ng problem. Cancer (June 21 - July 22)
Your home needs attention.
Spring clean or fix a problem before getting comfortabl­e – you have the right attitude for it all. Leo (July 23 - Aug 22)
You find it easier to get along with someone who is often a pain in your side. Just roll with the friction and things will improve in a good way. Virgo (Aug 23 - Sept 22)
Impulse buying is a problem, so stash your credit cards where you cannot reach them and turn off your Internet connection. Scorpio Libra (Sept 23 - Oct 22)
You may find yourself flirting with almost everyone you meet. It is all good fun until the wrong person starts taking it too seriously. (Oct 23 - Nov 21)
Though you have all the informatio­n you need, it is still hard for you to make decisions. See if you can get your friends to help. Sagittariu­s (Nov 22 - Dec 21)
You need extra time to make sense of business, so set aside a time and place to think things through. Your people are sure to lend a hand. Capricorn (Dec 22 - Jan 19)
Take care of a career-related issue soon. Move on up the ladder, find a new job or see if you can start your own business from scratch. Aquarius (Jan 20 - Feb 18)
Your brainpower is legendary and that means you bust out with a few hot ideas. Things look good for you if you can act on them. Pisces (Feb 19 - March 20)
Try not to read too much into it when your mate or business partner starts freaking out. You should both come to an understand­ing soon. Provided by Astrology.com (www.astrology.com) SURIA AM 9.00 10.00 PM (D)/ AM In Our Time (CC) (IE)
