    <p>As Sino-Rus­sian sus­pi­cions mount in the Arc­tic with the United States cast­ing a watch­ful eye, the world may be about to wit­ness a re­set of Wash­ing­ton-Moscow ties, says as­so­ciate edi­tor Ravi Vel­loor (below).</p>
    <p>With their three-decade tus­sle for lead­er­ship of the com­mu­nist world – in­clud­ing a fate­ful clash on the Us­suri River in 1969 – a dis­tant mem­ory, Sino-Rus­sian ties have shown re­mark­able ad­vances in re­cent years.</p>
    <p>The land bor­der was set­tled in 1991, mu­tual troop re­duc­tions along the fron­tier fol­lowed and an arms trade be­gan, high­lighted by the land­mark Chi­nese pur­chase of the Su-27 fighter that was de­nied at the time even to War­saw Pact al­lies, who had ac­cess only to the less so­phis­ti­cated MiG-29.</p>
    <p>Lately, China has even bought the so­phis­ti­cated S-400 air de­fence sys­tem and Su-35 fight­ers, even as techno-na­tion­al­ists in Rus­sia fret about unau­tho­rised Chi­nese copy­ing of the war equip­ment they had de­signed.</p>
    <p>For Asia, the war games the Rus­sian and Chi­nese navies con­ducted in the South China Sea in 2016, as well as Chi­nese in­au­gu­ral par­tic­i­pa­tion in the mas­sive Vos­tok war games in the Rus­sian Far East two years later, were the high vis­i­bil­ity points of a grow­ing con­cord be­tween the two pow­ers, drawn to­gether by their in­di­vid­ual geopo­lit­i­cal tus­sles with the United States.</p>
    <p>Now, though, a key fork in the road pos­si­bly looms be­tween Moscow and Bei­jing.</p>
    <p>Two weeks ago and a year after she was com­mis­sioned in Shang­hai, Xue­long 2, the first po­lar re­search ves­sel built by China, was dis­patched to the Arc­tic sea route on what is billed as a sci­en­tific mis­sion.</p>
    <p>The ice­breaker, which means Snow Dragon 2 in English, is smaller than its pre­de­ces­sor Xue­long, but is sig­nif­i­cantly more ad­vanced. Hav­ing com­pleted a voy­age to the Antarc­tic, where China has no fewer than four re­search sta­tions with a fifth un­der con­struc­tion, it is now headed to the Arc­tic – which many re­gard as the next South China Sea when it comes to po­ten­tial con­flict.</p>
    <p>The 12,000km jour­ney along the so-called North­ern Sea Route could sig­nal a mean­ing­ful tilt in the power bal­ance along the route, thus far dom­i­nated by Rus­sia.</p>
    <p>In­deed, Moscow is loath to give up con­trol of the route. In May, con­struc­tion be­gan on the first of three mas­sive icebreaker­s, the cen­tre of Moscow’s Arc­tic strat­egy to open a 6,000km Asia to Europe pas­sage within its ex­clu­sive eco­nomic zone that some day could ri­val the Suez Canal and cut jour­ney times by up to three weeks.</p>
    <p>At the heart of the emerg­ing geopol­i­tics in the Arc­tic is the vast im­pact that cli­mate change is bring­ing to nav­i­ga­tion along the Arc­tic ship­ping route, also called the North­ern Sea Route.</p>
    <p>Shorter win­ters are caus­ing ear­lier ice melts, while the lat­est nu­clear-pow­ered icebreaker­s can go through ice 4m thick at a speed of 10 knots, slic­ing a 50m-wide sweep of nav­i­ga­ble wa­ters for ships sail­ing in their wake.</p>
    <p>Not that the area wasn’t sig­nif­i­cant enough al­ready.</p>
    <p>Un­der the po­lar ice cap was where the erst­while Soviet Union parked its nu­clear-armed sub­marines, the so-called sec­ond strike ca­pa­bil­ity, away from de­tec­tion. What’s more, the area pro­vides a quar­ter of Rus­sian ex­ports – most of it gas but also rare earths and met­als – and a third of the fish har­vested.</p>
    <p>CHINA’S IN­CREAS­ING FOOT­PRINT</p>
    <p>Now, China is in­creas­ing its foot­print with two mod­ern icebreaker­s in the re­gion, and Rus­sian un­ease is grow­ing. In the Rus­sian mind­set, says Dr Dmitri Trenin of the Carnegie Moscow Cen­tre, the hi­er­ar­chy of states’ na­tional in­ter­ests in the Arc­tic does not in­clude China in the top rungs.</p>
    <p>The first five are those with di­rect ac­cess to the Arc­tic Ocean – Canada, Den­mark, Nor­way, Rus­sia and the US. Next are the three other per­ma­nent mem­bers of the Arc­tic Coun­cil – Fin­land, Ice­land and Swe­den. China, Ja­pan, South Korea, In­dia and Sin­ga­pore were all made ob­servers in 2013 and Moscow would like to keep them there.</p>
    <p>At this point, Moscow’s in­ter­ests in the Arc­tic co­in­cide with Wash­ing­ton to a de­gree.</p>
    <p>With the Indo-Pa­cific dis­plac­ing Europe as the key the­atre of con­test and China sup­plant­ing Moscow as the No. 1 threat in Wash­ing­ton’s per­cep­tion, the Pen­tagon does not want to hand China an Arc­tic es­cape hatch.</p>
    <p>Here the is­sues be­gin. China sees the North­ern Sea Route as part of its Po­lar Silk Road, one of six “belt and road” links con­nect­ing China to Europe. Even as its near­est point to the Arc­tic Ocean is at least 1,500km away, it has de­clared it­self a “near Arc­tic state”.</p>
    <p>It is also steadily adding as­sets in the re­gion. Cur­rently, the Cana­dian govern­ment is re­view­ing gi­ant Chi­nese miner Shan­dong Gold Min­ing’s pur­chase of Toronto-based TMAC Re­sources, whose op­er­a­tions are 170km north of the Arc­tic Cir­cle.</p>
    <p>Chi­nese com­pa­nies such as MMG and Jilin Jien Nickel In­dus­try own min­eral de­posits and op­er­ate mines there. The TMAC pur­chase is par­tic­u­larly sen­si­tive for the West and Nato be­cause its min­ing op­er­a­tion has ac­cess to tide­wa­ter lead­ing to the North­west Pas­sage which con­nects the Pa­cific and</p>
    <p>At­lantic oceans.</p>
    <p>An­a­lysts say China’s next ma­jor diplo­matic push will likely come at the next Arc­tic Coun­cil Min­is­te­rial Meet­ing sched­uled for next May, when it may seek to move up from its cur­rent ob­server sta­tus, per­haps even push­ing for full mem­ber­ship.</p>
    <p>While Moscow may chafe at this and pre­fer to keep the dis­cus­sions be­tween the First Five – a sort of se­cu­rity coun­cil of the Arc­tic – it may be com­pelled to go along.</p>
    <p>The “facts on the ground” Bei­jing has cre­ated, in­clud­ing the just-added ice­breaker, may add sub­stance to its am­bi­tion.</p>
    <p>THE U.S. RE­SPONSE</p>
    <p>This is where the US has be­gun to sense an open­ing to loosen the Sino-Rus­sian bond. Fo­cused heav­ily on the Mid­dle East and, in­creas­ingly, the Indo-Pa­cific, Wash­ing­ton had taken its eyes off the Arc­tic for years. It sent a car­rier strike group north of the Arc­tic Cir­cle in 2018, but that came after a gap of over a quar­ter-cen­tury.</p>
    <p>This year, how­ever, the Europe-based US Sixth Fleet has re­sumed reg­u­lar sail­ing in the Arc­tic Cir­cle. Ac­cord­ing to De­fense News, the ser­vice plans to grow to six de­stroy­ers for­ward-de­ployed in the re­gion, from to­day’s four.</p>
    <p>“I think that the Ber­ing Strait is strate­gi­cally as im­por­tant as the Strait of Malacca or the Strait of Hor­muz,” the chief of naval op­er­a­tions, Ad­mi­ral Michael</p>
    <p>Gil­day, told the Se­nate Armed Ser­vices Com­mit­tee in March.</p>
    <p>Last week, US Sec­re­tary of State Mike Pom­peo said on a brief visit to Den­mark that the US will be­come more ac­tive in the Arc­tic to counter Rus­sia and thwart China’s at­tempts to insert it­self into the re­gion. The US also just re­opened a con­sulate in Nuuk, in the semi-au­ton­o­mous Dan­ish ter­ri­tory of Green­land.</p>
    <p>The Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion would prob­a­bly move faster on re­set­ting ties with Moscow, ex­cept that Rus­sia still evokes vis­ceral an­tipa­thy within the Amer­i­can elite, a hang­over from the Cold War.</p>
    <p>In­deed, at the height of that geopo­lit­i­cal tus­sle, when Wash­ing­ton sought to mend ties with Bei­jing to take on Moscow, then Na­tional Se­cu­rity Ad­viser Henry Kissinger had pre­dicted that in 20 years, the US would be go­ing the op­po­site way – look­ing to Moscow to counter China.</p>
    <p>“(The Chi­nese are) just as dan­ger­ous,” Dr Kissinger is heard say­ing in tran­scripts of White House tape record­ings of a meet­ing with then Pres­i­dent Richard Nixon held on Feb 14, 1972.</p>
    <p>“In fact, they are more dan­ger­ous over a his­tor­i­cal pe­riod.”</p>
    <p>Through a mix of de­lib­er­ate mod­esty and care­ful sig­nalling, Bei­jing man­aged to stave off that Kissinger-pre­dicted mo­ment by at least a decade, but it has ar­rived.</p>
    <p>US ner­vous­ness about China has reached alarmist pro­por­tions and that has led to the new ver­sion of the Cold War, com­plete with the mus­cu­lar at­tempt to wrench China out of the global sup­ply chain and tech­nol­ogy flows.</p>
    <p>Re­cent state­ments from Wash­ing­ton carry hints of the long-fore­seen and, to some, long-awaited change of at­ti­tude to­wards Moscow.</p>
    <p>Last Thurs­day, after trav­el­ling to the Richard Nixon Pres­i­den­tial Li­brary in Cal­i­for­nia to de­liver a speech declar­ing that 50 years of en­gage­ment with China had failed and it was time for free so­ci­eties to stand up to Bei­jing, Mr Pom­peo was bluntly asked whether he saw op­por­tu­nity for the US to en­list Rus­sian help in its tus­sle.</p>
    <p>Mr Pom­peo ac­knowl­edged that the op­por­tu­nity ex­isted, “born of the re­la­tion­ship, the nat­u­ral re­la­tion­ship be­tween Rus­sia and China” – a ref­er­ence to the deep-felt sus­pi­cions in Rus­sia about its neigh­bour to the east.</p>
    <p>He went on to say: “I think there is a place for us to work with the Rus­sians to achieve a more likely out­come of peace, not only for the United States but for the world.”</p>
    <p>Last month, Deputy Sec­re­tary of State Stephen Biegun told the Fi­nan­cial Times that he was con­fi­dent that the US could find “the seam” in the re­la­tion­ship be­tween Rus­sia and China, the two be­ing fused solely by a “mu­tual de­ter­mi­na­tion to chal­lenge the United States”.</p>
    <p>The turn will be con­firmed if the US eases the sanc­tions on Rus­sia im­posed after its an­nex­a­tion of Crimea from Ukraine. But a bit of eas­ing has al­ready hap­pened qui­etly and that has left some oli­garchs close to Rus­sian Pres­i­dent Vladimir Putin breath­ing a lit­tle eas­ier.</p>
    <p>In an elec­tion year, you would not ex­pect more from the US.</p>
    <p>Dr Kissinger, who turned 97 ear­lier this year, may live to see his prophecy ful­filled.</p>
