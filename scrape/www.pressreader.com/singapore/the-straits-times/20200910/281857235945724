    <p>KUALA LUMPUR A for­mer aide to the wife of for­mer Malaysian premier Na­jib Razak told a court yes­ter­day that he re­ceived RM100,000 (S$32,800) a month from Ros­mah Man­sor in 2012 to pay a team of “cy­ber troop­ers” to mon­i­tor con­tent on so­cial me­dia and de­fend her from on­line at­tacks.</p>
    <p>“This team was also re­spon­si­ble for coun­ter­ing and pro­vid­ing ex­pla­na­tion to every slan­der, as­ser­tion and ac­cu­sa­tion to­wards Datin Seri Ros­mah to the pub­lic,” said Datuk Rizal Man­sor, who is not re­lated to Ros­mah.</p>
    <p>“The cy­ber troop­ers were op­er­at­ing on funds pro­vided by Datin Seri Ros­mah her­self. She gave me RM100,000 cash every month to fi­nance the team,” the wit­ness was quoted by the Malay Mail as say­ing in the cor­rup­tion trial of Ros­mah.</p>
    <p>The 69-year-old is fac­ing a charge of so­lic­it­ing RM187.5 mil­lion and two counts of re­ceiv­ing a to­tal of RM6.5 mil­lion in ex­change for help­ing a com­pany, Jepak Hold­ings, win a RM1.25 bil­lion so­lar project for schools in Sarawak.</p>
    <p>Mr Rizal him­self was ini­tially charged with four counts of so­lic­it­ing and re­ceiv­ing bribes in­volv­ing RM218 mil­lion for Ros­mah over the same project. But the charges were with­drawn and he was ac­quit­ted in Jan­uary.</p>
    <p>Mr Rizal, 46, told the Kuala Lumpur High Court yes­ter­day that his main re­spon­si­bil­i­ties were guard­ing Ros­mah’s im­age and rep­u­ta­tion as she was un­der close scru­tiny by the pub­lic.</p>
    <p>Mr Rizal, who is the 21st pros­e­cu­tion wit­ness, said Ros­mah was of­ten the sub­ject of pub­lic per­cep­tion, such as how she was the real power be­hind Na­jib and for lead­ing an ex­trav­a­gant life­style, Malay Mail on­line news said.</p>
    <p>He said that in 2012, Ros­mah told him to es­tab­lish a team of cy­ber troop­ers – in­di­vid­u­als who would dis­sem­i­nate on­line po­lit­i­cal pro­pa­ganda for a fee – that would be paid by her.</p>
    <p>Mr Rizal also told the court that Ros­mah was feared in the civil ser­vice due to her rep­u­ta­tion as the “fierce wife” of Na­jib, but this was merely their per­cep­tion, The Star on­line news re­ported.</p>
    <p>He added that she was seen as the spouse who could in­flu­ence the de</p>
    <p>ci­sions and ac­tions of Na­jib.</p>
    <p>“In the eyes of the pub­lic ser­vants, Ros­mah has the abil­ity to in­flu­ence the prime min­is­ter in trans­fer­ring gov­ern­ment ser­vants who</p>
    <p>op­pose or defy her re­quests to lesser po­si­tions, or in other words, to be put in ‘cold stor­age’, or have them moved to places far­ther than where they live,” Mr Rizal said.</p>
    <p>He gath­ered this per­cep­tion, he said, when min­gling with civil ser­vants, but he said that at that point in time, he did not be­lieve it to be true and as­cribed it to ru­mours that</p>
    <p>were be­ing spread to ruin Ros­mah’s rep­u­ta­tion.</p>
    <p>“As her spe­cial of­fi­cer, I would al­ways de­fend her im­age to these peo­ple,” he said.</p>
