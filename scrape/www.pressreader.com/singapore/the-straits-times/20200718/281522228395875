    <p>De­vel­oper OUE will sell US Bank Tower – known for its cameos in Hol­ly­wood movies such as In­de­pen­dence Day, Rush Hour and San An­dreas – for well un­der its value.</p>
    <p>The sale price of US$430 mil­lion (S$597.7 mil­lion) is about twothirds the property’s US$650 mil­lion fair value as at Dec 31 last year, ac­cord­ing to OUE’s an­nual re­port.</p>
    <p>The price to be paid by the buyer – USBT Property Owner – was ar­rived at af­ter tak­ing into ac­count the property’s mar­ket value and the state of that mar­ket amid the pan­demic, said OUE yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The main­board-listed com­pany said last month that it was in talks with a pos­si­ble in­sti­tu­tional buyer.</p>
    <p>Sev­eral United States me­dia out­lets re­ported that New York-based real es­tate in­vestor Sil­ver­stein Prop­er­ties – whose port­fo­lio in­cludes the new World Trade Cen­ter in New York – had been in ad­vanced dis­cus­sions to buy the iconic US Bank Tower and was ne­go­ti­at­ing a price in the range of US$425 mil­lion to US$450 mil­lion.</p>
    <p>It was also re­ported that ini­tial ex­pec­ta­tions had been for bids to come in at around US$700 mil­lion.</p>
    <p>OUE’s earn­ings per share is ex­pected to de­cline by about 35 cents for this fis­cal year as a re­sult of the dis­posal.</p>
    <p>This im­pact is mainly non-cash and arises from the dif­fer­ence be­tween the sale price and the book value as at Dec 31 last year.</p>
    <p>US Bank Tower is a Class A block in down­town Los An­ge­les. It was com­pleted in 1989 and has 72 floors of of­fices and six lev­els of un­der­ground park­ing. It also fea­tures an out­door glass slide 305m above ground.</p>
    <p>OUE unit Beringia ac­quired the property in 2013 for about US$367.5 mil­lion and un­der­took ren­o­va­tions, in­clud­ing adding an open-air ob­ser­va­tion deck called OUE Skys­pace LA and the glass slide.</p>
    <p>OUE also plans to sell its lease­hold in­ter­est in OUE Skys­pace LA.</p>
    <p>Beringia is in dis­cus­sions with “sev­eral” prospec­tive pur­chasers of the Skys­pace op­er­a­tions but no agree­ment has been reached, said OUE.</p>
    <p>OUE said the move to sell the of­fice tower came af­ter it eval­u­ated its in­ven­tory of as­sets.</p>
    <p>Al­though the property is be­ing sold be­low its val­u­a­tion, it is still ex­pected to ben­e­fit the firm and share­hold­ers as it will en­able the group to stream­line as­set own­er­ship in a pe­riod when the longer-term out­look for the US property mar­ket may not be favourable, OUE said.</p>
    <p>Ten­ants in US Bank Tower have re­duced or tem­po­rar­ily shut­tered their op­er­a­tions amid the pan­demic, which has hit rental in­come.</p>
    <p>OUE said the cap­i­tal un­locked by the sale can be re­cy­cled to bet­ter rein­vest­ment op­por­tu­ni­ties.</p>
    <p>The sale will also sub­stan­tially in­crease the group’s cash re­serves and im­prove its net gear­ing by par­ing ex­ist­ing debts.</p>
    <p>The trans­ac­tion is sched­uled to be com­pleted around Septem­ber.</p>
    <p>In a sep­a­rate fil­ing yes­ter­day, OUE Com­mer­cial Real Es­tate In­vest­ment Trust’s man­ager dis­closed that un­der its right of first re­fusal, it had re­ceived an of­fer from OUE to ac­quire US Bank Tower for US$430 mil­lion.</p>
    <p>It de­clined the of­fer be­cause it felt buy­ing the property on the pro­posed terms would not be ac­cre­tive to its dis­tri­bu­tion per unit.</p>
    <p>OUE started mar­ket­ing US Bank Tower in Jan­uary last year.</p>
    <p>The build­ing was “blown up” in the 1996 block­buster In­de­pen­dence Day and also ap­peared sev­eral times in Ter­mi­na­tor 2: Judg­ment Day (1991) and other movies in the fran­chise.</p>
    <p>It was also seen in the Rush Hour and Rush Hour 2 movies star­ring Hong Kong celebrity Jackie Chan and, more re­cently, the 2015 dis­as­ter film San An­dreas de­picted the tower as one of many build­ings that col­lapsed in an earthquake.</p>
    <p>OUE shares closed flat at $1.22 yes­ter­day.</p>
