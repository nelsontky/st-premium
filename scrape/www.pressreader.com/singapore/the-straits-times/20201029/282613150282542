    <p>Slave, witch, pros­ti­tute or mother: A new ex­hibit at Spain’s Prado mu­seum ex­plores how misog­yny in­flu­enced the way women were por­trayed in art, and the role that the mu­seum it­self played.</p>
    <p>Un­in­vited Guests, the mu­seum’s first post-lock­down ex­hi­bi­tion, is di­vided into sec­tions with names such as “moth­ers un­der judg­ment”, “guid­ance for the way­ward” and “the art of in­doc­tri­na­tion”.</p>
    <p>One of the aims is to put the spotlight on “an ideology, a state pro­pa­ganda re­gard­ing the fe­male fig­ure”, which ex­isted be­tween 1833 and 1931, cu­ra­tor Car­los Navarro told Agence France-Presse.</p>
    <p>The art­works from this pe­riod re­veal a “bour­geois think­ing which sought to val­i­date the role that so­ci­ety at­trib­uted to women”, he added.</p>
    <p>With this show the Prado, one of Europe’s finest paint­ing col­lec­tions which cel­e­brated its 200th an­niver­sary l ast year, hopes to make amends for the role it played in this process.</p>
    <p>The mu­seum ac­knowl­edges that dur­ing the pe­riod in ques­tion, dis­crim­i­na­tion op­er­ated not just against fe­male artists but in the way women were rep­re­sented in the works the state bought and ex­hib­ited.</p>
    <p>The show fo­cuses on the pe­riod be­tween 1833 and 1931 be­cause that is when the Prado says it started to play a “key” role in the “ac­qui­si­tion and dis­play of con­tem­po­rary art”. That gave it “an im­por­tant role in the con­struc­tion of the idea of a modern Span­ish school” of art.</p>
    <p>The ex­hi­bi­tion ex­plores how paint­ings by men at the time rel­e­gated women to sec­ondary roles, usu­ally as at­trac­tive ac­ces­sories.</p>
    <p>Two works by Span­ish painter Pe­dro Saenz Saenz, his 1897 Chrysalid, and In­no­cence, com­pleted two years later, both de­pict a naked, pre­pubescent girl in a sug­ges­tive pose.</p>
    <p>Young mod­els at the time were forced to pose naked, in tears, for pain­ters dur­ing an era when there was “no age limit or vi­o­lence in the nude,” said Mr Navarro as he stood be­fore the paint­ings.</p>
    <p>The few times women are the pro­tag­o­nists, it is of­ten against their will. The Rebel, for ex­am­ple, a 1914 work by Span­ish painter An­to­nio Fil­lol Granell, de­picts a Roma girl be­ing ex­pelled by her fam­ily from their camp – pre­sum­ably for some kind of moral trans­gres­sion.</p>
    <p>The sec­ond half of the ex­hi­bi­tion fea­tures works by women from that era, who were marginalis­ed be­cause of their gen­der. It in­cludes many still-lifes – rep­re­sen­ta­tion of house­hold ob­jects such as flowers or food. But there are few por­traits, as these were re­served for male pain­ters.</p>
    <p>This sec­tion in­cludes works by two women, France’s Rosa Bon­heur and Spain’s Maria An­to­nia Banue­los, who did not get the recog­ni­tion they de­served in Spain at the time, Mr Navarro said. No works by</p>
    <p>Banue­los can be found in Spain today, he added.</p>
    <p>Iron­i­cally, shortly af­ter the ex­hi­bi­tion opened, the Prado was forced to re­move a paint­ing from this sec­tion af­ter it was found to have been painted by a man, and not a woman as pre­vi­ously thought.</p>
    <p>And of the 130 works in the ex­hi­bi­tion, 70 are signed by men, prompt­ing com­plaints from some fem­i­nist groups that it does not ded­i­cate enough space to works by women.</p>
    <p>A group called Women in the Vis­ual Arts, which has over 500 mem­bers, said the show was a “missed op­por­tu­nity” to give over­looked fe­male artists their due.</p>
    <p>Mr Navarro, who is the lead cu­ra­tor for the ex­hi­bi­tion, dis­missed the con­tro­versy, say­ing it was sparked by “his­to­ri­ans and es­pe­cially con­tem­po­rary art crit­ics who had hoped to be part of the project”.</p>
