    <p>There were 91 new coro­n­avirus cases con­firmed as of noon yes­ter­day, tak­ing Sin­ga­pore’s to­tal to 55,838.</p>
    <p>They in­cluded six im­ported cases who had been placed on stay-home no­tice upon ar­rival in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>No cases in the com­mu­nity were re­ported, said the Min­istry of Health (MOH) in its daily up­date.</p>
    <p>The im­ported cases in­cluded two Sin­ga­porean men and a per­ma­nent res­i­dent who ar­rived from In­dia be­tween Aug 5 and Sun­day.</p>
    <p>The Sin­ga­pore­ans are aged 56 and 54, while the PR is a 44-yearold woman. They tested pos­i­tive for the virus be­tween Sun­day and yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>A 27-year-old United States cit­i­zen, who is a work pass holder, was also among the im­ported cases. He ar­rived in Sin­ga­pore from the US on Aug 5 and tested pos­i­tive for the virus last Satur­day.</p>
    <p>The last two im­ported cases are a work pass holder who ar­rived from</p>
    <p>In­dia and a work per­mit holder who ar­rived from In­done­sia.</p>
    <p>They were asymp­to­matic and tested pos­i­tive on Sun­day. MOH said all of them had been placed on 14-day stay-home no­tice upon ar­rival in Sin­ga­pore, and had been tested while serv­ing their no­tice.</p>
    <p>Mi­grant work­ers stay­ing in dor­mi­to­ries made up the re­main­ing 85 new coro­n­avirus pa­tients an­nounced yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Three clus­ters in dor­mi­to­ries were closed as the dorms have been cleared by the in­ter-agency task force, and now house only re­cov­ered in­di­vid­u­als and those who have re­cently tested neg­a­tive for Covid-19 in­fec­tion.</p>
    <p>The num­ber of new daily cases in the com­mu­nity has re­mained sta­ble at an av­er­age of two cases per day in the past two weeks, said MOH.</p>
    <p>The num­ber of un­linked cases in the com­mu­nity has also re­mained sta­ble at an av­er­age of one case per day over the same pe­riod.</p>
    <p>With 397 cases dis­charged yes­ter­day, 52,335 pa­tients have fully re­cov­ered from the dis­ease.</p>
    <p>A to­tal of 82 pa­tients remain in hos­pi­tal, while 3,379 are re­cu­per­at­ing in com­mu­nity fa­cil­i­ties. None is in in­ten­sive care.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore has had 27 deaths from Covid-19 com­pli­ca­tions, while 15 who tested pos­i­tive have died of other causes.</p>
