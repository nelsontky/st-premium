    <p>Work­ing a few hours part-time on rest days is moon­light­ing and is il­le­gal. The law is clear about that (Clamp down on maids who work part-time il­le­gally; Sept 12).</p>
    <p>But there is a rea­son why some maids still do it.</p>
    <p>It is the same as why some Sin­ga­pore­ans hold two jobs – to make ends meet or pay off their debts. I know what poverty is and why, in my younger days, I had to work while oth­ers could rest.</p>
    <p>The house­hold work of ev­ery fam­ily is dif­fer­ent and some fam­i­lies re­ally do not re­quire full-time maids. Hence, lim­ited part-time work would be ideal for their needs. Al­low­ing maids to bridge this gap would be a good match.</p>
    <p>If the law can legally al­low maids to work on rest days and be paid in lieu of their day off, why can’t the law be tweaked to al­low them to work four to five hours for other fam­i­lies who need them most when their em­ploy­ers don’t re­quire their ser­vices?</p>
    <p>Poverty and hard­ship forced these maids to in­cur thou­sands of dol­lars of debt to pay re­cruit­ment agents to se­cure jobs here, re­sult­ing in them work­ing with no pay for up to a year’s salary.</p>
    <p>We need to recog­nise why they had to leave their chil­dren be­hind to travel thou­sands of kilo­me­tres to work over­seas. Earn­ing money to sup­port their fam­i­lies back home is the prime ob­jec­tive.</p>
    <p>We should em­pathise with their sit­u­a­tion to help them fi­nan­cially within rea­son­able lim­its. If we al­low them to put in a few hours of part-time work on do­mes­tic tasks on their rest days in pri­vate homes, they can earn some ex­tra in­come.</p>
