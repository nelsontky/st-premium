    <p>RUS­SIAN OP­PO­SI­TION LEADER ALEXEI NAVALNY, CLAIM­ING HE TRICKED AN AGENT INTO AD­MIT­TING THE FSB TRIED TO KILL HIM BY PUTTING POI­SON IN HIS UN­DER­WEAR</p>
    <p>MOSCOW • Rus­sia said yes­ter­day that it was hit­ting EU of­fi­cials with sanc­tions for their re­sponse to the poisoning of op­po­si­tion fig­ure Alexei Navalny, who the Kremlin said was suf­fer­ing from “delu­sions of per­se­cu­tion”.</p>
    <p>The for­eign min­istry in Moscow sum­moned sev­eral se­nior EU diplo­mats be­fore an­nounc­ing the new travel bans.</p>
    <p>In re­sponse to “con­fronta­tional” sanc­tions im­posed by the bloc in</p>
    <p>Oc­to­ber, Rus­sia “de­cided to ex­pand the list of rep­re­sen­ta­tives of Euro­pean Union mem­ber states and in­sti­tu­tions who will be de­nied en­try to Rus­sia”.</p>
    <p>The an­nounce­ment came a day af­ter Mr Navalny, 44, said in a re­port that he had im­per­son­ated an of­fi­cial in the Kremlin’s Se­cu­rity Coun­cil and ex­tracted an ad­mis­sion of guilt from a tox­ins ex­pert with the FSB, Rus­sia’s se­cu­rity ser­vice.</p>
    <p>In a video of the con­ver­sa­tion pub­lished by Mr Navalny, the al­leged FSB agent says agents placed poi­son in Mr Navalny’s un­der­wear this sum­mer.</p>
    <p>The anti-cor­rup­tion cam­paigner was flown for treat­ment to Ger­many where labs con­cluded he had been poi­soned with Novi­chok, a Soviet-de­signed nerve agent.</p>
    <p>The video of his con­ver­sa­tion with the al­leged tox­ins ex­pert, named Mr Kon­stantin Kudryavt­sev, racked up more than 12 mil­lion views in less than 24 hours.</p>
    <p>In a bomb­shell blog post, the Kremlin critic said he called Mr Kudryavt­sev, claim­ing he was a chem­i­cal weapons ex­pert with the FSB. “I called my killer. He con­fessed ev­ery­thing,” Mr Navalny tweeted, adding that he pre­sented him­self as an aide to Se­cu­rity Coun­cil chief Niko­lai Pa­tru­shev.</p>
    <p>The Kremlin yes­ter­day de­scribed Mr Navalny as a “sick” man who was suf­fer­ing from “delu­sions of per­se­cu­tion”.</p>
    <p>Pres­i­dent Vladimir Putin’s spokesman Dmitry Peskov de­nied that Mr Navalny’s claims could dis­credit the FSB, adding that the op­po­si­tion politi­cian also ex­hib­ited “traits of mega­lo­ma­nia”.</p>
    <p>“They say he com­pares him­self to Je­sus,” Mr Peskov added.</p>
    <p>Rus­sia’s counter sanc­tions were an­nounced af­ter Moscow sum­moned se­nior diplo­mats from Ger­many, France and Swe­den, the three coun­tries where labs have said Mr Navalny was poi­soned with Novi­chok.</p>
    <p>The find­ings re­sulted in EU sanc­tions against sev­eral Rus­sian of­fi­cials in Oc­to­ber, in­clud­ing the head of the FSB.</p>
