    <p>PUY MARY (France) • Pri­moz Roglic tight­ened his grip on the Tour de France, af­ter drop­ping de­fend­ing cham­pion Egan Ber­nal in the fi­nal as­cent of a gru­elling 13th stage in the Mas­sif Cen­tral yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Colom­bian Dani Martinez took his ca­reer’s first Tour stage vic­tory. He pre­vailed from the break­away at the end of a pun­ish­ing 191.5km trek from Cha­tel-Guyon be­fore the big guns bat­tled it out in the fi­nale of the short, yet bru­tal climb up the Puy de Mary, where the av­er­age gra­di­ent rose above 11 per cent.</p>
    <p>Ineos-Gre­nadiers Colom­bian leader Ber­nal, who fares bet­ter on longer as­cents, could not sus­tain the pace when Tadej Po­gacar ac­cel­er­ated, with fel­low Slove­nian Roglic the only rider able to fol­low.</p>
    <p>The duo crossed the line 38 sec­onds ahead of Ber­nal, who slipped to third in the gen­eral clas­si­fi­ca­tion, 59 sec­onds off the pace.</p>
    <p>Roglic: “Of course it was a re­ally nice day, so I’m su­per happy with what I did to­day. Every ex­tra sec­ond is good.</p>
    <p>“Hon­estly, I ex­pected Tadej to be good be­fore the start of the Tour. I knew he is su­per strong.</p>
    <p>“We did na­tion­als to­gether and from last year we al­ready saw he can do re­ally big things in the Vuelta, so it was no big sur­prise. I’m re­ally happy at the end we were two Slove­ni­ans at the top.”</p>
    <p>The 21-year-old Po­gacar, the most ag­gres­sive of the main con­tenders and the best man in the Pyre­nees last week­end, is sec­ond, 44 sec­onds be­hind Roglic.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day’s stage sig­nalled the end of French hopes as Ro­main Bardet, who started the day in fourth place over­all, 30 sec­onds off the pace, ended up 2min 30sec be­hind Roglic af­ter the 2016 run­nerup took a heavy tum­ble. Guil­laume Martin, third over­all at the start, cracked in the penul­ti­mate climb to cross the line 2:46 af­ter Roglic.</p>
    <p>Bardet and Martin are now just out­side the top 10.</p>
    <p>Martinez, who fea­tured among the dark horses be­fore the start in Nice af­ter win­ning the Cri­terium du Dauphine but lost any hope in the first week, out­sprinted Len­nard Kamna for the stage win.</p>
    <p>Martinez said: “When the Tour started my sen­sa­tions were still good, but I fell and lost a bit of time. Men­tally that was hard.</p>
    <p>“I let some more time go and then I tried to seek out stages that suited me. I man­aged to win to­day.”</p>
