    <p>“So when our Sick­ness, and our Poverty had greater wants than we could well sup­ply; Strict Or­ders did but more en­rage our grief, And hin­der in ac­com­plish­ing re­lief.”</p>
    <p>That’s how Bri­tish poet Ge­orge Wither ex­plained a spread­ing re­bel­lion against so­cial dis­tanc­ing rules.</p>
    <p>See­ing quar­an­tines and lock­downs as un­fair and tyran­ni­cal pun­ish­ments, peo­ple were tak­ing to the streets. The year was 1625, the place was Lon­don, the dis­ease was plague. On Nov 7, the same psy­chol­ogy brought some 20,000 peo­ple out on the streets of Leipzig. About 90 per cent of the marchers re­fused to wear masks, ac­cord­ing to po­lice es­ti­mates.</p>
    <p>They rep­re­sented a mot­ley spec­trum of con­spir­acy the­o­rists and free­dom lovers, of right-wing ex­trem­ists and those sim­ply nos­tal­gic for East Ger­many’s peace­ful revolution 31 years ago.</p>
    <p>And this was only the lat­est of many such demon­stra­tions this year, in Ger­many and dozens of other coun­tries.</p>
    <p>Peo­ple have marched, ri­oted or protested from Trafal­gar Square to the Michi­gan State­house, some­times armed with guns.</p>
    <p>DIF­FER­ENT SORTS OF PROTESTS</p>
    <p>The Carnegie En­dow­ment for In­ter­na­tional Peace has counted more than 30 ma­jor protests in 26 coun­tries be­tween March and last month just against coro­n­avirus pan­demic re­stric­tions.</p>
    <p>But the protests in Leipzig or Michi­gan, Bri­tain or Aus­tralia, rep­re­sent only one cat­e­gory of un­rest, reckon Carnegie’s Thomas Carothers and Ben­jamin Press. Th­ese ral­lies vent the frus­tra­tions of rel­a­tively well-off peo­ple liv­ing in pros­per­ous and func­tional democ­ra­cies.</p>
    <p>In a dif­fer­ent cat­e­gory, there are the many protests against gov­ern­ments or lead­ers sus­pected of be­ing cor­rupt (Bul­garia, say), in­com­pe­tent (Brazil) or dem­a­gogic, il­lib­eral and even un­demo­cratic.</p>
    <p>Is­raelis, for ex­am­ple, protested against Prime Min­is­ter Ben­jamin Ne­tanyahu af­ter he shut down courts, ad­journed Par­lia­ment and de­manded dig­i­tal surveil­lance, all in the name of fight­ing the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Ser­bians took to the streets against their pres­i­dent, Mr Alek­san­dar Vu­cic. He had lifted a lockdown to al­low an elec­tion that was in his in­ter­est but ul­ti­mately contribute­d to a resur­gence of the virus. He then im­posed a sec­ond lockdown, which Serbs in­ter­preted as a crack­down on dis­sent.</p>
    <p>A third type of protest is more com­mon in poor coun­tries. It mo­bilises peo­ple not so much be­cause they worry about the virus or democ­racy but be­cause they fear for their liveli­hoods.</p>
    <p>In Malawi, street ven­dors have marched with signs say­ing “We’d rather die of corona than of hunger”. The cit­i­zens of Ecuador have ri­oted against coro­n­avirus poli­cies that threaten to im­pov­er­ish them, in­clud­ing the shut­down of state-owned com­pa­nies and salary cuts.</p>
    <p>And then there are the many protests that os­ten­si­bly have lit­tle to do with Covid-19 but prob­a­bly be­came more ur­gent or bit­ter in the pan­demic’s con­text.</p>
    <p>Black Lives Mat­ter is an up­ris­ing against racial in­jus­tice that restarted in the United States af­ter the death of Mr Ge­orge Floyd. It then spread to at least 16 other coun­tries, from France and Bri­tain to Brazil and South Africa.</p>
    <p>In his­tory books, the iconog­ra­phy of mask-clad crowds will for­ever in­vite as­so­ci­a­tions with the out­break.</p>
    <p>In April, I pre­dicted that “this pan­demic will lead to so­cial rev­o­lu­tions”. What we’ve seen so far is only the start.</p>
    <p>AGE OF MASS PROTESTS</p>
    <p>De­spite new hopes for a vac­cine, Covid-19 will now en­ter its dead­li­est phase in many re­gions en­ter­ing winter. Even af­ter we de­feat the virus, many of its ef­fects will linger for years. Like tur­pen­tine on flames, Covid-19 has rekin­dled older di­vi­sions, re­sent­ments and in­equities across the world.</p>
    <p>In the US, black Amer­i­cans suf­fer dis­pro­por­tion­ately from po­lice bru­tal­ity but also from the coro­n­avirus – now th­ese trau­mas merge. And ev­ery­where, the poor fare worse than the rich.</p>
    <p>In March, still early in the pan­demic, think-tankers were al­ready notic­ing that we were en­ter­ing an “age of mass protests” – the num­ber of up­ris­ings glob­ally has been in­creas­ing by an av­er­age of</p>
    <p>11.5 per cent a year since 2009.</p>
    <p>Covid-19, like so many other plagues be­fore, will now act as the fire ac­cel­er­ant.</p>
    <p>Some up­heavals will top­ple gov­ern­ments, oth­ers will be re­pressed. Some will flare up soon, oth­ers will smoul­der for years.</p>
    <p>In 1381, the ru­ral poor of Eng­land rose up in the so-called Peas­ants’ Re­volt, killing, loot­ing and burn­ing. They did so be­cause their lives had be­come un­liv­able since the Black Death first came ashore 33 years ear­lier.</p>
    <p>And the elites had done noth­ing in that time to make things bet­ter. BLOOMBERG</p>
