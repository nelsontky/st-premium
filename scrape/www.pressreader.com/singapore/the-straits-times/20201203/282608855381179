    <p>THE DIS­CI­PLE (M18, 128 min­utes, opens to­day ex­clu­sively at The Pro­jec­tor)</p>
    <p>Sto­ries about those who chase af­ter mas­tery of their craft are tricky to get right.</p>
    <p>While they come with an en­gine for drama built in – the man or woman is fix­ated on a goal, and the au­di­ence fol­low their soar­ing emo­tional highs or crash­ing lows on the jour­ney (think the Neil Arm­strong biopic First Man, 2018 and the Vin­cent Van Gogh biopic At Eter­nity’s Gate, 2018) – these sto­ries con­tain a struc­tural prob­lem. They have the un­like­abil­ity fac­tor.</p>
    <p>The Dis­ci­ple suf­fers from the same dra­matic is­sue, though it must be said that writer-di­rec­tor Chai­tanya Tamhane works hard to make Sharad (Aditya Modak) re­lat­able, some­one whom the au­di­ence can see in them­selves.</p>
    <p>Sharad is ob­sessed with mastering the art of singing in the In­dian clas­si­cal tra­di­tion. He be­comes a ser­vant of an age­ing vo­cal­ist he adores, puts his life on hold so he can train and study the lives of mu­si­cal gu­rus, and is gen­er­ally out of step with so­ci­ety.</p>
    <p>His pu­ri­tan­i­cal pur­suit of what he con­sid­ers “real” mu­sic – none of that vul­gar Bol­ly­wood movie sound­track rub­bish for him, thank you – makes him a pain in the pos­te­rior for those around him.</p>
    <p>The film lapses into rep­e­ti­tion – how much does the au­di­ence need to know about what a weirdo Sharad can be? – and re­minds view­ers why movies about delu­sional ob­ses­sives tend to be comic satires.</p>
    <p>The tale of the em­peror’s new clothes is an ex­am­ple of how lam­poon­able nar­cis­sists can be.</p>
    <p>The first In­dian work to be en­tered into the main com­pe­ti­tion sec­tion at this year’s Venice Film Festival since Mon­soon Wed­ding (2001), The Dis­ci­ple rises above the un­like­abil­ity prob­lem through the way it presents the mu­sic that is driv­ing its pro­tag­o­nist mad.</p>
    <p>Tamhane clearly loves In­dian clas­si­cal mu­sic and the art form is pre­sented with grace­ful, en­gag­ing de­tail. At times, when look­ing at Sharad’s en­rap­tured face while he lis­tens, his ado­ra­tion of the form is not just clear but also un­der­stand­able.</p>
    <p>What is fam­ily? It is a ques­tion that has vexed film-mak­ers like Ja­pan’s Hirokazu Kore-eda (the dra­mas Shoplifter­s, 2018, and Still Walk­ing, 2008).</p>
    <p>Def­i­ni­tions of what kin­ship is, and in par­tic­u­lar how it de­fines re­spon­si­bil­ity, in­trigues Asian film-mak­ers per­haps be­cause places like Ja­pan and Tai­wan have only rel­a­tively re­cently be­gun to deal with con­cepts such as women’s rights, di­vorce, adop­tion and gay re­la­tion­ships.</p>
    <p>Tai­wanese writer-di­rec­tor Cheng Yu-chieh ex­plores the ground shift­ing be­neath the idea of the tra­di­tional Chi­nese fam­ily in this movie, win­ner of three Golden Horse Awards.</p>
    <p>It opens with a pic­ture of fil­ial de­vo­tion: A man, Lin (Mo Tzu-yi), is in jail. Flash­ing back, he is shown dress­ing the di­a­betic sores on the legs of an older woman, Grandma (Chen Shu-fang). Later we learn he is not her son, just some­one who be­haves like one.</p>
    <p>The story of how Lin, a ten­ant who comes to do more for the older woman than most chil­dren would do for their par­ents, un­folds un­til it gets to the open­ing of Lin in prison.</p>
    <p>Lin’s gay re­la­tion­ship with Grandma’s son is the cause of Lin’s en­tan­gle­ment with the fam­ily.</p>
    <p>There is the added wrin­kle in the form of nine-year-old Yo-yu (Bai Run-yin), his lover’s son with an ex-wife. In the ab­sence of his lover (which is ex­plained in the film),</p>
    <p>Lin is now son to Grandma and father to Yo-yu.</p>
    <p>There are re­la­tion­ships bound by love but not recog­nised in law, as is re­vealed when crim­i­nal charges are brought against Lin.</p>
    <p>Film-maker Cheng be­lieves that the flash­back struc­ture adds dra­matic ten­sion to the story. How­ever, af­ter it be­comes clear early on that Lin will be a mar­tyr in a story that puts him through the wringer – for ex­am­ple, when fac­ing ho­mo­pho­bic cops or judges who ques­tion his mo­tives for car­ing for Grandma and the child – the time-shift­ing struc­ture brings very lit­tle to the ta­ble.</p>
    <p>Cheng’s re­stricted emo­tional pal­ette serves to mainly cast Lin as a tragic fig­ure fac­ing so­cial per­se­cu­tion be­cause of whom he has cho­sen to love.</p>
    <p>The trio of Mo, Chen (they won Best Lead­ing Ac­tor and Best Sup­port­ing Ac­tress re­spec­tively at the Golden Horse Awards) and child ac­tor Bai de­liver great per­for­mances, but Lin’s lack of char­ac­ter shad­ing makes him a dis­tant fig­ure.</p>
    <p>Cheng’s re­fusal to make him any­thing other than a sainted per­son scape­goated by ev­ery­one is weary­ing to watch.</p>
