    <p>•</p>
    <p>NEW YORK For two weeks, all seemed well with the plan to hold the US Open in New York just a few months af­ter the city had be­come the epi­cen­tre for the coron­avirus in the West­ern world.</p>
    <p>With a hand­ful of no­table ex­cep­tions, the best ten­nis play­ers in the world be­gan ar­riv­ing last month, nearly all of them housed at a Long Is­land ho­tel where they were sup­posed to com­ply with strict so­cial dis­tanc­ing rules as they played the West­ern and South­ern Open, the event pre­ced­ing the hard-court Grand Slam.</p>
    <p>Both tour­na­ments were to be held in a “bub­ble” and the plan that the United States Ten­nis As­so­ci­a­tion (USTA) had de­vel­oped closely with city and state pub­lic health of­fi­cials – in­clud­ing bar­ring fans, reg­u­lar test­ing, ed­u­ca­tion, be­hav­iour mon­i­tor­ing and con­tact trac­ing – ap­peared to be work­ing.</p>
    <p>The or­gan­is­ers thought that they had all the bases cov­ered. Then, two days be­fore the US Open, France’s 17th seed Benoit Paire tested pos­i­tive for the coron­avirus.</p>
    <p>Elec­tronic con­tact trac­ing re­vealed that he had been in close con­tact for an ex­tended pe­riod – dur­ing a card game at the ho­tel – with seven play­ers, most of them French, in­clud­ing Kristina Mlade­n­ovic.</p>
    <p>A day af­ter two top men’s sin­gles play­ers had to wait 21/ hours to</p>
    <p>2 find out whether they would be able to take the court, ten­nis of­fi­cials on Sat­ur­day elim­i­nated the top-seeded women’s dou­bles team of Mlade­n­ovic and Timea Ba­bos.</p>
    <p>Health of­fi­cials in Nas­sau County, where the play­ers’ ho­tel is, de­cided that al­low­ing Mlade­n­ovic to play would vi­o­late the county’s pro­to­cols, even though she had been par­tic­i­pat­ing at Flush­ing Mead­ows all week.</p>
    <p>The USTA, which was caught off guard by the county’s sud­den in­volve­ment in the tour­na­ment’s pro­to­cols, said in a state­ment that it was ob­li­gated to com­ply with the rul­ing that all of those who had been in close con­tact with Paire would have to re­main alone in their ho­tel rooms through a quar­an­tine pe­riod that ended on Sat­ur­day.</p>
    <p>It was the third time in less than a week, and the sec­ond time in 24 hours, that the rules for play­ers ex­posed to the virus had changed, with no rea­son given to ex­plain why the county waited five days af­ter Paire was re­moved from the draw to en­force its strin­gent rules.</p>
    <p>“We al­ways knew we were go­ing to have to stay vig­i­lant and mon­i­tor ev­ery­thing ev­ery sin­gle day, be­cause we have learnt how quickly things can change in this Covid-19 world that we are now liv­ing in,” said Chris Wid­maier, spokesman for the USTA.</p>
    <p>Those words were likely to be lit­tle com­fort to Mlade­n­ovic, who ear­lier in the week hit out at the or­gan­is­ers, say­ing the tour­na­ment had be­come a “night­mare” for her.</p>
    <p>The dou­bles world No. 3 did not re­spond to mes­sages on Sat­ur­day, but fourth-ranked dou­bles player Ba­bos and her coach Michael Joyce – both were not di­rectly af­fected by the new quar­an­tine rules – have al­ready flown back to their re­spec­tive homes in Hun­gary and Florida.</p>
    <p>“This prob­a­bly cost us a Grand Slam,” Joyce lamented.</p>
