    <p>Within 180 days of their first pos­i­tive test, peo­ple who have re­cov­ered from Covid-19 and are well will not need to take an anti­gen rapid test that is re­quired be­fore some events in a pilot scheme that will run from this month to De­cem­ber.</p>
    <p>The rea­son is that they are very likely to be im­mune to an­other round of in­fec­tion, based on cur­rent ev­i­dence, said the Min­istry of Health (MOH) at a me­dia brief­ing yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>This pre-event test­ing, which will be piloted at se­lected func­tions such as wed­ding re­cep­tions, live per­for­mances and sports gath­er­ings, com­ple­ments ex­ist­ing safe man­age­ment mea­sures – such as mask-wear­ing, safe dis­tanc­ing, and group size and ca­pac­ity lim­its – and is not meant to re­place them.</p>
    <p>Par­tic­i­pants must test neg­a­tive be­fore they can gain en­try into the event. The test re­sult will be valid for 24 hours.</p>
    <p>Anti­gen rapid tests, which can yield re­sults more quickly, will be used for such test­ing, although they have a lower ac­cu­racy rate com­pared with PCR (poly­merase chain re­ac­tion) tests, which are con­sid­ered de­fin­i­tive tests for con­firm­ing Covid-19 cases.</p>
    <p>The pilot pro­gramme is be­ing done to al­low MOH to study the pro­cesses in­volved to con­duct such test­ing, and for more large-scale events to re­sume even­tu­ally.</p>
    <p>The min­istry said: “At this stage, we are con­fi­dent that for those who have re­cov­ered from an in­fec­tion and re­main well and asymp­to­matic, we don’t think we need to test them for a pe­riod of 180 days.</p>
    <p>“But we’re look­ing very closely at the ev­i­dence as well as the var­i­ous stud­ies we’re do­ing for re­cov­ered peo­ple... to de­ter­mine whether we can safely ex­tend that pe­riod be­yond 180 days and ex­empt peo­ple fur­ther from other tests.”</p>
    <p>This pe­riod of ex­emp­tion ap­plies not just to those in­volved in the pilot scheme, but also to oth­ers who need to do PCR tests, like mi­grant work­ers who have to un­dergo ros­tered rou­tine test­ing ev­ery 14 days.</p>
    <p>MOH added that it is look­ing at data not just from Sin­ga­pore, but also in­ter­na­tion­ally.</p>
    <p>But as the un­der­stand­ing of im­mu­nity to Covid-19 is still evolv­ing, the min­istry said there is a need to act cau­tiously and not ex­tend the pe­riod of ex­emp­tion un­less it is con­fi­dent it can do so.</p>
    <p>“We’re mind­ful that there have been re­ports of re­cur­rent in­fec­tions (else­where)... as the in­ter­val length­ens, there’s al­ways a risk that there will be a few peo­ple with re­cur­ring in­fec­tions com­ing in,” it said. “We’ve not seen that in Sin­ga­pore, but that pos­si­bil­ity al­ways ex­ists and, there­fore, we’re be­ing care­ful.”</p>
