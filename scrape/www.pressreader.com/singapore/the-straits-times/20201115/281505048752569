    <p>It may seem like a sur­pris­ing time to quit a job, but for Ms Joyce Toh, the Covid-19 pandemic jolted her out of her fa­mil­iar job in mu­se­ums and into an in­tern­ship at a start-up.</p>
    <p>Ms Toh, 44, left her job as a se­nior cu­ra­tor in Septem­ber after 13 years as she felt her growth had plateaued. “Some­thing about the pandemic and be­ing at home forced me to think care­fully about what is im­por­tant in life,” she said.</p>
    <p>“If I don’t move now and don’t push my­self now, I’ll never do it. I know that there are things that I want to achieve in life, for my­self and to help oth­ers.”</p>
    <p>While look­ing for op­por­tu­ni­ties in new fields, she felt that most po­si­tions she was in­ter­ested in would re­quire some ex­pe­ri­ence, and many al­ready had hun­dreds of ap­pli­ca­tions. She con­sid­ered try­ing a start-up, as she thought the man­age­ment team would likely be more risk-tak­ing and open to tak­ing on some­one like her.</p>
    <p>It was then that she came across a LinkedIn post by ven­ture builder Creatella for an un­paid po­si­tion. After re­search­ing the com­pany and its founder-cum-chief ex­ec­u­tive Guil­laume Catella, Ms Toh con­tacted him through LinkedIn and fol­lowed up with an e-mail.</p>
    <p>Though Mr Catella said the po­si­tion was too ju­nior for her, they spoke on the phone and Ms Toh gave her pitch. “I want to learn skills and knowl­edge, and make con­tact with like-minded peo­ple who want to im­pact so­ci­ety. I hope to cre­ate a par­a­digm shift in arts, cul­ture or so­cial work to un­lock more value and op­por­tu­ni­ties for peo­ple,” she said.</p>
    <p>Mr Catella said he of­fered her the</p>
    <p>role be­cause her as­pi­ra­tions res­onate with his as she wants to find new ways to cre­ate value, par­tic­u­larly through ed­u­ca­tion. “We try to max­imise di­ver­sity of gen­der, race, na­tion­al­ity, cul­ture and age among our team, as such cre­ative abra­sion brings our team more cre­ativ­ity and open-mind­ed­ness,” he added.</p>
    <p>Ms Toh, who is about a month into her three-month stint and is work­ing on an en­trepreneur­ship boot camp for sec­ondary school stu­dents, said one chal­lenge is get­ting to know her col­leagues as the team is very in­ter­na­tional and in­ter­acts on­line.</p>
    <p>But this has helped her think about how she would keep ev­ery­one mo­ti­vated if she were run­ning her own project in the fu­ture and work­ing with a re­mote team.</p>
    <p>She is also learn­ing about how Creatella or­gan­ises its work­force and what mod­els and mind­sets she can ap­ply in other in­dus­tries or sit­u­a­tions.</p>
    <p>Ms Toh, who is sin­gle, said that un­like peo­ple who are re­trenched, she was able to plan ahead which took away a lot of the fear and un­cer­tainty of the tran­si­tion. The cir­cuit breaker and work-from-home pe­riod al­lowed her to cal­cu­late the cost of her ba­sic needs each month and work out how long she could go with­out an in­come.</p>
    <p>Al­though the in­tern­ship is un­paid and there is a risk that it may not look im­pres­sive to prospec­tive em­ploy­ers, she feels the knowl­edge, skills and con­tacts she will gain are a fair trade-off.</p>
    <p>“Be­ing an in­tern at 44 for some peo­ple might seem em­bar­rass­ing but if you re­cast it, it’s ac­tu­ally a won­der­ful op­por­tu­nity that I’m able to cre­ate on my own terms.”</p>
