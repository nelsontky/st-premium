    <p>An on­go­ing study by lo­cal re­searchers found that the SarsCoV-2 virus, which causes Covid-19, could sur­vive – in suf­fi­ciently high amounts – on frozen fish, chicken and pork for three weeks at re­frig­er­a­tion tem­per­a­ture.</p>
    <p>Co-led by Dr Danielle An­der­son, sci­en­tific di­rec­tor of the Duke-NUS Med­i­cal School ABSL3 lab­o­ra­tory, in col­lab­o­ra­tion with Pro­fes­sor Dale Fisher from the Na­tional Univer­sity of Sin­ga­pore’s Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine, the study was con­ducted to test the “longevity and in­fec­tiv­ity of Sars-CoV-2” in re­frig­er­ated and frozen food.</p>
    <p>High amounts of the virus were used to in­fect pieces of salmon, chicken and pork sourced from lo­cal su­per­mar­kets.</p>
    <p>The sam­ples were stored at three dif­fer­ent tem­per­a­tures: 4 deg C (re­frig­er­a­tion tem­per­a­ture), mi­nus 20 deg C (freezer tem­per­a­ture) and mi­nus 80 deg C (deep freezer tem­per­a­ture gen­er­ally used in labs to pre­serve the virus) re­spec­tively.</p>
    <p>The sam­ples were then har­vested at spec­i­fied time points re­flect­ing food trans­port time­lines. It was found that the virus was able to sur­vive and re­main in­fec­tious at re­frig­er­a­tion and freezer tem­per­a­tures, that is, 4 deg C and mi­nus 20 deg C re­spec­tively, for three weeks.</p>
    <p>Hence, it is pos­si­ble for the virus to sur­vive trans­port and stor­age which oc­cur in con­trolled set­tings with con­sis­tent tem­per­a­ture and hu­mid­ity levels, com­pa­ra­ble to a lab­o­ra­tory set­ting.</p>
    <p>The study also noted that an in­fected food han­dler could be an in­dex case to a new out­break, and such an event – though un­likely – could still oc­cur from time to time.</p>
    <p>The team has re­cently been awarded a re­search grant from the World Health Or­gan­i­sa­tion to fur­ther its study. The team is now test­ing lower amounts of virus on food pack­ag­ing to repli­cate trans­mis­sion oc­cur­ring through an in­fected worker con­tam­i­nat­ing the food or its pack­ag­ing.</p>
    <p>They are also study­ing the pos­si­bil­ity of in­fec­tion by con­sum­ing food that has been con­tam­i­nated with the Covid-19 virus.</p>
