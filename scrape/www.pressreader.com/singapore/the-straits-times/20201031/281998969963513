    <p>If Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump squeezes out an elec­tion win and oc­cu­pies the White House for an­other four years, there is lit­tle doubt there would be pol­icy con­ti­nu­ity, an­a­lysts say.</p>
    <p>While re­ports sug­gest the Pres­i­dent may change his De­fence Sec­re­tary Mark Esper, Sec­re­tary of State Mike Pom­peo will re­main in the Cab­i­net, his loy­alty bur­nished by his beam­ing in from Jerusalem at the Repub­li­can Na­tional Con­ven­tion to sup­port his boss.</p>
    <p>China hawks such as eco­nomic ad­viser Peter Navarro will also re­main in place. And the Pres­i­dent is likely to de­mand more bur­den shar­ing from al­lies in re­turn for troops on their soil – an is­sue for South Korea and Ja­pan – or else he will with­draw some of them.</p>
    <p>The big­ger ques­tion is what to ex­pect in a Joe Bi­den pres­i­dency.</p>
    <p>Broadly, pres­i­dent Bi­den would be a “very tra­di­tional” leader, said Mr Cur­tis Chin, Milken In­sti­tute Asia fel­low and a for­mer United States am­bas­sador to the Asian Devel­op­ment Bank.</p>
    <p>“He grew up re­ally in Wash­ing­ton, DC, in a sense, and he’s been in govern­ment for 40-plus years, and so we’ll see a re­turn, good and bad, to what has been seen as main­stream diplo­macy of an em­brace of in­ter­na­tional or­gan­i­sa­tions, of the norms of tra­di­tional diplo­macy,” Mr Chin told The Straits Times.</p>
    <p>Ad­vis­ers to the for­mer vice-pres­i­dent – and there are many – are gen­er­ally unan­i­mous that, should he win the elec­tion, the ob­jec­tive should be to “re­sus­ci­tate” US diplo­macy and al­liances, and re­store what is seen by them as Amer­ica’s dented lead­er­ship, in part by re-en­gag­ing with mul­ti­lat­eral or­gan­i­sa­tions and in­sti­tu­tions.</p>
    <p>But within those broad out­lines which ev­ery­body is on board with, there are dif­fer­ences over key chal­lenges – and one of the big­gest is China. Among Mr Bi­den’s for­eign pol­icy team and in the Demo­cratic Party, there are those who main­tain that the No. 1 ex­is­ten­tial threat is global warm­ing, and the US must work with China on that – but that this is­sue should be iso­lated from the strate­gic com­pe­ti­tion which re­mains.</p>
    <p>That, how­ever, is an as­pi­ra­tion that may be­come a ca­su­alty of the re­al­i­ties of that great power com­pe­ti­tion – and there are those who recog­nise that as well.</p>
    <p>Whether the two pow­ers can co­op­er­ate on global chal­lenges like cli­mate change and pan­demics is an unan­swered ques­tion.</p>
    <p>While the early days of a Bi­den pres­i­dency will see the US re­turn­ing to mul­ti­lat­er­al­ism by re­join­ing the Paris agree­ment on curb­ing global warm­ing, it may be im­por­tant not to show con­ces­sions to China, some of his ad­vis­ers main­tain, con­tend­ing that it would be seen by Bei­jing as a sign of weak­ness. Bet­ter, they say, to first re­ju­ve­nate at home, and re­store the US’ own lead­er­ship abroad.</p>
    <p>Thus, China in the short term will likely con­tinue to en­counter ro­bust push­back, and cer­tainly more crit­i­cism on hu­man rights.</p>
    <p>The US will con­tinue to sup­ply</p>
    <p>Tai­wan with weapons.</p>
    <p>The trans­ac­tional ap­proach to sta­tion­ing US troops in Ja­pan and South Korea will also be dis­carded; the sta­tus quo will be main­tained and the troops will stay.</p>
    <p>And North Korea’s chair­man Kim Jong Un is likely to find that Mr Bi­den will of­fer a cold shoul­der.</p>
    <p>In­dia may find a Bi­den ad­min­is­tra­tion hard to nav­i­gate af­ter the bon­homie of the Trump pres­i­dency, an­a­lysts say. Tra­di­tion­ally, the Demo­cratic Party raises more hu­man rights con­cerns, and In­dia has al­ready been crit­i­cised by some Demo­cratic law­mak­ers over New Delhi’s ac­tions in Kash­mir.</p>
    <p>“If Bi­den be­comes pres­i­dent, there will be much greater nor­mal­i­sa­tion of high-level pol­icy en­gage­ment with China,” Eura­sia Group founder and pres­i­dent Ian Brem­mer said in an on­line dis­cus­sion this week. “Right now, on the Trump side, re­ally the only place that you have sig­nif­i­cant reg­u­lar high-level con­ver­sa­tions is around the trade deal.”</p>
    <p>He added: “On the na­tional se­cu­rity side, on the tech side, on the cli­mate side, on reg­u­lar di­plo­matic re­la­tions, it is pretty bro­ken (and) episodic.”</p>
    <p>He said: “Bi­den will want to re­turn to that im­me­di­ately. Frankly,</p>
    <p>the first three months of a Bi­den ad­min­is­tra­tion will not be about cre­at­ing a lot of pol­icy on China. It will be sim­ply… re­build­ing the di­a­logue.</p>
    <p>“I also think that Bi­den will reach out, not just to China, but also to ev­ery­one on a very as­sertive cli­mate pol­icy that the Chi­nese would like to be a part of.”</p>
