    <p>The Demo­cratic Party ap­pears poised to re­take con­trol of the United States Se­nate. It had flipped one of two seats in a his­toric vic­tory in a run-off elec­tion in the state of Ge­or­gia and was lead­ing in the other as at press time.</p>
    <p>Demo­crat Raphael Warnock, a 51-year-old pas­tor of civil rights giant Martin Luther King Jr’s former con­gre­ga­tion, will be­come Ge­or­gia’s first black se­na­tor with his de­feat of Repub­li­can in­cum­bent Kelly Lo­ef­fler.</p>
    <p>Demo­crat chal­lenger Jon Os­soff has de­clared vic­tory with a slim lead of 16,000 votes over his Repub­li­can op­po­nent David Per­due, a gap that is ex­pected to widen as re­main­ing votes to be counted come from ar­eas that skew strongly Demo­crat. At 33, he will be Ge­or­gia’s first Jewish se­na­tor and the coun­try’s youngest since Pres­i­dent-elect Joe Bi­den was first elected to the Se­nate in 1973 at age 30.</p>
    <p>The re­sults were a stun­ning turn­around from Novem­ber, when both Democrats polled slightly be­hind the Repub­li­cans.</p>
    <p>They un­der­scored the po­lit­i­cal shift in the for­merly deeply Repub­li­can state of Ge­or­gia, which has not sent a Demo­crat to the Se­nate since 1996, but which voted for Mr Bi­den in Novem­ber af­ter months of cam</p>
    <p>paign­ing and voter regis­tra­tion drives by lo­cal Demo­crat ac­tivists and or­gan­is­ers.</p>
    <p>It could also sig­nal a re­jec­tion of US Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump, who per­son­ally cam­paigned in Ge­or­gia for the Repub­li­can sen­a­tors, and his pol­i­tics of di­vi­sion and strat­egy of falsely al­leg­ing elec­toral fraud. He dou­bled down on Tues­day as Mr Warnock’s vic­tory be­came likely, claim­ing with­out ev­i­dence on Twit­ter that the elec­tion was rigged against Repub­li­cans.</p>
    <p>Mr Warnock paid trib­ute to his mother, re­mark­ing on the im­prob­a­bil­ity of his jour­ney made pos­si­ble “be­cause this is Amer­ica”, as he promised to work for all Ge­or­gians. “The other day, be­cause this is Amer­ica, the 82-year-old hands that used to pick some­body else’s cot­ton went to the polls and picked her youngest son to be a US se­na­tor,” he said in a late-night video mes­sage to sup­port­ers.</p>
    <p>Should the Democrats flip the Se­nate, they will have uni­fied con­trol of Congress and the White House for the first time since 2009, al­beit by the nar­row­est of ma­jori­ties. Both the Democrats and Repub­li­cans will have 50 seats in the Se­nate if Mr Os­soff wins, giv­ing VicePres­i­dent Ka­mala Har­ris the tiebreaker vote.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, Wash­ing­ton braced it­self for high drama yes­ter­day when Congress was to meet to count and an­nounce Mr Bi­den’s Elec­toral Col­lege win. The day was to see in­ter­nal Repub­li­can Party ten­sions erupt into the open in Congress while pro-Trump pro­test­ers took to the streets. But all that would not change Mr Bi­den’s Elec­toral Col­lege vic­tory over Mr Trump – by 306 to 232.</p>
    <p>The House of Rep­re­sen­ta­tives and Se­nate were to meet in a con­sti­tu­tion­ally pre­scribed joint ses­sion sched­uled to start at 1pm yes­ter­day (Sin­ga­pore time 2am to­day) to count the elec­toral votes, all of which have been law­fully cer­ti­fied by the states.</p>
    <p>Mr Mike Pence, as pres­i­dent of the Se­nate, was to pre­side over a roll call of the 50 states and Wash­ing­ton DC. Sealed cer­tifi­cates from each state, con­tain­ing its elec­toral votes, were to be opened and of­fi­cially counted.</p>
    <p>If at least one se­na­tor and one mem­ber of the House of Rep­re­sen­ta­tives ob­ject to a state’s re­sults, both cham­bers would sep­a­rately de­bate the ob­jec­tion and vote on whether to sustain it. To over­turn a re­sult, the House and the Se­nate must agree by a sim­ple ma­jor­ity vote to do so.</p>
    <p>So far, 13 Repub­li­can sen­a­tors and around 140 Con­gress­men had said they will ob­ject to re­sults, likely in at least six states that Mr Bi­den won: Ari­zona, Ge­or­gia, Michi­gan, Ne­vada, Penn­syl­va­nia and Wis­con­sin.</p>
    <p>But 23 Repub­li­can sen­a­tors had said they would not join the ob­jec­tions, which are all but cer­tain to fail, given the Democrats’ con­trol of the House.</p>
