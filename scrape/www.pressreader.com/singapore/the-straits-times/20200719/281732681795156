    <p>The Work­ers’ Party will con­tinue to give “for­ward-look­ing sug­ges­tions for the wel­fare of Sin­ga­pore­ans” de­spite fac­ing re­source con­straints, said party chief Pri­tam Singh.</p>
    <p>He noted yes­ter­day that un­like the Gov­ern­ment, which can tap a 120,000-strong civil ser­vice as a re­source for par­lia­men­tary de­bates, the WP con­tin­ues to rely mainly on its vol­un­teer base for po­lit­i­cal work.</p>
    <p>“The ex­tent to which re­al­is­tic pol­icy al­ter­na­tives can be ad­vanced both in pub­lic and in Par­lia­ment is also a func­tion of the PAP’s ap­proach to demo­cratic pol­i­tics,” said Mr Singh, who has been des­ig­nated Leader of the Op­po­si­tion.</p>
    <p>What re­mains to be seen, he added, is if the Peo­ple’s Ac­tion Party Gov­ern­ment will be­come more open in shar­ing in­for­ma­tion.</p>
    <p>The Alju­nied GRC MP was re­spond­ing to Na­tional De­vel­op­ment Min­is­ter Lawrence Wong, who said in a speech to PAP ac­tivists that the WP “can­not just con­tinue ask­ing the Gov­ern­ment ques­tions”.</p>
    <p>It is also the op­po­si­tion party’s duty to put for­ward se­ri­ous pol­icy al­ter­na­tives to be scru­ti­nised and de­bated, now that it has 10 MPs in Par­lia­ment, Mr Wong added.</p>
    <p>To this, Mr Singh stressed that ques­tion­ing the Gov­ern­ment re­mains a “fun­da­men­tal role of a re­spon­si­ble op­po­si­tion – not just in Sin­ga­pore, but in any par­lia­men­tary democ­racy any­where in the world”.</p>
    <p>“This duty is crit­i­cal in hold­ing the Gov­ern­ment to ac­count and it will re­main fun­da­men­tal to the WP’s work in Par­lia­ment,” he said.</p>
    <p>The WP will also con­tinue to put forth pro­pos­als in the House, he said, cit­ing plans for a re­dun­dancy in­sur­ance scheme and sug­ges­tions for an al­ter­na­tive ap­proach to the Pro­tec­tion from On­line False­hoods and Ma­nip­u­la­tion Act, both of which have been raised in Par­lia­ment pre­vi­ously.</p>
    <p>It will also en­cour­age pub­lic con­ver­sa­tions on top­ics such as the lease de­cay of Hous­ing Board flats, and re­lease pub­lic work­ing pa­pers to high­light is­sues that sig­nif­i­cantly af­fect Sin­ga­pore­ans, he added.</p>
    <p>“This term, our ef­forts in Par­lia­ment are cen­tred on key breadand-but­ter con­cerns; jobs for Sin­ga­pore­ans, health­care for our se­niors and more gen­er­ally, cost of liv­ing con­cerns, among oth­ers,” Mr Singh said.</p>
    <p>“A key as­pect of our fo­cus will cover po­lit­i­cal is­sues that have a di­rect im­pact on trans­parency, ac­count­abil­ity, bal­ance and fair­ness.”</p>
    <p>Mr Singh also noted in his re­sponse to Mr Wong that the WP re­mains far from its medium-term goal of se­cur­ing one-third of the elected seats in Par­lia­ment. This would re­quire the party to have 32 elected MPs, and mean that the PAP would no longer be able to muster the two-thirds ma­jor­ity needed to change the Con­sti­tu­tion at will.</p>
    <p>“Even so, such an out­come would still give the rul­ing party a very strong man­date with 61 elected seats, al­low­ing it to ad­vance its agenda and poli­cies,” Mr Singh said.</p>
    <p>The WP’s 10 MPs cur­rently rep­re­sent about 11 per cent of the elected seats in Par­lia­ment. In com­par­i­son, its six MPs held just un­der 7 per cent of seats af­ter the 2015 elec­tion.</p>
    <p>Said Mr Singh: “What­ever the ex­pec­ta­tions the PAP has of the WP, the WP’s pur­pose and ap­proach in Par­lia­ment is to ad­vance and achieve bet­ter out­comes for Sin­ga­pore, and to cham­pion the wel­fare of Sin­ga­pore­ans. We will re­main stead­fast and fully com­mit­ted to that cause.”</p>
