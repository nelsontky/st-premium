    <p>CHENGDU • Staff of the US con­sulate in Chengdu made final ef­forts to clear the premises yes­ter­day, as se­cu­rity re­mained tight out­side, ahead of to­day’s clo­sure or­dered by Bei­jing amid wors­en­ing China-US re­la­tions.</p>
    <p>Out­side the fa­cil­ity on a tree­lined street on a hot day, on­look­ers shared side­walk space with dozens of uni­formed and plain­clothes po­lice op­po­site the en­trance.</p>
    <p>Con­sulate clo­sures in Hous­ton and Chengdu have es­ca­lated a sharp de­te­ri­o­ra­tion in ties be­tween the world’s two big­gest economies, which were al­ready at their worst in decades amid dis­putes over trade and tech­nol­ogy, the han­dling of the Covid-19 pan­demic, China’s ter­ri­to­rial claims in the South China Sea and its clam­p­down on Hong Kong.</p>
    <p>Po­lice asked peo­ple to move on when crowds formed out­side the con­sulate, as on­look­ers took pho­tos and videos of what they ex­pected would be the last time to see the com­pound in US hands. The street was closed to traf­fic, ex­cept for con­sular or po­lice ve­hi­cles.</p>
    <p>China last Fri­day or­dered the clo­sure of the Chengdu con­sulate in the south-western prov­ince of Sichuan. That means an evac­u­a­tion dead­line of 10am to­day, ac­cord­ing to the edi­tor of a state-run tabloid.</p>
    <p>In Hous­ton on Fri­day, a group of men ac­com­pa­nied by a US State Depart­ment of­fi­cial were seen forc­ing open a door at the Chi­nese con­sulate, shortly af­ter the US clo­sure or­der took ef­fect for a fa­cil­ity that Sec­re­tary of State Mike Pom­peo called “a hub of spy­ing and in­tel­lec­tual prop­erty theft”.</p>
    <p>A coach that was on the Chengdu con­sulate premises on Satur­day left yes­ter­day morn­ing. It was un­clear who or what was inside.</p>
    <p>Since Fri­day, staff have been seen com­ing and go­ing, in­clud­ing at least one with a suit­case. Removal vans en­tered and left on Satur­day and yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>“China’s re­sponse was re­cip­ro­cal,” said a 63-year-old lo­cal res­i­dent who gave only his sur­name, Yang. The sit­u­a­tion “is quite re­gret­table.”</p>
