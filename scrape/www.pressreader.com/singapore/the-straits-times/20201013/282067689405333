    <p>This is the new look of some of the trains that will run on the North­South and East-West lines (NSEWL) from 2022.</p>
    <p>Rail com­pany Bom­bardier Trans­porta­tion last Fri­day un­veiled the six-car Movia metro trains, which will have more open spa­ces for wheel­chairs and strollers.</p>
    <p>It said the train’s de­sign was “in­spired by Sin­ga­pore’s vi­brant charm” and that the new trains will re­duce main­te­nance costs and in­crease en­ergy ef­fi­ciency, “meet­ing the high­est en­vi­ron­men­tal stan­dards”.</p>
    <p>Pur­chased by the Land Trans­port Author­ity (LTA) in 2018 and last month, 106 of these trains will even­tu­ally run on the NSEWL by 2026, phas­ing out the first three gen­er­a­tions of trains.</p>
    <p>Ideas about how the old trains can be pre­served for pos­ter­ity are still be­ing ex­plored.</p>
    <p>Sixty-six of the new trains were bought in 2018 for $1.2 bil­lion, with the deal in­clud­ing a ser­vice con­tract.</p>
    <p>Last month, an­other 40 trains were pur­chased for $337.8 mil­lion.</p>
    <p>The new trains are part of the LTA’s on­go­ing ef­forts to re­new the two MRT lines, which have been op­er­at­ing since 1987.</p>
    <p>In tan­dem with the lat­est pur­chase of the trains last month, SMRT, which runs the NSEWL, also signed a con­tract with Bom­bardier Trans­porta­tion for it to pro­vide tech­ni­cal sup­port and spare parts for train re­pairs and sys­tem up­grades or re­place­ments for the first 10 years.</p>
    <p>This can be fur­ther ex­tended for an­other 20 years later.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore now houses one of Bom­bardier’s largest metro fleets in the world.</p>
    <p>Mr Ja­yaram Naidu, Bom­bardier Trans­porta­tion’s pres­i­dent of South-east Asia, said: “We are look­ing to fur­ther col­lab­o­rate with the LTA to in­tro­duce our glob­ally game-chang­ing metro trains to help en­hance the travel ex­pe­ri­ence, re­duce en­ergy con­sump­tion and im­prove rail re­li­a­bil­ity in Sin­ga­pore.”</p>
