    <p>Many of the 23 food and bev­er­age (F&B) out­lets that breached safe man­age­ment rules on the weekend had more than five cus­tomers seated to­gether or min­gling be­tween ta­bles, while oth­ers were serv­ing al­co­hol past 10.30pm. The Min­istry of Sus­tain­abil­ity and the En­vi­ron­ment yes­ter­day out­lined some of the breaches:</p>
    <p>A Chi­na­town eatery ac­cepted a book­ing of 10 cus­tomers and seated them at two ta­bles in a pri­vate din­ing room, but staff told en­force­ment of­fi­cials that the peo­ple did not know one an­other.</p>
    <p>Six peo­ple were caught drink­ing at an Orchard Road out­let around mid­night. Of­fi­cers had heard loud con­ver­sa­tions from the premises, which were locked, and told the F&B op­er­a­tor to open the door but they found no sign of drinks on the ta­ble. Closed-cir­cuit tele­vi­sion footage later showed the cus­tomers and owner clear­ing the glasses and hid­ing the al­co­hol just be­fore open­ing the door to the of­fi­cers.</p>
    <p>A group of 15 cus­tomers were seated across four ta­bles at an F&B out­let in the Boat Quay area for a planned din­ner and were min­gling be­tween ta­bles.</p>
    <p>Eight peo­ple were seated to­gether at a long ta­ble at an out­let in Jurong East.</p>
    <p>The min­istry said: “Din­ing out is an ac­tiv­ity that in­volves con­sid­er­able risks be­cause it en­tails gath­er­ing in en­closed spa­ces, with­out masks on, and for a pro­longed du­ra­tion. We will not hes­i­tate to take firm en­force­ment ac­tion.”</p>
