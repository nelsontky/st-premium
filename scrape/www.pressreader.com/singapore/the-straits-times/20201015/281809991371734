    <p>North Korean leader Kim Jong Un promised to build at least 25,000 homes over the next five years as cit­i­zens be­gin an 80-day cam­paign to achieve eco­nomic goals de­spite grow­ing crises, state me­dia said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>North Korea has had a tough year grap­pling with ty­phoons that bat­tered towns, in­ter­na­tional sanc­tions and the im­pact of anti-coro­n­avirus mea­sures, de­spite no re­ports of in­fec­tions, to the dis­be­lief of US and South Korean of­fi­cials.</p>
    <p>Vis­it­ing one of the ar­eas worst hit by re­cent ty­phoons, Mr Kim ex­pressed re­gret over the decades­old homes that were de­stroyed and urged the mil­i­tary to come up with a more am­bi­tious con­struc­tion plan, state news agency KCNA said.</p>
    <p>The visit came af­ter Mr Kim ap­peared to shed tears at the week­end when thank­ing cit­i­zens for their sac­ri­fices, in the most strik­ing demon­stra­tion yet of how he is re­ly­ing on his “man-of-the-peo­ple” im­age to tackle the crises.</p>
    <p>Last week, Mr Kim called for an 80-day “speed” cam­paign to at­tain eco­nomic goals be­fore a congress in Jan­uary that will de­cide on a new five-year plan.</p>
    <p>“Work­ers in all sec­tors and units of the na­tional econ­omy are com­ing out in the all-out cam­paign,”</p>
    <p>KCNA said yes­ter­day, adding that the ef­fort fo­cuses on boost­ing pro­duc­tion of un­spec­i­fied ma­te­ri­als and equip­ment, har­vest­ing sea­sonal crops, storm re­lief work and steps to pre­vent a virus out­break.</p>
    <p>An­a­lysts say such cam­paigns, which re­quire cit­i­zens to pro­vide “vol­un­tary” ex­tra l abour, are a com­mon, short-term re­sort for North Korean lead­ers aim­ing to re­solve eco­nomic woes.</p>
    <p>The mil­i­tary was more than half­way to its goal of build­ing 2,300 houses in South Ham­gy­ong prov­ince, north-east of the cap­i­tal, Pyongyang, state me­dia said.</p>
    <p>Mr Kim called for a “revo­lu­tion” in con­struc­tion plans, start­ing with build­ing 25,000 houses dur­ing the five-year plan set to be un­veiled in Jan­uary.</p>
    <p>Mr Kim ex­pressed re­gret over the decades-old homes that were de­stroyed and urged the mil­i­tary to come up with a more am­bi­tious con­struc­tion plan, state news agency KCNA said.</p>
