    <p>The coro­n­avirus pan­demic has re­sulted in seismic shifts in hu­man be­hav­iour glob­ally and has had a sig­nif­i­cant – and pos­i­tive – im­pact on the en­vi­ron­ment.</p>
    <p>Air pol­lu­tion, for ex­am­ple, has dropped by nearly 50 per cent in New York, while car­bon emis­sions in China fell by around 25 per cent when it was on par­tial lock­down at the be­gin­ning of the year.</p>
    <p>As coun­tries be­gin to emerge from var­i­ous states of lock­down, many peo­ple are look­ing to play their part in sus­tain­ing those im­prove­ments for the en­vi­ron­ment. This could mean us­ing more en­vi­ron­men­tally friendly prod­ucts or re­cy­cling more.</p>
    <p>These changes will make a dif­fer­ence, but to achieve real im­pact, we need to think a lot big­ger and at a global level.</p>
    <p>Ap­prox­i­mately 70 per cent of cli­mate emis­sions since the 1980s came from just 100 com­pa­nies.</p>
    <p>Multi­na­tion­als have a far greater im­pact on the world en­vi­ron­ment than we do as in­di­vid­u­als, due to the scale at which they op­er­ate and the re­sources they bring to bear.</p>
    <p>To see pos­i­tive change re­alised on a larger scale, it is es­sen­tial that cor­po­ra­tions lead the charge.</p>
    <p>But this doesn’t mean that there is noth­ing we, as in­di­vid­u­als, can do to im­prove the world around us.</p>
    <p>Large com­pa­nies may be the most con­se­quen­tial play­ers on the global stage, but they are be­holden to a far greater force: cap­i­tal.</p>
    <p>Any pub­lic com­pany needs to at­tract the in­ter­est of prospec­tive in­vestors and sat­isfy the de­mands of ex­ist­ing share­hold­ers.</p>
    <p>As a re­sult, com­pa­nies (and oc­ca­sion­ally gov­ern­ments) be­have in the way that they be­lieve cap­i­tal al­lo­ca­tors want them to be­have.</p>
    <p>This pro­vides in­di­vid­u­als with an im­por­tant tool to en­act change: their in­vest­ments. If the life blood of the mar­ket­place is cap­i­tal, then cap­i­tal al­lo­ca­tion goes right to its heart.</p>
    <p>CHANG­ING THE WORLD THROUGH IN­VEST­MENT</p>
    <p>Where you place your in­vest­ments can im­pact the en­vi­ron­ment in two ways.</p>
    <p>First, shares pro­vide own­er­ship of or­gan­i­sa­tions and with that comes in­flu­ence. As a shareholde­r, you can speak to ex­ec­u­tives, vote for or against strate­gic de­ci­sions and elect direc­tors.</p>
    <p>Sec­ond, in­vest­ment acts as a sig­nal and an in­cen­tive. It sig­nals the kind of be­hav­iour that in­vestors want to see and in­cen­tivises such be­hav­iour by re­ward­ing it with cap­i­tal in­jec­tion, or lack thereof, un­der any form.</p>
    <p>And yet, in­vest­ment choice is still over­looked when con­sid­er­ing ac­tions to “do the right thing”.</p>
    <p>Peo­ple ei­ther don’t in­vest at all, or in­vest with­out con­sid­er­a­tion for the power that they wield. In­vest­ing in com­pa­nies that have higher en­vi­ron­men­tal, so­cial and gov­er­nance (ESG) rat­ings could im­prove both peo­ple’s fi­nances as well as the en­vi­ron­ment they live in.</p>
    <p>Fur­ther, re­cent re­search shows that ESG funds have out­per­formed their peers dur­ing the Covid-19 cri­sis and that com­pany per­for­mance and ESG rat­ings have been pos­i­tively cor­re­lated dur­ing the first half of this year.</p>
    <p>While this is a short ob­ser­va­tion pe­riod and might not be the last word on this, there has been no se­ri­ous aca­demic re­search that has found neg­a­tive im­pact to re­turns from ESG-con­scious in­vest­ing.</p>
    <p>Naysay­ers will point to green­wash­ing and other fail­ings of ESG-led ef­forts. These is­sues are real and must be ad­dressed.</p>
    <p>Yet, to this for­mer quant eq­uity man­ager, this sounds a lot like the ob­jec­tions heard in the 1980s and 1990s: al­legedly, the data­bases we used were never good enough, and sure enough, they weren’t per­fect.</p>
    <p>Those is­sues were dealt with, the world moved on, and what was cut­ting edge then is ev­ery­day prac­tice to­day. I ex­pect the same with ESG.</p>
    <p>For peo­ple who might not have the time for di­rect ac­tivism, or find it to be a huge ef­fort for lit­tle im­pact, pool­ing cap­i­tal through di­ver­si­fied funds is a good ap­proach.</p>
    <p>Fund man­agers can iden­tify com­pa­nies with the most at­trac­tive sus­tain­abil­ity char­ac­ter­is­tics. This out­sources the work of iden­ti­fy­ing the right in­vest­ments and cre­ates added clout by group­ing the cap­i­tal of many in­di­vid­u­als to­gether.</p>
    <p>It also en­sures breadth of im­pact across many dif­fer­ent com­pa­nies, in­dus­tries and coun­tries.</p>
    <p>For a fund to be con­sid­ered sus­tain­able, it must do at least one (but prefer­ably sev­eral) of the fol­low­ing: pos­i­tive/neg­a­tive screen­ing; in­te­grate sus­tain­abil­ity con­cerns into fi­nan­cial anal­y­sis; ac­tively en­gage with com­pany man­age­ment; and screen in­vest­ments against stan­dards of busi­ness prac­tices and dis­clo­sure.</p>
    <p>Align­ing our choice of in­vest­ments to our prin­ci­ples, be­liefs and ethics can be one of the most ef­fec­tive ways to in­flu­ence cor­po­ra­tions and gov­ern­ments, who are them­selves the most sig­nif­i­cant ves­sels of power.</p>
    <p>Cap­i­tal al­lo­ca­tion through in­di­vid­ual in­vest­ment is not the only so­lu­tion, but it may be one of the most im­por­tant.</p>
    <p>Af­ter all, money talks, so maybe it is time that we put our money where our mouth is.</p>
