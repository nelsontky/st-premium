    <p>The top five jobs most com­monly of­fered by start-ups as part of the SGUnited Jobs and Skills pro­grammes are soft­ware de­vel­op­ers, chefs, engi­neers, sales, mar­ket­ing and busi­ness de­vel­op­ment man­agers, and ad­min­is­tra­tive and re­lated as­so­ciate pro­fes­sion­als, said the Min­istry of Man­power yes­ter­day in its weekly jobs sit­u­a­tion re­port.</p>
    <p>These five job roles pay a me­dian monthly salary of be­tween $2,700 and $6,000.</p>
    <p>Other jobs on of­fer from the start-ups range from those that are tech-re­lated such as app de­vel­op­ers to non-tech ones like sous chefs.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, Man­power Min­is­ter Josephine Teo said in a new weekly jobs sit­u­a­tion re­port that more than 4,600 jobs and 860 trainee­ships in some 1,600 start-ups are avail­able to lo­cal job seek­ers.</p>
    <p>Speak­ing at the Sin­ga­pore Man­age­ment Univer­sity’s In­sti­tute of Innovation and En­trepreneur­ship, Mrs Teo ad­dressed two mis­con­cep­tions about work­ing in start-ups.</p>
    <p>“Some may have the mis­con­cep­tion that start-ups pay be­low the in­dus­try norm – that is not true,” said Mrs Teo, not­ing that the me­dian salaries for each of the top five roles that they are hir­ing are in line with the in­dus­try norm.</p>
    <p>An­other mis­con­cep­tion, she said, is that the start-up scene is filled with young en­trepreneur­s. “In gen­eral, many of the roles are en­try-level, but that does not mean that mid-ca­reer in­di­vid­u­als with very rich ex­pe­ri­ence can­not thrive in start-ups,” said Mrs Teo, who noted there are ca­reer con­ver­sion pro­grammes like the Pro­fes­sional Con­ver­sion Pro­grammes that of­fer train­ing in the rel­e­vant skill sets re­quired.</p>
    <p>Be­tween April and June this year, about 330 job seek­ers joined star­tups with sup­port from the SGUnited Jobs and Skills Pack­age. About half were mid-ca­reer work­ers who took part in the Pro­fes­sional Con­ver­sion Pro­grammes. At the same time, about 150 fresh and re­cent grad­u­ates en­tered the startup scene through the SGUnited Trainee­ships Pro­gramme.</p>
    <p>Mrs Teo said that job seek­ers who need help nav­i­gat­ing these op­por­tu­ni­ties may ap­proach Work­force Sin­ga­pore (WSG) or the NTUC’s Em­ploy­ment and Em­ploy­a­bil­ity In­sti­tute (e2i).</p>
    <p>Last month, both WSG and e2i reached more than 16,000 job seek­ers, and e2i reached out to more than 2,800 job seek­ers through 22 outreach and en­gage­ment ac­tiv­i­ties.</p>
