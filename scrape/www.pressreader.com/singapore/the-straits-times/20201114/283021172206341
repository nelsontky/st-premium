    <p>Why Nis­san Mo­tor picked the name of a fic­ti­tious 18th-cen­tury Span­ish bar­ber for its lit­tle retro 2+2 seater is a mys­tery.</p>
    <p>The Fi­garo has noth­ing to do with the Ital­ian opera bear­ing its name.</p>
    <p>But to two sis­ters, who each own one, the Nis­san semi-con­vert­ible is no less larger than life.</p>
    <p>Ms Lina Yew, 66 a ship­ping ex­ec­u­tive deal­ing with sport­ing goods, has a light green car, while Ms Yew Lei May, 63, a gen­eral man­ager of a com­pany which dis­trib­utes chem­i­cals for the elec­tron­ics in­dus­try, owns a pas­tel blue one. Both rides cost around $120,000 each.</p>
    <p>Theirs are the only two units of Fi­garo here, pur­chased from a grey im­porter. Nis­san agent Tan Chong Mo­tor did not im­port the model.</p>
    <p>Ms Lina Yew bought the car first, in 1994. She and her hus­band saw it at a used car deal­er­ship and “thought it was sim­ply the cutest thing on four wheels”, she re­calls. She bought it im­me­di­ately.</p>
    <p>“When I showed my new wheels to my younger sis­ter, she wanted one too.”</p>
    <p>So she sold the car to her sis­ter and the same used-car dealer soon found her an­other one.</p>
    <p>Nis­san made only around 20,000 Fi­garos, so the sis­ters’ rides may well be­come clas­sics.</p>
    <p>The Fi­garo al­ready has a cult fol­low­ing. The Fi­garo Own­ers Club and the Fi­garo Spares Com­pany, both in the United King­dom, pro</p>
    <p>vide own­ers around the world with tech­ni­cal sup­port and re­place­ment parts.</p>
    <p>Based on the first-gen­er­a­tion Nis­san March, the Fi­garo was the prod­uct of a spe­cial projects team that was tasked with de­sign­ing niche ve­hi­cles with charm­ing retro el­e­ments.</p>
    <p>The front-wheel-drive Fi­garo has a one-litre four-cylin­der Nis­san March en­gine that is tur­bocharged to pro­duce 75hp. That is suf­fi­cient power for some­thing that weighs less than 850kg.</p>
    <p>Even to­day, the Fi­garo does not need to work hard to keep up with traf­fic.</p>
    <p>Its styling is mildly rem­i­nis­cent of old-school Amer­i­can Ford coupes, but it is much smaller.</p>
    <p>The Yew sis­ters are es­pe­cially charmed by the car’s 1950s-style in­te­rior, with its pre­dom­i­nantly white dash­board, and just the right amount of chrome. The ra­dio, steer­ing wheel and shift lever for the car’s au­to­matic gear­box are also white.</p>
    <p>Ms Lina Yew’s grown-up chil</p>
    <p>dren – two daugh­ters and a son – were in their teens when she brought the Fi­garo home, and “fell in love with the car”.</p>
    <p>They took turns to ride in the tiny car with a tight sec­ond row. “We have taken rides down Or­chard Road with the hood down to take in the Christ­mas lights,” Ms Yew says.</p>
    <p>“It was a tight squeeze but ev­ery­one en­joyed it. We al­ways got looks while driv­ing the Fi­garo. Some driv­ers will honk and some will wave or give us the thumbs-up.</p>
    <p>“To­day, I have six grand­chil­dren and the joyrides con­tinue.”</p>
    <p>Her sis­ter and her hus­band do not have any chil­dren, but she takes her friends’ chil­dren for rides in her Fi­garo.</p>
    <p>“The kids ab­so­lutely love it,” she says. “They see it as a life-size toy car. With the slid­ing can­vas top folded away, they can stand over the roof while on the move.”</p>
    <p>“And when men stop to talk to me when I’m in the Fi­garo, it’s only to ask about this cute ma­chine, never to check me out,” she laughs.</p>
