    <p>The Min­istry of Man­power (MOM) has drawn a clear line be­tween for­eign em­ploy­ees brought in from over­seas of­fices of multi­na­tional cor­po­ra­tions (MNCs) and other Em­ploy­ment Pass (EP) Hold­ers.</p>
    <p>Since Novem­ber last year, such em­ploy­ees, who are known as in­tra-cor­po­rate trans­fer­ees, are be­ing told that they can­not bring their fam­ily mem­bers to Sin­ga­pore via de­pen­dant’s passes or longterm visit passes.</p>
    <p>EP hold­ers are al­lowed to do this if they meet the qual­i­fy­ing cri­te­ria.</p>
    <p>The rule does not, how­ever, ap­ply to in­tra-cor­po­rate trans­fer­ees if they come from coun­tries that have a free trade agree­ment (FTA) with Sin­ga­pore that stip­u­lates that they can bring their fam­i­lies with them.</p>
    <p>In­tra-cor­po­rate trans­fer­ees are also now be­ing told that they will not be al­lowed to re­main in Sin­ga­pore for a lim­ited pe­riod to find a new job if their work passes have been can­celled – un­like EP hold­ers who can do so if they meet spe­cific cri­te­ria.</p>
    <p>Such in­tra-cor­po­rate trans­fer­ees are a com­mon FTA fea­ture glob­ally that al­low for the move­ment of pro­fes­sion­als for short pe­ri­ods to set up of­fices or for ad hoc pro­jects, for ex­am­ple.</p>
    <p>MOM told The Straits Times that EP ap­pli­cants who wish to en­ter Sin­ga­pore as in­tra-cor­po­rate trans­fer­ees are sub­ject to con­di­tions con­sis­tent with Sin­ga­pore’s ex­ist­ing in­ter­na­tional obli­ga­tions. These have not changed.</p>
    <p>“Go­ing for­ward, such in­tra-cor­po­rate trans­feree ap­pli­cants could con­sider ap­ply­ing as reg­u­lar EPs in­stead... Ap­pli­cants should keep in mind the dif­fer­ent con­di­tions that ap­ply be­fore they sub­mit their work pass ap­pli­ca­tions,” MOM said. The spokesman added that the changes are for “neater ad­min­is­tra­tion of work passes”.</p>
    <p>In­tra-cor­po­rate trans­fer­ees make up less than 5 per cent of EP hold­ers here.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to MOM’s web­site, there were 189,700 EP hold­ers as at June last year, down from 193,700 in De­cem­ber 2019.</p>
    <p>The changes, ob­servers said, could re­duce the num­ber of de­pen­dant’s pass hold­ers en­ter­ing Sin­ga­pore, and send a stronger sig­nal that MNCs have to give con­sid­er­a­tion to hir­ing lo­cals be­fore trans­fer­ring a for­eign em­ployee here.</p>
    <p>Mr Ng Zhao Yang, a lo­cal prin­ci­pal with the em­ploy­ment prac­tice of Baker McKen­zie Wong & Leow, said the changes make clear that in­tra-cor­po­rate trans­fer­ees “would not have the same priv­i­leges as other EP hold­ers”.</p>
    <p>This would likely dis­cour­age em­ploy­ers from ap­ply­ing for EPs via the in­tra-cor­po­rate trans­fer route, which is ex­empt from the Fair Con­sid­er­a­tion Frame­work (FCF).</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to em­ploy­ment agents, such in­tra-cor­po­rate trans­fers are gen­er­ally pro­cessed faster than EPs ap­plied for un­der the reg­u­lar route, where jobs have to be posted on the MyCa­reer­sFu­ture.sg por­tal for at least 28 days as part of the FCF be­fore the com­pany can ap­ply for an EP.</p>
    <p>The is­sue of in­tra-cor­po­rate trans­fers came un­der the spot­light last year, with crit­ics ar­gu­ing that FTAs like the In­dia-Sin­ga­pore Com­pre­hen­sive Eco­nomic Co­op­er­a­tion Agree­ment (Ceca) have en­abled size­able num­bers of In­dian IT work­ers to move here as in­tra­cor­po­rate trans­fer­ees.</p>
    <p>But the Min­istry of Trade and In­dus­try (MTI) clar­i­fied last year that Ceca does not give In­dian na­tion­als au­to­matic ac­cess to ci­ti­zen­ship, per­ma­nent res­i­dence or em­ploy­ment in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>MTI has also said it is mis­lead­ing to at­tribute the num­ber of In­dian pro­fes­sion­als, man­agers and ex­ec­u­tives, es­pe­cially in­tra-cor­po­rate trans­fer­ees, solely or mainly to Ceca. In­tra-cor­po­rate trans­fer­ees here “come from a wide range of dif­fer­ent source coun­tries, with In­dian na­tion­als con­sti­tut­ing only a small seg­ment”, it said then.</p>
    <p>In­tra-cor­po­rate trans­fer­ees must still meet the EP cri­te­ria, as well as have in­dus­try ex­pe­ri­ence, and must have worked in the par­ent com­pany for a min­i­mum du­ra­tion.</p>
    <p>In­tra-cor­po­rate trans­fer­ees’ fam­ily mem­bers can still ap­ply for de­pen­dant’s passes or long-term visit passes if they are cov­ered by an ap­pli­ca­ble FTA and meet pre­vail­ing cri­te­ria. This refers to work­ers from In­dia and Aus­tralia, un­der Ceca and the Sin­ga­pore-Aus­tralia Free Trade Agree­ment.</p>
    <p>Dr David Leong, man­ag­ing di­rec­tor of hu­man re­source firm Peo­pleWorld­wide Con­sult­ing, said the re­cent changes are sig­nif­i­cant, as many in­tra-cor­po­rate trans­fer­ees come from other coun­tries that are af­fected by the changes.</p>
    <p>“They send a strong sig­nal that such in­tra-cor­po­rate trans­fer­ees are a tran­sient pres­ence in Sin­ga­pore – they come here to do a job, and then they go back,” he said, adding that this move could slow the in­flow of de­pen­dant’s pass hold­ers.</p>
    <p>Labour MP Pa­trick Tay, who had called for greater trans­parency on in­tra-cor­po­rate trans­fers, said the changes are “an en­cour­ag­ing step to­wards en­sur­ing that our Sin­ga­porean work­ers are not bereft of a fair chance for jobs and op­por­tu­ni­ties”.</p>
    <p>“While we can­not af­ford to close our doors to for­eign pro­fes­sion­als that may bring with them spe­cialised skill sets, we must con­tinue to guard against dis­crim­i­na­tory hir­ing,” he added.</p>
