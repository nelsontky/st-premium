    <p>•</p>
    <p>Manch­ester United would be “stupid” to look at the ta­ble and con­sider them­selves ti­tle con­tenders with more than half the sea­son still to play, Marcus Rash­ford said after Tues­day’s 1-0 Premier League win over Wolves lifted them to sec­ond.</p>
    <p>With the game at Old Traf­ford head­ing for a drab draw, the 23-year-old un­leashed a shot that took a de­flec­tion off Ro­main Saiss and beat Rui Pa­tri­cio in the third minute of stop­page time.</p>
    <p>United, now nine games un­beaten in the league, climbed two places to sec­ond be­hind cham­pi­ons Liver­pool with 30 points from 15 games but Rash­ford was re­luc­tant to read too much into their po­si­tion at this stage.</p>
    <p>“We can’t look too far ahead,” he told Ama­zon Prime.</p>
    <p>“We’re a team that’s still do­ing a lot of work on our­selves and to be look­ing at the ta­ble so early on in the sea­son is a bit stupid of us.</p>
    <p>“We have to take it one game at a time and if we can keep find­ing ways to win, we’ll see where we are at the end of the sea­son.”</p>
    <p>Man­ager Ole Gun­nar Sol­sk­jaer echoed the Eng­land for­ward’s views.</p>
    <p>“You can lose the chance of be­ing in the race in the first 10 games of course, but play an­other 15 and get to 30 maybe, then we can start talk­ing about it when we’ve at least played more than half the sea­son,” the Nor­we­gian added.</p>
    <p>“The be­lief is there, they think, ‘We can win against any­one, any­where’. This re­sult is mas­sive for the at­ti­tude.”</p>
    <p>But while Sol­sk­jaer played down talk of a first ti­tle since 2012-13 – Alex Fer­gu­son’s l ast sea­son i n charge – he ad­mit­ted he was en­cour­aged by what he has seen this term.</p>
    <p>De­spite some mixed results, in­clud­ing a shock exit from the Cham­pi­ons League, he be­lieves his play­ers are ma­tur­ing nicely.</p>
    <p>“It’s the first win in the league for me against them. There have never been many goals in the games but for me, this is a big step for­ward, that you don’t play well but you win,” Sol­sk­jaer said. “It was a point we brought up early in the sea­son in a meet­ing. We didn’t win many points to­wards the end of games (last term) and we have a tra­di­tion for it at this club.</p>
    <p>“That has hap­pened so many times at that end and now, we have won quite a few points to­wards the end of games, and that is both a men­tal and phys­i­cal as­pect.</p>
    <p>“We’ve got a group now that is more ro­bust, both men­tally and phys­i­cally. We have gone through some tough train­ing pe­ri­ods, played loads of games and they are get­ting fit­ter and fit­ter.</p>
    <p>“The fit­ter you are, the more you can do. But men­tally as well, it gives you a boost know­ing you can win games to­wards the end.</p>
    <p>“We didn’t per­form as well as we wanted to but we won a game against a very dif­fi­cult side to play against.”</p>
    <p>THE WIN­NING MEN­TAL­ITY</p>
    <p>The fit­ter you are, the more you can do. But men­tally as well, it gives you a boost know­ing you can win games to­wards the end.</p>
