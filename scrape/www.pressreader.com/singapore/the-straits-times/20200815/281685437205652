    <p>Un­like Changi Air­port, the sea port of Sin­ga­pore has been more re­silient amid the Covid-19 pan­demic as it stays open to the move­ment of con­tainer boxes of cargo.</p>
    <p>Con­tainer through­put in the first half of this year has re­mained ro­bust com­pared with the same pe­riod last year, dip­ping to 17.8 mil­lion twenty-foot equiv­a­lent units (TEUs) against 18 mil­lion TEUs in the first half of last year, the Mar­itime and Port Au­thor­ity of Sin­ga­pore (MPA) said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>It also said that the build­ing of Tuas Port is be­ing done in four dis­tinct phases for greater flex­i­bil­ity in its de­vel­op­ment time­line. It is sched­uled to be fully com­pleted in the 2040s.</p>
    <p>MPA’s spokesman added that it will con­tinue to re­view the time­line, “tak­ing into ac­count Sin­ga­pore’s needs and the growth in sea trade”.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, Trans­port Min­is­ter Ong Ye Kung, in his National Day ad­dress to his staff, gave no hint of a slow­down in the con­struc­tion of Tuas port.</p>
    <p>There had been ques­tions raised re­cently over the project’s time­line amid the pan­demic, in­clud­ing a let­ter to The Straits Times Fo­rum page which said there could be a need to “re­cal­i­brate the con­struc­tion of this port by per­haps slow­ing it down by a few years or even scal­ing the project down” as Covid-19 re­duces sea trade.</p>
    <p>When ready, Tuas, billed as the next-gen­er­a­tion port, will han­dle up to 65 mil­lion TEUs yearly.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore’s port au­thor­ity, an­tic­i­pat­ing a drop in vol­ume this year, will re­spond nim­bly to cap­ture new op­por­tu­ni­ties in ar­eas like e-com­merce, and in­vest in its com­pet­i­tive ad­van­tage, Mr Ong said.</p>
    <p>While ge­og­ra­phy has played a cru­cial role, the Sin­ga­pore port has thrived also be­cause of the op­por­tu­ni­ties seized along the way. “We built on our dy­namic port and gen­er­ated many other com­ple­men­tary in­dus­tries, in ship­ping, ship fi­nance, marine in­sur­ance, mar­itime le­gal, mar­itime lo­gis­tics,” he said.</p>
    <p>To­day, each main haul ship that ar­rives here typ­i­cally trans­fers its con­tain­ers to 100 other ships, be­fore tak­ing on con­tain­ers from an­other 200 ships.</p>
    <p>“So, each main haul ship call­ing at Sin­ga­pore presents 20,000 con­nec­tions. This is what it means to be an interchang­e of the sea,” he added.</p>
    <p>With land trans­port, it costs a lot to main­tain and op­er­ate it – es­pe­cially the MRT sys­tem – but an at­trac­tive pub­lic trans­port sys­tem brings about “a greener, fairer and bet­ter Sin­ga­pore”, Mr Ong said.</p>
    <p>“We de­vote a lot of re­sources to land trans­port,” he noted. “It also costs a lot to main­tain and op­er­ate the sys­tem, and re­new age­ing op­er­at­ing as­sets.”</p>
    <p>He added: “Fare rev­enue is in­suf­fi­cient to cover these op­er­a­tional ex­penses. The Gov­ern­ment has been spend­ing $2 bil­lion ev­ery year to sub­sidise the run­ning of the pub­lic trans­port sys­tem.”</p>
    <p>But an at­trac­tive pub­lic trans­port sys­tem will help Sin­ga­pore move to­wards a car-lite na­tion, he said.</p>
    <p>Es­pe­cially sig­nif­i­cant is the vast im­prove­ment in train ser­vice re­li­a­bil­ity in re­cent years. Be­fore, 30 per cent of SMRT’s main­te­nance ef­forts were de­voted to pre­ven­tive main­te­nance, and 70 per cent to cor­rec­tive main­te­nance.</p>
    <p>To­day, the ra­tio has flipped, Mr Ong said, adding: “We must con­tinue to place main­te­nance and en­gi­neer­ing as a top pri­or­ity.”</p>
