    <p>HONG KONG • Hong Kong me­dia ty­coon and Bei­jing critic Jimmy Lai ap­peared in court yes­ter­day morn­ing to face a charge un­der the city’s na­tional se­cu­rity law that could put him in jail for life.</p>
    <p>He is ac­cused of col­lud­ing with for­eign coun­tries, calling on over­seas gov­ern­ments to sanc­tion Hong Kong and China in re­sponse to the crack­down on pro-democ­racy ac­tivism in the city.</p>
    <p>Lai, 73, is the most high-pro­file per­son charged un­der the sweep­ing law, which has tar­geted the city’s pro-democ­racy move­ment but brought a sem­blance of calm to the fi­nan­cial hub af­ter months of of­ten vi­o­lent protests.</p>
    <p>The po­lice’s new na­tional se­cu­rity depart­ment charged him on Fri­day with “col­lu­sion with a for­eign coun­try or with ex­ter­nal el­e­ments to en­dan­ger na­tional se­cu­rity” un­der the se­cu­rity law. The of­fence car­ries a penalty of up to life im­pris­on­ment.</p>
    <p>The pros­e­cu­tor told the court that Lai’s of­fence was re­quest­ing, from July 1 to Dec 1, that a for­eign coun­try or in­sti­tu­tion, or­gan­i­sa­tion or in­di­vid­ual out­side main­land China, Hong Kong and Ma­cau “im­pose sanc­tions or block­ade, or en­gage in other hos­tile ac­tiv­i­ties” against Hong Kong and China.</p>
    <p>Lai, calm through­out, said he ac­knowl­edged the charge.</p>
    <p>Chief Mag­is­trate Vic­tor So, one of six mag­is­trates hand­picked by the city’s pro-Bei­jing Chief Ex­ec­u­tive Car­rie Lam to han­dle na­tional se­cu­rity cases, said the pros­e­cu­tion needed time to fur­ther in­ves­ti­gate more than 1,000 mes­sages from Lai’s Twit­ter ac­counts, a num­ber of me­dia in­ter­views he gave, and a num­ber of over­seas vis­its in re­la­tion to calls for US sanc­tions against Hong Kong and China.</p>
    <p>Af­ter the hear­ing, Lai’s sup­port­ers shouted words of en­cour­age­ment, which he re­turned with a heart-shaped hand ges­ture.</p>
    <p>Lai is the owner of Hong Kong’s Ap­ple Daily, a pop­u­lar news­pa­per that is unashamedl­y pro-democ­racy and fiercely crit­i­cal of the au­thor­i­ties.</p>
    <p>The po­lice raided the paper’s head­quar­ters in Au­gust and ar­rested a string of se­nior com­pany fig­ures, in­clud­ing Lai.</p>
    <p>Last week, he was de­nied bail and re­manded in cus­tody un­til next April af­ter be­ing charged with fraud.</p>
    <p>He was set to ap­ply for bail on that charge on Tues­day.</p>
    <p>How­ever, the se­cu­rity law states that no bail should be granted un­less the judge has suf­fi­cient grounds to be­lieve the sus­pect will not con­tinue to en­dan­ger na­tional se­cu­rity.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, Chief Mag­is­trate So de­nied Lai’s bail ap­pli­ca­tion.</p>
    <p>Separately, for­mer Hong Kong law­maker and pro-in­de­pen­dence ac­tivist Six­tus Le­ung said on Fri­day he had left the city and was in the United States to seek asy­lum.</p>
    <p>He is the lat­est in a string of democ­racy ac­tivists and for­mer leg­is­la­tors who have fled Hong Kong since Bei­jing im­posed the na­tional se­cu­rity law in June.</p>
