    <p>Goh Chok Tong tells Li Xuey­ing what the lat­est GE re­sults mean for the country</p>
    <p>Four days after Gen­eral Elec­tion 2020 – and un­en­cum­bered by du­ties and meet­ings for the first time in his adult life – Emer­i­tus Senior Min­is­ter Goh Chok Tong al­lowed him­self a lit­tle chuckle.</p>
    <p>In a Face­book post on July 14, he wrote about a health scare fol­low­ing the dis­cov­ery of a white spot, pos­si­bly ma­lig­nant, on his lar­ynx last year. A biopsy was ruled out as he had a health com­pli­ca­tion. So a pe­riod of ob­ser­va­tion fol­lowed.</p>
    <p>“Saw my doc­tor this morn­ing. Hooray! No more white spot,” ESM Goh an­nounced the good news.</p>
    <p>“But too late to re­verse my de­ci­sion to re­tire as MP.”</p>
    <p>It turns out, Sin­ga­pore’s sec­ond prime min­is­ter was hav­ing a bit of fun. “I was just be­ing cheeky with my­self,” he tells The Sun­day Times. “Some peo­ple read it too lit­er­ally, some peo­ple un­der­stand – they en­joyed it.”</p>
    <p>The 79-year-old had ac­tu­ally set the wheels in mo­tion for his re­tire­ment more than two years ago when he told Prime Min­is­ter Lee Hsien Loong they should plan for it.</p>
    <p>Shortly after, PM Lee sent Dr Tan See Leng, then the chief ex­ec­u­tive of­fi­cer of a health­care group, to un­der­study ESM Goh in his ward in Marine Pa­rade GRC. But “we would not de­cide un­til the last minute, in case I’m re­ally needed to de­fend Marine Pa­rade”.</p>
    <p>On Nom­i­na­tion Day, ESM Goh told his ac­tivists he would not be con­test­ing in the July 10 polls.</p>
    <p>And so, for the first time since 1976, Goh Chok Tong did not ap­pear on a Peo­ple’s Ac­tion Party (PAP) bal­lot paper.</p>
    <p>The tall be­spec­ta­cled man who made his­tory by prov­ing that Sin­ga­pore can sur­vive – and thrive – with­out a Lee Kuan Yew at the helm, has yet again de­parted from the style of his pre­de­ces­sor, who died in 2015 a sit­ting MP of Tan­jong Pagar GRC.</p>
    <p>WALK­ING AWAY, LOOK­ING BACK</p>
    <p>Still, old habits die hard.</p>
    <p>On polling night, he was at the PAP branch at Block 46 Marine Cres­cent – like he was for the past 10 gen­eral elec­tions – along with Dr Tan and polling agents as the re­sults rolled in.</p>
    <p>“I wanted just to be with them,” he says. “To en­cour­age them.”</p>
    <p>The man he suc­ceeded had fa­mously said he would “get up” even at the point of dy­ing, if he felt something was going wrong in Sin­ga­pore. ESM Goh has no such idea.</p>
    <p>In­stead, he quips: “I don’t be­lieve that I should leave hor­i­zon­tal, be­ing car­ried out feet first.”</p>
    <p>How does this for­mer Sin­ga­pore prime min­is­ter in­tend to walk away then?</p>
    <p>De­lib­er­ately and stead­fastly, though per­haps not with­out some look­ing back over his shoul­der.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing the 11/ 2- hour in­ter­view last Mon­day at the Is­tana, where he re­tains an of­fice, ESM Goh re­flected on some key mo­ments in his 44 years as an MP (1976-2020) and 14 years as prime min­is­ter (1990-2004).</p>
    <p>But with the heft of an el­der, he also of­fers his un­flinch­ing take on to­day’s Sin­ga­pore, even as he waves away some ques­tions, cit­ing the need to be sen­si­tive to its lead­ers.</p>
    <p>The big­gest change to his life so far is “the abil­ity to slow time”.</p>
    <p>He says: “Life before this was gov­erned by sched­ules and meet­ings. And those very of­ten were not un­der your con­trol.”</p>
    <p>Still, his cal­en­dar is fill­ing up. He has sounded out PM Lee on con­duct­ing fire­side chats with new MPs. Top­ics could range from the role of an MP to geopol­i­tics. PM Lee has given the green light.</p>
    <p>He will also re­tain his ESM ti­tle and make him­self avail­able for the fur­ther­ing of ties with In­dia and Myan­mar, with which he main­tains spe­cial links. Since 2011, when he stepped down from the Cab­i­net, he has re­ceived no salary for this.</p>
    <p>He has also been ap­pointed Senior Ad­viser to the Peo­ple’s As­so­ci­a­tion (PA), another un­paid role. He hopes to nudge it into pay­ing more at­ten­tion to vul­ner­a­ble res­i­dents. He is also mulling over if it could step up as a one-stop in­for­ma­tion centre for all poli­cies and schemes.</p>
    <p>“Peo­ple say, ‘You know, the Gov­ern­ment plans poli­cies, how come you never tell me all this?’ They are all out there but the res­i­dents some­how do not have one place that they can go to for the in­for­ma­tion.”</p>
    <p>AN IN­FLEX­ION POINT</p>
    <p>The con­ver­sa­tion in­evitably veers to the just-con­cluded elec­tion and what it means for Sin­ga­pore and the PAP.</p>
    <p>Even for the man who fought 10 gen­eral elec­tions and one by-elec­tion, the GE 2020 re­sults came as a sur­prise. The Work­ers’ Party (WP) won an un­prece­dented two GRCs and one SMC. The PAP gar­nered 61.2 per cent of the votes.</p>
    <p>“To be very frank, I was ex­pect­ing a bet­ter per­for­mance for the rul­ing party be­cause of the Covid sit­u­a­tion. I do be­lieve that peo­ple gen­er­ally will take flight to safety.”</p>
    <p>Look­ing back, there was a mis­match in what the PAP cam­paigned on, and what the peo­ple, es­pe­cially younger ones, want, he says.</p>
    <p>“I don’t think the party was ad­dress­ing the as­pi­ra­tion side of what the young wanted, be­cause they started to mes­sage on Covid-19 chal­lenges and so on. But the young felt it’s your job, you can han­dle it; but what about my as­pi­ra­tions?”</p>
    <p>Key among these is a de­sire for more voices.</p>
    <p>ESM Goh re­counts meet­ing a young woman in Marine Pa­rade who told him di­ver­sity was the one thing she wants.</p>
    <p>Well, what does di­ver­sity mean, he asked her in turn. “So she said, your Marine Pa­rade team – there is no woman.”</p>
    <p>Be­yond gen­der, there is a crav­ing for a broader rep­re­sen­ta­tion of voices, he says. The PAP had started mov­ing in this di­rec­tion in re­cent gen­eral elec­tions, bring­ing in non­estab­lish­ment can­di­dates such as an­i­mal ac­tivist Louis Ng, he says.</p>
    <p>But ESM Goh ac­knowl­edges that even such voices ul­ti­mately have to toe the party line.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, the WP is com­ing across as an in­ter­est­ing al­ter­na­tive, “a fresh party with fresh faces”.</p>
    <p>“We’re at an in­flex­ion point in terms of po­lit­i­cal mood and expectatio­n,” he says. It is nat­u­ral that the elec­torate would want to “try the other side” if it looks at­trac­tive enough.</p>
    <p>What has sur­prised him is the speed at which Sin­ga­pore has reached this point.</p>
    <p>“I was ex­pect­ing this change, but not now. I was an­tic­i­pat­ing it maybe in 2025, when the 4G takes over and there’s a change in lead­er­ship. If not, the one after that.”</p>
    <p>2G ON 4G</p>
    <p>GE 2020 was widely seen as a com­ing-out party of sorts for the 4G, led by Deputy Prime Min­is­ter Heng Swee Keat. It was the first elec­toral bat­tle since they were cat­a­pulted into key PAP po­si­tions; Mr Heng and Mr Chan Chun Sing stepped up as the two as­sis­tant sec­re­tary-gen­er­als in Novem­ber 2018.</p>
    <p>On whether the ear­lier-than-ex­pected ar­rival of the “in­flex­ion point” is a re­flec­tion of pub­lic con­fi­dence in the 4G, ESM Goh says: “I think the 4G has not yet shown them­selves po­lit­i­cally. They are in­tel­li­gent, very com­pe­tent, hard­work­ing and good in run­ning min­istries. To be fair to them, they have not quite yet shown that po­lit­i­cal acu­men, po­lit­i­cal lead­er­ship.”</p>
    <p>In search­ing for tal­ent, the PAP looks for peo­ple who can gov­ern best, he says.</p>
    <p>“In many other coun­tries, peo­ple come in be­cause they’re politi­cians. They know how to play around with the mood, how to get votes (but) in gov­ern­ing they are weaker.</p>
    <p>“We are try­ing to get good peo­ple who know about gov­ern­ing, who know the sub­ject mat­ter and make them be­come po­lit­i­cal lead­ers.”</p>
    <p>Mr Heng was orig­i­nally ex­pected to take over in two years, when PM Lee turns 70. But PM Lee has now said the pan­demic may change the time­line, as he wants to hand Sin­ga­pore over in good shape.</p>
    <p>ESM Goh knows what it feels like to be un­der scru­tiny as a politi­cian.</p>
    <p>He jokes that he him­self was “slightly bet­ter than a lamp post” when he en­tered pol­i­tics, in the book Tall Or­der writ­ten by for­mer Straits Times jour­nal­ist Peh Shing Huei.</p>
    <p>The seed of self-doubt did not go away even after 12 years in pol­i­tics. In 1988, the same year that many ex­pected him to take over as PM, his men­tor dropped a bomb­shell.</p>
    <p>Goh Chok Tong, said Mr Lee Kuan Yew, was not his first choice to be his suc­ces­sor. He went on to de­scribe his des­ig­nated suc­ces­sor as “wooden”.</p>
    <p>The pub­lic cri­tique floored ESM Goh then, but he mar­shalled his em­bar­rass­ment into im­prov­ing his com­mu­ni­ca­tion skills, even­tu­ally be­com­ing one of Sin­ga­pore’s most pop­u­lar po­lit­i­cal lead­ers.</p>
    <p>To­day, with Mr Heng fac­ing the same in­tense scru­tiny, he feels a mea­sure of com­rade­ship with the younger man.</p>
    <p>Says ESM Goh: “Let him try his best. Maybe if I talk to him, I can just give him some tips here and there, the way Lee Kuan Yew gave me some tips.”</p>
    <p>And what might those tips be? He laughs. “No, no, no, these are se­cret recipes.”</p>
    <p>STABILISER­S FOR SIN­GA­PORE</p>
    <p>If ESM Goh has his way, the cur­rent balance be­tween the PAP and the op­po­si­tion par­ties in Par­lia­ment will stay as it is.</p>
    <p>“If we can sta­bilise there, I think it’s big enough of a pres­ence to put some pres­sure on the Gov­ern­ment.”</p>
    <p>But hav­ing been round the block, he knows that there is no sure thing in pol­i­tics. Which is why he likes to talk about the im­por­tance of “stabiliser­s”, many of which he in­tro­duced, from the GRC sys­tem to get­ting MPs to run town coun­cils.</p>
    <p>ESM Goh in­sists these are not aimed pri­mar­ily at dis­ad­van­tag­ing the op­po­si­tion but to pre­vent dis­rup­tions to ser­vice. Also, any op­po­si­tion party that does take over will be bet­ter prepared for the job.</p>
    <p>JOB WELL DONE</p>
    <p>GOING FOR THE JUGULAR</p>
    <p>The com­bat­ive Mr Lee made no bones about his be­lief that it was bet­ter for a po­lit­i­cal leader to be feared than liked. ESM Goh pre­ferred to em­pha­sise a will­ing­ness to lis­ten to the peo­ple, and to lead through ca­jol­ing and per­suad­ing.</p>
    <p>In 1988, Mr Lee ac­cused him of not even hav­ing the guts to cut pesky jour­nal­ists off when the stream of ques­tions did not cease.</p>
    <p>ESM Goh had also told his speech coach Sue Green­wood his style of gov­er­nance is: “I don’t want to hurt peo­ple.”</p>
    <p>Yet, he has been ruth­less when he felt the need for it.</p>
    <p>“Some peo­ple don’t like it but in pol­i­tics there are times when you’ve got to go for the jugular, be­cause down the road that per­son could be­come more trou­ble­some for you once he gets a foothold.</p>
    <p>“When it came to is­sues of race or re­li­gion, you don’t al­low some­body to put their nose into the tent. So on cer­tain ba­sic is­sues you’ve got to come down very hard. If you’re not prepared to do it, you can’t gov­ern.”</p>
    <p>I DID MY JOB</p>
    <p>Look­ing back, he says Aug 12, 2004 will be the one achieve­ment he will tell his grand­chil­dren about.</p>
    <p>“My proud­est mo­ment was when Lee Hsien Loong was sworn in as prime min­is­ter be­cause that was the end of my jour­ney.</p>
    <p>“I kept Sin­ga­pore going and I handed Sin­ga­pore in very good shape, pris­tine state to him, with very beau­ti­ful elec­tion re­sults. So, a lot of sat­is­fac­tion.</p>
    <p>“I didn’t tell any­body, but in­side: I’ve done my job.”</p>
