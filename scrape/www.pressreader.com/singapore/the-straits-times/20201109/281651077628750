    <p>• Coro­n­avirus trans­mis­sion from minks to hu­mans does not nec­es­sar­ily mean the dis­ease will be­come more dan­ger­ous, but sci­en­tists are on their guard after last week’s as­tound­ing an­nounce­ment from Den­mark.</p>
    <p>Dan­ish Prime Min­is­ter Mette Fred­erik­sen said last Wed­nes­day that the coun­try will kill more than 15 mil­lion minks, and that a vari­ant of the Sars-CoV-2 virus that had been trans­mit­ted from the an­i­mals to 12 peo­ple could im­pact a vac­cine’s ef­fec­tive­ness.</p>
    <p>Global me­dia re­acted with shock, es­pe­cially given the high level of fear al­ready caused by the Covid-19 epi­demic that has claimed more than 1.2 mil­lion lives in less than a year.</p>
    <p>Spe­cial­ists are not con­vinced the dan­ger is much greater and are wait­ing for more ev­i­dence.</p>
    <p>“I re­ally wish that the trend of sci­ence by press re­lease would stop,” com­mented Dr An­gela Ras­mussen, a vi­rol­o­gist at Columbia University in New York.</p>
    <p>“There’s no rea­son why the ge­nomic data couldn’t be shared, which would al­low the sci­en­tific com­mu­nity to eval­u­ate these claims,” she added on Twit­ter.</p>
    <p>Viruses such as the one that emerged in China late last year mu­tate con­stantly and new vari­ants are not nec­es­sar­ily worse than the pre­vi­ous ones.</p>
    <p>So far, no study has shown newer Sars-CoV-2 vari­ants to be more con­ta­gious or dan­ger­ous than their pre­de­ces­sors.</p>
    <p>The con­tam­i­na­tion of minks is not new ei­ther, with breed­ers in sev­eral coun­tries, in­clud­ing the Nether­lands, Spain, Swe­den and the United States, re­port­ing cases.</p>
    <p>A few cases of hu­mans be­ing in­fected by minks have also been re­ported.</p>
    <p>Den­mark has been spe­cific in de­scrib­ing how the dif­fer­ent strain of the virus jumped from mink to man.</p>
    <p>“Ac­cord­ing to the in­for­ma­tion from Dan­ish au­thor­i­ties, this virus is nei­ther more path­o­genic nor more vir­u­lent,” spe­cial­ist Gilles Sal­vat of French health agency Anses told Agence France-Presse.</p>
    <p>There is con­cern, how­ever, that a vari­ant “emerges like a sec­ond</p>
    <p>EX­CES­SIVE CLAIM</p>
    <p>virus and dom­i­nates the pop­u­la­tion”, he noted.</p>
    <p>“Com­ing up with a vac­cine for one strain is al­ready com­pli­cated, and if we have to do it for two, four or six strains, it is even more com­pli­cated.”</p>
    <p>He con­sid­ered the de­ci­sion to cull Dan­ish minks a “pre­cau­tion”.</p>
    <p>Pro­fes­sor Fran­cois Bal­loux, who teaches at University Col­lege London, agreed, telling AFP: “This mea­sure is en­tirely jus­ti­fi­able from a health per­spec­tive to elim­i­nate the trans­mis­sion source of a se­ri­ous virus.”</p>
    <p>He nonethe­less also felt that “evok­ing the risk that mink could gen­er­ate a sec­ond pan­demic seems ex­ces­sive and coun­ter­pro­duc­tive in the cur­rent fear­ful cli­mate”.</p>
    <p>Prof Bal­loux noted that sim­i­lar mu­ta­tions ex­ist within the pop­u­la­tion al­ready and have not spread.</p>
    <p>“We know this virus with the same mu­ta­tions emerged on mink farms, was trans­mit­ted to hu­mans and did not spread widely,” he said.</p>
    <p>All the same, it was not “com­pletely im­pos­si­ble” that the new strain “could spread and ren­der vac­cines less ef­fec­tive”, the pro­fes­sor ac­knowl­edged.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, “the true im­pli­ca­tions of the changes in the spike pro­tein have not yet been eval­u­ated by the in­ter­na­tional sci­en­tific com­mu­nity and are thus un­clear”, re­marked Dr James Wood, head of ve­teri­nary medicine at the University of Cam­bridge.</p>
    <p>“It is too early to say that the change will cause ei­ther vac­cines or im­mu­nity to fail,” he told the Sci­ence Me­dia Cen­tre.</p>
    <p>Cases have also been noted of con­tam­i­na­tion by the Covid-19 virus from cats, dogs and even lions and tigers at the New York zoo.</p>
    <p>But at this point, “the risk of an­i­mals spread­ing Covid-19 to peo­ple is con­sid­ered to be low”, ac­cord­ing to the US Cen­tres for Dis­ease Con­trol and Preven­tion.</p>
    <p>Dogs and cats are dead ends from an epi­demi­ol­o­gist’s point of view, Anses’ Mr Sal­vat ex­plained, be­cause “they can pro­vi­sion­ally host the virus, but can­not mul­ti­ply it enough to be con­ta­gious”.</p>
    <p>The French au­thor­i­ties have nonethe­less urged Covid-19 pa­tients to “avoid all con­tact” with their pets, es­pe­cially fer­rets, which be­long to the same fam­ily as minks.</p>
    <p>Dr Ras­mussen ex­pressed con­cern about the chances of the coro­n­avirus be­ing spread by wild cats.</p>
    <p>“Cats are sus­cep­ti­ble to in­fec­tion and there are mil­lions of feral cats in the US (and mil­lions more glob­ally). If cats be­come an es­tab­lished reser­voir, we may be stuck with Sars-CoV-2 for years to come,” she warned.</p>
    <p>Evok­ing the risk that mink could gen­er­ate a sec­ond pan­demic seems ex­ces­sive and coun­ter­pro­duc­tive in the cur­rent fear­ful cli­mate.</p>
