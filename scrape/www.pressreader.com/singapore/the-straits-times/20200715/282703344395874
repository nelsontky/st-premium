    <p>Aries (March 21 - April 19)</p>
    <p>Keep your com­mu­ni­ca­tions short. It is too easy to get wrapped up in your mes­sage and find your­self go­ing on and on.</p>
    <p>Tau­rus (April 20 - May 20)</p>
    <p>Speak out on your true feel­ings. It may seem dif­fi­cult at first, but you are sure to get to some­where good by the time it is all over.</p>
    <p>Gem­ini (May 21 - June 20)</p>
    <p>Flow through the day with­out think­ing too hard about where you are or what you are do­ing. Things are great if you let life go on.</p>
    <p>Can­cer (June 21 - July 22)</p>
    <p>You are find­ing it hard to han­dle your work. Call in re­in­force­ments if you can or slink off early if you can­not.</p>
    <p>Leo (July 23 - Aug 22)</p>
    <p>Your en­ergy is pos­i­tive and light-hearted, so you are like­lier to see the up­side of al­most ev­ery­thing.</p>
    <p>Virgo (Aug 23 - Sept 22)</p>
    <p>Your mind is even faster than usual, so you should be able to get more out of your in­ter­ac­tions with peo­ple.</p>
    <p>Li­bra (Sept 23 - Oct 22)</p>
    <p>You see both sides of ev­ery­thing. This helps you to keep life in bal­ance and it also means your en­ergy is bet­ter spread around your projects.</p>
    <p>Scor­pio (Oct 23 - Nov 21)</p>
    <p>Try to be more care­ful. Things are not adding up, but you are not go­ing to see what is re­ally hap­pen­ing un­til it is time to act.</p>
    <p>Sagit­tar­ius (Nov 22 - Dec 21)</p>
    <p>You are think­ing hard, but you may not be able to fig­ure out what you are get­ting at. Keep at it and the sit­u­a­tion will be clearer soon.</p>
    <p>Capri­corn (Dec 22 - Jan 19) Pare back your needs to the bare min­i­mum or things are likely to spin out of con­trol rather quickly.</p>
    <p>Aquar­ius (Jan 20 - Feb 18) Your in­tel­lect is help­ing you to meet new peo­ple and you may make a great im­pres­sion on one of them in par­tic­u­lar.</p>
    <p>Pisces (Feb 19 - March 20)</p>
    <p>You are feel­ing a burst of cre­ative en­ergy, so make the most of it. Cre­ate art or show that one hot­tie how spe­cial life is with you.</p>
