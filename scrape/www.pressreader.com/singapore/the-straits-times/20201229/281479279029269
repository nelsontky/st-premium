    </section>

    <p>As one would ex­pect from a place whose name has roots in an abo­rig­i­nal phrase that means “end of the earth”, there is vast empti­ness on the rugged Shire­toko Penin­sula on the north-east­ern tip of Hokkaido.</p>
    <p>It is here that I meet Mrs Et­suko Umezawa, 76, an eth­nic Ainu whose di­alect had in­spired the des­ti­na­tion’s name (“sir etok”).</p>
    <p>I had wan­dered into her shop, my cu­rios­ity piqued by the or­nate em­broi­dery and hand-carved or­na­ments with unusual pat­terns that look noth­ing like typ­i­cal Ja­panese sou­venirs.</p>
    <p>She beams with pride when I ask her about this, say­ing that it is a cen­turies-old tra­di­tion. She of­fers a warm cup of bit­ter herbal tea – “Good for the in­testines, es­pe­cially ef­fec­tive after a heavy meal or a night of heavy drink­ing,” she says – as an in­tro­duc­tion to the Ainu cul­ture.</p>
    <p>“The Ainu have a rich re­spect for the en­vi­ron­ment and live in har­mony with the land.”</p>
    <p>With her hus­band Masao, she runs the Shu­chou-no-ie (House Of An Ainu Chief, 124 Utoro­hi­gashi, Shari, Hokkaido; +81-152-24-2742; hpdsp.jp/shu­chonoie). This is also a mod­est ryokan with a hot spring, an eatery fea­tur­ing Ainu cui­sine and an Ainu cloth­ing ren­tal shop.</p>
    <p>The Ainu abo­rig­i­nal group, na­tive to Hokkaido, have suf­fered from op­pres­sion and even de­nial of their eth­nic­ity for cen­turies. It was only last year that the Ja­panese gov­ern­ment of­fi­cially recog­nised their in­dige­nous sta­tus.</p>
    <p>The Umeza­was have made it their mis­sion to raise aware­ness of their long-hid­den her­itage among vis­i­tors to the Shire­toko Penin­sula, which is it­self un­der the radar given its in­ac­ces­si­bil­ity.</p>
    <p>This is de­spite the Shire­toko’s clear claim to fame, as a Unesco World Her­itage Site.</p>
    <p>In­flu­ences of the Ainu are, like­wise, hid­den in plain sight in Ja­pan: the di­alect in­spired the names of more pop­u­lar tourist des­ti­na­tions such as Sap­poro (“im­por­tant river flow­ing through a plain”) and Niseko (“stand­ing cliff”).</p>
    <p>Be­ing at the Shire­toko Penin­sula</p>
    <p>means be­ing one with na­ture and the el­e­ments, Mrs Umezawa says, not­ing that the penin­sula changes by the sea­son.</p>
    <p>I vis­ited in Oc­to­ber, in early au­tumn, as leaves of the lush forests were start­ing to turn into mag­nif­i­cent hues of red and brown. The area will now be blan­keted in snow.</p>
    <p>The pris­tine, primeval na­ture is marked by the Shire­toko moun­tain range – in­clud­ing the 1,547m-tall Mount Shari, which is among Ja­pan’s 100 fa­mous mountains – as well as the crys­tal-clear wa­ters of the Sea of Okhotsk, which is Ja­pan’s main source of salmon.</p>
    <p>The Shire­toko Penin­sula is the main at­trac­tion of Okhotsk, one of nine sub-pre­fec­tures in Hokkaido, while the cities of Ki­tami and Abashiri are steeped in his­tory.</p>
    <p>Many locals tell me that Fe­bru­ary is the most mag­i­cal time to visit, given the phe­nom­e­non of “drift ice” with the Sea of Okhotsk cov­ered in ice floes.</p>
    <p>This was one of the win­ning fac­tors be­hind the Unesco her­itage recog­ni­tion.</p>
    <p>AD­VEN­TURES IN THE WILD</p>
    <p>While in­ter­na­tional travel is un­likely to re­sume soon enough to wit­ness the up­com­ing oc­cur­rence, tourists can look for­ward to out­doorsy es­capes in the wilder­ness no mat­ter when the visit is timed.</p>
    <p>Em­bark on a dig­i­tal detox jour­ney after months of tele­work and Zoom meet­ings – data con­nec­tion is patchy given the re­mote­ness.</p>
    <p>Ac­tiv­i­ties at the Shire­toko Penin­sula, which at 386.33 sq km is about half the size of Sin­ga­pore, vary by sea­son. Camp un­der the stars or go kayak­ing in the warmer months – and snow-trek in win­ter.</p>
    <p>There are ac­tive vol­ca­noes, pre­cip­i­tous cliffs and lush forests that form one of the world’s dens­est habi­tats of brown bears. And they are rel­a­tively easy to spot: I saw two from afar, fish­ing and frol­ick­ing in wa­ters off the coast.</p>
    <p>They give the face to Shire­toko’s mas­cot Doco, a cute but clumsy bear en­gag­ing in ac­tiv­i­ties like hik­ing and soak­ing in an onsen.</p>
    <p>There are also free-roam­ing deer and sea­sonal mi­gra­tory birds, as well as whales, dol­phins and seals.</p>
    <p>Start your ad­ven­ture at the Shire­toko Na­tional Park Na­ture Cen­tre (531 On­nebet­sumura, Shari; +81152-24-2114; open 8am to 5.30pm from April 20 to Oct 20 and 9am to 4pm from Oct 21 to April 19; free, with some paid ac­tiv­i­ties; cen­ter. shire­toko.or.jp), a gen­tri­fied site with oc­ca­sional ac­tiv­i­ties such as yoga and movie nights, and the Sap­poro-based cafe Baris­tart Cof­fee.</p>
    <p>Check in with park rangers for ad­vice on your ex­pe­di­tion, or at­tend a free lec­ture on the re­gion’s wildlife.</p>
    <p>There is equip­ment for rent, such as binoc­u­lars and trekking poles, if you find your­self un­der­pre­pared. Or, pick up some re­gionex­clu­sive prod­ucts at The North Face and Helly Hansen store be­fore go­ing on one of the sev­eral hik­ing trails that be­gin and end at the na­ture cen­tre.</p>
    <p>I took the Frepe Wa­ter­fall Trail, a 2km path that leads to a stun­ning view of a pre­cip­i­tous cliff. This “wa­ter­fall” does not stem from a river, but from ground­wa­ter that flows out of a crack in the cliff. The trickle gives it its nick­name Otome no Namida (Vir­gin’s Tears).</p>
    <p>An­other must-visit is the Shire­toko Goko Lakes (On­nebet­sumura, Shari; +81-152-24-3323; open­ing hours vary, closed for win­ter from Nov 9 to April 19; str.sg/JRB8), which look es­pe­cially ma­jes­tic with the Shire­toko mountains form­ing the back­ground.</p>
    <p>The eas­i­est route, via the el­e­vated board­walk, cov­ers just one of the five lakes.</p>
    <p>The more ad­ven­tur­ous may want to hire a paid guide (var­i­ous op­tions, in­clud­ing a 5,000 yen or S$64 course that takes three hours) to get closer to na­ture. Call ahead, as trails may be closed in the event of bad weather or a bear sight­ing.</p>
    <p>For a greater adren­a­line rush, book a down­hill cy­cling tour at Shire­toko Cy­cling (96 Utoro­hi­gashi, Shari; +81-152-24-2380; www.shire­toko­cy­cling.com/en; open­ing hours vary by sea­son and weather; mul­ti­ple op­tions avail­able). The 15km down­hill ride, en­veloped by na­ture, starts from a 740m-tall view­point on the Shire­toko Pass.</p>
    <p>Con­tinue your ad­ven­ture in the nearby city of Abashiri with Con­nec­trip (812-2 Yo­bito, Abashiri; +81-50-1099-3708; con­nec­tripokhots­k.com). The firm or­gan­ises di­verse ac­tiv­i­ties in­clud­ing kayak­ing on Lake Abashiri in au­tumn and snow­shoe tours in win­ter, along with less sporty op­tions like star-gaz­ing tours and fruit-pick­ing ex­pe­di­tions.</p>
    <p>GET UP CLOSE AND PER­SONAL</p>
    <p>If you do not man­age to spot any an­i­mals in the wild, you can also see them in cap­tiv­ity.</p>
    <p>Gush over how cute the foxes are at the Hokkaido Fox Vil­lage (52-1 Rubeshibec­ho Hanaoka, Ki­tami; +81-157-45-2249; open 9am to 4pm; ad­mis­sion: 500 yen; ki­tak­it­sune­farm.com), one of only two kit­sune or fox vil­lages in Ja­pan. It is home to about 50 foxes, the pride and joy of direc­tor Kashio Tokikazu.</p>
    <p>Or go to the nearby North­ern Daichi Aquar­ium (1-4 Rubeshibec­ho Mat­suyama, Ki­tami; +81-157-45-2223; open 8.30am to 5pm from April to Oc­to­ber, 9am to 4.30pm from Novem­ber to March; closed April 8 to 14, Dec 26 to Jan 1; ad­mis­sion: 670 yen; www.on­neyuaq.com). Its zeal­ous direc­tor Sou Ya­mauchi, 33, counts him­self lucky for achiev­ing his child­hood dream job of run­ning an aquar­ium.</p>
    <p>There are 50 species of fish, in­clud­ing the en­dan­gered na­tive gi­ant fresh­wa­ter fish itou (Ja­panese huchen) that can grow up to 2m long.</p>
    <p>Just out­side the aquar­ium is the world’s largest cuckoo clock that stands tall at 19.8m, with birds and for­est fairies com­ing out in a fiveminute “per­for­mance” on the hour be­tween 8am and 6pm.</p>
    <p>The build­ing, known as the Ka­murin Tower, show­cases lo­cal crafts­man­ship with tim­ber and con­tains a mini-ar­cade with game ma­chines made en­tirely of wood.</p>
    <p>FOR HIS­TORY BUFFS</p>
    <p>His­tory geeks can sa­ti­ate their ap­petite for knowl­edge at mu­se­ums like the Ki­tami Mint Me­mo­rial Mu­seum (1-7-28 Mi­nam­i­naka­machi, Ki­tami; +81-157-23-6200; open 9am to 5pm from May to Oc­to­ber and 9.30am to 4.30pm from Novem­ber to April, closed on Mon­days and the day after pub­lic hol­i­days; free with paid ac­tiv­i­ties; www.ki­ta­mi­hakka.jp).</p>
    <p>It pays trib­ute to the city’s role in once be­ing the world’s largest ex­porter of mint, ac­count­ing for 70 per cent of the global market un­til just after World War II.</p>
    <p>The Abashiri Pri­son Mu­seum (1-1 Yo­bito, Abashiri; +81-152-45-2411; open 9am to 5pm ex­cept Aug 1 to 16, when it is open un­til 6pm; ad­mis­sion: 1,100 yen; str.sg/JRB6) was once one of Hokkaido’s old­est jail­houses. It opened in 1890 and once housed Ja­pan’s most hard­ened crim­i­nals.</p>
    <p>I was in­trigued by the story of anti-hero Yoshie Shi­ra­tori (1907-1979), whose claim to fame was hav­ing bro­ken out of jail four times. The jail­breaker was im­pris­oned in Abashiri from April 1943 un­til his es­cape from the max­i­mum se­cu­rity pri­son in Au­gust 1944.</p>
    <p>En­ter the pri­son cells to feel the claus­tro­pho­bia, then have lunch at the next-door Jail­house Cafe­te­ria (11am to 3.30pm daily).</p>
    <p>On the menu is food that is al­most iden­ti­cal to what in­mates eat at the cur­rent Abashiri Pri­son. While a nov­elty ex­pe­ri­ence, the food, which in­cludes rice mixed with bar­ley, is (per­haps rightly) noth­ing to shout about.</p>
    <p>WIN­TER WON­DER­LAND</p>
    <p>Locals take the cold very se­ri­ously, and bat­tle it out in en­durance chal­lenges that will be­wil­der any­one from a more trop­i­cal climate.</p>
    <p>If you think you have what it takes, sign up for the yakiniku (grilled meat) fes­ti­val that Ki­tami holds out­doors in Fe­bru­ary, when the mer­cury falls be­low mi­nus 10 deg C. Locals claim that heat from the burn­ing grills and a healthy con­sump­tion of beer are more than enough to warm them up.</p>
    <p>The main high­light in that month is the “drift ice” phe­nom­e­non that has also in­spired the­matic food such as blue beer and blue curry that taste much bet­ter than they sound.</p>
    <p>One of the best places to view the drift ice is at Cape No­toro (Misaki, Abashiri), fa­mous for its dis­tinc­tive black-and-white light­house.</p>
    <p>Even if you visit off-sea­son, ex­pe­ri­ence how win­ter feels like at the Okhotsk Ryuhyo Drift Ice Mu­seum (244-3 Ten­tozan, Abashiri;+81152-43-5951; open 8.30am to 6pm from May to Oc­to­ber and 9am to 4.30pm from Novem­ber to April; ad­mis­sion 750 yen; www.ryuhyokan.com/guide/en).</p>
    <p>Rent a down jacket and en­ter a room at around mi­nus 15 deg C, where real drift ice har­vested from the sea in the pre­vi­ous sea­son is on dis­play.</p>
    <p>See the drift ice up-close through pro­jec­tion map­ping, and sea­sonal aquatic crea­tures like the mys­ti­cal clione, a sea slug with a translu­cent body that eats by split­ting its head into two and stretch­ing its six hid­den ten­ta­cles to catch food.</p>
    <p>These are among the primeval se­crets that the re­mote Shire­toko Penin­sula has kept hid­den for far too long, and I know I will be back for more.</p>
