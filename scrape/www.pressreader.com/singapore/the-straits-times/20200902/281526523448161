    <p>Work­ers in the aero­space sec­tor can now tap a $14 mil­lion sup­port pack­age that will of­fer them more train­ing cour­ses with higher rates of sub­si­dies.</p>
    <p>The mea­sure comes un­der the ex­ten­sion of the En­hanced Train­ing Sup­port Pack­age, which was ini­tially avail­able to six other sec­tors that have been hard hit by the Covid-19 pan­demic.</p>
    <p>To date, more than 35,000 em­ploy­ees in the other sec­tors, in­clud­ing tourism and re­tail, have ben­e­fited from the pack­age.</p>
    <p>Ail­ing cruise op­er­a­tor Gent­ing Hong Kong has sold the Zouk Group, which op­er­ates the pop­u­lar night­club, for $14 mil­lion as part of ef­forts to off­load non-core as­sets and gen­er­ate liq­uid­ity for the cash­strapped firm.</p>
    <p>Malaysian firm Tulipa is buy­ing the Sin­ga­pore-based group, ac­cord­ing to a fil­ing on the Hong Kong Ex­change last night.</p>
    <p>Tulipa is owned by Mr Lim Keong Hui, the son of Gent­ing Hong Kong’s con­trol­ling share­holder.</p>
    <p>Mr Lim re­signed from the Gent­ing</p>
    <p>Hong Kong board last week.</p>
    <p>The cash sale is ex­pected to re­sult in a gain of about HK$6.7 mil­lion (S$1.2 mil­lion), which will be used as work­ing cap­i­tal, the fil­ing said.</p>
    <p>Con­cerns were raised over Gent­ing Hong Kong’s fi­nances last month af­ter it dis­closed that it had sus­pended all pay­ments to cred­i­tors. The firm said then that cash flow had been im­pacted by the pan­demic and funds would have to be chan­nelled to ser­vices crit­i­cal to the com­pany’s op­er­a­tions.</p>
    <p>Gent­ing Hong Kong owns the Star, Dream and Crys­tal Cruises brands, op­er­ates ship­yards and has a stake in Re­sorts World Manila.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day’s fil­ing said sell­ing the Zouk Group is part of ef­forts to con­serve cash and seek ad­di­tional sources of fi­nance to sus­tain the busi­ness, pend­ing the re­sump­tion of cruise op­er­a­tions.</p>
    <p>Home-grown night­club Zouk, ranked among the top clubs in the world, was sold to Gent­ing Hong Kong in 2015. The Zouk Group’s other as­sets in­clude the Five Guys burger joint at Plaza Sin­ga­pura.</p>
    <p>The group made a pre-tax loss of HK$79.6 mil­lion for the seven months to July 31 and had an unau­dited con­sol­i­dated net as­set value of about HK$72.6 mil­lion as at the same date, it said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>While the to­tal con­sid­er­a­tion for the sale shares is val­ued at $14 mil­lion, the fi­nal amount is sub­ject to ad­just­ment based on Zouk’s cash level. Af­ter the trans­ac­tion is com­plete, Zouk Group will cease to be an in­di­rect wholly owned sub­sidiary of Gent­ing Hong Kong.</p>
    <p>Gent­ing Hong Kong last Fri­day re­ported a US$742.6m (S$1 bil­lion) net loss for the first half of the year, due in large part to port clo­sures that have forced cruise lines world­wide to sus­pend sail­ings from as early as Fe­bru­ary.</p>
    <p>Rev­enue for the six months was US$226.2 mil­lion, down from US$729.2 mil­lion in the same pe­riod last year. The Hong Kong-listed firm owed US$3.4 bil­lion as at July 31.</p>
    <p>It is im­ple­ment­ing a se­ries of mea­sures that will give it a “rea­son­able prospect” of meet­ing its fi­nan­cial obli­ga­tions un­til June next year, it said last Fri­day.</p>
    <p>These in­clude cost-cut­ting, scal­ing back cap­i­tal ex­pen­di­ture, de­fer­ring loans, un­der­go­ing re­struc­tur­ing and seek­ing ad­di­tional eq­uity or debt fund­ing from pri­vate in­vestors.</p>
    <p>It said it has al­ready re­ceived in­ter­est for in­vest­ment in one of its cruise brands.</p>
    <p>Bloomberg re­ported last month that Malaysian ty­coon Lim Kok Thay, chair­man of the Gent­ing group, pledged al­most his en­tire stake in Gent­ing Hong Kong as col­lat­eral for loans af­ter the firm sus­pended pay­ments to cred­i­tors.</p>
    <p>Malaysian con­glom­er­ate Gent­ing’s hos­pi­tal­ity and gam­ing em­pire has been badly af­fected by pan­demic-re­lated re­stric­tions, which have forced the tem­po­rary clo­sure of casi­nos and put a pause on tourism world­wide.</p>
    <p>Re­sorts World Sen­tosa, op­er­ated by Gent­ing Sin­ga­pore, laid off about 2,000 em­ploy­ees in July af­ter the in­te­grated re­sort was shut for nearly three months.</p>
