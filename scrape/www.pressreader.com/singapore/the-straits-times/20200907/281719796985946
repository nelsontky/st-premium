    <p>The big­gest ca­su­alty of the coron­avirus pan­demic is the job mar­ket. Around the world, tens of mil­lions of peo­ple have lost their liveli­hoods this year.</p>
    <p>In Sin­ga­pore, by some es­ti­mates, up to 150,000 Sin­ga­pore­ans and per­ma­nent res­i­dents could be out of a job by the first half of next year if the econ­omy con­tin­ues to shrink at about 5 per cent on a quar­terly ba­sis.</p>
    <p>Thou­sands of work­ers from var­i­ous sec­tors have ei­ther suf­fered pay cuts or been forced to go on no-pay leave, or have been laid off al­to­gether. As the cri­sis rolls on, the num­bers will keep ris­ing.</p>
    <p>While Sin­ga­pore has faced nu­mer­ous crises in the past, there is some­thing omi­nously dif­fer­ent about the cur­rent one. For the first time in a gen­er­a­tion, there is a real fear that many jobs which are dis­ap­pear­ing will never re­turn due to tech­no­log­i­cal changes and off­shoring.</p>
    <p>This has set off heated dis­course about for­eign work­ers and for­eign tal­ent.</p>
    <p>Many fear that the shrink­ing pool of jobs – es­pe­cially among pro­fes­sion­als, man­agers, engi­neers and tech­ni­cians (PMETs) – has been dis­pro­por­tion­ately taken over by Em­ploy­ment Pass and work pass hold­ers.</p>
    <p>This anx­i­ety is also fu­elling the nar­ra­tive that too many for­eign com­pa­nies and for­eign bosses favour for­eign­ers over Sin­ga­pore­ans at the work­place. There is also sus­pi­cion that many of these jobs – es­pe­cially at the PMET level – can be done by Sin­ga­pore­ans, and that some of these for­eign hires do not re­ally pos­sess the req­ui­site qual­i­fi­ca­tions to be clas­si­fied as for­eign “tal­ent”.</p>
    <p>The truth and ve­rac­ity of all this have yet to be proven. Many of the calls to cull the for­eign work­force have been emo­tive and sup­ported by hearsay and weak anec­do­tal ev­i­dence.</p>
    <p>So let’s ex­am­ine some facts first.</p>
    <p>First, Sin­ga­pore­ans sim­ply are not at­tracted to some jobs, no mat­ter what the salary is.</p>
    <p>Jobs in clean­ing, con­struc­tion, waste man­age­ment, gar­den­ing, health­care, gen­eral main­te­nance, food and bev­er­age, and var­i­ous other blue-col­lar work fall into this cat­e­gory.</p>
    <p>Sec­ond, there are some very spe­cialised jobs – such as in in­for­ma­tion tech­nol­ogy, ad­vanced bio­med­i­cal sci­ences, com­plex risk man­age­ment, and other highly spe­cialised global roles – where there is just not large enough a pool of lo­cal tal­ent.</p>
    <p>Not long ago, For­eign Min­is­ter and Min­is­ter-in-charge of the Smart Na­tion Ini­tia­tive Vi­vian Balakr­ish­nan said that in its push to­wards dig­i­tal­i­sa­tion, Sin­ga­pore would need some 66,000 IT pro­fes­sion­als. While the var­i­ous uni­ver­si­ties, col­leges and poly­tech­nics here pro­duce some 50,000 grad­u­ates ev­ery year, barely 15 per cent come with deep tech­ni­cal skills. And many tech­ni­cal grad­u­ates choose to work in non-tech­ni­cal fields.</p>
    <p>Then there is the is­sue of PMET jobs.</p>
    <p>Yes, there is no doubt that Sin­ga­pore­ans would qual­ify for many of these jobs, es­pe­cially in the fi­nan­cial sec­tor. So there is a jus­ti­fi­ca­tion for putting in place ef­fec­tive mech­a­nisms to en­sure fair hir­ing prac­tices.</p>
    <p>One way might be to en­sure all hu­man re­source staff – and es­pe­cially the heads of hu­man re­sources – in these com­pa­nies are ex­clu­sively Sin­ga­pore­ans.</p>
    <p>And in the case of the fi­nan­cial sec­tor, per­haps the Mon­e­tary Au­thor­ity of Sin­ga­pore could hold quar­terly eval­u­a­tion meet­ings with the man­age­ment.</p>
    <p>But in try­ing to fix these trees, Sin­ga­pore should not lose sight of the for­est.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore owes its suc­cess to its open­ness to for­eign cap­i­tal and tal­ent.</p>
    <p>Xeno­pho­bic rants cre­ate neg­a­tive op­tics which can drive away global com­pa­nies that can of­fer qual­ity jobs.</p>
    <p>The re­cent heated con­ver­sa­tions about for­eign tal­ent have al­ready hit the head­lines of in­ter­na­tional news­pa­pers. One in The Fi­nan­cial Times last week read: “Sin­ga­pore seeks to cut num­ber of ex­pa­tri­ates as re­ces­sion bites: Asian fi­nan­cial hub tight­ens reg­u­la­tions on em­ploy­ing for­eign pro­fes­sion­als.”</p>
    <p>The ar­ti­cle went on to say: “In­ter­na­tional busi­nesses in Sin­ga­pore are fac­ing in­creas­ing bar­ri­ers to hir­ing ex­pa­tri­ates as the Gov­ern­ment seeks to as­suage do­mes­tic po­lit­i­cal con­cerns over soar­ing un­em­ploy­ment in the Asian fi­nan­cial cen­tre. De­spite in­creas­ing in­ter­est among global com­pa­nies in us­ing Sin­ga­pore as an al­ter­na­tive re­gional base to Hong Kong, au­thor­i­ties in Sin­ga­pore last week tight­ened cri­te­ria for hir­ing for­eign pro­fes­sion­als.”</p>
    <p>Not ex­actly the right mes­sage for a small, open econ­omy.</p>
    <p>As Prime Min­is­ter Lee Hsien Loong put it, Sin­ga­pore must con­tinue to wel­come tal­ent and in­vest­ment that cre­ates op­por­tu­ni­ties for its peo­ple, and main­tain its rep­u­ta­tion for open­ness.</p>
    <p>While mea­sures must be taken to mit­i­gate the bias in hir­ing, one must also be aware that the world is bor­der­less to tal­ent.</p>
    <p>To­day, an in­ter­na­tional com­pany with op­er­a­tional head­quar­ters in Sin­ga­pore, Shang­hai or Syd­ney can em­ploy thou­sands of spe­cial­ists, tech­nol­o­gists, de­sign­ers, mar­ket­ing ex­ec­u­tives and oth­ers in Ban­ga­lore, Ban­gor or Baguio.</p>
    <p>The im­pact of this can fil­ter down to all seg­ments of the lo­cal econ­omy.</p>
    <p>For now, the Repub­lic is still at­tract­ing tens of bil­lions of dol­lars of in­vest­ment com­mit­ments.</p>
    <p>This year alone, the likes of Hyundai, Tata Con­sul­tancy, ExxonMo­bil, Mi­cron Tech­nol­ogy, STMi­cro­elec­tron­ics, Rakuten Mo­bile, Twit­ter, Thermo Fisher Sci­en­tific and BASF are among the global giants ex­pand­ing or es­tab­lish­ing re­gional head­quar­ters and recruiting here in Sin­ga­pore. Mean­while, e-com­merce plat­forms Lazada and Shopee are hir­ing for roles in data an­a­lyt­ics, busi­ness devel­op­ment and prod­uct devel­op­ment to cater for the rise of on­line shop­ping.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore must pro­duce enough qual­i­fied peo­ple to take up roles at all lev­els in these in­ter­na­tional com­pa­nies. And for­eign­ers who do come to work here must be those who are able to add value to Sin­ga­pore and its busi­ness propo­si­tion.</p>
    <p>But the bot­tom line is that Sin­ga­pore can­not do with­out for­eign work­ers.</p>
    <p>The re­al­ity is that Sin­ga­pore will al­ways need a suf­fi­cient pool of for­eign tal­ent with spe­cialised skills. But they should sup­ple­ment a sta­ble lo­cal core com­pris­ing Sin­ga­pore­ans and per­ma­nent res­i­dents.</p>
    <p>Na­tivism is not what a small econ­omy which is highly de­pen­dent on for­eign in­vest­ment, free trade and open bor­ders needs right now.</p>
    <p>Pan­demics pass. Rep­u­ta­tion lingers.</p>
