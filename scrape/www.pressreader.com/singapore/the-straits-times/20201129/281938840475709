    <p>The sight and sound of in­fants laugh­ing are among the rea­sons Ms Jacintha Jayadas looks for­ward to her work as an early child­hood ed­u­ca­tor. The 27-year-old said even on week­ends, when she is off, she misses the chil­dren.</p>
    <p>Ms Jacintha, who is sin­gle, now works at Tots and Ted­dies in Telok Ayer, hav­ing made the switch in 2017 after be­ing a nurse for two years.</p>
    <p>De­spite ini­tial wor­ries that she might not be able to han­dle the work, she feels more con­fi­dent now in car­ing for in­fants aged two months to 18 months. This is due to guid­ance she re­ceived from se­nior teach­ers, prin­ci­pals and oth­ers, she said.</p>
    <p>Ms Jacintha, who has a diploma in coun­selling, is among 17 preschool ed­u­ca­tors and eight cen­tres to re­ceive awards for Ex­cel­lence in Early Child­hood De­vel­op­ment in a vir­tual cer­e­mony held yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The awards are meant to high­light the pro­fes­sion­al­ism of the early child­hood sec­tor and recog­nise out­stand­ing and promis­ing early child­hood ed­u­ca­tors and cen­tres, ac­cord­ing to the Early Child­hood De­vel­op­ment Agency.</p>
    <p>Ms Jacintha re­ceived the Promis­ing Early Child­hood Ed­u­carer Award for her work in build­ing re­la­tion­ships with the fam­i­lies of the chil­dren as well as the qual­ity of her care for the in­fants.</p>
    <p>Among the cen­tres that won awards is Chatsworth Preschool, which has two cam­puses here. It re­ceived the Early Child­hood In­no­va­tion Award (Dis­tinc­tion) for its Lan­guage of Food pro­ject, which aims to cul­ti­vate re­spon­si­bil­ity dur­ing meal­times.</p>
    <p>Its cen­tre at Pic­cadilly Cir­cus in Sele­tar got tod­dlers in­volved in a num­ber of ac­tiv­i­ties, from food prepa­ra­tion to clean­ing up the kitchen space. It also cus­tomised</p>
    <p>and in­te­grated the food pantry into the class­room, so that meal­times could be­come part of the cur­ricu­lum with chil­dren pick­ing up skills such as lan­guage, nu­mer­acy and mo­tor co­or­di­na­tion.</p>
    <p>In a pre-recorded video for the cer­e­mony, Min­is­ter for So­cial and Fam­ily De­vel­op­ment Masagos Zulkifli said the award win­ners show­case qual­ity stan­dards in teach­ing, car­ing, lead­er­ship and in­no­va­tion in the early child­hood sec­tor.</p>
    <p>“But they are just the tip of the ice­berg. Be­yond the vis­i­ble are thou­sands of ed­u­ca­tors who con­tinue to give their best every day, in­spir­ing, teach­ing, car­ing for, and nur­tur­ing our chil­dren,” he noted.</p>
    <p>“I hope that all our early child­hood pro­fes­sion­als will con­tinue to strive for ex­cel­lence as a fra­ter­nity and cheer one an­other on, as we work to­wards a com­mon goal of giv­ing every child a good start in life,” added Mr Masagos, who also said early child­hood pro­fes­sion­als are the heart of qual­ity preschools.</p>
    <p>“A good ed­u­ca­tor makes a good pre-school, which pro­duces happy and well-de­vel­oped chil­dren,” said Mr Masagos.</p>
    <p>Ms Jacintha is cur­rently en­rolled in a part-time de­gree pro­gramme in Early Child­hood Guid­ance and Coun­selling. She will grad­u­ate in March next year.</p>
    <p>“With train­ing in coun­selling, I can help more chil­dren ad­dress prob­lems or sit­u­a­tions they may face,” she said.</p>
    <p>Her nurs­ing ex­pe­ri­ence has helped. When some­thing hap­pens, such as an ac­ci­dent or a fall, she is able to re­spond quickly.</p>
    <p>“I im­me­di­ately know my next course of ac­tion, and I’m not afraid of blood or bruises, and I can think on my feet,” said Ms Jacintha.</p>
    <p>She en­joys her work as an in­fant ed­u­carer, as she feels it is at this stage in their lives where one can re­ally make a dif­fer­ence.</p>
    <p>“I can con­trib­ute to the first step that they take, the first words they speak,” she said. “I feel like I help the par­ents the most at the in­fant stage be­cause many of them are first-time par­ents,” she added.</p>
    <p>CON­TINUE TO GIVE THEIR BEST Be­yond the vis­i­ble are thou­sands of ed­u­ca­tors who con­tinue to give their best every day, in­spir­ing, teach­ing, car­ing for, and nur­tur­ing our chil­dren.</p>
