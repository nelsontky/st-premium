    <p>Old age is a strange bless­ing.</p>
    <p>The body ex­ists, but only as a mock­ing re­minder of its former form and func­tion.</p>
    <p>Once, it took 50 laugh­ing sec­onds for a child to run from the play­ground to her mother’s waiting arms. Now, there is no mother, no play­ground, no mis­chief, no laugh­ter, no scold­ing and no love. Fa­ther, too, has gone. To­day, it takes for­ever to get nowhere.</p>
    <p>Of course, peo­ple have chil­dren and grand­chil­dren. But the chil­dren have grown up, and there al­ways is a chance of drop­ping in­fants from limbs wasted by arthri­tis, di­a­betes or some other chronic af­flic­tion. Tan­gi­bil­ity re­cedes from the body. De­men­tia prom­ises to wipe the mind clean of it­self if it ar­rives.</p>
    <p>That is why gardening and re­li­gion are two sta­ples of age­ing days.</p>
    <p>Plant­ing seeds, nurs­ing the soil, keep­ing dis­eases at bay and see­ing flow­ers bloom one un­sus­pected day re-en­act what women and men did in their fam­i­lies be­fore re­pro­duc­tion was taken out of their bi­o­log­i­cal reach. Now, they re­pay their debt to na­ture be­cause ev­ery flower is a per­sonal trib­ute to a process that cel­e­brates the cease­less re­newal of life.</p>
    <p>Un­for­tu­nately, gar­den­ers do no more than wel­come flow­ers into a com­mon world of death. Hence the search for some­thing greater: the prom­ise of a place in the af­ter­life. There, hu­mans and flow­ers both may bloom for­ever. The el­derly flock to places of wor­ship, cer­tainly to pray for their de­scen­dants, but also to re­serve their place on the com­ing jour­ney to the as­cen­dant.</p>
    <p>The clas­sics cel­e­brate the ev­ery­day bat­tles of mor­tals with old age.</p>
    <p>The pro­tag­o­nist in the Al­bert Ca­mus novella, The Fall, is faced with a frightenin­g prospect: “Noth­ing re­mained but to grow older.”</p>
    <p>In his own plain­tive reck­on­ing with time, the Urdu poet Faiz Ahmed Faiz imag­ines his youth­ful love as a coun­try whose ge­og­ra­phy and his­tory have vanished, leav­ing him and mem­ory be­hind. “I have reached that age/when one vis­its the heart only as a cour­tesy.”</p>
    <p>How­ever, the old can reign if they know when and how to ac­quire a king­dom.</p>
    <p>The poet Wil­liam Butler Yeats sug­gests the fol­low­ing. “Get all the gold and sil­ver that you can,/Sat­isfy am­bi­tion, an­i­mate/The triv­ial days and ram them with the sun,” he writes. Yet, “from the for­ti­eth win­ter”, he adds: “Be­gin the prepa­ra­tion for your death.”</p>
    <p>How? “Test ev­ery work of in­tel­lect or faith,/And ev­ery­thing that your own hands have wrought,/And call those works ex­trav­a­gance of breath/That are not suited for such men as come/proud, open-eyed and laugh­ing to the tomb.”</p>
    <p>To have lived to the cre­ative full is to be pre­pared for death. All else is idle fear.</p>
    <p>Hence, Stavro­gin asks in Fy­o­dor Dos­to­evsky’s novel, The Pos­sessed: “Do you be­lieve in eter­nal life in the other world?”</p>
    <p>Kir­ilov replies: “No, but in eter­nal life in this world.”</p>
    <p>Death is pow­er­less be­fore a life that has been grasped in the mer­ci­less vi­tal­ity of its pas­sage.</p>
    <p>That grasp ex­plains why Hal­vard Sol­ness, the mid­dle-aged ar­chi­tect in Hen­rik Ib­sen’s The Master Builder, is ob­sessed with suc­cess. His re­la­tion­ship with a younger woman reignites his de­sire for great­ness. It is em­bod­ied duly in a build­ing that in­cludes a tow­er­ing steeple.</p>
    <p>In spite of his fear of ex­treme heights, he ful­fils her de­sire to see him climb the steeple at the public open­ing of the build­ing. He reaches the top of the tower, loses his foot­ing and falls to his death as she ex­claims: “My-my Master Builder!”</p>
    <p>He dies happy, one sus­pects. Although he will not build mas­ter­pieces any more, he has be­come her ev­er­last­ing mas­ter­piece.</p>
    <p>The final mo­ments of Sol­ness fore­tell the ar­rival of the char­ac­ter in Mi­lan Kun­dera’s The Book Of Laugh­ter And For­get­ting, who “had the feel­ing he could not wait much longer, be­cause his des­tiny was rapidly com­ing to its end and he must do ev­ery­thing to make it perfect and beau­ti­ful”.</p>
    <p>Therein lies the key to fruit­ful old age: try­ing to make life as perfect and beau­ti­ful as pos­si­ble for the ar­riv­ing young.</p>
    <p>For some­one like Dan­ish philoso­pher Soren Kierkegaar­d, the youth of oth­ers is the best re­ward for an age­ing faith.</p>
    <p>He ex­plains Abra­ham’s obe­di­ence to the di­vine com­mand that he sac­ri­fice his son Isaac:</p>
    <p>“No one shall be for­got­ten who was great in this world; but ev­ery­one was great in his own way, and ev­ery­one in pro­por­tion to the great­ness of what he loved (em­pha­sis in orig­i­nal).”</p>
    <p>Abra­ham’s love of his son was great in pro­por­tion to his greater love of God, who put him to the test. Isaac lived. The an­cient weight of obe­di­ence car­ried by old Abra­ham has shifted to the shoul­ders of a thou­sand young Isaacs to­day.</p>
    <p>Un­for­tu­nately, although all Isaacs are Isaacs, not all Isaacs are equal. That dif­fer­ence would be in­tol­er­a­ble to Elaine Scarry, for whom equal­ity lies at the heart of the beauty (and hence the per­fec­tion) that makes des­tiny worth pur­su­ing in Kun­dera’s ele­giac world. A beau­ti­fully perfect fu­ture would be one in which the young wel­come time as another op­por­tu­nity to pre­pare the world for the equal ex­is­tence of all.</p>
    <p>Abra­ham would have un­der­stood this logic. If hu­mans owe an equal de­gree of obe­di­ence to their Creator, that Be­ing can­not but ex­pect obe­di­ence with­out hav­ing planted the seeds of equal­ity in hu­mans.</p>
    <p>Equal­ity lev­els the ma­te­rial play­ing field in or­der to so­cialise in­di­vid­ual tal­ent. That takes time.</p>
    <p>The old will wither and die.</p>
    <p>But their pas­sage will last in the com­ing lives of the young.</p>
    <p>It is never too late to start grow­ing old.</p>
