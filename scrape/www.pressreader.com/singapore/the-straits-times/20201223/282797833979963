    <p>Aries (March 21 - April 19)</p>
    <p>It is a time for new ac­tiv­i­ties, so try to fig­ure out what is next for you.</p>
    <p>You have en­ergy to burn and it has to be used soon.</p>
    <p>Tau­rus (April 20 - May 20)</p>
    <p>Take ex­tra time when mak­ing de­ci­sions, even if one per­son is try­ing to pres­sure you to make a quick call. Hold your ground.</p>
    <p>Gem­ini (May 21 - June 20)</p>
    <p>Some­one far out on your net­work can help out tremen­dously.</p>
    <p>Ask around and see if you can fig­ure out who knows what.</p>
    <p>Can­cer (June 21 - July 22)</p>
    <p>An au­thor­ity fig­ure is mak­ing your life mis­er­able, although that is a two-way street. See if you can pull back from what­ever con­fronta­tion is brew­ing.</p>
    <p>Leo (July 23 - Aug 22)</p>
    <p>You are hav­ing a blast, now that your mind is fully en­gaged with the day’s ac­tiv­i­ties. You have a smile even dur­ing the most bor­ing of pre­sen­ta­tions.</p>
    <p>Virgo (Aug 23 - Sept 22)</p>
    <p>Your en­ergy lev­els are high and you should find that you can take on al­most any­thing. You are sure to be in de­mand as oth­ers see what you are ca­pa­ble of.</p>
    <p>Li­bra (Sept 23 - Oct 22)</p>
    <p>Your work­ing re­la­tion­ships are key to your suc­cess. One con­tact may be able to hook you up with some­one else you can profit from nicely.</p>
    <p>Scor­pio (Oct 23 - Nov 21)</p>
    <p>Take your fit­ness more se­ri­ously, so hit the gym, take the stairs or try bik­ing to work. You have the right kind of en­ergy to fo­cus on your body.</p>
    <p>Sagit­tar­ius (Nov 22 - Dec 21)</p>
    <p>Your pow­er­ful, ac­tive en­ergy makes the world your oys­ter. Rack up many suc­cesses as you ex­plore new ways to leave your mark.</p>
    <p>Capri­corn (Dec 22 - Jan 19) You are more wor­ried than usual, but your wor­ries might ac­tu­ally in­spire some pos­i­tive ef­fect, so think hard and then get busy. Aquar­ius (Jan 20 - Feb 18)</p>
    <p>Your al­tru­is­tic side is out on dis­play, so get your friends to let you know what they need or look to­wards the com­mu­nity and help in a big­ger way.</p>
    <p>Pisces (Feb 19 - March 20)</p>
    <p>You can­not make out the re­al­ity be­hind the trou­bles at work or at home. That is okay – things will clear up and move along fairly soon.</p>
