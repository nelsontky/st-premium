    <p>For the past eight months, mi­grant worker Vas­anth has been con­fined mainly to his dor­mi­tory, leav­ing it only for work or the oc­ca­sional trip to a nearby recre­ational cen­tre.</p>
    <p>So the 24-year-old, who goes by one name, wel­comed the break from his daily rou­tine last night when he was taken on a bus tour to see the Christ­mas lights here.</p>
    <p>“I feel very nice and re­freshed. The last few months we didn’t get to take the MRT or buses, so it’s a good feel­ing to be able to see how Sin­ga­pore is after a few months. To­day, I felt the same way I did when I first came here and saw Sin­ga­pore,” said Mr Vas­anth, who ar­rived from In­dia two years ago and is in charge of worker safety on con­struc­tion sites.</p>
    <p>It was his first time see­ing Ma­rina Bay and the lights in the city, he said.</p>
    <p>Mr Vas­anth was one of about 165 mi­grant work­ers who went on the tour to places such as Or­chard Road and Lit­tle In­dia. It was or­gan­ised by Its Rain­ing Rain­coats, a so­cial en­ter­prise that sup­ports the needs of mi­grant work­ers here.</p>
    <p>Ms Dipa Swami­nathan, founder of Its Rain­ing Rain coats, said :“Mi­grant work­ers still don’t have the free­dom to move around freely as the rest of us do. For many of them, life just re­volves around their lodg­ing and work­place. After the dra­matic year they have had... we thought it would be nice to give them an out­ing they can re­mem­ber and en­joy.”</p>
    <p>Mi­grant work­ers were the worst hit by the coro­n­avirus in Sin­ga­pore, with 152,794 test­ing pos­i­tive for Covid-19 as at Dec 13, form­ing the vast ma­jor­ity of cases re­ported here. Their dor­mi­to­ries were placed on strict lock­down and they were cir­cum­scribed in where and how they could move around.</p>
    <p>Its Rain­ing Rain coats plans to org anise about 20 bus tours over the next cou­ple of months for about 650 work­ers.</p>
    <p>Be­sides en­joy­ing the fes­tive lights, work­ers re­ceived a care pack with items such as soap, tooth­paste and de­odor­ant. They also took part in quizzes on the bus, and were treated to drinks and snacks.</p>
    <p>The tour was or­gan­ised in col­lab­o­ra­tion with the Min­istry of Man­power (MOM) and sup­ported by the High Com­mis­sion of In­dia, the Pan In­dian In­sti­tute of Man­age­ment Alumni and mem­bers of the pub­lic.</p>
    <p>Mr Koh Tee Meng, deputy com­man­der of Re­gional Com­mand (East) of MOM’s As­sur­ance, Care and En­gage­ment Group, said: “It is heart­en­ing to see the va­ri­ety of ef­forts from the com­mu­nity to bring joy to our mi­grant work­ers, es­pe­cially dur­ing this fes­tive sea­son.”</p>
    <p>He added that his group looks for­ward to work­ing more with such groups in the com­ing year.</p>
    <p>Site se­nior su­per­vi­sor Sun­daram Magesh, 35, who ar­rived from In­dia 15 years ago, said he en­joyed the tour and would hap­pily go again if an­other was or­gan­ised.</p>
    <p>“(Pre­vi­ously I was) al­ways in­side the room. But to­day I went out, I feel re­laxed, with the nat­u­ral light­ing,” he said.</p>
    <p>He added that while he un­der­stood the need for re­stric­tions, he looks for­ward to the day when he can go swim­ming again at West Coast Park.</p>
    <p>“When they open (re­stric­tions), I’ll go – I miss swim­ming very much,” he said.</p>
