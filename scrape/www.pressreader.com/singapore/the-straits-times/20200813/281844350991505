    <p>Sen­a­tor Ka­mala Har­ris has rel­a­tively lim­ited ex­pe­ri­ence when it comes to for­eign pol­icy and is un­likely to call the shots on Amer­ica’s for­eign affairs un­der a Bi­den ad­min­is­tra­tion.</p>
    <p>Her po­lit­i­cal ca­reer has been more ori­ented to­wards do­mes­tic pol­icy, par­tic­u­larly crim­i­nal jus­tice re­form, given her nearly three decades of ex­pe­ri­ence as a prose­cu­tor and, later, at­tor­ney-gen­eral of Cal­i­for­nia.</p>
    <p>Vice-pres­i­dents are not tra­di­tion­ally the main set­ters of for­eign pol­icy for the United States, and Mr Bi­den, who turns 78 this year, al­ready has a vast net­work of more than 2,000 coun­try and re­gional ex­pert ad­vis­ers whom he can tap should he be­come pres­i­dent, ac­cord­ing to a re­port by For­eign Pol­icy mag­a­zine last month.</p>
    <p>Nonethe­less, vice-pres­i­dents can and have wielded in­flu­ence over for­eign affairs, par­tic­u­larly if they are tasked to over­see spe­cific is­sues and re­la­tion­ships.</p>
    <p>Mr Bi­den, a long-time mem­ber and later leader of the Se­nate For­eign Re­la­tions Com­mit­tee, even­tu­ally took point on US re­la­tions with Iraq and Ukraine when he was vice-pres­i­dent to Mr Barack Obama.</p>
    <p>The for­eign pol­icy po­si­tions Ms Har­ris, 55, has ar­tic­u­lated so far sug­gest that she is broadly in line with Mr Bi­den and the Demo­cratic es­tab­lish­ment on China and other is­sues.</p>
    <p>She is less fo­cused on Amer­ica’s strate­gic com­pe­ti­tion with China, which she barely men­tions, in con­trast to the Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion’s con­fronta­tional ap­proach to great power com­pe­ti­tion and its re­peated high­light­ing of the na­tional se­cu­rity threats China poses.</p>
    <p>She has said that she sup­ports Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump’s goal of end­ing China’s un­fair trade prac­tices, but re­jects tar­iffs as a way of do­ing so.</p>
    <p>In an Au­gust 2018 let­ter writ­ten with her fel­low Cal­i­for­nia Sen­a­tor Dianne Fe­in­stein, Ms Har­ris said that the Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion’s tar­iffs “are coun­ter­pro­duc­tive to its goal of en­sur­ing a level play­ing field for Amer­i­can com­pa­nies” and would hurt Cal­i­for­nia’s consumer elec­tron­ics in­dus­try.</p>
    <p>Ms Har­ris’ 500-word state­ment on for­eign pol­icy, pub­lished on the web­site set up for her un­suc­cess­ful pres­i­den­tial bid, is also light on de­tails.</p>
    <p>She wrote that “Amer­ica must fight along­side friends and al­lies – not alone”, and crit­i­cised Mr Trump for un­der­min­ing part­ner­ships and in­sti­tu­tions dur­ing his pres­i­dency.</p>
    <p>But con­fronting China’s un­fair trade prac­tices mer­ited only a five-word men­tion in the cat­e­gory of global chal­lenges, in the same breath as North Korea and Iran’s nu­clear threats and Rus­sian cy­ber at­tacks on Amer­ica’s democ­racy, and with no de­tails on how to do so.</p>
    <p>In­stead, Ms Har­ris is much more vo­cal on hu­man rights abuses than on great power com­pe­ti­tion.</p>
    <p>In an in­ter­view in July last year with the Wash­ing­ton-based Coun­cil on For­eign Re­la­tions (CFR) think-tank, she said that “China’s abysmal hu­man rights record must fea­ture promi­nently in US pol­icy to­wards the coun­try”, adding that she would not ig­nore China’s mass de­ten­tion of Uighur Mus­lims or its un­der­min­ing of Hong Kong’s au­ton­omy.</p>
    <p>The sen­a­tor co-spon­sored the Uighur Hu­man Rights Pol­icy Act and backed the Hong Kong Hu­man Rights and Democ­racy Act, both of which sanc­tion Chi­nese of­fi­cials.</p>
    <p>She told CFR: “Un­der my ad­min­is­tra­tion, we will co­op­er­ate with China on global is­sues like cli­mate change, but we won’t al­low hu­man rights abuses to go unchecked.</p>
    <p>“The United States must re­claim our own moral au­thor­ity and work with like-minded na­tions to stand up force­fully for hu­man rights in China and around the world.”</p>
    <p>Ms Har­ris also called cli­mate co­op­er­a­tion a “key diplo­matic pri­or­ity for the United States”, say­ing on her web­site that she would im­me­di­ately re-en­ter the Paris Agree­ment, the global pact to fight cli­mate change which the Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion pulled the US out of.</p>
    <p>How­ever, she is not a fan of the Trans-Pa­cific Part­ner­ship (TPP), and is un­likely to cham­pion the US re­join­ing the re­gional trade pact which the Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion also with­drew from.</p>
    <p>“I will op­pose any trade deal that doesn’t look out for the best in­ter­ests of Amer­i­can work­ers and raise en­vi­ron­men­tal stan­dards, and un­for­tu­nately the TPP didn’t pass ei­ther test,” she told CFR.</p>
    <p>Ms Har­ris also has a per­sonal con­nec­tion to In­dia: Her grand­fa­ther was an In­dian diplo­mat, and she is the first Amer­i­can of In­dian de­scent to run on a ma­jor party’s pres­i­den­tial ticket.</p>
    <p>But while she has called In­dia a key part­ner, she has not made clear how she sees In­dia fac­tor­ing into Amer­ica’s net­work of al­liances and part­ner­ships.</p>
    <p>Ms Har­ris is less fo­cused on Amer­ica’s strate­gic com­pe­ti­tion with China, which she barely men­tions, in con­trast to the Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion’s con­fronta­tional ap­proach to great power com­pe­ti­tion and its re­peated high­light­ing of the na­tional se­cu­rity threats China poses.</p>
    <p>She has said that she sup­ports Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump’s goal of end­ing China’s un­fair trade prac­tices, but re­jects tar­iffs as a way of do­ing so.</p>
