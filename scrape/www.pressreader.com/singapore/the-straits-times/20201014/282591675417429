    <p>MUM­BAI • Bol­ly­wood’s top pro­duc­ers have filed a law­suit against two tele­vi­sion news chan­nels for paint­ing the film in­dus­try as a den of drugs and crime fol­low­ing the death of a young movie star, they said.</p>
    <p>Sushant Singh Ra­jput (above), 34, was found dead in his Mum­bai apart­ment in June in what po­lice ini­tially said ap­peared to be a case of sui­cide.</p>
    <p>His death un­leashed fren­zied me­dia cov­er­age with tele­vi­sion chan­nels show­ing his body, analysing his med­i­cal pre­scrip­tions and sug­gest­ing “black magic” was per­formed on the ac­tor.</p>
    <p>The me­dia also tar­geted his girl­friend Rhea Chakrabort­y, 28, who was even­tu­ally de­tained for drug con­sump­tion.</p>
    <p>The suit, filed in the Delhi High Court, has more than 30 Bol­ly­wood pro­duc­tion houses and four in­dus­try bod­ies as plain­tiffs and refers to the cov­er­age of Ra­jput’s death.</p>
    <p>“The pri­vacy of the mem­bers of Bol­ly­wood is be­ing in­vaded, and their rep­u­ta­tions are be­ing ir­repara­bly dam­aged by paint­ing the en­tire Bol­ly­wood as crim­i­nals, seeped in drug cul­ture, and mak­ing be­ing part of Bol­ly­wood as syn­ony­mous with crim­i­nal acts in the pub­lic imag­i­na­tion,” the pro­duc­ers said in a state­ment.</p>
    <p>They named Repub­lic TV and its founder Arnab Goswami, as well as Times Now, in the law­suit filed in the Delhi High Court.</p>
    <p>Rep­re­sen­ta­tives of both chan­nels did not im­me­di­ately re­spond to a re­quest for com­ment. A lawyer for the pro­duc­ers could not be reached.</p>
    <p>Those who filed the suit in­clude The Pro­duc­ers Guild of In­dia, the Screen­writ­ers As­so­ci­a­tion as well as pro­duc­tion com­pa­nies be­long­ing to top Bol­ly­wood ac­tors Shah Rukh Khan, Sal­man Khan and Aamir Khan.</p>
    <p>It was un­clear when the case would come up for hear­ing.</p>
    <p>Repub­lic TV and Times Now have cov­ered Ra­jput’s death and the cir­cum­stances around it re­lent­lessly, lead­ing to crit­i­cism from jour­nal­ists and so­cial me­dia users.</p>
    <p>“These de­fen­dants are con­duct­ing and pub­lish­ing par­al­lel pri­vate ‘in­ves­ti­ga­tions’ and ef­fec­tively act­ing as ‘courts’ to con­demn per­sons con­nected with Bol­ly­wood as guilty based on what they claim is ‘ev­i­dence’ found by them,” the pro­duc­ers’ state­ment said, re­fer­ring to the two news chan­nels.</p>
