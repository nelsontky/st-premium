    <p>The first two episodes of the new sea­son of The Good Doc­tor poignantly recre­ate the early weeks of the Covid-19 crisis in the United States and its dev­as­tat­ing ef­fects on pa­tients and staff at the Cal­i­for­nia hos­pi­tal where the show is set.</p>
    <p>The hit med­i­cal drama, which de­buted in 2017 and airs on Tues­days on Fox Life (Sing­tel TV Chan­nel 301, StarHub TV Chan­nel 501 and stream­ing on Fox+), stars Fred­die High­more as Dr Shaun Mur­phy, a young sur­geon who is an autis­tic sa­vant – some­thing that makes him a bril­liant di­ag­nos­ti­cian, but in­fin­itely com­pli­cates his in­ter­ac­tions and re­la­tion­ships.</p>
    <p>High­more, who picked up a Golden Globe nom­i­na­tion for the role, chat­ted with The Straits Times and other me­dia by video call from Vancouver re­cently.</p>
    <p>He says the show wanted to pay trib­ute to front-line health­care work­ers and re­mind view­ers of what many of them have sac­ri­ficed, es­pe­cially dur­ing the most intense months of the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>“The most im­por­tant thing for all of us was to pay trib­ute to the reallife health­care pro­fes­sion­als and front-line work­ers, who have been go­ing through some in­cred­i­bly tough times that it’s hard to imag­ine,” says the 28-year-old English ac­tor, who pre­vi­ously starred in the psy­cho­log­i­cal drama Bates Mo­tel (2013 to 2017).</p>
    <p>Th­ese heroic ef­forts have re­minded the cast of the show – a re­make of the 2013 South Korean drama of the same name – that what they do as ac­tors pales in com­par­i­son.</p>
    <p>“We only pre­tend to be doc­tors on tele­vi­sion and it’s put into per­spec­tive their gen­uine hero­ism. So, it would’ve felt wrong to not make ref­er­ence to it and use this op­por­tu­nity to pay trib­ute to that.”</p>
    <p>Yet, the se­ries also sought to strike a hope­ful note with th­ese episodes.</p>
    <p>“Yes, it’s been an i ncred­i­bly trau­matic time for every­one, but at the same time, as the show has al­ways done, it seeks to find th­ese lit­tle moments of hope and op­ti­mism even in the sad­ness.”</p>
    <p>It also shows the staff at St Bon­aven­ture Hos­pi­tal’s sur­gi­cal unit car­ry­ing on with their own lives as they deal with the un­cer­tainty of the out­break.</p>
    <p>This in­cludes Dr Mur­phy’s blos­som­ing ro­mance with l ove in­ter­est Lea (Paige Spara), who of­fi­cially be­came his girl­friend last sea­son.</p>
    <p>“I think every­one in the world who’s been go­ing through this has learnt to ap­pre­ci­ate or find th­ese sil­ver lin­ings in life – the small gath­er­ings with friends, things we may have pre­vi­ously taken for granted, and our show seeks to mine that at the start of Sea­son 4,” High­more says.</p>
    <p>At the same time, the de­ci­sion was made to limit the Covid-19 sto­ry­line to the first two episodes of the new sea­son.</p>
    <p>“Be­yond that, we won’t be fo­cus­ing on the coro­n­avirus – the show will move past that be­ing the fo­cus for the ma­jor­ity of the sea­son, which also felt right,” he adds.</p>
    <p>The Good Doc­tor has moved on from the ini­tial shock and dis­rup­tion of the coro­n­avirus out­break and, as with many Hol­ly­wood pro­duc­tions, in­tro­duced a slew of new health and safety pro­to­cols on set.</p>
    <p>High­more wel­comes this, but ad­mits he misses the pa­per scripts he used to learn his lines from.</p>
    <p>“This sea­son, I’ve got this,” he says, pick­ing up an Ap­ple iPad. “I was used to my hard-copy scripts – I en­joyed writ­ing my notes on them and it felt nice hav­ing a huge pile of them.</p>
    <p>“And now, I’ve be­come all mod­ern be­cause it’s one of the many pro­to­cols on set to limit the amount of pa­per that’s shared and peo­ple hand­ing things to one another.”</p>
    <p>“But I’m still as ex­cited to read the script, even though it now takes a dif­fer­ent form,” he adds.</p>
    <p>Above all, he feels “very lucky to have re­mained safe and healthy” through the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>“We had just fin­ished film­ing that week when the world seemed to change – and did change. And I think it’s made us all aware of the ways in which we’re for­tu­nate.”</p>
