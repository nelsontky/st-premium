    <p>It read a lit­tle like a ro­mance novel.</p>
    <p>Separated by the Pa­cific Ocean and a long­stand­ing travel ban to the United States, In­done­sian De­fence Min­is­ter Prabowo Subianto spoke to United States De­fence Sec­re­tary Mark Esper by phone a few times on de­fence co­op­er­a­tion be­tween their coun­tries.</p>
    <p>On at least two oc­ca­sions – March 31 and Aug 4 – both had “con­veyed their de­sire to meet soon”, ac­cord­ing to US De­part­ment of De­fence state­ments.</p>
    <p>Mr Esper had ex­pressed his in­ten­tion to visit In­done­sia in July. By early this month, this was re­placed with an in­vi­ta­tion for Mr Prabowo to travel to Washington in­stead.</p>
    <p>On Oct 15, two days be­fore his 69th birthday, Mr Prabowo started the five-day trip, ef­fec­tively end­ing two decades of be­ing black­listed by the US over al­leged hu­man rights abuses.</p>
    <p>The diplo­matic move by the US was aimed at clos­ing ranks with In­done­sia and tem­per­ing China’s bur­geon­ing po­lit­i­cal and eco­nomic clout in the coun­try and the re­gion, ex­perts told The Straits Times.</p>
    <p>“The US is try­ing to get closer to In­done­sia, as it has grown con­cerned over China’s grow­ing in­flu­ence in the re­gion, in­clud­ing In­done­sia,” Dr Yo­hanes Su­laiman, a po­lit­i­cal and se­cu­rity an­a­lyst from Jen­deral Ach­mad Yani Univer­sity, said.</p>
    <p>“And truly, I think this is a very over­due move, which re­flects the lack of at­ten­tion the Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion gives to the re­gion,” he added.</p>
    <p>Un­til last week, the US had re­mained out of bounds to the re­tired spe­cial forces gen­eral, shut out since 2000 over ac­cu­sa­tions of his in­volve­ment in kid­nap­ping ac­tivists dur­ing his fa­ther-in-law pres­i­dent Suharto’s New Or­der regime, which fell in May 1998.</p>
    <p>As In­done­sia’s De­fence Min­is­ter, a sur­prise job of­fered by his erst­while po­lit­i­cal foe-turned-boss, Pres­i­dent Joko Wi­dodo, fol­low­ing a bit­terly fought elec­tion in April last year, Mr Prabowo has since criss-crossed the globe – to China, Rus­sia, Ja­pan, and the Philip­pines, among oth­ers – to en­gage in “de­fence diplo­macy”.</p>
    <p>De­fence com­mu­ni­ca­tion has deep­ened be­tween In­done­sia and China since Mr Prabowo’s visit to Beijing last De­cem­ber, just two months af­ter he was sworn in as min­is­ter.</p>
    <p>Mr Prabowo also per­son­ally wel­comed at the air­port med­i­cal sup­plies flown in from China for the coun­try’s Covid-19 fight in March.</p>
    <p>His re­cent trip to the US, how­ever, must not be mis­un­der­stood as an in­di­ca­tion that Jakarta is lean­ing to­wards Washington. Af­ter all, In­done­sia has al­ways prac­tised a “free and ac­tive” for­eign pol­icy, said Dr Su­san­ingtyas Ker­topati, a mil­i­tary ex­pert from In­done­sia De­fence Univer­sity.</p>
    <p>This means play­ing an ac­tive role in in­ter­na­tional relations, while not tak­ing sides in ri­val­ries.</p>
    <p>“In­done­sia is free to es­tab­lish relations with the US and China si­mul­ta­ne­ously in a bal­anced man­ner with­out any pres­sure,” she told The Straits Times.</p>
    <p>Ne­go­ti­a­tions would have likely taken place be­hind closed doors, es­pe­cially on the con­tentious South China Sea is­sue where six coun­tries stake over­lap­ping claims, Na­tional Mar­itime In­sti­tute ex­ec­u­tive direc­tor Siswanto Rusdi said.</p>
    <p>“The US wants In­done­sia as the largest coun­try in South-east Asia to be ac­tively in­volved in ‘deal­ing with’ China in the South China Sea. Mr Prabowo knows ex­actly the cen­tral­ity of that role in the po­lit­i­cal con­stel­la­tion of the US,” he told The Straits Times.</p>
    <p>“In­done­sia-China relations are al­ready so deep, es­pe­cially in the area of econ­omy. Re­quests by the US will pose a dilemma,” he added.</p>
    <p>Could this mean In­done­sia may just host US spy planes in ex­change for mod­ern weaponry sys­tem? Not likely, ex­perts say. Af­ter all, Mr Prabowo is also an able and com­pe­tent de­fence min­is­ter, at­tuned to geopo­lit­i­cal re­al­i­ties and strate­gic chal­lenges faced by his coun­try.</p>
    <p>“My take is, In­done­sia will not en­ter into any com­mit­ment that could of­fend Beijing,” Mr Siswanto said.</p>
    <p>Be­sides the two su­per­pow­ers, other coun­tries such as Aus­tralia, Ja­pan and In­dia are also “nudg­ing In­done­sia to be in their or­bit”, Dr Yo­hanes said.</p>
    <p>“But I haven’t seen any­one pre­sent­ing a fait ac­com­pli, like a ‘join us or we will freeze all in­vest­ments’. In fact, it will back­fire spec­tac­u­larly as it will stoke na­tion­al­is­tic fer­vour,” he said.</p>
    <p>While China may now ex­ert more pres­sure, it will not risk ac­tions that could stoke anti-China sen­ti­ments.</p>
    <p>Next week, US Sec­re­tary of State Mike Pom­peo will travel to In­done­sia, where he is ex­pected to de­liver a speech in Jakarta and meet his coun­ter­parts to af­firm the two coun­tries’ vi­sion of a free and open Indo-Pa­cific.</p>
    <p>And so, the geopo­lit­i­cal courtship con­tin­ues, and only time will tell how it might evolve.</p>
    <p>The US may of­fer de­fence co­op­er­a­tion, par­tic­u­larly in the area of mar­itime se­cu­rity, and Boe­ing P-8 Po­sei­don mar­itime pa­trol air­craft, said Mr Siswanto.</p>
    <p>But he added: “Mr Prabowo’s US trip was a very strate­gic visit, an af­fir­ma­tion of how im­por­tant In­done­sia is in the geopol­i­tics of Un­cle Sam. But there’s no free lunch.”</p>
