    <p>Kyle You, five, and his brother Rhys, three, en­joyed vol­un­teer­ing with their par­ents at Will­ing Hearts, de­liv­er­ing meals from the char­ity to those in need.</p>
    <p>Their mother, Mrs Eve You, 37, won­dered how the boys could get more in­volved in giv­ing back rather than just fol­low­ing in­struc­tions from adults.</p>
    <p>“How do I raise kids with em­pa­thy, how do I raise kids who will not be self-en­ti­tled, how do I in­volve my kids to give back to so­ci­ety and how do I raise phil­an­thropic kids?” says Mrs You, who also has a seven-month-old daugh­ter, Thea.</p>
    <p>Af­ter ask­ing them if they wanted to help the less for­tu­nate dur­ing the Christ­mas sea­son, she gave them a project to ex­e­cute.</p>
    <p>They had to con­cep­tu­alise a fund-rais­ing idea (home­made play-dough kits with a Christ­mas theme), de­cide on the ben­e­fi­ciary, sac­ri­fice play time to cre­ate the prod­uct, and help de­liver the kits to buy­ers.</p>
    <p>The project net­ted about $200, of which 70 per cent will go to The Chil­dren’s Wish­ing Well char­ity. Most of the re­main­der will be set aside for their next project, which is likely to be char­ity movie screen­ings at their home.</p>
    <p>The boys may use a cou­ple of dol­lars to treat them­selves to an ice­cream cone from the lo­cal ice cream un­cle, as Mrs You be­lieves in the phi­los­o­phy of “do­nate, spend and save”.</p>
    <p>Kyle and Rhys have also been keep­ing their hair long, hop­ing to do­nate the locks later, af­ter see­ing their late ma­ter­nal grand­fa­ther lose his hair when he bat­tled cancer.</p>
    <p>She set up a Face­book page, Phi­lanThruKid­s (str.sg/JRQZ), to raise aware­ness of the project, and hopes it will evolve into a “cir­cle of giv­ing” that ex­tends to ef­forts from other chil­dren as well.</p>
    <p>While the term “phi­lan­thropy” is of­ten used i n as­so­ci­a­tion with wealthy in­di­vid­u­als who do­nate big sums of money, Mrs You, who used to run an on­line shop sell­ing chil­dren’s clothes and ac­ces­sories, be­lieves that even chil­dren can be phi­lan­thropists. She now helps her hus­band, Mr You Wee Wee, 37, run his biotech­nol­ogy com­pany.</p>
    <p>She hopes that the char­ity projects will teach her kids that “if you don’t have the means to do­nate, you raise funds. If you don’t have the means to raise funds, you vol­un­teer your time. En­gag­ing in char­i­ta­ble work should not be seen as some­thing ‘no­ble’. Once you find it in your heart to do it, it just be­comes a part of your life”.</p>
    <p>At the same time, she be­lieves that the ac­tiv­ity also teaches her boys about fi­nan­cial lit­er­acy as they learn to ap­por­tion money for do­na­tions and sav­ings, and set aside funds for their next project in­stead of re­ly­ing on their par­ents as bankers.</p>
    <p>They also take cal­cu­lated risks that their idea will ap­peal to po­ten­tial cus­tomers, and have to do sales pitches to grown-ups to get them on board as stake­hold­ers or buy­ers.</p>
    <p>Get­ting young chil­dren in­volved in giv­ing back is not al­ways easy, she says. There were times when her sons would take two hours to make a batch of play-dough when she could have done it in 30 min­utes her­self, or want to play in­stead of make the dough, so she would have to re­mind them of the greater cause they had com­mit­ted to.</p>
    <p>“They have to take own­er­ship of this. That’s what I hope to in­stil in them. If you say you want to help, help from the be­gin­ning right to the end.”</p>
    <p>An­other par­ent who is ac­tively in­volved in com­mu­nity work also be­lieves that giv­ing be­gins at home. Mrs Cherie Tseng, 40, says she has learnt that “kids are more ca­pa­ble of mak­ing emo­tional con­nec­tions than we give them credit for”.</p>
    <p>She re­counts an in­ci­dent where her el­dest son, Quentin, who was then five years old, saw an aban­doned bald­ing par­rot at a pet­ting farm. It re­minded him of the or­phaned chil­dren he had seen at the Myan­mar or­phan­age they had been help­ing out at, who were also bald be­cause their heads were shaved to guard against lice.</p>
    <p>“My son was re­ally pen­sive about things for a long while, then much later asked if the chil­dren at the or­phan­age were bald be­cause they were aban­doned, too, and it must make them re­ally sad, and said we needed to do some­thing to make them feel loved,” says Mrs Tseng, chief op­er­a­tions of­fi­cer at a lo­cal fin­tech com­pany. She re­cently pub­lished her third book, The Birth­day Book Jr. 20/20, which col­lected sto­ries from chil­dren about what is im­por­tant to them, so as to in­clude them in the greater con­ver­sa­tion about Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker, her chil­dren, aged three to 10, learnt about the power of many small deeds when they helped their par­ents cre­ate hun­dreds of thank you cards for mi­grant work­ers who were stuck in their dor­mi­to­ries. The project snow­balled as oth­ers got in­volved and the com­mu­nity ef­fort pro­duced over 10,000 cards.</p>
    <p>Mrs Tseng re­calls that at one point, her sons be­came tired af­ter writ­ing per­sonal notes in each card and started whinge­ing.</p>
    <p>“The boys asked why we needed to work so hard on the cards and we ex­plained that when peo­ple are feel­ing low, some­times a lit­tle jolt of pos­i­tiv­ity goes a long way,” she says. “When they were told later that some of the work­ers were so touched they teared up and stuck the card up where they were con­va­lesc­ing, I think my sons were a lit­tle sur­prised at the im­pact a sim­ple card could make, and how it could con­nect us to an­other even at such a dis­tance.”</p>
    <p>My sons were a lit­tle sur­prised at the im­pact a sim­ple card could make, and how it could con­nect us to an­other even at such a dis­tance. ’’</p>
    <p>MRS CHERIE TSENG, whose chil­dren cre­ated thank you cards for mi­grant work­ers stuck in their dor­mi­to­ries dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker. They were later told that some of the work­ers were so touched they teared up</p>
    <p>While all par­ents want their kids to be kind, it is im­por­tant to “plant the seed of be­ing char­i­ta­ble early”, says Ms Vyda S. Chai, a clin­i­cal psy­chol­o­gist with Think Psy­cho­log­i­cal Ser­vices, a pri­vate psy­cho­log­i­cal prac­tice.</p>
    <p>That starts with par­ents mod­el­ling char­i­ta­ble be­hav­iour them­selves, as chil­dren l earn from ob­serv­ing, she says.</p>
    <p>“Con­sider telling your chil­dren about some or all of the char­i­ties you sup­port, how you sup­port them, and more im­por­tantly, why you sup­port them.</p>
    <p>“Peo­ple of­ten down­play the amount of char­i­ta­ble work they do out of hu­mil­ity, but it’s im­por­tant to let our chil­dren see all of the good work you do, be it vol­un­teer­ing or do­nat­ing.”</p>
    <p>Try th­ese ac­tiv­i­ties to fos­ter the spirit of giv­ing in chil­dren of dif­fer­ent ages.</p>
    <p>IF YOU HAVE A PRE-SCHOOLER</p>
    <p>Even tod­dlers can learn about hav­ing a “char­i­ta­ble mind­set” when you en­gage them in ac­tiv­i­ties that model gen­er­ous be­hav­iour, says Ms Chai. Try shar­ing food and toys, and tak­ing turns when play­ing games. Read them books on feel­ings, both pos­i­tive and neg­a­tive.</p>
    <p>She sug­gests re­in­forc­ing em­pa­thy by ask­ing ques­tions like “Tommy didn’t get to play on the swing. How do you think he might feel? What do you think would make him happy? Why is it im­por­tant for us to share?”</p>
    <p>Mrs Eve You of Phi­lanThruKid­s says she teaches her chil­dren to be grate­ful for the peo­ple and things around them and rec­om­mends that fam­i­lies start vol­un­teer­ing every month, which can be small acts of kind­ness such as pick­ing up lit­ter at the beach to­gether.</p>
    <p>IF YOU HAVE A CHILD IN PRI­MARY SCHOOL</p>
    <p>Teach your kid to set aside a por­tion of pocket money, say 5 or 10 per cent, to do­nate to a char­ity of his or her choice, Ms Chai sug­gests. Chat with your child about how he feels when he do­nates, praise his ef­fort, no mat­ter how small the amount, and ex­plain how it will help the cause.</p>
    <p>Chil­dren at this age can also visit non-profit or­gan­i­sa­tions in the neigh­bour­hood and help, she adds. Such vis­its help chil­dren de­velop aware­ness of oth­ers and learn about their com­mu­nity.</p>
    <p>Mrs Cherie Tseng, 40, chief op­er­a­tions of­fi­cer at a lo­cal fin­tech com­pany, says that for her fam­ily, de­liv­er­ing gro­ceries to a fam­ily in need “is just us help­ing an­other fam­ily out, it’s not to teach our kids to feel ‘more blessed’ or so ‘they’d trea­sure what they have more’.</p>
    <p>“Those are never the main rea­sons why we in­clude them in our com­mu­nity projects. We give back be­cause some­one else needs help, that is all. Some­times it is re­ally that sim­ple.”</p>
    <p>IF YOU HAVE A TEENAGER</p>
    <p>En­cour­age teens to vol­un­teer within the com­mu­nity and do it with them, Ms Chai sug­gests. En­gage them in con­ver­sa­tions about how their con­tri­bu­tions help oth­ers. They can also or­gan­ise fund-rais­ers and get the whole fam­ily in­volved.</p>
