    <p>The lift­ing of en­try re­stric­tions on week­ends at Gey­lang Serai Mar­ket came into ef­fect yes­ter­day, but stall own­ers say the move has not af­fected foot­fall as ca­pac­ity caps are still in place.</p>
    <p>“It doesn’t make a dif­fer­ence. The safe dis­tanc­ing am­bas­sadors are very strict with con­trol­ling the crowd, so it’s not like more peo­ple can come into the mar­ket now,” said Mr An Rai­han, 35, who runs a sundry goods stall.</p>
    <p>The same sen­ti­ment was shared by veg­etable stall owner Haled Aidil, 59, who said that while there were still long queues to en­ter the mar­ket in the morn­ing, the in­side of the mar­ket was “very empty”.</p>
    <p>He said: “This doesn’t make much sense to me, be­cause there is no con­trol on the num­ber of peo­ple up­stairs on the sec­ond floor.”</p>
    <p>The sec­ond floor of the mar­ket is a bustling food cen­tre.</p>
    <p>Gey­lang Serai Mar­ket is one of four pop­u­lar wet mar­kets that had im­posed en­try re­stric­tions al­low­ing peo­ple to visit only on odd or even dates, de­pend­ing on the last digit of their iden­tity card num­ber.</p>
    <p>The oth­ers are Chong Pang Mar­ket at Block 104/105, Yishun Ring</p>
    <p>Road and the mar­kets at Block 20/21, Mar­sil­ing Lane and Block 505, Jurong West Street 52.</p>
    <p>The re­stric­tions were first im­ple­mented in April, but were eased for week­days from Aug 13.</p>
    <p>Start­ing yes­ter­day, week­end re­stric­tions were also eased, al­though there is a cap on the num­ber of peo­ple al­lowed in at any one time.</p>
    <p>When The Sun­day Times vis­ited Gey­lang Serai Mar­ket at 8am, long snaking queues to en­ter had formed, al­though the in­side of the mar­ket looked spa­cious enough for pa­trons to ob­serve safe dis­tanc­ing. Safe dis­tanc­ing am­bas­sadors were spot­ted all around the area to en­sure that visi­tors main­tained a 1m dis­tance from one an­other.</p>
    <p>By the lunch hour, the queues had dis­ap­peared and the crowds thinned, pos­si­bly also be­cause of the rainy weather.</p>
    <p>Fruit seller Kadariah Sham­sudin, 62, wel­comed the eas­ing of mea­sures, even if it did not ap­pear to im­me­di­ately im­prove business.</p>
    <p>She said: “I’m happy about it. It means we’re get­ting closer to re­turn­ing to a nor­mal way of life, and that’s al­ways a good thing.”</p>
    <p>Shop­pers such as Madam Neha Agar­wal, 47, agreed. She is happy that her hus­band, whose NRIC’s last digit is dif­fer­ent from hers, will</p>
    <p>now be able to join her on week­end mar­ket trips.</p>
    <p>“Fi­nally, he can help me carry my things,” said the house­wife, who vis</p>
    <p>its the mar­ket once a week.</p>
    <p>As the lift­ing of en­try re­stric­tions may mean longer queue times at the four pop­u­lar wet mar­kets, the</p>
    <p>Na­tional En­vi­ron­ment Agency on its web­site ad­vised shop­pers to visit them dur­ing week­days and non­peak hours, and to re­fer to the</p>
    <p>Space Out site to check crowd lev­els be­fore head­ing over.</p>
