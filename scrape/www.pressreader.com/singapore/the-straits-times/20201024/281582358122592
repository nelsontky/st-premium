    <p>Af­ter the dust set­tles on the United States pres­i­den­tial elec­tion, Amer­ica will need to take stock of its poli­cies in Asia, no mat­ter who wins. To con­tinue to as­sert its pres­ence in the re­gion, Pro­fes­sor Joseph Chiny­ong Liow says, the US should re­think its ap­proach on at least three ar­eas.</p>
    <p>The US pres­i­den­tial elec­tion draws to a dra­matic close. No mat­ter who wins on Nov 3, it would be pru­dent for him to take stock of Amer­i­can poli­cies in Asia.</p>
    <p>Look­ing back, for­eign pol­icy un­der Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump has been a mixed bag of hits and misses. But it’s clear that Amer­i­can standing in the world has de­clined in the past three years. Left unchecked, this will in­hibit fu­ture ef­forts to ad­vance US in­ter­ests abroad. In Asia there are at least three ar­eas the US should re­think its ap­proach if it wants to con­tinue to as­sert its pres­ence in the re­gion.</p>
    <p>1. THE CHINA CHAL­LENGE</p>
    <p>Be­cause of a shift­ing dis­tri­bu­tion of power pred­i­cated on the rise of China as a peer com­peti­tor, un­cer­tainty sur­round­ing Beijing’s in­ten­tions in the re­gion (a con­cern shared by not a few re­gional states), and Amer­i­can per­cep­tions that its le­git­i­mate in­ter­ests are be­ing un­der­mined as a con­se­quence, the US will be locked in strate­gic com­pe­ti­tion with China for the fore­see­able fu­ture no mat­ter who is in power in the White House.</p>
    <p>Yes, this hardly passes as a rev­e­la­tion but it is a point worth re­it­er­at­ing. At the same time, how­ever, as the US braces it­self to meet this chal­lenge, it should take care to avoid ac­tions that risk mak­ing an ex­is­ten­tial en­emy of a strate­gic com­peti­tor.</p>
    <p>To that end, the ques­tion has al­ways been how to bal­ance in­evitable (and grow­ing) com­pe­ti­tion with the need to fos­ter un­der­stand­ing and co­op­er­a­tion so as to head off prospects of deeper con­flict that would be in the in­ter­est of nei­ther party, and which both wish to avoid.</p>
    <p>For the United States, ef­forts to get this bal­ance right must be­gin with an aware­ness and ac­cep­tance of the fact that any at­tempt to con­tain China will be as fu­tile as it would be fool­hardy.</p>
    <p>To be sure, China’s own path to great pow­er­dom is paved with many do­mes­tic chal­lenges, and there may not be as un­equiv­o­cal a na­tional con­sen­sus on many of th­ese is­sues as Chi­nese lead­ers would like us to be­lieve.</p>
    <p>But we can­not deny that a strong sense of na­tional pride pre­vails in China, em­bold­ened and em­pow­ered by the phe­nom­e­nal progress it has made in the past three decades. Oth­er­wise known as “na­tion­al­ism”, this sen­ti­ment can be – and in­deed has been – eas­ily har­nessed, mo­bilised, and directed at per­ceived for­eign ad­ver­saries, in­clud­ing the US.</p>
    <p>The Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion has ex­pressed mis­giv­ings about un­fair trade prac­tices em­bed­ded in a Chi­nese eco­nomic model de­signed to prej­u­dice in favour of their indige­nous com­pa­nies in do­mes­tic as well as in­ter­na­tional mar­kets. Suf­fice to say, th­ese are mis­giv­ings shared by many other coun­tries.</p>
    <p>But at the same time, the US ad­min­is­tra­tion has risked toss­ing the baby out with the bath­wa­ter by pur­su­ing a patently puni­tive ap­proach and defin­ing Sino-Amer­i­can relations in over­whelm­ingly ad­ver­sar­ial terms, even as it re­mains un­clear if it has achieved its ob­jec­tives with such an ap­proach.</p>
    <p>The on­go­ing trade war serves as a case in point. When the Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion ini­ti­ated the trade war, which it later went on to es­ca­late, it was for the pur­ported ob­jec­tive of rec­ti­fy­ing the trade im­bal­ance with China and re­turn­ing Amer­i­can man­u­fac­tur­ing (ergo, jobs) back to the US.</p>
    <p>How has the US fared on both scores? Con­trari­wise, the US trade deficit with China widened from US$375.6 bil­lion in 2017 (S$509.6 bil­lion) to US$419 bil­lion in 2018, Mr Trump’s first full year in power. While this yawn­ing chasm was re­duced to US$346 bil­lion last year, it has been creep­ing up again. US gov­ern­ment data shows that year-on-year, the deficit stands at US$301,268,900 at the end of this Au­gust, com­pared to US$262,681,200 at the same time last year.</p>
    <p>Set­ting aside a chronic slow­down in Amer­i­can pro­duc­tiv­ity and low sav­ings rates which doubt­less have con­trib­uted to the deficit, the trade war has ex­acted a heavy cost on US farm­ers in the heart­land who have had to bear the brunt of Chi­nese counter-tar­iffs on Amer­i­can agri­cul­tural im­ports.</p>
    <p>Ef­forts to mit­i­gate the ef­fects of Chi­nese re­tal­ia­tory mea­sures in­volved bil­lions of dol­lars by way of gov­ern­ment sub­si­dies. This all but nul­li­fied the pur­ported ad­van­tages ac­crued from any nar­row­ing of the trade gap.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, the de­sired re­lo­ca­tion of Amer­i­can man­u­fac­tur­ing back to the US from China has not hap­pened ei­ther. In­stead, to the ex­tent that sup­ply chains have re­lo­cated, many US com­pa­nies have taken their in­vest­ments and jobs else­where.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to the Kear­ney Reshoring Index, of US$31 bil­lion in US im­ports that shifted out of China in the se­cond quar­ter of 2019, 46 per cent was ab­sorbed by Viet­nam alone. Mex­ico, the “China of the Amer­i­cas”, has been an­other favourite des­ti­na­tion for US man­u­fac­tur­ers who have left China.</p>
    <p>Con­comi­tantly, de­spite be­ing on the re­ceiv­ing end of harsh Trumpian rhetoric, Mex­i­can man­u­fac­tur­ing ex­ports to the US in­creased by 10 per cent be­tween 2017 and 2018, and 4 per cent be­tween 2018 and 2019. Sim­ply put, as far as eco­nomic pol­icy is con­cerned, un­der the Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion the US has cut off its nose to spite its face when it pur­sued naked mer­can­til­ism.</p>
    <p>A new ad­min­is­tra­tion would do well to un­der­take a clear-eyed re­assess­ment of this ap­proach. With a phase one Sino-US trade agree­ment al­ready in place, phase two should be more com­pre­hen­sive and strate­gi­cally cal­i­brated. It must set aside the nar­row and ill-in­formed ob­ses­sion with the trade deficit, which at any rate is a poor bell­wether of the health of an econ­omy.</p>
    <p>Rather, it should fo­cus on ad­dress­ing is­sues such as com­pli­ance with World Trade Or­gan­i­sa­tion (WTO) com­mit­ments, reg­u­la­tion of im­por­tant ar­eas not cov­ered by the WTO, like state-owned en­ter­prises and the digital econ­omy, in­clu­sion of some form of an ar­bi­tra­tion mech­a­nism, and it should bake in el­e­ments of a bi­lat­eral in­vest­ment treaty.</p>
    <p>Crit­ics will no doubt ar­gue that this is a tall or­der. Per­haps so. But given the dis­rup­tion that the trade war has caused, there is now an op­por­tu­nity to at least at­tempt the es­tab­lish­ment of a more ro­bust foun­da­tion to prop­erly man­age the in­ex­tri­ca­ble in­ter­de­pen­dence of the two colos­sal economies.</p>
    <p>2. RE­TURN TO MULTILATER­ALISM</p>
    <p>Some ob­servers have er­ro­neously dis­missed the Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion as iso­la­tion­ist.</p>
    <p>It is not, as its ef­forts to move the dial in the Mid­dle East and the Korean penin­sula have shown, even if in the lat­ter case it has so far been a fail­ure.</p>
    <p>Like­wise, it is not en­tirely cor­rect to say that the Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion has aban­doned multilater­alism, even if its pre­ferred mode of diplo­matic en­gage­ment is, in­deed, bi­lat­eral.</p>
    <p>In the Indo-Pa­cific re­gion, the ad­min­is­tra­tion rein­vig­o­rated the Quad, an in­for­mal plat­form that has brought to­gether the US, Aus­tralia, Ja­pan and In­dia to aug­ment se­cu­rity re­la­tion­ships among the four mem­bers. A new ad­min­is­tra­tion should sus­tain, if not en­hance, this ini­tia­tive.</p>
    <p>Where the US did step back from multilater­alism is in the realm of trade, and the Amer­i­can peo­ple have been (fig­u­ra­tively and lit­er­ally) poorer for it.</p>
    <p>Apro­pos the Sino-US trade war, Amer­ica’s with­drawal from the Trans Pa­cific Part­ner­ship (TPP) was a missed op­por­tu­nity to strengthen its econ­omy, ad­dress the eco­nomic chal­lenge from China, and pro­vide re­gional lead­er­ship.</p>
    <p>As al­ter­nate uni­verses go, the</p>
    <p>TPP would have been an Amer­i­can-led ef­fort to ad­vance and deepen co­op­er­a­tion on re­gional trade by es­tab­lish­ing uni­ver­sal rules, in­clud­ing strong pro­vi­sions to ad­dress pro­tec­tion­ism and in­tel­lec­tual prop­erty con­cerns.</p>
    <p>In turn, this would have served as a com­pelling mech­a­nism to ef­fect some change in Chi­nese eco­nomic poli­cies and prac­tices by dint of not only pro­vid­ing a very vi­able al­ter­na­tive to what China has to of­fer the re­gion, but also for the fact that many of Beijing’s ma­jor re­gional trad­ing part­ners would have been in­cluded in it.</p>
    <p>Of course, this is not to say that the US will re­turn to the TPP, now known as the CPTPP (Com­pre­hen­sive and Pro­gres­sive Agree­ment for Trans-Pa­cific Part­ner­ship), any­time soon.</p>
    <p>While that is de­sir­able, the po­lit­i­cal costs of such a quick U-turn will be too high. Nev­er­the­less, the US should re­alise that a strong com­mit­ment to mul­ti­lat­eral free trade to ac­com­pany a com­pre­hen­sive bi­lat­eral trade agree­ment with China as sug­gested ear­lier will af­ford it strong points of lever­age go­ing for­ward.</p>
    <p>Not only that, but a re­set of its ap­proach to re­gional trade will also ben­e­fit Amer­i­can farm­ers, pro­duc­ers and con­sumers, for the longer-term ben­e­fits to the US econ­omy will far out­weigh short-term chal­lenges.</p>
    <p>But the harsh re­al­ity is that seiz­ing this op­por­tu­nity will re­quire the po­lit­i­cal will and com­mit­ment to look above the para­pet of nar­row, short-term po­lit­i­cal in­ter­ests.</p>
    <p>3. CONSISTENC­Y AND COHERENCE</p>
    <p>This leads us to the fi­nal point, which is the need to have and to ar­tic­u­late co­her­ent nar­ra­tives and con­sis­tent poli­cies.</p>
    <p>There should be no doubt that most re­gional states place a pre­mium on grounded and pre­dictable US en­gage­ment in re­gional af­fairs.</p>
    <p>By that mea­sure, the hap­haz­ard in­con­sis­ten­cies in US for­eign pol­icy words and deeds over the past few years have oc­ca­sioned a de­gree of un­pre­dictabil­ity that has called into ques­tion Amer­i­can re­li­a­bil­ity.</p>
    <p>In terms of pol­icy pro­nounce­ments, Mr Trump and his se­nior of­fi­cials have spo­ken at cross pur­poses all too of­ten.</p>
    <p>What’s more, the Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion has also of­ten pur­sued poli­cies that are at odds with the lofty declara­tory strate­gic goals enun­ci­ated in its car­di­nal doc­u­ments. For in­stance, while the ad­min­is­tra­tion’s na­tional se­cu­rity doc­u­ments li­onise the im­por­tance of al­lies and part­ners, the pres­i­dent has per­sis­tently threat­ened to with­draw the US from Nato and the Korean penin­sula. All this has left friends and al­lies guess­ing as to Amer­i­can in­tent and com­mit­ment.</p>
    <p>Th­ese in­con­sis­ten­cies speak to a deeper con­tra­dic­tion in cur­rent US pol­icy in Asia, which sees the Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion’s de­sire to cor­ral re­gional states to align their views on China runs up against its own uni­lat­er­al­ist im­pulses.</p>
    <p>Need­less to say, the un­cer­tain­ties have not been helped by the tu­mul­tuous hu­man re­source sit­u­a­tion in the Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion ei­ther, with its no­to­ri­ous record of res­ig­na­tions and dis­missals, not to men­tion nu­mer­ous diplo­matic po­si­tions left un­filled par­tic­u­larly in South-east Asia.</p>
    <p>To be sure, no mat­ter who oc­cu­pies the White House af­ter</p>
    <p>Jan 20 next year, storm clouds would have gath­ered over the US.</p>
    <p>Faced with a po­lit­i­cally hy­per-po­larised home front, the pres­sure will be to fo­cus on fix­ing ur­gent wrench­ing prob­lems at home at the ex­pense of what is hap­pen­ing be­yond US bor­ders.</p>
    <p>But as a great power, the US can­not af­ford to lose sight of the long game on for­eign pol­icy.</p>
    <p>Lest our Amer­i­can friends for­get, since De­cem­ber 1941, when it en­tered World War II, the US has pre­vailed over all and sundry and emerged a global su­per­power on the back of not only a strong mil­i­tary and a ro­bust, in­no­va­tive econ­omy, but also the prac­tice of Amer­i­can diplo­macy in all its re­solve and as­sid­u­ous­ness. Fast-for­ward 80 years, this re­mains as im­por­tant as ever.</p>
