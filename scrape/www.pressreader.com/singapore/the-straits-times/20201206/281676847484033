    <p>WASH­ING­TON • The World Health Or­gan­i­sa­tion (WHO) has warned that vac­cines will be no magic bul­let for the coro­n­avirus cri­sis as na­tions gear up for a mas­sive roll-out to tackle surg­ing in­fec­tions.</p>
    <p>The word of cau­tion comes as the United States clocked a record num­ber of Covid-19 cases for a se­cond day in a row, with the coun­try pre­par­ing for what US Pres­i­dent-elect Joe Bi­den calls a “dark win­ter”.</p>
    <p>Amer­ica’s Cen­tres for Dis­ease Con­trol and Preven­tion on Fri­day rec­om­mended “univer­sal face mask use” in­doors, and Mr Bi­den</p>
    <p>NO MAGIC BUL­LET</p>
    <p>said he would scale down his January in­au­gu­ra­tion cer­e­mony to mit­i­gate the virus risk.</p>
    <p>This comes as coun­tries pre­pare for the ap­proval and roll-out of sev­eral vac­cines that have proven ef­fec­tive in tri­als.</p>
    <p>The WHO, how­ever, warned against vac­cine com­pla­cency and what it said was an er­ro­neous be­lief that the Covid-19 cri­sis is over with jabs on the hori­zon.</p>
    <p>“Vac­cines do not equal zero Covid,” said WHO emer­gen­cies direc­tor Michael Ryan, ad­ding that not ev­ery­one will be able to re­ceive it early next year.</p>
    <p>“Vac­ci­na­tion will add a ma­jor, ma­jor, pow­er­ful tool to the tool kit that we have. But by them­selves, they will not do the job.”</p>
    <p>WHO direc­tor-gen­eral Te­dros Ad­hanom Ghe­breye­sus said progress on vac­cines sig­nalled “light at the end of the tun­nel”. But he warned against the “grow­ing per­cep­tion that the pan­demic is over”, with the virus still spread­ing fast, putting enor­mous pres­sure on hos­pi­tals.</p>
    <p>The WHO says 51 can­di­date vac­cines are cur­rently be­ing tested on hu­mans, with 13 reach­ing fi­nal­stage mass test­ing.</p>
    <p>Bri­tain last Wed­nes­day be­came the first Western coun­try to ap­prove an in­oc­u­la­tion, from Pfiz­erBioNTech, for gen­eral use.</p>
    <p>Bri­tish med­i­cal chiefs said the ar­rival of the vac­cine from this week should see deaths re­duce “sig­nif­i­cantly” by early next year, but warned that so­cial mix­ing over Christ­mas could cause an­other spike be­fore then. “By spring, the ef­fects of vac­ci­na­tion will be­gin to be felt in re­duc­ing Covid ad­mis­sions, at­ten­dances and deaths sig­nif­i­cantly but there are many weeks be­fore we get to that stage.”</p>
    <p>Italy is see­ing a dra­matic resur­gence of in­fec­tions af­ter it largely tamped down an ear­lier out­break by en­forc­ing a strict lock­down, while Latin Amer­ica and the Caribbean have seen an 18 per cent spike in cases in a week.</p>
    <p>Other na­tions are un­veil­ing hol­i­day re­stric­tions, with Switzer­land ban­ning Christ­mas car­olling in the streets and Madrid can­celling most New Year events in the city cen­tre.</p>
    <p>Vac­cines do not equal zero Covid. Vac­ci­na­tion will add a ma­jor, ma­jor, pow­er­ful tool to the tool kit that we have. But by them­selves, they will not do the job.</p>
