    <p>Cap­i­taLand’s wholly owned lodg­ing busi­ness unit, The Ascott, is adding over 1,000 units across six new prop­er­ties in Aus­tralia, China and the Philip­pines, un­der its co­l­iv­ing brand lyf.</p>
    <p>With the ad­di­tions, Ascott will have a to­tal of 14 lyf prop­er­ties with over 2,700 units, the com­pany said yes­ter­day. Thir­teen of these prop­er­ties are slated to open be­tween this year and 2024.</p>
    <p>Among the six new prop­er­ties, Ascott has bagged con­tracts for lyf Malate Manila, its sec­ond lyf prop­erty in the Philip­pines, as well as four new lyf prop­er­ties across China – lyf Shougang Park Bei­jing, lyf Mid­town Hangzhou, lyf Zhangjiang Shang­hai, and lyf Dayanta Xi’an. It has also se­cured its first lyf prop­erty in Aus­tralia, called lyf Colling­wood Mel­bourne.</p>
    <p>Ascott is set to open its first lyf prop­erty in Bangkok, Thai­land to­day. This comes after it opened lyf Fu­nan Sin­ga­pore last Septem­ber, which was tar­geted at mil­len­ni­als.</p>
    <p>The 196-unit lyf Sukhumvit 8 Bangkok is within walk­ing dis­tance of the Nana BTS Sky­train sta­tion and one train stop from the Ter­mi­nal 21 shop­ping des­ti­na­tion. It is also three BTS sta­tions away from Siam, the Thai cap­i­tal’s main life­style hub for re­tail, din­ing and co-work­ing.</p>
    <p>Mr Kevin Goh, Ascott’s chief ex­ec­u­tive of­fi­cer and Cap­i­taLand’s CEO for lodg­ing, said Ascott’s port­fo­lio con­tin­ues to be sup­ported by a “strong base” of long-stay guests com­pris­ing lo­cals, ex­pa­tri­ates and cor­po­rates, de­spite the coro­n­avirus out­break and chal­lenges in the global hospi­tal­ity in­dus­try.</p>
    <p>“lyf is a hy­brid lodg­ing so­lu­tion that com­bines the best of ser­viced res­i­dences, ho­tels and co-liv­ing apart­ments. It is de­signed for guests on long stay with the flex­i­bil­ity to take in short stay,” he said.</p>
    <p>“The value and de­mand for lyf is ev­i­dent in the per­for­mance of our first op­er­at­ing lyf prop­erty, lyf Fu­nan Sin­ga­pore, where guests could stay with us safely and com­fort­ably through­out the Covid-19 pe­riod,” Mr Goh said, adding that the Fu­nan out­let achieved an av­er­age oc­cu­pancy rate of 86 per cent from April to last month.</p>
    <p>Head of lyf Joel Oei said the brand took its com­mu­nity en­gage­ment ac­tiv­i­ties on­line and con­ducted vir­tual tours and dig­i­tal­first mar­ket­ing cam­paigns to ex­pand its reach amid the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Ascott is look­ing for more op­por­tu­ni­ties to in­tro­duce lyf to key gate­way cities in France, Ger­many, In­done­sia, the Nether­lands, South Korea, Viet­nam and the United King­dom.</p>
