    <p>Five years ago, para archer Nur Syahi­dah Alim burst onto the scene with gold medals in the in­di­vid­ual com­pound and mixed team in her first com­pet­i­tive out­ing at the Asean Para Games (APG).</p>
    <p>Her ca­reer has seen a me­te­oric rise since, with her big­gest achieve­ment com­ing in a “break­through year” last year when the 34-yearold won a his­toric gold medal at the World Archery Para Cham­pi­onships in the Nether­lands.</p>
    <p>Not only did it earn Sin­ga­pore a spot at the Tokyo Par­a­lympics, but her world ti­tle also helped pro­pel her to the top of the world rank­ings.</p>
    <p>To cap off the ster­ling year, the world No. 1 para archer was yes­ter­day crowned Sportswoma­n of the Year at the Sin­ga­pore Dis­abil­ity Sports Awards (SDSA) pre­sented by Haw Par Cor­po­ra­tion.</p>
    <p>She emerged the win­ner among a strong field that com­prised Par­a­lympic medal­lists Yip Pin Xiu (swim­ming) and Lau­ren­tia Tan (eques­trian), Diane Neo (bowl­ing), Nur Aini Mo­hamad Yasli (pow­er­lift­ing), Nu­ru­lasy­iqah Mohammad Taha (boc­cia) and Claire Toh (ta­ble ten­nis).</p>
    <p>Syahi­dah, a first-time re­cip­i­ent, said: “This award shows how much my team and I have achieved in the year.</p>
    <p>“This will re­ally give me motivation to do even bet­ter and achieve more mile­stones for Sin­ga­pore in the years to come.”</p>
    <p>One of those mile­stones could be reached at next year’s Par­a­lympics, where she is tar­get­ing Sin­ga­pore’s first-ever medal in the sport.</p>
    <p>While Syahi­dah, who reached the quar­ter-fi­nals in Rio 2016, will have to wait an­other year to com­pete at the Aug 24-Sept 5 Tokyo Games next year af­ter it was post­poned ow­ing to Covid-19, she is tak­ing the ex­tra time in her stride.</p>
    <p>“It gives ev­ery­one a fair play­ing field to pre­pare for the Games and at the same time, there’s that peace of mind that we are com­pet­ing in a safe en­vi­ron­ment,” said the ath­lete, who has cere­bral palsy.</p>
    <p>“With the time given to us, it’s an op­por­tu­nity to pre­pare as much as pos­si­ble for the Games.”</p>
    <p>Bowler Eric Foo, 32, was named the Sports­man of the Year af­ter a fruit­ful sea­son that saw him bag two gold medals (mixed sin­gles TPB4 and mixed dou­bles TPB4) and a sil­ver (all events mixed TPB4) at the Thai­land leg of the World</p>
    <p>Para Bowl­ing Tour Series last year.</p>
    <p>He also claimed t wo golds (men’s sin­gles TPB4 and men’s all events TPB4) and one bronze (men’s dou­bles TPB4) at the Philip­pines leg of the series last year.</p>
    <p>Foo, who has an in­tel­lec­tual im­pair­ment, also bagged the Team of the Year award with Muham­mad Farhan Is­mail. The duo won the mixed dou­bles and men’s dou­bles events at the series in Thai­land and Philip­pines re­spec­tively.</p>
    <p>Af­ter miss­ing out on the APG this year, which was post­poned twice be­fore it was can­celled ow­ing to the pan­demic, Foo is gun­ning for hon­ours in next year’s Games in Viet­nam.</p>
    <p>He said: “We have trained quite hard and at least we won the two gold medals in Thai­land and then in the Philip­pines. We were hop­ing that these Games won’t be can­celled, but we will con­tinue to train hard for the next Games.”</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day’s vir­tual awards cer­e­mony also saw swim­mer Toh Wei Soong pick­ing up the Sports­boy of the Year ac­co­lade for the sec­ond year run­ning for his achieve­ments at the World Para Swim­ming World Series and Ja­pan Para Swim­ming Cham­pi­onships last year.</p>
    <p>Nine win­ners were hon­oured at yes­ter­day’s cer­e­mony. Min­is­ter for Cul­ture, Com­mu­nity and Youth Ed­win Tong, who was the guest of hon­our, lauded the ath­letes for con­tin­u­ing to “train hard un­der ex­tra­or­di­nary cir­cum­stances” de­spite the can­cel­la­tion of the APG and post­pone­ment of the Par­a­lympics.</p>
    <p>“To our ath­letes, we hope you stay mo­ti­vated and en­cour­aged. As you re­sume train­ing and gear up to­wards the next com­pe­ti­tion, you can be sure that we will cheer you on as One Team Sin­ga­pore.”</p>

        <p data-role="text">Para archer Nur Syahi&#xAD;dah Alim had a break&#xAD;through year when she won a his&#xAD;toric gold medal at the 2019 World Archery Para Cham&#xAD;pi&#xAD;onships in the Nether&#xAD;lands. Para bowler Eric Foo also had a good 2019, win&#xAD;ning two golds each at the Thai&#xAD;land and Philip&#xAD;pines legs of the World Para Bowl&#xAD;ing Tour Series.</p>
