    <p>Rap­per Kanye West (left) will ap­pear on the up­com­ing United States pres­i­den­tial election bal­lot in eight states, ac­cord­ing to a re­port by busi­ness mag­a­zine Forbes.</p>
    <p>Pre­vi­ously a sup­porter of US Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump, the 43-year-old star will be on the bal­lot for the states of Idaho, Min­nesota, Ten­nessee, Iowa, Arkansas, Colorado, Ok­la­homa and Ver­mont.</p>
    <p>Idaho’s deputy sec­re­tary of state Ja­son Han­cock said on Tues­day that West had turned in 1,022 ver­i­fied sig­na­tures, meet­ing the state’s min­i­mum re­quire­ment of 1,000 sig­na­tures.</p>
    <p>West also re­ceived more than the 275 sig­na­tures needed to ap­pear on the Ten­nessee bal­lot.</p>
    <p>Can­di­date fil­ing data from Min­nesota shows West will be on the bal­lot there with vice-pres­i­den­tial run­ning mate Michelle Tid­ball, a preacher from Wy­oming.</p>
    <p>West failed to qual­ify to run in Wy­oming and other states such as Mis­souri, Ohio, Illi­nois, Wis­con­sin, West Vir­ginia and Mon­tana, as he missed the dead­line to file nom­i­na­tion pa­pers in th­ese states.</p>
    <p>With the eight states where he is on the bal­lot, it would be im­pos­si­ble for him to earn the 270 elec­toral votes needed for a suc­cess­ful pres­i­den­tial bid.</p>
    <p>West, a con­tro­ver­sial mu­si­cian who has made pub­lic his strug­gles with bipo­lar dis­or­der, first an­nounced his bid for the pres­i­dency on Twit­ter last month.</p>
    <p>He held his first rally later that month in Charleston, South Carolina, as a can­di­date for the Birth­day Party – a po­lit­i­cal party he cre­ated.</p>
    <p>The rally sparked wide­spread con­cern about West’s men­tal health, as he broke down cry­ing while talk­ing about abor­tion, seem­ingly ad­mit­ting that he had orig­i­nally wanted his wife, re­al­i­tytele­vi­sion star Kim Kar­dashian, to abort their first child North, who is now seven.</p>
    <p>He then went on a ram­bling mono­logue about 19th-cen­tury abo­li­tion­ist Har­riet Tub­man.</p>
    <p>West and Kar­dashian, who mar­ried in 2014, have four chil­dren.</p>
