    <p>Are co-cur­ric­u­lar ac­tiv­i­ties (CCAs) a big part of JC life?</p>
    <p>CCAs are an in­te­gral part of a stu­dent’s holis­tic de­vel­op­ment, help­ing him or her learn core val­ues, so­cial and emotional com­pe­ten­cies and emerg­ing 21st-cen­tury com­pe­ten­cies. Through CCAs, stu­dents dis­cover their pas­sion and tal­ents.</p>
    <p>As they pre­pare for a world where soft skills like col­lab­o­ra­tion and flex­i­ble think­ing are val­ued, CCAs are a way to cul­ti­vate and demon­strate these skills in an au­then­tic and en­joy­able way.</p>
    <p>CCAs em­pha­sise so­cial in­ter­ac­tion by pro­vid­ing a com­mon space for friend­ships and so­cial in­te­gra­tion among stu­dents of di­verse back­grounds, al­low­ing them to foster a bet­ter un­der­stand­ing of their peers and strength­en­ing school spirit. In ad­di­tion, CCAs can pro­vide stu­dents op­por­tu­ni­ties to serve the com­mu­nity through group val­ues in ac­tion ac­tiv­i­ties.</p>
    <p>Should my child go to an In­te­grated Pro­gramme (IP) JC?</p>
    <p>The de­ci­sion of which JC to en­rol in should be made with the child’s in­ter­ests and strengths in mind, tak­ing into con­sid­er­a­tion what each JC has to of­fer that suits the learn­ing needs of the child.</p>
    <p>IP JCs work closely with their part­ner sec­ondary schools to de­sign their cur­ricu­lum and pro­grammes, tak­ing into ac­count those of their part­ner sec­ondary school and how to ex­tend stu­dents’ learn­ing in JC. In ad­di­tion, more col­lab­o­ra­tive ap­proaches are adopted in teach­ing to suit the learn­ing needs of the stu­dents.</p>
    <p>All JCs of­fer a col­lab­o­ra­tive learn­ing en­vi­ron­ment for stu­dents who en­joy work­ing in teams and a wide range of ex­pe­ri­ences to stretch their abil­i­ties, while pre­par­ing them for the A lev­els or IBDP.</p>
    <p>How has JC ed­u­ca­tion evolved over the years?</p>
    <p>The per­cep­tion that a JC ed­u­ca­tion is more the­o­ret­i­cal is less true to­day, with cur­ricu­lum, ped­a­gogy and as­sess­ment in JCs push­ing stu­dents to see the prac­ti­cal ap­pli­ca­tion of the knowl­edge they ac­quire.</p>
    <p>Spe­cial pro­grammes such as in­tern­ships, re­search at­tach­ments and con­fer­ences like Model United Na­tions and other aca­demic sym­posia have been in­tro­duced to pro­vide more op­por­tu­ni­ties for stu­dents to ex­tend their learn­ing in a real-world con­text.</p>
    <p>A-level ex­am­i­na­tion ques­tions also in­creas­ingly present more real-world sce­nar­ios that stu­dents need to crit­i­cally ex­am­ine in or­der to ap­ply rel­e­vant knowl­edge and con­cepts.</p>
    <p>JCs to­day have an even greater fo­cus on ed­u­ca­tion and ca­reer guid­ance, char­ac­ter and ci­ti­zen­ship ed­u­ca­tion, and lead­er­ship de­vel­op­ment.</p>
    <p>We are pre­par­ing stu­dents not just for univer­sity ed­u­ca­tion, but also equip­ping them with the skills for life­long learn­ing and adapt­ing to the dif­fer­ent roles they will take on in their fu­ture ca­reers.</p>
