    <p>The Sin­ga­pore Chi­nese Cham­ber of Com­merce and In­dus­try (SCCCI) helped more than 680 firms ven­ture into China in the first half of this year, an in­di­ca­tion of the role trade as­so­ci­a­tions and cham­bers play in grow­ing com­pa­nies here.</p>
    <p>As an im­por­tant bridge be­tween the Gov­ern­ment and firms, these or­gan­i­sa­tions also help com­pa­nies over­come crises, said Min­is­ter of State for Trade and In­dus­try Low Yen Ling at an an­nual con­fer­ence or­gan­ised by the SCCCI yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Pre­lim­i­nary find­ings from the cham­ber’s an­nual busi­ness sur­vey, which was shared at the con­fer­ence, showed that 80 per cent of its 1,020 mem­bers have seen a fall in rev­enue.</p>
    <p>In the sur­vey, which was con­ducted in June and last month, three in four said their profit mar­gin has de­clined.</p>
    <p>Al­most all the re­spon­dents were small and medium-sized en­ter­prises (SMEs).</p>
    <p>In her speech at the con­fer­ence, which was held vir­tu­ally, Ms Low high­lighted how Sin­ga­pore had over­come past chal­lenges, such as the 1997 Asian fi­nan­cial cri­sis, the se­vere acute res­pi­ra­tory syn­drome (Sars) out­break in 2003, and the global fi­nan­cial cri­sis in 2008.</p>
    <p>She said: “Be­cause of the close col­lab­o­ra­tion be­tween the Gov­ern­ment and trade as­so­ci­a­tions and cham­bers, our com­pa­nies have been able to over­come chal­lenges time and again, and emerged stronger from each cri­sis.”</p>
    <p>Firms can lever­age gov­ern­ment pro­grammes such as the Grow Dig­i­tal ini­tia­tive, which helps busi­nesses ex­pand by sell­ing their prod­ucts on­line to over­seas mar­kets.</p>
    <p>There is also the GoBusi­ness Gov As­sist por­tal, which helps SMEs navigate gov­ern­ment sup­port schemes, Ms Low said.</p>
    <p>In his speech, SCCCI pres­i­dent Roland Ng high­lighted some of the chal­lenges firms are cur­rently fac­ing. They in­clude fi­nanc­ing and cash flow, ris­ing busi­ness costs, and the un­cer­tain eco­nomic and po­lit­i­cal con­di­tions over­seas.</p>
    <p>De­spite this, 70 per cent of the firms sur­veyed said that they have main­tained their staff strength, with just 8 per cent of com­pa­nies hav­ing had to lay off work­ers.</p>
    <p>Com­pa­nies ex­pect that re­cov­ery will be pro­tracted, with about 60 per cent of those sur­veyed in­di­cat­ing that busi­ness will re­cover to pre-Covid-19 lev­els in one to two years, Mr Ng said.</p>
    <p>He noted that amid the pan­demic, firms have iden­ti­fied new rev­enue sources, sped up their adop­tion of dig­i­tal­i­sa­tion pro­cesses, and in­tro­duced in­no­va­tive prod­ucts and ser­vices to grow their rev­enue.</p>
    <p>“For busi­nesses, be­yond sur­vival and over­com­ing their im­me­di­ate chal­lenges... com­pa­nies must con­tinue with the mo­men­tum to trans­form, in­no­vate and up­grade their ca­pa­bil­i­ties,” said Mr Ng.</p>
    <p>Com­pa­nies ex­pect that re­cov­ery will be pro­tracted, with about 60 per cent of those sur­veyed in­di­cat­ing that busi­ness will re­cover to pre-Covid-19 lev­els in one to two years.</p>
