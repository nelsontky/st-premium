    <p>Lyena (not her real name) was kept on the phone for two hours by a scam­mer pos­ing as a Mi­crosoft tech­ni­cal sup­port em­ployee, dur­ing which he man­aged to ob­tain her bank ac­count de­tails and ar­range a trans­fer of $35,000 out of the ac­count.</p>
    <p>It was a trau­matic ex­pe­ri­ence for the 60-year-old ed­u­ca­tor, even though the money was even­tu­ally re­cov­ered, thanks to quick ac­tion by the po­lice.</p>
    <p>Speak­ing to re­porters in a phone in­ter­view yes­ter­day, Lyena said she saw a pop-up mes­sage on her com­puter on May 28, say­ing her com­puter was “at risk” and that she had to seek help im­me­di­ately.</p>
    <p>As her com­puter’s anti-virus soft­ware had just ex­pired then, Lyena pan­icked at the thought that her com­puter had been in­fected by a virus and called the num­ber pro­vided in the pop-up mes­sage.</p>
    <p>“The man who picked up the phone in­tro­duced him­self as a Mi­crosoft em­ployee and he sounded very pro­fes­sional,” Lyena said. “He asked me to in­stall Ul­traViewer, an ap­pli­ca­tion that would give him re­mote ac­cess to my com­puter, so he could find out what the prob­lem was.”</p>
    <p>The scam­mer used fab­ri­cated photos to con­vince Lyena that her com­puter had been hacked by eight peo­ple, and per­suaded her to re­veal her bank ac­count de­tails on the pre­text of pro­tect­ing her from the hack­ers.</p>
    <p>Lyena re­ceived a call from her bank the next morn­ing in­form­ing her that $35,000 had been trans­ferred out of her ac­count into an­other bank ac­count. It was only then that she re­alised that she had been scammed. She made a po­lice re­port im­me­di­ately.</p>
    <p>She is grate­ful that the po­lice acted swiftly and were able to re­cover $33,000 in three days and the re­main­ing $2,000 soon af­ter. “I would never have thought that I would be­come a vic­tim of a scam. It was a re­ally trau­matic ex­pe­ri­ence. I’ve since in­stalled anti-virus soft­ware in both my phone and com­puter,” she said.</p>
    <p>Com­mer­cial Af­fairs De­part­ment se­nior in­ves­ti­ga­tion of­fi­cer Alan Kit said that when Lyena filed the re­port, the po­lice im­me­di­ately con­tacted the banks to freeze the ac­counts. “We got hold of the par­tic­u­lars of the ben­e­fi­ciary who had re­ceived $35,000 from Lyena’s bank ac­count. My col­league and I went down to his ad­dress im­me­di­ately and were able to re­cover $33,000 in cash,” Mr Kit said.</p>
    <p>The re­main­ing $2,000 had been frozen in the ben­e­fi­ciary’s bank ac­count and the po­lice got a court or­der for it to be re­turned to Lyena.</p>
    <p>Mr Kit said the scam­mers had con­tacted the ben­e­fi­ciary, a busi­ness­man, and given the ex­cuse of buy­ing sur­gi­cal gloves from him in or­der to de­posit $35,000 into his bank ac­count. The ben­e­fi­ciary had with­drawn $33,000 to pay his glove</p>
    <p>sup­plier and had no idea that the money was from a scam vic­tim.</p>
    <p>In the first half of this year, there were 317 cases of tech sup­port scams re­ported to the po­lice, more than 10 times the 30 cases in the same pe­riod last year. Vic­tims lost a to­tal of $15 mil­lion, up from $340,000 in the same pe­riod last year.</p>
    <p>That makes tech sup­port scams the sec­ond costli­est kind of scams here af­ter in­vest­ment scams, in which vic­tims lost $22.3 mil­lion.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, the largest amount cheated in a sin­gle scam case in the first half of this year was $958,000.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, the po­lice said 261 sus­pected scam­mers and money mules are un­der probe, fol­low­ing a two-week-long is­land­wide en­force­ment op­er­a­tion. The sus­pects are be­lieved to be in­volved in more than 500 cases of scams, in­volv­ing sums ex­ceed­ing $3 mil­lion.</p>
    <p>Mr Kit said cases in­volv­ing scam­mers pos­ing as tech sup­port staff are on the rise now that many peo­ple are work­ing from home. He ad­vised the pub­lic not to follow in­struc­tions to in­stall ap­pli­ca­tions, type com­mands into the com­puter or log in to on­line bank­ing ac­counts. “All in­com­ing in­ter­na­tional calls are pre­fixed with a plus sign and the pub­lic should be wary when re­ceiv­ing un­so­licited calls from over­seas.”</p>
    <p>UN­SUS­PECT­ING VIC­TIM</p>
    <p>I would never have thought that I would be­come a vic­tim of a scam. It was a re­ally trau­matic ex­pe­ri­ence. I’ve since in­stalled anti-virus soft­ware in both my phone and ’’ com­puter.</p>
    <p>LYENA, who re­sponded to a pop-up mes­sage on her com­puter on May 28, say­ing her com­puter was “at risk” and that she had to seek help im­me­di­ately.</p>
