    <p>WASHINGTON Twit­ter on Tues­day said it had sus­pended a num­ber of ac­counts that claimed to be owned by black sup­port­ers of US Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump and his re-election cam­paign, say­ing the ac­counts broke its rules on spam and plat­form ma­nip­u­la­tion.</p>
    <p>“Our teams are work­ing dili­gently to in­ves­ti­gate this ac­tiv­ity and will take ac­tion in line with the Twit­ter rules if tweets are found to be in vi­o­la­tion,” a spokesman said.</p>
    <p>A Reuters re­view of some of the sus­pended ac­counts showed they of­ten used im­ages of real peo­ple that did not match their names and posted iden­ti­cal lan­guage in their mes­sages, in­clud­ing the phrase: “YES IM BLACK AND IM VOT­ING FOR TRUMP!!!”</p>
    <p>The ac­counts some­times claimed to be owned by mil­i­tary vet­er­ans or mem­bers of law en­force­ment.</p>
    <p>As­so­ciate Pro­fes­sor Dar­ren Linvill, a so­cial me­dia dis­in­for­ma­tion re­searcher at Clemson Univer­sity who said he had been track­ing the ac­counts since last Satur­day, found more than two dozen that col­lec­tively had 265,000 retweets or Twit­ter men­tions.</p>
    <p>The ac­counts ranged in size but some had tens of thou­sands of fol­low­ers, he said.</p>
    <p>Twit­ter de­clined to spec­ify the num­ber of ac­counts sus­pended or to com­ment be­yond its state­ment.</p>
    <p>The com­pany’s pol­icy against plat­form ma­nip­u­la­tion and spam bans co­or­di­na­tion among ac­counts to ar­ti­fi­cially influence con­ver­sa­tion, in­clud­ing the use of mul­ti­ple or fake ac­counts.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to Prof Linvill, some of the ac­counts used pho­tos of black Amer­i­can men that had ap­peared in news ar­ti­cles. Some used iden­ti­cal im­ages of Mr Trump as their header im­age.</p>
    <p>Prof Linvill also said most of the ac­counts were cre­ated in 2017, but had be­come more ac­tive in the past two months. All the ac­counts he was track­ing in the group had now been sus­pended, but the dam­age was al­ready done, he said.</p>
    <p>“It doesn’t mat­ter if Twit­ter’s shut­ting you down in four days, they’ve al­ready had their im­pact,” Prof Linvill said.</p>
