    <p>Sin­ga­pore shares sank yes­ter­day, track­ing the Wall Street rout overnight amid fears in the United States of a sec­ond wave of the coronaviru­s, stalled stim­u­lus talks and an in­creas­ingly con­tentious pres­i­den­tial elec­tion campaign.</p>
    <p>Mr Stephen Innes, chief global mar­ket strate­gist at Ax­iCorp, said: “Fad­ing prospects for US fis­cal stim­u­lus and the step­ping up of mo­bil­ity re­stric­tions on con­cerns about the sec­ond wave of Covid-19 are smack­ing global stock mar­kets again.”</p>
    <p>Soar­ing Covid-19 fig­ures in some re­gions have fu­elled con­cerns over the reim­po­si­tion of move­ment re­stric­tion or­ders that will hurt economies fur­ther.</p>
    <p>France, for in­stance, has or­dered bars and restau­rants in Mar­seille to shut and will restrict open­ing hours in other cities to con­tain the virus.</p>
    <p>With ser­vice sec­tors al­ready lag­ging be­hind man­u­fac­tur­ing across most economies, those “di­ver­gen­cies are likely to per­sist” if the au­thor­i­ties con­tinue to tighten so­cial-mo­bil­ity re­stric­tions in re­sponse to ris­ing Covid-19 cases, said Mr Innes.</p>
    <p>The bench­mark Straits Times In­dex (STI) fell 1.22 per cent, or 30.32 points, to 2,450.82.</p>
    <p>Losers out­num­bered gain­ers 281 to 135, af­ter 1.33 bil­lion se­cu­ri­ties worth $1.21 bil­lion changed hands.</p>
    <p>The Sin­ga­pore Ex­change (SGX) was the only counter on the bluechip in­dex that ended in the black. Shares of SGX gained 0.7 per cent, or six cents, to $9.04.</p>
    <p>Sing­tel, on the other hand, failed to sus­tain Wed­nes­day’s gains and fell to the bot­tom of the ta­ble. The counter dropped 3.6 per cent to $2.12. It re­mained the most heav­ily traded STI stock with more than 35.9 mil­lion shares chang­ing hands.</p>
    <p>Other ac­tive coun­ters in­cluded Gent­ing Sin­ga­pore, which fell 1.5 per cent to 67 cents, and Com­fortDelGro, which shed 2.7 per cent to $1.42.</p>
    <p>Also heav­ily traded was Wil­mar In­ter­na­tional. Shares of the agri-food gi­ant fell 0.5 per cent to $4.36. Wil­mar said in a bourse fil­ing yes­ter­day that the pro­posed list­ing of its China unit is ex­pected to raise 13.9 bil­lion yuan (S$2.8 bil­lion).</p>
    <p>The STI’s per­for­mance was in line with re­gional bourses that were spooked by Wall Street’s sell-off.</p>
    <p>Hong Kong, Shang­hai and Tokyo were all down more than 1 per cent.</p>
    <p>Seoul slipped 2.6 per cent. “Con­sid­er­ing the sharp fall, there is lit­tle room for fur­ther de­cline, but volatil­ity will likely re­main high un­til the na­tional hol­i­day (at the end of the month),” Cape In­vest­ment & Se­cu­ri­ties an­a­lyst Han Ji-young said.</p>
    <p>Buck­ing the trend was Malaysia’s KLCI, which ended the day up 0.3 per cent.</p>
