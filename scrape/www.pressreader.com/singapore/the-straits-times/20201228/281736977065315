    <p>Madam Aida Ab­dul and her fam­ily had not taken a hol­i­day break since Malaysia first im­ple­mented its move­ment con­trol order in March, as they did not wish to risk con­tract­ing Covid-19. But as they started to feel a touch of cabin fever, they de­cided to take ad­van­tage of the long Christ­mas week­end.</p>
    <p>Most ho­tels which Madam Aida, a lawyer, looked at on­line were full, but she man­aged to se­cure a room when she called up a beach re­sort in Kuantan, Pa­hang, di­rectly.</p>
    <p>The 42-year-old mother of three said dur­ing her stay at the re­sort: “I’m not feel­ing too para­noid as we are stay­ing in an out­door chalet and not in a ho­tel room, so there is less risk of bump­ing into peo­ple. I sprayed ev­ery­thing with dis­in­fec­tant be­fore let­ting ev­ery­one in.”</p>
    <p>Malaysia’s hote­liers cheered when in­ter-state travel was al­lowed to re­sume on Dec 7.</p>
    <p>Ho­tel book­ings shot up over Christ­mas as well as for the up­com­ing New Year pe­riod, mostly at beach re­sorts, ac­cord­ing to the Malaysian As­so­ci­a­tion of Ho­tels (MAH), which rep­re­sents more than 900 ho­tels na­tion­wide.</p>
    <p>Quite a num­ber of ho­tels are of­fer­ing pro­mo­tions, with dis­counts of up to 70 per cent.</p>
    <p>But many do­mes­tic trav­ellers are still likely to be pru­dent about spend­ing and post­pone va­ca­tion plans due to a flag­ging econ­omy, cou­pled with the fear of Covid-19.</p>
    <p>In pre­vi­ous years, hote­liers have seen an oc­cu­pancy rate of up to 90 per cent dur­ing the Christ­mas pe­riod. “For the year-end hol­i­day pe­riod, we ex­pect an av­er­age oc­cu­pancy rate of 50 per cent to 60 per cent, de­pend­ing solely on the do­mes­tic mar­ket,” MAH chief ex­ec­u­tive Yap Lip Seng was quoted as say­ing by the New Straits Times last week.</p>
    <p>Is­land des­ti­na­tions like Langkawi are pop­u­lar and see­ing higher ho­tel oc­cu­pancy rates af­ter be­ing hit hard by the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>“We were in­formed that ho­tel book­ings around the is­land have been en­cour­ag­ing, and if it stays that way, we can achieve the tar­get of 250,000 tourist ar­rivals this month,” Langkawi Devel­op­ment Au­thor­ity chief ex­ec­u­tive Ah­mad Hezri Ad­nan was quoted as say­ing by the Ber­nama news agency on Dec 19.</p>
    <p>A worker at the five-star Datai Langkawi re­sort said it was see­ing a high oc­cu­pancy rate over the Christ­mas week­end.</p>
    <p>The Majestic Ho­tel i n Kuala Lumpur saw a surge in book­ings af­ter the travel ban was lifted. “We had a full oc­cu­pancy rate on Dec 25 and we are see­ing a very high oc­cu­pancy rate for Dec 26 as well. We are al­ready fully booked for Dec 31,” said one of its work­ers.</p>
    <p>Malaysia Air­ports Hold­ings group chief ex­ec­u­tive Mohd Shukrie Mohd Salleh said in a state­ment on Dec 23: “Our main hub, KL In­ter­na­tional Air­port, is ex­pect­ing more than 99,000 do­mes­tic pas­sen­gers and 19,000 in­ter­na­tional pas­sen­gers for the pe­riod be­tween Dec 24 and 31, a four­fold in­crease from the same pe­riod last month.”</p>
    <p>But with the coun­try’s cu­mu­la­tive Covid-19 in­fec­tions cross­ing the 100,000 mark last Thurs­day, some Malaysians re­main wary of trav­el­ling. “We are stay­ing at home be­cause of Covid-19. I want to go on hol­i­day and re­lax but not in this cli­mate,” said housewife Ka­t­rina Razali, 40. “I can’t re­lax when all I can think of is, ‘Is this safe?’”</p>
