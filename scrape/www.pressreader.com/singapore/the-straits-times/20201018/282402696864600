    <p>Get­ting there: Both Ma­rina South Fer­ries and Sin­ga­pore Is­land Cruise and Ferry Ser­vices ply the wa­ters be­tween the main­land and the South­ern Is­lands.</p>
    <p>A $15 two-way ticket typ­i­cally gets you from Ma­rina South Pier to St John’s Is­land (joined to Lazarus Is­land by a cause­way), as well as Kusu Is­land. Ma­rina South Fer­ries also stops at Big Sis­ter’s Is­land (one of the two Sis­ters’ Is­lands). It takes about 30 min­utes to get to these South­ern Is­lands from the main­land.</p>
    <p>It is best to book your tick­ets on­line as they some­times sell out.</p>
    <p>Note that the usual routes will not stop at Kusu Is­land dur­ing the Kusu pil­grim­age sea­son, which be­gan yes­ter­day and runs till Nov 14. To visit Kusu dur­ing this pe­riod, re­serve a seat at go.gov.sg/kps2020. Tick­ets are $16 (week­days) or $18 (week­ends and pub­lic hol­i­days) for adults.</p>
    <p>Info: mari­na­south­fer­ries.com/ sched­ule; is­land­cruise.com.sg/ ferry-sched­ule</p>
    <p>Tips: Take along your own water bot­tles and packed meals. Sun­screen, in­sect re­pel­lent, tis­sues, ground sheets and plas­tic bags for your trash will also come in handy.</p>
    <p>Do not feed the wild mon­keys.</p>
    <p>The ones at Big Sis­ter’s Is­land are known to be ag­gres­sive, so give them a wide berth and don’t leave your be­long­ings unat­tended.</p>
    <p>For a more flex­i­ble itin­er­ary, you can char­ter a boat and get up close to other South­ern Is­lands such as Pu­lau Hantu (Is­land of Ghosts), which is pop­u­lar with divers.</p>
    <p>Be care­ful while swim­ming and walk­ing around rocky ar­eas. Sea snakes, stone­fish and box jel­ly­fish – all of which are venomous – have been sighted in the area.</p>
    <p>As a pre­cau­tion, do not swim or do sea sports alone. Wear long-sleeved shirts and pants, and carry a flota­tion de­vice with you in the water.</p>
