    <p>• In a star­tling move that marked the big­gest chal­lenge yet to Hol­ly­wood’s tra­di­tional way of do­ing busi­ness, Warner Bros an­nounced on Thurs­day that 17 movies – its en­tire 2021 slate – would each ar­rive si­mul­ta­ne­ously in the­atres and on its sib­ling stream­ing ser­vice, the un­der­per­form­ing HBO Max.</p>
    <p>Rather than a wait of roughly 90 days, the pe­riod that stu­dios have long given the­atres to play films ex­clu­sively, HBO Max sub­scribers will get in­stant ac­cess to big-bud­get ex­trav­a­gan­zas like a Sui­cide Squad se­quel, Godzilla Vs Kong, Dune and The Ma­trix 4.</p>
    <p>Other movies speed­ing to liv­ing rooms next year i nclude LinManuel Mi­randa’s In The Heights, Clint East­wood’s Cry Ma­cho, the next Con­jur­ing hor­ror film, Space Jam: A New Legacy and a So­pra­nos pre­quel called The Many Saints Of Ne­wark.</p>
    <p>While the move amounted to 17 shots in the arm for HBO Max, which has strug­gled to at­tract sub­scribers since its in­tro­duc­tion in May for US$15 (S$20) a month, it was also a strik­ingly grim com­ment on the fu­ture of movie the­atres.</p>
    <p>Even with a widely an­tic­i­pated vac­cine, which is ex­pected in the com­ing months, Warn­erMe­dia does not be­lieve that moviego­ing in the United States will re­cover un­til at l east next au­tumn, an as­sess­ment that stands in sharp con­trast with what other ma­jor movie stu­dios and mul­ti­plex chains have sig­nalled.</p>
    <p>Warn­erMe­dia’s chief ex­ec­u­tive Ja­son Ki­lar said: “We are all in the mid­dle of a pan­demic, and we are all try­ing to fig­ure our way through it. One of the things we can do to be help­ful to them is to pro­vide them with a steady stream of big-bud­get, well-told sto­ries.”</p>
    <p>He said even if the coro­n­avirus threat re­ceded dra­mat­i­cally in the sum­mer, the new dis­tri­bu­tion model will stand for the year.</p>
    <p>How­ever, each movie will ap­pear on HBO Max for only one month be­fore leav­ing the ser­vice.</p>
    <p>In a state­ment, Ms Ann Sarnoff, chief ex­ec­u­tive of the Warn­erMe­dia Stu­dio and Net­works Group, called it a “unique, oneyear plan”.</p>
    <p>Mr Tony Em­merich, chair­man of the Warner Bros Pic­ture Group, stressed that Warner’s movies would con­tinue to have tra­di­tional the­atri­cal re­leases out­side the United States, where HBO Max does not ex­ist.</p>
    <p>HBO Max will be­gin rolling out over­seas next year.</p>
    <p>Many peo­ple in Hol­ly­wood saw Warn­erMe­dia’s po­si­tion­ing of its move as pro­vi­sional as disin­gen­u­ous: It will be al­most im­pos­si­ble to go back and it may force other stu­dios to aban­don the old model.</p>
    <p>The Warner Bros plan stands in stark con­trast to one pur­sued by Univer­sal Pic­tures, which has agreed to con­tinue pro­vid­ing the­atres with an ex­clu­sive play pe­riod of at least three weeks.</p>
