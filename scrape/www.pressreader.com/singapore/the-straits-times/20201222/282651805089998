    <p>Ur­ban farm­ing has taken root here in re­cent years, with hob­by­ists grow­ing herbs along cor­ri­dors, in com­mu­nity gar­dens and soon even on HDB carpark rooftops. If you are not sure where to start, City Sprouts’ bi-monthly Farm Day Out may of­fer some in­spi­ra­tion.</p>
    <p>Or­gan­ised by so­cial en­ter­prise City Sprouts at its Hen­der­son Road farm Sprout Hub, it is a chance for the pub­lic to in­ter­act with about 35 com­mer­cial and hob­by­ist farm­ers, who rent plots in green­houses.</p>
    <p>While the farm welcomes vis­i­tors daily, it is only dur­ing the open house that most farm­ers will be there to in­tro­duce their crops and grow­ing meth­ods.</p>
    <p>Th­ese in­clude aquapon­ics, in which waste pro­duced by reared fish sup­plies the nu­tri­ents for plants; and aero­pon­ics, in which plant roots grow in the air and are wa­tered by a nu­tri­ent so­lu­tion mist.</p>
    <p>Some farm­ers rear chick­ens, while oth­ers grow straw­ber­ries and med­i­cal mush­rooms such as cordy­ceps and lingzhi.</p>
    <p>City Sprouts co-founder Chee Zhi Kin hopes that by getting up close to the process, peo­ple will be less in­tim­i­dated by farm­ing. Many of their ten­ants are be­gin­ners, he points out, and went through trial and er­ror to pro­duce crops such as herbs and leafy greens.</p>
    <p>“We want to show­case t he di­verse ways peo­ple can grow and farm and show how easy it is to be in­volved i n grow­ing your own food,” he says.</p>
    <p>The Farm Day Out ses­sions have been a l ong time com­ing. City Sprouts, which was founded in 2018, moved into its cur­rent premises at the for­mer Hen­der­son sec­ondary school last year.</p>
    <p>The founders spent about six months ren­o­vat­ing it and planned an of­fi­cial open­ing for March, only to have it scup­pered by t he coro­n­avirus pan­demic.</p>
    <p>In Au­gust, its first open house fi­nally took off. It has since ex­panded to in­clude fringe ac­tiv­i­ties such as a fash­ion swop, held in col­lab­o­ra­tion with cloth­ing swop move­ments My Zero Waste Wardrobe and Cloop.</p>
    <p>And at the re­cent Christ­mas edi­tion held last week, guests con­trib­uted to a com­mu­nity sculp­ture in which they cre­ated a Christ­mas tree out of old plas­tic bot­tles. A to­tal of 200 peo­ple vis­ited the farm over four ses­sions.</p>
    <p>The next Farm Day Out is slated for Fe­bru­ary, where Mr Chee hopes the reg­u­la­tions will have eased to al­low for more vis­i­tors.</p>
    <p>“Covid-19 threw us a curve­ball in our first year here and we have been forced to adapt, but we are fi­nally see­ing the light at the end of the tun­nel,” he says.</p>
