    <p>SYD­NEY • Em­bat­tled Chi­nese telco Huawei ex­ited its main spon­sor­ship deal with rugby league’s Can­berra Raiders yes­ter­day, cit­ing a “neg­a­tive busi­ness en­vi­ron­ment” af­ter Aus­tralia blocked the com­pany from its 5G wire­less net­works.</p>
    <p>The Raiders were the tech gi­ant’s first large-scale sport­ing spon­sor­ship world­wide and Huawei has backed the club f or al­most a decade, with its logo and name on the front of the play­ing kit.</p>
    <p>But Huawei said in a state­ment that the “con­tin­ued neg­a­tive busi­ness en­vi­ron­ment is hav­ing a larger than orig­i­nally forecast im­pact on our planned rev­enue stream”, in ex­plain­ing its de­ci­sion to ter­mi­nate the deal a year early.</p>
    <p>“It is so dis­ap­point­ing that it has ended this way but we are very proud of the small role we have played in this great NRL (Na­tional Rugby League) club,” Huawei Aus­tralia’s cor­po­rate af­fairs chief Jeremy Mitchell said.</p>
    <p>“Our near decade as ma­jor spon­sor of the Raiders has been one of the most suc­cess­ful in Aus­tralian sport and we are very sad that it has come to an end.”</p>
    <p>China-Aus­tralia re­la­tions have nose­dived since Can­berra barred Huawei from its 5G wire­less net­works in 2018 due to per­ceived links to the Bei­jing govern­ment, which it de­nies. Ties took an­other hit when Aus­tralian Prime Min­is­ter Scott Mor­ri­son this year joined calls</p>
