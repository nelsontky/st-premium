    <p>TOKYO • Tokyo Games or­gan­is­ers es­ti­mate the cost of Covid-19 coun­ter­mea­sures for next year’s de­layed Olympics to run to around 100 bil­lion yen (S$1.28 bil­lion), Kyodo News re­ported yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The Yomi­uri Shim­bun had said a day ear­lier that the to­tal cost of de­lay­ing the Games for a year would run to 200 bil­lion yen. It added that coun­ter­mea­sures will be pri­mar­ily han­dled and paid for by the Ja­panese gov­ern­ment.</p>
    <p>When asked to com­ment on the Kyodo re­port, a spokesman said an an­nounce­ment would be made on an in­terim re­port fol­low­ing talks be­tween Tokyo 2020 or­gan­is­ers, the Tokyo metropoli­tan gov­ern­ment and the Ja­panese gov­ern­ment to­mor­row.</p>
    <p>The last of­fi­cial bud­get given by the or­gan­is­ing com­mit­tee last De­cem­ber, months be­fore the Games were post­poned be­cause of the Covid-19 pan­demic, had been US$12.9 bil­lion (S$17.25 bil­lion).</p>
    <p>Of this, the or­gan­is­ing com­mit­tee was due to cover US$5.8 bil­lion, with the rev­enue for this bud­get com­ing from spon­sor­ships, ticket sales, mar­ket­ing and the In­ter­na­tional Olympic Com­mit­tee (IOC).</p>
    <p>The rest will be tax­pay­ers’ money from the na­tional gov­ern­ment to the tune of US$1.4 bil­lion and US$5.7 bil­lion from the Tokyo metropoli­tan gov­ern­ment, the As­so­ci­ated Press re­ported.</p>
    <p>The IOC added that it ex­pects to pay US$800 mil­lion in ad­di­tional costs from the de­lay but has yet to firm up the de­tails.</p>
    <p>When Tokyo clinched the win­ning bid in 2013, it claimed the Games would cost US$7.3 bil­lion but costs have since spi­ralled well be­yond the ini­tial bud­get.</p>
    <p>Even be­fore the de­lay and the sub­se­quent Covid-19 coun­ter­mea­sures, the cost of stag­ing</p>
    <p>Tokyo 2020 had al­ready sur­passed the past two Games. Lon­don 2012 and Rio 2016 cost £8.92 bil­lion (S$15.9 bil­lion) and 43.3 bil­lion reais (S$10.9 bil­lion) re­spec­tively.</p>
    <p>The 2008 Bei­jing Olympics are still the most ex­pen­sive Sum­mer Games at US$40 bil­lion (S$53.5 bil­lion), but most of that cap­i­tal in­vested was spent on in­fra­struc­ture, un­like for Tokyo.</p>
    <p>The or­gan­is­ing com­mit­tee is ex­pected to of­fi­cially an­nounce an ad­justed bud­get be­fore next year.</p>
    <p>Had as­pects of the Games not been sim­pli­fied, like the scrap­ping of ath­lete wel­come cer­e­monies, the ex­tra costs could have been as much as 300 bil­lion yen be­fore the cost of coun­ter­mea­sures were taken into ac­count.</p>
    <p>John Coates, the chair­man of the IOC co­or­di­na­tion com­mis­sion, has promised that the Ath­letes’ Vil­lage will be the “safest place in Tokyo” dur­ing the Games.</p>
    <p>In or­der to pull that off, or­gan­is­ers cur­rently es­ti­mate a daily max­i­mum of 5,000 Covid-19 tests to be car­ried out from July 23-Aug 8.</p>
    <p>There will also be no late night par­ties or nights out. On top of safe dis­tanc­ing mea­sures, or­gan­is­ers are look­ing to limit com­peti­tors’ stays in the ath­letes’ vil­lage.</p>
    <p>Asked if ath­letes would also be told to re­frain from sight­see­ing, Coates said last week: “Yes. Stay­ing longer in­creases the po­ten­tial for prob­lems.”</p>
