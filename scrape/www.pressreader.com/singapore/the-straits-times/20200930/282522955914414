    <p>Bri­tish ac­tress Si­enna Miller re­vealed that the late Amer­i­can ac­tor Chad­wick Bose­man gave up part of his own earn­ings on the film 21 Bridges so that she was com­pen­sated fairly.</p>
    <p>“I asked for a num­ber that the stu­dio wouldn’t get to,” Miller, 38, told Em­pire Magazine.</p>
    <p>The 2019 crime thriller saw Miller and Bose­man team up as detectives. He was also the film’s co-pro­ducer and in­stru­men­tal in get­ting her on board.</p>
    <p>She told Em­pire: “He was a fan of my work, which was thrilling be­cause it was re­cip­ro­cated from me to him, ten-fold. So he ap­proached me to do it, he of­fered me this film and it was at a time when I really didn’t want to work any­more. I’d been work­ing non­stop and I was ex­hausted, but then I wanted to work with him.”</p>
    <p>As her eight-year-old daugh­ter Mar­lowe was also start­ing school, she told her­self that she would do it only if she was “com­pen­sated in the right way”.</p>
    <p>“And Chad­wick ended up do­nat­ing some of his salary to get me to the num­ber that I had asked for... he said that that was what I de­served to be paid,” she said.</p>
    <p>The Black Pan­ther ac­tor died on Aug 28 at the age of 43, after a bat­tle with colon can­cer.</p>
    <p>She re­counted the gra­cious­ness and re­spect with which he treated her, adding: “There was no showi­ness... it was, ‘Of course I’ll get you to that num­ber be­cause that’s what you should be paid.’”</p>
