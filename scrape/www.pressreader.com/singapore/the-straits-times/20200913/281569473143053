    <p>If Mr Anil Balchan­dani were to charge for the work he did for for­mer maid Parti Liyani, his client would have had to fork out about $150,000.</p>
    <p>That was the fig­ure he gave at a press con­fer­ence when asked how much the le­gal bat­tle would have cost.</p>
    <p>While lawyers like Mr Balchan­dani, who vol­un­teer un­der the Crim­i­nal Le­gal Aid Scheme, are paid a to­ken fee, spend­ing time on pro bono work means hav­ing to forgo bill­able work.</p>
    <p>Lawyers in­ter­viewed by The Sun­day Times said they also of­ten have to bear outof-pocket ex­penses, such as fly­ing in wit­nesses who are over­seas and pay­ing for medical re­ports.</p>
    <p>Mr Eu­gene Thu­raisingam, who in 2016 re­ceived the Le­gal As­sis­tance Scheme for Cap­i­tal Of­fences award from Chief Jus­tice Sun­daresh Menon for his work in death penalty cases, said: “Op­por­tu­nity costs are in­evitable when we take on pro bono work.”</p>
    <p>He es­ti­mates that, based on the av­er­age lawyer charg­ing $500 an hour, 100 hours of pro bono work a year may be val­ued at $50,000.</p>
    <p>But “we be­lieve that jus­tice must be ac­ces­si­ble to ev­ery­one, not just to those who can af­ford to pay”.</p>
    <p>Veteran lawyer Amo­lat Singh, who has re­ceived many awards for his vol­un­teer work, re­called a client who, for 10 years af­ter he acted for her, would bake a cake for him on Chi­nese New Year.</p>
    <p>He said: “Of­ten­times, the grat­i­tude that I re­ceive from those I have helped is far greater than the joy of re­ceiv­ing cash.”</p>
