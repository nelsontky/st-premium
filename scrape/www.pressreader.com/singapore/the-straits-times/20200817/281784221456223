    <p>HONG KONG • Hong Kong’s leader says she has “re­turned” her hon­orary fel­low­ship to a Cam­bridge col­lege after a row over whether the fi­nance hub’s aca­demic free­doms are be­ing sup­pressed as the au­thor­i­ties crack down on prodemoc­racy op­po­nents.</p>
    <p>Chief Ex­ec­u­tive Car­rie Lam said she was cut­ting ties with Cam­bridge Uni­ver­sity’s Wolf­son Col­lege after it be­gan look­ing into the state of aca­demic lib­erty in Hong Kong.</p>
    <p>Mrs Lam said she was “deeply dis­ap­pointed by the col­lege smear­ing a per­son on the ba­sis of hearsay in­stead of facts”.</p>
    <p>“There­fore I can hardly con­vince my­self to main­tain any re­la­tion with Wolf­son Col­lege,” she wrote on Face­book late on Satur­day along­side a photo of her­self in leafy Cam­bridge.</p>
    <p>Wolf­son Col­lege said it had re­cently raised con­cerns with the</p>
    <p>Hong Kong leader about “her com­mit­ment to the pro­tec­tion of hu­man rights and the free­dom of ex­pres­sion”.</p>
    <p>Its gov­ern­ing body had been due to con­sider Mrs Lam’s fel­low­ship next month, but would no longer do so now that she had re­turned the hon­our.</p>
    <p>Mrs Lam, a pro-Bei­jing ap­pointee, was one of a num­ber of Chi­nese and Hong Kong of­fi­cials sanc­tioned by the United States after Bei­jing im­posed a sweep­ing se­cu­rity law on the semi-au­ton­o­mous city in late June.</p>
    <p>The law ramps up the Chi­nese Com­mu­nist Party’s con­trol over the fi­nance hub.</p>
    <p>In the weeks that fol­lowed, some two dozen pro-democ­racy sup­port­ers were ar­rested un­der the new pow­ers, in­clud­ing the owner of a Bei­jing-crit­i­cal news­pa­per.</p>
    <p>Oth­ers have been dis­qual­i­fied from stand­ing in lo­cal elec­tions, while li­braries and schools have be­gun pulling any books deemed to breach the law.</p>
    <p>Three well-known aca­demics also lost their jobs be­cause they had been pre­vi­ously jailed for lead­ing pro-democ­racy protests.</p>
    <p>Wolf­son Col­lege had been un­der pres­sure to re­scind Mrs Lam’s hon­orary fel­low­ship since last year.</p>
    <p>In Novem­ber, three mem­bers of Bri­tain’s House of Lords called for the move over Mrs Lam’s re­sponse to months of huge and of­ten vi­o­lent pro-democ­racy protests.</p>
    <p>The Chi­nese army has re­leased footage of its Hong Kong gar­ri­son fir­ing can­non and tor­pe­does in a drill in the South China Sea amid ris­ing ten­sions be­tween Bei­jing and Wash­ing­ton over the sta­tus of the for­mer Bri­tish colony.</p>
    <p>The Peo­ple’s Lib­er­a­tion Army re­cently tested the weaponry, in­clud­ing a tor­pedo launch from the ves­sel Huizhou that suc­cess­fully hit its tar­get, ac­cord­ing to a Weibo post by state broad­caster CCTV yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The ex­er­cise fol­lows the de­ploy­ment by the US Navy of a car­rier strike group to the area to con­duct mar­itime air-de­fence op­er­a­tions.</p>
    <p>The ex­er­cise also in­cluded he­li­copter op­er­a­tions, anti-ter­ror­ism and anti-piracy drills, and emer­gency res­cue train­ing, ac­cord­ing to the Weibo post.</p>
