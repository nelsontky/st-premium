    <p>LON­DON • No sooner had Dean Smith won the fight against rel­e­ga­tion than a bat­tle to keep star Jack Gre­al­ish at As­ton Villa started.</p>
    <p>Asked about the mid­fielder’s fu­ture af­ter Villa drew 1-1 at West Ham on the fi­nal day of the sea­son,</p>
    <p>Smith said: “He goes out and gets drunk with me now!”</p>
    <p>Yet the man­ager knows that with just a seven-week break be­fore the new Premier League sea­son starts, hang­ing on to the club’s tal­is­man is key. Gre­al­ish scored the opener on</p>
    <p>Sun­day and the 24-year-old, con­tracted with Villa un­til 2023, has a host of po­ten­tial suit­ors in­clud­ing Manchester United.</p>
    <p>“We’ve got bil­lion­aire own­ers (Wes Edens and Nassef Sawiris) and he’d cost a lot, a lot of money,” Smith warned.</p>
    <p>Keep­ing hold of Gre­al­ish would have been much harder had they dropped to the League Cham­pi­onship. Villa picked up eight points from their fi­nal four games to sur­vive by a point in 17th place.</p>
    <p>They were sec­ond-bot­tom when the league was sus­pended in March and Smith be­lieves his side used that coro­n­avirus-en­forced break bet­ter than any other.</p>
    <p>“We worked very hard, be­cause we knew we had to be de­fen­sively bet­ter,” he said. “It’s a proud moment, and it ac­tu­ally feels bet­ter than last year go­ing up in the play­offs.”</p>
    <p>Be­fore the restart, Villa faced an av­er­age of 18.1 shots per game, of which 5.6 were on tar­get and 2.0 con­ceded. Af­ter the break, they faced an av­er­age of 10.1 shots per game, of which 2.8 were on tar­get and 1.1 con­ceded. They also brought down er­rors lead­ing to shots from 0.85 per game to 0.2.</p>
    <p>At the other end of the field, Gre­al­ish’s eight goals and six as­sists in the league made him the club’s top scorer and cre­ator.</p>
    <p>“What a day. Keep­ing my club in the premier l eague for an­other year. MY club,” the skipper tweeted of his home­town club, adding heart and foot­ball emo­jis.</p>
    <p>In con­trast, Wat­ford captain Troy Deeney did not rule out the pos­si­bil­ity that he may have played his fi­nal game for the team af­ter they were rel­e­gated fol­low­ing their 3-2 loss at Arse­nal, while Bournemout­h man­ager Eddie Howe was un­sure about his fu­ture with the Cher­ries af­ter they failed to stay up de­spite a 3-1 vic­tory at Ever­ton.</p>
    <p>“It hurts. I’m try­ing to keep it to­gether, I’m re­ally sad for the fans of this club,” Howe, in charge of the side since 2012, told BBC Sport. “It’s a time for re­flec­tion, a time to see what the next step is.</p>
    <p>“Ev­ery­thing at the club is based around stay­ing i n the Premier League and I’ll speak to the peo­ple that I need to speak to.</p>
    <p>“It’s a very quick turn­around and we have to make the right de­ci­sions now.”</p>
    <p>NOSES TO THE GRIND­STONE</p>
    <p>We worked very hard, be­cause we knew we had to be de­fen­sively bet­ter. It’s a proud moment, and it ac­tu­ally feels bet­ter than last year go­ing up in the play-offs. ’’</p>
