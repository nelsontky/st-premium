    <p>Most of us get that bit wiser af­ter an event that causes us to lose money, such as fall­ing for an on­line scam. Chances are we would never fall for a sim­i­lar ruse again: Once bit­ten, twice shy, as the say­ing goes.</p>
    <p>But this rule ap­par­ently does not ap­ply to many in­vestors who pre­fer to be­lieve that to­mor­row will al­ways be bet­ter.</p>
    <p>Oth­er­wise, how do you ex­plain why we keep see­ing the same reck­less be­hav­iour of folks who try to win in the stock mar­ket in the hopes of mak­ing it big in ev­ery down­turn, in­clud­ing the cur­rent one. And worse, some peo­ple ac­tu­ally jump into the stock mar­ket with money bor­rowed on their credit cards.</p>
    <p>The de­sire to strike it rich has re­sulted in a strong up­swing in stock mar­kets world­wide in re­cent months even though the pan­demic is far from over and coun­tries are braced for hard times ahead.</p>
    <p>You would think that af­ter suc­ces­sive shocks to the mar­ket in re­cent mem­ory – the fi­nan­cial cri­sis of 2008 and the oil price plunge in 2015, peo­ple would be smarter with their in­vest­ments.</p>
    <p>The re­al­ity is that many choose to take the blink­ered ap­proach – they see the cur­rent down­turn as a chance to get rich by pick­ing up “cheap” stocks while be­ing blind to the fact that the down­turn can cause the same stocks to be­come even cheaper and thus cause deeper losses.</p>
    <p>So be­fore you leap back into the game, it pays to be grounded with ev­er­green in­vest­ment tips that may save you from fi­nan­cial ruin.</p>
    <p>1. Never try to time the mar­ket</p>
    <p>I had a ring­side seat to this phe­nom­e­non be­ing played out here dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker, which saw many ma­jor busi­nesses shut­tered.</p>
    <p>When the an­nounce­ment of the tighter lock­down was made on Fri­day, April 3, I ex­pected a stock in my port­fo­lio, which was al­ready bat­tered down, to dive even more since the shut­down would af­fect 100 per cent of its busi­ness.</p>
    <p>I felt a tinge of re­gret then for fail­ing to sell the stock ear­lier but I con­soled my­self that since it was a longer-term in­vest­ment, I should not be overly con­cerned with the near-term volatil­ity.</p>
    <p>But what sur­prised me was that when trad­ing re­sumed the fol­low­ing Mon­day, the share ac­tu­ally went up. The log­i­cal ex­pla­na­tion for this un­ex­pected event, in bro­ker-speak, was that the share was al­ready over­sold and since the “bad news” was not that bad, the stock re­cov­ered.</p>
    <p>Its price con­tin­ued to go up over the fol­low­ing two months af­ter a higher-than-usual div­i­dend was an­nounced, per­haps as an as­sur­ance to share­hold­ers that it re­mains on solid ground.</p>
    <p>Had I tried to time the mar­ket by sell­ing the share ear­lier so that I could buy it back at a lower price later, I would have suf­fered losses be­cause the dip never hap­pened.</p>
    <p>2. In­vest only what you can af­ford to lose</p>
    <p>Un­less you have found a crys­tal ball that lets you peek into the fu­ture, all in­vest­ments come with risk. For in­stance, no one could tell back in De­cem­ber that in just three months, the whole world would be “shut down”.</p>
    <p>So if you in­vest all your spare cash or, even worse, in­vest us­ing loans, you can find your­self in dire straits when things turn bad. Even if you can spare $100,000 or even mil­lions, it is bet­ter to not in­vest all at one go but spread it out in tranches. I am very con­ser­va­tive when it comes to in­vest­ing my hard-earned salary but if my in­vest­ment has turned in a profit, I will take more risks with the profit be­cause los­ing a wind­fall is less painful than los­ing your own money.</p>
    <p>3. Don’t fol­low the herd</p>
    <p>The worst thing you can do is to in­vest based on tips from friends of a friend. Due to the fear of los­ing out, some peo­ple will just buy into a “hot” stock even though they have no clue what the com­pany does.</p>
    <p>Then there are those who are very con­fi­dent be­cause they fol­low the in­vest­ment styles of leg­endary in­vestors who have be­come bil­lion­aires due to their as­tute skills.</p>
    <p>While there is noth­ing wrong in try­ing to learn from the best, you must re­alise that the chances of achiev­ing sim­i­lar suc­cess is al­most zero un­less you have un­lim­ited cash at your dis­posal.</p>
    <p>A in­vestor with $10 bil­lion can still bounce back with the last bil­lion even if he loses 90 per cent of his wealth. That’s why they can af­ford to in­vest when the rest of us are scared stiff.</p>
    <p>Ask your­self this: Were you busy buy­ing up all the rock-bot­tom bank stocks dur­ing the 2008 fi­nan­cial cri­sis? With per­fect hind­sight, many wished they had but the re­al­ity was they had no money to do so then.</p>
    <p>4. It’s noth­ing per­sonal, it’s just busi­ness</p>
    <p>Some in­vestors tend to get overly sen­ti­men­tal af­ter they hold cer­tain stocks for years. And even when the out­look for the share dips, they refuse to let go, hop­ing that it will even­tu­ally re­cover its glory days.</p>
    <p>Even worse, some share­hold­ers view them­selves as loyal cus­tomers who will con­tinue to sup­port the com­pany come what may.</p>
    <p>The re­al­ity is that the man­age­ment won’t even know you have bought its shares un­less you show up and shake the boss’s hand at the an­nual gen­eral meet­ing. Even so, un­like cus­tomers who have the right to de­mand re­funds for bad deals, in­vestors won’t get any com­pen­sa­tion for stock losses be­cause they are deemed to be “own­ers” of the com­pany, al­beit small ones.</p>
    <p>So if you think it is pru­dent to cut your losses by sell­ing the stock, do it and get some of your money back.</p>
    <p>5. Long term does not mean fire-and-for­get</p>
    <p>Many peo­ple seem to think that a long-term in­vest­ment means buy­ing a stock or fund, keep­ing it for years and then all will be fine.</p>
    <p>This may be true for some re­silient in­vest­ments but it does not mean you can take your eye off all your long-term in­vest­ments.</p>
    <p>Oth­er­wise, you may wake up one day to find that your port­fo­lio has be­come worth­less sim­ply be­cause the com­pa­nies have run into fi­nan­cial trou­bles.</p>
    <p>This is espe­cially true now be­cause many firms are fac­ing the twin threats of a se­vere re­ces­sion as well as dis­rup­tion by tech­nol­ogy.</p>
    <p>If you don’t have time to mon­i­tor your port­fo­lio, you should stick to less risky prod­ucts such as gov­ern­ment bonds and mark the ma­tu­rity dates in your cal­en­dar.</p>
    <p>6. Don’t ven­ture into the un­known</p>
    <p>You are un­likely to walk into a tour agency, hand over $10,000 and tell the op­er­a­tor to sign you up for a mys­tery trip.</p>
    <p>If you won’t buy some­thing with­out know­ing what it is, you should also never in­vest in some­thing you don’t re­ally un­der­stand.</p>
    <p>For in­stance, you should re­mind all the se­niors in your house­holds that if all they want is to put their money in fixed de­posits, they must never sign up for any­thing that of­fers higher rates, no mat­ter how at­trac­tive it seems, espe­cially if they do not un­der­stand how it works.</p>
    <p>Fi­nally, know that money won’t just fall out of the sky with­out you putting in time and ef­fort. So it pays to in­vest in im­prov­ing your knowl­edge first so that you can make in­formed de­ci­sions and bets.</p>
