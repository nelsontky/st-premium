    <p>JTC Cor­po­ra­tion has con­firmed 400 cases of unau­tho­rised sub­let­ting in an on­go­ing in­ves­ti­ga­tion that will be com­pleted by the first half of next year.</p>
    <p>The up­date to Par­lia­ment yes­ter­day came in re­sponse to Work­ers’ Party MP Louis Chua (Sengkang GRC), who noted an Au­di­tor-Gen­eral’s Of­fice (AGO) report flag­ging that JTC premises may have been sub­let to 26,000 en­ti­ties with­out ap­proval.</p>
    <p>Sec­ond Min­is­ter for Trade and In­dus­try Tan See Leng said the 26,000 business en­ti­ties were iden­ti­fied be­cause they had in­di­cated a JTC site as their reg­is­tered ad­dress, even though they were not lessees, ten­ants or au­tho­rised sub-lessees.</p>
    <p>He added that JTC has so far found that 1,900 of these firms have been dereg­is­tered, while 700 are on di­vested prop­er­ties where its sub­let­ting pol­icy does not ap­ply.</p>
    <p>A fur­ther 12,400 are re­lated en­ti­ties of JTC lessees and ten­ants. “For these cases, even if there was sub­let­ting of space, there would not have been any po­ten­tial loss of rev­enue as sub­let­ting fees would not have ap­plied,” Dr Tan said.</p>
    <p>These 15,000 en­ti­ties ac­count for around 60 per cent of the cases the AGO high­lighted. JTC has pri­ori­tised in­ves­ti­ga­tions for the re­main­ing 11,000 or so en­ti­ties.</p>
    <p>Dr Tan said JTC’s pre­lim­i­nary in­ves­ti­ga­tions have found that a sig­nif­i­cant num­ber are us­ing its premises as their reg­is­tered ad­dress, even though they are not phys­i­cally op­er­at­ing out of the premises. “These cases also do not in­volve any unau­tho­rised sub­let­ting of space.”</p>
    <p>He said: “JTC is strength­en­ing its pro­cesses and in­spec­tion regime, and will make use of data an­a­lyt­ics to bet­ter de­tect in­ci­dences of unau­tho­rised sub­let­ting. It will take en­force­ment ac­tion against lessees or ten­ants for con­firmed cases of unau­tho­rised sub­let­ting.”</p>
    <p>En­force­ment can range from mea­sures to re­cover the sub­let fees owed to JTC to le­gal ac­tion.</p>
    <p>The AGO was the sub­ject of two other ques­tions from Leader of the Op­po­si­tion Pri­tam Singh, who asked if the Man­power Min­istry will un­der­take a more wide-scale re­view of the num­ber of suc­cess­ful ca­reer switches un­der the Pro­fes­sional Con­ver­sion Pro­gramme (PCP). This came af­ter the AGO noted that three pro­gramme part­ners did not carry out ad­e­quate ver­i­fi­ca­tion of ca­reer con­ver­sion for 11 cases in­volv­ing 15 par­tic­i­pants.</p>
    <p>Man­power Min­is­ter Josephine Teo said: “Work­force Sin­ga­pore (WSG) has... ver­i­fied that all 15 par­tic­i­pants changed their job scopes and con­verted into new job roles through their re­spec­tive PCPs.</p>
    <p>“WSG will be de­vel­op­ing a new PCP guide... by the end of the year. The doc­u­ment will in­clude guide­lines on how ca­reer con­ver­sion should be con­sis­tently as­sessed, as well as the crit­i­cal in­for­ma­tion that pro­gramme part­ners should report to en­sure bet­ter and con­sis­tent mon­i­tor­ing of PCP out­comes.”</p>
    <p>She said pro­gramme part­ners will fo­cus on the most im­por­tant out­come in­di­ca­tors, such as the num­ber of place­ments and par­tic­i­pants who com­pleted train­ing.</p>
    <p>WSG will also con­duct sam­pling checks of up to 20 per cent of PCP place­ments by its pro­gramme part­ners on a reg­u­lar ba­sis.</p>
    <p>Mr Singh also asked how En­ter­prise Sin­ga­pore (ESG) will en­sure strict com­pli­ance of the En­ter­prise De­vel­op­ment Grant, which states that firms must have at least 30 per cent lo­cal share­hold­ing.</p>
    <p>Min­is­ter of State for Trade and In­dus­try Low Yen Ling said ESG had sup­ported al­most 5,000 projects un­der the grant as at last month, and checks are per­formed dur­ing the grant ap­proval process. If firms breach con­di­tions, ESG will with­hold the dis­burse­ment or claw back the grant. The firms might also be put on a watch­list for stricter scru­tiny in fu­ture grant ap­pli­ca­tions.</p>
