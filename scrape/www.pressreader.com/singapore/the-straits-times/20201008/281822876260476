    <p>Thou­sands of pre-school­ers ex­pressed their grat­i­tude to those at the front line of the Covid-19 fight by send­ing mes­sages of ap­pre­ci­a­tion to health­care staff.</p>
    <p>They also packed food sup­plies for mi­grant work­ers.</p>
    <p>A record num­ber of pre-schools took part in this year’s Start Small Dream Big move­ment, which is part of the Pres­i­dent’s Chal­lenge.</p>
    <p>In to­tal, 53,000 chil­dren from 950 pre-schools spent 1.5 mil­lion hours work­ing on com­mu­nity ser­vice projects aimed at teach­ing them kind­ness and com­pas­sion, said the Early Child­hood De­vel­op­ment Agency, which ini­ti­ated the move­ment, yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Thank­ing the chil­dren for show­ing care and com­pas­sion, Pres­i­dent Hal­imah Ya­cob called on Sin­ga­pore­ans to “work to­gether to make Sin­ga­pore a more car­ing and in­clu­sive home for all”.</p>
    <p>Ini­ti­ated in 2015, the move­ment saw 8,000 chil­dren from 150 preschools take part in the first year.</p>
    <p>Since then, the ini­tia­tive has gone from strength to strength, with 49,000 chil­dren from 820 preschools par­tic­i­pat­ing in last year’s edition.</p>
    <p>One pre-school which took part this year was the YWCA Child De­vel­op­ment Cen­tre in Ou­tram.</p>
    <p>It com­piled a video con­vey­ing its pre-school­ers’ mes­sages of ap­pre­ci­a­tion and en­cour­age­ment to the health­care work­ers at Sin­ga­pore Gen­eral Hos­pi­tal.</p>
    <p>The chil­dren also pre­pared mask cases and hand­made posters, which were de­liv­ered by their teach­ers to the health­care staff on their be­half.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, chil­dren from Green­land Child­care @ Pung­gol Drive col­lected and packed dried food sup­plies for mi­grant work­ers.</p>
    <p>The sup­plies were de­liv­ered with the help of SG Ac­ci­dent Help Cen­tre, a non-profit or­gan­i­sa­tion.</p>
    <p>Pre-school­ers also brought some cheer to se­niors liv­ing in nurs­ing homes who have seen fewer vis­i­tors due to safe dis­tanc­ing mea­sures amid the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Chil­dren from Lit­tle Green House @ Jurong West 502 pre­pared board games us­ing re­cy­cled ma­te­ri­als and filmed their own in­struc­tional videos to teach se­niors how to play them.</p>
    <p>Over vir­tual en­gage­ment ses­sions fa­cil­i­tated by the Agency for In­te­grated Care (AIC) and the Com­mu­nity Chest, the chil­dren spent time with res­i­dents at St An­drew’s Nurs­ing Home in Ta­man Jurong and the All Saints Home in Jurong East.</p>
    <p>AIC chief ex­ec­u­tive Tan Kwang Cheak said: “It is heart­en­ing to know that the vir­tual in­ter-gen­er­a­tional vis­its and in­struc­tional videos have helped bridge safe dis­tanc­ing mea­sures to con­nect chil­dren with se­niors.”</p>
