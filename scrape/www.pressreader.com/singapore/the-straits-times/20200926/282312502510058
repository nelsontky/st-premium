    <p>A scathing post by a Sin­ga­pore Airlines (SIA) share­holder on the car­rier’s record in fuel hedg­ing has been mak­ing its rounds.</p>
    <p>Chart­ing a per­for­mance over a 14-year pe­riod from 2007 to 2020, culled from the air­line’s own fi­nan­cial re­ports, Mr Lim Seng Hoo said SIA had lost more than it gained from hedg­ing ac­tiv­i­ties.</p>
    <p>In to­tal, the com­pany had lost more than $3.5 bil­lion in the pe­riod from hedg­ing, a tool which allows big fuel con­sumers to lock in fu­ture con­tracts when prices are favourable.</p>
    <p>The prac­tice is not un­com­mon. Other airlines hedge, although some have stopped, ship­ping com­pa­nies hedge, land trans­port com­pa­nies – in­clud­ing lo­cal gi­ant Com­fortDelGro – hedge. Even oil and en­ergy groups hedge.</p>
    <p>Most com­pa­nies, in­clud­ing SIA, hedge only a por­tion of their fuel con­sump­tion – which in it­self is a kind of hedge.</p>
    <p>Even so, with oil prices plung­ing to record lows this year, many com­pa­nies are likely to re­port hedg­ing losses. They would have agreed to pay far higher rates for fuel than they needed to.</p>
    <p>Air France-KLM, ac­cord­ing to Forbes, faces a US$1 bil­lion (S$1.37 bil­lion) hedg­ing loss this year.</p>
    <p>SIA said it hedges to re­duce the volatil­ity of fuel prices – its single largest op­er­at­ing ex­pense.</p>
    <p>As fuel prices can be volatile, hedg­ing helps flat­ten this cost com­po­nent, al­low­ing the car­rier to price its tick­ets in re­sponse to changes in the com­pet­i­tive mar­ket­place.</p>
    <p>“Dam­p­en­ing the volatil­ity in fuel costs sig­nif­i­cantly re­duces the volatil­ity in the profit and loss state­ment,” its spokesman noted.</p>
    <p>In bet­ter times, hedg­ing was less of an is­sue, be­cause the na­tional car­rier re­mained prof­itable de­spite any hedg­ing losses.</p>
    <p>But as the air­line in­curs its maiden losses in nearly half a cen­tury, and as it em­barks on re­dun­dancy ex­er­cises, fuel-hedg­ing losses be­come glar­ing. SIA said Covid-19 has led to this cri­sis, cit­ing it is now op­er­at­ing at merely 8 per cent of ca­pac­ity.</p>
    <p>But Mr Lim said its hedg­ing trou­bles be­gan long be­fore the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to his post on his Face­book page, SIA re­ported hedg­ing gains in six out of the 14 years. And the gains were far smaller than the losses.</p>
    <p>SIA has been hedg­ing since the 1990s, but it was not able to share its hedg­ing per­for­mance go­ing that far back.</p>
    <p>But now, its 2007-2020 fuel-hedg­ing per­for­mance brings into ques­tion the very prac­tice of hedg­ing. In­deed, ob­servers pointed out that the weak­ness is not hedg­ing per se, but SIA’s de­ci­sion to hedge con­tracts that are as long as five years (most com­pa­nies hedge for a year).</p>
    <p>This, they said, is highly spec­u­la­tive, and runs counter to the ba­sic prin­ci­ple of hedg­ing. It locks in the air­line’s fuel po­si­tion for an ex­tended pe­riod, pre­vent­ing it from ben­e­fi­cial cost ma­noeu­vres.</p>
    <p>In­deed, no other air­line is known to have such long fuel hedges. In fact, some have ceased hedg­ing al­to­gether. Amer­i­can Airlines stopped hedg­ing in 2014.</p>
    <p>In a Wall Street Jour­nal ar­ti­cle, its chief ex­ec­u­tive Scott Kirby said: “Hedg­ing is a rigged game that en­riches Wall Street.”</p>
    <p>Mr Rod Ed­ding­ton, for­mer chief ex­ec­u­tive of Bri­tish Air­ways (BA), once said: “When you hedge, all you do is bet against the ex­perts in the oil mar­ket and pay the mid­dle­man.</p>
    <p>“You can run from high fuel prices briefly through hedg­ing but you can’t run for very long.”</p>
    <p>Per­haps the air­line should have lis­tened. IAG, the par­ent group of BA, said ear­lier this year the car­rier would slash 12,000 jobs as it in­curred losses of €1.3 bil­lion</p>
    <p>(S$2.1 bil­lion) from fuel and cur­rency hedges.</p>
    <p>So, should SIA re­view its fuel hedg­ing pol­icy? In a word, yes.</p>
    <p>At the very least, it should re­think its five-year hedge.</p>
    <p>But jet-fuel prices have been on the rise since May.</p>
    <p>If world economies open up as the Covid-19 cri­sis sub­sides, the up­trend may con­tinue, and the hedg­ing po­si­tions of car­ri­ers – in­clud­ing SIA – may soon be­gin to look pos­i­tive once again.</p>
    <p>If and when this hap­pens, the ur­gency to weigh the risks of hedg­ing against its ben­e­fits might wane.</p>
    <p>It would be busi­ness as usual.</p>
    <p>And that would be tragic.</p>
