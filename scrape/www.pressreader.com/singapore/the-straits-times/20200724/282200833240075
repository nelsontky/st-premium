    <p>TOKYO • The Olympic caul­dron will re­main un­lit and its sta­dium empty to­day as the virus-trig­gered post­pone­ment of the Tokyo Games leaves fans won­der­ing if it is still worth hold­ing on to tick­ets and ho­tel op­er­a­tors fret­ting over thou­sands of va­cant rooms.</p>
    <p>Ja­pan will still mark the day orig­i­nally sched­uled for the open­ing cer­e­mony with a na­tional hol­i­day. But there will be lit­tle to cel­e­brate amid con­tin­ued un­cer­tainty over stag­ing the Games next year.</p>
    <p>Dylan Crain, a Florida res­i­dent who had tick­ets to at­tend the open­ing event and helped plan the trip for a group of 12, said he is less will­ing to go to the Games, which are set to start on July 23 next year, as reschedul­ing with so many peo­ple would be “hard to jus­tify”.</p>
    <p>The Ja­pan gov­ern­ment had ex­pected the Games to fuel a surge in over­seas vis­i­tors to 40 mil­lion this year; now, it may not even reach five mil­lion. Spend­ing by over­seas vis­i­tors will be a frac­tion of the 4.8 tril­lion yen (S$62.1 bil­lion) splashed last year, with the failed Olympic bet threat­en­ing to re-en­trench Ja­panese firms’ con­ser­va­tive stance on in­vest­ment.</p>
    <p>A num­ber of big ho­tel chains in­clud­ing Prince Ho­tels & Re­sorts have de­layed open­ing new fa­cil­i­ties. A third of the 620,000 work­ers in the ho­tel in­dus­try were still on leave in May, ac­cord­ing to the Min­istry of In­ter­nal Af­fairs. But even with staff fur­loughed, some ho­tels could not weather the storm.</p>
    <p>The White Bear Fam­ily Com­pany group filed for bank­ruptcy pro­tec­tion with 35 bil­lion yen in debt, a record for Ja­pan’s tourism in­dus­try, ac­cord­ing to re­search firm Teikoku Data­bank.</p>
    <p>“This was sup­posed to be the busiest time for us ever,” said Naoyuki Fuku­uchi, man­ag­ing di­rec­tor at Ja­pan Ho­tel As­so­ci­a­tion. “In­stead, we are in a dire sit­u­a­tion like never be­fore.”</p>
    <p>Should the Games be can­celled, the fi­nan­cial im­pli­ca­tions would be dis­as­trous for them and in­ter­na­tional sports fed­er­a­tions alike. By last week, the fed­er­a­tions had re­ceived US$60 mil­lion (S$83.2 mil­lion) from the In­ter­na­tional Olympic Com­mit­tee (IOC) as they strug­gle with fi­nan­cial prob­lems. In May, the IOC pledged US$800 mil­lion, with US$650 mil­lion to help cover post­pone­ment costs and US$150 mil­lion to sup­port the Olympic move­ment.</p>
    <p>“A can­cel­la­tion of the Tokyo Games would be se­ri­ous, both fi­nan­cially and from a sport­ing per­spec­tive for most in­ter­na­tional fed­er­a­tions,” said JeanLoup Chap­pelet, pro­fes­sor emer­i­tus at the Swiss Grad­u­ate School of Pub­lic Ad­min­is­tra­tion and a spe­cial­ist in the Olympic move­ment.</p>
