    <p>Pro­duc­ing her own draw­ings dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker gave de­but au­thor Mok Zin­ing a kind of free­dom from writ­ing.</p>
    <p>In mid-March, the 25-year-old re­turned home from the Univer­sity of Min­nesota in the United States, where she is pur­su­ing a master’s de­gree in cre­ative writ­ing.</p>
    <p>Her first book, The Or­chid Fo­lios, which is about the his­tory and sym­bol­ism of the Vanda Miss Joaquim or­chid, Sin­ga­pore’s na­tional flower, will be pub­lished by Ethos Books in Sin­ga­pore in Novem­ber.</p>
    <p>When the cir­cuit breaker started in early April, Mok, who is sin­gle, could not en­gage in hob­bies like rock climb­ing, which she used to do in the US.</p>
    <p>She started draw­ing more, iron­i­cally find­ing com­fort in be­ing “so bad” at it.</p>
    <p>“The big­gest ap­peal is its low stakes. I don’t have to have dis­ci­pline and there are no rules... It al­lows me to laugh at my­self.</p>
    <p>“I’m able to ac­cept small fail­ures in my writ­ing. When I’m judg­men­tal about my work, such as when I am rewriting, I end up writ­ing some­thing that is very sim­i­lar and I get stuck in a loop. Draw­ing makes me feel lib­er­ated from that loop.”</p>
    <p>Draw­ing ab­stract, repet­i­tive shapes with mark­ers or colour pen­cils gets her out of cre­ative ruts in her writ­ing, as well as in dance, an­other pas­sion of hers.</p>
    <p>She stud­ied dance as a mi­nor as an un­der­grad­u­ate in North­west­ern Univer­sity in Illi­nois in the US. She has taken part in pub­lic per­for­mances and en­joys bal­let and con­tem­po­rary dance.</p>
    <p>“Both writ­ing and dance are very tied to my iden­tity, so when I fail, it hits me a lot harder than if I failed in draw­ing.</p>
    <p>“Some­times, I get frus­trated when I fail to cap­ture what I want to ex­press or if I fail to ex­e­cute a move­ment in a dance that I know,” says Mok, who is tak­ing a hia­tus from dance as she re­cently un­der­went surgery for an in­jury.</p>
    <p>Her draw­ings, filled with curves, spi­rals and flow­ing lines, have opened her eyes to con­nec­tions be­tween dif­fer­ent art forms.</p>
    <p>The sense of an ero­sion of bound­aries, which she has some­times felt while draw­ing, is re­flected in her work, where the hy­brid or­chid in her book re­veals var­i­ous aspects of Sin­ga­pore, such as colo­nial­ism, biotech­nol­ogy and mul­tira­cial­ism.</p>
    <p>“These ways of think­ing com­ple­ment and can il­lu­mi­nate one an­other,” says Mok.</p>
