    <p>Many man­u­fac­tur­ers have adopted dig­i­tal so­lu­tions to help them get through the pan­demic. Firms in the sec­tor em­barked on more than 1,300 projects to up­grade and trans­form their busi­nesses with help from En­ter­prise Sin­ga­pore be­tween Jan­uary and Au­gust. This is about 65 per cent up on the num­ber in the same pe­riod last year.</p>
    <p>Work­ers had to fil­let fish by hand at food man­u­fac­turer Hai Sia Seafood, but this la­bo­ri­ous job has been vastly im­proved as the com­pany trans­forms dig­i­tally.</p>
    <p>A new fish fil­let­ing ma­chine has in­creased ca­pac­ity five­fold af­ter staff moved from man­ual labour to learn­ing to op­er­ate the equip­ment.</p>
    <p>Hai Sia is just one of many man­u­fac­tur­ers that have adopted dig­i­tal so­lu­tions to help them get through the coro­n­avirus pan­demic, which has cut the num­ber of peo­ple work­ing on site.</p>
    <p>Firms in the sec­tor em­barked on more than 1,300 projects to up­grade and trans­form their busi­nesses with help from En­ter­prise Sin­ga­pore (ESG) be­tween Jan­uary and Au­gust.</p>
    <p>This is about 65 per cent up on the num­ber in the same pe­riod last year, ESG noted.</p>
    <p>The main ar­eas of fo­cus are in tech­nol­ogy de­ploy­ment and au­toma­tion, process re­design and dig­i­tal­i­sa­tion so­lu­tions, such as hu­man re­source man­age­ment sys­tems.</p>
    <p>ESG ex­ec­u­tive di­rec­tor for man­u­fac­tur­ing and en­gi­neer­ing Si­mon Lim said: “This shows that more Sin­ga­pore man­u­fac­tur­ers are recog­nis­ing the ben­e­fits of In­dus­try 4.0-re­lated so­lu­tions, and are ac­tively tak­ing steps to kick-start or con­tinue with their trans­for­ma­tion plans de­spite the Covid-19 pan­demic.</p>
    <p>“Pre-pan­demic, the man­u­fac­tur­ing sec­tor had al­ready faced the need to man­age costs, the need for skilled man­power, and dis­rup­tions caused by new tech­nolo­gies and ris­ing com­pe­ti­tion.</p>
    <p>“The pan­demic has... ac­cel­er­ated the push for en­ter­prises to re­think the man­age­ment of their man­u­fac­tur­ing op­er­a­tions and work ar­range­ments.”</p>
    <p>Man­u­fac­tur­ing con­trib­utes about 20 per cent to Sin­ga­pore’s econ­omy and em­ploys about 472,000 work­ers.</p>
    <p>It grew about 3.5 per cent year on year in the first six months of this year de­spite the pan­demic, sup­ported by higher out­put in the bio­med­i­cal man­u­fac­tur­ing and pre­ci­sion en­gi­neer­ing clus­ters.</p>
    <p>About 1,000 man­u­fac­tur­ing firms have also joined SGUnited Jobs and Skills pro­grammes, of­fer­ing more than 6,300 jobs, trainee­ships, at­tach­ments and train­ing op­por­tu­ni­ties to lo­cals, ac­cord­ing to the Min­istry of Man­power’s jobs sit­u­a­tion re­port in Au­gust.</p>
    <p>The pan­demic has brought about some chal­lenges for this large sec­tor. Mr Lim noted that safe dis­tanc­ing mea­sures have seen some firms strug­gle to main­tain pro­duc­tiv­ity as they had to keep the num­ber of em­ploy­ees on site to a min­i­mum.</p>
    <p>They also had to di­ver­sify their sources for materials and re­main ag­ile in scal­ing or shift­ing pro­duc­tion bases, due to sup­ply chain dis­rup­tions.</p>
    <p>“Some small and medium-sized en­ter­prises in the man­u­fac­tur­ing sec­tor re­acted very swiftly to im­ple­ment In­dus­try 4.0 so­lu­tions, such as re­mote mon­i­tor­ing, dig­i­tal and au­toma­tion so­lu­tions, to en­able them to per­form ad­min work re­motely and au­to­mate their pro­duc­tion line to in­crease pro­duc­tiv­ity,” he said.</p>
    <p>Firms can start by tak­ing a “bite­sized” ap­proach to build ca­pa­bil­i­ties pro­gres­sively, Mr Lim said. They can start by iden­ti­fy­ing gaps and op­por­tu­ni­ties, be­fore tak­ing dif­fer­ent steps, such as col­lect­ing data from ex­ist­ing equip­ment to im­prove ef­fi­ciency to us­ing man­power bet­ter to scale dig­i­tal ef­forts.</p>
    <p>So­lu­tion providers said they also have been re­ceiv­ing high vol­umes of in­quiries from man­u­fac­tur­ers.</p>
    <p>Dig­i­tal man­u­fac­tur­ing so­lu­tion provider Arc­stone said it has seen five times the usual num­ber of re­quests this year.</p>
    <p>Chief ex­ec­u­tive Will­son Deng said: “By fo­cus­ing on pro­vid­ing vis­i­bil­ity, con­trol and op­ti­mi­sa­tion over a fac­tory floor, we help bring about higher pro­duc­tiv­ity, re­duced wastage and im­proved qual­ity and out­put for man­u­fac­tur­ers.”</p>
    <p>He added that these so­lu­tions can lift pro­duc­tiv­ity de­spite lower head­count and also help staff move to higher-level jobs.</p>
    <p>En­gi­neer­ing firm Hope Tech­nik launched a sys­tem in June to help busi­nesses de­tect peo­ple’s tem­per­a­ture ac­cu­rately and ef­fi­ciently in high foot­fall ar­eas in a cost-ef­fec­tive man­ner.</p>
    <p>Mr Daniel Nia, prod­uct owner of the sys­tem and head of Hope Tech­nik spe­cial projects, said: “Covid-19 has ac­cel­er­ated the need for dis­cern­ing or­gan­i­sa­tions to look for al­ter­na­tives as more and more are re­al­is­ing the need for In­dus­try 4.0 so­lu­tions to en­hance their pro­duc­tiv­ity and pro­cesses.”</p>
    <p>So­lu­tion provider Si­genic said it has re­ceived more in­quiries this year “than ever be­fore”.</p>
    <p>It pro­vides a real-time ma­chine health mon­i­tor­ing sys­tem to firms that manufactur­e semi­con­duc­tor wafers.</p>
    <p>The sys­tem pre­cisely mon­i­tors ma­chin­ery be­hav­iour and pro­vides an early warn­ing of prob­lems to pre­vent firms from suf­fer­ing un­ex­pected shut­downs, pro­duc­tion losses and ma­chine dam­age.</p>
    <p>Chief ex­ec­u­tive Tan Boon Siong said: “Ad­vanced ro­botic man­u­fac­tur­ing tech­niques are a ne­ces­sity, while the ever-re­duc­ing nano size prod­uct man­u­fac­tur­ing is the next cut­ting-edge tech­nol­ogy, re­quir­ing more ac­cu­racy and fault­less re­peata­bil­ity.</p>
    <p>“Against this back­ground, the abil­ity to ef­fec­tively pre­dict and re­solve ma­chin­ery ab­nor­mal­i­ties will be cru­cial in de­ter­min­ing which com­pa­nies will not only be more suc­cess­ful, but which will sur­vive.”</p>
