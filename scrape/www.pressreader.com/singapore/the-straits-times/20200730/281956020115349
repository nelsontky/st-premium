    <p>NEW DELHI • In­dia is pre­par­ing to po­si­tion an ad­di­tional 35,000 troops along its dis­puted Hi­malayan border with China as the pos­si­bil­ity of an early res­o­lu­tion to the deadly ten­sions be­tween the two neigh­bours fades.</p>
    <p>The move would change the sta­tus quo along the con­tested 3,488km Line of Ac­tual Con­trol and stretch the na­tion’s al­ready tight mil­i­tary bud­get, se­nior In­dian of­fi­cials said, ask­ing not to be iden­ti­fied due to rules on speak­ing to the me­dia.</p>
    <p>Twenty In­dian sol­diers and an un­known num­ber of Chi­nese troops were killed in an ugly skir­mish on June 15 and since then, both sides have rushed thou­sands of sol­diers, ar­tillery guns and tanks to the region. With In­dia-China border agree­ments not hold­ing, the sit­u­a­tion re­quired more troops, the of­fi­cials said.</p>
    <p>“Ad­di­tional troops rushed by ei­ther side will not move back un­less there is a rap­proche­ment at the high­est po­lit­i­cal level,” said Mr B.K. Sharma, a re­tired ma­jor-gen­eral and di­rec­tor of Delhi-based think-tank The United Ser­vice In­sti­tu­tion of In­dia.</p>
    <p>For now, the skir­mishes have stopped. And af­ter sev­eral rounds of high-level mil­i­tary talks, Bei­jing said troops were dis­en­gag­ing in most lo­ca­tions.</p>
    <p>The ex­tra de­ploy­ment to eastern Ladakh comes as the In­dian Army is heav­ily com­mit­ted – from pro­tect­ing the 742km dis­puted border with Pak­istan, to counter-in­sur­gency op­er­a­tions in Jammu and Kash­mir and north-eastern states, to mon­i­tor­ing ev­ery ingress point along its border with China.</p>
    <p>In­dia yes­ter­day wel­comed the first five Rafale fighter jets bought from France in a multi­bil­lion-dol­lar deal and De­fence Min­is­ter Ra­j­nath Singh said the jets will make the In­dian Air Force “much stronger to de­ter any threat that may be posed on our coun­try”, in a veiled warn­ing to China.</p>
    <p>Strength­en­ing border de­fences comes at a huge cost and places new pres­sure on the na­tion’s mil­i­tary mod­erni­sa­tion pro­gramme. While New Delhi is the world’s third-big­gest mil­i­tary spender, its air force, navy and army are still equipped with weapons that are largely ob­so­lete.</p>
    <p>About 60 per cent of de­fence spend­ing goes to paying salaries for In­dia’s 1.3 mil­lion sol­diers – one of the world’s largest stand­ing ar­mies.</p>
    <p>The re­main­der is spent on past pur­chases, leav­ing the forces with ob­so­lete equip­ment and not enough am­mu­ni­tion.</p>
    <p>“The ad­di­tional com­mit­ment in Ladakh would put fur­ther pres­sure on ser­vice­abil­ity, re­search and de­vel­op­ment and cap­i­tal ex­pen­di­ture as rev­enue costs rise,” said Dr Lax­man Kumar Be­hera, a se­nior re­search fel­low at the Delhi-based think-tank Manohar Par­rikar In­sti­tute for De­fence Stud­ies and Analy­ses.</p>
    <p>“It will be painful if the de­fence bud­get isn’t in­creased,” he added.</p>
