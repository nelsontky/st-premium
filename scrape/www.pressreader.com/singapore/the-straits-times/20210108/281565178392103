    <p>With com­fort still be­ing key for con­sumers, brands are fit­ting out their stores and pop-ups with homey in­te­ri­ors. Such in­te­ri­ors can “make it eas­ier for cus­tomers to imag­ine or vi­su­alise con­sum­ing the prod­ucts in their own homes, which could fur­ther boost their will­ing­ness to buy”, says one pro­fes­sor.</p>
    <p>Inside lo­cal fra­grance brand Six’s new store, you would be for­given for think­ing you should take your shoes off.</p>
    <p>The bou­tique in the base­ment of 313@som­er­set is styled so cosily, it al­most feels like a home.</p>
    <p>Art in­stal­la­tions fill the space, and a mar­ble ta­ble out front looks perfect for host­ing din­ner par­ties but is re­ally where the brand con­ducts per­fume-mak­ing work­shops.</p>
    <p>Founder Ja­son Lee, 36, spent about $150,000 on ren­o­va­tions to fash­ion a store that would soothe cus­tomers and make them think of fill­ing their own homes with the same scents.</p>
    <p>Three floors above, fast-fash­ion footwear brand Sun­day Sta­ples is set to open its third store next week with the same com­fort aes­thetic.</p>
    <p>Plush booths to try on shoes com­fort­ably and curved lines all around evoke a cafe-like feel.</p>
    <p>“It’s on trend,” says co-founder Mau­rice Bay, 33.</p>
    <p>“The mo­ti­va­tion is to cre­ate a more com­fort­able, al­lur­ing set­ting where you’re drawn to some­thing you can re­late to.”</p>
    <p>In­stead of ramp­ing up e-com­merce, some brands are buck­ing the trend and open­ing new stores and longer-term pop-ups (with a min­i­mum six-month lease).</p>
    <p>They are also go­ing all out on decor, opt­ing for stylish, homey in­te­ri­ors that could make the pages of in­te­rior de­sign magazines.</p>
    <p>Even non-per­ma­nent stores are get­ting the comfy re­tail treat­ment.</p>
    <p>Founder of lo­cal wom­enswear la­bel Klarra, Ms Beatrice Tan, 32, chose a pleas­ing pal­ette of wood and white for her new pop-up, which opened at The Shoppes at Ma­rina Bay Sands last month and will last till June.</p>
    <p>She spent about $50,000 fur­nish­ing the space. Some friends and cus­tomers thought the store was per­ma­nent.</p>
    <p>“A per­ma­nent store is the way to go for ex­po­sure and brand aware­ness, but be­cause of Covid-19, I wasn’t sure about com­mit­ting to a long-term lease, which is usu­ally three years at least,” says Ms Tan, who has a bou­tique at Raf­fles City that opened in end-2018.</p>
    <p>She was on the hunt for leases that were at least six months long, hav­ing done a three-month pop-up at Capi­tol Pi­azza in 2017.</p>
    <p>“Three months is too short, given the ren­o­va­tions. Peo­ple used to think pop-ups are very makeshift, like a lit­tle booth, but nowa­days (the con­cept has) evolved. There is a per­ma­nent store feel and malls ex­pect you to put in more work and insert a bit of store brand­ing,” she says.</p>
    <p>Such longer-term pop-ups have been on the rise in re­cent years.</p>
    <p>Re­tail ex­perts say they may serve as a kind of com­pro­mise so­lu­tion, es­pe­cially for new or emerg­ing brands and re­tail­ers con­sid­er­ing om­nichan­nel mar­ket­ing.</p>
    <p>Na­tional Univer­sity of Sin­ga­pore Busi­ness School’s pro­fes­sor of mar­ket­ing Leonard Lee says such pop-ups al­low brands to build a phys­i­cal iden­tity or cul­ti­vate a pool of reg­u­lar cus­tomers without hav­ing to com­mit to a long-term rental ar­range­ment. The Straits Times un­der­stands that the usual long-term lease agree­ment is for a min­i­mum period of three years.</p>
    <p>“Brands are hence able to stay ag­ile in the rapidly evolv­ing re­tail land­scape. Some may also use it as a way to test the wa­ters on a new re­tail con­cept or brand iden­tity.”</p>
    <p>The home-like at­mos­phere many brands are favour­ing can cre­ate a feel­ing of fa­mil­iar­ity or a gen­eral sense of psy­cho­log­i­cal com­fort, adds Prof Lee, who fore­sees such pop-ups gain­ing ground as the pan­demic sit­u­a­tion eases.</p>
    <p>“Prior re­search has sug­gested that such feel­ings can fos­ter lik­ing for the brand, which can, in turn, trans­late into greater sales.</p>
    <p>“De­pend­ing on the type of prod­ucts be­ing sold, a home-like at­mos­phere can also make it eas­ier for cus­tomers to imag­ine or vi­su­alise con­sum­ing the prod­ucts in their own homes, which could fur­ther boost their will­ing­ness to buy.”</p>
    <p>Ob­serv­ing that more malls have be­come re­cep­tive to longer-term pop-ups in the past year, Ms Tan says they are a good way to test foot traf­fic and build brand aware­ness at a new lo­ca­tion – without too heavy an in­vest­ment.</p>
    <p>The fact that cus­tomers like snap­ping pic­tures of the store to post on so­cial me­dia does not hurt ei­ther. She adds: “We started with e-com­merce, so In­sta­gram­friendly decor was a big con­sid­er­a­tion. The pho­tos can at­tract peo­ple to come by.”</p>
