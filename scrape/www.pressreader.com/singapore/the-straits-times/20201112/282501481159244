    <p>This Tai­wanese ro­man­tic com­edy opens with a mon­tage sum­maris­ing the odd life of Hsiao-chi (Patty Lee), born with an in­ter­nal clock that ticks too quickly.</p>
    <p>In school, she is elim­i­nated from sports com­pe­ti­tions be­cause she has a habit of start­ing be­fore the whis­tle. Now a grown-up, she is about to en­ter her 30s un­touched by ro­mance. Her job at the counter of a post of­fice looks un­likely to net her a com­pan­ion.</p>
    <p>Then a kind and hand­some cus­tomer, Wen­son (Dun­can Chou), chats with her and asks the as­tounded Hsiao-chi for a date on Valen­tine’s Day. She is over­joyed but awak­ens the day af­ter the holiday with no rec­ol­lec­tion of the pre­vi­ous 24 hours. Dis­traught, she digs into why the day that could have changed her life seems to have van­ished.</p>
    <p>Writer-di­rec­tor Chen Yu-hsun has taken bits of his favourite films and as­sem­bled them into a rich, re­ward­ing work.</p>
    <p>Hsiao-chi, a con­flicted woman who is cu­ri­ous but shy, lonely and afraid of con­tact, brings to mind the ti­tle char­ac­ter of French com­edy Amelie (2001). The gen­tle hu­mour is mar­ried to the fan­tas­ti­cal whimsy of Ja­panese anime, seen es­pe­cially in a sec­ond-act dream se­quence in­volv­ing talk­ing an­i­mals.</p>
    <p>This sort of visu­ally am­bi­tious, genre-bend­ing film-mak­ing is rare th­ese days, and even rarer still is its ma­tu­rity of vi­sion and taste­ful­ness. It comes as no sur­prise that it has earned 11 Golden Horse nom­i­na­tions – the most for any film this year – in­clud­ing Best Sound Ef­fects and Best Orig­i­nal Screen­play.</p>
    <p>FREAKY</p>
    <p>Two ver­sions – NC16 and M18 – avail­able, 102 min­utes, opens to­day It be­gan in 2017 with Happy Death Day and the 2019 se­quel Happy Death Day 2U. Both movies, di­rected and co-writ­ten by Amer­i­can film-maker Christo­pher Lan­don, took an iconic story premise – the re­cur­ring day of Ground­hog Day (1993) – then set a killer from a slasher film loose in it.</p>
    <p>The trend car­ries on in Lan­don’s new film, whose ti­tle bears a cheeky nod to the story that gets slasher-ised. Freaky Fri­day is the body-swop com­edy that Dis­ney thrice adapted for the screen, though many other pic­tures have stolen its key idea in part or in whole. For ex­am­ple, the hugely popular anime Your Name (2016) took the switched-minds idea and put it in a ro­mance set dur­ing an apoc­a­lyp­tic event.</p>
    <p>Body-swop pic­tures tend to be moral­ity tales about em­pa­thy – a white racist learns what it feels like to be black, a teen up­set at her mother un­der­stands why the lat­ter is the way she is.</p>
    <p>In Freaky, when bul­lied high-schooler Mil­lie (Kathryn New­ton) switches places with se­rial killer the Bliss­field Butcher (Vince Vaughn), the set-up is ex­ploited for comic thrills rather than life lessons.</p>
    <p>To be sure, there is a lot of fun to be had when Mil­lie, pos­sessed by the mind of a ma­niac, goes from meek to mur­der­ous. It is as if she has gained su­per­pow­ers, a fact her tor­men­tors at school dis­cover too late.</p>
    <p>With two rat­ings avail­able in Sin­ga­pore – NC16 or M18 – view­ers can select the level of cathar­ti­cally vi­o­lent de­light that is right for them.</p>
    <p>Lan­don and com­pany take less care with the flip­side of the pic­ture. Vaughn, as the 1.96m 50-year-old man whose body is taken over by a shy teenage girl, fails to con­vince – due largely to writ­ing that re­lies on con­trivance rather than be­ing driven by char­ac­ter and act­ing. He ends up laps­ing into the kind of minc­ing some men do when they cross-dress.</p>
    <p>MON­SOON</p>
    <p>M18, 86 min­utes, opens to­day</p>
    <p>This at­tempt at de­pict­ing the emo­tional jour­ney of an eth­nic Viet­namese jour­ney­ing from the West to his parental home is turgid when it should have been thought­ful, vague when it should have been con­crete.</p>
    <p>Kit (Bri­tish ac­tor Henry Gold­ing) is in Ho Chi Minh City to scat­ter the ashes of his par­ents, who fled Viet­nam for Bri­tain af­ter the war. He re­con­nects with child­hood friend Lee (David Tran) as well as meets new ones, such as the Amer­i­can Lewis (Parker Sawyers), who be­comes his lover, and lo­cal woman Linh (Molly Har­ris).</p>
    <p>Kit is a tourist, hav­ing been away from Viet­nam as a child. Ev­ery­thing is new to him, yet it is not. He walks in a land of ghosts – of the his­tor­i­cal, cul­tural and per­sonal sort.</p>
    <p>Those ghosts nip at his heels – for ex­am­ple, when he speaks to</p>
    <p>Lee and Linh. Lee is a happy fam­ily man with deep roots in the coun­try while Linh seeks to do right as a tra­di­tional daugh­ter while work­ing to­wards free­doms her mother never en­joyed.</p>
    <p>Bri­tish film-maker Hong Khaou, whose Chi­nese-Cam­bo­dian par­ents set­tled in Bri­tain af­ter es­cap­ing con­flicts in Viet­nam and Cam­bo­dia, makes Kit’s jour­ney one of self-dis­cov­ery – about him­self as a gay man and a son of Asian im­mi­grants liv­ing in the West.</p>
    <p>The story ex­ter­nalises Kit’s in­ter­nal strug­gle in di­a­logue and in wide shots of the pen­sive trav­eller stand­ing alone against the hub­bub of the city, but Khaou’s re­luc­tance to drama­tise the con­flict makes this a slow, frus­trat­ing watch.</p>
    <p>DREAMKATCH­ER</p>
    <p>PG13, 86 min­utes, opens to­day Not re­viewed</p>
    <p>In this work of hor­ror, a woman Gail (Radha Mitchell) mar­ries and gains a step­son, Josh (Fin­lay Wo­j­tak-His­song). He steals an ob­ject of great spir­i­tual power, un­leash­ing de­monic forces in their home.</p>
    <p>HORI­ZON LINE</p>
    <p>NC16, 92 min­utes, opens to­day Not re­viewed Sara (Al­li­son Wil­liams) and Jack­son (Alexan­der Drey­mon) are a cou­ple headed to a des­ti­na­tion wed­ding on a re­mote trop­i­cal is­land on a small char­tered air­plane. When the pi­lot has a heart at­tack, the pas­sen­gers, nei­ther of whom are trained as pi­lots, must take the con­trols or risk crash­ing into the sea.</p>
