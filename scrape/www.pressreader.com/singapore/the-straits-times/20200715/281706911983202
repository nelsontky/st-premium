    <p>In May, a lab­o­ra­tory here de­clared 33 cases as pos­i­tive for Covid-19, but the re­sults were later found to be false. The er­ror was caused by an ap­pa­ra­tus cal­i­bra­tion issue for one of the test kits at the lab be­tween May 5 and 9.</p>
    <p>The cases in­cluded a 43-year-old Sin­ga­porean ra­dio­g­ra­pher at the Sin­ga­pore Expo com­mu­nity care fa­cil­ity.</p>
    <p>Sub­se­quent retest­ing at the Na­tional Pub­lic Health Lab­o­ra­tory con­firmed that the cases were ac­tu­ally neg­a­tive.</p>
    <p>The Min­istry of Health (MOH) also said pre­vi­ously that two other cases that ini­tially had equiv­o­cal re­sults were also retested and found to be neg­a­tive.</p>
    <p>When they had equiv­o­cal test re­sults, they were clas­si­fied as pos­i­tive as a pre­cau­tion and iso­lated.</p>
    <p>No false neg­a­tive re­sults were found, said the MOH.</p>
    <p>Fol­low­ing the in­ci­dent, As­so­ciate Pro­fes­sor Ken­neth Mak, MOH’s di­rec­tor of med­i­cal ser­vices, said on May 12 that ad­vi­sories would be is­sued to all lab­o­ra­to­ries con­duct­ing coro­n­avirus tests to en­sure that test re­sults are ac­cu­rate.</p>
    <p>Prof Mak had said the lab­o­ra­tory that had re­ported false pos­i­tives would “re­cal­i­brate” its test kits and reval­i­date test re­sults.</p>
    <p>This process was ex­pected to take place over a few days, fol­low­ing which Sin­ga­pore would re­turn to its full test­ing ca­pac­ity, he added.</p>
    <p>“To safe­guard this par­tic­u­lar process of qual­ity as­sur­ance and to make sure we avoid hav­ing false pos­i­tive re­sults com­ing out in the fu­ture, we have put to­gether some ad­vi­sories and guid­ance for all the labs in­volved in test­ing,” he said.</p>
