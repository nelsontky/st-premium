    <p>WASHINGTON • A for­mer lead­ing fund-raiser for US Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump has been in­dicted on a charge that he il­le­gally lob­bied the United States gov­ern­ment to drop its probe into the 1Malaysia De­vel­op­ment Ber­had (1MDB) cor­rup­tion scan­dal and to de­port an ex­iled Chi­nese bil­lion­aire.</p>
    <p>El­liott Broidy was charged in fed­eral court with one count of con­spir­acy to act as an un­reg­is­tered for­eign agent af­ter al­legedly agree­ing to take mil­lions of dol­lars to lobby the Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion.</p>
    <p>The in­dict­ment, made pub­lic on Thurs­day, said Broidy was re­cruited in 2017 by an un­named for­eign na­tional, un­der­stood to be Malaysian Low Taek Jho, to pres­sure US of­fi­cials to end their in­ves­ti­ga­tion of a scan­dal en­gulf­ing then Malaysian Prime Min­is­ter Na­jib Razak.</p>
    <p>The scan­dal in­volved the theft of over US$4.5 bil­lion (S$6 bil­lion) from 1MDB, and fugi­tive Low was cen­tral to mov­ing and hid­ing some of the stolen funds.</p>
    <p>At the time, Broidy was na­tional deputy fi­nance chair­man of the Repub­li­can Na­tional Com­mit­tee af­ter hav­ing been a ma­jor fund-raiser for Mr Trump’s 2016 cam­paign.</p>
    <p>Af­ter be­ing re­cruited by Low, Broidy per­son­ally asked Mr Trump to in­vite Na­jib to play golf dur­ing the Malaysian leader’s Septem­ber 2017 visit to the US, the in­dict­ment said. The goal was to give Na­jib a chance “to at­tempt to re­solve the 1MDB mat­ter” with the US leader, the doc­u­ment said. The golf game never hap­pened, and Low was in­dicted in 2018 for his role in si­phon­ing bil­lions from 1MDB.</p>
    <p>In ad­di­tion, in May 2017, Low in­tro­duced Broidy to a Chi­nese state min­is­ter, and they dis­cussed Bei­jing’s de­sire that Washington de­port an ex­iled Chi­nese ty­coon, the in­dict­ment said.</p>
    <p>It did not name ei­ther per­son, but the ty­coon is known to be prom­i­nent dis­si­dent busi­ness­man Guo Wen­gui. Ac­cord­ing to The Wall Street Jour­nal, the Chi­nese of­fi­cial was Mr Sun Li­jun, for­mer vice-min­is­ter of pub­lic se­cu­rity.</p>
    <p>The in­dict­ment de­scribes Broidy’s in­tense lob­by­ing of the White House, the Justice De­part­ment and law en­force­ment on be­half of the Chi­nese, in­clud­ing con­tacts with, but not di­rect dis­cus­sions with, Mr Trump.</p>
    <p>The ob­ject, the in­dict­ment said, was “to make mil­lions of dol­lars by lever­ag­ing Broidy’s ac­cess to and per­ceived in­flu­ence with the Pres­i­dent and his ad­min­is­tra­tion”.</p>
