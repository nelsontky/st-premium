    <p>One death at the work­place is one too many (Bangladesh­i worker dies in ac­ci­dent at LTA con­struc­tion site, Dec 16).</p>
    <p>Five work­place deaths in a span of two weeks be­tween late last month and early this month, as in­di­cated in the ar­ti­cle, is un­think­able.</p>
    <p>I once worked with a large and rep­utable con­struc­tion com­pany that prided it­self on its safety stan­dards, claim­ing safety awards, mostly gold, year af­ter year. The walls in its of­fice were lined with these awards.</p>
    <p>The com­pany’s safety of­fi­cers took their job very se­ri­ously and were con­stantly on the move. Safety at such a work­place was more than just wear­ing safety boots, a re­flec­tive vest, a hel­met and a safety belt.</p>
    <p>Hav­ing been well equipped for the work at hand, the of­fi­cers had to en­sure that the labour­ers were well pre­pared, men­tally and phys­i­cally, for the job.</p>
    <p>Af­ter ev­ery death, the labour move­ment will urge all com­pa­nies to prioritise and safe­guard the safety of their work­ers. Are there no other more mean­ing­ful ways to urge the com­pa­nies to com­ply with es­tab­lished codes and stop such pre­ventable, tragic loss of lives?</p>
    <p>They should be given a hefty penalty and barred from fur­ther ten­ders for a cer­tain pe­riod for just a sin­gle death recorded at their work­sites.</p>
    <p>Let all our for­eign con­struc­tion work­ers work and en­joy life here, and be able to re­turn home safely to their fam­i­lies.</p>
