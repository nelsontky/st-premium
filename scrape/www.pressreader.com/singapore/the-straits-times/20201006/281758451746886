    <p>Mi­cro and small com­pa­nies that re­quire sup­port to re­struc­ture their debts or wind up their busi­nesses may soon be able to do so in a quicker and lower-cost man­ner.</p>
    <p>A Sim­pli­fied In­sol­vency Pro­gramme, which would pro­vide such sup­port to com­pa­nies, was part of the In­sol­vency, Re­struc­tur­ing and Dis­so­lu­tion (Amend­ment) Bill in­tro­duced in Par­lia­ment yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore’s cur­rent in­sol­vency laws gen­er­ally pro­vide pro­cesses for com­pa­nies with sub­stan­tial as­sets, which may not be well suited for dis­tressed smaller com­pa­nies.</p>
    <p>The pro­posed pro­gramme will pro­vide more suit­able so­lu­tions for such com­pa­nies, par­tic­u­larly those that have de­pleted their re­sources as a re­sult of the Covid-19 pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Mi­cro and small busi­nesses have an­nual rev­enue of less than $1 mil­lion and $10 mil­lion re­spec­tively. There were more than 251,000 of them in 2018, of which around 207,000 were mi­cro en­ter­prises.</p>
    <p>Qual­i­fy­ing cri­te­ria for the pro­gramme in­clude hav­ing 30 or fewer em­ploy­ees, 50 or fewer cred­i­tors and li­a­bil­i­ties of $2 mil­lion or less, among oth­ers, said the Min­istry of Law (MinLaw) in a state­ment.</p>
    <p>Among the stream­lined and ex­pe­dited pro­cesses mooted for firms’ debt re­struc­tur­ing is a lower cred­i­tor ap­proval thresh­old than re­quired in a typ­i­cal scheme of ar­range­ment.</p>
    <p>This means that only cred­i­tors with debt claims to­talling twothirds in value agree­ing to the scheme are re­quired, com­pared with more than 50 per cent of the num­ber of cred­i­tors hold­ing at least 75 per cent in value of debt claims agree­ing to the scheme.</p>
    <p>For busi­nesses which are no longer vi­able, the sim­pli­fied wind­ing-up process in­cludes a re­duced scope of the liq­uida­tor’s func­tions.</p>
    <p>For ex­am­ple, there will be no need to con­vene cred­i­tors’ meet­ings, and the liq­uida­tor may only be­gin le­gal pro­ceed­ings to pre­serve the rights of the com­pany.</p>
    <p>In ad­di­tion, if the liq­uida­tor views the com­pany’s as­sets to be in­suf­fi­cient to meet the ex­penses of wind­ing up and that its af­fairs do not need fur­ther in­ves­ti­ga­tion, the com­pany may then be dis­solved with­out fur­ther ad­min­is­tra­tive steps.</p>
    <p>The pro­gramme will be avail­able for six months from the start of the pro­posed leg­is­la­tion, and may be ex­tended for a pe­riod de­ter­mined by the min­is­ter. Firms will have to co­pay for the pro­gramme, and fees will be an­nounced later.</p>
    <p>The Sim­pli­fied In­sol­vency Pro­gramme is part of other sup­port mea­sures to help busi­nesses that are fac­ing fi­nan­cial chal­lenges, MinLaw said.</p>
    <p>Com­ple­ment­ing the pro­gramme is a re­lief scheme that will help sole pro­pri­etors and part­ner­ships re­struc­ture business debts. It will be ready for ap­pli­ca­tion by Nov 2.</p>
    <p>The scheme will be ad­min­is­tered by Credit Coun­selling Sin­ga­pore, with the sup­port of The As­so­ci­a­tion of Banks in Sin­ga­pore, the Mon­e­tary Authority of Sin­ga­pore, En­ter­prise Sin­ga­pore (ESG) and par­tic­i­pat­ing fi­nan­cial in­sti­tu­tions un­der ESG loan schemes. More de­tails will be an­nounced at a later date.</p>
