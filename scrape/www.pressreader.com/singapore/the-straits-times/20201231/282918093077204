    <p>IN­STA­GRAM QUEEN:</p>
    <p>In­sta­gram has un­veiled its most-liked pho­tos of the year and Kylie Jen­ner has come up tops.</p>
    <p>The 23-year-old re­al­ity-tele­vi­sion star of Keep­ing Up With The Kar­dashi­ans (2007 to present) shared four of the top 10 pho­tos.</p>
    <p>One was of her daugh­ter Stormi Web­ster sur­rounded by foam in the bath, while an­other fea­tured mother and daugh­ter sweetly cud­dling on the couch (above). Her ex-boyfriend Travis Scott ap­peared in two other posts, one with her and an­other with Stormi, who is his daugh­ter, on his birth­day.</p>
    <p>The cap­tion on the birth­day post, which was Jen­ner’s top post with close to 16 mil­lion likes, read: “Happy birth­day to daddy of the year! I’m slowly but surely start­ing to ac­cept the fact that Storm is a daddy’s girl.”</p>
    <p>In to­tal, those four posts gar­nered more than 60 mil­lion likes, mak­ing Jen­ner the most-liked Kar­dashian, at least on In­sta­gram.</p>
    <p>How­ever, the most pop­u­lar photo of the year was of foot­ball star Cris­tiano Ron­aldo with the leg­endary Diego Maradona, which had 19.6 mil­lion likes. It was posted after Maradona’s death on</p>
    <p>Nov 25 at the age of 60.</p>
    <p>The sec­ond most-liked post with more than 19 mil­lion likes was the one an­nounc­ing the death of Chad­wick Bose­man on Aug 28. The Black Pan­ther ac­tor, 43, died of colon cancer, which he had not made public.</p>
    <p>Maradona made an ap­pear­ance again in third place in a photo with fel­low Ar­gen­tinian foot­baller Lionel Messi.</p>
    <p>Oth­ers in the top 10 in­clude bas­ket­ball stars LeBron James and the late Kobe Bryant.</p>
