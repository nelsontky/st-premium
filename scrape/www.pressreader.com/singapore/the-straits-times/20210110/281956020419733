    <p>Hav­ing spent more than eight years in the build­ing and con­struc­tion in­dus­try, Mr Chua Khiong Kiat has no­ticed ar­eas which can be im­proved upon. For ex­am­ple, many pro­cesses can be au­to­mated us­ing sys­tems and tech­nol­ogy.</p>
    <p>The 30-year-old hopes to cre­ate a start-up to pro­vide IT so­lu­tions for the in­dus­try. But be­fore that, he needs to go back to school.</p>
    <p>Two years ago, he com­pleted a master’s in civil en­gi­neer­ing at the Na­tional Univer­sity of Singapore. In Fe­bru­ary last year, Mr Chua re­turned to pur­sue a Grad­u­ate Diploma in Sys­tems Anal­y­sis (GDipSA) at NUS-ISS (In­sti­tute of Sys­tems Science at Na­tional Univer­sity of Singapore).</p>
    <p>The one-year full-time pro­gramme is de­signed for non-IT grad­u­ates who in­tend to pur­sue a new ca­reer in the IT in­dus­try, as well as cur­rent IT pro­fes­sion­als who want to stay rel­e­vant with the lat­est knowl­edge and skills. It in­cludes a five-month com­pany in­tern­ship, where stu­dents can ap­ply their tech­ni­cal skills and do­main knowl­edge in a real work set­ting.</p>
    <p>Un­for­tu­nately, Mr Chua’s co­hort was af­fected by the Covid-19 pan­demic. There were three days of lec­tures on cam­pus, while the rest of the pro­gramme was con­ducted vir­tu­ally. Mr Chua took the chal­lenges in his stride, say­ing he found the ex­pe­ri­ence in­ter­est­ing. He also be­lieves on­line learn­ing has its ben­e­fits, such as en­abling stu­dents to speak up more freely dur­ing classes.</p>
    <p>Mr Chua is cur­rently on an in­tern­ship at the Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine. He and his team­mate have been as­signed to re­vamp an out­dated web-based data col­lec­tion sys­tem.</p>
    <p>His tasks in­clude gath­er­ing user re­quire­ments, and propos­ing and de­vel­op­ing fea­si­ble IT so­lu­tions — new skills which the non-IT grad­u­ate has picked up in his post­grad­u­ate pro­gramme and will prove use­ful when he sets up his own IT so­lu­tions firm one day.</p>
