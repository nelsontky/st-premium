    <p>A man told his 11-year-old daugh­ter to con­sume sleep­ing pills af­ter he had a dis­pute with his es­tranged wife in April 2018.</p>
    <p>A dis­trict court heard that he wanted to show the woman that their mar­i­tal dis­putes had caused the girl to feel stressed. He also wanted his wife to feel that she was at fault for not tak­ing proper care of their child.</p>
    <p>The girl com­plied and ended up los­ing con­scious­ness. She was warded in KK Women’s and Chil­dren’s Hos­pi­tal (KKH) for more than a month.</p>
    <p>The man later told the girl to lie to the po­lice and say she had vol­un­tar­ily con­sumed the pills as she wanted to kill her­self.</p>
    <p>Again, the girl com­plied. But four months later, she told the truth to a so­cial worker.</p>
    <p>The 40-year-old Sin­ga­porean man, who can­not be named ow­ing to a gag or­der to pro­tect his daugh­ter’s iden­tity, pleaded guilty in court on Wed­nes­day to one count each of ill-treat­ing a child and in­ten­tion­ally per­vert­ing the course of jus­tice. He also ad­mit­ted to an un­re­lated ha­rass­ment charge.</p>
    <p>Deputy Public Pros­e­cu­tor Joshua Phang said that the man lived with his daugh­ter in a Toa Payoh flat. His wife lived in an­other flat in Wood­lands.</p>
    <p>On April 7, 2018, the girl sent her mother a text mes­sage as she felt un­well and asked the woman to pick her up from Toa Payoh to see a doc­tor. The woman told the girl to take a taxi to Wood­lands, as she did not want to meet the man.</p>
    <p>The girl then de­cided to stay home with her younger brother and pa­ter­nal grand­mother. The man phoned his wife that evening and they quar­relled.</p>
    <p>The girl was in the liv­ing room around mid­night when her fa­ther told her to re­trieve a bot­tle of her grand­mother’s sleep­ing pills.</p>
    <p>He then told her to con­sume some of the med­i­ca­tion and she com­plied. When the girl lost con­scious­ness, the man took her in a taxi to his wife’s flat and called for an am­bu­lance when they were on their way there.</p>
    <p>He laid the girl down out­side his wife’s home and knocked on the door around 3.45am.</p>
    <p>When his wife opened the door, he told the woman that she would be “an­swer­able if any­thing hap­pened to the vic­tim”. An am­bu­lance ar­rived soon af­ter and rushed the girl to KKH.</p>
    <p>The man later vis­ited his daugh­ter in hos­pi­tal and told her to lie to the po­lice about the sit­u­a­tion.</p>
    <p>As in­structed, the girl lied to Sergeant Dick­son Lek on April 18, 2018, claim­ing that she had wanted to take her own life. The man will be sen­tenced on Dec 9.</p>
