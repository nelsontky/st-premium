    <p>South Korea’s anti-virus mea­sures will be put to the test as some 493,000 stu­dents take the an­nual make-or-break col­lege en­trance exam to­day.</p>
    <p>The au­thor­i­ties are on high alert to help make the eight-hour exam as smooth and safe as pos­si­ble, amid con­cerns over a twoweek surge in coro­n­avirus in­fec­tions, in­clud­ing clus­ters at cram schools for high-school se­niors.</p>
    <p>The Col­lege Scholas­tic Abil­ity Test (CSAT) is so im­por­tant that pub­lic of­fices, banks and stock mar­kets will open an hour later to en­sure smooth morn­ing traf­fic for stu­dents.</p>
    <p>Among this year’s test-tak­ers are 37 Covid-19 pa­tients in hos­pi­tals, and 430 in quar­an­tine, who will travel by pri­vate car or am­bu­lance to spe­cial test cen­tres.</p>
    <p>Health au­thor­i­ties said they have taken ex­tra pre­cau­tions to en­sure all stu­dents can take CSAT safely. Strict pro­to­cols are in place at more than 1,300 test sites, such as fever checks, spaced-out desks with plas­tic di­viders and mask wearing.</p>
    <p>Stu­dents who dis­play symp­toms will take the exam in a sep­a­rate iso­la­tion room, with an in­vig­i­la­tor in pro­tec­tive gear.</p>
    <p>Seoul also launched a task force to in­spect some 1,800 places fre­quented by CSAT stu­dents, such as cram schools and In­ter­net cafes, to en­sure that anti-virus rules were fol­lowed.</p>
    <p>An of­fi­cial from Seoul’s ed­u­ca­tion of­fice told The Straits Times that one major chal­lenge was se­cur­ing more test sites and in­vig­i­la­tors as the num­ber of test-tak­ers per room was re­duced from 28 to 24, but “for­tu­nately, schools and teach­ers in Seoul have been very co­op­er­a­tive”.</p>
    <p>South Korean Pres­i­dent Moon Jae-in cheered the stu­dents on, not­ing that “it is hard enough to pre­pare for CSAT, (it’s) tougher and more wor­ri­some to take the exam dur­ing the coro­n­avirus out­break”.</p>
    <p>He tweeted: “I’d like to put warm scarves around your necks. All of us are sup­port­ing you. Be con­fi­dent. Be calm.”</p>
    <p>De­spite tight­en­ing anti-virus mea­sures such as clos­ing sau­nas and ban­ning high-risk in­door ex­er­cises such as aer­o­bics, South Korea has yet to bring down the num­ber of in­fec­tions sig­nif­i­cantly.</p>
    <p>The coun­try re­ported 511 new cases yes­ter­day. This brings its to­tal to 35,163 cases, with the death toll at 526.</p>
    <p>The surge in cases, at­trib­uted to com­mu­nity out­breaks na­tion­wide, has sent jit­ters among CSAT tak­ers, many of whom took to so­cial me­dia to voice con­cerns.</p>
    <p>One tweeted: “I’m study­ing at home but I’m wor­ried I can­not fo­cus.” Another feared that the exam, de­layed from last month, would be post­poned again.</p>
    <p>House­wife Jung In-ja, whose son is tak­ing CSAT, said this year’s stu­dents are dis­ad­van­taged by dis­rup­tions caused by Covid-19. “Be­tween bouts of re­mote learn­ing and in-school lessons, they have been hin­dered by lack of con­sis­tency and con­cen­tra­tion,” she noted.</p>
    <p>Ms Park Yu­jin, who runs a small cram school in Seoul cater­ing to about 20 high-school se­niors, said most pre­fer to study with her af­ter school hours than go home, where there are too many dis­trac­tions. Only four of them had opted for on­line learn­ing.</p>
    <p>“We joke that we are afraid of Covid-19 but we are more afraid of fail­ing ex­ams,” she told ST.</p>
    <p>She said only half her stu­dents are well pre­pared while the rest seem re­signed to re­tak­ing the exam next year. “I feel sorry for them,” she said.</p>
