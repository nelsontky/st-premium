    <p>He has scaled Ever­est and run ul­tra­ma­rathons through the Ama­zon and across the Gobi desert, and some might say Lien Choong Luen’s next chal­lenge will be equally oner­ous.</p>
    <p>The 43-year-old gen­eral man­ager of ride-hailing firm Go­jek yes­ter­day an­nounced his in­ten­tion to con­test the Sin­ga­pore Ath­let­ics (SA) elec­tions, which are set to take place on Sept 25.</p>
    <p>He will lead a slate of nine called “Team Ground Up”, which in­cludes for­mer na­tional sprinter Gary Yeo. Their pledge: “To re­store co­he­sion and build strong ties across the ath­let­ics com­mu­nity in Sin­ga­pore.”</p>
    <p>SA has been be­set by controvers­y over the last five years, court­ing neg­a­tive head­lines be­cause of le­gal let­ters, leaked What­sApp chats ap­pear­ing to show plots against coaches and high-pro­file dis­putes be­tween lead­ing ath­letes.</p>
    <p>Lien, a mem­ber of the Sin­ga­pore Masters Track and Field As­so­ci­a­tion, said he and his team were “clear-eyed” about the prob­lems that have hit the be­lea­guered as­so­ci­a­tion, but added that his de­sire to see the sport rise again was the main rea­son for want­ing to step into the hot seat.</p>
    <p>“Over the past two years, the ac­ri­mony has be­come ex­treme,” he said, not­ing sev­eral le­gal is­sues that SA has be­come em­broiled in dur­ing that time.</p>
    <p>“We bring a new team, a new be­gin­ning, and a clean slate. And I feel we also present... the best op­por­tu­nity to re­set the long-stand­ing griev­ances that are now there (within the sport).”</p>
    <p>Lien and his team could face a chal­lenge dur­ing the elec­tions, and he added that, if voted in, his pri­or­ity would be to re­solve all out­stand­ing le­gal is­sues that have af­fected SA, with im­prov­ing trans­parency and ac­count­abil­ity also high on his agenda.</p>
    <p>He has been with Go­jek since Fe­bru­ary last year. Be­fore that, he served in the mil­i­tary for 14 years, where he was a for­mer com­mando of­fi­cer, and then spent five years as a strat­egy con­sul­tant lead­ing the McKin­sey Cen­tre for Gov­ern­ment (South-east Asia), serv­ing clients in the tech­nol­ogy and con­sumer in­dus­tries.</p>
    <p>A for­mer schools 800m run­ner and na­tional ju­nior squash player, he also pre­vi­ously served in other na­tional sports as­so­ci­a­tions – as a com­mit­tee mem­ber of Triathlon Sin­ga­pore from 2005-2007, and then as as­sis­tant hon­orary sec­re­tary of the Sin­ga­pore Squash Rack­ets As­so­ci­a­tion from 2008-2010.</p>
    <p>Aside from get­ting SA’s house in or­der, Lien also hopes to build a frame­work which will lead to “longer-term high per­for­mance tar­gets and goals”.</p>
    <p>When asked if he hoped the sport could de­liver medals at the re­gional and con­ti­nen­tal lev­els dur­ing his ten­ure if elected, he said: “What we want to de­liver is a process, rather than spe­cific out­puts.”</p>
    <p>He added that this could come through solv­ing the as­so­ci­a­tion’s in­ter­nal gov­er­nance is­sues and align­ing the plans of na­tional ath­letes with those of na­tional sports agency Sport Sin­ga­pore. “There are about 45 medals at stake in ath­let­ics, and at the last SEA Games, we won three (bronzes).</p>
    <p>“I don’t want to crit­i­cise the (cur­rent) com­mit­tee or ath­letes. I want us to be more com­pet­i­tive across a broader swathe of events... (and) give more rea­sons for Sin­ga­pore­ans to tune in to the fi­nals. If you can win, even bet­ter.”</p>
    <p>Lien’s slate fea­tures Yeo, a for­mer SA ath­letes com­mis­sion rep­re­sen­ta­tive who re­signed from his role in March.</p>
    <p>He will run for the post of vi­cepres­i­dent (train­ing and se­lec­tion).</p>
    <p>The other two vice-pres­i­den­tial can­di­dates are vet­eran of­fi­cial Joe Yap (com­pe­ti­tions) and DBS data an­a­lyst Marinda Teo (fi­nance and part­ner­ship).</p>
    <p>In their me­dia re­lease, the team said: “With this slate of pro­fes­sion­als who have both pas­sion for the sport as well as deep ex­pe­ri­ence in run­ning high-per­for­mance or­gan­i­sa­tions, their com­bined ex­per­tise will help the team bring ath­let­ics to new heights.”</p>
