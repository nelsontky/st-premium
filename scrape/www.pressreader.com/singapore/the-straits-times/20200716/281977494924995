    <p>BRIS­TOL (Bri­tain) • A statue of a slave trader top­pled by anti-racism pro­test­ers in Bri­tain last month was re­placed yes­ter­day – with­out per­mis­sion – with a sculp­ture of a black woman who helped pull it down.</p>
    <p>The new statue, show­ing Black Lives Mat­ter (BLM) pro­tester Jen Reid with her fist raised, oc­cu­pies the plinth where the Ed­ward Col­ston like­ness stood be­fore crowds threw it into Bris­tol har­bour in south-west Eng­land. Ti­tled A Surge Of Power (Jen Reid) 2020, the new statue by Bri­tish artist Marc Quinn was erected with­out the knowl­edge of the Bris­tol City Coun­cil.</p>
    <p>Ms Reid at­tended the un­veil­ing and told The Guardian news­pa­per that it was “just in­cred­i­ble”.</p>
    <p>“This is go­ing to con­tinue the con­ver­sa­tion. I can’t see it com­ing down in a hurry,” she said.</p>
    <p>The lo­cal author­ity had said pre­vi­ously that any de­ci­sion to re­place the Col­ston statue would be taken lo­cally, a view re­in­forced by Bris­tol mayor Marvin Rees yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>“The sculp­ture that has been in­stalled to­day was the work and de­ci­sion of a Lon­don-based artist. It was not re­quested and per­mis­sion was not given for it to be in­stalled,” he said in a state­ment.</p>
    <p>The coun­cil an­nounced last month that it will set up a com­mis­sion to dis­cover the “true his­tory” of Bris­tol, one of the Bri­tish cities most promi­nently in­volved in the slave trade. Col­ston’s statue had oc­cu­pied the plinth since 1895 be­fore be­ing taken down by BLM pro­test­ers who took to the streets fol­low­ing the po­lice killing of an un­armed African Amer­i­can man, Mr Ge­orge Floyd, in the US state of Min­nesota in May.</p>
    <p>Mr Floyd’s death helped fuel global protests, in­clud­ing in Bri­tain where much of the fo­cus has been on its colo­nial past. Col­ston was a 17th cen­tury slave trader and Con­ser­va­tive MP whose com­pany forcibly moved large num­bers of West Africans.</p>
    <p>Since the march in Bris­tol, there have been calls for other stat­ues to be taken down, in­clud­ing that of colo­nial­ist Ce­cil Rhodes at Oxford Univer­sity’s Oriel Col­lege.</p>
