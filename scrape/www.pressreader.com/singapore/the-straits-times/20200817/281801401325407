    <p>WASH­ING­TON • US Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump said he could ex­ert pres­sure on more Chi­nese com­pa­nies, such as tech­nol­ogy giant Alibaba, after he moved to ban TikTok.</p>
    <p>Asked at a news con­fer­ence on Satur­day if there were other China-owned com­pa­nies on which he was con­sid­er­ing a ban, such as Alibaba, he replied: “Well, we’re look­ing at other things, yes.”</p>
    <p>Mr Trump has been pil­ing pres­sure on Chi­nese-owned com­pa­nies, in­clud­ing by vow­ing to ban short-video app TikTok from the United States.</p>
    <p>He or­dered TikTok’s Chi­nese owner ByteDance on Fri­day to di­vest the US op­er­a­tions of TikTok within 90 days, in the lat­est ef­fort to ramp up pres­sure over con­cerns about the safety of the per­sonal data the plat­form han­dles.</p>
    <p>He now has a ver­i­fied ac­count on TikTok ri­val Triller, in an­other sign of the White House’s dis­favour to­wards the Chi­nese videoshar­ing app.</p>
    <p>Triller is one of sev­eral TikTok al­ter­na­tives that have ex­pe­ri­enced a surge of down­loads since Mr Trump signed an ex­ec­u­tive or­der on Aug 6 to pro­hibit cer­tain trans­ac­tions with TikTok un­less ByteDance di­vests it.</p>
    <p>TikTok is best known for its vi­ral dance videos that cap­ture the Amer­i­can teenage zeit­geist, but US of­fi­cials have ex­pressed con­cerns that user data could be passed by the Chi­nese-owned app to the au­thor­i­ties in Bei­jing.</p>
    <p>ByteDance is al­ready in talks to sell TikTok’s North Amer­i­can, Aus­tralian and New Zealand op­er­a­tions to Mi­crosoft.</p>
    <p>With the plat­form un­der a cloud, its once-ob­scure com­peti­tors are step­ping up their ef­forts to woo its young user base.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump’s Triller ac­count had three short videos and a lit­tle more than 3,000 fol­low­ers on Satur­day.</p>
    <p>The Trump cam­paign and Triller did not im­me­di­ately re­spond to re­quests for com­ment.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump, who has made chang­ing the US-China trade re­la­tion­ship a cen­tral theme of his pres­i­dency, has been sharply crit­i­cal of China while also prais­ing its pur­chases of agri­cul­ture prod­ucts such as soya beans and corn as part of a trade agree­ment reached late last year.</p>
