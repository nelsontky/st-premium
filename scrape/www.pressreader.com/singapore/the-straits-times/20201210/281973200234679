    <p>In late Oc­to­ber, the Chi­nese gov­ern­ment an­nounced its eco­nomic and so­cial de­vel­op­ment plans for the next five years and a vi­sion for 2035 that in­cluded build­ing tech­no­log­i­cal self-re­liance and be­com­ing a world leader in in­no­va­tion by that year.</p>
    <p>Last month, Vice-Premier Liu He, who led the draft­ing of the plans, in an ar­ti­cle in the Peo­ple’s Daily called for the coun­try to move faster to­wards be­com­ing tech­no­log­i­cally self-suf­fi­cient, say­ing this and in­no­va­tion are key to China’s de­vel­op­ment.</p>
    <p>Af­ter decades of be­ing the fac­tory of the world that helped to lift mil­lions out of poverty, China’s eco­nomic growth is slow­ing. The coun­try needs to move up the value chain to keep grow­ing and es­cape the mid­dle in­come trap.</p>
    <p>In­deed, in the last decade or more, as fac­to­ries mak­ing prod­ucts such as toys, cam­eras and per­sonal com­put­ers re­lo­cated to lower-cost coun­tries such as Viet­nam and Cam­bo­dia, China has been in­vest­ing in tech­nol­ogy. It has made great strides in ar­eas of tech­nol­ogy such as ar­ti­fi­cial in­tel­li­gence, robotics and telecom­mu­ni­ca­tions.</p>
    <p>But in re­cent years, the West, in par­tic­u­lar the United States, has be­gun push­ing back, un­happy with what it sees as China’s use of less than scrupu­lous tac­tics, such as forced tech­nol­ogy trans­fer and in­tel­lec­tual prop­erty theft, to ac­quire tech­nol­ogy from the West.</p>
    <p>The US is also wary of China’s tech­no­log­i­cal progress as it sees China as a strate­gic com­peti­tor whose au­thor­i­tar­ian sys­tem dif­fers from the US’ demo­cratic one.</p>
    <p>In re­sponse, the US has started to de­cou­ple tech­no­log­i­cally from the Asian gi­ant, while other Western coun­tries have be­come more cau­tious in deal­ing with China when it comes to ad­vanced tech­nol­ogy.</p>
    <p>For ex­am­ple, the US has sought to un­der­mine Chi­nese telecom­mu­ni­ca­tions gi­ant Huawei’s lead­ing po­si­tion in 5G tech­nol­ogy by ban­ning the sale of mi­crochips to the firm, and the sale of equip­ment to make those chips to top Chi­nese chip­maker SMIC.</p>
    <p>Such de­cou­pling ef­forts have led to China dou­bling down on its quest to at­tain tech­no­log­i­cal self-suf­fi­ciency and in­no­va­tive ex­cel­lence.</p>
    <p>This quest had its be­gin­nings in the mid-2000s when China had sought tech­no­log­i­cal self-suf­fi­ciency as a way to strengthen its own in­no­va­tive ca­pac­ity. The dif­fer­ence with the call now is that it is also a re­sponse to the chang­ing and more hos­tile ex­ter­nal en­vi­ron­ment.</p>
    <p>As Mr Liu said in his ar­ti­cle, “Faced with new con­tra­dic­tions and chal­lenges brought about by changes in the ex­ter­nal en­vi­ron­ment, we must ad­just the path of eco­nomic de­vel­op­ment” to one that was more au­tonomous, sus­tain­able and re­silient.</p>
    <p>China is will­ing to throw money into tech­nol­ogy – spend­ing on re­search and de­vel­op­ment (R&D) is ex­pected to rise to 3 per cent of its gross do­mes­tic prod­uct from 2.23 per cent last year – and it is not short of tal­ent among its 1.4 bil­lion pop­u­la­tion. But the less friendly ex­ter­nal en­vi­ron­ment and in­ter­nal is­sues pose chal­lenges to its quest.</p>
    <p>PLAY­ING CATCH-UP</p>
    <p>Even as China em­barked on in­dus­tri­al­i­sa­tion in the 1990s, for­eign firms in in­dus­tries such as cars, elec­tron­ics and phar­ma­ceu­ti­cals were re­quired to form joint-ven­ture com­pa­nies with lo­cal firms when set­ting up op­er­a­tions in China, to fa­cil­i­tate the trans­fer of tech­nol­ogy.</p>
    <p>In the 2000s, how­ever, China be­gan to pro­mote in­dige­nous in­no­va­tion as a way to catch up with the West in science and tech­nol­ogy. As then Pres­i­dent Jiang Zemin said in 1999: “In to­day’s world, the core of each coun­try’s com­pet­i­tive strength is in­tel­lec­tual in­no­va­tion, tech­no­log­i­cal in­no­va­tion and high-tech in­dus­tri­al­i­sa­tion.”</p>
    <p>Un­der Mr Jiang’s suc­ces­sor Hu</p>
    <p>Jin­tao, a pro­gramme was drawn up in 2006 to pro­mote in­dige­nous in­no­va­tion which was ti­tled Na­tional Medium- And</p>
    <p>Long-Term Plan For The De­vel­op­ment of Science and Tech­nol­ogy (2006-2020). It ac­knowl­edged that “de­spite the size of our econ­omy, our coun­try is not an eco­nomic power, pri­mar­ily be­cause of our weak in­no­va­tive ca­pac­ity”.</p>
    <p>Apart from in­creased gov­ern­ment spend­ing on science and tech­nol­ogy and new poli­cies to en­cour­age R&D, gov­ern­ment reg­u­la­tions were put in place to pro­tect lo­cal tech in­dus­tries, a move some schol­ars saw as signs of “techno-na­tion­al­ism”.</p>
    <p>In re­sponse to the rapidly chang­ing tech­no­log­i­cal en­vi­ron­ment, how­ever, this “go-it-alone” techno-na­tion­al­is­tic strat­egy was later re­placed with one that fo­cused on the pur­suit of tech­no­log­i­cal al­liances and em­bed­ded­ness in the global tech ecosys­tem. This new strat­egy would com­bine in­dige­nous in­no­va­tion with col­lab­o­ra­tion with for­eign firms.</p>
    <p>In 2015, China launched its Made in China 2025 10-year plan to up­date its man­u­fac­tur­ing base by rapidly de­vel­op­ing 10 high-tech in­dus­tries. These in­clude new en­ergy ve­hi­cles, next-gen­er­a­tion in­for­ma­tion tech­nol­ogy and telecom­mu­ni­ca­tions, ad­vanced robotics and ar­ti­fi­cial in­tel­li­gence.</p>
    <p>Its goal was to help China tran­si­tion from low-level, low-value man­u­fac­tur­ing to a high-tech, high-pro­duc­tiv­ity econ­omy and re­duce its de­pen­dence on for­eign tech­nol­ogy. Among the mea­sures taken were di­rect sub­si­dies to Chi­nese firms and in­vest­ments in and ac­qui­si­tions of for­eign high-tech firms.</p>
    <p>China’s poli­cies, to­gether with its tech­ni­cal tal­ent and en­trepreneur­ship, have led to the coun­try’s rapid rise in ar­eas such as ar­ti­fi­cial in­tel­li­gence and 5G tech­nol­ogy.</p>
    <p>Dr Kai-fu Lee, a tech ven­ture cap­i­tal­ist based in Bei­jing, said there is now a clear US-China du­op­oly in ar­ti­fi­cial in­tel­li­gence. “AI in China is ris­ing rapidly, boosted by sev­eral struc­tural ad­van­tages: huge data sets, a young army of tech­ni­cal tal­ent, ag­gres­sive en­trepreneur­s, and strong and prag­matic gov­ern­ment pol­icy,” he said in an in­ter­view with me­dia or­gan­i­sa­tion Project Syn­di­cate ear­lier this year.</p>
    <p>In an­other in­ter­view last year with The New Yorker, Dr Lee said the world had moved from the era of dis­cov­ery to the era of im­ple­men­ta­tion. So although the tech­nol­ogy may have been in­vented in the US, suc­cess­ful im­ple­men­ta­tion will de­pend on how many en­trepreneur­s and engi­neers the coun­try has, and how much data it pos­sesses.</p>
    <p>In the Project Syn­di­cate in­ter­view, he noted how the run­away suc­cess of TikTok could not be copied by top US firms as the video-shar­ing app had lev­er­aged China’s nat­u­ral ad­van­tage in hav­ing ac­cess to huge amounts of data. It then cre­ated sim­i­lar ex­pe­ri­ences for dif­fer­ent au­di­ences in other coun­tries, in­clud­ing the US.</p>
    <p>TikTok’s suc­cess is due to the ex­cel­lent ap­pli­ca­tion of ar­ti­fi­cial in­tel­li­gence, not through any break­throughs in ar­ti­fi­cial in­tel­li­gence tech­nolo­gies.</p>
    <p>And therein lies the rub – China has been adept at ap­ply­ing new tech­nolo­gies to cre­ate wildly suc­cess­ful prod­ucts and ser­vices, but has fallen short at in­vent­ing new tech­nol­ogy – a de­fi­ciency it wants to re­dress.</p>
    <p>SPEED BUMPS AHEAD</p>
    <p>In an­nounc­ing its plans for tech­no­log­i­cal self-re­liance, China has stressed that in­ter­na­tional col­lab­o­ra­tion on re­search will con­tinue, as it knows it needs to keep learn­ing from ad­vanced for­eign part­ners. But in the cli­mate of in­creased wari­ness, the ques­tion is whether it can con­tinue with this strat­egy of co­op­er­a­tion with for­eign re­search part­ners.</p>
    <p>Apart from for­eign col­lab­o­ra­tion, China is also well aware of the need to train more of its own tal­ent in science and tech­nol­ogy to boost it in­no­va­tive ca­pac­i­ties.</p>
    <p>In Jan­uary, the Ed­u­ca­tion Min­istry launched an ini­tia­tive called the Strong Base Plan to get China’s uni­ver­si­ties to en­rol more stu­dents in sub­jects such as math­e­mat­ics, physics, chem­istry and bi­ol­ogy. Grad­u­ates would be ex­pected to contribute in ar­eas such as high-tech chips, new ma­te­ri­als and ad­vanced pro­duc­tion.</p>
    <p>Although more poli­cies to boost R&D fur­ther are ex­pected to be an­nounced, the gov­ern­ment also needs to grap­ple with some of its cur­rent prob­lems.</p>
    <p>China cur­rently has schemes such as the Thou­sand Tal­ents Pro­gramme to en­cour­age top-tier Chi­nese sci­en­tists, schol­ars and en­trepreneur­s liv­ing over­seas to re­turn. It is also re­cruit­ing for­eign re­searchers to work in its R&D lab­o­ra­to­ries.</p>
    <p>How­ever, a study on the Chi­nese science, tech­nol­ogy, en­gi­neer­ing and math­e­mat­ics re­search en­vi­ron­ment pub­lished in 2018 showed sev­eral chal­lenges to the coun­try’s en­deav­our to be­come a global in­no­va­tor.</p>
    <p>One of the chal­lenges iden­ti­fied is an en­vi­ron­ment that does not pro­mote in­no­va­tive or orig­i­nal re­search be­cause quan­tity, such as num­ber of pa­pers pub­lished, is em­pha­sised over qual­ity of re­search.</p>
    <p>The study also found that aca­demic fraud, such as in the form of faked peer re­view and dis­cred­ited re­search, was a re­cur­ring prob­lem. This is in part be­cause of the pres­sure to pro­duce re­sults par­tic­u­larly in ar­eas marked as im­por­tant by the gov­ern­ment.</p>
    <p>In­deed, an­other prob­lem high­lighted by the study is the ex­ces­sive gov­ern­men­tal interventi­on in di­rect­ing sci­en­tific re­search lead­ing to a rigid sys­tem that lacks aca­demic free­dom.</p>
    <p>While China’s uni­ver­si­ties were granted greater au­ton­omy in the 1980s and 1990s, the cen­tral gov­ern­ment and the Chi­nese Com­mu­nist Party (CCP) have re­cently tight­ened con­trol, as Pres­i­dent Xi Jin­ping seeks to turn higher in­sti­tu­tions of learn­ing into “stronghold­s of the Party’s lead­er­ship”.</p>
    <p>It is a sim­i­lar sit­u­a­tion in the pri­vate sec­tor, where the rel­a­tively open en­vi­ron­ment from the 1990s to the early 2010s that spawned the likes of Alibaba and Ten­cent is be­ing cur­tailed as gov­ern­ment and party con­trol over pri­vate com­pa­nies grows.</p>
    <p>From 2018, pri­vate firms were re­quired to ex­pand the role of the CCP in their gov­er­nance. In Septem­ber, the CCP an­nounced guide­lines that would give party com­mit­tees in pri­vate com­pa­nies greater say in per­son­nel ap­point­ments and other im­por­tant de­ci­sions.</p>
    <p>An­other ques­tion hang­ing over in­dus­trial in­no­va­tion is whether in the cur­rent cli­mate the gov­ern­ment will con­tinue to al­low in­dus­tries to cre­ate and in­no­vate by wield­ing a light reg­u­la­tory hand, tight­en­ing the rules only when things threat­ened to spi­ral out of con­trol, as it has done in the past.</p>
    <p>Last month, fin­tech com­pany Ant Group’s stock mar­ket list­ing was scut­tled and new reg­u­la­tions were an­nounced that would rein in the fin­tech in­dus­try. Ear­lier, Ant Group’s co-founder Jack Ma had pub­licly crit­i­cised China’s bank reg­u­la­tors, sug­gest­ing that their em­pha­sis on pre­vent­ing sys­temic fi­nan­cial risk sti­fled in­no­va­tion.</p>
    <p>Mr Liu in his ar­ti­cle em­pha­sised the need to “de­velop the sci­en­tific spirit, en­cour­age bold ex­plo­ration and rea­son­able doubt, strengthen ba­sic re­search and fo­cus on orig­i­nal in­no­va­tion”.</p>
    <p>It will be a dif­fi­cult bal­anc­ing act – assert­ing con­trol over academia and in­dus­try, yet al­low­ing enough room for in­no­va­tion to take place.</p>
    <p>But suc­cess in this, as well as main­tain­ing col­lab­o­ra­tion with for­eign part­ners, will be key to China re­al­is­ing its am­bi­tious goals of tech­no­log­i­cal self-re­liance and lead­ing the world in in­no­va­tion.</p>
