    <p>ESKILSTUNA • Not con­tent with the av­er­age neigh­bour­hood thrift store, a city in Swe­den has opened a whole shop­ping mall ded­i­cated to giv­ing pre-owned items new life.</p>
    <p>The mall, lo­cated an hour’s train ride west of Stock­holm in the city of Eskilstuna, con­sists of 13 stores and covers 5,000 sq m, em­ploy­ing be­tween 50 and 65 peo­ple.</p>
    <p>It has been named ReTuna, a play on Eskilstuna, which be­gan an ef­fort to rein­vent it­self as an eco­log­i­cal city in the 1990s.</p>
    <p>“We are tra­di­tion­ally an in­dus­trial town, we have had our dif­fi­cul­ties and we thought we have to find some things that can build con­fi­dence and where we can take re­spon­si­bil­ity,” city Mayor Jimmy</p>
    <p>Jans­son told Agence FrancePres­se, adding that city l ead­ers were now try­ing to de­velop it “into a mod­ern in­dus­trial town”.</p>
    <p>ReTuna, in­au­gu­rated in 2015, was named “the world’s first shop­ping mall des­ig­nated for re­paired, re­cy­cled and re­stored items” by the Guin­ness Book of World Records this year.</p>
    <p>Some way from the gi­ant shop­ping malls of ma­jor cities, the com­plex still at­tracts some 250,000 to 300,000 vis­i­tors a year, ac­cord­ing to Ms Anna Bergstrom, who was in charge of ReTuna un­til early this year.</p>
    <p>Spread across two floors, the bou­tiques sell used tech gad­gets, books, chil­dren’s toys and home goods, as well as a slew of other prod­ucts.</p>
    <p>“You can ba­si­cally do all kinds of shop­ping here that you do in reg­u­lar stores: fur­ni­ture, clothes, flow­ers, sports ar­ti­cles, build­ing ma­te­ri­als, al­most ev­ery­thing,” Ms Bergstrom said.</p>
    <p>The mall, where a slight hint of the sig­na­ture smell of sec­ond-hand cloth­ing reigns, also of­fers a oneyear course in the de­sign of re­cy­cled prod­ucts.</p>
    <p>Buy­ing sec­ond-hand has seen a surge in Swe­den, where “kop­skam” (buy­ing shame) and “fly­gskam” (flight shame) are weigh­ing on the con­science of Swedes.</p>
    <p>Swe­den is aim­ing to be an eco­log­i­cal leader by be­com­ing car­bon neu­tral by 2045. By then, Eskilstuna wants to cap­ture more car­bon diox­ide than it emits and be in­de­pen­dent of fos­sil fu­els.</p>
    <p>Equipped with a state-of-the-art waste-sort­ing cen­tre, the city al­ready re­cy­cles or trans­forms most of its waste into en­ergy.</p>
    <p>But the green im­age has some blem­ishes. Cars fill the city’s streets and carparks, in­clud­ing the ReTuna carpark.</p>
    <p>Although the buses in the city cen­tre al­ready run on bio­gas, “there is still a lot to be done to re­duce car­bon diox­ide emis­sions”, Mr Jans­son, the city’s so­cial demo­cratic mayor for the last 10 years, ad­mit­ted.</p>
    <p>Eskilstuna – home to Volvo’s con­struc­tion equip­ment di­vi­sion and stain­less steel gi­ant Ou­tokumpu of Fin­land – adopted a “Cli­mate Plan 2020” in 2012 to be­come green­house gas neu­tral by the end of the decade.</p>
    <p>In 2016, a list of “50 en­vi­ron­men­tal prom­ises”, rang­ing from the de­vel­op­ment of re­new­able en­er­gies to bi­cy­cle paths, was also adopted.</p>
    <p>Ear­lier this year, the op­po­si­tion Green Party noted that there are “a num­ber of goals that have not been met”. Cit­ing wor­ries over whether Eskilstuna would be able to reach the cli­mate goals, it called on the city’s lead­ers to step up their ef­forts.</p>
