    <p>PARIS • Europe has passed a new bleak mile­stone after re­port­ing more than 11 mil­lion coro­n­avirus cases, as Austria and Greece be­came the lat­est coun­tries on the con­ti­nent to im­pose vary­ing de­grees of shut­downs.</p>
    <p>Europe has now reg­is­tered 11,008,465 in­fec­tions and al­most 285,000 deaths, ac­cord­ing to an Agence France-Presse tally of of­fi­cial sources on Tues­day.</p>
    <p>Still reel­ing from a deadly shoot­ing spree in the streets of Vi­enna on Mon­day evening, Austria went into par­tial lock­down while Greece shut down ma­jor cities.</p>
    <p>They j oined Bel­gium, France, Ger­many and Ire­land in reim­pos­ing tough curbs on peo­ple’s lives in an echo of spring as the virus – which was first de­tected in China at the end of last year – shows no sign of abat­ing.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, the Nether­lands ex­tended a par­tial shut­down to mu­se­ums, cin­e­mas and zoos as the gov­ern­ment said the rate of new cases was not eas­ing quickly enough.</p>
    <p>The strin­gent new mea­sures that are also set to hit Eng­land to­day have caused ex­as­per­a­tion and anger as ex­perts say Europe risks be­ing hit with fur­ther waves of in­fec­tions next year if no ef­fec­tive vac­cine is found.</p>
    <p>Un­der­scor­ing the per­ni­cious ef­fect of re­stric­tions on economies, liveli­hoods and gen­eral well-be­ing, Spain – where tourism ac­counts for 13 per cent of em­ploy­ment – said the num­ber of for­eign vis­i­tors plunged by 75 per cent dur­ing the first nine months of the year.</p>
    <p>The avi­a­tion in­dus­try has also been hard hit. In the Nether­lands, KLM pilots agreed to a five-year pay cut to un­block a planned bailout of the strug­gling air­line.</p>
    <p>The Span­ish gov­ern­ment said it would of­fer a €475 mil­lion (S$756 mil­lion) life­line to Air Europa to help see the air­line through the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, coun­tries are seek­ing des­per­ately for ways to ease or avoid lock­downs.</p>
    <p>The Bri­tish gov­ern­ment is rolling out quick-re­sult coro­n­avirus tests for the en­tire pop­u­la­tion of its hard-hit, 500,000-strong city of Liver­pool</p>
    <p>in a pi­lot scheme that could be scaled up na­tion­wide.</p>
    <p>The city joins Slo­vakia, which has de­cided to test its en­tire pop­u­la­tion of 5.4 mil­lion peo­ple.</p>
    <p>The tests “can be a mas­sive and pos­si­bly de­ci­sive use to us in this coun­try in de­feat­ing the virus”, Bri­tish Prime Min­is­ter Boris John­son said.</p>
    <p>“So amid the un­cer­tain gloom of Novem­ber, I see light ahead, and I’m ab­so­lutely cer­tain that we will have bet­ter days be­fore us.”</p>
    <p>He warned, how­ever, of a “risk of mor­tal­ity on a griev­ous scale” if Par­lia­ment fails to ap­prove a fresh coro­n­avirus lock­down in Eng­land, as he faced down rebels in his own Con­ser­va­tive Party op­posed to the plan.</p>
    <p>He also sought to ease con­cerns over the fi­nan­cial sup­port for work­ers and busi­nesses af­fected by the new four-week lock­down, telling the House of Com­mons that Chan­cel­lor of the Ex­che­quer Rishi Su­nak will spell out a plan, in­clud­ing details on the fur­lough pro­gramme he has ex­tended to Dec 2.</p>
    <p>In Bel­gium, which has one of the high­est num­ber of deaths com­pared with its pop­u­la­tion, the au­thor­i­ties might have shut down the coun­try, but have de­cided to keep book­stores open for the sake of peo­ple’s men­tal well-be­ing.</p>
    <p>“In a pe­riod of an­guish and un­cer­tainty that brings us back to our own mor­tal­ity, the book prob­a­bly re­mains the best food for thought and re­flec­tion,” said Brus­sels book­seller Marc El Kha­dem, as cus­tomers thumbed through pages around him.</p>
    <p>Italy’s Prime Min­is­ter Giuseppe Conte has signed a de­cree to en­force a na­tion­wide night cur­few from 10pm to­day to stop the resur­gence of the coro­n­avirus.</p>
    <p>He has strug­gled to build a coali­tion back­ing more strin­gent mea­sures after spo­radic protests broke out over an ear­lier de­ci­sion to shut bars and restau­rants early.</p>
    <p>How­ever, the cur­few mixed with other re­stric­tions – such as the clo­sure of shop­ping cen­tres on week­ends, which will re­main in force un­til Dec 3 – ap­peared to have struck the right com­pro­mise for re­gional lead­ers.</p>
    <p>Poland also an­nounced fur­ther re­stric­tions yes­ter­day to halt the spread of the coro­n­avirus and said it would im­pose a full na­tional lock­down if cases con­tinue to surge.</p>
    <p>Prime Min­is­ter Ma­teusz Mo­raw­iecki said most shops in malls, the­atres, mu­se­ums, gal­leries and cin­e­mas would close.</p>
    <p>All stu­dents who are not al­ready learn­ing re­motely will start to do so, while ho­tels will re­main open only for busi­ness guests.</p>
    <p>“If this plan fails, then in a week or 10 days we will have a na­tional quar­an­tine, which will be very se­vere,” Mr Mo­raw­iecki told a news con­fer­ence.</p>
    <p>Lithua­nia’s gov­ern­ment yes­ter­day de­clared a three-week lock­down start­ing on Satur­day.</p>
    <p>It said peo­ple should avoid so­cial con­tact and non-es­sen­tial travel and en­cour­aged them to work from home.</p>
    <p>Public groups of more than five peo­ple will be banned and no more than 10 peo­ple will be al­lowed at wed­ding cer­e­monies or funer­als.</p>
    <p>Turkey also im­posed re­stric­tions, say­ing restau­rants, cin­e­mas and other busi­nesses would have to shut at 10pm.</p>
    <p>Over in France, a hos­pi­tals fed­er­a­tion said the pres­sure was such that the au­thor­i­ties were plan­ning to trans­fer Covid-19 pa­tients to Ger­many for treat­ment, as Bel­gium is al­ready do­ing.</p>
    <p>As for Ger­many, it should post­pone non-ur­gent op­er­a­tions to free up beds and staff, ad­vised Dr Uwe Janssens, pres­i­dent of the In­ter­dis­ci­pli­nary As­so­ci­a­tion for In­ten­sive Care and Emer­gency Medicine.</p>
