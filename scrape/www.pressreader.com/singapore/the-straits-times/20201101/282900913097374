    <p>VI­ENNA • No­vak Djokovic ad­mit­ted he was “blown off court” fol­low­ing his heav­i­est de­feat in a three­set match on Fri­day, when he was knocked out of the Vi­enna ATP tour­na­ment by lucky loser Lorenzo Sonego.</p>
    <p>The Ital­ian, ranked 42nd and who had ini­tially lost in qual­i­fy­ing last week­end, is the first lucky loser ever to beat ten­nis’ world No. 1.</p>
    <p>His 6-2, 6-1 quar­ter-fi­nal stun­ner was a score that 33-year-old Djokovic would want to for­get quickly. The only other time he had won just three games was at the 2005 Aus­tralian Open at the hands of Marat Safin in a best-of­five en­counter.</p>
    <p>“He just blew me off the court, that’s all,” Djokovic told atp­tour.com.</p>
    <p>“He was bet­ter in ev­ery seg­ment of the game. It was a pretty bad match from my side, but amaz­ing from his side.</p>
    <p>“He def­i­nitely de­served this re­sult,” added the Ser­bian star, who was play­ing his first event since his Roland Gar­ros fi­nal de­feat by Rafael Nadal three weeks ago.</p>
    <p>Fri­day’s loss also means he will have to wait a lit­tle longer be­fore he com­pletes the for­mal­ity of equalling Pete Sam­pras’ all-time record of end­ing the sea­son top of the rank­ings for a sixth time.</p>
    <p>Djokovic, who will not be de­fend­ing his Paris Masters crown this week, is al­ready look­ing for­ward to the sea­son-end­ing ATP Fi­nals from Nov 15 to 22.</p>
    <p>“I’ve done what I needed to do and why I came here. I move on com­pletely fine with to­day’s re­sult and look­ing to the next chap­ter,” he said. “I’m healthy and look­ing for­ward to a strong fin­ish in Lon­don.”</p>
    <p>Sonego fired 26 win­ners past Djokovic, who lost for only the third time this year, along with 39 wins. The 17-time Grand Slam cham­pion man­aged just seven win­ners against 25 un­forced er­rors.</p>
    <p>“For sure it’s the best vic­tory of my life. No­vak is the best in the world. To­day I played so, so good,” the 25-year-old Sonego said.</p>
    <p>“It’s un­be­liev­able. It’s amaz­ing. I played the best match in my life. I’m so happy for this.”</p>
    <p>Sec­ond seed and de­fend­ing cham­pion Do­minic Thiem also lost on Fri­day, go­ing down 7-6 (7-5), 6-2 to world No. 8 An­drey Rublev.</p>
    <p>The Rus­sian hit 30 win­ners past the US Open cham­pion.</p>
    <p>“I came here with the mood that I have noth­ing to lose,” said Rublev, who is chas­ing a fifth ti­tle of the year.</p>
    <p>“I had al­ready a re­ally great sea­son. I came here with zero ex­pec­ta­tions, just want­ing to do my best. To try to fight ev­ery match. At the end, I am here in the semi-fi­nals.”</p>
