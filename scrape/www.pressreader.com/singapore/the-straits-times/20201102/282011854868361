    <p>We re­fer to Straits Times tech edi­tor Irene Tham’s re­port (TraceTo­gether to­ken col­lec­tion raises ques­tions, Oct 30).</p>
    <p>We wish to clar­ify that while TraceTo­gether-only SafeEn­try (TT-only SE) will be pi­loted at cin­e­mas from Nov 16, those who have not yet down­loaded the app or col­lected a to­ken will still be able to check in with their iden­tity card.</p>
    <p>TT-only SE will be im­ple­mented pro­gres­sively to al­low the public time to get used to the new</p>
    <p>SafeEn­try check-in method.</p>
    <p>TT to­kens pri­mar­ily cater to the el­derly and the dig­i­tally ex­cluded. For fi­nan­cial pru­dence, we have to match sup­ply to ex­pected de­mand.</p>
    <p>Since distri­bu­tion be­gan, the de­mand for to­kens has been higher than ex­pected and we are there­fore ramp­ing up pro­duc­tion.</p>
    <p>We have also made three key changes to our distri­bu­tion plan. • Only res­i­dents of the</p>
    <p>con­stituency are al­lowed to col­lect at their com­mu­nity cen­tre.</p>
    <p>• Col­lec­tion points will be opened pro­gres­sively, in one con­stituency at a time.</p>
    <p>• Once a col­lec­tion point is open, res­i­dents will have enough time to col­lect their to­ken. Suf­fi­cient stock will be made avail­able at each com­mu­nity cen­tre.</p>
    <p>Th­ese mea­sures are to pre­vent over­crowd­ing.</p>
    <p>It also en­sures that ev­ery res­i­dent will be able to col­lect a to­ken from a col­lec­tion point near them.</p>
    <p>We thank mem­bers of the public for their sup­port of our na­tional con­tact trac­ing ef­forts.</p>
    <p>The TraceTo­gether app has been down­loaded more than 2.5 mil­lion times since be­ing made avail­able on March 20. We have dis­trib­uted more than 400, 000 TraceTo­gether to­kens since</p>
    <p>Sept 14.</p>
    <p>The ef­fec­tive­ness of con­tact trac­ing is in­creased by the over­all par­tic­i­pa­tion rate.</p>
    <p>We have one of the high­est par­tic­i­pa­tion rates in the world and this puts us in good stead for the next phase.</p>
    <p>As we re­open our econ­omy, dig­i­tal tools such as SafeEn­try and TraceTo­gether are crit­i­cal to en­able us to quickly con­tain the spread of the virus in the com­mu­nity; and in so do­ing, pro­tect all of us.</p>
