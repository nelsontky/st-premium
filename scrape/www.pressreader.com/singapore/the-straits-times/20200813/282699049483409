    <p>In a re­cent video that has gone vi­ral on Chi­nese so­cial me­dia, Hong Kong singer Kenny Bee is seen cry­ing while re­luc­tantly giv­ing away his el­dest daugh­ter at her wed­ding, shield­ing his face at times to hide his tears.</p>
    <p>The 67-year-old singer is also shown star­ing down his son-in-law, as if to warn him to treat his daugh­ter right.</p>
    <p>The video, which has been picked up by many Chi­nese me­dia out­lets, has evoked ad­mi­ra­tion from ne­ti­zens, many of whom praised him for be­ing a de­voted fa­ther. Oth­ers gen­tly poked fun at the singer’s pro­tec­tive­ness over his chil­dren.</p>
    <p>How­ever, af­ter ver­i­fi­ca­tion from the Hong Kong me­dia, the video turned out to be a clip from a 2013 mu­sic video by Tai­wanese singer Tiger Huang.</p>
    <p>Bee’s “daugh­ter and son-in-law” in the video are ac­tors.</p>
    <p>That does not mean that giv­ing his daugh­ters away in real life will be easy for Bee, who has said in pre­vi­ous in­ter­views that he is re­luc­tant to think of his daugh­ters get­ting mar­ried.</p>
    <p>He has a son and daugh­ter from his first mar­riage to so­cialite­turned-ac­tress Teresa Che­ung and two daugh­ters with his sec­ond wife, Fan Jiang.</p>
