    <p>NEW YORK • Mil­lions of Amer­i­cans ap­peared to be shrug­ging off pub­lic health warn­ings and trav­el­ling ahead of the Thanks­giv­ing hol­i­day, likely fu­elling an alarm­ing surge in Covid-19 in­fec­tions.</p>
    <p>Even as the US hits a record 168,000 new cases per day on av­er­age, peo­ple were flock­ing to air­ports against of­fi­cials’ ad­vice. The long hol­i­day week­end, which be­gins tomorrow, is tra­di­tion­ally the busiest travel pe­riod of the year.</p>
    <p>About one mil­lion pas­sen­gers passed through air­port se­cu­rity on Sun­day, the most since March. It was the sec­ond time in three days that US air travel screen­ings sur­passed one mil­lion, said the Trans­porta­tion Se­cu­rity Ad­min­is­tra­tion. The Amer­i­can Au­to­mo­bile As­so­ci­a­tion fore­cast that 45 mil­lion to 50 mil­lion peo­ple will take to the high­ways over the hol­i­day.</p>
    <p>Soar­ing rates of coro­n­avirus cases, deaths and hos­pi­tal­i­sa­tions in the coun­try have con­tin­ued un­abated. The seven-day rolling av­er­age num­ber of Covid-19 deaths climbed for a 12th straight day, reach­ing 1,500 on Mon­day, while coro­n­avirus hos­pi­tal­i­sa­tions na­tion­ally have surged nearly 50 per cent over the past two weeks.</p>
    <p>State and lo­cal gov­ern­ment of­fi­cials have reim­posed a host of re­stric­tions in re­cent weeks.</p>
    <p>Plead­ing with New York­ers to</p>
    <p>stay home and avoid gath­er­ings dur­ing the hol­i­day, Gov­er­nor An­drew Cuomo re­minded them of the grim early days of the out­break when as many as 800 peo­ple died in a sin­gle day across the state.</p>
    <p>Still, the im­per­a­tives of fam­ily and fa­tigue over curbs have left many Amer­i­cans de­fy­ing health ad­vice that could save their lives.</p>
    <p>“We are not go­ing to let Covid scare us,” said con­struc­tion worker Brian McDonough, 47, a dili­gent mask wearer who is spend­ing Thanks­giv­ing with his sis­ter near his home in Worth, Illi­nois.</p>
    <p>“We get tested, we are neg­a­tive, so life goes on... Thanks­giv­ing is Thanks­giv­ing. Christ­mas is Christ­mas. New Year’s is New Year’s. If peo­ple die it’s go­ing to hap­pen, and there’s noth­ing we can do about it un­til we get a vac­cine,” he said.</p>
    <p>Ms Edie Tay­lor, 29, a build­ing de­sign spe­cial­ist in Oak­land, Cal­i­for­nia, was less san­guine as she pre­pared to board a flight to her home­town of Birm­ing­ham, Alabama, to at­tend a fam­ily gath­er­ing and then stay on through New Year’s.</p>
    <p>“It’s ter­ri­fy­ing,” said Ms Tay­lor, who said she would have changed her plans, but that af­ter giv­ing up her apart­ment in Oak­land, “I didn’t have any­where to live”.</p>
    <p>Ms Don­nalie Hope, 78, of Peters­burg, West Vir­ginia, will be spend­ing the day with her vis­it­ing daugh­ter and a neigh­bour. She said they would try to so­cial dis­tance.</p>
