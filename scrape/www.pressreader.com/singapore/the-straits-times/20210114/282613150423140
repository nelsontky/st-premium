        <p>Nine trip­ty­chs and 15 sets of painted ob­jects by Yip Yew Chong are on sale, with prices start­ing at un­der $1,000</p>
        <p>Fans of painter Yip Yew Chong can now take home a piece of his most pop­u­lar mu­rals from his first solo show.</p>
        <p>Nine trip­ty­chs and 15 sets of painted ob­jects by the artist are on sale, with prices start­ing at un­der $1,000 for small ob­jects, such as a chop­ping board painted with an ap­ple, to up to $6,400 for paint­ings.</p>
        <p>Some­thing, Some­where, Somewhen opened at Art Porters Gallery on Tues­day. Fans will recog­nise the date as the artist’s birth­day, a lit­tle Easter egg ref­er­ence which ap­pears in his mu­rals.</p>
        <p>The af­fa­ble 52-year-old, who was a fi­nance di­rec­tor be­fore quit­ting in 2018 to paint mu­rals, says with a laugh: “Nor­mally, I don’t cel­e­brate birth­days.”</p>
        <p>The tra­di­tion of paint­ing his birth date into works be­gan al­most by ac­ci­dent with his first mu­ral of a bar­ber scene in Ever­ton Road. “I had a cal­en­dar and I was won­der­ing what date I should put. A sin­gle num­ber didn’t look nice.”</p>
        <p>He de­cided to put his birth date and, voila, a tra­di­tion was born.</p>
        <p>Tra­di­tion is some­thing he is of­ten as­so­ci­ated with. He has painted more than 50 mu­rals of scenes from yes­ter­year around Sin­ga­pore. Many of the most pop­u­lar and elab­o­rate can be found in Chi­na­town, his child­hood home.</p>
        <p>The trip­ty­chs for his solo show ex­tract de­tails from some of his early mu­rals, such as a wa­ter tank in My Chi­na­town Home and pa­per masks from Pa­per Mask And Pup­pet Seller.</p>
        <p>“These are early works peo­ple can eas­ily con­nect with,” adds the artist, who is mar­ried with two chil­dren.</p>
        <p>While can­vases may seem eas­ier to work on, since they are smaller and can be painted in­doors, Yip found them more chal­leng­ing. “It’s tougher be­cause it re­quires you to paint in finer de­tails. For mu­rals, you can use big brush strokes. They don’t need to be per­fect be­cause, most of the time, peo­ple step back to see the whole mu­ral.”</p>
        <p>When the pan­demic erupted last year and the cir­cuit breaker was im­posed, he turned to paint­ing on can­vases, some­thing he had al­ways wanted to pur­sue.</p>
        <p>His friend­ship with Art Porters owner Guil­laume Levy-Lambert, which started when he was paint­ing mu­rals nearby in the Blair Plain con­ser­va­tion neigh­bour­hood, led to the gallery host­ing the show.</p>
        <p>Mr Levy-Lambert, 57, says he was wor­ried about the business im­pact of Covid-19, and when think­ing about what to show this year, Yip’s works fit the bill.</p>
        <p>“We knew that Sin­ga­pore Art</p>
        <p>Week wouldn’t have for­eign col­lec­tors vis­it­ing, so we started think­ing about what we can do for Sin­ga­pore­ans, some­thing for the gen­eral public, not just tra­di­tional col­lec­tors.”</p>
        <p>Hence the ac­ces­si­ble price points for the works, some of which can also be cus­tomised by buy­ers. A cou­ple of chairs are painted with trompe l’oeil images of a mo­bile phone and an air­mail let­ter, and Yip will cus­tomise the text on these items for buy­ers.</p>
        <p>The show marks his mi­gra­tion to a dif­fer­ent medium. He says he will be more se­lec­tive about paint­ing mu­rals from now on.</p>
        <p>Hav­ing painted them since 2015, he says half-jok­ingly: “Peo­ple will get tired of my mu­rals.”</p>
        <p>Last year, he worked on more than 30 can­vases and has al­ready fin­ished enough for another ex­hi­bi­tion. Sto­ries From Yes­ter­year, which will open on Feb 18 at an undis­closed venue, will fea­ture larger panoramic paint­ings filled with scenes of peo­ple, in­clud­ing a Per­anakan wed­ding and vi­gnettes of kam­pung life.</p>
        <p>“Mu­rals are meant to be tran­sient,” he says. “That’s another rea­son I am mov­ing to can­vases. Can­vases have the op­por­tu­nity to be col­lected, taken care of and passed down through gen­er­a­tions.”</p>
