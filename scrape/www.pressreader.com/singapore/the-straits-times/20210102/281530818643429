    <p>With leisure travel grind­ing to a halt amid the pan­demic, many in Sin­ga­pore did not make full use of their an­nual leave. While these unused va­ca­tion days may have been wiped off in other years, some or­gan­i­sa­tions have al­lowed em­ploy­ees to carry over their leave days to this year. Oth­ers have come up with other means to en­sure that their em­ploy­ees’ paid leave days do not go to waste.</p>
    <p>With leisure travel grind­ing to a halt amid the coro­n­avirus pan­demic last year, many em­ploy­ees in Sin­ga­pore found them­selves in the strange po­si­tion – per­haps for the first time – of not hav­ing made full use of their an­nual leave.</p>
    <p>While these unused va­ca­tion days may have been wiped off in other years, some or­gan­i­sa­tions have al­lowed em­ploy­ees to carry over their leave days to the next year.</p>
    <p>Oth­ers have come up with other means to en­sure that their em­ploy­ees’ paid leave days do not go to waste.</p>
    <p>Em­ploy­ees at Nanyang Tech­no­log­i­cal Univer­sity do­nated a col­lec­tive 20,145 days of an­nual leave to­wards stu­dent aid and en­dow­ments.</p>
    <p>The do­nated leave days, cour­tesy of more than 1,800 em­ploy­ees, are worth about $10.25 mil­lion. Each em­ployee do­nated an av­er­age of 11 leave days.</p>
    <p>OCBC Bank ad­justed its leave pol­icy last year, al­low­ing em­ploy­ees to carry for­ward ad­di­tional leave days to this year.</p>
    <p>The bank’s staff are usu­ally able to carry for­ward seven days, but have been per­mit­ted to do so for 12 days last year, or en­cash up to five days of their an­nual leave.</p>
    <p>In June last year, the Sin­ga­pore work­ers of tech gi­ant Mi­cron raised a to­tal of $1.88 mil­lion through the firm’s em­ployee do­na­tion match­ing pro­gramme.</p>
    <p>This in­cluded both cash do­na­tions and the ex­change of paid an­nual leave for mone­tary do­na­tions. The raised funds were dis­trib­uted to five char­i­ties, in­clud­ing The Food Bank Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, civil ser­vants were given a longer pe­riod to clear their unused leave and the op­tion to en­cash part of it this year.</p>
    <p>The un­prece­dented move al­lows some 85,000 civil ser­vants to carry for­ward half of their an­nual leave from 2019 into this year, if the leave was not used by the end of last year.</p>
    <p>Nor­mally, civil ser­vants’ unused leave from a pre­vi­ous year would be for­feited, mean­ing that 2019’s leave days could have been car­ried for­ward only into last year, but not this year.</p>
    <p>Their re­main­ing leave – af­ter car­ry­ing for­ward half of 2019’s va­ca­tion days to this year – can be cashed in.</p>
    <p>Public health­care work­ers have been al­lowed to en­cash or carry for­ward unused leave from 2019 into this year.</p>
    <p>Up to a third of their unused paid leave days from last year can be con­verted to cash or brought for­ward to this year as well.</p>
