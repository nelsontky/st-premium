    <p>•</p>
    <p>France coach Di­dier Deschamps said he saw “some in­ter­est­ing things” from Mar­cus Thu­ram de­spite Fin­land stun­ning the world cham­pi­ons 2-0, on the day the Borus­sia Monchengla­d­bach at­tacker em­u­lated his fa­ther Lil­ian by mak­ing his de­but for Les Bleus.</p>
    <p>Thu­ram was picked by Deschamps for the friendly on Wed­nes­day at the Stade de France over 22 years af­ter his dad won the World Cup at the same ground, but de­spite a strong per­for­mance on the left wing he could not stop the Finns from com­ing out on top.</p>
    <p>“He has done some good things, es­pe­cially dur­ing the first half. He could have scored with a bit more luck when his header hit the cross­bar,” said Deschamps.</p>
    <p>“He has tried, he has cre­ated some space. It was a bit more dif­fi­cult for him dur­ing the sec­ond half. There were less gaps and maybe he was a bit tired too.</p>
    <p>“But he has shown us some in­ter­est­ing things for his first cap.”</p>
    <p>The 23-year-old hit the bar with less than 15 min­utes gone and soon af­ter flashed a dif­fi­cult vol­ley over as he and Lu­cas Digne caused con­tin­ual prob­lems down the left flank for the away side.</p>
    <p>How­ever, Mar­cus Forss stunned the hosts when he col­lected the ball af­ter a Moussa Sis­soko mis­take and rammed home at Steve Man­danda’s near post.</p>
    <p>France barely had any time to re­act be­fore Onni Valakari dou­bled the away side’s lead with a stun­ning ef­fort af­ter be­ing left to stroll to­wards goal.</p>
    <p>Deschamps brought on An­toine Griez­mann, An­thony Mar­tial and N’Golo Kante just be­fore the hour mark but could not break down the well-or­gan­ised Finns.</p>
    <p>The re­sult will dis­ap­point the France coach but he will be buoyed by the per­for­mance of Thu­ram, who made more of an im­pres­sion than some of the more es­tab­lished in­ter­na­tional play­ers on dis­play, in­clud­ing Paul Pogba and Olivier Giroud.</p>
    <p>“It was a good first half de­spite the goals,” Thu­ram told TV chan­nel M6. “I’m try­ing to learn a lot along­side the other in­ter­na­tion­als... and to gain as much ex­pe­ri­ence as pos­si­ble. I hope that will con­tinue.”</p>
    <p>He could be in con­tention for France’s up­com­ing Na­tions League matches against Euro­pean cham­pi­ons Por­tu­gal to­mor­row and Swe</p>
    <p>den next Tues­day.</p>
    <p>Deschamps also said last week that the son of his old France team­mate had “gone up a level” since join­ing Monchengla­d­bach from French side Guingamp in July last year.</p>
    <p>Thu­ram has scored three times in 11 ap­pear­ances for the Bun­desliga side this sea­son and was the first foot­baller in Ger­many to</p>
    <p>take a knee in protest fol­low­ing the death of the 46-year-old African Amer­i­can Ge­orge Floyd in po­lice cus­tody in Min­neapo­lis.</p>
    <p>Lil­ian is the most-capped player in the his­tory of the French na­tional team with 142 ap­pear­ances. The former de­fender, 48, also tri­umphed along­side Deschamps at Euro 2000.</p>
