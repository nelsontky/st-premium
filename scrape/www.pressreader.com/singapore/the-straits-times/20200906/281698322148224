    <p>MEL­BOURNE • Pro­test­ers against a Covid-19 lockdown de­fied po­lice in Australia yes­ter­day, prompt­ing 15 ar­rests, even as the state of Vic­to­ria con­tin­ued its grad­ual im­prove­ment in stem­ming new cases due to the nearly five weeks of re­stric­tions.</p>
    <p>Around 200 pro­test­ers in Mel­bourne, cap­i­tal of Vic­to­ria state, ral­lied with chants of “free­dom” and “hu­man rights mat­ter”, as swarms of po­lice sur­rounded them.</p>
    <p>One of the ar­rests was for as­sault­ing po­lice, while oth­ers were ar­rested or fined for breach­ing health re­stric­tions, Vic­to­ria po­lice said in a state­ment.</p>
    <p>“It is not safe, it is not smart, it is not law­ful. In fact, it is ab­so­lutely self­ish for peo­ple to be out there protest­ing,” state Premier Daniel</p>
    <p>An­drews told a news con­fer­ence.</p>
    <p>Vic­to­ria re­ported 76 new Covid-19 in­fec­tions and 11 deaths yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Mr An­drews is due to out­line plans today for eas­ing Mel­bourne’s stage four re­stric­tions, which shut large parts of the econ­omy, re­quired ev­ery­one to stay home ex­cept for es­sen­tial busi­ness, and im­posed a night-time cur­few.</p>
    <p>There were two ral­lies in Syd­ney and one in By­ron Bay in the state of New South Wales, which also breached lo­cal re­stric­tions against large gath­er­ings.</p>
    <p>Out­side Vic­to­ria, Australia re­ported five new coro­n­avirus in­fec­tions in New South Wales, one in Queens­land and one in South Australia.</p>
    <p>Over the past two months, in­fec­tions in the coun­try have more than tripled to 26,207, with Vic­to­ria mak­ing up around 75 per cent of the to­tal.</p>
    <p>Australia’s deaths from Covid-19 have surged over that pe­riod to 748 from 104, with Vic­to­ria mak­ing up 90 per cent.</p>
    <p>“These stark fig­ures show us the se­ri­ous im­pact of the sec­ond wave of Covid-19 in Vic­to­ria,” Australia’s deputy chief med­i­cal of­fi­cer Michael Kidd told re­porters.</p>
    <p>Vic­to­ria’s new cases were below 100 most days last week, down from a peak of 725 new in­fec­tions on Aug 5, but re­main higher than what health of­fi­cials had hoped five weeks into a six-week hard lockdown.</p>
    <p>“The tail of the sec­ond wave is a stub­born thing,” Mr An­drews said.</p>
    <p>Australia’s govern­ment and busi­nesses have urged Vic­to­ria, which makes up about a quar­ter of the na­tion’s econ­omy, to lift the re­stric­tions as the coun­try has sunk into its first re­ces­sion since 1991.</p>
    <p>Mr An­drews said he would take a “steady and safe” ap­proach out of the lockdown.</p>
    <p>“This is a health prob­lem in the first in­stance and un­til you fix the health prob­lem, there can be no eco­nomic re­pair,” he said.</p>
    <p>In neigh­bour­ing New Zealand, a</p>
    <p>for­mer prime min­is­ter of the Cook Is­lands, Mr Joseph Wil­liams, died of Covid-19.</p>
    <p>His was the sec­ond coro­n­avirus­re­lated death in the coun­try in two days, fol­low­ing an out­break in the coun­try’s largest city, Auck­land, tak­ing the coun­try’s to­tal to 24 deaths.</p>
