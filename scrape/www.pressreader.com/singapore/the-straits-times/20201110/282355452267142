    <p>Busi­ness col­lec­tive Sin­ga­pore Ten­ants United for Fair­ness (SGTUFF) will be hold­ing a job fair with more than 1,000 po­si­tions on of­fer in a bid to help ease the labour short­age in front-line in­dus­tries.</p>
    <p>Of the more than 1,000 job va­can­cies, at least 600 are from SGTUFF mem­bers.</p>
    <p>Among the em­ploy­ers par­tic­i­pat­ing in the job fair are Union Power, Les Amis Group, Spa Esprit Group, Soup Spoon, Sakae Sushi, Qiren Or­gan­i­sa­tion and Hao Mart. More than 50 per cent of the va­can­cies are pro­fes­sional, man­ager, ex­ec­u­tive and tech­ni­cian roles.</p>
    <p>The job fair will be held at Keat Hong Com­mu­nity Club on Thurs­day and Fri­day. En­try is free and open to all Sin­ga­pore­ans and per­ma­nent res­i­dents.</p>
    <p>The col­lec­tive was started in Fe­bru­ary when dis­grun­tled ten­ants in re­tail, F&B and ser­vices banded to­gether to ad­dress what they saw as un­fair be­hav­iour from their land­lords amid the Covid-19 out­break. Now, there are more than 700 busi­ness own­ers in the group, rep­re­sent­ing nearly 830 brands in about 3,100 re­tail out­lets. They hire about 24,970 peo­ple col­lec­tively.</p>
    <p>“Sin­ga­pore is in the midst of its big­gest re­ces­sion since in­de­pen­dence and re­trench­ments are at an all-time high,” said SGTUFF chair­man Ter­ence Yow. Yet, he noted that many of the busi­ness own­ers in the col­lec­tive con­tinue to face a short­age of em­ploy­ees.</p>
    <p>“We see job match­ing as one of SGTUFF’s long-term pri­or­i­ties and we are work­ing with var­i­ous grass­roots or­gan­i­sa­tions and gov­ern­ment agen­cies to con­vince more Sin­ga­pore­ans to em­bark on ex­cit­ing new ca­reers in the front­line busi­ness in­dus­try,” Mr Yow added.</p>
