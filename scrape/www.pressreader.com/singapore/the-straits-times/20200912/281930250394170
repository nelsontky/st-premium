    <p>• Mr Yoshi­hide Suga, Ja­pan’s gov­ern­ment spokesman and the front run­ner to be­come the next prime min­is­ter, said yes­ter­day he saw no need to raise the sales tax for a decade, al­though an in­crease was pos­si­ble af­ter that.</p>
    <p>Mr Suga, in a tele­vi­sion pro­gramme on Thurs­day, had said a fu­ture sales tax hike may be needed to help pay for the grow­ing costs of an age­ing pop­u­la­tion.</p>
    <p>The com­ments on the po­lit­i­cally sen­si­tive topic were con­sid­ered re­mark­ably can­did, par­tic­u­larly for a politi­cian in the run­ning to re­place Prime Min­is­ter Shinzo Abe, who is step­ping down for health rea­sons.</p>
    <p>“My com­ments about the sales tax were about the fu­ture,” Mr Suga told re­porters. “Prime Min­is­ter Abe has said an in­crease will not be needed for 10 years... I agree,” he said. “With­out en­sur­ing eco­nomic re­vi­tal­i­sa­tion, restor­ing fis­cal health will not hap­pen.”</p>
    <p>Ja­pan’s sales tax was raised to 10 per cent from 8 per cent last year af­ter mul­ti­ple de­lays and de­bate about the eco­nomic and fis­cal im­pacts of do­ing so.</p>
    <p>Mr Suga’s com­ments on a pos­si­ble fu­ture in­crease ap­peared to win the back­ing of Fi­nance Min­is­ter Taro Aso. “There’s no doubt a sales tax hike would be one op­tion as part of ef­forts to re­form spend­ing and rev­enue,” Mr Aso told re­porters yes­ter­day when asked about Mr Suga’s re­marks.</p>
    <p>The rul­ing Lib­eral Demo­cratic Party (LDP) will hold a lead­er­ship elec­tion on Mon­day to re­place Mr Abe. Mr Suga is widely ex­pected to win the race to be­come party chief, vir­tu­ally as­sur­ing him of be­com­ing premier be­cause of the LDP’s ma­jor­ity in Par­lia­ment.</p>
    <p>A ma­jor­ity of Ja­panese firms want Mr Suga to be­come the next prime min­is­ter as many see no need to change the sta­tus quo on stim­u­lus pol­icy, at least un­til the coronaviru­s cri­sis ends, a Reuters poll found.</p>
