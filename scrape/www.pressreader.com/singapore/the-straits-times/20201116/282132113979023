    <p>Di­a­betic pa­tients will soon have ac­cess to per­son­alised health coach­ing, sports fa­cil­i­ties and pro­grammes that help them lead health­ier lives.</p>
    <p>Sport Sin­ga­pore and Di­a­betes Sin­ga­pore yes­ter­day signed a deal that lets pa­tients get ad­vice from health coaches and use Ac­tiveSG’s fa­cil­i­ties. An­nounc­ing this at the World Di­a­betes Day 2020 event at Sin­ga­pore Gen­eral Hospi­tal’s Academia Au­di­to­rium, Sec­ond Min­is­ter for Health Masa­gos Zulk­i­fli said: “We must not lose sight of our war against di­a­betes. It con­tin­ues to be a ma­jor pub­lic health con­cern even amidst the pandemic.”</p>
    <p>Mr Masa­gos, who is also Min­is­ter for So­cial and Fam­ily De­vel­op­ment, said one in three Sin­ga­pore­ans is at risk of de­vel­op­ing di­a­betes in his life­time, and “obe­sity and seden­tary life­styles place us at an even greater risk of de­vel­op­ing Type 2 di­a­betes”.</p>
    <p>He en­cour­aged in­di­vid­u­als to adopt healthy habits even as the Gov­ern­ment lever­ages tech­nol­ogy to com­bat the dis­ease.</p>
    <p>Such tech­nol­ogy in­cludes the Health Pro­mo­tion Board’s free Lu­miHealth app rolled out last month with Ap­ple that en­cour­ages users through per­son­alised re­minders, pro­grammes, ac­tiv­ity coach­ing and in­cen­tives to adopt healthy habits.</p>
    <p>Those with di­a­betes should con­tinue to have reg­u­lar fol­low-up with their health­care prac­ti­tion­ers and un­dergo screen­ing to re­duce the risk of de­vel­op­ing com­pli­ca­tions, said Mr Masa­gos. They can also ac­cess a wealth of in­for­ma­tion on di­a­betes man­age­ment on the HealthHub web­site’s Di­a­betes Hub.</p>
    <p>Mr Masa­gos also urged mem­bers of the pub­lic to un­dergo screen­ing. Those above 40 should have reg­u­lar screen­ing for chronic dis­eases ev­ery three years; those be­tween 18 and 39 can use HealthHub’s Di­a­betes Risk As­sess­ment on­line test.</p>
    <p>Since the test was launched in Septem­ber 2017, about 18 per cent of users have been found to be at higher risk, and about one in 10 who had health screen­ing was di­ag­nosed with pre-di­a­betes or di­a­betes.</p>
    <p>In line with the theme for World Di­a­betes Day, “The Nurse and Di­a­betes”, Mr Masa­gos ad­dressed how health­care work­ers are bet­ter equipped to han­dle di­a­betes cases.</p>
    <p>Through an on­line por­tal in­tro­duced ear­lier this year, these work­ers can pro­vide pa­tients and care­givers with cus­tomised in­for­ma­tion on di­a­betes preven­tion and con­trol.</p>
    <p>They also have ac­cess to train­ing that helps them em­power and mo­ti­vate di­a­betic pa­tients to bet­ter man­age their con­di­tion them­selves.</p>
    <p>Un­til the end of this month, di­a­betic mem­bers of Di­a­betes Sin­ga­pore can get free flu vac­ci­na­tions.</p>
    <p>“The war on di­a­betes is not over. It re­quires our en­tire na­tion to work to­gether to tri­umph, just as we did to stem the spread of Covid-19. All of us have a role to play in look­ing after our health and that of our loved ones,” said Mr Masa­gos.</p>
