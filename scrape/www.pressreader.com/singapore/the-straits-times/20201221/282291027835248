    <p>Un­re­lent­ing cross-ex­am­i­na­tion made the vis­i­ble dif­fer­ence in a civil law­suit in­volv­ing a woman seek­ing $5 mil­lion from na­tional wa­ter agency PUB over a man­hole fall.</p>
    <p>Madam Chan Hui Peng, 47, had sued PUB for neg­li­gence af­ter fall­ing into a man­hole in Ko­van Road in 2015.</p>
    <p>She frac­tured her an­kle and claimed to have suf­fered post-trau</p>
    <p>matic stress dis­or­der as a re­sult.</p>
    <p>Af­ter be­ing grilled on the stand over four days of a sched­uled 11-day trial, she agreed to a set­tle­ment, the terms of which are con­fi­den­tial.</p>
    <p>Her lawyer Ivan Lee said the strain of the hear­ing had taken a toll on her men­tal health and emo­tional well-be­ing.</p>

    <p>K. An­parasan, who led the cros­sex­am­i­na­tion for PUB’s in­surer with lawyer Grace Tan, said the de­fence took a tag-team ap­proach, tak­ing turns to chal­lenge Madam Chan’s con­sis­tency in her ev­i­dence, based on the thou­sands of pages of doc­u­ments she had sub­mit­ted to sup­port her claims.</p>
    <p>“Our team had to come up with a cross-ex­am­i­na­tion plan as we wanted to lay out de­tails in pre­sent­ing our case to the court to un­der­mine her al­le­ga­tions or to con­firm points in our case. In plan­ning this, ev­ery ques­tion we asked in cros­sex­am­i­na­tion either made a point or it set up the next ques­tion that will prove our case,” he said.</p>
