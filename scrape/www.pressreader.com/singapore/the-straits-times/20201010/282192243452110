    <p>•</p>
    <p>Even as mil­lions of peo­ple in the United States have lost their jobs dur­ing the coro­n­avirus pan­demic, the soar­ing stock mar­ket since spring has de­liv­ered out­size gains to the wealth­i­est Amer­i­cans. And few among the su­per-rich have done as well as cor­po­rate ex­ec­u­tives who re­ceived stock awards this year.</p>
    <p>Dick’s Sport­ing Goods chief ex­ec­u­tive Ed­ward Stack and Pelo­ton pres­i­dent Wil­liam Lynch, for ex­am­ple, are each sit­ting on pa­per gains of more than US$60 mil­lion (S$81.5 mil­lion) on stock-based awards they mostly re­ceived in the first three months of the year, based on Wed­nes­day’s clos­ing stock prices, ac­cord­ing to an analysis by In­sti­tu­tional Share­holder Ser­vices (ISS), which ad­vises in­vestors on how to vote on cor­po­rate mat­ters.</p>
    <p>And Mr Stephane Ban­cel, chief ex­ec­u­tive of Moderna, a drug­maker de­vel­op­ing a coro­n­avirus vac­cine, re­ceived op­tions in Fe­bru­ary that have ap­pre­ci­ated by nearly US$30 mil­lion.</p>
    <p>The pay gains are a re­sult of the sharp rise in the stock prices of these com­pa­nies, which in­vestors are bet­ting are well-po­si­tioned to grow dur­ing the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>An­other rea­son these stock awards have ap­pre­ci­ated so much is that some of the grants were made when the stock mar­ket was close to its low­est point for the year.</p>
    <p>These gains are also a re­minder that in­come and wealth in the US econ­omy are tilted heav­ily to­wards a tiny num­ber of top earn­ers who own sig­nif­i­cant amounts of stock. Most Amer­i­cans own lit­tle or no stock, ac­cord­ing to a re­cent Fed­eral Re­serve report, and many had less in sav­ings in 2019 than they did be­fore the last re­ces­sion a decade ago.</p>
    <p>“The stock mar­ket is not an indi­ca­tor of the health of the econ­omy for work­ing peo­ple; it’s an indi­ca­tor of eco­nomic in­equal­ity,” said Mr Bran­don Rees, deputy di­rec­tor of cor­po­ra­tions and cap­i­tal mar­kets at the AFL-CIO. “These CEO pay­ments re­flect that re­al­ity.”</p>
    <p>For decades, cor­po­rate boards have tried to tie ex­ec­u­tive pay to the per­for­mance of the com­pany’s stock in an ef­fort to make man­agers more ac­count­able to share­hold­ers.</p>
    <p>Mr Stack’s com­pen­sa­tion shows how top ex­ec­u­tives can rack up such large gains so quickly.</p>
    <p>In March, when the stock mar­ket was close to its low point and the share price for Dick’s Sport­ing Goods was also at a nadir, he re­ceived 355 per cent more stock op­tions for his 2020 award than for his 2019 grant and 142 per cent more re­stricted shares, ac­cord­ing to the ISS analysis and the com­pany’s securities fil­ings.</p>
    <p>The ISS analysis cov­ers top ex­ec­u­tives whose pay de­tails are in­cluded in com­pa­nies’ prox­ies, doc­u­ments that pub­licly traded busi­nesses file with the Securities and Ex­change Com­mis­sion an­nu­ally.</p>
    <p>Not all ex­ec­u­tives have gains on their 2020 grants be­cause many com­pa­nies have strug­gled in the pan­demic. In its sur­vey, which cov­ers 2020 grants made by com­pa­nies in the Rus­sell 3000 stock in­dex, ISS found that 1,675 “named ex­ec­u­tive of­fi­cers”, or the ex­ec­u­tives who ap­pear in prox­ies, had gains, while 1,388 had losses, as of Wed­nes­day’s clos­ing stock prices. The av­er­age ap­pre­ci­a­tion was nearly US$1.5 mil­lion and the av­er­age loss US$827,000.</p>
    <p>The chief ex­ec­u­tives of tech­nol­ogy com­pa­nies, many of which have thrived dur­ing the pan­demic, have done par­tic­u­larly well. Their av­er­age gain on 2020 grants was US$3.2 mil­lion, while the av­er­age loss was US$543,000.</p>
