    <p>The con­di­tions may not be ideal, but par­ents can still make sure their child’s Kin­der­garten 2 con­cert has “mean­ing­ful clo­sure”, says Mrs Dianne Seet, prin­ci­pal of The As­cen­sion Kin­der­garten, which has 145 grad­u­ates this year.</p>
    <p>She sug­gests the fol­low­ing tips for live-streamed and recorded cer­e­monies.</p>
    <p>LIVE-STREAMED CON­CERTS Tech­ni­cal prepa­ra­tion is</p>
    <p>key: Make sure you have a strong Wi-Fi sig­nal and that your de­vice has a large enough screen so you can spot your child, who may be wear­ing a mask or face shield. Avoid us­ing more than one de­vice in the room to avoid au­dio feed­back.</p>
    <p>Be­fore the event: Give your child a hug and share words of en­cour­age­ment. Let your kid know that you will be sup­port­ing him or her as you watch the pro­ceed­ings.</p>
    <p>Af­ter the cer­e­mony:</p>
    <p>Re­ceive them with joy and ask them how they felt. Teach them to re­flect on it without judg­ing them – no mat­ter how the ex­pe­ri­ence went, there is some­thing to learn.</p>
    <p>PRE-RECORDED CON­CERTS</p>
    <p>Make it fam­ily time: Ar­range to watch the cer­e­mony as a fam­ily and af­firm your child on how he or she has grown.</p>
    <p>Re­flect with your child:</p>
    <p>K2 chil­dren are ma­ture enough to re­flect on their ex­pe­ri­ences, so use this op­por­tu­nity to talk about how they dis­played val­ues like per­se­ver­ance and re­silience while they were pre­par­ing for the grad­u­a­tion. These life skills will serve your kid well as he or she en­ters pri­mary school.</p>
