    <p>SAN FRAN­CISCO • United States of­fi­cials said they now have cus­tody of a Chi­nese re­searcher who had taken shel­ter at the coun­try’s con­sulate in San Fran­cisco af­ter she was charged with try­ing to hide her mil­i­tary back­ground.</p>
    <p>Of­fi­cials brief­ing re­porters de­clined to dis­cuss the cir­cum­stances of the ar­rest of Tang Juan, a re­searcher at the Univer­sity of Cal­i­for­nia at Davis who was ac­cused of ly­ing on her US visa ap­pli­ca­tion.</p>
    <p>Tang be­came a flash point in de­te­ri­o­rat­ing US-China re­la­tions when fed­eral prose­cu­tors de­clared her a fugi­tive last Thurs­day and a spokesman for the Chi­nese For­eign Min­istry called her a vic­tim of “po­lit­i­cal per­se­cu­tion”. She is set to ap­pear in fed­eral court in Sacra­mento to­mor­row.</p>
    <p>The Jus­tice De­part­ment is in­ves­ti­gat­ing uni­ver­si­ties across the US in an at­tempt to un­cover mem­bers of China’s mil­i­tary forces who it says are hid­ing in plain sight.</p>
    <p>“These mem­bers of China’s Peo­ple’s Lib­er­a­tion Army ap­plied for re­search visas while hid­ing their true af­fil­i­a­tion with the PLA,” As­sis­tant At­tor­ney-Gen­eral for Na­tional Se­cu­rity John De­mers said in a state­ment.</p>
    <p>Days af­ter US agents in­ter­viewed Tang last month, prose­cu­tors filed a crim­i­nal complaint against her in fed­eral court, un­der seal. Prose­cu­tors said in a court fil­ing this month that the Chi­nese con­sulate in San Fran­cisco pro­vides “a po­ten­tial safe har­bour for a PLA of­fi­cial in­tent on avoid­ing pros­e­cu­tion in the US”.</p>
    <p>The Jus­tice De­part­ment said in a state­ment that the Fed­eral Bureau of In­ves­ti­ga­tion has in­ter­viewed other visa hold­ers sus­pected of hav­ing an “un­de­clared af­fil­i­a­tion” with the Chi­nese mil­i­tary in more than 25 Amer­i­can cities.</p>
    <p>The crim­i­nal complaint against Tang, un­sealed on July 20 in a Sacra­mento fed­eral court, ac­cused her of falsely deny­ing con­nec­tions to the Chi­nese mil­i­tary and the Chi­nese Com­mu­nist Party. Tang ap­plied for a US visa last Oc­to­ber to study cancer treat­ments at the state univer­sity cam­pus lo­cated just out­side of Sacra­mento.</p>
    <p>An FBI agent said in the complaint that Tang had ap­par­ent con­nec­tions to the mil­i­tary, based on an In­ter­net search of news ar­ti­cles. Agents in­ter­viewed her at her apart­ment in Davis last month and seized elec­tronic ma­te­rial un­der a search war­rant.</p>
    <p>Tang de­nied any con­nec­tion to the mil­i­tary or the Com­mu­nist Party, but agents found a pho­to­graph of her in mil­i­tary uni­form in the elec­tronic ma­te­rial.</p>
    <p>Tang told the agents she was re­quired to wear the uni­form to at­tend med­i­cal school be­cause it was run by the mil­i­tary. They also found an ap­pli­ca­tion for gov­ern­ment ben­e­fits in which she listed her po­lit­i­cal af­fil­i­a­tion as a Com­mu­nist Party mem­ber, ac­cord­ing to the agent’s af­fi­davit.</p>
