    <p>More than 500 Mus­lim stu­dents and youth re­ceived awards for their achieve­ments from self-help group Yayasan Men­daki yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The an­nual event, which was held vir­tu­ally this year, cel­e­brates stu­dents who have dis­played an ex­cep­tional aca­demic per­for­mance or ex­celled in a dif­fer­ent area of life.</p>
    <p>Min­is­ter-in-charge of Mus­lim Af­fairs and Men­daki chair­man Masagos Zulkifli, who was the guest of hon­our at the event, ap­plauded the re­cip­i­ents for their achieve­ments and urged mem­bers of the com­mu­nity to stay con­nected with Men­daki so they may re­ceive in­for­ma­tion and sup­port that will help them pre­pare for what lies ahead.</p>
    <p>Said Mr Masagos: “Given the uncer­tain times, some of you who grad­u­ated re­cently may be fac­ing dif­fi­cul­ties se­cur­ing your ideal jobs. As a re­silient com­mu­nity, I en­cour­age you to keep an open mind and lever­age avail­able op­por­tu­ni­ties, such as the SGUnited Trainee­ship pro­gramme, to gain ex­pe­ri­ence, en­hance your skills and build your net­works and port­fo­lios.”</p>
    <p>Four re­cip­i­ents were recog­nised for their con­tri­bu­tions to the com­mu­nity. They re­ceived the Anugerah Gemi­lang Men­daki (Pin­na­cle Award) for em­body­ing char</p>
    <p>SEIZE OP­POR­TU­NI­TIES</p>
    <p>ac­ter, com­pe­tence and cit­i­zenry. Among them was Mr Muham­mad Is­mail Shogo Sahul Hamid, a trained be­frien­der at in­mate re­ha­bil­i­ta­tion ini­tia­tive Fam­ily and In­mates Through-care As­sis­tance Haven (Fi­trah).</p>
    <p>Mr Is­mail, 26, is cur­rently pur­su­ing a trainee­ship at the Na­tional Univer­sity of Sin­ga­pore’s (NUS) Cen­tre for Fam­ily and Pop­u­la­tion Re­search.</p>
    <p>As an un­der­grad­u­ate stu­dent read­ing po­lit­i­cal sci­ence at NUS last year, Mr Is­mail was keen on un­der­stand­ing crim­i­nal­ity and the ground re­al­i­ties of con­victs.</p>
    <p>He signed up for Fi­trah’s train­ing pro­gramme, jug­gling the ses­sions with his stud­ies.</p>
    <p>Be­fore Covid-19 dis­rupted oper­a­tions, Mr Is­mail con­ducted home vis­its, as­sess­ing in­mates’ needs and work­ing with in­car­cer­ated in­di­vid­u­als and with fam­i­lies who have mem­bers on death row.</p>
    <p>Con­trast­ing his ex­pe­ri­ence in the class­room and at the grass­roots level, Mr Is­mail said: “When we study re­ha­bil­i­ta­tion or rein­te­gra­tion in univer­sity, we take a the­o­ret­i­cal ap­proach, but through Fi­trah, I was able to un­der­stand the is­sues on the ground and gather a new per­spec­tive about how to help these vul­ner­a­ble groups.”</p>
    <p>Given the uncer­tain times, some of you who grad­u­ated re­cently may be fac­ing dif­fi­cul­ties se­cur­ing your ideal jobs.</p>
    <p>As a re­silient com­mu­nity, I en­cour­age you to keep an open mind and lever­age avail­able op­por­tu­ni­ties, such as the SGUnited Trainee­ship pro­gramme, to gain ex­pe­ri­ence, en­hance your skills and build your net­works and port­fo­lios.</p>
    <p>MR MASAGOS ZULKIFLI, Min­is­ter-in-charge of Mus­lim Af­fairs and Men­daki chair­man, who was the guest of hon­our at the event.</p>
