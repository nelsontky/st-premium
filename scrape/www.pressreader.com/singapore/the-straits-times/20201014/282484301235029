    <p>With the pan­demic still rag­ing and the econ­omy bat­tered, many con­sumers are likely to be tight­en­ing their purse strings.</p>
    <p>Per­haps keep­ing that in mind, Sam­sung has de­liv­ered a “lite” ver­sion of its flag­ship smart­phone – the Gal­axy S20 FE. This “Fan Edi­tion” gets an $800 price cut from the flag­ship S20 Ul­tra ($1,898) launched in March.</p>
    <p>This means Sam­sung has had to shed some fea­tures from the S20 Ul­tra. The FE comes with 8GB of sys­tem mem­ory in­stead of the 12GB found in the S20 Ul­tra; a low­er­res­o­lu­tion dis­play, at 2,400 x 1,080 pix­els in­stead of 3,200 x 1,400 pix­els; a plas­tic rear in­stead of the more durable Go­rilla Glass and an op­ti­cal in-dis­play fin­ger­print sen­sor in­stead of an ul­tra­sonic one.</p>
    <p>The cam­era also gets a down­grade. The S20 FE fea­tures a rear triple-cam­era sys­tem in­stead of S20 Ul­tra’s quad-cam­era sys­tem, which has a high-res­o­lu­tion 108-megapixel (MP) wide-an­gle cam­era. The S20 FE’s tele­photo cam­era has only a 3x op­ti­cal zoom, com­pared with the S20 Ul­tra’s 4x op­ti­cal zoom.</p>
    <p>Images shot by the S20 FE are good, but not as good as those taken by the flag­ship model. I snap pho­tos of a scene on the same day us­ing both phones and find that the one taken by the S20 FE is not as sharp as the other.</p>
    <p>But the S20 FE’s night mode fea­ture is on a par with the flag­ship’s, with pho­tos taken by both phones of the same night scene show­ing lit­tle dif­fer­ence in qual­ity.</p>
    <p>The S20 FE comes in six colours – blue (tested here), red, laven­der, green, white and orange. The S20 Ul­tra is avail­able only in grey and black.</p>
    <p>Re­gard­less of the colour you choose, you get a nice matte rear fin­ish that is re­sis­tant to fin­ger­prints and smudges. Plus, there is not much of a cam­era bulge at the back, un­like the flag­ship phones.</p>
    <p>I also like that the S20 FE’s flat dis­play has no curved sides, which pre­vents ac­ci­den­tal touch­ing of the screen. And, with the smaller dis­play, one-handed us­age is more deft than with gi­ant smart­phones such as the S20 Ul­tra or Sam­sung Gal­axy Note20 Ul­tra.</p>
    <p>The S20 FE fea­tures Qual­comm’s high-end Snap­dragon 865 pro­ces­sor and sup­ports 5G net­works, but only the Sub-6GHz band­width and not the mmWave band­width.</p>
    <p>It is also rated at IP68, mean­ing that it is wa­ter-re­sis­tant to a depth of 1.5m for 30 min­utes. In other words, it can with­stand a drop into the pool.</p>
    <p>The S20 FE has an op­ti­cal in­dis­play fin­ger­print sen­sor, which is sup­posed to be slower in recog­nis­ing fin­ger­prints than the ul­tra­sonic one in the S20 Ul­tra. How­ever, I find that the op­ti­cal sen­sor works just as well.</p>
    <p>On the down­side, the bezels of the S20 FE dis­play are vis­i­bly thick com­pared with its al­most bezel­less flag­ship cousins.</p>
    <p>You can set the dis­play’s re­fresh rate at be­tween the stan­dard 60Hz and the much smoother 120Hz.</p>
    <p>De­spite the lower res­o­lu­tion, the dis­play still looks great, with vivid colours and sharp de­tails. I can feel the smooth­ness of the 120Hz re­fresh rate when play­ing games – for ex­am­ple, when throw­ing a Poke­ball in the Poke­mon Go mo­bile game. In-game tran­si­tions also load faster.</p>
    <p>Shooter games such as Free Fire and rac­ing games such as As­phalt 9 also feel smooth and speedy.</p>
    <p>Per­for­mance-wise, the S20 FE is al­most on a par with the S20 Ul­tra. In the Geek­bench 5 bench­mark tests, the S20 FE chalks up 903 (sin­glecore) and 3,191 (multi-core). In com­par­i­son, the S20 Ul­tra scores 917 (sin­gle-core) and 2,769 (multi-core).</p>
    <p>Apps launch quickly and I do not ex­pe­ri­ence lags in any of the op­er­a­tions I try, be they mo­bile Web browsers or so­cial me­dia apps.</p>
    <p>Packed with a bat­tery of 4,500mAh – lower than the S20 Ul­tra’s 5,000mAh – the S20 FE has a bat­tery life that is, pre­dictably, not as good as other mod­els’.</p>
    <p>With the dis­play set at the stan­dard re­fresh rate of 60Hz, the S20 FE clocks 17 hours and 40 min­utes – an hour less than the S20 Ul­tra.</p>
    <p>Still, its bat­tery life is bet­ter than most smart­phones. Af­ter my 12-hour work day with reg­u­lar check­ing of e-mails, Face­book and In­sta­gram, there is still around 55 per cent of juice left.</p>
