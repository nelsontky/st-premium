    <p>• Once the epi­cen­tre of the coro­n­avirus out­break in the US, New York has suc­cess­fully brought the num­ber of cases down.</p>
    <p>But as re­stric­tions be­gin to re­lax, young New York­ers are flout­ing so­cial dis­tanc­ing rules and par­ty­ing as if the pan­demic never hap­pened, threat­en­ing to cre­ate a sec­ond wave of in­fec­tions.</p>
    <p>New York City en­tered a lim­ited fourth phase of re­open­ing last week, al­low­ing some art and en­ter­tain­ment venues such as zoos and botan­i­cal gar­dens to open for out­door ac­tiv­i­ties at a lim­ited ca­pac­ity.</p>
    <p>But it has paused the re­open­ing of venues for in­door ac­tiv­i­ties such as gyms, malls, movie the­atres, mu­se­ums and in­door din­ing places.</p>
    <p>As the lock­down eases, peo­ple have been seen flout­ing so­cial dis­tanc­ing rules and gath­er­ing out­side restau­rants and bars sans masks.</p>
    <p>Such be­hav­iour threat­ens to undo the work in stem­ming the spread of the coro­n­avirus, which at its height saw more than 14,000 peo­ple in hos­pi­tals and a daily death toll of more than 1,000.</p>
    <p>On Thurs­day, the state re­ported 811 new cases, with a pos­i­tive rate of 1.16 per cent, and 13 deaths.</p>
    <p>Though new cases, hos­pi­tal­i­sa­tions and deaths have de­clined, pos­i­tive coro­n­avirus tests are on the rise for peo­ple in their 20s and 30s.</p>
    <p>New York Gov­er­nor An­drew Cuomo said at a brief­ing on Thurs­day that the pro­por­tion of peo­ple aged 21 to 30 who tested pos­i­tive for the virus had in­creased from 9.9 per cent to 13.2 per cent over the past two weeks.</p>
    <p>One clus­ter in Al­bany, the cap­i­tal of New York state, saw nearly 30 pos­i­tive cases linked to a Fourth of July party.</p>
    <p>To crack down on out­door min­gling, new rules were an­nounced ban­ning es­tab­lish­ments from sell­ing al­co­hol to cus­tomers who do not also buy food.</p>
    <p>On Wed­nes­day, the state gov­ern­ment sus­pended 27 li­cences and brought 410 charges against bars and restau­rants which al­lowed large crowds to gather and vi­o­lated so­cial dis­tanc­ing reg­u­la­tions, ac­cord­ing to ABC7.</p>
    <p>Mr Cuomo on Mon­day warned of a po­ten­tial roll­back on the re­open­ings of bars and restau­rants if the gath­er­ings of young peo­ple across the state were “get­ting worse”.</p>
    <p>“Don’t be stupid. What they are do­ing is stupid and reck­less for them­selves and for other peo­ple. And it has to stop,” he said.</p>
    <p>The out­break in the United States re­mains on a trou­bling tra­jec­tory, sur­pass­ing the grim mile­stone of four mil­lion in­fec­tions on Thurs­day, when more than 1,000 deaths from Covid-19 were also recorded for the third straight day.</p>
    <p>Fa­tal­i­ties na­tion­wide stood at 1,014 on Thurs­day, with not all states re­port­ing. There were 1,135 deaths on Wed­nes­day, and 1,141 on Tues­day.</p>
    <p>The coun­try took 98 days to reach one mil­lion con­firmed cases of Covid-19, but just 16 days for the fig­ure to in­crease from three mil­lion to four mil­lion, ac­cord­ing to a Reuters tally.</p>
    <p>The av­er­age num­ber of new cases is now ris­ing by more than 2,600 per hour na­tion­wide, the high­est rate in the world.</p>
    <p>Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump told a White House brief­ing on Thurs­day that hot spot states may need to de­lay the re­open­ing of schools by a few weeks, but pushed for most stu­dents to be able to re­turn to class­rooms in the au­tumn.</p>
    <p>“They have to open,” he said.</p>
    <p>The US Cen­tres for Dis­ease Con­trol and Preven­tion is­sued ad­di­tional guide­lines on how schools can safely re­open. These in­clude a call for stu­dents to stay 2m apart from one an­other where feasible, and to bring meals from home and eat in class­rooms in­stead of the lunch­room.</p>
    <p>Schools were closed across the coun­try af­ter the coro­n­avirus emerged and be­gan spread­ing, and Mr Trump has been de­ter­mined to find a way to get them to open again.</p>
    <p>De­spite pres­sure from Mr Trump, only one in four Amer­i­cans thinks it is safe for pub­lic schools to re­open this au­tumn, and four in 10 par­ents said they would likely keep their chil­dren home if classes re­sume, ac­cord­ing to a Reuters/Ip­sos poll last week.</p>
