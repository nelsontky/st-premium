    <p>TOKYO • Oil rose around 1 per cent yes­ter­day, ex­tend­ing a sharp rally overnight that saw Brent rise above US$50 for the first time since March, as coro­n­avirus vac­cine roll-outs kept hopes alive that de­mand for crude would build up next year.</p>
    <p>Brent was up 45 US cents, or 0.9 per cent, at US$50.70 a bar­rel by 0121 GMT, af­ter gain­ing nearly 3 per cent on Thurs­day. US oil was up 50 US cents, or 1 per cent, at US$47.28, hav­ing also risen al­most 3 per cent in the pre­vi­ous ses­sion.</p>
    <p>That leaves prices set for a sixth con­sec­u­tive week of gains as promis­ing vac­cine tri­als helped quell gloom over record in­creases in the num­ber of new Covid-19 in­fec­tions and deaths world­wide.</p>
    <p>Bri­tain be­gan in­oc­u­la­tions this week and the United States could start vac­ci­na­tions as early as the com­ing week­end, while Canada on Wed­nes­day ap­proved its first vac­cine with ini­tial shots due from next week.</p>
    <p>“The re­cov­ery from the pan­demic will ac­cel­er­ate once a vac­cine is widely avail­able, fur­ther sup­ported by on­go­ing fis­cal and mone­tary stim­u­lus from gov­ern­ments around the world,” ANZ Re­search said in a note.</p>
    <p>Out­side ad­vis­ers for the US Food and Drug Ad­min­is­tra­tion have voted to en­dorse emer­gency use of Pfizer’s vac­cine, paving the way for the agency to au­tho­rise its use to in­oc­u­late a na­tion that has</p>

    <p>lost more than 285,000 lives to the coro­n­avirus.</p>
    <p>“The broad mar­ket rally is ex­pected to con­tinue next year, with com­modi­ties set for a pos­i­tive year amid an im­prov­ing eco­nomic back­drop,” ANZ said.</p>
    <p>A big jump in US crude stock­piles served as a re­minder that there is still plenty of sup­ply avail­able, but that was all but ig­nored as bulls ran through the mar­ket this week.</p>
