    <p>Pa­tients who are newly di­ag­nosed with the hu­man im­mun­od­e­fi­ciency virus (HIV) will no longer have to wait up to eight weeks be­fore start­ing treat­ment.</p>
    <p>In­stead, wait­ing time for treat­ment with life-sav­ing an­tiretro­vi­ral med­i­ca­tion has been cut to up to four days.</p>
    <p>The Na­tional University Hospi­tal (NUH) is the first hospi­tal to start the same-day an­tiretro­vi­ral ther­apy (ART) pro­gramme, which be­gan on Sept 1 at the hospi­tal’s Mul­ti­dis­ci­plinary In­fec­tious Dis­eases Clinic.</p>
    <p>Dr Dar­iusz Piotr Ol­szyna, HIV pro­gramme direc­tor at NUH, ex­plained that ob­tain­ing early treat­ment will help to re­duce the anx­i­ety of newly di­ag­nosed pa­tients and also lower the risk of HIV trans­mis­sion in the com­mu­nity.</p>
    <p>This pro­gramme will bring NUH closer to its goal of end­ing the HIV epi­demic in Sin­ga­pore by 2030, he added.</p>
    <p>The first pa­tient was en­rolled last Tues­day.</p>
    <p>Speak­ing to The Straits Times on con­di­tion of anonymity, the pa­tient re­layed feel­ing pos­i­tive and less anx­ious after tak­ing the med­i­ca­tion, and hoped to achieve the tar­get re­sult of an un­de­tectable vi­ral load as soon as pos­si­ble.</p>
    <p>Dr Ol­szyna, who is also head and se­nior con­sul­tant at the di­vi­sion of ad­vanced in­ter­nal medicine in NUH, ad­vised those who are sex­u­ally ac­tive to go for reg­u­lar HIV tests as test­ing is the only way to de­ter­mine if they have been in­fected.</p>
    <p>“Peo­ple who should be of­fered reg­u­lar test­ing are those who have mul­ti­ple sex­ual part­ners, men who have sex with men, peo­ple who pay or are paid for sex, peo­ple who in­ject drugs and sex­ual part­ners of all these in­di­vid­u­als,” said Dr Ol­szyna.</p>
    <p>The fre­quency for HIV tests de­pends on the num­ber of sex­ual part­ners.</p>
    <p>Some may need to be tested ev­ery three months, Dr Ol­szyna said. It takes on av­er­age about two to four weeks for symp­toms of an acute HIV in­fec­tion to de­velop, but for some pa­tients it may be months be­fore signs of an in­fec­tion show up.</p>
    <p>Cur­rently, in­di­vid­u­als who sus­pect that they might have con­tracted HIV can get tested at anony­mous test­ing clin­ics, poly­clin­ics or the hospi­tal.</p>
    <p>A screen­ing test is first taken, and if the re­sult is re­ac­tive – sug­gest­ing a pos­i­tive di­ag­no­sis – the blood sam­ple un­der­goes con­fir­ma­tion test­ing.</p>
    <p>Screen­ing test re­sults are gen­er­ally avail­able on the same day, but the con­fir­ma­tion test can take up to two weeks to pro­duce a re­sult. This wait time of­ten leads to much anx­i­ety.</p>
    <p>Pa­tients who have a pos­i­tive di­ag­no­sis from the screen­ing test can re­quest to be en­rolled un­der the new pro­gramme. They will be re­ferred</p>
    <p>to the HIV clinic in NUH and of­fered an ap­point­ment within 96 hours of the pos­i­tive screen­ing test.</p>
    <p>While wait­ing for the con­fir­ma­tion test re­sults, they will re­ceive a com­pre­hen­sive as­sess­ment and also coun­selling.</p>
    <p>These pa­tients will also be given the op­tion to start ART be­fore their con­fir­ma­tion test re­sults are out.</p>
    <p>ART helps HIV-pos­i­tive pa­tients sup­press their vi­ral l oad till it reaches a stage where it be­comes “un­de­tectable” – a level so low that cur­rent test­ing meth­ods are un­able to de­tect the virus in the blood.</p>
    <p>Those with un­de­tectable vi­ral loads are said to be un­able to trans­mit the virus to their sex­ual part­ners.</p>
    <p>The ther­apy al­lows peo­ple liv­ing with HIV to have vir­tu­ally the same life ex­pectancy as those with­out HIV, Dr Ol­szyna stressed.</p>
    <p>“It is great news for the gen­eral pop­u­la­tion es­pe­cially if they have fam­ily, friends, or a spouse who is HIV pos­i­tive and ex­pe­ri­ences anx­i­ety while wait­ing for treat­ment.</p>
    <p>“They can be as­sured that their loved ones are taken care of by our doc­tors and con­tinue to live nor­mally once the treat­ment is ini­ti­ated.”</p>
    <p>Most peo­ple in­fected with the virus will have sig­nif­i­cant symp­toms only after they reach the more ad­vanced stages as the symp­toms of acute HIV are of­ten missed, be­cause they re­sem­ble other com­mon vi­ral in­fec­tions.</p>
    <p>These symp­toms in­clude headaches, fa­tigue, sore throats, night sweats and a loss of ap­petite.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to the Min­istry of Health, there were 323 new cases of HIV in­fec­tions re­ported among Sin­ga­pore res­i­dents last year. This brings the to­tal num­ber of HIV-in­fected Sin­ga­pore res­i­dents to 8,618 as at end-2019, of whom 2,097 have died.</p>
    <p>The num­ber of new HIV cases among Sin­ga­pore res­i­dents has been be­tween 400 and 500 per year from 2007 to 2017 and about 310 to 330 in 2018 and last year.</p>
    <p>The pub­lic can find out more in­for­ma­tion on the pro­gramme by con­tact­ing the team at nuh_midc @nuhs.edu.sg or di­alling 91862310.</p>
