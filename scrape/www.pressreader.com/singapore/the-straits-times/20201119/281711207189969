    <p>SYD­NEY • South Aus­tralia yes­ter­day de­clared a six-day lock­down to stamp out what the state premier de­scribed as a highly con­ta­gious out­break of the coro­n­avirus dis­ease that of­fi­cials linked to a re­turned trav­eller from Bri­tain.</p>
    <p>Most busi­nesses will close ex­cept for some food out­lets, and peo­ple will be largely con­fined to their homes, as the state tries to avoid a more se­vere out­break like the one that all but shut­tered neigh­bour­ing Vic­to­ria for more than 100 days.</p>
    <p>“We need this cir­cuit breaker, this com­mu­nity pause,” South Aus­tralian Premier Steven Mar­shall told the me­dia yes­ter­day. “We are go­ing hard and we are go­ing early. Time is of the essence and we must act swiftly and de­ci­sively.”</p>
    <p>The south­ern state, home to just un­der 1.8 mil­lion peo­ple, re­ported two new cases yes­ter­day, tak­ing the to­tal to 22. The clus­ter started to emerge at the week­end, rep­re­sent­ing the first se­ri­ous signs of com­mu­nity trans­mis­sion in South Aus­tralia since mid-April.</p>
    <p>While the case num­bers re­main mod­est, Mr Mar­shall said the state needed to act quickly be­cause the iden­ti­fied virus strain was “highly con­ta­gious with short in­cu­ba­tion pe­riod and lim­ited symp­toms”.</p>
    <p>The au­thor­i­ties said yes­ter­day that a ho­tel cleaner con­tracted the virus from a quar­an­tined re­turned trav­eller from Bri­tain.</p>
    <p>The cleaner then spread the virus to her ex­tended fam­ily in Ade­laide, the state’s cap­i­tal city.</p>
    <p>It was tak­ing 24 hours or less for a newly in­fected per­son to be­come</p>
    <p>in­fec­tious to oth­ers, the au­thor­i­ties said.</p>
    <p>The lock­down, to take ef­fect from mid­night yes­ter­day, will mean peo­ple will be re­stricted from go­ing out­side of their homes, with only one per­son per house­hold al­lowed to leave each day, but for only spe­cific pur­poses.</p>
    <p>Masks will be re­quired in all ar­eas out­side of the home.</p>
    <p>All schools, take­away food out­lets, pubs, cafes and uni­ver­si­ties will be closed, along with the con­struc­tion in­dus­try, which has been al­lowed to op­er­ate dur­ing past lock­downs in Aus­tralia.</p>
    <p>Else­where, Vic­to­ria state, which was the epi­cen­tre of Aus­tralia’s nearly 28,000 cases un­til last month, clocked its 19th straight day of zero new cases. New South Wales, of which Syd­ney is the cap­i­tal city, re­ported zero lo­cal and seven im­ported cases.</p>
