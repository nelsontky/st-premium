    <p>Twelve new coro­n­avirus cases were re­ported here yes­ter­day, bring­ing the to­tal num­ber to 58,015.</p>
    <p>The Min­istry of Health (MOH) said all 12 were im­ported cases who were placed on stay-home no­tices upon ar­rival here. There were no new com­mu­nity cases yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>All but one of the new cases were asymp­to­matic, and were picked up as a re­sult of the min­istry’s proac­tive screen­ing and sur­veil­lance.</p>
    <p>Two cases were Sin­ga­pore­ans who had re­turned from In­done­sia and the United States. One of the other cases was a per­ma­nent res­i­dent who had re­turned from In­done­sia, while an­other was a de­pen­dant’s pass holder from Greece.</p>
    <p>Of the re­main­ing eight cases, two were work per­mit hold­ers re­turn­ing from the Philip­pines, and the other six were work per­mit hold­ers from In­done­sia.</p>
    <p>MOH said that all close con­tacts of the cases have been iso­lated and placed on quar­an­tine, and will be tested at the start and end of their quar­an­tine pe­riod to pick up any asymp­to­matic cases. Sero­log­i­cal tests will also be car­ried out on close con­tacts to see if any of the 12 could have been in­fected by them.</p>
    <p>MOH also an­nounced that the clus­ter at Kian Teck Dor­mi­tory has been closed as there have been no more cases linked to it for the past 28 days.</p>
    <p>The num­ber of new cases in the com­mu­nity has de­creased from three cases the week be­fore to two in the past week, said MOH.</p>
    <p>The num­ber of un­linked cases in the com­mu­nity also fell from three to two in the same pe­riod. With four cases dis­charged yes­ter­day, 57,898 pa­tients have fully re­cov­ered from the dis­ease. A to­tal of 42 pa­tients re­main in hos­pi­tal, with none in in­ten­sive care, while 32 are re­cu­per­at­ing in com­mu­nity fa­cil­i­ties.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore has had 28 deaths from Covid-19 com­pli­ca­tions, while 15 who tested pos­i­tive have died of other causes.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, the Na­tional Uni­ver­sity of Sin­ga­pore (NUS) an­nounced that it would lift zon­ing re­stric­tions from Dec 6 in the wake of the low num­ber of com­mu­nity cases in re­cent weeks. Five self-suf­fi­cient zones were cre­ated on NUS cam­puses in June to min­imise over­crowd­ing and in­ter­min­gling.</p>
    <p>Separately, MOH an­nounced yes­ter­day that two in­fluenza vac­cines, which had been sus­pended af­ter peo­ple who re­ceived them in South Korea died, could be used again.</p>
    <p>MOH said the vac­cines, SKYCellflu Quadri­va­lent and Vax­i­gripTe­tra, had been as­sessed to be safe for use fol­low­ing a thor­ough re­view of i nfor­ma­tion from the South Korean health au­thor­i­ties, as well as fur­ther re­view by the Health Sci­ences Author­ity here.</p>
