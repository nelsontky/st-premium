    <p>The Gov­ern­ment has mod­er­ately in­creased the sup­ply of land for pri­vate homes but has kept the com­mer­cial and ho­tel sites un­changed for the first half of next year, as un­sold home stocks fell and some de­vel­op­ers are start­ing to buy land via col­lec­tive sales.</p>
    <p>The uptick in res­i­den­tial sup­ply from con­firmed sites un­der the Gov­ern­ment Land Sales (GLS) pro­gramme for the first half of next year fol­lows sharp cuts in the sec­ond half of this year ow­ing to the coro­n­avirus pan­demic.</p>
    <p>The pri­vate home sup­ply of 1,605 units from four con­firmed list sites rose by 235 units or about 17 per cent from a five-year low of 1,370 units in the sec­ond half of the 2020 GLS pro­gramme, ac­cord­ing to data re­leased yes­ter­day by the Min­istry of Na­tional De­vel­op­ment.</p>
    <p>The land sup­ply was “care­fully cal­i­brated to take into ac­count the Covid-19 and macroe­co­nomic sit­u­a­tion. Given the con­tin­ued un­cer­tain­ties in eco­nomic and labour mar­ket con­di­tions, the Gov­ern­ment has de­cided to main­tain a mod­er­ate sup­ply of pri­vate res­i­den­tial units on the con­firmed list”, the min­istry said.</p>
    <p>The con­firmed list in­cludes one ex­ec­u­tive con­do­minium (EC) site that can yield about 590 units. The other three sites also of­fer 9,200 sq m gross floor area (GFA) of com­mer­cial space.</p>
    <p>On the re­serve list are five pri­vate res­i­den­tial sites (in­clud­ing one EC site), three white sites – where a range of uses is al­lowed – and one ho­tel site.</p>
    <p>Th­ese re­serve list sites can yield about 5,440 pri­vate homes (in­clud­ing 700 EC units), 92,000 sq m GFA of com­mer­cial space and 1,070 ho­tel rooms.</p>
    <p>Mr Leonard Tay, head of re­search at Knight Frank Sin­ga­pore, said that if the eco­nomic re­cov­ery gains trac­tion next year and bor­ders around the world re­open, in­vest­ment in­ter­est could see one or more of th­ese white sites be­ing trig­gered.</p>
    <p>A to­tal of 7,045 pri­vate homes can thus be po­ten­tially de­vel­oped on the con­firmed and re­serve list sites. This is 5.6 per cent more than the 6,670 units un­der the GLS pro­gramme for the sec­ond half of this year.</p>
    <p>De­spite the cal­i­brated sup­ply, there are still choice sites on of­fer in both the con­firmed and re­serve lists to pre­vent the mar­ket from over­heat­ing, noted Mr Des­mond Sim, head of re­search for South-east Asia at CBRE.</p>
    <p>The con­firmed list for the first half of next year com­prises three pri­vate res­i­den­tial sites in Len­tor Cen­tral and Slim Bar­racks Rise as well as one EC site in Tampines Street 62.</p>
    <p>“The in­crease in res­i­den­tial units in­tro­duced will help to pro­vide a much-needed boost for de­vel­op­ers to shore up their land in­ven­tory, given that sup­ply from pre­vi­ous GLS sites has been rel­a­tively lim­ited,” Mr Sim said.</p>
    <p>“With healthy de­mand from new and re­sale mar­kets, cou­pled with de­clin­ing un­sold units, th­ese sites are likely to at­tract healthy bid­ding ac­tiv­ity, as ev­i­denced by the ten­ders of the pre­vi­ous two GLS sites (Tanah Merah Kechil Link and Yishun Av­enue 9).”</p>
    <p>An­a­lysts said the Slim Bar­racks Rise sites could be es­pe­cially ap­peal­ing to de­vel­op­ers be­cause they are lo­cated near the Buona Vista MRT sta­tion and sur­rounded by the one-north bio­med­i­cal and tech­nol­ogy hub.</p>
    <p>“De­mand for units there will be fur­ther boosted con­sid­er­ing the bright out­look for the bio­med­i­cal and tech­nol­ogy sec­tors, which have both ben­e­fited from the pan­demic,” said Ms Chris­tine Li, head of re­search for Sin­ga­pore and South-east Asia at Cush­man & Wakefield.</p>
    <p>Both sites are small and could at­tract many bid­ders ow­ing to their lower to­tal de­vel­op­ment costs, noted Mr Ong Teck Hui, se­nior di­rec­tor of re­search and con­sul­tancy at JLL.</p>
    <p>The Len­tor Cen­tral par­cel is lo­cated next to the up­com­ing Len­tor MRT sta­tion and can yield 610 pri­vate homes and 8,000 sq m of com­mer­cial space.</p>
    <p>Given the lim­ited num­ber of GLS sites, more de­vel­op­ers are ex­pected to con­sider sites of­fered via col­lec­tive sales as the healthy mo­men­tum in pri­vate home sales grows, Mr Ong said.</p>
    <p>But it will not be to the ex­tent of the col­lec­tive-sale fer­vour seen in 2017 and 2018, he added.</p>
