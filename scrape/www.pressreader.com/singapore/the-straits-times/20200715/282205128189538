    <p>More pri­vate non-landed homes were resold last month com­pared with May, while prices held for a third con­sec­u­tive month as Sin­ga­pore grad­u­ally re­opened its econ­omy af­ter a two-month cir­cuit breaker, ac­cord­ing to flash data re­leased yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The num­ber of con­do­mini­ums and pri­vate apart­ments resold in­creased to an es­ti­mated 497 units last month, a 174.6 per cent in­crease from the 181 units moved in May, the flash fig­ures from real es­tate por­tal SRX Prop­erty showed.</p>
    <p>Still, last month’s re­sale vol­ume was 26.3 per cent less than in the same month last year and 40.7 per cent lower than the five-year av­er­age vol­ume for the month.</p>
    <p>Head of re­search and con­sul­tancy at OrangeTee & Tie Chris­tine Sun said the sales vol­ume re­cov­ery was within ex­pec­ta­tions, given that house view­ings re­sumed af­ter the cir­cuit breaker ended last month.</p>
    <p>Ms Sun noted that the pri­vate re­sale mar­ket picked up quickly due to “tech­no­log­i­cal tools” which helped buy­ers short­list their op­tions dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker.</p>
    <p>“Vir­tual house tours and ‘e-open houses’ helped to speed up the buy­ing process for some as they could se­lect and short­list units re­motely prior to the re­sump­tion of house view­ings.”</p>
    <p>Last week, the SRX flash es­ti­mate for the Hous­ing Board re­sale mar­ket re­flected a sim­i­lar re­bound, where close to seven times more flats were sold last month com­pared with May.</p>
    <p>ERA Realty head of re­search and con­sul­tancy Ni­cholas Mak noted that the re­bound for re­sale con­do­mini­ums was “less spec­tac­u­lar” com­pared with that of the HDB re­sale mar­ket.</p>
    <p>This could be be­cause more first­time home buy­ers would buy an HDB flat than a pri­vate con­do­minium unit as the HDB flat is more af­ford­able, he said.</p>
    <p>“HDB flat buy­ers would feel a sense of ur­gency to buy their first homes. By com­par­i­son, some of the buy­ers of pri­vate re­sale con­do­minium units are HDB up­graders...There is a lower sense of ur­gency among these buy­ers.”</p>
    <p>Over­all, prices re­main un­changed month on month over May. Year on year, over­all prices dipped by 0.6 per cent last month.</p>
    <p>Last month’s re­sale prices for units in the core cen­tral re­gion (CCR) and rest of cen­tral re­gion (RCR) de­creased over May by 1.8 per cent and 1.1 per cent re­spec­tively. Units in the out­side cen­tral re­gion (OCR) in­creased by 1.4 per cent.</p>
    <p>Over half of the units resold last month were lo­cated in the OCR, at 52.3 per cent. Units in the CCR and the RCR made up 27.4 per cent and 20.3 per cent re­spec­tively.</p>
    <p>Last month’s over­all SRX’s trans­ac­tion over X-value (TOX) data stood at a neg­a­tive $10,000, no change from May’s num­ber.</p>
    <p>TOX mea­sures how much a buyer is over­pay­ing (pos­i­tive value) or un­der­pay­ing (neg­a­tive value) for a prop­erty based on SRX’s com­put­er­gen­er­ated mar­ket value. The data in­cludes only dis­tricts with more than 10 re­sale trans­ac­tions.</p>
    <p>District 23 (Dairy Farm/Bukit Panjang/Choa Chu Kang) posted the high­est me­dian TOX at pos­i­tive $5,000, fol­lowed by District 3 (Alexan­dra/Com­mon­wealth) at zero TOX. The low­est me­dian was found in District 9 (Or­chard/River Val­ley) and District 16 (Be­dok/Up­per East Coast) at neg­a­tive $80,000 and neg­a­tive $38,000 re­spec­tively.</p>
    <p>The high­est price for a re­sale unit last month was the $12.2 mil­lion paid for a unit at Sky­line @ Or­chard Boule­vard.</p>
    <p>Mr Mak said re­sale con­do­minium trans­ac­tion vol­umes could con­tinue to rise in the com­ing months, as 26,000 HDB flats com­plete their five-year min­i­mum oc­cu­pa­tion pe­riod this year.</p>
    <p>This would likely spur some up­graders’ de­mand for a com­pleted re­sale con­do­minium af­ter the sale of their HDB flats to avoid pay­ing the ad­di­tional buyer’s stamp duty.</p>
    <p>Mr Mak es­ti­mates 8,000 to 10,000 units to be trans­acted for this year, while prices could re­main flat with a slight down­ward bias.</p>
