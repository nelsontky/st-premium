    <p>• Chief Ex­ec­u­tive Car­rie Lam said Hong Kong will kick off a cam­paign to test its en­tire pop­u­la­tion for the coro­n­avirus on Sept 1, in the first such ef­fort at­tempted out­side of main­land China.</p>
    <p>Aided by Chi­nese ex­perts and labs, the blitz will last for as long as two weeks.</p>
    <p>All res­i­dents are en­ti­tled to a free, one-time test. Un­like sim­i­lar mass testing drives in the Chi­nese ci­ties of Wuhan and Dalian, this is on a vol­un­tary ba­sis.</p>
    <p>“Hong Kong will be much bet­ter equipped to deal with the pos­si­ble next virus wave now,” Mrs Lam said yes­ter­day af­ter­noon.</p>
    <p>She ex­pressed grat­i­tude to China, say­ing that Hong Kong would not have been able to con­duct mass testing on its own.</p>
    <p>The re­source-in­ten­sive ef­fort could help break hid­den chains of trans­mis­sion by de­tect­ing asymp­to­matic car­ri­ers, but it is un­clear how many peo­ple among the city’s pop­u­la­tion of over seven mil­lion will come for­ward for testing.</p>
    <p>As China tightens its grip over Hong Kong in the form of a con­tro­ver­sial national se­cu­rity law, the main­land-backed testing drive could pro­vide a gauge of mass sen­ti­ment to­wards grow­ing Chi­nese in­flu­ence in the city.</p>
    <p>“For your­self, for oth­ers, for pub­lic health, we hope more peo­ple can par­tic­i­pate,” said Mrs Lam.</p>
    <p>“We’ve not set our­selves any tar­get for to­tal testing num­bers. This test is com­pletely vol­un­tary,” she added.</p>
    <p>Early last month, af­ter a long stretch of virus-free life, Hong Kong’s worst out­break emerged that now ac­counts for over twothirds of its 4,600 cases in to­tal.</p>
    <p>Af­ter im­pos­ing its strictest so­cial dis­tanc­ing mea­sures, daily cases have steadily fallen, with 27 new in­fec­tions re­ported yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The lab­o­ra­tory costs for this mass testing drive will be cov­ered by the Chi­nese govern­ment while the Hong Kong au­thor­i­ties will pay for costs re­lated to sam­ple col­lec­tion, trans­port and pub­lic pro­mo­tion.</p>
    <p>The Hong Kong govern­ment plans to set up var­i­ous col­lec­tion cen­tres across the city’s dis­tricts, and nasal and throat swab sam­ples will be col­lected on site.</p>
    <p>Sam­ples will be dis­carded af­ter tests are com­pleted, Sec­re­tary for the Civil Ser­vice Pa­trick Nip said, and they will not be sent out­side Hong Kong.</p>
    <p>Ac­tivists had ear­lier raised con­cerns that China might use such a testing blitz to col­lect DNA data.</p>
    <p>An on­line booking sys­tem is be­ing in­tro­duced to avoid virus spread through over­crowd­ing, and the du­ra­tion of the testing drive can be ex­tended to as long as two weeks based on the de­mand. Chil­dren aged un­der six will not qual­ify for this free mass testing.</p>
    <p>Res­i­dents who test neg­a­tive will re­ceive a text mes­sage, while those with pos­i­tive re­sults will get a call from the health bureau to ar­range for hos­pi­tal­i­sa­tion.</p>
