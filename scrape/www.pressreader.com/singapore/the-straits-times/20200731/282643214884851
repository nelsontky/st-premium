    <p>PARIS • A re­searcher has claimed to have dis­cov­ered the ex­act spot where Vin­cent van Gogh painted his last can­vas be­fore his mys­te­ri­ous death from a gun­shot wound.</p>
    <p>The tor­tured Dutch artist had been work­ing on Tree Roots, a jumble of brightly coloured tree trunks, roots and stumps near Au­vers-sur-Oise, north of Paris, on a hot July day in 1890 when he stag­gered back, wounded, to the vil­lage inn.</p>
    <p>Dr Wouter van der Veen, of the Van Gogh In­sti­tute, which looks after the artist’s room at the Au­berge Ravoux where he spent his fi­nal 70 days, said most of the tan­gle of roots is still there, a stone’s throw from the inn.</p>
    <p>Ex­perts at the Van Gogh Mu­seum in Am­s­ter­dam have backed the find­ing, say­ing it was “an in­ter­pre­ta­tion, but it looks like it is in­deed true”.</p>
    <p>The mu­seum’s di­rec­tor Em­i­lie Gor­denker and the great-grand­son of van Gogh’s younger brother Theo trav­elled to the vil­lage on Tues­day to un­veil a plaque at the spot.</p>
    <p>Vin­cent and Theo – who had sup­ported his brother for much of his life and out­lived him by just six months – are buried next to each other in the vil­lage ceme­tery.</p>
    <p>Dr van der Veen said he made the break­through from a post­card of the vil­lage from the turn of the 20th cen­tury, which shows an em­bank­ment with the trees on the main road through the ham­let, 30km north of Paris.</p>
    <p>He was go­ing through some doc­u­ments dur­ing the coro­n­avirus lock­down when “my eye was caught by a de­tail from the post­card”.</p>
    <p>DIS­PROV­ING LONG-HELD THE­ORY</p>
    <p>The re­searcher com­pared it with the paint­ing and found that the trunks and roots cor­re­sponded.</p>
    <p>“Dis­cov­er­ing the place where van Gogh painted his last and most mys­te­ri­ous work is a wak­ing dream which I am still try­ing to com­pre­hend,” he added.</p>
    <p>Dr Teio Mee­den­dorp of the Van Gogh Mu­seum said the painter would have of­ten passed the spot “go­ing out to the fields be­hind the chateau of Au­vers where he painted in the last week of his life”.</p>
    <p>Be­cause of the way the light falls in the paint­ing, Dr van der Veen said van Gogh had prob­a­bly still been work­ing on it late in the af­ter­noon, “about 5pm or 6pm”.</p>
    <p>This, he ar­gued, could help dis­prove the con­tro­ver­sial the­ory that van Gogh had not killed him­self, but had been drunk and fought with two lo­cal boys who shot him by ac­ci­dent.</p>
    <p>The the­ory was first floated in a bi­og­ra­phy of the painter by Pulitzer Prize-win­ning au­thors Steven Naifeh and Gre­gory White Smith nine years ago, and fea­tured in the 2018 movie At Eter­nity’s Gate, star­ring Willem Dafoe.</p>
    <p>Its di­rec­tor, Amer­i­can painter Julian Schn­abel, said when the film was re­leased that van Gogh had prob­a­bly been mur­dered.</p>
    <p>He in­sisted that a man who had painted 75 can­vases in al­most as many days at Au­vers-sur-Oise was un­likely to be sui­ci­dal.</p>
    <p>Schn­abel also claimed the paint­ing ma­te­rial van Gogh had that day was never found. “It is strange to bury your s*** if you are com­mit­ting sui­cide,” he added.</p>
    <p>SYM­BOL OF LIFE’S STRUG­GLES</p>
    <p>But Dr van der Veen dis­missed the the­o­ries as “lousy”, in­sist­ing that for him, the paint­ing was van Gogh’s fi­nal “tes­ta­ment, a farewell let­ter... Sui­cide had been an op­tion for him for a year”.</p>
    <p>Van Gogh had been in an asy­lum near Ar­les and re­leased just three months ear­lier.</p>
    <p>“The thicket of roots was a sym­bol of the strug­gles of life. We cut down the tree and from their stumps new shoots ap­pear.</p>
    <p>“It makes sense, the theme of life and death, and elim­i­nates all these lousy the­o­ries which do lit­tle for his mem­ory,” Dr van der Veen said.</p>
    <p>The re­volver with which van Gogh is be­lieved to have shot him­self in the chest sold for €162,500 (S$263,000) at a Paris auc­tion last year.</p>
    <p>Dis­cov­ered in a field near the vil­lage, it was billed as “the most fa­mous weapon in the his­tory of art”.</p>
    <p>The rusty 7mm Le­faucheux had al­ready been ex­hib­ited at the Van Gogh Mu­seum in Am­s­ter­dam.</p>
    <p>While the Van Gogh In­sti­tute said the link with the painter could not be proven con­clu­sively, the bul­let ex­tracted from his stom­ach was the same cal­i­bre as the one used for the Le­faucheux re­volver.</p>
