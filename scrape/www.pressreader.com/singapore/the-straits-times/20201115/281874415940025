    <p>There is no re­li­able es­ti­mate but gov­ern­ment data in­di­cates that less than 3 per cent of mar­riages are in­ter-faith. That this plat­form res­onates with those seek­ing to marry out­side their com­mu­nity is ap­par­ent in some of the com­ments. One reads: “You guys re­store my faith in love. I wish to marry my Mus­lim boyfriend soon one day. You guys are a to­tal mo­ti­va­tion.”</p>
    <p>A Hindu woman hap­pily mar­ried to a Mus­lim man for nearly 20 years, Ms Priyadarsh­ini Naren­dra felt ex­as­per­ated by the fall­out around an ad for a pop­u­lar In­dian jew­ellery brand, Tan­ishq.</p>
    <p>The ad­ver­tise­ment, re­leased last month, fea­tured a baby shower or­gan­ised for a Hindu ex­pec­tant mother by her Mus­lim in-laws who had in­cor­po­rated Hindu rites to make their daugh­ter-in-law feel at home. It was meant to cel­e­brate love across bound­aries.</p>
    <p>In­stead, it fur­ther en­trenched di­vi­sions in In­dia.</p>
    <p>Some Hin­dus ar­gued that the ad pro­moted “love ji­had” – a term that ac­cuses Mus­lim men of plot­ting to se­duce Hindu women away from their re­li­gion. The com­mer­cial was with­drawn.</p>
    <p>Disil­lu­sioned by this grow­ing re­li­gious di­vide in In­dia, Ms Naren­dra de­cided to take ac­tion.</p>
    <p>The 50-year-old Hindu pro­fes­sional in Gur­gaon and her hus­band, Mr Ali Im­ran, 54, wrote about their love story and sent it to a newly launched so­cial me­dia ef­fort on In­sta­gram – the In­dia Love Project (ILP) – that doc­u­ments sto­ries of love and mar­riage “out­side the shack­les of faith, caste, eth­nic­ity, gen­der”.</p>
    <p>“I think this is a time, when we are any­way strug­gling with the im­pact of Covid-19 and so much else, that the world needs to start com­ing to­gether. It is tough enough to be lead­ing a nor­mal life amid all these ex­ter­nal forces. We don’t need to cre­ate ar­ti­fi­cial di­vi­sions,” she told The Sun­day Times.</p>
    <p>The ILP page was launched on Oct 28. It cel­e­brates unions that tran­scend man-made di­vi­sions with a daily post of love and hope that soothes frayed in­ter-com­mu­nity re­la­tion­ships in an in­creas­ingly po­larised In­dia.</p>
    <p>The idea of such an ini­tia­tive had been bub­bling away in the minds of its founders for a while but the Tan­ishq ad con­tro­versy pre­cip­i­tated ILP’s launch, said Mr Sa­mar Halarnkar, one of the three co­founders.</p>
    <p>The con­tro­versy even saw some In­dian states gov­erned by the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) pro­pose new laws on forced re­li­gious con­ver­sions, fur­ther stok­ing the “love ji­had” con­spir­acy.</p>
    <p>Mr Halarnkar said the events had “in­creas­ingly nor­malised this love ji­had non­sense”.</p>
    <p>“We told our­selves if we don’t do it now, then when? So we lit­er­ally launched it overnight,” he told The Sun­day Times. The page is helmed by two oth­ers – his wife, Priya Ra­mani, and a friend, Niloufer Venka­tra­man.</p>
    <p>Each of the 19 posts so far of­fers hope for those seek­ing refuge</p>
    <p>away from re­li­gious po­lar­i­sa­tion.</p>
    <p>One post, by a Hindu-Mus­lim cou­ple, talks about how they were asked if their daugh­ter’s name (Kuhu, which is a term for a nightin­gale’s chirp­ing) is a Hindu or a Mus­lim one.</p>
    <p>“Well can a nightin­gale’s song/chirp­ing be (of) any re­li­gion?” they write.</p>
    <p>From adding around 50-100 fol</p>
    <p>low­ers daily in the first few days, the page had amassed more than 9,000 fol­low­ers as of yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Story sub­mis­sions have also in­creased from just one or two ev­ery day to around 10 now.</p>
    <p>Mr Halarnkar at­trib­uted t he grow­ing pop­u­lar­ity of the page to the fact that many In­di­ans are to­day in­creas­ingly meet­ing and fall­ing in love with peo­ple from out­side their com­mu­nity at work­places and else­where.</p>
    <p>There is no re­li­able es­ti­mate but gov­ern­ment data in­di­cates that less than 3 per cent of mar­riages are in­ter-faith. That this plat­form res­onates with those seek­ing to marry out­side their com­mu­nity is ap­par­ent in some of the com­ments. One reads: “You guys re­store my faith in love. I wish to</p>
    <p>marry my Mus­lim boyfriend soon one day. You guys are a to­tal mo­ti­va­tion.”</p>
    <p>But while ILP has struck a chord with many, it has also hit a raw nerve. Hate mail, even though “mi­nus­cule”, has come in from those who feel the page triv­i­alises con­cerns around “love ji­had”.</p>
    <p>“They have al­ready le­git­imised love ji­had, which is a com­pletely fake nar­ra­tive. Yet, it has been weaponised and nor­malised by ev­ery­one from rightwing groups to po­lit­i­cal par­ties and oth­ers,” said Mr Halarnkar.</p>
    <p>For the mo­ment though, these voices have been drowned out by mes­sages of en­cour­age­ment.</p>
    <p>The idea, said Mr Halarnkar, is to even­tu­ally cre­ate an on­line as well as an off­line com­mu­nity that can of­fer sup­port to those who wish to marry out­side their faith or face other bar­ri­ers. This could com­prise coun­sel­lors and also lawyers to help cou­ples ne­go­ti­ate le­gal chal­lenges in­volved in reg­is­ter­ing in­ter-faith unions.</p>
    <p>But can the ILP dis­lodge en­trenched bi­ases or does it just preach to the choir? Mr Halarnkar ar­gued that even do­ing the lat­ter is im­por­tant. “We are liv­ing in such a di­vi­sive time that it has be­come im­por­tant to re­in­force and re­mind all of us that this (mar­riages that tran­scend faith and other bar­ri­ers) is also an In­dian re­al­ity,” he said.</p>
