    <p>MORE DE­TAILS LATER</p>
    <p>Singapore and Malaysia are still in dis­cus­sions over the twice-de­layed high-speed rail (HSR) project, which has un­til Dec 31 be­fore of­fi­cials have to make a fi­nal de­ci­sion on its sta­tus, a Singapore Min­istry of Trans­port spokesman has said.</p>
    <p>The min­istry was re­spond­ing to a Malaysian news re­port on Sun­day, quot­ing an un­named source, that said Malaysia is plan­ning to con­tinue the project with­out Singapore’s in­volve­ment and end the line – which starts in Kuala Lumpur – in Jo­hor, not Jurong East.</p>
    <p>Asked for its com­ment, a Singapore Min­istry of Trans­port spokesman on Sun­day said both coun­tries are still in talks.</p>
    <p>“Singapore and Malaysia are in dis­cus­sions on the Kuala LumpurSin­ga­pore High-Speed Rail (HSR) project. As com­mu­ni­cated in the Dec 2 joint state­ment by both prime min­is­ters, we will an­nounce fur­ther de­tails on the HSR project in due course,” the spokesman said.</p>
    <p>The re­port in The Malaysian In­sight (TMI) news site quoted the source as say­ing that the Malaysian gov­ern­ment will pay Singapore just un­der $105 mil­lion as com­pen­sa­tion if it opts to pro­ceed with the project on its own.</p>
    <p>“Malaysia will need to com­pen­sate Singapore with a pay­ment of $104.67 mil­lion. It must be paid by Dec 31,” the source said.</p>
    <p>Malaysia’s Min­istry of Trans­port de­clined com­ment when con­tacted. The TMI re­port said the Malaysian Cab­i­net de­cided last Fri­day that Malaysia will not con­tinue work­ing with Singapore on the project.</p>
    <p>If Malaysia were to com­plete the HSR project on its own, it would cost around RM65 bil­lion (S$21.4 bil­lion), ex­clud­ing the trains, the source told TMI.</p>
    <p>The orig­i­nal 350km rail project was to run from a ter­mi­nal sta­tion in Ban­dar Malaysia in down­town Kuala Lumpur, cross the Strait of Jo­hor near the Sec­ond Link, and stop at a ter­mi­nal in Jurong East. The HSR was slated to have five other sta­tions in be­tween.</p>
    <p>The HSR project was an­nounced in 2010, and was touted as be­ing able to cut travel time be­tween Kuala Lumpur and Singapore to 90 min­utes, com­pared with more than four hours by car.</p>
    <p>Both coun­tries signed the bi­lat­eral agree­ment, a le­gally bind­ing in­ter­na­tional pact, in Putrajaya in De­cem­ber 2016, wit­nessed by Prime Min­is­ter Lee Hsien Loong and then Malaysian Prime Min­is­ter Na­jib Razak.</p>
    <p>On Dec 2 this year, PM Lee and Prime Min­is­ter Muhyid­din Yassin held talks on the project via video­con­fer­ence, but no fur­ther in­for­ma­tion was given.</p>
    <p>The project was sus­pended af­ter a change in the Malaysian gov­ern­ment fol­low­ing the May 2018 gen­eral elec­tion.</p>
    <p>The first ex­ten­sion in Septem­ber 2018 ended in May this year, but the sus­pen­sion was ex­tended for a sec­ond and fi­nal time, till Dec 31.</p>
    <p>Singapore and Malaysia are in dis­cus­sions on the Kuala Lumpur – Singapore High-Speed Rail (HSR) project. As com­mu­ni­cated in the Dec 2 joint state­ment by both prime min­is­ters, we will an­nounce fur­ther de­tails on the HSR project in due course.</p>
