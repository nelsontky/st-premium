    <p>A United States l ed by former vice-pres­i­dent Joe Bi­den would be more pre­dictable and smoother for China to deal with, Chi­nese ex­perts have said, even though they ex­pect a Bi­den ad­min­is­tra­tion to con­tinue tak­ing a tough line on Bei­jing.</p>
    <p>They point out that com­pared with Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump, Mr Bi­den would likely be more ra­tio­nal and re­turn to high-level di­a­logue with China.</p>
    <p>Mr Bi­den had ac­cepted the Demo­cratic Party’s nom­i­na­tion to run for pres­i­dent last Thurs­day, set­ting the stage for a Novem­ber face-off with Mr Trump.</p>
    <p>With polling data show­ing Mr Bi­den in the lead against the Pres­i­dent, Chi­nese ob­servers are closely watch­ing the US pres­i­den­tial race for clues on how a Bi­den pres­i­dency would af­fect bi­lat­eral re­la­tions be­tween the two su­per­pow­ers.</p>
    <p>Un­der the cur­rent Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion, re­la­tions be­tween the two coun­tries have soured over the past few months over is­sues in­clud­ing tech­nol­ogy, trade, es­pi­onage and the han­dling of the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Se­nior US ad­min­is­tra­tion of­fi­cials have painted the con­fronta­tion with China as ide­o­log­i­cal in na­ture, spark­ing talk that this could be the beginning of a new Cold War, be­tween Bei­jing and Wash­ing­ton.</p>
    <p>But a Bi­den pres­i­dency could pre­vent ties from de­te­ri­o­rat­ing fur­ther and see a re­turn to en­gage­ment be­tween both sides, said Dr Wang Huiyao, pres­i­dent of the Bei­jing-based think-tank Cen­tre for China and Glob­al­i­sa­tion.</p>
    <p>“In­stead of hav­ing only one chan­nel (of en­gage­ment) with the US on the trade di­a­logue with the cur­rent Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion, we might see three or four chan­nels through which China could en­gage with the US,” he said, point­ing to ar­eas of po­ten­tial co­op­er­a­tion such as cli­mate change and fight­ing Covid-19.</p>
    <p>His views that a Bi­den pres­i­dency could hail a re­turn to more ra­tio­nal en­gage­ment have also been echoed by Chi­nese me­dia.</p>
    <p>The na­tion­al­ist tabloid Global Times ran an ar­ti­cle last Thurs­day cit­ing ex­perts who said it would be “smoother” for China to deal with the US with Mr Bi­den as pres­i­dent.</p>
    <p>“The Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion’s uni­lat­eral, self­ish and hege­monic stances have left di­plo­mats from the two coun­tries al­most noth­ing to talk about when they meet. Bi­den could at least change this awk­ward at­mos­phere,” said Chi­nese Academy of So­cial Sci­ences re­search fel­low Lu Xiang.</p>
    <p>Pro­fes­sor Li Haidong from the China For­eign Af­fairs Univer­sity told t he news­pa­per: “Be­cause Bi­den was vice-pres­i­dent dur­ing Obama’s term, and had a lot of prior ex­pe­ri­ence deal­ing with Chi­nese lead­ers, China would ex­pect to fa­cil­i­tate more ef­fec­tive com­mu­ni­ca­tion with him if he wins.”</p>
    <p>In Wash­ing­ton, there is bi­par­ti­san con­sen­sus that the US should take a tougher stance against China.</p>
    <p>Mr Jeffrey Bader, a former spe­cial as­sis­tant for na­tional se­cu­rity to pres­i­dent Barack Obama and a top Asia ad­viser, said at an on­line talk last Thurs­day that USChina re­la­tions would not re­turn to how they were in 2016 even if Mr Bi­den were to be elected, point­ing out that “too much has changed in Chi­nese con­duct and in US at­ti­tudes”.</p>
    <p>A Bi­den ad­min­is­tra­tion would find it dif­fi­cult to undo mea­sures on China that Mr Trump has put in place. “Po­lit­i­cally, it would be very, very dif­fi­cult. Any steps to undo any of them will come un­der se­vere at­tack, and so (Bi­den) is go­ing to have to pick his shots,” said Mr Bader.</p>
