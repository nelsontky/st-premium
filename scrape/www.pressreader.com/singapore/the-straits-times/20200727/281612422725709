    <p>The fourth-gen­er­a­tion lead­er­ship team is in “com­plete unity” be­hind Deputy Prime Min­is­ter Heng Swee Keat’s lead­er­ship, said For­eign Min­is­ter Vi­vian Balakr­ish­nan yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Say­ing he was speak­ing on be­half of the fourth-gen­er­a­tion lead­er­ship team, Dr Balakr­ish­nan said: “We are – all of us – in com­plete unity be­hind the lead­er­ship of Deputy Prime Min­is­ter Heng Swee Keat, so there’s no need for any dis­cus­sions or ques­tions on that. We are in ab­so­lute unity under his lead­er­ship.”</p>
    <p>DPM Heng, who was cho­sen by his peers to be their leader – in an an­nounce­ment first made in Novem­ber 2018 – is ex­pected to take over when Prime Min­is­ter Lee Hsien Loong steps down.</p>
    <p>Asked about the new Cabi­net line-up an­nounced by the Prime Min­is­ter on Satur­day, Dr Balakr­ish­nan re­it­er­ated PM Lee’s points that the reshuf­fle “re­flects the need for con­ti­nu­ity, the need for ro­ta­tion, and the need for re­newal”.</p>
    <p>“And if you look care­fully at the com­po­si­tion and in fact at the moves that the Prime Min­is­ter has made, it re­flects all th­ese three pri­or­i­ties,” he added.</p>
    <p>Dr Balakr­ish­nan’s re­marks came in the wake of com­ments about the Peo­ple’s Ac­tion Party’s suc­ces­sion plan at a press con­fer­ence on Satur­day dur­ing which PM Lee an­nounced his new Cabi­net lineup. Some ob­servers had ear­lier cast a ques­tion mark over the plan, cit­ing the vote share Mr Heng’s slate in East Coast GRC got in the elec­tion and the dis­rup­tion posed by Covid-19.</p>
    <p>Re­spond­ing to a ques­tion on whether the 4G lead­ers had dis­cussed or re­viewed their po­si­tion back­ing Mr Heng as their leader, Trade and In­dus­try Min­is­ter Chan Chun Sing, Mr Heng’s deputy on the 4G team, said on Satur­day that they had not dis­cussed this –</p>
    <p>TO­TAL UNITY</p>
    <p>We are – all of us – in com­plete unity be­hind the lead­er­ship of Deputy Prime Min­is­ter Heng Swee Keat, so there’s no need for any dis­cus­sions or ques­tions on that. We are in ab­so­lute unity under his</p>
    <p>’’ lead­er­ship.</p>
    <p>FOR­EIGN MIN­IS­TER VI­VIAN BALAKR­ISH­NAN</p>
    <p>and did not plan to.</p>
    <p>“We’re en­tirely fo­cused on help­ing our coun­try over­come the eco­nomic chal­lenges and sav­ing jobs at this point in time,” he said.</p>
    <p>“We have no plans to do oth­er­wise and we have no plans, no dis­cus­sion on any change in plan.”</p>
    <p>There are fewer min­is­te­rial move­ments this time, com­pared with the reshuf­fle af­ter the 2011 Gen­eral Elec­tion.</p>
    <p>Just six of the 15 govern­ment min­istries are get­ting a new min­is­ter, while top lead­er­ship changes were made to 11 out of the 14 min­istries in the Cabi­net reshuf­fle that fol­lowed GE2011.</p>
    <p>Fourth-gen­er­a­tion lead­ers tak­ing on new port­fo­lios in­clude Mr Lawrence Wong, who will be Ed­u­ca­tion Min­is­ter; Mr Des­mond Lee, who will take Mr Wong’s place as Na­tional De­vel­op­ment Min­is­ter; and Mr Ong Ye Kung, who will re­lin­quish the Ed­u­ca­tion port­fo­lio to be­come Trans­port Min­is­ter.</p>
    <p>Mr Heng is tak­ing on an ad­di­tional ap­point­ment as Co­or­di­nat­ing Min­is­ter for Eco­nomic Poli­cies.</p>
    <p>Be­sides Dr Balakr­ish­nan, Defence Min­is­ter Ng Eng Hen is one of those who re­tained their port­fo­lio. Dr Ng said yes­ter­day that he sees his ap­point­ment as a con­ti­nu­ity to take Sin­ga­pore through the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>“This is, for Sin­ga­pore, an ex­is­ten­tial threat that is life and death, not just for in­di­vid­u­als but for our na­tion. So we will take it as a con­ti­nu­ity and we want to build a strong defence to pro­tect our fu­ture,” he said.</p>
    <p>Dr Ng was elected to Par­lia­ment in 2001 and was the Sec­ond Min­is­ter for Defence from 2005 be­fore he was ap­pointed Defence Min­is­ter in 2011. “I’m fa­mil­iar with the chal­lenges and I thank the Prime Min­is­ter and other Cabi­net col­leagues for the con­fi­dence. We must do the best we can, whether it’s the min­is­ters, the of­fi­cials or the rank-and­file sol­diers,” he added.</p>
    <p>A few oth­ers wrote about their change of re­spon­si­bil­i­ties on Face­book. Mr Wong, who moves from the Na­tional De­vel­op­ment Min­istry to Ed­u­ca­tion, re­counted how en­sur­ing more af­ford­able and ac­ces­si­ble hous­ing was a ma­jor pri­or­ity five years ago. Since then, he said, the Govern­ment has, among other things, built more flats with shorter waiting times and im­proved hous­ing ac­cess to vul­ner­a­ble groups.</p>
    <p>“This work of build­ing a bet­ter Sin­ga­pore is never com­plete and takes time. You can’t see the re­sults in one elec­toral term. But over many years, and work­ing to­gether, we can build more en­dear­ing homes, and a greener and more live­able city.”</p>
    <p>Ms In­dra­nee Ra­jah, who will re­tain her post as Min­is­ter in the Prime Min­is­ter’s Of­fice and will also serve as Sec­ond Min­is­ter for Na­tional De­vel­op­ment and Fi­nance, said on Face­book yes­ter­day that it was dif­fi­cult for her to leave the Min­istry of Ed­u­ca­tion and the col­leagues she had there.</p>
    <p>She had been Sec­ond Min­is­ter for Ed­u­ca­tion since 2018. She said the min­istry’s new lead­er­ship is a “great team”.</p>
    <p>“I have ev­ery con­fi­dence that you will ac­com­plish much to­gether,” she said to her former col­leagues.</p>
