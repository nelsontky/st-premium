    <p>New Year cel­e­bra­tions that Thai­land has been bank­ing on to lift con­sumer spend­ing are hang­ing in the bal­ance, as the coun­try yes­ter­day mulled over whether to widen con­tain­ment mea­sures amid its big­gest Covid-19 out­break in months.</p>
    <p>The lat­est clus­ter, em­a­nat­ing from a shrimp mar­ket i n the seafood pro­cess­ing hub of Sa­mut Sakhon prov­ince, has af­fected more than 800 mi­grant work­ers, and the gov­ern­ment ex­pects its mass test­ing to find more in­fec­tions.</p>
    <p>Travel curbs and a 10pm to 5am cur­few are i n place in Sa­mut Sakhon, where schools and dine-in fa­cil­i­ties have been sus­pended.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, a hand­ful of new in­fec­tions linked to this clus­ter have been found in Bangkok and nearby prov­inces such as Sa­mut Prakan and Nakhon Pathom.</p>
    <p>While the Bangkok Met­ro­pol­i­tan Ad­min­is­tra­tion (BMA) has can­celled its New Year events, Prime Min­is­ter Prayut Chan-o-cha yes­ter­day did not com­mit to a larger ban, say­ing the gov­ern­ment would need to eval­u­ate the sit­u­a­tion dur­ing the week.</p>
    <p>“Let’s see what hap­pens in the next seven days, to see what we will do for the New Year,” he said. “Don’t panic.”</p>
    <p>Last Satur­day, Thai­land re­ported more than 550 new cases, its sin­gle big­gest daily in­crease. Most are asymp­to­matic Myan­mar mi­grant work­ers who form the bulk of labour­ers in its seafood in­dus­try.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, it added 382 to the tally, bring­ing its to­tal num­ber of cases to 5,289, with 60 deaths.</p>
    <p>Dr Taweesilp Visanuyoth­in, spokesman for the Cen­tre for Covid-19 Sit­u­a­tion Ad­min­is­tra­tion, said yes­ter­day: “You as busi­ness op­er­a­tors or those who are hold­ing events should con­sider num­bers we are re­port­ing to as­sess the risk.”</p>
    <p>In­vestors, how­ever, re­acted early to the bad news, caus­ing the SET Index to shed 5.4 per cent of its value yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Asean’s sec­ond-big­gest econ­omy had been look­ing to usher in the new year with ma­jor cel­e­bra­tions, de­spite re­cent new cases in north­ern Thai­land caused by peo­ple cross­ing the Thai-Myan­mar border with­out be­ing quar­an­tined.</p>
    <p>Myan­mar is still strug­gling to con­tain its out­break. It has logged more than 116,000 cases and 2,400 deaths.</p>
    <p>Thai­land’s econ­omy, mean­while, was fore­cast by the Na­tional Eco­nomic and So­cial De­vel­op­ment Coun­cil to con­tract by a smaller-than-ex­pected 6 per cent this year, de­spite the dearth of for­eign tourists.</p>
    <p>Cen­tral Group was due to hold a con­cert on New Year’s Eve in cen­tral Bangkok, fea­tur­ing pop­u­lar groups like BNK48. It is un­clear if this will go ahead.</p>
    <p>BMA spokesman Pongsakorn Kwan­muang urged all par­ties to can­cel New Year events.</p>
    <p>Dr Taweesilp has ap­pealed for pa­tience as it may take weeks to clear this out­break, with more than 10,000 peo­ple at risk to be tested.</p>
    <p>“A 100-bed field hos­pi­tal has been set up for any of them found to be in­fected, so that they can be treated with­out hav­ing to leave the area. Some of them who may not be in­fected are also con­sid­ered high risk be­cause they live to­gether at close quar­ters,” he said.</p>
    <p>“So (we would) rather have them stay to­gether in the same area than let some move out. This is the model Sin­ga­pore has used.”</p>
    <p>Mr Chairat Tri­rat­tana­jaras­porn, im­me­di­ate past pres­i­dent of the Tourism Coun­cil of Thai­land, told The Straits Times: “Some pri­vate and up-coun­try count­downs can prob­a­bly con­tinue, but not on a large scale.”</p>
