    <p>• No­vak Djokovic vir­tu­ally en­sured equalling Pete Sam­pras’ record of end­ing the year as world No. 1 for the sixth time on Wed­nes­day, when he reached the Vi­enna ATP quar­ter-fi­nals.</p>
    <p>He de­feated Croa­tia’s Borna Coric 7-6 (13-11), 6-3 and will se­cure the year-end top spot as long as Rafael Nadal does not take an un­likely wild card for the Sofia event next month.</p>
    <p>If the 33-year-old Serb wins the Vi­enna ti­tle on Sun­day, he will make sure of the land­mark re­gard­less of Nadal play­ing in Bul­garia.</p>
    <p>Djokovic, who now has 39 wins and just two de­feats this year, has been the top-ranked player at the end of a sea­son five times – in 2011, 2012, 2014, 2015 and 2018.</p>
    <p>He shares that mark with Roger Fed­erer and Nadal. Sam­pras achieved the feat six years in suc­ces­sion from 1993 to 1998.</p>
    <p>“Sam­pras was my child­hood idol grow­ing up and it will be amaz­ing to tie his record by be­ing the yearend world No. 1 six times,” Djokovic said on Sun­day.</p>
    <p>He also has an­other tar­get of beat­ing Fed­erer’s all-time best of 310 weeks spent on top of the rank­ings, cur­rently en­joy­ing his 292nd week in to­tal as world No. 1.</p>
    <p>Should he stay top, he will pass Fed­erer in early March.</p>
    <p>Djokovic, a 17-time Grand Slam ti­tle win­ner, is play­ing his first tour­na­ment since his straight-sets loss to Nadal in the Roland Gar­ros fi­nal over two weeks ago.</p>
    <p>He is seek­ing a fifth ti­tle of the year and next faces ei­ther Poland’s Hu­bert Hurkacz or Ital­ian lucky loser Lorenzo Sonego.</p>
    <p>“It was very tir­ing and very chal­leng­ing,” said Djokovic af­ter his fourth win in four meet­ings with Coric, the world No. 24.</p>
    <p>“Borna is a great fighter. He’s a very good friend of mine. Off the court, we’ve known each other for quite a long time.”</p>
    <p>Else­where, third seed Ste­fanos Tsit­si­pas opened his Vi­enna cam­paign with a 6-7 (3-7), 6-3, 6-4 win over Ger­many’s Jan-Len­nard Struff. The reign­ing ATP Fi­nals cham­pion will face Grigor Dim­itrov for a place in the last eight.</p>
    <p>Rus­sian fourth seed Daniil Medvedev also pro­gressed with a 6-3, 6-1 win over Tai­wanese lucky loser Ja­son Jung.</p>
