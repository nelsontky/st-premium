    <p>They say the night is dark­est be­fore dawn, and the track and field fra­ter­nity can only hope that a glim­mer of hope ap­pears soon for the be­lea­guered sport.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore Ath­let­ics (SA), its na­tional body, has been mired in con­tro­versy over the last five years, with is­sues such as in­fight­ing court­ing neg­a­tive head­lines.</p>
    <p>These off-field woes have af­fected its ath­letes’ per­for­mances, as seen in the 2019 SEA Games when the team failed to win a sin­gle gold medal for the first time since 1991.</p>
    <p>But change is in the air for ath­let­ics, as SA chief Tang Weng Fei on Wednes­day an­nounced he would not seek re-elec­tion at its an­nual gen­eral meet­ing on Sept 25. On the same day, Go­jek gen­eral man­ager Lien Choong Luen threw his hat into the ring and said he would run for the top job, along with his slate of nine called Team Ground Up.</p>
    <p>While he is the only can­di­date to for­mally an­nounce his bid, the Sun­day Times un­der­stands there will be a con­test at the elec­tions, with Lien’s team com­ing up against an­other slate com­pris­ing some of the in­cum­bent of­fice-bear­ers.</p>
    <p>WHAT’S WRONG</p>
    <p>The team that earn the nod from the SA’s 23 af­fil­i­ates will have the un­en­vi­able task of fix­ing is­sues that have plagued the sport for decades.</p>
    <p>Fric­tion be­tween clubs was the root of many squab­bles in the 1980s and 1990s. The as­so­ci­a­tion also found it­self in le­gal bat­tles, with the most high-pro­file case be­ing its clash with top sprinter Haron Mundir in 1989.</p>
    <p>In re­cent years, the sport has seen le­gal let­ters be­ing sent, leaked What­sApp chats ap­pear­ing to show plots against coaches and high-pro­file dis­putes be­tween ath­letes.</p>
    <p>In March, of­fice-bear­ers Poh Seng Song and Gary Yeo re­signed over dis­agree­ments with the rest of the man­age­ment com­mit­tee (MC).</p>
    <p>In­ter­nal dis­putes, court pro­ceed­ings and poor ath­lete per­for­mance were some of the is­sues that had left Tang, who has served three stints as chief, “frus­trated”.</p>
    <p>The 66-year-old had pre­vi­ously also cited dis­agree­ments and a lack of a co­he­sive team as rea­sons for step­ping down af­ter his se­cond stint from 2010 to 2016 be­fore re­turn­ing in 2018.</p>
    <p>HOW IS­SUES HIT THE SPORT</p>
    <p>Aside from push­ing its lead­ers to the exit, the in­fight­ing within the SA has also seen the abrupt res­ig­na­tion of its na­tional coaches. Mixed re­lay coach Mar­garet Oh, who worked with top sprinter Shanti Pereira, re­signed dur­ing the 2019 SEA Games in Clark, be­fore fel­low coaches Hamkah Afik and Melvin Tan fol­lowed suit weeks later.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to some coaches ST spoke to, even bud­ding ath­letes are put off from the sport be­cause of its pub­lic spats.</p>
    <p>This is­sue is also a worry for Ray­mond Tan, the fa­ther of 20-yearold na­tional sprinter El­iz­a­bethAnn.</p>
    <p>“There’s al­ways the con­cern be­cause if the en­vi­ron­ment is toxic, then it will af­fect not just her, but ev­ery ath­lete and ev­ery child (in the sport),” said the 50-year-old, who said he and his wife have never dis­cour­aged her from train­ing and com­pet­ing.</p>
    <p>“The im­por­tant thing is how to shield them from all these things and steer them to­wards their train­ing and what they can con­trol.”</p>
    <p>Al­ready, ath­let­ics has suf­fered from an alarm­ing rate of at­tri­tion of its ath­letes, with many drop­ping out of high-level com­pe­ti­tion be­fore they reach their phys­i­cal peak in the mid-to-late 20s.</p>
    <p>Those who have called time on their ca­reers pre­ma­turely in­clude hur­dler Jan­nah Wong, who set the na­tional 100m hur­dles mark in 2014 as an 18-year-old, and thrower Wan Lay Chi, who fre­quently won medals at the Asian and Asean ju­nior lev­els.</p>
    <p>CALL­ING FOR CHANGE</p>
    <p>Former na­tional sprinter Yeo, who is on Team Ground Up’s slate, told ST he felt the law­suits were “dis­trac­tions”, vow­ing that his team would pri­ori­tise an ath­lete­cen­tric en­vi­ron­ment.</p>
    <p>“Our goal is to al­low the ath­letes to train with­out pres­sure or wor­ries,” said the 33-year-old, who has won five SEA Games sil­ver medals.</p>
    <p>“We want to em­power ath­letes and coaches to take con­trol of what they stand for, what they want to do, their aims and goals, and how to get there.”</p>
    <p>NOT ALL NEG­A­TIVE</p>
    <p>SA vice-pres­i­dent (train­ing and se­lec­tion) Ang Peng Siong be­lieves the cur­rent team have made progress, point­ing to the pro­cure­ment of fund­ing from na­tional sports agency Sport Sin­ga­pore (SportSG) for its multi-year sports plan (MYSP), up un­til 2024.</p>
    <p>This is a far cry from the sit­u­a­tion in mid-2016, when SportSG with­held fund­ing for the as­so­ci­a­tion be­cause it had not sub­mit­ted re­quired plans and doc­u­ments.</p>
    <p>The as­so­ci­a­tion has been able to beef up its sec­re­tar­iat over the last two years, and has had reg­u­lar di­a­logue with ath­letes, coaches and par­ents, said Ang.</p>
    <p>The swim­ming great also noted that aquat­ics and ath­let­ics share sim­i­lar­i­ties as they are multi-dis­ci­pline sports with mul­ti­ple events, but added that swim­ming’s suc­cess in re­cent years is down to good lead­er­ship within its man­age­ment.</p>
    <p>Not­ing that there were “di­vi­sions” in the swim­ming ecosys­tem when he was an ath­lete in the 1980s and 1990s, the 57-year-old said that time is key to see­ing re­sults, just as Sin­ga­pore swim­ming re­quired a “three-Olympic cy­cle” of 12 years be­fore sweep­ing im­prove­ments were made.</p>
    <p>“We (in SA) only had two years to get things mov­ing,” said Ang. “A lot of pos­i­tive things have been done, but it’s not al­ways broad­cast... If any­thing, I be­lieve (Tang) has kept SA in good stead as he steps down.”</p>
    <p>WHAT NEXT?</p>
    <p>The decades-long fric­tion within the fra­ter­nity sug­gests that the in­com­ing team will have a gar­gan­tuan task ahead.</p>
    <p>Lien told ST that he be­lieved is­sues such as con­flicts of in­ter­est, ex­ces­sive loy­alty and ego­tism are what of­ten hin­der the progress of na­tional sports as­so­ci­a­tions like SA.</p>
    <p>“Which is why (if) we come in, my ob­jec­tive is to have the com­mit­tee never ever ap­pear in the papers,” said the 43-year-old.</p>
    <p>“Ath­letes, coaches, the as­so­ci­a­tion in terms of sports busi­ness, yes. But not mem­bers of the com­mit­tee for any other rea­son.”</p>
    <p>Of the sport’s fre­quent dis­putes, Wings Ath­let­ics Club pres­i­dent Jezreel Mok said: “Ath­let­ics is a very in­di­vid­u­al­is­tic sport, and it’s very com­pet­i­tive too... so it could just be the na­ture of it.”</p>
    <p>When asked how the frac­tious ties in the sport could be mended, one lo­cal coach with over 10 years’ ex­pe­ri­ence, who de­clined to be named, said the is­sues run so deep that the new SA lead­er­ship should fo­cus on im­ple­ment­ing its MYSP in­stead.</p>
    <p>“If you can unify just half of all the stake­hold­ers within track and field, that’s al­ready a very good thing, be­cause ev­ery group has their own KPIs and views on how to do things,” said the coach.</p>
    <p>“What should be most im­por­tant is the de­vel­op­ment struc­ture and pro­duc­ing re­sults at the in­ter­na­tional level. Once that hap­pens, you get good pub­lic­ity, fund­ing im­proves, and peo­ple start talk­ing about the sport in a good light again.”</p>
    <p>De­spite the gloom in lo­cal track and field, some youth ath­letes have given the fra­ter­nity rea­sons to cheer.</p>
    <p>In March last year, 400m hur­dler Marc Brian Louis, 16, won Sin­ga­pore’s first Asian Youth ti­tle while Reuben Rainer Lee, 15, won gold in the 200m at the South-east Asian youth meet in the same month, smash­ing the na­tional Un­der-18 record that had stood since 2001.</p>
    <p>If ath­letes like Marc and Reuben are able to ful­fil their po­ten­tial with the sup­port of the fra­ter­nity and as­so­ci­a­tion, per­haps then ath­let­ics will fi­nally have its day.</p>
    <p>STRONGER FOOT­ING</p>
    <p>A lot of pos­i­tive things have been done, but it’s not al­ways broad­cast... If any­thing, I be­lieve (Tang Weng Fei) has kept SA in good stead as he steps down. ’’</p>
    <p>ANG PENG SIONG, SA vice-pres­i­dent. TAK­ING CON­TROL</p>
    <p>Our goal is to al­low the ath­letes to train with­out pres­sure or wor­ries. We want to em­power ath­letes and coaches to take con­trol of what they stand for, what they want to do, their aims and goals, and how to get there.</p>
