    <p>•</p>
    <p>YERVAN/BAKU Nato al­lies France and Turkey traded an­gry re­crim­i­na­tions yes­ter­day as in­ter­na­tional ten­sions mounted over the fiercest clashes be­tween Azer­bai­jan and eth­nic Ar­me­nian forces since the mid-1990s.</p>
    <p>On the fourth day of fight­ing, Azer­bai­jan and the eth­nic Ar­me­nian en­clave of Nagorno-Karabakh ac­cused each other of shelling along the line of con­tact that di­vides them. Dozens have been re­ported killed and hun­dreds wounded in fight­ing since Sun­day that has spread far be­yond the en­clave’s bor­ders, threat­en­ing to spill over into an all-out war be­tween the for­mer Soviet re­publics of Azer­bai­jan and Ar­me­nia.</p>
    <p>The skir­mishes have raised con­cerns about sta­bil­ity in the South Cau­ca­sus re­gion, a cor­ri­dor for pipe­lines car­ry­ing oil and gas to world mar­kets, and raised fears that re­gional pow­ers Rus­sia and Turkey could be drawn in.</p>
    <p>Some of Turkey’s Nato al­lies are in­creas­ingly alarmed by Ankara’s stance on Nagorno-Karabakh, a break­away re­gion in­side Turkey’s close ally Azer­bai­jan that is run by eth­nic Ar­me­ni­ans but is not recog­nised by any coun­try as an in­de­pen­dent repub­lic.</p>
    <p>Echo­ing re­marks by Pres­i­dent Re­cep Tayyip Er­do­gan, For­eign Min­is­ter Mev­lut Cavu­soglu yes­ter­day said Turkey would “do what is nec­es­sary”, when asked whether Ankara would of­fer mil­i­tary sup­port if Azer­bai­jan re­quested it.</p>
    <p>Mr Cavu­soglu also said French sol­i­dar­ity with Ar­me­nia amounted to sup­port­ing Ar­me­nian oc­cu­pa­tion in Azer­bai­jan.</p>
    <p>French Pres­i­dent Em­manuel Macron, whose coun­try is home to many peo­ple of Ar­me­nian an­ces­try, hit back dur­ing a visit to Latvia. He said France was ex­tremely con­cerned by “war­like mes­sages” from Turkey “which es­sen­tially re­move any of Azer­bai­jan’s in­hi­bi­tions in re­con­quer­ing Nagorno-Karabakh”. “And that we won’t ac­cept,” he said.</p>
    <p>Nagorno-Karabakh, a moun­tain­ous en­clave, broke away from Azer­bai­jan in the 1990s in a war that killed an es­ti­mated 30,000 peo­ple and dis­placed hun­dreds of thou­sands.</p>
    <p>In yes­ter­day’s clashes, the lat­est in decades of con­flict, Ar­me­nian me­dia said three civil­ians were killed and sev­eral wounded by shelling in the town of Mar­tak­ert in Nagorno-Karabakh.</p>
    <p>Azer­bai­jan said 14 Az­eri civil­ians had been killed since fight­ing be­gan on Sun­day, and re­leased footage show­ing grey smoke ris­ing from in­side Nagorno-Karabakh as it was pounded by Az­eri ar­tillery.</p>
    <p>Pho­to­graphs taken in the Az­eri town of Terter showed peo­ple tak­ing cover in dugouts, and dam­aged build­ings that res­i­dents said had been hit by Ar­me­nian shells.</p>
    <p>Azer­bai­jan said eth­nic Ar­me­nian forces tried to re­cover lost ground by launch­ing counter-at­tacks in the di­rec­tion of Mada­giz, but Az­eri forces re­pelled the at­tack.</p>
    <p>Ar­me­nia said the Az­eri army had been shelling the whole front line dur­ing the night and two Az­eri drones were shot down over Stepanaker­t, Nagorno-Karabakh’s ad­min­is­tra­tive cen­tre. It was not pos­si­ble to in­de­pen­dently con­firm the re­port.</p>
    <p>Ar­me­nian Prime Min­is­ter Nikol Pashinyan said he was not con­sid­er­ing ask­ing for Rus­sia’s help at this point un­der a post-Soviet se­cu­rity treaty, but did not rule out do­ing so.</p>
    <p>He said he and Rus­sian Pres­i­dent Vladimir Putin had not dis­cussed the pos­si­bil­ity of Rus­sian mil­i­tary in­terven­tion when they spoke by tele­phone on Tues­day.</p>
    <p>Ar­me­nia’s uni­fied in­for­ma­tion cen­tre, an on­line gov­ern­men­tal plat­form, posted pic­tures of the wreck­age of what it said was an SU-25 war­plane shot down by a Turk­ish fighter jet on Tues­day.</p>
    <p>Turkey de­nied down­ing the plane. A se­nior Az­eri of­fi­cial ac­cused Ar­me­nia of ly­ing, and said two Ar­me­nian SU-25s had crashed into a moun­tain.</p>
