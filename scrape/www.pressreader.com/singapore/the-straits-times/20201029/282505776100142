    <p>Based on for­mer FBI chief James Comey’s mem­oir, mini-se­ries The Comey Rule tack­les con­tro­ver­sial Amer­i­can pol­i­tics</p>
    <p>As the Amer­i­can pres­i­den­tial elec­tion ap­proaches on Nov 3, the mini-se­ries The Comey Rule ex­plores one of the most con­tro­ver­sial is­sues of the last elec­tion and its af­ter­math: the role of for­mer Fed­eral Bureau of In­ves­ti­ga­tion (FBI) chief James Comey and his deal­ings with United States Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump.</p>
    <p>Ac­tor Jeff Daniels, who plays Mr Comey in the two-part drama – avail­able now on Fox+, and on FX from to­mor­row to Nov 4 at 11pm nightly – says he be­lieves Mr Comey’s much-crit­i­cised ac­tions lead­ing up to the 2016 vote were jus­ti­fied.</p>
    <p>The 65-year-old Emmy-win­ning ac­tor re­veals that the for­mer FBI chief has watched the se­ries – and told Daniels its re-en­act­ment of his in­fa­mous 2017 din­ner with Mr Trump brought back so many mem­o­ries that he be­came emo­tional and “a bit nau­seous”.</p>
    <p>The drama is based on Mr Comey’s best-sell­ing 2018 mem­oir, A Higher Loy­alty – a be­hind-thescenes look at the 2016 pres­i­den­tial race and the events that fol­lowed.</p>
    <p>This in­cludes Mr Comey’s de­ci­sion to re­lease a re­port on the FBI in­ves­ti­ga­tion into pres­i­den­tial can­di­date Hil­lary Clin­ton’s e-mails, which many be­lieve swayed the elec­tion against her; as well as the claim that Pres­i­dent Trump tried to pres­sure Mr Comey over sub­se­quent in­ves­ti­ga­tions into whether Rus­sia had in­flu­enced him or the elec­tion.</p>
    <p>Speak­ing to re­porters in Los An­ge­les by video call ear­lier this year, Daniels – who won Em­mys for tele­vi­sion dra­mas The News­room (2012 to 2014) and God­less (2017) – says that, like many Amer­i­cans, he had been left reel­ing by the tur­bu­lent, scan­dal-rid­den race for the White House in 2016.</p>
    <p>And when Mr Comey “re­opened the in­ves­ti­ga­tion into Hil­lary’s emails a month be­fore the elec­tion”, Daniels had won­dered: “What is he think­ing? What is he do­ing? Be­cause it looks on the sur­face like he’s tak­ing a run at Hil­lary, and you just don’t un­der­stand it.”</p>
    <p>But now, four years later, af­ter film­ing The Comey Rule, the ac­tor says he has “learnt what (Comey) was think­ing and why he did what he did. And that maybe the rush to (pass) judg­ment on him as be­ing self-right­eous and out for per­sonal gain was pre­ma­ture or wrong”.</p>
    <p>Daniels be­lieves Mr Comey’s own de­fence of his ac­tions on the</p>
    <p>Clin­ton e-mails, namely that he was driven by a de­sire to up­hold the let­ter of the law.</p>
    <p>“I found that he did things from an apo­lit­i­cal po­si­tion which, in a po­lit­i­cally di­vided Amer­ica, is like a for­eign con­cept,” says the Dumb And Dum­ber (1994) ac­tor.</p>
    <p>“He never viewed things po­lit­i­cally – he viewed them (in terms of) the rule of law, what was right, jus­tice and in­tegrity.”</p>
    <p>The for­mer FBI chief, he adds, was com­mit­ted to be­ing apo­lit­i­cal. “And we now un­der­stand that if we don’t have apo­lit­i­cal peo­ple serv­ing in our gov­ern­ment, then we won’t have a democ­racy.”</p>
    <p>De­spite be­ing about a sit­ting Amer­i­can pres­i­dent, Daniels says the show – which co-stars Bren­dan Glee­son (Into The Storm, 2009) as Mr Trump and Holly Hunter (The Pi­ano, 1993) as for­mer act­ing at­tor­ney-gen­eral Sally Yates – did not cen­sor it­self.</p>
    <p>“Like with any­thing that comes out, you get sug­ges­tions from the pub­lic­ity depart­ment and the stu­dio, and talk­ing points, but there were no lim­its.”</p>
    <p>The ac­tor, who has been highly crit­i­cal of the Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion, ad­dresses the way Pres­i­dent Trump ap­pears to have “got away with every­thing” dur­ing his pres­i­dency.</p>
    <p>“We’re go­ing to find out whether he gets away with every­thing on Nov 3 when we have the elec­tion,” Daniels says.</p>
    <p>He adds: “I’ve al­ways felt that Trump was hid­ing some­thing and that he still is. And that Jim Comey was one of the peo­ple tasked with find­ing out what that was or is, and that’s one of the rea­sons he was fired – be­cause he wouldn’t pledge loy­alty to Trump so the in­ves­ti­ga­tions would be stopped.”</p>
    <p>As an ac­tor, Daniels has found him­self fre­quently tack­ling con­tem­po­rary Amer­i­can pol­i­tics.</p>
    <p>While some of that has been co­in­ci­den­tal, he says it stems partly from his role as a news an­chor in The News­room.</p>
    <p>Be­ing able to rat­tle off the show’s po­lit­i­cally dense di­a­logue has turned into a spe­cial­ity of sorts, he says.</p>
    <p>“To be able to han­dle (The News­room cre­ator) Aaron Sorkin’s di­a­logue is a lot of work and it’s not easy. But ap­par­ently I make it look easy, so I get more of that. That’s kind of how Hol­ly­wood works – they want you to do what you did be­fore, but do it for them.”</p>
    <p>I found that he did things from an apo­lit­i­cal po­si­tion which, in a po­lit­i­cally di­vided Amer­ica, is like a for­eign con­cept... We now un­der­stand that if we don’t have apo­lit­i­cal peo­ple serv­ing in our gov­ern­ment, then we won’t have a democ­racy.</p>
    <p>The Comey Rule is avail­able now on Fox+, and on FX (Sing­tel TV Chan­nel 310, StarHub TV Chan­nel 507) from Oct 30 to Nov 4 at 11pm nightly.</p>
