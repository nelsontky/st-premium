    <p>LON­DON • Ne­go­ti­a­tions be­tween Bri­tain and the Euro­pean Union over a post-Brexit trade deal are head­ing into a cri­sis week­end as both sides try to sal­vage an ac­cord.</p>
    <p>If no agree­ment is reached, it would be a ham­mer blow for busi­nesses and con­sumers on both sides.</p>
    <p>Decades of free move­ment of goods, ser­vices, peo­ple and cap­i­tal would come to an abrupt end when Bri­tain leaves the EU’s sin­gle mar­ket and Cus­toms union on Dec 31.</p>
    <p>Com­pa­nies would face tar­iffs, quo­tas and po­ten­tial chaos as they move goods across the bor­der; fi­nance firms in the City of Lon­don would lose their pass­ports to of­fer ser­vices across the EU; and con­sumers would see their rights to live on the other side of the English Chan­nel cur­tailed.</p>
    <p>Here are some of the is­sues of­fi­cials will be look­ing closely at.</p>
    <p>THE ECO­NOMIC HIT</p>
    <p>With­out a trade deal, the Bri­tish econ­omy would suf­fer a neart­erm shock of about 1.5 per cent of gross do­mes­tic prod­uct (GDP), ac­cord­ing to Bloomberg Eco­nom­ics.</p>
    <p>The Of­fice for Bud­get Re­spon­si­bil­ity, Bri­tain’s in­de­pen­dent spend­ing watch­dog, fore­casts a 2 per cent GDP de­cline.</p>
    <p>TAR­IFFS</p>
    <p>In­stead of fric­tion­less trade with a mar­ket of more than 400 mil­lion con­sumers, Bri­tish firms would re­vert to trad­ing with the EU un­der World Trade Or­gan­i­sa­tion (WTO) rules in 1995.</p>
    <p>That means im­ports and ex­ports to the EU would be sub­ject to WTO-ne­go­ti­ated tar­iffs – es­sen­tially a tax on goods.</p>
    <p>The EU’s av­er­age tar­iff rate is 3 per cent, but some prod­ucts would at­tract higher levies: Bri­tish car­mak­ers would face a 10 per cent tar­iff on all auto ex­ports to the EU, while farm­ers ex­port­ing dairy prod­ucts would see a 35.4 per cent charge.</p>
    <p>Tar­iffs could also lead to in­creased prices for com­pa­nies and con­sumers.</p>
    <p>Some 85 per cent of food prod­ucts im­ported from the EU would at­tract tar­iffs of 5 per cent or more.</p>
    <p>About 43 per cent of Bri­tain’s ex­ports, val­ued at about £300 bil­lion (S$538 bil­lion), go to the EU each year, and the bloc is the source of 51 per cent of its im­ports.</p>
    <p>CITY OF LON­DON</p>
    <p>Fi­nance firms will lose their pass­ports to of­fer ser­vices across the EU, whether there is a trade deal or not, forc­ing them to shift staff and beef up their op­er­a­tions in the bloc.</p>
    <p>Their ac­cess to cus­tomers would de­pend on the EU judg­ing Bri­tish rules to be equiv­a­lent to its own in 40 ar­eas. Fail­ure to reach a trade ac­cord would set back that process.</p>
    <p>CUS­TOMS</p>
    <p>Busi­nesses ex­port­ing to the EU will have to file Cus­toms declaratio­ns with or with­out a trade deal.</p>
    <p>To move goods from Dover to Calais – Bri­tain’s busiest cross­ing point with the EU – trucks will need a gov­ern­ment-is­sued per­mit in­di­cat­ing they have the cor­rect pa­per­work and will not be held up by French of­fi­cials. Bor­der de­lays would threaten to throw man­u­fac­tur­ers re­ly­ing on parts ar­riv­ing just-in-time into chaos, in­clud­ing com­pa­nies in car-mak­ing and aerospace, while fresh food pro­duce might rot as trucks line up to clear Cus­toms.</p>
