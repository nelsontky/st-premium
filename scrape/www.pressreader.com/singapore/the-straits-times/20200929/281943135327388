    <p>Char­i­ties were forced to boost their on­line pres­ence so that they could keep of­fer­ing ser­vices amid the pan­demic, but many or­gan­i­sa­tions are find­ing that go­ing dig­i­tal is reap­ing other ben­e­fits as well.</p>
    <p>Take Heart­ware Net­work, which rolled out its vir­tual Learn­ing To­gether pro­gramme dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker pe­riod to help lower pri­mary school chil­dren with lit­er­acy.</p>
    <p>The suc­cess of the ini­tia­tive has prompted it to con­tinue the ser­vice on­line, which in­volves young peo­ple vol­un­teer­ing for 20 min­utes to 30 min­utes three times a week.</p>
    <p>Heart­ware Net­work’s ex­ec­u­tive di­rec­tor Tan See Leng said the fre­quency and du­ra­tion of the pro­gramme means it is not fea­si­ble for vol­un­teers to travel for each en­gage­ment as their jour­ney time may ex­ceed the en­gage­ment pe­riod, so hold­ing vir­tual ses­sions is bet­ter.</p>
    <p>Playeum, which ad­vo­cates nur­tur­ing chil­dren through play, cre­ativ­ity and the arts, holds a course for pre-school ed­u­ca­tors.</p>
    <p>Playeum’s ex­ec­u­tive di­rec­tor Char­lotte Goh said: “Since (the course has) gone dig­i­tal, it’s been a full house ev­ery ses­sion. When we had it in per­son, we never had such over­flow­ing de­mand that we had to move peo­ple to the next ses­sion.”</p>
    <p>Go­ing on­line for Ding Yi Mu­sic Com­pany has also al­lowed it to reach dif­fer­ent parts of the world. It is now cre­at­ing a video fea­tur­ing mu­si­cians from as far away as Fin­land and Canada, said gen­eral man­ager Elvia Goh.</p>
    <p>But not ev­ery­thing works best on­line, say those in the sec­tor.</p>
    <p>The Mus­cu­lar Dys­tro­phy As­so­ci­a­tion (Sin­ga­pore) (MDAS) moved its de­sign cour­ses to a vir­tual learn­ing mode in March.</p>
    <p>While the on­line cour­ses are work­ing out well, MDAS has al­lowed some stu­dents who need more help or who are new to the lessons to at­tend the cour­ses in per</p>
    <p>son at its Bis­han cen­tre.</p>
    <p>The as­so­ci­a­tion is also look­ing for­ward to bring­ing back its phys­i­cal phys­io­ther­apy ses­sions.</p>
    <p>“Many of our mem­bers need breath­ing and other ex­er­cises. Though on­line ther­apy is not the same phys­i­cal ther­apy, it pro­vides an al­ter­na­tive,” said ex­ec­u­tive di­rec­tor Judy Wee.</p>
    <p>Sim­i­larly, Ding Yi’s Ms Goh noted that go­ing on­line does not al­ways cut it for mu­sic, which is best en­joyed live.</p>
    <p>“Our core work is to pro­vide live cham­ber mu­sic for peo­ple. It is im­por­tant for them to be there live to be moved by our mu­sic, yet we are un­able to do that now,” she added.</p>
    <p>An­other strug­gle with go­ing dig­i­tal is fund rais­ing, as many char­i­ties rely on flag days and gala din­ners to can­vass for do­na­tions.</p>
    <p>They have had to think cre­atively to find new ways to en­cour­age in­di­vid­u­als and firms to do­nate, even as the bleak eco­nomic out­look has led many peo­ple to tighten their purse strings.</p>
    <p>Ms Wee said MDAS has come up with sev­eral i deas, such as the #Rep­sForMD cam­paign this month, where the as­so­ci­a­tion is en­cour­ag­ing peo­ple to ex­er­cise for MDAS and ask their friends to sup­port by do­nat­ing.</p>
    <p>It also hopes to hold a vir­tual gala later this year in con­junc­tion with its 20th an­niver­sary cel­e­bra­tions.</p>
    <p>“It is harder (to raise funds), es­pe­cially when you’re a smaller or­gan­i­sa­tion and not many peo­ple know about you and (would not) re­mem­ber to give to or­gan­i­sa­tions like us,” said Ms Wee.</p>
    <p>She added that the as­so­ci­a­tion is thank­ful that the Tote Board and the Gov­ern­ment are match­ing some do­na­tions, such as through the En­hanced Fund-Rais­ing Pro­gramme.</p>
    <p>All Saints Home also started feel­ing the pinch when the pan­demic forced it to can­cel sev­eral planned fund-rais­ing ac­tiv­i­ties. These included a cy­cling event, a movie night and its yearly thanks­giv­ing din­ner, usu­ally a ma­jor source of funds for the year.</p>
    <p>Chief ex­ec­u­tive Sa­muel Tan said a we­bi­nar on on­line fund rais­ing or­gan­ised by the Com­mis­sioner of Char­i­ties that he at­tended in May un­der­lined that a char­ity must have a com­pelling mes­sage to touch the hearts of donors.</p>
    <p>The nurs­ing home then cre­ated a video mon­tage that shows res­i­dents with their care­givers and fam­ily mem­bers. It was launched on Na­tional Day with a short seg­ment at the end di­rect­ing donors to its Giv­ing.sg page.</p>
    <p>The video has helped cre­ate aware­ness of the home and its cause, which is to show love and com­pas­sion for the el­derly un­der its care, added Mr Tan.</p>
    <p>But he noted that with more char­i­ties go­ing on­line with cam­paigns, the fund-rais­ing space has be­come sat­u­rated. “It is a chal­lenge to think of cre­ative cam­paigns to pique the public’s in­ter­est,” he said.</p>
    <p>Donors have been af­fected by the pan­demic and the poor econ­omy so char­i­ties have to be sen­si­tive when can­vass­ing for funds, he added.</p>
    <p>Cul­ture, Com­mu­nity and Youth Min­is­ter Ed­win Tong an­nounced plans last Wed­nes­day to help char­i­ties boost their dig­i­tal ca­pa­bil­i­ties, with ini­tia­tives such as a Char­i­ties GoDig­i­tal Kit.</p>
    <p>Ms Wee said such guid­ance would be help­ful, adding: “If some­one could help to point out what ar­eas we should fo­cus our dig­i­tal ef­forts on, that would be good.</p>
    <p>“While we have started dig­i­tal­is­ing our sys­tems, we need to be pre­pared should we be faced with an­other cri­sis like the pan­demic. We need to know the op­tions avail­able.”</p>
