    <p>The coron­avirus pan­demic may be up­end­ing work­places and leav­ing many work­ers job­less, but there are still ex­cel­lent em­ploy­ers who are look­ing af­ter their staff.</p>
    <p>The sec­ond edi­tion of the sur­vey, Sin­ga­pore’s Best Em­ploy­ers, seeks to un­earth these gems.</p>
    <p>Start­ing to­day, The Straits Times is invit­ing em­ploy­ees to share their views and help iden­tify the or­gan­i­sa­tions peo­ple most en­joy work­ing for.</p>
    <p>Rank­ings will be based pri­mar­ily on whether staff would rec­om­mend the com­pany to a friend or fam­ily mem­ber.</p>
    <p>The sur­vey, which is con­ducted jointly with global re­search firm Statista, runs for six weeks from to­day till Sept 18.</p>
    <p>Par­tic­i­pants can ac­cess the sur­vey on­line at http://str.sg/oFEj</p>
    <p>The re­sults will be pub­lished next April in The Straits Times.</p>
    <p>Last year’s inau­gu­ral sur­vey saw re­tailer Uniqlo top­ping the list of 150 most at­trac­tive em­ploy­ers. Fel­low re­tailer Adi­das Sin­ga­pore came in sec­ond, fol­lowed by tech­nol­ogy gi­ants Google and Ama­zon, and oil and gas com­pany BP.</p>
    <p>More than 8,000 peo­ple took part in last year’s sur­vey, which looked at 1,800 com­pa­nies and in­sti­tu­tions.</p>
    <p>This year, more than 1,700 or­gan­i­sa­tions across all in­dus­tries will be con­sid­ered. They must have at least 200 em­ploy­ees in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>Re­spon­dents, who can par­tic­i­pate via on­line ac­cess pan­els and through The Straits Times web­site, will be asked to rate their will­ing­ness to rec­om­mend their own em­ployer on a scale of zero to 10.</p>
    <p>Zero means they will not rec­om­mend the com­pany un­der any cir­cum­stances, while 10 rep­re­sents a def­i­nite thumbs up.</p>
    <p>They will also be asked if there are other em­ploy­ers in their re­spec­tive in­dus­tries that they will – or will not – rec­om­mend.</p>
    <p>A com­pany’s score will be cal­cu­lated based on these two fac­tors, with greater weight given to the direct score given by its own staff.</p>
    <p>The sur­vey will not be ad­min­is­tered through com­pa­nies so that em­ploy­ees do not feel pres­sured to state a cer­tain view. Re­sponses will be kept anony­mous.</p>
    <p>Statista has con­ducted sim­i­lar sur­veys in other coun­tries, in­clud­ing the United States, Ger­many and Switzer­land.</p>
    <p>The sur­vey in­cludes ques­tions on how work­ers feel about as­pects of their jobs, such as whether they are proud of the prod­uct or ser­vice their com­pany of­fers, whether the com­pany pays a good salary, and whether men and women have the same op­por­tu­ni­ties for ad­vance­ment.</p>
    <p>This year, they will also be asked how well their em­ployer is man­ag­ing the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>“There is no tougher time for em­ploy­ers, who are cop­ing with Covid-19 and a re­ces­sion,” said Mr Do­minic Nathan, man­ag­ing edi­tor of the English/Malay/Tamil Me­dia Group of Sin­ga­pore Press Hold­ings.</p>
    <p>“In some sec­tors, just hold­ing on to em­ploy­ees is a daily strug­gle, so to stand out as be­ing among the best em­ploy­ers in this cli­mate will be an ex­tra­or­di­nary achieve­ment.”</p>
    <p>Statista as­so­ciate part­ner Thomas Clark noted that the pan­demic has posed un­prece­dented chal­lenges to hu­man re­source de­part­ments.</p>
    <p>Statista Re­search & Anal­y­sis di­rec­tor Silke Giesler, who over­sees the team that con­ducts em­ployee sat­is­fac­tion sur­veys glob­ally, said: “In the first year, we iden­ti­fied Sin­ga­pore’s best em­ploy­ers in nor­mal days. This time, we will be able to find out which com­pa­nies suc­ceed in keep­ing their em­ploy­ees happy in most ex­tra­or­di­nary days.”</p>
