    <p>Moderna’s vac­cine might pre­vent most peo­ple from get­ting sick with Covid-19, but it may not stop trans­mis­sion, said the firm’s chief sci­en­tist.</p>
    <p>“They (clin­i­cal trial re­sults) do not show that they pre­vent you from po­ten­tially car­ry­ing this virus tran­siently and in­fect­ing oth­ers,” said Moderna’s chief med­i­cal of­fi­cer Tal Zaks in a re­cent in­ter­view on doc­u­men­tary news web­site Ax­ios.</p>
    <p>How­ever he does “be­lieve” the vac­cine can re­duce trans­mis­sion of the virus from one per­son to an­other. It just has not been tested in its tri­als, he said.</p>
    <p>“Do I be­lieve that it re­duces trans­mis­sion? Ab­so­lutely yes, and I say this be­cause of the science,” he said.</p>
    <p>“But ab­sent proof, I think it’s im­por­tant that we don’t change be­hav­iours solely on the ba­sis of vac­ci­na­tion,” said Dr Zaks, sug­gest­ing that peo­ple con­tinue to use non-med­i­cal meth­ods like wear­ing masks and so­cial dis­tanc­ing to stem the spread of the coronaviru­s.</p>
    <p>The Amer­i­can biotech­nol­ogy com­pany had ear­lier an­nounced that its vac­cine was 94.5 per cent ef­fec­tive at pro­tect­ing peo­ple from Covid-19.</p>
    <p>Dr Zaks urged the pub­lic not to “over-in­ter­pret” the vac­cine’s promis­ing trial re­sults and as­sume life could go back to nor­mal af­ter adults are vac­ci­nated.</p>
    <p>Ear­lier this month, Dr Ugur Sahin, chief ex­ec­u­tive of Ger­many’s BioNTech, which is be­hind the vac­cine de­vel­oped with Pfizer, said he was con­fi­dent its can­di­date could pre­vent trans­mis­sion “maybe not 90 per cent but maybe 50 per cent”, re­ported Agence France-Presse.</p>
    <p>Like the Pfizer-BioNTech vac­cine, the Moderna vac­cine uses a syn­thetic ver­sion of coronaviru­s ge­netic ma­te­rial, called mes­sen­ger RNA or mRNA, to pro­gram a per­son’s cells to churn out many copies of a frag­ment of the virus. That frag­ment sets off alarms in the im­mune sys­tem and stim­u­lates it to at­tack, should the real virus try to in­vade.</p>
    <p>Al­though a num­ber of vac­cines us­ing this tech­nol­ogy are in de­vel­op­ment for other in­fec­tions and can­cers, none has yet been ap­proved or mar­keted.</p>
    <p>Bloomberg re­ported that var­i­ous pub­lic opin­ion sur­veys have found that a sig­nif­i­cant pro­por­tion of peo­ple are scep­ti­cal of vac­cines, or at least have some mis­giv­ings.</p>
    <p>But if a vac­cine does not mean­ing­fully re­duce vi­ral trans­mis­sion, it leaves the un-im­mu­nised rel­a­tively vul­ner­a­ble. And if the coronaviru­s con­tin­ues to be passed from per­son to per­son, it has a bet­ter chance to keep mu­tat­ing and po­ten­tially evade hu­man de­fences.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to Science Mag­a­zine, Pfizer and Moderna tested only trial mem­bers who de­vel­oped po­ten­tial Covid-19 symp­toms.</p>
    <p>With­out know­ing if oth­ers mem­bers of the tri­als might have been asymp­to­matic spread­ers, there was no way to say for sure whether the vac­cine pre­vented them from in­fect­ing oth­ers.</p>
    <p>“When we start the de­ploy­ment of this vac­cine, we will not have suf­fi­cient con­crete data to prove that this vac­cine re­duces trans­mis­sion,” Dr Zaks said.</p>
    <p>It is not yet pos­si­ble to find out whether vac­cines are able to pro­duce a ster­il­is­ing im­mu­nity based on cur­rent clin­i­cal tri­als as they have not been set up to pro­vide that in­for­ma­tion, said Bloomberg.</p>
    <p>Ear­lier this week, it was re­ported that the Covid-19 vac­cine de­vel­oped by Ox­ford Univer­sity and As­traZeneca shows an av­er­age 70 per cent ef­fec­tive­ness in prevent­ing those vac­ci­nated from fall­ing ill with the virus.</p>
    <p>While this is lower than the fig­ures for the Pfiz­erBioNTech and Moderna vac­cines, de­vel­op­ers of the Ox­ford-As­traZeneca vac­cine said there are early indi­ca­tions it might help stop trans­mis­sion of the dis­ease.</p>
