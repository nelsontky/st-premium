    <p>Talk-show host Ellen DeGeneres (right) said on Thurs­day that she had tested pos­i­tive for the coro­n­avirus, but was feel­ing fine.</p>
    <p>The Amer­i­can come­di­enne said on Twit­ter that all her close con­tacts had been no­ti­fied.</p>
    <p>“I want to let you all know that I tested pos­i­tive for Covid-19. For­tu­nately, I’m feel­ing fine right now,” she said in a Twit­ter post­ing.</p>
    <p>DeGeneres, 62, host of the pop­u­lar day­time show The Ellen DeGeneres Show, said she was fol­low­ing health guide­lines and would re­turn to her show af­ter the hol­i­days.</p>
    <p>A rep­re­sen­ta­tive said pro­duc­tion of the show had been halted un­til next month.</p>
    <p>DeGeneres is the lat­est celebrity to test pos­i­tive for the dis­ease. Ac­tors Tom Hanks, Idris Elba, Bryan Cranston and Hugh Grant, along with singers Kanye West, Bad Bunny and Glo­ria Este­fan, are among those who have said they were di­ag­nosed with the virus or had suf­fered symp­toms.</p>
    <p>The Ellen DeGeneres Show is filmed in the Los An­ge­les area which this week re-im­posed re­stric­tions on house­hold gath­er­ings and shut down in­door and out­door din­ing amid a surge of coro­n­avirus cases.</p>
