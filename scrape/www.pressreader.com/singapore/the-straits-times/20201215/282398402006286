    <p>• Chelsea are de­ter­mined to re­cover from last week­end’s 1-0 Premier League de­feat at Ever­ton, which ended their 17-game un­beaten run in all com­pe­ti­tions, and to­day’s trip to Wolver­hamp­ton Wan­der­ers is ex­actly the an­ti­dote they need.</p>
    <p>Speak­ing at his vir­tual pre-match press con­fer­ence yesterday, man­ager Frank Lam­pard said: “The Premier League is un­for­giv­ing. We saw that with dif­fer­ent re­sults over the week­end and we see it pretty much ev­ery week­end and match day.</p>
    <p>“We weren’t at our top level on Satur­day and we got beaten. That’s it. We dropped our level for a game. That’s ab­so­lutely on us to pick it up again straight away.”</p>
    <p>The packed Christ­mas sched­ule – there is a run of four games be­fore the end of the month – is what usu­ally sep­a­rates the pre­tenders from the con­tenders and Chelsea, who are three points be­hind lead­ers Tot­ten­ham and Liver­pool (both 25), aim to stay within touch­ing dis­tance of the teams at the top.</p>
    <p>On the im­por­tance of their next few matches, Lam­pard said: “I think I felt it is a long race to win the Premier League. I did it as a player and I un­der­stand there are lots of el­e­ments to it.</p>
    <p>“One of those is los­ing a game and try­ing to bounce back very quickly, which is what we need to do. We need to sus­tain per­for­mances and re­sults over a pe­riod of time. Par­tic­u­larly in a busy pe­riod of time like Christ­mas. So it is on us to do that.”</p>
    <p>Sep­a­rately, Manch­ester City man­ager Pep Guardi­ola was un­sure whether Ser­gio Aguero would be in­cluded when they host West Bromwich Al­bion at the Eti­had to­day, even though the Ar­gentina striker was back in train­ing.</p>
    <p>The club’s record scorer, who came off the bench to score against Mar­seille in the Cham­pi­ons League last week, was ab­sent for Satur­day’s goal­less league draw at Manch­ester United.</p>
    <p>Re­veal­ing Aguero had suf­fered from a bout of gas­troen­teri­tis, Guardi­ola, who also con­firmed Eric Gar­cia and Olek­sandr Zinchenko were both out, added: “To­day, Ser­gio was train­ing. The last two or three days be­fore that, he didn’t.”</p>
