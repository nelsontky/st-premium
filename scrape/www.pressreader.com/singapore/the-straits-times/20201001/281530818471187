    <p>Sin­ga­pore’s as­set man­age­ment in­dus­try reg­is­tered a ro­bust ex­pan­sion last year, aided by a strong pipe­line of new man­agers and funds seek­ing in­vest­ment op­por­tu­ni­ties in the re­gion. As­sets su­per­vised by Sin­ga­pore-based man­agers grew by 15.7 per cent to reach a to­tal of about $4 tril­lion by the end of last year.</p>
    <p>Ama­zon is plan­ning to take over some of Cit­i­group’s of­fice space in Sin­ga­pore, at a time when a num­ber of the US e-com­merce gi­ant’s Chi­nese tech ri­vals are ex­pand­ing here.</p>
    <p>The on­line re­tailer will lease three floors cov­er­ing about 90,000 sq ft at Asia Square Tower 1 in the heart of the fi­nan­cial dis­trict, ac­cord­ing to peo­ple with knowl­edge of the plans. Staff will move into the new of­fices early next year, the sources said, ask­ing not to be iden­ti­fied as the plans are not pub­lic.</p>
    <p>Cit­i­group, cur­rently the largest ten­ant there with nine floors, is trim­ming its of­fice space to bet­ter use its real es­tate as its 10-year lease is due to ex­pire soon, the peo­ple said.</p>
    <p>Eco­nomic De­vel­op­ment Board ex­ec­u­tive vice-pres­i­dent Kiren Ku­mar told The Straits Times that com­pa­nies world­wide and from var­i­ous in­dus­tries con­tinue to grow here to serve Asian and global mar­kets.</p>
    <p>In par­tic­u­lar, tech sec­tor com­pa­nies are build­ing ca­pabil­i­ties in ar­eas such as soft­ware engi­neer­ing and cloud ser­vices, he said. “This will al­low us to meet the grow­ing de­mand for en­ter­prise and con­sumer dig­i­tal ser­vices in Sin­ga­pore and Asia, and cre­ate mean­ing­ful jobs for Sin­ga­pore­ans in both tech and non-tech roles within the tech­nol­ogy sec­tor.”</p>
    <p>Ama­zon’s plans here come as some of China’s big­gest tech firms, such as Ten­cent and ByteDance, make the Repub­lic their beach­head for the rest of Asia. Sin­ga­pore is be­com­ing a re­gional base for both Western and Chi­nese com­pa­nies be­cause of its de­vel­oped fi­nan­cial and le­gal sys­tems. It is be­com­ing more at­trac­tive to some as Bei­jing tight­ens its grip on Hong Kong.</p>
    <p>“Ama­zon is al­ways in a state of in­no­va­tion and dis­rup­tion,” said Mr Justin Tang, the head of Asian re­search at United First Part­ners in Sin­ga­pore. “Asia is a source of growth for them and they need to be near where their ri­vals are.”</p>
    <p>Ama­zon cur­rently has about 200 job open­ings in Sin­ga­pore for roles such as sales, ac­cord­ing to its ca­reer site. It launched its Sin­ga­pore web­site, which was also its first in South­east Asia, last year. A rep­re­sen­ta­tive for Ama­zon de­clined to com­ment.</p>
    <p>A spokesman for Cit­i­group con­firmed it is giv­ing up the space, but de­clined to say who is tak­ing over. Some con­sumer bank­ing staff, and em­ploy­ees in other func­tions, will re­lo­cate to Changi Busi­ness Park</p>
    <p>where the bank has big­ger premises and a long-term lease, he said.</p>
    <p>Ama­zon, which has been rapidly ex­pand­ing in Sin­ga­pore, has ex­ist­ing of­fices in Cap­i­tal Square and One Ge­orge Street. A lease for the space in Asia Square Tower 1 would typ­i­cally be for more than five years.</p>
    <p>Cit­i­group is among fi­nan­cial firms around the world grap­pling with what post-pan­demic work­ing life will look like, with some com­pa­nies such as No­mura seeing op­por­tu­ni­ties to cut costly real es­tate by keep­ing a por­tion of staff at home.</p>
    <p>Al­though the Sin­ga­pore Gov­ern­ment has eased some Covid-19 re­stric­tions, re­mote work is still the de­fault op­tion.</p>
    <p>Cit­i­group is re­view­ing its workspaces be­cause of the virus and look­ing at other ways of work­ing to al­low flex­i­ble ar­range­ments, the spokesman said. The bank on Tues­day said it will open its big­gest wealth man­age­ment hub glob­ally in Sin­ga­pore in De­cem­ber as it aims for dou­ble-digit growth in the na­tion.</p>
