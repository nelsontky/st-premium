    <p>The Covid-19 pan­demic is af­fect­ing the prop­erty mar­ket here in ways not seen in pre­vi­ous re­ces­sions.</p>
    <p>De­spite many work­ers fac­ing in­come and job cuts, prospec­tive bar­gain hunters have been sorely dis­ap­pointed, be­cause over­all prop­erty prices here have been hold­ing up very well.</p>
    <p>In­deed, even the au­thor­i­ties have had to step in to rein in a ris­ing trend of peo­ple who sim­ply make book­ings at new prop­erty launches with­out first as­cer­tain­ing that they are fi­nan­cially able to make the pur­chase.</p>
    <p>Since late Septem­ber, buy­ers have had to con­firm the pur­chase of the book­ing within the va­lid­ity pe­riod, or risk los­ing a sub­stan­tial sum – 25 per cent of their de­posit. For ex­am­ple, they will lose $12,500 if the prop­erty is worth $1 mil­lion.</p>
    <p>What about the in­vest­ment out­look for prop­er­ties – is the rental mar­ket still hold­ing up well enough to ben­e­fit land­lords?</p>
    <p>In past re­ces­sions, rentals fell. For in­stance, the 2009 global fi­nan­cial cri­sis saw a drop in rental val­ues of be­tween 10 per cent and 40 per cent for all prop­er­ties.</p>
    <p>In a sur­pris­ing twist, there is both good and bad news in store for land­lords now, and this largely de­pends on where their prop­er­ties are lo­cated.</p>
    <p>What is un­usual this time is that the rental mar­ket ap­pears to be in­flu­enced by the move­ment and in­come of peo­ple and how they are af­fected by the pan­demic, as op­posed to mas­sive losses in var­i­ous fi­nan­cial-re­lated in­vest­ments.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to Ms Chris­tine Li, who heads the re­search ser­vices team of Cush­man & Wake­field (Sin­ga­pore & South-east Asia), the me­dian rental price for pri­vate apart­ments in Dis­trict 22, which cov­ers Tuas, Jurong and Boon Lay, has seen the big­gest drop of 5.2 per cent to date.</p>
    <p>This is un­sur­pris­ing, con­sid­er­ing that th­ese places are the pre­ferred choice of rental for many Malaysian em­ploy­ees who work in com­pa­nies there.</p>
    <p>With the ex­o­dus of th­ese ten­ants back to their coun­try, the av­er­age rental for a 1,000 sq ft apart­ment has slipped to about $2,900 a month, from over $3,000 last year.</p>
    <p>Fol­low­ing a sim­i­lar trend, the rental in Dis­trict 2, which cov­ers Chi­na­town and Tan­jong Pa­gar, also eased by 4.1 per cent, prob­a­bly due to the de­par­ture of for­eign pro­fes­sional, man­ager, ex­ec­u­tive and tech­ni­cian ten­ants. So a 1,000 sq ft apart­ment in this dis­trict now fetches a me­dian rent of $5,100, down from about $5,400 from last year.</p>
    <p>The other ar­eas that saw rental drop­ping, at around 3.8 per cent, are Dis­trict 6 (City Hall and Clarke Quay), Dis­trict 8 (Far­rer Park and Seran­goon Road) and Dis­trict 11 (New­ton and Novena).</p>
    <p>What about the rental for apart­ments in the prime districts of 9 (Or­chard Road and River Val­ley) and 10 (Tan­glin, Hol­land and Bukit Timah), where some of Sin­ga­pore’s most lux­u­ri­ous con­do­mini­ums are lo­cated? The units in Dis­trict 10 have seen rental drops of about 3.4 per cent, but those in the Or­chard Road area have been af­fected only marginally – at 1.6 per cent.</p>
    <p>For in­stance, the ask­ing rent for two-bed­room units in Scotts Road and Bide­ford Road – which are within min­utes’ walk­ing dis­tance from Or­chard MRT sta­tion – is still hov­er­ing at $7,000 to­day.</p>
    <p>THE HOTTEST RENTAL UNITS</p>
    <p>If you cur­rently own in­vest­ment units in the Beach Road, Bugis and Ro­chor area (Dis­trict 7), you are in for a bonus be­cause the av­er­age rent there has ac­tu­ally gone up by 5.7 per cent. This means that a ten­ant who used to pay a monthly rent of $4,100 there now has to fork out $300 more for the same unit.</p>
    <p>That said, the monthly rent for a good two-bed­room unit in the Beach Road area, which is within walk­ing dis­tance of good shop­ping malls and MRT sta­tions, is still con­sid­er­ably cheaper – at about $5,000 – than those near Or­chard Road.</p>
    <p>Other ar­eas that have seen rent ris­ing – be­tween 3 per cent and 4 per cent – are Dis­trict 3 (Alexan­dra and Com­mon­wealth), Dis­trict 12 (Balestier and Toa Payoh) and Dis­trict 14 (Eunos, Gey­lang and Paya Le­bar).</p>
    <p>A rea­son for the slight in­crease is prob­a­bly due to the com­ple­tion of new projects in the ar­eas – the rental of th­ese new units is likely to have pushed up the over­all rental rates.</p>
    <p>Ms Li noted that not all ten­ants are hard-pressed to pay more rent.</p>
    <p>“The wealthy ex­pa­tri­ates who in­vested in tech stocks are even richer now than be­fore the pan­demic. As such, they are still able to pay high rents, which has re­sulted in rental gains,” she said.</p>
    <p>But be­fore you take this as a pos­i­tive sign to buy prop­er­ties with the in­ten­tion of us­ing rent to cover your mort­gage, note that the rental data does not take into con­sid­er­a­tion Hous­ing Board flats, which of­fer much cheaper rates than pri­vate prop­er­ties.</p>
    <p>There are many three-bed­room units in ma­ture es­tates – such as Bis­han, Toa Payoh, Bukit Merah and Marine Pa­rade – that are go­ing for be­tween $2,000 and $3,000.</p>
    <p>Also, it is a fact that many for­eign ten­ants have al­ready left Sin­ga­pore due to the cur­rent job crunch.</p>
    <p>A long-time prop­erty in­vestor, who wants to be known only as Mr Wong, has two apart­ments in the city area for rent now af­ter both for­eign ten­ants left sud­denly.</p>
    <p>Both units have been left va­cant for over four months, but Mr Wong is pre­pared to wait it out since he has no out­stand­ing mort­gage.</p>
    <p>“I have an ad­van­tage over newer condos as my units are big­ger and in a cen­tral lo­ca­tion. If needed, I am pre­pared to cut rent too, since I have noth­ing to lose,” he said.</p>
