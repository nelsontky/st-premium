    <p>LON­DON • Manch­ester United and Manch­ester City will not be re­quired to com­pete in the open­ing week­end of the 2020-21 Pre­mier League cam­paign fol­low­ing their Euro­pean com­mit­ments this past sea­son, re­ported the Times of Lon­don.</p>
    <p>City’s sea­son came to an end last Satur­day with a 3-1 de­feat by Lyon in the Cham­pi­ons League quar­ter­fi­nals, while United’s sea­son con­cluded fol­low­ing their Europa</p>
    <p>League semi-fi­nal loss to Sevilla a day later.</p>
    <p>The Pre­mier League sea­son is set to be­gin on Sept 12 and with teams re­quir­ing at least a 30-day break be­fore their first match, City and United will likely play their open­ing game the fol­low­ing week, the Times said.</p>
    <p>The fix­tures are ex­pected to be an­nounced by to­mor­row.</p>
    <p>How­ever, Wolver­hamp­ton Wan­der­ers, who were knocked out of the Europa League by Sevilla on Aug 11 – 32 days be­fore the start of the new sea­son – will be re­quired to play on the open­ing week­end.</p>
    <p>There will be no ex­emp­tions for Chelsea ei­ther de­spite Blues man­ager Frank Lampard call­ing for a de­layed start.</p>
    <p>“The 12th feels too early for me for the play­ers to start play­ing again,” the for­mer mid­fielder said after his side’s FA Cup fi­nal de­feat by Arse­nal on Aug 1.</p>
    <p>“The play­ers need a break... I would like to think the Pre­mier League would look se­ri­ously at that and hope­fully give us a fair start next sea­son.</p>
    <p>“We de­serve to be, as a Pre­mier League club com­pet­ing in the Cham­pi­ons League.”</p>
    <p>Chelsea’s last game of the sea­son was on Aug 8, when they lost 4-1 to Bay­ern Mu­nich in their Cham­pi­ons League last-16 se­cond leg, bow­ing out 7-1 on ag­gre­gate.</p>
