    <p>Judg­ing from the fu­ri­ous re­ac­tions of Straits Times Face­book users over what a youth said to a do­mes­tic helper, the say­ing, “Sticks and stones may break my bones but words will never hurt me”, does not ring true.</p>
    <p>Re­fer­ring to a dis­pute be­tween Ng Jia Sheng, now 20, and his fam­ily’s do­mes­tic helper, a deputy pub­lic prose­cu­tor had said ear­lier: “Dur­ing the al­ter­ca­tion, the ac­cused told the vic­tim that she was only a maid, was poor and had no right to be in Sin­ga­pore.”</p>
    <p>Not that “sticks and stones” in the form of a metal mug be­ing flung at the helper were not in­volved.</p>
    <p>The Sin­ga­porean had pleaded guilty in June to us­ing crim­i­nal force on Ms Esta­billo Soledad Agustin in 2018, as well as caus­ing griev­ous hurt by per­form­ing a rash act. He also ad­mit­ted to us­ing in­sult­ing words on the Filip­ina that caused her alarm, which is an of­fence un­der the Pro­tec­tion from Ha­rass­ment Act.</p>
    <p>Af­ter Ng was sen­tenced on Tues­day to at least six months’ re­for­ma­tive train­ing, ST Face­book users re­flected on how some peo­ple in Sin­ga­pore treat their helpers badly. They were ap­palled and ashamed that there were Sin­ga­pore­ans who thought be­ing poor was a char­ac­ter flaw.</p>
    <p>Xing Ja­son said: “Is this even morally right? Some­one who thinks that poor peo­ple have no right to ex­ist in Sin­ga­pore?”</p>
    <p>Aan Al-Shar­iff said: “I felt ashamed hav­ing such a Sin­ga­porean who looks down on poor peo­ple.”</p>
    <p>They also ap­pealed for em­pa­thy for peo­ple leav­ing their loved ones be­hind in their home coun­tries to try to eke out a liv­ing in a for­eign land.</p>
    <p>Richard Ang wrote: “Peo­ple should not look down on the poor who work to help sup­port their fam­i­lies. They are also hu­mans who de­serve to be re­spected in do­ing a de­cent job.”</p>
    <p>Rhea Jane Tor­res Siruno wrote: “Why do some folks treat peo­ple rudely and badly? It is re­ally hard for them to be away from their fam­i­lies just to find a good op­por­tu­nity to earn money to send home. But then, most of them end up in such bad sit­u­a­tions.</p>
    <p>“They’re be­ing paid min­i­mum only per month, but some of the em­ploy­ers think that they bought them.”</p>
    <p>PROPER EM­PLOY­EES, PROPER RE­SPECT</p>
    <p>Come on. In case you have not no­ticed, do­mes­tic helpers are proper em­ploy­ees.</p>
    <p>Just be­cause they are liv­ing in your homes and dressed humbly while wash­ing your dirty un­der­wear does not mean you can smack them around, or smack-talk them. They need to be treated the same as em­ploy­ees wear­ing busi­ness out­fits in fancy of­fice set­tings, in which you would think twice be­fore you start hurl­ing mugs or in­sults.</p>
    <p>ST Face­book user Ta­nia Kus­tanto-Yew said: “A lot of em­ploy­ers don’t un­der­stand that they are also hu­man be­ings who are just try­ing to earn a liv­ing, just like most of us.”</p>
    <p>In these aw­ful eco­nomic times, even the rich­est and most hard-work­ing among us might one day find our­selves scrub­bing other peo­ple’s toi­lets just to make ends meet. Would you like some­one to then yell at you for be­ing poor and for not be­long­ing?</p>
    <p>Eva Vil­las said: “Be nice to your helper, so your helper will do the same to you. If you treat your helper as a stranger or dif­fer­ent per­son be­cause her sta­tus is lower than yours, you are not qual­i­fied to have a helper, like­wise, you are not qual­i­fied to be a boss.”</p>
    <p>How­ever, another ST Face­book user, Yap Tai San, had a dif­fer­ent point of view, say­ing: “Eva Vil­las, I don’t to­tally agree with you. My neigh­bour just got robbed by her maid of 12 years. Trusted her so much, ended up (she) stole her jew­ellery and pawned it.”</p>
    <p>He Huiyi said: “Yap Tai San, I agree. The state­ment may ap­ply to some helpers, but def­i­nitely not all. Dif­fer­ent up­bring­ing with dif­fer­ent back­grounds will pro­duce helpers of dif­fer­ent morals too. I heard of many sto­ries of helpers who worked for many years and things hap­pen es­pe­cially when they are re­turn­ing home. And of course, there are cases of loyal helpers who ded­i­cate their lives work­ing for some em­ploy­ers. At the end of the day, it boils down to the char­ac­ter and morals of the helper.”</p>
    <p>Well, you can say the same for the em­ploy­ees wear­ing busi­ness out­fits in fancy of­fice set­tings. It is true that some end up as loyal work friends, while oth­ers are wait­ing to rob you blind.</p>
    <p>But the proper way to han­dle em­ploy­ees is to do so in a pro­fes­sional man­ner, with­out hitting them or in­sult­ing them.</p>
    <p>If they com­mit crimes, take them to the po­lice sta­tion and throw the book at them, and not metal mugs.</p>
