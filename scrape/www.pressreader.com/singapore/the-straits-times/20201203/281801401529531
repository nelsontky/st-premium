    <p>ROME • Italy will launch a mas­sive, free coro­n­avirus vac­ci­na­tion pro­gramme early next year, with health work­ers and the el­derly to be given pri­or­ity, Health Min­is­ter Roberto Sper­anza told Par­lia­ment yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>“We fi­nally see land, we have a clear route to a safe har­bour... It seems likely that from Jan­uary we will have the first vac­cines,” he told the Se­nate.</p>
    <p>Mr Sper­anza said the gov­ern­ment had op­tions to buy 202 mil­lion Covid-19 vac­cine shots from var­i­ous com­pa­nies. It is await­ing clear­ance for their us­age from Euro­pean drug au­thor­i­ties.</p>
    <p>Italy was the first Western coun­try hit by the virus, reg­is­ter­ing 56,361 deaths since the out­break emerged in Fe­bru­ary, the sec­ond-high­est toll in Europe af­ter Bri­tain’s.</p>
    <p>Italy has also reg­is­tered 1.62 mil­lion cases to date. Health op­er­a­tors, el­derly peo­ple and those liv­ing in nurs­ing homes will be vac­ci­nated first, Mr Sper­anza said, adding that the main part of the campaign will be car­ried out be­tween spring and sum­mer next year.</p>
    <p>Early last month, Italy de­cided to im­pose new re­stric­tions to rein in a sec­ond wave of its coro­n­avirus epi­demic, putting un­der par­tial lock­down much of its in­dus­trial north and lim­it­ing busi­ness ac­tiv­ity.</p>
    <p>The num­ber of daily cases has de­clined in the past week but the gov­ern­ment is ex­pected to limit peo­ple’s move­ment dur­ing the Christ­mas and New Year hol­i­days to pre­vent any new surge in in­fec­tions.</p>
    <p>“Our in­ten­tion is to limit travel abroad and be­tween re­gions dur­ing the win­ter hol­i­days,” Mr Sper­anza said.</p>
