    <p>The crim­i­nal defama­tion trial of The On­line Cit­i­zen (TOC) web­site’s chief ed­i­tor Terry Xu, 38, and TOC con­trib­u­tor Daniel De Costa, 37, be­gan yes­ter­day over an e-mail penned by De Costa that al­legedly de­famed Cabi­net mem­bers. De Costa is said to have sent that and other in­flam­ma­tory ma­te­rial from the e-mail ac­count of his friend, Mr Sim Wee Lee, who took the wit­ness stand yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The crim­i­nal defama­tion trial of The On­line Cit­i­zen (TOC) web­site’s chief ed­i­tor Terry Xu, 38, and TOC con­trib­u­tor Daniel De Costa, 37, be­gan yes­ter­day, over an e-mail let­ter penned by De Costa that al­legedly de­famed Cabi­net mem­bers.</p>
    <p>De Costa is said to have sent that and other in­flam­ma­tory ma­te­rial from the e-mail ac­count of his friend, Mr Sim Wee Lee, who took the wit­ness stand yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>In his ex­am­i­na­tion of Mr Sim, Deputy Pub­lic Prose­cu­tor Senthilku­maran Saba­p­a­thy sought to estab­lish that De Costa had used Mr Sim’s e-mail ac­counts with­out per­mis­sion on mul­ti­ple oc­ca­sions since 2011.</p>
    <p>The case in­volves an e-mail that De Costa sent to TOC from Mr Sim’s Ya­hoo ac­count in Septem­ber 2018.</p>
    <p>The let­ter stated, among other things, that there was “cor­rup­tion at the high­est ech­e­lons” of the Peo­ple’s Ac­tion Party lead­er­ship.</p>
    <p>TOC, a so­ciopo­lit­i­cal web­site, then pub­lished the let­ter and at­trib­uted it to Willy Sum, a name some­times used by Mr Sim.</p>
    <p>Xu and De Costa were each charged with one count of crim­i­nal defama­tion in De­cem­ber 2018 for de­fam­ing mem­bers of the Sin­ga­pore Cabi­net in the let­ter.</p>
    <p>De Costa was also charged un­der the Com­puter Mis­use Act for us­ing Mr Sim’s Ya­hoo e-mail ac­count to send the let­ter with­out per­mis­sion.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, Mr Sim tes­ti­fied that he had shared the pass­words to his Ya­hoo and Gmail ac­counts with De Costa af­ter they be­came friends some time be­tween 2005 and 2006.</p>
    <p>He did so as his own com­mand of English was poor and he needed De Costa’s help to com­pose and send e-mails to gov­ern­ment of­fi­cials on his be­half, Mr Sim told the court through a Man­darin in­ter­preter.</p>
    <p>“I was very grate­ful to Daniel be­cause, at the time, I was fac­ing bank­ruptcy pro­ceed­ings and also prob­lems with HDB and traf­fic sum­monses is­sued against me,” he said.</p>
    <p>The court heard that, aside from the ap­peals that Mr Sim had asked De Costa to write, his e-mail ac­counts were also be­ing used to send po­lit­i­cally charged e-mails on more than 20 oc­ca­sions since 2011, in­clud­ing com­plaints ad­dressed to var­i­ous politi­cians and gov­ern­ment agen­cies, as well as let­ters to TOC and other web­sites.</p>
    <p>The let­ters com­mented on var­i­ous po­lit­i­cal mat­ters such as the Gen­eral Elec­tion, MPs’ ex­changes in Par­lia­ment and the Ox­ley Road dis­pute be­tween Prime Min­is­ter Lee Hsien Loong and his sib­lings, among other things. Some were pub­lished in TOC un­der dif­fer­ent vari­ants of Mr Sim’s name, such as “WL Sum” and “Willy Sim”.</p>
    <p>Mr Sim said the unau­tho­rised emails were likely writ­ten by De Costa as no­body else had ac­cess to his e-mail ac­counts.</p>
    <p>How­ever, even af­ter he learnt of the unau­tho­rised e-mails, Mr Sim said he did not change his pass­words or take other steps to pre­vent De Costa from us­ing his ac­counts, as his is­sues had not been re­solved and he still needed De Costa’s help.</p>
    <p>“I was very an­gry be­cause the many e-mails did not go through me. His e-mails were mostly crit­i­cis­ing gov­ern­ment of­fi­cers and mak­ing bad com­ments about them,” Mr Sim told the court.</p>
    <p>“I treated him as a friend and asked him not to send mes­sages or post any­thing to crit­i­cise gov­ern­ment of­fi­cers. I was also wor­ried some­thing might hap­pen to him.”</p>
    <p>Mr Sim said it came as a sur­prise when po­lice came knock­ing in Novem­ber 2018 to in­ves­ti­gate the defama­tion of­fence and con­fis­cate his phone and com­puter. He then told po­lice that De Costa was the only other per­son who had ac­cess to the Ya­hoo ac­count used to send the al­legedly defam­a­tory let­ter.</p>
    <p>The prose­cu­tor asked how the defama­tion in­ves­ti­ga­tion had af­fected his life, to which Mr Sim said he had faced many dif­fi­cul­ties in the last two years that left him feel­ing “on the verge of a break­down”.</p>
    <p>He said: “I only hope this mat­ter will come to an end soon. As for Daniel’s ac­tions, I don’t know if he in­ten­tion­ally or un­in­ten­tion­ally brought harm to me, but I choose to for­give him.”</p>
    <p>The trial con­tin­ues to­day, with lawyers for the de­fence cross-ex­am­in­ing Mr Sim.</p>
    <p>TREATED HIM AS A FRIEND I was very an­gry be­cause the many e-mails did not go through me. His e-mails were mostly crit­i­cis­ing gov­ern­ment of­fi­cers and mak­ing bad com­ments about them. I treated him as a friend and asked him not to send mes­sages or post any­thing to crit­i­cise gov­ern­ment of­fi­cers. I was also wor­ried some­thing might hap­pen to him. MR SIM WEE LEE, who said his e-mail ac­counts were used by Daniel De Costa.</p>
