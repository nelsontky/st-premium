    <p>LON­DON • Bri­tain’s move to de­lay the sec­ond doses of Covid-19 vac­cines will help save lives as more peo­ple will be able to get some ini­tial pro­tec­tion, Health Min­is­ter Matt Han­cock has said, de­fend­ing a pol­icy shift ques­tioned by some sci­en­tists.</p>
    <p>The abrupt change of tack on Dec 30 meant peo­ple due to re­ceive their sec­ond vac­cine doses had their ap­point­ments can­celled in favour of sched­ul­ing more ini­tial shots for oth­ers.</p>
    <p>Some sci­en­tists have ex­pressed doubts about al­ter­ing proven dos­ing regimes, but Mr Han­cock said par­tial pro­tec­tion for more peo­ple would do more good than full pro­tec­tion for a se­lect few.</p>
    <p>“The jus­ti­fi­ca­tion is re­ally clear and straight­for­ward, which is that it saves more lives, and ul­ti­mately, that is the public health jus­ti­fi­ca­tion,” Mr Han­cock said on Thurs­day. “The data shows that there is a sig­nif­i­cant pro­tec­tion from both the Ox­ford and the Pfizer jabs af­ter the first dose.”</p>
    <p>Al­most 1.5 mil­lion doses have been de­ployed in Bri­tain. But only 21,000 sec­ond doses of the Pfizer shot were given be­tween Dec 29 – when the first peo­ple to be vac­ci­nated re­ceived their boost­ers – and Jan 3.</p>
    <p>The day af­ter sec­ond vac­ci­na­tions be­gan, of­fi­cials said they would pri­ori­tise giv­ing as many peo­ple as pos­si­ble a first shot to of­fer some pro­tec­tion over the roll­out of booster shots. That means sec­ond shots will now be given up to 12 weeks af­ter the first.</p>
    <p>Na­tional Health Ser­vice Eng­land CEO Si­mon Stevens said that 12 days af­ter the first dose, a per­son might have 90 per cent or more of the ben­e­fit of the vac­ci­na­tion. “It means that we’re able to of­fer vac­ci­na­tion to many more peo­ple – twice as many peo­ple with that Pfizer dos­ing – over the next sev­eral weeks,” he said.</p>
    <p>While As­traZeneca’s shot was tested with dif­fer­ent in­ter­vals be­tween doses, Pfizer has said there is no data to demon­strate the ef­fi­cacy of its first dose af­ter 21 days.</p>
    <p>Prime Min­is­ter Boris John­son hopes that by giv­ing at least some pro­tec­tion to more than 13 mil­lion peo­ple in pri­or­ity groups over the next six weeks, it will be pos­si­ble to con­sider eas­ing strict lock­down mea­sures from mid-Fe­bru­ary.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, all pas­sen­gers ar­riv­ing in Bri­tain will have to show a neg­a­tive Covid-19 test re­sult taken within 72 hours of the start of their jour­ney.</p>
    <p>Un­der rules an­nounced yes­ter­day, any­one fail­ing to do so will be fined £500 (S$900). The mea­sures, set out by Trans­port Sec­re­tary Grant Shapps, will come into force next week for those ar­riv­ing in Bri­tain by plane, boat or train.</p>
    <p>Trav­ellers ar­riv­ing from coun­tries not on the gov­ern­ment’s open travel cor­ri­dor list have to iso­late at home for 10 days, re­gard­less of their test re­sults.</p>
    <p>The plan is aimed at stop­ping new strains of Covid-19 com­ing into Bri­tain, such as the one iden­ti­fied in South Africa.</p>
    <p>“The South African vari­ant is wor­ry­ing the ex­perts be­cause it may be that the vac­cine doesn’t re­spond in the same way,” Mr Shapps said yes­ter­day. “If that was the case it would be a tragedy to al­low that into the coun­try.”</p>
    <p>En­try to Eng­land will also be banned to those who have trav­elled from or through any south­ern African coun­try in the pre­vi­ous 10 days, the gov­ern­ment said. The coun­tries in­clude Namibia, Zim­babwe and Botswana.</p>
    <p>There will be some ex­emp­tions from the new rules, in­clud­ing for haulers, chil­dren un­der the age of 11, and for trav­ellers leav­ing coun­tries with­out an ad­e­quate test­ing in­fra­struc­ture in place.</p>
    <p>SUF­FI­CIENT PRO­TEC­TION</p>
    <p>The jus­ti­fi­ca­tion is re­ally clear and straight­for­ward, which is that it saves more lives...</p>
    <p>The data shows that there is a sig­nif­i­cant pro­tec­tion from both the Ox­ford and the Pfizer jabs af­ter the first dose.</p>
