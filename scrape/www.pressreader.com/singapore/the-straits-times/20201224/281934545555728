    <p>This year was sup­posed to be a joy­ous one when my son would fin­ish his A lev­els in Auck­land, and my whole fam­ily – my wife in Sin­ga­pore; the rest of us, com­pris­ing me, my son, our eight-year-old French bull­dog Cae­sar, and our 71/2-year-old cava­lier King Charles spaniel Max, in Auck­land – would be re­united in Sin­ga­pore af­ter five long years.</p>
    <p>Then Covid-19 wrecked our plan.</p>
    <p>In con­sul­ta­tion with all the pet trans­port com­pa­nies in New Zealand, Qan­tas was the only air­line that would ship brachy­cephalic breeds (snub-nosed dogs).</p>
    <p>How­ever, due to the pan­demic’s im­pact on the global econ­omy, Qan­tas could not con­firm when it would restart its in­ter­na­tional flights.</p>
    <p>De­spite know­ing Sin­ga­pore Air­lines’ (SIA) pol­icy of not ship­ping brachy­cephalic dogs, I started my ap­peal process in July, to ask that an ex­cep­tion be made for our dogs. The first try was un­suc­cess­ful.</p>
    <p>How­ever, Ms Rachel Chan from the Sin­ga­pore High Com­mis­sion in Welling­ton, whom I ap­proached for help in my ap­peal, sug­gested that I try again to­wards the end of the year.</p>
    <p>Early last month, with her help, we learnt that SIA would now be able to fly Cae­sar and Max back to Sin­ga­pore if we could find a vet to ac­com­pany them.</p>
    <p>Al­most im­me­di­ately af­ter my out­reach to Massey Univer­sity’s vet school, fi­nal-year stu­dent Jonathan Che­ung con­tacted me, vol­un­teer­ing to help us out.</p>
    <p>My wife and I were very im­pressed by and grate­ful for the SIA Auck­land team’s proac­tive as­sis­tance, and the seam­less ex­pe­ri­ence of fly­ing Cae­sar and Max back to Sin­ga­pore last Thurs­day.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing these un­cer­tain times brought about by Covid-19, what is most heart­warm­ing is the Sin­ga­porean spirit shown by Sin­ga­porean com­pa­nies help­ing fel­low Sin­ga­pore­ans.</p>
    <p>Cae­sar and Max are now back with us, and set­tling well in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>All this would not have been pos­si­ble with­out the life­line pro­vided by SIA Cargo.</p>
