    <p>The joint hear­ing of two law­suits against Mustafa Cen­tre boss Mus­taq Ah­mad and his fam­ily has come to an end, af­ter lawyers for the de­fen­dants as­serted there was no need for him and oth­ers to give ev­i­dence.</p>
    <p>In a rare move, lawyers for Mr Mus­taq and the other de­fen­dants told the High Court they would be mak­ing a sub­mis­sion of “no case to an­swer”.</p>
    <p>This means the de­fen­dants are con­tend­ing the plain­tiffs have not pro­vided suf­fi­cient ev­i­dence to make out the key el­e­ments of their claims, and the de­fen­dants, there­fore, do not need to call ev­i­dence of their own.</p>
    <p>The trial, which be­gan on Oct 13 and was heard over 20 days be­fore com­ing to an end on Mon­day, saw 21 wit­nesses tes­ti­fy­ing for the two sets of plain­tiffs. Seven of the wit­nesses tes­ti­fied in both suits.</p>
    <p>Both suits cen­tre on Mo­hamed Mustafa and Sam­sud­din Co (MMSC), the com­pany be­hind the pop­u­lar de­part­ment store in Syed Alwi Road.</p>
    <p>Be­sides Mr Mus­taq, the other de­fen­dants are his wife Ishret Ja­han, their chil­dren Shama and Osama, and Madam Ishret’s brother Iqbal.</p>
    <p>All five are di­rec­tors of the com­pany.</p>
    <p>One suit was brought by Mr Mus­taq’s step­fam­ily, who are rep­re­sented by Se­nior Coun­sel Davin­der Singh and Mr Jaikanth Shankar.</p>
    <p>The other was brought by two sons of Mr Mus­taq’s late busi­ness part­ner Sam­sud­din Mokhtar Ah­mad, who are also his dis­tant cousins. They are rep­re­sented by Mr Sar­b­jit Singh Cho­pra and Mr Sean La’Brooy.</p>
    <p>The plain­tiffs ac­cused the de­fen­dants of di­lut­ing the in­ter­ests of Mr Mus­taq’s fa­ther Mo­hamed Mustafa and Mr Sam­sud­din, pay­ing them­selves ex­ces­sive direc­tor fees and mis­ap­pro­pri­at­ing money.</p>
    <p>The plain­tiffs claimed the com­pany’s af­fairs had been con­ducted in a way that is op­pres­sive to their in­ter­ests as mi­nor­ity share­hold­ers.</p>
    <p>Mr Mus­taq, rep­re­sented by Se­nior Coun­sel Alvin Yeo and Ms Koh Swee Yen, con­tended he was the pa­tri­arch who had pro­vided for his ex­tended fam­ily over the years.</p>
    <p>He al­leged the law­suits were driven by greed for more as­sets and money, and were filed af­ter his fa­ther and Mr Sam­sud­din, who died in 2001 and 2011 re­spec­tively, could no longer tes­tify.</p>
    <p>MMSC was in­cor­po­rated in 1989 by Mr Mus­taq and Mr Sam­sud­din. Mr Mus­taq’s fa­ther Mustafa and Mr Mus­taq’s wife were later added as share­hold­ers.</p>
    <p>Be­tween 1989 and 2001, Mr Mus­taq’s stake went from 51 per cent to 61.25 per cent, while Mr Sam­sud­din’s share went from 30 per cent to 15.12 per cent.</p>
    <p>Mr Mustafa’s ini­tial stake was 19 per cent but, af­ter his death, the pro­por­tion held by his es­tate be­came 14.89 per cent.</p>
    <p>Mr Mus­taq’s step­brother Ayaz Ahmed said it was af­ter he en­gaged a con­sul­tant to look into the com­pany’s af­fairs in 2016, that he found out about “wrong­ful” al­lot­ments which in­creased Mr Mus­taq’s share­hold­ings.</p>
    <p>Mr Ayaz, his broth­ers Ish­tiaq and Maaz, and their mother Asia, who goes by one name, were among the wit­nesses who gave ev­i­dence. Oth­ers in­cluded foren­sic ac­count­ing ex­pert Owen Hawkes and val­u­a­tion ex­pert Mark Col­lard.</p>
    <p>Mr Sam­sud­din’s sons Fayyaz and An­sar are claim­ing a one-third share of the Mustafa busi­ness em­pire and as­sets owned by Mr Mus­taq in var­i­ous coun­tries.</p>
    <p>Wit­nesses in­cluded foren­sic ac­count­ing ex­pert Chee Yoh Chuang.</p>
    <p>The case has been ad­journed for writ­ten sub­mis­sions to be filed by Jan 11, and Ju­di­cial Com­mis­sioner Mavis Chionh is ex­pected to give her ver­dict on March 8.</p>
