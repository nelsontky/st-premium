    <p>LON­DON • Am­ber Heard de­nied hav­ing an af­fair with bil­lion­aire en­tre­pre­neur Elon Musk, as she gave ev­i­dence in ex-hus­band Johnny Depp’s high-pro­file Lon­don li­bel ac­tion on Tues­day.</p>
    <p>Depp, 57, had ac­cused the 34-year-old ac­tress of hav­ing li­aisons with the Tesla and SpaceX founder and Hol­ly­wood ac­tor James Franco dur­ing their stormy two-year mar­riage.</p>
    <p>But giv­ing ev­i­dence, she re­jected the claims, in par­tic­u­lar dis­miss­ing sug­ges­tions that Musk vis­ited her reg­u­larly at night from March 2015, not long after the cou­ple wed.</p>
    <p>“I wasn’t even in com­mu­ni­ca­tion with Elon un­til 2016,” she told Lon­don’s High Court on her sec­ond day on the wit­ness stand.</p>
    <p>Depp, star of The Pi­rates Of The Caribbean fran­chise (2003 to 2017), is su­ing Bri­tish tabloid The Sun and the au­thor of a 2018 ar­ti­cle that claimed he was a wife-beater. He main­tains it se­verely dam­aged his rep­u­ta­tion.</p>
    <p>Depp’s lawyer, Ms Eleanor Laws, read out a 2016 text mes­sage sent by Mr Musk of­fer­ing pro­tec­tion against Depp after an al­leged fight be­tween the cou­ple. “The of­fer would stand, even if you never wanted to see me again... any­way, sorry for be­ing an id­iot,” he wrote. “The ra­dio silence hurts a lot. It only mat­ters be­cause I re­ally like you.”</p>
    <p>The text was sent the day after Heard claims Depp hit her in the face with a mo­bile phone dur­ing an ar­gu­ment, and while she was con­sid­er­ing get­ting a re­strain­ing or­der.</p>
    <p>The court was shown se­cu­rity cam­era footage of Heard and Franco after a row with Depp in May 2016, but Heard said the claim that she was hav­ing an af­fair was “quite wrong”.</p>
    <p>“We were talk­ing. He was say­ing to me, ‘Oh my god, what hap­pened to you?’” she told the court.</p>
    <p>On Mon­day, she claimed Depp had threat­ened to kill her on a num­ber of oc­ca­sions and sub­jected her to ver­bal and phys­i­cal vi­o­lence while un­der the in­flu­ence of drink and drugs.</p>
    <p>The cou­ple met on the set of the 2011 film The Rum Di­ary and their re­la­tion­ship veered from “in­tensely af­fec­tion­ate, warm and charm­ing” to “very in­tense and dark”.</p>
    <p>She said the ac­tor blamed his ac­tions on a “self-cre­ated third party” he some­times named “the mon­ster” and that she stayed in the re­la­tion­ship be­cause she thought she could “fix” his well doc­u­mented prob­lems.</p>
    <p>The Sun’s pub­lisher, News Group News­pa­pers, ar­gues it told the truth in its re­port and that it has ev­i­dence to prove 14 al­leged in­ci­dents of do­mes­tic vi­o­lence.</p>
    <p>The case is now in its third week and has lifted the lid on Depp’s drunken and drug-fu­elled life­style. But he de­nies be­ing vi­o­lent to any woman and has sought to por­tray his ex-wife as a cal­cu­lat­ing, dis­hon­est and so­cio­pathic nar­cis­sist in­tent on de­stroy­ing his life.</p>
