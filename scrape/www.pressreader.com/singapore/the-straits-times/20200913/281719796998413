    <p>Ms NoorJa­han Ka­marud­din, 60, has em­braced nav­i­ga­tional apps such as Google Maps and the Land Trans­port Author­ity’s MyTrans­port.SG app. To help other se­niors like her­self reap the ben­e­fits of such apps, the vol­un­teer has con­ducted lessons on how to use them to search for bus and train routes.</p>
    <p>Soon, 500 se­nior vol­un­teers like Ms NoorJa­han will be trained an­nu­ally over two years to be­come Smart Na­tion Am­bas­sadors, who will coach oth­ers on how to use dig­i­tal ca­pa­bil­i­ties in their ev­ery­day lives.</p>
    <p>This will be part of a gov­ern­ment col­lab­o­ra­tion with the com­mu­nity, un­der a two-year mem­o­ran­dum of un­der­stand­ing (MOU) signed by RSVP Sin­ga­pore, an or­gan­i­sa­tion for se­nior vol­un­teers, and the Smart Na­tion and Dig­i­tal Gov­ern­ment Of­fice yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The two sides will also co-develop an on­line learn­ing por­tal for Smart Na­tion Am­bas­sadors to learn soft skills and in­for­ma­tion on Smart Na­tion ini­tia­tives. The por­tal will be open to the pub­lic, with cour­ses that will help users fa­mil­iarise them­selves with dig­i­tal gov­ern­ment ser­vices, among other things.</p>
    <p>The MOU will drive deeper en­gage­ment with se­niors on us­ing tech­nol­ogy, and will help to cul­ti­vate a pool of tech-savvy se­niors who can help each other on their dig­i­tal jour­neys, said Se­nior Min­is­ter of State for Com­mu­ni­ca­tions and In­for­ma­tion Janil Puthuc­heary dur­ing the event, which was livestream­ed on Face­book.</p>
    <p>He gave the ex­am­ple of Mr Steric Tan, 71, a Smart Na­tion Am­bas­sador. When the cir­cuit breaker was an­nounced ear­lier this year to curb the spread of Covid-19, Mr Tan taught se­niors how to con­duct video con­fer­enc­ing us­ing What­sApp and Zoom so they could stay in touch with their fam­ily and friends.</p>
    <p>Mr Tan also con­ducted virtual lessons over Zoom on how to use SafeEn­try to check in at su­per­mar­kets when it was first in­tro­duced.</p>
    <p>Dr Janil said: “Smart Na­tion is not just for the young, it’s not just about the young, and it’s not just by the young.</p>
    <p>“Our se­niors have an equal part to play. They will ben­e­fit. They can teach us how to do this. They can take us along the jour­ney.”</p>
    <p>This year, the new SG Dig­i­tal Of­fice (SDO) was launched to re­cruit 1,000 dig­i­tal am­bas­sadors by the end of June to help stall­hold­ers and se­niors learn how to use dig­i­tal tools. Since then, about 16,000 se­niors have been sup­ported by SDO, said Dr Janil.</p>
    <p>Thirty SG Dig­i­tal Com­mu­nity Hubs have also been set up across Sin­ga­pore, with 25 more that can be ex­pected in the com­ing months, he added.</p>
    <p>An on­line plat­form where Sin­ga­pore­ans can learn new dig­i­tal skills such as cod­ing or find out about the lat­est tech­no­log­i­cal trends was also launched by SNDGO this year un­der the name #SmartNa­tionTo­gether.</p>
    <p>So far, more than 6,000 par­tic­i­pants have ben­e­fited from 80 on­line pro­grammes for chil­dren, young par­ents, work­ing adults and se­niors, said Dr Janil.</p>
    <p>Smart Na­tion Am­bas­sadors like Mr Tan are also teach­ing other se­niors how to spot po­ten­tial scams on­line, such as spoofed gov­ern­ment web­site links.</p>
    <p>“They usu­ally will for­get but we just have to be very pa­tient with them. We also have a chat group to­gether so I’m al­ways avail­able to an­swer their ques­tions if they are not clear about whether some­thing could be a scam,” he told The Sun­day Times yes­ter­day.</p>
