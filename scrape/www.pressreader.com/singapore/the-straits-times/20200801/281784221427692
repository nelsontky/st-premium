    <p>• The epi­cen­tre of the coro­n­avirus pan­demic in the United States has shown signs of shift­ing to the Mid­west, while Sun Belt states in the south­ern stretch were hope­ful that new in­fec­tions and deaths were start­ing to de­cline.</p>
    <p>The Covid-19 out­break was mov­ing into Ohio, Ken­tucky, Ten­nessee, Mis­souri, Kansas and Ne­braska “be­cause of va­ca­tions and other rea­sons of travel”, Dr Deb­o­rah Birx, co­or­di­na­tor of the White House coro­n­avirus task force, told Fox News on Thurs­day.</p>
    <p>Ohio’s health de­part­ment said the state had seen its high­est sin­gle-day in­crease in in­fec­tions on Thurs­day since the pan­demic started in Jan­uary, which Gover­nor Mike DeWine, a Repub­li­can, told re­porters was “cer­tainly not good news”.</p>
    <p>In Wis­con­sin, Gover­nor Tony Evers or­dered res­i­dents to wear face cov­er­ings in pub­lic.</p>
    <p>Masks are rec­om­mended by many health ex­perts, but some con­ser­va­tives say such man­dates vi­o­late the US Con­sti­tu­tion.</p>
    <p>“While I know emo­tions are high when it comes to wear­ing face cov­er­ings in pub­lic, my job as gover­nor is to put peo­ple first and to do what’s best for the peo­ple of our state, so that’s what I am go­ing to do,” the Demo­crat said.</p>
    <p>Florida re­ported a record sin­gle­day in­crease in Covid-19 deaths for a third con­sec­u­tive day on Thurs­day and Ari­zona also re­ported a record in­crease in fa­tal­i­ties for a sin­gle day, ac­cord­ing to a Reuters tally.</p>
    <p>But re­ports of new cases have re­cently slowed in both states, along with Cal­i­for­nia and Texas.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to the tem­po­rary health­care staffing plat­form NurseFly, de­mand for nurses in Ari­zona in­creased 75 per cent last month over June.</p>
    <p>“I’m try­ing to just main­tain a healthy level of anx­i­ety,” said Ms Rachel Nor­ton, a trav­el­ling in­ten­sive care unit nurse who was leav­ing Den­ver on Thurs­day for a one-month con­tract in Mesa, Ari­zona.</p>
    <p>The surge has damp­ened the na­tion’s re­cov­ery from an eco­nomic cri­sis brought on by lock­down or­ders that have thrown mil­lions out of work, closed schools and shut­tered en­ter­tain­ment and pro­fes­sional sports events.</p>
    <p>The US re­mains the coun­try most af­fected by the pan­demic, with a death toll of more than 155,000.</p>
    <p>Smok­ing out­side a food bank in Chicago, 63-year-old Mr William Han­nah said the pan­demic “has ru­ined me”. “I’m now job­less, home­less and wait­ing for my job to come back.”</p>
    <p>He was work­ing as a cook at the United Cen­tre, home of the Chicago</p>
    <p>Bulls and Black­hawks, be­fore the Na­tional Bas­ket­ball As­so­ci­a­tion and Na­tional Hockey League can­celled games and en­ter­tain­ers halted events.</p>
    <p>On Thurs­day, Com­merce De­part­ment data for the sec­ond quar­ter showed the deep­est con­trac­tion in the US econ­omy since the Great De­pres­sion of the 1930s. Its gross do­mes­tic prod­uct col­lapsed at a 32.9 per cent an­nu­alised rate last quar­ter.</p>
    <p>Mr Her­man Cain, a for­mer Repub­li­can pres­i­den­tial can­di­date, be­came the lat­est high-pro­file death at­trib­uted to Covid-19 on Thurs­day.</p>
    <p>He was di­ag­nosed with the dis­ease in late June af­ter at­tend­ing a Tulsa, Ok­la­homa, rally for Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump, where many crowded to­gether with­out face masks. Mr Cain tweeted a photo of him­self with­out a mask.</p>
    <p>The out­break ini­tially cen­tred on the north-east­ern re­gion around New York, which still has by far the high­est to­tal of fa­tal­i­ties in any state, at more than 32,000.</p>
    <p>Mr Mark Levine, chair of the New York City Coun­cil health com­mit­tee, said cases were ris­ing again in north-east­ern states, specif­i­cally New Jer­sey, Con­necti­cut and Mas­sachusetts.</p>
    <p>“For the first time since spring, cases are ris­ing again in all three,” he wrote in a se­ries of tweets. “NY is now an is­land within an is­land, with warn­ing signs loom­ing on all sides.”</p>
