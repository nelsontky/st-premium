    <p>Sin­ga­pore­ans al­ways love a good scare, and a lo­cal tour that sends chills up the spine is pay­ing off hand­somely for a travel com­pany here, amid the sharp dive in for­eign tourist fig­ures.</p>
    <p>Ori­en­tal Travel and Tours’ The Creepy Tales of Sin­ga­pore is of­ten sold out.</p>
    <p>The night tour was launched last Novem­ber, and was de­vel­oped as part of the Sin­ga­pore Tourism Board’s Tour De­sign Chal­lenge, aimed at com­ing up with new lo­cal tours.</p>
    <p>Un­like sight­see­ing tours to well­known spots in Sin­ga­pore, the un­con­ven­tional night tour is not for the faint of heart, as par­tic­i­pants are taken to see tombs and war mas­sacre sites.</p>
    <p>The free­lance tour guides who set up the firm in 2017 – Mr Stan­ley Foo, 44, and Ms Jas­mine Tan, 52 – saw the mar­ket for a spooky ex­pe­ri­ence in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>They met in 2016 at a tour guid­ing course. Nei­ther had rel­e­vant ex­pe­ri­ence and had used their Skills Fu­ture Credit to at­tend the course.</p>
    <p>Mr Foo said: “Dur­ing Hal­loween, peo­ple are will­ing to pay good money to scare them­selves and tick­ets are of­ten sold out.</p>
    <p>“Why not in Bukit Brown ceme­tery or World War II bat­tle sites?</p>
    <p>“Adding in­for­ma­tion like the his­tory of World War II will help par­tic­i­pants in know­ing our own Sin­ga­pore his­tory as well.”</p>
    <p>He added that Sin­ga­pore­ans are fa­mil­iar with the usual tourist at­trac­tions like Chi­na­town, Kam­pong Glam, Mer­lion Park and Sen­tosa, “so to ac­tu­ally plan a tour to these places for lo­cals might not be at­trac­tive enough”.</p>
    <p>While he was de­vel­op­ing the night tour, he took a trip to the United States to join para­nor­mal in­ves­ti­ga­tors in some “ghost hunt­ing”, fa­mil­iaris­ing him­self with the var­i­ous equip­ment used.</p>
    <p>“In the US, we used an arsenal of equip­ment that in­cludes in­frared and elec­tro­mag­netic field de­tec­tors, video recorders, spirit au­dio boxes and dows­ing rods,” said Mr Foo, who also runs a business dis­tribut­ing pet sup­plies.</p>
    <p>The tour ex­plores sites such as Labrador Park and Kent Ridge Park, where World War II bat­tles and mas­sacres took place.</p>
    <p>It ends at Bukit Brown ceme­tery, be­lieved to be one of the largest Chi­nese ceme­ter­ies out­side China.</p>
    <p>Ev­ery­one on the tour is given a can­dle as well as an EMF de­tec­tor for pick­ing up para­nor­mal ac­tiv­ity.</p>
    <p>But the guided tour is not just about a scary ex­pe­ri­ence for par­tic­i­pants, as they also leave with a sense of Sin­ga­pore’s cul­ture and his­tory.</p>
    <p>For in­stance, dur­ing the visit to Bukit Brown ceme­tery, Mr Foo ex­plained that Chi­nese di­alect groups have var­i­ous tomb de­signs, and that many of those buried were re­spected mem­bers of the lo­cal com­mu­nity.</p>
    <p>At Labrador Park, par­tic­i­pants were told about the Sook Ching mas­sacre, in which many Chi­nese were ex­e­cuted by Ja­panese sol­diers dur­ing the Oc­cu­pa­tion.</p>
    <p>At Bukit Chandu, the story of war hero Lieu­tenant Adnan Saidi was re­counted. On Feb 13, 1942, he led his men to foil an am­bush against the in­vad­ing Ja­panese troops, but was even­tu­ally cap­tured and killed at the age of 27.</p>
    <p>The tour was the best-sell­ing one for the com­pany be­fore Covid-19 dis­rupted business.</p>
    <p>Tourism busi­nesses in Sin­ga­pore were per­mit­ted to re­sume oper­a­tions in stages from July 1, as part of the re­sump­tion of ac­tiv­i­ties in phase two of the cir­cuit breaker.</p>
    <p>And things are look­ing up again, with lo­cals show­ing more in­ter­est com­pared with dur­ing the pre-pan­demic pe­riod.</p>
    <p>Up to 10 peo­ple can sign up for the night tour, which costs $105 per per­son till the year end.</p>
    <p>Mr Foo said: “With de­mand and re­quests steadily build­ing up in re­cent weeks, we’re now run­ning tours at least five times a week.”</p>
    <p>The tour, which runs from Wed­nes­days to Sun­days, starts at 7.30pm and lasts three hours.</p>
