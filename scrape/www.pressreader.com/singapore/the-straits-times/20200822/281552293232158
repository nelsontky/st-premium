    <p>Sin­ga­pore will ease travel re­stric­tions on visi­tors from Brunei and New Zealand from Sept 1, in a small but sig­nif­i­cant step to­wards reviving an ail­ing Changi Air­port bat­tered by the Covid-19 pan­demic. The Re­pub­lic will also al­low peo­ple here to travel to these two coun­tries.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore will ease travel re­stric­tions on visi­tors from Brunei and New Zealand from Sept 1, in a small but sig­nif­i­cant step to­wards reviving an ail­ing Changi air hub bat­tered by the Covid-19 pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Trav­ellers who have stayed in those two coun­tries in the last con­sec­u­tive 14 days be­fore their visit to Sin­ga­pore will not have to serve a stay-home no­tice. They will be tested for the coro­n­avirus upon ar­rival at the air­port in­stead.</p>
    <p>The Re­pub­lic will also al­low peo­ple here to travel to these two coun­tries, although trav­ellers are ad­vised to check en­try re­quire­ments im­posed by the des­ti­na­tion coun­try, and take nec­es­sary pre­cau­tion­ary mea­sures.</p>
    <p>These are among the bor­der con­trol mea­sures that will be eased, the Govern­ment an­nounced yes­ter­day as it laid out plans to fur­ther re­open Sin­ga­pore’s bor­ders and econ­omy in a safe way.</p>
    <p>Visi­tors from Brunei and New Zealand will need to ap­ply for an Air Travel Pass be­tween seven and 30 days be­fore their in­tended date of ar­rival here. Ap­pli­ca­tions for the pass will start on Sept 1, which is also when stu­dents study­ing over­seas will be al­lowed to travel.</p>
    <p>In­com­ing trav­ellers from cer­tain low-risk places will serve a shorter stay-home no­tice of seven days, down from 14 days. Places in this cat­e­gory in­clude Aus­tralia (ex­clud­ing Vic­to­ria state), China, Ma­cau, Tai­wan, Viet­nam and Malaysia.</p>
    <p>Ed­u­ca­tion Min­is­ter Lawrence Wong, who co-chairs the multi-min­istry task force tack­ling the pan­demic, said the Covid-19 sit­u­a­tion around the world is still very fluid, and that Sin­ga­pore will up­date its bor­der con­trol mea­sures based on its lat­est as­sess­ment.</p>
    <p>“We know that some places have been able to con­trol the in­fec­tion ef­fec­tively, and the risk of im­por­ta­tion is low,” he said. “Our as­sess­ment is that there is no need for a stay-home no­tice re­quire­ment for trav­ellers from these low-risk places, and a Covid-19 test will be suf­fi­cient.”</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore is start­ing cau­tiously, with visi­tors from the two coun­tries, he said.</p>
    <p>Sep­a­rately, Trans­port Min­is­ter Ong Ye Kung told re­porters that Sin­ga­pore’s avi­a­tion sec­tor is closely linked to the whole econ­omy. “So we need to re­ally start to take steps to open up in a safe man­ner that can re­vive Changi Air­port, re­sus­ci­tate the avi­a­tion sec­tor,” he said.</p>
    <p>In Sin­ga­pore, re­stric­tions on ac­tiv­i­ties will also be eased. For in­stance, ex­er­cise classes con­ducted by in­struc­tors will be al­lowed to take place at more open spa­ces in SportSG sport cen­tres and Hous­ing Board ar­eas from Sept 1. The 1m safe dis­tanc­ing re­quire­ment will also be waived in spe­cific set­tings, such as on pub­lic trans­port or in lifts.</p>
    <p>But the task force also stressed the im­por­tance of stay­ing vig­i­lant to con­trol the spread of Covid-19.</p>
    <p>On this front, crowd con­trol will be beefed up at Lucky Plaza and Penin­sula Plaza – two malls that at­tract large crowds on week­ends. From Aug 29, visi­tors on week­ends with an even last digit on their iden­tity cards can visit these malls only on even dates, while those with an odd last digit can visit only on odd dates.</p>
    <p>Pro­fes­sor Leo Yee Sin, ex­ec­u­tive di­rec­tor of the National Cen­tre for In­fec­tious Dis­eases (NCID), said a bal­anced and risk-man­aged ap­proach is needed for Sin­ga­pore to pro­gres­sively re­gain con­nec­tiv­ity with other parts of the world.</p>
    <p>NCID stud­ies and analy­ses avail­able in­for­ma­tion with the Min­istry of Health to cal­i­brate ac­tion plans, she said, adding: “This is a dy­namic process and will be closely mon­i­tored and ad­justed along the way with the aim of es­tab­lish­ing a safer way to phys­i­cally con­nect with the re­gion and glob­ally.”</p>
    <p>But she added that pre­ven­tive mea­sures cur­rently in place within the lo­cal com­mu­nity must con­tinue to en­sure that com­mu­nity trans­mis­sion is con­tained.</p>
    <p>STAY­ING OPEN TO SUR­VIVE</p>
    <p>As a small, open econ­omy, to sur­vive, we have got to keep our bor­ders open. To earn a liv­ing, we have got to have con­nec­tions with the world. And to thrive, to pros­per, we must be an avi­a­tion hub.</p>
