    <p>In my youth, I was ex­per­i­men­tal with make-up, but as an adult, I set­tled – as most peo­ple do – into a pat­tern.</p>
    <p>Ev­ery­thing was an­chored around red lip­stick. I wore foun­da­tion, two dif­fer­ent con­ceal­ers, brow gel, mas­cara, blusher and a touch of high­lighter and shim­mer­ing eye­shadow ev­ery day.</p>
    <p>As a staunch fem­i­nist, I was con­fi­dent that I did all this for my­self, not any­one else’s plea­sure, so I rea­soned that work­ing from home would not change my re­la­tion­ship with make-up. It did not quite work out like that.</p>
    <p>After j ust a few days, I had aban­doned ev­ery­thing but the lip.</p>
    <p>It wasn’t that no one saw me ex­cept my near­est and dear­est. In fact, I was more vis­i­ble than ever, thanks to seem­ingly end­less Zoom calls.</p>
    <p>And it wasn’t that my skin was markedly bet­ter as a re­sult of stay­ing home. The stress and lack of sleep were caus­ing eczema, hor­monal break­outs and dark cir­cles that a rac­coon would envy.</p>
    <p>A lot of it came down to the ex­plo­sion of usual rou­tines – not least, hav­ing nowhere to go.</p>
    <p>Ap­ply­ing a full face of make-up to com­mute three steps to my desk seemed faintly ridicu­lous and, any­way, what did time even mean?</p>
    <p>An In­flu­en­ster sur­vey sug­gests that most peo­ple have changed their make-up habits due to the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Fifty-seven per cent of its more than 1,000 re­spon­dents were con­sis­tently wear­ing less make-up and 21 per cent ditched it en­tirely.</p>
    <p>“I truly didn’t touch my make-up for three months. In fact, I put them all in the fridge in the hopes of ex­tend­ing their shelf life,” says writer and dig­i­tal mar­ke­teer Faz Gaffa-Marsh.</p>
    <p>And pub­lic re­la­tions maven Diana Ong says: “I missed my make-up. I had such a sense of guilt when I looked at them – like, ‘Oh poor ba­bies. I’ve been ne­glect­ing you.’</p>
    <p>“I liked wear­ing make-up some­times for happy hour ses­sions or meet­ings over Zoom, or put on a lip­stick for no rea­son other than feel­ing like it. But the amount of make-up I used def­i­nitely went down.”</p>
    <p>Con­versely – as with 8 per cent of sur­vey re­spon­dents – make-up artist An­drea Claire in­creased her us­age of cos­met­ics while work­ing from home.</p>
    <p>“This time hasn’t af­fected my re­la­tion­ship with make-up be­cause make-up and I have al­ways been best friends,” she says.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker, she even started an In­sta­gram pro­ject called Covid Self-Por­traits in which she ex­per­i­mented with prod­ucts to show­case her skills.</p>
    <p>“Cre­ative minds need to cre­ate,” she points out. Within her cir­cles, make-up sales went up with plenty of clients reach­ing out for her beauty shop­ping lists, she adds.</p>
    <p>From a con­sumer’s point of view, the big­gest change lies in where peo­ple spend our dol­lars: on­line.</p>
    <p>Net-a-porter re­ported a huge in­crease in make-up sales for May, with the big­gest growth com­ing from foun­da­tion – sales were up 109 per cent from last year.</p>
    <p>That makes in­tu­itive sense – prepan­demic, there were not many peo­ple who would have con­fi­dently tried on foun­da­tion with­out swatch­ing it on skin. Now, they have no other op­tion.</p>
    <p>It is also hard to see how IRL (in real life) make-up re­tail will sur­vive the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>While it is both prac­ti­cal and plea­sur­able to go into a store, see how some­thing shim­mers on skin and take it home im­me­di­ately, who will risk dip­ping their fin­gers into com­mu­nal pots and pal­ettes in the fore­see­able fu­ture?</p>
    <p>To that end, as Sephora re­opened its stores, it fig­ured out smart ways to repli­cate swatch­ing with in-app ser­vices such as the aug­mented re­al­ity Vir­tual Artist, a Scan-toIn­ter­act func­tion that al­lows cus­tomers to learn more about any prod­uct and com­pli­men­tary Zoom con­sul­ta­tions.</p>
    <p>All that said, the In­flu­en­ster sur­vey sug­gests that 24 per cent of peo­ple will not be re­turn­ing to IRL shop­ping. That goes up to 30 per cent if sam­pling and swatch­ing are not al­lowed.</p>
    <p>What about whether peo­ple will go back to wear­ing make-up as they did be­fore once they have some­where to go?</p>
    <p>Ms Claire points out that after ma­jor crises, lip­stick sales typ­i­cally in­crease – a much-stud­ied eco­nomic phe­nom­e­non known as the lip­stick ef­fect.</p>
    <p>Ms Gaffa-Marsh is not sure what will hap­pen when things go back to nor­mal – what­ever that means.</p>
    <p>She does ad­mit: “When I do get my face done up like I did last week­end for a shoot, it feels like a treat.”</p>
    <p>All of which brings me back to my pout: Why did the red lip re­main while ev­ery­thing else van­ished?</p>
    <p>For me, it is a sym­bol of ev­ery­thing good that the pan­demic has brought – the chance to as­sess what peo­ple value and what they do not.</p>
    <p>I don’t care much about mas­cara or elab­o­rate eye make-up, but red lip­stick is a joy – part of my iden­tity even.</p>
    <p>This is the make-up I wear for my­self: a flour­ish and a fri­vol­ity, com­pletely un­nec­es­sary, but oh so en­joy­able. And couldn’t we all do with a bit more of that these days?</p>
