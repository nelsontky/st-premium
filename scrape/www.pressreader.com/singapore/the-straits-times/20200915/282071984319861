    <p>Feng Ming Con­struc­tion was fined $55,000 for dam­ag­ing a water main – the high­est fine im­posed by the State Courts for the of­fence – and an ad­di­tional $1,500 for unau­tho­rised sheet pil­ing in­stal­la­tion works at Dun­earn Road.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore’s water agency PUB said in a state­ment yes­ter­day that the dam­age to the water pipe, which is 50cm in di­am­e­ter, hap­pened on Sept 20 last year and dis­rupted water sup­ply to 38 house­holds in the vicin­ity.</p>
    <p>The dam­age led to the loss of about 468,000 litres of water, enough to fill one-fifth of an Olympic-sized swim­ming pool.</p>
    <p>Feng Ming was car­ry­ing out unau­tho­rised sheet pil­ing works as part of a road-widen­ing project in Bukit Timah when its pil­ing ma­chine drove a steel sheet pile into the ground and punc­tured the water main.</p>
    <p>PUB un­cov­ered a hole of about 10cm by 3cm on the water main when it went on site to iso­late the leak and re­pair the dam­age.</p>
    <p>The agency also de­ployed a water wagon and pro­vided water bags to the af­fected house­holds.</p>
    <p>PUB’s in­ves­ti­ga­tions found that Feng Ming had failed to phys­i­cally as­cer­tain the ex­act lo­ca­tion and align­ment of the water main, de­spite know­ing about the water main from the PUB water ser­vice plan.</p>
    <p>Feng Ming was fined $55,000 for dam­ag­ing the water main. This is the sec­ond time the con­struc­tion com­pany is be­ing fined for the same rea­son. It was fined $40,000 for dam­ag­ing a 30cm di­am­e­ter water main at Gey­lang Lorong 1 in Oc­to­ber 2013.</p>
    <p>Any­one who causes dam­age to PUB water mains with a di­am­e­ter of 30cm or more can be fined up to $200,000 and jailed for up to three years.</p>
    <p>The com­pany was also fined an ad­di­tional $1,500 for fail­ing to get PUB’s ap­proval be­fore car­ry­ing sheet pil­ing in­stal­la­tion works.</p>
    <p>Un­der the pub­lic util­i­ties reg­u­la­tions for the protection of water pipes in­fra­struc­ture, con­trac­tors in­stalling sheet piles must en­sure that it is ap­proved by a reg­is­tered pro­fes­sional en­gi­neer and in­clude a method state­ment, an i mpact as­sess­ment and i nstru­men­tal monitoring pro­posal. Any­one who fails to do so can be fined up to $10,000.</p>
