    <p>• Uefa pres­i­dent Alek­sander Ce­ferin says he is con­fi­dent the post­poned Euro 2020 tour­na­ment will go ahead next year de­spite a fresh wave of Covid-19 cases across Europe, though it could be staged in fewer than the planned 12 coun­tries if nec­es­sary.</p>
    <p>The 24-team event was pushed back by a year due to the pan­demic, but a new surge of in­fec­tions has raised doubts over whether it can be played in the resched­uled June-July 2021 slot.</p>
    <p>“We are al­ways con­cerned about the sit­u­a­tion (but) we are ab­so­lutely sure that the Euro will be played,” Ce­ferin told the Span­ish pay TV net­work Mo­vis­tar Plus.</p>
    <p>“The plan is that we do the Euro ex­actly as it is. But I have to say that, in­stead of 12 coun­tries, we could do a Euro in­stead in 11, in eight, in five or in one coun­try.”</p>
    <p>He added that it was too soon to say whether matches would be played with­out spec­ta­tors, in full sta­di­ums or with re­duced ca­pac­i­ties.</p>
    <p>He also said he liked the idea of fin­ish­ing the Cham­pi­ons League with a week-long “fi­nal four” tour­na­ment and it was some­thing to be con­sid­ered for the next com­pe­ti­tion cy­cle, start­ing with the 2024-25 sea­son.</p>
    <p>Last sea­son’s com­pe­ti­tion fin­ished with a “fi­nal eight” tour­na­ment with matches from the quar­ter-fi­nal on­wards played over two weeks in Lis­bon in a sin­gle-game knock­out for­mat.</p>
    <p>It was ini­tially in­tended as a one­off re­sponse to the Covid-19 pan­demic, which halted play for sev­eral months.</p>
    <p>“The sys­tem last year was an in­ter­est­ing sys­tem and the feed­back from the clubs that par­tic­i­pated was that they were very happy with it,” he said. “A fi­nal eight is prob­a­bly very hard to do cal­en­dar-wise, but for me... a fi­nal four, a week of foot­ball, might be a great event.”</p>
