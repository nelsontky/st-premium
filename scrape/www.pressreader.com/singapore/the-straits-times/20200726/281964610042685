    <p>NEW YORK • On a Fri­day evening late last month, three women in match­ing blue-and-white run­ning shoes leaned over a start­ing line at Buf­falo Park in Ari­zona, each with one hand on their watches.</p>
    <p>Af­ter a count­down and a yell of “go”, they bolted across the line. It was just like any other cross-coun­try race – ex­cept their com­pe­ti­tion was in­vis­i­ble: A trio of ri­val run­ners raced them in a nearby state as thou­sands of fans watched on a splitscree­n live In­sta­gram video feed.</p>
    <p>Vir­tual races were not sup­posed to be the most ex­cit­ing com­pe­ti­tion for run­ners this sum­mer.</p>
    <p>But, with the coro­n­avirus pan­demic mak­ing large-scale gath­er­ings im­pos­si­ble, run­ners are turn­ing to tech­nol­ogy as they search for ways to train, stay con­nected with team­mates and com­pete.</p>
    <p>Some have kept it sim­ple, log­ging work­outs and train­ing plans i n share­able Google doc­u­ments or spread­sheets to stay in touch with their coaches. Oth­ers are us­ing so­cial fit­ness apps like MapMyRun and Strava, which saw a record 3.4 mil­lion down­loads in May.</p>
    <p>And some coaches and race or­gan­is­ers have in­no­vated af­ter be­ing forced to scrap plans for pres­ti­gious meets, mas­sive marathons and the Tokyo Olympics, which were de­layed to 2021.</p>
    <p>They are mak­ing the best of a time with­out in-per­son com­pe­ti­tion by host­ing vir­tual races and pit­ting run­ners in dif­fer­ent states against each other.</p>
    <p>“Every­thing’s pretty much been wiped off the ta­ble and we’ve had to re­group and re­assess and find things to look for­ward to that aren’t tra­di­tional,” said Ben Rosario, the head coach of the Hoka North­ern Ari­zona Elite pro­fes­sional dis­tance run­ning team.</p>
    <p>While Ari­zona was un­der a stayat-home or­der in April and May, his small team went more than a month with­out train­ing to­gether, and he used an on­line train­ing log to send work­out plans and stay con­nected with his ath­letes.</p>
    <p>But that did not re­place the thrill of racing. So when the team’s run­ners were able to train to­gether again, Rosario hatched a plan.</p>
    <p>He part­nered another pro­fes­sional team in Boul­der, Colorado, to host a time trial. The teams would run a 3.2km course, start­ing at the same time, and com­pare re­sults.</p>
    <p>As an added twist, both squads would livestream the race on In­sta­gram on a split screen, so fans could watch from home.</p>
    <p>When Stephanie Bruce ar­rived at Buf­falo Park, she felt pre-race nerves that she had not ex­pe­ri­enced in months.</p>
    <p>“I kind of got those but­ter­flies, which was re­ally nice to have,” said Bruce of Hoka North­ern Ari­zona.</p>
    <p>“When we haven’t had the op­por­tu­nity to race, it’s re­ally hard. You’re in this cage where you just want to let out all the fit­ness and all the work­outs that you’ve been pour­ing all of your heart into.”</p>
    <p>Bruce, the first wo­man to fin­ish for ei­ther team, said it was dif­fi­cult to imag­ine racing the Boul­der run­ners while run­ning the course.</p>
    <p>But fans en­joyed the com­pe­ti­tion – more than 15,000 peo­ple watched the videos af­ter they were posted on In­sta­gram.</p>
    <p>Even for or­di­nary ath­letes, run­ning with friends and com­pet­ing in races was a steady, fa­mil­iar part of life that was ripped away – and they are look­ing for ways to re­con­nect.</p>
    <p>Many of them are us­ing Strava, an app that al­lows run­ners to in­ter­act with each other by giv­ing “ku­dos” on a friend’s work­out. They can also com­pare times and join clubs and chal­lenges.</p>
    <p>Fac­ing the pos­si­bil­ity of no in-per­son races, or­gan­is­ers are also us­ing tech­nol­ogy to mo­ti­vate run­ners. Last month, the New York Road Run­ners (NYRR), host of the can­celled New York City Marathon, moved a ver­sion of it on­line.</p>
    <p>In Oc­to­ber, en­trants will have a two-week win­dow to run the 42.195km on their own and log the re­sult on Strava as tracked by their phone or GPS watch. Times will be com­piled on an NYRR leader­board.</p>
    <p>Chris­tine Burke, se­nior vice-pres­i­dent for NYRR, ac­knowl­edged that the vir­tual races can­not recre­ate the strat­egy and tac­tics that come with an in-per­son com­pe­ti­tion.</p>
    <p>Nor can they ad­just for dif­fer­ent el­e­va­tions, weather con­di­tions or even GPS mal­func­tions around the world. Still, she said, run­ners have em­braced the con­cept.</p>
    <p>Other groups are cre­at­ing mu­sic playlists on­line and dig­i­tal racing bibs that run­ners can wear dur­ing their vir­tual races, ac­cord­ing to Haku, an event man­age­ment plat­form that part­ners race or­gan­is­ers.</p>
    <p>“We’re cre­at­ing a new kind of bucket of run­ners, be­cause you have this whole group of peo­ple who are into well­ness and into fit­ness... but they can’t go to their group fit­ness class,” said Haku’s co­founder, Jackie Levi.</p>
    <p>NYRR has seen an in­crease in par­tic­i­pants in its vir­tual races this year. It had about 22,000 fin­ish­ers in its two vir­tual events this year, up from about 15,000 last year.</p>
    <p>The or­gan­i­sa­tion also re­cently added two new vir­tual events, each hav­ing more than 10,000 fin­ish­ers.</p>
    <p>But vir­tual racing can tide the pros over only for so long. Bruce, the Hoka elite run­ner, is itch­ing to toe a real start­ing line again.</p>
    <p>“You’re miss­ing the con­nec­tion,” she said. “I think hu­man con­nec­tion is what keeps a lot of peo­ple mo­ti­vated and in­spired in life.”</p>
