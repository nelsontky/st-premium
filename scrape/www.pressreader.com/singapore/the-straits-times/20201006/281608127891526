    <p>There can be more eas­ing of pan­demic con­trol mea­sures, in­clud­ing the limit of five peo­ple for so­cial gath­er­ings, if ev­ery­one con­tin­ues to work to­gether and keep their guard up, Health Min­is­ter Gan Kim Yong said in Par­lia­ment yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Let­ting larger groups gather would al­low big­ger fam­i­lies or groups of friends to meet and have meals to­gether, he said in re­sponse to ques­tions from sev­eral MPs on the loos­en­ing of Covid-19 rules here.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore has grad­u­ally eased some of its pan­demic con­trol mea­sures over the past few months, lead­ing some to ques­tion when the cap of five peo­ple for so­cial ac­tiv­i­ties – es­pe­cially when eat­ing out to­gether – would be lifted.</p>
    <p>Mr Gan said yes­ter­day: “We are par­tic­u­larly con­cerned about din­ing, as we need to re­move our masks so as to eat and drink, but we tend to also talk at the same time. The risk is con­sid­er­ably higher than ac­tiv­i­ties for which we can keep our masks on and main­tain a safe dis­tance.”</p>
    <p>He pointed out that Sin­ga­pore has al­ready made big steps to­wards restor­ing eco­nomic and so­cial ac­tiv­i­ties – in a safe man­ner.</p>
    <p>For in­stance, from Sept 28, more em­ploy­ees who have been work­ing from home were al­lowed to re­turn to their work­places.</p>
    <p>But in or­der to keep work­places safe and min­imise crowd­ing, such em­ploy­ees are to con­tinue to work from home for at least half their work­ing time, with no more than 50 per cent of such em­ploy­ees at the work­place at any point in time.</p>
    <p>Work-re­lated events, in­clud­ing con­fer­ences, sem­i­nars and meet­ings, have also been al­lowed to re­sume with a 50-per­son limit to re­duce the risk of trans­mis­sion.</p>
    <p>The au­thor­i­ties have also taken steps to sup­port the re­sump­tion of a few very tar­geted and spe­cific ar­eas, said Mr Gan.</p>
    <p>These in­clude the in­crease in group size lim­its for key life events such as wed­dings and re­li­gious ac­tiv­i­ties to 100 peo­ple, but in mul­ti­ple zones or time slots of at most 50 peo­ple each, to limit po­ten­tial</p>
    <p>risk ex­po­sure.</p>
    <p>The Gov­ern­ment had also ear­lier al­lowed the re­sump­tion of phys­i­cal ex­er­cise classes in com­mon com­mu­nity spa­ces, and an in­crease in ca­pac­ity for cin­e­mas and leisure at­trac­tions such as the Sin­ga­pore Zoo and Jurong Bird Park.</p>
    <p>Mu­se­ums and li­braries have also re­opened, and small-scale live per­for­mances are be­ing tri­alled to pre­pare Sin­ga­pore to even­tu­ally be able to re­sume such ac­tiv­i­ties safely, said Mr Gan.</p>
    <p>He added that the au­thor­i­ties here are be­ing care­ful in re­open­ing Sin­ga­pore, as they have learnt from the ex­pe­ri­ences of other coun­tries.</p>
    <p>“When re­stric­tions are lifted pre­ma­turely, or too hastily, a resur­gence of cases may oc­cur, re­sult­ing in par­tial reim­po­si­tion of re­stric­tions. On the other hand, it is not sus­tain­able to main­tain tight re­stric­tions for a pro­longed pe­riod, which will se­verely im­pact our econ­omy and our lives,” he said.</p>
    <p>So the Gov­ern­ment has taken a care­fully cal­i­brated ap­proach in mov­ing to­wards phase three, and will share more de­tails in the com­ing weeks.</p>
    <p>Min­is­ter for Education Lawrence Wong also said ear­lier yes­ter­day that his min­istry is study­ing how to re­sume more ac­tiv­i­ties, and will share more de­tails when ready.</p>
    <p>But Mr Gan cau­tioned: “The low num­ber of com­mu­nity cases cur­rently is not ac­ci­den­tal but has come about due to our col­lec­tive hard work and sac­ri­fices. Even as we move to­wards phase three, the new nor­mal will be dif­fer­ent from what we were used to in the pre-Covid days.”</p>
    <p>He added: “As overseas travel re­stric­tions are pro­gres­sively eased and more ac­tiv­i­ties re­sume, it has be­come even more crit­i­cal that each of us plays our part to ex­er­cise so­cial re­spon­si­bil­ity and ad­here to the safe man­age­ment mea­sures, in or­der to keep our fam­ily and friends safe.”</p>
