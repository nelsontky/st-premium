    <p>MINSK • Be­larus said yes­ter­day it was in­tro­duc­ing counter-sanc­tions on the Euro­pean Union af­ter the bloc adopted mea­sures against mem­bers of the regime in Minsk fol­low­ing Pres­i­dent Alexan­der Lukashenko’s dis­puted re-elec­tion.</p>
    <p>“In con­nec­tion with visa sanc­tions adopted by the EU against a num­ber of Be­laru­sian of­fi­cials, the Be­laru­sian side from to­day is in­tro­duc­ing a list of re­cip­ro­cal sanc­tions,” Be­larus’ For­eign Min­istry said in a state­ment.</p>
    <p>EU lead­ers ear­lier yes­ter­day gave their ap­proval for travel bans and as­set freezes on some 40 mem­bers of Mr Lukashenko’s regime they deemed re­spon­si­ble for rig­ging the Aug 9 elec­tion and the sub­se­quent vi­o­lent crack­down on protests.</p>
    <p>Un­like Bri­tain and Canada, which have al­ready sanc­tioned Be­laru­sian of­fi­cials, the EU will not be im­pos­ing mea­sures on Mr Lukashenko him­self.</p>
    <p>By im­pos­ing sanc­tions “the EU has alien­ated” the coun­try, Be­larus’ For­eign Min­istry said, in de­nounc­ing the 27-coun­try bloc’s move as a “puni­tive mea­sure”.</p>
    <p>Minsk said it would not dis­close which Euro­pean of­fi­cials were be­ing tar­geted in its counter-sanc­tions, and threat­ened “even more se­ri­ous con­se­quences” if the EU ex­pands its re­stric­tions.</p>
    <p>Be­larus ally Rus­sia crit­i­cised the EU penalties, de­scrib­ing the move as a sign of po­lit­i­cal weak­ness.</p>
    <p>“In gen­eral we are very, very neg­a­tive about the sanc­tions pol­icy... this is more a man­i­fes­ta­tion of weak­ness than strength,” said Krem­lin spokesman Dmitry Peskov.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, Rus­sian Pres­i­dent Vladimir Putin and Mr Lukashenko “con­firmed their mu­tual in­cli­na­tion to strengthen the al­liance be­tween Rus­sia and Be­larus” dur­ing a phone call, the Krem­lin press ser­vice said.</p>
    <p>Mr Putin has long called for full uni­fi­ca­tion of Be­larus and Rus­sia, while Mr Lukashenko has so far ruled this out.</p>
    <p>The lead­ers also dis­cussed the post-elec­tion sit­u­a­tion in Be­larus and ex­pressed con­fi­dence that the “prob­lems will be solved soon”, the Krem­lin said.</p>
    <p>Protesters have taken to the streets of Be­laru­sian cities since Mr Lukashenko claimed a sixth term with 80 per cent of the vote. Riot po­lice have de­tained thou­sands of protesters, many of whom re­ported tor­ture and abuse in cus­tody, prompt­ing in­ter­na­tional con­dem­na­tion.</p>
    <p>The EU had promised sanc­tions since Au­gust, but ap­proval was held up by Cyprus, which re­fused to give its back­ing un­til the bloc took more ac­tion against Turkey for drilling for gas in its ter­ri­to­rial wa­ters.</p>
    <p>The dead­lock was fi­nally bro­ken early yes­ter­day, with the 27 lead­ers agree­ing to a for­mal state­ment threat­en­ing Turkey with sanc­tions if it does not halt its ac­tiv­i­ties.</p>
