    <p>To bet­ter pro­tect work­ers from in­fec­tious dis­eases and work­place ac­ci­dents, the Min­istry of Man­power (MOM) will work closely with em­ploy­ers and build­ing own­ers on man­ag­ing risks and stay­ing vig­i­lant.</p>
    <p>Work­ers will also get bet­ter men­tal health sup­port, with a free on­line as­sess­ment tool called iWorkHealt­h to be launched early next year to help em­ploy­ers iden­tify sources of work stress, said Se­nior Min­is­ter of State for Man­power and De­fence Zaqy Mo­hamad yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>These were rec­om­men­da­tions by the In­ter­na­tional Ad­vi­sory Panel for Work­place Safety and Health (WSH) for a post-Covid-19 world and have been ac­cepted by the Gov­ern­ment, he added.</p>
    <p>Speak­ing at the clos­ing of the two-day vir­tual Sin­ga­pore WSH Con­fer­ence, he noted that as the pan­demic changes the way busi­nesses op­er­ate, with more peo­ple work­ing from home, work­place safety and health must also be ad­justed to ad­dress new con­cerns.</p>
    <p>Given the risk of a fu­ture “dis­ease X” that may be more in­fec­tious and lethal than Covid-19, the panel sug­gested that the min­istry build on its ex­pe­ri­ence work­ing with public health au­thor­i­ties, through the multi-min­istry task force, to in­te­grate in­fec­tious dis­ease man­age­ment in the work­place.</p>
    <p>To achieve this, the Gov­ern­ment will work closely with em­ploy­ers and build­ing own­ers to de­velop guide­lines, such as shar­ing in­for­ma­tion on hot spots, for more tar­geted risk iden­ti­fi­ca­tion and in­ter­ven­tions, said Mr Zaqy.</p>
    <p>The panel also rec­om­mended greater men­tal health sup­port at work, with com­pa­nies en­cour­aged to in­cor­po­rate men­tal well-be­ing as part of their risk as­sess­ment and man­age­ment frame­works.</p>
    <p>Panel mem­ber Wik­ing Hus­berg, an in­ter­na­tional con­sul­tant on oc­cu­pa­tional safety and health, said men­tal health is i mpor­tant to work­ers’ and firms’ pro­duc­tiv­ity, but is a dif­fi­cult area to leg­is­late.</p>
    <p>“Sin­ga­pore ought to fo­cus on pro­mot­ing greater aware­ness and cre­at­ing a sup­port­ive work or­gan­i­sa­tion and en­vi­ron­ment that is con­ducive to­wards em­ploy­ees’ men­tal well-be­ing,” added Mr Hus­berg.</p>
    <p>On Tues­day, a tri­par­tite ad­vi­sory for men­tal well-be­ing at work was is­sued on how com­pa­nies can sup­port their work­ers’ men­tal health.</p>
    <p>The panel also urged MOM to con­tinue to main­tain vig­i­lance in pre­vent­ing work­place ac­ci­dents, even as com­pa­nies man­age new risks aris­ing from Covid-19.</p>
    <p>In par­tic­u­lar, MOM should con­duct deeper in­ves­ti­ga­tions into the top con­trib­u­tor of ma­jor in­juries – slips, trips and falls – to un­der­stand the root causes of this grow­ing prob­lem. The first half of this year saw 16 work­place fa­tal­i­ties, 201 ma­jor in­juries and 4,779 mi­nor in­juries. Most in­juries were caused by slips, trips and falls.</p>
    <p>There were 17 fa­tal­i­ties, 319 ma­jor in­juries and 6,294 mi­nor in­juries in the same pe­riod last year.</p>
    <p>One rea­son why in­juries con­tin­ued to hap­pen, even dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker pe­riod and de­spite the re­duc­tion in busi­ness ac­tiv­ity, could be that com­pa­nies and em­ploy­ees were pre­oc­cu­pied with im­ple­ment­ing Covid-19 mea­sures and over­looked the fun­da­men­tals of WSH, said Mr Zaqy.</p>
    <p>To help com­bat this, the panel called for an ap­proved code of prac­tice to ed­u­cate and engage com­pany di­rec­tors on their re­spon­si­bil­i­ties and ways to en­sure WSH risks are ef­fec­tively man­aged.</p>
    <p>Work­ers are also urged to co­op­er­ate and play their part in man­ag­ing work­place risks, said Mr Zaqy.</p>
    <p>Com­pa­nies can tap tech­nol­ogy such as vir­tual and aug­mented re­al­ity to man­age both ac­ci­dent and Covid-19 risks, with­out the need for more money or man­power, he added.</p>
    <p>Bosses should take the lead in talk­ing about men­tal health in the work­place, as they can cre­ate greater aware­ness and shape dis­cus­sions in a pos­i­tive man­ner, said Work­place Safety and Health (WSH) Coun­cil chair­man John Ng.</p>
    <p>Mr Ng, who was speak­ing dur­ing a panel dis­cus­sion with tri­par­tite lead­ers at the Sin­ga­pore WSH Con­fer­ence yes­ter­day, said: “When we speak, our staff, our peo­ple, lis­ten. So when the con­ver­sa­tion con­tin­ues, the pos­i­tive lan­guage we use, and the en­cour­age­ment that we put in place for us to talk about men­tal health, will very soon cas­cade down to var­i­ous lev­els of lead­er­ship.</p>
    <p>“To me, it is about lis­ten­ing to them, know­ing what to say to them, know­ing what not to say to them. And also, when they need help, help must be avail­able to them.”</p>
    <p>Man­agers, too, should be trained to spot signs and symp­toms as­so­ci­ated with men­tal health is­sues, he said.</p>
    <p>On Tues­day, the Min­istry of Man­power, the Na­tional Trades Union Congress (NTUC) and Sin­ga­pore Na­tional Em­ploy­ers Fed­er­a­tion (SNEF) re­leased a tri­par­tite ad­vi­sory pro­vid­ing guid­ance and re­sources on men­tal well­ness.</p>
    <p>The ad­vi­sory called on com­pa­nies to recog­nise the need for staff to have ad­e­quate rest out­side of work hours, by es­tab­lish­ing a work-life har­mony pol­icy of­fer­ing clar­ity on after-hours work com­mu­ni­ca­tion.</p>
    <p>Mr Ng said the ad­vi­sory was timely, and the WSH Coun­cil will be ramp­ing up dis­cus­sions on men­tal health at the work­place.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, NTUC as­sis­tant sec­re­tary-gen­eral Melvin Yong, who was also part of the panel at the vir­tual con­fer­ence, said tri­par­tism will need to be “even tighter” as the world is evolv­ing rapidly and the na­ture of work is changing.</p>
    <p>The fu­ture work­place will be one that is smarter, more man­pow­er­lean and more con­nected, he said.</p>
    <p>For ex­am­ple, ar­ti­fi­cial in­tel­li­gence will even­tu­ally lead to mun­dane jobs be­ing phased out, while im­prove­ments in con­nec­tiv­ity such as 5G net­works will in­crease the pos­si­bil­i­ties for re­mote work­ing, he added.</p>
    <p>SNEF vice-pres­i­dent Dou­glas Foo, who was also on the panel, said that while Sin­ga­pore is go­ing through a chal­leng­ing pe­riod, tri­par­tism has given the na­tion a leg-up, with the lat­est ad­vi­sory com­ing in help­ful for many en­ter­prises in man­ag­ing men­tal health at the work­place.</p>
