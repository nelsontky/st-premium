    <p>It was re­ported that Sin­ga­pore­ans will be given $320 mil­lion in “tourism cred­its” to spend do­mes­ti­cally (Sin­ga­pore­ans to get $320m in tourism vouch­ers to boost sec­tor, Aug 18).</p>
    <p>But this is go­ing to be dif­fi­cult, given the way some ma­jor at­trac­tions are im­ple­ment­ing vis­i­tor caps at their premises.</p>
    <p>Last Fri­day, my fam­ily went to Jurong Bird Park and timed our walk­a­bout in the park to reach the am­phithe­atre be­fore the show started at 3pm. To most vis­i­tors, the bird show is the high­light of any visit to Jurong Bird Park.</p>
    <p>We ar­rived at 2.54pm but were told by staff that the am­phithe­atre was al­ready full. We pointed out that it was mostly empty but were then told that there was a max­i­mum 50-vis­i­tor limit. I was taken aback that only 50 peo­ple would be al­lowed in such a large, open-air space.</p>
    <p>I can un­der­stand the 50-per­son limit at rel­a­tively small in­door places, es­pe­cially if there is min­gling among the peo­ple present, such as places of wor­ship.</p>
    <p>In fact, some places of wor­ship al­ready al­low 100 peo­ple for ser­vices.</p>
    <p>At su­per­mar­kets and wet mar­kets, peo­ple move about all the time, and the chances of close con­tact with one an­other are much higher, yet the crowd con­trol and re­stric­tions are much more re­laxed.</p>
    <p>I can­not un­der­stand the ir­ra­tional de­ci­sion to limit to 50 the num­ber of peo­ple al­lowed in that large am­phithe­atre, which is open air, where peo­ple wear face masks and re­main seated to watch a show, and not min­gle. Plus, seats were also marked out to en­sure safe dis­tanc­ing.</p>
    <p>Of­fi­cials re­spon­si­ble should make such de­ci­sions on a ra­tio­nal ba­sis.</p>
