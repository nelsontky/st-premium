    <p>SEOUL • South Korea’s coro­n­avirus in­fec­tions are back “in full swing” and spread­ing na­tion­wide after mem­bers of a church at­tended a po­lit­i­cal demon­stra­tion, the author­i­ties have said, threat­en­ing one of the world’s Covid-19 suc­cess sto­ries.</p>
    <p>The Korea Cen­tres for Disease Con­trol and Preven­tion (KCDC) re­ported 288 new cases as of mid­night on Wed­nes­day, mark­ing a week of triple-digit daily in­creases, al­though down slightly from the pre­vi­ous day’s 297.</p>
    <p>“This is a grave sit­u­a­tion that could pos­si­bly lead to a na­tion­wide pan­demic,” Vice-Health Min­is­ter Kim Gang-lip told a brief­ing.</p>
    <p>With­out ag­gres­sive con­tact trac­ing, the coun­try could ex­pe­ri­ence the types of spikes and con­tin­ued in­fec­tions wit­nessed in the United States and Europe, said KCDC deputy di­rec­tor Kwon Jun-wook.</p>
    <p>“Con­sider the Covid-19 pan­demic now to be in full swing,” he said.</p>
    <p>South Korea was one of the first coun­tries out­side China to see an ex­plo­sive spread of the coro­n­avirus, but in­ten­sive trac­ing and test­ing had brought in­fec­tions un­der con­trol and quelled a sub­se­quent se­ries of spikes.</p>
    <p>The lat­est out­break is driven by hun­dreds of in­fec­tions among mem­bers of a church run by a far­right preacher. They had at­tended an anti-gov­ern­ment protest in Seoul last Satur­day, the 75th an­niver­sary of Ja­pan’s World War II sur­ren­der and the end of colo­nial rule in South Korea.</p>
    <p>Mr Kwon urged all the demon­stra­tors to be tested im­me­di­ately at nearby pub­lic health clin­ics so as to pro­tect those around them who are vul­ner­a­ble.</p>
    <p>The demon­stra­tion may have been a “cat­a­lyst” for the na­tion­wide out­break, as church­go­ers char­tered buses to the cap­i­tal from their homes across the coun­try, in­clud­ing the south­ern port of Bu­san, Mr Kwon said.</p>
    <p>South Korea has re­ported 16,346 coro­n­avirus cases, with 307 deaths.</p>
    <p>The author­i­ties say that if in­fec­tions con­tinue ris­ing at the cur­rent rate or ac­cel­er­ate, they will likely im­pose the strictest level of so­cial dis­tanc­ing – clos­ing schools, re­quir­ing em­ploy­ees to work from home and lim­it­ing gath­er­ings to 10 peo­ple.</p>
    <p>“Please do not make phys­i­cal con­tact. Ex­change nods in­stead of hand­shakes,” Mr Kwon said. “Re­frain from phys­i­cal con­tact such as hug­ging.”</p>
    <p>At least 53 of the new in­fec­tions are linked to the Sarang Jeil Church, bring­ing the group’s to­tal to 676.</p>
    <p>Hun­dreds more church mem­bers are be­ing traced for test­ing.</p>
    <p>In­fec­tion cases from the Seoul rally and one on Aug 8 in­clude peo­ple from nine cities and prov­inces. The health author­i­ties said epi­demi­o­log­i­cal work is un­der way in 150 fa­cil­i­ties, in­clud­ing the work­places of in­fected church mem­bers.</p>
    <p>Sixty in­fec­tions, in­clud­ing 33 from the church, have been linked to the anti-gov­ern­ment ral­lies in Seoul, which drew thou­sands of peo­ple. At least 8,500 demon­stra­tors had been tested as of yes­ter­day, Mr Kwon said.</p>
    <p>The gov­ern­ment has banned in­per­son church meet­ings in the greater Seoul area – an ur­ban sprawl of 25 mil­lion peo­ple – and closed other high-risk lo­ca­tions, in­clud­ing night­clubs, karaoke bars, buf­fets and cyber cafes.</p>
    <p>The Seoul gov­ern­ment has re­stricted ral­lies in the cap­i­tal to fewer than 10 peo­ple for the rest of this month.</p>
