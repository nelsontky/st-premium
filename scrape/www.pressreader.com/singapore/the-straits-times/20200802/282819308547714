    <p>The dan­ger of hav­ing bi­cy­cles on foot­paths is com­pa­ra­ble to that of e-scoot­ers, ar­gued some Straits Times Face­book users, and their com­ments grew louder on that front after an e-scooter rider re­cently could not afford to pay dam­ages to a pedes­trian left with se­vere brain in­juries.</p>
    <p>“Cy­clists are al­lowed to share path with pedes­tri­ans. Po­ten­tial (for) sim­i­lar cases to hap­pen,” said Heli Hob Poh, with Eric Chan say­ing that it causes “much anx­i­ety to pedes­tri­ans like me”.</p>
    <p>The rider had caused the mother of three to suf­fer se­vere brain in­juries after he col­lided into her in Pasir Ris while rid­ing his e-scooter in 2016. She is still un­able to speak, read or write, and needs help with ac­tiv­i­ties such as dress­ing, us­ing the toi­let and eat­ing.</p>
    <p>He has been or­dered to pay her dam­ages of more than $445,000, but his lawyer said he can­not afford to do so.</p>
    <p>ST Face­book user Ben Tan com­mented: “No in­sur­ance. What do you ex­pect. Same thing for bi­cy­cles. With more peo­ple de­liv­er­ing food by bi­cy­cle, ac­ci­dents like this will surely hap­pen again.”</p>
    <p>The ban on e-scoot­ers and all other mo­torised personal mo­bil­ity de­vices (PMDs) from foot­paths has shifted the bat­tle­ground, with bikes now in the fir­ing line of some ST Face­book users.</p>
    <p>Peo­ple can ride bikes on foot­paths, cy­cling paths and roads as long as they ob­serve the rules and speed lim­its.</p>
    <p>Tony Wee wrote: “The delivery guys are no more rid­ing PMDs. They have changed to bi­cy­cles. That also poses a dan­ger to pedes­tri­ans as they share the same foot­paths. They are al­ways in a hurry and a dan­ger to oth­ers.”</p>
    <p>Other read­ers waved the you-are-kick­ing-the-rice-bowl-ofessen­tial-work­ers card, and told peo­ple to quit bash­ing the use of e-scoot­ers and bikes.</p>
    <p>An­ge­line Toh said: “Ev­ery­thing ban, never think of the food delivery peo­ple’s rice bowl.”</p>
    <p>Weigh­ing ru­ined lives against ru­ined liveli­hoods, John Lim wrote: “Peo­ple who op­er­ate ve­hi­cles on the pedes­trian path­way, don’t com­plain why you’re banned from do­ing so. The po­ten­tial pain and suf­fer­ing that you can cause to oth­ers are too high a price to pay.</p>
    <p>“Some, un­for­tu­nately, are pay­ing it for the rest of their lives.”</p>
    <p>PO­TEN­TIALLY THOU­SANDS MORE BIKES ON FOOT­PATHS</p>
    <p>ST Face­book user Andy Wee raised the spec­tre of thou­sands more rental bikes “back on the foot­paths soon”.</p>
    <p>The shared bike pop­u­la­tion in Sin­ga­pore will be ex­pand­ing after bi­cy­cle-shar­ing firm Anywheel re­ceived ap­proval from the Land Trans­port Au­thor­ity to ex­pand its fleet from 10,000 to 15,000 with effect from last month. Start-up SG Bike has a li­cence to op­er­ate 25,000 bikes.</p>
    <p>Jimmy Hor said: “Please ban cy­cling on the pave­ments as well. They never obey the 10kmh speed limit and are se­ri­ously en­dan­ger­ing the el­derly and chil­dren walk­ing on the path.”</p>
    <p>Dar­ren Duer­den said: “Jimmy, to­tally agree. I moved here from Eng­land where cy­cling on the pave­ments is con­doned. I’ve been a mo­torist and cy­clist for a long time and if SG banned cy­clists from pave­ments, the mo­torist would re­ally need to take more care to get along with cy­clists on the road.</p>
    <p>“I ride on the roads here be­cause pave­ments are for peo­ple.”</p>
    <p>‘PUN­ISH PEDES­TRI­ANS’</p>
    <p>Some ST Face­book read­ers think pedes­tri­ans are the prob­lem.</p>
    <p>John Han asked if we can “ban peo­ple from hold­ing phones while walk­ing”. He said: “I was cy­cling on the cy­cling shared path and this pedes­trian cut abruptly into my lane. He was wear­ing ear­pieces and en­grossed with his drama. This kind of pedes­trian cre­ates dan­ger for cy­clists.”</p>
    <p>Fir­man Mohd agreed: “As some­one who used to cy­cle but gave up, I can clearly say that there are lots of pedes­tri­ans who ac­tu­ally use the phone while on ear­pieces un­til they can’t hear us cy­clists ring­ing our bi­cy­cle siren or bell.</p>
    <p>“They should be pun­ished as well.”</p>
    <p>Tak­ing a step back from the blame game, Roy Ding out­lined a way for­ward: “The first so­lu­tion has to be sep­a­rat­ing pedes­tri­ans from de­vice users. That way, pedes­tri­ans can feel safe, and you can more or less elim­i­nate the pedes­trian part of the griev­ances.</p>
    <p>“Then, sim­plify the ar­gu­ment to how best to work out the rules amongst de­vice users and de­vice safety ad­vo­cates. It will be much eas­ier to get a con­sen­sus when pedes­trian safety is more or less out of the way.”</p>

        <p data-role="text">Peo&#xAD;ple can ride bi&#xAD;cy&#xAD;cles on foot&#xAD;paths, cy&#xAD;cling paths and roads as long as they ob&#xAD;serve the rules and speed lim&#xAD;its. While some read&#xAD;ers high&#xAD;lighted the dan&#xAD;gers of hav&#xAD;ing bi&#xAD;cy&#xAD;cles on foot&#xAD;paths, oth&#xAD;ers said a ban could af&#xAD;fect liveli&#xAD;hoods.</p>
