    <p>The Sin­ga­pore Golf As­so­ci­a­tion (SGA) has wel­comed news that Kep­pel Club has been of­fered the op­por­tu­nity to op­er­ate Sin­ga­pore Is­land Coun­try Club’s (SICC) Sime Course as a hy­brid mem­bers-pub­lic fa­cil­ity.</p>
    <p>This po­ten­tial move, which is be­ing ne­go­ti­ated be­tween both clubs, is im­por­tant to en­sure the game re­mains ac­ces­si­ble to the masses and also de­velop a pipe­line of bud­ding tal­ent, noted SGA gen­eral man­ager Jerome Ng.</p>
    <p>The 31-year-old, a for­mer na­tional golfer, said: “Youth devel­op­ment has been one of the key fo­cuses of SGA and we will con­tinue to do so... The sup­port of golf clubs is an es­sen­tial part of our ju­nior devel­op­ment and high per­for­mance ef­forts to nur­ture and de­velop our na­tional golfers.”</p>
    <p>He high­lighted the Repub­lic’s re­cent suc­cess at the SEA Games. James Leow ended the coun­try’s 30-year wait by win­ning the men’s sin­gles gold at last year’s edi­tion in the Philip­pines while the men’s team also ended a long drought with vic­tory i n the 2017 Kuala Lumpur Games.</p>
    <p>How­ever, con­cerns that the game is be­ing de­pri­ori­tised re­main within the lo­cal com­mu­nity.</p>
    <p>In 2014, Sin­ga­pore had 17 golf cour­ses – 14 pri­vate and three pub­lic – which took up about 1,500 hectares of land, about two per cent of the coun­try’s to­tal land area. The ma­jor­ity of these are lo­cated on 30-year lease­hold land.</p>
    <p>That year, the Gov­ern­ment an­nounced it would not re­new the lease to Kep­pel (2021) and Ma­rina Bay Golf Course (2024). It later ac­quired the land that both Raf­fles Coun­try Club and Jurong Coun­try Club oc­cu­pied for the Kuala Lumpur-Sin­ga­pore High Speed Rail (HSR) pro­ject.</p>
    <p>Yet the sport re­tains a strong fol­low­ing. A Sin­ga­pore Golf In­dus­try Re­port in 2018 noted there were about 80,000 golfers (club mem­bers and so­cial play­ers) here.</p>
    <p>Ma­rina Bay Golf Course, the coun­try’s only pub­lic 18-hole course, is op­er­ated by NCI Golf, a sub­sidiary of the Na­tional Trades Union Congress (NTUC). It had been ex­pected to take over the Sime Course and en­sure con­tin­ued pub­lic ac­cess to golf fa­cil­i­ties but pulled out due to the high costs.</p>
    <p>NTUC Club said the pro­posal to run the Lornie Road fa­cil­ity for nine years from Jan­uary 2022 to De­cem­ber 2030 was not fi­nan­cially vi­able. It de­clined to elab­o­rate.</p>
    <p>This de­ci­sion has led to Kep­pel po­ten­tially step­ping in but any deal re­quires a fresh in­jec­tion of funds. It will have an es­ti­mated $25 mil­lion in re­serves at the end of next year, but this is in­suf­fi­cient to cover the pro­jected $31 mil­lion re­quired for the cap­i­tal out­lay of the new land lease, club­house, recre­ational fa­cil­i­ties and Sime Course.</p>
    <p>To raise the $7 mil­lion to $10 mil­lion needed, Kep­pel is ask­ing its mem­bers to opt in to a top-up scheme – $3,210 (so­cial mem­bers), $5,350 (or­di­nary) and $8,025 (cor­po­rate). It is tar­get­ing 1,500 mem­bers and has set a Nov 7 dead­line.</p>
    <p>The re­sponse among Kep­pel’s roughly 5,000 mem­bers has been mixed, largely due to the Gov­ern­ment’s re­quire­ment that it must make the course avail­able to both its mem­bers and the gen­eral pub­lic.</p>
    <p>Re­tiree Soon Kim Tat, 59, has been a Kep­pel mem­ber for the past 10 years. He plays thrice a week and said: “I thought the opt-in fee is quite af­ford­able but I un­der­stand some peo­ple are un­happy with it so the club must tell us how they can guar­an­tee us a game.</p>
    <p>“Hope­fully they can come up with a good ar­range­ment be­cause even right now slots are be­ing filled up ev­ery day.”</p>
    <p>Among the other ques­tions in­clude the dif­fer­ence in green fees for Kep­pel mem­bers and the pub­lic, monthly sub­scrip­tion and al­lo­ca­tion of flights for mem­bers.</p>
    <p>When con­tacted, Kep­pel said it was too early to com­ment on these mat­ters.</p>
    <p>Should the deal pro­ceed, there could be a tem­po­rary in­crease in value of the Kep­pel mem­ber­ship which is cur­rently about $13,000, said Lee Lee Lang­dale, owner of club bro­ker­age Sin­golf Ser­vices.</p>
    <p>Af­ter fac­tor­ing in the ad­di­tional $5,350 top-up, one would have spent al­most $19,000 but will have ac­cess to an 18-hole course un­til 2030, a roughly sim­i­lar sit­u­a­tion to mem­bers at War­ren Coun­try Club, where the mem­ber­ship is about $23,000.</p>
    <p>“But at War­ren you won’t have to share the fa­cil­i­ties with the pub­lic, un­like at Sime in the fu­ture,” said Lang­dale. “So in the end it may not be such a good deal.”</p>
    <p>She added that mem­ber­ship prices for SICC – which are about $200,000 – were un­likely to drop given news in 2014 that the club had to forgo one course.</p>
    <p>“In the long term I even ex­pect it to in­crease as SICC is one of only a hand­ful of clubs that have a lease un­til 2040.”</p>
