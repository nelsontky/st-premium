    <p>SAN FRANCISCO • Li Hao­tong did not think he had any chance of be­ing a con­tender at this week’s PGA Cham­pi­onship. But, on Fri­day, he came out of nowhere with a bo­geyfree sec­ond round and sud­denly has an op­por­tu­nity to be­come the first Chi­nese man to win a Ma­jor.</p>
    <p>The world No. 114 birdied five of his first 10 holes at TPC Hard­ing Park in San Francisco en route to a five-un­der 65 and eight-un­der 132 to­tal which left him at a loss for words to ex­plain how he did it.</p>
    <p>“I didn’t even think I could play like this this week... (I’ve) got no con­fi­dence,” said the 25-year-old, who hit only four of 14 fair­ways dur­ing his round but fin­ished two shots clear of six play­ers, in­clud­ing two-time de­fend­ing cham­pion Brooks Koepka (68).</p>
    <p>“The last cou­ple days, I’ve... pretty much all hit in the right spots. Even (when I) miss the greens, I got a chance to (get) up and down. Also a lot of good lies in the rough.”</p>
    <p>Li came into the year’s first Ma­jor lack­ing any sense of con­fi­dence, given that his only two events since the Covid-19 shut­down re­sulted in a missed cut at last month’s Memorial Tour­na­ment and a share of 75th at last week’s World Golf Cham­pi­onships event in Mem­phis.</p>
    <p>His best fin­ish this year was a share of 18th place at the Euro­pean Tour’s Oman Open in Fe­bru­ary.</p>
    <p>When the PGA Tour was sus­pended in mid-March for three months, Li spent the break in China where he said he did very lit­tle. Be­cause of that, he did not ex­pect much go­ing into the week­end.</p>
    <p>“Well, I’ve got no ex­pec­ta­tion ac­tu­ally, be­cause you know, (the) last few months, (I’ve had to) stay at home do­ing noth­ing,” the Hu­nan na­tive said. “I just want to be out here, have fun.”</p>
    <p>This is the first time that a main­land Chi­nese player has led in any round of a Ma­jor cham­pi­onship.</p>
    <p>Li’s best fin­ish in a Ma­jor was a third place at the 2017 Open Cham­pi­onship at Royal Birk­dale where, as a 21-year-old, he closed with a stun­ning fi­nal-round 63. He was the 2014 PGA Tour Series-China Or­der of Merit cham­pion and is a twotime Euro­pean Tour win­ner.</p>
    <p>But Li, who turned pro in 2011 aged 16, was not sure what it would take for him to be­come the first player from China to win a Ma­jor.</p>
    <p>“I don’t know,” he said. “Well, (we’ve) still got two rounds left. Long way to go. Just want to play my best. If it hap­pens, it hap­pens.”</p>
    <p>Koepka was both­ered by tight­ness in his hip that re­quired at­ten­tion from a trainer, but birdied the dif­fi­cult par-four 18th to fin­ish at six un­der af­ter 36 holes.</p>
    <p>Overnight co-leader Ja­son Day (69) was tied with Li be­fore dis­as­ter struck on the par-four 12th where the Aus­tralian’s tee-shot found the rough and he missed a putt for a dou­ble bo­gey.</p>
    <p>Also two back of Li was English­man Tommy Fleet­wood, whose 64 matched the low­est score this week, and com­pa­triot Justin Rose, who carded a 68.</p>
    <p>Tiger Woods strug­gled with the put­ter and shot a two-over 72 to sit at even par.</p>
    <p>World No. 1 Justin Thomas shot an even round to fin­ish on the cut line of one over, while Rory McIl­roy over­came a dou­ble bo­gey on the par-four 12th for a 69 to be one un­der headed into the week­end.</p>
    <p>Well, I’ve got no ex­pec­ta­tion ac­tu­ally, be­cause you know, (the) last few months, (I’ve had to) stay at home do­ing noth­ing. I just want to be out here, have fun.</p>
