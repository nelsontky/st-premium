    <p>Head­ing back to school at 43, pro­fes­sional mu­si­cian Vicknes Vinayak Veerappan proves that age is not a lim­i­ta­tion and learn­ing is a life­long jour­ney.</p>
    <p>Mr Vicknes has been a free­lance in­struc­tor and a per­former since 1994, but it was his in­ter­ac­tion with a stu­dent that mo­ti­vated him to be­come a full-time ed­u­ca­tor.</p>
    <p>Devot­ing him­self to his classes, his monthly earn­ings dwin­dled to a quar­ter of what they used to be. But the now 46-year-old per­se­vered and grad­u­ated in April from Lasalle Col­lege of the Arts with a Bach­e­lor of Arts in mu­sic, val­i­dated by Gold­smiths at the Univer­sity of Lon­don.</p>
    <p>Mr Vicknes says get­ting back to school has been worth the ef­fort.</p>
    <p>“I was the sec­ond-old­est stu­dent in my de­gree pro­gramme. De­spite the com­plete over­haul to my life­style, I do not re­gret my choice be­cause this was a rare win­dow of op­por­tu­nity to up­grade my­self and re­set my ca­reer. I was de­ter­mined to see it through,” he says.</p>
    <p>Mr Vicknes’ pas­sion for drums be­gan in 1987, when as a stu­dent, he joined Bowen Sec­ondary School’s mil­i­tary band.</p>
    <p>Even­tu­ally, he be­came a pro­fes­sional mu­si­cian, per­form­ing on Asia tours with the likes of singer­song­writ­ers J. J. Lin and David Tao.</p>
    <p>While his per­for­mances took him across the globe, it was the teach­ing stints back home that struck a</p>
    <p>chord with him.</p>
    <p>As a free­lance in­struc­tor, he started teach­ing mu­sic to stu­dents at Sin­ga­pore’s main­stream schools in 2004.</p>
    <p>Re­calls Mr Vicknes: “When I taught classes, I took note of the mis­chievous stu­dents – like this boy stand­ing out­side – and made sure they sat in the first row for my les­son. When he was made mu­sic class leader, the boy had no choice but to be ac­count­able to his class­mates, and he put in a good ef­fort.”</p>
    <p>The stu­dent even­tu­ally per­formed in front of the school assem­bly with his peers and rushed to give his mu­sic teacher a hug af­ter the show.</p>
    <p>“He told me, ‘thank you for giv­ing me a chance when oth­ers did not’. That in­ci­dent was a turn­ing point for me. I loved chil­dren and I knew I had the po­ten­tial to reach out to more kids as an ed­u­ca­tor,” says Mr Vicknes.</p>
    <p>STRIK­ING THE RIGHT NOTE</p>
    <p>In 2017, he de­cided to first take up a diploma in law as a foun­da­tion for his sub­se­quent de­gree.</p>
    <p>The course lasted slightly less than a year and gave Mr Vicknes in­sight into copy­right and in­tel­lec­tual prop­erty prac­tices. This knowl­edge would serve him well in mu­sic pro­duc­tion projects.</p>
    <p>As he took up fewer gigs and teach­ing stints to make time for his stud­ies, Mr Vicknes saw his monthly earn­ings fall from about $4,000 to about $1,000.</p>
    <p>His fam­ily was sup­port­ive and his par­ents watched over his 15-yearold son out­side school hours.</p>
    <p>Mr Vicknes con­sulted with Lasalle on the best way to fi­nance his mu­sic de­gree, which in­cluded avail­ing him­self of the Skill­sFu­ture Mid-Ca­reer En­hanced Sub­sidy for about 90 per cent of his fees.</p>
    <p>He turned to bur­saries and his sis­ter’s Cen­tral Prov­i­dent Fund ac­count for the re­main­ing amount.</p>
    <p>“As se­nior stu­dents, we have many op­tions to fi­nance our stud­ies. Based on my ex­pe­ri­ence, I have en­cour­aged oth­ers to find out more and not be de­mor­alised while seek­ing out new cour­ses,” says Mr Vicknes.</p>
    <p>While jug­gling re­spon­si­bil­i­ties along­side his classes was tax­ing, he re­calls one un­ex­pected in­stance that brought some good cheer: he re­ceived a stu­dent con­ces­sion card for his com­mute.</p>
    <p>“I had not been on stu­dent fare since my school days and here I was us­ing it for my jour­neys again. It was a pleas­ant sur­prise,” he says.</p>
    <p>Go­ing into his fi­nal year, Mr Vicknes saw Covid-19 cause painful dis­rup­tions in all sec­tors, in­clud­ing the arts in­dus­try, in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>Now a freshly-minted grad­u­ate with a mu­sic de­gree, he is en­cour­ag­ing se­nior mu­si­cians like him­self to take up cour­ses while they weather the out­break.</p>
    <p>“I ex­pe­ri­enced a sim­i­lar im­pact as the one brought on by this pan­demic a few years ago when I was at­tend­ing classes and I could not work or earn as much as I used to,” says Mr Vicknes.</p>
    <p>“I un­der­stand what my friends are go­ing through now. But I re­mind them that we are not born mu­si­cians, we be­come mu­si­cians.</p>
    <p>“Your tal­ent has to be brought out through train­ing and hard work. This is not the end of the world, it is a chance to learn more and take up new op­por­tu­ni­ties,” he adds.</p>
    <p>Asked if he is ready to put his books away for now, he says no. With his sights set on a teach­ing trainee­ship, Mr Vicknes is just get­ting started.</p>
    <p>When I taught classes, I took note of the mis­chievous stu­dents – like this boy stand­ing out­side – and made sure they sat in the first row for my les­son. When he was made mu­sic class leader, the boy had no choice but to be ac­count­able to his class­mates, and he put in a good ef­fort.</p>
