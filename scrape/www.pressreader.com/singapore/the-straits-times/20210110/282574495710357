    <p>The San An­to­nio Spurs will be walk­ing tall into a road game against a down­trod­den Min­nesota Tim­ber­wolves team who have been un­able to find their way with­out Karl-An­thony Towns.</p>
    <p>The Spurs and Tim­ber­wolves are set for a dou­ble header in the Twin Cities, with a quick tran­si­tion to a sec­ond game to­day.</p>
    <p>The Spurs ended a four-game los­ing streak in style, tak­ing over Los An­ge­les this week with a win over the Clip­pers on Tues­day and another over the Lak­ers on Thurs­day.</p>
    <p>Not only did San An­to­nio (4-4) hang a 118-109 vic­tory on the Lak­ers, it was far from a sneak at­tack since the Spurs had showed what they were ca­pa­ble of in a 116-113 win over the Clip­pers two days ear­lier in the same build­ing.</p>
    <p>The Lak­ers were es­sen­tially near full strength with LeBron James and An­thony Davis fit and fir­ing, although they were miss­ing Ken­tavi­ous Cald­well-Pope.</p>
    <p>The Spurs went right af­ter the Lak­ers, tak­ing a 34-26 lead af­ter one quar­ter. LaMar­cus Aldridge scored 28 points in the game and DeMar DeRozan had 19 points with eight as­sists.</p>
    <p>The Spurs are now 4-1 when Aldridge is on the court. The vet­eran missed two pre­vi­ous de­feats against the Lak­ers around New Year’s with a sore knee.</p>
    <p>“It’s the same style of play as last year, there’s noth­ing dif­fer­ent,” head coach Gregg Popovich said in com­par­ing this year’s team with his 32-39 squad a year ago who went 1-6 against both LA teams.</p>
    <p>“We’ve just been to­gether a lit­tle longer, added a cou­ple more play­ers, we’re a lit­tle deeper than we were and they’re play­ing well.”</p>
    <p>Af­ter a 2-0 start, the Tim­ber­wolves are on a six-game los­ing streak. The most re­cent de­feat came on Thurs­day when they fell 135-117 against the Port­land Trail Blaz­ers.</p>
    <p>If there is any con­so­la­tion in de­feat, the 117 points were the Tim­ber­wolves’ most in any game this sea­son. Of course, the 135 they al­lowed, too, were a sea­son high.</p>
    <p>A de­fence that saw the Trail Blaz­ers shoot 54.4 per cent from the field needs work. En­ter­ing play on Fri­day, Min­nesota’s 121.9 points al­lowed per game was sec­ond worst in the Na­tional Bas­ket­ball As­so­ci­a­tion to the Wash­ing­ton Wiz­ards (122.9).</p>
    <p>“Chem­istry plays a ma­jor role in (de­fence), fig­ur­ing out prob­lems, but I think we’re all right, though,” guard D’An­gelo Rus­sell said.</p>
    <p>“I think we can look on the film and see where we can act on those mis­steps and try to get bet­ter.”</p>
    <p>Towns re­mains out in­def­i­nitely af­ter he dis­lo­cated his wrist two games into the sea­son.</p>
    <p>Min­nesota won both games he played and have lost ev­ery game since.</p>
