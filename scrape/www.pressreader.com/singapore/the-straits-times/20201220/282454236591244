    <p>Hand­made to or­der and exquisitel­y fine in tex­ture, the Hong Kongstyle chee cheong fun at hawker stall Xiang Gang Xin Kou Wei is com­pa­ra­ble with those at classy Can­tonese dim sum restau­rants.</p>
    <p>With prices start­ing at $2 a plate, th­ese steamed rice rolls at Block 117 Alju­nied Mar­ket And Food Cen­tre are a steal. Hot favourites among cus­tomers are the prawn chee cheong fun ($2.50) and char siew chee cheong fun ($2.50).</p>
    <p>At such prices, it is un­der­stand­able that frozen, in­stead of fresh, prawns are used in the fill­ing. But such is his skill that stall­holder Lo Cheuk Hang, 69, makes them per­fectly palat­able.</p>
    <p>Though small, the prawns are bouncy and free of stale fishy odours that you some­times find in less skil­fully pre­pared seafood.</p>
    <p>The chee cheong fun is thin and silky and has an at­trac­tive sheen.</p>
    <p>Mr Lo blends his own sea­son­ing sauce us­ing Hong Kong-made dark as well as light soya sauces and other in­gre­di­ents.</p>
    <p>The savoury sauce, with just a hint of sweet­ness, goes well with the chee cheong fun. It is so flavour­some, you do not need the ac­com­pa­ny­ing chilli dip. A gen­er­ous sprin­kling of roasted se­same seeds com­pletes the dish.</p>
    <p>An un­der­stated star dish is the fried two flavour chee cheong fun ($2), which is you tiao chee cheong fun. Slices of soft chewy fried dough frit­ters are used as fill­ing.</p>
    <p>The unas­sum­ing dish is an old­school ver­sion of chee cheong fun not eas­ily found th­ese days. It is avail­able at the stall, ex­cept on Mon­days when Mr Lo’s you tiao sup­plier is closed.</p>
    <p>Mr Lo started work­ing as a kitchen as­sis­tant at the age of nine. He be­came an ap­pren­tice to a dim sum chef at 15.</p>
    <p>Orig­i­nally from Hong Kong, he came to Sin­ga­pore in 1979 to helm the dim sum sec­tion of Golden Crown Restau­rant in Com­mon­wealth Av­enue.</p>
    <p>The restau­rant – which is no longer in oper­a­tion, but still sells moon­cakes yearly – was fa­mous for its dim sum and also for be­ing the first in Sin­ga­pore to pro­duce Por­tuguese egg tarts in 1998.</p>
    <p>Mr Lo started his hawker stall in 2006 af­ter the restau­rant closed.</p>
    <p>Aside from chee cheong fun, his Can­tonese-style por­ridge – avail­able from 9am – is worth try­ing.</p>
    <p>His ver­sion is made us­ing three types of rice – Aus­tralian short­grain rice, Thai jas­mine rice and gluti­nous rice – and no starch is added to it. He cooks the por­ridge in small batches through­out the day.</p>
    <p>The dish has bulk and does not turn watery even if you take your time eat­ing it.</p>
    <p>Mr Lo also uses fresh chilled lean pork, which he slices thinly. No ar­ti­fi­cial ten­deriser is used, but ev­ery slice is su­perbly ten­der.</p>
    <p>Go for the Mixed Sign­board Por­ridge ($4), which comes with sliced fish, pork, pork liver, cen­tury egg and peanuts. You get pieces of house-fried pork in­tes­tine, but I find the odour over­pow­er­ing.</p>
    <p>The Freshly Made Por­ridge ($3) is boat con­gee, which comes with fish slices and a gen­er­ous amount of cut­tle­fish. Add an egg for 50 cents.</p>
    <p>Mr Lo is lav­ish with his use of top­pings – you tiao, spring onion and fried onion.</p>
