    <p>• With a piece of cloth strapped around his fore­head as his face mask, cof­fee ven­dor Sarip­pudin chat­ted cheer­fully with his cus­tomers at his push­cart while prepar­ing steam­ing cups of the brew for them.</p>
    <p>All were unmasked. One of them, Mr Fauzi, who lives only a stone’s throw from where the push­cart was in a small side street, had just re­turned home from work.</p>
    <p>Clad only i n a sarong, t he 55-year-old cleaner said: “I changed my clothes and came here to chat with him.”</p>
    <p>Asked why he was not wear­ing a mask, he replied sheep­ishly that he was stop­ping by for a short while only, adding: “Usu­ally when I spend a longer time here to chat, I will wear a mask and pants.”</p>
    <p>The cof­fee ven­dor is a close friend, so it was all right, he said.</p>
    <p>Mr Sarip­pudin, 49, chimed in: “I also take off the mask if I find it hard to breathe. Wear­ing a mask all the time also ir­ri­tates my ears.”</p>
    <p>Here, in the In­done­sian cap­i­tal of Jakarta which reim­posed a par</p>
    <p>tial lock­down on Sept 14 due to surg­ing in­fec­tions, many res­i­dents re­main non­cha­lant about the dan­gers of Covid-19.</p>
    <p>Street-food hawker Anton Wid­iantoro, 25, whose mask was hang­ing un­der his chin, said: “Well, many peo­ple are in­fected and hos­pi­talised. Whether it kills, it de­pends on the dis­ease.</p>
    <p>“Some peo­ple are des­tined to die, but some are not.”</p>
    <p>In an­other neigh­bour­hood in cen­tral Jakarta, 25-year-old house­wife Siti Fathya Ma­hani and her neigh­bour were chat­ting and laugh­ing at a food stall near a busy train sta­tion.</p>
    <p>Ms Fathya had her mask pulled un­der her chin, while her neigh­bour – who re­fused to give her name – had none.</p>
    <p>The chil­dren play­ing around them were not wear­ing masks.</p>
    <p>Ms Fathya said un­apolo­get­i­cally</p>
    <p>that she did not be­lieve wear­ing one could help curb the spread of the virus, as a rel­a­tive of her hus­band had con­tracted it de­spite heed­ing health pro­to­cols.</p>
    <p>Three of her neigh­bours were in­fected with Covid-19, but re­mained asymp­to­matic.</p>
    <p>Ms Fathya was also not overly wor­ried, be­liev­ing the coro­n­avirus killed only peo­ple with un­der­ly­ing health con­di­tions.</p>
    <p>She added: “I can­not wear a mask for a long time. It’s stuffy.</p>
    <p>“I can put it on for j ust one minute, then I must pull it down again.”</p>
    <p>The Jakarta ad­min­is­tra­tion has vowed to come down hard on those who flout the rules by slap­ping fines from 250,000 ru­piah (S$23), but it ap­pears to have lit­tle ef­fect thus far.</p>

        <p data-role="text">Bike riders tak&#xAD;ing a rest near a train sta&#xAD;tion in Jakarta were seen wear&#xAD;ing masks im&#xAD;prop&#xAD;erly or not at all. De&#xAD;spite surg&#xAD;ing in&#xAD;fec&#xAD;tions, many Jakarta res&#xAD;i&#xAD;dents are non&#xAD;cha&#xAD;lant about the dan&#xAD;gers of Covid-19.</p>
