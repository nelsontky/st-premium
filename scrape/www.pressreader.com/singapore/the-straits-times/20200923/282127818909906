    <p>In a bid to de­lay the ex­e­cu­tion of his client, the lawyer for a con­victed Sin­ga­porean drug traf­ficker ar­gued be­fore the Court of Ap­peal yes­ter­day that death row in­mates are not be­ing treated equally.</p>
    <p>Mr M. Ravi con­tended that ex­e­cu­tions are not be­ing car­ried out in the same or­der that the death sen­tences were meted out.</p>
    <p>He said his client, Syed Suhail Syed Zin, 44, was sched­uled to be hanged be­fore those who were sen­tenced be­fore him.</p>
    <p>The lawyer sug­gested that, as a re­sult of travel re­stric­tions due to the Covid-19 pan­demic, ex­e­cu­tions of for­eign­ers are be­ing pushed back.</p>
    <p>He said his client be­lieves that the death sen­tence passed on for­eign­ers will not be car­ried out un­til the bor­ders re­open, as they do not have ac­cess to fam­ily mem­bers and there may be is­sues in repa­tri­at­ing their re­mains.</p>
    <p>Mr Ravi ar­gued that this was a breach of Ar­ti­cle 12 of the Con­sti­tu­tion, which guar­an­tees equal­ity be­fore the law.</p>
    <p>Se­nior State Coun­sel Fran­cis Ng, for the At­tor­ney-Gen­eral, ar­gued that there is no pro­vi­sion re­quir­ing sen­tences to be car­ried out in the same se­quence in which they were im­posed.</p>
    <p>The court, com­pris­ing Chief Jus­tice Sun­daresh Menon and Judges of Ap­peal An­drew Phang and Ju­dith</p>
    <p>Prakash, asked for fur­ther sub­mis­sions on this is­sue.</p>
    <p>In a state­ment, the Min­istry of Home Af­fairs (MHA) said there was no dis­crim­i­na­tion or im­pro­pri­ety in the sched­ul­ing of ex­e­cu­tions.</p>
    <p>An ex­e­cu­tion will be sched­uled af­ter an in­mate has ex­hausted all le­gal chan­nels of ap­peal and clemency, re­gard­less of whether the pris­oner is a Sin­ga­porean or a for­eigner, it said. The min­istry added that its re­sponse to the “base­less” al­le­ga­tions will be filed be­fore the next court hear­ing.</p>
    <p>Suhail was sen­tenced to death by the High Court on Dec 2, 2015, for traf­fick­ing 38.84g of heroin.</p>
    <p>His ap­peal was dis­missed on Oct 18, 2018. On July 5 last year, Suhail was told that his pe­ti­tion for clemency had been re­jected. On Sept 11 this year, he was told that he would be hanged last Fri­day. Mr Ravi took up his case.</p>
    <p>Last Thurs­day, his ap­pli­ca­tion to the High Court for ju­di­cial re­view was dis­missed, but Suhail’s ex­e­cu­tion was stayed pend­ing the ap­peal.</p>
    <p>Mr Ravi also sought ju­di­cial re­view of the clemency process.</p>
    <p>Point­ing to the dearth of suc­cess­ful clemency pe­ti­tions, he ar­gued that the va­lid­ity of the process has been “ex­tin­guished”.</p>
    <p>Chief Jus­tice Menon said an in­fer­ence can also be drawn that the cases lacked merit. Jus­tice Phang added: “You can­not take a neg­a­tive re­sult and then work back­wards to say the process is un­fair.”</p>
    <p>Mr Ravi also re­ferred to a let­ter from Suhail to his for­mer lawyer that the Sin­ga­pore Prison Ser­vice (SPS) copied to the At­tor­ney-Gen­eral’s Cham­bers (AGC).</p>
    <p>In a bid to dis­qual­ify the AGC team, he ar­gued that this was a breach of so­lic­i­tor-client priv­i­lege, which ren­dered the pros­e­cu­to­rial process in­valid.</p>
    <p>Se­nior Coun­sel Ng told the court that he has not seen any let­ter.</p>
    <p>Chief Jus­tice Menon said he strug­gled to fol­low Mr Ravi’s ar­gu­ments, while Jus­tice Phang called it a “non sequitur”.</p>
    <p>MHA ex­plained that at his ap­peal in 2018, Suhail had told the court he wanted to call his un­cle as a wit­ness. AGC then checked with the SPS on whether Suhail had ex­pressed prior in­ten­tion to call his un­cle.</p>
    <p>SPS then sent copies of his let­ters to his un­cle and his then lawyer to the AGC. At the time, there was no le­gal pro­hi­bi­tion against do­ing so, said MHA.</p>
