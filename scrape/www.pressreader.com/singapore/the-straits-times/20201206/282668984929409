    <p>1 HARD AT WORK Edited by Ger­ard Sas­ges and Ng Shi Wen NUS Press, 2019, $40.66, avail­able at bit.ly/Har­datWork_SN</p>
    <p>“Aiyah, all jobs hard one lah,” de­clares a bub­ble tea seller in this fas­ci­nat­ing ethnog­ra­phy of in­ter­views with 60 work­ers in Sin­ga­pore from all walks of life – flight at­ten­dant, aca­demic ghost­writer, fu­neral direc­tor, ice­cream un­cle, Thai disco singer and many more.</p>
    <p>Be­tween 2014 and 2017, nearly 100 Na­tional Univer­sity of Sin­ga­pore (NUS) stu­dents were dis­patched to in­ter­view close to 300 peo­ple about their jobs.</p>
    <p>Hard At Work, which was short­listed this year for the Sin­ga­pore Lit­er­a­ture Prize for English cre­ative non-fiction, com­prises a se­lec­tion of these in­ter­views, pre­sented in un­var­nished ver­nac­u­lar and ac­com­pa­nied by Ng’s photos.</p>
    <p>From driv­ers to drag queens, these in­ter­views re­veal the in­te­rior lives of these work­ers and what they think about the way they make a liv­ing.</p>
    <p>“The thought of quit­ting this job never leaves my mind,” says a Star­bucks barista. “I’m al­ways think­ing about it be­cause this job gives me no life.”</p>
    <p>2 SOLO: HOW TO WORK ALONE (AND NOT LOSE YOUR MIND) By Re­becca Seal Pro­file, 2020, $32.10, avail­able at bit.ly/SoloHowWor­kAlone_RS</p>
    <p>Seal, a Bri­tish jour­nal­ist who has free­lanced for more than a decade, be­gan writ­ing this book years ago for peo­ple who work alone.</p>
    <p>This year, thanks to the coro­n­avirus pan­demic, the rest of the world has joined her.</p>
    <p>In Solo, Seal ex­am­ines what it is like to work alone, draw­ing on re­search in or­gan­i­sa­tion psy­chol­ogy, eco­nom­ics and be­havioural sci­ence to demon­strate how solo work­ers may be even more at risk of burnout, and out­lin­ing tech­niques to main­tain work­life bal­ance in an of­fice of one.</p>
    <p>3 CUBED: A SE­CRET HIS­TORY OF THE WORK­PLACE By Nikil Saval An­chor Books, 2015, $25.73, avail­able at bit.ly/Cubed_NS</p>
    <p>Do you miss the of­fice? Get nos­tal­gic – or not – with this deep dive into how the white-col­lar work­place, with its cu­bi­cles and cor­po­rate rit­u­als, came to be.</p>
    <p>Saval, an Amer­i­can mag­a­zine editor who was elected to Penn­syl­va­nia’s state Se­nate last month, looks at as­pects of the of­fice from ar­chi­tec­ture to lit­er­a­ture.</p>
    <p>Her­man Melville’s 1853 short story Bartleby, The Scrivener – a sem­i­nal por­trait of burnout – makes an ap­pear­ance.</p>
    <p>4 THEN WE CAME TO THE END By Joshua Fer­ris Pen­guin, 2007, $19.75, avail­able at bit.ly/TWCEnd_JF</p>
    <p>In a Chicago ad­ver­tis­ing agency im­per­iled by the burst­ing of the dot­com bub­ble, anx­ious em­ploy­ees wait for news of the next lay­off, even as they trade pantry gos­sip and scav­enge of­fice fur­ni­ture from those al­ready re­trenched.</p>
    <p>Fer­ris cap­tures the idio­syn­cra­sies of nine-to-five pur­ga­tory in this caus­tic satire told in first­per­son plu­ral.</p>
    <p>“We were frac­tious and over­paid,” say the work­ers. “Most of us liked most ev­ery­one, a few of us hated spe­cific in­di­vid­u­als, one or two peo­ple loved ev­ery­one and every­thing. Those who loved ev­ery­one were unan­i­mously reviled.”</p>
