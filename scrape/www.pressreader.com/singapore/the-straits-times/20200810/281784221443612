    <p>PETALING JAYA • A Malaysian is re­port­edly in­volved in or­gan traf­fick­ing by lur­ing poverty-stricken vic­tims from around the world to sell their or­gans, ac­cord­ing to a Bri­tish news­pa­per.</p>
    <p>The Sun re­ported that the man had boasted to the Bri­tish pa­per that he had mas­ter­minded 45 il­licit kid­ney sales.</p>
    <p>The re­port claimed he be­gan us­ing a Face­book group two years ago to buy and sell kid­neys, sourc­ing po­ten­tial or­gan donors from the poor.</p>
    <p>“They’re all se­ri­ous. No­body wants to sell their kid­ney if there is no fi­nan­cial prob­lem,” he al­legedly told The Sun in Kuching, cap­i­tal of the East Malaysian state of Sarawak.</p>
    <p>The Sun claimed that the man had boasted to them that he had more than 100 po­ten­tial kid­ney sellers.</p>
    <p>He also al­legedly has a “sur­plus” of po­ten­tial kid­ney sellers in In­dia, Africa, South Amer­ica and all over Asia.</p>
    <p>The man claimed his fees in­clude bribes for a clinic in Manila in the Philip­pines to per­form the op­er­a­tion.</p>
    <p>The 48-year-old father of four, who has no med­i­cal ex­pe­ri­ence, was met by The Sun’s un­der­cover re­porters in Sarawak in which they had pre­tended to be kid­ney buy­ers for a rel­a­tive in Bri­tain who needed a trans­plant.</p>
    <p>The re­port said the man ini­tially charged a fee of £55,000 (S$98,550) for sup­ply­ing the kid­ney and an ad­di­tional £65,000 for pay­ment to the clinic but even­tu­ally dropped t he to­tal fee to £85,000.</p>
    <p>The Sun claimed the en­tire fee is paid di­rectly to the Malaysian.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to the re­port, the man said that the rules ban­ning trans­plant oper­a­tions be­tween donors and re­cip­i­ents who are not friends or re­lated by blood are sorted out with bribes and forged papers.</p>
    <p>“In Manila, cash is king. Money talks,” he was quoted as say­ing.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to The Sun, the Malaysian has al­legedly been in­volved in the il­le­gal trade since 2010.</p>
    <p>His op­er­a­tion was then cen­tred in China in which he had asked pa­tients to leave China within two weeks to “dis­pose of the ev­i­dence” even though they were still not com­pletely healed.</p>
    <p>How­ever, the re­port said the man stopped his China oper­a­tions in 2016 when he heard that kid­neys were mostly taken from the Uighur com­mu­ni­ties who were held in con­cen­tra­tion camps.</p>
    <p>He then re­port­edly moved his oper­a­tions to the Philip­pines. He also told The Sun that he was well aware of the risks of this il­le­gal trade.</p>
    <p>Or­gan trad­ing is il­le­gal in</p>
    <p>Malaysia, while un­der Philip­pine law, hu­man traf­fick­ing for or­gans could land the man 20 years in prison.</p>
    <p>“I’m do­ing a risky job deal­ing with the kid­ney buyer and seller. When you get caught, it’s years in jail,” he re­port­edly said.</p>
    <p>Ms Fiona Loud, pol­icy di­rec­tor of Kid­ney Care UK, said the il­licit trade car­ried out by bro­kers such as the Malaysian man is “com­pletely un­eth­i­cal, im­moral, crim­i­nal and dan­ger­ous”.</p>
    <p>“No mat­ter how tempted peo­ple might be to get a kid­ney on the black mar­ket, it doesn’t usu­ally lead to a good out­come,” she told The Sun.</p>
