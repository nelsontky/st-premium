    <p>WASH­ING­TON The US State Depart­ment has ap­proved the po­ten­tial sales of three weapons sys­tems to Tai­wan, in­clud­ing sen­sors, mis­siles and ar­tillery, that could have a to­tal value of US$1.8 bil­lion (S$2.4 bil­lion), the Pen­tagon said on Wed­nes­day.</p>
    <p>Reuters re­ported last week that the White House was mov­ing for­ward with five sep­a­rate sales of so­phis­ti­cated mil­i­tary equip­ment to Tai­wan with a to­tal value of around US$5 bil­lion as the Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion ramps up pres­sure on China and con­cerns in­crease about Beijing’s in­ten­tions to­wards Tai­wan.</p>
    <p>Among other weapons sys­tems, Wed­nes­day’s for­mal no­ti­fi­ca­tions to Congress by the State Depart­ment were for 11 truck-based rocket launch­ers made by Lock­heed Martin called a High Mo­bil­ity Ar­tillery Rocket Sys­tem, for an es­ti­mated cost of US$436.1 mil­lion.</p>
    <p>The no­ti­fi­ca­tions also cov­ered 135 AGM-84H Stand­off Land Attack Mis­sile Ex­panded Re­sponse Mis­siles and re­lated equip­ment made by Boe­ing, for an es­ti­mated US$1.008 bil­lion, and six MS-110 Recce ex­ter­nal sen­sor pods made by Collins Aerospace for jets, at an es­ti­mated cost of US$367.2 mil­lion.</p>
    <p>Fur­ther con­gres­sional no­ti­fi­ca­tions are ex­pected to fol­low, in­clud­ing drones made by Gen­eral Atomics as well as land-based Har­poon anti-ship mis­siles, made by Boe­ing, to serve as coastal de­fence cruise mis­siles.</p>
    <p>Sources have said the 100 cruise mis­sile sta­tions and 400 mis­siles would cost about US$2 bil­lion.</p>
    <p>The for­mal no­ti­fi­ca­tions give the United States Congress 30 days to ob­ject to any sales, but this is un­likely given broad bi­par­ti­san sup­port for the de­fence of Tai­wan.</p>
    <p>The de­fence and for­eign min­istries in Tai­wan wel­comed the news, say­ing the weapons would help im­prove de­fen­sive ca­pa­bil­i­ties.</p>
    <p>“This arms sale shows that the United States at­taches great im­por­tance to the strate­gic position of the Indo-Pa­cific re­gion and the Tai­wan Strait, and is ac­tively as­sist­ing our coun­try in strength­en­ing our over­all de­fence ca­pa­bil­i­ties,” Tai­wan’s De­fence Min­istry said.</p>
    <p>China con­sid­ers Tai­wan a way­ward prov­ince it has vowed to bring un­der con­trol, by force if nec­es­sary. Wash­ing­ton con­sid­ers it an im­por­tant demo­cratic out­post and is re­quired by law to pro­vide the is­land with the means to de­fend it­self.</p>
    <p>The Chi­nese em­bassy did not im­me­di­ately re­spond to a re­quest for com­ment, but China’s For­eign Min­istry said last week that US arms sales to Tai­wan se­verely dam­aged China’s sovereignt­y and se­cu­rity in­ter­ests.</p>
    <p>It urged Wash­ing­ton to can­cel the planned sales and warned that Beijing would “make a le­git­i­mate and nec­es­sary re­sponse ac­cord­ing to how the sit­u­a­tion de­vel­ops.”</p>
