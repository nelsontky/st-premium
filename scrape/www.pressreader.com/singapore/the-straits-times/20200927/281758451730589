    <p>Up to 50 sites across Sin­ga­pore are re­tail­ing un­branded diesel at half the price posted at reg­u­lar pumps op­er­ated by the oil giants.</p>
    <p>This is three times the num­ber of so-called “white pumps” when The Sun­day Times last re­ported on the trend in 2014.</p>
    <p>Th­ese sites are mostly in in­dus­trial ar­eas such as Sungei Kadut, Wood­lands and Tuas.</p>
    <p>Checks by The Sun­day Times re­vealed that at least one is in a mixed district of Sin Ming, which has half a dozen noz­zles, and even a car­wash. The site sits right next door to a Na­tional En­vi­ron­ment Agency re­gional of­fice.</p>
    <p>Diesel is around $1.50 per litre at reg­u­lar sta­tions, but is 70 to 80 cents a litre at th­ese white pumps, which are sited on plots far cheaper than those oc­cu­pied by reg­u­lar sta­tions.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to Ur­ban Re­de­vel­op­ment Author­ity (URA) guide­lines, only cer­tain in­dus­tries, such as those in trans­port-re­lated fields, are al­lowed to set up their own diesel pumps.</p>
    <p>The fuel must be for their own use and can­not be sold to the pub­lic.</p>
    <p>The le­gal­ity of such pumps came into fo­cus at the lat­est Au­di­tor-Gen­eral Of­fice’s (AGO) re­port.</p>
    <p>Be­tween Novem­ber last year and Jan­uary this year, the AGO found 41 sus­pected unau­tho­rised sub­tenants on 12 of 15 JTC Cor­po­ra­tion premises.</p>
    <p>On four of th­ese premises, the AGO found il­le­gal stor­age and sale of diesel to the pub­lic, which it said posed en­vi­ron­men­tal and safety risks.</p>
    <p>The JTC said it was work­ing with the au­thor­i­ties to take ac­tion against ten­ants who store or sell diesel il­le­gally.</p>
    <p>When asked, JTC and the Sin­ga­pore Civil De­fence Force (SCDF) did not say what ac­tion they had taken.</p>
    <p>But in a joint state­ment last week, the two noted that “JTC con­ducts reg­u­lar in­spec­tions on our lessees and ten­ants on JTC land to de­tect any unau­tho­rised use of land or ac­tiv­i­ties”.</p>
    <p>“We are aware of feed­back re­gard­ing the unau­tho­rised sale of diesel at some JTC premises,” the joint re­ply said. “Com­pa­nies that want to in­stall diesel tanks and store diesel on JTC’s premises must ob­tain ap­proval from JTC and SCDF be­fore do­ing so.</p>
    <p>“JTC and SCDF will work to­gether to take en­force­ment ac­tion against lessees and ten­ants who en­gage in unau­tho­rised stor­age of diesel.”</p>
    <p>The JTC added that it will also work with the URA to “take ap­pro­pri­ate ac­tion against of­fend­ing lessees and ten­ants who sell diesel il­le­gally”.</p>
    <p>It said any­one who has in­for­ma­tion on unau­tho­rised sale of diesel can call 1800-568-7000.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to in­dus­try sources, most white-pump op­er­a­tors get their fuel di­rectly from oil re­finer­ies here. But some are from un­known sources.</p>
    <p>“You can never be sure about the fuel qual­ity at th­ese pumps,” one source said. “The ac­cu­racy of their pump me­ters is also ques­tion­able.”</p>
    <p>Au­to­mo­tive ex­perts also warn of risks of en­gine dam­age.</p>
    <p>“Newer diesel en­gines are highly pre­cise, and re­quire the lat­est Euro 6 fu­els. Oth­er­wise, their in­jec­tors will get clogged, re­sult­ing in weaker per­for­mance, poorer ef­fi­ciency and even break­downs,” the source said.</p>
    <p>Com­mer­cial ve­hi­cle fleet owner Andy Goh said he used to fill up at</p>
    <p>white pumps but has since stopped.</p>
    <p>“It’s cheaper, but there’s no power. It’s quite ev­i­dent – soon af­ter you fill up, you feel the power drop­ping. I un­der­stand from work­shops that there’s been a lot of break­downs as­so­ci­ated with poor diesel qual­ity.”</p>
    <p>En­gi­neer Ng Tzong Sheng, who drives a diesel-pow­ered Skoda, said he too had the same ex­pe­ri­ence, and has since stopped pa­tro­n­is­ing such pumps.</p>
    <p>“Just af­ter 20,000km, all the in­jec­tors and other com­po­nents were clogged with car­bon,” he said.</p>
    <p>ExxonMo­bil, the largest fuel sta­tion op­er­a­tor here, would not com­ment on white pumps di­rectly, but said fu­els in its re­tail net­work “keep to all reg­u­la­tions”, and that it is “com­mit­ted to car­ry­ing out our op­er­a­tions safely”.</p>
    <p>In an oblique ref­er­ence to the lower prices of­fered at th­ese white pumps, it noted: “We in­vest sig­nif­i­cantly into our sup­ply chain and ser­vice sta­tions to guar­an­tee the sup­ply of high-qual­ity fu­els to our cus­tomers.”</p>
    <p>CHEAPER BUT NO POWER</p>
    <p>It’s cheaper, but there’s no power. It’s quite ev­i­dent – soon af­ter you fill up, you feel the power drop­ping. I un­der­stand from work­shops that there’s been a lot of break­downs as­so­ci­ated with poor diesel qual­ity.</p>
