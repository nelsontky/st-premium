    <p>NEW YORK • For­mer Gold­man Sachs Group banker Roger Ng has asked for the for­eign bribery case against him to be dis­missed, say­ing he “warned” the bank not to do busi­ness with Malaysian fi­nancier Jho Low.</p>
    <p>Ng, who says he told Gold­man that Low was “not to be trusted”, is fac­ing trial next March on charges of bribery and mon­ey­laun­der­ing con­spir­acy.</p>
    <p>He is ac­cused of help­ing Malaysia’s for­mer prime min­is­ter Na­jib Razak and oth­ers em­bez­zle at least US$2.7 bil­lion (S$3.63 bil­lion) from the 1Malaysia De­vel­op­ment Ber­had fund, known as 1MDB. Low is ac­cused of mas­ter­mind­ing the scheme.</p>
    <p>In a 126-page fil­ing, Ng says the United States has no busi­ness prose­cut­ing him be­cause the al­leged crimes were com­mit­ted in Malaysia. He also ar­gues that his for­mer boss, Tim Leiss­ner, an ex-Gold­man banker who has agreed to plead guilty and tes­tify against him, is the cen­tral fig­ure in the scheme be­cause he per­suaded the bank to do busi­ness with Low.</p>
    <p>As early as March 2010, Ng “specif­i­cally warned” his su­pe­ri­ors at Gold­man to “use cau­tion in deal­ing with Low”, de­fence lawyer Marc Ag­nifilo says in the fil­ing, adding: “Ng’s warn­ings were shared with the high­est lev­els of the com­pli­ance and le­gal di­vi­sions of the com­pany. The com­pany did not lis­ten to him.”</p>
    <p>Gold­man’s spokesman, Leiss­ner’s at­tor­ney and a spokesman for Act­ing US At­tor­ney Seth DuCharme in New York, whose of­fice is prose­cut­ing the case, de­clined to com­ment.</p>
    <p>Low, who has de­nied wrong­do­ing, is con­sid­ered a fugi­tive and has been charged in ab­sen­tia in Malaysia and the US with money laun­der­ing and other of­fences.</p>
    <p>Gold­man has al­ready agreed to pay bil­lions of dol­lars in penal­ties to the Jus­tice De­part­ment and other US au­thor­i­ties for its role in the 1MDB scan­dal, the big­gest for-</p>
    <p>eign bribery case in US en­force­ment his­tory.</p>
    <p>Ng con­cedes that he first in­tro­duced Low to the bank, but says that was “in early 2009, when no one had rea­son to know that Low was run­ning a fraud scheme”.</p>
    <p>By 2012, he says, Leiss­ner had be­come Low’s main Gold­man con­tact and the “more pow­er­ful” and “rain-mak­ing part­ner”.</p>
    <p>“It was... Leiss­ner alone who there­after lied for Low, pro­tected Low and ul­ti­mately be­came a fullfledge­d crim­i­nal in the ser­vice of Low,” he ar­gues.</p>
    <p>Leiss­ner, one of Gold­man’s top bankers in Asia, ad­mit­ted to con­spir­ing to laun­der money and vi­o­lat­ing US anti-bribery laws as he par­tic­i­pated in a kick­back scheme from 2009 to 2014 to get 1MDB’s busi­ness. He is sched­uled to tes­tify against Ng at the trial.</p>
    <p>In the fil­ing, Mr Ag­nifilo also as­sails a “si­lence” pro­vi­sion he says the US put in place as part of its multi­bil­lion-dol­lar de­ferred pros­e­cu­tion agree­ment with Gold­man. The re­quire­ment means that any Gold­man of­fi­cial Ng warned about Low will now be “afraid” of telling the truth, wor­ried it would void the bank’s deal with the US.</p>
    <p>He says the pro­vi­sion, “en­forced at the sole dis­cre­tion of the gov­ern­ment, en­sures that no Gold­man em­ployee will con­tra­dict the gov­ern­ment’s nar­ra­tive re­lat­ing to Gold­man’s mis­con­duct – in­clud­ing Ng’s al­leged mis­con­duct for which he is charged”.</p>
    <p>Mr Ag­nifilo ar­gues that “this cre­ates a con­sti­tu­tional is­sue in this case” by con­strain­ing Ng’s use of wit­nesses in his de­fence.</p>
    <p>Ng is out on a US$20 mil­lion bond.</p>
