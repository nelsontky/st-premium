    <p>KUALA LUMPUR • From Aug 1, peo­ple in Malaysia will be re­quired to wear face masks in pub­lic ar­eas, Se­nior Min­is­ter Is­mail Sabri Yaakob said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Those who fail to com­ply with the rul­ing can be fined or pros­e­cuted in court.</p>
    <p>Datuk Seri Is­mail Sabri said the gov­ern­ment made the de­ci­sion fol­low­ing the in­crease in Covid-19 cases in the past few days and lack of com­pli­ance with stan­dard op­er­at­ing pro­ce­dures (SOPs) by the pub­lic.</p>
    <p>The coun­try recorded dou­bledigit cases be­tween Sun­day and Wed­nes­day, af­ter weeks of mostly fewer than 10 new cases de­tected each day. The num­ber dipped slightly when Malaysia recorded nine new Covid-19 cases yes­ter­day, bring­ing the to­tal num­ber of in­fec­tions to 8,840.</p>
    <p>The Health Min­istry had pre­vi­ously ex­pected to see zero cases as early as the mid­dle of this month.</p>
    <p>“The Health Min­istry re­ported that 50 per cent of the pub­lic do not ad­here to the SOPs. Given the rise of dou­ble-digit Covid-19 cases, the gov­ern­ment has de­cided to make it (wear­ing face masks in pub­lic) com­pul­sory,” Mr Is­mail Sabri said.</p>
    <p>He said the gov­ern­ment pre­vi­ously re­frained from mak­ing the wear­ing of face masks com­pul­sory be­cause it does not want to fur­ther add fi­nan­cial strain to the lower-in­come group.</p>
    <p>This is be­cause face masks should be, ideally, changed every three hours but Mr Is­mail Sabri said that “one face mask per day is also ac­cept­able”.</p>
    <p>“The World Health Or­gan­i­sa­tion (WHO) has also said that peo­ple can make their own face masks but they have to fol­low a strict set of spec­i­fi­ca­tions. In Malaysia, the Health Min­istry will is­sue the spec­i­fi­ca­tions for home-made face masks soon,” he added.</p>
    <p>He re­minded ev­ery­one to com­ply with the SOPs, es­pe­cially in wear­ing face masks and main­tain­ing so­cial dis­tanc­ing.</p>
    <p>“Even though it is only com­pul­sory to wear face masks in pub­lic from Aug 1, peo­ple should start wear­ing them sooner, es­pe­cially those trav­el­ling in pub­lic trans­port to ‘ba­lik kam­pung’ (go­ing back to home towns) for Hari Raya” next Fri­day, he added.</p>
