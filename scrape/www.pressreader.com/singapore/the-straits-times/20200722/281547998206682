    <p>In­done­sia’s Pres­i­dent Joko Wi­dodo has signed a pres­i­den­tial reg­u­la­tion to form a na­tional Covid-19 mit­i­ga­tion and eco­nomic re­cov­ery com­mit­tee to re­sus­ci­tate the econ­omy amid a surge in new coro­n­avirus cases. The team will mon­i­tor the avail­abil­ity of test equip­ment and the de­vel­op­ment of vac­cines, among other tasks. WORLD</p>
    <p>In­done­sian Pres­i­dent Joko Wi­dodo has signed a pres­i­den­tial reg­u­la­tion to form a na­tional Covid-19 mit­i­ga­tion and eco­nomic re­cov­ery com­mit­tee to re­sus­ci­tate the econ­omy amid a surge in new cases.</p>
    <p>State-Owned En­ter­prises Min­is­ter Erick Tho­hir will head the new team, which is a merger of two former task forces. Mr Erick’s deputy Budi Gu­nadi Sadikin will con­tinue to man­age the eco­nomic task force while the disaster man­age­ment agency chief, Mr Doni Monardo, will re­main as chair of the Covid-19 mit­i­ga­tion task force.</p>
    <p>In a Face­book post yes­ter­day, Mr Joko said the new team has been tasked to deal with a num­ber of is­sues, in­clud­ing mon­i­tor­ing the avail­abil­ity of test equip­ment and the de­vel­op­ment of Covid-19 vac­cines.</p>
    <p>“With this in­te­grated team, the plan­ning and ex­e­cu­tion of pro­grammes on Covid-19 mit­i­ga­tion and eco­nomic re­cov­ery can take place si­mul­ta­ne­ously, since both ar­eas are be­ing man­aged by a sin­gle in­sti­tu­tion for max­i­mum co­or­di­na­tion,” said the Pres­i­dent, pop­u­larly known as Jokowi.</p>
    <p>As of yes­ter­day, In­done­sia has recorded 89,869 cases and 4,320 deaths, the high­est in South-east Asia and sur­pass­ing China.</p>
    <p>In­done­sia has been eas­ing re­stric­tive mea­sures un­der a “new nor­mal” but has seen record cases and fresh out­breaks in var­i­ous parts of the country as crowds gather in pub­lic places and people flout social dis­tanc­ing rules.</p>
    <p>Mr Erick on Mon­day said an in­te­grated team was needed as “we don’t want people to mis­in­ter­pret the new nor­mal term by car­ry­ing out ac­tiv­i­ties freely with­out com­ply­ing with the pro­to­cols”.</p>
    <p>He promised to de­sign poli­cies which would in­clude boost­ing people’s pur­chas­ing power, and to present them to Mr Joko next week.</p>
    <p>Pres­i­dent Joko on Mon­day dis­banded 18 state in­sti­tu­tions to re­duce the bur­den on the state bud­get as well as to stream­line bu­reau­cratic pro­cesses by hand­ing over the tasks and re­spon­si­bil­i­ties of the agen­cies to the new in­te­grated com­mit­tee and rel­e­vant min­istries.</p>
    <p>The dis­so­lu­tion fol­lowed an un­char­ac­ter­is­tic out­burst at a Cab­i­net meeting last month when he threat­ened to reshuf­fle min­is­te­rial posts and dis­band un­der­per­form­ing agen­cies if his min­is­ters failed to deal with the health cri­sis swiftly.</p>
    <p>The agen­cies in­cluded the Sunda Strait In­fra­struc­ture and Strate­gic Area De­vel­op­ment Agency which was in­tro­duced in 2011 to, among other things, over­see a shelved plan to build the 30km-long Sunda Strait Bridge con­nect­ing the is­lands of Java and Su­ma­tra.</p>
