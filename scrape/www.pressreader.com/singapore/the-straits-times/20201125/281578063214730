    <p>Sin­ga­pore’s pro-busi­ness en­vi­ron­ment has cre­ated the right con­di­tions for lo­cal com­pa­nies to thrive and for busi­nesses to use it as a base to serve the re­gion, said Mr Chan.</p>
    <p>This ecosys­tem is pos­si­ble due to fac­tors such as a ro­bust in­tel­lec­tual prop­erty pro­tec­tion regime, a skilled work­force, strong rule of law and sta­ble gov­er­nance.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore must de­velop the next gen­er­a­tion of home-grown com­pa­nies that will not only boost the lo­cal econ­omy but also com­pete in the global arena.</p>
    <p>An in­dus­try that could pro­vide fer­tile soil for such growth is the in­fo­comm me­dia (ICM) sec­tor, said Trade and In­dus­try Min­is­ter Chan Chun Sing yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>He added that this would en­tail cre­at­ing and turn­ing more home­grown firms – in­clud­ing small and medium-sized en­ter­prises (SMEs) – into suc­cess­ful global out­fits. This would ben­e­fit Sin­ga­pore­ans in the form of bet­ter job prospects and bet­ter wages.</p>
    <p>He cited Sin­ga­pore-based tech­nol­ogy firm Sea, which owns ecom­merce plat­form Shopee, as an ex­am­ple of an out­fit with a strong in­ter­na­tional foot­print, and how some fac­tors that al­low it to suc­ceed are in­stru­men­tal in how Sin­ga­pore can pro­pel its eco­nomic de­vel­op­ment.</p>
    <p>“In the ini­tial days of our in­de­pen­dence, we grew many big com­pa­nies like DBS and Sin­ga­pore Air­lines,” said Mr Chan, who was speak­ing af­ter a visit to Shopee in Sci­ence Park Drive. “Now, it comes time for us to grow another gen­er­a­tion of tech­nol­ogy com­pa­nies that can have the world as its mar­ket.”</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore’s pro-busi­ness en­vi­ron­ment has cre­ated the right con­di­tions for lo­cal com­pa­nies to thrive and for busi­nesses to use it as a base to serve the re­gion, said Mr Chan.</p>
    <p>This ecosys­tem is pos­si­ble due to fac­tors such as a ro­bust in­tel­lec­tual prop­erty pro­tec­tion regime, a skilled work­force, strong rule of law and sta­ble gov­er­nance.</p>
    <p>These are fun­da­men­tals that have put Sin­ga­pore in good stead and “we have ev­ery rea­son to be­lieve that they will con­tinue to serve us well”, he said.</p>
    <p>Be­sides the Sea group, home­grown com­pa­nies such as gam­ing chair maker Se­cret­lab and cy­ber se­cu­rity firm V-Key have seen tremen­dous growth and rep­re­sent a grow­ing new gen­er­a­tion of firms that can of­fer global mar­kets with new prod­ucts and so­lu­tions.</p>
    <p>The pres­ence of vi­brant home­grown firms across mul­ti­ple in­dus­tries will also help SMEs to grow.</p>
    <p>Mr Chan shared that larger firms can work with smaller ones, help­ing them to reach new mar­kets be­yond Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>The Shopee Univer­sity ini­tia­tive, for i nstance, helps sell­ers and SMEs to adapt their prod­ucts to the dig­i­tal plat­form and grow their on­line busi­nesses.</p>
    <p>The firm also in­tends to launch an ini­tia­tive in the first half of next year to help on­line-ready busi­nesses here ex­pand their cross-bor­der reach into Malaysia – a good start­ing point for com­pa­nies look­ing to take their first steps over­seas.</p>
    <p>The ICM sec­tor, a key en­gine of growth in Sin­ga­pore, con­trib­uted about 8 per cent of the coun­try’s gross value added and $40.7 bil­lion in nom­i­nal value added to the econ­omy last year.</p>
    <p>De­mand for more ad­vanced tech, such as au­to­ma­tion and ar­ti­fi­cial in­tel­li­gence, will con­tinue to rise in the short to medium term. On­line and dig­i­tal ser­vices, too, are likely to re­main strong rev­enue driv­ers as more in­dus­tries shift to dig­i­tal and cloud-based oper­a­tions.</p>
    <p>Mr Chan stressed that the Repub­lic is well po­si­tioned to build on the ICM sec­tor, which plays the role of a growth mul­ti­plier for other in­dus­tries.</p>
    <p>He added: “Our aim must be to use the ad­van­tages that we have to make sure that we help our com­pa­nies to grow and bulk up in size, so that they can com­pete on the in­ter­na­tional stage to de­liver bet­ter out­comes for the lo­cal SME net­work, and to de­liver a bet­ter out­come for our work­ers.”</p>
