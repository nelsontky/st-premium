    <p>• Mikel Arteta praised Arse­nal’s men­tal strength to strike late through Ed­die Nke­tiah and beat West Ham 2-1 de­spite an un­der­whelm­ing Premier League per­for­mance at the Emi­rates on Satur­day.</p>
    <p>The Gun­ners have six points af­ter two games, but were far from the stan­dards they have set un­der man­ager Arteta.</p>
    <p>Af­ter Michail An­to­nio can­celled out Alexan­dre La­cazette’s opener for the hosts, West Ham en­joyed the ma­jor­ity of the chances.</p>
    <p>An­to­nio saw a header come back off the bar, but Arse­nal were ruth­less with their chance to win the game as Dani Ce­bal­los timed his run per­fectly in be­hind the Ham­mers’ de­fence to square for Nke­tiah, who had a sim­ple tap-in.</p>
    <p>“I am re­ally happy with the three points and it’s a time to an­a­lyse prop­erly be­cause we have a lot of is­sues,” said Arteta. “What I like is the ap­proach in the last 25 min­utes when they were a bit down and then they lift it.</p>
    <p>“Prob­a­bly a few months ago, we would have drawn or lost that game and today, we win it.</p>
    <p>“You have to find a way be­cause there will be games like this through the sea­son.”</p>
    <p>Af­ter win­ning the FA Cup and Community Shield and start­ing their sea­son with a flour­ish by win­ning 3-0 at Ful­ham on the open­ing week­end, Arse­nal were ex­pected to swat aside a West Ham team who were eas­ily beaten 2-0 by New­cas­tle a week ago.</p>
    <p>But David Moyes’ men de­served some­thing to show for their per­for­mance and felt hard done by with some ref­er­ee­ing de­ci­sions.</p>
    <p>Gun­ners de­fender Gabriel ap­peared to han­dle the ball in the box, leav­ing the Scot to ques­tion the new re­vised rules on hand­ball as “we’re all un­sure”.</p>
    <p>Ce­bal­los and Nke­tiah were in­volved in a spat dur­ing the warmup at Craven Cot­tage last week, but showed there were no hard feel­ings. “We made up pretty quickly,” said Nke­tiah. “That’s what hap­pens in life... so it’s all love now.”</p>
