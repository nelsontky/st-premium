    <p>Trou­bled fi­nan­cial ser­vices provider Wire­card abruptly pulled the plug on its ser­vices yes­ter­day, ahead of the Oct 14 dead­line. Busi­nesses left in the lurch said it has been hard find­ing al­ter­na­tives with com­pet­i­tive rates.</p>
    <p>Chief Jus­tice Sun­daresh Menon has given for­mer do­mes­tic worker Parti Liyani two weeks to de­cide whether she wants to pro­ceed with her ap­pli­ca­tion to start dis­ci­plinary pro­ceed­ings against two state pros­e­cu­tors who con­ducted her trial for theft.</p>
    <p>The In­done­sian had filed the ap­pli­ca­tion in June this year, be­fore she was ac­quit­ted last month by the High Court, on ap­peal, for steal­ing from the fam­ily of prom­i­nent busi­ness­man Liew Mun Leong.</p>
    <p>The Straits Times un­der­stands that Ms Parti, 46, filed a no­tice to dis­con­tinue the case against the deputy pub­lic pros­e­cu­tors (DPPs) on Tues­day.</p>
    <p>In a cham­bers hear­ing yes­ter­day, her lawyer, Mr Anil Balchan­dani, told the Chief Jus­tice that she has been “over­whelmed by the events of the past month”.</p>
    <p>In oral grounds re­leased by the court, the Chief Jus­tice said the lawyer drew his at­ten­tion to the fact that Ms Parti, who has not been home for the last four years, wishes to be able to re­turn to In­done­sia “as soon as con­ve­niently pos­si­ble”.</p>
    <p>“This, Mr Balchan­dani ex­plained, is one of the rea­sons she had ini­tially con­sid­ered with­draw­ing the orig­i­nat­ing sum­mons seek­ing an or­der from me di­rect­ing that the mat­ters al­leged against the DPPs in ques­tion be re­ferred to a dis­ci­plinary tri­bunal for in­ves­ti­ga­tion,” said the Chief Jus­tice.</p>
    <p>How­ever, Ms Parti is “some­what torn” as she be­lieves that the DPPs should an­swer the al­le­ga­tions she has raised in her af­fi­davit.</p>
    <p>At the hear­ing, State Coun­sel Kristy Tan, for the At­tor­ney-Gen­eral’s Cham­bers (AGC), said that the DPPs in ques­tion will not ob­ject if the Chief Jus­tice refers the mat­ter for in­ves­ti­ga­tion.</p>
    <p>In a state­ment, the AGC said the two le­gal ser­vice of­fi­cers “wel­come the chance to present a full and trans­par­ent ac­count of what tran­spired dur­ing the trial” and “will co­op­er­ate fully in any inquiry”.</p>
    <p>The high-pro­file case sparked pub­lic out­cry, with ques­tions raised about the ev­i­dence-gath­er­ing process and the way in which the trial was con­ducted.</p>
    <p>Re­spond­ing to queries yes­ter­day, Law and Home Af­fairs Min­is­ter K. Shan­mugam said re­views by the po­lice and AGC are ex­pected to con­clude in two to three weeks.</p>
    <p>He added that he in­tends to make a min­is­te­rial state­ment in Par­lia­ment next month af­ter these re­views are com­pleted, and will ad­dress the ques­tions raised.</p>
    <p>Ms Parti, who worked for the Liews for nine years, was sen­tenced to 26 months in jail in March last year af­ter she was found guilty of steal­ing $34,000 worth of items from the fam­ily.</p>
    <p>She ap­pealed against her con­vic­tion in a three-day hear­ing that took place be­tween Novem­ber last year and Au­gust this year.</p>
    <p>In June, Ms Parti filed a com­plaint against Deputy Pub­lic Pros­e­cu­tors Tan Wee Hao and Tan Yany­ing.</p>
    <p>Mr Balchan­dani was ap­pointed to act for her in re­la­tion to the com­plaint in July.</p>
    <p>The AGC later filed an ap­pli­ca­tion seek­ing to be heard and to sub­mit ma­te­ri­als re­lated to the case.</p>
    <p>One of the is­sues raised by High Court judge Chan Seng Onn in his judg­ment re­lated to a demon­stra­tion car­ried out by the DPPs on a DVD player, which Ms Parti said she was al­lowed to take as it was spoilt. Dur­ing the trial, the DPPs</p>
    <p>RE­VIEWS IN PROGRESS</p>
    <p>Re­views by the po­lice and the AGC (At­tor­ney-Gen­eral’s Cham­bers) are still in progress, and are ex­pected to con­clude in two to three weeks’ time. I in­tend to make a min­is­te­rial state­ment in Par­lia­ment in Novem­ber, af­ter these re­views are com­pleted, and will ad­dress the ques­tions that have been raised.</p>
    <p>showed Ms Parti that the de­vice could play a video dig­i­tally stored in the hard disk. How­ever, dur­ing the ap­peal, it was shown that the de­vice could not play DVDs.</p>
    <p>Jus­tice Chan said if the prose­cu­tion had known of this de­fect, it</p>
    <p>should have fully dis­closed it. If not, the trial court could be mis­led into think­ing that the player was in good work­ing con­di­tion when ques­tions were put to Ms Parti, he said.</p>
