    <p>The stay-clean ad­vice is not just im­por­tant to fight Covid-19, but it is also a use­ful re­minder as peo­ple head out amid re­laxed curbs. The Na­tional En­vi­ron­ment Agency stressed the im­por­tance of main­tain­ing hy­giene. This comes after four peo­ple de­vel­oped skin ir­ri­ta­tion fol­low­ing a trip to two beaches in Sen­tosa.</p>
    <p>The stay-clean ad­vice is not just im­por­tant to guard against Covid-19 in­fec­tions, it is a use­ful re­minder as peo­ple head out amid re­laxed mea­sures.</p>
    <p>The Na­tional En­vi­ron­ment Agency (NEA) stressed the im­por­tance of main­tain­ing hy­giene, even at beaches.</p>
    <p>“Beach users are ad­vised to reg­u­larly wash their hands, avoid swim­ming or wad­ing in bod­ies of wa­ter with open wounds, and shower after ex­po­sure to marine wa­ter,” said the agency.</p>
    <p>The re­minder comes after four peo­ple de­vel­oped skin ir­ri­ta­tion fol­low­ing two sep­a­rate trips to two beaches on Sen­tosa.</p>
    <p>They were in­fected by staphy­lo­coc­cus au­reus (staph), a harm­less and com­mon bac­terium found on the skin and nos­trils of three out of ev­ery 10 peo­ple and in the en­vi­ron­ment.</p>
    <p>Usu­ally it causes mi­nor ir­ri­ta­tion in an in­fected per­son.</p>
    <p>But for Ms Elisse, 37, and her fam­ily, it needed a visit on July 23 to the Na­tional Univer­sity Hos­pi­tal for in­ci­sion and drainage surgery to re­move pus out of wounds that had be­come in­fected. They were hos­pi­talised from July 23 to 26.</p>
    <p>The Sin­ga­porean, who de­clined to have her full name pub­lished, said pus had col­lected on her calf, and in her hus­band’s fin­ger, as well as on the calf of one of her 14-month-old daugh­ters. She has a pair of twin girls and an 11-year-old boy.</p>
    <p>It hap­pened after a trip to Tan­jong Beach on Sen­tosa last month.</p>
    <p>A few weeks later, they learnt that their neigh­bour’s five-year-old son had de­vel­oped a $1 coin-size itchy boil be­low his knee.</p>
    <p>The boy had spent Aug 4 at Palawan Beach’s Hy­droDash – a float­ing ob­sta­cle course.</p>
    <p>The Straits Times con­tacted the neigh­bour, a 43-year-old phar­ma­cist who did not want to be iden­ti­fied. She said her son’s doc­tor sus­pected that the boil was caused by a staph in­fec­tion.</p>
    <p>It is still un­clear how they were in­fected.</p>
    <p>The bac­terium can be passed by an in­fected per­son to an­other party, but it is also a com­mon cause of food poi­son­ing and can be left on sur­faces.</p>
    <p>Ms Elisse sus­pects that they may have caught the bug at the beach, ei­ther in the sand or the wa­ter.</p>
    <p>NEA said waters around Sin­ga­pore are not checked for the staph bac­terium and the World Health Or­gan­i­sa­tion (WHO) is­sues no such guide­lines. Ex­perts say this is be­cause the bac­terium is com­mon and largely harm­less.</p>
    <p>The WHO does men­tion, how­ever, that staph may be found on the sands of pop­u­lar beaches due to ac­tiv­ity by beach-go­ers, NEA added.</p>
    <p>The wa­ter qual­ity at seven beaches in Sin­ga­pore, in­clud­ing Sen­tosa, is mon­i­tored weekly for en­te­ro­coc­cus – a harm­ful bac­terium found in an­i­mal and hu­man fae­ces.</p>
    <p>The agency said en­te­ro­coc­cus counts last month were within WHO guide­lines for pri­mary con­tact ac­tiv­i­ties such as swim­ming. So what caused the in­fec­tions? As­so­ciate Pro­fes­sor Hsu Li Yang, an in­fec­tious dis­eases doc­tor at the Na­tional Univer­sity of Sin­ga­pore’s Saw Swee Hock School of Pub­lic Health, said: “The fam­ily mem­bers may have al­ready car­ried the staph bac­terium, and mi­cro-in­juries sus­tained then led to the in­fec­tions.”</p>
    <p>Dr Leong Hoe Nam, an in­fec­tious dis­eases spe­cial­ist at Mount El­iz­a­beth Novena Hos­pi­tal, said mem­bers of the fam­ily may have had the ill­ness spread among them­selves by con­tact.</p>
    <p>Ms Elisse said she did have a small mos­quito bite be­hind her right calf, and her hus­band had a small cut or scratch on his fin­ger. Both wounds turned into ab­scesses later.</p>
    <p>While staph can sur­vive in salt wa­ter, es­pe­cially in warm seas, Dr Shawn Va­soo said there have been lim­ited reports of the pathogen be­ing found in the sand and in coastal waters. The clin­i­cal di­rec­tor of the Na­tional Cen­tre for In­fec­tious Dis­eases added: “Per­son­ally, I have not come across pa­tients who’ve ac­quired it from beach or sea­wa­ter ex­po­sure.”</p>
    <p>A spokesman for Sen­tosa De­vel­op­ment Cor­po­ra­tion said that the island’s beaches have seen be­tween 200 and 1,000 visi­tors daily, since their re­open­ing in June at the start of phase two.</p>

        <p data-role="text">Palawan Beach (above) was one of the beaches in Sen&#xAD;tosa vis&#xAD;ited by peo&#xAD;ple who de&#xAD;vel&#xAD;oped skin ir&#xAD;ri&#xAD;ta&#xAD;tion af&#xAD;ter&#xAD;wards. The Na&#xAD;tional En&#xAD;vi&#xAD;ron&#xAD;ment Agency ad&#xAD;vises beach users to reg&#xAD;u&#xAD;larly wash their hands, avoid en&#xAD;ter&#xAD;ing the wa&#xAD;ter if they have open wounds, and shower after ex&#xAD;po&#xAD;sure to marine wa&#xAD;ter.</p>

        <p data-role="text">A 37-year-old Sin&#xAD;ga&#xAD;porean woman, who wants to be known only as Ms Elisse, says pus-filled ab&#xAD;scesses de&#xAD;vel&#xAD;oped on her 14-month-old daugh&#xAD;ter&#x2019;s leg (from left), in the mid&#xAD;dle fin&#xAD;ger of her hus&#xAD;band&#x2019;s left hand and on her own right calf, after she and her fam&#xAD;ily vis&#xAD;ited Tan&#xAD;jong Beach on Sen&#xAD;tosa on July 12. Anal&#xAD;y&#xAD;sis of the pus sam&#xAD;ples de&#xAD;tected the pres&#xAD;ence of the staph bac&#xAD;terium. Ms Elisse said her hus&#xAD;band al&#xAD;most lost his fin&#xAD;ger to the in&#xAD;fec&#xAD;tion.</p>
