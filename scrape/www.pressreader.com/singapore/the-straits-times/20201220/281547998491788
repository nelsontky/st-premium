    <p>Thirteen served their Covid-19 stay-home cases no­tice who (SHN) at Man­darin Or­chard Sin­ga­pore ho­tel are be­ing in­ves­ti­gated by the Min­istry of Health af­ter it emerged that they could be linked.</p>
    <p>Here is what hap­pens when trav­ellers serve their SHN.</p>
    <p>1 BE­FORE AR­RIVAL IN SIN­GA­PORE</p>
    <p>All trav­ellers must sub­mit a pre­trip health and travel his­tory dec­la­ra­tion be­fore ar­riv­ing here.</p>
    <p>Those who are not Sin­ga­pore cit­i­zens or per­ma­nent res­i­dents (PRs) need en­try ap­proval from gov­ern­ment agen­cies or cer­tain travel passes to en­ter Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>De­pend­ing on a per­son’s travel his­tory, they will need to com­ply with dif­fer­ent re­quire­ments.</p>
    <p>Some will need a neg­a­tive re­sult for an ap­proved Covid-19 swab test taken within 72 hours be­fore de­par­ture.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore­ans and PRs do not need to take a Covid-19 poly­merase chain re­ac­tion (PCR) test be­fore re­turn­ing here.</p>
    <p>2 AR­RIVAL IN SIN­GA­PORE</p>
    <p>On ar­rival, most trav­ellers will re­ceive an SHN or an elec­tronic mon­i­tor­ing de­vice, or both, dur­ing im­mi­gra­tion clear­ance. The SHN du­ra­tion can be ei­ther seven days or 14 days. Those ar­riv­ing from a lim­ited list of coun­tries, in­clud­ing Brunei and Aus­tralia, are al­lowed to take a swab test on ar­rival.</p>
    <p>They will have to self-iso­late while wait­ing for their re­sults and do not need to serve an SHN.</p>
    <p>3 FROM AIR­PORT TO SHN FA­CIL­I­TIES</p>
    <p>Some trav­ellers from places such as Ma­cau can choose to opt out of serv­ing their SHN in ded­i­cated fa­cil­i­ties and choose to serve it at their own ac­com­mo­da­tion. They must meet cri­te­ria such as oc­cu­py­ing the ac­com­mo­da­tion alone or only with house­hold mem­bers with the same travel his­tory.</p>
    <p>Oth­ers will be al­lo­cated ded­i­cated SHN fa­cil­i­ties by of­fi­cers at the im­mi­gra­tion check­point.</p>
    <p>Trans­porta­tion will be ar­ranged to take them to th­ese fa­cil­i­ties di­rectly from the air­port.</p>
    <p>Staff at Changi Air­port who come into close con­tact with pas­sen­gers don full per­sonal pro­tec­tive equip­ment and are rou­tinely tested for Covid-19.</p>
    <p>4 SERV­ING SHN</p>
    <p>Ho­tels used as SHN ded­i­cated fa­cil­i­ties need to have strict pro­to­cols to sep­a­rate those on SHN from other guests.</p>
    <p>Th­ese in­clude plac­ing them in seg­re­gated blocks, wings or floors as well as en­sur­ing the routes they use to get around are clearly sep­a­rated from that of other guests.</p>
    <p>In­di­vid­u­als on SHN can­not leave their rooms dur­ing their stay, and rooms are thor­oughly dis­in­fected and sani­tised af­ter they leave.</p>
    <p>Th­ese peo­ple can­not ac­cess com­mon fa­cil­i­ties in the ho­tels too.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing their SHN, trav­ellers will have to take a Covid-19 swab test.</p>
    <p>To avoid con­tact with other peo­ple, they have their own room and toi­let each, with meals pro­vided to them.</p>
    <p>The Im­mi­gra­tion and Check­points Author­ity will also con­duct checks on trav­ellers placed on SHN through house vis­its, calls or via What­sApp.</p>
