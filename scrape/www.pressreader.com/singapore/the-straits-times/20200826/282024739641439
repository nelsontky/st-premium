    <p>From Friday, Sin­ga­pore trav­ellers to China will have to take a Covid-19 test within five days be­fore their flight to the coun­try, to en­sure they are free of the coronaviru­s.</p>
    <p>They must also de­clare that, in the last 14 days, they have not had a fever at or above 37.3 deg C, and have not been in con­tact with pa­tients with a fever or res­pi­ra­tory symp­toms, among other things.</p>
    <p>These de­tails were an­nounced by the Chi­nese Em­bassy here on its web­site last Friday.</p>
    <p>In June, Sin­ga­pore and China an­nounced a “fast lane” agree­ment that al­lows trav­ellers from both sides to fly into each other’s coun­tries with­out serv­ing a quar­an­tine pe­riod of up to 14 days.</p>
    <p>In­stead, trav­ellers must take a Covid-19 swab test 48 hours be­fore de­par­ture and af­ter they land. Last Friday’s state­ment by the Chi­nese Em­bassy here spells out de­tails and the pa­per­work re­quired.</p>
    <p>The em­bassy added on Monday that the test re­quire­ment has been or will be im­ple­mented in over 80 coun­tries, fol­low­ing dif­fer­ing in­ter­pre­ta­tions of the orig­i­nal an­nounce­ment.</p>
    <p>The test also came un­der the spot­light af­ter lo­cal bud­get car­rier Scoot ac­ci­den­tally sent a mass email to cus­tomers yes­ter­day say­ing that they must take a Covid-19 test be­fore trav­el­ling to China.</p>
    <p>The e-mail was in­tended for pas­sen­gers on Scoot Flight TR100, which is de­part­ing for Guangzhou on Sun­day, but was sent to other cus­tomers who have trav­elled with Scoot in the past, or have fu­ture book­ings with the car­rier.</p>
    <p>Scoot apol­o­gised for the mis­take and said it arose from a hu­man er­ror, and not a data se­cu­rity or hack­ing in­ci­dent.</p>
    <p>For the Covid-19 test, the Chi­nese Em­bassy said that at this stage, it does not des­ig­nate spe­cific in­sti­tu­tions to carry out the test. Pas­sen­gers can choose any hos­pi­tal or clinic listed on the Sin­ga­pore Min­istry of Health’s web­site.</p>
    <p>Af­ter they have tested neg­a­tive for Covid-19, pas­sen­gers must email their test re­sult to­gether with a scanned copy of a signed health dec­la­ra­tion form and a pho­to­copy of the bio­data page of their pass­port to the Chi­nese Em­bassy.</p>
    <p>The em­bassy said it will take at least one work­ing day to ver­ify the doc­u­ments. More de­tails can be found on the em­bassy’s web­site at www.chi­naem­bassy.org.sg/eng/</p>
    <p>For the Guangzhou flight pas­sen­gers who need to take the Covid-19 test, Scoot said in its e-mail that they must take it by today – between 9am and 10.30am at a re­gional screen­ing cen­tre at the for­mer Shuqun Sec­ondary School in Jurong East – if they do not have a sched­uled test.</p>
    <p>Pas­sen­gers tak­ing the test at the cen­tre must pay $186 be­fore their test re­sults can be re­leased to them.</p>
