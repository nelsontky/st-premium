    <p>• A mil­i­tary plane crash in Ukraine killed 26 peo­ple, a tragedy which Pres­i­dent Volodymyr Ze­len­sky said would be in­ves­ti­gated promptly and im­par­tially.</p>
    <p>The trans­port plane car­ry­ing air force cadets on Friday crashed and burst into flames near a high­way in the coun­try’s north-east.</p>
    <p>The State Emer­gency Ser­vice of Ukraine said 27 peo­ple had been on board the plane – seven crew mem­bers and 20 stu­dents. Only one cadet man­aged to sur­vive.</p>
    <p>“Yes­ter­day, as a re­sult of a ter­ri­ble tragedy... Ukraine lost 26 of its wor­thy sons,” Mr Ze­len­sky said in a post on Face­book yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>“I in­sist that the causes of this plane crash be promptly clar­i­fied and that the in­ves­ti­ga­tion be ob­jec­tive and im­par­tial.”</p>
    <p>He also de­clared yes­ter­day a day of mourn­ing.</p>
    <p>The Antonov An-26 air­craft crashed while try­ing to land dur­ing a train­ing ex­er­cise, Ukraine’s De­fence Min­istry said, adding that the black boxes with flight data had been found.</p>
    <p>The Ukrainian au­thor­i­ties said they were in­ves­ti­gat­ing four pos­si­ble causes of the crash – a tech­ni­cal mal­func­tion in­volv­ing the air­craft; im­proper per­for­mance by the crew; im­proper per­for­mance by flight con­trol; and in­ad­e­quate main­te­nance.</p>
    <p>The State Se­cu­rity Ser­vice, a law en­force­ment agency, said the twinengine plane crashed five min­utes af­ter the crew com­man­der asked to land, fol­low­ing the fail­ure of the left en­gine.</p>
    <p>The crash hap­pened around 2km from a mil­i­tary air­port. The cadets were from the Kharkiv Uni­ver­sity of the Air Force, which is run by the de­fence min­istry. The gov­ern­ment said train­ing flights on sim­i­lar types of air­craft have been sus­pended.</p>
    <p>Many Ukraini­ans mourned the vic­tims of the tragedy on so­cial me­dia. The US em­bassy in Ukraine wrote on Face­book: “We send our heart­felt con­do­lences to the fam­i­lies and loved ones of the cadets, of­fi­cers, and crew killed and in­jured in the An-26 plane crash.”</p>
