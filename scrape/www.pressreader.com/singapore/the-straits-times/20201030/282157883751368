    <p>The Mon­e­tary Au­thor­ity of Sin­ga­pore (MAS) pro­vided a sober­ing assess­ment of the state of the Sin­ga­pore econ­omy, which is in the throes of a re­ces­sion that is likely to be unusu­ally deep and pro­tracted. In the Oc­to­ber edi­tion of its macroe­co­nomic re­view, the MAS pointed out that the re­ces­sion is also atyp­i­cal. Peak-to-trough de­clines in real pri­vate con­sump­tion ex­ports, im­ports and pri­vate in­vest­ment have been sharper than usual and the drop in em­ploy­ment has been big­ger. Re­cov­ery from the se­cond quar­ter has also been patchy. Some sec­tors are less af­fected, in­clud­ing man­u­fac­tur­ing, whole­sale trade, parts of trans­port, in­for­ma­tion and com­mu­ni­ca­tions tech­nol­ogy, fi­nan­cial ser­vices and some do­mes­tic ser­vices, which col­lec­tively ac­count for about 63 per cent of gross do­mes­tic prod­uct (GDP). At the other end of the spec­trum are the worst-hit sec­tors, in­clud­ing travel-re­lated in­dus­tries; some con­sumer-fac­ing sec­tors like food ser­vices, re­tail and land trans­port; and con­struc­tion. Al­though they ac­count for 12 per cent of GDP, they have in­di­rect spillovers on the econ­omy. More­over, some, such as travel-re­lated sec­tors, may face pro­longed head­winds till 2022.</p>
    <p>Look­ing for­ward, the MAS noted that al­though the GDP growth fore­cast for this year re­mains un­changed at mi­nus 7 per cent to mi­nus 5 per cent, there are down­side risks. Ex­ter­nally, a resur­gence of in­fec­tions in some ad­vanced economies – which has al­ready hap­pened in Europe and Amer­ica – could trans­late into weaker-than-ex­pected re­cov­ery in ex­ter­nal de­mand. Do­mes­ti­cally, some of the third-quar­ter re­bound in con­sumer-fac­ing sec­tors could ta­per off in the next quar­ter, as pent-up de­mand gets ex­hausted, tourist ar­rivals stay low, house­holds curb dis­cre­tionary spend­ing and firm clo­sures ac­cel­er­ate as wage sub­si­dies ta­per off.</p>
    <p>On the jobs front, the MAS cau­tions that while re­trench­ments have been tem­pered by wage sub­si­dies, re­liefs on for­eign worker levies and some job cre­ation in sec­tors with brighter prospects, em­ploy­ment will be slow to come back. Some sec­tors will re­main trou­bled, firms may hire less in the ab­sence of wage sub­si­dies and there may be more labour sup­ply as trainees un­der the SGUnited Jobs and Skills Pack­age look for jobs and those who left the labour mar­ket re-en­ter.</p>
    <p>What this over­all prog­no­sis sug­gests is that not­with­stand­ing the close to $100 bil­lion in bud­getary spend­ing and record deficits, fis­cal sup­port will con­tinue to be needed well into next year. It can be less broad-based and more tar­geted at lag­ging sec­tors. It will need to be com­ple­mented by con­tin­ued sub­si­dies for train­ing as well as more au­to­matic and less ad-hoc sup­port for the unem­ployed. Loan sub­si­dies and eq­uity in­jec­tions into se­lected com­pa­nies may also be needed. In short, deal­ing with the Covid-19 re­ces­sion is shap­ing up to be a marathon bat­tle that will con­tinue to need un­con­ven­tional pol­icy in­ter­ven­tions.</p>
