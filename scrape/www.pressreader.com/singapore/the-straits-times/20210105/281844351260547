    <p>In­dia’s in­dige­nously pro­duced Covid-19 vac­cine is at the cen­tre of a con­tro­versy af­ter it was li­censed with clin­i­cal tri­als for ef­fec­tive­ness still in­com­plete.</p>
    <p>Co­vaxin was granted emer­gency ap­proval on Sun­day by the In­dian drug reg­u­la­tor. Also get­ting the nod was As­traZeneca-Ox­ford Univer­sity’s Co­vishield, to be made in In­dia by Serum In­sti­tute, the world’s largest vac­cine pro­ducer by vol­ume.</p>
    <p>The de­ci­sion to ap­prove Co­vaxin, de­vel­oped and man­u­fac­tured by Hy­der­abad-based Bharat</p>
    <p>Biotech, trig­gered a row. The In­dian health min­is­ter said it was granted per­mis­sion for “re­stricted use in emer­gency sit­u­a­tions” in the “larger pub­lic in­ter­est”.</p>
    <p>The In­dian drug reg­u­la­tor said Co­vaxin’s in­ac­ti­vated virus for­mu­la­tion would be ef­fec­tive pro­tec­tion against mu­tant strains.</p>
    <p>Health ex­perts, how­ever, said there was no data in the pub­lic do­main to sup­port any such claims.</p>
    <p>Co­vaxin has com­pleted only two of three re­quired phases of clin­i­cal tri­als. The first two en­sured that the drug is safe. The third one that tests for ef­fi­cacy be­gan only in late Novem­ber.</p>
    <p>Dr Ga­gan­deep Kang, vice-chair of the board of Coali­tion for Epi­demic Pre­pared­ness In­no­va­tions, a global part­ner­ship seek­ing to de­velop vac­cines, said she had seen noth­ing like this ap­proval be­fore.</p>
    <p>“This is hy­po­thet­i­cal at best,” she told CNBC-TV18.</p>
    <p>On Sun­day, Serum In­sti­tute chief ex­ec­u­tive Adar Poon­awalla told In­dian chan­nel NDTV: “There are only three vac­cines with proven ef­fi­cacy – Pfizer, Moderna and Ox­ford/As­traZeneca. Ev­ery­thing else has been proven to be safe, just like wa­ter.”</p>
    <p>Serum In­sti­tute’s Co­vishield has com­pleted all three trial phases.</p>
    <p>The In­dian govern­ment ap­proved it based on As­traZeneca’s in­terim data from the Bri­tish trial, which showed 70.42 per cent ef­fi­cacy, al­though there were doubts about dosages given.</p>
    <p>In a vir­tual press meet­ing yes­ter­day, Bharat Biotech chair­man</p>
    <p>Kr­ishna Ella slammed crit­ics. “We are a global com­pany op­er­at­ing in 12 coun­tries, in­clud­ing the US and UK, and have a proven track record of 16 vac­cines,” in­clud­ing for the Zika virus, ty­phoid, chikun­gunya and ro­tavirus, he added.</p>
    <p>“Why are In­dian com­pa­nies and sci­en­tists bashed? If other com­pa­nies can get ap­provals based on just 100 peo­ple’s data, why not me?” He was re­fer­ring to Co­vishield’s data sub­mit­ted to the In­dian reg­u­la­tor.</p>
    <p>Asked if Co­vaxin’s ap­proval was pre­ma­ture, he quoted the health min­istry’s clin­i­cal trial rules that al­low ac­cel­er­ated au­tho­ri­sa­tion for vac­cines based on “re­mark­able ef­fi­cacy” shown in phase two tri­als.</p>
    <p>He said Co­vaxin was li­censed based on its ef­fi­cacy in tri­als in­volv­ing an­i­mals, proven “plat­form tech­nol­ogy” (the man­u­fac­tur­ing mech­a­nism) and ro­bust im­mune re­sponses to mul­ti­ple vi­ral pro­teins in the 375 and 380 peo­ple who got two doses in the first two phases.</p>
    <p>In the past month, many sites con­duct­ing the Co­vaxin tri­als ad­mit­ted to de­lays due to short­ages of vol­un­teers. Ban­ga­lore’s Vy­dehi In­sti­tute of Med­i­cal Sciences and Re­search Cen­tre aimed to ad­min­is­ter the first dose to 1,000 peo­ple but only about 500 turned up.</p>
    <p>In Bhopal, ac­tivist Rachna Dhin­gra al­leged about 700 peo­ple were ad­min­is­tered the first dose of Co­vaxin with­out in­formed con­sent.</p>
    <p>They are from poor neigh­bour­hoods ad­ja­cent to Peo­ple’s Hos­pi­tal, which is run­ning the trial, and many said they were told they were get­ting the vac­cine, not the trial vac­cine.</p>
    <p>The in­ves­ti­ga­tor at the Bhopal hos­pi­tal re­fused to an­swer ques­tions, and Bharat Biotech’s me­dia ad­viser said the com­pany was not aware of the de­vel­op­ments.</p>
    <p>Ex­perts fear hasty ap­provals, in­com­plete tri­als and a lack of trans­parency could dis­cour­age peo­ple from get­ting vac­ci­nated. A sci­en­tist in Ban­ga­lore ad­mit­ted: “I for one will skip vac­ci­na­tion.”</p>
