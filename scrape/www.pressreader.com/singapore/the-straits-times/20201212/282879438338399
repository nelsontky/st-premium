    <p>Du­cati’s 2021 Monster (above) is pow­ered by a 937cc Tes­tas­tretta L-twin en­gine. With the in­creased dis­place­ment from 821cc, the bike now has 111hp (up from 109cc).</p>
    <p>The bike’s alu­minium frame has also re­duced over­all dry weight to just 166kg – 18kg lighter than the Monster 821.</p>
    <p>Hot on the heels of BMW’s facelifted 5-se­ries is the re­freshed Mercedes-Benz E-class (above). With a re­designed grille, front head­lamps (now full-LED) and tail-lamps, the car now looks more like the C-class.</p>
    <p>In­side, it boasts new driv­ing aids, which in­clude adap­tive cruise con­trol with route-based speed ad­just­ment, ac­tive blindspot as­sist with exit warn­ing, au­to­mated park­ing and widescreen cock­pit with two 12.3-inch dis­plays. The more modern car should now ap­peal to the younger crowd.</p>
    <p>Porsche, Siemens to make syn­thetic petrol</p>
    <p>Siemens En­ergy and Porsche are team­ing up to make syn­thetic petrol which they say is “cli­mateneu­tral”.</p>
    <p>The first plant is in Chile, with the first batches to be used ini­tially on race cour­ses and in ve­hi­cle tri­als. In fu­ture, it could also be for Porsche’s pro­duc­tion sports cars.</p>
    <p>In the pilot phase, around 130,000 litres of the so-called efuel will be pro­duced as early as 2022.</p>
    <p>In two fur­ther phases, ca­pac­ity will in­crease to about 55 mil­lion litres a year by 2024 and around 550 mil­lion litres by 2026.</p>
    <p>Porsche will be the pri­mary cus­tomer for the green fuel. Siemens En­ergy will get a gov­ern­ment grant of some €8 mil­lion (S$13 mil­lion) for this project.</p>
    <p>Mak­ing liq­uid fu­els from gas, coal or biomass has long been a niche in­dus­try which has yet to be com­mer­cially vi­able.</p>
