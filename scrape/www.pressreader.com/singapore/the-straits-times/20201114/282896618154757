    <p>I have had this ZZ plant (left) for about 15 years. About three years ago, it pro­duced a flower which died very fast, in three to four days. Re­cently, I found a sim­i­lar “flower”. Is it a real bloom? What kind of con­di­tions does the plant need for it to thrive and flower?</p>
    <p>An­ge­line Pang</p>
    <p>Your ZZ plant (Zamiocul­cas za­mi­ifo­lia) is pro­duc­ing a spe­cial struc­ture called an in­flo­res­cence, where the cen­tral rod-like spadix is the part that holds nu­mer­ous small flow­ers.</p>
    <p>This plant sel­dom flow­ers and, from my past ob­ser­va­tions of plants grown by other gar­den­ers, it ap­pears that it flow­ers only when it is se­verely pot-bound.</p>
    <p>Your ZZ plant ap­pears to be pot­bound, where the roots have all filled the pot.</p>
    <p>The flow­er­ing may be a re­sponse to the stress that it is ex­pe­ri­enc­ing in a very con­fined si­t­u­a­tion.</p>
    <p>The plant may not have as many leaves as be­fore.</p>
    <p>It is rec­om­mended you move the plant to a larger pot for it to grow.</p>
