    <p>The Na­tional Parks Board (NParks) has said it will con­tinue to mon­i­tor re­ports of sight­ings of box jel­ly­fish in Sin­ga­pore wa­ters.</p>
    <p>But it has no plans to is­sue noswim­ming or­ders for now, al­though it has put up ad­vi­sories on the is­sue on its web­site and in coastal ar­eas.</p>
    <p>Dr Karenne Tun, di­rec­tor of the coastal and marine di­vi­sion at NParks’ Na­tional Bio­di­ver­sity Cen­tre, said there had been four con­firmed sight­ings of box jel­ly­fish since March – at East Coast Park, One De­gree 15 Ma­rina Sen­tosa Cove, Sen­tosa’s Siloso Beach and Pu­lau Seringat.</p>
    <p>In re­sponse to queries from The Straits Times yes­ter­day, Dr Tun said: “There are cur­rently no plans to is­sue a no-swim­ming or­der for the NParks-man­aged coastal ar­eas since there have not been any re­cent sight­ings in these ar­eas.”</p>
    <p>Coastal ar­eas that NParks over­sees in­clude East Coast Park and Pu­lau Ubin.</p>
    <p>The lat­est sight­ing was re­ported in the wa­ters off Siloso Beach last Fri­day and Sen­tosa De­vel­op­ment Cor­po­ra­tion (SDC), which over­sees the re­sort is­land where the beach is lo­cated, im­me­di­ately re­stricted en­try into the wa­ters there un­til fur­ther no­tice. Reg­u­lar sur­veil­lance of the beaches and wa­ters on Sen­tosa has also been stepped up since last Fri­day.</p>
    <p>The box jel­ly­fish is one of the dead­li­est crea­tures on the planet. Among the 50 or so types are some that can cause ag­o­nis­ing pain and even death.</p>
    <p>NParks has also been work­ing with re­searchers from the Na­tional Univer­sity of Sin­ga­pore (NUS) to col­lect water sam­ples from var­i­ous coastal ar­eas to run en­vi­ron­men­tal DNA anal­y­sis, which will help to de­tect the pres­ence of the species here.</p>
    <p>NUS marine bi­ol­o­gist Huang Dan­wei, who is part of the re­search team, said it is too early to con­firm the type of jel­ly­fish that was spotted last Fri­day.</p>
    <p>He dis­closed that re­searchers had con­ducted tests for en­vi­ron­men­tal DNA of the Mor­bakka box jel­ly­fish species, which was sighted in March and July, on water sam­ples from Sen­tosa and Sis­ters’ Is­lands Marine Park.</p>
    <p>“The sam­ples have tested neg­a­tive, sug­gest­ing that it re­mains rare in the en­vi­ron­ment, even at sites where it has been spotted re­cently,” he said.</p>
    <p>“We are cur­rently de­vel­op­ing newer ap­proaches to de­tect a suite of jel­ly­fish species, in­clud­ing the species which was found at Siloso Beach at the week­end.”</p>
    <p>SDC said that in ad­di­tion to last Fri­day’s in­ci­dent, there were two other con­firmed box jel­ly­fish sight­ings on the is­land this year – at Palawan Beach on July 17 and One De­gree 15 Ma­rina Sen­tosa Cove on July 3.</p>
    <p>SDC’s beach pa­trol of­fi­cers re­ceived 37 re­ports of jel­ly­fish sight­ing and stings this year, but none was at­trib­uted to the box jel­ly­fish, said an SDC spokesman yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>“As var­i­ous other species of jel­ly­fish are also com­mon in Sin­ga­pore’s wa­ters, we urge our guests to be vig­i­lant and take the nec­es­sary pre­cau­tions when swim­ming at the beach, such as leav­ing as lit­tle skin ex­posed as pos­si­ble, and wear­ing a flota­tion de­vice such as a safety buoy or life jacket,” the spokesman said.</p>
    <p>A spokesman for con­ser­va­tion group Marine Ste­wards has also spo­ken about a spike in the num­ber of box jel­ly­fish sight­ings around the south­ern is­lands, in­clud­ing Sen­tosa and Lazarus Is­land.</p>
    <p>Eight sight­ings were re­ported in July, the spokesman said.</p>
    <p>At least two peo­ple have been stung by box jel­ly­fish this year. The first re­ported case was in March when Aus­tralian Jade Dyson, 28, was stung while swim­ming at East Coast Park.</p>
    <p>On July 17, a four-year-old girl was stung at Palawan Beach while pad­dling in shal­low wa­ters.</p>
    <p>To­gether with com­mu­nity group Friends of Marine Park, NParks has alerted academia and those in the boat­ing and recre­ational arena, as well as agen­cies whose staff work in and around coastal wa­ters, to the box jel­ly­fish sight­ings this year.</p>
    <p>Sight­ings of the species have been re­ported here since the 1950s.</p>
    <p>Ex­perts say it is too early to con­clude that more box jel­ly­fish are swim­ming in our wa­ters.</p>
    <p>Mr Ni­cholas Yap, a PhD can­di­date at NUS’ Reef Ecol­ogy Lab­o­ra­tory, said: “In­creased sight­ings are likely due to greater aware­ness and in­ter­est by the pub­lic, and with more peo­ple fre­quent­ing these pub­lic wa­ters this year.”</p>
    <p>He added that there is lit­tle data on box jel­ly­fish and their oc­cur­rence here to ac­count for the in­creased sight­ings this year.</p>
    <p>“It is pos­si­ble that what we are ex­pe­ri­enc­ing this year may be nor­mal on a time scale that we have yet to un­der­stand. Speciesspe­cific jel­ly­fish oc­cur­rence cy­cles can vary an­nu­ally to even 10-yearly,” he said.</p>
