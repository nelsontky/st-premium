    <p>A fresh group of 47 em­ploy­ers have been placed on the Fair Con­sid­er­a­tion Frame­work watch list for po­ten­tially dis­crim­i­na­tory hir­ing prac­tices. They will have their Em­ploy­ment Pass ap­pli­ca­tions closely scru­ti­nised, and those who are re­cal­ci­trant or un­co­op­er­a­tive will have their work pass priv­i­leges cut back.</p>
    <p>A fresh group of 47 em­ploy­ers have been placed on the Fair Con­sid­er­a­tion Frame­work (FCF) watch list for po­ten­tially dis­crim­i­na­tory hir­ing prac­tices.</p>
    <p>They will have their Em­ploy­ment Pass (EP) ap­pli­ca­tions for for­eign hires closely scru­ti­nised, and those who are re­cal­ci­trant or un­co­op­er­a­tive will have their work pass priv­i­leges cut back.</p>
    <p>The 47 are on top of 1,200 em­ploy­ers pre­vi­ously put on the watch list, said the Min­istry of Man­power (MOM) yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Its up­date comes amid con­cerns from lo­cal job seek­ers that they are not get­ting a fair deal in a tough job mar­ket, and that some em­ploy­ers are bi­ased against Sin­ga­pore­ans.</p>
    <p>Of the new­com­ers, 18 have for­eign­ers com­pris­ing more than half of their pro­fes­sional, man­ager, ex­ec­u­tive and tech­ni­cian (PMET) work­force. In ad­di­tion, 30 of the em­ploy­ers from the fi­nan­cial and pro­fes­sional ser­vice sec­tors have a high con­cen­tra­tion of PMETs from sin­gle na­tion­al­i­ties.</p>
    <p>These prac­tices are a se­ri­ous con­cern amid the Covid-19 pan­demic, given that the over­all un­em­ploy­ment rate rose to 2.9 per cent last month, the high­est in more than a decade.</p>
    <p>The FCF was in­tro­duced in 2014 to main­tain a strong Sin­ga­porean core in PMET jobs, and sets out re­quire­ments for em­ploy­ers to con­sider the lo­cal work­force fairly for job op­por­tu­ni­ties.</p>
    <p>Of the 47 em­ploy­ers newly placed on the watch list, 30 are in fi­nan­cial ser­vices and pro­fes­sional ser­vices, with the rest in ad­min­is­tra­tive and sup­port ser­vices, man­u­fac­tur­ing and ed­u­ca­tion. They vary in size, in­clude banks, fund man­agers and man­age­ment con­sult­ing firms, and the largest has al­most 2,000 PMETs.</p>
    <p>“While these firms were sup­port­ing lo­cal PMET em­ploy­ment, their work­force pro­files raise con­cerns when com­pared to in­dus­try peers,” said MOM, ex­plain­ing that they had an ex­cep­tion­ally high pro­por­tion of for­eign PMETs com­pared with their in­dus­try peers.</p>
    <p>In one wealth man­age­ment firm, al­most three quar­ters were of the same na­tion­al­ity. In a bank, al­most twothirds were of the same na­tion­al­ity.</p>
    <p>In ad­di­tion to the 47 em­ploy­ers,</p>
    <p>MOM has iden­ti­fied an­other 240 for fur­ther in­ves­ti­ga­tion of pos­si­ble pre-se­lec­tion of for­eign­ers, or not ad­her­ing to the spirit of FCF job ad­ver­tis­ing re­quire­ments.</p>
    <p>NTUC as­sis­tant sec­re­tary-gen­eral Patrick Tay wel­comed the “con­crete” ac­tion, say­ing “such mal­prac­tices still abound”. He called for “more ro­bust mea­sures such as pub­lish­ing the names of these er­rant com­pa­nies on the watch list”.</p>
    <p>Since 2016, 3,200 EP ap­pli­ca­tions have been re­jected or with­held by MOM, or with­drawn by the em­ploy­ers placed on the watch list. These em­ploy­ers have since hired more than 4,800 Sin­ga­porean PMETs.</p>
    <p>“We will sub­ject their hir­ing to closer scru­tiny to en­sure that there is no na­tion­al­ity bias against lo­cals, which is un­ac­cept­able and not in line with fair, merit-based hir­ing,” said the min­istry.</p>
    <p>Man­power Min­is­ter Josephine Teo gave no­tice in Jan­uary that em­ploy­ers would face stiffer penal­ties for dis­crim­i­na­tory hir­ing prac­tices, and could be pros­e­cuted in court if they make false dec­la­ra­tions on fair hir­ing con­sid­er­a­tion.</p>
    <p>Er­rant em­ploy­ers will not be able to re­new the work passes of ex­ist­ing em­ploy­ees dur­ing a de­bar­ment pe­riod. They also can­not ap­ply for new work passes for at least 12 months – up from the pre­vi­ous min­i­mum of six months. The de­bar­ment pe­riod can ex­tend to 24 months for egre­gious cases.</p>
    <p>MOM said that in these chal­leng­ing times, “we will be ex­tra vig­i­lant against un­fair hir­ing, to en­sure that lo­cal job seek­ers are treated fairly”.</p>
    <p>It urged peo­ple to re­port spe­cific in­stances of dis­crim­i­na­tory be­hav­iour, adding that whis­tle-blow­ers’ iden­tity will be kept con­fi­den­tial.</p>
    <p>HIR­ING PRAC­TICES RE­VIEWED</p>
    <p>They ad­justed their hir­ing process to ac­tively ex­pand their search net­works to reach out to more lo­cal can­di­dates and tapped Work­force Sin­ga­pore and NTUC-e2i’s ser­vices, as well as pro­grammes for train­ing and up­skilling such as free work­shops for emerg­ing ’’ tech­nolo­gies.</p>
    <p>THE MAN­POWER MIN­ISTRY, on em­ploy­ers that were placed on the Fair Con­sid­er­a­tion Frame­work watch list.</p>
    <p>The lat­est watch list of busi­nesses ex­hibit­ing dis­crim­i­na­tory hir­ing shows a wealth man­age­ment firm had a work­force in which al­most three quar­ters of its PMETs were from the same na­tion­al­ity.</p>
    <p>Oth­ers had for­eign­ers com­pris­ing more than half of their pool of pro­fes­sion­als, man­agers, ex­ec­u­tives and tech­ni­cians (PMETs), much more than their in­dus­try peers.</p>
    <p>In ad­di­tion, 30 of the 47 em­ploy­ers newly placed on the Fair Con­sid­er­a­tion Frame­work (FCF) watch list are from the fi­nan­cial ser­vice and pro­fes­sional ser­vice sec­tors.</p>
    <p>This brings the to­tal from these two sec­tors, put on the watch list since 2016, to 190.</p>
    <p>The Man­power Min­istry (MOM) said yes­ter­day that in engaging these em­ploy­ers, the Tri­par­tite Al­liance for Fair and Pro­gres­sive Em­ploy­ment Prac­tices (Tafep) found they were of­ten not fa­mil­iar with the skill set of lo­cal job seek­ers as well as the Gov­ern­ment’s sup­port mea­sures to reskill and up­skill lo­cal work­ers.</p>
    <p>For ex­am­ple, some firms claimed they were un­able to find lo­cal work­ers with the re­quired ex­per­tise or ex­pe­ri­ence, in­clud­ing for more tech­ni­cal roles such as se­nior soft­ware en­gi­neers and UX designers. The fact is they had not cast their net wide enough, such as by tap­ping Pro­fes­sional Con­ver­sion Pro­grammes (PCPs), the min­istry noted.</p>
    <p>Other em­ploy­ers as­sumed that lo­cal work­ers lacked the global ex­po­sure nec­es­sary to function ef­fec­tively across the mul­ti­ple coun­tries that they op­er­ate in, as some roles, such as port­fo­lio man­ager or prod­uct man­ager, re­quire mar­ket-spe­cific knowl­edge, it said.</p>
    <p>It added that through Tafep’s in­ter­ven­tion, most em­ploy­ers re­viewed their hir­ing prac­tices to give lo­cal job seek­ers a fair chance.</p>
    <p>“They ad­justed their hir­ing process to ac­tively ex­pand their search net­works to reach out to more lo­cal can­di­dates and tapped Work­force Sin­ga­pore and NTUC-e2i’s ser­vices, as well as pro­grammes for train­ing and up­skilling such as free work­shops for emerg­ing tech­nolo­gies.</p>
    <p>“As a re­sult, these em­ploy­ers found that they were able to hire lo­cal em­ploy­ees to meet their man­power needs, and now have in place a more sus­tain­able re­cruit­ment and de­vel­op­ment strat­egy to drive their growth in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>“The em­ploy­ers also par­tic­i­pated in in­tern­ship and man­age­ment trainee pro­grammes to build and de­velop the lo­cal tal­ent pool.”</p>
    <p>More than 100 em­ploy­ers from these two sec­tors have been taken off the watch list af­ter demon­strat­ing a strong com­mit­ment to im­prove their hir­ing prac­tices.</p>
    <p>The min­istry yes­ter­day urged all em­ploy­ers to adopt ex­em­plary em­ploy­ment prac­tices, by tap­ping the var­i­ous gov­ern­ment schemes to de­velop a strong Sin­ga­porean core.</p>
    <p>It said that to build the lo­cal tal­ent pool in the fi­nan­cial ser­vice and pro­fes­sional ser­vice sec­tors, the Gov­ern­ment has a range of pro­grammes, such as the Mon­e­tary Author­ity of Sin­ga­pore’s train­ing schemes; the In­sti­tute of Bank­ing and Fi­nance Sin­ga­pore’s Tech­nol­ogy in Fi­nance Im­mer­sion Pro­gramme; and Work­force Sin­ga­pore’s PCPs for the pro­fes­sional ser­vice sec­tor.</p>
    <p>It urged peo­ple to re­port spe­cific in­stances of dis­crim­i­na­tory be­hav­iour on Tafep’s web­site.</p>
    <p>Em­ploy­ers who breach fair hir­ing re­quire­ments will be barred from hir­ing for­eign work­ers or re­new­ing their passes for up to two years, and may face pros­e­cu­tion, if they made false dec­la­ra­tions on fair con­sid­er­a­tion.</p>
