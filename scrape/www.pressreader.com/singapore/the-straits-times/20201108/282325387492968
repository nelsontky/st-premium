    <p>When the Malaysian bor­der shut and pan­icked cus­tomers rushed to the stores, hy­dro­pon­ics farm ComCrop re­ceived fran­tic calls from the su­per­mar­kets.</p>
    <p>Chief ex­ec­u­tive of­fi­cer Peter Bar­ber re­calls: “So we pre-har­vested every­thing. The veg­eta­bles nor­mally take six weeks from seed to har­vest, but we were har­vest­ing what was one to two weeks old just so we could give them every­thing we had.</p>
    <p>“That meant we had noth­ing left and had to strug­gle through two months with­out in­come. We had rental re­bates from our JTC land­lord, but still had to pay salaries.</p>
    <p>“Covid-19 made peo­ple un­der­stand how im­por­tant lo­cal pro­duc­tion and food se­cu­rity are. You can store rice and freeze meat, but veg­eta­bles have to be fresh.”</p>
    <p>In 2012, ComCrop was the pi­o­neer in rooftop farm­ing when it started in *Scape in Or­chard Road, which is now closed for re­de­vel­op­ment. It opened an­other farm in Wood­lands three years ago with Sin­ga­pore’s only hy­dro­pon­ics green­house on the rooftop of a JTC build­ing.</p>
    <p>The ef­fi­cient farm­ing method uses sun­light in a con­trolled en­vi­ron­ment. No pes­ti­cide is used. The greens are seeded in small cubes made with biodegrad­able waste and grown in wa­ter that is con­tin­u­ously re­cy­cled, which Mr Bar­ber says is 90 per cent more ef­fi­cient than soil-based farm­ing where the wa­ter runs off into the ground.</p>
    <p>A com­puter mon­i­tors the wa­ter qual­ity and PH and nu­tri­ent lev­els, and adds liq­uid fer­tiliser from a tank.</p>
    <p>ComCrop sells its veg­eta­bles and herbs at FairPrice su­per­mar­kets and on Red­mart at no more than $3 a pack.</p>
    <p>Mr Bar­ber says: “We don’t have food se­cu­rity un­less we have af­ford­able food. Our goal is to have prices on a par with Malaysia’s. Sin­ga­pore­ans want to sup­port lo­cal pro­duce, but we can’t ex­pect them to pay dou­ble for it. But if we have a sim­i­lar price point and ours has no pes­ti­cide and is grown lo­cally, they’ll buy.”</p>
    <p>The com­pany will set up an­other green­house at the Wood­lands farm next year with more ad­vanced tech­nol­ogy for grow­ing Asian veg­eta­bles like caixin. That will add an­other 2,000 sq m to the cur­rent 800 sq m space and boost out­put from 20 to 200 tonnes a year, says Mr Bar­ber, who is also do­ing re­search on crops like rosemary and dif­fer­ent let­tuce va­ri­eties.</p>
    <p>But he feels the “30 by 30” plan is not am­bi­tious enough.</p>
    <p>“You are only ask­ing ev­ery­one to pro­duce three times more in 10 years. I took over the com­pany three years ago and we’re al­ready do­ing 20 times more vol­ume. A year from now, we will be do­ing an­other 10 times as much,” he says.</p>
    <p>“If all the pro­duc­ers in Sin­ga­pore can do this, we can ex­ceed the ‘30 by 30’ goal, but it has to be done af­ford­ably. I be­lieve we can get there and not just for veg­eta­bles. There are also ex­cit­ing things hap­pen­ing in fish and egg pro­duc­tion.”</p>
    <p>When coun­tries closed their bor­ders ear­lier this year as the Covid-19 pan­demic spread, food se­cu­rity be­came a very real is­sue for Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>For­tu­nately, the im­port chan­nels stayed open and there was no food short­age, but prices crept up.</p>
    <p>The Gov­ern­ment has set a “30 by 30” goal to pro­duce 30 per cent of the coun­try’s nu­tri­tional needs lo­cally by 2030 – the fig­ure now stands at less than 10 per cent. The aim is to boost the pro­duc­tion of veg­eta­bles and pro­tein sources.</p>
    <p>But the pan­demic has caused dis­rup­tions and cre­ated set­backs for many lo­cal food pro­duc­ers, with busi­ness plum­met­ing overnight after restau­rants and ho­tels closed dur­ing the two-month cir­cuit breaker. They also had to deal with bad debts when some restau­rants folded.</p>
    <p>Three ma­jor food pro­duc­ers here share their ex­pe­ri­ences and their plans to meet the “30 by 30” tar­get.</p>
