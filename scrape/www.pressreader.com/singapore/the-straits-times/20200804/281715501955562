    <p>The Aus­tralian state of Vic­to­ria is fur­ther tight­en­ing a strict lock­down in Mel­bourne, re­veal­ing plans to com­pletely shut all nonessen­tial shops and dras­ti­cally scale back ac­tiv­i­ties in ma­jor sec­tors such as con­struc­tion.</p>
    <p>In an an­nounce­ment that will ef­fec­tively shut­ter the econ­omy in Aus­tralia’s se­cond-largest city, Vic­to­ria’s Pre­mier Daniel An­drews said yes­ter­day that he was forced to im­pose “rad­i­cal” mea­sures for the next six weeks de­spite the se­vere im­pact on house­hold in­comes.</p>
    <p>He told re­porters: “Th­ese are heart­break­ing de­ci­sions, but there is sim­ply no choice. I know that there will be sub­stan­tial pain… There is no choice but to do that dam­age to fix the health prob­lem.”</p>
    <p>The plans were an­nounced just a day af­ter the state in­sti­tuted tough new re­stric­tions in Mel­bourne, in­clud­ing a six-week 8pm to 5am cur­few that be­gan on Sun­day.</p>
    <p>Mr An­drews said all shops will have to close from the end of to­mor­row, ex­cept for those pro­vid­ing cru­cial ser­vices such as su­per­mar­kets, phar­ma­cies, petrol sta­tions, banks and post of­fices. Liquor stores have also been deemed cru­cial.</p>
    <p>From the end of Fri­day, abat­toirs and meat­works, the source of Covid-19 clus­ters, will re­duce pro­duc­tion by a third and will be sub­ject to strict safety pro­to­cols.</p>
    <p>Work­ers must wear gloves, gowns and masks like health work­ers, and have their tem­per­a­tures checked and un­dergo reg­u­lar test­ing.</p>
    <p>In the con­struc­tion sec­tor, a ma­jor source of em­ploy­ment, large-scale build­ing projects – those in­volv­ing more than three storeys – will be al­lowed to em­ploy only 25 per cent of their reg­u­lar work­ers. At res­i­den­tial projects, a max­i­mum of five peo­ple will be al­lowed on site.</p>
    <p>Mr An­drews urged shop­pers not to hoard goods, say­ing that the gov­ern­ment is work­ing with stores to en­sure a steady sup­ply of reg­u­lar es­sen­tial items. “You may not be able to buy every sin­gle item that you want in the quan­ti­ties you nor­mally would, but peo­ple will have ev­ery­thing they need,” he said.</p>
    <p>The city of Mel­bourne, with a pop­u­la­tion of five mil­lion, woke yes­ter­day morn­ing to an eerie si­lence af­ter ex­pe­ri­enc­ing the new cur­few.</p>
    <p>Res­i­dents in the city are only al­lowed to leave the house alone, and for an hour a day. They can­not travel more than 5km from home and must go out­side only for shop­ping, ex­er­cise, work or care­giv­ing.</p>
    <p>Schools will shut from to­mor­row. Pub­lic trans­port ser­vices are also be­ing re­stricted.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, Vic­to­ria recorded a fur­ther 429 cases of Covid-19, down from 671 on Sun­day. Thir­teen more peo­ple have died, bring­ing the state’s toll to 136.</p>
    <p>Since the re­cent surge in Vic­to­ria, other states and ter­ri­to­ries have also been record­ing higher num­bers of cases but have so far avoided un­con­trol­lable out­breaks. Aus­tralia has so far recorded a to­tal of 18,318 cases and 221 deaths.</p>
    <p>Busi­nesses in Mel­bourne will be en­ti­tled to two grants, to­talling A$10,000 (S$9,780) each, for the cur­rent shut­down.</p>
    <p>Na­tion­wide, work­ers forced to self-iso­late for 14 days will re­ceive a “dis­as­ter pay­ment” of A$1,500 if they do not have leave en­ti­tle­ments. Other re­liefs in­clude wage sub­si­dies for work­ers at badly af­fected busi­nesses.</p>
    <p>Mel­bourne’s ris­ing case num­bers have prompted New Zealand to de­lay plans for a trans-Tas­man “travel bub­ble” be­tween the two coun­tries. New Zealand has had no com­mu­nity trans­mis­sions of the virus for more than 90 days.</p>
    <p>New Zealand’s Prime Min­is­ter Jacinda Ardern said yes­ter­day that Aus­tralia would need to be free of com­mu­nity trans­mis­sions for 28 days be­fore travel be­tween the neigh­bours would be per­mit­ted.</p>
    <p>She told The AM Show that the move “will be on the back­burner for sev­eral months”.</p>
    <p>Vic­to­ria’s Chief Health Of­fi­cer Brett Sut­ton said yes­ter­day that the strict new mea­sures should re­sult in lower in­fec­tion rates in the next 10 to 14 days.</p>
    <p>Mr An­drews said the mea­sures were the “only way to get th­ese num­bers un­der con­trol”. If the mea­sures did not work in six weeks, he said, they could be fur­ther tight­ened.</p>
    <p>“We can­not con­tinue to have 400 to 500 cases a day and so many peo­ple in hos­pi­tal, so many peo­ple dy­ing,” he said.</p>
    <p>“Th­ese are the tough calls that have to be made, oth­er­wise we are not fac­ing a six-week set of re­stric­tions, we are in for a six-month strat­egy that I don’t think will work.”</p>
