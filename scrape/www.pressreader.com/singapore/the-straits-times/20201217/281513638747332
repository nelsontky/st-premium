    <p>Pres­i­dent Joko Wi­dodo said he will be the first to be in­oc­u­lated with the Covid-19 vac­cine when it be­comes avail­able in In­done­sia. “This is to build trust and cer­tainty among the pub­lic that the vac­cines are safe,” he said. The vac­ci­na­tions will be free for all In­done­sians.</p>
    <p>Pres­i­dent Joko Wi­dodo an­nounced yes­ter­day that he will be the first re­cip­i­ent of a Covid-19 vac­cine in In­done­sia and vac­ci­na­tions will be avail­able free to all ci­ti­zens.</p>
    <p>“I want to em­pha­sise once again that I will be­come the first one to be vac­ci­nated. This is to build trust and cer­tainty among the pub­lic that the vac­cines are safe,” said Mr Joko, pop­u­larly known as Jokowi.</p>
    <p>In an ad­dress from the pres­i­den­tial palace that was live-streamed on YouTube, Mr Joko, 59, also said that af­ter re­ceiv­ing sug­ges­tions and re­cal­cu­lat­ing state fi­nances, he de­cided that the vac­cines will be free for In­done­sians.</p>
    <p>“I’ve or­dered the Fi­nance Min­is­ter to prioritise (the vac­ci­na­tion pro­gramme) and re­al­lo­cate (the state bud­get) to pro­vide free vac­cines so there’s no rea­son that the peo­ple can’t ac­cess them.”</p>
    <p>An on­line sur­vey by the Health Min­istry found that only about one-third of In­done­sians hop­ing to be vac­ci­nated are will­ing to pay for the shots. The poll, in­volv­ing more than 115,000 par­tic­i­pants across the ar­chi­pel­ago, was car­ried out along with the In­done­sian Tech­ni­cal Ad­vi­sory Group on Im­mu­ni­sa­tion from Sept 19 to 30, with sup­port from Unicef and the World Health Or­gan­i­sa­tion.</p>
    <p>Around 65 per cent of the sur­vey’s par­tic­i­pants were keen to get the shots once the vac­cines are made avail­able to the pub­lic, while 27 per cent were hes­i­tant and al­most 8 per cent re­jected it.</p>
    <p>Only 35 per cent of those want­ing to get the shots were will­ing to pay for them, while 38 per cent would not want to pay and the rest were un­de­cided.</p>
    <p>In­done­sia, which has the world’s fourth-largest pop­u­la­tion – at about 270 mil­lion – re­ceived the first batch of a Covid-19 vac­cine, to­talling 1.2 mil­lion doses, from China’s Si­no­vac Biotech on Dec 6.</p>
    <p>It hopes to be­gin in­oc­u­lat­ing its work­ing pop­u­la­tion aged 18 to 59, who are con­sid­ered most mo­bile be­cause of their oc­cu­pa­tions.</p>
    <p>It has tar­geted 246 mil­lion doses to cover 107 mil­lion peo­ple, or 67 per cent of the tar­get group, rep­re­sent­ing nearly 40 per cent of its to­tal pop­u­la­tion.</p>
    <p>Si­no­vac and No­vavax are set to help de­liver 155.5 mil­lion doses.</p>
    <p>In­done­sia is in talks with other vac­cine mak­ers, such as As­traZeneca, Pfizer and Covax, to source for the rest.</p>
    <p>A roll-out date will be set af­ter its drug mon­i­tor­ing agency BPOM gives emer­gency use au­tho­ri­sa­tion, which is likely early next year.</p>
    <p>Un­der its cur­rent plan, In­done­sians work­ing on the front line in the bat­tle against the pan­demic, such as health­care work­ers, po­lice and mil­i­tary per­son­nel, are set to get the shots first.</p>
    <p>This strat­egy is in con­trast with that of other coun­tries, which have be­gun pro­vid­ing the vac­cines to the el­derly and vul­ner­a­ble first. Bri­tain, for ex­am­ple, be­gan its vac­ci­na­tion pro­gramme with a 91-year-old woman last week.</p>
    <p>Health Min­is­ter Ter­awan Agus Pu­tranto had ear­lier said that the el­derly, peo­ple with ex­ist­ing health is­sues and preg­nant women are not be­ing put on In­done­sia’s pri­or­ity list be­cause the coun­try does not have the data to guar­an­tee the vac­cine’s safety for them.</p>
    <p>The Si­no­vac shots were tested on peo­ple aged be­tween 18 and 59.</p>
    <p>In­done­sia has recorded 636,154 Covid-19 cases and 19,248 deaths as at yes­ter­day, the worst on both counts in South-east Asia.</p>
