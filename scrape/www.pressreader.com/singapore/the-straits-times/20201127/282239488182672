    <p>In the past five years, 29 rad­i­calised in­di­vid­u­als, many of whom were in­flu­enced by on­line ex­trem­ist ma­te­ri­als, have been dealt with un­der the In­ter­nal Se­cu­rity Act, said Sec­ond Min­is­ter for Home Af­fairs and Man­power Min­is­ter Josephine Teo.</p>
    <p>Speak­ing at yes­ter­day’s pre­miere of Seek­ing The Imam, a film on rad­i­cal­i­sa­tion by lo­cal non-gov­ern­men­tal or­gan­i­sa­tion Hu­man­ity Mat­ters, Mrs Teo un­der­scored the im­por­tance of in­ter-racial and re­li­gious un­der­stand­ing in or­der to keep the threats posed by ter­ror­ism and rad­i­cal­i­sa­tion at bay.</p>
    <p>These threats were thrust into the spot­light ear­lier this week, when the Min­istry of Home Af­fairs an­nounced it was in­ves­ti­gat­ing 37 peo­ple, in­clud­ing 23 for­eign­ers, for sus­pected rad­i­cal in­cli­na­tions, or for mak­ing com­ments that could in­cite vi­o­lence or stoke com­mu­nal un­rest. Six­teen of the for­eign­ers have been de­ported.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore has been on height­ened alert in the wake of re­cent ter</p>
    <p>ror at­tacks in France. French mag­a­zine Char­lie Hebdo had re­pub­lished car­i­ca­tures of Prophet Muham­mad on Sept 1, re­sult­ing in</p>
    <p>sev­eral at­tacks, in­clud­ing the be­head­ing of teacher Sa­muel Paty.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, Mrs Teo also men­tioned the shoot­ings in Vi­enna ear</p>
    <p>lier this month that killed four peo­ple, and an ex­plo­sion in Jed­dah tar­get­ing French in­ter­ests on Nov 11.</p>
    <p>Al­though such at­tacks did not be­come key top­ics of dis­cus­sion here, Mrs Teo said the threats are closer to Sin­ga­pore than they ap­pear. She pointed out that in South-east Asia, ter­ror­ist-linked groups are still op­er­a­tional and re­main ac­tive as they con­tinue to spread their ide­olo­gies on­line.</p>
    <p>“We in Sin­ga­pore must never as­sume we can ever be im­mune to the threat of rad­i­cal­i­sa­tion and ter­ror­ism,” she said at the film’s pre­miere at Fu­rama River­Front ho­tel.</p>
    <p>The film, which will be screened at se­lected in­sti­tu­tions and for com­mu­nity groups next year, was pro­duced by Dr Noor Huda Is­mail, a ter­ror­ism ex­pert and vis­it­ing fel­low at S. Ra­jarat­nam School of In­ter­na­tional Stud­ies, as well as hu­man­i­tar­ian Has­san Ah­mad.</p>
    <p>Mrs Teo said when it comes to rad­i­cal­i­sa­tion, an in­di­vid­ual might turn ex­trem­ist due to weak fam­ily and com­mu­nity net­works, but added that the In­ter­net and so­cial me­dia can be sig­nif­i­cantly in­flu­en­tial.</p>
    <p>An in­di­vid­ual’s psy­cho­log­i­cal and emo­tional state, which may be in­flu­enced by past trau­matic ex­pe­ri­ences, also plays a part. Mrs Teo said some of the rad­i­calised youth here were more sus­cep­ti­ble to ex­trem­ist causes due to per­sonal is­sues such as do­mes­tic vi­o­lence.</p>
    <p>The min­is­ter said so­ci­ety must come to­gether to counter threats posed by rad­i­cal­i­sa­tion, and she sketched out three ways to do so.</p>
    <p>First, she said Sin­ga­pore needs to make ev­ery effort to deepen cross­re­li­gious and cross-cul­tural un­der­stand­ing and in­ter­ac­tions. Mrs Teo pledged that the Govern­ment will con­tinue to be fair to all races and re­li­gions, and that it will con­tinue to take action against hate speech.</p>
    <p>But she added that it can­not do this alone. “Our ef­forts as in­di­vid­u­als and com­mu­ni­ties, to mix with one an­other, un­der­stand, ap­pre­ci­ate and de­fend our mul­ti­cul­tural way of life, are es­sen­tial to in­te­gra­tion,” she said.</p>
    <p>Sec­ond, a holis­tic ap­proach needs to be taken to counter rad­i­cal­i­sa­tion and rein­te­grate those who may have fallen astray. Mrs Teo said this in­cludes com­mu­nityled ef­forts by the Re­li­gious Re­ha­bil­i­ta­tion Group and the In­terA­gency After­care Group.</p>
    <p>And third, Sin­ga­pore needs to be vig­i­lant against signs of rad­i­cal­i­sa­tion. Mrs Teo en­cour­aged peo­ple here to re­port to the au­thor­i­ties any­one dis­play­ing signs of rad­i­cal­i­sa­tion. She ac­knowl­edged that this might be tough to do, but re­port­ing them early can pre­vent them from caus­ing harm.</p>
    <p>Mrs Teo also stressed that rad­i­cal­i­sa­tion is not lim­ited to any re­li­gion or eth­nic group, and brought up the Christchur­ch mosque shoot­ings last year, which killed 51 peo­ple.</p>
    <p>“Rad­i­cal­i­sa­tion is a poi­son that can seep wher­ever there are cracks in so­ci­ety,” she said.</p>
    <p>Al­though such at­tacks did not be­come key top­ics of dis­cus­sion here, Mrs Teo said the threats are closer to Sin­ga­pore than they ap­pear. She pointed out that in South-east Asia, ter­ror­ist-linked groups are still op­er­a­tional and re­main ac­tive as they con­tinue to spread their ide­olo­gies on­line.</p>
