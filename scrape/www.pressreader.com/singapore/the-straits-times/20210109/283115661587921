    <p>Aries (March 21 - April 19)</p>
    <p>You may say the wrong thing to the wrong per­son – but that does not mean you are doomed. In­sen­si­tiv­ity could be just what is needed to break the ice.</p>
    <p>Taurus (April 20 - May 20)</p>
    <p>You need to avoid the temp­ta­tion to talk over the crowd. It is hard to get peo­ple to take you se­ri­ously if you start preach­ing, though.</p>
    <p>Gemini (May 21 - June 20)</p>
    <p>You and your clos­est friend or ro­man­tic part­ner need to talk – and you should be on the same page. It is a good time to re­con­nect.</p>
    <p>Cancer (June 21 - July 22)</p>
    <p>You are feel­ing pulled in too many dif­fer­ent di­rec­tions – so try hard to find your cen­tre and stay there. Things are sure to get bet­ter.</p>
    <p>Leo (July 23 - Aug 22)</p>
    <p>Your ter­rific en­ergy is mak­ing it all the more likely that you end up go­ing on an ad­ven­ture. Check in with good friends to see who has the best plans.</p>
    <p>Virgo (Aug 23 - Sept 22)</p>
    <p>You have to let your­self re­spond to the day’s pres­sures with­out re­sist­ing too much – un­less you can see that you are headed for dis­as­ter.</p>
    <p>Libra (Sept 23 - Oct 22)</p>
    <p>Your projects need some at­ten­tion, so make sure you are giv­ing them your all. Things are look­ing up for you and your peo­ple.</p>
    <p>Scorpio (Oct 23 - Nov 21)</p>
    <p>Things are larger than they seem and you need to take them more se­ri­ously. Do not un­der­es­ti­mate the im­por­tance of any one fac­tor.</p>
    <p>Sagittariu­s (Nov 22 - Dec 21)</p>
    <p>Your in­ner sense of sat­is­fac­tion is show­ing – peo­ple can sense your pos­i­tive spirit and they most likely want to get closer.</p>
    <p>Capricorn (Dec 22 - Jan 19)</p>
    <p>Your progress is de­pen­dent on how will­ing you are to for­get the rest of the world. Only if your sub­con­scious mind runs the show can you tap this en­ergy.</p>
    <p>Aquarius (Jan 20 - Feb 18)</p>
    <p>It is a so­cial day for you – though your in­ter­ac­tions may be largely on­line or oth­er­wise non-tra­di­tional. Com­mune with peo­ple who share your be­liefs.</p>
    <p>Pisces (Feb 19 - March 20)</p>
    <p>You can count on a stroke of luck – not enough to change your life, but enough to bring a smile. Push it if you want to show off to that one spe­cial per­son.</p>
