    <p>LOS AN­GE­LES As Bradley Beal sank his free throw in the fi­nal sec­onds on Wed­nes­day, he knew he had reached a mile­stone – a record-ty­ing 60 points in a sin­gle Na­tional Bas­ket­ball As­so­ci­a­tion game for the Wash­ing­ton Wizards. But it was not enough.</p>
    <p>Joel Em­biid’s 38 points and 28 from Seth Curry saw the Philadel­phia 76ers with­stand Beal’s out­stand­ing per­for­mance in a 141-136 win over the Wizards at the Wells Fargo Cen­tre in Philadel­phia.</p>
    <p>To­bias Harris and Shake Mil­ton scored 19 points each. Ben Sim­mons had 17 points and 12 as­sists as the 76ers got their fifth straight win and pushed their league-lead­ing record to 7-1. “They pay me to take over the game, they pay me to dom­i­nate,” Em­biid said on ESPN.</p>
    <p>The Six­ers led by as many as 21 points in the third quar­ter, but the Wizards hung around and tied the score at 131-131 with four min­utes left to play.</p>
    <p>From there Philadel­phia scored eight straight points to pull away, the de­feat more painful for the Wizards as Russell West­brook de­parted in the wan­ing min­utes with a hand in­jury af­ter 20 points, eight re­bounds and 12 as­sists.</p>
    <p>Beal, who once scored 53 and 55 points in con­sec­u­tive games, sank a free throw with 4.4 sec­onds left to reach the 60-point mark set by for­mer Wiz­ard Gil­bert Are­nas in 2006.</p>
    <p>De­spite the Six­ers’ win, Em­biid was not pleased that they al­lowed a free-scor­ing Beal to have his night. “He got too many good looks. We weren’t able to stop him. There’s no rea­son any­body should drop 60 on us,” he said.</p>
    <p>Wizards coach Scott Brooks sug­gested af­ter the game the record mat­tered lit­tle to Beal, adding: “He can score a lot of points on any team on any given night, but he wants to lead us in vic­to­ries.”</p>
    <p>Else­where, Mal­colm Brog­don scored a ca­reer-high 35 points and Myles Turner recorded eight blocked shots as the In­di­ana Pac­ers clinched a 114-107 home vic­tory over the Hous­ton Rock­ets.</p>
    <p>Brog­don added seven as­sists and three steals in 39 min­utes. He had just one turnover. Do­man­tas Sabo­nis added his eighth dou­ble-dou­ble with 22 points and 12 re­bounds.</p>
    <p>The Rock­ets, play­ing without cen­tre Chris­tian Wood (sore left knee), were led by John Wall (28 points) and Eric Gordon, who scored 20 points off the bench.</p>
    <p>The Pac­ers won their sec­ond straight and beat Hous­ton at home for the first time since Jan­uary 2017.</p>
    <p>“My team trusts me with the ball, my coaches trust me with the ball,” Brog­don said. “Th­ese shots were al­ready made this sum­mer, they were al­ready made in pre­sea­son.”</p>
    <p>In Mil­wau­kee, Gian­nis An­te­tok­oun­mpo had 25 points and eight re­bounds to lead the home team to a 130-115 win over Detroit.</p>
    <p>The Bucks won t heir third straight and swept the two-game set with the Pis­tons af­ter win­ning the first on Mon­day.</p>
    <p>In Phoenix, Western Con­fer­ence lead­ers the Suns de­feated the Toronto Rap­tors 123-115.</p>
    <p>Devin Booker scored 15 of his 24 points in the third quar­ter and Jae Crow­der added 21 points for the Suns, who have a 6-2 record.</p>
