    <p>Bud­get car­rier Scoot has apol­o­gised for er­ro­neously send­ing an email meant for pas­sen­gers on a spe­cific up­com­ing flight to a large num­ber of past trav­ellers or those with fu­ture book­ings.</p>
    <p>The low-cost arm of Sin­ga­pore Air­lines said in a state­ment last night: “This er­ro­neous e-mail arose due to hu­man er­ror, and was not a data se­cu­rity or hack­ing in­ci­dent.</p>
    <p>“Scoot takes this in­ci­dent very se­ri­ously and will con­duct an in­ter­nal review look­ing into how to fur­ther strengthen our in­ter­nal pro­cesses. We have also in­formed Sin­ga­pore’s Per­sonal Data Pro­tec­tion Commission of the in­ci­dent and con­tacted all af­fected cus­tomers with an ex­pla­na­tion of what hap­pened.”</p>
    <p>The e-mail ti­tled “Ur­gent: Neg­a­tive Covid-19 cer­tifi­cate re­quired for your flight to Guangzhou” went out shortly af­ter 2pm yes­ter­day, caus­ing alarm and con­cern among re­cip­i­ents, many of whom took to so­cial me­dia won­der­ing if there had been a data breach or if their per­sonal in­for­ma­tion had been leaked.</p>
    <p>Scoot said the e-mail was meant only for cus­tomers booked on Scoot Flight TR100 from Sin­ga­pore to Guangzhou de­part­ing at 5.15am on Sun­day, to in­form them of new travel re­quire­ments for their flight. How­ever, it was “er­ro­neously sent to a dis­tri­bu­tion list con­tain­ing cus­tomers who have trav­elled with Scoot in the past, or who have fu­ture book­ings with Scoot”.</p>
    <p>The air­line did not say how many pas­sen­gers the e-mail went out to, but some past pas­sen­gers re­ported re­ceiv­ing mul­ti­ple e-mails with book­ing ref­er­ence num­bers of pre­vi­ous Scoot flights they had trav­elled on over the past year, or ear­lier.</p>
    <p>The air­line said: “Scoot un­der­stands the worry and con­cerns cus­tomers would have over the use of their per­sonal in­for­ma­tion. We have es­tab­lished that no new book­ing was cre­ated. There was also no leak of sen­si­tive per­sonal in­for­ma­tion; the per­sonal in­for­ma­tion that was in­cluded in the er­ro­neous e-mail was limited to first name and book­ing con­fir­ma­tion ID, and the er­ro­neous e-mail was sent to the e-mail ad­dress as­so­ci­ated with the orig­i­nal book­ing.”</p>
    <p>Scoot also said it would like to as­sure cus­tomers that no third party was sent an e-mail with their per­sonal in­for­ma­tion. “How­ever, if they pre­vi­ously made a book­ing on an­other party’s be­half, they may see the other party’s first name in the e-mail in­stead. No cur­rent book­ings can be ac­cessed with this in­for­ma­tion.”</p>
    <p>It added: “Scoot sin­cerely apol­o­gises to all af­fected cus­tomers.”</p>
