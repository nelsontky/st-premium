    <p>Two new parks will be part of a na­ture cor­ri­dor that con­nects the Cen­tral Na­ture Park Net­work and the fu­ture Ten­gah For­est Cor­ri­dor.</p>
    <p>The first, Bukit Ba­tok Hill­side Na­ture Park, will be lo­cated be­tween Bukit Ba­tok West Av­enue 2 and Bukit Ba­tok West Av­enue 5. The 8.9ha fa­cil­ity, about the size of 12 foot­ball fields, is slated to open in 2024.</p>
    <p>The sec­ond, the 16ha Bukit Ba­tok Cen­tral Na­ture Park, will be in the forested area next to the Civil Ser­vice Club @ Bukit Ba­tok, but its launch date has not been set.</p>
    <p>The two parks will be part of the newly an­nounced Bukit Ba­tok Na­ture Cor­ri­dor, which will con­sist of over 125ha of na­ture parks and 10km of trails, said Min­is­ter for Na­tional De­vel­op­ment Des­mond Lee yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The Na­tional Parks Board (NParks) said it has been work­ing with other agen­cies on link­ing Ten­gah and the Cen­tral Catch­ment area since 2014, with other fea­tures in the cor­ri­dor, like the Bukit Gom­bak Park, set to open next year.</p>
    <p>Mr Lee said the parks act as step­ping stones within the ex­ist­ing net­work of green spa­ces be­tween Bukit Timah and Ten­gah, and pro­vide food and shel­ter for na­tive flora and fauna to thrive.</p>
    <p>He also ac­knowl­edged that there have been con­cerns about the im­pact of up­com­ing de­vel­op­ments in Bukit Ba­tok and Ten­gah</p>
    <p>on bio­di­ver­sity in th­ese ar­eas, and said the Gov­ern­ment aims to strike a bal­ance be­tween de­vel­op­ment and na­ture con­ser­va­tion in its plan­ning ap­proach.</p>
    <p>One re­sult of such an ap­proach is the up­com­ing Bukit Ba­tok Hill­side Na­ture Park. The Min­istry of Na­tional De­vel­op­ment said in Oc­to­ber that it con­ducted an en­vi­ron­men­tal im­pact as­sess­ment to guide the de­vel­op­ment of the site, and en­gaged mem­bers of the na­ture com­mu­nity in Au­gust last year on the de­vel­op­ment of the Bukit Ba­tok Hill­side Na­ture Park area, adding that their feed­back and sug­ges­tions shaped the find­ings and rec­om­men­da­tions of the study.</p>
    <p>It also said then that both the stream and a catch­ment area will be re­tained in the fu­ture park, as per the study’s rec­om­men­da­tions, which na­ture groups sup­ported. The two fea­tures lie in an area that was re­zoned from res­i­den­tial use to park use in the Ur­ban Re­de­vel­op­ment Au­thor­ity’s Master­plan.</p>
    <p>Mr Lee yes­ter­day also an­nounced en­hance­ments to the Dairy Farm Na­ture Park, which is lo­cated in For­eign Min­is­ter Vi­vian Balakr­ish­nan’s Cashew ward in Hol­land-Bukit Timah GRC and part of the Cen­tral Na­ture Park Net­work. A new ex­hi­bi­tion at the Wallace Ed­u­ca­tion Cen­tre, lo­cated in Dairy Farm Na­ture Park, was opened by Mr Lee yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>It is the largest per­ma­nent ex­hi­bi­tion in Sin­ga­pore on Bri­tish nat­u­ral­ist Al­fred Rus­sel Wallace that in­tro­duces vis­i­tors to Wallace and his the­o­ries of evo­lu­tion and nat­u­ral selec­tion, NParks said. The cen­tre is open ev­ery Tues­day to Sun­day from 8.30am to 5pm.</p>
    <p>Also part of the en­hance­ments is an ex­ten­sion to the Wallace Trail within the park from the orig­i­nal 1km to 2.2km. The ex­tended trail stretches to Hil­lview MRT sta­tion, and in­cludes a new deck that gives vis­i­tors an un­ob­structed view of the sec­ondary for­est in Dairy Farm Na­ture Park. It is open from 7am to 7pm daily.</p>
    <p>To­gether with six other na­ture parks and the Bukit Timah and Cen­tral Catch­ment na­ture re­serves, the Dairy Farm Na­ture Park is part of the Cen­tral Na­ture Park Net­work. Mr Lee said they “act as buf­fers to pro­tect our cen­tral na­ture re­serves, which are some of the rich­est sources of our nat­u­ral cap­i­tal, against the im­pact of ur­ban­i­sa­tion”.</p>
    <p>An eighth park – Ri­fle Range Na­ture Park – will join the net­work when it opens in 2022.</p>
    <p>Be­sides en­joy­ing the parks, the pub­lic is en­cour­aged to con­trib­ute to green spa­ces and cor­ri­dors.</p>
    <p>Op­por­tu­ni­ties in­clude tree plant­ing and habi­tat en­hance­ment ac­tiv­i­ties un­der NParks’ One Mil­lion Trees move­ment, which was launched in April and aims to plant more than a mil­lion trees in Sin­ga­pore over a decade.</p>
    <p>To sup­port the prop­a­ga­tion and nur­tur­ing of saplings planted un­der the move­ment, at least 10 com­mu­nity nurs­eries will be set up across the is­land over the next three years, in­clud­ing one at the Sin­ga­pore Botanic Gar­dens and an­other at Pasir Pan­jang Nurs­ery.</p>
    <p>The first such nurs­ery was launched yes­ter­day at Dairy Farm Na­ture Park, where vol­un­teers can grow na­ture plants that were col­lected as seeds or wildlings on trails in the area. When they reach a suit­able ma­tu­rity, the saplings will then be re­planted in the for­est.</p>
    <p>The nurs­ery was set up with the sup­port of a $160,000 do­na­tion from HSBC to NParks’ reg­is­tered char­ity, the Gar­den City Fund.</p>
