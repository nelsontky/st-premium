    <p>OR­LANDO • The Na­tional Bas­ket­ball As­so­ci­a­tion (NBA) sea­son will re­turn but not right away.</p>
    <p>In a meet­ing within the NBA’s bub­ble at Dis­ney World in Florida, play­ers yes­ter­day voted to con­tinue the re­main­der of the play-offs af­ter a night in which they sat out in protest over the po­lice shoot­ing of a black man, ac­cord­ing to ESPN.</p>
    <p>Today’s three games will still be post­poned. The de­ci­sion came af­ter the Mil­wau­kee Bucks led an un­prece­dented boy­cott dur­ing the firstround play-offs on Wed­nes­day.</p>
    <p>It forced the NBA to halt its post­sea­son sched­ule and prompted a wave of walk­outs by teams and play­ers across other sports. Ath­letes from the Women’s Na­tional Bas­ket­ball As­so­ci­a­tion, Ma­jor League Base­ball and Ma­jor League Soc­cer also took their bold­est stand yet against sys­temic racism fol­low­ing the po­lice shoot­ing of Ja­cob Blake i n Kenosha, Wis­con­sin, on Sun­day.</p>
    <p>The moves dra­mat­i­cally es­ca­lated a coro­n­avirus-af­fected sea­son of ath­letes demon­strat­ing for so­cial jus­tice as some ex­pressed doubts about con­tin­u­ing to play amid wide­spread un­rest. But six-time For­mula One cham­pion Lewis Hamil­ton said yes­ter­day that he would not boy­cott Sun­day’s Bel­gian Grand Prix.</p>
    <p>The Bucks – over­all top seeds seek­ing their first NBA ti­tle since 1971 – re­fused to come out of their locker room for Game 5 of their se­ries against the Or­lando Magic on Wed­nes­day, when a win would have seen them through to the Eastern Con­fer­ence semi-fi­nals.</p>
    <p>“Over the last few days in our home state of Wis­con­sin, we’ve seen the hor­ren­dous video of Ja­cob Blake be­ing shot in the back seven times by a po­lice of­fi­cer i n Kenosha, and the ad­di­tional shoot­ing of pro­test­ers,” the Bucks play­ers said in a state­ment ex­plain­ing their boy­cott. “De­spite the over­whelm­ing plea for change, there has been no ac­tion, so our fo­cus today can­not be on bas­ket­ball.”</p>
    <p>Two more play-off games sched­uled for Wed­nes­day – the Hous­ton Rock­ets’ clash with the Ok­la­homa City Thun­der and the Los An­ge­les Lak­ers’ match-up with the Port­land Trail Blaz­ers – were quickly post­poned.</p>
    <p>LeBron James’ Lak­ers and Kawhi Leonard’s Los An­ge­les Clip­pers called for the sea­son to be aban­doned. But the top two sides in the Western Con­fer­ence were in the mi­nor­ity on Wed­nes­day at an emer­gency meet­ing of all 13 teams left in the play-offs.</p>
    <p>NBA TV also re­ported that some play­ers are con­tem­plat­ing leav­ing the bub­ble.</p>
    <p>It re­mained un­clear how the sea­son will pro­ceed but a source told ESPN’s Adrian Wo­j­narowski yes­ter­day that the play­ers have de­cided to re­sume the play-offs.</p>
    <p>James had ear­lier tweeted an­grily on Wed­nes­day about the shoot­ing of Blake.</p>
    <p>“WE DEMAND CHANGE. SICK OF IT,” wrote the four-time NBA Most Valu­able Player, who had re­vealed the emo­tional toll he was un­der on Mon­day.</p>
    <p>“I can’t even en­joy a play-off win right now, which is the sad part,” he said af­ter the Lak­ers took a 3-1 se­ries lead over the Trail Blaz­ers.</p>
    <p>“We are scared as black peo­ple in Amer­ica. Black men, black women, black kids. We are, we are ter­ri­fied.”</p>
    <p>For­mer US Pres­i­dent Barack Obama praised the Bucks in a Twit­ter post, adding: “It’s go­ing to take all our in­sti­tu­tions to stand up for our val­ues.”</p>
    <p>He in­cluded a three-minute video clip of an emo­tional Clip­pers coach Doc Rivers, who said: “We keep lov­ing this coun­try and this coun­try doesn’t love us back.”</p>
    <p>Since the NBA restarted, courts have the words “Black Lives Mat­ter” painted on them and many play­ers are wear­ing jer­seys with so­cial jus­tice slo­gans.</p>
    <p>De­spite the over­whelm­ing plea for change, there has been no ac­tion, so our fo­cus today can­not be on bas­ket­ball. ’’ MIL­WAU­KEE BUCKS PLAY­ERS, ex­plain­ing their boy­cott. UN­SAFE TER­RI­TORY I can’t even en­joy a play-off win right now, which is the sad part. We are scared as black peo­ple in Amer­ica. Black men, black women, black kids. We are, we are ter­ri­fied. ’’ LEBRON JAMES, Los An­ge­les Lak­ers for­ward, on how the shoot­ing af­fected him.</p>
