    <p>As the coro­n­avirus pan­demic drags on and the im­pact on busi­nesses and jobs mounts, wage sub­si­dies for em­ploy­ers to re­tain their lo­cal work­ers are be­ing ex­tended and will be­come more tar­geted. Un­der the $8 bil­lion more in Govern­ment sup­port that Deputy Prime Min­is­ter and Fi­nance Min­is­ter Heng Swee Keat an­nounced on Mon­day, the Jobs Sup­port Scheme (JSS) will con­tinue un­til March next year. But its lat­est ver­sion is scaled across dif­fer­ent tiers. Given that the im­pact of Covid-19 has been highly vari­able across sec­tors, main­tain­ing gen­er­ous sup­port in­def­i­nitely across all sec­tors would be a waste­ful use of public funds. It would also have the ef­fect of ar­ti­fi­cially prop­ping up un­vi­able firms.</p>
    <p>Only firms in the hard­est-hit aero­space, avi­a­tion and tourism sec­tors, which are cur­rently re­ceiv­ing 75 per cent wage sup­port, will get 50 per cent wage sup­port for seven more months. The built-en­vi­ron­ment sec­tor will get 50 per cent sup­port for two more months, be­fore this ta­pers down to 30 per cent of wages, paid up to March next year. Other sec­tors will get 10 per cent sup­port for seven more months. More buoy­ant sec­tors, such as bio­med­i­cal sciences, fi­nan­cial ser­vices, and in­fo­com­mu­ni­ca­tions tech­nol­ogy, will get this amount of sup­port up to De­cem­ber. But even at 10 per cent sup­port, the pay­outs cover more than half of em­ploy­ers’ CPF con­tri­bu­tions, which will help shore up work­ers’ CPF sav­ings. It would help if firms that are cop­ing well, such as in su­per­mar­kets and e-com­merce, vol­un­tar­ily re­turn or do­nate their JSS, which can then be re­cy­cled to those in greater need.</p>
    <p>Nev­er­the­less, while the more tar­geted JSS will go some way to­wards pre­serv­ing jobs, more re­trench­ments and busi­ness clo­sures are in­evitable. As the Govern­ment pre­vi­ously ac­knowl­edged, it can­not save ev­ery com­pany or ev­ery job. The smaller $8 bil­lion pack­age com­pared to the four Bud­gets this year, as well as the ta­per­ing-off of sup­port mea­sures, is a sig­nal to com­pa­nies that they have to think about trans­form­ing for the longer term. “Zom­bie” firms with un­sus­tain­able op­er­at­ing mod­els could even­tu­ally be win­nowed out. The lat­est mea­sures also send a sig­nal to firms that they have to right-size their man­power needs. Even those with higher lev­els of sup­port to help pro­tect their core ca­pa­bil­i­ties, such as in the avi­a­tion sec­tor, can­not avoid mak­ing painful ad­just­ments as air travel is not ex­pected to re­turn to pre-Covid-19 lev­els any time be­fore 2024. More staff may have to be trimmed or re­de­ployed to ex­ter­nal or­gan­i­sa­tions. Be­yond sav­ing jobs, the next phase of eco­nomic trans­for­ma­tion is about reskilling work­ers to stay nim­ble in a chang­ing labour mar­ket, ac­cel­er­at­ing firms’ au­to­ma­tion and dig­i­tal­i­sa­tion on ini­tia­tives, and en­cour­ag­ing them to move into new growth ar­eas. Firms, and work­ers, will have to pivot or per­ish.</p>
