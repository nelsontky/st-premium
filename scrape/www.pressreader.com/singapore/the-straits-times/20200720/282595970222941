    <p>The Covid-19 pan­demic has not curbed the de­sire to travel. Rather, travel is tak­ing on new forms as the world be­gins to adapt.</p>
    <p>In the lat­est in­stal­ment of the askST@NLB series, The Straits Times Travel Ed­i­tor Lee Siew Hua and Paul White­way, Asia-Pa­cific se­nior di­rec­tor at global on­line travel com­pany Skyscan­ner, dis­cussed the fu­ture of travel and the “del­i­cate dance of re­cov­ery” for the in­dus­try.</p>
    <p>They noted that, en­cour­ag­ingly, there has been an uptick in des­ti­na­tion searches, as well as in­creas­ing oc­cu­pancy rates as ho­tels be­gin to re­open.</p>
    <p>Of late, “travel bub­bles” have also emerged – these are gov­ern­ment­pro­posed arrangemen­ts to ease dis­rup­tion to trav­ellers and com­muters. One such travel bub­ble has been the Trans-Tas­man bub­ble be­tween Aus­tralia and New Zealand.</p>
    <p>Be­yond these en­cour­ag­ing signs of re­cov­ery for the travel in­dus­try, Ms Lee and Mr White­way touched on the chang­ing habits of trav­ellers as the world be­gins to emerge from lock­down.</p>
    <p>For one thing, ho­tels and air­lines com­mit­ted to high hy­giene stan­dards and prac­tices are pre­ferred. Trav­ellers are also choos­ing ho­tels with flex­i­ble can­cel­la­tion and room-chang­ing poli­cies. These con­sid­er­a­tions come ahead of his­tor­i­cal con­sid­er­a­tions such as price and lo­ca­tion.</p>
    <p>Ms Lee and Mr White­way also talked about the pre­cau­tions and in­no­va­tions that have arisen to cater to post-pan­demic trav­el­ling. For ex­am­ple, the air­port ex­pe­ri­ence, in­clud­ing Changi Air­port’s Ter­mi­nal 3, will be al­most en­tirely con­tact­less, from check-in to board­ing.</p>
    <p>In ad­di­tion, Ms Lee shared her ex­pe­ri­ence with the grow­ing sec­tor of vir­tual tours, in­clud­ing hunt­ing for flow­ers in the gar­dens of the Ky­oto Im­pe­rial Palace and learn­ing to make Rus­sian-style pan­cakes.</p>
    <p>The two also an­swered ques­tions from read­ers, in­clud­ing the pos­si­bil­ity of their travel plans, and the prices of air­fare and ho­tel rooms.</p>
    <p>The askST@NLB series is a col­lab­o­ra­tion be­tween ST and the Na­tional Li­brary Board. Typ­i­cally hosted monthly by cor­re­spon­dents at the Cen­tral Pub­lic Li­brary, the series, sus­pended in Fe­bru­ary due to the on­set of the coro­n­avirus, went dig­i­tal from May 22 in the form of free fort­nightly podcasts.</p>
    <p>Pre­vi­ous podcasts delved into life in China post-virus, the job mar­ket for young grad­u­ates post-Covid-19 and work­ing life in pan­demic and post-pan­demic Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>A pod­cast ear­lier this month ex­am­ined the new nor­mal for eater­ies as Sin­ga­pore emerged from phase two.</p>
    <p>• Lis­ten to this pod­cast at str.sg/JsyV.</p>
    <p>• The podcasts are avail­able on plat­forms in­clud­ing Spo­tify, Ap­ple Podcasts and Google Podcasts as well as on the ST Face­book page, and on SPH Ra­dio’s Money FM89.3.</p>
    <p>• NLB has pro­vided ad­di­tional con­tent on­line via ProQuest Cen­tral (ere­sources.nlb.gov.sg/ Main/browse/re­source/1111) for those keen to ex­plore the topic fur­ther. They in­clude “WTTC Lays Out Guide­lines For A Safe And Seam­less Travel In The ‘New Nor­mal’” in the June 29 edi­tion of Busi­ness World, as well as “En­vi­sion­ing The Fu­ture: Travel And Hos­pi­tal­ity In The Wake Of Coro­n­avirus” in the</p>
    <p>April 17 edi­tion.</p>

        <p data-role="text">Amid the Covid-19 pan&#xAD;demic, tourism is slowly pick&#xAD;ing up again. There are now four boat de&#xAD;par&#xAD;tures daily to the fa&#xAD;mous Nav&#xAD;a&#xAD;gio (Ship&#xAD;wreck) beach on the Io&#xAD;nian is&#xAD;land of Zakyn&#xAD;thos, Greece, com&#xAD;pared with the usual 20 for the sea&#xAD;son.</p>
