    <p>Home, Truly: Grow­ing Up With Sin­ga­pore, 1950s To The Present is pre­sented through five key themes cen­tred on the metaphor of a dwelling place, and de­signed to be in­ter­ac­tive through au­dio, video as well as safe touch screens.</p>
    <p>1 LAY­ING THE FOUN­DA­TION</p>
    <p>This sec­tion ex­plores how na­tion-build­ing looked and felt like to peo­ple on the ground, through the lay­ing down of key poli­cies in hous­ing, econ­omy, de­fence, health­care and in­fra­struc­ture.</p>
    <p>It fea­tures per­sonal ac­counts from peo­ple who have lived through the coun­try’s early years as an in­de­pen­dent na­tion, through the events they wit­nessed or the rites of pas­sage they went through.</p>
    <p>Some of these first-hand ac­counts were of mov­ing into a Hous­ing Board flat for the first time. Women who en­tered the work­force dur­ing the height of Sin­ga­pore’s rapid in­dus­tri­al­i­sa­tion are also fea­tured in this sec­tion.</p>
    <p>The sto­ries were doc­u­mented by sec­ondary school stu­dents and un­der­grad­u­ates as part of the mu­seum’s Stu­dent Archivist Project 2020. This sec­tion also fea­tures a spe­cially com­mis­sioned sound­scape, A Day In The Life Of Sin­ga­pore, which show­cases dis­tinc­tive sounds of peo­ple, places and ex­pe­ri­ences.</p>
    <p>2 MOV­ING IN</p>
    <p>This fea­tures some of the com­mon ex­pe­ri­ences and mem­o­ries that make a house a home, such as go­ing to school, en­joy­ing Sin­ga­pore hawker food and re­lax­ing in re­cre­ational spa­ces.</p>
    <p>Vis­i­tors are in­vited to step into im­mer­sive spa­ces that take them back to the com­fort­ing moments of cel­e­brat­ing fes­tiv­i­ties in their liv­ing room, or loung­ing by a juke­box play­ing Sin­ga­porean songs, both old and new, that have been part of the sound­track of our years of liv­ing and grow­ing up in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>There is also a Let’s Talk At The Tuck­shop sit­ting area, one of three chat cor­ners in the ex­hi­bi­tion, de­signed to al­low vis­i­tors to pause, re­flect and rem­i­nisce.</p>
    <p>3 LIV­ING TO­GETHER</p>
    <p>This ex­am­ines how Sin­ga­pore­ans have nav­i­gated the ten­sions and challenges they faced when liv­ing in shared spa­ces, as peo­ple set­tled into new homes.</p>
    <p>From numer­ous na­tion­wide clar­ion calls such as the 1968 Keep Sin­ga­pore Clean and the 1979 Cour­tesy cam­paigns, this sec­tion shows how Sin­ga­pore­ans have worked with com­mu­nity lead­ers through di­a­logues and ini­tia­tives.</p>
    <p>4 OPEN DOORS SEC­TION</p>
    <p>Open Doors takes a look at how Sin­ga­pore has been shaped by its im­mi­grant and mul­ti­cul­tural past through the sto­ries of peo­ple from dif­fer­ent lands who have made Sin­ga­pore their home over the years.</p>
    <p>Hear these sto­ries through video in­ter­views in a space at the ex­hibiton that is de­signed to look like an HDB void deck.</p>
    <p>5 STURDY THROUGH STORMS</p>
    <p>The fi­nal sec­tion shows how Sin­ga­pore has stood united through crises and challenges such as floods, the with­drawal of the Bri­tish mil­i­tary, fi­nan­cial crises and the Sars out­break.</p>
    <p>This sec­tion also in­cludes a spe­cial fea­ture on the on­go­ing Covid-19 pan­demic, with a dis­play of art­works, pho­tos and arte­facts, in­clud­ing con­tri­bu­tions from the Na­tional Mu­seum’s Col­lect­ing Con­tem­po­rary Sin­ga­pore: Doc­u­ment­ing Covid-19 In Sin­ga­pore Open Call.</p>
    <p>Home, Truly con­cludes with a space for re­flec­tion that in­vites vis­i­tors to con­trib­ute to a live col­lec­tive re­sponse on what “home” means to them by writ­ing or draw­ing on a re­sponse card, and see­ing it pro­jected on a screen. Vis­i­tors may also choose to re­spond via a spe­cial record­ing de­vice de­signed for the vis­ually im­paired.</p>
