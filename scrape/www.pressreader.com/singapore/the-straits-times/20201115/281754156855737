    <p>WASH­ING­TON • Al-Qaeda’s sec­ond in com­mand, ac­cused of be­ing one of the mas­ter­minds of the deadly 1998 at­tacks on US em­bassies in Africa, was killed in Iran three months ago, in­tel­li­gence of­fi­cials have con­firmed.</p>
    <p>Ab­dul­lah Ahmed Ab­dul­lah, who went by the nom de guerre Abu Muham­mad al-Masri, was gunned down in Te­heran by two as­sas­sins on a mo­tor­cy­cle on Aug 7, the an­niver­sary of the em­bassy at­tacks.</p>
    <p>Also killed was his daugh­ter, Miriam, the widow of Osama bin Laden’s son Hamza bin Laden.</p>
    <p>The at­tack was car­ried out by Is­raeli op­er­a­tives at the be­hest of the United States, ac­cord­ing to four of the of­fi­cials, the New York Times re­ported. It is un­clear what role if any was played by the US, which had been track­ing the move­ments of al-Masri and other Al-Qaeda op­er­a­tives in Iran for years.</p>
    <p>Iran yes­ter­day de­nied the re­port about the killing, say­ing there were no Al-Qaeda “ter­ror­ists” on its soil.</p>
    <p>For­eign Min­istry spokesman</p>
    <p>Saeed Khat­i­bzadeh said in a state­ment that the US and Is­rael some­times “try to tie Iran to such groups by ly­ing and leak­ing false in­for­ma­tion to the me­dia in or­der to avoid re­spon­si­bil­ity for the crim­i­nal ac­tiv­i­ties of this group and other ter­ror­ist groups in the re­gion”.</p>
    <p>He ac­cused the US and its al­lies of hav­ing cre­ated Al-Qaeda through their “wrong poli­cies” and ad­vised US me­dia to “not fall into the trap of Amer­i­can and Zion­ist of­fi­cials’ Hol­ly­wood sce­nar­ios”.</p>
    <p>The ad­min­is­tra­tion of US Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump’s “scare-mon­ger­ing tac­tic against Iran has be­come rou­tine”, he added.</p>
    <p>A US of­fi­cial, speak­ing to Reuters on con­di­tion of anonymity, de­clined to con­firm any de­tails of the Times’ story or say whether there was any Amer­i­can in­volve­ment. The killing oc­curred in such a nether­world of geopo­lit­i­cal in­trigue and coun­tert­er­ror­ism spy­craft that al-Masri’s death had been ru­moured but never con­firmed un­til now.</p>
    <p>For rea­sons that are still ob­scure, Al-Qaeda has not an­nounced the death of one of its top lead­ers, Ira­nian of­fi­cials cov­ered it up, and no coun­try has pub­licly claimed re­spon­si­bil­ity for it.</p>
    <p>Al-Masri, who was about 58, was one of Al-Qaeda’s found­ing lead­ers and was thought to be first in line to lead the or­gan­i­sa­tion after its cur­rent leader Ay­man al-Zawahiri.</p>
    <p>Long fea­tured on the Fed­eral Bureau of In­ves­ti­ga­tion’s (FBI) Most Wanted Ter­ror­ist list, he had been in­dicted in the US for crimes re­lated to the bomb­ings of the Amer­i­can em­bassies in Kenya and Tan­za­nia, which killed 224 peo­ple and wounded hun­dreds.</p>
    <p>The FBI of­fered a US$10 mil­lion (S$13.5 mil­lion) re­ward for in­for­ma­tion lead­ing to his cap­ture, and as at Friday, his pic­ture was still on the most-wanted list.</p>
    <p>Shi’ite Iran and Al-Qaeda, a Sunni Mus­lim mil­i­tant or­gan­i­sa­tion, have long been en­e­mies.</p>
    <p>Al-Masri had been in Iran’s “cus­tody” since 2003 but had been liv­ing freely in an up­scale sub­urb of Te­heran since 2015, the Times cited un­named US in­tel­li­gence of­fi­cials as say­ing.</p>
    <p>US coun­tert­er­ror­ism of­fi­cials be­lieve Iran, also a US en­emy, may have let him live there to con­duct op­er­a­tions against Amer­i­can tar­gets, the Times said.</p>
    <p>Al­though Al-Qaeda has been over­shad­owed in re­cent years by the rise of the Is­lamic State in Iraq and Syria, it re­mains re­silient and has ac­tive af­fil­i­ates around the globe, ac­cord­ing to a United Na­tions coun­tert­er­ror­ism re­port is­sued in July.</p>
    <p>Is­rael has said in the past that its in­tel­li­gence ser­vices have man­aged to pen­e­trate Iran in re­cent years, in­clud­ing say­ing in 2018 that it had smug­gled out an al­leged ar­chive of Ira­nian nu­clear se­crets.</p>
    <p>Some Amer­i­can an­a­lysts said alMasri’s death would sever con­nec­tions be­tween one of the last orig­i­nal Al-Qaeda lead­ers and the cur­rent gen­er­a­tion of Is­lamist mil­i­tants, who have grown up after Osama’s death in 2011.</p>
    <p>“If true, this fur­ther cuts links be­tween old-school Al-Qaeda and the modern ji­had,” said Mr Nicholas Ras­mussen, a for­mer di­rec­tor of the Na­tional Coun­tert­er­ror­ism Cen­tre. “It just fur­ther con­trib­utes to the frag­men­ta­tion and de­cen­tral­i­sa­tion of the Al-Qaeda move­ment.”</p>
