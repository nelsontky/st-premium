    <p>ELCHE (Spain) • Real Madrid coach Zine­dine Zi­dane was an­noyed his side could not seal vic­tory af­ter they were held to a 1-1 draw at Elche on Wed­nes­day to slip two points be­hind La Liga lead­ers and ri­vals Atletico Madrid.</p>
    <p>A Luka Mo­dric header put Real in front in the first half but they failed to build on their ad­van­tage and the hosts equalised with a Fidel Chaves penalty af­ter the break.</p>
    <p>“The sen­sa­tions are not good be­cause we had chances and could not kill the game,” Zi­dane told re­porters. “Once they scored, they closed up at the back and it was very dif­fi­cult for us.”</p>
    <p>Cham­pi­ons Real had won their previous six matches in all com­pe­ti­tions but Zi­dane dis­missed sug­ges­tions his side had been com­pla­cent against Elche, who are back in the top flight for the first time since 2015.</p>
    <p>“I don’t think we suf­fered from over­con­fi­dence, be­cause we know ex­actly what was at stake,” he said.</p>
    <p>“The key was find­ing the se­cond goal but we weren’t able to. It was much harder af­ter they equalised al­though we still cre­ated chances.</p>
    <p>“We’ve dropped two points to­day but we have to keep go­ing and think about our next game.”</p>
    <p>Next up for Real will be to­mor</p>
    <p>row’s home game against in-form Celta Vigo, who have won five of their last six matches and are un­beaten since Nov 21.</p>
    <p>While Real and Barcelona, who drew 1-1 with Eibar at home on Tues­day, con­tinue to floun­der in</p>
    <p>the ti­tle chase, Atletico keep chug­ging along.</p>
    <p>Luis Suarez fired them to a 1-0 home win over Getafe and Diego Sime­one’s men, on 35 points, still have two games in hand over Zi­dane’s side and a game in hand</p>
    <p>over the Cata­lans.</p>
    <p>The Ar­gen­tinian, into his 10th year with Atletico, re­flected on his 500th match in charge, say­ing: “When I got on the plane to come here, I thought that when I left the club (as a player) that I al­ways</p>
    <p>wanted to come back.</p>
    <p>“I found men like Koke, Saul Niguez who wanted to get the club out of the bad patch it was in, and I have a re­la­tion­ship with them that goes beyond foot­ball.”</p>
