    <p>SALLY YEH WANTS TO MEET HER FANS: Vet­eran singer Sally Yeh has not been ac­tive in the en­ter­tain­ment in­dus­try in re­cent years. Her hus­band, Hong Kong singer Ge­orge Lam (both right), is also semi-re­tired.</p>
    <p>Known for songs such as Cool</p>
    <p>Walk, Heart­bro­ken In The Past and A Woman’s Tears, Yeh turned 59 on Wed­nes­day and cel­e­brated the oc­ca­sion with her friends and fam­ily.</p>
    <p>On Thurs­day, she posted on so­cial me­dia sev­eral pic­tures of the cel­e­bra­tions as well as the gifts she re­ceived.</p>
    <p>The Tai­wan-born, Hong Kong­based singer wrote in Chi­nese and English: “I can’t be­lieve I am here at this junc­tion in my life. My last year in my big fives.</p>
    <p>“I have to say the last 19 years have been a spurt of amaz­ing lessons and rapid growth on life.</p>
    <p>I will very much cher­ish each sec­ond, minute, day, week and month of my 59th glo­ri­ous year.”</p>
    <p>She added that she wanted to show her grat­i­tude and ap­pre­ci­a­tion to fans who have been sup­port­ing her all these years.</p>
    <p>“Re­cently, some 20-odd fans who have been with me and stood by me all of these past decades had re­quested a Zoom bash, which I was very ex­cited to par­tic­i­pate in as I would be able to speak and in­ter­act with these now long-time friends, and hear what you all have to say.”</p>
    <p>She said the on­line meet­ing went well and she hoped to be able to in­ter­act with more fans in fu­ture.</p>
    <p>In fact, she said those who took part in the Zoom meet­ing were now plan­ning a hike, and she hoped more fans could join in and they could start ar­rang­ing an­nual or semi-an­nual get-to­geth­ers.</p>
    <p>Yeh has been mar­ried to Lam, 72, since 1996, af­ter his di­vorce from for­mer record pro­ducer Ng Cheng Yuen in 1994. Lam was orig­i­nally sched­uled to hold a con­cert in Sin­ga­pore in March, but it was post­poned to July, then can­celled due to the coro­n­avirus pan­demic.</p>
