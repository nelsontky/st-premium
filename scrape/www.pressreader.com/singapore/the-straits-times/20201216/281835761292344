    <p>BEI­JING/SYD­NEY China’s top eco­nomic plan­ner has granted ap­proval to power plants i n the coun­try to im­port coal with­out clear­ance re­stric­tions, ex­cept for Aus­tralia, Chi­nese me­dia has re­ported.</p>
    <p>Aus­tralia yes­ter­day urged China to clar­ify the re­ports in news out­lets, in­clud­ing The Global Times and Caixin, say­ing that if they were true, any re­stric­tions on Aus­tralian coal would be in breach of World Trade Or­gan­i­sa­tion (WTO) rules.</p>
    <p>Aus­tralian Prime Min­is­ter Scott Mor­ri­son said that any shift by China away from im­port­ing high­qual­ity Aus­tralian coal would be a “lose-lose” for the en­vi­ron­ment and their trad­ing re­la­tion­ship.</p>
    <p>Coal is the third-largest ex­port from Aus­tralia, which is in a diplo­matic row with China, its largest trad­ing part­ner. Bei­jing im­posed trade reprisals af­ter Can­berra called for an in­ter­na­tional in­quiry into the source of Covid-19.</p>
    <p>When asked about the re­ports, Mr Wang Wen­bin, a spokesman from China’s Min­istry of For­eign Af­fairs, told a reg­u­lar news brief­ing in Bei­jing yes­ter­day that he was not aware of the spe­cific sit­u­a­tion.</p>
    <p>“The com­pe­tent author­ity on the Chi­nese side has been adopt­ing rel­e­vant mea­sures on im­ported goods from Aus­tralia in ac­cor­dance with law as well as in­ter­na­tional prac­tices,” said Mr Wang.</p>
    <p>“It’s also a re­spon­si­ble way to pro­tect Chi­nese con­sumers and cus­tomers,” he added.</p>
    <p>China’s Na­tional De­vel­op­ment and Re­form Com­mis­sion and Gen­eral Ad­min­is­tra­tion of Cus­toms did not re­spond to re­quests for com­ment from Reuters.</p>
    <p>Mr Mor­ri­son said a shift away from Aus­tralian coal im­ports would be “a bad out­come for the en­vi­ron­ment”.</p>
    <p>“It re­ally is a lose-lose here be­cause Aus­tralian coal com­pared with coal that is sourced from other coun­tries, the other coun­tries have 50 per cent higher emis­sions than Aus­tralian coal,” Mr Mor­ri­son told me­dia out­lets.</p>
    <p>Although A$4 bil­lion (S$4 bil­lion) of the A$13 bil­lion in ther­mal coal ex­ports went to China, it was not Aus­tralia’s largest cus­tomer, Mr Mor­ri­son added.</p>
    <p>Trade Min­is­ter Si­mon Birm­ing­ham said there had been “a pat­tern of dis­rup­tion” of trade with China, and ves­sels had been de­layed in of­fload­ing Aus­tralian coal.</p>
    <p>Aus­tralia raised con­cerns at a WTO meet­ing about China tak­ing mea­sures against its bar­ley, wine, meat, dairy, live seafood, logs, tim­ber, coal and cot­ton.</p>
    <p>Bei­jing’s opaque ac­tion in the re­sources sec­tor in­volved “dis­rup­tion through use of state in­flu­ence with dif­fer­ent com­pa­nies”, Mr Birm­ing­ham said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Mr Wang said yes­ter­day that Aus­tralia was politi­cis­ing trade, in­vest­ment and sci­en­tific is­sues.</p>
    <p>“It has gone so far down the wrong road,” Mr Wang said.</p>
    <p>Min­er­als Coun­cil of Aus­tralia chief ex­ec­u­tive Tania Con­sta­ble said the suc­cess of Aus­tralia and China’s trade in min­er­als re­lied on a “rules-based trade sys­tem” and urged a restora­tion of sta­bil­ity to the re­la­tion­ship.</p>
    <p>The Chi­nese em­bassy last month out­lined griev­ances about re­stric­tions on in­vest­ment in Aus­tralia, and crit­i­cism of China by par­lia­men­tar­i­ans and the me­dia.</p>
    <p>Mr Mor­ri­son said Aus­tralia was a liberal democ­racy and his govern­ment would not back down.</p>
    <p>“If a per­cep­tion emerges that there is a con­fla­tion be­tween po­lit­i­cal is­sues and a trad­ing re­la­tion­ship... that can cre­ate a lot of un­cer­tainty for many other trad­ing part­ners,” he said.</p>
    <p>Aus­tralia’s ther­mal coal ex­ports are ex­pected to hold up rel­a­tively well as buy­ers were be­ing found in</p>
    <p>South Korea, Viet­nam and Ja­pan, said ANZ com­mod­ity strate­gists Daniel Hynes and Soni Ku­mari.</p>
    <p>Aus­tralia is the top iron ore sup­plier to China, whose steel pro­duc­ers called on the mar­ket reg­u­la­tor to in­ves­ti­gate a re­cent jump in prices and crack down on any wrong­do­ing.</p>
    <p>Aus­tralian Prime Min­is­ter Scott Mor­ri­son said that any shift by China away from im­port­ing high-qual­ity Aus­tralian coal would be a “lose-lose” for the en­vi­ron­ment and their trad­ing re­la­tion­ship.</p>
