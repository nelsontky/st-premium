    <p>While more dorms will be built in the com­ing months, con­trac­tors anxious to re­sume busi­ness have taken the ini­tia­tive in the mean­time to ap­ply to build tem­po­rary quar­ters for their work­ers on work sites.</p>
    <p>Some 25,000 bed spa­ces for such con­struc­tion tem­po­rary quar­ters (CTQs) have been ap­proved, the Min­istry of Man­power (MOM) and Min­istry of Na­tional Devel­op­ment (MND) said in re­sponse to queries from The Straits Times.</p>
    <p>The min­istries also said an­other 25,000 beds in Quick Build Dor­mi­to­ries (QBDs) are in the pipe­line to re­duce the den­sity of work­ers in dorms. Such QBDs are semi-per­ma­nent and last for two to three years.</p>
    <p>But new stan­dards and spec­i­fi­ca­tions for QBDs are still be­ing dis­cussed with stake­hold­ers, such as dorm op­er­a­tors and health ex­perts, said MOM and MND, adding that more con­sul­ta­tions will be held next month.</p>
    <p>Last month, it was re­ported that QBDs will have no more than 10 beds per room, with only sin­gledeck beds and 1m spac­ing between them. Not more than five peo­ple will share a toi­let, bath­room and sink, com­pared with 15 peo­ple cur­rently. Each res­i­dent will have 6 sq m of liv­ing space, com­pared with 4.5 sq m now.</p>
    <p>MOM and MND said early feed­back from some dor­mi­tory op­er­a­tors sug­gests that they are gen­er­ally sup­port­ive of cap­ping the num­ber of work­ers per room and in­creas­ing the liv­ing space per res­i­dent to help re­duce the ex­tent of trans­mis­sion dur­ing a dis­ease out­break.</p>
    <p>The min­istries also said slight vari­a­tions on some of th­ese pro­posed changes to con­fig­u­ra­tions could first be tested in se­lect QBDs.</p>
    <p>As for CTQs, MOM’s web­site spec­i­fies that they are al­lowed to house a max­i­mum of 300 peo­ple each, though ap­peals can be made for higher oc­cu­pancy.</p>
    <p>There are two types of CTQs. The first are quar­ters lo­cated within an un­com­pleted per­ma­nent build­ing still un­der con­struc­tion. Th­ese are al­lowed to house only for­eign work­ers in the con­struc­tion sec­tor.</p>
    <p>The sec­ond are stand­alone, tem­po­rary quar­ters within the con­struc­tion project site that will even­tu­ally be re­moved. They are to house only for­eign con­struc­tion work­ers en­gaged at the par­tic­u­lar site.</p>
    <p>Re­quire­ments from var­i­ous gov­ern­ment agen­cies need to be met be­fore such quar­ters are al­lowed to be built as hous­ing for work­ers.</p>
    <p>Af­ter first ap­ply­ing to the Build­ing and Con­struc­tion Author­ity, the firms must get MOM’s go-ahead be­fore they can start build­ing the quar­ters. They also need to get ap­proval from the Na­tional En­vi­ron­ment Agency for san­i­ta­tion fa­cil­i­ties, and na­tional wa­ter agency PUB for wa­ter sup­ply and sew­er­age.</p>
    <p>As a tem­po­rary ex­emp­tion to speed up ap­pli­ca­tions for the Covid-19 pe­riod, a Sin­ga­pore-reg­is­tered qual­i­fied per­son (QP) does not need to get build­ing plans ap­proved by the Sin­ga­pore Civil De­fence Force (SCDF).</p>
    <p>In gen­eral, de­sign and su­per­vi­sion QPs are re­spon­si­ble for com­ing up with build­ing plans and check­ing that con­struc­tion works are car­ried out as spec­i­fied.</p>
    <p>But the plans for tem­po­rary quar­ters must be cer­ti­fied by the rel­e­vant au­thor­i­ties and avail­able on site at all times for in­spec­tion by MOM and SCDF of­fi­cers.</p>
    <p>As a tem­po­rary ex­emp­tion to speed up ap­pli­ca­tions for the Covid-19 pe­riod, a Sin­ga­pore-reg­is­tered qual­i­fied per­son does not need to get build­ing plans ap­proved by the Sin­ga­pore Civil De­fence Force.</p>
