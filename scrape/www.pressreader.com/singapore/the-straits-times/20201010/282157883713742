    <p>KEEP­ING COUN­TRY AT­TRAC­TIVE</p>
    <p>These ef­forts will en­sure that Sin­ga­pore re­mains a safe, trusted and pre­ferred des­ti­na­tion for all our vis­i­tors. ’’</p>
    <p>SIN­GA­PORE TOURISM BOARD CHIEF EX­EC­U­TIVE KEITH TAN, on the col­lab­o­ra­tion be­tween DBS and STB.</p>
    <p>Do­mes­tic tourism could get a wel­come boost, thanks to an ini­tia­tive by the Sin­ga­pore Tourism Board (STB) and DBS Bank.</p>
    <p>Their three-year tie-up will lever­age DBS ser­vices – its travel mar­ket­place por­tal, dig­i­tal pay­ments ser­vice, predictive an­a­lyt­ics and its DBS PayLah! app – to “help the tourism in­dus­try seize new op­por­tu­ni­ties”.</p>
    <p>DBS and STB will also help lo­cal small and medium-sized en­ter­prises (SMEs) in the sec­tor to ac­cel­er­ate their dig­i­tal trans­for­ma­tion.</p>
    <p>Part of the ini­tia­tive in­volves the tourism board and DBS in­vest­ing in mar­ket­ing cam­paigns for home­grown prod­ucts and ex­pe­ri­ences.</p>
    <p>These will com­ple­ment the Sin­gapoRedis­cov­ers cam­paign launched in July and led by the STB, En­ter­prise Sin­ga­pore and Sen­tosa De­vel­op­ment.</p>
    <p>DBS and STB will cu­rate pro­mo­tional bun­dles for at­trac­tions, tours and ho­tel stays.</p>
    <p>The bank will also em­ploy its predictive an­a­lyt­ics and in­tel­li­gent­bank­ing ca­pa­bil­i­ties to pro­vide per­son­alised itin­er­ar­ies and des­ti­na­tion con­tent to en­cour­age lo­cals to ex­plore the coun­try’s dif­fer­ent precincts and learn about the myr­iad home-grown brands and ex­pe­ri­ences.</p>
    <p>And both par­ties will cre­ate con­tent to in­crease aware­ness of tourism ex­pe­ri­ences and brands.</p>
    <p>This will be am­pli­fied across DBS’ plat­forms, in­clud­ing its travel mar­ket­place, so­cial me­dia com­mu­ni­ties such as The Bur­row, and mar­ket­ing chan­nels.</p>
    <p>The next phase of the part­ner­ship will tar­get in­bound vis­i­tors through in­ter­na­tional mar­ket­ing cam­paigns as Sin­ga­pore pro­gres­sively opens its bor­ders.</p>
    <p>Sim­i­lar to their tie-up for the do­mes­tic mar­ket, DBS and STB will cus­tomise con­tent and in­tro­duce pro­mo­tions and prod­ucts for in­ter­na­tional vis­i­tors such as flight and ac­com­mo­da­tion bun­dles, business events and travel in­sur­ance plans.</p>
    <p>DBS and STB will help home­grown tourism SMEs trans­form dig­i­tally so they can reach cus­tomers more eas­ily and boost cus­tomer en­gage­ment in the light of the shift of ev­ery­day pay­ment and bank­ing needs to mo­bile phones and on­line plat­forms.</p>
    <p>DBS and the STB will part­ner lo­cal busi­nesses to pi­lot smart ex­pe­ri­ences such as con­tact­less dig­i­tal pay­ments at var­i­ous precincts, for in­stance.</p>
    <p>As a start, they will launch a cam­paign to en­cour­age the use of DBS PayLah! within the Bugis precinct by the end of the year.</p>
    <p>This pi­lot will in­volve mer­chants such as the Eigh­teen Chefs restau­rant. Man­ag­ing di­rec­tor Roger Wong said he hopes to in­cen­tivise cus­tomers to use cash­less pay­ments by of­fer­ing them cash­back re­wards.</p>
    <p>DBS Sin­ga­pore coun­try head Shee Tse Koon said the three-year col­lab­o­ra­tion will help the tourism in­dus­try get back on its feet.</p>
    <p>“In ad­di­tion, we look for­ward to sup­port­ing our lo­cal SMEs by lever­ag­ing our cus­tomer base, data in­sights and tech­nol­ogy to help them build up their re­silience and un­lock more business op­por­tu­ni­ties,” he added.</p>
    <p>STB chief ex­ec­u­tive Keith Tan said the part­ner­ship will reach a large com­mu­nity of lo­cal and in­ter­na­tional con­sumers, and en­cour­age them to dis­cover and sup­port lo­cal tourism busi­nesses.</p>
    <p>“These ef­forts will en­sure that Sin­ga­pore re­mains a safe, trusted and pre­ferred des­ti­na­tion for all our vis­i­tors,” Mr Tan added.</p>
