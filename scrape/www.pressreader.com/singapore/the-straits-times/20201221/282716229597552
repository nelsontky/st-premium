    <p>Au­thor Joyceline See Tully, mother of a seven-year-old girl, wants kids to l earn more about Sin­ga­pore his­tory.</p>
    <p>Launched this month, her fourth chil­dren’s book is once again in­spired by real events that hap­pened in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>Tiger Tales: Al­most True An­i­mal Sto­ries From Old Sin­ga­pore com­prises seven semi-fic­tion­alised sto­ries, in­clud­ing the dra­matic story of a Ben­gal tiger that es­caped into Raf­fles Ho­tel in Au­gust 1902.</p>
    <p>Il­lus­trated by Chloe Chang, the hard­cover book is aimed at read­ers aged four to eight.</p>
    <p>“I picked in­ter­est­ing events and sto­ries about an­i­mals that are un­usual yet rep­re­sen­ta­tive of spe­cific pe­ri­ods of our his­tory,” says Tully.</p>
    <p>“At the same time, they must have the po­ten­tial to be de­vel­oped into full-fledged sto­ries that will ap­peal to young chil­dren. I did not want to merely re­count a his­tor­i­cal event. I wanted to make it come alive for the kids.”</p>
    <p>On why it is i mpor­tant for chil­dren to learn about Sin­ga­pore his­tory, the 46-year-old says: “Sto­ries of Sin­ga­pore’s past show us how dif­fer­ent life was back then and how far we have come. Hope­fully for the chil­dren, it is an op­por­tu­nity to see their coun­try in a new light, one that leads to a new ap­pre­ci­a­tion of Sin­ga­pore.”</p>
    <p>This was also why she co-founded a bou­tique chil­dren’s pub­lisher with fel­low for­mer mag­a­zine jour­nal­ist Sim Ee Waun in 2015.</p>
    <p>“When we set up Pep­per Dog Press, the lo­cal pub­lish­ing land­scape was very dif­fer­ent. There were very few sto­ries about our past for chil­dren.</p>
    <p>“So, we pub­lished The Lit­tle Sin­ga­pore Book, which takes kids through 700 years of Sin­ga­pore’s his­tory in a sim­ple, fun, sto­ry­telling fash­ion, rather than via a pedan­tic text­book.”</p>
    <p>She cred­its her only child Do­minique Tully, who loves an­i­mals, for in­spir­ing her to work on Tiger Tales. “These days, we read to­gether at bed­time and some of the lines in Tiger Tales were in­spired by these ses­sions.</p>
    <p>“Tiger Tales is meant to be read aloud – hence the di­a­logue, rhymes and an­i­mal sounds,” she says.</p>
    <p>“I joke that I am pac­ing and writ­ing my books for her. One day in the not-too-distant fu­ture, I will be writ­ing young-adult fic­tion.”</p>
    <p>• Tiger Tales: Al­most True An­i­mal Sto­ries From Old Sin­ga­pore ($25) is avail­able at book­shops in­clud­ing Books Ki­noku­niya.</p>
    <p>• This is part of a se­ries in which ex­perts give tips on how to get kids to love read­ing.</p>
