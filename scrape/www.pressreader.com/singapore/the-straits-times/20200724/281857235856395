    <p>In­done­sia is set to re­lax prop­erty rules soon to make it eas­ier for for­eign­ers to own homes in the coun­try, a Cabi­net min­is­ter said yes­ter­day, in a ma­jor change that could spur the slump­ing econ­omy.</p>
    <p>Agrar­ian and Spa­tial Plan­ning</p>
    <p>Min­is­ter So­fyan Djalil told prop­erty ty­coons in a we­bi­nar that the new prop­erty rules – set to be rat­i­fied into law by the end of next month – will al­low for­eign­ers to have prac­ti­cally the same rights as In­done­sian prop­erty buy­ers.</p>
    <p>“On this for­eign own­er­ship mat­ter… we will have (the Bill that cov­ers the mat­ter) rat­i­fied into law by end-Au­gust,” Mr So­fyan said in the on­line sem­i­nar at­tended by the coun­try’s top prop­erty ty­coons.</p>
    <p>“That is the com­mit­ment from Par­lia­ment, and Pres­i­dent Joko Wi­dodo had re­quested that such a time­line to be the dead­line.”</p>
    <p>Among the par­tic­i­pants were Mr James Ri­ady of the Lippo Group, Mr Muk­tar Wid­jaja of the Si­nar Mas Group and Mr Su­gianto Kusuma of the Agung Se­dayu group.</p>
    <p>The gov­ern­ment’s plan to loosen the prop­erty rules comes amid the coro­n­avirus pan­demic that has shrunk the econ­omy and caused mas­sive job losses.</p>
    <p>The In­done­sian prop­erty sec­tor sup­ports at least 170 other in­dushad come to kill Gul’s father, who was the vil­lage chief, be­cause he sup­ported the gov­ern­ment.</p>
    <p>The in­sur­gents reg­u­larly kill vil­lagers they sus­pect of be­ing in­form­ers for the gov­ern­ment or se­cu­rity forces, with Tay­wara dis­trict, where Gul’s re­mote vil­lage is lo­cated, the scene of near-daily clashes be­tween gov­ern­ment forces and the Tale­ban.</p>
    <p>“I am proud I killed my par­ents’ mur­der­ers,” she said. “I killed them be­cause they killed my par­ents, and also be­cause I knew they would come for me and my lit­tle brother.”</p>
    <p>Gul re­grets she was un­able to say good­bye to her mother and father. “Af­ter I killed the two Tale­ban (mil­i­tants), I went to talk to my par­ents, but they were not breath­ing,” she said.</p>
    <p>Hun­dreds of peo­ple on so­cial me­dia are de­mand­ing the gov­ern­ment pro­tect her, with some call­ing for her to be sent out­side of Afghanista­n.</p>
    <p>“I de­mand that the Pres­i­dent help trans­fer her to a safe place as her and her fam­ily’s se­cu­rity is at tries rang­ing from ce­ment and steel to the cre­ative in­dus­tries such as in­te­rior decor. The sec­tor em­ploys more than 30 mil­lion peo­ple or about 11 per cent of the coun­try’s pop­u­la­tion.</p>
    <p>For­eign­ers are cur­rently al­lowed to buy apart­ments, but not landed homes, in In­done­sia and they get only 30-year lease­hold ti­tles for these units, mak­ing it tough to get bank loans.</p>
    <p>The 30-year lease is ex­tend­able by an­other 20 years upon ap­pli­ca­tion. Buy­ers could also later ap­ply for an ad­di­tional 30-year ex­ten­sion to the lease atop the 50-year lease. risk,” prom­i­nent women’s rights ac­tivist and for­mer law­maker Fawzia Koofi wrote on Face­book.</p>
    <p>Ms Munera Yousufzada, a de­fence min­istry of­fi­cial, said on Twit­ter: “The Tale­ban must re­alise and know that to­day’s women are dif­fer­ent than the women dur­ing their rule.”</p>
    <p>A Tale­ban spokesman has con­firmed an op­er­a­tion took place in the area of the at­tack, but de­nied any of the group’s fight­ers had been killed by a woman.</p>
    <p>But this has posed a big stum­bling block for for­eign buy­ers and soured de­mand, as In­done­sian law could change in be­tween their ap­pli­ca­tions.</p>
    <p>In con­trast, In­done­sians who buy prop­erty in the coun­try gen­er­ally get free­hold ten­ure to their homes, or lease­hold ti­tles with guar­an­teed ex­ten­sion to the ten­ure.</p>
    <p>Fur­ther, in many for­eign coun­tries such as Sin­ga­pore and Malaysia, lease­hold ti­tles have terms of more than 90 years at one go.</p>
    <p>Mr So­fyan said Pres­i­dent Joko and the gov­ern­ment are con­cerned with the cur­rent in­flex­i­ble clauses of own­er­ship and want them changed.</p>
    <p>He said that the ad­min­is­tra­tion is keen to up­grade the own­er­ship ti­tle sta­tus given to for­eign­ers when buy­ing homes.</p>
    <p>But Mr So­fyan did not say if the ex­pected amend­ment to the law would al­low non-In­done­sians to also buy landed houses.</p>
    <p>For­eign­ers are cur­rently al­lowed to buy apart­ments, but not landed homes, in In­done­sia and they get only 30-year lease­hold ti­tles for these units, mak­ing it tough to get bank loans.</p>
