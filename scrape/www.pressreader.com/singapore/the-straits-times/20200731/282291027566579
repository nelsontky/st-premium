    <p>A TRICKY SIT­U­A­TION</p>
    <p>Now I see that the sit­u­a­tion in New York is get­ting bet­ter, much bet­ter. But at the same time I think it’s very much about travel re­stric­tions... You can’t have a Grand Slam which is the Na­tional US cham­pi­onships, right? ’’</p>
    <p>PA­TRICK MOURATOGLO­U, coach of Ser­ena Wil­liams, on the need for the US Open to ad­dress in­ter­na­tional play­ers’ health con­cerns.</p>
    <p>SYD­NEY • World No. 1 Ash­leigh Barty pulled out of the US Open yes­ter­day over fears about the coro­n­avirus pan­demic in a ma­jor blow for the Grand Slam which is sched­uled to start in New York on Aug 31.</p>
    <p>The Aus­tralian is the big­gest name so far to with­draw from the tour­na­ment, with her de­ci­sion com­ing as the United States marked a grim mile­stone when its Covid-19 deaths topped 150,000.</p>
    <p>The last time the US Open be­gan with­out the top women’s sin­gles player was 2010, when Ser­ena</p>
    <p>Wil­liams with­drew be­cause of in­jury.</p>
    <p>“My team and I have de­cided that we won’t be trav­el­ling to the US for the West­ern and South­ern Open and the US Open this year,” Barty told Aus­tralian me­dia.</p>
    <p>“I love both events so it was a dif­fi­cult de­ci­sion but there are still sig­nif­i­cant risks in­volved due to Covid-19 and I don’t feel com­fort­able putting my team and I in that po­si­tion.”</p>
    <p>The 24-year-old last month ex­pressed con­cerns about the</p>
    <p>US Open go­ing ahead, and she won plenty of sup­port on so­cial me­dia yes­ter­day for her “sen­si­ble” de­ci­sion to give it a miss.</p>
    <p>Barty, who reached the fourth round of the US Open in the last two years, said she would con­tinue to mon­i­tor the sit­u­a­tion be­fore de­cid­ing whether to travel to Europe to pre­pare for a de­fence of her French Open crown.</p>
    <p>Barty was one of sev­eral lead­ing play­ers not on the en­try list on Wednes­day for the ATP and WTA West­ern and South­ern Open from Aug 20-28, a tune-up event for the US Open set in a quar­an­tine en­vi­ron­ment with­out spec­ta­tors at Flush­ing Mead­ows.</p>
    <p>Oth­ers miss­ing in­cluded world</p>
    <p>No. 2 Si­mona Halep of Ro­ma­nia, the reign­ing Wim­ble­don cham­pion, fifth-ranked Elina Svi­tolina of Ukraine, and last year’s US Open cham­pion, Canada’s sixth-ranked Bianca An­dreescu.</p>
    <p>Whether they play the US Open re­mains to be seen.</p>
    <p>In con­trast, top-ranked No­vak Djokovic, the reign­ing Wim­ble­don and Aus­tralian Open cham­pion, and world No. 2 Rafael Nadal, the cur­rent US Open cham­pion, were among the men’s en­tries, sig­nalling their likely in­tent to play the Grand Slam. Also on the list was Barty’s com­pa­triot Nick Kyr­gios, who last month blasted the ATP as “self­ish” for press­ing ahead with plans for the US Open.</p>
    <p>Aus­tralia’s re­stric­tions on in­ter­na­tional travel have been a con­cern, with Aus­tralian cit­i­zens re­quir­ing an ex­emp­tion to leave the coun­try and then be­ing re­quired to quar­an­tine for 14 days upon re­turn­ing.</p>
    <p>Euro­pean play­ers are also wor­ried that un­der­go­ing manda­tory quar­an­tine upon re­turn­ing to their con­ti­nent will force them to miss high-pro­file tour­na­ments in Madrid and Rome ahead of the French Open at the end of Septem­ber.</p>
    <p>French­man Pa­trick Mouratoglo­u, the long-time coach of Wil­liams, be­lieves the US Open must not turn into a na­tional cham­pi­onships and or­gan­is­ers need to ad­dress play­ers’ health con­cerns by next week.</p>
    <p>New York re­ported l ess than 5,000 new coro­n­avirus cases last week, an im­prove­ment since spik­ing in March and April while ar­eas such as Florida, Texas and Cal­i­for­nia have be­come hotspots.</p>
    <p>“Now I see that the sit­u­a­tion in New York is get­ting bet­ter, much bet­ter,” Mouratoglo­u said. “But at the same time I think it’s very much about travel re­stric­tions...</p>
    <p>“What about the South Amer­i­cans? Are they now al­lowed to travel or not? What about the Aus­tralians?</p>
    <p>“You can’t have a Grand Slam which is the Na­tional US cham­pi­onships, right? So, we have to know.”</p>
