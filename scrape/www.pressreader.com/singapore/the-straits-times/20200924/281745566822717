    <p>The num­ber of cases in dor­mi­to­ries should con­tinue to fall as work­ers un­dergo mul­ti­ple cy­cles of tests, Ed­u­ca­tion Min­is­ter Lawrence Wong said at a vir­tual press con­fer­ence yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Mr Wong, who co-chairs the multi-min­istry task force tack­ling Covid-19, was re­spond­ing to a ques­tion on whether it would be pos­si­ble to see zero cases among for­eign work­ers soon.</p>
    <p>The Min­istry of Man­power had ear­lier de­clared all dor­mi­to­ries clear of Covid-19 on Aug 20.</p>
    <p>But since then, new cases have been re­ported in the dor­mi­to­ries on a daily ba­sis, usu­ally num­ber­ing in the dou­ble dig­its.</p>
    <p>Ac­knowl­edg­ing this, Mr Wong said yes­ter­day: “We started by do­ing a com­plete clear­ance of all the dor­mi­to­ries and the work­ers... but as we high­lighted and shared be­fore, de­spite do­ing it as com­pre­hen­sively as we can, no test can be fool­proof.</p>
    <p>“Even the best test is not 100 per cent sen­si­tive. So there will be a very, very low level of on­go­ing trans­mis­sion.”</p>
    <p>He added that one way to man­age this trans­mis­sion is by en­sur­ing that safe man­age­ment mea­sures are prac­tised at dor­mi­to­ries and work sites. Be­sides that, a “very ex­ten­sive” regime of reg­u­lar and rou­tine test­ing of work­ers will also help pick up pos­i­tive cases, said Mr Wong.</p>
    <p>This was done ear­lier dur­ing the pan­demic for es­sen­tial work­ers who were moved out of dor­mi­to­ries to live in tem­po­rary hous­ing.</p>
    <p>Mr Wong said: “In or­der to en­sure ev­ery­one’s safety, we tested them one time, but then we put them through a sec­ond test, a third test. And even in the sec­ond and third cy­cles for that group of work­ers... we con­tin­ued to pick up pos­i­tive cases.”</p>
    <p>He noted that work­ers in the dor­mi­to­ries are now in a sim­i­lar po­si­tion, but that as more cy­cles of test­ing are com­pleted, the num­ber of new cases should fall steadily.</p>
    <p>“So we are work­ing on all fronts, and we hope to see the num­bers con­tinue to de­cline,” he added.</p>
    <p>But Health Min­is­ter Gan Kim Yong, who co-chairs the task force with Mr Wong, said that just be­cause no cases are de­tected in the dor­mi­to­ries or the com­mu­nity does not mean there are no Covid-19 cases in Sin­ga­pore, as there could still be un­de­tected or asymp­to­matic cases lurk­ing.</p>
    <p>Even the ros­tered rou­tine test­ing ( RRT) that work­ers go through is not fool­proof as it takes place on a 14-day cy­cle, and work­ers may get in­fected in be­tween tests and the in­fec­tion may not be picked up un­til their next RRT, said Mr Gan.</p>
    <p>This is why the fre­quency of RRT is be­ing in­creased for cer­tain high-risk groups. For in­stance, at Toh Guan Dor­mi­tory, a pi­lot pro­gramme will see work­ers tested once a week, in­stead of once ev­ery 14 days. But even then, the num­bers may not drop to zero, Mr Gan added.</p>
    <p>“There’s no pos­si­bil­ity of zero cases in the whole of Sin­ga­pore un­til we have a vac­cine avail­able... Even if we one day see zero cases in the dor­mi­to­ries and zero cases in the com­mu­nity, we can­not af­ford to cel­e­brate be­cause the day af­ter that, it may not be zero,” he said, stress­ing the need for con­tin­ued vig­i­lance.</p>
