    <p>Peo­ple should get two doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech vac­cine within 21 to 28 days, the World Health Or­gan­i­sa­tion (WHO) has said, as many coun­tries strug­gle to ad­min­is­ter the jabs to ward off Covid-19 cases.</p>
    <p>Vac­cines are seen as the best way out of the global health cri­sis. But with jabs in lim­ited sup­ply, the WHO has been ex­am­in­ing how to use them ef­fec­tively. It said coun­tries should have lee­way to spread out the shots over six weeks so that more peo­ple at higher risk can get them.</p>
    <p>Peo­ple should get two doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech vac­cine within 21 to 28 days, the World Health Or­gan­i­sa­tion (WHO) has said, as many coun­tries strug­gled to ad­min­is­ter the jabs that can ward off Covid-19.</p>
    <p>Many are ex­pe­ri­enc­ing in­ten­si­fy­ing pres­sure on their health ser­vices due to surg­ing coro­n­avirus cases and the emer­gence of new vari­ants that ap­pear to spread more eas­ily.</p>
    <p>Gov­ern­ments are fac­ing mas­sive de­mand for vac­cines, which are seen as the best way out of the global health cri­sis.</p>
    <p>But with jabs in lim­ited sup­ply, the WHO has been ex­am­in­ing how they can be used most ef­fec­tively.</p>
    <p>“We de­lib­er­ated and came out with the fol­low­ing rec­om­men­da­tion: two doses of this (Pfizer) vac­cine within 21 to 28 days,” Dr Alejan­dro Cravioto, chair­man of WHO’s Strate­gic Ad­vi­sory Group of Ex­perts on Im­mu­ni­sa­tion (Sage), said on Tues­day.</p>
    <p>The panel added that coun­tries should have lee­way to spread out shots over six weeks so that more peo­ple at higher risk of ill­ness can get them.</p>
    <p>“Sage made a pro­vi­sion for coun­tries in ex­cep­tional cir­cum­stances of (Pfizer) vac­cine sup­ply con­straints to de­lay the ad­min­is­tra­tion of the sec­ond dose for a few weeks, in or­der to max­imise the num­ber of in­di­vid­u­als ben­e­fit­ing from a first dose,” Dr Cravioto said.</p>
    <p>“I think we have to be a bit open</p>
    <p>to these types of de­ci­sions which coun­tries have to make ac­cord­ing to their own epi­demi­o­log­i­cal sit­u­a­tions.”</p>
    <p>More than 86 mil­lion peo­ple have been re­ported to be in­fected with Covid-19 glob­ally, and around 1.87 mil­lion have died.</p>
    <p>Sage ex­ec­u­tive sec­re­tary Joachim Hombach said spac­ing out the two Pfizer in­oc­u­la­tions could be ac­cept­able for coun­tries un­able to im­ple­ment the main rec­om­men­da­tion.</p>
    <p>“We... to­tally ac­knowl­edge that coun­tries may see needs to be even more flex­i­ble in terms of ad­min­is­tra­tion of the sec­ond dose. But it is im­por­tant to note that there is very lit­tle... em­pir­i­cal data from the tri­als that un­der­pin this type of rec­om­men­da­tion,” he added.</p>
    <p>Five Bri­tish med­i­cal sci­en­tists have crit­i­cised the Bri­tish gov­ern­ment’s plan to de­lay giv­ing sec­ond doses by up to 12 weeks, say­ing that proven dos­ing sched­ules should not be al­tered “with­out solid sci­en­tific sup­port or ev­i­dence”.</p>
    <p>In an opin­ion piece pub­lished in the Bri­tish Med­i­cal Jour­nal (BMJ), the sci­en­tists from the univer­si­ties of Nottingham, Manch­ester and De Mont­fort wrote that sug­ges­tions by of­fi­cials on the gov­ern­ment’s Joint Com­mit­tee on Vac­ci­na­tion and Im­mu­ni­sa­tion (JCVI) that the de­lay strat­egy was due to short­ages of Covid-19 shots were “dis­puted by vac­cine man­u­fac­tur­ers”.</p>
    <p>“The JCVI ad­vice... to de­lay the sec­ond dose to be­tween four and 12 weeks is not based on data from the trial, but on an as­sump­tion of what would have hap­pened if the sec­ond dose hadn’t been given at 21 days,” they wrote in the BMJ.</p>
    <p>“While as­sump­tions can be use­ful for gen­er­at­ing a hy­poth­e­sis, alone they are not a suf­fi­cient rea­son to al­ter a known ef­fec­tive dos­ing reg­i­men.”</p>
    <p>More than one mil­lion peo­ple in Eng­land, or one per­son in ev­ery 50, now have the coro­n­avirus, the Bri­tish gov­ern­ment has said.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, sci­en­tists at the Na­tional In­sti­tutes of Health and Moderna may take about two months to de­ter­mine whether doses of the com­pany’s Covid-19 vac­cine can be halved to dou­ble the sup­ply of shots in the United States, ac­cord­ing to the agency.</p>
    <p>The US has been con­sid­er­ing the move to halve doses for Moderna’s vac­cine, which re­quires two in­jec­tions, to free up sup­ply for more vac­ci­na­tions.</p>
    <p>We... to­tally ac­knowl­edge that coun­tries may see needs to be even more flex­i­ble in terms of ad­min­is­tra­tion of the sec­ond dose. But it is im­por­tant to note that there is very lit­tle... em­pir­i­cal data from the tri­als that un­der­pin this type of rec­om­men­da­tion.</p>
