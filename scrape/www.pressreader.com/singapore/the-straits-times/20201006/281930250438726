    <p>NAPA (Cal­i­for­nia) • Wild­fires in Cal­i­for­nia have burned more than 1.6 mil­lion ha this year, more than twice the pre­vi­ous record for any year and an area larger than Con­necti­cut, the state’s fire agency re­ported on Sun­day.</p>
    <p>The most pop­u­lous US state has suf­fered five of its six largest wild­fires in his­tory this year as heat waves and dry-light­ning sieges co­in­cided with drier con­di­tions blamed on global warm­ing.</p>
    <p>At least 31 peo­ple have died in this year’s fires and more than 8,454 homes and other struc­tures have been de­stroyed, said the Cal­i­for­nia De­part­ment of Forestry and Fire Pro­tec­tion (Cal Fire).</p>
    <p>Cal­i­for­nia’s pre­vi­ous record burn area was about 809,370 ha in 2018, when deadly and de­struc­tive wild­fires killed at least 85 civil­ians and de­stroyed nearly 19,000 struc­tures in and around the moun­tain town of Par­adise.</p>
    <p>“There’re no words to describe what is tak­ing place and what con­tin­ues to take place,” said Cal Fire spokesman Scott McLean. “It goes to show how dry the state is and how volatile the veg­e­ta­tion is.”</p>
    <p>Cal­i­for­nia suf­fered a pro­longed drought from around 2010 to 2017, caus­ing dis­eases and in­sect in­fes­ta­tions that killed mil­lions of trees. That fol­lowed a cen­tury of fire sup­pres­sion that also built up brush and dead trees, turn­ing some forests into tin­der­boxes.</p>
    <p>City real-es­tate prices and sec­ond-home con­struc­tion have seen the growth of com­mu­ni­ties in pe­riph­eral, wild land ar­eas that have nat­u­rally burned for mil­len­nia.</p>
    <p>In the world-fa­mous Napa County, the so-called Glass Fire has dam­aged more than a dozen winer­ies. Vine­yards worked through the night last Satur­day to pick grape va­ri­eties that could re­sist smoke dam­age. Some crops heav­ily ex­posed to smoke may be a write-off.</p>
    <p>Fire­fight­ers were ex­pected to get a break from cooler tem­per­a­tures in North­ern Cal­i­for­nia this week, with a chance of rain.</p>
    <p>Cal­i­for­nia’s pre­vi­ous record burn area was about 809,370 ha when deadly and de­struc­tive wild­fires killed at least 85 civil­ians and de­stroyed nearly 19,000 struc­tures in and around the moun­tain town of Par­adise.</p>
