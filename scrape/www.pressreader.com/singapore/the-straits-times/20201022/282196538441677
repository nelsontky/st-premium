    <p>Staff used to spend time col­lect­ing data man­u­ally from ma­chines that were at risk of un­planned stop­pages on an au­to­mated pro­duc­tion line at Seng Hua Hng Food­stuff, which man­u­fac­tures the pop­u­lar Camel Nuts prod­ucts.</p>
    <p>But these prob­lems were re­solved af­ter the com­pany was rec­om­mended by JTC Cor­po­ra­tion to join an In­dus­try 4.0 hu­man cap­i­tal ini­tia­tive en­abler pro­gramme by the Sin­ga­pore Busi­ness Fed­er­a­tion.</p>
    <p>Through the pro­gramme, the com­pany could iden­tify and in­stall a dig­i­tal per­for­mance en­gine that al­lowed it to col­lect data in real time and mon­i­tor the per­for­mance of the au­to­mated pack­ag­ing pro­duc­tion line.</p>
    <p>Manag­ing direc­tor Poh Ah Seng said: “Through the data col­lected, we iden­ti­fied the causes of pro­duc­tiv­ity losses. We found op­por­tu­ni­ties for im­prove­ment in our changeover process and per­for­mance mon­i­tor­ing.</p>
    <p>“We were able to use the data to mea­sure ac­tual process time against stan­dard process time, and set mea­sur­able key per­for­mance in­di­ca­tors to mon­i­tor our ma­chine op­er­a­tors.”</p>
    <p>Pre­vi­ously, he said, the com­pany’s key prob­lems in­volved the lack of vis­i­bil­ity and the col­lec­tion of use­ful and rel­e­vant data on the au­to­mated pack­ag­ing line.</p>
    <p>He wanted to be able to mon­i­tor the ef­fi­ciency of the ma­chines as well as in­ves­ti­gate the root cause of stop­pages.</p>
    <p>“We also wanted to im­prove the con­nec­tiv­ity of our ma­chines, from bak­ing or fry­ing ma­chines to pack­ag­ing ma­chines. We needed to im­prove our sched­ul­ing process, which was only pos­si­ble as we col­lected more data from our ma­chines,” he said.</p>
    <p>Mr Poh added that the dig­i­tal so­lu­tion has also helped the com­pany to op­ti­mise the flow of its op­er­a­tions, which in turn has led to an in­crease in pro­duc­tiv­ity and boosted out­put by 16 per cent.</p>
    <p>“With the in­creased out­put, we were able to cope with the in­creased de­mand dur­ing the pan­demic. The in­creased pro­duc­tiv­ity also trans­lated to cost sav­ings for us,” he said.</p>
