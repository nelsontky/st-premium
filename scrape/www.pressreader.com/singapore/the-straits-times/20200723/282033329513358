    <p>Those in the pub­lic ser­vice must con­tin­u­ally chal­lenge their own per­spec­tives and learn to ap­ply so­lu­tions to var­i­ous prob­lems in the Sin­ga­pore con­text, said Trade and In­dus­try Min­is­ter Chan Chun Sing.</p>
    <p>“(We must) look at how other peo­ple do things, see what we can learn from them – as in what to do, but also some­times what not to do – so that we can ap­ply the so­lu­tions in con­text for our coun­try,” he said.</p>
    <p>Di­ver­sity is “not just based on the usual race, lan­guage, re­li­gion per­spec­tive”, but it also in­volves look­ing at dif­fer­ent ways of ap­proach­ing and solv­ing prob­lems – and th­ese are im­por­tant as­pects to con­sider in the pub­lic ser­vice, he added.</p>
    <p>Mr Chan was speak­ing to the me­dia after a vir­tual dia­logue yesterday with Pub­lic Ser­vice Com­mis­sion (PSC) schol­ar­ship re­cip­i­ents, where they dis­cussed na­tional chal­lenges such as the role of the pub­lic ser­vice in a post-Covid-19 era.</p>
    <p>There are 23 re­cip­i­ents who are pur­su­ing their stud­ies this year. Due to the pan­demic, there was no phys­i­cal award cer­e­mony.</p>
    <p>The Pub­lic Ser­vice Di­vi­sion said that hence­forth, only PSC schol­ar­ship re­cip­i­ents who are pur­su­ing their stud­ies in the cur­rent year will be in­cluded in its an­nounce­ment.</p>
    <p>Those who have de­cided to pro­ceed with their stud­ies in sub­se­quent years, such as male stu­dents do­ing their na­tional ser­vice, will be in­cluded in the rel­e­vant year’s re­ports.</p>
    <p>Mr Chan, who is also Min­is­ter-in­charge of the Pub­lic Ser­vice, said that dur­ing the dia­logue, a num­ber of schol­ar­ship re­cip­i­ents had voiced con­cerns on whether Covid-19 would dis­rupt their stud­ies and ca­reer plans.</p>
    <p>Th­ese wor­ries are valid and shared by many Sin­ga­pore­ans of their age, Mr Chan noted.</p>
    <p>PSC chair­man Lee Tzu Yang ad­dressed th­ese con­cerns in an open let­ter to the schol­ar­ship re­cip­i­ents.</p>
    <p>Mr Lee said that while travel and im­mer­sion in for­eign cul­tures have cur­rently been made dif­fi­cult by bor­der clo­sures and travel re­stric­tions, the stu­dents can di­ver­sify their learn­ing ex­pe­ri­ences in other ways.</p>
    <p>He said: “Com­mu­nity ser­vice is pos­si­ble wher­ever you are. By build­ing re­la­tion­ships with peo­ple dif­fer­ent from you, across na­tion­al­i­ties, eth­nic­i­ties and so­cio-economic back­grounds, you can bet­ter un­der­stand how oth­ers ex­pe­ri­ence and han­dle is­sues. A dif­fer­ent lens gives a dif­fer­ent view.”</p>
    <p>Mr Chan said that one im­por­tant mes­sage for the schol­ar­ship re­cip­i­ents is that, while pur­su­ing their stud­ies over­seas or lo­cally, they should “con­sciously and con­tin­u­ously look out for new op­por­tu­ni­ties to en­rich their per­spec­tives”.</p>
    <p>This is so that when cir­cum­stances change and new prob­lems arise, they will have fresh ideas on how to ap­ply so­lu­tions in the con­text of chal­lenges Sin­ga­pore­ans face.</p>
    <p>The min­is­ter added: “We are all united in one goal. And that is for Sin­ga­pore to defy the odds of his­tory to con­tinue as an in­de­pen­dent coun­try that will not only sur­vive, but thrive.</p>
    <p>“I hope that as (the schol­ar­ship re­cip­i­ents) go forth to the dif­fer­ent uni­ver­si­ties, dif­fer­ent ar­eas of stud­ies, they will also bring home new net­works and knowl­edge to en­rich Sin­ga­pore.”</p>
