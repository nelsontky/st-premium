    <p>Should you give money to your par­ents?</p>
    <p>As your par­ents get older and you get more es­tab­lished, they may turn to you for fi­nan­cial sup­port. And now may be the time older peo­ple need help.</p>
    <p>Older peo­ple have been hit from both sides by the Covid-19 pan­demic and the re­ces­sion. Re­tirees have watched their nest eggs wob­ble with the volatile stock mar­ket.</p>
    <p>Par­ents in their 70s and 80s could run out of re­tire­ment sav­ings with today’s low rates of re­turn.</p>
    <p>If your par­ents are still work­ing, they may be at greater risk of con­tract­ing Covid-19, which is much dead­lier in older peo­ple.</p>
    <p>And for the first time in 50 years, work­ers aged 55 and above are ex­pe­ri­enc­ing higher un­em­ploy­ment than mid-ca­reer work­ers.</p>
    <p>While you may feel a moral obli­ga­tion to help your par­ents fi­nan­cially, you first need to run through a ba­sic check­list.</p>
    <p>DO YOU HAVE EX­CESS CASH?</p>
    <p>First, you need to know your own fi­nan­cial sit­u­a­tion. For that, you need a per­sonal bud­get. Any de­ci­sion about your gen­eros­ity hinges on whether you have the money.</p>
    <p>Giv­ing money to your par­ents makes sense only if it af­fects your cur­rent lifestyle. It is not a good idea if it would re­duce your fu­ture lifestyle. Cut­ting your re­tire­ment con­tri­bu­tions will cost you much more than get­ting take­out less fre­quently, since a dol­lar in a re­tire­ment ac­count grows tax-free.</p>
    <p>Low­er­ing your cur­rent con­sump­tion does not harm your fi­nan­cial fu­ture. But tak­ing away from your own re­tire­ment se­cu­rity could have you ask­ing for money from your own chil­dren.</p>
    <p>BOR­ROW­ING ISN’T A GOOD AN­SWER</p>
    <p>If you bor­row to help your par­ents, you will put your­self at a fi­nan­cial dis­ad­van­tage. It will cut your credit score and give you less cush­ion for your own fu­ture money needs.</p>
    <p>Go­ing into debt or dip­ping into your own emer­gency fund car­ries sim­i­lar risks. The rule of thumb is to have six months of liv­ing ex­penses be­cause most emer­gency sur­prises are pre­dictable. With today’s low in­ter­est rates, it would be cleaner for your par­ents to bor­row the money them­selves.</p>
    <p>REA­SON FOR HELP­ING</p>
    <p>You should con­sider why your par­ents need fi­nan­cial help right now.</p>
    <p>Giv­ing money to peo­ple is eas­ier and more ef­fec­tive if the fi­nan­cial need is not caused by chronic mis­man­age­ment of funds.</p>
    <p>One-off sit­u­a­tions like es­sen­tial car re­pairs or tem­po­rary as­sis­tance after a sud­den job loss are both sen­si­ble times to give money.</p>
    <p>If your par­ents’ fi­nan­cial need is chronic, it is rea­son­able to help them find a fi­nan­cial planner and help them with a bud­get.</p>
    <p>If your par­ents have a gam­bling ad­dic­tion (up to 10 per cent of the el­derly pop­u­la­tion) or a com­pul­sive shop­ping habit (up to 5 per cent of Amer­i­can adults) then giv­ing them money is a form of co-de­pen­dency and will hurt them.</p>
    <p>Say­ing no in such cir­cum­stances should be easy. They need pro­fes­sional help, and the only ef­fec­tive help you can give is point­ing them to­wards pro­fes­sional coun­selling.</p>
    <p>If, based on the above cri­te­ria, you de­cide that giv­ing money to your par­ents is not an op­tion, you can still help them in other ways.</p>
    <p>You can give your time and care. You can give in-kind help – drop­ping off food and medicine or do­ing re­pair work. You can help them fig­ure out other sources of in­come, like food stamps.</p>
    <p>But you can­not help them if you do not have your own bud­get and man­age your own fi­nances. So, the an­swer to whether you should give your par­ents money comes full cir­cle. It de­pends on whether you have a bud­get and know what you can af­ford. If you do not bud­get your­self, then you can­not help your par­ents fi­nan­cially.</p>
