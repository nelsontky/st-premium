    <p>YUZAWA (Ja­pan) • It is noon on a warm day in the Ja­panese town where Mr Yoshi­hide Suga, Ja­pan’s next prime min­is­ter, grew up, but more than half the stores in a down­town shop­ping ar­cade are shut­tered and pave­ments stretch empty ex­cept for the rare el­derly passer-by.</p>
    <p>A build­ing pro­claim­ing “I Love Yuzawa” stands aban­doned. A gi­ant depart­ment store nearby hulks over the street, mostly un­us­able be­cause it does not meet earth­quake safety stan­dards but is too ex­pen­sive to tear down.</p>
    <p>The re­mote part of Yuzawa where Mr Suga grew up, 480km north-east of Tokyo, cap­tures key chal­lenges his ad­min­is­tra­tion will face: Half the res­i­dents in the area are over 60. De­pop­u­la­tion and age­ing have meant a dra­matic fall in tax rev­enue, push­ing the town’s gov­ern­ment, re­liant on sup­port from Tokyo, to con­sider merg­ing with other towns in Akita pre­fec­ture.</p>
    <p>“Ja­pan is the world’s fastest-age­ing na­tion, Akita the fastest-age­ing pre­fec­ture and Yuzawa one of the worst in Akita,” said town em­ployee Toru Abe, not­ing that close to 40 per cent of all Yuzawa res­i­dents are over 65, com­pared with 28 per cent for the na­tion.</p>
    <p>“If we didn’t have fis­cal sup­port from the cen­tral gov­ern­ment, we couldn’t make ends meet,” said Mr Abe. Of the town’s an­nual bud­get of 27 bil­lion yen (S$348 mil­lion), he said, only about a fifth comes from taxes.</p>
    <p>Mr Suga was cho­sen leader of</p>
    <p>Ja­pan’s rul­ing party on Mon­day and will be elected prime min­is­ter to­day, suc­ceed­ing the long-serv­ing Mr Shinzo Abe, who is re­sign­ing for health rea­sons.</p>
    <p>Yuzawa, which sees 2m snow­falls that lo­cals say make them tough, has marked Mr Suga, 71, as a self­made politi­cian among hered­i­tary law­mak­ers from wealthy fam­i­lies.</p>
    <p>It has also in­flu­enced his best­known poli­cies.</p>
    <p>These in­clude pro­mot­ing in­bound tourism, reforming the coun­try’s vast agri­cul­tural co­op­er­a­tive net­work and in­tro­duc­ing a “hometown tax” – a sys­tem allowing peo­ple to pay lo­cal taxes to an area other than where they live and, in re­turn, re­ceive de­duc­tions and lo­cal del­i­ca­cies like beef or rice.</p>
    <p>“He talked about it long be­fore then, say­ing he grew up in Akita and ben­e­fited from tax rev­enues, then moved down here and feels strange not pay­ing any­thing. He won­dered if there was a sys­tem to make it pos­si­ble,” said re­tired bu­reau­crat Hiromi Okazaki, who worked for Mr Suga in the In­ter­nal Af­fairs Min­istry when Mr Suga ran it and in­tro­duced the scheme in the 2000s.</p>
    <p>Most res­i­dents in Yuzawa blame the eco­nomic de­cline on the dev­as­tat­ing pop­u­la­tion slide, largely due to a low birth rate and lack of jobs in the town re­liant pri­mar­ily on rice farm­ing.</p>
    <p>With 16.4 deaths for ev­ery 1,000 res­i­dents last year, Akita has Ja­pan’s high­est death rate. That com­pares with 11.2 deaths na­tion</p>
    <p>wide. Its birth rate, 4.9 per 1,000, is Ja­pan’s low­est.</p>
    <p>Town of­fi­cials project 400 mil­lion yen in rev­enue from Mr Suga’s hometown tax in the fis­cal year up to the end of March. It is not enough to turn its for­tunes around, they say, but in Yuzawa, ev­ery bit helps.</p>
    <p>By a row of cig­a­rette vend­ing ma­chines in the city cen­tre hangs a sign: “To­bacco taxes are im­por­tant for our area. Let’s buy cig­a­rettes!”</p>
    <p>Last year, the tax brought in 209</p>
    <p>mil­lion yen, it says.</p>
    <p>In 2015, Akita crafted a plan to stem the de­mo­graphic de­cline with steps such as ex­pand­ing med­i­cal sub­si­dies for school­child­ren, pro­vid­ing ex­tra day­care sup­port and help­ing work­ers re­pay stu­dent loans. But lo­cal res­i­dents say it is hard to re­vive an age­ing econ­omy.</p>
    <p>“If only we had places peo­ple wanted to come, like shops,” said Ms Momoko Takahashi, 33, a Yuzawa na­tive pre­par­ing to open a cafe next month. “Even a big su­per</p>
    <p>mar­ket would help.”</p>
    <p>Mr Suga’s fam­ily home still stands in a re­mote part of Yuzawa. The place has been empty since his age­ing mother moved to a nurs­ing home three years ago.</p>
    <p>The Aki­nomiya ham­let was known for its rice fields, and adult male farm­ers left their fam­i­lies each win­ter to work in Tokyo to make ends meet – a prac­tice Mr Suga’s father Wasaburo helped elim­i­nate by ven­tur­ing into more lu­cra­tive straw­berry farm­ing and</p>
    <p>form­ing a co­op­er­a­tive.</p>
    <p>Mr Suga helped out in the straw­berry fields and was quiet and stub­born as a class­mate, prac­tis­ing base­ball for hours at night to get the third-base­man spot he wanted, said Mr Masashi Yuri, 71, who lived just a few houses away from Mr Suga.</p>
    <p>“He doesn’t show any­thing on his face, he doesn’t show his emo­tions, but in the shad­ows, he makes ex­treme ef­forts,” Mr Yuri said.</p>
