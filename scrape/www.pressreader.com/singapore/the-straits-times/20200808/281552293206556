    <p>OCBC Bank’s net profit for the three months to June 30 fell to</p>
    <p>$730 mil­lion, 40 per cent lower than the $1.2 bil­lion a year ago, af­ter it set aside “sig­nif­i­cantly higher al­lowances against ex­pected credit losses” amid a wors­en­ing econ­omy due to the coro­n­avirus pan­demic. It missed the $930 mil­lion av­er­age es­ti­mate of eight an­a­lysts sur­veyed by Bloomberg.</p>
    <p>Banks need to de­fen­sively shore up their bal­ance sheets and pre­pare for the slow re­cov­ery, given that the near-term mar­ket out­look is very un­cer­tain due to the on­go­ing pan­demic and ris­ing geopo­lit­i­cal risks, OCBC group chief ex­ec­u­tive Sa­muel Tsien said... The bank’s pro­vi­sions for credit losses surged to $750 mil­lion in the sec­ond quar­ter from $111 mil­lion a year ago.</p>
    <p>Loans is­sued by OCBC Bank that are un­der mora­to­rium amount to $27 bil­lion, slightly less than 10 per cent of its loan book, group chief ex­ec­u­tive Sa­muel Tsien said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Eighty-eight per cent of such loans in its op­er­at­ing mar­kets, such as Sin­ga­pore, Malaysia and Hong Kong, are fully se­cured, he added.</p>
    <p>Mr Tsien was ad­dress­ing con­cerns about the un­cer­tainty faced by banks in the re­gion be­cause of the Covid-19 sit­u­a­tion, es­pe­cially af­ter re­lief mea­sures rolled out by gov­ern­ments start to wind down over the next few months.</p>
    <p>For Sin­ga­pore, 6.8 per cent of the bank’s loans are on mora­to­rium, with 96 per cent fully se­cured.</p>
    <p>Gov­ern­ments in the re­gion rolled out re­lief mea­sures ear­lier this year, in­clud­ing loan mora­to­ri­ums, to help busi­nesses cope with the eco­nomic fall­out due to the out­break.</p>
    <p>The Mon­e­tary Au­thor­ity of Sin­ga­pore ear­lier said it is work­ing with banks to pre­pare a soft land­ing for firms that have taken up its sup­port schemes, as re­lief mea­sures will be rolled back by the end of this year.</p>
    <p>Speak­ing at OCBC’s re­lease of its sec­ond-quar­ter re­sults, Mr Tsien said South-east Asia’s sec­ond-big­gest lender is “man­ag­ing the exit from the re­lief pro­gramme as much as we can, and we are work­ing with reg­u­la­tors all around the world, in­clud­ing Sin­ga­pore, Malaysia, In­done­sia and Hong Kong”.</p>
    <p>OCBC’s net profit for the three months to June 30 fell to $730 mil­lion, 40 per cent lower than the $1.2 bil­lion a year ago, af­ter it set aside “sig­nif­i­cantly higher al­lowances against ex­pected credit losses” amid a wors­en­ing econ­omy due to the coro­n­avirus pan­demic.</p>
    <p>It missed the $930 mil­lion av­er­age es­ti­mate of eight an­a­lysts sur­veyed by Bloomberg.</p>
    <p>This brings the bank’s net profit for the first six months this year to $1.4 bil­lion, 42 per cent lower than the $2.5 bil­lion a year ago.</p>
    <p>Banks need to de­fen­sively shore up their bal­ance sheets and pre­pare for the slow re­cov­ery, given that the near-term mar­ket out­look is very un­cer­tain due to the on­go­ing pan­demic and ris­ing geopo­lit­i­cal risks, Mr Tsien said. “This is ex­actly what we have done since the start of the pan­demic cri­sis,” he added.</p>
    <p>The bank’s pro­vi­sions for credit losses surged to $750 mil­lion in the sec­ond quar­ter from $111 mil­lion a year ago.</p>
    <p>OCBC said in a state­ment yes­ter­day that its earn­ings since March have been hit by busi­ness dis­rup­tions and a slow­down in cus­tomer ac­tiv­i­ties as coun­tries took mea­sures lim­it­ing move­ments and in­ter­ac­tions to curb virus trans­mis­sions.</p>
    <p>Mr Tsien said: “De­spite the un­prece­dented size of gov­ern­ment and cen­tral bank re­lief pro­grammes ex­tended across the world, busi­ness and con­sumer sen­ti­ments con­tin­ued to be weak.</p>
    <p>“The emer­gence of economies to­wards the road to re­cov­ery will be slow and chal­leng­ing. We will con­tinue to con­tain all dis­cre­tionary ex­pen­di­ture, in­clud­ing man­age­ment com­pen­sa­tion.”</p>
    <p>The bank’s net in­ter­est mar­gin – a key gauge for prof­itabil­ity – fell to 1.68 for the first six months this year, from 1.78 a year ago.</p>
    <p>Mr Tsien ex­pects net in­ter­est mar­gin to dip fur­ther but re­main in the higher end of the 1.5 range in the sec­ond half of the year.</p>
    <p>The board de­clared a div­i­dend of 15.9 cents a share for the first half, with the scrip div­i­dend scheme ap­pli­ca­ble. Share­hold­ers can opt to re­ceive the div­i­dend in the form of shares, with the is­sue price of the shares set at a 10 per cent dis­count.</p>
    <p>The move is in line with cen­tral bank guid­ance for lo­cal banks to mod­er­ate this year’s div­i­dends. OCBC paid a div­i­dend of 25 cents a share for the same pe­riod last year.</p>
    <p>OCBC shares ended at $8.72 yes­ter­day, down 8 cents or 0.91 per cent.</p>
