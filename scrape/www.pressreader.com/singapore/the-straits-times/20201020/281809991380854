    <p>NEW DELHI • The In­dian army yes­ter­day said it had cap­tured a Chi­nese sol­dier af­ter he strayed across a con­tested border in the western Hi­malayan re­gion where both coun­tries have amassed thou­sands of troops af­ter a deadly clash in June.</p>
    <p>The People’s Lib­er­a­tion Army (PLA) sol­dier was ap­pre­hended in the Dem­chok area of eastern Ladakh, and would be re­turned af­ter the com­ple­tion of for­mal­i­ties, the In­dian army said.</p>
    <p>“The PLA sol­dier has been pro­vided med­i­cal as­sis­tance in­clud­ing oxy­gen, food and warm clothes to pro­tect him from the va­garies of ex­treme al­ti­tude and harsh cli­matic con­di­tions.”</p>
    <p>The nu­clear-armed neigh­bours have been locked in a months-long border con­fronta­tion in the Ladakh re­gion, with troops killing one another in hand-to-hand com­bat and fir­ing shots in the air.</p>
    <p>Both sides have held sev­eral rounds of mil­i­tary and diplo­matic talks, but have made lit­tle head­way.</p>
    <p>There was no im­me­di­ate com­ment from China on the cap­ture of its sol­dier, but the edi­tor-in-chief of state-backed Global Times tweeted that the mat­ter was be­ing re­solved.</p>
    <p>“Based on what I know, one Chi­nese sol­dier was de­tained by In­dian side, very likely be­cause of get­ting lost,” Mr Hu Xi­jin wrote.</p>
    <p>“In­dian side has a pos­i­tive at­ti­tude. The sol­dier will be re­turned to China. The is­sue should not cause new ten­sions in the border area.”</p>
    <p>As the ten­sions in Ladakh con­tinue with no sign of dis­so­lu­tion,</p>
    <p>In­dia has bought high-al­ti­tude war­fare kits from the United States on an ur­gent ba­sis, re­ports say, cit­ing of­fi­cials with knowl­edge of the mat­ter.</p>
    <p>The In­dian army used an agree­ment that al­lows the two mil­i­taries to pro­vide lo­gis­ti­cal as­sis­tance to each other, such as buy­ing fuel and spare parts for equip­ment, for the trans­ac­tion, said the of­fi­cials who asked not to be iden­ti­fied.</p>
    <p>The move may prove sig­nif­i­cant as the area is known for its bonechilli­ng tem­per­a­tures, and war in such en­vi­ron­ments is of­ten fraught with dan­ger. With win­ter ap­proach­ing, the troops in Ladakh face fight­ing at 4,572m, with tem­per­a­tures drop­ping to -30 deg C.</p>
    <p>New Delhi, in a sharp as­ser­tion last Thurs­day, said China has no right to com­ment on its in­ter­nal mat­ters, af­ter Beijing’s re­marks fol­low­ing In­dia’s re­cent open­ing of 44 bridges in border ar­eas.</p>
    <p>“The Union Ter­ri­to­ries of Ladakh, Jammu and Kash­mir have been, are and will re­main an in­te­gral part of In­dia,” In­dian for­eign min­istry spokesman Anurag Sri­vas­tava said.</p>
    <p>“Our po­si­tion on Arunachal Pradesh has also been made clear sev­eral times. Arunachal Pradesh is an in­te­gral and in­alien­able part of In­dia. This fact has also been clearly con­veyed to the Chi­nese side on sev­eral oc­ca­sions, in­clud­ing at the high­est level.”</p>
    <p>China had ear­lier said it “does not recog­nise the Ladakh Union Ter­ri­tory” and op­poses in­fra­struc­ture build­ing by In­dia in the re­gion.</p>
    <p>Chi­nese for­eign min­istry spokesman Zhao Li­jian had also called border in­fra­struc­ture de­vel­op­ment “the root cause of the ten­sion be­tween the two sides” and said nei­ther side should take ac­tion that might es­ca­late ten­sion.</p>
