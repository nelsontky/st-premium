    <p>A pho­to­graph of an el­derly man sur­rounded by empty shelves in a su­per­mar­ket was the cat­a­lyst for five stu­dents to cre­ate the Can Mah! plat­form, which pairs se­niors who need help get­ting gro­ceries with neigh­bours who can lend a hand.</p>
    <p>Atishay Dik­shit, 18, who is among the group that re­cently grad­u­ated from the United World Col­lege of South East Asia (UWC), says he and his friends wanted to do some­thing mean­ing­ful dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker.</p>
    <p>He says their goal was to help the el­derly get gro­ceries with­out hav­ing to com­pete for slots on de­liv­ery plat­forms or risk ex­po­sure to the coro­n­avirus at su­per­mar­kets.</p>
    <p>They ini­tially wanted to cre­ate a new plat­form, but de­cided to in­te­grate it with GoodHood.SG, a free shar­ing plat­form, to tap its ex­ist­ing user base. GoodHood al­lows peo­ple to put up items for sale or do­na­tion, list ways they can help or re­spond to spe­cific re­quests from those liv­ing nearby.</p>
    <p>Atishay and his friends coded the Can Mah! plat­form, spend­ing up to nine hours a day on chat app Dis­cord as they worked out the pro­gram­ming, de­sign and in­ter­face. They launched it early last month.</p>
    <p>“UWC has al­ways taught us the im­por­tance of giv­ing back. The Sin­ga­pore com­mu­nity has been so good to us all these years and we just wanted to con­trib­ute to the kam­pung spirit we en­joyed,” says Atishay, a per­ma­nent res­i­dent who moved here from New Delhi with his fam­ily 11 years ago.</p>
    <p>Two of the co-founders are Sin­ga­pore cit­i­zens and two are stu­dent pass hold­ers.</p>
    <p>Since the launch, the team has re­ceived a $5,000 grant from the Os­car@SG fund, launched by Te­masek Trust, the phil­an­thropic arm of Sin­ga­pore in­vest­ment firm Te­masek. They will use it to spon­sor gro­ceries for vul­ner­a­ble in­di­vid­u­als.</p>
    <p>Be­yond the cur­rent pan­demic, Atishay hopes Can Mah! will con­tinue to serve the needs of those vul­ner­a­ble.</p>
    <p>“Even when Sin­ga­pore goes back to what it was be­fore the pan­demic, the plat­form could still con­nect the youth and el­derly in the com­mu­nity,” he says.</p>
