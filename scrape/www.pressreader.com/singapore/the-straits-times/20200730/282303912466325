    <p>Job seek­ers in Sin­ga­pore are see­ing signed em­ploy­ment con­tracts re­scinded as busi­nesses cut back on hir­ing dur­ing the coron­avirus pan­demic-trig­gered re­ces­sion, re­cruiters say.</p>
    <p>There was a spike in cases of com­pa­nies can­celling job of­fers in late March and early April, said Mr Rob Bryson, man­ag­ing di­rec­tor of re­cruit­ment agency Robert Wal­ters Sin­ga­pore. Un­like the global fi­nan­cial cri­sis, when most jobs af­fected by the down­turn were in bank­ing, in­dus­tries now tak­ing a knock in­clude re­tail and aero­space, ac­cord­ing to Mr Ni­lay Khan­del­wal, man­ag­ing di­rec­tor at Michael Page Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>There are no hard fig­ures to show how wide­spread the prac­tice is, but the com­ments re­flect un­cer­tainty about busi­ness prospects as the city-state en­dures its worst re­ces­sion on record.</p>
    <p>A gov­ern­ment re­port yes­ter­day showed the job­less rate rose to 2.9 per cent in the se­cond quar­ter, the high­est since the global fi­nan­cial cri­sis. Mr Euben Paraceulle­s, an econ­o­mist at No­mura Hold­ings, es­ti­mates the rate could reach 4.5 per cent in the se­cond half of this year.</p>
    <p>Mr Paul Hoon said he re­signed from his job in early June af­ter sign­ing a con­tract to be a re­gional sup­plier qual­ity man­ager with a US­based firm that de­signs and builds com­mer­cial fans. The day be­fore he was due to start, the firm told him it had “ceased” the con­tract be­cause of the eco­nomic blow from Covid-19.</p>
    <p>Mr Der­rick Lim also lost out on a new job. The Sin­ga­porean said he was of­fered a job as a cus­tomer ex­pe­ri­ence man­ager at a car deal­er­ship at the end of Fe­bru­ary, but the hu­man re­sources gen­eral man­ager later ad­vised him to re­join his pre­vi­ous firm. It took 14 job in­ter­views be­fore he found a new po­si­tion, he said.</p>
    <p>Mr Khan­del­wal said busi­nesses are can­celling jobs in re­gional sales and tal­ent ac­qui­si­tion, although “bright spots” still re­main in tech­nol­ogy, es­pe­cially de­vel­oper roles.</p>
    <p>Mr Bryson said there has been a gen­eral down­turn in hir­ing and a slow­down in the process. Busi­nesses “will only start the hir­ing process if they have a clear in­ter­nal man­date to do so, rather than mak­ing spec­u­la­tive hires”, he said.</p>
