    <p>Most of us are used to driv­ing in the rain, thanks to our fre­quent show­ers through­out the year. How­ever, we do still have sea­sons when it rains for days at a stretch, some­times with vis­i­bil­ity-im­pair­ing tor­ren­tial down­pours. That sea­son is upon us now.</p>
    <p>To stay safe, you must first en­sure all your car’s tyres are in good con­di­tion. If they look worn, they prob­a­bly are. Change them.</p>
    <p>Check that the tyre pres­sures are as rec­om­mended. Grip de­te­ri­o­rates when tyres are ei­ther un­der- or over-in­flated.</p>
    <p>Be warned, how­ever, that even a ve­hi­cle with per­fectly good tyres can aqua­plane over a pool of stand­ing wa­ter at cer­tain speeds. When this hap­pens, you lose brak­ing and steer­ing con­trol.</p>
    <p>Stay clear of pud­dles as far as pos­si­ble, or slow down and brace your­self for a wig­gle if you can­not avoid one. Of­ten, driv­ers caught un­awares panic and make the sit­u­a­tion worse.</p>
    <p>Take the mid­dle lane, as pud­dles are un­likely to form there. Keep in mind a ve­hi­cle can lose con­trol mo­men­tar­ily even if one side of it hits a pud­dle. Keep a longer dis­tance from the ve­hi­cle in front.</p>
    <p>One com­monly for­got­ten el­e­ment on a car is the wipers, which de­te­ri­o­rate quickly in our cli­mate. Wipers are in­ex­pen­sive, so change them reg­u­larly. Also re­mem­ber to top up the windshield washer reser­voir, prefer­ably with glass-clean­ing ad­di­tives.</p>
    <p>Fi­nally, drive with the head­lights on in heavy rain to im­prove vis­i­bil­ity all round.</p>
