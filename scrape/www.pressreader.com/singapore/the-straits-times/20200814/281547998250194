    <p>Tai­wan yesterday un­veiled an in­crease of nearly $2 bil­lion for next year’s planned defence spend­ing, as China an­nounced de­tails of its lat­est com­bat drills near the self-ruled is­land it claims as its own. On Mon­day, Tai­wan said Chi­nese fight­ers briefly crossed the sen­si­tive me­dian line of the Tai­wan Strait, the same day United States health chief Alex Azar met Tai­wan Pres­i­dent Tsai Ing-wen in Taipei.</p>
    <p>TAIPEI • Tai­wan yesterday un­veiled an in­crease of NT$42.1 bil­lion (S$1.98 bil­lion) for next year’s planned defence spend­ing, as China an­nounced de­tails of its lat­est com­bat drills near the sel­f­ruled is­land it claims as its own.</p>
    <p>China has stepped up its mil­i­tary ac­tiv­ity near Tai­wan, which it re­gards as a break­away prov­ince.</p>
    <p>On Mon­day, Tai­wan said Chi­nese fight­ers briefly crossed the sen­si­tive me­dian line of the Tai­wan Strait, the same day US health chief Alex Azar met Tai­wan Pres­i­dent Tsai Ing-wen in Taipei. China has de­nounced Mr Azar’s trip.</p>
    <p>Ms Tsai’s Cabi­net is propos­ing NT$453.4 bil­lion in mil­i­tary spend­ing for the year start­ing in Jan­uary, ver­sus the NT$411.3 bil­lion bud­geted for this year, up 10.2 per cent.</p>
    <p>“The steady in­crease in the defence bud­get will fa­cil­i­tate the im­ple­men­ta­tion of var­i­ous mil­i­tary­build­ing and war-prepa­ra­tion tasks... and en­sure na­tional se­cu­rity and re­gional peace and sta­bil­ity,” the Defence Min­istry said.</p>
    <p>About three hours after the bud­get an­nounce­ment, China’s Peo­ple’s Lib­er­a­tion Army’s Eastern Theatre Com­mand said its forces had in re­cent days car­ried out com­bat drills in the Tai­wan Strait and to the north and south of the is­land, im­ply­ing they were aimed at Mr Azar’s visit this week.</p>
    <p>“Re­cently, a cer­tain large coun­try has con­tin­ued to make neg­a­tive moves on Tai­wan-re­lated is­sues, send­ing se­ri­ous wrong sig­nals to ‘Tai­wan in­de­pen­dence’ forces, and se­ri­ously threat­en­ing the peace and sta­bil­ity of the Tai­wan Strait,” it said in a state­ment.</p>
    <p>“The theatre com­mand’s or­gan­is­ing of pa­trols and ex­er­cises are nec­es­sary ac­tions taken in re­sponse to the cur­rent se­cu­rity sit­u­a­tion across the Tai­wan Strait and to safe­guard na­tional sovereignt­y.”</p>
    <p>Tai­wan’s Defence Min­istry said the sit­u­a­tion was nor­mal and that peo­ple should not worry.</p>
    <p>Ms Tsai has made mod­ernising Tai­wan’s armed forces and in­creas­ing defence spend­ing a pri­or­ity as her gov­ern­ment seeks to off­set China’s in­creas­ing mil­i­tary ad­van­tage over the demo­cratic is­land.</p>
    <p>The bud­get must be ap­proved by law­mak­ers and is un­likely to be blocked as Ms Tsai’s Demo­cratic Pro­gres­sive Party has a large ma­jor­ity in the leg­is­la­ture.</p>
    <p>In an on­line event hosted by the Washington-based Hud­son In­sti­tute on Wed­nes­day, Ms Tsai called on the in­ter­na­tional com­mu­nity to speak out against Bei­jing.</p>
    <p>“Our 23 mil­lion peo­ple have the right to de­ter­mine our own fu­tures, which is the an­tithe­sis of the ap­proach Bei­jing has taken,” Ms Tsai said dur­ing the con­fer­ence.</p>
    <p>She also praised the United States and Bri­tain for crit­i­cis­ing China’s ac­tions i n the f ormer Bri­tish colony of Hong Kong, while call­ing on more nations to do so.</p>
    <p>China has never re­nounced the use of force to bring Tai­wan un­der its con­trol, and has de­nounced the US for arms sales to the is­land.</p>
    <p>Washington is bound by law to pro­vide Tai­wan with the means to de­fend it­self.</p>
    <p>Tai­wan is in dis­cus­sions with the US to ac­quire sea mines to de­ter am­phibi­ous land­ings, as well as cruise mis­siles for coastal defence, Tai­wan’s de facto am­bas­sador to the US said on Wed­nes­day.</p>
    <p>Last year, the US State Depart­ment ap­proved arms sales worth US$10 bil­lion (S$13.7 bil­lion) for Tai­wan.</p>
    <p>Tai­wan’s mil­i­tary is well armed, but dwarfed by China’s.</p>
    <p>“Tai­wan au­thor­i­ties are spend­ing their tax­pay­ers’ money on defence, but no mat­ter how much they spend on defence, Tai­wan is still a small place. Con­fronting the main­land is like an ant try­ing to shake a tree,” Chi­nese For­eign Min­istry spokesman Zhao Li­jian said.</p>
