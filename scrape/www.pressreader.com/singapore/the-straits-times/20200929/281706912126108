    <p>Here are ex­tracts of ed­i­to­ri­als from sev­eral news­pa­pers yes­ter­day to mark World News Day:</p>
    <p>Hold the front page (The Ir­ish Times):</p>
    <p>“In mark­ing World News Day to­day, news or­gan­i­sa­tions across the globe are set­ting out the case that ‘news’ mat­ters, that news is more than en­ter­tain­ment or ad­ver­tis­ing – though it can be all – and that news is an es­sen­tial oxy­gen sup­ply em­pow­er­ing cit­i­zens, hold­ing au­thor­ity to ac­count. And in do­ing so, sus­tain­ing demo­cratic so­ci­eties, a vi­tal coun­ter­weight to po­lit­i­cal and eco­nomic power...</p>
    <p>The oc­ca­sion, how­ever, is not just an ac­knowl­edg­ment of jour­nal­ism and its ne­ces­sity, a mu­tual self-con­grat­u­la­tory pat on the back, but a warn­ing that all is far from well, that news and jour­nal­ism are crit­i­cally threat­ened.”</p>
    <p>Qual­ity jour­nal­ism more cru­cial than ever</p>
    <p>(The Her­ald, South Africa):</p>
    <p>“With so much mis­in­for­ma­tion cir­cu­lat­ing on so­cial me­dia these days, cred­i­ble jour­nal­ism is cru­cial...</p>
    <p>In a world feast­ing on ‘fast news’, it is up to pro­fes­sional me­dia or­gan­i­sa­tions and jour­nal­ists to en­sure that the tra­di­tional forms of gath­er­ing the news, to­gether with the re­quired checks and bal­ances, don’t fall by the way­side in the rush to be ‘first’ with the story.</p>
    <p>In the age of Twit­ter, Face­book and Google, among oth­ers, there is a very clear place for cred­i­ble, trusted me­dia or­gan­i­sa­tions.”</p>
    <p>In an age of fake news, press free­dom must be pro­moted and pro­tected (South China Morn­ing Post):</p>
    <p>“There is a thirst for ac­cu­rate in­for­ma­tion about this deadly new disease and the mea­sures taken to curb it. But read­ers are con­fronted with a mass of un­re­li­able in­for­ma­tion and ru­mours, most of it through so­cial me­dia. Jour­nal­ists are trained to re­port ob­jec­tively and fairly. They sub­stan­ti­ate facts and pro­vide bal­ance. They do not al­ways get it right. But there are good rea­sons why read­ers have turned to pro­fes­sional me­dia or­gan­i­sa­tions dur­ing the pan­demic as they seek re­li­able in­for­ma­tion.”</p>
    <p>Vi­tal, vig­i­lant jour­nal­ism (Philip­pine Daily In­quirer):</p>
    <p>“The weapon­i­sa­tion of so­cial me­dia for the ben­e­fit of pow­er­ful po­lit­i­cal in­ter­ests is why jour­nal­ism has be­come even more vi­tal and rel­e­vant to­day.</p>
    <p>In an age where all sorts of in­for­ma­tion are at peo­ple’s fin­ger­tips, the work of jour­nal­ists has be­come way more daunt­ing but es­sen­tial, a con­stant fight to shine the light of truth against those who have the mo­tive and the means to sup­press it.”</p>
