    <p>A housewife who had Covid-19 last Fe­bru­ary, and was part of the Safra Jurong clus­ter which ac­counted for 47 cases, has been sen­tenced to five months’ jail for de­lib­er­ately not pro­vid­ing in­for­ma­tion for con­tact trac­ing pur­poses.</p>
    <p>Oh Bee Hiok, who was di­ag­nosed on Feb 26 last year, did not tell Min­istry of Health (MOH) of­fi­cers that she had met a close male friend mul­ti­ple times ear­lier that month.</p>
    <p>The 65-year-old feared oth­ers might think that she was hav­ing an af­fair with the man, Mr Lim Kiang Hong. Mr Lim, 71, was him­self di­ag­nosed with Covid-19 on March 20 last year.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, the court heard that Oh’s of­fences came to light only when in­ves­ti­ga­tors un­cov­ered in­for­ma­tion in­clud­ing park­ing records for cars driven by her and Mr Lim, CCTV footage, Mr Lim’s credit card records and call logs. MOH of­fi­cers who in­ter­viewed him later dis­cov­ered that he had met her mul­ti­ple times be­tween Feb 4 and Feb 20 last year.</p>
    <p>In plead­ing for his client to be given a “stiff fine” in­stead of a jail term, de­fence lawyer Goh Teck</p>
    <p>Wee told District Judge Marvin Bay that Oh did not in­fect Mr Lim.</p>
    <p>She did, how­ever, in­fect her own grand­son.</p>
    <p>Oh had vis­ited Safra Jurong on Feb 15. A Chi­nese New Year cel­e­bra­tion held in the ball­room of Joy Gar­den restau­rant that same day led to 47 cases in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>On Feb 24, she was ad­mit­ted to Sin­ga­pore Gen­eral Hos­pi­tal af­ter de­vel­op­ing a fever, and was di­ag­nosed with Covid-19 two days later.</p>
    <p>Dr Yang Yong, an epi­demi­ol­o­gist, spoke to Oh that same day to con­duct con­tact trac­ing and es­tab­lish her ac­tiv­i­ties ear­lier that month. She said she went gro­cery shop­ping at wet mar­kets in Bukit Ba­tok and Bukit Timah three times a week. She also told the doc­tor she had cel­e­brated her hus­band’s birthday with her fam­ily on Feb 22.</p>
    <p>But she did not pro­vide de­tails about the cel­e­bra­tion, said Deputy Public Prose­cu­tor Jane Lim. Court doc­u­ments did not state the lo­ca­tion of the birthday cel­e­bra­tion.</p>
    <p>Oh was con­tacted again on sep­a­rate oc­ca­sions later in Fe­bru­ary and March by two dif­fer­ent MOH of­fi­cers who wanted to know more about her ac­tiv­i­ties the pre­vi­ous month.</p>
    <p>She said she had vis­ited Safra Jurong on Feb 15 but again did not dis­close her meet­ings with Mr Lim.</p>
    <p>It was only af­ter the park­ing records were made known that she came clean. On March 8 last year, she ad­mit­ted to an MOH in­ves­ti­ga­tor she had met Mr Lim.</p>
    <p>Oh, whose bail was set at $15,000, in­tends to ap­peal against her sen­tence.</p>
