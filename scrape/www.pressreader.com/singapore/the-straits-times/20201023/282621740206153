    <p>Just when bars in Sin­ga­pore are putting out more elab­o­rate food menus to keep afloat, Porkyp­ine in Telok Ayer Street is forg­ing ahead with a pared down menu. There is just one thing on it: the Cubano sand­wich ($18, right).</p>
    <p>The tiny bar at the back of a curry restau­rant – there are barely six seats – opened last month. The two guys be­hind it are Mr Kh­ley Dhillon and Mr Ab­hishek C. Ge­orge, both 35, known quan­ti­ties in the bar scene here.</p>
    <p>There is some­thing rough and un­pol­ished about the look of the place. It feels like some­one’s recre­ation room and re­minds me of the early days of The Spiffy Dap­per, which Mr Ge­orge started.</p>
    <p>But there is noth­ing rough and un­pol­ished about the cock­tails</p>
    <p>(all $18 each). Here, you can have a daiquiri and a Hem­ing­way Daiquiri and see which you pre­fer. I like the Mez­cal Ne­groni and the Mai Tai is many lev­els up from the cliche it some­times is.</p>
    <p>Ah, but my friends rave about the Cubano and that is what I am there for. It does not dis­ap­point. Mr Ge­orge was in­spired by the 2014 movie Chef, in which Jon Favreau plays a chef who quits his job in a fine-din­ing restau­rant to sell Cubano sand­wiches from a food truck, and re­con­nects with his son.</p>
    <p>It is made with care. You can see the process from your bar-counter seat. The Cuban rolls, made for the bar, are stuffed with ham smoked in-house, roast pork slow cooked for 24 hours, house­made pick­led Le­banese cu­cum­bers, mojo sauce, lard may­on­naise and Em­men­tal cheese. Then, the whole thing goes into a huge sand­wich press and emerges crisp and singed beau­ti­fully in the cor­ners, the cheese melt­ing.</p>
    <p>I could jaw on and on about how good it is. But noth­ing beats rolling up to the bar and say­ing: “I’ll have a Hem­ing­way Daiquiri and one of those Cubanos, please.”</p>
    <p>And more ba­nana chips with ex­tra salsa pi­cante and mojo salsa too. WHERE: Porkyp­ine, 112 Telok Ayer Street MRT: Telok Ayer</p>
    <p>TEL: 8874-2606 OPEN: 11am to 3pm, 5pm till late (Tues­days to Satur­days) INFO: www.face­book.com/ porkyp­ine.sg</p>
