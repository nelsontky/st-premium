    <p>•</p>
    <p>One of Thai­land’s most high-pro­file crit­ics said the gov­ern­ment was fac­ing a “per­fect storm” of protests and eco­nomic dis­tress caused by the coro­n­avirus pan­demic, pre­dict­ing it would not last the full term af­ter los­ing the trust of its peo­ple.</p>
    <p>Mr Thanathorn Juan­groon­gru­angkit, the for­mer leader of the op­po­si­tion Fu­ture For­ward Party, was banned from pol­i­tics for 10 years af­ter a court or­dered the group’s dis­so­lu­tion for breach­ing fi­nanc­ing rules in Fe­bru­ary. He has re­peat­edly de­nied the charges.</p>
    <p>“In time of po­lit­i­cal, eco­nomic and health crises, if you can’t com­mand trust of the peo­ple, how can you run the coun­try?” Mr Thanathorn said in an in­ter­view in Bangkok on Mon­day. “You can’t even find a fi­nance min­is­ter. It means no one has con­fi­dence in you.”</p>
    <p>The pre­vi­ous min­is­ter quit due to health rea­sons early last month, af­ter less than a month into the job, and has yet to be re­placed.</p>
    <p>The break-up of Mr Thanathorn’s party, which won the third-largest share of seats in last year’s elec­tion, started a wave of anti-gov­ern­ment protests that have ex­panded in re­cent months, with 50,000 peo­ple at­tend­ing the big­gest rally last month.</p>
    <p>Pro­test­ers are de­mand­ing changes that in­clude scrap­ping the mil­i­tary-ap­pointed Se­nate – which played a key role in the re­turn of coup leader Prayut Chan-o-cha as prime min­is­ter af­ter the elec­tion last year – and rein­ing in the power of King Maha Va­ji­ra­longkorn.</p>
    <p>The ad­min­is­tra­tion should not “un­der­es­ti­mate the anger of the peo­ple”, said Mr Thanathorn, who is now run­ning the Pro­gres­sive Move­ment, a group of for­mer Fu­ture For­ward ex­ec­u­tives sup­port­ing can­di­dates run­ning in lo­cal elec­tions, which are ex­pected to be held in De­cem­ber. “I don’t think Prayut’s gov­ern­ment will last full term. His gov­ern­ment has lost all the trust of the peo­ple.”</p>
    <p>Gov­ern­ment spokesman Anucha Bu­ra­pachaisri said that un­der Mr Prayut’s lead­er­ship, the coun­try’s re­sponse to the pan­demic had earned the praise of the World Health Or­gan­i­sa­tion.</p>
    <p>“The gov­ern­ment will roll out var­i­ous eco­nomic mea­sures to re­store con­fi­dence, and boost in­vest­ment and con­sump­tion,” Mr Anucha said. “It’s also pre­par­ing to al­low for­eign vis­i­tors to travel to Thai­land with strict con­trol mea­sures.”</p>
    <p>On Tues­day, the Cabi­net ap­proved 51 bil­lion baht (S$2.2 bil­lion) worth of eco­nomic stim­u­lus mea­sures to bol­ster con­sump­tion, which the Fi­nance Min­istry said should help min­imise the hit to the econ­omy.</p>
    <p>It also cleared 1.47 tril­lion baht in gov­ern­ment bor­row­ing in the fis­cal year start­ing to­day to fund fis­cal stim­u­lus and the bud­get deficit.</p>
    <p>The es­ca­lat­ing protests add to the chal­lenges fac­ing Mr Prayut’s gov­ern­ment, which is try­ing to re­vive an econ­omy on track for a record con­trac­tion this year af­ter the pan­demic dis­rupted in­ter­na­tional trade and travel, the coun­try’s two most im­por­tant sec­tors.</p>
    <p>Mr Prayut said early this week that he ex­pected to an­nounce the new fi­nance min­is­ter next week,</p>
    <p>not­ing he needed time to find “the best per­son” who is ready and whose fam­ily is ready. He pre­vi­ously said the res­ig­na­tion of the min­is­ter would not de­rail gov­ern­ment poli­cies. Mr Prayut again ap­pealed to pro­test­ers “to re­duce pressure” and avoid creat­ing more con­flict and di­vi­sion in the coun­try.</p>
    <p>Demon­stra­tors want the Con­sti­tu­tion rewrit­ten. It was de­vel­oped un­der the lead­er­ship of Mr Prayut’s junta and is widely seen as one of the tools that helped his mil­i­tary­backed regime main­tain its power in last year’s vote.</p>
    <p>Mr Thanathorn, who has been at sev­eral demon­stra­tions over the past months, said the coun­try was weath­er­ing an un­prece­dented se­ries of chal­lenges. “It’s ba­si­cally a per­fect storm.”</p>
