    <p>A se­rial mo­lester who has been in and out of jail since 2003 re­of­fended a month after he was re­leased last year. He was caught and while out on bail, he mo­lested two 13-year-old girls.</p>
    <p>Vaz Clive Hi­lary Cheng Kiat was re­leased from prison on Jan 19 last year be­fore he out­raged the mod­esty of a 31-year-old woman the fol­low­ing month. The court heard that he also mo­lested a 24-year-old woman on March 9 last year.</p>
    <p>He was ar­rested three days later and granted bail.</p>
    <p>But Cheng could not keep out of trou­ble as he went on to mo­lest the two teenage girls in sep­a­rate in­ci­dents on buses.</p>
    <p>The 41-year-old Sin­ga­porean pleaded guilty yes­ter­day to two mo­lesta­tion charges in­volv­ing the teenagers. Two other charges for sim­i­lar of­fences linked to t he women will be con­sid­ered dur­ing sen­tenc­ing.</p>
    <p>On May 25 last year, one of the teenage girls boarded bus ser­vice 190 with her younger sis­ter and their par­ents near Clarke Quay Cen­tral shop­ping mall at around 8pm.</p>
    <p>They went to the up­per deck of the bus where the girl sat be­side her sis­ter while their par­ents took the seats in front of them.</p>
    <p>Cheng boarded the bus about 20 min­utes later and sat be­hind the two girls al­though there were many empty seats on the up­per deck. He mo­lested the 13-year-old girl through a gap be­tween the seat and a win­dow.</p>
    <p>Even though her par­ents were nearby, the teenager kept silent as she was afraid and did not know how to re­act.</p>
    <p>She told her mother about what had hap­pened after they alighted near Ion Orchard shop­ping mall later that evening.</p>
    <p>Cheng struck again on Aug 3 this year and tar­geted an­other 13-yearold girl who was on her way home from school.</p>
    <p>They were on the up­per deck of bus ser­vice 43 at around 2.45pm that day when he mo­lested her. The girl yelled at Cheng, who im­me­di­ately raised both palms and apol­o­gised be­fore get­ting up.</p>
    <p>She asked an­other man seated nearby for help, but he re­fused and told her to in­form the bus driver in­stead.</p>
    <p>After the girl told the driver, Cheng de­nied mo­lest­ing her when con­fronted.</p>
    <p>The driver pulled up at a bus stop near Asi­aw­ide In­dus­trial Build­ing in Pereira Road, off Up­per Paya Le­bar Road, closed the doors of the bus and told Cheng to take a seat. When a pas­sen­ger wanted to alight, the driver opened the doors.</p>
    <p>Cheng then took the op­por­tu­nity to run out and the pas­sen­ger chased after him.</p>
    <p>He grabbed Cheng’s bag dur­ing the pursuit and the of­fender was caught soon after.</p>
    <p>Cheng will be sen­tenced on Sept 18.</p>
