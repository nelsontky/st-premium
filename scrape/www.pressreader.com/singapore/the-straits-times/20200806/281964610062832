    <p>The Greek his­to­rian Thucy­dides wrote his fa­mous His­tory Of The Pelo­pon­nesian War to ex­plain the causes of the fierce con­flict be­tween his na­tive Athens and its ri­val Sparta that en­gulfed the Hel­lenic world (431-404BC). This re­mains one clas­si­cal text that has enor­mously in­flu­enced the­o­rists of in­ter­na­tional re­la­tions ever since.</p>
    <p>His Melian Dia­logue, in par­tic­u­lar, has spe­cial res­o­nance in our times as the dis­course be­tween the en­voys of Athens and the peo­ple of the tiny is­land of Me­los, who wanted to re­main neu­tral in the war, con­tin­ues to res­onate in the cur­rent po­lit­i­cal ten­sions in Asia.</p>
    <p>The en­voys of Athens, the ris­ing power, had a blunt mes­sage for Me­los – neu­tral­ity was un­ac­cept­able and it should sur­ren­der to Athens to avoid de­struc­tion. The Melians re­fused, ar­gu­ing that the gods would sup­port them be­cause they were in the right. The Athe­ni­ans’ re­join­der echoes to this day: The gods are ir­rel­e­vant. What mat­ters is that iron law of na­ture: “The strong do what they can, and the weak suf­fer what they must.” The Melians were un­per­suaded. The Athe­nian en­voys left, only for their army to re­turn to slaugh­ter the men of Me­los and en­slave all its women and chil­dren. It was a text­book ex­am­ple of “re­al­ism” in pol­i­tics.</p>
    <p>Fast for­ward to the present.</p>
    <p>Much has been writ­ten about the par­al­lels be­tween the United States-China ri­valry and the Sparta-Athens power strug­gle. Less ex­am­ined is the Melian Dia­logue as ap­plied to South Asia.</p>
    <p>There are at least two lev­els at which one could ex­plore the sim­i­lar­i­ties. One is be­tween China (Athens) and In­dia (Me­los), and the other be­tween China (Athens) and its neigh­bours, par­tic­u­larly the smaller Hi­malayan states of Nepal and Bhutan (Me­los).</p>
    <p>There’s a ma­jor dif­fer­ence vis-a-vis the clas­si­cal case. At the first level, In­dia is not as weak as Me­los to China’s Athens. But then, it is also not China’s in­ten­tion, nor would it have the ca­pa­bil­ity, to crush a fel­low nu­clear power.</p>
    <p>In the mod­ern con­text, China’s strat­egy in deal­ing with In­dia is more cir­cum­scribed: The goal is not so much to sub­ju­gate its south­ern neigh­bour but to keep In­dia from im­ped­ing China’s rise to be­com­ing peer of the US, by cre­at­ing dif­fi­cul­ties for it to com­pletely align with the US, an al­liance from which the Modi gov­ern­ment has so far held back.</p>
    <p>The sop from China to In­dia has been the lure of “dis­en­gage­ment” along the Line of Ac­tual Con­trol, swop­ping a piece of In­dia’s re­straint for a piece of peace.</p>
    <p>At the sec­ond level, China is cast in the role of Athens while tiny Nepal and Bhutan play the part of Me­los in the strate­gic game.</p>
    <p>Again, there’s a dif­fer­ence from the clas­si­cal case. Here, China has pen­e­trated the outer shell of Nepal, and pos­si­bly even Bhutan, nor­mally treaty-bound with In­dia to align for­eign poli­cies.</p>
    <p>With a nudge and a wink from China, deeply in­volved with Nepal’s in­fra­struc­ture projects, Nepali Prime Min­is­ter K.P. Sharma Oli, a com­mu­nist, feels em­bold­ened to stand up to In­dia. His gov­ern­ment is fan­ning anti-In­dian sen­ti­ments do­mes­ti­cally and has in­cor­po­rated into Nepal’s map some ter­ri­to­ries also claimed by In­dia.</p>
    <p>Tiny Bhutan was al­ready chary of open­ing it­self to re­gional trans­port ar­range­ments link­ing with In­dia for fear of an on­rush of tourists.</p>
    <p>Left to it­self, it would pre­fer direct diplo­matic links with Bei­jing that In­dia would not al­low for. To ex­ert pres­sure, China laid claim to a chunk of Bhutanese ter­ri­tory, cre­at­ing fur­ther awk­ward­ness for In­dia, which is treaty-bound to pro­tect Bhutan’s se­cu­rity.</p>
    <p>The Chi­nese in­tent here is also not to de­stroy the two Meloses, but to wean them from the ad­ver­sary. How the strat­egy will pan out, we are yet to see.</p>
    <p>WHAT LIES AHEAD</p>
    <p>His­tor­i­cally, when a ris­ing power such as China runs up against an ex­ist­ing one, like the US, a mod­icum of in­sta­bil­ity is a nec­es­sary con­se­quence. But war need not be in­evitable. China and the US are too in­ter­linked and con­flict would go against re­al­ist cal­cu­la­tions of self-preser­va­tion. Yet change is an in­ex­orable process. The chal­lenge is to un­der­stand this and, if pos­si­ble, ac­com­mo­date each other’s as­pi­ra­tions, con­vert­ing them into a par­a­digm of mu­tu­ally ben­e­fi­cial re­la­tion­ship.</p>
    <p>A les­son to be learnt from the Pelo­pon­nesian War, cited at the out­set, was that when it ended, so did the sway of both Athens and Sparta. It was swept away by the con­se­quences of that con­flict, paving the way for the emer­gence of Alexan­der of Mace­do­nia from what was then the back­wa­ters of the Hel­lenic civil­i­sa­tion!</p>
