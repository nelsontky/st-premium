    <p>TURIN • Ju­ven­tus have sacked coach Mau­r­izio Sarri af­ter just one sea­son in charge, fol­low­ing the team’s elim­i­na­tion from the Cham­pi­ons League in the round of 16, the Turin club said in a state­ment.</p>
    <p>“Ju­ven­tus Foot­ball Club an­nounces that Mau­r­izio Sarri has been re­lieved of his post as coach of the first team,” it said yesterday.</p>
    <p>“The club would like to thank the coach for hav­ing writ­ten a new page in Ju­ven­tus’ his­tory with the vic­tory of the ninth-con­sec­u­tive cham­pi­onship, the cul­mi­na­tion of a per­sonal jour­ney that led him to climb all the di­vi­sions of Ital­ian foot­ball.”</p>
    <p>Sarri was dis­missed de­spite lead­ing Juve to the Serie A ti­tle last month, their ninth in a row.</p>
    <p>The Ital­ian had been un­der pres­sure since his team lost to Napoli on penal­ties in the fi­nal of the Coppa Italia in June.</p>
    <p>Juve have be­come so dom­i­nant in Serie A in the last decade that win­ning the do­mes­tic league is re­garded as an obli­ga­tion, while the Cham­pi­ons League – which the side have not won since their sec­ond ti­tle in 1996 – is re­garded as their main tar­get. They have been run­ners-up seven times, in­clud­ing twice in the last five years.</p>
    <p>De­spite Cris­tiano Ron­aldo’s dou­ble in a home 2-1 win on Fri­day, Juve fell 2-2 on ag­gre­gate by away goals to French Ligue 1 side Lyon in Europe’s top club com­pe­ti­tion.</p>
    <p>“I am very bit­ter, I un­der­stand how much this com­pe­ti­tion is cursed for Juve,” said Sarri, who had coached 16 dif­fer­ent sides in the lower di­vi­sions of the Ital­ian league, af­ter the match.</p>
    <p>De­spite win­ning the Serie A ti­tle, Sarri’s team have not man­aged to con­vince the crit­ics since he re­placed Mas­si­m­il­iano Al­le­gri last sea­son, af­ter lead­ing Chelsea to suc­cess in the Europa League.</p>
    <p>Their fail­ure to even match last sea­son’s quar­ter-fi­nal per­for­mance in the Cham­pi­ons League had added to the pres­sure on the 61-year-old, who had re­mained de­fi­ant be­fore he was axed yesterday.</p>
    <p>“I don’t think di­rec­tors of a toplevel club will make a de­ci­sion based on one match,” he in­sisted.</p>
    <p>“They are go­ing to eval­u­ate the whole sea­son. I find this kind of ques­tion of­fen­sive. I have a con­tract, I’ll re­spect it.”</p>
    <p>Ital­ian news out­let SportI­talia re­ported that Mauri­cio Po­chet­tino, out of a job since he was dis­missed by Tot­ten­ham last Novem­ber, is the favourite to suc­ceed Sarri.</p>
    <p>Former Juve bosses Al­le­gri and An­to­nio Conte have also been linked with the job in re­cent weeks, along­side club l egends An­drea Pirlo and Zine­dine Zi­dane, the Real Madrid coach.</p>
    <p>Si­mone In­za­ghi is also be­lieved to be in the run­ning. The former Ital­ian in­ter­na­tional guided Lazio back into the Cham­pi­ons League.</p>
    <p>NOTH­ING SE­CRET OR IL­LE­GAL</p>
    <p>I went to these meet­ings... to of­fer our full sup­port and as­sis­tance in con­nec­tion with the on­go­ing in­ves­ti­ga­tions, be­cause Fifa has an in­ter­est and is a dam­aged party in these in­ves­ti­ga­tions. ’’</p>
