    <p>The streets of Seoul qui­etened down yes­ter­day as South Korea en­tered its sec­ond day of tight­ened so­cial dis­tanc­ing aimed at curb­ing a two-week spike that raised coro­n­avirus in­fec­tions to 19,947, with in­door golf sim­u­la­tors closed for the first time while cafe chains of­fered take­outs only.</p>
    <p>How­ever, ques­tions have arisen about the ef­fec­tive­ness of this so­called Level 2.5, out of a three-tier sys­tem which would ban gath­er­ings of more than 10 peo­ple at its strictest. The cur­rent level pro­hibits gath­er­ings of 50 peo­ple in­doors and 100 out­doors.</p>
    <p>Wary of eco­nomic and so­cial reper­cus­sions if so­cial dis­tanc­ing is raised to the high­est Level 3, the health au­thor­i­ties fo­cused ef­forts on dis­cour­ag­ing so­cial gath­er­ings of young peo­ple aged be­tween 20 and 40, who ac­counted for nearly 40 per cent of con­firmed cases last week.</p>
    <p>Cafe chains pop­u­lar for so­cial­is­ing, such as Star­bucks and A Two­some Place, have been or­dered to op­er­ate on take­out or­ders only.</p>
    <p>All restau­rants have to cease op­er­a­tions from 9pm, a move aimed at stop­ping the so­cial prac­tice of go­ing for sec­ond and third rounds of gath­er­ings af­ter din­ner. Take­out and de­liv­ery or­ders are still per­mit­ted from 9pm to 5am.</p>
    <p>In­door sports fa­cil­i­ties pop­u­lar with this age group, in­clud­ing bil­liards and in­door golf, have also been told to close.</p>
    <p>How­ever, ob­servers have ques­tioned if this scheme is ef­fec­tive, point­ing out that cafe en­thu­si­asts can eas­ily switch to non-fran­chise brands while peo­ple can con­tinue to gather in big num­bers at home.</p>
    <p>The Cho­sunBiz news­pa­per said there are “holes ev­ery­where” in the govern­ment’s lat­est pol­icy, not­ing that peo­ple are now chat­ting over cof­fee at bak­ery cafes, fast-food joints and even con­ve­nience stores with out­door seat­ing.</p>
    <p>Golfers, mean­while, are gath­er­ing at out­door driv­ing ranges in­stead of in­door fa­cil­i­ties.</p>
    <p>Inha Univer­sity con­sumer science pro­fes­sor Lee Eun-hee said it is “non­sen­si­cal” to al­low bak­ery cafes to op­er­ate as nor­mal while re­strict­ing cafe chains.</p>
    <p>“Poli­cies made dur­ing this time should be more elab­o­rate and de­tailed. There should not be any quar­an­tine holes, and no con­tro­versy about equal­ity within the in­dus­try,” she said. “The govern­ment should also con­sider how to in­duce the be­hav­iour of con­sumers who value in­di­vid­ual free­dom.”</p>
    <p>The health au­thor­i­ties have urged peo­ple to stay at home and re­frain from join­ing so­cial gath­er­ings as much as pos­si­ble dur­ing a “stand­still week” that lasts till Sun­day.</p>
    <p>The coun­try re­ported 248 new cases yes­ter­day. The death toll stands at 324.</p>
    <p>The num­ber of un­trace­able in­fec­tions has also grown to wor­ry­ing lev­els. The Korea Cen­tres for Disease Con­trol and Preven­tion said yes­ter­day that the ori­gins of 22.7 per cent of the 4,432 cases con­firmed in the past two weeks re­main un­clear, and this is the high­est fig­ure since they started com­pil­ing data in April.</p>
    <p>Se­nior health of­fi­cial Yoon Tae-ho said the goal is to main­tain the down­ward trend of new virus cases. The daily fig­ure has been fall­ing since last Thurs­day’s 441 – the high­est in this round of the out­break. “Tight­ened mea­sures can be eased only if our quar­an­tine sys­tem is deemed to have re­cov­ered its abil­ity to con­trol the virus sit­u­a­tion,” he added.</p>
    <p>Ms Kim Ye-seul, 26, a cus­tomer ser­vice spe­cial­ist, told The Straits Times that she has been work­ing from home since Aug 24, when her com­pany shut down com­pletely.</p>
    <p>“I used to spend my spare time tak­ing bal­let lessons and hang­ing out with friends out­side, but both have been can­celled. Go­ing to cafes for desserts is not safe any more, so I bought a waf­fle maker,” she said.</p>
    <p>Mr Alexan­der Kim, 46, who owns an in­door golf sim­u­la­tor club, said he has re­ceived seven calls from cus­tomers want­ing to make a book­ing, un­aware that his club had been or­dered to close since Sun­day. If it stays open, he will be fined.</p>
    <p>He said: “Of course I worry about in­come, but I also hope the coro­n­avirus sit­u­a­tion will sub­side soon.”</p>
