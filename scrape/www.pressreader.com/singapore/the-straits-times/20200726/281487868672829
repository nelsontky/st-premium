    <p>Sin­ga­pore’s for­mer chief plan­ner came un­der the spot­light for sug­gest­ing that the coun­try should plan for 10 mil­lion peo­ple. But there is more to ur­ban plan­ning than just a num­ber, and what the Repub­lic has achieved is the re­sult of hard work, he says.</p>
    <p>The Sun­day Times finds out more.</p>
    <p>Grow­ing up as a young boy in Sin­ga­pore in the 1940s, Mr Liu Thai Ker won­dered why Bri­tish colo­nial of­fi­cials lived in such dif­fer­ent hous­ing from the lo­cals.</p>
    <p>“The build­ings they oc­cu­pied were very beau­ti­ful,” he says. “But the ar­eas for the lo­cals were di­lap­i­dated and un­painted.”</p>
    <p>Three in four Sin­ga­pore­ans lived in squat­ter hous­ing – un­planned set­tle­ments patched to­gether from scraps of wood, tin and at­tap. As there was no run­ning wa­ter in homes – peo­ple used pails to col­lect wa­ter from stand­pipes.</p>
    <p>But there were sim­ple plea­sures to be found – the song of thou­sands of spar­rows ev­ery evening, as they gath­ered on a tan­gle of over­head tele­phone wires; and the rhyth­mic “kling, kling, kling” of elec­tric trams as they rat­tled through the streets.</p>
    <p>The scenes from his child­hood are a far cry from the gleam­ing Sin­ga­pore sky­line to­day. The man, known as the ar­chi­tect of mod­ern Sin­ga­pore, now runs his own firm in the prime Or­chard Road area.</p>
    <p>He founded Morrow Ar­chi­tects and Plan­ners in 2017, af­ter spend­ing more than two decades in gov­ern­ment ser­vice over­see­ing the mod­erni­sa­tion of Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>Its name is a homage to his fa­ther, pi­o­neer painter Liu Kang, who set up a small sign-paint­ing busi­ness, called Morrow Stu­dio, dur­ing the Ja­panese Oc­cu­pa­tion in Sin­ga­pore. The shop dis­guised the elder Liu’s ed­u­cated back­ground, pro­tect­ing him from be­ing tar­geted as a re­sis­tance fighter by the Ja­panese.</p>
    <p>FORG­ING A SIN­GA­PORE IDEN­TITY</p>
    <p>Born in 1938 in Muar, Jo­hor, as the old­est of five chil­dren, Mr Liu orig­i­nally wanted to be an artist like his fa­ther. Due to his mother’s ob­jec­tions, he stud­ied ar­chi­tec­ture in­stead.</p>
    <p>Af­ter ob­tain­ing his master’s in city plan­ning from Yale Univer­sity in 1965, and spend­ing some time in renowned in­sti­tu­tions, such as with ar­chi­tect I.M. Pei in New York, he re­turned to Sin­ga­pore to lead the Hous­ing Board’s (HDB) de­sign and re­search sec­tion.</p>
    <p>He came up with a pro­to­type for new towns, the self-suf­fi­cient neigh­bour­hood es­tates that Sin­ga­pore is known for to­day.</p>
    <p>As chief plan­ner of the Ur­ban Re­de­vel­op­ment Au­thor­ity (URA) in the 1990s, he con­trib­uted to re­vi­sions to the Con­cept Plan – a plan that arose from the Bri­tish mas­ter­plan for Sin­ga­pore – and had a key hand in con­ser­va­tion projects.</p>
    <p>He ad­mits that he “couldn’t have done a damned thing” as a civil ser­vant, had it not been for the courage and vi­sion of Sin­ga­pore’s pi­o­neer lead­ers, such as found­ing prime min­is­ter Lee Kuan Yew.</p>
    <p>“If they did not have pub­lic hous­ing poli­cies, I could not have built HDB flats. If they did not have the Land Ac­qui­si­tion Act, I could not have got land from the pri­vate sec­tor or squat­ters to build those flats.”</p>
    <p>The beauty of pub­lic hous­ing here, he says, is that it con­sists of a sin­gle pol­icy. “In many cities, they have sev­eral poli­cies: one for the poor­est, and one for the mid­dle-in­come group. This has cre­ated a per­ma­nent seg­re­ga­tion of in­come groups.”</p>
    <p>An in­no­va­tion, he says, was the use of Cen­tral Prov­i­dent Fund sav­ings to buy flats. “If you own a flat, you be­come a share­holder of the coun­try. So you want to take bet­ter care of your flat and your en­vi­ron­ment.”</p>
    <p>The mix­ing of dif­fer­ent eth­nic groups in HDB es­tates also meant that the Chi­nese, Malays and In­di­ans over time saw them­selves as Sin­ga­porean. “So the fact that we have this Sin­ga­porean iden­tity did not come by pure luck, but through a lot of hard work.”</p>
    <p>IM­PACT OF COVID-19</p>
    <p>The URA has said that with more peo­ple work­ing from home due to Covid-19, there will be changes to their com­mut­ing, re­tail con­sump­tion and life­style pat­terns.</p>
    <p>Will Covid-19 lead to a de­cen­tral­i­sa­tion of work and so­cial ac­tiv­i­ties away from the city cen­tre, I ask.</p>
    <p>Mr Liu does not think the changes will be dras­tic, point­ing out that cities have ex­isted for thou­sands of years to meet the hu­man need for so­cial in­ter­ac­tion. He says that even if re­tail shops are re­duced in num­ber and size, peo­ple will still want to go out and so­cialise.</p>
    <p>He also notes that HDB flats have cor­ri­dors that face out­wards, as well as good ven­ti­la­tion and ex­po­sure to sun­light – fea­tures that, co­in­ci­den­tally, help min­imise in­fec­tion trans­mis­sion.</p>
    <p>The URA has said that the Cen­tral Busi­ness District (CBD) could have a larger res­i­den­tial pop­u­la­tion and more mixed uses. The CBD In­cen­tive Scheme an­nounced last year will in­cen­tivise the de­vel­op­ment of older parts of the district into res­i­dences, ho­tels and cre­ative life­style ar­eas.</p>
    <p>Mr Liu, how­ever, would pre­fer to see fewer res­i­dences in the CBD. “Some plan­ners say, ‘Oh, you need to al­low peo­ple to live in the city to give it life’. But you’re lucky if you can fit 50,000 res­i­dents in­side.</p>
    <p>“Do you want the life of the CBD to de­pend on 50,000 or 5.7 mil­lion peo­ple (Sin­ga­pore’s pop­u­la­tion)? The trick is to plan the CBD in such a way that it’s so at­trac­tive, ev­ery­one from Sin­ga­pore will come.”</p>
    <p>THAT 10 MIL­LION QUES­TION</p>
    <p>Re­cently, he found him­self thrust un­der the spot­light for sug­gest­ing that Sin­ga­pore should plan for 10 mil­lion peo­ple to re­main sus­tain­able.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing the gen­eral elec­tion, the Sin­ga­pore Demo­cratic Party claimed that this fig­ure was taken from a Straits Times re­port on re­marks made by Deputy Prime Min­is­ter Heng Swee Keat at a di­a­logue last year.</p>
    <p>Mr Heng had cited Mr Liu in his re­sponse to a ques­tion on the Gov­ern­ment’s 2013 Pop­u­la­tion White Pa­per, but did not him­self men­tion the 10 mil­lion fig­ure.</p>
    <p>Why this num­ber, though?</p>
    <p>Mr Liu says it is not a tar­get but a worst-case sce­nario. Us­ing the anal­ogy of a bank ac­count which has $10 mil­lion in con­tin­gency funds, he says it is a “bless­ing” if one does not use ev­ery sin­gle cent.</p>
    <p>Stress­ing that the num­ber is his per­sonal opin­ion, he says he has not had “any se­ri­ous pro­fes­sional ex­change” with gov­ern­ment of­fi­cials since he left pub­lic ser­vice more than 20 years ago.</p>
    <p>He works out the maths for me – in 1960, there were around 1.6 mil­lion peo­ple in Sin­ga­pore; now, 60 years on, there are 5.7 mil­lion.</p>
    <p>“Let’s say next year, we have 5.8 mil­lion. The in­crease since 1960 is 4.2 mil­lion. If you add this to 5.8 mil­lion, you get 10 mil­lion.”</p>
    <p>If the pop­u­la­tion in­creases at the same rate, the ex­ist­ing plan­ning pa­ram­e­ters will last only another 60 years. If it in­creases at half the rate, the pa­ram­e­ters can only ap­ply for 120 years, and so on, he says.</p>
    <p>“So if we have 10 mil­lion peo­ple, and we don’t start mark­ing out those ad­di­tional ex­press­ways and MRT lines now, where will we find the land when we need it? There will be se­ri­ous traf­fic prob­lems.”</p>
    <p>He poses an ex­is­ten­tial ques­tion: How long do Sin­ga­pore­ans want the coun­try to last as a sov­er­eign state?</p>
    <p>“Don’t we want our chil­dren and grand­chil­dren to stay here for the next few hun­dred, thou­sand years? So, if any­thing at all, (plan­ning for 10 mil­lion) is not ex­ces­sive.”</p>
    <p>This is also why HDB flats come with 99-year leases, he says. If there are more peo­ple than Sin­ga­pore’s land can sup­port, the Gov­ern­ment can take back build­ings, pull them down, and re­build to a higher den­sity.</p>
    <p>What about Sin­ga­pore­ans who fear that the value of their flats will de­crease to zero when the lease runs out?</p>
    <p>“I think cit­i­zens must re­spect that at the end of 99 years, the flat goes back to the Gov­ern­ment – be­cause that’s clearly spelt out in the lease terms,” he says, point­ing out that a sim­i­lar prac­tice ex­ists for arts hous­ing and in­dus­trial ar­eas.</p>
    <p>The Gov­ern­ment also made a con­scious de­ci­sion not to al­low non-cit­i­zens to buy newly built flats, only sec­ond-hand ones, he says, adding that this en­sures re­sale flats have mar­ket value.</p>
    <p>“And it has proven to be the case. Re­sale hous­ing val­ues are higher than the orig­i­nal lease price.”</p>
    <p>PLAN­NING FOR THE FU­TURE</p>
    <p>The 82-year-old Liu shows no sign of slow­ing down. Be­fore the pan­demic, he was in the of­fice nearly ev­ery day. These days, he is more likely to be con­duct­ing a Zoom meet­ing, some­thing that he ad­mits is not his cup of tea.</p>
    <p>He needs to draw, to think, to plan. Even dur­ing this in­ter­view, he is con­stantly scrib­bling key words on a small square of pa­per to or­gan­ise his thoughts.</p>
    <p>While over­seas projects now take up most of his time, Sin­ga­pore’s fu­ture still weighs on his mind.</p>
    <p>First, he hopes that the coun­try’s plan­ners and lead­ers will not dis­card the past, but build on what has been achieved.</p>
    <p>“For ex­am­ple, it’s pop­u­lar to say we lack so­cial spa­ces, but we don’t,” he says, cit­ing the neigh­bour­hood parks, pedes­trian malls, civic cen­tres and play­grounds that have been built.</p>
    <p>Sec­ond, he hopes that more homes for the aged, as well as hos­pi­tals, will be built in res­i­den­tial ar­eas to meet the needs of an age­ing pop­u­la­tion.</p>
    <p>Third, he would like to see more “neat­ness, dig­nity, and clar­ity” in ur­ban plan­ning.</p>
    <p>“I fear there is a ten­dency now to turn our city into an amuse­ment park,” he says, re­fer­ring to what he thinks are com­pli­cated plans that are easy to get lost in.</p>
    <p>Ex­am­ples of what he calls clas­sic beau­ties are the streets of Man­hat­tan and Paris, Moscow’s Red Square and – closer to home – the Padang.</p>
    <p>“Why is the Padang so well loved? If you turn it into a sexy shape, no­body will re­mem­ber it. Cen­tral Park in New York sticks in peo­ple’s minds be­cause it’s a rect­an­gle and so bor­ingly unimag­i­na­tive.”</p>
    <p>He wor­ries that younger Sin­ga­pore­ans will not un­der­stand the amount of ef­fort it took for this coun­try to be­come what it is to­day.</p>
    <p>As the in­ter­view draws to a close, he asks ar­dently: “Have I made you love your coun­try more?”</p>
    <p>He ex­pands fur­ther: “Not only love, but ap­pre­ci­ate what we al­ready have here, which we don’t au­to­mat­i­cally find in other coun­tries. But we take it for granted.”</p>
    <p>SEG­RE­GA­TION OF IN­COME GROUPS</p>
    <p>In many cities, they have sev­eral poli­cies: one for the poor­est, and one for the mid­dle-in­come group. This has cre­ated a per­ma­nent seg­re­ga­tion of in­come ’’ groups.</p>
    <p>MR LIU THAI KER, on the beauty of pub­lic hous­ing in Sin­ga­pore – a sin­gle pol­icy. PLAN­NING FOR 10 MIL­LION</p>
    <p>Don’t we want our chil­dren and grand­chil­dren to stay here for the next few hun­dred, thou­sand years? So, if any­thing at all, (plan­ning for 10 mil­lion) is ’’ not ex­ces­sive.</p>
    <p>MR LIU, pos­ing an ex­is­ten­tial ques­tion – How long do Sin­ga­pore­ans want the coun­try to last as a sov­er­eign state? – when en­gag­ing on the sub­ject of the 10 mil­lion pop­u­la­tion pa­ram­e­ter.</p>
    <p>SEXY SHAPES ARE FOR­GOT­TEN</p>
    <p>Why is the Padang so well loved? If you turn it into a sexy shape, no­body will re­mem­ber it. Cen­tral Park in New York sticks in peo­ple’s minds be­cause it’s a rect­an­gle and so bor­ingly ’’ unimag­i­na­tive.</p>
    <p>MR LIU, on clas­sic beau­ties – the streets of Man­hat­tan and Paris, Moscow’s Red Square – with one closer to home, the Padang.</p>
