    <p>Sin­ga­pore’s pre­ci­sion engi­neer­ing in­dus­try con­tin­ues to hire de­spite the pan­demic, with nearly 1,000 jobs on of­fer since April un­der the SGUnited Jobs and Skills Pack­age.</p>
    <p>Some 76.5 per cent of these roles are for pro­fes­sion­als, man­agers, ex­ec­u­tives and tech­ni­cians (PMETs), in­clud­ing that of prod­uct en­gi­neer, elec­tri­cal and elec­tron­ics en­gi­neer, and qual­ity as­sur­ance in­spec­tor.</p>
    <p>The non-PMET jobs avail­able in­clude those of pro­duc­tion op­er­a­tor, welder and pipe fit­ter, ac­cord­ing to the Min­istry of Man­power.</p>
    <p>The pre­ci­sion engi­neer­ing in­dus­try here plays a role in im­prov­ing man­u­fac­tur­ing pro­cesses and pro­vid­ing sup­port for a wide range of busi­nesses, such as the semi­con­duc­tor, ma­rine and off­shore, aero­space and med­i­cal tech­nol­ogy in­dus­tries.</p>
    <p>A scheme to help lo­cal com­pa­nies with high growth po­ten­tial to scale rapidly will also be en­hanced.</p>
    <p>The level of gov­ern­ment fund­ing for the Scale-up SG scheme will be raised to 80 per cent from 70 per cent un­til Septem­ber next year to lighten cost pres­sures, said Min­is­ter for Trade and In­dus­try Chan Chun Sing yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Nearly 1,000 jobs in the pre­ci­sion engi­neer­ing in­dus­try have been avail­able since April un­der the SGUnited Jobs and Skills Pack­age, with 76.5 per cent of them for pro­fes­sion­als, man­agers, ex­ec­u­tives and tech­ni­cians (PMETs).</p>
    <p>About 750 of the jobs are for PMETs in roles such as prod­uct en­gi­neer, elec­tri­cal and elec­tron­ics en­gi­neer, and qual­ity as­sur­ance in­spec­tor. The re­main­ing 230 non-PMET jobs in­clude those of pro­duc­tion op­er­a­tor, welder and pipe fit­ter.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, there have been about 440 com­pany-hosted trainee­ships and at­tach­ments avail­able in pre­ci­sion engi­neer­ing, with 360 for PMET roles and 80 for non-PMET roles.</p>
    <p>Of the 80 train­ing op­por­tu­ni­ties avail­able, 60 are for PMET roles while 20 are for non-PMET roles.</p>
    <p>The pre­ci­sion engi­neer­ing in­dus­try here plays a cru­cial role in im­prov­ing man­u­fac­tur­ing pro­cesses and pro­vid­ing sup­port for a wide range of busi­nesses, such as the semi­con­duc­tor, ma­rine and off­shore, aero­space and med­i­cal tech­nol­ogy in­dus­tries.</p>
    <p>Salaries for the PMET jobs on of­fer in the pre­ci­sion engi­neer­ing in­dus­try vary ac­cord­ing to the spe­cific job na­ture and skills re­quired.</p>
    <p>For ex­am­ple, in­dus­trial and pro­duc­tion en­gi­neers may earn be­tween $2,600 and $6,000, with the 50th per­centile at $3,350. Man­u­fac­tur­ing engi­neer­ing tech­ni­cians can earn be­tween $1,500 and $2,350, with the 50th per­centile at $1,750.</p>
    <p>Man­power Min­is­ter Josephine Teo, in her weekly jobs sit­u­a­tion re­port yes­ter­day, noted that be­tween April and July this year, more than 260 peo­ple found jobs in the pre­ci­sion engi­neer­ing in­dus­try through the SGUnited Jobs and Skills Pack­age. Two in five of them were mid­ca­reer in­di­vid­u­als who took part in ca­reer con­ver­sion pro­grammes.</p>
    <p>She added that since April, more than 30 job seek­ers have also en­tered com­pany-hosted trainee­ships and at­tach­ments.</p>
    <p>“Some job seek­ers may have the im­pres­sion that the pre­ci­sion engi­neer­ing in­dus­try only hires job seek­ers with tech­ni­cal skills, and choose not to seek out these op­por­tu­ni­ties be­cause they think they lack the nec­es­sary ex­pe­ri­ence,” said Mrs Teo.</p>
    <p>But job seek­ers who are new to the in­dus­try can un­dergo ca­reer con­ver­sion pro­grammes to adapt to their new roles, she said, adding that for most em­ploy­ers, what is key is the will­ing­ness and courage to learn and adapt.</p>
    <p>De­spite the more sub­dued mar­ket, the pre­ci­sion engi­neer­ing in­dus­try man­aged to grow by 11.4 per cent be­tween Jan­uary and July this year com­pared with the same pe­riod last year, said Mrs Teo.</p>
    <p>Among the bet­ter per­form­ers in the in­dus­try are com­pa­nies serv­ing the med­i­cal tech­nol­ogy and semi­con­duc­tor sec­tors, due to in­creased de­mand for Covid-19-re­lated prod­ucts such as di­ag­nos­tic kits and ven­ti­la­tors, she added.</p>
    <p>They in­clude those that sup­ply ma­chin­ery, sys­tems and parts for tech ap­pli­ances to sup­port re­mote work­ing, and com­pa­nies that pro­vide dig­i­tal so­lu­tions such as sen­sors for shops to ad­here to safe dis­tanc­ing guide­lines.</p>
    <p>HELP­ING LO­CAL FIRMS GROW</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, Min­is­ter for Trade and In­dus­try Chan Chun Sing also an­nounced dur­ing the same press brief­ing that the Scale-up SG scheme will be en­hanced, with the level of gov­ern­ment fund­ing raised to 80 per cent from 70 per cent un­til Septem­ber next year to lighten cost pres­sures.</p>
    <p>The pro­gramme also aims to groom an­other 50 com­pa­nies in the next two years, up from a to­tal of 42 firms in the first two batches.</p>
    <p>The Scale-up SG scheme was launched in July last year to help lo­cal com­pa­nies with high-growth po­ten­tial to scale rapidly and even­tu­ally con­trib­ute sig­nif­i­cantly to Sin­ga­pore’s econ­omy.</p>
    <p>“We are go­ing to step up our ef­forts to help many of these good com­pa­nies, as­pir­ing com­pa­nies, to grow, and also to cre­ate more jobs in Sin­ga­pore,” he said.</p>
