    <p>Nav­i­ga­tion app Waze is clos­ing its sales of­fice in Singapore and lay­ing off about 5 per cent of its global work­force, as the Covid-19 pan­demic has re­sulted in fewer ve­hi­cles on the road in many coun­tries.</p>
    <p>In a note to staff, chief ex­ec­u­tive Noam Bardin said Waze users in many cities and coun­tries are driv­ing less or have stopped driv­ing en­tirely due to the on­go­ing pan­demic.</p>
    <p>This has led to a sig­nif­i­cant fall in kilo­me­tres driven, car pools and ad­ver­tis­ing rev­enue, he said in the note, which was pub­lished on Amer­i­can tech­nol­ogy news web­site The Verge on Wed­nes­day.</p>
    <p>“This has forced us to re­think pri­or­i­ties and we’ve de­cided to fo­cus our re­sources on prod­uct im­prove­ments for our users, ac­cel­er­ate our in­vest­ments in tech­ni­cal in­fra­struc­ture, and re­fo­cus our sales and mar­ket­ing ef­forts on a small num­ber of high-value coun­tries,” said Mr Bardin.</p>
    <p>The app, which uses user-sup­plied data to help mo­torists find other routes to avoid traf­fic jams or speed cam­eras, is lay­ing off 30 peo­ple, or 5 per cent of its 555-strong global work­force.</p>
    <p>Mr Bardin did not say how many em­ploy­ees in Singapore are af­fected by the lay­offs.</p>
    <p>Google, which owns the nav­i­ga­tion com­pany, con­firmed the con­tents of Mr Bardin’s note but de­clined to give more de­tails when con­tacted by The Straits Times for com­ment.</p>
    <p>Google ac­quired the Is­raeli startup for re­port­edly more than US$1 bil­lion (S$1.4 bil­lion) in 2013.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to Mr Bardin’s memo, af­fected em­ploy­ees will re­ceive a sev­er­ance pack­age that in­cludes ca­reer tran­si­tion op­por­tu­ni­ties within Google, out­place­ment ser­vices from the date of the no­tice through six months af­ter em­ploy­ment, fi­nan­cial help and el­i­gi­bil­ity for year-end bonuses, and health­care ben­e­fits.</p>
    <p>His note said Waze’s ad­ver­tis­ing sales team will “pare back and fo­cus on the key mar­kets that drive 93 per cent of rev­enue and carry 95 per cent of kilo­me­tres driven we sell in”.</p>
    <p>This means the com­pany will close its sales of­fices in Asia-Pa­cific – Singapore, In­done­sia, the Philip</p>
    <p>pines and Malaysia – as well as in its smaller Latin Amer­ica mar­kets of Colom­bia, Argentina and Chile.</p>
    <p>Mr Bardin added that Waze will con­tinue ser­vic­ing these coun­tries through in­creased in­vest­ments in Waze Lo­cal Starter – a self-ser­vice ad­ver­tis­ing so­lu­tion that busi­nesses can use to pro­mote their phys­i­cal stores via a pin on the Waze map.</p>
    <p>This ef­fort will be sup­ported by the com­pany’s small and medi­um­sized busi­ness teams in its main sales hubs.</p>
    <p>As more peo­ple work from home and do not have to com­mute to their of­fices, Waze is also shrink­ing its car pool part­ner­ships team.</p>
    <p>“Our nar­rowed prod­uct fo­cus also means we’ll re­duce our prod­uct part­ner­ships and pri­vate and pub­lic sec­tor teams,” said Mr Bardin.</p>
    <p>Waze Car­pool al­lows driv­ers to get paid to of­fer rides to peo­ple trav­el­ling on a sim­i­lar route. This ser­vice is not avail­able in Singapore.</p>
    <p>Waze’s fo­cus on fewer mar­kets and ad­just­ments in its part­ner­ship in­vest­ments also means it is re­duc­ing the size of its mar­ket­ing team.</p>
    <p>Also im­pacted is the per­for­mance mar­ket­ing team, which helps ad­ver­tis­ing com­pa­nies tar­get app users while in their cars.</p>
    <p>“We are mak­ing in­vest­ments in prod­ucts to sup­port our growth ef­forts and are re­struc­tur­ing the per­for­mance mar­ket­ing team to re­align around these ef­forts,” Mr Bardin said.</p>
    <p>In a note to staff, chief ex­ec­u­tive Noam Bardin said Waze users in many cities and coun­tries are driv­ing less or have stopped driv­ing en­tirely due to the on­go­ing pan­demic. This has led to a sig­nif­i­cant fall in kilo­me­tres driven, car pools and ad­ver­tis­ing rev­enue, he said in the note, which was pub­lished on Amer­i­can tech­nol­ogy news web­site The Verge on Wed­nes­day.</p>
