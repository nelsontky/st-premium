    <p>(The pan­demic is) caus­ing a lot of panic, heart­break and angst, and it’s scar­ing peo­ple. But we have to re­mem­ber that every­thing we’re fac­ing right now is man-made. And if man made it, man can un­make it, and that’s hope­ful to me.</p>
    <p>AC­TOR AND DI­REC­TOR GE­ORGE CLOONEY, on his be­lief in hu­man­ity’s abil­ity to per­se­vere through crises</p>
    <p>Re­porters who have met ac­tordi­rec­tor Ge­orge Clooney know there are few celebritie­s who ef­fort­lessly ra­di­ate as much charm and good hu­mour in per­son.</p>
    <p>And, at a time when most Hol­ly­wood in­ter­views are tak­ing place over Zoom, the 59-year-old man­ages to do the same over a web cam­era, as he did while dis­cussing his lat­est movie, The Mid­night Sky, which de­buts on Net­flix to­mor­row.</p>
    <p>This is de­spite the film’s premise be­ing rather grim, with the ac­tor play­ing a sci­en­tist try­ing to warn the crew of a space mis­sion not to re­turn to Earth, which a cat­a­clysmic event has ren­dered un­in­hab­it­able.</p>
    <p>Clooney, who also di­rected the film, chat­ted to a hand­ful of re­porters from the home theatre of his six-bed­room man­sion in Los An­ge­les, which he shares with wife and hu­man-rights lawyer Amal, 42, and their three-year-old twins – who, he warns with a smile, might burst in at any minute.</p>
    <p>The Straits Times asks if he thinks hu­man­ity is head­ing for self-ex­tinc­tion like it is in the film</p>
    <p>– and if his as­sess­ment of the odds of that has changed amid the Covid-19 cri­sis and re­cent po­lit­i­cal tur­bu­lence in the United States.</p>
    <p>“No. I’m al­ways an op­ti­mist. And a re­al­ist – I do be­lieve in look­ing at things head on. But I also be­lieve in our bet­ter an­gels,” says the star, who won the Best Pic­ture Os­car for pro­duc­ing the his­tor­i­cal drama Argo (2012) and Best Sup­port­ing Ac­tor for the po­lit­i­cal thriller Syr­i­ana (2005).</p>
    <p>The Grav­ity (2013) and Ocean’s Eleven (2001) ac­tor ul­ti­mately be­lieves the late civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr’s as­ser­tion that “the arc of his­tory is long, but it bends to­wards jus­tice”.</p>
    <p>It just takes a long time to get there, says the ac­tor, a phi­lan­thropist and po­lit­i­cal ac­tivist who has sup­ported hu­man­i­tar­ian causes in Dar­fur (in Su­dan), Syria and Ar­me­nia.</p>
    <p>“I be­lieve the same thing about our ig­nor­ing sci­ence, which is just a tem­po­rary thing be­cause peo­ple are try­ing to make money.</p>
    <p>“I do be­lieve we’re go­ing to head in the right di­rec­tion,” he con­cludes. “We have a few pit stops along the way where we do id­i­otic things, but I think the world in gen­eral is go­ing to fig­ure it out.</p>
    <p>I’m al­ways op­ti­mistic about that.”</p>
    <p>Clooney ac­knowl­edges that the pan­demic is “caus­ing a lot of panic, heart­break and angst, and it’s scar­ing peo­ple”.</p>
    <p>“But we have to re­mem­ber that every­thing we’re fac­ing right now is man-made. And if man made it, man can un­make it, and that’s hope­ful to me.</p>
    <p>“With any luck, we’re see­ing some light at the end of the tun­nel with th­ese vac­cines and I’m very hope­ful that by late spring, we might all be able to do this in a room to­gether. I’d like to never hear the word Zoom again,” he says.</p>
    <p>With Los An­ge­les un­der rolling lock­down mea­sures to con­tain the spread of Covid-19 since March, Clooney has been spend­ing more time than he other­wise would at home with his chil­dren Ella and Alexan­der.</p>
    <p>And he loves it. “It’s been great be­cause we get to spend time to­gether. I get to wake them up in the morn­ing and put them to bed at night. I’m very lucky in that sense; I’m not in a po­si­tion that many peo­ple in the world are.</p>
    <p>“Would I like to get out of the house ev­ery once in a while? Yeah. They turned my of­fice into a nurs­ery – I had to hide a bot­tle of tequila in a stuffed bear some­where so I can get through it,” he says with a chuckle.</p>
    <p>“I’m in the theatre where I edit be­cause this is all that I have left. They’ve taken over my life, th­ese kids. But I wel­come the in­ter­rup­tion,” he says, his face soft­en­ing. “It’s fun when the kids come in and in­ter­rupt a Zoom, like they’ve done many times.”</p>
    <p>Clooney says he has also be­come more con­fi­dent as a par­ent in re­cent months.</p>
    <p>“I dis­cov­ered that noth­ing re­ally can get to you. I al­ways thought I’d be over­whelmed by cer­tain things, like if a kid falls down.”</p>
    <p>But “all of my pre­tend­ing to be a pae­di­a­tri­cian on (the 1994 to 2009 tele­vi­sion se­ries) ER has come in very help­ful, as I pre­tend to be a doc­tor when my kid splits his lip when he falls down”.</p>
    <p>“I hope, in life, I’m learn­ing stuff as I go no mat­ter what,” he adds. “And in lock­down, the only thing it does is put it all on steroids.”</p>
    <p>The Mid­night Sky de­buts on Net­flix to­mor­row.</p>
