    <p>Sev­eral years ago, ac­tor Nick Shen sup­ported two friends, both now in their early 30s, who had sui­ci­dal thoughts. Shen says one of them, who at­tempted sui­cide, had schizophre­nia and spoke of peo­ple try­ing to “catch” him.</p>
    <p>The other friend had re­la­tion­ship and fam­ily prob­lems and cut her­self. Shen ac­com­pa­nied her on her vis­its to the In­sti­tute of Men­tal Health.</p>
    <p>“Re­silience is im­por­tant for ev­ery­one,” says Shen, who is in his early 40s. He was re­cently made an ambassador for Hap­pYouth, a youth wellness pro­gramme by the char­ity Char­ac­ter & Lead­er­ship Acad­emy, to­gether with Nick Vu­ji­cic, a mo­ti­va­tional speaker from Australia who was born with­out arms and legs.</p>
    <p>Shen says per­se­ver­ance is key to over­com­ing chal­lenges, in­clud­ing men­tal health prob­lems. He learnt this value over the years. When he was 13, his father be­rated him as be­ing “the shame of the fam­ily” for want­ing to pur­sue Chi­nese opera.</p>
    <p>Shen, owner of Lao Sai Tao Yuan Teochew Opera Troupe and founder of events com­pany Tok Tok Chi­ang, was also the main care­giver for his dying mother for five years. She died more than 10 years ago from colon and liver can­cer.</p>
    <p>The bach­e­lor re­calls: “I was act­ing full time with Me­di­a­corp then. I also needed to act for my mother and ap­pear strong to give her re­as­sur­ance.”</p>
    <p>There are a few events to mark</p>
    <p>World Sui­cide Pre­ven­tion Day on Thurs­day, which pro­mote re­silience and men­tal wellness in youth.</p>
    <p>Hap­pYouth is run­ning its #GateKeep­ingLives #Hap­pYouth cam­paign (face­book.com/CLAFu­tuReady) from Thurs­day to Oct 10, which is World Men­tal Health Day.</p>
    <p>An on­line men­tal wellness and sui­cide pre­ven­tion event, Dif­fer­ence in YOUth 2020 (face­book.com/ carecorner­sg), runs from Thurs­day to Satur­day. It is jointly or­gan­ised by Care Cor­ner Youth Ser­vices and North East Com­mu­nity De­vel­op­ment Coun­cil.</p>
