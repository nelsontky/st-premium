    <p>LOS AN­GE­LES • On Thurs­day last week, Buz­zfeed News pub­lished an ex­plo­sive re­port ex­pos­ing the re­al­i­ties of work­ing on the set of The Ellen DeGeneres Show.</p>
    <p>De­scrib­ing the work­place as a “toxic work en­vi­ron­ment’, for­mer em­ploy­ees re­vealed shock­ing anec­dotes of bul­ly­ing, racism and in­tim­i­da­tion.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to Us Weekly mag­a­zine, a source “con­nected to the talk show’s pro­duc­tion” said staff have been “call­ing and tex­ting each other about the story”, which has been widely read. “They’re loving that the truth – which has been an open se­cret for years in the in­dus­try – is fi­nally re­ceiv­ing more in­ter­est,” the source added.</p>
    <p>While DeGeneres has yet to make an of­fi­cial state­ment, ex­ec­u­tive pro­duc­ers Ed Glavin, Mary Con­nelly and Andy Lass­ner said, in a joint state­ment to Buz­zfeed News, that they take their em­ploy­ees’ sto­ries “very se­ri­ously”.</p>
    <p>Say­ing they have “strived to cre­ate an open, safe and in­clu­sive work en­vi­ron­ment”, they added that they were “truly heart­bro­ken and sorry to learn that even one per­son in our pro­duc­tion fam­ily has had a neg­a­tive ex­pe­ri­ence”.</p>
    <p>The ex­ec­u­tive pro­duc­ers said: “The day-to-day re­spon­si­bil­ity of The Ellen Show is com­pletely on us. We take all of this very se­ri­ously and we re­alise, as many in the world are learn­ing, that we need to do bet­ter, are com­mit­ted to do bet­ter and we will do bet­ter.”</p>
