    <p>The Demo­cratic Party con­ven­tion will of­fi­cially nom­i­nate Mr Joe Bi­den as its can­di­date to con­front US Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump at the Nov 3 elec­tion, but the event could be up­staged by Mr Trump. He was set to be­gin his own cam­paign tour yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>WASHINGTON • This week, the eyes of US vot­ers turn to Mr Joe Bi­den, Ms Ka­mala Har­ris and the Demo­cratic con­ven­tion – un­less they swivel first to Repub­li­can dis­tracter-in-chief Don­ald Trump.</p>
    <p>For the Democrats, the con­ven­tion is the real 2020 cam­paign launch, cul­mi­nat­ing on Thurs­day when Mr Bi­den ac­cepts the nom­i­na­tion to con­front Mr Trump on Nov 3.</p>
    <p>The in­cum­bent Pres­i­dent, how­ever, loves noth­ing more than steal­ing the show.</p>
    <p>So when the Demo­cratic cel­e­bra­tion – al­ready low-key due to coro­n­avirus pre­cau­tions – kicked off yes­ter­day, Mr Trump was set to be­gin his own cam­paign tour with speeches in the bat­tle­ground states of Wis­con­sin and Min­nesota.</p>
    <p>To­day, Mr Trump will be back on Air Force One to speak in Ari­zona.</p>
    <p>And on Thurs­day, the big­gest mo­ment in Mr Bi­den’s po­lit­i­cal life, Mr Trump is turn­ing the troll fac­tor to max­i­mum with a speech next to Scran­ton, Penn­syl­va­nia – the bluecol­lar town where Mr Bi­den grew up and which he still refers to as his spir­i­tual home.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to the Trump cam­paign, the theme of this week’s tour will be sim­ple enough: “High­light­ing Joe Bi­den’s record of fail­ure”.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump feels at his best in front of a live au­di­ence. While he has also can­celled his big Repub­li­can con­ven­tion due to Covid-19 curbs, he still plans to give his main speech in front of guests in just un­der two weeks at the White House.</p>
    <p>But hit­ting the road car­ries con­sid­er­able risks.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump’s last at­tempt to stage one of his beloved ral­lies, an event in Ok­la­homa in June, was a flop when few sup­port­ers showed up.</p>
    <p>And this week, he will be com­pet­ing with the Democrats’ top stars, all of them nearly des­per­ate to make him a one-term pres­i­dent.</p>
    <p>They in­clude former first lady Michelle Obama and former pres­i­den­tial hope­ful Bernie San­ders who were to speak yes­ter­day, and former pres­i­dent Barack Obama and Mr Bi­den’s newly minted vice-pres­i­den­tial pick, Ms Har­ris, sched­uled for to­mor­row.</p>
    <p>But what if Mr Trump just ends up en­er­gis­ing his op­po­nents?</p>
    <p>“The big­gest prob­lem for Pres­i­dent Trump right now is the more he speaks, the worse he does,” Prince­ton Uni­ver­sity pol­i­tics pro­fes­sor Ju­lian Zelizer said on CNN.</p>
    <p>“I am not sure hav­ing more of Pres­i­dent Trump out there in the next few days will nec­es­sar­ily hurt Democrats. It might be ex­actly what they need.”</p>
    <p>A vet­eran of re­al­ity TV and some­thing of a ge­nius at self-pro­mo­tion, Mr Trump en­tered pol­i­tics with a knack for iden­ti­fy­ing op­po­nents’ weak spots and turn­ing them into cen­tral cam­paign themes.</p>
    <p>In 2016, his catch­phrase of then Demo­cratic pres­i­den­tial can­di­date Hil­lary Clin­ton – “crooked Hil­lary” – stuck. In un­prece­dented, ugly scenes, he en­cour­aged crowds to chant “lock her up”.</p>
    <p>Tra­di­tion­al­ists were ap­palled, but Mr Trump was tap­ping widely held mis­trust of the Clin­ton brand and his attacks, how­ever crude, hurt the far more ex­pe­ri­enced op­po­nent.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing the Demo­cratic pri­maries, Mr Trump like­wise ped­dled de­lib­er­ately in­sult­ing yet catchy nick­names for what many thought were the strong­est can­di­dates – “Crazy Bernie” San­ders and “Poc­a­hon­tas” El­iz­a­beth War­ren.</p>
    <p>Against Mr Bi­den and Ms Har­ris, how­ever, Mr Trump seems sud­denly less sure of him­self.</p>
    <p>The duo are from the cen­tre of the Demo­cratic Party, making them far more slip­pery tar­gets.</p>
    <p>And Ms Har­ris in par­tic­u­lar ap­pears to trou­ble the Pres­i­dent.</p>
    <p>A former pros­e­cu­tor, she does not fit eas­ily into his cen­tral cam­paign mes­sage about Democrats be­ing soft on crime. His test­ing of ad­jec­tives for her like “nasty” and “dis­re­spect­ful” seem un­likely to en­dear him with women vot­ers.</p>
    <p>An ABC/Washington Post poll on Sun­day found that 54 per cent of Amer­i­cans ap­prove of Ms Har­ris and just 29 per cent do not.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump also seems to be los­ing some of his self-as­sur­ance over how to tackle Mr Bi­den.</p>
    <p>For months, he has pushed the view that Mr Obama’s former vicepres­i­dent, whom he nick­names “Sleepy Joe”, is se­nile and un­fit for of­fice. Yet polls con­tinue to show the Democrat with com­mand­ing leads in swing states and even threat­en­ing Repub­li­can heart­lands.</p>
    <p>Re­flect­ing his frus­tra­tion, Mr Trump turned to a crowd of sup­port­ers from the New York Po­lice Depart­ment last Fri­day for help, ask­ing if per­haps he had a prob­lem with the nick­name.</p>
    <p>“What’s bet­ter, ‘ Sleepy Joe’ or ‘Slow Joe’?” he asked.</p>
    <p>“I go back and forth.”</p>
    <p>Cheers for “Sleepy Joe” came louder and the Pres­i­dent nod­ded.</p>
    <p>“That’s what I thought,” he said.</p>

The duo are from the cen&#xAD;tre of the Demo&#xAD;cratic Party, making them far harder for Pres&#xAD;i&#xAD;dent Don&#xAD;ald Trump to tar&#xAD;get.</p>
