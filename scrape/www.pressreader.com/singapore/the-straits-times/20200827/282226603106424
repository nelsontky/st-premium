    <p>HANOI • For the past three decades, Viet­nam has known only good – or great – eco­nomic news.</p>
    <p>Its growth as an ex­porter, pro­pelled by com­mu­nist lead­ers who em­braced mar­ket-ori­ented poli­cies in the late 1980s, pushed many into the mid­dle class.</p>
    <p>The Covid-19 pan­demic changed all that.</p>
    <p>With gar­ment com­pa­nies see­ing or­ders slashed and other sec­tors hit with sud­den ex­port de­clines, Viet­nam’s work­ers are en­dur­ing the down­side of be­ing teth­ered to the global econ­omy.</p>
    <p>The slow­down i n the United States and other ex­port mar­kets is be­ing felt on the streets of Ho Chi Minh City and Hanoi, as well as in vil­lages and tourist cen­tres.</p>
    <p>Ms Le Thi Hoa, who sells fruit slices out­side Ho Chi Minh City’s Ben Thanh Mar­ket in the com­mer­cial hub, said: “Now, peo­ple don’t go out. I can sell only about a third of what I did be­fore the epi­demic.”</p>
    <p>Viet­nam has been one of glob­al­i­sa­tion’s stars, trans­form­ing it­self from a largely agri­cul­tural econ­omy into a man­u­fac­tur­ing pow­er­house within a few decades.</p>
    <p>The econ­omy ex­panded 7.02 per cent last year, but now it is brac­ing it­self for the slow­est growth in two decades – 2.4 per cent this year.</p>
    <p>Mr Ralf Matthaes, man­ag­ing di­rec­tor of In­fo­cus Mekong Re­search, who has lived in the coun­try since 1994, noted: “This is the first time since join­ing the global eco­nomic com­mu­nity two decades ago that Viet­nam is ex­pe­ri­enc­ing a sig­nif­i­cant eco­nomic down­turn.”</p>
    <p>Viet­nam’s abrupt slump high­lights how even coun­tries that have been rel­a­tively suc­cess­ful in con­tain­ing the virus that causes Covid-19 are un­able to avoid its eco­nomic af­flic­tions.</p>
    <p>“Coun­tries that are ex­port-ori­ented will re­main vul­ner­a­ble,” said Ms Sian Fen­ner, a Sin­ga­pore-based economist at Ox­ford Eco­nomics, which fore­casts an 8 per cent con­trac­tion in global trade for this year.</p>
    <p>Viet­nam’s ex­ports plum­meted 14 per cent in April from a year ear­lier, fol­lowed by a drop of 12.4 per cent in May as global com­merce came to a stand­still.</p>
    <p>Ex­ports rose just 1.5 per cent in the seven months to last month com­pared with 8 per cent last year.</p>
    <p>The gov­ern­ment, grap­pling with an out­break in Danang that has spread to 14 prov­inces and cities, has won in­ter­na­tional re­spect for its virus con­tain­ment.</p>
    <p>Un­til July 31, it had not re­ported a sin­gle death. It con­firmed 1,029 virus cases and 27 deaths as at Tues­day as of­fi­cials em­ploy tough an­tivirus mea­sures, while al­low­ing man­u­fac­tur­ing to op­er­ate.</p>
    <p>Though Viet­nam is i n bet­ter shape than other Asian economies, its re­liance on for­eign mar­kets and tourism have given its res­i­dents a les­son in global volatil­ity.</p>
    <p>Viet­nam has be­come a key cog in the global sup­ply chain.</p>
    <p>It has opened fac­to­ries for firms that in­clude In­tel, Sam­sung Elec­tron­ics and LG Elec­tron­ics, as well as so­lar panel mak­ers and gar­ment pro­duc­ers.</p>
    <p>Ex­ports last year reached US$264.3 bil­lion (S$361.4 bil­lion) – a four­fold jump since 2008. Av­er­age an­nual pay rose from US$1,154 to about US$2,800 in that pe­riod, ac­cord­ing to gov­ern­ment data.</p>
    <p>The pace of Viet­nam’s ship­ments to the US, which rep­re­sented about 23 per cent of ex­ports last year, slowed in the first half of this year over the same pe­riod last year.</p>
    <p>Hard-hit sec­tors such as gar­ments and tex­tiles em­ploy mil­lions of low-skilled work­ers. Sam­sung’s Viet­nam unit, whose elec­tron­ics prod­ucts rep­re­sented about 20 per cent of to­tal ex­ports last year, re­vised its fore­cast for this year to US$45.5 bil­lion, a US$13.5 bil­lion drop from last year.</p>
    <p>TOURISM WOES</p>
    <p>The tourism in­dus­try, which rep­re­sents about 9 per cent of the econ­omy, had a 55.4 per cent rev­enue drop dur­ing the first seven months of the year. Given the pound­ing to man­u­fac­tur­ing and hos­pi­tal­ity in­dus­tries, al­most a third of the pop­u­la­tion – 31 mil­lion work­ers – took a hit in the sec­ond quar­ter.</p>
    <p>The pain has been ex­ac­er­bated by the vir­tual lock­down for much of April amid the new out­break.</p>
    <p>With mil­lions of em­ploy­ees out of work, lo­cal gov­ern­ments worry about the po­ten­tial for so­cial un­rest, said Mr Fred Burke, man­ag­ing part­ner at the Baker McKen­zie law firm in Ho Chi Minh City, not­ing that the gov­ern­ment re­cently pleaded with firms not to fire their work­ers but to keep them as long as they could.</p>
    <p>Con­sumer con­fi­dence is at its low­est point in 25 years, said In­fo­cus Mekong Re­search. Two-thirds of res­i­dents are de­fer­ring or de­cid­ing not to make big pur­chases. And 63 per cent are con­sid­er­ing tak­ing out loans as they seek fi­nan­cial lifeboats, the re­search firm said.</p>
    <p>Gar­ment firm ex­ec­u­tive Bui Viet Nam, 34, noted: “In­comes are go­ing down and peo­ple are think­ing about ways to earn through sell­ing things on­line or get­ting a part-time job. It’s a new world.”</p>
