    <p>Sin­ga­pore pol­i­cy­mak­ers are walk­ing a tightrope in their ef­forts to man­age ris­ing un­em­ploy­ment amid the na­tion’s worst re­ces­sion since in­de­pen­dence.</p>
    <p>It is a balanc­ing act be­tween sav­ing jobs for lo­cals and keep­ing the labour mar­ket open to global com­pe­ti­tion – the long­stand­ing norm that has shaped Sin­ga­pore’s econ­omy into a hub of fi­nance, trade and man­u­fac­tur­ing hard­wired to the global net­work of sup­ply and value chains.</p>
    <p>But the re­liance on global mar­kets is a dilemma as well.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore reaps op­ti­mum ben­e­fits when the world econ­omy is chug­ging along nicely – there are plenty of jobs, busi­nesses are grow­ing and prices are un­der con­trol.</p>
    <p>But this also puts it in the bas­ket of coun­tries that suf­fer the most when there is a global eco­nomic slow­down or fi­nan­cial cri­sis.</p>
    <p>That is why the Re­pub­lic needs to con­stantly rein­vent and re­struc­ture its econ­omy, and con­tin­u­ally up­grade skills of its labour force to match the de­mand for new job roles.</p>
    <p>Given the small size of the pop­u­la­tion, it is ob­vi­ous that a buf­fer work­force is re­quired to fill the gaps left be­hind by the lo­cals.</p>
    <p>There are labour-in­ten­sive jobs which lo­cals tend to shun, and on the higher end of the talent and skills gauge, for­eign­ers are re­quired to spear­head busi­nesses ven­tur­ing into more com­pet­i­tive rungs of the global value chain – biomed and pre­ci­sion en­gi­neer­ing, for in­stance.</p>
    <p>At the same time, there are lim­i­ta­tions and curbs set for for­eign­ers in Sin­ga­pore’s employment frame­work to pre­vent the marginal­i­sa­tion of the lo­cal work­force or, worse, a brain drain.</p>
    <p>The fire­fight­ing mea­sures to save liveli­hoods from the con­se­quences of Covid-19 con­tain­ment mea­sures may con­tinue for months.</p>
    <p>There is also a na­tion­wide de­bate on how to help busi­nesses re­tain as many work­ers as pos­si­ble and how to put the re­trenched back to work.</p>
    <p>The hope is that from the ashes of the cri­sis will emerge a con­sen­sus on ad­dress­ing some of the struc­tural is­sues of un­em­ploy­ment that pre­date the pandemic-in­duced re­ces­sion as well.</p>
    <p>Over­all un­em­ploy­ment in Sin­ga­pore has his­tor­i­cally been lower than most of its trad­ing part­ners. The an­nual av­er­age un­em­ploy­ment rate last year was 2.3 per cent, com­pared with Asia’s 3.46 per cent. But it is the struc­ture of un­em­ploy­ment in Sin­ga­pore that is wor­ry­ing.</p>
    <p>The job­less rate for cit­i­zens has been per­sis­tently higher. Af­ter sta­bil­is­ing at 2.9 per cent from 2013 to 2015, it rose to 3.3 per cent at the end of last year, ac­cord­ing to Min­istry of Man­power data.</p>
    <p>The an­nual av­er­age res­i­dent long-term un­em­ploy­ment rate – those un­em­ployed for 12 months or more – was steady at 0.7 per cent last year from a year ear­lier, but up from 0.5 per cent in 2015.</p>
    <p>Un­em­ploy­ment has also been higher on the ends of the age spec­trum. For in­stance, the gauge last year rose to 0.9 per cent from 0.6 per cent in 2018 for those aged be­low 30. For job seek­ers above 50, the rate rose to 1 per cent last year from 0.9 per cent in 2018.</p>
    <p>In the fourth quar­ter of last year, about seven in 10, or 73.8 per cent, of re­trenched lo­cals were pro­fes­sion­als, man­agers, ex­ec­u­tives and tech­ni­cians (PMETs).</p>
    <p>By ed­u­ca­tion pro­file, more than half of the re­trenched lo­cals, or</p>
    <p>51.9 per cent, were de­gree hold­ers.</p>
    <p>The Covid-19 pandemic has fur­ther wors­ened the sit­u­a­tion.</p>
    <p>By March, the long-term un­em­ploy­ment rate for those be­low 30 years old had risen to 1 per cent, while the rate was up to 1.1 per cent for those aged 50 and above. The trend in­di­cates the bur­den of un­em­ploy­ment is con­cen­trated on a rel­a­tively small num­ber of peo­ple who are at risk of per­ma­nent de­tach­ment from the labour mar­ket.</p>
    <p>The wage growth in the past decade shows what the un­em­ploy­ment num­bers do not.</p>
    <p>The me­dian gross monthly in­come of full-time em­ployed res­i­dents has grown by 32.5 per cent on a real cu­mu­la­tive ba­sis to $4,563 last year from $2,927 in 2009.</p>
    <p>Ris­ing un­em­ploy­ment among lo­cals, de­spite the stel­lar wage growth, shows that while the econ­omy has been able to cre­ate bet­ter-pay­ing jobs, the jobs are prob­a­bly con­cen­trated in sec­tors for which both lo­cal young job seek­ers and ex­pe­ri­enced pro­fes­sion­als lack the skills. On this front, the Gov­ern­ment has al­ways shown a will­ing­ness to do more for skills up­grad­ing and train­ing.</p>
    <p>The other pos­si­bil­ity is that lo­cals have not been able to com­pete with for­eign talent on pay scale.</p>
    <p>If that is true, then the idea that the for­eign work­force – 1.42 mil­lion last year – is a buf­fer stands challenged and has given rise to de­mands for a re­cal­i­bra­tion of the for­eign work­force pol­icy.</p>
    <p>But it is hard to move for­ward on this, given the lack of his­tor­i­cal data on salary struc­tures and num­bers of lo­cals and for­eign­ers, bro­ken down to the small­est seg­ment of the three big sec­tors – ser­vices, man­u­fac­tur­ing and con­struc­tion.</p>
    <p>The pub­lished un­em­ploy­ment data pro­vides only a broad snap­shot of the labour mar­ket and shows that for­eign­ers, in­clud­ing for­eign do­mes­tic work­ers, formed about 38 per cent of the to­tal work­force last De­cem­ber.</p>
    <p>The fig­ures also show that job growth in the ser­vices sec­tor has been much faster than the other two big sec­tors in the past decade to ac­count for the bulk of employment – about 74 per cent, of which 30 per cent are for­eign­ers.</p>
    <p>Data trans­parency could help en­cour­age a more in­formed dis­cus­sion, rather than a dis­course based on anec­dotes.</p>
    <p>In­stead of changes to the min­i­mum salary re­quire­ments for var­i­ous passes at ir­reg­u­lar in­ter­vals, the lim­its can be bench­marked to in­dexes tied to macroe­co­nomic in­di­ca­tors, such as wage growth, in­fla­tion and salary ex­pec­ta­tions of fresh grad­u­ates. That may give em­ploy­ers more cer­tainty on the tra­jec­tory of the job mar­ket.</p>
    <p>The quan­ti­ta­tive part – salaries and num­bers – of the labour mar­ket’s bal­ance be­tween lo­cals and for­eign­ers is man­age­able. How­ever, the qual­i­ta­tive part – trans­fer of knowl­edge and skills from for­eign­ers to lo­cals – will re­main a chal­lenge.</p>
    <p>If a cer­tain busi­ness seg­ment needs the same or higher num­ber of for­eign­ers year af­ter year, then it can be as­sumed that the knowl­edge trans­fer is not hap­pen­ing.</p>
    <p>That re­quires deeper anal­y­sis, and such stud­ies can help the Gov­ern­ment to fo­cus its reskilling and work­place train­ing ef­forts.</p>
