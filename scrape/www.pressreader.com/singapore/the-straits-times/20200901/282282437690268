    <p>A group of six peo­ple will be run­ning the dis­tance from Jo­hor Baru to Kuala Lumpur this weekend, ex­cept that the run­ning will take place at East Coast Park­way.</p>
    <p>The run­ners, from lo­cal run­ning group The High Pan­ters, aim to cover at least 300km in 31hr 15min in a re­lay ul­tra­ma­rathon that is part of The Speed Project (TSP) in the United States.</p>
    <p>And The High Pan­ters hopes oth­ers in Sin­ga­pore will also go for a run this weekend – wher­ever they are – so that a to­tal dis­tance of 869km can be cov­ered in 48 hours to raise funds for meals for health­care work­ers and the needy.</p>
    <p>The High Pan­ters and other run­ners from all over the world are tak­ing part in TSP, a 340 mile (550km) re­lay race from Santa Mon­ica Pier in Los An­ge­les to Las Ve­gas. Due to the coro­n­avirus pan­demic, the race is go­ing virtual this year.</p>
    <p>The Sin­ga­pore group wants to also raise funds for those im­pacted by the Covid-19 pan­demic through run­ning the race.</p>
    <p>Said co-founder Eu­gene Lim, 40: “We want to do some­thing even big­ger than the run it­self, be­yond our­selves, and we know we can do some­thing for the community in Sin­ga­pore.”</p>
    <p>So last month, Mr Lim reached out to the Ma­ju­lah Move­ment – an ini­tia­tive founded in May that dis­trib­utes meals to health­care staff, mi­grant work­ers and se­niors from low-in­come fam­i­lies – to dis­cuss how he could con­trib­ute.</p>
    <p>The two par­ties came up with the idea of get­ting more peo­ple to run so as to cover the 869km target this weekend. That was the to­tal dis­tance the Ma­ju­lah Move­ment team cov­ered in their food de­liv­er­ies in the past three months, said Ms Ling Quek, 37.</p>
    <p>Ms Quek, who co-founded the Ma­ju­lah Move­ment, said that ev­ery kilo­me­tre clocked by a run­ner will raise funds for meals. If the target of 869km is achieved, the ben­e­fi­cia­ries would get at least 1,500 meals, which could last for over a month.</p>
    <p>Mr Lim’s team of six run­ners is tar­get­ing to cover at least 300km of the 869km.</p>
    <p>Mem­bers of the pub­lic who wish to par­tic­i­pate have to record their own dis­tances and send a screen­shot to the Ma­ju­lah Move­ment via In­sta­gram.</p>
    <p>Mr Lim said he has al­ways wanted to join a cross-coun­try race af­ter be­ing in­spired by Cana­dian ath­lete and cancer re­search ac­tivist Terry Fox at a young age, and TSP is a race that he has been in­ter­ested in.</p>
    <p>The virtual for­mat of the race this year will al­low par­tic­i­pants from around the world to clock as many kilo­me­tres as pos­si­ble within the cur­rent record time of 31 hours and 15 min­utes for the LA-to-Ve­gas run.</p>
    <p>Although he will be run­ning in Sin­ga­pore, Mr Lim wants to see where his team stands in this global race. His team mem­bers are Mr Eu­gene Teo, 40; Mr Ben­jamin Lee, 33; Mr Chua Kim Choon, 48; Ms Faye Kwan, 36; and Ms Wendy Chu, 40.</p>
    <p>To­gether with the over­seas par­tic­i­pants, the team will start run­ning at 7pm on Satur­day, which will be 4am Pa­cific Day­light Time. The race will end at 2.15am Sin­ga­pore time on Mon­day.</p>
    <p>If they run at a con­sis­tent pace of six min­utes per kilo­me­tre with each cov­er­ing 50km, they will be able to achieve at least 300km in the spec­i­fied time.</p>
    <p>On get­ting the pub­lic’s par­tic­i­pa­tion to raise funds for the Ma­ju­lah Move­ment, Mr Lim said: “You don’t have to come to East Coast Park­way to run. You can run around your neigh­bour­hood, it doesn’t mat­ter where you are, you can con­trib­ute to the mileage.”</p>
    <p>FOR THE GOOD OF THE COMMUNITY</p>
    <p>We want to do some­thing even big­ger than the run it­self, be­yond our­selves, and we know we can do some­thing for the community in Sin­ga­pore.’’</p>
    <p>MR EU­GENE LIM, co-founder of The High Pan­ters, on want­ing to also raise funds for those im­pacted by the Covid-19 pan­demic.</p>
    <p>CON­TRIBUT­ING WHER­EVER YOU ARE</p>
    <p>You don’t have to come to East Coast Park­way to run. You can run around your neigh­bour­hood, it doesn’t mat­ter where you are, you can con­trib­ute to the mileage.’’</p>
    <p>MR LIM, whose team hopes that other peo­ple in Sin­ga­pore will also go for a run this weekend so that a to­tal dis­tance of 869km can be cov­ered in 48 hours to raise funds for meals for health­care work­ers and the needy.</p>
