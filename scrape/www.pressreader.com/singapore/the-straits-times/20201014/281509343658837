    <p>The step-fam­ily of Mustafa Cen­tre boss Mus­taq Ah­mad lev­elled se­ri­ous al­le­ga­tions against him yesterday, ac­cus­ing him of cheat­ing his fa­ther, his step­mother and his stepsi­b­lings so that he, his wife and his chil­dren could “line their pock­ets”.</p>
    <p>The al­le­ga­tions came at the start of a 34-day hear­ing into a suit brought against Mr Mus­taq and his fam­ily by his five step-sib­lings and their mother, with each side ac­cus­ing the other of “in­sa­tiable” greed.</p>
    <p>The step-fam­ily, led by Mr Ayaz Ahmed, is ask­ing the High Court for an or­der to wind up Mohamed Mustafa and Sam­sud­din Co (MMSC), the com­pany be­hind the pop­u­lar depart­ment store.</p>
    <p>A liq­uida­tor should be ap­pointed to look into the af­fairs and records of the com­pany and re­cover any prop­erty that has been im­prop­erly dis­si­pated be­fore the wind­ing up, the step-fam­ily said.</p>
    <p>It con­tended that Mr Mus­taq’s var­i­ous wrong­do­ings have caused an “ir­re­triev­able break­down” in the re­la­tion­ship among the share­hold­ers.</p>
    <p>Se­nior Coun­sel Davin­der Singh, rep­re­sent­ing the step-fam­ily, said in his open­ing state­ment that Mr Mus­taq “treated the com­pany as his own do­main, abus­ing his po­si­tion with the help of other share­hold­ers and di­rec­tors and help­ing him­self to shares and monies which were not his”.</p>
    <p>He ac­cused Mr Mus­taq of “covertly” di­lut­ing the stake that his fa­ther, Haji Mohamed Mustafa, held in the com­pany in 1995.</p>
    <p>Af­ter Mr Mustafa’s death in 2001, his es­tate’s share­hold­ing was again</p>
    <p>di­luted, to 14.89 per cent, while Mr Mus­taq and his wife’s stake was in­creased to 69.99 per cent, said Mr Singh.</p>
    <p>Mr Singh con­tended that from 2000 to 2013, the com­pany’s av­er­age net profit for each year was about $9.6 mil­lion, but no div­i­dends were de­clared dur­ing that pe­riod.</p>
    <p>How­ever, in that pe­riod, Mr Mus­taq re­ceived be­tween $3 mil­lion and $5 mil­lion an­nu­ally in di­rec­tors’ fees, while his wife re­ceived be­tween $200,000 and $400,000.</p>
    <p>Mr Singh said his clients started dis­cov­er­ing the wrong­do­ings be­tween 2013 and 2016, and af­ter they be­gan ask­ing ques­tions, Mr Mus­taq sud­denly got the com­pany to pay div­i­dends af­ter not do­ing so for 14 years.</p>
    <p>The div­i­dends stopped in Jan­uary 2018 af­ter the step-fam­ily filed its law­suit in De­cem­ber 2017, al­leg­ing mi­nor­ity op­pres­sion, he said.</p>
    <p>Mr Singh also ac­cused Mr Mus­taq of car­ry­ing out sham trans­ac­tions to siphon money from MMSC and col­lect­ing “cash­backs” from em­ploy­ees af­ter mak­ing them over­state their salaries in work pass ap­pli­ca­tions.</p>
    <p>The two sons of Mr Sam­sud­din Mokhtar Ah­mad, Mr Mustafa’s busi­ness part­ner, have also filed a law­suit mak­ing sim­i­lar claims.</p>
    <p>They are rep­re­sented by Mr Sar­b­jit Singh Cho­pra. Both suits are be­ing heard to­gether.</p>
    <p>In his defence, Mr Mus­taq said that he was the sole owner of the com­pany and was en­ti­tled to con­duct its af­fairs as he saw fit.</p>
    <p>His lawyer, Se­nior Coun­sel Alvin Yeo, said Mr Mus­taq grew the busi</p>
    <p>ness through 50 years of hard work, and that Mr Mustafa and Mr Sam­sud­din did not have any say in how the busi­ness was run.</p>
    <p>Mr Yeo said that Mr Mus­taq was 12 years old in 1963 when he started sell­ing handkerchi­efs and socks at a makeshift stall.</p>
    <p>His busi­ness grew, and in 1971, he leased a shop­house in Camp­bell Lane and reg­is­tered a sole pro­pri­etor­ship.</p>
    <p>He said that in July 1973, when Mr Mus­taq made a trip to In­dia to visit his wife and son, Mr Mustafa and Mr Sam­sud­din reg­is­tered the busi­ness un­der the name Mohamed Mustafa and Sam­sud­din Com­pany.</p>
    <p>When Mr Mus­taq re­turned later that year, he con­fronted them about this, but af­ter be­ing as­sured that the busi­ness was his alone, he de­cided to keep the name and added him­self as a part­ner.</p>
    <p>Mr Yeo said it was dis­ap­point­ing that the plain­tiffs have “turned around to bite the hand that feeds them” af­ter ben­e­fit­ing from Mr Mus­taq’s kind­ness and gen­eros­ity through the years.</p>
    <p>He said it was only years af­ter Mr Mustafa and Mr Sam­sud­din died that their fam­ily mem­bers, “armed with a mis­guided sense of self-en­ti­tle­ment”, came to court to ask for more money.</p>
    <p>He said the plain­tiffs have sought to re­write the history of the com­pany, down­played Mr Mus­taq’s con­tri­bu­tions and “con­jured up se­ri­ous and grave al­le­ga­tions for which they have of­fered lit­tle cred­i­ble or no ev­i­dence”.</p>
    <p>The al­le­ga­tions came at the start of a 34-day hear­ing into a suit brought against Mr Mus­taq Ah­mad and his fam­ily by his five step-sib­lings and their mother, with each side ac­cus­ing the other of “in­sa­tiable” greed.</p>
