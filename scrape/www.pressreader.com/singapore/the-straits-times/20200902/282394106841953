    <p>Swiss com­puter pe­riph­eral maker Log­itech has re­freshed its muchloved MX Keys key­board and MX Mas­ter 3 mouse for Mac users.</p>
    <p>The MX Keys for Mac and the MX Mas­ter 3 for Mac have been given a sub­tle paint job makeover to dif­fer­en­ti­ate them from the orig­i­nal ver­sions, which come in grey.</p>
    <p>The new black and sil­ver fin­ish matches Ap­ple’s space grey-hued de­vices, such as the iMac and MacBook Pro.</p>
    <p>Both key­board and mouse have the USB-C-to-USB-C charg­ing ca­ble, in­stead of the USB-A-to-USB-C charg­ing ca­ble found in the nor­mal edi­tions – con­ve­nient for those us­ing MacBook Pro with only USB-C ports.</p>
    <p>Apart from these changes, both pe­riph­er­als are pretty much the same key­board and mouse as the nor­mal edi­tions in func­tion and de­sign.</p>
    <p>The MX Mas­ter 3 for Mac has an er­gonomic shape and a large thumb rest, al­low­ing your right hand to rest com­fort­ably on it.</p>
    <p>It has eight but­tons. Two click but­tons, a scroll wheel and a Mode shift but­ton are on its top, while the back and for­ward but­tons, thumb rest (which is also a ges­ture but­ton) and a thumb-scroll wheel (su­perb for hor­i­zon­tal scrolling or quick change of browser tabs) are on its left.</p>
    <p>The mouse uses a 4,000 dots-per­inch laser sen­sor, said to al­low it to work on any sur­face in­clud­ing glass. It works per­fectly on my din­ing ta­ble’s black glass top.</p>
    <p>This mouse con­tin­ues to be the best work mouse in the mar­ket and a must-have for Mac users.</p>
    <p>Com­pared with the mouse, the MX Keys for Mac dif­fers more from the nor­mal edi­tion. For a start, the key­caps have been changed to suit the macOS ecosys­tem. For in­stance, the op­tion and com­mand keys work iden­ti­cally as the same keys on a Mac key­board, with­out need­ing to be cus­tomised as is the case when you use a Win­dows key­board on a Mac.</p>
    <p>On the top row of the key­board is a full ar­ray of keys for func­tions such as screen bright­ness, app view and me­dia con­trols – sim­i­lar to the Ap­ple Magic Key­board. There are also ad­di­tional ded­i­cated keys for cal­cu­la­tor, screen­shot, look up and lock­ing.</p>
    <p>The smart back­light­ing fea­ture slowly switches on when your hands are above the key­board. It also ad­justs to am­bi­ent light­ing con­di­tions, in­creas­ing its bright­ness in dim con­di­tions.</p>
    <p>I wish the key­board uses alu­minium rather than its sil­ver plas­tic ma­te­rial. And I would like the ad­di­tion of ad­justable feet that can tilt the key­board up to 12 de­grees, from its cur­rent fixed six-de­gree tilt.</p>
    <p>Bat­tery life for the mouse, rated at 70 days a charge, is su­perb. Af­ter two weeks of seven to eight hours of daily use, the four-bar bat­tery in­di­ca­tor in its soft­ware is still full. How­ever, bat­tery life for the key­board – rated at 10 days (with back­light­ing turned on) a charge – drops to just one bar af­ter a week of use.</p>
    <p>Both the key­board and mouse are quite ex­pen­sive at $169 each. How­ever, they of­fer bet­ter value than Ap­ple’s equiv­a­lent pe­riph­er­als. Ap­ple’s Magic Key­board with Nu­meric Key­pad costs up to $199 while the Magic Mouse 2 costs up to $129.</p>
