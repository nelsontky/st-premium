    <p>Three float­ing fa­cil­i­ties at the Tan­jong Pa­gar Ter­mi­nal, that pre­vi­ously used to house for­eign work­ers, will be con­verted into a cen­tre to house sea­far­ers, such as crew in be­tween ship trans­fers, from Tues­day.</p>
    <p>The Mar­itime and Port Au­thor­ity of Sin­ga­pore (MPA) said yes­ter­day that the new crew fa­cil­i­ta­tion cen­tre, which is equipped with an on­site med­i­cal cen­tre, along with test­ing and hold­ing fa­cil­i­ties, will al­low for more crew changes to take place lo­cally, while en­sur­ing that the ships and lo­cal com­mu­ni­ties are kept safe.</p>
    <p>The cen­tre is ded­i­cated to house crew for up to 48 hours be­fore they board their ships, in case their ship and flight sched­ules are mis­matched and they need a place to stay.</p>
    <p>Crew who are due to de­part Sin­ga­pore will be housed in ex­ist­ing des­ig­nated hold­ing fa­cil­i­ties at Seacare Ho­tel and the Posh Bawean ac­com­mo­da­tion ves­sel, with the same 48-hour re­stric­tion.</p>
    <p>Said Trans­port Min­is­ter Ong Ye Kung: “As ship­ping is a global busi­ness, we hope that more ports and stake­hold­ers will join us in such ini­tia­tives so that sea­far­ers can con­tinue their work and keep the sup­ply lines of the world open.”</p>
    <p>To tackle chal­lenges faced by those in the ship­ping in­dus­try, crew-chang­ing pro­ce­dures have been stream­lined – for ex­am­ple, the du­ra­tion of stay-home no­tices (SHN) has been halved to seven days for crew mem­bers com­ing into Sin­ga­pore from iden­ti­fied low-risk coun­tries, pro­vided they have been stay­ing there for at least 14 days.</p>
    <p>Those who have stayed in Brunei and New Zealand for at least 14 days will no longer be re­quired to serve SHN be­fore their ar­rival here.</p>
    <p>How­ever, crew mem­bers must first un­dergo a Covid-19 poly­merase chain re­ac­tion test at ap­proved test­ing fa­cil­i­ties be­fore their de­par­ture for Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>To fur­ther en­sure safe port op­er­a­tions lo­cally, MPA also stip­u­lated that ships need­ing, for ex­am­ple, re­pairs and inspection must in­form the Port Mas­ter at least three days be­fore the ship’s ar­rival as shore per­son­nel will be needed to board the ship.</p>
    <p>As Sin­ga­pore re­mains an im­por­tant global hub port, the MPA, Sin­ga­pore Ship­ping As­so­ci­a­tion, Sin­ga­pore Mar­itime Of­fi­cers’ Union, and Sin­ga­pore Or­gan­i­sa­tion of Sea­men will es­tab­lish a $1 mil­lion fund to prop­a­gate best prac­tices for safe crew changes, said MPA in a me­dia state­ment. The fund, known as the Sin­ga­pore Ship­ping Tri­par­tite Al­liance Re­silience (SG-Star) Fund, will be used to col­lab­o­rate with stake­hold­ers in sea­far­ing na­tions to come up with con­crete so­lu­tions for safe crew changes.</p>
    <p>Ms Mary Liew, gen­eral sec­re­tary of the Sin­ga­pore Mar­itime Of­fi­cers’ Union, said the ef­fort “will as­sist more sea­far­ers to be re­united with their fam­i­lies back home and at the same time, al­low fresh crew to sign on safely so as to pro­vide for their fam­i­lies”.</p>
    <p>Though more ac­com­mo­da­tion for sea­far­ers will be a boon for those in the ship­ping in­dus­try, ship­ping agents still hope for longer stays at th­ese hold­ing fa­cil­i­ties, and more af­ford­able ac­com­mo­da­tion for their crew mem­bers.</p>
    <p>Cap­tain Philip Tay, chief ex­ec­u­tive of­fi­cer of Apex Ship Man­age­ment, felt that the crew mem­bers’ length of stay should be ex­tended be­yond 48 hours, which will al­low for more lee­way in co­or­di­nat­ing and ar­rang­ing crew changes.</p>
