    <p>Did Sin­ga­pore just miss a golden op­por­tu­nity to get its clean­ing act to­gether?</p>
    <p>I fear we might have.</p>
    <p>When the Covid-19 pan­demic struck, it was the per­fect time to get ev­ery­one think­ing and act­ing on per­sonal and pub­lic hy­giene.</p>
    <p>Sud­denly, it be­came a mat­ter of life and death to wear a mask, wash your hands and keep your sur­round­ings clean.</p>
    <p>Ev­ery­where you went, clean­ers were busy mop­ping the floors, wip­ing down ta­bles and chairs, and bus and MRT seats. Even lift but­tons were not spared the sani­tis­ing treat­ment.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore was never cleaner.</p>
    <p>But more im­por­tant, the mes­sage ap­peared to have got through to most peo­ple that you do your bit to keep Sin­ga­pore clean and germ-free not just to pro­tect your own health but ev­ery­one else’s too.</p>
    <p>That is why you wear a mask, not just to stop the virus from harm­ing you but also to pre­vent you from spread­ing it if you were in­fected.</p>
    <p>The pan­demic brought home this sim­ple truth that what we do as in­di­vid­u­als has a pro­found im­pact on other peo­ple, in­clud­ing whether they live or die.</p>
    <p>If ever there was a per­fect time to nail the Keep Sin­ga­pore Clean motto, this was it.</p>
    <p>Alas, the moment was not seized and I fear the mo­men­tum has been lost. With the re­lax­ation of</p>
    <p>Covid-19 mea­sures, there is no longer the same height­ened sen­si­tiv­ity to main­tain per­sonal and pub­lic hy­giene stan­dards.</p>
    <p>You only have to look at what hap­pened to the state of pub­lic clean­li­ness dur­ing the tra­di­tional Hun­gry Ghost pe­riod.</p>
    <p>For about four weeks ev­ery year, parts of the coun­try re­sem­ble a gi­ant, smok­ing in­cense caul­dron, with the burn­ing of joss sticks, can­dles and pa­per para­pher­na­lia in pub­lic, on road­side kerbs, grass patches, be­side open drains, and any­where the be­liev­ers see fit, apart from the des­ig­nated pits pro­vided.</p>
    <p>No one both­ers to clean up the place after these re­li­gious acts, and so the left­over of­fer­ings which some­times in­clude food are strewn all over the place, adding to the filth and lit­ter that clean­ers have to clear up later.</p>
    <p>There was even a video which went vi­ral of a car with its back bumper in flames from burn­ing can­dles placed at an open-air carpark. The un­sus­pect­ing driver had re­versed his car into the spot, not know­ing the park­ing space had been con­verted by some­one into a meet­ing place with the spir­its.</p>
    <p>In a pre-Covid-19 world, most of us put up with this yearly af­fair, even though I sus­pect many Sin­ga­pore­ans would rather not.</p>
    <p>In mul­tira­cial, multi-re­li­gious Sin­ga­pore, it seems bad form to crit­i­cise an­other re­li­gion’s prac­tice, and so we live and let live.</p>
    <p>But a line should be drawn when the ac­tions of a group en­dan­ger pub­lic health and clean­li­ness in a Covid-19 world</p>
    <p>An­other ex­am­ple of bad so­cial be­hav­iour which the pan­demic has not re­versed: re­turn­ing food trays, plates and what­ever that is left after you have fin­ished your meal so the ta­ble is cleared for the next pa­tron.</p>
    <p>This isn’t just a tray-re­turn prob­lem but a wider is­sue of mak­ing Sin­ga­pore­ans re­spon­si­ble for keep­ing their en­vi­ron­ment safe and healthy.</p>
    <p>As a reader of this news­pa­per, Mr Ang Tun Lung, noted in a letter last month: “The ap­palling state of our hawker cen­tres leaves much to be de­sired.</p>
    <p>“Scavengers like pi­geons fly in quickly to feed on the left­overs, and flocks are seen on the ta­bles while other pa­trons are con­sum­ing their meals nearby.”</p>
    <p>He was de­scrib­ing a sight fa­mil­iar to those who pa­tro­n­ise hawker cen­tres, and like the prob­lem with the Hun­gry Ghost Fes­ti­val, most peo­ple put up with it and just look away.</p>
    <p>But this is pre­cisely the is­sue: When a small prob­lem is left unat­tended, it be­comes part of the ac­cept­able norm and very quickly the prac­tice spreads and gets out of hand.</p>
    <p>So­cial sci­en­tists call this the bro­ken win­dow the­ory: If a win­dow in a build­ing is bro­ken and left un­re­paired, all the other win­dows will soon be bro­ken too.</p>
    <p>As the authors of the the­ory wrote in 1982: “An un­re­paired bro­ken win­dow is a sig­nal that no one cares, and so break­ing more win­dows costs noth­ing.”</p>
    <p>Think of dirty hawker cen­tres as bro­ken win­dows in the fight to keep Sin­ga­pore clean and safe.</p>
    <p>Un­cleared ta­bles with birds pick­ing on left­over food is a sig­nal that no one re­ally cares about pub­lic hy­giene and clean­li­ness in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>It does not mat­ter if you do a whole list of other things and spend large sums of money to clean up the coun­try.</p>
    <p>When the Gov­ern­ment an­nounced that it was step­ping up its ef­forts to do this, as part of the fight against this and fu­ture pan­demics, I thought it was ab­so­lutely the right move, and about time.</p>
    <p>From re­ports on the pro­posed new laws which will be in­tro­duced in Par­lia­ment this month, the changes in­clude manda­tory clean­ing stan­dards, spec­i­fy­ing fre­quency of clean­ing, and plac­ing greater ac­count­abil­ity on own­ers of premises.</p>
    <p>All of these re­quire­ments may help, but they will not be enough if there are other ar­eas where noth­ing has changed.</p>
    <p>In­cul­cat­ing a sense of civic re­spon­si­bil­ity to­wards pub­lic hy­giene and clean­li­ness is an all or noth­ing ef­fort – like wear­ing masks where no one is al­lowed to do oth­er­wise.</p>
    <p>There has to be a zero-tol­er­ance mind­set.</p>
    <p>On tray re­turn, for ex­am­ple, it isn’t sur­pris­ing that after so many years with nu­mer­ous cam­paigns, 36 per cent of peo­ple sur­veyed said they were un­sure if trays should be re­turned.</p>
    <p>When they see with their own eyes so many un­cleared ta­bles at hawker cen­tres, how can they not come to the con­clu­sion that it is not nec­es­sary?</p>
    <p>How to achieve a change in pub­lic at­ti­tude on this?</p>
    <p>There have been many sug­ges­tions, some of which have been tried, in­clud­ing mone­tary in­cen­tives for those who re­turn their trays.</p>
    <p>My sug­ges­tion: Do not fo­cus overly on what the right so­lu­tions are, which is what the au­thor­i­ties have been do­ing.</p>
    <p>In­stead, adopt the at­ti­tude that what­ever meth­ods are used you have to make sure that ev­ery ta­ble will be cleared be­cause one un­cleared ta­ble will lead to many more such ta­bles.</p>
    <p>You have to adopt the same ap­proach to the burn­ing of joss sticks in pub­lic.</p>
    <p>In fact, the two are in­ex­tri­ca­bly linked and the more in­stances you have of unat­tended joss sticks lit­ter­ing pub­lic places, the more ta­bles will be left un­cleared.</p>
    <p>Ev­ery anti-so­cial and ir­re­spon­si­ble act vis­i­ble to the pub­lic sends the sig­nal that we are not se­ri­ous about pub­lic hy­giene and clean­li­ness, and this will lead to sim­i­lar be­hav­iour, else­where and ev­ery­where.</p>
    <p>When you adopt a zero-tol­er­ance ap­proach, the prob­lem will look com­pletely dif­fer­ent, and the right so­lu­tions will even­tu­ally be found.</p>
    <p>The pan­demic was the moment to make this com­mit­ment.</p>
    <p>I hope it is not too late.</p>
