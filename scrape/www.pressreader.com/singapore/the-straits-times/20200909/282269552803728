    <p>•</p>
    <p>NEW YORK No­vak Djokovic has pleaded for com­pas­sion for the line judge he in­ad­ver­tently struck in the throat with a ball at the US Open on Mon­day.</p>
    <p>The Serb was dis­qual­i­fied in the fourth round af­ter he hit a ball to the back of the court in frus­tra­tion af­ter drop­ping serve in the first set against Spa­niard Pablo Car­reno Busta, send­ing the of­fi­cial to the floor.</p>
    <p>As she screamed out in pain, a hor­ri­fied Djokovic went over to her and apol­o­gised.</p>
    <p>A tour­na­ment spokesman later said the line judge was okay and was not brought off-site, but that did not ab­solve Djokovic, with the 33-year-old re­ceiv­ing the harsh­est pun­ish­ment pos­si­ble.</p>
    <p>He was fined US$10,000 (S$13,700) on top of be­ing asked to for­feit US$250,000 in prize money af­ter be­ing dis­qual­i­fied from the hard-court Grand Slam for un­sports­man­like con­duct.</p>
    <p>The fe­male of­fi­cial has, how­ever, since faced a back­lash on so­cial me­dia, with some fans of the world No. 1 leav­ing abu­sive com­ments af­ter her In­sta­gram user­name was car­ried by Ser­bian me­dia.</p>
    <p>“Shame on you. Old lady full of evil,” read one of the mes­sages, while other users ac­cused her of fak­ing the in­jury, tak­ing a dive and “bad act­ing”.</p>
    <p>The Daily Mail also said that some even mocked the death of her son.</p>
    <p>Djokovic yes­ter­day de­fended the of­fi­cial on Twit­ter, while thank­ing fans who had left him pos­i­tive mes­sages of sup­port.</p>
    <p>“Please also re­mem­ber the lines­per­son that was hit by the ball last night needs our com­mu­nity’s sup­port too. She’s done noth­ing wrong at all,” the 17-time Grand Slam win­ner said. “I ask you to stay es­pe­cially sup­port­ive and car­ing to her dur­ing this time.</p>
    <p>“From th­ese mo­ments, we grow stronger and we rise above. Shar­ing love with ev­ery­one.”</p>
    <p>Bri­tain’s Tim Hen­man, who suf­fered a sim­i­lar fate in 1995 at Wim­ble­don, feels that the Aus­tralian Open cham­pion would learn from the ex­pe­ri­ence.</p>
    <p>“Djokovic has had plenty of ex­am­ples in the past where he has cut it pretty fine on the court,” the for­mer world No. 4 told The Times of London.</p>
    <p>“Un­for­tu­nately for him, he has got it wrong this time and suf­fered the harsh­est penalty. I think he will take this on board be­cause he is a bright in­di­vid­ual.</p>
    <p>“Go­ing for­ward, he won’t be hit­ting balls and throw­ing his racket be­cause he knows what the re­ac­tion will be.”</p>
