    <p>Com­pa­nies in Sin­ga­pore are less pes­simistic about busi­ness for the next six months, with those in ser­vices reg­is­ter­ing a sharp im­prove­ment in out­look with the eas­ing of Covid-19 curbs on travel and gath­er­ings, as well as the prospect of yearend hol­i­days and the fes­tive sea­son.</p>
    <p>The lat­est sen­ti­ments were cap­tured in sep­a­rate sur­veys re­leased yes­ter­day by the Depart­ment of Statis­tics (SingS­tat) and the Eco­nomic Devel­op­ment Board (EDB).</p>
    <p>In the ser­vices sec­tor, a net weighted bal­ance of 5 per cent of firms polled pre­dicted slower busi­ness for the six months from this month to March. Though the over­all out­look stayed neg­a­tive, this was a big step up from the net weighted bal­ance of 31 per cent which saw weaker prospects in SingS­tat’s sur­vey for the pre­vi­ous quar­ter.</p>
    <p>For man­u­fac­tur­ing, a net weighted bal­ance of 3 per cent of firms pre­dicted less favourable busi­ness con­di­tions, due to un­cer­tainty over the Covid-19 out­break and global econ­omy and United States-China ten­sions, the EDB sur­vey showed. This level, how­ever, was bet­ter than the 7 per cent that did so in the pre­vi­ous quar­terly sur­vey.</p>
    <p>Within the ser­vices sec­tor, sev­eral in­dus­tries ex­pect con­di­tions to im­prove such as the recre­ation, com­mu­nity and per­sonal ser­vices; food and bev­er­age ser­vices; re­tail trade; and in­for­ma­tion and com­mu­ni­ca­tions in­dus­tries. Con­versely, those in ac­com­mo­da­tion, real es­tate and busi­ness ser­vices in­dus­tries re­mained down­beat.</p>
    <p>In terms of jobs, the ser­vices sec­tor ex­pects the over­all em­ploy­ment level to drop in the fourth quar­ter of this year. The food and bev­er­age ser­vices and re­tail trade in­dus­tries ex­pect to hire more for the rest of the year, an­tic­i­pat­ing in­creased de­mand in the up­com­ing year-end hol­i­days and fes­tive sea­son.</p>
    <p>How­ever, firms in the ac­com­mo­da­tion and trans­port and stor­age in­dus­tries ex­pect less hir­ing in the fourth quar­ter. Ho­tels and air trans­port firms ex­pect slow pick-up in de­mand for their ser­vices due to global travel curbs that re­main.</p>
    <p>Among man­u­fac­tur­ers, a net weighted bal­ance of 8 per cent of man­u­fac­tur­ers plan to hire fewer work­ers in the next three months. All man­u­fac­tur­ing clus­ters, ex­cept elec­tron­ics and biomed­i­cal, have pro­jected a smaller work­force for the fourth quar­ter.</p>
    <p>Within the man­u­fac­tur­ing sec­tor, a net weighted bal­ance of 12 per cent of firms in the gen­eral man­u­fac­tur­ing clus­ter an­tic­i­pate busi­ness con­di­tions to pick up. The pos­i­tive sen­ti­ment is led by the mis­cel­la­neous in­dus­tries seg­ment, which ex­pects higher de­mand for con­struc­tion-re­lated ma­te­ri­als as more lo­cal con­struc­tion ac­tiv­i­ties have slowly restarted.</p>
    <p>A net weighted bal­ance of 9 per cent of firms in biomed­i­cal man­u­fac­tur­ing are up­beat. They are led by the med­i­cal tech­nol­ogy seg­ment, which ex­pects ex­port or­ders to in­crease.</p>
    <p>In trans­port engi­neer­ing, a net weighted bal­ance of 4 per cent of firms ex­pect bet­ter prospects. The land seg­ment sees higher ex­port de­mand for car parts, while the marine and off­shore engi­neer­ing seg­ment ex­pects more for­eign work­ers liv­ing in dor­mi­to­ries to re­turn to work, even as the global oil and gas mar­ket re­mains in the dol­drums.</p>
    <p>In elec­tron­ics, 16 per cent of firms are down­beat. Within the clus­ter, semi­con­duc­tor firms an­tic­i­pate sea­son­ally weaker chip de­mand in the next six months, and ex­press cau­tion over el­e­vated risks such as Covid-19 and US-China ten­sions. In con­trast, the other elec­tronic mo­d­ules and com­po­nents seg­ment ex­pects more or­ders from the 5G mar­ket in the months ahead.</p>
    <p>In terms of jobs, the ser­vices sec­tor ex­pects the over­all em­ploy­ment level to drop in the fourth quar­ter of this year. The food and bev­er­age ser­vices and re­tail trade in­dus­tries ex­pect to hire more for the rest of the year, an­tic­i­pat­ing in­creased de­mand in the up­com­ing year-end hol­i­days and fes­tive sea­son.</p>
