    <p>HONG KONG • Mom-and-pop in­vestors who put in bids worth a record US$3 tril­lion (S$4.1 tril­lion) in China’s Ant Group were stunned after reg­u­la­tors abruptly suspended what would have been the world’s largest stock mar­ket de­but.</p>
    <p>China blocked the fin­tech giant’s US$37 bil­lion list­ing on Tues­day, thwart­ing its de­but in Hong Kong and Shang­hai and deal­ing a blow to the com­pany founded by Alibaba’s bil­lion­aire co-founder Jack Ma.</p>
    <p>Re­tail in­vestors in the two mar­kets – from taxi driv­ers to stu­dents to young pro­fes­sion­als – used their sav­ings and bor­rowed heav­ily from banks and bro­ker­ages for what many saw as a once-in-a-life­time in­vest­ment op­por­tu­nity.</p>
    <p>“I feel like I made a very wrong de­ci­sion,” said 21-year-old Hong Kong res­i­dent and Cam­bridge stu­dent Vin­cent Tse, who ap­plied for 2,000 shares worth around HK$160,000 (S$28,000), a sum he earned do­ing a part-time job.</p>
    <p>“This sit­u­a­tion re­ally re­veals a deep prob­lem in the Chi­nese mar­ket and shows a lack of ex­pe­ri­ence in hold­ing such a large (ini­tial public of­fer­ing),” he said, adding that he will no longer in­vest in Ant and will in­stead rein­vest in US, Euro­pean or Ja­panese stock mar­kets.</p>
    <p>In China, in­vestors cited the chang­ing busi­ness en­vi­ron­ment as a key fac­tor weigh­ing on Ant’s fu­ture developmen­t, with some say­ing that they would still be keen to in­vest.</p>
    <p>“I’d prob­a­bly in­vest again just be­cause of the sheer size of the mar­ket share Ant Fi­nan­cial has,” said a 21-year-old stu­dent in­vestor in Bei­jing who goes by the name Cle­men­tine.</p>
    <p>The un­prece­dented re­tail frenzy for Ant’s shares was backed by a mas­sive amount of mar­gin lend­ing by fi­nan­cial in­sti­tu­tions in main­land China and in Hong Kong, with bro­ker­ages in Hong Kong lend­ing bil­lions of dol­lars.</p>
    <p>Some banks in Hong Kong of­fered as much as 30 times lever­age at in­ter­est rates of be­tween 0.4 per cent and 0.5 per cent for a pe­riod of around 10 days, bank­ing in­dus­try sources have said.</p>
    <p>Ant said yes­ter­day that it would re­fund the ap­pli­ca­tion money for the Hong Kong leg of the of­fer­ing with­out in­ter­est over the next few days. Sev­eral Hong Kong bro­kers said they would waive han­dling fees and in­ter­est rates on mar­gin loans for in­vestors who had sub­scribed for Ant shares.</p>
    <p>Ma­jor len­ders HSBC and BOC Hong Kong Hold­ings did not com­ment. The bro­ker­ages in­cluded Ten­cent-backed Futu and Bright Smart Se­cu­ri­ties, an es­tab­lished bro­ker that lent HK$47 bil­lion on mar­gin.</p>
    <p>Mr Billy Ng, a prop­erty man­ager in his 40s, sub­scribed for 20,000 shares on mar­gin fi­nanc­ing. As his bank of­fered a low in­ter­est of 0.48 per cent, he had to pay only HK$1,400 in in­ter­est ver­sus around HK$6,000 nor­mally.</p>
    <p>“It’s a joke on the Chi­nese stock ex­change. If Ant lists again, I’m not sure I’ll sub­scribe again,” said a 37-year-old sec­re­tary, adding that she had been al­lot­ted 50 of the 350 shares that she ap­plied for.</p>
