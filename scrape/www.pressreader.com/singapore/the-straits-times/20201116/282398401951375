    <p>Hyflux, in its third year of a debt re­struc­tur­ing process, said it is sup­port­ing a plan pro­posed by Amer­i­can fund man­ager Strate­gic Growth In­vest­ments (SGI) to ac­quire and pri­va­tise it in a deal that would in­clude a cash in­jec­tion of $208 mil­lion.</p>
    <p>The debt-rid­den wa­ter treat­ment com­pany will work with SGI to “fa­cil­i­tate the adop­tion and im­ple­men­ta­tion of this pro­posal by the var­i­ous stake­hold­ers on a timely ba­sis”, Mr Lau Wing Tat, a Hyflux di­rec­tor, said in a fil­ing to the Sin­ga­pore Ex­change last Friday.</p>
    <p>In a term sheet that was part of the stock ex­change fil­ing, SGI pledged an “aug­men­ta­tion of ex­ec­u­tive lead­er­ship”, and said it would re­place Hyflux’s board of di­rec­tors en­tirely. Chief ex­ec­u­tive of­fi­cer Olivia Lum would be­come non-ex­ec­u­tive chair of the ad­vi­sory board.</p>
    <p>Hyflux’s debt in­cludes bank loans and bonds held by 34,000 re­tail in­vestors. De­spite be­ing ap­proached by mul­ti­ple suit­ors, it has failed to reach a deal and had sought sev­eral ex­ten­sions on its debt mora­to­rium.</p>
    <p>Hyflux is fac­ing claims to­talling about $2.79 bil­lion, some $1.03 bil­lion of which is from hold­ers of its per­pet­ual se­cu­ri­ties and pref­er­ence shares (PnP), the SGI term sheet showed. Banks are owed $630.7 mil­lion, ac­cord­ing to the doc­u­ment.</p>
    <p>Of the $208 mil­lion, PnP hold­ers will get $41.3 mil­lion; medi­umterm note hold­ers, $26.2 mil­lion; banks and fa­cil­i­ties, $56.8 mil­lion; other cred­i­tors, $14.8 mil­lion; con­tin­gent claimants, $53 mil­lion; while trade cred­i­tors will get $15.8 mil­lion.</p>
    <p>The Se­cu­ri­ties In­vestors As­so­ci­a­tion (Sin­ga­pore), or Sias, said in re­sponse to the new deal that it is ready to work with all in­vestors to sup­port the PnP hold­ers.</p>
    <p>“Al­though the SGI term sheet is non-bind­ing and con­di­tional, it con­tains a pro­posal to re­solve the debts due to all stake­holder groups, in­clud­ing the PnP hold­ers,” said Sias pres­i­dent and chief ex­ec­u­tive David Ger­ald.</p>
    <p>He noted that the cash pay­out equates to a 4 per cent re­cov­ery for the PnP hold­ers.</p>
    <p>The term sheet is valid for 60 days upon which time a bind­ing let­ter of in­tent shall be is­sued and signed by all re­lated par­ties. SGI aims to close the deal within 60 days of the ex­e­cu­tion of the let­ter of in­tent, it said.</p>
    <p>SGI will ter­mi­nate t he deal should Hyflux go into ju­di­cial man­age­ment, mainly be­cause that would likely re­sult in a pro­longed process, Mr Michael Hong, chief in­vest­ment of­fi­cer of the US firm, said in a let­ter to Ms Lum.</p>
    <p>The High Court on Oct 15 warned Hyflux about drag­ging out its re­struc­tur­ing process and said there would be no fur­ther ad­journ­ments on a hear­ing to de­cide whether it should be put un­der ju­di­cial con­trol. The next hear­ing is to­day.</p>
