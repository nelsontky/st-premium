    <p>Health Or­gan­i­sa­tion warned of alarm­ing rates of trans­mis­sion of Covid-19 across Europe. The United States, In­dia and Brazil ac­count for more than half of the world’s cases, with In­dia emerg­ing as the new epi­cen­tre.</p>
    <p>PARIS • The num­ber of coro­n­avirus cases reg­is­tered world­wide topped 30 mil­lion on Thurs­day.</p>
    <p>The grim land­mark came as the World Health Or­gan­i­sa­tion (WHO) warned of alarm­ing rates of trans­mis­sion of Covid-19 across Europe.</p>
    <p>The tal­lies, us­ing data col­lected from the na­tional au­thor­i­ties and in­for­ma­tion from the WHO, prob­a­bly re­flect only a frac­tion of the ac­tual num­ber of in­fec­tions. Many coun­tries are test­ing only symp­to­matic or the most se­ri­ous cases.</p>
    <p>The global coro­n­avirus death toll is now at nearly 950,000, af­ter the virus sur­faced in China late last year, and the num­ber of cases has bal­looned to more than 30 mil­lion, with in­fec­tions show­ing no signs of slow­ing more than six months af­ter the pan­demic was de­clared.</p>
    <p>The United States, In­dia and Brazil ac­count for more than half of the world’s cases, with In­dia emerg­ing as the new epi­cen­tre, re­port­ing nearly 100,000 in­fec­tions a day.</p>
    <p>The US has the high­est na­tional fig­ures, with more than 6.6 mil­lion con­firmed cases and over 197,000 deaths linked to the coro­n­avirus.</p>
    <p>It is fol­lowed by In­dia at about 5.2 mil­lion in­fec­tions and more than 84,000 fa­tal­i­ties, and Brazil with over 4.4 mil­lion cases and about 135,000 deaths.</p>
    <p>It took 94 days for the world to hit a mil­lion con­firmed coro­n­avirus in­fec­tions, and then an­other 86 days for the num­ber of cases to cross 10 mil­lion on June 28.</p>
    <p>The num­ber of in­fec­tions has tre­bled since then.</p>
    <p>The virus is now spread­ing at a rate of one mil­lion cases ev­ery four or five days. From France to South Korea, for­mer hot spots that had brought the virus un­der con­trol are fight­ing fresh out­breaks, com­pli­cat­ing ef­forts to re­open economies.</p>
    <p>Gov­ern­ments, health ex­perts and in­di­vid­u­als are keeping a laser fo­cus on the devel­op­ment of an ef­fec­tive vac­cine to rein in the fast-grow­ing pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Asia has reg­is­tered the most new cases in the past week with more than 740,000 in­fec­tions, of which more than 80 per cent are in In­dia.</p>
    <p>Latin Amer­ica and the Caribbean are next at nearly 500,000, fol­lowed by Europe at more than 320,000, Canada and the US at over 270,000, the Mid­dle East at about 112,000, Africa at around 52,000, and Ocea­nia at more than 500.</p>
    <p>Latin Amer­ica has some 8.4 mil­lion in­fec­tions in all and more than 316,000 deaths, fol­lowed by Asia with over 6.8 mil­lion cases and around 120,000 fa­tal­i­ties.</p>
    <p>Canada and the US have nearly 6.8 mil­lion cases and 206,000 deaths, Europe has 4.7 mil­lion in­fec­tions and 223,000 deaths, and the Mid­dle East has 1.7 mil­lion cases and 41,000 deaths.</p>
    <p>Africa has recorded more than 1.3 mil­lion cases an d 33,000 deaths, fol­lowed by Ocea­nia at nearly 31,000 in­fec­tions and about 900 deaths.</p>
    <p>The num­ber of new cases rose 39 per cent in Bri­tain over the past week, 22 per cent in Canada, 19 per cent in France, 11 per cent in Brazil, 9 per cent in the US and 8 per cent in In­dia.</p>
