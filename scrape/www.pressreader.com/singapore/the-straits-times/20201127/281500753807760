    <p>Sin­ga­pore looks set to emerge from Covid-19 gloom and chalk up a good rate of growth next year, ac­cord­ing to Min­istry of Trade and In­dus­try data on Monday.</p>
    <p>The econ­omy is fore­cast to ex­pand by 4 per cent to 6 per cent next year. Third quar­ter growth was stronger than ex­pected, at 9.2 per cent com­pared with the sec­ond quar­ter – an im­prove­ment from the 13.2 per cent de­cline in the sec­ond quar­ter, when most of­fices and shops were closed due to the cir­cuit breaker lock­down.</p>
    <p>The brighter out­look pro­vides an op­por­tune time for the Repub­lic to pivot its Covid-19 sup­port mea­sures, go­ing be­yond help­ing com­pa­nies keep cur­rent jobs, to a sharper fo­cus on help­ing work­ers and com­pa­nies pre­pare for jobs of the fu­ture.</p>
    <p>Such a pivot would be in line with the rec­om­men­da­tions of the in­terim re­port on the Or­gan­i­sa­tion for Economic Co­op­er­a­tion and De­vel­op­ment’s (OECD) economic out­look re­leased in Septem­ber. This sug­gested that gov­ern­ments sup­port work­ers rather than pro­tect jobs.</p>
    <p>Its re­port noted many gov­ern­ments’ rapid re­sponse to the pan­demic by rolling out job re­ten­tion schemes such as sub­si­dis­ing wages – Sin­ga­pore’s Jobs Sup­port Scheme would fall into this cat­e­gory – but warned about their pro­longed ef­fect.</p>
    <p>“Job re­ten­tion schemes... such as wage sub­si­dies, are ef­fec­tive in pre­serv­ing ex­ist­ing jobs but may hin­der de­sir­able post-cri­sis ad­just­ment across sec­tors... Over time, their fo­cus needs to be ad­justed grad­u­ally to sup­port work­ers rather than jobs.”</p>
    <p>It added: “Fail­ure to do so could hin­der ag­gre­gate pro­duc­tiv­ity and the economic re­cov­ery by trap­ping re­sources in non-pro­duc­tive ‘zom­bie’ firms and jobs, and re­duce the prospects for job switch­ing to more pro­duc­tive and higher-paid po­si­tions.”</p>
    <p>In a blog ac­com­pa­ny­ing the re­port, its chief economist Lau­rence Boone wrote starkly about lessons learnt from the global fi­nan­cial cri­sis. First: It is im­por­tant not to with­draw fis­cal sup­port pre­ma­turely. Sec­ond: “We also learnt that pol­icy can only tem­po­rar­ily pre­vent a rise in bank­rupt­cies and un­em­ploy­ment. Sup­port to firms must evolve to let non-vi­able firms go and en­cour­age vi­able ones to grow.”</p>
    <p>FIRST WAVE RE­SPONSES: SAV­ING JOBS</p>
    <p>In the first wave of pan­demic re­sponses, many gov­ern­ments fo­cused on sav­ing jobs.</p>
    <p>This makes sense as sav­ing jobs pro­tects work­ers’ in­comes and keeps the econ­omy go­ing, which would sus­tain full em­ploy­ment, keep tax cof­fers healthy and re­duce need for wel­fare pay­ments.</p>
    <p>But such schemes are costly. Sin­ga­pore has al­lo­cated $23.5 bil­lion to the Jobs Sup­port Scheme which pays tiered wage sub­si­dies till March next year. Aus­tralia and New Zealand es­ti­mated that their wage sub­sidy schemes run to about 3 per cent of GDP ev­ery three months, ac­cord­ing to an S&P Global Rat­ings re­port.</p>
    <p>There is grow­ing con­sen­sus that govern­ment help needs to pivot from help­ing com­pa­nies save jobs to­day, to help­ing work­ers and com­pa­nies pre­pare for to­mor­row’s jobs. This is be­cause many jobs be­ing lost are gone for good.</p>
    <p>The pan­demic is has­ten­ing struc­tural changes, many al­ready un­der way due to dig­i­tal dis­rup­tion. Some jobs will “sim­ply dis­ap­pear”, as Prime Min­is­ter Lee Hsien Loong warned in his May Day Rally ad­dress this year.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to one es­ti­mate, about 40 per cent of jobs lost in the United States will be gone per­ma­nently.</p>
    <p>Draw­ing on Sur­vey of Busi­ness Un­cer­tainty data from firms, re­searchers at the Univer­sity of Chicago’s Becker Fried­man</p>
    <p>In­sti­tute for Eco­nomics con­structed a for­ward-look­ing model of how jobs and sales will be af­fected. In a work­ing pa­per (No. 2020-59), the re­searchers pre­dict that 32 per cent to 42 per cent of Covid-19-in­duced lay­offs will be per­ma­nent, and that the Covid-19 shock caused three new hires for ev­ery 10 lay­offs.</p>
    <p>In Sin­ga­pore, to­tal em­ploy­ment con­tracted in the third quar­ter of this year (mi­nus 26,900), which is slower than in the pre­vi­ous quar­ter (mi­nus 103,752).</p>
    <p>Many job losses here are in retail, avi­a­tion and tourism-re­lated in­dus­tries. Jobs “dis­ap­pear” when the in­dus­try scales down and fewer peo­ple are needed – for ex­am­ple, with re­duced travel and low tourism, fewer flight at­ten­dants, travel agents, taxi driv­ers, ho­tel staff and retail as­sis­tants are needed.</p>
    <p>Other jobs “dis­ap­pear” when tech­nol­ogy takes over: For ex­am­ple, au­to­mated carpark gantries re­duce the need for carpark at­ten­dants and pro­duc­tiv­ity apps on smart­phones and per­sonal de­vices re­duce the need for sec­re­tar­ial or ad­min­is­tra­tive staff.</p>
    <p>Apart from dis­ap­pear­ing jobs, there are “zom­bie com­pa­nies” – com­pa­nies with low pro­duc­tiv­ity which should shut down in a com­pet­i­tive econ­omy, but hang on with state sup­port or pro­tec­tion.</p>
    <p>As PM Lee said at an Apec CEO Di­a­logues re­cently, gov­ern­ments need to put sup­port on a sus­tain­able ba­sis: “We have to adapt our­selves for what is to come, rather than freeze a po­si­tion which re­flected what was pre-Covid-19. Oth­er­wise, we will end up with zom­bie com­pa­nies and an un­pro­duc­tive econ­omy, and I think that will lead to more trou­ble for us later on.”</p>
    <p>So while com­pa­nies lean on the Jobs Sup­port Scheme now, the truth is that it makes lit­tle sense to pro­tect un­pro­duc­tive jobs or com­pa­nies for too long. In­stead they should be left to at­tri­tion to phase out and make way for new ones.</p>
    <p>But let­ting com­pa­nies fail means many jobs be­ing lost, dis­rupt­ing many fam­i­lies’ lives. This is a hard mes­sage to hear, and yet it is a nec­es­sary one to ac­cept. Work­ers will need to move on to new roles in growth sec­tors.</p>
    <p>PRE­PAR­ING FOR THE NEW JOBS</p>
    <p>There are bright spots amid the grim re­al­i­ties.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore is as­sid­u­ously work­ing to po­si­tion its econ­omy for the post-Covid-19 world and in­vestors are re­spond­ing.</p>
    <p>In the first half of the year, Sin­ga­pore drew $14.3 bil­lion in fixed-as­set in­vest­ments, which is 95 per cent of the $15.2 bil­lion drawn last year.</p>
    <p>The Repub­lic is quick off the mark to ex­plore green travel lanes for busi­ness vis­i­tors. Its air travel bub­ble for leisure vis­i­tors with Hong Kong would have been a trail­blazer, if it were not de­layed for two weeks due to a spate of new Covid-19 in­fec­tions in Hong Kong.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore also aims to be “amongst the leading lights” of cities able to host in­ter­na­tional convention­s, by en­sur­ing the health and safety of vis­i­tors, said Trade and In­dus­try Min­is­ter Chan Chun Sing on Wed­nes­day when he opened Trav­elRe­vive, the first in­ter­na­tional trade show to be held phys­i­cally in the Asia-Pa­cific since the coronaviru­s out­break. Among the 1,000 peo­ple who at­tended the two-day show phys­i­cally were about 65 for­eign del­e­gates from 15 coun­tries.</p>
    <p>And at a time when xeno­pho­bia is ris­ing and many in­dus­tri­alised coun­tries turn in­wards, Sin­ga­pore an­nounced its Tech.Pass pro­gramme to at­tract global tech founders and lead­ers to Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>All these, plus Sin­ga­pore’s abil­ity to con­trol the mas­sive out­breaks in for­eign worker dor­mi­to­ries and the fact that it held an elec­tion in July with­out in­fec­tions get­ting out of con­trol, are bur­nish­ing Sin­ga­pore’s rep­u­ta­tion as a busi­ness-friendly, high­func­tion­ing so­ci­ety with a top-per­form­ing govern­ment.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore’s economic agen­cies are do­ing their best to se­cure the economic fu­ture and lure jobs of the fu­ture to our shores.</p>
    <p>The ques­tion is whether our work­ers are be­ing pre­pared suf­fi­ciently to take up these jobs of the fu­ture. These will in­clude jobs in growth in­dus­tries such as med­i­cal ser­vices, biotech, food pro­duc­tion and de­liv­ery, and in­fo­comm tech­nol­ogy (ICT).</p>
    <p>The lat­est job sit­u­a­tion re­port from the Man­power Min­istry and the In­fo­comm Me­dia</p>
    <p>De­vel­op­ment Author­ity (IMDA) in­di­cate that more than 12,000 jobs are on of­fer in the ICT sec­tor, nearly all for pro­fes­sion­als, man­agers, ex­ec­u­tives and tech­ni­cians (PMETs).</p>
    <p>HELP­ING WORK­ERS WITH TRAN­SI­TION</p>
    <p>How can dis­placed work­ers be best helped to get onto the lad­der for qual­ity jobs – last­ing jobs with good pay? And what can be done to help work­ers pre­pare for new jobs, even while they may be con­tin­u­ing in their cur­rent “zom­bie” roles?</p>
    <p>This is an is­sue that should con­sume the same level of at­ten­tion and re­sources as the on­go­ing race to se­cure new jobs. Help­ing work­ers cope with tran­si­tion is as im­por­tant as scour­ing the world for new in­vest­ments to come to Sin­ga­pore. Such ef­forts also need to be proac­tive and co­or­di­nated.</p>
    <p>Var­i­ous agen­cies of­fer help: Skill­sFu­ture SG un­der the Ed­u­ca­tion Min­istry; Work­force SG un­der the Man­power Min­istry; the labour move­ment’s e2i (Em­ploy­ment and Em­ploy­a­bil­ity In­sti­tute) and train­ing provider NTUC Learn­ing Hub.</p>
    <p>Many pro­grammes ex­ist for dis­placed work­ers – for train­ing, for at­tach­ments, for trainee­ships – but nav­i­gat­ing them is a chal­lenge.</p>
    <p>Just as the Economic De­vel­op­ment Board of­fers for­eign in­vestors a one-stop help cen­tre to en­ter Sin­ga­pore, work­ers anx­ious about their role in a trans­formed econ­omy could do with a one-stop gate­way to start their jour­ney. Given the range of train­ing and job at­tach­ment pro­grammes man­aged by dif­fer­ent agen­cies, a por­tal pow­ered by ar­ti­fi­cial in­tel­li­gence, with a much bet­ter user in­ter­face, is sorely needed.</p>
    <p>An­other area of con­cern is tran­si­tional help for dis­placed work­ers. Many dis­placed work­ers will need fi­nan­cial help af­ter us­ing up their sav­ings, if job­less­ness lasts more than a few months. A slew of Covid-19 sup­port grants are avail­able, most re­quir­ing job search or train­ing ef­forts, which is a sen­si­ble con­di­tion. But even the more gen­er­ous op­tions, such as one of­fer­ing $800 a month for three months, may not cover house­hold ex­penses for the fam­ily.</p>
    <p>Those who want to be reskilled will find their train­ing highly sub­sidised. Some get a salary too.</p>
    <p>The Pro­fes­sional Con­ver­sion Pro­gramme (PCP)matches mid­dle-aged PMETs to com­pa­nies in growth sec­tors like health­care, man­u­fac­tur­ing, data anal­y­sis, pre­ci­sion en­gi­neer­ing and lo­gis­tics. It pays their train­ing costs plus a de­cent salary, of up to sev­eral thou­sand dol­lars a month. Most of this tab is picked up by the Govern­ment. Since 2016, PCPs have ben­e­fited nearly 14,500 Sin­ga­pore­ans. Nine in 10 re­mained em­ployed 24 months af­ter be­ing placed, and seven in 10 earned higher wages af­ter start­ing their new jobs.</p>
    <p>While the PCP of­fers gen­er­ous terms, more typ­i­cal is the SGUnited Mid-Ca­reer Path­ways Pro­gramme, which of­fers sub­sidised train­ing at rep­utable com­pa­nies, and comes with a train­ing al­lowance of $1,500 a month.</p>
    <p>This is a promis­ing ini­tia­tive, but many work­ers’ fam­i­lies will still strug­gle to live on that sum for the en­tire du­ra­tion of train­ing, which lasts six months to a year. Work­ers may refuse train­ing and hold out for a higher-pay­ing job, even if they work in a sun­set sec­tor.</p>
    <p>Their jour­ney can be made less pre­car­i­ous if they and their fam­i­lies have ac­cess to more sub­stan­tive fund­ing dur­ing their tran­si­tion.</p>
    <p>Dis­rup­tion means job changes will be a per­ma­nent fea­ture of the work land­scape. It is dis­ap­point­ing that Sin­ga­pore still lacks a bet­ter sup­port struc­ture for such dis­placed work­ers be­fore they tran­sit to new roles. It should be a pri­or­ity to de­velop this, at a time when job losses are mount­ing, and be­fore more “zom­bie” com­pa­nies fold.</p>
    <p>Un­em­ploy­ment in­sur­ance is of­ten touted as a so­lu­tion, but it car­ries moral haz­ard (em­ploy­ers and work­ers are more ea­ger to trig­ger un­em­ploy­ment if they know they can get gen­er­ous ben­e­fits). One op­tion to con­sider is let­ting work­ers bor­row against their own Cen­tral Prov­i­dent Fund for such mid-term use. (This is just one sug­ges­tion and ob­vi­ously would have to be de­signed care­fully to avoid erod­ing re­tire­ment sav­ings. The point is to ex­plore pos­si­ble so­lu­tions to this press­ing is­sue.)</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore’s ef­forts to po­si­tion its econ­omy to take ad­van­tage of the post-Covid-19 world are high-pro­file and hope­fully high-im­pact. Its ef­forts to get work­ers to be just as ready for the fu­ture must not pale in com­par­i­son.</p>
    <p>Just as the Economic De­vel­op­ment Board of­fers for­eign in­vestors a one-stop help cen­tre to en­ter Sin­ga­pore, work­ers anx­ious about their role in a trans­formed econ­omy could do with a one-stop gate­way to start their jour­ney. Given the range of train­ing and job at­tach­ment pro­grammes man­aged by dif­fer­ent agen­cies, a por­tal pow­ered by ar­ti­fi­cial in­tel­li­gence, with a much bet­ter user in­ter­face, is sorely needed.</p>
    <p>The more Europe gets its act to­gether, the bet­ter. Mr Bi­den will not only be busy deal­ing with the grave di­vi­sions that have emerged within Amer­i­can so­ci­ety. He will have to look in­tensely at China and Asia. Af­ter Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump walked away from the Trans-Pa­cific Part­ner­ship trade deal, he made room for China to fill the void. The at­ten­tion of the US, there­fore, will be con­sumed by an in­creas­ingly dom­i­nant China.</p>
