    <p>Net­ting has been put up along parts of Changi Juras­sic Mile, fol­low­ing an in­ci­dent where a fe­male pedes­trian was hit on the head by a stray golf ball from the ad­ja­cent golf course.</p>
    <p>The Changi Air­port Group (CAG) said in re­sponse to queries yes­ter­day that the net­ting was in­stalled last Satur­day night as a safety mea­sure.</p>
    <p>The net­ting ex­tends ver­ti­cally above fenc­ing that sep­a­rates the walk­ing path from the di­nosaur ex­hibits and the golf course.</p>
    <p>The Changi Juras­sic Mile is part of the Changi Air­port Con­nec­tor, which stretches from East Coast Park to Ter­mi­nal 4 and Ter­mi­nal 2 at Changi Air­port.</p>
    <p>The con­nec­tor runs along­side the Tanah Merah Coun­try Club.</p>
    <p>Pre­vi­ously, Face­book user Derek Yap had shared that his do­mes­tic helper was in­jured as she and his fam­ily were walk­ing along the di­nosaur trail last Thurs­day evening.</p>
    <p>He said his helper was taken to the hospi­tal and was found to have bruis­ing on her head. She was ad­vised to mon­i­tor her con­di­tion at home and was re­ported to be “fine so far”.</p>
    <p>Mr Yap said that he was told by CAG and Tanah Merah Coun­try Club that it was the first time that such an ac­ci­dent had hap­pened.</p>
    <p>Both have since apol­o­gised for the in­ci­dent.</p>
    <p>Mr Yap said he shared the in­ci­dent on­line to raise aware­ness, and en­cour­aged those pass­ing the stretch to hold up open um­brel­las and cy­clists to keep their hel­mets on.</p>
    <p>The coun­try club did not re­spond to The Straits Times’ queries on whether com­pen­sa­tion will be of­fered to the woman who was in­jured and if any­one will be held li­able for the in­ci­dent.</p>
    <p>Sep­a­rately, the CAG said the baby di­nosaur ex­hibit, which was miss­ing five of its front teeth in a re­cent act of van­dal­ism, has been re­paired.</p>
    <p>This was brought to light af­ter a video of a woman rock­ing back and forth on the ex­hibit made its rounds on­line.</p>
    <p>A CAG spokesman said on Oct 17 that the group will be “adding cau­tion­ary signs along Changi Juras­sic Mile to re­mind vis­i­tors not to climb on the ex­hibits” and that there will be sur­veil­lance cam­eras along the path­way.</p>
