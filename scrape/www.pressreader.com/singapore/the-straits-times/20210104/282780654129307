    <p>Gem­ini (May 21 - June 20)</p>
    <p>The chat­ter is hard to cut through. Work with what you have and pay at­ten­tion to any sig­nals that are re­peated in the noise.</p>
    <p>Can­cer (June 21 - July 22)</p>
    <p>Try to clean up around the house or at work – you need or­der be­fore you can make the most of your en­ergy. Once you feel com­fort­able, dive into work.</p>
    <p>Leo (July 23 - Aug 22)</p>
    <p>Keep por­ing over your fi­nan­cial records – you are sure to spot some­thing im­por­tant, such as over­paid taxes or a for­got­ten sav­ings ac­count. Check it out.</p>
    <p>Virgo (Aug 23 - Sept 22)</p>
    <p>A re­quest for as­sis­tance comes in just un­der the wire and might make you sigh – but take care of this quickly. It could spin out of con­trol if left alone.</p>
    <p>Libra (Sept 23 - Oct 22)</p>
    <p>De­tails are over­whelm­ing, so chill out and let oth­ers help. You may find that your en­ergy is bet­ter ex­pended on projects that in­volve the big pic­ture.</p>
    <p>Scor­pio (Oct 23 - Nov 21)</p>
    <p>A friend needs some­thing small from you that means the world to him.</p>
    <p>Give him what­ever is needed as you will be re­paid many times over.</p>
    <p>Sagit­tar­ius (Nov 22 - Dec 21)</p>
    <p>Try not to rush too far ahead – things are com­plex enough al­ready. You may have to get a friend to hold you back as your in­stincts are to keep mov­ing quickly.</p>
    <p>Capri­corn (Dec 22 - Jan 19)</p>
    <p>To­day is all about the tiny de­tails of life – and your men­tal en­ergy helps you em­brace them. Share some of the bur­den with fam­ily or col­leagues.</p>
    <p>Aquar­ius (Jan 20 - Feb 18)</p>
    <p>Busi­ness as­so­ciates are mostly think­ing about them­selves. That does not mean you will be stabbed in the back, just that you have to think of yourself for now.</p>
    <p>Pisces (Feb 19 - March 20)</p>
    <p>This is not a day for deep thought. You might not even be able grasp the es­sen­tials, so do your best and try to fig­ure it out. Get a friend to help.</p>
