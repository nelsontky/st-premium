    <p>Up to $150 mil­lion will be set aside for a pro­gramme that pro­vides men­tor­ship and grants to help start-ups get their in­no­va­tive busi­ness ideas off the ground.</p>
    <p>Deputy Prime Min­is­ter Heng Swee Keat in his min­is­te­rial state­ment yes­ter­day said that he will en­hance the Startup SG Founder pro­gramme in phases, as part of ef­forts to con­tinue to spur in­no­va­tion and en­trepreneur­ship in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>The Govern­ment will raise the start-up cap­i­tal grant and con­tinue to pro­vide men­tor­ship to en­trepreneur­s, sup­port­ing start-ups as they con­trib­ute to eco­nomic growth and the na­tion’s ef­forts against Covid-19, he added.</p>
    <p>The Min­istry of Trade and In­dus­try will pro­vide more details later in the week, said Mr Heng, who is also Finance Min­is­ter.</p>
    <p>The Startup SG Founder pro­gramme cur­rently pro­vides men­tor­ship and a start-up cap­i­tal grant of $30,000 to first-time en­trepreneur­s with in­no­va­tive busi­ness ideas. Start-ups are re­quired to raise and com­mit $10,000 as a co-match­ing fund to the grant.</p>
    <p>In his speech, Mr Heng em­pha­sised the im­por­tance of Sin­ga­pore po­si­tion­ing it­self to seize growth op­por­tu­ni­ties in a post-Covid-19 world and con­tin­u­ing to trans­form its econ­omy, with the pan­demic hav­ing ac­cel­er­ated struc­tural shifts.</p>
    <p>The Repub­lic started its eco­nomic trans­for­ma­tion five years ago, with the devel­op­ment of in­dus­try trans­for­ma­tion maps for 23 sec­tors.</p>
    <p>“Let us build on our head start and con­tinue to pre­pare our work­ers and busi­nesses for the fu­ture,” Mr Heng said.</p>
    <p>He out­lined how it will not be busi­ness as usual af­ter the virus pan­demic, given fac­tors such as the in­ten­si­fi­ca­tion of the United</p>
    <p>States-China strate­gic com­pe­ti­tion with “tremen­dous im­pli­ca­tions on trade, tech­nol­ogy and the global or­der”, and the re­con­fig­u­ra­tion of global sup­ply chains.</p>
    <p>Ac­knowl­edg­ing how the ac­cel­er­ated digital shift has chal­lenged the vi­a­bil­ity of cur­rent busi­ness mod­els and changed jobs, Mr Heng noted the emer­gence of new ar­eas of growth, such as health­care, sustainabi­lity and ar­ti­fi­cial in­tel­li­gence.</p>
    <p>“New jobs are be­ing cre­ated, re­quir­ing new skills and new ways of work­ing,” he said.</p>
    <p>Mr Heng also high­lighted firms which have been able to pivot nim­bly to new op­por­tu­ni­ties dur­ing this Covid-19 cri­sis, lever­ag­ing their prior in­vest­ments in in­no­va­tion. One of them is re­tailer Decks, which re­vamped its web­site and ex­panded to other e-mar­ket­places such as Zalora, Shopee and Lazada dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker pe­riod, which saw its on­line sales in­crease up to 10 times.</p>
    <p>While the re­tail land­scape re­mains soft, Decks is buck­ing the trend and seek­ing to ex­pand its phys­i­cal pres­ence and hire more work­ers, said chief ex­ec­u­tive Kelvyn Chee.</p>
    <p>“Dur­ing this Covid-19 pe­riod, while the sales for some of our fash­ion brands have fallen, the ca­sual wear and home wear brands have per­formed quite well,” Mr Chee said, cit­ing Surfers Paradise as one of its brands which have seen brisk busi­ness with most peo­ple work­ing from home.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, the Emerg­ing Stronger Task­force, which was set up ear­lier this year and co-led by Min­is­ter for Na­tional Devel­op­ment Des­mond Lee and PSA In­ter­na­tional chief ex­ec­u­tive Tan Chong Meng, is in the midst of pro­to­typ­ing new ideas in ar­eas such as smart com­merce and sup­ply chain dig­i­tal­i­sa­tion, Mr Heng said.</p>
    <p>“Work­ing to­gether with our busi­nesses, we will cap­ture new op­por­tu­ni­ties, cre­ate bet­ter jobs, and reimag­ine our econ­omy, so that we can emerge stronger from the cri­sis,” he said.</p>
