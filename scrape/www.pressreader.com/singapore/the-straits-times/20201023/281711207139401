    <p>•</p>
    <p>Six US states re­ported record day-over-day in­creases in Covid-19 deaths on Wed­nes­day, ac­cord­ing to a Reuters anal­y­sis, as in­fec­tions rose across the Mid­west and else­where, prompt­ing new clam­p­downs on res­i­dents, schools and busi­nesses.</p>
    <p>Deaths at­trib­uted to the coro­n­avirus hit daily records in Iowa, Min­nesota, Mon­tana, Kansas, Hawaii and Wis­con­sin, Reuters found.</p>
    <p>Wis­con­sin, Illi­nois, Ken­tucky, Colorado and Ohio re­ported record daily in­creases in new in­fec­tions, the tally showed.</p>
    <p>The num­ber of pa­tients in United States hos­pi­tals suf­fer­ing from the virus on Wed­nes­day hit 40,000 for the first time since Au­gust, ac­cord­ing to the anal­y­sis.</p>
    <p>“Folks, please stay home,” Wis­con­sin Gov­er­nor Tony Evers said in a state­ment on Wed­nes­day. “Help us pro­tect our com­mu­ni­ties from this highly con­ta­gious virus and avoid fur­ther strain on our hos­pi­tals.”</p>
    <p>Mr Evers said a week-old field hos­pi­tal in the Mil­wau­kee sub­urbs had ad­mit­ted its first pa­tient.</p>
    <p>Wis­con­sin is a piv­otal bat­tle­ground state in the Nov 3 elec­tion be­tween Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump and Demo­crat Joe Bi­den.</p>
    <p>By yes­ter­day, the Covid-19 pan­demic had killed more than 222,000 peo­ple in the US, which is the world’s worst-af­fected coun­try, with over 8.34 mil­lion cases. Opin­ion polls show Mr Trump’s han­dling of the pan­demic has hurt his re-elec­tion prospects.</p>
    <p>In Illi­nois, 66 peo­ple died from Covid-19 on Wed­nes­day, the state’s high­est sin­gle-day in­crease since midJune.</p>
    <p>In Kansas, where the death toll rose by 80 on Wed­nes­day, Gov­er­nor Laura Kelly said the pan­demic was putting a strain on hos­pi­tals and that all 62 res­i­dents of a nurs­ing home in Nor­ton County had con­tracted the virus. Ten have died.</p>
    <p>“The tragic deaths in Nor­ton are a stark re­minder that Covid-19 poses a real threat to all Kansans,” Ms Kelly told a news con­fer­ence.</p>
    <p>Na­tion­ally, cases have been trend­ing higher for five weeks, ris­ing to 60,000 on av­er­age over the past seven days from a re­cent low of 35,000 a day in the mid­dle of last month.</p>
    <p>The rise in new in­fec­tions partly re­flects stepped-up test­ing in many states, which has pro­vided a more ac­cu­rate pic­ture of the spread of the virus.</p>
    <p>The US has av­er­aged 734 daily coro­n­avirus deaths over the past seven days, still well be­low the 2,333 av­er­age at the height of the pan­demic in April.</p>
    <p>The lat­est out­break on a per capita ba­sis is most se­vere in the Mid­west, where daily case counts hit a record on Mon­day with over 27,000 new in­fec­tions re­ported.</p>
    <p>Mid­west hos­pi­tal­i­sa­tions climbed to 10,830 on Tues­day, hit­ting a record high for a fifth day in a row and rais­ing fears that med­i­cal cen­tres could be­come over­whelmed like in the early months of the pan­demic in the US North­east.</p>
    <p>Out­side the Mid­west, health of­fi­cials sought to cur­tail smaller out­breaks.</p>
    <p>Bos­ton of­fi­cials an­nounced that pub­lic school stu­dents would shift to re­mote learn­ing be­cause of a ris­ing in­fec­tion rate in the city that was hit hard dur­ing the spring.</p>
    <p>School dis­tricts across the US have been grap­pling with reopen­ing plans dur­ing the coro­n­avirus pan­demic.</p>
    <p>In New York City, home to the na­tion’s largest pub­lic school sys­tem, of­fi­cials or­dered some schools to re­vert to re­mote learn­ing ear­lier this month after in­fec­tions spiked in a few ar­eas.</p>
    <p>In Los An­ge­les, the sec­ond-largest school district in the coun­try, schools re­main closed for in-per­son ed­u­ca­tion for most stu­dents.</p>
