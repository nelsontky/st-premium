    <p>WILM­ING­TON (Delaware) A rosary around his wrist, Mr Joe Bi­den of­ten speaks of the great com­fort his Catholic faith has brought him in over­com­ing the tragedies that have deeply marked his life.</p>
    <p>When Amer­i­cans vote on Nov 3, the Demo­cratic pres­i­den­tial can­di­date hopes he will have per­suaded enough of his fel­low Catholics to back him; a ma­jor­ity of them supported Mr Don­ald Trump in 2016.</p>
    <p>Ev­ery Sun­day, or nearly so, the former vice-president at­tends Mass at Saint Joseph on the Brandy­wine, a small, quaint church in an af­flu­ent sub­urb of Wilm­ing­ton, Delaware, his home town.</p>
    <p>It is there, in the church’s vast and ver­dant ceme­tery, that lie the graves of his par­ents; his son Beau, who died of can­cer in 2015; and his first wife Neilia and their daugh­ter Naomi, who were killed in a 1972 traf­fic ac­ci­dent as Neilia drove her three chil­dren to buy a Christ­mas tree. Beau and his brother Hunter sur­vived the crash.</p>
    <p>On Sun­day morn­ing, un­der the bright red au­tumn fo­liage of a few scat­tered trees, Mr Bi­den and wife Jill again vis­ited the grave – dec­o­rated with small Amer­i­can flags – of Beau, a former Delaware at­tor­ney­gen­eral. Mr Barack Obama’s vi­cepres­i­dent car­ried around his wrist the rosary that his son was wear­ing the day he died; Mr Bi­den said in 2017 that he had not re­moved it since Beau’s death.</p>
    <p>The prod­uct of Catholic schools, Mr Bi­den lives his re­li­gion openly, on a daily ba­sis, and al­ways has. If he de­feats Mr Trump in the election, he will be­come only Amer­ica’s se­cond Catholic president, af­ter John F. Kennedy.</p>
    <p>From quot­ing Pope John Paul II on the campaign trail to in­vok­ing his Ir­ish Catholic roots, Mr Bi­den, 77, is de­ter­mined not to cede the ter­rain of re­li­gion to Repub­li­cans.</p>
    <p>The stakes are high: Mr Trump car­ried the 2016 election over Mrs Hil­lary Clin­ton thanks to ra­zor-thin vic­to­ries i n sev­eral key bat­tle­ground states.</p>
    <p>Ev­ery vote will count on election day. And Catholic vot­ers of­fer Mr Bi­den a rare op­por­tu­nity to ap­peal to the “swing vot­ers” who of­ten switch par­ties from one election to the next. In 2016, 52 per cent of Catholics supported Mr Trump, to 45 per cent for Mrs Clin­ton, ac­cord­ing to the Pew Re­search Cen­tre.</p>
    <p>With Catholics rep­re­sent­ing about one-fifth of the Amer­i­can pop­u­lace, that gap is not in­signif­i­cant. Yet Amer­i­can Catholics are far from a ho­mo­ge­neous group: six in 10 white Catholics backed Mr Trump in 2016, while nearly seven in 10 His­panic Catholics voted for Mrs Clin­ton. And many key mem­bers of the Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion are Catholic.</p>
    <p>“We see the Catholic vote across the board to be a crit­i­cal con­stituency to this campaign,” Mr Josh Dick­son, the faith en­gage­ment di­rec­tor for the Bi­den campaign, told AFP.</p>
    <p>But the ques­tion of abor­tion could be trou­ble­some for Mr Bi­den, even in his own strongly Demo­cratic state of Delaware. Mr Bi­den sup­ports the Supreme Court’s land­mark 1973 de­ci­sion in the case of Roe v Wade that en­sured women’s right to abor­tion.</p>
    <p>If elected, he has promised to safe­guard that rul­ing through con­gres­sional ac­tion if nec­es­sary.</p>
    <p>Mr Joe Bi­den car­ried around his wrist the rosary that his son was wear­ing the day he died; Mr Bi­den said in 2017 that he had not re­moved it since Beau’s death from can­cer in 2015.</p>
