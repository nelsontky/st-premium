    <p>MOSCOW A Rus­sian jour­nal­ist who edited an in­de­pen­dent news web­site died on Fri­day after set­ting her­self afire in front of the po­lice head­quar­ters in the city of Nizhny Nov­gorod. In­ves­ti­ga­tors had searched her home in the city the day be­fore.</p>
    <p>Just be­fore her self-im­mo­la­tion, Ms Irina Slav­ina, 47, founder and ed­i­tor of lo­cal news site Koza Press, posted a mes­sage on Face­book say­ing: “I ask you to blame the Rus­sian Fed­er­a­tion for my death.”</p>
    <p>Koza Press con­firmed her death.</p>
    <p>The lo­cal branch of the In­ves­tiga­tive Com­mit­tee, Rus­sia’s equiv­a­lent of the United States’ Fed­eral Bureau of In­ves­ti­ga­tion, said in a state­ment that the al­le­ga­tion that her death had any­thing to do with the search of her apartment was ground­less. It said the search had been con­ducted as part of a crim­i­nal case in which Ms Slav­ina was con­sid­ered a wit­ness.</p>
    <p>Ms Slav­ina said on Face­book the day be­fore her death that 12 peo­ple, in­clud­ing mem­bers of a spe­cial po­lice unit, had searched her apartment early that morn­ing. Her post said law en­force­ment agents had been look­ing for “brochures, leaflets, ac­counts” from Open Rus­sia, an op­po­si­tion or­gan­i­sa­tion fi­nanced by Krem­lin critic Mikhail Khodor­kovsky, who fled Rus­sia after spend­ing more than a decade in prison.</p>
    <p>The search was con­ducted as part of a crim­i­nal case against lo­cal en­tre­pre­neur Mikhail Iose­le­vich who is sus­pected by the au­thor­i­ties of work­ing with Open Rus­sia, of­fi­cially re­garded as an “un­de­sir­able or­gan­i­sa­tion” in the coun­try.</p>
    <p>Ms Slav­ina’s death came against the back­drop of ris­ing dan­gers con­fronting jour­nal­ists who write about sub­jects deemed ob­jec­tion­able by the Krem­lin.</p>
    <p>The num­ber of threats and at­tacks against jour­nal­ists in Rus­sia has surged in re­cent years, ac­cord­ing to in­ci­dents com­piled by Justice for Jour­nal­ists, an ad­vo­cacy group.</p>
    <p>“Rus­sia re­mains a coun­try where work­ing as a jour­nal­ist is as­so­ci­ated with in­creased risks to life, health and free­dom,” the group says on its web­site.</p>
    <p>Be­fore the search, Ms Slav­ina had been con­tin­u­ously pres­sured by the lo­cal au­thor­i­ties. She was fined for tak­ing part in op­po­si­tion demon­stra­tions in Nizhny Nov­gorod and for men­tion­ing Open Rus­sia in her Face­book posts.</p>
    <p>Lo­cal au­thor­i­ties through­out the Rus­sian re­gions have been putting pres­sure on in­de­pen­dent me­dia out­lets and jour­nal­ists.</p>
    <p>Many jour­nal­ists in Rus­sia have quit es­tab­lished pub­li­ca­tions to cre­ate their own small web­sites or blogs.</p>
