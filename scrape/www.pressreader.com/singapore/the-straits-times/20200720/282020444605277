    <p>Apart from get­ting his kopi-o fix, the other con­stant when long-time Mount­bat­ten res­i­dent C. Ng vis­its the Old Air­port Road Food Cen­tre near his home is bump­ing into his MP, Mr Lim Biow Chuan.</p>
    <p>In fact, Mr Lim is such a fix­ture in the area that he is on a first-name ba­sis with many peo­ple in the neigh­bour­hood.</p>
    <p>Walk­ing around the food cen­tre last Wed­nes­day, he waved to a woman in a clothes-al­ter­ation store on the sec­ond floor of the food cen­tre. “Alice, how are you?” he said.</p>
    <p>Speak­ing in Man­darin, Mr Ng, 73, who did not want to give his full name, said: “There are some politi­cians you never see – or maybe only on TV. But res­i­dents here see Mr Lim all the time. Ev­ery­one knows him, and he knows ev­ery­one.”</p>
    <p>Mr Lim’s pop­u­lar­ity in the area is easy to gauge. Dur­ing re­cent walk­a­bouts at the food cen­tre, pa­trons and hawk­ers called out to him like old friends. As he made his way through the break­fast crowd, pa­trons stopped him to chat or ask if they could buy him a cup of tea.</p>
    <p>Mr Lim, 57, is soft-spo­ken and clearly happy to catch up with var­i­ous peo­ple, whom he is able to recog­nise even when they have masks on.</p>
    <p>Such fa­mil­iar­ity has been built up through reg­u­lar en­gage­ment with the res­i­dents in a con­stituency that has 24,246 vot­ers.</p>
    <p>In the July 10 Gen­eral Elec­tion, Mr Lim won his third term in</p>
    <p>Mount­bat­ten SMC, se­cur­ing 73.82 per cent of the votes for the rul­ing Peo­ple’s Ac­tion Party (PAP) against Peo­ples Voice can­di­date Si­vaku­maran Chel­lappa.</p>
    <p>In 2015, he gar­nered 71.86 per cent of the votes.</p>
    <p>This year, the vote swing for the PAP in Mount­bat­ten bucked the na­tional trend.</p>
    <p>Even Mr Lim was sur­prised by the win­ning mar­gin.</p>
    <p>He said: “Be­fore Polling Day, I had in fact told my team to ex­pect num­bers to go down. We shouldn’t ex­pect to do as well as we did in 2015, where we were helped by the SG50 ef­fect and the LKY ef­fect.”</p>
    <p>Ob­servers have said the PAP re­ceived a boost in the 2015 elec­tion due to sen­ti­ments linked to Sin­ga­pore’s 50th an­niver­sary and the death of found­ing prime min­is­ter Lee Kuan Yew in March that year.</p>
    <p>Be­sides his weekly Meet-the-Peo­ple Ses­sions, Mr Lim also makes mar­ket and home vis­its at least once a week. At the week­ends, he at­tends com­mu­nity events.</p>
    <p>He said: “Go­ing out there to re­ally know the res­i­dents – that’s im­por­tant to me. As their MP, my role is to serve and to help as many of them as pos­si­ble. If I don’t go out there, how would I know what they want?”</p>
    <p>Mr Lim’s wife works in the fi­nance sec­tor, and they have two daugh­ters, aged 19 and 21.</p>
    <p>He en­tered pol­i­tics in 2006 as a mem­ber of the Marine Pa­rade GRC team be­fore stand­ing on his own in 2011, when Mount­bat­ten be­came a sin­gle-mem­ber con­stituency.</p>
    <p>Said Mr Lim: “Even though I have been an MP here for so long, I never take any vote for granted. I am very grate­ful that the res­i­dents have con­tin­ued to put their trust in me. I will work hard.”</p>
    <p>When asked what plans he has for the con­stituency in the new term, he rat­tled off a long list of ini­tia­tives in the pipe­line. For in­stance, there will be no let-up in the fight against dengue – there are sev­eral clus­ters in the area.</p>
    <p>An­other key fo­cus will be road plan­ning to make way for a new MRT sta­tion on the Thom­son-East Coast Line. Mr Lim said he has been in touch with the au­thor­i­ties, pro­vid­ing de­tails on traf­fic prob­lems in part of the neigh­bour­hood.</p>
    <p>He also has an eye on in­te­gra­tion ef­forts when about 1,000 fam­i­lies – mostly young ones – move in after two Build-To-Or­der projects are ready in the next few years.</p>
    <p>He said: “This is an old es­tate, and most of the res­i­dents liv­ing in HDB flats here are se­niors. With the in­jec­tion of so many younger fam­i­lies, we’ll have to see what we can do to in­te­grate them and ac­com­mo­date their needs, too.”</p>
    <p>About 60 per cent of the con­stituency is made up of pri­vate es­tates, while about 40 per cent com­prises pub­lic hous­ing, in­clud­ing sev­eral blocks of rental flats.</p>
    <p>Mr Lim, the son of road­side fruit sellers, has a soft spot for help­ing the lower-in­come group in his con­stituency.</p>
    <p>He said: “I went to univer­sity and be­came a lawyer, so I was lucky to break out of the poverty chain. I don’t think it would be right to stand by and not help them in my po­si­tion now.”</p>
    <p>Ev­ery Mon­day for the last two years, he has teamed up with vol­un­teers to give needy res­i­dents a sim­ple din­ner – spon­sored by donors as well as the Mount­bat­ten Com­mu­nity De­vel­op­ment and Wel­fare Fund.</p>
    <p>Be­fore the Covid-19 pan­demic, the din­ners were held at void decks, where res­i­dents would eat to­gether and play a round of bingo.</p>
    <p>Mr Lim said: “The idea was to get them to come out of their flats, so­cialise and get to know their neigh­bours. It’s tough for some res­i­dents to live in cramped quar­ters all day.”</p>
    <p>With the Covid-19 re­stric­tions, the void deck din­ners have stopped. In­stead, res­i­dents are asked to col­lect food pack­ets. In the most re­cent dis­tri­bu­tion ex­er­cise, about 80 peo­ple col­lected their food pack­ets.</p>
    <p>Mr Lim said: “Many res­i­dents have e-mailed me about their con­cerns over jobs, too, so I’ll see what I can do to link them up with the rel­e­vant agen­cies and help them.</p>
    <p>“No mat­ter what, the work con­tin­ues.”</p>
