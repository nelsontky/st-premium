    <p>Poverty in East Asia and the Pa­cific could in­crease this year for the first time in 20 years as the coro­n­avirus pan­demic keeps peo­ple in poverty and cre­ates a class of new poor, the World Bank said yesterday.</p>
    <p>While China will fare bet­ter than its neigh­bours, the re­gion as a whole is still ex­pected to grow by only 0.9 per cent this year, the low­est rate since 1967, the Wash­ing­ton-based in­ter­na­tional de­vel­op­ment len­der said in its lat­est eco­nomic up­date re­port.</p>
    <p>China is fore­cast to grow by 2 per cent this year, buoyed by strong govern­ment spend­ing, ex­ports and a low rate of new in­fec­tions since March, but the rest of the re­gion is likely to shrink by 3.5 per cent.</p>
    <p>The World Bank ex­am­ined how the re­gion’s de­vel­op­ing coun­tries were hit by the “triple shock” of the pan­demic, con­tain­ment mea­sures and the global re­ces­sion, and called for re­forms to al­le­vi­ate their im­pact on the poor and on growth.</p>
    <p>“While the dev­as­ta­tion caused by Covid-19 is com­mon knowl­edge, less recog­nised is that what hap­pens to the econ­omy to­day and growth to­mor­row will de­pend less on the virus, than on how gov­ern­ments act,” World Bank chief econ­o­mist for East Asia and the Pa­cific Aa­ditya Mat­too told re­porters.</p>
    <p>“With­out mean­ing­ful re­form, growth rates could be as much as 1 per cent lower ev­ery year for next 10 years, with some of the big­gest im­pacts felt by the poor,” he added.</p>
    <p>The re­port es­ti­mated that there could be up to 38 mil­lion more peo­ple liv­ing in poverty in the re­gion this year, de­fined as those liv­ing on less than US$5.50 (S$7.55) a day in 2011 pur­chas­ing power par­ity rates. They com­prised 33 mil­lion who would have oth­er­wise es­caped poverty and 5 mil­lion who had es­caped but were pushed back into poverty by the pan­demic and its ef­fects.</p>
    <p>Un­like else­where in the re­gion, poverty in China is pro­jected to de­crease by 8.1 mil­lion to 9.6 mil­lion peo­ple this year.</p>
    <p>But the es­ti­mate is far lower than the roughly 25 mil­lion Chi­nese who would have es­caped poverty if not for the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>“Sick­ness, un­em­ploy­ment and school clo­sures could lead to the ero­sion of hu­man cap­i­tal and earn­ing losses that last a lifetime,” the World Bank said in its re­port.</p>
    <p>It es­ti­mated that as a re­sult of school clo­sures due to Covid-19, the av­er­age stu­dent in the re­gion could face a re­duc­tion of 4 per cent in ex­pected earn­ings ev­ery year of his work­ing life.</p>
    <p>The twice-yearly re­port fo­cuses on nearly two dozen de­vel­op­ing coun­tries in the re­gion: Cam­bo­dia, China, In­done­sia, Laos, Malaysia, Mon­go­lia, Myan­mar, Pa­pua New Guinea, the Philip­pines, Thai­land, Ti­mor-Leste, Viet­nam and 11 Pa­cific Is­land coun­tries. It was pre­vi­ously re­leased in April.</p>
    <p>While many coun­tries have been suc­cess­ful in con­tain­ing the coro­n­avirus, with many gov­ern­ments hav­ing stepped in to give fis­cal sup­port to house­holds and com­pa­nies, they will strug­gle to re­cover and grow, said Dr Mat­too.</p>
    <p>Among its key rec­om­men­da­tions, the re­port called for coun­tries to de­velop test­ing, trac­ing and iso­lat­ing ca­pac­i­ties to con­tain fur­ther dis­ease surges, as well as a safe way of re­open­ing schools and a fair and ef­fi­cient vac­cine dis­tri­bu­tion sys­tem.</p>
    <p>It also urged gov­ern­ments to widen their tax bases to avoid ex­ces­sive bor­row­ing, boost so­cial pro­tec­tions and equip work­ers with skills to adapt to dig­i­tal tech­nolo­gies and ser­vices that the pan­demic ac­cel­er­ated.</p>
    <p>Sup­port for firms is also needed to pre­vent bank­rupt­cies and un­em­ploy­ment, but th­ese firms should have the po­ten­tial to thrive in the fu­ture, the World Bank said.</p>
    <p>The re­port es­ti­mated that there could be up to 38 mil­lion more peo­ple liv­ing in poverty in the re­gion this year, de­fined as those liv­ing on less than US$5.50 (S$7.55) a day in 2011 pur­chas­ing power par­ity rates. They com­prised 33 mil­lion who would have oth­er­wise es­caped poverty and 5 mil­lion who had es­caped but were pushed back into poverty by the pan­demic and its ef­fects.</p>
