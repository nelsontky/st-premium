    <p>SAN FRAN­CISCO • Face­book yes­ter­day launched a cli­mate sci­ence in­for­ma­tion cen­tre to el­e­vate cred­i­ble sources on cli­mate change, as crit­ics ques­tion its role in the spread of mis­in­for­ma­tion on the is­sue.</p>
    <p>Face­book said the project is modelled on its Covid-19 In­for­ma­tion Cen­tre, and that it had launched a sim­i­lar fea­ture last month on vot­ing in prepa­ra­tion for the US elec­tion in Novem­ber. The tool will be rolled out in the United States, France, Ger­many, Britain and even­tu­ally in other coun­tries.</p>
    <p>“The Cli­mate Sci­ence In­for­ma­tion Cen­tre is a ded­i­cated space on Face­book with fac­tual re­sources from the world’s lead­ing cli­mate or­gan­i­sa­tions and ac­tion­able steps peo­ple can take in their ev­ery­day lives to com­bat cli­mate change,” the com­pany said in a post.</p>
    <p>It said ar­ti­cles from high-qual­ity pub­lish­ers and other sources on cli­mate sci­ence news will also be avail­able at the cen­tre.</p>
    <p>Face­book has faced al­le­ga­tions that it per­mits false claims around cli­mate change through a pol­icy that ex­empts opin­ion ar­ti­cles from its external fact-check­ing sys­tem. It has said it pri­ori­tises han­dling of mis­in­for­ma­tion that poses an im­me­di­ate threat of harm, like bo­gus Covid-19 cures or hate speech that in­cites vi­o­lence.</p>
    <p>Face­book’s global pol­icy chief Nick Clegg said the com­pany would con­tinue ex­empt­ing false claims about cli­mate change posted by politi­cians, even though these are of­ten among the most pop­u­lar con­tent on the plat­form. “No so­cial me­dia com­pany has ever tried to do so for the sim­ple rea­son that po­lit­i­cal speeches al­ways are char­ac­terised by ex­ag­ger­a­tions, se­lected uses of statis­tics and ex­ag­ger­ated claims of virtues from one can­di­date and vices of oth­ers,” Mr Clegg told re­porters.</p>
    <p>The com­pany has not mea­sured the ef­fec­tive­ness of its Covid-19 In­for­ma­tion Cen­tre in coun­ter­ing false nar­ra­tives about the pan­demic, al­though chief prod­uct of­fi­cer Chris Cox said it has seen 600 mil­lion peo­ple click­ing on the tool, which ex­ec­u­tives con­sid­ered a suc­cess.</p>
