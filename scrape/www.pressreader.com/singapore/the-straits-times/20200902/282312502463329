    <p>TOKYO • The Zozo Cham­pi­onship, which was mem­o­rably won by Tiger Woods last year, has been moved to Cal­i­for­nia be­cause of coro­n­avirus re­stric­tions and has ef­fec­tively wiped out this year’s Asian swing of the PGA Tour, or­gan­is­ers an­nounced yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The event was sched­uled to take place at the Narashino Coun­try Club in Chiba pre­fec­ture, but will now be held at Sher­wood Coun­try Club in Thou­sand Oaks, Cal­i­for­nia, from Oct 22-25 be­hind closed doors.</p>
    <p>It will again com­prise an elite field of 78, but the purse has been re­duced from US$9.5 mil­lion (S$12.9 mil­lion) to US$8 mil­lion.</p>
    <p>Zozo is Ja­pan’s first PGA Tour event, launch­ing last year to great fan­fare. Woods, play­ing in the coun­try for the first time since 2006, led from gun to tape to earn a three­stroke vic­tory over lo­cal favourite Hideki Mat­suyama.</p>
    <p>The win also saw the 15-time Ma­jor cham­pion tie the all-time mark of 82 Tour ti­tles held by fel­low Amer­i­can Sam Snead.</p>
    <p>But with lead­ing play­ers based in the United States and the post­poned Mas­ters due to take place at Au­gusta in Novem­ber, the PGA Tour “have come to the con­clu­sion that it is im­pos­si­ble to in­vite play­ers to com­pete in Ja­pan”, a state­ment said.</p>
    <p>The coun­try has es­sen­tially closed its bor­ders to most for­eign­ers in a na­tional drive to re­duce the risk of coro­n­avirus in­fec­tions, but Zozo pres­i­dent Ko­taro Sawada re­mains hope­ful of re­turn­ing to Ja­pan next year.</p>
    <p>“Dur­ing this dif­fi­cult time, we look for­ward to ded­i­cat­ing this year’s tour­na­ment not just to the fans in Ja­pan, but to fans around the world,” he added.</p>
    <p>With com­bined purses of US$29.75 mil­lion, the Tour’s three­stop Asian swing has been the high­light of the Asian golf cal­en­dar in re­cent sea­sons.</p>
    <p>But South Korea’s CJ Cup from Oct 15-18 was last week moved from Jeju Is­land to Las Ve­gas and the WGC-HSBC Cham­pi­ons in Shang­hai from Oct 29-Nov 1 looks cer­tain to be can­celled.</p>
    <p>The US$10.25 mil­lion tour­na­ment has been in doubt since Chi­nese au­thor­i­ties banned al­most all in­ter­na­tional sports events for the rest of the year to guard against fur­ther out­breaks.</p>
    <p>On its Shang­hai event, the Tour said that it would be mak­ing an an­nounce­ment shortly.</p>
    <p>16% Re­duced prize money (US$1.5 mil­lion) for this year’s Zozo Cham­pi­onship, af­ter it was moved out of Ja­pan.</p>
