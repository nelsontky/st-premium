    <p>• Liver­pool were far from their best as they laboured to a 2-1 vic­tory over Sh­effield United in the Premier League on Satur­day but Jur­gen Klopp praised his side’s re­silience as they again showed a knack for over­com­ing ad­ver­sity at An­field.</p>
    <p>Diogo Jota’s sec­ond-half header sealed the points af­ter Roberto Firmino had can­celled out San­der Berge’s penalty as Liver­pool ex­tended their un­beaten league run at home to 62 matches.</p>
    <p>Liver­pool are un­de­feated in their last 13 home league games in which they have con­ceded the first goal, win­ning the last nine.</p>
    <p>They had to do it this time with­out in­jured de­fen­sive tal­is­man Vir­gil van Dijk – his first missed game in the English top flight since Jan­uary 2018 – and at the end of a de­mand­ing week in which they drew 2-2 at Ever­ton and grounded out a 1-0 win in Am­s­ter­dam over Ajax in the Cham­pi­ons League.</p>
    <p>“A tough week ob­vi­ously – a lot of games, a lot of min­utes, tough op­po­nents, hard-fight­ing op­po­nents,” Klopp said.</p>
    <p>“(We) won the two matches af­ter the Mersey­side derby, so re­ally pleased with that, ob­vi­ously.</p>
    <p>“We didn’t score (the third goal) so the game stayed open and they had their mo­ments, but we de­fended well with a big heart. And so</p>
    <p>I liked it.”</p>
    <p>Jota has scored in his first two home league games since join­ing from Wolves dur­ing the trans­fer win­dow. In­cred­i­bly, since net­ting against Ar­se­nal on Sept 28, the Por­tu­gal for­ward has played in eight games for club and coun­try, and Klopp be­lieves the £41 mil­lion (S$72.6 mil­lion) man will get bet­ter once he set­tles.</p>
    <p>The Ger­man said: “He is still adapt­ing. In the mo­ment, a lot of things we do are not nat­u­ral to him but that’s only be­cause Wolves play dif­fer­ent – but a lot of things he did for Wolves are ex­actly what we want him to do.</p>
    <p>“That he is that close al­ready is just a sign of how good a player he is. If he stays fit, he’s 23 and the fu­ture is bright. We will need his qual­ity and I am re­ally happy that he’s set­tled nicely so far.”</p>
    <p>While Liver­pool moved to sec­ond be­hind Ever­ton, United have man­aged only one point from six games and re­main one place above base­ment club Ful­ham. Yet they pushed the cham­pi­ons all the way and man­ager Chris Wilder saw many pos­i­tives.</p>
    <p>“There are a lot of dis­ap­pointed peo­ple in the chang­ing room,” he said. “It was a tight game and it wasn’t one-way traf­fic.</p>
    <p>“A lot of good things tonight but it feels a bit Ground­hog Day but we will get bet­ter and learn a lot from to­day’s game.”</p>
