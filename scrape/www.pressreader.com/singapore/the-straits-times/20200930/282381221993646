    <p>While I un­der­stand the joy of be­ing among the first to own a new prod­uct, a new con­sole is only as valu­able as the games you play on it... Ex­pe­ri­enced gamers will tell you the best games will not come so soon.</p>
    <p>Are you one of those gamers who reg­u­larly pre-order con­soles and games be­fore they hit the stores?</p>
    <p>If you are, you can learn some­thing from the pre-order may­hem that arose dur­ing the lat­est video game con­sole wars.</p>
    <p>I’m a hard­core gamer who has never be­lieved in pre-or­ders. And after what hap­pened, I’m con­vinced I have been do­ing the right thing.</p>
    <p>This month, both Sony and Mi­crosoft said they would open pre-or­ders for their new con­soles, which are due to be re­leased in Novem­ber.</p>
    <p>But things did not go well at all. At Sony’s Play Sta­tion 5 (PS5) show­case event on Sept 17, it was an­nounced that pre-or­ders for the con­sole would start a day later.</p>
    <p>Then, a few hours after the event, on­line re­tail­ers opened pre-or­ders and all avail­able con­soles were snapped up within hours.</p>
    <p>In Sin­ga­pore, the PS5 re­tails at $729 for the reg­u­lar ver­sion and $599 for one with­out an Ul­tra HD Blu-ray disc drive. On the Sony Sin­ga­pore web­site, both mod­els, which will launch on Nov 19, are listed as out of stock.</p>
    <p>Four days after the fi­asco, Sony apol­o­gised to fans on Twit­ter, ad­mit­ting that the process could have been a lot smoother and promis­ing to have more con­soles for pre-order.</p>
    <p>Ri­val Mi­crosoft, which is re­leas­ing the Xbox Series X – the suc­ces­sor to the Xbox One X – ap­peared to be gloat­ing when it as­sured fans not to worry, be­cause it would “let (them) know the ex­act time” the or­ders would be­gin.</p>
    <p>The pre-order started on</p>
    <p>Tues­day last week. It was no bun­gle like Sony’s, but it turned out to be a dis­as­ter too. Re­ports said Ama­zon cus­tomers had trou­ble load­ing the pre-order page and in­stead saw only er­ror pages.</p>
    <p>The good news for Mi­crosoft was that sales of the Xbox One X re­port­edly rose – but prob­a­bly be­cause some gamers, in a state of panic buy­ing, mis­tak­enly thought they were get­ting the Xbox Series X. After all, the names of the old and new con­soles are pretty close.</p>
    <p>On the Mi­crosoft Sin­ga­pore web­site, the Series X ($699.99) and the Series S ($459), a disc-less, non-4K op­tion, are also listed as out of stock. They launch on Nov</p>
    <p>10.</p>
    <p>Mi­crosoft tweeted on</p>
    <p>Wednes­day last week that it was “hum­bled” by the “record-break­ing de­mand” for its new con­soles and that gam­ing fans could ex­pect more con­soles to be avail­able at launch.</p>
    <p>While I un­der­stand the joy of be­ing among the first to own a new prod­uct, a new con­sole is only as valu­able as the games you play on it.</p>
    <p>Both Sony and Mi­crosoft are of­fer­ing new ti­tles when they launch their con­soles, as well as sub­scrip­tion gam­ing ser­vices for fans to stream or down­load games.</p>
    <p>But ex­pe­ri­enced gamers will tell you the best games will not come so soon.</p>
    <p>Xbox’s Gears Of War 5 was re­leased to good re­views last year, six years after the Xbox One X hit the mar­ket. And when The Last Of Us Part 2 came out this year for the PS4, it broke sales records and bowled fans over with gor­geous graph­ics that might have been ex­pected only in the new PS5.</p>
    <p>De­vel­op­ers tend to pro­duce bet­ter games when they have had more time to as­sess the hard­ware’s ca­pa­bil­i­ties.</p>
    <p>So, no mat­ter which con­sole you’re a fan of, you’re not miss­ing out if you do not se­cure a pre-order.</p>
    <p>Give it a cou­ple of years. The next con­sole is likely to be bet­ter, with higher-qual­ity games to boot.</p>
