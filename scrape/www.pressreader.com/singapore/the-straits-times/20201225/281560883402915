    <p>Close to one in four res­i­dents polled in Sin­ga­pore be­lieves a false claim that Covid-19 vac­cines al­ter DNA, ac­cord­ing to a sur­vey by Nanyang Tech­no­log­i­cal Univer­sity. Older re­spon­dents were also more likely to be­lieve this false­hood cir­cu­lated on so­cial me­dia, de­spite it be­ing de­bunked on fact-check­ing web­sites.</p>
    <p>Close to one in four res­i­dents in Sin­ga­pore polled be­lieves a false claim that Covid-19 vac­cines al­ter DNA, ac­cord­ing to a sur­vey by Nanyang Tech­no­log­i­cal Univer­sity.</p>
    <p>Older re­spon­dents were also more likely to be­lieve this false­hood cir­cu­lated on so­cial me­dia, de­spite it be­ing de­bunked on factcheck­ing web­sites, in­clud­ing The Straits Times, ac­cord­ing to re­sults from an on­go­ing sur­vey com­mis­sioned by the univer­sity’s Wee Kim Wee School of Com­mu­ni­ca­tion and In­for­ma­tion.</p>
    <p>The re­sponses were col­lected as part of a larger sur­vey that tracks a group of Sin­ga­pore res­i­dents over the years to un­der­stand their in­for­ma­tion be­hav­iour, As­so­ciate Pro­fes­sor Ed­son Tan­doc Jr, the sur­vey’s lead re­searcher, said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>About 51 per cent of the 999 peo­ple polled on­line were male.</p>
    <p>The re­spon­dents had an av­er­age age of 40.</p>
    <p>On the quar­ter of re­spon­dents be­liev­ing in false claims that Covid-19 vac­cines al­ter DNA, Prof Tan­doc said: “This is some­thing that we need to con­tinue track­ing, as we ex­pect more con­spir­acy the­o­ries and mis­in­for­ma­tion about vac­ci­na­tion to spread in the com­ing months, as more and more peo­ple get vac­ci­nated around the world.</p>
    <p>“The re­sponse to this par­tic­u­lar claim is note­wor­thy, given that ex­perts and news out­lets have de­bunked it, and yet we have al­most a quar­ter of the re­spon­dents still think­ing it is true.”</p>
    <p>He added that the find­ing that older re­spon­dents were more sus­cep­ti­ble to the false­hood is con­sis­tent with ear­lier find­ings.</p>
    <p>“Some older re­spon­dents may not be as tech savvy when it comes to us­ing tools to ver­ify in­for­ma­tion. But... there are other ex­pla­na­tions, and this is some­thing we will con­tinue study­ing,” he said.</p>
    <p>As part of the same sur­vey, more than half of the re­spon­dents, or about 55 per cent, said they were will­ing to get vac­ci­nated when a Covid-19 vac­cine be­comes avail­able in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>About 11 per cent said they would not get vac­ci­nated, while about 34 per cent were un­de­cided.</p>
    <p>This would in­di­cate that some of those who say they be­lieve in the DNA claim are at least will­ing to con­sider the vac­cine.</p>
    <p>Prof Tan­doc said: “Be­lief in fake news may af­fect some in­di­vid­u­als’ will­ing­ness to get vac­ci­nated, but there are also other fac­tors at play, which we still need to un­der­stand.”</p>
    <p>Over 60 per cent thought the vac­cine would be ef­fec­tive.</p>
    <p>Another study led by Prof Tan­doc and re­searcher James Lee Chong Boi re­leased on Mon­day found that younger peo­ple are not im­mune to fake news about Covid-19, with many get­ting news from so­cial me­dia and mes­sag­ing plat­forms in the early stages.</p>
    <p>The find­ings sug­gest over­con­fi­dence in young adults, both in their abil­ity to dis­cern in­for­ma­tion and the risk posed by the virus.</p>
    <p>This was based on fo­cus group dis­cus­sions with 89 par­tic­i­pants aged 21 to 27 in Fe­bru­ary, around a month af­ter Sin­ga­pore had its first case of Covid-19.</p>
    <p>“An im­por­tant con­sid­er­a­tion... is how to make young peo­ple who think they are not prone to Covid-19 to still en­gage in proac­tive be­hav­iour against the virus,” said Prof Tan­doc.</p>
