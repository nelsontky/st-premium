    <p>NEW YORK • Ma­jor League Base­ball (MLB) on Wed­nes­day ac­cused Los An­ge­les Dodgers star Justin Turner of “em­phat­i­cally” ig­nor­ing safety pro­to­cols by cel­e­brat­ing his team’s World Series vic­tory de­spite test­ing pos­i­tive for Covid-19.</p>
    <p>In a sternly worded state­ment, the league said he now faced an in­ves­ti­ga­tion fol­low­ing Tues­day’s win over the Tampa Bay Rays in Arlington.</p>
    <p>The team’s vet­eran third base­man joined his team­mates in cel­e­bra­tion on the field shortly af­ter learn­ing he had tested pos­i­tive.</p>
    <p>His re­turn to the field, which oc­curred right in front of Rob Man­fred, Ma­jor League Base­ball’s com­mis­sioner, raised ques­tions about how the league had al­lowed such a lapse in its coro­n­avirus pro­to­cols.</p>
    <p>But MLB said on Wed­nes­day af­ter­noon that it would in­ves­ti­gate the in­ci­dent, plac­ing the blame squarely on Turner, say­ing he had re­fused the or­ders of league se­cu­rity to re­main in iso­la­tion.</p>
    <p>“Turner was placed into iso­la­tion for the safety of those around him,” MLB said in a state­ment.</p>
    <p>“How­ever, fol­low­ing the Dodgers’ vic­tory, it is clear that Turner chose to dis­re­gard the agreed-upon pro­to­cols and i nstruc­tions he was given.</p>
    <p>“Turner’s de­ci­sion to leave iso­la­tion and en­ter the field was wrong and put ev­ery­one he came in con­tact with at risk.</p>
    <p>“When MLB se­cu­rity raised the mat­ter of be­ing on the field with Turner, he em­phat­i­cally re­fused to com­ply.”</p>
    <p>The Dodgers had pulled Turner, 35, from the game when they learnt of his pos­i­tive test be­fore the eighth in­ning, but he came back to the field dur­ing cel­e­bra­tions.</p>
    <p>He was seen kiss­ing his wife, hold­ing the World Series tro­phy, and hug­ging and talk­ing to team­mates, some­times with a mask, some­times with­out.</p>
    <p>And he took his place at the cen­tre of a team pho­to­graph, sit­ting be­tween man­ager Dave Roberts and An­drew Fried­man, the Dodgers’ pres­i­dent of base­ball op­er­a­tions – none of whom wore a mask dur­ing the photo shoot.</p>
    <p>Fried­man ad­mit­ted that the scene on the field made for bad op­tics, but he also seemed to sug­gest that sen­ti­men­tal­ity for a beloved player in­flu­enced the sit­u­a­tion – es­pe­cially with his con­tract ex­pir­ing af­ter the World Series.</p>
    <p>“For him, just be­ing a free agent, not know­ing ex­actly how the fu­ture is go­ing to play out, I don’t think there was any­one who was go­ing to stop him,” he said.</p>
    <p>Teams have been sub­ject to reg­u­lar test­ing since the short­ened sea­son be­gan in July. Mul­ti­ple re­ports said Turner’s test from Mon­day had come back “in­con­clu­sive” dur­ing the se­cond in­ning of Tues­day’s game. That led the league to ex­pe­dite pro­cess­ing the test from Tues­day morn­ing, which came back pos­i­tive.</p>
    <p>The me­dia have since slammed all par­ties in­volved in the in­ci­dent.</p>
    <p>USA To­day’s Nancy Ar­mour wrote: “The reck­less­ness and in­dif­fer­ence ex­hib­ited... isn’t a mat­ter of of­fend­ing any­one’s sen­si­bil­i­ties or hav­ing con­flict­ing opin­ions.</p>
    <p>“It’s about ig­nor­ing the very real cri­sis our coun­try is in.”</p>
    <p>The LA Times felt that the virus pro­to­cols by league and club were not strictly ad­hered to, there­fore al­low­ing for such an oc­cur­rence.</p>
    <p>“MLB of­fi­cials should have es­corted him from the sta­dium premises im­me­di­ately af­ter he tested pos­i­tive,” said Bill Plaschke.</p>
    <p>“Should the Dodgers have stopped him? Cer­tainly. (They) could qui­etly con­vince him he was not only risk­ing the Dodgers health but also dam­ag­ing their rep­u­ta­tion.”</p>
    <p>The jour­nal­ist added: “But only Justin Turner could truly shut down Justin Turner.”</p>
    <p>Should the Dodgers have stopped him? Cer­tainly. (They) could qui­etly con­vince him he was not only risk­ing the Dodgers health but also dam­ag­ing their rep­u­ta­tion.</p>
