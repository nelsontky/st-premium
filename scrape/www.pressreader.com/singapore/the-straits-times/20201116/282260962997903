    <p>Small firms and sole pro­pri­etors showed they can do bet­ter than the big firms in crim­i­nal law.</p>
    <p>Of the 15 firms named in the crim­i­nal law cat­e­gory of the ST Best Law Firms 2021 list, the top two are small firms – Tri­dent Law Cor­po­ra­tion and Eu­gene Thu­raisingam LLP. And the two are the only firms, big or small, to achieve five-star rat­ings.</p>
    <p>“It is not so much that small firms or sole pro­pri­etors can­not do the type of work that the big firms do or vice versa. Most of the time, big firms do not take on crim­i­nal mat­ters where the clients are not well-re­sourced,” said a spokesman for Tri­dent Law.</p>
    <p>“In par­tic­u­lar, this may be the case for pro bono mat­ters such as those un­der the Le­gal As­sis­tance Scheme for Cap­i­tal Of­fences.</p>
    <p>“When small firms or sole pro­pri­etors take on such pro bono mat­ters, they have gone on to achieve land­mark de­ci­sions, of­ten after lengthy tri­als.”</p>
    <p>She added: “When you look at the num­ber of land­mark cases that have been han­dled by small/sole pro­pri­etor firms in the crim­i­nal space, it is ev­i­dent that it is not so much the size of the dog in the fight but the size of the fight in the dog that mat­ters.”</p>
    <p>The firm’s prin­ci­pal man­ag­ing di­rec­tor, Mr R. Thru­mur­gan, said: “Crim­i­nal prac­tice is a chal­leng­ing area of the law with de­fence coun­sels hav­ing to bat­tle with the vast re­sources of the State cou­pled with the lim­ited re­sources of their clients. This re­quires crim­i­nal lawyers to go many ex­tra miles. Over the years, Tri­dent Law is one such law firm that has con­tin­u­ously gone the dis­tance for its clients.”</p>
    <p>The firm re­cently de­fended Azlin Aru­ju­nah who, to­gether with her hus­band, was ac­cused of hav­ing the com­mon in­ten­tion of mur­der­ing their son. While ac­cused per­sons in­vari­ably seek to tes­tify in their own de­fence, Tri­dent Law con­sul­tant Thangavelu and his team made a strate­gic, al­beit dif­fi­cult, de­ci­sion not to call Azlin as a wit­ness in her own de­fence.</p>
    <p>The court even­tu­ally ac­quit­ted the cou­ple of mur­der and con­victed them of re­duced charges.</p>
    <p>The pros­e­cu­tion is ap­peal­ing against the ac­quit­tal which is pend­ing, said Azlin’s ap­peal lawyer Amar­ick Gill, who is as­sisted by lawyer Ch­eryl Ng.</p>
    <p>Vet­eran lawyer Peter Ong Lip Cheng started his own law prac­tice some 18 months ago, mak­ing it the new­est law firm to have made the list of the best crim­i­nal law firms.</p>
    <p>“In crim­i­nal cases, it is the per­for­mance of the in­di­vid­ual lawyer that mat­ters, not so much the group or firm he comes from,” he said.</p>
    <p>Cit­ing past ex­am­ples of out­stand­ing in­di­vid­u­als in crim­i­nal law like Mr David Mar­shall and Mr Sub­has Anan­dan, Mr Ong noted that this is also sug­gested in the way lit­i­ga­tion doc­u­ments are signed off in the course of a case. “In crim­i­nal cases, the lawyer signs in his name, while in civil cases, it is usu­ally signed in the firm’s name.”</p>
    <p>He also said some crim­i­nal briefs may be un­pop­u­lar and draw abuse on the lawyer who takes the case. He re­called when he was asked to sub­mit the cle­mency pe­ti­tion for for­mer po­lice of­fi­cer Iskan­dar Rah­mat – con­victed of the Ko­van Road dou­ble mur­der – be­cause other lawyers de­clined the as­sign­ment.</p>
    <p>He agreed to do it, though other lawyers had cau­tioned him that Iskan­dar might find fault or make a com­plaint against him if he did not feel the lawyer was do­ing all he could. “I was aware of this, in­ter­viewed him over sev­eral ses­sions in pre­par­ing the pe­ti­tion and we got along with­out dif­fi­culty.”</p>
