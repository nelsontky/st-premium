    <p>NEW YORK • Last year, af­ter Pen­guin Ran­dom House shut down the lit­er­ary im­print Spiegel & Grau, vet­eran edi­tors Cindy Spiegel and Julie Grau pon­dered what to do next.</p>
    <p>Split­ting up was never some­thing they con­sid­ered. The duo have worked to­gether for the past 25 years, first as found­ing edi­tors and pub­lish­ers of River­head Books, where they helped launch the ca­reers of writers like Khaled Hos­seini, James McBride and Gary Shteyn­gart; and later, at their epony­mous im­print, where they pub­lished piv­otal works by TaNe­hisi Coates, Bar­bara Demick and Yu­val Noah Harari.</p>
    <p>Other pub­lish­ers were ea­ger to re­cruit them. But they de­cided to re­vive Spiegel & Grau on their own.</p>
    <p>Last week, the duo an­nounced that they are back in busi­ness – this time, as an in­de­pen­dent pub­lish­ing house with a much broader def­i­ni­tion of what pub­lish­ing en­tails.</p>
    <p>“We kind of looked at each other and thought, what would it look like if we started from the ground up?” Spiegel said. “What would it look like in a world where a book is no longer just a phys­i­cal ob­ject?”</p>
    <p>Spiegel & Grau will pro­duce 15 to 20 books a year, as well as orig­i­nal au­dio­books and pod­casts. It will work on tele­vi­sion and film adap­ta­tions and has signed a first-look deal with Ama­zon Stu­dios to de­velop projects from its ti­tles.</p>
    <p>It is also work­ing with pod­cast­ing com­pany Le­mon­ada Me­dia on orig­i­nal au­dio con­tent and has a forth­com­ing pod­cast, Be­lieve Her, a nar­ra­tive ac­count of a do­mes­tic vi­o­lence case that was re­ported by the jour­nal­ist Jus­tine van der Leun.</p>
    <p>The firm’s first book, Cather­ine Raven’s mem­oir about her friend­ship with a wild fox in Mon­tana, is due out in July next year.</p>
    <p>Though books will be the fo­cus, they plan to ex­per­i­ment with pub­lish­ing across dif­fer­ent medi­ums – per­haps re­leas­ing a project as a pod­cast first, then a book, or de­vel­op­ing a book, au­dio and screen adap­ta­tion si­mul­ta­ne­ously.</p>
    <p>“That was ap­peal­ing to us, to have some­thing that was bound­ary-free, so that we could pur­sue that en­tre­pre­neur­ial in­stinct with­out be­ing hemmed in,” Grau said.</p>
    <p>In a lit­er­ary land­scape dom­i­nated by the big­gest play­ers,</p>
    <p>Spiegel and Grau are among a hand­ful of edi­tors who are re­ject­ing the cor­po­rate pub­lish­ing model and in­stead start­ing their own firms.</p>
    <p>In Oc­to­ber, Molly Stern, who was for­merly the pub­lisher of Crown but left af­ter Pen­guin Ran­dom House merged the Crown and Ran­dom House pub­lish­ing di­vi­sions, started her own pub­lish­ing house. The com­pany, Zando, is ex­per­i­ment­ing with new ways to mar­ket books di­rectly to con­sumers, by team­ing up with high­pro­file peo­ple, com­pa­nies and brands.</p>
    <p>Launch­ing a com­pany in 2020 is dar­ing, even for vet­er­ans Spiegel and Grau. But in some ways, it is an op­por­tune time to in­tro­duce a new pub­lish­ing model.</p>
    <p>While many creative in­dus­tries have been dev­as­tated by the coro­n­avirus pan­demic, book sales are up. Print sales have risen nearly 8 per cent over last year, ac­cord­ing to NPD BookS­can. Rev­enues for dig­i­tal books and down­loaded au­dio are up by dou­ble dig­its.</p>
    <p>Writers who have worked with the pair over the years are en­thu­si­as­tic about the re­vival of Spiegel & Grau. Come­di­enne Chelsea Han­dler, whose 2019 book Life Will Be The Death Of Me was edited by Grau, said she hopes to work with Spiegel & Grau on a fu­ture project.</p>
    <p>Han­dler said of the new com­pany: “They re­ally have their fin­gers on the pulse of when au­thors have some­thing dif­fer­ent to say.”</p>
