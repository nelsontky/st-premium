    <p>WEL­COME, LIT­TLE PRINCE: Hong Kong celebrity cou­ple Kevin</p>
    <p>Cheng and Grace Chan are par­ents again.</p>
    <p>The pair made the an­nounce­ment on their re­spec­tive so­cial me­dia ac­counts on Mon­day and posted a photo of their fam­ily of four.</p>
    <p>Cheng, 50, and Chan, 29, mar­ried in Au­gust 2018 and their first child, son Rafael, was born in Fe­bru­ary last year.</p>
    <p>In a short post, Cheng wrote in Chi­nese: “Lit­tle brother is here. Mother and child are well.</p>
    <p>Thanks.”</p>
    <p>The Ghetto Jus­tice (2011) ac­tor posted a photo of him kiss­ing the baby and an­other photo of him car­ry­ing the child, with Chan look­ing on.</p>
    <p>The for­mer Miss Hong Kong win­ner wrote in Chi­nese on Weibo: “1 + 1 = 4. We come to­gether be­cause of love. Wel­come, lit­tle prince.”</p>
    <p>She wrote a length­ier post in</p>
    <p>English on In­sta­gram: “It’s true what they say: Life is full of sur­prises.</p>
    <p>“A big wel­come to our lit­tle baby boy Yan­nick into the world. Even though you ar­rived a bit ear­lier than ex­pected, our fam­ily is in­cred­i­bly happy to see you sooner.”</p>
    <p>She con­tin­ued: “And speak­ing of be­ing happy: Rafa seems to be get­ting along well with his baby brother too. We can’t wait to see them grow up to­gether – sup­port­ing and lov­ing each other along the way.”</p>
    <p>She also posted a photo of her­self kiss­ing the baby.</p>
    <p>Chan an­nounced in May that she was ex­pect­ing a sec­ond child and she re­vealed that it was a boy dur­ing a baby shower last month.</p>
    <p>The ac­tress told the Hong Kong me­dia that Yan­nick was born on July 27 and that she is on con­fine­ment at home.</p>
