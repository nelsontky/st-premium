    <p>Se­cu­rity was tight yes­ter­day as 10 peo­ple from Hong Kong faced charges in a main­land Chi­nese court that in­clude il­le­gal bor­der cross­ing after a boat they were trav­el­ling in was in­ter­cepted en route to the island of Tai­wan.</p>
    <p>A to­tal of 12 peo­ple – 11 males and one fe­male – were de­tained at sea by the main­land Chi­nese au­thor­i­ties on Aug 23. The youngest is 16.</p>
    <p>The 12, who had all faced charges in Hong Kong linked to anti-gov­ern­ment protests in the city, have been held vir­tu­ally in­com­mu­ni­cado in a main­land pri­son since they were de­tained.</p>
    <p>Chi­nese of­fi­cials, who have de­scribed the group as sep­a­ratists, said two of them would have a sep­a­rate hear­ing as they are mi­nors. It was not clear if the 10 were ap­pear­ing in the court or were at­tend­ing via video link.</p>
    <p>They face charges of il­le­gal bor­der cross­ing and or­gan­is­ing an il­licit bor­der cross­ing, which could carry a sen­tence of up to seven years in jail, the main­land au­thor­i­ties said.</p>
    <p>The case has at­tracted much at­ten­tion in Hong Kong as a rare in­stance of the Chi­nese au­thor­i­ties ar­rest­ing peo­ple try­ing to leave the for­mer Bri­tish colony at a time of grow­ing fears about prospects for the city’s high de­gree of au­ton­omy after Bei­jing im­posed a dra­co­nian na­tional se­cu­rity law in June.</p>
    <p>Di­plo­mats from coun­tries – in­clud­ing the United States, Bri­tain, Canada and Aus­tralia – were de­nied en­try for the much-an­tic­i­pated hear­ing after the au­thor­i­ties said the court was full.</p>
    <p>“We’ve been de­nied en­try. The of­fi­cial ex­pla­na­tion given is that the case does not in­volve any for­eign cit­i­zens,” one Western en­voy told Reuters.</p>
    <p>The de­tainees’ plight has grabbed in­ter­na­tional at­ten­tion, with hu­man rights groups rais­ing con­cern over their treat­ment after their fam­i­lies said they have been de­nied ac­cess to in­de­pen­dent lawyers.</p>
    <p>“They try to say it’s an open trial but they also say all the seats are oc­cu­pied. The fam­ily mem­bers don’t have the right to at­tend the trial. That’s ab­surd,” said Mr Lee Cheuk Yan, chair­man of the Hong Kong Al­liance in Sup­port of Pa­tri­otic Demo­cratic Move­ments of China.</p>
    <p>“They don’t have the right to ap­point their own lawyer. They don’t even know the names of the gov­ern­ment-ap­pointed lawyers.”</p>
    <p>Ear­lier yes­ter­day, the US em­bassy in China urged the au­thor­i­ties to re­lease the fugi­tives and al­low them to leave.</p>
    <p>“Their so-called ‘crime’ was to flee tyranny. Com­mu­nist China will stop at noth­ing to pre­vent its peo­ple from seek­ing free­dom else­where,” the em­bassy said in a state­ment.</p>
    <p>Chi­nese For­eign Min­istry spokesman Zhao Li­jian told a news brief­ing that the US re­marks “dis­re­gard facts”. Mr Zhao also said that China is firmly op­posed to these re­marks and urged the United States to stop in­ter­fer­ing in China’s do­mes­tic af­fairs.</p>
    <p>Pro-democ­racy ac­tivists be­gan flee­ing Hong Kong for self-ruled Tai­wan from the early months of anti-gov­ern­ment protests last year, most of them legally, by air, but some by fish­ing boat, ac­tivists in Taipei who helped Hong Kong cit­i­zens get visas have told Reuters.</p>
    <p>They try to say it’s an open trial but they also say all the seats are oc­cu­pied. The fam­ily mem­bers don’t have the right to at­tend the trial. That’s ab­surd. They don’t have the right to ap­point their own lawyer. They don’t even know the names of the gov­ern­ment-ap­pointed lawyers.</p>
    <p>MR LEE CHEUK YAN, chair­man of the Hong Kong Al­liance in Sup­port of Pa­tri­otic Demo­cratic Move­ments of China, on the de­tainees’ plight and the main­land au­thor­i­ties’ po­si­tion.</p>
