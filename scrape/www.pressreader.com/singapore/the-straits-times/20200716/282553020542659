    <p>Bi­o­graph­i­cal drama Es­cape From Pre­to­ria was to be re­leased world­wide in March and April this year. But those were the months that cin­e­mas in sev­eral coun­tries closed their doors to curb the spread of the coro­n­avirus.</p>
    <p>“I cried, a lit­tle bit,” says di­rec­tor Fran­cis An­nan, 35, in a Zoom call from his home in Lon­don.</p>
    <p>The prison-break story, now in cin­e­mas here, was re­leased on stream­ing plat­forms in some coun­tries. In oth­ers, it was poised to be among the hand­ful of new Western movies to be screened when cin­e­mas re­opened.</p>
    <p>‘When­ever I hear that the film’s in theatres, I’m re­ally happy... On the flip side, the clo­sures might be a bless­ing,” he says, let­ting out a small whoop of cel­e­bra­tion.</p>
    <p>Be­sides play­ing on a sched­ule that is less crowded, it has done well in cin­e­mas in South Korea, Thai­land and Viet­nam, be­cause it is a thriller meant to be seen on a large screen, he adds.</p>
    <p>The film, based on a book by Tim Jenkin, is set in the 1970s and tells the story of South African an­ti­a­partheid ac­tivists, Jenkin (played by Daniel Rad­cliffe) and Stephen Lee (Daniel Web­ber). Held in Pre­to­ria Cen­tral Prison, they plot an es­cape with the help of other po­lit­i­cal pris­on­ers, some of whom have been there far longer than them.</p>
    <p>The prison-break movie is a well­trod­den path for film-mak­ers. An­nan needed fresh i deas and turned to world cin­ema from var­i­ous eras. “I watched 47 films, from Spain, Thai­land and other coun­tries,” he re­calls.</p>
    <p>Be­cause his film, which he had been try­ing to get made since 2012, is based on a true story, he had to tread lightly when it came to em­bel­lish­ing, such as by adding at­ten­tion-grab­bing ac­tion se­quences.</p>
    <p>Euro­pean films from the 1960s in­spired him to look to de­tails.</p>
    <p>“Those films were all about metic­u­lous­ness, but they were also re­ally grip­ping,” he says.</p>
    <p>Rad­cliffe’s Jenkin and Web­ber’s Lee are shown craft­ing es­cape tools from ev­ery­day ma­te­ri­als like wood, then hid­ing them in plain sight dur­ing cell in­spec­tions. These dis­plays of in­ge­nu­ity and ef­fort can be just as ten­sion-build­ing as ac­tion, An­nan notes.</p>
    <p>With two white lead­ing char­ac­ters pay­ing the price for act­ing against racist pol­icy, com­par­isons have been drawn be­tween the cur­rent Black Lives Mat­ter protests and the story de­picted in the film.</p>
    <p>“Jenkin and Lee were two young, white, univer­sity-ed­u­cated men who were ahead of the curve in their anti-apartheid, anti-racism ac­tiv­ity,” An­nan says.</p>
    <p>“In 1970s South Africa, there was a prison wing for peo­ple like them, the white pris­on­ers. It’s an early ver­sion of what is hap­pen­ing now when peo­ple of all races are united against racism.”</p>
