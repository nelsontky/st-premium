    <p>BER­LIN • Gravely ill Krem­lin critic Alexei Navalny was evac­u­ated to Ger­many for med­i­cal treat­ment yes­ter­day, flown out of the Siberian city of Omsk in an am­bu­lance air­craft and taken to a hos­pi­tal in Ber­lin.</p>
    <p>There was no word yet from the Charite hos­pi­tal on his con­di­tion, but the founder of the ac­tivist group that ar­ranged the flight called Mr Navalny’s health con­di­tion “very wor­ry­ing”.</p>
    <p>A long-time op­po­nent of Pres­i­dent Vladimir Putin and cam­paigner against cor­rup­tion, Mr Navalny col­lapsed on a plane last Thurs­day after drink­ing tea at an air­port cafe that his al­lies be­lieve was laced with poi­son.</p>
    <p>The air am­bu­lance l anded at Ber­lin’s Tegel air­port yes­ter­day morning and Mr Navalny, 44, was rushed in a con­voy of am­bu­lance and po­lice cars to the city’s Charite hos­pi­tal com­plex.</p>
    <p>The hos­pi­tal gave no de­tails about his con­di­tion, but said in a state­ment that it would pro­vide an up­date and fur­ther treat­ment once tests have been com­pleted and after con­sult­ing with his fam­ily. It said this could take some time.</p>
    <p>“His health con­di­tion is very wor­ry­ing,” Cin­ema for Peace founder Jaka Bizilj told re­porters out­side the hos­pi­tal.</p>
    <p>“We got a very clear mes­sage from the doc­tors that if there had not been an emer­gency land­ing in Omsk, he would have died,” he said, adding that it would be up to doc­tors and Mr Navalny’s fam­ily to pro­vide fur­ther in­for­ma­tion on his con­di­tion.</p>
    <p>Mr Bizilj, a Slove­nian-born ac­tivist and film-maker, was ear­lier quoted by Ger­man news­pa­per Bild as say­ing that Mr Navalny’s con­di­tion was sta­ble dur­ing the flight and after land­ing.</p>
    <p>Med­i­cal staff at the hos­pi­tal in Omsk had said on Fri­day evening, be­fore Mr Navalny was flown out, that he was in an in­duced coma and that his life was not in im­me­di­ate dan­ger.</p>
    <p>Ger­man doc­tors flew to Omsk on Fri­day to evac­u­ate Mr Navalny at the re­quest of his wife Yu­lia and al­lies who said that the hos­pi­tal treat­ing him was badly equipped. But there was then a de­lay in fly­ing him out as the hos­pi­tal ini­tially said he was not in a fit state to travel.</p>
    <p>Mr Navalny’s spokesman Kira Yarmysh said on Twit­ter that “this is another proof that noth­ing was pre­vent­ing Navalny from be­ing trans­ported, and it was nec­es­sary to do so as early as pos­si­ble”.</p>
    <p>The day be­fore, Ms Yarmysh had tweeted that the Omsk hos­pi­tal and au­thor­i­ties’ re­fusal to al­low Mr Navalny to be trans­ported to Ger­many was “an at­tempt on his life be­ing car­ried out right now by doc­tors and the de­ceit­ful au­thor­i­ties”.</p>
    <p>“This de­ci­sion, of course, was not made by them, but by the Krem­lin,” she wrote.</p>
    <p>Two years ago, Mr Py­otr Verzilov, another anti-Krem­lin ac­tivist and a mem­ber of the Pussy Riot art col­lec­tive, was also treated at the Charite hos­pi­tal after he was poi­soned in Moscow.</p>
    <p>Cin­ema for Peace had also helped to se­cure Mr Verzilov’s flight to Ber­lin at that time. And this time, it was Mr Verzilov who had asked Mr Bizilj for help trans­port­ing Mr Navalny to Ger­many, ac­cord­ing to the group.</p>
    <p>Omsk doc­tors yes­ter­day said they were ready to share all in­for­ma­tion they have with the Ger­man clinic. Mr Navalny’s al­lies have said that they fear the au­thor­i­ties in Rus­sia might try to cover up clues as to how he fell ill.</p>
    <p>Mr Navalny has been a thorn in the Krem­lin’s side for more than a decade, ex­pos­ing what he says is high-level graft and mo­bil­is­ing crowds of young protesters.</p>
    <p>He has been re­peat­edly de­tained for or­gan­is­ing pub­lic meet­ings and ral­lies and sued over his in­ves­ti­ga­tions into cor­rup­tion. He was barred from run­ning in a pres­i­den­tial elec­tion in 2018.</p>
    <p>Med­i­cal staff at the Omsk hos­pi­tal ini­tially said on Fri­day that Mr Navalny’s con­di­tion had im­proved slightly overnight, but that he was still in too un­sta­ble a state to be safely flown out of the coun­try.</p>
    <p>They later said they had no ob­jec­tions after the Ger­man doc­tors deemed him fit for travel.</p>
    <p>Mr Navalny’s wife sent a let­ter to the Krem­lin di­rectly ap­peal­ing for Mr Putin to in­ter­vene and grant per­mis­sion for Mr Navalny to be al­lowed to be flown out of the coun­try.</p>
    <p>The case has drawn in­ter­na­tional at­ten­tion.</p>
    <p>United States Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump said he is look­ing into the sit­u­a­tion, while Ger­man Chan­cel­lor An­gela Merkel called for a probe of the in­ci­dent and French Pres­i­dent Em­manuel Macron said he is ex­tremely con­cerned.</p>
    <p>The Krem­lin has not done any­thing to hin­der Mr Navalny’s med­i­cal evac­u­a­tion, Mr Putin’s spokesman Dmitry Peskov said on Fri­day, in re­sponse to re­porters’ ques­tions on ac­cu­sa­tions from Mr Navalny’s sup­port­ers.</p>
