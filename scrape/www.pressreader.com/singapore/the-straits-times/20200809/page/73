        Insight | | B5 The Sunday Times Sunday, August 9, 2020 Even as necessity dictates that it must be a safe-distanced National Day celebrated individual­ly... this year’s National Day Parade is more similar to past ones than it is different, as an occasion to deepen common bonds and identity. Like a renewal of vows for an old wedded couple, it remains a day when Singaporea­ns reaffirm their faith: not just in one another, but as a cohesive whole, through thick and thin, and in both good times and bad. decade ago, in the lead-up to NDP 2010.
Whomever the newsmaker, there was one constant: a drive to reinvent oneself and find a way to succeed, whatever the odds.
These are the stories that give optimism for the future, and the reason Singapore celebrates. changes, all the time this place has surged forward – never backwards,” he told a crowded NDP dinner at the former Bras Basah Community Centre.
“Make up our minds to make sure that this is ours for all time... that we will stand here and dig our toes in, and build a robust society that will take on any rocks that will health ones like the severe acute respirator­y syndrome (Sars) and H1N1, Singapore has not once missed hosting the NDP to celebrate its independen­ce, said Dr Ng. CELEBRATIN­G SINGAPOREA­NS As with this year’s more intimate NDP, Insight has chosen to focus on the stories of everyday Singaporea­ns who, in their own quiet way, have chosen to rise and overcome and not be beaten down.
There are those who, because of their occupation­s, are on the front line against the virus, caring for patients or securing Singapore’s food supply.
There are those who, despite the painful swab tests and extra safety precaution­s, stepped up to make the NDP a reality in the face of Covid-19, to rally each Singaporea­n and raise collective spirits for the fight ahead.
Some, like Ms Jacqueline Theresa Pereira, are both: The 56-year-old patients’ service executive working in administra­tion at Changi General Hospital will dance for the nation in this evening’s show.
This newspaper, which has documented key milestones in Singapore’s national journey for 175 years, also checked in with Singaporea­ns whom the paper profiled a LOOKING FORWARD come.” At each trial the country faced on its road to its 55th anniversar­y, Singaporea­ns have shown their mettle, and so it must again in the face of Covid-19.
If the virus is a mighty storm that has damaged sails and forced ships around the world into harbour – as Deputy Prime Minister Heng Swee Keat put it in Parliament in June – today would be the day Singaporea­ns pledge to stay a united crew, rowing forward as one.
It is fitting, then, that the maritime sail-past returns this year after a 20-year hiatus, with 13 vessels gliding past the Marina Bay skyline in formation this morning.
As the poet T.S. Eliot once said: “Fare forward. / O voyagers, O seamen, / You who came to port... Not fare well, / But fare forward, voyagers.” What makes Singapore stand apart from other post-colonial nations is that each Aug 9 is a commemorat­ion not of the past, but of the future, for the simple reason that independen­ce was unexpected – its insistence on multiracia­lism saw Singapore exit the Malaysian Federation less than two years after the union.
These beginnings form the foundation of the national psyche, and Singapore’s stance towards each stressor it faces since.
Young or old, born here or having chosen to call this island home, “a shining thread runs through the story of independen­t Singapore... the conviction that the future is in our hands”, this newspaper said on Aug 9, 2003, following Singapore’s successful battle against Sars.
This was the mindset Singapore cultivated from the start. In his first National Day message in 1966, prime minister Lee Kuan Yew sought to drive this home by urging Singaporea­ns never to take the future for granted, but to treasure the dignity and freedom that come from independen­ce by working together for an enduring Singapore. The successive days saw him criss-cross the island to make his point in rally-like speeches, always sounding a note of confidence.
“We have gone through a lot over the last 10 years and, in spite of riots, commotion, tumultuous yanliang@sph.com.sg Marching in mum’s footsteps 47 years later training and capability developmen­t, as well as taking care of his baby daughter, born last December.
His colleagues and supervisor have helped to take the load off his shoulders. “My mother has been very excited. She has been very supportive of this endeavour and has helped out a lot in terms of the household and taking care of the baby,” he says.
DSP Lee is no stranger to the NDP, having been the same police contingent’s reserve commander last year.
Compared with the previous year, preparatio­ns for today’s parade had a much shorter runway.
While training started around early May last year, this year it could begin only after the circuit breaker ended, in early June.
“We were mentally prepared that the parade would have to be scaled down. This is a challengin­g year, and the parade showcases Singapore’s unity and solidarity.” wants to be known only as Madam Soon, 62.
“She had a keen interest in drills, parades and ceremonies, so I guess this rubbed off on me. She would catch the NDP every single year, and as kids we would watch together with her,” he says.
This passion for drills would inspire DSP Lee to join the National Police Cadet Corps while he was in secondary school and, later on, the SPF.
The parade of his mother’s time was a much larger and grander affair, with the contingent­s marching as far as Chinatown from the Padang, he shares.
This year, the parade participan­ts will march in and around the Padang, presenting themselves to a small audience of about 150 spectators seated in front of the former Supreme Court building, now the National Gallery Singapore.
Apart from attending training and rehearsals about three times a week, DSP Lee also had to balance other commitment­s.
These include his job in SPF’s Tee Zhuo In 1973, his mother, then a Secondary 3 student, marched past the historic Padang as part of the Girl Guides contingent for that year’s National Day Parade (NDP).
Nearly 50 years on, Deputy Superinten­dent of Police Lee Ting Wei will do the same today, but as commander of the Singapore Police Force (SPF) guard-of-honour contingent.
The 29-year-old says he is honoured to – quite literally – follow in the footsteps of his mother, who teezhuo@sph.com.sg Navy man takes his sea vessel into heartland This year will mark the third time ME2 Vaengadis is participat­ing in the NDP. In 2014 and 2017, he was a participan­t in the Dynamic Defence Display segment of the show at Marina Bay.
He has been a navy regular for almost 19 years.
ME2 Vaengadis adds that his family, including his wife, his 12-yearold daughter Vashmitha, and his brother, who is also a navy man, will be cheering him on as they watch the parade from home.
“My daughter was involved in NDP 2018 as a stage performer with the schools. I remember taking her to rehearsals every weekend,” says ME2 Vaengadis. “Towards the last part of the show, President Halimah Yacob talked to my daughter and hugged her. That was a proud moment for me.”
He adds: “This year, I will do my very best to make her proud of me. As a Singaporea­n, I’m honoured to be able to participat­e in the NDP. This is a special moment for us to come together and celebrate the nation’s birthday.” mobile column segment, which is returning to the heartland for the second year in a row.
“It will be a rare chance for the public to view the naval platforms up close since they are usually displayed at sea, and I’m proud to be able to bring it closer to them,” says Military Expert 2 (ME2) Vaengadis, 40. As the vehicle commander, he will be responsibl­e for ensuring the vessel is loaded properly onto the transporte­r.
He will be assisting the driver of the transporte­r as they navigate the streets of western Singapore. He says the vessel, which is almost 10m long, is one of the longest military “assets” in this year’s mobile column, and will be challengin­g to manoeuvre.
The route will take him past Ng Teng Fong General Hospital, where participan­ts will perform a salute to pay tribute to front-line workers and healthcare staff battling the Covid-19 pandemic. “I’m very glad to be able to pay tribute to the front-line fighters. I may not be able to show my appreciati­on in person, but I can do it through this mobile column,” he says. Rei Kurohi Navy man Vaengadis Waran is taking his seafaring vessel into unusual territory today – dry land.
As the vehicle commander of a remotely piloted inflatable boat – officially, the Republic of Singapore Navy’s Protector Unmanned Surface Vessel – he will take it to neighbourh­oods such as Bukit Batok and Choa Chu Kang.
The vessel will join tanks, military trucks, fire engines and police cars in today’s National Day Parade (NDP). A total of 66 vehicles, vessels and other types of equipment are being showcased in this year’s rei@sph.com.sg Dancer guarantees a show to remember this will be an NDP like no other before.
Speaking to the media at a preview of the evening show at The Star Performing Arts Centre last month, she said: “In the past, NDP was on an open stage at the Padang or on the Floating Platform, but this year it’s indoors and we are extra careful with safety.”
The single mother with two adult sons added: “It doesn’t change (the way I perform) because it’s in the blood. I enjoy performing.
“It’s a passion. No matter what the restrictio­ns are, we just want to deliver the message that it’s all about togetherne­ss.”
Ms Pereira, 56, was referring to the safe distancing measures for performers this year amid the coronaviru­s pandemic.
For dancers who have been rehearsing three times a week, these measures include staying in groups of five off-stage for breaks and meals, having choreograp­hy tailored to ensure safe distancing, taking temperatur­es twice daily, and taking two swab tests for Covid-19: one last month and another in the days leading up to Aug 9.
Despite these measures, which involve Ms Pereira having to report her temperatur­e four times a day because of her line of work – twice to Changi General Hospital, where she is a patients’ service executive and twice to NDP organisers – she did not think twice when she was asked to perform in this year’s parade.
“Helping the patients (for work) and then coming here and seeing the videos about the front-liners, it’s very meaningful and touching,” she said, referring to the video clips telling stories of Singapore frontline workers amid the pandemic that will feature during the evening show of the parade.
It was this year’s theme of “Together, a stronger Singapore” that particular­ly resonated with Ms Pereira.
She said: “This year’s NDP is very precious. It’s an NDP that you will never forget and you will treasure. All the Singaporea­ns coming together is very powerful.” Jean Iau Having performed i n more National Day Parades (NDPs) than she can remember, dancer Jacqueline Theresa Pereira will be returning to the NDP stage to perform in a character role as well as a modern dance in two acts of the evening show.
She received formal training for all forms of dance at London Studio Centre, where she graduated from performing arts, and has taken part in more than 10 parades.
