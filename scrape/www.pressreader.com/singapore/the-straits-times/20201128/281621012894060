    <p>Pa­trons who were hop­ing to have lunch at Seoul Gar­den in Tampines Mall yes­ter­day were met with closed doors and a sign that read: “We are closed. Sorry for the in­con­ve­nience caused.”</p>
    <p>The restau­rant, which had been open un­til Thurs­day, will re­open to­day after dis­in­fec­tion.</p>
    <p>Last Satur­day, a fam­ily of 13 had din­ner there. One of them, a 32-year-old ser­vice en­gi­neer, fell ill two days later and tested pos­i­tive for Covid-19 on Wed­nes­day.</p>
    <p>He be­came Sin­ga­pore’s first lo­cally trans­mit­ted and un­linked Covid-19 case in 16 days.</p>
    <p>Mr Garry Lam, Seoul Gar­den Group’s gen­eral man­ager, said in a state­ment yes­ter­day: “We were con­tacted by the Min­istry of Health (MOH ) on Nov 25, re­quest­ing in­for­ma­tion as part of their con­tact trac­ing for a Covid-re­lated case.”</p>
    <p>He added that the restau­rant chain later learnt through the me­dia on Thurs­day that a con­firmed Covid-19 case had dined at their restau­rant in Tampines Mall.</p>
    <p>When The Straits Times vis­ited the restau­rant yes­ter­day at around noon, two em­ploy­ees of pro­fes­sional clean­ing firm Clean So­lu­tions ar­rived to dis­in­fect the area, in­clud­ing the food coun­ters, win­dows, ta­bles and pil­lars, with a high pres­sure jet cleaner.</p>
    <p>“Ev­ery ef­fort has been made to as­sure our cus­tomers that the restau­rant is safe... and to of­fer them peace of mind when we re­open the out­let (to­day),” said Mr Lam.</p>
    <p>Last Satur­day, the ser­vice en­gi­neer was at the out­let be­tween 5.45pm and 8.55pm.</p>
    <p>The fam­ily had oc­cu­pied three ta­bles at Seoul Gar­den, and there was min­gling be­tween the groups, said MOH. It added that in­ves­ti­ga­tions are on­go­ing to as­sess if there has been any breach of the rel­e­vant safe man­age­ment mea­sures, and epi­demi­o­log­i­cal in­ves­ti­ga­tions are in progress.</p>
    <p>Seoul Gar­den’s web­site states that a max­i­mum of five peo­ple are al­lowed per ta­ble, and mix­ing be­tween ta­bles is not al­lowed, which is in line with Sin­ga­pore’s safe man­age­ment mea­sures.</p>
    <p>The man’s iden­ti­fied close con­tacts, in­clud­ing the 12 fam­ily mem­bers at the din­ner, have been placed on quar­an­tine.</p>
    <p>Mr Lam said the fam­ily did not come to the restau­rant as a group, and there were no records of a book­ing for 13 per­sons.</p>
    <p>He added that the staff are trained to re­mind pa­trons not to min­gle with other din­ers: “We ob­serve that some­times young chil­dren get rest­less after sit­ting for a long time. When they stand up to stretch their legs, we will re­mind them to stay at their ta­ble.”</p>
    <p>The ser­vice en­gi­neer’s job at Master Sys­tems Ma­rine en­tails go­ing on board ves­sels docked at Ma­rina South Pier and West Coast Pier. He typ­i­cally worked alone, ex­cept for when he in­ter­acted with a su­per­vis­ing crew mem­ber. On days he was not on board ves­sels, he re­mained at his of­fice at Ver­tex Build­ing Tower B in Ubi.</p>
    <p>He re­ported he wore a sur­gi­cal mask on board the ves­sels and at the of­fice, and that safe distancing and safe man­age­ment mea­sures were ad­hered to, said MOH.</p>
    <p>Master Sys­tems Ma­rine’s branch man­ager, who de­clined to be named, told ST the com­pany was no­ti­fied of the case on Wed­nes­day.</p>
    <p>On Thurs­day evening, the com­pany’s of­fice in 33 Ubi Av­enue 3 was closed in prepa­ra­tion for dis­in­fec­tion at 1pm yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>All 14 em­ploy­ees are work­ing from home, and they were told to iso­late them­selves and stay home as much as pos­si­ble, he said.</p>
    <p>The em­ploy­ees are wait­ing for in­struc­tions from the au­thor­i­ties about swab tests, he added.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, the man­ager has sent his em­ploy­ees’ de­tails to the au­thor­i­ties, and will also be send­ing the com­pany’s con­ti­nu­ity and dis­in­fec­tion plans. It has fol­lowed safety mea­sures that in­clude safe distancing, split-work ar­range­ments and mask wear­ing, he added.</p>
    <p>As­so­ci­ate Pro­fes­sor Alex Cook of the Na­tional Univer­sity of Sin­ga­pore’s (NUS) Saw Swee Hock School of Pub­lic Health, said the per­son could have been in­fected on the ships where he worked or at the fam­ily din­ner.</p>
    <p>“I can only spec­u­late about the risks on board the ships he ser­vices, but it seems quite pos­si­ble that in­fec­tion arose there, pos­si­bly through the su­per­vi­sors he in­ter­acted with,” said Prof Cook, who is the school’s vice-dean of re­search.</p>
    <p>“Al­though he wore a mask on board, the mask pro­vides more pro­tec­tion to oth­ers than to the wearer, so he still might have been in­fected de­spite this pre­cau­tion.”</p>
    <p>Prof Cook added that the per­son was more likely to have in­fected oth­ers at the Seoul Gar­den din­ner rather than to have been in­fected there, as the din­ner hap­pened 48 hours be­fore his symp­toms started.</p>
    <p>Pro­fes­sor Dale Fisher, se­nior con­sul­tant at the di­vi­sion of in­fec­tious dis­eases at the Na­tional Univer­sity Hospi­tal, said the case sug­gests Covid-19 may be “smoul­der­ing in the com­mu­nity and trans­mit­ting through asymp­to­matic cases”.</p>
