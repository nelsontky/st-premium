    <p>The pri­vate re­sale mar­ket con­tin­ued to re­cover not just from the Covid-19 fall­out but also from the 2018 prop­erty cool­ing mea­sures, with prices and sales vol­ume pick­ing up again last month.</p>
    <p>Over­all re­sale prices climbed for the fourth con­sec­u­tive month, ris­ing 0.3 per cent month on month in Novem­ber, ac­cord­ing to flash fig­ures from real es­tate por­tal SRX Prop­erty yes­ter­day. Year on year, prices are up by 1.3 per cent over Novem­ber last year.</p>
    <p>Re­sale prices in­creased across the board last month, with prices in the core cen­tral re­gion (CCR), rest of cen­tral re­gion (RCR) and out­side cen­tral re­gion (OCR) ris­ing by 0.5 per cent, 0.1 per cent and 0.3 per cent, re­spec­tively, from the pre­vi­ous month.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, pri­vate con­do­minium re­sale vol­ume rose by 1.4 per cent from Oc­to­ber to 1,426 units last month, SRX data showed. That num­ber is 83.5 per cent higher year on year, and 76 per cent more than the five-year av­er­age vol­ume for the month of Novem­ber.</p>
    <p>Fac­tor­ing in SRX’s re­sale condo es­ti­mate for last month, the num­ber of pri­vate home re­sale trans­ac­tions reached more than 9,200 units in the first 11 months of this year – al­ready sur­pass­ing the 8,949 units for the whole of last year, noted PropNex head of re­search and content Wong Siew Ying.</p>
    <p>Pri­vate home re­sale vol­ume could po­ten­tially cross 10,500 units this year, although it is not likely to hit the 13,009 units recorded in 2018, she said.</p>
    <p>De­mand for and prices of re­sale homes had been muted since prop­erty cool­ing mea­sures were im­ple­mented in 2018, with monthly trans­ac­tions fall­ing be­low 1,000 units.</p>
    <p>But from July to Novem­ber this year, monthly sales have ex­ceeded 1,000 units.</p>
    <p>The re­sale mar­ket re­bounded strongly af­ter a slow sec­ond quar­ter which in­cluded the Covid-19 cir­cuit breaker, driven by pent-up de­mand, a bet­ter match in price ex­pec­ta­tions be­tween sell­ers and buy­ers, and re­turn­ing con­fi­dence as the Sin­ga­pore econ­omy con­tin­ues to re­cover, said Ms Wong.</p>
    <p>OrangeTee & Tie head of re­search and con­sul­tancy Chris­tine Sun said: “Many in­vestors have al­ready looked past cur­rent head­winds and are bank­ing on a vac­cine suc­cess, and are op­ti­mistic that the global econ­omy may see bet­ter days ahead.”</p>
    <p>The high­est trans­acted price last month was for a re­sale luxury apart­ment at Nas­sim Jade in prime District 10, which sold for $11.7 mil­lion.</p>
    <p>The high­est trans­acted price in the RCR (city fringes) was $6.9 mil­lion, for a unit at Co­rals at Kep­pel Bay in the Har­bourFront area, while a unit at The Chuan in Lorong Chuan resold for $3.6 mil­lion, the high­est price in the OCR.</p>
