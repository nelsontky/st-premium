    <p>A com­pany found guilty of a data breach can be fined up to 10 per cent of its an­nual turnover in Sin­ga­pore, un­der a change in the law that pro­tects per­sonal data.</p>
    <p>The stiffer fine, how­ever, will be im­posed only on com­pa­nies with an an­nual turnover that ex­ceeds $10 mil­lion. Cur­rently, the max­i­mum a com­pany can be fined for a data breach is $1 mil­lion.</p>
    <p>The pro­posed amend­ment to the Per­sonal Data Pro­tec­tion Act was in­tro­duced in Par­lia­ment yes­ter­day by Min­is­ter for Com­mu­ni­ca­tions and In­for­ma­tion S. Iswaran to strengthen data pro­tec­tion stan­dards and en­force­ment.</p>
    <p>Other prospec­tive changes in­clude mak­ing it manda­tory for or­gan­i­sa­tions to no­tify the Per­sonal Data Pro­tec­tion Com­mis­sion of data breaches that are likely to harm the af­fected in­di­vid­u­als.</p>
    <p>Also, it is manda­tory that they no­tify those af­fected so that the in­di­vid­u­als can take steps to pro­tect them­selves where pos­si­ble, such as chang­ing their pass­words or can­celling their credit cards.</p>
    <p>The Bill seeks to give con­sumers greater con­fi­dence and as­sur­ance about the way their per­sonal data is safe­guarded, and also how its use is be­ing en­abled in a re­spon­si­ble way in Sin­ga­pore’s econ­omy, said Mr Iswaran. “Key to this are the re­quire­ments in terms of the ac­count­abil­ity... of en­ter­prises or other en­ti­ties who are col­lect­ing in­for­ma­tion for its use, and the en­force­ment mea­sures and other tools avail­able to reg­u­la­tors to en­sure com­pli­ance,” he added.</p>
    <p>“We also want to give busi­nesses greater cer­tainty as to what they need to do to en­sure that they are meet­ing their obli­ga­tions... and in the event that an in­ci­dent were to oc­cur, what mea­sures and steps they need to take.”</p>
    <p>The Per­sonal Data Pro­tec­tion (Amend­ment) Bill, which was among four Bills in­tro­duced in Par­lia­ment yes­ter­day, also al­lows or­gan­i­sa­tions to col­lect, use or dis­close per­sonal data with­out the con­sent of in­di­vid­u­als in cir­cum­stances clas­si­fied as “le­git­i­mate in­ter­ests”.</p>
    <p>Such sit­u­a­tions in­clude us­ing the data from se­cu­rity cam­eras or other In­ter­net of Things de­vices to help in in­ves­ti­ga­tions or le­gal pro­ceed­ings, or to re­cover/pay a debt.</p>
    <p>Un­der the Bill, con­sumers must also be al­lowed to opt out of hav­ing their per­sonal data used by com­pa­nies, such as e-com­merce plat­forms Ama­zon and Shopee, to rec­om­mend spec­i­fied items. Such rec­om­men­da­tion en­gines typ­i­cally an­a­lyse cus­tomers’ brows­ing habits or pre­vi­ous pur­chases, for ex­am­ple, to au­to­mat­i­cally sug­gest items they would be more likely to buy.</p>
