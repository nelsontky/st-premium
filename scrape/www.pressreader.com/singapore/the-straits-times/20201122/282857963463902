    <p>The tra­di­tional con­cept of re­tire­ment has been, well, re­tired at Pru­den­tial Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>The in­surer is one of very few com­pa­nies here that has done away with the no­tion of re­tire­ment for all its em­ploy­ees, in­clud­ing long-serv­ing staff like Ms Sue Li, 64, Mr Ab­dul­lah Rahim and Ms Mary Goh, both 62.</p>
    <p>They have been work­ing for Pru­den­tial Sin­ga­pore for be­tween 25 and 42 years and are keen to keep go­ing, de­spite hav­ing hit the re­tire­ment age of 62.</p>
    <p>The com­pany’s move to do away with tra­di­tional re­tire­ment means that, the­o­ret­i­cally, staff with ex­cep­tion­ally good health and long lives can opt to work up to 100 and be­yond, and on the same em­ploy­ment terms.</p>
    <p>Pru­den­tial Sin­ga­pore has also taken the un­usual step of main­tain­ing its em­ployer Cen­tral Prov­i­dent Fund (CPF) con­tri­bu­tions to all em­ploy­ees at 17 per cent, re­gard­less of age.</p>
    <p>Nor­mally, such con­tri­bu­tions are re­duced pro­gres­sively for older em­ploy­ees, such as to 13 per cent (from age 55), 9 per cent (from age 60) and 7.5 per cent (above age 65).</p>
    <p>But to en­joy this perk, older em­ploy­ees have to main­tain their own CPF con­tri­bu­tions at 20 per cent, like younger em­ploy­ees.</p>
    <p>This un­usual hu­man re­source prac­tice is in line with the com­pany’s “Sav­ing for 100” cam­paign that aims to pro­mote life­long fi­nan­cial pru­dence and sus­tain­abil­ity, as the av­er­age longevity of Sin­ga­pore­ans is ex­pected to in­crease.</p>
    <p>Pru­den­tial Sin­ga­pore chief ex­ec­u­tive Den­nis Tan says: “If we are ask­ing peo­ple to save for 100, we must walk the talk and start with our­selves.</p>
    <p>“Look­ing at this holis­ti­cally, if peo­ple are ex­pected to live much longer, then ‘re­tire­ment age’ should not be fixed.</p>
    <p>“Em­ploy­ees can choose to work much longer if they so de­sire.”</p>
    <p>SER­VICE WITH A SMILE</p>
    <p>Ms Li, who has been han­dling cus­tomer ser­vice at Pru­den­tial for over 25 years, says noth­ing fazes her, not even when cus­tomers are un­rea­son­able or just plain rude.</p>
    <p>What mat­ters more is what she does for the cus­tomers and how she can serve them bet­ter.</p>
    <p>“When a cus­tomer walks away feel­ing happy and good, that makes my day,” she says.</p>
    <p>Once, while she was man­ning a cashier’s counter, a cus­tomer turned up to make pay­ments and she greeted him with a cheer­ful “Good morn­ing, sir!”</p>
    <p>But the man replied curtly: “What’s so good about the morn­ing?”</p>
    <p>While she was a bit taken aback, she re­mained calm and con­tin­ued to process the pay­ment.</p>
    <p>She also wished the man “a good day” and that he would have a great week­end too.</p>
    <p>This time, her cheer­ful na­ture touched the cus­tomer.</p>
    <p>“He looked sur­prised and asked me, ‘You are not an­gry with me?’</p>
    <p>“I told him I wasn’t, and hoped his day would get bet­ter.</p>
    <p>“He seemed im­pressed and mut­tered ‘Good!’ as he walked away.”</p>
    <p>Such en­coun­ters make her even more de­ter­mined to con­tinue work­ing through her golden years to do her part to im­prove cus­tomer ser­vice.</p>
    <p>She says: “I am happy to con­tinue work­ing and learn­ing new things, as I be­lieve that learn­ing is a life­long jour­ney, even for peo­ple who may have years of ex­pe­ri­ence.”</p>
    <p>ADAPT­ABIL­ITY</p>
    <p>Never as­sume that work­ers i n their 60s are “out­dated” and do not have spe­cial skill sets.</p>
    <p>On the con­trary, many older work­ers are more keen to learn and up­skill than younger ones, be­cause many have seen the ad­van­tages of go­ing with the flow when work­place con­di­tions change.</p>
    <p>Mr Ab­dul­lah, a cus­tomer ser­vice of­fi­cer, can tes­tify to the ben­e­fits of l earn­ing new skills i n his 32-year ca­reer with the com­pany.</p>
    <p>When au­to­matic pay­ment sys­tem Giro was in­tro­duced years ago, he took the op­por­tu­nity to learn ev­ery­thing about the sys­tem, in­clud­ing the var­i­ous pro­ce­dures in­volved in pro­cess­ing ap­pli­ca­tions.</p>
    <p>He was so good at it that he be­came “the Giro man” of sorts, not only help­ing cus­tomers ap­ply for such schemes but also con­vinc­ing his rel­a­tives and friends to switch to Giro pay­ment.</p>
    <p>Such skills are even more rel­e­vant to­day, es­pe­cially in help­ing cus­tomers adopt a cash­less scheme for re­cur­rent bills.</p>
    <p>PROD­UCT KNOWL­EDGE</p>
    <p>One big plus that dili­gent, longserv­ing em­ploy­ees have over younger staff is their bank of “in­sti­tu­tional knowl­edge”.</p>
    <p>Ms Goh, who has been a pol­icy ser­vices of­fi­cer for 42 years, is the go-to per­son when­ever any­one is un­clear about the dif­fer­ent types of in­sur­ance prod­ucts sold through­out the years.</p>
    <p>“I can help fill in any knowl­edge gaps that my younger col­leagues may have, as they may be less fa­mil­iar with cer­tain types of poli­cies that are be­fore their time,” she says.</p>
    <p>This is why many com­pa­nies are re­luc­tant to let such em­ploy­ees leave be­cause it is hard to re­place peo­ple with such knowl­edge.</p>
    <p>While Ms Goh hopes to stop work­ing in a few years, she is glad that she is still em­ployed at her age.</p>
    <p>She says: “I have some friends who are al­ready re­tired and they seem quite bored.</p>
    <p>“At least I have work to keep me ac­tive, and I can still go for the oc­ca­sional hol­i­day overseas.”</p>
