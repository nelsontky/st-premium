    <p>Con­grat­u­la­tions to all par­tic­i­pants on com­plet­ing The Straits Times Vir­tual Run! Whether it was 17.5km or 175km, you did a great job in hang­ing tight and push­ing through de­spite the chal­lenges you may have faced. You de­serve a re­ward – be it a good meal or a new pair of shoes this Christ­mas.</p>
    <p>While some may see the com­ple­tion of the ST Vir­tual Run as achiev­ing your run­ning ob­jec­tive for the year, it could be the start of a new jour­ney for many.</p>
    <p>While this year’s run was held in a way that was new to all of us – run­ning our pre­ferred dis­tance, start­ing at our de­sired time and even se­lect­ing our own venue – I am glad that you have all gained the dis­ci­pline and mo­ti­va­tion to com­plete it.</p>
    <p>Al­though you may not have had the op­por­tu­nity to take part in a phys­i­cal race and ex­pe­ri­ence the live at­mos­phere with loud cheers and sup­port along the route, it is some­thing that we can all look for­ward to in the fu­ture and train to­wards.</p>
    <p>Hav­ing learnt more about your body and run­ning tech­niques through this chal­lenge, ap­ply­ing the lessons to fu­ture train­ing ses­sions would be ben­e­fi­cial and a whole new ex­pe­ri­ence.</p>
    <p>So what should you work to­wards next?</p>
    <p>PLAN­NING YOUR NEXT GOAL</p>
    <p>To avoid post-race blues, plan your next goal to keep up the mo­men­tum and mo­ti­va­tion. Clock­ing the same dis­tance or du­ra­tion fre­quently for your runs may bore you over time.</p>
    <p>Try chal­leng­ing your­self with a dis­tance or du­ra­tion that you have not at­tempted be­fore.</p>
    <p>How­ever, be pa­tient and take small steps when you ad­just your mileage to avoid in­jury. Do­ing too much too fast, with­out grad­ual pro­gres­sion, is an in­vi­ta­tion to in­juries.</p>
    <p>A good way to start would be in­creas­ing your mileage within the range of 5-10 per cent from your pre­vi­ous week.</p>
    <p>Other goals could be look­ing out for new races to join.</p>
    <p>FIND AR­EAS TO IM­PROVE</p>
    <p>Re­view your past plans and your strengths and weak­nesses that you may have no­ticed dur­ing the ST Vir­tual Run. Here are some ques­tions you can ask your­self to as­sess and de­cide what to work on next.</p>
    <p>• How is the plan­ning of my train­ing days and dis­tance, is there suf­fi­cient rest in be­tween runs?</p>
    <p>• Did I work on my core/weak mus­cles or over­all mus­cu­lar strength?</p>
    <p>• Did I fol­low my plan dili­gently?</p>
    <p>Work on be­ing more con­sis­tent with the fre­quency of train­ing. Train­ing con­sis­tently helps to main­tain a cer­tain level of fit­ness, in­stead of go­ing into de­train­ing.</p>
    <p>EN­JOY YOUR­SELF</p>
    <p>Many of us of­ten get dis­ap­pointed when we fail to achieve our goals. Set­ting goals is one of many ways to spice up your rou­tine rather than to dis­ap­point your­self.</p>
    <p>En­joy­ing the process and re­wards of lead­ing a healthy life­style is im­por­tant.</p>
    <p>If you do not en­joy the ac­tiv­ity, you will never stick with it. So try all ways to have as much fun as pos­si­ble and feel free to ex­plore dif­fer­ent sports.</p>
    <p>En­joy the calo­rie-burn­ing process, the sweat, the adren­a­line rush. Savour the com­pany of your fam­ily and friends.</p>
    <p>Run­ning should be fun, not a tor­ture. While you are work­ing on your­self and your per­for­mance, do not be too am­bi­tious or al­ways fol­low what is trending on social media.</p>
    <p>Many may at­tempt to fol­low on­line work­outs which are sim­i­lar to a pro­fes­sional ath­lete’s train­ing and get dis­ap­pointed when they are not able to com­plete them.</p>
    <p>This may, in turn, re­sult in fear and re­sis­tance to­wards try­ing a new train­ing pro­gramme or, worse, re­sult in you stop­ping your run­ning.</p>
    <p>Be mind­ful of the in­for­ma­tion pre­sented to you and know that what works for some­one else may not work for you. Con­sult a cer­ti­fied coach for ad­vice if you are un­sure.</p>
    <p>All of us are dif­fer­ent and how well our bod­ies adapt to dif­fer­ent stim­u­lus will dif­fer too and this is the Prin­ci­ple of In­di­vid­u­al­ity.</p>
    <p>I hope that I have been able to ad­dress most of your burn­ing ques­tions and con­cerns ad­e­quately. Thank you to all read­ers for join­ing me over the past few weeks dur­ing this year’s ST Vir­tual Run.</p>
