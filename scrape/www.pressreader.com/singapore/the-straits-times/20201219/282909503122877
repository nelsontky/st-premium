    <p>TOKYO Ja­pan’s govern­ment has raised its eco­nomic growth fore­cast for the next fis­cal year, thanks to its lat­est stim­u­lus pack­age aimed at speed­ing up re­cov­ery fol­low­ing the dam­age wrought by the coro­n­avirus pan­demic.</p>
    <p>The econ­omy is ex­pected to grow 4 per cent in price-ad­justed real terms in the next fis­cal year start­ing next April, the lat­est es­ti­mate by the Cabi­net Of­fice showed yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Its pre­vi­ous fore­cast, made in July, was growth of 3.4 per cent.</p>
    <p>The up­grade was un­der­pinned by the govern­ment’s third sup­ple­men­tary bud­get, which was ap­proved ear­lier this week, to fund the US$708 bil­lion (S$940 bil­lion) stim­u­lus pack­age to help the econ­omy re­cover from its Covid-19-in­duced slump in the sec­ond quar­ter.</p>
    <p>The fore­cast 4 per cent growth for the next fis­cal year would be the fastest an­nual ex­pan­sion on record, if re­alised, since com­pa­ra­ble data be­came avail­able in 1995.</p>
    <p>The govern­ment, which ex­pects the econ­omy to re­turn to pre-pan­demic lev­els by Jan­uary to March 2022, also cau­tioned about risks.</p>
    <p>Pol­i­cy­mak­ers need to keep a close watch “on down­side risks to the econ­omy in Ja­pan and over­seas from the pan­demic and im­pacts from moves in fi­nan­cial cap­i­tal mar­kets”, an of­fi­cial at the Cabi­net Of­fice said.</p>
    <p>The govern­ment will use the fore­casts to fi­nalise the state bud­get for the next fis­cal year.</p>
    <p>For the cur­rent fis­cal year that ends next March, the govern­ment cut its gross do­mes­tic prod­uct fore­cast to a 5.2 per cent con­trac­tion, which would be the big­gest an­nual slump on record.</p>
    <p>Pre­vi­ously, it pro­jected the econ­omy to shrink 4.5 per cent.</p>
    <p>Con­sumer prices re­main sub­dued due to weak do­mes­tic de­mand and the govern­ment’s dis­count travel cam­paign to sup­port the tourism industry.</p>
    <p>Over­all con­sumer prices are fore­cast to fall 0.6 per cent for this fis­cal year, from a 0.3 per cent de­cline ex­pected pre­vi­ously.</p>
    <p>In fis­cal 2021, over­all prices will grow 0.4 per cent, the govern­ment said, re­vised from the pre­vi­ous fore­cast of a 0.5 per cent in­crease.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, of­fi­cial data re­leased yes­ter­day showed that Ja­pan’s core con­sumer prices last month dropped at their fastest pace since l ate 2010, weighed down by the travel dis­count cam­paign and weak en­ergy prices, rais­ing fears of a re­turn to de­fla­tion.</p>
    <p>Na­tion­wide core con­sumer prices, which ex­clude volatile fresh food costs, fell 0.9 per cent last month from a year ear­lier, match­ing a me­dian mar­ket fore­cast.</p>
    <p>It was the fourth straight month of de­cline and the fastest pace of year-on-year drop since Septem­ber 2010, the data showed.</p>
    <p>The dis­count travel cam­paign to boost do­mes­tic tourism weighed on ac­com­mo­da­tion fees while weaker en­ergy costs also pushed down con­sumer prices.</p>
    <p>Over­all con­sumer spend­ing re­mained sub­dued as peo­ple re­frained from din­ing out and shop­ping.</p>
