    <p>Two land parcels for farm­ing in Lim Chu Kang and Sungei Ten­gah have come on the mar­ket. The more than 10,000 sq m plot in Neo Tiew Cres­cent may be used to farm food crops, seafood, quail eggs, frogs and cat­tle or goats for dairy milk, while the over 11,900 sq m plot in Sungei Ten­gah Road must be used for grow­ing veg­eta­bles.</p>
    <p>The per­sonal and ship­ping in­for­ma­tion, as well as or­der de­tails, of about 100,000 Razer cus­tomers around the world had been leaked be­cause a server was mis­con­fig­ured, allowing the pub­lic to have ac­cess to the data.</p>
    <p>How­ever, the cus­tomers’ credit card num­bers and pass­words were safe de­spite the data breach, Razer said in a state­ment last Fri­day.</p>
    <p>The home-grown gam­ing hard­ware firm added that the prob­lem had been fixed last Wed­nes­day.</p>
    <p>When con­tacted by The Straits Times yes­ter­day, a spokesman for Sin­ga­pore’s Per­sonal Data Protection Com­mis­sion said it is aware of the in­ci­dent and is look­ing into the mat­ter. The agency comes un­der the In­fo­comm Me­dia De­vel­op­ment Au­thor­ity.</p>
    <p>The data breach was dis­cov­ered by cy­ber-se­cu­rity con­sul­tant Volodymyr Di­achenko, who wrote last Thurs­day on LinkedIn that he es­ti­mated the to­tal num­ber of af­fected cus­tomers to be around 100,000, based on the num­ber of email ad­dresses ex­posed. Razer has not con­firmed the fig­ure.</p>
    <p>Mr Di­achenko said the server had been mis­con­fig­ured for pub­lic ac­cess since Aug 18, and he im­me­di­ately no­ti­fied the com­pany via their sup­port chan­nel. But his mes­sage was pro­cessed by non-tech­ni­cal sup­port man­agers for more than three weeks be­fore the data was se­cured from pub­lic ac­cess.</p>
    <p>He said ex­posed in­for­ma­tion in­cluded full names, e-mails, phone num­bers, cus­tomer in­ter­nal IDs, or­der num­bers and or­der de­tails, as well as billing and ship­ping ad­dresses.</p>
    <p>In its state­ment to Mr Di­achenko, Razer said the server mis­con­fig­u­ra­tion po­ten­tially ex­posed or­der de­tails, cus­tomer and ship­ping in­for­ma­tion. “The server mis­con­fig­u­ra­tion has been fixed on Sept 9, prior to the lapse be­ing made pub­lic.”</p>
    <p>Razer apol­o­gised for the breach and said it had taken all nec­es­sary steps to fix the prob­lem as well as con­duct a thor­ough re­view of its IT se­cu­rity and sys­tems.</p>
    <p>“We re­main com­mit­ted to en­sure the dig­i­tal safety and se­cu­rity of all our cus­tomers,” it added.</p>
    <p>Mr Di­achenko said cus­tomer records could have been used by crim­i­nals to launch tar­geted phish­ing at­tacks in which the scam­mer posed as Razer or a re­lated com­pany. Cus­tomers could also be at risk of fraud.</p>
    <p>He urged Razer’s cus­tomers to be on the look­out for phish­ing at­tempts sent to their phone or email ad­dress.</p>
    <p>Last Thurs­day, ride-hail­ing op­er­a­tor Grab was fined $10,000 for fail­ing to se­cure its driv­ers’ and pas­sen­gers’ per­sonal de­tails on its mo­bile app, the fourth time in two years that it has been found to have breached data protection laws.</p>
    <p>A soft­ware up­date to its ride-hail­ing app on Aug 30 last year in­ad­ver­tently ex­posed the per­sonal data of 21,541 GrabHitch driv­ers and pas­sen­gers to the risk of unau­tho­rised ac­cess.</p>
