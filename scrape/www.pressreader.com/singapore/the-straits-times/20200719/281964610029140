    <p>NANTES • A fire at a 15-cen­tury cathe­dral in the western French city of Nantes blew out its stained­glass win­dows and de­stroyed the grand or­gan yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Pros­e­cu­tor Pierre Sennes said three fires had been started at the site and the au­thor­i­ties were treat­ing the case as a crim­i­nal act. Of­fi­cials said a probe has been opened.</p>
    <p>The fire en­gulfed the in­te­rior in flames and fire­men brought it un­der con­trol af­ter sev­eral hours.</p>
    <p>The blaze comes just over a year af­ter a mas­sive fire at the NotreDame cathe­dral in Paris, which de­stroyed its roof and main spire.</p>
    <p>“Af­ter Notre-Dame, the St Peter and St Paul Cathe­dral is in flames. Sup­port to the fire­men who are tak­ing all the risks to save the Gothic jewel,” French Pres­i­dent Em­manuel Macron tweeted from Brus­sels, where he was at­tend­ing a Euro­pean Union sum­mit.</p>
    <p>The fire broke out be­hind the grand or­gan, which was com­pletely de­stroyed, said lo­cal fire chief Lau­rent Fer­lay. Stained-glass win­dows were blown out.</p>
    <p>Mr Jean-Yves Bur­ban, who runs a news agency fac­ing the cathe­dral, said he heard a bang at 7.30am. He went out­side and saw huge flames. “I am shook up as I’ve been here eight years and I see the cathe­dral ev­ery morn­ing and evening. It’s our cathe­dral and I’ve got tears in my eyes.”</p>
    <p>The cathe­dral was partly de­stroyed in 1944 dur­ing World War II af­ter Al­lied bomb­ings. In 1972, a fire com­pletely rav­aged its roof. It was re­built 13 years later with a con­crete struc­ture re­plac­ing the an­cient wooden roof.</p>
