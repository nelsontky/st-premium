    <p>SEOUL</p>
    <p>K-pop.</p>
    <p>G-Dragon, the style maven and leader of K-pop boy band BigBang, is work­ing on a new song as the band pre­pare to make their come­back.</p>
    <p>The 32-year-old singer, who com­pleted his manda­tory mil­i­tary ser­vice in Oc­to­ber last year, has been turn­ing up fre­quently at the of­fice build­ing of the band’s agency, YG En­ter­tain­ment, South Korean me­dia re­ported.</p>
    <p>YG con­firmed to the me­dia on Mon­day that G-Dragon, whose real name is Kwon Ji-yong, is work­ing on a new song. But it did not say if this was a solo ef­fort or a song for the band.</p>
    <p>BigBang were hit by a scan­dal last year when one of their mem­bers, Se­un­gri, 29, was em­broiled in drug and pros­ti­tu­tion deal­ings.</p>
    <p>He quit the en­ter­tain­ment in­dus­try and left the band as a re­sult. He has since been in­dicted on ac­cu­sa­tions in­clud­ing pros­ti­tu­tion ar­range­ment, em­bez­zle­ment and il­licit gam­bling.</p>
    <p>This year, BigBang were at first sched­uled to make a come­back after their four re­main­ing mem­bers com­pleted their mil­i­tary ser­vice.</p>
    <p>The four – G-Dragon, T.O.P, Taeyang and Dae­sung – were due to per­form at the Coachella fes­ti­val in the United States in April, but the fes­ti­val was can­celled due to the coro­n­avirus pan­demic.</p>
    <p>G-Dragon’s new song would be his first since he re­leased the EP, Kwon Ji-yong, in June 2017. It would also be BigBang’s first since their song Flower Road was re­leased in March 2018.</p>
