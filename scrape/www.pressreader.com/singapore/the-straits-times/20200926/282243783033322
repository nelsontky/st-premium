    <p>Much as I em­pathise with maids in Sin­ga­pore who want to work part-time to earn some ex­tra in­come on their day of rest, I do not think it is a fea­si­ble scheme (Make it le­gal for maids to work part-time, by Mr Paul Chan Poh Hoi, Sept 24).</p>
    <p>First, a day of rest must be set aside for the maid to recharge, to con­nect with her fam­ily back home or even to en­joy some food or drink with her com­pa­tri­ots at the park.</p>
    <p>Some maids are so stressed at their em­ploy­ers’ work­places that tak­ing away that day of rest might lit­er­ally be the straw that breaks the camel’s back – even if the maid does it of her own vo­li­tion.</p>
    <p>Sec­ond, no em­ployer will be so al­tru­is­tic as to al­low his maid such ex­tra em­ploy­ment.</p>
    <p>Third, if any mishap were to arise as a re­sult of such part-time work, who is to take re­spon­si­bil­ity for the cost of re­cu­per­a­tion of the maid?</p>
    <p>Any­one who needs a maid on a part-time ba­sis can get it from agen­cies that spe­cialise in part-time maids. Phillip Tan Fong Lip</p>
    <p>If any mishap were to arise as a re­sult of such part-time work, who is to take re­spon­si­bil­ity for the cost of re­cu­per­a­tion of the maid?</p>
