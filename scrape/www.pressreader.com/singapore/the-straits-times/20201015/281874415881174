    <p>•</p>
    <p>JOHN­STOWN (Penn­syl­va­nia) US Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump and his Demo­cratic ri­val Joe Bi­den fanned out to crit­i­cal bat­tle­ground states as election cam­paign­ing en­tered a final, in­tense phase amid record num­bers of early votes cast.</p>
    <p>At a Penn­syl­va­nia rally on Tues­day, Mr Trump blasted Mr Bi­den on his en­vi­ron­men­tal and en­ergy poli­cies as a Reuters/Ipsos poll showed him los­ing ground there. Mr Bi­den, mean­while, chased the all-im­por­tant senior vote in Florida as he faulted Mr Trump for his han­dling of the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>The J ohn­stown rally was Mr Trump’s sec­ond event in two nights as he raced to make up for time lost re­cov­er­ing from Covid-19. He plans to hold ral­lies the rest of the week as he seeks to close what polls say is a sig­nif­i­cant gap with Mr Bi­den na­tion­wide but a tighter one in some bat­tle­ground states.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump is bat­tling the clock. Some 12 mil­lion bal­lots have been cast, over 1.6 mil­lion of them in Florida, ac­cord­ing to the US Elec­tions Project at the Univer­sity of Florida, shat­ter­ing pre­vi­ous records.</p>
    <p>The Pres­i­dent ac­cused Mr Bi­den of want­ing to ban frack­ing, the process of ex­tract­ing gas through hy­draulic frac­tur­ing, which he said would dam­age the state’s econ­omy.</p>
    <p>“One of the most im­por­tant is­sues for Penn­syl­va­nia is the sur­vival of your frack­ing in­dus­try,” Mr Trump told the crowd. “Joe Bi­den has re­peat­edly pledged to abol­ish frack­ing. He’s a liar.”</p>
    <p>Mr Bi­den has said he wants to ban new oil and gas pro­duc­tion on fed­eral lands, but not ban frack­ing out­right – though his state­ments on the is­sue have been con­fus­ing.</p>
    <p>The Reuters/Ipsos poll on Mon­day showed a seven-point lead for Mr Bi­den in Penn­syl­va­nia, up from five points a week ear­lier. Mr Trump nar­rowly won the state in 2016.</p>
    <p>Speak­ing to about 50 peo­ple at a com­mu­nity cen­tre in Broward County in South Florida, Mr Bi­den said Mr Trump had reck­lessly dis­missed the threat that Covid-19 had posed to their at-risk pop­u­la­tion.</p>
    <p>“To Don­ald Trump, you’re ex­pend­able. You’re for­get­table,” Mr Bi­den said. “You’re vir­tu­ally no­body. That’s how he sees se­niors. That’s how he sees you.”</p>
    <p>At his John­stown event, Mr Trump pledged to pro­tect se­niors.</p>
    <p>Mr Bi­den has said Mr Trump wants to elim­i­nate the pay­roll tax, which helps fund the So­cial Se­cu­rity ben­e­fit pro­gramme for re­tirees.</p>
    <p>“While I am pres­i­dent, no one will touch your Medi­care or your So­cial Se­cu­rity,” Mr Trump said.</p>
    <p>A Bi­den win in Florida would se­ri­ously jeop­ar­dise Mr Trump’s re­elec­tion chances, and most re­cent opin­ion polls show the Demo­crat ahead with key de­mo­graphic groups in the state, par­tic­u­larly se­niors. Mr Trump won Florida in 2016 by 1.2 per­cent­age points.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump plans ral­lies in Iowa, North Carolina, Ge­or­gia and Florida later this week as he barn­storms through cru­cial states just three weeks ahead of the Novem­ber election. His sched­ule, how­ever, sends him to ar­eas friendly to him, sug­gest­ing that his cam­paign is con­cerned with mo­bil­is­ing his con­ser­va­tive base rather than reach­ing un­de­cided vot­ers, many of them liv­ing in the na­tion’s sub­urbs.</p>
    <p>The Pres­i­dent re­turned to the cam­paign trail on Mon­day night in Florida for the first time since dis­clos­ing he had the coro­n­avirus.</p>
    <p>The rally came hours af­ter the White House said Mr Trump had tested neg­a­tive for the coro­n­avirus on con­sec­u­tive days and was not in­fec­tious to oth­ers.</p>
    <p>They were Mr Trump’s first neg­a­tive Covid-19 tests an­nounced by the White House since he an­nounced on Oct 2 that he had con­tracted the virus. In a memo, White House physi­cian, Dr Sean Con­ley, did not say when the tests were con­ducted.</p>
    <p>Mr Bi­den has been crit­i­cal of Mr Trump’s man­age­ment of the pan­demic. Mr Trump has worked for months to shift public at­ten­tion away from the coro­n­avirus, which has in­fected more than eight mil­lion peo­ple in the United States, killed more than 220,000 and put mil­lions out of work.</p>
    <p>But Mr Trump’s ill­ness has put the fo­cus of the cam­paign’s clos­ing stretch squarely on his re­sponse to the deadly dis­ease.</p>
    <p>In Florida, Mr Bi­den said he was dis­ap­pointed that Mr Trump’s bout with the virus had not left him more chas­tened about his ap­proach to the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>“The longer Don­ald Trump is pres­i­dent, the more reck­less he seems to get,” Mr Bi­den said. “Thank God we only have three weeks left to go.”</p>
