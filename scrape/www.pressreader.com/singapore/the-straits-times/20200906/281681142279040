    <p>Trainee doc­tors de­bated yes­ter­day whether to con­tinue a 16-day strike af­ter an agree­ment was signed on Fri­day be­tween the rul­ing Demo­cratic Party and the Korean Med­i­cal As­so­ci­a­tion, which rep­re­sents 130,000 doc­tors, to end the walk­out.</p>
    <p>The agree­ment will restart ne­go­ti­a­tions on the govern­ment’s much­crit­i­cised re­form plan to pro­duce more doc­tors.</p>
    <p>How­ever, mem­bers of the Korean In­tern and Res­i­dent As­so­ci­a­tion said they were not con­sulted on the agree­ment.</p>
    <p>De­scrib­ing res­i­dent doc­tors as “fu­ri­ous”, Dr Paik Hae-rin, a thirdyear ob­stet­rics and gy­nae­col­ogy res­i­dent at Seoul Na­tional Univer­sity Hos­pi­tal (SNUH), said: “The agree­ment missed some de­tails which we thought were im­por­tant, and we want the govern­ment to with­draw the plan, not restart dis­cus­sions from zero, which means it could still be passed even­tu­ally.”</p>
    <p>In July, the Demo­cratic Party and the Health Min­istry an­nounced plans to in­crease the num­ber of med­i­cal stu­dents by 4,000 over 10 years, start­ing in 2022, as well as to open a new pub­lic med­i­cal school out­side of Seoul to pro­duce more doc­tors to work in ru­ral ar­eas.</p>
    <p>Also in­cluded were plans to al­low telemedici­ne and in­clude herbal medicine treat­ment in the na­tional health in­surance scheme.</p>
    <p>Vice-Health Min­is­ter Kim Gan­glip said the re­form plan would “strengthen lo­cal med­i­cal care by bridg­ing the gap be­tween Seoul and the prov­inces”, not­ing that South Korea’s doc­tor den­sity is lower than those of other coun­tries in the Or­gan­i­sa­tion for Eco­nomic Co­op­er­a­tion and De­vel­op­ment (OECD).</p>
    <p>South Korea had just 2.4 doc­tors per 1,000 peo­ple as of 2017 – lower than the OECD av­er­age of 3.4.</p>
    <p>While Seoul had a high con­cen­tra­tion of 3.1 doc­tors per 1,000, some ru­ral ar­eas had as low a rate as 0.9.</p>
    <p>Med­i­cal ex­perts, how­ever, ar­gued that the pro­pos­als did not ad­dress in­her­ent prob­lems in the coun­try’s med­i­cal sys­tem, such as low pay for young doc­tors, the over­sup­ply of doc­tors in profit-mak­ing sec­tors such as aes­thet­ics and the short­age of spe­cial­ist sur­geons, and were in­stead a move by politi­cians to win pop­u­lar­ity votes.</p>
    <p>Crit­ics said the govern­ment was seek­ing to gain more con­trol of South Korea’s largely pri­vate med­i­cal in­dus­try and thought it could get away with an­nounc­ing re­forms dur­ing a time of cri­sis.</p>
    <p>“Sta­tis­tics show that South Korea has no need to in­crease so many doc­tors,” said Korea Univer­sity’s Pro­fes­sor Choi Jae-wook.</p>
    <p>He noted the coun­try had grown its pool of doc­tors by more than 400 per cent from 1985 to 2015 – 11.7 times higher than the in­crease in pop­u­la­tion.</p>
    <p>He added that 99.2 per cent of pa­tients can get med­i­cal ser­vice within 48 hours – much higher than the OECD av­er­age of 43.7 per cent – and the wait­ing time in hos­pi­tals is just 20.8 min­utes.</p>
    <p>Prof Choi dis­agreed with the govern­ment’s plan to build a new pub­lic med­i­cal school in south-western Je­olla prov­ince, not­ing that the last such fa­cil­ity had to be closed in 2015 due to a lack of a train­ing hos­pi­tal, poor qual­ity of med­i­cal ed­u­ca­tion and a lack of fund­ing.</p>
    <p>He also crit­i­cised plans to al­low non-gov­ern­men­tal groups to re­fer stu­dents will­ing to serve in the coun­try­side to en­ter the school, rais­ing ques­tions about fair­ness.</p>
    <p>Dr Choi Jin-sun, a fourth-year gen­eral surgery res­i­dent doc­tor at</p>
    <p>SNUH, felt the govern­ment should build more hos­pi­tals with good fa­cil­i­ties, in­stead of merely in­creas­ing the sup­ply of doc­tors, cit­ing a pub­lic hos­pi­tal in Jinju city that went bank­rupt in 2013 and had to shut down de­spite nu­mer­ous ap­peals for fund­ing.</p>
    <p>“If the govern­ment pushes through with the re­form plan, it would just be a waste of tax­pay­ers’ money that could be used for bet­ter pur­poses,” she said.</p>
    <p>Pub­lic pa­tience with the walk­out is wear­ing thin. Peo­ple ques­tion why trainee doc­tors were strik­ing when the coun­try needed them most, as coro­n­avirus cases con­tinue to grow.</p>
    <p>South Korea re­ported 168 new coro­n­avirus cases yes­ter­day, the low­est in three weeks af­ter so­cial dis­tanc­ing rules were tight­ened amid a new wave of in­fec­tions. This brings the to­tal tally to 21,010.</p>
    <p>Dr Paik said SNUH has some 900 trainee doc­tors work­ing in three lo­ca­tions. When not pick­et­ing or dis­tribut­ing pam­phlets to raise pub­lic aware­ness about their cause, they have been vol­un­teer­ing in hos­pi­tals to take care of coro­n­avirus pa­tients.</p>
    <p>“The govern­ment wants the pub­lic to think that trainee doc­tors are self­ish but that’s not true. We have noth­ing to gain from this and our li­cence is at stake,” she said.</p>
