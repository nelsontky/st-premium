    <p>BEI­JING/GENEVA • China has joined a global scheme for the dis­tri­bu­tion of a Covid-19 vac­cine backed by the World Health Or­gan­i­sa­tion (WHO), the coun­try said yes­ter­day, giv­ing a ma­jor boost to an ini­tia­tive shunned by US Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump.</p>
    <p>Bei­jing’ slate st bid to join the global fight against the coro­n­avirus fol­lows crit­i­cism over its han­dling of the pan­demic, which has con­trib­uted to a grow­ing un­favourable view of China in ad­vanced na­tions, a re­cent sur­vey showed.</p>
    <p>“We are tak­ing this con­crete step to en­sure eq­ui­table dis­tri­bu­tion of vac­cines, es­pe­cially to de­vel­op­ing coun­tries, and hope more ca­pa­ble coun­tries will also join and sup­port Covax,” For­eign Min­istry spokesman Hua Chun­y­ing said.</p>
    <p>The de­ci­sion, which comes about three weeks af­ter a dead­line set by the ini­tia­tive, al­lows China to pos­i­tively con­trast it­self with the United States as ten­sions be­tween the world’s two big­gest economies spi­ral on fronts from trade to tech­nol­ogy and hu­man rights.</p>
    <p>The Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion has with­drawn from the WHO and re­fused to join the Covax ini­tia­tive, with a spokesman for the White House say­ing the US would not “be con­strained by mul­ti­lat­eral or­gan­i­sa­tions in­flu­enced by the cor­rupt World Health Or­gan­i­sa­tion and China”.</p>
    <p>In May, Chi­nese Pres­i­dent Xi Jin­ping pledged US$2 bil­lion (S$2.71 bil­lion) over the next two years to tackle the pan­demic that has killed more than one mil­lion glob­ally.</p>
    <p>China, where the virus was first re­ported late last year, is also in talks with the WHO to have its do­mes­ti­cally made vac­cines as­sessed for in­ter­na­tional use.</p>
    <p>As many as 171 na­tions have joined the pro­gramme to back eq­ui­table ac­cess to Covid-19 vac­cines for rich and poor coun­tries alike. Par­tic­i­pants in­clude about 76 wealthy, self-fi­nanc­ing ones, but nei­ther the US nor Rus­sia.</p>
    <p>Covax is co-led by the Gavi vac­cine al­liance, the WHO and the Coali­tion for Epi­demic Pre­pared­ness In­no­va­tions (Cepi).</p>
    <p>It is de­signed to dis­cour­age na­tional gov­ern­ments from hoard­ing Covid-19 vac­cines and to fo­cus on first vac­ci­nat­ing the most high-risk peo­ple in ev­ery coun­try.</p>
    <p>“Vac­cine deals are un­der way and we are fast ap­proach­ing our ini­tial fund-rais­ing tar­get to jump­start sup­port for lower-in­come coun­tries,” Gavi’s chief ex­ec­u­tive, Dr Seth Berkley, told Reuters.</p>
    <p>“What seemed like an im­pos­si­ble chal­lenge just a few months ago – en­sur­ing ev­ery coun­try, rich or poor, gets eq­ui­table, rapid ac­cess to Covid-19 vac­cines – is now be­com­ing a re­al­ity.”</p>
    <p>The move also means China will be procur­ing vac­cines through the fa­cil­ity for 1 per cent of its own pop­u­la­tion, the Chi­nese For­eign Min­istry said. China has am­ple ca­pa­bil­ity to make a Covid-19 vac­cine and will pri­ori­tise sup­plies to de­vel­op­ing coun­tries when they are ready, the min­istry added.</p>
    <p>At least four ex­per­i­men­tal vac­cines are in the fi­nal stages of clin­i­cal tri­als in China. Two are be­ing de­vel­oped by state-backed China Na­tional Biotec Group, and two by Si­no­vac Biotech and CanSino Bi­o­log­ics.</p>
    <p>China has also in­oc­u­lated hun­dreds of thou­sands of es­sen­tial work­ers and other high-risk groups, though in­com­plete clin­i­cal tri­als have pro­voked safety con­cerns among ex­perts.</p>
    <p>We are tak­ing this con­crete step to en­sure eq­ui­table dis­tri­bu­tion of vac­cines, es­pe­cially to de­vel­op­ing coun­tries, and hope more ca­pa­ble coun­tries will also join and sup­port Covax.</p>
