    <p>Police are in­ves­ti­gat­ing a group of 44 peo­ple who had gath­ered at an in­dus­trial build­ing in Boon Lay Way and were drink­ing, smok­ing and singing in an empty of­fice past 1am on New Year’s Day on Fri­day.</p>
    <p>The police said in a state­ment last night that the 44 peo­ple com­prise 41 Sin­ga­pore­ans, a Sin­ga­pore per­ma­nent res­i­dent, a Malaysian and a Chi­nese na­tional.</p>
    <p>They are be­ing in­ves­ti­gated for non-com­pli­ance with safe dis­tanc­ing mea­sures un­der the Covid-19 (Tem­po­rary Mea­sures) (Con­trol Or­der) Reg­u­la­tions 2020.</p>
    <p>The police said that they re­ceived a re­port about the gath­er­ing at 1.20am on Fri­day, and found a large group of 29 men and 15 women, aged be­tween 17 and 34, when they ar­rived.</p>
    <p>They added that pre­lim­i­nary in­ves­ti­ga­tions had found that the peo­ple al­legedly gath­ered to so­cialise and the premises were not li­censed to pro­vide public en­ter­tain­ment.</p>
    <p>The police are in­ves­ti­gat­ing the in­ci­dent.</p>
    <p>Un­der the Public En­ter­tain­ment Act, the of­fence of pro­vid­ing public en­ter­tain­ment with­out a valid li­cence car­ries a fine of up to $20,000.</p>
    <p>For non-com­pli­ance with safe dis­tanc­ing mea­sures un­der Covid-19 rules, of­fend­ers may be jailed for up to six months, fined up to $10,000, or both.</p>
    <p>“Mem­bers of the public are ad­vised to take the pre­vail­ing safe dis­tanc­ing mea­sures se­ri­ously,” said the police.</p>
    <p>Separately, the Health Min­istry confirmed 33 new Covid-19 cases yes­ter­day, all im­ported. Two were symp­to­matic while the rest were asymp­to­matic. All had been placed on stay-home no­tices or iso­lated on ar­rival in Sin­ga­pore.</p>

    <p>Among yes­ter­day’s 33 new cases was a three­year-old girl from In­dia who is a de­pen­dant’s pass holder, and nine for­eign do­mes­tic work­ers.</p>
    <p>There was also one short-term visit pass holder who ar­rived from In­done­sia to visit her Sin­ga­porean par­ent.</p>
    <p>There were no new com­mu­nity cases and none from work­ers’ dor­mi­to­ries.</p>

    <p>The num­ber of un­linked cases in the com­mu­nity has also in­creased from one case in the week be­fore to four cases in the past week.</p>
