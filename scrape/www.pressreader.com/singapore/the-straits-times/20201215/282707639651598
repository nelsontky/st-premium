    <p>HONG KONG • Hong Kong ac­tress-singer Gil­lian Chung (left) has told the Hong Kong me­dia she will not marry again af­ter her sep­a­ra­tion from Tai­wanese aes­thet­ics doc­tor Michael Lai.</p>
    <p>Dr Lai, 31, an­nounced in May that they had split up af­ter less than two years of mar­riage. Their di­vorce will be fi­nalised in less than 80 days.</p>
    <p>Chung, 39, told Hong Kong’s Ori­en­tal Daily News (ODN): “I don’t think I will marry again. Be­ing mar­ried once is enough as I don’t think I am suited for mar­riage.”</p>
    <p>There were var­i­ous al­le­ga­tions sur­round­ing their split, but Chung told ODN they still com­mu­ni­cated dur­ing their sep­a­ra­tion.</p>
    <p>“We are still com­fort­able be­ing friends,” said the singer from Can­topop duo Twins.</p>
    <p>Chung said she would not think of dat­ing now even if there were suit­ors and would con­cen­trate on her work for the time be­ing.</p>
    <p>She was film­ing a movie in Xi­a­men, China, in Septem­ber when she suf­fered a se­ri­ous head in­jury af­ter an ac­ci­dent in her ho­tel room.</p>
    <p>Her wound was re­ported to be 6cm long and re­quired dozens of stitches at the hos­pi­tal be­fore she went for a sec­ond op­er­a­tion to re­duce the like­li­hood of scar­ring on her face.</p>
    <p>She told ODN that she did not know that her in­jury would be so se­ri­ous, but she was not wor­ried. “I re­mem­ber fall­ing asleep af­ter the first op­er­a­tion,” she said. “I was not that wor­ried about my looks as tech­nol­ogy is so ad­vanced nowa­days.”</p>
