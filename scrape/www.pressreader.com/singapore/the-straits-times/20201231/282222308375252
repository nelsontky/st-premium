    <p>The first coastal fa­cil­ity for post­death rites will be built at Changi Beach, but the Na­tional En­vi­ron­ment Agency (NEA) will not pro­ceed with a pre­vi­ously announced sea burial site in Tanah Merah.</p>
    <p>Fol­low­ing ex­ten­sive re­view and con­sul­ta­tions with rel­e­vant public agen­cies and stake­hold­ers, the site at Changi Beach – lo­cated be­hind</p>
    <p>Carpark 2 and be­tween two pavil­ions – will be des­ig­nated for con­duct­ing post-death rites, said the NEA in a state­ment yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The site will not be used for the scat­ter­ing of ashes, which is done at des­ig­nated lo­ca­tions, in­clud­ing a site south of Pu­lau Se­makau.</p>
    <p>The Changi Beach site has a carpark and toi­lets, and is near public bus ser­vices. NEA said more de­tailed pa­ram­e­ters of the fa­cil­ity are be­ing worked out.</p>
    <p>In 2018, NEA announced a sea burial fa­cil­ity that will be built along the shore­line in Tanah Merah, with a board­walk that ex­tends into the sea to al­low the scat­ter­ing of ashes.</p>
    <p>But the plan re­ceived op­po­si­tion from the public and the sea sports com­mu­nity, as up to five wa­ter sports cen­tres, in­clud­ing the Na­tional Sail­ing Cen­tre, are lo­cated near the pro­posed site.</p>
    <p>There were also con­cerns over the pos­si­bil­ity of swim­ming among – or even in­gest­ing – hu­man re­mains.</p>
    <p>NEA then com­mis­sioned an En­vi­ron­men­tal Im­pact Study. Although it did not high­light any sig­nif­i­cant ad­verse im­pact if the fa­cil­ity were built in Tanah Merah, a pre­lim­i­nary de­sign study iden­ti­fied some safety con­cerns.</p>
    <p>It found that it was not fea­si­ble to con­duct post-death rites in the area due to the gra­di­ent of the beach and sea tidal con­di­tions at the site.</p>
    <p>The fa­cil­ity at Changi Beach, which will be prop­erly de­mar­cated and en­closed, is in re­sponse to public feed­back to pre­serve the dig­nity and deco­rum of after-death pro­ceed­ings, and to en­sure ad­e­quate pro­vi­sion of after-death fa­cil­i­ties.</p>
    <p>It will be open to all com­mu­ni­ties, although the Hindu com­mu­nity is ex­pected to be the main users.</p>
    <p>Such rites will mostly be con­ducted dur­ing pre-dawn hours, thus min­imis­ing any in­con­ve­nience to beach users, said the NEA.</p>
    <p>The Hindu Ad­vi­sory Board’s chair­man, Mr Ra­jan Kr­ish­nan, said he is pleased that the Hindu com­mu­nity will have a proper des­ig­nated site for post-death rit­u­als, and he hopes that the Changi Beach site will be shel­tered.</p>
    <p>“Cur­rently, many in the com­mu­nity would go to an open spot near a carpark at Changi Beach, place a mat on the ground and con­duct sim­ple prayers, and take a dip in the sea be­fore com­plet­ing the rites,” he said.</p>
    <p>“We’ve been ask­ing for a proper place with shel­ter, so that if it rains, we can con­duct the rites with more deco­rum.”</p>
    <p>The NEA did not spec­ify if the new site will be shel­tered.</p>
    <p>The scat­ter­ing of ashes in the sea usu­ally hap­pens three days after cre­ma­tion, and post-death rites are usu­ally con­ducted after 11 or 30 days fol­low­ing the death, added Mr Ra­jan.</p>
    <p>Mr Si­mon Pu­ga­len­thi, di­rec­tor of Khailaash Fu­neral Ser­vices, said the Changi Beach site is the “next best op­tion” than the pre­vi­ously pro­posed site in Tanah Merah which is not as ac­ces­si­ble.</p>
    <p>Mr Chung Pei Ming, gen­eral man­ager of the Sin­ga­pore Sail­ing Fed­er­a­tion, said NEA has been thor­ough in its en­gage­ment with the af­fected com­mu­ni­ties in Tanah Merah and it is a “win-win for ev­ery­one” to set­tle on the Changi site.</p>
