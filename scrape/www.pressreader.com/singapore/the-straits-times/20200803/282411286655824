    <p>PARIS • Up to 40 per cent of de­men­tia cases could be pre­vented or de­layed, ac­cord­ing to a re­port pub­lished last Thurs­day, which called for ur­gent ac­tion on risk fac­tors from ex­ces­sive drink­ing to air pol­lu­tion.</p>
    <p>The num­ber of peo­ple around the world liv­ing with de­men­tia is ex­pected to soar from around 50 mil­lion to­day to more than 150 mil­lion by 2050.</p>
    <p>But ex­perts in a com­mis­sion for the journal The Lancet said a range of pol­icy ac­tions could dra­mat­i­cally re­duce or de­lay cases, in up­dated re­search based on anal­y­sis of a wide va­ri­ety of in­ter­na­tional stud­ies.</p>
    <p>The re­port said a lack of ed­u­ca­tion in child­hood, mid-life hear­ing loss and smok­ing i n older age ac­counted for 7 per cent, 8 per cent and 5 per cent of de­men­tia cases re­spec­tively.</p>
    <p>It also iden­ti­fied three new risks – head in­juries and ex­ces­sive al­co­hol con­sump­tion in middle age and ex­po­sure to air pol­lu­tion later in life – which to­gether are as­so­ci­ated with 6 per cent of all cases.</p>
    <p>“Our re­port shows that it is within the power of pol­i­cy­mak­ers and in­di­vid­u­als to pre­vent and de­lay a sig­nif­i­cant pro­por­tion of de­men­tia, with op­por­tu­ni­ties to make an im­pact at each stage of a per­son’s life,” said lead au­thor Gill Liv­ingston of Univer­sity Col­lege Lon­don.</p>
    <p>The study’s rec­om­men­da­tions in­cluded healthy life­styles, poli­cies to tackle pol­lu­tion and pre­vent head in­juries in high-risk oc­cu­pa­tions, and ini­tia­tives such as pro­vid­ing hear­ing aids.</p>
    <p>De­men­tia is caused when the brain is dam­aged by diseases such as Alzheimer’s or stroke. It can af­fect peo­ple’s mem­ory, moods and their abil­ity to per­form daily tasks.</p>
    <p>Be­yond the chal­lenges it poses to in­di­vid­u­als and fam­i­lies, ex­perts es­ti­mate its eco­nomic cost at about US$1 tril­lion (S$1.4 tril­lion) a year.</p>
    <p>The num­ber of peo­ple liv­ing with de­men­tia has surged as the global pop­u­la­tion ex­pands and peo­ple live longer. Some two-thirds of peo­ple with de­men­tia are now liv­ing in lowand middle- in­come coun­tries.</p>
    <p>The au­thors said tack­ling risk fac­tors in th­ese na­tions and among de­prived com­mu­ni­ties in richer coun­tries would have the great­est im­pact.</p>
    <p>But co-au­thor Ades­ola Ogun­niyi, of the Univer­sity of Ibadan in Nige­ria, called for more re­search in th­ese so­ci­eties, with nearly all the ev­i­dence for de­men­tia cur­rently from stud­ies in high-in­come coun­tries.</p>
    <p>Other fac­tors iden­ti­fied in the re­port were hy­per­ten­sion (2 per cent) in mid-life, obe­sity in middle age (1 per cent), de­pres­sion (4 per cent), so­cial iso­la­tion (4 per cent), phys­i­cal in­ac­tiv­ity (2 per cent) and di­a­betes (1 per cent).</p>
    <p>Re­spond­ing to the study, Pro­fes­sor Tara Spires-Jones, of the UK De­men­tia Re­search In­sti­tute at the Univer­sity of Ed­in­burgh, said it pro­vided an im­por­tant set of prac­ti­cal mea­sures that peo­ple can take to re­duce their risk of de­men­tia.</p>
    <p>But she noted that the study sug­gested 60 per cent of cases “are, to the best of our knowl­edge, caused by things peo­ple can­not con­trol, like their genes, so I hope this re­port will not lead to peo­ple feel­ing like hav­ing de­men­tia is their ‘fault’”.</p>
    <p>She cau­tioned that the data used “does not prove cau­sa­tion”, adding there was ev­i­dence that brain changes in early de­men­tia cause de­pres­sion.</p>
