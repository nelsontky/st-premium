    <p>BER­LIN • An un­prece­dented con­ti­nent-wide vac­ci­na­tion cam­paign was un­der way in Europe yes­ter­day, with Italy, Spain, Ger­many, Aus­tria, France and the Nordics all launch­ing their in­oc­u­la­tion pro­grammes, less than a week af­ter the EU cleared a shot de­vel­oped by Pfizer and BioNTech.</p>
    <p>“Thank God,” 96-year-old Araceli Hi­dalgo said as she be­came the first per­son in Spain to get the vac­cine at her care home in Guadala­jara, near the cap­i­tal Madrid. “Let’s see if we can make this virus go away.”</p>
    <p>The Euro­pean Union be­gan vac­ci­nat­ing against Covid-19 as mem­bers of the 27-na­tion bloc strug­gle with a ris­ing death toll from the virus. Sev­eral Euro­pean na­tions, in­clud­ing Ger­many, have im­posed tougher curbs in an ef­fort to con­tain a win­ter surge in in­fec­tions and deaths.</p>
    <p>It will take months to in­oc­u­late enough peo­ple to have an im­pact on the spread of the dis­ease, but the sense of ur­gency has grown af­ter neigh­bour­ing Bri­tain locked down parts of the coun­try, blam­ing a faster-spread­ing mu­tant strain.</p>
    <p>“Once enough peo­ple have been vac­ci­nated, we can start trav­el­ling, meet­ing our friends and fam­ily again, and have nor­mal hol­i­days, which we all long for,” Euro­pean Com­mis­sion pres­i­dent Ur­sula von der Leyen said on Satur­day in a video mes­sage to mark “De­liv­ery Day”.</p>
    <p>Europe is start­ing the cam­paign to in­oc­u­late its 450 mil­lion cit­i­zens weeks af­ter Bri­tain and the United States be­gan their own vac­ci­na­tion pro­grammes. More than 600,000 peo­ple in Bri­tain and nearly two mil­lion in the US have re­ceived their</p>
    <p>first shot of the stan­dard two-dose reg­i­men.</p>
    <p>De­spite the agreed EU roll-out date, some na­tions – in­clud­ing Ger­many and Hun­gary – al­ready be­gan ad­min­is­ter­ing vac­cines on Satur­day, lo­cal me­dia re­ported.</p>
    <p>In the eastern Ger­man city of Hal­ber­stadt, a 101-year-old woman and around 40 oth­ers in a care home for the el­derly were in­oc­u­lated, ac­cord­ing to DPA. “Every day we wait is a day too many,” the news agency quoted the head of the home, Mr To­bias Krueger, as say­ing.</p>
    <p>Italy and Por­tu­gal be­gan their vac­ci­na­tion cam­paigns yes­ter­day by in­oc­u­lat­ing health­care work­ers, while in Den­mark and Swe­den, res­i­dents at el­derly care cen­tres re­ceived the first shots. Greece’s Pres­i­dent Ka­te­rina Sakel­laropoulou and Prime Min­is­ter Kyr­i­akos Mit­so­takis were vac­ci­nated af­ter the coun­try gave the first shot to an in­ten­sive care unit nurse.</p>
    <p>A 78-year-old woman liv­ing in a care home in Sevran, just out­side Paris, was the first per­son to re­ceive the im­mu­ni­sa­tion in France, lo­cal me­dia re­ported.</p>
    <p>French Pres­i­dent Em­manuel Macron cel­e­brated the news with a tweet: “We have a new weapon against the virus: the vac­cine. Con­tinue to stick to­gether.”</p>
    <p>The mu­tant vari­ant of the virus has ap­peared in coun­tries in­clud­ing Ger­many, Ja­pan, Aus­tralia, Sin­ga­pore and Italy. While that has spurred con­cern that test­ing, treat­ments and shots might not be as ef­fec­tive, of­fi­cials at BioNTech and the Euro­pean medicine reg­u­la­tor said they are op­ti­mistic the vac­cine will work against the new strain.</p>
    <p>The EU has or­dered 200 mil­lion doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech shot on be­half of mem­ber states, with an op­tion to ob­tain 100 mil­lion more, and the goal is to pro­vide ac­cess to all coun­tries at the same time on the ba­sis of pop­u­la­tion size.</p>
    <p>Sup­plies will be lim­ited in the early days. The EU may have enough vac­cine for two-thirds of its pop­u­la­tion in the mid­dle of Septem­ber next year, three months be­hind the US, ac­cord­ing to Lon­don­based re­search firm Airfin­ity.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, Rus­sia’s Pres­i­dent Vladimir Putin will re­ceive the Sput­nik V vac­cine against the coro­n­avirus, Krem­lin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told a Rus­sian state TV chan­nel yes­ter­day.</p>
