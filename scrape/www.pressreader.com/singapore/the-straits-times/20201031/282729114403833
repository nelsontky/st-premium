    <p>AN­TWERP • Tot­ten­ham man­ager Jose Mour­inho has said the dis­ap­point­ing per­for­mances of his fringe play­ers in Thurs­day’s 1-0 Europa League loss at Royal An­twerp would in­flu­ence his fu­ture team se­lec­tions, mak­ing it “very easy” to pick his first XI go­ing for­ward.</p>
    <p>The Por­tuguese made nine changes to the line-up from Mon­day’s 1-0 Premier League win at Burn­ley, but Spurs fell be­hind in­side 30 min­utes af­ter an er­ror from Ben Davies al­lowed Lior Re­faelov to score from close range.</p>
    <p>Dele Alli, Steven Berg­wijn, Gio­vani lo Celso and Car­los Vini­cius were all re­placed at half-time, but Spurs were un­able to get back on level terms in their Group J meet­ing de­spite the likes of Harry Kane and Son He­ung-min ap­pear­ing off the bench.</p>
    <p>It was their first de­feat since los­ing 1-0 to Everton on the Premier League’s open­ing week­end in Septem­ber, with Mour­inho hint­ing that some of his play­ers did not de­serve more game time.</p>
    <p>“I would like to have made 11 changes at half-time,” he told re­porters. “I didn’t make five as I was afraid of a long 45 min­utes.</p>
    <p>“I al­ways like to think the play­ers de­serve an op­por­tu­nity. We have a big squad with lots of good play­ers.</p>
    <p>“It’s my re­spon­si­bil­ity to give them op­por­tu­ni­ties but it’s also their op­por­tu­nity to catch the chance with both hands and ask for more.</p>
    <p>“Tonight shows my fu­ture choices are go­ing to be very easy.”</p>
    <p>In Group B, a flurry of goals ei­ther side of half-time from Ed­die Nke­tiah, Joe Wil­lock and Ni­co­las Pepe gave north London ri­vals Ar­se­nal a com­fort­able 3-0 Europa League win over Ir­ish side Dun­dalk at the Emi­rates.</p>
    <p>The vis­i­tors rarely man­aged to threaten a makeshift Gun­ners de­fence that saw mid­fielder Granit Xhaka fea­ture as a cen­tre-back, as the hosts main­tained their 100 per cent record in Europe.</p>
    <p>Un­like Mour­inho, Ar­se­nal coun­ter­part Mikel Arteta later claimed some of his play­ers had played their way into con­tention for to­mor­row’s Premier League game at Manch­ester United, say­ing they were “in the frame”.</p>
