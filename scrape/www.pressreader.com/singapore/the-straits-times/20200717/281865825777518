    <p>SEOUL • Seoul pros­e­cu­tors have opened an un­prece­dented probe into North Korean leader Kim Jong Un’s sis­ter over Py­ongyang’s blow­ing up of a li­ai­son of­fice last month, of­fi­cials said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The move is likely to in­fu­ri­ate the nu­clear-armed North, which has re­peat­edly con­demned South Korea in re­cent months, in­clud­ing di­rect­ing per­sonal in­sults at Pres­i­dent Moon Jae-in.</p>
    <p>Seoul Cen­tral District pros­e­cu­tors re­ceived a crim­i­nal com­plaint against Ms Kim Yo Jong from a Seoul-based lawyer and have started an in­ves­ti­ga­tion, a spokesman said.</p>
    <p>Last month, Py­ongyang blew up an in­ter-Korea li­ai­son of­fice on its side of the bor­der, days af­ter Ms Kim – who is one of her brother’s clos­est ad­vis­ers – had said the “use­less” prop­erty would soon be seen “com­pletely col­lapsed”.</p>
    <p>Be­fore the de­mo­li­tion, Py­ongyang had is­sued a se­ries of vit­ri­olic con­dem­na­tions of South Korea over anti-North leaflets that de­fec­tors send back across the heav­ily mil­i­tarised bor­der – usu­ally at­tached to bal­loons or floated in bot­tles.</p>
    <p>It raised pres­sure fur­ther by threat­en­ing mil­i­tary mea­sures against Seoul, but later said it had sus­pended those plans in an ap­par­ent sud­den di­alling-down of ten­sions.</p>
    <p>In his com­plaint, l awyer Lee Kyung-jae claimed the now-de­mol­ished li­ai­son of­fice was South Korean prop­erty as it was ren­o­vated us­ing South Korean gov­ern­ment funds, de­spite it be­ing lo­cated in the North.</p>
    <p>Ms Kim “used ex­plo­sives to de­stroy” the South’s “quasi-diplo­matic mis­sion build­ing that served the pub­lic in­ter­est”, he said in the com­plaint.</p>
    <p>Mr Lee also filed a com­plaint against Vice-Mar­shal Pak J ong Chon, chief of the gen­eral staff of the North Korean mil­i­tary.</p>
    <p>Un­der South Korea’s crim­i­nal code, he stressed, dam­ag­ing prop­erty or dis­turb­ing the peace us­ing ex­plo­sives was pun­ish­able by death, or a prison sen­tence of at least seven years.</p>
    <p>Cap­i­tal pun­ish­ment re­mains on the statute books in South Korea, al­though it has not ex­e­cuted any­one since 1997.</p>
    <p>In prac­tice, it would be vir­tu­ally im­pos­si­ble for Seoul of­fi­cials to pun­ish Ms Kim or Vice-Mar­shal Pak, but Mr Lee told the South’s Yonhap News Agency that he wanted to “in­form the North Korean peo­ple of their leader’s on him af­ter not hear­ing from him for a day, an­other law en­force­ment of­fi­cial said. De­tec­tives think that the as­sailant fled into the build­ing’s stair­well.</p>
    <p>A po­lice spokesman said he could not com­ment on how the killer en­tered the build­ing. The prop­erty’s man­age­ment com­pany said the build­ing did not have a door­man but had ex­ten­sive se­cu­rity in place.</p>
    <p>The man­age­ment com­pany, in a state­ment, said Mr Saleh was an ac­tive mem­ber of the con­do­minium board.</p>
    <p>On Tues­day, a law en­force­ment of­fi­cial said the elec­tric saw was still plugged into an elec­tri­cal out­let when the po­lice ar­rived, and the killer had left some clean­ing sup­plies be­hind. It ap­peared that some ef­fort had been made to clean up the ev­i­dence. hypocrisy” through the com­plaint.</p>
    <p>The an­nounce­ment came a week af­ter a Seoul court or­dered Py­ongyang’s leader to com­pen­sate pris­on­ers of war who spent decades in North Korea, in a move that could set a far-reach­ing le­gal prece­dent on the di­vided penin­sula.</p>
    <p>In­ter-Korea re­la­tions have been strained fol­low­ing the col­lapse of a sum­mit in Hanoi be­tween Mr Kim Jong Un and United States Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump early last year over what the nu­clear-armed North would be will­ing to give up in ex­change for a loos­en­ing of sanc­tions.</p>
    <p>The of­fi­cial who spoke on Wed­nes­day said the killing “looks like a pro­fes­sional job”, re­fer­ring to it as a “hit”.</p>
    <p>An­other po­lice spokesman said he could not com­ment on a pos­si­ble mo­tive or whether any sus­pects had been iden­ti­fied.</p>
    <p>Mr Saleh was CEO of mo­tor­cy­cle ride-hail­ing firm Gokada. The son of Bangladesh­i im­mi­grants who grew up near Pough­keep­sie, New York, he founded ride-hail­ing firms in Bangladesh and Nige­ria as well as a ven­ture cap­i­tal fund based in Man­hat­tan that in­vested largely in com­pa­nies in the de­vel­op­ing world.</p>
    <p>The law en­force­ment of­fi­cial said in­ves­ti­ga­tors were ex­plor­ing whether Mr Saleh’s killing might be re­lated to his busi­ness, not­ing the in­di­ca­tions that his com­pany had been hurt­ing.</p>
