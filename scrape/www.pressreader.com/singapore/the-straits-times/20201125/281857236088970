    <p>LON­DON • Eng­land will in­tro­duce a sys­tem on Dec 15 that lets pas­sen­gers ar­riv­ing from high­risk coun­tries take a Covid-19 test af­ter five days of quar­an­tine and be re­leased from fur­ther self-iso­la­tion if they test neg­a­tive.</p>
    <p>Air­lines and other firms in the travel and tourism in­dus­tries had been call­ing for such a scheme for months, hav­ing suf­fered dev­as­tat­ing con­se­quences from a 14-day quar­an­tine rule that has de­terred peo­ple from trav­el­ling.</p>
    <p>Eng­land’s lock­down bans most in­ter­na­tional travel but when it ends on Dec 2, peo­ple will be free to go abroad though they will still face re­stric­tions in their lo­cal area, Trans­port Min­is­ter Grant Shapps said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>“You can go abroad but... there’s a penalty to pay for that in terms of hav­ing a po­ten­tial quar­an­tine pe­riod when you come back,” he told BBC Ra­dio, when asked about the end of lock­down.</p>
    <p>The po­ten­tial for shorter quar­an­tine and more travel buoyed shares in Lon­don-listed travel com­pa­nies. The new scheme will ap­ply to pas­sen­gers from coun­tries not on the gov­ern­ment’s safe travel list, such as France, Italy, Spain and ma­jor des­ti­na­tions favoured by Bri­tish tourists.</p>
    <p>Peo­ple trav­el­ling to Eng­land by plane, ferry or train from Dec 15 and wish­ing to take ad­van­tage of the scheme must book a test with a pri­vate provider from a gov­ern­ment-ap­proved list. They will have to pay for their test.</p>
    <p>Wizz Air, which serves a hand­ful of Bri­tish air­ports, an­nounced a part­ner­ship with a test­ing com­pany to of­fer its pas­sen­gers cheaper tests, while Gatwick Air­port, Bri­tain’s No. 2 air­port, has set up a test­ing cen­tre.</p>
    <p>Sep­a­rately, the Euro­pean Union has reached a deal with US biotech firm Moderna for the sup­ply of its Covid-19 vac­cine can­di­date, Euro­pean Com­mis­sion pres­i­dent Ur­sula von der Leyen said yes­ter­day, adding it “al­lows us to buy up to 160 mil­lion doses of a vac­cine pro­duced by Moderna”.</p>
    <p>Last week, Moderna said its ex­per­i­men­tal vac­cine was 94.5 per cent ef­fec­tive i n pre­vent­ing Covid-19, based on in­terim data from a late-stage clin­i­cal trial.</p>
