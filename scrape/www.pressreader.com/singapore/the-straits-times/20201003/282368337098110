    <p>Malaysia Avi­a­tion Group, the hold­ing com­pany for Malaysia Air­lines, said in a let­ter to lessors that the group is un­likely to be able to make pay­ments owed af­ter next month un­less it re­ceives more fund­ing from state fund Khaz­anah Na­sional.</p>
    <p>The let­ter, re­viewed by Reuters, fol­lows a re­quest by the trou­bled car­rier for steep dis­counts on air­craft rentals from its lessors as part of a broad re­struc­tur­ing plan, three sources with knowl­edge of the mat­ter said.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to the let­ter, the avi­a­tion group was ex­pe­ri­enc­ing “an av­er­age monthly op­er­at­ing cash burn of US$84 mil­lion (S$114.6 mil­lion)”, but had only US$88 mil­lion in liq­uid­ity as at Aug 31 and an ad­di­tional US$139 mil­lion avail­able from Khaz­anah, its sole share­holder.</p>
    <p>“Based on the cur­rent run rate, ab­sent fur­ther fund­ing from share­hold­ers, the group will likely be un­able to meet its obli­ga­tions, in­clud­ing pay­ments to lessors, post-Novem­ber 2020,” it said.</p>
    <p>The let­ter was sent last month, but the ex­act date was not im­me­di­ately clear.</p>
    <p>Malaysia Avi­a­tion Group and Khaz­anah had no im­me­di­ate com­ment.</p>
    <p>Malaysia’s na­tional air­line has strug­gled to re­cover from two tragedies in 2014 – the dis­ap­pear­ance of flight MH370 and the shoot­ing down of flight MH17 over east­ern Ukraine.</p>
    <p>Khaz­anah took it pri­vate that year as part of a US$1.5 bil­lion re­struc­tur­ing.</p>
