    <p>TAIPEI • A three-year-old girl in Tai­wan sur­vived af­ter be­ing launched into the air for a ter­ri­fy­ing halfminute flight when she was en­snared in the tail of a kite.</p>
    <p>Dra­matic footage cap­tured the girl’s or­deal at a weekend fes­ti­val in Hs­inchu city in north-western Tai­wan. A sud­den gust of wind at the site, which is known for its strong winds, caused the kite’s tail to wrap around the child’s waist.</p>
    <p>Hor­ri­fied spec­ta­tors screamed as the girl was cat­a­pulted high above them, where she was spun help­lessly at the end of the kite’s long orange streamer.</p>
    <p>It took some 30 sec­onds be­fore the girl’s night­mare ended and she was pulled back to the ground by mem­bers of the crowd as the kite was brought back un­der con­trol.</p>
    <p>Hs­inchu Mayor Lin Chih-chien said the girl suf­fered scratches to her face and was ter­ri­fied by the or­deal, but was oth­er­wise un­harmed. “The city govern­ment ex­presses its deep­est apolo­gies to the girl and the pub­lic,” he said on Face­book.</p>
    <p>A 34-year-old man, iden­ti­fied by his fam­ily name Lin, told the Ap­ple Daily that he helped reel the girl back to land when the kite’s tail dipped l ow enough. “At first I thought it was some kind of a stunt show... then I j ust thought (we) can’t let the kid fall,” he said.</p>
