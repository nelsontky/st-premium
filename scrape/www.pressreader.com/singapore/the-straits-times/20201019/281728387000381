    <p>The In­done­sian hol­i­day is­land of Batam is gear­ing up to wel­come trav­ellers from Sin­ga­pore again, af­ter both coun­tries for­mally agreed to re­sume cross-bor­der travel for es­sen­tial busi­ness and of­fi­cial pur­poses.</p>
    <p>Prepa­ra­tions are be­ing made to in­stall equip­ment to run poly­merase chain re­ac­tion tests at the Batam Cen­tre ferry ter­mi­nal, which has been des­ig­nated as an en­try and exit point for sea travel. Jakarta’s Soekarno-Hatta In­ter­na­tional Air­port will cater to air trav­ellers.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore and In­done­sia last Mon­day is­sued a joint state­ment an­nounc­ing a re­cip­ro­cal green lane for travel be­tween the two coun­tries. Ap­pli­ca­tions will be­gin on Oct 26, and travel will com­mence soon af­ter.</p>
    <p>Act­ing Batam Mayor Syam­sul Bahrum said: “We have made a sim­u­la­tion of the ar­rival pro­ce­dures for trav­ellers, from dis­em­bark­ing from the ves­sel, to tak­ing the swab test, and be­ing taken to their re­spec­tive ho­tels.”</p>
    <p>He added that of­fi­cials from the Min­istry of Health and the Min­istry of For­eign Af­fairs from Jakarta are ex­pected to go to the is­land be­fore Oct 26 to run through the pro­ce­dures.</p>
    <p>Be­sides or­der­ing pub­lic ar­eas and fa­cil­i­ties to be cleaned, and handrails at the port area to be re­painted, he also asked for clear signs in English to be put up to help trav­ellers.</p>
    <p>Ap­pli­cants for the green lane, re­ferred to as a travel cor­ri­dor ar­range­ment, or TCA, in In­done­sia, must be In­done­sian cit­i­zens, or Sin­ga­pore cit­i­zens or per­ma­nent res­i­dents.</p>
    <p>Among other re­quire­ments, those from Sin­ga­pore must have spon­sor­ship from an In­done­sian gov­ern­ment or busi­ness en­tity, and should have ap­plied for a visa on­line through In­done­sia’s direc­torate-gen­eral of im­mi­gra­tion.</p>
    <p>Those from In­done­sia must be spon­sored by a Sin­ga­pore gov­ern­ment agency or an en­ter­prise in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>Pre-de­par­ture and post-ar­rival Covid-19 swab tests from mu­tu­ally recog­nised health in­sti­tu­tions will also be re­quired.</p>
    <p>The news of the cross-bor­der re­lax­ation brought much cheer to Batam, a pop­u­lar week­end get­away for Sin­ga­pore­ans be­fore the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Only a 45-minute ferry ride away from Sin­ga­pore, Batam and its sur­round­ing is­lands in the Riau Is­lands province had been badly hit eco­nom­i­cally by bor­der clo­sures, which left malls de­serted, and many shops and restau­rants shut­tered in the past seven months.</p>
    <p>Batam Cen­tre in­ter­na­tional ferry port op­er­a­tions man­ager Nika Astaga told The Straits Times that the port served around 5,000 trav­ellers from Sin­ga­pore and Malaysia daily be­fore the pan­demic, with the num­bers hit­ting 15,000 dur­ing week­ends and peak hol­i­day sea­sons.</p>
    <p>He had been told by the lo­cal au­thor­i­ties to be pre­pared to han­dle around 300 pas­sen­gers from Sin­ga­pore dur­ing the first month once the green lane comes into ef­fect.</p>
    <p>“The num­ber is not sig­nif­i­cant, but for the ini­tial stage, we are happy. This is a good sign, like an oa­sis in the desert for us who have suf­fered losses for seven months,” he added.</p>
    <p>Around 10 ho­tels on the is­land have so far been iden­ti­fied to re­ceive trav­ellers from Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>One of the ho­tels, Asialink Ho­tel Batam by Pras­an­thi, said it has re­ceived book­ings for two rooms for af­ter Oct 26 from Sin­ga­pore­ans since the green lane was an­nounced.</p>
    <p>The ho­tel’s gen­eral man­ager Ari­nis, who goes by only one name, told The Straits Times that guests will be served meals at pro­mo­tional prices while wait­ing for re­sults of the swab tests.</p>
    <p>As a health pre­cau­tion, keys with only one-time ac­cess will be given to guests. If they leave the room with­out per­mis­sion while wait­ing for the re­sults and are locked out, they will be re­ported to the au­thor­i­ties.</p>
    <p>Rooms will also be sim­ply fur­nished, with room dec­o­ra­tions re­moved to min­imise sur­faces be­ing touched and the spread of the coro­n­avirus, he added.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore has been In­done­sia’s top in­vestor since 2014, with re­alised in­vest­ment val­ued at US$6.5 bil­lion (S$8.8 bil­lion) last year. Sin­ga­pore is also In­done­sia’s third­largest trad­ing part­ner, while In­done­sia is Sin­ga­pore’s sixth-largest trad­ing part­ner, with bi­lat­eral trade hav­ing in­creased by 9.4 per cent year on year to reach $65 bil­lion in 2018.</p>
    <p>In­done­sia has the high­est num­ber of coro­n­avirus cases and deaths in South-east Asia, with a to­tal of 361,867 cases as at yes­ter­day, in­clud­ing 12,511 deaths.</p>
