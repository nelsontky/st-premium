    <p>In its lat­est an­nual re­port, called the Te­masek Re­view, Te­masek re­ported a one-year to­tal share­holder re­turn of mi­nus 2.3 per cent for the year ended March 31, 2020. While this seems a dis­ap­point­ing per­for­mance, it needs to be viewed in per­spec­tive. First, it re­flects in part the ex­cep­tion­ally sharp cor­rec­tion in fi­nan­cial mar­kets in March, as the im­pact of the Covid-19 pan­demic be­gan to be priced in, and stock prices de­clined by 25 to 30 per cent in most G-20 coun­tries. Mar­kets have since bounced back and Te­masek’s one-year re­turn would al­most cer­tainly be in pos­i­tive ter­ri­tory if mea­sured now.</p>
    <p>But that is­sue aside, it is im­por­tant not to be dis­tracted by the sin­gle-year per­for­mance of a longterm in­vestor such as Te­masek. This should also ap­ply to years in which it has pro­duced out­size pos­i­tive per­for­mances, such as in 2010 and 2015, dur­ing which the re­turns were 43 per cent and 19.2 per cent, re­spec­tively. As most of Te­masek’s in­vest­ments are in eq­ui­ties as op­posed to fixed­in­come in­stru­ments, year-on-year re­turns are bound to be volatile. What mat­ters is its per­for­mance over the long term. Over the last 10 years, Te­masek’s an­nual re­turns have been 5 per cent and its div­i­dend in­come has av­er­aged $8 bil­lion a year, in­clud­ing $12 bil­lion in 2020 – a rea­son­able show­ing in the near-zero in­ter­est rate en­vi­ron­ment that has pre­vailed for most of that pe­riod.</p>
    <p>Te­masek’s long-term fo­cus is ev­i­dent in the na­ture of some of its in­vest­ments, as re­vealed in its an­nual re­port. There is a strong em­pha­sis on struc­tural trends that can be ex­pected to pro­duce growth far into the fu­ture such as dig­i­tal pay­ments, ar­ti­fi­cial in­tel­li­gence, the bio-sciences, in­no­va­tive drug de­vel­op­ment, sus­tain­able foods and sus­tain­able en­ergy. Many of these in­vest­ments are con­sis­tent with en­vi­ron­men­tal, so­cial and gov­er­nance con­sid­er­a­tions, which sug­gest that Te­masek has shifted its in­vest­ment mind­set in­creas­ingly to­wards “im­pact in­vest­ments” which yield ben­e­fi­cial so­cial and en­vi­ron­men­tal out­comes, yet pro­duce good re­turns. Another high­light of this year’s an­nual re­port is that for the first time, the value of Te­masek’s in­vest­ments in China ex­ceeds the value of those in Singapore. This partly re­flects the greater ap­pre­ci­a­tion of val­u­a­tions in China over the past year. It might also re­flect the ex­pand­ing in­vest­ment op­por­tu­ni­ties in China.</p>
    <p>Whereas Te­masek’s early in­vest­ments were con­cen­trated in banks, it has now piv­oted to ar­eas such as data so­lu­tions, video plat­forms, high­speed rail, lo­gis­tics and phar­ma­ceu­ti­cals, which are among the rel­a­tively new, dy­namic sec­tors in the Chi­nese econ­omy. But while China war­rants sub­stan­tial in­vest­ments from any long-term in­vestor, Te­masek will need to be in­creas­ingly mind­ful of China-re­lated risks, in­clud­ing the US-China trade war, dis­rupt­ing sup­ply chains, frag­ment­ing tech­nolo­gies and a pos­si­ble eco­nomic slow­down.</p>
