    <p>• It was per­haps the most an­tic­i­pated Satur­day Night Live (SNL) sea­son pre­miere i n al­most 20 years – the com­edy sketch show’s first live broad­cast in more than six months, hosted by co­me­dian Chris Rock, and its first to be pro­duced un­der the new guide­lines of the coro­n­avirus era.</p>
    <p>SNL tends to gen­er­ate its big­gest au­di­ences in Amer­i­can pres­i­den­tial elec­tion years, and the se­ries’ cre­ator, Lorne Michaels, fur­ther stoked ex­pec­ta­tions by tap­ping ac­tor Jim Car­rey to play for­mer United States vice-pres­i­dent Joe Bi­den, the Demo­cratic nom­i­nee.</p>
    <p>Last Satur­day’s seg­ment opened with a voice-over promis­ing a re­play of last Tues­day’s pres­i­den­tial de­bate, “even though Tues­day feels like 100 days ago”.</p>
    <p>On stage, ac­tor Beck Ben­nett played the hap­less mod­er­a­tor, Chris Wal­lace of Fox News, while ac­tor Alec Bald­win re­turned to his re­cur­ring role as US Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump.</p>
    <p>Ben­nett be­gan to ex­plain the rules.</p>
    <p>“Each can­di­date will have two minutes, un­in­ter­rupted,” he said, only to be i mme­di­ately in­ter­rupted by Bald­win.</p>
    <p>“Bor­ing!” Bald­win de­clared. Asked if he had taken the test for coro­n­avirus, Bald­win an­swered: “Ab­so­lutely. Scout’s hon­our.”</p>
    <p>Play­ing Mr Bi­den for the first time, Car­rey strode onto the stage</p>
    <p>in avi­a­tor glasses while mak­ing fin­ger guns at the au­di­ence. He pro­duced a tape mea­sure, sized up the dis­tance be­tween him­self and Bald­win, then picked up his lectern and moved it fur­ther away.</p>
    <p>Asked if he was ready to de­bate, Car­rey an­swered: “Ab­so­lutely not. But I’ve got the be­gin­ning of 46 fan­tas­tic ideas I may or may not have ac­cess to. Now let’s do this. I’m hold­ing my blad­der.”</p>
    <p>Through­out the seg­ment, Car­rey (as Mr Bi­den) tried to ex­er­cise some re­straint: “Don’t let your in­ner Whitey Bul­ger come out,” he told him­self. “Flash that smile they taught you in anger man­age­ment.”</p>
    <p>Ben­nett, mean­while, em­pha­sised Wal­lace’s pas­siv­ity. At one point, he</p>
    <p>told Bald­win: “Mr Pres­i­dent, if you keep in­ter­rupt­ing this de­bate, I’ll do ab­so­lutely noth­ing about it.”</p>
    <p>Ac­tress Maya Ru­dolph ap­peared briefly in her re­cur­ring role as Se­na­tor Ka­mala Har­ris, the Demo­cratic vice-pres­i­den­tial nom­i­nee.</p>
    <p>Bald­win (as Mr Trump) de­murred on the topic of white supremacy, Car­rey pro­duced a re­mote con­trol and paused Bald­win in mid-sen­tence.</p>
    <p>“Sorry, but I think we all needed a break,” Car­rey said. “Isn’t that sat­is­fy­ing?”</p>
    <p>Be­fore he, Bald­win and Ru­dolph ended the sketch, Car­rey’s Mr Bi­den in­tro­duced his own cam­paign slo­gan: “Make Amer­ica Ac­tively Not on Fire Again.”</p>
