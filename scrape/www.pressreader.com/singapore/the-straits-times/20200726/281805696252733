    <p>The Sin­ga­pore Med­i­cal Coun­cil (SMC) is de­cid­ing whether to bring dis­ci­plinary pro­ceed­ings against gen­eral prac­ti­tioner Wee Teong Boo, who, by his own ad­mis­sion, had in­serted un­gloved fin­gers into a fe­male pa­tient dur­ing a sup­posed pelvic ex­am­i­na­tion.</p>
    <p>This is de­spite the fact that the Court of Ap­peal cleared him of all charges last month.</p>
    <p>The SMC also said Dr Wee, who was sus­pended from prac­tice af­ter his ini­tial con­vic­tion by the High Court last year, has not reap­plied for a prac­tis­ing cer­tifi­cate.</p>
    <p>It has ob­tained a signed un­der­tak­ing from him to con­duct all clin­i­cal ex­am­i­na­tions in ac­cor­dance with the eth­i­cal guide­lines it set out for all doc­tors in 2016, in the event that he is al­lowed to prac­tise again pend­ing the out­come of the SMC dis­ci­plinary process.</p>
    <p>It said on Fri­day: “The SMC is study­ing the court’s judg­ment to de­ter­mine its next ac­tions in re­la­tion to Dr Wee’s pro­fes­sional con­duct. In con­duct­ing any clin­i­cal ex­am­i­na­tion, in­clud­ing in­ter­nal pelvic ex­am­i­na­tions, he shall en­sure the pres­ence of a chap­er­one and the use of gloves, and proper lu­bri­cant in the con­duct of any such ex­am­i­na­tions.”</p>
    <p>The 69-year-old doc­tor had been ac­cused of mo­lest­ing a 23-year-old stu­dent at his Be­dok clinic dur­ing an ex­am­i­na­tion in Novem­ber 2015, and of rap­ing her when she vis­ited the clinic again a month later.</p>
    <p>He was ini­tially con­victed of sex­ual as­sault and molestatio­n by a High Court judge last year and sen­tenced to 10 years’ jail.</p>
    <p>The de­ci­sion of the Court of Ap­peal to over­turn his con­vic­tion led to the lift­ing of his sus­pen­sion or­der on July 16. The or­der had ear­lier been ob­tained by the SMC on the ba­sis of his High Court con­vic­tion.</p>
    <p>The SMC said Dr Wee’s signed un­der­tak­ing was com­pleted on July 12, four days be­fore the sus­pen­sion or­der was lifted.</p>
    <p>“As de­lib­er­a­tions are un­der way on whether dis­ci­plinary pro­ceed­ings are to be brought against Dr Wee, the SMC seeks the pub­lic’s un­der­stand­ing that it is un­able to com­ment at this junc­ture so as to avoid prej­u­dic­ing any such pro­ceed­ings,” it said.</p>
    <p>Doc­tors can ap­ply for a new prac­tis­ing cer­tifi­cate as long as a sus­pen­sion or­der is lifted, among other con­di­tions.</p>
    <p>In ac­quit­ting Dr Wee of the rape and molestatio­n charges, the apex court said the wo­man’s tes­ti­mony was un­con­vinc­ing. It found it “in­cred­i­ble” that she ini­tially be­lieved Dr Wee’s ac­tions, such as touch­ing her gen­i­tal area when she went to see him for gas­tric dis­com­fort, were part of the ex­am­i­na­tion.</p>
    <p>It also said it was im­plau­si­ble that Dr Wee would rape the pa­tient given that there were clinic as­sis­tants and other pa­tients in the clinic.</p>
    <p>The court also over­turned his sex­ual as­sault con­vic­tion, as the trial had been con­ducted on a rape charge, not on sex­ual as­sault. It meant that Dr Wee had not had the chance to de­fend him­self against the sex­ual as­sault charge which he was con­victed of.</p>
    <p>The SMC said Dr Wee, who was sus­pended from prac­tice af­ter his ini­tial con­vic­tion by the High Court last year, has not reap­plied for a prac­tis­ing cer­tifi­cate.</p>
