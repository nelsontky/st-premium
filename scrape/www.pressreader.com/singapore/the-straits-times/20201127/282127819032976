    <p>A man re­peat­edly abused his fam­ily’s do­mes­tic helper, such as by slap­ping the woman’s face and splash­ing hot wa­ter on her.</p>
    <p>As a re­sult, Ms San Pa Pa, who is from Myan­mar, suf­fered a scald.</p>
    <p>Un­able to tol­er­ate any more abuse from James Ong Teck Keong, the 24-year-old woman tried to kill her­self in 2017 by at­tempt­ing to jump from the cor­ri­dor of her em­ployer’s home on the ninth storey of a Jurong West block of flats.</p>
    <p>She had to be re­strained by Ong’s wife Lee Bee Li and an­other maid, Ms Htay Win, who worked in the same block.</p>
    <p>Deputy Pub­lic Pros­e­cu­tors An­dre Chong and Bene­dict Teong said in their submission­s that po­lice later in­ves­ti­gated the in­ci­dent and dis­cov­ered the abuse.</p>
    <p>A district court found Ong guilty yes­ter­day of four counts of as­sault­ing Ms San Pa Pa. The 48-year-old Sin­ga­porean was also con­victed of one count of com­mit­ting a rash act by throw­ing a filled wa­ter bot­tle at her.</p>
    <p>Ms San Pa Pa started work­ing for his fam­ily in Au­gust 2014.</p>
    <p>The pros­e­cu­tors said: “A year into her em­ploy­ment... the ac­cused was un­happy with her qual­ity of work and started to phys­i­cally abuse her. Be­tween late 2015 and 2016, the ac­cused slapped the vic­tim on her face three times... He also rashly threw a filled wa­ter bot­tle at her in anger.”</p>
    <p>Some time in late 2016, Ong had a dis­pute with the maid over the tem­per­a­ture of some wa­ter used to make his son’s milk.</p>
    <p>He then splashed hot wa­ter on her waist and left arm. She suf­fered a burn wound on her waist and was un­able to shower or sleep prop­erly for two weeks.</p>
    <p>The court heard that on July 13, 2017, Ong came home in anger af­ter Madam Lee re­peat­edly called him, say­ing the maid had taken a packet of milk pow­der with­out per­mis­sion. The DPPs said Ong scolded the maid so loudly that Ms Htay Win, who worked two floors up, could hear him.</p>
    <p>Ms San Pa Pa tried to kill her­self the next day af­ter Madam Lee lec­tured her. The maid was re­strained and taken to a po­lice sta­tion. The DPPs said she has since left Sin­ga­pore. Ong’s bail was set at $3,000 yes­ter­day and he will be sen­tenced on Jan 7 next year.</p>
