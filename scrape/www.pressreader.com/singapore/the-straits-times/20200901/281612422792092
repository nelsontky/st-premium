    <p>Sin­ga­pore Premier League (SPL) clubs will be able to re­sume full train­ing amid strict pro­to­col from to­day af­ter work­ing out in groups of five with no con­tact since June 20. The Foot­ball As­so­ci­a­tion of Sin­ga­pore an­nounced the eas­ing of mea­sures yes­ter­day but has not set a date for the re­sump­tion of the league, which was sus­pended on March 24.</p>
    <p>Tan­jong Pa­gar United cap­tain Faritz Hameed and his team­mates were ex­cited to re­turn to the pitch again in late June, as phase two of Sin­ga­pore’s re­open­ing dur­ing the Covid-19 pan­demic saw the re­lax­ing of some so­cial dis­tanc­ing mea­sures.</p>
    <p>But the mod­i­fied train­ing reg­i­mens – in groups of five with no con­tact al­lowed – soon be­came “te­dious and bor­ing” and the foot­ballers were itch­ing to re­sume play in the then-sus­pended Sin­ga­pore Premier League (SPL).</p>
    <p>They fi­nally re­ceived lon­gawaited news yes­ter­day as the Foot­ball As­so­ci­a­tion of Sin­ga­pore (FAS) an­nounced that full train­ing for SPL teams would be al­lowed from to­day, of­fer­ing play­ers and coaches a glim­mer of hope.</p>
    <p>Faritz, 30, said: “We’ve been wait­ing for this day to come. We un­der­stand that it’s a step by step process and we know that things have to set­tle down first.</p>
    <p>“Two months (of train­ing in small groups) can be quite te­dious and bor­ing, but it was ben­e­fi­cial and hope­fully we can put what­ever we’ve learnt into our games.”</p>
    <p>While no fixed date has been set for the re­sump­tion of the league, the FAS is look­ing at a ten­ta­tive restart this month. The SPL kicked off on Feb 29 but was of­fi­cially sus­pended on March 24 ow­ing to the coro­n­avirus pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Hougang United coach Cle­ment Teo wel­comed the news, but he stressed the im­por­tance of stick­ing to safety mea­sures.</p>
    <p>“It feels (like) we’ve been train­ing with five in a group for the long­est time so this is good news,” said the 54-year-old.</p>
    <p>“Nat­u­rally we’re glad, but ul­ti­mately we need to be very cau­tious about this.”</p>
    <p>When full train­ing be­gins, there will be reg­u­lar breaks to al­low play­ers and staff to sani­tise their hands and make sure that they are prop­erly hy­drated.</p>
    <p>With the ex­cep­tion of goal­keep­ers, any han­dling or us­age of equip­ment is to be kept to a min­i­mum.</p>
    <p>Phys­i­cal con­tact should be min­imised and drills such as those for head­ing that re­quire play­ers to pick up and toss the ball to an­other are not en­cour­aged.</p>
    <p>Chang­ing rooms and gyms will stay closed and the shar­ing of per­sonal equip­ment be­tween play­ers, coaches and of­fi­cials is not al­lowed.</p>
    <p>Af­ter five months with­out any com­pet­i­tive games, Tampines Rovers winger Jordan Webb is ready to get back onto the foot­ball pitch.</p>
    <p>The 32-year-old was in his na­tive Canada from April to early July, when he was able to train in groups of 10.</p>
    <p>He re­sumed train­ing with the Stags in late July af­ter serv­ing his quar­an­tine or­der.</p>
    <p>“I miss in­ter­act­ing with my team­mates, play­ing ac­tual games and that feel­ing you have when you win a game,” he said.</p>
    <p>PRO­CEED WITH CAU­TION</p>
    <p>It feels (like) we’ve been train­ing with five in a group for the long­est time so this is good news. Nat­u­rally we’re glad, but ul­ti­mately we need</p>
    <p>to be very cau­tious.</p>
    <p>“I feel ex­cited. We’re eager to start play­ing and do­ing what we love to do.”</p>
    <p>Fans may have to wait even longer to get back into the sta­dium.</p>
    <p>Gey­lang In­ter­na­tional sup­porter Rishi Raja, who has been an Ea­gles fan for a decade, was thrilled to hear the news but the 31-year-old said he is “not go­ing to be full of hope that we can go down and watch if it does restart”.</p>
    <p>As SPL teams gear up in the com­ing weeks for a pos­si­ble re­turn of league games, Teo ad­mit­ted that the sea­son would be tough on teams af­ter the long lay­off.</p>
    <p>He said: “Even though we push them on fit­ness and do many fit­ness drills, it’s when you play games that fit­ness comes in.”</p>
    <p>Be­fore the coro­n­avirus-en­forced break, Tampines led the nine-team ta­ble with nine points from four games. Hold­ers Brunei DPMM were sixth on three points from win­ning their only game of the sea­son.</p>
