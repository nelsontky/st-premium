    <p>Two newly con­firmed Covid-19 cases were linked to 55 pre­vi­ous cases to form a new clus­ter at Sungei Ten­gah Lodge, which was closed as a clus­ter a month ago, the Min­istry of Health (MOH) said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The dor­mi­tory in Old Choa Chu Kang Road was pre­vi­ously one of the biggest and ear­li­est clus­ters among dorms here, with 2,203 con­firmed cases be­fore it was closed as a clus­ter on July 21.</p>
    <p>It is Sin­ga­pore’s largest dorm, hous­ing about 16,000 work­ers.</p>
    <p>The two cases were among 50 new coro­n­avirus cases con­firmed here yes­ter­day, in­clud­ing two un­linked com­mu­nity cases and five im­ported cases.</p>
    <p>One of the com­mu­nity cases was a 56-year-old Sin­ga­porean woman who works at the In­sti­tute of Tech­ni­cal Ed­u­ca­tion (ITE) Col­lege Cen­tral. She was de­tected un­der MOH’s en­hanced com­mu­nity test­ing to test all in­di­vid­u­als aged 13 and above di­ag­nosed with acute res­pi­ra­tory in­fec­tion at first pre­sen­ta­tion to a doc­tor. She had gone to work after the on­set of symp­toms on Wednes­day and tested pos­i­tive on Fri­day.</p>
    <p>The other was a 63-year-old Sin­ga­porean woman who was tested on ad­mis­sion to a hos­pi­tal for another med­i­cal con­di­tion. She had symp­toms on Thurs­day and tested pos­i­tive on Fri­day.</p>
    <p>Epi­demi­o­log­i­cal in­ves­ti­ga­tions of the cases are in progress, MOH said, and all iden­ti­fied close con­tacts have been iso­lated and quar­an­tined.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, Korean BBQ restau­rant Teng Sheng and the Koufu food court at ITE Col­lege Cen­tral were added to the list of places Covid-19 pa­tients vis­ited while still in­fec­tious, along­side Pap­paMia Sin­ga­pore at Changi Air­port and Cold Stor­age su­per­mar­ket at West Mall.</p>
