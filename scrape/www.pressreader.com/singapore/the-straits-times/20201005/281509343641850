    <p>Madam Kirti Har­nal had j ust cooked a meal at home one Satur­day in Novem­ber 2018 when she sud­denly felt fa­tigued.</p>
    <p>The 60-year-old lec­turer at the Sin­ga­pore In­sti­tute of Man­age­ment also had some pain in her shoul­ders, but thought it was due to her long hours us­ing the com­puter.</p>
    <p>But her fam­ily felt she should seek med­i­cal help, so they took her to the Na­tional Univer­sity Hos­pi­tal, where she found out she was ac­tu­ally hav­ing a heart at­tack.</p>
    <p>One of her ar­ter­ies was 95 per cent blocked while an­other two were 60 and 40 per cent blocked.</p>
    <p>Two days later, she un­der­went a stent surgery, which in­volved in­sert­ing a tiny tube into a clogged artery to al­low blood to flow freely.</p>
    <p>Madam Har­nal, who has two sons aged 35 and 32, said: “I was shocked be­cause I main­tained a healthy diet. I most def­i­nitely didn’t think that I’d get a heart at­tack.”</p>
    <p>Like her, many women do not think they are at risk of a heart at­tack. But car­dio­vas­cu­lar dis­ease, associated with a build-up of fatty de­posits in the ar­ter­ies and an in­creased risk of blood clots, was the l ead­ing cause of death for women here last year, ac­cord­ing to a check of the Reg­istry of Births and Deaths.</p>
    <p>Only 9 per cent of the 1,002 women aged 21 to 64 sur­veyed by the Sin­ga­pore Heart Foun­da­tion (SHF) be­tween Jan­uary and March this year knew this fact.</p>
    <p>In con­junc­tion with World Heart Day on Sept 29 and Restart A Heart</p>
    <p>Day on Oct 16, SHF, a so­cial ser­vice agency, or­gan­ised talks on women’s heart health along with other top­ics over the week­end.</p>
    <p>Com­mon car­dio­vas­cu­lar dis­eases in­clude coro­nary heart dis­ease, which causes heart at­tack and heart fail­ure; and carotid artery dis­ease, where blood sup­ply to the brain is dis­rupted, re­sult­ing in stroke, brain dam­age and death.</p>
    <p>The SHF sur­vey, ti­tled Go Red For Women, also found that 34 per cent of re­spon­dents be­lieve that breast can­cer is their big­gest health threat. But ac­tu­ally, car­dio­vas­cu­lar dis­ease claimed the lives of 2,689 women here last year, while breast can­cer caused 445 deaths.</p>
    <p>Dr Goh Ping Ping, a car­di­ol­o­gist at Mount El­iz­a­beth Hos­pi­tal, noted that women, es­pe­cially those who are younger, tend to over­look the dan­ger of heart dis­ease.</p>
    <p>Can­cer di­ag­noses are “more com­monly heard of and ap­pear more sin­is­ter”, she said.</p>
    <p>“But the fact is, heart dis­ease kills six times as many women ev­ery year and can lead to de­bil­i­tat­ing con­di­tions such as heart fail­ure.”</p>
    <p>Dr Ro­hit Khu­rana, a senior con­sul­tant car­di­ol­o­gist with Har­ley Street Heart and Vas­cu­lar Cen­tre at Gle­nea­gles Hos­pi­tal, said there is “an un­for­tu­nate lack of aware­ness” of car­dio­vas­cu­lar dis­ease in women not only among fe­male pa­tients, but also among health­care pro­fes­sion­als.</p>
    <p>This may be due to an un­der­rep­re­sen­ta­tion of women in heart dis­ease re­search, he said, with women mak­ing up only 30 per cent of par­tic­i­pants in most stud­ies and tri­als.</p>
    <p>“Gen­der dif­fer­ences in the symp­tom pre­sen­ta­tion re­sult in women hav­ing longer de­lays in recog­ni­tion, in­ves­ti­ga­tion and, ul­ti­mately, treat­ment for their heart con­di­tion.</p>
    <p>“This com­bi­na­tion of in­ad­e­quate re­search and lack of ex­am­i­na­tion widens the gap in knowl­edge about car­dio­vas­cu­lar dis­ease in women, in­creas­ing the risk of de­layed treat­ment and a poorer over­all prog­no­sis among fe­male pa­tients.”</p>
    <p>The main risk fac­tors for car­dio­vas­cu­lar dis­ease in­clude high blood pres­sure, high blood choles­terol, di­a­betes, smok­ing, phys­i­cal in­ac­tiv­ity, obe­sity or be­ing over­weight and a fam­ily his­tory of the dis­ease.</p>
    <p>Apart from chest pain, which can hit both men and women, the symp­toms of a heart at­tack more com­mon in women are neck, jaw or shoul­der pain, short­ness of breath, nau­sea, feel­ings of in­di­ges­tion and fa­tigue.</p>
    <p>These symp­toms may not be as no­tice­able as the crush­ing chest pain associated with heart at­tacks. This might be be­cause women are more likely to have block­ages in the tiny ves­sels within the heart rather than the large ar­ter­ies – a con­di­tion called small ves­sel heart dis­ease.</p>
    <p>Madam Har­nal, for ex­am­ple, did not think her sud­den fa­tigue could mean a heart at­tack as she did not have se­vere pain in her chest, un­like her father, who ex­pe­ri­enced that as well as strong pain in his left arm when he had a heart at­tack in his 30s. He sur­vived the at­tack.</p>
    <p>Dr Khu­rana said women also tend to have “silent” heart at­tacks which have no symp­toms at all.</p>
    <p>“This may be due to women hav­ing un­der­ly­ing con­di­tions such as di­a­betes which may bring about numb­ness or a re­duced abil­ity to feel pain,” he added.</p>
    <p>Dr Goh said the risk of heart dis­ease in women in­creases af­ter menopause due to a drop in the fe­male hor­mone oe­stro­gen.</p>
    <p>“Oe­stro­gen is be­lieved to have a good ef­fect on the in­ner layer of artery wall, help­ing to keep blood ves­sels flex­i­ble to ac­com­mo­date blood flow. Oe­stro­gen also has a pro­tec­tive ef­fect against hy­per­ten­sion and high choles­terol,” she said.</p>
    <p>Af­ter menopause, women ex­pe­ri­ence lower lev­els of good choles­terol and higher lev­els of bad choles­terol, which in­crease their risk of car­dio­vas­cu­lar dis­ease and ath­er­o­scle­ro­sis – the build-up of fats, choles­terol and other sub­stances in and on the artery walls, which can re­strict blood flow.</p>
    <p>Re­tired data en­try clerk Cheah Aek Hong, whose mother died of heart dis­ease more than 50 years ago, did not pay much at­ten­tion to her diet and hardly ex­er­cised. The 65-year-old of­ten felt tired quickly and would feel breath­less af­ter climb­ing a short flight of stairs.</p>
    <p>A check with the doc­tor showed that she had mi­tral steno­sis – a con­di­tion where there is a nar­row­ing of the mi­tral valve that blocks blood flow to the heart.</p>
    <p>She un­der­went surgery in Fe­bru­ary last year at the Sin­ga­pore Gen­eral Hos­pi­tal (SGH) to re­place the en­tire valve with a me­chan­i­cal one.</p>
    <p>This was fol­lowed by ther­apy ses­sions at the hos­pi­tal and re­ha­bil­i­ta­tion un­der SHF’s Heart Well­ness Pro­gramme at the Heart Well­ness Cen­tre at For­tune Cen­tre where she learnt to do sim­ple ex­er­cises and got ad­vice on nu­tri­tion.</p>
    <p>Madam Cheah, who has two chil­dren, aged 32 and 29, says she watches her diet more closely now.</p>
    <p>Like­wise, Madam Har­nal hardly ex­er­cised in the past but now takes walks in the park and does sim­ple ex­er­cises at home with light weights.</p>
    <p>She has also un­der­gone re­ha­bil­i­ta­tion at the SHF Heart Well­ness Cen­tre in Bukit Gom­bak.</p>
    <p>Dr Goh said preven­tion against car­dio­vas­cu­lar dis­ease should start as early as pos­si­ble, even though the risk of such dis­eases in women in­creases af­ter menopause.</p>
    <p>“Women should not wait till they are in their 40s be­fore mak­ing heart health their pri­or­ity. Early risk as­sess­ment and early de­tec­tion of risk fac­tors are im­por­tant, as well as early adop­tion of a healthy diet and ex­er­cise,” she said.</p>
    <p>She ad­vised those aged 18 years old and above to go for screen­ing of car­dio­vas­cu­lar dis­ease risk fac­tors such as di­a­betes and hy­per­ten­sion.</p>
    <p>De­pend­ing on the re­sults, a reg­u­lar car­dio­vas­cu­lar screen­ing or fur­ther eval­u­a­tion for heart dis­ease may be sug­gested by the doc­tor.</p>
    <p>Said Dr Khu­rana: “Women need to be ed­u­cated about their risk of car­dio­vas­cu­lar dis­ease and taught to recog­nise the symp­toms of coro­nary heart dis­ease and stroke early so that they can speak to a doc­tor im­me­di­ately when they ex­pe­ri­ence them. Early de­tec­tion and treat­ment im­prove long-term out­comes and qual­ity of life.”</p>
    <p>Women should not wait till they are in their 40s be­fore mak­ing heart health their pri­or­ity. Early risk as­sess­ment and early de­tec­tion of risk fac­tors are im­por­tant, as well as early adop­tion of a healthy diet ’’ and ex­er­cise.</p>
    <p>DR GOH PING PING, a car­di­ol­o­gist at Mount El­iz­a­beth Hos­pi­tal. She ad­vises those aged 18 years and above to go for screen­ing of car­dio­vas­cu­lar dis­ease risk fac­tors such as di­a­betes and hy­per­ten­sion</p>
    <p>1 Main­tain a healthy diet</p>
    <p>Try to avoid un­healthy food loaded with trans fats, salt and sugar as these in­crease risk fac­tors such as bad choles­terol and triglyc­erides, high blood pres­sure, di­a­betes and obe­sity.</p>
    <p>If un­sure about what healthy food to eat, try stick­ing to a Mediter­ranean diet of veg­eta­bles, fruits, fish and whole grains.</p>
    <p>2 Avoid smok­ing</p>
    <p>The chem­i­cals in cig­a­rette smoke can nar­row the blood ves­sels and cause car­dio­vas­cu­lar dis­ease, stroke, pe­riph­eral artery dis­ease and aneurysm.</p>
    <p>Ex­po­sure to sec­ond-hand smoke can also cause car­dio­vas­cu­lar dis­ease in non-smok­ers. If you do not smoke but are al­ways around some­one who does, en­cour­age him or her to quit.</p>
    <p>3 Be phys­i­cally ac­tive</p>
    <p>At least 150 minutes of mod­er­ate-in­ten­sity ex­er­cise a week can lower blood pres­sure and bad choles­terol to a healthy level.</p>
    <p>If you are cur­rently in­ac­tive, start slow as even a few minutes of ex­er­cise a day may of­fer some health ben­e­fits.</p>
    <p>4 Main­tain a healthy weight</p>
    <p>Obe­sity puts you at greater risk of high choles­terol, high blood pres­sure and in­sulin re­sis­tance – the fac­tors that in­crease the risk of car­dio­vas­cu­lar dis­ease.</p>
    <p>If you are un­sure whether your weight is in the nor­mal or healthy range, use a Body Mass In­dex (BMI) cal­cu­la­tor to mea­sure your body fat. In gen­eral, a BMI of 25 or higher is con­sid­ered over­weight.</p>
    <p>5 Re­duce stress lev­els</p>
    <p>Some peo­ple cope with stress in un­healthy ways – such as overeat­ing, drink­ing and smok­ing – giv­ing rise to car­dio­vas­cu­lar dis­ease.</p>
    <p>Stress in women can also re­sult in Takot­subo car­diomy­opa­thy, which changes the shape of the heart mus­cle, re­sult­ing in heart rhythm prob­lems, shock or even death.</p>
    <p>6 Get good qual­ity sleep</p>
    <p>Peo­ple who do not get enough sleep have a higher risk of obe­sity, high blood pres­sure, heart at­tack, di­a­betes and de­pres­sion.</p>
    <p>If you are clock­ing in the rec­om­mended seven to eight hours of sleep a night but are still tired through­out the day, ask your doc­tor if you need to be eval­u­ated for ob­struc­tive sleep ap­nea.</p>
    <p>Treat­ments for sleep ap­nea may in­clude los­ing weight if you are over­weight or us­ing a con­tin­u­ous air­way pres­sure de­vice that keeps your air­way open dur­ing sleep.</p>
    <p>7 Go for screen­ings</p>
    <p>High blood pres­sure, high lev­els of blood sugar and bad choles­terol in­crease your risk of car­dio­vas­cu­lar dis­ease.</p>
    <p>These can be mon­i­tored through reg­u­lar health screen­ings, which will en­able you to know whether you need to make the ap­pro­pri­ate life­style changes to re­duce your risk.</p>

    <p>• In con­junc­tion with World Heart Day on Sept 29 and Restart A Heart Day on Oct 16, the Sin­ga­pore Heart Foun­da­tion held a se­ries of vir­tual pro­grammes over the week­end to en­cour­age in­di­vid­u­als to take charge of their heart health. The events, which in­cluded talks by health ex­perts, work­outs and cook­ing demon­stra­tions, can be viewed at www.nhwwhd­vir­tual.sg un­til Oct 31.</p>
