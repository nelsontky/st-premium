    <p>Malaysia’s op­po­si­tion may not sup­port Prime Min­is­ter Muhyid­din Yassin’s bud­get if the gov­ern­ment does not make changes to it, op­po­si­tion politi­cians said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>“We are keen to pass the bud­get... so that we won’t bur­den the pub­lic, front­lin­ers or civil ser­vants. But if the bud­get is not amended, do not as­sume that it will be eas­ily passed,” op­po­si­tion leader and Parti Kead­i­lan Rakyat pres­i­dent An­war Ibrahim told Par­lia­ment.</p>
    <p>He said that six de­mands made by his Pakatan Harapan op­po­si­tion coali­tion, in­clud­ing the rein­tro­duc­tion of a blan­ket mora­to­rium on bank loans, were not met in the bud­get tabled last Fri­day.</p>
    <p>Fi­nance Min­is­ter Tengku Zafrul Aziz must study all the pro­pos­als to man­age Covid-19-re­lated prob­lems, said Datuk Seri An­war.</p>
    <p>Tan Sri Muhyid­din’s eight-month-old Perikatan Na­sional (PN) gov­ern­ment holds a slim ma­jor­ity in Par­lia­ment, with just 113 law­mak­ers out of a to­tal of 222 back­ing it at the last sit­ting. Fail­ure to pass its first fed­eral bud­get would be tan­ta­mount to a vote of no con­fi­dence and could trig­ger a snap elec­tion. The bud­get vote is slated for Nov 25.</p>
    <p>PN coali­tion part­ner Umno has pledged sup­port for the bud­get, de­spite in­ter­nal ten­sions with Mr Muhyid­din’s Parti Pribumi Ber­satu Malaysia.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, the King, Sul­tan Ab­dul­lah Ah­mad Shah, has re­peat­edly urged all MPs to pass the bud­get to safe­guard peo­ple’s wel­fare dur­ing the coro­n­avirus pan­demic.</p>
    <p>For­mer premier and op­po­si­tion MP Ma­hathir Mo­hamad, who leads Parti Pe­juang Tanah Air, has also called for amend­ments to the bud­get.</p>
    <p>“I hope this bud­get would be mod­i­fied in or­der to be­come more re­al­is­tic. Then we can sup­port it... We do not want to pre­cip­i­tate a cri­sis,” Tun Dr Ma­hathir said in a state­ment yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>De­scrib­ing the bud­get as “mind-bog­gling”, he ques­tioned how the gov­ern­ment would fund the RM322.5 bil­lion (S$105.4 bil­lion) it planned to spend on op­er­a­tions and de­vel­op­ment.</p>
    <p>“The ques­tion that I would like to ask is where the money will come from. The deficit is said to be about RM85 bil­lion,” he said, not­ing that key in­come earn­ers like the tourism sec­tor and state oil com­pany Petronas have been badly hit by the pan­demic. “I sup­pose the gov­ern­ment will have to bor­row to im­ple­ment the bud­get. This is es­ti­mated to in­crease gov­ern­ment debt to RM1.3 tril­lion. That is a lot of money. If you fail to ser­vice loans, you may be bankrupted,” he said.</p>
    <p>In­stead, he sug­gested cut­ting op­er­a­tional and de­vel­op­ment costs, such as salaries of high earn­ers in the gov­ern­ment, to pro­vide food to the un­em­ployed and those who have lost their in­come.</p>
    <p>The two-time prime min­is­ter also ques­tioned the gov­ern­ment’s eco­nomic growth es­ti­mates, which project gross do­mes­tic prod­uct (GDP) to grow 7.5 per cent next year af­ter shrink­ing an es­ti­mated 4 per cent this year.</p>
    <p>“It is ex­pected that vac­cines would put an end to the pan­demic. The in­dus­tries, trade and busi­ness will re­cover. But can they re­cover fully so as to achieve a GDP growth of 7.5 per cent?</p>
    <p>“Just think. From a shrink­age of 4 per cent to growth of 7.5 per cent, the re­cov­ery would be 11.5 per cent – fan­tas­tic,” said Dr Ma­hathir.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to his party Pe­juang, the bud­get does not take into ac­count pub­lic in­ter­est, go­ing against the spirit of the King’s ad­vice.</p>
    <p>“What the gov­ern­ment has done is to use the Agong’s (King’s) de­cree as a ‘blank cheque’ to in­clude some as­pects in the bud­get that lead to­wards po­lit­i­cal gain and set aside pub­lic in­ter­ests,” the party’s four law­mak­ers said in a state­ment yes­ter­day.</p>
