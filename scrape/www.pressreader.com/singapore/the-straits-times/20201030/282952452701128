    <p>The me­dia in­vi­ta­tion leads me to a non­de­script door tucked in a back al­ley be­hind Cir­cu­lar Road.</p>
    <p>I knock five times and am in­structed to en­ter “the realm of the sleep­ing man”: a dim room, its cor­ners stacked with bis­cuits and dry goods, its oc­cu­pant dor­mant on a couch. In front of a no­tice­board thick with leaflets about Covid-19 sup­port grants sits a lap­top. I take a seat and click to en­ter the ma­trix.</p>
    <p>The OH! Open House art walks usu­ally take vis­i­tors into the homes of oth­ers to view works of art, but this pan­demic edi­tion will be a vir­tual one.</p>
    <p>Its first sea­son, Walls Crum­ble, is a sur­real ad­ven­ture in Tele­text, a now-de­funct tele­vi­sion ser­vice that once kept Sin­ga­pore­ans posted on news, stock prices and the weather.</p>
    <p>It is a dig­i­tal wan­der through a dream­scape dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker pe­riod, filled with night­mar­ish scenes of tele­vised an­nounce­ments and empty su­per­mar­ket shelves.</p>
    <p>These are in­ter­spersed with video works like Ang Kia Yee’s I Am Home, in which the artist crouches in­side a card­board box with holes, through which she sticks out her limbs and awk­wardly at­tempts var­i­ous chores, from brush­ing her teeth to cook­ing in­stant noo­dles.</p>
    <p>In the vis­ceral per­for­mance work</p>
    <p>To­pog­ra­phy Of Breath 2.0, Pat Toh (above) con­sid­ers how the body nav­i­gates and en­dures a pan­demic. This work was first live-streamed on Wed­nes­day, with an edited it­er­a­tion ap­pear­ing later on­line.</p>
    <p>The OH! team wanted to present a “strange way of en­coun­ter­ing the world” that was not too close to the present, with its in­ter­minable Zoom meet­ings, says OH! co-founder and artis­tic di­rec­tor Alan Oei, 44.</p>
    <p>“It is a por­trait of some­thing on­go­ing. We wanted to sit­u­ate Covid-19 in re­la­tion to our lives, the idea that pan­demics have shaped ur­ban liv­ing in the past and now.”</p>
    <p>Days _ And Count­ing is a desk­top-only home ex­pe­ri­ence, though view­ing par­ties may be avail­able to OH! vol­un­teers and those on its mail­ing list.</p>
    <p>Two fu­ture edi­tions, The Dis­tance Be­tween Us and Wak­ing Up With A Crash, will be un­veiled at a later date. WHERE ohopen­house.on­line/ daysand­count­ing</p>
    <p>WHEN From to­day, 9pm</p>
    <p>AD­MIS­SION Free. Do­na­tions are rec­om­mended</p>
