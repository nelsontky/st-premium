    <p>KUALA LUMPUR • Malaysia has agreed to buy 12.8 mil­lion doses of Pfizer’s Covid-19 vac­cine, be­com­ing the first coun­try in South-east Asia to an­nounce a deal with the US drug­maker after some ex­pressed reser­va­tions over the need for ul­tra-cold stor­age.</p>
    <p>While fi­nal trial data showed that Pfizer’s vac­cine is 95 per cent ef­fec­tive, many Asian coun­tries are not bet­ting on it partly due to trop­i­cal heat, re­mote is­land com­mu­ni­ties and a lack of ul­tra-cold freez­ers.</p>
    <p>Pfizer’s vac­cine, jointly de­vel­oped with Ger­man part­ner BioNTech, must be stored and trans­ported at mi­nus 70 deg C, al­though it can be kept in a fridge for up to five days, or up to 15 days in a ther­mal ship­ping box.</p>
    <p>Prime Min­is­ter Muhyid­din Yassin yes­ter­day said Malaysia would give pri­or­ity to “high-risk groups... in­clud­ing front­lin­ers, se­nior cit­i­zens, and those with non­com­mu­ni­ca­ble dis­eases, such as heart dis­eases and di­a­betes”.</p>
    <p>Pfizer will de­liver the first one mil­lion doses in the first quar­ter of next year, with 1.7 mil­lion, 5.8 mil­lion and 4.3 mil­lion doses to fol­low in sub­se­quent quar­ters.</p>
    <p>The deal is ex­pected to cover 6.4 mil­lion Malaysians, or 20 per cent of the pop­u­la­tion, with an­other 10 per cent to be cov­ered un­der Malaysia’s par­tic­i­pa­tion in the global Co­vax fa­cil­ity, which is backed by the World Health Or­gan­i­sa­tion (WHO).</p>
    <p>Malaysia, which will dis­trib­ute the vac­cine to its peo­ple for free, re­ported 1,109 new Covid-19 in­fec­tions yes­ter­day, bring­ing the na­tional tally to 61,861. The death toll stands at 350.</p>
    <p>The coun­try plans to run a phase 3 trial of an ex­per­i­men­tal vac­cine de­vel­oped by the Chi­nese Academy of Med­i­cal Sciences. The trial will in­volve 3,000 par­tic­i­pants.</p>
    <p>Pfizer’s vac­cine still re­quires ap­provals from reg­u­la­tors in­clud­ing the US Food and Drug Ad­min­is­tra­tion (FDA) and Malaysia’s Health Min­istry be­fore it can be dis­trib­uted, Tan Sri Muhyid­din said dur­ing a tele­vised ad­dress.</p>
    <p>The FDA plans to meet on Dec 10 to dis­cuss whether to au­tho­rise the Pfizer vac­cine for emer­gency use.</p>
    <p>Pfizer and BioNTech have clinched sup­ply deals with sev­eral coun­tries, in­clud­ing the United States, Ger­many, Ja­pan, Canada, Aus­tralia and Bri­tain.</p>
    <p>They ex­pect to pro­duce glob­ally up to 50 mil­lion doses of vac­cines this year and up to 1.3 bil­lion doses next year.</p>
    <p>More than 150 po­ten­tial vac­cines are be­ing de­vel­oped and tested glob­ally to stop the Covid-19 pan­demic, with 48 in hu­man tri­als, the WHO says.</p>
    <p>This week, As­traZeneca said its vac­cine, de­vel­oped by Ox­ford Univer­sity, could be around 90 per cent ef­fec­tive, fol­low­ing pos­i­tive re­sults from Pfizer, Moderna and Rus­sia’s Sput­nik V.</p>
