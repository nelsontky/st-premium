    <p>A to­tal of 252 peo­ple have been ar­rested for var­i­ous of­fences dur­ing a 16-day en­force­ment op­er­a­tion led by Be­dok Po­lice Divi­sion.</p>
    <p>Most of the sus­pects were nabbed for of­fences re­lated to cheat­ing and loan-shark­ing ac­tiv­i­ties, while a small num­ber were hauled up for drug of­fences and other crimes.</p>
    <p>The sus­pects, aged be­tween 16 and 76, com­prise 186 men and 66 women.</p>
    <p>The op­er­a­tion took place from Nov 23 to Dec 8, the po­lice said in a state­ment yesterday.</p>
    <p>Of the 252 peo­ple, 50 men and 19 women are be­ing in­ves­ti­gated for their sus­pected in­volve­ment in e-commerce scams and money-laun­der­ing ac­tiv­i­ties, with the value of the trans­ac­tions ex­ceed­ing $1.5 mil­lion.</p>
    <p>An­other 129 men and 45 women, aged be­tween 18 and 76, are be­ing in­ves­ti­gated for loan scams and loan-shark ac­tiv­i­ties in­volv­ing trans­ac­tions of over $216,000.</p>
    <p>Among th­ese, 11 men and eight women, aged be­tween 20 and 61, were ar­rested for of­fences un­der the Moneylen­ders Act.</p>
    <p>The of­fence of cheat­ing car­ries a jail term of up to 10 years and a fine, while money-laun­der­ing is pun­ish­able with a jail term of up to 10 years and a fine of up to $500,000.</p>
    <p>First-time of­fend­ers found guilty of as­sist­ing in un­li­censed mon­eylend­ing can be fined be­tween $30,000 and $300,000, and jailed for up to four years with manda­tory can­ing of up to six strokes.</p>
    <p>Re­peat of­fend­ers are li­able for the same fine but face an in­creased jail term of up to seven years and manda­tory can­ing of up to 12 strokes.</p>
    <p>An­other four men and two women, aged be­tween 16 and 59, were ar­rested for drug-re­lated of­fences with sup­port from Cen­tral Nar­cotics Bureau of­fi­cers.</p>
    <p>Also nabbed were three other men, aged be­tween 24 and 42, for of­fences in­clud­ing crim­i­nal in­tim­i­da­tion and theft.</p>
    <p>The po­lice said all in­ves­ti­ga­tions are on­go­ing.</p>
    <p>The po­lice em­pha­sised the com­mit­ment of their of­fi­cers to con­tin­u­ing to work hard dur­ing the year-end fes­tive pe­riod.</p>
    <p>“This op­er­a­tion re­flects a com­mit­ment by Be­dok Po­lice Divi­sion to hold those who break our laws ac­count­able, and to pro­tect our res­i­dents from harm,” said As­sis­tant Com­mis­sioner of Po­lice Julius Lim, com­man­der of Be­dok Divi­sion.</p>
    <p>“I would like to pay trib­ute to the in­tel­li­gence com­mu­nity, the Cen­tral Nar­cotics Bureau, and dozens of in­ves­ti­ga­tors who worked tire­lessly, un­der dif­fi­cult con­di­tions, to bring the of­fend­ers to jus­tice,” he said. “Th­ese of­fi­cers care deeply about the safety and se­cu­rity of their neigh­bour­hoods, and will con­tinue to do their best to keep you safe dur­ing this year-end pe­riod.”</p>
    <p>The po­lice added that they will con­tinue to take tough en­force­ment ac­tion against those in­volved i n scams and un­li­censed mon­eylend­ing ac­tiv­i­ties. This in­cludes ac­tion against those who pro­vide their bank ac­counts to help un­li­censed moneylen­ders.</p>
    <p>For more i nfor­ma­tion on scams, mem­bers of the pub­lic can visit sca­malert.sg or call the Anti-Scam Hot­line on 1800-722-6688.</p>
    <p>If you sus­pect any­one of be­ing in­volved in un­li­censed mon­eylend­ing ac­tiv­i­ties or know of any­one who might be, call the po­lice on 999 or the X-Ah Long hot­line on 1800-924-5664.</p>
