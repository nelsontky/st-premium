    <p>The vast ma­jor­ity of those who sought re­lief from their con­trac­tual obli­ga­tions, un­der laws passed ear­lier this year, did so re­gard­ing prop­erty leas­ing and li­cens­ing agree­ments.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to fig­ures re­leased by the Min­istry of Law (MinLaw), as at Aug 5, 6,587 no­tices had been sub­mit­ted on­line via FormSG by in­di­vid­u­als and busi­nesses seek­ing a six-month le­gal re­prieve from their con­trac­tual obli­ga­tions.</p>
    <p>Nearly 80 per cent of those were re­lated to leases and li­cences of com­mer­cial and in­dus­trial prop­erty.</p>
    <p>But only about one in six no­tices served ended up in dis­pute.</p>
    <p>Event- and tourism-re­lated con­tracts and non-res­i­den­tial prop­erty leases and li­cences made up the bulk of the dis­putes.</p>
    <p>In April, Par­lia­ment passed laws un­der the Covid-19 (Tem­po­rary Mea­sures) Act to al­low in­di­vid­u­als and busi­nesses to seek re­prieve from their con­trac­tual obli­ga­tions for six months.</p>
    <p>These in­cluded rental pay­ments for com­mer­cial and in­dus­trial prop­er­ties, con­struc­tion and sup­ply con­tracts, as well as cer­tain se­cured loan fa­cil­i­ties granted by a bank or fi­nance com­pany to small and medium-sized com­pa­nies.</p>
    <p>Con­tracts for events such as wed­dings or con­fer­ences, as well as cruise and ho­tel book­ings, are also cov­ered un­der the Act. Cer­tain hire-pur­chase agree­ments, such as ve­hi­cle loans taken out by pri­vate­hire driv­ers, are also cov­ered.</p>
    <p>Only con­trac­tual obli­ga­tions that are to be per­formed on or after Feb 1 and con­tracts that were en­tered into be­fore March 25 are cov­ered un­der the Act. The six-month re­lief pe­riod starts from April 20 and ends on Oct 19. The Act al­lows the Min­is­ter for Law to ex­tend the re­lief pe­riod by an­other six months, if deemed nec­es­sary.</p>
    <p>If par­ties raise a dis­pute over the no­ti­fi­ca­tion for re­lief, they can seek help from MinLaw, which will then ap­point an as­ses­sor to de­cide if the party’s in­abil­ity to per­form con­trac­tual obli­ga­tions was due to Covid-19.</p>
    <p>Most no­ti­fi­ca­tions for re­lief have been for con­tracts cov­er­ing leases and li­cences of non-res­i­den­tial prop­erty, with 2,518 no­ti­fi­ca­tions for re­lief sub­mit­ted.</p>
    <p>The sec­ond most com­mon area was for con­tracts cov­er­ing hire-pur­chase and con­di­tional sales agree­ments for com­mer­cial ve­hi­cles, or plant or ma­chin­ery for com­mer­cial pur­poses, with 2,500 no­ti­fi­ca­tions for re­lief sub­mit­ted.</p>
    <p>This was fol­lowed by con­tracts cov­er­ing the con­struc­tion or sup­ply sec­tor with 520 no­ti­fi­ca­tions for re­lief, and event- and tourism-re­lated con­tracts at 517 no­ti­fi­ca­tions.</p>
    <p>Con­tracts cov­er­ing the leases or rental agree­ments for com­mer­cial equip­ment or com­mer­cial ve­hi­cles saw 279 no­ti­fi­ca­tions for re­lief, while those con­tracts cov­er­ing op­tions to pur­chase and sale and pur­chase agree­ments with hous­ing de­vel­op­ers saw 38 no­ti­fi­ca­tions.</p>
    <p>These last two con­tract types were added to the list of sched­uled con­tracts cov­ered un­der the Act on June 20 and May 13 re­spec­tively.</p>
    <p>MinLaw said it has re­ceived 1,094 ap­pli­ca­tions for an as­ses­sor’s de­ter­mi­na­tion as at Aug 5.</p>
    <p>Nearly three in five of these ap­pli­ca­tions have con­cluded, with 225 de­ter­mi­na­tions is­sued cov­er­ing most cat­e­gories of con­tracts cov­ered un­der the Act and 422 ap­pli­ca­tions ei­ther be­ing with­drawn by par­ties after re­solv­ing the mat­ter or re­jected by the Reg­istry of the Panel of As­ses­sors.</p>
    <p>Of the re­main­ing 447 ap­pli­ca­tions pend­ing, nearly half in­volve the leases and li­cences of non-res­i­den­tial prop­erty, with 200 cases, while event- and tourism-re­lated con­tracts make up 149 cases.</p>
    <p>A spokesman for MinLaw said hear­ings for the as­ses­sor’s de­ter­mi­na­tion are held once the Regis­trar is sat­is­fied that the ap­pli­cant has sub­mit­ted the nec­es­sary doc­u­ments, and the re­spon­dent has sub­mit­ted a re­sponse to the Regis­trar and served the re­sponse to the ap­pli­cant and rel­e­vant par­ties.</p>
    <p>The spokesman said par­ties need to ap­ply for a de­ter­mi­na­tion only if they have a dis­pute that they are un­able to work out them­selves.</p>
    <p>“We en­cour­age par­ties to be fair and con­sid­er­ate to each other, given how Covid-19 was un­ex­pected and how it would be more ben­e­fi­cial for the par­ties’ re­la­tion­ship to reach a mu­tu­ally agree­able so­lu­tion,” said the spokesman.</p>
