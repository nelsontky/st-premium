    <p>WASH­ING­TON • The United States has black­listed a Chi­nese com­pany that makes el­e­ments for steel pro­duc­tion, 12 Ira­nian steel and met­als mak­ers and three for­eign­based sales agents of an Ira­nian met­als and min­ing hold­ing com­pany, seek­ing to de­prive Iran of rev­enues as Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump’s term winds down.</p>
    <p>The US Trea­sury, in a state­ment on Tues­day, named the Chin­abased com­pany as Kaifeng Ping­mei New Car­bon Ma­te­ri­als Tech­nol­ogy (KFCC), say­ing that it spe­cialised in the man­u­fac­ture of car­bon ma­te­ri­als and had pro­vided thou­sands of tonnes of ma­te­ri­als to Ira­nian steel com­pa­nies be­tween De­cem­ber 2019 and June last year.</p>
    <p>No one at Kaifeng Ping­mei, which makes graphite elec­trodes, was available for com­ment yes­ter­day. Fil­ings show the com­pany is owned by He­nan Yicheng New En­ergy, which said it was un­aware of the sit­u­a­tion.</p>
    <p>Shares in Yicheng, which is ul­ti­mately con­trolled by China’s He­nan prov­ince, fell as much as 6.7 per cent to a two-week low yes­ter­day. When He­nan Yicheng was buy­ing KFCC in 2019, it said ex­ports – to South-east Asia, the Mid­dle East and Eu­rope – ac­counted for about half of the com­pany’s core busi­ness.</p>
    <p>Among the 12 Ira­nian com­pa­nies black­listed are the Pasar­gad Steel Com­plex and the Gi­lan Steel Com­plex, both of which were des­ig­nated for op­er­at­ing in the Ira­nian steel sec­tor.</p>
    <p>The oth­ers in­clude Iran-based Mid­dle East Mines and Min­eral In­dus­tries Devel­op­ment, Khazar Steel, Vian Steel Com­plex, South Rouhina Steel Com­plex, Yazd In­dus­trial Con­struc­tional Steel Rolling Mill, West Al­borz Steel Com­plex, Es­farayen In­dus­trial Com­plex and Bonab Steel In­dus­try Com­plex.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump’s term ends on Jan 20, when Demo­crat Pres­i­dent-elect Joe Bi­den is to be sworn in.</p>
