    <p>Amend­ments to the re­cent Work­ers’ Party (WP) mo­tion on the crim­i­nal jus­tice sys­tem were made to more ac­cu­rately re­flect the de­bate in Par­lia­ment, es­tab­lish com­mon ground with the op­po­si­tion, and ob­tain bi­par­ti­san sup­port, said Leader of the House In­dra­nee Ra­jah yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Writ­ing on Face­book, she said the amend­ments to the mo­tion, moved on Wed­nes­day by WP chair­man Sylvia Lim (Alju­nied GRC), were up for fur­ther de­bate and that Speaker Tan Chuan-Jin had in­vited all MPs to speak on the mat­ter.</p>
    <p>“None of the op­po­si­tion MPs did so,” said Ms In­dra­nee. “Ms Lim stated that she only wanted to speak to close the de­bate.”</p>
    <p>The mo­tion, which came in the wake of the ac­quit­tal of for­mer do­mes­tic helper Parti Liyani and a lengthy min­is­te­rial state­ment on the case by Law and Home Af­fairs Min­is­ter K. Shan­mugam, orig­i­nally stated: “That this House af­firms that fair­ness, ac­cess and in­de­pen­dence are cor­ner­stones of Sin­ga­pore’s jus­tice sys­tem, and calls on the Gov­ern­ment to recog­nise and rem­edy its short­com­ings in or­der to en­hance jus­tice for all, re­gard­less of means or so­cial sta­tus, in­clud­ing fa­cil­i­tat­ing a re­view of the jus­tice sys­tem.”</p>
    <p>Mr Murali Pil­lai (Bukit Ba­tok), chair­man of the Gov­ern­ment Par­lia­men­tary Com­mit­tee for Home Af­fairs and Law, then sug­gested amend­ments which were passed by Par­lia­ment but dis­sented by WP MPs.</p>
    <p>The mo­tion now reads: “That this House recog­nises that fair­ness, ac­cess and in­de­pen­dence are cor­ner­stones of Sin­ga­pore’s jus­tice sys­tem, and af­firms the Gov­ern­ment’s con­tin­u­ous ef­forts since in­de­pen­dence to build a fair and just so­ci­ety and rem­edy any short­com­ing in or­der to en­hance jus­tice for all, re­gard­less of race, lan­guage, re­li­gion, eco­nomic means, or so­cial sta­tus.”</p>
    <p>The next day, the WP’s Mr Leon Per­era (Alju­nied GRC) posted a pic­ture on Face­book dis­play­ing the orig­i­nal mo­tion with its amend­ments, along with a caption stat­ing: “The Work­ers’ Party’s orig­i­nal mo­tion called for an ex­ter­nal re­view to con­sider changes to ad­dress gaps and short­com­ings in the cur­rent jus­tice sys­tem, par­tic­u­larly as re­lates to ac­cess to jus­tice for all. Have a look at how the amend­ment changed the mean­ing and sense of that mo­tion.”</p>
    <p>Fel­low WP mem­ber Ken­neth Foo, a can­di­date at this year’s elec­tion, then com­mented on the post that “when you con­trol the Par­lia­ment, you call the shots”.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, Ms In­dra­nee sought to clar­ify the se­quence of events in Par­lia­ment, and opened her Face­book post by ask­ing di­rectly: “Did the PAP (Peo­ple’s Ac­tion Party) re­ally can­cel out the WP mo­tion?”</p>
    <p>The Min­is­ter in the Prime Min­is­ter’s Of­fice wrote that the orig­i­nal call to the Gov­ern­ment to recog­nise and rem­edy its short­com­ings was un­clear in what “its” re­ferred to. “It could mean the sys­tem as a whole is de­fec­tive. Or it could mean gov­ern­ment short­com­ings which have some­how made the sys­tem de­fec­tive,” she said.</p>
    <p>And the orig­i­nal call for a re­view of the jus­tice sys­tem sug­gested the en­tire sys­tem was de­fec­tive, Ms In­dra­nee noted.</p>
    <p>“How­ever as the de­bate pro­gressed, it be­came clear that there was bi­par­ti­san con­sen­sus that our sys­tem is not bro­ken, has served Sin­ga­pore well, and is im­prov­ing. But as with any sys­tem, it can be fur­ther im­proved,” she said, point­ing out that Ms Lim had said the same in her speech.</p>
    <p>“In­deed there was a lot of com­mon ground be­tween the PAP and WP MPs in the de­bate,” Ms In­dra­nee added.</p>
    <p>She noted that many of the WP’s sug­ges­tions put forth dur­ing the de­bate were al­ready be­ing con­sid­ered by the Gov­ern­ment – such as the no­tion of a pub­lic de­fend­ers’ of­fice.</p>
    <p>“Other sug­ges­tions could not be so eas­ily im­ple­mented due to high costs and po­ten­tial down­sides. For sug­ges­tions that the Gov­ern­ment dis­agreed with, the PAP min­is­ters took pains to ex­plain why this was so,” said Ms In­dra­nee, a for­mer prac­tis­ing lawyer.</p>
    <p>“After all the speeches were de­liv­ered... it was ev­i­dent that a wide rang­ing root and branch re­view of the jus­tice sys­tem was not nec­es­sary.”</p>
    <p>Amend­ments, she added, were a more con­struc­tive course of ac­tion com­pared with re­ject­ing the WP’s mo­tion al­to­gether.</p>
    <p>Ms In­dra­nee also noted that the WP MPs had agreed to some amend­ments but not oth­ers. She said their op­po­si­tion to the third amend­ment – from “its” to “any” short­com­ings – was, in par­tic­u­lar, “puz­zling and sad”.</p>
    <p>“Mr Murali was cer­tainly not say­ing that there were no short­com­ings,” said Ms In­dra­nee.</p>
    <p>“On the con­trary, by in­clud­ing the words ‘any short­com­ings’ the amend­ment ex­pressly recog­nises that there are in­deed short­com­ings and these must be reme­died, as we have reme­died other short­com­ings over the years.</p>
    <p>“But the amended mo­tion also seeks to be fair, and ac­knowl­edges that the Gov­ern­ment has over the years con­tin­u­ously tried to im­prove the sys­tem. But the op­po­si­tion MPs would not ac­knowl­edge this.”</p>
    <p>She con­cluded: “The Gov­ern­ment will nev­er­the­less con­tinue in our ef­forts to im­prove our sys­tem and en­hance jus­tice for all.”</p>
