    <p>•</p>
    <p>The trade deal that both sides of the English Chan­nel say re­flects a new era of co­op­er­a­tion is es­sen­tially a sideshow for the City of Lon­don, which is still await­ing its own seal of ap­proval from the Euro­pean Union.</p>
    <p>EU of­fi­cials must rule sep­a­rately that Bri­tish fi­nan­cial regulation­s and over­sight are strong enough to cre­ate a level play­ing field.</p>
    <p>With­out that, a steady leak­age of busi­ness – al­ready un­der way in some ar­eas – may be­come a daily re­al­ity for Bri­tain’s fi­nance in­dus­try.</p>
    <p>Prime Min­is­ter Boris Johnson has al­ready said in an in­ter­view with The Sun­day Tele­graph that, when it comes to fi­nan­cial ser­vices, the treaty “per­haps does not go as far as we would like”.</p>
    <p>Chan­cel­lor of the Ex­che­quer Rishi Su­nak said that dis­cus­sions with Brus­sels over ac­cess for fi­nan­cial ser­vices will con­tinue.</p>
    <p>While there has been progress in pre­vent­ing Brexit from up­end­ing fi­nan­cial mar­kets i n the short term, there is lit­tle con­sen­sus on the ul­ti­mate na­ture of the Bri­tish fi­nance in­dus­try’s re­la­tion­ship with the EU, just days be­fore it loses much of its long­stand­ing ac­cess to the bloc.</p>
    <p>“The dan­ger­ous bit is that you are see­ing peo­ple mov­ing as­sets, mov­ing trad­ing books to other lo­ca­tions,” Mr Howard Davies, chair­man of NatWest Group, said in a Bloomberg Tele­vi­sion in­ter­view last month.</p>
    <p>“The risk is that as that hap­pens, then the staff fol­low over time.”</p>
    <p>The hope a mong Bri­tish bankers, reg­u­la­tors and politi­cians is that the trade deal helps un­lock a sep­a­rate agree­ment for fi­nance.</p>
    <p>The in­dus­try is a key pil­lar of the Bri­tish econ­omy, em­ploy­ing more than one mil­lion peo­ple and ac­count­ing for more than a tenth of all tax rev­enue.</p>
    <p>‘CLEAR-EYED’</p>
    <p>“While a deal is wel­come, fi­nan­cial and re­lated pro­fes­sional ser­vices are clear-eyed about the need for both sides to con­tinue to develop the re­la­tion­ship in ser­vices,” said Mr Miles Celic, chief ex­ec­u­tive of TheCi­tyUK, rep­re­sent­ing Bri­tain’s fi­nance hub.</p>
    <p>Like­wise, bankers in Europe are ea­ger for clar­ity.</p>
    <p>The As­so­ci­a­tion for Fi­nan­cial Mar­kets in Europe, one of the re­gion’s big­gest in­dus­try lobby groups, called for an agree­ment on “equiv­a­lence” de­ci­sions, which would smooth cross-border fi­nan­cial mar­ket ac­cess.</p>
    <p>“We hope that this lays the foun­da­tion for fur­ther co­op­er­a­tion on fi­nan­cial ser­vices,” said its CEO Adam Farkas.</p>
    <p>“It is im­por­tant that the EU and the United King­dom now ur­gently put in place out­stand­ing equiv­a­lence de­ci­sions to mit­i­gate disruption at the end of the tran­si­tion pe­riod and en­sure a smooth adap­ta­tion to the new re­la­tion­ship.”</p>
    <p>Still, even the most op­ti­mistic fi­nanciers con­cede that the sta­tus quo, with Lon­don as the fi­nan­cial hub for an en­tire con­ti­nent, is un­likely to hold.</p>
    <p>Euro­pean Com­mis­sion pres­i­dent Ur­sula von der Leyen has vowed “all will change” in the City of Lon­don’s re­la­tion­ship with the EU.</p>
    <p>And, in a sign of what is to come,</p>
    <p>Bank of France gov­er­nor Fran­cois Villeroy de Gal­hau warned Europe’s banks last Oc­to­ber to pre­pare for a longer-term shift away from us­ing Lon­don clear­ing houses, which un­der­pin the mul­ti­tril­lion-dol­lar de­riv­a­tives mar­kets.</p>
    <p>FUN­DA­MEN­TAL QUES­TION</p>
    <p>It goes “back to this core and fun­da­men­tal ques­tion of where Europe wants to have its cen­tre of fi­nan­cial ac­tiv­ity”, Ms Mairead McGuin­ness, Euro­pean com­mis­sioner for fi­nan­cial ser­vices, told Euronews last month.</p>
    <p>“It cer­tainly will not, in the long term, con­tinue to be the City of Lon­don.”</p>
    <p>With Bri­tain suf­fer­ing its worst re­ces­sion in more than three cen­turies, it can ill af­ford dam­age to the fi­nance sec­tor that paid about £75 bil­lion (S$135 bil­lion) in tax in 2018.</p>
    <p>De­spite that, fi­nan­cial ser­vices gar­nered lit­tle of the at­ten­tion be­stowed on fish­ing in the trade talks, even though every fish­er­man in Bri­tain could fit in the City of Lon­don’s lat­est of­fice tower.</p>
    <p>“Noth­ing against fish­er­men, and I eat a lot of fish, but none­the­less, the fi­nan­cial sec­tor is a larger share of the econ­omy than the fish­ing sec­tor and yet we hear noth­ing,” Mr Davies said in an in­ter­view last Oc­to­ber.</p>
    <p>Com­pa­nies, in­clud­ing JPMor­gan Chase & Co and Gold­man Sachs Group, have re­cently started to shift more busi­ness to the bloc.</p>
    <p>The moves, which for JPMor­gan in­cluded €200 bil­lion (S$325 bil­lion) in as­sets and 200 staff, are just the “first wave”, Ms Dorothee Bless­ing, the head of the firm’s Frank­furt unit, said last Septem­ber.</p>
    <p>Non-Ger­man lenders are in the</p>
    <p>NO ECO­NOMIC AD­VAN­TAGE HERE</p>
    <p>Brexit is an un­nec­es­sary dis­trac­tion. No­body has shown me a sin­gle ad­van­tage eco­nom­i­cally in any shape or form.</p>
    <p>MR MICHAEL MAINELLI, ex­ec­u­tive chair­man of Z/Yen.</p>
    <p>process of mov­ing €397 bil­lion of hold­ings to Ger­many, tak­ing their com­bined bal­ance sheet there to €675 bil­lion at the end of the year, the Bun­des­bank said in a pre­sen­ta­tion to re­porters at the start of Novem­ber last year.</p>
    <p>The Euro­pean Cen­tral Bank has said banks have agreed to ul­ti­mately move a to­tal of €1.3 tril­lion of as­sets to the euro area.</p>
    <p>Else­where, more than half of stock trad­ing in Lon­don is in shares of Euro­pean com­pa­nies and may mi­grate to EU venues.</p>
    <p>Last Novem­ber, the 300-yearold Lon­don Stock Ex­change Group joined other trad­ing venues in open­ing a plat­form in the EU be­cause of the ab­sence of a deal for fi­nance.</p>
    <p>For now, Lon­don has hardly been hol­lowed out and it holds for­mi­da­ble ad­van­tages that will take years, if not decades, to erode.</p>
    <p>Plenty see an op­por­tu­nity for the City of Lon­don, whose global stature is tes­ta­ment to its long his­tory of adap­ta­tion.</p>
    <p>“Lon­don will rein­vent it­self to re­main a hub,” said Mr Ali Ja­mal, founder of wealth man­ager Azura, which has an of­fice in May­fair and man­ages about US$3 bil­lion (S$4 bil­lion). “No city in Europe can com­pete with Lon­don on three fac­tors: lan­guage, le­gal sys­tem and in­fra­struc­ture.”</p>
    <p>GET GO­ING</p>
    <p>Still, it has been hard pre­par­ing for a fu­ture that is both murky and very com­plex.</p>
    <p>The gov­ern­ment ar­ranged a we­bi­nar last Oc­to­ber for fi­nance firms, with a pre-recorded speech and slides on top­ics such as ac­count­ing, em­bla­zoned with the brand­ing – “UK’s new start, let’s</p>
    <p>get go­ing”, ac­cord­ing to one at­tendee who asked not to be named.</p>
    <p>The con­tent was too gen­eral to be use­ful, the per­son said.</p>
    <p>The trade deal of­fers some cer­tainty to the broader econ­omy, which will in­di­rectly help the banks.</p>
    <p>“Reach­ing a trade deal is im­por­tant for our cor­po­rate clients as they will want to avoid the im­pacts of tar­iffs on cross-border trade in goods,” said Mr James Bardrick, head of the UK at Cit­i­group.</p>
    <p>And the deal may also help un­lock what Mr Bardrick and his peers want most: an EU dec­la­ra­tion that UK regulation­s are ro­bust, known as equiv­a­lence.</p>
    <p>This rul­ing would en­able busi­ness to con­tinue largely as usual, but it is in the hands of the EU, which can also with­draw equiv­a­lence at short no­tice.</p>
    <p>Over the long haul, much will de­pend on the course of po­lit­i­cal horse-trad­ing for fi­nance and what reg­u­la­tors and su­per­vi­sors ex­pect, ac­cord­ing to Mr Bardrick.</p>
    <p>“We and the rest of the in­dus­try may need to evolve our plans and staffing lev­els to serve our clients in Europe ef­fec­tively,” he said.</p>
    <p>It is that lin­ger­ing un­cer­tainty that is set to de­fine the City of Lon­don’s fu­ture even as Bri­tain be­gins to ne­go­ti­ate trade ac­cords i n earnest.</p>
    <p>“Four years ago, a na­tion de­cided to shoot it­self in the foot and see if it could run a race,” said Mr Michael Mainelli, ex­ec­u­tive chair­man of fi­nance con­sul­tancy Z/Yen, who was elected sher­iff of the City of Lon­don in 2019.</p>
    <p>“Brexit is an un­nec­es­sary dis­trac­tion. No­body has shown me a sin­gle ad­van­tage eco­nom­i­cally in any shape or form.”</p>
