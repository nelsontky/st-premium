    <p>•</p>
    <p>US job growth slowed more than ex­pected last month as the re­cov­ery from the Covid-19 slump shifts into lower gear amid di­min­ish­ing gov­ern­ment money and a re­lent­less pan­demic, leav­ing many at the risk of be­ing per­ma­nently un­em­ployed.</p>
    <p>In the last monthly em­ploy­ment re­port be­fore the Nov 3 pres­i­den­tial elec­tion, the US Labour De­part­ment said yes­ter­day that non-farm pay­rolls in­creased by 661,000 jobs last month af­ter ris­ing 1.49 mil­lion in Au­gust. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast that 850,000 jobs would be cre­ated last month.</p>
    <p>Em­ploy­ment growth peaked in June, when pay­rolls jumped by a record 4.78 mil­lion jobs.</p>
    <p>The un­em­ploy­ment rate fell to 7.9 per cent last month from 8.4 per cent in Au­gust. While the job­less rate has de­clined from a high of 14.7 per cent in April, it has been bi­ased down by peo­ple mis­clas­si­fy­ing them­selves as be­ing “em­ployed but ab­sent from work”.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day’s num­bers are sure to be­come a po­lit­i­cal foot­ball in the race for the White House, for which the eco­nomic blow from the pan­demic has been a top is­sue.</p>
    <p>For his part, Repub­li­can Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump is likely to tout the fifth straight month of job gains and lower un­em­ploy­ment as a sign of progress for an econ­omy that plunged into re­ces­sion in Fe­bru­ary.</p>
    <p>But last month’s em­ploy­ment gains were the small­est since the jobs re­cov­ery started in May and left the labour mar­ket a long way from re­coup­ing the 22.2 mil­lion jobs lost in March and April, in­di­cat­ing slower growth head­ing into the fourth quar­ter.</p>
    <p>For­mer vice-pres­i­dent Joe Bi­den, the Demo­cratic Party nom­i­nee, blames the eco­nomic tur­moil on the White House’s han­dling of the pan­demic, which has killed more than 210,000 peo­ple and in­fected over seven mil­lion in the na­tion.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump said yes­ter­day that he and his wife Me­la­nia had tested pos­i­tive for Covid-19.</p>
    <p>New coro­n­avirus cases are ris­ing, with a surge ex­pected in the au­tumn, which could lead to some re­stric­tions be­ing im­posed on busi­nesses in the ser­vice sec­tor.</p>
    <p>Po­lit­i­cal un­cer­tainty is in­creas­ing and could ex­tend be­yond the elec­tion, and make busi­nesses cau­tious about hir­ing.</p>
    <p>Walt Dis­ney said this week that it would lay off roughly 28,000 em­ploy­ees in its theme parks di­vi­sion.</p>
    <p>Amer­i­can Air­lines and United Air­lines, two of the largest US car­ri­ers, said they were be­gin­ning fur­loughs of more than 32,000 work­ers on Thurs­day, with­out gov­ern­ment as­sis­tance.</p>
