    <p>UNITED STATES Typ­i­cally, David Lee Roth spends his days, or at least his nights, “in tac­ti­cal span­dex, mov­ing at 134 beats per minute”, he said.</p>
    <p>But the 65-year-old Van Halen singer is now just like the rest of us: stuck at home and ob­sess­ing about pan­demics.</p>
    <p>How­ever, the past few months in quar­an­tine have led Roth to an old pur­suit with new fo­cus.</p>
    <p>Since April, he has filled his days cre­at­ing Covid-19-themed draw­ings – he calls them comics – and then post­ing the fin­ished works, one each week, on his social me­dia chan­nels.</p>
    <p>The art, like Roth’s mu­sic and dis­po­si­tion, is vi­brant, whim­si­cal and some­what un­con­ven­tional. In mo­ments, it is con­fronta­tional. Sev­eral draw­ings fea­ture his own face. Many are filled with im­ages of frogs.</p>
    <p>What sparked this surge of artis­tic ex­pres­sion? “Well, I lost my job,” he cracked over the tele­phone from his home in Los An­ge­les on an af­ter­noon late last month.</p>
    <p>As re­cently as March, he was on tour as a solo act, sup­port­ing rock band Kiss i n are­nas across the United States.</p>
    <p>Ear­lier in that run, Roth, who has also worked as an emergency med­i­cal tech­ni­cian in New York, had bat­tled an un­spec­i­fied ill­ness.</p>
    <p>“I’m not so un­con­vinced I didn’t have the corona,” he said.</p>
    <p>Even by rock-front­man stan­dards, his abil­ity to com­mand full at­ten­tion from his au­di­ence is renowned, whether he is launch­ing him­self off drum ris­ers for mid-air splits or school­ing fans on how Van Halen is “the rock ’n’ roll band who sold Ricky Ri­cardo rumba to the heavy metal na­tion”.</p>
    <p>But now his art is do­ing the talk­ing. “Social com­men­tary is what I do,” he said. “It’s what I’ve al­ways done.”</p>
    <p>These are edited ex­cerpts from the conversati­on.</p>
    <p>Can you de­scribe your artis­tic process?</p>
    <p>My ap­proach is the best of both worlds: vin­tage and hy­per-atomic dig­i­tal. Sort of like watch­ing (1960s cop se­ries) Drag­net on your iPad.</p>
    <p>You know, I moved to Ja­pan for two-plus years to study sumi-e (Ja­panese ink paint­ing) and cal­lig­ra­phy. Four nights a week, I trained and then did home­work.</p>
    <p>I have spent thou­sands of hours learn­ing to use a horse­hair brush with a block of ink I grind my­self – it has not changed its recipe in 700 years.</p>
    <p>What ap­peals to you about us­ing brush and ink as a means of artis­tic ex­pres­sion?</p>
    <p>Hold on. This is not ex­press­ing my­self. This is per­for­mance ther­apy. I am vent­ing. I am an­gry. And I am not ask­ing for for­give­ness. And this is how I do it.</p>
    <p>People do not usu­ally think of David Lee Roth as an­gry.</p>
    <p>That is be­cause I have tran­scended it. It is that se­cret magic when you take something that is es­sen­tially sad and find hu­mour, elo­quence and some­times illuminati­on in it.</p>
    <p>You were on tour when the lock­down be­gan. As a life­long per­former, was it dif­fi­cult be­ing forced to leave the road so hastily? Ev­ery jiu-jitsu magazine has a 28-year-old who is go­ing to tell you about the two years that got taken away by his el­bow. Ev­ery kick­box­ing magazine has a 32-year-old in­struc­tor who goes: “Well, I lost those three years to my left knee.”</p>
    <p>So I have just been iso­lat­ing away. Be­cause I my­self am high-risk.</p>
    <p>For how long will we con­tinue to see new art­work from David Lee Roth?</p>
    <p>Like the tat­too artist said, till I do not have any friends left. Un­til my In­sta­gram is empty.</p>
    <p>I can do this end­lessly. I had not con­sid­ered this as something other than af­ter din­ner at the camp­fire. But lo and be­hold, people have taken a real fas­ci­na­tion.</p>
    <p>Given that fas­ci­na­tion, will these draw­ings even­tu­ally be of­fered for sale?</p>
    <p>In terms of what I re­ally do for a liv­ing, as soon as the B-list – that is, Bey­once, Bono and Bruce (Spring­steen) – say it is okay, I will be back singing and danc­ing and sell­ing you T-shirts.</p>
    <p>But in the in­terim, I am draw­ing and paint­ing ev­ery night. And the fact that there is an au­di­ence for it is quite a tickle.</p>
    <p>So of course I will make it avail­able. You bet. I just did not see it com­ing.</p>
