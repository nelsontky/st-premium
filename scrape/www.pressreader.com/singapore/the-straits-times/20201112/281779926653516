    <p>The re­turn to power of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in In­dia’s eastern state of Bihar is a big boost for Prime Min­is­ter Naren­dra Modi, with the re­sult be­ing seen as a sig­nal by vot­ers that he is the best op­tion for tack­ling the Covid-19 out­break and its eco­nomic fall­out.</p>
    <p>The BJP al­liance, which in­cluded the Janata Dal-United (JDU), emerged the winner in the tightly con­tested polls i n which the Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD), led by a 30-year-old po­lit­i­cal novice, mounted a cred­i­ble chal­lenge.</p>
    <p>The RJD-led al­liance, known as the Ma­ha­gath­band­han, un­der Mr Te­jashwi Ya­dav won 110 seats. Now re­garded as the po­lit­i­cal star in the elec­tion, his RJD emerged as the largest sin­gle party, se­cur­ing 75 seats in the 243-seat assem­bly.</p>
    <p>It was the BJP, how­ever, which was the big­gest winner, con­vert­ing its sta­tus from a ju­nior ally and a side player in Bihar pol­i­tics to grab cen­tre stage in the state.</p>
    <p>It helped pull the rul­ing Na­tional</p>
    <p>Demo­cratic Al­liance (NDA) to vic­tory. The NDA won 125 seats – three more than needed for a ma­jor­ity – with the BJP tak­ing 74 seats and the JDU 43.</p>
    <p>The out­come of the polls fol­lowed the na­tion­wide lock­down im­posed by Mr Modi which hit Bihar se­verely since hun­dreds of thou­sands of its mi­grant work­ers were left job­less and stranded through­out the coun­try. The state is among the poor­est in In­dia.</p>
    <p>The blow­back from the lock­down had an im­pact on JDU leader and long-time Bihar Chief Min­is­ter Nitish Ku­mar, who had to deal with anti-in­cum­bency sen­ti­ment among vot­ers an­gry with him for fail­ing to pro­tect the mi­grant work­ers.</p>
    <p>But an­a­lysts said the vote was also for the BJP and Mr Modi, although other fac­tors, in­clud­ing caste, played a role.</p>
    <p>“It’s in­creas­ingly clear that the Modi fac­tor and the BJP pro­pelled the vote in favour of the NDA in Bihar. The al­liance was pulled down by the JDU,” said po­lit­i­cal sci­en­tist San­deep Shas­tri.</p>
    <p>“Though un­em­ploy­ment and de­vel­op­ment were the main is­sues high­lighted, the same vot­ers be­lieved the NDA could solve all prob</p>
    <p>DEMOC­RACY STRENGTH­ENED</p>
    <p>lems re­lated to un­em­ploy­ment. The Ma­ha­gath­band­han (op­po­si­tion al­liance) was not able to con­vince vot­ers it could solve the prob­lem even though they raised the is­sue.”</p>
    <p>The RJD had promised 10 mil­lion jobs if it came to power.</p>
    <p>Dr Rahul Verma, a fel­low at the Cen­tre for Pol­icy Re­search, noted that Mr Modi had suc­cess­fully man­aged to con­vince vot­ers that he was do­ing his best dur­ing the coro­n­avirus out­break with a slew of wel­fare schemes for the poor.</p>
    <p>Bihar is part of the Hindi heart­land that has been the foun­da­tion of sup­port for the BJP. But the party has strug­gled for years to gain a big­ger foothold in the state. Mostly, it has had to pig­gy­back on the JDU which, along with a clutch of other re­gional par­ties, has held sway.</p>
    <p>The BJP’s po­lit­i­cal pres­ence has now been strength­ened in the state, which has more than 100 mil­lion peo­ple.</p>
    <p>Tweet­ing af­ter the re­sults were known, Mr Modi said that the poor and women in Bihar had helped the rul­ing al­liance to vic­tory.</p>
    <p>“To­day, Bihar has told the world again how democ­racy is strength­ened. A record num­ber of poor, de­prived and women of Bihar also voted and, to­day, have also given their de­ci­sive de­ci­sion for de­vel­op­ment,” Mr Modi tweeted in Hindi.</p>
    <p>“The poor in vil­lages, farm­ers, labour­ers, mer­chants, shop­keep­ers and ev­ery sec­tion of Bihar have re­lied on the NDA’s mantra of sabka saath, sabka vikas, sabka vish­was.”</p>
    <p>He was re­fer­ring to a BJP slo­gan in Hindi which trans­lates to “To­gether, for ev­ery­one’s growth, with ev­ery­one’s trust”.</p>
    <p>Still, the RJD has chal­lenged the re­sults even as the Elec­tion Com­mis­sion has de­nied any im­pro­pri­ety.</p>
    <p>While the Bihar vote is a boost to the BJP, the party faces tough state elec­tions next year in West Ben­gal,</p>
    <p>Tamil Nadu and Ker­ala, where re­gional par­ties are par­tic­u­larly strong.</p>
    <p>In Tamil Nadu, the main elec­toral battle is be­tween the rul­ing Dravida Mun­netra Kazhagam and the All In­dia Anna Dravida Mun­netra Kazhagam. The BJP is eye­ing an al­liance with the lat­ter.</p>
    <p>In West Ben­gal, the rul­ing Tri­namool Congress (TMC) led by Ms Ma­mata Ban­er­jee is mount­ing a ma­jor chal­lenge to the BJP.</p>
    <p>“I think the BJP will be buoyed. But in terms of West Ben­gal, it is a dif­fer­ent ball game. The TMC spread across the state is much wider, much stronger and more vis­i­ble as op­posed to the op­po­si­tion al­liance in Bihar,” said Dr Shas­tri.</p>
    <p>“And the BJP con­tin­ues to be a mar­ginal force in Tamil Nadu and Ker­ala. In Tamil Nadu, much will de­pend on al­liances that are formed.”</p>
    <p>To­day, Bihar has told the world again how democ­racy is strength­ened. A record num­ber of poor, de­prived and women of Bihar also voted and, to­day, have also given their de­ci­sive de­ci­sion for de­vel­op­ment.</p>
