    <p>Gone will be the “China virus” and “kung flu” slurs that United States Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump de­ployed to wildly cheer­ing crowds at his ral­lies; pub­lic rhetoric and mega­phone diplo­macy will be di­alled back.</p>
    <p>Con­ven­tional di­plo­matic di­a­logue will be put to­gether again, in ar­eas where the Joe Bi­den ad­min­is­tra­tion would like to work with China, not­with­stand­ing deeper and wider strate­gic com­pe­ti­tion.</p>
    <p>Arms sales to Tai­wan will con­tinue but there will be no se­nior­level vis­its to un­nec­es­sar­ily pro­voke China, Mr Bi­den’s ad­vis­ers say.</p>
    <p>Yet, while the tem­per­a­ture will be low­ered, those look­ing for signs of a re­ver­sal in the US’ ap­proach to China will be dis­ap­pointed.</p>
    <p>What a Bi­den ad­min­is­tra­tion will do is to re­fine and mod­er­ate the style, but the sub­stance of the US push­back against China will con­tinue, with the ad­min­is­tra­tion also ratch­et­ing up pres­sure on hu­man rights is­sues.</p>
    <p>MOD­ER­A­TION</p>
    <p>Mr Bi­den has al­ready sig­nalled a less stri­dent ap­proach. Asked on Thurs­day about pun­ish­ing China for al­low­ing the Covid-19 pan­demic to break out of the coun­try, he said: “It’s not so much about pun­ish­ing China, it’s about mak­ing sure China un­der­stands they’ve got to play by the rules. It’s a sim­ple propo­si­tion.”</p>
    <p>In the meet­ing with a bi­par­ti­san group of gov­er­nors in his home­town in Wilmington, Delaware, he said that is one of the rea­sons his ad­min­is­tra­tion is go­ing to re­join the World Health Or­gan­i­sa­tion and, on day one as well, the Paris cli­mate ac­cord.</p>
    <p>“And we have to make sure the rest of the world and we get to­gether and make sure there are cer­tain right lines the Chi­nese un­der­stand.</p>
    <p>“We have to not only deal with this pan­demic, we have to deal with the next one,” he added.</p>
    <p>Cer­tainly, there is a con­sen­sus in the US strate­gic com­mu­nity that the Chi­nese Com­mu­nist Party (CCP) – de­scribed this week by Mr Dan Blu­men­thal, di­rec­tor of Asian stud­ies at the con­ser­va­tive Amer­i­can En­ter­prise In­sti­tute, as a “Lenin­ist em­pire” – is the pri­mary strate­gic threat to the US.</p>
    <p>A State De­part­ment strat­egy pa­per ti­tled The El­e­ments Of The China Chal­lenge, soon to be re­leased but re­vealed by news web­site Ax­ios this week, warns in its pre­am­ble: “The CCP aims not merely at pre-em­i­nence within the es­tab­lished world or­der... but to fun­da­men­tally re­vise world or­der, plac­ing the Peo­ple’s Repub­lic of China at the cen­tre and serv­ing Bei­jing’s au­thor­i­tar­ian goals and hege­monic am­bi­tions.”</p>
    <p>The pa­per lays out 10 ways the US should ap­proach China, some of which are not dif­fer­ent from what Mr Bi­den’s ad­vis­ers pre­scribe.</p>
    <p>They in­clude, for in­stance, strength­en­ing its al­liance sys­tem, which the for­eign pol­icy strate­gists have al­ways seen as the US’ in­her­ent ad­van­tage, whether against Rus­sia or China.</p>
    <p>The US must “in co­op­er­a­tion with the world’s democ­ra­cies and other like-minded part­ners” re­form in­ter­na­tional or­gan­i­sa­tions where pos­si­ble and, where nec­es­sary, build new ones “rooted in free­dom, democ­racy, na­tional sovereignt­y, hu­man rights and the rule of law”, the strat­egy pa­per says.</p>
    <p>And it should “pro­mote Amer­i­can in­ter­ests by look­ing for op­por­tu­ni­ties to co­op­er­ate with Bei­jing, sub­ject to norms of fair­ness and rec­i­proc­ity”.</p>
    <p>STRONG HAND</p>
    <p>Mr Bi­den will in­herit a strong suite of mea­sures against China, in­clud­ing tar­iffs, curbs on tech­nol­ogy and in­vest­ments, curbs on visas for Chi­nese me­dia, and in­creased scru­tiny of stu­dents from China for state links.</p>
    <p>The US Navy is also flex­ing its mus­cles. Its Bat­tle Force 2045 plan en­vis­ages adding around 200 ships to its fleet. A strate­gic part­ner­ship with In­dia is so­lid­i­fy­ing. The Quadri­lat­eral Di­a­logue group­ing – In­dia, the US, Aus­tralia and Ja­pan – held its first joint naval ex­er­cises this month, fea­tur­ing all four pow­ers.</p>
    <p>Essen­tially, Mr Bi­den’s ad­vis­ers say, while there will be a marked shift in tone, there will be more con­ti­nu­ity than change in US pol­icy to­wards the Asia-Pa­cific in gen­eral.</p>
    <p>“Strat­egy is stronger than pol­i­tics. China pol­icy will con­tinue un­changed un­der Bi­den,” for­eign pol­icy guru and China ex­pert Ed­ward Luttwak pre­dicted on Wed­nes­day.</p>
    <p>COM­PE­TI­TION WITH­OUT CATAS­TRO­PHE</p>
    <p>It is about “com­pe­ti­tion with­out catas­tro­phe”, said Dr Pa­trick Cronin, Asia-Pa­cific se­cu­rity chair at Hud­son In­sti­tute. “The Bi­den ad­min­is­tra­tion aims to put a floor be­neath the US-China re­la­tion­ship as a ba­sis for mov­ing for­ward.”</p>
    <p>Apart from in­vest­ing in US fun­da­men­tals – work­ing with al­lies and part­ners, ad­vanc­ing network se­cu­rity – there will be two added el­e­ments, Dr Cronin told The Straits Times.</p>
    <p>“One of them is a re­newed strate­gic di­a­logue to avoid in­ad­ver­tent es­ca­la­tion, to ba­si­cally re­in­force co­ex­is­tence and avoid non-ex­is­tence,” he said.</p>
    <p>“The other is ar­eas of co­op­er­a­tion. And there may be more hope than re­al­ity, but from the pan­demic to cli­mate change to other is­sues, clearly there’s greater scope for co­op­er­a­tion than we’ve seen un­der the Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion.”</p>
    <p>Long-time Bi­den aide Antony Blinken, who is tipped to be sec­re­tary of state or na­tional se­cu­rity ad­viser, said at an event last month that the Bi­den ad­min­is­tra­tion would ac­tu­ally re­assert Amer­i­can lead­er­ship but act with some hu­mil­ity and con­fi­dence.</p>
    <p>“Amer­ica, at its best, still has a greater ca­pac­ity than any coun­try on earth to mo­bilise oth­ers in pos­i­tive, col­lec­tive ac­tion,” he said.</p>
    <p>“When we’re not en­gaged, when we’re not lead­ing, then one of two things (hap­pens): Ei­ther some other coun­try is and tries to take our place, but prob­a­bly not in a way that ad­vances our in­ter­ests and val­ues; or, maybe just as bad, no one is, and then you’ve got chaos, a vac­uum that tends to be filled by bad things be­fore it’s filled by good things, and, ei­ther way, bad for Amer­ica.”</p>
    <p>TEST FOR BI­DEN</p>
    <p>Mr Bi­den will have to con­tend with an ero­sion of trust in Amer­ica abroad in gen­eral, and in Asia, some wari­ness over hard po­si­tions on democ­racy and hu­man rights.</p>
    <p>At home, he has to deal with a deadly pan­demic and a se­verely frac­tured body politic. Dif­fer­ences even within the Demo­cratic Party have sur­faced al­ready.</p>
    <p>On Thurs­day, cli­mate and en­vi­ron­men­tal groups, along with New York City con­gress­woman Alexan­dria Oca­sio Cortez and other pro­gres­sive law­mak­ers, held a demon­stra­tion at the party’s of­fices in Wash­ing­ton, de­cry­ing Mr Bi­den’s hir­ing of staff with con­nec­tions to the oil and gas in­dus­try.</p>
    <p>In the case of China, much de­pends on how Bei­jing re­sponds and whether it tests Mr Bi­den.</p>
    <p>“Broad di­plo­matic en­gage­ment with China might have a prayer if we had a dif­fer­ent China, but we don’t,” said Dr James Carafano of the con­ser­va­tive Her­itage Foun­da­tion.</p>
    <p>“If there is a Bi­den ad­min­is­tra­tion and they try this, (China’s Pres­i­dent) Xi Jin­ping will eat their lunch.”</p>
