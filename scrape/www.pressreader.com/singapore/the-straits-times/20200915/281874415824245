    <p>Chief Cab­i­net Sec­re­tary Yoshi­hide Suga’s re­sound­ing win in yes­ter­day’s rul­ing party elec­tion to suc­ceed Prime Min­is­ter Shinzo Abe has fu­elled talk of a snap elec­tion to al­low the new leader to ce­ment his po­si­tion with a pub­lic man­date.</p>
    <p>Al­though Mr Suga dodged a ques­tion about this, Deputy Prime Min­is­ter Taro Aso and De­fence Min­is­ter Taro Kono have both said they ex­pect a snap elec­tion next month. A gen­eral elec­tion is due in Oc­to­ber next year.</p>
    <p>In his re­sponse to the ques­tion, Mr Suga drew at­ten­tion to the need to “over­come Covid-19 while stim­u­lat­ing the econ­omy” as he ex­pounded on the poli­cies he rolled out as Chief Cab­i­net Sec­re­tary and those he in­tended to as pre­mier.</p>
    <p>Read be­tween the lines of the non-com­mit­tal an­swer and it is clear that the pos­si­bil­ity of an early elec­tion can­not be ruled out.</p>
    <p>Mr Suga has said that he is in it for the long haul, and has “no in­ter­est in lead­ing an in­terim gov­ern­ment”.</p>
    <p>Al­ready, the Ja­panese me­dia is float­ing Oct 25 as a pos­si­ble snap elec­tion date.</p>
    <p>Deputy di­rec­tor at the Wil­son Cen­tre’s Asia Pro­gramme Shi­hoko Goto said: “It will be dif­fi­cult not to be seen as the head of a care­taker gov­ern­ment with­out be­ing supported by vot­ers, which means he would be un­der pres­sure to hold a snap elec­tion from the get-go.”</p>
    <p>Dr Sota Kato of the Tokyo Foun­da­tion for Pub­lic Re­search think-tank told The Straits Times: “Suga is too ca­pa­ble and am­bi­tious to re­main as an in­terim PM.</p>
    <p>To get out of this po­si­tion, he has to call an early elec­tion and ask vot­ers if they ap­prove of him as the leader of Ja­pan.”</p>
    <p>He noted that Mr Suga is en­joy­ing sky-high ap­proval rat­ings, rank­ing first as the pub­lic’s pre­ferred prime min­is­ter in at least four me­dia polls – and that it will be riskier to leave the elec­tion for later.</p>
    <p>Mr Suga was widely ex­pected to win yes­ter­day after hav­ing se­cured the back­ing of five of seven fac­tions in the lead­er­ship con­test of the rul­ing Lib­eral Demo­cratic Party (LDP). But he de­nied that he will pri­ori­tise Cab­i­net ap­point­ments ac­cord­ing to fac­tional sup­port, as has been tra­di­tion.</p>
    <p>Sophia Univer­sity po­lit­i­cal sci­en­tist Koichi Nakano, how­ever, told ST that Mr Suga faces in­her­ent risks in the de­sire to choose re­formists and sub­ject ex­perts for his Cab­i­net.</p>
    <p>“The fac­tion bosses will be think­ing that it is pay­back time, and will be covet­ing key po­si­tions,” Dr Nakano said. “De­pend­ing on his loy­alty, they may de­cide whether to sup­port him or un­seat him at the next LDP elec­tion.</p>
    <p>But... if Suga kow­tows to pres­sure, he will be crit­i­cised by the pub­lic as a pup­pet.”</p>
    <p>Mean­while, the margin of de­feat for for­mer de­fence chief Shigeru Ishiba in yes­ter­day’s vote might also sound the death knell for his prime min­is­te­rial am­bi­tions, an­a­lysts said.</p>
    <p>With 377 votes, Mr Suga was the run­away win­ner. For­mer for­eign min­is­ter Fu­mio Kishida, 63, who Mr Abe had un­til re­cently pub­licly backed as his cho­sen suc­ces­sor, came in sec­ond with 89 votes.</p>
    <p>In dead last, with 68 votes, was Mr Ishiba, in his fourth LDP lead­er­ship race after los­ing to Mr Abe in 2012, 2015 and 2018. He has a rep­u­ta­tion as a trou­ble­maker due to his fre­quent clashes with Mr Abe.</p>
    <p>Re­cent at­tempts to earn the sup­port of LDP stal­warts like sec­re­tary-gen­eral Toshi­hiro Nikai did not pay off.</p>
    <p>And, de­spite his rep­u­ta­tion for be­ing pop­u­lar among the grass­roots, he only man­aged to win 42 pre­fec­ture del­e­gate votes out of the 141 on of­fer. This is far fewer than the 89 that Mr Suga man­aged to score, even as most of the 47 pre­fec­tures held their own primaries to de­cide how to vote.</p>
    <p>“Kishida des­per­ately needed to come in sec­ond,” Dr Kato said. “He has been the favourite for sev­eral years and if he came in last, he would lose his cred­i­bil­ity as the PM can­di­date, not only to LDP mem­bers but to his fac­tion.”</p>
    <p>Both Dr Kato and Dr Nakano sus­pected there could have been be­hind-the-scenes ma­noeu­vring among the LDP law­mak­ers in Mr Abe’s and Mr Aso’s fac­tions to give votes to Mr Kishida, given that he had fared bet­ter than ex­pected.</p>
    <p>Dr Nakano said: “This is so as to put to rest Ishiba’s po­lit­i­cal for­tunes. Their main ob­jec­tive was for Suga to not just win, but win hand­somely. The sec­ond goal was to en­sure that Ishiba is not in a po­si­tion to chal­lenge. This is a very real hu­mil­i­a­tion for him.”</p>
    <p>Dr Kato, how­ever, did not write off Mr Ishiba’s chances.</p>
    <p>He said: “If the LDP loses pop­u­lar­ity and en­ters crisis mode, he has a chance as the LDP can turn to some­one who has been crit­i­cis­ing the main­stream lead­er­ship for a while.”</p>
    <p>Read be­tween the lines of the non-com­mit­tal an­swer and it is clear that the pos­si­bil­ity of an early elec­tion can­not be ruled out. Mr Suga has said that he is in it for the long haul, and has “no in­ter­est in lead­ing an in­terim gov­ern­ment”.</p>
