    <p>• In­dia and China share the world’s long­est dis­puted bor­der, at 3,440km. The dis­pute is in the eastern</p>
    <p>Ladakh re­gion, where the two sides have dif­fer­ences over where the Line of Ac­tual Con­trol lies on dif­fer­ent points of the de facto bor­der.</p>
    <p>• The cur­rent dis­pute is tak­ing place around Pan­gong Tso, a water body that en­com­passes an area nearly the same size as Sin­ga­pore. The lake cov­ers an area of 699.3 sq km, while Sin­ga­pore’s land size is 721.5 sq km.</p>
    <p>• It is the world’s high­est salt­wa­ter lake at a height of 4,350m. One-third of the lake lies in In­dia, while two-thirds is in China.</p>
    <p>• The dis­pute came to a boil in May and led to a high-al­ti­tude clash in the Gal­wan Val­ley on June 15 that left 20 In­dian sol­diers dead. China has not con­firmed any ca­su­al­ties.</p>
    <p>• Amid the height­ened ten­sions, both sides have de­ployed thou­sands of troops at Pan­gong Tso, as well as read­ied fighter jets, tanks and heavy weaponry.</p>
    <p>• Ten­sions mounted fur­ther late last month after In­dia staged its first of­fen­sive move of the con­flict, with troops mov­ing un­der the cover of night to oc­cupy strate­gic hill­tops.</p>
    <p>• Ear­lier this month, the two sides fired in the air to warn off each other’s troops, the first time shots have been fired in the bor­der re­gion for 45 years. That led to talks be­tween the two na­tions’ for­eign min­is­ters to de-es­ca­late the sit­u­a­tion.</p>
    <p>• In 2017, the two coun­tries had an­other high-al­ti­tude stand-off in Bhutan’s Dok­lam re­gion after In­dia sought to pre­vent China from con­struct­ing a road. The is­sue was re­solved after talks.</p>
    <p>• In­dia and China also have a dis­pute re­lated to the In­dian state of Arunachal Pradesh, which China claims as its own.</p>
    <p>• The Pan­gong Tso has been fea­tured in Bollywood movies, in­clud­ing The Three Id­iots, star­ring Aamir Khan.</p>
