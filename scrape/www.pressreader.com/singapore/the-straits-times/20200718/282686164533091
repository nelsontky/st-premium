    <p>I have a 12-year-old male cat (right). He loses hair, but it gen­er­ally grows back. But this time, the re­growth is tak­ing longer. Also, his eyes are wa­tery. His meals com­prise mainly dry food. K.S. Sankaran</p>
    <p>Does your cat show signs of itch­i­ness, es­pe­cially at the spot where there is hair loss? Is the spot where he loses hair the same ev­ery time and grow­ing big­ger? Or does the hair loss hap­pen at dif­fer­ent parts of the body?</p>
    <p>There are many causes of hair loss and these would be some of the ques­tions your vet may ask. En­sure that anti-par­a­sitic treat­ments are up to date for your cat.</p>
    <p>The hair loss at the flank of the body looks ex­ten­sive, al­though the spot does not look in­flamed.</p>
    <p>Take your cat to a vet for a thor­ough ex­am­i­na­tion to rule out com­mon causes such as par­a­sites and al­ler­gies. A blood test may also be nec­es­sary to rule out meta­bolic or in­fec­tious causes, which may also con­trib­ute to the hair loss.</p>
    <p>For eye dis­charge, there are many causes and it is im­por­tant to iden­tify if there are ac­com­pa­ny­ing res­pi­ra­tory signs. There are vi­ral and bac­te­rial dis­eases in cats that may re­sult in ocu­lar or nasal dis­charge, or both. A visit to the vet is rec­om­mended to rule out these in­fec­tious causes.</p>
    <p>Eye dis­charge usu­ally oc­curs when there is ir­ri­ta­tion to the eyes or if there is a tear drainage prob­lem. Ir­ri­ta­tion can arise from con­di­tions such as in­fec­tion, cer­tain eye dis­eases, trauma, re­ac­tion to ir­ri­tants such as al­ler­gens or dust, or eye­lash or eye­lid ab­nor­mal­i­ties.</p>
