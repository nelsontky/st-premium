    <p>I am an alum­nus of MacPher­son Sec­ondary School (MSS), which was built in 1967.</p>
    <p>In 2003, the school merged with Woodsville Sec­ondary School, and the merged en­tity started oper­at­ing in a new build­ing next door, while the old school com­pound was closed.</p>
    <p>In 2016, MSS alumni were in­vited to visit their alma mater and were given a guided tour of the new school build­ing’s lay­out and the fa­cil­i­ties within.</p>
    <p>We could see the vast in­vest­ments sunk into it and we ap­pre­ci­ated the Gov­ern­ment’s ef­forts in pro­vid­ing the best in ed­u­ca­tion.</p>
    <p>Yet, when I next vis­ited MSS this month, that school build­ing had been flat­tened to make way for a con­do­minium.</p>
    <p>The irony is that the old school build­ing built in 1967 is still standing, after 53 years. From 2003 un­til re­cent years, it had been used as a hold­ing school.</p>
    <p>In 2017, due to fall­ing en­rol­ment, MSS was merged with Broad­rick Sec­ondary School – this I can un­der­stand. But I had ex­pected the va­cated new build­ing to be re­con­fig­ured for other pur­poses. It was, after all, built only less than 20 years ago.</p>
    <p>A 2017 Straits Times ar­ti­cle re­ported In­ter­na­tional Prop­erty Ad­vi­sor’s chief ex­ec­u­tive Ku Swee Yong as say­ing that an ef­fi­cient use of space would be to make the build­ings avail­able for other ed­u­ca­tional needs, such as polytech­nic con­tin­u­ing ed­u­ca­tion classes for work­ing adults (Com­pounds left empty after schools merge, Feb 10, 2017).</p>
    <p>“This (could be) a fan­tas­tic chance for us to greatly ex­pand our ca­pa­bil­i­ties in ed­u­ca­tion,” he said.</p>
    <p>It was a sound sug­ges­tion for our pol­i­cy­mak­ers.</p>
    <p>The Skill­sFu­ture pro­gramme had just started two years be­fore that and all Sin­ga­pore­ans were en­cour­aged to up­skill and reskill. For it to suc­ceed, many pro­fes­sion­ally en­rich­ing cour­ses or train­ing pro­grammes were re­quired.</p>
    <p>Suit­able train­ing venues would also have been needed – well-equipped class­room set-ups, cen­tral in lo­ca­tion and, better still, near MRT sta­tions.</p>
    <p>The MSS build­ing would have been an ideal site.</p>
    <p>With the down­ward trend in Sin­ga­pore’s pop­u­la­tion growth, there will likely be fur­ther school clo­sures and merg­ers.</p>
    <p>I hope that va­cated school premises re­turned to the state will be given a new lease of life.</p>
    <p>De­mo­li­tion ought to be the last re­sort for build­ings that still have eco­nomic value.</p>
