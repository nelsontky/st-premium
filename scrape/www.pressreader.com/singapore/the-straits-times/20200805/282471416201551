    <p>You can get a copy of Mi­crosoft Of­fice 2019 for just $25, but is it gen­uine and le­git­i­mate?</p>
    <p>That is the ques­tion I tried to an­swer when I read The Straits Times ar­ti­cle head­lined “Shopee and Lazada re­move list­ings for unau­tho­rised Mi­crosoft soft­ware” last week.</p>
    <p>The same day the ar­ti­cle came out, I found dozens of cheap Mi­crosoft Of­fice offers on e-com­merce mar­ket­places Shopee and Lazada. Those deals were still around when I checked yes­ter­day morn­ing.</p>
    <p>Lazada seemed to have re­moved most of the cheaper deals fol­low­ing the pub­li­ca­tion of The Straits Times ar­ti­cle, but Shopee was still chock-full of them.</p>
    <p>So I bought a copy of the Mi­crosoft Of­fice 2019 Pro Plus pro­duc­tiv­ity suite (which comes with Word, Pow­erPoint, Ex­cel, OneNote, Pub­lisher, Out­look, Ac­cess and Skype for Busi­ness) for a cool $30 on Shopee.</p>
    <p>Upon pay­ment, the seller mes­saged me via Shopee chat, gave me a li­cence key and asked me to go to Mi­crosoft’s site (setup.of­fice.com) to reg­is­ter.</p>
    <p>I down­loaded the soft­ware from the site and was asked to link my Mi­crosoft ac­count. So far, so good – but when I tried to ac­ti­vate the li­cence key, I re­ceived an er­ror mes­sage in­di­cat­ing that the key had been ac­ti­vated too many times.</p>
    <p>I mes­saged the seller to clar­ify and he asked me to se­lect ac­ti­va­tion via phone in­stead of us­ing a li­cence key. When I clicked through to the phone ac­ti­va­tion menu, I saw a new set of codes which the seller asked me to share with him. Shortly af­ter that, he sent me an­other set of codes which he then asked me to type into the ac­ti­va­tion page.</p>
    <p>Voila! The prod­uct was suc­cess­fully ac­ti­vated. I tried the soft­ware and ev­ery­thing seemed to work with­out a hitch – it felt like a gen­uine copy of the Mi­crosoft Of­fice 2019 suite.</p>
    <p>But I was con­cerned with the round­about method of get­ting my prod­uct ac­ti­vated.</p>
    <p>I got in touch with Mi­crosoft</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore’s public re­la­tions folks.</p>
    <p>In an e-mail, I de­tailed my ex­pe­ri­ence, ask­ing if what I had bought was le­git­i­mate and how con­sumers could fig­ure out whether the ver­sions sold on Lazada and Shopee were le­git­i­mate. I also asked what would hap­pen to con­sumers who may have in­ad­ver­tently bought unau­tho­rised ver­sions of the soft­ware on Lazada and Shopee.</p>
    <p>The re­ply I got from Mi­crosoft – via its public re­la­tions agency here – didn’t ad­dress my ques­tions.</p>
    <p>What I got were es­sen­tially links to var­i­ous ar­ti­cles on Mi­crosoft’s web­site as well as non-com­mit­tal re­sponses such as this: “Gen­uine Mi­crosoft 365 and Of­fice is pub­lished by Mi­crosoft, prop­erly li­censed and sup­ported by Mi­crosoft or a trusted part­ner. Non-gen­uine soft­ware re­sults in a higher risk of mal­ware, fraud, public ex­po­sure of your per­sonal in­for­ma­tion and a higher risk for poor per­for­mance or fea­ture mal­func­tions.”</p>
    <p>Mi­crosoft did not ask me for more de­tails about my pur­chase. Un­able to get my an­swers, I turned to three friends who are vet­eran in­tel­lec­tual prop­erty lawyers here. Our chat led us to con­clude that I might have pur­chased a gen­uine but not prop­erly li­censed ver­sion of the soft­ware.</p>
    <p>In other words, the soft­ware works per­fectly and is not a coun­ter­feit prod­uct. But, judg­ing from the round­about way the soft­ware ac­ti­va­tion was done, I sus­pect the seller might not have had the right to sell the soft­ware to me, since con­sumer soft­ware li­cences are typ­i­cally non-trans­fer­able.</p>
    <p>Still, I might well be able to use the soft­ware for eter­nity and Mi­crosoft might never dis­cover that I am an “un­li­censed” user. But if Mi­crosoft does find out, it could legally ter­mi­nate a user’s ac­cess to the soft­ware and even po­ten­tially sue him or her for us­ing the unau­tho­rised prod­uct.</p>
    <p>My lawyer friends, how­ever, felt the user would be safe from crim­i­nal pros­e­cu­tion. But they said the seller might well be li­able for copy­right in­fringe­ment of­fences, in ac­cor­dance with s136 (3A) of the Copy­right Act, which car­ries a max­i­mum fine of $20,000 and/or im­pris­on­ment of up to six months.</p>
    <p>Now, price can­not be a fac­tor in de­ter­min­ing le­git­i­macy. There are many cheap deals on e-com­merce sites and that is one rea­son why con­sumers go there. Fake goods can also be sold at high prices to make them look real.</p>
    <p>The copy that I bought ap­pears to not have been prop­erly li­censed, but that does not mean every e-com­merce site deal is the same. In fact, it is a Her­culean task to make sense of all the dif­fer­ent deals for con­sumers.</p>
    <p>The prob­lem is that Mi­crosoft sells dif­fer­ent ver­sions of Of­fice to dif­fer­ent users. Ac­cord­ing to its web­site, there are three ver­sions of Mi­crosoft Of­fice for con­sumers and five for busi­ness users – and these are only the pub­lished deals.</p>
    <p>There are also special deals for schools, large cor­po­ra­tions and soft­ware de­vel­op­ers that most peo­ple do not know about. There is even some­thing called vol­ume li­cens­ing, which offers dis­counts when li­cences are pur­chased in bulk.</p>
    <p>I can un­der­stand that it is tough for Mi­crosoft to track the le­git­i­mate use of all these dif­fer­ent soft­ware li­cences. But it is even harder for con­sumers to fig­ure out whether the deals on these e-com­merce sites are for real or if they are duds. While I may sus­pect that a seller is not au­tho­rised, I can­not know for sure.</p>
    <p>What can a con­sumer do? Avoid cheap deals, miss out on the chance to buy le­git­i­mate dis­counted soft­ware and buy only from Mi­crosoft di­rectly?</p>
    <p>At the end of the day, Mi­crosoft needs to do more to help con­sumers make the right de­ci­sion. And that means it needs to do more than just give woolly re­sponses to gen­uine at­tempts by the me­dia to make bet­ter sense of the murky wa­ters of soft­ware li­cens­ing.</p>
    <p>• Oo Gin Lee was pre­vi­ously a tech ed­i­tor of The Straits Times and a big fan of Mi­crosoft Of­fice ever since he dis­cov­ered Mi­crosoft Word in the early 1990s when most of the world was still on WordPer­fect.</p>
