    <p>Play­ers in the Sin­ga­pore Premier League (SPL) took an­other step to­wards a re­turn to ac­tion when they un­der­went swab test­ing for Covid-19 yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Foot­ballers from all eight lo­cal-based sides – Balestier Khalsa, Gey­lang In­ter­na­tional, Hougang United, Lion City Sailors, Tampines Rovers, Tan­jong Pa­gar United, Young Lions, and Ja­panese out­fit Al­birex Ni­igata – were tested at the for­mer Siglap Sec­ondary School in Pasir Ris, as were SPL match of­fi­cials.</p>
    <p>Coaches and team of­fi­cials at each of these clubs were not tested as they are ex­pected to re­main masked up dur­ing games.</p>
    <p>The ninth team in the SPL are de­fend­ing cham­pi­ons DPMM, who are based in Brunei.</p>
    <p>The SPL, Sin­ga­pore’s only pro­fes­sional sports league, has been sus­pended since March 24 ow­ing to the coro­n­avirus pan­demic, with clubs re­sum­ing full train­ing only on Sept 1.</p>
    <p>The Straits Times re­ported last month that a re­turn this Satur­day is on the cards, sub­ject to all test re­sults com­ing back neg­a­tive.</p>
    <p>How­ever, sources tell ST there is a like­li­hood of a slight de­lay to the SPL’s re­sump­tion, as the re­sults from the first round of test­ing are ex­pected to ar­rive only mid­week, leav­ing teams with barely 48 hours to pre­pare for a first game back in al­most seven months.</p>
    <p>SPL coaches ST spoke to feel a longer run-up is needed be­fore the first match.</p>
    <p>“Oct 10 would be too rushed,” said Balestier Khalsa coach Marko Kral­je­vic.</p>
    <p>“If you de­lay the restart to the fol­low­ing week, we would have 10 days, and that would be just nice.</p>
    <p>“We need to know (early) when our first game back is, so that we know when to push the boys phys­i­cally, when to rest them, when to work on tech­ni­cal things, and when to work on the tac­ti­cal side of things.”</p>
    <p>Agree­ing, Hougang coach Cle­ment Teo added: “We don’t even know what the fix­tures (fre­quency) are like, and we don’t know who we’re play­ing yet, so how do we pre­pare?”</p>
    <p>Most lead­ing overseas leagues such as the English Premier League (EPL) and Ital­ian Serie A, among oth­ers, con­duct reg­u­lar test­ing for Covid-19 among play­ers and of­fi­cials.</p>
    <p>In the EPL, where fans are still not al­lowed into sta­di­ums, play­ers are tested weekly.</p>
    <p>Manch­ester City play­ers Riyad Mahrez, Aymeric La­porte and Ilkay Gun­do­gan, Liver­pool duo Thi­ago Al­can­tara and Sa­dio Mane, West Ham man­ager David Moyes and two of his play­ers, are among those who have tested pos­i­tive since the new sea­son be­gan on Sept 12.</p>
    <p>EPL play­ers or club staff who have tested pos­i­tive for coro­n­avirus will self-iso­late and quar­an­tine for a pe­riod of 10 days. Those who show symp­toms of Covid-19 but test neg­a­tive are also re­quired to self-iso­late.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to Premier League rules, fix­tures will go ahead as planned as long as teams have 14 pro­fes­sional play­ers avail­able for se­lec­tion.</p>
    <p>In the Ital­ian Serie A, if 10 play­ers test pos­i­tive within a week, a club can re­quest the post­pone­ment of a match. How­ever, the re­quest can be granted only once in the sea­son.</p>
    <p>The new sea­son got un­der way on Sept 19 with a max­i­mum of 1,000 spec­ta­tors al­lowed into sta­di­ums.</p>
    <p>In the SPL, Covid-19 tests will be con­ducted ev­ery fort­night and games will be played with­out fans. Pre­cau­tions in place will be sim­i­lar to when the league moved to closed-door matches shortly be­fore its sus­pen­sion.</p>
    <p>There will also likely be changes to the for­mat of do­mes­tic league and Cup com­pe­ti­tions, with a view to re­duc­ing the to­tal num­ber of games played. Orig­i­nally, each club in the nine-team league was sched­uled to play one an­other thrice.</p>
    <p>There are still ques­tion marks over the par­tic­i­pa­tion of Brunei DPMM, with the team’s head coach Adrian Pen­nock telling ST the sit­u­a­tion was “out of their hands” as they have yet to re­sume full train­ing.</p>
