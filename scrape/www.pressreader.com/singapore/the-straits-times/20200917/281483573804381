    <p>The let­ters which North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and United States Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump ex­changed after their his­toric meet­ing in Sin­ga­pore in 2018 were ef­fu­sive in their praise of each other, in­ves­tiga­tive jour­nal­ist Bob Wood­ward wrote in a book re­leased on Tues­day.</p>
    <p>Mr Kim’s let­ters were mas­ter­pieces of ver­bose flat­tery that bor­dered on ro­man­tic prose, wrote Mr Wood­ward, a vet­eran jour­nal­ist best known for his re­port­ing on the Water­gate scan­dal that even­tu­ally led to then US Pres­i­dent Richard Nixon’s res­ig­na­tion in 1974.</p>
    <p>Rage, his sec­ond book on the Trump pres­i­dency, was based on 18 in­ter­views with Mr Trump. He was shown 27 let­ters be­tween Mr Trump and Mr Kim, 25 of which had not been re­ported on before.</p>
    <p>The new de­tails on the let­ters of­fered a fresh in­sight on the bond be­tween the two lead­ers at the time, which pro­vided the mo­men­tum for US-North Korea diplo­macy. Progress has since stalled, with crit­ics then and now ar­gu­ing that the lead­ers’ three meet­ings were flashy but of lit­tle sub­stance.</p>
    <p>“Florid and grandil­o­quent, they trace how the two forged a per­sonal and emo­tional bond,” wrote Mr Wood­ward.</p>
    <p>“Trump has per­son­ally said they are ‘love let­ters’. They are more than that – they re­veal a de­ci­sion by both to be­come friends. Whether gen­uine or not, prob­a­bly only his­tory will tell.”</p>
    <p>US in­tel­li­gence an­a­lysts could not con­clude who penned the let­ters that came from Mr Kim, but they “mar­velled at the skill some­one brought to find­ing the ex­act mix­ture of flat­tery while ap­peal­ing to Trump’s sense of grandios­ity and be­ing cen­tre stage in his­tory”, wrote Mr Wood­ward.</p>
    <p>The Sin­ga­pore Sum­mit on June 12, 2018, was cru­cial, Mr Trump told Mr Wood­ward. “We re­ally got along. It was a great chem­istry,” he said.</p>
    <p>In a Christ­mas let­ter half a year after the sum­mit, Mr Kim de­scribed the meet­ing as “rem­i­nis­cent of a scene from a fan­tasy film”.</p>
    <p>He wrote: “Even now I can­not for­get that mo­ment of his­tory when I firmly held Your Ex­cel­lency’s hand at the beau­ti­ful and sa­cred lo­ca­tion as the whole world watched with great in­ter­est and hope to re­live the hon­our of that day.”</p>
    <p>Mr Wood­ward ob­served that the two lead­ers often por­trayed their di­plo­matic re­la­tions as an us­against-the-world ef­fort, as they dis­cussed the give-and-take of de­nu­cle­ari­sa­tion.</p>
    <p>At least twice after the Sin­ga­pore Sum­mit, Mr Trump told Mr Kim in let­ters that they were the only ones who could end the hos­til­ity be­tween their coun­tries, laud­ing their “unique style and a spe­cial friend­ship” and pledg­ing that Mr Kim would al­ways be his friend.</p>
    <p>They met for a sec­ond time in Hanoi. After their third meet­ing, an im­promptu but his­toric sum­mit at the bor­der of North Korea and South Korea on June 30 last year, Mr Trump sent a let­ter to Mr Kim, prais­ing him and the success of the meet­ing.</p>
    <p>He at­tached a copy of the front page of The New York Times, which fea­tured a large pic­ture of the two lead­ers, and wrote in marker pen: “Chair­man, great pic­ture of you, big time.”</p>
    <p>Two days later, Mr Trump wrote again, this time at­tach­ing 22 pho­to­graphs of their meet­ing with his let­ter.</p>
    <p>But by the time Mr Kim replied more than a month later on Aug 5, re­la­tions ap­peared to have cooled, with the North Korean leader up­set that US-South Korea mil­i­tary ex­er­cises had not fully stopped.</p>
    <p>In this let­ter, Mr Kim was po­lite but “sounded like a dis­ap­pointed friend or lover”, wrote Mr Wood­ward.</p>
    <p>Weigh­ing in on the Trump-Kim re­la­tion­ship on Tues­day, Mr Wood­ward re­marked on “the na­ture of how they talked and how they leaned on each other and how they main­tained they were friends and trusted each other”.</p>
    <p>It was an in­ter­est­ing, orig­i­nal ex­per­i­ment in diplo­macy, he said at a vir­tual event hosted by the Wash­ing­ton Post, where he is an as­so­ciate ed­i­tor.</p>
    <p>“They did charm each other,” he said. “Trump felt very much that it worked, we didn’t have war. You have to give him credit, at this point there’s been no war.</p>
    <p>“We don’t know where this is go­ing to go. The re­la­tion­ship be­tween Trump and Kim Jong Un is not good now, there’s a lot of ten­sion, so we will watch that.”</p>
    <p>Mr Wood­ward also noted that in his in­ter­view with Mr Trump on the Sin­ga­pore Sum­mit, he had to bring the Pres­i­dent’s fo­cus away from the pub­lic re­la­tions ex­trav­a­ganza to the sub­stance of the meet­ing.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump re­counted that he was deeply im­pressed by the wall of cam­eras when he first met and shook hands with Mr Kim at the Capella Ho­tel on Sen­tosa Is­land, Mr Wood­ward wrote. He claimed it was among the largest num­ber of cam­eras he had seen in his life, even more than at the Acad­emy Awards in Hol­ly­wood.</p>
    <p>He said: “You know, it was the most cam­eras. I think I’ve seen more cam­eras than any hu­man be­ing in his­tory. There’s like hun­dreds of them. It’s free. I get it for free. It costs me noth­ing. It’s called earned me­dia.”</p>
    <p>The new de­tails on the let­ters of­fered a fresh in­sight on the bond be­tween the two lead­ers at the time, which pro­vided the mo­men­tum for US-North Korea diplo­macy. Progress has since stalled, with crit­ics then and now ar­gu­ing that the lead­ers’ three meet­ings were flashy but of lit­tle sub­stance.</p>
