    <p>In Bangladesh yes­ter­day, tens of thou­sands of pro­test­ers marched through Dhaka urg­ing peo­ple to boy­cott French goods. The po­lice es­ti­mated that over 40,000 peo­ple took part in the march or­gan­ised by an Is­lamist party. Turk­ish Pres­i­dent Re­cep Tayyip Er­do­gan has also called on his com­pa­tri­ots to snub French goods.</p>
    <p>•</p>
    <p>ANKARA Turk­ish Pres­i­dent Re­cep Tayyip Er­do­gan has called for Turks to boy­cott French goods and urged Euro­pean Union lead­ers to halt French leader Em­manuel Macron’s “anti-Is­lam” agenda.</p>
    <p>For a third day run­ning, Mr Er­do­gan on Mon­day said Mr Macron needed a men­tal health check – re­peat­ing a re­buke that led France to re­call its am­bas­sador from Ankara over the week­end – as he ap­pealed to Turks to shun French prod­ucts.</p>
    <p>“Just like they say ‘ Don’t buy goods with Turk­ish brands’ in France, I am call­ing all my cit­i­zens from here to never help French brands or buy them,” he said.</p>
    <p>France is the 10th big­gest source of im­ports into Turkey and the sev­enth big­gest mar­ket for Turk­ish ex­ports, ac­cord­ing to Turkey’s sta­tis­ti­cal in­sti­tute. Among ma­jor French im­ports, au­tos are among the high­est-sell­ing cars in Turkey.</p>
    <p>“Euro­pean lead­ers with fore­sight and morals must break down the walls of fear,” Mr Er­do­gan said at the start of a week of ac­tiv­i­ties in Turkey to com­mem­o­rate the birth­day of Prophet Muham­mad.</p>
    <p>“They must put an end to the anti-Is­lam agenda and hate cam­paign that Macron is lead­ing.”</p>
    <p>Late on Mon­day, the French em­bassy in Ankara is­sued a warn­ing to French na­tion­als liv­ing and trav­el­ling in Turkey to ex­er­cise “great vig­i­lance” due to the “lo­cal and in­ter­na­tional” con­text, urg­ing them to avoid any gath­er­ing or demon­stra­tion in pub­lic places.</p>
    <p>Pres­i­dent Macron has pledged to fight “Is­lamist sep­a­ratism”, say­ing it was threat­en­ing to take over some Mus­lim com­mu­ni­ties in France. The coun­try has been shaken by the be­head­ing of a teacher by an Is­lamist mil­i­tant, aveng­ing the use of car­toons of the Prophet in a class.</p>
    <p>French teacher Sa­muel Paty was killed by a Chechen teenager on Oct 16 af­ter show­ing car­toons of the Prophet in a dis­cus­sion on free­dom of speech.</p>
    <p>Any de­pic­tion of the Prophet is for­bid­den in Is­lam.</p>
    <p>Turkey and France, both mem­bers of the Nato mil­i­tary al­liance, have been at odds over is­sues in­clud­ing Syria and Libya, mar­itime ju­ris­dic­tion in the east­ern Mediter­ranean and the con­flict in NagornoKar­abakh.</p>
    <p>Mr Macron has been the tar­get of protests in sev­eral other Mus­lim­ma­jor­ity na­tions over his com­ments fol­low­ing Mr Paty’s be­head­ing.</p>
    <p>In Bangladesh yes­ter­day, tens of thou­sands of pro­test­ers marched through the cap­i­tal Dhaka urg­ing peo­ple to boy­cott French prod­ucts.</p>
    <p>Po­lice es­ti­mated that more than 40,000 peo­ple took part in the march or­gan­ised by an Is­lamist party that was halted be­fore it could get close to the French em­bassy. Pro­test­ers chant­ing “Boy­cott French prod­ucts” and call­ing for Mr Macron to be pun­ished choked the streets.</p>
    <p>Hun­dreds of po­lice de­ployed a barbed wire bar­ri­cade across a road about 5km from the em­bassy to stop them from ad­vanc­ing.</p>
    <p>Be­fore break­ing up, one group doused an ef­figy with a Macron face in kerosene and set it ablaze, shout­ing anti-French slo­gans.</p>
    <p>The rally was or­gan­ised by Is­lami An­dolan Bangladesh, one of the largest Is­lamist par­ties in the Mus­lim-ma­jor­ity coun­try of 168 mil­lion peo­ple. The party has called for more na­tion­wide protests to take place to­mor­row and on Fri­day.</p>
    <p>“Macron is one of the few lead­ers who wor­ship Satan,” Mr Ataur Rah­man, a se­nior Is­lami An­dolan leader, told the rally.</p>
    <p>He called on the Bangladesh gov­ern­ment to ex­pel the French am­bas­sador while another leader said ac­tivists would “tear down ev­ery brick” of the em­bassy if the en­voy was not or­dered out.</p>
    <p>“France is the en­emy of Mus­lims. Those who rep­re­sent them are also our en­e­mies,” said Mr Ne­sar Ud­din, another leader from the group.</p>
    <p>Po­lice said that ex­tra forces were pa­trolling around the French em­bassy in the diplo­matic district.</p>
    <p>France is a ma­jor trade part­ner of Bangladesh, whose gar­ment fac­to­ries sell ap­parel worth bil­lions of dol­lars to French brands. La­farge, the world’s top ce­ment maker, is one of the largest French in­vestors in Bangladesh.</p>
    <p>There have been sev­eral vi­o­lent Is­lamist in­ci­dents in Bangladesh in re­cent years. A group linked to the Is­lamic State in Iraq and Syria killed at least 17 for­eign­ers, in­clud­ing seven Ital­ians and nine Ja­panese, in an at­tack on a Dhaka cafe in July 2016.</p>
