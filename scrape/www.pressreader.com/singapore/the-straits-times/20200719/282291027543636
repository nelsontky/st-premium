    <p>The cir­cuit breaker with its up­heaval of rou­tines was an anx­ious time for the Gupta fam­ily.</p>
    <p>Mr Nikhil Gupta, 41, an as­so­ci­ate di­rec­tor in the IT sec­tion of a bank, had to get used to work­ing from home.</p>
    <p>Screen time shot up to al­most nine hours a day for his two chil­dren, Aayan, 12, and Kaira, seven, who had to do home-based learn­ing and tu­ition on­line, and could not go down­stairs to play in the evenings as they used to.</p>
    <p>Stay-at-home mother Pooja Kawa­tra was cook­ing more than ever.</p>
    <p>Mr Gupta sug­gested the whole fam­ily take up med­i­ta­tion to de­stress, a tech­nique that had worked for him and his wife in the past.</p>
    <p>Ms Kawa­tra, 41, who is the founder of the Mums & Ba­bies par­ent­ing blog, was di­ag­nosed with non-Hodgkin’s lym­phoma in 2009.</p>
    <p>She says prac­tis­ing med­i­ta­tion to­gether had helped the cou­ple with their emo­tional well-be­ing on the “roller coaster ride” of can­cer.</p>
    <p>They were wor­ried at first about the kids pro­claim­ing they were bored, a fre­quent re­frain dur­ing the shut-in pe­riod.</p>
    <p>Daugh­ter Kaira would ask what to do when she closed her eyes, but her par­ents soon found that she was ea­ger to fol­low what her el­der brother Aayan did.</p>
    <p>Aayan kept the fam­ily on track by mak­ing sure they med­i­tated ev­ery night.</p>
    <p>The breath­ing ex­er­cises helped him to sleep bet­ter, he says.</p>
    <p>Ms Kawa­tra re­counts: “I didn’t want to force it on them. It’s the same ef­fect when you ask them to eat veg­gies. If you force them, they won’t like it. If you of­fer veg­eta­bles to them ev­ery day, it may work. Once they ac­cepted it, it be­came a rou­tine.”</p>
    <p>Med­i­ta­tion has helped build a “calm home life” that is good for men­tal health dur­ing the pan­demic, she says.</p>
    <p>The fam­ily still try to do at least 20 min­utes of med­i­ta­tion be­fore bed­time daily, seated near the Hi­malayan salt lamp on their liv­ing room floor, even though Kaira some­times gets wrig­gly 10 min­utes in.</p>
