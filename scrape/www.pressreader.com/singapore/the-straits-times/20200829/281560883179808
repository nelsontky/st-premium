    <p>Ja­panese Prime Min­is­ter Shinzo Abe said yes­ter­day that he saw no choice but to re­sign over his wors­en­ing med­i­cal con­di­tion. He said he found it “gut-wrench­ing” to quit dur­ing the Covid-19 cri­sis, and be­fore achiev­ing goals such as re­solv­ing a decades-old ab­duc­tion is­sue with North Korea.</p>
    <p>His qua­ver­ing voice be­tray­ing his stoic front, Ja­panese Prime Min­is­ter Shinzo Abe said yes­ter­day that he saw no choice but to re­sign over his wors­en­ing med­i­cal con­di­tion.</p>
    <p>“It has reached a point where I do not know if I can live up to the ex­pec­ta­tions of cit­i­zens,” Mr Abe, who is three weeks shy of his 66th birth­day, said.</p>
    <p>He said his phys­i­cal strength is not in top shape as he re­ceives treat­ment for his ill­ness – ul­cer­a­tive col­i­tis – and he wants to avoid “a sit­u­a­tion where I make an er­ror on po­lit­i­cal de­ci­sions and fail to de­liver re­sults”. He also noted that there is no guar­an­tee of a cure.</p>
    <p>He said he found it painful to quit dur­ing the Covid-19 cri­sis, and be­fore achiev­ing his goals like re­solv­ing a decades-old ab­duc­tion is­sue with North Korea.</p>
    <p>But he said this is the best time to re­sign in or­der to avoid a “po­lit­i­cal vac­uum”, es­pe­cially if Covid-19 cases were to surge in the com­ing months.</p>
    <p>Mr Abe will stay on as prime min­is­ter un­til his suc­ces­sor is cho­sen from within the Lib­eral Demo­cratic Party (LDP) next month.</p>
    <p>His abrupt res­ig­na­tion drew mes­sages of sup­port for a speedy recovery from for­eign lead­ers like Ger­man Chan­cel­lor An­gela Merkel and Sin­ga­pore Prime Min­is­ter Lee Hsien Loong.</p>
    <p>China said Bei­jing will con­tinue work­ing with Tokyo to pro­mote bi­lat­eral ties while South Korea, which has had a con­tentious re­la­tion­ship with Ja­pan, ex­pressed re­gret at the sud­den res­ig­na­tion.</p>
    <p>Mr Abe is quit­ting more than a year ahead of sched­ule, with his term as LDP pres­i­dent set to ex­pire only in Septem­ber next year. A Lower House election is due only by next Oc­to­ber.</p>
    <p>This is the sec­ond time he is step­ping down pre­ma­turely over a flare-up of ul­cer­a­tive col­i­tis, a chronic in­flam­ma­tory bowel dis­ease that he has suf­fered from since he was a teenager.</p>
    <p>When he first quit in 2007 af­ter a year in charge, he be­came the first in a re­volv­ing door of lead­ers that saw six prime min­is­ters in six years un­til 2012. The pe­riod also saw the rul­ing LDP cede power to the nowde­funct Demo­cratic Party of Ja­pan for three years from 2009 to 2012.</p>
    <p>Mr Abe’s re­turn to power in De­cem­ber 2012 marked the start of ex­tended po­lit­i­cal sta­bil­ity. On Mon­day, he sur­passed his great-un­cle Eisaku Sato, who led Ja­pan for 2,798 un­in­ter­rupted days from 1964 to 1972, to be­come the premier with the long­est un­in­ter­rupted ten­ure.</p>
    <p>It was also on Mon­day that Mr Abe ce­mented his de­ci­sion to quit af­ter con­sult­ing his doc­tors, he said yes­ter­day. A re­lapse of his con­di­tion, which had been kept un­der con­trol with med­i­ca­tion, meant he is now on a new treat­ment that re­quires in­tra­venous in­jec­tions.</p>
    <p>The plan was such a well-kept se­cret that it sent rip­ples through Ja­pan’s po­lit­i­cal cir­cles, with even Cab­i­net min­is­ters and top aides within the LDP blind­sided.</p>
    <p>The res­ig­na­tion as prime min­is­ter – Mr Abe will re­main MP of his home­town con­stituency in the south-western pre­fec­ture of Ya­m­aguchi and in­tends to run in the next na­tional election – will in­ten­sify jock­ey­ing among po­ten­tial suc­ces­sors in the LDP.</p>
    <p>Among those who said they were keen on the top job yes­ter­day were for­mer de­fence min­is­ter Shigeru Ishiba, 63; for­mer for­eign min­is­ter Fu­mio Kishida, 63; and for­mer in­ter­nal af­fairs min­is­ter Seiko Noda, 59.</p>
    <p>Oth­ers, like De­fence Min­is­ter Taro Kono, 57, and En­vi­ron­ment Min­is­ter Shin­jiro Koizumi, 39, kept mum when asked.</p>
    <p>Mar­kets im­me­di­ately re­acted to news of Mr Abe’s res­ig­na­tion, with the Nikkei 225 plung­ing over 600 points, or 2.6 per cent, to 22,594, be­fore re­bound­ing to close 1.4 per cent, or 326 points, lower. The yen, con­sid­ered a safe haven in times of un­cer­tainty, ral­lied against the dol­lar, hit­ting 106.11 from 106.74.</p>
    <p>Mr Abe’s sup­port rat­ings have re­cently nose­dived over a se­ries of po­lit­i­cal scan­dals, and what has been judged to be poor han­dling of the coro­n­avirus cri­sis.</p>
    <p>Ja­panese Prime Min­is­ter Shinzo Abe will soon leave of­fice with the proud legacy of hav­ing be­come the na­tion’s long­est-serv­ing leader but re­luc­tantly, with plenty of un­fin­ished busi­ness.</p>
    <p>Still, he can look back on a host of ma­jor coups, in­clud­ing the piv­otal role he played in lead­ing the re­vised Trans-Pa­cific Part­ner­ship (TPP) trade pact to fruition af­ter the pullout of the United States.</p>
    <p>He also suc­ceeded in rein­ter­pret­ing Ja­pan’s se­cu­rity laws so as to en­able its mil­i­tary to ex­er­cise “col­lec­tive self-de­fence” to aid al­lies, and in spear­head­ing a Free and Open Indo-Pa­cific vi­sion.</p>
    <p>“Pol­i­tics is not about how many days one has stayed in of­fice, but what one has ac­com­plished,” Mr Abe told re­porters on Mon­day, when he over­took his great-un­cle Eisaku Sato’s 2,798 con­sec­u­tive days in power to achieve the long­est un­in­ter­rupted stretch as prime min­is­ter on record.</p>
    <p>But he would yes­ter­day ex­press deep re­gret and sor­row over “leav­ing of­fice with­out fin­ish­ing off the projects I had em­barked on”.</p>
    <p>Among th­ese is pre­sid­ing over Ja­pan dur­ing the Olympic Games, now post­poned to next year.</p>
    <p>Tokyo Olympic Or­gan­is­ing Com­mit­tee pres­i­dent Yoshiro Mori said Mr Abe had “led the van­guard in se­cur­ing Tokyo’s bid”, and hoped for his con­tin­ued sup­port re­gard­less of his po­si­tion.</p>
    <p>Mr Abe will also give up his dream of re­vis­ing the paci­fist Con­sti­tu­tion for the first time since it was en­acted af­ter World War II, a con­tro­ver­sial plan that has raised con­cerns do­mes­ti­cally and in­ter­na­tion­ally that it would be a slip­pery slope to­wards mil­i­tarism.</p>
    <p>While his “Abe­nomics” brand of mon­e­tary eas­ing, fis­cal spend­ing and struc­tural re­forms had helped to spur economic growth, the nascent suc­cess has been wiped out by the Covid-19 cri­sis that has pushed Ja­pan into a re­ces­sion and trig­gered its worst economic slump ever. He will also not ful­fil his goal of ink­ing a World War II peace treaty with Russia, with a res­o­lu­tion of the ter­ri­to­rial dis­pute over is­lands north of Hokkaido – known as the North­ern Ter­ri­to­ries in Ja­pan and the South­ern Kurils in Russia – still far from reach.</p>
    <p>He will not se­cure any break­through in the decades-old ab­duc­tions is­sue with North Korea, which had kid­napped Ja­panese cit­i­zens in the 1970s and 1980s.</p>
    <p>Ob­servers won­der if Mr Abe chose to re­sign at this time due to a lack of ideas, with the Mainichi daily writ­ing in an editorial this week that he “ap­pears as if he has lost his pur­pose”.</p>
    <p>His con­spic­u­ous ab­sence from the pub­lic eye since June – which co­in­cided with a re­lapse of ul­cer­a­tive col­i­tis, an in­flam­ma­tory bowel dis­ease that may be in­duced by stress – has led his Cab­i­net ap­proval rat­ings to free-fall.</p>
    <p>“Be­fore there started to be talk of his ill­ness, Abe has been in­vis­i­ble for so long and has been crit­i­cised for a se­ri­ous lack of lead­er­ship and for a se­ries of scan­dals,” Sophia Uni­ver­sity po­lit­i­cal sci­en­tist Koichi Nakano told The Straits Times.</p>
    <p>Among the scan­dals is the in­dict­ment of a hand­picked for­mer jus­tice min­is­ter on al­le­ga­tions of vote-buy­ing. A con­tro­ver­sial plan to ex­tend the re­tire­ment age of pros­e­cu­tors at the gov­ern­ment’s dis­cre­tion also back­fired, af­ter the in­tended ben­e­fi­ciary re­signed for play­ing mahjong for money dur­ing the Covid-19 state of emer­gency.</p>
    <p>Dr Sota Kato, a re­search direc­tor at The Tokyo Foun­da­tion for Pol­icy Re­search think-tank, said Mr Abe’s pro­longed ten­ure re­sulted in a con­cen­tra­tion of pol­i­cy­mak­ing pow­ers in the Prime Min­is­ter’s Of­fice. This has led to bet­ter pol­i­cy­mak­ing ef­fi­ciency but has also been blamed for crony­ism scan­dals al­legedly caused by bu­reau­crats try­ing to curry favour.</p>
    <p>Still, it is what he dubs as a “his­tor­i­cal turn­ing point” in Ja­pan’s pol­i­cy­mak­ing process that aided in Mr Abe’s TPP suc­cess.</p>
    <p>Dr Kato, for­merly an of­fi­cial at the Min­istry of Econ­omy, Trade and In­dus­try, told ST: “The po­lit­i­cal cli­mate had been such that I could never imag­ine the ad­min­is­tra­tion ever over­com­ing the strong op­po­si­tion of the farm lobby and the Min­istry of Agri­cul­ture,</p>
    <p>Forestry and Fish­eries to con­clude the TPP.”</p>
    <p>He won­ders if the change will be per­ma­nent or an aber­ra­tion.</p>
    <p>“There is a pre­vail­ing feel­ing that the next prime min­is­ter will not be as dom­i­nant a po­lit­i­cal fig­ure as Abe, who­ever it may be,” Dr Kato said, adding that fig­ures in Mr Abe’s camp like for­mer for­eign min­is­ter Fu­mio Kishida would favour con­ti­nu­ity, while oth­ers like for­mer de­fence min­is­ter Shigeru Ishiba might be prone to rip­ping up the play­book.</p>
