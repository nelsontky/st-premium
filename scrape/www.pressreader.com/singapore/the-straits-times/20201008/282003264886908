    <p>Sin­ga­pore has un­veiled a new plan to pro­tect its dig­i­tal sphere against cy­berthreats in­clud­ing cy­ber­crime – and not a moment too soon. Cy­ber­crime and other forms of on­line threats, in­clud­ing spy­ing and in­fras­truc­ture dis­rup­tion, have been on the in­crease glob­ally be­fore now. But the Covid-19 pan­demic has led to both a surge in cy­berthreats, and vul­ner­a­bil­i­ties to such threats, as it has driven much of hu­man ac­tiv­ity into cy­berspace – work­ing, learning and shop­ping in­cluded. When the pan­demic hit, com­pa­nies quickly sought to get their em­ploy­ees to work from home. Overnight, bil­lions around the world be­came re­mote work­ers. Many had lit­tle ex­pe­ri­ence do­ing so, or an aware­ness of the risks they might be open­ing them­selves up to through this in­creased on­line ac­tiv­ity. With home net­works less se­cure than of­fice ones and com­pa­nies hard­put to ramp up se­cu­rity, of­fice sys­tems and data be­come more vul­ner­a­ble to cyber at­tacks.</p>
    <p>Busi­nesses from banks to restau­rants to shops moved more of their trans­ac­tions on­line, as did gov­ern­ment agen­cies. All this cre­ated op­por­tu­ni­ties for cyber crim­i­nals to strike. And they did. Ac­cord­ing to one study, large-scale dig­i­tal at­tacks in­creased 273 per cent glob­ally in the first three months of this year alone. Cyber at­tacks can be costly to com­pa­nies and gov­ern­ments as incidents have shown. In June, Ja­panese au­to­mo­tive gi­ant Honda sus­pended some of its car and mo­tor­cy­cle pro­duc­tion af­ter ran­somware hit its in­ter­nal servers, in­clud­ing its pro­duc­tion sys­tems. That same month, an Amer­i­can city paid a ran­som of nearly US$300,000 (S$407,900) in bit­coin af­ter a cyber at­tack on its com­puter net­work sys­tem.</p>
    <p>Be­yond the pan­demic, new trends such as 5G net­works and the use of con­nected In­ter­net of Things de­vices will in­crease the vul­ner­a­bil­ity of dig­i­tal net­works to large-scale, multi-vec­tor at­tacks that re­quire holis­tic ap­proaches to cyber se­cu­rity to counter. Busi­nesses and gov­ern­ments on their own can­not deal with the im­pact of cy­ber­crime. They need to work to­gether. On this score, Sin­ga­pore has moved in the right di­rec­tion with its Safer Cy­berspace Mas­ter­plan 2020 that stresses a col­lec­tive re­sponse from the Gov­ern­ment, busi­nesses and in­di­vid­u­als to pro­tect dig­i­tal as­sets here.</p>
    <p>But a coun­try act­ing on its own is not enough as cy­ber­crime and threats are global in na­ture. In­ter­na­tional col­lab­o­ra­tion is needed. Some have sug­gested build­ing a global ar­chi­tec­ture to sup­port both small groups fo­cused on con­crete oper­a­tions and long-term align­ment, trust-build­ing and agenda-set­ting within the broader com­mu­nity. Un­for­tu­nately, with the world’s two largest economies in a tech war that threat­ens to split tech­nol­ogy and cyber-se­cu­rity stan­dards into two sep­a­rate sets, the chal­lenge of global col­lab­o­ra­tion has been made more daunt­ing.</p>
