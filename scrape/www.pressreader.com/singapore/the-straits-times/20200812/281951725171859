    <p>Smart home tech­nol­ogy has helped 26-year-old Is­abelle Lim, who is deaf, to live more in­de­pen­dently.</p>
    <p>The full-time pho­tog­ra­pher be­gan us­ing smart home de­vices last Septem­ber, and has an app that links her home’s smart door­bell and smart light­ing sys­tem.</p>
    <p>“I’ve pro­grammed the light to flicker when the door­bell rings so that I’m alerted when some­one is at the door.</p>
    <p>“This is es­pe­cially use­ful when a de­liv­ery­man comes by with my on­line pur­chases and food de­liv­ery or when our fam­ily and friends come over to our place,” said Ms Lim, who has Nager syn­drome, a rare ge­netic dis­or­der char­ac­terised by fa­cial and limb de­for­mi­ties.</p>
    <p>The light has also been pro­grammed to turn blue when it rains, so that Ms Lim is alerted to close the win­dows when her mother is not home.</p>
    <p>She lives with her par­ents, grand­mother and brother in a Hous­ing Board flat in the eastern part of Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>She also uses Google’s vir­tual as­sis­tant Nest Hub and stream­ing de­vice Chrome­cast, as well as the Kyla app for its in­frared blaster to con­trol ap­pli­ances that op­er­ate us­ing in­frared re­mote con­trols.</p>
    <p>Ms Lim was one of those in­volved in the de­vel­op­ment of a new on­line guide on smart home tech­nol­ogy that was launched this month for peo­ple with dis­abil­i­ties. It demon­strates ways the tech­nol­ogy can help them live, work and play with greater in­de­pen­dence.</p>
    <p>The Smart Home Guide, de­vel­oped by SG En­able in part­ner­ship with Google, ex­plains the ben­e­fits of smart home tech­nol­ogy, fea­tures se­lected de­vices and guides peo­ple with dis­abil­i­ties and their care­givers in set­ting up a sim­ple smart home ecosys­tem.</p>
    <p>Ex­am­ples of smart home tech in­clude vir­tual as­sis­tants that can listen to ver­bal or app com­mands to fol­low in­struc­tions or re­ply to ques­tions, as well as smart plugs that can be plugged into ex­ist­ing power sock­ets and con­trolled re­motely via a mo­bile app or voice com­mand.</p>
    <p>De­vel­op­ment of the guide started last year. SG En­able part­nered Google to in­stall smart home de­vices in the homes of three peo­ple with dif­fer­ent dis­abil­i­ties – vis­ual im­pair­ment, phys­i­cal dis­abil­ity and deaf­ness – to un­der­stand the ben­e­fits and po­ten­tial chal­lenges of us­ing smart home tech­nol­ogy.</p>
    <p>The three peo­ple cho­sen were clients of SG En­able and did not have to pay for the de­vices.</p>
    <p>SG En­able as­sis­tant chief ex­ec­u­tive Tan Ko We said: “For many of us, tech­nol­ogy brings con­ve­nience.</p>
    <p>“For per­sons with dis­abil­i­ties, tech­nol­ogy can play an even more cru­cial role in en­abling them to live, work and play more in­de­pen­dently.”</p>
    <p>Mr Tan added that peo­ple with dis­abil­i­ties as well as their care­givers can cus­tomise their homes with smart de­vices to suit their unique needs and make their homes more ac­ces­si­ble.</p>
    <p>Google Sin­ga­pore coun­try di­rec­tor Ben King said: “Ev­ery day, we wit­ness the trans­for­ma­tive power of tech­nol­ogy to bet­ter the way we live and ex­pe­ri­ence the world.</p>
    <p>“This is es­pe­cially ev­i­dent within the spe­cial needs com­mu­nity, as smart home tech­nol­ogy can help to pro­vide greater con­ve­nience and sup­port their in­de­pen­dence.”</p>
    <p>Mr Tan said: “Feed­back on the smart home de­vices was mostly pos­i­tive. How­ever, we recog­nised the need to build greater aware­ness of smart home tech­nol­ogy and its ben­e­fits.</p>
    <p>“Hence, this guide was de­vel­oped for per­sons with dis­abil­i­ties and care­givers who may be new to, or cur­rently un­fa­mil­iar with, smart home tech­nol­ogy.”</p>
    <p>There was feed­back that i nstalling too many de­vices at a time could be over­whelm­ing for users.</p>
    <p>The guide there­fore rec­om­mends that peo­ple buy and get used to two or three ba­sic de­vices first be­fore adding more, said Mr Tan.</p>
    <p>The de­vices in­cluded in the guide were cu­rated to keep over­all costs low, he added.</p>
    <p>For peo­ple with dis­abil­i­ties from low-in­come house­holds, the As­sis­tive Tech­nol­ogy Fund ad­min­is­tered by SG En­able pro­vides sub­si­dies.</p>
    <p>The guide can be down­loaded from the En­abling Guide web­site at www.en­abling­guide.sg/im-look­ing­for-dis­abil­ity-sup­port/as­sis­tivetech­nol­ogy/smart-home-at</p>
    <p>Peo­ple with vis­ual im­pair­ment can ac­cess the web­site and the guide with the use of screen read­ers or other as­sis­tive tech­nol­ogy.</p>
