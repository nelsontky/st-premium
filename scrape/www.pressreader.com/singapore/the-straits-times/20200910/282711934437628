    <p>HONG KONG Hong Kong ac­tress Rox­anne Tong, 33, has de­nied spec­u­la­tion that she has se­cretly mar­ried ac­tor Ken­neth Ma (both right), say­ing “no” three times on so­cial me­dia.</p>
    <p>The cou­ple ad­mit­ted they were dat­ing in June af­ter he was pho­tographed driv­ing to her house.</p>
    <p>The 46-year-old ac­tor pre­vi­ously dated Tong’s good friend, ac­tress Jacqueline Wong, be­fore they broke up last year af­ter Wong was caught kiss­ing mar­ried singer Andy Hui in a taxi.</p>
    <p>Ru­mours of a se­cret wed­ding sur­faced on Mon­day when Ma re­minded fans to tune in to Tong’s on­line broad­cast at 9pm that day.</p>
    <p>The cou­ple’s good friend, ac­tor Ed­win Siu, then com­mented: “Where to get such a good hus­band?”</p>
    <p>Per­haps re­al­is­ing it was a faux pas, he then wrote: “Sorry, it should be boyfriend” be­fore adding a “think­ing” emoji.</p>
    <p>His com­ment piqued the cu­rios­ity of ne­ti­zens, who asked if Ma and Tong have tied the knot.</p>
    <p>Tong then waded into the dis­cus­sion. But in­stead of cor­rect­ing him, she asked Siu: “Friend, are you too bored?”</p>
    <p>The spec­u­la­tion reached fever pitch on Tues­day as ne­ti­zens were re­minded of a sim­i­lar in­ci­dent two years ago.</p>
    <p>Siu, who was then known to be dat­ing ac­tress Priscilla Wong, let the cat out of the bag when he said “many thanks to my wife Priscilla Wong” dur­ing the TVB An­niver­sary Awards in 2018.</p>
    <p>Tong took to so­cial me­dia on Tues­day night to re­fute ru­mours of her mar­riage. She wrote: “No sud­den wed­ding. No, no, no. Need to say it three times for im­por­tant stuff.”</p>
    <p>Ma has so far not com­mented on the ru­mours.</p>
