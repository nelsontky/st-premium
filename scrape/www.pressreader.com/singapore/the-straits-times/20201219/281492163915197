    <p>Cab­bies will get at least $300 a month ex­tra rental relief from op­er­a­tors in the first half of next year, as de­mand is low. With separate govern­ment pay­outs, they will re­ceive a to­tal of al­most $5,000 in that pe­riod.</p>
    <p>Taxi drivers will get at least $300 a month in ad­di­tional rental relief from cab op­er­a­tors in the first half of next year, as the sec­tor con­tin­ues to be hit by low de­mand caused by the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>In­clud­ing the separate pay­outs that the Govern­ment has an­nounced, they will re­ceive a to­tal of al­most $5,000 from next month to June, said Se­nior Min­is­ter of State for Trans­port Amy Khor yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Ex­plain­ing the con­tin­ued aid for the sec­tor, Dr Khor said: “Tourism ac­tiv­i­ties re­main muted... and many em­ploy­ees are still con­tin­u­ing to work from home.</p>
    <p>“In fact, the com­mut­ing pat­tern has ac­tu­ally changed with shorter trips and there­fore lower fares.”</p>
    <p>She was speaking af­ter a visit to the Com­fortDelGro of­fice in Brad­dell Road.</p>
    <p>Com­fortDelGro Taxi chief ex­ec­u­tive Ang Wei Neng noted that while pas­sen­ger num­bers had grown to about 70 per cent of preCovid-19 lev­els, drivers were earn­ing less in fares.</p>
    <p>He said he hoped that the in­tro­duc­tion of Covid-19 vac­cines, as well as the re­open­ing of the econ­omy and bor­ders, would help to boost the prospects of drivers.</p>
    <p>Separately, the Land Trans­port Authority (LTA) this week an­nounced that drivers of pri­vate­hire cars and taxis will get $600 a month from Jan­uary to March next year, up from the $300 monthly they were ini­tially set to re­ceive.</p>
    <p>In ad­di­tion, the drivers will also get $450 from April to June.</p>
    <p>The in­creased pay­outs by the Govern­ment are meant to help cush­ion the im­pact of the Self-Em­ployed Per­son In­come Relief Scheme (Sirs) end­ing this year.</p>
    <p>The scheme had pro­vided self­em­ployed peo­ple with three quar­terly cash pay­outs of $3,000 each.</p>
    <p>Drivers had been able to use Sirs, as well as the Special Relief Fund, to boost their earn­ings.</p>
    <p>Dr Khor said yes­ter­day that the Govern­ment has dis­bursed about $120 mil­lion in pay­outs through the Special Relief Fund to about 40,000 taxi and pri­vate-hire car drivers as of end-Novem­ber.</p>
    <p>When asked if pri­vate-hire car op­er­a­tors such as Grab and Go­jek would be in­tro­duc­ing ad­di­tional rental relief sim­i­lar to that of­fered by taxi op­er­a­tors, Dr Khor said: “We con­tinue to work to­gether with the op­er­a­tors to en­cour­age them to con­tinue to sup­port the pri­vate-hire car drivers in what­ever way they can.”</p>
    <p>Labour MP Yeo Wan Ling, who is also a di­rec­tor at the Na­tional Trades Union Congress, said it has been meet­ing pri­vate-hire op­er­a­tors to let them know about the ini­tia­tives by taxi op­er­a­tors.</p>
    <p>She noted that the union has also worked with pri­vate-hire plat­forms on up­skilling drivers and equip­ping them with ex­per­tise to tran­si­tion to other in­dus­tries.</p>
    <p>Ride-hail­ing op­er­a­tor Grab said in re­sponse to queries that its ap­proach would “con­tinue to evolve with the sit­u­a­tion”. It said it had been fo­cus­ing on max­imis­ing earn­ing op­por­tu­ni­ties for its drivers.</p>
    <p>The Straits Times un­der­stands that Go­jek has no plans to in­tro­duce sub­si­dies sim­i­lar to that of taxi op­er­a­tors. But a spokesman said the firm re­mains com­mit­ted to help­ing drivers through in­cen­tive schemes and ben­e­fits.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, cab­bies said they are grate­ful for the ad­di­tional help.</p>
    <p>Com­fortDelGro taxi driver Frankie Chew, 52, ac­knowl­edged that the sub­si­dies which drivers will re­ceive next year will be lower with­out Sirs.</p>
    <p>How­ever, the sole bread­win­ner for his fam­ily of four is op­ti­mistic about the fu­ture.</p>
    <p>He said: “Sin­ga­pore is open­ing up and peo­ple are com­ing out.</p>
    <p>“The most dif­fi­cult challenge (dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker pe­riod) has al­ready passed, so we will def­i­nitely be able to pull through.”</p>
