    <p>The US has said it is es­tab­lish­ing a new bi­lat­eral eco­nomic di­a­logue with Tai­wan, an ini­tia­tive that is aimed at strength­en­ing ties with Taipei and sup­port­ing it in the face of in­creas­ing pres­sure from Bei­jing. Wash­ing­ton also said that it has de­clas­si­fied six Rea­gan-era se­cu­rity as­sur­ances given to Tai­wan.</p>
    <p>WASH­ING­TON • The US has said it is es­tab­lish­ing a new bi­lat­eral eco­nomic di­a­logue with Tai­wan, an ini­tia­tive that is aimed at strength­en­ing ties with Taipei and sup­port­ing it in the face of in­creas­ing pres­sure from Bei­jing.</p>
    <p>Wash­ing­ton also said it has de­clas­si­fied six Rea­gan-era se­cu­rity as­sur­ances given to Tai­wan, a move that an­a­lysts said ap­pears in­tended to show fur­ther sup­port for Taipei.</p>
    <p>Mon­day’s an­nounce­ments come at a time of ris­ing Chi­nese threats to­wards Tai­wan, and when re­la­tions be­tween Wash­ing­ton and Bei­jing are at a decades-low level.</p>
    <p>US Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump is cam­paign­ing for re-elec­tion in Novem­ber with a tough ap­proach to China among his key for­eign pol­icy plat­forms.</p>
    <p>The State Depart­ment’s top diplo­mat for East Asia, Mr David Stil­well, told a vir­tual fo­rum hosted by the con­ser­va­tive Her­itage Foun­da­tion that the lat­est US moves were not a pol­icy shift, but part of a set of “sig­nif­i­cant ad­just­ments” within Wash­ing­ton’s “one-China” pol­icy.</p>
    <p>Wash­ing­ton felt com­pelled to make these given the “in­creas­ing threat posed by Bei­jing to peace and sta­bil­ity” in a vi­tally im­por­tant re­gion and Bei­jing’s at­tempts to iso­late Tai­wan diplo­mat­i­cally while sub­ject­ing it to mil­i­tary threats.</p>
    <p>“We will con­tinue to help Taipei re­sist the Chi­nese Com­mu­nist Party’s cam­paign to pres­sure, in­tim­i­date, and marginalis­e Tai­wan,” Mr Stil­well said.</p>
    <p>Tai­wan’s For­eign Min­istry ex­pressed thanks for the show of sup­port at a time when it said China was us­ing mil­i­tary in­tim­i­da­tion to dam­age peace and sta­bil­ity near Tai­wan, and said it would con­tinue to strengthen its de­fence ca­pa­bil­i­ties.</p>
    <p>In Bei­jing, Chi­nese For­eign Min­istry spokesman Hua Chun­y­ing said no­body should un­der­es­ti­mate China’s re­solve to de­fend its sovereignt­y, and urged the United States to stop el­e­vat­ing its re­la­tions with Tai­wan.</p>
    <p>The US, like most coun­tries, has of­fi­cial ties with Bei­jing, but not Tai­wan, which is claimed by China as its ter­ri­tory. But the US is bound by law to help Tai­wan de­fend it­self and is its main arms sup­plier.</p>
    <p>Mr Daniel Rus­sel, a pre­de­ces­sor of Mr Stil­well un­til early in the Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion, said the “Six As­sur­ances” made to Taipei by then Pres­i­dent Ron­ald Rea­gan’s ad­min­is­tra­tion had been a “loosely-kept se­cret” at best.</p>
    <p>He said the move to pub­lish them looked like a com­pro­mise re­sponse to pres­sure from ad­min­is­tra­tion hawks to aban­don “strate­gic am­bi­gu­ity” – a long-stand­ing pol­icy of with­hold­ing a clear-cut US com­mit­ment to de­fend Tai­wan while still show­ing suf­fi­cient sup­port to de­ter any Chi­nese mil­i­tary ad­ven­tur­ism.</p>
    <p>Among the as­sur­ances made in 1982, but never for­mally made pub­lic, are state­ments that the US has not set a date for end­ing arms sales to Tai­wan, nor agreed to prior con­sul­ta­tion with Bei­jing on such sales.</p>
    <p>Former US rep­re­sen­ta­tive to Tai­wan Dou­glas Paal said the move ap­peared largely for show. “My guess is that Stil­well and the ad­min­is­tra­tion want to look tough... So they are walk­ing close to China’s red lines, but re­main un­will­ing to cross them,” he said.</p>
    <p>Mr Stil­well said the eco­nomic di­a­logue would “ex­plore the full spec­trum of our eco­nomic re­la­tion­ship – semi­con­duc­tors, health­care, en­ergy, and be­yond, with tech­nol­ogy at the core”.</p>
    <p>“While they may be in­ter­re­lated, our re­la­tion­ship with Tai­wan is not a sub­set of our bi­lat­eral re­la­tion­ship with the PRC,” he said, re­fer­ring to main­land China.</p>
    <p>Mon­day’s an­nounce­ments come sev­eral months af­ter Tai­wan Semi­con­duc­tor Man­u­fac­tur­ing, the world’s big­gest con­tract chip­maker, an­nounced plans to build a US$12 bil­lion (S$16 bil­lion) fac­tory in Ari­zona as the Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion stepped up ef­forts to cut back sup­ply chains’ de­pen­dency on China.</p>
