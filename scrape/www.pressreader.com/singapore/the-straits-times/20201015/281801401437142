    <p>The In­done­sian Par­lia­ment handed over to Pres­i­dent Joko Wi­dodo yes­ter­day the final draft of a new labour Bill that has trig­gered days of vi­o­lent street protests and van­dal­ism through­out the world’s third largest democ­racy.</p>
    <p>Mr Joko may sign the rat­i­fied Bill, which sim­pli­fies the coun­try’s com­plex le­gal sys­tem to en­cour­age in­vest­ments, to make it im­me­di­ately ef­fec­tive. If he does not sign it, the Bill will au­to­mat­i­cally be­come ef­fec­tive 30 days af­ter it was passed by Par­lia­ment on Oct 5. The gov­ern­ment-ini­ti­ated “om­nibus Bill” was first sub­mit­ted to Par­lia­ment in Fe­bru­ary for de­lib­er­a­tion.</p>
    <p>While the gov­ern­ment said the law would boost for­eign in­vest­ment and re­vive an econ­omy bat­tered by the coro­n­avirus, union lead­ers have slammed it as ex­ploita­tive of work­ers and harm­ful to the en­vi­ron­ment.</p>
    <p>Tens of thou­sands of work­ers from the tex­tile, en­ergy and auto</p>
    <p>mo­tive in­dus­tries, among oth­ers, poured onto the streets to de­mand that Mr Joko, of­ten called Jokowi, block the Bill. He did not budge.</p>
    <p>At least a dozen cities – from Medan in Su­ma­tra in the west to Makas­sar in Su­lawesi in the east – saw days of protests marked by van­dal­ism which the lead­ers of ma­jor labour unions said were not com­mit­ted by work­ers but other groups. They have called off large crowds con­gre­gat­ing in Jakarta this week in favour of protests staged in their re­spec­tive towns.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to In­done­sian law, the pres­i­dent may is­sue an emer­gency</p>
    <p>de­cree called a perppu (gov­ern­ment reg­u­la­tion in lieu of law) to can­cel any law. This has been ex­er­cised from time to time in an emer­gency sit­u­a­tion.</p>
    <p>In 2016, Mr Joko is­sued a perppu to in­tro­duce tougher penal­ties for child sex of­fend­ers, in­clud­ing the death penalty and chem­i­cal cas­tra­tion. Former pres­i­dent Me­gawati Soekarnop­u­tri is­sued a perppu to ac­cel­er­ate the in­ves­ti­ga­tion and pros­e­cu­tion of those re­spon­si­ble for the 2002 Bali bomb­ing that killed more than 200.</p>
    <p>Sev­eral unions are pur­su­ing an al­ter­na­tive le­gal av­enue, fil­ing a peti</p>
    <p>tion at the Con­sti­tu­tional Court to chal­lenge the new labour law.</p>
    <p>Vig­i­lante group Islamic De­fend­ers’ Front took to the streets on Tues­day in protest. It was joined by the 212 Rally Alumni, which was be­hind a rally in 2016 to pros­e­cute Jakarta gover­nor Ba­suki Tja­haja Pur­nama for al­leged blas­phemy.</p>
    <p>Ms Elly Rosita and Mr Said Iqbal, lead­ers of ma­jor unions KSBSI and KSPI, said on Tues­day that they were not car­ry­ing out large-scale protests in Jakarta to pre­vent the van­dal­ism by “other el­e­ments”.</p>
