    <p>The Robin­sons depart­ment store in Raf­fles City will stay open through­out the Christ­mas and New Year pe­riod next year. It has yet to of­fi­cially an­nounce its last day.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, it is giv­ing big­ger dis­counts this week for items in the cos­met­ics, toi­letries, toys and elec­tri­cal goods sec­tions.</p>
    <p>Robin­sons’ liq­uida­tors Kor­daMen­tha said yes­ter­day: “We are not in a po­si­tion to con­firm the last day of op­er­a­tion yet as we do not want to prej­u­dice the out­come of the sales cam­paign and, there­fore, cred­i­tors’ re­cov­er­ies.”</p>
    <p>The Straits Times, how­ever, un­der­stands that trad­ing was ex­tended af­ter ne­go­ti­a­tions between the liq­uida­tors, land­lords and other stake­hold­ers.</p>
    <p>“Through these ne­go­ti­a­tions, we have suc­cess­fully agreed (on) terms that al­low for an ex­ten­sion to trad­ing on favourable terms which will pro­duce a more favourable re­sult for un­se­cured cred­i­tors,” said a Kor­daMen­tha spokesman.</p>
    <p>Also, no com­mem­o­ra­tive events will be held to mark the Yule­tide sea­son, the spokesman added.</p>
    <p>On Oct 30, Robin­sons had an­nounced the clo­sure of its last two out­lets in Sin­ga­pore, say­ing the de­ci­sion to liq­ui­date was prompted by a range of fac­tors, in­clud­ing chang­ing con­sumer tastes and cost pres­sures like rent.</p>
    <p>Its flag­ship store at The Heeren in Or­chard Road shut its doors last Wed­nes­day.</p>
    <p>Kor­daMen­tha would have com­pleted the re­al­i­sa­tion of Robin­sons’ as­sets when the Raf­fles City store is closed.</p>
    <p>Its last open­ing day will also be the last day of work for the store’s sales staff.</p>
    <p>A few back-of­fice em­ploy­ees will be kept for a short pe­riod to at­tend to post-clos­ing tasks.</p>
    <p>“Our fo­cus will turn to dis­tribut­ing the re­cov­er­ies achieved to the un­se­cured cred­i­tors. We re­main hope­ful that we will be in a po­si­tion to make this dis­tri­bu­tion by June 2021,” said Kor­daMen­tha.</p>
