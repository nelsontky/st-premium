    <p>• Doses of the vaccine made by US phar­ma­ceu­ti­cal gi­ant Pfizer and a small Ger­man com­pany BioNTech, the first rig­or­ously tested coro­n­avirus vaccine given the green light for use, are be­ing pack­aged in Bel­gium for ship­ment to Bri­tain this week.</p>
    <p>Pfizer plans to ship an ini­tial 800,000 doses to Bri­tain in the com­ing days from its pro­duc­tion plant in Pu­urs, Bel­gium, so that they will be ready to be ad­min­is­tered from Mon­day.</p>
    <p>Bri­tain on Wed­nes­day gave emer­gency use au­tho­ri­sa­tion to the Covid-19 vaccine, be­com­ing the first West­ern coun­try to pave the way for mass in­oc­u­la­tions against a dis­ease that has killed more than 1.4 mil­lion peo­ple world­wide.</p>
    <p>Within weeks, more gov­ern­ment ap­provals for the Pfizer-BioNTech and ri­val Moderna vac­cines are ex­pected as vaccine mak­ers get ready</p>
    <p>to start ship­ping mil­lions of doses.</p>
    <p>BioNTech said the first doses were be­ing pre­pared for ship­ment from Tues­day night. Boxes of sev­eral thou­sand doses each are pack­aged with dry ice to keep them at the South Pole-like tem­per­a­tures they re­quire, be­fore they are put on trucks or planes and taken to Bri­tain.</p>
    <p>Bri­tish hos­pi­tals have al­ready be­gun e-mail­ing staff to sched­ule vac­ci­na­tions, with a Lon­don hospi­tal sys­tem in­di­cat­ing that its first doses will be given at 7am on Mon­day.</p>
    <p>Bri­tain placed ad­vance or­ders for 40 mil­lion doses of the Pfizer vaccine, but most of th­ese are ex­pected to be ad­min­is­tered next year. Each pa­tient needs two doses, spaced three weeks apart.</p>
    <p>The much-awaited vaccine comes as Eng­land emerged from a month-long na­tional lock­down on Wed­nes­day, re­placed by a three­tiered sys­tem of re­stric­tions, with about 40 per cent of peo­ple sub­jected to the tough­est tier three.</p>
    <p>Un­der the new sys­tem, shops will be al­lowed to re­open across Eng­land, giv­ing a Christ­mas bo­nanza to the strug­gling re­tail sec­tor, but all bars and restau­rants in tier three ar­eas will re­main closed.</p>
    <p>On Wed­nes­day, the coun­try recorded 16,170 new coro­n­avirus cases for a to­tal of 1,659,256. Covid-19 re­lated deaths rose by 648 to 59,699, gov­ern­ment data showed.</p>
    <p>Ex­pec­ta­tions are grow­ing that more vaccine ap­provals will be granted within weeks.</p>
    <p>The Euro­pean Medicines Agency said it is ex­pected to make a de­ci­sion on Pfizer-BioNTech’s vaccine “by Dec 29 at the lat­est”, while a rul­ing on Moderna’s ver­sion should fol­low by Jan 12. The Euro­pean Com­mis­sion in Brus­sels needs to give its fi­nal ap­proval.</p>
    <p>Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna have re­quested emer­gency use au­tho­ri­sa­tion for their vac­cines from the United States Food and Drug Ad­min­is­tra­tion (FDA).</p>
    <p>The FDA car­ries out its own anal­y­sis of the vaccine and calls on an in­de­pen­dent ad­vi­sory com­mit­tee.</p>
    <p>The ad­vi­sory com­mit­tee is sched­uled for a Dec 10 meet­ing on the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, and for Moderna on Dec 17. FDA de­ci­sions on the two drugs should fol­low those meet­ings.</p>
    <p>If the agency ap­proves them, the vac­cines could be avail­able in the US this month.</p>
    <p>In Sin­ga­pore, the Health Sci­ences Au­thor­ity has started eval­u­at­ing the avail­able data sub­mit­ted by Moderna, which is seek­ing ap­proval for use of its vaccine in the Repub­lic.</p>
    <p>Aus­tralia’s phar­ma­ceu­ti­cal reg­u­la­tor said yes­ter­day it is on course to re­view the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine by next month, with the coun­try stick­ing to a March timetable to start vac­ci­na­tions.</p>
    <p>Rus­sia has al­ready be­gun test­ing its Sput­nik V vaccine on a large num­ber of vol­un­teers, and Pres­i­dent Vladimir Putin has told the au­thor­i­ties to be­gin l arge-scale vac­ci­na­tions among at-risk pop­u­la­tions from next week.</p>
    <p>BioNTech said the first doses were be­ing pre­pared for ship­ment from Tues­day night. Boxes of sev­eral thou­sand doses each are pack­aged with dry ice to keep them at the South Pole-like tem­per­a­tures they re­quire, be­fore they are put on trucks or planes and taken to Bri­tain.</p>
    <p>• Wealthy na­tions have al­ready bought up at least 80 per cent of t he f uture sup­ply of Covid-19 vac­cines, said a Philip­pine of­fi­cial.</p>
    <p>Covid-19 pol­icy chief i mple­menter Car­l­ito Galvez Jr, who is also the des­ig­nated vaccine czar, said on Wed­nes­day that de­vel­op­ing coun­tries such as the Philip­pines are now scram­bling for the re­main­ing sup­ply of the vac­cines.</p>
    <p>“Eighty per cent of the global mar­ket has been taken by the rich coun­tries. Now we are fight­ing for the 18 per cent be­cause Covax has got­ten the other (2) per cent,” Mr Galvez said dur­ing the Kapi­han sa Manila Bay fo­rum.</p>
    <p>He was re­fer­ring to the Covax Fa­cil­ity, a global mech­a­nism de­signed to guar­an­tee rapid, fair and eq­ui­table ac­cess to Covid-19 vac­cines world­wide, which the Philip­pines joined in July.</p>
    <p>The former mil­i­tary gen­eral ex­plained that the deals were made pos­si­ble by ad­vance mar­ket com­mit­ments with phar­ma­ceu­ti­cal com­pa­nies.</p>
    <p>“If we will not do the ad­vance mar­ket com­mit­ment, we will be at the tail end of the sup­ply chain,” he said dur­ing the on­line fo­rum.</p>
    <p>The Philip­pine gov­ern­ment and pri­vate com­pa­nies last week signed a sup­ply agree­ment with Bri­tish drug­maker As­traZeneca in­volv­ing at least two mil­lion doses of its vaccine.</p>
    <p>This came af­ter Pres­i­dent Ro­drigo Duterte fi­nally agreed to make ad­vance com­mit­ments and ad­vance pay­ments to pri­vate vaccine de­vel­op­ers to en­sure sup­ply for the Philip­pines, de­spite ex­press­ing reser­va­tions in Septem­ber ow­ing to the coun­try’s pro­cure­ment laws.</p>
    <p>Mr Galvez also said the gov­ern­ment is in ne­go­ti­a­tions with other big phar­ma­ceu­ti­cal com­pa­nies for po­ten­tial vaccine deals.</p>
    <p>Aside from As­traZeneca, the gov­ern­ment is look­ing into the vac­cines de­vel­oped by China’s Si­no­vac Biotech, Rus­sia’s Ga­ma­leya Re­search In­sti­tute and Pfizer of the United States.</p>
