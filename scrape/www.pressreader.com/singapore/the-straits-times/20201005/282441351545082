    <p>The beau­ti­ful cheongsams of Miss S – a new HBO Asia orig­i­nal se­ries set in 1930s Shang­hai about a so­cialite who runs a de­tec­tive agency – were so ap­peal­ing to the lead star, Chi­nese ac­tress Ma Yili, that she took three sets home for her­self.</p>
    <p>The se­ries, a Chi­nese adap­ta­tion of the Aus­tralian se­ries Miss Fisher’s Mur­der Mys­ter­ies (2012 to 2015), has over 100 cos­tumes just for Ma. The 30-parter pre­mieres to­day ex­clu­sively on HBO Go.</p>
    <p>“I love all the cos­tumes. They are so beau­ti­ful. I was given the chance to pick some pieces for my­self and I kept three cheongsams – a red sleeve­less one, a green one with trans­par­ent lace in the back and a black lace one,” Ma, 44, who plays the tit­u­lar Miss S, said in a video call with the Sin­ga­pore press.</p>
    <p>“To be hon­est, I re­gret not keep­ing more pieces.”</p>
    <p>And while cheongsams are body­hug­ging out­fits, the mother of two daugh­ters said she is lucky to be blessed with a svelte fig­ure to do them justice. She is 1.64m tall.</p>
    <p>“I’m some­one who metabolise­s pretty quickly and I hap­pened to be at my slimmest dur­ing the film­ing of this se­ries. I was only about 42kg then,” added Ma, who has acted in drama se­ries such as My Fair Princess III (2003).</p>
    <p>The 1930s Shang­hai set­ting of the show ap­pealed to her too as she is a na­tive of the city and gets to flaunt her Shang­hainese in the show.</p>
    <p>“I’ve al­ways been quite taken with the 1930s. I have yet to see a Shang­hai woman of that era por­trayed in the im­age I have in my heart. It was a won­der­ful op­por­tu­nity to be able to play this role,” she said.</p>
    <p>In the se­ries, Ma’s char­ac­ter – Miss S, also known as Su Wenli – is a wealthy and sin­gle heiress who be­comes a pri­vate de­tec­tive. She is up against a po­lice in­spec­tor, played by Vengo Gao, who is re­luc­tant to let a civil­ian med­dle in po­lice work.</p>
    <p>Ma said of her char­ac­ter: “She’s great at wheedling and be­ing sweet to peo­ple to get what she wants. She knows when to soften and apol­o­gise, she knows ex­actly what to do in dif­fer­ent sit­u­a­tions.</p>
    <p>“I’m not as slick in so­cial in­ter­ac­tions and I’m not as fear­less as her ei­ther.”</p>
    <p>In fact, Ma felt her char­ac­ter was al­most too per­fect to be true.</p>
    <p>“In my mind, she’s sort of an ide­al­is­tic hero­ine. There were more com­bat scenes planned for me ini­tially, but I told the pro­duc­tion team I don’t want her to be able to do so many things. Let the in­spec­tor (Gao) pro­tect her a bit.”</p>
    <p>The strap­ping Gao (Eter­nal Love Of Dream, 2020) looks the part of a suave in­spec­tor but Ma, who di­vorced her hus­band Chi­nese ac­tor Wen Zhang last year, said he was “shy and ner­vous” at first.</p>
    <p>She said: “He warmed up quickly though. There was a scene where my char­ac­ter sprains her leg and he car­ries her and we flirt. We adlibbed that scene and didn’t even re­hearse it, we just bounced lines off each other. That was when I felt he had truly set­tled into the role and our scenes went smoothly.”</p>
    <p>She loved the show, but her act­ing was deemed over-the-top by some view­ers when the se­ries aired in China ear­lier this year.</p>
    <p>Ma was un­fazed. “I meant for the per­for­mance to be over-the-top and a bit dra­matic be­cause to me, she’s an al­most fan­tas­ti­cal, very ide­alised char­ac­ter. The drama is very stylised too and I matched my per­for­mance to that stylis­tic man­ner.”</p>
    <p>Miss S pre­mieres to­day ex­clu­sively on HBO Go with two episodes air­ing ev­ery week­day.</p>
