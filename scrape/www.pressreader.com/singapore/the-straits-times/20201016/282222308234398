    <p>Huawei is los­ing market share in Europe. I think its brand has been dam­aged. Their hand­set sales con­tinue to do well, but in in­fra­struc­ture they are be­ing squeezed out of the de­vel­oped world.</p>
    <p>BRUSSELS • Huawei Tech­nolo­gies, al­ready get­ting squeezed out of Europe’s vast market for the next gen­er­a­tion of tele­com equip­ment, is un­der siege in another fast-grow­ing busi­ness: cloud com­put­ing.</p>
    <p>United States of­fi­cials have been lob­by­ing Euro­pean law­mak­ers and in­dus­try lead­ers to use West­ern com­pa­nies – while shun­ning Huawei – to build data cen­tres and of­fer in­fra­struc­ture to han­dle the grow­ing tide of in­for­ma­tion.</p>
    <p>As part of a Euro­pean tour last week, US Un­der-sec­re­tary of State for Eco­nomic Growth, En­ergy, and the En­vi­ron­ment Keith Krach met ex­ec­u­tives in­clud­ing Deutsche Telekom chief ex­ec­u­tive Ti­motheus Hoettges and head of Span­ish tele­com car­rier MasMovil Mein­rad Spenger to urge them to ditch Chi­nese ven­dors of cloud in­fra­struc­ture on data se­cu­rity con­cerns.</p>
    <p>“Look at this as an ex­ten­sion of that 5G,” Mr Krach said. “Clouds are re­ally im­por­tant, whether it’s in the ser­vice cloud or in data cen­tres them­selves. This is a big deal.”</p>
    <p>Pres­sure from Wash­ing­ton af­fects one of Huawei’s fastest-grow­ing busi­nesses. China’s largest tech­nol­ogy cor­po­ra­tion by sales has in past years ac­cu­mu­lated an im­pres­sive ros­ter of clients, i nclud­ing Deutsche Telekom, France’s Orange SA and Spain’s Tele­fon­ica. It is now seek­ing to ex­pand its reach to cus­tomers such as oil com­pa­nies, power grid op­er­a­tors and lo­gis­tics providers.</p>
    <p>While Alibaba Group Hold­ing op­er­ates a larger cloud busi­ness and</p>
    <p>WeChat op­er­a­tor Ten­cent Hold­ings is not far be­hind, Huawei is more vul­ner­a­ble given that the Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion has man­aged to con­vince some gov­ern­ments in the re­gion to ex­clude its 5G net­work­ing gear.</p>
    <p>Europe’s cloud in­fra­struc­ture is a US$12.4 bil­lion (S$16.9 bil­lion) busi­ness that grew 33 per cent this year from last year, ac­cord­ing to market re­searcher IDC. US play­ers dom­i­nate, led by Ama­zon.com’s AWS and fol­lowed by Mi­crosoft, IBM, Google and Or­a­cle.</p>
    <p>“Chi­nese play­ers like Alibaba and Ten­cent are not mak­ing huge in­roads into the Euro­pean market,” ac­cord­ing to IDC an­a­lyst Carla Arend.</p>
    <p>A spokesman for Huawei de­clined to com­ment on its Euro­pean cloud busi­ness.</p>
    <p>Sim­i­lar to Euro­pean tele­com firms slowly turn­ing away from Huawei for their 5G in­fra­struc­ture, US pres­sure is al­ready work­ing in the cloud. Orange CEO Stephane Richard told an­a­lysts in July that the com­pany’s cloud built on a Huawei in­fra­struc­ture was “likely no longer rel­e­vant”.</p>
    <p>“Clearly to­day, the Huawei Cloud in­fra­struc­ture is not nec­es­sar­ily the one we’re go­ing to be pro­mot­ing in Europe,” he said. Orange’s Huaweibuil­t cloud is cur­rently used by the Euro­pean Space Agency and car­marker PSA. Just days be­fore Mr Richard’s call with an­a­lysts, Orange signed a cloud deal with Google.</p>
    <p>Deutsche Telekom de­clined to com­ment on its CEO’s meet­ing with Mr Krach and its cloud busi­ness plans. The com­pany, whose big­gest sales come from its T-Mo­bile unit in the US, has cloud part­ner­ships with Cisco, Mi­crosoft, OVH and Ama­zon’s AWS. It also has an of­fer based on Huawei in­fra­struc­ture called Open Telekom Cloud for small and medium-sized com­pa­nies.</p>
    <p>While Huawei is strug­gling, US com­pa­nies are thriv­ing. Nokia Oyj on Wed­nes­day signed a five-year deal to move its IT in­fra­struc­ture onto Al­pha­bet’s Google Cloud. The US provider also re­cently won a multi-year deal to store Re­nault’s man­u­fac­tur­ing data, mark­ing the US tech com­pany’s first ma­jor in­dus­trial cloud deal in France.</p>
    <p>“Huawei is los­ing market share in Europe,” said Dr Jim Lewis, direc­tor of the Tech­nol­ogy Pol­icy Pro­gramme at the Cen­tre for Strate­gic and In­ter­na­tional Stud­ies in Wash­ing­ton. “I think its brand has been dam­aged. Their hand­set sales con­tinue to do well, but in in­fra­struc­ture they are be­ing squeezed out of the de­vel­oped world.”</p>
    <p>US sanc­tions have al­ready jeop­ar­dised Huawei’s sup­ply chain. A US ban on chip sales to Huawei kicked in on Sept 15, dis­rupt­ing its wire­less, hand­set and cloud of­fer­ings. In 5G, Bri­tain has im­posed a full ban, while France has de­vised rules mak­ing it riskier for op­er­a­tors to use Huawei equip­ment, with­out ban­ning it out­right.</p>
    <p>Tele­fon­ica, which re­tracted plans to use mainly Huawei for its 5G, sells a cloud of­fer with the com­pany in Spain, Brazil, Ar­gentina and Chile.</p>
    <p>It also has part­ner­ships with Google, SAP and Mi­crosoft. Mr Krach cited Tele­fon­ica as one of the 50 tele­com op­er­a­tors com­mit­ted to the US’ “clean net­work” plan.</p>
