    <p>China’s For­eign Min­istry spokesman Zhao Li­jian yes­ter­day ac­cused Hu­man Rights Watch of “stir­ring up trou­ble”, say­ing that the re­port was “not worth re­fut­ing”.</p>
    <p>•</p>
    <p>Mus­lims in China’s Xin­jiang were “ar­bi­trar­ily” se­lected for ar­rest by a com­puter pro­gram that flagged sus­pi­cious be­hav­iour, ac­tivists said yes­ter­day in a re­port de­tail­ing big data’s role in re­pres­sion in the restive re­gion.</p>
    <p>The United States-based non­govern­men­tal or­gan­i­sa­tion (NGO) Hu­man Rights Watch said leaked po­lice data that listed more than 2,000 de­tainees from the Aksu pre­fec­ture was fur­ther ev­i­dence of “how China’s bru­tal re­pres­sion of Xin­jiang’s Tur­kic Mus­lims is be­ing tur­bocharged by tech­nol­ogy”.</p>
    <p>Bei­jing has come un­der in­tense in­ter­na­tional crit­i­cism over its poli­cies in the re­source-rich ter­ri­tory, where rights groups say as many as one mil­lion Uighurs and other mostly Mus­lim mi­nori­ties have been held in in­tern­ment camps.</p>
    <p>China de­fends the fa­cil­i­ties as vo­ca­tional train­ing cen­tres aimed at stamp­ing out ter­ror­ism and im­prov­ing em­ploy­ment.</p>
    <p>Sur­veil­lance spend­ing in Xin­jiang has grown in re­cent years, with fa­cial recog­ni­tion, iris scan­ners, DNA col­lec­tion and ar­ti­fi­cial in­tel­li­gence de­ployed in the name of pre­vent­ing ter­ror­ism.</p>
    <p>Hu­man Rights Watch said it had ob­tained the list from an anony­mous source that had pre­vi­ously pro­vided au­dio-vis­ual con­tent taken from in­side a fa­cil­ity in Aksu.</p>
    <p>Peo­ple were flagged us­ing a pro­gram called In­te­grated Joint Op­er­a­tions Plat­form, which col­lected data from sur­veil­lance sys­tems in Xin­jiang, be­fore of­fi­cials de­cided whether to send them to camps, the NGO added.</p>
    <p>The group said its re­search sug­gests that the “vast ma­jor­ity” of peo­ple were flagged to au­thor­i­ties for le­gal be­hav­iour, in­clud­ing phone calls to rel­a­tives abroad, hav­ing no fixed ad­dress and switch­ing off their phone re­peat­edly.</p>
    <p>Only around 10 per cent of the peo­ple on the list were de­tained for ter­ror­ism or ex­trem­ism.</p>
    <p>The list, parts of which were shown to Agence France-Presse, de­scribed the rea­son for de­ten­tion of many of the peo­ple as sim­ply be­ing “flagged” by the in­te­grated plat­form. The rights group has not pub­lished the full con­tents of the list, cit­ing safety con­cerns for the per­son who had leaked it.</p>
    <p>China’s For­eign Min­istry spokesman Zhao Li­jian yes­ter­day ac­cused Hu­man Rights Watch of “stir­ring up trou­ble”, say­ing that the re­port was “not worth re­fut­ing”. The lo­cal Aksu gov­ern­ment and Xin­jiang’s re­gional au­thor­i­ties did not im­me­di­ately re­spond to Agence France-Presse’s re­quests for com­ment.</p>
    <p>Sep­a­rately, US-based sur­veil­lance re­search firm IPVM said Chi­nese tech gi­ant Huawei had been in­volved in test­ing fa­cial recog­ni­tion soft­ware that could send alerts to po­lice when it recog­nised Uighur mi­nori­ties’ faces.</p>
    <p>Huawei yes­ter­day said the pro­gram “has not seen real-world ap­pli­ca­tion”, and that the firm “only sup­plies gen­eral-pur­pose prod­ucts for this kind of test­ing”.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, US Repub­li­can Senator Marco Ru­bio and Demo­cratic Rep­re­sen­ta­tive Jim McGovern on Tues­day sent let­ters to In­tel and Nvidia seek­ing in­for­ma­tion on the sale of com­puter chips al­legedly used by China to con­duct mass sur­veil­lance on Uighurs in Xin­jiang.</p>
    <p>The let­ters asked if the firms’ chief ex­ec­u­tives knew their tech­nol­ogy would be used to sup­port such ac­tiv­i­ties and whether they took steps to en­sure their prod­ucts were not used for hu­man rights abuses or to com­pro­mise US na­tional se­cu­rity. Nvidia de­clined to com­ment. In­tel said it does not tol­er­ate its prod­ucts be­ing used to vi­o­late hu­man rights.</p>
