    <p>For The Straits Times</p>
    <p>Aus­tralia’s Prime Min­is­ter Scott Mor­ri­son is not a long-term thinker. He likes to deal with to­day’s prob­lems to­day, and leave the fu­ture to look af­ter it­self.</p>
    <p>So, when Bei­jing started to threaten Aus­tralia’s trade links with China ear­lier this year, he did not worry much.</p>
    <p>He re­fused to back down from any of the poli­cies and pro­nounce­ments that had pro­voked Bei­jing’s anger, while re­as­sur­ing Aus­tralians that all would be well. All they needed to do, he sug­gested, was wait pa­tiently and China would soon cool down and back off.</p>
    <p>This worked well for him po­lit­i­cally, earn­ing praise at home and abroad for stand­ing up to Bei­jing’s bul­ly­ing. It also con­sol­i­dated his sup­port among right-wing mem­bers of his party who are keen to be seen as tough on China. At the same time, Aus­tralian busi­nesses were happy to be told there would be no se­ri­ous or last­ing dam­age to their prospects in the world’s big­gest and most dy­namic ex­port mar­ket.</p>
    <p>That mar­ket re­ally mat­ters to Aus­tralia. China is by far its big­gest ex­port cus­tomer, tak­ing well over one-third of all its ex­ports. Even more im­por­tant, China of­fers by far the best op­por­tu­ni­ties to grow new mar­kets, es­pe­cially as it is re­bound­ing faster than any other ma­jor econ­omy from the global slow­down sparked by the coro­n­avirus pan­demic. With­out ac­cess to those op­por­tu­ni­ties, Aus­tralia’s own abil­ity to re­cover will be gravely im­per­illed.</p>
    <p>CHI­NESE GRIEV­ANCES</p>
    <p>But now that ac­cess is very se­ri­ously en­dan­gered. China has not backed off from its threats. On the con­trary, over the past six months, it has steadily es­ca­lated its rhetoric. This reached a new peak last week, when Bei­jing dis­trib­uted a 14-point list of Aus­tralian ac­tions it found ob­jec­tion­able. These ranged from bar­ring Huawei from Aus­tralia’s 5G net­work to hos­tile me­dia re­ports on China.</p>
    <p>A For­eign Min­istry spokesman in Bei­jing de­nounced Aus­tralia’s “re­peated wrong acts and re­marks on is­sues con­cern­ing China’s core in­ter­ests and ma­jor con­cerns as well as its provoca­tive and con­fronta­tional ac­tions”.</p>
    <p>All this tough talk has been ac­com­pa­nied by some se­ri­ous ac­tion. Ma­jor ship­ments to China – in­clud­ing wine, wool, bar­ley, seafood and cop­per – have been dis­rupted in re­cent weeks, clearly en­gi­neered by Bei­jing to pun­ish and warn Aus­tralia. The fear is that this pres­sure will con­tinue to es­ca­late, do­ing real dam­age to Aus­tralia’s frag­ile econ­omy. China has plenty of scope to in­crease the pres­sure, be­cause there are few things it im­ports from Aus­tralia that it could not eas­ily buy else­where. The ex­cep­tion is iron ore, of which Aus­tralia is China’s largest sup­plier, but even there China has scope to look else­where in the longer term.</p>
    <p>The gov­ern­ment in Can­berra now seems to un­der­stand that it has a se­ri­ous prob­lem, and has been pri­vately urg­ing ex­porters to look for new mar­kets. The prob­lem is that there are no new mar­kets as big and as fast-grow­ing as China. So, while Mr Mor­ri­son con­tin­ues to earn praise for stand­ing up to Bei­jing, he is also un­der in­creas­ing pres­sure to try to fix what is rapidly be­com­ing both Aus­tralia’s most se­ri­ous diplo­matic cri­sis and its most dire eco­nomic calamity in many decades.</p>
    <p>Se­nior busi­ness lead­ers have be­gun to ques­tion the gov­ern­ment’s han­dling of this vi­tal re­la­tion­ship, and even the revered for­mer prime min­is­ter John Howard, widely seen as Mr Mor­ri­son’s po­lit­i­cal men­tor, has pub­licly re­minded him that a good work­ing re­la­tion­ship with China is es­sen­tial for Aus­tralia.</p>
    <p>While Aus­tralians con­tinue to ap­prove of the way Mr Mor­ri­son stands up to Bei­jing’s bul­ly­ing, more and more of them are be­gin­ning to ask how and why the gov­ern­ment in Can­berra al­lowed things to get this bad in the first place.</p>
    <p>It is a fair ques­tion. Al­though some of Bei­jing’s griev­ances are petty, there is no doubt that Can­berra has be­come no­tably hos­tile to China in re­cent years, and has taken steps clearly aimed at lim­it­ing Chi­nese in­volve­ment and en­gage­ment in Aus­tralia’s econ­omy and so­ci­ety.</p>
    <p>These in­clude fre­quent re­jec­tions of Chi­nese in­vest­ment pro­pos­als, sharp lim­its on aca­demic ex­changes, ac­cu­sa­tions of Chi­nese in­ter­fer­ence in Aus­tralian do­mes­tic pol­i­tics, and new mech­a­nisms to al­low Can­berra to veto agree­ments made be­tween Chi­nese en­ti­ties and Aus­tralia’s state and lo­cal gov­ern­ments and uni­ver­si­ties. Many of these mea­sures have been en­shrined in a flurry of new leg­is­la­tion giv­ing the fed­eral gov­ern­ment un­prece­dented pow­ers, and quite un­am­bigu­ously di­rected at China.</p>
    <p>Can­berra has claimed that these mea­sures are nec­es­sary to pro­tect Aus­tralia’s na­tional se­cu­rity and sovereignt­y in the face of China’s grow­ing power and its de­ter­mi­na­tion ex­pand its in­flu­ence, es­pe­cially in East Asia and the Western Pa­cific. It would be naive to imag­ine that there are not gen­uine grounds for con­cern here. Like ev­ery coun­try in Asia, Aus­tralia faces new and un­fa­mil­iar chal­lenges as it tries to work out how to man­age re­la­tions with this am­bi­tious ris­ing power.</p>
    <p>But does this jus­tify the bar­rage of new poli­cies and laws which Can­berra has bran­dished at China in re­cent years? By in­vok­ing the vague but po­tent idea of “na­tional se­cu­rity” the gov­ern­ment has avoided much scrutiny of the mea­sures it has taken, but there is no sign the costs and risks in­volved have been care­fully weighed.</p>
    <p>On the one hand, no hard ev­i­dence has been pro­duced of any se­ri­ous at­tempts at po­lit­i­cal in­ter­fer­ence by Bei­jing, for ex­am­ple. On the other hand, no one in Can­berra seems to have asked how Bei­jing would be likely to re­spond, and what the costs and con­se­quences would be. As a re­sult, Aus­tralia is pay­ing heav­ily for ill-con­sid­ered re­sponses to vague and ex­ag­ger­ated threats.</p>
    <p>So what can Can­berra do now? Mr Mor­ri­son says Aus­tralia can do noth­ing, be­cause the things</p>
    <p>Bei­jing ob­jects to are just</p>
    <p>“Aus­tralia be­ing Aus­tralia”.</p>
    <p>“Our democ­racy is not up for trade and our sovereignt­y is not up for trade,” he said in re­sponse to Chi­nese crit­i­cisms last week. The im­pli­ca­tion is clear. He will change noth­ing, and just keep hop­ing China will change its mind.</p>
    <p>His op­ti­mism seems to be based pri­mar­ily on his faith that other coun­tries will sup­port Aus­tralia in stand­ing up to China.</p>
    <p>He has been heart­ened by mes­sages of sol­i­dar­ity from se­nior fig­ures in Washington, and by the ex­pec­ta­tion that ris­ing sus­pi­cions to­wards China in Bri­tain and Europe will see the same from them.</p>
    <p>But he pins most faith on the sup­port of Aus­tralia’s neigh­bours. He and his sup­port­ers see them­selves as tak­ing a stand against Chi­nese bul­ly­ing on be­half of the rest of Asia. On this reck­on­ing, the blows that Aus­tralia is suf­fer­ing at Bei­jing’s hands are hon­ourable wounds in a heroic strug­gle in which it will be loy­ally sup­ported by other Asian na­tions.</p>
    <p>THE JA­PANESE AP­PROACH</p>
    <p>It was there­fore no­table that last week, as the harsh words es­ca­lated be­tween Bei­jing and Can­berra, Mr Mor­ri­son took the ex­tra­or­di­nary step of vis­it­ing Tokyo in per­son – his first over­seas trip since the pan­demic be­gan – to talk to</p>
    <p>Ja­pan’s new Prime Min­is­ter Yoshi­hide Suga. The “in prin­ci­ple” agree­ment on the use of one an­other’s mil­i­tary bases which they signed is be­ing talked up by Can­berra as a full-scale de­fence pact, and thus as ev­i­dence of Ja­pan’s ro­bust sup­port for Aus­tralia’s de­fi­ance of Bei­jing.</p>
    <p>But the truth is that Ja­pan is tak­ing a very dif­fer­ent ap­proach from Aus­tralia’s. This week, China’s For­eign Min­is­ter Wang Yi is in Tokyo to dis­cuss, among other things, the reschedul­ing of a visit by Pres­i­dent Xi Jin­ping, which had been de­ferred by the pan­demic. That is the kind of high-level con­tact which has now be­come un­think­able be­tween Bei­jing and Can­berra. De­spite the deep dif­fer­ences and very real dis­putes be­tween Ja­pan and China,</p>
    <p>Tokyo has worked hard in re­cent years to keep re­la­tions har­mo­nious with­out sac­ri­fic­ing key Ja­panese in­ter­ests.</p>
    <p>And that is what other coun­tries through­out Asia have been do­ing, too. They are tak­ing pru­dent steps qui­etly to pro­tect their most im­por­tant in­ter­ests, with­out de­lib­er­ately and un­nec­es­sar­ily pro­vok­ing China, be­cause they know there is no al­ter­na­tive but to pre­serve good re­la­tions with a coun­try which, like it or not, will be vi­tal to their fu­ture pros­per­ity.</p>
    <p>Aus­tralians are start­ing to won­der why their lead­ers can­not fol­low this ex­am­ple. And that means Mr Mor­ri­son is go­ing to have to start think­ing more care­fully about where the de­ci­sions he takes to­day are go­ing to lead in the fu­ture.</p>
