    <p>Liver­pool’s new mid­field sign­ing Thi­ago Al­can­tara has tested pos­i­tive for Covid-19 and is self-iso­lat­ing with mi­nor symp­toms, the Pre­mier League cham­pi­ons said on Tues­day.</p>
    <p>The Spa­niard joined last month from Euro­pean cham­pi­ons Bay­ern Mu­nich for £22 mil­lion (S$35.2 mil­lion) and made his de­but in their 2-0 league win over Chelsea on Sept 20.</p>
    <p>The 29-year-old was ruled out of their next two games af­ter miss­ing Mon­day’s 3-1 vic­tory over Arse­nal at An­field.</p>
    <p>“It is the choice of each in­di­vid­ual whether they re­veal pub­licly the out­come of a Covid-19 test,” Liver­pool’s first-team doc­tor Ji m</p>
    <p>Moxon said in a state­ment.</p>
    <p>“We have fol­lowed all the pro­to­cols to the let­ter and Thi­ago is OK. He will be self-iso­lat­ing now as per the guide­lines and hope­fully he’ll be back with us soon.”</p>
    <p>Liver­pool will host Arse­nal in the last 16 of the League Cup to­day and re­turn to league ac­tion on Sun­day with a trip to As­ton Villa.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, the Pre­mier League will pay for manda­tory coro­n­avirus tests for play­ers of English Foot­ball League clubs that are in­volved in matches against top-flight teams in Cup com­pe­ti­tions this sea­son, The Times of Lon­don has re­ported.</p>
    <p>The de­ci­sion comes amid grow­ing con­cern about safety af­ter many clubs in the lower tiers of</p>
    <p>English foot­ball said they would not be able to cover the costs of tests.</p>
    <p>Tot­ten­ham paid for the Covid-19 test­ing of Ley­ton Ori­ent’s play­ers and staff ahead of their League Cup third-round tie, which pro­duced a sig­nif­i­cant num­ber of positives. The game was called off and Spurs were later handed a bye.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing the meet­ing of Pre­mier League share­hold­ers, it was also agreed that should the sea­son be halted due to the pan­demic, the standings would be de­cided on a points-per-game ba­sis, the Times re­ported.</p>
