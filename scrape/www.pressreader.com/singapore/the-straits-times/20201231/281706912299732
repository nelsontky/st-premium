    <p>The coro­n­avirus and ef­forts to stem its spread took a mas­sive toll on the econ­omy this year, with a sharp rise in work­ers los­ing their jobs or tak­ing a steep pay cut.</p>
    <p>But the dark­est of times also brought out the best in Sin­ga­pore­ans, many of whom stepped for­ward to give money or their time to help.</p>
    <p>The need was great, with more ask­ing the Govern­ment for fi­nan­cial aid.</p>
    <p>About 40,000 peo­ple ap­plied for ComCare’s short- to medium-term and long-term as­sis­tance schemes be­tween June and Novem­ber, rep­re­sent­ing a 25 per cent in­crease over the 32,000 ap­pli­ca­tions made in the same pe­riod last year, a Min­istry of So­cial and Fam­ily De­vel­op­ment (MSF) spokesman told The Straits Times.</p>
    <p>She said: “The num­ber of ComCare cases might have increased due to the eco­nomic im­pact of the Covid-19 pan­demic.”</p>
    <p>Recog­nis­ing the scope of the need, the MSF also au­to­mat­i­cally ex­tended ComCare sup­port to those whose aid was to end be­tween May and Oc­to­ber, which gave fam­i­lies a longer pe­riod of help to find some sta­bil­ity.</p>
    <p>The Com­mu­nity Care En­dow­ment Fund (ComCare Fund) is a key so­cial safety net for lower-in­come fam­i­lies.</p>
    <p>Over 20,000 work­ers were re­trenched in the first three quar­ters of the year, com­pared with slightly over 8,000 peo­ple who were axed in the same pe­riod last year, ac­cord­ing to Min­istry of Man­power (MOM) data.</p>
    <p>About 250,000 em­ploy­ees also had their pay cut be­tween March and Septem­ber this year.</p>
    <p>A study by char­ity Be­yond So­cial Ser­vices of over 1,000 fam­i­lies who ap­plied for its fi­nan­cial as­sis­tance fund this year found that many bread­win­ners faced a loss of their jobs or a sig­nif­i­cant pro­por­tion of their in­come.</p>
    <p>Many were work­ers in jobs such as clean­ing, food and bev­er­age, and re­tail, or were driv­ers.</p>
    <p>But even as their in­comes fell, their rents and mort­gages re­mained the same, caus­ing many fam­i­lies to fall into ar­rears, said Be­yond’s deputy ex­ec­u­tive di­rec­tor Ran­ganayaki Thangavelu.</p>
    <p>Adam (not his real name), 54, used to hold two jobs to make ends meet, work­ing as a cleaner earn­ing about $1,600 a month, and as an oc­ca­sional handy­man, which added to his in­come.</p>
    <p>His wife is a house­wife and the fam­ily of six live in a one-room rental flat. They have four chil­dren, aged be­tween seven and 15.</p>
    <p>When the cir­cuit breaker was im­posed, the boss of his clean­ing firm asked him to look for other work, and Adam turned to the Govern­ment for help.</p>
    <p>His fam­ily be­gan re­ceiv­ing $2,040 a month, from Au­gust till next month, from ComCare. This is among other aid the fam­ily has re­ceived from the MSF.</p>
    <p>Adam, who is still work­ing as an ad-hoc handy­man, said: “With ComCare help, at least we can sur­vive. Now, find­ing a new job is also dif­fi­cult.”</p>
    <p>While the pan­demic has seen more fam­i­lies like his plunge into fi­nan­cial hard­ship, more Sin­ga­pore­ans have also stepped up to lend a help­ing hand.</p>
    <p>A re­port by the Min­istry of Fi­nance’s Sin­ga­pore Public Sec­tor Out­comes Re­view stated that calls for vol­un­teers and do­na­tions met with an over­whelm­ing re­sponse dur­ing the pan­demic, with peo­ple pitch­ing in for na­tional ef­forts and also start­ing their own ini­tia­tives.</p>
    <p>For ex­am­ple, more than 13,000 Sin­ga­pore­ans signed up as vol­un­teers through the SGUnited por­tal for peo­ple who wanted to con­trib­ute dur­ing the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>In Oc­to­ber, Deputy Prime Min­is­ter Heng Swee Keat said that do­na­tions to Covid-19-re­lated causes through the Com­mu­nity Chest, the Sayang Sayang Fund and Giv­ing.sg reached about $100 mil­lion from Jan­uary to Au­gust.</p>
    <p>This amount ex­ceeded the do­na­tions re­ceived by the Com­mu­nity Chest and Giv­ing.sg for the whole of last year.</p>
    <p>In April, the Te­masek Trust gave $10 mil­lion to l aunch the os­car@sg fund to sup­port groundup ini­tia­tives re­spond­ing to needs aris­ing from the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>It has ap­proved projects by 158 grantees so far. About 60 per cent of the grantees are in­di­vid­u­als, while the rest are non-profit groups.</p>
    <p>Ms Cheo Hock Kuan, its chief ex­ec­u­tive, said: “We see ex­am­ples of (grantees) de­liv­er­ing meals to mi­grant work­ers, send­ing ra­dio sets to se­nior cit­i­zens to com­bat lone­li­ness... We are heart­ened by the own­er­ship un­der­taken by the com­mu­ni­ties to look after each other in this sea­son.”</p>
    <p>One group that re­ceived fund­ing, Pro­ject Smile Masks, was started by stay-at-home mum Ros­alind Tong, 45, who, with a friend, de­cided to sew masks for front­line work­ers and the el­derly. Soon, more peo­ple joined their pro­ject.</p>
    <p>After get­ting re­quests, they now also sew what they call “smile masks”, which have a plas­tic seethrough por­tion i n the mouth area, to make it eas­ier for peo­ple who are deaf to lip-read the per­son wear­ing the mask.</p>
    <p>The group now has more than 150 vol­un­teers and it has given out over 3,500 “smile masks” to peo­ple who need them, such as those from the Sin­ga­pore As­so­ci­a­tion for the Deaf.</p>
    <p>Ac­coun­tant Michelle Sim, 47, and coun­sel­lor Evonne Wee, 44, are vol­un­teers with the ini­tia­tive.</p>
    <p>Both of them like to sew and they wanted to do some­thing for the com­mu­nity dur­ing the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Ms Wee, who has two chil­dren, said: “I can con­trib­ute my sewing skills to peo­ple in need. I feel re­ally good do­ing it.”</p>
    <p>HEART­EN­ING SIGHT</p>
    <p>We see ex­am­ples of (grantees) de­liv­er­ing meals to mi­grant work­ers, send­ing ra­dio sets to se­nior cit­i­zens to com­bat lone­li­ness... We are heart­ened by the own­er­ship un­der­taken by the com­mu­ni­ties to look after each other in this sea­son.</p>
    <p>MS CHEO HOCK KUAN, chief ex­ec­u­tive of the Te­masek Trust, which gave $10 mil­lion to launch the os­car@sg fund to sup­port ground-up ini­tia­tives re­spond­ing to needs aris­ing from the pan­demic.</p>
