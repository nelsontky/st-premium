    <p>LON­DON • Bri­tain is draw­ing up plans to turn Lon­don into a ri­val of Sin­ga­pore as a hub for ship­ping com­pa­nies to reg­is­ter ves­sels af­ter the Brexit tran­si­tion pe­riod, ac­cord­ing to sources.</p>
    <p>In­dus­try bod­ies and unions have been can­vassed over the re­form of the ship­ping in­dus­try’s so-called ton­nage tax af­ter Jan 1 next year, when Bri­tain is no longer sub­ject to the Euro­pean Union’s state aid regime on sub­si­dies.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to cal­cu­la­tions pro­vided to the gov­ern­ment, re­vamp­ing Bri­tain’s ship­ping tax and reg­u­la­tion regime could be worth £3.7 bil­lion (S$6.6 bil­lion) to the economy over three years and cre­ate 2,500 high-qual­ity jobs di­rectly, as well as 25,000 in re­lated firms.</p>
    <p>Plans due to be sub­mit­ted to min­is­ters at the De­part­ment for Trans­port last week in­cluded ex­pand­ing the scope of the Bri­tish scheme by count­ing oil rigs as “ships” for tax pur­poses – which is not al­lowed un­der EU rules con­trol­ling the sub­sidy of mar­itime trans­port – in or­der to at­tract more busi­ness.</p>
    <p>A £30 mil­lion gov­ern­ment­funded scheme to train cadets di­rectly on be­half of ship­ping com­pa­nies has also been mooted.</p>
    <p>A spokesman for the De­part­ment for Trans­port said: “We do not com­ment on leaks.”</p>
    <p>Since the Brexit vote, the ton­nage of ships reg­is­tered un­der the Bri­tish flag has de­clined by a third, ac­cord­ing to a re­port pre­pared for the gov­ern­ment, be­cause of un­cer­tainty about leav­ing the bloc.</p>
    <p>The pro­pos­als ar­gue that this could partly be ad­dressed with a “hearts and minds” cam­paign to per­suade ship­ping firms to reg­is­ter their ves­sels un­der the Bri­tish flag.</p>
    <p>Among the plans be­ing dis­cussed is en­abling float­ing pro­duc­tion stor­age and of­fload­ing ves­sels and drilling rigs to be in­cluded in the Bri­tish ton­nage tax regime in or­der to give Bri­tain a com­pet­i­tive ad­van­tage over cur­rent EU reg­u­la­tions.</p>
    <p>Mr David Blu­men­thal, a tax part­ner with Clyde & Co who han­dles ton­nage tax is­sues, said Bri­tain’s de­par­ture from the EU was an op­por­tu­nity.</p>
    <p>“The idea is that if we’re not con­strained by EU state aid, we could have more abil­ity to do things that would make the UK more at­trac­tive to ship­ping com­pa­nies,” he said.</p>
    <p>In the EU, ton­nage tax regimes are signed off by the bloc’s state aid author­i­ties. The rules of­fer ship­ping com­pa­nies a route to avoid cor­po­ra­tion tax in ex­change for reg­is­ter­ing and man­ag­ing their ves­sels in an EU coun­try.</p>
    <p>An­other sug­ges­tion is that com­pa­nies that choose to flag their ves­sels in Bri­tain could face a “lighter touch” test for how much of their ship­ping is man­aged in Bri­tain – a cru­cial re­quire­ment un­der EU ton­nage tax regimes.</p>
    <p>The pro­posal seen by the Fi­nan­cial Times re­peat­edly ref­er­ences Sin­ga­pore as a bench­mark for Bri­tain’s post-Brexit as­pi­ra­tions.</p>
    <p>The Bri­tish ton­nage tax scheme</p>
    <p>also in­cludes a re­quire­ment for com­pa­nies to train cadets, which the new pro­pos­als sug­gested could be taken on by the gov­ern­ment – a form of sub­sidy.</p>
    <p>Re­search for the gov­ern­ment has shown this train­ing re­quire­ment makes the Bri­tish ton­nage tax up to 14 times more ex­pen­sive than in Sin­ga­pore and be­tween eight and 10 times the cost in per­mis­sive EU ju­ris­dic­tions such as Malta and Cyprus.</p>
    <p>The ship­ping and wider mar­itime in­dus­try em­ploys more than 200,000 peo­ple and con­trib­utes over £46 bil­lion a year to the Bri­tish economy, ac­cord­ing to the UK Cham­ber of Ship­ping.</p>
    <p>The cham­ber con­firmed it was work­ing with the gov­ern­ment to ex­plore op­tions to en­hance Bri­tain as an in­ter­na­tional ship­ping hub.</p>
