    <p>Be­laru­sian Pres­i­dent Alexan­der Lukashenko has so far failed to put down protests against his 26-year rule, more than two weeks af­ter an elec­tion many say was rigged. Re­gard­less of how the cur­rent cri­sis is re­solved, Be­larus will re­main a key strate­gic prob­lem for both Rus­sia and the West.</p>
    <p>Af­ter fac­ing al­most three weeks of mas­sive public protests in the wake of an elec­tion whose re­sults are widely per­ceived to have been rigged, Be­laru­sian Pres­i­dent Alexan­der Lukashenko re­mains de­ter­mined to hold on to power.</p>
    <p>Op­po­si­tion leaders are be­ing rounded up, the armed forces are putting up a show of force on the streets and Mr Lukashenko is in­creas­ingly be­ing shown on state-con­trolled TV in a mil­i­tary uni­form, of­ten clutch­ing a ma­chine gun. The mes­sage is un­mis­tak­able: The Be­laru­sian Pres­i­dent is staying.</p>
    <p>But in many re­spects, the for­mer So­viet repub­lic of nine mil­lion peo­ple, ruled with an iron fist by Mr Lukashenko for over half a cen­tury, can­not go back to its old sleepy ways. Re­gard­less of how the cur­rent cri­sis is re­solved, Be­larus will re­main a key strate­gic prob­lem for both Rus­sia and the West.</p>
    <p>The 65-year-old leader’s main achieve­ment is to trans­form his coun­try into a time bub­ble, a liv­ing mu­seum to the old So­viet Union. Most of Be­larus’ econ­omy is state-owned and ut­terly de­pen­dent on neigh­bour­ing Rus­sia.</p>
    <p>The old So­viet sym­bols are ev­ery­where and the se­cu­rity ser­vice is still called the KGB, just as the So­viet Union’s feared ser­vice was; even Rus­sia’s spooks con­sid­ered it ap­pro­pri­ate to re­brand them­selves.</p>
    <p>Mr Lukashenko is also in­creas­ingly er­ratic. He re­fuses to use mo­bile phones and other gad­gets as he claims a head of state should be “tra­di­tional”, al­though his se­cu­rity ser­vices have full ac­cess to tech­nol­ogy. He also dis­missed the coronaviru­s pan­demic as a hoax and re­fused to adopt pre­ven­tive health mea­sures.</p>
    <p>Yet, for the first time since he came to power in 1994, he is fac­ing a real threat to his regime from Ms</p>
    <p>Svet­lana Tikhanovsk­aya, 37, the wife of a lead­ing op­po­si­tion leader cur­rently un­der ar­rest.</p>
    <p>She has suc­ceeded in ar­tic­u­lat­ing the frus­tra­tions of a new gen­er­a­tion of Be­laru­sians, many of whom have known noth­ing but Mr Lukashenko’s rule.</p>
    <p>It is dif­fi­cult to know how well Ms Tikhanovsk­aya scored in the Aug 9 pres­i­den­tial elec­tion; both can­di­dates claim de­ci­sive vic­to­ries.</p>
    <p>What is no longer dis­puted, how­ever, is that there was wide­spread elec­toral rig­ging; even the gov­ern­ment has stopped pre­tend­ing that the of­fi­cial re­sults are cred­i­ble. Still, Mr Lukashenko hopes to re­tain power by sim­ply wear­ing the op­po­si­tion out. He has sug­gested pos­si­ble con­sti­tu­tional changes which will re­duce the pres­i­dent’s pow­ers but, apart from that, has of­fered no con­ces­sions.</p>
    <p>The snag is that op­po­si­tion pres­sure will not go away. Ms Tikhanovsk­aya has sought refuge in neigh­bour­ing Lithua­nia, from where she con­tin­ues to claim that she is the right­ful leader of Be­larus.</p>
    <p>More im­por­tantly, the strikes against the gov­ern­ment are con­tin­u­ing. At the week­end, hun­dreds of thou­sands paral­ysed the streets of the cap­i­tal Minsk and many pro­vin­cial cities. “Be­larus has wo­ken up. We are not the op­po­si­tion any more. We are the ma­jor­ity now,” said Ms Tikhanovsk­aya in a speech to the Euro­pean Par­lia­ment yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>What hap­pens next largely de­pends not on what is hap­pen­ing in Euro­pean Union capitals, but on Rus­sian leader Vladimir Putin.</p>
    <p>Mr Putin has never hid­den his im­pa­tience with Mr Lukashenko; the two clearly do not get on. But Be­larus is very im­por­tant to Rus­sia: Its ge­o­graphic po­si­tion al­lows Rus­sian armed forces to be de­ployed deep in­side Europe, and the coun­try is also a key tran­sit point for Rus­sian oil and gas sup­plies to im­por­tant Western mar­kets.</p>
    <p>Fur­ther­more, Be­larus is one of the few for­mer So­viet states to wel­come close links with Rus­sia.</p>
    <p>Yet, Rus­sia is also anx­ious to avoid hav­ing to use force to prop up the Lukashenko gov­ern­ment, partly be­cause this would repli­cate the show­down between Rus­sia and the West over Ukraine, but also be­cause Mr Putin fears hav­ing to bail out a failed Be­laru­sian state.</p>
    <p>EU gov­ern­ments are also in a bind. They have de­cided not to recog­nise the re­sults of the Be­laru­sian elec­tion, in ef­fect ask­ing Mr Lukashenko to ac­cept a new bal­lot and a pos­si­ble trans­fer of power – an un­likely sce­nario.</p>
    <p>They can only wait and see, and hope that Rus­sia’s pa­tience will snap and Moscow will agree to a change of gov­ern­ment in Be­larus.</p>
    <p>It is a high-stakes game, which one way or an­other is likely to be de­cided in the next few weeks.</p>
