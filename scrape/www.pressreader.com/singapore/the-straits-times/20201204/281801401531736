    <p>Cold stor­age in In­dia is largely geared to­wards veg­eta­bles and fruit and even that is seen to be in­ad­e­quate, re­sult­ing in wastage of some 40 per cent. Ac­cord­ing to a Yes Bank study, 83 per cent of the cold stor­age in In­dia is used for hor­ti­cul­tural and agri­cul­tural prod­ucts and only 1 per cent for phar­ma­ceu­ti­cals. There are is­sues rang­ing from poor in­fra­struc­ture to trans­port and elec­tric­ity sup­ply in re­mote ar­eas.</p>
    <p>In Mum­bai, In­dia’s fi­nan­cial cap­i­tal, the au­thor­i­ties have de­cided to convert an en­tire floor in a five-storey build­ing into a cold stor­age fa­cil­ity for vac­cines.</p>
    <p>The ex­ist­ing cold stor­age fa­cil­ity at four med­i­cal col­leges in the city has also been ear­marked for coro­n­avirus vaccine stor­age, with city au­thor­i­ties iden­ti­fy­ing 125,000 health­care and front-line work­ers as the first re­cip­i­ents.</p>
    <p>The up­com­ing cold stor­age fa­cil­ity will be able to store 500,000 vials, which will dou­ble Mum­bai’s cur­rent ca­pac­ity.</p>
    <p>The gov­ern­ment of Ma­ha­rash­tra state, of which Mum­bai is the cap­i­tal, has de­cided against us­ing non-med­i­cal cold stor­age.</p>
    <p>“It’s an is­sue of sen­si­tiv­ity (and) we don’t want to use any other stor­age (like for veg­eta­bles) and com­pro­mise. We have de­cided to cre­ate an al­to­gether new fa­cil­ity. We are plan­ning to fin­ish by end-De­cem­ber. If we get some vac­cines by the end of the month, there won’t be an is­sue for vac­ci­na­tion,” said Mr Suresh</p>
    <p>Kakani, ad­di­tional mu­nic­i­pal com­mis­sioner at the Bri­han­mum­bai Mu­nic­i­pal Cor­po­ra­tion, the area’s lo­cal ad­min­is­tra­tion.</p>
    <p>The mu­nic­i­pal cor­po­ra­tion has even chalked out routes to trans­port the vaccine.</p>
    <p>“We have pre­pared the en­tire blueprint,” he said, not­ing that it was in touch with man­u­fac­tur­ers to fi­nalise the plans and tem­per­a­ture con­trol re­quire­ments.</p>
    <p>In­dia, the world’s sec­ond-most pop­u­lous coun­try with a pop­u­la­tion of 1.35 bil­lion, is also the sec­ond-most af­fected by the coro­n­avirus, with more than</p>
    <p>9.5 mil­lion cases.</p>
    <p>Since the pan­demic started, the coun­try has bol­stered ca­pa­bil­i­ties in other ar­eas, in­creas­ing med­i­cal fa­cil­i­ties, ramp­ing up test­ing to one mil­lion tests daily and boost­ing the man­u­fac­ture of pro­tec­tive gear and masks.</p>
    <p>Stor­ing and dis­tribut­ing the vac­cines is seen as the next big chal­lenge. In­dia has around 28,000 cold store units, de­signed for vac­cines stored at tem­per­a­tures of 2 deg C to 8 deg C.</p>
    <p>Cold stor­age in In­dia is largely geared to­wards veg­eta­bles and fruit and even that is seen to be in­ad­e­quate, re­sult­ing in wastage of some 40 per cent. Ac­cord­ing to a Yes Bank study, 83 per cent of the cold stor­age in In­dia is used for hor­ti­cul­tural and agri­cul­tural prod­ucts and only 1 per cent for phar­ma­ceu­ti­cals. There are is­sues rang­ing from poor in­fra­struc­ture to trans­port and elec­tric­ity sup­ply in re­mote ar­eas.</p>
    <p>The gov­ern­ment is acutely aware of this par­tic­u­lar chal­lenge, with Prime Min­is­ter Naren­dra Modi last week ask­ing all the states to start work­ing on bol­ster­ing cold stor­age fa­cil­i­ties.</p>
    <p>An ef­fort is also be­ing made to boost the Uni­ver­sal Im­mu­ni­sa­tion Pro­gramme, which deals with an av­er­age of 27 mil­lion in­fants and 30 mil­lion preg­nant women ev­ery year.</p>
    <p>But not ev­ery­one is con­vinced the coun­try will be able to quickly ramp up its ca­pac­i­ties.</p>
    <p>“To ex­pand (the cold chain fa­cil­ity) to im­mu­nise ev­ery­one is a chal­lenge. We sim­ply do not have the ca­pac­ity. We can get the re­quired ca­pac­ity, but for that we have to strengthen all of the health sys­tems, and not only the cold chain. It’s about fi­nan­cial re­sources and hu­man re­sources and in­fra­struc­ture,” said pub­lic health ex­pert, Dr T. Sun­darara­man. “So on a sys­tem which is al­ready in­ad­e­quate... to add on the Covid-19 tar­get, which at its low­est is 30 per cent of the pop­u­la­tion, would be huge.”</p>
    <p>Se­nior sci­en­tist Satya­jit Rath, a vis­it­ing fac­ulty mem­ber at the In­dian In­sti­tute of Sci­ence, Ed­u­ca­tion and Re­search, noted that the scale of im­mu­ni­sa­tion re­quired had never been seen in In­dia be­fore “even if one takes into ac­count the re­cently re­ported gov­ern­ment stance that ev­ery­one is not go­ing to be vac­ci­nated”.</p>
    <p>“The vac­ci­na­tion cam­paign will, by cur­rent ex­pec­ta­tions, run into In­dia’s sum­mer, caus­ing fur­ther wor­ries about the re­li­a­bil­ity of power sup­ply for th­ese stor­age units. How this ca­pac­ity is to be ramped up and made ro­bust is not yet clear,” he said.</p>
    <p>There are five vac­cines be­ing tested and cre­ated in In­dia – from As­traZeneca-Ox­ford, Zy­dus Cadila, Bi­o­log­i­cal E, Dr Reddy’s and Bharat Biotech. The Pfizer vaccine, the first to be ap­proved in Bri­tain, is not seen as a se­ri­ous con­tender as it has to be stored at mi­nus 70 deg C.</p>
    <p>Still, epi­demi­ol­o­gist Shahid Jameel re­mains op­ti­mistic that the coun­try would be able to bol­ster cold stor­age fa­cil­i­ties.</p>
    <p>“In­dia is not look­ing se­ri­ously at vac­cines that re­quire ul­tra low tem­per­a­ture stor­age con­di­tions, be­cause be­sides this prob­lem those vac­cines are also very ex­pen­sive and im­me­di­ate stocks are al­ready pre-booked by wealthy na­tions. For­tu­nately, In­dia is in a good po­si­tion with hu­man clin­i­cal tri­als for five dif­fer­ent vac­cines, some at late stages,” he said.</p>
    <p>“Th­ese would also re­quire more man­age­able re­frig­er­a­tor tem­per­a­tures with long-term frozen stor­age. For that we have ca­pac­ity due to the large po­lio vaccine pro­gramme. More ca­pac­ity is be­ing added.”</p>
