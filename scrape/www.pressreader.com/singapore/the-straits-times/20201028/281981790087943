    <p>New ground was bro­ken this week when par­tic­i­pants at the Sin­ga­pore In­ter­na­tional En­ergy Week – the first to host up to 250 per­sons on site since pan­demic re­stric­tions be­gan – un­der­went pre-event swab tests for Covid-19. The anti­gen rapid tests, al­though less sen­si­tive than poly­merase chain re­ac­tion ones, can yield faster re­sults within 30 min­utes. A suc­cess­ful pi­lot could pave the way for looser lim­its on group sizes for gath­er­ings, which are now capped at five. Largescale events such as wed­ding re­cep­tions, live per­for­mances, sports and busi­ness con­fer­ences might then re­sume even­tu­ally. This comes as agen­cies here work out ways to in­cor­po­rate fast test­ing and wide­spread trac­ing into Sin­ga­pore’s</p>
    <p>Covid-19 re­sponse ahead of a Phase 3 of reopen­ing. Anti­gen rapid tests are be­ing used in for­eign worker dor­mi­to­ries as part of their ex­ist­ing ros­tered rou­tine test­ing, to quickly de­tect and iso­late asymp­to­matic Covid-19 cases. In­creas­ing the test­ing fre­quency will help pick out pos­i­tive cases that might have oth­er­wise slipped through.</p>
    <p>As Phase 3 re­quires three-quar­ters of the pop­u­la­tion to par­tic­i­pate in dig­i­tal con­tact trac­ing, the sup­ply and dis­tri­bu­tion of TraceTo­gether to­kens have also been ramped up. More than 400,000 TraceTo­gether to­kens have been col­lected to date, putting Sin­ga­pore at the 50 per cent mark for par­tic­i­pa­tion rate. Those who want a to­ken will be able to get one by end-De­cem­ber if they do not wish to down­load the app.</p>
    <p>A cal­i­brated reopen­ing is the way for­ward to avoid more dras­tic re­stric­tions later. A sec­ond wave of Covid-19 is now wash­ing over Euro­pean coun­tries such as Spain, France, Bel­gium and the Nether­lands. The govern­ments – leery of a pub­lic back­lash – chose not to im­ple­ment strict so­cial dis­tanc­ing mea­sures when in­fec­tion num­bers came down over the sum­mer. Many of them also failed to build ro­bust test-trace-iso­late sys­tems and are now fall­ing back on blunt mea­sures that are eco­nom­i­cally dev­as­tat­ing, such as cur­fews, quar­an­tines, and shut­ting down schools, cin­e­mas and restau­rants for weeks.</p>
    <p>This does not mean that Sin­ga­pore, by con­trast, is com­pletely out of the woods. Rather, most ac­tiv­i­ties – in­clud­ing travel to coun­tries where the Covid-19 sit­u­a­tion is sim­i­lar to or bet­ter than Sin­ga­pore’s – could be al­lowed to go on with ad­e­quate safe man­age­ment mea­sures in place, such as mask-wear­ing, safe dis­tanc­ing, and group-size and ca­pac­ity lim­its. There will have to be con­tin­ued ef­fec­tive trac­ing and test­ing. Many will nat­u­rally chafe at the on­go­ing re­stric­tions and want larger fam­ily gath­er­ings to be al­lowed. But the more Sin­ga­pore­ans ex­er­cise so­cial re­spon­si­bil­ity, the greater the like­li­hood that the coun­try will be able to move ahead with open­ing up, mit­i­gat­ing the im­pact on busi­nesses, while also min­imis­ing the health risks from in­fec­tion trans­mis­sion.</p>
