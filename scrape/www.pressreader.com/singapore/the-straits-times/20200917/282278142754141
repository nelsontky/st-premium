    <p>• Aus­tralia’s es­ca­lat­ing ten­sions with Bei­jing have shown up its re­liance on China trade and pro­pelled a push to in­crease links with Asia’s other gi­ant econ­omy, In­dia.</p>
    <p>New en­rol­ments of in­ter­na­tional stu­dents from In­dia ex­panded 32 per cent last year from 2018 and it is the fastest-grow­ing ma­jor mar­ket for Aus­tralian ser­vices. In­dia has over­taken China as the largest source of net mi­gra­tion to Aus­tralia, and its di­as­pora is the third largest Down Un­der, just be­hind China and Bri­tain.</p>
    <p>In­dia’s swelling pop­u­la­tion – set to over­take China’s by 2027 – sug­gests on­go­ing op­por­tu­ni­ties for Aus­tralia to di­ver­sify a trade port­fo­lio that cur­rently makes it the de­vel­oped world’s most China-de­pen­dent econ­omy.</p>
    <p>The need to switch things up has ac­cel­er­ated as ties sank to their low­est ebb in 30 years after Can­berra’s calls for an in­ter­na­tional in­quiry into Covid-19’s ori­gins was taken by Bei­jing as a po­lit­i­cal at­tack, with China im­pos­ing bar­ri­ers on Aus­tralian bar­ley, beef and wine.</p>
    <p>This has Aus­tralia look­ing to In­dia to fill the void. Prime Min­is­ter Scott Mor­ri­son held a vir­tual sum­mit with his In­dian coun­ter­part in June and they signed a de­fence agree­ment and up­graded ties to a Com­pre­hen­sive Strate­gic Part­ner­ship. Trade min­is­ters of Ja­pan, In­dia and Aus­tralia re­cently agreed to work towards achiev­ing sup­ply chain re­silience in the Indo-Pa­cific.</p>
    <p>“We can sell In­dia ed­u­ca­tion, health­care, and there’s po­ten­tial in science and tech­nol­ogy,” said Dr Ian Hall, a pro­fes­sor of in­ter­na­tional re­la­tions at Griffith Univer­sity in Queens­land. “It’s much more the con­sumer mar­ket of In­dia’s grow­ing mid­dle class than goods.”</p>
    <p>Yet trade with In­dia has its own chal­lenges. Its gov­ern­ment is wed­ded to eco­nomic na­tion­al­ism, as show­cased last year when it pulled out of the Re­gional Com­pre­hen­sive Eco­nomic Part­ner­ship de­signed to free up trade. Delhi wants to send lots of peo­ple to Aus­tralia on work visas and does not want to re­duce tar­iffs, ac­cord­ing to for­mer Aus­tralian trade min­is­ter Craig Emer­son, who ini­ti­ated the Aus­tralia-In­dia free trade ne­go­ti­a­tions in 2011, re­sult­ing in a two-way trade around just one-tenth of China-Aus­tralia ship­ments.</p>
    <p>“In­dia is highly con­cerned about its trade deficit,” said po­lit­i­cal sci­en­tist Chan Lai-Ha of the Univer­sity of Tech­nol­ogy in Sydney, who notes that after sign­ing free trade agree­ments with South Korea and Ja­pan, In­dia’s trade deficit with those na­tions bal­looned. “It would be very wor­ried about Aus­tralian farm prod­ucts, like dairy, harm­ing In­dian farm­ers.”</p>
    <p>Aus­tralia’s most valu­able ex­port – iron ore – has not yet been caught in China’s cross hairs. Yet Bei­jing ap­pears to be giv­ing it­self greater flex­i­bil­ity, with Mr Emer­son not­ing that China is buy­ing ore car­ri­ers that im­prove the eco­nomics of long-dis­tance ship­ping from Brazil and pur­chas­ing Guinea mines. “It’s en­tirely pos­si­ble China, once it gets all three min­eral provinces in a row – Guinea, Brazil and Aus­tralia – will play one off against the other to get a bet­ter price,” he said. “If you’re China, you’d say ‘where’s our vul­ner­a­bil­ity? Iron ore. So let’s di­ver­sify, let’s fix that’. They may never need to ac­ti­vate it, but it’s there, it’s avail­able.”</p>
    <p>Bloomberg econ­o­mists said Aus­tralia’s ser­vices ex­ports have been ex­pe­ri­enc­ing a quiet tec­tonic shift over the past 18 months. In ed­u­ca­tion, growth in In­dian en­rol­ments has seen the num­ber of In­dian stu­dent visa hold­ers eclipse Chi­nese stu­dents. While China’s dom­i­nance of Aus­tralia’s goods ex­ports re­flects commoditie­s de­mand, in the em­ploy­ment-in­ten­sive ser­vices sec­tor China’s im­por­tance has been chal­lenged by a dou­bling of ser­vices ex­ports to In­dia over the past two years.</p>
