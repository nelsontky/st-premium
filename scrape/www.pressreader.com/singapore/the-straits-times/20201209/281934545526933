    <p>Re­cent puni­tive ac­tion taken against Gemma Steak­house at the Na­tional Gallery Sin­ga­pore and Foot Locker’s Or­chard out­let for breaches of safe man­age­ment mea­sures should pro­vide am­ple warn­ing that com­pa­nies and in­di­vid­u­als should not be­have as if the dan­ger from the coro­n­avirus pan­demic has passed. If Sin­ga­pore is to move into Phase 3 of its re­open­ing safely and in a sus­tained way, ev­ery res­i­dent must play his or her part in mak­ing safety pro­to­cols work. Ig­nor­ing the rules en­dan­gers not only oth­ers but also the rule-break­ers them­selves, who could be ex­posed to health risks and con­trib­ute to de­lay­ing the re­turn to a sem­blance of eco­nomic and so­cial nor­malcy that ev­ery­one longs for.</p>
    <p>Gemma Steak­house was or­dered to sus­pend op­er­a­tions for 20 days for hav­ing held a din­ner for 75 guests and for not pre­vent­ing them from mix­ing, a fla­grant vi­o­la­tion of Covid-19 safe man­age­ment mea­sures. A pri­vate mem­bers’ club worked with the restau­rant to or­gan­ise a Hal­loween­themed din­ner. It was at­tended by club mem­bers and their guests. Shoe re­tailer Foot Locker was or­dered to sus­pend op­er­a­tions for 10 days at its Or­chard Gate­way @ Emer­ald out­let for hav­ing failed to com­ply with safe man­age­ment mea­sures. Large crowds had gath­ered at the out­let for a prod­uct launch in spite of re­peated ad­vi­sories by pub­lic en­force­ment agen­cies on crowd man­age­ment.</p>
    <p>While the loss of busi­ness should pro­vide a stern re­minder to any out­let of the penalty for hav­ing breached their so­cial re­spon­si­bil­i­ties, the men­tal­ity of the in­di­vid­u­als who were there and ig­nored safe man­age­ment mea­sures is equally, if not more, dis­ap­point­ing. The term “co­vid­iots” was coined pre­cisely to de­scribe such be­hav­iour. Their ir­re­spon­si­bil­ity cre­ated ma­te­rial prob­lems for the busi­nesses they pa­tro­n­ised. Busi­nesses owe it to them­selves to guard against such cus­tomers. While it is un­der­stand­able that busi­nesses will com­pete for cus­tomers as the econ­omy climbs out of the depths of its Covidean fall, no re­cov­ery will be sus­tain­able un­less busi­nesses play their part con­sis­tently. Safe man­age­ment mea­sures are a crit­i­cal part of that process.</p>
    <p>Com­pa­nies that ig­nore the longer-term con­se­quences of their ac­tions for short-term profit do so at their own peril. Sin­ga­pore­ans should pay heed to these is­sues be­cause of what has oc­curred glob­ally. The Euro­pean Union’s sec­ond wave is prov­ing to be more deadly than the first. South Korea has called for ex­panded coro­n­avirus test­ing and more thor­ough trac­ing as it strug­gles to con­trol its lat­est and largest wave of in­fec­tions that has dealt a blow to its lauded pan­demic-fight­ing mea­sures. Ex­ces­sive so­cial mix­ing and gath­er­ings are also blamed for a fourth wave of Covid-19 in Hong Kong. Sin­ga­pore­ans should ask them­selves if they want to go down the same path.</p>
