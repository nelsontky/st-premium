    <p>Na­tional Trades Union Congress pres­i­dent Mary Liew be­lieves that Mr Ng Chee Meng should re­tain his po­si­tion as sec­re­tary-gen­eral of NTUC, as the po­si­tion is in­de­pen­dent of po­lit­i­cal ap­point­ments (NTUC reaf­firms sup­port for Ng Chee Meng as labour chief, July 15).</p>
    <p>I be­lieve that given a choice, most work­ers would dis­agree. NTUC shares a long­stand­ing sym­bi­otic re­la­tion­ship with the rul­ing party, which was re­it­er­ated by Prime Min­is­ter Lee Hsien Loong last year (Work­ers won’t be alone as econ­omy trans­forms: PM Lee,</p>
    <p>Oct 16, 2019).</p>
    <p>Due to this re­la­tion­ship, for decades, the NTUC sec­re­tary-gen­eral has been ap­pointed to the Cab­i­net. This speaks vol­umes about the level of im­por­tance and trust the Gov­ern­ment places on the po­si­tion of labour chief.</p>
    <p>With the on­go­ing se­vere eco­nomic dis­rup­tion and huge job losses due to the Covid-19 pan­demic, NTUC needs a leader in the Cab­i­net who can push for work­ers’ wel­fare and in­ter­ests. The close re­la­tion­ship be­tween the Gov­ern­ment and NTUC must be main­tained to have a har­mo­nious labour re­la­tion­ship. It would be dif­fi­cult to con­vince work­ers that their in­ter­ests have been taken care of if their labour chief is not a Cab­i­net min­is­ter.</p>
