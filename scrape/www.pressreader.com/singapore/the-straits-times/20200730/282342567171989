    <p>A High Court hear­ing for OCBC Bank’s ap­pli­ca­tion to bring the Lim fam­ily-run Xihe Hold­ings and four of its ves­sel-own­ing units un­der ju­di­cial man­age­ment has been ad­journed to Aug 13.</p>
    <p>Fol­low­ing a hear­ing in cham­bers yes­ter­day, the Xihe Group of com­pa­nies, which owns nearly 140 ves­sels, said “it and its 12 lenders have ad­journed court pro­ceed­ings to work to­gether to­wards a con­sen­sual re­struc­tur­ing”.</p>
    <p>On July 20, cred­i­tor OCBC ap­plied to the High Court for Mr Se­shadri Ra­jagopalan and Mr Paresh Jotan­gia of Grant Thorn­ton Sin­ga­pore to be ap­pointed as in­terim ju­di­cial man­agers (IJM) for Xihe and four of its sub­sidiaries: Da Xin Tankers, Hua Guang Ship­ping, Nan King Mar­itime and Hua Xin Ship­ping.</p>
    <p>Among the rea­sons cited, OCBC said it “strongly dis­trusts (their) cur­rent man­age­ment” af­ter US$208.1 mil­lion (S$286 mil­lion) was trans­ferred by the Xihe group to trou­bled oil trader Hin Leong “for no valid com­mer­cial pur­pose”, ac­cord­ing to court doc­u­ments seen by The Straits Times.</p>
    <p>The Lim fam­ily, which owns and man­ages the Xihe group, has “ad­mit­ted to and/or been found to have fab­ri­cated fic­ti­tious gains and forged doc­u­ments on a mas­sive scale, con­cealed mas­sive losses, mis­used se­cured in­ven­tory and mis­led banks into ex­tend­ing fi­nanc­ing to Hin Leong, caus­ing (the) bil­lion-dol­lar in­sol­ven­cies of Hin Leong and Ocean Tankers”, OCBC added.</p>
    <p>Hin Leong and its ship­ping arm Ocean Tankers ini­tially sought a six-month mora­to­rium on debts of more than US$3.6 bil­lion to 23 banks. The oil trader’s founder Lim Oon Kuin ad­mit­ted he had di­rected the firm to hide about US$800 mil­lion in fu­tures trad­ing losses.</p>
    <p>OCBC noted that the Lims fur­ther paid them­selves div­i­dends of US$30 mil­lion in 2017 and US$60 mil­lion in 2018 from Hin Leong when there were no prof­its to sup­port such div­i­dends, and with­drew US$19 mil­lion from Ocean Tankers shortly be­fore fil­ing for the debt mora­to­rium.</p>
    <p>The se­ri­ous ir­reg­u­lar­i­ties ex­tend to the af­fairs of Xihe and its four units, OCBC said.</p>
    <p>It noted that “bare­boat charters of OCBC-fi­nanced ves­sels were ter­mi­nated with­out OCBC’s con­sent, and the Xihe units have per­sis­tently failed to... col­lect pay­ments from Ocean Tankers for months or years, to the prej­u­dice of cred­i­tors of the Xihe group, and in breach of con­trac­tual obli­ga­tions owed to OCBC”.</p>
    <p>“Es­pe­cially in the light of the in­ter­linked busi­nesses, com­mon own­er­ship and lead­er­ship of the debtor com­pa­nies, Hin Leong and Ocean Tankers, in­de­pen­dent ju­di­cial man­agers need to be ap­pointed ur­gently over the debtor com­pa­nies to in­ves­ti­gate the se­ri­ous ir­reg­u­lar­i­ties and pre­vent fur­ther prej­u­dice to cred­i­tors,” OCBC said.</p>
