    <p>SHANG­HAI • China’s re­la­tion­ship with the United States has reached a “new cross­roads” and could get back on the right track fol­low­ing a pe­riod of “un­prece­dented dif­fi­culty”, se­nior diplo­mat Wang Yi said in of­fi­cial com­ments pub­lished yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Re­la­tions be­tween the world’s two big­gest economies have come un­der in­creas­ing strain amid a se­ries of dis­putes over trade, hu­man rights and the ori­gins of Covid-19.</p>
    <p>In its lat­est move, the United States black­listed dozens of Chi­nese com­pa­nies it said had ties to the mil­i­tary.</p>
    <p>Mr Wang, China’s State Coun­cil­lor and For­eign Min­is­ter, said in a joint in­ter­view with Xin­hua news agency and other state me­dia out­lets that re­cent US poli­cies to­wards China had harmed the in­ter­ests of both coun­tries and brought huge dan­gers to the world.</p>
    <p>But there is now an op­por­tu­nity for the two sides to “open a new win­dow of hope” and be­gin a new round of dia­logue, he said.</p>
    <p>The elec­tion of Mr Joe Bi­den as US pres­i­dent has been widely ex­pected to im­prove re­la­tions be­tween Wash­ing­ton and Bei­jing af­ter four years of es­ca­lat­ing ten­sions un­der the ad­min­is­tra­tion of Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump.</p>
    <p>Last month, Mr Wang said he hoped the elec­tion of Mr Bi­den would al­low the US pol­icy on China to “re­turn to ob­jec­tiv­ity and ra­tio­nal­ity”.</p>
    <p>How­ever, Pres­i­dent-elect Bi­den, who will take of­fice on Jan 20, has con­tin­ued to crit­i­cise China for its “abuses” on trade and other is­sues.</p>
    <p>Mr Wang urged the United States to “re­spect the so­cial sys­tem and de­vel­op­ment path” cho­sen by China, adding that if Wash­ing­ton “learns lessons”, the con­flicts be­tween the two sides could be re­solved.</p>
    <p>“We know some peo­ple in the United States are ap­pre­hen­sive about China’s rapid de­vel­op­ment, but the most sus­tain­able lead­er­ship is to con­stantly move for­ward your­self, rather than block the de­vel­op­ment of other coun­tries,” he said.</p>
    <p>Politi­cians in the US have ac­cused China of cov­er­ing up the out­break of Covid-19 dur­ing its early stages, de­lay­ing its re­sponse and al­low­ing the dis­ease to spread much far­ther and faster.</p>
    <p>But Mr Wang said: “We raced against time, and were the ear­li­est to re­port the epi­demic to the world.</p>
    <p>“More and more stud­ies show that the epi­demic very prob­a­bly emerged in many places through­out the world.”</p>
