    <p>MAK­ING GOOD PROGRESS</p>
    <p>The tar­geted help he got in school helped him to fo­cus and par­tic­i­pate bet­ter in class... He has come a long way. It en­cour­ages us as par­ents to see Amos able to learn along­side his neu­rotyp­i­cal peers.</p>
    <p>MRS SANDRA THAM, Amos’ mother</p>
    <p>Seven-year-old Amos Tham used to plonk him­self on the floor in school when he did not want to take part in cer­tain ac­tiv­i­ties, or when he had to move from one class to the next.</p>
    <p>His teach­ers at St James’ Church Kinder­garten (SJCK) in Hard­ing Road would try to coax him to go along with the rest of his class, while un­sure what more they could do to en­cour­age him to join his peers.</p>
    <p>But af­ter work­ing to­gether with early in­ter­ven­tion­ists from Rain­bow Cen­tre, they found tar­geted ways to help Amos, who has Down syn­drome, to bet­ter han­dle tran­si­tions in the past year.</p>
    <p>Ms Tee Yi, a se­nior early in­ter­ven­tion­ist from Rain­bow Cen­tre, said the teach­ers would in­form Amos of the next ac­tiv­ity 10 to 15 min­utes be­fore­hand and re­mind him about it every few min­utes, with the help of a per­sonal sched­ule printed out for him.</p>
    <p>In­stead of try­ing to per­suade him to join every ac­tiv­ity, his teach­ers learnt to un­der­stand his cues bet­ter and present op­tions to him, she added.</p>
    <p>When he was tired, for in­stance, they would ask him if he wanted to rest his head on a ta­ble or take a break on a chair for a few min­utes.</p>
    <p>He be­came more ac­tive in class ac­tiv­i­ties, and his mother, Mrs Sandra Tham, saw im­prove­ments in his com­mu­ni­ca­tion and cog­ni­tive skills.</p>
    <p>“The tar­geted help he got in school helped him to fo­cus and par­tic­i­pate bet­ter in class,” said the 38-year-old housewife.</p>
    <p>“It could be that his oral mo­tor mus­cles are get­ting stronger as he grows up. It’s also the peer in­flu­ence at St James’, be­cause he likes to mimic his friends,” she added.</p>
    <p>“One re­cent phrase he learnt is ‘That’s cool’.”</p>
    <p>Mrs Alice Lock, prin­ci­pal of SJCK Hard­ing cam­pus, said that in coplan­ning l es­sons, her teach­ers iden­ti­fied ac­tiv­i­ties in which they strug­gled to en­gage chil­dren with spe­cial needs.</p>
    <p>Hav­ing worked with early in­ter­ven­tion­ists, the teach­ers’ mind­sets have changed, she said.</p>
    <p>“They re­alise that they just need to change a lit­tle bit of their teach­ing strate­gies or class­room man­age­ment, (and) chil­dren with ad­di­tional needs have the po­ten­tial to achieve some­thing,” said Mrs Lock.</p>
    <p>An­other par­ent, Madam Chris Goh, said the tie-up be­tween SJCK and Rain­bow Cen­tre has been timely.</p>
    <p>She had not been able to find a suitable pre-school for her fiveyear-old daugh­ter, who has sus­pected autism, but the 35-yearold, who works in the tele­mar­ket­ing sec­tor, still wanted her daugh­ter to at­tend a reg­u­lar pre-school.</p>
    <p>“The real world is not go­ing to be like in the early in­ter­ven­tion set­ting where ev­ery­thing is cus­tomised for her and where ev­ery­one is so car­ing,” said Madam Goh.“I want her to so­cialise with peers, cope with emo­tions and deal with un­pre­dictable sce­nar­ios.”</p>
    <p>Amos’ mother said she ini­tially had reser­va­tions about plac­ing him in a reg­u­lar pre-school.</p>
    <p>“He had low mus­cle tone, wasn’t speak­ing and was tube-fed up to three years old. When he joined St James’, he was still walk­ing un­steadily and not speak­ing at all. We had to tell teach­ers to use sign lan­guage,” re­called Mrs Tham, whose older son, aged nine, at­tended the same preschool and is now in Pri­mary 3 in</p>
    <p>a main­stream school.</p>
    <p>“The teach­ers were very will­ing to take up the task. They loved and ac­cepted him, and his class­mates also stepped up to the role of help­ing him,” she said.</p>
    <p>“He has come a long way. It en­cour­ages us as par­ents to see Amos able to learn along­side his neu­rotyp­i­cal peers... We hope that this can con­tinue.”</p>
