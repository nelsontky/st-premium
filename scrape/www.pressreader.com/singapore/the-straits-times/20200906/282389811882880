    <p>A cou­ple from Sin­ga­pore booked a pri­vate jet to the Mal­dives for a 10-day ro­man­tic get­away last month, af­ter the par­adise-na­tion re­opened bor­ders in mid-July.</p>
    <p>Fly­ing in style with cham­pagne and del­i­ca­cies served by an air stew­ardess garbed in per­sonal pro­tec­tive equip­ment, the duo were the only pas­sen­gers in a Gulf­stream G150 jet that can seat half a dozen.</p>
    <p>The price tag for a so­cially dis­tanced flight on a mid-sized air­craft like this? US$50,000 (S$68,000) or more, one way.</p>
    <p>The es­cape out of Sele­tar Air­port was bro­kered by Air Char­ter Ser­vice, which opened its Sin­ga­pore of­fice in March, when pas­sen­gers ev­ery­where were scram­bling to fly home be­fore swathes of the world went into lockdown.</p>
    <p>Be­tween April and last month, the com­pany clocked three times more char­ters in and out of Sin­ga­pore, com­pared with the same pe­riod last year.</p>
    <p>Mr Brendan Toomey, its chief ex­ec­u­tive here, says cus­tomised flights have height­ened ap­peal now that pri­vacy, safety and flex­i­ble de­par­tures are de­sir­able in a pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Take safety. A pri­vate air pas­sen­ger en­coun­ters only about 40 peo­ple from home to ho­tel check-in, he says. For com­mer­cial flights, the av­er­age rises to 700 en­coun­ters.</p>
    <p>In this light, char­tered flights are en­joy­ing a surge in busi­ness glob­ally as pas­sen­gers, many of them fly­ing pri­vately for the first time, make the flight to safety, said avi­a­tion com­pa­nies and re­cent re­ports.</p>
    <p>Last month, the World Eco­nomic Fo­rum, in a re­port pub­lished in part­ner­ship with non-profit news or­gan­i­sa­tion The Con­ver­sa­tion, said: “We are also wit­ness­ing a rise in the use of in­di­vid­u­als and or­gan­i­sa­tions hir­ing pri­vate jets as short-term so­lu­tions to avoid­ing air­port de­lays.”</p>
    <p>Some Bri­tish uni­ver­si­ties have also char­tered pri­vate jets for in­com­ing in­ter­na­tional stu­dents as a way to en­sure a steady flow of in­come, the re­port added.</p>
    <p>New York-based brand-build­ing con­sul­tancy firm Finn Part­ners listed five ways pri­vate jets are shap­ing avi­a­tion trends, in­clud­ing with flex­i­ble timings.</p>
    <p>“You are not re­stricted to strin­gent timings like those of com­mer­cial air­line sched­ules, you cre­ate your very own sched­ule,” read its blog post pub­lished last month.</p>
    <p>“If you’re run­ning late, the plane will wait for you, or if you want to change your de­par­ture time, this can eas­ily be done.”</p>
    <p>The Bel­la­graph Nova Group, which put in a takeover bid for New­cas­tle United foot­ball club, claimed on its In­sta­gram ac­count that it has over 10,000 pri­vate jets at its dis­posal. The post was edited later to re­move the num­ber.</p>
    <p>While pri­vate jets have an aura of ex­clu­siv­ity, the truth is that they are not only for ul­tra-high-net­worth in­di­vid­u­als like Rus­sian billionair­es and Hol­ly­wood stars.</p>
    <p>Be­sides stu­dents, avi­a­tion com­pa­nies have also repatriate­d stranded cruise ship staff to their home coun­tries, af­ter com­mer­cial flights were widely dis­rupted.</p>
    <p>From Sin­ga­pore, Air Char­ter Ser­vice, a Bri­tish com­pany with ac­cess to 50,000 jets on six con­ti­nents, has sent a marine en­gi­neer to the Philip­pines to at­tend to a cargo ship.</p>
    <p>Mr Toomey says his com­pany sup­ports clients who “need to move”, in­clud­ing ro­tat­ing crew from ships or cargo air­craft, who nor­mally rely on com­mer­cial air­lines. The com­pany has also repatriate­d fam­i­lies to Ph­nom Penh and pro­fes­sion­als to In­dia.</p>
    <p>Some ser­vices are rel­a­tively af­ford­able, es­pe­cially if clients fill ev­ery seat and choose not to have a flight at­ten­dant or catered meal on board.</p>
    <p>A shorter re­gional route, such as from Sin­ga­pore to Ph­nom Penh, starts at about US$20,000 for a su­per light air­craft, and the cost can</p>
    <p>be split among six or seven pas­sen­gers.</p>
    <p>Still, in Asia, a busi­ness jet is per­ceived as a lux­ury, com­pared with in other mar­kets.</p>
    <p>Mr Den­nis Lau, an an­a­lyst at Cir­ium, an avi­a­tion an­a­lyt­ics com­pany, says: “Most peo­ple in Asia view it as a lux­ury item, while in ma­ture mar­kets such as the United States, busi­ness jets are mostly seen as a busi­ness tool to help com­pa­nies in­crease pro­duc­tiv­ity.”</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore is one of the few ma­jor cities in Asia to have a sec­ond air­port avail­able to han­dle busi­ness flights, he notes.</p>
    <p>And a mis­per­cep­tion is that pri­vate jets can skirt bor­der con­trols.</p>
    <p>Mr Lau says: “In­ter­na­tional trav­ellers are sub­ject to the same re­stric­tions, whether they travel by busi­ness jet or com­mer­cial air­line flights.”</p>
    <p>Although pri­vate jets also face travel re­stric­tions, their ap­peal is grow­ing and avi­a­tion com­pa­nies are in­no­vat­ing the ex­pe­ri­ence for these times.</p>
    <p>Global busi­ness avi­a­tion com­pany Vis­taJet an­nounced in July that it had em­bed­ded the Tem­pus IC2 vi­tal signs mon­i­tor within its global fleet. In case of ill­ness on board, air crew can mea­sure and trans­mit the clin­i­cal data of the pa­tient in real time to ground­based med­i­cal ex­perts 24/7.</p>
    <p>Mr Thomas Flohr, Vis­taJet’s founder and chair­man, said: “It is the next best thing to hav­ing a doc­tor by your side.”</p>
    <p>Also in July, Qatar Air­ways an­nounced its Di­a­mond Agree­ment for cor­po­rate and leisure cus­tomers to pre-pur­chase flight time at fixed hourly rates on long-range and ul­tra-long-range pri­vate jets.</p>
    <p>The min­i­mum pur­chase is 50 hours – with no min­i­mum an­nual use – but the rates are not pub­licly dis­closed. These be­spoke flights are guar­an­teed if booked at least 72 hours in ad­vance.</p>
    <p>The Doha-based air­line noted that as a re­sult of the Covid-19 pan­demic, clients are look­ing for “ver­sa­tile, high-qual­ity ser­vices from a fi­nan­cially se­cure op­er­a­tor”.</p>
    <p>Look­ing ahead, the de­mand for pri­vate jets may grow as travel re­stric­tions are grad­u­ally lifted, fill­ing the gap be­fore sched­uled flights re­sume.</p>
    <p>“Those who must travel ur­gently could choose the busi­ness jet op­tion,” says Mr Lau from Cir­ium. There is also the “mor­eish” fac­tor. Trav­ellers who have used busi­ness jets for the first time could choose it again for fu­ture trav­els, “driven by the con­ve­nience, pri­vacy and peace of mind of­fered by busi­ness jets which they have ex­pe­ri­enced”, he sug­gests.</p>
    <p>And so, pri­vate jets are one bright spot, keep­ing at least one seg­ment of the bruised avi­a­tion sec­tor aloft.</p>
