    <p>The Yoshi­hide Suga gov­ern­ment’s an­nounce­ment that it is seek­ing an 8.3 per cent hike in the de­fence bud­get – the ninth in­crease in a row – should come as no sur­prise to those who fol­low Ja­panese af­fairs. Faced with the prospect of a Covid-weak­ened United States di­lut­ing its com­mit­ment to de­fend Ja­pan mil­i­tar­ily, and the steady pres­sure ap­plied by Bei­jing over the mar­itime dis­pute re­gard­ing the Senkaku/Diaoyu is­lands, and a North Korea that has not hes­i­tated to shoot rock­ets over its ter­ri­tory, Tokyo has re­acted by start­ing to build more in­de­pen­dent de­fence ca­pa­bil­i­ties. In­deed, it could be said that it has lit­tle choice, since even the US is urg­ing it to do so.</p>
    <p>Rather than a break from tra­di­tion, the new de­fence bud­get should be seen as a con­tin­uum along the path set by for­mer prime min­is­ter Shinzo Abe, whose deputy Mr Suga was – serv­ing close to eight years as chief Cabi­net sec­re­tary. Bud­gets take months of prepa­ra­tion and this one, there­fore, is as much Mr Abe’s work as it is Mr Suga’s. Like­wise, Mr Suga’s first big diplo­matic ini­tia­tive, the meet­ing of for­eign min­is­ters from the Quadri­lat­eral Di­a­logue na­tions that Tokyo is host­ing to­day, is an­other sig­nal of business-as-usual from Tokyo. The Quad, as it is called, groups Ja­pan, the US, In­dia and Aus­tralia, and is seen by Bei­jing as an irk­some de­vel­op­ment be­cause of its po­ten­tial to de­velop into a mil­i­tary al­liance.</p>
    <p>Even with the new bud­get, which is ex­pected to pass the Diet with­out prob­lems, the 5.48 tril­lion yen (S$71 bil­lion) de­mand, which amounts to a shade un­der US$52 bil­lion, is less than a third of the US$178 bil­lion (S$242 bil­lion) that Bei­jing is spend­ing this year on its mil­i­tary, it­self a 6.6 per cent in­crease from last year.</p>
    <p>A more pro­duc­tive ex­er­cise, per­haps, is to keep an eye on new ar­eas where the money will be spent. Ja­pan’s De­fence Min­istry is ask­ing for US$690 mil­lion to ex­pand the Ja­pan Self-De­fence Forces’ space unit and the Space Sit­u­a­tional Aware­ness sur­veil­lance sys­tem, and US$340 mil­lion to build its cy­berspace de­fence unit and elec­tro­mag­netic war­fare ca­pa­bil­i­ties. This re­flects its as­sess­ment of the new do­mains where fu­ture con­flicts could erupt.</p>
    <p>In 2018, Ja­pan, for the first time, par­tic­i­pated in the an­nual Schriever Wargames hosted by the US Air Force Space Com­mand. That year, the ex­er­cise de­picted a 2028 sce­nario in which a no­tional peer space and cy­berspace com­peti­tor seeks to achieve strate­gic goals by ex­ploit­ing those do­mains. New De­fence Min­is­ter Nobuo Kishi’s re­cent re­marks in­di­cate that Tokyo is plan­ning to strike at threats where they re­side. In other words, it is eye­ing in­ter­me­di­ate-range mis­siles. The two he­li­copter car­ri­ers in its ar­moury – the Izumo and the Kaga – are hav­ing their decks har­dened to be able to host some of the 100 F-35s that the US is sell­ing to Ja­pan. With this bud­get, Ja­pan is step­ping up to play a role in the re­gion.</p>
