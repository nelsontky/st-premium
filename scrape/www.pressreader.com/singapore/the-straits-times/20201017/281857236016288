    <p>•</p>
    <p>View­ers of Thurs­day’s du­elling net­work town halls with United States Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump and Demo­cratic pres­i­den­tial can­di­date Joe Bi­den were treated to a pair of tele­casts as starkly dif­fer­ent as the ri­vals they fea­tured.</p>
    <p>Mr Bi­den’s ABC town hall had all the fire­works of a vin­tage episode of This Week With David Brink­ley. Mr Trump’s NBC forum had all the sub­tlety of a pro­fes­sional wrestling match. The elec­tion may hinge on which type of pro­gram­ming Amer­i­cans want to spend the next four years watch­ing.</p>
    <p>Ms Sa­van­nah Guthrie, an an­chor on To­day, wel­comed view­ers with a friendly greet­ing – “We want to say, right off the top, this is not how things were sup­posed to go tonight” – that hinted only at the stakes for her and her net­work.</p>
    <p>But if Mr Trump ex­pected an easy night on NBC, for­mer home to his show The Ap­pren­tice, he did not an­tic­i­pate Ms Guthrie, whose back­ground as a for­mer lit­i­ga­tor quickly came in handy.</p>
    <p>In an out-of-the-gate bar­rage, Ms Guthrie pressed him re­peat­edly on his med­i­cal con­di­tion, if he had taken a Covid-19 test be­fore the first pres­i­den­tial de­bate, if he would de­nounce white supremacy and if he op­posed QAnon – ques­tions that Mr Trump, who typ­i­cally sits down with friendly in­ter­view­ers, had avoided fac­ing.</p>
    <p>The Pres­i­dent is a skilled dodger who has out­ma­noeu­vred his in­ter­locu­tors for four years. But Ms Guthrie re­peat­edly in­ter­rupted his fil­i­buster at­tempts, throw­ing Mr Trump off kil­ter.</p>
    <p>“I just don’t know about QAnon,” he protested, de­clin­ing to crit­i­cise the fringe con­spir­acy group. “You do know!” Ms Guthrie shot back.</p>
    <p>At another mo­ment, when Mr Trump bran­dished a sheaf of papers to re­but a point – “I have things right here that will show you ex­actly the op­po­site!” – Ms Guthrie re­vealed her own set of doc­u­ments. “Me, too!” she re­torted.</p>
    <p>Ms Guthrie kept up the pres­sure, ca­jol­ing him into a side­long ac­knowl­edge­ment of a New York Times re­port about his US$400 mil­lion (S$543 mil­lion) debt load, which he had pre­vi­ously re­fused to con­firm.</p>
    <p>And she con­fronted him with a con­cern that even some of his al­lies share: “You’re the Pres­i­dent,” Ms Guthrie said. “You’re not some­one’s crazy un­cle who can retweet what­ever.”</p>
    <p>On ABC, the mood was dif­fer­ent. Mr Bi­den and an­chor Ge­orge Stephanopo­u­los en­gaged in a sober pol­icy con­ver­sa­tion more suited to a Sun­day morn­ing pub­lic af­fairs broad­cast.</p>
    <p>Seated on a drab blue set, legs crossed, the men dis­cussed the pan­demic, taxes, the en­vi­ron­ment and the Supreme Court.</p>
    <p>When Mr Stephanopo­u­los fol­lowed up on the ef­fect of the coro­n­avirus on the Demo­crat’s tax plans – “Mr vice-pres­i­dent, let me press you on that” – Mr Bi­den replied: “Ab­so­lutely. That’s a great ques­tion.” He went on to cite a study from the fi­nan­cial firm Moody’s.</p>
    <p>Later, when Mr Stephanopo­u­los nudged Mr Bi­den to wrap up an an­swer, the can­di­date apol­o­gised. “Not at all,” Mr Stephanopo­u­los re­sponded po­litely.</p>
    <p>The tone tensed up when Mr Bi­den de­clined, as he has sev­eral times, to fully ex­plain his view on ex­pand­ing the Supreme Court. “Don’t vot­ers have a right to know where you stand?” Mr Stephanopo­u­los asked.</p>
    <p>That did not keep Repub­li­can strate­gist Ari Fleis­cher from com­plain­ing about what he deemed an overly easy night for Mr Bi­den. “NBC is an in­ter­ro­ga­tion,” he wrote on Twit­ter. “ABC is a pic­nic.”</p>
