    <p>The or­gan­is­ers of the coro­n­avirus-post­poned Tokyo 2020 Olympics yes­ter­day said they have picked a new cre­ative di­rec­tor to re­design “sim­pler and more re­strained” open­ing and clos­ing cer­e­monies for next year’s Games.</p>
    <p>The mam­moth task will fall to advertisin­g ex­ec­u­tive Hiroshi Sasaki, who helped pro­duce the Games’ hand­ing-over cer­e­mony from Rio de Janeiro in 2016 to Tokyo – fa­mously fea­tur­ing then Prime Min­is­ter Shinzo Abe as a char­ac­ter from the Su­per Mario video game.</p>
    <p>The or­gan­is­ers said the de­ci­sion to re­place a pre­vi­ous seven-per­son cre­ative team would im­prove ef­fi­ciency, as they re­shape the tra­di­tion­ally lav­ish and spec­tac­u­lar cer­e­monies to be “in tune with the sit­u­a­tion”.</p>
    <p>“The cer­e­monies will still be a great cel­e­bra­tion to be en­joyed by the ath­letes and watch­ing world but will likely take a sim­pler and more re­strained ap­proach de­signed to re­flect the over­all sim­pli­fi­ca­tion of the Games and the po­ten­tial need to still con­sider Covid-19 coun­ter­mea­sures,” an of­fi­cial state­ment read.</p>
    <p>The team led by Sasaki re­places one led by Man­sai No­mura, a mas­ter of tra­di­tional Kyo­gen comic the­atre who had pledged to pro­duce cer­e­monies “rich i n Ja­panese spirit”.</p>
    <p>Sasaki had de­signed the stripped-back event held in July to mark the one year to go un­til the post­poned Games.</p>
    <p>That saw Ja­panese swim­mer and leukaemia sur­vivor Rikako Ikee ap­pear in a dark­ened and empty sta­dium clutch­ing the Olympic flame in a lantern, which the or­gan­is­ers claimed was re­flec­tive of the prin­ci­ples that would guide the re­designed cer­e­monies.</p>
    <p>Speak­ing to re­porters, Sasaki said he still re­mem­bered watch­ing as a child the open­ing cer­e­mony for the 1964 Olympics, the first time Tokyo hosted the Sum­mer Games, and had en­joyed the tra­di­tion­ally lav­ish events open­ing and clos­ing the sport­ing event.</p>
    <p>“But now these flashy ex­trav­a­gant cer­e­monies are con­sid­ered as too much and we must think of this time as an op­por­tu­nity to change due to Covid-19, or rather thanks to Covid-19,” he said.</p>
    <p>Sasaki ad­mit­ted that he had yet to de­velop the di­rec­tion of the new cer­e­monies as “con­di­tions are tough”, but re­vealed they would em­pha­sise the theme of the Games serv­ing as the “light at the end of the tun­nel” af­ter the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>The or­gan­is­ers are press­ing ahead with prepa­ra­tions for the post­poned Games, an­nounc­ing a new budget, test-event sched­ule and coro­n­avirus coun­ter­mea­sures in re­cent weeks.</p>
    <p>But pub­lic opin­ion in Ja­pan re­mains op­posed to hold­ing the event next year, with a ma­jor­ity favour­ing a fur­ther de­lay or out­right can­cel­la­tion.</p>
    <p>The or­gan­is­ers an­nounced yes­ter­day that they have re­ceived re­quests for re­funds of around 200,000 tick­ets for Par­a­lympic events sold in Ja­pan, about 21 per cent of the to­tal.</p>
    <p>Ear­lier this month, they an­nounced re­fund re­quests for around 18 per cent of tick­ets sold do­mes­ti­cally for Olympic events.</p>
    <p>Fans who bought tick­ets over­seas have to ap­ply sep­a­rately for re­funds in their coun­tries, and no fig­ures for those have been made avail­able.</p>
