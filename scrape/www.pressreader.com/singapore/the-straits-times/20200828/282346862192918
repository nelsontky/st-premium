    <p>LON­DON • Manch­ester City are lead­ing the race to sign Barcelona su­per­star Lionel Messi, ac­cord­ing to mul­ti­ple me­dia re­ports.</p>
    <p>Cata­lan ra­dio sta­tion RAC1 and Ar­gen­tine tele­vi­sion chan­nel TyC Sports have re­ported that the Ar­gentina for­ward’s fa­ther Jorge is al­ready in Eng­land to ne­go­ti­ate a deal with the Premier League giants.</p>
    <p>Re­ports in Spain have also sug­gested that City man­ager Pep Guardi­ola, who spent four years in charge at Barcelona, has spo­ken to Messi in per­son.</p>
    <p>Messi Sr is con­sid­er­ing a twoyear deal – one that would al­ter City’s struc­ture. Un­der cur­rent club pol­icy, City will not of­fer multi-year deals to play­ers over 30. But such is the draw of Messi, 33, that City are “op­ti­mistic” of pulling off the big­gest trans­fer coup i n Premier League history, re­ported The Times of Lon­don.</p>
    <p>This is de­spite many other ob­sta­cles, not least a po­ten­tial le­gal dis­pute.</p>
    <p>Messi asked Barca on Tues­day to al­low him to leave the club he has been with for 20 sea­sons, since he was 13 years old.</p>
    <p>His lawyers have re­ferred to a clause in the four-year con­tract he signed in 2017 which would have al­lowed him to leave for free, but only if he re­quested it by June 10.</p>
    <p>They will ar­gue that the date – nom­i­nally the end of the sea­son – is ir­rel­e­vant af­ter the coro­n­avirus de­lays that led to the sea­son’s ex­ten­sion into this month.</p>
    <p>The club will con­tend that the June date holds and if so, a worl­drecord £200 mil­lion (S$360.6 mil­lion) fee might be re­quired for Messi to move to the Eti­had Sta­dium.</p>
    <p>Sources told The Times of Lon­don that City, who have been work­ing on this deal for over a week, have stated through chief ex­ec­u­tive Fer­ran So­ri­ano that they have the fi­nan­cial might to sign Messi.</p>
    <p>If any­thing, this is the type of mar­quee deal that the own­ers have craved for since the Abu Dhabi takeover of 2008.</p>
    <p>Like Guardi­ola, who won two Cham­pi­ons League ti­tles and three Span­ish La Liga crowns with Messi, So­ri­ano and direc­tor of foot­ball Txiki Be­giris­tain were pre­vi­ously with the Cata­lan giants, and those re­la­tion­ships can­not be un­der­es­ti­mated.</p>
    <p>Messi’s Barcelona con­tract is worth at least £78 mil­lion a year in wages and im­age-rights pay­ments. With per­for­mance-re­lated ad­dons, it goes up to £100 mil­lion.</p>
    <p>The sport’s high­est earner will re­quire City to over­haul their wage struc­ture, i n which Kevin de Bruyne has the big­gest ba­sic salary of £280,000 a week.</p>
    <p>City and any of the clubs chas­ing Messi’s signature – Manch­ester United, In­ter Mi­lan and Paris Saint-Ger­main have all been linked with the six-time Bal­lon d’Or win­ner – would ul­ti­mately need to con­form to Uefa’s Fi­nan­cial Fair Play (FFP) rules.</p>
    <p>The coro­n­avirus pan­demic has hurt the rev­enue streams of all clubs. But, iron­i­cally, it could also make sure a mam­moth deal is pos­si­ble as Uefa has re­laxed FFP reg­u­la­tions in an at­tempt to al­low clubs to tran­si­tion through the fi­nan­cial dif­fi­cul­ties. The orig­i­nal FFP rules did not al­low a deficit of more than €30 mil­lion (S$48.4 mil­lion) in a three-year pe­riod.</p>
    <p>Clubs will still need to struc­ture a cre­ative deal and a mar­ket­ing rev­enue boost if they were to sign</p>
    <p>Messi. A pos­si­bil­ity would be for Messi to be paid sep­a­rately as an am­bas­sador, re­ported The Times. For ex­am­ple, Qatar-owned PSG could con­sider sign­ing him up as an am­bas­sador for a Qatar-re­lated or­gan­i­sa­tion.</p>
    <p>Yet, new Barcelona sport­ing direc­tor Ra­mon Planes said the club re­main hope­ful of per­suad­ing Messi to stay.</p>
    <p>Many be­lieve Messi’s threat to leave is in fact a bid to oust Josep Maria Bar­tomeu, and he will stay if the Barcelona pres­i­dent goes.</p>
    <p>Span­ish foot­ball ex­pert Terry Gib­son told Sky Sports that Messi wants the club to come un­der new lead­er­ship a year be­fore Bar­tomeu’s ten­ure is due to ex­pire dur­ing next year’s elec­tions.</p>
    <p>“He can’t be elected to stay on for an­other term and I think this is a power play from Messi and his camp at the very least, if he has any in­ten­tion of stay­ing at the club, to make sure the pres­i­dent l eaves now,” Gib­son said.</p>
    <p>“If there is a choice be­tween the Barcelona sup­port­ers of who stays or who goes, be­tween Messi and the pres­i­dent, there’s only one win­ner there.”</p>
    <p>On Tues­day, frus­trated Barcelona fans gath­ered out­side the Nou Camp to protest and demand Bar­tomeu’s res­ig­na­tion.</p>
