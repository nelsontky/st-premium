    <p>For one sea­son only, Pier­paolo Pic­ci­oli moved the Valentino show from Paris to Mi­lan in a show of sup­port for the home coun­try of both its de­signer and brand.</p>
    <p>The show opened with sharp lit­tle blocks of black and white, be­fore print, colour and tex­ture seeped in to in­fuse the col­lec­tion with a light­hearted joy­ous­ness.</p>
    <p>All through­out, sil­hou­ettes were stream­lined, soft­ened, sim­pli­fied – ev­ery­thing grounded by flat shoes.</p>
    <p>Stand­out looks in­cluded in­tri­cate lace shirts for him and her. There were also other pieces which looked equally ar­rest­ing on both men and women, from blousons and suits with shorts to non­cha­lant blazer-and-blue-jeans com­bos.</p>
    <p>The jeans were a hit. Cre­ated in col­lab­o­ra­tion with Levi’s, they were an up­dated take on the iconic 517 style from the 60s, con­ceived through a process Pic­ci­oli called re­sig­ni­fi­ca­tion – the giv­ing of new value to sym­bols and ideas from a dif­fer­ent time which are still rel­e­vant today.</p>
    <p>Other el­e­ments that got the remix treat­ment were the brand’s sig­na­ture Rock­studs – now su­per­sized – and the col­lec­tion’s print of big, beau­ti­ful blooms (left), lifted from an archival dress.</p>
