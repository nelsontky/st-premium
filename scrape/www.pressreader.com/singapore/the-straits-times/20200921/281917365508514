    <p>Sin­ga­pore­ans aged 18 and above this year will re­ceive $100 each to spend on stay­ca­tions, tick­ets to leisure at­trac­tions, and lo­cal tours. This is a prac­ti­cal move to stim­u­late do­mes­tic spend­ing and save jobs in the tourism sec­tor. It is prac­ti­cal be­cause the du­ra­tion of the voucher pro­gramme is timed to co­in­cide with the March, June and De­cem­ber school hol­i­days, and to spread out de­mand in be­tween. It co­in­cides with the an­nounce­ment that tourist at­trac­tions can ap­ply to in­crease their op­er­at­ing ca­pac­ity to 50 per cent – up from the cur­rent 25 per cent. The $320 mil­lion Sin­gapo-Redis­cov­ers Vouch­ers scheme should help at­trac­tions to carry over their ca­pa­bil­i­ties, built up over the years, and look ahead, even as they con­sol­i­date ca­pac­ity in the in­terim.</p>
    <p>The sever­ity of the down­turn that marks the in­terim can­not be over­stated. The coro­n­avirus pan­demic has all but dec­i­mated the in­dus­try af­ter four years of con­sec­u­tive growth. In Fe­bru­ary, the Sin­ga­pore Tourism Board said the sec­tor was fac­ing its big­gest chal­lenge since the oc­cur­rence of Sars (se­vere acute res­pi­ra­tory syn­drome) in 2003. The ex­tent of that chal­lenge be­came clear in sub­se­quent months as Covid-19 rav­aged glob­alised economies, in­clud­ing Sin­ga­pore’s, par­tic­u­larly in sec­tors as­so­ci­ated with in­ter­na­tional travel. Un­like Sars, whose lethal­ity proved to be rel­a­tively short-lived, the eco­nomic af­ter-ef­fects of Covid-19 could be ex­pected to linger for quite some time.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, do­mes­tic con­sump­tion can go some way to­wards meet­ing the pre­cip­i­tous de­cline in in­ter­na­tional de­mand. This is not an un­rea­son­able ex­pec­ta­tion. Last year, visi­tors spent $27.7 bil­lion here. While that fig­ure is im­pres­sive, it is smaller than what Sin­ga­pore’s res­i­dent pop­u­la­tion spent on over­seas travel last year: $36.5 bil­lion. But if even a frac­tion of that spend­ing could be chan­nelled into do­mes­tic tourism, the sec­tor would ben­e­fit con­sid­er­ably. Ad­mit­tedly, Sin­ga­pore­ans would not want to spend large amounts within their own coun­try, which they know. In­deed, even their for­eign travel plans would have shrunk dur­ing a job-eat­ing re­ces­sion. How­ever, they are likely to give do­mes­tic tourism a chance if the at­trac­tions are safe, not too ex­pen­sive, and en­cour­age in­ter­ac­tion be­tween fam­ily and friends. Also, they ex­pect their tourism ex­pe­ri­ences to be au­then­tic, in the sense that they are not treated like for­eign tourists but as in­sid­ers who are of­fered deeper in­sights into the flora, fauna, his­tory and ar­chi­tec­ture of the coun­try.</p>
    <p>Com­pa­nies in the tourism busi­ness could col­lab­o­rate to pro­vide Sin­ga­pore­ans with that qual­ity ex­pe­ri­ence. The vouch­ers could spur dis­cre­tionary spend­ing that is re­quired to give tourism and those work­ing in the sec­tor a boost. In­no­va­tive pack­ages that com­bine dif­fer­ent ex­pe­ri­ences, from ho­tel stays to tours of at­trac­tions, are one way to turn Sin­ga­pore­ans into lo­cal tourists.</p>
