    <p>March 21 - April 19</p>
    <p>Your ac­tive mind is driv­ing you in a bold new di­rec­tion and you are en­joy­ing it. See if you can push your­self along in this new fash­ion for a while longer be­fore tak­ing stock.</p>
    <p>April 20 - May 20</p>
    <p>Though your peo­ple may be try­ing your pa­tience, you need to be tol­er­ant or at least make sure they think you are. It is eas­ier than you think and things could get bet­ter for you as a result.</p>
    <p>May 21 - June 20</p>
    <p>Use a lighter touch to get what you want – you may be sur­prised by how lit­tle ef­fort it takes to con­vince peo­ple. For that mat­ter, you should try to avoid heavy top­ics when­ever pos­si­ble.</p>
    <p>June 21 - July 22</p>
    <p>You should break all the bound­aries of ac­cept­able be­hav­iour (well, most of them, any­way) and show the world that you are un­pre­dictable. Only then can you take that next big step to progress.</p>
    <p>July 23 - Aug 22</p>
    <p>You need to share this glo­ri­ous feel­ing.</p>
    <p>All this ter­rific en­ergy needs an out­let, so make sure you find a way to get a friend or col­league to see things your way. It is eas­ier than you think.</p>
    <p>Aug 23 - Sept 22</p>
    <p>You need to be bet­ter or­gan­ised. To­day brings the chance to shake things up and get rid of old habits that have been keep­ing you clut­tered or oth­er­wise off the top of your game.</p>
    <p>Sept 23 - Oct 22</p>
    <p>You are ex­pected to di­rect peo­ple who are just as clue­less as you are. That is okay, though, be­cause you can fake it pretty well and you may be able to find your way out.</p>
    <p>Oct 23 - Nov 21</p>
    <p>Your ca­reer is com­ing to a cross­roads – are you ready for it? You should find that you need to speak with peo­ple you have not heard from in years to move ahead to where you need to be.</p>
    <p>Nov 22 - Dec 21</p>
    <p>You feel like tak­ing a chance and your en­ergy is so good that you may as well go for it.</p>
    <p>Even if it does not pay off in the short run, by trust­ing in the uni­verse, you are sig­nalling that you want a big­ger role.</p>
    <p>Dec 22 - Jan 19</p>
    <p>You are get­ting the blame for some­thing that is not your fault, but you may just have to bear it for now. The truth comes to light even­tu­ally, as it al­ways does, and jus­tice will be served.</p>
    <p>Jan 20 - Feb 18</p>
    <p>You are filled with cre­ative en­ergy, but it is not en­tirely pos­i­tive. That should not be a prob­lem, but watch out for over­do­ing it or con­fus­ing peo­ple to the point where they start to flee.</p>
    <p>Feb 19 - March 20</p>
    <p>There is just way too much go­ing on to­day – so much so that you may need to take a break or oth­er­wise beg off. There is no shame in that as long as you are clear about what is go­ing on and why.</p>
