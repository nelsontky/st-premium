    <p>MORI­NARI WATAN­ABE, FIG CHIEF, on coaches who want “ab­so­lute power”.</p>
    <p>NEW YORK Her stom­ach turned. She had to read the news twice. Hailee Hoff­man (pic­tured), a for­mer Stan­ford gym­nast, could not be­lieve what she was see­ing.</p>
    <p>Mary Wright, her coach when she trained at Olym­pus Gym­nas­tics out­side Salt Lake City, was named to the USA Gym­nas­tics Hall of Fame, and the tim­ing that day in Au­gust could not have been more awk­ward.</p>
    <p>Days be­fore, Hoff­man had filed a for­mal com­plaint against Wright with the US Cen­tre for SafeS­port, an in­de­pen­dent body that handles abuse and mis­con­duct cases in Olympic sports.</p>
    <p>She ac­cused Wright, who has coached Olympians and na­tional team mem­bers from sev­eral coun­tries, of years of emo­tional, phys­i­cal and ver­bal abuse.</p>
    <p>“I feel morally ob­li­gated to speak out be­cause Mary’s abu­sive coach­ing was so se­ri­ously dam­ag­ing that it’s taken me years to process the ex­tent of it,” said Hoff­man, 24.</p>
    <p>“It’s crazy to cel­e­brate some­one like that, es­pe­cially right now when the sport is try­ing to get away from its toxic cul­ture.”</p>
    <p>Wright did not an­swer sev­eral email and phone mes­sages. USA Gym­nas­tics stood by the award, say­ing no com­plaint had been re­ceived at the time the de­ci­sion was made to be­stow it in 2017 or be­fore the day of the an­nounce­ment in Au­gust.</p>
    <p>The Cen­tre for SafeS­port for­warded Hoff­man’s com­plaint to the fed­er­a­tion two days after the award was made pub­lic.</p>
    <p>USA Gym­nas­tics said in a state­ment that it “would re­con­sider the in­duc­tion if and when a case is ad­ju­di­cated, if nec­es­sary”.</p>
    <p>Four other gym­nasts and three par­ents of chil­dren who trained at Olym­pus Gym­nas­tics also told The New York Times that they – or in the case of the par­ents, their chil­dren – were abused by Wright.</p>
    <p>One coach who worked along­side Wright for more than a decade said she was aghast when the lat­ter was named to the Hall of Fame be­cause she be­lieved Wright had treated her gym­nasts harshly.</p>
    <p>All but one of those peo­ple who con­firmed Hoff­man’s ac­cu­sa­tions asked to re­main anony­mous be­cause they are still con­nected to the sport and feared ret­ri­bu­tion.</p>
    <p>Kelle Land, whose young daugh­ter trained at Olym­pus Gym­nas­tics for four years, said she was pre­par­ing to join Hoff­man’s case against Wright.</p>
    <p>Land was so turned off by the coach­ing at Olym­pus, she said, that she switched to an­other gym.</p>
    <p>“Mary would be down­right mean, aw­ful and hurt­ful to the girls, and it was al­most like she wanted to see how badly she could emo­tion­ally de­grade those kids or phys­i­cally break them,” she said.</p>
    <p>“You would think USA Gym­nas­tics would do ev­ery­thing in its power to get these bad coaches out of the sys­tem and not, at the very least, ap­plaud them.”</p>
    <p>The ac­cu­sa­tions have sur­faced as hun­dreds of gym­nasts world­wide have spo­ken out re­cently about an op­pres­sive cul­ture in the sport that they feel has been driven by tyran­ni­cal coaches who scare young ath­letes into obe­di­ence.</p>
    <p>The gym­nasts said it went beyond tough coach­ing and crossed into emo­tional or phys­i­cal abuse. Many spoke out after watch­ing the Net­flix doc­u­men­tary “Ath­lete A”, which chron­i­cles gym­nas­tics’ pun­ish­ing cul­ture and the sex­ual abuse in­flicted on more than 200 girls and women by Larry Nas­sar, a for­mer US na­tional team doc­tor who is serv­ing a lengthy prison term.</p>
    <p>Mori­nari Watan­abe, pres­i­dent of the In­ter­na­tional Gym­nas­tics Fed­er­a­tion, said in an on­line ad­dress last month that the men­tal­ity of coaches try­ing to gain “ab­so­lute power” over their ath­letes is an an­ti­quated, dan­ger­ous way of coach­ing.</p>
    <p>“If we don’t break it, the prob­lem will con­tinue for­ever,” he added.</p>
    <p>Hoff­man said Wright per­pet­u­ated the sport’s abu­sive cul­ture. She claimed Wright had pub­licly ridiculed her, call­ing her stupid, lazy and fat, and pres­sured her to train while in­jured, in­clud­ing on what turned out to be two bro­ken an­kles.</p>
    <p>Hoff­man, who re­tired from the sport after her 2019 sea­son at Stan­ford, said train­ing un­der Wright caused panic at­tacks, de­pres­sion, a re­cur­ring bat­tle with bu­limia and a dam­aged self-es­teem that has af­fected her per­sonal re­la­tion­ships.</p>
    <p>To keep Wright from harm­ing more chil­dren, Hoff­man plans to push for her to re­ceive a life­time ban from the sport be­cause “the pain she caused so many young girls was just so last­ing”.</p>
    <p>Wright, 70, started coach­ing gym­nas­tics as a teenager in her na­tive New Zealand, be­fore mov­ing to the United States in 1975, where she quickly rose in the sport.</p>
    <p>For about a decade, start­ing in 1979, she worked with Don Peters, the 1984 Olympic coach, as his as­sis­tant at Scats Gym­nas­tics in Cal­i­for­nia.</p>
    <p>Peters has since been barred for life after ac­cu­sa­tions he had sex with sev­eral gym­nasts un­der him in the 80s.</p>
    <p>At Olym­pus Gym­nas­tics, the Utah club Wright opened in 1993, she prided her­self on help­ing dozens of gym­nasts, in­clud­ing Hoff­man – more than 100 in all, by her count – earn col­lege schol­ar­ships in the sport.</p>
    <p>In re­cent years, Wright had been work­ing with New Zealand’s na­tional team and is now one of many coaches there un­der in­ves­ti­ga­tion by an in­de­pen­dent com­mis­sion or­gan­ised by Gym­nas­tics New Zealand, the na­tional pro­gramme, for emo­tional abuse, phys­i­cal abuse and bul­ly­ing.</p>
    <p>The in­de­pen­dent re­view, led by David How­man, the for­mer direc­tor-gen­eral of the World Anti-Dop­ing Agency, is look­ing at spe­cific cases of phys­i­cal and psy­cho­log­i­cal abuse at both the club- and na­tional-team lev­els, and also ex­am­in­ing the sport’s cul­ture.</p>
