    <p>LONDON/BER­LIN/CHAMPS SUR MARNE • Night­clubs around Europe are closed. But that does not mean the con­ti­nent’s party peo­ple are stay­ing home.</p>
    <p>As coro­n­avirus lock­downs are eased, il­le­gal raves are grow­ing in pop­u­lar­ity.</p>
    <p>Out­door events for hun­dreds, or in some cases thou­sands, or­gan­ised via so­cial me­dia and mes­sag­ing apps are in full swing ev­ery week­end, caus­ing headaches for po­lice forces and law­mak­ers, and stir­ring pub­lic de­bate and news me­dia panic.</p>
    <p>Some coun­tries have tried bring­ing night­clubs back.</p>
    <p>In Switzer­land, most re­gions let such venues re­open in June, pro­vided that they kept at­ten­dees’ con­tact de­tails.</p>
    <p>Af­ter many par­ty­go­ers gave false in­for­ma­tion, ID checks be­came manda­tory in some ar­eas.</p>
    <p>Clubs in Barcelona, Spain, re­opened at the end of June but shut again a few weeks later as the virus surged in the city.</p>
    <p>In most coun­tries, the idea of packed dance floors is too much to even con­sider right now.</p>
    <p>Many night­club op­er­a­tors fear they will be the last busi­nesses al­lowed to re­open.</p>
    <p>Un­til then, thou­sands are par­ty­ing in se­cret de­spite the risk and the back­lash.</p>
    <p>The week­end be­fore last, New York Times re­porters at­tended three events, in Ber­lin, London and near Paris. Here is what they saw.</p>
    <p>FACE MASKS AB­SENT AT PACKED DANCE AREA IN BER­LIN</p>
    <p>BER­LIN • It was mid­night on Aug 1, and a rave in a field on the north­east­ern out­skirts of Ber­lin was just get­ting started.</p>
    <p>A DJ in shorts stood near turnta­bles con­nected to a gen­er­a­tor, play­ing a warm blend of house mu­sic and techno.</p>
    <p>A tent sell­ing beer had been set up nearby, and multi-coloured lights had been af­fixed to the trees.</p>
    <p>The crowd of about 200 was get­ting big­ger by the minute.</p>
    <p>De­spite the sign in­struct­ing par­ty­go­ers to keep a dis­tance of at least 1.5m, the dance area was packed, and no­body was wear­ing a mask.</p>
    <p>IL­LE­GAL ‘FREE PAR­TIES’ ON THE SURGE NEAR PARIS</p>
    <p>NEAR PARIS • In nor­mal times, the forested shore of the Etang de la Haute Mai­son, a pond about 19km east of Paris, is a cov­eted spot for fish­er­men on the look­out for carp or pike.</p>
    <p>But on the night of Aug 1, a dif­fer­ent crowd gath­ered in the woods by the wa­ter: Around 400 young peo­ple, mov­ing to techno mu­sic that boomed from loud­speak­ers as spot­lights swept a dance floor.</p>
    <p>The pop­u­lar­ity of these “free par­ties”, as the il­le­gal events are known here, has been surg­ing in re­cent months.</p>
    <p>“It is true, since the end of the lock­down, we have seen many more peo­ple at­tend­ing the free par­ties,” said 26-year-old Julien Faux, a reg­u­lar at­tendee of the events since be­fore the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>The event, called The Piracy, had all the trap­pings of a le­gal party: A ded­i­cated Face­book page ad­ver­tised a line-up of DJs, and tick­ets were sold on­line.</p>
    <p>The dif­fer­ence was that the lo­ca­tion was re­leased by e-mail only less than an hour be­fore The Piracy be­gan.</p>
    <p>It came with a warn­ing to ap­proach the site qui­etly and not to tell any­one else where it was. “It is all about the smooth con­duct of the party,” said the e-mail.</p>
    <p>It added that par­ty­go­ers should bring masks and re­spect so­cial dis­tanc­ing mea­sures.</p>
    <p>That turned out to be wish­ful think­ing.</p>
    <p>DE­TAILS SENT VIA WHAT­SAPP FOR PARTY IN LONDON</p>
    <p>LONDON • Just af­ter mid­night on July 31, two young men stood on a street in the Tot­ten­ham dis­trict, sur­rounded by brick ware­houses, look­ing lost. “Are you going to the rave?” one man with a posh ac­cent asked a passer-by.</p>
    <p>The de­tails of the party they were look­ing for had been sent to a group on the mes­sag­ing app a few hours be­fore: To join, you had to sub­mit a so­cial me­dia ac­count so or­gan­is­ers could check you out. Ad­vance tick­ets were sold via PayPal.</p>
    <p>Mes­sages in the What­sApp group in­cluded ap­peals for dis­cre­tion. “We are pro­tect­ing our com­mu­nity,” read one. “Don’t share our (in­for­ma­tion) to any­one,” it added.</p>
    <p>“It is like a mil­i­tary op­er­a­tion,” said one of the plummy-voiced men, af­ter fi­nally de­ci­pher­ing the map. “If peo­ple put half as much ef­fort into solv­ing coro­n­avirus, we would all be out of it by now.”</p>
    <p>Soon, af­ter walk­ing through an un­der­pass, the thud-thud-thud of a kick drum came into earshot and the two men walked up a path towards the sound.</p>
    <p>Af­ter a quick bag search by se­cu­rity guards, they moved into a wood­land clear­ing, where about 300 peo­ple were danc­ing to house mu­sic, the trees around them il­lu­mi­nated by green and pur­ple lights.</p>
