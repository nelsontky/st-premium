    <p>Out­go­ing Ja­panese Prime Min­is­ter Shinzo Abe’s trusted lieu­tenant, top govern­ment spokesman Yoshi­hide Suga, is the front run­ner in the race to suc­ceed him. While Mr Suga, 71, has long de­nied har­bour­ing am­bi­tions for the top job in the world’s third-largest econ­omy, his en­try into the race has been de­scribed by do­mes­tic me­dia as a “seis­mic shift”.</p>
    <p>Out­go­ing Ja­panese Prime Min­is­ter Shinzo Abe’s trusty lieu­tenant, top govern­ment spokesman Yoshi­hide Suga, has emerged as the front run­ner in a race to take charge of the world’s third-largest econ­omy.</p>
    <p>This is de­spite for­mer de­fence min­is­ter Shigeru Ishiba be­ing by far the pub­lic’s pre­ferred pick, ac­cord­ing to two weekend me­dia sur­veys.</p>
    <p>While Mr Suga, 71, has long de­nied har­bour­ing any am­bi­tions for the top job, his en­try into the race – set to be con­firmed as soon as to­day – has been de­scribed by do­mes­tic me­dia as a “seis­mic shift”.</p>
    <p>There is no clear heir ap­par­ent to Mr Abe, 65, who abruptly re­signed last Fri­day over a flare-up of a chronic condition as his pub­lic ap­proval rat­ings nose­dived.</p>
    <p>But Mr Suga is seen by the top brass in the rul­ing Lib­eral Demo­cratic Party (LDP) as the ideal con­ti­nu­ity can­di­date: a sta­ble pair of hands to con­tinue Mr Abe’s work and po­ten­tially a uni­fy­ing fig­ure among ri­val fac­tions.</p>
    <p>He is Ja­pan’s long­est-serv­ing Chief Cabi­net Sec­re­tary, hav­ing been in the role since Mr Abe’s elec­tion in December 2012, and has been a rare con­stant through six Cabi­net reshuf­fles.</p>
    <p>But although he is the face of the govern­ment, he ap­pears less pop­u­lar among the pub­lic. The moniker “Un­cle Reiwa”, given for un­veil­ing Ja­pan’s im­pe­rial name last year, has not struck a chord as the pub­lic sees him as stern and no-non­sense.</p>
    <p>The LDP’s next pres­i­dent will be cho­sen in a scaled-down party vote on Sept 14, lo­cal me­dia said yes­ter­day, though some party mem­bers are lob­by­ing for a full vote. The Diet, as Ja­pan’s par­lia­men­tary body is known, will con­vene on Sept 17 to of­fi­cially name the new prime min­is­ter. As the LDP has a ma­jor­ity in the Diet, the party leader tra­di­tion­ally be­comes prime min­is­ter.</p>
    <p>The LDP pres­i­dent’s post typ­i­cally car­ries a ten­ure of three years, but the win­ner this time will only see out the re­main­der of Mr Abe’s term, which ends in September next year.</p>
    <p>The elec­tion process is to be con­firmed to­day, but it is likely that the new leader will be cho­sen by just 535 peo­ple – the LDP’s 394 Diet mem­bers and three rep­re­sen­ta­tives from each of the 47 pre­fec­tural party chap­ters.</p>
    <p>This will hugely dis­ad­van­tage Mr Ishiba, 63, who has cast him­self as an em­pa­thetic ev­ery­day man with his con­stant crit­i­cisms of Mr Abe’s poli­cies and crony­ism scan­dals.</p>
    <p>The na­tive of Ja­pan’s least-pop­u­lated pre­fec­ture Tot­tori is pop­u­lar among ru­ral grassroots mem­bers, but less so among those LDP mem­bers keen to toe the party line.</p>
    <p>He is also rated highly by the pub­lic for his me­dia savvi­ness, fre­quently ap­pear­ing on news pro­grammes, and for his un­abashed crit­i­cisms of Mr Abe’s gov­er­nance and fre­quent crony­ism scan­dals.</p>
    <p>Ja­pan’s op­po­si­tion has long been in dis­ar­ray – a new party will be formed on Sept 16 through the merger of two nascent groups that are barely three years old – mak­ing Mr Ishiba the ideal PM for a pub­lic that wants to stick with the LDP but is not a fan of Mr Abe.</p>
    <p>He was the clear pub­lic favourite in two weekend me­dia polls.</p>
    <p>Ky­odo News placed Mr Ishiba at 34.3 per cent, fol­lowed by Mr Suga at 14.3 per cent. They were fol­lowed by De­fence Min­is­ter Taro Kono (13.6 per cent), En­vi­ron­ment Min­is­ter Shin­jiro Koizumi (10.1 per cent), and for­mer for­eign min­is­ter Fu­mio Kishida (7.5 per cent).</p>
    <p>An­other poll, by Nikkei and TV Tokyo, placed Mr Ishiba at 28 per cent, fol­lowed by Mr Kono (15 per cent) and Mr Koizumi (14 per cent). Mr Suga was fourth at 11 per cent, with Mr Kishida trail­ing at 6 per cent.</p>
    <p>The odds, how­ever, are stacked against Mr Ishiba given the LDP’s fac­tional pol­i­tics, where law­mak­ers tend to vote along fac­tion lines.</p>
    <p>Mr Suga does not be­long to any fac­tion, but has won the back­ing of ma­jor fac­tions led by LDP sec­re­tary-gen­eral Toshi­hiro Nikai and Deputy Prime Min­is­ter Taro Aso.</p>
    <p>Mr Kishida, once Mr Abe’s named pre­ferred suc­ces­sor, re­mains keen on the race, and is try­ing to win the sup­port of the LDP’s largest fac­tion, which is led by for­mer chief Cabi­net sec­re­tary Hiroyuki Hosoda and counts Mr Abe as a mem­ber.</p>
    <p>Sophia Univer­sity po­lit­i­cal sci­en­tist Koichi Nakano does not ex­pect any sur­prises. He told The Straits Times: “Ja­pan can­not af­ford a po­lit­i­cal vac­uum, and so the co-pi­lot is be­ing seen as the best per­son to take over when the pi­lot has left.”</p>
    <p>But he cau­tioned: “If rank-and­file LDP mem­bers can­not vote, Suga may not be seen as a le­git­i­mate suc­ces­sor. And if he does not do well in the next gen­eral elec­tion (which must be called by Oc­to­ber next year), his days as PM might be quite short.”</p>
