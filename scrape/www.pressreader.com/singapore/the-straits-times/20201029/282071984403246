    <p>A di­rec­tor of a firm which deals with the print­ing of card­board pack­ages was sen­tenced to 30 months’ jail af­ter cheat­ing a bank of more than $2 mil­lion in loans be­tween 2016 and 2018.</p>
    <p>Chong Teng Siow, 61, pleaded guilty yes­ter­day to eight counts of en­gag­ing in a con­spir­acy to cheat The Bank of East Asia.</p>
    <p>Another 20 sim­i­lar charges were taken into con­sid­er­a­tion by District Judge Ong Luan Tze dur­ing sen­tenc­ing.</p>
    <p>Court doc­u­ments state that Chong was the man­ag­ing di­rec­tor of Jit Sheng Graphic & Pa­per Man­u­fac­tur­ing at the time of his of­fences. The com­pany is now in liq­ui­da­tion, ac­cord­ing to an on­line search.</p>
    <p>Jit Sheng and The Bank of East Asia had an agree­ment where the com­pany could re­ceive loans of up to 95 per cent of amounts owed to it by its cus­tomers based on in­voices it sub­mit­ted to the bank, capped at $500,000.</p>
    <p>The court heard that be­tween 2016 and 2018, the com­pany in­curred losses due to poor busi­ness, fi­nan­cial mis­man­age­ment and Chong’s health prob­lems.</p>
    <p>In order to keep Jit Sheng’s op­er­a­tions run­ning, Chong in­structed Ms Doreen Toh Bee Ghuan, an ad­min­is­tra­tive as­sis­tant at the com­pany, to pre­pare fic­ti­tious in­voices on mul­ti­ple oc­ca­sions be­tween 2016 and 2018.</p>
    <p>These in­voices pur­port­edly showed that Jit Sheng had en­gaged in busi­ness trans­ac­tions with var­i­ous other firms – such as Sats Catering and Emi­cakes – for the print­ing of cus­tomised card­board box pack­ag­ing. They also falsely stated that the firms had to re­pay Jit Sheng on “a credit pay­ment term ba­sis”.</p>
    <p>The in­voices were used to de­ceive the bank into dis­burs­ing credit fa­cil­i­ties to the com­pany.</p>
    <p>When forg­ing some of the in­voices, Ms Toh would use a pho­to­copied ver­sion of the re­spec­tive firm’s com­pany stamp, which she had ob­tained from doc­u­ments used in gen­uine trans­ac­tions be­tween Jit Sheng and the firms.</p>
    <p>Chong or Ms Toh would also sign on these in­voices to make them ap­pear gen­uine.</p>
    <p>The duo’s ac­tions led the bank to is­sue more than $2 mil­lion in credit fa­cil­i­ties to Jit Sheng.</p>
    <p>The court heard that Chong has made resti­tu­tion of nearly $1.6 mil­lion, and that he had vol­un­tar­ily sur­ren­dered him­self to the po­lice even though the bank did not make a po­lice re­port.</p>
    <p>District Judge Ong later granted his re­quest to de­fer his jail term to Nov 9, so that he can go for a med­i­cal ap­point­ment next week to col­lect med­i­ca­tion for his ex­ist­ing health is­sues.</p>
