    <p>Work­place in­juries fell by 25 per cent in the first half of this year, likely due to the sus­pen­sion of se­lected work­place ac­tiv­i­ties from April to June amid the coro­n­avirus pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Work­place fa­tal­i­ties, how­ever, saw just a slight im­prove­ment over the same pe­riod, with falls from height and ve­hic­u­lar-re­lated in­ci­dents ac­count­ing for the most deaths.</p>
    <p>The num­ber of in­juries at work be­tween Jan­uary and June this year was 4,996, com­pared with 6,630 in the same pe­riod last year.</p>
    <p>There were 16 work­place deaths in the first six months of the year – close to the 17 fa­tal­i­ties in the first half of last year, but al­most a third lower than the 22 deaths from last July to De­cem­ber.</p>
    <p>These sta­tis­tics were pro­vided by the Min­istry of Man­power (MOM) and the Work­place Safety and Health (WSH) Coun­cil yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Ma­jor and mi­nor in­juries were mostly caused by slips, trips and falls, though on the whole, the num­ber of such cases fell from 1,862 in the first half of last year to 1,508 in the same pe­riod this year.</p>
    <p>The man­u­fac­tur­ing in­dus­try was the top con­trib­u­tor to non-fatal in­juries, with 40 ma­jor in­juries and 971 mi­nor cases. It also had three work­place deaths.</p>
    <p>Across all sec­tors, the sec­ond­most com­mon cause of in­juries was ma­chin­ery-re­lated, with 809 such cases in the first half of this year. There were 1,119 ma­chin­ery-re­lated cases from Jan­uary to June last year.</p>
    <p>The 12-month fa­tal­ity rate for the trans­porta­tion and stor­age in­dus­try also in­creased, from 3.1 per 100,000 work­ers as at end-De­cem­ber last year, to 3.8 as at end-June this year. MOM and the WSH Coun­cil said the in­dus­try ac­counted for the high­est num­ber of deaths at the work­place, with five cases in the first half of this year.</p>
    <p>Over­all, the lead­ing cause of fatal in­juries con­tin­ued to be falls from height and ve­hic­u­lar-re­lated in­ci­dents. These ac­counted for four and three deaths re­spec­tively in the first half of this year.</p>
    <p>The con­struc­tion in­dus­try, which ground to a near-com­plete halt in April dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker pe­riod, saw three work­place deaths in the first six months of this year – half of the sec­tor’s fa­tal­i­ties in the same pe­riod last year. All three deaths oc­curred in the first quar­ter of the year.</p>
    <p>The in­dus­try also saw 26 cases of ma­jor in­juries in the first six months, com­pared with 61 cases in the same pe­riod last year.</p>
    <p>There were four work­place in­ci­dents where many lives were at risk – clas­si­fied as dan­ger­ous oc­cur­rences – from Jan­uary to June. Two were fire and ex­plo­sion cases, while the other two were crane-re­lated in­ci­dents.</p>
    <p>The num­ber of oc­cu­pa­tional dis­eases also fell by about a quar­ter, from 264 cases in the first half of last year to 195 cases in the same pe­riod this year. The top two dis­eases were work-re­lated mus­cu­loskele­tal dis­or­ders such as sprains, repet­i­tive stress syn­drome and mus­cle strain, and noise-in­duced deaf­ness, ac­count­ing for about nine in 10 cases.</p>
    <p>The WSH Coun­cil said it has been en­gag­ing in­dus­tries on restart­ing work safely fol­low­ing the lift­ing of cir­cuit breaker mea­sures.</p>
    <p>From the fourth quar­ter of this year, the WSH per­for­mance of com­pa­nies will be pub­lished, start­ing with con­struc­tion com­pa­nies. Un­safe con­trac­tors will be dis­qual­i­fied from public con­struc­tion ten­ders.</p>
    <p>Since Sept 1, em­ploy­ers have also been re­quired to re­port all work ac­ci­dents that re­sult in med­i­cal leave or light duty.</p>
    <p>Re­spond­ing to the sta­tis­tics yes­ter­day, Na­tional Trades Union Congress as­sis­tant sec­re­tary-gen­eral Melvin Yong en­cour­aged com­pa­nies to im­ple­ment a struc­tured re­ori­en­ta­tion pro­gramme and WSH re­fresher cour­ses for re­turn­ing work­ers, es­pe­cially at high-risk work sites.</p>
