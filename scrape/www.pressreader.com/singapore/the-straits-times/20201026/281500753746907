    <p>To quickly de­tect and iso­late asymp­to­matic Covid-19 cases among mi­grant work­ers, the Min­istry of Man­power (MOM) and the Min­istry of Health (MOH) have started pi­lot­ing the use of anti­gen rapid tests, which can give re­sults within 30 min­utes.</p>
    <p>The new tests will form part of the ex­ist­ing ros­tered rou­tine test­ing (RRT) of work­ers, which has helped to pick up new in­fec­tions among them.</p>
    <p>Un­der the RRT, work­ers are al­ready tested ev­ery 14 days us­ing the more ac­cu­rate poly­merase chain re­ac­tion (PCR) test. How­ever, it takes at least a day for the PCR re­sults to come back.</p>
    <p>The pi­lot pro­gramme, which started on Oct 18, in­volves some 1,000 work­ers stay­ing in SCM Tuas Lodge dor­mi­tory.</p>
    <p>It comes as agen­cies here work out ways to in­cor­po­rate fast test­ing into Sin­ga­pore’s Covid-19 re­sponse, in­clud­ing hav­ing such rapid tests avail­able at cer­tain mass events in the com­ing months.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, Dr Lam Meng Chon, med­i­cal di­rec­tor of MOM’s As­sur­ance, Care and En­gage­ment (Ace) Group that sup­ports mi­grant work­ers and dorm op­er­a­tions, said this “helps to break the chain of trans­mis­sion and re­duce the risk of spread within the dor­mi­to­ries”.</p>
    <p>He added that by in­creas­ing the test­ing fre­quency, they would be able to pick out pos­i­tive cases that might have oth­er­wise slipped through.</p>
    <p>The anti­gen rapid test will be used as an ad­di­tional test on the seventh day of the 14-day RRT cy­cle, to com­ple­ment the PCR test on the 14th day. This means that work­ers will have to take a Covid-19 test ev­ery seven days dur­ing the pi­lot.</p>
    <p>Re­sults from the anti­gen rapid tests are out within 30 min­utes. A nasal swab is used to take a sam­ple from the lower part of the nose.</p>
    <p>Such tests, how­ever, are less ac­cu­rate than PCR tests, which are cur­rently used to defini­tively con­firm coro­n­avirus cases and re­main the most ac­cu­rate tests avail­able to­day.</p>
    <p>Dr Lam noted that be­cause of the anti­gen rapid test’s lower speci­ficity, a pos­i­tive case is just a sus­pected Covid-19 case. Those who test pos­i­tive will be iso­lated im­me­di­ately and sent for a con­fir­ma­tory PCR test.</p>
    <p>Fewer close con­tacts will need to be quar­an­tined, min­imis­ing work dis­rup­tions for work­ers and em­ploy­ers.</p>
    <p>The pi­lot will run for a pe­riod of four weeks be­fore its ef­fec­tive­ness is as­sessed. If it works well, it may be scaled up and ex­panded to cover more mi­grant work­ers.</p>
    <p>Ms Koh Guat Siew, vice-pres­i­dent of hu­man re­source op­er­a­tions at Sem­b­corp Marine, said the firm can take fol­low-up ac­tion sooner if the test re­sults are out ear­lier. “We can be as­sured that once a worker goes back to work, the risk is min­i­mal,” she added.</p>
    <p>Qual­ity con­trol tech­ni­cal en­gi­neer Sikder Ma­sud, 34, who took the rapid test last week, said: “With the test, I can get the re­sults faster and it is less un­com­fort­able. I also feel safer when I go to work.”</p>
    <p>Last Tues­day, MOH said that pre-event test­ing for Covid-19 will be a re­quire­ment at cer­tain mass events in the months ahead. Par­tic­i­pants will have to take an anti­gen rapid test and ob­tain a neg­a­tive re­sult be­fore they can gain en­try.</p>
    <p>New ground will be bro­ken this week when par­tic­i­pants at the Sin­ga­pore Internatio­nal En­ergy Week (SIEW) 2020 un­dergo pre-event swab tests for Covid-19.</p>
    <p>The tests are part of a pi­lot to en­able more ac­tiv­i­ties, in­clud­ing large-scale events, to re­sume safely.</p>
    <p>They will em­ploy anti­gen rapid tests (ART), which are faster but less sen­si­tive than poly­merase chain re­ac­tion (PCR) ones.</p>
    <p>A suc­cess­ful pi­lot might pave the way for looser re­stric­tions on group sizes for gath­er­ings, which are now capped at five.</p>
    <p>Health Min­is­ter Gan Kim Yong said last week: “This does not mean that we can throw cau­tion to the wind and ig­nore safe man­age­ment mea­sures at these events. So even if the test re­sults are neg­a­tive, safe man­age­ment mea­sures will still have to be strictly ad­hered to.”</p>
    <p>The En­ergy Mar­ket Au­thor­ity (EMA), which is or­gan­is­ing the con­ven­tion that runs from to­day to Fri­day, told The Straits Times that safe man­age­ment mea­sures will be in place for all on-site ac­tiv­i­ties.</p>
    <p>ST un­der­stands that par­tic­i­pants have been told to ar­rive 30 min­utes be­fore the con­fer­ence be­gins to reg­is­ter and take their tests.</p>
    <p>They will be able to col­lect their badges for the event while wait­ing for test re­sults, which should take about 15 min­utes or so.</p>
    <p>The re­sults will be sent to par­tic­i­pants via SMS. Those test­ing neg­a­tive will be able to go to their meet­ings, which will take place in zones of up to 50 peo­ple.</p>
    <p>They can in­ter­act with the other del­e­gates in their zone but must re­main masked and stay 1m apart from one an­other while be­ing seated at ta­bles of up to five peo­ple.</p>
    <p>Par­tic­i­pants test­ing pos­i­tive must re­turn to the reg­is­tra­tion area where they will be taken to an iso­lated site for a free PCR test to con­firm their re­sults.</p>
    <p>Re­sults of this test will take from 90 min­utes to two hours, far faster than the usual PCR turn­around time of one to two days.</p>
    <p>Aside from the pre-event test­ing, SIEW 2020 will be held in a hy­brid for­mat that com­bines on-site events at the Sands Expo and Con­ven­tion Cen­tre with vir­tual ones.</p>
    <p>This hy­brid for­mat was ear­lier tried here at the In­dus­trial Trans­for­ma­tion Asia-Pa­cific event held last Tues­day.</p>
    <p>How­ever, SIEW 2020 will be the first pi­lot meet­ings, in­cen­tives, con­ven­tions and ex­hi­bi­tions (MICE) event host­ing up to 250 at­ten­dees on site un­der the Sin­ga­pore Tourism Board’s Safe Business Events Frame­work.</p>
    <p>The EMA said: “With live stream­ing, many more lo­cal and over­seas par­tic­i­pants are ex­pected to par­tic­i­pate vir­tu­ally. This will fa­cil­i­tate ex­chang­ing of views and per­spec­tives on en­ergy is­sues across the week.”</p>
    <p>ST un­der­stands that a team of 35 so­cial dis­tanc­ing am­bas­sadors will be de­ployed at the Asia Clean En­ergy Sum­mit, which spans three of the five days of SIEW 2020, to en­sure par­tic­i­pants com­ply with safety mea­sures.</p>
    <p>Au­di­ence mem­bers on site will also not be al­lowed to ask ques­tions as it would be dif­fi­cult to pass the mi­cro­phone around while ob­serv­ing safe dis­tanc­ing.</p>
    <p>One par­tic­i­pant, Dr Thomas Reindl, deputy chief ex­ec­u­tive of the Na­tional Univer­sity of Sin­ga­pore’s So­lar En­ergy Re­search In­sti­tute of Sin­ga­pore, said pre-event test­ing would give peace of mind.</p>
    <p>“This could be a model event for how fu­ture larger-scale gath­er­ings in Sin­ga­pore could grad­u­ally be held again,” he added.</p>
    <p>Other par­tic­i­pants ST spoke to were sup­port­ive of the mea­sures.</p>
    <p>Asia-Europe Foun­da­tion com­mu­ni­ca­tions di­rec­tor Lawrence An­der­son said: “SIEW is be­ing very re­spon­si­ble in in­sti­tut­ing such mea­sures. I do not have a prob­lem with the on-site tests which I un­der­stand will only take a few min­utes.”</p>
    <p>Mr Ni­co­las Leong, the en­ergy business di­rec­tor for North and South-east Asia at Wart­sila, pointed out that the hy­brid nature of the event could be a good thing.</p>
    <p>“In­dus­try par­tic­i­pa­tion and reach seems to have in­creased with those (un­able) to at­tend the event per­son­ally also be­ing able to ac­tively par­tic­i­pate and con­trib­ute through a vir­tual plat­form,” he said.</p>
    <p>G8 Sub­sea man­ag­ing di­rec­tor Ger­ald Tan said the event would be a test of the ef­fec­tive­ness of var­i­ous vir­tual plat­forms be­ing used for ex­hi­bi­tions and con­fer­ences.</p>
    <p>He added: “It will be in­ter­est­ing to see how we can hold im­por­tant net­work­ing events like this while en­sur­ing we keep with Covid-19 mea­sures.”</p>
