    <p>Each Sin­ga­pore res­i­dent will be able to col­lect a pair of re­us­able masks from Nov 30, in the third na­tion­wide mask distributi­on by Te­masek Foun­da­tion.</p>
    <p>Some vend­ing ma­chines across the is­land have al­ready be­gun re­stock­ing the mask kits, with col­lec­tion to be­gin at 10am on Nov 30 and end on Dec 13.</p>
    <p>Te­masek chief ex­ec­u­tive and ex­ec­u­tive di­rec­tor Ho Ching said in a Face­book post yesterday that the masks are “breath­able an­timi­cro­bial 3D masks” from local company Proshield.</p>
    <p>The 3D masks are shaped to fit the face, and are sim­i­lar to the ones dis­trib­uted in the Na­tional Day pack for ev­ery house­hold, she noted.</p>
    <p>Each kit will con­sist of two re­us­able masks along with three ad­di­tional fil­ters. The mask has a pocket where the fil­ters can be in­serted, should users wish for more pro­tec­tion in crowded places, she added.</p>
    <p>They come in four sizes of small, medium, large and ex­tra large, with the small in­tended for chil­dren un­der eight only. Ms Ho said peo­ple should check for a cor­rect fit be­fore col­lect­ing their masks, and those who fall in be­tween sizes should opt for the next big­ger size.</p>
    <p>The wa­ter-re­pel­lent masks can also be washed and reused 30 times or more.</p>
    <p>“With a proper fit, a 3D mask can sit nicely on the nose, and wraps un­der the chin, with enough room to breathe and talk with­out the mask slip­ping down our nose,” said Ms Ho.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to Proshield’s web­site, its masks are made of polyester for good breatha­bil­ity. In ad­di­tion, they have a par­ti­cle fil­tra­tion ef­fi­ciency (PFE) of 97 per cent, and bac­te­rial fil­tra­tion ef­fi­ciency (BFE) of 99.85 per cent for up to 25 washes.</p>
    <p>These mea­sures in­di­cate how much of droplets and bac­te­ria can be fil­tered.</p>
    <p>The PFE test mea­sures how well the mask can filter tiny res­pi­ra­tory droplets of 0.1 mi­cron or one mil­lionth of a me­tre.</p>
    <p>The BFE test mea­sures its abil­ity to filter droplets con­tain­ing bac­te­ria at about three mi­crons in size.</p>
    <p>A good mask should have a BFE and PFE of more than 95 per cent.</p>
    <p>The filter pads are also made out of nanofi­bre to pro­tect users from dust par­ti­cles, wa­ter droplets and bac­te­rial growth.</p>
    <p>The DET masks dis­trib­uted by Te­masek in Septem­ber had a BFE value of more than 80 per cent, but it did not have a PFE value.</p>
    <p>Both types of masks have a breatha­bil­ity read­ing equiv­a­lent to less than 40 Pas­cals per sq cm in a dif­fer­en­tial pres­sure test, in­di­cat­ing the mask is com­fort­able to wear.</p>
    <p>During Te­masek’s pre­vi­ous distributi­on ex­er­cise from Septem­ber to Oc­to­ber, around 7.6 mil­lion free re­us­able an­timi­cro­bial masks were col­lected. In its first ex­er­cise from June to July, 9.3 mil­lion masks were col­lected.</p>
    <p>More de­tails will be avail­able on staypre­pared.sg/masks</p>
    <p>SHAPED TO FIT THE FACE</p>
    <p>With a proper fit, a 3D mask can sit nicely on the nose, and wraps un­der the chin, with enough room to breathe, and talk with­out the mask slip­ping down our nose.</p>
