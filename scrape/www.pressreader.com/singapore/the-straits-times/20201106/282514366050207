    <p>Five months af­ter she de­buted her sunscreen-fo­cused skin­care la­bel in 2018, Ms Char­lotte ChenPien­aar de­cided to re­brand it.</p>
    <p>It had been do­ing fairly well in the United States, where the brand launched and was stocked in cloth­ing and life­style stores such as An­thro­polo­gie, Madewell and Re­volve – but not well enough in Ms Chen-Pien­aar’s book.</p>
    <p>“I knew the short­com­ings. I was too fo­cused on for­mula and didn’t put much thought into pack­ag­ing or pric­ing,” says the Hong Kong­born founder, who is in her 30s.</p>
    <p>“I wanted to truly cap­ture the Gen Z and mil­len­nial mar­ket.”</p>
    <p>The brand, Every­day Hu­mans, re­launched this year – with “more af­ford­able for­mu­las and eye-pop­ping, In­sta­gram pack­ag­ing” – to bring out its quirky per­son­al­ity.</p>
    <p>The re­brand clinched her deals with Amer­i­can cos­met­ics chain Ulta Beauty and Sephora Asi­aPa­cific.</p>
    <p>On the heels of K- and J-beauty, in­die brands from other parts of Asia are catch­ing the eye of beauty lovers and re­tail­ers alike. They share in com­mon trendy pack­ag­ing, so­cial me­dia savvi­ness and clean or cru­elty-free claims.</p>
    <p>Covid-19 may have had a part to play. Around the world, the pan­demic has thrown the spot­light on lo­cal play­ers, ac­cel­er­at­ing a slow but steady climb in in­ter­est in what one’s own backyard has to of­fer.</p>
    <p>For a brand, the big­gest show of sup­port is be­ing picked up by a large re­tailer. There are the Sephora suc­cess sto­ries, such as home-grown skin­care la­bels Al­lies of Skin and Skin Inc.</p>
    <p>And now Every­day Hu­mans has joined the beauty re­tail gi­ant’s sta­ble of brands, launch­ing on­line (s e p h o r a . s g / b r a n d s / e v e r y d a y - hu­mans) in Septem­ber.</p>
    <p>For the re­brand, Ms ChenPien­aar re­placed the pre­vi­ous all­white tubes with colour­ful prod­ucts that come with cheeky names like Rest­ing Beach Face SPF30 Sunscreen Serum ($39) and Oh My Bod! SPF50 Body Sunscreen ($28).</p>
    <p>The Ulta ac­count, she says, was “a pretty big deal” as brands there are pre­dom­i­nantly Amer­i­can.</p>
    <p>“I think we found an in­ter­est­ing in-be­tween, fill­ing a need for a brand with high-per­for­mance sunscreen but at an af­ford­able price, that was also eco-friendly, cru­el­tyfree and in line with what a mil­len­nial cus­tomer wants.”</p>
    <p>While Ms Chen-Pien­aar, who moved here in 2014, iden­ti­fies her brand as not be­ing pegged to ge­og­ra­phy – the prod­ucts are man­u­fac­tured in Aus­tralia and the US – she be­lieves her edge in pitch­ing to Sephora was of­fer­ing ef­fi­ca­cious for­mu­las with mil­len­nial-friendly val­ues at af­ford­able prices.</p>
    <p>“In Asia, even though you care about things like brands be­ing cru­elty-free, you may not pay for it.”</p>
    <p>Lo­cal skin­care la­bel Rooki Beauty also re­cently got the at­ten­tion of ma­jor re­tail­ers. It was se­lected to stock at Wat­sons in Au­gust, and BHG’s new Beauty Library at Bugis Junc­tion last month.</p>
    <p>Founder Hay­ley Teo, 28, who started the brand last year, says it was both sur­pris­ing and sur­real to make it to the shelves of well­known re­tail­ers so quickly.</p>
    <p>“Af­ter speak­ing with them, we re­alised that smart re­tail­ers see crises as an op­por­tu­nity to rein­vent parts of their busi­nesses. Some have been tak­ing the chance to trim the fat and re­place an­ti­quated beauty brands with newer in­die ones that are more ag­ile and at­tuned to con­sumer pref­er­ences,” she says.</p>
    <p>Sales have been steadily grow­ing, in part due to the new de­mo­graph­ics Rooki has been able to reach via BHG and Wat­sons, she adds.</p>
    <p>Wat­sons launched a “for SG by SG” ini­tia­tive in Au­gust to in­crease the vis­i­bil­ity of lo­cal health and beauty la­bels – both on­line and phys­i­cally through store pop-ups. There are cur­rently 16 lo­cal brands on the e-store.</p>
    <p>Neigh­bour­ing coun­tries have in re­cent years also proven to be a treasure trove of un­der­rated beauty finds.</p>
    <p>Last month, Filipino cult cos­met­ics brand Sun­nies Face de­lighted its fans on In­sta­gram when it an­nounced its ar­rival in Sin­ga­pore and Malaysia via e-com­merce plat­form Lazada.</p>
    <p>The brand, founded by Filipino so­ci­ety big­wigs in­clud­ing Ge­orgina Wil­son (known here for host­ing re­al­ity show Asia’s Next Top Model) in 2018, shot to fame among mil­len­ni­als in the Philip­pines, af­ter de­but­ing with a sin­gle matte lip­stick.</p>
    <p>It gained global ac­claim af­ter be­ing fea­tured on the pages of beauty bibles like Al­lure Mag­a­zine – and on the lips of celebri­ties such as English model Rosie Hunt­ing­ton-Whiteley.</p>
    <p>The Sun­nies Face LazMall store in Sin­ga­pore is one of the brand’s first steps to­wards in­ter­na­tional ship­ping. It taps Lazada’s lo­gis­tics in­fra­struc­ture to fa­cil­i­tate cross­bor­der ship­ments.</p>
    <p>Af­ter start­ing as a mar­ket­place seller on Lazada Philip­pines, Sun­nies Face “sought to ex­pand its op­er­a­tions and chose Sin­ga­pore as its next des­ti­na­tion”, says Ms Geral­dine Se, cat­e­gory di­rec­tor for health and beauty at Lazada Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>“It was in­cu­bated to be­come one of the most suc­cess­ful home­grown make-up brands in Lazada Philip­pines. Through hubs in Hong Kong and Shen­zhen, with es­tab­lished ship­ping lanes to markets in South-east Asia, we pro­vide the gate­way for home-grown brands to ex­pand out­side of their lo­cal markets,” she adds.</p>
    <p>This in­fra­struc­ture has helped other re­gional beauty brands – such as ha­lal beauty line War­dah from In­done­sia and Cute Press from Thai­land, which have LazMall stores – sell to Sin­ga­pore too.</p>
    <p>This can only be good news for beauty fans.</p>
    <p>Af­ter a year of pin­ing from afar, pub­lic re­la­tions ex­ec­u­tive Sara Kim, 25, placed an or­der the day Sun­nies Face an­nounced its Lazada launch.</p>
    <p>“I found the brand through In­sta­gram and have been ob­sessed with their feed for the long­est time. When I heard they had launched on Lazada Sin­ga­pore, I was su­per ex­cited I could fi­nally pur­chase their prod­ucts, es­pe­cially the best­selling lip­sticks. I watched YouTube videos for re­views and swatches of the shades,” she says.</p>
    <p>What smaller lo­cal brands may lack in mar­ket­ing bud­get when com­pared with global brands, they make up for in qual­ity, says Rooki’s Ms Teo, who just launched the new Camelina Omega-C Bright­en­ing Fluid fa­cial oil ($90).</p>
    <p>“I’ve al­ways be­lieved that as long as you de­liver on qual­ity, Sin­ga­pore­ans are ac­tu­ally very will­ing to sup­port lo­cal. Lo­cal beauty brands are also bet­ter at cre­at­ing for­mu­las that fit lo­cal pref­er­ences and cli­mate, which con­trib­utes to a bet­ter im­pres­sion,” she says.</p>
    <p>“Launch­ing a skin­care brand is no small in­vest­ment, so it doesn’t make sense for it to skimp on qual­ity. This is why re­tail­ers are will­ing to take a chance on us.”</p>
