    <p>I have a philo­den­dron xanadu which has yel­low spots on its leaves. The plant looks gen­er­ally healthy. Please ad­vise what I should do.</p>
    <p>Ham­bali Leonardi</p>
    <p>It can be dif­fi­cult to iden­tify the causative agent from the pic­ture.</p>
    <p>The brown spots could be ei­ther scale in­sects or fun­gal spots. Try scratch­ing the spots off gen­tly with your fin­ger­nail. If they can be re­moved, they are scale in­sects. If they can­not be re­moved, they are likely fun­gal spots which arise from the plant tis­sue.</p>
    <p>For scale in­sects, you can spray a di­lute so­lu­tion of sum­mer oil or neem oil on the leaves which suf­fo­cates the pests. You may still need to re­move them gen­tly with a sponge later on.</p>
    <p>Be care­ful not to dam­age the leaves. Test the pes­ti­cide on one part of the plant to en­sure the leaves are not sen­si­tive to the pes­ti­cide.</p>
    <p>If they are fun­gal spots, the marks are per­ma­nent. The im­prove­ment of the grow­ing con­di­tions, such as by giv­ing your plant more sun­light and bet­ter air cir­cu­la­tion and pre­ven­tive ap­pli­ca­tion of a con­tact fungi­cide such as cap­tan – avail­able for sale in lo­cal nurseries – should re­duce the chances of fu­ture in­fec­tions.</p>
    <p>I bought this flow­er­ing plant two years ago. It flow­ered only once and grew to en­tan­gle the nearby rail­ing and be­came weak, with leaves drop­ping. I pruned it, but now it hardly grows. How can I get it to bloom and grow healthily again?</p>
    <p>Ernie Lim</p>
    <p>It ap­pears your plant is the jas­mine (Jas­minum sam­bac). It is quite sparse and lack­ing in vigour. A pos­si­ble cause is the lack of sun­light, judg­ing from the lo­ca­tion where it is now placed.</p>
    <p>Jas­mine has to be grown un­der di­rect or fil­tered sun­light for at least six hours daily. With suf­fi­cient sun­light, the plant will be able to make food and pro­duce new growth, which can even­tu­ally lead to the pro­duc­tion of flow­ers.</p>
    <p>En­sure that the plant is kept moist and not al­lowed to dry out when it is grown un­der sun­nier con­di­tions. Dry­ing out of the root zone can cause the lower leaves of a plant to turn yel­low and fall off.</p>
