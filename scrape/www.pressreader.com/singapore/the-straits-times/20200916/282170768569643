    <p>A for­mer doc­tor in­volved in the HIV Registry data leak saga is claim­ing trial to a charge of fail­ing to pro­vide a urine spec­i­men to nar­cotics of­fi­cers in re­la­tion to drug of­fences.</p>
    <p>Ap­pear­ing in court in shack­les yes­ter­day, the slightly built Ler Teck Siang, 39, rep­re­sented him­self and ar­gued that he had a valid ex­cuse not to pro­vide his urine to Cen­tral Nar­cotics Bureau (CNB) of­fi­cers since he was not given a “le­gal or­der” to do so.</p>
    <p>On the first day of the trial, the pros­e­cu­tion wit­ness, Se­nior Staff Sergeant Palan Hem­ma­malani from CNB, tes­ti­fied that Ler “out­rightly re­fused” to pro­vide a urine sam­ple when asked re­peat­edly. He also re­jected an of­fer to have water.</p>
    <p>“His re­sponse to­wards me was very hos­tile... He wasn’t co­op­er­a­tive, he wasn’t lis­ten­ing to what I was say­ing, he just re­fused,” she said. “He said that he does not wish to give his urine sam­ple, cit­ing hu­man rights and civil rights.”</p>
    <p>Ler, in cross-ex­am­in­ing Se­nior Staff Sgt Hem­ma­malani, said he men­tioned that while he was able to pro­vide a urine sam­ple, he “would rather not (give the sam­ple) if (he) did not have to”. The of­fi­cer did not re­call hav­ing this con­ver­sa­tion.</p>
    <p>Un­der the Mis­use of Drugs Act, it is an of­fence to fail to pro­vide a CNB of­fi­cer who rea­son­ably sus­pects any per­son to have com­mit­ted a drug-re­lated of­fence with a sam­ple of their urine with­out a rea­son­able ex­cuse.</p>
    <p>Last Oc­to­ber, Ler was sen­tenced to 15 months’ jail for in­ject­ing drug abusers for a fee, and pos­sess­ing drug uten­sils after he was ar­rested with drug abuser Sim Eng Chee at</p>
    <p>Con­rad Cen­ten­nial Ho­tel on March 2, 2018. Ho­tel staff called the au­thor­i­ties after they found drugs in Sim’s ho­tel room.</p>
    <p>Deputy pub­lic pros­e­cu­tors Dwayne Lum and Lu Yi­wei brought out eight CNB of­fi­cers yes­ter­day who were in­volved in the case.</p>
    <p>Sev­eral of­fi­cers tes­ti­fied that Ler ini­tially re­fused to be searched at the ho­tel, say­ing that he had “hu­man” and “civil rights”.</p>
    <p>How­ever, after drugs were found in Sim’s bag, Ler was hand­cuffed and searched. Straws and a sy­ringe were found on him.</p>
    <p>A re­in­force­ment team was called to pick Ler up from the ho­tel and process him at the CNB of­fice in New Bridge Road where he is ac­cused of not pro­vid­ing a spec­i­men of his urine to CNB of­fi­cers.</p>
    <p>The three-day trial con­tin­ues to­day with Ler tak­ing the stand.</p>
    <p>Ler is serv­ing a two-year sen­tence for help­ing his HIV-pos­i­tive for­mer part­ner, Amer­i­can Mikhy Far­reraBroche­z, cheat the au­thor­i­ties into is­su­ing him a work pass in 2008.</p>
    <p>In the HIV registry scan­dal last year, the de­tails of 14,200 HIV-pos­i­tive pa­tients were leaked online.</p>
    <p>Ler, who was for­merly head of the Na­tional Pub­lic Health Unit, also faces a charge un­der the Of­fi­cial Se­crets Act.</p>
