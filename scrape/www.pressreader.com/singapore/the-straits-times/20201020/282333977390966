    <p>BAD DE­FEND­ING IS GREAT TO WATCH</p>
    <p>There have still been no goal­less draws this sea­son and a quar­ter of the 48 Pre­mier League games so far have fea­tured six or more goals.</p>
    <p>While the glut makes for great en­ter­tain­ment for those watch­ing at home, par­tic­u­larly as fans re­main banned from sta­di­ums, West Ham manager David Moyes is keen to see a re­turn to some de­cent de­fend­ing to go along with the drama.</p>
    <p>While the Scot ad­mit­ted it was ex­cit­ing to see end-toend ac­tion, he is still a purist at heart, claim­ing that the crazy score­lines were sim­ply down to “lack of good de­fend­ing” af­ter his side’s 3-3 draw at Tot­ten­ham.</p>
    <p>KEPA NOT THE ONLY CHELSEA FALL GUY</p>
    <p>Kepa Ar­riz­a­bal­aga had another af­ter­noon to for­get in goal as his howler al­lowed Che Adams to score Southamp­ton’s se­cond in the 3-3 draw at Stam­ford Bridge.</p>
    <p>The Spa­niard has al­ready lost his place to Willy Ca­ballero and Edouard Mendy this sea­son, but re­turned due to an in­jury suf­fered by the lat­ter on in­ter­na­tional duty.</p>
    <p>How­ever, he should not be the only scape­goat at Chelsea as manager Frank Lam­pard must take re­spon­si­bil­ity for their leak­i­ness at the back.</p>
    <p>Kepa was not in goal when they con­ceded three times to West Brom last month and Chelsea have now let in 63 goals in 43 league games un­der Lam­pard.</p>
