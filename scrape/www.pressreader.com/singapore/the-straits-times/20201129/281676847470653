    <p>Cadet pi­lot Ja­son Koor’s fly­ing am­bi­tions may have been put on hold for the next few years due to the coro­n­avirus out­break, but the 26-year-old is us­ing this down­time to in­spire the next gen­er­a­tion of avi­a­tors.</p>
    <p>Mr Koor, along with two friends, in­cor­po­rated avi­a­tion en­rich­ment com­pany Air­cademy last month. It hopes to help youth who are keen in the avi­a­tion in­dus­try to learn more, through cour­ses that will teach them about planes and avi­a­tion-re­lated work, like ground han­dling. In­dus­try play­ers such as pi­lots will be in­vited to share their ex­pe­ri­ences with par­tic­i­pants.</p>
    <p>The co-founders hope to be able to stretch the $30,000 they put in to get the busi­ness off the ground, as they have man­aged to get dis­counts on costs such as rent. They will run a trial pro­gramme next month – dur­ing the school hol­i­days – to test their cur­ricu­lum and study the fea­si­bil­ity and vi­a­bil­ity of the busi­ness, said Mr Koor, who grad­u­ated from the Na­tional Univer­sity of Sin­ga­pore last year with a dou­ble de­gree in civil en­gi­neer­ing and man­age­ment.</p>
    <p>The trio hope to help nur­ture an in­ter­est in avi­a­tion through means which they feel were not as ac­ces­si­ble to youth when they them­selves were younger.</p>
    <p>Mr Koor, whose now-sus­pended pi­lot train­ing with a lo­cal air­line was due to be com­pleted next year, said Air­cademy hopes to es­tab­lish a knowl­edge ecosys­tem through the qual­ity of its syl­labus and word of mouth. Pro­vid­ing ac­cess to avi­a­tion knowl­edge and in­for­ma­tion is their top pri­or­ity, he added.</p>
    <p>“I want to work with phi­lan­thropists and get kids who are from the lower-in­come group to join the classes – so long as they have the pas­sion and ap­ti­tude – so that they can get a head start as well,” he said. “Peo­ple tend to think en­rich­ment cour­ses in Sin­ga­pore are only for those who can re­ally af­ford it, but we want to cre­ate the op­por­tu­nity for ac­ces­si­bil­ity,”</p>
    <p>The start-up’s ob­jec­tives are ed­u­ca­tion first and busi­ness sec­ond, said Mr Koor, as the co-founders’ fo­cus is on con­tribut­ing to an in­dus­try they are pas­sion­ate about.</p>
    <p>“I’ve de­cided that if I want to in­vest my time in this in­dus­try as a ca­reer, I might as well make the most of th­ese two, three years...and de­velop my­self in this in­dus­try.”</p>
