    <p>We thank Mr Kevin Tan for his views (Re­duc­tion in ComCare aid a bur­den to re­cip­i­ents, ST On­line, Nov 17).</p>
    <p>ComCare Short-to-Medium-Term As­sis­tance (SMTA) sup­ports low-in­come house­holds re­quir­ing help with ba­sic liv­ing ex­penses. Other than cash as­sis­tance and as­sis­tance with med­i­cal ex­penses, ComCare house­holds on the SMTA scheme may re­ceive as­sis­tance with their house­hold bills, in­clud­ing rental, util­i­ties, and ser­vice and con­ser­vancy charges.</p>
    <p>The Min­istry of So­cial and Fam­ily De­vel­op­ment’s (MSF) so­cial ser­vice of­fices (SSOs) also con­nect ComCare house­holds to rel­e­vant ser­vices and sup­port by gov­ern­ment agen­cies and com­mu­nity part­ners, such as em­ploy­ment as­sis­tance and as­sis­tance from fam­ily ser­vice cen­tres.</p>
    <p>ComCare house­holds ben­e­fit from other Covid-re­lated gov­ern­ment</p>
    <p>Bud­get sup­port schemes that are dis­bursed to all Sin­ga­pore­ans, such as the Care and Sup­port Pack­age and Sol­i­dar­ity Pay­ment. These are on top of the ComCare as­sis­tance they cur­rently re­ceive.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing this Covid-19 sit­u­a­tion, MSF has au­to­mat­i­cally ex­tended ComCare as­sis­tance by six months for some 12,000 house­holds whose as­sis­tance was due to end be­tween May and Oc­to­ber this year, so that they do not need to reap­ply for as­sis­tance. New ComCare ben­e­fi­cia­ries gen­er­ally re­ceive at least six months of sup­port which pro­vide them with a longer run­way to sta­bilise their fi­nan­cial cir­cum­stances.</p>
    <p>As ComCare ben­e­fi­cia­ries al­ready re­ceive com­pre­hen­sive and tai­lored sup­port, their ComCare as­sis­tance quan­tum will be ad­justed if they also re­ceive other gov­ern­ment as­sis­tance that sim­i­larly sup­ports their ba­sic liv­ing ex­penses. This is to re­duce du­pli­ca­tion in gov­ern­ment as­sis­tance and will en­able us to chan­nel these re­sources to help those with greater needs.</p>
    <p>ComCare house­holds that re­ceive pay­outs from the Self-Em­ployed Per­son In­come Re­lief Scheme</p>
    <p>(Sirs) will have their ComCare cash as­sis­tance re­viewed for the pe­riod of Sirs as­sis­tance, tak­ing into con­sid­er­a­tion the fam­ily’s fi­nan­cial cir­cum­stances and the monies re­ceived from Sirs. These ComCare house­holds will con­tinue to re­ceive help with their med­i­cal ex­penses at pub­lic health­care in­sti­tu­tions. We may also as­sist with their house­hold bills.</p>
    <p>ComCare house­holds that face changes in their fi­nan­cial cir­cum­stances can ap­proach our SSOs to have their ComCare as­sis­tance re­viewed. The SSO will as­sess their new cir­cum­stances and ad­just their ComCare sup­port as needed.</p>
