    <p>GEARED TO­WARDS THE FU­TURE</p>
    <p>The next-gen­er­a­tion gam­ing con­sole war sport­ing more life-like graph­ics has of­fi­cially ar­rived, with Sony’s PlaySta­tion 5 (PS5) set to go head to head with Mi­crosoft’s Xbox Se­ries X and Se­ries S in Novem­ber.</p>
    <p>Sony an­nounced the price and re­lease date for its PS5 in a live stream yes­ter­day morn­ing, end­ing months of spec­u­la­tion.</p>
    <p>The stan­dard PS5 will cost $729, while the dig­i­tal edi­tion, which comes with­out a Blu-ray disc drive, will cost $599.</p>
    <p>Both ver­sions will launch first on Nov 12 in seven coun­tries in­clud­ing the United States and Ja­pan, and on Nov 19 for the rest of the world, in­clud­ing Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>Con­sumers in Sin­ga­pore will be able to pre-or­der the gad­get from to­day, both on­line and in-per­son at elec­tron­ics and gam­ing stores such as Courts and Toy or Game.</p>
    <p>The dig­i­tal edi­tion of the PS5 is Sony’s first PlaySta­tion to launch with­out a disc drive.</p>
    <p>“We feel that we’re giv­ing gamers who buy the PS5 a con­sole that is fu­ture-proof and will (still) be rel­e­vant in two to three years,” said Sony In­ter­ac­tive En­ter­tain­ment chief Jim Ryan in an in­ter­view ex­clu­sive to The Straits Times in South­east Asia.</p>
    <p>“Based on the most re­cent data that we pub­lished (in Au­gust), more than two-thirds of PlaySta­tion games were pur­chased dig­i­tally, so that trend is un­de­ni­able.”</p>
    <p>Sony’s dig­i­tal soft­ware sales from</p>
    <p>April to June amid the on­go­ing Covid-19 pan­demic rose 83 per cent, com­pared with the same pe­riod last year.</p>
    <p>But the pan­demic also com­pli­cated Sony’s pro­duc­tion and launch plans for the PS5, said Mr Ryan.</p>
    <p>“Ev­ery­thing just went ab­so­lutely crazy when Covid-19 hit. In March or April, we were won­der­ing if we would be able to have a launch at all,” he said.</p>
    <p>“And then af­ter that we started to think about the de­mand sit­u­a­tion, and whether any­one would be able to go out­doors to buy a PS5 and whether there would be any stores open to sell them.”</p>
    <p>Sony denied on Tues­day that it had run into man­u­fac­tur­ing prob­lems for the PS5, fol­low­ing a Bloomberg re­port that said the com­pany was plan­ning to re­duce its launch pro­duc­tion by four mil­lion units. It ini­tially planned to pro­duce 10 mil­lion units by the end of this year.</p>
    <p>The Ja­panese elec­tron­ics gi­ant had been widely ex­pected to re­veal the PS5 price and launch dates in re­sponse to its ri­val Mi­crosoft do­ing the same for its Xbox Se­ries X and Se­ries S last week.</p>
    <p>The Xbox Se­ries X is marginally cheaper than the PS5 at $699, while the less pow­er­ful Se­ries S costs $459. Both are launch­ing on Nov 10.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day’s live stream also fur­ther fleshed out the line-up of games that con­sumers can ex­pect for the PS5, in­clud­ing a range of con­sole ex­clu­sives.</p>
    <p>New in­stal­ments of the pop­u­lar Fi­nal Fan­tasy and God Of War fran­chises will be con­sole ex­clu­sives for the PS5, with the lat­ter ex­pected to be re­leased next year.</p>
    <p>Fans also got an ex­tended look at game­play for Spi­der-Man: Miles Mo­rales, which will launch along­side the PS5, and a new Harry Pot­ter-themed ti­tle called Hog­warts Legacy that will be out next year.</p>
    <p>A con­sole that is priced higher than its com­peti­tor will al­ways be a tough sell, but ex­clu­sive games are equally im­por­tant for con­sumers, said Mr Daniel Ah­mad, a se­nior an­a­lyst at gam­ing mar­ket re­searchers Niko Part­ners.</p>
    <p>“We ex­pect Sony to win out in the con­sole space,” he added.</p>
    <p>“Sony has not just en­sured that cur­rent PS4 own­ers will be able to smoothly tran­si­tion over to the PS5, but also... (of­fered) a way for new PS5 users to have a ro­bust games li­brary on Day 1.”</p>
    <p>We feel we’re giv­ing gamers who buy the PS5 a con­sole that is fu­ture-proof and will (still) be rel­e­vant in two to three years.</p>
    <p>MR JIM RYAN, chief of Sony In­ter­ac­tive En­ter­tain­ment.</p>
