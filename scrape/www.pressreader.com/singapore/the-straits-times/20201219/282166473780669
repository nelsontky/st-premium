    <p>Co-founder of so­cial en­ter­prise TreeDots</p>
    <p>A stu­dent ex­change trip to Ger­many in 2016 awak­ened Mr Lau Jia Cai’s en­vi­ron­men­tal con­science. He was sur­prised to see that su­per­mar­kets marked down un­sold in­ven­tory and prod­ucts nearer their ex­piry date – a prac­tice not as com­mon in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>A year later, back here, he and two friends set up TreeDots, a so­cial en­ter­prise which aims to re­duce food wastage by get­ting whole­salers and sup­pli­ers to sell un­sold prod­ucts to F&B busi­nesses at dis­counted prices of up to 30 per cent. With its app, con­sumers can also buy food at good dis­counts.</p>
    <p>The three founders – who were pre­vi­ously in the fi­nance field – could fi­nally pay them­selves a salary last year, and TreeDots this year turned prof­itable enough for the team to grow from three to 60 peo­ple.</p>
    <p>Mr Lau said he is look­ing for­ward to ex­pand­ing op­er­a­tions into Malaysia next year, as well as the rest of South-east Asia, where cost sav­ings could mean more to peo­ple and where a big­ger im­pact could be had.</p>
    <p>A cor­po­rate lawyer by day, Mr Daryl Yang is among the most out­spo­ken of his gen­er­a­tion on hu­man rights and po­lit­i­cal ed­u­ca­tion.</p>
    <p>When he was still a stu­dent at the Na­tional Univer­sity of Sin­ga­pore, he co-founded the stu­dent-run Com­mu­nity for Ad­vo­cacy and Po­lit­i­cal Ed­u­ca­tion, which this year pro­duced online re­sources to help peo­ple make sense of their vote dur­ing the gen­eral elec­tion.</p>
    <p>He also cham­pi­ons les­bian, gay, bi­sex­ual, trans­gen­der (LGBT) rights, this year work­ing with LGBT groups to co-au­thor a re­port on the state of hu­man rights in Sin­ga­pore, which was sub­mit­ted to the United Na­tions Hu­man Rights Coun­cil in Oc­to­ber.</p>
    <p>He said his ex­pe­ri­ence with ac­tivism has taught him that change takes time. “We need to con­tinue speaking up and cam­paign­ing, even if the im­pact might not be im­me­di­ate... to shape a bet­ter fu­ture, if not for us, then for oth­ers to come.”</p>
    <p>IRIE AMAN, 23</p>
    <p>When Ms Irie Aman first spoke up on the sen­si­tive topic of queer Mus­lim is­sues, she faced back­lash and even in­ci­dents of stalk­ing by hos­tile strangers.</p>
    <p>The ed­i­tor-in-chief of in­de­pen­dent magazine The Lo­cal Rebel, which gives voice to in­ter­sec­tional fem­i­nist is­sues, said she was an­gry at the state of the world.</p>
    <p>“I saw so much that could be bet­ter and wanted to be a part of the so­lu­tion. I’m ex­cited by the po­ten­tial of com­mu­ni­ties to come to­gether to de­mand bet­ter.” she said.</p>
    <p>In­ter­sec­tional fem­i­nism ex­plores is­sues faced by women of colour, or those who have a dif­fer­ent sex­ual ori­en­ta­tion, for in­stance.</p>
    <p>Ms Aman is now wait­ing for Covid-19 re­stric­tions to ease so that she can hold work­shops for queer Mus­lims to un­der­stand how spir­i­tu­al­ity and sex­u­al­ity go to­gether.</p>
