    <p>Face masks have helped curb in­fec­tions and have made ev­ery­day life safer as coro­n­avirus cases surge world­wide. But the bil­lions of masks that are used daily across the globe are</p>
    <p>cre­at­ing a grow­ing en­vi­ron­men­tal prob­lem that could last much longer than the pan­demic. Dis­pos­able masks are made from plas­tics, which can take decades to break down. In ad­di­tion to masks, the pan­demic has also led to a surge in other plas­tic waste.</p>
    <p>SYD­NEY In the early days of the Covid-19 pan­demic, the health au­thor­i­ties turned to the two most read­ily avail­able prod­ucts to pre­vent air­borne con­trac­tion – sur­gi­cal and N95 masks.</p>
    <p>But both are typ­i­cally in­tended for sin­gle use only and were not de­signed to min­imise waste or al­low for re­cy­cling.</p>
    <p>As the pan­demic stretched on, and it be­came clear that much of the planet’s pop­u­la­tion was go­ing to need to wear masks, a search be­gan for more vi­able op­tions that would min­imise the en­vi­ron­men­tal dam­age.</p>
    <p>This has led to the cre­ation of biodegrad­able masks from nat­u­ral sub­stances such as hemp, sugar cane and leaves.</p>
    <p>Re­searchers have also been look­ing to de­velop masks whose var­i­ous com­po­nents can be re­cy­cled.</p>
    <p>Dr Mayuri Wi­jaya­sun­dara from Deakin Univer­sity in Aus­tralia, an ex­pert on sus­tain­able prod­uct de­sign, said there was still no per­fect so­lu­tion to ad­dress the waste prob­lem.</p>
    <p>She said pro­duc­ing re­cy­clable masks would re­quire de­signs that al­low the com­po­nents to be sep­a­rated.</p>
    <p>For in­stance, with the tight-fit­ting, highly pro­tec­tive N95 mask typ­i­cally worn by health­care work­ers, this would in­volve al­low­ing easy sep­a­ra­tion of parts such as the straps, fil­ter and valve, staples and nose clip. The risk of con­ta­gion, how­ever, may dis­cour­age peo­ple or hos­pi­tals from re­cy­cling.</p>
    <p>“With the pan­demic com­ing un­ex­pect­edly, there was a need at the be­gin­ning for face masks and there was no pre­pared­ness for de­sign­ing the right one,” Dr Wi­jaya­sun­dara told The Straits Times.</p>
    <p>She added that cloth masks, which can be washed and re­worn, pro­vide a good op­tion for per­sonal use, but do not of­fer op­ti­mal pro­tec­tion.</p>
    <p>“If you are us­ing a sin­gle-use item, one strong op­tion is to use a prod­uct that can go back to na­ture, es­pe­cially with the case of Covid-19, as there are fears associated with han­dling dur­ing re­cy­cling,” she said.</p>
    <p>“The other op­tion is to de­sign</p>
    <p>for re­use of most parts... Fil­ters may have lim­ited op­tions for treat­ment at the end of life, but the rest could be de­signed for re­use and di­verted for re­cy­cling at the end of life, if (the mask) is de­signed that way.”</p>
    <p>Sev­eral firms around the world have been pro­duc­ing masks from biodegrad­able ma­te­rial, though many of these still have lim­ited out­put.</p>
    <p>These masks should typ­i­cally be dis­posed of in nor­mal waste.</p>
    <p>A Filipino pro­ducer, Salay Hand­made Prod­ucts In­dus­tries, has be­gun mak­ing masks out of the abaca plant, which is sim­i­lar to the ba­nana plant. The fi­bres are strong and can de­com­pose within two months.</p>
    <p>In France, the firm Geochan­vre has been pro­duc­ing masks made mostly from hemp, with a re­cy­clable elas­tic band. The masks cost €34 (S$55) for a pack of 50.</p>
    <p>As at Septem­ber, the firm had sold 1.5 mil­lion masks.</p>
    <p>In Aus­tralia, the Queens­land Univer­sity of Tech­nol­ogy has been de­vel­op­ing a mask made from agri­cul­tural waste such as sugar cane mulch.</p>
    <p>An ex­pert on sus­tain­able prod­uct de­sign, Dr Ke­iron Roberts from Bri­tain’s Univer­sity of Portsmouth, said the best mask op­tion was to use a multi-lay­ered re­us­able face mask. He said peo­ple should not try to re­cy­cle their masks but should in­stead try to min­imise the en­vi­ron­men­tal dam­age by putting all masks in the bin and cut­ting straps to pre­vent any an­i­mals get­ting en­tan­gled if the waste spills.</p>
    <p>“There are some com­pa­nies of­fer­ing re­cy­cling of PPE (per­sonal pro­tec­tive equip­ment), but (such re­cy­cling) is not widely used, and of­ten not avail­able to the gen­eral public,” he told ST.</p>
    <p>“You shouldn’t cur­rently re­cy­cle your mask, as there is no in­fra­struc­ture widely in place to han­dle the waste, and it can tangle in the equip­ment used and be a po­ten­tial Covid-19 con­tam­i­na­tion source for work­ers.”</p>
    <p>He added: “This is a new form of lit­ter for most coun­tries, with a re­ally sim­ple so­lu­tion: Just bin the mask.”</p>
