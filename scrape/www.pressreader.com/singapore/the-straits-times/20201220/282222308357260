    <p>Who would have thought that tem­per­a­ture screen­ers and safe dis­tanc­ing am­bas­sadors would be peo­ple one now en­coun­ters daily at malls, food out­lets and su­per­mar­kets?</p>
    <p>Be­fore 2020, job ti­tles such as con­tact trac­ing am­bas­sadors and swab­bers might have sounded odd, but they have be­come fa­mil­iar in the fight against Covid-19.</p>
    <p>On the front line of this bat­tle are the red-shirted safe dis­tanc­ing am­bas­sadors, who prowl the neigh­bour­hood malls and high­traf­fic ar­eas like Or­chard Road and at­trac­tions such as Gar­dens by the Bay and Sen­tosa’s Palawan Beach.</p>
    <p>Their job in­volves en­sur­ing peo­ple main­tain safe dis­tanc­ing in queues and re­mind­ing them to wear masks in public places.</p>
    <p>In Au­gust, one such am­bas­sador told The Straits Times: “I like be­ing able to con­trib­ute and we also get to ex­er­cise while we are walk­ing. Many peo­ple also come and thank us.”</p>
    <p>Swab­bers and swab as­sis­tants are hired on short-term con­tracts, with swab­bers paid $3,800 a month, ac­cord­ing to news re­ports.</p>
    <p>A swab­ber typ­i­cally dons per­sonal pro­tec­tive equip­ment and per­forms swab op­er­a­tions and in­fec­tion con­trol, as well as other ad-hoc du­ties.</p>
    <p>One swab­ber told ST in June that he had been re­trenched from his pre­vi­ous com­pany and de­cided to take up a six-month con­tract as he was cu­ri­ous about the swab­bing job and wanted to con­trib­ute to the fight against Covid-19.</p>
