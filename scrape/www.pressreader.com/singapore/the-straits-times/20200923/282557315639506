    <p>LOS AN­GE­LES The cre­ators of big Emmy win­ner Watch­men, a timely blend of su­per­heroes and po­lit­i­cal satire that con­fronts racism in the United States, say they are proud to have spot­lighted the na­tion’s his­toric trau­mas and modern-day in­jus­tices – as fans hope for a pos­si­ble fol­low-up.</p>
    <p>The HBO hit series, based on a sem­i­nal 1980s graphic novel, scooped up 11 Em­mys at this year’s tele­vi­sion equiv­a­lent of the Os­cars, mak­ing it Sun­day’s top hon­ouree.</p>
    <p>The show opens with the 1921 Tulsa race mas­sacre, in which up to 300 peo­ple were killed when white mobs torched a black neigh­bour­hood, but which many Amer­i­cans have never heard of.</p>
    <p>“When the show pre­miered back in Oc­to­ber, that night the word ‘Watch­men’ was not trend­ing on Twit­ter, but ‘Black Wall Street’ and ‘Tulsa mas­sacre’ were,” cre­ator Da­mon Lin­de­lof told jour­nal­ists af­ter his Emmy wins.</p>
    <p>“And it just showed you that peo­ple ac­tu­ally have a real hunger to find these miss­ing pieces of his­tory. You just have to find ways that are a lit­tle bit off the beaten path to tell them.”</p>
    <p>The show is set in an al­ter­nate time­line cre­ated by Alan Moore and Dave Gib­bons in their Watch­men comics.</p>
    <p>In this uni­verse, su­per­heroes are real, but many have turned out to be so­cio­pathic far-right out­laws.</p>
    <p>Fea­tur­ing on Time mag­a­zine’s list of the 100 best modern English­language nov­els, the orig­i­nal book is widely hailed for bring­ing main­stream pop­u­lar­ity and artis­tic cred­i­bil­ity to the graphic novel form.</p>
    <p>Race plays a cen­tral role through­out, not just in the pi­lot episode’s por­trayal of the deadly de­struc­tion of “Black Wall Street” in Ok­la­homa.</p>
    <p>One re­mark­able episode sees a young black New York cop strug­gle with bla­tant racism, sur­viv­ing a</p>
    <p>near-lynch­ing and con­fronting a se­cret Ku Klux Klan-style so­ci­ety op­er­at­ing within the me­trop­o­lis’ po­lice ranks.</p>
    <p>The noirish 1930s flash­back episode shot in black and white won cin­e­matog­ra­phy, writ­ing, sound edit­ing and sound mix­ing prizes at this year’s Em­mys.</p>
    <p>Watch­men de­picts white suprem</p>
    <p>acists, po­lice bru­tal­ity and rows over mask-wear­ing – all sub­jects of in­tensely po­larised de­bate in the US as the coun­try gears up for Novem­ber’s pres­i­den­tial elec­tion.</p>
    <p>In the show’s present-day scenes, repa­ra­tions paid to the fam­i­lies of Tulsa mas­sacre vic­tims have gal­vanised a white su­prem­a­cist group, which is fu­ri­ous at the gov­ern­ment’s sup­port for mi­nori­ties and bent on trig­ger­ing a race war.</p>
    <p>The show’s Emmy wins came in the in­creas­ingly pres­ti­gious lim­ited series cat­e­gory, which is in­tended for stand­alone minis­eries.</p>
    <p>But a se­quel of sorts has not been cat­e­gor­i­cally ruled out.</p>
    <p>Mr Lin­de­lof said on Sun­day that he “in­vited any other artist who wants to take the ba­ton – I’ll teach them ev­ery­thing that I know”.</p>
    <p>The showrun­ner added that he per­son­ally found it “so much more spe­cial” to end af­ter nine episodes, and that he was “so much more ex­cited about see­ing what some­one else does with it”.</p>
    <p>Not­ing that “some­one else cre­ated” the orig­i­nal Watch­men, he added: “It would feel like a huge be­trayal of win­ning lim­ited series to come back and say, well, it was only lim­ited series dot dot dot...”</p>
    <p>Asked about her own pos­si­ble in­volve­ment in a fol­low-up, Regina King, who clinched Out­stand­ing Lead Ac­tress in a Lim­ited Series for her role as a po­lice­woman, said there “have been no con­ver­sa­tions” – but that she would want to jump in if Mr Lin­de­lof re­turned.</p>
    <p>“We’re com­ing to a close of this chap­ter of the Watch­men series, as it is now,” she said.</p>
    <p>“And it is bit­ter­sweet, it’s emo­tional and I’m just try­ing to re­main in the mo­ment.”</p>
