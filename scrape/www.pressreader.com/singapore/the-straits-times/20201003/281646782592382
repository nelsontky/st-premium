    <p>Pres­i­dent Hal­imah Ya­cob, Prime Min­is­ter Lee Hsien Loong, Deputy Prime Min­is­ter Heng Swee Keat and For­eign Min­is­ter Vi­vian Balakrishn­an have ex­changed con­grat­u­la­tory mes­sages with their Chi­nese coun­ter­parts on the oc­ca­sion of the 30th an­niver­sary of the es­tab­lish­ment of diplo­matic re­la­tions be­tween the two coun­tries to­day.</p>
    <p>The lead­ers’ letters were re­leased by Sin­ga­pore’s Min­istry of For­eign Af­fairs.</p>
    <p>In her let­ter to Chi­nese Pres­i­dent Xi Jin­ping, Pres­i­dent Hal­imah noted that the foun­da­tions of the re­la­tion­ship were laid decades ago, start­ing with found­ing prime min­is­ter Lee Kuan Yew and Chi­nese leader Deng Xiaop­ing’s vis­its to each other’s coun­tries in the 1970s. Diplo­matic ties were es­tab­lished on Oct 3, 1990.</p>
    <p>Over the past 30 years, the re­la­tions be­tween Sin­ga­pore and China have flour­ished, marked by close peo­ple-to-peo­ple ties and sub­stan­tive co­op­er­a­tion, she wrote. Bi­lat­eral co­op­er­a­tion has ex­panded into new ar­eas, in­clud­ing smart cities, fi­nance, le­gal and ju­di­cial is­sues, as well as the Belt and Road Ini­tia­tive.</p>
    <p>“I am heart­ened that even amidst the chal­lenges brought about by the Covid-19 pan­demic this year, Sin­ga­pore and China have main­tained close and fre­quent ex­changes at all lev­els, and ex­tended as­sis­tance to each other in times of need,” she wrote, say­ing they have opened up new ar­eas of co­op­er­a­tion as they grap­ple with sim­i­lar chal­lenges of eco­nomic re­cov­ery and bol­ster­ing trade and con­nec­tiv­ity.</p>
    <p>In his let­ter to Chi­nese Premier Li Ke­qiang, PM Lee wrote that the long­stand­ing bi­lat­eral re­la­tion­ship pre­dates the for­mal es­tab­lish­ment of diplo­matic ties in 1990, and bi­lat­eral co­op­er­a­tion has since grown in depth and scope. He noted that China has been Sin­ga­pore’s largest trad­ing part­ner and Sin­ga­pore has been China’s largest for­eign in­vestor since 2013, and the three gov­ern­ment-to-gov­ern­ment projects in China in each of the last three decades – in Suzhou, Tian­jin and Chongqing – con­tinue to do well to­day.</p>
    <p>He added that peo­ple-to-peo­ple ex­changes have also grown, with more than four mil­lion peo­ple trav­el­ling be­tween both coun­tries in 2018, 40 times the 100,000 trav­ellers in 1990. Both coun­tries have sup­ported each other through the Covid-19 out­break, and iden­ti­fied new ar­eas of co­op­er­a­tion to pro­pel the re­la­tion­ship for­ward, he wrote.</p>
    <p>PM Lee added that both coun­tries share a strong in­ter­est in en­hanc­ing Asean-China re­la­tions, and up­hold­ing free and open trade. “I look for­ward to work­ing with you to strengthen the mul­ti­lat­eral in­fras­truc­ture that binds our world to­day, and to bring our bi­lat­eral part­ner­ship to greater heights.”</p>
    <p>Writ­ing to Vice-Premier Han Zheng, DPM Heng said Sin­ga­pore and China en­joy a multi-faceted and mu­tu­ally ben­e­fi­cial re­la­tion­ship to­day, un­der­pinned by close co­op­er­a­tion across many do­mains.</p>
    <p>Bi­lat­eral ex­changes have been in­sti­tu­tion­alised, with the Joint Coun­cil for Bi­lat­eral Co­op­er­a­tion (JCBC) as the apex plat­form, an im­por­tant one to re­view ex­ist­ing ar­eas of co­op­er­a­tion and de­velop new ar­eas to keep up with the times. The Sin­ga­pore-China Fo­rum on Lead­er­ship, the Sin­ga­pore-China So­cial Gov­er­nance Fo­rum and eight Pro­vin­cial Business Coun­cils cover other key ar­eas of co­op­er­a­tion.</p>
    <p>DPM Heng, who is also Co­or­di­nat­ing Min­is­ter for Eco­nomic Poli­cies and Fi­nance Min­is­ter, said: “Through these plat­forms, we have also built per­sonal re­la­tion­ships that fur­ther deepen our bi­lat­eral ties. My ex­changes with you, in­clud­ing our two tele­phone con­ver­sa­tions amidst the Covid-19 pan­demic this year, bear tes­ta­ment to the grow­ing re­la­tion­ship be­tween us and be­tween our coun­tries.”</p>
    <p>He looks for­ward to host­ing Mr Han and his del­e­ga­tion for the up­com­ing JCBC this year, and to dis­cuss how they can take re­la­tions to greater heights.</p>
    <p>For­eign Min­is­ter Balakrishn­an, writ­ing to his Chi­nese coun­ter­part Wang Yi, said both coun­tries have been com­mit­ted to fa­cil­i­tat­ing eco­nomic re­cov­ery by cham­pi­oning co­op­er­a­tion in cross-bor­der and sup­ply chain con­nec­tiv­ity, and have found new ar­eas of co­op­er­a­tion in pub­lic health man­age­ment and vac­cine re­search and de­vel­op­ment.</p>
    <p>“As we look back on the achieve­ments in our re­la­tions over the short span of 30 years, I am con­fi­dent that our ties will be­come even stronger as we em­bark on the next phase of our part­ner­ship,” he said.</p>
