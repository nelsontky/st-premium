    <p>WASH­ING­TON • Fac­ing ques­tions about its use of the slo­gan, “We are the storm”, a ral­ly­ing cry for QAnon ad­her­ents, the Texas Repub­li­can Party is de­fend­ing its adop­tion of the lan­guage, say­ing it was drawn from a poem and had noth­ing to do with the In­ter­net-driven con­spir­acy the­ory that claims Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump was elected to save Amer­ica from pae­dophile sa­tanists.</p>
    <p>The state party was re­spond­ing to a re­port in The New York Times last Thurs­day about how a small but grow­ing num­ber of Repub­li­cans na­tion­wide have sig­nalled sup­port for QAnon, a far-right move­ment that the Fed­eral Bureau of In­ves­ti­ga­tion has warned could in­spire do­mes­tic ter­ror­ism.</p>
    <p>The Texas Repub­li­can Party’s use of the slo­gan was cited by some prom­i­nent Repub­li­cans there as an ex­am­ple of how some in the GOP’s lead­er­ship are open­ing the party to QAnon fol­low­ers by adopt­ing lan­guage used by the move­ment.</p>
    <p>In a state­ment posted on its web­site last Fri­day af­ter the ar­ti­cle’s pub­li­ca­tion, the state party said the slo­gan came from a favourite poem of the party’s new chair­man, Mr Allen West, and that the line had bib­li­cal roots. It is “one of Chair­man West’s favourite quotes to use in speeches”, the party said. “He and the en­tire Texas GOP will not be bul­lied by par­ti­san left­ists in the me­dia into ced­ing pow­er­ful phrases with bib­li­cal roots – taken from Psalm 29 – to In­ter­net con­spir­acy groups.”</p>
    <p>Psalm 29 in­cludes a line about thun­der, but not the word “storm”.</p>
    <p>The poem in­cludes the line “I am the storm”. Its ori­gins are un­clear; it ap­peared on an In­sta­gram post in 2018 by Tom Brady, then the New Eng­land Pa­tri­ots quar­ter­back, and can be found on a web­site about scrip­ture and cul­ture.</p>
    <p>Nei­ther party of­fi­cials nor Mr West re­sponded to a ques­tion on Satur­day about whether they be­lieved that the use of the slo­gan could be taken by QAnon sup­port­ers as a sig­nal of sup­port from Texas Repub­li­cans. In­stead, Mr West said that ques­tion­ing how the party came to use the slo­gan was “a pure ex­am­ple of the left­ist em­brace of racism”.</p>
    <p>He said in a writ­ten state­ment re­leased on Satur­day: “It’s of­fen­sive and con­de­scend­ing that white, lib­eral, pro­gres­sive so­cial­ists would ex­pect me to re­spond to their de­mand to know how long I have said some­thing. It is ob­vi­ous that as a strong, con­ser­va­tive black man, I am not al­lowed to think or speak.”</p>
