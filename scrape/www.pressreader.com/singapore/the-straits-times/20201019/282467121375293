    <p>Some­times, we go against the tide to show our­selves that we are in­deed ca­pa­ble of coun­ter­ing the prover­bial bi­o­log­i­cal clock — of­ten at our very own ex­pense. What once used to be weekly ten­nis ses­sions with the bud­dies now limps into bi-weekly brisk walks. Re­mem­ber how at the peak of your pow­ers, you could last the full 90 in a foot­ball game, and still have it in your re­serves to com­plete the warm-down af­ter? Now, a cameo from the bench would suf­fice.</p>
    <p>But age­ing does not have to be all that bad. While it cer­tainly takes some get­ting used to, and an ac­cep­tance that we can­not go on for­ever work­ing our bod­ies like we used to, there are ways to soften the blow to en­sure a seam­less pas­sage into the golden years.</p>
    <p>Here are a few.</p>
    <p>Learn some­thing new</p>
    <p>In or­der to stay sharp, keep­ing your mind en­gaged is es­sen­tial, and one way to do just that is to never stop learn­ing. Life is es­sen­tially a never-end­ing op­por­tu­nity to take on new skills, and ex­pe­ri­ences. From tak­ing up a cook­ing course, to learn­ing a new lan­guage, your new­found pock­ets of time are there to be seized upon!</p>
    <p>Em­brace sim­plic­ity</p>
    <p>Ap­pre­ci­ate the sim­ple things in life. If ever there was a time to stop and smell the flow­ers, this would be it. Shed­ding the for­mer you does not nec­es­sar­ily mean a loss. Try fo­cus­ing on the gained op­por­tu­nity to en­joy what your work life rarely al­lowed for, like spend­ing more time with your fam­ily and com­plet­ing the Net­flix cat­a­logue.</p>
    <p>Lis­ten to your body</p>
    <p>While it is only nat­u­ral that you might not be able to go power through your for­mer ex­er­cise rou­tine, you should still try to main­tain some form of an ac­tive life­style. Avoid ex­ert­ing your­self, so take it all in your stride.</p>
