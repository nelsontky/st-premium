    <p>WASH­ING­TON • The United Arab Emi­rates (UAE) is get­ting top-ofthe-line fighter jets. Morocco is win­ning recog­ni­tion for its decades-old ter­ri­to­rial claims. And Sudan is com­ing off the US ter­ror­ism black­list.</p>
    <p>The Arab na­tions are sud­denly achiev­ing long-sought goals af­ter agreeing to nor­malise ties with Is­rael, in a last-minute tri­umph for the un­ortho­dox diplo­macy of out­go­ing Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kush­ner.</p>
    <p>Mocked as a lightweigh­t, Mr Kush­ner is scor­ing his­toric break­throughs with four Arab states join­ing the so-called Abra­ham Ac­cords with Is­rael. Vet­er­ans of Mid­dle East diplo­macy agree that Mr Kush­ner moved nim­bly af­ter the UAE first sig­nalled its will­ing­ness to recog­nise Is­rael.</p>
    <p>“He had the au­thor­ity; he was smart enough to de­velop per­son­alised re­la­tions...” said Mr Den­nis Ross, who served as Mr Bill Clin­ton’s Mid­dle East en­voy.</p>
    <p>Mr Kush­ner, a fam­ily friend of Is­raeli Prime Min­is­ter Ben­jamin Netanyahu, broke decades of US norms on Mid­dle East peace­mak­ing by barely pre­tend­ing to be even­handed with the Pales­tini­ans. Mr Trump recog­nised Jerusalem as Is­rael’s cap­i­tal and gave the bless­ing of the US if Mr Netanyahu wanted to an­nex much of the West Bank.</p>
    <p>Mr Kush­ner then warned the Pales­tini­ans, who were of­fered a lim­ited state, not to “screw up an­other op­por­tu­nity”.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump gave co­me­di­ans fod­der for jokes by putting Mr Kush­ner in charge of ev­ery­thing from the Mid­dle East to painkiller ad­dic­tion, but in the Gulf, such fa­mil­ial ar­range­ments showed that he spoke for the Pres­i­dent. “In the Mid­dle East, what ne­go­tia­tors or me­di­a­tors need is un­mis­tak­able au­thor­ity,” Mr Ross said.</p>
    <p>Mr Kush­ner, who turns 40 next month, largely by­passed the State Depart­ment, lever­ag­ing in­stead on his per­sonal ties with Arab roy­alty.</p>
    <p>He had ini­tially seen Gulf Arab prom­ises of money as a way to pres­sure the Pales­tini­ans – un­suc­cess­fully – to ac­cept peace on Is­rael’s terms. But this year, UAE strong­man Sheikh Mo­hamed bin Zayed Al-Nahyan – de­scribed by for­mer pres­i­dent Barack Obama as the Gulf’s savvi­est leader – reached out to turn the dy­namic on its head.</p>
    <p>Mr Netanyahu would drop his plan for an­nex­a­tion. The UAE, in turn, would be the first Arab na­tion in over 25 years to recog­nise Is­rael – and win the right to buy stealth-ca­pa­ble US F-35s.</p>
    <p>“It was an ini­tia­tive that was re­ally driven by the Emi­ratis but the (US) ad­min­is­tra­tion... has used that tem­plate these l ast sev­eral months,” said Mr David Makovsky, who stud­ies Arab-Is­raeli re­la­tions at the Wash­ing­ton In­sti­tute for Near East Pol­icy.</p>
