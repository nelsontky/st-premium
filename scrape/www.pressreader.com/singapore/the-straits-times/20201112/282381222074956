    <p>• Man­ager Jur­gen Klopp said an emo­tional good­bye to Liver­pool’s his­toric Mel­wood train­ing ground on Tues­day as the Premier League cham­pi­ons pre­pare to move into new head­quar­ters.</p>
    <p>Mel­wood has been the Mersey­side club’s base for more than 70 years, with gen­er­a­tions of An­field play­ers hon­ing their craft on the train­ing pitches.</p>
    <p>But, un­able to de­velop the site any fur­ther, the Reds will move the first team i nto the new £50 mil­lion (S$89 mil­lion) AXA Train­ing Cen­tre in Kirkby, on the out­skirts of Liver­pool, next week.</p>
    <p>Their new 9,200 sq m train­ing base is a state-of-the-art fa­cil­ity in­clud­ing three pitches, an in­door sports hall, two gyms, a swim­ming pool, hy­drother­apy and sports re­ha­bil­i­ta­tion fa­cil­i­ties.</p>
    <p>Mel­wood was sold last year to a com­pany which will build homes on the site.</p>
    <p>Klopp and his coach­ing staff were on site to close the gates on one of foot­ball’s most fa­mous train­ing grounds.</p>
    <p>“Mixed emo­tions, re­ally mixed emo­tions. I am happy about go­ing to Kirkby and very sad about leav­ing Mel­wood, to be hon­est,” he told Liver­pool’s web­site.</p>
    <p>“So, it’s strange; I didn’t think prop­erly about it so far, but my PA (per­sonal as­sis­tant) is ob­vi­ously al­ready mov­ing all my stuff out of my of­fice, so I re­alised step-bystep that the place al­ready looks dif­fer­ent.</p>
    <p>“I will miss it, but that’s how it should be. Mel­wood was re­ally good, it was im­por­tant – an im­por­tant place in my life, so I will miss it. But Kirkby will be great.”</p>
    <p>Liver­pool had ini­tially planned to move dur­ing the pre-sea­son, only for the switch to be de­layed due to the coro­n­avirus pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Like An­field’s old “Boot Room”, Mel­wood has been an iconic part of the Liver­pool story since it was trans­formed in the 1950s by the late leg­endary boss Bill Shankly.</p>
    <p>Liver­pool cap­tain Jor­dan Hen­der­son took to Twit­ter to post sev­eral black-and-white pic­tures of him­self on his last day at Mel­wood along­side the cap­tion: “One last time...”</p>
    <p>Jamie Car­ragher, Liver­pool’s sec­ond-high­est ap­pear­ance maker (737), said on so­cial me­dia: “Mel­wood gone but not for­got­ten!”, while 2005 Cham­pi­ons League winner and for­mer cap­tain Steven Gerrard shared a one-word trib­ute on In­sta­gram, post­ing a pic­ture of the Mel­wood sign with the cap­tion: “Mem­o­ries.”</p>
    <p>For­mer Reds striker Rob­bie Fowler also posted a poem about Mel­wood, in­clud­ing the lines: “From Heigh­way to Macca and Rush through to Yeats, so many leg­ends have shone through those gates.”</p>
    <p>Mixed emo­tions, re­ally mixed emo­tions... Mel­wood was re­ally good, it was im­por­tant – an im­por­tant place in my life, so I will miss it. But Kirkby will be great.</p>
    <p>JUR­GEN KLOPP, Liver­pool man­ager.</p>
    <p>Mel­wood gone but not for­got­ten!</p>
