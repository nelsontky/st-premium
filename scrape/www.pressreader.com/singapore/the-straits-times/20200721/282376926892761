    <p>Dutch his­to­rian Rut­ger Breg­man’s new book Hu­mankind puts forth a rad­i­cal the­ory – that hu­man be­ings are fun­da­men­tally nice.</p>
    <p>It is a hope­ful no­tion that has earned him much back­lash, says the 32-year-old over Skype. “How can you ever say that when the Holo­caust hap­pened? How can you ex­plain geno­cides and wars?</p>
    <p>“The irony of writ­ing a book on hu­man good­ness is that you have to go on for hun­dreds and hun­dreds of pages about the dark chap­ters in hu­man his­tory be­cause one of the strange facts about our species is that we’re not only the friendli­est species in the an­i­mal king­dom, but we’re also the cru­ellest.”</p>
    <p>What is most fas­ci­nat­ing about this, he adds, is how th­ese two things – our friend­li­ness and our cru­elty – are in­ex­tri­ca­bly con­nected.</p>
    <p>A his­tory of hu­man kind­ness may be just the ticket for a world be­set by the coro­n­avirus pan­demic. Breg­man filled his book with ex­am­ples of crises – from the Lon­don Blitz dur­ing World War II to Hur­ri­cane Katrina in 2005.</p>
    <p>Pop­u­lar wis­dom tends to­wards what Dutch bi­ol­o­gist Frans de Waal calls “ve­neer the­ory”, which Breg­man de­fines as the “no­tion that civil­i­sa­tion is noth­ing more than a thin ve­neer that will crack at the mer­est provo­ca­tion”.</p>
    <p>What ac­tu­ally hap­pens is the op­po­site, he says.</p>
    <p>“We’ve got an ex­tra­or­di­nary amount of ev­i­dence col­lected since the 1960s, more than 700 case stud­ies, that show that af­ter nat­u­ral dis­as­ters, you get an ex­plo­sion of co­op­er­a­tion, al­tru­ism and all kinds of peo­ple work­ing to­gether... It’s very much the op­po­site of what Hol­ly­wood dis­as­ter movies tell you.”</p>
    <p>The same goes for Covid-19, adds Breg­man, who be­gan writ­ing the book in 2015. “The vast ma­jor­ity of the be­hav­iour in coun­try af­ter coun­try has been proso­cial i n na­ture, peo­ple help­ing one an­other.”</p>
    <p>Breg­man pre­vi­ously made waves with his 2016 best­seller Utopia For Re­al­ists, in which he ar­gued for uni­ver­sal ba­sic in­come, a 15-hour work week and open bor­ders.</p>
    <p>He ex­pe­ri­enced a mo­ment of on­line vi­ral­ity for his in­ter­ven­tion at the World Eco­nomic Fo­rum in Davos last year, when he lam­basted his wealthy au­di­ence for avoid­ing the topic of tax­ing the rich. “It feels like I’m at a fire­fight­ers con­fer­ence and no one’s al­lowed to speak about wa­ter,” he said then.</p>
    <p>Breg­man posited in Utopia For Re­al­ists that dur­ing a mo­ment of cri­sis, i deas that used to be dis­missed as un­rea­son­able or un­re­al­is­tic – uni­ver­sal ba­sic in­come, for in­stance – can sud­denly en­ter the main­stream. “In a cri­sis, de­ci­sions are be­ing made in days or even hours that will have con­se­quences for years, even decades.</p>
    <p>“So, every­thing de­pends, i n a mo­ment of cri­sis, on what econ­o­mist Mil­ton Fried­man once called ‘the ideas that are ly­ing around’, the work that has been done be­fore the cri­sis.”</p>
    <p>Utopia For Re­al­ists laid the ground­work for Breg­man to be­gin ques­tion­ing his own as­sump­tions about hu­man­ity – af­ter all, uni­ver­sal ba­sic in­come hinges on the faith that most peo­ple will not spend that money on drugs or sit around spong­ing off the gov­ern­ment.</p>
    <p>“I’m not say­ing peo­ple are good by na­ture or that they are an­gels,” he stresses. “What I’m try­ing to say is that what you as­sume of other peo­ple is what you get out of them.</p>
    <p>“So, if you as­sume that most peo­ple are self­ish, then you’ll start de­sign­ing your so­ci­ety in such a way – all your in­sti­tu­tions, your schools, your work­places, your democ­ra­cies – and then, you’ll get the kind of peo­ple that your the­ory pre­sup­poses.”</p>
    <p>A lot of this has to do with the sto­ries hu­mans tell one an­other, he says. A story can serve as a “no­cebo”, a neg­a­tive self-ful­fill­ing prophecy, the op­po­site of a placebo. A pow­er­ful ex­am­ple of this is Wil­liam Gold­ing’s 1954 novel Lord Of The Flies, in which a group of Bri­tish school­boys are stranded on a desert is­land and turn to sav­agery.</p>
    <p>Lord Of The Flies has such a hold on the cul­tural imag­i­na­tion that most peo­ple now as­sume it to be the in­evitable tra­jec­tory of the hu­man con­di­tion in the ab­sence of civil­i­sa­tion.</p>
    <p>Breg­man took it upon him­self to seek out a real-life ex­am­ple: Six Ton­gan school­boys who were marooned on the is­land of ’Ata in 1965 for more than a year un­til they were res­cued by an Aus­tralian sea cap­tain.</p>
    <p>With his wife, pho­tog­ra­pher Maartje ter Horst, he tracked down the cap­tain, Mr Peter Warner, and one of the cast­aways, Mr Mano To­tau, who told him that the real-life Lord Of The Flies turned out quite well: The boys set up a ros­ter for chores, re­solved con­flicts through time­outs and even healed one of their num­ber who fell off a cliff and broke his leg. Af­ter they re­turned to civil­i­sa­tion, they re­mained friends and were hired by Cap­tain Warner to crew his fish­ing boat.</p>
    <p>It is a heart­warm­ing story con­signed to ob­scu­rity, says Breg­man, be­cause cyn­i­cism sells bet­ter.</p>
    <p>Hu­mankind moves from pre­his­toric times to the pre­sent day, along the way ex­am­in­ing and de­bunk­ing numer­ous fa­mous case stud­ies, from the 1971 Stan­ford Prison Ex­per­i­ment, in which vol­un­teers were as­signed to be “guards” and “pris­on­ers” in a mock prison, to the mys­tery of Easter Is­land, which schol­ars thought for a long time was a civil­i­sa­tion run i nto the ground by mass vi­o­lence and can­ni­bal­ism.</p>
    <p>But if the hu­man race evolved into what Breg­man calls “homo puppy”, friendly and ea­ger to please, then why are they also ca­pa­ble of com­mit­ting hor­rific acts against one an­other? Be­cause they can be ide­o­log­i­cally ma­nip­u­lated by those in power into do­ing so, he ar­gues, if they be­lieve what they are do­ing is ul­ti­mately for good.</p>
    <p>He the­o­rises that em­pa­thy and xeno­pho­bia are two sides of the same coin, both driven by the hu­man need to be­long.</p>
    <p>“Em­pa­thy is a hope­lessly lim­ited skill,” he writes. It fo­cuses on the ex­cep­tional, but is ex­haust­ing when ap­plied to the many. Em­pa­thy, he ar­gues, makes peo­ple less for­giv­ing be­cause the more they iden­tify with vic­tims, the more they gen­er­alise about their en­e­mies. He be­lieves that com­pas­sion, not em­pa­thy, is a more ef­fec­tive so­lu­tion.</p>
    <p>He laughs off the as­sump­tion that his book is “warm and friendly”.</p>
    <p>“It’s a dan­ger­ous book as well. Be­cause if we can­not trust one an­other, then we need the hi­er­ar­chies. We need the gen­er­als and the kings and all the lead­ers and chief ex­ec­u­tive of­fi­cers be­cause we have to be con­trolled.</p>
    <p>“Now, if I’m say­ing that ac­tu­ally, we can be trusted and most peo­ple are pretty de­cent and can work to­gether, then maybe we don’t need all th­ese hi­er­ar­chies.</p>
    <p>“And this is also the rea­son why through­out his­tory, those who have ad­vo­cated a more hope­ful view of hu­man na­ture have of­ten been per­se­cuted by those in power.”</p>
