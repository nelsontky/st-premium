    <p>• The last fully in­tact ice shelf in the Cana­dian Arc­tic has col­lapsed, los­ing over 40 per cent of its area in just two days at the end of last month, re­searchers said.</p>
    <p>The Milne Ice Shelf is at the fringe of Ellesmere Is­land, in the sparsely pop­u­lated north­ern Cana­dian ter­ri­tory of Nu­navut.</p>
    <p>“Above-nor­mal air tem­per­a­tures, off­shore winds and open wa­ter in front of the ice shelf are all part of the recipe for ice shelf break-up,” the Cana­dian Ice Ser­vice said on Twit­ter when it an­nounced the loss last Sun­day.</p>
    <p>“En­tire cities are that size. These are big pieces of ice,” said Pro­fes­sor Luke Co­p­land, a glaciol­o­gist at the Univer­sity of Ot­tawa who was part of the re­search team study­ing the Milne Ice Shelf.</p>
    <p>The shelf’s area shrank by about 80 square km. By com­par­i­son, the is­land of Man­hat­tan in New York cov­ers roughly 60 sq km.</p>
    <p>“This was the largest re­main­ing in­tact ice shelf, and it’s dis­in­te­grated, ba­si­cally,” Dr Co­p­land said.</p>
    <p>The Arc­tic has been warm­ing at twice the global rate for the last 30 years, due to a process known as Arc­tic am­pli­fi­ca­tion.</p>
    <p>But this year, tem­per­a­tures in the po­lar re­gion have been in­tense. The po­lar sea ice hit its low­est ex­tent for July in 40 years. Record heat and wild­fires have scorched Siberian Rus­sia. Sum­mer in the Cana­dian Arc­tic this year in par­tic­u­lar has been 5 deg Cel­sius above the 30-year av­er­age, Dr Co­p­land said.</p>
    <p>That has threat­ened smaller ice caps, which can melt quickly be­cause they do not have the bulk that larger glaciers have to stay cold. As a glacier dis­ap­pears, more bedrock is ex­posed, which then heats up and ac­cel­er­ates the melt­ing process.</p>
    <p>“The very small ones, we’re los­ing them dra­mat­i­cally,” he said, cit­ing re­searchers’ re­views of satel­lite im­agery. “You feel like you’re on a sink­ing is­land chas­ing these fea­tures, and these are large fea­tures. It’s not as if it’s a lit­tle tiny patch of ice you find in your gar­den.”</p>
    <p>The ice shelf col­lapse on Ellesmere Is­land also meant the loss of the north­ern hemi­sphere’s last known epishelf lake, a ge­o­graphic fea­ture in which a body of fresh­wa­ter is dammed by the ice shelf and floats atop ocean wa­ter.</p>
    <p>A re­search camp, in­clud­ing in­stru­ments for mea­sur­ing wa­ter flow through the ice shelf, was lost when the shelf col­lapsed.</p>
    <p>“It is lucky we were not on the ice shelf when this hap­pened,” said re­searcher Derek Mueller of Car­leton Univer­sity in Ot­tawa, in an Aug 2 blog post.</p>
    <p>Ellesmere Is­land also lost its two St Pa­trick Bay ice caps this sum­mer.</p>
    <p>“We saw them go­ing, like some­one with ter­mi­nal cancer. It was only a mat­ter of time,” said Dr Mark Ser­reze, direc­tor of the Na­tional Snow and Ice Data Cen­tre (NSIDC) in Boul­der, Colorado.</p>
    <p>Dr Ser­reze and other NSIDC sci­en­tists had pub­lished a 2017 study pre­dict­ing the ice caps were likely to dis­ap­pear within five years. The ice caps were be­lieved to have formed sev­eral cen­turies ago.</p>
    <p>The Milne Ice Shelf van­ish­ing was con­firmed last month, when Nasa satel­lite shots of the re­gion re­vealed a com­plete lack of snow and ice, said Dr Ser­reze, who stud­ied the caps as a grad­u­ate stu­dent on his first trip to the Arc­tic years ago.</p>
    <p>At the time, he said, the ice caps had seemed like im­mov­able parts of the geog­ra­phy.</p>
    <p>“When I was there in the 1980s I knew every square inch of those ice caps,” he said. “You have the mem­o­ries. It’s like your first girl­friend.”</p>
    <p>Mean­while, an­other two ice caps on Ellesmere Is­land – called Mur­ray and Sim­mons – are also di­min­ish­ing and are likely to dis­ap­pear within 10 years, Dr Ser­reze said.</p>
