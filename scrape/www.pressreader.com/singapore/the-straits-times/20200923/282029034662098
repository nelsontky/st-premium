    <p>The good Sa­mar­i­tans who chased and re­strained a man for al­legedly tak­ing up­skirt pic­tures in Lit­tle In­dia last year had not used ex­ces­sive force, and his death was due to a “nat­u­ral disease process”, said State Coro­ner Ka­mala Pon­nam­palam.</p>
    <p>But she added that it is prefer­able and safer for the po­lice to han­dle such mat­ters.</p>
    <p>In an in­quiry into Mr An­drew Ho Chee Meng’s death, the state coro­ner added that fol­low­ing an au­topsy, the 46-year-old Sin­ga­porean was found to have died from hy­pothy­roid car­diomy­opa­thy.</p>
    <p>The Sin­ga­pore Gen­eral Hos­pi­tal’s web­site states that car­diomy­opa­thy is a disease of the heart mus­cle.</p>
    <p>A Health Sci­ences Author­ity foren­sic pathol­o­gist who con­ducted the au­topsy said that Mr Ho had a his­tory of hy­pothy­roidism, which made the heart slow to re­cover from its con­trac­tion in time for the next one.</p>
    <p>The pathol­o­gist also felt that the stress of running while be­ing chased and Mr Ho’s sub­se­quent re­straint con­trib­uted to his death.</p>
    <p>State Coro­ner Ka­mala said in her find­ings dated Sept 11 that pub­lic par­tic­i­pa­tion in crime pre­ven­tion ef­forts is “nec­es­sary and ought to be en­cour­aged”.</p>
    <p>She added: “It may be pru­dent, how­ever, to pro­mote re­port­ing to po­lice or seek­ing po­lice as­sis­tance as the pre­ferred and safer op­tion.”</p>
    <p>She noted that the wit­nesses made no at­tempt to re­po­si­tion Mr Ho or ac­tively check that he was well, even though he had vom­ited.</p>
    <p>Video footage of the in­ci­dent showed that Mr Ho later stopped strug­gling and was ly­ing mo­tion­less on the ground for three min­utes.</p>
    <p>The wit­nesses, how­ever, “ei­ther did not ob­serve this or did not think that it was sig­nif­i­cant”, said the state coro­ner.</p>
    <p>She said that Mr Ho’s un­re­spon­sive state was de­tected only af­ter po­lice of­fi­cers ar­rived at the scene and one of them found that he did not have a pulse.</p>
    <p>The state coro­ner said: “The wit­nesses were ob­vi­ously un­aware of the med­i­cal risks as­so­ci­ated with meth­ods of re­straint or the need to con­tin­u­ally mon­i­tor as a means of mit­i­gat­ing that risk.</p>
    <p>“That said, it is noted that the wit­nesses did not be­have in an overly ag­gres­sive man­ner with Mr An­drew or use ex­ces­sive force to re­strain him.”</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to the find­ings, a man iden­ti­fied as Mr Ng Kim Tong was at the foot of an as­cend­ing es­ca­la­tor at Lit­tle In­dia MRT sta­tion at 12.40pm on Nov 1 last year when he spot­ted Mr Ho try­ing to snap up­skirt pic­tures of a woman.</p>
    <p>He chased Mr Ho, and two other men – Mr Nar­dozi Thierry and Mr Rudy Iskandar Khan Nasir Khan – later joined the pur­suit.</p>
    <p>The trio man­aged to de­tain Mr Ho at a pave­ment in nearby Niven Road, and he was ly­ing face down on the ground when they re­strained him.</p>
    <p>They held on to Mr Ho’s limbs, and Mr Nar­dozi took away his mo­bile phone.</p>
    <p>The po­lice were alerted, and the de­vice was later found to have 47 up­skirt pho­tos.</p>
    <p>Two more men – Mr Leong Cheng Fong and Mr Rac­mat Hi­day­at­tul­lah Has­bul­lah – came for­ward soon af­ter and helped to re­strain Mr Ho.</p>
    <p>Po­lice ar­rived at the scene at about 12.50pm, and Mr Ho was found to be un­re­spon­sive when an of­fi­cer tapped his shoul­der.</p>
    <p>State Coro­ner Ka­mala said: “One of the men who had ear­lier re­strained Mr An­drew re­marked that Mr An­drew was putting on an act be­cause the po­lice were there.”</p>
    <p>The of­fi­cer checked for a pulse but could not de­tect one.</p>
    <p>Two of­fi­cers then per­formed car­diopul­monary re­sus­ci­ta­tion on Mr Ho, and paramedics ar­rived at about 1.10pm. He was pro­nounced dead three min­utes later.</p>
    <p>The wit­nesses were ob­vi­ously un­aware of the med­i­cal risks as­so­ci­ated with meth­ods of re­straint... That said, it is noted that the wit­nesses did not be­have in an overly ag­gres­sive man­ner with Mr An­drew or use ex­ces­sive force to re­strain him.</p>
