    <p>A 31-year-old man from In­dia who tested pos­i­tive af­ter com­plet­ing his stay-home no­tice (SHN) was among the four im­ported cases con­firmed yesterday, said the Min­istry of Health (MOH).</p>
    <p>The train­ing em­ploy­ment pass holder served his SHN at a ded­i­cated fa­cil­ity upon ar­rival in Sin­ga­pore on Sept 25. He was tested on Oct 5 while serv­ing the SHN and his test re­sult was neg­a­tive.</p>
    <p>He com­pleted his SHN last Fri­day and had an on­set of symp­toms on the same day. He sub­se­quently tested pos­i­tive for Covid-19 in­fec­tion on Mon­day in a pre-de­par­ture test taken in or­der to re­turn to In­dia.</p>
    <p>Be­tween last Fri­day and Mon­day, he had mostly re­mained at a hos­tel, Dream Lodge Sin­ga­pore (172 Tyr­whitt Road), but he vis­ited the Na­tional Univer­sity Health Sys­tem (NUHS) Tower Block last Fri­day.</p>
    <p>The four im­ported cases con­firmed yesterday took Sin­ga­pore’s to­tal to 57,884.</p>
    <p>There were no new lo­cal cases in the com­mu­nity or from work­ers’ dor­mi­to­ries yesterday, said MOH. This was the first time since March 25 that no new cases from dor­mi­to­ries were re­ported.</p>
    <p>The re­main­ing three im­ported cases com­prised a per­ma­nent res­i­dent who re­turned from In­dia, a stu­dent’s pass holder who ar­rived from France and a short-term visit pass holder who was al­lowed en­try from the United King­dom to visit a fam­ily mem­ber hos­pi­talised here.</p>
    <p>They were all placed on 14-day SHN upon ar­rival in Sin­ga­pore and were tested while serv­ing their SHN.</p>
    <p>MOH also an­nounced that the clus­ter at Mandai Lodge 1 (460 Mandai Road) has been closed as it has not had new cases linked to it for 28 days, or two in­cu­ba­tion pe­ri­ods.</p>
    <p>The av­er­age num­ber of new daily cases in the com­mu­nity in a week has de­creased from two cases two weeks ago to fewer than one in the past week.</p>
    <p>The num­ber of un­linked cases in the com­mu­nity in a week has also de­creased from a daily av­er­age of fewer than one case to none over the same pe­riod.</p>
    <p>With 12 cases dis­charged yesterday, 57,725 pa­tients have fully re­cov­ered from the dis­ease.</p>
    <p>A to­tal of 35 pa­tients re­main in hospi­tal, with none in in­ten­sive care, while 81 are re­cu­per­at­ing in com­mu­nity fa­cil­i­ties.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore has had 28 deaths from Covid-19 com­pli­ca­tions, while 15 who tested pos­i­tive have died of other causes.</p>
    <p>A to­tal of 35 pa­tients re­main in hospi­tal, with none in in­ten­sive care, while 81 are re­cu­per­at­ing in com­mu­nity fa­cil­i­ties.</p>
