    <p>LON­DON • De­spite Burn­ley’s win­less start to the Premier League sea­son, Jose Mour­inho has warned his Tot­ten­ham side that they can­not af­ford to be com­pla­cent at Turf Moor.</p>
    <p>Hav­ing scored 31 goals in their last nine matches in all com­pe­ti­tions, Spurs have lit­tle is­sue go­ing for­ward but re­main sus­pect de­fen­sively, as ev­i­dent in their 3-3 draw with West Ham.</p>
    <p>Mour­inho’s men face Sean Dy­che’s side to­day and while he ad­mit­ted the vis­i­tors are feel­ing “con­fi­dent”, he also feels that the Clarets are bet­ter than their third from bot­tom po­si­tion sug­gests.</p>
    <p>“You will feel how strong they are by March, April when lots of teams will be fight­ing to avoid rel­e­ga­tion and they will al­ready be safe,” the Spurs man­ager said ahead of their trip.</p>
    <p>“Burn­ley is Burn­ley. The way they play, the play­ers they have, their style of play, the man­ager – noth­ing changes there. It is al­ways dif­fi­cult, and it is go­ing to be dif­fi­cult. So I ex­pect a very dif­fi­cult match and to be scor­ing goals is a con­se­quence of how well we are play­ing. That of course brings con­fi­dence. We will go there con­fi­dent. But I have to make sure I pass to the play­ers my feel­ings and my feel­ings don’t change since the first day I played Burn­ley. It’s dif­fi­cult.”</p>
    <p>But un­like Dy­che, who had a frus­trat­ing trans­fer win­dow with only Dale Stephens ar­riv­ing on a cut­price deal, Mour­inho was able to sub­stan­tially aug­ment his squad, leav­ing him de­lighted with the qual­ity he has at his dis­posal.</p>
    <p>“Very happy with the squad,” the Por­tuguese said. “Of course next sum­mer, I will need to give an­other cou­ple of touches but this is what you al­ways do to im­prove.</p>
    <p>“You look for ex­am­ple to Liver­pool, how many years Jur­gen (Klopp) has been there, how many trans­fer win­dows he went to the mar­ket and im­proved the team.</p>
    <p>“I don’t want to try and com­pare us with Liver­pool, of course not, but what we need now is time to work and to im­prove our dy­namic at ev­ery level.”</p>
