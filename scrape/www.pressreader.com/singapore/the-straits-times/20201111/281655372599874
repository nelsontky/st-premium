    <p>Sin­ga­pore is will­ing to re­open its borders fur­ther, but this has to be done safely be­cause of the vary­ing lev­els of in­fec­tion and risk in the re­gion and around the world, Ed­u­ca­tion Min­is­ter Lawrence Wong said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Out­lin­ing the coun­try’s gen­eral ap­proach on the mat­ter, he said: “Our over­all pos­ture to­wards the open­ing of our borders is one where we are, in prin­ci­ple, pre­pared to con­sider more open­ing up, but it has to be done safely and with ap­pro­pri­ate safe­guards.”</p>
    <p>There­fore, if a coun­try Sin­ga­pore is in dis­cus­sions on re­open­ing travel with has a sim­i­lar in­ci­dence rate of Covid-19 in­fec­tion as Sin­ga­pore, al­low­ing its trav­ellers test­ing in place of hav­ing to serve a stay­home no­tice (SHN), or a short­ened SHN of about seven days at their res­i­dence, can be con­sid­ered.</p>
    <p>How­ever, if a coun­try has a higher rate of in­fec­tion and its trav­ellers are as­sessed to be of higher risk, the full 14-day SHN must ap­ply, the min­is­ter added.</p>
    <p>“Most of them will be in the ded­i­cated fa­cil­i­ties and ho­tels, but in some in­stances, based on risk as­sess­ment, we might al­low them to stay at home but sub­ject to wear­ing an elec­tronic mon­i­tor­ing de­vice,” he said.</p>
    <p>Mr Wong, who co-chairs the Multi-min­istry Task­force tack­ling the coro­n­avirus, was re­spond­ing to ques­tions from re­porters on Sin­ga­pore re­open­ing its borders, in­clud­ing for trav­ellers from ju­ris­dic­tions such as South-east Asian coun­tries, Tai­wan and Ma­cau.</p>
    <p>At yes­ter­day’s press con­fer­ence, the task force an­nounced that all in­bound trav­ellers from high-risk places who are not Sin­ga­pore cit­i­zens or per­ma­nent res­i­dents will also have to take a Covid-19 poly­merase chain re­ac­tion (PCR) test 72 hours be­fore their de­par­ture.</p>
    <p>Mr Wong said whether places are low-risk or high-risk will be ad­justed from time to time.</p>
    <p>Asked about In­done­sia’s plan to pro­pose a re­gional travel cor­ri­dor when Asean lead­ers meet vir­tu­ally at their bian­nual sum­mit this week, and whether Sin­ga­pore will sup­port it, Mr Wong noted that there have not been a lot of de­tails put out to con­sider specif­i­cally.</p>
    <p>But he said the same prin­ci­ples the task force out­lined will ap­ply.</p>
    <p>“Within the re­gion, the coun­tries have dif­fer­ent in­ci­dence rates, dif­fer­ent preva­lence rates. You can­not ap­ply a sin­gle mea­sure to all the coun­tries in the re­gion. We will still look at it, coun­try by coun­try, and ap­ply these same prin­ci­ples to in­di­vid­ual coun­tries.”</p>
    <p>He was also asked why trav­ellers from Ma­cau and Tai­wan, both of which have re­ported zero com­mu­nity cases for some time, still have to serve a seven-day SHN upon ar­rival in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>Mr Wong said the re­quire­ments are “where it is now”, and could be ad­justed later on if Ma­cau and Tai­wan con­tinue to re­main low-risk.</p>
    <p>The sit­u­a­tion is chang­ing by the day and Sin­ga­pore is watch­ing de­vel­op­ments very closely, he added.</p>
    <p>“The as­sess­ments of risk are dy­namic and will con­stantly evolve. From time to time, ad­just­ments will be made as to where these dif­fer­ent coun­tries or places are banded.”</p>
    <p>Mr Wong added that Sin­ga­pore is keen on dis­cussing air travel bub­bles with places that have a sim­i­lar Covid-19 in­ci­dence rate as Sin­ga­pore, or are safe and low-risk. Sin­ga­pore has a travel bub­ble ar­range­ment with Hong Kong that is ex­pected to kick off later this month.</p>
    <p>Whether more such ar­range­ments can be made will de­pend on whether both ju­ris­dic­tions can come to an agree­ment, he said.</p>
    <p>“We do not have travel bub­bles with all the places which are low­er­risk be­cause that re­quires bi­lat­eral ne­go­ti­a­tions and agree­ment on both sides mu­tu­ally. We con­tinue to dis­cuss these pos­si­bil­i­ties.”</p>
