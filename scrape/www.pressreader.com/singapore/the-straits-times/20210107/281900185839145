    <p>LON­DON • Wik­iLeaks founder Ju­lian As­sange was de­nied bail yes­ter­day by a Bri­tish judge who said there was a risk he might flee jus­tice while the United States tries again to se­cure his ex­tra­di­tion.</p>
    <p>As­sange, who has spent more than eight years ei­ther holed up in the Ecuadorean em­bassy in Lon­don or in jail, had asked to be freed on bail af­ter the court ruled on Mon­day that he should not be ex­tra­dited be­cause he would be at risk of sui­cide.</p>
    <p>“I am sat­is­fied that there are sub­stan­tial grounds for be­liev­ing that if Mr As­sange is re­leased to­day he would fail to sur­ren­der to court to face the ap­peal pro­ceed­ings,” Judge Vanessa Baraitser said.</p>
    <p>“As far as Mr As­sange is con­cerned this case has not yet been won... the out­come of this ap­peal is not yet known.”</p>
    <p>The US Depart­ment of Jus­tice says it will con­tinue to seek As­sange’s ex­tra­di­tion to face 18 crim­i­nal charges of break­ing an es­pi­onage law and con­spir­ing to hack gov­ern­ment com­put­ers.</p>
    <p>As­sange’s part­ner, Ms Stella Moris, said the judge’s de­ci­sion to deny him bail was a huge dis­ap­point­ment and urged the US to par­don him. Wik­iLeaks said it would ap­peal against the de­nial of bail.</p>
    <p>Aus­tralian-born As­sange, 49, has been hailed by his ad­mir­ers as a hero for ex­pos­ing what they de­scribe as abuses of power by the US. But de­trac­tors cast him as a dan­ger­ous fig­ure who has un­der­mined the se­cu­rity of the West, and dis­pute that he is a jour­nal­ist.</p>
    <p>Wik­iLeaks pub­lished hun­dreds of thou­sands of se­cret Amer­i­can diplo­matic ca­bles that laid bare of­ten crit­i­cal US ap­praisals of world lead­ers, from Russian Pres­i­dent Vladimir Putin to mem­bers of the Saudi royal fam­ily.</p>
    <p>As­sange made world head­lines in early 2010 when Wik­iLeaks pub­lished a clas­si­fied US mil­i­tary video show­ing a 2007 at­tack by Apache he­li­copters that killed a dozen peo­ple i n Bagh­dad, i nclud­ing two Reuters news em­ploy­ees.</p>
    <p>Ms Clair Dob­bin, a lawyer rep­re­sent­ing the US at the hear­ing, said As­sange had gone to ex­tra­or­di­nary lengths to avoid ex­tra­di­tion and that he could try to l eave the United King­dom to flee jus­tice.</p>
    <p>“This court should be in no doubt as to Mr As­sange’s re­sources, abil­i­ties and sheer where­withal to ar­range flight to an­other coun­try,” Ms Dob­bin said. “This court should be un­der no il­lu­sion ei­ther as to the readi­ness of other states to of­fer Mr As­sange pro­tec­tion.”</p>
    <p>She said the ex­tra­di­tion re­quest had been de­nied “on a sin­gle ground, that of his men­tal health. It is a de­ci­sion that hangs on a sin­gle thread”.</p>
