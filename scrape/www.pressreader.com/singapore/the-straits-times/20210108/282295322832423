    <p>KUALA LUMPUR • The board of di­rec­tors of Malaysian com­pany Top Glove – the world’s largest maker of med­i­cal-grade gloves – has failed egre­giously in pro­tect­ing its work­ers from Covid-19, US i nvestor Black­Rock said, call­ing for its re­moval.</p>
    <p>The com­ments from the world’s big­gest as­set manager come af­ter Top Glove saw an ex­ten­sive coron­avirus out­break among its work­ers late last year. More than 5,000 for­eign work­ers were in­fected and one died, in what be­came Malaysia’s big­gest clus­ter.</p>
    <p>Reuters re­ported last month that Top Glove fired a whis­tle-blower who had raised con­cerns about the firm’s lack of Covid-19 mit­i­ga­tion ef­forts. Work­ers told Reuters that they lived in crowded dor­mi­to­ries.</p>
    <p>Black­Rock cited work­ers’ ac­counts of work­ing and living con­di­tions, the fir­ing of the whistle­blower and the virus clus­ter at Top Glove in its crit­i­cism of the board.</p>
    <p>It also voted against re-elect­ing six board mem­bers at Top Glove’s an­nual gen­eral meet­ing on Wed­nes­day.</p>
    <p>“We view the board’s in­ef­fec­tive­ness in Covid-19 mit­i­ga­tion, and in­ad­e­quate over­sight of worker health and safety is­sues as es­pe­cially egre­gious, with po­ten­tially se­ri­ous im­pli­ca­tions for its rep­u­ta­tion as a sup­plier of such equip­ment to hos­pi­tals around the world,” Black­Rock said in a state­ment late on Wed­nes­day.</p>
    <p>Top Glove did not im­me­di­ately re­spond to a re­quest for com­ment.</p>
    <p>The com­pany has ac­knowl­edged that much more needs to be done to raise the stan­dard of em­ployee wel­fare and has promised to quickly rec­tify short­com­ings.</p>
    <p>A Black­Rock unit, Black­Rock In­sti­tu­tional Trust, is the 10th-big­gest share­holder in Top Glove, with 1.07 per cent of its shares. The glove maker is dual-listed in Kuala Lumpur and Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>Black­Rock said it in­tended to hold other in­cum­bent di­rec­tors ac­count­able by vot­ing against their re-elec­tion at fu­ture meet­ings.</p>
    <p>An in­flu­en­tial Nor­we­gian sov­er­eign wealth fund, man­aged by Norges Bank In­vest­ment Man­age­ment (NBIM), also voted against the board’s re-elec­tion, ac­cord­ing to vot­ing records on NBIM’s web­site. The fund, which owns 0.84 per cent of Top Glove shares, de­clined to com­ment on worker safety con­cerns.</p>
    <p>The board mem­bers were re­elected de­spite the ob­jec­tions.</p>
    <p>Black­Rock’s com­ments are the first public crit­i­cism of Top Glove from an in­vestor since the virus out­break among work­ers.</p>
    <p>Top Glove posted record prof­its last year as de­mand for its prod­ucts soared due to the coron­avirus pan­demic. Its share price more than tripled last year.</p>
    <p>Last July, the United States banned two units of Top Glove over forced labour al­le­ga­tions. The Malaysian au­thor­i­ties plan to charge the com­pany over poor worker ac­com­mo­da­tion.</p>
    <p>Black­Rock said the living con­di­tions de­scribed by the work­ers were in “stark con­trast” to what the board had con­veyed to share­hold­ers.</p>
    <p>Top Glove’s fac­to­ries, some of which were closed due to the out­break, re­opened last month.</p>
