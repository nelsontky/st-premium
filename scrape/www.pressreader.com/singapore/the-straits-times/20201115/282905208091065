    <p>If I tell you what this means, I won’t be able to talk. The guys work so hard in these con­di­tions.</p>
    <p>MARIO LEDESMA, Ar­gentina rugby coach, get­ting emo­tional on what the shocker meant to his side, who had only two prac­tice games ow­ing to the coro­n­avirus.</p>
    <p>SYDNEY • Just be­fore the fi­nal whis­tle yes­ter­day, Mario Ledesma was caught on cam­era cov­er­ing his eyes with his hand, as the emo­tional Ar­gentina coach took a cou­ple of brief mo­ments to com­pose him­self.</p>
    <p>His gutsy side had just stunned the All Blacks 25-15 to pull off one of rugby’s big­gest up­sets, con­sign­ing an em­bar­rassed New Zealand to their first back-to-back de­feats in al­most a decade.</p>
    <p>Fly-half Ni­co­las Sanchez scored all the Pu­mas’ points to hand them their maiden vic­tory over the rugby pow­er­houses in the 30 Tests they have played go­ing back 35 years.</p>
    <p>Ledesma’s men were given vir­tu­ally no chance ahead of the Tri Na­tions match in Sydney, after the coro­n­avirus pandemic hin­dered their prepa­ra­tions to just two lowkey prac­tice games. But in their first Test since the World Cup last year, they pulled off a mir­a­cle.</p>
    <p>“It’s sur­real what hap­pened, not just the re­sult but play­ing, get­ting on the field after ev­ery­thing that has hap­pened this year,” said Ledesma, who was still vis­i­bly over­wrought dur­ing his post-match in­ter­view.</p>
    <p>“If I tell you what this means, I won’t be able to talk. The guys work so hard in these con­di­tions.</p>
    <p>“Some of the boys haven’t seen their fam­i­lies for four months but they have all been pos­i­tive... they have been awe­some.</p>
    <p>“And then com­ing out here and play­ing the game that they played, it is in­cred­i­ble. So proud of them. I think we will re­mem­ber this for a long time, not only the game but be­cause of the spe­cial sit­u­a­tion.”</p>
    <p>It was a hu­mil­i­at­ing de­feat for New Zealand, who were shocked 24-22 by the Wal­la­bies in Bris­bane last week and have now lost backto-back Tests for the first time since 2011 when they crashed to South Africa and Aus­tralia.</p>
    <p>Coach Ian Fos­ter axed 10 play­ers and named what many re­garded as the All Blacks’ best run-on side after last week’s game, but they were no match for a Pu­mas team helped by for­mer Aus­tralia coach Michael Cheika.</p>
    <p>“Ob­vi­ously from an All Black view we are bit­terly dis­ap­pointed with the re­sult, with the way we played,” said Fos­ter.</p>
    <p>“But what I think we saw was a team that de­spite the dis­ad­van­tage of not play­ing a lot of rugby... they have come here with mas­sive en­ergy and a de­sire to prove some­thing to their coun­try which has gone through a heck of a hard time.</p>
    <p>“I want to con­grat­u­late them on the re­sult, it is a bit of an his­toric day for them.”</p>
    <p>Un­like Aus­tralia and New Zealand, Ar­gentina did not have a Su­per Rugby com­pe­ti­tion to help them pre­pare. But, after months of quar­an­tine, they took their frus­tra­tions out on the sloppy All Blacks in a dom­i­nant first half.</p>
    <p>An in­spired Sanchez scored all of Ar­gentina’s points with a try, six penal­ties and a con­ver­sion, and the Pu­mas held off a fierce late on­slaught from the All Blacks to se­cure their fa­mous vic­tory.</p>
    <p>“It’s a big game for Ar­gentina rugby to­day,” an emo­tional cap­tain Pablo Mat­era said on the pitch. “We’re used to (ad­ver­sity), it’s al­ways tough for Ar­gentina.</p>
    <p>“We just wanted to show our peo­ple that if you work hard, you get your re­wards.”</p>
    <p>New Zealand re­main top of the stand­ings with six points ahead of Aus­tralia and Ar­gentina, who both have four, but that mat­tered not a jot to the Pu­mas after they fi­nally com­pleted the full set of wins over the top-tier rugby na­tions.</p>
