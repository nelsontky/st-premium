    <p>Thai­land’s Par­lia­ment will hold a spe­cial ses­sion next week to dis­cuss de­mands of pro-democ­racy pro­test­ers af­ter emer­gency rules and po­lice crack­downs on ac­tivists failed to halt daily ral­lies across the na­tion’s cap­i­tal and other ma­jor cities.</p>
    <p>BANGKOK Thai­land’s Par­lia­ment will hold a spe­cial ses­sion next week to dis­cuss the de­mands of pro-democ­racy pro­test­ers, af­ter emer­gency rules and po­lice crack­downs on ac­tivists failed to halt daily ral­lies across the na­tion’s cap­i­tal and other ma­jor cities.</p>
    <p>A Cabi­net meet­ing chaired by Prime Min­is­ter Prayut Chan-o-cha agreed to sup­port a two-day sit­ting of Par­lia­ment from next Mon­day, Mr Anucha Naka­sai, Min­is­ter for the Prime Min­is­ter’s Of­fice, told re­porters in Bangkok yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The pro­posal still needs to be en­dorsed by King Maha Va­ji­ra­longkorn.</p>
    <p>The move for par­lia­men­tary de­bate fol­lows six straight days of ral­lies at­tended by tens of thou­sands of pro­test­ers call­ing for Mr Prayut’s res­ig­na­tion, a rewrit­ing of the Con­sti­tu­tion and re­form of the monar­chy.</p>
    <p>While the Prime Min­is­ter did not say yes­ter­day how far the gov­ern­ment could go in meet­ing pro­test­ers’ de­mands, Par­lia­ment may move for­ward the process of con­sti­tu­tional amend­ment to pla­cate them.</p>
    <p>“Given the es­ca­lat­ing protest move­ment, Par­lia­ment won’t be able to de­lay the process for char­ter amend­ment any longer,” said Dr Virot Ali, lec­turer at Tham­masat Univer­sity’s Fac­ulty of Po­lit­i­cal Sci­ence. “The move might be a tactic to buy time with­out re­ally con­sid­er­ing what the pro­test­ers de­mand, which will es­ca­late the move­ment even fur­ther.”</p>
    <p>Deputy Prime Min­is­ter Su­pat­tanapong Pun­meechaow had said on Mon­day that the on­go­ing protests were a po­lit­i­cal prob­lem that needed to be solved us­ing po­lit­i­cal pro­cesses.</p>
    <p>The pro­test­ers have vowed to carry on the demon­stra­tions un­til all their de­mands are met.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day evening, thou­sands again gath­ered at var­i­ous lo­ca­tions in and around Bangkok and flashed the anti-dic­ta­tor­ship three-fin­ger salute to the na­tional an­them.</p>
    <p>The demon­stra­tions were rel­a­tively sub­dued af­ter protest or­gan­is­ers on so­cial me­dia urged demon­stra­tors to go home and save their en­ergy for a fresh rally today, re­ported the Bangkok Post.</p>
    <p>Protests have gained mo­men­tum since the gov­ern­ment an­nounced a ban on gath­er­ings of more than four peo­ple last Thurs­day.</p>
    <p>Dozens have been ar­rested, in­clud­ing the move­ment’s lead­ers largely made up of young peo­ple and stu­dents.</p>
    <p>Two de­tained protest lead­ers – Parit “Pen­guin” Chi­warak and Panusaya “Rung” Sithi­ji­rawat­tanakul – were ar­rested again yes­ter­day as soon as they had been freed on bail granted by a court over ear­lier charges re­lated to the protests.</p>
    <p>Street protests since mid-July are the big­gest chal­lenge in decades to the monar­chy and to Mr Prayut, who re­jects ac­cu­sa­tions of en­gi­neer­ing an elec­tion last year to keep power.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, a Thai court or­dered the sus­pen­sion of an on­line TV sta­tion for vi­o­lat­ing emer­gency mea­sures aimed at end­ing the protests.</p>
    <p>An­other three me­dia out­lets are be­ing probed for sim­i­lar of­fences.</p>
    <p>Voice TV had also been found to have breached the Com­puter Crime Act by up­load­ing “false in­for­ma­tion”, dig­i­tal min­istry spokesman Putchapong Nodthaison­g told re­porters.</p>
    <p>Mr Rit­tikorn Ma­hakhachab­horn, editor-in-chief of Voice TV, said it would con­tinue broad­cast­ing un­til the court or­der ar­rived.</p>
    <p>“We in­sist that we have been op­er­at­ing based on jour­nal­is­tic prin­ci­ples, and we will con­tinue our work presently,” he said.</p>
    <p>POS­SI­BLE DE­LAY­ING TACTIC</p>
    <p>Voice TV is owned in part by the fam­ily of for­mer prime min­is­ter Thaksin Shi­nawa­tra and his sis­ter Yingluck, who was over­thrown by Mr Prayut in a 2014 coup.</p>
    <p>Mr Prayut has said he will not quit in the face of the protests. How­ever, yes­ter­day, he or­dered the po­lice to re­con­sider their cen­sor­ship of me­dia out­lets.</p>
    <p>“Our job is to pro­tect the coun­try and elim­i­nate ill-in­ten­tioned ac­tions aimed at cre­at­ing chaos and con­flict in the coun­try,” Mr Prayut told re­porters af­ter the Cabi­net meet­ing.</p>
    <p>Par­lia­ment won’t be able to de­lay the process for char­ter amend­ment any longer... The move might be a tactic to buy time with­out re­ally con­sid­er­ing what the pro­test­ers de­mand, which will es­ca­late the move­ment even fur­ther.</p>
