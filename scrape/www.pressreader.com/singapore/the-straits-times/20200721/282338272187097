    <p>LON­DON • As­ton Villa have a duty to prove their de­trac­tors wrong and can still stave off rel­e­ga­tion from the Premier League de­spite en­dur­ing an in­jury-rav­aged sea­son, man­ager Dean Smith said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Villa are third-last with 31 points, three away from the safety zone with two English top-flight games to play.</p>
    <p>They have won just once in seven league games since the sea­son’s restart last month, but Smith has chal­lenged his side to step up and si­lence the crit­ics who have writ­ten off their chances of sur­vival.</p>
    <p>“I think there’s been pres­sure on us ever since we came back for Project Restart. Ev­ery­body has had us rel­e­gated since March,” he told re­porters in a vir­tual news con­fer­ence ahead of to­day’s clash against 10th-placed Arse­nal.</p>
    <p>“Our job is to go and prove peo­ple wrong. Th­ese play­ers have played un­der pres­sure and they seem to thrive on it.</p>
    <p>“I feel that our per­for­mance lev­els have been good since the restart but we haven’t got the points we de­serve.</p>
    <p>“I feel that play­ers are com­ing to the fore now at the top end of the pitch and start­ing to per­form a lot bet­ter than they were. I’ve given them a few quotes from pun­dits. The lads can go and use that as a pos­i­tive.”</p>
    <p>Smith in­sisted sea­son-end­ing in­juries to Wes­ley and Tom Heaton – the pair tore their an­te­rior cru­ci­ate lig­a­ments in Jan­uary – as well as miss­ing John McGinn for a big chunk of the cam­paign, had con­trib­uted to Villa’s strug­gles.</p>
    <p>“It’s frus­trat­ing be­cause I be­lieve we’ve got the play­ers here. We’ve been ham­pered by some big in­juries this sea­son to key play­ers...</p>
    <p>They would ham­per any team in the league,” he said.</p>
    <p>Arse­nal visit Villa Park on the back of suc­ces­sive wins over cham­pi­ons Liver­pool in the league and Manchester City in the FA Cup, but Smith be­lieves his side are up to the task.</p>
    <p>The Gun­ners still have a slim chance of qual­i­fy­ing for the Europa League via a league fin­ish in the event that they do not win the FA Cup, so the hosts will need to rise to the oc­ca­sion if they are to take their sur­vival bid to the last day of the sea­son at West Ham on Sun­day.</p>
    <p>“We have to con­cen­trate fully on our­selves, it’s a very im­por­tant game. We have to get a re­sult in this game and the play­ers know that,” Smith added.</p>
