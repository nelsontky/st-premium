    <p>Kiss92 FM l aunched its new morn­ing show yes­ter­day with DJ Andre Hoe­den of­fi­cially join­ing in­cum­bents Maddy Bar­ber and Di­vian Nair.</p>
    <p>The new Kiss92 show, ti­tled Maddy, Andre & Di­vian In The Morn­ing, goes on air from 6 to 10am on week­days, and from 10am to noon on Satur­days, and fea­tures the tagline, “Keep­ing it real”. Hoe­den is no stranger to ra­dio lis­ten­ers. The pre­sen­ter and ex­ec­u­tive pro­ducer was pre­vi­ously on One FM 91.3’s morn­ing show with</p>
    <p>DJs Glenn Ong and The Fly­ing Dutch­man. Both sta­tions are run by SPH Ra­dio.</p>
    <p>Hoe­den, who had been with One FM since 2007, when the sta­tion was called 91.3, says his move to Kiss92 was “bit­ter­sweet”.</p>
    <p>He is thank­ful to his for­mer team­mates Ong, The Fly­ing Dutch­man and Shaun Tu­paz.</p>
    <p>“I wouldn’t have moved with­out their bless­ing be­cause I’m fiercely loyal to One FM purely be­cause it was my ‘first love’. I’m eter­nally grate­ful to my ‘broth­ers’.”</p>
    <p>The 45-year-old, who started work­ing with the Kiss92 FM team a month ago, de­scribes his new team­mates as “in­dus­try pow­er­houses”.</p>
    <p>“I have in­cred­i­ble re­spect for my new team­mates and th­ese guys are pro­fes­sional yet edgy and funny. The show has a very dif­fer­ent vibe from One FM and I’m lov­ing it.</p>
    <p>“The syn­ergy we’ve cre­ated is pow­er­ful and we are com­ing for the top spot.”</p>
    <p>He de­scribes Maddy as “a great leader and the queen of ‘keep­ing it real’”.</p>
    <p>“She is sin­cere and knows ex­actly what she wants – I like that. Di­vian may be younger, but is very ex­pe­ri­enced. I have so much to learn from all of them and I’m all in.”</p>
    <p>Bar­ber, 47, says the morn­ing show is for­tu­nate to have Hoe­den join them. “I’ve known Andre for a long time and, apart from be­ing ex­tremely cre­ative and witty, he is also the most hard­work­ing, ex­pe­ri­enced and qual­i­fied ra­dio pro­ducer Sin­ga­pore has ever seen.”</p>
    <p>Nair, 33, says the chem­istry be­tween Hoe­den, Bar­ber and him­self is “full of hope and pos­i­tiv­ity”.</p>
    <p>He adds: “Andre’s generosity and kind­ness help re­in­force the trust that is ul­ti­mately nec­es­sary for a close-knit team to make com­plex de­ci­sions on a day-to-day ba­sis. This is by far the best ra­dio team I’ve ever worked with.”</p>
    <p>Kiss92’s morn­ing show pre­vi­ously fea­tured DJ Ja­son Johnson, who left the team in late Au­gust to pur­sue other in­ter­ests.</p>
