    <p>Al­though one in seven adults in Sin­ga­pore ex­pe­ri­ences men­tal health is­sues at some point in their lives, most Sin­ga­pore­ans say they do not think they know such a per­son, said Dr Wan Rizal Wan Zakariah (Jalan Be­sar GRC).</p>
    <p>The con­tra­dic­tion sug­gests many are un­aware that peo­ple they know face men­tal health is­sues, do not want to know, or deny know­ing such peo­ple be­cause of the stigma as­so­ci­ated with men­tal health is­sues, he said in Par­lia­ment yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>“This is the in­con­ve­nient truth. It is com­mon for us to la­bel peo­ple with men­tal health is­sues as highly emo­tional, men­tally weak, crazy or even nat­u­rally vi­o­lent, and we stay away from them,” he said.</p>
    <p>While cam­paigns to raise aware­ness of men­tal health is­sues and plat­forms for those fac­ing such is­sues to share their ex­pe­ri­ences are both im­por­tant and should con­tinue, it is also im­por­tant to go fur­ther, Dr Wan Rizal said.</p>
    <p>Speak­ing dur­ing an ad­journ­ment mo­tion, the MP sug­gested that men­tal health lit­er­acy pro­grammes be made manda­tory in schools and in­sti­tutes of higher learn­ing (IHLs). Stu­dents would then be able to iden­tify symp­toms of men­tal health prob­lems and be equipped to take steps to ad­dress such symp­toms.</p>
    <p>He said dig­i­tal lit­er­acy for chil­dren is also im­por­tant, given the im­pact of so­cial me­dia on youth men­tal health.</p>
    <p>While so­cial me­dia is an im­por­tant so­cial­is­ing tool, one clear neg­a­tive ef­fect of its ad­vent is cy­ber bul­ly­ing. Dr Wan Rizal said it is not fea­si­ble to leg­is­late against cy­ber bul­ly­ing, but dig­i­tal lit­er­acy pro­grammes for chil­dren might lead fu­ture gen­er­a­tions of so­cial me­dia users to be more dis­cern­ing and more open to up­hold­ing an “un­writ­ten code of con­duct”.</p>
    <p>Ac­cess to places in the com­mu­nity where peo­ple can seek help can also be im­proved, he added.</p>
    <p>“The Com­mu­nity Men­tal Health Pro­gramme by the Min­istry of Health must con­tinue to ex­pand. With 20 poly­clin­ics and over 1,700 GP clin­ics in Sin­ga­pore but only 14 poly­clin­ics and about 200 GPs in the pro­gramme, the touch points cur­rently may not be enough.”</p>
    <p>He also sug­gested that clin­ics, schools, IHLs and work­places pro­vide reg­u­lar men­tal health screen­ings, sim­i­lar to phys­i­cal health screen­ings. Men­tal health “time­outs” could be in­tro­duced in schools and work­places to let in­di­vid­u­als take a break and recharge.</p>
    <p>Stu­dents should also be al­lowed to take “men­tal health day” ab­sences, Dr Wan Rizal said, and the Man­power Min­istry can leg­is­late a “right to dis­con­nect” for work­places, as pro­posed by Mr Melvin Yong (Radin Mas) in Au­gust.</p>
    <p>In re­sponse, Par­lia­men­tary Sec­re­tary for So­cial and Fam­ily De­vel­op­ment and Cul­ture, Com­mu­nity and Youth Eric Chua said the Ed­u­ca­tion Min­istry (MOE) is work­ing to in­cor­po­rate so­cial and emo­tional skills and re­silience in the school cur­ricu­lum, in­clud­ing an en­hanced char­ac­ter and ci­ti­zen­ship ed­u­ca­tion syl­labus fea­tur­ing men­tal health ed­u­ca­tion to be rolled out next year.</p>
    <p>Mr Chua said the in­ter-agency Covid-19 Men­tal Well­ness Task Force will pro­vide a co­or­di­nated re­sponse to the men­tal health needs of Sin­ga­pore­ans aris­ing from the Covid-19 pan­demic.</p>
    <p>“The Gov­ern­ment is firmly com­mit­ted to work with part­ners in the pri­vate and pub­lic sec­tors, not only in erad­i­cat­ing stigma as­so­ci­ated with men­tal health con­di­tions but also en­sur­ing that men­tal health is­sues re­main front and cen­tre in our col­lec­tive so­cial con­scious­ness,” he said.</p>
