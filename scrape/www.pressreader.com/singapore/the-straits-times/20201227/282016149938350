    <p>It is com­mon for bak­eries and restau­rants in Sin­ga­pore to throw out un­sold bread at the end of each day. To cut the waste, CRUST co-founder and CEO Travin Singh, 29, turns such un­used and un­sold bread into beer.</p>
    <p>Q When and how did the is­sue of food waste catch your at­ten­tion?</p>
    <p>A Some time back in Au­gust 2018, when I was do­ing re­search on the ori­gins of beer, I came across quite a num­ber of ar­ti­cles stat­ing that the preser­va­tion of bread is one of the old­est forms of mak­ing beer. There­after, I had the idea of us­ing sur­plus bread and Googled the amount wasted in Sin­ga­pore and in the world. I was as­ton­ished and I made it my mis­sion to help re­duce it sig­nif­i­cantly.</p>
    <p>Q How do you wres­tle with food waste when it comes to you and your fam­ily?</p>
    <p>A My fam­ily is the ba­sis of what I do and why it was easy for me to start a com­pany like CRUST. My mum in­cor­po­rates to­day’s food waste at home into some­thing new to­mor­row so that we won’t waste food. She reuses pack­ag­ing ma­te­ri­als too, so I ba­si­cally grew up with that men­tal­ity and have im­ple­mented that within the com­pany.</p>
    <p>Q Why beer?</p>
    <p>A I started with beer be­cause it was what I had knowl­edge of and it was the most fun way to ap­proach food waste and the mar­ket. I have been home-brew­ing for a while, so nat­u­rally it was what I stuck to. How­ever, the com­pany has piv­oted to be­ing a food tech com­pany and will be bring­ing more prod­ucts or so­lu­tions into the mar­ket that are not just beer.</p>
    <p>Q Where do you get your sup­plies from?</p>
    <p>A Our sup­plies come from RedMart, Tiong Bahru Bak­ery, Sal­adS­top!, Bettr Barista, Alba and var­i­ous other restau­rants and bars.</p>
    <p>Q Apart from pro­duc­ing beer, what other things does CRUST do to cut food waste?</p>
    <p>A We are in­tro­duc­ing CROP into the mar­ket early next year. It is our line of non-al­co­holic bev­er­ages; we use sur­plus and ugly fruit and veg­eta­bles to cre­ate any­thing from so­das to juices, kom­buchas and pro­bi­otic drinks.</p>
    <p>So CRUST is where we use mainly grain wastage like bread, rice, quinoa and corn, while CROP is where we use fruit and veg­etable wastage. We even use some cof­fee and tea waste too.</p>
    <p>Q How has CRUST been af­fected by the Covid-19 pan­demic?</p>
    <p>A Just like ev­ery other food and bev­er­age place in Sin­ga­pore, we were hit hard. But we made the best of the sit­u­a­tion, and you can say that our real growth hap­pened dur­ing Covid-19. We cre­ated a Web store and started our own de­liv­ery plat­form to sur­vive dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker. From June, we started fo­cus­ing on be­com­ing a food tech com­pany. Our mis­sion is to re­duce global food waste by 1 per cent by 2030 and we needed to ex­pand into other prod­ucts and cat­e­gories in or­der to be able to in­crease our im­pact. CROP is the be­gin­ning of our jour­ney as a food tech com­pany.</p>
    <p>Q What’s in the pipe­line for the com­pany?</p>
    <p>A We are con­stantly do­ing re­search and de­vel­op­ment and are look­ing at mak­ing healthre­lated food and drinks from food waste. We launched CRUST Ja­pan re­cently, and are look­ing at do­ing the same in other mar­kets within Asia next year.</p>
