    <p>SEOUL • More than 40 per cent of new coro­n­avirus cases in South Korea are be­ing de­tected in peo­ple over the age of 60, con­tribut­ing in part to a surge in the num­ber of Covid-19 pa­tients who are se­verely or crit­i­cally ill, the health au­thor­i­ties said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>South Korea is bat­tling a sec­ond wave of in­fec­tion, cen­tred on the cap­i­tal Seoul and sur­round­ing ar­eas, which are home to 25 mil­lion peo­ple.</p>
    <p>The Korea Cen­tres for Dis­ease Con­trol and Pre­ven­tion re­ported 267 new cases as of mid­night on Tues­day, a slight in­crease over the day be­fore. Over­all, South Korea has re­ported 20,449 cases and 326 deaths.</p>
    <p>The num­ber of se­verely or crit­i­cally ill pa­tients stood at 124 yes­ter­day, Vice-Health Minister Kim Gang-lip told a brief­ing, from just nine re­ported on Aug 18.</p>
    <p>“The num­ber in crit­i­cal con­di­tion is steadily in­creas­ing,” he said.</p>
    <p>South Korea was the site of the first l arge out­break out­side of China ear­lier this year, but a large per­cent­age of those in­fected at the time were rel­a­tively young, pos­si­bly help­ing to keep the coun­try’s death toll rel­a­tively low, ex­perts have said.</p>
    <p>The health min­istry said the surge in cases over the past three weeks has de­pleted med­i­cal fa­cil­i­ties, with less than 3 per cent of hospi­tal beds – or just nine – avail­able for crit­i­cal cases in greater Seoul, ver­sus 22 per cent about 10 days ago.</p>
    <p>Mr Kim said the gov­ern­ment is work­ing to se­cure more beds in the ex­pec­ta­tion that the num­ber of se­vere cases will con­tinue to rise as many of the new pa­tients are aged above 60.</p>
    <p>Only so­cial dis­tanc­ing can bring the num­ber of new in­fec­tions down, he added, call­ing on res­i­dents to can­cel any trips and stay at home as much as pos­si­ble.</p>
    <p>So­cial dis­tanc­ing mea­sures im­posed to blunt the surge in coro­n­avirus cases will hurt Asia’s fourth­biggest econ­omy, the gov­ern­ment said on Tues­day, af­ter un­prece­dented re­stric­tions went into ef­fect in and around Seoul.</p>
    <p>Fi­nance Minister Hong Nam-ki said the gov­ern­ment and rul­ing party will need to pro­vide cash hand­outs to some house­holds as the tight­ened so­cial dis­tanc­ing pol­icy is caus­ing a down­turn in the econ­omy.</p>
    <p>“A tar­geted ap­proach will be more effective” to pro­vide the cash hand­out, rather than to pro­vide it to ev­ery house­hold, he said in a tele­vised in­ter­view on Tues­day night.</p>
    <p>The gov­ern­ment in May pro­vided cash hand­outs to ev­ery house­hold to ease the eco­nomic im­pact of the coro­n­avirus out­break.</p>
