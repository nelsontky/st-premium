    <p>We re­fer to the let­ters by Mr Daryl Yang Wei Jian (Root of sex of­fences lies in sex­ism, misog­yny, Dec 15) and Mr Paul Leow (Sys­tems, pro­ce­dures must be in place to en­sure stu­dents’ well-be­ing, Dec 11).</p>
    <p>Chil­dren in schools are be­ing ed­u­cated from a young age on how to treat ev­ery­one with re­spect. We do this through Char­ac­ter and Cit­i­zen­ship Ed­u­ca­tion (CCE).</p>
    <p>Sex­u­al­ity ed­u­ca­tion, which is part of CCE, equips our stu­dents with the nec­es­sary so­cial and emo­tional skills to de­velop pos­i­tive self-iden­tity, main­tain healthy re­la­tion­ships and make in­formed and re­spon­si­ble de­ci­sions on sex­u­al­ity mat­ters.</p>
    <p>For in­stance, in pri­mary schools, pupils are taught about per­sonal safety and pro­tec­tion from sex­ual ex­ploita­tion and abuse. In sec­ondary schools and ju­nior col­leges, there is a greater fo­cus on how to build healthy re­la­tion­ships. This in­cludes help­ing stu­dents bet­ter un­der­stand what it means to re­spect bound­aries for self and oth­ers.</p>
    <p>Stu­dents are taught about the so­cial-emo­tional, le­gal and dis­ci­plinary con­se­quences in schools if they over­step th­ese bound­aries so that they do not be­come per­pe­tra­tors them­selves.</p>
    <p>They are also taught how to seek help from trusted adults such as their par­ents, teach­ers and school coun­sel­lors when they are in need of sup­port, or when they think that their peers are be­ing ex­posed to harm or harm­ful in­flu­ences.</p>
    <p>The Min­istry of Ed­u­ca­tion re­views our sex­u­al­ity ed­u­ca­tion cur­ricu­lum reg­u­larly to en­sure its rel­e­vance and re­spon­sive­ness to the chang­ing needs of stu­dents as so­ci­ety evolves. As part of the re­cently up­dated CCE 2021 cur­ricu­lum, we are putting greater em­pha­sis on mo­ral val­ues, cy­ber well­ness and the im­por­tance of re­spect­ing bound­aries for self and oth­ers – both on­line and off­line.</p>
    <p>Sim­i­larly, at the in­sti­tutes of higher learn­ing, ed­u­ca­tion con­tin­ues to be the key con­duit through which we build an in­clu­sive and re­spect­ful cam­pus cul­ture. At plat­forms like stu­dent ori­en­ta­tion, on­line mod­ules, face-to-face work­shops and reg­u­lar out­reach, stu­dents are ed­u­cated on the im­por­tance of re­spect and ap­pro­pri­ate be­hav­iour. Stu­dents are also en­cour­aged and guided on how to tap the avail­able av­enues to seek pro­fes­sional help, such as from coun­sel­lors and vic­tim care units.</p>
    <p>Be­sides schools, par­ents also play a key role in nur­tur­ing our young so that they are em­pow­ered with the rel­e­vant knowl­edge and skills to pro­tect them­selves, and are in­stilled with the right val­ues to make in­formed de­ci­sions on sex­u­al­ity mat­ters. Tan Chen Kee</p>
