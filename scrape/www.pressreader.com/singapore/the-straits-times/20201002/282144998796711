    <p>The prose­cu­tion has urged a court to sen­tence a for­mer Sin­ga­pore Armed Forces (SAF) reg­u­lar to nine years’ jail with seven strokes of the cane af­ter he mo­lested a girl in Jan­uary 2018 and at­tempted to mo­lest another girl four months later.</p>
    <p>Deputy Pub­lic Pros­e­cu­tor Sruthi Bop­pana said yes­ter­day Mo­hamed Ardlee Iriandee Mo­hamed Sa­nip had com­mit­ted se­ri­ous of­fences. She also said Ardlee had tar­geted two young girls.</p>
    <p>De­fence lawyer Mo­hamed Muza­m­mil Mo­hamed pleaded for a lighter sen­tence, stat­ing that his client was un­der a pe­riod of stress when he com­mit­ted the of­fences.</p>
    <p>District Judge John Ng also heard that Ardlee had been di­ag­nosed with anx­i­ety and de­pres­sion.</p>
    <p>The 40-year-old Sin­ga­porean had ear­lier claimed trial, and on Feb 27, Judge Ng found him guilty of mo­lest­ing an eight-year-old girl in Jan­uary 2018.</p>
    <p>On March 23, Ardlee ad­mit­ted in court that he tried to mo­lest a 10-year-old girl in May that year. The two girls can­not be named due to a gag or­der.</p>
    <p>Court doc­u­ments did not dis­close Ardlee’s rank and role at the Safti Mil­i­tary In­sti­tute where he was based at the time of the of­fences. The Straits Times un­der­stands that he is no longer an SAF reg­u­lar.</p>
    <p>In her ear­lier sub­mis­sions, DPP Sruthi said Ardlee had de­vel­oped an in­ter­est in young girls a month be­fore tar­get­ing the first vic­tim and was “pre­dis­posed to thoughts of mo­lest­ing them, and had thought of do­ing so by wait­ing near pri­mary schools for op­por­tu­ni­ties”.</p>
    <p>The vic­tim and her friend were walk­ing back from school at around 3pm on Jan 22, 2018, when they saw Ardlee at a Tampines block where the friend’s grand­par­ents lived.</p>
    <p>The vic­tim ac­com­pa­nied her friend to the flat and was on her way to her own home when Ardlee grabbed her hand near a lift lobby and mo­lested her.</p>
    <p>He re­leased the girl only af­ter she told him to stop sev­eral times. She re­turned to the flat of her friend’s grand­par­ents and the po­lice were alerted.</p>
    <p>Later that year on May 21, Ardlee at­tempted to outrage the mod­esty of another girl in Choa Chu Kang at around 4pm.</p>
    <p>She was on her way home from school when she saw him at her block’s lift lobby. She en­tered the lift alone, but when she got to the sec­ond storey, he was stand­ing in front of the lift door.</p>
    <p>He then placed a hand on her shoul­der and pulled her to­wards the cor­ner of a stair­case land­ing area. The girl re­sisted and started scream­ing.</p>
    <p>Ardlee re­leased her and fled. The girl re­turned home and told her aunt about what hap­pened. Po­lice ar­rested him the next day.</p>
    <p>His bail was set at $30,000 yes­ter­day and he will be sen­tenced on Oct 27.</p>
