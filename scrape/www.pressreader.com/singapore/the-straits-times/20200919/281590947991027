    <p>Chil­dren in Sin­ga­pore are more anx­ious about ex­am­i­na­tions than about Covid-19, ac­cord­ing to a sur­vey. It found that 70 per cent of chil­dren polled felt neg­a­tively about up­com­ing ex­ams, with more than 60 per cent ad­mit­ting to be­ing “wor­ried”. In com­par­i­son, 60 per cent felt pos­i­tive – “calm”, “se­cure” or “hope­ful” – about the Covid-19 sit­u­a­tion in Sin­ga­pore. HOME</p>
    <p>Chil­dren in Sin­ga­pore are more anx­ious about ex­am­i­na­tions than about Covid-19, ac­cord­ing to a sur­vey out yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>It found that 70 per cent of chil­dren polled felt neg­a­tively about up­com­ing ex­ams – “an­gry”, “wor­ried” or “sad” – with more than 60 per cent ad­mit­ting to be­ing “wor­ried”.</p>
    <p>In com­par­i­son, 60 per cent felt pos­i­tive – “calm”, “se­cure” or “hope­ful” – about the Covid-19 sit­u­a­tion in Sin­ga­pore, noted char­ity Fo­cus on the Fam­ily Sin­ga­pore, which polled around 1,050 chil­dren aged be­tween 10 and 15.</p>
    <p>It said the find­ings sug­gest that ex­ams and grades are “of high im­por­tance”. “While it is nat­u­ral that ex­am­i­na­tions cause some anx­i­ety, high lev­els of worry can lead to test anx­i­ety if left unchecked.</p>
    <p>“This may, in turn, af­fect stu­dents’ aca­demic per­for­mance and lead to other forms of anx­i­ety, de­pres­sion or men­tal health is­sues.”</p>
    <p>Parental sup­port can help off­set the neg­a­tive ef­fects of test anx­i­ety, it added.</p>
    <p>The sur­vey noted that 38.1 per cent of the chil­dren ad­mit­ting to be­ing “wor­ried” about up­com­ing ex­ams in­di­cated that they do not re­ceive con­sis­tent parental sup­port.</p>
    <p>Ms Joanna Koh-Hoe, the char­ity’s chief ex­ec­u­tive, said: “It’s prob­a­bly no sur­prise that the sur­vey re­sults show that our chil­dren face tremen­dous pres­sure when it comes to their aca­demic per­for­mance.</p>
    <p>“They re­ally need their par­ents to tune in to their emo­tional needs and not just cater to their prac­ti­cal daily needs.”</p>
    <p>More than 70 per cent of chil­dren</p>
    <p>sur­veyed de­scribed them­selves as be­ing close to both their par­ents – rated “seven” and above on a 10-point scale – with boys and girls dif­fer­ing in ways they felt most con­nected and loved by each par­ent.</p>
    <p>Those 10 to 12 years old were also closer to their par­ents, com­pared with 13- to 15-year-olds.</p>
    <p>Boys seemed to value their chats with both par­ents most of all, fol­lowed by qual­ity time with their fa­thers through shared ac­tiv­i­ties and out­ings. They also en­joyed deeper con­ver­sa­tions with their moth­ers and the feel­ing of be­ing lis­tened to.</p>
    <p>Girls seemed to pre­fer their fa­thers for shared ac­tiv­i­ties and out­ings and their moth­ers for phys­i­cal and ver­bal af­fec­tion.</p>
    <p>The sur­vey was con­ducted from Aug 17 to Sept 7 as part of an an­nual Chil­dren’s Day cam­paign by Fo­cus on the Fam­ily Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>The Race to Praise cam­paign is in its sixth year and is one of a range of ef­forts to ad­dress men­tal health is­sues among chil­dren.</p>
