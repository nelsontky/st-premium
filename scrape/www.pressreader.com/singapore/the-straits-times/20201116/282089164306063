    <p>When she was 14, Ms Vic­to­ria Quek be­came the only care­giver to her sin­gle mum, who was bat­tling re­nal fail­ure.</p>
    <p>Then a stu­dent at Seran­goon Gar­den Sec­ondary School, the teen of­ten missed classes as she strug­gled to man­age her mother’s med­i­cal ap­point­ments and look after her two younger sis­ters.</p>
    <p>For three years, Ms Quek jug­gled her re­spon­si­bil­i­ties and stud­ied on her own when her mother had dial­y­sis ses­sions.</p>
    <p>Last November, her mother died at the age of 44.</p>
    <p>Ear­lier this month, Ms Quek, now 18 and a nurs­ing stu­dent at the In­sti­tute of Tech­ni­cal Ed­u­ca­tion, was lauded for her ef­forts at the an­nual Sin­ga­pore Pa­tient Ac­tion Awards.</p>
    <p>She re­ceived the Sin­ga­pore Pa­tient Care­giver Award after a so­cial worker who worked with the fam­ily nom­i­nated her.</p>
    <p>The award, said Ms Quek, felt like a val­i­da­tion of her ef­forts. “I never ex­pected to get an award, and it was quite sur­pris­ing to me. I felt happy – the award is a con­fir­ma­tion that I did some­thing right.”</p>
    <p>Be­fore she fell ill in 2017, Ms Quek’s mother was a free­lance lawyer. Ms Quek did not want to dis­cuss de­tails about her fa­ther.</p>
    <p>Re­fer­ring to her late mum, Ms Quek said: “She was both mother and fa­ther to us. She was a lev­el­headed and strong per­son. She suf­fered from a flesh-eat­ing in­fec­tion and kid­ney fail­ure, and we even feared she would need a trans­plant at the time.</p>
    <p>“I felt like I was run­ning on au­topi­lot, putting my stud­ies on hold be­cause, for me, my sib­lings’ stud­ies took pri­or­ity over mine. They were too young to stop school­ing.”</p>
    <p>She, her mum and her two sis­ters, who are now 14 and 16, be­came closer when her mum was sick.</p>
    <p>De­spite all that was go­ing on, Ms Quek passed her O-level ex­ams. It was while she was tak­ing care of her mother that she no­ticed the tire­less work done by the nurses at Tan Tock Seng Hospi­tal (TTSH).</p>
    <p>She said: “I learnt how to take care of my mother from the nurses, and they even told me I was a fast learner. I also re­alised they were far more hands-on in a pa­tient’s daily life com­pared with a doc­tor. That ap­pealed to me.”</p>
    <p>Their ded­i­ca­tion and duty of care in­flu­enced Ms Quek and led her to choose nurs­ing as a fu­ture ca­reer.</p>
    <p>Due to the Covid-19 pandemic, all award re­cip­i­ents took part in the cer­e­mony through a spe­cial video show­case that pre­miered at TTSH’s vir­tual Sin­ga­pore Pa­tient Con­fer­ence 2020 on Nov 6.</p>
    <p>Or­gan­ised by TTSH’s Cen­tre for Health Ac­ti­va­tion in part­ner­ship with Cen­tral Health, Na­tional Health­care Group, Na­tional Health­care Group Poly­clin­ics, In­sti­tute of Men­tal Health and Yishun Health, the con­fer­ence is a co-learn­ing and shar­ing plat­form for pa­tients, care­givers, vol­un­teers, com­mu­nity part­ners and health and so­cial care pro­fes­sion­als.</p>
