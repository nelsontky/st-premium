    <p>• Mauri­cio Po­chet­tino ad­mit­ted he was dis­ap­pointed not to have won his first match as Paris Saint-Ger­main coach af­ter a 1-1 draw at Saint-Eti­enne on Wed­nes­day, as his new team slipped three points be­hind Ligue 1 l ead­ers Lyon.</p>
    <p>The cham­pi­ons fell be­hind early to Ro­main Hamouma’s strike be­fore Moise Kean lev­elled soon af­ter, but laboured in the sec­ond half.</p>
    <p>“Of course I’m dis­ap­pointed be­cause we’re PSG, we want to win,” Po­chet­tino told Tele­foot. “But I’m happy with the ef­fort made by the play­ers, by their at­ti­tude.</p>
    <p>“It was a dif­fi­cult game. We need to keep work­ing. I’m not look­ing for ex­cuses, we need to im­prove the way we play and to im­prove our per­for­mances.”</p>
    <p>The for­mer Tot­ten­ham boss was con­firmed as Thomas Tuchel’s suc­ces­sor only l ast Satur­day, four days af­ter the Ger­man’s sack­ing was of­fi­cially an­nounced. But the scale of the task fac­ing the for­mer PSG de­fender was laid out in front of him at the Ge­of­froy Sta­dium as the cap­i­tal-city giants’ ti­tle de­fence suf­fered another blow.</p>
    <p>“This is j ust the be­gin­ning,” added the 48-year-old Po­chet­tino. “We have to get to know each other. It was dif­fi­cult be­cause the prepa­ra­tion was too short.</p>
    <p>“It’s pos­i­tive but there are things to im­prove.”</p>
    <p>PSG en­joyed 68 per cent of pos­ses­sion, but in the ab­sence of Ney­mar, re­cov­er­ing from an an­kle in­jury, lacked stamina and in­spi­ra­tion while Kylian Mbappe had yet another match to for­get.</p>
    <p>Marco Ver­ratti, po­si­tioned high up on the pitch as a play­maker, was de­ci­sive for PSG’s goal but the Italy mid­fielder was oth­er­wise as unin­spired as the rest of the team.</p>
    <p>Lyon sur­vived a late Lens come­back to ex­tend their lead with a 3-2 win, with Mem­phis De­pay’s dou­ble proving cru­cial.</p>
    <p>PSG did move into sec­ond on 36 points, above Lille on goal dif­fer­ence, af­ter Christophe Galtier’s team slipped to a sur­prise 2-1 home loss to Angers.</p>
    <p>For­mer France coach Ray­mond Domenech’s reign at 17th-placed Nantes started with a drab goal­less draw against fourth-placed Rennes.</p>
    <p>“We have laid the first stone,” said Domenech, who led France to the 2006 World Cup fi­nal.</p>
    <p>“Now we must con­tinue to im­prove.”</p>
