    <p>All sur­vivors and res­cue work­ers in­volved in the plane crash in Ker­ala on Fri­day are be­ing tested for Covid-19, as one of the pas­sen­gers killed tested pos­i­tive for the virus.</p>
    <p>The Air In­dia Ex­press plane, on a repa­tri­a­tion flight from Dubai car­ry­ing 190 on board, over­shot the run­way while land­ing at Cali­cut In­ter­na­tional Air­port in Kozhikode in heavy rain and crashed into a small gorge, split­ting into two.</p>
    <p>Nine­teen peo­ple, in­clud­ing a four-year-old, the pi­lot and co-pi­lot, have died. At least 23 oth­ers are in crit­i­cal con­di­tion.</p>
    <p>Mr Sharafu Pi­lassery, a pas­sen­ger who died on Fri­day night, had posted a photo of his fam­ily in face shields and white pro­tec­tive body­suits on Face­book just be­fore the flight took off from Dubai. “Back to home,” he had writ­ten. Of­fi­cials said Mr Pi­lassery’s wife is sta­ble, but their three-year-old daugh­ter is in crit­i­cal care.</p>
    <p>Most of the pas­sen­gers were peo­ple who had lost jobs, had ex­pired visas or needed emer­gency med­i­cal treat­ment. They had been on a wait­ing list to re­turn home for weeks.</p>
    <p>The state gov­ern­ment of­fered one mil­lion ru­pees (S$18,300) each to the vic­tims’ fam­i­lies and will bear the med­i­cal ex­penses of all sur­vivors.</p>
    <p>Much of the res­cue work was done by lo­cals. Mr Muhammed Rafi from Ko­du­vally town near the air­port said he called for help as soon as he heard the crash. “Within 11/ hours, we helped to ad­mit all in­jured pas</p>
    <p>2 sen­gers in nearby hos­pi­tals,” he said.</p>
    <p>State Health Min­is­ter K.K. Shailaja said Covid-19 tests were con­ducted on the dead be­fore au­top­sies were car­ried out.</p>
    <p>Ker­ala Chief Min­is­ter Pi­narayi Vi­jayan said a pas­sen­ger who died in the crash tested pos­i­tive for Covid-19. All sur­vivors and res­cue work­ers should thus go into self-quar­an­tine and will be tested, he added.</p>
    <p>The black box and cock­pit voice recorder have been re­cov­ered from the wreck­age and will be sent to Delhi, said In­dian Civil Avi­a­tion Min­is­ter Harshdeep Singh Puri. The Air­craft Ac­ci­dent In­ves­ti­ga­tion Bureau will con­duct a probe into the Boe­ing 737’s crash.</p>
    <p>In­dia’s worst crash since 2010 has trig­gered ques­tions about the safety of the air­port’s short run­way.</p>
    <p>The heavy down­pour could have made the plane skid, said a Kozhikode dis­trict of­fi­cial in charge of res­cues. Ker­ala saw tor­ren­tial rain last week, and land­slides have killed 24 peo­ple.</p>
    <p>The Kozhikode “table­top” air­port is on a hill with a run­way that stops al­most at the cliff edge. Cap­tain Mo­han Ran­ganathan, a civil avi­a­tion ex­pert who pre­vi­ously in­spected the air­port, said it was “tailor-made for dis­as­ter”. But Direc­torate Gen­eral of Civil Avi­a­tion chief Arun Ku­mar told CNN-News18 that “the run­way was long enough for safe land­ing” and “there was poor judg­ment of pi­lots while land­ing”.</p>
