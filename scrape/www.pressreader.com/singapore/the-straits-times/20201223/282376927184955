    <p>• Oil prices dropped al­most 2 per cent yes­ter­day to be­low US$50 a bar­rel, adding to losses from the pre­vi­ous ses­sion, as a new coro­n­avirus strain in the United King­dom re­vived con­cerns over de­mand re­cov­ery.</p>
    <p>The de­tec­tion of the new strain prompted sev­eral coun­tries to close their bor­ders to Bri­tain, although a Bri­tish min­is­ter said the UK and France are work­ing to re­open one of Europe’s most im­por­tant trade routes.</p>
    <p>Brent crude was down 72 US cents, or 1.4 per cent to US$50.19 a bar­rel at 0915 GMT (5.15pm Sin­ga­pore time), while US West Texas In­ter­me­di­ate (WTI) crude fell 76 US cents, or 1.6 per cent, to US$47.21.</p>
    <p>Both bench­marks slid nearly 3 per cent on Mon­day, partly eras­ing re­cent gains driven by the roll-out of Covid-19 vac­cines seen as key to al­low­ing a re­turn to nor­mal life.</p>
    <p>“In the bat­tle between im­me­di­ate neg­a­tive con­cerns and fu­ture op­ti­mism, the for­mer is now fight­ing back,” said Mr Ta­mas Varga of oil bro­ker PVM.</p>
    <p>The lat­est rally cul­mi­nated in Brent hit­ting US$52.48, its high­est since March, on Fri­day. Some see po­ten­tial for prices to fall fur­ther.</p>
    <p>Mr Jef­frey Hal­ley of bro­ker­age Oanda said: “The en­vi­ron­ment re­mains de­cid­edly risk-averse. Given the scale of oil’s two-month rally, a deeper cor­rec­tion can­not be ruled out.”</p>
    <p>Oil gained sup­port from the United States Congress ap­prov­ing a US$892 bil­lion (S$1.2 tril­lion) coro­n­avirus aid pack­age af­ter months of in­ac­tion. In fo­cus will be the lat­est US oil in­ven­tory re­ports, ex­pected to show crude stocks fell by 3.3 mil­lion bar­rels.</p>
    <p>The Amer­i­can Pe­tro­leum In­sti­tute’s re­port is due at 2130 GMT.</p>
    <p>The Or­gan­i­sa­tion of the Pe­tro­leum Ex­port­ing Coun­tries and al­lies are set to boost out­put by 500,000 bar­rels per day next month.</p>
    <p>There is no sign yet of any wa­ver­ing in­duced by the price drop. Rus­sian Deputy Prime Min­is­ter Alexan­der No­vak said on Mon­day that the rise in out­put should not re­sult in a glut.</p>
    <p>Crude has surged more than 30 per cent since the end of Oc­to­ber, in part due to a se­ries of vac­cine break­throughs. The threat to de­mand from ad­di­tional stay-ath­ome mea­sures is push­ing Brent con­tracts for prompt de­liv­ery back into a dis­count against later de­liv­er­ies – a bear­ish pat­tern known as con­tango.</p>
