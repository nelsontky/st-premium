    <p>Sin­ga­pore is mon­i­tor­ing stud­ies on the ef­fec­tive­ness of the Covid-19 vac­cines, and will con­sider re­lax­ing stay-home mea­sures for vac­ci­nated trav­ellers if the shots sig­nif­i­cantly curb the spread of the dis­ease, said Ed­u­ca­tion Min­is­ter Lawrence Wong.</p>
    <p>But for now, the Govern­ment will con­tinue to take a cau­tious ap­proach, and vac­ci­nated trav­ellers will con­tinue to be sub­ject to the same bor­der mea­sures and stay-home re­quire­ments as non-vac­ci­nated trav­ellers, added Mr Wong, who co-chairs the multi-min­istry task force on Covid-19.</p>
    <p>His re­marks came amid the roll-out of vac­ci­na­tions in some coun­tries, in­clud­ing Sin­ga­pore, af­ter govern­ments around the world ap­proved the emer­gency use of sev­eral newly de­vel­oped vac­cines.</p>
    <p>But it is un­clear how this might im­pact travel, since much is still not known about how much the vac­cines can re­duce trans­mis­sion and in­fec­tion, and how long their ef­fects will last.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, Ms Foo Mee Har (West Coast GRC) asked if vac­ci­na­tion may be­come a key re­quire­ment for travel to Sin­ga­pore in fu­ture and how it might fea­ture at the up­com­ing World Eco­nomic Fo­rum slated to be held here in May.</p>
    <p>Giv­ing up­dates on Covid-19 in a min­is­te­rial state­ment, Mr Wong said that while vac­cines ben­e­fit those who have been im­mu­nised, there is still not enough clar­ity on how they pro­tect oth­ers from the Sars-CoV-2 virus.</p>
    <p>The Govern­ment is closely mon­i­tor­ing sev­eral on­go­ing stud­ies on how ef­fec­tive the vac­cines are in this re­spect.</p>
    <p>When there is clear ev­i­dence that the risks of trans­mis­sion can be low­ered sig­nif­i­cantly by the use of vac­cines, Sin­ga­pore will be open to ad­just­ing mea­sures im­posed on trav­ellers, said Mr Wong.</p>
    <p>He added that while the Govern­ment may not re­quire trav­ellers to be vac­ci­nated, those who are may be sub­ject to re­laxed stay-home con­di­tions when they re­turn from over­seas, for in­stance.</p>
    <p>As for the World Eco­nomic Fo­rum, those trav­el­ling here to at­tend the meet­ing will be sub­ject to pre­vail­ing mea­sures, un­less new data on vac­cines has emerged by then, he said.</p>
