    <p>On Tues­day, for­mer World Bank pres­i­dent Robert Zoel­lick caused a stir when he said re­la­tions be­tween Wash­ing­ton and Bei­jing were in a “free fall” and may es­ca­late into a mil­i­tary con­fronta­tion with se­ri­ous im­pli­ca­tions.</p>
    <p>“The re­la­tion­ship right now is in free fall. It’s quite dan­ger­ous,” he said at an event spon­sored by the Peter­son In­sti­tute for In­ter­na­tional Eco­nomics, adding: “Peo­ple need to be aware that mis­cal­cu­la­tions can hap­pen, and is­sues with</p>
    <p>Tai­wan and oth­ers can move to a dan­ger zone.”</p>
    <p>Is his as­sess­ment right? Will the US and China go to war?</p>
    <p>As re­flected by Mr Zoel­lick, a for­mer White House, State and Trea­sury se­nior of­fi­cial, and then a Har­vard Uni­ver­sity se­nior fel­low, the in­ter­na­tional com­mu­nity is con­cerned by the wors­en­ing re­la­tion­ship be­tween the two most im­por­tant coun­tries in the world.</p>
    <p>The ex­perts used to say war be­tween China and the US was in­con­ceiv­able. But some ex­perts are now say­ing it is con­ceiv­able. To un­der­stand what has gone so badly wrong with this re­la­tion­ship, we need to look back at his­tory.</p>
    <p>THREE HIS­TOR­I­CAL PHASES</p>
    <p>The re­la­tion­ship be­tween the US and the Peo­ple’s Repub­lic of China (PRC) can be di­vided into three his­tor­i­cal phases.</p>
    <p>The first phase was be­tween 1949 and 1972. In the Chi­nese Civil War, the US sup­ported the Kuom­intang (KMT) against the Chi­nese Com­mu­nist Party (CCP). When the KMT was de­feated, the US helped the gov­ern­ment and armed forces of the Repub­lic of China (KMT) to re­lo­cate from the main­land to Tai­wan. The US also helped to de­fend Tai­wan.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing this pe­riod, the PRC and the US saw each other as en­e­mies. The low­est point in their re­la­tion­ship was dur­ing the Korean War. The US sup­ported South</p>
    <p>Korea and the PRC sup­ported</p>
    <p>North Korea. This was the one and only oc­ca­sion on which the armed forces of the two coun­tries clashed. The fight­ing ended in a stale­mate and cease­fire.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing this 23-year pe­riod, each side tried to de­monise the other. There were no trade or diplo­matic re­la­tions be­tween them.</p>
    <p>Phase two was from 1972 to 2016. In 1972, then US Pres­i­dent Richard Nixon shocked the world by go­ing to Bei­jing to talk to Chair­man Mao Ze­dong and</p>
    <p>Premier Zhou En­lai.</p>
    <p>Why did the US do a 180-de­gree turn in its China pol­icy? Nixon’s ob­jec­tive was to forge an al­liance with China against the Soviet Union.</p>
    <p>The two erst­while en­e­mies joined forces to fight a com­mon en­emy. There is a say­ing that my en­emy’s en­emy is my friend. For both the US and China, the No. 1 en­emy was the Soviet Union. This was a mar­riage of con­ve­nience. The two coun­tries might have been sleep­ing in the same bed but they had dif­fer­ent dreams.</p>
    <p>Apart from op­pos­ing the Soviet Union, the pol­icy of the US was to bring China out of iso­la­tion. The agenda was to so­cialise China and in­te­grate it into the in­ter­na­tional com­mu­nity, in­clud­ing join­ing the World Trade Or­gan­i­sa­tion. The Amer­i­can hope was that China would even­tu­ally be­come a re­spon­si­ble stake­holder. The Amer­i­can ex­pec­ta­tion was that China would be sub­or­di­nate to the US and not chal­lenge US hege­mony.</p>
    <p>The Chi­nese leader, Deng Xiaop­ing, was a black swan. No one could have ex­pected that the CCP could pro­duce a leader who would have the courage and power to put an end to the in­ef­fi­cient cen­trally planned econ­omy. For a com­mu­nist, this was noth­ing less than killing one of the ide­ol­ogy’s most sa­cred cows.</p>
    <p>Deng’s de­ci­sion, in 1978, to em­bark on re­form and open the</p>
    <p>Chi­nese econ­omy to the world, would change the for­tune of China. The progress which China has made in the past 40 years is his­tor­i­cally un­prece­dented. It has trans­formed China, from a poor, back­ward and weak coun­try into a strong, modern and rich coun­try. No Amer­i­can, in 1972 or 1978, could have imag­ined that China would be­come the world’s sec­ond-largest econ­omy and is pro­jected to over­take the US and be­come the world’s largest econ­omy.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing the 44 years from Nixon’s visit to 2016, the re­la­tion­ship be­tween the two coun­tries was fun­da­men­tally sta­ble and peace­ful. The two coun­tries co­op­er­ated when their in­ter­ests con­verged and com­peted when they di­verged. When dif­fi­cul­ties arose, they were able to deal with them, through give and take, without dis­rupt­ing the whole re­la­tion­ship. How­ever, trou­ble was brew­ing.</p>
    <p>We are now in the third phase of re­la­tions, which be­gan in 2016.</p>
    <p>Things have changed: The orig­i­nal rea­son for the al­liance be­tween the US and China had dis­ap­peared with the end of the Cold War. Their com­mon en­emy, the Soviet Union, was gone.</p>
    <p>Their bi­lat­eral re­la­tion­ship has evolved, from one be­tween a rich, pow­er­ful coun­try and a poor, weak coun­try to one be­tween two ap­prox­i­mate equals.</p>
    <p>They are not yet equal, eco­nom­i­cally or mil­i­tar­ily. The US’ per capita in­come is six times higher than that of China. US mil­i­tary power is without peer. China is not yet a su­per­power.</p>
    <p>How­ever, as China’s power in­creases and the gap be­tween them nar­rows, the Chi­nese would nat­u­rally be more as­sertive and less will­ing to play the role of a sub­or­di­nate. Since the 2008</p>
    <p>Bei­jing Olympic Games, China has dis­carded Deng’s ad­vice to keep a low pro­file and to hide its strength. Many Chi­nese feel very proud of their coun­try’s achieve­ments. They feel that their dream of a rich China with a strong mil­i­tary has come true. They want China to play a lead­ing role in the world.</p>
    <p>China has shown its global am­bi­tions by launch­ing the Asian In­fra­struc­ture In­vest­ment Bank and the Belt and Road Ini­tia­tive, both op­posed by the US, which saw them as build­ing blocks for Pax Sinica to re­place Pax Amer­i­cana.</p>
    <p>US BILL OF COM­PLAINTS</p>
    <p>It is clear the US has be­come dis­en­chanted with China, see­ing it as a com­peti­tor and chal­lenger in­stead of friend and part­ner.</p>
    <p>Why is this so?</p>
    <p>The Amer­i­can bill of com­plaints against China is long and var­ied. It in­cludes dis­af­fec­tion over trade re­la­tions, eco­nomic con­cerns, ac­cu­sa­tions of theft of tech­nol­ogy, sus­pi­cion of cy­ber­crime, in­tel­lec­tual prop­erty rights, ide­ol­ogy, hu­man rights, reli­gious free­dom, the South China Sea,</p>
    <p>Hong Kong, Tai­wan, Xin­jiang, the rule of law and so on.</p>
    <p>The Chi­nese view is that the crit­i­cisms are un­founded and em­anate from a US pol­icy to con­tain China and pre­vent the fur­ther rise of China.</p>
    <p>It is hard to es­cape the con­clu­sion that the US and China are en­gaged in a geopo­lit­i­cal con­test for in­flu­ence in Asia and the world. The dan­ger is that the con­test may be­come vi­o­lent. The one hot spot that could pro­voke an armed con­flict be­tween China and the US is Tai­wan. If the Peo­ple’s Lib­er­a­tion Army were to at­tempt to “re­cover” Tai­wan by force, this could lead to the in­volve­ment of US armed forces. If the lead­ers of Tai­wan were to seek de jure in­de­pen­dence and if Wash­ing­ton were to sup­port such a move, this could lead to a war be­tween the two great pow­ers.</p>
    <p>An­other hot spot is the South China Sea. The US has an­nounced that Chi­nese claims to the rocks and reefs and the wa­ters, en­closed by the nine-dash line in a Chi­nese map, are il­le­gal. The US has called upon China to com­ply with in­ter­na­tional law, in­clud­ing the UN Con­ven­tion on the Law of the Sea, and the rul­ing of the South China Sea arbitral tri­bunal of July 2016.</p>
    <p>China as­serts that its claims are con­sis­tent with in­ter­na­tional law and it re­jects the rul­ing of the arbitral tri­bunal. The US Navy has con­ducted and will con­tinue to con­duct the so-called free­dom of nav­i­ga­tion op­er­a­tions to de­fend in­ter­na­tional law and to re­ject China’s claims. There is a dan­ger that the two coun­tries’ navies may clash and things could spi­ral out of con­trol.</p>
    <p>A war be­tween China and the US would be dis­as­trous for both coun­tries and for the world. Since the two coun­tries pos­sess nu­clear weapons and have a sec­ond-strike ca­pa­bil­ity, a nu­clear war be­tween them would lead to mu­tual as­sured de­struc­tion. There would be no win­ners.</p>
    <p>DAN­GER­OUS MO­MENT</p>
    <p>Like Mr Zoel­lick, I think we live in a dan­ger­ous mo­ment of his­tory.</p>
    <p>An in­cum­bent su­per­power, the United States, is faced with a ris­ing chal­lenger, China. Ac­cord­ing to Pro­fes­sor Gra­ham Al­li­son, au­thor of the ex­cel­lent book, Des­tined For War: Can Amer­ica And China Es­cape Thucy­dides’s Trap?, in the past 500 years, there has been 16 in­stances when this oc­curred. Ac­cord­ing to him, in 12 cases, the re­sult was war. Let us hope that wis­dom will pre­vail in Wash­ing­ton and Bei­jing and war can be avoided.</p>
    <p>My own con­clu­sion is that war be­tween them is no longer in­con­ceiv­able but is un­likely. It is un­likely be­cause war will lead to the de­struc­tion of both coun­tries.</p>
    <p>How­ever, we may be at the be­gin­ning of a long strug­gle be­tween the US and China for global lead­er­ship.</p>
    <p>Un­like my good friend, Pro­fes­sor Kishore Mah­bubani, au­thor of a new book, Has China Won?, I don’t think the US would ever ac­cept be­ing No. 2. Hav­ing spent many years of my life in Amer­ica, I be­lieve that it is not in the coun­try’s char­ac­ter and psy­che to ac­cept be­ing No. 2 to any other coun­try. The fu­ture is there­fore un­pre­dictable.</p>
    <p>The one hot spot that could pro­voke an armed con­flict be­tween China and the US is Tai­wan. If the Peo­ple’s Lib­er­a­tion Army were to at­tempt to “re­cover” Tai­wan by force, this could lead to the in­volve­ment of US armed forces. If the lead­ers of Tai­wan were to seek de jure in­de­pen­dence and if Wash­ing­ton were to sup­port such a move, this could lead to a war be­tween the two great pow­ers.</p>

        <p data-role="text">US Navy air&#xAD;craft car&#xAD;rier USS Nimitz be&#xAD;ing re&#xAD;fu&#xAD;elled in the South China Sea last month. The US con&#xAD;sid&#xAD;ers Chi&#xAD;nese claims to the wa&#xAD;ters en&#xAD;closed by the nine-dash line in a Chi&#xAD;nese map to be il&#xAD;le&#xAD;gal, while China as&#xAD;serts that its claims are con&#xAD;sis&#xAD;tent with in&#xAD;ter&#xAD;na&#xAD;tional law. As the US Navy con&#xAD;ducts its so-called free&#xAD;dom of nav&#xAD;i&#xAD;ga&#xAD;tion op&#xAD;er&#xAD;a&#xAD;tions in the wa&#xAD;ters, there is a dan&#xAD;ger that the two coun&#xAD;tries&#x2019; navies may clash and things could spi&#xAD;ral out of con&#xAD;trol.</p>
