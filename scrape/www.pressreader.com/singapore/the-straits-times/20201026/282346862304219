    <p>Since 2016, The Straits Times Run has been a yearly event for Ping Yi Sec­ondary School, and this year was no dif­fer­ent even though the run was con­verted to a vir­tual one ow­ing to the Covid-19 pan­demic.</p>
    <p>To spice things up, the school turned t he vir­tual run i nto a friendly com­pe­ti­tion among its four stu­dent houses: An­des, Rock­ies, At­las and Alpine.</p>
    <p>The 20 stu­dents who took part in The Straits Times Vir­tual Run’s (STVR) 17.5km cat­e­gory were ranked by their pace and awarded points ac­cord­ing to their rank­ing.</p>
    <p>Alpine House emerged as win­ners. Yong Tze Woon, Ping Yi’s head of depart­ment for phys­i­cal ed­u­ca­tion and co-cur­ric­u­lar ac­tiv­i­ties, ex­plained that the school de­cided to come back for the run this year to en­cour­age stu­dents to stay ac­tive.</p>
    <p>He said: “This year is spe­cial be­cause of the Covid-19 sit­u­a­tion. We see a lot of stu­dents are less fit. Some put on a bit of weight, so we wanted some ac­tiv­i­ties to come back. The Straits Times Run has al­ways been a fea­ture of our pro­gramme be­cause we be­lieve in do­ing some­thing for a cause (a por­tion of reg­is­tra­tion fees goes to The Straits Times School Pocket Money Fund), so we used this as a chance to ed­u­cate the stu­dents about giv­ing back to the com­mu­nity.”</p>
    <p>The school has also come up with its own ini­tia­tive named Ping Yi Walk Run Chal­lenge, which started on Aug 3 and will last till the end of this year, to en­cour­age stu­dents and staff to keep ac­tive.</p>
    <p>Sec­ondary 3 stu­dent Ravi Raveena used to run at least 2km a day, but stopped ex­er­cis­ing reg­u­larly dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker pe­riod. The STVR was an op­por­tu­nity for the 15-year-old to re­gain her fitness, split­ting the 17.5km into four runs of 5km each. She was also ex­cited to rep­re­sent An­des House.</p>
    <p>“Dur­ing the lock­down, I just stayed at home and com­pletely for­got about be­ing healthy so when my teacher said there was this run, I signed up for it,” said Raveena, who ran with two friends.</p>
    <p>“It was hard in the be­gin­ning be­cause I hadn’t ex­er­cised for so long, but my friends and teacher mo­ti­vated me to fin­ish this.”</p>
    <p>While the stu­dents had over two weeks to com­plete the dis­tance, At­las House rep­re­sen­ta­tive Dex­ter Lee, whose long­est run till that point had been 5km, was mo­ti­vated to com­plete the dis­tance in one at­tempt to help his house get points.</p>
    <p>Although his legs felt sore and he strug­gled with stitches, the Sec­ondary 3 stu­dent cov­ered the 17.5km at Be­dok Reser­voir in close to two hours.</p>
    <p>He said: “It was such a long dis­tance, I don’t think my friends have done it be­fore, it felt spe­cial.”</p>
    <p>The race pe­riod for STVR’s 17.5km cat­e­gory was from Oct 9-23. The 175km event started on Oct 19 and will end on Dec 17.</p>
