    <p>YANGON • An armed group i n Myan­mar’s con­flict-wracked Rakhine state has re­leased three mem­bers of Aung San Suu Kyi’s rul­ing party, who were kid­napped ahead of Novem­ber’s elec­tion.</p>
    <p>The Arakan Army (AA) has for nearly two years been locked in bat­tle with Myan­mar’s mil­i­tary, fight­ing for more au­ton­omy for the state’s eth­nic Rakhine pop­u­la­tion.</p>
    <p>Both sides stand ac­cused of rights abuses, with hun­dreds killed or in­jured and some 200,000 civil­ians forced to flee their homes in an area un­der a strict lock­down – mak­ing in­de­pen­dent re­port­ing all but im­pos­si­ble.</p>
    <p>In Oc­to­ber – weeks be­fore an elec­tion that Ms Suu Kyi’s Na­tional League for Democ­racy (NLD) was ex­pected to win na­tion­wide – gun­men de­scended on a cam­paign event i n Taung­gok town­ship i n south­ern Rakhine and ab­ducted three par­lia­men­tary can­di­dates.</p>
    <p>Ac­cus­ing the NLD of “col­lab­o­rat­ing and cov­er­ing up war crimes com­mit­ted by the Myan­mar Army”, the AA said the as­pir­ing leg­is­la­tors would be freed only if those “detained un­law­fully” by the govern­ment and the army were re­leased.</p>
    <p>On Fri­day, “af­ter dis­cus­sions”, the trio were freed along with three soldiers also held by the AA, said Myan­mar’s army – known in Burmese as the Tat­madaw.</p>
    <p>“This af­ter­noon, AA handed them to the Tat­madaw team on duty... and they were safely taken by army he­li­copter to (Rakhine state’s cap­i­tal) Sit­twe,” an army state­ment said.</p>
    <p>The mil­i­tant group confirmed the release, adding that the three NLD mem­bers were kid­napped “for the pur­pose of war, politics and rev­o­lu­tion”. It also called for scores of Rakhine politi­cians and civil­ians – in­clud­ing AA mem­bers – to be freed.</p>
    <p>The western state has long been a hot­bed of con­flict.</p>
    <p>Since the AA stepped up at­tacks on the mil­i­tary in 2018, Rakhine civil­ians and vil­lage chiefs sus­pected of be­ing i nvolved have been ar­rested, while fam­ily mem­bers of prom­i­nent AA fig­ures were also detained.</p>
    <p>Ahead of the Novem­ber polls, the elec­tion com­mis­sion said se­cu­rity con­cerns meant the vote would be can­celled across swathes of the coun­try, in­clud­ing much of Rakhine.</p>
    <p>The move trig­gered fury from a mi­nor­ity group which has long felt marginalis­ed by the coun­try’s eth­nic Ba­mar ma­jor­ity, and also raised ques­tions about the vote’s cred­i­bil­ity.</p>
    <p>As ex­pected, Ms Suu Kyi’s rul­ing party swept the elec­tion in a land­slide win.</p>
    <p>But i n Taung­gok town­ship, where the three ab­ducted can­di­dates were sup­posed to stand, the Arakan Na­tional Party – a hard­line na­tion­al­ist party for eth­nic Rakhine – took vic­tory.</p>
