    <p>LON­DON • Arsenal winger Ni­co­las Pepe has apol­o­gised af­ter be­ing sent off for head­but­ting Leeds de­fender Ezg­jan Alioski in Sun­day’s goal-less draw i n the Premier League.</p>
    <p>He was red-carded in the 51st minute af­ter VAR (video as­sis­tant ref­eree) of­fi­cials spot­ted the in­ci­dent.</p>
    <p>“I let my team down at a cru­cial time of the game and there are no ex­cuses for my be­hav­iour,” the 25-year-old Ivory Coast in­ter­na­tional wrote on In­sta­gram.</p>
    <p>“I am deeply sorry and would like to apol­o­gise to the fans, my team­mates, my coach and ev­ery­one else at the club.”</p>
    <p>Pepe and Mace­do­nian Alioski were racially abused on so­cial me­dia, and Arsenal and Leeds said they would work with the au­thor­i­ties to trace those re­spon­si­ble.</p>
    <p>“We ut­terly con­demn the vile abuse directed at Ni­co­las Pepe and Ezg­jan Alioski on so­cial me­dia fol­low­ing our match against Leeds United,” the Gun­ners said in a state­ment.</p>
    <p>“This is com­pletely un­ac­cept­able and we will be work­ing with the po­lice and au­thor­i­ties to do ev­ery­thing we can to trace and pros­e­cute the culprits.”</p>
    <p>Leeds re­leased a sim­i­lar state­ment, say­ing they would not tol­er­ate such abuse.</p>
    <p>Pepe will miss Arsenal’s next three Premier League matches against Wolves, Tot­ten­ham and Burn­ley but could fea­ture in tomorrow’s Europa League game at Molde.</p>
