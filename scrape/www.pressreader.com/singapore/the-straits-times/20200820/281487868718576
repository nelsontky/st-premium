    <p>Nearly three times as many house­holds re­ceived help with mort­gage pay­ments from April to June this year than in the same pe­riod last year, the Hous­ing Board told The Straits Times yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>A to­tal of 1,356 house­holds in fi­nan­cial dif­fi­cul­ties were as­sisted by the HDB dur­ing the se­cond quar­ter of this year, com­pared with 517 house­holds last year, as Sin­ga­pore­ans grap­ple with the eco­nomic im­pact of Covid-19.</p>
    <p>Two-thirds of the house­holds asked to de­fer their loan in­stal­ments or to pay their loan ar­rears by in­stal­ments. The re­main­ing house­holds re­ceived other forms of as­sis­tance.</p>
    <p>A to­tal of 1,356 house­holds who could not meet their monthly mort­gage pay­ments re­ceived help from the Hous­ing Board (HDB) from April to June this year, as Sin­ga­pore­ans grap­pled with the eco­nomic im­pact of the Covid-19 out­break.</p>
    <p>The fig­ure is nearly a three­fold in­crease from the 517 house­holds who found them­selves in sim­i­lar cir­cum­stances dur­ing the same pe­riod last year.</p>
    <p>Of the 1,356 house­holds as­sisted, two-thirds re­quested to de­fer their loan in­stal­ments or pay their loan ar­rears by in­stal­ment, HDB said yes­ter­day, in re­sponse to e-mail queries from The Straits Times.</p>
    <p>The re­main­ing one-third of house­holds re­ceived other forms of as­sis­tance, in­clud­ing the ex­ten­sion of their mort­gage loan ten­ure to help re­duce monthly in­stal­ments.</p>
    <p>Taxi driver Ed­win Leong was among those who re­ceived as­sis­tance. He had de­faulted on two months of his hous­ing loan by the time he called HDB for fi­nan­cial as­sis­tance in April.</p>
    <p>The 41-year-old said his in­come plunged by more than half when Sin­ga­pore went into a stand­still dur­ing the two-month cir­cuit breaker pe­riod.</p>
    <p>“I was quite wor­ried about the late fees and fu­ture pay­ments, so I just de­cided to call HDB to try my luck and see if they can help me,” said Mr Leong, the sole bread­win­ner and fa­ther to two chil­dren aged 10 and 13. His fam­ily lives in a five­room HDB flat in Choa Chu Kang.</p>
    <p>Mr Leong opted to re­duce his $670 monthly HDB loan in­stal­ment for six months till De­cem­ber and is now pay­ing 40 per cent less than what he used to pay.</p>
    <p>“The few hun­dred dol­lars has helped to lighten my load, so I’m not so stressed. Hope­fully the Covid-19 sit­u­a­tion is bet­ter by De­cem­ber, if not, I’m also not sure what to do,” he said.</p>
    <p>One of the re­lief mea­sures to help Sin­ga­pore­ans through Covid-19 was the sus­pen­sion of late pay­ment charges on HDB mort­gage ar­rears for three months from April to June. It was fur­ther ex­tended for an­other three months to the end of Septem­ber.</p>
    <p>The cur­rent late pay­ment charges is 7.5 per cent per an­num based on the out­stand­ing in­stal­ment amount at the end of the month.</p>
    <p>Banks and fi­nance com­pa­nies have also been pro­vid­ing re­lief to those strug­gling to meet their loan re­pay­ments.</p>
    <p>Data from the Mon­e­tary Author­ity of Sin­ga­pore shows that 34,000 home own­ers have asked to stop pay­ing their loans and in­ter­est un­til De­cem­ber.</p>
    <p>An­other 2,100 peo­ple have asked banks to de­fer their ren­o­va­tion and ed­u­ca­tion loan pay­ments.</p>
    <p>HDB said yes­ter­day it has in place var­i­ous as­sis­tance mea­sures to help flat own­ers fac­ing fi­nan­cial dif­fi­cul­ties tide through the Covid-19 cri­sis. These in­clude al­low­ing flat own­ers to:</p>
    <p>• Re­duce or de­fer their loan in­stal­ments for six months, with a fur­ther six-month ex­ten­sion if nec­es­sary;</p>
    <p>• Pay their loan ar­rears by in­stal­ment till their fi­nan­cial sit­u­a­tion im­proves; and • Ex­tend their mort­gage loan ten­ure to help re­duce their monthly in­stal­ments, if needed.</p>
    <p>Of the 1,356 house­holds, two-thirds re­quested to de­fer their loan in­stal­ments or pay their loan ar­rears by in­stal­ment, HDB said. The re­main­ing one-third of house­holds re­ceived other forms of as­sis­tance, in­clud­ing the ex­ten­sion of their mort­gage loan ten­ure to help re­duce monthly in­stal­ments.</p>
    <p>“This will give them more time and space to sort out their fi­nances, seek re-em­ploy­ment and/or im­prove their fi­nan­cial sit­u­a­tion,” said HDB.</p>
    <p>Those who face “longer-term hard­ship” can in­clude work­ing fam­ily mem­bers as joint own­ers to help pay for the flat.</p>
    <p>Al­ter­na­tively, they can con­sider right-siz­ing to a smaller flat that is within their bud­get, added HDB.</p>
    <p>Flat own­ers who re­quire as­sis­tance with their mort­gage pay­ments can con­tact HDB on 1800-225-5432 from 8am to 5pm on week­days, or make an ap­point­ment with hous­ing coun­sel­lors at the HDB branches for ad­vice.</p>
