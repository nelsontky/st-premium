    <p>Good rid­dance, 2020. Thanks for noth­ing.</p>
    <p>You will long be re­mem­bered for be­ing a spe­cial kind of aw­ful, a year when nearly any­thing that could go wrong did its level best to do so.</p>
    <p>And, as if to rub it in, this an­nus hor­ri­bilis was a leap year, gift­ing us one ex­tra day to en­dure as we ir­ra­tionally hope that fate and mis­for­tune ob­serve the Gre­go­rian calendar.</p>
    <p>To be clear, the year was not ter­ri­ble just on ac­count of all the dif­fer­ent ter­ri­ble things it crammed into its 366 days.</p>
    <p>No doubt, the world couldn’t seem to catch a break this year: There were his­toric wild­fires in Aus­tralia and the western United States, a mas­sive ex­plo­sion in down­town Beirut, the im­peach­ment of US Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump, the deaths of some of the world’s most beloved stars, wide­spread protests over racial in­jus­tice in the US, and other mis­for­tunes al­most too nu­mer­ous to count.</p>
    <p>In­deed, var­i­ous calami­ties be­fall us ev­ery year. It’s just that some of the big­gest ones in 2020 were note­wor­thy for be­ing seem­ingly self-con­tra­dic­tory – para­doxes where the ob­vi­ous so­lu­tion can also make mat­ters worse.</p>
    <p>The Covid-19 outbreak is the best ex­am­ple 2020 pro­vided of that no­tion. As a prob­lem, the pan­demic re­quired col­lec­tive action but in­di­vid­ual in­ten­tion to tackle. It wanted us to be alone but also to work to­gether.</p>
    <p>It asked of us to act in ways not al­ways ob­vi­ously ben­e­fi­cial to the in­di­vid­ual, while si­mul­ta­ne­ously de­priv­ing us of con­tact with the com­mu­nity our sac­ri­fices were meant to serve.</p>
    <p>We had to stay at home when­ever pos­si­ble, wear masks and stay away from one an­other, in or­der to help one an­other. It si­mul­ta­ne­ously re­quired a sense of com­mu­nity and eroded it.</p>
    <p>Sim­i­larly, in or­der to sur­vive lock­downs – a sac­ri­fice needed for the col­lec­tive good – peo­ple rushed to su­per­mar­kets and en­gaged in ex­tremely self­ish be­hav­iour, de­priv­ing their neigh­bours of sup­plies by hoard­ing food and toi­let pa­per.</p>
    <p>This is the sort of log­i­cal con­flict that we had to con­tend with time and again in 2020, this year’s sig­na­ture move of sorts.</p>
    <p>The eco­nomic fall­out of this pub­lic health cri­sis worked in a sim­i­lar cir­cuitous fash­ion.</p>
    <p>The pan­demic forced lock­downs which caused an eco­nomic cri­sis.</p>
    <p>But the only way to re­cover is to let busi­nesses re­open and get peo­ple back to work – a move that would al­most cer­tainly make the pan­demic worse and, of course, force longer lock­downs.</p>
    <p>The par­tic­u­lar na­ture of the cri­sis also meant that the work­ers most pro­tected from the ef­fects of it, those who worked in of­fices, de­pended more than ever on those who were most vul­ner­a­ble – the es­sen­tial work­ers send­ing food to</p>
    <p>their homes and keep­ing sup­ply chains open and run­ning.</p>
    <p>At a time when peo­ple stuck at home were con­sum­ing more entertainm­ent, those in the arts had to con­tend with the no­tion that what they did was ac­tu­ally non-es­sen­tial.</p>
    <p>It was also a year when we re­dis­cov­ered the nu­clear fam­ily, spend­ing all day with and some­times work­ing along­side chil­dren we pre­vi­ously saw only on week­ends.</p>
    <p>And while some com­plained about hav­ing to turn one small din­ing table into of­fice and class­room, those liv­ing away from their home coun­tries found them­selves sep­a­rated from their fam­i­lies for nearly a year.</p>
    <p>With eco­nomic and nat­u­ral dis­as­ters, 2020 shone a stark light on some of the big­gest long­stand­ing prob­lems fac­ing all of us, such as in­equal­ity and cli­mate change. But then, it also gave rea­sons to in­di­vid­u­als and gov­ern­ments to put off solv­ing these prob­lems till later.</p>
    <p>And that is per­haps the big­gest curse of 2020: the feel­ing of help­less­ness.</p>
    <p>By iso­lat­ing peo­ple and then pair­ing enor­mous prob­lems with im­per­fect so­lu­tions, 2020 sucked the hope and sense of pos­si­bil­ity out of all but the most de­ter­mined.</p>
    <p>For many, this was not the year to push for­ward, but one to take cover and wait out the storm. This was a year for play­ing it safe, for fo­cus­ing on putting one foot in front of the other, for putting off the dif­fi­cult de­ci­sions un­til later.</p>
    <p>In other words, 2020 was the year life got put on hold.</p>
    <p>No mat­ter what we try to sal­vage – and there are peo­ple who man­aged to make the most of a bad sit­u­a­tion – this was the year of hopes and dreams shelved.</p>
    <p>We wrote it off, telling our­selves we will get back on track in 2021.</p>
    <p>Next year can’t come soon enough.</p>
