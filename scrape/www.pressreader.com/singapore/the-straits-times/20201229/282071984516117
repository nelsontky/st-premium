    <p>Com­muters on the Down­town Line (DTL) had their jour­neys af­fected yes­ter­day by a sig­nalling fault that struck dur­ing evening peak hour and lasted more than 41/ hours.</p>
    <p>2</p>
    <p>Rail op­er­a­tor SBS Tran­sit first an­nounced the fault on its Twit­ter page at about 6.50pm.</p>
    <p>It said then that com­muters would face up to 15 min­utes of ad­di­tional trav­el­ling time be­tween Expo and Gey­lang Bahru sta­tions.</p>
    <p>There are 10 other MRT sta­tions lo­cated be­tween Expo and Gey­lang Bahru.</p>
    <p>In an update at 8.20pm, the op­er­a­tor said the ex­tra trav­el­ling time would be about 20 min­utes.</p>
    <p>It also apol­o­gised for the in­con­ve­nience caused.</p>
    <p>Sev­eral com­muters com­plained about the fault on so­cial me­dia from about 6.30pm yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Some also dis­puted SBS Tran­sit’s claim of a 15-minute de­lay and said their trains were stuck at each af­fected sta­tion for about 10 min­utes.</p>
    <p>Sim­i­larly, a Straits Times re­porter, who boarded the train at Mat­tar at 9pm to go to Be­dok North, ex­pe­ri­enced a five- to 10-minute wait at each sta­tion be­fore the train moved on.</p>
    <p>A com­muter, who wanted to be known only as Ms Gu­nawan, 32, said she had a 35-minute de­lay in her jour­ney from Expo to MacPher­son.</p>
    <p>She added: “I took the Down­town Line be­cause I had no other route home.</p>
    <p>“I wish they would com­mu­ni­cate (these is­sues) to the com­muter more clearly.</p>
    <p>“I had to check the In­ter­net to know what ex­actly hap­pened.”</p>
    <p>Te­masek Polytech­nic stu­dent Si­a­mul Hoque, 17, who boarded at Be­dok North, ex­pe­ri­enced a de­lay of about 25 min­utes in his trip to Jalan Be­sar.</p>
    <p>“To a small ex­tent, I was frus­trated but be­cause I was with my friends, it was not that bad,” he said.</p>
    <p>Sig­nalling systems are used to di­rect rail traf­fic and en­sure a safe dis­tance be­tween trains.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day’s DTL ser­vice dis­rup­tion was the sec­ond ma­jor sig­nalling fault along an MRT line this month.</p>
    <p>On Dec 4, Thom­son-East Coast Line ser­vices were dis­rupted for five hours be­cause of a soft­ware glitch in the sig­nalling sys­tem’s net­work com­po­nent.</p>
