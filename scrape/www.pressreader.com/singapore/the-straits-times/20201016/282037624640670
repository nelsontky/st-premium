    <p>Par­ents of Sin­ga­porean chil­dren born be­fore Oct 1 but whose cer­ti­fied es­ti­mated de­liv­ery date was on or after Oct 1 can ap­peal for the $3,000 Baby Sup­port Grant, said Min­is­ter in the Prime Min­is­ter’s Of­fice In­dra­nee Ra­jah.</p>
    <p>More in­for­ma­tion on how par­ents can sub­mit ap­peals will be made avail­able soon by the Na­tional Pop­u­la­tion and Ta­lent Divi­sion, said Ms In­dra­nee, who is in charge of the divi­sion.</p>
    <p>Last Fri­day, the Gov­ern­ment said only ba­bies born be­tween Oct 1 and Sept 30, 2022, will qual­ify for the one-off $3,000 grant, which is meant to help de­fray the cost of hav­ing a child amid the coro­n­avirus out­break.</p>
    <p>In re­sponse to con­cerns raised by Mr Sak­tiandi Su­paat (Bis­han-Toa Payoh GRC), Ms He Ting Ru (Sengkang GRC) and oth­ers, Ms In­dra­nee in Par­lia­ment yes­ter­day said she “fully un­der­stands that par­ents who were not el­i­gi­ble to re­ceive the Baby Sup­port Grant are dis­ap­pointed”.</p>
    <p>She said: “They ex­pe­ri­enced in­con­ve­niences and chal­lenges in car­ing for new­borns this year, espe­cially dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker.”</p>
    <p>This in­cluded hav­ing to cope with new vis­i­ta­tion guide­lines and re­stric­tions at health­care fa­cil­i­ties, and hav­ing to adapt quickly when it be­came dif­fi­cult to get help to care for new­borns, added Ms In­dra­nee.</p>
    <p>There were plans ini­tially to pro­vide a one-off grant next year from Jan 1, as part of next year’s Bud­get, she said. “How­ever, we felt it was im­por­tant to get the sup­port out as quickly as we can to help more Sin­ga­pore­ans with their par­ent­hood as­pi­ra­tions. An­nounc­ing the plans next year could mean that cou­ples may de­lay at­tempts to have a child in the mean­time. So, we tried hard to see how we could do this ear­lier.”</p>
    <p>De­spite the Gov­ern­ment’s tight fis­cal sit­u­a­tion, it was able to set aside some bud­get funds this year to pro­vide more sup­port for Sin­ga­porean par­ents as soon as it could and that, she said, ex­plains the start date of Oct 1.</p>
    <p>Ms In­dra­nee added that there is al­ready sub­stan­tial gov­ern­ment sup­port for par­ents, in­clud­ing cash sup­port of $8,000 to $10,000 of­fered by the Baby Bonus cash gift and be­tween $3,000 and $15,000 in gov­ern­ment co-sav­ings for the Child De­vel­op­ment Ac­count.</p>
    <p>Leader of the Op­po­si­tion Pri­tam Singh asked if the Gov­ern­ment will con­sider ex­tend­ing the Baby Sup­port Grant to Sin­ga­pore­ans who have re­ceived sub­si­dies from other re­lief schemes, like the Covid-19 Sup­port Grant.</p>
    <p>In re­sponse, Ms In­dra­nee said the Baby Sup­port Grant has a “very spe­cific pol­icy in­tent” of en­cour­ag­ing those who want to have chil­dren but may be de­lay­ing their plans in the cur­rent cli­mate. Par­ents in the low-in­come bracket who need ex­tra help will be sup­ported by the Gov­ern­ment, she added.</p>
    <p>Mr Louis Ng (Nee Soon GRC) and Ms He asked if the grant could be ex­tended to un­wed par­ents, with Mr Ng not­ing that the ex­tra cash sup­port could pro­vide a life­line for them amid the out­break.</p>
    <p>Ms In­dra­nee said there are other schemes to help un­wed par­ents if they are strug­gling fi­nan­cially, and the au­thor­i­ties will look into how they can be sup­ported. She added that the Baby Sup­port Grant is also not ap­pli­ca­ble for sin­gle par­ents.</p>
    <p>How­ever, gov­ern­ment ben­e­fits to sup­port growth and de­vel­op­ment are given to all Sin­ga­porean chil­dren, re­gard­less of the par­ents’ mar­i­tal sta­tus, she said, in­clud­ing child­care and in­fant care sub­si­dies. “As so­ci­ety con­tin­ues to evolve, our poli­cies will be up­dated to keep pace with so­ci­etal re­al­i­ties,” she added.</p>
