    <p>In highly ur­banised Sin­ga­pore, it is no sur­prise that clashes with wildlife of­ten take place. The most re­cent case in­volved a wild boar and a woman in Pasir Ris who was in­jured.</p>
    <p>As Pasir Ris res­i­dents are now be­ing asked if wild an­i­mals should be re­moved from their area (Should wildlife stay or go? Pasir Ris res­i­dents to have a say, ST On­line, Nov 22), it is im­por­tant to take stock of what this de­ci­sion means.</p>
    <p>For Sin­ga­pore to see through its am­bi­tion of be­com­ing a “city in na­ture”, it is im­per­a­tive to look at wildlife man­age­ment holis­ti­cally and ex­ten­sively to main­tain this bal­ance with ur­ban liv­ing. Any de­ci­sion that is made now will ul­ti­mately set a prece­dent and af­fect other an­i­mals and ecosys­tems in the city state.</p>
    <p>It is thus nec­es­sary to de­velop a com­pre­hen­sive an­i­mal man­age­ment frame­work that in­cludes extensive public ed­u­ca­tion to help res­i­dents co-ex­ist with wildlife here.</p>
    <p>Public ed­u­ca­tion should start from a young age to in­cul­cate re­spect for na­ture and for the young to learn not to feed wildlife.</p>
    <p>Be­yond ed­u­ca­tion, al­ter­na­tive mea­sures should be con­sid­ered first. For ex­am­ple, bar­ri­ers can be erected to ring-fence wildlife in</p>
    <p>their des­ig­nated niches.</p>
    <p>An­other way to put res­i­dents out of harm’s way, specif­i­cally in re­la­tion to wild boars, could be to cut their dan­ger­ous tusks, much like manag­ing the antlers of deer in Nara in Ja­pan. Re­moval or culling of wildlife should be a last re­sort.</p>
    <p>It is easy to re­move wildlife from our midst when they are shrugged off as a mere in­con­ve­nience, as seen with the re­cent re­moval of chick­ens in Sin Ming es­tate (Some chick­ens in Sin Ming HDB es­tate to be re­lo­cated to Sele­tar Farm af­ter con­cerns raised, ST On­line, Oct 8).</p>
    <p>How­ever, for Sin­ga­pore to truly re­alise its “city in na­ture” am­bi­tion, we must not ac­knowl­edge wildlife as a part of the coun­try only when it is con­ve­nient to do so. The in­con­ve­nient truth is that there is no na­ture with­out wildlife.</p>
