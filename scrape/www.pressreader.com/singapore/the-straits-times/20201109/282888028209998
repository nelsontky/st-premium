    <p>Aries (March 21 - April 19)</p>
    <p>This is a bad time to rush through work. It is too easy to make mis­takes that way. You need to take ev­ery­thing one step at a time and get it right the first time.</p>
    <p>Tau­rus (April 20 - May 20)</p>
    <p>It is not that hard to take it easy. Your great en­ergy should let you get work done early or sneak away from obli­ga­tions with­out caus­ing a stir.</p>
    <p>Gem­ini (May 21 - June 20)</p>
    <p>Some­one close needs your ad­vice but you do not know how to speak to him. That is a rare prob­lem for you – find out what you are afraid of.</p>
    <p>Can­cer (June 21 - July 22)</p>
    <p>Your left brain is work­ing hard and you are mak­ing lots of progress. Your en­ergy is strong and you should find good an­swers soon.</p>
    <p>Leo (July 23 - Aug 22)</p>
    <p>You are feel­ing with­drawn. If any­one pesters you to en­ter­tain him, just wave him off and get back to work. He should get the hint.</p>
    <p>Virgo (Aug 23 - Sept 22)</p>
    <p>You are fo­cused on the de­tails today and you love it. They all line up in the most pleas­ing way and look bet­ter while you fid­dle with them.</p>
    <p>Li­bra (Sept 23 - Oct 22)</p>
    <p>You should avoid the temp­ta­tion to hold on to anger. It is not good. Just try to re­lax and re­lease your emo­tions in a pos­i­tive way.</p>
    <p>Scor­pio (Oct 23 - Nov 21)</p>
    <p>You are great at plan­ning com­plex projects. Your men­tal en­ergy is just right for putting all the pieces into place. Peo­ple should be im­pressed.</p>
    <p>Sagit­tar­ius (Nov 22 - Dec 21)</p>
    <p>You should try not to ask any­one for more than what he has promised you. It is not a good day for favours.</p>
    <p>Bide your time and ask later.</p>
    <p>Capri­corn (Dec 22 - Jan 19)</p>
    <p>You are feel­ing more sure of your­self and bet­ter able to con­front those who stand in your path. You can han­dle the con­se­quences.</p>
    <p>Aquar­ius (Jan 20 - Feb 18)</p>
    <p>You have to deal with some­one new today. Slow down and let him talk be­cause you may find some clues as to what you can do next.</p>
    <p>Pisces (Feb 19 - March 20)</p>
    <p>Things are some­what un­set­tled but you can make things work out for the best if you pay at­ten­tion. Make sure peo­ple know how to reach you.</p>
