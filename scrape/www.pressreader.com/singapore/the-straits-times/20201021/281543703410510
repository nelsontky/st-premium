    <p>Home cooks in Sin­ga­pore will be able to buy Im­pos­si­ble Beef, a plant-based meat sub­sti­tute made by Im­pos­si­ble Foods in the United States, in 79 FairPrice stores and from on­line gro­cer RedMart start­ing this week. A 340g pack will sell for $16.90, or about $5 for 100g – more ex­pen­sive than a lot of su­per­mar­ket ground beef.</p>
    <p>Home cooks in Sin­ga­pore will be able to buy Im­pos­si­ble Beef, a plant-based meat sub­sti­tute made by Im­pos­si­ble Foods in the United States, in 79 FairPrice stores and from on­line gro­cer RedMart start­ing this week.</p>
    <p>A 340g pack will sell for $16.90, or about $5 for 100g, more ex­pen­sive than a lot of su­per­mar­ket ground beef. RedMart, for ex­am­ple, sells Mas­ter Gro­cer Aus­tralia’s pre­mium frozen grass­fed minced beef for $6.95 for a 500g pack, which works out to $1.39 for 100g.</p>
    <p>Still, the Amer­i­can com­pany, head­quar­tered in Sil­i­con Val­ley, is banking on cu­ri­ous home cooks snap­ping up the prod­uct. In the US, Im­pos­si­ble Beef is sold at more than 11,000 stores, in­clud­ing at retail gi­ant Wal­mart stores, and at Kroger, the big­gest gro­cery chain there.</p>
    <p>Nine out of 10 cus­tomers are meat eaters, the com­pany’s chief fi­nan­cial of­fi­cer, Mr David Lee, told The Straits Times in a Zoom in­ter­view from the US.</p>
    <p>Asked about the price, he said the com­pany was com­mit­ted to re­duc­ing the price of its prod­ucts, but would not say if Im­pos­si­ble planned to open a fa­cil­ity in Asia to man­u­fac­ture the plant-based meat.</p>
    <p>He said, how­ever, that any “high­qual­ity man­u­fac­tur­ing fa­cil­ity” would be able to make the prod­uct.</p>
    <p>Aside from Sin­ga­pore, the plant­based meat, made from soya pro­tein, is also be­ing sold in PARKnSHOP su­per­mar­kets in Hong Kong.</p>
    <p>The prod­uct was launched in both cities in March last year and, to date, about 550 restau­rants in Sin­ga­pore and about 700 restau­rants in Hong Kong and Ma­cau serve it.</p>
    <p>Home cooks were able to buy 2.27kg bricks of the meat sub­sti­tute for $88.90 each dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker pe­riod, to help restau­rants sell off their stock when dine-in was not al­lowed here.</p>
    <p>The com­pany launched its pork sub­sti­tutes – Im­pos­si­ble Pork and Im­pos­si­ble Sausage – at the Con­sumer Elec­tron­ics Show in Las Ve­gas early this year. Im­pos­si­ble Pork has not been launched com­mer­cially and the com­pany has not an­nounced plans to do so.</p>
    <p>Im­pos­si­ble Sausage, a pre-sea­soned vari­a­tion which can be used to make pat­ties and as a pizza top­ping, de­buted in the US in the mid­dle of the year and launched in Hong Kong last month. Mr Lee has no dates for its Sin­ga­pore launch.</p>
    <p>Dr Pat Brown, founder and chief ex­ec­u­tive of­fi­cer of Im­pos­si­ble Foods, told The Straits Times: “Asia ab­so­lutely is our No. 1 pri­or­ity for ex­pan­sion, as our long-term goal is to make it avail­able glob­ally and ev­ery­where meat from an­i­mals is sold. We’ve seen high adop­tion in Hong Kong, Ma­cau and Sin­ga­pore, which is en­cour­ag­ing for when we ex­pand through­out Asia.”</p>
    <p>Af­ter caus­ing a stir with its beef sub­sti­tute, which tastes like the real thing, he is gun­ning for the pork mar­ket.</p>
    <p>He said: “Our next fo­cus is to ‘dis­rupt the pig’ and go af­ter the en­tire ecosys­tem of pork pro­duc­tion.</p>
    <p>“Af­ter cows, pigs have the sec­ond-largest global en­vi­ron­men­tal foot­print. Pigs are the most widely eaten an­i­mal in the world, ac­count­ing for about 38 per cent of meat pro­duc­tion world­wide.</p>
    <p>“Even worse than cows, us­ing pigs to make pork poses ma­jor threats to pub­lic health. Swine and avian flus are the most likely pan­demic vec­tors be­cause they pass eas­ily to hu­mans via fae­ces in slaugh­ter­houses.</p>
    <p>“A Univer­sity of Min­nesota study dis­cov­ered fae­cal mat­ter in 69 per cent of pork and a dev­as­tat­ing case of African swine fever has al­ready wiped out roughly one-quar­ter of the world’s pigs and is ex­pected to drive up world­wide prices of an­i­mal pro­tein.”</p>
    <p>When The Straits Times in­ter­viewed Dr Brown at the launch of Im­pos­si­ble in Sin­ga­pore in March last year, he had said his team of sci­en­tists was look­ing to cre­ate whole pieces of plant-based meat in­stead of ground-up meat sub­sti­tutes. Work is on­go­ing.</p>
    <p>He said: “Steak and other whole cuts are de­cid­edly more dif­fi­cult to make from plant-based in­gre­di­ents ex­actly be­cause they are ‘whole’ slabs of meat.</p>
    <p>“When we en­gi­neer them, we need to put to­gether plant com­po­nents that have dif­fer­ent func­tions. We want red and bloody heme in the mid­dle of a steak. We want a strip of juicy fat line cut­ting across it.</p>
    <p>“Putting to­gether th­ese dif­fer­ent parts of a steak and mak­ing sure ev­ery com­po­nent is where it needs to be is much more dif­fi­cult with a large solid slab of meat than with ground meat, in which 90 per cent of assem­bly is mix­ing the com­po­nents to­gether.”</p>
