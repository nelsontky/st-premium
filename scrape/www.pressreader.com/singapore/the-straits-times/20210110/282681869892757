    <p>LON­DON • Chelsea man­ager Frank Lampard has said that his team’s re­cent poor run of re­sults makes his job at Stam­ford Bridge more ex­cit­ing and gives him an op­por­tu­nity to learn more about him­self and his play­ers.</p>
    <p>Ex­pec­ta­tions were high at the start of the Blues’ cam­paign af­ter they spent more than £200 mil­lion (S$359 mil­lion) on new play­ers in the sum­mer, but Lampard’s po­si­tion has come un­der scru­tiny with four de­feats in their last six Premier League games l eav­ing them ninth in the ta­ble.</p>
    <p>He is hop­ing for a re­ac­tion from his play­ers when they host More­cambe in the FA Cup third round to­day, be­fore a west Lon­don derby against Ful­ham on Fri­day.</p>
    <p>“I came into this job ex­pect­ing pres­sure,” Lampard said.</p>
    <p>“Now I find this more chal­leng­ing in a good way in terms of my job, be­cause I can find out more about my­self, I can find out more about ev­ery mem­ber of the team and the staff. And it ac­tu­ally makes my job more ex­cit­ing.”</p>
    <p>The Chelsea boss said mid­fielder N’Golo Kante and de­fender An­dreas Chris­tensen are out with in­juries, with full­back Reece James al­ready on the side­lines.</p>
    <p>Five Chelsea academy grad­u­ates – Tino An­jorin, Jude Soon­sup-Bell, Lewis Bate, Tino Livra­mento and Henry Lawrence – could feature to­day, hav­ing trained with the first team this week.</p>
    <p>“It is a great ex­pe­ri­ence for them,” Lampard said.</p>
    <p>“It is great to be able to gauge young play­ers on not only how quickly they take to the foot­ball side, but (also) how quickly their per­son­al­i­ties take to the up­lift in pres­sure and level of train­ing.”</p>
    <p>The 42-year-old also has no qualms about his abil­ity to keep his play­ers fo­cused in bad times.</p>
    <p>“I don’t think there was a sea­son I played at this club, for all the suc­cess we had over the years, where we didn’t have dif­fi­cult mo­ments – a de­feat, or a dou­ble de­feat, a run of bad matches, a bad month, a bad pe­riod,” he said.</p>
    <p>“It’s part and par­cel, so I’m the first one that has to be pos­i­tive and get ex­cited about the fact that los­ing games is the big­gest chance to im­prove in foot­ball.”</p>
    <p>Chelsea will hope to put last week­end’s 3-1 loss to Manch­ester City be­hind. Pep Guardi­ola’s men, who fol­lowed up that vic­tory with a 2-0 League Cup semi-fi­nal win over Manch­ester United on Wed­nes­day, host sec­ond-tier Birm­ing­ham City to­day.</p>
    <p>The City man­ager said Ser­gio Aguero could make his first start since Oc­to­ber.</p>
    <p>The striker has played nine games in all com­pe­ti­tions this sea­son af­ter miss­ing the start of the cam­paign fol­low­ing knee surgery.</p>
    <p>He last started for City in a 1-1 Premier League draw at West Ham on Oct 24, when he was with­drawn at half-time with a ham­string prob­lem.</p>
    <p>“The feel­ing in the last 10 days – two weeks, his re­ac­tion in his knee has been re­ally good,” Guardi­ola said. “It will be great to have Ser­gio back and in good con­di­tion.”</p>
    <p>De­fender Kyle Walker and striker Gabriel Je­sus, who were among six play­ers who tested pos­i­tive for Covid-19, will un­dergo a late fit­ness test. Mean­while, goal­keeper Eder­son, winger Fer­ran Tor­res and de­fender Eric Gar­cia are still self-iso­lat­ing.</p>
    <p>ALL IN THE GAME</p>
    <p>A de­feat, or a dou­ble de­feat, a run of bad matches, a bad month, a bad pe­riod. It’s part and par­cel, so I’m the first one that has to be pos­i­tive and get ex­cited about the fact that los­ing games is the big­gest chance to im­prove in foot­ball.</p>
