    <p>China’s top lead­ers are meet­ing this week to set a course for the coun­try’s eco­nomic and so­cial de­vel­op­ment in the near and longer term.</p>
    <p>This comes as it emerges from a dev­as­tat­ing pan­demic and braces it­self for a de­cou­pling with the United States.</p>
    <p>In­vestors, en­vi­ron­men­tal­ists and China watch­ers will be tun­ing in as the lead­er­ship en­dorses the next five-year plan and an even big­ger blueprint lead­ing to 2035.</p>
    <p>The Fifth Plenum, which started yes­ter­day and ends on Thurs­day, is one of the most im­por­tant events on the Chi­nese Com­mu­nist Party cal­en­dar as its po­lit­i­cal elite gather to dis­cuss a wide range of is­sues, in­clud­ing per­son­nel changes and suc­ces­sion plans.</p>
    <p>Bei­jing is ex­pected to dou­ble down on its “dual cir­cu­la­tion” strat­egy in the face of greater global un­cer­tainty, while ramp­ing up indige­nous in­no­va­tion in a bid for self-re­liance, whether in tech, food se­cu­rity or en­ergy.</p>
    <p>It will con­tinue boost­ing do­mes­tic con­sump­tion, as well as court­ing for­eign in­vest­ment and “en­gag­ing with the ex­ter­nal econ­omy”, said Pres­i­dent Xi Jin­ping dur­ing his tour of the south­ern prov­inces two weeks ago.</p>
    <p>As­sis­tant Pro­fes­sor Lee Jonghyuk, who stud­ies Chi­nese pol­i­tics and econ­omy at the S. Ra­jarat­nam School of In­ter­na­tional Stud­ies in Sin­ga­pore, said: “I think the Chi­nese gov­ern­ment will em­pha­sise the diver­si­fi­ca­tion of trade part­ners and at­tract non-US for­eign trade in­vest­ments.</p>
    <p>“How­ever, the trade diver­si­fi­ca­tion, mainly through the Belt and Road Ini­tia­tive, was sig­nif­i­cantly lim­ited by the (coron­avirus) pan­demic and global re­ces­sion.”</p>
    <p>The ini­tia­tive is a sig­na­ture project of Pres­i­dent Xi’s to con­nect China with other coun­tries through old and new trade routes.</p>
    <p>The Chi­nese econ­omy is grad­u­ally re­cov­er­ing but re­mains vul­ner­a­ble in the wake of the Covid-19 out­break. Its gross do­mes­tic prod­uct (GDP) shrank by 6.8 per cent year on year in the first quar­ter but sub­se­quently re­bounded, post­ing 3.2 per cent growth in the sec­ond quar­ter and 4.9 per cent ex­pan­sion in the third quar­ter.</p>
    <p>An­a­lysts had pre­dicted as much as a 5.5 per cent ex­pan­sion in the lat­est quar­ter.</p>
    <p>While be­low tar­get, it was still the world’s best per­former.</p>
    <p>China will un­doubt­edly set a higher tar­get for its re­search and de­vel­op­ment spend­ing in the up­com­ing 14th five-year plan as it seeks to re­duce de­pen­dence on for­eign tech­nol­ogy and as its tech war with the US roils on, said Mr Bert Hof­man, the direc­tor of the East Asian Institute at the Na­tional Univer­sity of Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>“China is well un­der­way to be­com­ing a tech­no­log­i­cal pow­er­house. The coun­try now spends some 2.2 per cent of GDP on R&D, and the 2.5 per cent tar­get of the 13th five-year plan may still be reached this year,” he said, adding that the new tar­get could be 3 per cent.</p>
    <p>On the po­lit­i­cal front, Tai­wan’s de­ci­sion-mak­ers will also be watch­ing the plenum for men­tion of re­uni­fi­ca­tion in the 2035 blueprint.</p>
    <p>There is cur­rently no known timetable for re­uni­fi­ca­tion be­tween China and Tai­wan, a sel­f­ruled is­land that Bei­jing has claimed as its own since 1949.</p>
    <p>Tai­wan has be­come a re­gional flash­point amid de­te­ri­o­rat­ing re­la­tions be­tween Bei­jing and Wash­ing­ton.</p>
    <p>Pres­i­dent Xi marked the 70th an­niver­sary of the start of the Korean War last Fri­day with a warn­ing that China will never al­low its sovereignt­y, se­cu­rity and de­vel­op­ment in­ter­ests to be un­der­mined.</p>
    <p>“Let the world know that ‘the peo­ple of China are now or­gan­ised and are not to be tri­fled with’,” Mr Xi said, in­vok­ing Mao Ze­dong, the found­ing fa­ther of the Peo­ple’s Re­pub­lic of China.</p>
    <p>Per­son­nel changes are also in the mix at the Fifth Plenum, with China’s top state plan­ner He Lifeng, a po­lit­i­cal ally of Pres­i­dent Xi, ex­pected to step down soon, two sources with ties to the Chi­nese lead­er­ship told The Straits Times.</p>
    <p>Mr He, 65, min­is­ter of the pow­er­ful Na­tional De­vel­op­ment and Re­form Com­mis­sion (NDRC) un­der the Cabi­net since 2017, is tipped to be suc­ceeded by an­other mentee of Pres­i­dent Xi, Mr Tang Dengjie, 56, who was named NDRC vice-min­is­ter in July this year.</p>
    <p>The change of guard could come as early as the end of this week or dur­ing the an­nual full ses­sion of Par­lia­ment next March, the sources said, speak­ing on con­di­tion of anonymity.</p>
    <p>From 1986 to 1995, Mr Tang was with a Shang­hai-based joint ven­ture be­tween Ger­man au­tomaker Volk­swa­gen and state-owned en­ter­prise SAIC Mo­tor. He rose to as­sis­tant man­ager for plan­ning and de­vel­op­ment in 1994.</p>
    <p>“Tang Dengjie tak­ing over the NDRC will be a boon for China’s auto in­dus­try,” one source said.</p>
    <p>The China As­so­ci­a­tion of Au­to­mo­tive Man­u­fac­tur­ers has urged the gov­ern­ment to boost sup­port for ex­ports of China-made cars, ac­cord­ing to a re­port seen by ST.</p>
    <p>China over­took the US as the</p>
    <p>world’s largest auto mar­ket in 2010, but its car ex­ports are neg­li­gi­ble.</p>
    <p>The re­port also urged back­ing for the man­u­fac­ture of elec­tric ve­hi­cles and smart car tech­nolo­gies, but did not men­tion a dol­lar fig­ure.</p>
    <p>The car in­dus­try body sent the re­port to the NDRC, the Min­istry of Com­merce and the Min­istry of In­dus­try and In­for­ma­tion Tech­nol­ogy for in­clu­sion into the 14th fiveyear plan that will be en­dorsed at the plenum.</p>
    <p>Sev­eral politi­cians who have reached the com­pul­sory re­tire</p>
    <p>ment age of 65 for Cabi­net min­is­ters and pro­vin­cial party sec­re­taries are also ex­pected to step down, the sources said.</p>
    <p>These in­clude the party sec­re­taries of Guizhou, Hu­nan, Jilin and Yun­nan prov­inces and the au­ton­o­mous re­gion of In­ner Mon­go­lia, who will leave as part of a sweep­ing reshuf­fle ahead of the party’s 2022 congress, which is held once ev­ery five years.</p>
