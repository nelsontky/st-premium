    <p>A Sin­ga­pore Air­lines cabin crew mem­ber who works as a part-time pri­vate-hire driver with Grab was the sole Covid-19 case in the com­mu­nity con­firmed yes­ter­day, said the Min­istry of Health (MOH).</p>
    <p>There were also four new im­ported cases, tak­ing Sin­ga­pore’s to­tal to 58,529.</p>
    <p>The com­mu­nity case is a 48-yearold Sin­ga­porean man who is asymp­to­matic and was detected through proac­tive test­ing ar­ranged by the Civil Avi­a­tion Author­ity of Sin­ga­pore for air crew who re­turned from overseas flights. He had trav­elled to the United States on duty from Dec 12 to 16 on a con­trolled itin­er­ary, said MOH.</p>
    <p>He was tested last Wed­nes­day, but his test re­sult came back in­con­clu­sive two days later. This ne­ces­si­tated a sec­ond test that same day, which was also in­con­clu­sive.</p>
    <p>He had re­mained at home while await­ing fur­ther tests.</p>
    <p>On Sun­day, his swab came back pos­i­tive for Covid-19 in­fec­tion and he was taken in an am­bu­lance to the Na­tional Cen­tre for In­fec­tious Dis­eases on the same day.</p>
    <p>His sero­log­i­cal test re­sult is neg­a­tive, which in­di­cates a likely cur­rent in­fec­tion.</p>
    <p>The cabin crew on the same US flight as him all tested neg­a­tive for Covid-19 in­fec­tion last Wed­nes­day.</p>
    <p>MOH added that it has clas­si­fied the case as lo­cally trans­mit­ted due to the rel­a­tively long time in­ter­val be­tween the pa­tient’s travel and his pos­i­tive Covid-19 test, and that epi­demi­o­log­i­cal in­ves­ti­ga­tions are in progress.</p>
    <p>All the iden­ti­fied close con­tacts of the pa­tient, in­clud­ing his fam­ily mem­bers and co-work­ers, have been isolated and placed on quar­an­tine. They will be tested at the start and end of their quar­an­tine pe­riod so that MOH can de­tect asymp­to­matic cases.</p>
    <p>The min­istry will also con­duct sero­log­i­cal tests for the close con­tacts to de­ter­mine if the pa­tient could have been in­fected by them.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, a restau­rant in Up­per Paya Le­bar Road has been added to the places vis­ited by Covid-19 pa­tients while they were still in­fec­tious.</p>
    <p>Yu Cun Clay­pot Curry Fish Head was vis­ited by a pa­tient on Dec 18 be­tween 1.25pm and 2.25pm.</p>
    <p>MOH pro­vides the list of locations that in­fec­tious Covid-19 pa­tients vis­ited for at least 30 min­utes and the times they vis­ited them to get peo­ple who were at those places at the same time to mon­i­tor their health closely for two weeks from the date of their visit. The full list of locations and times can be found on the gov.sg web­site.</p>
    <p>MOH has said close con­tacts would al­ready have been no­ti­fied and that there is no need to avoid those places as they would have been cleaned if nec­es­sary.</p>
    <p>Of the four im­ported cases, three are Sin­ga­pore­ans who re­turned from In­dia, Myan­mar and the United King­dom. The re­main­ing case is a de­pen­dant’s pass holder who ar­rived from In­dia. They were all placed on stay-home no­tices (SHN) or isolated upon ar­rival in Sin­ga­pore, and were tested while serv­ing SHN or un­der isolation.</p>
    <p>Over­all, the num­ber of new cases in the com­mu­nity has re­mained low, with a to­tal of one case in the past week who is cur­rently un­linked.</p>
    <p>With 16 cases dis­charged yes­ter­day, 58,371 pa­tients have fully re­cov­ered from the dis­ease.</p>
    <p>A to­tal of 35 Covid-19 pa­tients re­main in hospi­tal, with none in in­ten­sive care, while 79 are re­cu­per­at­ing in com­mu­nity fa­cil­i­ties.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore has had 29 deaths from Covid-19 compli­cations, while 15 who tested pos­i­tive have died of other causes.</p>
