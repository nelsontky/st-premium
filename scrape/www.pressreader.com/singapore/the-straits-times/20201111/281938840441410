    <p>Af­ter months of daily video calls, I’m sorry to re­port that many of us are look­ing into our cam­eras at a deeply un­fash­ion­able an­gle.</p>
    <p>I thought prop­ping my lap­top up was stan­dard but it turns out to be a dis­tinct marker of age.</p>
    <p>To teenagers, the dis­tort­ing, down­ward-point­ing cam­era an­gle that mil­len­ni­als con­sider flat­ter­ing is the Zoom equiv­a­lent of slip­ping on a pair of boot­cut jeans and send­ing out a hun­dred Face­book friend re­quests, that is, com­pletely tragic. This sum­mer was marked by an out­pour­ing of on­line teenage teas­ing di­rected at mil­len­ni­als.</p>
    <p>It’s not just cam­era an­gles. Gen­er­a­tional di­vi­sions may be ar­ti­fi­cial but it turns out that there are all sorts of sig­ni­fiers that lump age groups to­gether in ways they may not no­tice them­selves.</p>
    <p>For mil­len­ni­als, these mark­ers in­clude side-hair part­ings, mak­ing a fuss of ba­sic “adult­ing” tasks, earnest­ness and all emo­jis – par­tic­u­larly the cry­ing-laugh­ing face.</p>
    <p>Gen Z is skew­er­ing them all. More se­ri­ously, teens are crit­i­cal about the will­ing­ness of older gen­er­a­tions, par­tic­u­larly mil­len­ni­als, to hand over pho­tos, lo­ca­tions and other per­sonal in­for­ma­tion to so­cial me­dia com­pa­nies in ex­change for likes.</p>
    <p>A year ago, I in­ter­viewed</p>
    <p>Ms El­iza Filby, a con­sul­tant who spe­cialises in the his­tory of gen­er­a­tions, about all the ways in which Gen Z, born in the late 1990s and on­wards, dif­fers from mil­len­ni­als, born in the 1980s and early 1990s.</p>
    <p>A room full of Bri­tish busi­ness lead­ers sat agog as she de­scribed the in­tense in­ter­est in pri­vacy that marked out younger gen­er­a­tions – and all the ways in which com­pa­nies failed to re­alise they were putting off those po­ten­tial cus­tomers.</p>
    <p>E-mails are in trou­ble, she ar­gued, re­garded by un­der-20s as stiffly for­mal.</p>
    <p>Peo­ple join­ing the work­force now may never have had their own e-mail ad­dress be­fore.</p>
    <p>Mes­sag­ing apps make them re­dun­dant. Data se­cu­rity and on­line hon­esty are essen­tial.</p>
    <p>This week, I spoke to Ms Filby again to see what im­pact she thought the coro­n­avirus pan­demic might have on these trends.</p>
    <p>With ev­ery­one locked away and forced to in­ter­act on­line more than ever, she thinks the pan­demic has given us all a bet­ter in­sight into oth­ers’ dig­i­tal lives – hence the mock­ery from teenagers.</p>
    <p>Yet com­pa­nies fail to dis­tin­guish be­tween gen­er­a­tions.</p>
    <p>At the start of the year, a poll by brand agency MBLM tried to find out which brands Amer­i­cans were most “emo­tion­ally con­nected” to. Boomers in their 50s and 60s picked pack­aged brands such as Kel­logg’s. Those aged 18-34, who have var­ied tastes, were grouped to­gether and picked en­ter­tain­ment brands.</p>
    <p>Face­book knows that it is los­ing favour fast. The Ox­ford In­ter­net In­sti­tute has al­ready pre­dicted that dead peo­ple will out­num­ber the liv­ing on Face­book within 50 years.</p>
    <p>Even on In­sta­gram, the photo-shar­ing com­pany owned by Face­book that is more pop­u­lar with younger users, fa­tigue lev­els are ris­ing.</p>
    <p>To any­one who has grown up in a world of ubiq­ui­tous re­touch­ing apps such as Face­tune, the idea of cu­rat­ing an In­sta-per­fect dig­i­tal archive of al­tered pho­tos can come off as phoney and em­bar­rass­ing.</p>
    <p>Claims that Gen Z is un­usu­ally in­ter­ested in so­cial jus­tice are weak­ened by the fact that ev­ery gen­er­a­tion has been de­scribed in the same way.</p>
    <p>But this gen­er­a­tion is un­de­ni­ably adept at on­line ac­tivism. See the suc­cess of K-pop stans, avid fans of Korean pop mu­sic, who claim to have pranked Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump’s cam­paign ral­lies.</p>
    <p>They are also aware that their on­line pri­vacy is likely to have been com­pro­mised from the start by par­ents and grand­par­ents.</p>
    <p>Warned of the dangers of im­age-shar­ing, they know that from child­hood a dig­i­tal foot­print has been cre­ated on their be­half, with­out their ap­proval, that has en­riched big tech com­pa­nies.</p>
    <p>Last year, ac­tress Gwyneth Pal­trow was told off by her 14-year-old daugh­ter Ap­ple for post­ing her photo on In­sta­gram. “Mom we have dis­cussed this,” Ap­ple wrote un­der the post.</p>
    <p>“You may not post any­thing with­out my con­sent.”</p>
    <p>Gen­er­a­tion lines are messy. Def­i­ni­tions are fluid and can look old quickly.</p>
    <p>A few years ago, there was some sug­ges­tion that mil­len­ni­als should be called the “iPod gen­er­a­tion”. The ref­er­ence now looks badly out of date.</p>
    <p>What is clear is that it is no longer use­ful to clump mil­len­ni­als and Gen Z to­gether as short-hand for youth.</p>
    <p>They may not have no­ticed it, but the up­per co­hort of mil­len­ni­als are fast ap­proach­ing mid­dle age. The sec­ond they try look­ing at them­selves in a Gen-Z-ap­proved up­ward cam­era an­gle, they’ll find that out for them­selves.</p>
