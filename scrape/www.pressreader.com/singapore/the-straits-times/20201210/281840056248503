    <p>The In­dian gov­ern­ment is con­sid­er­ing a pro­posal from the Elec­tion Com­mis­sion of In­dia (ECI) to al­low cit­i­zens liv­ing abroad to post their bal­lots.</p>
    <p>In its let­ter to the fed­eral Min­istry of Law and Jus­tice on Nov 27, the ECI said it is tech­ni­cally and ad­min­is­tra­tively ready to of­fer the Elec­tron­i­cally Trans­mit­ted Postal Bal­lot Sys­tem (ETPBS) to vot­ers abroad for elec­tions next year in As­sam, West Ben­gal, Ker­ala, Tamil Nadu and Puducherry.</p>
    <p>The ETPBS is used to ex­tend vot­ing rights to those in In­dia’s armed forces and para­mil­i­tary ser­vices within the coun­try, and to gov­ern­ment of­fi­cials posted abroad.</p>
    <p>A spokesman for the In­dian Min­istry of Ex­ter­nal Af­fairs (MEA) told a me­dia brief­ing last week it will be fully geared up to im­ple­ment any pro­posal re­gard­ing In­dian vot­ers abroad “when­ever any de­ci­sion is taken in this re­gard”.</p>
    <p>Cur­rently, non-res­i­dent In­di­ans (NRIs) must travel to the con­stituen­cies in In­dia where they are reg­is­tered as vot­ers to cast their bal­lots.</p>
    <p>This pro­hib­i­tive process has lim­ited their elec­toral par­tic­i­pa­tion, prompt­ing re­peated re­quests to open up eas­ier ways to vote.</p>
    <p>Only 25,606 NRIs voted in last year’s gen­eral elec­tion. Of these, 25,091 did so in the state of Ker­ala.</p>
    <p>How­ever, ac­cord­ing to a De­cem­ber 2018 gov­ern­ment es­ti­mate, there are more than 13 mil­lion NRIs, a vast ma­jor­ity of them in West Asian coun­tries such as the United Arab Emi­rates, Saudi Ara­bia and Kuwait.</p>
    <p>Un­der the ECI’s postal bal­lot pro­posal, an NRI will be is­sued a postal bal­lot elec­tron­i­cally af­ter he in­forms a re­turn­ing of­fi­cer of his con­stituency in writ­ing, us­ing a pre­scribed form that should reach the re­turn­ing of­fi­cer at least five days af­ter the no­ti­fi­ca­tion of the elec­tion.</p>
    <p>The NRI voter will then down­load and print the bal­lot pa­per, mark his pref­er­ence and re­turn it with a dec­la­ra­tion at­tested by an of­fi­cer ap­pointed by the diplo­matic or con­sular rep­re­sen­ta­tive of In­dia in the coun­try in which he lives.</p>
    <p>The In­dian Ex­press, which first re­ported this de­vel­op­ment, has said it is not clear yet if the voter will re­turn the bal­lot pa­per through or­di­nary post or drop it off at the lo­cal In­dian mis­sion, which may then send it to an elec­toral of­fi­cer in In­dia.</p>
    <p>Mr O.P. Rawat, who re­tired as the coun­try’s 22nd chief elec­tion com­mis­sioner in De­cem­ber 2018, told The Straits Times a key con­cern would be to en­sure that vul­ner­a­ble mi­grant work­ers abroad – many of whom work in ab­ject con­di­tions – are able to vote freely and se­curely.</p>
    <p>“Of­ten their pass­ports are re­tained by their em­ploy­ers and these work­ers can be co­erced into vot­ing ac­cord­ing to their em­ploy­ers’ choice, in­clud­ing through money,” he said. “How does one check these kinds of mal­prac­tices? The ECI does not have the ma­chin­ery to do so abroad.”</p>
    <p>De­tails about how the ECI plans to pro­tect the postal bal­lot vot­ing process for NRIs, in­clud­ing en­sur­ing bal­lot se­crecy, have yet to be made pub­lic. An ECI spokesman re­fused to com­ment any fur­ther on its pro­posal.</p>
    <p>In In­dia, of­fi­cers ap­pointed by the ECI are present at booths to en­sure trans­parency.</p>
    <p>“Not only that, even rep­re­sen­ta­tives of can­di­dates from dif­fer­ent po­lit­i­cal par­ties are at polling booths to en­sure a per­son is prop­erly iden­ti­fied and is not ex­er­cis­ing his or her fran­chise un­der duress,” said Mr Rawat.</p>
    <p>The se­cure elec­tronic de­liv­ery of postal bal­lots for vot­ers cur­rently un­der the ETPBS is pos­si­ble, he added, be­cause all ends are se­cured, in­clud­ing through the armed forces’ cy­ber-se­cu­rity mea­sures. “Whereas for NRIs, it will pass through the free In­ter­net and may be hacked by some peo­ple.”</p>
    <p>These con­cerns were also flagged by Mr Si­taram Yechury, the gen­eral sec­re­tary of the Com­mu­nist Party of In­dia (Marx­ist), in a let­ter to the ECI last Fri­day.</p>
    <p>“Clearly, the is­sue is how to pro­tect the se­crecy and in­tegrity of the bal­lot which will be re­ceived by the in­di­vid­ual elec­tor,” he wrote, call­ing for an all-party meet­ing to dis­cuss the pro­posed move.</p>
    <p>A Bill al­low­ing proxy vot­ing for NRIs, whereby one could del­e­gate his vot­ing right to a rep­re­sen­ta­tive, lapsed with the dis­so­lu­tion of the Lower House of Par­lia­ment in May last year.</p>
    <p>While wel­com­ing the move to in­tro­duce postal bal­lot vot­ing for NRIs, Mr Rawat said it is also im­por­tant to en­sure that do­mes­tic eco­nomic mi­grants, sev­eral mil­lions of whom live and work in places away from where they are reg­is­tered as vot­ers, are also al­lowed to vote through a sim­i­lar process.</p>
