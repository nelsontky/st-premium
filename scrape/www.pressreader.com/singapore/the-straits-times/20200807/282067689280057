    <p>The num­ber of re­sale trans­ac­tions of Hous­ing Board (HDB) flats last month hit the high­est in two years, even as prices crept up, ac­cord­ing to flash data re­leased by real estate por­tal SRX Prop­erty yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>An es­ti­mated 2,470 HDB re­sale flats were sold last month, a 0.7 per cent in­crease from June when 2,453 units were sold.</p>
    <p>July’s sales es­ti­mates are the high­est monthly fig­ures in two years since July 2018, when 2,553 units were trans­acted.</p>
    <p>The high sales for June and July came af­ter ex­cep­tion­ally low num­bers of 423 and 364 flats sold in April and May re­spec­tively, dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker pe­riod that lasted from April 7 to June 1.</p>
    <p>The July sales were con­cluded even as the lat­est es­ti­mates show HDB re­sale prices had in­creased 0.4 per cent last month com­pared with the month be­fore, with the re­sale price in­dex at 132.9 in July, up from 132.3 in June.</p>
    <p>Prop­erty an­a­lysts said that de­spite the bleak eco­nomic out­look, the HDB re­sale mar­ket will likely weather the coro­n­avirus pandemic.</p>
    <p>ERA Realty’s head of re­search and con­sul­tancy Nicholas Mak said: “Some home buy­ers pre­fer to pur­chase HDB flats dur­ing pe­ri­ods of eco­nomic un­cer­tain­ties as they re­main the most af­ford­able hous­ing.”</p>
    <p>He pre­dicted that the re­sale price in­dex is likely to rise grad­u­ally, and es­ti­mated that there would be an in­crease of be­tween 0.6 per cent and 1.2 per cent by the end of this year ow­ing partly to an in­crease in sales of newer flats.</p>
    <p>Ms Wong Siew Ying, head of re­search and con­tent at PropNex, said: “The strong re­sale vol­ume in July would likely put to rest any doubts that June’s sales spike was a blip caused by pent-up de­mand ow­ing to the lock­down in April and May.”</p>
    <p>She added that the fact that HDB prices have held up in the re­cent quar­ters – amid the pandemic – also re­flects the strength of the HDB re­sale mar­ket, where sell­ers still have suf­fi­cient fi­nan­cial hold­ing power and are gen­er­ally able to main­tain their ask­ing prices.</p>
    <p>Ms Chris­tine Sun, head of re­search and con­sul­tancy at OrangeTee & Tie, at­trib­uted the high sales vol­ume to a back­log of trans­ac­tions that were ac­cu­mu­lated dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker pe­riod.</p>
    <p>She added that dur­ing the cur­rent eco­nomic slow­down, HDB re­sale num­bers could re­main high as buy­ers could be look­ing for more af­ford­able homes.</p>
    <p>Last month, four-room units were the most pop­u­lar, mak­ing up 40.1 per cent of the flats sold, fol­lowed by three-room units at 25.1 per cent and five-room flats at 24.3 per cent.</p>
    <p>Ex­ec­u­tive units made up 7.8 per cent, while the rest were two-room and one-room flats.</p>
    <p>Look­ing for­ward, Ms Sun said: “Given that the HDB re­sale mar­ket has not been heav­ily bat­tered by the pandemic, the road to re­cov­ery may not be a lengthy one.”</p>
