    <p>Prime Min­is­ter Muhyid­din Yassin yesterday de­clined to be drawn into what tran­spired in a morn­ing meet­ing be­tween op­po­si­tion leader An­war Ibrahim and the Malaysian King, where Datuk Seri An­war claimed he has ma­jor­ity sup­port from MPs to form a new gov­ern­ment.</p>
    <p>Tan Sri Muhyid­din said he wanted to fo­cus his en­ergy on man­ag­ing the Covid-19 pan­demic and the strug­gling econ­omy.</p>
    <p>“I don’t want to com­ment on what An­war did at the palace. I leave it to the best judg­ment of the Agong (King).</p>
    <p>“He has his own way of do­ing things as pro­vided by the Con­sti­tu­tion,” the Premier said, re­fer­ring to</p>
    <p>Sul­tan Ab­dul­lah Ri’ay­atud­din.</p>
    <p>“My fo­cus is on Covid-19 and man­ag­ing the econ­omy.”</p>
    <p>Mr Muhyid­din spent an hour on Face­book Live field­ing ques­tions from lo­cal me­dia about the pan­demic and the gov­ern­ment’s re­sponse.</p>
    <p>Only one ques­tion near the end of the ses­sion was on the meet­ing be­tween Mr An­war and the King.</p>
    <p>Mr Muhyid­din said at the start of the ses­sion, which be­gan at 5pm, that he knew many jour­nal­ists were keen on his com­ments about the meet­ing at Is­tana Ne­gara.</p>
    <p>But he said he would fo­cus in­stead on the “big­gest is­sues” fac­ing Malaysia – the pan­demic and its im­pact on the coun­try.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing the press con­fer­ence, Mr Muhyid­din fielded mostly ques­tions re­gard­ing the pan­demic and the Con­di­tional Move­ment Con­trol Or­der (CMCO), which comes into ef­fect in Kuala Lumpur, Se­lan­gor and Pu­tra­jaya from mid­night to­day.</p>
    <p>“Due to the high pop­u­la­tion in these ar­eas, we have no­ticed that cases are con­tin­u­ing to climb even in some yel­low zones,” Mr Muhyid­din said, in jus­ti­fy­ing the move­ment curbs that will af­fect some 7.6 mil­lion peo­ple.</p>
    <p>The Klang Val­ley, as Kuala Lumpur, Pu­tra­jaya and the south­ern dis­tricts are called, is Malaysia’s most densely pop­u­lated area – home to over 20 per cent of the coun­try’s pop­u­la­tion.</p>
    <p>Mr Muhyid­din’s gov­ern­ment was pre­vi­ously ques­tioned about its de­ci­sion to im­ple­ment a CMCO for the whole of greater Klang Val­ley, in­stead of tak­ing a tar­geted ap­proach in sev­eral red zones.</p>
    <p>The Na­tional Se­cu­rity Coun­cil later re­leased a set of guide­lines that seemed to in­di­cate a more re­laxed ap­proach to the move­ment curbs in Malaysia’s cap­i­tal.</p>
    <p>It said that dine-in at restau­rants will still be al­lowed, for a max­i­mum of two peo­ple per ta­ble, and that Kuala Lumpur and Se­lan­gor will be con­sid­ered a sin­gle zone for trav­el­ling.</p>
    <p>There were 660 new coro­n­avirus cases recorded yesterday, the sec­ond-high­est for the coun­try. Se­lan­gor recorded 74 cases, con­tin­u­ing a re­cent up­ward trend.</p>
    <p>Mr Muhyid­din also said Malaysia has been granted pri­or­ity by China to re­ceive the lat­ter’s coro­n­avirus vac­cines when they are avail­able.</p>
    <p>“The Chi­nese For­eign Min­is­ter has agreed to pri­ori­tise Malaysia to make sure we are among the first ones to re­ceive the vac­cine when it be­comes avail­able,” he said, re­fer­ring to Mr Wang Yi.</p>
