    <p>Darter Paul Lim’s abil­ity to de­liver sur­prises on the big stage just does not get old, as the 66-year-old Sin­ga­porean pro­duced yet an­other shock on Fri­day at the Pro­fes­sional Darts Cor­po­ra­tion (PDC) World Cham­pi­onship in London.</p>
    <p>Up against world No. 34 Luke Humphries in the first round, Lim came from 2-0 down to beat the English­man 3-2 (1-3, 1-3, 3-1, 3-2, 3-1) in the closed-door en­counter at Alexan­dra Palace.</p>
    <p>Humphries, 24, had made the quar­ter-fi­nals for the past two years and won the 2019 PDC World Youth Cham­pi­onship.</p>
    <p>In a post-match in­ter­view, Lim, who is the old­est com­peti­tor in the tour­na­ment, joked that his win was “one for the old guys”.</p>
    <p>He later told The Sun­day Times: “It was the sec­ond-last match of the night... I was locked in and pumped up, and did not feel tired at the oche even if it was a tough and crazy match.</p>
    <p>“It’s about pas­sion and prac­tice. I made my fair share of misses but ex­pe­ri­ence also got me through crit­i­cal mo­ments.”</p>
    <p>Lim, un­ranked as he does not play on the Pro­fes­sional Darts Cor­po­ra­tion Pro Tour, will face world No. 9 Dim­itri van den Bergh, an­other world youth cham­pion (2017 and 2018), in the sec­ond round on Tues­day. The Bel­gian, 26, made the last eight in two of the past three edi­tions and is the cur­rent World Match­play cham­pion.</p>
    <p>Af­ter com­ing through the Hong Kong leg of the Asian qual­i­fiers, this is Lim’s 25th world cham­pi­onship cam­paign. In the 2018 edi­tion, he beat 2008 Bri­tish Darts Or­gan­i­sa­tion world cham­pion Mark Web­ster in the first round.</p>
    <p>Since 2014, he and Harith Lim, 50, have also com­bined to beat higher-ranked op­po­nents at the an­nual World Cup of Darts. In 2017, the un­seeded pair out­gunned topseed Scot­land – boast­ing then­world No. 2 Gary An­der­son and No. 3 Peter Wright – 5-2 in the first round, be­fore over­com­ing Spain 2-1 to reach the quar­ter-fi­nals.</p>
    <p>In 2018, the el­der Lim beat reign­ing world darts cham­pion Rob Cross 4-2 en route to a sec­on­dround de­feat by sec­ond-seed Eng­land. The Sin­ga­pore­ans were at it again last year when they beat third seeds Wales, who had then­world No. 5 Ger­wyn Price and world No. 24 Jonny Clay­ton.</p>
    <p>Train­ing and winning never gets old for Lim and he has no fear, de­spite not be­ing able to com­pete as much as his younger and more il­lus­tri­ous ri­vals, who were able to play on the Euro­pean cir­cuit dur­ing the coro­n­avirus pan­demic while he was mostly in­doors in Hong Kong.</p>
    <p>He dou­bled his prac­tice hours from three on elec­tronic darts to six on steel-tip. He said: “If I can take what I have been prac­tis­ing to the tour­na­ment board, I will have a chance to win.</p>
    <p>“Dim­itri and I are good friends... I take my hat off to him for jump­ing to the top and do­ing so well in such a short pe­riod of time.</p>
    <p>“My aim is try and put a stop to that. I just want to put on a good show and play a good game. Hope­fully, vic­tory be­comes mine.”</p>
