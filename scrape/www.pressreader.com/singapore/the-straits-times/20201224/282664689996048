    <p>1 TA­BLE SCREEN: GATH­ER­ING OF SCHOL­ARS, CHINA Mid-18th cen­tury, lac­quered wood</p>
    <p>Cu­ra­tor Kan Shuyi likens this screen to an “an­tique tele­vi­sion”. This is an op­por­tu­nity to see both the front and back of the piece as it is dis­played in a stand­alone vit­rine.</p>
    <p>The two sides de­pict dif­fer­ent scenes and it is the side which shows a fa­mous 4th-cen­tury lit­er­ary party at the Orchid Pav­il­ion that in­trigues Ms Kan.</p>
    <p>She says the ro­man­ti­cised por­trayal is be­guil­ing.</p>
    <p>“To be away from the daily hus­tle and bus­tle and com­pose po­etry, sur­rounded by friends, na­ture and the cool­ness of early spring, is a lovely es­cape.”</p>
    <p>2 SEATED BUD­DHA, SHAN STATE OR BA­GAN (MYAN­MAR) 18th cen­tury mar­ble with traces of lac­quer, paint and gold leaf</p>
    <p>Ms Birte Koehler, se­nior con­ser­va­tor (ob­jects) at the Her­itage Con­ser­va­tion Cen­tre, cred­its this item for in­spir­ing her long ex­plo­ration of the art of Asian lac­quer.</p>
    <p>She ar­rived in Sin­ga­pore in 2012 to work at the cen­tre and an ACM cu­ra­tor asked her to de­ter­mine whether the brown traces on the statue were Asian lac­quer or or­di­nary paint.</p>
    <p>She dis­cov­ered that the brown residue com­prised some six to eight lay­ers of lac­quer, which piqued her cu­rios­ity about this an­cient Asian craft.</p>
    <p>She has since trav­elled through South-east Asia and Ja­pan to find crafts­men who are still us­ing this tech­nique. “When­ever I see this Bud­dha sculp­ture, I re­mem­ber how much I have learnt and broad­ened my hori­zos since I ar­rived in Sin­ga­pore.”</p>
    <p>3 TILE PANEL, IRAN 18TH CEN­TURY (SAFAVID PE­RIOD) Glazed frit­ware</p>
    <p>This is the first time this new ac­qui­si­tion, which ar­rived in Jan­uary, is on dis­play. This ar­chi­tec­tural fea­ture might have adorned a gar­den pav­il­ion at one point. It de­picts the fruit-cut­ting scene from the life of the prophet Yusuf (Joseph).</p>
    <p>Ms Noorashiki­n Zulk­i­fli, the mu­seum’s cu­ra­tor of Is­lamic art, says the “swoon­ing women” in this piece caught her eye. Yusuf is shown as a youth in a blue coat with yel­low boteh (al­mond-shaped) mo­tifs, bring­ing to mind the mu­si­cal Joseph And The Tech­ni­colour Dream­coat.</p>
    <p>“This is what fas­ci­nates me,” says the cu­ra­tor, “how sto­ries sur­vive and be­come part of our shared culture.”</p>
    <p>4 HOT­POT, CHINA, QING DY­NASTY, QIANLONG PE­RIOD (1736 TO 1795) Painted enamel on cop­per</p>
    <p>Trust hote­lier and res­tau­ra­teur Loh Lik Peng to zoom in on a food-re­lated item.</p>
    <p>This in­tri­cately dec­o­rated hot­pot caught the ACM board chair­man’s at­ten­tion a few years ago when it was dis­played in the trade gallery. He says: “As a foodie and some­one who ap­pre­ci­ates beau­ti­ful things, it was just strik­ing to me that some­one would de­sign and make some­thing so ex­quis­ite for eat­ing hot­pot.”</p>
    <p>He ob­serves that “a lot of painstak­ing work” must have gone into the mak­ing of this pot. “I can’t help but think how deca­dent their so­ci­ety was by that point in the Qing dy­nasty.</p>
    <p>“It’s also highly im­prac­ti­cal as a cook­ing im­ple­ment, which tells me they must have had a highly stylised rit­ual around eat­ing and per­haps a strong cul­tural link to food and eat­ing.”</p>
    <p>5 WEN PENG’S LET­TER TO QIANGU, CHINA, MING DY­NASTY (1368 TO 1644) Ink on pa­per</p>
    <p>A se­ries of five let­ters on dis­play in thINK of­fer in­sights into what some fa­mous per­son­al­i­ties thought about so­cial and po­lit­i­cal is­sues of their time.</p>
    <p>Culture vul­tures will be amused by this let­ter, writ­ten by Wen Peng, a fa­mous maker of seals whose father Wen Zheng Ming was one of the Four Masters of Ming paint­ing. Ad­dressed to Qian Gu, Wen Zheng Ming’s dis­ci­ple, it speaks of the flour­ish­ing art trade where a work could fetch up to 10 times its orig­i­nal price.</p>
