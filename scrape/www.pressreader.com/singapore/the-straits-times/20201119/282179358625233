    <p>The pro­posed amal­ga­ma­tion of loss-mak­ing Lak­shmi Vi­las Bank (LVB) into DBS Bank’s In­dian unit may weigh on the Sin­ga­pore lender’s prof­itabil­ity in the medium term.</p>
    <p>It also raises ques­tions about DBS’ div­i­dend tra­jec­tory given the im­pend­ing pan­demic-re­lated credit risks, said Jef­feries Eq­uity Re­search yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Jef­feries an­a­lyst Kr­ishna Guha has down­graded DBS from “buy” to “hold” and low­ered the es­ti­mates for its div­i­dends per share by about 10 per cent.</p>
    <p>He cut the tar­get price from $26 to $22. DBS shares closed down 0.08 per cent to $24.63 yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>LVB may be folded into DBS’ In­dian unit un­der a scheme de­vised by In­dia’s cen­tral bank, DBS said on Tues­day night.</p>
    <p>DBS will in­ject 25 bil­lion rupees (S$452 mil­lion) of fresh cap­i­tal into DBS Bank In­dia if the scheme is ap­proved. This will be fully funded from ex­ist­ing re­sources.</p>
    <p>JPMor­gan’s re­search team noted yes­ter­day that the pro­posed deal will likely be pos­i­tive: “Ef­fec­tively, DBS is buy­ing the (LVB) busi­ness at about 10 per cent of cur­rent de­posits.”</p>
    <p>More­over, as soon as a cred­i­ble con­trol­ling share­holder comes in, the LVB fran­chise will likely start re­gain­ing de­posit mar­ket share. JPMor­gan also ex­pects DBS to use its dig­i­tal ca­pa­bil­i­ties to en­hance its phys­i­cal foot­print in In­dia, which could lead to a 30 per cent to 40 per cent in­crease in its In­dian as­sets.</p>
    <p>The deal will boost DBS’ foot­print in south­ern In­dia, which has long­stand­ing and close busi­ness ties with Sin­ga­pore, Mr Guha said.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore real es­tate firms in par­tic­u­lar have re­cently deep­ened their pres­ence in south­ern In­dia.</p>
    <p>DBS has also noted the need to scale up its branch pres­ence to tar­get small and medium-sized en­ter­prise lend­ing.</p>
    <p>How­ever, scal­ing up will weigh on DBS’ prof­itabil­ity and ef­fi­ciency, Mr Guha said.</p>
    <p>LVB has not been able to raise ad­e­quate cap­i­tal to ad­dress is­sues around its neg­a­tive net worth and con­tin­u­ing losses and is ex­pe­ri­enc­ing con­tin­u­ous de­posit with­drawals and low lev­els of liq­uid­ity.</p>
    <p>The gov­ern­ment has also tem­po­rar­ily capped with­drawals.</p>
    <p>LVB has been look­ing for a part­ner since last year amid surg­ing bad loans that come on top of “gov­er­nance is­sues”, Reuters said.</p>
    <p>JPMor­gan said the up­side for DBS will rest on its abil­ity to con­sol­i­date LVB, at­tract de­posits and gen­er­ate con­sis­tent re­turns while main­tain­ing credit risk.</p>
    <p>Pro­vi­sions will also need to be re­duced “dra­mat­i­cally” soon, which the JPMor­gan an­a­lysts see as likely be­cause al­most the en­tire amount of non-per­form­ing loans (NPLs) will be writ­ten off.</p>
    <p>“We be­lieve DBS has built un­der­writ­ing or risk man­age­ment ca­pa­bil­i­ties in In­dia in the last few years. Those have led to a rel­a­tively re­silient NPL out­come,” they noted.</p>
    <p>“These at­tributes, com­bined with dig­i­tal of­fer­ings, should al­low the bank to de­liver (re­sults) at least in line with its his­tor­i­cal out­come.”</p>
    <p>If this th­e­sis plays out, DBS will see value ac­cre­tion from the pro­posed trans­ac­tion, JPMor­gan said.</p>
    <p>Jef­feries said the new en­tity will have the most branches in the coun­try – 598 – and rank fifth by loans among for­eign banks.</p>
    <p>“We un­der­stand DBS may have the flex­i­bil­ity to ra­tio­nalise branch foot­print and avail other con­ces­sions,” Mr Guha said.</p>
    <p>DBS said on Tues­day that it will wait for the fi­nal de­ci­sion from the In­dian au­thor­i­ties be­fore an­nounc­ing fur­ther de­tails.</p>
    <p>For­tune favours the brave, as the say­ing goes.</p>
    <p>The ques­tion for DBS is whether the Re­serve Bank of In­dia’s call to amal­ga­mate trou­bled Lak­shmi Vi­las Bank (LVB) with the Sin­ga­pore bank has for­tune writ­ten all over it.</p>
    <p>The pro­posed amal­ga­ma­tion would ef­fec­tively and sig­nif­i­cantly in­crease DBS’ foot­print in the south­ern re­gion of the world’s se­cond-most pop­u­lous na­tion. First, the pos­i­tives.</p>
    <p>LVB has a 94-year his­tory in In­dia, with an es­tab­lished re­tail and small-busi­ness base and a strong pres­ence in the state of Tamil Nadu in South In­dia.</p>
    <p>It has ex­panded rapidly be­yond Tamil Nadu over the past four decades and now has branches and op­er­a­tions in Andhra Pradesh, Kar­nataka and Ker­ala, fi­nan­cial hubs such as Mum­bai, New Delhi and Kolkata, and other sig­nif­i­cant busi­ness cen­tres in Ma­ha­rash­tra, Gu­jarat and Mad­hya Pradesh.</p>
    <p>It also has the req­ui­site li­cences to pro­vide for­eign ex­change ser­vices to cus­tomers en­gaged in in­ter­na­tional trade and to over­seas trav­ellers.</p>
    <p>LVB has a net­work of over 550 branches and more than 900</p>
    <p>ATMs across In­dia, and a de­posit base of over 200 bil­lion rupees (S$3.6 bil­lion).</p>
    <p>After a pe­riod of public feed­back that ends to­mor­row, the cen­tral bank will pro­ceed with its next move. If the merger is ap­proved, DBS In­dia will ac­quire LVB and its as­sets for a mere 25 bil­lion rupees.</p>
    <p>This is where DBS share­hold­ers will want to know the value propo­si­tion of a takeover.</p>
    <p>LVB has been los­ing money for the past three years.</p>
    <p>The cen­tral bank is­sued a no­ti­fi­ca­tion on Tues­day declar­ing that LVB was in dire fi­nan­cial straits and did not have suf­fi­cient funds to pay off its de­pos­i­tors. It also im­posed a month-long mora­to­rium un­der which de­pos­i­tors are able to with­draw just 25,000 rupees.</p>
    <p>“The fi­nan­cial po­si­tion of Lak­shmi Vi­las Bank has un­der­gone a steady de­cline with the bank in­cur­ring losses over the last three years, erod­ing its net worth,” it said.</p>
    <p>With “the ab­sence of any vi­able strate­gic plan, de­clin­ing ad­vances and mount­ing non-per­form­ing as­sets, the losses are ex­pected to con­tinue”.</p>
    <p>So why would DBS In­dia want to get into this deal? And why did the cen­tral bank choose DBS In­dia?</p>
    <p>DBS is South-east Asia’s big­gest and best cap­i­talised bank. In In­dia – where it has had a pres­ence since 1994, and is one of only two for­eign banks with wholly owned sub­sidiary sta­tus – its unit’s Tier 1 cap­i­tal stands at 12.84 per cent, which is 5.5 per cent above reg­u­la­tory re­quire­ments.</p>
    <p>DBS In­dia has op­er­a­tions in 24 cities across 13 states, and was sit­ting pretty on cap­i­tal of</p>
    <p>71.09 bil­lion rupees as at June 30.</p>
    <p>On the other hand, most In­dian banks are in dire need of cap­i­tal. The gen­eral im­pres­sion, speak­ing to bankers here, is that their loan books are gen­er­ally weak.</p>
    <p>Still, given Sin­ga­pore’s strong tra­di­tional and busi­ness links to South In­dia, where most Sin­ga­pore­ans of In­dian an­ces­try trace their roots, it makes sense for DBS to ex­pand its re­tail net­work there.</p>
    <p>Also, DBS has been look­ing to In­dia, In­done­sia and China – Asia’s three most pop­u­lous na­tions – as its key off­shore mar­kets for long-term sus­tain­able growth.</p>
    <p>But its record has been che­quered.</p>
    <p>Its at­tempt to take over Bank Dana­mon in 2013 was scut­tled by na­tion­al­is­tic sen­ti­ments in In­done­sia. It man­aged to buy Dao Heng in Hong Kong in 2001 but took al­most 15 years to in­te­grate it and gain mar­ket share in North-east Asia.</p>
    <p>In­dia is no easy mar­ket. Clinch­ing a big­ger branch net­work in Asia’s se­cond-most pop­u­lous na­tion is one thing but bal­ance sheet is­sues are quite an­other.</p>
    <p>As JP Mor­gan noted yes­ter­day, with 25 per cent gross non-per­form­ing loans (NPLs) and 60 per cent cov­er­age and 1.12 per cent cap­i­tal ad­e­quacy ra­tio, LVB is ef­fec­tively run­ning at zero to neg­a­tive eq­uity. And LVB’s equiv­a­lent of $4.6 bil­lion in as­sets rep­re­sents a mere 0.8 per cent of DBS Group’s as­sets.</p>
    <p>DBS In­dia would have to take on LVB’s huge li­a­bil­i­ties and pos­si­bly do a man­age­ment shake­down and ra­tio­nal­i­sa­tion in In­dia – some­thing that has never been easy to do in cor­po­rate In­dia dur­ing the best of times.</p>
    <p>But DBS has the fi­nan­cial fire­power to right the LVB ship, if given the op­por­tu­nity.</p>
    <p>Still, some hard ques­tions have to be asked about the group’s ac­cre­tive strat­egy.</p>
    <p>What is DBS’ strate­gic in­tent for this merger/takeover?</p>
    <p>Does it want to be a re­tail bank, a wealth ad­viser or a com­mer­cial bank in In­dia? How does LVB aug­ment this strat­egy?</p>
    <p>Is LVB’s branch net­work a crit­i­cal as­set for DBS In­dia, and for what pur­pose?</p>
    <p>What is the brand strat­egy?</p>
    <p>Also, given LVB’s cur­rent sit­u­a­tion, in terms of books, clients and em­ploy­ees, what will be the true cost of re­struc­tur­ing, and can DBS get the req­ui­site reg­u­la­tory ap­proval to push through the fixes?</p>
    <p>There are many ques­tions the folks at DBS have to pon­der.</p>
    <p>One other ques­tion is, why did In­dia’s cen­tral bank choose DBS In­dia? Is it be­cause most other In­dian banks would not be fi­nan­cially ca­pa­ble of res­cu­ing LVB, or are sim­ply not in­ter­ested in this deal?</p>
    <p>But as JP Mor­gan noted, if DBS can con­sol­i­date the fran­chise and at­tract de­posits, re­duce pro­vi­sions dra­mat­i­cally in the near term (which can be done as al­most the en­tire amount of NPLs will be writ­ten off) and gen­er­ate con­sis­tent re­turns there­after while main­tain­ing credit risk, the deal would be value ac­cre­tive and open up the pos­si­bil­ity for DBS to scale up in In­dia.</p>
    <p>The cen­tral bank ex­pects the merged en­tity to have a cap­i­tal ad­e­quacy ra­tio of 12.51 per cent and com­mon eq­uity Tier 1 cap­i­tal of 9.61 per cent.</p>
    <p>It must also be noted that DBS has sig­nif­i­cant dig­i­tal bank­ing ca­pa­bil­i­ties to sig­nif­i­cantly scale up the merged en­tity’s op­er­a­tions and raise its com­pet­i­tive­ness.</p>
    <p>Jef­feries reck­ons the pro­posed merger is a win-win sit­u­a­tion for both banks.</p>
    <p>“It will al­low DBS Bank In­dia to ex­pand into small and medium-sized en­ter­prise and re­tail bank­ing, while bail­ing out LVB in the process,” the bro­ker­age noted, adding that DBS’ 35-branch net­work in In­dia is much smaller than that of HSBC, Citibank and Stan­dard Char­tered.</p>
    <p>But for the mo­ment, these are all the­o­ret­i­cal. Mean­while there are many scep­tics out there.</p>
    <p>Yes, for­tune favours the brave. But as an­other say­ing goes, one should not be a hostage to for­tune.</p>
