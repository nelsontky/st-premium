    <p>Orthodon­tic treat­ment has long been one of the prici­est op­tions in den­tal care but Sin­ga­pore-based start-up Zenyum is look­ing to change that.</p>
    <p>Ger­man co-founder and chief ex­ec­u­tive Ju­lian Ar­tope told The Straits Times: “Our main aim is to pro­vide an af­ford­able so­lu­tion for straight­en­ing teeth, while still be­ing a re­li­able part­ner to lo­cal den­tists and mak­ing sure we don’t com­pro­mise safety and su­per­vi­sion of treat­ment.”</p>
    <p>The firm’s in­vis­i­ble braces treat­ment costs about $2,400, well un­der the $8,000 or so for mar­ket leader In­visalign’s.</p>
    <p>Zenyum keeps the cost lower than tra­di­tional play­ers by pro­duc­ing its align­ers within South-east Asia and re­motely mon­i­tor­ing how a pa­tient’s teeth are mov­ing through an app.</p>
    <p>Cus­tomers save on con­sul­ta­tion fees as they see the or­tho­don­tist in per­son only at the start and end of their treat­ment.</p>
    <p>The app re­minds them when to switch to a new set of align­ers.</p>
    <p>Tra­di­tional treat­ment in­volves see­ing the or­tho­don­tist for reg­u­lar ad­just­ments, usu­ally monthly.</p>
    <p>Mr Ar­tope said the firm is not prof­itable yet, but has been grow­ing about 20 per cent to 30 per cent month on month.</p>
    <p>It has close to 200 em­ploy­ees across its seven mar­kets – Sin­ga­pore, Hong Kong, In­done­sia, Malaysia, Tai­wan, Thai­land and Viet­nam.</p>
    <p>“While we see strong ini­tial trac­tion in the more de­vel­oped mar­kets like Sin­ga­pore, we are build</p>
    <p>ing a com­pany for the long term and have con­vic­tion on the po­ten­tial of the en­tire re­gion,” Mr Ar­tope added.</p>
    <p>Zenyum has raised about US$16 mil­lion (S$21.6 mil­lion), al­though most of these funds have not been touched yet, he noted.</p>
    <p>Its in­vestors in­clude ven­ture cap­i­tal firms Se­quoia In­dia and RT Global and gov­ern­ment agency En­ter­prise Sin­ga­pore’s in­vest­ment arm, Seeds Cap­i­tal.</p>
    <p>The firm’s three co-founders also put in around $100,000 in to­tal to start the com­pany in 2018, said Mr Ar­tope.</p>
    <p>Be­sides its in­vis­i­ble braces, Zenyum has ex­panded into other prod­ucts such as elec­tric tooth­brushes and teeth whiten­ing kits, which are dis­trib­uted on­line and through re­tail phar­ma­cies.</p>
    <p>Like most firms, it saw its fair share of dis­rup­tions early this year, es­pe­cially with part­ner clin­ics hav­ing to shut for some time amid lock­downs and cir­cuit breaker mea­sures across the re­gion.</p>
    <p>The com­pany coped by of­fer­ing re­mote con­sul­ta­tions and tech­nol­ogy sup­port to its part­ners, Mr Ar­tope said.</p>
    <p>Build­ing trust with cus­tomers,</p>
    <p>the au­thor­i­ties and other stake­hold­ers as a new name, es­pe­cially in the health­care space, was one of the com­pany’s main chal­lenges at the start, he added.</p>
    <p>Mr Ar­tope said: “For us, the way to go was to be highly trans­par­ent about our pro­cesses and ad­here fully to ex­ist­ing reg­u­la­tions.</p>
    <p>“Our pa­tients and part­ner den­tists see and ap­pre­ci­ate this, and while we still get many ques­tions about the ori­gins and set-up of our busi­ness, our trans­parency has helped to build this trust.”</p>
