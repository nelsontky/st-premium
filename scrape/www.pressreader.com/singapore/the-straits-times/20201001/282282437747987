    <p>PARIS • Mick Schu­macher will take part in first Fri­day prac­tice with Alfa Romeo at the Nur­bur­gring next week as Fer­rari seek to give their three lead­ing ju­nior driv­ers For­mula One race week­end ex­pe­ri­ence.</p>
    <p>Bri­tain’s Cal­lum Ilott will take part in the same ses­sion with the Fer­rari-powered Haas team, while Rus­sian Robert Shwartz­man will get his chance on the fi­nal Fri­day of the sea­son in Abu Dhabi with Haas or Alfa.</p>
    <p>Schu­macher, son of Fer­rari great and seven-time world cham­pion Michael, is lead­ing the For­mula Two standings ahead of the Eifel Grand Prix week­end at the Ger­man cir­cuit.</p>
    <p>“The fact that my first par­tic­i­pa­tion in a For­mula One week­end will take place in front of my home au­di­ence at the Nur­bur­gring makes this mo­ment even more spe­cial,” said Schu­macher, 21.</p>
    <p>“I am over­joyed to get this chance. I’m go­ing to pre­pare my­self well, so that I can do the best pos­si­ble job for the team and gain some valu­able data for the week­end.”</p>
    <p>Fer­rari-powered Alfa Romeo and Haas both have po­ten­tial va­can­cies for 2021. Ac­cord­ing to The Guardian, nei­ther team have con­cluded a new con­tract with any of</p>
    <p>their driv­ers for next year and at least one of the Fer­rari ju­nior driv­ers can be ex­pected to take one of the four seats avail­able.</p>
    <p>Alfa Romeo will re­port­edly an­nounce their line-up for next sea­son af­ter the Oct 9 Grand Prix and are thought to be keen on pro­mot­ing Schu­macher from F2 to F1.</p>
    <p>All three Fer­rari academy driv­ers will also test a 2018 Fer­rari SF71H at the Ital­ian team’s Fio­rano track on Wednesday in prepa­ra­tion for their F1 prac­tice de­buts, hav­ing al­ready had seat fit­tings.</p>
    <p>Schu­macher and Ilott have driven F1 cars be­fore in test ses­sions, while Schu­macher also drove his fa­ther’s 2004 Fer­rari around the Mugello cir­cuit this month at a Tus­can Grand Prix cel­e­brat­ing the Ital­ian team’s 1,000th F1 race.</p>
    <p>“We wanted to or­gan­ise this test ses­sion so that our three best young­sters would be as well pre­pared as pos­si­ble,” said Fer­rari sport­ing direc­tor Lau­rent Mekies.</p>
    <p>“We be­lieve strongly in our academy, which has al­ready proved its value with Charles Le­clerc a driver on which the Scud­e­ria can build its long-term fu­ture.”</p>
