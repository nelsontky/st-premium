    <p>•</p>
    <p>LON­DON Harry Kane has been Tot­ten­ham Hot­spur’s lead­ing marks­man for the last six sea­sons, but af­ter be­com­ing the first English­man to make four as­sists in one Premier League match at Southamp­ton yes­ter­day, the striker showed there is more to his game than goals.</p>
    <p>With Gareth Bale signed to pro­vide fur­ther com­pe­ti­tion for places in at­tack at Spurs, the cur­rent strike force made a real state­ment in the 5-2 win at St Mary’s.</p>
    <p>Son He­ung-min will grab the head­lines for his four-goal haul and a first Premier League hat-trick, but the qual­ity of the ser­vice also de­serves high praise.</p>
    <p>Each Kane as­sist was im­pres­sive in its own right, with the fi­nal pass for Son’s fourth the pick of the bunch as he clipped a curl­ing cross into the South Korean’s path on the run with­out even look­ing.</p>
    <p>“Four amaz­ing as­sists from Harry, he de­serves the man of the match award,” Son said of Kane, who scored the fifth goal.</p>
    <p>“We have been work­ing for five sea­sons to­gether now. We know what we like and work hard on our re­la­tion­ship on and off the pitch. Hope­fully, there are many more goals to come.”</p>
    <p>Spurs man­ager Jose Mour­inho was equally ful­some in his praise.</p>
    <p>“In the sec­ond half, Harry Kane killed the game, the way he was drop­ping, he al­lowed Son He­ung­min into at­tack­ing spa­ces,” he said.</p>
    <p>“He is man of the match for what he did for the team. Some­times peo­ple think strik­ers just score goals, but he cre­ates a whole new dy­namic they (Saints) could not re­solve.”</p>
    <p>Be­fore the trip to Southamp­ton, Kane, for all his bril­liance in front of goal, had pro­vided only eight league as­sists in the last three sea­sons. In com­par­i­son to other lead­ing cen­tral strik­ers in the Premier League – Ser­gio Aguero (17), Jamie Vardy (14) and Pierre-Em­er­ick Aubameyang (11) – that as­sist re­turn was not im­pres­sive.</p>
    <p>How­ever, with Son in red-hot form on one side, and Bale de­ter­mined to make an im­pres­sion on the other, Kane’s creative tal­ents could be­come a more reg­u­lar fea­ture of Tot­ten­ham’s play.</p>
    <p>The Spurs cap­tain felt that Son’s pace and move­ment was cer­tain to ex­ploit Southamp­ton’s risky high de­fen­sive line. “We knew there was go­ing to be space be­hind and we were talk­ing about Sonny get­ting in there if I dropped deeper,” he said.</p>
    <p>“For one of the passes I didn’t look, I just knew he would be run­ning be­hind. That’s the con­nec­tion we’ve been build­ing and it’s nice to see him fin­ish them off.”</p>
    <p>The score­line flat­tered Tot­ten­ham, who had only five shots on tar­get – two fewer than Southamp­ton, who had two goals from Danny Ings – but their clin­i­cal fin­ish­ing made all the dif­fer­ence.</p>
    <p>“Our heads dropped af­ter their goal in the first half and we gave in too easy,” Saints man­ager Ralph Hasen­huttl said. “The de­fend­ing was a dis­as­ter.”</p>
    <p>Mean­while, Dele Alli’s Spurs fu­ture is i n doubt af­ter he was dropped for the match.</p>
    <p>The mid­fielder was sub­sti­tuted at half-time of Tot­ten­ham’s 1-0 loss to Ever­ton last week­end and was miss­ing from the squad for their Europa League 2-1 qual­i­fy­ing win against Loko­mo­tiv Plov­div on Thurs­day.</p>
    <p>Mour­inho sug­gested there was no guar­an­tee he would get back in the team any time soon.</p>
    <p>“No. We have a huge squad, a squad with num­bers that are very dif­fi­cult to man­age,” he said.</p>
    <p>“We have too many play­ers for some po­si­tions and some of them are pay­ing the price for this.”</p>
