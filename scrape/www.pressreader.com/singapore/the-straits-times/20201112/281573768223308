    <p>The po­lice have launched an in­ves­ti­ga­tion af­ter re­ports were made over the use of funds in­tended for the Pen­te­costal Church of Sin­ga­pore. Sev­eral staff of the church in Tai Gin Road, and its fol­low­ers, have al­leged that money meant for the church was used for pur­poses that are not re­lated to its run­ning.</p>
    <p>The po­lice have launched an in­ves­ti­ga­tion af­ter re­ports were made over the use of funds in­tended for the Pen­te­costal Church of Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>Sev­eral staff of the church in Tai Gin Road, and its fol­low­ers, have al­leged that money meant for the church was used for pur­poses that are not re­lated to its run­ning.</p>
    <p>They al­lege that at least $25,000 in to­tal was with­drawn ei­ther by the pas­tor, or un­der his di­rec­tion, with­out their con­sent.</p>
    <p>The church fol­lows The Pen­te­costal Mis­sion, which is head­quar­tered in Chen­nai, In­dia.</p>
    <p>Mem­bers of the clergy are ex­pected to be celi­bate, obey el­der pas­tors and prac­tise com­mu­nal liv­ing in church by get­ting rid of pri­vate pos­ses­sions.</p>
    <p>In four po­lice re­ports seen by The Straits Times, for­mer and cur­rent clergy mem­bers of the church al­leged that Pas­tor M. Joshua Thi­a­gara­jan, 57, had with­drawn their money with­out their con­sent or a ver­i­fi­able ex­pla­na­tion af­ter they pro­vided their bank ac­count de­tails in­clud­ing PIN (per­sonal iden­ti­fi­ca­tion num­ber) to the church on his in­struc­tion.</p>
    <p>They signed con­sent forms to al­low the church to use their money only for its pur­poses, and only Mr Thi­a­gara­jan is said to have had ac­cess to their bank ac­counts.</p>
    <p>The money is said to have been with­drawn from the var­i­ous ac­counts from as early as May 2016.</p>
    <p>The po­lice re­ports were filed in June and July this year, and the po­lice con­firmed that they are in­ves­ti­gat­ing the in­ci­dent.</p>
    <p>They added that church staff are as­sist­ing in the probe.</p>
    <p>When asked about the in­ci­dent, the Com­mis­sioner of Char­i­ties (COC), Mr Des­mond Chin, said he is aware that staff of the Pen­te­costal Church of Sin­ga­pore are cur­rently as­sist­ing with po­lice in­ves­ti­ga­tions.</p>
    <p>“While the in­ves­ti­ga­tions are on­go­ing, the COC’s of­fice is mon­i­tor­ing the op­er­a­tions of the Pen­te­costal Church of Sin­ga­pore, and where nec­es­sary, will take reg­u­la­tory ac­tion un­der the Char­i­ties Act,” he added.</p>
    <p>The church is not a mem­ber of the Na­tional Coun­cil of Churches of Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>When ST con­tacted Mr Thi­a­gara­jan last month about the al­le­ga­tions, he ini­tially de­nied any knowl­edge. But when quizzed about the po­lice in­ves­ti­ga­tion, he said he is not sup­posed to com­ment.</p>
    <p>Church­go­ers told ST that the al­le­ga­tions have out­raged many in the 500-strong con­gre­ga­tion, which in­cludes low-wage for­eign work­ers who give 10 per cent of their in­come as part of tithe.</p>
    <p>A 65-year-old re­tiree, who has at­tended the church for over a decade and de­clined to be named, said: “While we have grown spir­i­tu­ally (at the church)... the things that have been go­ing on in the church have re­ally turned our lives up­side down.”</p>
    <p>When ST vis­ited the church last Tues­day, the gates were locked and a no­tice out­side said that ow­ing to Covid-19 mea­sures, no vis­its or gath­er­ings in the church were al­lowed with­out prior per­mis­sion.</p>
    <p>In four po­lice re­ports seen by The Straits Times, for­mer and cur­rent clergy mem­bers of the church al­leged that Pas­tor M. Joshua Thi­a­gara­jan (above), 57, had with­drawn their money with­out their con­sent or a ver­i­fi­able ex­pla­na­tion af­ter they pro­vided their bank ac­count de­tails in­clud­ing PIN to the church on his in­struc­tion.</p>
