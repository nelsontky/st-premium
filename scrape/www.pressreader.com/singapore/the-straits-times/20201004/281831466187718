    <p>Fam­ily mem­bers of op­er­a­tionally ready na­tional ser­vice­men (NS­men) will have free mem­ber­ship at Safra and HomeTeamNS, with fees waived for sec­ond and sub­se­quent de­pen­dants.</p>
    <p>Ap­pli­cants will not need to pay the ad­min­is­tra­tive fee of $10 for each reg­is­tra­tion till March 31 next year.</p>
    <p>This new fam­ily mem­ber­ship scheme for Safra and HomeTeamNS is aimed at pro­mot­ing fam­ily bond­ing, said Se­nior Min­is­ter of State for De­fence and Safra pres­i­dent Zaqy Mohamad yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>“Es­pe­cially dur­ing this pan­demic, where many are prob­a­bly look­ing for places to spend fam­ily time to­gether... our NS­men can use this op­por­tu­nity to ex­plore some of the fa­cil­i­ties that we have across our Safra club­houses,” Mr Zaqy told the me­dia dur­ing a tour of the Safra Yishun club­house.</p>
    <p>Only the first de­pen­dant has to pay to be a mem­ber.</p>
    <p>NS­men pay fees from $80 for a Safra mem­ber­ship, and from $40 for their first de­pen­dant. The HomeTeamNS’ mem­ber­ship fee starts from $50 for the NS­men, and from $20 for the first de­pen­dant.</p>
    <p>Only spouses of NS­men and their chil­dren aged be­low 20 can reg­is­ter as de­pen­dants.</p>
    <p>The pool of de­pen­dant mem­bers at Safra is ex­pected to dou­ble to 150,000 in the next five years with this scheme.</p>
    <p>HomeTeamNS es­ti­mates its num­ber of de­pen­dant mem­bers to grow to 75,000 in the next five years, up from the cur­rent 18,000.</p>
    <p>Mr Zaqy said that Safra and HomeTeamNS have the ca­pac­ity to ac­com­mo­date the grow­ing num­bers.</p>
    <p>Safra cur­rently has six club­houses – in Jurong, Mount Faber, Pung­gol, Tampines, Toa Payoh and Yishun. HomeTeamNS has club­houses in Balestier, Bukit Ba­tok, Chi­na­town, Khatib and Tampines.</p>
    <p>A Safra club­house in Choa Chu Kang and a HomeTeamNS club­house in Be­dok are ex­pected to be ready in 2022.</p>
    <p>Mr Zaqy said: “We have a pretty good space, but at the same time we also con­tinue with our safety mea­sures as well to en­sure that we have not just the ca­pac­ity, but have enough safe dis­tanc­ing too.”</p>
    <p>The news was wel­comed by Safra mem­ber Muhammed Sabri Mah­mod. The 41-year-old teacher, who has four chil­dren aged be­tween 18 months and 17 years, said he will be reg­is­ter­ing his daugh­ters – aged 15 and 17 – as de­pen­dants.</p>
    <p>“They don’t have to get their par­ents to bring them here, so they can be more in­de­pen­dent... It’s good they have this op­por­tu­nity,” said Mr Muhammed Sabri.</p>
    <p>Mem­bers can reg­is­ter un­der the new scheme on­line at the HomeTeamNS or Safra web­sites, or at cus­tomer ser­vice coun­ters at the var­i­ous club­houses.</p>
    <p>Es­pe­cially dur­ing this pan­demic, where many are prob­a­bly look­ing for places to spend fam­ily time to­gether... our NS­men can use this op­por­tu­nity to ex­plore some of the fa­cil­i­ties that we have across our Safra club­houses.</p>
