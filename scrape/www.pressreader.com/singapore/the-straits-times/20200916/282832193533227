    <p>LOS AN­GE­LES • Back in Fe­bru­ary, two Chi­nese film­mak­ers strapped on hazmat suits and em­bed­ded them­selves in Wuhan’s over­run hos­pi­tals.</p>
    <p>There, they cap­tured har­row­ing footage of ter­ri­fied cit­i­zens ham­mer­ing on hos­pi­tal doors, medics col­laps­ing from ex­haus­tion and rel­a­tives beg­ging in vain to say good­bye to coro­n­avirus-in­fected loved ones.</p>
    <p>Now, those i mages have been edited and put to­gether by New York-based di­rec­tor Wu Hao (Peo­ple’s Repub­lic Of De­sire, 2018).</p>
    <p>Pre­mier­ing at the Toronto film fes­ti­val on Mon­day, 76 Days – named for the du­ra­tion of the cen­tral Chi­nese city’s dra­co­nian lock­down – is the first ma­jor doc­u­men­tary from the dis­ease’s orig­i­nal epi­cen­tre to hit the­atres.</p>
    <p>Wu first con­tacted the two film-mak­ers, one of whom is anony­mous for his own safety, after wit­ness­ing China’s early lock­down first-hand dur­ing a fam­ily visit for Chi­nese New Year.</p>
    <p>The footage they sent him re­vealed how, in the chaos of the dis­ease’s early weeks, they were able to get re­mark­able ac­cess – but at con­sid­er­able per­sonal risk and suf­fer­ing.</p>
    <p>“It was a hor­ri­ble, hor­ri­ble shoot­ing ex­pe­ri­ence for them,” Wu said. “They were faint­ing, it was re­ally warm. A few times (film-maker Chen Weixi) wanted to throw up, but he couldn’t be­cause once you throw up, once you re­move your PPE, you have to get out, you could not come back again.”</p>
    <p>“It was like shoot­ing in a war zone,” he added.</p>
    <p>Wu also had a per­sonal mo­ti­va­tion for pur­su­ing the project.</p>
    <p>His grand­fa­ther died of can­cer soon after the out­break, un­able to find a hos­pi­tal bed as re­sources strained un­der the weight of Covid-19.</p>
    <p>“In the be­gin­ning, I was an­gry with the Chi­nese gov­ern­ment – I re­ally wanted to find out who’s at fault, what caused this,” said Wu.</p>
    <p>But once the pan­demic spread to other coun­tries like the United States, the de­sire to place blame was re­placed by a de­sire to doc­u­ment how “as hu­man be­ings live through this, how we can share this ex­pe­ri­ence”.</p>
    <p>It re­mains un­clear whether the movie will ever be shown in China, where news about the pan­demic has been tightly con­trolled since day one.</p>
