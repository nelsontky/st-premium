    <p>•</p>
    <p>WARSAW Poland’s gov­ern­ment is stalling the im­ple­men­ta­tion of a High Court rul­ing that ef­fec­tively bans abor­tion amid some of the big­gest street protests since the fall of com­mu­nism.</p>
    <p>Though the po­lit­i­cal cli­mate is tense, this ap­pears to be a tac­ti­cal slow­down aimed at avoid­ing a new flare-up in demon­stra­tions at a time the gov­ern­ment is con­sid­er­ing more lock­down mea­sures.</p>
    <p>Ver­dicts be­come bind­ing after they are printed in a gov­ern­ment gazette and the Cab­i­net had un­til Mon­day this week to pub­lish a rul­ing that fur­ther tight­ens one of Europe’s strictest laws on end­ing preg­nan­cies.</p>
    <p>“There’s dis­cus­sion about the Pres­i­dent’s pro­posal and it’s good to give your­self some time for di­a­logue and to work out a new po­si­tion,” Mr Michal Dwor­czyk, head of the Prime Min­is­ter’s Chan­cellery, told broad­caster TVN24 on Tues­day.</p>
    <p>The stand-off with the wom­en­led pro­test­ers has be­come a crit­i­cal mo­ment for the rul­ing Law and Jus­tice party that has been tak­ing con­trol over all facets of so­ci­ety in the name of or­di­nary Poles and Catholic tra­di­tions.</p>
    <p>The party has also man­aged to la­bel the gay com­mu­nity and in­creas­ingly the coun­try’s part­ners in the Euro­pean Union as ene­mies.</p>
    <p>While the gov­ern­ment has asked peo­ple to stay in­doors and banned mass gath­er­ings to slow the spread of the coro­n­avirus, that has not stopped pro-choice women from tak­ing to the streets.</p>
    <p>Law and Jus­tice party has lost about a quar­ter of its sup­port­ers as the tus­sle over civil lib­er­ties drags on.</p>
    <p>The Cab­i­net has in the past delayed pub­li­ca­tions of rul­ings it dis­agreed with, but this time the move ap­pears aimed at avoid­ing an es­ca­la­tion that could stoke even big­ger demon­stra­tions.</p>
    <p>Last Fri­day, at least 100,000 peo­ple marched through Warsaw and more than half a mil­lion protested across the coun­try.</p>
    <p>“This de­lay looks like they’re play­ing for time and wait­ing for the pro­test­ers to tire,” said po­lit­i­cal sci­en­tist Olgierd Annusewicz of Warsaw Univer­sity.</p>
    <p>“It looks like grass­roots protests aren’t fad­ing for now.”</p>
    <p>Pres­i­dent An­drzej Duda has pro­posed leg­is­la­tion to soften the im­pact of the court’s ver­dict in the hopes of find­ing a po­lit­i­cal so­lu­tion.</p>
    <p>But his draft law was re­jected by a num­ber of rul­ing party back­benchers, most of the op­po­si­tion as well as the pro­test­ers, many of whom want a re­turn of the nearly three-decade-long sta­tus quo on abor­tion.</p>
    <p>The rul­ing party on Tues­day delayed the next par­lia­men­tary sit­ting, dur­ing which the Bill may be de­bated, to the mid­dle of this month.</p>
    <p>PROTESTS GO­ING STRONG</p>
    <p>This de­lay looks like they’re play­ing for time and wait­ing for the pro­test­ers to tire... It looks like grass­roots protests aren’t fad­ing for now.</p>
