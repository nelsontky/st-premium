    <p>Two days af­ter Ms Ravin­der Kaur, 35, had a mis­car­riage in 2018, her grand­mother died.</p>
    <p>That com­pounded her grief, re­calls the pre-school teacher, who had been six weeks preg­nant with her sec­ond child. “I didn’t know what I was cry­ing for,” she re­calls.</p>
    <p>Close fam­ily mem­bers were told about the mis­car­riage as she did not take part in some fu­neral rites. But a dis­tant rel­a­tive quizzed her at the fu­neral: “You should have a sec­ond child. Why do you want to wait?”</p>
    <p>Ms Kaur wit­nessed first-hand con­tra­dic­tory at­ti­tudes to­wards preg­nancy and loss. On the one hand, there is un­wel­come in­ter­est in the num­ber of chil­dren (or none) a mar­ried cou­ple has; on the other, there is a re­sound­ing si­lence sur­round­ing preg­nancy loss.</p>
    <p>Even af­ter her grand­mother’s fu­neral, no­body spoke to her about her mis­car­riage.</p>
    <p>“I felt that I had failed to pro­tect my child. If some­body had said some­thing use­ful to me, it would have hurt a lit­tle less. With no­body to talk to, I kept it to my­self,” she says. Her hus­band, 37, works in the lo­gis­tics sec­tor and they now have two daugh­ters, aged 10 months old and five.</p>
    <p>Griev­ing openly about preg­nancy loss has tra­di­tion­ally been taboo across cul­tures.</p>
    <p>In Septem­ber, when model Chrissy Teigen lost her third child 20 weeks into a trou­bled preg­nancy, she shared pho­to­graphs on so­cial me­dia of her­self and her singer hus­band, John Leg­end, griev­ing in hos­pi­tal.</p>
    <p>Re­ac­tions were po­larised. Some crit­i­cised the Amer­i­can celebri­ties for mak­ing a pub­lic spec­ta­cle of some­thing pri­vate. Oth­ers praised them for break­ing the taboo by mourn­ing a loss that is of­ten kept from view.</p>
    <p>Ear­lier this week, Teigen penned an es­say on Medium, an on­line pub­lish­ing plat­form, where she slammed claims that she was over­shar­ing. She wrote that the pho­tos “aren’t for any­one but the peo­ple who have lived this or are cu­ri­ous enough to won­der what some­thing like this is like. Th­ese pho­tos are only for the peo­ple who need them”.</p>
    <p>In Sin­ga­pore, more young moth­ers feel a sim­i­lar de­sire to ex­press the pain of such loss, as well as ac­knowl­edge the ex­is­tence, how­ever brief, of chil­dren who died in utero.</p>
    <p>More mil­len­nial women, broadly aged be­tween 24 and 39, are demon­strat­ing in­creas­ing open­ness about preg­nancy loss, ob­servers say, in part be­cause of an aware­ness of how com­mu­nal sup­port can help in pro­cess­ing grief.</p>
    <p>Ms Kaur thinks Teigen’s pho­tos help women like her.</p>
    <p>“At least we know we are not alone. If we keep hid­ing our­selves, it will never be talked about,” she says. “I didn’t know any­one who had a mis­car­riage, but my doc­tor said it was more com­mon than you might think.”</p>
    <p>About 20 per cent of women suf­fer from a mis­car­riage early in their preg­nancy, usu­ally up to 12 weeks’ ges­ta­tion. Still­births, which re­fer to the death of a baby af­ter 24 weeks of preg­nancy, are rarer.</p>
    <p>For the ma­jor­ity of women, the causes of preg­nancy loss – which can in­clude chro­mo­so­mal or ge­netic de­fects in the foe­tus – can­not be es­tab­lished.</p>
    <p>Ms Sil­via Wetherell, clin­i­cal di­rec­tor at More Mind­ful, a clinic that spe­cialises in peri­na­tal men­tal health, points to a “def­i­nite gen­er­a­tional gap” in deal­ing with such loss.</p>
    <p>“I see mil­len­ni­als seek­ing sup­port on­line that is at odds with what they’re hear­ing from their par­ents and grand­par­ents,” she says. In some cases, older peo­ple may ask them to “move on” be­fore they are ready.</p>
    <p>Young women of­ten chafe at such ad­vice from their el­ders, even if of­fered with good in­ten­tions, as they are al­ready wrestling with guilt and self-doubt, even in cases where the cause of their loss is un­known, she says.</p>
    <p>As such, Ms Feli­cia Tan, di­rec­tor of An­gel Hearts, a non-profit or­gan­i­sa­tion that sup­ports be­reaved par­ents who have ex­pe­ri­enced preg­nancy loss, notes that the stigma against speak­ing openly about preg­nancy loss re­mains strong.</p>
    <p>She says: “More peo­ple, es­pe­cially mil­len­ni­als who are more ex­pres­sive, are speak­ing up, but typ­i­cally in con­fi­den­tial chan­nels. They want to know that they are in a safe en­vi­ron­ment like a sup­port group.”</p>
    <p>An­gel Hearts’ ser­vices in­clude re­pur­pos­ing wed­ding gowns for gar­ments, called “an­gel gowns”, to clothe in­fants who died dur­ing preg­nancy or shortly af­ter birth.</p>
    <p>It seems that every­one – both the af­flicted and those seek­ing to con­sole – strug­gles to make sense of mis­car­riage.</p>
    <p>Since she got mar­ried in March this year, Ms Siti Nur Syafiqah Is­mail, 24, has suf­fered two mis­car­riages. She had to take a month off work to re­cover from bouts of weep­ing and ever-cir­cling ques­tions in their wake.</p>
    <p>“What did I do wrong? What went wrong? But I didn’t do any­thing wrong. I hadn’t done any heavy lift­ing, noth­ing like that,” re­calls the man­ager of a re­tail store. Her hus­band, who is 27, works in se­cu­rity ser­vices.</p>
    <p>She did not want to feel that her preg­nan­cies never hap­pened. A fear lin­gered that “only you know, that you’re the only one that’s seen the ul­tra­sound scans”, she re­calls.</p>
    <p>But the com­plex­i­ties of her ex­pe­ri­ence were hard to com­mu­ni­cate. She did not want to dis­re­spect older rel­a­tives who did not want her to talk about “it”, but she soon re­alised that her peers also avoided the topic for fear of ag­gra­vat­ing her sad­ness.</p>
    <p>Her col­leagues were re­spect­ful and ret­i­cent about her loss, though she longed to talk about it be­yond the ini­tial con­do­lences.</p>
    <p>A rel­a­tive, who had just con­ceived, avoided talk­ing about her preg­nancy, for fear of re­mind­ing Ms Syafiqah of her mis­car­riages, even though Ms Syafiqah wanted to be part of such con­fi­dences.</p>
    <p>Once, she found her­self talk­ing to a stranger, a Grab driver, about how she had two chil­dren but had lost them.</p>
    <p>“Peo­ple don’t know how to re­act,” says Ms Syafiqah, who even­tu­ally joined a sup­port group on­line.</p>
    <p>In­dus­try ob­servers say that baby steps have nonethe­less been made in broach­ing, mourn­ing and re­cov­er­ing from preg­nancy loss.</p>
    <p>Ms Va­lerie Lim, co-founder of Child Be­reave­ment Sup­port (Sin­ga­pore), says: “Th­ese days, par­ents tend to reach out to us very early in their grief – as early as one week af­ter their loss. This was not the case when we started back in 2005.</p>
    <p>“What this says is that cou­ples recog­nise the need for sup­port and they are will­ing to share their ex­pe­ri­ence with oth­ers who have been on the same path.”</p>
    <p>Hus­bands, too, are en­ter­ing the con­ver­sa­tion.</p>
    <p>At KK Women’s and Chil­dren’s Hos­pi­tal, Ms Mavis Teo, who is head and mas­ter med­i­cal so­cial worker at its Med­i­cal So­cial Work Depart­ment, says: “Our team of med­i­cal so­cial work­ers have made a pos­i­tive ob­ser­va­tion that hus­bands are be­com­ing more forth­com­ing and ex­pres­sive in their feel­ings, com­pared to a few years ago.</p>
    <p>“They are also more open to hav­ing their wives par­tic­i­pate in coun­selling and even be­ing in­volved in the coun­selling them­selves.”</p>
    <p>Ms Deb­o­rah Su, whose son Ishak died at 21 weeks’ ges­ta­tion in Septem­ber last year, has had treat­ment for de­pres­sion since her mis­car­riage, which oc­curred when she was al­ready ill with a breast ab­scess. She has pho­tos of her still­born son and a mem­ory box con­tain­ing his clothes.</p>
    <p>There is value in talk­ing about a grief that is not widely ac­knowl­edged in so­ci­ety, she main­tains.</p>
    <p>“I like talk­ing about Ishak, but a lot of peo­ple are not okay with it. Peo­ple just don’t know how to deal with death,” says the mar­ket­ing man­ager, who is mar­ried to a 35-yearold Sin­ga­pore Civil De­fence Force of­fi­cer. The cou­ple have two other sons, aged eight and five.</p>
    <p>“No­body re­ally has it to­gether and the whole per­fec­tion ideal about moth­er­hood is so not true,” she says.</p>
    <p>“I’ve be­come more hon­est about my strug­gles and about own­ing who I am and what hap­pened. And that has given me some peace.”</p>
