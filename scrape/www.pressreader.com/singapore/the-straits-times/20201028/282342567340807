    <p>•</p>
    <p>A ques­tion mark re­mains over whether Cris­tiano Ron­aldo will take his place in Ju­ven­tus’ team to face Lionel Messi’s Barcelona to­day as he is await­ing his swab test re­sult, Juve coach An­drea Pirlo con­firmed yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>When the Cham­pi­ons League draw was made ear­lier this month, the Group G tie be­tween the Ital­ian cham­pi­ons and the Span­ish gi­ants looked to be the glam­our match-up of the group phase.</p>
    <p>Be­fore leav­ing for Turin’s Al­lianz Sta­dium in 2018, Ron­aldo, as the tal­is­man for Real Madrid, spent nine sea­sons bat­tling for foot­ball’s high­est honours against the Ar­gen­tinian at Barca.</p>
    <p>Messi, 33, has fea­tured in four vic­to­ri­ous cam­paigns for the Cata­lans, while Ron­aldo, 35, has won the Cham­pi­ons League five times, four with Real and once with Manch­ester United.</p>
    <p>The pair have met five times in Cham­pi­ons League games, most re­cently in the semi-fi­nals in 2011, and have never played against each other this early in the com­pe­ti­tion.</p>
    <p>The stage ap­peared set for their first meet­ing since Ron­aldo’s de­par­ture from Spain.</p>
    <p>How­ever, the Por­tu­gal skip­per tested pos­i­tive for Covid-19 two weeks ago on in­ter­na­tional duty, and has been in self-iso­la­tion since re­turn­ing to Italy.</p>
    <p>He missed Sun­day’s Serie A draw with Verona af­ter a test showed he was still in­fected, but if his lat­est swab test – the re­sult was not known by press time – clears him of the virus, he could play his first game for Juve in a month.</p>
    <p>“Ron­aldo had a test like ev­ery­one else, this evening (yes­ter­day) we will have the de­fin­i­tive re­sult,” Pirlo told re­porters in Turin.</p>
    <p>“For now, it’s all on the high seas, when the fi­nal re­sult comes, ev­ery­thing will be clearer.</p>
    <p>“For 15 years, Messi and Ron­aldo have done great things.</p>
    <p>“For the first time, I’ll be tak­ing on Messi as a coach, I’ll treat him with the enor­mous re­spect that he de­serves.”</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to Uefa rules, Ron­aldo will need to test neg­a­tive 24 hours be­fore the game if he is to fea­ture.</p>
    <p>“To­mor­row (Wed­nes­day) morn­ing we will count the num­ber of play­ers avail­able,” added Pirlo.</p>
    <p>“De­pend­ing on the re­sult, we’ll see what we do. It’s not easy to play an en­tire game af­ter 15 days of in­ac­tiv­ity.”</p>
    <p>Ron­aldo, who is asymp­to­matic, has missed three games in­clud­ing his side’s 2-0 Cham­pi­ons League win at Dy­namo Kiev last week, and Pirlo is hope­ful his star can play.</p>
    <p>Team­mate and Brazil de­fender Danilo agreed, say­ing: “It’s clear that any team would miss a player like Cris­tiano. But we have faith in ev­ery player on the team. We have peo­ple who want to do well and help us have a great match.”</p>
    <p>With Juve stum­bling in at­tack re­cently af­ter two con­sec­u­tive league draws, Pirlo’s men ap­pear to miss Ron­aldo’s cut­ting edge, par­tic­u­larly as the team have press­ing con­cerns in de­fence.</p>
    <p>Cap­tain Gior­gio Chiellini and Matthijs de Ligt have been ruled out with in­juries, while Leonardo Bonucci’s thigh strain will be eval­u­ated to­day. For­ward Paulo Dy­bala re­mains short of match fit­ness.</p>
    <p>For­mer Italy and Juve mid­fielder</p>
    <p>Pirlo, whose team last won the Euro­pean Cup in 1996, said: “Th­ese are the matches that ev­ery­one would like to play.</p>
    <p>“We have this op­por­tu­nity and we can’t wait to test our­selves against Barcelona.</p>
    <p>“It’s not a de­ci­sive game, but we still want to see what our value is.”</p>
