    <p>TAN­JUNG PI­NANG • Riau Is­lands gov­er­nor Is­dianto has tested pos­i­tive for Covid-19, four days af­ter he was sworn into of­fice by Pres­i­dent Joko Wi­dodo.</p>
    <p>Riau Is­lands Covid-19 task force spokesman Tjet­jep Yu­di­ana said the gov­er­nor had taken a poly­merase chain re­ac­tion (PCR) test af­ter learn­ing that his per­sonal body­guard, an army of­fi­cer iden­ti­fied as DPS, had con­tracted the virus.</p>
    <p>The gov­er­nor took the test in the Health Min­istry’s Batam En­vi­ron­men­tal Health and Dis­ease Con­trol Cen­tre last Fri­day. “Af­ter the body­guard was de­clared pos­i­tive for Covid-19, the gov­er­nor en­tered self-quar­an­tine and im­me­di­ately took the test. His con­di­tion is cur­rently stable,” Mr Tjet­jep told</p>
    <p>The Jakarta Post on Satur­day.</p>
    <p>He added that the gov­er­nor was un­der­go­ing self-quar­an­tine in the pro­vin­cial ad­min­is­tra­tion of­fice com­plex in Tan­jung Pi­nang, ac­com­pa­nied by sev­eral med­i­cal ex­perts.</p>
    <p>Mr Is­dianto tested neg­a­tive for the virus in a PCR swab two days prior to his inau­gu­ra­tion in Jakarta.</p>
    <p>DPS had ac­com­pa­nied Mr Is­dianto on his trip to Jakarta but be­cause of health pro­to­cols, he was not al­lowed to en­ter the State Palace for the cer­e­mony. DPS de­vel­oped high fever upon his re­turn from Jakarta and was ad­mit­ted to a hos­pi­tal in the pro­vin­cial cap­i­tal of Tan­jung Pi­nang, where he was di­ag­nosed with Covid-19.</p>
    <p>Mr Is­dianto, who pre­vi­ously served as deputy gov­er­nor, as­sumed the top po­si­tion af­ter his pre­de­ces­sor, Nur­din Basirun, was con­victed of ac­cept­ing a bribe. Ac­cord­ing to the gov­ern­ment’s of­fi­cial count, the prov­ince had recorded 491 con­firmed Covid-19 cases as of Satur­day, with 18 deaths and 321 re­cov­er­ies.</p>
    <p>Na­tion­wide, the health au­thor­i­ties have recorded more than 100,000 cases and over 5,100 deaths.</p>
