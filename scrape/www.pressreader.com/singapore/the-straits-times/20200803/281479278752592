    <p>For the first time, Sin­ga­pore­ans will be able to see from their homes the state flag fly-past dur­ing this year’s Na­tional Day Pa­rade (NDP).</p>
    <p>Two Chi­nook heli­copters, each car­ry­ing the Sin­ga­pore flag at about 305m in the air, will fly across the is­land on two sep­a­rate routes in the east and the west.</p>
    <p>Each he­li­copter will be es­corted by two Apache heli­copters dur­ing this seg­ment ti­tled “Fly Our Flag”.</p>
    <p>The east route will take the flag – mea­sur­ing 30m by 20m – past hous­ing es­tates such as Be­dok and Pung­gol, while the heli­copters on the west route will fly past res­i­dences in places such as Jurong East, Choa Chu Kang and Ang Mo Kio.</p>
    <p>Both routes will be­gin in the south of Sin­ga­pore and end at Sem­bawang Air Base in the north. The flights are slated to start at 10.30am and will each take 55 minutes.</p>
    <p>In pre­vi­ous years, the fly-past took place at a sin­gle l oca­tion where the NDP was held, such as the float­ing plat­form at Ma­rina Bay, and lasted only 10 minutes.</p>
    <p>With the fo­cus on cel­e­brat­ing the nation’s 55th birth­day at home, this year’s NDP will be split into morn­ing and evening por­tions, with many seg­ments tak­ing place in dif­fer­ent lo­ca­tions across the is­land.</p>
    <p>The morn­ing por­tion of the Aug 9 cel­e­bra­tions will in­clude a na­tion­wide broad­cast of the Prime Min­is­ter’s Na­tional Day Mes­sage and a pa­rade at the Padang.</p>
    <p>The evening show will take place at The Star Per­form­ing Arts Cen­tre in Buona Vista. It will fea­ture films and per­for­mances and cul­mi­nate in a co­or­di­nated fire­works dis­play at dif­fer­ent sites across the coun­try.</p>
    <p>All the ac­tion will be shown live on TV and streamed on In­ter­net plat­forms.</p>
    <p>Cap­tain Eu­gene Chua, who is in­volved in the plan­ning and co­or­di­na­tion of the fly-past routes, said the routes and the flight height of the heli­copters were de­signed for max­i­mum ex­po­sure of the flag to res­i­dents in the heart­land ar­eas.</p>
    <p>“Through­out the var­i­ous re­hearsals that we had, we have ac­tu­ally sent spot­ters out to dif­fer­ent HDB (Hous­ing Board) blocks and open ar­eas,” added the 32-year-old Apache he­li­copter pi­lot.</p>
    <p>Capt Chua, who is the deputy fly­ing dis­play mar­shal, also said the safety of the res­i­dents on the ground as well as the he­li­copter crew was a pri­or­ity when plan­ning the routes.</p>
    <p>Mil­i­tary Ex­pert 2 Sukhdesh Singh, who will be on the Chi­nook he­li­copter tak­ing the east route, said he will be en­sur­ing the three heli­copters on his route re­main in close for­ma­tion but at a proper dis­tance from one an­other.</p>
    <p>“I will also be look­ing out for any un­manned fly­ing air­craft such as drones, and birds that might come into the flight path,” said the 35-year-old flight en­gi­neer.</p>
    <p>He will also be watch­ing out for any flight ob­sta­cles such as con­struc­tion cranes and high-rise build­ings that the heli­copters will have to avoid, he added.</p>
    <p>There are con­tin­gency plans in place in the event of any com­pli­ca­tions, such as un­favourable weather con­di­tions or if the flags fail to un­furl fully.</p>
    <p>Th­ese in­clude 14 back-up flags at mul­ti­ple air­bases across Sin­ga­pore, such as Changi Air Base.</p>
    <p>In the light of t he on­go­ing Covid-19 sit­u­a­tion, the team pre­par­ing and rig­ging the flags will be split into two sec­tions, with each sta­tioned at a dif­fer­ent lo­ca­tion.</p>
    <p>First Sergeant Daniel Ho, 31, who is part of the team, said this would not af­fect the time taken for each flag to be pre­pared. It takes 45 minutes to two hours for 25 men to pre­pare a flag.</p>
    <p>How­ever, the re­duced man­power from split­ting the team would make car­ry­ing the flags out more tax­ing, said the op­er­a­tionally ready na­tional ser­vice­man.</p>
    <p>This year’s NDP will also mark the first time a fe­male pi­lot will be fly­ing a Chi­nook he­li­copter in the state flag fly-past.</p>
    <p>Cap­tain Trixie Tang, 31, who is also the Repub­lic of Sin­ga­pore Air Force’s first fe­male Chi­nook he­li­copter pi­lot, will be fly­ing on the east route.</p>
    <p>“I feel very hon­oured and grate­ful to be given this op­por­tu­nity,” she said.</p>
