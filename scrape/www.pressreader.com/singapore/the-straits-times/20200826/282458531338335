    <p>The Asus ROG Ze­phyrus G14 is ar­guably the most unique-look­ing gam­ing lap­top at the mo­ment.</p>
    <p>Half of this 14-inch lap­top’s lid is cov­ered with 6,536 tiny per­fo­ra­tions that let the light from in­ter­nal mini LEDs pass through.</p>
    <p>This fea­ture, dubbed the AniMe Ma­trix dis­play, lets users create their own cus­tom dot-ma­trix im­ages and an­i­ma­tions on the lid, us­ing the in­cluded Asus Ar­moury Crate app.</p>
    <p>It is the first time I have seen a dot-ma­trix LED dis­play on a note­book lid. While the idea is not new, such dis­plays are of­ten found on mod­i­fied desk­top com­puter cas­ings cre­ated by PC en­thu­si­asts.</p>
    <p>The Ar­moury Crate app comes with sev­eral pre­made an­i­ma­tions for the AniMe Ma­trix dis­play. You can make one from scratch by up­load­ing your own im­ages. Tip: use Adobe Pho­to­shop’s halftone fil­ter to con­vert nor­mal pho­tos to a dot­ma­trix ver­sion.</p>
    <p>Users can also choose to have the AniMe Ma­trix dis­play show sta­tus no­ti­fi­ca­tions, such as the time or bat­tery in­di­ca­tor. My favourite use case is to have the dis­play act as a vi­su­aliser for the lap­top’s au­dio.</p>
    <p>The G14 is por­ta­ble for a gam­ing lap­top, with a com­pact 14-inch mag­ne­sium alu­minium chas­sis weigh­ing around 1.7kg. More im­por­tantly, the palm rest and lid are stiff and rigid, giv­ing the lap­top a re­as­sur­ingly solid heft. The key­board has prac­ti­cally zero flex and of­fers good key travel.</p>
    <p>Some gamers may be dis­ap­pointed that the key­board back­light comes only in white and not the usual cus­tomis­able RGB colours. But it does fit the mono­tone vibe of the G14’s dot-ma­trix dis­play.</p>
    <p>Given the G14’s ul­tra­book-like form fac­tor, Asus has reused fea­tures from its ZenBook ul­tra­books, such as the Er­goLift hinge.</p>
    <p>This hinge raises the note­book’s base slightly off the desk and tilts the key­board at a more com­fort­able typ­ing an­gle when the lid is opened. This de­sign is said to help with air flow, as it gives the bot­tom vents more breath­ing room. But the base still gets un­com­fort­ably warm when run­ning a game.</p>
    <p>The G14 also has a fin­ger­print sen­sor in­te­grated into its power but­ton, which lets users sign into their Win­dows ac­counts by us­ing a regis­tered fin­ger­print to turn on the lap­top.</p>
    <p>But if Asus in­tends for the G14 to be a lap­top for both work and play, it is held back by the glar­ing omis­sion of the Web cam­era. Per­haps it is the</p>
    <p>AniMe Ma­trix dis­play or the thin top bezel, but what­ever the rea­son, the lack of the Web cam­era is a big miss, given the cur­rent wide­spread use of video-con­fer­enc­ing soft­ware.</p>
    <p>Of course, users can al­ways get an ex­ter­nal USB Web cam­era, but it would use up a valu­able USB port (the G14 has just two USB Type-A ports).</p>
    <p>On the bright side, the G14 has two USB Type-C ports that can be used to charge the lap­top’s bat­tery. But you have to use the lap­top’s bun­dled power adapter (with a bar­rel-shaped con­nec­tor) when us­ing the ded­i­cated Nvidia Ge­Force GTX 1650 Ti graph­ics chip, as this power brick de­liv­ers more power than USB-C.</p>
    <p>This Nvidia graph­ics chip is a lower mid-tier model that can run most games at less in­ten­sive graph­ics set­tings.</p>
    <p>It is aided by an eight-core AMD Ryzen 7 4800HS pro­ces­sor that com­pares well with In­tel’s lat­est Core i7-10875H chip, es­pe­cially in multi-threaded work­loads.</p>
    <p>In Cr­y­sis 3 at 1,920 x 1,080 pix­els, the G14 man­aged an av­er­age frame rate of 65 frames per sec­ond (fps) – slightly lower than the 68fps of the Acer Nitro 5, which has a slower Core i5 pro­ces­sor, but a more pow­er­ful Nvidia Ge­Force RTX 2060 graph­ics chip.</p>
    <p>Per­son­ally, I did not feel the gam­ing per­for­mance was lack­ing while us­ing the G14. But its 14-inch screen still feels small – ob­jects and text are more dif­fi­cult to dis­cern with my age­ing eyes.</p>
    <p>Its bat­tery life is ex­cel­lent for a gam­ing note­book. In The Straits Times’ video-loop bat­tery test, the G14 lasted six hours, just an hour shy of most ul­tra­books.</p>
    <p>At $2,498, the G14 is more ex­pen­sive than some com­peti­tors, though I find the pre­mium rea­son­able, given its unique dot-ma­trix dis­play.</p>
    <p>For those who want a more ca­pa­ble graph­ics chip, the G14 is also avail­able at $2,798 with a Ge­Force RTX 2060 graph­ics chip.</p>
