    <p>Some skills eas­ily cut across sec­tors, so it is not far-fetched to see a shop as­sis­tant switch­ing to health­care or an air trans­port worker find­ing him­self in a lo­gis­tics fac­tory help­ing with sup­ply chain op­er­a­tions.</p>
    <p>Such switches may seem im­prob­a­ble at first glance, but there are base­line skills that the two sec­tors in each ex­am­ple share – peo­ple man­age­ment in re­tail and health­care; or be­ing able to han­dle goods in avi­a­tion and lo­gis­tics.</p>
    <p>Fo­cus­ing on skills in­stead of just prior job ex­pe­ri­ence can help job seek­ers move from in­dus­tries that have been hit hard by the pan­demic to those of­fer­ing long-term op­por­tu­ni­ties, noted a re­port from pro­fes­sional ser­vices firm EY.</p>
    <p>The sec­tors at risk from the pan­demic in­clude ac­com­mo­da­tion and food ser­vices, recre­ational ser­vices, air trans­port and con­struc­tion, it added.</p>
    <p>On the other side of the coin, op­por­tu­ni­ties are flour­ish­ing in bio­phar­ma­ceu­ti­cal man­u­fac­tur­ing, elec­tron­ics, fi­nan­cial ser­vices, food man­u­fac­tur­ing, health­care, in­fo­com­mu­ni­ca­tions tech­nol­ogy, lo­gis­tics, me­dia and so­cial ser­vice.</p>
    <p>The con­trast­ing for­tunes of dif­fer­ent sec­tors are not ex­pected to be just for the short term, but look set to last way into a new nor­mal that will change the way con­sumers be­have, said EY Asean work­force ad­vi­sory leader Samir Bedi.</p>
    <p>“First, these sec­tors at risk have been the most di­rectly af­fected by Covid-19 through safe dis­tanc­ing mea­sures, bor­der clo­sures and travel re­stric­tions in Sin­ga­pore and across the world.</p>
    <p>“But be­yond the im­me­di­ate ef­fects of the pan­demic, there is also a fair amount of change around the way con­sumers are go­ing to be­have af­ter Covid-19.”</p>
    <p>TAK­ING A SKILLS-BASED AP­PROACH</p>
    <p>Mr Bedi also said that pre-pan­demic, peo­ple were al­ready mov­ing across sec­tors, but it was usu­ally be­cause they wanted to ex­plore a new do­main or learn some­thing new.</p>
    <p>“We see that this has started in a more ac­cel­er­ated man­ner now. But we do think sec­tors with op­por­tu­ni­ties can also help in terms of job cre­ation, with ad­di­tional jobs that en­hance pro­duc­tiv­ity and peo­ple (em­ploy­ers) that look for more skill sets across sec­tors,” he said.</p>
    <p>A Rand­stad survey con­ducted in June and July found that 25 per cent of re­spon­dents who were ac­tively look­ing for a new job said they wanted to change their ca­reers or the in­dus­try they were in.</p>
    <p>The chal­lenge to­day is to also get peo­ple to move from the sec­tors that have low hir­ing, or even un­em­ploy­ment, to growth in­dus­tries, Mr Bedi said.</p>
    <p>“To be able to do this, we ad­vo­cate a skills-based ap­proach,” he added. “Rather than stat­ing what you did pre­vi­ously in your cur­ricu­lum vi­tae, it is bet­ter to speak in terms of skills and how they can be ap­plied to a new sec­tor in sim­i­lar ways. That al­lows for more mo­bil­ity across sec­tors.”</p>
    <p>For in­stance, work­ers can move from the ac­com­mo­da­tion and food ser­vice sec­tor to food man­u­fac­tur­ing in­stead if they have core skills in food han­dling, qual­ity as­sur­ance and con­trol.</p>
    <p>Mr Bedi ac­knowl­edged that there are still cer­tain roles that need li­cences and have other manda­tory re­quire­ments, so hav­ing trans­fer­able skills does not guar­an­tee an au­to­matic job move.</p>
    <p>The em­ployee will still have to go for train­ing and learn to ap­ply their skills to a new sec­tor.</p>
    <p>“Busi­nesses need to con­tin­u­ally in­vest in learn­ing and scal­ing up the em­ploy­ees. Those are the schools of to­mor­row to drive life­long learn­ing,” Mr Bedi said.</p>
    <p>He added that from an em­ployer’s per­spec­tive, bring­ing in some­one from a dif­fer­ent in­dus­try might also be ben­e­fi­cial. “It means new blood, and per­haps the em­ployee can look at cur­rent prob­lems in a new way. It al­lows for a bet­ter and more in­no­va­tive or­gan­i­sa­tion.”</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore has done a good job through the Skill­sFu­ture pro­grammes, he said, but it could go fur­ther by help­ing each in­di­vid­ual mea­sure his ex­ist­ing skills and see which ones he lacks and how em­ploy­able he is based on this skill set.</p>
    <p>Rand­stad’s man­ag­ing di­rec­tor for Malaysia and Sin­ga­pore, Ms Jaya Dass, said that some­times, in ven­tur­ing into new op­por­tu­ni­ties, peo­ple have to be open to ac­cept­ing lower positions and salaries due to the lack of ac­cu­mu­lated ex­pe­ri­ence in an area of spe­cial­ity.</p>
    <p>But life­long learn­ing re­mains vi­tal, she noted, for both job seek­ers and com­pa­nies that seek to at­tract new hires.</p>
    <p>“When se­lect­ing or­gan­i­sa­tions to work for, job seek­ers would also look to j oin com­pa­nies that are proac­tively up­skilling their em­ploy­ees.</p>
    <p>“These l earn­ing and devel­op­ment ef­forts in­di­cate that the com­pany is will­ing to in­vest in the longterm devel­op­ment of their staff to en­sure that they stay rel­e­vant and com­pet­i­tive.”</p>
    <p>To be able to do this, we ad­vo­cate a skills-based ap­proach. Rather than stat­ing what you did pre­vi­ously in your cur­ricu­lum vi­tae, it is bet­ter to speak in terms of skills and how they can be ap­plied to a new sec­tor in sim­i­lar ways. That al­lows for more mo­bil­ity across sec­tors.</p>
    <p>MR SAMIR BEDI, EY Asean work­force ad­vi­sory leader, on get­ting peo­ple to move from the sec­tors that have low hir­ing, or even un­em­ploy­ment, to growth in­dus­tries.</p>
