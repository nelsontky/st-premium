    <p>Noth­ing will stop The Rock from go­ing to work. Not even a front gate that re­fuses to open.</p>
    <p>Last Fri­day, Hol­ly­wood ac­tor Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson posted on so­cial me­dia a photo of his dam­aged gate with the ac­com­pa­ny­ing cap­tion: “Not my finest hour, but a man’s gotta go to work.”</p>
    <p>The WWE wrestler-turned-ac­tor said that his front gate had failed to open due to a power out­age caused by se­vere storms.</p>
    <p>“I tried to over­ride the hy­draulic sys­tem to open the gates, which usu­ally works when power goes out – but this time, it wouldn’t,” said the 48-year-old ac­tion star.</p>
    <p>“Made some calls to see how fast I can get the gate tech on site, but I didn’t have 45 min to wait.”</p>
    <p>He was rush­ing to the set of up­com­ing ac­tion thriller Red No­tice, which has re­sumed film­ing af­ter he re­cov­ered from the coro­n­avirus.</p>
    <p>“By this time, I know I have hun­dreds of pro­duc­tion crew mem­bers wait­ing for me to come to work so we can start our day,” he said.</p>
    <p>“So I did what I had to do. I pushed, pulled and ripped the gate com­pletely off my­self.</p>
    <p>“Tore it out of the brick wall, sev­ered the steel hy­draulics and threw it on the grass.”</p>
    <p>The Ju­manji (2017, 2019) ac­tor added that his se­cu­rity team met the gate tech­ni­cian and welders about an hour later and they were ap­par­ently “in dis­be­lief and equally scared” at the out­come due to his strength.</p>
    <p>He con­cluded by say­ing: “And I think I’m ready to be #black­adam”. He was re­fer­ring to the DC Comics char­ac­ter he would be play­ing soon in the new movie Black Adam.</p>
    <p>Johnson joked that he might hop over the gates and call Uber if he en­coun­tered the same thing in fu­ture, but changed his mind later, say­ing: “There’s no fun in that.”</p>
