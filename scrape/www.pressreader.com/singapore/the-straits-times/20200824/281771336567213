    <p>Repub­li­cans are gear­ing up to for­mally nom­i­nate Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump as the party’s choice to run for the White House at this week’s Repub­li­can Na­tional Con­ven­tion (RNC) from to­day to Thurs­day.</p>
    <p>Much like the Demo­cratic Na­tional Con­ven­tion last week, the RNC will be a de­par­ture from the big arena-based con­ven­tions of the past, with fewer in-per­son events tak­ing place due to the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>But a smaller num­ber of del­e­gates will still gather in Char­lotte, North Carolina, for the party’s busi­ness meet­ings.</p>
    <p>At­ten­dees will have to un­dergo Covid-19 tests be­fore they ar­rive.</p>
    <p>They will also have to wear masks, be sub­ject to daily tem­per­a­ture checks and put on badges equipped with Blue­tooth tech­nol­ogy to en­able eas­ier con­tact trac­ing in case some­one later tests pos­i­tive for Covid-19.</p>
    <p>The over­ar­ch­ing theme of the con­ven­tion will be “Hon­our­ing the Great Amer­i­can Story”, and the of­fi­cial nom­i­na­tion of Mr Trump is set to hap­pen to­day.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump will ac­cept the nom­i­na­tion in a live speech de­liv­ered from the White House on Thurs­day, in a con­tro­ver­sial de­par­ture from tra­di­tion amid crit­i­cisms that the fed­eral prop­erty should not be used for overtly par­ti­san pur­poses.</p>
    <p>This year’s RNC was to have taken place en­tirely in Char­lotte.</p>
    <p>But Mr Trump moved the head­line events to Jack­sonville, Florida, af­ter North Carolina’s Demo­cratic gover­nor de­clined the Trump cam­paign’s re­quest to re­lax the state’s so­cial dis­tanc­ing rules and al­low full con­ven­tion halls and no masks.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump later axed the Jack­sonville por­tion of the pro­gramme as the num­ber of Covid-19 cases in Florida spiked.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to me­dia re­ports in the United States, there will be four themes, one for each day of the con­ven­tion: Land of Prom­ise, Land of Op­por­tu­nity, Land of He­roes and Land of Great­ness.</p>
    <p>First Lady Me­la­nia Trump will speak to­mor­row from the White House Rose Gar­den.</p>
    <p>Vice-Pres­i­dent Mike Pence will speak on Wed­nes­day from Fort McHenry, in Bal­ti­more, the site where Amer­i­can troops suc­cess­fully de­fended a Bri­tish at­tack in 1812, a bat­tle which in­spired the coun­try’s na­tional an­them The Star-Span­gled Ban­ner.</p>
    <p>The re­ports also said other speak­ers, who will de­liver ad­dresses from var­i­ous lo­ca­tions, in­clude former United Na­tions am­bas­sador Nikki Ha­ley, House Mi­nor­ity Leader Kevin McCarthy and South Carolina Sen­a­tor Tim Scott, who is the only African-Amer­i­can Repub­li­can sen­a­tor.</p>
    <p>Ac­tivists and or­di­nary Amer­i­cans will also be fea­tured at the RNC and, from early in­di­ca­tions, they are likely to lean heav­ily into the cul­ture wars and stress pro-life, pro­gun val­ues.</p>
    <p>They in­clude St Louis cou­ple Mark and Pa­tri­cia McCloskey, who made na­tional head­lines when pho­tos of them wav­ing a semi-au­to­matic ri­fle and a pis­tol at Black Lives Mat­ter protesters went vi­ral in June. Both have been charged with wav­ing weapons “in a threat­en­ing man­ner” at the non-vi­o­lent protesters.</p>
    <p>Also speak­ing is Ken­tucky high school stu­dent Nick Sand­mann, who was vil­i­fied on so­cial me­dia last year af­ter be­ing pho­tographed wear­ing the Trump cam­paign’s Make Amer­ica Great Again cap while seem­ingly ha­rass­ing a Na­tive Amer­i­can ac­tivist. Nick, who was then at an anti-abor­tion rally with his class­mates, has since set­tled law­suits against me­dia or­gan­i­sa­tions for defama­tion.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump is fac­ing an up­hill bat­tle for his re-elec­tion, with his Demo­cratic op­po­nent Joe Bi­den in the lead in opin­ion polls as vot­ers’ views soured on the Pres­i­dent’s han­dling of the pan­demic and na­tion­wide protests this sum­mer against racial in­jus­tice.</p>
    <p>The RNC will be a chance for Mr Trump and his al­lies to rally his base.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump is likely to seek to cast doubt on Mr Bi­den’s abil­ity to gov­ern and char­ac­terise a Bi­den pres­i­dency as a lib­eral takeover of Amer­ica while cast­ing him­self as a de­fender of con­ser­va­tive val­ues.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump has spo­ken of a Bi­den pres­i­dency in in­creas­ingly dark tones, call­ing it a night­mare, dis­as­ter and catas­tro­phe in cam­paign events over the past few days.</p>
    <p>“We’re the wall be­tween the Amer­i­can Dream and to­tal in­san­ity and de­struc­tion of the great­est coun­try in the his­tory of the world. We’re all that stands,” said Mr Trump at a rally in Scran­ton, Penn­syl­va­nia, last Thurs­day.</p>
