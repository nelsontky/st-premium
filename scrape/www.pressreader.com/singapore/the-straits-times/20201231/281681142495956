    <p>A karaoke out­let has been or­dered to sus­pend op­er­a­tions for 20 days for fail­ing to com­ply with Covid-19 safe man­age­ment mea­sures on Christ­mas Day.</p>
    <p>MZS Fam­ily Karaoke in the Or­chard Road area was found to have al­lowed large groups of more than five cus­tomers on its premises, and to have let them con­sume al­co­hol at 12.05am, said the Min­istry of Sus­tain­abil­ity and the En­vi­ron­ment (MSE) yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The karaoke joint, which was open as a food and bev­er­age (F&B) out­let, stopped op­er­a­tions from Dec 25.</p>
    <p>Nightlife out­lets such as night­clubs, pubs and karaoke joints are still not al­lowed to op­er­ate as they are for now, un­less they are un­der a govern­ment pi­lot pro­gramme.</p>
    <p>MSE added that the police are in­ves­ti­gat­ing 51 peo­ple for not com­ply­ing with safe dis­tanc­ing rules.</p>
    <p>Sep­a­rately, seven more F&B out­lets were fined $1,000 each for breach­ing safe man­age­ment mea­sures be­tween Dec 18 and 26.</p>
    <p>These breaches in­clude seat­ing groups of more than five peo­ple, al­low­ing groups to min­gle, seat­ing groups less than 1m apart, and pro­vid­ing games to pa­trons de­spite not be­ing an amuse­ment cen­tre.</p>
    <p>In phase three of Sin­ga­pore’s re­open­ing, which kicked in on Mon­day, F&B out­lets are al­lowed to ac­cept book­ings for groups of up to eight peo­ple. But min­gling be­tween groups as well as the serv­ing and con­sump­tion of al­co­hol after 10.30pm are still not al­lowed.</p>
    <p>MSE said en­force­ment checks on F&B out­lets will be stepped up over the New Year week­end.</p>
    <p>It added that there will be no fire­works at Ma­rina Bay on New Year’s Eve to cut the risk of crowds gath­er­ing. In­stead, fire­works will be set off at heart­land lo­ca­tions is­land­wide.</p>
    <p>“Safe man­age­ment and crowd control mea­sures will be in place at the fire­works sites to en­sure public safety... Safe dis­tanc­ing am­bas­sadors will be de­ployed to re­mind the public not to gather (in groups of more than eight),” MSE said.</p>
    <p>First-time of­fend­ers can be fined up to $10,000, jailed for up to six months, or both. Re­peat of­fend­ers may be fined up to $20,000, jailed for up to 12 months, or both.</p>
