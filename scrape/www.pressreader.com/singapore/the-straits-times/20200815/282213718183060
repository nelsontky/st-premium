    <p>• China’s re­tail sales dropped last month, of­fi­cial data showed yes­ter­day, in­di­cat­ing that slug­gish con­sumer spend­ing could hold up the coun­try’s re­cov­ery from the coron­avirus out­break.</p>
    <p>Re­tail sales – a key in­di­ca­tion of con­sumer sen­ti­ment – shrank by 1.1 per cent year on year, falling short of fore­casts and sug­gest­ing many are still ret­i­cent about go­ing out to spend money, even as China ap­pears to have the virus largely un­der con­trol.</p>
    <p>The latest data fol­lows a drop of 1.8 per cent year on year for re­tail sales in June. Bloomberg an­a­lysts had pro­jected sales would re­cover to a mod­est 0.1 per cent growth.</p>
    <p>While the sale of goods just crept into pos­i­tive ter­ri­tory, grow­ing 0.2 per cent, the ca­ter­ing in­dus­try was par­tic­u­larly badly hit, with sales down 11 per cent.</p>
    <p>The re­tail sec­tor has an in­creas­ingly i mpor­tant role i n China’s econ­omy as lead­ers look to con­sumers, rather than trade and in­vest­ment, to drive growth.</p>
    <p>A do­mes­tic con­sump­tion pickup is cru­cial as ex­ter­nal de­mand weak­ens, with other coun­tries bat­tling the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>National Bureau of Statis­tics (NBS) spokesman Fu Linghui said the data showed “a trend of steady re­cov­ery”.</p>
    <p>In­dus­trial pro­duc­tion grew by 4.8 per cent last month – the same as the pre­vi­ous month, but be­low pre­dic­tions from Bloomberg an­a­lysts of 5.2 per cent growth.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, fixed as­set in­vest­ment for the year so far was down 1.6 per cent year on year, an im­prove­ment on last month’s data, but still weak.</p>
    <p>“Not the best of eco­nomic num­bers out of China to­day with both re­tail sales and in­dus­trial pro­duc­tion un­der­whelm­ing,” said Mr Stephen Innes, chief global markets strate­gist at Ax­iCorp.</p>
    <p>“The glar­ing con­cerns around re­tail de­mand con­tinue to speak vol­umes that it’s go­ing to take more than stim­u­lus and deep dis­counts on lux­ury prod­ucts to get peo­ple shop­ping again.”</p>
    <p>China is work­ing to bounce back from a his­toric eco­nomic con­trac­tion in the first quar­ter caused by the virus, which had shut down most ac­tiv­ity and forced peo­ple across the coun­try to stay home.</p>
    <p>The coron­avirus – which first emerged in Wuhan late last year – has since shut busi­nesses and de­stroyed mil­lions of jobs glob­ally.</p>
    <p>Unemployme­nt last month was sta­ble at 5.7 per cent, the NBS said, level with the pre­vi­ous month. An­a­lysts have warned the real level of unemployme­nt is likely higher.</p>
    <p>As sev­eral of the world’s ma­jor economies plunge into re­ces­sion, China’s data sug­gests it is gen­er­ally recovering quicker, as the first to be hit by Covid-19 and one of the first to re­cover.</p>
    <p>China’s gross do­mes­tic prod­uct ex­panded 3.2 per cent in the AprilJune pe­riod, smash­ing ex­pec­ta­tions and a mas­sive im­prove­ment on the 6.8 per cent con­trac­tion in the first quar­ter.</p>
