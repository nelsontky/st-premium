    <p>The world is weary of the coro­n­avirus pan­demic, which has in­fected more than 50 mil­lion peo­ple, killed over 1.2 mil­lion, and is fore­cast to cost the global econ­omy US$28 tril­lion (S$38 tril­lion) in lost out­put be­tween 2020 and 2025. Thus, all eyes are on the de­vel­op­ment of a vac­cine that could stop Covid-19 in its tracks. En­cour­ag­ing news on that front has ap­peared with the an­nounce­ment that a vac­cine de­vel­oped jointly by Pfizer and BioNTech was 90 per cent ef­fec­tive in pre­vent­ing Covid-19 in­fec­tions un­der phase 3 tri­als, the com­pa­nies say. This achieve­ment is seen as ini­tial ev­i­dence of the vac­cine’s abil­ity to pre­vent the dis­ease, bring­ing the world a step closer to a break­through in the fight against the health scourge. Rus­sia is also claim­ing that its Sput­nik V vac­cine is more than 90 per cent ef­fec­tive on the ba­sis of data col­lated from vac­ci­na­tions of the public rather than from an on­go­ing trial.</p>
    <p>The speedy de­vel­op­ment and ex­pected ef­fi­cacy of th­ese two vac­cines, among many oth­ers vy­ing for dis­cov­ery and even­tual dis­tri­bu­tion, do pro­vide a balm to a Covid-19-af­flicted world. How­ever, both the time­line of avail­abil­ity, stated to be by early March, and the prospects of vac­cine na­tion­al­ism should pre-empt pre­ma­ture cel­e­bra­tions. Safe trans­port, stor­age and dis­tri­bu­tion also re­mains an is­sue.</p>
    <p>The coro­n­avirus pan­demic still is very much around. Not only did global in­fec­tions ex­ceed 50 mil­lion on Sun­day, but a sec­ond wave in the past 30 days has ac­counted for an alarm­ing quar­ter of the to­tal. In­deed, Oc­to­ber has been the worst month for the pan­demic so far, with the United States be­com­ing the first coun­try to re­port more than 100,000 daily cases. A surge in Europe con­trib­uted to the rise. Clearly, Covid-19 con­tin­ues to be an ex­is­ten­tial threat that must be coun­tered in the in­ter­val be­tween here and now, and a vac­ci­nated fu­ture that lies at least four months away.</p>
    <p>Also, as the vac­cine is likely to be made avail­able to the most vul­ner­a­ble first, it is not the case that ev­ery­one will gain ac­cess to it im­me­di­ately. Much will de­pend on ex­i­gen­cies of pro­duc­tion and dis­tri­bu­tion. For such an es­sen­tial and scarce com­mod­ity, there is no au­to­matic cor­re­la­tion be­tween de­mand and sup­ply. In­stead, the world could wit­ness a dis­play of vac­cine na­tion­al­ism in which rich and pow­er­ful coun­tries cor­ner the de­mand side of the mar­ket, leav­ing the rest to scram­ble over the sup­ply side. Covid-19 would then be rel­e­gated to the global mar­gins and con­tinue to threaten and hin­der the growth and well­be­ing of coun­tries in the de­vel­op­ing world. Hence amid the op­ti­mism, there is a need for cau­tion even with the prospects of a vac­cine. Wear­ing masks and safe-dis­tanc­ing pro­to­cols, no mat­ter how in­con­ve­nient they might be, must con­tinue to guide the be­hav­iour of all cit­i­zens as the world seeks to move be­yond Covid-19.</p>
