    <p>In an un­cer­tain and volatile world, more needs to be spent to save jobs and help those who start off in life with less.</p>
    <p>But this has to be done in a way that is fis­cally sus­tain­able, with the bet­ter-off con­tribut­ing more, said Deputy Prime Min­is­ter and Fi­nance Min­is­ter Heng Swee Keat.</p>
    <p>He made the point yes­ter­day when lay­ing out his min­istry’s plans in an Ad­den­dum to the Pres­i­dent’s Ad­dress.</p>
    <p>He said that while the Gov­ern­ment has sta­bilised the econ­omy and stemmed un­em­ploy­ment through mea­sures like the Jobs Sup­port Scheme, this level of sup­port can­not con­tinue in­def­i­nitely.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore has drawn the equiv­a­lent of 20 years of past Budget sur­pluses to com­bat the cri­sis, he noted, adding that the coun­try faces a chal­leng­ing fis­cal en­vi­ron­ment ahead.</p>
    <p>Covid-19 will give rise to new spend­ing pri­or­i­ties, even as more money is de­voted to supporting fam­i­lies with their health­care and pre-school needs.</p>
    <p>“In par­al­lel, rev­enues will come un­der greater pres­sure from slower global growth in the af­ter­math of Covid-19 and sharper in­ter­na­tional com­pe­ti­tion over tax rev­enues.”</p>
    <p>On the planned goods and ser­vices tax hike, Mr Heng said the Gov­ern­ment will care­fully mon­i­tor the tim­ing of the move, tak­ing into ac­count the state of the econ­omy and spend­ing needs.</p>
    <p>Al­lud­ing to pos­si­ble fu­ture tax-re­lated ad­just­ments, he said a fair and pro­gres­sive fis­cal sys­tem is one where the bet­ter-off con­trib­ute more, and lower- and mid­dle-in­come house­holds re­ceive more in ben­e­fits than the taxes they pay.</p>
    <p>“We will con­tinue to ad­just taxes on in­come, con­sump­tion and as­sets to achieve the right bal­ance, while keep­ing our tax rates com­pet­i­tive.”</p>
    <p>The Min­istry of Fi­nance will also de­velop a frame­work for sus­tain­able use of bor­row­ings to fi­nance ma­jor long-term in­fra­struc­ture in­vest­ments, he added.</p>
    <p>Mr Heng stressed that the goal is to build a strong so­cial com­pact – one with so­cial mo­bil­ity and op­por­tu­ni­ties for all at each stage of life, and more help for those who start off with less.</p>
    <p>“A strong so­ci­ety is our sta­biliser in an ever­more un­cer­tain and volatile world. It has helped us to weather crises, while avoid­ing the so­cial frac­tures seen in many other coun­tries.”</p>
    <p>He high­lighted the Gov­ern­ment’s ef­forts over the years to pro­gres­sively strengthen so­cial se­cu­rity, through such schemes as Work­fare and Sil­ver Sup­port, and en­hance­ments to pre-school, ed­u­ca­tion and health­care sub­si­dies, par­tic­u­larly for the lower- and mid­dle-in­come groups.</p>
    <p>Boost­ing ca­pa­bil­i­ties and build­ing re­silience ex­tend to the pub­lic ser­vice, too.</p>
    <p>Min­is­ter for Trade and In­dus­try Chan Chun Sing, who is also Min­is­ter-in-charge of the Pub­lic Ser­vice, said the pub­lic ser­vice has to con­tend with a more volatile ex­ter­nal en­vi­ron­ment, higher ex­pec­ta­tions from the pub­lic and tighter re­source con­straints.</p>
    <p>To deal with th­ese chal­lenges, cross-agency teams will be­come more com­mon, he added.</p>
    <p>Pub­lic ser­vants will also be re­cruited from more di­verse back­grounds and de­vel­oped dif­fer­ently, with more ex­po­sure to the pri­vate and peo­ple sec­tors.</p>
    <p>“This will keep them close to the ground, and give them a di­verse body of net­works, skills and ex­pe­ri­ences to solve prob­lems ef­fec­tively,” said Mr Chan.</p>
    <p>All gov­ern­ment ser­vices will go dig­i­tal by 2023. Na­tional dig­i­tal in­fra­struc­ture, plat­forms and stan­dards will be built, like the Na­tional Dig­i­tal Iden­tity plat­form which will pro­vide greater con­ve­nience and se­cu­rity for cit­i­zens in on­line trans­ac­tions.</p>
    <p>Dr Vivian Balakr­ish­nan, For­eign Min­is­ter and Min­is­ter-in-charge of the Smart Na­tion Ini­tia­tive, said the dig­i­tal­i­sa­tion push will help de­velop ca­pa­bil­i­ties in the lo­cal in­for­ma­tion and com­mu­ni­ca­tions tech­nol­ogy (ICT) sec­tor.</p>
    <p>He added that the value of gov­ern­ment ICT con­tracts is pro­jected to rise by over 30 per cent this year, to $3.5 bil­lion.</p>
    <p>Small and medium-sized en­ter­prises can take part in up to 80 per cent of pro­cure­ment op­por­tu­ni­ties.</p>
    <p>The Smart Na­tion and Dig­i­tal Gov­ern­ment Group will also work with the Min­istry of Com­mu­ni­ca­tions and In­for­ma­tion to equip less dig­i­tally lit­er­ate peo­ple with hard­ware and skills.</p>
    <p>“This will en­sure that dig­i­tal­i­sa­tion ben­e­fits Sin­ga­pore and Sin­ga­pore­ans, by trans­form­ing how we de­liver gov­ern­ment ser­vices, grow new economic op­por­tu­ni­ties, strengthen the core of lo­cal tal­ent and im­prove the lives of our peo­ple,” said Dr Balakr­ish­nan.</p>
    <p>STA­BILISER AMID VO­LATIL­ITY</p>
    <p>A strong so­ci­ety is our sta­biliser in an ever­more un­cer­tain and volatile world. It has helped us to weather crises, while avoid­ing the so­cial frac­tures seen in many ’’ other coun­tries.</p>
    <p>MR HENG SWEE KEAT, Deputy Prime Min­is­ter and Fi­nance Min­is­ter, who stressed that the goal is to build a strong so­cial com­pact.</p>
