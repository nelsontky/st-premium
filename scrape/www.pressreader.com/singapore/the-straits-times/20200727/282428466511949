    <p>Per­haps it is only apt that the man who sparked Manch­ester United’s turn­around with his Old Trafford ar­rival in Jan­uary would end up scor­ing the cru­cial goal on the final day of the English Premier League sea­son that sealed their re­turn to the Cham­pi­ons League.</p>
    <p>Since sign­ing for United, Por­tuguese play­maker Bruno Fer­nan­des has con­trib­uted a stun­ning 10 goals and eight as­sists in 20 games.</p>
    <p>With his cool penalty fin­ish in the 71st minute, the 25-year-old handed United the lead be­fore Jesse Lingard’s stop­page-time goal added gloss to a 2-0 win over Le­ices­ter City at the King Power</p>
    <p>Stadium yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The re­sult helped United fin­ish third and con­signed the Foxes to fifth place and the Europa League. At Stamford Bridge, Chelsea beat Wolves 2-0 to fin­ish fourth and secure Cham­pi­ons League qual­i­fi­ca­tion them­selves.</p>
    <p>Con­sid­er­ing how United made their worst top-flight start in 30 years with just 10 points from nine games, tak­ing into ac­count how they were ninth as re­cently as Fe­bru­ary, the man­ner in which they con­cluded their league cam­paign was a suc­cess.</p>
    <p>But this is the most suc­cess­ful club in the Premier League era. Third should not be the new first.</p>
    <p>The fact re­mains they fin­ished a whop­ping 33 points be­hind cham­pi­ons Liver­pool and there is plenty of catch­ing up to do.</p>
    <p>And they could do no worse than study what the Reds did right af­ter Jur­gen Klopp took over in 2015.</p>
    <p>In the German’s first sea­son, Liver­pool were eighth. Two years later, they added fire­power with Mo­hamed Salah and fin­ished fourth.</p>
    <p>In 2018, they shored up their defence with Vir­gil van Dijk, con­sol­i­dated fourth place and reached the Cham­pi­ons League final. Alis­son Becker and Fabinho were added last sea­son to keep things wa­ter­tight at the back as they fin­ished sec­ond but won the Cham­pi­ons League.</p>
    <p>Con­ti­nu­ity led to con­sis­tency and the league ti­tle this year. The sim­i­lar­i­ties are un­canny and United, now where their bit­ter ri­vals were in 2017, must build on this sea­son.</p>
    <p>With Mar­cus Rash­ford, An­thony</p>
    <p>Mar­tial and Mason Green­wood scor­ing more than 60 goals, United have the most po­tent strike force in Eng­land this sea­son. It was Green­wood the livewire who pick­pock­eted the ball in mid­field be­fore Mar­tial was fouled by Wes Mor­gan, lead­ing to the penalty.</p>
    <p>Fer­nan­des, who had threaded the French­man through, has been in­spi­ra­tional but there re­main doubts over Paul Pogba’s de­fen­sive dis­ci­pline in a 4-2-3-1 sys­tem along­side Ne­manja Matic. Le­ices­ter’s Wil­fred Ndidi and Wolves’ Ruben Neves are pos­si­ble tar­gets to re­place the Serb.</p>
    <p>Then there is the ques­tion whether Ole Gun­nar Sol­sk­jaer sticks with David de Gea as his start­ing goal­keeper? The goal­keeper was ab­ject in the their FA Cup semi-final de­feat by Chelsea but for all of his high-pro­file blun­ders, they still boast the best de­fen­sive record out­side the top two.</p>
    <p>Yet United rode their l uck against Le­ices­ter – Jamie Vardy was al­lowed space dur­ing a set piece to glance a header onto the wood­work on the hour mark – and could do with a top cen­tre-back such as Napoli’s Kalidou Koulibaly.</p>
    <p>The good news is United’s Cham­pi­ons League qual­i­fi­ca­tion could give them an edge in the trans­fer mar­ket in terms of the $150 mil­lion or so they will re­ceive from Uefa, and added pulling power.</p>
    <p>The Europa League place went to Tot­ten­ham, who held Crys­tal Palace to a 1-1 draw at Sel­hurst Park to leapfrog Wolves into sixth po­si­tion on goal dif­fer­ence.</p>
    <p>Wolves can still qual­ify for the Cham­pi­ons League if they win this sea­son’s Europa League, or make it into the Europa League again if Chelsea lift the FA Cup next week­end.</p>
    <p>GOOD EX­PE­RI­ENCE</p>
    <p>I think the boys have done a great achieve­ment, you know where we were ear­lier in the sea­son, to end up third is fan­tas­tic for them. To­day wasn’t a classic but that doesn’t mat­ter. We need to learn to win th­ese games that we need a re­sult in. ’’</p>
    <p>OLE GUN­NAR SOL­SK­JAER, Manch­ester United man­ager, af­ter his team claimed third place.</p>
