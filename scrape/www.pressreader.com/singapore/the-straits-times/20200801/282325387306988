    <p>• World Rugby has dou­bled its in­ter­na­tional win­dow for the au­tumn Tests, de­spite op­po­si­tion from the English and French Leagues.</p>
    <p>The de­ci­sion by the World Rugby Coun­cil on Thurs­day to ap­prove a tem­po­rary 2020 cal­en­dar fol­low­ing the coro­n­avirus shut­down means that in­ter­na­tional teams can play six au­tumn Tests in­stead of the nor­mal three. That al­lows in­ter­na­tional tour­na­ments post­poned be­cause of the pan­demic to catch up, but po­ten­tially at the ex­pense of club fix­tures. The French Na­tional Rugby League (LNR), which runs French club rugby, said it has taken a first step to­wards le­gal pro­ceed­ings by is­su­ing a for­mal no­tice to World Rugby, ac­cus­ing it of mod­i­fy­ing the in­ter­na­tional cal­en­dar “with­out any real con­sul­ta­tion with the pro­fes­sional leagues and in par­tic­u­lar the LNR”.</p>
    <p>Un­der the World Rugby plan, the Six Na­tions, put on hold in March with one round of games plus the Ire­land-Italy match still to play, will be com­pleted on Oct 24 and 31.</p>
    <p>A rest week­end af­ter that will be fol­lowed by four con­sec­u­tive rounds of in­ter­na­tional matches.</p>
    <p>The Rugby Cham­pi­onship will take place over a re­duced six-week pe­riod start­ing Nov 7. South­ern hemi­sphere gov­ern­ing body Sanzaar has asked New Zealand to host the tour­na­ment.</p>
    <p>The English Pre­mier­ship is due to re­sume this month and the knock­out stages of the Euro­pean club com­pe­ti­tions next month.</p>
    <p>World Rugby said that ap­proval for the tem­po­rary cal­en­dar came af­ter di­a­logue be­tween the sport’s ma­jor stake­hold­ers, bal­anc­ing the in­ter­ests of the in­ter­na­tional game, the pro­fes­sional club game and player wel­fare.</p>
    <p>A fierce de­bate has raged over po­ten­tial sched­ules, with the Pre­mier­ship and French league as well as play­ers’ unions con­cerned over a pos­si­ble fix­ture pile-up.</p>
    <p>“Los­ing so many play­ers for five or six weeks plus a week­end off, which is still a long time com­ing, is a lot,” said Di­dier Lacroix, pres­i­dent of last year’s French cham­pi­ons Toulouse, who pro­vide the back­bone of the France team, in re­sponse to the an­nounce­ment. “We are ask­ing for a bal­anced ef­fort.”</p>
