    <p>• The United States is plac­ing sanc­tions on 11 top Chi­nese of­fi­cials and their al­lies in Hong Kong, in­clud­ing Chief Ex­ec­u­tive Car­rie Lam, over their role in cur­tail­ing po­lit­i­cal free­doms in the for­mer Bri­tish colony, the Trea­sury Depart­ment has said.</p>
    <p>It said Bei­jing’s im­po­si­tion of dra­co­nian na­tional se­cu­rity leg­is­la­tion in June had un­der­mined Hong Kong’s au­ton­omy and al­lowed main­land se­cu­rity ser­vices to operate with im­punity, “set­ting the ground­work for cen­sor­ship of any in­di­vid­u­als or out­lets that are deemed un­friendly to China”.</p>
    <p>“The United States stands with the peo­ple of Hong Kong and we will use our tools and au­thor­i­ties to target those un­der­min­ing their au­ton­omy,” Trea­sury Sec­re­tary Steven Mnuchin said in a state­ment yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Mrs Lam was sanc­tioned be­cause she is “di­rectly re­spon­si­ble for im­ple­ment­ing Bei­jing’s poli­cies of sup­pres­sion of free­dom and demo­cratic pro­cesses”, the agency said.</p>
    <p>The other six Hong Kong of­fi­cials on the black­list are Po­lice Com­mis­sioner Chris Tang, his pre­de­ces­sor Stephen Lo, Sec­re­tary for Se­cu­rity John Lee Ka Chiu, Jus­tice Sec­re­tary Teresa Cheng, Sec­re­tary for Con­sti­tu­tional and Main­land Af­fairs Erick Tsang, and the newly ap­pointed head of the na­tional se­cu­rity com­mit­tee, Mr Eric Chan.</p>
    <p>The four Chi­nese of­fi­cials on the list are Mr Xia Bao­long, direc­tor of the Hong Kong and Ma­cau Af­fairs Of­fice (HKMAO) of China’s State Coun­cil; Mr Zhang Xiaom­ing, for­mer HKMAO direc­tor who had been de­moted; Mr Luo Huin­ing, direc­tor of the Li­ai­son Of­fice, Bei­jing’s of­fice in the fi­nan­cial hub; and Mr Zheng Yanx­iong, who heads the Of­fice for Safe­guard­ing Na­tional Se­cu­rity. The 11 sanc­tioned in­di­vid­u­als will have any prop­erty and as­sets in the US frozen.</p>
    <p>But Mrs Lam, who works closely with the Chi­nese au­thor­i­ties, had scoffed at the prospect of be­ing tar­geted by US sanc­tions.</p>
    <p>“I do not have any as­sets in the United States nor do I long for mov­ing to the United States,” Mrs Lam told re­porters on July 31, adding that she would “just laugh it off” if the Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion sanc­tioned her.</p>
    <p>The sanc­tions are be­ing car­ried out un­der an ex­ec­u­tive or­der Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump signed last month seek­ing to pun­ish China for its moves against dis­sent in Hong Kong.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump has been threat­en­ing to take ac­tion ever since Chi­nese of­fi­cials im­posed a sweep­ing na­tional se­cu­rity law on Hong Kong on June 30.</p>
    <p>China’s im­ple­men­ta­tion of the law, and the re­ac­tion of ma­jor trad­ing part­ners who have crit­i­cised it, could have a sub­stan­tial im­pact on a Hong Kong econ­omy al­ready bat­tered by months of his­toric antigov­ern­ment protests and coro­n­avirus re­stric­tions.</p>
    <p>Last week, the au­thor­i­ties i n Hong Kong drew new red lines on the lim­its of dis­sent in the fi­nan­cial cen­tre, bar­ring a dozen ac­tivists from seek­ing of­fice and ar­rest­ing four oth­ers over so­cial me­dia posts.</p>
    <p>The back-to-back ac­tions high­lighted how much the na­tional se­cu­rity law has strength­ened Bei­jing’s hand.</p>
    <p>Ear­lier this week, China’s sta­te­owned tabloid Global Times ran a story sug­gest­ing a re­cent meet­ing be­tween US Con­sul Gen­eral Hanscom Smith and a pro-democ­racy politi­cian could vi­o­late the new leg­is­la­tion. The US con­sulate yes­ter­day called the sug­ges­tion “lu­di­crous”.</p>
