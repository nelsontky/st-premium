    <p>The fact that Chi­nese-Amer­i­can aca­demic Huang Jing went to work in the United States af­ter be­ing ex­pelled from Sin­ga­pore for be­ing an agent of in­flu­ence was a “tacit ad­mis­sion” that he may have been work­ing for China, re­tired diplo­mat Bi­la­hari Kausikan said.</p>
    <p>Al­though the Sin­ga­pore Gov­ern­ment never ex­plic­itly said which for­eign coun­try Dr Huang was said to have been work­ing for, go­ing to the US would have proven noth­ing if he had been an Amer­i­can agent, Mr Bi­la­hari said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>“In fact, go­ing to the US does not prove he was not work­ing for China ei­ther. Huang Jing com­mit­ted no of­fence against the US – he was work­ing against Sin­ga­pore in­ter­ests, not US in­ter­ests,” he added.</p>
    <p>“But he soon left the US and went to China where he is now em­ployed in a se­nior aca­demic position in Bei­jing. Would he dare go to China if he had been work­ing for the US or Tai­wan, as some have claimed?”</p>
    <p>Mr Bi­la­hari was re­spond­ing to Dr Huang’s re­cent com­ments car­ried in the Hong Kong-based English­language daily, the South China Morn­ing Post (SCMP).</p>
    <p>Dr Huang de­nied hav­ing re­cruited Sin­ga­porean Dick­son Yeo Jun Wei as a Chi­nese spy and de­manded Mr Bi­la­hari prove his ac­cu­sa­tion or with­draw it. He has also con­sis­tently de­nied the charges that got him ex­pelled from Sin­ga­pore in 2017.</p>
    <p>Last Friday, Yeo pleaded guilty in a fed­eral court in Wash­ing­ton DC to one count of act­ing within the US as an il­le­gal for­eign agent un­der the di­rec­tion of Chi­nese in­tel­li­gence of­fi­cials.</p>
    <p>The Straits Times con­tacted Dr Huang yes­ter­day, but he de­clined to com­ment fur­ther on the mat­ter.</p>
    <p>“Sin­ga­pore is a coun­try known for its rule of law, what proof does he have?” the SCMP quoted Dr Huang as hav­ing said on Mon­day.</p>
    <p>Mr Bi­la­hari had ear­lier said that it is “not un­rea­son­able to as­sume” Yeo was re­cruited or tal­ent-spot­ted while he was a PhD can­di­date at the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Pol­icy (LKYSPP) where Dr Huang was his su­per­vi­sor.</p>
    <p>Dr Huang, who is now a dean at the Bei­jing Lan­guage and Cul­ture Univer­sity’s In­sti­tute of In­ter­na­tional and Re­gional Stud­ies, told SCMP: “I knew Bi­la­hari when I was in Sin­ga­pore and have no grudges against him. His com­ments against me are non­sense and un­rea­son­able.</p>
    <p>“He said ‘it is not un­rea­son­able to as­sume’ that I had in­tro­duced Yeo to Chi­nese in­tel­li­gence. What does he mean by that? How can a diplo­mat say that?”</p>
    <p>Dr Huang also told ST on Sun­day that he was shocked by Yeo’s con</p>
    <p>That Huang Jing was ex­pelled as an agent of in­flu­ence has ab­so­lutely no con­nec­tion with his for­mer stu­dent ar­rested for work­ing for Chi­nese in­tel­li­gence is far too much of a co­in­ci­dence.</p>
    <p>MR BI­LA­HARI KAUSIKAN, ex­plain­ing why he could not take Dr Huang’s com­ments se­ri­ously.</p>
    <p>vic­tion and had not seen him since late 2016.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, Mr Bi­la­hari said Dr Huang’s de­nial was un­sur­pris­ing.</p>
    <p>But he added that he could not take Dr Huang’s com­ments se­ri­ously as he has “never cred­i­bly ex­plained” why Sin­ga­pore ex­pelled him if he was in­no­cent.</p>
    <p>While he ac­knowl­edged that his claim that Dr Huang had re­cruited Yeo was spec­u­la­tion, Mr Bi­la­hari said he does not be­lieve in co­in­ci­dences.</p>
    <p>“That Huang Jing was ex­pelled as an agent of in­flu­ence has ab­so­lutely no con­nec­tion with his for­mer stu­dent ar­rested for work­ing for Chi­nese in­tel­li­gence is far too much of a co­in­ci­dence,” he said.</p>
    <p>Mr Bi­la­hari also noted that Dr Huang is a US cit­i­zen who also holds Chi­nese cit­i­zen­ship, de­spite the fact that China does not typi</p>
    <p>He said ‘it is not un­rea­son­able to as­sume’ that I had in­tro­duced Yeo to Chi­nese in­tel­li­gence. What does he mean by that? How can a diplo­mat say that?</p>
    <p>DR HUANG JING, de­scrib­ing Mr Bi­la­hari Kausikan’s com­ments against him as non­sense and un­rea­son­able.</p>
    <p>cally recog­nise dual na­tion­al­ity.</p>
    <p>Said Mr Bi­la­hari: “It is true that in prac­tice, many Chi­nese cit­i­zens se­cretly hold dual na­tion­al­ity. But Huang Jing was a high-pro­file case and in fact he pub­licly boasted of hav­ing dual na­tion­al­ity.</p>
    <p>“It de­fies the imag­i­na­tion that the Chi­nese au­thor­i­ties would over­look such a high-pro­file case.”</p>
