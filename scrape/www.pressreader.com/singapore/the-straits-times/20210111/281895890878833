    <p>•</p>
    <p>Many Bri­tish busi­nesses are swiftly dis­cov­er­ing that they must now pay du­ties on ex­ports bound for the Euro­pean Union, de­spite the break­through Brexit free trade deal clinched over Christ­mas.</p>
    <p>The de­vel­op­ment, which has al­ready helped spark slid­ing freight traf­fic to Ire­land, is part of trade dis­rup­tion that has be­come in­creas­ingly ev­i­dent this year after Bri­tain’s Brexit di­vorce was fi­nalised on Dec 31. Trade has also been badly ham­pered by new Covid-19 border re­stric­tions, with the roll-out of test­ing for lorry driv­ers as Bri­tain races to curb a ram­pant vari­ant of the deadly virus.</p>
    <p>At the heart of the Brexit deal, which came into force on Jan 1, is the so-called “rules of ori­gin” con­di­tion ap­plied to all goods cross­ing the border, which is a key as­pect of all ma­jor trade deals that can rapidly turn into a costly headache for busi­nesses. Un­der the Brexit pro­vi­sion, goods will be sub­ject to a cus­toms levy if they ar­rive in Bri­tain from abroad and are then ex­ported back into the Euro­pean Union.</p>
    <p>For ex­am­ple, if a Bri­tish cloth­ing re­tailer im­ports Chi­nese-made tex­tiles, then it would have to pay a cus­toms charge if it re-ex­ports the items into a mem­ber na­tion of the EU’s sin­gle mar­ket and cus­toms union. Put sim­ply, the rules there­fore de­ter­mine whether an ex­port is con­sid­ered Bri­tish or not.</p>
    <p>“It is clear that many UK busi­nesses ex­port­ing to the EU are go­ing to be hit by tar­iffs,” said Ms Michelle Dale, se­nior man­ager at the Manch­ester of­fice of char­tered ac­coun­tants UHY Hacker Young.</p>
    <p>“Busi­nesses have also been com­pletely blind­sided by the ‘rule of ori­gin’ part of the deal, which leaves them at a ma­jor com­pet­i­tive dis­ad­van­tage when sell­ing in the EU.</p>
    <p>“Un­for­tu­nately, not enough was done to pre­pare them for this. It takes years to build an ef­fec­tive sup­ply chain – and us­ing non-EU sup­pli­ers is of­ten the best op­tion both in terms of cost and qual­ity.”</p>
    <p>The Brexit agree­ment, which was sealed 41/ years after Bri­tons</p>
    <p>2 voted to leave the Euro­pean Union, grants zero cus­toms du­ties if at least roughly 50 per cent of an ex­ported prod­uct is made in the United King­dom. That ap­plies to the ma­jor­ity of UK ex­ports – but cer­tainly not all of them. And the pro­vi­sion is all the more im­por­tant be­cause the EU ac­counts for more than half of Bri­tain’s trade.</p>
    <p>Lon­don-based think-tank In­sti­tute of Gov­ern­ment ar­gues that the com­plex­ity of sup­ply chains means that proof of ori­gin can be dif­fi­cult for busi­nesses to as­cer­tain – and hard for the au­thor­i­ties to as­sess. A raft of Bri­tish re­tail­ers are re­port­edly rush­ing to as­sess the im­pact of crit­i­cal de­liv­er­ies to EU na­tions, in­clud­ing Lon­don’s top-end depart­ment store Fort­num and Ma­son.</p>
    <p>Col­lapsed UK high-street depart­ment store Deben­hams has al­ready shut its on­line web­site in Ire­land due to un­cer­tainty over postBrexit trade rules.</p>
    <p>“At least 50 of our mem­bers face po­ten­tial tar­iffs for re-ex­port­ing goods to the EU,” said Mr Wil­liam Bain, trade pol­icy ad­viser at the Bri­tish Re­tail Con­sor­tium in­dus­try or­gan­i­sa­tion. “We are work­ing with mem­bers on short-term op­tions and are seek­ing di­a­logue with the (UK) gov­ern­ment and the EU on longer-term solutions to mit­i­gate the ef­fects of new tar­iffs,” he added. High-street re­tail gi­ant Marks & Spencer warned on Fri­day that the trade deal would “sig­nif­i­cantly im­pact” busi­ness in the Czech Repub­lic, Ire­land and France.</p>
    <p>The deal how­ever re­moves tar­iffs for Bri­tain’s largely for­eign-owned car­mak­ing in­dus­try, which avoids cus­toms du­ties for cars man­u­fac­tured with com­po­nents made abroad. Nis­san has wel­comed the agree­ment but has not yet in­di­cated what will hap­pen to the Ja­panese car­maker’s largest plant in Europe which is based in Sun­der­land, north­east Eng­land. It had pre­vi­ously warned that a no-deal de­par­ture would threaten the fac­tory’s fu­ture.</p>
    <p>Prime Min­is­ter Boris John­son’s Con­ser­va­tive gov­ern­ment has yet to com­ment on the pre­cise im­pact of the rules of ori­gin on the busi­ness com­mu­nity. “We con­tinue to work closely with busi­nesses to help them to adapt to any new trad­ing re­quire­ments,” a gov­ern­ment spokesman told Agence FrancePres­se.</p>
    <p>Lon­don-based think-tank In­sti­tute of Gov­ern­ment ar­gues that the com­plex­ity of sup­ply chains means that proof of ori­gin can be dif­fi­cult for busi­nesses to as­cer­tain – and hard for the au­thor­i­ties to as­sess.
