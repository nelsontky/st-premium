    <p>When Ger­man Chan­cel­lor Angela Merkel green­lighted the treat­ment of Mr Alexei Navalny in the Ber­lin Charite, prob­a­bly the best hos­pi­tal in the coun­try, it was more than a hu­man­i­tar­ian ges­ture to save the life of the des­per­ately ill Rus­sian op­po­si­tion fig­ure.</p>
    <p>The “red car­pet” treat­ment was also meant to con­vey a mes­sage to Rus­sia: We don’t trust you.</p>
    <p>And if Ber­lin’s mes­sage about its sus­pi­cion over Moscow’s role in the poi­son­ing of Mr Navalny was not clear enough, the chan­cel­lory and the For­eign Min­istry is­sued a joint state­ment call­ing on Moscow to “fully in­ves­ti­gate this act and to do so in a com­pletely trans­par­ent way”. In the world of diplo­macy, the word­ing was ex­traor­di­nar­ily blunt.</p>
    <p>Dr Merkel’s plain lan­guage on Mr Navalny’s poi­son­ing has his­tory – one marked by se­rial dis­ap­point­ment over ef­forts to im­prove ties with Pres­i­dent</p>
    <p>Vladimir Putin’s Rus­sia. The at­tack on Mr Navalny, one of the fiercest crit­ics of Mr Putin, has in­jected a fresh dose of poi­son in bi­lat­eral ties. A se­nior ally of Dr Merkel said this week that a ma­jor gas deal with the Rus­sians must now be re­con­sid­ered.</p>
    <p>Mr Nor­bert Rottgen, chair of the Ger­man Par­lia­ment’s for­eign af­fairs committee, also warned that the Euro­pean Union risked ir­rel­e­vance if it failed to act in the face of Rus­sian provo­ca­tions.</p>
    <p>“Now, again, we are bru­tally con­fronted with the re­al­ity of the Putin regime, which treats peo­ple with con­tempt... Are the Euro­peans al­ways go­ing to end up do­ing noth­ing? If so, then we’ll be­come ir­rel­e­vant, we won’t be taken se­ri­ously,” he told Ger­man pub­lic broad­caster ARD.</p>
    <p>RUN­NING OUT OF PA­TIENCE</p>
    <p>Dr Merkel’s well of pa­tience is run­ning dry. Re­la­tions with Rus­sia took a dive in 2014, fol­low­ing the an­nex­a­tion of the Ukrainian</p>
    <p>Crimea penin­sula and the sub­se­quent mil­i­tary in­ter­ven­tion in the Don­bass re­gion in East­ern Ukraine. Dr Merkel felt mis­led by Mr Putin on nu­mer­ous oc­ca­sions as she tried to play a me­di­a­tory role.</p>
    <p>In May, in a speech in Par­lia­ment, she ac­cused Rus­sia of con­duct­ing “hy­brid war­fare” and an “out­ra­geous” cy­ber at­tack on both the Bun­destag and her par­lia­men­tary e-mail ac­count.</p>
    <p>Al­though the cy­ber at­tack oc­curred in 2015, the full ev­i­dence of Rus­sia be­ing the mas­ter­mind came to light only this year. More than 16GB of data, in­clud­ing con­fi­den­tial e-mails from law­mak­ers, were re­port­edly stolen.</p>
    <p>Tellingly, the normally mat­ter-of-fact Dr Merkel did not hide her own dis­en­chant­ment with be­ing let down by the Rus­sians de­spite her ef­forts to build bet­ter ties. “I can hon­estly say that it hurts me,” she said of the in­ci­dent.</p>
    <p>Rus­sia has de­nied ac­cu­sa­tions of an as­sas­si­na­tion at­tempt on Mr Navalny and even raised doubts that he was poi­soned. But a Ger­man mil­i­tary lab­o­ra­tory team said it found “un­equiv­o­cal proof” that a nerve agent, Novichok, was used against him. Novichok, which dis­rupts the brain’s chem­i­cal sig­nals to the mus­cles, caus­ing spasms and breath­ing dif­fi­cul­ties, gained no­to­ri­ety two years ago in the poi­son­ing of for­mer Rus­sian mil­i­tary of­fi­cer Sergei Skri­pal in Sal­is­bury, Eng­land, in what looked like pun­ish­ment for act­ing as a dou­ble agent for Bri­tish in­tel­li­gence.</p>
    <p>The Navalny poi­son­ing came a year af­ter a shock­ing mur­der in the heart of Ber­lin that is sus­pected to have been or­dered by the Rus­sian state. In this case, a Georgian was shot dead by a Rus­sian cit­i­zen in broad day­light in a park. The as­sailant, armed with a Glock hand­gun equipped with a si­lencer,</p>
    <p>was ar­rested near the scene of the crime. Ger­man at­tempts to seek co­op­er­a­tion from Moscow over the case were stonewalle­d.</p>
    <p>The Navalny case will only add to the fray­ing of Ger­man-Rus­sian ties. The Rus­sian op­po­si­tion leader col­lapsed in pain af­ter board­ing a plane in Siberia last month. Aides sus­pect the poi­son was slipped into a cup of tea he drank at the air­port. As he lies fight­ing for his life in in­ten­sive care, the po­lit­i­cal</p>
    <p>reper­cus­sions of the at­tack con­tinue to un­fold in Ber­lin, with grow­ing pres­sure on Dr Merkel to ditch a ma­jor pipe­line project.</p>
    <p>It’s a far cry from 2005, when Dr Merkel be­came Chan­cel­lor. The signs then were good for closer ties with Moscow. Even in the mat­ter of com­mu­ni­ca­tion, she and Mr Putin had no lan­guage prob­lems. Dr Merkel, who was raised in the east­ern part of Ger­many, speaks flu­ent Rus­sian. Mr Putin, who was sta­tioned in Ger­many when he was with the KGB, speaks Ger­man.</p>
    <p>Dr Merkel also in­her­ited a fairly good re­la­tion­ship with Rus­sia. Her pre­de­ces­sor Ger­hard Schroder was not only per­son­ally on good terms with Mr Putin, but the two had also started cul­tural and eco­nomic ini­tia­tives. One was the so-called Peters­burg Dia­logue, a plat­form bring­ing to­gether civic so­ci­ety groups of both coun­tries. An­other was closer eco­nomic co­op­er­a­tion through plans for a set of gas pipe­lines la­belled Nord Stream.</p>
    <p>How­ever, over time, both projects turned sour.</p>
    <p>PROB­LEMS WITH NORD STREAM 2</p>
    <p>The Peters­burg Dia­logue was over­shad­owed by nu­mer­ous Rus­sian at­tempts to block par­tic­i­pa­tion of do­mes­tic groups crit­i­cal of Mr Putin’s poli­cies. As a re­sult, the plat­form lost its great­est value, open­ness and free ex­change of opin­ion.</p>
    <p>And while the first Nord Stream pipe­line, con­nect­ing Rus­sia and Ger­many di­rectly, was com­pleted with min­i­mal fuss, the new project, Nord Stream 2, has caused a ma­jor out­cry. The pipe­line, which would dou­ble the gas ca­pac­ity, was sup­posed to be ready this year but has run into stiff op­po­si­tion from the US and mainly East­ern Euro­pean coun­tries.</p>
    <p>Crit­ics warn that the gas deal would leave Ger­many and Europe to be­come too de­pen­dent on Rus­sian gas. They also warn that by by­pass­ing tra­di­tional gas tran­sit coun­tries such as Ukraine, Be­larus and Poland, Nord Stream 2 would ren­der them even more vul­ner­a­ble to Rus­sian pres­sure.</p>
    <p>The United States has slapped sanc­tions on com­pa­nies build­ing the pipe­line. Apart from geopo­lit­i­cal con­cerns, it also hopes to sell liq­uid gas to the Euro­pean mar­ket.</p>
    <p>So far, Dr Merkel is stick­ing with the project even though it puts at risk Ger­many’s re­la­tion­ship with its West­ern part­ners.</p>
    <p>HIS­TORY’S SHADOW</p>
    <p>She is also fully aware that she is walk­ing a fine line when it comes to the Ger­mans and Rus­sians. The two coun­tries are bound to­gether by his­tory – for good or ill.</p>
    <p>In the 18th cen­tury, the Ger­man (Prus­sia) born Cather­ine the Great was em­press of Rus­sia for 34 years. She mod­ernised Rus­sia in many ways and her rule is con­sid­ered a golden age for the coun­try. Dur­ing her time, many Ger­mans moved to Rus­sia as set­tlers.</p>
    <p>But in the last cen­tury, Ger­mans and Rus­sians fought bit­ter and bloody wars. In World War II, 26 mil­lion Rus­sians in what was then the Soviet Union died.</p>
    <p>De­spite this ter­ri­ble re­cent past, it was Moscow that helped pave the way for Ger­man uni­fi­ca­tion in</p>
    <p>1990. In the se­cond half of the 1980s, then Soviet leader Mikhail Gor­bachev in­tro­duced fun­da­men­tal re­forms, re­frain­ing from crack­ing down on satel­lite coun­tries, in­clud­ing East Ger­many, that wanted to break away from the Soviet Union. In 1994, un­der then Pres­i­dent Boris Yeltsin, the last of the Rus­sian troops with­drew from the east­ern part of Ger­many.</p>
    <p>Given their his­tory, Ber­lin is caught be­tween grat­i­tude and dis­may over Rus­sia.</p>
    <p>Many Ger­mans say con­tin­ued dia­logue with Moscow is nec­es­sary no mat­ter the many re­cent provo­ca­tions. Pa­tience and for­bear­ance are needed in view of the his­tor­i­cal ties, they ar­gue. Be­sides, Rus­sia, bristling with weapons, is a pow­er­ful huge neigh­bour Ber­lin can­not af­ford to be on bad terms with, they add.</p>
    <p>But other Ger­mans, prob­a­bly a larger camp, want tougher ac­tion. Noth­ing will change as long as the lead­er­ship in the Krem­lin think that they can get away with op­pres­sion, spy­ing, bul­ly­ing and even con­tract killings, they ar­gue. Even if Mr Putin him­self did not or­der the lat­est mur­der at­tempt, “Sys­tem Putin” is to be held re­spon­si­ble, they say; while Mr Putin’s en­tourage may have acted on its own, the Rus­sian leader has to be held ac­count­able for hav­ing en­abled the growth of such a rogue sys­tem.</p>
    <p>In this in­ten­si­fy­ing tug of war over the direc­tion of Ger­man for­eign pol­icy to­wards Rus­sia, Dr Merkel is dead set that Moscow has to an­swer for what hap­pened to Mr Navalny. How far she will go could prove a ma­jor turn­ing point.</p>
    <p>While the first Nord Stream pipe­line, con­nect­ing Rus­sia and Ger­many di­rectly, was com­pleted with min­i­mal fuss, the new project, Nord Stream 2, has caused a ma­jor out­cry. The pipe­line, which would dou­ble the gas ca­pac­ity, was sup­posed to be ready this year but has run into stiff op­po­si­tion from the US and mainly East­ern Euro­pean coun­tries. Crit­ics warn that the gas deal would leave Ger­many and Europe to be­come too de­pen­dent on Rus­sian gas.</p>
