    <p>TOKYO • A Ja­panese bil­lion­aire has said on Twit­ter that he had lost 4.4 bil­lion yen (S$56.5 mil­lion) by trad­ing stocks amid volatile swings trig­gered by the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>In a tweet ti­tled “Deep Re­grets”, Mr Yusaku Maezawa, founder and for­mer chief ex­ec­u­tive of on­line fash­ion re­tailer Zozo, said he lost money through day trad­ing – a prac­tice he has failed to mas­ter. He ex­pressed re­gret over the sum he had lost and vowed to re­cover it through his busi­ness.</p>
    <p>“I was blinded by the virus-driven mar­ket swings and lost 4.4 bil­lion yen through re­peated short-term trad­ing of stocks, some­thing I haven’t fa­mil­iarised my­self with,” the flam­boy­ant Mr Maezawa said in his tweet posted on Sun­day.</p>
    <p>“With 4.4 bil­lion yen, how many peo­ple could the money have been given out to and saved? There’s no end to this re­gret.”</p>
    <p>Mr Maezawa, who has a net worth of US$3.5 bil­lion (S$4.78 bil­lion) ac­cord­ing to Bloomberg-com­piled data, is well-known for his Twit­ter stunts. Ear­lier this year, he said he was look­ing for fe­male ap­pli­cants to be his com­pan­ion on his planned trip to the moon on SpaceX CEO Elon Musk’s rocket in 2023. He scrapped the plan af­ter fac­ing back­lash over the process.</p>
    <p>Fol­low­ers have shown mixed re­sponses to his lat­est tweet on stock trad­ing, with some show­ing sym­pa­thy and some ex­press­ing awe over the ex­tent of the losses.</p>
