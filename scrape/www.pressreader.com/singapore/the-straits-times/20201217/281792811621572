    <p>• China plans to in­clude com­puter cod­ing in cur­ric­ula for pri­mary and mid­dle school stu­dents to help them learn about in­for­ma­tion tech­nol­ogy (IT) and de­velop dig­i­tal learn­ing and in­no­va­tion skills, the Min­istry of Ed­u­ca­tion said.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing its on­go­ing cur­ricu­lum re­vi­sion launched early last year for com­pul­sory ed­u­ca­tion – first grade to ninth – the min­istry made a pre­lim­i­nary de­ci­sion to in­clude cod­ing in IT cour­ses, it said in a state­ment posted on its web­site last week.</p>
    <p>It was re­spond­ing to a call by a mem­ber of the Chi­nese Peo­ple’s Po­lit­i­cal Con­sul­ta­tive Con­fer­ence Na­tional Com­mit­tee this year for cod­ing to be in­cluded in ba­sic ed­u­ca­tion to nur­ture dig­i­tal tal­ent in the coun­try.</p>
    <p>The min­istry said im­prov­ing stu­dents’ IT skills is im­por­tant and it has is­sued guide­lines to pro­mote and reg­u­late cod­ing ed­u­ca­tion.</p>
    <p>The State Coun­cil re­leased a guide­line in 2017 re­quir­ing schools to in­cor­po­rate cod­ing in com­puter cour­ses. It also en­cour­aged the devel­op­ment of in­ter­est­ing learn­ing tools for cod­ing ed­u­ca­tion.</p>
    <p>Chongqing Mu­nic­i­pal Ed­u­ca­tion Com­mis­sion is­sued a no­tice in 2018 re­quir­ing pri­mary school pupils to have at least 36 hours of cod­ing in­struc­tion from third to sixth grade, with the same re­quire­ment for mid­dle school stu­dents from sev­enth to ninth grade.</p>
    <p>Each school should be equipped with at least one full-time cod­ing teacher, the no­tice said.</p>
    <p>Learn­ing cod­ing is not de­signed to en­cour­age stu­dents to be­come pro­gram­mers, but to cul­ti­vate their abil­i­ties to think log­i­cally and solve prob­lems, it said.</p>
    <p>Since 2018, Zhe­jiang province has listed in­for­ma­tion tech­nol­ogy as an op­tional sub­ject in the na­tional col­lege en­trance ex­am­i­na­tion, with pro­gram­ming an im­por­tant part of it.</p>
    <p>Chi­nese par­ents who re­alise cod­ing is one of the best ways to pre­pare chil­dren for a fu­ture that re­quires tech-re­lated skills are en­rolling them in cod­ing classes pro­vided by af­ter-school train­ing in­sti­tu­tions.</p>
    <p>Mr Jiang Chun, fa­ther of a fourth grader in Bei­jing, said he signed up his 10-year-old son for an on­line cod­ing cram course in March and it has be­come one of the boy’s favourite af­ter-school cour­ses.</p>
    <p>His son took the course for two hours, twice a week, and Mr Jiang said he had spent around 10,000 yuan (S$2,000) on it.</p>
    <p>Cod­ing could also help his son de­velop co­or­di­na­tion and log­i­cal think­ing, and an­other ben­e­fit was that he would be less likely to be­come ad­dicted to on­line games once he knew how to de­velop them, Mr Jiang said.</p>
