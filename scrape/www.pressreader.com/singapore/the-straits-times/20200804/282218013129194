    <p>En­tre­pre­neur For­rest Li started small – his first of­fice was a pokey shop­house space in Maxwell Road – but he has trans­formed his In­ter­net start-up into a gam­ing, e-com­merce and dig­i­tal fi­nance gi­ant now listed on the New York Stock Ex­change.</p>
    <p>Mr Li, 42, out­lined his im­prob­a­ble jour­ney from founder of a scrappy start-up to chief ex­ec­u­tive of Sea, one of South-east Asia’s most well­known tech names, at a vir­tual fo­rum or­gan­ised by The Straits Times and The Busi­ness Times, and spon­sored by Guo­coLand. It is the fourth in the Cut­ting Edge se­ries.</p>
    <p>Sea re­ported a to­tal ad­justed rev­enue of about US$900 mil­lion (S$1.2 bil­lion) in the first quar­ter, a 58 per cent jump year on year. To­tal gross profit rose 424 per cent to about US$207 mil­lion.</p>
    <p>Mr Li told panel mod­er­a­tor and Straits Times as­so­ciate ed­i­tor Vikram Khanna that he was in­spired by the fa­mous com­mence­ment ad­dress by Ap­ple founder Steve Jobs when he told the au­di­ence at Stan­ford Univer­sity to “stay hun­gry, stay fool­ish”.</p>
    <p>“The spirit of that speech is, you should do what you’re re­ally pas­sion­ate about in your life,” said Mr Li, who was present at that event.</p>
    <p>“Don’t re­ally think about a lot of prac­ti­cal rea­sons. Just fol­low your heart, and even­tu­ally we will be at the des­ti­na­tion.</p>
    <p>“I think that plays a very im­por­tant role in why I de­cided to jump out of the cor­po­rate world and to turn my­self into an en­tre­pre­neur. I re­mem­ber dur­ing those days, I re­watched the speech, prob­a­bly, like two, three times a day for months, to ac­cu­mu­late the courage to be an en­tre­pre­neur.”</p>
    <p>He founded Sea in 2009 as a game pub­lisher called Garena. Its e-com­merce plat­form Shopee is now one of the fastest-grow­ing re­gional play­ers and op­er­ates across South-east Asia and Tai­wan.</p>
    <p>Mr Li is also a mem­ber of the board of di­rec­tors of the Sin­ga­pore</p>
    <p>Eco­nomic De­vel­op­ment Board and serves as an independen­t non-ex­ec­u­tive di­rec­tor at Shangri-La Asia.</p>
    <p>“We ac­tu­ally didn’t have an easy start,” Mr Li said, not­ing that it was right af­ter the global fi­nan­cial cri­sis, and they had trou­ble rais­ing cap­i­tal.</p>
    <p>“Ba­si­cally, no­body was re­ally look­ing at South-east Asia as a promis­ing in­vest­ment op­por­tu­nity. It was dif­fer­ent from to­day. We pretty much just used our own money, and some money from our fam­ily and friends. That’s how we got started.”</p>
    <p>Those lowly be­gin­nings have em­bed­ded them­selves in the com­pany’s core prin­ci­ples, which in­clude hu­mil­ity.</p>
    <p>“Stay­ing hum­ble is the core (of our five prin­ci­ples). It’s only if you’re able to stay hum­ble that you can serve, run, adapt and com­mit.”</p>
    <p>Sea also grew from Mr Li’s per­sonal love of gam­ing. The com­pany started by work­ing with other game de­vel­op­ers and part­ners to take their games to the re­gion be­fore fi­nally de­vel­op­ing Free Fire, which be­came the most down­loaded mo­bile game in the world last year.</p>
    <p>Mr Li traced this suc­cess to two fac­tors – mov­ing away from com­puter gam­ing to the mo­bile plat­form and en­sur­ing games have lo­cal com­po­nents to ap­peal to spe­cific mar­kets.</p>
    <p>“(South-east Asia) is a very frag­mented mar­ket. Peo­ple speak dif­fer­ent lan­guages, have dif­fer­ent tra­di­tions and pref­er­ences. So over the years, we have de­vel­oped that sense of sen­si­tiv­ity to the sub­tle dif­fer­ences across the mar­ket in terms of the users’ pref­er­ences,” he said.</p>
    <p>From gam­ing, Mr Li went into ecom­merce with Shopee, which has proven to be vi­tal dur­ing the coro­n­avirus pan­demic.</p>
    <p>“We al­ways be­lieve that dig­i­tal trans­for­ma­tion is on the way, so we are pre­par­ing our­selves for the fu­ture,” he said.</p>
    <p>“And sud­denly the fu­ture comes in a very dra­matic way, which means a lot of peo­ple have to rely on us and we be­come im­por­tant for them to still en­joy en­ter­tain­ment through games while buy­ing es­sen­tials, sim­ply be­cause off­line re­tail is not avail­able.”</p>
    <p>His plat­form has also changed the for­tunes of small and medi­um­sized en­ter­prises across the re­gion, help­ing them dig­i­talise and ex­pand their out­reach. He even has a Shopee Univer­sity ini­tia­tive, which trains re­tail­ers to go on­line.</p>
    <p>Mr Li noted that tra­di­tion­ally, sell­ers have to pay an up­front in­vest­ment to rent a shopfront, ren­o­vate it and en­sure the lo­ca­tion is right for cus­tomer traf­fic, which is still lim­ited to the area.</p>
    <p>But an on­line shop cuts those up­front costs, and every shop­per on the plat­form is a po­ten­tial cus­tomer.</p>
    <p>When th­ese busi­nesses grow, they hire more peo­ple for roles such as cus­tomer ser­vice and in ware­houses, which cre­ates job op­por­tu­ni­ties.</p>
    <p>Shopee is also an in­cu­ba­tor for en­trepreneur­s, Mr Li said, as any­one from housewives to stu­dents can start sell­ing prod­ucts and cre­ate in­come for them­selves.</p>
    <p>Cre­at­ing such rip­ples to ben­e­fit oth­ers ex­plains Mr Li’s first name,</p>
    <p>Stay­ing hum­ble is the core (of our five prin­ci­ples). It’s only if you’re able to stay hum­ble that you can serve, run, adapt and com­mit. ’’</p>
    <p>MR FOR­REST LI, chief ex­ec­u­tive of Sea, one of South-east Asia’s most well-known tech names.</p>
    <p>which he chose af­ter watch­ing the movie For­rest Gump.</p>
    <p>“He’s not al­ways the smartest per­son, or the strong­est one phys­i­cally among his peers, but he has a very good heart,” he said.</p>
    <p>“Be­cause of his per­sis­tence and his courage, he lived a very suc­cess­ful and very mean­ing­ful life... by help­ing a lot of other peo­ple.”</p>
    <p>Hav­ing con­quered en­ter­tain­ment and on­line re­tail, Mr Li’s next frontier is the dig­i­tal fi­nance space. Sea has ap­plied for a dig­i­tal bank­ing li­cence here.</p>
    <p>“Our cor­po­rate mis­sion is to bet­ter the lives of con­sumers and small busi­nesses through tech­nol­ogy,” he said.</p>
    <p>His chal­lenge is to hire the best minds across the re­gion to take ad­van­tage of op­por­tu­ni­ties.</p>
    <p>And his ad­vice to fel­low en­trepreneur­s is to re­main pa­tient and per­sis­tent. He said: “Suc­cess is just sev­eral ac­tual miles away from a fail­ure. And it’s all about if you can keep do­ing and keep go­ing un­til you reach the des­ti­na­tion. And don’t give up too early.”</p>
