    <p>NEW DELHI • Bol­ly­wood star San­jay Dutt (right), whose life is so colour­ful and tragic that it be­came the sub­ject of a biopic, has been di­ag­nosed with lung cancer, ac­cord­ing to In­dian me­dia re­ports on Wed­nes­day.</p>
    <p>The Hindi-lan­guage ac­tor, nick­named “Deadly Dutt”, served time in prison for pos­sess­ing guns sup­plied by gang­sters re­spon­si­ble for bomb­ings in Mumbai in 1993. He has also bat­tled drug ad­dic­tion.</p>
    <p>On Tues­day, Dutt is­sued a state­ment on so­cial me­dia say­ing he was “tak­ing a short break for some med­i­cal treat­ment”.</p>
    <p>Press re­ports later quoted a tweet from re­spected film trade j our­nal­ist Ko­mal Nahta say­ing that the 61-year-old has been di­ag­nosed with lung cancer and will travel to the United States for treat­ment.</p>
    <p>Dutt shot to fame in the mid-1980s in a string of ac­tion movies in which he per­formed his own stunts, earn­ing him his nick­name. But he was also strug­gling with sub­stance abuse, in­clud­ing heroin and co­caine, that was said to have been sparked by the pain of los­ing his mother, In­dian screen icon Nar­gis Dutt, to cancer.</p>
    <p>After a break, he re­turned with a string of hits in the late 1980s and early 1990s, in­clud­ing Jeete Hain Shaan Se (We Live With Style, 1987), Saa­jan (Beloved, 1991) and Khal Nayak (Vil­lain, 1993).</p>
    <p>But his life took a dra­matic turn when he was ar­rested fol­low­ing the or­ches­trated bomb­ings in Mumbai, then called Bom­bay, in March 1993 that killed 257 peo­ple.</p>
    <p>Dutt was even­tu­ally con­victed in 2006 of hold­ing guns sup­plied by mafia bosses who car­ried out the blasts.</p>
    <p>He was orig­i­nally given a six-year term and spent 18 months in prison be­fore be­ing re­leased on bail in 2007, pend­ing an ap­peal. In 2013, his con­vic­tion was up­held, but his prison term was cut to five years, and he was sent back to jail be­fore be­ing re­leased early in 2016.</p>
    <p>Dutt has been mar­ried thrice. His first wife, ac­tress Richa Sharma, was di­ag­nosed with a brain tu­mour in 1987 and died in 1996.</p>
    <p>His sec­ond mar­riage to model Rhea Pil­lai ended in 2008 and he mar­ried for­mer ac­tress Many­ata later that year.</p>
    <p>In 2018, a film about his life, Sanju, was re­leased, cov­er­ing the pe­riod from just be­fore his Bol­ly­wood de­but with ro­man­tic drama Rocky in 1981 to his re­lease from jail in 2016.</p>
    <p>His new film, Sadak 2 (Road 2), is due to re­lease on Dis­ney+ Hot­star later this month.</p>
