    <p>I am not sure I like my el­der brother any more. If I run down hu­mid, con­crete Sin­ga­pore paths, he lopes along the moors of Devon where he lives. As he crosses the un­even land, he sees foxes, deer, rab­bits, semi-wild Dart­moor ponies, land­scapes and no peo­ple. On grey, misty days he feels as if he’s on the set of The Hound Of The Baskervill­es. I told him he’s a howl­ing show-off.</p>
    <p>We were talk­ing ex­er­cise – broth­ers com­pete even across the oceans – and ways to sweat off worry in a time of Covid. Noth­ing il­lus­trates en­durance bet­ter than the end­less road. In a time of sick­ness this is where we clear the mind and feel alive. As my friend Karen, a reg­u­lar run­ner who is now even more con­sis­tent, put it per­fectly: “I used to run for van­ity, now I run for sanity.”</p>
    <p>When I look out of my win­dow I see a stream of huf­fers and puffers, pa­trollers and am­blers, strid­ers and cy­clists. Yes­ter­day, a grey-haired walker with a white um­brella strode down my lane. He ap­peared to clench his fist and flex his arm and per­haps he was only loos­en­ing up. But it al­most looked like he was bran­dish­ing his fist at an un­seen en­emy. By walk­ing, you see, he was tak­ing on the virus.</p>
    <p>Peo­ple ex­er­cise to shed calo­ries, find calm­ness and show off on dat­ing web­sites. But it also set­tles the nerves, en­sures dis­ci­pline, builds re­solve and de­mands fo­cus, so many of the things we re­quire to arm our­selves in a cri­sis. The great­est com­pe­ti­tions any­way, ath­letes will tell you, are with the self. We can’t con­trol the virus, but we can our re­sponses.</p>
    <p>A 59-year-old friend in In­dia, who I speak to on most days, con­verses while walk­ing down the cor­ri­dor of her flat. On this short run­way she has taken healthy flight. Ev­ery day she walks 10km and then re­cites her weight loss as if it is an Olympic tri­umph. It is if you con­sider that pre-Covid her ex­er­cise was re­stricted to re­peated lifts of a beer glass.</p>
    <p>The virus has awo­ken peo­ple and now con­ver­sa­tions are lit­tered with throw­away lines about Vi­ta­min D, al­mond milk and home­made gyms. One friend even hails his ex­haust­ing work­out in­volv­ing broom and mop. The heft of dumb­bells is ca­su­ally thrown into chats, barre burns are dis­cussed and Has­fit ar­gued about. I used to think Ta­bata was a type of dish till I was bet­ter ed­u­cated.</p>
    <p>Sweat has be­come a use­ful weapon and fresh air an invit­ing medicine. Even ha­bit­u­ally in­door peo­ple are tip­toe­ing into the out­doors. One col­league, wed­ded usu­ally to her screens, has re­cently ac­quired a cy­cle to ex­plore this is­land and her­self. To buy the cy­cle, as op­posed to rent­ing it, en­sures it is a com­mit­ment not a lark.</p>
    <p>An­other col­league, par­tial to dim sum, finds her­self more of­ten in her gar­den, dig­ging and prun­ing, her hands deep in mud, veg­eta­bles, worms and roses. This is her chal­lenge and from phys­i­cal ef­fort, in what­ever form, is built psy­cho­log­i­cal ar­mour. We aren’t im­mune, but we can be res­o­lute.</p>
    <p>The virus is un­com­pro­mis­ing and hu­mankind is cur­rently fa­tigued. We’re a species in search of sec­ond winds and we learn about re­sis­tance when we’re out on our runs and walks. Push, we tell our­selves, one more step, one more kilo­me­tre. It is the in­ner voice which de­liv­ers us to small vic­to­ries.</p>
    <p>Some days I see cy­clists, low on their bikes as they as­cend a slope on Yio Chu Kang Road, their teeth bared in ef­fort. It makes me grin be­cause it looks like the fa­mil­iar burn of lac­tic acid. They’re go­ing to beat the slope, again, and, like any­thing else, per­sis­tence is built from habit.</p>
    <p>The more of­ten we lace up our shoes, the hardier we feel. Af­ter months of no ten­nis, to play again was to re­mem­ber how in­vig­o­rat­ing it felt to be tested. We don’t know our lim­its till we strain against them. It is train­ing that comes in good use be­cause the virus, like a bully, is push­ing us fur­ther and fur­ther out­side our com­fort zones.</p>
    <p>As I write this both my calves have ice packs tied to them, for I was try­ing to run faster on a court than is of­fi­cially rec­om­mended for my age group. But I un­der­stand my sore­ness be­cause I find this time on the court so pre­cious. None of us know if the courts will be locked again and so it feels like ev­ery ses­sion has to be squeezed for ev­ery bit of joy. My part­ner is get­ting more I think, for he is ham­mer­ing me.</p>
    <p>As hu­mans meet virus, sport has a small role. If noth­ing else, we of­ten learn that we’re stronger than we think. There is – like in a foot­ball game – no guar­an­tee of vic­tory, but there is great ben­e­fit to be found in the ef­fort. It doesn’t mat­ter where you are, a swel­ter­ing city or the rain­swept moors, ev­ery step taken or pedal pushed down has the same value.</p>
    <p>They are, in small ways, all acts of de­fi­ance.</p>
    <p>The virus is un­com­pro­mis­ing and hu­mankind is cur­rently fa­tigued. We’re a species in search of sec­ond winds and we learn about re­sis­tance when we’re out on our runs and walks. Push, we tell our­selves, one more step, one more kilo­me­tre. It is the in­ner voice which de­liv­ers us to small vic­to­ries.</p>
