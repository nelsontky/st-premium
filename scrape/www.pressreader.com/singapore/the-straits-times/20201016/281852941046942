    <p>DES MOINES (Iowa) • Un­der siege over his han­dling of the coro­n­avirus pan­demic, Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump has cited what he said was his son’s mild bout of the virus as a rea­son that Amer­i­can schools should re­open as soon as pos­si­ble.</p>
    <p>The Repub­li­can Pres­i­dent made the com­ment about his son Bar­ron while at a rally at Des Moines In­ter­na­tional Air­port in Iowa, on a mis­sion to shore up sup­port in bat­tle­ground states that he won in 2016 but is in dan­ger of los­ing to Demo­cratic can­di­date Joe Bi­den barely three weeks be­fore the Nov 3 elec­tion.</p>
    <p>“I don’t even think he knew he had it,” Mr Trump said on Wed­nes­day of his 14-year-old son, “be­cause they’re young and their im­mune sys­tems are strong and they fight it off. Ninety-nine per cent and Bar­ron is beau­ti­ful. And he’s free”.</p>
    <p>He added: “Bar­ron’s tested pos­i­tive. Within, like, two sec­onds it was Bar­ron is just fine now. He’s tested neg­a­tive, right? Be­cause it hap­pens. Peo­ple have it and it goes. Get the kids back to school, we’ve got to get the kids back to school.”</p>
    <p>Mr Trump has sought to con­vince states to re­open schools, but teach­ers’ unions have fought the move, ar­gu­ing that teach­ers could be in­fected by their stu­dents.</p>
    <p>Fund­ing for pro­tec­tive mea­sures at schools has been caught up in a par­ti­san fight in Wash­ing­ton.</p>
