    <p>Busi­ness was brisk at four pop­u­lar wet mar­kets on the first day of en­try re­stric­tions be­ing lifted.</p>
    <p>As cus­tomers flocked back to their neigh­bour­hood mar­ket­places to buy fresh pro­duce, they still took care to main­tain so­cial dis­tanc­ing.</p>
    <p>En­try to these four mar­kets in Gey­lang, Yishun, Mar­sil­ing and Jurong had been re­stricted since April 22, with al­ter­nate-day en­try al­lowed to peo­ple based on the last digit of their iden­tity card num­ber.</p>
    <p>One of the vis­i­tors yesterday was pri­vate tu­tor Amanda Wong Su-Lyn, 29, who was at the wet mar­ket in Yishun with her mother, who is in her 60s.</p>
    <p>“I was ex­pect­ing there to be huge crowds, but there weren’t – I think peo­ple have got­ten used to tim­ing their vis­its and are keep­ing away when they see too many peo­ple en­ter­ing the mar­ket,” Ms Wong said.</p>
    <p>Yesterday, en­try re­stric­tions on week­days were lifted, fol­low­ing a no­tice­able re­duc­tion in week­day queues. The four wet mar­kets are Gey­lang Serai Mar­ket, Chong Pang Mar­ket at Block 104/105 Yishun Ring Road, the mar­ket at Block 20/21 Mar­sil­ing Lane and the one at Block 505 Jurong West Street 52.</p>
    <p>But the re­stric­tions will re­main in place on week­ends, and other mea­sures such as the use of SafeEn­try for con­tact trac­ing and so­cial dis­tanc­ing guide­lines, like keep­ing 1m away from other pa­trons, will con­tinue.</p>
    <p>Ms Wong was also among those who were re­lieved that these re­stric­tions have been lifted, so she can visit the wet mar­ket on week­days when­ever she likes.</p>
    <p>“Some­times you might run out of that one in­gre­di­ent that you want at home. We’ve got­ten used to go­ing to FairPrice or other su­per­mar­kets, but vis­it­ing the wet mar­ket is a dif­fer­ent ex­pe­ri­ence al­to­gether,” she said.</p>
    <p>NO HUGE CROWDS</p>
    <p>I was ex­pect­ing there to be huge crowds, but there weren’t – I think peo­ple have got­ten used to tim­ing their vis­its and are keep­ing away when they see too many peo­ple ’’ en­ter­ing the mar­ket.</p>
    <p>PRI­VATE TU­TOR AMANDA WONG SU-LYN, on vis­it­ing Chong Pang Mar­ket.</p>
    <p>The Straits Times vis­ited Chong Pang Mar­ket yesterday morn­ing, and found a steady stream of peo­ple en­ter­ing the mar­ket de­spite the driz­zle, but crowd con­trol was man­age­able, and en­try was or­derly.</p>
    <p>“I feel re­lieved that we are al­lowed to en­ter the mar­ket on any week­day. Say, if some­thing’s not in the kitchen, I used to have to plan way in ad­vance just in case I couldn’t en­ter the mar­ket on that day due to re­stric­tions,” said re­tiree Ami­nah Os­man.</p>
    <p>Said house­wife Gertrude Tan: “I have to drive here all the way from Wood­lands, so pre­vi­ously, I’d need to plan in ad­vance, and look out for ‘odd days’ be­fore driv­ing in or I wouldn’t be able to en­ter the mar­ket. With the re­stric­tions lifted, it’ll be more con­ve­nient.”</p>
    <p>But some stall­hold­ers were wor­ried that the re­stric­tions might have caused a per­ma­nent dent in the mar­ket’s crowds – and their busi­ness.</p>
    <p>“It’s quite empty still, maybe it’s be­cause this is just the first day. So maybe it’s un­pre­dictable – maybe to­mor­row, there’ll be more peo­ple,” said Chong Pang Mar­ket butcher Jiang Yi.</p>
    <p>“Be­cause of IC re­stric­tions, there have been a lot of peo­ple that stopped com­ing to the mar­ket en­tirely; they’d rather go to FairPrice.”</p>
