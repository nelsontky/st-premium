    <p>Lit­er­a­ture is not just the study of Shake­speare nor is it an im­prac­ti­cal sub­ject with no rel­e­vance to the real world, a lo­cal sur­vey has shown. A Na­tional In­sti­tute of Ed­u­ca­tion (NIE) sur­vey ex­am­ined teach­ers’ be­liefs to­wards lit­er­a­ture ed­u­ca­tion and their teach­ing prac­tices, even as a re­vised syl­labus for the sub­ject took ef­fect last year.</p>
    <p>Lit­er­a­ture is not just the study of Shake­speare, nor is it an im­prac­ti­cal sub­ject with no rel­e­vance to the real world, a lo­cal study has shown.</p>
    <p>Teach­ers in Sin­ga­pore have been us­ing di­verse lit­er­ary texts in the class­room, with the un­der­stand­ing that they con­sti­tute a pow­er­ful tool to help teenagers see the world from dif­fer­ent per­spec­tives.</p>
    <p>A new Na­tional In­sti­tute of Ed­u­ca­tion (NIE) sur­vey ex­am­ined teach­ers’ be­liefs to­wards lit­er­a­ture ed­u­ca­tion and their teach­ing prac­tices, even as a re­vised syl­labus for the sub­ject took ef­fect last year.</p>
    <p>The sur­vey of 232 lit­er­a­ture teach­ers from 47 sec­ondary schools, which was con­ducted in 2018 and last year, is the first of its kind.</p>
    <p>The NIE team com­piled its find­ings in a pub­lic re­port that was re­leased in July.</p>
    <p>Con­trary to the mis­con­cep­tion that only texts from Western authors are stud­ied, the results in­di­cated that teach­ers are us­ing a va­ri­ety of global texts, in­clud­ing those by authors from In­dia, South-east Asia and Africa.</p>
    <p>About 95 per cent of teach­ers also used texts writ­ten by Sin­ga­pore authors, com­pared with 75 per cent who used texts set in the United States and Bri­tain.</p>
    <p>The sur­vey also found that teach­ers would con­nect lit­er­ary texts to con­tem­po­rary is­sues – and not just limit dis­cus­sion to plot and char­ac­ters – in an ef­fort to help stu­dents be more glob­ally aware.</p>
    <p>About 80 per cent or more of teach­ers would ask ques­tions that pushed stu­dents to con­sider bi­ases and stereo­types in texts, and think about eth­i­cal con­cerns like dis­crim­i­na­tion and in­equal­ity.</p>
    <p>More than 95 per cent of them also em­pha­sised the skills of crit­i­cal anal­y­sis and the ca­pac­ity to per­ceive is­sues from dif­fer­ent points of view.</p>
    <p>The project was led by As­so­ciate Pro­fes­sor Suzanne Choo, Dr Dennis Yeo and Dr Chua Bee Leng.</p>
    <p>Dr Chua is a se­nior lec­turer from NIE’s Psy­chol­ogy and Child and Hu­man De­vel­op­ment aca­demic group, while Prof Choo and Dr Yeo are from NIE’s English Lan­guage and Lit­er­a­ture aca­demic group.</p>
    <p>Prof Choo said the sur­vey find­ings re­flect the shifts in the lat­est lit­er­a­ture in English syl­labus from the Ed­u­ca­tion Min­istry. The new syl­labus gives more at­ten­tion to the eth­i­cal as­pects of lit­er­a­ture along­side lit­er­ary ap­pre­ci­a­tion.</p>
    <p>She added that one of its main goals is to help stu­dents de­velop em­pa­thy and be­come global thinkers.</p>
    <p>“It is not about teach­ing lit­er­a­ture for moral val­ues... It’s about analysing un­der­ly­ing val­ues in texts,” she said.</p>
    <p>“Of­ten­times in lit­er­a­ture we have flawed char­ac­ters... How do they deal with eth­i­cal dilem­mas? This opens up space for de­bate and di­a­logue.”</p>
    <p>There is more aware­ness now that lit­er­ary texts – even those writ­ten by Sin­ga­pore authors – are sit­u­ated in the world.</p>
    <p>For ex­am­ple, sec­ondary school stu­dents read lo­cal text Hook And Eye: Sto­ries From The Mar­gins, which ex­plores themes of mi­gra­tion and iden­tity through char­ac­ters of dif­fer­ent eth­nic­i­ties in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>Said Prof Choo: “We live in a glob­ally con­nected world where there are bound to be dif­fer­ences and con­flict­ing ideas. One im­por­tant aspect of ed­u­ca­tion is to em­power stu­dents to en­gage with dif­fer­ence.”</p>
    <p>Part of this process is to lis­ten to marginalis­ed voices or com­pet­ing nar­ra­tives that are some­times over­looked, said Dr Yeo.</p>
    <p>An­other key find­ing from the sur­vey is the broad­en­ing of teach­ing strate­gies, in­stead of sim­ply re­ly­ing on teach­ers for an­swers.</p>
    <p>Said Prof Choo: “We’re shift­ing away from purely teacher-directed in­struc­tion to more ac­tive stu­dent en­gage­ment, dis­cus­sions and ex­ploratory talk, role-play, de­bates.</p>
    <p>“It might be messy, in­co­her­ent, but ver­bal­is­ing our thoughts shapes our think­ing process as we go along.”</p>
    <p>The NIE re­search team hopes that their work helps de­bunk some mis­con­cep­tions about lit­er­a­ture, at a time when tech­ni­cal skills are in­creas­ingly val­ued and sci­ence and tech­nol­ogy seem to hold many an­swers.</p>
    <p>Dr Yeo said hav­ing the ca­pac­ity to un­der­stand and in­ter­pret texts is use­ful in other con­texts too.</p>
    <p>“Stu­dents are en­coun­ter­ing texts that are not nec­es­sar­ily lit­er­a­ture, but texts they en­counter on so­cial me­dia, memes, TikTok,” he said.</p>
    <p>“We have to be able to dis­cern what is truth and fake news... The skills, knowl­edge and dis­po­si­tion be­ing built in the study of lit­er­a­ture are go­ing to be ap­pli­ca­ble to stu­dents in their daily lives even as adults.”</p>
    <p>He added: “It is not only for peo­ple who are good in English... If you look at the en­tire cur­ricu­lum, lit­er­a­ture... teaches you de­ci­sion-mak­ing, re­la­tion­ships, the way we can get along with other peo­ple.”</p>
