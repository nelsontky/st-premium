    <p>When In­dian For­eign Sec­re­tary Harsh Vard­han Shringla was i n Dhaka ear­lier this month to try and mend a frayed re­la­tion­ship with Bangladesh, one of the of­fers he made was that of a po­ten­tial Covid-19 vac­cine.</p>
    <p>Bangladesh, he said, will get pri­or­ity ac­cess to a vac­cine pro­duced by In­dia.</p>
    <p>“When the vac­cine is pro­duced, it goes with­out say­ing that our clos­est neigh­bours, friends, part­ners and other coun­tries will be part of it,” he told re­porters in Dhaka.</p>
    <p>In­dia’s “vac­cine diplo­macy” comes at a time when its strate­gic ri­val China has made a sim­i­lar of­fer to Bangladesh.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to China’s na­tion­al­ist tabloid Global Times, Chi­nese Am­bas­sador in Dhaka Li Jim­ing has even of­fered to be the “first vol­un­teer” for a phase three trial of the Chi­nese Si­no­vac vac­cine i n Bangladesh.</p>
    <p>Dhaka, af­ter de­lib­er­at­ing for more than a month, al­lowed Si­no­vac’s tri­als to pro­ceed in the coun­try last Thurs­day.</p>
    <p>China has of­fered sim­i­lar pri­or­ity ac­cess to its vac­cine to Pak­istan and many other coun­tries in Africa and South-east Asia in an ef­fort to fur­ther re­in­force its clout.</p>
    <p>An In­dian govern­ment source told The Straits Times that finer de­tails of a vac­cine-shar­ing pro­gramme will be worked out when In­dia is cer­tain of hav­ing a suc­cess­ful prod­uct to of­fer. “When we do, In­dia will fol­low its ‘Neigh­bour­hood First’ pol­icy,” he said.</p>
    <p>But be­fore it sup­plies a Covid-19 vac­cine to other coun­tries, In­dia, which has one of the world’s big­gest caseloads of coro­n­avirus in­fec­tions, will need to vac­ci­nate its 1.3 bil­lion pop­u­la­tion.</p>
    <p>China, on the other hand, could have a bet­ter head start in ex­port­ing a vac­cine, given that it has largely con­tained the pan­demic within its ter­ri­tory.</p>
    <p>In­dian com­pa­nies, how­ever, re­tain the ad­van­tage of hav­ing a longer es­tab­lished track record as a glob­ally trusted man­u­fac­tur­ing part­ner and sup­plier of vac­cines as well as medicines, said Dr Rory Horner, a se­nior lec­turer at The Univer­sity of Manch­ester’s Global De­vel­op­ment In­sti­tute.</p>
    <p>“This may give them an ad­van­tage in terms of hav­ing trusted re­la­tion­ships, qual­ity ap­provals and part­ner­ships with other firms, gov­ern­ments, in­ter­na­tional or­gan­i­sa­tions and donors for the global sup­ply of Covid-19 vac­cines, if found to be ef­fec­tive,” Dr Horner told ST in an e-mail.</p>
    <p>In com­par­i­son, Chi­nese firms do not have a sim­i­larly well-es­tab­lished po­si­tion to sup­ply vac­cines around the world, he added.</p>
    <p>The Pune-based Serum In­sti­tute of In­dia (SII), the world’s largest man­u­fac­turer of vac­cines by vol­ume, has se­cured a man­u­fac­tur­ing con­tract for two lead­ing Covid-19 vac­cine can­di­dates – those from As­traZeneca and No­vavax.</p>
    <p>It has also part­nered Gavi, a global al­liance for vac­cines, and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foun­da­tion to speed up man­u­fac­tur­ing and de­liv­ery of up to 100 mil­lion doses of po­ten­tial Covid-19 vac­cines for In­dia and other low- and mid­dle-in­come coun­tries next year.</p>
    <p>SII re­cently be­gan phase two tri­als for As­traZeneca’s Co­vishield vac­cine in In­dia.</p>
    <p>Bharat Biotech and Zy­dus Cadila, two In­dian firms that have de­vel­oped in­dige­nous vac­cines, have fin­ished phase one tri­als.</p>
    <p>Rus­sia is also ex­plor­ing the pos­si­bil­ity of man­u­fac­tur­ing its Sput­nik V vac­cine in In­dia, whose pro­duc­ers re­main crit­i­cal to any global vac­cine roll-out plan, given their vast man­u­fac­tur­ing ca­pac­ity as well as com­pet­i­tive edge.</p>
    <p>While the In­dian govern­ment is yet to fi­nalise how it in­tends to share a vac­cine with oth­ers, Dr Bhaskar Balakr­ish­nan, a Sci­ence Diplo­macy Fel­low at Delhi-based Re­search and In­for­ma­tion Sys­tem for De­vel­op­ing Coun­tries, told ST that it could do so through the In­dian Tech­ni­cal and Eco­nomic Co­op­er­a­tion Pro­gramme set up in 1964.</p>
    <p>“Judg­ing from sim­i­lar things in the past, the govern­ment is more likely to pro­vide vac­cines and drugs un­der its aid pro­gramme on a grant ba­sis,” said Dr Balakr­ish­nan.</p>
    <p>He added that this ap­proach could be dif­fer­ent from that of China, which has re­port­edly of­fered its vac­cine through loans re­quir­ing re­pay­ment.</p>
    <p>Re­cip­i­ent coun­tries, mean­while, are hedg­ing their bets to en­sure they are among the first to get ac­cess to any suc­cess­ful vac­cine.</p>
    <p>Bangladesh En­ter­prise In­sti­tute se­nior re­search di­rec­tor Faiz Sob­han told ST: “Ul­ti­mately, whichever vac­cine Bangladesh goes for will likely de­pend on the fol­low­ing fac­tors – which man­u­fac­turer is among the first to pro­duce the vac­cine, if they can make suf­fi­ciently large quan­ti­ties... avail­able to Bangladesh, and the cost of the vac­cine.”</p>
