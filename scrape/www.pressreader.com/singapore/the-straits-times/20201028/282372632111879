    <p>Tif­fany Teo in­sists re­demp­tion, not re­venge, will be on her mind when she steps into the cage for the most im­por­tant fight of her ca­reer on Fri­day.</p>
    <p>The Sin­ga­porean will face Xiong Jing­nan for the Chi­nese fighter’s women’s strawweigh­t world ti­tle at One Cham­pi­onship’s In­side The Ma­trix event at the Sin­ga­pore In­door Sta­dium.</p>
    <p>The mixed martial arts (MMA) bout is a re­match from Jan­uary 2018, when Xiong de­feated Teo via a fourth-round tech­ni­cal knock­out with a flurry of punches at One’s event in Jakarta.</p>
    <p>Teo, 30, told The Straits Times: “It’s my chance to show I’m a dif­fer­ent fighter than who I was in 2018.</p>
    <p>“I was raw, com­part­men­talised, and I couldn’t put all the dif­fer­ent martial arts to­gether and work my game plan. I didn’t un­der­stand the game of MMA as well as I do now.”</p>
    <p>Af­ter a pause, she added with a chuckle: “I’ve told this to a lot of peo­ple – the Tif­fany in 2020 would prob­a­bly kick 2018 Tif­fany’s a** if we fought.”</p>
    <p>She ad­mit­ted, how­ever, that the loss to Xiong – still Teo’s only de­feat in 10 MMA fights – stung.</p>
    <p>“I didn’t re-watch that fight in full for a year,” she said. “I couldn’t make it past the first two rounds. I just didn’t like what I saw.”</p>
    <p>She got over it even­tu­ally, and has since an­a­lysed what went wrong by study­ing the full fight at least 10 times.</p>
    <p>“I re­alised I was just lack­ing in some of the re­ac­tion time,” she said.</p>
    <p>“I knew what to do but she was just beat­ing me to most of the ex­changes. I was just a step too slow.”</p>
    <p>Aside from her growth as a fighter, there has also been a ma­jor change in her ap­pear­ance.</p>
    <p>Gone are her shoul­der-length locks, and she now rocks a buzz cut a la Sigour­ney Weaver’s char­ac­ter Ellen Ri­p­ley in the Alien film se­ries.</p>
    <p>Teo ex­plained she had been mulling the move through­out the cir­cuit breaker pe­riod for prac­ti­cal rea­sons, as long hair “gets in the way” when she grap­ples in train­ing and matches.</p>
    <p>It has be­come sym­bolic, too. “Af­ter I ac­cepted the fight with Xiong, I said, ‘Let’s do it’,” she said.</p>
    <p>“I love this look more, and it’s per­fect for train­ing. I shower faster, I</p>
    <p>OLDER, BET­TER</p>
    <p>I’ve told this to a lot of peo­ple – the Tif­fany in 2020 would prob­a­bly kick 2018 Tif­fany’s a** if we fought.</p>
    <p>TIF­FANY TEO, who is proud of her progress in the last two years.</p>
    <p>SHORTER, FASTER</p>
    <p>I love this look more, and it’s per­fect for train­ing. I shower faster, I don’t have to spend time be­tween rounds ty­ing my hair. All those sec­onds add up.</p>
    <p>TEO, on her buzz cut.</p>
    <p>don’t have to spend time be­tween rounds ty­ing my hair.</p>
    <p>“All those sec­onds add up.” Xiong is aware of the progress Teo has made.</p>
    <p>“Since our fight three years ago, I’ve seen (Teo) grow and she has def­i­nitely made a lot of im­prove­ment,” the 32-year-old Shan­dong na­tive said.</p>
    <p>“That pressures me, but I also en­joy this kind of pres­sure as it pushes me to want to do even bet­ter. I think she will con­tinue to lever­age on her ground game for the up­com­ing fight.”</p>
    <p>She de­cided to join the Evolve Fight Team in Jan­uary, and has been based in the Re­pub­lic since. She ad­mit­ted she felt home­sick, but added she has been try­ing to chan­nel that emo­tion to drive her­self.</p>
    <p>“I feel bad for ne­glect­ing my fam­ily but I am clear of what my goals are and what I need to ac­com­plish,” she said. “As much as I miss my fam­ily, I will con­tinue to push for­ward… I re­ally en­joy train­ing un­der the world cham­pion in­struc­tors at Evolve MMA.”</p>
    <p>Xiong and Teo com­bine for 18 fin­ishes – knock­outs or sub­mis­sions – in their 23 wins, and each is tar­get­ing another come Fri­day night.</p>
    <p>“How the fight will go will de­pend on who gets to im­ple­ment their game plan, but I don’t want to leave it to the judges’ de­ci­sion,” said Teo.</p>
    <p>“Both of us have evolved over the last three years, and I feel this fight will be a very well-rounded MMA fight. You’ll see a lot of tran­si­tions, ex­changes, scram­bles… it’ll be ex­cit­ing and in­ter­est­ing.”</p>
