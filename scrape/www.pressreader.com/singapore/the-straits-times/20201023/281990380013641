    <p>A for­mer Sin­ga­porean de­tained un­der the In­ter­nal Se­cu­rity Act for ter­ror­ism-re­lated ac­tiv­i­ties was jailed for six weeks yes­ter­day for flout­ing the Pass­ports Act.</p>
    <p>Zul­fikar Mohamad Shar­iff had falsely de­clared that he had not ob­tained cit­i­zen­ship of an­other coun­try when ap­ply­ing for a Sin­ga­pore pass­port in 2013.</p>
    <p>The 49-year-old, who was ar­rested for ac­tively pro­mot­ing ter­ror­ism and glo­ri­fy­ing the ter­ror­ist group Is­lamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS), had ac­quired an Australian cit­i­zen­ship de­spite hold­ing a Sin­ga­pore cit­i­zen­ship.</p>
    <p>Dual cit­i­zen­ship is not per­mit­ted in Sin­ga­pore, and Zul­fikar has since re­nounced his Sin­ga­pore cit­i­zen­ship.</p>
    <p>Zul­fikar pleaded guilty to one charge un­der the Pass­ports Act yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The court heard that Zul­fikar, who lived in Aus­tralia for 14 years, had ap­plied for Australian cit­i­zen­ship in 2011 with his then 15-yearold son, so that his child could evade his na­tional ser­vice li­a­bil­i­ties.</p>
    <p>Zul­fikar “took no steps to re­nounce” his Sin­ga­pore cit­i­zen­ship when his ap­pli­ca­tion was suc­cess­ful, said Im­mi­gra­tion and Check­points Au­thor­ity Prose­cut­ing Of­fi­cer As­sis­tant Su­per­in­ten­dent (ASP) Ganesh­varan.</p>
    <p>To pre­vent the lo­cal au­thor­i­ties from dis­cov­er­ing his dual cit­i­zen­ship, Zul­fikar would use dif­fer­ent pass­ports to travel to Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>For ex­am­ple, he would de­part from Aus­tralia to Malaysia us­ing his Australian pass­port, and then travel to the Re­pub­lic us­ing his Sin­ga­pore pass­port, said the prose­cut­ing of­fi­cer.</p>
    <p>He suc­cess­fully en­tered Sin­ga­pore on 15 oc­ca­sions with­out be­ing de­tected, added ASP Ganesh­varan.</p>
    <p>When it came to re­new­ing his Sin­ga­pore pass­port in 2013, he falsely de­clared that he “had not ac­quired the cit­i­zen­ship of an­other coun­try”.</p>
    <p>Zul­fikar was ar­rested by the In­ter­nal Se­cu­rity Depart­ment when he re­turned to Sin­ga­pore in July 2016.</p>
    <p>He had made many Face­book posts that pro­moted the ter­ror­ist group ISIS and its vi­o­lent ac­tions.</p>
    <p>The Min­istry of Home Af­fairs said Zul­fikar’s ac­tions con­trib­uted to the rad­i­cal­i­sa­tion of at least two Sin­ga­pore­ans.</p>
    <p>In mit­i­ga­tion, his de­fence coun­sel Lock Zhi Yong said that Zul­fikar pleaded guilty at the first avail­able op­por­tu­nity and is re­morse­ful.</p>
    <p>He also suf­fered a “con­sid­er­able loss of lib­erty” from be­ing de­tained un­der the In­ter­nal Se­cu­rity Act for over four years.</p>
    <p>Mr Lock said Zul­fikar hopes to re­unite with his wife and six chil­dren, aged be­tween 10 and 24, in Aus­tralia.</p>
    <p>How­ever, the prose­cut­ing of­fi­cer said Zul­fikar had “de­lib­er­ately planned his travel route” to avoid de­tec­tion by the au­thor­i­ties.</p>
    <p>His sen­tence has been back­dated to the date of his re­mand on Oct 8 this year.</p>
