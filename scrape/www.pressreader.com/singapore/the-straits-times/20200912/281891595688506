    <p>In March 1950, six months af­ter the Com­mu­nists de­feated Kuom­intang (KMT) troops and won the Chi­nese civil war, Mao Ze­dong launched the first po­lit­i­cal cam­paign in the fledg­ling Peo­ple’s Re­pub­lic of China to “sup­press counter-rev­o­lu­tion­ar­ies”.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing the three-year cam­paign to con­sol­i­date the Chi­nese Com­mu­nist Party’s (CCP) hold on power, at least 2.6 mil­lion peo­ple com­pris­ing KMT rem­nants, land­lords and ban­dits were rounded up and half that num­ber were sent to labour camps.</p>
    <p>More than 700,000 peo­ple were ex­e­cuted, al­though some es­ti­mates put it as high as two mil­lion.</p>
    <p>His­to­rian Yang Kuisong, an ex­pert on the bru­tal cam­paign at East China Nor­mal Univer­sity and Pek­ing Univer­sity, wrote in 2008: “Power seized with vi­o­lence has to be main­tained with vi­o­lence.”</p>
    <p>In Oc­to­ber 1950, Mao threw China into the Korean War, which ended three years later with Beijing and Py­ongyang sign­ing an armistice with Wash­ing­ton and Seoul. That fur­ther con­sol­i­dated Mao’s po­si­tion at home.</p>
    <p>A source with ties to the lead­er­ship, re­quest­ing anonymity, told The Straits Times: “For Mao, to re­sist ex­ter­nal (forces), (one) first must (en­sure) in­ter­nal sta­bil­ity.</p>
    <p>“The in­ter­nal and ex­ter­nal sit­u­a­tion to­day is no dif­fer­ent,” the source said, re­fer­ring to China car­ry­ing out a do­mes­tic crack­down on dis­sent and eth­nic mi­nori­ties as it pre­pares for a pos­si­ble show­down with what it per­ceives to be an in­creas­ingly hos­tile US.</p>
    <p>The clam­p­down has in­cluded muz­zling crit­ics from prop­erty ty­coon Ren Zhiqiang, a mi­nor princeling whose fa­ther was a vice-min­is­ter of com­merce, to Ts­inghua Univer­sity pro­fes­sor Xu Zhangrun and Cen­tral Party School pro­fes­sor Cai Xia in re­cent months.</p>
    <p>Eth­nic mi­nori­ties from Uighur Mus­lims and Mon­go­lians to Hui Mus­lims and Ti­betans have also been sub­jected to an in­creas­ingly harsh “Sini­ci­sa­tion” cam­paign, which in­volves re­strict­ing reli­gious and cul­tural prac­tices in the name of as­sim­i­la­tion and se­cu­rity.</p>
    <p>In July, Pres­i­dent Xi Jin­ping turned the crack­down in­wards, go­ing af­ter his own law en­forcers with a cam­paign to purge cor­rupt and dis­loyal of­fi­cials in the pub­lic se­cu­rity and ju­di­cial spheres.</p>
    <p>De­liv­er­ing a speech to launch the cam­paign, Mr Chen Yixin, sec­re­tary-gen­eral of the Cen­tral Po­lit­i­cal and Le­gal Af­fairs Com­mis­sion which over­sees all le­gal en­force­ment au­thor­i­ties, said that “the sit­u­a­tion re­mains grim” de­spite ef­forts to “elim­i­nate black sheep” every year.</p>
    <p>It is nec­es­sary to “drive the blade in” and “scrape the bones to rid the poi­son” so that of­fi­cials are “ab­so­lutely loyal, ab­so­lutely pure and ab­so­lutely reliable,” he said.</p>
    <p>He in­voked another one of Mao’s cam­paigns, the Yan’an Rec­ti­fi­ca­tion Move­ment in the early 1940s, a purge that so­lid­i­fied the Great Helms­man’s grip on the party and his own the­o­ries on its ide­ol­ogy.</p>
    <p>Po­lit­i­cal watch­ers view this lat­est cleans­ing by Pres­i­dent Xi as the con­tin­u­a­tion of the sao­hei (sweep black) cam­paign, which was mounted in Jan­uary 2018, to go af­ter crime syn­di­cates and “pro­tec­tion um­brel­las” or lo­cal of­fi­cials who shield these crim­i­nals.</p>
    <p>Be­yond a crack­down on crime, how­ever, the sao­hei cam­paign was meant to pu­rify and strengthen gov­er­nance at the grass­roots level un­der the CCP’s lead­er­ship, said As­so­ciate Pro­fes­sor Sheena Gre­it­ens of the Univer­sity of Texas at Austin, who has writ­ten about the lat­est clean-up.</p>
    <p>“There’s this sense that the work from this pre­vi­ous cam­paign is un­fin­ished or was po­lit­i­cally in­ad­e­quate,” she told re­porters dur­ing a re­cent in­ter­view.</p>
    <p>“In the broader con­text, it (the new cam­paign) is an at­tempt by Xi Jin­ping to re­ally push his au­thor­ity, all the way down through the lower lev­els of the po­lit­i­cal-le­gal ap­pa­ra­tus, and to con­sol­i­date power.”</p>
    <p>Since com­ing into power in 2012, Pres­i­dent Xi has em­barked on a sweep­ing anti-cor­rup­tion drive that has taken down hun­dreds of high-level bu­reau­crats, in­clud­ing top mil­i­tary of­fi­cers, and many more reg­u­lar of­fi­cials.</p>
    <p>The lat­est purge is Mr Xi’s “method of rein­vig­o­rat­ing his con­trol of the do­mes­tic se­cu­rity ap­pa­ra­tus – es­pe­cially at a time when his per­sonal au­thor­ity and gov­ern­ing com­pe­tence are be­ing ques­tioned due to the per­ceived weak­ness in his re­sponse to­wards on­go­ing US pres­sure”, said as­so­ciate re­search fel­low James Char of the In­sti­tute of De­fence and Strate­gic Stud­ies’ China Pro­gramme.</p>
    <p>Mr Chen said the cam­paign will run till 2022 which is when the five-yearly Na­tional Congress of the Chi­nese Com­mu­nist Party is sched­uled and a round of new lead­ers will be an­nounced.</p>
    <p>Al­ready, 21 of­fi­cials from the po­lice and ju­di­ciary ranks have been put un­der in­ves­ti­ga­tion in the first week, and dozens more since.</p>
    <p>The most prom­i­nent among them so far has been Shang­hai’s po­lice chief and deputy mayor Gong Daoan.</p>
    <p>“As an au­thor­i­tar­ian regime lack­ing any form of ex­ter­nal checks and bal­ances, the CCP’s purges against its own mem­bers is thus an in­trin­sic mech­a­nism to pu­rify its ranks – we can be cer­tain its Lenin­ist gov­er­nance poli­cies will not change, who­ever is in charge,” said Mr Char.</p>
