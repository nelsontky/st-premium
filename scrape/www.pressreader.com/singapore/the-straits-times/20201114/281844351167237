    <p>Some Sin­ga­porean stu­dents study­ing in Aus­tralia, and those who are plan­ning to pur­sue their stud­ies there next year, are filled with worry fol­low­ing the an­nounce­ment yes­ter­day that for­eign stu­dents will not be al­lowed to re­turn to Aus­tralia in a bid to slow the spread of Covid-19.</p>
    <p>Aus­tralian Prime Min­is­ter Scott Mor­ri­son said the move is to give pri­or­ity to thou­sands of Aus­tralians stuck over­seas to re­turn as there are not enough quar­an­tine fa­cil­i­ties.</p>
    <p>Aus­tralia has capped the num­bers of lo­cals al­lowed to come home each week in or­der to min­imise the risk of spread­ing Covid-19.</p>
    <p>Mr Mor­ri­son’s an­nounce­ment comes af­ter Can­berra be­gan tri­als ear­lier this year to phase the re­turn of over­seas stu­dents next year.</p>
    <p>Den­tistry stu­dent Ryan Chan, 23, who greeted yes­ter­day’s news with dis­ap­point­ment, has been look­ing for­ward to his re­union with his fam­ily in Sin­ga­pore – whom he has not seen for more than nine months – but now has to put his trip on hold again.</p>
    <p>Mr Chan, who re­cently com­pleted his third year of den­tal school at the Univer­sity of Western Aus­tralia, said he misses his fam­ily dearly but is afraid to fly home for the hol­i­days not know­ing if he would be able to re­turn to Aus­tralia in Jan­uary.</p>
    <p>“I Skype my fam­ily quite reg­u­larly but I re­ally miss spend­ing time with them as I live alone in a stu­dent apart­ment here. I re­ally miss Sin­ga­pore food too, es­pe­cially the Hokkien mee in Beach Road,” he said.</p>
    <p>Mr Chan, who cur­rently works as a waiter at a restau­rant, will be start­ing post­grad­u­ate stud­ies next year as part of a six-year den­tal pro­gramme.</p>
    <p>“I have to be in school as I will be tak­ing care of pa­tients and fol­low­ing up on their needs. We will also be do­ing lab work for a few hours a day, such as learn­ing how to make den­tures or prac­tis­ing scal­ing and pol­ish­ing,” he said.</p>
    <p>At the ear­li­est, Mr Chan reck­ons that he will be able to see his fam­ily in July or Au­gust next year dur­ing a se­mes­ter break, af­ter more than one year apart.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, Sin­ga­pore­ans who have ac­cepted of­fers to study in Aus­tralian uni­ver­si­ties are wor­ried they will not be able to travel there when term starts next year.</p>
    <p>Ms Tri­cia Koh, 21, who is pur­su­ing oc­cu­pa­tional ther­apy at the Univer­sity of Queens­land in midFe­bru­ary next year, has paid a $10,000 de­posit to stay on cam­pus for the se­mes­ter.</p>
    <p>“The univer­sity will not re­turn the de­posit, but it will al­low me to use the funds for lodg­ing in the sec­ond se­mes­ter should I not be able to travel to Aus­tralia in Fe­bru­ary,” she said.</p>
    <p>Ms Koh said she has been look­ing for­ward to mak­ing new friends dur­ing ori­en­ta­tion and fa­mil­iaris­ing her­self with the cam­pus – and at­tend­ing classes in per­son.</p>
    <p>“Noth­ing beats go­ing to school in per­son and I want to make the best of my ed­u­ca­tion as school fees are not cheap. My course also in­cludes lab work, so if my first se­mes­ter is on­line, all the lab classes will be pushed to se­mes­ter two and that would be very over­whelm­ing,” she said.</p>
