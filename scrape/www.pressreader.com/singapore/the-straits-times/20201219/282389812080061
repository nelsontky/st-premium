    <p>CARVEY EHREN MAIGUE, 27</p>
    <p>Stu­dent/in­ven­tor, Philip­pines</p>
    <p>Mr Carvey Ehren Maigue, who is from Rizal, a Philip­pine province named af­ter na­tional hero Jose Rizal, knew at age 13 that en­gi­neer­ing was his call­ing.</p>
    <p>His sci­ence teacher had shown the class a movie with a scene de­pict­ing en­gi­neers at work, and said to him: “I hope some day you will be some­one like that.”</p>
    <p>The mes­sage stuck in his mind. Last month, Mr Maigue took home the James Dyson Award’s in­au­gu­ral global sus­tain­abil­ity prize. His in­ven­tion, the AuREUS sys­tem, uses a ma­te­rial de­rived from rot­ting fruits and veg­eta­bles to ab­sorb ul­tra­vi­o­let light from the sun and con­vert it to elec­tric­ity.</p>
    <p>Mr Maigue, who has had to put his stud­ies on hold from time to time in the past be­cause of fi­nan­cial prob­lems, told The Straits Times that he hopes he can in­spire oth­ers as “it is pos­si­ble that the next in­ven­tor, de­signer, artist or leader could emerge from among them”.</p>
    <p>While work­ing on his master’s de­gree in bio­engi­neer­ing and bio­med­i­cal en­gi­neer­ing in Cal­i­for­nia in 2014, Mr Ray Chiu heard the news about a se­ries of ex­plo­sions caused by a gas leak back home in Tai­wan that killed 32 peo­ple.</p>
    <p>The dis­as­ter set him mulling over cre­at­ing a cheap and ac­cu­rate real-time biosen­sor to de­tect and an­a­lyse air chem­i­cals, with the aim of pre­vent­ing sim­i­lar tragedies from hap­pen­ing.</p>
    <p>He co-founded BioIn­spira that year for that pur­pose; the firm was re­branded as Ca­lyx last year.</p>
    <p>It makes sen­sors us­ing a low-cost ma­te­rial based on a non-toxic virus called bac­te­rio­phage. The highly ac­cu­rate sen­sors can be de­ployed across dif­fer­ent in­dus­tries.</p>
    <p>Ca­lyx has so far raised about US$5 mil­lion (S$6.6 mil­lion) in seed money from ven­ture cap­i­tal­ists in Asia and the United States.</p>
    <p>Last year, Forbes put Mr Chiu on its 30 un­der 30 list in the en­ergy cat­e­gory.</p>
