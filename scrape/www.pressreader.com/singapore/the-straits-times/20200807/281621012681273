    <p>Malaysians with Sin­ga­pore work passes will serve a seven-day stay­home no­tice (SHN) in­stead of 14 days as Covid-19 preva­lence rates in Malaysia are sim­i­lar to Sin­ga­pore’s, said Health Min­is­ter Gan Kim Yong yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The de­ci­sion on a shorter SHN is based on risk as­sess­ments and will in­clude Malaysians who are per­ma­nent res­i­dents here who also hold a lo­cal work pass.</p>
    <p>“Malaysia’s preva­lence rates are sig­nif­i­cantly sim­i­lar to Sin­ga­pore’s and, in some cases, lower than Sin­ga­pore’s preva­lence rates.</p>
    <p>“There­fore the risk of in­fec­tion is quite sim­i­lar to a fel­low Sin­ga­porean,” said Mr Gan.</p>
    <p>The Min­istry of Health’s direc­tor of med­i­cal ser­vices Ken­neth Mak said the pol­icy on how Sin­ga­pore han­dles in­com­ing trav­ellers is con­stantly be­ing re­viewed.</p>
    <p>He noted, for ex­am­ple, that the Gov­ern­ment had ad­justed its pol­icy to in­clude test­ing of vis­i­tors to Sin­ga­pore, due to a con­cern that some would ar­rive here asymp­to­matic and in­fect oth­ers.</p>
    <p>As­so­ciate Pro­fes­sor Mak added that Sin­ga­pore’s orig­i­nal ap­proach was to iso­late trav­ellers for 14 days, based on the max­i­mum in­cu­ba­tion pe­riod for the coro­n­avirus.</p>
    <p>But af­ter sev­eral re­views, the au­thor­i­ties found that most vis­i­tors who were symp­to­matic had dis­played symp­toms within five or six days upon en­ter­ing Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>“That al­lowed us then to think about con­sid­er­ing short­en­ing the du­ra­tion of SHN for coun­tries where the orig­i­nal preva­lence (of Covid-19) in that coun­try was low,” said Prof Mak.</p>
    <p>Un­der the Pe­ri­odic Com­mut­ing Ar­range­ment, Sin­ga­pore and Malaysia res­i­dents who hold longterm im­mi­gra­tion passes for busi­ness and work pur­poses in the other coun­try can en­ter that coun­try for work.</p>
    <p>They have to re­main in the des­ti­na­tion coun­try for at least 90 days be­fore re­turn­ing for home leave, and trav­ellers un­der this ar­range­ment can en­ter or exit only via the two land check­points – at Wood­lands or Tuas.</p>
    <p>Trav­ellers who are en­ter­ing Sin­ga­pore un­der this scheme are re­quired to serve an SHN of at least seven days and un­der­take a Covid-19 poly­merase chain re­ac­tion swab test.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore and Malaysia also have a sep­a­rate re­cip­ro­cal green lane scheme that al­lows short­term travel for es­sen­tial busi­ness or of­fi­cial pur­poses be­tween the two coun­tries for up to 14 days.</p>
    <p>Those un­der the scheme must travel via air­ports in Sin­ga­pore and Malaysia which have avail­able non-stop flight routes or through the land check­points.</p>
    <p>Be­fore the trip, they must get ap­proval from the au­thor­i­ties of the coun­try they in­tend to visit.</p>
    <p>All other trav­ellers en­ter­ing Sin­ga­pore must serve a 14-day SHN.</p>
