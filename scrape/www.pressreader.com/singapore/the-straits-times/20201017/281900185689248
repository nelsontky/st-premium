    <p>In 2016, de­spite los­ing na­tion­ally by nearly three mil­lion votes, Mr Don­ald Trump achieved an Elec­toral Col­lege vic­tory by run­ning as an out­sider against Mrs Hil­lary Clin­ton, an es­tab­lish­ment fig­ure with high neg­a­tive rat­ings who, in hind­sight, may have taken cer­tain votes for granted.</p>
    <p>In 2020, Mr Trump, now pres­i­dent, uses the same play­book, pledg­ing to “drain the swamp” and “Make Amer­ica Great Again, Again” and spout­ing neg­a­tive at­tacks on his ri­val for be­ing a dod­der­ing mem­ber of the es­tab­lish­ment, hop­ing again for a nar­row vic­tory in the Elec­toral Col­lege.</p>
    <p>Us­ing the same game plan from last time, and ex­pect­ing it to suc­ceed in this elec­tion, will not work.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump now has a four-year track record, in­clud­ing one in which much of the coun­try dis­ap­proves of his han­dling of the pan­demic, one of the most crit­i­cal is­sues fac­ing the United States in a cen­tury.</p>
    <p>“Keep Amer­ica Great” does not res­onate when the coun­try has more than 215,000 fa­tal­i­ties from Covid-19, 30 mil­lion peo­ple on un­em­ploy­ment and one in five small busi­nesses closed.</p>
    <p>And cur­rent Demo­cratic pres­i­den­tial can­di­date Joe Bi­den has much higher favoura­bil­ity rat­ings than did Mrs Clin­ton.</p>
    <p>With just weeks be­fore the Nov 3 elec­tion, the signs do not look good for Mr Trump. Ac­cord­ing to RealClearP­ol­i­tics’ poll of polls, Mr Bi­den led Mr Trump 51.7 per cent to 42.3 per cent yes­ter­day. An Econ­o­mist/YouGov poll had Mr Bi­den ahead at 52 per cent to Mr Trump’s 42 per cent. Fox News poll­sters had Mr Bi­den 10 points ahead of Mr Trump (53 against 43). How did it come to this?</p>
    <p>It has been a dread­ful few weeks for Mr Trump on many lev­els.</p>
    <p>First, a bruis­ing de­bate per­for­mance in which the af­ter­math fo­cused on whether the Pres­i­dent pro­motes and em­braces racism, forc­ing Team Trump to lose pre­cious time in an at­tempt to shift the fo­cus to is­sues in which the Pres­i­dent en­joys favourable rat­ings, such as the econ­omy and law and or­der.</p>
    <p>Worse, the White House be­came a su­per-spreader site as Mr Trump and more than two dozen key</p>
    <p>Repub­li­cans and White House staff were in­fected with Covid-19, keep­ing the na­tion squarely fo­cused on the Pres­i­dent’s health and, more broadly, his inept han­dling of the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Os­ten­si­bly re­cov­ered, he now holds ral­lies and events where his “law and or­der” mes­sage gets lost in cov­er­age fo­cus­ing on why he con­tin­ues to cam­paign as if Covid-19 no longer ex­ists. Ris­ing cases in many states be­lie Mr Trump’s claims that the pan­demic will soon be be­hind the coun­try.</p>
    <p>A poll taken by Reuters/Ip­sos af­ter the Pres­i­dent’s hos­pi­tal­i­sa­tion found a pal­try 37 per cent of Amer­i­cans ap­proved of his han­dling of the pan­demic, while 59 per cent dis­ap­proved. With no vac­cine in sight by elec­tion day, Mr Trump has run out of time to con­vince Amer­i­cans he has com­pe­tently ad­dressed the pan­demic, or that he can ever do so.</p>
    <p>Apart from the lat­est na­tional polling av­er­age of nearly 10 points, Mr Bi­den also leads in three bat­tle­ground states that gave Mr Trump his nar­row Elec­toral Col­lege vic­tory: Michi­gan (+7.2 points), Penn­syl­va­nia (+6.5) and Wis­con­sin (+6.3). Fur­ther, the Trump cam­paign does not have the fi­nan­cial re­sources to dom­i­nate its chal­lenger across all ad­ver­tis­ing plat­forms, an un­usual sit­u­a­tion for an in­cum­bent.</p>
    <p>At least the Pres­i­dent now out­spends the Bi­den cam­paign by US$150,000 (S$204,000) a day on Face­book af­ter hav­ing fallen be­hind from mid-Au­gust to last month, though the Bi­den cam­paign shock­ingly out­spent the Trump cam­paign by US$53 mil­lion on tele­vi­sion in the month of Septem­ber, and it ap­pears that the Bi­den cam­paign will be at least on a level play­ing field from now till elec­tion day.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, Mr Trump trails his chal­lenger in Ari­zona, Iowa, Florida, North Carolina and Ohio, all states he won last time.</p>
    <p>While any­thing can hap­pen between now and elec­tion day – it’s 2020 af­ter all – signs that have in the past pre­dicted the even­tual win­ner, from vot­ing pref­er­ences in bat­tle­ground states to shifts by crit­i­cal se­nior vot­ers, sug­gest a strong Bi­den vic­tory is on the cards.</p>
    <p>SE­NIORS BREAK­ING FOR BI­DEN</p>
    <p>Gen­er­ally, de­mo­graphic groups favour one party over the other, as peo­ple in the same cohort have sim­i­lar views and are im­pacted the same by poli­cies.</p>
    <p>For ex­am­ple, with cli­mate change and in­come equal­ity as two of their most press­ing con­cerns, younger vot­ers typ­i­cally sup­port Demo­cratic can­di­dates, whom they be­lieve bet­ter align with their views on th­ese is­sues.</p>
    <p>Break­ing the op­po­site way, start­ing in 2008 and ac­cel­er­at­ing for the past four years, white vot­ers with­out a col­lege ed­u­ca­tion</p>
    <p>iden­tify more with the Repub­li­can Party, given their anti-glob­al­i­sa­tion and so­cial is­sue po­si­tions such as on abor­tion. Mr Trump ex­horts his base fur­ther with ap­peals to the pol­i­tics of race.</p>
    <p>While young vot­ers re­main un­changed in their loy­al­ties, the “se­niors” have shifted.</p>
    <p>In 2016, vot­ers aged 65 and older sup­ported Mr Trump over Mrs Clin­ton by seven points.</p>
    <p>Now, Mr Bi­den has a 25 plus point lead over Mr Trump na­tion­ally among vot­ers aged 65 and above in an NBC/Wall Street Jour­nal poll.</p>
    <p>With eight out of 10 Covid-19-re­lated deaths re­ported among adults aged 65 years and older, and se­niors iso­lat­ing from their fam­i­lies, it is no sur­prise that more and more, vot­ers in this age group do not want to see him get a sec­ond term. Many know the vic­tims of this ter­ri­ble pan­demic and are go­ing to vote like their lives de­pend on it – and it will not be for Mr Trump.</p>
    <p>Ax­ios re­ports that the Trump cam­paign, in re­sponse, will launch an “eight-fig­ure” ad­ver­tis­ing cam­paign aimed at re­cov­er­ing the Pres­i­dent’s stand­ing among se­nior ci­ti­zens.</p>
    <p>In ad­di­tion to try­ing to keep se­niors in his col­umn, the Trump cam­paign will try to peel off other de­mo­graphic groups from Mr Bi­den, fo­cus­ing on black men and also on sub­ur­ban col­lege-ed­u­cated women whom he par­tic­u­larly tar­gets with his racist-tinged mes­sages, such as his tweet to “the Sub­ur­ban House­wives of Amer­ica” that “Bi­den will de­stroy your neigh­bour­hood and your Amer­i­can Dream”.</p>
    <p>While such mes­sages have been ef­fec­tive in past cam­paigns, they work much more ef­fec­tively when it comes from a chal­lenger. It is also hard to see how a two-week ad buy will off­set the bad news on Covid-19 – a daily re­minder of the ad­min­is­tra­tion’s mis­han­dling of the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>FLORIDA, FLORIDA, FLORIDA</p>
    <p>Florida can be won by ei­ther party. Mr Barack Obama and Mr Ge­orge W. Bush each won it twice.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump won it last time by less than two points.</p>
    <p>Florida mat­ters be­cause no re­al­is­tic path to the 270 votes needed in the Elec­toral Col­lege ex­ists for Mr Trump with­out win­ning the state, the third-largest prize in the pres­i­den­tial elec­tion.</p>
    <p>Older vot­ers have a greater im­pact in Florida than just about any­where else as se­niors com­prise 30 per cent of its vot­ers in a state that has an al­most even bal­ance between Democrats and Repub­li­cans.</p>
    <p>With Mr Bi­den all but as­sured of win­ning the en­tirety of the North-east and Mid-At­lantic along with the West Coast and Colorado, Mr Trump can ill af­ford to lose the Sun­shine State’s 29 elec­toral votes.</p>
    <p>While Mr Trump car­ried Florida by just over 113,000 votes in 2016, he won se­nior vot­ers by nearly 330,000.</p>
    <p>He can­not win in 2020 with­out them.</p>
    <p>The Bi­den cam­paign strongly pushes the mes­sage that Mr Trump failed se­niors when it comes to Covid-19, such as in a com­mer­cial run­ning in Florida in which a grand­mother says with sad­ness: “While I don’t blame Don­ald Trump for the virus, I blame him for his lack of ac­tion. And be­cause of that, we’re sit­ting here Zoom­ing or FaceTim­ing with our grand­chil­dren in­stead of hug­ging and kiss­ing them. And that’s hard.”</p>
    <p>A Quin­nip­iac poll re­leased on</p>
    <p>Oct 7 showed Mr Bi­den lead­ing Mr Trump 55 per cent to 40 per cent among Florida vot­ers aged over 65.</p>
    <p>If Florida goes back to the Democrats, so will the Elec­toral Col­lege.</p>
    <p>A GAFFE OR POLLING ER­ROR?</p>
    <p>With all signs point­ing to a Bi­den-Har­ris vic­tory, a ma­jor er­ror by the for­mer vice-pres­i­dent could change the tra­jec­tory of the cam­paign. Given the dis­ci­pline Mr Bi­den and his cam­paign have ex­hib­ited to date, Mr Trump knows he can­not count on that.</p>
    <p>There could be a re­peat of 2016 in which Mr Trump wins swing states such as Penn­syl­va­nia de­spite be­ing be­hind in the polls so close to the elec­tion.</p>
    <p>How­ever, poll­sters and the Bi­den cam­paign learnt their lessons from 2016 when they un­der­counted Mr Trump’s strength with white vot­ers with­out a col­lege de­gree who voted in num­bers larger than ex­pected.</p>
    <p>This time, as pointed out on the web­site FiveThir­tyEight, more poll­sters weight their sur­veys dif­fer­ently by ed­u­ca­tion to more ac­cu­rately cap­ture the ex­tent of Mr Trump’s sup­port.</p>
    <p>Still, polling re­mains as much an art as a sci­ence, and re­gard­less of the num­ber of polls in his favour, Mr Bi­den does not have cer­tainty of vic­tory.</p>
    <p>VOTER SUP­PRES­SION, IN­TIM­I­DA­TION</p>
    <p>More likely than the polls be­ing in­ac­cu­rate, ef­forts by Repub­li­can state of­fi­cials to keep le­git­i­mate bal­lots from be­ing counted to hob­ble Mr Bi­den’s chances of win­ning are a big­ger worry for Bi­den sup­port­ers.</p>
    <p>Voter sup­pres­sion ap­pears to be a grow­ing prob­lem in states such as Florida, Ge­or­gia and Texas. Ef­forts in­clude dras­ti­cally re­duc­ing polling sta­tions and drop-off bal­lot boxes in pre­dom­i­nantly Demo­cratic districts, and rules that make it eas­ier to dis­qual­ify a vote, such as the fail­ure to match the voter’s sig­na­ture against those on record. Or, a slow­down in mail de­liv­ery that leads to postal bal­lots ar­riv­ing too late to be counted.</p>
    <p>Th­ese hob­bling mea­sures are hap­pen­ing as Mr Trump rails re­peat­edly against the use of mail-in bal­lots and their le­git­i­macy in a year when Democrats greatly</p>
    <p>out­num­ber Repub­li­cans in us­ing them.</p>
    <p>Also, with the urg­ing of the Pres­i­dent, Trump sup­port­ers al­ready re­sort to out­right voter in­tim­i­da­tion by send­ing unau­tho­rised peo­ple to polling lo­ca­tions where early vot­ing takes place, and con­cerns grow that there will even be guns at polling places on elec­tion day.</p>
    <p>Not sur­pris­ingly, Mr Bi­den said at a re­cent cam­paign stop: “The only way we lose this is by the chi­canery go­ing on rel­a­tive to polling places.”</p>
    <p>Is the US headed then for a con­sti­tu­tional cri­sis aris­ing from the re­fusal of the Trump team to recog­nise the le­git­i­macy of postal bal­lots that add up to a Bi­den vic­tory?</p>
    <p>While the fears are not un­founded, it may yet be averted if a hard-to-deny blue wave of votes for Democrats across the coun­try builds up from now to Nov 3 such that ques­tions about slow count­ing of postal bal­lots may not even fig­ure.</p>
    <p>Driven by con­cerns of dis­putes over late-ar­riv­ing bal­lots, there has been a huge surge of early vot­ers. Na­tion­ally, 17.1 mil­lion Amer­i­cans have al­ready cast bal­lots by mail or through in-per­son vot­ing, ac­cord­ing to the United States Elec­tions Project, a site run by Uni­ver­sity of Florida po­lit­i­cal sci­en­tist Michael McDon­ald that tracks early vot­ing data. Four years ago at this point, only 1.4 mil­lion did so.</p>
    <p>Democrats ap­pear to be be­hind the surge. For in­stance, over 960,000 reg­is­tered Democrats in Florida have al­ready mailed back their bal­lots, com­pared with 564,000 Repub­li­cans, Reuters re­ported.</p>
    <p>While any­thing can hap­pen between now and elec­tion day – it’s 2020 af­ter all – signs that have in the past pre­dicted the even­tual win­ner, from vot­ing pref­er­ences in bat­tle­ground states to shifts by crit­i­cal se­nior vot­ers, sug­gest a strong Bi­den vic­tory is on the cards.</p>
