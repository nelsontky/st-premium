    <p>With the deep job cuts that have been an­nounced, there will be much so­ci­etal im­pact from fam­i­lies los­ing in­come from their main bread­win­ner.</p>
    <p>So far, the often re­peated ad­vice to most fam­i­lies, even for peo­ple who have jobs, is to tighten one’s purse strings and mis­cel­la­neous spend­ing, but that would not help to achieve what we ac­tu­ally need to re­vive our ser­vice sec­tor.</p>
    <p>We should find other ways be­fore job cuts be­come nec­es­sary. Or­gan­i­sa­tions fac­ing se­vere cost pres­sures could im­ple­ment an across-the-board pay cut (for ex­am­ple, cut­ting pay by 20 per cent) as this al­lows the firms to ease the im­pact from the eco­nomic down­turn while re­tain­ing tal­ent and ex­per­tise within the or­gan­i­sa­tion.</p>
    <p>Another op­tion is to find cre­ative ways to im­ple­ment job cuts. One ex­am­ple could be putting in place a three- to four-day work week and job shar­ing schemes where mul­ti­ple peo­ple share a job and take a por­tion of the salary.</p>
    <p>This en­tails a big re­vamp of how jobs are de­signed in com­pa­nies, but the re­ten­tion of tal­ent al­lows for a quicker re­bound when we get past this cri­sis. Fur­ther­more, if enough com­pa­nies can cut up their roles in this man­ner, peo­ple could po­ten­tially take up other ad hoc roles in their free time – like how some peo­ple take on part-time de­liv­ery ser­vice roles.</p>
    <p>This could en­sure that we fur­ther spread in­come and jobs around, and en­sure that peo­ple con­tinue to re­main in the work­force.</p>
    <p>The spare time a worker has could also be used for self-im­prove­ment and up­skilling while still get­ting some in­come.</p>
    <p>Job shar­ing could be the long-term an­swer for a bal­anced life­style for work­ing par­ents. It can also serve as an ap­pren­tice­ship route for new grad­u­ates to get the re­quired real-world ex­pe­ri­ence.</p>
    <p>Per­haps the au­thor­i­ties could drive this in a big­ger way for com­pa­nies that are con­sid­er­ing job cuts, as it is now even more crit­i­cal to en­sure that work­ers re­main in the econ­omy. Daryl Tan</p>
