    <p>Bri­ton Paul Jonathon Gold was fined $3,000 yes­ter­day for flout­ing safe dis­tanc­ing mea­sures and tak­ing part in an un­law­ful gath­er­ing on Lazarus Is­land amid the Covid-19 pan­demic on Aug 8.</p>
    <p>The 32-year-old was part of a 12-per­son gath­er­ing on the is­land that vi­o­lated Covid-19 reg­u­la­tions that pro­hibit so­cial gath­er­ings of more than five peo­ple who do not stay in the same place of res­i­dence.</p>
    <p>The fine was im­posed in lieu of six days in jail.</p>
    <p>Gold and the other 11 peo­ple at the gath­er­ing were charged on Oct 2 for an of­fence un­der the Covid-19 (Tem­po­rary Mea­sures) Act.</p>
    <p>The oth­ers are: Natalie Joanna Sarkies, 29; He­len Ann Sul­li­van, 30; Zoe Louise Cronk, 30; Jeff Richard Alexan­der, 31; Joshua Adam Roth, 31; Lowri Mair Jeffs, 31; James Riby Oram Trim­ming, 31; Richard Henri Lagesse, 31; Luong Thi Thu Ha, 31; Wil­liam Ed­win Dun­ford, 32; and Ed­ward John Joseph Lee-Bull, 32.</p>
    <p>All of them are Bri­tish ex­cept for Sarkies, who is a Sin­ga­porean, and Ha, who is Viet­namese and has been a Sin­ga­pore per­ma­nent res­i­dent for 11 years.</p>
    <p>The court heard that the group had taken a ferry from main­land Sin­ga­pore to St John’s Is­land at around 11am on Aug 8.</p>
    <p>They then walked to the beach at Lazarus Is­land, where they en­gaged in var­i­ous leisure ac­tiv­i­ties.</p>
    <p>The group then took a ferry from St John’s Is­land back to main­land Sin­ga­pore at around 6pm the same day. Gold was spot­ted in a pho­to­graph posted by Sarkies on In­sta­gram.</p>
    <p>Deputy Public Pros­e­cu­tor Ti­motheus Koh said: “The ac­cused knew, but did not care, that he was break­ing the law.</p>
    <p>“His con­duct be­lit­tles the tremen­dous ef­forts and sac­ri­fices of the vast ma­jor­ity who have, amongst many things, given up the plea­sures of so­cial in­ter­ac­tion with fam­ily and friends for the public good to con­tain the spread of Covid-19.”</p>
    <p>“The court should take this op­por­tu­nity to send a clear de­ter­rent mes­sage that we must con­tinue to re­main vig­i­lant, and that ret­ri­bu­tion against of­fend­ers dur­ing this time of cri­sis will be swift and cer­tain,” the DPP added.</p>
    <p>In his mit­i­ga­tion plea, de­fence lawyer Anil Singh asked for le­niency, as Gold has since been dis­missed from his job at real es­tate in­vest­ment firm Jones Lang LaSalle and will likely “not be able to re-en­ter Sin­ga­pore again”.</p>
    <p>Checks on Gold’s em­ploy­ment pass sta­tus on the Min­istry of Man­power web­site showed that it was can­celled on Sept 21.</p>
    <p>The cases in­volv­ing the re­main­ing 11 peo­ple will be heard on Oct 23. If found guilty, first-time of­fend­ers can be jailed for up to six months and fined up to $10,000.</p>
    <p>Re­peat of­fend­ers can be jailed for up to a year and fined up to $20,000.</p>
