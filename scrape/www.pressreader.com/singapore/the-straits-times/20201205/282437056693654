    <p>NEW YORK • Min­iso Group Hold­ing, the Chi­nese bud­get life­style goods re­tailer, is mak­ing its first foray into the US$86 bil­lion (S$114.6 bil­lion) global toy mar­ket as it tries to take on heavy­weights like Toys ‘R’ Us on its home turf and beyond.</p>
    <p>Known for sell­ing low-cost items rang­ing from house­hold goods to elec­tronic gad­gets with a clean aes­thetic, Min­iso will open the first store of its new chain, Top­toy, this month in Guangzhou, founder and chief ex­ec­u­tive Ye Guofu told Bloomberg in an ex­clu­sive in­ter­view last month.</p>
    <p>The com­pany’s en­try into toy stores comes shortly af­ter Min­iso went pub­lic in the United States as it rides a global boom in dis­count re­tail­ers ac­cel­er­ated by the pan­demic’s eco­nomic dev­as­ta­tion.</p>
    <p>Min­iso is now hop­ing its low prices and pop­u­lar­ity can give it a foothold in China’s US$12 bil­lion toy mar­ket, which Mr Ye says is bi­fur­cated be­tween “old-fash­ioned”, higher-end re­tail­ers like Toys ‘R’ Us, and cheap, low-qual­ity goods ped­dled at small stores and su­per­mar­kets.</p>
    <p>“China still doesn’t have a good home-grown toy brand to serve chil­dren,” said Mr Ye, a for­mer pipe fac­tory worker who be­came a bil­lion­aire fol­low­ing Min­iso’s ini­tial pub­lic of­fer­ing (IPO).</p>
    <p>Top­toy will dif­fer­en­ti­ate it­self from tra­di­tional toy re­tail­ers by fo­cus­ing on spe­cific prod­ucts pop­u­lar among chil­dren and young adults in China, like so-called “pop toys” – col­lectable car­toon fig­urines – and 40 yuan (S$8.15) “blind boxes” con­tain­ing dolls based on anime char­ac­ters. Buy­ers do not know what they get ex­actly in blind boxes un­til af­ter pur­chase, and the el­e­ment of luck adds to the fun.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to Bloomberg In­tel­li­gence, China’s toy mar­ket is slated to be­come the big­gest in the world by 2022, pass­ing the US$25 bil­lion US in­dus­try.</p>
    <p>Since its found­ing in 2013, Min­iso now op­er­ates more than 4,200 stores, of which 60 per cent are in China and the rest scat­tered across 80 coun­tries, in­clud­ing the US. More than 95 per cent of its goods in China are priced at 50 yuan or less, in­clud­ing ex­ist­ing toy ranges that are co-branded with for­eign names such as Marvel and Dis­ney.</p>
    <p>Min­iso is dom­i­nant in its cur­rent mar­ket – it has a nearly 60 per cent share in the gen­eral mer­chan­dise</p>
    <p>Min­iso is now hop­ing its low prices and pop­u­lar­ity can give it a foothold in China’s US$12 bil­lion (S$16 bil­lion) toy mar­ket, which Mr Ye Guofu says is bi­fur­cated be­tween “old-fash­ioned”, higher-end re­tail­ers like Toys ‘R’ Us, and cheap, low-qual­ity goods ped­dled at small stores and su­per­mar­kets.</p>
    <p>mar­ket, ex­clud­ing gro­cery sto­ries, with Ja­panese brand Muji a dis­tant sec­ond at 13 per cent, ac­cord­ing to data from Euromon­i­tor In­ter­na­tional. But in toys, it will face stiff com­pe­ti­tion from for­eign brands jostling for a slice of the world’s fastest-grow­ing toy mar­ket.</p>
    <p>While toy re­tail­ers have shut­tered stores in the US and other ma</p>
    <p>ture mar­kets due to the pop­u­lar­ity of e-com­merce, toy stores con­tinue to en­joy rapid growth in China, where many par­ents en­joy tak­ing their chil­dren to phys­i­cal shops for in­ter­ac­tive ex­pe­ri­ences.</p>
    <p>Toys ‘R’ Us, which filed for bank­ruptcy in the US in 2017, op­er­ates more than 180 stores in China in part­ner­ship with Hong Kong-based</p>
    <p>Fung Re­tail­ing, and has about a 12 per cent mar­ket share among toy chains in China, ac­cord­ing to Euromon­i­tor. New York toy store FAO Sch­warz en­tered China last year, while Lego Group plans to open dozens more stores in the coun­try.</p>
    <p>Mr Ye, who was in­spired by Ja­pan’s dis­count stores as well as brands like Uniqlo, Ikea and</p>
    <p>Costco Whole­sale, hopes that Min­iso’s model of sell­ing low-cost, well-de­signed prod­ucts can be trans­posed to the toy sec­tor.</p>
    <p>The com­pany’s net­work with local sup­pli­ers means it can en­sure prod­uct qual­ity at low prices, he said. As an ex­am­ple, he pointed out that one of Min­iso’s sup­pli­ers, which also sup­plies to French lux­ury house Chris­tian Dior, pro­duces a rose per­fume that re­tails at 15 yuan for 15ml.</p>
    <p>The main chal­lenge for Min­iso’s ex­pan­sion plans, Mr Ye said, is the pan­demic, which has slowed busi­ness in its stores all around the world. Still, he said ex­pan­sion will con­tinue apace – since its Oc­to­ber IPO, Min­iso has opened 100 new out­lets around the world, and aims to open hun­dreds more ev­ery year in the next decade both in China and abroad. Af­ter Guangzhou, Top­toy stores are planned for Shen­zhen and other Chi­nese cities, he said.</p>
