    <p>The five women still with the sect are fiercely loyal to the al­leged leader. Four of them are de­gree hold­ers, in­clud­ing one who has a mas­ter’s de­gree.</p>
    <p>The man is said to have had nine “spir­i­tual wives” at one point.</p>
    <p>The five women, all in their 40s, are in his in­ner cir­cle and form the back­bone of the group.</p>
    <p>They help run a small restau­rant and an event man­age­ment com­pany which he owns.</p>
    <p>Two had pre­vi­ously worked for a lo­cal Malay-Mus­lim or­gan­i­sa­tion.</p>
    <p>One of them, a mother of two girls, was a se­nior ex­ec­u­tive of a char­i­ta­ble or­gan­i­sa­tion and founder of a woman’s or­gan­i­sa­tion. She has a diploma in syariah law and cer­tifi­cates in Is­lamic education and re­search.</p>
    <p>When con­tacted re­cently, the woman – called Kak Long, or el­dest sis­ter in Malay – told The Straits Times that peo­ple were spread­ing “un­truths” about the group.</p>
    <p>The group does not re­cruit openly – choos­ing only trust­wor­thy can­di­dates or fi­nan­cially in­de­pen­dent women. It is be­lieved Kak Long re­cruited the other women.</p>
    <p>An­other spir­i­tual wife, who has four chil­dren and lec­tures at a ju­nior col­lege, is a co-founder of a women’s as­so­ci­a­tion.</p>
    <p>When her for­mer hus­band con­fronted her over her in­volve­ment with the group, her “sis­ters” told her to de­fend the leader and her rights as a woman.</p>
    <p>The cou­ple di­vorced in 2017 and her for­mer hus­band died last year.</p>
    <p>An­other woman, who was a fol­lower in 2015 but has now mar­ried and moved on, said she re­gards the group as her fam­ily and will not di­vulge in­for­ma­tion that could “jeop­ar­dise” them.</p>

        <p data-role="text">Each night, the five women still in the group leave the restau&#xAD;rant in a few cars, with the man tak&#xAD;ing a ride in one of the ve&#xAD;hi&#xAD;cles to his flat in the west&#xAD;ern part of Sin&#xAD;ga&#xAD;pore.</p>
