    <p>Be­fore the pan­demic, con­sul­tant Mer­lyn Kang con­sid­ered her­self lucky if she could fit in two work­outs a week.</p>
    <p>Now with more time at home, the 26-year-old finds her­self at­tend­ing fit­ness classes al­most five times a week. And with the in­creased fre­quency, she has had to buy more work­out gear too.</p>
    <p>Since Covid-19 started, she has been shop­ping from brands such as Lu­l­ule­mon and Nike up to three times a month, pick­ing up leg­gings, sports bras and tops.</p>
    <p>“Most of my cloth­ing pur­chases dur­ing Covid-19 are activewear, com­pared with be­fore, when it might have been work­wear mostly,” she says.</p>
    <p>The pan­demic may have brought much of the fash­ion re­tail in­dus­try to its knees, but one sec­tor has seen un­par­al­leled growth: activewear. With many turn­ing to ex­er­cise – ei­ther to stave off bore­dom or stay healthy – in a global cri­sis, the need for stylish work­out wear has ac­cel­er­ated a boom in the sec­tor, which had al­ready been on the rise in re­cent years.</p>
    <p>A study from the iPrice Group con­ducted be­tween Jan­uary and June found that Google search in­ter­est in South-east Asia for sports­wear brands Nike and Adi­das soared by 605 per cent and 577 per cent re­spec­tively, com­pared with be­fore the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>In Sin­ga­pore, global sports brands re­ported sim­i­lar de­mand.</p>
    <p>Mr Nils Swolkien, man­ag­ing di­rec­tor of De­cathlon Sin­ga­pore, says the com­pany saw a “mod­est year-to-date growth in rev­enue of 3.9 per cent as com­pared to 2019”, with a “strong surge in sports like cy­cling and fit­ness” this year.</p>
    <p>And while equip­ment sales are “ex­po­nen­tially higher than the sale of our ap­parel”, De­cathlon’s house brand of activewear has been sell­ing well, he adds.</p>
    <p>“Fit­ness and jog­ging ap­parel is in our top-sell­ing list, and our yoga and jog­ging ap­parel for women has also been ex­cep­tion­ally pop­u­lar among Sin­ga­pore­ans.”</p>
    <p>The brand opened a du­plex Ex­pe­ri­ence store at The Cen­tre­point and a Click & Col­lect store in Tiong Bahru Plaza this year. Mr Swolkien adds: “We can say the busi­ness is stronger for us now than it was pre­vi­ously.”</p>
    <p>Phys­i­cal re­tail at Un­der Ar­mour suf­fered dur­ing the pan­demic, but was saved by e-com­merce, says mar­ket­ing di­rec­tor of Un­der Ar­mour South-east Asia, Ms Yvonne Tey. The US sports brand opened a store in Park­way Pa­rade last month and opens its re­freshed Or­chard Cen­tral flag­ship store to­day.</p>
    <p>Ms Tey says: “Sales via our e-com­merce plat­forms in­creased as con­sumers’ mind­set and con­sump­tion pat­terns shifted dur­ing the pan­demic, with more seek­ing dig­i­talled, at-home and low-touch ex­pe­ri­ences. Over­all, while it has been dif­fi­cult, we have also seen growth.”</p>
    <p>The boom­ing in­ter­est in work­ing out has not gone un­no­ticed here. Two home-grown ap­parel brands are cap­i­tal­is­ing on the de­mand and have launched gymwear lines.</p>
    <p>For the first time in its 45-year his­tory, B2B (busi­ness to busi­ness) uni­forms brand JML Uni­forms has de­buted a gymwear la­bel sell­ing</p>
    <p>di­rect to con­sumers. Called F Brand, the co-ed la­bel launched on­line (fbrand.com.sg) last month with a range of activewear ba­sics.</p>
    <p>The com­pany cut its teeth sup­ply­ing fash­ion ap­parel to depart­ment stores such as Ise­tan and nowde­funct chains Ori­en­tal Em­po­rium and Yao­han. It switched to mak­ing uni­forms in the 1990s.</p>
    <p>When busi­ness slowed be­cause of Covid-19, the com­pany’s di­rec­tor Jack Ou de­cided to try B2C (busi­ness to con­sumer), af­ter con­sult­ing with the SME Cen­tre at En­ter­prise Sin­ga­pore. The 37-yearold says it was not a blind leap of faith be­cause the com­pany has built up a net­work of ap­parel con­tacts over the years.</p>
    <p>Gymwear was top of mind be</p>
    <p>cause Mr Ou was in­spired af­ter read­ing news of peo­ple crowd­ing parks to ex­er­cise. See­ing a man­u­fac­tur­ing part­ner in China switch to spe­cial­is­ing in gymwear in 2015 gave him added con­fi­dence.</p>
    <p>How­ever, his mother, Madam Ng Gim Kwee, 67, who started the com­pany with Mr Ou’s fifth un­cle, needed some con­vinc­ing.</p>
    <p>“To her, it wasn’t fea­si­ble be­cause we were too used to do­ing B2B busi­ness. We man­u­fac­ture what peo­ple or­der, and not man­u­fac­ture to wait for or­ders,” he says.</p>
    <p>F Brand’s women’s range is priced from $23.80 for a sin­glet to $103.80 for quick-dry pants, while the men’s line goes from $28.80 for tees to $58.80 for run­ner pants. Since its launch, it has re­ceived just</p>
    <p>un­der 100 or­ders.</p>
    <p>With no phys­i­cal stores, it has been hard get­ting word out as cus­tomers can­not feel the prod­ucts in per­son, says Mr Ou. Many Sin­ga­pore­ans, he adds, also still pre­fer global brands like Adi­das, Nike and Lu­l­ule­mon, which boast va­ri­ety and pres­tige.</p>
    <p>Sim­i­larly, fel­low lo­cal ap­parel brand YeoMama Batik had its fair share of ob­sta­cles try­ing to brand and de­but its activewear line. The batik fash­ion la­bel, founded by Ms Desleen Yeo and her mother in Jan­uary 2018, launched, al­beit un­suc­cess­fully, a batik activewear line called Ninja in Septem­ber last year.</p>
    <p>“We didn’t re­alise how dif­fer­ent activewear was from reg­u­lar cloth­ing. We’d as­sumed YeoMama Batik</p>
    <p>fol­low­ers would also sup­port Ninja, but it turned out to be a small per­cent­age,” says Ms Yeo, 29. They also strug­gled try­ing to tar­get both the pole dancing com­mu­nity – Ms Yeo is an avid pole dancer – and the gen­eral fit­ness crowd.</p>
    <p>Covid-19 gave them the op­por­tu­nity to re­brand and relaunch.</p>
    <p>“I re­alised ev­ery­one was do­ing home work­outs, even friends who don’t usu­ally work out were buy­ing activewear,” says Ms Yeo.</p>
    <p>Re­fo­cus­ing on the fit­ness com­mu­nity, the team re­did the prod­uct photograph­y and part­nered with lo­cal yoga stu­dios to pro­mote the ap­parel. The prod­ucts Ninja first de­buted with re­main the same – bra tops ($68), leg­gings ($88) and shorts ($58). Un­like the main line, which is made from hand-stamped batik, Ninja’s pat­terns are dig­i­tally printed, as batik dyes can­not seep into ly­cra.</p>
    <p>Since re­launch­ing in end-April, prod­ucts have been mov­ing at a 60 per cent growth rate, Ms Yeo says. They started stock­ing Ninja on e-re­tailer Zalora and have been sell­ing about 20 pieces a month.</p>
    <p>She be­lieves they still have a long way to go in build­ing a re­la­tion­ship with the lo­cal fit­ness com­mu­nity, and cre­at­ing “mo­ti­va­tional con­tent” to sus­tain the brand.</p>
