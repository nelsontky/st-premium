    <p>LON­DON Arse­nal out­cast Me­sut Ozil’s fu­ture at the Premier League club could be de­cided dur­ing the Jan­uary trans­fer win­dow and the Ger­man mid­fielder will be al­lowed to leave if they re­ceive a good of­fer, man­ager Mikel Arteta said on Thurs­day.</p>
    <p>Ozil, whose con­tract at Arse­nal ends this sea­son, has not played for the Lon­don club since last March and was omit­ted from their Premier League and Europa League squads for the first half of the sea­son.</p>
    <p>The 32-year-old is free to ne­go­ti­ate with other teams this month and Bri­tish me­dia re­ported he was in talks with Turk­ish club Fener­bahce and Amer­i­can side DC United.</p>
    <p>“We will de­cide what’s hap­pen­ing in the next few days, I don’t know what is go­ing to hap­pen,” Arteta told re­porters ahead of to­day’s FA Cup third-round home game against New­cas­tle United.</p>
    <p>“We’ll dis­cuss in­ter­nally what the best so­lu­tion for him is for the near fu­ture, and try to find the best so­lu­tion for ev­ery­one.</p>
    <p>“If some­thing was sorted this month, it’s be­cause it’s good for Me­sut and his fu­ture, and it’s good for the club.</p>
    <p>“If that’s the case, we’ll move for­ward. If it’s not the case, the player will stay here.”</p>
    <p>Ozil can be named in the Premier League squad again this month – clubs can make changes to their squads af­ter the Jan­uary trans­fer win­dow.</p>
    <p>But, when Arteta was asked about the prospect of the play­maker re­turn­ing, he hinted he is un­likely to change his mind.</p>
    <p>“I had to make a de­ci­sion (at the start of the sea­son) and I made it. I knew the con­se­quences of it and now we’re go­ing to have to make an­other one in Jan­uary,” said the Spa­niard, who played along­side Ozil for three sea­sons at Arse­nal be­fore re­tir­ing in 2016.</p>
    <p>“We will just (be) putting the bal­ance on what is the best thing for the club and the best thing for the team, and we will try to find the right so­lu­tions for that.”</p>
    <p>Arteta said mid­fielder Thomas Partey would be as­sessed be­fore the game be­fore de­cid­ing whether to risk him or save him for Crys­tal Palace’s league visit next week.</p>
    <p>De­fender Gabriel, who tested pos­i­tive for Covid-19 last month, is not show­ing any signs of ill­ness but will re­turn to train­ing only af­ter med­i­cal checks.</p>
    <p>Arteta, whose side are the reign­ing FA Cup cham­pi­ons, also be</p>
    <p>lieves it is vi­tal to play a strong side in the cup com­pe­ti­tions.</p>
    <p>“We’re gonna go af­ter ev­ery com­pe­ti­tion. We are the hold­ers we have to de­fend that ti­tle,” he said.</p>
    <p>“We know what it means for the football club and the his­tory that is re­lated to the FA Cup.</p>
    <p>“It’s a great com­pe­ti­tion to play for us.”</p>
