    <p>About a third of Sin­ga­pore’s 18,000 stall­hold­ers in mar­kets and hawker cen­tres now let cus­tomers pay by scan­ning a QR code.</p>
    <p>Over the past two months, about 1,900 stall­hold­ers have come on board the na­tional uni­fied e-pay­ment so­lu­tion, dubbed Sin­ga­pore Quick Re­sponse Code (SGQR), fol­low­ing en­hanced ef­forts to pro­mote dig­i­tal pay­ments.</p>
    <p>With the new ad­di­tions, a to­tal of 5,400 stall­hold­ers can now re­ceive pay­ments from cus­tomers through 19 dig­i­tal wal­lets in­clud­ing PayLah, Dash and GrabPay.</p>
    <p>Speak­ing to the me­dia at the Lorong 8 Toa Payoh Hawker Cen­tre yes­ter­day, Com­mu­ni­ca­tions and In­for­ma­tion Min­is­ter S. Iswaran said the in­creased adop­tion of e-pay­ments was part of a larger mind­set shift to­wards dig­i­tal­i­sa­tion.</p>
    <p>“The mes­sage of dig­i­tal­i­sa­tion is one that has been prop­a­gated for some time now, well be­fore the on­set of Covid-19,” he said. “What Covid-19 has done is to ac­cen­tu­ate the means and the im­pe­tus of dig­i­tal­i­sa­tion... For many busi­nesses, dig­i­tal tran­si­tion has now be­come a mat­ter of ne­ces­sity and, I would say, sur­vival – whether it is be­ing able to sell on­line, take pay­ments on­line (or) link up with lo­gis­tics com­pa­nies for last-mile so­lu­tions.”</p>
    <p>The re­cent in­crease was spurred by the Govern­ment’s Hawk­ers Go Dig­i­tal scheme, launched in June.</p>
    <p>Un­der the scheme, hawk­ers who sign up for SGQR get a bonus of $300 a month over five months if they have at least 20 cash­less trans­ac­tions in each of these five months. The goal is to have all 18,000 stall­hold­ers use SGQR by the mid­dle of next year.</p>
    <p>More than 2,000 stall­hold­ers have re­ceived the bonus to date, the In­fo­comm Me­dia De­vel­op­ment Au­thor­ity (IMDA) and En­ter­prise Sin­ga­pore (ESG) said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Hawker Hu Xiu Zhen, 50, who owns Yong Xing Eco­nomic Bee Hoon in Lorong 8 Toa Payoh Hawker Cen­tre, recorded 257 cash­less trans­ac­tions last month.</p>
    <p>Madam Hu, who adopted the SGQR pay­ment so­lu­tion in Au­gust last year, said cash­less trans­ac­tions at her stall have risen to about four a day, from one ev­ery few days last year. “It’s more con­ve­nient for us be­cause we don’t need to get change when peo­ple buy from us,” she said, not­ing that her cus­tomers are al­ready fa­mil­iar with scan­ning a QR code for pay­ment.</p>
    <p>Madam Jorene Chua, 55, who runs 888 Tau Kwa in the neigh­bour­ing mar­ket, said: “Cus­tomers who use cash are still in the ma­jor­ity, but there has been a def­i­nite in­crease in the past few months, mostly among younger peo­ple.”</p>
    <p>To help busi­nesses and se­niors over­come the dis­rup­tion brought about by the Covid-19 pan­demic, the IMDA set up the SG Dig­i­tal Of­fice (SDO) in May.</p>
    <p>Dig­i­tal am­bas­sadors un­der SDO have reached out to a to­tal of 15,900 stall­hold­ers in the past two months. Plans are also un­der way to have dig­i­tal am­bas­sadors teach se­niors at com­mu­nity hubs how to use their smart­phones and pick up use­ful daily dig­i­tal skills, such as us­ing What­sApp and SingPass mo­bile as well as mak­ing e-pay­ments.</p>
