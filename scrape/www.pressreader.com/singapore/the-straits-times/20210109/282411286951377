    <p>Wall Street op­ti­mism af­ter Mr Joe Bi­den was con­firmed as the next United States pres­i­dent sent lo­cal shares soar­ing yes­ter­day in line with ma­jor gains across the re­gion.</p>
    <p>The Straits Times Index (STI) shot up 86.22 points or 2.97 per cent to 2,993.19, tak­ing it close to the psy­cho­log­i­cal sup­port of 3,000 once again. In­vestors are hop­ing that Mr Bi­den’s con­fir­ma­tion will mean more stim­u­lus spend­ing to help the US econ­omy over­come its pan­demic-in­duced down­turn.</p>
    <p>Ja­pan’s Nikkei 225 gained 2.36 per cent, Malaysian stocks added 1.89 per cent and the Hang Seng Index in Hong Kong gained 1.2 per cent. Only the Shang­hai Com­pos­ite Index re­treated, fall­ing 0.17 per cent.</p>
    <p>An­other rea­son for the STI’s surge could be re­lated to its heavy com­po­si­tion of fi­nan­cial stocks.</p>
    <p>The STI has risen 5.3 per cent this week. Around 2.55 bil­lion shares worth $2.13 bil­lion changed hands yes­ter­day, with gain­ers out­num­ber­ing losers 321 to 202.</p>
    <p>Top index per­former DBS added 5.26 per cent to $27.42 – near its last peak of $27.50 in March 2018 – amid a bank­ing stock rally.</p>
    <p>City De­vel­op­ments was the worst per­former and the only de­cliner, ex­tend­ing its week-long losses as it fell 2.65 per cent to $7.35 over board­room de­par­tures. This was de­spite ex­ec­u­tive chair­man Kwek Leng Beng’s at­tempt to de­fend re­cent ap­point­ments to the board.</p>
    <p>Axi chief global mar­ket strate­gist Stephen Innes said mon­e­tary stim­u­lus as well as high sav­ings rates have cre­ated the per­fect con­di­tions for spec­u­la­tion and as­set price lift-off.</p>
    <p>“And when adding the ben­e­fit that in­vestors will no longer be held hostage to the pre­vi­ous White House con­fu­sion on pol­icy, it is no won­der the Street is still pop­ping the New Year cham­pagne, bask­ing in the af­ter­glow of the rally party, which is look­ing to ex­tend.”</p>
