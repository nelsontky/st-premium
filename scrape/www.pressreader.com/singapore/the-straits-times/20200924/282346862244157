    <p>• Bos­nian ten­nis player Damir Dzumhur is tak­ing le­gal ac­tion against the or­gan­is­ers of the French Open af­ter he was barred from en­ter­ing the qual­i­fi­ca­tion round fol­low­ing a pos­i­tive Covid-19 test for his coach Pe­tar Popovic.</p>
    <p>The Serb said the test was a “false pos­i­tive” be­cause he had al­ready been in­fected ear­lier this year and was “full of an­ti­bod­ies”.</p>
    <p>He also in­sisted a new pri­vate test he un­der­went in Ser­bia showed he was neg­a­tive, French sports daily L’Equipe re­ported.</p>
    <p>World No. 114 Dzumhur, who at his high­est was ranked 23rd, and Popovic have both claimed they were de­nied a sec­ond test by the French Ten­nis Fed­er­a­tion (FFT), the or­gan­is­ers of the Grand Slam, thus forc­ing their le­gal ac­tion.</p>
    <p>“It’s a scan­dal and a huge frus­tra­tion,” Popovic told L’Equipe on Tues­day. “I’m sure we’re go­ing to win in court. They’re go­ing to pay a lot for this. It makes me crazy.</p>
    <p>“If he had been called (de­fend­ing cham­pion) Rafael Nadal, for cer­tain they would have taken a sec</p>
    <p>ond sam­ple, even a third, to be sure that it wasn’t a false re­sult. I want it to be a bit more hu­man.”</p>
    <p>Popovic also told the As­so­ci­ated Press that Dzumhur had tested neg­a­tive, but was ex­cluded be­cause they had shared a room.</p>
    <p>The FFT has, how­ever, in­sisted that the guide­lines had been agreed upon by the play­ers, with the as­so­ci­a­tion’s doc­tor, Bernard Mon­tal­van, adding that Popovic “had been tested twice”.</p>
    <p>“We have drawn up our pro­to­col in con­sul­ta­tion with the government ser­vices. It was signed by the play­ers and their team to ob­tain their ac­cred­i­ta­tion,” it said in a state­ment to Reuters.</p>
    <p>Dr Mon­tal­van also told L’Equipe: “If a coach sleeps in the same room as his player, he knows that if he tests pos­i­tive, the player will be a con­tact case. That is why it’s writ­ten in the pro­to­col that it’s not rec­om­mended to share a room.”</p>
    <p>The de­layed French Open will be held from Sun­day to Oct 11 af­ter be­ing moved from its usual late MayJune slot. And there are plans to al­low up to 5,000 fans at Roland Gar­ros, mak­ing the Grand Slam the first tour­na­ment to have a crowd since both the men’s and women’s ten­nis tours were put on ice in March for five months.</p>
