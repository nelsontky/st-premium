    <p>Kiss92 DJ Maddy Barber was touched when a truck driver who had ac­ci­den­tally sideswiped her parked car and knocked off its side mir­ror waited in the rain and of­fered to com­pen­sate her for the dam­ages.</p>
    <p>Moved by Mr Wang Yaowen’s hon­esty in last month’s in­ci­dent, she de­cided to rope in the Kiss92 team and the sta­tion’s lis­ten­ers to re­ward him for his good deed.</p>
    <p>On Tues­day, Mr Wang met the Kiss92 team and a fan who will be spon­sor­ing air tick­ets for the truck driver’s fam­ily in China to visit him in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>Through­out last month, the Kiss92 team ran a “trade-up project” on air which saw Ms Barber’s bro­ken side mir­ror traded in for items of a higher value, such as a teak­wood desk set worth over $450.</p>
    <p>This was in turn traded in for items such as four gam­ing chairs and a queen-sized mat­tress, with the DJs also of­fer­ing to swop their own de­signer watches and sun­glasses.</p>
    <p>The chal­lenge cul­mi­nated in one lis­tener, who wanted to be known only as Mr Chia, of­fer­ing to buy air tick­ets for Mr Wang’s wife and two chil­dren be­cause he felt the items traded in were not re­ally use­ful to the mi­grant worker. “He misses his fam­ily so much so I thought a fam­ily visit for him would be good,” Mr Chia, who is a caterer, told Kiss92.</p>
    <p>Ms Barber, DJ Di­vian Nair and pre­sen­ter and ex­ec­u­tive pro­ducer An­dre Hoe­den were also present at Tues­day’s meet­ing with Mr Wang, and there were “smiles and tears all around”, said Kiss92.</p>
    <p>The Kiss92 team said Pu­tien, a home-grown res­tau­rant chain that serves Fu­jian-style cui­sine, will be host­ing a free meal for Mr Wang and his fam­ily. Parkroyal Col­lec­tion Pick­er­ing will also spon­sor a 4D3N stay for his fam­ily when they visit him here.</p>
