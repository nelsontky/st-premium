    <p>LON­DON • Eng­land man­ager Gareth South­gate is hop­ing that Harry Kane will be fit to start in the Na­tions League clash with Den­mark to­day, but could pos­si­bly in­cur the wrath of Jose Mour­inho if he de­cides to play the striker.</p>
    <p>Tot­ten­ham boss Mour­inho had called on South­gate not to risk play­ing the 27-year-old Eng­land cap­tain in all three games dur­ing this in­ter­na­tional break, with Spurs hav­ing had a con­gested start to the new sea­son.</p>
    <p>Kane im­pressed with two goals as he helped Tot­ten­ham thrash Manch­ester United 6-1 in the Premier League ear­lier this month. He sub­se­quently suf­fered a thigh is­sue and was not in­volved in a friendly with Wales last Thurs­day, and came off the bench in the 66th minute against Bel­gium on Sun­day.</p>
    <p>South­gate is con­fi­dent that Kane would be “good to start” against the Danes de­spite Mour­inho’s con­cerns.</p>
    <p>“Well, med­i­cally, there’s been con­ver­sa­tions, be­cause that would al­ways be the case,” the Eng­land boss told re­porters when asked if the Three Lions had been in con­tact with Spurs. “He started to train on Wed­nes­day, was a lit­tle un­happy with how he felt, so worked with our med­i­cal team the next cou­ple of days. We scanned just to be cer­tain but it’s a mus­cu­lar fa­tigue is­sue rather than an in­jury... He knew by then he could push on a lit­tle bit, but he just needed a bit more con­fi­dence in it.</p>
    <p>“I think he’ll have gained more con­fi­dence from the spell he had against Bel­gium, and so all be­ing well, we hope he’ll be good to start on Wed­nes­day.”</p>
    <p>Mour­inho’s wor­ries are not un­jus­ti­fied, given Spurs’ reliance on their star for­ward.</p>
    <p>Kane missed nine matches in the Premier League last sea­son and, of those matches, Tot­ten­ham won only three – scor­ing 12 goals com­pared to 49 goals and 13 vic­to­ries with Kane in the team.</p>
    <p>The striker al­ready has three goals and six as­sists in four ap­pear­ances this cam­paign.</p>
    <p>Tot­ten­ham next play on Sun­day, with Mour­inho’s men host­ing Lon­don ri­vals West Ham.</p>
    <p>If Kane misses out to­day, in-form Ever­ton striker Do­minic Calvert-Lewin, who scored the opener against Wales, should re­tain his spot in the side.</p>
    <p>Winger Jadon San­cho and striker Tammy Abra­ham are in line to re­turn af­ter miss­ing Thurs­day’s game due to a breach of coro­n­avirus reg­u­la­tions.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, de­fend­ers Ben Chilwell and Kieran Trip­pier have with­drawn from the squad, the team an­nounced yesterday.</p>
    <p>The rea­sons for their with­drawal were not spec­i­fied but Sky Sports re­ported Chilwell re­turned to Chelsea due to a pre-ex­ist­ing foot in­jury while Trip­pier left the camp for per­sonal rea­sons.</p>
    <p>The with­drawals leave South­gate with 28 play­ers to choose from for his 23-man squad for to­day’s game.</p>
    <p>Eng­land are top of Na­tions League Group A2 with seven points af­ter three games, one point ahead of sec­ond-placed Bel­gium.</p>
