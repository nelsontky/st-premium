    <p>As Sin­ga­pore and China en­ter their fourth decade of co­op­er­a­tion, the most im­me­di­ate task for both coun­tries is to work on strength­en­ing epi­demic preven­tion and con­trol, said Deputy Prime Min­is­ter Heng Swee Keat.</p>
    <p>In an in­ter­view with Chi­nese daily Lianhe Zaobao pub­lished yes­ter­day, he added that there is room for both coun­tries to col­lab­o­rate in other ar­eas, in­clud­ing up­hold­ing a rules-based mul­ti­lat­eral trad­ing sys­tem, man­ag­ing an age­ing pop­u­la­tion, fi­nance and tech­nol­ogy.</p>
    <p>“Right now, our main task is to con­trol the pan­demic,” Mr Heng said. “If we can con­trol the pan­demic, eco­nomic and so­cial ac­tiv­i­ties will be able to grad­u­ally re­sume. So this is the most crit­i­cal thing now.”</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore and China are com­mem­o­rat­ing 30 years of for­mal ties this year. In Au­gust, Bei­jing’s most se­nior diplo­mat, Mr Yang Jiechi, vis­ited Sin­ga­pore and called on lead­ers here, in­clud­ing Prime Min­is­ter Lee Hsien Loong.</p>
    <p>On Thurs­day, which marked the 71st an­niver­sary of the found­ing of the Peo­ple’s Re­pub­lic of China, Pres­i­dent Hal­imah Ya­cob and PM Lee wrote letters to con­grat­u­late China on the oc­ca­sion.</p>
    <p>In the in­ter­view, Mr Heng also out­lined other ar­eas of po­ten­tial co­op­er­a­tion, in­clud­ing in fi­nance.</p>
    <p>The les­son learnt from the Asian fi­nan­cial cri­sis and the 2008 global fi­nan­cial cri­sis was that fi­nance is vi­tal for eco­nomic sta­bil­ity and growth, Mr Heng said.</p>
    <p>Many Asian coun­tries have sub­stan­tial sav­ings, and it is worth study­ing how this money can go to­wards sus­tain­able de­vel­op­ment projects, he added.</p>
    <p>He gave the ex­am­ple of in­fras­truc­ture projects un­der China’s Belt and Road Ini­tia­tive, not­ing that Asia needs US$1.7 tril­lion (S$2.3 tril­lion) in in­fras­truc­ture de­vel­op­ment each year.</p>
    <p>The Asian De­vel­op­ment Bank (ADB) has said Asia will need to in­vest US$1.7 tril­lion per year in in­fras­truc­ture un­til 2030 to main­tain its growth mo­men­tum, tackle poverty, and re­spond to cli­mate change.</p>
    <p>But there are risks if projects are not suit­able or if the fi­nan­cial sys­tem is not strong, Mr Heng said.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore and China, along with mul­ti­lat­eral or­gan­i­sa­tions such as the World Bank, the ADB, and China’s Asian In­fras­truc­ture In­vest­ment Bank, can work to­gether to train of­fi­cials and co­op­er­ate with of­fi­cials, bankers and in­vestors to de­sign a bet­ter plat­form for the flow of funds.</p>
    <p>Mr Heng also touched on the po­ten­tial for Sin­ga­pore to work with China to grow its po­si­tion as an off­shore trad­ing hub for the Chi­nese ren­minbi, and stressed that in­no­va­tion and tech­nol­ogy will play a more im­por­tant role in the fu­ture.</p>
    <p>He praised the en­trepreneur­ial spirit that he wit­nessed in China as well.</p>
    <p>The Deputy Prime Min­is­ter re­counted a visit he made to the city of Wen­zhou in Zhe­jiang prov­ince, which has a rep­u­ta­tion for en­trepreneur­ship. There, in a small show­room, he saw thou­sands of beau­ti­ful watches of many dif­fer­ent brands.</p>
    <p>The show­room, he later found out, was a col­lab­o­ra­tive ef­fort by en­ter­prises which were will­ing to co­op­er­ate with their com­peti­tors in or­der to build a com­mon plat­form and bet­ter serve buy­ers.</p>
    <p>“I hope our busi­nesses will be able to learn from this spirit,” Mr Heng said. “Although busi­nesses may be in com­pe­ti­tion with one an­other, they may face com­mon prob­lems. Busi­nesses must think about how they can co­op­er­ate to solve these com­mon prob­lems, and then think about how to dif­fer­en­ti­ate their prod­ucts.”</p>
    <p>Lianhe Zaobao and ThinkChina – an on­line mag­a­zine by the news­pa­per – have also pub­lished a new photo book to com­mem­o­rate 30 years of Sino-Sin­ga­pore ties.</p>
    <p>The book, ti­tled In the Founders’ Foot­steps: 30 Years Of Sin­ga­poreChina Diplo­matic Re­la­tions, con­tains rare photos cel­e­brat­ing the links be­tween both coun­tries, such as para­mount leader Deng Xiaop­ing’s visit to Sin­ga­pore in 1978 and found­ing prime min­is­ter Lee Kuan Yew’s many trips to China.</p>
    <p>The Sin­ga­pore-China re­la­tion­ship was never go­ing to be an easy one given the huge dif­fer­ences be­tween the two coun­tries, not the least of which are their dif­fer­ent po­lit­i­cal sys­tems and dis­par­ity in size.</p>
    <p>An­other com­pli­cat­ing fac­tor: Sin­ga­pore’s eth­nic Chi­nese ma­jor­ity pop­u­la­tion (75 per cent), with many Sin­ga­pore­ans still steeped in Chi­nese cus­toms and tra­di­tions, and for some, even per­sonal mem­o­ries of the moth­er­land.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore’s eth­nic mix, es­pe­cially set against the com­plex­i­ties and racial sen­si­tiv­i­ties of its South-east Asian neigh­bour­hood, ex­plains why in 1990, it be­came the last of the orig­i­nal six Asean mem­ber states to es­tab­lish diplo­matic ties with</p>
    <p>China even though in­for­mal ties had been on­go­ing for more than 10 years prior to that.</p>
    <p>As the only eth­nic Chi­nese-ma­jor­ity state in South-east Asia (in­deed the world), Sin­ga­pore did not want to be seen in the re­gion as a fifth col­umn of China. The mat­ter was par­tic­u­larly acute in the 1970s, when China was ac­tively cham­pi­oning the com­mu­nist cause and lend­ing sup­port to South-east Asia’s left­ists, pos­ing se­cu­rity wor­ries for the re­gion’s gov­ern­ments, in­clud­ing Sin­ga­pore’s.</p>
    <p>Only when these were re­solved, did Sin­ga­pore feel ready to es­tab­lish diplo­matic ties and, in 1990, the time was right.</p>
    <p>As the late found­ing prime min­is­ter Lee Kuan Yew wrote in his mem­oirs: “Un­like in 1976, I was no longer con­cerned that a Chi­nese em­bassy in Sin­ga­pore could pose prob­lems for our se­cu­rity. Our do­mes­tic con­di­tions had changed. We had solved some ba­sic prob­lems in Chi­nese education.”</p>
    <p>Yet an­other com­pli­cat­ing fac­tor: Sin­ga­pore troops train­ing in Tai­wan, which China con­sid­ers a break­away prov­ince. The Chi­nese had ini­tially wanted an end date to this ar­range­ment prior to set­ting up for­mal ties.</p>
    <p>Am­bas­sador-at-large Tommy Koh, who led a del­e­ga­tion in 1990 to Bei­jing to ne­go­ti­ate the es­tab­lish­ment of ties, re­calls in an e-mail in­ter­view that Sin­ga­pore had a num­ber of non-ne­go­tiable con­di­tions re­lated to Tai­wan, in­clud­ing the right to send its na­tional ser­vice­men for train­ing to Tai­wan and the right of its lead­ers to visit Tai­wan in their in­di­vid­ual and pri­vate ca­pac­i­ties.</p>
    <p>In the end, Bei­jing opted for flex­i­bil­ity over Tai­wan in or­der to clear the path­way for for­mal ties.</p>
    <p>The last 30 years since have seen the re­la­tion­ship grow stronger and closer, al­beit punc­tu­ated by blips and dips, par­tic­u­larly in 2004 and 2016.</p>
    <p>It is a jour­ney that, in the words of Mr Xu Lip­ing of the Chi­nese Academy of So­cial Sciences, “has been very dif­fi­cult and full of twists and turns”. But on bal­ance it has been a pos­i­tive one, he adds.</p>
    <p>MU­TUAL BEN­E­FIT</p>
    <p>When China first be­gan to re­form its econ­omy in 1978 and to open up to the world, Sin­ga­pore played a very im­por­tant and unique role, par­tic­u­larly as a bridge be­tween China and the West, Mr Xu notes.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore helped China to in­te­grate into the re­gional and in­ter­na­tional eco­nomic sys­tems. It pushed for China’s en­try to the World Trade Or­gan­i­sa­tion, which took place in 2001, and pro­moted China-Asean co­op­er­a­tion, with the 2002 China-Asean free trade agree­ment be­ing one of its out­comes.</p>
    <p>But bi­lat­eral ties went be­yond that, grow­ing deeper and broader, with both sides dis­play­ing a prag­ma­tism that over­came the dif­fer­ences.</p>
    <p>In eco­nom­ics, the two sides cre­ated demon­stra­tion projects such as the Suzhou In­dus­trial Park that be­gan in 1994 and the Tian­jin Eco-City (launched in 2007) that lever­aged on Sin­ga­pore’s ex­pe­ri­ence and ex­per­tise.</p>
    <p>China also sought to glean lessons in state gov­er­nance, city ad­min­is­tra­tion and po­lit­i­cal party man­age­ment. It sent many of its of­fi­cials, both from cen­tral and lo­cal gov­ern­ments, to train at var­i­ous in­sti­tu­tions in Sin­ga­pore, in­clud­ing the Nanyang Tech­no­log­i­cal Univer­sity and the Lee Kuan Yew School of Pub­lic Pol­icy at the Na­tional Univer­sity of Sin­ga­pore. These ex­changes be­gan in the 1980s but bur­geoned from 1992, when then pa­tri­arch Deng Xiaop­ing told his peo­ple to learn from Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>There were the oc­ca­sional hic­cups, such as when the Suzhou In­dus­trial Park project ran into dif­fi­cul­ties be­cause of a di­ver­gence of ob­jec­tives be­tween China’s cen­tral and lo­cal gov­ern­ments.</p>
    <p>Still, as Pro­fes­sor Koh notes, by 2004, Sin­ga­pore and China “had very sub­stan­tive ties in trade, in­vest­ment, tourism, pol­i­tics, the trans­mis­sion of knowl­edge, ex­per­tise and best prac­tices from Sin­ga­pore to China”.</p>
    <p>DIPS IN TIES</p>
    <p>But 2004 was the year that Sin­ga­pore and China were to ex­pe­ri­ence a ma­jor dip in their re­la­tions. That was when then Deputy Prime Min­is­ter Lee Hsien Loong paid a visit to Tai­wan, weeks ahead of his be­com­ing Prime Min­is­ter. Be­fore his Tai­wan trip, in July, Mr Lee had vis­ited Bei­jing in May, and had been given the red-car­pet treat­ment.</p>
    <p>The Chi­nese re­acted an­grily to Mr Lee’s Tai­wan trip, say­ing it hurt their core in­ter­ests and warn­ing that the “Singaporea­n side should take full re­spon­si­bil­ity for re­sults from the event”.</p>
    <p>While Sin­ga­pore ex­plained that the visit was a pri­vate one and did not change its “one China” pol­icy, the Chi­nese con­tended that as Mr Lee had held se­nior po­si­tions in the gov­ern­ment for many years, his ca­pac­ity could not be changed by “a sim­ple re­mark”.</p>
    <p>Bei­jing went on to freeze of­fi­cial re­la­tions for about a year.</p>
    <p>As Prof Koh sees it, Mr Lee’s visit was in keep­ing with the agree­ment the two sides signed in 1990. He re­calls that Sin­ga­pore kept calm but made no con­ces­sions over Tai­wan. “About a year later, China de­cided to un­freeze our re­la­tions,” he says.</p>
    <p>The les­son from this episode, he says, is that while for Sin­ga­pore in­ter­na­tional treaties are sacro­sanct and must be hon­oured no mat­ter how much time has passed since they were con­cluded, for the Chi­nese, they must be in­ter­preted in the light of chang­ing cir­cum­stances. Mr Xu says that to Bei­jing, Sin­ga­pore had crossed a red line, which was that there should not be of­fi­cial con­tact be­tween the two sides.</p>
    <p>The next low point came in Novem­ber 2016, with Hong Kong im­pound­ing nine Ter­rex ar­moured ve­hi­cles be­long­ing to the Sin­ga­pore Armed Forces that had been used in troop train­ing in Tai­wan and were be­ing sent back to Sin­ga­pore on a ship that made port calls at Xi­a­men and Hong Kong.</p>
    <p>Os­ten­si­bly, the rea­son was China’s op­po­si­tion to any form of of­fi­cial in­ter­ac­tion be­tween Sin­ga­pore and Tai­wan, in­clud­ing mil­i­tary ex­changes.</p>
    <p>How­ever, the real rea­son, says Mr Xu, was that Sin­ga­pore had touched on China’s bot­tom line through its sup­port for the rul­ing of the ar­bi­tral tri­bunal on the South China Sea dis­pute be­tween China and the Philip­pines, which re­jected China’s his­tor­i­cal claims to much of the wa­ter­way. Sin­ga­pore had taken a neu­tral stand on the rul­ing but urged peace­ful res­o­lu­tion of dis­putes in ac­cor­dance with in­ter­na­tional law. PM Lee, speak­ing in Wash­ing­ton in Au­gust, said the rul­ing was much bet­ter than see­ing “whose guns are more pow­er­ful”.</p>
    <p>Again, notes Prof Koh, Sin­ga­pore stayed calm, stood firm and waited for the Chi­nese to stop their un­friendly ac­tions, which also in­cluded not invit­ing Prime Min­is­ter Lee to the in­au­gu­ral in­ter­na­tional fo­rum of the Belt and Road Ini­tia­tive in 2017.</p>
    <p>LOOK­ING TO THE FU­TURE</p>
    <p>The rough spots in ties are at­trib­ut­able in part to the high ex­pec­ta­tion each side has of the other, given the close­ness of the re­la­tion­ship and, on the part of the Chi­nese, the sense that Sin­ga­pore with its largely Chi­nese so­ci­ety should be weigh­ing in on the side of China on in­ter­na­tional is­sues.</p>
    <p>There is also the mat­ter of size. “The re­la­tion­ship be­tween Sin­ga­pore and China is not a re­la­tion­ship be­tween two equals,” says Prof Koh, adding that it is a re­la­tion­ship be­tween a big coun­try and a small coun­try, with big coun­tries hav­ing the ten­dency to bully small ones.</p>
    <p>The re­la­tion­ship has sur­vived the un­happy in­ci­dents and thrived in the past 30 years. In that time, Sin­ga­pore’s spe­cial sta­tus as a bridge be­tween China and the West has di­min­ished as China has es­tab­lished its own links and has grown strong and pow­er­ful.</p>
    <p>Still, as China’s tech gi­ants such as Ten­cent and Alibaba’s grow­ing pres­ence in Sin­ga­pore has shown, Sin­ga­pore still has a role to play in China’s eco­nomic de­vel­op­ment. In this in­stance, it is as a stag­ing board for Chi­nese com­pa­nies to ex­pand to South-east Asia and be­yond.</p>
    <p>The eco­nomic links are strong, with China now Sin­ga­pore’s largest trad­ing part­ner and Sin­ga­pore the largest in­vestor in China. Peo­ple-to-peo­ple ex­changes are also strong, par­tic­u­larly with many new Chi­nese mi­grants to Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>The re­la­tion­ship may have be­come less spe­cial, more nor­mal, but it is no less close or sub­stan­tive.</p>
    <p>The fu­ture is less cer­tain, how­ever, par­tic­u­larly with ten­sions ris­ing be­tween China and the United States. Sin­ga­pore has good re­la­tions with both and it would be dif­fi­cult for it to choose sides. How it man­ages this chal­lenge would de­ter­mine the next chap­ter of its re­la­tion­ship with China.</p>
