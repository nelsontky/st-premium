    <p>In­done­sian po­lice said yes­ter­day that they have ar­rested sus­pected Je­maah Is­lamiah (JI) leader Zulka­r­naen, the man said to be be­hind the 2002 Bali bomb­ing.</p>
    <p>Zulka­r­naen, whose real name is Aris Su­mar­sono, is an Afghan-trained mil­i­tant who is be­lieved to have led the elite squad in­volved in the sui­cide bomb­ing at Jakarta’s JW Mar­riott Ho­tel in 2003 that killed 12 peo­ple.</p>
    <p>The 57-year-old is also sus­pected to have made the bombs that killed 202 peo­ple in Bali in 2002.</p>
    <p>He had been on the run since the Jakarta bomb­ing.</p>
    <p>The po­lice said he was ar­rested “with­out re­sis­tance” late last Thurs­day in Pur­bol­inggo district in East Lam­pung re­gency, Lam­pung prov­ince, on Su­ma­tra is­land. His house was also raided.</p>
    <p>Zulka­r­naen acted as the com­man­der of the JI re­gional ter­ror net­work, and set up a squad of fight­ers known as Laskar Khos who were in­volved in the Bali bomb­ing, said the po­lice.</p>
    <p>This squad was al­legedly also re­spon­si­ble for the sec­tar­ian vi­o­lence con­flicts in Poso in Cen­tral Su­lawesi, and Am­bon in Maluku.</p>
    <p>Zulka­r­naen led mil­i­tary in­tel­li­gence op­er­a­tions for the JI.</p>
    <p>Along with Umar Patek, a field com­man­der in the 2002 Bali bomb­ing, he man­aged to regroup their fol­low­ers quickly when­ever a key as­so­ci­ate was caught or killed.</p>
    <p>Zulka­r­naen was also re­port­edly an Al-Qaeda point­man in South­east Asia. He be­came op­er­a­tions chief for JI af­ter the ar­rest of his al­leged pre­de­ces­sor En­cep Nur­ja­man, also known as Ham­bali, in Thai­land in 2003.</p>
    <p>Zulka­r­naen’s ar­rest comes af­ter the po­lice’s anti-ter­ror­ism squad Den­sus 88 ar­rested an­other ter­ror­ist, Tau­fik Bu­laga, or Upik Lawanga, in Lam­pung late last month. Tau­fik was an ex­pe­ri­enced bomb-maker and a close as­so­ci­ate of dead JI com­man­der No­ordin Top.</p>
    <p>The po­lice said that Zulka­r­naen had helped Tau­fik to lie low.</p>
    <p>The po­lice stepped up their anti-ter­ror­ism work fol­low­ing a re­cent at­tack in Cen­tral Su­lawesi.</p>
    <p>On Nov 27, four mem­bers of a Chris­tian fam­ily in Lem­ban Ton­goa, a re­mote vil­lage in Cen­tral Su­lawesi, were killed, with two of them be­headed. And vil­lagers’ homes, in­clud­ing those used for mass prayers, were torched.</p>
    <p>The 11-mem­ber East­ern In­done­sia Mu­jahideen (MIT) group, led by ter­ror­ist ring­leader Ali Kalora, was sus­pected to be be­hind the killings.</p>
    <p>MIT mil­i­tants pledge al­le­giance to the Is­lamic State in Iraq and Syria, and the group’s for­mer leader San­toso was once In­done­sia’s most-wanted ter­ror­ist. He was killed in July 2016, fol­low­ing a mas­sive man­hunt.</p>
