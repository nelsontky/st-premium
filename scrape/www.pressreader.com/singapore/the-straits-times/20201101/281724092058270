    <p>Ms Deepika Shan­muga Sun­daram, who is study­ing in France, has started car­ry­ing her pass­port and res­i­dency doc­u­ments ev­ery­where, even for short trips to the gro­cery store.</p>
    <p>The 20-year-old, a po­lit­i­cal science stu­dent at the Men­ton cam­pus of Sci­ences Po Paris, said she started to do so as the wors­en­ing Covid-19 sit­u­a­tion in France has brought racial and re­li­gious ten­sions to the fore.</p>
    <p>“Be­cause Men­ton sits on the bor­der be­tween France and Italy, the Covid-19 sit­u­a­tion has made res­i­dents more wary of refugees who are sus­pected of car­ry­ing the virus,” she added.</p>
    <p>She said a friend, a Pak­istani Amer­i­can who did not have his pass­port on hand, had been stopped and al­most de­tained near the train sta­tion in Ven­timiglia, Italy, one stop away from Men­ton.</p>
    <p>“It’s harder for per­sons of colour like my­self,” said the In­dian Sin­ga­porean.</p>
    <p>It has not helped that as France en­tered its sec­ond lock­down on Fri­day, there was a knife at­tack which saw one woman be­headed and two killed at the Notre Dame church in Nice. A 21-year-old Tu­nisian na­tional is said to have com­mit­ted the crime.</p>
    <p>With Nice only about 40 min­utes by train from where she lives, Ms Deepika said: “The fact that I was near, and I’ve walked past the church... is ter­ri­fy­ing.”</p>
