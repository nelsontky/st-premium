    <p>BERLIN • The for­eign min­is­ters of Is­rael and the United Arab Emi­rates vis­ited the Holo­caust Me­mo­rial in Berlin on Tues­day dur­ing their his­toric first meet­ing, a ma­jor step for­ward for their new re­la­tions.</p>
    <p>Is­rael’s Mr Gabi Ashke­nazi and his UAE coun­ter­part, Sheikh Ab­dul­lah bin Zayed al-Nahyan, bumped el­bows in line with mea­sures to halt the spread of the coro­n­avirus.</p>
    <p>It was their first face-to-face meet­ing since their coun­tries set aside decades of en­mity and signed a United States-bro­kered deal last month to nor­malise ties.</p>
    <p>Ac­com­pa­nied by host Ger­man For­eign Min­is­ter Heiko Maas, Mr Ashke­nazi said the visit was par­tic­u­larly mov­ing for him “as a rep­re­sen­ta­tive (of Is­rael), as a for­mer gen­eral and as the son of a Holo­caust sur­vivor”.</p>
    <p>He added: “The three of us stood there silently to­gether as we re­mem­bered the vic­tims. And, for the first time in his­tory, a rep­re­sen­ta­tive of an Arab state was present... Our pres­ence to­gether to­day sym­bol­ises a new era – of peace, sta­bil­ity, pros­per­ity and hope.”</p>
    <p>Bahrain and the UAE be­came the first Arab na­tions to es­tab­lish re­la­tions with Is­rael since Egypt in 1979 and Jor­dan in 1994.</p>
    <p>For the Mid­dle East, the deals dubbed the Abra­ham Ac­cords mark a dis­tinct shift in the sta­tus quo where Arab coun­tries have tried to main­tain unity against Is­rael over its treat­ment of the state­less Pales­tini­ans.</p>
    <p>The visit by the Emi­rati min­is­ter to the Holo­caust Me­mo­rial is also a highly sym­bolic step, mark­ing the shift in at­ti­tudes in the Arab world to­wards Is­rael and Jews.</p>
    <p>Po­lit­i­cal con­flicts have l ed to fierce ten­sions be­tween Is­lam and Ju­daism, and Holo­caust de­nial is ram­pant in many Arab coun­tries.</p>
    <p>To­gether with Mr Maas, the pair walked through the som­bre mon­u­ment, a vast un­du­lat­ing labyrinth of more than 2,700 grey con­crete blocks spread over an area equiv­a­lent to three foot­ball fields.</p>
    <p>It com­mem­o­rates the killing of six mil­lion Jews by Adolf Hitler’s Nazi regime.</p>
    <p>Vis­i­bly re­laxed, Mr Ashke­nazi and Sheikh Ab­dul­lah shared a few words as they vis­ited the mon­u­ment’s un­der­ground mu­seum and signed the vis­i­tors’ book.</p>
    <p>Sheikh Ab­dul­lah wrote “never again” in his mes­sage, adding that the site “show­cases the val­ues of co­ex­is­tence and for­give­ness... that my coun­try was built on”.</p>
    <p>Mr Ashke­nazi looked for­ward in his mes­sage, say­ing the meet­ing “sym­bol­ises the be­gin­ning of a new era. An era of peace be­tween peo­ples”.</p>
    <p>He added: “Our joint sig­na­ture in the book of re­mem­brance is like a shared cry and oath: To re­mem­ber and not to for­get, to be strong and to prom­ise ‘never again’.”</p>
    <p>Mr Maas called it “a great hon­our that the Is­raeli and Emi­rati for­eign min­is­ters picked Berlin as the site for their his­toric first meet­ing”.</p>
    <p>He said: “The most im­por­tant cur­rency in diplo­macy is trust, and I am per­son­ally thank­ful to both my col­leagues that they are plac­ing this trust in Ger­many.”</p>
    <p>Fol­low­ing their talks at the Ger­man for­eign min­istry re­treat, the UAE and Is­raeli min­is­ters voiced readi­ness to open co­op­er­a­tion in fields in­clud­ing tech­no­log­i­cal de­vel­op­ment and se­cu­rity.</p>
