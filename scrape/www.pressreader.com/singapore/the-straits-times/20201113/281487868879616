    <p>Sin­ga­pore is l aunch­ing a new work pass next year to at­tract top-tier pro­fes­sion­als i n fields such as e-com­merce and ar­ti­fi­cial in­tel­li­gence. Called Tech.Pass, this new work pass is aimed at giv­ing the Repub­lic an edge in the global race to woo highly skilled tech­nol­ogy pro­fes­sion­als.</p>
    <p>Tech.Pass will be valid for two years and, de­pend­ing on cer­tain cri­te­ria, can be re­newed once for an­other two years. Ap­pli­ca­tions for it will start in Jan­uary, and 500 places will be avail­able when it is launched.</p>
    <p>Hav­ing such ex­perts in Sin­ga­pore will not only al­low them to bring their cap­i­tal, net­works and know-how to the coun­try’s tech ecosys­tem, but it will also cre­ate op­por­tu­ni­ties for Sin­ga­pore­ans, said Min­is­ter for Trade and Industry Chan Chun Sing yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>“Tech.Pass will add to the crit­i­cal mass of es­tab­lished tech ta­lent in Sin­ga­pore and cre­ate a fly­wheel ef­fect to fur­ther strengthen our po­si­tion as a lead­ing tech hub for the re­gion,” he said, when an­nounc­ing the launch of Tech.Pass.</p>
    <p>The Eco­nomic De­vel­op­ment Board (EDB) will ad­min­is­ter Tech.Pass, with the sup­port of the Min­istry of Man­power.</p>
    <p>EDB said that Tech.Pass would help the Repub­lic develop a strong base of tech­nol­ogy com­pa­nies and ta­lent to en­sure that Sin­ga­pore re­mains glob­ally com­pet­i­tive.</p>
    <p>“This will also cre­ate more op­por­tu­ni­ties for lo­cal tech ta­lent to work in glob­ally com­pet­i­tive teams along­side top tech ta­lent from all over the world,” it added.</p>
    <p>The tech sec­tor is poised to be a large en­gine of growth for Sin­ga­pore, and a study done by Te­masek, Google and con­sul­tancy Bain & Com­pany pub­lished on Tues­day found that the coun­try’s In­ter­net econ­omy – or busi­ness con­ducted on­line – is on track to reach US$22 bil­lion (S$29.7 bil­lion) by 2025.</p>
    <p>The same re­port noted that Sin­ga­pore housed the head­quar­ters of a large num­ber of big firms, in­clud­ing e-com­merce plat­form Lazada and In­ter­net plat­form Shopee’s owner Sea.</p>
    <p>To be el­i­gi­ble for Tech.Pass, can­di­dates must meet at least two of three cri­te­ria:</p>
    <p>A last drawn monthly salary of at least $20,000 in the past year; At least five years of cu­mu­la­tive ex­pe­ri­ence in a lead­ing role in a tech firm with a val­u­a­tion or mar­ket cap­i­tal­i­sa­tion of at least US$500 mil­lion or at least US$30 mil­lion fund­ing and be­yond; or</p>
    <p>At least five years of cu­mu­la­tive ex­pe­ri­ence in a lead­ing role in the de­vel­op­ment of a tech prod­uct that has at least 100,000 monthly ac­tive users or at least US$100 mil­lion in rev­enue.</p>
    <p>Pass hold­ers can start and op­er­ate a busi­ness, serve on the board of di­rec­tors of a Sin­ga­pore-based com­pany or be a share­holder or in­vestor in com­pa­nies here.</p>
    <p>They can also take up lec­tur­ing roles in in­sti­tutes of higher learn­ing, serve as a men­tor or ad­viser to com­pa­nies here, and con­duct cor­po­rate train­ing.</p>
    <p>Those re­new­ing Tech.Pass would need to have earned at least $240,000 in as­sess­able in­come over the first two years or demon­strated to­tal an­nual busi­ness spend­ing of at least $100,000, among other re­quire­ments.</p>
    <p>Tech.Pass builds on the Tech@SG pro­gramme, which spells out more flex­i­ble re­quire­ments for for­eign pro­fes­sion­als to ap­ply for an Em­ploy­ment Pass to work here with a fixed monthly salary of at least $4,500.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore is not alone in the quest to woo global top-tier ta­lent, and Mr Chan noted yes­ter­day that many coun­tries have their own schemes to com­pete for them.</p>
    <p>He said in Par­lia­ment last year that coun­tries like Thai­land, China and France are al­ready mak­ing their pitch for highly skilled tech pro­fes­sion­als. He pointed out how both France and Thai­land have spe­cial visa pro­grammes to make it eas­ier for tech ta­lent to be em­ployed there.</p>
    <p>He had warned then that Sin­ga­pore would likely be left be­hind un­less it also at­tracted such ta­lent.</p>
