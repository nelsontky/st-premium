    <p>Af­ter start­ing his ca­reer in the semi­con­duc­tor in­dus­try, Mr Ja­cob Ong switched to be­com­ing a sec­ondary school teacher in 2012.</p>
    <p>He had then just com­pleted a part-time de­gree in elec­tri­cal engi­neer­ing at the Na­tional Univer­sity of Singapore.</p>
    <p>But af­ter five years of teach­ing de­sign and tech­nol­ogy and com­puter ap­pli­ca­tions, Mr Ong, 36, de­cided to re­turn to the elec­tron­ics clus­ter and left his teach­ing job at the end of 2017.</p>
    <p>In April last year, af­ter over a year of job hunt­ing and tak­ing on a tem­po­rary role as a tu­tor, he landed a po­si­tion at his former em­ployer Glob­alFoundrie­s through Work­force Singapore’s six-month pro­fes­sional con­ver­sion pro­gramme for elec­tron­ics en­gi­neers.</p>
    <p>Mr Ong, a se­nior en­gi­neer, picked up skills in ar­eas such as ra­dio fre­quency test­ing and in­stru­men­ta­tion, as well as elec­tro­mag­netic sim­u­la­tors and soft­ware, which helped him read­just to work­ing in the elec­tron­ics sec­tor.</p>
    <p>“While the fun­da­men­tal skills re­quired are the same (to­day), the kind of (work I do has changed),” he said.</p>
    <p>His role in­volves more re­spon­si­bil­i­ties be­yond op­er­a­tional func­tions such as tak­ing mea­sure­ments, which he was do­ing in his first stint at the semi­con­duc­tor firm.</p>
    <p>His time as an ed­u­ca­tor taught him some valu­able soft skills, Mr Ong said.</p>
    <p>“To do your j ob well (as a teacher), you have to be very mind­ful of how you (work with) other stake­hold­ers, like other teach­ers and par­ents... and teach­ing helped me build up those (skills),” he said, adding that these in­ter­per­sonal skills and mul­ti­task­ing abil­i­ties have been serv­ing him well in his new role.</p>
