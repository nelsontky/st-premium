    <p>A por­ta­ble ro­botic de­vice that can help stroke pa­tients with their re­cov­ery at home was un­veiled at Tan Tock Seng Hos­pi­tal yes­ter­day. Aided by the ro­bot, pa­tients can do the repet­i­tive ex­er­cises needed to re­gain con­trol in their arms and build up their strength once more, with­out al­ways hav­ing to visit a clinic or hos­pi­tal to at­tend ses­sions with a ther­a­pist.</p>
    <p>A por­ta­ble ro­botic de­vice that can help stroke pa­tients with their re­cov­ery at home was un­veiled at a me­dia event at Tan Tock Seng Hos­pi­tal (TTSH) yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Aided by the ro­bot, pa­tients can do the repet­i­tive ex­er­cises needed to re­gain con­trol in their arms and build up their strength, with­out al­ways hav­ing to visit a clinic or hos­pi­tal for ses­sions with a ther­a­pist.</p>
    <p>The por­ta­ble arm re­ha­bil­i­ta­tion ro­bot weighs 14kg and has been named H-Man. Rather than re­sem­bling a man, how­ever, the de­vice sits on a ta­ble, its joy­stick-shaped han­dle con­nected to a com­puter screen and a rest­ing pad.</p>
    <p>It may look sim­ple enough, but HMan is an in­tel­li­gent de­vice.</p>
    <p>It can sense the con­di­tion of the pa­tient’s arm in terms of strength, co­or­di­na­tion and agility, and au­to­mat­i­cally ad­just as­sis­tance or re­sis­tance ac­cord­ing to his needs when he per­forms the ex­er­cises, which in­volve play­ing a game shown on the screen, us­ing the joy­stick.</p>
    <p>In this man­ner, the pa­tient re­learns sen­so­ri­mo­tor con­trol so that he can re­sume daily ac­tiv­i­ties.</p>
    <p>Fur­ther­more, H-Man will give feed­back about the pa­tient’s progress to his ther­a­pist, who can mon­i­tor re­cov­ery re­motely. This is par­tic­u­larly con­ve­nient amid the Covid-19 pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing t he me­dia launch at TTSH, Dr Asif Hussain, chief ex­ec­u­tive and co-founder of Ar­ti­cares, the com­pany that is de­vel­op­ing HMan, said that the ro­botic de­vice is used in some hos­pi­tals and nurs­ing homes here and over­seas, but not at TTSH – although the hos­pi­tal has plans to in­cor­po­rate it in one of its post-stroke ther­apy pro­grammes some time next year.</p>
    <p>He said that most ro­bots cur­rently used for re­ha­bil­i­ta­tion pur­poses weigh up to 70kg and are lo­cated at hos­pi­tals where their op­er­a­tion is man­aged by oc­cu­pa­tional ther­a­pists.</p>
    <p>These ro­bots are also costly, which makes wide­spread im­ple­men­ta­tion a chal­lenge.</p>
    <p>Stroke is the lead­ing cause of long-term dis­abil­ity, and re­ha­bil­i­ta­tion helps those who have had a stroke re­learn the skills they lost when part of their brain was dam­aged.</p>
    <p>As­so­ci­ate Pro­fes­sor Domenico Campolo, co-founder of Ar­ti­cares, said the porta­bil­ity of H-Man can make a dif­fer­ence in the use of such tech­nol­ogy for post-stroke ther­apy.</p>
    <p>“When we started, we re­ally wanted to build some­thing for the home... Our def­i­ni­tion of por­ta­ble was any­thing that fits in a taxi,” he said.</p>
    <p>The Ar­ti­cares founders said HMan can be rented or pur­chased, but they de­clined to share the cost.</p>
    <p>“The tra­di­tional way is to bring the pa­tient to the clinic where you have maybe one hour for the ther­apy. Any­thing longer than an hour is dif­fi­cult as the pa­tient will be fa­tigued,” said Prof Campolo, who is also di­rec­tor of the Nanyang Tech­no­log­i­cal Univer­sity (NTU) Robotics Re­search Cen­tre.</p>
    <p>“But if you have some­thing closer to home, maybe you can have 15 min­utes in the morn­ing, 15 min­utes in the af­ter­noon. It opens up pos­si­bil­i­ties to try new ther­a­pies as well.”</p>
    <p>Re­tiree Seet Jeu Luang, 60, who had a stroke in July last year and has weak­ness in her dom­i­nant right arm, was happy to use H-Man to com­ple­ment the daily hand and arm ex­er­cises she did at home.</p>
    <p>She was one of 10 pa­tients who ex­pe­ri­enced the H-Man that was on loan from Ar­ti­cares at TTSH’s Cen­tre for Ad­vanced Re­ha­bil­i­ta­tion Ther­a­peu­tics (Cart) early this year. It has since been re­turned.</p>
    <p>H-Man is the re­sult of more than eight years of work by sci­en­tists from NTU, in col­lab­o­ra­tion with re­ha­bil­i­ta­tion physi­cians and oc­cu­pa­tional ther­a­pists from Cart.</p>
    <p>Ad­junct As­so­ci­ate Pro­fes­sor Karen Chua, a se­nior con­sul­tant at TTSH’s Depart­ment of Re­ha­bil­i­ta­tion Medicine and at NTU’s Lee Kong Chian School of Medicine, led the clin­i­cal tri­als for H-Man from 2014 to 2018.</p>
    <p>She said it has demon­strated its ef­fi­cacy in help­ing pa­tients im­prove their up­per-limb mo­bil­ity in com­bi­na­tion with con­ven­tional oc­cu­pa­tional ther­apy, dur­ing a clin­i­cal trial in­volv­ing 60 stroke pa­tients un­der­go­ing re­ha­bil­i­ta­tion.</p>
    <p>“Fur­ther­more, last­ing gains up to 19 weeks were ob­served af­ter train­ing, im­ply­ing sus­tain­abil­ity of the train­ing, and this was as­so­ci­ated with high lev­els of pa­tient safety and self-re­ported sat­is­fac­tion in trained sub­jects,” she said, adding that the ther­a­pist will set the train­ing goal for the pa­tient and that the ex­er­cises must be pre­scribed.</p>
    <p>When the H-Man trial was com­pleted, the tech­nol­ogy was com­mer­cialised and spun off into Ar­ti­cares, which is in­cu­bated by NTUi­tive, NTU’s en­ter­prise and in­no­va­tion com­pany.</p>
    <p>TTSH’s prin­ci­pal oc­cu­pa­tional ther­a­pist Christo­pher Kuah said that H-Man, which can also be used in hos­pi­tals, makes repet­i­tive ex­er­cises less bor­ing for pa­tients, as they play a game while do­ing their ther­apy.</p>
    <p>The tra­di­tional way is to bring the pa­tient to the clinic where you have maybe one hour for the ther­apy. Any­thing longer than an hour is dif­fi­cult as the pa­tient will be fa­tigued... But if you have some­thing closer to home, maybe you can have 15 min­utes in the morn­ing, 15 min­utes in the af­ter­noon.</p>
