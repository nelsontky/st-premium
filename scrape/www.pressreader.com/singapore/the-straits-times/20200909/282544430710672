    <p>At a time when TikTok pop­u­lar­ity seems to be a sure­fire way to the top of the mu­sic charts, Amer­i­can singer-song­writer Co­nan Gray does not feel the pres­sure to de­liver songs with catchy snip­pets that go vi­ral.</p>
    <p>The 21-year-old tells The Straits Times in a Zoom in­ter­view from his apart­ment in Los An­ge­les that he has not “paid much mind to that”.</p>
    <p>“I just make songs I think are good and songs I like.”</p>
    <p>How­ever, he is in­ad­ver­tently re­spon­si­ble for the pop­u­lar “Heather” trend on the app, in­spired by his song of the same name.</p>
    <p>In the sleeper hit off his de­but al­bum Kid Krow, re­leased in March, Gray sings about the fa­mil­iar sce­nario in which the at­trac­tive and pop­u­lar per­son you have a crush on has a crush on some­one else in­stead.</p>
    <p>TikTok users have been us­ing the song to re­veal the “Heathers” in their lives, wish they were Heather or talk about how they lost out on that per­son.</p>
    <p>The song’s dreamy, wist­ful mu­sic video was re­leased on Aug 21.</p>
    <p>Once dubbed by Bri­tish mag­a­zine i-D as “Gen-Z’s as­cen­dant king of sad-boy pop”, Gray, born to an Ir­ish fa­ther and Ja­panese mother, spent his pre-teen years grow­ing up in small-town Texas.</p>
    <p>He first rose to fame by post­ing orig­i­nal songs and cov­ers on his YouTube chan­nel around the age of 12, along­side vlogs and com­edy sketches.</p>
    <p>Here are five reve­la­tions about the bud­ding pop star, who is now back to mak­ing songs in his bed­room.</p>
    <p>1</p>
    <p>NEVER DATED</p>
    <p>Asked how he writes songs about some­one he has never dated, Gray says that though he is “re­ally good at it”, he has never dated any­one.</p>
    <p>“I’d love to date some­one, but it turns out a lot of the peo­ple I want to date don’t want to date me.”</p>
    <p>He adds: “All the songs on the al­bum are like my di­ary, which is why it was pretty ter­ri­fy­ing to re­lease Kid Krow.</p>
    <p>“But it’s ther­a­peu­tic to have peo­ple re­late, with Heather do­ing well.</p>
    <p>“When I wrote that song, I felt so weird for feel­ing jeal­ous of other peo­ple, but to hear mil­lions of other peo­ple re­late to me – that’s such a com­fort­ing thing.”</p>
    <p>2</p>
    <p>DE­BUT PLANS THWARTED</p>
    <p>This was sup­posed to be Gray’s big launch year as an artist, in­clud­ing sched­uled per­for­mances on The Tonight Show Star­ring Jimmy Fal­lon and at world-fa­mous mu­sic fes­ti­val Coachella.</p>
    <p>But the global pan­demic had other plans.</p>
    <p>He says: “It’s a bum­mer that I couldn’t do the tele­vi­sion shows and stuff, but to be hon­est, there’s big­ger prob­lems in the world, so I was like, ‘Co­nan, it’s not a big deal’.”</p>
    <p>But he feels that per­haps it was all for the best.</p>
    <p>“I’ve been fully raised on the In­ter­net, so the fact that the al­bum came out through this ‘In­ter­net party’ (roll-out on so­cial me­dia) was all re­ally spe­cial. It felt like the right thing to do for me and my de­but al­bum.”</p>
    <p>3</p>
    <p>RE­VERT­ING TO AGE 14</p>
    <p>Be­ing in quar­an­tine for so long in his Los An­ge­les apart­ment has made Gray “re­vert to the same per­son I was when I was 14 years old and do­ing the things I en­joyed do­ing when I was a lit­tle kid, like paint­ing and read­ing”.</p>
    <p>He has also been do­ing more grown-up things, like “mak­ing fancy cof­fee and FaceTim­ing friends”.</p>
    <p>“This is a scary time for all of us, so I’ve been try­ing to keep it cool, de-stress and stay safe.”</p>
    <p>4</p>
    <p>PRO­DUC­TIVE PAN­DEMIC</p>
    <p>With all this down­time and tours put on hold, Gray has been ex­tra pro­duc­tive and cre­ative, writ­ing and ex­per­i­ment­ing.</p>
    <p>His process in­cludes writ­ing songs from other peo­ple’s perspectiv­es, like that of a char­ac­ter in a book he had read. “I’ve made some weird songs. I can’t guar­an­tee that they’re good ones. But I wish I knew how to pro­duce – that’d be awe­some,” he adds.</p>
    <p>5</p>
    <p>EA­GER FOR A SIN­GA­PORE GIG</p>
    <p>While the first thing Gray will do when pan­demic re­stric­tions lift is to go back to Texas to see his best friend and “give her a big non­corona hug”, he is also look­ing for­ward to tour­ing again, when­ever travel and large gath­er­ings for con­certs are al­lowed.</p>
    <p>Are there plans for a Sin­ga­pore stop? “I can’t wait to come over there,” he says. “My keys player on tour (Los An­ge­les-based Renny Goh) is Sin­ga­pore-born and raised, and she’s al­ways telling me how amaz­ing it is.”</p>
