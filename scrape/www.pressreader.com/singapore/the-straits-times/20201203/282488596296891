    <p>LON­DON • New­cas­tle United’s game at As­ton Villa to­mor­row has been post­poned due to a “sig­nif­i­cant in­crease” in pos­i­tive Covid-19 tests at the club, the Premier League out­fit said on Tues­day.</p>
    <p>“Sev­eral New­cas­tle United play­ers and staff mem­bers are now self-iso­lat­ing at home af­ter re­turn­ing pos­i­tive test re­sults in re­cent days,” a club state­ment said.</p>
    <p>“The club’s train­ing cen­tre site has been tem­po­rar­ily closed in or­der to con­tain the spread of the virus.”</p>
    <p>Five peo­ple at the north-east club had tested pos­i­tive for Covid-19, three prior to New­cas­tle’s 2-0 win over Crys­tal Palace last week and two more over the week­end.</p>
    <p>New­cas­tle man­ager Steve Bruce had al­ready can­celled train­ing on Sun­day due to the out­break.</p>
    <p>The club lodged a re­quest to have the game post­poned and that was ap­proved by the Premier League Board on Tues­day.</p>
    <p>It is the first Premier League fix­ture post­poned be­cause of Covid-19 since last sea­son re­sumed with Project Restart in June.</p>
    <p>The club said it was work­ing with Pub­lic Health Eng­land North East (PHE), lo­cal health au­thor­i­ties and the Premier League to iden­tify the source of the out­break and min­imise the threat of fur­ther trans­mis­sion of the virus.</p>
    <p>“New­cas­tle lodged a re­quest with the Premier League to re­ar­range the game fol­low­ing a sig­nif­i­cant in­crease in Covid-19 cases at the club,” the Premier League said in a state­ment.</p>
    <p>“The club cor­rectly no­ti­fied PHE, which is stan­dard prac­tice un­der gov­ern­ment and Premier League guide­lines.</p>
    <p>“PHE con­vened a meet­ing with New­cas­tle and the Premier League yes­ter­day to as­sess the sit­u­a­tion and ad­vised the club’s train­ing ground should re­main closed and no group train­ing would be per­mit­ted be­tween play­ers un­til Fri­day at the ear­li­est.”</p>
    <p>It said all New­cas­tle’s play­ers and staff would be tested again this week.</p>
    <p>“The Premier League wishes those with Covid-19 a safe and speedy re­cov­ery and will re­ar­range the post­poned fix­ture against As­ton Villa in due course,” it said.</p>
    <p>The de­ci­sion to post­pone the game was backed by Villa.</p>
    <p>“Ev­ery­body at As­ton Villa wishes a speedy re­cov­ery to all those @NUFC af­fected by the virus,” the club said in a state­ment.</p>
    <p>This week­end will see the re­turn of a lim­ited num­ber of fans to some Premier League games for the first time since the pan­demic took a grip on the coun­try in March.</p>
    <p>Clubs lo­cated in the gov­ern­ment’s Tier 2 re­gions, in­clud­ing Lon­don and Mersey­side, can have 2,000 fans in at­ten­dance.</p>
    <p>The city of New­cas­tle, how­ever, is in the most se­vere Tier-3 re­stric­tion band. The lat­est na­tional lock­down in Eng­land ended yes­ter­day.</p>
