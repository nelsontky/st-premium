    <p>Sev­en­teen years af­ter he kicked off his mu­sic ca­reer, Man­dopop star JJ Lin is ready for a rein­ven­tion.</p>
    <p>Hav­ing con­quered the re­gional mu­sic mar­ket, one of Sin­ga­pore’s most suc­cess­ful mu­sic ex­ports has now set his sights on global pop star­dom.</p>
    <p>The 39-year-old is re­leas­ing Like You Do, his de­but English EP for the in­ter­na­tional mar­ket, early next year. Two sin­gles have al­ready been re­leased, Not Tonight (To­mor­row Sounds Good Steve Aoki Remix) with Amer­i­can dance mu­sic star Steve Aoki and While I Can.</p>
    <p>It is the sec­ond of a two-part re­lease. The first, Drifter, com­prises six Man­darin songs and was re­leased in Oc­to­ber. To­gether, the two EPs make up his 14th al­bum.</p>
    <p>In a re­cent tele­phone in­ter­view with The Straits Times from Tai­wan, where he is based, Lin says he started on a jour­ney to re­dis­cover him­self as an artist three years ago. He was then do­ing a tour to pro­mote his pre­vi­ous al­bum, Mes­sage In A Bot­tle (2017).</p>
    <p>“It led me to think about my­self as a per­form­ing artist, as a song­writer, as a pro­ducer. I asked my­self many times, ‘What now? What’s next?’</p>
    <p>“So, I had the idea of start­ing a cre­ative jour­ney, a new song­writ­ing jour­ney with an al­ter ego, but it was all still ab­stract then,” says the artist.</p>
    <p>He made his de­but in 2003 with the al­bum Mu­sic Voy­ager and has won three Golden Melody Awards, one for Best New Artist and two for Best Man­darin Male Singer.</p>
    <p>His vi­sion be­came clearer af­ter sev­eral dis­cus­sions with Mr Si­mon</p>
    <p>Robson, the then-pres­i­dent of Warner Mu­sic Asia, now pres­i­dent of in­ter­na­tional, recorded mu­sic for Warner Mu­sic Group.</p>
    <p>“We talked about bring­ing the mu­sic to the next level, how to bridge the East­ern and Western worlds.”</p>
    <p>Trav­el­ling to Los An­ge­les to meet other pro­duc­ers and song­writ­ers, Lin saw it as an op­por­tu­nity to start afresh.</p>
    <p>“I asked my­self, ‘Okay, what’s the sound that I wanted to give the world?’ I saw my­self as a new­comer, as a de­but artist,” says Lin, who runs mu­sic production com­pany JFJ Pro­duc­tions.</p>
    <p>“That’s the rea­son we de­cided to split the al­bum into two EPs. It was, like, take JJ Lin from one uni­verse ver­sus JJ Lin from the other uni­verse.”</p>
    <p>Be­cause of travel restrictio­ns due to the pan­demic, he has not been back home since Chi­nese New Year. It is the long­est he has been away from Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>He misses home a lot, he says, and hopes to be able to re­turn be­fore next Chi­nese New Year.</p>
    <p>His last ma­jor gigs here were a re­sound­ing suc­cess. He sold out two nights at the Na­tional Sta­dium in De­cem­ber last year, per­form­ing to about 40,000 each night.</p>
    <p>On mu­sic ser­vice Spo­tify, he is the third most-streamed Man­dopop singer world­wide this year, be­hind Tai­wanese star Jay Chou and Hong Kong’s G.E.M. Among lo­cal Spo­tify lis­ten­ers, he was the top Sin­ga­pore artist.</p>
    <p>In May, Lin’s song Stay With You was voted by lis­ten­ers of SPH Ra­dio’s UFM100.3 sta­tion as No. 1 in U1000, an an­nual cam­paign to pick the best 1,000 Man­dopop songs. Ded­i­cated to front-line work­ers com­bat­ing the Covid-19 pan­demic, it was per­formed and com­posed by Lin, with lyrics by fel­low home-grown Man­dopop star Ste­fanie Sun.</p>
    <p>With a rel­a­tively low num­ber of coro­n­avirus cases, Lin says life has pretty much re­turned to nor­mal in Tai­wan. The bach­e­lor re­cently posted pho­tos of him­self hang­ing out with fel­low celebri­ties such as Chou and singer-song­writer Jam Hsiao on In­sta­gram.</p>
    <p>“But my thoughts are that we should never be com­pla­cent. I try to re­mind my­self, my team and ev­ery­one around me to just al­ways be care­ful. I want to set an ex­am­ple for the fans.</p>
    <p>“I try to go out a lit­tle bit, but it’s not like par­ties or places where it’s crowded.”</p>
    <p>Some­times, he goes camp­ing but mostly, he is ei­ther at home or work­ing at JFJ Sanc­tu­ary, his of­fice, stu­dio and all-around head­quar­ters for the past three years in Taipei.</p>
    <p>It houses state-of-the-art livestream­ing tech­nol­ogy, some­thing that Lin has been pas­sion­ate about be­fore the pan­demic made on­line gigs the de facto way for artists to per­form for au­di­ences.</p>
    <p>“I do think that live-stream­ing will only get big­ger and I feel the pan­demic has kind of sped things up and forced us to use this as the only tool to com­mu­ni­cate.</p>
    <p>“But I also feel that it should not re­place tra­di­tional venues and shows. I think mu­sic-mak­ing and per­for­mance is es­sen­tial. Who­ever is com­ing to the show, you want to be able to en­gage with them face-to-face. That’s just hu­man na­ture.”</p>
    <p>To­gether with his team, his goal next year is to help build the next gen­er­a­tion of mu­sic tal­ent. There is a “huge amount of tal­ent in Sin­ga­pore and also a huge amount of op­por­tu­ni­ties”.</p>
    <p>Asked if the Sin­ga­pore mu­sic in­dus­try can pro­duce an­other JJ Lin, he says: “I feel very pos­i­tive about the fu­ture be­cause some­times, it just takes some­body to dream big and start some­thing and it will catch on.”</p>
