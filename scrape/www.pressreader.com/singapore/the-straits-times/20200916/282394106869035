    <p>•</p>
    <p>Move over, pri­vate eq­uity: There are some new buy­ers in town, and they know their tar­gets bet­ter than any­one.</p>
    <p>Bil­lion­aire own­ers from Ja­panese ty­coon Masayoshi Son to French me­dia mag­nate Pa­trick Drahi are look­ing at re­mov­ing their crown jew­els from the spot­light of pub­lic mar­kets. The po­ten­tial moves to take their firms pri­vate mean they will not have to deal with volatile mar­kets and in­creas­ingly vo­cal share­hold­ers.</p>
    <p>Com­pa­nies have al­ready an­nounced US$26 bil­lion (S$35.4 bil­lion) of trans­ac­tions to be taken pri­vate by a re­lated party this year, up about 2,500 per cent from the same pe­riod last year, ac­cord­ing to data compiled by Bloomberg. Many of the deals in­volve ul­tra-rich founders who have been helped by cheap fi­nanc­ing and the slug­gish share per­for­mance of their busi­nesses at a time when the broader mar­ket is surg­ing.</p>
    <p>“While we have seen more com­pa­nies de­cid­ing to stay pri­vate for longer in the last cou­ple of years, we are also wit­ness­ing a trend where pub­lic com­pa­nies are look­ing to go pri­vate,” said Ms Is­abelle Toledano-Koutsouris, head of pri­vate cap­i­tal mar­kets for Europe, the Middle East and Africa at UBS Group. “This has been in the mak­ing in the last few months, given the mar­ket volatil­ity re­sult­ing from the pan­demic.”</p>
    <p>Mr Son, the chair­man of SoftBank Group, is re­vis­it­ing the idea of a man­age­ment buy­out of the Ja­panese con­glom­er­ate, ac­cord­ing to peo­ple with knowl­edge of the mat­ter. The de­lib­er­a­tions re­flect con­tin­ued frus­tra­tion at the gap be­tween the com­pany’s US$126 bil­lion mar­ket cap­i­tal­i­sa­tion and the value of its sprawl­ing in­vest­ment port­fo­lio.</p>
    <p>Last Fri­day, Mr Drahi of­fered €2.5 bil­lion (S$4 bil­lion) to buy the shares he does not al­ready own in telecom­mu­ni­ca­tions provider Altice Europe.</p>
    <p>The ac­tiv­ity comes less than two weeks after Ger­man start-up factory Rocket In­ter­net an­nounced plans to with­draw its shares from the Frank­furt and Lux­em­bourg bourses. The com­pany, backed by the bil­lion­aire Samwer broth­ers, said a stock mar­ket list­ing is no longer the best way to raise money and it can rely on pri­vate fund­ing for fu­ture ex­pan­sion.</p>
    <p>Wealthy in­di­vid­u­als are pur­su­ing these deals at a time when over­all deal-mak­ing ac­tiv­ity re­mains in the dol­drums, with the value of merg­ers and ac­qui­si­tions down 33 per cent this year, ac­cord­ing to data compiled by Bloomberg. Pri­vate eq­uity firms, the tra­di­tional buy­ers for out-of-favour as­sets, have largely stayed on the side­lines: In­vest­ments have fallen 15 per cent this year de­spite record amounts of dry pow­der.</p>
    <p>The trend has also caught on in Asia, where some of the most well­known com­pa­nies are go­ing into pri­vate hands. In­dian bil­lion­aire Anil Agar­wal pro­posed in May to</p>
    <p>buy out mi­nor­ity share­hold­ers of his flag­ship com­modi­ties firm Vedanta.</p>
    <p>In re­cent months, Hong Kong prop­erty mag­nate Peter Woo com­pleted a pri­vati­sa­tion of Whee­lock & Co, one of the city’s largest de­vel­op­ers, after of­fer­ing in­vestors a 52 per cent pre­mium. The cen­tury-old Li & Fung, the world’s big­gest con­sumer-goods sup­plier, was also delisted fol­low­ing a buy­out bid from its found­ing fam­ily.</p>
    <p>“It makes fi­nan­cial sense now to look at go­ing pri­vate if your stock prices are trad­ing lower,” UBS’ Ms Toledano-Koutsouris said. “Stay­ing pri­vate gives you more flex­i­bil­ity in ex­e­cut­ing your plans, and more run­way to do it.”</p>
    <p>Stay­ing pri­vate gives you more flex­i­bil­ity in ex­e­cut­ing your plans, and more run­way to do it.</p>
    <p>MS IS­ABELLE TOLEDANO-KOUTSOURIS,</p>
    <p>head of pri­vate cap­i­tal mar­kets for Europe, the Middle East and Africa at UBS Group.</p>
