    <p>An­field is a fear­some propo­si­tion for any team to visit yet it is a ground Sam Al­lardyce loves play­ing at.</p>
    <p>West Bromwich Al­bion drew 1-1 against Liverpool on Sun­day, lead­ing to the Premier League cham­pi­ons drop­ping points at home for the first time this sea­son.</p>
    <p>Big Sam is now un­beaten at An­field in his last four top-flight vis­its, each with dif­fer­ent teams, and has won two more points than any other man­ager against Jur­gen Klopp at An­field.</p>
    <p>Al­lardyce mas­ter­minded Liverpool’s last home loss – dat­ing back to April 2017 – and while he did not pull off an­other win, the Bag­gies boss left the Reds man­ager rocked.</p>
    <p>“It does (feel like a de­feat) but we have a point more than be­fore so that’s com­pletely fine,” Klopp told re­porters. “The boys are more an­gry than any­thing else be­cause they know it wasn’t per­fect but that’s it... now we have to play the next game in three days (at New­cas­tle).</p>
    <p>“We have to be dis­ci­plined as well, in a dif­fer­ent way. We have to do both, be­ing of­fen­sive, ac­tive, creative and defend... In the end, we drew a Premier League game, that can hap­pen.”</p>
    <p>He also had a dig at West Brom’s neg­a­tive for­ma­tion, which sti­fled Liverpool’s free-flow­ing at­tack.</p>
    <p>“It is an in­cred­i­ble chal­lenge when you con­stantly face 10 men (be­hind the ball) and I don’t think any­one can ex­pect a team that plays like West Brom in the first half, like a 6-4 or what­ever it was,” he told Sky Sports.</p>
    <p>“To be fair, West Brom did their job in­side 90 min­utes. West Brom de­served the point tonight be­cause we didn’t fin­ish the game. It is dif­fi­cult to cre­ate.</p>
    <p>“In the end, ev­ery­one knows and feels we should have and could have done bet­ter tonight.”</p>
    <p>While Klopp’s men still top the ta­ble with a three-point lead over Mersey­side ri­vals Ever­ton, of big­ger con­cern was his short-handed team suf­fer­ing more in­juries.</p>
    <p>A mus­cle prob­lem kept Naby Keita out against West Brom and the Guinea mid­fielder will miss the New­cas­tle trip. Joel Matip also picked up an ad­duc­tor is­sue against West Brom that is likely to has­ten Klopp’s search for re­in­force­ments when the trans­fer win­dow opens on Satur­day.</p>
    <p>“Joel is in­jured and it’s not the first time a cen­tre-half is in­jured,” said the Ger­man, who is with­out long-term ab­sen­tees Vir­gil van</p>
    <p>Dijk and Joe Gomez. “It’s of course not good, es­pe­cially now as he was in a re­ally good shape again but we can’t change that.”</p>
    <p>Al­lardyce suf­fered a 3-0 home loss to As­ton Villa in his first game last Sun­day, but with a full week of train­ing, the for­mer Eng­land man­ager was able to trans­mit his ideas to the team. West Brom still have a moun­tain to climb if they are to avoid rel­e­ga­tion. They sit 19th on eight points from 15 games, five adrift of safety with 17th-placed Burn­ley hav­ing a game in hand.</p>
    <p>How­ever, Al­lardyce, who man­aged seven Premier League clubs with­out get­ting rel­e­gated be­fore join­ing West Brom, be­lieves the pro­moted side made the right choice in turn­ing to him to get out of their predica­ment after sack­ing Slaven Bilic ear­lier this month.</p>
    <p>“It was su­perb to­day and we came out with a pre­cious point for us,” he said. “There is a lot of de­fend­ing you have to do against a qual­ity team with a fan­tas­tic home record. To the man, we frus­trated Liverpool as much as we could. We had to take the sting out of them in the first half. Liverpool al­ways take the game to you. Peo­ple will say we are lucky but that was good ap­pli­ca­tion.”</p>
