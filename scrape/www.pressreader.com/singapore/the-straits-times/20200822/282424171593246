    <p>• Mark Cavendish will not be com­pet­ing at the Tour de France, af­ter Bahrain McLaren omit­ted the Bri­tish cy­clist from their squad that was an­nounced yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>He joins the list of ab­sen­tees which in­cludes four­time Tour de France cham­pion Chris Froome and 2018 win­ner Geraint Thomas, who were both omit­ted from the Team Ineos line-up for the event.</p>
    <p>Cavendish, who has won 30 stages on the Tour and con­sid­ered one of the best sprint­ers in the event’s his­tory, joined the team last year along with Bel­gian rider Dy­lan Te­uns, who has also missed the cut.</p>
    <p>Spa­niard Mikel Landa, who fin­ished fourth on the 2017 Tour, is set to lead the team at the race this year.</p>
    <p>“This year’s par­cours is very well suited to Mikel and his form is strong,” team prin­ci­pal Rod Elling­worth said in a state­ment.</p>
    <p>“The group we have cho­sen to sup­port him rep­re­sents our rid­ers who are most suited to the par­cours and Tour-ready.</p>
    <p>“The past few months have been chal­leng­ing for all rid­ers to be race fit and it’s a credit to all of our guys that we had such a strong line-up to choose from.”</p>
    <p>Bahrain McLaren’s other team mem­bers are Wout Poels (Nether­lands), Pello Bil­bao (Spain), Dami­ano Caruso (Italy), Rafael Valls (Spain), Marco Haller (Aus­tria), Matej Mo­horic (Slove­nia) and Sonny Col­brelli (Italy).</p>
    <p>Sep­a­rately, Tour de France or­gan­is­ers have told teams that they will boot them off the race if they re­turn two pos­i­tive Covid-19 tests in seven days, said of­fi­cial sources yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The mea­sure con­cerns not only the rid­ers, but also other team staff in­side the race bub­ble.</p>
    <p>The Tour, which was post­poned this year ow­ing to the Covid-19 pan­demic, starts next Satur­day from Nice. There are 28 teams each with eight rid­ers and a to­tal of 25 to 30 peo­ple in the bub­ble.</p>
    <p>Tour or­gan­is­ers and a team that had re­ceived the health pro­to­cols con­firmed the mea­sures.</p>
    <p>All the rid­ers must un­dergo two poly­merase chain re­ac­tion (PCR) tests in the days lead­ing up to the start of the Tour.</p>
    <p>A team can re­place a rider who tests pos­i­tive be­fore the race.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing the race, any­one who tests pos­i­tive would have to leave the race bub­ble and rid­ers would there­fore au­to­mat­i­cally with­draw from the race.</p>
    <p>A daily check-up will be car­ried out within the teams and each doc­tor will have to re­port any prob­lems to the race Covid unit.</p>
    <p>All those in the race bub­ble will have to un­dergo an­other PCR swab test on the two rest days – Sept 7 and 14.</p>
