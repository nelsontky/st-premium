    <p>Sin­ga­pore cit­i­zens can ap­ply to join a new work­group to weigh in on the rules gov­ern­ing the use and dis­play of na­tional sym­bols such as the Sin­ga­pore flag and crest.</p>
    <p>This was an­nounced by Min­is­ter for Cul­ture, Com­mu­nity and Youth Ed­win Tong in a Face­book post on Mon­day. “The Min­istry of Cul­ture, Com­mu­nity and Youth (MCCY) has re­cently ini­ti­ated a re­view of the Sin­ga­pore Arms and Flag and Na­tional An­them Rules. As part of the re­view, we are invit­ing Sin­ga­pore­ans to join a Cit­i­zens’ Work­group to dis­cuss how our na­tional sym­bols should be used,” he said.</p>
    <p>“Our na­tional sym­bols rep­re­sent the val­ues we be­lieve in, and re­flect our as­pi­ra­tions for Sin­ga­pore. Join us in dis­cussing how they should be used in a re­spect­ful man­ner,” he added.</p>
    <p>From now till Dec 24, Sin­ga­pore­ans aged 15 and above can ap­ply to join the Cit­i­zens’ Work­group for Na­tional Sym­bols. Fifty cit­i­zens from di­verse back­grounds will be se­lected to at­tend six half-day ses­sions from Jan­uary to April next year.</p>
    <p>Ap­pli­cants are asked to choose three op­tions from a list of top­ics they would like to dis­cuss. The list in­cludes op­tions such as “re­spon­si­bil­i­ties and rights of cit­i­zens in us­ing the sym­bols”, “per­cep­tions of bar­ri­ers to use” and “rel­e­vance of the sym­bols and the val­ues they hold to­day”. The in­ten­tion of the re­view is to “cul­mi­nate in an Amend­ment Bill to Par­lia­ment” with re­gard to the Sin­ga­pore Arms and Flag and Na­tional An­them (Safna) Act, and “cor­re­spond­ing re­vi­sions to the reg­u­la­tory pro­cesses”, said MCCY in a state­ment on Mon­day.</p>
    <p>On Sept 29, MCCY an­nounced that it would be re­view­ing the Safna Act, which in­cludes the law for­bid­ding the dis­play of the Sin­ga­pore flag out­side homes past Sept 30 every year, an ac­tion which car­ries a fine of $1,000 un­der the Act.</p>
    <p>The time frame for the le­gal dis­play of flags out­side homes is usu­ally from July 1 to Sept 30. It was changed this year to run from April 25 to Sept 30 to al­low Sin­ga­pore­ans to dis­play the flag as a sym­bol of na­tional sol­i­dar­ity dur­ing the coro­n­avirus pan­demic. Some have asked if MCCY could con­sider al­low­ing the flag to be dis­played out­side homes through­out the year.</p>
    <p>In a Face­book post on Sept 30, Mr Tong said de­spite con­cern from cit­i­zens about be­ing fined for fly­ing flags af­ter the le­gal time frame, the law is not ac­tively en­forced. “No one has ever been fined for this, nor do we plan to do so.”</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore­ans in­ter­ested to join the work­group can ac­cess the form at www.go.gov.sg/joins­gsym­bols</p>
