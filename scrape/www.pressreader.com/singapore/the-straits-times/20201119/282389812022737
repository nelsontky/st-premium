    <p>• Eng­land boss Gareth South­gate has said his play­ers are be­ing pres­sured by their clubs to reg­u­late their play­ing time with the na­tional team to avoid the risk of in­juries amid a tight sched­ule.</p>
    <p>With the Covid-19 pan­demic com­press­ing the cal­en­dar, player fa­tigue has be­come a ma­jor is­sue, ex­ac­er­bated by the in­ter­na­tional break, with Eng­land play­ing three times in seven days.</p>
    <p>South­gate said play­ers are keen to play for their coun­try but find them­selves in a “dif­fi­cult sit­u­a­tion” with their clubs”.</p>
    <p>“They are un­der huge pres­sure from their clubs. That is go­ing on in the back­ground, for sure,” he told re­porters ahead of Eng­land’s fi­nal Na­tions League group match against Ice­land yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>“That is the land­scape, whether it is made public or not. That is the re­al­ity. It man­i­fests it­self in dif­fer­ent ways but that is what hap­pens.”</p>
    <p>How­ever, South­gate said he em­pathised with club man­agers as the Premier League ti­tle race is more open than be­fore.</p>
    <p>“We do not just have two or three clubs in the ti­tle race any more, we’re look­ing at six or seven clubs in Eng­land and there is huge pres­sure on every re­sult,” he added.</p>
    <p>“Ev­ery­body is look­ing to try and gain an ad­van­tage and if they feel some­one else is get­ting an ad­van­tage, they want to make sure their voice is heard as well.</p>
    <p>“In terms of the man­agers, there’s a power game the whole time, whether that is phone calls, mes­sages, press con­fer­ences – we know ev­ery­thing that goes on. Ev­ery­body is in­evitably go­ing to fight their own cor­ner.”</p>
