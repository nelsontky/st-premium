    <p>I com­mend this year’s Na­tional Day Pa­rade plan­ning com­mit­tee (A show of unity and strength,</p>
    <p>Aug 10). It may not have been the best pa­rade, but it was most en­gag­ing, given the cir­cum­stances.</p>
    <p>This year has been a truly dif­fi­cult year with the Covid-19 pan­demic upon us, yet, as Prime Min­is­ter Lee Hsien Loong said in his Na­tional Day message, Sin­ga­pore­ans will get through this (Our fam­i­lies. Our friends. Our lives. Our fu­ture, Aug 10).</p>
    <p>It was a child­hood-evok­ing mo­ment as the mo­bile col­umn made its way around my neigh­bour­hood. Grow­ing up, I re­mem­ber my par­ents would al­ways take me to the side of the road to wave to the army troop­ers right af­ter the pa­rade ended on TV.</p>
    <p>I be­lieve the drive-past of mil­i­tary as­sets surely stirred up mem­o­ries for peo­ple born in the 1980s and 1990s. Watch­ing the string of peo­ple, not stand­ing in line for a sale but for Sin­ga­pore; un­cles and aun­ties stand­ing at their win­dows cheer­ing, all decked in red and white; fam­i­lies from gen­er­a­tions X to Z, wav­ing the flag; and gasps of won­der all round at the sight of the fine ma­chin­ery.</p>
    <p>The sense of pa­tri­o­tism was stronger than ever be­fore, and for a mo­ment, we all for­got about the</p>
    <p>Covid-19 pan­demic.</p>
    <p>The fes­tiv­i­ties ended with the neigh­bour­hood fire­works.</p>
    <p>As the hour for the dis­play ar­rived, I stood at the bal­cony with my fam­ily wait­ing for that fa­mil­iar boom, not know­ing which di­rec­tion to look in or if we should be watch­ing from my kitchen win­dow in­stead.</p>
    <p>And then, right on time, the show be­gan. There we were, turn­ing right, to watch the fire­works on TV, then turn­ing left, watch­ing the images on TV come to life right be­fore our very eyes.</p>
    <p>The na­tion was not able to watch the Na­tional Day Pa­rade to­gether side by side, in per­son, sweat­ing it out at the Padang, but I be­lieve ev­ery Sin­ga­porean truly felt as one, united at heart.</p>
    <p>Ku­dos to the NDP or­gan­is­ers. Happy birth­day Sin­ga­pore! Look how far we’ve come.</p>
    <p>The na­tion was not able to watch the Na­tional Day Pa­rade to­gether side by side, in per­son, sweat­ing it out at the Padang, but I be­lieve ev­ery Sin­ga­porean truly felt as one, united at heart.</p>
