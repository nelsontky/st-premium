    <p>Four new im­ported Covid-19 cases were an­nounced by the Min­istry of Health (MOH) yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>One trav­eller each ar­rived from Iran and Ger­many and two cases came from the Philip­pines. They were placed on stay-home no­tice upon ar­rival in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>The four were among 18 new coro­n­avirus cases con­firmed yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>There was one case in the community – a work per­mit holder – who is cur­rently un­linked to other cases.</p>
    <p>He was de­tected dur­ing the ros­tered rou­tine test­ing of work­ers in the con­struc­tion, ma­rine and process sec­tors who are stay­ing out­side the dor­mi­to­ries, and was picked up even though he was asymp­to­matic.</p>
    <p>The re­main­ing 13 cases are for­eign work­ers stay­ing in dor­mi­to­ries. Five of them were iden­ti­fied ear­lier as con­tacts of pre­vi­ous cases and were quar­an­tined.</p>
    <p>The other eight were de­tected through sur­veil­lance test­ing, such as ros­tered rou­tine test­ing of work­ers in dor­mi­to­ries.</p>
    <p>Telecom­mu­ni­ca­tions ser­vice provider Zero 1, lo­cated in the Trivex build­ing in Burn Road, in the Tai Seng area, was among the places</p>
    <p>Covid-19 pa­tients vis­ited while they were in­fec­tious, MOH said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The lo­ca­tion was added to a list of places vis­ited by community cases dur­ing their in­fec­tious pe­riod. Zero1 was vis­ited on Sept 13 from 1.05pm to 2.40pm.</p>
    <p>MOH pro­vides the list of lo­ca­tions that in­fec­tious Covid-19 pa­tients vis­ited for at least 30 min­utes, and the times at which they vis­ited th­ese places.</p>
    <p>Peo­ple who were at those places at the same time are ad­vised to mon­i­tor their health closely for two weeks from the date of their visit.</p>
    <p>The full list of lo­ca­tions and times can be found on the MOH web­site.</p>
    <p>The min­istry has said close con­tacts would al­ready have been no­ti­fied and that there is no need to avoid th­ese places, as they would have been cleaned, if nec­es­sary.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore’s to­tal num­ber of cases now stands at 57,576.</p>
    <p>The num­ber of un­linked cases in the community has re­mained sta­ble – at an av­er­age of fewer than one case a day for the past two weeks.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, 39 cases were dis­charged, mak­ing a to­tal of 57,166 who have fully re­cov­ered from the dis­ease.</p>
    <p>A to­tal of 30 pa­tients re­main in hos­pi­tal, while 338 are re­cu­per­at­ing in community fa­cil­i­ties.</p>
    <p>None is in in­ten­sive care. Sin­ga­pore has had 27 deaths from Covid-19 com­pli­ca­tions, while 15 who tested pos­i­tive have died of other causes.</p>
