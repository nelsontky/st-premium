        <p>They lurched through Ja­panese towns like zom­bies – blinded, dis­fig­ured and cov­ered in sores. All around th­ese wretched folk, peo­ple fled, un­aware they could not out­run the cause of this may­hem nearly 1,300 years ago.</p>
        <p>At the time, the Ja­panese peo­ple had won many mil­i­tary bat­tles against for­eign forces. Now, how­ever, they had been blind­sided by a new and in­vis­i­ble foe that swiftly killed a third of the population.</p>
        <p>The coun­try’s first small­pox epi­demic rocked it so vi­o­lently that the na­tion sought new gods.</p>
        <p>On my last visit to Ja­pan, while lin­ing up to en­ter Nara’s eighth­cen­tury To­daiji tem­ple, I passed two stat­ues which ex­plained how this be­came a rare coun­try that has two na­tional re­li­gions. It all be­gan when a Shinto de­ity and a Bud­dhist god joined forces to fight small­pox.</p>
        <p>Ja­pan is now strug­gling against an­other un­seen enemy. Last Thurs­day, Ja­panese Prime Min­is­ter Yoshi­hide Suga de­clared a state of emer­gency over Tokyo and three neigh­bour­ing pre­fec­tures amid a surge in the third wave of Covid-19 cases.</p>
        <p>How­ever, this na­tion has been able to sur­vive many virus crises, with the oldest on record be­ing the small­pox epi­demic of AD735 to 737.</p>
        <p>While the world th­ese days has bril­liant sci­en­tists to un­cover the causes of dis­ease out­breaks, in an­cient times, peo­ple leaned on su­per­sti­tions to ex­plain catas­tro­phes.</p>
        <p>In an­cient Ja­pan, dis­as­ters were widely be­lieved to be the work of malev­o­lent spir­its called on­ryo. It was one of th­ese myth­i­cal demons, named Hososhin, who sup­pos­edly spread small­pox and cre­ated a gi­ant prob­lem for Ja­pan’s Em­peror Shomu.</p>
        <p>Sev­eral of the in­cred­i­ble Bud­dhist sites that at­tract for­eign tourists to Ja­pan were built by Em­peror Shomu in re­sponse to that eighth-cen­tury epi­demic.</p>
        <p>Although Shinto was then Ja­pan’s dom­i­nant re­li­gion, Bud­dhism had ar­rived there from Ko</p>
        <p>rea al­most 200 years ear­lier. It had earned a small but de­voted fol­low­ing, which in­cluded Shomu. As the Em­peror aimed to re­vive his dev­as­tated na­tion and pro­tect it from fu­ture epi­demics, he built dozens of Bud­dhist monas­ter­ies across Ja­pan to earn the favour of Bud­dhist deities.</p>
        <p>The dev­as­tat­ing ef­fects of the epi­demic prompted re­li­gious fer­vour in Ja­pan which, to­gether with the Em­peror’s pro­mo­tion of Bud­dhism, saw huge num­bers of peo­ple adopt this new re­li­gion.</p>
        <p>None of the Bud­dhist struc­tures built by Shomu was grander, or more im­por­tant, than the colos­sal To­daiji. Across many vis­its to Ja­pan I have yet to en­counter a more ex­tra­or­di­nary struc­ture. One of the key rea­sons I have trav­elled to Nara city three times is to re­visit this sprawl­ing Bud­dhist com­plex built in AD752, in what was then the Ja­panese cap­i­tal.</p>
        <p>To­daiji is cen­tred around the mes­meris­ing tem­ple of the Great Bud­dha Hall. Re­put­edly still the</p>
        <p>world’s big­gest wooden struc­ture, the tem­ple with its im­mense bronze Bud­dha and trea­sures in­clud­ing an oc­tag­o­nal lamp, is the chief at­trac­tion of Nara Park, a for­est re­serve home to the re­mains of the im­pe­rial cap­i­tal.</p>
        <p>In Septem­ber and Oc­to­ber, when the au­tum­nal bloom paints Nara in a pal­ette of warm colours, To­daiji is even more be­guil­ing, the kind of set­ting that be­comes im­printed in mem­ory for life.</p>
        <p>Be­neath its steeply pitched roof, dec­o­rated by gilded eaves and in­tri­cate wood carv­ings, I found a work of art com­pleted by an army of more than 10,000 crafts­men. I watched vis­i­tors wait their turn to pray at the foot of this 16m-tall bronze statue.</p>
        <p>It de­picts Vairo­cana, the cos­mic Bud­dha whom Em­peror Shomu asked for help as Ja­pan reeled from the small­pox epi­demic. Rather than seek­ing to side­line Shinto, Ja­pan’s indige­nous re­li­gion, Shomu aimed to com­bine it with Bud­dhism.</p>
        <p>This is ex­em­pli­fied by his de­ci­sion to erect a statue of Shinto de­ity Hachi­man near the gi­ant Bud­dha. Hachi­man had long cast a pro­tec­tive net over Ja­pan. The Em­peror then as­signed him a new task – to de­fend and guide Vairo­cana as the Bud­dhist de­ity tried to shep­herd Ja­pan out of cri­sis.</p>
        <p>The way th­ese two stat­ues stand side by side here at To­daiji seems to me sym­bolic of the har­mo­nious re­la­tion­ship be­tween Shinto and Bud­dhism in Ja­pan.</p>
        <p>To this day, th­ese two re­li­gions are each prac­tised by about 70 per cent of the population, with many peo­ple ad­her­ing to both. That is partly be­cause, in the cen­turies af­ter Em­peror Shomu pop­u­larised Bud­dhism, it be­gan to merge with Shinto in many ways.</p>
        <p>This in­cludes the com­mon be­lief in th­ese two re­li­gions that di­vin­ity dwells within both liv­ing things and nat­u­ral fea­tures like lakes and hills. This re­li­gious de­vo­tion to na­ture, and the en­vi­ron­men­tal conservati­on it has in­spired, is one rea­son why tourists to Ja­pan have so much pris­tine wilder­ness to ex­plore.</p>
        <p>Some of th­ese forests, or even in­di­vid­ual trees, are so sig­nif­i­cant ac­cord­ing to Shinto and Bud­dhist be­liefs that they are de­fined as be­ing sa­cred.</p>
        <p>It was while wan­der­ing one of th­ese pro­tected groves in Ky­oto that I learned about the fas­ci­nat­ing con­cept of na­ture be­ing in­hab­ited by spir­its.</p>
        <p>My teacher was Mr Hiroyuki Watan­abe, a vet­eran ecol­o­gist who lob­bies for the pro­tec­tion of the city’s sa­cred groves. As we ex­plored the old-growth for­est sur­round­ing Shi­mog­amo, Ky­oto’s 2,000-year-old Shinto shrine, he ex­plained that tourists to Ja­pan walk past sa­cred trees with­out notic­ing the straw rope tied around their trunks, in­di­cat­ing their sa­cred sta­tus.</p>
        <p>This prac­tice of wor­ship­ping na­ture flour­ished dur­ing the reign of Em­peror Shomu. The monas­ter­ies he con­structed in Nara were built among lush, sa­cred forests at the foot of Mount Wakakusa.</p>
        <p>The deer which roamed Nara, and still in­habit this for­est, thrilling tourists with their friend­li­ness, have long been con­sid­ered mes­sen­gers of the gods.</p>
        <p>So peace­ful is this park, and so splen­did are its tem­ples and shrines, that it is hard to fathom the deadly chaos that en­gulfed Nara in the eighth cen­tury. Small­pox vic­tims wail­ing in agony. Para­noia and anx­i­ety run­ning ram­pant. Gravedig­gers un­able to meet de­mand.</p>
        <p>The Ja­panese peo­ple des­per­ately needed faith and a leader with a plan. Em­peror Shomu stepped for­ward and set in mo­tion a syn­the­sis of the Shinto and Bud­dhist re­li­gions that con­tin­ues to pros­per in Ja­pan al­most 1,300 years later.</p>
