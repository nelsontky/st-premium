    <p>Lo­cal au­dio firm Cre­ative’s Su­per X-Fi (Sxfi) head­phone holog­ra­phy tech­nol­ogy recre­ates sur­round sound with a re­al­is­tic sense of depth, space and de­tail.</p>
    <p>While many of Cre­ative’s Sxfi head­phones can be used for gam­ing, there has not been a ded­i­cated Sxfi gam­ing head­set. Not any­more, with the re­lease of Sxfi Gamer.</p>
    <p>Fin­ished in black, this wired USB-C over-ear gam­ing head­set with Sxfi tech­nol­ogy is al­most a car­bon copy of last year’s Sxfi Air Blue­tooth over-ear head­phones.</p>
    <p>Each ear cup has a re­place­able leatherett­e memory foam cush­ion, with a ring of RGB light­ing (choose from 16.7 mil­lion colours) on its ex­te­rior. By de­fault, it is li tina turquoise hue when pow­ered on.</p>
    <p>The left ear cup houses all the but­tons and ports, in­clud­ing the Sxfi but­ton, vol­ume dial, mi­cro­phone mute but­ton, RGB light­ing but­ton, USB-C port, 3.5mm jack and mi­cro­phone port for the in­cluded de­tach­able mi­cro­phone.</p>
    <p>This mi­cro­phone has Cre­ative’s Sxfi in­Per­son tech­nol­ogy, said to make hu­man voice sound nat­u­ral while sup­press­ing back­ground noise. It has a red LED light to in­di­cate if the mic is turned on and which blinks when the mi­cro­phone is muted.</p>
    <p>Also in­cluded with theSxfi Gamer is a 3.5mm au­dio ca­ble, a braided Kevlar USB-C-to-USB-C ca­ble and a USB-C-to-USB-A adapter. This adapter comes in handy when you are us­ing the head­set with de­vices that do not have a USB-C port, such as the PS4 gam­ing con­sole.</p>
    <p>The braided Kevlar con­struc­tion of the USB-C ca­ble pre­vents en­tan­gle­ment, but can be a source of mi­cro­phon­ics, or the ir­ri­tat­ing rustling sound you hear when a ca­ble is moved or brushed against a sur­face.</p>
    <p>While the ear cups cover my ears nicely and feel com­fort­able even when worn for hours, the head­band’s pad­ding can be thicker for bet­ter com­fort as you can feel it press­ing down on your head.</p>
    <p>If you have not used an Sxfi prod­uct be­fore, you have to down­load the Sxfi mo­bile app (avail­able on An­droid and iOS) to set up an Sxfi per­son­alised pro­file be­fore you can use the Sxfi Con­trol app (avail­able on Win­dows and Mac).</p>
    <p>As Sxfi op­ti­mises au­dio based on each user’s ears and head shape, you will need to use the mo­bile app – to­gether with your smart­phone’s cam­era – to map your head and ears to cre­ate your per­son­alised pro­file.</p>
    <p>Since I al­ready have an Sxfi ac­count and a per­son­alised pro­file, I just have to down­load and in­stall the Sxfi Con­trol app on my PC, log in to my ac­count and se­lect my per­son­alised pro­file, and the app au­to­mat­i­cally loads it into the Sxfi Gamer when it is con­nected to the PC. Once loaded, you can use the head­set with any de­vice and en­joy its sur­round-sound out­put.</p>
    <p>The Sxfi Con­trol app also lets you tweak the equaliser set­tings and cus­tomise the colour and ef­fects of the light­ing rings around the ear cups.</p>
    <p>The head­set has a Bat­tle mode, in which the Sxfi tech­nol­ogy is said to be tuned for first-per­son shooter (FPS) games. You can tog­gle through Sxfi mode, Bat­tle mode and Sxfi-off func­tion by press­ing the Sxfi but­ton on the left ear cup.</p>
    <p>Bat­tle mode really helps, as I can sense where en­emy fire and foot­steps are com­ing from when play­ing FPS games such as Call Of Duty: Mod­ern War­fare 2 Re­mas­tered on the PS4.</p>
    <p>Au­dio qual­ity is su­perb, with the 50mm neodymium driv­ers pump­ing out thump­ing bass, clear mids and de­tailed highs. When play­ing games, I can dis­cern my vir­tual team­mates’ cries amid the may­hem of ex­plo­sions and bul­let screeches, and watch­ing Avengers: Endgame (2019) on my MacBook Pro is a cin­e­matic ex­pe­ri­ence in which I can hear where the ac­tion is com­ing from.</p>
    <p>On the down­side, the sur­round­sound ca­pa­bil­ity works only when you con­nect the head­set via the USB-C con­nec­tion – not with the 3.5mm con­nec­tion.</p>
    <p>Not to men­tion, the Sxfi Gamer has no wire­less op­tion. There is no built-in Blue­tooth ca­pa­bil­ity or a USB don­gle op­tion for wire­less con­nec­tiv­ity.</p>
    <p>But at $179, the head­set of­fers su­perb value with its au­dio qual­ity and sur­round-sound ca­pa­bil­ity. By com­par­i­son, some wire­less gam­ing head­sets with vir­tual sur­round sound can cost over $400.</p>
