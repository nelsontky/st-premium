    <p>Philip­pine Pres­i­dent Ro­drigo Duterte yes­ter­day de­fended his tough ap­proach to fight­ing the coro­n­avirus amid a surge in cases, warn­ing that “worse times loom ahead”. In his an­nual ad­dress to the na­tion, he also at­tacked op­po­nents, called for a re­turn of the death penalty and de­fended his war on drugs. WORLD</p>
    <p>Philip­pine Pres­i­dent Ro­drigo Duterte yes­ter­day warned that “worse times loom ahead” for over 100 mil­lion Filipinos, as his govern­ment strug­gles to stay on top of a still rag­ing Covid-19 pan­demic.</p>
    <p>“We are be­ing tested as a peo­ple and as a na­tion,” he said in his an­nual ad­dress to the na­tion.</p>
    <p>“All I ask is you con­tinue to put your faith in your govern­ment and work with us in achiev­ing what is best for the coun­try and our peo­ple,” he said.</p>
    <p>But he of­fered scant de­tails about what he in­tends to do in the com­ing days to con­tain a spike in in­fec­tions that con­tinue to stall ef­forts to restart a sink­ing econ­omy.</p>
    <p>Mr Duterte in­stead devoted much of his ad­dress to at­tack­ing a se­na­tor who called him out for shut­ting down the na­tion’s top broad­caster, threat­en­ing to take over the coun­try’s top telecom­mu­ni­ca­tions and util­i­ties firms, and re­it­er­at­ing his call for a re­turn of the death penalty.</p>
    <p>The govern­ment is likely to stay the course i n its pan­demic re­sponse.</p>
    <p>There is talk that Mr Duterte is con­sid­er­ing re­turn­ing Metropoli­tan Manila – the epi­cen­tre of the dis­ease – to a sweep­ing lock­down, although his ad­vis­ers have said the govern­ment has al­ready run out of re­sources to feed those who no longer have the means to earn a liv­ing.</p>
    <p>“To open up the econ­omy to preCovid-19 lev­els is not an op­tion,” said Mr Duterte.</p>
    <p>“Haste makes waste,” he added. “The re­cent up­surge of in­fec­tions when you open lit­tle win­dows of re­sump­tion of busi­ness is proof of that.”</p>
    <p>The Philip­pines, al­ready with the sec­ond-high­est num­ber of Covid-19 cases in South-east Asia af­ter In­done­sia, is on track to sur­pass China in terms of the num­ber of cases.</p>
    <p>Health of­fi­cials re­ported 1,657 new cases yes­ter­day, bring­ing the coun­try’s to­tal to 82,040. China, by com­par­i­son, had 83,891.</p>
    <p>Mr Duterte said the govern­ment’s early in­ter­ven­tion had pre­vented as many as 1.3 mil­lion to 3.5 mil­lion in­fec­tions.</p>
    <p>He also held out hope that a vac­cine “is just around the cor­ner”.</p>
    <p>“Sooner, but not later, the virus that gob­bled up thou­sands of lives will it­self be laid to rest,” he said.</p>
    <p>But be­yond that, he could of­fer only broad strokes about how he in­tends to con­tain the pan­demic and turn the econ­omy around.</p>
    <p>More than three mil­lion peo­ple have lost their jobs af­ter the govern­ment wound down nearly all busi­nesses when it placed nearly the en­tire coun­try un­der a hard lock­down in mid-March.</p>
    <p>The shut­down was eased into a “gen­eral com­mu­nity quar­an­tine” on July 1, but many firms have been un­able to claw back from the brink, with so­cial dis­tanc­ing guide­lines and cur­fews still in place.</p>
    <p>Mr Duterte asked for laws that will give cor­po­ra­tions tax re­liefs, and cre­ate a new min­istry to over­see the rein­te­gra­tion of over 100,000 over­seas Filipinos forced to come home due to the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>He ap­pealed for rent clemency for small and medium-sized busi­nesses, and re­it­er­ated that schools will re­main shut as they pivot to dis­tance learn­ing.</p>
    <p>But in segues that de­railed his mes­sage, he opened and closed his ad­dress by chastis­ing Se­na­tor Franklin Drilon, a politi­cian al­lied with former pres­i­dent Benigno Aquino.</p>
    <p>The se­na­tor had ear­lier slammed Mr Duterte for claim­ing he had dealt a blow to the “oli­garchy” when ABS-CBN, the coun­try’s big­gest TV net­work, was forced to shut down.</p>
    <p>Mr Drilon had said Mr Duterte him­self came from “po­lit­i­cal dy­nas­ties” that were abet­ting oli­garchies.</p>
    <p>The Pres­i­dent re­torted by ac­cus­ing Mr Drilon of lawyer­ing for the fam­ily that owns ABS-CBN.</p>
    <p>Along that line, Mr Duterte warned the “other oli­garchies” that run the coun­try’s big­gest tele­coms and util­i­ties firm that the govern­ment would come in and take over from them if they did not shape up and im­prove their pur­port­edly bad ser­vice by De­cem­ber.</p>
    <p>He also re­verted to his favourite top­ics – drugs and crim­i­nal­ity – and again asked law­mak­ers to re­in­state the death penalty for drug-re­lated crimes.</p>
    <p>Rep­re­sen­ta­tive Car­los Zarate, of the party list group Bayan Muna (Peo­ple First), said: “He fell back on his de­fault mode – drugs, crimes – be­cause these are pop­ulist is­sues he knows he can use to cover up the in­com­pe­tence of his ad­min­is­tra­tion, es­pe­cially con­cern­ing the Covid pan­demic.”</p>
    <p>Added Mr Zarate: “He re­ally did not fully ad­dress that prob­lem.”</p>
