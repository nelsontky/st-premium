    <p>Amy Adams and Glenn Close star in Hill­billy El­egy, a drama about a ru­ral white work­ing-class fam­ily liv­ing in the dirt-poor Ap­palachia re­gion of the United States.</p>
    <p>It is based on a con­tro­ver­sial book many be­lieve ex­plains why poor white Amer­i­cans voted for Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump in 2016.</p>
    <p>So there was much an­tic­i­pa­tion for the film, now stream­ing on Net­flix and drumming up talk of pos­si­ble Os­car nom­i­na­tions for Adams and Close.</p>
    <p>They play two women at the cen­tre of a strug­gling fam­ily from the hills of Ken­tucky – peo­ple some might de­ri­sively de­scribe as hill­bil­lies or red­necks.</p>
    <p>But movie crit­ics have taken di­rec­tor Ron Howard to task for re­mov­ing much of the political bite from au­thor J.D. Vance’s 2016 best­selling mem­oir about his fam­ily, Hill­billy El­egy: A Mem­oir Of A Fam­ily And Cul­ture In Cri­sis, which The New York Times named on a list of “Six Books To Help Un­der­stand Trump’s Win”.</p>
    <p>Speak­ing to The Straits Times and other press by video call re­cently, Howard says it was a de­lib­er­ate choice to have the film be apo­lit­i­cal.</p>
    <p>This is un­like the book, which uses the story of the fam­ily’s ex­pe­ri­ences with poverty and other so­cial prob­lems to show how Amer­ica aban­doned its white work­ing classes.</p>
    <p>But the film’s l ead ac­tresses be­lieve the film can still re­veal some­thing about so­ci­ety and pol­i­tics in Amer­ica to­day.</p>
    <p>Says Close, the Os­car-nom­i­nated star of Fa­tal At­trac­tion (1987) and Dan­ger­ous Li­aisons (1988): “I think it can help (us bet­ter un­der­stand Amer­ica).</p>
    <p>“Be­cause any story that’s very spe­cific about what fam­i­lies are go­ing through in cer­tain ar­eas of this coun­try can only be good when peo­ple take the time to ac­tu­ally lis­ten to what the char­ac­ters are say­ing, and try to un­der­stand some­thing about their life.</p>
    <p>“I think if we did that more, we would per­haps be in a dif­fer­ent place than we are now,” adds the 73-year-old.</p>
    <p>“One of the things art does is tell sto­ries, and every­body has a story and every­body’s story counts. And I did feel like it was an im­por­tant story to tell,” says the ac­tress, who plays Vance’s re­silient grand­mother, Ma­maw.</p>
    <p>Adams, 46, agrees that this fam­ily’s story is an im­por­tant and rel­e­vant one to­day. “That was the rea­son I did this film and fo­cused on the strug­gles that they dealt with.”</p>
    <p>For the star, who plays Vance’s volatile mother, Bev, it was also the char­ac­ter drama.</p>
    <p>“One of the things I find so com­pelling is the strength of the women in the story, be it the mother or the sis­ter and the way that helped shape J.D.</p>
    <p>“And I do think there’s some­thing to be found in un­der­stand­ing th­ese char­ac­ters,” says the ac­tress, who won Os­car nom­i­na­tions for the dra­mas The Fighter (2011) and Amer­i­can Hus­tle (2014).</p>
    <p>Asked if he wanted the film to say some­thing about Amer­ica so­cially and po­lit­i­cally to­day, Howard, 66, says he had “noth­ing with that kind of level of in­ten­tion – and cer­tainly not po­lit­i­cally”.</p>
    <p>“Yes, the book does take sort of an over­view of the coun­try and that cul­ture. But I was only in­ter­ested in it as it specif­i­cally re­lated to the his­tory of this fam­ily.</p>
    <p>“So to the ex­tent that it in­ter­sected with some larger is­sues that have cre­ated some pat­terns of dif­fi­culty and dys­func­tion, I didn’t want to com­ment on that,” he ex­plains. “The au­then­tic­ity I was look­ing for was the au­then­tic­ity that could be ad­dressed di­rectly through J.D. Vance’s fam­ily and their ex­pe­ri­ence.”</p>
    <p>The Os­car win­ner (A Beau­ti­ful Mind, 2001) also had a rather dif­fer­ent goal than high­light­ing the political dif­fer­ences that have so di­vided Amer­ica in re­cent years, seek­ing in­stead to high­light what such fam­i­lies have in com­mon with those from any other so­cioe­co­nomic class.</p>
    <p>“My hope was it would be a re­flec­tion of a kind of shared hu­man­ity that is, yes, rooted in some of the strug­gles and hard­ships of the com­mu­nity, but also a re­minder of how much alike we re­ally are and how many of th­ese kinds of chal­lenges we all share.”</p>
