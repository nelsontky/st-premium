    <p>• Aus­tralia’s most pop­u­lous state said that from Dec 7 it would re­move lim­its on the num­ber of peo­ple at wed­dings, bars and re­li­gious ser­vices and end a ban on pub­lic-venue danc­ing as a run of coro­n­avirus-free days prompted a broad down­grade of so­cial dis­tanc­ing rules.</p>
    <p>The changes an­nounced by New South Wales yes­ter­day come i n time for Aus­tralia’s sum­mer hol­i­days and Christ­mas cel­e­bra­tions, and mark the big­gest lift­ing of pre­cau­tion­ary mea­sures since na­tion­wide lock­downs be­gan in March to slow the spread of Covid-19.</p>
    <p>Peo­ple in the state, where a third of Aus­tralia’s 25 mil­lion pop­u­la­tion lives, would also be al­lowed to drink stand­ing up at pubs, while seated out­door events could host up to 5,000 peo­ple.</p>
    <p>Out­door sta­di­ums could op­er­ate at full ca­pac­ity and the­atres at 75 per cent.</p>
    <p>New South Wales has recorded no lo­cally-ac­quired in­fec­tion for nearly four weeks.</p>
    <p>“We’re deeply grate­ful that since the be­gin­ning of the pan­demic, the com­mu­nity has taken our ad­vice (and) led the way through­out the na­tion and we want that to con­tinue,” New South Wales Premier Gla­dys Bere­jik­lian told re­porters.</p>
    <p>“Be­cause of that, we are in the strong po­si­tion we are (in) to­day,” she said.</p>
    <p>Though Aus­tralia has re­ported some new coro­n­avirus cases in re­turned trav­ellers in quar­an­tine, the coun­try has largely stopped com­mu­nity trans­mis­sion of the virus with con­tact trac­ing, dis­tanc­ing mea­sures and manda­tory mask-wearing.</p>
    <p>None of the coun­try’s eight states and ter­ri­to­ries had re­ported a lo­cally ac­quired in­fec­tion in the 24 hours to yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>In New South Wales, some dis­tanc­ing mea­sures will stay when the re­stric­tions are lifted from Mon­day: the head­count limit was re­moved, but there were still lim­its of one per­son per 2 sq m at most in­door venues. Dance floors are still capped at 50 peo­ple, while drink­ing and stand­ing is only al­lowed out­side.</p>
    <p>For Sydney wed­ding plan­ner Belinda Brett, the lift­ing meant a re­turn to busi­ness as usual af­ter nearly a year of dis­rup­tion.</p>
    <p>“This will stop the rest of our post­pone­ments,” said Ms Brett, who es­ti­mates she has had up to 30 clients put off wed­dings this year.</p>
    <p>“Danc­ing’s such a key part of the cul­tural tra­di­tion of a lot of wed­dings, equally min­gling. A lot of clients didn’t want to spend the bud­get on a wed­ding where you walk into a room and sit at a ta­ble all night.”</p>
