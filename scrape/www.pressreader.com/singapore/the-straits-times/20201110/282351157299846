    <p>HONG KONG • China Ever­grande Group scrapped plans for a back­door list­ing in China and struck deals with more in­vestors to avoid a wave of re­pay­ments, cap­ping a four-year saga that had re­cently raised fears of cash crunch at the world’s most in­debted devel­oper.</p>
    <p>While it was widely an­tic­i­pated that Ever­grande would fail to win reg­u­la­tory ap­proval for its list­ing, the deal’s demise un­der­scored China’s fo­cus on con­tain­ing risks posed by fast-grow­ing real es­tate and fi­nan­cial firms.</p>
    <p>Ever­grande’s an­nounce­ment came less than a week af­ter the shock sus­pen­sion of Ant Group’s block­buster ini­tial pub­lic of­fer­ing.</p>
    <p>The fate of the back­door list­ing was a key con­cern for Ever­grande ear­lier this year be­cause it had promised to re­pay strate­gic in­vestors as much as 130 bil­lion yuan (S$26.5 bil­lion) if reg­u­la­tors did not ap­prove the trans­ac­tion by next Jan 31. But af­ter wor­ries of a liq­uid­ity squeeze caused Ever­grande’s shares and bonds to tum­ble at the end of Septem­ber, the com­pany reached agree­ments with in­vestors to avoid 86.3 bil­lion yuan of re­pay­ments.</p>
    <p>Ever­grande said on Sun­day it had com­pleted ne­go­ti­a­tions with in­vestors hold­ing a fur­ther 35.7 bil­lion yuan, with­out dis­clos­ing de­tails of the agree­ments. The an­nounce­ment sug­gests Ever­grande’s short-term liq­uid­ity chal­lenges will ease, but there are still ques­tions over what prom­ises the com­pany made to hold­outs.</p>
    <p>“There may be a com­mit­ment to a guar­an­teed re­turn for th­ese strate­gic in­vestors,” Lu­cror An­a­lyt­ics’ credit an­a­lyst Zhou Chuanyi wrote in a re­port.</p>
    <p>Ever­grande shares rose 2.3 per cent at 1.06pm in Hong Kong, af­ter swing­ing be­tween gains and losses in the morn­ing ses­sion.</p>
    <p>The com­pany’s 8.25 per cent dol­lar bond due 2022 fell 0.2 cent to 87.7 cents, ac­cord­ing to prices com­piled by Bloomberg. Shen­zhen Spe­cial Eco­nomic Zone, which has been halted dur­ing the four years the plan has been in limbo, rose 6.4 per cent as trad­ing re­sumed on Mon­day.</p>
    <p>Un­der the back­door list­ing plan, Ever­grande would have sold its Hengda Real Es­tate unit, which owns most of its real es­tate as­sets in China, to Shen­zhen Spe­cial Eco­nomic Zone Real Es­tate & Prop­er­ties Group, a Shen­zhen-listed shell com­pany.</p>
    <p>As part of the planned list­ing, Ever­grande in 2017 in­tro­duced 130 bil­lion yuan of strate­gic in­vest­ment to Hengda, and promised in­vestors they would be re­paid in cash or other forms if the list­ing was not com­pleted. This boosted Ever­grande’s val­u­a­tion, but risked a cash crunch should the list­ing be de­layed or fail.</p>
    <p>As the dead­line neared, the devel­oper warned Chi­nese of­fi­cials it faced a po­ten­tial de­fault that would lead to “cross de­faults” in its bor­row­ings, ac­cord­ing to an Aug 24 let­ter to the Guang­dong gov­ern­ment seen by Bloomberg. Ever­grande said the let­ter was a fab­ri­ca­tion.</p>
    <p>The devel­oper has since raised cash through as­set sales and is seek­ing ap­proval for a Hong Kong list­ing of its prop­erty man­age­ment ser­vices unit.</p>
