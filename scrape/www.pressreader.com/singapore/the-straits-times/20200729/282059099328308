    <p>Un­happy with the per­for­mance of her two do­mes­tic helpers, a woman or­dered one of them to slap the other’s face 10 times.</p>
    <p>Filip­ina maid Annabel Tim­bol Reyes, 26, obeyed Kan Choi Yit out of fear and re­peat­edly slapped In­done­sian Ratna Les­tari, 25, on Aug 20, 2018.</p>
    <p>On an­other oc­ca­sion, Kan or­dered her daugh­ter-in-law’s Filip­ina helper, Ms Planta Re­na­lyn Mana­day, 32, to slap Ms Ratna twice af­ter scold­ing the pair for be­ing late in wash­ing the fam­ily car.</p>
    <p>Kan, now 63, was sen­tenced yes­ter­day to five weeks’ jail and a fine of $1,500.</p>
    <p>The Sin­ga­porean had ear­lier pleaded guilty to two counts of in­sti­gat­ing one maid to as­sault an­other.</p>
    <p>She had also ad­mit­ted to one count of in­sti­gat­ing the three maids to pour wa­ter on one an­other, with the in­ten­tion to cause an­noy­ance to them.</p>
    <p>The trio stopped work­ing for Kan and her daugh­ter-in-law in Oc­to­ber 2018.</p>
    <p>Kan, who is self-em­ployed, hired Ms Ratna in Oc­to­ber 2017 and Ms Reyes in Au­gust 2018.</p>
    <p>They worked at Kan’s house in Jalan Paras, near Jalan Kem­ban­gan.</p>
    <p>Kan’s daugh­ter-in-law hired Ms Mana­day in Oc­to­ber 2017.</p>
    <p>The court heard that on Aug 20, 2018, Kan checked her rice cooker and no­ticed that there was more rice than re­quired for her grand­chil­dren.</p>
    <p>She ques­tioned her two maids and Ms Ratna ad­mit­ted that she had not taught Ms Reyes how to use a mea­sur­ing cup to mea­sure the amount of rice be­fore cook­ing.</p>
    <p>Deputy Public Prose­cu­tor Joseph Gwee had said: “The ac­cused was an­gry with Annabel and Ratna as she felt that the ex­cess rice would go to waste. She was also up­set with Ratna as she failed to teach Annabel how to pre­pare rice.</p>
    <p>“Hence, the ac­cused, in­tend­ing for hurt to be caused to Ratna, in­structed Annabel to slap Ratna on her face 10 times.”</p>
    <p>Kan or­dered Ms Mana­day to slap Ms Ratna’s face twice on an­other oc­ca­sion that month. The Filip­ina com­plied out of fear.</p>
    <p>The fol­low­ing month, Kan be­came an­gry with the three maids when she found out that the hot wa­ter in some flasks had not been re­filled. The prose­cu­tor said: “The ac­cused then in­structed Planta, Annabel and Ratna to pour room tem­per­a­ture wa­ter on each other, from head to toe, with the in­ten­tion that the use of such force would cause an­noy­ance to the three of them.”</p>
    <p>The three women did as they were told. They later alerted a Min­istry of Man­power of­fi­cer about Kan’s of­fences and he in­formed the po­lice on Oct 1, 2018.</p>
