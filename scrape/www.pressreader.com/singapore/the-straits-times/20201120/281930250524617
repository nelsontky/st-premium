    <p>•</p>
    <p>WASHINGTON US Demo­cratic law­mak­ers have cho­sen House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, 80, to lead the party into the Joe Bi­den era and pre­side over their nar­row House ma­jor­ity as the most pow­er­ful per­son in Congress.</p>
    <p>The high­est-rank­ing woman in US con­gres­sional his­tory – and out­go­ing Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump’s chief neme­sis on Capi­tol Hill – ran un­op­posed for the top job.</p>
    <p>She was nom­i­nated on Wed­nes­day in a virtual lead­er­ship elec­tion, the first of its kind as the na­tion grap­ples with the coro­n­avirus pandemic.</p>
    <p>Mrs Pelosi said she was “very, very hon­oured” to ac­cept the nom­i­na­tion for Speaker and pledged to take ac­tion to help “crush” the Covid-19 cri­sis. What Congress ad­dresses next “has to be about jus­tice in our econ­omy, it has to be about jus­tice in our jus­tice sys­tem”, she added.</p>
    <p>“Jus­tice in our en­vi­ron­ment, en­vi­ron­men­tal jus­tice, jus­tice in our health­care.”</p>
    <p>A for­mal House floor vote for the post of Speaker oc­curs in Jan­uary af­ter the new con­gres­sional ses­sion be­gins, and shortly be­fore Mr Bi­den takes of­fice as the 46th US pres­i­dent. She is widely ex­pected to win.</p>
    <p>Mrs Pelosi has led her cau­cus since 2003.</p>
    <p>Two years ago, she agreed to serve in the post through 2022 at most, a move that may have cleared the way for her easy renom­i­na­tion on Wed­nes­day.</p>
    <p>The House Demo­cratic cau­cus, in a tweet, hailed the nom­i­na­tion of their “fear­less leader”.</p>
    <p>But ten­sions have sim­mered. In the Nov 3 elec­tion, Democrats fell well short of their stated tar­get of ex­pand­ing their 233-202 ma­jor­ity, fail­ing to oust a sin­gle Repub­li­can in­cum­bent and los­ing at least 10 seats.</p>
    <p>Some close races were still be­ing counted, but when the dust set­tles Mrs Pelosi may find that she is lead­ing the nar­row­est ma­jor­ity in years. While there have been calls within the ranks for new blood in the ide­o­log­i­cally frac­tured con­fer</p>
    <p>ence’s lead­er­ship, the top three spots went to a trio of oc­to­ge­nar­i­ans led by Mrs Pelosi.</p>
    <p>House Ma­jor­ity Leader Steny Hoyer, 81, and 80-year-old House Ma­jor­ity Whip James Cly­burn, the high­est rank­ing black mem­ber, were also both re-elected un­op­posed to their lead­er­ship posts.</p>
    <p>The high­est-rank­ing con­tested race was for As­sis­tant Speaker, the No. 4 party po­si­tion, and it is show­cas­ing po­ten­tial mem­bers of a new gen­er­a­tion of Demo­cratic lead­ers.</p>
    <p>It pits con­gress­woman Katherine Clark, 57, and cur­rently the</p>
    <p>vice-chair of the Demo­cratic cau­cus, against the more pro­gres­sive Demo­crat David Ci­cilline, 59, the first openly gay mem­ber of House lead­er­ship.</p>
    <p>Repub­li­cans during the cam­paign had painted their Demo­cratic ri­vals as “rad­i­cal” left­ists who sought to de­fund the po­lice and em­brace so­cial­ism, a mes­sage they re­it­er­ated on Tues­day af­ter their own House lead­er­ship vote re-elected the top Repub­li­can law­mak­ers in­clud­ing Mi­nor­ity Leader Kevin McCarthy.</p>
