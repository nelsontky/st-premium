    <p>LON­DON • Bri­tish health min­is­ter Matt Han­cock yes­ter­day did not rule out the pos­si­bil­ity that university students would have to stay away from home over Christ­mas to re­duce the spread of the coronaviru­s if there are wide­spread is­sues with out­breaks on cam­puses.</p>
    <p>“We haven’t reached that point yet... I don’t rule out any­thing,” Mr Han­cock told BBC when asked about the pos­si­bil­ity.</p>
    <p>“We don’t rule out any­thing. It’s not some­thing that I want to do. But what’s im­por­tant is that we, of course, keep peo­ple safe and keep the virus un­der con­trol.”</p>
    <p>Bri­tain is bat­tling a new surge in Covid-19 in­fec­tions, with Prime Min­is­ter Boris John­son this week un­veil­ing new na­tion­wide re­stric­tions to rein in its spread.</p>
    <p>It re­ported 6,178 new cases on Wed­nes­day, a marked jump in the daily i nfec­tion rate. The pan­demic has killed nearly 42,000 peo­ple in Bri­tain, the worst death toll in Europe.</p>
    <p>The coun­try is also bor­row­ing record amounts to pump money through an econ­omy on track for its big­gest an­nual con­trac­tion in at least a cen­tury.</p>
    <p>Bri­tish fi­nance min­is­ter Rishi Su­nak yes­ter­day an­nounced fresh plans to help the pan­demic-rav­aged econ­omy with a new jobs sup­port scheme to help keep peo­ple em­ployed on shorter hours, but warned that he could not save ev­ery busi­ness or role.</p>
    <p>Mr Su­nak also said he would ex­tend sup­port for loan re­pay­ments for busi­nesses and de­lay end­ing a tax cut for the hos­pi­tal­ity sec­tor, which has been se­verely hit by Covid-19 re­stric­tions.</p>
    <p>“These are rad­i­cal in­ter­ven­tions in the UK labour mar­ket, poli­cies we have never tried in this coun­try be­fore,” Mr Su­nak told Par­lia­ment as he an­nounced the gov­ern­ment’s so-called Eco­nomic Win­ter Plan.</p>
    <p>“The pri­mary goal of our eco­nomic pol­icy re­mains un­changed – to sup­port peo­ple’s jobs – but the way we achieve that must evolve,” he added, ac­knowl­edg­ing, how­ever: “I can­not save ev­ery busi­ness, I can­not save ev­ery job.”</p>
    <p>At the heart of the new mea­sures is a re­place­ment for the Coronaviru­s Job Re­ten­tion Scheme, which sup­ported 8.9 mil­lion pri­vate-sec­tor jobs at its peak in May and ends next month.</p>
    <p>Un­der the new pro­gramme, sup­port will be avail­able only to work­ers whose em­ploy­ers keep them on at least a third of their nor­mal hours. For un­worked hours, the gov­ern­ment and the em­ployer will each pay staff at a third of their nor­mal rate, with a max­i­mum con­tri­bu­tion of £698 (S$1,230) a month.</p>
    <p>“The gov­ern­ment will di­rectly sup­port the wages of peo­ple in work, giv­ing busi­nesses who face de­pressed de­mand the op­tion of keep­ing em­ploy­ees in a job on shorter hours, rather than mak­ing them re­dun­dant,” Mr Su­nak said.</p>
    <p>Bri­tain’s sta­tis­tics agency yes­ter­day es­ti­mated that one in eight work­ers was be­ing helped by the cur­rent pro­gramme early this month.</p>
    <p>The Bank of Eng­land fore­cast last month that un­em­ploy­ment would jump to 7.5 per cent by the end of the year if there were no re­place­ment for the ex­ist­ing fur­lough scheme end­ing at the end of next month, up from 4.1 per cent in the three months to July.</p>
    <p>Bri­tain is bat­tling a new surge in Covid-19 in­fec­tions, with Prime Min­is­ter Boris John­son this week un­veil­ing new na­tion­wide re­stric­tions to rein in its spread.</p>
