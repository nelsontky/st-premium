    <p>Two peo­ple who al­legedly killed four-year-old Me­gan Khung Yu Wai will be fur­ther re­manded af­ter ap­pear­ing in a district court yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Wong Shi Xiang, 33, and Me­gan’s mother Foo Li Ping, 24, who are ac­cused of the girl’s mur­der, will be back in court on Sept 30.</p>
    <p>They were not of­fered bail.</p>
    <p>The pair al­legedly killed Me­gan in an apart­ment at the Suites @ Guille­mard con­do­minium in Lim Ah Woo Road in Fe­bru­ary. They are said to have worked with a sec­ond woman, Nou­velle Chua Ru­oshi, 30, to get rid of Me­gan’s body by burn­ing it in a metal bar­rel at Paya Ubi In­dus­trial Park in Ubi Av­enue 1 in May.</p>
    <p>Chua, who does not face a mur­der charge, was of­fered bail of $50,000 last month. Her de­fence lawyer, Mr Thangavelu from Tri­dent Law Cor­po­ra­tion, had ear­lier op­posed the pros­e­cu­tion’s ap­pli­ca­tion for her fur­ther re­mand.</p>
    <p>He had also pro­posed for Chua to be dealt with sep­a­rately from the other two al­leged of­fend­ers as she does not face a mur­der charge.</p>
    <p>He had ear­lier told the court that Chua’s case could, in fact, be heard at the State Courts, not the Supreme Court where mur­der tri­als are held.</p>
    <p>Chua’s case has been ad­journed to Oct 6.</p>
    <p>Wong had ear­lier ap­peared in court to face charges un­re­lated to the mur­der case. He is ac­cused of six drug-re­lated of­fences, in­clud­ing metham­phetamine traf­fick­ing and con­sump­tion in 2018.</p>
    <p>He is also said to have been in pos­ses­sion of two sa­mu­rai swords in a Gey­lang East Av­enue 1 flat on Nov 22 that year. In ad­di­tion, he is ac­cused of as­sault­ing a man in the same unit two days later.</p>
    <p>If con­victed of un­law­fully dis­pos­ing of a hu­man corpse, an of­fender can be jailed for up to seven years.</p>
    <p>Those con­victed of mur­der face the death penalty or life im­pris­on­ment with can­ing. Foo can­not be caned as she is a woman.</p>
