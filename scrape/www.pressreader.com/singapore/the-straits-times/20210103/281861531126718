    <p>•</p>
    <p>Drug­mak­ers from As­traZeneca and Glax­oSmithK­line to BeiGene have agreed to cut prices on some of their new­est drugs in China by an av­er­age of 51 per cent in or­der to be cov­ered by the coun­try’s in­sur­ance fund.</p>
    <p>A to­tal of 119 new ther­a­pies – treat­ing ail­ments from pul­monary dis­eases and di­a­betes to can­cers and lu­pus – have been added for cov­er­age by the state-run med­i­cal safety net af­ter ne­go­ti­a­tions, the Na­tional Health­care Se­cu­rity Ad­min­is­tra­tion said on its web­site last Mon­day.</p>
    <p>The av­er­age price cut is 10 per­cent­age points less than last year, a re­lief to both do­mes­tic and for­eign drug­mak­ers that have seen their prof­its eroded by Bei­jing’s push to drive down health­care costs.</p>
    <p>Com­pa­nies are ea­ger to get their treat­ments on the list, even at steep dis­counts, to gain ac­cess to the world’s se­cond-big­gest mar­ket for phar­ma­ceu­ti­cals.</p>
    <p>Pa­tients in China will need to pay for only a small frac­tion of the cost of these drugs out of their own pocket as the lion’s share of the bill will be footed by China’s 2.44 tril­lion yuan (S$493 bil­lion) na­tional med­i­cal in­sur­ance fund, which cov­ers more than 95 per cent of the coun­try’s 1.4 bil­lion peo­ple.</p>
    <p>The list of medicines cov­ered by the fund has been up­dated an­nu­ally with new en­tries since 2017, when Bei­jing ac­cel­er­ated its cam­paign to bring new drugs to its grow­ing mid­dle class as quickly and cheaply as pos­si­ble.</p>
    <p>In to­tal, Chi­nese pa­tients can now draw on state in­sur­ance to pay for 2,800 medicines. Bei­jing also man­aged to slash prices by over 40 per cent on av­er­age for 14 drugs whose an­nual sales ex­ceed 1 bil­lion yuan each. The new ver­sion of the drug-re­im­burse­ment list will be ef­fec­tive from March 1.</p>
    <p>The drugs on the lat­est list in­clude As­traZeneca’s cancer ther­apy Zo­ladex. Brukinsa, the first cancer treat­ment from China to re­ceive US Food and Drug Ad­min­is­tra­tion ap­proval, and de­vel­oped by Bei­jing-based BeiGene, was also added.</p>
    <p>Glaxo drugs Benlysta and Volib­ris, which treat lu­pus and high­blood pres­sure in the lungs, re­spec­tively, also made the list.</p>
    <p>Other top-of-the-line ther­a­pies from multi­na­tion­als were a di­a­betes drug from Novo Nordisk, a medicine for chronic ob­struc­tive pul­monary dis­ease de­vel­oped by As­tra, and an ul­cer­a­tive col­i­tis ther­apy by Takeda Phar­ma­ceu­ti­cal.</p>
    <p>The lat­est in­clu­sions fea­ture pop­u­lar im­mune cancer ther­a­pies known as PD-1 in­hibitors, cancer treat­ments that use the body’s im­mune sys­tem to fight tu­mours – a pri­or­ity for Bei­jing given that China has around four mil­lion new cancer pa­tients an­nu­ally.</p>
    <p>In­cluded are treat­ments de­vel­oped by lo­cal com­pa­nies BeiGene, Jiangsu Hen­grui Medicine and Shang­hai Jun­shi Bio­sciences.</p>
    <p>The list also high­lights treat­ments for Covid-19 such as the an­tivi­rals rib­avirin and ar­bidol, al­though China has largely con­tained coro­n­avirus flare-ups af­ter the out­break a year ago in Wuhan that sparked the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>It is un­clear how deep a cut each com­pany con­sented to for in­di­vid­ual ther­a­pies. The Na­tional Health­care Se­cu­rity Ad­min­is­tra­tion in the past has reached agree­ments with some drug­mak­ers to with­hold de­tails of the price cuts. Those miss­ing from the new list in­clude Merck & Co and Bris­tol-My­ers Squibb’s best-sell­ing cancer ther­a­pies Keytruda and Op­divo.</p>
    <p>For for­eign drug­mak­ers, the com­pe­ti­tion in China has in­volved sig­nif­i­cant sacri­fices. New drugs are of­ten brought to the Chi­nese mar­ket at prices lower than they are sold in the West, but still face com­pe­ti­tion from a grow­ing le­gion of Chi­nese biotech firms de­vel­op­ing sim­i­lar medicines that can be sold more cheaply.</p>
    <p>The process can be painful for lo­cal com­pa­nies as well. Chi­nese drug­maker Sim­cere Phar­ma­ceu­ti­cal Group said it had agreed to slash the price of its newly ap­proved stroke ther­apy by al­most 70 per cent to get it on the re­im­burse­ment list, fig­ur­ing ex­panded ac­cess would fuel sales. Green Val­ley Phar­ma­ceu­ti­cals, based in Shang­hai, said it had taken part in price ne­go­ti­a­tions for its Alzheimer’s dis­ease drug but did not ob­tain re­im­burse­ment sta­tus.</p>
    <p>Global phar­ma­ceu­ti­cal com­pa­nies’ older drugs that have gone off-patent are also fac­ing price cuts. In a sep­a­rate na­tional cam­paign in which China’s public hos­pi­tals bulk-buy generic med­i­ca­tion, prices have been driven down by as much as 90 per cent.</p>
