    <p>Six patrol ves­sels equipped with multi-sen­sor ma­rine ther­mal cam­eras, chem­i­cal gas de­tec­tors and drones were launched yes­ter­day as part of the Repub­lic’s thrust to keep its wa­ters safe.</p>
    <p>The Mar­itime and Port Author­ity of Sin­ga­pore (MPA) said in a state­ment that the 17m ves­sels will re­place the ex­ist­ing fleet which has been in ser­vice since 2012.</p>
    <p>Se­nior Min­is­ter of State for Trans­port and For­eign Af­fairs Chee Hong Tat at­tended the launch. He told The Straits Times that the MPA had worked with lo­cal com­pany Lita Ocean to build the ves­sels.</p>
    <p>He added that through such part­ner­ships, the Govern­ment helps sup­port lo­cal com­pa­nies in an econ­omy that has been badly hit by Covid-19.</p>
    <p>The new ves­sels, which have al­ready been de­ployed, made an ap­pear­ance at the mar­itime sail-past dur­ing the Na­tional Day Pa­rade yes­ter­day, along with other ves­sels from the Repub­lic of Sin­ga­pore</p>
    <p>Navy, Po­lice Coast Guard and the Sin­ga­pore Civil De­fence Force.</p>
    <p>It was the first time the MPA has taken part in a Na­tional Day Pa­rade sail-past.</p>
    <p>The sail-past re­turned af­ter a 20-year hia­tus to un­der­score the im­por­tance of mar­itime agen­cies that have been keep­ing Sin­ga­pore’s wa­ters safe and sup­ply chains se­cure dur­ing the Covid-19 pan­demic.</p>
    <p>The author­ity said that the new ves­sels are equipped with pre­dic­tive ca­pa­bil­i­ties us­ing both re­al­time and his­tor­i­cal data to “carry out tar­geted en­force­ment and re­sponse mit­i­ga­tion”.</p>
    <p>Mr Chee said that the new ves­sels are more durable and re­silient com­pared with their pre­de­ces­sors and they come with more com­pact equip­ment.</p>
    <p>He added that they are de­signed to help MPA of­fi­cers bet­ter carry out their tasks – from re­spond­ing to oil spills to search-and-res­cue oper­a­tions.</p>
    <p>The ves­sels have a res­cue boat fit­ted with a man over­board re­cov­ery sys­tem and their tow­ing ca­pa­bil­i­ties can sup­port search-and-res­cue oper­a­tions. Their dis­per­sant spray sys­tem and con­tain­ment booms al­low them to re­spond to oil spills too.</p>
    <p>“In­te­grat­ing data an­a­lyt­ics with on­board sur­veil­lance, nav­i­ga­tion and com­mu­ni­ca­tion sys­tems also im­proves in­for­ma­tion re­lay from the craft to shore-based com­mand cen­tres and in­creases MPA port in­spec­tors’ sit­u­a­tional aware­ness of ground ac­tiv­i­ties,” the MPA said.</p>
    <p>MPA port master Kevin Wong said that of­fi­cers’ feed­back was in­te­gral to the de­sign of the ves­sels.</p>
    <p>He added that “MPA con­sis­tently ex­plores and adopts new tech­nol­ogy to meet our op­er­a­tional needs and im­prove our front-line ca­pa­bil­i­ties”.</p>
