    <p>I re­fer to Mr Jef­frey Say Seck Leong’s let­ter about re­viv­ing Gill­man Bar­racks (Re­viv­ing Gill­man Bar­racks should be a priority, Aug 27).</p>
    <p>The Economic Devel­op­ment Board has al­ready spent mil­lions of dol­lars on the Gill­man project. There is just not enough of a crit­i­cal mass in Sin­ga­pore for an arts venue like that and be­sides, we al­ready have many in­de­pen­dent art gal­leries that peo­ple can go to.</p>
    <p>Even the var­i­ous art shows that were staged pre­vi­ously in other venues have had to re­duce their ca­pac­ity or even can­cel their shows, be­cause there was just not enough in­ter­est.</p>
    <p>Re­gion­ally, we are competing against more es­tab­lished shows like the Hong Kong Art Week and also ma­jor art shows held in China. And for art lovers for whom money is not a con­cern, there are many shows in Europe and the United States that they can pa­tro­n­ise.</p>
    <p>As Mr Say men­tioned in an ear­lier let­ter (Arts com­pa­nies need per­ma­nent homes to grow, July 28), there is a dire short­age of in­de­pen­dent arts spa­ces for arts com­pa­nies, and Gill­man could very well be an an­swer akin to Good­man Arts Cen­tre. It could also pro­vide spa­ces with low rental for non-profit, art-re­lated out­fits like Art Out­reach, which is cur­rently lo­cated there, and be a hub for arts ed­u­ca­tion for Sin­ga­pore­ans young and old.</p>
    <p>The few food and bev­er­age out­lets in Gill­man seem to be do­ing well, as the lo­ca­tion is ideal for a cosy meal away from the city amid lovely green­ery and history. Per­haps more F&B out­lets with unique con­cepts, that also pro­mote lo­cal artists in their space, can open there.</p>
    <p>For those of us who love</p>
    <p>Gill­man Bar­racks, please do not let it fall to dis­re­pair; it will be heart­break­ing to see such a beau­ti­ful space go to waste.</p>
