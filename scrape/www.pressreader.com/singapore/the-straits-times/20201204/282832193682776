    <p>LOS AN­GE­LES • The Os­caraward­ing Academy is ex­plor­ing op­tions on how an in-per­son cer­e­mony can be held next year, ac­cord­ing to a re­port from Hol­ly­wood trade pub­li­ca­tion Va­ri­ety.</p>
    <p>The Academy of Mo­tion Pic­ture Arts and Sci­ences moved the 93rd Academy Awards cer­e­mony from Feb 28 to April 25 next year due to the coro­n­avirus pan­demic. The or­gan­is­ers had hoped that cin­e­mas in the United States would be open again in spring, which would al­low more films to com­pete i n the awards, the re­port said.</p>
    <p>Va­ri­ety re­ported ear­lier on Tues­day that next year’s Os­cars will be or­gan­ised tra­di­tion­ally as an “in­per­son tele­cast” and will not be a vir­tual event, but it clar­i­fied later that the Academy has not con­firmed its plans for the Os­cars.</p>
    <p>The Academy Awards are tra­di­tion­ally held at the 3,400-seater Dolby Theatre in Los An­ge­les. But be­cause of the pan­demic, the num­ber of peo­ple who will be al­lowed to at­tend is un­clear if a live cer­e­mony is held.</p>
    <p>“The Academy has done a walk­through of the Dolby re­cently to see all the mul­ti­ple op­tions,” the re­port added, cit­ing an awards pub­li­cist fa­mil­iar with the sit­u­a­tion.</p>
    <p>The Academy of Mo­tion Pic­ture Arts and Sci­ences and Walt Dis­ney-owned broad­caster ABC did not im­me­di­ately re­spond to re­quests for com­ment.</p>
    <p>Tele­vi­sion’s Emmy Awards in Septem­ber were a vir­tual-only cer­e­mony. In­clud­ing the host Jimmy Kim­mel, only pro­duc­tion staff and a hand­ful of stars were al­lowed inside the event venue at the Sta­ples Cen­tre in down­town Los An­ge­les.</p>
