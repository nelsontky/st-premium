    <p>LON­DON • Chelsea man­ager Frank Lam­pard said the Blues “have to be care­ful get­ting ex­cited by top-four fin­ishes” and will be look­ing to close the gap on Liver­pool and Manchester City next sea­son.</p>
    <p>Chelsea sealed a Cham­pi­ons League place af­ter a 2-0 home win over Wolver­hamp­ton Wan­der­ers on Sun­day. The Blues had not ended a round of fix­tures out­side the top four since Oct 6.</p>
    <p>Chelsea can cap an en­cour­ag­ing first sea­son in charge for Lam­pard if they can beat Arse­nal in the FA Cup fi­nal at Wem­b­ley on Satur­day. They also have to face Bay­ern Munich in the Cham­pi­ons League last 16 but trail 3-0 from the first leg ahead of the trip to Ger­many next month.</p>
    <p>“I sup­pose at Chelsea we have to be care­ful get­ting ex­cited by top­four fin­ishes, but com­ing into the job, I don’t think a lot of peo­ple put us in that bracket,” Lam­pard told Sky Sports. “We know where we are at, it is a progress and can we get bet­ter? And now we’ve se­cured top four can we look to im­prove to close that gap?</p>
    <p>“The gap is there for a rea­son and there be­cause Manchester City and Liver­pool have taken it to dif­fer­ent lev­els.”</p>
    <p>Chelsea lost 12 times in the league for only the sec­ond time since Ro­man Abramovich be­came owner in 2003. And Lam­pard knows his team’s in­con­sis­tent spells must be cut out to have any chance of clos­ing the 33-point gap to Liver­pool.</p>
    <p>He has al­ready strength­ened his squad, with new German striker Timo Werner, signed from Leipzig for next sea­son, watch­ing in a mask in the Stam­ford Bridge stands. Lam­pard has also se­cured the sig­na­ture of Ajax play­maker Hakim Ziyech, with re­ports sug­gest­ing he is con­sid­er­ing moves for Atletico Madrid goal­keeper Jan Oblak, West Ham mid­fielder De­clan Rice and Bayer Lev­erkusen’s Kai Havertz.</p>
    <p>In­trigu­ingly, he dropped Kepa Ar­riz­a­bal­aga as Ar­gen­tinian veteran Willy Ca­ballero started in goal. Er­ror-prone Kepa, linked with a clos­esea­son move, has strug­gled to live up to his price tag as the world’s most ex­pen­sive goal­keeper since the Spa­niard’s £71.6 mil­lion (S$126.9 mil­lion) trans­fer from Ath­letic Bil­bao in 2018.</p>
    <p>“What we’ve done this sea­son is take the op­por­tu­nity to bring in the younger play­ers and im­prove the ex­ist­ing play­ers,” Lam­pard said.</p>
    <p>“The chal­lenge now is to see what more we can do next sea­son.”</p>

        <p data-role="text">Frank Lam&#xAD;pard, with de&#xAD;fender An&#xAD;to&#xAD;nio Rudi&#xAD;ger, has steered Chelsea to fourth place in his first sea&#xAD;son as coach. It is the high&#xAD;est fin&#xAD;ish for an English man&#xAD;ager in his de&#xAD;but Premier League cam&#xAD;paign since Frank Clark led Not&#xAD;ting&#xAD;ham For&#xAD;est to third po&#xAD;si&#xAD;tion in 1994-95.</p>
