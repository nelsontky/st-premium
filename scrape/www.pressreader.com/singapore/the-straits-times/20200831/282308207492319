    <p>NICE • Ineos rider Luke Rowe said on Saturday that the de­ci­sion to call a truce on the rain-lashed and treach­er­ous open­ing stage of the Tour de France was the right move and blasted a ri­val as “stupid” for ig­nor­ing it.</p>
    <p>The stage, which started and ended on Nice’s Prom­e­nade des Anglais, was won by Nor­way’s Alexander Kristoff. But it was marred by so many crashes that it be­came a lottery be­fore agree­ment was reached to slow the pace to avoid fur­ther dam­age.</p>
    <p>“Whilst you want to race and put on the best show, you could see how many crashes there were and that was with the three de­scents at a very care­ful speed,” said Rowe.</p>
    <p>In the ab­sence of pre­vi­ous win­ners Chris Froome and Geraint Thomas, the 30-year-old from Cardiff might not be the key rider at Ineos. How­ever, he is an in­flu­en­tial voice even if some ri­vals may not want to hear him.</p>
    <p>Rowe claimed Miguel An­gel Lopez, who crashed heav­ily into a traf­fic sign, and his As­tana team had not co­op­er­ated with the truce.</p>
    <p>“As a re­sult their leader was left on his back. They made them­selves look pretty stupid,” said Rowe.</p>
    <p>The Tour de France should have been held in June, but the twom­onth de­lay due to the coro­n­avirus pan­demic means more poor weather is ex­pected.</p>
    <p>“The prob­lem was it hasn’t rained for two, three months, then it rains and it was lit­er­ally like ice,” added Rowe. “I think half the teams had around half of their team who hit the ground to­day.”</p>
    <p>Bel­gian veteran Philippe Gil­bert of Lotto Soudal is out of the Tour, hav­ing frac­tured a knee in one of the dozens of falls around the rainslick roads of Nice.</p>
    <p>Ac­ci­dents in cy­cling have been head­line events in re­cent weeks. Bel­gian rookie Remco Evenepoel plunged head first into a ravine at the Tour of Lom­bardy while sprinter Fabio Jakob­sen said he felt “lucky to be alive” af­ter a hor­ror crash at the Tour of Poland.</p>
    <p>But 2011 Tour de France cham­pion Bri­tain’s Bradley Wig­gins told any moan­ers to toughen up.</p>
    <p>“It’s a tough sport, if you don’t like it, prob­a­bly re­tire,” he said.</p>
    <p>De­ce­un­inck-Quick­Step’s French­man Ju­lian Alaphilipp­e won the sec­ond stage yes­ter­day to claim the yel­low jersey, com­plet­ing the 186km moun­tain ride from Nice Haut Pays to Nice ahead of Sun­web’s Marc Hirschi. Mitchel­ton-Scott’s Adam Yates was third.</p>
