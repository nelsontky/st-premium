    <p>A new ser­vices and in­vest­ment agree­ment between Sin­ga­pore and Kaza­khstan will bol­ster trade ties that have been grow­ing in strength in re­cent years.</p>
    <p>Ne­go­ti­a­tions over the pact, which is part of a deal between Sin­ga­pore and the Eurasian Eco­nomic Union (EAEU), are ex­pected to be con­cluded soon, the Min­istry of Trade and In­dus­try (MTI) said ear­lier this month.</p>
    <p>“Sin­ga­pore and Kaza­khstan have been steadily strength­en­ing our eco­nomic ties... and com­pa­nies from both coun­tries have es­tab­lished pres­ence in each other’s mar­kets,” a min­istry spokesman added.</p>
    <p>Kaza­khstan’s Trade and In­te­gra­tion Min­is­ter Bakhyt Sultanov told The Straits Times by e-mail that five rounds of talks had been held so far, adding: “Un­for­tu­nately, the pan­demic has also af­fected the dy­nam­ics of ne­go­ti­a­tions.”</p>
    <p>Both coun­tries “con­tinue to work on con­clud­ing the agree­ment through e-mail ex­changes and on­line meet­ings”, he said.</p>
    <p>Kaza­khstan is Sin­ga­pore’s largest trad­ing part­ner in Cen­tral Asia, data out last year noted, with bi­lat­eral trade in goods amount­ing to $133.6 mil­lion in 2017, three times the lev­els of a decade ago.</p>
    <p>Mr Sultanov said gov­ern­ments have im­posed re­stric­tions on the ex­port of es­sen­tial items such as med­i­cal sup­plies and food amid the Covid-19 pan­demic to en­sure their cit­i­zens have enough but this will harm all coun­tries in the long term, par­tic­u­larly vul­ner­a­ble ones.</p>
    <p>“The re­stric­tive mea­sures im­posed on ex­ports to pro­tect do­mes­tic mar­kets con­trib­ute to a de­crease in sup­ply in world mar­kets,” he noted, adding that prices are likely to in­crease as a re­sult.</p>
    <p>Mr Sultanov’s call for open trade re­in­forces Sin­ga­pore’s stance on the im­por­tance of keep­ing sup­ply lines open to en­sure economies around the world can bounce back from the pan­demic quickly.</p>
    <p>He said: “Trade is the en­gine of progress. This is why we aim to lib­er­alise trade and eco­nomic co­op­er­a­tion with other coun­tries and as­so­ci­a­tions as much as pos­si­ble.”</p>
    <p>Mr Sultanov said Kaza­khstan had re­vised a ban – i ntro­duced i n March amid the pan­demic – on agri­cul­tural items. It an­nounced in May that it will lift ex­port re­stric­tions on grain and flour, among other mea­sures, given that the coun­try is no longer fac­ing food se­cu­rity is­sues.</p>
    <p>He hoped the agree­ments un­der the EAEU-Sin­ga­pore deal will help Kaza­khstan “de­velop the mar­kets of the en­tire Asia-Pa­cific mar­ket”.</p>
    <p>The deal signed so far pro­vides duty-free ac­cess for 40 per cent of Sin­ga­pore’s prod­ucts into the EAEU. This will be in­creased up to 87 per cent “af­ter all tran­si­tion pe­ri­ods, which range from three to 10 years”, Mr Sultanov said.</p>
    <p>In turn, Sin­ga­pore pro­vides du­tyfree ac­cess for all goods from EAEU coun­tries, he added.</p>
    <p>“Sin­ga­pore is recog­nised as the largest fi­nan­cial cen­tre i n Asia (and) has a lead­ing po­si­tion in the world in terms of the use of in­for­ma­tion and com­mu­ni­ca­tion tech­nolo­gies,” he added.</p>
    <p>“Kaza­khstan would like to learn from Sin­ga­pore’s pos­i­tive ex­pe­ri­ence in these areas.”</p>
    <p>NO LOCK­DOWN</p>
    <p>Trade is the en­gine of progress. This is why we aim to lib­er­alise trade and eco­nomic co­op­er­a­tion with other coun­tries and as­so­ci­a­tions as much as pos­si­ble.</p>
