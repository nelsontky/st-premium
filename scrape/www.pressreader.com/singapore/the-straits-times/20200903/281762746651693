    <p>Af­ter months of be­ing cooped up in their dor­mi­to­ries, some 50 for­eign work­ers had the chance to stretch their legs in Labrador Park and HortPark yes­ter­day af­ter­noon, as part of a trial run to al­low more healthy work­ers out of their dor­mi­to­ries on rest days.</p>
    <p>The work­ers, who are ei­ther re­cov­ered Covid-19 pa­tients or have tested neg­a­tive for the coro­n­avirus in the last 14 days, played games, ate and went for walks in the park, in small groups of five.</p>
    <p>They were cho­sen by the Min­istry of Man­power (MOM), which had col­lab­o­rated with non-gov­ern­men­tal or­gan­i­sa­tion (NGO) Al­liance of Guest Work­ers Out­reach (AGWO) to or­gan­ise the out­ing.</p>
    <p>MOM’s di­rec­tor of en­gage­ment for the for­eign man­power man­age­ment di­vi­sion, Mr Tan Shu Xiang, said the out­ing was to al­low the work­ers to re­lax and en­joy them­selves, es­pe­cially as the last few months have been chal­leng­ing for many of them.</p>
    <p>“We un­der­stand that we need to look af­ter both their phys­i­cal and their men­tal well-be­ing,” he said.</p>
    <p>The min­istry is also ex­plor­ing more of such recre­ational op­tions for the work­ers, now that most have re­turned to work, he added.</p>
    <p>Work­ers are still largely re­stricted to their work­places and dorms, or ap­proved lo­ca­tions like recre­ation cen­tres, as part of mea­sures to con­trol the virus spread among the pop­u­la­tion.</p>
    <p>“We will grad­u­ally al­low more and more work­ers to be able to en­joy their days off by com­ing out of the dor­mi­to­ries,” said Mr Tan, adding that this will have to be done in a cal­i­brated man­ner.</p>
    <p>AGWO chair­man Sa­muel Gift Stephen and Hope Ini­tia­tive Al­liance (HIA) pres­i­dent Ezekiel Tan said that AGWO, which falls un­der HIA, plans to con­tinue or­gan­is­ing a se­ries of out­ings and ac­tiv­i­ties un­der Project Sun­shine, together with MOM and other agen­cies and NGOs.</p>
    <p>“To use the ex­act words that they (work­ers) have used, they feel im­pris­oned (in the dor­mi­to­ries) and</p>
    <p>for them, just get­ting out of the dorm it­self is a re­lief,” said Pas­tor Stephen, adding that the work­ers were very ex­cited yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Bangladesh­i con­struc­tion worker Talukder Sharif, 24, said the out­ing was the first time in some five months that he had stepped out­side his fac­tory-con­verted dor­mi­tory.</p>
    <p>He has spent most of his time in the dor­mi­tory watch­ing movies and pray­ing, and is still wait­ing to re­turn to work.</p>
    <p>“Af­ter such a long time I can go out­side, we are very happy to come to this park,” he said.</p>
    <p>Pas­tor Stephen said he hopes work­ers can see, through this ac­tiv­ity, that Sin­ga­pore­ans care for them.</p>
    <p>“They see the news and see Sin­ga­pore­ans are freely go­ing around. So now by bring­ing them out, we are also say­ing that... we are here with you.”</p>
