    <p>MORE TO COME</p>
    <p>I tried to use my en­ergy to get the best swims I could – still a lot to grow, still a lot to learn, but I think I’m in a very good place go­ing into a long-course sea­son.</p>
    <p>ADAM PEATY, Bri­tish swim­mer, af­ter rewrit­ing his breast­stroke world mark.</p>
    <p>BU­DAPEST • World and Olympic cham­pi­ons Caeleb Dres­sel and Adam Peaty smashed their own short-course world records on the fi­nal day of the In­ter­na­tional Swim­ming League (ISL) sea­son on Sun­day.</p>
    <p>Amer­i­can Dres­sel, who last Mon­day be­came the first man to swim the 100m in­di­vid­ual med­ley in un­der 50 sec­onds, sliced a fur­ther six tenths off his 49.88 sec­onds with a new best of 49.28sec.</p>
    <p>The 24-year-old, rac­ing for the</p>
    <p>Cali Con­dors team, has now gone nearly a sec­ond faster than any­one else in his­tory, with the pre­vi­ous best be­fore him be­ing Rus­sian Vladimir Moro­zov, who set a then­record 50.26sec in 2018.</p>
    <p>In the 100m breast­stroke, Lon­don Roar’s Peaty touched the wall in 55.41sec, beat­ing his own pre­vi­ous record of 55.49sec the 25-yearold Bri­ton set in the same Bu­dapest pool a week ago.</p>
    <p>En­ergy Stan­dard’s Be­laru­sian Ilya Shy­manovich fin­ished sec­ond,</p>
    <p>with his time equalling Peaty’s pre­vi­ous record.</p>
    <p>“It feels like ev­ery race is a world cham­pi­onship or an Olympic fi­nal, it’s in­cred­i­ble,” said Lon­don Roar gen­eral man­ager Rob Wood­house. “See­ing all these world records is just amaz­ing.”</p>
    <p>Peaty told Bri­tish Swim­ming’s web­site: “I’m very happy to come away with an­other world record and on the 50m breast­stroke (25.41sec) again, it was an­other</p>
    <p>Bri­tish record and a per­sonal best, so I’m get­ting closer to the 50m world record (25.25sec set by South Africa’s Cameron van der Burgh in 2009), which would be ideal! I tried to use my en­ergy to get the best swims I could. Still a lot to grow, still a lot to learn, but I think I’m in a very good place go­ing into a long-course sea­son now, and the Olympics.</p>
    <p>“I’m very happy with my per­for­mances and I think the team can be very happy with where we ended</p>
    <p>up. It was very, very close.”</p>
    <p>Dres­sel, a dou­ble Olympic re­lay gold medal­list in 2016 and win­ner of seven world cham­pi­onship golds in Bu­dapest in 2017 and a fur­ther six in Gwangju last year, set two world records on Saturday in the 100m but­ter­fly and 50m freestyle.</p>
    <p>Dutch swim­mer Kira Tous­saint of the Lon­don Roar set a women’s 50m back­stroke world record of 25.60sec on Nov 14.</p>
    <p>The teams, fea­tur­ing many of the world’s top swim­mers, had been rac­ing be­hind closed doors in Bu­dapest since Oct 16 with En­ergy Stan­dard, Cali Con­dors, LA Cur­rent and Lon­don Roar reach­ing the fi­nals.</p>
    <p>Cali Con­dors won the over­all event ahead of En­ergy Stan­dard, with Lon­don Roar com­ing in third.</p>
    <p>With the Tokyo Olympics post­poned un­til next July, and other com­pe­ti­tions can­celled due to the Covid-19 pan­demic, the ISL gave more than 300 swim­mers a fo­cus and the chance to team up and race again. Ath­letes re­mained in a pro­tec­tive “bub­ble” with reg­u­lar Covid-19 tests and there were no pos­i­tive re­sults reg­is­tered at the event.</p>
    <p>“It’s been such a fun time, this whole bub­ble,” said Dres­sel.</p>
    <p>“This is the most fun I’ve ever had swim­ming in my life. To have that for six weeks is truly spe­cial.”</p>
