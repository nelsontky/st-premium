    <p>LOS AN­GE­LES • Mike Tyson, the for­mer world heavy­weight box­ing cham­pion who re­tired in 2005, wants to prove that older ath­letes are not “washed up” and can still com­pete at a high level.</p>
    <p>The 54-year-old an­nounced on Thurs­day he will make a come­back on Sept 12 in Los An­ge­les, fight­ing an eight-round ex­hi­bi­tion against Amer­i­can-born Rus­sian Roy Jones Jr, 51, who briefly held the heavy­weight ti­tle and has fought con­sis­tently into his 50s.</p>
    <p>The fight will be part of a three­hour pay-per-view event shown on Triller, a vir­tual so­cial me­dia and mu­sic plat­form which has also ob­tained stream­ing rights to a 10-part do­cuseries fea­tur­ing be­hind-thescenes and pre-fight footage lead­ing up to the bout.</p>
    <p>“It’s just go­ing to be amaz­ing,” Tyson, who in May posted videos of him­self train­ing, told ESPN.</p>
    <p>He shrugged off any no­tion of dan­ger for se­ri­ous in­jury, say­ing that Cal­i­for­nia rules will re­quire both fight­ers to wear head­gear.</p>
    <p>The Amer­i­can fin­ished 50-6 with 44 knock­outs while Jones, who last fought in Fe­bru­ary 2018, is 66-9 with 47 knock­outs.</p>
    <p>Tyson vowed that it would be com­pet­i­tive rather than for show and said he wants to re­cap­ture the fear­some form he once dis­played.</p>
    <p>“It’s 100 per cent of it look­ing to be Mike Tyson in the ring,” he said. “I’ve got one speed – for­ward.”</p>
    <p>In a battle of seniors, he also said he wants to show older can still mean ex­cit­ing in the sports realm.</p>
    <p>“We aren’t washed up. Some­body says over­age is washed up but they have a big­ger fan base than the guys who are train­ing now,” he said.</p>
    <p>Tyson be­came the youngest heavy­weight cham­pion in his­tory at 20 years and four months when he stopped Trevor Ber­bick in the sec­ond round in 1986 to win the World Box­ing Coun­cil crown.</p>
    <p>Within a year, he was the undis­puted cham­pion and dom­i­nated the divi­sion by go­ing 37-0.</p>
    <p>But in Fe­bru­ary 1990 in Tokyo, he suf­fered a 10th-round knock­out by James “Buster” Dou­glas in a stun­ning up­set.</p>
    <p>He was ar­rested for rape in 1991 and con­victed in 1992, serv­ing three years in prison be­fore his 1995 re­lease and re­turn to the ring.</p>
    <p>Tyson re­gained the ti­tle but lost twice to Evan­der Holy­field, dis­qual­i­fied the sec­ond time for bit­ing his ri­val’s ear, earn­ing a sus­pen­sion that kept him side­lined for 18 months.</p>
    <p>He had one last chance at the heavy­weight crown, los­ing to Bri­tain’s Len­nox Lewis in 2002. He re­tired af­ter six rounds against Kevin McBride in 2005 in his fi­nal fight, days shy of his 39th birth­day.</p>
