    <p>A de­lay in the di­ag­no­sis of a lung can­cer pa­tient at Changi Gen­eral Hospi­tal (CGH) had lit­tle im­pact on the out­come of her con­di­tion and the ef­fec­tive­ness of the treat­ment she re­ceived, said lawyers for the hospi­tal.</p>
    <p>The ar­gu­ment was made at a hear­ing which started in the High Court yes­ter­day to as­sess the damages to be paid to the fam­ily of Ms Noor Azlin Ab­dul Rahman.</p>
    <p>She died in April last year, aged 39, af­ter win­ning a court bat­tle against CGH.</p>
    <p>Her brother, as ex­ecu­tor of her es­tate, is con­tin­u­ing her court fight to claim about $6.75 mil­lion in damages.</p>
    <p>The hospi­tal, how­ever, con­tended in its open­ing state­ment that any damages would be “very lim­ited”.</p>
    <p>It ar­gued that its neg­li­gence did not cause the pa­tient’s death and that the course of her dis­ease would have re­mained the same even if she was di­ag­nosed a few months ear­lier.</p>
    <p>The hospi­tal also ar­gued that many of the claims, like fu­ture med­i­cal ex­penses, are no longer sus­tain­able in view of her death.</p>
    <p>Ms Azlin vis­ited CGH sev­eral times be­tween Oc­to­ber 2007 and De­cem­ber 2011 for chest pains and lung-re­lated is­sues be­fore she was fi­nally di­ag­nosed with lung can­cer in Fe­bru­ary 2012.</p>
    <p>Af­ter she un­der­went surgery to re­move part of her right lung in March 2012, she was found to be suf­fer­ing from stage 2A lung can­cer. She then un­der­went chemo­ther­apy.</p>
    <p>She had a re­lapse in Au­gust 2014, and a biopsy con­firmed the can­cer had pro­gressed to stage 4.</p>
    <p>In Jan­uary 2015, she sued CGH and three doc­tors for the de­lay in di­ag­no­sis.</p>
    <p>The High Court dis­missed her case in Fe­bru­ary 2018.</p>
    <p>In Fe­bru­ary last year, the Court of Ap­peal found CGH neg­li­gent for fail­ing to put in place a sys­tem for proper fol­low-up of ra­di­o­log­i­cal re­sults and pa­tient man­age­ment.</p>
    <p>Even though ra­di­o­log­i­cal re­ports in April 2010 and July 2011 rec­om­mended a fol­low-up, none was car­ried out on Ms Azlin.</p>
    <p>The apex court found that Ms Azlin suf­fered from stage 1 lung can­cer in July 2011 and that if not for the neg­li­gence, she would have been prop­erly di­ag­nosed and treated.</p>
    <p>The case was sent back to the High Court for as­sess­ment of damages.</p>
    <p>The Court of Ap­peal had also urged par­ties to con­sider a set­tle­ment on the quan­tum, to help Ms Azlin achieve a sense of clo­sure and al­low her to fo­cus on re­cov­er­ing.</p>
    <p>Five weeks af­ter that, on April 1 last year, Ms Azlin lost her bat­tle with the dis­ease.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, her lawyer, Mr Vi­jay Ku­mar Rai, said in his open­ing state­ment that an at­tempt to con­tact CGH’s lawyers on the pos­si­bil­ity of a set­tle­ment had been “re­buffed”.</p>
    <p>He cited the Court of Ap­peal’s find­ings that but for CGH’s fail­ure to di­ag­nose her in July 2011, part of her lung would have been sur­gi­cally re­moved be­fore March 2012 and it was un­likely the can­cer would have pro­gressed.</p>
    <p>But CGH’s lawyer, Se­nior Coun­sel Kuah Boon Theng, ar­gued that the ac­tual pe­riod of de­lay was not from July 2011 to Fe­bru­ary 2012, but a shorter pe­riod from Au­gust 2011 to De­cem­ber 2011.</p>
    <p>This four-month de­lay, she ar­gued, did not have a ma­te­rial im­pact on Ms Azlin’s prog­no­sis, treat­ment ef­fi­cacy or risk of re­lapse.</p>
    <p>The hear­ing con­tin­ues to­day.</p>
