    <p>LOS AN­GE­LES Hol­ly­wood tal­ent agen­cies are woo­ing video-gam­ing stars like never be­fore, bet­ting that they can lead a new gen­er­a­tion of celebrity en­dorsers for main­stream brands.</p>
    <p>A few years ago, top agen­cies rep­re­sented just a hand­ful of play­ers, but now they see an op­por­tu­nity to turn them into house­hold names.</p>
    <p>As the gam­ing in­dus­try grows, play­ers will de­velop projects for tele­vi­sion, pod­casts or an­i­ma­tion, ac­cord­ing to Mr Conor Beese­myer, an agent at Wil­liam Mor­ris En­deavor (WME), part of En­deavor Group Hold­ings.</p>
    <p>“We’re go­ing to see more and more gamers be­come the faces of brands,” Mr Beese­myer said, adding that the in­dus­try is at­tract­ing large ad­ver­tis­ers not typ­i­cally as­so­ci­ated with pop­u­lar ti­tles such as Fort­nite, Play­erUn­known’s Bat­tle­grounds and Call Of Duty.</p>
    <p>His com­pany’s clients in­clude Fort­nite pro Nate Hill.</p>
    <p>While many play­ers are rep­re­sented by small, gam­ing-spe­cific agen­cies across the world, large busi­nesses find it eas­ier to strike ad­ver­tis­ing deals with top firms.</p>
    <p>The four largest agen­cies – Cre­ative Artists Agency (CAA), WME,</p>
    <p>United Tal­ent Agency and ICM Part­ners – have been build­ing up their gam­ing di­vi­sions for years, aim­ing to sign com­pet­i­tive e-sports ath­letes and stream­ers who play on ma­jor plat­forms such as Ama­zon’s Twitch or Google’s YouTube.</p>
    <p>Ear­lier this month, video-game pro Ninja joined CAA, be­com­ing one of sev­eral play­ers to align with the firm this year.</p>
    <p>His long­stand­ing spon­sor­ships with Adi­das and Red Bull are ex­am­ples of where the in­dus­try is headed over the next five to 10 years, ac­cord­ing to Mr Mor­ris Gar­rard, a re­search an­a­lyst at Fu­ture­source Con­sult­ing.</p>
    <p>“These are the kind of deals that be­come pos­si­ble with the larger multi-in­dus­try agen­cies, as op­posed to the e-sports-spe­cific agen­cies,” Mr Gar­rard said.</p>
    <p>All par­ties – gamers, ad­ver­tis­ers and tal­ent agen­cies – are ea­ger to lock up higher-dol­lar deals.</p>
    <p>Ninja’s multi-year deal to per­form on Mi­crosoft’s Mixer plat­form was ne­go­ti­ated by Loaded, a gam­ing­fo­cused tal­ent agency, and was worth more than US$20 mil­lion (S$27 mil­lion), CNN Busi­ness re­ported. He re­joined Twitch last month af­ter Mixer shut down.</p>
    <p>Forbes re­cently es­ti­mated that the top 10 high­est-earn­ing play­ers col­lected more than US$120 mil­lion last year, much of it from en­dorse­ments and brand part­ner­ships, though no sin­gle gam­ing star made the mag­a­zine’s top 100 list of celebrity earn­ers.</p>
    <p>Ad­ver­tis­ing within the gam­ing world it­self still has plenty of room to grow, even be­fore its most pop­u­lar play­ers blos­som into glob­ally recog­nis­able celebri­ties like movie stars or ma­jor sports fig­ures.</p>
    <p>Stream­ers of­ten fo­cus on small deals that ca­su­ally pro­mote gam­ing prod­ucts, such as head­sets or chairs.</p>
    <p>But it is not dif­fi­cult to un­der­stand why big com­pa­nies see an op­por­tu­nity. The in­dus­try is grow­ing fast, and its le­gions of young view­ers are loyal and en­gaged with pop­u­lar stream­ers or com­pe­ti­tions for games such as Over­watch and League Of Le­gends.</p>
    <p>Gam­ing al­ready ri­vals pro­fes­sional sports and mu­sic in terms of the power of its stars, ac­cord­ing to Mr David Free­man, co-head of dig­i­tal at CAA, which has more than 35 clients in the in­dus­try.</p>
    <p>“Hav­ing these mas­sive au­di­ences al­lows us to treat them and think of them as just tal­ent – no dif­fer­ent from other tal­ent that we have in sports, mu­sic, TV and film,” he said.</p>
    <p>“It’s a nat­u­ral move for us to be dou­bling down our ef­forts over the last two to three years.”</p>
    <p>The agen­cies have ex­panded into gam­ing in a few ways – by pick­ing off ma­jor stars from smaller firms, al­ly­ing with spe­cial­ity out­fits and some­times even buy­ing them.</p>
    <p>“We’re just in the first few in­nings of how gam­ing and e-sports are re­ally evolv­ing glob­ally,” Mr Free­man said. “So us plant­ing a flag, and go­ing big with who we be­lieve are some of the best gamers in the world, is some­thing that we strate­gi­cally very much be­lieve in.”</p>
    <p>The smaller agen­cies do not nec­es­sar­ily view that as a threat.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to Mr Ryan Mor­ri­son, founder of Evolved Tal­ent Agency, three of his clients left for ma­jor agen­cies but came back within six months.</p>
    <p>“There’s so much bu­reau­cracy and red tape to an agency that size, and it slowed down the deal flow,” he said.</p>
