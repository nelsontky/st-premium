    <p>While Malaysia con­tin­ues to strug­gle against the coro­n­avirus pan­demic, Prime Min­is­ter Muhyid­din Yassin’s gam­bit for what is ef­fec­tively po­lit­i­cal im­mu­nity has fallen short.</p>
    <p>He has re­mained in power since March de­spite hold­ing the slimmest ma­jor­ity in Malaysian his­tory, re­peat­edly ex­hibit­ing ex­tra­or­di­nary sur­vival in­stincts us­ing the full ex­tent of his ex­ec­u­tive au­thor­ity. But an emer­gency re­quest to en­large his pow­ers that would in­clude mak­ing laws and ap­prov­ing ex­pen­di­ture with­out par­lia­men­tary over­sight proved a bridge too far.</p>
    <p>Yet, the Parti Pribumi Ber­satu Malaysia pres­i­dent has not come out empty-handed de­spite yes­ter­day’s em­bar­rass­ment.</p>
    <p>The King may not have handed him an in­def­i­nite life­line, but Sultan Ab­dul­lah Ah­mad Shah has en­dorsed the Muhyid­din gov­ern­ment in a harsh re­buke of politi­cians who have “un­der­mined the sta­bil­ity of the na­tional ad­min­is­tra­tion”.</p>
    <p>The palace said the King “is of the opin­ion that there is no need for MPs to con­tinue with ir­re­spon­si­ble acts that can threaten the sta­bil­ity of the present gov­ern­ment”, and “His Majesty stresses that Bud­get 2021 that will be tabled in Par­lia­ment is of ex­treme im­por­tance to the public in ad­dress­ing the Covid-19 out­break and re­vi­tal­is­ing the na­tional economy”.</p>
    <p>It would seem that those com­ments were tar­geted at op­po­si­tion leader An­war Ibrahim, who ap­pears to be the front run­ner among pre­tenders to the pre­mier­ship, hav­ing re­peat­edly in­sisted in the past month that he has a “for­mi­da­ble ma­jor­ity”.</p>
    <p>An­other tar­get is likely Umno pres­i­dent Ah­mad Zahid Hamidi, who only re­cently back­tracked on threats to with­draw his party from Tan Sri Muhyid­din’s Perikatan Na­sional pact.</p>
    <p>“The blow to Muhyid­din was soft­ened by the King call­ing for a po­lit­i­cal cease­fire and an end to at­tempts at bring­ing down the gov­ern­ment; this slap­down seemed aimed at Pakatan Hara­pan leader An­war in par­tic­u­lar,” said risk con­sul­tancy Eura­sia Group’s Asia di­rec­tor Peter Mum­ford. “De­spite an au­di­ence with the King on Oct 13, An­war has yet to back up his claims to have a ma­jor­ity in Par­lia­ment and that he should thus be ap­pointed PM,” he added.</p>
    <p>Cou­pled with a call to set aside po­lit­i­cal dif­fer­ences to help the gov­ern­ment curb the coro­n­avirus pan­demic, the royal de­cree is be­ing viewed as a free pass for Mr Muhyid­din ahead of the up­com­ing par­lia­men­tary ses­sion that will span the last two months of the year.</p>
    <p>Ig­nor­ing the ad­vice of the revered roy­alty is widely seen as</p>
    <p>po­lit­i­cally costly. Al­ready, Parti Amanah Ne­gara pres­i­dent Mo­hamad Sabu has been ad­mon­ished by so­cial me­dia users as “trea­sonous” af­ter call­ing for the Premier to re­sign in a Twit­ter post­ing that the for­mer de­fence min­is­ter has since deleted.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, lead­ers of the largest op­po­si­tion party, the Demo­cratic Ac­tion Party, have now been fur­ther en­cour­aged to re­peat their of­fer to ne­go­ti­ate a con­fi­dence and sup­ply ar­range­ment in ex­change for con­ces­sions in the Bud­get.</p>
    <p>Still, an­a­lysts like Bow­erGroupAsi­a di­rec­tor Adib Zalka­pli see this as “ob­vi­ously a set­back for Muhyid­din”. The Premier had been con­fi­dent enough to sum­mon state chief</p>
    <p>min­is­ters for an early meet­ing to­day, even while Sultan Ab­dul­lah was still con­fer­ring with other state monar­chs yes­ter­day after­noon, only to can­cel the in­vite af­ter con­sent for the emer­gency was with­held.</p>
    <p>“It is as much a free pass as a de­cree to ne­go­ti­ate with the op­po­si­tion,” Mr Adib told The Straits Times.</p>
    <p>Fail­ure to reach a deal would open up the pos­si­bil­ity of Mr Muhyid­din fail­ing to get the ex­pen­di­ture for his gov­ern­ment ap­proved, re­sult­ing in its col­lapse. In a nor­mal sce­nario, this would ei­ther re­sult in snap polls or a new leader be­ing sworn in as premier.</p>
    <p>But with elec­tions in the midst of the deadly pan­demic the least</p>
    <p>favoured op­tion, and the King expressing plea­sure at the Muhyid­din ad­min­is­tra­tion’s han­dling of Covid-19, the word­ing of the re­fusal to de­clare an emer­gency be­comes per­ti­nent.</p>
    <p>“There is no need, for the time be­ing, for His Majesty to de­clare an emer­gency,” said royal comptrolle­r Ah­mad Fadil Sham­sud­din.</p>
    <p>Politi­cians op­posed to Mr Muhyid­din’s lead­er­ship would thus be wise to hold their fire for now, in­stead of hand­ing ammo to the em­bat­tled Premier to at­tempt a sec­ond swing for emer­gency pow­ers.</p>
    <p>When the virus is un­der con­trol, open sea­son can – and will – re­sume.</p>
