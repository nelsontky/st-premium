    <p>When the World Health Or­gan­i­sa­tion (WHO) de­clared Covid-19 a pandemic six months ago this week, it was a much smaller men­ace. There were about 118,000 cases across 114 coun­tries. Some 4,200 peo­ple had died, thou­sands more were fight­ing for their lives in hos­pi­tals. When declar­ing the pandemic, the first one ever caused by a coronaviru­s, the WHO reg­is­tered con­cern at its alarm­ing spread and sever­ity, and the dis­may­ing lev­els of in­ac­tion seen across the globe. At that point, more than 90 per cent of cases were in just four coun­tries. Two of those – China and South Korea, with over 80,000 and 7,000 cases each – had be­gun to record de­clines af­ter they en­acted ag­gres­sive re­sponses, while Italy and Iran were spi­ralling to­wards 10,000 cases each. To­day, the sweep of the virus is nearly univer­sal and has reached over 28 mil­lion cases – and count­ing – of which some 19 mil­lion have re­cov­ered, while deaths are ap­proach­ing the one-mil­lion mark.</p>
    <p>It has not been all gloom. The genome se­quence of the virus was ready within weeks; fast and ef­fec­tive tests are avail­able, while the quest for a vac­cine con­tin­ues with at least 35 promis­ing can­di­dates. There has been close col­lab­o­ra­tion within the world’s sci­en­tific com­mu­nity. Sci­ence pre­vailed even in theo­cratic na­tions which closed down places of wor­ship dur­ing lock­downs; reli­gious lead­ers did not con­test ad­vice that gather­ings were to be avoided. Govern­ments al­lo­cated tril­lions to pro­tect­ing the health of cit­i­zens and eas­ing eco­nomic and so­cial dis­rup­tions.</p>
    <p>Six months ago, the WHO stressed that the pandemic’s course could be changed if coun­tries tested, treated, traced and mo­bilised peo­ple to pre­vent cases turn­ing into chains of com­mu­nity trans­mis­sions. Some coun­tries strug­gled with a lack of ca­pac­ity, some faced a scarcity of re­sources, and oth­ers grap­pled with an ab­sence of po­lit­i­cal and so­cial re­solve. It is sober­ing that the prog­no­sis to­day is still no bet­ter amid a fresh wave of out­breaks. In Europe, in­fec­tion rates are ris­ing again, Is­rael has en­tered a sec­ond lock­down, and In­done­sia is reim­pos­ing tight an­tivirus mea­sures. Re­in­fec­tions have been re­ported, weak­en­ing hopes of last­ing im­mu­nity.</p>
    <p>What stands out to­day is an ab­sence of global lead­er­ship on the is­sue. The stew­ard­ship Wash­ing­ton showed dur­ing the Ebola cri­sis has been for­saken by Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump who chose to nar­row his con­cerns and shut the doors to the WHO, which he said pan­dered to China. China’s at­tempt at lead­er­ship has been clouded by doubts about its com­mer­cial or po­lit­i­cal mo­tives. Its ef­forts to pro­mote its ap­proaches to han­dling the out­break have been tied to its of­fers of aid. Su­per­power ri­valry has ob­scured the per­spec­tive that this is a global cri­sis that is in need of a more con­certed re­sponse. More lead­ers in the global com­mu­nity need to recog­nise that, and act now.</p>
