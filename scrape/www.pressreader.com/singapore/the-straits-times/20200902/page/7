        TOPOF THE NEWS A7 THE STRAITS TIMES WEDNESDAY, SEPTEMBER 2, 2020 | | | As a result, the sector continues to create new jobs, said Mr Ong. In fact, about 22,000 financial sector jobs were created over the past five years, with 15,000 going to Singaporea­ns.
Mr Ong said Singapore is now emerging as one of the nerve centres in the global financial system – sharing a stage with cities such as New York, London and Hong Kong – but it is a position that cannot be taken for granted.
He said: “So, this is not about growth at all costs, or accepting ‘trade-offs’ for the sake of growth, but about whether as a people, we can strengthen our place in the financial world, hold our own, develop the expertise, seize the opportunit­ies to make Singaporea­n lives better.” most would say yes,” Mr Ong added.
Still, there is more that can be done to create opportunit­ies for Singaporea­ns, he said. MAS is working with the industry to groom Singaporea­ns to be leaders and specialist­s in financial services through various schemes.
In his speech, Mr Ong traced Singapore’s journey in becoming a global financial hub, from bringing in new activities to developing new capabiliti­es and, where necessary, injecting into the sector foreign expertise – people with track records in the area.
But over time, when Singaporea­ns gain the expertise, they can take on more roles in multinatio­nal teams, in Singapore as well as abroad. The same approach is now being used in developing fintech and green finance, he said. mzlim@sph.com.sg 2 PRINTED AND DISTRIBUTE­D BY PRESSREADE­R PressReade­r.com +1 604 278 4604 ORIGINAL COPY .
