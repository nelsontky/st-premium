    <p>In­dia is gear­ing up for one of the big­gest vac­ci­na­tion drives in the world for Covid-19, with 300 mil­lion peo­ple ex­pected to re­ceive doses in the first phase last­ing till July.</p>
    <p>They will in­clude doc­tors, nurses and other front-line work­ers such as the po­lice and mu­nic­i­pal staff, and those above 65 years.</p>
    <p>The fed­eral health min­istry has re­leased guide­lines ask­ing that 100 peo­ple be vac­ci­nated a day at each vac­ci­na­tion cen­tre.</p>
    <p>With In­dia l ook­ing at half a dozen vac­cine can­di­dates, the fed­eral govern­ment is also en­cour­ag­ing states to choose one vac­cine per district, to sim­plify what is ex­pected to be a mam­moth ex­er­cise ri­valling how the coun­try of 1.35 bil­lion pre­pares for elec­tions.</p>
    <p>In­dian me­dia re­ported that health of­fi­cials are also look­ing at us­ing polling booths and wed­ding halls as vac­ci­na­tion cen­tres.</p>
    <p>The coun­try has yet to ap­prove any vac­cine for emer­gency roll­out.</p>
    <p>“The broad guide­lines have been shared with the states. Ori­en­ta­tion (for health work­ers and district of­fi­cials) and train­ing have started. States are now mov­ing to­wards ac­tion,” said Dr V. K. Paul, a mem­ber of the Na­tional In­sti­tu­tion for Trans­form­ing In­dia, the NITI Aayog, at a press con­fer­ence yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Mind­ful of a po­ten­tially grow­ing anti-vac­cine move­ment in In­dia, the govern­ment has started an aware­ness cam­paign to dis­pel doubts about the Covid-19 vac­cine.</p>
    <p>In a set of guide­lines re­leased last week, the fed­eral govern­ment asked states to en­sure “fac­tual and timely” in­for­ma­tion is shared with peo­ple to dis­pel ap­pre­hen­sion aris­ing from the short clin­i­cal tri­als, fear of ad­verse events, and mis­con­cep­tions and neg­a­tive ru­mours shared on so­cial me­dia.</p>
    <p>In­dia is the world’s sec­ond-worst af­fected coun­try af­ter the United States, with over 9.9 mil­lion coron­avirus cases.</p>
    <p>Cases have spiked in dif­fer­ent parts of the coun­try although over­all num­bers have been fall­ing over the past few weeks. Fewer than 22,100 new cases were regis­tered on Mon­day, com­pared with more than 90,000 cases per day in midSeptem­ber.</p>
    <p>So far, three groups have ap­plied for emer­gency ap­proval, in­clud­ing</p>
    <p>Pfizer, the Serum In­sti­tute of In­dia for the Ox­ford-As­traZeneca vac­cine, and Bharat Biotech for its Co­vaxin. Govern­ment of­fi­cials said the Drugs Con­troller-Gen­eral of In­dia was ex­am­in­ing the three vac­cines for emer­gency use.</p>
    <p>This week, the con­troller gave clear­ance for clin­i­cal tri­als for one more can­di­date, by Gen­nova Phar­ma­ceu­ti­cals, which is based in the city of Pune, in as­so­ci­a­tion with In­dia’s De­part­ment of Biotech­nol­ogy, Dr Paul said.</p>
    <p>One chal­lenge fac­ing the roll-out is whether ca­pac­i­ties like cold stor­age can be ramped up within the short time­frame.</p>
    <p>How­ever, ex­perts noted that the South Asian coun­try’s abil­ity to han­dle large num­bers dur­ing rou­tine im­mu­ni­sa­tion would help.</p>
    <p>“This is an in­cred­i­bly com­plex oper­a­tion for any coun­try, par­tic­u­larly given In­dia’s size and diver­sity... There’s cer­tainly po­ten­tial for a plethora of ques­tions and con­cerns both among health­care staff as well as com­mu­nity mem­bers; the im­por­tance of and need to pay at­ten­tion to com­mu­ni­ca­tion strate­gies can­not be overem­pha­sised,” said Pro­fes­sor Ra­jib Das­gupta, chair­man of the Cen­tre of So­cial Medicine and Com­mu­nity Health at Jawa­har­lal Nehru Univer­sity.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to a study by the Fed­er­a­tion of In­dian Chambers of Com­merce & In­dus­try and Ernst & Young, In­dia needs an es­ti­mated 130,000 to 140,000 vac­ci­na­tion cen­tres, 100,000 health­care pro­fes­sion­als to carry out the in­oc­u­la­tions, and 200,000 vol­un­teers.</p>
    <p>The study noted govern­ment fa­cil­i­ties could be fur­ther aug­mented by the pri­vate sec­tor in states with weaker health in­fra­struc­ture like Odisha, Bi­har, Jhark­hand, West Ben­gal, Ut­tar Pradesh and Mad­hya Pradesh.</p>
    <p>For now, the plan looks good – on pa­per.</p>
    <p>“The govern­ment is well pre­pared in prac­ti­cal terms but I ex­pect many a slip be­tween the cup and lip,” noted epi­demi­ol­o­gist T. Ja­cob John, who said many ques­tions would arise, in­clud­ing over the choice of ben­e­fi­cia­ries.</p>
