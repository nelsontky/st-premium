    <p>In­dia now has more recorded Covid-19 cases than Brazil, and stands be­hind only the United States on that count. Whereas the num­ber of new cases in the US and Brazil is ta­per­ing off, In­dia’s con­tin­ues to mount. On a sin­gle day, these days, more cases are be­ing recorded than the en­tire caseload of China, where the highly con­ta­gious dis­ease was first re­ported. Worse, the coro­n­avirus has now moved from ur­ban ar­eas and into the vast hin­ter­land where the ma­jor­ity of In­di­ans live in con­di­tions that can only be de­scribed as un­der­served by health sys­tems. The true num­ber, there­fore, may not be known with cer­tainty. The death count is close to 72,000. At this pace, In­dia’s Covid-re­lated deaths may ex­ceed the 230,000 peo­ple who died across 14 coun­tries in the 2004 tsunami. What is un­fold­ing is a ver­i­ta­ble hu­man­i­tar­ian dis­as­ter of epic pro­por­tions.</p>
    <p>Years of in­ad­e­quate spend­ing on pub­lic health and ed­u­ca­tion are com­ing home to roost. The mor­tal­ity rate, cur­rently at about 1.8 per thou­sand af­fected, would prob­a­bly have been higher were it not for the fact that the coun­try has a size­able young pop­u­la­tion. The me­dian age is about 27, thus help­ing it es­cape some of the rav­ages seen, for in­stance, in places like Europe where there is a high num­ber of vul­ner­a­ble older peo­ple. The pan­demic has now been fol­lowed by a se­cu­rity cri­sis on the China bor­der. Adding to the per­fect storm, the virus has dev­as­tated an econ­omy that was al­ready in bad shape. Gross do­mes­tic prod­uct shrank by al­most a quar­ter in the three months that ended in June com­pared with a year ear­lier.</p>
    <p>Given that China flagged the se­ri­ous­ness of the Covid sit­u­a­tion when it im­posed a lock­down on Wuhan and other Hubei cities on Jan 23, it would have been pru­dent for coun­tries like In­dia to have been more vig­i­lant in safe­guard­ing them­selves. While it be­gan sur­veil­lance in Jan­uary, it was not un­til March 24 that New Delhi im­posed a na­tional lock­down. When it did so, it ap­peared to have acted in haste. Mil­lions of mi­grant work­ers were sud­denly out of work and stranded in the cities, des­per­ately seek­ing a way to get home to their vil­lages hun­dreds of miles away. Faced with an eco­nomic catas­tro­phe, In­dia is now go­ing the other way and steadily eas­ing the lock­down.</p>
    <p>Per­haps it has no choice. Not want­ing out­side help – and given the cir­cum­stances, the ca­pac­ity of other na­tions to step in with aid is in doubt – this is a sit­u­a­tion it now has to face alone. It is un­clear, given the state of the health sys­tem and the ab­sence of a cred­i­ble vac­cine, whether some form of herd im­mu­nity can pro­tect the pop­u­la­tion. A study by the Tata In­sti­tute of Fun­da­men­tal Re­search sug­gests that 75 per cent of Mumbai slum dwellers will carry an­ti­bod­ies by De­cem­ber. Rus­sia, mean­while, is in talks with New Delhi for co­pro­duc­tion of its Sput­nik V vac­cine. That at least pro­vides some hope for it on the horizon.</p>
