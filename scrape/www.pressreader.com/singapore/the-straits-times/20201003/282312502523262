    <p>PwC’s re­port said health and biotech start-ups have gar­nered greater at­ten­tion from in­vestors, par­tic­u­larly given the Covid-19 pan­demic. These com­pa­nies raised $342 mil­lion be­tween Jan­uary and June, which ex­ceeded the $230 mil­lion in­jected for the whole of last year.</p>
    <p>Fund­ing for tech­nol­ogy start-ups has been en­cour­ag­ing for the first half of the year de­spite the coro­n­avirus pan­demic, ac­cord­ing to a re­port by pro­fes­sional ser­vice firm Price Water­house Coop­ers (PwC).</p>
    <p>Ride-hail­ing com­pany Grab and lo­gis­tics business Ninja Van were among the best per­form­ers as star­tups raised a to­tal of about $3.3 bil­lion dur­ing this pe­riod, more than half of the $6.5 bil­lion of fund­ing gar­nered for the whole of last year.</p>
    <p>The t wo com­pa­nies are the poster boys for the ur­ban so­lu­tions and sus­tain­abil­ity sec­tor, which con­tin­ues to at­tract the most at­ten­tion from in­vestors.</p>
    <p>The re­port, re­leased on Wed­nes­day, said the sec­tor drew $1.89 bil­lion i n fund­ing i n the first six months, un­der­pinned by Grab’s $1.2 bil­lion raised from Toy­ota Mo­tor Corp in Fe­bru­ary and Ninja Van’s near $400 mil­lion from in­vestors such as Face­book co-founder Ed­uardo Saverin’s B Cap­i­tal.</p>
    <p>PwC Sin­ga­pore’s Ven­ture Hub leader Pa­trick Yeo said: “The Covid-19 cri­sis has dis­rupted fund rais­ing i n Sin­ga­pore’s start-up ecosys­tem, but we will con­tinue to see in­vest­ments com­ing in this year and ahead.</p>
    <p>“We be­lieve there are sig­nif­i­cant op­por­tu­ni­ties in Sin­ga­pore with high-growth in­no­va­tive com­pa­nies for in­vestors to con­sider.”</p>
    <p>The re­port noted that Sin­ga­pore saw a slide in tech start-up fund­ing last year, with in­vestors turn­ing more cau­tious and fo­cus­ing more on business fun­da­men­tals and cash gen­er­a­tion in­stead of mea­sures of growth po­ten­tial such as the to­tal value of goods sold.</p>
    <p>In com­par­i­son, start-ups raised more than $10 bil­lion in 2018.</p>
    <p>In­vestors were also seen to be more de­mand­ing at the start of this year, look­ing for cheaper val­u­a­tions and deals of smaller quanta.</p>
    <p>This led to fewer deals and fewer large deals be­ing struck, PwC said.</p>
    <p>Pro­fes­sor Wong Poh Kam of the Na­tional Univer­sity of Sin­ga­pore Business School pointed out that while the fund­ing fig­ures look to be on a par with last year’s, the im­pact of the Covid-19 out­break on deals may not have been as ap­par­ent in the first half of this year, as the dealmaking process spans sev­eral months and may have be­gun be­fore the virus struck.</p>
    <p>“The ef­fect will be more ob­vi­ous in the sec­ond half of the year, and there will prob­a­bly be a slow­down in at least the num­ber of deals,” he said.</p>
    <p>He added that the pan­demic would have af­fected how ven­ture cap­i­tal firms carry out their due dili­gence be­fore mak­ing their in­vest­ments.</p>
    <p>Still, such firms have ready cap­i­tal on hand, and there could be an in­crease in the size of fund­ing even if the num­ber of deals falls, Prof Wong said.</p>
    <p>PwC’s re­port said health and biotech start-ups have gar­nered greater at­ten­tion from in­vestors, par­tic­u­larly given the Covid-19 pan­demic. These com­pa­nies raised $342 mil­lion be­tween Jan­uary and June, ex­ceed­ing the $230 mil­lion in­jected for the whole of last year.</p>
    <p>Fin­tech also con­tin­ues to be a strong­hold in the Re­pub­lic’s startup ecosys­tem, with about $400 mil­lion in­vested in start-ups in this do­main in the first half of the year.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, the ur­ban so­lu­tions and sus­tain­abil­ity seg­ment looks to con­tinue its run as an in­vestors’ dar­ling.</p>
    <p>“In terms of re­new­able en­er­gies, in­no­va­tions in biomass, bioen­ergy and so­lar also have mas­sive growth po­ten­tial, as Asia is pro­jected to ac­count for 64 per cent of the global in­crease in re­new­able en­ergy ca­pac­i­ties by 2040,” said Mr Hau Koh Foo, di­rec­tor of the Sin­ga­pore Man­age­ment Univer­sity’s In­sti­tute of In­no­va­tion and En­trepreneur­ship.</p>
    <p>A spokesman for the Ac­tion Com­mu­nity for En­trepreneur­ship said in­vestors are more cau­tious about de­ploy­ing their funds into start-ups dur­ing this pan­demic pe­riod, when re­cov­ery is uncer­tain.</p>
    <p>“Start-ups should en­sure that they can sur­vive with­out eq­uity fi­nanc­ing and in­stead source... the best cap­i­tal – cus­tomers who buy their ser­vices and prod­ucts.</p>
    <p>“In­vestors will con­tinue to back com­pa­nies that have mar­ket de­mand,” he said.</p>
