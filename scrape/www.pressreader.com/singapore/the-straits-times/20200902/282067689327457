    <p>It is time to re­view Sin­ga­pore’s for­eign labour pol­icy and see if the coun­try can be­come less de­pen­dent on for­eign work­ers, said Mr Liang Eng Hwa (Bukit Pan­jang).</p>
    <p>For years, for­eign work­ers have helped fuel Sin­ga­pore’s progress and com­plete large-scale in­fra­struc­ture projects. How­ever, two ma­jor events have made clear the need for a re­view, he said.</p>
    <p>First is the Covid-19 out­break in for­eign worker dor­mi­to­ries, when thou­sands of for­eign work­ers were in­fected with the coro­n­avirus, and which high­lighted “unan­tic­i­pated costs” in Sin­ga­pore’s re­liance on for­eign labour, said Mr Liang.</p>
    <p>The se­cond event, he added, was the Lit­tle In­dia riot in 2013.</p>
    <p>De­spite mea­sures taken af­ter the two events, more can still be done to re­duce de­pen­dence on for­eign labour, he said.</p>
    <p>On the se­cond day of the de­bate on the Pres­i­dent’s Ad­dress in Par­lia­ment yes­ter­day, Mr Liang was among sev­eral MPs who fo­cused on Sin­ga­pore’s for­eign labour poli­cies and the is­sues that lo­cal work­ers face in a tight labour mar­ket.</p>
    <p>There is a need for for­eign labour in sec­tors like con­struc­tion but more must be done to im­prove pro­duc­tiv­ity, he said.</p>
    <p>For the con­struc­tion sec­tor, the Govern­ment can en­cour­age pro­duc­tiv­ity, for in­stance, by award­ing ten­ders to firms that use pro­duc­tive con­struc­tion meth­ods, and rely less on for­eign work­ers.</p>
    <p>De­mand for for­eign labour can also be re­duced by be­ing more “dis­cern­ing” about ma­jor con­struc­tion projects, Mr Liang said.</p>
    <p>For ex­am­ple, it is waste­ful to de­mol­ish build­ings that are in good con­di­tion only to re­place them with sim­i­lar build­ings, as in the case of some col­lec­tive sale de­vel­op­ments, he added.</p>
    <p>He also asked if it was nec­es­sary to pro­ceed with plans to build Changi Air­port’s Ter­mi­nal 5, es­pe­cially when air travel is in the dol­drums due to the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Said Mr Liang: “Are the risks now too high to go ahead with this mas­sive in­vest­ment?</p>
    <p>“Can we work within our ex­ist­ing four ter­mi­nals, re­gen­er­ate new value propo­si­tions and op­ti­mise what we al­ready have with the ter­mi­nals and the set-up?”</p>
    <p>Mr Liang said he wel­comed last week’s news that the min­i­mum qual­i­fy­ing salaries for Em­ploy­ment Pass (EP) hold­ers will be in­creased.</p>
    <p>To com­ple­ment this, Sin­ga­pore needs to max­imise the po­ten­tial of its lo­cal work­force, he added.</p>
    <p>Ms Tin Pei Ling (MacPher­son) made sim­i­lar sug­ges­tions when she called for more fo­cused ef­forts to nur­ture the soft skills of lo­cal work­ers.</p>
    <p>These i nclude l ead­er­ship and com­mu­ni­ca­tion skills, which are “in­valu­able” com­pared with pa­per qual­i­fi­ca­tions, and greater em­pha­sis must be placed on them.</p>
    <p>Said Ms Tin: “Most busi­nesses place con­sid­er­able value on the abil­ity to ar­tic­u­late thoughts and ideas clearly, to com­mu­ni­cate ef­fec­tively and demon­strate will­ing­ness to col­lab­o­rate and work as a team.”</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore’s ed­u­ca­tion sys­tem</p>
    <p>Most busi­nesses place con­sid­er­able value on the abil­ity to ar­tic­u­late thoughts and ideas clearly, to com­mu­ni­cate ef­fec­tively and demon­strate will­ing­ness to col­lab­o­rate and work as a team. needs to make sure its cit­i­zens re­main the pre­ferred choice of em­ploy­ers by cul­ti­vat­ing these skills, and the Govern­ment should for­mu­late a plan to groom young adults in the lo­cal work­force for po­ten­tial lead­er­ship po­si­tions, she added.</p>
    <p>Em­ploy­ers, too, can do their part by mak­ing clear their ex­pec­ta­tions of cor­po­rate lead­ers and hav­ing a frame­work iden­ti­fy­ing key cri­te­ria, be­hav­iours and at­ti­tudes needed at var­i­ous lev­els of man­age­ment, said Ms Tin.</p>
    <p>This way, Sin­ga­pore­ans can be clear about what they have to do to get pro­moted, she added.</p>
    <p>Cases where a lo­cal pro­fes­sional is passed over for a for­eigner have given rise to com­plaints about dis­crim­i­na­tion, said Ms Joan Pereira (Tan­jong Pa­gar GRC).</p>
    <p>She cited an anec­dote about one of her res­i­dents who was re­placed by a for­eigner af­ter get­ting re­trenched.</p>
    <p>Ms Pereira urged the Govern­ment to do more to pre­vent such hir­ing bi­ases, and said that while she sup­ported in­creas­ing the qual­i­fy­ing salaries for EP hold­ers, this was not enough. She sug­gested im­prov­ing hot­lines to make it eas­ier for whis­tle-blow­ers to re­port such prac­tices.</p>
    <p>The Govern­ment should also adopt a con­sul­ta­tive process to work more closely with em­ploy­ers to find out what dif­fi­cul­ties they face in hir­ing lo­cal work­ers, and work through these is­sues in a con­struc­tive man­ner, she said.</p>
