    <p>• Will there be a new Bel­gian princess?</p>
    <p>A court in Belgium will rule next month on what rights and ti­tles can be granted to Ms Del­phine Boel, re­cently recog­nised as the daugh­ter of for­mer Bel­gian King Al­bert II af­ter a DNA test he was forced to take.</p>
    <p>The Brus­sels ap­peals court, which last Thurs­day heard lawyers on both sides, must still for­mally es­tab­lish this di­rect line of des­cent and its le­gal ram­i­fi­ca­tions.</p>
    <p>Ms Boel wants t he ti­tle of princess of Belgium, but Al­bert II is against it, their lawyers said.</p>
    <p>The court will rule on the is­sue on Oct 29, a spokesman told Agence France-Presse.</p>
    <p>A 52-year-old artist, Ms Boel was born from Al­bert II’s af­fair of nearly 20 years with Bel­gian aris­to­crat Sy­bille de Selys Longchamps. At the time, he was heir to the throne and mar­ried since 1959 to the fu­ture Queen Paola.</p>
    <p>He went on to reign from 1993 to 2013, when he handed the crown to his son Philippe.</p>
    <p>Since 1999, the year a jour­nal­ist re­vealed the ex­is­tence of Al­bert II’s se­cret daugh­ter, the king had al­ways de­nied his pa­ter­nity – even though he had been in con­tact with her when she was a child.</p>
    <p>But then a court or­dered a DNA test and levied a fine of €5,000 (S$8,100) a day for each day he re­fused.</p>
    <p>In Jan­uary, the 86-year-old Al­bert II fi­nally ac­knowl­edged that he was Ms Boel’s fa­ther af­ter the DNA test came back pos­i­tive.</p>
    <p>Her lawyer, Mr Marc Uyt­ten­daele, told re­porters last Thurs­day that she wants to have the same “rights and ti­tles” as her three sib­lings, Philippe, Lau­rent and Astrid.</p>
    <p>That in­cludes be­ing given the ti­tle “princess of Belgium”.</p>
    <p>But Mr Alain Beren­boom, Al­bert II’s lawyer, said that the ti­tle was usu­ally granted by royal de­cree, and that it is not up to a court to de­cide.</p>
