    <p>The sooth­ing sounds of spa mu­sic greet you as you walk into PPIS Bukit Ba­tok. As­sem­bled in so­cially dis­tanced rows, six Kinder­garten 1 chil­dren pre­pare for their na­ture yoga les­son.</p>
    <p>“Once upon a time, there lived a lonely frog,” says the teacher, in­struct­ing them to put up their hands as if start­ing a sun salu­ta­tion. They then as­sume a squat po­si­tion on the floor, just like the frog.</p>
    <p>“Close your eyes and re­lax,” she says, slowly count­ing to 10. “Breathe in, breathe out.”</p>
    <p>The stu­dents adopt dif­fer­ent yoga poses in tan­dem with her story, flap­ping their “wings” in but­ter­fly poses and reach­ing up with their arms while bal­anc­ing on one leg in a tree pose.</p>
    <p>Pre-Covid-19, chil­dren at the cen­tre ven­tured out­doors on reg­u­lar na­ture treks – the cen­tre is close to Bukit Ba­tok Na­ture Park – and did their na­ture yoga dur­ing such trips. Now, the 10-minute yoga lessons are con­ducted in class­rooms.</p>
    <p>This helps the kids build mind­ful­ness, says Madam Zu­lai­habe Talip, as­sis­tant head of op­er­a­tions (PPIS Preschool De­vel­op­ment).</p>
    <p>“The idea is to get them mov­ing such that they are able to pay at­ten­tion to their body and breath­ing. These prac­tices of tak­ing mo­ments to pause, breathe and re­flect teach them how to con­trol their own re­ac­tions and man­age stress.”</p>
    <p>The set-up of ta­bles and chairs you find in most pre-schools is de­lib­er­ately ab­sent. The cen­tre fol­lows a Reg­gio Emilia-in­spired curriculum, named af­ter the Italian town that founded it, which be­lieves in child-led learn­ing and that the en­vi­ron­ment is a child’s third teacher, to­gether with par­ents and teach­ers.</p>
    <p>Kid-friendly spa­ces in­vite dis­cov­ery, from an in­ven­tion cor­ner with a mini pro­jec­tor and lap­top, to low wooden crates topped with trays of loose ma­te­ri­als such as clean egg shells, and pieces of cork and twigs, where chil­dren can ex­plore and in­vent.</p>
    <p>The light-filled class­rooms, sooth­ing pal­ette of colours and nat­u­ral ma­te­ri­als echo what you would nor­mally find in higher-end pre-schools that fol­low the same ped­a­gogy, but par­ents here pay a more af­ford­able $727.60 a month for full-day child­care.</p>
    <p>An­other PPIS cen­tre in Jurong West Street 91 also of­fers the same Reg­gio-in­spired ap­proach and the plan is to ex­tend this even­tu­ally to all its seven cen­tres.</p>
    <p>At a cosy space on the ground floor la­belled the Pi­azza, kids can hone their mo­tor skills by nav­i­gat­ing an ob­sta­cle course, make mu­sic by bang­ing spoons on bis­cuit tins and whip up “meals” at a play kitchen. It is meant to be “a place where chil­dren come in, dis­cuss and bounce ideas”, says Madam Anizah Mo­ham­mad Saleh, head of Qual­ity As­sur­ance & Train­ing (PPIS Preschool De­vel­op­ment).</p>
    <p>Up­stairs, a group of chil­dren play in a des­ig­nated space la­belled Kam­pung Bukit Ba­tok, which cel­e­brates Malay her­itage and cul­ture. One pre­tends to sail a sam­pan, an­other col­lects “eggs” from a chicken coop, while yet an­other tin­kles with tra­di­tional mu­si­cal in­stru­ments.</p>
    <p>The school’s her­itage cen­tre won the Na­tional Her­itage Board’s School Her­itage Cham­pion Award in 2017.</p>
    <p>The Reg­gio phi­los­o­phy has fired up its ed­u­ca­tors to em­brace a new way of teach­ing that sees them not as tra­di­tional in­struc­tors but fa­cil­i­ta­tors who can help kids un­leash their hid­den po­ten­tial.</p>
    <p>“Chil­dren can do so much; we can learn from them,” says Madam Zu­lai­habe, who was among a group of staff who vis­ited Reg­gio Emilia last year to learn more about its teach­ing phi­los­o­phy.</p>
    <p>Teach­ers fa­cil­i­tate learn­ing by en­gag­ing kids through what are called provo­ca­tions, she says. These are projects that stim­u­late their ini­tia­tive and imag­i­na­tion.</p>
    <p>In this way, they build up an “in­quiry-based mind, so they start ask­ing ques­tions, they want to do things and it builds their con­fi­dence”, she adds.</p>
