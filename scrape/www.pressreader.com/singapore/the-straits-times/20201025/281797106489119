    <p>The Min­istry of Health noted that TB is typ­i­cally spread through close and pro­longed con­tact with an in­fec­tious in­di­vid­ual, and not by con­tact with items or sur­faces touched by an in­fected per­son. Those con­tacted and screened typ­i­cally are fam­ily mem­bers, close work­place col­leagues and ac­quain­tances from com­mon so­cial ac­tiv­i­ties with close, reg­u­lar in­ter­ac­tion.</p>
    <p>Cur­rent and for­mer res­i­dents of Block 174D Hougang Av­enue 1 will be of­fered vol­un­tary screen­ing for tu­ber­cu­lo­sis (TB) fol­low­ing the de­tec­tion of a clus­ter of cases in the block, said the Min­istry of Health (MOH) yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>MOH de­scribed the move as a pre­cau­tion­ary mea­sure af­ter four in­di­vid­u­als re­sid­ing in four dif­fer­ent units at the block were di­ag­nosed with the disease.</p>
    <p>The screen­ing will be con­ducted free of charge at the Tu­ber­cu­lo­sis Con­trol Unit in Moul­mein Road from to­mor­row.</p>
    <p>MOH was no­ti­fied on Oct 10 of the four cases, who were di­ag­nosed be­tween Jan­uary 2018 and June this year.</p>
    <p>The min­istry noted that all four im­me­di­ately started treat­ment fol­low­ing di­ag­no­sis. Two have com­pleted treat­ment, while the other two are cur­rently un­der­go­ing treat­ment and are no longer in­fec­tious.</p>
    <p>“As in­di­vid­u­als di­ag­nosed with tu­ber­cu­lo­sis will rapidly be­come non­in­fec­tious once treat­ment starts, the cases are not an on­go­ing pub­lic health risk,” MOH said.</p>
    <p>Con­tact in­ves­ti­ga­tions were ini­ti­ated upon no­ti­fi­ca­tion of the cases and close con­tacts have al­ready been iden­ti­fied and con­tacted for screen­ing. In­ves­ti­ga­tions into the four cases at the time of di­ag­no­sis did not iden­tify them as close con­tacts, MOH said.</p>
    <p>“The clus­ter was sub­se­quently de­ter­mined due to the re­sults of the ge­netic se­quenc­ing per­formed in Oc­to­ber as part of ret­ro­spec­tive test­ing of tu­ber­cu­lo­sis cases to de­ter­mine pos­si­ble link­ages,” the min­istry added.</p>
    <p>“This re­vealed that all four cases have sim­i­lar ge­netic make-up. In­ves­ti­ga­tions into the cases did not re­veal any com­mon links, other than that they live in the same block.</p>
    <p>“They did not know or in­ter­act with one an­other, or con­gre­gate at the same com­mon ar­eas, and had also not iden­ti­fied each other as close con­tacts. The clus­ter there­fore does not fit the usual pat­tern of tu­ber­cu­lo­sis spread.”</p>
    <p>MOH noted that TB is typ­i­cally spread through close and pro­longed con­tact with an in­fec­tious in­di­vid­ual, and not by con­tact with items or sur­faces touched by an in­fected per­son.</p>
    <p>Those con­tacted and screened typ­i­cally are fam­ily mem­bers, close work­place col­leagues and ac­quain­tances from com­mon so­cial ac­tiv­i­ties with close, reg­u­lar in­ter­ac­tion.</p>
    <p>“The ex­panded tu­ber­cu­lo­sis screen­ing of­fered by MOH is a pre­cau­tion­ary mea­sure to as­sure and pro­tect res­i­dents liv­ing in the same block. The ex­er­cise could help de­tect any un­di­ag­nosed cases.”</p>
    <p>The screen­ing is not com­pul­sory but is strongly en­cour­aged.</p>
    <p>Those with ac­tive TB will be treated im­me­di­ately and those with la­tent non-in­fec­tious TB will be mon­i­tored and treated if nec­es­sary.</p>
    <p>MOH also noted that the risk of trans­mis­sion to peo­ple who are not close con­tacts of a case is very low, which means screen­ing is also not nec­es­sary for in­di­vid­u­als who had oc­ca­sion­ally vis­ited the block or vicin­ity.</p>
    <p>Of­fi­cers from the Tu­ber­cu­lo­sis Con­trol Unit and the Na­tional Cen­tre for In­fec­tious Dis­eases will also be con­duct­ing house vis­its to all units at the af­fected block be­tween to­day and Tues­day.</p>
    <p>Res­i­dents will be able to make ap­point­ments for the screen­ing dur­ing the house vis­its.</p>
    <p>They can also call the Tu­ber­cu­lo­sis Con­trol Unit to make an ap­point­ment for screen­ing.</p>
    <p>For­mer res­i­dents who lived in the block from Fe­bru­ary this year and wish to be screened may call the Tu­ber­cu­lo­sis Con­trol Unit hot­line on 6248-4430.</p>
