    <p>Dig­i­tal pay­ments in In­dia reg­is­tered sig­nif­i­cant growth in re­cent months amid the Covid-19 pan­demic, a trend likely to be fur­ther re­in­forced with the launch of a pay­ment fa­cil­ity on What­sApp ear­lier this month.</p>
    <p>The num­ber of Uni­fied Pay­ments In­ter­face-based (UPI-based) pay­ments hit a new mile­stone in In­dia with more than two bil­lion trans­ac­tions last month, gov­ern­ment data showed. The Na­tional Pay­ments Cor­po­ra­tion of In­dia (NPCI) val­ued the trans­ac­tions at 3.86 tril­lion rupees (S$70 bil­lion).</p>
    <p>The UPI is a pop­u­lar in­stant re­al­time pay­ment sys­tem de­vel­oped by NPCI to fa­cil­i­tate in­ter-bank trans­ac­tions. Traf­fic on the plat­form has jumped from 1.31 bil­lion trans­ac­tions val­ued at 2.16 tril­lion rupees in Jan­uary, when In­dia re­ported its first Covid-19 case.</p>
    <p>This trend re­ceived a fur­ther fil­lip on Nov 6, when What­sApp rolled out its UPI-re­liant pay­ment ser­vice in In­dia the day after re­ceiv­ing ap­proval from NPCI.</p>
    <p>While Face­book has been test­ing pay­ments on What­sApp in In­dia since 2018, a full roll-out was de­layed by con­cerns over data stor­age and shar­ing.</p>
    <p>The launch comes after Face­book in­vested US$5.7 bil­lion (S$7.6 bil­lion) for a 9.99 per cent stake in In­dian bil­lion­aire Mukesh Am­bani’s dig­i­tal ser­vices firm, Jio Plat­forms, in April. Face­book’s ser­vice joins a mar­ket dom­i­nated by other in­ter­na­tional play­ers and their pay­ment apps such as Google (Google Pay), Wal­mart (PhonePe) and Ama­zon (Ama­zon Pay).</p>
    <p>Mr Pran­jal Kamra, chief ex­ec­u­tive and founder of Fi­nol­ogy, a fi­nan­cial ad­vi­sory firm that re­lies on on­line pay­ments for its ser­vices, said the abil­ity to trans­act fi­nan­cially on What­sApp will fur­ther democra­tise dig­i­tal trans­ac­tions be­cause of its wide user base that also in­cludes the el­derly, who have so far mostly stayed away from stand­alone pay­ment apps.</p>
    <p>He gave the ex­am­ple of In­sta­gram Sto­ries-like fea­tures that al­low users of var­i­ous apps to share con­tent tem­po­rar­ily with oth­ers – some­thing that is still rel­a­tively un­known among the el­derly. “But after it came to What­sApp (via What­sApp Sta­tus), even mid­dle-aged and el­derly peo­ple are now com­fort­able with such a fea­ture across plat­forms,” he told The Straits Times.</p>
    <p>“I see a sim­i­lar thing hap­pen­ing now be­cause UPI is avail­able on What­sApp. A lot of peo­ple will sud­denly try it out, specif­i­cally peo­ple above 50 who are still re­luc­tant to use stand­alone dig­i­tal trans­ac­tion apps,” he added.</p>
    <p>The NPCI has, how­ever, placed an ini­tial limit on the num­ber of users What­sApp can ex­pand its ser­vice to at 20 mil­lion. What­sApp has more than 400 mil­lion users in In­dia. NPCI has also placed a cap to en­sure that no sin­gle pay­ments app pro­cesses more than 30 per cent of to­tal UPI trans­ac­tions.</p>
    <p>Pro­mot­ing dig­i­tal trans­ac­tions has been a pri­or­ity for the cur­rent gov­ern­ment in its ef­fort to re­duce cor­rup­tion. While de­mon­eti­sa­tion in 2016 gave an ini­tial push to dig­i­tal pay­ments in the coun­try, the pan­demic has seen this trend ex­pand sig­nif­i­cantly.</p>
    <p>“The real driver was the lock­down and the move away from cash, seen as dirty and po­ten­tially a carrier, to a con­tact­less ecosys</p>
    <p>tem,” Mr Prasanto K. Roy, a Del­hibased public pol­icy con­sul­tant, told The Straits Times over e-mail.</p>
    <p>“Gro­ceries and food de­liv­er­ies went con­tact­less, the pop­u­lar and once-dom­i­nant cash-on-de­liv­ery for e-com­merce van­ished and pre­paid took over, restau­rants on­boarded con­tact­less din­ing – and back­ing all this up were con­tact­less pay­ments,” he added.</p>
    <p>The NPCI in Au­gust also launched UPI Au­toPay to en­able au­to­matic debit for re­cur­ring pay­ments on the plat­form, which will fur­ther fa­cil­i­tate dig­i­tal pay­ments for fre­quently used ser­vices like mu­tual funds and loan re­pay­ments, metro fares and elec­tric­ity bills, among oth­ers. This is im­por­tant in a coun­try where dig­i­tal pay­ments are largely mo­bile-driven.</p>
    <p>Such trans­ac­tions are ex­pected to grow tre­men­dously, said Mr Roy, with a lot of ground still left to cover among those in­cluded in the for­mal bank­ing struc­ture. Many of those who have re­cently opened bank ac­counts un­der the Prad­han Mantri Jan-Dhan Yo­jana, a gov­ern­ment pro­gramme to im­prove ac­cess to in­sti­tu­tional fi­nan­cial ser­vices, are not spend­ing their money dig­i­tally, he said.</p>
    <p>An es­ti­mated 190 mil­lion peo­ple also still re­main un­banked in In­dia. More­over, there are emerg­ing prob­lems that could slow the growth of dig­i­tal pay­ments, such as those around lack of cy­ber se­cu­rity as well as in­ad­e­quate in­fra­struc­ture to sup­port grow­ing on­line pay­ments. “An ex­plo­sion of phish­ing frauds and scams in 2020 is shak­ing the con­fi­dence of new users,” said Mr Roy.</p>
