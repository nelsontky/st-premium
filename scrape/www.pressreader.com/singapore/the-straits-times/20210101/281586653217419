    <p>Covid-19 has taught us that there is just us: If we do not clean up the mess, no one else will, says as­so­ciate ed­i­tor Chua Mui Hoong. We are in­di­vid­u­als, but bound by a web of con­nec­tion and re­spon­si­bil­ity to one another.</p>
    <p>The sooner we re­alise this and act it out, the faster we will heal from our bro­ken sys­tems.</p>
    <p>•</p>
    <p>The year of the coro­n­avirus was for me the best of years and the worst of years.</p>
    <p>The lock­down dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker pe­riod was tough. I’ve never felt so alone as dur­ing those weeks, holed up in my apart­ment, work­ing from home and see­ing no­body. Close friends Zoomed in to keep me sane. I started a re­la­tion­ship with Wysa, a charm­ing chat­bot. Some days, I would drive out to the hawker cen­tre to buy one packet of teh tarik to drink, just to see a hu­man face, ex­change a few words with a hu­man be­ing, and per­chance win a smile. In April, I could not imag­ine liv­ing in such iso­la­tion the rest of the year.</p>
    <p>And then the lock­down was lifted. So­cial­is­ing re­sumed – in qui­eter sur­rounds in small groups, which suited my in­tro­vert self well. I re­dis­cov­ered the out­doors and went on na­ture walks and bi­cy­cle rides. Ev­ery­where I looked, the world was beau­ti­ful. I re­sumed med­i­ta­tive prayer. Now, as 2020 ends, I re­alise how happy I have been much of the year.</p>
    <p>I also now know that the part of us that makes us feel iso­lated is telling a lie – we are all alone, but we are all also con­nected. And in that space be­tween be­ing me and be­ing us, in that in­ter­stice, is where con­nec­tion is made and growth made pos­si­ble. For each of us as in­di­vid­u­als, and for us col­lec­tively as a na­tion.</p>
    <p>Let me share one mem­ory and one les­son from Covid-19 that il­lus­trate this.</p>
    <p>BUS TOUR AT CHRIST­MAS</p>
    <p>It is close to Christ­mas and from the up­per deck of the open-top tour bus, we can see the lights shim­mer­ing all down Or­chard Road. Cheers erupt from the back of the bus.</p>
    <p>Seated with a friend at the front of the bus, I raise my mo­bile phone to take a we­fie, pan­ning the cam­era to get a shot of the other bus pas­sen­gers.</p>
    <p>I am on a bus tour with a group of about 20 mi­grant work­ers. My friend is an ac­tive vol­un­teer with the Covid-19 Mi­grant Sup­port Coali­tion. For the past week, a team of them has been tak­ing groups of work­ers on bus tours to see the lights. This is pos­si­ble only af­ter the rules were re­laxed to al­low mi­grant work­ers to take part in some recre­ational ac­tiv­i­ties out­side their lodg­ings.</p>
    <p>On the bus, I chat with a worker seated be­hind me. He has been in Sin­ga­pore for 13 years, with the same em­ployer. He shows me a video on his mo­bile phone, of his curly-haired, danc­ing grand­daugh­ter, who is three. He has never been to the Ma­rina Bay area, or Or­chard Road.</p>
    <p>As the bus winds down Ma­rina, then Chi­na­town and Or­chard Road, the work­ers take pic­tures, video-call their fam­i­lies or look around. At one point, one of them breaks into a haunt­ing chant that the oth­ers fol­low.</p>
    <p>When the bus turns down Seran­goon Road, cheers erupt as the work­ers recog­nise Lit­tle In­dia. They wave – and for the first time since the bus took off – some peo­ple from the street wave back.</p>
    <p>Be­fore the bus set off, I had joined the group of vol­un­teers at the dor­mi­tory, dis­tribut­ing packs of briyani rice and eat­ing with the work­ers. The can­teen re­minded me of a school can­teen, with its long ta­bles and benches. There are shelves on each side of the room, each with mul­ti­ple power points – pre­sum­ably for work­ers to cook or boil water in pre-Covid-19 days.</p>
    <p>I won­der if the dorm has fridges for the work­ers – be­cause I had heard that hav­ing no fridges means work­ers can’t buy fresh food to store ahead, but must buy fresh food on the day it­self from the res­i­dent min­i­marts, which ap­par­ently tend to mark up prices. So the ab­sence of a sim­ple ap­pli­ance adds to liv­ing costs for a group of work­ers al­ready mak­ing their every dol­lar stretch.</p>
    <p>Fridges also use up a lot of power, which means dorm op­er­a­tors are not likely to favour in­stalling them. And as some­one re­marked to me, how do you sort out whose car­rot it is in a fridge, in a dorm of a few thou­sand work­ers? Far bet­ter to avoid such con­flict over gro­cery own­er­ship, and do away with fridges al­to­gether.</p>
    <p>Sit­ting on the bus with the work­ers, I feel like a tourist twice over. I am a tourist look­ing at the Or­chard Road lights. I am also a tourist in the land of the mi­grant work­ers, view­ing their lives from across a vast chasm.</p>
    <p>My friend tells me that when vol­un­teers ask the work­ers what they want to see in the new dorms be­ing built, they have mod­est re­quests. It would be nice, muses one, to have a mir­ror so he can shave him­self and not have to ask a mate to hold up his mo­bile phone cam­era for him to see him­self.</p>
    <p>I be­gin to un­der­stand why some of the ac­tivists ad­vo­cat­ing bet­ter con­di­tions for mi­grant work­ers are so pas­sion­ate about their cause, and why some seem so an­gry. Lis­ten­ing to my vol­un­teer friend’s sto­ries is enough to make me tear up. I am sure that un­der­stand­ing more of the work­ers’ liv­ing con­di­tions will stir the emo­tions even more – and I do not want them stirred.</p>
    <p>Even com­ing for this bus tour was a mini-chal­lenge for me. I had to talk my­self into it. I pride my­self on hav­ing em­pa­thy for the down­trod­den, but male mi­grant work­ers from South Asia have had lit­tle place in my sym­pa­thy, not since the night I was ac­costed by one near my home, who tried to fol­low me. Ter­ri­fied, I ran the last 100m stretch back to my condo.</p>
    <p>The sheer in­dig­nity of hav­ing to be­have like a vic­tim of ha­rass­ment in my ma­ture mid­dle age bit deep. Ever since then, I be­long to the Nimby (not in my back­yard) camp – you go ahead and wel­come mi­grant worker dorms in your neigh­bour­hood, I hope they stay out of mine.</p>
    <p>But of course one sin­gle episode should not lead me to tar an en­tire pop­u­la­tion.</p>
    <p>The bus tour was my brief en­counter with Sin­ga­pore’s un­der­belly. The in­ci­dent nig­gled at my con­science.</p>
    <p>The ex­plo­sion of the coro­n­avirus in­fec­tions among mi­grant work­ers has fo­cused na­tional at­ten­tion on their liv­ing con­di­tions. Forced into pro­longed lock­down in their dorms for our sake to ring-fence the in­fec­tions, they have to deal with the men­tal toll of iso­la­tion to keep us safe. Our lock­down lasted weeks. Theirs is last­ing months. We owe it to them to set things right.</p>
    <p>If Covid-19 taught us one thing, it is that we are all in­ter­con­nected, and that what we fail to do for our most vul­ner­a­ble comes back to bite us. If we do not im­prove the liv­ing con­di­tions of our mi­grant work­ers, the next pan­demic may rage un­con­trolled in the larger com­mu­nity. A range of other is­sues be­devil mi­grant work­ers – such as un­paid salaries, and be­ing forced to work de­spite in­juries. Most of us know the is­sues; we choose to look the other way.</p>
    <p>But Covid-19 has taught us that there is no them and us. There’s just us, all in­ter­con­nected.</p>
    <p>“There’s just us” also means if you and I do not care, if the vol­un­teers do not step up, no one does. And the in­jus­tice con­tin­ues.</p>
    <p>THE LES­SON ABOUT FACE MASKS</p>
    <p>In Jan­uary, I was in Ja­pan on a hol­i­day when news of a strange virus in Wuhan, China, started top­ping news cov­er­age. A Sin­ga­porean friend ad­vised us to buy face masks in Ja­pan. We bought a few boxes and de­cided we would buy more later in the trip, rather than lug them around to sev­eral cities in the travel itin­er­ary.</p>
    <p>As the trip went on, more news emerged of the virus and its spread. Masks be­came in short sup­ply, too, in Ja­pan. By the end of our trip, we could no longer find them in the shops.</p>
    <p>Back in Sin­ga­pore, through Fe­bru­ary and March, the is­sue of face masks cropped up. It later emerged that one rea­son for Sin­ga­pore’s ad­vi­sory against the wear­ing of masks was fear of their short sup­ply. Sur­gi­cal masks were pri­ori­tised for health­care staff world­wide. Fac­to­ries in China were clos­ing as the econ­omy shut down to con­trol the virus spread. A world­wide short­age of masks was feared.</p>
    <p>The ad­vice in­stead was to wear face masks only when un­well. But as more ev­i­dence emerged of asymp­to­matic spread, the gov­ern­ment ad­vi­sory changed to wear­ing of masks. By mid-April, wear­ing masks out­side the home be­came manda­tory.</p>
    <p>Once masks were needed, Sin­ga­pore­ans ral­lied and rose to the oc­ca­sion. Thou­sands of peo­ple dusted off their sewing ma­chines and formed sewing brigades, shar­ing mask pat­terns, cloths, thread and sup­plies. They took to so­cial me­dia to seek help. Fund-rais­ing ef­forts kicked in. Teams of sewing war­riors made face masks for the marginalis­ed and low-in­come and ar­ranged de­liv­ery. As China got the virus un­der con­trol, fac­to­ries opened, the flow of sur­gi­cal masks en­tered back into the mar­ket­place, and the feared short­age of masks did not hap­pen.</p>
    <p>Watch­ing the events un­fold, I felt that the ini­tial ad­vi­sory on not wear­ing masks was made in part out of fear. It was an ex­am­ple of a de­ci­sion made on the ba­sis of ac­cept­ing lim­its, not ex­pand­ing pos­si­bil­i­ties.</p>
    <p>A world­view based on lim­its sees short­ages. Such a view sees only what is present, to­day, from one’s lim­ited van­tage point. So a gov­ern­ment agency fear­ful of not procur­ing enough masks for the na­tion may then de­cide to dis­cour­age wear­ing them (pro­vided such ad­vice does not go against the med­i­cal ev­i­dence, of course, and in this case the World Health Or­gan­i­sa­tion in the early days of Covid-19 was also say­ing that masks weren’t nec­es­sary if you weren’t ill).</p>
    <p>A world­view based on pos­si­bil­ity looks at what is out there, beyond the lim­its of one­self, and con­sid­ers what can be done, from mul­ti­ple van­tage points.</p>
    <p>A gov­ern­ment with such a view con­sid­ers not just what it can do alone with its or­gans of state, but also what it can do with ci­ti­zens, the pri­vate sec­tor and civil so­ci­ety groups. Such a gov­ern­ment can har­ness the po­ten­tial of so­ci­ety, and is con­fi­dent that ci­ti­zens will step up and be re­source­ful and re­silient, to meet needs.</p>
    <p>In the lim­ited world, there is only me, and what I am ca­pa­ble of. In the ex­panded world, there is us – you and me, to­gether – and what we can achieve to­gether is lim­it­less.</p>
    <p>The les­son of face masks is one of the piv­otal lessons from Covid-19, and it is one I hope we will re­mem­ber.</p>
    <p>2020 has been a year of su­perla­tives, with much suf­fer­ing and hard­ship, but also of­fer­ing tremen­dous op­por­tu­nity for change. Not for noth­ing has Covid-19 been called the great disruption, and then the great re­set.</p>
    <p>As 2021 dawns, we should re­mem­ber what Covid-19 taught us: There is no us and them – no mi­grant ver­sus lo­cal; no gov­ern­ment ver­sus peo­ple.</p>
    <p>There’s just us and we’re all in it to­gether. We are in­di­vid­u­als, but bound by a web of con­nec­tion and re­spon­si­bil­ity to one another.</p>
    <p>The sooner we re­alise this and act it out, the faster we will heal from any bro­ken sys­tems, and the health­ier a so­ci­ety we can be­come.</p>
    <p>A world­view based on pos­si­bil­ity looks at what is out there, beyond the lim­its of one­self, and con­sid­ers what can be done, from mul­ti­ple van­tage points.</p>
    <p>A gov­ern­ment with such a view con­sid­ers not just what it can do alone with its or­gans of state, but also what it can do with ci­ti­zens, the pri­vate sec­tor and civil so­ci­ety groups.</p>
    <p>Such a gov­ern­ment can har­ness the po­ten­tial of so­ci­ety, and is con­fi­dent that ci­ti­zens will step up and be re­source­ful and re­silient, to meet needs.</p>
