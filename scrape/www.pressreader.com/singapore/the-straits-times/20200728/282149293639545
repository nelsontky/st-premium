    <p>The joint ven­ture be­tween Malaysia and Sin­ga­pore – M+S – has ob­tained a $1.95 bil­lion green loan for its Ma­rina One de­vel­op­ment.</p>
    <p>This is the largest green loan for a real es­tate firm in the Asia-Pa­cific, said the de­vel­oper, which is 60 per cent owned by Malaysian sov­er­eign wealth fund Khaz­anah Na­sional and 40 per cent by Sin­ga­pore in­vest­ment firm Te­masek Hold­ings.</p>
    <p>The loan from DBS Bank, OCBC and United Over­seas Bank will par­tially finance Ma­rina One’s of­fice and re­tail com­po­nents, which are val­ued at about $5 bil­lion. The res­i­den­tial part is not part of the loan pack­age.</p>
    <p>The Ma­rina One East and West Tow­ers have nearly 1.9 mil­lion square feet of Grade A of­fice space, in­clud­ing two floors can­tilevered across both tow­ers. They house cor­po­ra­tions such as Face­book, PwC, Mit­subishi UFJ Fi­nan­cial Group, Julius Baer, Net­flix, Ra­jah and Tann and Pru­den­tial. The re­tail podium spans around 140,000 sq ft across four floors.</p>
    <p>M+S said yes­ter­day that about 80 per cent of the 1,042 apart­ments have been sold at the two res­i­den­tial tow­ers, named Ma­rina One Res­i­dences.</p>
    <p>Sus­tain­abil­ity is at the heart of Ma­rina One’s ar­chi­tec­ture and op­er­a­tion, M+S said.</p>
    <p>Ev­ery facet of the ar­chi­tec­ture serves to cre­ate en­vi­ron­men­tal ben­e­fits. For in­stance, the building ori­en­ta­tion and the me­an­der­ing lou­vres on its fa­cade pro­vide each level with di­rect shade from the sun to re­duce heat and cool­ing needs.</p>
    <p>In­no­va­tive tech­nolo­gies are also used to con­serve en­ergy and boost ef­fi­ciency, such as the re­cy­cling of heat and power, rain­wa­ter har­vest­ing, en­ergy-sav­ing building man­age­ment sys­tems and high-per­for­mance so­lar glaz­ing.</p>
    <p>The de­vel­op­ment was named the global win­ner of the sus­tain­able de­vel­op­ment cat­e­gory at the 2020 FIABCI World Prix d’Ex­cel­lence Awards.</p>
    <p>M+S chief ex­ec­u­tive Kemmy Tan said Ma­rina One is “liv­ing proof that com­mer­cial real es­tate can, and should, em­brace the prin­ci­ples of sus­tain­abil­ity with­out com­pro­mis­ing on de­sign and qual­ity”.</p>
    <p>Ms Elaine Lam, OCBC’s head of global cor­po­rate bank­ing, said the land­mark deal will bol­ster Sin­ga­pore’s rep­u­ta­tion in sus­tain­able fi­nanc­ing.</p>
    <p>M+S was set up in 2011 to develop two projects in Sin­ga­pore, Ma­rina One and Duo, as part of a his­toric land-swap deal sealed be­tween the two coun­tries.</p>
