    <p>THE­ATRE</p>
    <p>TUES­DAYS WITH MORRIE</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore Reper­tory The­atre</p>
    <p>Last Wed­nes­day, Sin­ga­pore Reper­tory The­atre KC Arts Cen­tre</p>
    <p>First a con­fes­sion: This re­viewer is not a fan of the best-sell­ing 1997 mem­oir by jour­nal­ist Mitch Al­bom.</p>
    <p>It be­longed in the trend of best­selling sen­ti­men­tal pab­u­lum which was madly pop­u­lar to­wards the end of the 20th cen­tury as the land­mark date of 2000 loomed.</p>
    <p>Oh, what a dif­fer­ence 20 years makes. Tues­days With Morrie, as it turns out, is just the right sort of gently nos­tal­gic panacea for this manic year, es­pe­cially since the pre­view night co­in­cided with the bizarrely stress­ful cir­cus that is the Amer­i­can pres­i­den­tial elec­tion.</p>
    <p>Vet­eran ac­tor Remesh Pan­icker mod­u­lates his res­o­nant rum­ble and loosens his lanky frame to play the titular Pro­fes­sor Morrie Schwartz, whose Yoda-like apho­risms help Al­bom to a new un­der­stand­ing of life, love and liv­ing.</p>
    <p>Ben­jamin Chow plumbs a deep well of yup­piedom for Al­bom’s goget­ting jour­nal­ist with a fear of in­ti­macy dis­guised as a typ­i­cal mas­cu­line dis­taste for the “touchy feely”.</p>
    <p>There are some short­com­ings in the script in­her­ent in the source ma­te­rial. While Al­bom claims that Morrie was his favourite pro­fes­sor, he promptly breaks his prom­ise to keep in touch. He re­unites with his teacher 16 years af­ter grad­u­a­tion, af­ter the lat­ter is di­ag­nosed with amy­otrophic lat­eral scle­ro­sis, bet­ter known as Lou Gehrig’s dis­ease.</p>
    <p>The stage adap­ta­tion by Al­bom and Jef­frey Hatcher sticks fairly faith­fully to the source ma­te­rial, with chunks of ex­po­si­tion and di­a­logue lifted ver­ba­tim from the book. It is the slow build­ing of the ten­der rap­port be­tween Pan­icker and Chow, both nat­u­rally charis­matic per­form­ers, which rescues this from the abyss of Hall­mark slush.</p>
    <p>Pan­icker, other than an early in­tro­duc­tory scene in which he flails about in an amus­ingly un­in­hib­ited dance rou­tine, is mostly con­fined to a re­cliner for the en­tire per­for­mance, re­ly­ing in­stead on his face and his ex­pres­sive voice to con­vey Morrie’s quirky charms. He suc­ceeds in con­vey­ing the per­sis­tent teacher, who in­sists on ask­ing more of his stu­dents right to the last, and his mea­sured de­liv­ery even im­bues some of Morrie’s max­ims with sweet sin­cer­ity.</p>
    <p>Chow de­liv­ers the phys­i­cal counterpoi­nt to Pan­icker’s still cen­tre, his rest­less move­ment around the homey set filled with book­shelves con­vey­ing Al­bom’s un­ease with his seem­ingly suc­cess­ful life.</p>
    <p>By the time the tear­ful de­noue­ment rolls around, these two ac­tors have in­vested suf­fi­cient ef­fort to earn the sen­ti­ment. And Morrie’s dic­tum to Al­bom to for­give ev­ery­one, in­clud­ing him­self, is a mes­sage worth re­peat­ing in these di­vided times.</p>
