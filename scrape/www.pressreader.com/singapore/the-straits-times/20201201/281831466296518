    <p>•</p>
    <p>Iran has vowed it will not “fall into the trap” of scup­per­ing any fu­ture talks with the in­com­ing Bi­den gov­ern­ment i n the United States, fol­low­ing the as­sas­si­na­tion of a top nu­clear sci­en­tist.</p>
    <p>“Iran’s sci­en­tific and de­fence poli­cies won’t change be­cause of the as­sas­si­na­tion of one sci­en­tist or gen­eral,” said gov­ern­ment spokesman Ali Ra­biei on Sun­day.</p>
    <p>The Is­lamic Repub­lic “shouldn’t fall into the trap of link­ing the as­sas­si­na­tion to past nu­clear ne­go­ti­a­tions”, he said i n a state­ment posted on the gov­ern­ment’s of­fi­cial web­site.</p>
    <p>Dr Mohsen Fakhrizade­h, a vet­eran physi­cist who played a ma­jor role in Iran’s nu­clear re­search and de­fence ac­tiv­i­ties, was killed in a bomb­ing and shoot­ing am­bush out­side Teheran last Fri­day.</p>
    <p>Un­der­scor­ing the sup­port for diplo­macy, For­eign Min­is­ter Mo­ham­mad Javad Zarif said that while “Iran and the US will con­tinue to have fun­da­men­tal dif­fer­ences”, the ten­sion be­tween Teheran and Wash­ing­ton need not con­tinue af­ter Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump is out of of­fice.</p>
    <p>“Un­der Trump’s pres­i­dency, Iran and US ten­sions rose to a 40-year peak. It seems un­nec­es­sary for this sit­u­a­tion to con­tinue,” Mr Zarif told the En­tekhab news web­site in an in­ter­view on Sun­day.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, Dr Fakhrizade­h was buried in a ceme­tery in north­ern Teheran yes­ter­day, state TV re­ported, as the De­fence Min­is­ter, Brigadier-Gen­eral Amir Hatami, promised the Is­lamic Repub­lic would re­tal­i­ate over his killing.</p>
    <p>Dr Fakhrizade­h’s body was taken to the Imamzadeh Saleh ceme­tery af­ter a cer­e­mony at the De­fence Min­istry.</p>
    <p>Iran’s English-lan­guage Press TV re­ported yes­ter­day that the weapon used in the killing of Dr Fakhrizade­h was made in Is­rael, Teheran’s long-time enemy.</p>
    <p>“The weapons col­lected from the site of the ter­ror­ist act (where Dr Fakhrizade­h was as­sas­si­nated) bear the logo and spec­i­fi­ca­tions of the Is­raeli mil­i­tary in­dus­try,” an un­named source told Press TV.</p>
    <p>The semi-of­fi­cial Fars news agency on Sun­day said the nu­clear sci­en­tist was killed by a ma­chine gun op­er­ated by re­mote con­trol, while the Ara­bic-lan­guage Al Alam TV re­ported that the weapons used in the killing were “con­trolled by satel­lite”. Wit­nesses last Fri­day told state TV that there were gun­men on the ground.</p>
    <p>Is­raeli In­tel­li­gence Min­is­ter Eli Co­hen, speak­ing be­fore the Press TV re­port, told ra­dio sta­tion 103 FM yes­ter­day that he did not know who was re­spon­si­ble for Dr Fakhrizade­h’s killing.</p>
    <p>On Sun­day, the ul­tra-hard­line Kay­han news­pa­per, whose ed­i­tor is ap­pointed by Supreme Leader Ay­a­tol­lah Ali Khamenei, pub­lished an opin­ion piece call­ing for the north­ern Is­raeli city of Haifa to be at­tacked in re­tal­i­a­tion. “As­sum­ing that the role of the Zion­ist regime in this great mar­tyr­dom can be proved, we can op­er­a­tionalise this threat,” the col­umn said.</p>
    <p>In Britain, For­eign Min­is­ter Do­minic Raab on Sun­day said the coun­try is “con­cerned” about the pos­si­ble es­ca­la­tion of ten­sions in the Mid­dle East fol­low­ing the as­sas­si­na­tion of Dr Fakhrizade­h.</p>
    <p>“We are con­cerned about the sit­u­a­tion in Iran and the wider re­gion, we do want to see de-es­ca­la­tion of ten­sions,” he told Sky News.</p>
    <p>Separately, Qatari For­eign Min­is­ter Mo­hammed bin Ab­dul­rah­man Al-Thani con­demned the killing of Dr Fakhrizade­h in a phone call last Satur­day with his Ira­nian coun­ter­part, Mr Zarif, a min­istry state­ment said.</p>
    <p>The United Arab Emi­rates (UAE) has also con­demned the as­sas­si­na­tion, de­scrib­ing the at­tack as a “crime” that could in­crease ten­sions across the re­gion.</p>
    <p>The UAE de­nun­ci­a­tion late on Sun­day was sig­nif­i­cant both be­cause of the his­tor­i­cally strained re­la­tions be­tween Sunni Gulf Arab states and Shi’ite Iran, and the fact that Is­rael re­cently signed a nor­mal­i­sa­tion deal with the UAE.</p>
