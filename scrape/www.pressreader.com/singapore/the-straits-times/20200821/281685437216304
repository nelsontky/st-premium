    <p>Plans to bring more job fairs to the heart­land are in the works, even as the Covid-19 pan­demic takes a toll on the labour mar­ket.</p>
    <p>The Na­tional Trades Union Congress’ Em­ploy­ment and Em­ploy­a­bil­ity In­sti­tute (e2i) has been work­ing with com­mu­nity part­ners, in­clud­ing agen­cies and em­ploy­ers, to bring job and train­ing op­por­tu­ni­ties to Sin­ga­pore­ans nearer their homes, e2i chief ex­ec­u­tive Gilbert Tan told The Straits Times.</p>
    <p>This month alone, there are more than 20 such events across Sin­ga­pore, in lo­ca­tions such as Ad­mi­ralty, Bis­han and Ta­man Jurong.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, a job fair was held by the in­sti­tute at Chong Pang Com­mu­nity Club which saw some 160 Sin­ga­pore­ans turn­ing up to seek em­ploy­ment help. There were more than 1,600 va­can­cies avail­able, in­clud­ing for house­keep­ers, busi­ness an­a­lysts, in­ven­tory con­trollers, se­cu­rity of­fi­cers and man­u­fac­tur­ing spe­cial­ists.</p>
    <p>While some com­pa­nies are lay­ing off staff or have stopped hir­ing due to the im­pact of the pan­demic, there are oth­ers that need staff.</p>
    <p>Cer­tain sec­tors such as early child­hood ed­u­ca­tion, built en­vi­ron­ment, trans­port and lo­gis­tics are show­ing a stronger hir­ing de­mand, said Mr Tan, adding that a good mix of full­time, part-time and tem­po­rary job roles is avail­able at these job fairs.</p>
    <p>“We work with part­ners from dif­fer­ent sec­tors seek­ing to hire Sin­ga­pore­ans to cu­rate job va­can­cies and bring par­tic­i­pat­ing em­ploy­ers and job seek­ers to­gether.”</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day’s job fair – the first of five or­gan­ised by the e2i in Nee Soon GRC – of­fered job seek­ers ca­reer ad­vice and on-the-spot in­ter­views with po­ten­tial em­ploy­ers, which come from sec­tors such as se­cu­rity, re­tail, health­care and man­u­fac­tur­ing. The re­main­ing four job fairs will be held in other parts of Nee Soon over the next few months.</p>
    <p>Home Af­fairs and Law Min­is­ter K. Shan­mugam, who at­tended yes­ter­day’s event, said the fo­cus has al­ways been on en­sur­ing that Sin­ga­pore­ans have jobs. “With­out jobs, you can’t look after your­self. You can’t look after your fam­ily,” added Mr Shan­mugam, who is also an MP for Nee Soon GRC.</p>
    <p>Many job seek­ers who at­tended the event went from one booth to an­other to speak with par­tic­i­pat­ing em­ploy­ers, which in­cluded Ae­tos Hold­ings, Cold Stor­age Sin­ga­pore, In­do­guna and All Saints Home.</p>
    <p>Gourmet food provider In­do­guna said it has been look­ing to fill the po­si­tions of work­ers who have left, as well as the new roles cre­ated.</p>
    <p>“While we are try­ing to meet our re­source re­quire­ments, our pri­or­ity is the Sin­ga­pore core,” it added.</p>
    <p>Se­cu­rity firm Ae­tos Hold­ings said it has been ac­tively re­cruit­ing and help­ing af­fected Sin­ga­pore­ans by of­fer­ing them part-time and full-time po­si­tions as aux­il­iary po­lice of­fi­cers or se­cu­rity of­fi­cers since the pan­demic started.</p>
    <p>One job seeker, Mr Lim Kim Hung, a man­ager at a disco at Golden Mile Com­plex, has not worked for the past five months. Night­clubs and dis­cos have been shut since late March to help stem the spread of Covid-19.</p>
    <p>“There is no cer­tainty as to when op­er­at­ing re­stric­tions would be lifted,” the 56-year-old, who ap­plied for a clean­ing job, said in Man­darin. “In­stead of stay­ing at home, I felt that I should come here and find an­other job.”</p>
    <p>An­other job ap­pli­cant, Mr John Ong, said he has sent out more than 30 job ap­pli­ca­tions and had a few in­ter­views since he was re­trenched from a travel firm a month ago.</p>
    <p>The 30-year-old for­mer au­di­tor, who turned up at the job fair in of­fice at­tire, has ap­plied for a busi­ness an­a­lyst role at Cold Stor­age.</p>
    <p>“It has been tough find­ing a job. Many com­pa­nies have a hir­ing freeze,” he said. “So I have de­cided to be proac­tive and see if there are job op­por­tu­ni­ties out there.”</p>
