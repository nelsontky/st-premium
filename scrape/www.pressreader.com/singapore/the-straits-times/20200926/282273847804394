    <p>Four di­rec­tors of Novena Global Health­care Group, which is founded by cousins Nel­son and Ter­ence Loh, have set up a com­mit­tee to in­ves­ti­gate its au­dited ac­counts.</p>
    <p>This comes af­ter ac­count­ing firm Ernst & Young (EY) alerted the po­lice that its sig­na­tures were al­legedly forged on the fi­nan­cial state­ments of the group, a hold­ing com­pany in­cor­po­rated in the Cay­man Is­lands.</p>
    <p>The di­rec­tors said yes­ter­day: “The board is aware that EY has since filed a po­lice re­port over forged au­dited ac­counts.</p>
    <p>“The board in­tends to take its own steps to in­ves­ti­gate and ap­point so­lic­i­tors.”</p>
    <p>The state­ment also said that “the board has ap­pointed a com­mit­tee to re­struc­ture and scru­ti­nise the af­fairs of Novena Global Health­care Group and its sub­sidiaries”.</p>
    <p>It noted that nei­ther the firm nor its sub­sidiaries can en­ter any trans­ac­tions with­out the com­mit­tee’s au­tho­ri­sa­tion.</p>
    <p>The di­rec­tors were not named. TSMP Law Cor­po­ra­tion, which acts for one of the di­rec­tors, said the com­mit­tee does not in­clude any share­hold­ers or co-founders Nel­son and Ter­ence Loh. Both were in­vited to the vir­tual meet­ing dur­ing which the com­mit­tee was formed. But they did not at­tend, said the law firm.</p>
    <p>The Straits Times re­ported on Thurs­day that po­lice had be­gun in­ves­ti­ga­tions into Novena Global Health­care Group for al­legedly us­ing unau­tho­rised sig­na­tures of EY on its fi­nan­cial state­ments.</p>
    <p>Mr Ter­ence Loh, 42 and Mr Nel­son Loh, 40, were in the spot­light last month af­ter their re­ported £280 mil­lion (S$490 mil­lion) takeover bid for English Premier League club New­cas­tle United.</p>
    <p>To­gether with their Chi­nese busi­ness part­ner Evan­ge­line Shen, 32, they co-founded Bel­la­graph Nova Group, which placed the bid for the foot­ball club.</p>
    <p>Ax­ing­ton, a Catal­ist-listed com­pany owned by the Lohs, also came un­der the spot­light. Ms Shen re­signed from the board as did other di­rec­tors while trad­ing of the counter was sus­pended on Aug 31.</p>
    <p>The four di­rec­tors said yes­ter­day that “Novena Global Health­care Group is wholly un­con­nected and un­re­lated to the Bel­la­graph Nova Group or Ax­ing­ton, and any of the al­le­ga­tions made in re­la­tion to the con­duct of Nel­son and Ter­ence Loh in the man­age­ment of Bel­la­graph Nova or Ax­ing­ton”.</p>
    <p>How­ever, they did not re­ply when asked to clar­ify the links be­tween Novena Global Health­care Group, Bel­la­graph Nova Group and Ax­ing­ton, given that var­i­ous pub­lic­ity ma­te­ri­als had named the en­ti­ties in con­junc­tion with one an­other.</p>
