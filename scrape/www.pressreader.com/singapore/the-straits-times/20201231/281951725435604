    <p>TOKYO • Tokyo’s Covid-19 outbreak is se­vere and could ex­plode in the com­ing days just as Ja­pan be­gins its New Year hol­i­day pe­riod, in which mil­lions of peo­ple usu­ally move around the coun­try, the city’s gov­er­nor has said.</p>
    <p>The cap­i­tal recorded 944 new coro­n­avirus cases yes­ter­day, just un­der the record 949 recorded on Satur­day, and med­i­cal ex­perts warned that un­less the outbreak is checked, the city could soon see over 1,000 new pa­tients a day.</p>
    <p>With the lat­est fig­ure, the cap­i­tal has seen a to­tal of 58,840 con­firmed cases.</p>
    <p>“Please em­pha­sise life over fun,” Gov­er­nor Yuriko Koike told a news con­fer­ence yes­ter­day, call­ing on peo­ple to stay at home as much as pos­si­ble over the hol­i­day.</p>
    <p>Tokyo was at a crit­i­cal junc­ture, with cold win­ter weather fore­cast and highly con­ta­gious vari­ant strains of the coro­n­avirus from Bri­tain and South Africa al­ready de­tected in Ja­pan, Ms Koike said.</p>
    <p>“The situation is ex­tremely se­vere. We are fac­ing up to a huge wave of virus cases we have not seen be­fore,” she added.</p>
    <p>“The num­ber of cases could ex­plode at any time. Any one of us could be­come in­fected at any time... If we do not stamp this out now, we will be fac­ing a much worse situation.”</p>
    <p>The Ja­panese govern­ment on Mon­day started ban­ning the en­try of non-res­i­dent for­eign na­tion­als, fol­low­ing the dis­cov­ery of the Bri­tish vari­ant in Ja­pan, and has been call­ing on cit­i­zens to re­frain from the par­ties, fam­ily gath­er­ings and travel that are usual at this time of year.</p>
    <p>The pol­icy, which will be in place un­til the end of next month, could af­fect ath­letes and staff plan­ning to at­tend com­pe­ti­tions and train­ing camps in prepa­ra­tion for the post­poned Tokyo Olympics and Par­a­lympics next sum­mer, Ky­odo News re­ported yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>About 3,400 peo­ple had died in Ja­pan from the coro­n­avirus in to­tal as at late Tues­day, out of some 227,390 cases, NHK public tele­vi­sion said.</p>
    <p>In South Korea, new Covid-19 cases stayed above 1,000 for a sec­ond straight day yes­ter­day and vari­ant cases rose to five, Yon­hap news agency re­ported.</p>
    <p>The coun­try has a to­tal of 59,773 cases, with 879 deaths, ac­cord­ing to the Korea Dis­ease Control and Pre­ven­tion Agency.</p>
    <p>The agency con­firmed two coro­n­avirus vari­ant cases, bring­ing the Bri­tain-orig­i­nated virus cases to five.</p>
    <p>The authoritie­s could fur­ther tighten so­cial dis­tanc­ing rules this week­end as year-end trav­els increased the risk of more cases, Prime Min­is­ter Chung Sye-kyun told a govern­ment meet­ing.</p>
    <p>A prison in south-eastern Seoul had 771 in­mates and 21 staff in­fected, bring­ing the to­tal num­ber of in­fec­tions linked to the fa­cil­ity to 792, the Jus­tice Min­istry said.</p>
    <p>Jus­tice Min­is­ter Choo Mi-ae vis­ited the prison on Tues­day. Mean­while, me­dia dis­played pic­tures of the in­mates hold­ing up signs read­ing “Please save us”.</p>
    <p>GET PRI­OR­I­TIES RIGHT Please em­pha­sise life over fun.</p>
    <p>TOKYO GOV­ER­NOR YURIKO KOIKE, call­ing on peo­ple to stay at home as much as pos­si­ble over the New Year hol­i­day pe­riod.</p>
