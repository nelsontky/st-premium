    <p>With the Covid-19 pan­demic forc­ing the can­cel­la­tion of top races such as the Bos­ton and Ber­lin Marathons, the Repub­lic’s mar­quee mass run­ning event, the Stan­dard Char­tered Sin­ga­pore Marathon (SCSM), will be de­part­ing from its tra­di­tional road race for­mat for a vir­tual one.</p>
    <p>Two ini­tia­tives, the SCSM Vir­tual Club and SCSM Vir­tual Rac­ing Se­ries, were launched yes­ter­day to com­ple­ment the De­cem­ber race.</p>
    <p>This year’s SCSM will fea­ture a “unique al­ter­na­tive race for­mat with vir­tual and pos­si­ble phys­i­cal com­po­nents”, said its or­gan­iser Iron­man Group in a press state­ment.</p>
    <p>Phys­i­cal el­e­ments of the race “are be­ing ex­plored de­pend­ing on reg­u­la­tions to re­place the tra­di­tional road race”, said the or­gan­is­ers, and more de­tails will be an­nounced soon via the SCSM’s dig­i­tal plat­forms.</p>
    <p>Ge­off Meyer, the Iron­man Group’s man­ag­ing di­rec­tor for Asia, said dur­ing a vir­tual press con­fer­ence yes­ter­day: “We would love to be launch­ing a 50,000-per­son event run­ning through the streets of Sin­ga­pore, but ob­vi­ously this is not to be the case in our cur­rent en­vi­ron­ment.</p>
    <p>“The SCSM Vir­tual Club is a 15-week run­ning en­gage­ment, which is like a candy store for all our run­ners... (it) will bring to­gether the run­ning com­mu­nity in new ways, while in­tro­duc­ing ex­tra mo­ti­va­tion into the train­ing rou­tine and bring­ing run­ners to the grand fin­ish, all in a safe and con­trol­lable en­vi­ron­ment.”</p>
    <p>The club, which is free to join, in­cludes weekly races and chal­lenges, an on­line store with re­deemable re­wards, train­ing and nu­tri­tional re­sources and per­for­mance track­ing.</p>
    <p>Run­ners can also track their run­ning data and com­pare their per­for­mances to their peers across lo­cal and global leader boards.</p>
    <p>They can also take part in the weekly Vir­tual Rac­ing Se­ries, con­ducted over 15 races and grouped ac­cord­ing to four themes that cel­e­brate run­ning routes that are unique to Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>An ac­tiv­ity-based loy­alty point sys­tem has also been de­signed to mo­ti­vate run­ners by earn­ing points as they train, and they are re­warded through mer­chan­dise, dis­counts and spe­cial ben­e­fits.</p>
    <p>On race week­end, the SCSM’s vir­tual re­al­ity com­po­nent will al­low run­ners to cre­ate avatars that can nav­i­gate through the vir­tual race route in real time and com­pete with fel­low run­ners. Or­gan­is­ers have also said that par­tic­i­pants can still look for­ward to the event’s “sig­na­ture fin­isher ex­pe­ri­ence” – com­plete with their fin­isher photo.</p>
    <p>Call­ing this year’s event a “unique ex­pe­ri­ence”, Min­is­ter for Cul­ture, Com­mu­nity and Youth Ed­win Tong said: “With the launch of new in­no­va­tive so­lu­tions, we will be able to con­tinue train­ing and connecting with fel­low run­ners and ath­letes from around the world.”</p>
    <p>Mem­bers of the run­ning com­mu­nity wel­comed the launch of the Vir­tual Club, with mar­ket­ing di­rec­tor Nick Kao sign­ing up shortly af­ter its launch.</p>
    <p>The 37-year-old, who runs five days a week, said: “Dur­ing the pan­demic a lot of run­ners have been par­tic­i­pat­ing in a lot of vir­tual runs, and we were quite sur­prised that the SCSM is able to do some­thing that’s dif­fer­ent from the other vir­tual runs.</p>
    <p>“The main dif­fer­ence is of course the sys­tem – the plat­form is a lit­tle bit like (fit­ness track­ing app) Strava which we are used to, but I’m very ex­cited about this be­cause this is more lo­cal where a lot of run­ners will be able to know more about the dif­fer­ent run­ning groups in Sin­ga­pore and places we haven’t ex­plored be­fore.”</p>
