    <p>The National Wages Coun­cil (NWC) will con­vene later this month, for the sec­ond time this year, to tackle the grow­ing threat to jobs posed by the coron­avirus pan­demic, it was an­nounced yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The coun­cil – com­pris­ing rep­re­sen­ta­tives from the Gov­ern­ment, em­ploy­ers and unions – will up­date guide­lines is­sued in March on wage and em­ploy­ment-re­lated is­sues for busi­nesses, with the aim of hav­ing the new ones out by next month.</p>
    <p>Ear­lier this month, ob­servers called for more ag­gres­sive wage sup­port, an of­fice to look after gig work­ers and pay hikes for low-wage staff.</p>
    <p>They said the coun­cil could con­sider mea­sures such as higher sup­port for job re­design and re­train­ing and ad­di­tional guide­lines on re­trench­ment pay­ments, as well as look­ing at whether the Jobs Sup­port Scheme of wage sub­si­dies could be ex­tended.</p>
    <p>The March guide­lines, which cover the pe­riod from April 1 this year to June 30 next year, rec­om­mended that em­ploy­ers should first re­duce non-wage costs and con­sider mea­sures to man­age ex­cess man­power.</p>
    <p>It also asked em­ploy­ers to tap gov­ern­ment sup­port to off­set busi­ness and wage costs, and con­tinue with work­force trans­for­ma­tion to be in a bet­ter po­si­tion to grow when eco­nomic re­cov­ery comes.</p>
    <p>Em­ploy­ers that still find it nec­es­sary to trim wages to save jobs were urged to adopt a grad­u­ated ap­proach and give spe­cial con­sid­er­a­tion to low-wage work­ers.</p>
    <p>The guide­lines also stated that lay­offs should be the last re­sort and should be con­ducted re­spon­si­bly.</p>
    <p>“The labour mar­ket has soft­ened con­sid­er­ably since,” the Min­istry of Man­power (MOM) said yes­ter­day, cit­ing pre­lim­i­nary data that in­di­cated a huge de­cline in to­tal em­ploy­ment in the sec­ond quar­ter, more than four times the drop in the first quar­ter.</p>
    <p>“The soft­ness... is likely to per­sist amid the weak ex­ter­nal eco­nomic en­vi­ron­ment, and the pres­sure on com­pa­nies to re­trench will mount,” it added.</p>
    <p>To­tal em­ploy­ment, ex­clud­ing for</p>
    <p>Num­ber of work­ers laid off in the sec­ond quar­ter eign do­mes­tic work­ers, plunged by 121,800 in the sec­ond quar­ter.</p>
    <p>Re­trench­ments more than dou­bled in the sec­ond quar­ter, with 6,700 work­ers laid off, up from 3,220 in the first quar­ter.</p>
    <p>DBS chair­man Peter Seah, who also chairs the NWC, said yes­ter­day: “In the light of the pro­found im­pact of the Covid-19 pan­demic on the econ­omy, com­pa­nies and es­pe­cially work­ers, it is im­por­tant that the tri­par­tite part­ners re­view the chal­lenges posed and make rec­om­men­da­tions to re­spond to the is­sues.”</p>
    <p>Coun­cil mem­bers in­clude Sin­ga­pore National Em­ploy­ers Fed­er­a­tion pres­i­dent Robert Yap, Sin­ga­pore Busi­ness Fed­er­a­tion vicechair­man Gan Seow Kee, National Trades Union Congress pres­i­dent</p>
    <p>Mary Liew, NTUC as­sis­tant sec­re­tary-gen­eral Des­mond Choo, MOM Per­ma­nent Sec­re­tary Aubeck Kam and Min­istry of Trade and In­dus­try Per­ma­nent Sec­re­tary Gabriel Lim.</p>
    <p>This will be only the fourth time that the coun­cil has re-as­sessed guide­lines twice in the same year since be­ing set up in 1972.</p>
    <p>The other in­stances oc­curred in 2009 amid the global fi­nan­cial cri­sis, in 2001 after the Sept 11 at­tacks in the United States and dur­ing the 1998 Asian fi­nan­cial cri­sis.</p>
    <p>The pub­lic can give their views on wage and em­ploy­ment-re­lated is­sues and suggest changes to the guide­lines at go.gov.sg/nwcfeed­back un­til Aug 28.</p>

        <p data-role="text">Few visi&#xAD;tors were seen on an af&#xAD;ter&#xAD;noon at Re&#xAD;sorts World Sen&#xAD;tosa last month. Dr Kevin Cheong, chair&#xAD;man of the As&#xAD;so&#xAD;ci&#xAD;a&#xAD;tion of Sin&#xAD;ga&#xAD;pore At&#xAD;trac&#xAD;tions, said most tourist at&#xAD;trac&#xAD;tions that have been al&#xAD;lowed to re&#xAD;open are cur&#xAD;rently re&#xAD;stricted to no more than 25 per cent of their op&#xAD;er&#xAD;at&#xAD;ing ca&#xAD;pac&#xAD;ity at any one time, so they should get more sub&#xAD;si&#xAD;dies than those not fac&#xAD;ing such lim&#xAD;its.</p>
