    <p>The Covid-19 pan­demic has made the need for in­no­va­tion more im­me­di­ate and dras­tic, said a se­nior World Health Or­gan­i­sa­tion (WHO) of­fi­cial yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>But the com­plex­ity of this process “can­not be un­der­stated”, added WHO re­gional di­rec­tor for the Western Pa­cific re­gion Takeshi Ka­sai, as he urged coun­tries to work to­gether to over­come chal­lenges in a post-Covid-19 world.</p>
    <p>Dr Ka­sai, speak­ing at the open­ing of the WHO’s three-day vir­tual In­no­va­tion Fo­rum, said the un­prece­dented pan­demic has “up­ended the ways in which our so­ci­eties op­er­ate, and how we per­ceive and value the health of our­selves and oth­ers”.</p>
    <p>“It has forced us to repri­ori­tise is­sues, re­op­ti­mise sys­tems and come up with in­ge­nious ways of do­ing things and to take bet­ter care of the most vul­ner­a­ble,” Dr Ka­sai said.</p>
    <p>The pan­demic has forced many coun­tries to in­no­vate, he added. One of them is Viet­nam.</p>
    <p>A top health of­fi­cial of the coun­try cited how Covid-19 has­tened its use of telemedici­ne to im­prove the qual­ity and safety of its health­care.</p>
    <p>Said Dr Luong Ngoc Khue, gen­eral di­rec­tor of med­i­cal ser­vice ad­min­is­tra­tion in Viet­nam’s Health Min­istry: “We have set up work­ing groups con­sist­ing of the most ex­pe­ri­enced clin­i­cians through­out the coun­try to have real-time ex­change of med­i­cal ex­per­tise among the ex­perts to aid de­ci­sion-mak­ing i n treat­ing Covid-19 pa­tients.”</p>
    <p>Dr Khue said his gov­ern­ment has since pushed for fur­ther dig­i­tal­i­sa­tion “in all as­pects of life”, in­clud­ing the health­care sec­tor, to en­sure ad­e­quate and good-qual­ity health ser­vices can reach those in need.</p>
    <p>The fo­rum, whose theme is Achiev­ing The Health Fu­ture We Need, was mod­er­ated by Dr Gundo Weiler, WHO’s di­rec­tor of data, strat­egy and in­no­va­tion at the Western Pa­cific re­gional of­fice.</p>
    <p>He said the WHO will launch a re­gional in­no­va­tion plat­form for the Western Pa­cific in the com­ing months to help mem­ber states in their health­care in­no­va­tion ef­forts.</p>
    <p>“In­no­va­tion can no longer be a buzz­word or some­thing that is done by some­one else. It is up to all of us to step up and en­gage with emerg­ing tech­nolo­gies and de­vel­op­ments,” he added.</p>
    <p>The WHO’s Western Pa­cific re­gion in­cludes China, Ja­pan, South Korea, Aus­tralia, Sin­ga­pore, In­done­sia and Viet­nam, among oth­ers.</p>
    <p>Dr Ya­suyuki Sa­hara, the se­nior as­sis­tant min­is­ter for health se­cu­rity and tech­nol­ogy at Ja­pan’s Min­istry of Health, Labour and Wel­fare, spoke on his coun­try’s vi­sion of the next phase of hu­man so­ci­ety.</p>
    <p>The phase is dubbed “So­ci­ety 5.0”, or the fifth type of so­ci­ety after hunter-gath­erer, agri­cul­tural, in­dus­trial and in­for­ma­tion so­ci­eties.</p>
    <p>Tech­no­log­i­cal ad­vance­ment, which is swiftly ac­cel­er­at­ing, will play a key role in “So­ci­ety 5.0”, Dr Sa­hara said, and pol­i­cy­mak­ers will need a clear pic­ture of what it will look like to pre­pare for it.</p>
    <p>Dr San­dro Galea, dean of Bos­ton Univer­sity’s School of Pub­lic Health, noted that the world is grow­ing in­creas­ingly ur­ban.</p>
    <p>This opens up pos­si­bil­i­ties for health-fo­cused in­no­va­tion in var­i­ous ar­eas, in­clud­ing af­ford­able pub­lic trans­port, which brings health ben­e­fits such as re­duc­ing pol­lu­tion and in­creas­ing phys­i­cal ac­tiv­ity.</p>
    <p>An­other speaker, for­mer Sin­ga­pore Nom­i­nated MP Kuik ShiaoYin, stressed the im­por­tance of win­ning peo­ple’s trust and mak­ing per­sonal con­nec­tions when push­ing for in­no­va­tion and or­gan­i­sa­tional change.</p>
    <p>Oth­er­wise, there might be re­sis­tance, she said.</p>
