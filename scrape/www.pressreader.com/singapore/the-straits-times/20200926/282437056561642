    <p>LONDON Teenage Manch­ester City striker Liam De­lap has ad­mit­ted that be­ing named in the start­ing line-up for their League Cup third-round clash with Bournemout­h caught him off guard, but it will “take weeks” be­fore he stops smil­ing.</p>
    <p>His fa­ther, for­mer Stoke stal­wart Rory, was just as proud af­ter see­ing him mark his se­nior City de­but with a goal.</p>
    <p>Liam scored the opener for Pep Guardi­ola’s side in the 2-1 win at the Eti­had, run­ning on to Phil Fo­den’s through ball be­fore fir­ing past Cher­ries goal­keeper Mark Travers.</p>
    <p>Sam Sur­ridge equalised for the sec­ond-tier English side, but Fo­den popped up with the win­ner 15 min­utes from time as the Cup hold­ers booked a fourth-round clash at fel­low English Premier League side Burn­ley next week.</p>
    <p>With Guardi­ola later re­veal­ing that City have only 13 fit play­ers at the mo­ment, Liam is likely to have more chances to im­press, even though he is still pinch­ing him­self.</p>
    <p>“It was a bit of a shock to be put in, but I just worked my hard­est,” he told the BBC. “I was buzzing to get the call-up and, to top it with a goal, I can’t ask for much more.</p>
    <p>“I need to keep work­ing hard in train­ing and look to take every op­por­tu­nity I get.”</p>
    <p>On the young prospect, Guardi­ola said: “With the prob­lems we have up front (Ser­gio Aguero is out for at least two months), he will stay with us. We will use him.</p>
    <p>“At 17, Liam is a dif­fer­ent striker to what we have in terms of phys­i­cal­ity. We see in train­ing how good a fin­isher he is. Now is the time to be calm and keep work­ing. We are de­lighted with his per­for­mance.”</p>
    <p>For­mer mid­fielder Rory was far more known for his long throw-ins and bruis­ing style of play, so he is de­lighted to see his son’s pro­fes­sional ca­reer take off.</p>
    <p>De­lap Sr, 44, told The Sun: “I didn’t have his pace or power, and it took me a few more chances to put the ball in the back of the net.</p>
    <p>“He’s en­joy­ing it and that’s all I’m both­ered about... he’s a good lad and, if he keeps his head down and works hard, he’ll have a chance.”</p>
    <p>Liam is also not mod­el­ling his game af­ter his dad though, claim­ing that “I’ve al­ways looked up to Cris­tiano Ron­aldo”.</p>
    <p>Else­where, Premier League cham­pi­ons Liver­pool thrashed third-tier Lin­coln City 7-2 to set up a fourth-round meet­ing with Arse­nal next week, their sec­ond meet­ing at An­field in four days.</p>
