    <p>Elec­tri­cal fit­tings, es­pe­cially in bath­rooms, should be prop­erly in­stalled and main­tained, ex­perts and res­i­dents told The Sun­day Times, fol­low­ing an in­ci­dent where an el­derly cou­ple and their son died of sus­pected elec­tro­cu­tion in the cou­ple’s flat in Lake­side last week.</p>
    <p>The 80-year-old man re­port­edly fell in the shower on Thurs­day at Block 120 Ho Ching Road. He and his wife, 66, were be­lieved to have been elec­tro­cuted when she rushed in to as­sist him.</p>
    <p>Their son, 45, tried to re­vive them. It is un­der­stood that he was elec­tro­cuted too.</p>
    <p>“Typ­i­cal elec­tro­cu­tions in bath­rooms re­late to light fit­tings, wa­ter heaters, tanks, in­stan­ta­neous heaters or wall-mounted switches,” said char­tered build­ing sur­veyor Crispin Casimir. “Ex­posed ca­bling can be prob­lem­atic, as can be sim­ply op­er­at­ing such in­stal­la­tions with wet hands.”</p>
    <p>He said that elec­tri­cal fit­tings in bath­rooms should be pro­fes­sion­ally and se­curely in­stalled, earthed and main­tained. There should be no ex­posed or de­te­ri­o­rated ca­bling or elec­tri­cal parts.</p>
    <p>Wa­ter that comes into con­tact with ex­posed wiring – such as when an elec­tri­cal ap­pli­ance like a wa­ter heater is pulled from the wall – can be­come “live”, Mr Casimir said. Some­one who touches the wa­ter then can be elec­tro­cuted.</p>
    <p>Mr Ricky Chan, chair­man of the me­chan­i­cal and elec­tri­cal engi­neer­ing tech­ni­cal com­mit­tee at The In­sti­tu­tion of Engi­neers, Sin­ga­pore, said: “When prop­erly de­signed and main­tained, there are pro­tec­tions in place, such as the au­to­matic dis­con­nec­tion of elec­tric­ity sup­ply when there is an elec­tri­cal fault or cur­rent leak­age de­tected via the resid­ual cur­rent cir­cuit breaker.”</p>
    <p>Res­i­dents of the block where the cou­ple lived were shocked by the in­ci­dent, but said they were not too wor­ried as long as they main­tained their homes’ elec­tri­cal fit­tings.</p>
    <p>Ms Jen­nifer Ong, 30, who works in ad­min­is­tra­tive lo­gis­tics, said she had a new wa­ter heater in­stalled this year.</p>
    <p>“I’ve lived here for about 10 years and have no prob­lems so far. If we have any prob­lem, we will con­tact the town coun­cil,” she said.</p>
    <p>Madam Len Joon Thai, 68, a cleaner, also said she changed her wa­ter heater just a few months ago.</p>
    <p>“We ren­o­vate and change ap­pli­ances when­ever we need to. Safety is the most im­por­tant... We can­not save money on these sorts of things,” she said.</p>
    <p>An­other res­i­dent, who wanted to be known as Madam Rosni, 63, said the first thing she did when mov­ing into the flat nearly a decade ago was to change the wiring and pip­ing, as well as the wa­ter heater.</p>
    <p>Madam Rosni, who works in a se­cu­rity com­pany, said: “That was the most im­por­tant thing to me when I moved in be­cause it’s an old flat and I didn’t know what con­di­tion ev­ery­thing was in.”</p>
    <p>Mr Casimir said that cir­cuit break­ers should also be checked and not tam­pered with, such as by tap­ing them.</p>
    <p>But if some­one does get elec­tro­cuted, Mr Chan said, oth­ers should not touch the per­son but should try to switch off the power source, such as the dis­tri­bu­tion board.</p>
    <p>“If is it not pos­si­ble to switch off the sup­ply, and med­i­cal as­sis­tance is still on the way, try to use a dry cloth or non-con­duc­tive tools such as a wooden tool to move the per­son from the live con­duc­tor or equip­ment,” he said.</p>
    <p>Mr Casimir said grab bars and non-slip floor sur­faces, as well as good light­ing, should also be con­sid­ered for the el­derly, to re­duce the risk of falls.</p>
    <p>No foul play is sus­pected in Thurs­day’s in­ci­dent. Po­lice in­ves­ti­ga­tions are on­go­ing.</p>
    <p>Char­tered build­ing sur­veyor Crispin Casimir said that elec­tri­cal fit­tings in bath­rooms should be pro­fes­sion­ally and se­curely in­stalled, earthed and main­tained. There should be no ex­posed or de­te­ri­o­rated ca­bling or elec­tri­cal parts.</p>
