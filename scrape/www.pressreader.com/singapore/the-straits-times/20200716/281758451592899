    <p>WASH­ING­TON • Two US hair stylists who wore masks while in­fected with the coro­n­avirus did not pass it on to the nearly 140 clients they saw over the course of sev­eral days, a study said on Tues­day.</p>
    <p>The re­port, re­leased by the United States Cen­tres for Dis­ease Con­trol and Preven­tion (CDC), said the find­ings added weight to uni­ver­sal face cov­er­ing poli­cies as a means of slow­ing the spread of the virus.</p>
    <p>On May 12, a hair stylist (Stylist A) de­vel­oped res­pi­ra­tory symp­toms at a sa­lon in Spring­field, Mis­souri, and con­tin­ued work­ing with clients un­til May 20, when she re­ceived a pos­i­tive test for the coro­n­avirus.</p>
    <p>Stylist A ig­nored med­i­cal ad­vice to self-iso­late af­ter her test on May 18.</p>
    <p>A sec­ond hair stylist (Stylist B), who had been ex­posed to the first, de­vel­oped symp­toms on May 15 and also con­tin­ued work­ing un­til May 20, when Stylist A got her test re­sult. Stylist B tested pos­i­tive two days later.</p>
    <p>Health of­fi­cials per­formed con­tact trac­ing, iden­ti­fy­ing a to­tal of 139 clients seen by the two stylists.</p>
    <p>The rest of the sa­lon’s staff were also quar­an­tined for two weeks.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing their in­ter­ac­tions with clients, both stylists had worn masks: Stylist A had worn a dou­ble­lay­ered cot­ton face cov­er­ing, while Stylist B had worn ei­ther a dou­ble­lay­ered cot­ton face cov­er­ing or a sur­gi­cal mask.</p>
    <p>But even when Stylist A had symp­toms, the two stylists in­ter­acted with each other while nei­ther was masked, in in­ter­vals be­tween clients.</p>
    <p>All 139 clients were mon­i­tored for symp­toms for the next two weeks, and test­ing was of­fered to all of them.</p>
    <p>None of the 67 tested was found to be pos­i­tive, and none of those who re­fused test­ing re­ported symp­toms over the next 14 days when they were sent daily text mes­sages in­quir­ing about their health.</p>
    <p>The over­whelm­ing ma­jor­ity wore ei­ther cloth masks or sur­gi­cal masks for the en­tire du­ra­tion of their ap­point­ments, which ranged be­tween 15 min­utes and 45 min­utes.</p>
    <p>Sci­en­tists be­lieve that while large droplets emit­ted by cough­ing or sneez­ing are pri­mar­ily re­spon­si­ble for spread­ing Covid-19, smaller droplets re­leased dur­ing or­di­nary speech are also po­ten­tially dan­ger­ous.</p>
    <p>This is par­tic­u­larly im­por­tant be­cause peo­ple might spread the virus un­know­ingly be­fore they de­velop symp­toms, or in rare cases, when they do not de­velop symp­toms at all.</p>
    <p>The au­thors of the CDC re­port con­cluded with a call for “wide­spread adop­tion of poli­cies re­quir­ing face cov­er­ings in pub­lic set­tings” to re­duce the scale and im­pact of Covid-19.</p>
    <p>In an on­line in­ter­view with the Jour­nal of the Amer­i­can Med­i­cal As­so­ci­a­tion, CDC di­rec­tor Robert Red­field said that if all Amer­i­cans wore a mask, the ris­ing cases of Covid-19 could be un­der con­trol within four to eight weeks.</p>
    <p>But he also said he was “sad” that the is­sue had be­come so politi­cised.</p>
    <p>“I am glad to see the Pres­i­dent and Vice-Pres­i­dent wear a mask. Clearly, in their sit­u­a­tion, they could eas­ily jus­tify they don’t need to... but we need for them to set the ex­am­ple.”</p>
