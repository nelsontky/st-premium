    <p>MI­AMI • It was an easy win for the Bos­ton Celtics over de­fend­ing cham­pi­ons the Toronto Rap­tors on Fri­day night but their bat­tle this Na­tional Basketball As­so­ci­a­tion (NBA) sea­son may not be over yet.</p>
    <p>As it stands, there is a likely chance that the two teams will clash again in the Eastern Con­fer­ence semi-fi­nals, and Celtics coach Brad Stevens has warned that this 122-100 rout would not have any sig­nif­i­cance when the day comes.</p>
    <p>“This game will mean noth­ing if we get that op­por­tu­nity again,” he said at the ESPN Wide World of Sports Com­plex near Or­lando, where the league is play­ing in a bub­ble due to the Covid-19 pan­demic.</p>
    <p>“They’re a re­ally good team. I thought they missed a lot of open looks and it just wasn’t their night. Our guys played well, but it won’t mean any­thing in a cou­ple weeks.”</p>
    <p>Bos­ton also won the sea­son series against Toronto, tak­ing three of the four meet­ings. Fol­low­ing Fri­day’s vic­tory, they have now won back-to-back games for the first time in the bub­ble.</p>
    <p>Jaylen Brown and Jayson Ta­tum pow­ered the Celtics (46-23) with 20 and 18 points re­spec­tively, keep­ing the Rap­tors (49-19) from clinch­ing the Eastern Con­fer­ence sec­ond seed­ing. Bos­ton are three games ahead of fourth-placed Mi­ami (43-26).</p>
    <p>“We’re get­ting there,” Ta­tum said.</p>
    <p>“I don’t want to put a cap on it, say where our ceil­ing is, but we’re im­prov­ing every day and we don’t want to stop.”</p>
    <p>The Celtics, who boasted seven dou­ble-fig­ure scor­ers, never trailed against the NBA’s sec­ond-best de­fen­sive squad, jump­ing ahead 52-37 at half-time and outscor­ing the Rap­tors 39-20 in the third quar­ter.</p>
    <p>“I don’t think it’s a sur­prise when your of­fence is di­alled in like that,” Stevens said.</p>
    <p>Bos­ton shot 49 per cent from the field and made 16 of 46 (34.8 per cent) from three-point range.</p>
    <p>They were eight of 12 from be­hind the arc in the third quar­ter when they outscored Toronto.</p>
    <p>The Rap­tors, who com­mit­ted 18 turnovers, shot just 42.7 per cent from the field and were just 10 of 38 (26.3 per cent) from long range.</p>
    <p>Fred VanVleet led Toronto with only 13 points. Ron­dae Hol­lis-Jef­fer­son, Kyle Lowry, Norman Pow­ell and Pas­cal Si­akam added 11 points apiece and Ter­ence Davis had 10.</p>
    <p>The Rap­tors – who had won seven con­sec­u­tive games, in­clud­ing their first three con­tests since the re­sump­tion of play – know it could be much dif­fer­ent should they face the Celtics again in the play-offs.</p>
    <p>“One thing about this team, we al­ways bounce back and we al­ways stick to­gether,” Pow­ell said. “I’m not too wor­ried.”</p>
    <p>In other games, the Brook­lyn Nets and Or­lando Magic clinched the last two berths in the Eastern play-offs in dif­fer­ent fash­ions.</p>
    <p>Brook­lyn, led by 22 points from Caris LeVert and 21 from Joe Har­ris, routed Sacra­mento 119-106.</p>
    <p>The Nets (33-36) en­sured ninth­place Washington could not pull within four games to force a play-in series un­der NBA restart rules.</p>
    <p>Or­lando (32-38) had a chance to win and seal a berth but the Philadel­phia 76ers ral­lied in the sec­ond half to beat them 108-101.</p>
    <p>In­stead, they reached the playoffs when Washington lost to New Or­leans 118-107, leav­ing the Wizards (24-45) the only win­less bub­ble team and too far back to threaten the Magic.</p>
    <p>In the West, Dil­lon Brooks scored 22 points to lead the Mem­phis Griz­zlies to a 121-92 win over the Ok­la­homa City Thun­der.</p>
    <p>The Griz­zlies win snapped a fiveg­ame los­ing streak that dated back to be­fore the sea­son was put on hold by the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>It also kept Mem­phis (33-37) in the eighth spot in the Western Con­fer­ence, a game ahead of Port­land with three re­main­ing.</p>
