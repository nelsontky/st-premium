    <p>NEW YORK • The Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion’s in­creased scrutiny of col­lege en­dow­ments and pen­sion funds back­ing Chi­nese com­pa­nies is cre­at­ing more road­blocks for ven­ture funds look­ing for the next big tech win­ner.</p>
    <p>Just six US-dol­lar funds with ex­po­sure to China have sought to raise cap­i­tal this year, down from 21 last year, ac­cord­ing to re­searcher Pre­qin. Of those, only one has man­aged to com­plete a pre­lim­i­nary clos­ing, com­pared with 10 last year.</p>
    <p>It is a dras­tic rev­er­sal of the ven­ture boom that fu­elled China’s tech in­dus­try in the past decade. The US State De­part­ment has asked col­leges and uni­ver­si­ties to di­vest from Chi­nese hold­ings in their en­dow­ments, warn­ing of po­ten­tially more oner­ous mea­sures on hold­ing the shares.</p>
    <p>That is on top of a wider cam­paign to curb Chi­nese tech cham­pi­ons and slow the money flow­ing into what are some of the world’s largest tech com­pa­nies, in­clud­ing Alibaba Group and TikTok owner Bytedance.</p>
    <p>“A to­tal decoupling of US fund­ing and Chi­nese tech­nol­ogy would also hurt Amer­i­can in­vestors,” said Mr J.P. Gan, found­ing part­ner of Ince Cap­i­tal, which last year raised US$352 mil­lion (S$482 mil­lion) for its first fund with the back­ing of Univer­sity of Pitts­burgh, Duke Univer­sity and Carnegie Mel­lon Univer­sity.</p>
    <p>“US pen­sion funds and en­dow­ments have been the big­gest ben­e­fi­cia­ries from in­vest­ing in the China growth story,” he said.</p>
    <p>While some ven­ture funds, in­clud­ing DCM and Jen­er­a­tion Cap­i­tal, were able to close fi­nanc­ing rounds this year, those ef­forts started last year.</p>
    <p>Pre­qin tal­lies the ini­ti­a­tion of a fund based on pub­lic fil­ings such as with the US Se­cu­ri­ties and Ex­change Com­mis­sion.</p>
    <p>The coro­n­avirus has hit funds glob­ally. In the United States, while fund launches did not see as dras­tic a fall in rel­a­tive terms, new funds with US ex­po­sure seek­ing money fell by 6 per cent to 646. The num­ber of funds that man­aged to com­plete an in­terim clos­ing fell 76 per cent to 14, com­pared with last year.</p>
    <p>In­vestors rais­ing US-dol­lar funds to tar­get China’s fast-grow­ing tech in­dus­try usu­ally seek back­ing from Amer­i­can pen­sions or en­dow­ments. That back­ing has helped cre­ate some of the big­gest pri­vate tech firms like ar­ti­fi­cial-in­tel­li­gence gi­ant SenseTime Group – cur­rently fund-rais­ing at a US$8.5 bil­lion val­u­a­tion – and Mr Jack Ma’s Ant Group, which could be worth US$210 bil­lion based on Bern­stein es­ti­mates.</p>
    <p>Some of the world’s big­gest pri­vate eq­uity funds, in­clud­ing Sil­ver Lake Man­age­ment, Car­lyle Group and War­burg Pin­cus, have pinned their growth on in­vest­ing in Chi­nese com­pa­nies.</p>
    <p>All three put at least US$500 mil­lion in Ant and stand to gen­er­ate up to 40 per cent re­turns when the firm goes pub­lic.</p>
    <p>Chi­nese com­pa­nies can still look to list­ing in Hong Kong to al­low in­vestors to re­alise their gains. In re­cent years, in­vestors shaken by volatile mar­kets have in­creas­ingly shifted to park­ing their money with the big­gest funds with a proven track record.</p>
    <p>The US State De­part­ment’s let­ter warned en­dow­ments it would be pru­dent to di­vest from Chi­nese stocks in the “likely out­come” of a whole­sale delist­ing of Chi­nese com­pa­nies from US ex­changes by the end of next year. In May, the US Se­nate passed a Bill that threat­ens to re­move all Chi­nese com­pa­nies from US stock ex­changes un­less a US ac­count­ing reg­u­la­tor is al­lowed to in­spect their au­di­tors.</p>
    <p>The global mar­ket value of Chi­nese firms fac­ing delist­ing from the US to­talled US$1.9 tril­lion at the end of last year, said Mr Will Cai, a part­ner and head of cap­i­tal mar­kets at law firm Coo­ley Asia.</p>
