    <p>In re­cent months, I’ve high­lighted how de­fen­sive sec­tors would be re­silient and even ben­e­fit from the un­prece­dented cri­sis brought on by the coro­n­avirus pan­demic. One of th­ese is sup­ply chain se­cu­rity, and in par­tic­u­lar, food sup­ply se­cu­rity.</p>
    <p>The sight of long queues to buy food, empty su­per­mar­ket shelves and re­ports of short­ages around the world have driven home this point force­fully, so it is not sur­pris­ing that com­pa­nies po­si­tioned to keep sup­ply chains un­bro­ken are be­ing shown some love.</p>
    <p>In fact, what started as a fleet­ing in­fat­u­a­tion has now grad­u­ated to be­come a fully fledged love af­fair as the se­cond and third waves of Covid-19 emerge, forc­ing many gov­ern­ments to or­der lock­downs and stay-at-home or­ders.</p>
    <p>Sev­eral of the Sin­ga­pore Ex­change-listed food names I’ve cited pre­vi­ously have soared in value over the past two to three months. Now they have jus­ti­fied the mar­ket’s faith by show­ing strong re­sults.</p>
    <p>In­dus­trial meat, dairy and poul­try sup­plier Japfa an­nounced last week a whop­ping six­fold in­crease in its Jan­uary-to-June earn­ings to US$76.8 mil­lion (S$105.6 mil­lion), thanks largely to ris­ing prices of pork and dairy prod­ucts.</p>
    <p>While di­ver­si­fied Dairy Farm’s health and beauty prod­uct busi­nesses were a drag on earn­ings, its su­per­mar­kets like</p>
    <p>Cold Stor­age and China-based Yonghui per­formed strongly.</p>
    <p>But one Sin­ga­pore Ex­change-listed name stands out: home-grown su­per­mar­ket chain Sheng Siong.</p>
    <p>Last week the com­pany posted an as­tound­ing dou­bling of se­cond-quar­ter net earn­ings to $46.2 mil­lion, from $18.4 mil­lion a year ear­lier. This was on the back of a 76 per cent rise in rev­enue to $418.7 mil­lion in the three months to June 30, as con­sumers stocked up.</p>
    <p>This came af­ter a ster­ling first quar­ter when rev­enue rose 31 per cent to $328.7 mil­lion, while profit af­ter tax was up 48 per cent to</p>
    <p>$29 mil­lion, prompt­ing the com­pany to an­nounce a one-month bonus salary pay­ment to its staff.</p>
    <p>Taken to­gether with the Jan­uary-to-March re­sults, Sheng Siong’s full first-half earn­ings dou­bled to a record $75.2 mil­lion. Rev­enue in the six months to</p>
    <p>June 30 was up 53 per cent to $747.4 mil­lion.</p>
    <p>The com­pany, known for its gen­eros­ity to staff and share­hold­ers, dou­bled its in­terim div­i­dend pay­out to 3.5 cents a share.</p>
    <p>Faced with the un­cer­tain­ties of the pan­demic, in­clud­ing over food sup­ply, con­sumers have turned to Sheng Siong for rea­son­ably priced prod­ucts and no-fuss ser­vice.</p>
    <p>As the se­ri­ous­ness of the Covid-19 sit­u­a­tion be­came clear, Sheng Siong’s stock price started mov­ing in March. By mid-May, the shares were up 52 per cent as an­a­lysts started plac­ing the name on their “top picks” lists.</p>
    <p>And some have fur­ther up­graded the com­pany af­ter its first-half re­sults last week.</p>
    <p>DBS Group Re­search raised Sheng Siong’s price tar­get to $1.90, cit­ing it as a po­ten­tial takeover tar­get.</p>
    <p>“We be­lieve that Sheng Siong, with its strong store net­work and lo­gis­tics chain, could be a takeover tar­get for on­line play­ers even­tu­ally,” the DBS re­port said last Thurs­day.</p>
    <p>“On­line play­ers such as Alibaba’s Hema and Ama­zon (Whole­foods) are tak­ing the on­line-to-off­line route and op­er­at­ing phys­i­cal stores.”</p>
    <p>Whether or not that hap­pens, the fact re­mains that we are not out of the woods as far as Covid-19 is con­cerned. Se­cond and third waves have hit well-man­aged ge­ogra­phies like Hong Kong, South Korea and Ja­pan. Sin­ga­pore is not im­mune.</p>
    <p>Also, habits die hard. It is un­likely that cus­tomers will quickly turn away from this neigh­bour­hood su­per­mar­ket chain they have come to trust. At least not while the virus is still around.</p>
    <p>With the com­pany – with 61 out­lets in Sin­ga­pore and two in China – con­tin­u­ing its store roll-outs, its ro­bust growth will likely con­tinue.</p>
    <p>Sheng Siong’s re­tail model is def­i­nitely not unique. There are nu­mer­ous other play­ers, led by the likes of FairPrice and Dairy Farm’s Cold Stor­age out­lets.</p>
    <p>But this is a chain that has man­aged to find a niche among Hous­ing Board heart­landers and cost-con­scious con­sumers at a time when jobs and in­comes are at risk. In short, its com­pet­i­tive pric­ing strat­egy pro­vides it with an ad­van­tage.</p>
    <p>DBS Re­search also said: “Sheng Siong is a di­rect ben­e­fi­ciary of Sin­ga­pore su­per­mar­ket sales, in ad­di­tion to its de­fen­sive qual­i­ties of strong bal­ance sheet and cash­flow gen­er­a­tion ca­pa­bil­i­ties. Our es­ti­mates are above con­sen­sus as we be­lieve the mar­ket has yet to fac­tor in the full im­pact of the cir­cuit breaker on its earn­ings.”</p>
    <p>While one can­not ar­gue that Sheng Siong will face cost pres­sures such as rent and staff, this is an is­sue faced equally by its com­peti­tors. How­ever, it seems to have found a way of ad­dress­ing th­ese is­sues by find­ing con­ve­nient lower-cost lo­ca­tions, with most of its 553,020 sq ft of re­tail space lo­cated near the high-den­sity HDB heart­land.</p>
    <p>It has also been push­ing into e-com­merce with home de­liv­er­ies.</p>
    <p>No one knows when this Covid-19 cri­sis will pass. But when it does, many things will be dif­fer­ent. But one con­stant which peo­ple ev­ery­where need is the re­as­sur­ance of food sup­plies. Busi­nesses like FairPrice, Sheng Siong, Japfa and Dairy Farm pro­vide this re­as­sur­ance.</p>
