    <p>MA­RI­ETTA Hun­dreds of peo­ple lined up in the cold rain on Mon­day to cast bal­lots in a pair of United States Se­nate races in Ge­or­gia that will de­ter­mine con­trol of the cham­ber and in­flu­ence Demo­cratic Pres­i­dent-elect Joe Bi­den’s abil­ity to en­act his agenda.</p>
    <p>The south­ern state, dom­i­nated by Repub­li­cans for decades, is now one of the most com­pet­i­tive US po­lit­i­cal bat­tle­grounds af­ter Mr Bi­den’s nar­row vic­tory in the Nov 3 pres­i­den­tial elec­tion.</p>
    <p>Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump and other top Repub­li­cans have cam­paigned to try to help in­cum­bent Repub­li­can sen­a­tors David Per­due and Kelly Lo­ef­fler win in the Jan 5 polls, while Democrats have spent mil­lions to back chal­lengers Jon Os­soff and Raphael Warnock.</p>
    <p>Elec­tion ex­perts said turnout on the first day of early vot­ing could of­fer clues as to which side ul­ti­mately pre­vails. Civil rights mon­i­tors said they had re­ceived no re­ports of vot­ing prob­lems.</p>
    <p>The races will de­ter­mine con­trol of the Se­nate, and Democrats face an up­hill bat­tle as they would need to win both seats to con­trol the cham­ber and use that power to help ad­vance Mr Bi­den’s pri­or­i­ties.</p>
    <p>Repub­li­cans, mean­while, are warn­ing vot­ers that Mr Trump’s poli­cies are on the line.</p>
    <p>Mr Bi­den’s nar­row vic­tory has buoyed Demo­cratic hopes of an­other win, aided by ag­gres­sive Demo­cratic voter reg­is­tra­tion drives and de­mo­graphic trends that have nudged the elec­torate away from Repub­li­cans.</p>
    <p>Mr Per­due fin­ished just ahead of Mr Os­soff last month, while not quite get­ting the 50 per cent needed for a vic­tory un­der Ge­or­gia law. In the other race, nei­ther Mr Warnock nor Ms Lo­ef­fler reached the 50 per cent thresh­old in a field that in­cluded sev­eral other chal­lengers.</p>
    <p>Demo­cratic ac­tivist Stacey Abrams, who lost a race for Ge­or­gia gov­er­nor in 2018, told CNN that 1.2 mil­lion ab­sen­tee bal­lots have been re­quested thus far, with 85,000 of those com­ing from peo­ple who did not vote in the gen­eral elec­tion, and they are dis­pro­por­tion­ately young and peo­ple of colour.</p>
    <p>Democrats are de­pend­ing on vot­ers of colour, young peo­ple and col­lege-ed­u­cated whites to turn out for them in ur­ban and sub­ur­ban com­mu­ni­ties, while Repub­li­cans need Trump sup­port­ers in out­ly­ing ar­eas of the state.</p>
