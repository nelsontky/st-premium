    <p>RE­LENT­LESS</p>
    <p>Barcelona coach Ron­ald Koe­man praised his side’s re­lent­less press­ing af­ter their 2-1 win over Real So­ciedad on Wed­nes­day, when the Cata­lans fi­nally came alive af­ter an aw­ful start to the sea­son.</p>
    <p>The vis­i­tors be­gan the night as La Liga lead­ers and took the lead through Wi l l i a n Jose but Barcelona quickly over­came the early set­back thanks to strikes from Jordi Alba and Frenkie de Jong be­fore the break.</p>
    <p>“The first half was fan­tas­tic, we should have scored more goals. We were in­tense, we put them un­der a lot of pres­sure and we ran our­selves into the ground,” Koe­man said.</p>
    <p>“Real So­ciedad are ex­cel­lent on the ball but we kept rob­bing it off them, we pressed them so well. It was an open game be­cause our op­po­nents know how to play very well, but the game be­longed to us and it was a de­served tri­umph.”</p>
    <p>Lionel Messi had an off night, miss­ing sev­eral chances and also mis­plac­ing a cou­ple of key passes, but Koe­man said he was pleased with his cap­tain’s work rate.</p>
    <p>“This is the team I want to see. Ev­ery player played out of their skin,” he added.</p>
    <p>“The big­gest dif­fer­ence was our play with­out the ball to­day, and Messi worked very hard in that re­spect, press­ing a lot, and so did ev­ery­one else. That was the at­ti­tude we have to have when we don’t have the ball.”</p>
    <p>So­ciedad had been on a ninegame un­beaten run in the league and had hopes of tak­ing a point from the Nou Camp for the first time since 1995 but they failed to cope with the in­ten­sity.</p>
    <p>Prais­ing Koe­man’s men for their ef­forts, coach Imanol Al­guacil said: “We saw the best Barca we have seen for a very long time, es­pe­cially de­fen­sively.</p>
    <p>“That speaks highly of them and the re­spect they had for this game. We hadn’t seen a Barca this ag­gres­sive for so long.</p>
    <p>“Even Messi was div­ing to the floor to win tack­les.”</p>
    <p>The Cata­lans re­main six points off the top of the ta­ble be­hind Atletico Madrid (26), hav­ing played a game more.</p>
    <p>This is the team I want to see. Ev­ery player played out of their skin... That was the at­ti­tude we have to have when we don’t have the ball.</p>
