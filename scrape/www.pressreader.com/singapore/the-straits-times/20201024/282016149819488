    <p>For a road sign to be a road sign, it needs to be placed in prox­im­ity to traf­fic. Inevitably, it is only a mat­ter of time be­fore some­one drives into the pole. If the pole is sturdy, the re­sults may be fa­tal.</p>
    <p>The 99% In­vis­i­ble City, a de­light­ful new book about the un­der-ap­pre­ci­ated won­ders of good de­sign, ex­plains a so­lu­tion. The poles that sup­port street fur­ni­ture are of­ten mounted on a “slip base”, which joins an up­per pole to a mostly buried lower pole us­ing eas­ily break­able bolts.</p>
    <p>A car does not wrap it­self around a slip-based pole; in­stead, the base gives way quickly. Some slip bases are even set at an an­gle, launch­ing the up­per pole into the air over the ve­hi­cle. The sign is eas­ily re­paired, since the base it­self is un­dam­aged. Isn’t that clever?</p>
    <p>There are two el­e­ments to the clev­er­ness.</p>
    <p>One is spe­cific: the de­tailed de­sign of the slip-base sys­tem. But the other, far more gen­eral, is a way of think­ing which an­tic­i­pates that things some­times go wrong and then plans ac­cord­ingly.</p>
    <p>That way of think­ing was ev­i­dently miss­ing in Eng­land’s stut­ter­ing test-and-trace sys­tem for the coro­n­avirus, which, early this month, failed spec­tac­u­larly. Public Health Eng­land re­vealed that 15,841 pos­i­tive test re­sults had nei­ther been pub­lished nor passed on to con­tact trac­ers.</p>
    <p>The prox­i­mate cause of the prob­lem was re­ported to be the use of an out­dated file for­mat in an Ex­cel spread­sheet. Ex­cel is flex­i­ble and any id­iot can use it but it is not the right tool for this sort of job. It could fail in sev­eral dis­as­trous ways; in this case, the spread­sheet sim­ply ran out of rows to store the data. But the deeper cause seems to be that no­body with rel­e­vant ex­per­tise had been in­vited to con­sider the fail­ure modes of the sys­tem.</p>
    <p>What if it got hacked? What if some­one pastes the wrong for­mula into the spread­sheet? What if it runs out of num­bers?</p>
    <p>We should all spend more time think­ing about the prospect of fail­ure and what we might do about it. It is a use­ful men­tal habit but it is nei­ther easy nor en­joy­able.</p>
    <p>We hu­mans thrive on op­ti­mism. With­out the ca­pac­ity to ban­ish worst-case sce­nar­ios from our minds, we could hardly live life at all. Who could marry, try for a baby, set up a busi­ness or do any­thing else that mat­ters while ob­sess­ing about what might go wrong? It is more pleas­ant and more nat­u­ral to hope for the best.</p>
    <p>We must be care­ful, then, when we al­low our­selves to stare steadily at the prospect of fail­ure. Stare too long, or with eyes too wide, and we will be so paral­ysed with anx­i­ety that suc­cess, too, be­comes im­pos­si­ble.</p>
    <p>Care is also needed in the steps we take to pre­vent dis­as­ter. Some pre­cau­tions cause more trou­ble than they pre­vent. Any safety en­gi­neer can reel off a list of ac­ci­dents caused by mal­func­tion­ing safety sys­tems: too many back­ups add com­plex­ity and new ways to fail.</p>
    <p>My favourite ex­am­ple – de­scribed in the ex­cel­lent book by Chris Clearfield and An­dras Tilc­sik – was the fi­asco at the Academy Awards of 2017, when La La Land was an­nounced the win­ner of the Best Pic­ture Os­car that was in­tended for Moon­light. The mix-up was made pos­si­ble by the ex­is­tence of du­pli­cates of each award en­ve­lope – a pre­cau­tion that trig­gered the catas­tro­phe.</p>
    <p>But just be­cause it is hard to think pro­duc­tively about the risk of fail­ure does not mean we should give up. One gain is that of con­tin­gency plan­ning: If you an­tic­i­pate pos­si­ble prob­lems, you have the op­por­tu­nity to pre­vent them or to pre­pare the ideal re­sponse.</p>
    <p>A se­cond ad­van­tage is the pos­si­bil­ity of rapid learn­ing.</p>
    <p>When the aero­nau­ti­cal en­gi­neer Paul MacCready was work­ing on hu­man-pow­ered air­craft in the 1970s, his plane – the Gos­samer Con­dor – was de­signed to be eas­ily mod­i­fied and eas­ily re­paired af­ter the in­evitable crashes. (At one stage, the tail flap was ad­justed by tap­ing a Manila folder to it.)</p>
    <p>Where oth­ers had spent years fail­ing to win the pres­ti­gious Kre­mer prize for hu­man-pow­ered flight, MacCready’s team suc­ceeded in months. One se­cret to their suc­cess was that the feed­back loop of fly –> crash –> adapt was quick and cheap.</p>
    <p>Not ev­ery pro­ject is an aero­plane but there are plenty of analo­gies. When we launch a new pro­ject, we might think about pro­to­typ­ing, gath­er­ing data, de­sign­ing small ex­per­i­ments and avidly search­ing for feed­back from the peo­ple who might see what we do not.</p>
    <p>If we ex­pect that things will go wrong, we de­sign our projects to make learn­ing and adapt­ing part of the process. When we ig­nore the pos­si­bil­ity of fail­ure, when it comes it is likely to be ex­pen­sive and hard to learn from.</p>
    <p>The third ad­van­tage of think­ing se­ri­ously about fail­ure is that we may turn away from projects that are doomed from the out­set.</p>
    <p>From the in­va­sion of Iraq to the process of Brexit, se­ri­ously ex­plor­ing the daunt­ing prospect of dis­as­ter might have pro­voked the wise de­ci­sion not to start in the first place.</p>
    <p>But I have strayed a long way from the hum­ble slip base. It would be nice if all fail­ure could be an­tic­i­pated so per­fectly and el­e­gantly.</p>
    <p>Alas, the world is a messier place. All around us are fail­ures – of busi­ness mod­els, of pan­demic plan­ning, even of our demo­cratic in­sti­tu­tions. It is fan­ci­ful to imag­ine de­sign­ing slip bases for every­thing.</p>
    <p>Still: Most things fail, sooner or later. Some fail grace­fully, some dis­grace­fully. It is worth giv­ing that some thought.</p>
