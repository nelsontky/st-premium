    <p>Bri­tish ex­plorer Ash Dykes is the first per­son to walk the length of China’s Yangtze River. The jour­ney of 6,437km took 353 days to com­plete last year, and had him dodg­ing wolves and bat­tling the el­e­ments.</p>
    <p>The 29-year-old ex­treme ath­lete spoke to The Straits Times re­cently about his Guin­ness Record-set­ting feat, which is doc­u­mented in the se­ries Walk­ing The Yangtze With Ash Dykes, Part 2 of which airs to­mor­row at 9pm on Na­tional Ge­o­graphic (Sing­tel TV Chan­nel 201 and StarHub TV Chan­nel 411) and streams on Fox+.</p>
    <p>He shares what he learnt about China that he thinks out­siders mis­un­der­stand and what such treks can teach him and oth­ers when it comes to achiev­ing ev­ery­day goals.</p>
    <p>1 CHINA HAS A SPE­CIAL PLACE IN HIS HEART</p>
    <p>In a tele­phone chat from his home in north Wales, Dykes says China was the first for­eign coun­try he vis­ited, at age 19, and he had al­ways longed to see more of it.</p>
    <p>He de­cided to walk the Yangtze be­cause “the river cuts through im­mense diver­sity – it would take me through 11 prov­inces, show me both the wild and ur­ban sides of China, and lots of tra­di­tions, cul­tures, di­alects, wildlife and weather sys­tems along the way”.</p>
    <p>2 FAC­ING UP TO WOLVES, WEATHER AND POL­I­TICS</p>
    <p>It took the Welsh­man – who com­pleted record-set­ting treks across Mada­gas­car and Mon­go­lia – more than two years to work out the lo­gis­tics of his trip.</p>
    <p>One ma­jor rea­son no one had done it was po­lit­i­cal sen­si­tiv­ity. “The source of the Yangtze is close to Ti­bet and you need spe­cial per­mits that are dif­fi­cult even for lo­cals to get.”</p>
    <p>Then, one has to “con­tend with land­slides, bears, wolves and the al­ti­tude, which is about the same height as Mount Ever­est base camp, so just over 5,400m”, says Dykes.</p>
    <p>“In the win­ter, it can drop to mi­nus 40 deg C and you get bliz­zards. And it’s just so wild.”</p>
    <p>3 HE DID MOST OF IT ALONE AND IT TOOK A TOLL</p>
    <p>Dykes ended up mak­ing about 70 per cent of the jour­ney alone. Ten of the 16 peo­ple in his sup­port team had to be evac­u­ated be­cause of al­ti­tude sick­ness or fear of the wildlife and other dan­gers.</p>
    <p>It took a phys­i­cal toll on him. “I was okay with the al­ti­tude sick­ness, but there’s no avoid­ing the pains and blis­ters when you’re walk­ing such big dis­tances.</p>
    <p>“And there were aches from the ruck­sack, which weighed 30 to 35kg.”</p>
    <p>4 THE BEST PART WAS THE PEO­PLE</p>
    <p>As they heard about his jour­ney, lo­cals, Chi­nese celebri­ties and or­gan­i­sa­tions came out to greet him.</p>
    <p>“The in­ter­ac­tions with the lo­cals made the jour­ney, es­pe­cially in the first six months, when it was quite wild,” he re­calls.</p>
    <p>“They were al­ways invit­ing me in­side, feed­ing me, of­fer­ing me shel­ter and wish­ing me well. It’s stuff like that you can’t for­get.”</p>
    <p>He feels many for­eign­ers have mis­con­cep­tions about China be­cause of what they see in Western me­dia, which of­ten de­pict it as a “sup­pressed, dark place where no one re­ally has a say”.</p>
    <p>But the Chi­nese he met were “de­cent peo­ple and su­per hos­pitable”, be­sides hav­ing a vi­brant and strong sense of com­mu­nity, he says.</p>
    <p>5 PICK­ING UP LIFE LESSONS</p>
    <p>Walk­ing for up to 16 hours straight on his own, Dykes of­ten fell into a med­i­ta­tive state of mind.</p>
    <p>“The pains be­come numbed and it all be­comes quite tran­quil and you’re sort of in the zone.”</p>
    <p>This is also when he ends up do­ing some deep think­ing – “plan­ning, vi­su­al­is­ing and fo­cus­ing on the next goal”.</p>
    <p>And it ex­er­cises men­tal mus­cles, which then help him in ev­ery­day life, and which he shares with oth­ers dur­ing talks he gives.</p>
    <p>Whether it is walk­ing the Yangtze or work­ing to­wards any ma­jor goal, the key is to “break the goal down” into smaller mile­stones, he says.</p>
    <p>“On day one, when I had so many strug­gles even get­ting there and I still had 352 days left, it was im­por­tant not to look at the end goal and let that over­whelm me, but to fo­cus on break­ing it down into lots of lit­tle sec­tions to make it more achiev­able and make sure I’m man­ag­ing my ex­pec­ta­tions,” says Dykes. It also taught him per­se­ver­ance. “Some­times, I’ll get stressed work­ing on things back at home and not achieve as much as I’d hoped.</p>
    <p>“But although we can’t al­ways be mo­ti­vated, we can be dis­ci­plined. And it’s the dis­ci­pline I learn on my ex­pe­di­tions that helps me achieve my goals when I’m back home.”</p>
    <p>Walk­ing The Yangtze With Ash Dykes Part 2 airs to­mor­row at 9pm on Na­tional Ge­o­graphic (Sing­tel TV Chan­nel 201 and StarHub TV Chan­nel 411) and streams on Fox+.</p>
