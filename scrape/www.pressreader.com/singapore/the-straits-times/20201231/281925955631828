    <p>In­done­sian Pres­i­dent Joko Wi­dodo’s quest for a charis­matic and mod­er­ate re­li­gious af­fairs min­is­ter may have fi­nally come to a suc­cess­ful end with the ap­point­ment of Mus­lim cleric Yaqut Cho­lil Qoumas.</p>
    <p>On Christ­mas Eve, just a day after the 45-year-old was sworn into the Cabi­net in a ma­jor reshuf­fle, he made a rous­ing speech filled with warmth and hu­man­ity, wish­ing Chris­tians Merry Christ­mas and men­tion­ing Je­sus Christ by name.</p>
    <p>“This Christ­mas, we should un­der­stand the mean­ing of the birth of Je­sus Christ through re­flec­tion, through do­ing good, liv­ing sim­ply, show­ing con­cern for the weak and lov­ing one an­other,” he said.</p>
    <p>The same day, the min­is­ter also vowed to pro­tect the Shi’ite and Ah­madiyah minority sects which have for years faced per­se­cu­tion for their be­liefs deemed con­trary to main­stream Is­lam.</p>
    <p>“I don’t want mem­bers of Shi’ite and Ah­madiyah to be dis­placed from their homes be­cause of their be­liefs. They are cit­i­zens (whose rights) must be pro­tected,” he said as quoted by the Jakarta Post.</p>
    <p>An­a­lysts say Mr Yaqut’s mes­sages of in­clu­siv­ity and peace were timely, in the light of deadly at­tacks on Chris­tians last month – in­clud­ing a be­head­ing – by sus­pected ter­ror­ists as In­done­sia grap­ples with grow­ing Is­lamic mil­i­tancy.</p>
    <p>The new min­is­ter – a for­mer chief of An­sor, the youth wing of the coun­try’s largest Is­lamic mass or­gan­i­sa­tion, Nahd­latul Ulama (NU) – has in­di­cated a more equal treat­ment of re­li­gious com­mu­ni­ties and a bold re­jec­tion of ex­trem­ists with him in charge.</p>
    <p>Prom­i­nent Mus­lim in­tel­lec­tual Zuhairi Mis­rawi said Mr Yaqut has dis­played some traits of In­done­sia’s late pres­i­dent Ab­dur­rah­man Wahid, also known as Gus Dur, a re­formist Mus­lim scholar and a staunch de­fender of hu­man rights.</p>
    <p>“He’s aligned with Gus Dur’s phi­los­o­phy. When he de­lib­er­ates on poli­cies, he will en­sure ev­ery­one stands equal be­fore the law. There won’t be any ar­ro­gant groups try­ing to op­press the mi­nori­ties,” he told The Straits Times.</p>
    <p>Dr Zuhairi added: “It will be a breath of fresh air for the fu­ture of In­done­sia. We will stay plu­ral, tol­er­ant and peace­ful and show that broth­er­hood is a ne­ces­sity in the eyes of the state and the re­li­gion.”</p>
    <p>Mr Joko had ear­lier pinned his hopes on for­mer mil­i­tary gen­eral Fachrul Razi, but Mr Fachrul “did not know what he should do as a re­li­gious min­is­ter and he has no public sup­port”, Dr Syafiq Hasyim, a vis­it­ing fel­low at ISEAS – Yu­sof Ishak In­sti­tute, told ST.</p>
    <p>Un­like Mr Fachrul, Mr Yaqut has both the cre­den­tials – and the clout – to crush rad­i­cals who try to use re­li­gion to stir un­rest, an­a­lysts say.</p>
    <p>The min­is­ter is bet­ter known as Gus Yaqut, a com­mon hon­orific given to sons of cler­ics. His father was the late Muham­mad Cho­lil Bisri, co-founder of the Na­tional Awak­en­ing Party, or PKB, a na­tion­al­ist Mus­lim party with close links with NU. His brother is NU’s sec­re­tary-gen­eral Yahya Staquf.</p>
    <p>He is also no green­horn to pol­i­tics and bu­reau­cracy, hav­ing pre­vi­ously served as deputy re­gent for Rem­bang, in Cen­tral Java, and as an MP.</p>
    <p>He also has the might of the five-mil­lion-mem­ber An­sor be­hind him. An­sor’s for­mi­da­ble mili­tia arm, known as Banser, has left an in­deli­ble mark – a good one – through­out the na­tion’s his­tory. The para­mil­i­tary group, with its young and fit mem­bers, is well known for hu­man­i­tar­ian work in­clud­ing pro­tect­ing churches from ex­trem­ists.</p>
    <p>The min­is­ter will be watched over how he han­dles hard-line groups such as the Is­lamic De­fend­ers Front, which was of­fi­cially banned yes­ter­day for breach­ing public or­der and law, of­ten with vi­o­lence. Its leader, fire­brand cleric Rizieq Shi­hab, was de­tained ear­lier over mass gath­er­ings which broke Covid-19 pro­to­cols.</p>
    <p>But an­a­lysts be­lieve such groups would be bet­ter dealt with by the police. Dr Syafiq said: “We can’t be seen as sup­press­ing the rights of the fun­da­men­tal­ists too. We will be blamed as anti-demo­cratic.”</p>
    <p>An­a­lysts also noted that the re­turn of the re­li­gious port­fo­lio to NU, whose se­nior cler­ics have tra­di­tion­ally held the post, would help to mend ties and re­open com­mu­ni­ca­tion be­tween the Pres­i­dent and the or­gan­i­sa­tion.</p>
    <p>Dr Noor Huda Is­mail, a ter­ror­ism ex­pert and vis­it­ing fel­low at S. Ra­jarat­nam School of In­ter­na­tional Stud­ies, said ter­ror­ists have be­gun to wage their bat­tles “through the bal­lot in­stead of the bul­let”, push­ing their ex­trem­ist ide­ol­ogy through pol­i­tics.</p>
    <p>With more po­lit­i­cally savvy re­li­gious fig­ures like Mr Yaqut step­ping up to the plate and rais­ing their mod­er­ate voice through the govern­ment, it is hoped that the ter­ror­ists’ threat will be sub­dued, Dr Noor Huda said.</p>
    <p>He added: “Sadly, the threat of ter­ror­ism will not be rooted out com­pletely in In­done­sia. What we can do is to slow down the process of growth and con­tain its ten­ta­cles.”</p>
