    <p>NEW YORK • US stocks ended a tu­mul­tuous year with the Dow and S&P 500 at record highs, as the three ma­jor US eq­uity i ndexes notched solid-to-spec­tac­u­lar yearly gains de­spite an econ­omy up­ended by the Covid-19 virus as in­vestors looked to a post-pan­demic world.</p>
    <p>In a year that marked the end of the long­est bull mar­ket on record as pan­demic-in­duced govern­ment lock­downs bat­tered the global econ­omy, equities stormed back, with the S&P 500 climb­ing more than 66 per cent from its March 23 low, re­sult­ing in the short­est bear mar­ket in his­tory.</p>
    <p>The gains, which sent the Dow and S&P to record highs to close out the year and the Nas­daq to a record ear­lier this week, were fu­elled in part by mas­sive fis­cal and mone­tary stim­u­lus put in place to but­tress an econ­omy reel­ing from the coro­n­avirus fall­out, as well as progress on vac­cines.</p>
    <p>For the year, the S&P 500 gained 16.3 per cent, the Dow 7.2 per cent, and the Nas­daq 43.6 per cent, which marked the big­gest yearly gain for the tech-heavy in­dex since 2009.</p>
    <p>“For broad in­dexes, this is a bullish year de­spite the crazi­ness in the real world,” said Mr Mike Zig­mont, head of re­search and trad­ing at Har­vest Volatil­ity Man­age­ment.</p>
    <p>“It feels very much to me like in­vestors have de­cided the world has changed for­ever, the coro­n­avirus pan­demic was the cat­a­lyst and now in­vestors have de­cided who the win­ners are and who the losers are and are mov­ing for­ward.”</p>
    <p>Still, data on Thurs­day was a re­minder that the econ­omy still has a lengthy recovery ahead as weekly ini­tial job­less claims, while de­clin­ing for a se­cond straight week to 787,000, re­mained well above the peak of the 2007-2009 Great Re­ces­sion.</p>
    <p>Tech and con­sumer dis­cre­tionary were the best per­form­ing sec­tors on the year, while en­ergy, a lag­gard for the past decade, was once again the weak­est of the 11 ma­jor S&P sec­tors on the year en route to its worst yearly per­for­mance.</p>
    <p>Mega-cap com­pa­nies such as Ama­zon and Ap­ple helped lift the broad S&P 500 and Nas­daq, as well as gains in names that have ben­e­fited from the “stay-at-home” en­vi­ron­ment, such as on­line re­tailer Etsy and dig­i­tal pay­ment plat­form Pay­Pal.</p>
    <p>Shares of Tesla, added to the bench­mark S&P in­dex on Dec 21, rose an as­tound­ing 743 per cent on the year.</p>
    <p>For Thurs­day’s ses­sion, the Dow Jones In­dus­trial Av­er­age rose 196.92 points, or 0.65 per cent, to 30,606.48, the S&P 500 gained 24.03 points, or 0.64 per cent, to 3,756.07, and the Nas­daq Com­pos­ite added 18.28 points, or 0.14 per cent, to 12,888.28. All three ma­jor in­dexes gained ground, with the Dow and S&P 500 pick­ing up steam in the ses­sion’s fi­nal min­utes to se­cure record highs.</p>
    <p>Near-term ex­pec­ta­tions of big­ger stim­u­lus checks dimmed af­ter Se­nate Ma­jor­ity Leader Mitch McCon­nell blocked a quick vote on Wed­nes­day to back Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump’s call to in­crease Covid-19 re­lief cheques to US$2,000 from US$600.</p>
    <p>Risk as­sets were able to build on the rally off the March low, adding to gains in Novem­ber fol­low­ing a US elec­tion that in­vestors viewed as likely to re­sult in po­lit­i­cal grid­lock and op­ti­mism around vac­cines ap­provals grew, but the mo­men­tum stalled on wor­ries over fresh fis­cal stim­u­lus and a new, highly in­fec­tious Covid-19 vari­ant spread­ing glob­ally.</p>
    <p>All eyes are on two US Se­nate races in Ge­or­gia next week that will de­ter­mine con­trol of the cham­ber and in­flu­ence Demo­cratic Pres­i­dent-elect Joe Bi­den’s abil­ity to en­act his agenda.</p>
    <p>Vol­ume on US ex­changes was 9.27 bil­lion shares, com­pared with the 10.81 bil­lion av­er­age for the full ses­sion over the last 20 trad­ing days.</p>
    <p>Ad­vanc­ing is­sues out­num­bered de­clin­ing ones on the NYSE by a 1.44-to-1 ra­tio; on Nas­daq, a 1.13-to-1 ra­tio favoured de­clin­ers.</p>
    <p>The S&P 500 posted 29 new 52-week highs and no new lows; the Nas­daq recorded 131 new highs and 21 new lows.</p>
