    <p>The Swedish fur­ni­ture gi­ant’s new Lurvig range of pet fur­ni­ture is cre­ated by pet-lov­ing de­sign­ers and trained vet­eri­nar­i­ans who did re­search on the animals’ nat­u­ral needs and be­hav­iour.</p>
    <p>Dr Bar­bara Schafer, who does prod­uct risk as­sess­ment at Ikea and is also a trained vet­eri­nar­ian, says: “When it comes to sleep­ing, cats love clean and en­closed spa­ces and to lie on furry and cosy tex­tiles. Dogs, on the other hand, don’t care so much, as long as they have a space close to their own­ers.”</p>
    <p>The Lurvig col­lec­tion of­fers a wide range of cat and dog fur­ni­ture and ac­ces­sories in colours, pat­terns and tex­tures to suit pets’ dif­fer­ent per­son­al­i­ties and needs.</p>
    <p>The cat house (above), for in­stance, goes per­fectly with Ikea clas­sics such as the Kal­lax shelv­ing unit.</p>
    <p>Eat­ing be­hav­iour plays an im­por­tant part as well, says Dr Schafer. A tall ce­ramic bowl is ideal for cats as they tend to eat with their necks in a higher po­si­tion, while the flex­i­ble travel bowl suits dogs as they en­joy fre­quent snack­ing.</p>
    <p>Info: Prices range from 90 cents for a Lurvig bowl to $24.90 for a Lurvig blan­ket. More prod­ucts will be added to the ex­ist­ing range at Ikea stores pro­gres­sively till De­cem­ber.</p>
    <p>ARCHIFEST EVENTS TO CHECK OUT</p>
    <p>There is only a week left to the an­nual ar­chi­tec­ture fes­ti­val, so catch th­ese ac­tiv­i­ties be­fore the event ends on Oct 31.</p>
    <p>To­day, 1pm: Tune in to a free round­table dis­cus­sion on Prakarsa – a slew of ini­tia­tives by cre­atives to tackle hu­man­i­tar­ian and eco­log­i­cal is­sues world­wide. It is hosted by Ikatan Ar­sitek In­done­sia Sin­ga­pura (In­done­sian Ar­chi­tects As­so­ci­a­tion of Sin­ga­pore).</p>
    <p>The ar­chi­tect-ac­tivists will talk about why they stepped out of their com­fort zones to un­der­take th­ese tasks and how ar­chi­tec­ture as a dis­ci­pline en­ables them to do so.</p>
    <p>Info: To reg­is­ter, go to www.archifest.sg</p>
    <p>Next Tues­day, 10 and 10.30am: Food­scape Col­lec­tive, a com­mu­nity for sus­tain­able food sys­tems, is host­ing two free 30-minute ses­sions to share in­sights into how it has evolved while nur­tur­ing its gar­den space at Jurong Cen­tral Park.</p>
    <p>With the sup­port of the Na­tional Parks Board, the Bio­di­verse Edi­ble Gar­den in Jurong was started by Food­scape Col­lec­tive last year and has taken off with lo­cal res­i­dents join­ing the gar­den team.</p>
    <p>Learn how re­gen­er­a­tive food-grow­ing is prac­tised at the gar­den and how to im­prove soil health, in­crease bio­di­ver­sity, re­use waste food and gar­den trim­mings to create com­post and more.</p>
