    <p>The tally of global con­firmed coronaviru­s cases has reached 60 mil­lion, with Rus­sia and Iran hit­ting a record num­ber of deaths as the pace of new in­fec­tions ac­cel­er­ates across the United States, Europe and Latin Amer­ica.</p>
    <p>WASH­ING­TON • The global tally of con­firmed coronaviru­s cases hit 60 mil­lion on Wed­nes­day, with the num­ber of deaths reach­ing record highs in Rus­sia and Iran while the United States re­ported record num­bers of hos­pi­tal­i­sa­tions.</p>
    <p>Of­fi­cials in the US, the worst af­fected coun­try in the world, urged Amer­i­cans to stay home for the im­mi­nent Thanks­giv­ing hol­i­day as soar­ing num­bers of Covid-19 pa­tients pushed med­i­cal pro­fes­sion­als to the brink.</p>
    <p>The coun­try reg­is­tered more than 2,400 deaths from Covid-19 on Wed­nes­day, ac­cord­ing to the Johns Hop­kins Univer­sity tally – the high­est daily toll in six months. The to­tal death toll stands at 262,283.</p>
    <p>The US also re­ported one mil­lion new cases in less than a week, tak­ing its to­tal re­ported in­fec­tions to over 12.7 mil­lion.</p>
    <p>More than 12 per cent of beds in US hos­pi­tals were oc­cu­pied by Covid-19 pa­tients over the week­end, the most since April 9, ac­cord­ing to the US govern­ment’s lat­est data. The strain on hospi­tal ca­pac­ity has prompted New York state to re­open an emer­gency fa­cil­ity on Staten Is­land. And in neigh­bour­ing New Jer­sey, the num­ber of pa­tients in in­ten­sive care jumped 13 per cent in one day.</p>
    <p>The states of Texas and Cal­i­for­nia both broke their daily records of new in­fec­tions on Wed­nes­day.</p>
    <p>Glob­ally, in­fec­tions stand at about 60 mil­lion and deaths at 1.4 mil­lion. An anal­y­sis of the Reuters data showed the rate of new in­fec­tions pick­ing up glob­ally. It took just 17 days to go from 50 mil­lion cases to 60 mil­lion, com­pared with the 21 days it took to go from 40 mil­lion to 50 mil­lion. Around 580,000 cases have been re­ported each day over the past week and around half of all cases since the start of the pan­demic were re­ported over the past 70 days.</p>
    <p>Rus­sia and Iran reg­is­tered record num­bers of daily in­fec­tions and deaths.</p>
    <p>Iran’s Health Min­istry said there were 13,961 new cases yes­ter­day, a record for the third straight day, as to­tal cases stand at 908,346. The coun­try also re­ported 482 new deaths, bring­ing the to­tal num­ber of deaths to 46,689.</p>
    <p>Rus­sia yes­ter­day re­ported 25,487 new in­fec­tions, bring­ing the na­tional to­tal to 2.1 mil­lion cases since the begin­ning of the pan­demic – the fifth-high­est caseload in the world. The health au­thor­i­ties also re­ported 524 deaths, rais­ing Rus­sia’s to­tal fa­tal­i­ties from Covid-19 to around 38,000.</p>
    <p>It was the sec­ond time since last Satur­day that the coun­try had reg­is­tered record in­creases for both cases and deaths. De­spite the surge, Rus­sia has not im­posed the kind of lock­downs seen in some parts of Europe. But the govern­ment said yes­ter­day that it ex­pects to be­gin to vac­ci­nate the pop­u­la­tion this year.</p>
    <p>In Europe, one mil­lion new cases were recorded over just five days, for a to­tal of more than 16 mil­lion cases, in­clud­ing 365,000 deaths.</p>
    <p>Italy be­came the sec­ond Euro­pean na­tion af­ter Bri­tain to reach 50,000 deaths from the pan­demic as gov­ern­ments across the con­ti­nent strug­gle to im­pose re­stric­tions on pub­lic life while al­low­ing fam­i­lies to cel­e­brate Christ­mas with­out fur­ther fuelling out­breaks.</p>
    <p>While a na­tional lock­down in Eng­land is due to end next week, Ger­many, Spain and Italy have all an­nounced re­stric­tions over the hol­i­day pe­riod, in­clud­ing lim­its on house guests.</p>
    <p>Ger­man Chan­cel­lor An­gela Merkel called on Europe’s ski re­sorts to close this win­ter to halt the spread of the ill­ness. The coun­try reg­is­tered a record in­crease in new virus cases yes­ter­day, bring­ing the to­tal to just un­der one mil­lion, hours af­ter the govern­ment ex­tended a par­tial shut­down to check the dis­ease’s spread.</p>
    <p>The Latin Amer­i­can re­gion has the high­est num­ber of re­ported deaths in the world, rep­re­sent­ing about 21 per cent of all global cases and over 31 per cent of all global deaths re­ported.</p>
    <p>Brazil last week joined the US and In­dia as the only coun­tries to have recorded more than six mil­lion in­fec­tions.</p>
    <p>With 170,769 con­firmed fa­tal­i­ties as at yes­ter­day, Brazil has the world’s sec­ond-high­est death toll.</p>
    <p>While In­dia re­mains the sec­ond­worst af­fected coun­try i n the world with 9.2 mil­lion cases, it has con­tin­ued to re­port a slow­down in new cases in re­cent weeks. It has re­ported an av­er­age of around 44,000 cases a day over the past week, well down from a peak of just un­der 97,900 cases in midSeptem­ber.</p>
    <p>Asia-Pa­cific coun­tries such as China, South Korea, Sin­ga­pore, Aus­tralia and New Zealand have shown how rapid, lo­cal and in­tru­sive steps can be ef­fec­tive in ex­tin­guish­ing out­breaks.</p>
    <p>In a raw but op­ti­mistic ad­dress to Amer­i­cans, US Pres­i­dent-elect Joe Bi­den on Wed­nes­day pleaded with the na­tion to “hang on” and have hope even with the num­ber of coronaviru­s cases spik­ing across the coun­try and a hard win­ter on the hori­zon.</p>
    <p>“Look­ing back over our his­tory, you see that it’s been in the most dif­fi­cult cir­cum­stances that the soul of our na­tion has been forged,” Mr Bi­den said, speak­ing di­rectly to the cam­era from a stage at the Queen, a his­toric the­atre in Wilmington, Delaware.</p>
    <p>He urged Amer­i­cans to see it as their pa­tri­otic duty to fight the pan­demic to­gether by tak­ing the proper pre­cau­tions.</p>
    <p>“I know the coun­try has grown weary of the fight,” he said. “We need to re­mem­ber we’re at war with the virus, not with one an­other, not with each other.”</p>
    <p>Mr Bi­den de­scribed the coronaviru­s pan­demic as “a nearly year­long bat­tle” that has “dev­as­tated this na­tion”.</p>
    <p>“Amer­ica is not go­ing to lose this war,” he said, as he ad­dressed Amer­i­cans. “Don’t let your­self sur­ren­der to the fa­tigue.”</p>
