    <p>More Covid-19 cases could arise among mi­grant work­ers in dorms over the next few days be­cause more will be tested af­ter com­plet­ing their iso­la­tion pe­riod, the Min­istry of Health (MOH) said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Some of the work­ers come from dor­mi­to­ries with a higher preva­lence of Covid-19 in­fec­tion, which is ex­pected to lead to a higher num­ber of cases, it added.</p>
    <p>More than 215,000 work­ers have been tested and cleared so far – around two-thirds of those liv­ing in dorms, MOH noted.</p>
    <p>These work­ers have ei­ther re­cov­ered from Covid-19 or were found to be free of in­fec­tion.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore is on track to clear about 80 per cent of work­ers in dorms by the end of this month and for all to be tested by the mid­dle of next month.</p>
    <p>“Work is on­go­ing to pre­pare these dor­mi­to­ries to be de­clared cleared, and for work­ers to re­sume work,” MOH said.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, the Min­istry of Man­power (MOM) said yes­ter­day that 193 more dorms have been cleared, bring­ing the to­tal to 818.</p>
    <p>They in­clude Mandai Lodge, the eighth pur­pose-built dorm (PBD) to have all its blocks fully cleared of the coro­n­avirus.</p>
    <p>Three of its blocks are among the 19 re­ported cleared as of yes­ter­day to house re­cov­ered work­ers in eight PBDs, bring­ing the to­tal num­ber of such blocks that have been cleared to 59.</p>
    <p>There are 43 PBDs in to­tal.</p>
    <p>The other seven PBDs that have been cleared are Brani Res­i­dence, Cen­tral Staff Apart­ments, Jurong Apart­ments, Pasir Panjang Res­i­dence, Seatown Dor­mi­tory, Space@Tuas and Westlite Ju­niper.</p>
    <p>Of­fi­cials have also cleared 170 fac­tory-con­verted dor­mi­to­ries and 22 con­struc­tion tem­po­rary quar­ters.</p>
    <p>Some cleared work­ers are wait­ing to be moved to ap­pro­pri­ate ac­com­mo­da­tion be­fore they can re­sume work.</p>
    <p>Oth­ers will be able to start their jobs once the three steps re­quired by MOM to min­imise the risk of new in­fec­tions have been put in place.</p>
    <p>Dorm op­er­a­tors must first ar­range stag­gered pick-up and dropoff times for work­ers with their em­ploy­ers.</p>
    <p>Em­ploy­ers must also con­firm or up­date the res­i­den­tial ad­dresses of staff on the MOM data­base.</p>
    <p>And third, work­ers must down­load the TraceTo­gether app to fa­cil­i­tate con­tact trac­ing and the FWMOMCare mo­bile app to up­date their health sta­tus and res­i­dence. These de­tails must match those in their em­ploy­ers’ and dor­mi­tory op­er­a­tors’ records.</p>
    <p>Most of the dor­mi­to­ries com­pleted these steps in a week or less, said MOM.</p>
    <p>The min­istry added that the for­ward as­sur­ance and sup­port teams (Fast) – con­sist­ing of sol­diers, po­lice and MOM of­fi­cers de­ployed to the dorms – are work­ing closely with dorm op­er­a­tors, em­ploy­ers and mi­grant work­ers to com­plete the nec­es­sary steps and clear re­main­ing dor­mi­to­ries.</p>
    <p>It ad­vised em­ploy­ers to re­fer to the MOM web­site for the lat­est list of cleared dor­mi­to­ries, and for those sched­uled to be cleared in the com­ing weeks.</p>
    <p>The web­site said the or­der in which blocks and dor­mi­to­ries are to be cleared is based on var­i­ous fac­tors, in­clud­ing the num­ber of re­cov­ered work­ers orig­i­nally from the dorm and the spread of Covid-19 there.</p>
    <p>The tim­ing of clear­ances may also be re­vised, de­pend­ing on whether mul­ti­ple tests need to be done for a worker or how strin­gently safe dis­tanc­ing mea­sures are ob­served.</p>
    <p>“As we con­tinue to grad­u­ally re­sume work, we urge all dor­mi­tory op­er­a­tors, em­ploy­ers and work­ers to re­main vig­i­lant,” MOM said yes­ter­day, adding that safe work­ing and liv­ing mea­sures should be rig­or­ously fol­lowed.</p>
