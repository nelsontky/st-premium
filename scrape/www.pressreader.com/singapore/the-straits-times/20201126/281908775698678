    <p>WASH­ING­TON • United States En­vi­ron­men­tal Pro­tec­tion Agency (EPA) chief An­drew Wheeler is can­celling a planned trip to Tai­wan next month that had threat­ened to stoke anger with Bei­jing, af­ter con­cerns were raised about the costs of the travel near the end of the Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion.</p>
    <p>“Due to press­ing do­mes­tic pri­or­i­ties at home, Ad­min­is­tra­tor Wheeler’s visit to Tai­wan has been post­poned,” EPA spokesman James He­witt said on Tues­day in an e-mail.</p>
    <p>Mr Wheeler’s trip was orig­i­nally planned fol­low­ing sev­eral high­level vis­its by US of­fi­cials to Tai­wan in re­cent months as well as stepped-up arms sales that have an­gered China.</p>
    <p>Tai­wan re­gret­ted the can­cel­la­tion, For­eign Min­istry spokesman Joanne Ou said in a text mes­sage yes­ter­day, adding that Taipei would con­tinue to pro­mote fu­ture Cab­i­net-level vis­its and col­lab­o­ra­tion on en­vi­ron­men­tal is­sues with the in­com­ing Bi­den ad­min­is­tra­tion.</p>
    <p>The visit had drawn scru­tiny for its po­ten­tially high price tag, with a char­ter flight planned to ferry Mr Wheeler and other EPA staff to the is­land due to coro­n­avirus con­cerns.</p>
    <p>A sep­a­rate trip by Mr Wheeler to Latin Amer­i­can coun­tries, in­clud­ing pos­si­bly Costa Rica and the Do­mini­can Repub­lic, is still ex­pected just ahead of Pres­i­dent-elect Joe Bi­den’s in­au­gu­ra­tion on Jan 20.</p>
    <p>Mr He­witt said the EPA would be ask­ing the agency’s In­spec­torGen­eral to probe the dis­clo­sure of details sur­round­ing Mr Wheeler’s Tai­wan travel plans, af­ter a New York Times re­port on the cost con­cerns.</p>
    <p>“It is dis­turb­ing that a gov­ern­ment of­fi­cial would leak de­lib­er­a­tive sched­ules to The New York Times that could jeop­ar­dise both in­ter­na­tional diplo­macy and per­sonal se­cu­rity,” Mr He­witt said.</p>
    <p>In Au­gust, Health and Hu­man Ser­vices Sec­re­tary Alex Azar be­came the high­est-rank­ing US of­fi­cial to travel to Tai­wan since the coun­try broke off ties with Taipei in 1979. Un­der­sec­re­tary of State Keith Krach vis­ited Tai­wan a month later.</p>
    <p>Both of those vis­its spurred an­gry re­ac­tions from Bei­jing, with Tai­wan a fo­cal point for spi­ralling ten­sions be­tween the US and China. Bei­jing con­sid­ers Tai­wan part of its ter­ri­tory and re­sists any recog­ni­tion of its de facto in­de­pen­dence.</p>
    <p>And, as the US in­creases arms sales, China has vowed to take “nec­es­sary mea­sures” to up­hold its sovereignt­y and se­cu­rity in­ter­ests, while urg­ing the US to cease mil­i­tary con­tact with Tai­wan.</p>
    <p>Mr Wheeler had been in­vited to Tai­wan to col­lab­o­rate on en­vi­ron­men­tal is­sues, in­clud­ing air qual­ity and marine lit­ter.</p>
    <p>The trip was planned amid bi­par­ti­san US ef­forts to strengthen re­la­tions with Tai­wan.</p>
