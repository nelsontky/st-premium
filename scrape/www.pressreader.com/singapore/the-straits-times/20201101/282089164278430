    <p>Sin­ga­pore­ans will wel­come the an­nounce­ment that live per­for­mances can be held at per­form­ing arts venues and the premises of or­ches­tras, choirs, dance groups and other arts and cul­ture or­gan­i­sa­tions from to­day. Art gal­leries, some mu­se­ums, com­mu­nity cen­tres, and ho­tel ball­rooms and func­tion rooms are among the venues al­lowed to re­sume live per­for­mances, ac­cord­ing to the Na­tional Arts Coun­cil. For the pub­lic and the per­form­ers, this re­lax­ation of mea­sures to con­tain the spread of Covid-19 will serve to re­store a de­gree of nor­malcy to the aes­thetic mo­men­tum of their lives, which was in­ter­rupted rudely by the ad­vent of the coro­n­avirus pan­demic.</p>
    <p>It was not un­til live per­for­mances re­ceded into the back­ground that Sin­ga­pore­ans be­gan to miss them. The­atre, for ex­am­ple, is noth­ing if it is not a face-to-face ex­pe­ri­ence. The phys­i­cal prox­im­ity of the au­di­ence to a per­for­mance is as much a part of a per­for­mance as the process of writ­ing, di­rect­ing or stag­ing it. When the au­di­ence watches a per­for­mance, it im­bues ac­tors with a sense of im­me­di­acy, of be­long­ing to a phys­i­cal com­mu­nity which shares its stake in the ac­tive role of art in life. Per­form­ing for a vir­tual au­di­ence on video can­not repli­cate the live re­la­tion­ship be­tween stage and floor.</p>
    <p>So it is too with mu­si­cal per­for­mances. Ear­lier this year, the Ber­lin Phil­har­monic pro­ceeded with a con­cert that had been sched­uled be­fore the ar­rival of the coro­n­avirus by pro­duc­ing a live-streamed per­for­mance in an empty hall. It paid mov­ing trib­ute to the tri­umph of art and tech­nol­ogy over chance and dis­ease. But the ex­pe­ri­ence of that con­cert for both per­form­ers and the au­di­ence was di­min­ished by dis­tance. It was the same in other coun­tries, in­clud­ing Sin­ga­pore, where art lovers were dis­tanced from per­for­mances in beloved venues.</p>
    <p>The re­sump­tion of live per­for­mances rep­re­sents there­fore a re­newal of the artis­tic life of this na­tion. There is a vi­tal need for Sin­ga­pore­ans to ob­serve safe dis­tanc­ing mea­sures that would make it pos­si­ble for the arts to flour­ish in the new nor­mal.</p>
