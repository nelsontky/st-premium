    <p>A You can get an overview of the labour mar­ket’s per­for­mance through the labour mar­ket re­ports.</p>
    <p>They con­tain in­di­ca­tors such as unemployme­nt rates, re­trench­ments, the ra­tio of job va­can­cies to un­em­ployed peo­ple, and the rate of re-en­try into em­ploy­ment within six months of be­ing re­trenched.</p>
    <p>They also have data on which sec­tors saw em­ploy­ment and job va­can­cies in­crease or de­crease.</p>
    <p>The re­ports can be found on the Min­istry of Man­power (MOM) web­site un­der the “Sta­tis­tics and pub­li­ca­tions” sec­tion.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, the weekly jobs sit­u­a­tion re­ports have in­for­ma­tion on job, trainee­ship, at­tach­ment and train­ing op­por­tu­ni­ties that are be­ing cre­ated un­der the SGUnited Jobs and Skills Pack­age.</p>
    <p>The re­ports usu­ally zoom in on in­di­vid­ual sec­tors, such as food, elec­tron­ics and pro­fes­sional ser­vices, and also pro­vide salary in­for­ma­tion for jobs there. They can be found un­der the “Press re­leases” sec­tion of the MOM web­site.</p>
    <p>FOR JOB SEEK­ERS</p>
    <p>Keep­ing an open mind and re­fer­ring to the sec­tors with more op­por­tu­ni­ties to guide your job search would in­crease your chances of find­ing a role, says an MOM spokesman.</p>
    <p>The jobs sit­u­a­tion re­ports high­light skills in de­mand in var­i­ous sec­tors, in­clud­ing trans­fer­able skills that you may al­ready have that you can high­light in your cur­ricu­lum vitae when ap­ply­ing for a job, adds the spokesman.</p>
    <p>You could also take up train­ing cour­ses to gain ad­di­tional skills.</p>
    <p>The salary ranges and case stud­ies of work­ers who have gone through reskilling – both are in the jobs sit­u­a­tion re­ports – pro­vide a glimpse of what to ex­pect if you de­cide to take up sim­i­lar roles, which can help in your dis­cus­sions with em­ploy­ers, says the spokesman.</p>
    <p>FOR EM­PLOY­ERS</p>
    <p>You can use the re­ports to un­der­stand the cur­rent em­ploy­ment land­scape as well as com­pare it with past trends to help make busi­ness de­ci­sions, says the MOM spokesman.</p>
    <p>For ex­am­ple, the unemployme­nt rates re­flected in past labour mar­ket re­ports in­di­cate the base­line unemployme­nt rate.</p>
    <p>Given that the res­i­dent unemployme­nt rate in De­cem­ber last year was 3.2 per cent, the in­crease in the cur­rent unemployme­nt rate from that base­line in­di­cates slack in the labour mar­ket. You can cal­i­brate your hir­ing ap­proach ac­cord­ingly.</p>
    <p>In gen­eral, with more lo­cals seek­ing jobs, it should be eas­ier to find lo­cal hires com­pared with when the labour mar­ket was tighter.</p>
    <p>Not ev­ery­one will be a per­fect fit for the job role. You would have to be pre­pared to take in work­ers with less rel­e­vant back­ground ex­pe­ri­ence, and train and groom them, says the spokesman. The jobs sit­u­a­tion re­ports high­light gov­ern­ment sup­port schemes for this.</p>
    <p>Even in a slack labour mar­ket, you can make your job va­can­cies more at­trac­tive by con­sid­er­ing the wage of­fered, work­ing hours and flex­i­bil­ity, adds the spokesman.</p>
    <p>Q What other free tools can I use in my job search?</p>
    <p>A The MyCa­reer­sFu­ture.sg por­tal is a job board you can use to search for op­por­tu­ni­ties, es­pe­cially those el­i­gi­ble for gov­ern­ment sup­port.</p>
    <p>For ex­am­ple, you can fil­ter op­por­tu­ni­ties to see those that are un­der pro­fes­sional con­ver­sion pro­grammes which can help you switch to a new oc­cu­pa­tion, or those el­i­gi­ble for train­ing al­lowances un­der the SGUnited Trainee­ships Pro­gramme or MidCa­reer Path­ways Pro­gramme.</p>
    <p>If you cre­ate a pro­file in the por­tal and list your skills, the job posts in your search re­sults will in­di­cate how well matched your skills are to those the em­ployer has in­di­cated. You will also re­ceive rec­om­men­da­tions of other job posts based on your listed skills.</p>
    <p>You can choose to make your pro­file “open to op­por­tu­ni­ties”, which means all em­ploy­ers can search for your pro­file and con­tact you.</p>
    <p>The por­tal also pro­vides vir­tual ca­reer guid­ance in the “Seek Ca­reer Ad­vice” sec­tion. There are write­ups on dif­fer­ent in­dus­tries, tips on land­ing a job and ad­vice on grow­ing your ca­reer.</p>
    <p>Down­load­able work­books can be found un­der the “Get Ca­reer Clar­ity” tab, which guide you through iden­ti­fy­ing your val­ues, in­ter­ests, per­son­al­ity and skills and analysing job po­si­tions you are in­ter­ested in.</p>
    <p>LinkedIn also has in­ter­view prepa­ra­tion tips with sug­gested frame­works for an­swer­ing com­monly asked ques­tions. You can get ar­ti­fi­cial in­tel­li­gence-pow­ered feed­back after record­ing a prac­tice video re­sponse. The fea­ture can be found via the Jobs tab im­me­di­ately after you ap­ply for a job, or via the Jobs Tracker dash­board when you view jobs you have ap­plied for.</p>
    <p>If you are re­search­ing the skills you need to progress in your ca­reer or move into a new field, re­fer to skills frame­works at www.skill­sfu­ture.sg/skills-frame­work</p>
    <p>They are cre­ated by the Gov­ern­ment and in­dus­try stake­hold­ers such as em­ploy­ers, unions and ed­u­ca­tion and train­ing providers.</p>
    <p>There are 34 in­dus­tries cov­ered so far, in­clud­ing fi­nan­cial ser­vices and so­cial ser­vice.</p>
    <p>Each frame­work lists ca­reer path­ways, al­low­ing you to iden­tify ver­ti­cal and lat­eral ad­vance­ment op­por­tu­ni­ties; skill maps of tech­ni­cal and generic skills for dif­fer­ent oc­cu­pa­tions in the in­dus­try; and train­ing pro­grammes.</p>
