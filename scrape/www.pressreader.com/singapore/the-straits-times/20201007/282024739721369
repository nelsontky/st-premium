    <p>The Min­istry of Man­power’s de­ci­sion to re­view penalties for the il­le­gal de­ploy­ment of maids and stiff penalties for those who abuse bus driv­ers are two sep­a­rate but re­lated ex­am­ples of the need to treat work­ers, whether do­mes­tic or pub­lic, fairly and with re­spect. The min­istry says that ac­tion will be taken against em­ploy­ers in cases sim­i­lar to the one in­volv­ing for­mer maid Parti Liyani, re­gard­less of whether they are aware of the il­le­gal de­ploy­ment. The is­sue is not a small one. The min­istry re­ceived about 550 com­plaints of il­le­gal de­ploy­ment each year from 2017 to last year. Of these, an av­er­age of 155 em­ploy­ers were warned or fined. It is nec­es­sary to strengthen the de­ter­rent frame­work to deal with em­ploy­ers who are un­mind­ful of the fact that they are ac­count­able for their for­eign do­mes­tic work­ers.</p>
    <p>Quite apart from ques­tions of le­gal re­spon­si­bil­ity, the point is a hu­man­i­tar­ian one. En­sur­ing the well-be­ing of maids, who con­trib­ute ef­fi­ciently and silently to the smooth run­ning of fam­i­lies, rep­re­sents the em­ploy­ers’ end of the con­trac­tual bar­gain, just as the do­mes­tic work­ers are ex­pected to ful­fil their du­ties at their end. Most em­ploy­ers un­der­stand and ob­serve this prin­ci­ple of rec­i­proc­ity, but some do not. Their ac­tions should not be al­lowed to cast as­per­sions on so­ci­ety at large by sug­gest­ing that for­eign do­mes­tic work­ers are ex­ploited be­cause they come from abroad and are not well-off. That is not the kind of so­ci­ety Sin­ga­pore is or should ever be­come. At heart, the is­sue is an at­ti­tu­di­nal one: whether an em­ployer con­sid­ers an em­ployee to be a per­son with rights along with re­spon­si­bil­i­ties, or whether labour is viewed in terms of ex­ploita­tive dif­fer­ences in so­cial sta­tus and eco­nomic power.</p>
    <p>A sim­i­larly at­ti­tu­di­nal el­e­ment per­haps af­fects the re­la­tion­ship be­tween bus driv­ers and com­muters. A rise in cases of ver­bal and phys­i­cal abuse of bus driv­ers by com­muters who did not wear a mask, which is manda­tory, draws at­ten­tion to a woe­ful lack of civic con­scious­ness that spilled over into the com­pletely un­ac­cept­able use of vi­o­lence. The driv­ers were do­ing their job as pub­lic trans­port work­ers. Ev­ery day, rain or shine, their labour helps to make eco­nomic and so­cial life pos­si­ble for Sin­ga­pore­ans who do not own cars. Pub­lic trans­port, as its name says, is a pub­lic good. Work­ers should be com­mended for their ded­i­ca­tion to duty, which has been put to the test by the coro­n­avirus pan­demic but has emerged un­scathed. Abu­sive be­hav­iour to­wards them be­smirches the qual­ity of pub­lic life in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>It is good, there­fore, that would-be of­fend­ers have been put on no­tice that they will face the full force of the law. The pun­ish­ment can in­clude up to three years in jail when convicted of vol­un­tar­ily caus­ing hurt. That the treat­ment of work­ers has been taken up in Par­lia­ment sends a stern sig­nal.</p>
