    <p>A re­cent study in Aus­tralia found that the Covid-19 virus can sur­vive on ban­knotes, glass and stain­less steel for up to 28 days. It can also re­main in­fec­tious for 28 days on smooth sur­faces such as plas­tic and mo­bile phone screens.</p>
    <p>The Straits Times out­lines the im­pli­ca­tions of these find­ings, and the pre­cau­tions peo­ple should take.</p>
    <p>Q What are the im­pli­ca­tions of this study?</p>
    <p>A It is im­por­tant to keep in mind that these stud­ies are per­formed un­der ideal con­di­tions, where the temperatur­e, light and hu­mid­ity in the lab can be con­trolled.</p>
    <p>Dr Danielle An­der­son, sci­en­tific di­rec­tor of the Duke-NUS Med­i­cal School ABSL3 lab­o­ra­tory, said that in the real world, virus trans­mis­sion from a sur­face to a per­son can be dis­turbed. For ex­am­ple, if an MRT pole has been con­tam­i­nated, virus par­ti­cles can be trans­ferred to the hands of someone who touches it. But if this per­son sani­tises his hands af­ter­wards, the virus can be killed, and the trans­mis­sion is bro­ken.</p>
    <p>Pro­fes­sor Dale Fisher, se­nior con­sul­tant at the di­vi­sion of in­fec­tious dis­eases at the Na­tional Univer­sity Hospi­tal, noted that trans­mis­sion via con­tam­i­nated sur­faces does oc­cur but it is not the dom­i­nant route. Stud­ies demon­strate the pos­si­bil­ity of such trans­mis­sion, but do not prove it.</p>
    <p>Q What is the risk of be­ing in­fected by touch­ing sur­faces that have been touched by an in­fected per­son?</p>
    <p>A Prof Fisher said that while it is dif­fi­cult to quan­tify risk, there needs to be “ad­e­quate vi­able virus” for trans­mis­sion to oc­cur via a con­tam­i­nated sur­face.</p>
    <p>For in­stance, an in­di­vid­ual would need to touch the con­tam­i­nated sur­face, and then his eyes or mouth, but each move­ment would di­lute the virus num­ber.</p>
    <p>Since the max­i­mum amount of virus is in the throats of those in­fected, there will be less of the virus on sur­faces they have touched, and even less in the next per­son’s eyes and throat.</p>
    <p>Di­rect droplet trans­fer from per­son to per­son will carry more of the virus and has a higher like­li­hood of trans­mis­sion.</p>
    <p>Q</p>
    <p>Should I be wor­ried about touch­ing the same sur­faces as an in­fec­tious per­son?</p>
    <p>A No, as the risk of trans­mis­sion is very low, es­pe­cially in Sin­ga­pore which has few com­mu­nity cases.</p>
    <p>For safety, peo­ple should still hold handrails on stair­cases and MRT trains, said Prof Fisher, but it is im­por­tant to prac­tise good hand hy­giene. Peo­ple should con­tinue to sani­tise and wash their hands reg­u­larly, and avoid touch­ing their faces as much as pos­si­ble.</p>
    <p>Q Should I avoid touch­ing money?</p>
    <p>A No, as the risk of be­ing in­fected from touch­ing ban­knotes is low. But if you are wor­ried, you can opt for con­tact­less pay­ment meth­ods as much as pos­si­ble.</p>
    <p>Q What safety pre­cau­tions should I take when us­ing my mo­bile phone? A Mo­bile phone screens tend to be dirty, sim­ply be­cause we use them all the time.</p>
    <p>If there was an in­fected per­son touch­ing sur­faces on the train for in­stance, and you touch the same sur­faces, and then use your phone be­fore sani­tis­ing your hands, there is a pos­si­bil­ity of the virus stay­ing on the phone’s sur­face, said Dr An­der­son. To be safe, sani­tise your phones with dis­in­fec­tant wipes where pos­si­ble, and avoid us­ing them during meals.</p>
    <p>Q</p>
    <p>Should I be wor­ried about going to the air­port, and pos­si­bly touch­ing the same sur­faces as an in­fected per­son?</p>
    <p>A With trav­ellers of­ten min­gling at the air­port, there tends to be a higher risk of in­fec­tion, but with sur­faces reg­u­larly dis­in­fected and peo­ple prac­tis­ing good hy­giene, the risk is min­imised, said Prof Fisher.</p>
    <p>In ad­di­tion, re­quired test­ing at the time of travel and upon ar­rival in Sin­ga­pore fur­ther helps to en­sure that the risk of in­fect­ing oth­ers while in tran­sit is low, said Dr An­der­son. Even if the in­di­vid­ual tests neg­a­tive at first, and pos­i­tive later on, they are un­likely to be shed­ding enough virus to be in­fect­ing oth­ers.</p>
