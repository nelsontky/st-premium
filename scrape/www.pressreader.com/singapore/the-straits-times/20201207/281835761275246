    <p>With the clock count­ing down to Mr Joe Bi­den’s in­au­gu­ra­tion as the 46th pres­i­dent of the United States next month, the broad con­tours of his trade pol­icy are slowly start­ing to emerge. While Mr Bi­den’s Cab­i­net picks sig­nalled a more in­ter­na­tion­al­ist ap­proach, the Pres­i­dent-elect has been equally clear that his ad­min­is­tra­tion will re­main on the front foot against China, keep­ing up pres­sure for re­forms in trade, tech­nol­ogy and other ar­eas.</p>
    <p>Con­trary to ini­tial ex­pec­ta­tions, the days of “Amer­ica First”, it seems, are not over, but they will be dif­fer­ent – more con­sen­sual, mul­ti­lat­eral and fo­cused on build­ing Amer­ica’s do­mes­tic ca­pac­ity to com­pete in ar­eas such as sci­en­tific re­search and tech­nol­ogy.</p>
    <p>It would be a mis­take, how­ever, to view the fu­ture trade and tech­nol­ogy land­scape purely through the prism of Amer­i­can do­mes­tic in­ter­ests and pol­i­tics. More fun­da­men­tal fac­tors are at play as the golden era of glob­al­i­sa­tion over the past sev­eral decades – based on un­fet­tered move­ment of goods, ser­vices, cap­i­tal and tech­nol­ogy – gives way to a world in­creas­ingly splin­tered along tech­nol­ogy and trade lines. In this world of “techno-na­tion­al­ism”, the con­test be­tween coun­tries is in­creas­ingly fought over tech­nol­ogy, data and in­no­va­tion.</p>
    <p>For ex­am­ple, last year saw a well-pub­li­cised spat over Ja­panese curbs on ex­ports of high-tech­nol­ogy com­po­nents and ma­te­ri­als to South Korea. In­dia has in­tro­duced re­quire­ments for com­pa­nies to store all pay­ments data and some per­sonal data on servers lo­cated in In­dia, a move widely seen as favour­ing do­mes­tic com­pa­nies. In­done­sia, Viet­nam and Rus­sia have sim­i­larly in­tro­duced data lo­cal­i­sa­tion rules.</p>
    <p>And Mr Pas­cal Lamy, ad­dress­ing the 2020 Global Dig­i­tal Trade Con­fer­ence last month, noted that the world now has three ma­jor data-gov­er­nance sys­tems: a US-led one that sees data as mer­chan­dise; a China-cen­tred one where data is largely un­der state con­trol; and a Euro­pean Union-led sys­tem that views data as per­sonal prop­erty.</p>
    <p>Mr Lamy, who was pre­vi­ously the direc­tor-gen­eral of the World Trade Or­gan­i­sa­tion, said he had doubts whether in “this new phase of glob­al­i­sa­tion, data-driven in­ter­na­tional ex­change will re­main open as the pre­vi­ous wave of glob­al­i­sa­tion”, char­ac­terised by the ex­change of goods and ser­vices.</p>
    <p>Three pow­er­ful forces are driv­ing this new era of “techno-na­tion­al­ism”.</p>
    <p>DIG­I­TAL TWINS AND OTHER IN­TAN­GI­BLES</p>
    <p>First, the eco­nom­ics of trade and na­tional com­pet­i­tive­ness are chang­ing. In­ter­na­tional trade is piv­ot­ing away from “stuff” – com­modi­ties and man­u­fac­tured prod­ucts – to­wards high-tech­nol­ogy in­fra­struc­ture, com­po­nents and in­tan­gi­bles such as data and de­signs.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to the United Na­tions Con­fer­ence on Trade and De­vel­op­ment, global ex­ports of in­for­ma­tion tech­nol­ogy goods reached US$1.9 tril­lion</p>
    <p>(S$2.5 tril­lion) in 2017. More than half of to­tal trade in ser­vices is now dig­i­tally en­abled, with ac­tiv­i­ties as</p>
    <p>di­verse as e-com­merce, man­age­ment, sales and mar­ket­ing, back-of­fice ad­min­is­tra­tion, finance, ed­u­ca­tion and R&D de­liv­er­able di­rectly over the In­ter­net or via elec­tronic plat­forms such as eBay.</p>
    <p>Tra­di­tional ar­gu­ments for global trade were rooted in the idea of strong mu­tual gains – in in­comes, jobs and tech­nol­ogy trans­fer – when na­tions traded goods and ser­vices. Yet, the new tech­nol­ogy mar­kets tend to have strong “win­ner-takes-all” char­ac­ter­is­tics which can blunt in­cen­tives for co­op­er­a­tion and trade. One rea­son is sim­ply the net­work ef­fect – many con­sumers will grav­i­tate to­wards a par­tic­u­lar so­cial me­dia or e-com­merce plat­form be­cause that is where most of their con­nec­tions al­ready are.</p>
    <p>An­other is about data: Ar­ti­fi­cial in­tel­li­gence (AI) al­go­rithms get bet­ter and bet­ter the more data they crunch, giv­ing a huge ad­van­tage to in­cum­bents that can mine vast troves of data. Con­sider for a mo­ment that Google has 90 per cent of the global In­ter­net search mar­ket, Face­book 66 per cent of the global so­cial me­dia mar­ket, and WeChat more than</p>
    <p>one bil­lion users.</p>
    <p>As a re­sult, na­tions are jostling for supremacy in next-wave tech­nolo­gies such as au­ton­o­mous ve­hi­cles, ro­bot­ics, ma­chine learn­ing, 3D print­ing and fi­nan­cial tech­nol­ogy.</p>
    <p>An­other key bat­tle­ground could be dig­i­tal twins – dig­i­tal repli­cas of an ob­ject, place or per­son that have the same phys­i­cal prop­er­ties as the real thing and that can be ma­nip­u­lated re­motely. Dig­i­tal twins are be­ing cre­ated for air­craft en­gines, for cities, even for hu­man or­gans such as the heart. Thus, they will be key to na­tions seek­ing to spur faster in­no­va­tion and pro­duc­tiv­ity growth and achieve en­vi­ron­men­tal and so­cial goals.</p>
    <p>The eco­nomic stakes are ex­traor­di­nar­ily high. Con­sider that in 2008, the world’s largest com­pa­nies were, by and large, in the en­ergy and re­sources sec­tors. To­day, it is the global tech­nol­ogy giants, from the US and China, that sit atop the global leader board.</p>
    <p>NA­TIONAL SE­CU­RITY CON­CERNS</p>
    <p>Sec­ond, the na­tional se­cu­rity di­men­sion looms large in any dis­cus­sion of the fu­ture of trade in</p>
    <p>gen­eral and China-US re­la­tions in par­tic­u­lar. Of par­tic­u­lar con­cern here is the grow­ing role of dual-use tech­nol­ogy: tech­nol­ogy that has both civil­ian and mil­i­tary uses. The prob­lem is that nearly ev­ery ad­vanced tech­nol­ogy to­day po­ten­tially has a dual use, with the US cur­rently re­view­ing whether to ex­pand ex­port con­trols to a swathe of emerg­ing tech­nolo­gies such as AI, quan­tum com­put­ing and 3D print­ing.</p>
    <p>An early ca­su­alty of the tech war has been the global semi­con­duc­tor in­dus­try, which sup­plies the chips that power nearly ev­ery ad­vanced tech­nol­ogy, from au­ton­o­mous ve­hi­cles to ro­bot­ics to fa­cial recog­ni­tion sys­tems. US high-tech ex­ports to China were re­stricted, while sev­eral high-pro­file in­vest­ments by Chi­nese com­pa­nies in the US tech­nol­ogy sec­tor were blocked on se­cu­rity grounds.</p>
    <p>It is hard to imag­ine that the se­cu­rity di­men­sion of trade won’t ratchet up fur­ther in the next decade, when we po­ten­tially have code-break­ing quan­tum com­put­ers, au­ton­o­mous drones with fa­cial-recog­ni­tion abil­ity, or tech­nol­ogy-aug­mented “su­per sol­diers”.</p>
    <p>IM­PACT OF THE PAN­DEMIC</p>
    <p>Third, the in­flu­ence of the global pan­demic can­not be ig­nored. The early days of the pan­demic were marked by an un­seemly blame game and oc­ca­sional in­flam­ma­tory rhetoric by Western politi­cians and me­dia.</p>
    <p>What is un­de­ni­able, how­ever, is that the ex­pe­ri­ence of the pan­demic has spurred new think­ing among busi­nesses and pol­i­cy­mak­ers: about food and en­ergy se­cu­rity; about short­ages of es­sen­tial sup­plies and equip­ment; about the move­ment of peo­ple and goods; and about the risks of highly in­ter­wo­ven, just-in-time global sup­ply chains.</p>
    <p>A new nar­ra­tive around na­tional self-suf­fi­ciency may well start to fuse with the broader po­lit­i­cal and eco­nomic forces noted above.</p>
    <p>For glob­al­ists, it is not all bad news. In­deed, there may be cause for op­ti­mism in the longer term as some forces of rein­te­gra­tion re­assert them­selves.</p>
    <p>The need to re­store growth to virus-bat­tered economies will be a pow­er­ful in­duce­ment to trade.</p>
    <p>NEW EQUILIBRIU­M BE­TWEEN LO­CAL AND GLOBAL?</p>
    <p>By the end of this decade, the con­stant in­ter­play be­tween tech­nol­ogy and trade may find a new equilibriu­m in terms of what is lo­calised and what is global.</p>
    <p>For ex­am­ple, 3D print­ing of prod­ucts or com­po­nents could mean that more man­u­fac­tur­ing stays at home while the un­der­ly­ing de­signs, ideas and pro­to­types are seam­lessly trans­ferred across bor­ders. It is pos­si­ble to imag­ine a tech­ni­cian in Malaysia, for ex­am­ple, op­er­at­ing a 3D printer for elec­tric ve­hi­cles based on soft­ware in­puts out of Tokyo.</p>
    <p>Highly re­al­is­tic holo­gram tech­nol­ogy, with­out head­sets, could be used to ex­port ser­vices such as ed­u­ca­tion or medicine – the teacher or doc­tor stays put while the skills travel.</p>
    <p>Per­haps the big­gest game changer could be what is known as edge com­put­ing. To­day, most of us have a sig­nif­i­cant amount of data stored and pro­cessed in “the cloud” – mas­sive data servers op­er­ated cen­trally. But 5G tech­nol­ogy needs data trans­mis­sion and stor­age to be much closer to the de­vice it­self – your smart­phone or au­ton­o­mous car, for ex­am­ple. This de­cen­tral­i­sa­tion of data will make it harder for gov­ern­ments to con­trol data.</p>
    <p>So it is just pos­si­ble that by the end of this decade, tech­no­log­i­cal forces of in­te­gra­tion will re­gain the up­per hand. But, in the mean­time, the mes­sage for busi­ness is this: Don’t count on these techno-na­tion­al­is­tic fric­tions eas­ing any time soon. Busi­nesses should con­tinue to plan for a sig­nif­i­cant de­gree of dis­rup­tion, un­cer­tainty and frag­men­ta­tion.</p>
