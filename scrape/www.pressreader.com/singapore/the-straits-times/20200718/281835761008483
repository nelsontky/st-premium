    <p>Mary­land Gov­er­nor Larry Ho­gan on Thurs­day be­came the first Repub­li­can politi­cian to openly, via an op-ed in The Wash­ing­ton Post, flay Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump’s re­sponse to the coro­n­avirus pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Mr Ho­gan’s tale points to fun­da­men­tal un­der­ly­ing rea­sons for the United States’ fail­ure to curb the spread of Covid-19 – its de­cen­tralised na­ture, lack of trust in fed­eral gov­ern­ment, toxic po­lit­i­cal and ide­o­log­i­cal di­vi­sions, and, in some quar­ters, dis­trust of science.</p>
    <p>DE­CEN­TRALISED AND DOWN­PLAYED</p>
    <p>South Korean Pres­i­dent Moon Jae-in helped Mr Ho­gan find and buy a planeload of half a mil­lion test kits, which landed at Mary­land’s Bal­ti­more-Wash­ing­ton In­ter­na­tional Mar­shall Air­port on a Korean Air plane af­ter a 14-hour flight from Seoul.</p>
    <p>It was April 18. The coro­n­avirus had by then in­fected 12,308 Mary­lan­ders and killed 463 of them.</p>
    <p>“Across the coun­try, my fel­low gov­er­nors were des­per­ately plead­ing for help on test­ing,” Mr Ho­gan wrote.</p>
    <p>“But in early April, Mr Trump said it was the states’ job.”</p>
    <p>Ear­lier, Pres­i­dent Trump down­played the threat. Asked about it in Davos, Switzer­land, on Jan 22, he told CNBC an­chor Joe Ker­nen: “We have it to­tally un­der con­trol.”</p>
    <p>Eight days later, on Jan 30, the World Health Or­gan­i­sa­tion de­clared the out­break a public health emer­gency of in­ter­na­tional con­cern.</p>
    <p>“The Pres­i­dent down­played the out­break’s sever­ity and… the White House failed to is­sue public warn­ings, draw up a 50-state strat­egy, or dis­patch med­i­cal gear or life-sav­ing ven­ti­la­tors from the na­tional stock­pile to Amer­i­can hos­pi­tals,” Mr Ho­gan wrote.</p>
    <p>“Eventually, it was clear that wait­ing around for the Pres­i­dent to run the na­tion’s re­sponse was hope­less,” he wrote.</p>
    <p>“So ev­ery gov­er­nor went their own way, which is how the United States ended up with such a patch­work re­sponse.”</p>
    <p>TRAVEL BANS IN­AD­E­QUATE</p>
    <p>On Jan 31, as Chi­nese health of­fi­cials re­ported ap­prox­i­mately 10,000 con­firmed Covid-19 cases, the White House banned the en­try into the US of all aliens phys­i­cally present within the Peo­ple’s Repub­lic of China, ex­clud­ing Hong Kong and Ma­cau. Mr Trump had touted this ban as a crit­i­cal in­ter­ven­tion that saved lives.</p>
    <p>It may have saved some lives, ex­perts con­cede. But travel en­try records and avi­a­tion data ob­tained by The As­so­ci­ated Press showed that nearly 8,000 Chi­nese na­tion­als and for­eign res­i­dents of</p>
    <p>Hong Kong and Ma­cau en­tered the US on more than 600 com­mer­cial and pri­vate flights in the first three months af­ter the ban, so it was far from per­fect.</p>
    <p>The US also re­stricted travel from Europe on March 13. But that ban came too late – by March 15, com­mu­nity trans­mis­sion was al­ready wide­spread in New York City, ac­cord­ing to a new re­port by the US Cen­tres for Dis­ease Con­trol and Pre­ven­tion (CDC).</p>
    <p>TEST KITS, FACE MASK FAIL­URES</p>
    <p>In early Fe­bru­ary, a batch of test kits man­u­fac­tured for the CDC was found to be con­tam­i­nated and not work­ing. It took weeks to make a new batch. The US lost pre­cious time in track­ing the spread of the coro­n­avirus.</p>
    <p>The fed­eral gov­ern­ment told the gen­eral public that face masks would not help stop the spread of the coro­n­avirus – ad­vice that ran counter to the ex­pe­ri­ence of many coun­tries in Asia.</p>
    <p>The real rea­son for this ad­vice, which was not clear in of­fi­cial an­nounce­ments, was that a run on masks would de­prive those who needed it most – front-line health and med­i­cal pro­fes­sion­als who were labour­ing in cri­sis con­di­tions with crit­i­cal short­ages of per­sonal pro­tec­tive equip­ment (PPE).</p>
    <p>Mr Trump’s in­vo­ca­tion of the De­fence Pro­duc­tion Act in early April did ramp up pro­duc­tion of PPE and life-sav­ing ven­ti­la­tors, but it could have been done much ear­lier.</p>
    <p>The re­sult – the public was mis­in­formed about the ef­fi­cacy of masks. To­day, of­fi­cials have done a com­plete turn­around and ad­vo­cate masks, but there is still no fed­eral, coun­try­wide or­der, and it is still up to in­di­vid­ual states.</p>
    <p>POL­I­TICS AND CON­SPIR­ACY THE­O­RIES</p>
    <p>The Pres­i­dent him­self wore a mask in public for the first time only on July 11, when he toured Wal­ter Reed Na­tional Mil­i­tary Med­i­cal Cen­tre. He had not worn one pre­vi­ously, which had sent a con­tra­dic­tory sig­nal to all the of­fi­cial ad­vice to wear masks.</p>
    <p>The tox­i­c­ity of the po­lit­i­cal di­vide has be­come ev­i­dent, with right-wing con­ser­va­tive Trump sup­port­ers de­rid­ing the wear­ing of masks – and any re­stric­tions – as au­thor­i­tar­i­an­ism. Large swathes of the US pop­u­la­tion have been very late to adopt masks, and in many cases still have not.</p>
    <p>And on Thurs­day, White House press sec­re­tary Kayleigh McE­nany ex­plic­itly said that “science should not stand in the way” of re­open­ing schools.</p>
    <p>PATCH­WORK RE­SPONSE Eventually, it was clear that wait­ing around for the Pres­i­dent to run the na­tion’s re­sponse was hope­less. So ev­ery gov­er­nor went their own way, which is how the United States ended up with such a patch­work re­sponse. ’’</p>

    <p>OPEN­ING UP TOO SOON</p>
    <p>Com­pound­ing all the er­rors and negat­ing the small suc­cesses has been the fact that sev­eral states, ea­ger to get back to busi­ness, had opened up too soon.</p>
    <p>This meant that a pop­u­la­tion frus­trated with weeks of lock­down spilled out and min­gled, of­ten with­out face cov­er­ings, giv­ing Covid-19 a boost that has seen hos­pi­tal­i­sa­tions sky­rock­et­ing again and some states or­der­ing re­frig­er­a­tor trucks to serve as makeshift morgues.</p>
