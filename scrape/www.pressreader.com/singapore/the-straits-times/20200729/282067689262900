    <p>Europe and Asia cur­rently ap­ply very dif­fer­ent poli­cies to­wards leisure travel, both of which are not ideal (Leisure travel un­likely this year or in early 2021 as coun­tries play safe, July 24).</p>
    <p>Many Euro­pean coun­tries let their cit­i­zens go on hol­i­day across Europe and be­yond. This al­lows cit­i­zens to en­joy them­selves and tourist des­ti­na­tions to earn needed money. But it also risks a sec­ond wave of coro­n­avirus in­fec­tions as well as hav­ing cases im­ported back home.</p>
    <p>The Bri­tish gov­ern­ment last week im­posed a two-week quar­an­tine on trav­ellers re­turn­ing from Spain.</p>
    <p>In con­trast, Asian coun­tries, even those with low in­fec­tion num­bers, ban hol­i­day travel over­seas al­to­gether – peo­ple thus can­not have a break, while air­lines and tourist des­ti­na­tions con­tinue to strug­gle.</p>
    <p>But there is a third way that al­lows re­spon­si­ble leisure travel.</p>
    <p>Set up coro­n­avirus test­ing fa­cil­i­ties at air­ports that can pro­duce test re­sults in a few hours, and make test­ing manda­tory be­fore fly­ing.</p>
    <p>Let peo­ple go through Cus­toms af­ter test­ing. They can shop and eat while wait­ing for their test re­sults.</p>
    <p>If a per­son tests pos­i­tive, he can­not fly and will be taken into quar­an­tine or to the hospi­tal. The same ap­plies when peo­ple want to fly home again. So the other coun­try has to ap­ply this same strict pol­icy.</p>
    <p>This would give peo­ple a chance to fly and also pro­vide the right in­cen­tive for them to stay safe while on hol­i­day.</p>
    <p>No­body wants to risk hav­ing to stay longer than planned while over­seas, visit a for­eign hospi­tal or waste the re­turn ticket.</p>
    <p>To man­age the num­ber of peo­ple fly­ing, gov­ern­ments can de­cide which coun­tries are el­i­gi­ble for vis­it­ing and whether peo­ple have to pay for the test.</p>
