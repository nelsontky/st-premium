    <p>SYD­NEY • South Aus­tralia’s six­day lock­down is slated to be lifted ear­lier than planned af­ter it was dis­cov­ered that the man who trig­gered the re­stric­tions had lied to con­tact trac­ers.</p>
    <p>The an­nounce­ment yes­ter­day came just two days af­ter the state gov­ern­ment or­dered peo­ple to stay at home and shut many busi­nesses to com­bat what was con­sid­ered a highly con­ta­gious out­break of coro­n­avirus.</p>
    <p>South Aus­tralia state Pre­mier Steven Mar­shall said at a me­dia con­fer­ence in Ade­laide that the man who tested pos­i­tive told con­tact trac­ers he had only bought a pizza at a pizza shop, when he had ac­tu­ally worked sev­eral shifts there along­side an­other worker who tested pos­i­tive.</p>
    <p>The au­thor­i­ties as­sumed the man, who was not named, had caught the virus dur­ing a very short ex­po­sure at the shop, lead­ing them to be­lieve that the strain must be highly con­ta­gious.</p>
    <p>“Their story didn’t add up. We pur­sued them. We now know that they lied,” Mr Mar­shall told re­porters. “Had this per­son been truth­ful to the con­tact trac­ing teams, we would not have gone into a six-day lock­down.”</p>
    <p>He added: “These self­ish ac­tions of this in­di­vid­ual have put our whole state in a very dif­fi­cult sit­u­a­tion.”</p>
    <p>While the out­break is still a con­cern, he said re­stric­tions would be lifted early – most busi­nesses would be al­lowed to open today.</p>
    <p>Asked what pun­ish­ment the man might face, Po­lice Com­mis­sioner Grant Stevens said there is no penalty for ly­ing to con­tact trac­ers un­der the cur­rent law, but that would likely be re­viewed.</p>
    <p>Mr Stevens would not be drawn on the man’s likely mo­ti­va­tion for mis­lead­ing con­tact trac­ers.</p>
    <p>Home to about 1.8 mil­lion peo­ple, South Aus­tralia has recorded 25 cases from the lat­est clus­ter, linked to a trav­eller who re­turned from Bri­tain.</p>
    <p>The coun­try as a whole has been rel­a­tively suc­cess­ful in con­tain­ing the virus, with around 95 cases cur­rently ac­tive. The state of Vic­to­ria yes­ter­day re­ported its 21st day of zero cases.</p>
