    <p>Dr Chia Kee Seng wrote in his Fo­rum let­ter that “the Work­ers’ Party (WP) is now the only op­po­si­tion party in Par­lia­ment with a record high of 10 elected mem­bers” (Par­lia­ment must rise above party pol­i­tics, July 14).</p>
    <p>Ac­tu­ally, the record holder was the now-de­funct Barisan Sosialis which won 13 of the 46 seats it con­tested in the 1963 Gen­eral Elec­tion for the 51-seat Leg­isla­tive As­sem­bly. The Peo­ple’s Ac­tion Party (PAP) took 37 seats, with the re­main­ing seat go­ing to the United Peo­ple’s Party.</p>
    <p>Sig­nif­i­cantly, ac­cord­ing to The PAP Story – The Pi­o­neer­ing Years by for­mer PAP MP Fong Sip Chee, the vote share fig­ures re­flected the ac­tual strength and ground sup­port of both par­ties at that time.</p>
    <p>The Barisan was the PAP’s strong­est chal­lenger in those tu­mul­tuous days. Since then, there has been no op­po­nent show­ing any po­ten­tial to form an al­ter­na­tive gov­ern­ment. Could the WP be the one? It re­mains to be seen.</p>
    <p>Cer­tainly, the party has done well in GE2020, cap­tur­ing Sengkang GRC, re­tain­ing Alju­nied GRC and Hougang SMC, and hav­ing its sec­re­tary-gen­eral, Mr Pri­tam Singh, ap­pointed Leader of the Op­po­si­tion. That has raised its po­lit­i­cal stand­ing.</p>
    <p>I agree with Dr Chia that, to be con­struc­tive, the WP must go be­yond just pro­vid­ing checks and bal­ances to play­ing ad­vo­cacy and ad­vi­sory roles. And I share his hope that the WP and the PAP will not be ad­ver­saries in and out of Par­lia­ment to show that the House is above party pol­i­tics.</p>
    <p>The bot­tom line is, what mat­ters most is ca­pa­ble lead­er­ship that is able to pro­vide peace, sta­bil­ity, se­cu­rity and more so­cio-eco­nomic growth in the na­tion.</p>
    <p>I am sure Sin­ga­pore­ans want noth­ing less than that.</p>
