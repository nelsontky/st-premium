    <p>LON­DON • Ed­die Howe left his job as Bournemout­h man­ager by mu­tual con­sent on Satur­day, say­ing it was the right time for the club to have a change fol­low­ing their rel­e­ga­tion from the Pre­mier League.</p>
    <p>The Cher­ries’ five-year stint in the English top flight ended on the fi­nal day of the sea­son last month af­ter fin­ish­ing third-bot­tom in the ta­ble with 34 points.</p>
    <p>Howe, 42, de­parted af­ter a dis­cus­sion with Bournemout­h of­fi­cials, the club an­nounced in a state­ment.</p>
    <p>“Hav­ing spent a to­tal of 25 years with the club as both a player and a man­ager, this de­ci­sion – made to­gether with the club – is one of the hard­est I’ve ever had to make,” he said.</p>
    <p>“How­ever, although the af­fec­tion and love I have for this foot­ball club will al­ways re­main, we col­lec­tively feel that now is the right time for the club to go in a new di­rec­tion.</p>
    <p>“I have al­ways en­sured that every de­ci­sion I have ever made as man­ager has been in the best in­ter­ests of the club and its sup­port­ers, and this is no dif­fer­ent.”</p>
    <p>He man­aged Bournemout­h in more than 450 games across two spells at Dean Court span­ning more than a decade.</p>
    <p>The English­man was ini­tially ap­pointed as care­taker man­ager in De­cem­ber 2008, and de­fied ex­pec­ta­tions to se­cure the club’s safety in League Two de­spite start­ing the sea­son with a 17-point de­duc­tion.</p>
    <p>He then went on to win pro­mo­tion to third-tier League One the fol­low­ing sea­son. Af­ter a brief spell as Burn­ley man­ager, Howe re­turned, even­tu­ally guid­ing his boy­hood club to the Pre­mier League for the first time in 2015.</p>
    <p>Bournemout­h chief ex­ec­u­tive Neill Blake paid trib­ute to his ac­com­plish­ments, in­sist­ing that their mu­tual part­ing of ways was one of his hard­est de­ci­sions.</p>
    <p>“Ed­die Howe is syn­ony­mous with this foot­ball club, both as a player and a man­ager, and that will never change,” he said. “He is quite sim­ply a Bournemout­h leg­end, hav­ing helped trans­form the iden­tity and his­tory of the club.”</p>
