    <p>LON­DON • Lewis Hamil­ton was named BBC Sports Per­son­al­ity of the Year on Sun­day, round­ing off a re­mark­able year in which he be­came For­mula One world cham­pion for a sev­enth time.</p>
    <p>He beat off com­pe­ti­tion from Liver­pool cap­tain Jor­dan Hen­der­son and fe­male jockey Hol­lie Doyle, who fin­ished sec­ond and third re­spec­tively, to col­lect Bri­tish sport’s premier an­nual award for a sec­ond time af­ter win­ning it in 2014.</p>
    <p>Hamil­ton won his fourth con­sec­u­tive world ti­tle this year to match Michael Schu­macher’s record of seven crowns.</p>
    <p>Heavy­weight box­ing cham­pion Tyson Fury, crick­eter Stuart Broad and snooker great Ron­nie O’Sullivan were also short­listed, so the Mercedes driver was thrilled to get the pub­lic’s vote de­spite all the big names.</p>
    <p>“I want to say con­grat­u­la­tions to all the in­cred­i­ble nom­i­nees,” said Hamil­ton. “I’m so proud of what they have achieved and I want to say thank you to ev­ery­one that has voted for me.</p>
    <p>“I wasn’t ex­pect­ing this know­ing there are so many great con­tenders. There are so many great sto­ries out there and so I truly wasn’t ex­pect­ing it.</p>
    <p>“Your heart’s al­ways pump­ing in those last few sec­onds when they’re an­nounc­ing be­cause you have ab­so­lutely no idea who was called in. But I am so, so, so grate­ful to the Bri­tish pub­lic.</p>
    <p>“This def­i­nitely goes a long way to giv­ing me the best Christ­mas that I can have given the cir­cum­stances.”</p>
    <p>Sep­a­rately, Alexan­der Al­bon gave his first pub­lic state­ment since be­ing dropped by Red Bull in favour of Ser­gio Perez.</p>
    <p>Mex­i­can Perez, who was re­leased by Racing Point de­spite fin­ish­ing fourth over­all in the stand­ings last sea­son, will race along­side Max Ver­stap­pen.</p>
    <p>The Bri­tish-born Thai paid the price for an in­con­sis­tent cam­paign – he ended sev­enth and ac­cord­ing to RaceFans web­site, he was on av­er­age 0.522 sec­onds slower than Ver­stap­pen, which Red Bull deemed not good enough.</p>
    <p>How­ever, Al­bon, who has been de­moted to the role of test and re­serve driver, ad­mit­ted he was de­jected by his ax­ing, say­ing on In­sta­gram: “I can’t lie guys, it hurts.</p>
    <p>“I gave it every­thing out there but it wasn’t quite enough.</p>
    <p>“I want to say a huge thank you to all of you that sup­ported me through­out this year, es­pe­cially my Thai fans.</p>
    <p>“I have more to give and my fo­cus is getting back for 2022 and to wave the Thai flag again.”</p>
    <p>His de­par­ture leaves Ja­panese rookie Yuki Tsun­oda, who is set to de­but for Al­phaTauri when the new sea­son opens in Aus­tralia on March 21, as the only Asian driver on the grid.</p>
    <p>A BIG SUR­PRISE</p>
    <p>I wasn’t ex­pect­ing this know­ing there are so many great con­tenders.</p>
