    <p>How did an on­line con­spir­acy the­ory be­come so strong that it is in­flu­enc­ing the pol­i­tics of the party rul­ing the world’s most pow­er­ful coun­try while in­spir­ing ter­ror­ists at the same time?</p>
    <p>The rise of QAnon – an on­line con­spir­acy the­ory that has the trap­pings of a re­li­gious cult – is re­flec­tive of broader trends in so­ci­ety, no­tably how tech­nol­ogy is blunt­ing our abil­ity to know what is real while driv­ing ex­ist­ing ten­den­cies for pol­i­tics to head into ever more ex­treme di­rec­tions.</p>
    <p>QAnon seems an im­prob­a­ble plat­form for po­lit­i­cal of­fice.</p>
    <p>It claims, among other things, that a pow­er­ful ca­bal of pae­dophiles and can­ni­bals within the “deep state” is en­gaged in a global fight to take down US Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump.</p>
    <p>No one knows who Q is (hence the Anon tag) but his (or her) cryp­tic mes­sages have led to ac­tions that are suf­fi­ciently wor­ry­ing for the Fed­eral Bureau of In­ves­ti­ga­tion (FBI) to flag QAnon as a po­ten­tial do­mes­tic ter­ror threat.</p>
    <p>The move­ment has not merely sur­vived its in­fa­mous early fi­asco (in­volv­ing a gun­man at­tack­ing a Wash­ing­ton pizza out­let in the be­lief that it was a front for a Hil­lary Clinton-run pae­dophile ring) but has thrived.</p>
    <p>QAnon has in­creas­ingly grown in pop­u­lar­ity in Repub­li­can po­lit­i­cal cir­cles, with sev­eral sup­port­ers win­ning re­cent con­gres­sional pri­maries. One of them, Ms Mar­jorie Tay­lor Greene, is likely to land a seat in the House of Rep­re­sen­ta­tives.</p>
    <p>Face­book, In­sta­gram, Twit­ter and Red­dit have shut down nu­mer­ous QAnon ac­counts and com­mu­ni­ties, Repub­li­can politi­cians have voiced mis­giv­ings – Se­na­tor Lind­sey Gra­ham has called it “batsh*t crazy” – but no­tably Mr Trump has seemed to wel­come its sup­port­ers, claim­ing that they “like me very much” and “love Amer­ica”.</p>
    <p>QAnon’s suc­cess comes from a strangely mod­ern brew.</p>
    <p>It lacks a lead­er­ship, be­yond an imag­ined one on­line (in which Mr Trump is an un­know­ing leader and anony­mous in­di­vid­u­als work­ing within the govern­ment are leak­ing in­for­ma­tion to the world), but this al­most com­plete lack of struc­ture helps ex­plain why a se­ries of on­line posts has be­come a move­ment that en­com­passes ev­ery­thing from do­mes­tic ter­ror­ists to peo­ple run­ning for Congress.</p>
    <p>To be sure, open­ness at an ide­o­log­i­cal level is not unique to QAnon. Most move­ments are in­her­ently evan­gel­i­cal.</p>
    <p>If you are ad­vanc­ing a world-trans­form­ing idea, you are usu­ally seek­ing ad­her­ents or fol­low­ers. This re­quires an abil­ity to broad­cast and a method by which peo­ple can join and par­tic­i­pate.</p>
    <p>But the point at which they move from be­com­ing merely a lis­tener to be­ing a more ac­tive mem­ber is the point at which a bar­rier usu­ally needs to ex­ist.</p>
    <p>Here, a com­par­i­son with vi­o­lent Is­lamist groups can of­fer in­sights.</p>
    <p>For groups like the Is­lamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS) or Je­maah Is­lamiah (JI), the ideas can ini­tially be found on­line or at pub­lic gath­er­ings where preach­ers speak or teach. This pro­vides an ini­tial point of con­tact which the in­di­vid­ual can then fol­low up and, if he is as­sid­u­ous enough, even­tu­ally leads to his re­cruit­ment af­ter some “vet­ting”.</p>
    <p>QAnon is dif­fer­ent. Rather than be­ing a struc­tured or­gan­i­sa­tion that has in­di­vid­u­als who con­trol en­try, QAnon pro­vides ac­cess on­line through dis­cus­sion fo­rums such as 4chan and 8chan where ideas and con­spir­acy the­o­ries can be fol­lowed and de­vel­oped.</p>
    <p>More ac­tive ad­her­ents pro­duce doc­u­men­tary films or write long ar­ti­cles which ex­pound and ex­plain links to oth­ers.</p>
    <p>But the fun­da­men­tal ideas are out there for any­one to find.</p>
    <p>And sim­i­lar to those of other such move­ments, they of­fer an an­swer.</p>
    <p>But un­like ide­olo­gies with a core text which re­quires in­ter­pre­ta­tion by trained sub­ject mat­ter ex­perts, here the core text is one that is self-as­sem­bled, draw­ing on the lim­it­less vol­ume of in­for­ma­tion that ex­ists in our on­line world.</p>
    <p>The core ideas of QAnon – that the world is ruled by a dark ca­bal which Mr Trump is fight­ing – are peren­nial, but how you get to them and where you see the links are up to the in­di­vid­ual and his own in­ter­pre­ta­tion.</p>
    <p>The ide­ol­ogy be­comes one that you par­tially as­sem­ble your­self. This gives the ideas greater salience and strength for the in­di­vid­ual, help­ing to ex­plain the ap­peal.</p>
    <p>As Q fol­low­ers say: “Do your own re­search, make up your own mind.”</p>
    <p>The idea that hu­mans need an ex­pla­na­tion for how the world works is not new.</p>
    <p>In dark and con­fus­ing times, peo­ple will reg­u­larly turn to more ex­treme ex­pla­na­tions and strong mes­sen­gers.</p>
    <p>We are liv­ing through a mo­ment of great po­lit­i­cal dis­rup­tion along­side an ex­plo­sion in in­for­ma­tion and dis­in­for­ma­tion. Cer­tain­ties no longer ex­ist.</p>
    <p>Deep­fakes mean that even mov­ing im­ages can be cred­i­bly al­tered. We strug­gle to know what we know and what we do not know.</p>
    <p>The one cer­tainty many peo­ple seem to have is that the world is get­ting worse and en­tropic forces are tak­ing us down to­wards some cat­a­strophic end.</p>
    <p>Mes­sianic or dem­a­gogic lead­er­ship be­comes im­por­tant at a mo­ment like this as it ap­pears to pro­vide clar­ity amid con­fu­sion.</p>
    <p>Prob­lem­at­i­cally, QAnon’s leader is the ether.</p>
    <p>Un­like ISIS, JI or Al-Qaeda in their hey­day with clear hi­er­ar­chies, plans and di­rec­tion which their fol­low­ers were steered to­wards, QAnon of­fers an idea and sense of be­long­ing to an en­tirely lead­er­less or­gan­i­sa­tion.</p>
    <p>This makes the tip­ping point to vi­o­lence much harder to iden­tify, as it is lo­cated within each in­di­vid­ual rather than the or­gan­i­sa­tion it­self.</p>
    <p>QAnon of­fers it­self as an idea that ad­her­ents can build them­selves.</p>
    <p>Some in­di­vid­u­als get so worked up they end up like the Illi­nois wo­man who threat­ened to kill Demo­cratic pres­i­den­tial can­di­date Joe Bi­den over claims of sex traf­fick­ing.</p>
    <p>Oth­ers or­gan­ise, either by run­ning for pub­lic of­fice or tak­ing part in a pro-po­lice protest in Port­land, Ore­gon.</p>
    <p>Many are con­tent am­pli­fy­ing the el­lip­ti­cal mes­sages on­line and, at Trump ral­lies, flash­ing sym­bols and slo­gans.</p>
    <p>Be­ing such a broad-spec­trum, DIY move­ment, QAnon is able to em­brace both the main­stream and the ex­treme.</p>
    <p>It also helps ex­plain why the FBI can iden­tify it as a source of con­cern while nu­mer­ous Repub­li­can party mem­bers can run on cam­paigns that openly ref­er­ence it.</p>
    <p>It is also why it will be im­pos­si­ble to erad­i­cate. Scat­tered on­line, it is un­likely to go away un­til some­thing else comes along and re­places it.</p>
    <p>Hu­mankind is al­ways seek­ing lead­er­ship and ex­pla­na­tion, and QAnon of­fers both in an al­most lim­it­less, crowd­sourced and rein­ter­pretable form.</p>
    <p>It pro­vides a haven for those an­gry at the world who can in­ter­pret it as a ra­tio­nale for go­ing to­wards vi­o­lence, while it also cre­ates a large enough com­mu­nity that is at­trac­tive to politi­cians seek­ing sup­port­ers.</p>
    <p>QAnon is a cult for our trou­bled times, bring­ing re­li­gion, ex­pla­na­tion, lead­er­ship and iden­tity to its fol­low­ers at the same time.</p>
