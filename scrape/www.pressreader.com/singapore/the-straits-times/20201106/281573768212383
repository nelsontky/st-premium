    <p>Uni­ver­si­ties in Sin­ga­pore need to be more trans­par­ent about sex­ual mis­con­duct. They should be proac­tive, not re­ac­tive, with data, and be more timely and sen­si­tive to the needs of the vic­tims, says ed­u­ca­tion cor­re­spon­dent Amelia Teng.</p>
    <p>The re­cent case of the Na­tional Univer­sity of Sin­ga­pore (NUS) fir­ing one of its staff for al­leged sex­ual mis­con­duct high­lights the need for in­sti­tu­tions to take the lead in the na­tional con­ver­sa­tion about this mat­ter.</p>
    <p>On Tues­day, in re­sponse to MPs’ queries in Par­lia­ment, Ms Sun Xuel­ing, Min­is­ter of State for Ed­u­ca­tion, re­vealed that in­sti­tutes of higher learn­ing – in­clud­ing poly­tech­nics and the In­sti­tute of Tech­ni­cal Ed­u­ca­tion – han­dled 172 cases of sex­ual mis­con­duct by stu­dents and staff in the past five aca­demic years.</p>
    <p>The last time such in­for­ma­tion was dis­closed was also in Par­lia­ment, when then Ed­u­ca­tion Min­is­ter Ong Ye Kung said last year that the six au­ton­o­mous uni­ver­si­ties han­dled 56 dis­ci­plinary cases in­volv­ing sex­ual mis­con­duct by their stu­dents.</p>
    <p>Pro­vid­ing such data is nec­es­sary and good, but it does not go far enough to tackle the prob­lem.</p>
    <p>Sex­ual mis­con­duct on cam­puses has been in the pub­lic spot­light in re­cent years, with vic­tims com­ing for­ward to tell their sto­ries.</p>
    <p>The is­sue resur­faced last year when former NUS stu­dent Mon­ica Baey – who was filmed in the shower in a res­i­dence hall by a male stu­dent – sparked a na­tional con­ver­sa­tion about how uni­ver­si­ties han­dle such cases.</p>
    <p>This year, NUS has once again come un­der fire for its han­dling of sex­ual mis­con­duct ac­cu­sa­tions, and how it was nei­ther trans­par­ent nor timely in in­form­ing stu­dents of its ac­tions.</p>
    <p>On Oct 7, the univer­sity fired Dr Jeremy Fer­nando, who was teach­ing at Tem­busu Col­lege, af­ter al­le­ga­tions of sex­ual mis­con­duct made against him by two fe­male stu­dents sur­faced in Au­gust and Septem­ber.</p>
    <p>BE OPEN</p>
    <p>Up till now, most in­for­ma­tion – from dis­ci­plinary mech­a­nisms to staff codes of con­duct – is typ­i­cally shared only when there is a pub­lic out­cry, or in re­sponse to stu­dents’ re­quests.</p>
    <p>In­stead of be­ing re­ac­tive and just pro­vid­ing state­ments in times of crises, uni­ver­si­ties must be proac­tive and take the lead.</p>
    <p>The first step is to pro­vide cru­cial in­for­ma­tion that is of pub­lic in­ter­est. The Min­istry of</p>
    <p>Ed­u­ca­tion (MOE) has given some data on how many sex­ual mis­con­duct cases higher learn­ing in­sti­tu­tions see, in re­sponse to par­lia­men­tary ques­tions.</p>
    <p>But in­sti­tu­tions here do not pro­vide such fig­ures on their own reg­u­larly, and not much is known about the types of sex­ual of­fences com­mit­ted.</p>
    <p>It would also be ben­e­fi­cial to know what units re­cently set up by the uni­ver­si­ties, to help stu­dents af­fected by sex­ual mis­con­duct, have done so far.</p>
    <p>Are stu­dents will­ing to ap­proach the NUS Vic­tim Care Unit for help, does it have enough man­power and how many cases has it seen? What were the re­sults of a cam­pus-wide sur­vey on safety done this year?</p>
    <p>In re­sponse to queries from The Straits Times, an NUS spokesman said its Vic­tim Care Unit, which was set up in Au­gust last year, cur­rently has enough staff to man­age the cases it re­ceives, but it also re­views staffing needs to en­sure that stu­dents get enough sup­port.</p>
    <p>It now has eight staff: four care of­fi­cers to pro­vide di­rect care and sup­port to vic­tims, and four staff to run the daily op­er­a­tions and outreach pro­grammes.</p>
    <p>But there is no con­text for the pub­lic to know if these num­bers are in fact ad­e­quate, as the spokesman was un­able to share fur­ther in­for­ma­tion on how many cases it has seen.</p>
    <p>He cited the need to pro­tect stu­dents’ pri­vacy and re­duce the bar­ri­ers pre­vent­ing oth­ers from com­ing for­ward to seek help.</p>
    <p>A sim­i­lar unit at the Sin­ga­pore Man­age­ment Univer­sity also could not pro­vide any num­bers, with a univer­sity spokesman cit­ing the need to main­tain the con­fi­den­tial­ity of re­port­ing par­ties.</p>
    <p>It is quite a dif­fer­ent pic­ture at some over­seas uni­ver­si­ties, which are also grap­pling with sex­ual of­fences and crit­i­cism from stu­dents for cov­er­ing up in­ci­dents.</p>
    <p>In the spirit of be­ing trans­par­ent, some Amer­i­can uni­ver­si­ties have in re­cent years reg­u­larly pub­lished data on sex­ual mis­con­duct and as­sault, in the hope that in­for­ma­tion will also raise aware­ness of the sever­ity of such of­fences.</p>
    <p>Brown Univer­sity re­leases a yearly re­port on the cases in­volv­ing mem­bers of its com­mu­nity – how many com­plaints it re­ceives, what cat­e­gories they fall un­der, how they were re­solved and what the out­comes were.</p>
    <p>Yale Univer­sity also pub­lishes an an­nual re­port on sex­ual mis­con­duct com­plaints brought to its at­ten­tion, and the ac­tions taken by the univer­sity to ad­dress these.</p>
    <p>It also in­cludes up­dates on cases in pre­vi­ous years, and breaks down the num­ber of com­plainants who chose to make po­lice re­ports.</p>
    <p>None of these ef­forts in­fringes on any per­son’s pri­vacy – no one is ask­ing for the de­tails of in­di­vid­ual cases and the names of vic­tims and per­pe­tra­tors.</p>
    <p>But these re­ports un­cover im­por­tant de­tails in the fight against sex­ual mis­con­duct, so that we know whether uni­ver­si­ties’ re­port­ing pro­cesses and sys­tems are ef­fec­tive, and if stu­dents are will­ing and know where to seek help.</p>
    <p>In fact, know­ing that there are fel­low stu­dents who are step­ping for­ward to ask for help can also en­cour­age more to do the same.</p>
    <p>BE TIMELY</p>
    <p>There has been some progress in the past year since last year’s up­roar, in that uni­ver­si­ties have shared more in­for­ma­tion about sex­ual ha­rass­ment pub­licly and made known their dis­ci­plinary frame­works for such of­fences.</p>
    <p>But the lat­est in­ci­dent has shown that time­li­ness in giv­ing up­dates is still miss­ing when it comes to in­di­vid­ual cases.</p>
    <p>Stu­dents ques­tioned why there was a con­sid­er­able gap be­tween the time the com­plaints against Dr Fer­nando were made and when the univer­sity no­ti­fied them of his dis­missal, on Oct 18.</p>
    <p>NUS has ac­knowl­edged its mis­take in not in­form­ing stu­dents ear­lier, and has since pledged to be more trans­par­ent about sex­ual mis­con­duct cases. It also re­leased a time­line of its ac­tions.</p>
    <p>There is a place for con­fi­den­tial­ity, and en­sur­ing that vic­tims are kept safe. But pro­tect­ing vic­tims’ pri­vacy is not the same as stay­ing silent, or giv­ing the min­i­mal re­sponse, on a sub­ject that is of grave con­cern to many.</p>
    <p>Stu­dents should not have to hear from so­cial me­dia or else­where what is happening on their own cam­puses. Nei­ther should they have to take to In­sta­gram or any other plat­form to voice their un­hap­pi­ness about any in­ac­tion.</p>
    <p>As­so­ci­a­tion of Women for</p>
    <p>Ac­tion and Re­search ex­ec­u­tive di­rec­tor Corinna Lim told The Straits Times: “Where the or­gan­i­sa­tion de­cides to share in­for­ma­tion with the com­mu­nity, it should do so on a timely ba­sis.</p>
    <p>“It should also ex­plain the ra­tio­nale be­hind ac­tions, cit­ing rel­e­vant poli­cies, demon­strat­ing a nu­anced un­der­stand­ing of the dy­nam­ics of sex­ual vi­o­lence, and lis­ten­ing at­ten­tively to all feed­back.”</p>
    <p>BE SEN­SI­TIVE</p>
    <p>Be­sides be­ing forth­com­ing, uni­ver­si­ties must also be sen­si­tive in the way they deal with vic­tims.</p>
    <p>The two fe­male stu­dents in the lat­est case ear­lier told The Straits Times they were un­happy that NUS had in­formed them about a po­lice re­port only af­ter it was made.</p>
    <p>Both said this move went against their wishes not to go to the po­lice.</p>
    <p>A spokesman for NUS clar­i­fied on Wed­nes­day that it had reached out to the vic­tims to in­form them about its le­gal duty to make a po­lice re­port, and not when it was go­ing to file the re­port.</p>
    <p>It man­aged to in­form one of the stu­dents of this obli­ga­tion, even if she opted not to do the same.</p>
    <p>Un­der Sec­tion 424 of the Crim­i­nal Pro­ce­dure Code, any­one aware of the “com­mis­sion or the in­ten­tion of an­other per­son to com­mit any ar­restable of­fence shall, in the ab­sence of rea­son­able ex­cuse”, im­me­di­ately pro­vide the au­thor­i­ties with in­for­ma­tion.</p>
    <p>Lawyers have said this le­gal duty is de­bat­able, given that a vic­tim’s choice, among other fac­tors, could be deemed “rea­son­able ex­cuses”.</p>
    <p>This grey area aside, if the univer­sity has de­cided that it must abide by this clause, more care and sen­si­tiv­ity is needed when han­dling vic­tims of sex­ual mis­con­duct and es­pe­cially when rop­ing them into po­lice in­ves­ti­ga­tions against their wishes.</p>
    <p>Any in­ter­ac­tions with vic­tims must be han­dled bet­ter and with more care, as far as pos­si­ble.</p>
    <p>Pro­to­cols – le­gal and all other as­pects – must be sen­si­tively and promptly com­mu­ni­cated to them, so that it does not seem that the in­sti­tu­tion is mak­ing it up as it goes along, or that vic­tims are be­ing kept in the dark.</p>
    <p>BUILD TRUST</p>
    <p>To tackle sex­ual mis­con­duct, uni­ver­si­ties must be proac­tive and delve deeper into the prob­lem – to un­der­stand why and how these cases arise, so that it can find the cor­rect so­lu­tions.</p>
    <p>Be­ing open and hon­est also builds trust with the larger stu­dent body and raises pub­lic con­fi­dence in the uni­ver­si­ties’ sys­tems.</p>
    <p>It also sends a mes­sage that uni­ver­si­ties take feed­back se­ri­ously and any al­le­ga­tions will be thor­oughly in­ves­ti­gated.</p>
    <p>Uni­ver­si­ties abroad re­lease data from large-scale sur­veys on sex­ual mis­con­duct as part of ef­forts to un­der­stand what more can be done to pre­vent such of­fences.</p>
    <p>This must be a com­mit­ment that Sin­ga­pore’s uni­ver­si­ties make as well, in­stead of shy­ing away from re­quests for such in­for­ma­tion.</p>
    <p>They have an obli­ga­tion to stu­dents and their par­ents to make sure cam­puses are safe spa­ces to learn, and to re­as­sure them that the right struc­tures are in place.</p>
    <p>There is no sil­ver bul­let in pre­vent­ing sex­ual mis­con­duct, but be­ing forth­com­ing is the first step to im­prov­ing trust in the pro­cesses, and uni­ver­si­ties must take up this chal­lenge.</p>
    <p>Pro­tect­ing vic­tims’ pri­vacy is not the same as stay­ing silent, or giv­ing the min­i­mal re­sponse, on a sub­ject that is of grave con­cern to many. Stu­dents should not have to hear from so­cial me­dia or else­where what is happening on their own cam­puses. Nei­ther should they have to take to In­sta­gram or any other plat­form to voice their un­hap­pi­ness about any in­ac­tion.</p>
