    <p>Five food and bev­er­age (F&B) out­lets have been or­dered to close, while 16 other out­lets and 36 in­di­vid­u­als will be fined for breach­ing safe man­age­ment mea­sures.</p>
    <p>The breaches were un­cov­ered dur­ing stepped-up en­force­ment checks over the last week­end, the Min­istry of Sus­tain­abil­ity and the En­vi­ron­ment (MSE) said in a state­ment yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The stepped-up sur­veil­lance will ex­tend over the next few weeks, co­in­cid­ing with the end-of-year festive pe­riod.</p>
    <p>The state­ment yes­ter­day said that on Dec 18, the Ur­ban Re­de­vel­op­ment Au­thor­ity (URA) is­sued an or­der re­quir­ing the Cheers Up out­let at 2 Have­lock Road to close for 10 days from last Satur­day to Dec 28 for al­low­ing pa­trons to con­sume al­co­holic bev­er­ages past 10.30pm on Dec 11.</p>
    <p>When of­fi­cers did a fol­low-up check on Dec 18, they found the out­let was still al­low­ing pa­trons to con­sume al­co­holic bev­er­ages at 11.15pm. URA is­sued an­other clo­sure or­der for 20 days from Dec 29 to Jan 17 next year.</p>
    <p>Four other es­tab­lish­ments also com­mit­ted of­fences last Satur­day.</p>
    <p>Among them, One Min Club in Or­chard com­mit­ted mul­ti­ple breaches of safe man­age­ment mea­sures. These in­cluded al­low­ing a group of seven peo­ple to be seated to­gether at a ta­ble, a group of 11 peo­ple to be seated at an­other ta­ble, and pro­vid­ing drink­ing games to pa­trons.</p>
    <p>F&B es­tab­lish­ments are not al­lowed to pro­vide games if they are not also an amuse­ment cen­tre. The Sin­ga­pore Tourism Board (STB)</p>
    <p>has is­sued an or­der re­quir­ing the op­er­a­tor to close its premises for 10 days from Dec 20.</p>
    <p>Ad­di­tion­ally, en­force­ment of­fi­cers also ob­served pa­trons at Tang­men in Or­chard con­sum­ing al­co­holic bev­er­ages which were con­cealed i n green tea bot­tles at 3.40am. STB has is­sued an or­der re­quir­ing the op­er­a­tor to close its premises for 10 days till Dec 28.</p>
    <p>At Chong Qing Steam­boat i n Beach Road, a group of eight pa­trons were found in­ter­min­gling at 10pm last Satur­day. URA has or­dered the op­er­a­tor to close for 10 days till Jan 1.</p>
    <p>Fi­nally, last Satur­day, of­fi­cers ob­served pa­trons at QQ in South Bridge Road con­sum­ing al­co­holic bev­er­ages at 10.40pm. URA or­dered the op­er­a­tor to close for 10 days till Jan 1.</p>
    <p>The 16 F&B out­lets that will be fined com­mit­ted of­fences such as ad­mit­ting and seat­ing groups of more than five to­gether, al­low­ing groups to in­ter­min­gle, and seat­ing groups of pa­trons less than 1m apart, said the min­istry.</p>
    <p>A to­tal of 36 in­di­vid­u­als will also be fined for not ob­serv­ing safe man­age­ment mea­sures at F&B out­lets. They had gath­ered and sat in groups of more than five and in­ter­min­gled between groups, the min­istry said.</p>
    <p>“Agen­cies are re­view­ing the breaches and the ap­pro­pri­ate en­force­ment ac­tions to be taken, in­clud­ing tem­po­rary clo­sure of the out­lets and the is­suance of fines.</p>
    <p>F&B out­lets with re­peated of­fences will face harsher penal­ties,” MSE said.</p>
    <p>Un­der the cur­rent phase two Covid-19 reg­u­la­tions, so­cial gath­er­ings in groups of more than five out­side an in­di­vid­ual’s res­i­dence are not al­lowed.</p>
    <p>F&B out­lets are not al­lowed to ac­cept book­ings from groups that are larger than five, even if such groups are split across mul­ti­ple ta­bles.</p>
    <p>In­ter­min­gling between groups is also pro­hib­ited.</p>
    <p>“The Gov­ern­ment will not hes­i­tate to take strong en­force­ment ac­tion against op­er­a­tors and in­di­vid­u­als who treat safe man­age­ment mea­sures with fla­grant dis­re­gard,” MSE warned.</p>
