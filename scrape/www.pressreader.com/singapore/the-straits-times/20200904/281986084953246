    <p>A three-month-old baby died af­ter his mother found him un­con­scious on a bed in Fe­bru­ary 2018. He had shared the same bed as her.</p>
    <p>The state coro­ner yes­ter­day recorded an open ver­dict in the case, say­ing that the cause of death was in­con­clu­sive and there was no ba­sis to sus­pect foul play.</p>
    <p>The child, who had been a sickly baby, could have died af­ter his mother ac­ci­den­tally rolled on top of him while she was sleep­ing.</p>
    <p>There was also a pos­si­bil­ity that the in­fant, who was born pre­ma­ture, could have died from an ill­ness, or from as­phyxia from be­ing in a prone sleep­ing po­si­tion.</p>
    <p>Two months af­ter this tragedy, the mother killed her daugh­ter by throw­ing the two-year-old girl to the floor twice in a fit of anger.</p>
    <p>In Novem­ber last year, she was sen­tenced to seven years in jail af­ter plead­ing guilty to a charge of cul­pa­ble homi­cide not amount­ing to mur­der.</p>
    <p>The mother of six, now 31, was found to be suf­fer­ing from a ma­jor de­pres­sive dis­or­der at the time of the at­tack.</p>
    <p>Sep­a­rately, in 2011, her older son died of a vi­ral in­fec­tion when he was four months old.</p>
    <p>The woman and her fam­ily mem­bers can­not be named due to a gag or­der.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing the in­quiry, the court heard that on Jan 22, 2018, her younger son was ad­mit­ted to KK Women’s and Chil­dren’s Hospi­tal and di­ag­nosed with gas­troen­teri­tis af­ter a 10-day bout of di­ar­rhoea, four days of vom­it­ing and three days of fever. He was dis­charged six days later, af­ter treat­ment.</p>
    <p>On Feb 6 that year, the baby was sleep­ing at home at around 11am when his mother de­cided to take a nap be­side him on the same bed.</p>
    <p>When the baby started cry­ing, she placed him face down with his head turned to one side.</p>
    <p>She also used a bol­ster to sup­port his body, said State Coro­ner Ka­mala Pon­nam­palam yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The woman fell asleep be­side her son soon af­ter.</p>
    <p>She woke up about three hours later and found the in­fant ly­ing face down against a pil­low. He had turned blue.</p>
    <p>She called for an am­bu­lance and an op­er­a­tor di­rected her to per­form car­diopul­monary re­sus­ci­ta­tion on the child.</p>
    <p>Paramedics later ar­rived and rushed the boy to Ng Teng Fong Gen­eral Hospi­tal, where he was pro­nounced dead at 4.13pm.</p>
    <p>Two months af­ter this tragedy, the woman killed his older sis­ter.</p>
    <p>The housewife was tend­ing to the lit­tle girl in their two-room flat on April 9, 2018, when she be­came an­gry with the tod­dler for defe­cat­ing on a towel in the bed­room af­ter her bath. Shortly af­ter, the woman was fur­ther an­gered when the girl did not obey her in­struc­tions to go to the bed­room.</p>
    <p>She pulled the tod­dler into a room, lifted her up to shoul­der level and threw her to the floor force­fully. This made the girl cry even louder. The woman then told her daugh­ter to clean up her toys in the liv­ing room.</p>
    <p>When she saw the girl stand­ing still and cry­ing, she lifted her up again and threw her to the floor. The lit­tle girl died soon af­ter.</p>
