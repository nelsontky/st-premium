    <p>Al­most 10 years after it was mooted, the world’s largest trade pact – the Re­gional Com­pre­hen­sive Eco­nomic Part­ner­ship (RCEP) – was signed at the week­end. In­volv­ing the 10 mem­bers of Asean, plus Aus­tralia, China, Ja­pan, South Korea and New Zealand, the RCEP cov­ers nearly onethird of the world’s pop­u­la­tion and con­trib­utes al­most 30 per cent of its gross do­mes­tic prod­uct. Ne­go­ti­a­tions be­gan in earnest in 2012 but hit sev­eral speed bumps along the way, the largest one be­ing In­dia’s with­drawal from talks in November last year after cit­ing con­cerns that it would be swamped by cheap im­ports. Al­though other coun­tries will not be al­lowed to join the RCEP for a cer­tain pe­riod of time after it takes ef­fect, the door re­mains open for In­dia to par­tic­i­pate again.</p>
    <p>The eco­nomic fall­out glob­ally from t he Covid-19 pandemic was a sig­nif­i­cant mo­ti­vat­ing fac­tor in fi­nal­is­ing the deal, given the ben­e­fits of its cuts to tar­iffs and trade bar­ri­ers. The RCEP will im­prove mar­ket ac­cess for goods and ser­vices, at­tract­ing for­eign com­pa­nies keen on en­ter­ing a more in­te­grated Asean mar­ket. It aims to es­tab­lish a com­mon set of rules to fa­cil­i­tate trade among par­tic­i­pat­ing coun­tries, some­thing which is im­por­tant for deep­en­ing transna­tional sup­ply chains, and it also cov­ers non-tra­di­tional ar­eas which are not in some ex­ist­ing agree­ments such as e-com­merce and in­tel­lec­tual prop­erty.</p>
    <p>China has pushed hard­est for the deal, which will help it to se­cure tar­iff-free im­ports from RCEP part­ners amid the on­go­ing trade war with the United States. But there are lin­ger­ing con­cerns about a pact which ap­pears dom­i­nated by China. The Trans-Pa­cific Part­ner­ship (TPP) agree­ment, which the US pulled out of in 2017, was seen as a coun­ter­weight to the RCEP, and the RCEP was sup­posed to in­clude In­dia to bal­ance out China. Nei­ther sce­nario has panned out the way it was en­vis­aged. As for the Com­pre­hen­sive and Pro­gres­sive Agree­ment for Trans-Pa­cific Part­ner­ship – which evolved from the TPP and which China is not part of – few are hold­ing their breath that the US, which is still emerg­ing from the throes of a bit­terly con­tested elec­tion, will re­turn to the ta­ble any time soon.</p>
    <p>Re­la­tions be­tween two RCEP par­ties hit a snag in April after Aus­tralia led calls for an in­de­pen­dent probe into the ori­gins of the coro­n­avirus. The Chi­nese gov­ern­ment has hit back by re­strict­ing im­ports of Aus­tralian beef, bar­ley and wine. There is a risk that the RCEP would be stymied by the lat­est spat. On the other hand, the ad­van­tage of such a re­gional pact is that it en­cour­ages di­a­logue to build trust and co­op­er­a­tion. It also con­strains the be­hav­iour of coun­tries within a rules-based frame­work, mak­ing uni­lat­eral ac­tion harder. The road to RCEP has been a long one, even if there are kinks still to be ironed out.</p>
