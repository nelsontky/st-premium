    <p>WASH­ING­TON • Chi­nese tech­nol­ogy firm ByteDance has agreed to di­vest the US op­er­a­tions of TikTok com­pletely in a bid to save a deal with the White House, after US Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump on Fri­day said he had de­cided to ban the pop­u­lar short-video app, two peo­ple fa­mil­iar with the mat­ter said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>US of­fi­cials have said TikTok, un­der its Chi­nese par­ent, poses a na­tional risk be­cause of the personal data it han­dles.</p>
    <p>ByteDance’s con­ces­sion will test whether Mr Trump’s threat to ban TikTok is a ne­go­ti­at­ing tac­tic or whether he is in­tent on crack­ing down on a so­cial me­dia app that has up to 80 mil­lion daily ac­tive users in the US.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump told re­porters on board Air Force One on Fri­day that he would is­sue an or­der for TikTok to be banned in the US as early as yes­ter­day. “Not the deal that you have been hear­ing about, that they are going to buy and sell... We are not an M&A (merg­ers and ac­qui­si­tions) country,” he said.</p>
    <p>ByteDance was pre­vi­ously seek­ing to keep a mi­nor­ity stake in the US busi­ness of TikTok, which the White House re­jected.</p>
    <p>Un­der the new pro­posed deal, ByteDance would exit com­pletely and Mi­crosoft would take over TikTok in the US, the sources said.</p>
    <p>Some ByteDance in­vestors that are based in the US may be given the op­por­tu­nity to take mi­nor­ity stakes in the busi­ness, the sources added. About 70 per cent of ByteDance’s out­side in­vestors come from the US.</p>
    <p>The White House de­clined to com­ment on whether Mr Trump would ac­cept ByteDance’s con­ces­sion. ByteDance in Bei­jing did not re­spond to a re­quest for com­ment.</p>
    <p>Un­der ByteDance’s new pro­posal, Mi­crosoft will be in charge of pro­tect­ing all US user data, the sources said.</p>
    <p>The plan al­lows for another US com­pany other than Mi­crosoft to take over TikTok in the US, the sources added.</p>
    <p>Mi­crosoft did not re­spond to a re­quest for com­ment.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump’s threat to ban TikTok came after a re­view by the Com­mit­tee on For­eign In­vest­ment in the US (CFIUS), which in­ves­ti­gates deals af­fect­ing US na­tional se­cu­rity.</p>
    <p>TikTok last week pledged a high level of trans­parency, in­clud­ing al­low­ing re­views of its al­go­rithms, to as­sure users and reg­u­la­tors.</p>
    <p>“We are not po­lit­i­cal, we do not ac­cept po­lit­i­cal ad­ver­tis­ing and have no agenda – our only ob­jec­tive is to re­main a vi­brant, dy­namic plat­form for ev­ery­one to en­joy,” TikTok chief ex­ec­u­tive Kevin Mayer said last week.</p>
    <p>“TikTok has be­come the lat­est tar­get, but we are not the en­emy.”</p>
    <p>Ear­lier last month, US Sec­re­tary of State Mike Pom­peo told Fox News that the gov­ern­ment was “look­ing at” ban­ning the app in the US.</p>
    <p>The com­ments prompted pop­u­lar TikTok­ers to con­sider mi­grat­ing to plat­forms such as YouTube, The New York Times re­ported.</p>
    <p>Late on Fri­day, TikTok users re­acted fu­ri­ously to the news, telling their fans to fol­low them on dif­fer­ent plat­forms and crit­i­cis­ing the US Pres­i­dent.</p>
    <p>The pop­u­lar­ity of the plat­form surged after ByteDance ac­quired US-based app Mu­si­cal.ly in 2017 and merged it with its own video ser­vice.</p>
    <p>Dr James Lewis, head of the tech­nol­ogy pol­icy pro­gramme at the Centre for Strate­gic and In­ter­na­tional Stud­ies, said he be­lieves that the se­cu­rity risk of us­ing TikTok is “close to zero”, but that ByteDance could face pres­sure from China to en­gage in cen­sor­ship.</p>
    <p>He said the US au­thor­i­ties un­der CFIUS have the power to un­wind an ac­qui­si­tion pre­vi­ously ap­proved and that a sim­i­lar ac­tion was taken last year with dat­ing app Grindr after it was bought by a Chi­nese firm.</p>
    <p>In­dia has al­ready barred TikTok over na­tional se­cu­rity and privacy con­cerns, while other coun­tries are re­port­edly mulling over sim­i­lar mea­sures.</p>
    <p>Un­der the new pro­posed deal, ByteDance would exit com­pletely and Mi­crosoft would take over TikTok in the US, the sources said. Some ByteDance in­vestors that are based in the US may be given the op­por­tu­nity to take mi­nor­ity stakes in the busi­ness, the sources added. About 70 per cent of ByteDance’s out­side in­vestors come from the US.</p>
