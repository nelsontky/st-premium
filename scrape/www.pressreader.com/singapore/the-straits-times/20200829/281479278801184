    <p>Out i n the open sea, half-sub­merged on a swel­ter­ing day, the fin­ish line nowhere in sight, tired­ness com­ing in waves, com­peti­tors clat­ter­ing into her, the cur­rent tug­ging her in the wrong di­rec­tion, there’s no coach, no physio, no par­ent to help open-wa­ter swim­mer Chan­tal Liew.</p>
    <p>Out there, on this un­du­lat­ing sheet of wa­ter, she’s alone. Ten kilo­me­tres to go and only one ally.</p>
    <p>Her re­solve.</p>
    <p>The on­line Ox­ford dic­tionary ex­plains re­solve as “the firm de­ter­mi­na­tion to do some­thing”. It’s what wakes ath­letes like Liew at dawn and leads them to a cold, daily bap­tism. It’s the voice that nudges them past pain and pushes them to do 10 more laps. Fa­tigue will come, per­sis­tence must meet it.</p>
    <p>But re­solve isn’t a gift handed out by a gen­er­ous God, it has to be built, stoked, re­plen­ished. It’s not a switch you ca­su­ally flick, but a habit you hone. It’s not a trait writ­ten into your DNA, it’s a virtue you sus­tain. It’s not a some-day thing, it’s an every-day com­mit­ment to a goal. And Liew, with the raw beau­ti­ful can­dour of ath­letes, will tell you it’s the tough­est part of sport for her.</p>
    <p>“You con­stantly ques­tion your­self,” she says. “Why did I choose some­thing so dif­fi­cult?” At the pool where she mostly prac­tises, every­one else swims 5-6km and then they’ve gone to change and chat, but she’s still there, no one to pace her, no one to whine to af­ter a hard day, just a soli­tary fig­ure cut­ting the wa­ters. Eight kilo­me­tres. Nine. Ten. The body hurts but the Olympics are call­ing and so she per­sists. No cam­era cap­tures this, but this is grit.</p>
    <p>Her race isn’t 200 lengths of a 50m pool with clean wa­ter and tidy lanes. Her 10km slog is a free-for-all amid na­ture. Some days she comes out of the wa­ter near Changi smelling of oil, her body hav­ing col­lided with jel­ly­fish. “I’m al­ler­gic,” she says “so a cou­ple of hours af­ter the stings I break out in hives.”</p>
    <p>The first time that she – sil­ver medal­list at the 2017 SEA Games – raced the 10km, she says, “af­ter just 200m I got stung by jel­ly­fish and I told my­self, ‘I can stop, no one will think less of me’. But re­solve is im­por­tant and I told my­self I have to do it. And af­ter I de­cide to do some­thing I go through with it.”</p>
    <p>Liew is on her own, per­sonal quest and this can be a mys­tery to av­er­age folk. The great moun­taineer Ge­orge Mal­lory, tired of ex­plain­ing why he wished to climb Ever­est, once replied: “Be­cause it’s there.” The Olympics – as an idea, a dream, a test – puz­zle some out­siders, for they don’t ap­pre­ci­ate the size of the mis­sion and can’t grasp the value of a pur­suit which will prob­a­bly end with­out a medal or money.</p>
    <p>In­stead of urg­ing ath­letes on, peo­ple of­ten di­min­ish them by dis­put­ing their choices. Do you know you are get­ting left be­hind? Shouldn’t you be study­ing? Why aren’t you look­ing for a job? Th­ese ques­tions buf­fet an ath­lete’s faith, but then they get be­hind their dreams and push. Ad­ver­sity is noth­ing but the tough fa­ther of dogged­ness.</p>
    <p>“Peo­ple don’t al­ways un­der­stand,” says Liew. “One time, over lunch, a friend looked at my timetable and said, ‘what are you do­ing with your life. You’re not do­ing enough classes.’ I said, ‘I am train­ing for the Olympics, dude’.” He still did not un­der­stand.</p>
    <p>But it’s not just the ab­sent faith of oth­ers which stings, doubt is also trig­gered from within. Many ath­letes like Liew are over­thinkers, who in­vari­ably won­der if they’re good enough. Every week she’ll ask her coach Mar­cus Cheah, “Can I do it?” Every week he tells her, “Yes. If you stop ques­tion­ing your­self.”</p>
    <p>She feels her pri­mary ri­val for an Olympic spot from Asia – Ja­pan and China are al­ready in – may be Hong Kong’s Nip Tsz Yin and the last time they met, in Septem­ber 2019, Liew lost by 400m. She’s made “huge im­prove­ments” since but still voices crowd her head. Hes­i­tant voices which of­fer a fas­ci­nat­ing peek into the ath­lete’s mind.</p>
    <p>“Am I do­ing enough? Am I putting in enough mileage? Am I putting in enough gym work? What is she do­ing every day? What will it be like to race her? Will the choices I make be cor­rect? Should I swim be­hind her?”</p>
    <p>Liew pauses.</p>
    <p>“I al­ways ques­tion my re­solve.” But th­ese ques­tions, in a way, are a provo­ca­tion to her­self, a chal­lenge she must rise to, and so she digs deeper, she searches harder. There’s a tough­ness which you can see on her face as she poses by the sea. De­ter­mined is a beau­ti­ful look.</p>
    <p>Th­ese ques­tions any­way haunt Liew only on land, for once she dives in the wa­ter washes off her inse­cu­rity. “I have laser-sharp fo­cus then,” she says. “I am good at train­ing. My goals are clear.”</p>
    <p>And so she goes on, past lone­li­ness and doubt and through oil and jel­ly­fish. The Games are too many kilo­me­tres, and so much strug­gle, away, but she’ll find the re­solve. It’s about every day and every stroke. Just dip­ping an arm into the sea and pulling her­self to­wards her fu­ture.</p>
    <p>You con­stantly ques­tion your­self, ‘Why did I choose some­thing so dif­fi­cult?’</p>
    <p>CHAN­TAL LIEW, open-wa­ter swim­mer, on</p>
    <p>her doubts.</p>
