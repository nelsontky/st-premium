    <p>Asean coun­tries and their key part­ners should deepen eco­nomic co­op­er­a­tion and main­tain con­nec­tiv­ity to re­bound from the Covid-19 pan­demic, said Prime Min­is­ter Lee Hsien Loong yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>He added that the con­clu­sion of the Re­gional Com­pre­hen­sive Eco­nomic Part­ner­ship (RCEP) trade deal – ex­pected to be signed on Sun­day – will re­flect the com­mit­ment to “up­hold a rules-based mul­ti­lat­eral trad­ing sys­tem and pro­mote re­gional eco­nomic in­te­gra­tion”.</p>
    <p>PM Lee and fel­low Asean lead­ers at­tended four sum­mits with key part­ners via video­con­fer­ence as part of the 37th Asean Sum­mit hosted by Asean chair Viet­nam.</p>
    <p>The Asean lead­ers met Chi­nese Pre­mier Li Ke­qiang, Ja­panese Prime Min­is­ter Yoshi­hide Suga, South Korean Pres­i­dent Moon Jaein and In­dian Prime Min­is­ter Naren­dra Modi.</p>
    <p>At the Asean-China sum­mit, PM Lee said part­ners like China have been stead­fast in help­ing Asean fight Covid-19, even be­fore the full scale of the pan­demic was known.</p>
    <p>“(We) worked to­gether to main­tain sup­ply chains – and this has sup­ported the re­gion’s ef­forts to con­tain the pan­demic and for­tify the re­silience of our economies – as well as to repa­tri­ate our cit­i­zens and en­sure the health and well­be­ing of our pop­u­la­tions,” he said.</p>
    <p>As na­tions look to­wards the next stage of re­cov­ery, PM Lee said they must work to­gether in the area of vac­cine mul­ti­lat­er­al­ism to en­sure an eq­ui­table, steady and af­ford­able sup­ply of vac­cines and treat­ment.</p>
    <p>He wel­comed Chi­nese Pres­i­dent Xi Jin­ping’s com­mit­ment to make vac­cines a public good and pri­ori­tise the needs of the re­gion, as well as China’s par­tic­i­pa­tion in the Co­vax Fa­cil­ity, which he said re­flects its close re­la­tion­ship with Asean.</p>
    <p>The fa­cil­ity is a global ini­tia­tive that brings to­gether gov­ern­ments and man­u­fac­tur­ers to en­sure even­tual Covid-19 vac­cines reach those in great­est need.</p>
    <p>PM Lee also wel­comed China’s con­tri­bu­tion to the Covid-19 Asean Re­sponse Fund as well as its move to ear­mark US$5 mil­lion (S$6.7 mil­lion) from the Asean-China Co­op­er­a­tion Fund for a public health co­op­er­a­tion pro­gramme.</p>
    <p>At the Asean-South Korea sum­mit, PM Lee said strength­en­ing eco­nomic co­op­er­a­tion would help in the coun­tries’ re­cov­ery.</p>
    <p>The work to up­date the AseanSouth Korea Free Trade Area will help busi­nesses cope with the pan­demic’s im­pact and cre­ate more growth op­por­tu­ni­ties, he added.</p>
    <p>On en­hanc­ing con­nec­tiv­ity, he high­lighted the need to main­tain open and con­nected sup­ply chains so trade flows – in­clud­ing of es­sen­tial sup­plies such as food and med­i­cal equip­ment – are not im­peded.</p>
    <p>“We should also con­sider how we can pro­gres­sively and safely lift travel re­stric­tions while in­sti­tut­ing suit­able public health and safety pro­to­cols,” he said.</p>
    <p>The Asean-Ja­pan sum­mit, which was Mr Suga’s first, saw the launch of the Asean Cen­tre for Public Health Emer­gency and Emerg­ing Dis­eases – a hub to develop coun­ter­mea­sures against the threat of in­fec­tious dis­eases.</p>
    <p>PM Lee said Ja­pan has also con­trib­uted to Asean’s Covid-19 ini­tia­tives through con­sis­tent en­gage­ment and eco­nomic pacts.</p>
    <p>He also thanked Ja­pan for its role in bring­ing the RCEP to “fruition” and push­ing it for­ward “ev­ery step of the way”.</p>
    <p>The RCEP, which will be the world’s largest trade pact, in­volves 15 coun­tries: Asean’s 10 mem­ber states, as well as China, Ja­pan, South Korea, Aus­tralia and New Zealand. To­gether, they con­trib­ute about one-third of the world’s gross do­mes­tic prod­uct.</p>
    <p>Ne­go­ti­a­tions in­volv­ing 16 coun­tries were launched in 2012, but In­dia with­drew from the deal last year, cit­ing con­cerns that the elim­i­na­tion of tar­iffs would open its mar­kets to a flood of im­ports.</p>
    <p>At the Asean-In­dia sum­mit, PM Lee said: “We un­der­stand In­dia’s de­ci­sion not to sign the RCEP at this time. But Sin­ga­pore stands ready to wel­come In­dia to the RCEP, when­ever it is ready to re-join.”</p>
    <p>PM Lee said Covid-19 has em­pha­sised the im­por­tance of Asean strength­en­ing its strate­gic part­ner­ship with In­dia, in­clud­ing in re­search and de­vel­op­ment for vac­cines and treat­ments for the virus.</p>
    <p>In­dia, he noted, is a key player in the global phar­ma­ceu­ti­cal sup­ply chain and has deep tech­no­log­i­cal and biomed­i­cal ex­per­tise.</p>
    <p>PM Lee added: “I hope we can work to­gether to bring new med­i­cal so­lu­tions to the mar­ket quickly, and to fa­cil­i­tate their eq­ui­table, steady and af­ford­able sup­ply.”</p>
    <p>CHINA-ASEAN CO­OP­ER­A­TION</p>
    <p>(We) worked to­gether to main­tain sup­ply chains – and this has sup­ported the re­gion’s ef­forts to con­tain the pan­demic and for­tify the re­silience of our economies – as well as to repa­tri­ate our cit­i­zens and en­sure the health and well-be­ing of our</p>
    <p>’’ pop­u­la­tions.</p>
