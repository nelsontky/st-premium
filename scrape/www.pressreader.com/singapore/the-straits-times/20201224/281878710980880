    <p>•</p>
    <p>MEL­BOURNE Four peo­ple have been charged with un­law­fully light­ing a camp­fire that of­fi­cials said sparked huge blazes on Fraser Is­land off the north-east­ern coast of Aus­tralia in Oc­to­ber, ul­ti­mately raz­ing more than 85,000ha of the pop­u­lar va­ca­tion spot.</p>
    <p>A joint in­ves­ti­ga­tion between the lo­cal po­lice and park rangers found that the men, aged between 21 and 24, had lit an il­le­gal fire at a camp­site on Oct 14.</p>
    <p>The au­thor­i­ties said the fire then spread in a north-west­erly di­rec­tion, rav­aging na­tive veg­e­ta­tion and black­en­ing more than half of the is­land, much of which is a na­tional park known as K’gari that is renowned for its beaches, rain­for­est and im­mense bio­di­ver­sity.</p>
    <p>The con­fla­gra­tion was ul­ti­mately con­trolled ear­lier this month af­ter heavy rain helped fire­fight­ers con­tain the blaze.</p>
    <p>Res­i­dents said they were trau­ma­tised by the smoke and rapid evac­u­a­tions, but no in­juries or deaths were re­ported.</p>
    <p>The lo­cal au­thor­i­ties said that the men were co­op­er­a­tive and felt deeply re­morse­ful. A fifth male, 17, was also present but, as a mi­nor, has not been charged.</p>
    <p>“They’re shocked and dev­as­tated,” Mr David Har­bi­son, a po­lice of­fi­cial at Mary­bor­ough Sta­tion near the is­land, said at a news con­fer­ence on Tues­day.</p>
    <p>“They were care­less, but they never in­tended this to hap­pen,” he added. “They didn’t de­lib­er­ately set fire to the is­land.”</p>
    <p>The blaze was the first sig­nif­i­cant bush fire in Aus­tralia’s an­nual fire sea­son, the fe­roc­ity of which sci­en­tists say is be­com­ing in­creas­ingly dif­fi­cult to pre­dict.</p>
    <p>Last year, bush fires across Aus­tralia’s south-east coast killed 33 peo­ple and more than one bil­lion na­tive an­i­mals, and de­stroyed thou­sands of homes.</p>
    <p>The world’s at­ten­tion was cap­tured by scenes of hol­i­day­mak­ers trapped on beaches, where the morn­ing sky turned pitch black and birds fell dead from the sky.</p>
    <p>At the time, con­ser­va­tive Aus­tralian politi­cians as well as me­dia out­lets pro­mul­gated the myth that ar­son­ists were largely to blame for the fe­roc­ity of the flames. Crit­ics said this was an at­tempt to shift at­ten­tion away from cli­mate change, which they said was the true cul­prit.</p>
    <p>The au­thor­i­ties said light­ning strikes were likely re­spon­si­ble for a ma­jor­ity of the fires dur­ing that sea­son.</p>
    <p>Although the Fraser Is­land fires were sparked by peo­ple, sci­en­tists said it was cru­cial to re­mem­ber that hot­ter and drier con­di­tions are ul­ti­mately to blame for the speed with which the fires spread and the scale of their de­struc­tion.</p>
    <p>“Cli­mate change is mak­ing land­scapes a lot more re­cep­tive to fire be­cause of longer fire sea­sons and drier fuel,” said Dr David Bow­man, a pro­fes­sor of py­ro­geog­ra­phy and fire science at the Univer­sity of Tasmania. “The risk of ac­ci­den­tal fires is es­ca­lat­ing.”</p>
    <p>But, Dr Bow­man said, the en­vi­ron­ment re­mains sus­cep­ti­ble to fire even with tighter con­trols over hu­man ac­tiv­ity.</p>
    <p>“We can’t pros­e­cute na­ture, but we can reg­u­late hu­mans,” he said.</p>
    <p>Many na­tional and state parks in Aus­tralia, where sum­mer tem­per­a­tures fre­quently ex­ceed 38 deg C, have sea­sonal or to­tal bans on light­ing camp­fires be­cause of the risk they pose to the en­vi­ron­ment.</p>
    <p>Camp­fires are largely banned year round on Fraser Is­land, which is the world’s largest sand is­land and is listed by Unesco as a her­itage site be­cause of its unique ecosys­tem.</p>
    <p>Lo­cal rangers said that wit­nesses had filmed the men and took note of their ve­hi­cles, which helped the au­thor­i­ties bring the charges.</p>
    <p>EF­FECTS OF CLI­MATE CHANGE</p>
    <p>Cli­mate change is mak­ing land­scapes a lot more re­cep­tive to fire be­cause of longer fire sea­sons and drier fuel. The risk of ac­ci­den­tal fires is es­ca­lat­ing.</p>
