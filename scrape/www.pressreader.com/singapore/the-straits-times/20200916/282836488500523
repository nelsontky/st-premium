    <p>BEI­JING • Will wed­ding bells soon ring for Ms Lau­rinda Ho and Chi­nese-Cana­dian ac­tor Shawn Dou?</p>
    <p>The cou­ple have sparked talk of mar­riage since they dis­closed their re­la­tion­ship on so­cial me­dia i n April last year.</p>
    <p>In Oc­to­ber last year, Dou, who shot to fame in Chi­nese di­rec­tor Zhang Yi­mou’s 2010 movie Un­der The Hawthorn Tree, was said to have taken Ms Ho to Canada to meet his par­ents.</p>
    <p>There was even spec­u­la­tion in July that Ms Ho, daugh­ter of late Ma­cau casino ty­coon Stan­ley Ho, and Dou were al­ready mar­ried.</p>
    <p>The ac­tor was seen at the ty­coon’s funeral for three con­sec­u­tive days and it was ru­moured as a son-in­law.</p>
    <p>Ear­lier this week, Ms Ho, 29, and Dou, 31, were spot­ted in his home town in Xi’an, China.</p>
    <p>On Mon­day night, the Shaanxi Huaqing Palace Cul­tural Tourism posted on Weibo pho­tos of the cou­ple in the city, as it wel­comed the cou­ple to watch the live-ac­tion his­tor­i­cal dance drama The Song Of Ever­last­ing Sor­row.</p>
    <p>In one photo, the cou­ple were seen ac­cept­ing a sou­venir from a staff mem­ber; while in an­other, they had their face masks on.</p>
    <p>Ne­ti­zens said they looked like two stu­dents lis­ten­ing at­ten­tively to a teacher with their hands be­hind their backs.</p>
    <p>The cou­ple had at­tended Chi­nese in­flu­encer Grace Chow’s birth­day cel­e­bra­tion last Satur­day be­fore fly­ing to Xi’an.</p>
