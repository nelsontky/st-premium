    <p>GAZA CITY • Is­rael’s army yes­ter­day launched new air strikes against Ha­mas po­si­tions in Gaza and closed the fish­ing zone around the Pales­tinian en­clave in re­sponse to rock­ets and fire­bombs sent into Is­raeli ter­ri­tory.</p>
    <p>The mea­sures came amid height­ened ten­sions, in­clud­ing clashes on Satur­day evening along the Gaza-Is­raeli bor­der.</p>
    <p>Dozens of Pales­tinian “riot­ers burned tyres, hurled ex­plo­sive de­vices and grenades to­wards the se­cu­rity fence and at­tempted to ap­proach it”, the Is­rael De­fence Forces (IDF) said.</p>
    <p>Long sim­mer­ing Pales­tinian anger has flared fur­ther since Is­rael and the United Arab Emi­rates last Thursday agreed to nor­malise re­la­tions, a move Pales­tini­ans saw as a be­trayal of their cause by the Gulf coun­try. Over the past week, Is­raeli forces have car­ried out re­peated night-time strikes on tar­gets linked to the Is­lamist group Ha­mas, which con­trols the Gaza Strip.</p>
    <p>The army said they were in re­sponse to makeshift fire­bombs at­tached to bal­loons and kites that were sent into south­ern Is­rael, caus­ing thou­sands of fires in Is­raeli farms and com­mu­ni­ties.</p>
    <p>There were 19 such Pales­tinian at­tacks on Satur­day alone, Is­raeli res­cue ser­vices said. In re­sponse, “IDF fighter jets and air­craft struck a num­ber of Ha­mas mil­i­tary tar­gets in the Gaza Strip”, the army said.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, the IDF said two more rock­ets had been fired into Is­rael from Gaza and were in­ter­cepted by its de­fence sys­tem. “In re­sponse, our Air Force just struck Ha­mas ter­ror tar­gets in Gaza, in­clud­ing a mil­i­tary com­pound used to store rocket am­mu­ni­tion.”</p>
    <p>After rocket and in­cen­di­ary bal­loon at­tacks in the pre­vi­ous week, Is­rael last Wednesday slashed Gaza’s per­mit­ted coastal fish­ing zone from 15 nau­ti­cal miles to eight, a puni­tive move of­ten used by the Jewish state in re­sponse to Gaza un­rest.</p>
    <p>Fol­low­ing last Satur­day’s clashes and rocket fire, Is­rael’s mil­i­tary de­cided “to en­tirely shut down the fish­ing zone of the Gaza Strip... start­ing this morn­ing”, it said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Is­rael has also closed its Kerem Shalom goods cross­ing with the</p>
    <p>Gaza Strip.</p>
    <p>The IDF said Ha­mas “is re­spon­si­ble for all events tran­spir­ing in the Gaza Strip and em­a­nat­ing from it, and will bear the con­se­quences for ter­ror ac­tiv­ity against Is­raeli civil­ians”.</p>
