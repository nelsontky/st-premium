    <p>Guid­ing prin­ci­ples pro­posed by the Na­tional Trades Union Congress (NTUC) on con­duct­ing re­trench­ments fairly will be in­cor­po­rated into the tri­par­tite ad­vi­sory on man­ag­ing ex­cess man­power and re­spon­si­ble re­trench­ment.</p>
    <p>This means em­ploy­ers and the Govern­ment have agreed to in­clude at least some el­e­ments of the labour movement’s Fair Re­trench­ment Frame­work in the ad­vi­sory, as lay­offs rise amid the Covid-19 pan­demic. The Straits Times un­der­stands details are still be­ing worked out.</p>
    <p>Deputy Prime Min­is­ter Heng Swee Keat, who an­nounced the up­date to the ad­vi­sory yes­ter­day, said re­trench­ments will be in­evitable, even with the Govern­ment’s best ef­forts.</p>
    <p>“For those of you who have fallen on hard times, we will con­tinue to sup­port you and walk this jour­ney with you,” he said.</p>
    <p>The Fair Re­trench­ment Frame­work was an­nounced by the NTUC last month amid a wave of lay­offs.</p>
    <p>In­te­grated re­sorts op­er­a­tor Re­sorts World Sen­tosa had laid off an es­ti­mated 2,000 work­ers, while air­craft main­te­nance firm Ea­gle Ser­vices Asia laid off more than 140 work­ers last month.</p>
    <p>Among other things, the frame­work says firms should pro­tect the Sin­ga­porean core of the work­force, while for­eign­ers with crit­i­cal skills can be re­tained as well.</p>
    <p>It also says com­pa­nies should act early and ex­plore cost-cut­ting mea­sures such as wage cuts and sec­ond­ments be­fore considerin­g re­trench­ments, and where lay­offs are in­evitable, they should pro­vide fair re­trench­ment pack­ages and pro­cesses.</p>
    <p>The tri­par­tite ad­vi­sory on man­ag­ing ex­cess man­power and re­spon­si­ble re­trench­ment was last up­dated in March.</p>
    <p>Among other things, it high­lights other op­tions be­sides re­trench­ment, such as staff train­ing, or “time bank­ing” unused work­ing hours to be re­paid when busi­ness picks up.</p>
