    <p>My 10-month-old fe­male dog, a husky cross spitz, is shed­ding quite a lot (right). Is the un­der­ly­ing cause di­etary, med­i­cal or some­thing that is sea­sonal? San­dra Soh</p>
    <p>Shed­ding of fur is a nor­mal process for many an­i­mals, in­clud­ing dogs. The quan­tity and fre­quency of fur shed­ding de­pend on the breed and ge­net­ics. What may ap­pear to be ex­ces­sive shed­ding in some breeds may be nor­mal for oth­ers.</p>
    <p>Ex­ces­sive shed­ding could be due to fac­tors such as stress, nu­tri­tion or med­i­cal is­sues. Do you no­tice more fre­quent shed­ding re­cently? Has there been a re­cent change in the en­vi­ron­ment, such as a new pet or ex­ces­sive noise near your home?</p>
    <p>Af­ter en­sur­ing that your pet is in a stress-free en­vi­ron­ment, it is im­por­tant to check that it has a com­plete and bal­anced diet that is ap­pro­pri­ate for its stage of life. Your vet or vet­eri­nary nurse will be able to guide you. Do also keep up-to-date with anti-par­a­sitic treat­ments as par­a­sites can af­fect skin con­di­tion, which may present as fur loss.</p>
    <p>Af­ter elim­i­nat­ing stress and nu­tri­tional fac­tors and the shed­ding of fur is still con­sid­ered ex­ces­sive or in­creas­ing in quan­tity or fre­quency, your vet may have to in­ves­ti­gate pos­si­ble un­der­ly­ing med­i­cal is­sues, such as al­ler­gies, fun­gal or bac­te­rial skin in­fec­tions and meta­bolic is­sues.</p>
    <p>Some of these i ssues can be picked up with rou­tine blood tests, as part of reg­u­lar vet­eri­nary health screen­ings.</p>
