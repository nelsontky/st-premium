    <p>MI­AMI • Fin­ish­ing a maiden Iron­man is a huge mo­ment for any triath­lete but when 21-year-old Chris Ni­kic crossed the line at the week­end, he be­came the first ath­lete with Down syn­drome to achieve the feat.</p>
    <p>Nearly 17 hours af­ter em­bark­ing on the 3.86km swim, 180km bike ride and full 42km marathon, he ar­rived just in­side the cut-off point for the Panama City Beach Iron­man event.</p>
    <p>His ef­fort earned him a place in the Guin­ness World Records and thou­sands of so­cial me­dia fol­low­ers have been in­spired by his de­ter­mi­na­tion to tackle one of sport’s tough­est chal­lenges.</p>
    <p>Spec­ta­tors cheered as the Florida res­i­dent crossed the line last Satur­day with his trainer Dan Grieb, who acted as guide, well af­ter dark and with 14 min­utes to spare to record a time.</p>
    <p>The of­fi­cial Iron­man Twit­ter ac­count said he “shat­tered bar­ri­ers” and proved “any­thing is pos­si­ble!” A YouTube video showed Ni­kic in ac­tion with his proud fa­ther Nik close to tears in the tran­si­tion zone be­fore the marathon sec­tion which he com­pleted in 6hr 18min.</p>
    <p>“You are al­most an Iron­man buddy. You’re two thirds of an Iron­man,” his fa­ther said.</p>
    <p>Ni­kic, who was born with the ge­netic con­di­tion that causes de­grees of learn­ing dis­abil­ity and slower phys­i­cal de­vel­op­ment, took up triathlon three years ago af­ter four ear surg­eries kept him liv­ing a more seden­tary life­style and gain­ing weight.</p>
    <p>He set a tar­get of be­com­ing 1 per cent fit­ter each day, be­gin­ning with one push-up. Now he trains six days a week.</p>
    <p>“He’s train­ing with peo­ple, and in the process of train­ing with him, they in­cluded him in what they do,” Nik told the Panama City News Her­ald. “They in­vite him to din­ners and lunches and par­ties... this pro­ject has given him a whole new world of in­clu­sion.</p>
    <p>“Iron­man has served as his plat­form to be­come a step closer to his goal of liv­ing a life of in­clu­sion, nor­malcy and lead­er­ship. It’s about be­ing an ex­am­ple to other kids and fam­i­lies that face sim­i­lar bar­ri­ers, prov­ing no dream is too high.”</p>
    <p>On his In­sta­gram ac­count, which has bal­looned to 81,000 fol­low­ers, Ni­kic said he was fo­cused on his next goal.</p>
    <p>“Goal set and achieved. Time to set a new and BIG­GER Goal for 2021,” he wrote. “What­ever it is the strat­egy is the same. 1% Bet­ter ev­ery day. YES, I did the work but I had an­gels help­ing me.”</p>
    <p>Coach Grieb, an Iron­man vet­eran, said work­ing with Ni­kic had opened his eyes to a new world.</p>
    <p>“Best 16 hours, 46 min­utes and 9 sec­onds of my life!” he posted on In­sta­gram.</p>
    <p>Amer­i­can tennis great Bil­lie Jean King, a life­long cam­paigner for in­clu­sion, of­fered her con­grat­u­la­tions. “No lim­its. No bound­aries,” she tweeted. “Keep dream­ing big and go­ing for it, Chris!”</p>
    <p>Ni­kic is now tar­get­ing the 2022 Spe­cial Olympics in Florida.</p>
