    <p>We thank the Fo­rum let­ter writ­ers who of­fered sug­ges­tions on how work­place dis­crim­i­na­tion could be tack­led. Tri­par­tite part­ners agree that it is crit­i­cal to up­hold the prin­ci­ple of fair­ness and elim­i­nate dis­crim­i­na­tory work­place prac­tices.</p>
    <p>In ev­ery case brought to our at­ten­tion, it is only right to hear out both par­ties and ex­am­ine the facts. On that ba­sis, we had clar­i­fied ear­lier that the em­ployer cited by the As­so­ci­a­tion of Women for Ac­tion and Re­search did not prac­tise age dis­crim­i­na­tion (New law needed to tackle dis­crim­i­na­tion, wrong­ful dis­missal, Sept 29). On the con­trary, it had a healthy share of se­nior work­ers.</p>
    <p>The Gov­ern­ment does not pre­clude the use of leg­is­la­tion to en­force fair em­ploy­ment prac­tices. For ex­am­ple, we in­tro­duced the Re­tire­ment Age Act in 1993 and the Re­tire­ment and Re-em­ploy­ment Act in 2012 to sup­port se­niors who wish to con­tinue work­ing.</p>
    <p>How­ever, as high­lighted by Nanyang Tech­no­log­i­cal Univer­sity as­so­ciate pro­fes­sors Steven Ang and Den­nis Ong (Speak­ing of equal­ity – let’s ex­tend that to work­place law, Oct 10), such laws can have un­in­tended ef­fects, like de­ter­ring em­ploy­ers from hir­ing se­niors in the first place.</p>
    <p>In Sin­ga­pore’s case, se­nior em­ploy­ment rate has in­creased from 57.2 per cent in 2009 to 67.6 per cent last year. Their un­em­ploy­ment rate has re­mained lower than or com­pa­ra­ble to the gen­eral work­force. In con­trast, coun­tries like Britain and the United States have age dis­crim­i­na­tion laws but lower se­nior em­ploy­ment rates.</p>
    <p>Im­prove­ments in Sin­ga­pore have come about also through ex­pand­ing em­ploy­ment op­por­tu­ni­ties and skills developmen­t, which laws, on their own, can­not guar­an­tee for any group of em­ploy­ees.</p>
    <p>Ex­cept for cycli­cal down­turns, Sin­ga­pore’s labour mar­ket re­mained tight. The Gov­ern­ment sup­ports se­nior em­ploy­ment. The Spe­cial Em­ploy­ment Credit pro­vides em­ploy­ers with wage off­sets while the Pro­duc­tiv­ity</p>
    <p>So­lu­tions Grant sup­ports re­design­ing jobs to be more age-friendly.</p>
    <p>The Jobs Growth In­cen­tive also spurs em­ploy­ers to ex­pand lo­cal hir­ing, with sup­port dou­bled for new hires aged 40 and above.</p>
    <p>Over­all, complaints of dis­crim­i­na­tion have fallen from about 17 per 100,000 work­ers in 2015 to an av­er­age of six per 100,000 work­ers in the past three years.</p>
    <p>While keep­ing an open mind on new laws to ad­dress work­place dis­crim­i­na­tion, we should also recog­nise the good out­comes achieved through a multi-pronged ap­proach.</p>
    <p>We in­vite non-gov­ern­men­tal or­gan­i­sa­tions to work with us so cases that come to their at­ten­tion can be fol­lowed up in a timely man­ner.</p>
    <p>The Min­istry of Man­power will con­tinue to mon­i­tor the sit­u­a­tion and work with tri­par­tite part­ners to en­sure fair­ness at work­places. Lee Chung Wei</p>
