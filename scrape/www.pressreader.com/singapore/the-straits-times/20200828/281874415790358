    <p>PARIS • A new study l ook­ing at male and fe­male im­mune re­sponses to the coro­n­avirus may shed new light on why men are more likely to be­come se­ri­ously ill with Covid-19, re­searchers have said.</p>
    <p>Since early in the pan­demic it has been clear that men, par­tic­u­larly older men, are at a far higher risk of dy­ing from the virus than women of a sim­i­lar age, but sci­en­tists have not yet been able to pin­point ex­actly why.</p>
    <p>A new study pub­lished in the jour­nal Na­ture on Wed­nes­day noted that men ac­count for about 60 per cent of deaths from Covid-19 glob­ally and looked at whether dif­fer­ences in im­mune re­sponses could ex­plain why.</p>
    <p>“What we found was that men and women in­deed de­velop dif­fer­ent types of im­mune re­sponses to Covid-19,” the study’s lead au­thor Akiko Iwasaki, a pro­fes­sor at Yale Uni­ver­sity, said in a video.</p>
    <p>The i mmu­nity spe­cial­ist said “th­ese dif­fer­ences may un­der­lie height­ened dis­ease sus­cep­ti­bil­ity in men”.</p>
    <p>Re­searchers col­lected nasal, saliva and blood sam­ples from non­in­fected con­trol sub­jects and pa­tients with the dis­ease who were treated at Yale New Haven Hospi­tal in the United States.</p>
    <p>They then mon­i­tored pa­tients to look at their im­mune re­sponses.</p>
    <p>Re­searchers found that women mounted a more ro­bust im­mune re­sponse in­volv­ing T lym­pho­cytes, which are a type of white blood cells that can recog­nise viruses and elim­i­nate them. This was the case even among older women, the study found.</p>
    <p>In con­trast, older men had weaker T cell ac­tiv­ity – the older they were, the weaker the re­sponse.</p>
    <p>Over­all, men also pro­duced more cy­tokines, which are in­flam­ma­tory pro­teins that form an­other part of the body’s nat­u­ral i mmune de­fence.</p>
    <p>How­ever, se­vere cases of Covid-19 have been linked to what is known as a “cy­tokine storm”, when the im­mune sys­tem goes into over­drive, which is harm­ful and po­ten­tially deadly.</p>
    <p>Men who showed high con­cen­tra­tions early on were more likely to have a se­vere case of the dis­ease, while those women who also showed sig­nif­i­cant cy­tokine lev­els also ap­peared to fare worse, the study found.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to the au­thors, this could im­ply that men and women need dif­fer­ent treat­ments.</p>
    <p>For men, for ex­am­ple “we should be en­hanc­ing their T cell re­sponses with vac­cines”, Dr Iwasaki said, while women could be given treat­ment to dampen the cy­tokine re­sponse.</p>
    <p>But the study has lim­i­ta­tions. Firstly, the sam­ple size was rel­a­tively small, with 98 pa­tients in to­tal.</p>
    <p>The av­er­age age of the pa­tients was also high, at around 60 years.</p>
    <p>Com­ment­ing on the re­search, Dr Eleanor Ri­ley, a pro­fes­sor at the Uni­ver­sity of Ed­in­burgh, said some of the di­ver­gence noted in the study is</p>
    <p>“likely due to dif­fer­ences in age or BMI (as the sex dif­fer­ences dis­ap­pear once th­ese other fac­tors are taken into ac­count)”. BMI mea­sures body fat. She said oth­ers could have arisen “by chance”.</p>
    <p>“Im­por­tantly, al­though the av­er­age re­sponse may dif­fer be­tween men and women, the range of most of the mea­sure­ments in men and women over­lap sig­nif­i­cantly, mean­ing that many women have re­sponses that are in­dis­tin­guish­able from those of many men,” she added.</p>
    <p>Dr Ri­ley said this is why treat­ments would be bet­ter if they were in­di­vid­u­ally tai­lored, rather than de­fined solely on sex.</p>
    <p>Re­searchers found that women mounted a more ro­bust im­mune re­sponse in­volv­ing T lym­pho­cytes, which are a type of white blood cells that can recog­nise viruses and elim­i­nate them. This was the case even among older women, the study found.</p>
