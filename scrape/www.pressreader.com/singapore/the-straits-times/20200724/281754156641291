    <p>For Raf­fles City, the lo­ca­tion vis­ited in the mall was the Raf­fles City Mar­ket Place, while for Golden Mile it was the Diandin Leluk Thai Restau­rant.</p>
    <p>Other places added to the list yes­ter­day in­clude Sem­bawang Com­mu­nity Club, VivoCity’s Soup Restau­rant and FairPrice Xtra out­lets, Safra Yishun’s Pin Si Restau­rant and the Jurong East sub-branch of the In­dus­trial and Com­mer­cial Bank of China.</p>
    <p>The min­istry pro­vides the list of lo­ca­tions and times that in­fec­tious Covid-19 pa­tients vis­ited for at least 30 min­utes to get those who were at these places at spe­cific pe­ri­ods to mon­i­tor their health closely for two weeks from the date of their visit.</p>
    <p>MOH has said close con­tacts would al­ready have been no­ti­fied and that there is no need to avoid these places as they would have been cleaned, if needed.</p>
    <p>There were 354 new coro­n­avirus cases con­firmed yes­ter­day, tak­ing Sin­ga­pore’s to­tal to 49,098.</p>
    <p>They in­cluded eight com­mu­nity cases, com­pris­ing four Sin­ga­pore­ans and four work per­mit hold­ers.</p>
    <p>There were also five im­ported coro­n­avirus cases yes­ter­day – two per­ma­nent res­i­dents, two work pass hold­ers and one de­pen­dant’s pass holder.</p>
    <p>They were placed on stay-home no­tices upon ar­rival in Sin­ga­pore from In­dia be­tween July 11 and 12. All were asymp­to­matic and tested pos­i­tive while serv­ing their no­tices.</p>
    <p>Two of the im­ported cases were a boy and a girl, both aged 12, who re­turned from In­dia. Both are PRs and tested pos­i­tive on Wed­nes­day.</p>
    <p>Mi­grant work­ers stay­ing in dor­mi­to­ries made up the 341 re­main­ing cases.</p>
    <p>The av­er­age num­ber of new daily cases in the com­mu­nity dur­ing a week has de­creased from 12 cases two weeks ago to nine in the past week.</p>
    <p>The num­ber of un­linked cases in the com­mu­nity dur­ing a week has de­creased from the daily av­er­age of seven cases two weeks ago to the daily av­er­age of five in the past week.</p>
