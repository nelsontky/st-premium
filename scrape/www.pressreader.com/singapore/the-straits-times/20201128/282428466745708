    <p>A 49-year-old man was sen­tenced to four weeks’ jail yes­ter­day for ac­cept­ing $6,000 in bribes while he was work­ing as the health, en­vi­ron­ment and safety spe­cial­ist with Chevron Sin­ga­pore at its lube oil blend­ing plant.</p>
    <p>Cheow Hock Mun was also or­dered to pay a penalty sum of $6,000, in de­fault of which he will have to serve 20 days’ jail.</p>
    <p>The per­ma­nent res­i­dent had pleaded guilty on Oct 9 to two counts of re­ceiv­ing a bribe in re­turn for be­ing le­nient in su­per­vis­ing work done by the sub­con­trac­tor, LGC En­gi­neer­ing and Con­trac­tors (LGC), at the plant. An­other sim­i­lar charge was taken into con­sid­er­a­tion dur­ing sen­tenc­ing by Dis­trict Judge Edgar Foo.</p>
    <p>Court doc­u­ments stated that Cheow was in charge of all safety and se­cu­rity mat­ters at the plant in</p>
    <p>Jalan Buroh. He also over­saw the is­su­ing of per­mits and train­ing of work­ers at the plant.</p>
    <p>Cheow ac­cepted the money from Lim Gim Chuan, man­ag­ing direc­tor of LGC, on three oc­ca­sions be­tween April and July 2015.</p>
    <p>Lim was aware that Cheow was the over­all in charge of safety at the plant, and that he had the author­ity to make things dif­fi­cult by not ap­prov­ing the per­mits for his work­ers or by find­ing faults in their safety as­pects. This would even­tu­ally cause de­lays and fi­nan­cial losses for Lim’s com­pany.</p>
    <p>Court doc­u­ments said that some time in April 2015, Lim asked to meet Cheow at the can­teen of the plant, where he of­fered Cheow $2,000 and, in Hokkien, asked for “a help­ing hand”.</p>
    <p>Cheow un­der­stood that Lim meant for him to en­sure a “smooth op­er­a­tion” of his com­pany’s works at the oil plant. Cheow later took $2,000 from Lim.</p>
    <p>Lim gave him a sim­i­lar amount on two other oc­ca­sions.</p>
    <p>Cheow sub­se­quently ap­proved per­mits and the com­mence­ment of work by Lim’s com­pany with­out be­ing dif­fi­cult.</p>
    <p>He also helped to speed up the en­dorse­ment of doc­u­ments for Lim’s com­pany, and con­ducted ad­di­tional train­ing for his work­ers.</p>
    <p>Lim was jailed for 10 weeks in June for var­i­ous cor­rup­tion of­fences, in­clud­ing his in­volve­ment in this case.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, Dis­trict Judge Foo granted Cheow’s re­quest to de­fer his jail term to next Mon­day as he is cur­rently re­cov­er­ing from an eye op­er­a­tion.</p>
    <p>For each of­fence of cor­rup­tion, Cheow could have been jailed for up to five years, or fined up to $100,000, or both.</p>
