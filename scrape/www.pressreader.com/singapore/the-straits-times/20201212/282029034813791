    <p>At this time a year ago, Pres­i­dent Joko Wi­dodo had am­ple rea­sons to feel good about his po­lit­i­cal po­si­tion and In­done­sia’s out­look for 2020.</p>
    <p>Last year, he won re-elec­tion with a wider mar­gin, then con­tro­ver­sially put com­bat­ive two-time elec­toral op­po­nent Prabowo Su­bianto in his new Cab­i­net – fos­ter­ing po­lit­i­cal sta­bil­ity af­ter vi­o­lent post-elec­tion protests by Prabowo sup­port­ers.</p>
    <p>With a size­able ma­jor­ity in Par­lia­ment, the Pres­i­dent could be sure it would pass a mas­sive re­form Bill, on which draft­ing had started, that he viewed as a game-changer for In­done­sia’s of­ten-dissed in­vest­ment cli­mate. And the global eco­nomic pic­ture was im­prov­ing, as Wash­ing­ton and Bei­jing moved to­wards a phase one deal to ease their trade dis­pute.</p>
    <p>Jokowi, as the Pres­i­dent is pop­u­larly known, also had great plans for In­done­sia. Late last year, he set in mo­tion plan­ning for a new cap­i­tal in a re­mote in­land part of East Kal­i­man­tan prov­ince, on Bor­neo is­land, to re­place sink­ing Jakarta. And Jokowi, who like Suharto made eco­nomic devel­op­ment a big pri­or­ity, tar­geted a long-term goal of In­done­sia be­ing a top five econ­omy with per capita in­comes of nearly US$25,000 by its 100th birth­day in 2045.</p>
    <p>The Covid-19 night­mare ended a lot of dreams and lives, and turned 2020 into the rough­est year for the for­mer fur­ni­ture maker who has led In­done­sia since 2014. The pan­demic has caused the first re­ces­sion in In­done­sia since the Asian fi­nan­cial cri­sis more than 20 years ago. Econ­o­mists gen­er­ally ex­pect 2020 shrink­age of 1.5 per cent to 2 per cent; some In­done­sian of­fi­cials point out this is a lot less than in most coun­tries, but it was bad enough to put mil­lions out of work, at least tem­po­rar­ily, and erase years of ad­vance in re­duc­ing poverty.</p>
    <p>Since 2014, In­done­sia’s gross do­mes­tic prod­uct (GDP) has grown on av­er­age 5 per cent per year, short of the 7 per cent growth rates that Jokowi said he ex­pected to reach. Now, given the Covid-in­duced blows, the 2021 bud­get pre­sented to Par­lia­ment in Au­gust as­sumes GDP growth of 4.5 per cent to 5.5 per cent next year.</p>
    <p>In one re­spect, In­done­sia is for­tu­nate in that do­mes­tic con­sump­tion un­der­pins the econ­omy and not tourism, so its hit is smaller than Thai­land’s. The In­ter­na­tional Mone­tary Fund has fore­cast 6.1 per cent growth, but Dr Chatib Basri, fi­nance min­is­ter un­der Mr Susilo Bam­bang Yud­hoy­ono, Jokowi’s pre­de­ces­sor, thinks 6 per cent is too op­ti­mistic as con­sump­tion – which ac­counts for more than half of GDP – will likely re­main anaemic. At this stage, he fore­casts 4 per cent and ex­pects the growth path to look like Nike’s “swoosh”.</p>
    <p>“If we don’t get the pan­demic un­der con­trol, the econ­omy can’t work at 100 per cent,” Dr Basri says. “Only 70-80 per cent at most.”</p>
    <p>Mis­man­aged re­sponse</p>
    <p>In­done­sia’s early re­sponse to Covid-19 was dis­may­ing, with pre­var­i­ca­tion, de­nials and mis­steps. It was dam­ag­ing that some Cab­i­net mem­bers made non­sen­si­cal state­ments that health drinks, eu­ca­lyp­tus neck­laces or prayer could pro­tect peo­ple from the virus. Jokowi ad­mit­ted ini­tially with­hold­ing news of the coun­try’s first fa­tal­ity be­cause he didn’t want to cause panic.</p>
    <p>And Covid-19 has ex­posed the woe­ful state of In­done­sia’s pub­lic health sys­tem. There’s been a shock­ing num­ber of fa­tal­i­ties among doctors (more than 150), in­clud­ing a se­nior ra­di­ol­o­gist who died at the start of this month be­cause a ven­ti­la­tor wasn’t avail­able in Surabaya, the sec­ond-big­gest city. His wife died too.</p>
    <p>Look­ing to next year, Jokowi faces many chal­lenges, but one is dom­i­nant: to do much bet­ter in bat­tling the pan­demic, in par­tic­u­lar by mak­ing vac­ci­nat­ing cam­paigns – which must over­come daunt­ing lo­gis­ti­cal is­sues – go smoothly, un­like ef­forts to mit­i­gate the coro­n­avirus. The con­firmed to­tal num­ber of Covid-19 cases yes­ter­day crossed the 600,000 mark, in­clud­ing over 18,500 deaths, the high­est in South-east Asia.</p>
    <p>En­cour­ag­ingly, In­done­sia has al­ready re­ceived some vac­cines from China, though the num­ber of doses is small. The 1.2 mil­lion doses from Si­no­vac Biotech are just enough for some 600,000 peo­ple – as each per­son must re­ceive two doses – and it’s not clear when reg­u­la­tors can ap­prove their use.</p>
    <p>Jokowi has said sim­u­la­tions have been un­der way in sev­eral prov­inces and he is “sure ev­ery­thing will be ready” for the mass vac­ci­na­tion cam­paign. Tens of mil­lions of peo­ple will hope he’s right; the cam­paign could take years, and there are doubts about how ef­fi­cient it will be.</p>
    <p>The dis­cour­ag­ing news is that Covid-19 cases have been spik­ing, like in so many places, and could worsen af­ter Wed­nes­day’s lo­cal elec­tions, when about 100 mil­lion peo­ple were out to vote. Mean­while, test­ing re­mains dis­tress­ingly low.</p>
    <p>Other chal­lenges</p>
    <p>While launch­ing an ef­fec­tive vac­ci­na­tion cam­paign and con­tain­ing Covid-19 is clearly Jokowi’s big­gest 2021 chal­lenge, there are other press­ing is­sues de­mand­ing his at­ten­tion. Th­ese in­clude:</p>
    <p>HAN­DLING FIERY MUS­LIM CLERIC RIZIEQ SHIHAB</p>
    <p>Mr Rizieq re­turned to Jakarta late last month from self-im­posed ex­ile in Saudi Ara­bia, where he fled af­ter a crim­i­nal charge in­volv­ing pornog­ra­phy was placed against him. (It was later dropped.)</p>
    <p>Mr Rizieq, an op­po­nent of Jokowi who heads the con­tro­ver­sial Is­lamic De­fend­ers Front, led the 2016-17 cam­paign to push out then Jakarta Gov­er­nor Ba­suki Tja­haja Pur­nama, known as Ahok, a Chris­tian ac­cused and jailed for blas­phemy against</p>
    <p>Is­lam. Mr Rizieq, who was met by thou­sands of white-robed fol­low­ers on his re­turn, has called for a “moral rev­o­lu­tion” and bla­tantly vi­o­lated safe dis­tanc­ing rules at Jakarta gath­er­ings.</p>
    <p>Early on Mon­day, po­lice, who as­serted they were at­tacked first on a high­way, shot dead six of the cleric’s body­guards, which has in­creased ten­sion be­tween Mr Rizieq and Jokowi’s gov­ern­ment.</p>
    <p>Han­dling rad­i­cal Is­lamists is a del­i­cate is­sue for Jokowi, who wants to pro­tect plu­ral­ism en­shrined in the Con­sti­tu­tion of In­done­sia, the world’s most pop­u­lous Mus­lim-ma­jor­ity na­tion.</p>
    <p>THE COR­RUP­TION SCOURGE</p>
    <p>The ar­rest of two Cab­i­net min­is­ters in less than two weeks – one sus­pected of steal­ing money from the Covid-19 re­lief pro­gramme – re­minds In­done­sians that cor­rup­tion re­mains a big prob­lem. Jokowi is pop­u­lar with In­done­sians be­cause he is clean, but he cre­ated un­hap­pi­ness last year by ap­prov­ing amend­ments that weak­ened the Cor­rup­tion Erad­i­ca­tion Com­mis­sion. In­done­sians will be watch­ing to see if changes are now made to re-strengthen it.</p>
    <p>IM­PROV­ING THE IN­VEST­MENT CLI­MATE</p>
    <p>The im­ple­ment­ing reg­u­la­tions for the 1,187-page “om­nibus” law that was passed in Oc­to­ber, fuelling na­tion­wide protests by labour groups, will be pub­lished next year and con­tro­ver­sial sec­tions on labour and en­vi­ron­ment will be of par­tic­u­lar in­ter­est.</p>
    <p>The law is Jokowi’s ef­fort to slash red tape and en­cour­age pri­vate for­eign and do­mes­tic in­vest­ment in man­u­fac­tur­ing. In­done­sia has not fared well against Viet­nam in the quest for in­vest­ments. And Viet­nam, a rare coun­try that will have eco­nomic growth this year, is likely to get even stronger as a com­peti­tor be­cause of its solid record con­tain­ing the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>BOOST­ING SKILLS AND ED­U­CA­TION</p>
    <p>It’s some­times said In­done­sia will get a “de­mo­graphic div­i­dend” be­cause of its young pop­u­la­tion, but this won’t be col­lected if skill lev­els aren’t raised sharply, and Covid-19 has in­creased un­em­ploy­ment.</p>
    <p>On ed­u­ca­tion, there’s been wel­come news re­cently as Aus­tralia’s Monash Univer­sity, which has been try­ing for years af­ter open­ing a Malaysian cam­pus, has won ap­proval to open the first for­eign-owned cam­pus in In­done­sia. But there’s big re­sis­tance to change in the Ed­u­ca­tion Ministry’s bu­reau­cracy, and it is not clear that in gen­eral the door will be opened to many for­eign in­sti­tu­tions.</p>
    <p>Jokowi, af­ter this an­nus hor­ri­bilis, still has the bulk of his sec­ond term left. (His ten­ure will end in</p>
    <p>Oc­to­ber 2024, thanks to In­done­sia’s wis­dom in lim­it­ing a post-Suharto era pres­i­dent to just two five-year terms.)</p>
    <p>Some In­done­sians be­lieve Jokowi still wants to at least start con­struc­tion of a new cap­i­tal while in of­fice. But ide­ally he should fo­cus in­stead on help­ing build In­done­sia back bet­ter for the post-Covid-19 pe­riod, mak­ing it cleaner (en­vi­ron­men­tally and eth­i­cally), ex­pand­ing the strengths of its cul­tural and re­li­gious diver­sity, and im­prov­ing its con­nec­tions with the world. In­done­sia needs in­sti­tu­tion-build­ing more than a new cap­i­tal.</p>
