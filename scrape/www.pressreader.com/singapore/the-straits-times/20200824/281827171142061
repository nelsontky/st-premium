    <p>BANGKOK • In just four days, the rep­u­ta­tion of a Bud­dhist monk who has spent decades fight­ing for the hu­man rights of Cam­bo­di­ans was de­stroyed.</p>
    <p>First, grainy videos ap­peared on a fake Face­book page, claim­ing that he had slept with three sis­ters and their mother.</p>
    <p>Then a govern­ment-con­trolled re­li­gious coun­cil de­frocked the monk for hav­ing vi­o­lated Bud­dhist pre­cepts of celibacy.</p>
    <p>Fear­ing im­mi­nent ar­rest, the monk fled Cam­bo­dia, des­tined for a life in ex­ile, like so many peo­ple who have stood up to Asia’s long­est-gov­ern­ing leader.</p>
    <p>The monk, Luon So­vath, was the vic­tim of a smear cam­paign this sum­mer that re­lied on fake claims and hastily as­sem­bled so­cial me­dia ac­counts de­signed to dis­credit an out­spo­ken critic of the coun­try’s au­thor­i­tar­ian poli­cies.</p>
    <p>The four videos con­sist of noth­ing more than fuzzy footage of smart­phones with the monk’s fake Face­book pro­file on the screens.</p>
    <p>Au­dio seems to em­anate from the phones, as if he is chat­ting with the women on Mes­sen­ger.</p>
    <p>A New York Times in­ves­ti­ga­tion found ev­i­dence that govern­ment em­ploy­ees were in­volved in the cre­ation and post­ing of the videos on Face­book.</p>
    <p>His down­fall shows how re­pres­sive gov­ern­ments can move with stun­ning speed to dis­grace their op­po­nents, us­ing so­cial me­dia and tech­nol­ogy to am­plify their di­vi­sive cam­paigns.</p>
    <p>Un­der Prime Min­is­ter Hun Sen, the Cam­bo­dian govern­ment has re­peat­edly used fal­si­fied Face­book posts or ma­nip­u­lated au­dio to de­fame and im­prison politi­cians, ac­tivists and other hu­man rights de­fend­ers.</p>
    <p>Face­book has come un­der fire in the United States for dis­sem­i­nat­ing hate speech and dis­in­for­ma­tion. It has been crit­i­cised for fail­ing to de­tect Rus­sian in­flu­ence in the 2016 elec­tion, pro­vid­ing a plat­form for con­spir­acy the­o­ries and al­low­ing false claims about the coro­n­avirus to pro­lif­er­ate.</p>
    <p>But its in­flu­ence is even greater in places like Cam­bo­dia, where the so­cial me­dia plat­form is the only dig­i­tal in­ter­face for mil­lions of peo­ple. Since civil lib­er­ties are of­ten con­stricted in such coun­tries, Face­book can be a pow­er­ful tool for au­to­crats to bol­ster their grip on the state, even as it pro­vides a rare space for free ex­pres­sion and ac­tivism.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing his nearly 35-year rule, Mr Hun Sen – a one-time sol­dier for the geno­ci­dal Kh­mer Rouge and now an en­thu­si­as­tic Face­book user – has dec­i­mated Cam­bo­dia’s po­lit­i­cal op­po­si­tion.</p>
    <p>He has cosied up to China, eschew­ing aid from the West that was con­di­tioned on im­prov­ing hu­man rights. Many high-pro­file ac­tivists and op­po­si­tion politi­cians have been as­sas­si­nated, their cases rarely in­ves­ti­gated prop­erly.</p>
    <p>As scan­dals pro­lif­er­ate on its plat­form, Face­book has been crit­i­cised for be­ing too slow in re­mov­ing prob­lem­atic ac­counts and pages, many fake. It took al­most a month for Face­book to take down the page on which the videos smear­ing the monk first aired.</p>
    <p>“As a com­pany, you would think they would want to be more vig­i­lant and not al­low their plat­form to be mis­used,” said Ms Naly Pilorge, di­rec­tor of the Cam­bo­dian League for the Pro­mo­tion and De­fence of Hu­man Rights. “Face­book’s re­ac­tion has been like lit­tle drops from a sink, so late and so lit­tle.”</p>
    <p>In a state­ment about the case, Face­book said it had built up a team in Cam­bo­dia to bet­ter mon­i­tor the lo­cal sit­u­a­tion.</p>
    <p>Last month, Luon So­vath, who is now in Switzer­land af­ter re­ceiv­ing a hu­man­i­tar­ian visa, was charged in ab­sen­tia by pros­e­cu­tors in Siem Reap prov­ince with rap­ing one of the sis­ters, es­ca­lat­ing the ac­cu­sa­tions in the videos.</p>
    <p>The sex charges against Luon So­vath, one of Cam­bo­dia’s most cel­e­brated ac­tivist monks, went vi­ral. Copies of the videos, which pur­ported to show Face­book Mes­sen­ger calls be­tween the monk and some of the women, were shared widely on the so­cial me­dia plat­form. He has de­nied the rape charges, along with ac­cu­sa­tions that he had sex­ual re­la­tions with any of the women.</p>
    <p>Clues in the videos, un­cov­ered by The New York Times, also un­der­cut the claims.</p>
    <p>An anal­y­sis found split-sec­ond footage in which per­sonal in­for­ma­tion of two govern­ment em­ploy­ees briefly flashes on screen.</p>
    <p>The em­ploy­ees work for the Press and Quick Re­ac­tion Unit, a pro­pa­ganda arm of Cam­bo­dia’s Cabi­net.</p>
    <p>The videos were up­loaded on a Face­book page that as­sumed the iden­tity of one of the sis­ters, Ms Tim Ratha, who de­nied both own­er­ship of the page and any sex­ual re­la­tion­ship with the monk.</p>
    <p>The page was cre­ated the day the videos were posted and lifted pho­to­graphs from the sis­ter’s real Face­book ac­count.</p>
    <p>A fake Face­book ac­count in the monk’s name was also linked to the videos. It, too, stole im­ages from Luon So­vath’s real ac­count and was es­tab­lished one day be­fore the videos came out.</p>
    <p>While the Face­book page has been taken down, the videos are still cir­cu­lat­ing. The two govern­ment em­ploy­ees linked to the pro­duc­tion of the videos re­main on Face­book, post­ing make-up tips and memes on their time­lines.</p>
    <p>“We know that Face­book will side with re­pres­sive regimes if their bot­tom line is im­pacted by free­dom of ex­pres­sion is­sues,” said Mr Michael Caster, a hu­man rights re­searcher who has stud­ied tech­nol­ogy use in au­thor­i­tar­ian coun­tries.</p>
    <p>In Switzer­land, Luon So­vath said he was ad­just­ing to life in ex­ile.</p>
    <p>“I want to go home,” he said. “But I had no choice but to run away from my coun­try and be­come a refugee.”</p>
