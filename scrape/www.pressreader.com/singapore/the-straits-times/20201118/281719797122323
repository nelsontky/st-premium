    <p>NEW YORK • One of the big­gest chal­lenges to de­liv­er­ing a promis­ing coro­n­avirus vac­cine based on un­prece­dented tech­nol­ogy to mil­lions world­wide just got eas­ier.</p>
    <p>When Pfizer an­nounced ef­fec­tive pre­lim­i­nary re­sults for its vac­cine can­di­date last week, the down­side was that it must be stored at ul­tra-cold tem­per­a­tures, pos­ing sig­nif­i­cant lo­gis­ti­cal is­sues.</p>
    <p>But Moderna on Mon­day one­upped its ri­val, of­fer­ing a vac­cine based on the same tech­nol­ogy that ap­pears to be equally ef­fec­tive, but which also can be stored at reg­u­lar re­frig­er­ated tem­per­a­tures for up to a month.</p>
    <p>The dif­fer­ence is sig­nif­i­cant. De­liv­er­ing nor­mal vac­cines to pop­u­la­tions in the re­motest re­gions from In­dia to Africa is dif­fi­cult enough just on sup­ply and trans­port is­sues.</p>
    <p>The tem­per­a­ture fac­tor in­tro­duces a far more daunt­ing hur­dle, re­quir­ing coun­tries to build stor­age and trans­porta­tion networks that can main­tain tem­per­a­tures far colder than that re­quired for frozen meat.</p>
    <p>The mas­sive in­vest­ment and co­or­di­na­tion needed raised the like­li­hood that only rich na­tions would be guar­an­teed ac­cess to the drug.</p>
    <p>“The Moderna vac­cine is a much more vi­able op­tion for low- and mid­dle-in­come coun­tries than the Pfizer vac­cine,” said Ms Rachel Sil­ver­man, a Wash­ing­ton-based pol­icy fel­low at the Cen­tre for Global De­vel­op­ment, adding that “cold­stor­age needs are less ex­treme”.</p>
    <p>Not only can Moderna’s vac­cine re­main sta­ble in the fridge for 30 days, it can also be kept in or­di­nary freez­ers for long-term use. Pfizer’s vac­cine has to be kept at mi­nus 70 deg C and could only be re­frig­er­ated for up to five days – at least un­til its re­searchers are able to match Moderna’s break­through.</p>
    <p>“The Moderna vac­cine can be ac­com­mo­dated within the ex­ist­ing vac­cine dis­tri­bu­tion networks,” said As­so­ciate Pro­fes­sor Ayfer Ali, a spe­cial­ist in drug re­search at War­wick Busi­ness School in the UK. “Even in re­mote and un­der­de­vel­oped ar­eas, fridges are avail­able or can be sup­plied cheaply.”</p>
    <p>Although Moderna has cut deals with only a hand­ful of de­vel­oped coun­tries for its vac­cine, it re­ceived fund­ing from the non­profit Coali­tion for Epi­demic Pre­pared­ness In­no­va­tions and may there­fore be bound to help en­able ac­cess in low-mid­dle in­come coun­tries, said Ms Sil­ver­man.</p>
    <p>The Bos­ton-based biotech com­pany’s vac­cine uses the same new and ex­per­i­men­tal mes­sen­ger RNA mech­a­nism as Pfizer’s. The emer­gence of two promis­ing can­di­dates is helping to ease con­cerns that a sin­gle vac­cine will not be nearly enough to meet global de­mand.</p>
    <p>“We will need to use all of the ca­pac­ity that we have and all of the vac­cines that are ef­fec­tive as they come on­line,” As­soc Prof Ali said.</p>
    <p>Pfizer could also make its vac­cine more vi­able by re­for­mu­lat­ing it – pos­si­bly to a freeze-dried form – to avoid the re­frig­er­a­tion is­sue, said Dr Gil­lies O’Bryan-Tear, chair of pol­icy and com­mu­ni­ca­tions at the Fac­ulty of Phar­ma­ceu­ti­cal Medicine in the UK.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, hun­dreds of</p>
    <p>Covid-19 vac­cines are in the pipe­line, and it is pos­si­ble that another, more cost-ef­fec­tive can­di­date will emerge that uses proven tech­nol­ogy and is eas­ier to man­u­fac­ture and ship, ex­perts said.</p>
    <p>“I think it will be­come clear in the next cou­ple of months, there are other vac­cines that are in the pipe­line that are in phase 3,” said Dr Saad Omer, di­rec­tor of the Yale In­sti­tute for Global Health.</p>
    <p>“There will be de­ci­sions about costs of wait­ing ver­sus act­ing. Some might de­cide to wait based on broader char­ac­ter­is­tics and the need for ul­tra-cold chain, I think that will be a big cal­cu­la­tion.”</p>
    <p>Other vac­cine op­tions may be es­sen­tial, as not many ex­ist­ing drug­mak­ers have pro­duc­tion fa­cil­i­ties for mes­sen­ger RNA tech­nol­ogy.</p>
    <p>Mr Adar Poon­awalla, chief ex­ec­u­tive of­fi­cer of the Serum In­sti­tute of In­dia – the world’s largest vac­cine pro­ducer by vol­ume – said he had no plans “to dab­ble with any mes­sen­ger RNA can­di­dates” for at least 21/ years, when a new fa­cil­ity 2 that the com­pany is build­ing has been com­pleted.</p>
    <p>“This kind of in­no­va­tion is great for the long term,” Mr Poon­awalla said in an in­ter­view. But it re­mains a ques­tion how many of them are go­ing to be “use­able” in a prac­ti­cal sense, he added.</p>
