    <p>•</p>
    <p>WASH­ING­TON Democrats are fore­cast to keep con­trol of the US House after Tues­day’s elec­tions, but with at least six in­cum­bents los­ing their seats and oth­ers in jeop­ardy, Repub­li­cans have likely chipped away at their ma­jor­ity.</p>
    <p>Among the Democrats de­feated were sev­eral elected in the 2018 “blue wave” that swept the party into the House ma­jor­ity, as well as chair­man of the House Com­mit­tee on Agri­cul­ture Collin Peter­son, who has rep­re­sented his Min­nesota district since 1991.</p>
    <p>There were 13 other Democrats trail­ing or in tight races in Penn­syl­va­nia, New York, Michi­gan, Iowa, Vir­ginia and Cal­i­for­nia.</p>
    <p>With the losses and the fail­ure to flip tar­geted GOP seats in Illinois, Ohio and Texas, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi will have less room to ma­noeu­vre and will face ques­tions from House Democrats about her strat­egy and pri­or­i­ties leading up the election.</p>
    <p>Democrats also are on the verge of fail­ing in their quest for a Se­nate ma­jor­ity, mean­ing they might have to shelve their most am­bi­tious plans for healthcare, fight­ing cli­mate change and re­spond­ing to the coro­n­avirus epi­demic.</p>
    <p>“It’s not over un­til ev­ery vote is counted,” Ms Pelosi told sup­port­ers, point­ing to races in her home state of Cal­i­for­nia and else­where in the western United States that have not yet been called.</p>
    <p>In ad­di­tion, Ms Pelosi will be fac­ing more pres­sure from the left.</p>
    <p>New York Rep­re­sen­ta­tive Alexan­dria Oca­sio-Cortez eas­ily won re-election and will be joined by sev­eral more self-de­scribed pro­gres­sive mem­bers, in­clud­ing Mr Ja­maal Bow­man, Mr Mondaire Jones and Mr Ritchie Tor­res in New York, and Mis­souri’s Ms Cori Bush, who are re­plac­ing more cen­trist Democrats.</p>
    <p>Democrats took over the House after they net­ted 41 seats in the 2018 midterm elec­tions, the largest sin­gle-year pick-up since the post-Water­gate midterms of 1974. But some of those new Democrats were among the party’s losers on Tues­day.</p>
    <p>In Florida, Demo­cratic Rep­re­sen­ta­tive Deb­bie Mu­carsel-Pow­ell was de­feated by Republican Car­los Gimenez, the Mayor of Mi­ami-Dade County. Demo­crat Donna Sha­lala, for­mer Health and Hu­man Ser­vices sec­re­tary, lost to Republican Maria Elvira Salazar, a broad­cast jour­nal­ist.</p>
    <p>Both dis­tricts have large Latino pop­u­la­tions.</p>
    <p>Three other first-term Democrats lost on Tues­day as well. Ok­la­homa Demo­cratic Rep­re­sen­ta­tive Ken­dra Horn con­ceded in her con­test against Ms Stephanie Bice, though the race had not been of­fi­cially called. And South Carolina Demo­crat Joe Cun­ning­ham lost to Republican chal­lenger Nancy Mace. New Mex­ico’s Ms Xo­chitl Tor­res Small lost to Republican Yvette Her­rell.</p>
    <p>Democrats picked up two for­merly GOP seats that had been re­dis­tricted in North Carolina.</p>
    <p>Part of House Democrats’ pre­elec­tion op­ti­mism came from the num­ber of GOP re­tire­ments and the de­feat of some Republican in­cum­bents in pri­maries.</p>
    <p>But Repub­li­cans held the seat opened up by the re­tire­ment of GOP Rep­re­sen­ta­tive Fran­cis Rooney in Florida. The win­ner of that con­test, Mr By­ron Don­alds, will be the only black Republican in the House. Another open race in Texas for a Waco-area seat now held by re­tir­ing Republican Bill Flores was won by for­mer House Rules Com­mit­tee chair­man Pete Ses­sions, who had been de­feated in his old Dal­las area district in 2018.</p>
    <p>Ms Pelosi, the only woman ever to hold the Speaker’s gavel, has al­ready said she plans to run for re­elec­tion as speaker in the next Congress.</p>
    <p>House Democrats re­turn on Nov 18 and 19 to Wash­ing­ton, along with their mem­bers-elect, to elect lead­ers for the new ses­sion in Jan­uary. That in­cludes nom­i­nat­ing a speaker who must then be elected by the full House of Rep­re­sen­ta­tives.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, 11 gu­ber­na­to­rial con­tests were also held in this year’s election. Mr Greg Gian­forte, Mon­tana’s at-large con­gress­man, will be­come the state’s 25th Gov­er­nor, win­ning the only close race for the gov­er­nor seats.</p>
    <p>Democrats also are on the verge of fail­ing in their quest for a Se­nate ma­jor­ity, mean­ing they might have to shelve their most am­bi­tious plans for healthcare, fight­ing cli­mate change and re­spond­ing to the coro­n­avirus epi­demic.</p>
