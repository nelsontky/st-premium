    <p>LOS AN­GE­LES • Seems like 2021 has its first celebrity cou­ple. Singer Harry Styles, 26, and ac­tress-di­rec­tor Olivia Wilde, 36, ap­peared at a wed­ding – not theirs – hold­ing hands and act­ing all lovey-dovey.</p>
    <p>They are said to have been dat­ing for a few weeks, af­ter sparks flew on the set of Don’t Worry Dar­ling, a hor­ror movie di­rected by Wilde, who also co-stars in it.</p>
    <p>Styles, who has not been in a movie since his first act­ing role in 2017’s Dunkirk, took over as the male lead last Septem­ber from Shia LaBeouf, who dropped out due to a sched­ul­ing con­flict.</p>
    <p>At the wed­ding over the past week­end, held in Mon­tecito, Cal­i­for­nia, Styles was not just a guest, but also of­fi­ci­ated as a friend of the groom, who is his agent.</p>
    <p>There were re­port­edly only 16 guests at the ex­clu­sive wed­ding, and Wilde at­tended as Style’s plus one.</p>
    <p>The two were later snapped on Mon­day re­turn­ing to his Los An­ge­les home with suit­cases, fur­ther fu­elling ru­mours of them dat­ing.</p>
    <p>Nei­ther of their rep­re­sen­ta­tives has com­mented on the al­leged ro­mance.</p>
    <p>Pre­vi­ously, Wilde was in a long-term re­la­tion­ship with ex-fi­ance, ac­tor Ja­son Sudeikis, 45. They were en­gaged for eight years and have two chil­dren, aged six and four, to­gether.</p>
    <p>The cou­ple re­vealed in Novem­ber last year that they had split up at the be­gin­ning of the year, with noth­ing to sug­gest that Styles had played a part in the breakup.</p>
    <p>While there is a 10-year age gap be­tween Styles and Wilde, he is known to have dated older women, such as Vic­to­ria’s Se­cret model Camille Rowe, 30, and singer Tay­lor Swift, 31.</p>
    <p>He also briefly dated late tele­vi­sion pre­sen­ter Caro­line Flack in 2011, when he was 17 and she was 32.</p>
    <p>In Novem­ber, when Styles ap­peared on the ground­break­ing cover of Vogue in a dress, Wilde had spo­ken up to de­fend him against de­trac­tors.</p>
    <p>“To me, he’s very mod­ern and I hope that this brand of con­fi­dence as a male that Harry has – truly de­void of any traces of toxic mas­culin­ity – is in­dica­tive of his gen­er­a­tion and there­fore the fu­ture of the world,” she said.</p>
    <p>“I think he is in many ways cham­pi­oning that, spear­head­ing that. It’s pretty pow­er­ful and kind of ex­tra­or­di­nary to see some­one in his po­si­tion re­defin­ing what it can mean to be a man with con­fi­dence.”</p>
