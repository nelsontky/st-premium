    <p>Wal­ter Oh loves just how nu­anced the Chi­nese phrase for business is.</p>
    <p>Sheng yi, af­ter all, has in­ti­ma­tions of “birth”, “growth”, “life”, “idea” and “mean­ing”.</p>
    <p>In his case, giv­ing up a promis­ing bank­ing ca­reer to co-found food start-up BoxGreen has been mean­ing­ful and ful­fill­ing in more ways than he had ex­pected.</p>
    <p>What he and co-founder An­drew Lim, 35, con­ceived as a snack sub­scrip­tion ser­vice in 2014 is now a thriv­ing B-corp cer­ti­fied business which uses sus­tain­able pack­ag­ing, spends 60 per cent of its ex­penses with lo­cal sup­pli­ers, gets its snacks packed by ex-of­fend­ers and has an open hir­ing pol­icy, em­ploy­ing for­mer drug ad­dicts, sin­gle moth­ers and peo­ple with spe­cial needs.</p>
    <p>A B-corp business is one which uses business as a force for good.</p>
    <p>The duo came up with the idea when they were man­age­ment as­so­ciates at DBS Bank. Of­ten pulling long hours, they be­moaned the fact that healthy snacks were ei­ther “in­sanely ex­pen­sive” or not eas­ily avail­able and vend­ing ma­chines dis­pensed only “crappy stuff”.</p>
    <p>Mr Oh says: “My idea was, if we could get 1,000 sub­scribers to pay us $20 a month for a box of healthy snacks, we would have it made.”</p>
    <p>The high four-fig­ure salary he was earn­ing then and the cer­tainty of a much big­ger pay cheque in the fu­ture were not easy to give up, but he did not want them to be­come golden hand­cuffs.</p>
    <p>Much to the ire and de­spair of his prop­erty-agent par­ents, he took the plunge. Mr Oh, 33, who has an el­der sis­ter, de­spaired on many oc­ca­sions too – it was a lot of sweat and tears for lit­tle or no salary for the first cou­ple of years. But he also learnt a lot, in­clud­ing how to pitch, raise funds, man­age peo­ple and run a business.</p>
    <p>“It’s been like a six-year MBA,” quips the eco­nom­ics and business grad­u­ate from the Univer­sity of Illi­nois Ur­bana-Cham­paign.</p>
    <p>On sev­eral oc­ca­sions, he thought of throw­ing in the towel. And once, he nearly did, but three aun­ties, whom he had hired as pack­ers, stepped in to save the day. More about that later.</p>
    <p>He says: “Ev­ery­thing we tried to do for profit, the money never comes. But when we do some­thing good, some­thing bet­ter al­ways comes along.”</p>
    <p>A mean­ing­ful business, he says, is one which cares not just about the cus­tomers but also its staff and the world. Hence their motto: Snack Good, Do Good.</p>
    <p>The out­fit – sup­ported by the DBS Foun­da­tion, which helps social en­ter­prises scale up – has ex­panded into Malaysia and raised more than $1 mil­lion in two rounds of fund­ing.</p>
    <p>Turnover has dou­bled year on year for the last four years and crossed $1 mil­lion last year.</p>
    <p>To­day, BoxGreen sup­plies nearly 50 va­ri­eties of snacks – packed at a fa­cil­ity in Changi – as well as cold­pressed juices to more than 500 com­pa­nies and 2,000 homes. It also op­er­ates vend­ing ma­chines. It has a mot­ley crew of more than 20 em­ploy­ees from var­i­ous back­grounds.</p>
    <p>“We’re not out to save the world. But as long as we make some lives bet­ter, we’re happy,” says Mr Oh, who is mar­ried to a bank ex­ec­u­tive and has a three-year-old daugh­ter.</p>
    <p>“Some peo­ple in­ter­pret sheng yi as find­ing mean­ing in life. It’s what</p>
    <p>I’m ex­pe­ri­enc­ing right now. I’m learn­ing about life, both good and bad, and it’s a life­long education.”</p>
    <p>To earn money as an un­der­grad­u­ate, you lit­er­ally wiped some­one’s butt ev­ery day. Tell us why and if butt-wip­ing is char­ac­ter­form­ing?</p>
    <p>I chanced upon a job at the univer­sity as a per­sonal care as­sis­tant (PCA) to a fel­low stu­dent with cere­bral palsy and was in­trigued by the role. It paid rel­a­tively well and I ended up help­ing with his ba­sic daily rou­tines and per­sonal hy­giene.</p>
    <p>Some of the tasks PCAs may per­form for a per­son with dis­abil­i­ties in­clude help­ing them change their clothes, brush their teeth and hair, ex­er­cise and shop. It’s not just butt wip­ing, but a whole lot of other in­ter­ac­tions.</p>
    <p>To be hon­est, I never thought about it much ex­cept that I got to help some­one and earn some­thing on the side. In hind­sight, hav­ing dif­fer­ent ex­pe­ri­ences and per­spec­tives helped me frame my mind­set about life.</p>
    <p>Some may think wip­ing butts is dis­gust­ing, but to me, I would never have met a per­son who is as smart and gen­uine as Pa­trick. We bonded and I learnt a lot, thanks to him. We went to foot­ball games to­gether, made cock­tails in his room and hung out with his friends.</p>
    <p>You and your co-founder had it made work­ing in DBS. So why give it all up to ped­dle nuts?</p>
    <p>A favourite lunchtime dis­cus­sion among my friends was think­ing about what we were go­ing to do in our post-bank­ing ca­reers. Some wanted to go the tra­di­tional route – get an MBA and join a pri­vate equity firm. Oth­ers spoke of start­ing a com­pany or tak­ing time off to travel.</p>
    <p>What­ever it was, the con­sen­sus was to con­tinue to grind away un­til you ac­cu­mu­lated enough money. And that was true – ev­ery year, I got paid a lit­tle more and worked a lit­tle less. The com­fort it pro­vided was ad­dic­tive. I re­alised the golden hand­cuffs are real. I ended up spend­ing more ev­ery year as a way of val­i­dat­ing the time spent in a job I felt I was not cut out for. Ul­ti­mately, I felt bad com­plain­ing about my job but not hav­ing the guts to leave it.</p>
    <p>Over lunch with An­drew one day, we de­cided to act on the idea of de­liv­er­ing healthy snacks. The orig­i­nal do­main name was an­drews nuts.com.</p>
    <p>Did your par­ents threaten to dis­own you?</p>
    <p>They flipped ini­tially, but I be­lieve they al­ways have my best in­ter­ests at heart. Be­ing business own­ers them­selves, they felt the dif­fi­culty and risk of start­ing a business and had their rea­sons to doubt me when we started.</p>
    <p>Snack Good, Do Good. From day one, you wanted to do good?</p>
    <p>I guess so – that’s why we started the “one box, one meal” ini­tia­tive with (char­ity and soup kitchen) Will­ing Hearts, where we do­nate a meal to the needy for ev­ery box of snacks we sell. We don’t just do­nate meals. We also help to cook, pack and de­liver meals at Will­ing Hearts. It’s great for team-build­ing.</p>
    <p>Tell us about the three aun­ties you hired as pack­ers but who even­tu­ally played an in­stru­men­tal role in where you are to­day.</p>
    <p>A few years into the business, we started to won­der if what we were do­ing was sus­tain­able. We were ac­quir­ing cus­tomers in a very ag­gres­sive way – like of­fer­ing a free box for ev­ery two boxes or­dered – but it was neg­a­tive eco­nom­ics.</p>
    <p>There were other prob­lems and we were tired. The three aun­ties have been with us from the be­gin­ning, so I found al­ter­na­tive em­ploy­ment for them at a place which ac­tu­ally paid more. I even took them there. They thought about it, but told me they didn’t want the job.</p>
    <p>The next day, one of them of­fered us some funds to help us set up a proper fa­cil­ity. That was a turn­ing point and al­though our business al­ways had the “do­ing good” el­e­ment, we de­cided it had to fo­cus on a social mis­sion.</p>
    <p>To­day, the three aun­ties are share­hold­ers and also su­per­vi­sors in our pack­ing fa­cil­ity.</p>
    <p>Who or what else has in­spired you to stay the course?</p>
    <p>The peo­ple who have joined the business as em­ploy­ees or part­ners one way or an­other. They have cho­sen to trust us and give us their nine-to-five ev­ery day for the past five years to work on this dream.</p>
    <p>Stub­born­ness, strat­egy, stu­pid­ity or serendip­ity? Which is re­spon­si­ble for BoxGreen’s suc­cess?</p>
    <p>A bet­ter word for stu­pid­ity might be naivete and with that, a mix of serendip­ity. We con­tinue to learn new things (and make mis­takes) ev­ery day and have great peo­ple who be­lieve sell­ing nuts can change the world.</p>
    <p>Do you think you have a mes­siah com­plex? Do you think you’re sav­ing the world?</p>
    <p>Not at all. I don’t claim to know it all... but I do be­lieve I am in con­trol of my ac­tions and they can be used in a force for good.</p>
    <p>Know­ing what you do now, what would you tell Wal­ter Oh in 2014, as he was about to quit his job?</p>
    <p>It is not go­ing to be as smooth-sail­ing as you imag­ined. You can prob­a­bly achieve what you have set out to do in half the time if you learn to let go ear­lier and move on when you re­alise you made a bad de­ci­sion.</p>
    <p>En­tre­pre­neur, hus­band, son: which role is the most dif­fi­cult?</p>
    <p>You missed out fa­ther. I would say fa­ther and son.</p>
    <p>Be­ing a fa­ther helps to put things into per­spec­tive – that you live life only once and time doesn’t turn back. See­ing my daugh­ter grow up is the best thing that has hap­pened in my life. It is also hard­est be­ing a fa­ther be­cause there is guilt that you will never be able to spend enough time with her be­cause of all your other com­mit­ments.</p>
    <p>I re­alise now how much my par­ents have sac­ri­ficed for me to make me who I am, so yes, I am still learn­ing to be a bet­ter fa­ther and son.</p>
