    <p>Thirteen peo­ple, who had been clas­si­fied as im­ported cases when they were con­firmed to have Covid-19 last month, and had served their stay-home no­tice (SHN) at the Man­darin Or­chard Sin­ga­pore ho­tel, may have been in­fected af­ter they ar­rived here.</p>
    <p>The in­ci­dent has re­sulted in all ho­tel guests be­ing pro­gres­sively checked out of Man­darin Or­chard, about 500 staff be­ing tested for Covid-19, and the ho­tel be­ing deep-cleaned and dis­in­fected.</p>
    <p>But ex­perts said the mat­ter is un­likely to spark a wave of in­fec­tions here, given that more than a month has passed since they were con­firmed to have Covid-19. That would have been enough for two in­cu­ba­tion pe­ri­ods of 14 days each.</p>
    <p>The rea­son the 13 peo­ple are sus­pected to have been in­fected here is that they had flown in from 10 dif­fer­ent coun­tries – such as the United States, South Korea, Bri­tain, the Philip­pines and Bahrain – but have been in­fected by coro­n­aviruses that have “high ge­netic sim­i­lar­ity”, im­ply­ing that the in­fec­tions may have come from one source.</p>
    <p>The 13 guests had also all served their SHN in the same tower of the ho­tel be­tween Oct 22 and Nov 11, and were con­firmed to have Covid-19 be­tween Nov 2 and 11.</p>
    <p>In a joint state­ment yes­ter­day, the Min­istry of Health (MOH) and the Sin­ga­pore Tourism Board said: “This sug­gests that th­ese cases were likely in­fected from a sim­i­lar source.”</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore rou­tinely car­ries out genome se­quenc­ing and phy­lo­ge­netic anal­y­sis of the virus – which tracks the fam­ily tree of the virus – from all con­firmed cases. This nor­mally takes about four weeks.</p>
    <p>Once the link be­tween the 13 cases sur­faced, MOH looked deeper into the sit­u­a­tion to see if trans­mis­sion could have oc­curred lo­cally, in­stead of be­fore th­ese peo­ple ar­rived here. The au­thor­i­ties said: “From MOH’s pre­lim­i­nary in­ves­ti­ga­tions, we can­not ex­clude that trans­mis­sions could have oc­curred at Man­darin Or­chard Sin­ga­pore.” Genome se­quenc­ing and anal­y­sis are con­tin­u­ing for cases be­yond Nov 11, they added.</p>
    <p>MOH said it will now test all who are cur­rently serv­ing SHN at the Man­darin Or­chard for Covid-19, in­stead of do­ing the test to­wards the end of their 14 days of SHN. Most have been tested.</p>
    <p>It is also ask­ing all guests who had stayed at the ho­tel since Nov 11 to mon­i­tor their health closely for 14 days from the last date of their stay. They should see a doc­tor if they de­velop symp­toms such as a cough, sore throat, runny nose, fever and loss of taste or smell.</p>
    <p>Al­though peo­ple serv­ing SHN are housed in the 446 rooms on 28 floors of the ho­tel’s Main Tower – seg­re­gated from the other tower called the Or­chard Wing – the ho­tel said it will check ev­ery­one out by to­day as a pre­cau­tion.</p>
    <p>The Man­darin Or­chard in­ci­dent sur­faced even as Prime Min­is­ter Lee Hsien Loong re­cently an­nounced that Sin­ga­pore will fur­ther ease Covid-19 mea­sures from Dec 28, due to the low rate of lo­cal trans­mis­sion. This in­cludes al­low­ing eight peo­ple to dine out to­gether, up from the cur­rent five.</p>
    <p>As­so­ciate Pro­fes­sor Alex Cook of the NUS Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health, who spe­cialises in bio­statis­tics and mod­el­ling, does not think the pos­si­ble spread of the virus at the ho­tel would de­rail this.</p>
    <p>He said: “I’d be sur­prised if there was sub­stan­tial un­de­tected lo­cal spread be­tween then and now.”</p>
    <p>From MOH’s pre­lim­i­nary in­ves­ti­ga­tions, we can­not ex­clude that trans­mis­sions could have oc­curred at Man­darin Or­chard Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>THE MIN­ISTRY OF HEALTH AND THE SIN­GA­PORE TOURISM BOARD, on the dis­cov­ery that the 13 peo­ple were in­fected by coro­n­aviruses that have “high ge­netic sim­i­lar­ity”.</p>
    <p>Stay­ca­tions were cut short at the Man­darin Or­chard Sin­ga­pore, while those on stay-home no­tice (SHN) at the ho­tel were sub­jected to a Covid-19 test yes­ter­day, af­ter the Min­istry of Health (MOH) said it was prob­ing 13 coro­n­avirus cases among peo­ple who had served their SHN there.</p>
    <p>While the ho­tel said all guests would be moved out by to­day, guests with lug­gage were al­ready seen wait­ing at a pick-up point when The Sun­day Times vis­ited at 5pm yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Se­cu­rity staff were on hand to help with bags, and at least two safe dis­tanc­ing am­bas­sadors were spot­ted.</p>
    <p>Most of the guests seen were fam­i­lies with young chil­dren.</p>
    <p>A 37-year-old guest who de­clined to be named said she saw, from a dis­tance, peo­ple in full per­sonal pro­tec­tive equip­ment be­ing ush­ered into a sep­a­rate part of the ho­tel.</p>
    <p>“It’s prob­a­bly just pre­cau­tion­ary mea­sures, but I thought it’s bet­ter to check out one night ear­lier and be safe at home,” she said.</p>
    <p>She was ini­tially booked for a two-night stay with her two daugh­ters, aged nine and seven.</p>
    <p>Fit­ness in­struc­tor Fa­zli Ah­mad, 29, and his wife, who were check­ing out of the ho­tel af­ter a twonight stay, said they will keep a close watch for any pos­si­ble symp­toms over the next two weeks.</p>
    <p>“We came back from swim­ming ear­lier in the af­ter­noon and saw many safe dis­tanc­ing am­bas­sadors in the ho­tel, so we thought maybe there was an event. When we read about the mat­ter on the news, we just started pack­ing,” he said. The cou­ple had their sev­en­month-old daugh­ter with them.</p>
    <p>Other guests de­cided to cut short their stay­ca­tions, too, af­ter read­ing media re­ports.</p>
    <p>Se­nior man­ager Muneer, who wanted to be known only by his first name, said he heard the news when he was shop­ping with his fam­ily in Or­chard Road.</p>
    <p>He de­cided to check out of the ho­tel one night ear­lier as his three­year-old daugh­ter was with him.</p>
    <p>“It’s a lit­tle dis­ap­point­ing be­cause we had plans for din­ner nearby, but now we’re go­ing home. Our mood is af­fected, but safety def­i­nitely comes first,” he said.</p>
    <p>Those serv­ing SHN in the ho­tel were also given a Covid-19 test.</p>
    <p>Pro­ject man­ager Ginny Leow, 51, who com­pleted her SHN yes­ter­day and was sup­posed to check out at noon, said she had her SHN exit swab only af­ter 2pm as the test­ing sta­tions were “quite busy and crowded”.</p>
    <p>“Of course I’m wor­ried be­cause I’ll be stay­ing with rel­a­tives,” said Ms Leow, who lives in Van­cou­ver, Canada, and re­turned to Sin­ga­pore with her 13-year-old son to spend Christ­mas with her fam­ily.</p>
    <p>“To­day is my son’s birth­day so it’s sup­posed to be a happy day, but now we’re feel­ing a bit un­cer­tain,” she said.</p>
    <p>Those still serv­ing their SHN were filled with un­cer­tainty.</p>
    <p>A 35-year-old teacher who wanted to be known only as Ms Kok said: “I am un­sure about whether I should pack my things, so I have just kept half of my be­long­ings. The ho­tel should in­form us about what’s go­ing on, but we also know that some of the staff might not be clear about what’s hap­pen­ing.”</p>
    <p>Af­ter hours with­out news, she re­ceived a call at around 9.15pm, in­form­ing her that she would be trans­ferred to an­other ho­tel to­day.</p>
    <p>Man­darin Or­chard said in a state­ment yes­ter­day that it had no in­for­ma­tion about how long it would be closed as in­ves­ti­ga­tions are still be­ing done.</p>
    <p>It added that re­funds for up­com­ing stays, room and din­ing reser­va­tions, and events will be pro­cessed within 14 days.</p>
    <p>Those in need of as­sis­tance for room book­ings can call 6737-2200. Those with din­ing reser­va­tions can call 6831-6288 or 6831-6271, while those who have booked events can call 6831-6078.</p>
