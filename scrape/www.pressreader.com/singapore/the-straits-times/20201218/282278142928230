    <p>• South Korea cut its growth fore­cast for next year and vowed to con­tinue to sup­port work­ers and ex­porters as a resur­gence of the coro­n­avirus de­layed its re­cov­ery and forced the gov­ern­ment to keep its fis­cal taps wide open.</p>
    <p>Gross do­mes­tic prod­uct is ex­pected to grow 3.2 per cent next year, the Fi­nance Min­istry said yes­ter­day, down from a pre­vi­ous es­ti­mate of 3.6 per cent, as the coun­try faces a third wave of coro­n­avirus in­fec­tions.</p>
    <p>Boom­ing ex­ports will help the econ­omy re­cover from an ex­pected slump of 1.1 per cent this year, which would be the big­gest full-year fall since 1998.</p>
    <p>“To achieve our first pri­or­ity – fast and strong re­cov­ery and a re­turn to a vi­brant econ­omy – we will keep macro poli­cies ex­pan­sion­ary as we did this year,” ViceFi­nance Min­is­ter Kim Yong-beom said at a news con­fer­ence.</p>
    <p>“The un­cer­tainty over the coro­n­avirus spread will re­strict our path to re­cov­ery in ser­vice sec­tors where busi­ness mod­els are based around hu­man con­tact, and across con­sump­tion and em­ploy­ment.”</p>
    <p>The gov­ern­ment plans to spend 63 per cent of its record 558 tril­lion won (S$676 bil­lion) an­nual fis­cal bud­get in the first half of next year to shore up growth and boost tax ben­e­fits for credit card spend­ing that ex­ceeds a cer­tain amount, the min­istry said.</p>
    <p>A 110 tril­lion won in­vest­ment project pro­gramme will di­rect gov­ern­ment spend­ing to pub­lic hous­ing, rail­roads and har­bours, and aim to keep busi­nesses afloat and se­cure jobs. Mean­while, more than 255 tril­lion won worth of fi­nanc­ing will be made avail­able for ex­porters through cheap loans.</p>
    <p>Ex­ports are likely to jump 8.6 per cent next year, thanks to grow­ing global de­mand for mem­ory chips af­ter a 6.2 per cent slump this year, the min­istry said.</p>
    <p>The lat­est out­look and spend­ing plans are based on the as­sump­tion that South Korea can avoid a fullscale lock­down, which the health au­thor­i­ties on Wed­nes­day said they are con­sid­er­ing amid a record surge in coro­n­avirus cases.</p>
    <p>The Fi­nance Min­istry also said it would mon­i­tor how lo­cal bro­ker­ages and in­sur­ance com­pa­nies get dol­lar fi­nanc­ing to avoid any sharp changes in cap­i­tal flows into and out of the econ­omy.</p>
