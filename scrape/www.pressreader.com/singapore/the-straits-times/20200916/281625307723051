    <p>Ja­pan’s in­com­ing Prime Min­is­ter Yoshi­hide Suga yes­ter­day ap­peared set to con­tinue his pre­de­ces­sor Shinzo Abe’s poli­cies, as he is likely to keep key Cab­i­net min­is­ters and party of­fi­cials in their posts. But ques­tions re­main on some ar­eas of Abe­nomics.</p>
    <p>In­com­ing Ja­panese prime min­is­ter Yoshi­hide Suga has said he will con­tinue the path set by his pre­de­ces­sor Shinzo Abe, while dis­man­tling in­ef­fi­cien­cies in gov­ern­ment.</p>
    <p>Here is a look at some of his pol­icy pledges.</p>
    <p>DIG­I­TAL AGENCY</p>
    <p>The Covid-19 pan­demic ex­posed the in­ef­fi­cien­cies of work­ing with fax ma­chines and reg­is­tered seals ( inkan), and Mr Suga has vowed to undo the na­tion’s no­to­ri­ety for be­ing a pa­per­heavy bu­reau­cracy.</p>
    <p>The new dig­i­tal agency, which will be led by a dig­i­tal min­is­ter, a new Cab­i­net post, will also pro­mote fields such as telemedici­ne and online learn­ing.</p>
    <p>It will also build a frame­work to en­able Ja­pan res­i­dents to ac­cess gov­ern­ment ser­vices round the clock with the “My Num­ber” iden­ti­fi­ca­tion sys­tem.</p>
    <p>RE­DUC­ING BU­REAU­CRACY</p>
    <p>Ja­panese min­istries – many of them over­sized – tend to work in si­los, in­stead of the so-called “whole-of-gov­ern­ment” ap­proach.</p>
    <p>This has led to fric­tion be­tween min­istries dur­ing the Covid-19 pan­demic in a source of frus­tra­tion for Mr Abe.</p>
    <p>The Health Min­istry was overly cau­tious on ex­pand­ing testing, while the Nikkei re­ported that it had prob­lems work­ing with the Econ­omy and Trade Min­istry to get more med­i­cal sup­plies; the Ed­u­ca­tion Min­istry to en­gage univer­sity hos­pi­tals; and the In­ter­nal Af­fairs Min­istry to li­aise with lo­cal mu­nic­i­pal­i­ties.</p>
    <p>CUT­TING MO­BILE RATES</p>
    <p>In 2018, Mr Suga suc­ceeded in get­ting mo­bile car­ri­ers to cut fees by as much as 40 per cent. He wants them re­duced even more, es­pe­cially for large-vol­ume users, and to slash rates when switch­ing tel­cos.</p>
    <p>RE­GIONAL BANKS</p>
    <p>There are 64 re­gional banks dot­ted across Ja­pan, many of them bleed­ing dry, given the dwin­dling clien­tele due to the dwin­dling pop­u­la­tion.</p>
    <p>Mr Suga had said that there were “too many” re­gional banks, call­ing for con­sol­i­da­tion in a view backed by the Fi­nan­cial Ser­vices Agency.</p>
