    <p>The pan­demic shut down the­atres world­wide. And it drove arts com­pa­nies to dig­i­tal plat­forms in un­prece­dented num­bers.</p>
    <p>For a heady few months, cul­ture vul­tures got drunk on the over­dose of fab­u­lous of­fer­ings, all ac­ces­si­ble from home and for free.</p>
    <p>It was a smor­gas­bord rang­ing from the­atri­cal block­busters to in­die of­fer­ings. One could watch So­phie Okonedo and Ralph Fi­ennes fac­ing off as An­thony and Cleopa­tra in the Na­tional Theatre’s 2018 pro­duc­tion or tune in to Si­mon McBur­ney’s as­ton­ish­ing one-man show The En­counter, which had the per­fect au­dio de­sign for home view­ing.</p>
    <p>Closer to home, lo­cal theatre groups also opened up their archives.</p>
    <p>The Nec­es­sary Stage, the only theatre group to put up a full ar­chive on­line, shared some land­mark shows for free, and tried payper-view for its sold-out Fringe Fes­ti­val hit, Ke­baya Homies.</p>
    <p>Nine Years Theatre, Pangde­mo­nium and The Theatre Prac­tice were among other theatre groups which put up archival pro­grammes.</p>
    <p>It was not just the theatre com­pa­nies which shared their riches.</p>
    <p>The renowned Mari­in­sky Bal­let pro­grammed the sel­dom-seen The Bronze Horse­man, the Met­ro­pol­i­tan Opera put its live broad­cast record­ings on weekly ro­ta­tion and the Sin­ga­pore Chi­nese Orches­tra or­gan­ised a host of short pro­grammes recorded from mu­si­cians’ homes.</p>
    <p>There is no re­plac­ing the vibe of a live per­for­mance, of course. But the gen­er­ous ar­ray of dig­i­tal of­fer­ings helped keep peo­ple sane as the pan­demic raged and they were stuck at home.</p>
    <p>Theatre­go­ers here were also re­minded of what they had taken for granted as the arts scene has blos­somed in re­cent decades – the lux­u­ri­ous chance to cherry-pick the var­ied of­fer­ings ev­ery week­end for en­ter­tain­ing nights out on the town.</p>
    <p>Now that the­atres have re­opened to lim­ited live au­di­ences, it is time to sup­port the per­for­mances in real life.</p>
    <p>The wind­fall of free con­tent is a re­minder that artists work hard at what they do and they, too, need a fair wage for their ef­forts.</p>
