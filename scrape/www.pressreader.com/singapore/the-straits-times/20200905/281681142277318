    <p>Sin­ga­pore­ans must keep their re­solve, pre­pare them­selves for the longer term and look ahead to emerg­ing as a stronger so­ci­ety even as they deal with the Covid-19 cri­sis, Na­tional De­vel­op­ment Min­is­ter Des­mond Lee said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Now is the time to reimag­ine new in­dus­tries and mar­kets for Sin­ga­pore, and learn new skills and dis­cover new ca­reers, he added.</p>
    <p>The na­tion is still in the midst of an un­fold­ing cri­sis, Mr Lee said, and the Gov­ern­ment’s im­me­di­ate fo­cus is to nav­i­gate Sin­ga­pore through the pan­demic and the se­ri­ous eco­nomic down­turn.</p>
    <p>How­ever, like some MPs have said in the course of the five-day de­bate, there is also a need to think longer term and po­si­tion the coun­try for a strong re­cov­ery, he added.</p>
    <p>Mr Lee said: “We can­not sim­ply hun­ker down and wait for things to get bet­ter. In­stead, we must pre­pare our­selves now so that we can cap­ture new op­por­tu­ni­ties when they come.”</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore and Sin­ga­pore­ans are not start­ing from scratch, he added, but are build­ing on strong pil­lars and steady im­prove­ments over the years.</p>
    <p>Mr Lee, who is also Min­is­ter-in­charge of So­cial Ser­vices In­te­gra­tion, was speak­ing in Par­lia­ment on the fi­nal day of the de­bate on the Pres­i­dent’s Ad­dress.</p>
    <p>He said that in the last 10 years, Sin­ga­pore has in­vested heav­ily in early child­hood and con­tin­u­ing adult ed­u­ca­tion, and en­hanced health­care and so­cial ser­vice ar­chi­tec­ture.</p>
    <p>In­dus­try trans­for­ma­tion maps have also been im­ple­mented to strengthen dif­fer­ent eco­nomic sec­tors, he added. “These fun­da­men­tals stand us in good stead to nav­i­gate the winds of change con­fronting us,” he said.</p>
    <p>He cited the ex­am­ple of the hard­hit con­struc­tion sec­tor, which was dealt a very heavy blow when com­pa­nies had to put projects on hold for months dur­ing the out­break in work­ers’ dor­mi­to­ries.</p>
    <p>He said: “Even af­ter work­ers were cleared, it has not been easy to restart. Many changes were needed to en­sure work­ers were safe, and de­spite sig­nif­i­cant gov­ern­ment sup­port, many con­struc­tion firms and work­ers con­tinue to suf­fer badly.”</p>
    <p>But this ex­pe­ri­ence has strength­ened the Gov­ern­ment’s re­solve to trans­form the con­struc­tion sec­tor when the Covid-19 sit­u­a­tion sta­bilises, he added.</p>
    <p>Mr Lee said: “We have to drive dig­i­tal­i­sa­tion, adopt more ad­vanced build­ing tech­nol­ogy to en­hance pro­duc­tiv­ity and through this trans­for­ma­tion, try to at­tract more Sin­ga­pore­ans to join this sec­tor.”</p>
    <p>Such a push will re­quire the col­lec­tive ef­forts of firms, work­ers and the Gov­ern­ment, he added.</p>
    <p>In his speech, Mr Lee said he was heart­ened to hear a broad range of top­ics brought up by MPs in the last few days, with the new Par­lia­ment re­flect­ing Sin­ga­pore’s di­ver­sity.</p>
    <p>The top­ics in­cluded the chal­lenges faced by en­ter­prises and work­ers, as well as the im­por­tance of build­ing a strong Sin­ga­porean core while re­main­ing open to for­eign tal­ent to com­ple­ment the work­force, he added.</p>
    <p>New MPs Poh Li San (Sem­bawang GRC) and Raeesah Khan (Sengkang GRC) spoke about is­sues fac­ing youth and women, while Xie Yao Quan (Jurong GRC) and Yip Hon Weng (Yio Chu Kang) of­fered sug­ges­tions on how more can be done to im­prove se­nior care.</p>
    <p>Mr Lee said: “Our democ­racy is ma­tur­ing. We have seen and will con­tinue to see a greater con­tes­ta­tion of views and ideas in Par­lia­ment, in civil so­ci­ety and in on­line dis­course.</p>
    <p>“We will dif­fer on how best to take things for­ward for Sin­ga­pore. But, as PM Lee em­pha­sised, we can­not af­ford to al­low a di­ver­sity in views to lead to dis­trust or po­lar­i­sa­tion.”</p>
