    <p>Social gath­er­ings were banned un­der cir­cuit breaker rules to curb the spread of Covid-19. The ban con­tin­ued in phase one of the eco­nomic re­open­ing, but was eased with phase two on June 19. Here is a look at how the rules have changed:</p>
    <p>CIR­CUIT BREAKER: APRIL 7 TILL JUNE 1</p>
    <p>All social gath­er­ings – such as pri­vate par­ties and social get-to­geth­ers with friends, family mem­bers and rel­a­tives not within the same house­hold – were pro­hib­ited.</p>
    <p>Gath­er­ings at home, pub­lic spa­ces such as Hous­ing Board void decks and parks were also banned.</p>
    <p>An in­di­vid­ual was al­lowed to visit an­other per­son’s home un­der only three sit­u­a­tions: de­liv­er­ing es­sen­tial goods or ser­vices, pro­vid­ing help to a se­nior ci­ti­zen or a per­son with dis­abil­ity, and seek­ing or ren­der­ing help in an emergency.</p>
    <p>PHASE ONE: JUNE 2 TO 18</p>
    <p>Social gath­er­ings and non-es­sen­tial ac­tiv­i­ties were still banned.</p>
    <p>But the rules were eased slightly to al­low people to visit their par­ents or grand­par­ents liv­ing else­where. Each house­hold could re­ceive up to only two vis­i­tors – who must live to­gether in an­other house – once a day.</p>
    <p>PHASE TWO: JUNE 19 TILL THE PRESENT</p>
    <p>Rules were fur­ther re­laxed to al­low small group gath­er­ings of up to five people. Each house­hold may re­ceive up to five vis­i­tors per day.</p>
    <p>This meant that groups of up to five people can also meet out­side of homes, such as at restau­rants for meals. But they should prac­tise safe dis­tanc­ing and avoid mix­ing be­tween dif­fer­ent groups.</p>
