    <p>The com­pul­sory na­tional health in­sur­ance scheme, MediShield Life, is set for a sig­nif­i­cant re­vamp next year, with wider ben­e­fits be­ing pro­posed so that it can cover more and larger hospi­tal bills. The pro­posal in­cludes rais­ing the yearly claim limit un­der the scheme from $100,000 to $150,000. But to pay for these ben­e­fits and ris­ing health­care costs, pre­mi­ums are ex­pected to go up next year by as much as 35 per cent. This will be the first in­crease in MediShield Life pre­mi­ums since the scheme was launched five years ago. The change can be ex­pected to elicit mixed re­sponses, with Sin­ga­pore­ans wel­com­ing the ex­panded ben­e­fits, but some wor­ried about the fi­nan­cial bur­den of higher pre­mi­ums. It is good there­fore that the au­thor­i­ties are seek­ing peo­ple’s views on the pre­lim­i­nary rec­om­men­da­tions. Sin­ga­pore­ans from all walks of life should take this op­por­tu­nity to give their feed­back and sug­ges­tions so that the fi­nal shape of the pro­posal can be fine-tuned where nec­es­sary.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore­ans should nev­er­the­less also take heart from two fea­tures of the re­vamp. First, up to 50 per cent of MediShield Life pre­mi­ums will con­tinue to be sub­sidised for about half the pop­u­la­tion, in ad­di­tion to the sub­si­dies that the Pi­o­neer and Merdeka gen­er­a­tions re­ceive. These are per­ma­nent pre­mium sub­si­dies that pro­vide help to a sub­stan­tial num­ber in the pop­u­la­tion. Ad­di­tion­ally, the Govern­ment will give two years of</p>
    <p>Covid-19 sub­si­dies to Sin­ga­pore­ans to re­duce the bur­den of pre­mium hikes. Given how the coro­n­avirus pan­demic has cut a deadly eco­nomic swathe through lives, these mea­sures pro­vide an im­por­tant mea­sure of fi­nan­cial help to Sin­ga­pore­ans. Sec­ond, there is the note­wor­thy pro­posal to in­clude in­sur­ance cov­er­age of treat­ment for drug ad­dic­tion, al­co­holism and in­juries aris­ing from at­tempted sui­cide or de­lib­er­ate self-harm un­der MediShield Life. This is an im­por­tant move be­cause it will pro­vide es­sen­tial sup­port to pa­tients who stand in need of treat­ment and re­duce the stigma against seek­ing help. The psy­cho­log­i­cal di­men­sion is cru­cial. Ad­dic­tion and self-harm are dif­fi­cult to ad­dress if they are seen as ex­am­ples of un­de­sir­able so­cial be­hav­iour and not med­i­cal con­di­tions that can be treated. The evolving ap­proach to these con­di­tions, re­flected in the pro­posal, would go quite some way in bring­ing suc­cour to those af­fected and to their fam­i­lies.</p>
    <p>The larger point in the pro­posal is the con­tin­u­ing need to keep MediShield Life sus­tain­able. It would not be an ex­ag­ger­a­tion to sug­gest that the scheme has be­come an in­te­gral part of ci­ti­zens’ wel­fare, much as life in Sin­ga­pore can­not be un­der­stood without the HDB and the CPF. How­ever, ris­ing health­care costs, par­tic­u­larly in an age­ing so­ci­ety, con­sti­tute a fi­nan­cial threat that must be faced up to. Re­fin­ing MediShield Life to keep it fea­si­ble is an im­per­a­tive.</p>
