    <p>Like Fo­rum con­trib­u­tor</p>
    <p>Ray­mond Koh Bock Swi, I also re­tired from the bank­ing in­dus­try, after some 40 years (Work­force com­po­si­tion in banks needs to be ex­am­ined, Aug 15).</p>
    <p>And some of the prac­tices in the sec­tor, while un­der­stand­able, are dis­con­cert­ing. For in­stance, over the past two decades, many banks have been out­sourc­ing their back-of­fice op­er­a­tions to de­vel­op­ing coun­tries in the pur­suit of cost sav­ings.</p>
    <p>The flip side of this move is that ba­sic un­der­stand­ing and fun­da­men­tal bank­ing skills are lost among the younger gen­er­a­tion of bank em­ploy­ees.</p>
    <p>This means Sin­ga­pore will even­tu­ally be de­pen­dent on other coun­tries to func­tion as a fi­nan­cial cen­tre, and any dis­rup­tion in those coun­tries will di­rectly af­fect the daily op­er­a­tions of banks here.</p>
    <p>Those back-of­fice jobs could have been per­formed by our polytech­nic grad­u­ates, al­low­ing them to build their ca­reers from there.</p>
    <p>On­shoring these crit­i­cal func­tions would give banks better con­trol of the bank­ing trans­ac­tions over­all, and even help them spot and stop fraud­u­lent trans­ac­tions.</p>
    <p>For ex­am­ple, bills of lad­ing – lists giv­ing de­tails of the goods that a ship is car­ry­ing – are al­ways is­sued on se­cu­rity paper, and trained per­son­nel can de­tect a gen­uine one from a fake one just by look­ing at and feel­ing it.</p>
    <p>Once the op­er­a­tion is out­sourced, how­ever, the em­ployee con­cerned would no longer be able to tell the dif­fer­ence through his com­puter screen or faxed copies.</p>
    <p>The other im­me­di­ate ben­e­fit is job cre­ation. These back-of­fice jobs would pro­vide greater value-add to the econ­omy than gig econ­omy jobs like food de­liv­ery and pri­vate-hire driv­ing.</p>
    <p>My other ob­ser­va­tion is that nowa­days, banks pre­fer to em­ploy staff on a short-term con­trac­tual ba­sis.</p>
    <p>The banks cite lim­ited head­count as the ra­tio­nale. Not only would these short-term staff not feel a sense of be­long­ing, but they would also find it dif­fi­cult to plan their ca­reers.</p>
    <p>These trends are not con­ducive to de­vel­op­ing Sin­ga­pore’s pre­cious man­power re­source.</p>
