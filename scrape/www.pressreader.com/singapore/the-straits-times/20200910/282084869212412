    <p>Three men worked to­gether to rob a Malaysian man of $365,000 af­ter dup­ing him into be­liev­ing that they had bit­coins to sell.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to court doc­u­ments, Jaromel Gee Ming Li, 29, and Mohd Ab­dul Rah­man Mo­hamad, 39, hatched the plan in April 2018.</p>
    <p>The pros­e­cu­tors said that Ab­dul Rah­man later roped in Syed Mokhtar Syed Yu­sope, who was tasked to rob, in­tim­i­date and as­sault the vic­tim.</p>
    <p>Mokhtar, a 39-year-old Sin­ga­porean, pleaded guilty in a dis­trict court yes­ter­day to a rob­bery charge. The cases in­volv­ing the other two Sin­ga­pore­ans are still pend­ing.</p>
    <p>Deputy Pub­lic Pros­e­cu­tors Chin Jincheng, Chong Yong and Au­drey Choo stated in court doc­u­ments that Gee was in­volved in bit­coin bro­ker­age at the time.</p>
    <p>Pre­sent­ing him­self as a seller, he would ar­range trans­ac­tions be­tween par­ties who wished to buy and sell bit­coins.</p>
    <p>Gee also en­gaged Ab­dul Rah­man to help him with the trans­ac­tions, the court heard. The pros­e­cu­tors said that in April 2018, the pair planned to rob prospec­tive buy­ers with­out trans­fer­ring or sell­ing any bit­coins to them.</p>
    <p>On April 8, 2018, Malaysian Pang Joon Hau ar­rived at a Ho­tel 81 branch i n Mid­dle Road as he wanted to buy bit­coins from sell­ers in Sin­ga­pore and he had cash to­talling $365,000 in his pos­ses­sion.</p>
    <p>The pros­e­cu­tors said that Gee later found out about Mr Pang’s in­ten­tion from a con­tact and alerted Ab­dul Rah­man, telling him to get an ad­di­tional per­son to com­mit the rob­bery.</p>
    <p>The DPPs added that Ab­dul Rah­man then con­tacted Mokhtar. Ab­dul Rah­man and Mokhtar went to the ho­tel at around 11pm.</p>
    <p>The pros­e­cu­tors said the pair and a bit­coin bro­ker, Mr Lee Chee Kwok, went to Mr Pang’s room, and Mokhtar asked the vic­tim where the money was.</p>
    <p>The DPPs added: “Pang showed the money to Mokhtar, and Mokhtar pro­ceeded to punch Pang once on the left cheek. Lee at­tempted to in­ter­vene, but Mokhtar punched him.”</p>
    <p>Ab­dul Rah­man then grabbed a back­pack con­tain­ing the $365,000 be­fore leav­ing the room with Mokhtar, the court heard.</p>
    <p>The DPPs said that Mokhtar re­ceived $10,000 as a re­ward and he de­posited $5,000 into his bank ac­count. He was ar­rested at the Wood­lands Check­point on April 9, 2018 and of­fi­cers seized a bag con­tain­ing $5,000 from him.</p>
    <p>Court doc­u­ments did not state if the au­thor­i­ties man­aged to re­cover the re­main­ing monies from the trio. Mokhtar is out on bail of $30,000 and will be sen­tenced to­mor­row.</p>
