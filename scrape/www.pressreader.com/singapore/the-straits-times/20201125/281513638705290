    <p>More than 12,000 jobs are on of­fer in the in­fo­comm tech­nol­ogy (ICT) sec­tor here, with the bulk of them for pro­fes­sion­als, man­agers, ex­ec­u­tives and tech­ni­cians.</p>
    <p>The roles in­clude man­age­ment po­si­tions and busi­ness con­sul­tants, with monthly salaries rang­ing be­tween $5,250 and $7,500.</p>
    <p>About 7,190 job seek­ers were also ear­lier placed into jobs, trainee­ships and train­ing po­si­tions in the ICT sec­tor be­tween April and early this month.</p>
    <p>This makes ICT, by far, the sec­tor with the high­est num­ber of place­ments un­der the SGUnited Jobs and Skills Pack­age, said Man­power Min­is­ter Josephine Teo.</p>
    <p>More than 12,000 jobs are on of­fer in the in­fo­comm tech­nol­ogy (ICT) sec­tor, with the bulk of them – about 95 per cent – for pro­fes­sion­als, man­agers, ex­ec­u­tives and tech­ni­cians (PMETs).</p>
    <p>This is af­ter about 7,190 job seek­ers were ear­lier placed in jobs, trainee­ships and train­ing po­si­tions in the ICT sec­tor be­tween April and early this month, said the Min­istry of Man­power (MOM) and the In­fo­comm Me­dia De­vel­op­ment Author­ity (IMDA) in a jobs sit­u­a­tion re­port yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>About 2,160 of them found jobs, with 85 per cent of these in PMET roles. Another 5,030 peo­ple were en­rolled in at­tach­ment, trainee­ship and train­ing op­por­tu­ni­ties.</p>
    <p>This makes ICT, by far, the sec­tor with the high­est num­ber of place­ments un­der the SGUnited Jobs and Skills Pack­age, said Man­power Min­is­ter Josephine Teo at a me­dia con­fer­ence.</p>
    <p>ICT PMET jobs in­clude man­age­ment and busi­ness con­sul­tant roles, with monthly salaries rang­ing from $5,250 to $7,500, with a me­dian monthly pay of $6,500.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, the salaries for soft­ware, Web and mul­ti­me­dia de­vel­op­ers range from $4,500 to $7,500 a month, with a me­dian of $6,000.</p>
    <p>Sales, mar­ket­ing and busi­ness de­vel­op­ment man­agers can earn be­tween $3,800 and $7,500, with a me­dian of $5,500.</p>
    <p>Of­ten, there is a mis­con­cep­tion that en­ter­ing the sec­tor re­quires deep in­dus­try knowl­edge, said Mrs Teo. How­ever, some 30 per cent of the job open­ings are in “tech-lite” roles, which may be suit­able for ap­pli­cants with­out ICT back­ground or ex­pe­ri­ence.</p>
    <p>Tech-lite roles in­clude cus­tomer suc­cess man­agers, dig­i­tal mar­ket­ing spe­cial­ists and pre-sales con­sul­tants. These roles may ap­peal more to mid-ca­reer in­di­vid­u­als who are look­ing to switch ca­reers into ICT, said MOM and IMDA.</p>
    <p>There is strong de­mand for man­power in func­tions such as dig­i­tal mar­ket­ing, soft­ware en­gi­neer­ing and cy­ber se­cu­rity, as well as for lead­ers to drive dig­i­tal trans­for­ma­tion across busi­nesses, the agen­cies added.</p>
    <p>To meet this grow­ing de­mand, the work­force has to be reskilled and trans­formed.</p>
    <p>Since 2015, more l ocals have taken up jobs in the ICT sec­tor. Lo­cal em­ploy­ment has ex­panded by 17,000, form­ing 71 per cent of the sec­tor’s to­tal em­ploy­ment of 190,200, said MOM and IMDA, adding that this does not yet in­clude the growth for ICT per­son­nel in other sec­tors of the econ­omy.</p>
    <p>To help lo­cals ac­cess op­por­tu­ni­ties in this sec­tor, the Gov­ern­ment and the in­dus­try have adopted a three-pronged ap­proach.</p>
    <p>One way is by rolling out place­and-train pro­grammes for new hires and reskilling of ex­ist­ing staff. Over the next three years, at least 5,500 job place­ment op­por­tu­ni­ties with firms will be de­vel­oped.</p>
    <p>Another ap­proach is to of­fer com­pany-hosted trainee­ships and at­tach­ments, par­tic­u­larly for those who may not have rel­e­vant ex­pe­ri­ence. Cur­rently, there are 4,900 such op­por­tu­ni­ties avail­able.</p>
    <p>In ad­di­tion, ef­forts have been made across in­sti­tutes of higher learn­ing (IHL) to nur­ture and main­tain a steadily grow­ing tal­ent pipe­line. In­take into ICT cour­ses and clus­ters at IHLs has grown by about 17 per cent over the last three years, with an in­take of around 7,600 alone for the 2020 aca­demic year.</p>
    <p>The on­go­ing Covid-19 pan­demic has ac­cel­er­ated the adop­tion of dig­i­tal tech­nolo­gies, lead­ing to the cre­ation of new roles and more man­power de­mand in ICT.</p>
    <p>Some com­pa­nies saw it as an op­por­tu­nity to hire and train staff as they shift to­wards growth ar­eas. Oth­ers will be of­fer­ing more train­ing op­por­tu­ni­ties for job seek­ers.</p>
    <p>Mrs Teo said: “The ICT sec­tor will con­tinue to grow, and we will con­tinue with ef­forts to build up the pipe­line of tal­ent to meet this de­mand, guide job seek­ers into jobs, and pro­vide ca­reer guid­ance to ex­ist­ing work­ers in this sec­tor.”</p>
