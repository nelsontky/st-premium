    <p>Aries (March 21 - April 19)</p>
    <p>Take care of your rep­u­ta­tion. It could be as sim­ple as be­ing a sweet­heart or as com­plex as mount­ing a full-scale pub­lic re­la­tions of­fen­sive.</p>
    <p>Taurus (April 20 - May 20)</p>
    <p>At least one per­son knows what he or she is talk­ing about and he or she may have more wis­dom than you had hoped. It is a good time to seek ad­vice.</p>
    <p>Gemini (May 21 - June 20)</p>
    <p>You can­not quite tell what peo­ple re­ally mean – are they se­ri­ous or just try­ing to gauge your re­ac­tion? Try harder to ask big ques­tions and get good an­swers.</p>
    <p>Can­cer (June 21 - July 22)</p>
    <p>Your eyes open to some­thing to­tally new – maybe the dark side of a re­la­tion­ship or spir­i­tual truth that has never oc­curred to you be­fore.</p>
    <p>Leo (July 23 - Aug 22)</p>
    <p>You are the only one who can ren­der help. Some­one needs you badly and you may have to toss your plans out the win­dow as you come to the res­cue.</p>
    <p>Virgo (Aug 23 - Sept 22)</p>
    <p>If you are feel­ing lonely, now is the per­fect time to meet some­one new. Your en­ergy is just right for mak­ing con­nec­tions out­side your net­work.</p>
    <p>Libra (Sept 23 - Oct 22)</p>
    <p>Your emo­tions are out of sorts, but that does not mean you can­not get your job done or take care of your fam­ily. See if you can get your friends to hear you out.</p>
    <p>Scorpio (Oct 23 - Nov 21)</p>
    <p>You should be able to get along well with al­most any­one at work or from your past. That in­cludes ex­act­ing bosses and bossy exes, so check in with ev­ery­one.</p>
    <p>Sagittariu­s (Nov 22 - Dec 21)</p>
    <p>Seek the best deal. You have to fig­ure out some way to have money left over at the end of the month, as things are sure to be tight then.</p>
    <p>Capricorn (Dec 22 - Jan 19)</p>
    <p>You need to make a splash and, with your en­ergy, it is hard to see how you could keep your­self from do­ing so. It is a good time to go for an in­ter­view or date.</p>
    <p>Aquarius (Jan 20 - Feb 18)</p>
    <p>You are in a tense sit­u­a­tion, but you do not have any idea what is go­ing on or why. Do not be stressed out. You are smart enough to find a so­lu­tion.</p>
    <p>Pisces (Feb 19 - March 20)</p>
    <p>Some­thing does not feel right. You may not know where you are go­ing or what is needed, but your gift for ex­per­i­men­ta­tion should suf­fice. • Pro­vided by Astrology.com (www.astrology.com)</p>
