    <p>US Pres­i­dent-elect Joe Biden in­tro­duced re­tired gen­eral Lloyd Austin as his pick for Sec­re­tary of De­fence on Wed­nes­day, while re­spond­ing to crit­i­cism that his choice would erode a norm meant to en­sure civil­ian con­trol of the mil­i­tary and that Mr Austin might not pay suf­fi­cient at­ten­tion to the Asia-Pa­cific.</p>
    <p>Mr Austin, who re­tired from the mil­i­tary more than four years ago, will re­quire a waiver from Congress to be con­firmed. Un­der US law, a for­mer mil­i­tary of­fi­cer must have been out of uni­form for at least seven years be­fore be­com­ing de­fence chief.</p>
    <p>Mr Biden said: “There are good rea­sons for this law that I fully un­der­stand and re­spect, and I would not be ask­ing for an ex­cep­tion here if I did not be­lieve this mo­ment in our his­tory didn’t call for it – and if I didn’t have the faith I do in Lloyd Austin to ask for it.”</p>
    <p>The Pres­i­dent-elect had high praise for Mr Austin, who headed the US Cen­tral Com­mand un­der for­mer pres­i­dent Barack Obama from 2013 to 2016, and over­saw the with­drawal of 150,000 Amer­i­can troops from Iraq.</p>
    <p>If con­firmed, Mr Austin would be the first African Amer­i­can to head the De­fence Depart­ment, in line with Mr Biden’s goal to bring greater di­ver­sity to his Cabi­net.</p>
    <p>Mr Biden and Mr Austin also stressed that the re­tired gen­eral val­ued Amer­ica’s al­lies, in­clud­ing those in the Asia-Pa­cific.</p>
    <p>Their com­ments came after some con­ster­na­tion over a com­men­tary penned by Mr Biden in The At­lantic on Tues­day in sup­port of Mr Austin, which failed to men­tion the re­gion en­tirely.</p>
    <p>Mr Austin said: “I un­der­stand the im­por­tant role the depart­ment plays in main­tain­ing sta­bil­ity, de­ter­ring ag­gres­sion, and de­fend­ing and sup­port­ing crit­i­cal al­liances around the world, in­clud­ing in the Asia-Pa­cific.”</p>
    <p>He also promised to come into the role as a civil­ian leader with a deep ap­pre­ci­a­tion and rev­er­ence for the pre­vail­ing wis­dom of civil­ian con­trol of the mil­i­tary.</p>
    <p>“I recog­nise that be­ing a mem­ber of the pres­i­dent’s Cabi­net re­quires a dif­fer­ent per­spec­tive and unique re­spon­si­bil­i­ties from a ca­reer in uni­form. I in­tend to keep this at the fore­front of my mind,” he said.</p>
    <p>The waiver has been granted only in 1950, for Gen­eral Ge­orge Mar­shall, and in 2017, for re­tired gen­eral James Mat­tis, who had been out of uni­form for four years at that point.</p>
    <p>News of Mr Austin’s nom­i­na­tion was greeted with some dis­com­fort among sev­eral law­mak­ers.</p>
    <p>Michi­gan’s Demo­crat con­gress­woman Elissa Slotkin is ap­pre­hen­sive about hav­ing “another re­cently re­tired gen­eral to serve in a role de­signed for a civil­ian”.</p>
    <p>“After the last four years, civil-mil­i­tary re­la­tions at the Pen­tagon def­i­nitely need to be re­bal­anced... I’ll need to un­der­stand what he (Mr Austin) and the Biden ad­min­is­tra­tion plan to do to ad­dress these con­cerns be­fore I can vote for his waiver,” she said, echo­ing a sen­ti­ment shared by other Democrats.</p>
    <p>Mr Biden’s im­pend­ing nom­i­na­tion of Demo­crat trade lawyer and China ex­pert Kather­ine Tai as his trade czar – re­ported by ma­jor US news out­lets on Wed­nes­day night – was a less con­tentious choice.</p>
    <p>The pick sig­nals that con­fronting China over its trade prac­tices will con­tinue to be a pri­or­ity of his ad­min­is­tra­tion, as it was un­der out­go­ing Pres­i­dent Donald Trump’s.</p>
    <p>Ms Tai has re­ceived broad sup­port from both mod­er­ates and lib­er­als, and trade ex­perts and law­mak­ers wel­comed the news.</p>
    <p>Ms Tai, who is chief trade coun­sel on the House Ways and Means Com­mit­tee, speaks flu­ent Man­darin, and has deep ex­per­tise and ex­pe­ri­ence in in­ter­na­tional trade.</p>
    <p>As chief coun­sel for China trade en­force­ment at the Of­fice of the US Trade Rep­re­sen­ta­tive from 2011 to 2014, Ms Tai was re­spon­si­ble for the devel­op­ment and lit­i­ga­tion of Amer­ica’s dis­putes against China at the World Trade Or­gan­i­sa­tion.</p>
    <p>She also worked on the US-Mex­ico-Canada Agree­ment ne­go­ti­ated by the Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion.</p>
    <p>Ms Tai, 45, is Mr Biden’s first Asian Amer­i­can Cabi­net-level ap­point­ment. If con­firmed by the Se­nate, she would be the first mi­nor­ity woman to serve as US Trade Rep­re­sen­ta­tive.</p>
    <p>Demo­crat se­na­tor Sher­rod Brown of Ohio called her the most qual­i­fied can­di­date for the post.</p>
    <p>Mr John Mur­phy, se­nior vi­cepres­i­dent for in­ter­na­tional pol­icy at the US Cham­ber of Com­merce, said: “Her deep pol­icy back­ground and her suc­cess build­ing bridges in Congress will serve her well in the role.”</p>
    <p>In com­ments ear­lier this year, Ms Tai said US trade pol­icy re­gard­ing China had to be strate­gic and not just “de­fen­sive”.</p>
    <p>“The of­fence has got to be about what we are go­ing to do to make our­selves... be able to com­pete stronger, and ul­ti­mately be able to de­fend this open demo­cratic way of life that we have,” she said.</p>
