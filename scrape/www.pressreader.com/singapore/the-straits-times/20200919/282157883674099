    <p>It is good to see how hawk­ers are mov­ing to­wards dig­i­tal­i­sa­tion with hawker cen­tres and cof­fee shops in my neigh­bour­hood of­fer­ing cash­less pay­ment op­tions such as through the Sin­ga­pore Quick Re­sponse Code (SGQR) (Gov­ern­ment will sup­port hawk­ers through their dig­i­tal­i­sa­tion jour­ney: Iswaran, ST On­line, June 11).</p>
    <p>How­ever, the ac­tual ex­pe­ri­ence has been less than smooth as I have en­coun­tered ob­sta­cles in com­plet­ing trans­ac­tions via SGQR.</p>
    <p>On one oc­ca­sion, the ven­dor told me the point-of-sale ter­mi­nal by Nets had been down for sev­eral days and no one had fixed it.</p>
    <p>On an­other, the app re­turned an er­ror mes­sage say­ing that the mer­chant had not set up the QR code prop­erly. Both times, the stall­hold­ers were not able to re­solve the tech­ni­cal is­sues and just shrugged their shoul­ders.</p>
    <p>SGQR should not be just an­other pay­ment op­tion but rather the de facto pay­ment mode as we move to­wards full dig­i­tal­i­sa­tion. The cur­rent Covid-19 sit­u­a­tion makes this even more ur­gent as such a sys­tem also helps to min­imise con­tact be­tween cus­tomers and busi­ness own­ers.</p>
    <p>My ex­pe­ri­ence with SGQR shows we still have some way to go in ed­u­cat­ing ven­dors and the public on the tremen­dous po­ten­tial of this e-pay­ment mode.</p>
    <p>I hope the rel­e­vant au­thor­i­ties will ad­dress this to en­sure con­sumers have a seam­less ex­pe­ri­ence and ven­dors get the knowl­edge to re­solve teething is­sues. This is some­thing our dig­i­tal am­bas­sadors should take note of.</p>
