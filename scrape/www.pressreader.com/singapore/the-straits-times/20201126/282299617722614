    <p>HELP­ING GEN­UINE BUY­ERS</p>
    <p>A key player in the prop­erty sec­tor has joined calls to al­low gen­uine first-time Hous­ing Board flat own­ers up­grad­ing to a pri­vate condo to de­fer pay­ment of the ad­di­tional buyer’s stamp duty (ABSD).</p>
    <p>UOL chief ex­ec­u­tive Liam Wee Sin told a brief­ing yes­ter­day: “It is our hope that the Gov­ern­ment will grant ABSD re­mis­sion – sim­i­lar to EC (ex­ec­u­tive con­do­minium) buy­ers – giv­ing them time to sell their HDB home six months af­ter col­lect­ing their keys.”</p>
    <p>He said de­mand for the pri­vate res­i­den­tial mar­ket is gen­uine, and sub­stan­tially from HDB up­graders, who have higher as­pi­ra­tions of liv­ing in a condo.</p>
    <p>“It makes log­i­cal sense to pro­mot­ing the as­pi­ra­tions of Sin­ga­pore­ans,” added Mr Liam, who was speak­ing at the launch of UOL’s lat­est res­i­den­tial project.</p>
    <p>“A tweak to this ABSD pol­icy to align with what is al­ready in place for EC buy­ers can help gen­uine HDB up­graders to transition to a pri­vate prop­erty.”</p>
    <p>A HDB owner must now pay a 12 per cent ABSD within 14 days of sign­ing the sale and pur­chase agree­ment for a pri­vate prop­erty if he has not al­ready sold his ex­ist­ing home.</p>
    <p>“The 12 per cent is a sub­stan­tial amount to pay,” said Mr Liam.</p>
    <p>Re­mis­sion would mean up­graders would not face the pres­sure of hav­ing to pay this within 14 days of sign­ing the sale and pur­chase agree­ment.</p>
    <p>Mr Liam wants the Gov­ern­ment to con­sider al­low­ing such buy­ers the same ABSD re­mis­sion en­joyed by HDB up­graders pur­chas­ing ECs, a public-pri­vate hy­brid.</p>
    <p>These buy­ers get six months to sell their HDB flats af­ter get­ting the keys to their new EC home.</p>
    <p>Mr Liam said giv­ing up­graders mov­ing into the pri­vate mar­ket six months to sell their HDB flat is “log­i­cal on many as­pects”.</p>
    <p>“Be­sides eas­ing their cash flow, this also ad­dresses other con­sid­er­a­tions that buy­ers have to con­tend with, such as the lo­gis­tics of find­ing an in­terim ac­com­mo­da­tion, while still wait­ing for the new pri­vate prop­erty to be com­pleted.”</p>
    <p>Mr Liam’s call echoes one made by the Real Es­tate Devel­op­ers’ As­so­ci­a­tion of Sin­ga­pore in Septem­ber, which urged the Gov­ern­ment to ur­gently con­sider al­low­ing first­time HDB up­graders to de­fer pay­ment of the ABSD un­til six months af­ter the com­ple­tion of the pri­vate prop­erty.</p>
    <p>At the brief­ing, UOL also ap­peared quite op­ti­mistic about sell­ing its new project as prices are “re­al­is­tic and af­ford­able”, said Mr Liam.</p>
    <p>The 640-unit Clavon in Cle­menti Av­enue 1 fea­tures flex­i­ble spa­ces, smart-home ameni­ties and tech­nol­ogy so­lu­tions.</p>
    <p>Pric­ing at the two 37-storey tow­ers starts from $1,475 per sq ft.</p>
    <p>Com­pa­ra­ble project Parc Clema­tis has a me­dian unit price of $1,634 per sq ft, while Kent Ridge Hill Res­i­dences’ me­dian unit price was $1,770 per sq ft for the Jan­uary-to-Oc­to­ber pe­riod, noted Ms Chris­tine Sun, OrangeTee & Tie’s head of re­search and con­sul­tancy.</p>
    <p>Clavon – an 80:20 joint ven­ture be­tween UOL and sub­sidiary United In­dus­trial Cor­po­ra­tion – com­prises one- to five-bed­room units rang­ing from 527 sq ft to 1,690 sq ft. There are 356 one- or two-bed­ders sized from 527 sq ft to 764 sq ft.</p>
    <p>More than half of the 640-unit de­vel­op­ment is priced be­low $1.5 mil­lion. A one-bed­room starts from $800,000, a two-bed­der from $1 mil­lion, a three-bed­room unit from $1.45 mil­lion, a four-bed­room unit from $1.9 mil­lion and a five-bed­room home from $2.5 mil­lion.</p>
    <p>Mr Liam said the mar­ket for new pri­vate homes is sta­ble.</p>
    <p>There were 8,021 new units sold in the year to Oc­to­ber, with Mr Liam es­ti­mat­ing that 9,000 to 10,000 units will be moved over the full year, com­pared with 9,912 last year.</p>
    <p>It makes log­i­cal sense to pro­mot­ing the as­pi­ra­tions of Sin­ga­pore­ans. A tweak to this ABSD pol­icy to align with what is al­ready in place for EC buy­ers can help gen­uine HDB up­graders to transition to a pri­vate prop­erty. ’’</p>
