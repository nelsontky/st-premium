    <p>BEI­JING • China has be­gun an an­tidump­ing probe into im­ports of Aus­tralian wine, a move that knocked a fifth off the mar­ket value of Aus­tralia’s big­gest wine­maker and is likely to worsen ten­sion be­tween the na­tions.</p>
    <p>The in­ves­ti­ga­tion by China’s com­merce min­istry will look at im­ports of wine from Aus­tralia in con­tain­ers of two litres or less last year, the min­istry said yes­ter­day in a state­ment, and ex­am­ine any dam­age to the do­mes­tic wine in­dus­try from 2015 to 2019.</p>
    <p>The Chi­nese Al­co­holic Drinks As­so­ci­a­tion re­quested the in­quiry, ask­ing the reg­u­la­tor to look into 10 Aus­tralian wine pro­duc­ers, in­clud­ing Trea­sury Wine Es­tates, the maker of Pen­folds, and Ac­co­lade wines.</p>
    <p>Shares of Trea­sury, the world’s big­gest stand­alone wine­maker, fell up to 20 per cent on wor­ries at the prospect of an im­port tax on Aus­tralian wine. In a state­ment, the com­pany said it re­mained com­mit­ted to China as a “pri­or­ity mar­ket”.</p>
    <p>The in­ves­ti­ga­tion comes against a back­drop of ris­ing ten­sion be­tween the two coun­tries after Can­berra called for an in­ter­na­tional in­quiry into the ori­gins of the coro­n­avirus.</p>
    <p>China is the top mar­ket for Aus­tralian wine ex­ports and is also Aus­tralia’s largest trad­ing part­ner, with two-way trade worth A$235 bil­lion (S$232 bil­lion) last year.</p>
    <p>China will carry out the in­ves­ti­ga­tion in a “fair and just way, ac­cord­ing to the law”, for­eign min­istry spokesman Zhao Li­jian said, re­ject­ing sug­ges­tions that it was po­lit­i­cally mo­ti­vated.</p>
    <p>Bei­jing re­cently im­posed dumping tar­iffs on Aus­tralian bar­ley, sus­pended some beef im­ports and told Chi­nese stu­dents and tourists it was not safe to travel to Aus­tralia be­cause of ac­cu­sa­tions of racism.</p>
    <p>Aus­tralia’s Trade Min­is­ter Simon Birm­ing­ham called the in­ves­ti­ga­tion “very dis­ap­point­ing and per­plex­ing”, and said China was also con­sid­er­ing a re­quest to in­ves­ti­gate coun­ter­vail­ing du­ties, an im­port tax im­posed to pre­vent dumping or counter export sub­si­dies.</p>
    <p>He told reporters he had not spo­ken with his Chi­nese coun­ter­part or other se­nior gov­ern­ment of­fi­cials since May, when he re­quested talks in the light of the bar­ley tar­iff.</p>
