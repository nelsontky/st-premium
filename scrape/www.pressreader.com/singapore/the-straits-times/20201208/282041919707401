    <p>MS JU­LIANA DAWOOD, WHO UP­GRADED HER­SELF VIA SKILLSFUTU­RE FOR HER NEW JOB.</p>
    <p>Ms Ju­liana Dawood had been work­ing at an ed­u­ca­tion en­ter­prise as an executive as­sis­tant for less than three months when she lost her job on Jan 13.</p>
    <p>Ten days later, Sin­ga­pore saw its first case of Covid-19.</p>
    <p>While un­em­ployed, Ms Dawood, who is sin­gle, heard about the Gov­ern­ment’s move to pro­vide Sin­ga­pore­ans with ad­di­tional SkillsFutu­re credit, and thought it would be a good time to check out some cour­ses.</p>
    <p>The 36-year-old had used some of her SkillsFutu­re open­ing credit of $500 to take a Mi­crosoft Ex­cel course be­fore she lost her job.</p>
    <p>When she learnt that the Gov­ern­ment was go­ing to top up her SkillsFutu­re ac­count with an­other $500, she con­tacted NTUC Learn­ing Hub.</p>
    <p>She was told she could tap the top-up amount in ad­vance of its roll out in Oc­to­ber.</p>
    <p>In May, she took a business an­a­lyt­ics course with data an­a­lyt­ics plat­form Qlik Sense, and com­pleted 11 more cour­ses in the fol­low­ing three months.</p>
    <p>The course fees, which were sub­sidised, ranged from about $20 to just over $100 each, adding up to a to­tal of $453.15.</p>
    <p>Among the slew of cour­ses she took was project man­age­ment for all, pro­vided by NTUC Learn­ing Hub.</p>
    <p>Ms Dawood, who has a de­gree in business man­age­ment from the Univer­sity of Green­wich in Bri­tain, said: “One of the jobs I ap­plied for re­quired a project man­age­ment cer­ti­fi­ca­tion, and the project man­age­ment for all course gave me a leg up.”</p>
    <p>She is now work­ing as a court reporter man­ager at Opus 2, which digi­tises le­gal pro­ceed­ings such as tran­scrip­tion, vir­tual hear­ings, and elec­tronic pre­sen­ta­tion ev­i­dence. Her role is to man­age a di­ary for free­lance court reporters and match their soft­ware skills to dif­fer­ent types of ser­vices and plat­forms.</p>
    <p>Said Ms Dawood: “This job is en</p>
    <p>WILL­ING TO LEARN</p>
    <p>I was keen to chal­lenge my­self and branch out into a dif­fer­ent sec­tor. Mid-ca­reer change is not so scary if you are will­ing to learn and be flex­i­ble.’’</p>
    <p>MS JU­LIANA DAWOOD, (above).</p>
    <p>tirely dif­fer­ent from my pre­vi­ous ex­pe­ri­ences as I had never be­fore worked in a le­gal tech sec­tor, nor was I fa­mil­iar with the soft­ware or plat­form used.”</p>
    <p>She added: “I was keen to chal­lenge my­self and branch out into a dif­fer­ent sec­tor.”</p>
    <p>She also said that her 14 years of work ex­pe­ri­ence made it eas­ier for her to adapt.</p>
    <p>“Mid-ca­reer change is not so scary if you are will­ing to learn and be flex­i­ble.”</p>
