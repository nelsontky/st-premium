    <p>NEW YORK • The de­ci­sion in the past week by the Dan­ish gov­ern­ment to kill mil­lions of minks due to coro­n­avirus con­cerns, ef­fec­tively wip­ing out a ma­jor national in­dus­try, has spot­lighted wor­ries among sci­en­tists and con­ser­va­tion­ists about the vul­ner­a­bil­ity of an­i­mals to the virus and what in­fec­tions among an­i­mals could mean for hu­mans.</p>
    <p>The most dis­turb­ing pos­si­bil­ity is the virus mu­tat­ing in an­i­mals and be­com­ing more trans­mis­si­ble or dan­ger­ous to hu­mans.</p>
    <p>In Den­mark, the virus has shifted from hu­mans to minks and back to hu­mans, and has mu­tated in the process.</p>
    <p>Minks are the only an­i­mals known to have passed the coro­n­avirus to hu­mans, ex­cept for the ini­tial spillover event from an un­known species.</p>
    <p>Other an­i­mals, like cats and dogs, have been in­fected by ex­po­sure to hu­mans, but there are no known cases of peo­ple be­ing in­fected by ex­po­sure to their pets.</p>
    <p>The ver­sions of the virus that have mu­tated in minks and spread to hu­mans are not more trans­mis­si­ble or caus­ing more se­vere ill­ness in hu­mans. But one of the vari­ants, found in 12 peo­ple so far, was less re­spon­sive to an­ti­bod­ies in lab tests.</p>
    <p>The Dan­ish health au­thor­i­ties wor­ried that the ef­fec­tive­ness of vac­cines in de­vel­op­ment might be di­min­ished for this vari­ant and took all pos­si­ble mea­sures to stop its spread.</p>
    <p>This in­cluded killing all of the coun­try’s minks and ef­fec­tively lock­ing down the north­ern part of the coun­try, where the mu­tated</p>
    <p>virus was found.</p>
    <p>The World Health Or­gan­i­sa­tion and in­ter­na­tional sci­en­tists said they have yet to see ev­i­dence that this vari­ant will af­fect vac­cines.</p>
    <p>Be­sides minks, dogs, cats and ge­net­i­cally en­gi­neered mice have also been in­fected with Covid-19.</p>
    <p>Dogs and cats seem to suf­fer few ill ef­fects. The other an­i­mals have ex­hib­ited vary­ing re­sponses.</p>
    <p>Farmed minks, how­ever, have died in large num­bers in Europe and in the United States, partly be­cause of the crowded con­di­tions on those ranches, which could in­crease the amount of ex­po­sure.</p>
    <p>Pub­lic health ex­perts worry that any species ca­pa­ble of in­fec­tion could be­come a reser­voir for the virus to re-emerge, and likely mu­tate, at any time and in­fect peo­ple.</p>
    <p>Con­ser­va­tion ex­perts also worry about the ef­fect on an­i­mal species that are al­ready in trou­ble.</p>
    <p>One ap­proach to study­ing sus­cep­ti­bil­ity is to look at an­i­mal genomes and see which ones have a se­quence that codes for a pro­tein on cells which al­lows the virus to latch on.</p>
    <p>Dr Kate Sawatzki, the an­i­mal surveil­lance co­or­di­na­tor for a test­ing project in pets and other an­i­mals at the Cum­mings School of Ve­teri­nary Medicine at Tufts Univer­sity, said 282 wildlife sam­ples from 22 species have been tested.</p>
    <p>“(They are) pri­mar­ily bats in New Eng­land re­ha­bil­i­ta­tion fa­cil­i­ties, and we are happy to re­port that none has been pos­i­tive.”</p>
    <p>She said they have also tested 538 do­mes­tic pets, some from house­holds with peo­ple with Covid-19, and none has shown signs of ac­tive virus.</p>
    <p>Dr Sawatzki said the lab also con­ducted blood tests for an­ti­bod­ies, which showed that pets seemed to be get­ting in­fected but not get­ting sick or pass­ing the virus on.</p>
    <p>So far, the minks in Den­mark are the only known in­stance of the virus in­fect­ing an an­i­mal, mu­tat­ing and trans­fer­ring back to hu­mans.</p>
