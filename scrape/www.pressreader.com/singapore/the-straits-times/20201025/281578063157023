    <p>Malaysian Cabi­net min­is­ters yes­ter­day de­fended their de­ci­sion to seek emer­gency pow­ers on Fri­day, amid crit­i­cism from the op­po­si­tion and civil so­ci­ety over what some are call­ing an un­demo­cratic move by the Muhyid­din ad­min­is­tra­tion to stay in power.</p>
    <p>In a post­ing on Twit­ter late on Fri­day, Fed­eral Ter­ri­to­ries Min­is­ter An­nuar Musa asked what other le­gal pro­vi­sion would al­low elec­tions in Malaysia to be de­layed amid a resur­gent wave of coron­avirus in­fec­tions.</p>
    <p>He was shar­ing a lo­cal me­dia re­port cit­ing lawyers as say­ing that ex­ist­ing leg­is­la­tion is suf­fi­cient to deal with the Covid-19 out­break.</p>
    <p>He claimed the ma­jor­ity of Malaysians do not want to go to the bal­lot, hav­ing seen how last month’s polls in Sabah trig­gered record num­bers of daily in­fec­tions and deaths.</p>
    <p>A by-elec­tion in Batu Sapi, Sabah, is sched­uled for Dec 5, and state polls must be held in neigh­bour­ing Sarawak by the mid­dle of next year.</p>
    <p>The Umno law­maker asked in his tweet which law to use when Batu Sapi vot­ers want the gov­ern­ment to post­pone the by-elec­tion.</p>
    <p>He added: “Which law to use when Sarawakian­s want their PRN (state elec­tion) to be post­poned for fear of what hap­pened to Sabah. And which law to use when 87 per cent of vot­ers in­di­cated they don’t want GE for fear of Covid-19 out­break.” It was un­clear where he ob­tained the fig­ure on the per­cent­age of vot­ers who want to avoid a gen­eral elec­tion.</p>
    <p>Tan Sri An­nuar added in a Face­book post that “var­i­ous par­ties are threat­en­ing to top­ple the Prime Min­is­ter through the Par­lia­ment sit­ting next month”.</p>
    <p>“If that hap­pens, the PM can dis­solve Par­lia­ment and a gen­eral elec­tion must be held,” he said.</p>
    <p>“What would be the out­come if in the next two, three months, we pri­ori­tise po­lit­i­cal power strug­gles in the name of democ­racy... al­low­ing elec­tions ev­ery­where, sur­ren­der­ing the lives of the pub­lic to fate.”</p>
    <p>Malaysia’s na­tional polls are not due un­til 2023. But a po­lit­i­cal im­broglio, trig­gered when Op­po­si­tion Leader An­war Ibrahim claimed he had a “for­mi­da­ble ma­jor­ity” last month, has raised the spec­tre that Bud­get 2021, to be tabled in Par­lia</p>
    <p>(From far left) Sul­tan Ab­dul­lah Ah­mad Shah and Prime Min­is­ter Muhyid­din Yassin in a video posted on Re­gent of Pa­hang Tengku Has­sanal Ibrahim’s (in blue) In­sta­gram sto­ries on Fri­day. ment on Nov 6, would be de­feated when a vote is taken.</p>
    <p>Prime Min­is­ter Muhyid­din Yassin had 113 MPs back­ing him in the 222-seat House, but there are ques­tions over whether he still has that ma­jor­ity be­hind him.</p>
    <p>Tan Sri Muhyid­din’s Perikatan Na­sional gov­ern­ment could lose a vote in Par­lia­ment if just three out of its 113 MPs de­fect.</p>
    <p>Should the gov­ern­ment fail to ap­prove spend­ing for next year, Mr Muhyid­din would have to re­sign, pos­si­bly trig­ger­ing snap polls as no other MP ap­pears to be able to com­mand a par­lia­men­tary ma­jor­ity.</p>
    <p>An emer­gency would al­low Par­lia­ment and elec­tions to be sus­pended, while laws and ex­pen­di­ture can be ap­proved di­rectly by the gov­ern­ment.</p>
    <p>In a state­ment yes­ter­day, Se­nior Min­is­ter for Econ­omy Azmin Ali ac­cused Datuk Seri An­war of stir­ring up in­sta­bil­ity with “out­right lies and sub­terfuge” by claim­ing a par­lia­men­tary ma­jor­ity. He added that the op­po­si­tion’s ac­cu­sa­tions “about the na­tion de­scend­ing into dic­ta­tor­ship should a state of eco­nomic emer­gency be de­clared is there­fore an act of ut­ter reck­less­ness”.</p>
    <p>“Let us be clear. Our real en­emy is Covid-19 (but) op­po­si­tion lead­ers have again cho­sen in­stead to sow fear and re­sent­ment amongst the peo­ple against the gov­ern­ment’s earnest ef­forts at se­cur­ing pub­lic health and safety while en­sur­ing eco­nomic re­cov­ery,” Datuk Seri Azmin said.</p>
    <p>Th­ese state­ments were the first pub­lic com­ments made by Cabi­net min­is­ters on the need for an emer­gency since the spe­cial Cabi­net meet­ing de­cided on the mat­ter on Fri­day morn­ing.</p>
    <p>Malaysia’s na­tional palace said yes­ter­day that the King, Sul­tan Ab­dul­lah Ah­mad Shah, will con­sult eight other state mon­archs as soon as pos­si­ble be­fore mak­ing a de­ci­sion.</p>
