    <p>TOKYO • United States Pres­i­dent Donald Trump has paid his “high­est re­spect” to Ja­panese Prime Min­is­ter Shinzo Abe, who re­signed due to de­te­ri­o­rat­ing health last Friday.</p>
    <p>Call­ing Mr Abe a very great friend, Mr Trump said on board Air Force One af­ter an elec­tion cam­paign rally: “We’ve had a great re­la­tion­ship and I just feel very badly about it, be­cause it must be very se­vere for him to leave.</p>
    <p>“He loves his coun­try so much and for him to leave, you know, I just can’t imag­ine what it is. He’s a great gen­tle­man and so I’m just pay­ing my high­est re­spect.”</p>
    <p>The two lead­ers have en­joyed a close re­la­tion­ship since Mr Abe, on a charm of­fen­sive to win over a mer­cu­rial leader, broke diplo­matic pro­to­col to meet the then Pres­i­dent-elect in Novem­ber 2016.</p>
    <p>Since then, they have played golf at least five times and en­gaged in fre­quent phone calls and face-to­face sum­mits.</p>
    <p>Mr Abe, 65, quit af­ter a flare-up of ul­cer­a­tive col­i­tis, a chronic in­flam­ma­tory bowel dis­ease that he feared would hin­der gov­er­nance.</p>
    <p>Ja­panese me­dia said he was due to speak to Mr Trump by phone to­mor­row, in what will be their first call in three months.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump’s op­po­nent at the US pres­i­den­tial elec­tion in Novem­ber, Demo­cratic can­di­date Joe Bi­den, also said he was grate­ful for Mr Abe’s “friend­ship and lead­er­ship”.</p>
    <p>“I’m sad to see you step down, but I know the strong al­liance be­tween our coun­tries and peo­ples will con­tinue for gen­er­a­tions to come,” he wrote on Twit­ter.</p>
    <p>China also sent its well wishes yes­ter­day to Mr Abe, who was lauded for mak­ing “im­por­tant ef­forts” to re­store bi­lat­eral ties and put them on the right track.</p>
    <p>“The two heads of state have reached an im­por­tant con­sen­sus on build­ing a bi­lat­eral re­la­tion­ship in keep­ing with the de­mand of a new era,” said Chi­nese for­eign min­istry spokesman Zhao Li­jian.</p>
    <p>“We ap­pre­ci­ate PM Shinzo Abe’s im­por­tant ef­forts in im­ple­ment­ing the con­sen­sus and wish him an early re­cov­ery.”</p>
    <p>Bei­jing added that it will con­tinue to work with Tokyo to deepen an­tipan­demic, eco­nomic and so­cial de­vel­op­ment co­op­er­a­tion.</p>
    <p>Bi­lat­eral ties have, how­ever, been com­pli­cated of late by China’s mil­i­tary as­sertive­ness in the East and South China seas and over is­sues such as Hong Kong.</p>
    <p>Ja­pan has said it was watch­ing these de­vel­op­ments with con­cern and no date has been fixed yet for a de­layed state visit by Chi­nese Pres­i­dent Xi Jin­ping amid calls for it to be can­celled al­to­gether.</p>
    <p>Plau­dits also con­tin­ued to pour in from else­where.</p>
    <p>A spokesman for United Na­tions sec­re­tary-gen­eral An­to­nio Guter­res saluted Mr Abe for a dis­tin­guished ca­reer, dur­ing which there had been “con­sis­tent and con­struc­tive en­gage­ment with the UN to ad­dress global chal­lenges”.</p>
    <p>Cana­dian Prime Min­is­ter Justin Trudeau thanked Mr Abe for ded­i­cat­ing his years to build­ing a bet­ter world, and for the vi­sion, lead­er­ship and friend­ship that had fos­tered bi­lat­eral ties.</p>
    <p>New Zealand Prime Min­is­ter Jacinda Ardern called Mr Abe a per­son of great in­tegrity who had “led by ex­am­ple and showed what hard work, pas­sion and care for oth­ers can achieve”.</p>
    <p>She added: “There is much Ja­pan and New Zealand see eye to eye on. Our shared com­mit­ment to democ­racy and the rules-based in­ter­na­tional sys­tem makes Ja­pan an im­por­tant part­ner for New Zealand, es­pe­cially in the Indo-Pa­cific re­gion where we share com­mon goals.”</p>
