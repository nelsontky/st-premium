    <p>Just as he came out of a work meet­ing last Fri­day, Tampines Rovers fan Pang Jia Tai re­ceived the per­fect news to start the weekend – the Sin­ga­pore Premier League (SPL) will fi­nally be back after more than half a year.</p>
    <p>The long-awaited news that the SPL, which has been sus­pended since March 24 ow­ing to the coro­n­avirus pan­demic, would re­turn to­mor­row was an­nounced by Min­is­ter for Cul­ture, Com­mu­nity and Youth Ed­win Tong.</p>
    <p>Pang, an en­gi­neer, said: “My week­ends have been too bor­ing, so when the news broke, I was jump­ing for joy.”</p>
    <p>For months, the Stags fan of 18 years was re­fresh­ing his so­cial me­dia pages in hopes that there would be news of the SPL’s re­sump­tion.</p>
    <p>With­out lo­cal football, the 28-year-old, who also sup­ports English gi­ants Ar­se­nal, has been tun­ing into the English Premier League and watch­ing Tampines’ old games on YouTube.</p>
    <p>But fans may have to wait a lit­tle longer be­fore they re­turn to the stands as games will be played be­hind closed doors when the SPL kicks off.</p>
    <p>Al­birex Ni­igata fan James Per­reira Gavin, a fa­cil­i­ties main­te­nance tech­ni­cian, ex­pected this but was still ex­cited by the re­turn of the league and will be fol­low­ing the live-streamed matches on­line.</p>
    <p>The 42-year-old said: “I’m look­ing for­ward to the SPL restart, but it won’t be the same be­cause it will be be­hind closed doors.”</p>
    <p>How­ever, oth­ers like Pang are ea­ger to sup­port their teams in the flesh and are plan­ning to find a van­tage point out­side the sta­di­ums’ premises to cheer their teams on while ob­serv­ing safe dis­tanc­ing mea­sures.</p>
    <p>“We miss ev­ery­thing (about the match-day ex­pe­ri­ence), from go­ing to the sta­dium to watch the games to say­ing ‘hi’ to the play­ers,” said Pang, who is a part of the club’s un­of­fi­cial fan group, Yel­low Knights.</p>
    <p>Gey­lang In­ter­na­tional fan Nas Mar­juki is plan­ning to catch the broad­cast with other fans, not­ing that he would abide by the Covid-19 pre­cau­tion­ary mea­sures.</p>
    <p>For the past few months, the con­struc­tion safety man­ager and his fel­low Gey­lang fans from the club’s un­of­fi­cial fan group Ul­tras Ea­gles have rem­i­nisced about past games by shar­ing pre­vi­ous games’ high­lights in their What­sApp chat group.</p>
    <p>“It was re­ally awe­some news and we get to see our favourite teams in ac­tion again,” said the 35-year-old, who has been sup­port­ing Gey­lang for five years.</p>
    <p>“It’s never hap­pened be­fore – to have a sea­son halted – so it was all up in the air and we just wanted clo­sure.”</p>
    <p>With Tampines at the top of the ta­ble with nine points from four matches – three more than Gey­lang who have a game in hand – Pang hopes that the Stags, who fin­ished sec­ond be­hind Brunei DPMM last sea­son, can get a shot at the ti­tle this time.</p>
    <p>He added: “But the most im­por­tant thing is that ev­ery­one is safe.”</p>
