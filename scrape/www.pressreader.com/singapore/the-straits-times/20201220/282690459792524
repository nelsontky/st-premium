    <p>A With the Covid-19 pan­demic up­end­ing in­dus­tries and the job mar­ket, it is nat­u­ral to won­der if there is a safe route your child can take to join the work­force af­ter grad­u­a­tion.</p>
    <p>As your daugh­ter will grad­u­ate three or four years from now, it is hard to say with cer­tainty what skills and knowl­edge will be in de­mand then.</p>
    <p>Also, no job is ever 100 per cent re­ces­sion-proof. And re­ces­sions with dif­fer­ent causes im­pact sec­tors dif­fer­ently.</p>
    <p>But there are gen­er­ally some jobs or in­dus­tries which are seen as more es­sen­tial re­gard­less of the state of the econ­omy, for in­stance, med­i­cal pro­fes­sion­als and ed­u­ca­tors.</p>
    <p>We can look at re­cent labour mar­ket data for some in­di­ca­tion of cur­rent trends and skills that are still in de­mand.</p>
    <p>The Min­istry of Man­power’s (MOM) quar­terly labour mar­ket re­ports in­di­cate de­mand in terms of job open­ings.</p>
    <p>Some sec­tors have stayed rel­a­tively re­silient to the pan­demic, es­pe­cially those deemed es­sen­tial ser­vices or where re­mote work is more fea­si­ble.</p>
    <p>In the sec­ond quar­ter of the year from April to June – which co­in­cided with the cir­cuit breaker pe­riod – the sec­tors that saw the least im­pact in terms of labour mar­ket out­comes were elec­tron­ics man­u­fac­tur­ing, in­for­ma­tion and com­mu­ni­ca­tions, public ad­min­is­tra­tion and education, health and social ser­vices, and fi­nan­cial and in­surance ser­vices.</p>
    <p>The hard­est-hit sec­tors in the same quar­ter were man­u­fac­tur­ing, con­struc­tion, whole­sale and re­tail trade, ac­com­mo­da­tion and food ser­vices, and arts, en­ter­tain­ment and recre­ation.</p>
    <p>In the third quar­ter from July to Septem­ber, the big­gest growth in em­ploy­ment was seen in public ad­min­is­tra­tion and education, food and bev­er­age ser­vices, health and social ser­vices, in­for­ma­tion and com­mu­ni­ca­tions, and in­surance ser­vices.</p>
    <p>In the same pe­riod, the sec­tors that lost the most work­ers were con­struc­tion, man­u­fac­tur­ing, arts, en­ter­tain­ment and recre­ation, trans­porta­tion and stor­age, and ad</p>
    <p>min­is­tra­tive and sup­port ser­vices.</p>
    <p>MOM’s weekly jobs sit­u­a­tion re­ports have also high­lighted in­dus­tries where there is still de­mand for work­ers amid the cur­rent eco­nomic slump, un­der the SGUnited Jobs and Skills Pack­age.</p>
    <p>Th­ese in­clude health­care, which as at the end of last month, had about 1,530 va­can­cies for long-term</p>
    <p>jobs for health­care pro­fes­sion­als and ex­ec­u­tives, such as fi­nance and hu­man re­sources ex­ec­u­tives, nurses and al­lied health pro­fes­sion­als.</p>
    <p>There were also 5,480 long-term jobs avail­able in the pro­fes­sional ser­vices sec­tor as at end-Oc­to­ber.</p>
    <p>In in­fo­comm tech­nol­ogy, there were more than 12,000 job open­ings as at early last month. About 95 per cent of th­ese were for pro­fes­sional, man­ager, ex­ec­u­tive and tech­ni­cian roles, such as soft­ware, Web and mul­ti­me­dia de­vel­op­ers, net­work en­gi­neers and man­age­ment and business con­sul­tants.</p>
    <p>The labour mar­ket re­ports and jobs sit­u­a­tion re­ports can be found on MOM’s web­site.</p>
    <p>Com­ing back to your daugh­ter, her in­ter­ests should play a part in the course she chooses. Be­ing a univer­sity stu­dent is not just about ac­quir­ing new knowl­edge and skills but also learn­ing about one­self.</p>
    <p>And she will need to be mo­ti­vated to com­plete the course and find work in the field.</p>
    <p>If your daugh­ter is in­ter­ested in a gen­eral sci­ence or arts de­gree and you are wor­ried about her not hav­ing enough tech­ni­cal skills, one op­tion is to ap­ply for a dou­ble ma­jor or dou­ble de­gree pro­gramme.</p>
    <p>Dou­ble ma­jor com­bi­na­tions can range from eco­nomics and media an­a­lyt­ics to psy­chol­ogy and tech­nol­ogy for business.</p>
    <p>In an age of tech­no­log­i­cal dis­rup­tion and in­creased data avail­abil­ity, tech­ni­cal skills are of­ten seen as be­ing key to mar­ket­ing one­self.</p>
    <p>Still, Am­bas­sador-at-Large Tommy Koh made the case for a hu­man­i­ties education in a speech he de­liv­ered at a 2018 sym­po­sium, say­ing that amid the fourth in­dus­trial rev­o­lu­tion, “we want our hu­man­ists to un­der­stand tech­nol­ogy and our tech­nol­o­gists to un­der­stand the hu­man­i­ties”.</p>
