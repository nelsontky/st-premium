    <p>BEIRUT • Riot po­lice fired tear gas at demon­stra­tors try­ing to break through a bar­rier to get to the Par­lia­ment build­ing in Beirut yesterday dur­ing a protest over the gov­ern­ment’s han­dling of last week’s dev­as­tat­ing ex­plo­sion in the city.</p>
    <p>About 5,000 peo­ple gath­ered in Mar­tyrs’ Square in the city cen­tre, some throw­ing stones. The po­lice fired tear gas when some protesters tried to break through the bar­rier block­ing a street lead­ing to Par­lia­ment, a Reuters jour­nal­ist said.</p>
    <p>The protesters chanted “the peo­ple want the fall of the regime”, and held posters say­ing “Leave, you are all killers”.</p>
    <p>“We want a fu­ture with dig­nity, we don’t want the blood of the vic­tims of the ex­plo­sion wasted,” said demon­stra­tor Rose Sirour.</p>
    <p>Tues­day’s blast in the port, the big­gest ex­plo­sion in Beirut’s his­tory, killed 158 peo­ple, in­jured 6,000 and de­stroyed a swathe of the city.</p>
    <p>The gov­ern­ment has promised to hold those re­spon­si­ble to ac­count.</p>
    <p>Some res­i­dents, strug­gling to clean up shat­tered homes, com­plained the gov­ern­ment that they see as cor­rupt – there had been months of protests against its han­dling of a deep eco­nomic cri­sis be­fore last week’s dis­as­ter – has let them down again.</p>
    <p>“We have no trust in our gov­ern­ment,” said uni­ver­sity stu­dent Ce­line Dibo, as she scrubbed blood off the walls of her shat­tered apart­ment build­ing. “I wish the United Na­tions would take over Lebanon.”</p>
    <p>Sev­eral peo­ple said they were not at all sur­prised that French Pres­i­dent Em­manuel Macron had vis­ited their gut­ted neigh­bour­hoods near the epi­cen­tre of the blast last week, while Le­banese lead­ers had not.</p>
    <p>“We are liv­ing in ground zero. I hope an­other coun­try would just take us over. Our lead­ers are a bunch of cor­rupt peo­ple,” said psy­chol­o­gist Maryse Hayek, 48, whose par­ents’ house was de­stroyed.</p>
    <p>Lebanon’s Kataeb Party, a Chris­tian group that op­poses the gov­ern­ment backed by the Iran-aligned Hizbol­lah, an­nounced yesterday the res­ig­na­tion of its three law­mak­ers from Par­lia­ment. “I in­vite all hon­ourable (law­mak­ers) to re­sign so that the peo­ple can de­cide who will gov­ern them, with­out any­body im­pos­ing any­thing to them,” said party chief Samy Ge­mayel, an­nounc­ing the move dur­ing the funeral of a lead­ing mem­ber of the group who died in the ex­plo­sion.</p>
    <p>Mr Macron, who vis­ited Beirut on Thurs­day, promised an­gry crowds that aid to re­build the city would not fall into “cor­rupt hands”.</p>
    <p>He will host a donor con­fer­ence for Lebanon via video link today, his of­fice said.</p>
    <p>Le­banese Prime Min­is­ter Has­san Diab has said 2,750 tonnes of highly ex­plo­sive am­mo­nium ni­trate, which is used in mak­ing fer­tilis­ers and bombs, had been stored for six years with­out safety mea­sures at the port ware­house.</p>
    <p>Pres­i­dent Michel Aoun said on Fri­day an in­ves­ti­ga­tion would ex­am­ine whether it was caused by a bomb or other ex­ter­nal in­ter­fer­ence. Mr Aoun said the in­ves­ti­ga­tion would also weigh if the blast was due to neg­li­gence or an ac­ci­dent. Twenty peo­ple had been de­tained so far, he added.</p>
    <p>Some res­i­dents won­dered how they would ever re­build their lives.</p>
    <p>Bull­doz­ers ploughed through the wreck­age of man­gled homes and long rows of flat­tened cars as sol­diers stood by. Vol­un­teers with shov­els streamed through streets.</p>
    <p>Ms Danielle Che­maly said her char­ity or­gan­i­sa­tion, whose head­quar­ters was de­stroyed, had pro­vided as­sis­tance to 70 fam­i­lies who were left home­less.</p>
    <p>“We have given peo­ple ini­tial help, but we don’t know what we can do for fam­i­lies in the fu­ture. It re­quires ma­jor projects,” she said.</p>
    <p>Of­fi­cials have said the blast could have caused losses amount­ing to US$15 bil­lion (S$21 bil­lion).</p>
    <p>That is a bill that Lebanon can­not pay af­ter al­ready de­fault­ing on a moun­tain of debt – ex­ceed­ing 150 per cent of eco­nomic out­put – and with talks stalled on a life­line from the In­ter­na­tional Mone­tary Fund.</p>
    <p>France and other coun­tries have rushed emer­gency aid to Lebanon, in­clud­ing doc­tors, and tons of health equip­ment and food.</p>
    <p>The blast de­stroyed Lebanon’s only ma­jor grain silo and UN agen­cies are help­ing to pro­vide emer­gency food and med­i­cal aid.</p>
    <p>Arab League Chief Ahmed Aboul Gheit said af­ter a meet­ing with Mr Aoun yesterday he would seek to mo­bilise Arab ef­forts to pro­vide sup­port to Lebanon. Also speak­ing af­ter meet­ing Mr Aoun, Turk­ish VicePres­i­dent Fuat Ok­tay said his coun­try is ready to help re­build the port.</p>
    <p>For or­di­nary Le­banese, the scale of de­struc­tion is over­whelm­ing.</p>
    <p>Ms Marita Abou Jawda was hand­ing out bread and cheese to vic­tims of the blast. “Macron of­fered to help and our gov­ern­ment has not done any­thing. It has al­ways been like that,” she said.</p>
