    <p>Leaked news this month that China and Iran had come to the verge of sign­ing a 25-year trade and mil­i­tary part­ner­ship agree­ment struck like a geopo­lit­i­cal storm in Wash­ing­ton – a ris­ing ri­val of Amer­ica and a long-time foe join­ing forces to threaten the United States’ pre­dom­i­nant po­si­tion in the</p>
    <p>Mid­dle East.</p>
    <p>The agree­ment am­bi­tiously prom­ises to bring a huge Chi­nese pres­ence into Iran’s economic de­vel­op­ment, in ex­change for a reg­u­lar sup­ply of heav­ily dis­counted Ira­nian oil.</p>
    <p>Yet in Iran and China them­selves, the re­ac­tion was hardly ebul­lient.</p>
    <p>Critics of Iran’s be­lea­guered Pres­i­dent Has­san Rouhani called the deal a new Treaty of</p>
    <p>Turk­men­chay, after the no­to­ri­ous 1828 ac­cord un­der which a weak­ened Per­sia ceded much of the South Cau­ca­sus to the Rus­sian Em­pire.</p>
    <p>In Bei­jing, a gov­ern­ment spokesman who was asked about the deal dodged rather than crit­i­cise Wash­ing­ton, in­sist­ing blandly that Iran is merely one of many coun­tries with which China is “de­vel­op­ing nor­mal friendly re­la­tions”, and claim­ing not to have fur­ther in­for­ma­tion about the re­ported deal.</p>
    <p>Te­heran’s and Bei­jing’s am­biva­lence hardly sug­gests a lov­ing em­brace be­tween the two ad­ver­saries of Amer­ica; rather, it re­veals the conundrum each faces in pur­su­ing closer ties with the other – co­nun­drums that the United States can turn to its ad­van­tage.</p>
    <p>In re­cent years, as the US has been bogged down in un­re­ward­ing con­flicts in the Mid­dle East, China has been qui­etly ex­pand­ing its economic, diplomatic and even mil­i­tary ac­tiv­i­ties in the re­gion.</p>
    <p>Bei­jing’s mo­tives are straight­for­ward but var­ied: It seeks to ad­vance its in­ter­ests, such as a press­ing need for en­ergy im­ports and for des­ti­na­tions for sur­plus cap­i­tal and labour.</p>
    <p>In prac­tice, it tries to ad­vance Pres­i­dent Xi Jin­ping’s sig­na­ture Belt and Road Ini­tia­tive, which is aimed at re­shap­ing re­gional economic to­pogra­phies in China’s favour and coun­ters what Bei­jing sees as an Amer­i­can ef­fort to con­tain it.</p>
    <p>REA­SONS FOR CAU­TION</p>
    <p>In short, China seeks to es­tab­lish it­self in the eyes of the world – and its own peo­ple – as a great power ca­pa­ble of con­tend­ing with the United States. Yet Chi­nese lead­ers are aware that few of the great pow­ers have emerged un­scathed from Mid­dle East ad­ven­tures and that they face a par­tic­u­larly for­mi­da­ble set of ob­sta­cles.</p>
    <p>The re­gion’s deep po­lit­i­cal fis­sures make it dif­fi­cult for out­siders to avoid tak­ing sides in its many con­flicts. This poses a risk for a China that aims to be a friend of ev­ery­one – Iran, Is­rael and Arab states alike – to max­imise the ben­e­fits of its re­gional en­gage­ment while min­imis­ing its com­mit­ments.</p>
    <p>Con­sis­tent with this bal­anc­ing act, the leak of the China-Iran agree­ment roughly co­in­cided with the bian­nual China-Arab States Co­op­er­a­tion Fo­rum early this month, which prompted nu­mer­ous procla­ma­tions of Chi­nese friend­ship with Iran’s Arab ri­vals.</p>
    <p>Even more daunt­ing is the out­size role played by the US in the re­gion, one that iron­i­cally ben­e­fits Bei­jing as it ex­pands its economic ven­tures without be­ing able to pro­vide ad­e­quate se­cu­rity for its cap­i­tal and cit­i­zens de­ployed to the re­gion.</p>
    <p>For all its “wolf warrior” blus­ter, China con­tin­ues to pick its bat­tles with Wash­ing­ton. So far, it largely has cho­sen not to wage them in the Mid­dle East – for ex­am­ple, do­ing lit­tle be­yond diplomatic finger-wag­ging to shel­ter Iran from Amer­i­can sec­ondary sanc­tions.</p>
    <p>So even as China seeks to make strategic gains in the Mid­dle East, it does so sotto voce – bol­ster­ing its own role and chal­leng­ing Wash­ing­ton’s without fan­fare.</p>
    <p>THE IRA­NIAN CONUNDRUM</p>
    <p>Iran, China’s fore­most re­gional part­ner, faces a conundrum of its own. Squeezed by Amer­ica’s “max­i­mum pres­sure” cam­paign, Te­heran needs what­ever friends it can find. And China, which be­sides be­ing rich and pow­er­ful shares Iran’s re­vi­sion­ist in­cli­na­tion to chal­lenge the United States’ role in the in­ter­na­tional or­der, would seem to be a per­fect match.</p>
    <p>Yet Iran’s his­tory has made it sus­pi­cious of ex­ter­nal pow­ers, and China’s “help” in re­cent years – buy­ing Ira­nian oil in small quan­ti­ties at a steep dis­count and crowd­ing out Ira­nian do­mes­tic pro­duc­ers with low-cost im­ports – seems not to have en­gen­dered af­fec­tion among the Ira­nian pop­u­lace.</p>
    <p>What Ira­ni­ans seem to de­sire is to be no one’s ju­nior part­ner, but to be self-suf­fi­cient and stand among the likes of Rus­sia and China as equals.</p>
    <p>What amount to chal­lenges for China and Iran in fur­ther de­vel­op­ing their ties con­sti­tute op­por­tu­ni­ties for an Amer­ica wor­ried about the part­ner­ship be­tween them.</p>
    <p>The United States should, at ev­ery step, aim to ex­ac­er­bate the co­nun­drums each faces. It should, for ex­am­ple, em­pha­sise that Ira­nian de­pen­dence on China – be­sides be­ing costly – is a policy choice and that the door re­mains open to the rest of the in­ter­na­tional com­mu­nity if Te­heran is will­ing to com­pro­mise on its nu­clear am­bi­tions and re­gional poli­cies.</p>
    <p>And Wash­ing­ton should en­list re­gional part­ners – who may oth­er­wise pre­fer to en­joy the ben­e­fits of good re­la­tions with Bei­jing, while leav­ing it up to the United States to con­front China when it em­pow­ers Iran through arms sales or in­vest­ment.</p>
    <p>Make no mis­take: The China-Iran re­la­tion­ship has long been im­por­tant for both coun­tries, con­tribut­ing for ex­am­ple to Iran’s nu­clear and mis­sile ad­vance­ments.</p>
    <p>And whether in the form of for­mal part­ner­ship agree­ments or sim­ply ad hoc co­op­er­a­tion, those re­la­tions are very likely to grow closer yet in com­ing years, as China tries to project power west­ward and Iran seeks to in­su­late it­self from the de­bil­i­tat­ing ef­fects of Amer­i­can power and en­hance its own re­gional in­flu­ence.</p>
    <p>But while the deep­en­ing of the Iran-China re­la­tion­ship may be in­evitable, the United States shouldn’t let it be easy for ei­ther Te­heran or Bei­jing.</p>
    <p>What amount to chal­lenges for China and Iran in fur­ther de­vel­op­ing their ties con­sti­tute op­por­tu­ni­ties for an Amer­ica wor­ried about the part­ner­ship be­tween them.</p>
