    <p>• The wife of for­mer Pe­nang chief min­is­ter Lim Guan Eng and a busi­ness­woman, Ms Phang Li Koon, were ar­rested by the Pe­nang of­fice of Malaysia’s anti-graft agency yes­ter­day, lo­cal me­dia re­ported, rais­ing spec­u­la­tion that Lim will again be charged over the 2015 pur­chase of a bun­ga­low.</p>
    <p>The women were at the of­fice to give their state­ments to the Malaysian Anti-Cor­rup­tion Com­mis­sion (MACC), lo­cal me­dia said.</p>
    <p>Lim’s wife, Ms Betty Chew, left the MACC build­ing some five hours later at around 4.30pm af­ter post­ing bail of RM50,000 (S$16,500), Ber­nama news agency re­ported.</p>
    <p>Ms Chew’s lawyer, Mr Lee Khai, said she will be charged in a But­ter­worth court on Tues­day un­der the anti-money laun­der­ing Act, though it was un­clear if it will be re­lated to the pur­chase of the bun­ga­low by Lim from Ms Phang.</p>
    <p>Lim, Malaysia’s for­mer fi­nance min­is­ter, was yes­ter­day charged at the Spe­cial Cor­rup­tion Court in Kuala Lumpur for so­lic­it­ing a bribe over a con­tro­ver­sial un­der­sea tun­nel project dur­ing his ten­ure as Pe­nang chief min­is­ter. He pleaded not guilty.</p>
    <p>In the sep­a­rate bun­ga­low case, Lim had been charged in 2016 for al­legedly re­ceiv­ing grat­i­fi­ca­tion by pur­chas­ing the bun­ga­low from Ms Phang at be­low mar­ket value when he was the chief min­is­ter of the Malaysian state.</p>
    <p>He was also charged with abus­ing his power as chief min­is­ter by re­zon­ing a plot of land that was even­tu­ally ac­quired by Mag­nif­i­cent Em­blem, a firm linked to Ms Phang, who was charged with abet­ment.</p>
    <p>But the court case was dropped, and both Lim and Ms Phang were granted an ac­quit­tal by the High Court in 2018, soon af­ter the Pakatan Hara­pan coali­tion stormed to power in the gen­eral elec­tion.</p>
    <p>The MACC had said then that the ac­quit­tal was “shock­ing”.</p>
