    <p>Ja­pan’s new Prime Min­is­ter Yoshi­hide Suga has cho­sen to visit South-east Asia in his first for­eign trip this week. The aim is to show Ja­pan’s com­mit­ment to the re­gion by strength­en­ing eco­nomic and de­fence ties with two im­por­tant play­ers – Viet­nam, the cur­rent chair of Asean; and In­done­sia, the largest na­tion in the group­ing and a key leader. Tokyo also hopes to gain Asean’s back­ing for its Free and Open Indo-Pa­cific (FOIP) vi­sion, seen by some to con­tain el­e­ments of strate­gic com­pe­ti­tion with China. Mr Suga’s trip comes at a time when Tokyo is seek­ing to counter China’s grow­ing as­sertive­ness in a re­gion that is im­por­tant to Ja­pan both strate­gi­cally and eco­nom­i­cally.</p>
    <p>Much of Ja­pan’s trade, in­clud­ing its cru­cial en­ergy im­ports, flows through the South China Sea where China has ter­ri­to­rial dis­putes with sev­eral Asean mem­bers and has built mil­i­tary in­stal­la­tions on sev­eral ar­ti­fi­cial is­lands. Keep­ing the sea lanes of the dis­puted wa­ters open is im­por­tant. And how the Asean states man­age their dis­putes with China could have a bear­ing on how Ja­pan’s own ter­ri­to­rial dis­pute with China over the Senkaku/Diaoyu is­lands plays out. Tokyo’s ef­forts to strengthen ties with the re­gion are wel­come.</p>
    <p>An an­nual sur­vey by the ISEAS – Yu­sof Ishak In­sti­tute re­leased in Jan­uary showed that Ja­pan is seen as the most trusted ma­jor power in South­east Asia. Its eco­nomic ties are deep. In the past decade alone, it in­vested a net US$139 bil­lion (S$188 bil­lion) in five Asean na­tions. It now aims to di­ver­sify its sup­ply chains – away from China and back in­stead to Ja­pan, and also to South-east Asia, by of­fer­ing sub­si­dies to firms to do so. This is wel­comed by the re­gion. Tokyo’s ef­forts to im­prove bi­lat­eral de­fence ties are also seen as a plus at a time when some re­gional states are seek­ing to beef up their de­fence ca­pa­bil­i­ties as ten­sions be­tween China and the United States rise. In­done­sian Pres­i­dent Joko Wi­dodo told a news con­fer­ence with Mr Suga that closer co­op­er­a­tion be­tween their two coun­tries was crit­i­cal amid in­creas­ingly sharp ri­val­ries be­tween the world’s great pow­ers.</p>
    <p>But the re­gion is more am­biva­lent to­wards the FOIP vi­sion, which is tied to the Quadri­lat­eral Se­cu­rity Di­a­logue (Quad) in­volv­ing Ja­pan, the US, In­dia and Aus­tralia. The ISEAS sur­vey showed 54 per cent of re­gional states found the FOIP con­cept am­bigu­ous, while 54.2 per cent were scep­ti­cal about the Quad. A ma­jor worry for Asean is that the FOIP will side­line the group­ing and threaten its cen­tral­ity in the re­gion. Asean’s other con­cern is that par­tic­i­pat­ing in the FOIP will trig­ger a back­lash from Bei­jing, which sees the con­cept and the Quad as at­tempts to curb its rise. In reach­ing out to the re­gion, Tokyo must con­vince Asean that FOIP is aligned with the group’s out­look on the Indo-Pa­cific, which stresses in­clu­sive­ness, trans­parency, re­spect for in­ter­na­tional law as well as Asean cen­tral­ity in the Indo-Pa­cific.</p>
