    <p>A man who put up of­fen­sive Face­book posts has been given a stern warn­ing from the po­lice for ha­rass­ment and post­ing com­ments on so­cial me­dia that pro­mote en­mity among dif­fer­ent groups on grounds of re­li­gion or race.</p>
    <p>The so­cial me­dia posts in ques­tion were made on Feb 8 and July 5 by a man us­ing the moniker Ab­dul Ma­lik Mo­hammed Ghaz­ali, the po­lice said in a state­ment yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>On Feb 8, Mr Ab­dul Ma­lik put up two sep­a­rate so­cial me­dia posts that pro­moted en­mity be­tween dif­fer­ent groups on grounds of re­li­gion or race, the state­ment added.</p>
    <p>A so­cial me­dia post on July 5, po­lice said, com­mit­ted the of­fence of mak­ing a threat­en­ing com­mu­ni­ca­tion likely to cause alarm un­der the Pro­tec­tion from Ha­rass­ment Act.</p>
    <p>In that post, Mr Ab­dul Ma­lik had re­ferred to so­cial me­dia posts made by Sengkang GRC MP Raeesah Khan from the Work­ers’ Party. He said he was “one of the first to leak out and (make) vi­ral screen­shots” of Ms Raeesah’s so­cial me­dia ac­counts.</p>
    <p>In the same post, he said: “Who cares about your fa­ther? SMCCI very big meh? Best for you to step down, Raeesah, or he’ll be next.”</p>
    <p>Ms Raeesah’s fa­ther, Mr Farid Khan, is pres­i­dent of the SMCCI, or Sin­ga­pore Malay Cham­ber of Com­merce and In­dus­try. He launched a bid to con­test the Sin­ga­pore pres­i­den­tial elec­tion in 2017 but was deemed in­el­i­gi­ble.</p>
    <p>The po­lice, in a sep­a­rate state­ment yes­ter­day, said no fur­ther ac­tion will be taken re­gard­ing on­line posts made by ne­ti­zen Xi­axue, whose real name is Wendy Cheng.</p>
    <p>The po­lice de­clined to pro­vide fur­ther de­tails on what these posts were about, but the in­ves­ti­ga­tion is be­lieved to be linked to com­ments that Ms Cheng made about Ms Raeesah on July 5 and July 6.</p>
    <p>There were also po­lice re­ports filed against Ms Cheng ear­lier this year for racially of­fen­sive tweets that ap­pear to have been tar­geted at for­eign work­ers in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, the po­lice said they had con­sulted the At­tor­ney-Gen­eral’s Cham­bers, which ad­vised that in Ms Cheng’s case, “the el­e­ments of an of­fence have not been es­tab­lished be­yond a rea­son­able doubt”.</p>
