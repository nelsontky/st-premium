    <p>Is­raeli mar­tial art krav maga’s tech­niques can come in handy when self-de­fence is needed</p>
    <p>Blind­ing strobe lights flashed fran­ti­cally around Dawn Ng while thump­ing mu­sic blared. In front of her stood a gauntlet of five men, each armed with what ap­peared to be a knife and bad in­ten­tions.</p>
    <p>But one by one, the 1.53m, 48kg woman swiftly and em­phat­i­cally dealt with each threat.</p>
    <p>First, a firm block of an in­com­ing arm. Then a kick to the groin, a force­ful yank to the floor and three slams of the wrist onto the ground to dis­lodge the weapon.</p>
    <p>Mo­ments later, the lights came on again and Ng, 25, wore a sweaty, ac­com­plished smile.</p>
    <p>She had passed a “stress test” dur­ing her class at Krav Maga Sin­ga­pore, which fea­tured cre­at­ing a dis­ori­ent­ing at­mos­phere and rub­ber knives to sim­u­late a real at­tack.</p>
    <p>Ng, who works in the me­dia in­dus­try, has been at­tend­ing classes at the gym along Hong Kong Street helmed by for­mer Spe­cial Op­er­a­tions Task Force soldier Sascha So­liano for just over three years.</p>
    <p>She had been look­ing for a mar­tial art-based ac­tiv­ity which was “prac­ti­cal” and also to keep fit.</p>
    <p>“Thanks to the krav maga classes, I feel like I won’t be afraid to de­fend my­self if the si­t­u­a­tion calls for it,” she said. “To be hon­est, if a sce­nario hap­pens on the street, I’m not sure if I’ll be able to re­act ac­cord­ingly but (pre­par­ing for it) is what we try to do in the gym. Bet­ter to know and be able to re­tain a lit­tle, than not know at all.”</p>
    <p>Krav Maga Sin­ga­pore is one of sev­eral gyms that of­fer dif­fer­ent ap­proaches to teach­ing the still rel­a­tively ob­scure self-de­fence sys­tem.</p>
    <p>He­brew for “con­tact com­bat”, krav maga is used by the Is­raeli mil­i­tary and fea­tures a com­bi­na­tion of tech­niques from mar­tial arts like box­ing, wrestling and judo.</p>
    <p>In the last two decades, it has be­come a bit more known to the main­stream, and even movie stars like Chris­tian Bale, Liam Nee­son and Daniel Craig trained in krav maga to pre­pare for their roles in ac­tion flicks.</p>
    <p>In Sin­ga­pore, So­liano was the first to of­fer classes com­mer­cially in 2006. The 45-year-old, who was in­tro­duced to krav maga in the mil­i­tary, said it ap­pealed to him as a “prob­lem solver” and de­cided to un­dergo cour­ses to be­come an in­struc­tor.</p>
    <p>“A lot of times in a real fight, all your mi­cro skills don’t work, and in­stead it is your gross mo­tor skills that will kick in,” he ex­plained.</p>
    <p>“It’s not fan­ci­ful, it’s about sur­viv­ing, and solv­ing the prob­lem in the most di­rect route.”</p>
    <p>Krav maga, he added, is based on a per­son’s nat­u­ral re­flex to a con­fronta­tion. It in­volves tech­niques deemed il­le­gal in mar­tial arts com­pe­ti­tions such as throat jabs, groin strikes and even eye gouges.</p>
    <p>Stu­dents rou­tinely train with rub­ber props like knives, jagged bot­tles and ma­chetes, to help them sim­u­late what could hap­pen when things go sideways on the street.</p>
    <p>An­other stu­dent in So­liano’s class, Sean Blair, said he was hooked on krav maga since his first class 1 ½ years ago be­cause of its “re­al­ism”. The Ja­maican, a soft­ware en­gi­neer who has been based in Sin­ga­pore since 2014, said he keeps re­turn­ing be­cause “no two classes are the same”.</p>
    <p>“You al­ways find there’s some­thing to per­fect, and you will al­ways ask your­self what you can do bet­ter or what is miss­ing in your tech­nique,” said the 41-year-old.</p>
    <p>How­ever, Blair and Ng are out­liers in prac­tis­ing krav maga for an ex­tended pe­riod of time.</p>
    <p>De­spite be­ing com­mer­cial here for al­most 15 years, only about 500 peo­ple are es­ti­mated to be ac­tive in the dis­ci­pline.</p>
    <p>Ed­win Peng, di­rec­tor and head in­struc­tor of an­other gym, Krav</p>
    <p>Maga Global, said the small num­ber can be at­trib­uted to Sin­ga­pore be­ing a safe coun­try.</p>
    <p>“Re­gard­less, there are still cases of vi­o­lent crime in Sin­ga­pore and krav maga also in­stils in its stu­dents soft skills such as sit­u­a­tional aware­ness to iden­tify and avoid dan­ger, self-con­fi­dence, pro­ject­ing strength to avoid be­ing viewed as a po­ten­tial vic­tim and other use­ful tech­niques to keep your­self safe.”</p>
    <p>The 39-year-old, who is also a for­mer Spe­cial Op­er­a­tions Task Force man, said his classes fea­ture a “di­verse” group of peo­ple, from or­thopaedic sur­geons to bankers to teach­ers, and he has stu­dents aged be­tween five and 50.</p>
    <p>Peng, who es­ti­mated women make up al­most half of his stu­dents, added: “Self-de­fence is a life skill and like in­sur­ance – it’s good to have but hope­fully some­thing you never have to use.”</p>

Dur&#xAD;ing her three years of classes in the Is&#xAD;raeli mar&#xAD;tial art, the 25-year-old has trained with rub&#xAD;ber props like knives, jagged bot&#xAD;tles, axes and ma&#xAD;chetes (be&#xAD;low), to help sim&#xAD;u&#xAD;late what could hap&#xAD;pen when things go sideways on the street.</p>
