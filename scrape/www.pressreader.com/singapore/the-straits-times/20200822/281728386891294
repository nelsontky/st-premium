    <p>Plans to re­sume live per­for­mances are un­der way, the Min­istry of Cul­ture, Com­mu­nity and Youth (MCCY) said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Though per­form­ing art shows and con­certs ground to a halt for months dur­ing the Covid-19 cri­sis, MCCY and the National Arts Coun­cil (NAC) are now ex­plor­ing com­mis­sion­ing and pro­gram­ming small-scale pi­lot per­for­mances as trial runs.</p>
    <p>Min­is­ter for Cul­ture, Com­mu­nity and Youth Ed­win Tong said: “Live per­for­mances add a buzz to our so­ci­ety and com­mu­nity. I think we all yearn to be part of a live per­for­mance.</p>
    <p>“We are go­ing to try and pi­lot a few live per­for­mances at a few venues to see how that works out, and if it is safe enough we will scale up.</p>
    <p>“Of course, safety is of para­mount con­sid­er­a­tion, and we want to en­sure that mea­sures are in place, and that the venues are suit­able.”</p>
    <p>MCCY added in a state­ment that it would “en­sure a range of per­for­mances for all com­mu­ni­ties that re­flects Sin­ga­pore’s mul­ti­cul­tural char­ac­ter, to cater to Sin­ga­pore­ans who have not been able to at­tend a show or con­cert over the last few months”.</p>
    <p>It said NAC would re­veal more de­tails about the pi­lots later.</p>
    <p>Mr Tong, who is also Sec­ond Min­is­ter for Law, said he was look­ing at ways to fur­ther sup­port the arts com­mu­nity.</p>
    <p>“We have had the Arts and Cul­ture Re­silience Pack­age and that has gone to sup­port­ing the dig­i­tal space.</p>
    <p>We have gone to sub­sidise venue hires and also sought to give ren­tal (waivers).</p>
    <p>“But I think more can be done be­cause it is some­times easy to as­sume that arts and cul­ture are not es­sen­tial ser­vices. But they do need sup­port and are a vi­tal part of our so­ci­ety.”</p>
    <p>The $55 mil­lion pack­age, which was an­nounced in April to sus­tain the arts com­mu­nity dur­ing the Covid-19 cri­sis, has pro­vided more than 6,000 work and train­ing op­por­tu­ni­ties for arts and cul­ture prac­ti­tion­ers, MCCY said.</p>
    <p>The pack­age has also sup­ported more than 900 dig­i­tal­i­sa­tion ef­forts by lo­cal artists and arts or­gan­i­sa­tions, from Streets Of Hope, an NAC vis­ual arts project of works by 367 artists, to The Straits Times’ 30 Days Of Art part­ner­ship with NAC.</p>
    <p>New mea­sures will in­clude an ad­di­tional grant to sup­port op­er­at­ing costs for arts and cul­ture or­gan­i­sa­tions, as well as those in closely re­lated sec­tors such as me­dia and de­sign.</p>
    <p>Co-work­ing spa­ces at Good­man Arts Cen­tre and Stam­ford Arts Cen­tre will be re­opened over the com­ing weeks, with safe man­age­ment mea­sures in place.</p>
    <p>Arts free­lancers can use these spa­ces for free and also at­tend pro­grammes and we­bi­nars or­gan­ised by the Arts Re­source Hub, such as clin­ics con­ducted by ex­pe­ri­enced free­lancers on how to ac­cess govern­ment sup­port schemes.</p>
    <p>The ap­pli­ca­tion win­dow for the Ca­pa­bil­ity De­vel­op­ment Scheme for the Arts and the Dig­i­tal Pre­sen­ta­tion Grant for the Arts has been ex­tended to Sept 14 to sup­port train­ing or projects un­til March 31 next year.</p>
    <p>Af­ter the Sept 14 dead­line, free­lancers can ap­ply for NAC’s reg­u­lar project grants, some of which have been en­hanced to of­fer higher fund­ing for projects planned for next year.</p>
    <p>The Ca­pa­bil­ity De­vel­op­ment Scheme, which cov­ers course fees as well as ab­sen­tee pay­roll or train­ing al­lowance of $10 per hour, has sup­ported nearly 600 train­ing op­por­tu­ni­ties, half of which were for free­lancers.</p>
    <p>The Dig­i­tal Pre­sen­ta­tion Grant helps artists fund the dig­i­tal­i­sa­tion of their work. It has sup­ported more than 300 projects and pro­vided around 4,500 work op­por­tu­ni­ties, 1,100 of which were for free­lancers.</p>
    <p>Theatremak­er Sai­ful Amri, 42, re­ceived $20,000 from the Dig­i­tal Pre­sen­ta­tion Grant for his project Pang­gung Dig­i­tal 1.9, which fea­tures record­ings of drama­tised read­ings of five ra­dio dra­mas by es­tab­lished writ­ers such as Cul­tural Medal­lion re­cip­i­ent Nadipu­tra and M. Saf­fri A Manaf. It can be viewed on YouTube and Face­book.</p>
    <p>Mr Sai­ful said the grant was help­ful. “All t he projects we had planned were put on hold, so any form of sup­port, we would take with open arms. We had to plan some­thing for this grant par­tic­u­larly. At least we artists had some­thing to do, which we were re­mu­ner­ated for, rather than sit­ting and wait­ing for this whole thing to end.”</p>
