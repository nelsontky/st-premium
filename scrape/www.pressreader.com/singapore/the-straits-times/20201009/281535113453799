    <p>Sin­ga­pore has made sig­nif­i­cant progress in deal­ing with de­men­tia but still has much room for im­prove­ment in ar­eas such as de­tec­tion, ac­cord­ing to a new report. It placed the coun­try in the 16th spot among 30 cities in a study that as­sessed their readi­ness to pro­mote novel ap­proaches in com­bat­ing the con­di­tion.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore has made sig­nif­i­cant progress in deal­ing with de­men­tia but still has much room for im­prove­ment in ar­eas like de­tec­tion, ac­cord­ing to a new report.</p>
    <p>It placed the coun­try in 16th spot among 30 cities in a study that as­sessed their readi­ness to pro­mote novel ap­proaches in com­bat­ing the con­di­tion. While Sin­ga­pore scored rel­a­tively well in ar­eas like strat­egy and com­mit­ment, it did not do as well in early de­tec­tion and di­ag­no­sis.</p>
    <p>The find­ings from the 2020 De­men­tia In­no­va­tion Readi­ness In­dex were re­leased by the United States-based Global Coali­tion on Age­ing (GCOA), Bri­tain’s Alzheimer’s Dis­ease In­ter­na­tional (ADI) and Sin­ga­pore’s Lien Foun­da­tion at a vir­tual event yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The best per­form­ing city was London, which is known for its pro­gres­sive poli­cies and prac­tices with re­gard to de­men­tia care. Glas­gow was next, fol­lowed by Manch­ester.</p>
    <p>The top per­form­ers tended to be in high-in­come coun­tries with some level of na­tion­alised health­care and a na­tional plan that helps pro­mote in­no­va­tion at city level, said a state­ment ac­com­pa­ny­ing the report.</p>
    <p>Tokyo, in sev­enth place, was the best per­former of the 10 Asian cities eval­u­ated, fol­lowed by Seoul in 11th spot and Taipei in 15th.</p>
    <p>While Asian cities tended to crowd the bot­tom half of the in­dex, they also largely have younger pop­u­la­tions than in Europe, so de­men­tia is not yet a pol­icy pri­or­ity, said the state­ment.</p>
    <p>The report, which aims to chal­lenge cities to de­velop and adopt in­no­va­tions to im­prove de­men­tia care, looked at readi­ness to in­no­vate in five cat­e­gories – strat­egy and com­mit­ment; early de­tec­tion and di­ag­no­sis; ac­cess to care; com­mu­nity sup­port; and business en­vi­ron­ment.</p>
    <p>Pub­licly avail­able data and on-the­ground in­sights from nearly 100 ex­perts in the cities were con­sid­ered.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore came in 9th with re­gard to strat­egy and com­mit­ment, 10th for com­mu­nity sup­port and third for business en­vi­ron­ment, but lagged be­hind in 21st place with re­gard to early de­tec­tion and di­ag­no­sis and 18th for ac­cess to care.</p>
    <p>The state­ment noted the solid gov­ern­ment lead­er­ship on de­men­tia and age-re­lated is­sues, es­pe­cially in re­cent years, with more fund­ing go­ing into long-term care, in­clud­ing for de­men­tia.</p>
    <p>“Un­like many cities, Sin­ga­pore also has a de­men­tia plan in place, al­though there is a need to make it pub­lic,” the state­ment said.</p>
    <p>The bar­ri­ers in­clude the lack of pub­licly avail­able di­ag­no­sis rates. Ac­cu­rate and early di­ag­no­sis can help to en­sure that the pro­gres­sion of the dis­ease is ap­pro­pri­ately man­aged and mon­i­tored, for in­stance.</p>
    <p>The three part­ners be­hind the in­dex said that cities have largely failed to sup­port in­no­va­tion in de­men­tia care com­pre­hen­sively, al­though bright spots ex­ist.</p>
    <p>“Age­ing and ur­ban­i­sa­tion are the twin defin­ing trends of our time,” said Ms Radha Basu, the Lien Foun­da­tion’s re­search di­rec­tor.</p>
    <p>“As so­ci­eties age and de­men­tia be­comes more com­mon, this in­dex is­sues a clear call to city-level lead­ers and helps cities learn from each other on how to best man­age this great, global chal­lenge to health and so­cial care.”</p>
    <p>This is the first de­men­tia in­no­va­tion readi­ness study to fo­cus on cities. It came about af­ter the Lien Foun­da­tion ap­proached GCOA and ADI in late 2018 to col­lab­o­rate on the ini­tia­tive. GCOA and ADI had ear­lier col­lab­o­rated on two in­dexes that eval­u­ated de­men­tia in­no­va­tion readi­ness in se­lected coun­tries in 2017 and 2018.</p>
