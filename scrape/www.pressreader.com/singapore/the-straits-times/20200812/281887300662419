    <p>The coro­n­avirus pan­demic is the cri­sis of a gen­er­a­tion, but it can also mould that gen­er­a­tion, through a unity achieved by shared ex­pe­ri­ence of an ex­is­ten­tial or­deal. Out­siders look­ing at Sin­ga­pore will use the level of that unity as a yard­stick to judge Sin­ga­pore­ans as a peo­ple. These two themes were at the fore­front of this year’s National Day cel­e­bra­tions. Cer­tainly, the mood was sub­dued. There were no mass cel­e­bra­tions on Sun­day. A scaled-down pa­rade in the morn­ing at the Padang fea­tured only about 200 par­tic­i­pants, while the in­door even­ing show had 87 per­form­ers. The pa­rade had just four masked con­tin­gents oc­cu­py­ing less than a third of the Padang, with 150 spec­ta­tors, a far cry from last year’s 27,000-strong au­di­ence. How­ever, time-hon­oured com­po­nents of the pa­rade were brought to the heart­land through parachutis­ts and an aerial dis­play. Also, mo­bile col­umns rolled through the streets of towns and hous­ing es­tates for a sec­ond con­sec­u­tive year to bring the show closer to Sin­ga­pore­ans. All in all, National Day this year re­mained fa­mil­iar in spite of it be­ing held against the back­drop of an out­break that threat­ened to take the no­tion of fes­tiv­ity out of the imag­i­na­tion of Sin­ga­pore­ans try­ing to come to terms with it.</p>
    <p>They should not lose heart. The epi­demi­o­log­i­cal cri­sis helped show the con­ti­nu­ity of Sin­ga­pore life in ways that should shore up peo­ple’s con­fi­dence in them­selves. The sac­ri­fices made by health­care work­ers and oth­ers, who are on the front line of the bat­tle against Covid-19, re­veal the tena­cious ca­pac­ity to care for oth­ers in spite of the dread of catch­ing the disease them­selves. The Sars (se­vere acute res­pi­ra­tory syn­drome) out­break sev­eral years ago elicited a sim­i­lar re­sponse here. In spite of the heav­ier med­i­cal, eco­nomic and so­cial weight of Covid-19 this time, the same Sin­ga­porean spirit has come to the fore again. This re­silience sug­gests that cit­i­zens are mould­ing cir­cum­stances even as they are be­ing af­fected by them. Since Covid-19 looks set to be present for some time to come, the so­cial de­fences be­ing de­vel­oped against it, day af­ter day, should be­come a source of gen­er­a­tional im­mu­nity to ad­ver­sity as well.</p>
    <p>These in­stinc­tive val­ues are im­por­tant on their own. They touch, too, on the way the world sees Sin­ga­pore. For­eign part­ners might not have taken the coun­try se­ri­ously had they not thought that cit­i­zens and so­ci­ety here were de­ter­mined and united. This may be true of ev­ery coun­try, but the odds al­ways are stacked against the sur­vival of a city state with hardly any nat­u­ral re­sources. Sin­ga­pore’s spe­cial de­pen­dence on a global mar­ket­place de­mands that it stays fight­ing fit to sur­vive eco­nomic down­turns and still pre­serve enough en­ergy to ben­e­fit from an up­turn when it ar­rives, as it must do one day. De­spon­dency, es­capism and fa­tal­ism have not made Sin­ga­pore. Re­silience re­mains the or­der of the day.</p>
