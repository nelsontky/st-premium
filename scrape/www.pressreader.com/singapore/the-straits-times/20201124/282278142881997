    <p>NEW DELHI • Vis­tara, an In­dian full-ser­vice air­line owned by Tata Group and Sin­ga­pore Air­lines, is con­sid­er­ing start­ing di­rect flights to the United States as the Covid-19 pan­demic in­creases de­mand for non­stop travel, a se­nior ex­ec­u­tive said last Friday.</p>
    <p>While the spe­cific time­frame and air­craft re­quire­ments are yet to be fi­nalised, Vis­tara is study­ing var­i­ous sce­nar­ios for di­rect flights, the air­line’s chief com­mer­cial of­fi­cer Vinod Kan­nan told Reuters.</p>
    <p>The coro­n­avirus pan­demic brought air travel to a grind­ing halt ear­lier this year as na­tions im­posed travel bans. While travel has re­sumed to some ex­tent, pas­sen­ger num­bers re­main far be­low pre­vi­ous lev­els and a full re­cov­ery could take years.</p>
    <p>Vis­tara has seen a rise in de­mand for non-stop flights, as pas­sen­gers try to avoid stopovers to re­duce the risk of get­ting in­fected – a trend it ex­pects will con­tinue in the fu­ture.</p>
    <p>Flag car­rier Air In­dia is the only In­dian air­line cur­rently of­fer­ing di­rect flights to the US.</p>
    <p>Mr Kan­nan said: “This means there is def­i­nitely an op­por­tu­nity... to fly di­rect to the US, and it is an op­por­tu­nity we are look­ing at.”</p>
    <p>Vis­tara, which started in­ter­na­tional flights last year, cur­rently op­er­ates two Boe­ing wide-body planes and has four more on or­der, but Mr Kan­nan said the spec­i­fi­ca­tions and lay­out were not suited for di­rect flights to the US.</p>
    <p>Whether Vis­tara would look at or­der­ing new planes or leas­ing them is un­der dis­cus­sion.</p>
    <p>“In to­day’s sit­u­a­tion it is much eas­ier to lease a wide­body com­pared with one year ago. Those op­por­tu­ni­ties and sce­nar­ios are be­ing worked on,” Mr Kan­nan said.</p>
    <p>Prior to Covid-19, the air­line flew to des­ti­na­tions like Bangkok and Sin­ga­pore and had plans to start fly­ing to Ja­pan and Europe. Its in­ter­na­tional flights are now lim­ited to des­ti­na­tions like Lon­don and Dubai, with which In­dia has a bi­lat­eral “air bub­ble” ar­range­ment to op­er­ate di­rect flights.</p>
