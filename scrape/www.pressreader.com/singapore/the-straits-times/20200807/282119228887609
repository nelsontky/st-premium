    <p>The pro­posed changes by the Sin­ga­pore Ex­change’s reg­u­la­tory arm, Sin­ga­pore Ex­change Reg­u­la­tion (SGX RegCo), to strengthen its en­force­ment pow­ers and re­quire listed com­pa­nies to have spe­cific whis­tle-blow­ing poli­cies can help to re­as­sure in­vestors, said ex­perts.</p>
    <p>But they added that firms must also do their part in en­sur­ing trans­parency and ac­count­abil­ity.</p>
    <p>Mr David Ger­ald, founder, pres­i­dent and chief ex­ec­u­tive of the Se­cu­ri­ties In­vestors As­so­ci­a­tion (Sin­ga­pore), or Sias, said: “The pro­posed new changes to the list­ing rules will pro­vide SGX RegCo with greater flex­i­bil­ity and pro­vide swifter ac­count­abil­ity, and clar­ity, in the se­cu­ri­ties mar­ket through its gov­ern­ing en­force­ment ac­tions.</p>
    <p>“While SGX RegCo al­ready has myr­iad other tools to mon­i­tor and en­force an or­derly mar­ket, these new pro­posed amend­ments will mean swift and ap­pro­pri­ate en­force­ment... This will only re­as­sure in­vestors.”</p>
    <p>As­so­ciate Pro­fes­sor Lawrence Loh of the Na­tional Univer­sity of Sin­ga­pore (NUS) Busi­ness School said quick en­force­ment re­sponse is fun­da­men­tal to the smooth func­tion­ing of the stock ex­change.</p>
    <p>“The new en­force­ment pow­ers thus ben­e­fit in­vestors, who will now have bet­ter as­sur­ances and con­fi­dence in the is­suers – this will, in turn, feed­back to the is­suers (through) bet­ter liq­uid­ity and turnover.”</p>
    <p>As­so­ciate Pro­fes­sor Mak Yuen Teen, also of NUS Busi­ness School, said he had pre­vi­ously ex­pressed con­cern about an en­force­ment process with too many lay­ers.</p>
    <p>“I be­lieve the aim (of the sug­gested changes) is to make the en­force­ment process less bu­reau­cratic and I am fully sup­port­ive of that,” he said.</p>
    <p>SGX RegCo also pro­posed that listed com­pa­nies be re­quired to have a whis­tle-blow­ing pol­icy.</p>
    <p>Mr Ger­ald said the move will im­prove cor­po­rate gov­er­nance, but Prof Mak said the ef­fec­tive­ness of such a pol­icy also de­pends on how the com­pa­nies choose to im­ple­ment it.</p>
    <p>“Even if they are manda­tory, it doesn’t mean they will be ef­fec­tive,” Prof Mak said, cit­ing firms where cor­po­rate cul­ture is poor as an ex­am­ple. “It’s very easy in such cases to brush aside whistle­blow­ing com­plaints rather than in­ves­ti­gate them even if there is enough ev­i­dence sup­port­ing such com­plaints.”</p>
    <p>Mr Ger­ald said: “Com­pa­nies them­selves must rise to the chal­lenge to en­sure trans­parency and ac­count­abil­ity... (They) should make timely and mean­ing­ful dis­clo­sures, not just ma­te­ri­ally price­sen­si­tive but trade-sen­si­tive in­for­ma­tion as well.”</p>
