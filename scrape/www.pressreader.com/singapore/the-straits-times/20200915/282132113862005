    <p>How can we im­prove cus­tomer ser­vice stan­dards in Sin­ga­pore?</p>
    <p>Where Sin­ga­pore is lack­ing is in ar­eas like ex­change and re­fund poli­cies, re­place­ment of faulty items, and so on. I’ve bought elec­tronic items that were faulty and then been told that they have to go to the ser­vice cen­tre for a cou­ple of weeks. That’s not ac­cept­able. Steven Rostron</p>
    <p>Two ways to im­prove stan­dards:</p>
    <p>First, the com­pany needs to em­pha­sise cus­tomer ser­vice and pro­vide bet­ter train­ing, and stop the “em­ploy­ing cheap labour” mind­set.</p>
    <p>Sec­ond, the sta­tus of cus­tomer ser­vice of­fi­cers needs to change. Peo­ple of­ten treat them like dirt and scold them even though they have done noth­ing wrong. They should be treated as pro­fes­sion­als.</p>
    <p>Liew Guo Kang</p>
    <p>“The cus­tomer is king” – this is what I learnt years ago while work­ing in the re­tail sec­tor in New York – a city where be­ing de­mand­ing is sec­ond na­ture.</p>
    <p>Train­ing is the most im­por­tant thing, then allowing work­ers to have the flex­i­bil­ity and creativity to solve prob­lems within the de­ter­mined guide­lines of the com­pany. There is also the pay and in­cen­tive is­sue.</p>
    <p>Fi­nally, there is the need for em­pa­thy and pa­tience, and deal­ing with a sit­u­a­tion in a man­ner that ben­e­fits the cus­tomer and the com­pany. Pa­tri­cia Var­gas Schreiber</p>
    <p>How can more peo­ple be per­suaded to get vac­ci­nated against preventabl­e dis­eases?</p>
    <p>Low­er­ing the cost is def­i­nitely good, but this needs to be com­ple­mented by mak­ing the vac­cines manda­tory in­stead of elec­tive. A sched­ule can be cre­ated for each in­di­vid­ual to go for dif­fer­ent vac­ci­na­tions as and when it is con­ve­nient for them. This should be within a cer­tain time pe­riod so that it is ef­fi­cient. Kevin Tan</p>
    <p>If vac­cines are safe, why do vac­cine mak­ers ask for exemption from li­a­bil­ity for in­juries caused by vac­cines?</p>
    <p>Preven­tion truly comes from tak­ing care of your body through a healthy diet and life­style, ad­e­quate sleep and rest, pos­i­tive emo­tional and men­tal states.</p>
    <p>A healthy en­vi­ron­ment is also key: proper san­i­ta­tion, clean air and clean water.</p>
    <p>Lawrence Lee</p>
    <p>Pro­mote the value of vac­cine jabs and keep them af­ford­able and eas­ily avail­able at any clinic. Harry Chia</p>
