    <p>About 8,100 of Sin­ga­pore’s stall­hold­ers have gone dig­i­tal by adopt­ing e-pay­ment sys­tems as of last month un­der the Hawk­ers Go Dig­i­tal scheme.</p>
    <p>This is al­most half of the oneyear tar­get that the Gov­ern­ment set for it­self in June, and shows that Sin­ga­pore is mak­ing progress in its jour­ney to be dig­i­tally in­clu­sive, said Com­mu­ni­ca­tions and In­for­ma­tion Min­is­ter S. Iswaran.</p>
    <p>The scheme aims to help all 18,000 stall­hold­ers here adopt the uni­fied Sin­ga­pore Quick Re­sponse Code (SGQR) e-pay­ment so­lu­tion by the mid­dle of next year.</p>
    <p>Mr Iswaran told The Straits Times in a re­cent in­ter­view that dig­i­tal­i­sa­tion is a jour­ney, not a des­ti­na­tion. It is key that the Gov­ern­ment stays nim­ble in un­der­stand­ing and re­spond­ing to the chang­ing needs of dif­fer­ent groups, he said.</p>
    <p>Se­niors, for in­stance, are cur­rently be­ing guided on how to make pay­ments us­ing QR codes and how to look up in­for­ma­tion that may be rel­e­vant to them un­der the Se­niors Go Dig­i­tal move­ment.</p>
    <p>More than 36,000 se­niors have been en­gaged un­der this move­ment to learn dig­i­tal tools and skills, Mr Iswaran said in Par­lia­ment this week. This is more than a third of the Gov­ern­ment’s tar­get by next March.</p>
    <p>Should dig­i­tal ser­vices such as telemedici­ne be­come more wide­spread in fu­ture, he said, the Gov­ern­ment will have to help se­niors on this front as well to en­sure they can ac­cess health­care from the com­fort of their homes.</p>
    <p>He also stressed the need for the Gov­ern­ment to part­ner the com­mu­nity and the in­dus­try in or­der to meet its goal of giv­ing all Sin­ga­pore­ans ac­cess to tech tools as well as dig­i­tal know-how. “The Gov­ern­ment has to en­gen­der the en­vi­ron­ment that would be sup­port­ive of this trans­for­ma­tion,” he said.</p>
    <p>“But equally, we need to work in part­ner­ship: Part­ner­ship with in­dus­try, part­ner­ship with en­ter­prises, but per­haps even more im­por­tantly, part­ner­ship with the peo­ple.”</p>
    <p>One such high-pro­file pri­vate­sec­tor part­ner­ship is with tech­nol­ogy and man­u­fac­tur­ing firm ST Engi­neer­ing, which do­nated $1 mil­lion to the In­fo­comm Me­dia De­vel­op­ment Au­thor­ity (IMDA) in June to help low-in­come house­holds and in­di­vid­u­als gain ac­cess to dig­i­tal and con­nec­tiv­ity tools.</p>
    <p>Sim­i­larly, telco Sing­tel an­nounced in Septem­ber a $3 mil­lion com­mu­nity care pack­age to help se­niors learn more about tech tools and skills, and help small and medium-sized en­ter­prises dig­i­talise their op­er­a­tions.</p>
    <p>Var­i­ous com­mu­nity groups are also step­ping up to con­trib­ute, with some pro­mot­ing me­dia lit­er­acy and oth­ers help­ing to teach peo­ple how to use tech, Mr Iswaran said.</p>
    <p>This comes on top of ex­ist­ing gov­ern­ment schemes and ini­tia­tives, in­clud­ing the set­ting up of the SG</p>
    <p>Dig­i­tal Of­fice to dou­ble down on out­reach ef­forts to the hard­est-tore­ach seg­ments of so­ci­ety, such as se­niors and hawk­ers.</p>
    <p>There is also a sep­a­rate Silver In­fo­comm Well­ness Am­bas­sador (Siwa) pro­gramme, which was in­tro­duced eight years ago. Siwa ap­points se­niors as am­bas­sadors of dig­i­tal life­styles in the hope of in­spir­ing more of their peers to adopt prac­tices such as us­ing e-pay­ment meth­ods and shop­ping on­line.</p>
    <p>The IMDA also has a Home Ac­cess pro­gramme in which el­i­gi­ble house­holds re­ceive sub­si­dies for home In­ter­net ac­cess and tele­phone ser­vices with a broad­band pack­age and ba­sic com­put­ing equip­ment like a tablet.</p>
    <p>More than 14,000 low-in­come house­holds have ben­e­fited from this scheme since its launch in 2014, and IMDA aims to help 10,000 more over the next three years.</p>
    <p>The Gov­ern­ment will also reach out to new groups if more needs arise, though Mr Iswaran noted that it is not enough to just iden­tify tar­get groups and ini­ti­ate pro­grammes for them. At­ten­tion must be paid to their spe­cific needs, such as en­sur­ing that ma­te­ri­als for se­niors are avail­able in all four lan­guages or that of­fi­cers can speak in di­alect to hawk­ers.</p>
    <p>He said: “(It is also) about how you go about it... with in­dus­try part­ners, with com­mu­nity part­ners and with sen­si­tiv­ity to the needs of the seg­ments of... so­ci­ety we are reach­ing out to.”</p>
