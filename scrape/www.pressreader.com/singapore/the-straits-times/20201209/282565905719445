    <p>Would you get swabbed in the name of clas­si­cal mu­sic?</p>
    <p>For this pi­lot con­cert for a larger au­di­ence at the Es­planade’s Voices – A Fes­ti­val Of Song, all at­ten­dees had to un­dergo a Covid-19 anti­gen rapid test within 24 hours be­fore the show.</p>
    <p>The in­con­ve­nience of get­ting tested is sig­nif­i­cant, though for this re­viewer at least, the per­for­mance was worth the trou­ble.</p>
    <p>The con­cert opened with Ed­ward El­gar’s sym­phonic poem, In­tro­duc­tion And Al­le­gro For Strings, per­formed by 31 masked string play­ers from the Orches­tra of the Mu­sic Mak­ers (OMM).</p>
    <p>The string quar­tet per­formed ad­mirably with good en­sem­ble, with vi­o­lin­ist Chikako Sasaki pro­vid­ing steady lead­er­ship.</p>
    <p>OMM as­so­ciate con­duc­tor Seow Yibin di­rected a tidy, flow­ing per­for­mance of the piece. He gave the quar­tet space for ex­pres­sion, tak­ing care that the orches­tra did not over­whelm them.</p>
    <p>His di­rec­tion of El­gar’s ex­tended phrases and in­tri­cate fugue sec­tion was laud­able, although there was room for greater ex­u­ber­ance lead­ing to the fi­nale.</p>
    <p>The clos­ing pizzi­cato was slightly ten­ta­tive, but given the so­cial dis­tanc­ing among play­ers and limited prepa­ra­tion time avail­able for this project, the per­for­mance was a re­sound­ing suc­cess.</p>
    <p>The “voice” el­e­ment for this evening was Ben­jamin Brit­ten’s Ser­e­nade For Tenor, Horn And Strings. Tenor Jonathan Charles Tay and hor­nist Alexan­der Oon were well up to the de­mands of their parts.</p>
    <p>Oon’s open­ing solo was clear and played with great ac­cu­racy. As the work pro­ceeded, any early ten­ta­tive­ness dis­ap­peared and his con­fi­dence grew. He nailed Brit­ten’s high­est notes, hand stops and cuivre (brassy) sec­tions. Tay was full of con­fi­dence and drama from the start, main­tain­ing good dic­tion and ex­pres­sive­ness through­out.</p>
    <p>A max­i­mum of 431 peo­ple could have at­tended Satur­day’s con­cert, although the Es­planade de­clined to re­veal ac­tual at­ten­dance fig­ures.</p>
    <p>The big ques­tion was whether the test re­quire­ment might make in­ter­ested par­ties think twice, or even de­cide against at­tend­ing. The time needed to book a slot for the test, travel to the clinic, reg­is­ter, take the test and wait for the re­sult all adds up to at least an hour un­less the clinic hap­pens to be next door.</p>
    <p>With each re­sult valid for only 24 hours, the test win­dow is limited, es­pe­cially on week­days. Un­der this regime, sev­eral con­certs a month would mean mul­ti­ple tests and many ex­tra hours spent.</p>
    <p>Are even our most ar­dent mu­sic lovers up to this? Only time can tell. But this re­viewer is not likely to at­tend an­other con­cert with manda­tory test­ing for some time.</p>
