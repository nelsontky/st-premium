    <p>Trans­port Min­is­ter Ong Ye Kung yes­ter­day took to his so­cial me­dia ac­counts to ex­press his grat­i­tude to bus driv­ers and de­nounce pas­sen­gers who abuse them.</p>
    <p>He wrote on his Face­book and In­sta­gram pages: “We may live in un­cer­tain times due to Covid-19 but that is no ex­cuse for any­one to phys­i­cally or ver­bally abuse fel­low hu­man be­ings who are per­form­ing their du­ties. The last thing we need on a bus is an un­co­op­er­a­tive and abu­sive pas­sen­ger.</p>
    <p>“Gra­cious­ness is the cor­ner­stone of a car­ing so­ci­ety. Let’s be there for our bus un­cles and aun­ties.”</p>
    <p>Mr Ong added that bus driv­ers start their days as early as 4am. “They sin­gle-hand­edly com­mand and steer a bus, in a timely and safe man­ner. They send the youngest to oldest in our house­holds to school, work, mar­ket and er­rands,” he wrote.</p>
    <p>The post comes four days af­ter a Face­book user posted a video of him­self ver­bally abus­ing a bus driver who would not let him board a pub­lic bus wear­ing a neck gaiter in­stead of a face mask.</p>
    <p>In the 15-minute live video, Mr Ni­mal De Silva is heard com­ment­ing on the in­ci­dent while the driver is seek­ing help. The pas­sen­ger is also seen re­ject­ing an of­fer of a mask from an­other pas­sen­ger.</p>
    <p>The video ends with the po­lice speak­ing to the man and the bus driver.</p>
    <p>The po­lice said they were alerted to a case of in­ten­tional ha­rass­ment against a pub­lic ser­vice worker and pub­lic nui­sance along Ni­coll High­way at 6pm last Wed­nes­day.</p>
    <p>The case is still un­der in­ves­ti­ga­tion.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to the Covid-19 (Tem­po­rary Mea­sures) Act, a “mask” in­cludes any pa­per or tex­tile cov­er­ing de­signed or made to be worn over the nose and mouth to pro­vide the wearer pro­tec­tion against in­fec­tions or air pol­lu­tion, but ex­cludes a face shield.</p>
    <p>Lawyer Ra­jan Supra­ma­niam, re­spond­ing to queries from The Straits Times, said: “The Min­istry of Health (MOH) should pro­vide clearer guide­lines on whether neck gaiters, as well as other cloth items such as hand­ker­chiefs and scarves, can be used as a sub­sti­tute for face masks, to en­lighten the pub­lic.</p>
    <p>“It is also for the ben­e­fit of the po­lice to know what is ac­cept­able so they can en­force the rules with­out am­bi­gu­ity.”</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to the MOH web­site, “a mask that closely and com­pletely cov­ers the nose and mouth (that is, with­out leav­ing a gap be­tween the mask and the face)” must be worn when peo­ple go out of their homes.</p>
    <p>When con­tacted, a min­istry spokesman said: “MOH does not rec­om­mend the use of neck gaiters and ban­danas as masks.”</p>
