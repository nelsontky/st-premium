    <p>OR­LANDO (Florida) • There is lit­tle love lost be­tween the Philadel­phia 76ers and the Bos­ton Celtics. They have met each other more times (20) in the post-sea­son than any other match-up and it is the long­est ri­valry in the Na­tional Bas­ket­ball As­so­ci­a­tion, go­ing back to 1949.</p>
    <p>The Six­ers and Celtics will go at it again, meet­ing in the play-offs for the sec­ond time in the past three years, after Bos­ton’s third seed­ing in the Eastern Con­fer­ence and Philadel­phia’s spot as the sixth seed was fi­nalised on Wed­nes­day.</p>
    <p>Not since 2002 are both teams clash­ing this early in the first round next week and while the Six­ers had the bet­ter of their reg­u­lar sea­son match-ups, win­ning three of the four games, few ex­pect the same dom­i­nance this time round.</p>
    <p>Much of it has to do with the sea­son-end­ing in­jury suf­fered by their guard Ben Sim­mons. The two-time All-Star un­der­went surgery on Mon­day to cor­rect a dis­lo­cated knee cap and his game av­er­age of 16.4 points, 8.0 as­sists and 7.8 re­bounds will be sorely missed.</p>
    <p>Prior to his in­jury, the Aus­tralian guard also led his team for the most num­ber of min­utes played at 35.4 per game, and 76ers coach Brett Brown has ad­mit­ted they will have to some­how shut down the Celtics’ perime­ter threats with­out their pri­mary de­fen­sive as­set.</p>
    <p>The glar­ing hole was ob­vi­ous as the Six­ers fell to their third straight de­feat, los­ing 125-121 to cham­pi­ons Toronto Rap­tors on Wed­nes­day.</p>
    <p>On go­ing 3-4 in the “bub­ble” and now shorn of Sim­mons, Brown told MassLive.com: “Ben was hav­ing an All-De­fen­sive type of sea­son.</p>
    <p>“When you take that weapon out, that length out, that ver­sa­til­ity out, there’s more re­spon­si­bil­ity on ev­ery­one, es­pe­cially Joel (Em­biid).</p>
    <p>“I feel like his rim pro­tec­tion, him be­ing such a pres­ence at the rim, look­ing to block shots, look­ing for de­fen­sive re­bounds... is go­ing to be even more re­quired... we need him to go to a higher level.”</p>
    <p>But Em­biid has also been strug­gling with in­jury since the league moved to Dis­ney World. In their</p>
    <p>PICK­ING UP THE SLACK</p>
    <p>When you take that weapon out, that length out, that ver­sa­til­ity out, there’s more re­spon­si­bil­ity on ev­ery­one, es­pe­cially Joel (Em­biid).</p>
    <p>’’</p>
    <p>BRETT BROWN, Philadel­phia 76ers coach, calls on his team to raise their game after los­ing guard Ben Sim­mons to a knee in­jury.</p>
    <p>past three games, the cen­tre has sat out one game and played a com­bined 20 min­utes in the other two.</p>
    <p>How­ever, Six­ers for­ward Al Hor­ford does not want to use that as an ex­cuse as his team open their bid to make it to the Eastern Fi­nals for the first time in 19 years and ul­ti­mately, a first ti­tle since 1983.</p>
    <p>The five-time All-Star will be fac­ing his for­mer team, whom he left last year. He told USA To­day: “Com­ing into the bub­ble, we knew it was a pos­si­bil­ity. For us, it’s a great op­por­tu­nity. It’s part of the busi­ness.</p>
    <p>“Ob­vi­ously, we’ve al­ready played them plenty of times this year so that ef­fect is out of the way so now we can go out there and com­pete and it should be a fun series.”</p>
    <p>Get­ting beaten 4-1 by Bos­ton in the 2018 Eastern semi-fi­nals still stings for Brown and he is hop­ing the mem­ory of that series loss will in­spire his play­ers, even though they are not at full strength.</p>
    <p>“The Philly-Celtics ri­valry is sto­ried,” he said. “It’s his­toric and so to be able to have this op­por­tu­nity again we’re ex­cited, (we’ll) treat this series with tremen­dous re­spect but it’s one that we’re ex­cited to com­pete against them.”</p>
    <p>Bos­ton for­ward Jayson Ta­tum said on Tues­day: “We just con­tinue to get bet­ter each and ev­ery game, and that’s what you want this time of the year.”</p>
