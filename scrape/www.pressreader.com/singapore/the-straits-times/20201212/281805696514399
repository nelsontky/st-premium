    <p>The roll-out of Covid-19 vac­ci­na­tion in the US, ex­pected within days, will not be a quick shot in the arm for the pub­lic at large.</p>
    <p>It will be months – and po­ten­tially only around June next year – be­fore life re­turns to a pre-pan­demic nor­mal.</p>
    <p>Essen­tially, vac­ci­na­tion and the pan­demic will run side by side till then – and on cur­rent trends, the daily death toll will re­main high.</p>
    <p>The United States passed a grim mile­stone on Wed­nes­day, with the death toll for the first time sur­pass­ing 3,000 in a sin­gle day.</p>
    <p>The coro­n­avirus will kill more peo­ple in the US ev­ery day for the next two to three months than the num­bers who died in the Sept 11, 2001 or Pearl Har­bour at­tacks, Cen­tres for Dis­ease Con­trol and</p>
    <p>Preven­tion di­rec­tor Robert Red­field warned on Thurs­day.</p>
    <p>Sep­a­rately, the coun­try’s top epi­demi­ol­o­gist An­thony Fauci told CNN: “If we have a smooth vac­ci­na­tion pro­gramme where ev­ery­body steps to the plate quickly, we could get back to some form of nor­mal­ity, rea­son­ably quickly.</p>
    <p>“Into the sum­mer, and cer­tainly into the fall.”</p>
    <p>Health and Hu­man Ser­vices Sec­re­tary Alex Azar said that at least 20 mil­lion Amer­i­cans will be able to be vac­ci­nated by the end of the month, and 50 mil­lion by the end of next month. At least 100 mil­lion should be vac­ci­nated by the end of the first quar­ter of next year.</p>
    <p>“We re­main con­fi­dent that across our port­fo­lio of mul­ti­ple vac­cines, we will have enough doses for any Amer­i­can who wants a vac­cine by the end of the sec­ond quar­ter of 2021,” Mr Azar added.</p>
    <p>The Food and Drug Ad­min­is­tra­tion (FDA) is ex­pected to au­tho­rise emer­gency use of Pfizer’s vac­cine, de­vel­oped with its Ger­man part­ner BioNTech, by this week­end.</p>
    <p>The agency’s ad­vi­sory panel on Thurs­day agreed by a vote of 17 to four, with one ab­sten­tion, that the vac­cine can be used for ages 16 and up. The “no” votes came only on wor­ries of in­suf­fi­cient data for ages 16 and 17.</p>
    <p>The FDA will go through the same ex­er­cise next week for a vac­cine from Moderna.</p>
    <p>Both vac­cines have shown over 90 per cent ef­fi­cacy in tri­als.</p>
    <p>The vac­cines will be ad­min­is­tered in phases, be­gin­ning with front-line health­care work­ers. Dif­fer­ent states and in­sti­tu­tions have their own plans – and face sig­nif­i­cant is­sues.</p>
    <p>One of the big­gest is­sues is that the vac­cines need to be stored and trans­ported at very cold tem­per­a­tures. Also, two doses are re­quired for each vac­cine, spaced ei­ther 21 or 28 days apart.</p>
    <p>Pfizer-BioNTech’s vac­cine needs to be stored at mi­nus</p>
    <p>70 deg C. It is vi­able for only five days in stan­dard re­frig­er­a­tion and six hours at room tem­per­a­ture.</p>
    <p>Pre­par­ing the vac­cines for ad­min­is­tra­tion is a multi-step process as well, re­quir­ing thaw time, re­con­sti­tu­tion, and draw­ing into the sy­ringe.</p>
    <p>“We need to get 70 per cent of the pop­u­la­tion vac­ci­nated – that is hun­dreds of mil­lions of doses,” Cal­i­for­nia-based in­ter­nal medicine doc­tor Shoshana Unger­lei­der told The Straits Times.</p>
    <p>“We’re a long way off still from nor­malcy in this coun­try.”</p>
    <p>Ex­perts are also wor­ried that sig­nif­i­cant num­bers of Amer­i­cans may refuse to take the vac­cine. A small anti-vac­cine move­ment blamed for measles out­breaks has most likely grown.</p>
    <p>“Anec­do­tally, un­for­tu­nately, the Don­ald Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion has al­lowed mis­in­for­ma­tion to run ram­pant,” Dr Unger­lei­der said.</p>
    <p>“The en­tire pub­lic health and sci­ence com­mu­nity is dis­mayed at this. It has set sci­ence back 30 years, and at the worst pos­si­ble time.</p>
    <p>“There needs to be a pretty ro­bust pub­lic health mes­sag­ing cam­paign, which should have hap­pened months ago, around the fact that th­ese vac­cines were de­vel­oped (in an) in­de­pen­dent process that un­der­goes ut­most scru­tiny for safety.</p>
    <p>“The vac­cine is not go­ing to be a magic bul­let, un­for­tu­nately. Peo­ple still need to be mask­ing, avoid­ing in­door gath­er­ings, and be in well-ven­ti­lated ar­eas.”</p>
