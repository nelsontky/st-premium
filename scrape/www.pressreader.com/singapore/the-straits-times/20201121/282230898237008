    <p>Singtel is warn­ing the pub­lic to be wary of scam calls, say­ing that such calls have dou­bled from last year.</p>
    <p>A Singtel spokesman said yes­ter­day that its cus­tomers have re­ceived more than 5,000 calls so far this year, with call­ers im­per­son­at­ing Singtel cus­tomer and tech­ni­cal sup­port of­fi­cers. Of these, tech sup­port scams about the ter­mi­na­tion of Singtel ser­vices were the most com­mon, mak­ing up about 10 per cent of the scam calls, said Singtel.</p>
    <p>The num­ber re­flects only scams that were re­ported to Singtel, the big­gest mo­bile telco here, with about 50 per cent of the mar­ket share.</p>
    <p>Among the other tel­cos, M1 said yes­ter­day that although it does re­ceive such re­ports from cus­tomers, the com­pany has not seen a sig­nif­i­cant in­crease in cases year on year. How­ever, it warned its cus­tomers to pro­tect them­selves by block­ing un­known spam call num­bers on their phones.</p>
    <p>StarHub as­sis­tant vice-pres­i­dent for cor­po­rate com­mu­ni­ca­tions Cassie Fong also said yes­ter­day that the telco is aware of the rise in dig­i­tal scams, which have be­come “very com­mon in the dig­i­tal age”.</p>
    <p>She urged cus­tomers to stay vig­i­lant and be aware that such scams can come in many forms – e-mails, SMSes, tweets, In­ter­net browser pop-ups and on­line ads.</p>
    <p>To help its cus­tomers recog­nise the tell-tale signs of a scam, Singtel launched a “Jaga (guard) your data” scam aware­ness cam­paign yes­ter­day. The cam­paign com­prises three short films, each play­ing out a tel­core­lated scam sce­nario.</p>
    <p>Ms Lian Pek, vice-pres­i­dent of group strate­gic com­mu­ni­ca­tions and brand at Singtel, said: “It’s un­for­tu­nate that on­go­ing scams us­ing the Singtel name or that of other com­pa­nies have been so per­va­sive and that many peo­ple have be­come the tar­gets of trick­sters im­per­son­at­ing our tech­ni­cians and cus­tomer ser­vice of­fi­cers.</p>
    <p>“By serv­ing up anti-scam ad­vice and lessons with a dash of hu­mour with the aim of mak­ing the mes­sages stick, we hope to foil some of these scam­mers’ ef­forts by en­cour­ag­ing Sin­ga­pore­ans to stay vig­i­lant to pro­tect them­selves and their fam­i­lies.”</p>
    <p>Sep­a­rately, the In­land Rev­enue Au­thor­ity of Sin­ga­pore (Iras) warned the pub­lic to be wary of a scam e-mail, ti­tled “Coro­n­avirus Tax Re­lief and Eco­nomic Im­pact Pay­ments”.</p>
    <p>The e-mail, pur­port­edly sent by Iras, claims to of­fer a new Covid-19 tax re­lief for busi­nesses and in­di­vid­u­als af­fected by the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Those who have re­sponded and shared their per­sonal or fi­nan­cial in­for­ma­tion with the senders are ad­vised to lodge a po­lice re­port.</p>
