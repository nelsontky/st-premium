    <p>When it came to qual­ity of teacher-child in­ter­ac­tions, the Sin­ga­pore Kin­der­garten Im­pact Project (Skip) found that pre-school teach­ers pro­vided good emo­tional sup­port to their young charges and held well-or­gan­ised classes.</p>
    <p>How­ever, the study found that the qual­ity of teacher-child in­ter­ac­tions that stim­u­late chil­dren’s think­ing and lan­guage skills can be im­proved. The team sug­gested that this can be done through con­tin­u­ing pro­fes­sional de­vel­op­ment of pre-school teach­ers.</p>
    <p>Of the 163 teach­ers who gave in­for­ma­tion on their qual­i­fi­ca­tions, 22 per cent were de­gree hold­ers in early child­hood ed­u­ca­tion, while the re­main­ing were mostly diploma hold­ers in the field.</p>
    <p>“In early child­hood ed­u­ca­tion, it is im­por­tant to pro­vide the right en­vi­ron­ment for learn­ing,” said the Na­tional In­sti­tute of Ed­u­ca­tion’s Dr Ng Ee Lynn, the prin­ci­pal in­ves­ti­ga­tor of the study.</p>
    <p>She said the study found that pre-school ed­u­ca­tors here pro­vided sup­port for chil­dren to have au­ton­omy in their learn­ing and a warm learn­ing en­vi­ron­ment, which was sen­si­tive to chil­dren’s needs.</p>
    <p>Teach­ers also pro­vided con­sis­tent daily rou­tines, and used dif­fer­ent learn­ing re­sources and ma­te­ri­als.</p>
    <p>Dr Ng said the find­ing on the qual­ity of in­struc­tional sup­port should be in­ves­ti­gated fur­ther, as many stud­ies in the United States, Europe and China also re­vealed gaps in the qual­ity of teacher­child in­ter­ac­tions: “In sim­i­lar stud­ies around the world, teach­ers scored bet­ter in pro­vid­ing the right en­vi­ron­ment than qual­ity of their in­struc­tional sup­port.”</p>
    <p>In­struc­tional sup­port fo­cuses on teach­ers’ use of ef­fec­tive strate­gies to im­prove chil­dren’s higher-or­der think­ing, and lan­guage skills. The qual­ity of in­ter­ac­tion was as­sessed by ob­serv­ing how the teacher worked with chil­dren in a typ­i­cal school day, once at K1 and again at K2.</p>
    <p>The Skip team used the find­ings to de­velop tools and re­sources with the aim of rais­ing the qual­ity of teach­ing and learn­ing in the pre-school sec­tor in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>For ex­am­ple, based on the study’s find­ings on in­struc­tional sup­port, the Skip pro­fes­sional de­vel­op­ment project team has de­vel­oped train­ing videos and re­sources to im­prove teacher-child in­ter­ac­tions in the pre-school class­rooms.</p>
    <p>Dr Ng said in fu­ture stud­ies, the team would like to in­clude a wider range of kinder­gartens to see if qual­ity pre-school ed­u­ca­tion, for ex­am­ple those which em­ploy only de­gree hold­ers as teach­ers or have smaller class sizes, can make a dif­fer­ence.</p>
    <p>In the study which just con­cluded, Skip fo­cused on kinder­gartens with a sim­i­lar fee range for com­pa­ra­bil­ity. They in­cluded childcare cen­tres, an­chor op­er­a­tor and non-an­chor op­er­a­tor kinder­gartens and Min­istry of Ed­u­ca­tion kinder­gartens.</p>
