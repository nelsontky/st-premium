    <p>Plenty of peo­ple and com­pa­nies are ad­vo­cat­ing a green agenda these days, but en­tre­pre­neur Justin Chou be­lieves in putting his money where his mouth is when it comes to en­sur­ing a more sus­tain­able earth.</p>
    <p>He was so com­mit­ted to his mis­sion that he ditched his univer­sity stud­ies to pur­sue en­trepreneur­ship.</p>
    <p>He said: “I was lucky to dis­cover my pas­sion and mis­sion in life at a rel­a­tively early age.</p>
    <p>“In­stead of fo­cus­ing on de­grees and job prospects, I want to fo­cus on cre­at­ing an im­pact in the world by help­ing lives go green.”</p>
    <p>Mr Chou, 31, co-founded plant­based eatery Green­dot in 2011. It now has 14 restau­rants and 200 em­ploy­ees here.</p>
    <p>The firm now has an an­nual rev­enue of around US$10 mil­lion (S$13.6 mil­lion).</p>
    <p>The busi­ness started out as a hawker stall at Te­masek Poly­tech­nic and took two to three years of fine-tun­ing be­fore branch­ing out into shop­ping malls.</p>
    <p>Mr Chou said: “Dur­ing Covid-19, the busi­ness dipped slightly in the first two months due to the move­ment re­stric­tions in both Sin­ga­pore and Malaysia, as well as the cross­bor­der sup­ply chain.</p>
    <p>“The busi­ness then saw a steady pick-up due to the stronger de­mand for meat and seafood al­ter­na­tives amongst con­sumers.</p>
    <p>“Now that we are in phase two and cross-border truck­ing has been re­in­stated, we are back to meet­ing our cus­tomers’ de­mands.”</p>
    <p>Be­sides the food and bev­er­age busi­ness, Mr Chou also co-founded agri-tech start-up Glife Tech­nolo­gies in 2017.</p>
    <p>The firm aims to pro­vide fresh pro­duce di­rectly from farms to cus­tomers.</p>
    <p>It dis­trib­utes to around 600 cus­tomers in the hos­pi­tal­ity sec­tor here, em­ploys about 70 staff and has an an­nual rev­enue of around US$10 mil­lion.</p>
    <p>Mr Chou’s de­sire to con­trib­ute to a greener so­ci­ety is also aligned with his de­ci­sion to join the family busi­ness in 2018.</p>
    <p>The firm – Growth­well Group – is a tra­di­tional veg­e­tar­ian, plant­based man­u­fac­turer that also uses meat al­ter­na­tives. It aims to trans­form Asia’s plant nu­tri­tion and now has about 80 em­ploy­ees.</p>
    <p>“I am ex­tremely grate­ful that my par­ents have given me a solid foun­da­tion not only in busi­ness, but core val­ues as a hu­man be­ing,” he said.</p>
    <p>“I am merely ex­tend­ing my creativ­ity and pas­sion to in­no­vate the family busi­ness. I look for­ward to trail-blaz­ing the food and agri­cul­tural tech space, to tackle food sus­tain­abil­ity and se­cu­rity is­sues in Asia and ul­ti­mately bring­ing health­ier and tastier plant-based food solutions to mil­lions of peo­ple.”</p>
    <p>He also has plans to de­velop the Growth­well Group.</p>
    <p>“The next stage is in in­te­grat­ing the full value chain of the plant­based and meat-al­ter­na­tive sup­ply chain, to en­sure it goes from farm to in­gre­di­ents to man­u­fac­tur­ing to dis­tri­bu­tion to retail and to e-com­merce.”</p>
    <p>Mr Chou is mar­ried to a 33-yearold part-time pre-school teacher, and they have a two-year-old son.</p>
    <p>Q What’s in your port­fo­lio?</p>
    <p>A I in­vest only in busi­nesses that are syn­er­gis­tic and aligned to the core val­ues and vi­sion of the family busi­ness, such as ChickP, which is a start-up in Is­rael.</p>
    <p>ChickP will be de­vel­op­ing in­no­va­tive plant pro­teins to launch the world’s first 90 per cent chick­pea pro­tein iso­late spe­cially de­signed for plant-based dairy and meat al­ter­na­tives through patent-pend­ing tech­nol­ogy.</p>
    <p>This in­vest­ment em­bod­ies what I be­lieve in – an in­ten­tion to make the world a bet­ter place by pro­vid­ing end-to-end plant-based food solutions for 100 mil­lion lives while re­duc­ing the world’s over­all meat con­sump­tion.</p>
    <p>Q What are your im­me­di­ate in­vest­ment plans?</p>
    <p>A I am look­ing for ex­cit­ing and syn­er­gis­tic agri-tech and food tech start-ups to in­vest in.</p>
    <p>How I choose which busi­ness to in­vest in is based on how pas­sion­ate it is in its work, as well as the founder’s in­tegrity, as that is a foun­da­tional part of any work.</p>
    <p>The busi­nesses must also have deep-tech ca­pa­bil­ity to sus­tain­ably re­think the cur­rent food sys­tem while meet­ing the growing de­mand for food.</p>
    <p>This part is cru­cial as we move closer to a hu­man pop­u­la­tion of 10 bil­lion, which threat­ens the nat­u­ral global sup­ply of food and nu­tri­tion.</p>
    <p>Q How did you get in­ter­ested in in­vest­ing?</p>
    <p>A It was dur­ing a busi­ness trip op­por­tu­nity to Is­rael led by the former chair­man of what was for­merly known as the Agri-Food and Vet­eri­nary Au­thor­ity of Sin­ga­pore to ex­plore the food tech ecosys­tem in start-up na­tion Is­rael.</p>
    <p>It was a learn­ing jour­ney and also a trip that opened my eyes to in­no­va­tion in food and agri­cul­ture.</p>
    <p>Q De­scribe your in­vest­ing strat­egy.</p>
    <p>A I in­vest in the founder and man­age­ment team of busi­nesses and in the race that the start-up is in. I also in­vest in spa­ces that I am fa­mil­iar with, such as food and agri­cul­ture.</p>
    <p>Q How are you plan­ning for re­tire­ment?</p>
    <p>A I’m only 31, so re­tire­ment is still re­ally far away at the mo­ment. I have not planned for re­tire­ment. Per­haps, I might never re­tire.</p>
    <p>Q Money­wise, what were your growing-up years like?</p>
    <p>A My fa­ther Chou Shih Hsin is now 63 and my mother Re­becca Lee is 59. I have a brother, Colin, 29. All of us are in the family busi­ness.</p>
    <p>My fa­ther is the man­ag­ing di­rec­tor of Growth­well Group and my mother is the ex­ec­u­tive di­rec­tor of Green­dot Group.</p>
    <p>My brother is the com­mer­cial di­rec­tor of Growth­well Group.</p>
    <p>The family lifestyle was al­ways pru­dent, down to earth and spir­i­tual.</p>
    <p>When I was young, my family had a huge bun­ga­low.</p>
    <p>My dad sold the bun­ga­low and do­nated most of the pro­ceeds (in mil­lions) to a tem­ple.</p>
    <p>I asked my dad: “Why? Why not keep it for our­selves?”</p>
    <p>He told me in Man­darin: “It is un­nec­es­sary to be cal­cu­la­tive about the good deeds or char­ity that you do. The virtue is in giv­ing, and it is more blessed to be able to give than to re­ceive.”</p>
    <p>Q What does money mean to you?</p>
    <p>A Money means cap­i­tal and that leads to re­spon­si­bil­ity.</p>
    <p>The more money you have, the more so­cial re­spon­si­bil­ity you have to do good. One has no need for riches in the grave. When alive, re­sources are given to you be­cause you have a mis­sion to ful­fil in life.</p>
    <p>For me, my mis­sion is to in­flu­ence a bil­lion lives to go green and to feed a hun­dred mil­lion peo­ple with plant-based food.</p>
    <p>Q Home is now...</p>
    <p>A A five-room Build-to-Or­der flat in Sky­peak @ Bukit Ba­tok.</p>
    <p>Q I drive...</p>
    <p>A I drive a Toy­ota Pre­via, a sev­enseater multi-pur­pose ve­hi­cle, which is pearl white in colour.</p>
