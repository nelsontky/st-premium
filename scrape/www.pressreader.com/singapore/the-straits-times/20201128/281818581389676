    <p>NEW YORK • Amer­i­cans marked a muted Thanks­giv­ing Day hol­i­day on Thurs­day, with some see­ing their fam­ily by video after po­lit­i­cal lead­ers dis­cour­aged travel or large gath­er­ings in the face of the surg­ing coro­n­avirus pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Thanks­giv­ing, nor­mally a day for fam­ily and friends to gather to feast on turkey and pump­kin pie and re­mem­ber life’s bless­ings, has been up­ended this year by the virus, with most states strug­gling to cope amid spi­ralling in­fec­tions and deaths.</p>
    <p>“All of a sud­den I feel kind of lonely, I have to ad­mit,” said Ms Ja­nis Se­gal, 72, as she pre­pared to join fam­ily mem­bers in a Zoom call for Thanks­giv­ing.</p>
    <p>Eight months after Covid-19 erupted across the United States, most ma­jor cities re­main un­der strict rules im­posed by state and lo­cal of­fi­cials re­strict­ing pub­lic gath­er­ings, clos­ing busi­nesses and ban­ning in­door din­ing at restau­rants.</p>
    <p>The tra­di­tional Macy’s Thanks­giv­ing Day Pa­rade in New York, a spec­ta­cle of gi­ant char­ac­ter bal­loons that has de­lighted chil­dren for nearly a cen­tury, was scaled back sig­nif­i­cantly.</p>
    <p>The route was re­duced to one block, rather than 4km, bal­loon han­dlers were re­placed by spe­cially rigged ve­hi­cles, and spec­ta­tors were pro­hib­ited from lin­ing the streets as be­fore.</p>
    <p>The event ended at noon after three hours of per­for­mances and floats, fea­tur­ing stars in­clud­ing Dolly Par­ton, and a four-storey-tall Snoopy in as­tro­naut gear – all with­out the usual mil­lions crowd­ing the streets to watch.</p>
    <p>The hol­i­day is be­ing cel­e­brated at a time of se­vere eco­nomic strain for mil­lions of Amer­i­cans. More than 20 mil­lion peo­ple are re­ceiv­ing some form of un­em­ploy­ment ben­e­fits, and a fresh wave of lay­offs is ex­pected.</p>
    <p>Ms Asia Fore­man, who re­cently founded a non-profit with her sis­ter to raise aware­ness about men­tal health is­sues, was work­ing on Thurs­day af­ter­noon to fin­ish de­liv­er­ing 500 plates of chicken, mac­a­roni and cheese, yams and greens in Washington.</p>
    <p>“We wanted to feed as many peo­ple as pos­si­ble, so turkey wasn’t in the bud­get,” she said, adding that many in her com­mu­nity were strug­gling to make ends meet.</p>
    <p>US hos­pi­tal­i­sa­tions for Covid-19 reached a record of more than 89,000 on Wed­nes­day, and ex­perts warn Thanks­giv­ing could lead to a spike in cases and sig­nif­i­cantly boost a death toll that has ex­ceeded 262,000 na­tion­wide.</p>
    <p>De­spite of­fi­cial ad­vice to stay home for the hol­i­day, nearly six mil­lion Amer­i­cans trav­elled by air from last Friday to Wed­nes­day.</p>
    <p>Many Amer­i­cans have not seen their loved ones for months and, for them, the an­nual get-to­gether is im­por­tant enough to out­weigh the pos­si­ble risks of get­ting the coro­n­avirus.</p>
    <p>Nearly 40 per cent plan to at­tend a “risky gath­er­ing” dur­ing the hol­i­days, ei­ther in ex­cess of 10 or with peo­ple out­side their house­hold, ac­cord­ing to a na­tional sur­vey.</p>
    <p>Many oth­ers, how­ever, have can­celled their travel plans and will in­stead con­nect with loved ones over Face­Time or Zoom.</p>
    <p>Ms Mar­garet Bullard, a pub­lic de­fender in At­lanta, said she and her hus­band have taken ev­ery pre­cau­tion since the on­set of the pan­demic, which came soon after the birth of her nine-month-old son.</p>
    <p>They drove from their home in Ge­or­gia to North Carolina to spend Thanks­giv­ing with her in-laws.</p>
    <p>“As much as we would like to see some other fam­ily mem­bers, we know that we would be tak­ing a much big­ger risk by do­ing so,” said Ms Bullard, who is co-ad­min­is­tra­tor of a Face­book group for “Covid­con­scious” Ge­or­gians.</p>
    <p>“There will be plenty of op­por­tu­ni­ties for get-to­geth­ers in the fu­ture if we all do what we can to stay safe.”</p>
