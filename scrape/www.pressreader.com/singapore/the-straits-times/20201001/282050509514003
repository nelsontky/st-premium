    <p>In the first move of its kind here, SMRT Taxis will re­place its mo­bile dis­play ter­mi­nals used by cab­bies to ac­cept jobs with a Grab Driver app.</p>
    <p>The move starts to­day and the app will be rolled out fleetwide by the end of the year, SMRT and Grab said in a joint state­ment yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The app en­ables SMRT driv­ers to man­age earn­ings and re­ceive jobs from across SMRT’s ex­ist­ing book­ing sys­tem, street hail and the Grab plat­form. It also re­moves the need for cab­bies to tog­gle be­tween their phone and the taxi’s mo­bile dis­play ter­mi­nal.</p>
    <p>With the app, taxi driv­ers can start their taxi me­ter when they opt for street hail jobs and con­trol their rooftop sign when they have pas­sen­gers on board.</p>
    <p>SMRT pas­sen­gers who make phone book­ings can also ex­pect shorter wait­ing times for their driv­ers, as their book­ings will be al­lo­cated with the up­dated map­ping tools and ride op­ti­mi­sa­tion features that the Grab plat­form of­fers.</p>
    <p>The en­hanced app was jointly de­vel­oped by SMRT and Grab.</p>
    <p>SMRT Roads pres­i­dent Tan Kian Heong said: “We have been work­ing with Grab on this project for a year now. This new sys­tem will seam­lessly in­te­grate Grab’s driver app with our street hail sys­tem, pro­vid­ing con­ve­nience and more job op­por­tu­ni­ties to our taxi part­ners.”</p>
    <p>Grab said it has also de­signed and de­vel­oped a Web-based fleet op­er­a­tions plat­form “from ground up” to stream­line SMRT’s opera­tional needs. With this, SMRT is able to su­per­vise and con­trol the en­tire dispatch and fleet op­er­a­tions from a cen­tral por­tal ef­fi­ciently.</p>
    <p>The Web por­tal also en­ables SMRT op­er­a­tions of­fi­cers to reg­is­ter new ve­hi­cles in the fleet, or sus­pend er­rant driv­ers and cus­tomers quickly if re­quired. They will also be able to track book­ings in real time and send in-app no­ti­fi­ca­tions to driv­ers if there are any im­por­tant an­nounce­ments.</p>
    <p>SMRT, the third-largest cab op­er­a­tor here, has also set up a ded­i­cated cloud-based in­fra­struc­ture to en­sure “an op­ti­mal ex­pe­ri­ence for its driv­ers and op­er­a­tions team”.</p>
    <p>Grab said it rolled out more than one tech im­prove­ment to its own trans­port plat­form each week on av­er­age last year.</p>
