    <p>This year’s Re­pub­li­can Na­tional Con­ven­tion and Demo­cratic Na­tional Con­ven­tion will be much smaller af­fairs com­pared with the big, arena-based ral­lies of pre­vi­ous years, with fewer in-per­son at­ten­dees to com­ply with so­cial dis­tanc­ing re­stric­tions.</p>
    <p>In or­di­nary times, tens of thou­sands of po­lit­i­cal del­e­gates and jour­nal­ists would by now be stream­ing into Mil­wau­kee, Wis­con­sin, for the Demo­cratic Na­tional Con­ven­tion (DNC), which will take place from to­day to Thursday.</p>
    <p>But this year’s party con­ven­tions, in­clud­ing the Re­pub­li­can Na­tional Con­ven­tion (RNC) in Char­lotte, North Carolina, next week, will be much smaller af­fairs, with fewer in­per­son at­ten­dees to com­ply with so­cial dis­tanc­ing re­stric­tions. In­stead of big, arena-based ral­lies with thou­sands of peo­ple cheer­ing and wav­ing signs, the DNC will be largely vir­tual and streamed live on­line, with about two hours of speeches from po­lit­i­cal stars each night.</p>
    <p>Even Demo­cratic nom­i­nee Joe Bi­den and his run­ning mate Ka­mala Har­ris will ap­pear on a screen in­stead of in per­son, giv­ing their speeches from a con­ven­tion cen­tre in Delaware, Mr Bi­den’s home state.</p>
    <p>A ma­jor high­light of the pres­i­den­tial elec­tion cy­cle, these party con­ven­tions are where party del­e­gates make of­fi­cial their choice of who to run on the bal­lot in Novem­ber’s gen­eral elec­tion, as well as a me­dia ex­trav­a­ganza to drum up sup­port and mo­bilise vot­ers.</p>
    <p>Mr Bi­den will on Thursday – the DNC’s fi­nal night – of­fi­cially ac­cept the Demo­cratic Party’s nom­i­na­tion to ap­pear on the bal­lot in Novem­ber, run­ning against Re­pub­li­can in­cum­bent Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump.</p>
    <p>Other speak­ers who will take the stage over the four nights in­clude for­mer pres­i­dent and first lady Barack and Michelle Obama; 2016 Demo­cratic nom­i­nee Hil­lary Clin­ton and her hus­band, for­mer pres­i­dent Bill Clin­ton; for­mer pres­i­den­tial hope­fuls Bernie San­ders and El­iz­a­beth War­ren; and lib­eral con­gress­woman Alexan­dria Oca­sio-Cortez.</p>
    <p>Na­tional con­ven­tions sig­nal the end of the pri­mary sea­son and the be­gin­ning of can­di­dates reach­ing out be­yond the party faith­ful to gen­eral elec­tion vot­ers, who tend to be more mod­er­ate and po­ten­tial swing vot­ers, said Uni­ver­sity of North Carolina at Char­lotte po­lit­i­cal sci­en­tist Eric Heberlig.</p>
    <p>“It’s the way the party’s go­ing to in­tro­duce its can­di­date to the gen­eral elec­tion vot­ers, in­tro­duce their cam­paign themes, in­tro­duce their is­sue pri­or­i­ties in hopes that they can per­suade vot­ers through the fall cam­paign to vote for them in the elec­tion,” said Prof Heberlig, co-au­thor of a book ti­tled Amer­i­can Cities And The Pol­i­tics Of Party Con­ven­tions.</p>
    <p>The pro­gramme for the RNC, which takes place from Aug 24 to 27, has not yet been fi­nalised.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump’s for­mal nom­i­na­tion will be on Aug 24, and he said last week that he would give his ac­cep­tance speech from the White House.</p>
    <p>The an­nounce­ment drew crit­i­cism that the na­tion’s high­est of­fice was be­ing used for overtly par­ti­san ac­tiv­ity.</p>
    <p>The Pres­i­dent had pre­vi­ously also floated the idea of de­liv­er­ing his speech from the his­toric site of the 1863 Bat­tle of Get­tys­burg in Penn­syl­va­nia, the blood­i­est bat­tle and turn­ing point of the United States Civil War.</p>
    <p>The RNC was orig­i­nally sup­posed to take place en­tirely in Char­lotte, but North Carolina’s Demo­cratic Gov­er­nor Roy Cooper de­clined to re­lax the state’s so­cial dis­tanc­ing rules to al­low a full con­ven­tion hall and no face cov­er­ings at the Trump cam­paign’s re­quest.</p>
    <p>In re­sponse, Mr Trump moved the con­ven­tion’s main events to Jack­sonville, Florida, but late last month, he can­celled plans there as the num­ber of Covid-19 cases surged in Florida.</p>
    <p>Repub­li­cans will still have their party busi­ness meet­ings in Char­lotte, but this will in­volve rel­a­tively few peo­ple, and most of the RNC’s pro­gramme will be de­liv­ered from else­where.</p>
    <p>The big ques­tion this year is whether go­ing vir­tual will af­fect voter sup­port, with ob­servers ques­tion­ing whether the on­line con­ven­tions can gen­er­ate the same kind of en­thu­si­asm as in-per­son ral­lies.</p>
    <p>“Cer­tainly, the par­ties hope that they can repli­cate the same in­ten­sity of mes­sage that they’ve tra­di­tion­ally done through the rally­based tele­vi­sion-cen­tric con­ven­tions, but we just don’t know yet,” said Prof Heberlig.</p>
    <p>He reck­oned the mes­sag­ing power of the con­ven­tions will be weaker than usual, but said vot­ers al­ready have very strong and po­larised opin­ions about Mr Trump any­way. The con­ven­tions are there­fore un­likely to change many minds, he said. “I don’t ex­pect much bump for ei­ther party after the con­ven­tions, and what­ever bump they get I doubt is go­ing to be sus­tained for very long.”</p>
    <p>REACH­ING OUT THROUGH ON­LINE RAL­LIES</p>
    <p>Cer­tainly, the par­ties hope that they can repli­cate the same in­ten­sity of mes­sage that they’ve tra­di­tion­ally done through the rally-based tele­vi­sion-cen­tric con­ven­tions, but we just don’t know yet... I don’t ex­pect much bump for ei­ther party after the con­ven­tions, and what­ever bump they get I doubt is go­ing to be sus­tained for very long. ’’</p>
    <p>PRO­FES­SOR ERIC HEBERLIG, po­lit­i­cal sci­en­tist at the Uni­ver­sity of North Carolina at Char­lotte, on the party con­ven­tions go­ing vir­tual.</p>
