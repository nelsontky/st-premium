    <p>HONG KONG • What started out as scrib­bles on nap­kins have turned into a handy guide on how to run a restau­rant in a pan­demic, now re­ferred to by busi­nesses in var­i­ous sec­tors around the world.</p>
    <p>The 20-page Covid-19 Play­book, a mish­mash of com­mon sense and prac­ti­cal­ity cov­er­ing top­ics like san­i­ta­tion prac­tices, health pro­to­cols and guest re­la­tions, was com­piled by the man­age­ment team at Hong Kong hos­pi­tal­ity group Black Sheep Restau­rants.</p>
    <p>“Back in Jan­uary, when we heard mur­murs of some­thing hap­pen­ing in Wuhan, we felt that this was go­ing to come to our doorstep,” said the group’s co-founder Syed Asim Hussain.</p>
    <p>The team pieced to­gether an in­ter­nal set of pro­to­cols to be rolled out across the group’s 27 restau­rants – one in Shang­hai and the rest in Hong Kong.</p>
    <p>In April, the hand­book was shared on­line and went vi­ral. It was down­loaded over 5,000 times.</p>
    <p>It is now avail­able in English, Chi­nese, Ja­panese, French and Span­ish. It is read not just by in­dus­try peo­ple in Hong Kong but also peo­ple around the world in gov­ern­ments, academia, as well as the travel and fash­ion in­dus­tries.</p>
    <p>“We don’t claim to be Covid-19 ex­perts but we’re just say­ing it is stuff that we are do­ing to pro­tect our peo­ple, look af­ter our guests, and oth­ers may find it use­ful too,” said Mr Hussain.</p>
    <p>Given the sever­ity of the pan­demic, restau­rants in Hong Kong have been shut­ter­ing de­spite sub­si­dies from the govern­ment.</p>
    <p>“We are what makes Hong Kong glossy and if we lose that, of course it’s our loss, it’s the in­dus­try’s loss, but it’s also the city’s loss.”</p>
    <p>For the first time since the com­pany started in 2012, Black Sheep clocked fi­nan­cial losses for two suc­ces­sive quar­ters this year.</p>
    <p>But its fi­nan­cial suc­cess in the first seven years has al­lowed it to trudge on while keep­ing ev­ery­one on the team, which Mr Hussain said is “my big­gest suc­cess as a per­son”.</p>
    <p>And as he tries to get through week by week, the 35-year-old, who is Hong Kong-born with Pak­istani roots, is op­ti­mistic about the op­por­tu­ni­ties in the com­ing year.</p>
    <p>“For ex­am­ple, some amaz­ing real es­tate op­por­tu­ni­ties.</p>
    <p>“Lux­ury brands are look­ing at de­creas­ing their foot­print in cities like Hong Kong and Sin­ga­pore, so I think that foot­print will be re­placed by hos­pi­tal­ity brands.”</p>
    <p>We are what makes Hong Kong glossy and if we lose that, of course it’s our loss, it’s the in­dus­try’s loss, but it’s also the city’s loss.</p>
