    <p>BANGKOK • Thai­land is re­plac­ing the top two of­fi­cials steer­ing the econ­omy through its worst cri­sis, in­ject­ing more un­cer­tainty into the pol­icy out­look.</p>
    <p>Fi­nance Min­is­ter Ut­tama Sa­vanayana re­signed last Thurs­day ahead of a Cab­i­net reshuf­fle, with Prime Min­is­ter Prayut Chan-o-cha say­ing he will an­nounce a likely re­place­ment by next month.</p>
    <p>At the Bank of Thai­land, the search for a suc­ces­sor to gov­er­nor Veerathai Santiprabh­ob is en­ter­ing the fi­nal stages, al­though the Cab­i­net changes may de­lay that process. Mr Veerathai, 50, has de­clined to seek a new term when his cur­rent one ends in Septem­ber.</p>
    <p>The up­heaval comes at a time of height­ened un­cer­tainty in the global econ­omy and a slump in ex­port- and tourism-re­liant Thai­land that is among the worst in Asia.</p>
    <p>The fi­nance min­is­ter and cen­tral bank gov­er­nor helped shape a 1.9 tril­lion baht (S$83 bil­lion) stim­u­lus pack­age that is meant to curb the eco­nomic fall­out from the pan­demic, and in­vestors want to see those funds put to work.</p>
    <p>“We are in a cru­cial time of tran­si­tion from lock­down to re­sump­tion of busi­ness, so the con­tin­u­a­tion of key poli­cies is very im­por­tant to help the econ­omy hit by the out­break,” said Mr Vasin Vanichvo­ra­nun, chair­man of Kasikorn As­set Man­age­ment. The sooner the re­place­ments are found, the bet­ter, he added.</p>
    <p>Mr Somkid Ja­tus­rip­i­tak, who was deputy prime min­is­ter in charge of the econ­omy, also re­signed along­side Mr Ut­tama last week, an­other blow to the gov­ern­ment’s man­age­ment team.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, Labour Min­is­ter Cha­tu­mon­gol Son­akul said he had re­signed from his post, mak­ing him the sixth min­is­ter to quit the gov­ern­ment since late last week. He did not give a rea­son or com­ment fur­ther. He had last month stepped down as leader of the Ac­tion Coali­tion for Thai­land, one of 20 part­ners in Mr Prayut’s gov­ern­ment.</p>
    <p>Ear­lier yes­ter­day, Min­is­ter to the Prime Min­is­ter’s Of­fice Te­wan Lip­ta­pan­lop re­signed from the Cab­i­net. Other than Mr Ut­tama and Mr Somkid, two other min­is­ters also quit on Thurs­day.</p>
    <p>Mr Prayut is set to make his first Cab­i­net changes since his vic­tory in last year’s dis­puted elec­tion.</p>
    <p>A for­mer army chief, he led a mil­i­tary coup in 2014 and ruled as the head of a junta for five years be­fore re­turn­ing at the head of a mul­ti­party coali­tion af­ter the vote.</p>
    <p>Mr Ut­tama was re­cently re­placed as leader of the largest po­lit­i­cal party in the coali­tion.</p>
    <p>Youth-led protests have re­sumed against Mr Prayut. Thou­sands of pro­test­ers gath­ered in Bangkok and a few other cities over the week­end to de­mand the gov­ern­ment’s res­ig­na­tion, drawing the big­gest crowds since the lock­down be­gan in March.</p>
    <p>The po­lit­i­cal shake-up could not have come at a worse time for the econ­omy. The cen­tral bank ex­pects gross do­mes­tic prod­uct to shrink 8.1 per cent this year. It is also deal­ing with cur­rency tur­moil that is un­der­min­ing ex­ports, and is ex­am­in­ing new ways of sup­port­ing the econ­omy as it runs out of con­ven­tional pol­icy space.</p>
    <p>Mr Veerathai said at a sem­i­nar yes­ter­day that it will take about two years for the econ­omy to re­turn to its pre-Covid lev­els, based on the as­sump­tion that the out­break can be kept un­der con­trol.</p>
    <p>Rather than a V-shaped re­cov­ery, he sees the tra­jec­tory more like a “check mark with a long tail”.</p>
    <p>“I am con­cerned the most about em­ploy­ment as tourism and re­lated busi­nesses em­ploy lots of peo­ple,” the gov­er­nor said. “When the out­break hit, so many peo­ple lost their jobs” and many prob­a­bly will not get them back, he added.</p>
    <p>The fi­nance min­is­ter post is a key one mar­ket par­tic­i­pants are watch­ing. Mr Prayut said last week he is wait­ing to hear from po­ten­tial suc­ces­sors he has ap­proached – some of whom are “out­siders” with­out po­lit­i­cal back­grounds.</p>
    <p>One of the can­di­dates he ap­proached is a well-known banker, who has emerged as the pos­si­ble front run­ner for the post.</p>
    <p>The new fi­nance min­is­ter will pick the next cen­tral bank gov­er­nor from a short­list of can­di­dates. A se­lec­tion com­mit­tee re­ceived six ap­pli­ca­tions for the po­si­tion, in­clud­ing from two cur­rent deputy gov­er­nors. The likely front run­ner, ac­cord­ing to me­dia re­ports, is a cur­rent mem­ber of the bank’s Mon­e­tary Pol­icy Com­mit­tee.</p>
    <p>In­vestors are heart­ened by the fact that the likely re­place­ments are well known and qual­i­fied, but ex­pect the road ahead to be a dif­fi­cult one. “What the new­com­ers need to deal with are real tough jobs,” said Mr Win Phromphaet, chief in­vest­ment of­fi­cer of Prin­ci­pal As­set Man­age­ment in Bangkok.</p>
    <p>“The cen­tral bank has lim­ited pol­icy space and they will need to han­dle ris­ing bad debts go­ing for­ward, while the task of the fi­nance min­is­ter, who will need to boost the econ­omy af­ter Covid-19, is also very dif­fi­cult.”</p>
