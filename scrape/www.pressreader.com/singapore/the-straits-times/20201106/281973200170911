    <p>Se­nior Min­is­ter of State for Health Koh Poh Koon at­trib­uted Sin­ga­pore’s ris­ing health­care costs to the age­ing pop­u­la­tion, along with med­i­cal ad­vance­ments and in­creased op­er­at­ing costs (Koh Poh Koon de­tails key driv­ers of ris­ing health­care costs here, Nov 3).</p>
    <p>How­ever, it is ten­u­ous to cite age­ing as a key driver of ris­ing health­care costs be­cause age­ing and the use of health­care re­sources are me­di­ated by many life­style and chronic dis­eases.</p>
    <p>Some of these dis­eases may be­gin be­fore age­ing sets in. Obe­sity and di­a­betes are two salient ones.</p>
    <p>Age­ing peo­ple who are obese or have di­a­betes con­sume much more health­care re­sources as a re­sult of these con­di­tions, com­pared with their coun­ter­parts with­out these prob­lems.</p>
    <p>For ex­am­ple, of the 1,500 di­a­betic lower-limb am­putees an­nu­ally, the av­er­age age for those who un­dergo ma­jor am­pu­ta­tions is 66. The am­pu­ta­tion and its as­so­ci­ated high cost are driven by di­a­betes, not age.</p>
    <p>The MediShield Life Coun­cil has re­cently pro­posed to raise MediShield Life pre­mi­ums by up to 35 per cent.</p>
    <p>Ex­plain­ing the hike with age­ing alone masks the fact that Sin­ga­pore is among the coun­tries with the high­est pro­por­tions of di­a­bet­ics.</p>
    <p>Fur­ther­more, from 1992 to 2017, the num­ber of over­weight and obese Sin­ga­pore­ans in­creased from 26.2 per cent to 36.2 per cent.</p>
    <p>The World Health Or­gan­i­sa­tion de­clares that over­weight or obese in­di­vid­u­als are at ma­jor risk of car­dio­vas­cu­lar dis­eases, di­a­betes, mus­cu­loskele­tal con­di­tions and some can­cers (in­clud­ing breast, ovar­ian, prostate, liver and colon).</p>
    <p>Obe­sity is not an in­evitable part of age­ing. We com­pare un­favourably with Ja­pan, which has the low­est pro­por­tion of over­weight and obese peo­ple among Or­gan­i­sa­tion for Eco­nomic Co­op­er­a­tion and De­vel­op­ment coun­tries, at 23.8 per cent.</p>
    <p>One won­ders, had we been more pre-emp­tive, in­ter­ven­tional and ef­fec­tive with our pub­lic health mea­sures, would we be in a bet­ter po­si­tion now?</p>
    <p>When the run­way is too short, an ex­pe­di­ent thing to do is to raise the MediShield Life pre­mi­ums, which is es­sen­tially just a fi­nan­cial so­lu­tion for a med­i­cal prob­lem.</p>
    <p>Many ini­tia­tives within the “war on di­a­betes” cam­paign are ed­u­ca­tional and vol­un­tary. The ef­fec­tive­ness re­mains to be seen.</p>
    <p>As for obe­sity, we ap­pear to be very ten­ta­tive, as if avoid­ing be­ing la­belled “fat sham­ing” is more im­por­tant than slow­ing the tra­jec­tory of a ma­jor health cri­sis.</p>
    <p>Pub­lic health pro­grammes re­quire hard work, are re­source-in­ten­sive and need a long lead time to see re­sults.</p>
    <p>We need to act ag­gres­sively now to get to the root of the prob­lem.</p>
    <p>Age­ing peo­ple who are obese or have di­a­betes con­sume much more health­care re­sources as a re­sult of these con­di­tions, com­pared with their coun­ter­parts with­out these prob­lems.</p>
