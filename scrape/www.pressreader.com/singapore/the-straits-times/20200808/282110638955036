    <p>The Health Sciences Au­thor­ity (HSA) has warned peo­ple not to buy or con­sume three prod­ucts that are sold on­line, two of which had been banned be­fore but resur­faced re­cently in new pack­ag­ing.</p>
    <p>The danger­ous prod­ucts are pow­dered drinks Coco Curv and Choco Fit, as well as candy Hamer Candy, it said on Thursday.</p>
    <p>Both Coco Curv and Choco Fit con­tain sibu­tramine, a pre­scrip­tion drug to aid weight loss that was banned in Sin­ga­pore in 2010 for in­creas­ing heart at­tack and stroke risks.</p>
    <p>Hamer Candy con­tains nor­tadalafil, a sub­stance chem­i­cally re­lated to tadalafil, which is a pre­scrip­tion erec­tile dys­func­tion drug. In­ap­pro­pri­ate use of tadalafil will raise a per­son’s risk of hav­ing a stroke, heart at­tack, low blood pres­sure and painful and ex­ceed­ingly long erec­tions.</p>
    <p>The three prod­ucts were sold on lo­cal e-com­merce plat­forms such as Shopee and Qoo10, as well as so­cial me­dia plat­forms such as Facebook and In­sta­gram.</p>
    <p>HSA said it has is­sued warn­ings to the sell­ers and sup­pli­ers to stop sell­ing them.</p>
    <p>It has also di­rected the re­spec­tive web­site ad­min­is­tra­tors to take down the af­fected listings.</p>
    <p>Its anal­y­sis of the prod­ucts found that con­trary to the list­ing of in­gre­di­ents on the pack­ag­ing, the prod­ucts had po­tent in­gre­di­ents that may pose se­ri­ous health risks to peo­ple.</p>
    <p>HSA said it had warned peo­ple about Hamer Candy in Novem­ber 2018 and Choco Fit in June last year, and the pre­vi­ous post­ings of these prod­ucts had been re­moved.</p>
    <p>But both made a come­back re­cently in new pack­ag­ing, a com­mon tac­tic used by un­scrupu­lous man­u­fac­tur­ers to evade de­tec­tion and en­tice con­sumers, said the HSA.</p>
    <p>A Qoo10 spokesman said on Thursday that it re­moved a Coco Curv list­ing on its site within three hours of be­ing in­formed by HSA on April 6. No sales were made prior to its re­moval, he added.</p>
    <p>HSA said it is il­le­gal to sell and sup­ply adul­ter­ated prod­ucts con­tain­ing banned sub­stances or po­tent chem­i­cal in­gre­di­ents. Those con­victed face a max­i­mum fine of $10,000, up to two years in jail, or both.</p>
    <p>Peo­ple with in­for­ma­tion on the sale and sup­ply of these il­le­gal prod­ucts may con­tact HSA on 6866-3485 dur­ing of­fice hours on week­days, or send an e-mail to hsa_is@hsa.gov.sg</p>
