    <p>The vin­tage ar­chi­tec­ture and pitched roof of this com­pact cor­ner ter­raced house built in the 1950s sealed the deal for de­signer Kelvin Teo.</p>
    <p>Drawn by the charm of its ar­chi­tec­ture, he re­tained its struc­ture.</p>
    <p>“I’d been on the l ook­out for prop­erty in Dis­trict 13 for a while,” says Mr Teo, 45, founder of Space Sense Stu­dio. “The house was also in its orig­i­nal state, which was one of my cri­te­ria.”</p>
    <p>This gave him the free­dom to trans­form the house – lo­cated in the Sen­nett es­tate with a built-up floor area of 1,900 sq ft – to his taste. The ren­o­va­tion, which took a year and eight months, cost $450,000. Mr Teo, his wife and their two chil­dren moved in late last year.</p>
    <p>He dressed the fa­cade with grey bricks and steel cladding, in­stantly giv­ing it a con­tem­po­rary up­date.</p>
    <p>Past the main en­trance, he over­hauled the en­tire lay­out of the ground floor, cre­at­ing an open­con­cept com­mu­nal space with a “fire­place” cabi­net be­side the sofa, and used acous­tic wall pan­elling with a fish-scale pat­tern for the fea­ture wall.</p>
    <p>Its in­stal­la­tion was not with­out trial and er­ror. The same went for con­ceal­ing the bath­room door, fridge, pantry and store­room door, which he tack­led with L-shaped wood pan­elling.</p>
    <p>The fur­ni­ture and in­te­rior de­signer says: “My de­sign nar­ra­tive was to cre­ate a dif­fer­ent con­cept for each level that was based on a monochro­matic pal­ette. Each space forms its own per­son­al­ity and iden­tity and its theme was en­hanced through the use of nat­u­ral ma­te­ri­als with strong, vis­i­ble tex­tures.”</p>
    <p>The dark floor­ing gives the ground level a bold, mas­cu­line vibe.</p>
    <p>A va­ri­ety of tex­tures – such as the burnt wood-tex­tured floor­ing, oak ve­neer wood strips, mar­ble sur­faces and acous­tic wall pan­elling – en­rich the set­ting.</p>
    <p>Mr Teo’s Pa­per Fold chair, which won De­sign of the Year at the Pres­i­dent’s De­sign Award in 2009, adds a splash of colour.</p>
    <p>Far­ther in, the kitchen has a float­ing is­land counter that is con­nected to a pull-out din­ing ta­ble.</p>
    <p>In ad­di­tion to full-height win­dows, a glass roof lets in more nat­u­ral light. Mr Teo says: “I like the feel­ing of stand­ing in the rain with­out get­ting wet. That’s the idea of hav­ing the glass roof. I get to ex­pe­ri­ence the rain­drops.”</p>
    <p>The sec­ond level, with epoxy floor­ing and brick walls doused in white, is a dou­ble-vol­ume space.</p>
    <p>Up above, the pitched ceil­ing sits over solid wood planks sal­vaged from other pro­jects.</p>
    <p>He says: “I’ve al­ways liked in­te­ri­ors with at­tic roofs. It gives the emo­tional, laid-back and cosy feel of a cot­tage, a farm­house or a sum­mer house.”</p>
    <p>The sleep­ing space is in the loft and reach­able by a nar­row flight of steps. In­spired by the Dan­ish con­cept of hygge, its wood-tex­tured vinyl floor­ing com­ple­ments the wood-clad ceil­ing.</p>
    <p>With this home, Mr Teo says he en­joyed the chal­lenges of birthing new ideas and im­ple­ment­ing his ex­per­i­ments.</p>
    <p>“As a de­signer, the na­ture of my role is to experiment with new things and to challenge my­self. It’s al­ways ex­cit­ing to cre­ate unique de­signs – even when I know I will be get­ting my hands dirty.”</p>
