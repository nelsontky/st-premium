    <p>Q How would you know if work­ers who visit your home or work­place are free of Covid-19?</p>
    <p>A As Sin­ga­pore con­tin­ues to re­open, many peo­ple may wish to com­plete long-awaited re­pairs or ser­vice ameni­ties at home or in the of­fice.</p>
    <p>Un­der­stand­ably, some may fear invit­ing strangers into their homes dur­ing a pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Short of a swab or blood test, it is im­pos­si­ble to tell for sure if any­one – worker or not – is free of Covid-19, es­pe­cially given the asymp­to­matic na­ture of the virus.</p>
    <p>But sev­eral pre­cau­tions have been taken by the au­thor­i­ties to re­duce the virus’ spread in the com­mu­nity, and there are steps you can take to give your­self ad­di­tional re­as­sur­ance.</p>
    <p>PRE­CAU­TIONS FOR A SAFE RESTART</p>
    <p>The au­thor­i­ties have man­dated nu­mer­ous rules to en­sure a safe re­open­ing of the econ­omy. These in­clude safe man­age­ment mea­sures for busi­nesses as well as work­ers.</p>
    <p>For ex­am­ple, at the work­place, seat­ing ar­range­ments need to be safely dis­tanced, and work­ers’ tem­per­a­tures have to be taken daily.</p>
    <p>To re­duce in­ter­ac­tions be­tween work­ers, work­ing from home has be­come the de­fault ar­range­ment, and so­cial­i­sa­tion be­tween work­ers is for­bid­den. Masks have to be worn at all times while at work.</p>
    <p>More specif­i­cally, there are ad­di­tional rules for for­eign work­ers in low- or mid-skilled work that re­quire them to en­ter work­places or of­fices, such as re­pairs or mi­nor con­struc­tion and elec­tric work.</p>
    <p>All work per­mit and S Pass hold­ers must down­load FWMOMCare, the Min­istry of Man­power’s mo­bile app, and use it to re­port twice a day to the au­thor­i­ties, pro­vid­ing de­tails of their health and tem­per­a­ture.</p>
    <p>For­eign work­ers serv­ing their stay-home no­tice out­side ded­i­cated fa­cil­i­ties from Aug 11 are also tagged with a wear­able elec­tronic de­vice that will alert the au­thor­i­ties if they leave their res­i­dence.</p>
    <p>Work­ers stay­ing in dor­mi­to­ries who can leave for work would have a “green” Ac­cessCode which they can show on their phones.</p>
    <p>This in­di­cates that they have ful­filled sev­eral re­quire­ments, in­clud­ing that they have tested neg­a­tive for Covid-19, and their em­ployer has been ap­proved by the au­thor­i­ties and has im­ple­mented mea­sures like stag­gered trans­port ar­range­ments.</p>
    <p>Em­ploy­ers in the con­struc­tion sec­tor would have to make sure co­hort­ing ar­range­ments are in place to pre­vent mix­ing of work­ers from dif­fer­ent work sites.</p>
    <p>Work­ers would also have to down­load TraceTo­gether and use SafeEn­try when they en­ter work­places.</p>
    <p>On top of this, the au­thor­i­ties have re­quired rou­tine test­ing of all such work­ers ev­ery 14 days to quickly pick up and iso­late any cases of Covid-19.</p>
    <p>PRE­CAU­TIONS YOU CAN TAKE</p>
    <p>That said, work­ers – for­eign or lo­cal – liv­ing in non-dor­mi­tory res­i­dences are not in­her­ently at higher risk of trans­mit­ting the virus.</p>
    <p>As with other vis­i­tors to your home, there are sev­eral things you can do if you feel the need to take ex­tra pre­cau­tions against ex­po­sure.</p>
    <p>The Health Min­istry has said that house­hold vis­i­tors are strongly en­cour­aged to ob­serve safe man­age­ment prin­ci­ples, in­clud­ing wear­ing a mask, keep­ing a safe dis­tance of at least 1m, min­imis­ing phys­i­cal con­tact and wash­ing hands reg­u­larly.</p>
    <p>You and your fam­ily should wear masks, and make sure the worker also dons one while he is in your home. One is al­ready re­quired to wear a mask at work.</p>
    <p>You may also wish to in­vest in a con­tact­less method of tem­per­a­ture check­ing, such as an in­frared ther­mome­ter, for any visi­tor to your home.</p>
    <p>You can also pro­vide hand sani­tiser at the en­trance to your home. Many of­fices al­ready have sim­i­lar ther­mome­ters or use ther­mal scan­ners, and also have hand sani­tiser dis­pensers.</p>
    <p>While the worker is car­ry­ing out his work, you can main­tain a safe dis­tance or go to a sep­a­rate room in your home or of­fice.</p>
    <p>Opt for a con­tact­less means of pay­ing the worker if pos­si­ble, for ex­am­ple, by us­ing dig­i­tal pay­ment mo­bile apps, and avoid shak­ing the worker’s hand when show­ing your ap­pre­ci­a­tion for the work.</p>
    <p>Af­ter he leaves, you may wish to dis­in­fect the sur­faces he touched, in­clud­ing door­knobs and light switches.</p>
    <p>To re­duce in­ter­ac­tions be­tween work­ers, work­ing from home has be­come the de­fault ar­range­ment, and so­cial­i­sa­tion be­tween work­ers is for­bid­den. Masks have to be worn at all times while at work.</p>
