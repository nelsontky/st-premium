    <p>Man­ager Frank Lam­pard (right) said he needed more time to work with the new play­ers after Chelsea’s de­fen­sive frail­ties came un­der fire de­spite be­ing the big­gest spenders in the trans­fer win­dow. But time will not be on his side as they host Sevilla in their open­ing Cham­pi­ons League Group E clash to­day.</p>
    <p>LON­DON • Chelsea man­ager Frank Lam­pard be­lieves reign­ing Euro­pean cham­pi­ons Bay­ern Mu­nich are a bench­mark for his young play­ers as they tar­get im­prove­ments on all fronts ahead of their Cham­pi­ons League opener against Sevilla.</p>
    <p>Bay­ern thrashed the Blues 7-1 on ag­gre­gate in the last 16 last sea­son be­fore lift­ing the tro­phy for the sixth time in Au­gust.</p>
    <p>The Blues are ob­vi­ously not at that level yet, and are still work­ing out the kinks fol­low­ing their £220 mil­lion (S$388 mil­lion) splurge i n the trans­fer mar­ket, which has yet to pay div­i­dends.</p>
    <p>How­ever, Lam­pard has urged his team to use Bay­ern as the yard­stick, in­sist­ing there is plenty of un­tapped po­ten­tial in his side de­spite their topsy-turvy form in the Premier League.</p>
    <p>“It is a great plat­form to learn be­cause you’re play­ing against the best, and we played against the best in Bay­ern Mu­nich,” Lam­pard said at his pre-match vir­tual press con­fer­ence ahead of to­day’s Group E tie at Stam­ford Bridge.</p>
    <p>“We were a young team last year, work­ing a lot to im­prove, and the Bay­ern game was a great marker for the young play­ers in the squad to re­alise the lev­els that need to be at­tained. I re­mem­ber hav­ing that my­self as a young player.</p>
    <p>“Of the play­ers we have brought in, some have more Cham­pi­ons League ex­pe­ri­ence than oth­ers.”</p>
    <p>Chelsea have added Cham­pi­ons League ex­pe­ri­ence to the squad in the close sea­son with the ar­rival of de­fender Thi­ago Silva and for­wards Kai Havertz, Timo Werner and Hakim Ziyech.</p>
    <p>Three of them have reached at least the last-four stage in the past two sea­sons and most pun­dits ex­pect Chelsea and Sevilla to be fight­ing it out for the top two spots, given that the other teams are debu­tants Krasnodar of Rus­sia and France’s Rennes.</p>
    <p>How­ever, Lam­pard is re­fus­ing to take their ex­pected progress to the knock­out stage for granted, espe­cially as glar­ing er­rors have pock­marked their start to the sea­son.</p>
    <p>“I men­tioned be­fore about con­cen­tra­tion, fo­cus and dis­ci­pline and that be­comes even more im­por­tant here than other com­pe­ti­tions be­cause of the level of Cham­pi­ons League,” he added. “That’s what I would al­ways make very clear to the play­ers go­ing into a match against some­one of the qual­ity of Sevilla.”</p>
    <p>Like­wise, Blues cap­tain Ce­sar Azpilicuet­a also urged his at­tack­ing team­mates to pitch in as de­fend­ing is a “col­lec­tive” ef­fort.</p>
    <p>Claim­ing it would not be pos­si­ble to outscore their op­po­nents in ev­ery game, the Spain right-back said: “When you are weak de­fen­sively, some­times we feel like we have to score three or four goals ev­ery game, which some­times you can­not do, it’s a re­al­ity.</p>
    <p>“When we don’t score, as a de­fender, I think how can we put our at­tack­ing play­ers in a bet­ter sit­u­a­tion. Col­lec­tively, we have to im­prove so we all de­fend to­gether, it doesn’t mat­ter our po­si­tion... at the mo­ment, we have to im­prove that.”</p>
    <p>How­ever, with first-choice goal­keeper Edouard Mendy out in­jured, Lam­pard must choose between er­ror-prone Kepa Ar­riz­a­bal­aga or 39-year-old backup Willy Ca­ballero for the Europa League win­ners’ visit, with nei­ther player in­spir­ing any sort of con­fi­dence as the last line of de­fence.</p>
