    <p>In­done­sia’s state-owned phar­ma­ceu­ti­cal com­pany Bio Farma, which has been work­ing with Chi­nese firm Si­no­vac on a Covid-19 vac­cine since April, is set to be­gin the third and fi­nal phase of clin­i­cal tri­als on hu­mans next month.</p>
    <p>If the trial is successful, pro­duc­tion will be­gin in the first quar­ter of next year with a max­i­mum 250 mil­lion doses a year.</p>
    <p>Si­no­vac has been look­ing for vol­un­teers out­side of China be­cause Covid-19 has been largely con­tained in the country.</p>
    <p>Test­ing a vac­cine’s ef­fi­cacy in a late-stage trial usu­ally re­quires thou­sands of people at a lo­ca­tion where a virus is still spread­ing. In­fec­tions, as well as fa­tal­i­ties, con­tinue to mount in In­done­sia.</p>
    <p>As many as 1,620 vol­un­teers have come for­ward to par­tic­i­pate in the trial that would jointly be con­ducted by Bio Farma and the Univer­sity of Pad­jad­jaran in West Java.</p>
    <p>Mr Budi Gu­nadi Sadikin, a high­rank­ing mem­ber of the newly formed na­tional eco­nomic re­cov­ery and Covid-19 re­sponse team, said yes­ter­day that Phase III clin­i­cal tri­als would be­gin next month with vac­cine can­di­dates from Si­no­vac.</p>
    <p>“We are work­ing on the vac­cines as well as the drugs to treat people if they are not sick. Both, to be hon­est, are in quite ad­vanced stages, in terms of de­vel­op­ment,” Mr Budi said in re­sponse to a ques­tion from The Straits Times dur­ing a panel dis­cus­sion or­gan­ised by the Jakarta For­eign Cor­re­spon­dents Club.</p>
    <p>He added that Si­no­vac is do­ing clin­i­cal tri­als not only in In­done­sia – the Chi­nese com­pany is also con­cur­rently do­ing so in Brazil, Tur­key, Bangladesh and Chile – but the tri­als in In­done­sia have reached the most ad­vanced stage.</p>
    <p>“It is im­por­tant for the vac­cine can­di­dates to be tested across the world so that you can learn the re­sponse from dif­fer­ent races with dif­fer­ent ge­netic make-up,” said Mr Budi.</p>
    <p>In In­done­sia, any vac­cine can­di­date would have to be li­censed by</p>
    <p>As many as 1,620 vol­un­teers have come for­ward to par­tic­i­pate in the trial that would jointly be con­ducted by Bio Farma and the Univer­sity of Pad­jad­jaran in West Java.</p>
    <p>the country’s Food and Drug Mon­i­tor­ing Agency, the equiv­a­lent of the United States Food and Drug Ad­min­is­tra­tion.</p>
    <p>Like other coun­tries af­fected by the Covid-19 pan­demic, In­done­sia is ex­pe­dit­ing ef­forts to come up with ef­fec­tive vac­cines within a pe­riod of months, a process that would nor­mally take years.</p>
    <p>Un­like most vac­cine ef­forts else­where, Si­no­vac’s is based on an in­ac­ti­vated whole virus, a ma­ture vac­cine tech­nol­ogy that has also been used to pro­duce vac­cines against in­fluenza and po­lio. In con­trast, many of the oth­ers are work­ing on nextgen­er­a­tion plat­forms that in­volve us­ing the DNA or RNA of the coro­n­avirus that causes Covid-19.</p>
    <p>Bio Farma’s pres­i­dent di­rec­tor</p>
    <p>Hon­esti Basyir said in a state­ment that the ship­ment of the vac­cine can­di­dates from Si­no­vac ar­rived in In­done­sia on Sun­day and would first need to be tested at the com­pany’s lab­o­ra­tory.</p>
    <p>It would then have to get ap­proval from the govern­ment be­fore fi­nal clin­i­cal tri­als could be­gin.</p>
    <p>“If the Phase III clin­i­cal trial runs smoothly, Bio Farma will start pro­duc­tion in the first quar­ter 2021. We have lined up the re­quired equip­ment,” said Mr Hon­esti.</p>
    <p>Bio Farma’s head of re­search and de­vel­op­ment, Dr Neni Nu­rainy, told The Straits Times the com­pany had the ca­pac­ity to pro­duce up to 250 mil­lion doses a year.</p>
