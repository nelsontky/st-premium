    <p>MANILA • China’s embassy in the Philip­pines has de­nounced the United States for “cre­at­ing chaos” in Asia, af­ter a vis­it­ing White House en­voy backed coun­tries i n dis­putes with China and ac­cused Bei­jing of us­ing mil­i­tary pres­sure to fur­ther its in­ter­ests.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing a trip to Manila on Mon­day, na­tional se­cu­rity ad­viser Robert O’Brien un­der­scored the Amer­i­can com­mit­ment to Tai­wan and told the Philip­pines and Viet­nam, coun­tries both locked in mar­itime rows with China, that “we’ve got your back”.</p>
    <p>“It shows that his visit to this re­gion is not to pro­mote re­gional peace and sta­bil­ity, but to cre­ate chaos in the re­gion in or­der to seek self­ish in­ter­ests of the US,” the Chi­nese embassy said in a state­ment is­sued late on Mon­day.</p>
    <p>The US should “stop in­cit­ing con­fronta­tion” i n the South China Sea and “stop mak­ing ir­re­spon­si­ble re­marks on the Tai­wan and Hong Kong is­sue, which are purely China’s in­ter­nal af­fairs”, the state­ment said.</p>
    <p>Mr O’Brien has warned Bei­jing that it would face a “back­lash” if it at­tempted to use mil­i­tary force to co­erce Tai­wan, which China views as one of its prov­inces with no right to stateto-state ties.</p>
    <p>The US and China have been at log­ger­heads over is­sues rang­ing from tech­nol­ogy and hu­man rights to Chi­nese mar­itime mil­i­tari­sa­tion, with each ac­cus­ing the other of de­lib­er­ately provoca­tive be­hav­iour.</p>
    <p>China has staked claim to 90 per cent of the South China Sea, in­clud­ing ar­eas claimed by Brunei, Malaysia, the Philip­pines, Tai­wan and Viet­nam.</p>
    <p>An in­ter­na­tional tri­bunal in 2016 ruled that China’s ex­pan­sive claim, based on its his­tor­i­cal maps, is in­con­sis­tent with in­ter­na­tional law.</p>
    <p>Wash­ing­ton has re­peat­edly sent war­ships to the strate­gic wa­ter­way to demon­strate free­dom of nav­i­ga­tion there.</p>
    <p>“Facts have proved that the US is the big­gest driver of the mil­i­tari­sa­tion,” the embassy state­ment said, call­ing it “the most dan­ger­ous ex­ter­nal fac­tor” in the South China Sea.</p>
    <p>The US embassy in Manila had no im­me­di­ate re­sponse.</p>
