    <p>SEOUL • A South Korean ac­tor who starred in a mu­si­cal has lost his fan club af­ter photos of him club­bing emerged.</p>
    <p>Kim Jun-young (right), 30, came un­der fire for par­ty­ing at a Seoul club from last Thurs­day night to last Fri­day morn­ing af­ter photos of him at the club went vi­ral on so­cial me­dia.</p>
    <p>He is a lead­ing ac­tor in the mu­si­cal Lud­wig: Beethoven The Piano.</p>
    <p>As his club­bing photos trig­gered a storm on­line, Kim has stepped down from the show since last Satur­day.</p>
    <p>The pro­duc­tion com­pany of Lud­wig said Kim did not have any con­tact with other mem­bers of the pro­duc­tion team af­ter vis­it­ing the club.</p>
    <p>“I for­got my role as a stage ac­tor who meets the au­di­ence di­rectly, mak­ing a wrong de­ci­sion which trou­bles oth­ers,” Kim said on his so­cial me­dia ac­count last Satur­day, ex­press­ing re­gret for his ac­tion.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to his agency HJ Cul­ture, Kim vol­un­tar­ily tested for Covid-19 and re­sults came out neg­a­tive. He went into a two-week self­quar­an­tine and will be tested again at the end of the quar­an­tine pe­riod.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, his on­line fan club All Live Young has halted all ac­tiv­i­ties, say­ing: “We do not want to de­fend Kim’s care­less be­hav­iour.”</p>
    <p>The fan club added that the ac­tor has agreed to its shut­down.</p>
    <p>Kim made his stage de­but in 2018. Lud­wig was his first lead­ing role. His co-stars Jo Hwan-ji and Park Jun-hee will take over his role in the mu­si­cal.</p>
    <p>The show runs un­til next month .</p>
