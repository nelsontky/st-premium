    <p>THE LOW­DOWN</p>
    <p>The Cat Cafe, where chil­dren and adults can play with fe­lines while hav­ing a drink or a snack, has opened its se­cond branch at The Rail Mall. The orig­i­nal cafe opened in Bugis in 2014.</p>
    <p>FUN FAC­TOR</p>
    <p>When my seven-year-old and I ar­rive at about 10.30am, we take up a spot near the back of the cafe. To my daugh­ter’s de­light, the 11 cats started crowd­ing around her.</p>
    <p>We are told that the staff usu­ally emerge through a door at the back with their meals, hence the spike in activity around that area.</p>
    <p>The cats, aged one to six years old, are gen­tle and seem used to hav­ing strangers stroke them. One even jumps up to oc­cupy an empty seat at our ta­ble.</p>
    <p>LEARN­ING VALUE</p>
    <p>There is plenty to learn about fe­line be­hav­iour through ob­ser­va­tion and chats with the friendly staff.</p>
    <p>The cats were all aban­doned and res­cued – so therein is a les­son on re­spon­si­ble pet own­er­ship.</p>
    <p>ROOM FOR IM­PROVE­MENT</p>
    <p>There is time to idle when the cats are sleep­ing. The cafe has books about cats, so my daugh­ter spent the down­time read­ing.</p>
    <p>INSIDER TIP</p>
    <p>Get there an hour be­fore feed­ing times at 11am and 6pm – the cats are most ac­tive then. Most of them slink off to take a nap af­ter eat­ing.</p>
    <p>WILL WE BE BACK?</p>
    <p>Most def­i­nitely. My daugh­ters and my wife are crazy about cats. For my recce trip, I take only the older daugh­ter be­cause the cafe has a min­i­mum age re­quire­ment of six.</p>
    <p>We dis­cover later that the cafe some­times or­gan­ises ses­sions for kids un­der six – th­ese are an­nounced on its so­cial me­dia pages. I am look­ing for­ward to re­turn­ing with my wife and tod­dler in tow.</p>
