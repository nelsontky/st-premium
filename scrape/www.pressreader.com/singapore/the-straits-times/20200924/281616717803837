    <p>KUALA LUMPUR • In an­other twist in Malaysian pol­i­tics, for­merly jailed op­po­si­tion leader An­war Ibrahim an­nounced yes­ter­day that he has se­cured a ma­jor­ity among law­mak­ers to en­able him to form a new government.</p>
    <p>His move fol­lows months of po­lit­i­cal up­heaval that be­gan in Fe­bru­ary and comes af­ter a failed push for a con­fi­dence vote in Par­lia­ment against Prime Min­is­ter Muhyid­din Yassin.</p>
    <p>FEB 23</p>
    <p>Politi­cians f rom the Pakatan Hara­pan (PH) rul­ing coali­tion ex­plore a pos­si­ble al­liance with some mem­bers of the ousted former rul­ing party Umno and other groups, ac­cord­ing to sources.</p>
    <p>Datuk Seri An­war says some coali­tion col­leagues are try­ing to bring down the government and form a new one to deny him the premier­ship. Then Prime Min­is­ter Ma­hathir Mo­hamad was an­gry that he was pres­sured by proAn­war min­is­ters days ear­lier to set a clear han­dover time­line, sources have said.</p>
    <p>FEB 24</p>
    <p>Tun Dr Ma­hathir re­signs. The PH coali­tion col­lapses af­ter Dr Ma­hathir’s party withdraws. The King reap­points him as in­terim leader un­til a suc­ces­sor is named.</p>
    <p>FEB 25</p>
    <p>The palace says the King, Sul­tan Ab­dul­lah Ri’ay­atud­din, will meet all 222 fed­eral law­mak­ers be­fore de­cid­ing on the next step.</p>
    <p>FEB 26</p>
    <p>Dr Ma­hathir apol­o­gises for the po­lit­i­cal tur­moil, says he will re­turn as pre­mier if backed by Par­lia­ment to form a unity government not aligned with any po­lit­i­cal party. Mr An­war op­poses what he calls a “back­door government”. Three par­ties from PH nom­i­nate him as their prime min­is­te­rial can­di­date.</p>
    <p>FEB 28</p>
    <p>Af­ter meet­ing all law­mak­ers, the palace says the monarch is not con­fi­dent that any par­lia­men­tar­ian has ma­jor­ity sup­port to form a new government.</p>
    <p>Dr Ma­hathir’s Parti Pribumi Ber­satu Malaysia nom­i­nates Tan Sri Muhyid­din as a prime min­is­te­rial can­di­date. Umno and Parti Is­lam SeMalaysia vow to back him.</p>
    <p>FEB 29</p>
    <p>Dr Ma­hathir says he will stand for the premier­ship on be­half of the former rul­ing coali­tion PH.</p>
    <p>Dr Ma­hathir and Mr An­war are al­lies again.</p>
    <p>The King names Mr Muhyid­din as the next prime min­is­ter, as­sess­ing that he may have ma­jor­ity sup­port in Par­lia­ment.</p>
    <p>MARCH 1</p>
    <p>Dr Ma­hathir prom­ises to chal­lenge Mr Muhyid­din’s sup­port in the House and says the King will no longer see him.</p>
    <p>Mr Muhyid­din is sworn in as Malaysia’s eighth prime min­is­ter.</p>
    <p>MAY 8</p>
    <p>Par­lia­ment’s Speaker ac­cepts Dr Ma­hathir’s pro­posed May 18 vote of no con­fi­dence against Mr Muhyid­din.</p>
    <p>MAY 13</p>
    <p>The Speaker de­lays the con­fi­dence vote, af­ter the government pri­ori­tises fight­ing the coro­n­avirus out­break and sets just one or­der of par­lia­men­tary busi­ness for a sin­gle-day sit­ting.</p>
    <p>JULY 13</p>
    <p>Mr Muhyid­din wins nar­row back­ing from law­mak­ers – just two votes – for his bid to re­place the Speaker. The vote is widely seen as a gauge of Mr Muhyid­din’s leg­isla­tive sup­port and po­lit­i­cal strength.</p>
    <p>SEPT 23</p>
    <p>Mr An­war an­nounces he has se­cured a ma­jor­ity of the 222 law­mak­ers to form a new government, and is seek­ing an au­di­ence with the King for as­sent to take over from Mr Muhyid­din.</p>
    <p>Mem­bers of Mr Muhyid­din’s coali­tion say they back the Pre­mier.</p>
    <p>Mr Muhyid­din says he is the right­ful prime min­is­ter un­til proven oth­er­wise by con­sti­tu­tional pro­cesses.</p>
