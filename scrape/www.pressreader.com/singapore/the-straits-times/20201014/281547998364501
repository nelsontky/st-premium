    <p>In­dia will al­low cin­e­mas to open on Fri­day, even as its num­ber of Covid-19 cases is set to over­take that of the United States. Faced with a bat­tered econ­omy, the gov­ern­ment is con­tin­u­ing to loosen re­stric­tions.</p>
    <p>CLOS­ING PARKS, OPEN­ING HALLS</p>
    <p>Cities are clos­ing beaches and airy parks and keep­ing schools shut, but al­low­ing en­closed spa­ces like gyms and theatres to open. A cou­ple of ‘su­per spread­ers’ in­side a closed hall with low cir­cu­la­tion is ex­tremely dan­ger­ous.</p>
    <p>DR T. SUNDARARAM­AN, global co­or­di­na­tor for the Peo­ple’s Health Move­ment, on de­ci­sions that are not based on re­search.</p>
    <p>In­dia is push­ing ahead with re­open­ing its econ­omy even as it is set to over­take the United States in terms of hav­ing the largest num­ber of Covid-19 cases.</p>
    <p>Cin­e­mas will be al­lowed to open this week, while the re­open­ing of schools is be­ing widely de­bated.</p>
    <p>In­dia has nearly 7.2 mil­lion con­firmed coro­n­avirus cases, but faced with a bat­tered econ­omy and wide­spread job losses, the gov­ern­ment is con­tin­u­ing to loosen re­stric­tions.</p>
    <p>Schools can fi­nally re­open af­ter be­ing closed for eight months.</p>
    <p>On Sept 30, the Home Min­istry re­leased new guide­lines that said all schools could be grad­u­ally opened af­ter Oct 15. But stu­dent at­ten­dance would not be manda­tory, and on­line learn­ing would be pre­ferred.</p>
    <p>Last week, the Ed­u­ca­tion Min­istry is­sued a 54-page stan­dard oper­at­ing pro­ce­dure for schools that in­cluded di­rec­tions for phys­i­cal dis­tanc­ing, sani­tis­ing pro­to­cols, stag­gered sched­ules and shorter class pe­ri­ods.</p>
    <p>How­ever, state gov­ern­ments have the fi­nal say on if and how schools can re­open. Pun­jab and Ut­tar Pradesh have al­lowed cer­tain schools to open from this month, but other states will de­cide later in the month, or af­ter the fes­ti­val of Di­wali next month.</p>
    <p>A sur­vey last month by Lo­calCir­cles, a cit­i­zen en­gage­ment or­gan­i­sa­tion, found that more than 70 per cent of par­ents said they would not send their chil­dren to school.</p>
    <p>Kar­nataka state has even ceased oper­at­ing its on­line teach­ing cen­tres for poor school­child­ren who do not oth­er­wise have ac­cess to TV or mo­bile phones, over in­fec­tion fears.</p>
    <p>A World Bank re­port pub­lished ear­lier this week said the pro­longed clo­sure of schools in In­dia could cost the coun­try more than US$400 bil­lion (S$544 bil­lion) in fu­ture earn­ings and se­ri­ous learn­ing losses.</p>
    <p>Child rights ac­tivists have al­ready sounded the alarm about poor chil­dren slip­ping back into labour and un­der­age mar­riages.</p>
    <p>Covid-19-re­lated mor­tal­ity among those un­der 17 years old is only 0.05 per cent. How­ever, a large study of trans­mis­sion pat­terns in Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu pub­lished last month in Science sug­gests that chil­dren could be silent spread­ers of the coro­n­avirus, as they do not show any symp­toms.</p>
    <p>The study found that chil­dren of all ages can con­tract Covid-19 and in­fect oth­ers.</p>
    <p>Even as the school de­bate rages, cin­e­mas are set to open with lit­tle dis­cus­sion.</p>
    <p>Last week, the In­for­ma­tion and Broad­cast­ing Min­istry re­leased guide­lines on how cin­e­mas could re­open and op­er­ate. Au­di­to­ri­ums can only fill half their seats and will have to stag­ger show tim­ings to pre­vent crowd­ing.</p>
    <p>Most north and cen­tral In­dian states have said they will al­low cin­e­mas to open from to­mor­row.</p>
    <p>The move has left pub­lic health ex­perts be­wil­dered.</p>
    <p>“Af­ter eight months, we should be able to say what pro­por­tion of trans­mis­sion comes from what ac­tiv­i­ties. But most de­ci­sions are based on the gut in­stinct of key ad­min­is­tra­tors, not prin­ci­ples evolved from data­bases or re­search,” said Dr T. Sundararam­an, the global co­or­di­na­tor for the Peo­ple’s Health Move­ment.</p>
    <p>“Cities are clos­ing beaches and airy parks and keep­ing schools shut, but al­low­ing en­closed spa­ces like gyms and theatres to open. A cou­ple of ‘su­per spread­ers’ in­side a closed hall with low cir­cu­la­tion is ex­tremely dan­ger­ous,” he added.</p>
    <p>As In­dia’s fes­ti­val sea­son will soon kick into top gear with Dussehra and Di­wali, Health Min­is­ter Harsh Vard­han warned cit­i­zens to be care­ful: “There is no need to con­gre­gate in large num­bers to prove your faith or your re­li­gion. If we do this we may be head­ing for big trou­ble.”</p>
