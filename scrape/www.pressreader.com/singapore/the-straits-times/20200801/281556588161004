    <p>SingPass is un­der­go­ing an ex­ten­sive up­grade that will al­low it to se­cure high-risk on­line trans­ac­tions. The up­grade will, in ef­fect, trans­form the 17-year-old tech­nol­ogy into the dig­i­tal equiv­a­lent of the pink NRIC, putting Sin­ga­pore on the world map for be­ing among the first to do so.</p>
    <p>Na­tional authen­ti­ca­tion sys­tem SingPass is un­der­go­ing an ex­ten­sive up­grade that will al­low it to se­cure high-risk on­line trans­ac­tions such as bank ac­count open­ings or fund with­drawals and trans­fers.</p>
    <p>The up­grade will in ef­fect trans­form the 17-year-old tech­nol­ogy into the dig­i­tal equiv­a­lent of the pink NRIC, putting Sin­ga­pore on the world map for be­ing among the first to do so.</p>
    <p>Its de­vel­oper, GovTech, has started a ten­der process to find a con­trac­tor to build real-time fraud de­tec­tion ca­pa­bil­i­ties sim­i­lar to those used in the fi­nan­cial ser­vice sec­tor to spot iden­tity theft and ac­count takeover at­tempts.</p>
    <p>The up­grade comes amid re­cent moves by OCBC and DBS Bank to use SingPass’ bio­met­ric fea­tures to pro­vide al­ter­na­tive lo­gin ver­i­fi­ca­tion for on­line and mo­bile bank­ing.</p>
    <p>GovTech said in ten­der doc­u­ments seen by The Straits Times: “Sin­ga­pore is de­vel­op­ing a Na­tional Dig­i­tal Iden­tity ecosys­tem, which will pro­vide users with a sin­gle dig­i­tal iden­tity to trans­act with both (the) pub­lic and pri­vate sec­tors se­curely and seam­lessly.”</p>
    <p>The new Iden­tity Fraud An­a­lyt­ics Sys­tem, slated for roll-out early next year, aims to se­curely au­then­ti­cate users’ iden­ti­ties and alert the au­thor­i­ties to un­usual ac­tiv­i­ties.</p>
    <p>These can in­clude the use of vir­tual pri­vate net­works to mask a per­son’s iden­tity and the pres­ence of apps not down­loaded from of­fi­cial stores.</p>
    <p>The new sys­tem will also be able to de­tect bot-ini­ti­ated lo­gins, and the pres­ence of mal­ware, and pre­dict unau­tho­rised de­vice usage by de­tect­ing sub­tle dis­crep­an­cies in user be­hav­iour, for ex­am­ple in the hand swipe or touch pres­sure.</p>
    <p>A GovTech spokesman told The Straits Times that SingPass is mov­ing away from scripted fraud de­tec­tion to us­ing ma­chine learn­ing and ar­ti­fi­cial in­tel­li­gence that can de­tect anom­alies au­to­mat­i­cally.</p>
    <p>The up­grade is “one be­fit­ting a na­tional dig­i­tal iden­tity”, she said.</p>
    <p>“Such se­cu­rity-fo­cused im­prove­ments sup­port pub­lic as well as the grow­ing num­ber of pri­vate sec­tor ser­vices ex­pected to come on board SingPass,” she said.</p>
    <p>The new pos­si­bil­i­ties are not spelt out in the ten­der doc­u­ments. But ex­perts said that the new SingPass will be more ver­sa­tile and pow­er­ful than the pink NRIC for ver­i­fy­ing both on­line and over­the-counter trans­ac­tions.</p>
    <p>The SingPass Mo­bile app, launched in late 2018, al­ready lets its 1.6 mil­lion users store their NRIC bar­code and all sorts of per­sonal de­tails – driver’s li­cence num­ber, mar­riage cer­tifi­cate num­ber, birth records of chil­dren, prop­erty own­er­ship data and Cen­tral Prov­i­dent Fund records – in one place.</p>
    <p>The app can re­place the NRIC in some in­stances where it is needed.</p>
    <p>But soon, peo­ple may also be able to open a bank ac­count by scan­ning their faces on their phones – with­out up­load­ing pic­tures of their NRIC or show­ing up in per­son at the bank.</p>
    <p>They may also au­tho­rise the pur­chase of cashier’s or­ders of over $10,000 – cur­rently done only over the counter – by scan­ning their faces on their phones, thanks to a new ser­vice called SingPass Face Ver­i­fi­ca­tion launched ear­lier this week.</p>
    <p>The fea­ture, which matches cap­tured fa­cial im­ages against the na­tional bio­met­ric database, is be­ing pi­loted by DBS Bank to ver­ify on­line bank ac­count sign-ups.</p>
    <p>Cy­ber-se­cu­rity ex­pert Aloy­sius Cheang of Lon­don’s Cen­tre for Strate­gic Cy­berspace + In­ter­na­tional Stud­ies said: “If SingPass were to se­cure all pub­lic and pri­vate sec­tor trans­ac­tions, the bar must be set higher to pre­vent iden­tity fraud, which is an in­creas­ingly chal­leng­ing prob­lem on­line.”</p>
    <p>GovTech’s ten­der has at­tracted bids rang­ing from $1 mil­lion to $6 mil­lion from five tech­nol­ogy con­sul­tancy and soft­ware firms: Amer­i­can Ex­press In­ter­na­tional, Azaas, Ernst & Young Ad­vi­sory, Master­card Asia Pa­cific and ST Elec­tron­ics (Info-Se­cu­rity).</p>
