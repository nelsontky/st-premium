    <p>OR­LANDO (Florida) • A war of words – both on the court and on so­cial me­dia – erupted be­tween Damian Lil­lard and the Los An­ge­les Clip­pers af­ter sev­eral of their play­ers mocked him fol­low­ing the Port­land Trail Blaz­ers’ 122-117 de­feat on Satur­day.</p>
    <p>The five-time All-Star is known as “Dame Time” for his abil­ity to come up clutch in the dy­ing mo­ments of Na­tional Bas­ket­ball As­so­ci­a­tion (NBA) games.</p>
    <p>But this time, Lil­lard could not step up when it counted at Dis­ney World, miss­ing a pair of key free throws that would have put the Blaz­ers up by one with just un­der 19 sec­onds left.</p>
    <p>With an 89 per cent success rate from the line this sea­son, it seemed like a given he would make the easy bas­kets.</p>
    <p>In­stead, the misses de­mor­alised his team, lead­ing to the even­tual loss and putting Port­land’s chances of qual­i­fy­ing for the play-offs – they have reached the post-sea­son for the past six sea­sons – in se­ri­ous danger.</p>
    <p>The Blaz­ers (32-39), who are ninth in the West­ern Con­fer­ence, are now 11/ games be­hind the Mem</p>
    <p>2 phis Griz­zlies, who hold the eighth and fi­nal berth, with just three reg­u­lar-sea­son games left.</p>
    <p>More crit­i­cally, the de­feat means that the rest of the chas­ing pack,</p>
    <p>Phoenix Suns and San An­to­nio Spurs – 10th and 11th re­spec­tively – are only half a game be­hind them, while the 12th-placed New Or­leans Pel­i­cans are a fur­ther half game back.</p>
    <p>If the eighth-placed team do not fin­ish four games ahead of the team in ninth, those teams must play each other.</p>
    <p>Port­land were stung by the loss against an un­der-strength Clip­pers team (47-22) who chose to rest Fi­nals Most Valu­able Player Kawhi Leonard and Pa­trick Bev­er­ley, and were miss­ing Mon­trezl Har­rell for per­sonal rea­sons.</p>
    <p>It was ex­ac­er­bated by an­i­mated taunts on the side­lines from Clip­pers pair Paul Ge­orge, who paced his team with 21 points, and Bev­er­ley, fol­low­ing Lil­lard’s misses.</p>
    <p>The guard later took ex­cep­tion to the ver­bal jabs, blast­ing the pair in Lil­lard would soon be head­ing for “(Mex­i­can hol­i­day re­sort) Can­cun in three”, while Ge­orge chimed in, adding, “You get­ting sent home this year, re­spect... Dame time run­ning out”.</p>
    <p>Lil­lard fired back, telling Ge­orge to “stop run­ning from the grind” and call­ing the Clip­pers “chumps”.</p>
    <p>While the rest of the Blaz­ers, in­clud­ing C.J. McCol­lum, who led all scor­ers with 29 points, re­fused to get in­volved, the guard ad­mit­ted he was “very sur­prised” his team­mate did not drain the free throws, but in­sisted they win or lose as a team.</p>
    <p>“We’ve got to do a bet­ter job of ex­e­cut­ing and putting them away ear­lier. Es­pe­cially, go­ing against most of their sec­ond-unit guys – we’ve got to do a bet­ter job.”</p>
