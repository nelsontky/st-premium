    <p>SEOUL • South Korea yes­ter­day out­lined a plan to spend 114.1 tril­lion won (S$132 bil­lion) on a “New Deal” to cre­ate jobs and help the econ­omy re­cover from the coro­n­avirus fall­out, an­chored in part by “green” in­vest­ment in elec­tric ve­hi­cles and hy­dro­gen cars.</p>
    <p>The six-year plan will build dig­i­tal in­fra­struc­ture and a stronger safety net for job seek­ers, but its “Green New Deal” as­pects have drawn at­ten­tion as they aim to cut heavy reliance on fos­sil fu­els i n Asia’s fourth-largest econ­omy.</p>
    <p>“The coro­n­avirus pan­demic once again reaf­firmed the ur­gency of re­sponses to cli­mate change,” Pres­i­dent Moon Jae-in said in a speech, adding that the new projects were ex­pected to cre­ate about 1.9 mil­lion jobs through 2025.</p>
    <p>The plan en­vis­ages in­vest­ment in smart grids to man­age elec­tric­ity use more ef­fi­ciently, pro­mo­tion of re­mote med­i­cal ser­vices, a work­from-home pol­icy for busi­nesses and on­line schools based on 5G wire­less net­works, and tax breaks for tele­coms providers which in­stall the sys­tems.</p>
    <p>First pro­posed by Mr Moon’s rul­ing party ahead of the par­lia­men­tary elec­tion in April, the plan sets am­bi­tious goals of net-zero emis­sions by 2050, an end to fund­ing of over­seas coal plants, and in­tro­duc­tion of a car­bon tax.</p>
    <p>But en­vi­ron­men­tal groups crit­i­cised the ini­tia­tives as light on mea­sures to rein in emis­sions.</p>
    <p>“This is a half-baked (plan) that lacks the goal of curb­ing car­bon emis­sions to net zero by 2050 and a road map to reach that,” Green­peace Korea said in a state­ment.</p>
    <p>Law­maker Lee So-young, who is help­ing to draft the leg­is­la­tion, de­fended the lack of a time­line to phase out ve­hi­cles with in­ter­nal com­bus­tion en­gines, say­ing it could be chal­leng­ing for ma­jor auto ex­porters like South Korea to adopt one: “It’s eas­ier for auto-im­port ori­ented coun­tries like the United King­dom to set a time­line.”</p>
    <p>South Korea aims to have 1.13 mil­lion elec­tric ve­hi­cles (EVs) and 200,000 hy­dro­gen cars on the roads by 2025, up from 91,000 and 5,000 each by the end of 2019, Mr Moon said, while the gov­ern­ment would add more charg­ing sta­tions for the ve­hi­cles.</p>
    <p>Hyundai Mo­tor l eader Euisun Chung said the flag­ship com­pany and sib­ling Kia Mo­tors aim to sell one mil­lion EVs in 2025, to­gether tar­get­ing more than a tenth of global mar­ket share.</p>
    <p>He said Hyundai Mo­tor also plans to launch a next-gen­er­a­tion elec­tric ve­hi­cle with a range of 450km for every charge, which will take 20 min­utes or less.</p>
    <p>It aims to ex­port 1,600 hy­dro­gen­pow­ered trucks to Europe by 2025, and de­velop a new sys­tem that dou­bles bat­tery life at half the price, he said. That sys­tem will suit ships, trains, air­craft, build­ings, power plants and mil­i­tary pur­poses.</p>
    <p>Last week, Seoul said it would in­vest 2.6 tril­lion won in its own ver­sion of the green deal, and set a 2035 dead­line to stop reg­is­tra­tion of ve­hi­cles with in­ter­nal com­bus­tion en­gines. It also vowed to con­vert 4,000 of its fleet of 7,396 pub­lic buses to elec­tric or hy­dro­gen power by 2025, and give more con­ver­sion in­cen­tives for new taxis.</p>
    <p>Seoul also plans 4,000 charg­ing sta­tions for EVs and 65 for hy­dro­gen-pow­ered cars by 2035, up from 1,090 sta­tions for EVs and four for such cars now.</p>
