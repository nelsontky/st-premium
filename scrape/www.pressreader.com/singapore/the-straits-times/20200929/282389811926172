    <p>The lat­est Gill­man Bar­racks ten­ant to say it will leave the arts en­clave is Aus­tralian gallery Sul­li­van+ Strumpf. It will move out in Novem­ber, but re­main in Sin­ga­pore, co­founder Joanna Strumpf tells The Straits Times, adding that the on­go­ing Vi­o­lent At­tach­ments ex­hi­bi­tion will be its last show there.</p>
    <p>“Un­for­tu­nately at this stage, it is pre­ma­ture to share any fur­ther in­for­ma­tion un­til ar­range­ments are in place,” she says. She did not con­firm if the move was the re­sult of the fall­out from Covid-19.</p>
    <p>This comes af­ter Chan + Hori Con­tem­po­rary left at the end of June to fo­cus on be­com­ing a cu­ra­to­rial, ad­vi­sory and artist man­age­ment busi­ness. More re­cently, NTU Cen­tre for Con­tem­po­rary Art Sin­ga­pore, helmed by renowned cu­ra­tor Ute Meta Bauer, has also said it will close its ex­hi­bi­tion hall and res­i­dency stu­dio spa­ces in March next year.</p>
    <p>The Gill­man Bar­racks clus­ter off Alexan­dra Road was es­tab­lished by the Na­tional Arts Coun­cil (NAC), Sin­ga­pore Eco­nomic Devel­op­ment Board and JTC Cor­po­ra­tion.</p>
    <p>Since it opened in 2012, it has seen its share of set­backs. In 2015, five of 17 gal­leries de­cided not to re­new their leases, cit­ing low foot­fall and poor sales.</p>
    <p>Ms Au­drey Yeo, whose gallery Yeo Work­shop is sit­u­ated in the en­clave, thinks the district could do with bet­ter mar­ket­ing and sup­port.</p>
    <p>“These are the top gal­leries in the re­gion... We love the beauty of Gill­man Bar­racks and the beau­ti­ful high ceil­ings... We do (typ­i­cally) get a lot of ca­sual tourists and young peo­ple, but in terms of get­ting the crowd that can buy art... it just needs a re­ju­ve­na­tion, hon­estly.”</p>
    <p>Does the NAC plan to re­ju­ve­nate the arts district?</p>
    <p>Mr Tay Tong, the coun­cil’s di­rec­tor for sec­tor devel­op­ment (visual arts), tells ST: “A vi­brant arts in­dus­try in Sin­ga­pore will con­tinue to need the col­lec­tive en­er­gies of all stake­hold­ers – arts pa­trons and col­lec­tors, artists and gal­leries – as well as the strong sup­port of the public.</p>
    <p>“This does not nec­es­sar­ily re­quire the build-up of a des­ig­nated precinct to clus­ter ac­tiv­i­ties. As seen in the Sin­ga­pore Art Week over the years, dif­fer­ent seg­ments of visual arts ac­tiv­i­ties tend to zone to­gether or­gan­i­cally at the Civic District, Bras Basah/Water­loo, Gill­man Bar­racks and so on.”</p>
    <p>The NAC will, where it can, sup­port the gal­leries at Gill­man Bar­racks for as long as they wish to main­tain their busi­ness in Sin­ga­pore, he said.</p>
    <p>He added that for­mer gallery ten­ants such as The Draw­ing Room and Sil­ver­lens Gal­leries were also in­vited to present shows at the S.E.A. Fo­cus fair at Gill­man Bar­racks in Jan­uary this year.</p>
    <p>At Sin­ga­pore Art Week, the in­volve­ment of com­mer­cial gal­leries re­mains vi­tal, he said.</p>
    <p>Last month, gal­leries at t he en­clave sub­mit­ted a pe­ti­tion to the Sin­ga­pore Land Au­thor­ity (SLA), ask­ing it to waive rent till next March and re­duce it by about half af­ter that.</p>
    <p>“We asked for a rental waiver to keep some of our won­der­ful neigh­bours... If we can take away that bit of rent, that money can go into pro­gram­ming at a time like this, when it’s un­cer­tain,” says Ms Yeo.</p>
    <p>How­ever, SLA, which took over from JTC Cor­po­ra­tion as land­lord more than half a year ago, says it is “un­able to of­fer rental ad­just­ments while the ten­an­cies are on­go­ing”.</p>
    <p>It told ST it had al­ready granted four months’ rental waiver to the gal­leries from April to July, and had of­fered a rental re­duc­tion for their two-year ten­ancy which had be­gun on March 1.</p>
    <p>“For ten­ants which are fac­ing cash-flow dif­fi­culty, flex­i­ble rental pay­ments such as in­stal­ment plans can be of­fered to help ten­ants who wish to stay on. Ten­ants are also en­cour­aged to tap the var­i­ous gov­ern­ment sup­port pack­ages avail­able, in­clud­ing wage sub­si­dies un­der the Jobs Sup­port Scheme.”</p>
    <p>In March last year, Pearl Lam Gal­leries moved out of Gill­man Bar­racks to Dempsey Hill. It has since closed that gallery space, but re­tains an of­fice in Sin­ga­pore with two full-time staff.</p>
    <p>“We have been look­ing for the right op­por­tu­nity to open a phys­i­cal gallery and had planned it for this year, but given the Covid-19 sit­u­a­tion, we are re-strate­gis­ing our plans,” says se­nior di­rec­tor of global sales Priya Mud­gal.</p>
