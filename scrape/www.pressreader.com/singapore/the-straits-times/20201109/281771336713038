    <p>•</p>
    <p>After the dec­la­ra­tion that Demo­crat Joe Bi­den had won the race for the White House, Repub­li­can Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump and his al­lies made one thing clear: He does not plan to con­cede any time soon.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump pledged last Satur­day to go for­ward with a le­gal strat­egy that he hopes will over­turn state re­sults that gave Mr Bi­den the win in the Nov 3 election.</p>
    <p>Trump aides and Repub­li­can al­lies, while con­flicted on how to pro­ceed, largely sup­ported his strat­egy or re­mained silent.</p>
    <p>“The sim­ple fact is this election is far from over. Joe Bi­den has not been cer­ti­fied as the win­ner of any states, let alone any of the highly con­tested states headed for manda­tory re­counts, or states where our cam­paign has valid and le­git­i­mate le­gal chal­lenges that could de­ter­mine the ul­ti­mate vic­tor,” Mr Trump said on Satur­day.</p>
    <p>In a se­ries of tweets yes­ter­day, he again al­leged foul play, writ­ing: “We’re see­ing a num­ber of af­fi­davits that there has been voter fraud. We have a his­tory in this coun­try of election prob­lems.”</p>
    <p>In an­other tweet, he said: “This was a stolen election.”</p>
    <p>Twit­ter flagged the posts, warn­ing read­ers that the claims of election fraud are dis­puted.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump’s al­lies and ad­vis­ers have pri­vately ad­mit­ted that his chances of over­turn­ing the re­sults are slim. While pre­par­ing for an even­tual con­ces­sion, they called for time to let the le­gal chal­lenges run their course.</p>
    <p>The Trump cam­paign has brought nu­mer­ous law­suits al­leg­ing election ir­reg­u­lar­i­ties. Judges have dis­missed cases in Ge­or­gia,</p>
    <p>Michi­gan and Ne­vada. In Penn­syl­va­nia, judges or­dered some pro­vi­sional bal­lots set aside and granted Repub­li­can ob­servers greater ac­cess to vote count­ing.</p>
    <p>Le­gal ex­perts said the le­gal chal­lenges were too nar­row in scope to im­pact the out­come.</p>
    <p>A hand­ful of Repub­li­can Party or GOP rep­re­sen­ta­tives in the House have, how­ever, vig­or­ously de­fended Mr Trump.</p>
    <p>Louisiana Rep­re­sen­ta­tive Steve Scalise, the sec­ond-rank­ing GOP House leader, tweeted that there were “se­ri­ous le­gal chal­lenges” yet to be re­solved.</p>
    <p>Some of Mr Trump’s most vo­cal al­lies in Congress also fol­lowed his lead by say­ing the election has not yet been de­cided, though most did not repeat his ac­cu­sa­tions of widespread fraud.</p>
    <p>Mis­souri Sen­a­tor Josh Haw­ley fo­cused on the me­dia or­gan­i­sa­tions that called the election in Mr Bi­den’s favour, say­ing that is not how the win­ner is de­ter­mined.</p>
    <p>“When all law­ful votes have</p>
    <p>been counted, re­counts fin­ished and al­le­ga­tions of fraud ad­dressed, we will know who the win­ner is,” Mr Haw­ley tweeted.</p>
    <p>Mr Mitt Rom­ney of Utah was the first Se­nate Repub­li­can to con­grat­u­late Mr Bi­den. He was also the only Repub­li­can to vote to con­vict Mr Trump and toss him from of­fice dur­ing his im­peach­ment trial in Jan­uary.</p>
    <p>Re­tir­ing se­nior Repub­li­can Sen­a­tor La­mar Alexan­der of Ten­nessee re­leased a state­ment that seemed to warn Mr Trump over dis­put­ing the fi­nal out­come.</p>
    <p>“After count­ing ev­ery valid vote and al­low­ing courts to re­solve dis­putes, it is im­por­tant to re­spect and promptly ac­cept the re­sult,” Mr Alexan­der said. “The or­derly trans­fer or reaf­firm­ing of im­mense power after a pres­i­den­tial election is the most en­dur­ing sym­bol of our democ­racy.”</p>
    <p>Repub­li­cans fear Mr Trump could tar­nish his own legacy if he does not make a grace­ful exit.</p>
    <p>Fox News host Laura In­gra­ham, a staunch Trump de­fender, last Fri­day urged that, if and when the time came, the Pres­i­dent should ac­cept an un­favourable out­come with “grace and com­po­sure”.</p>
    <p>CNN re­ported late on Satur­day that Mr Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kush­ner had ap­proached him about con­ced­ing.</p>
    <p>And Mr Ari Fleis­cher, a press sec­re­tary in the Ge­orge W. Bush ad­min­is­tra­tion, said: “Pres­i­dent Trump is en­ti­tled to take the time he wants to ab­sorb this... The best thing to keep this coun­try to­gether is to give the Pres­i­dent a rea­son­able pe­riod of time to ac­cept the re­sults.”</p>
    <p>NO CON­FIR­MA­TION YET</p>
    <p>The sim­ple fact is this election is far from over. Joe Bi­den has not been cer­ti­fied as the win­ner of any states, let alone any of the highly con­tested states headed for manda­tory re­counts, or states where our cam­paign has valid and le­git­i­mate le­gal chal­lenges that could de­ter­mine the ul­ti­mate vic­tor.</p>
