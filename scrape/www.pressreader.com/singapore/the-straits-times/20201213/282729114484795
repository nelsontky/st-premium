    <p>Now that the ex­cite­ment about dis­cov­er­ing vac­cines to com­bat Covid-19 has some­what cli­maxed, the fo­cus is turn­ing to how to get these pre­ven­tive shots from lab­o­ra­to­ries and into the im­mune sys­tems of ea­gerly wait­ing pa­tients with­out con­tam­i­na­tion along the way, or loss of po­tency.</p>
    <p>In­deed, that may prove the dif­fi­cult part, es­pe­cially in an Asia where tem­per­a­tures in some parts can rise to 50 deg C, as­phalt-cov­ered roads can some­times be a mem­ory, and dis­tances from ware­houses to vil­lages vast as in coun­tries like In­done­sia or the Philip­pines.</p>
    <p>Zuel­lig Pharma, the No. 1 dis­trib­u­tor of vac­cines in Asia out­side China and Ja­pan, says it is up for the chal­lenge, and has been for a while.</p>
    <p>“It seems eas­ier to dis­cover a vac­cine than to dis­trib­ute it,” says chief ex­ec­u­tive John Gra­ham. “You want to vac­ci­nate as much of the pop­u­la­tion as you can, which means you’re go­ing to have huge vol­umes of vac­cines com­ing to a coun­try, and these have to be stored and dis­trib­uted with no break­down in the cold chain.</p>
    <p>“We’ve been pre­par­ing for this for some time. We have prob­a­bly the best cold chain ca­pac­ity – more than that, we have stan­dard op­er­at­ing pro­ce­dures in place to man­age vac­cines.”</p>
    <p>Zuel­lig, he says, has the ca­pac­ity to han­dle vac­cines at tem­per­a­tures as low as -20 deg C. Now, the ef­fort is to be able to dis­trib­ute vac­cines at tem­per­a­tures be­low -70 deg C.</p>
    <p>In ev­ery coun­try, ca­pac­ity ex­pan­sion is tak­ing this re­quire­ment into ac­count. In the Philip­pines, one of the worst af­fected coun­tries in Asia, the com­pany al­ready has ca­pac­ity to store prod­ucts at -20 deg C and will add 10 med­i­cal grade freez­ers to aug­ment its ex­ist­ing ca­pac­ity in -80 deg C stor­age. It will also add five new cold cham­bers in the Philip­pines, in­clud­ing three in Manila, and one each in Cebu and Davao from next Jan­uary.</p>
    <p>In In­done­sia, through its sub­sidiary APL, the com­pany opened a Na­tional Dis­tri­bu­tion Cen­tre in West Java, the largest in the coun­try, span­ning 39,930 sq m. The ware­house has three dif­fer­ent tem­per­a­ture-con­trolled en­vi­ron­ments and ad­vanced mon­i­tor­ing sys­tems. In ad­di­tion, APL man­ages cold rooms in 26 branches in 15 cities across the na­tion, mak­ing the ca­pac­ity much more re­silient than ca­pac­ity based on re­frig­er­a­tors.</p>
    <p>In Cam­bo­dia, the con­struc­tion of a new US$6 mil­lion (S$8 mil­lion), 6,300 sq m ware­house is un­der way. Eleven times that amount is be­ing spent to ex­pand the Tai­wan fa­cil­i­ties. In South Korea, one of its best mar­kets by value, cold chain ca­pac­ity was raised by more than a quar­ter this year.</p>
    <p>“There’s a good chance of vac­ci­nat­ing ev­ery­one in Asia, the ques­tion is in what time frame,” says Mr Gra­ham, an in­dus­try vet­eran who has worked in four con­ti­nents. “That’s dif­fi­cult to pre­dict. We have brought for­ward our ex­pan­sion plans to en­sure that the vac­cine will be ac­ces­si­ble to those who need them most and are able to ramp up ca­pac­ity quickly when needed.”</p>
    <p>Zuel­lig cur­rently has over 80 dis­tri­bu­tion cen­tres in 13 mar­kets across Asia. Be­hind the phys­i­cal is dig­i­tal: eZTracker, an in-house block chain so­lu­tion that en­ables full trace­abil­ity dur­ing the dis­tri­bu­tion of the vac­cine to ru­ral ar­eas through­out Asia.</p>
    <p>The glam part of the pharma in­dus­try has al­ways been the pic­ture of all those white-coated nerds peer­ing over for­mu­la­tions in highly con­trolled en­vi­ron­ments, con­jur­ing up the next life-sav­ing drug or mir­a­cle that can ac­cu­rately drug-bomb the ail­ing part of your sys­tem with­out caus­ing col­lat­eral dam­age to other or­gans or sur­round­ing tis­sue.</p>
    <p>What Covid-19 has done is to bring home the in­sight that lo­gis­tics is an es­sen­tial ser­vice. This has boosted the con­fi­dence of firms such as Zuel­lig and helped them carve out their spe­cial space in the health­care ecosys­tem.</p>
    <p>Ear­lier in the year, move­ment con­trols mush­roomed as coun­tries went into lock­down. While Zuel­lig had a busi­ness con­ti­nu­ity plan, it had to be ac­ti­vated and, more im­por­tantly, adapted to the ac­tual en­vi­ron­ment. It wasn’t just about get­ting trucks past check­points. Life-sav­ing drugs had to be given pri­or­ity, co­or­di­na­tion was needed be­tween fed­eral and state gov­ern­ments.</p>
    <p>“We were very well pre­pared. We didn’t have a lot of sit­u­a­tions where things didn’t work,” says Mr Gra­ham. “We had some de­lays and had to pri­ori­tise life-sav­ing drugs, had to re­de­ploy staff to the right places within the or­gan­i­sa­tion and work closely with lo­cal and na­tional gov­ern­ments to get the right per­mits to move around when ev­ery­one else wasn’t al­lowed to do so.”</p>
    <p>Zuel­lig typ­i­cally used com­mer­cial air­planes to ferry its cargo but those dis­ap­peared with the travel bans. Ditto with sea freight. And it wasn’t just about planes and trucks, it was also about get­ting em­ploy­ees to work and be back home at night. Zuel­lig had to im­pro­vise to find room in ware­houses for peo­ple to stay the night, and be fed. There was also the key is­sue of re­duc­ing risk as peo­ple de­liv­ered prod­ucts to hos­pi­tals or met cus­tomers to take or­ders.</p>
    <p>The firm then started ZPUnited in Ac­tion, a vol­un­teer move­ment within the or­gan­i­sa­tion to get peo­ple from other func­tions such as cus­tomer ser­vice and ac­count­ing to work in the ware­house. A cou­ple of thou­sands put up their hands to do pack­ing, pick­ing and other du­ties. Sales rep­re­sen­ta­tives showed up in their cars at ware­houses to help de­liver the drugs they mar­keted.</p>
    <p>“This tagline that we have – mak­ing health­care ac­ces­si­ble – if it was a tagline be­fore, it’s now our DNA,” says Mr Gra­ham. “Peo­ple re­ally feel that they have ac­com­plished it. There’s been a great sense of pride in the last six months. If you ask any of our clients and cus­tomers, al­most with­out ex­cep­tion, there was no break­down in the lo­gis­tics and sup­ply chain.”</p>
    <p>Pri­vately held Zuel­lig, in which Te­masek Hold­ings once held a large stake, op­er­ates three broad busi­ness streams; the core dis­tri­bu­tion busi­ness in­volv­ing a net­work of ware­hous­ing and lo­gis­tics to bring prod­ucts to hos­pi­tals and phar­ma­cies, the ZPT com­mer­cial plat­form that launches and mar­kets prod­ucts, and CareCon­nect, a third party ad­min­is­tra­tor of claims. Un­der­ly­ing it all is An­a­lyt­ics, which takes data and pro­vides in­sights to any­one who wants it.</p>
    <p>On the busi­ness front, the pan­demic, says Mr Gra­ham, has led to a huge shift away from face-to-face ac­tiv­ity. What has hap­pened on the dig­i­tal front over the past six months would have taken five years oth­er­wise and that is im­pact­ing ev­ery­thing from plan­ning for of­fice space to the dis­tri­bu­tion and com­mer­cial­i­sa­tion of the busi­ness. On the radar is de­liv­ery by drones, es­pe­cially in re­mote Asian lo­ca­tions. Firms also need to plan for fu­ture spikes.</p>
    <p>“We re­cently talked about how men­tal health is ex­tremely im­por­tant, es­pe­cially dur­ing a pan­demic,” he says. “Some peo­ple live in multi-gen­er­a­tional house­holds with chil­dren and par­ents at home – not nec­es­sar­ily con­ducive work en­vi­ron­ment. So it’s changed very much how we think about our work­force and how to keep them happy, healthy and mo­ti­vated.”</p>
    <p>Asia, he says, is all prepped up to see a leap in busi­ness. There’s now an ex­pan­sion of univer­sal health­care in the Philip­pines, In­done­sia and Malaysia where more pa­tients are get­ting ac­cess to re­im­bursed health­care. On the other hand, in Tai­wan and South Korea where health in­sur­ance al­ready ex­ists, the mar­ket is much more re­cep­tive to tak­ing on new prod­ucts that are in­no­va­tive and cut­ting edge. And in less de­vel­oped mar­kets, the mar­ket is ex­pand­ing across the board.</p>
    <p>Prod­ucts-wise, while prices of an­tibi­otics and an­tivi­rals are dip­ping with the pro­lif­er­a­tion of gener­ics, there is a spurt in the more in­no­va­tive mar­ket, es­pe­cially in anti-can­cer drugs. So, too, with drugs tar­get­ing au­toim­mune diseases, and di­a­betes – a life­style curse.</p>
    <p>On the R&D side, a very strong fo­cus in all big pharma and biotech com­pa­nies, are cell ther­apy and gene ther­apy. Ev­ery ma­jor pharma com­pany Zuel­lig works with is work­ing on cus­tomised treat­ments, es­pe­cially in can­cers. Much of the devel­op­ment is tak­ing place in China, where Zuel­lig ex­ited in 2012 when it sold its busi­ness there to an­other party.</p>
    <p>Some time back, there was talk that Zuel­lig may do a share sale but Mr Gra­ham says he is not aware of any plans. There are al­ways enough op­tions to raise money for ex­pan­sion and be­sides, an ini­tial pub­lic of­fer isn’t al­ways the best way. “Right now, we’re quite happy with where we are. We’re not look­ing for pri­vate eq­uity (ei­ther).”</p>
    <p>Raised in Hong Kong, where his fa­ther worked in a Bri­tish bank, and sent to school in Eng­land, Mr Gra­ham has spent a full decade of his ca­reer in Asia, over two stints. I asked him how dif­fer­ent man­ag­ing is in Asia, com­pared with Europe and the Amer­i­cas.</p>
    <p>“Prob­a­bly the most im­por­tant is adapt­abil­ity, to take a step back and look at the en­vi­ron­ment – What works and doesn’t work?” he says. “It’s re­ally im­por­tant to lis­ten to what peo­ple are say­ing and un­der­stand what they’re try­ing to get done, in­stead of be­ing bom­bas­tic and try­ing to dic­tate ev­ery­thing.”</p>
