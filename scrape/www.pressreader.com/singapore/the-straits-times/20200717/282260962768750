    <p>(−175.14) July 16 (+227.51) July 15</p>
    <p>Gloomy eco­nomic fore­casts from here and around the world sent lo­cal shares slid­ing yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The sell-off left the bench­mark Straits Times In­dex (STI) at 2,623.67, down 25.23 points or 0.95 per cent.</p>
    <p>All but five of its 30 com­po­nents closed lower while across the wider mar­ket, losers thumped gain­ers by 349 to 145. There were 1.49 bil­lion shares worth $1.05 bil­lion traded.</p>
    <p>Gent­ing Sin­ga­pore was in the spot­light af­ter its Re­sorts World Sen­tosa (RWS) an­nounced it would be lay­ing off a sig­nif­i­cant num­ber of staff. The prospect of cost sav­ings did noth­ing to lift in­vestor sen­ti­ment, though.</p>
    <p>RWS re­opened to vis­i­tors early this month, but travel re­stric­tions and safe dis­tanc­ing make it un­likely that busi­ness will im­prove quickly.</p>
    <p>Gent­ing Sin­ga­pore ended the day at 76.5 cents, down 2.55 per cent. It was the worst-per­form­ing STI com­po­nent stock for the day.</p>
    <p>Mon­e­tary Author­ity of Sin­ga­pore (MAS) man­ag­ing di­rec­tor Ravi Menon warned there is sub­stan­tial un­cer­tainty over the global eco­nomic out­look, and recovery will not come quickly. He added yes­ter­day that MAS is in talks with the lo­cal banks on cap­i­tal-man­age­ment is­sues, which may in­clude dis­cus­sion over a re­stric­tion of div­i­dend pay­ments.</p>
    <p>DBS ended down 1.28 per cent while OCBC Bank and United Over­seas Bank each lost about 1 per cent.</p>
    <p>Among the smaller caps, Top Glove had a tough day af­ter the United States au­thor­i­ties barred the im­port of its prod­ucts, pos­si­bly over a vi­o­la­tion of labour rules. The stock ended at $6.49, down 11.1 per cent.</p>
    <p>Other health­care stocks that have charted strong gains in re­cent months were also weaker. UG Health­care lost 14.3 per cent to $1.32, while River­stone closed at $3, down 2.3 per cent, and Medtecs In­ter­na­tional dived 19.4 per cent to 52 cents.</p>
    <p>Else­where, the In­ter­na­tional Mon­e­tary Fund warned that the rate of bank­ruptcy for small and medium-sized busi­nesses across 17 coun­tries that it has stud­ied could triple to 12 per cent this year, ver­sus 4 per cent be­fore the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Key mar­kets around the re­gion were also broadly softer yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>In par­tic­u­lar, Shang­hai shares were down 4.5 per cent while the Hang Seng lost 2 per cent. South Korea’s Kospi In­dex closed 0.82 per cent lower as the cen­tral bank kept rates un­changed. Ja­pan was 0.76 per cent down and Aus­tralia ended flat.</p>
    <p>“No mat­ter how much stim­u­lus and fis­cal sugar you try to en­tice con­sumers with, they will not... go on a spend­ing spree un­til they feel con­fi­dent the land­scape is virus­free,” Ax­iCorp’s chief global mar­ket strate­gist Stephen Innes told Agence France-Presse.</p>
