    <p>Let me be­gin my es­say by telling you a story. In 1996, then Sin­ga­pore Prime Min­is­ter Goh Chok Tong was suc­cess­ful in con­ven­ing the in­au­gu­ral meet­ing of the leaders of Asia and Europe, in Bangkok.</p>
    <p>The leaders agreed to es­tab­lish the Asia-Europe Meet­ing. They also agreed to es­tab­lish the Asia-Europe Foun­da­tion (Asef) to pro­mote bet­ter mu­tual un­der­stand­ing be­tween the peo­ples of the two re­gions.</p>
    <p>Fol­low­ing the sum­mit in Bangkok, Mr Goh and my boss at the Min­istry of For­eign Af­fairs, Mr Kishore Mah­bubani, re­quested that I be the found­ing ex­ec­u­tive di­rec­tor of the Asia-Europe Foun­da­tion.</p>
    <p>The 3½ years I spent in that job en­abled me to learn, more deeply, the his­tory of the post-war Euro­pean in­te­gra­tion pro­ject.</p>
    <p>I was par­tic­u­larly struck by the mir­a­cle of rec­on­cil­i­a­tion that had taken place be­tween his­toric en­e­mies, such as be­tween France and Ger­many.</p>
    <p>ASEF: CHINA AND JA­PAN SAY ‘NO’</p>
    <p>At Asef, I pro­posed con­ven­ing a sem­i­nar to con­sider how Asia can learn from the Euro­pean ex­pe­ri­ence of rec­on­cil­ing his­toric en­e­mies.</p>
    <p>To my sur­prise, the gov­er­nors from China and Ja­pan ob­jected to my pro­posal. When I pressed them to ex­plain their ob­jec­tion, they said that their coun­tries were not ready.</p>
    <p>In ex­as­per­a­tion, I said that if they were not ready, more than 50 years after the Pa­cific War had ended, when would they be ready?</p>
    <p>In view of their ob­jec­tions, I had to aban­don my pro­posal.</p>
    <p>There will be no peace in Asia un­less there is peace be­tween China and Ja­pan. It is there­fore im­por­tant for us to help those two great coun­tries to rec­on­cile and to live at peace with each other.</p>
    <p>I co-chair the Ja­pan-Sin­ga­pore Sym­po­sium and the China-Sin­ga­pore Fo­rum. When mis­un­der­stand­ings oc­curred be­tween them, I had tried to ex­plain China to Ja­pan and Ja­pan to China.</p>
    <p>LEE KUAN YEW AND KIICHI MIYAZAWA</p>
    <p>I once sought the ad­vice of the found­ing prime min­is­ter of Sin­ga­pore, Mr Lee Kuan Yew, on what I could do to help China and Ja­pan achieve a his­toric rec­on­cil­i­a­tion.</p>
    <p>He was quite pes­simistic. He told me that he had once asked Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, for­mer prime min­is­ter of Ja­pan, whether the Chi­nese would ever for­give Ja­pan for all the wicked things that Ja­pan did in China, from 1931 to 1945.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to Mr Lee, Mr Miyazawa’s re­ply was “never”.</p>
    <p>I am an op­ti­mist. I am not pre­pared to ac­cept, as in­evitable, that China and Ja­pan will never rec­on­cile.</p>
    <p>Let us ex­am­ine the three im­ped­i­ments to such a rec­on­cil­i­a­tion: (a) the bur­den of his­tory; (b) the com­pet­ing am­bi­tion to lead Asia; and (c) the deficit of strate­gic trust.</p>
    <p>THE BUR­DEN OF HIS­TORY</p>
    <p>It is a his­tor­i­cal fact that Ja­pan in­vaded China in 1931 and waged a war, from 1931 to 1945, in a failed at­tempt to con­quer that coun­try.</p>
    <p>It is also a fact that dur­ing those 14 years, the Ja­panese army com­mit­ted many atroc­i­ties against the Chi­nese peo­ple.</p>
    <p>In Europe, Ger­many was the ag­gres­sor. The Ger­man govern­ment and army had com­mit­ted many crimes against the French and other vic­tims, es­pe­cially the Jews.</p>
    <p>After the war, Ger­many re­pented for all the crimes it had com­mit­ted against the French peo­ple. In re­turn, France for­gave Ger­many. There was re­pen­tance on one side and for­give­ness on the other.</p>
    <p>Why can’t the same thing hap­pen be­tween China and Ja­pan?</p>
    <p>China says that Ja­pan has not re­pented for its wrongs. It says that all the apolo­gies ex­pressed by the leaders of Ja­pan had been nu­anced and had fallen short of a sin­cere apol­ogy.</p>
    <p>Ja­pan de­nies this. It says that its leaders have apol­o­gised on sev­eral oc­ca­sions. Prime min­is­ters Mori­hiro Hosokawa and Tomi­ichi Mu­rayama had apol­o­gised with­out reser­va­tion.</p>
    <p>It states that the prob­lem is on the Chi­nese side. It holds the view that China will never for­give Ja­pan, no mat­ter how many times it apol­o­gises.</p>
    <p>I have of­ten won­dered why Ja­pan finds it so hard to apol­o­gise and China finds it so hard to for­give.</p>
    <p>Why can’t they be­have like the Ger­mans and the French? Is there some­thing in the char­ac­ter, cul­ture and value sys­tems of China and Ja­pan that dis­tin­guish them from the Ger­mans and the French?</p>
    <p>I don’t know the an­swers to the ques­tions.</p>
    <p>The key ques­tion is whether the leaders of the two coun­tries see each other as friends or as en­e­mies. If they see each other as en­e­mies, then the sta­tus quo will con­tinue. How­ever, if they see each other as friends, then many steps can be taken, at all lev­els, to im­prove un­der­stand­ing and to re­duce dis­trust. At the mo­ment, I think they see each other as fren­e­mies, part friend and part en­emy. As long as this is the case, no his­toric rec­on­cil­i­a­tion be­tween them will oc­cur.</p>
    <p>COM­PET­ING AM­BI­TION TO LEAD ASIA</p>
    <p>The sec­ond ob­sta­cle is the com­pet­ing am­bi­tion of China and Ja­pan to be the leader of Asia.</p>
    <p>One of my pre­vi­ous Ja­panese co-chair­men of the Ja­pan-Sin­ga­pore Sym­po­sium was Mr Sho­taro Yachi.</p>
    <p>When he was the deputy for­eign min­is­ter of Ja­pan, he said that China and Ja­pan were strug­gling for lead­er­ship and locked in a ri­valry that would last a long time.</p>
    <p>Both the Chi­nese and the Ja­panese be­lieve in the say­ing that there can only be one tiger on a hill. Both China and Ja­pan want to be that tiger.</p>
    <p>Why can’t we see Asia as not a hill, but a moun­tain range with sev­eral peaks? The Chi­nese tiger can be on top of one peak, the Ja­panese tiger on an­other and the In­dian tiger on a third peak.</p>
    <p>This works as long as the Chi­nese tiger and the Ja­panese tiger are not com­pet­ing to oc­cupy the high­est peak.</p>
    <p>I would re­spect­fully point out to both China and Ja­pan that Asia can­not be dom­i­nated by any one coun­try. There are three ma­jor pow­ers on the con­ti­nent, namely China, Ja­pan and In­dia.</p>
    <p>An ex­tra-re­gional power, the United States, claims to be a res­i­dent power of the re­gion. It is more pow­er­ful than any of the three Asian pow­ers. It will never al­low the re­gion to be dom­i­nated by a re­gional hege­mon.</p>
    <p>My ad­vice to China and Ja­pan is to com­pete, but not to seek to put the other down. It should be a win-win and not a zero-sum com­pe­ti­tion.</p>
    <p>Asia is big enough to ac­com­mo­date a ris­ing China, a ris­ing Ja­pan and a ris­ing In­dia.</p>
    <p>DEFICIT OF STRATE­GIC TRUST</p>
    <p>The third im­ped­i­ment is the deficit of strate­gic trust. It is un­for­tu­nately true that China does not trust Ja­pan, and Ja­pan does not trust China.</p>
    <p>Be­cause they don’t trust each other, they have tended to op­pose each other’s ini­tia­tives and to mis­read each other’s in­ten­tions.</p>
    <p>A few ex­am­ples should suf­fice: China is op­posed to Ja­pan’s quest to be a per­ma­nent mem­ber of the United Na­tions Se­cu­rity Coun­cil; Ja­pan does not sup­port the China-led Asian In­fra­struc­ture In­vest­ment Bank or the Belt and Road Ini­tia­tive.</p>
    <p>The Chi­nese sus­pected that the Ja­panese govern­ment’s de­ci­sion to na­tion­alise the Senkaku or Diaoyu is­lands was in­tended to change the sta­tus quo.</p>
    <p>I don’t think this was the case. The Ja­panese govern­ment had na­tion­alised those is­lands in or­der to pre­vent their pri­vate own­ers from caus­ing trou­ble.</p>
    <p>How to re­duce the mis­trust be­tween China and Ja­pan? How to pro­mote bet­ter un­der­stand­ing and mu­tual trust be­tween them?</p>
    <p>I think the key ques­tion is whether the leaders of the two coun­tries see each other as friends or as en­e­mies.</p>
    <p>If they see each other as en­e­mies, then the sta­tus quo will con­tinue. How­ever, if they see each other as friends, then many steps can be taken, at all lev­els, to im­prove un­der­stand­ing and to re­duce dis­trust.</p>
    <p>At the mo­ment, I think they see each other as fren­e­mies, part friend and part en­emy. As long as this is the case, no his­toric rec­on­cil­i­a­tion be­tween them will oc­cur.</p>
    <p>CON­CLU­SION</p>
    <p>Will there ever be a his­toric rec­on­cil­i­a­tion be­tween China and Ja­pan? The pes­simists say: never. As an op­ti­mist, I think it is pos­si­ble, pro­vided we can over­come the three ob­sta­cles I have de­scribed.</p>
