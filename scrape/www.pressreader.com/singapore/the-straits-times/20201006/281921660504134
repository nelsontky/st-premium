    <p>WELLING­TON • Wild­fires have de­stroyed up to 50 homes in New Zealand, the au­thor­i­ties said yes­ter­day, adding that it was a mir­a­cle no one was hurt as “a wall of orange” razed most of a South Is­land vil­lage.</p>
    <p>The blaze be­gan in a moun­tain for­est early on Sun­day morn­ing and, fanned by strong winds, swept through the vil­lage of Lake Ohau, forc­ing res­i­dents to flee.</p>
    <p>Fire and Emer­gency New Zealand said the un­pre­dictable winds made fight­ing the fire chal­leng­ing and by yes­ter­day af­ter­noon, it had burned 4,600ha of land.</p>
    <p>Waitaki district mayor Gary Kircher said the tiny Lake Ohau com­mu­nity had been dev­as­tated.</p>
    <p>“Of the 60 or 70 houses, we be­lieve that the ma­jor­ity have gone,” he told Ra­dio New Zealand. “The re­al­ity is that it’s a mi­nor mir­a­cle no one has been harmed. If it had been an­other 15-20 minutes, it would have been a very dif­fer­ent story.”</p>
    <p>Mr Kircher de­scribed how res­i­dents awoke to find an in­ferno bear­ing down on them. “I talked to a gen­tle­man who got up to his dog (bark­ing) in the early hours, opened his door and there was this wall of orange,” he said. “He was the one who set off the town fire alarm and helped to wake peo­ple.”</p>
    <p>Wild­fires are rel­a­tively com­mon on the South Is­land at this time of the year but the scale and in­ten­sity of the Ohau fire have been un­usual.</p>
    <p>Vil­lage res­i­dent Hugh Spiers, who lost his home, said the fe­ro­cious blaze was sur­real and more akin to the huge bush fires that reg­u­larly erupt in Aus­tralia than a reg­u­lar New Zealand blaze.</p>
    <p>By yes­ter­day af­ter­noon, the fire front had moved far enough from the vil­lage to al­low evac­u­ated res­i­dents a brief trip back to as­sess the dam­age. Civil De­fence Min­is­ter Peeni Henare, who ac­com­pa­nied them, de­scribed see­ing burnt cars and gut­ted homes. “The term I’ve heard used to describe it is a war zone,” he told re­porters.</p>
    <p>The fire de­part­ment said 11 he­li­copters and eight fire crews were at­tempt­ing to con­tain the flames. In­ves­ti­ga­tors were ex­am­in­ing the cause of the blaze, amid re­ports that it was ig­nited by an elec­tri­cal arc from over­head power lines.</p>
    <p>With light rain forecast for the next 24 hours, there were hopes it would be un­der con­trol by tonight.</p>
    <p>Univer­sity of Auck­land en­vi­ron­men­tal sci­ence ex­pert Ge­orge Perry said it was dif­fi­cult to at­tribute a spe­cific event such as the Lake Ohau fire to cli­mate change. But he said New Zealand had ex­pe­ri­enced more large wild­fires than usual in re­cent years, point­ing to changes in the three main fac­tors: fuel, cli­mate and ig­ni­tion sources.</p>
    <p>“We would ex­pect more such events un­der cli­mate change, es­pe­cially as con­di­tions be­come warmer and drier, and we see more droughts,” Pro­fes­sor Perry said.</p>
