    <p>Over 5,000 work­ers from Changi Air­port Ter­mi­nal 3 have tested neg­a­tive for Covid-19, the Min­istry of Health (MOH) said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The min­istry an­nounced on Oct 24 that all in­di­vid­u­als work­ing at T3 who may have con­tact with trav­ellers will be tested for Covid-19, af­ter two em­ploy­ees there tested pos­i­tive for the coro­n­avirus.</p>
    <p>In to­tal, 5,084 em­ploy­ees at T3 have been tested thus far, and all re­sults have re­turned neg­a­tive.</p>
    <p>An­other 33 re­main­ing work­ers who have yet to be swabbed have been tem­po­rar­ily sus­pended from du­ties un­til they test neg­a­tive, said MOH. It is work­ing with the Civil Avi­a­tion Au­thor­ity of Sin­ga­pore to have them tested.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, four new im­ported cases were re­ported, tak­ing Sin­ga­pore’s to­tal to 58,047.</p>
    <p>No new cases from the com­mu­nity or within work­ers’ dor­mi­to­ries were an­nounced.</p>
    <p>Among the four im­ported cases, three are cur­rently em­ployed here.</p>
    <p>Of these, one is a work pass holder. The 31-year-old French woman ar­rived from France.</p>
    <p>An­other is a 30-year-old fe­male Filipino work per­mit holder who ar­rived from the Philip­pines.</p>
    <p>The last pa­tient work­ing here is a 34-year-old Bri­tish en­gi­neer. He is hold­ing a short-term visit pass and ar­rived here from the United King­dom for a work project.</p>
    <p>All three had been placed on stay-home no­tices upon ar­rival in Sin­ga­pore and were tested while serv­ing their no­tices.</p>
    <p>The re­main­ing im­ported pa­tient is a spe­cial pass holder who is a crew mem­ber of a ship that ar­rived from the United States. The 25-year-old Amer­i­can woman had not dis­em­barked and was swabbed on board the ves­sel upon its ar­rival here.</p>
    <p>MOH added that the clus­ter at Tuas South Dor­mi­tory has been closed as there have been no new cases linked to it for two in­cu­ba­tion pe­ri­ods, or 28 days.</p>
    <p>In a sep­a­rate state­ment yes­ter­day, the Health and Man­power min­istries said work­ers who have re­cov­ered from Covid-19 have been ex­empted from ros­tered rou­tine test­ing since Wed­nes­day, with some ex­cep­tions. Those who show symp­toms sug­ges­tive of acute res­pi­ra­tory ill­ness 90 days af­ter con­tract­ing Covid-19 will con­tinue to be tested for the virus.</p>
    <p>Be­ing the ear­li­est co­hort of work­ers in Sin­ga­pore to have re­cov­ered from Covid-19, those who ex­pe­ri­enced the on­set of ill­ness be­fore April 16 will also un­dergo mon­i­tor­ing tests to help the au­thor­i­ties de­cide when to re­sume rou­tine test­ing for other re­cov­ered work­ers.</p>
