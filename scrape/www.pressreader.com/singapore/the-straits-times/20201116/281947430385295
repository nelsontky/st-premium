    <p>Day-to-day ser­vices have been mov­ing on­line, with the pandemic ac­cel­er­at­ing the process. This has made ac­cess­ing them con­ve­nient for many, but less so for some.</p>
    <p>While the pro­vi­sion of Skills Fu­ture funds may get peo­ple to up­grade them­selves, in­clud­ing pick­ing up dig­i­tal skills, I do not think ev­ery­one will make use of the op­por­tu­nity. For some, the dig­i­tal skills gap will re­main.</p>
    <p>Take, for ex­am­ple, my two grand­moth­ers. Both of them are el­i­gi­ble to tap the funds to up­skill them­selves, but they face dif­fer­ent bar­ri­ers.</p>
    <p>One grand­mother is un­will­ing to learn how to use a mo­bile phone or at­tend any course.</p>
    <p>The other is keen to learn how to use a phone, but is il­lit­er­ate. Thus her abil­ity to adapt to more on­line ser­vices will be lim­ited even if she at­tends cour­ses, as she is un­likely to un­der­stand the in­creas­ingly wordy in­for­ma­tion on dig­i­tal plat­forms.</p>
    <p>Both my grand­moth­ers are for­tu­nate as they can get help from fam­ily mem­bers. But what about se­niors who do not have chil­dren, close con­nec­tions or so­cial work­ers to ac­cess the dig­i­tal world on their be­half?</p>
    <p>Skills Fu­ture or Trace To­gether to­kens may bridge the skills and hard­ware gap in the short term, but how do we help those who may be too old or too un­will­ing, or who do not pos­sess the skills, to ac­cess on­line ser­vices?</p>
    <p>How do we help them live em­pow­ered lives in­stead of feel­ing left be­hind or even de­nied ac­cess to cru­cial ser­vices?</p>
    <p>I pro­pose the set­ting up of a “dig­i­tal bridge” of­fice, where all who face dig­i­tal prob­lems can walk in to seek help the pre-dig­i­tal way.</p>
    <p>These of­fices can have am­bas­sadors who di­rect se­niors to the cor­rect plat­forms to book ap­point­ments or pay bills, or guide them in nav­i­gat­ing gov­ern­ment dig­i­tal ser­vices.</p>
    <p>On­line plat­forms could also have dif­fer­ent ac­ces­si­bil­ity set­tings to help not only those who are il­lit­er­ate but also those with dis­abil­i­ties. They can fea­ture icons, text-to-speech func­tions or other fea­tures cre­ated in con­sul­ta­tion with these tar­get groups. The ded­i­cated “dig­i­tal bridge” of­fice could also be a multi-min­istry node to roll out ac­ces­si­bil­ity rec­om­men­da­tions.</p>
    <p>The con­ve­nience pro­vided by dig­i­tal­i­sa­tion and au­to­ma­tion should be ex­pe­ri­enced by all, and not just by those who can use tech­nol­ogy.</p>
