    <p>The deal es­tab­lish­ing ties be­tween the United Arab Emi­rates and Is­rael comes at a his­toric mo­ment. While it will not bring peace to the re­gion, it marks a gen­er­a­tional shift in view on the Pales­tine is­sue, says global af­fairs cor­re­spon­dent Jonathan Eyal (be­low).</p>
    <p>It was all clas­sic Don­ald Trump; the an­nounce­ment of a ground-break­ing deal es­tab­lish­ing diplo­matic re­la­tions be­tween the United Arab Emi­rates (UAE) and Is­rael was made not by the lead­ers of the two coun­tries, not at the end of some cliffhange­r ses­sion of an in­ter­na­tional con­fer­ence, but through the Amer­i­can Pres­i­dent’s Twit­ter ac­count.</p>
    <p>The usual su­perla­tive boasts fol­lowed. Mr Trump called the Is­rael-UAE deal “a truly his­toric mo­ment”. Mr Mike Pom­peo, his Sec­re­tary of State, hailed the agree­ment as “a re­mark­able achieve­ment for two of the world’s most for­ward lean­ing, tech­no­log­i­cally ad­vanced states, re­flect­ing their shared re­gional vi­sion of an eco­nom­i­cally in­te­grated re­gion”.</p>
    <p>Mr Jared Kush­ner, the US Pres­i­dent’s son-in-law – who was in­stru­men­tal in get­ting Is­rael and the UAE to shake hands – help­fully ex­plained that he de­cided to name the deal the “Abra­ham Ac­cord”, after the fa­ther of monothe­is­tic re­li­gions founded in the Mid­dle East – Christiani­ty, Is­lam and Ju­daism.</p>
    <p>And not to be un­done, US Na­tional Se­cu­rity Ad­viser Robert O’Brien added that con­clud­ing the ac­cord now means that Pres­i­dent Trump “should be a front run­ner” for the No­bel Peace Prize.</p>
    <p>One can never an­tic­i­pate what the five Nor­we­gian judges in Oslo may do with their peace prize. But one thing is for cer­tain: The Is­rael-UAE deal will not bring peace to the Mid­dle East. None­the­less, the doc­u­ment is the out­come of a broader geopo­lit­i­cal align­ment which is re­draw­ing the strate­gic map of the Mid­dle East. So at least in this sense, this is a his­toric mo­ment.</p>
    <p>ROLE OF DIPLO­MATIC RE­LA­TIONS</p>
    <p>The con­duct of diplo­matic re­la­tions is such a ba­sic prin­ci­ple of in­ter­ac­tion be­tween es­tab­lished states that it is al­most im­pos­si­ble to de­scribe its unique sig­nif­i­cance in the con­text of Is­rael-Arab re­la­tions. But it holds a huge im­por­tance, and largely for psy­cho­log­i­cal rea­sons.</p>
    <p>Since the growth of the Jewish set­tle­ment in Pales­tine a cen­tury ago, and par­tic­u­larly since the es­tab­lish­ment of Is­rael in 1948, the Jewish state had re­mained stuck in the un­usual po­si­tion that not only was its very ex­is­tence de­nied by all its neigh­bours, but also that most of its cit­i­zens were re­garded as in­ter­lop­ers, for­eign­ers in their re­gion.</p>
    <p>So, gain­ing the recog­ni­tion of their neigh­bours was al­ways a key ob­jec­tive for all Is­raeli lead­ers, for it was largely seen as the ul­ti­mate proof that the Jewish state was there to stay.</p>
    <p>But this psy­cho­log­i­cal need apart, in prac­ti­cal terms Is­rael’s diplo­matic iso­la­tion mat­tered very lit­tle in the past and mat­ters even less now. When any­one in Is­rael talks about tak­ing a for­eign hol­i­day, the au­to­matic as­sump­tion is that this en­tails fly­ing long-dis­tance to an­other con­ti­nent; Is­raelis must be one of the few na­tion­als in the in­dus­tri­alised world who don’t even think of vis­it­ing their im­me­di­ate neigh­bours.</p>
    <p>Young Is­raelis fol­low mu­sic and fash­ion trends from Europe or the US but have lit­tle idea of or in­ter­est in sim­i­lar trends across their im­me­di­ate bor­ders which are of­ten not more than a few hun­dred kilo­me­tres away. And apart from the Pales­tini­ans, Arabs are equally supremely ig­no­rant about Is­rael. Eco­nomic links are non-ex­is­tent too.</p>
    <p>Fur­ther­more, even when diplo­matic re­la­tions were es­tab­lished be­tween Is­rael and some of its Arab neigh­bours, they never lived up to the ini­tial prom­ise. Egypt opened an em­bassy in Tel-Aviv in 1980, and Jor­dan fol­lowed suit in 1994. In both cases, there was a lot of ex­cited talk about friend­ship, tourism and trade – vi­sions of Egyp­tian busi­ness­men ex­pand­ing their ac­tiv­i­ties to Is­rael and hordes of Is­raeli tourists vis­it­ing the pyra­mids or Pe­tra, the stun­ning his­toric site in Jor­dan’s south-west­ern desert.</p>
    <p>But none of this hap­pened. For se­cu­rity rea­sons, few Is­raelis go to ei­ther Jor­dan or Egypt and, when they do so, they use se­condary pass­ports of other coun­tries, which many Is­raelis have ac­cess to, due to their an­ces­try. The prom­ise of en­hanced trade has also re­mained just that: a prom­ise.</p>
    <p>And in­stead of friend­ship, an­i­mos­ity in­creased. Just about the first thing that hap­pened in Egypt after the over­throw of pres­i­dent Hosni Mubarak as part of the so­called Arab Spring move­ment of 2011 was an at­tempt by crowds of Egyp­tians to storm the lo­cal Is­raeli em­bassy, and the reap­pear­ance of openly anti-Semitic ex­pres­sions in the Egyp­tian me­dia.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, one opin­ion poll after an­other in­di­cates that some of the strong­est anti-Is­raeli feel­ings are to be found among or­di­nary Jor­da­ni­ans.</p>
    <p>SE­CU­RITY CO­OP­ER­A­TION</p>
    <p>What has worked, how­ever, be­tween Is­rael and Egypt and Jor­dan is co­op­er­a­tion among in­tel­li­gence agen­cies. Is­rael’s spooks are help­ing Egypt iden­tify and elim­i­nate ter­ror­ist groups in the vast ex­panses of the Si­nai desert, and in the col­lec­tion of broader in­tel­li­gence in­for­ma­tion about de­vel­op­ments in the re­gion.</p>
    <p>Is­rael’s spies are also co­op­er­at­ing with the Jor­da­ni­ans in pre­vent­ing the smug­gling of weapons and fight­ers to the Is­raeli-oc­cu­pied West Bank, and Is­rael’s in­tel­li­gence ser­vices are also known to be on alert for the slight­est threat to the rule of the Jor­da­nian monarch.</p>
    <p>The same seems likely to hap­pen with Is­rael’s newly es­tab­lished re­la­tions with the UAE. Out of the Emi­rates’ nine-mil­lion-strong pop­u­la­tion, only about one mil­lion are ac­tual cit­i­zens; the rest are for­eign work­ers, many with only mod­est fi­nan­cial means.</p>
    <p>Wealthy and well looked after, some Emi­ratis may in­deed visit Is­rael out of cu­rios­ity, and some Is­raelis could do the same. But fives­tar ho­tels and beaches are what both coun­tries have in abun­dance, so it is doubt­ful that tourism or other con­tacts be­tween or­di­nary peo­ple from the two na­tions will ul­ti­mately be as ex­ten­sive as ex­cited diplo­mats are now sug­gest­ing.</p>
    <p>What is clear, how­ever, is that Is­raeli se­cu­rity com­pa­nies will rush to of­fer their ser­vices; many have done so al­ready over the years. And the Emi­rates’ vo­ra­cious ap­petite not only for buy­ing weapons but for the trans­fer of tech­nol­ogy to man­u­fac­ture these on the spot is likely to re­sult in a flour­ish­ing mil­i­tary trade. Is­raeli drone tech­nol­ogy is likely to be very prized.</p>
    <p>So, just as in the case of Egypt and Jor­dan, the re­la­tion­ship will set­tle down to one be­tween the mil­i­tary and se­cu­rity ser­vices, with most of the ac­tiv­ity hid­den from the pub­lic gaze.</p>
    <p>AC­CORD’S TRUE SIG­NIF­I­CANCE</p>
    <p>Still, the so-called Abra­ham Ac­cord is highly sig­nif­i­cant for the re­gion as a whole, al­beit for very dif­fer­ent rea­sons from those sug­gested by Pres­i­dent Trump and his son-in­law.</p>
    <p>The ac­cord rep­re­sents a vin­di­ca­tion of Is­raeli Prime Min­is­ter Ben­jamin Ne­tanyahu’s claim that Is­rael does not need to of­fer any con­ces­sions to reach a peace deal with the Pales­tini­ans which will al­low for the cre­ation of a Pales­tinian state. As Mr Ne­tanyahu can now plau­si­bly claim, his coun­try can forge re­la­tions with its neigh­bours while ig­nor­ing the Pales­tini­ans al­to­gether.</p>
    <p>The UAE deal is not only a per­sonal tri­umph for Mr Ne­tanyahu; it could also spell his po­lit­i­cal sal­va­tion, since the agree­ment with the Emi­ratis has given him a new lease of life, just as he is about to face the prospect of new elec­tions and a crim­i­nal court case for al­leged cor­rup­tion.</p>
    <p>The deal is also a clear in­di­ca­tion of how Mid­dle East­ern lead­ers are pre­par­ing for the pos­si­bil­ity that Mr Trump will no longer be in the White House after Jan­uary next year.</p>
    <p>Crown Prince Mo­ham­mad Bin Zayd, the real power in the UAE, could have clinched this deal more than a year ago. But he waited un­til this crit­i­cal junc­ture with the US pres­i­den­tial elec­tion due in less than three months pre­cisely be­cause he wanted it to be pre­sented as a deal suitable for ei­ther Pres­i­dent Trump should he be re­elected, or Se­na­tor Joe Bi­den should he win the US bal­lot in Novem­ber.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump, who bro­kered the deal, can claim a diplo­matic tri­umph. But Mr Bi­den can hardly repu­di­ate a deal which al­legedly re­duces ten­sions in the Mid­dle East and is pop­u­lar with pro-Is­rael elec­toral lob­bies in the US.</p>
    <p>Prince Mo­ham­mad has there­fore ma­noeu­vred him­self into a piv­otal po­si­tion re­gard­less of who wins power in Wash­ing­ton; even if Mr Bi­den gets into the White House and dis­tances him­self from coun­tries such as Saudi Ara­bia which have been vo­cal in their per­sonal sup­port for Pres­i­dent Trump, Mr Bi­den is likely to look favourably upon the UAE as one coun­try able to pro­vide use­ful links be­tween Is­rael and its Arab neigh­bours.</p>
    <p>But the most im­por­tant mes­sage from the Is­rael-UAE deal is how the Mid­dle East is chang­ing.</p>
    <p>A new gen­er­a­tion of Gulf Arabs has lit­tle in­ter­est in the Pales­tinian prob­lem, and lit­tle time for the old pol­i­tics of so­cial and na­tional Arab griev­ances; what it and its Gulf lead­ers fear most is Iran, and the brand of Shi’ite Is­lam it is seek­ing to ex­port.</p>
    <p>The Gulf Arab monar­chies also fear the in­sta­bil­ity which spews out of col­lapsed states which now sur­round them, from war-torn Iraq, Syria and Ye­men, to dys­func­tional Le­banon.</p>
    <p>It is pos­si­ble that Bahrain will join the Emi­ratis in es­tab­lish­ing re­la­tions with Is­rael; the Gulf king­dom has pub­licly wel­comed the UAE’s move. But it is un­likely that Saudi Ara­bia, by far the big­gest ac­tor in the Gulf, will fol­low suit.</p>
    <p>Still, the new axis de­signed to up­hold the re­gional sta­tus quo is emerg­ing. And it is likely to re­sult in re­duced Arab sol­i­dar­ity. It is no­tice­able, for in­stance, that the two pow­ers which crit­i­cised the UAE move most ve­he­mently are Iran and Tur­key, and nei­ther are Arab pow­ers.</p>
    <p>Be that as it may, it is also worth re­mem­ber­ing that none of this amounts to the true and per­ma­nent “nor­mal­i­sa­tion” of re­la­tions be­tween Is­rael and its Arab neigh­bours.</p>
    <p>For as long as Is­rael forges links with in­di­vid­ual Arab coun­tries without ad­dress­ing the roots of the an­i­mos­ity be­tween Arabs and Jews, which is the plight of the Pales­tini­ans, all the links which Is­rael es­tab­lishes re­main with in­di­vid­ual rulers and lead­ers in spe­cific Arab na­tions, rather than to these na­tions at large.</p>
    <p>The sources of the vi­o­lence and ten­sion there­fore re­main; only the key play­ers change roles and tac­tics.</p>
