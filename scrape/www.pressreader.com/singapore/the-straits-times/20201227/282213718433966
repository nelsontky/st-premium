    <p>MELVIN CHEW, 42 Owner of Jin Ji Teochew Braised Duck & Kway Chap at Chi­na­town Com­plex Food Cen­tre</p>
    <p>The straight-talk­ing, oc­ca­sion­ally foul-mouthed, sweat-towel-wear­ing Mr Melvin Chew be­came the voice for hawk­ers dur­ing the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>In April, the sec­ond-gen­er­a­tion hawker founded the Face­book group Hawk­ers United – Dabao 2020 as a plat­form to sup­port hawk­ers in the cir­cuit breaker. Shortly af­ter, he ral­lied to­gether an­other group – De­liv­ery United – to link hawk­ers and cus­tomers with food de­liv­ery driv­ers.</p>
    <p>To date, Hawk­ers United has en­listed more than 282,000 mem­bers, and De­liv­ery United, over 8,000 mem­bers.</p>
    <p>Two other Face­book groups, Sweets United, for those sell­ing desserts, and Pasar United – Dabao 2020, for sell­ing gro­ceries, are now run by other ad­min­is­tra­tors, af­ter an in­ter­nal con­flict in Oc­to­ber over the own­er­ship of Hawk­ers United.</p>
    <p>Two weeks ago, Mr Chew started Home Base Busi­ness United to sup­port the surge in those sell­ing food from home.</p>
    <p>He is now the poster boy for Sin­ga­pore hawk­ers in lo­cal and in­ter­na­tional me­dia. He was a mem­ber of the Work­group on Sus­tain­ing the Hawker Trade by the Na­tional En­vi­ron­ment Agency, and has also been ac­tively in­volved with var­i­ous govern­ment agen­cies, bring­ing up prob­lems hawk­ers face with dig­i­tal­i­sa­tion.</p>
    <p>One of the is­sues he has raised is the lack of un­der­stand­ing of what new tech­nol­ogy means for hawker busi­nesses.</p>
    <p>In June, it was an­nounced that hawk­ers who sign up for the uni­fied Sin­ga­pore Quick Re­sponse Code un­der the Hawk­ers Go Dig­i­tal ini­tia­tive are el­i­gi­ble for a bonus of $300 a month over any five months next year if they have at least 20 cash­less trans­ac­tions a month.</p>
    <p>Mr Chew has likened these in­cen­tives to “giv­ing candy to chil­dren”.</p>
    <p>“It may help with pro­mot­ing cash­less pay­ment, but, re­al­is­ti­cally, a move like this does not nec­es­sar­ily help us earn more money,” he adds.</p>
    <p>In­stead, he has pro­posed dig­i­tal bank­ing plat­forms that of­fer longer-term re­bates to hawk­ers who use them.</p>
    <p>At his fam­ily’s 37-year-old stall in Chi­na­town, which he runs with his 63-year-old mother and two sib­lings, he has rolled out dif­fer­ent means of pay­ment – GrabPay, Ali­pay and FavePay – to walk the dig­i­tal talk him­self. He is also ac­tive on var­i­ous de­liv­ery plat­forms, such as WhyQ, GrabFood, food­panda and De­liv­eroo.</p>
    <p>He says of­fer­ing is­land­wide de­liv­ery on Od­dle has helped shore up his bot­tom line. Re­sponse has also been good for his weekend whole­duck de­liv­ery pro­mo­tion to dif­fer­ent parts of Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>On Face­book, he of­fers a on­estop so­lu­tion for those look­ing to buy food from dif­fer­ent stalls in Chi­na­town Com­plex Food Cen­tre. This ini­tia­tive is mainly to help the drinks and desserts stalls, as “no one is go­ing to pay de­liv­ery fees to dabao one drink”, he says.</p>
    <p>Call him a fu­tur­is­tic hawker con­sul­tant or men­tor, as some have, and he de­murs with a chuckle: “No lah, I’m just kay­poh.</p>
    <p>“If you want the truth, you come to me. If you want ev­ery­thing to sound nice, go some­where else. If I have is­sues, I will bring it up.”</p>
    <p>Much con­tro­versy swirls about him in the hawker com­mu­nity. Some see him as an op­por­tunist, oth­ers as a brash loud­mouth. But he is quick to de­fend his fel­low hawk­ers, es­pe­cially when ne­ti­zens at­tack them on Face­book groups.</p>
    <p>“They are just ask­ing for sup­port, so there’s no need to con­demn them and say that the food is not nice or ex­pen­sive.</p>
    <p>“When the char kway teow hawker cooks 300 plates in seven hours, 10 plates may be a bit ‘off’ be­cause he’s tired. Even a robot will break down af­ter work­ing for too long. Put your­self in his shoes, can you reach the same standard?”</p>
    <p>With the suc­cess­ful in­clu­sion of Sin­ga­pore’s hawker cul­ture in Unesco’s in­tan­gi­ble cul­tural her­itage list, he hopes the re­cent spot­light on hawk­ers will not just be a flash in the pan, but also even­tu­ally raise their stature here and over­seas.</p>
    <p>He looks for­ward to the day that lo­cal hawker fare will be sold and cel­e­brated over­seas. Thai­land’s tom yam soup, for ex­am­ple, has at­tained the global recog­ni­tion that lo­cal dishes should strive for, he says.</p>
    <p>“In the fu­ture, if there’s no Sin­ga­pore food – no char kway teow, bak chor mee or hand­made fish­balls – we’re dead. Our hawker her­itage will just be­come his­tory, and we don’t want this to hap­pen. Now, when we see some­one cooking with char­coal, we go, ‘Wow’.</p>
    <p>“Af­ter all, tourists come here for our food. We have to credit our first-gen­er­a­tion hawk­ers for this. We wouldn’t be here with­out them. We need their ex­pe­ri­ence and they need us to carry on the her­itage.”</p>
