    <p>Where: 01-15 Hougang Green Shopping Mall, 21 Hougang Street 51; open: 9am to 9pm daily</p>

    <p>The four-month-old Asia Mart is the first re­tail con­cept spin-off from Home Town – a gro­cery im­porter and trader in Sin­ga­pore for more than 30 years.</p>
    <p>Through the cir­cuit breaker pe­riod, its manag­ing di­rec­tor Ja­son</p>
    <p>Yong ob­served the growth of the busi­ness-to-con­sumer seg­ment, and a bud­ding interest in food prod­ucts from South-east Asia.</p>
    <p>The small shop in Hougang crams in rows of in­stant noo­dles, sauces and snacks from coun­tries such as Thai­land, Viet­nam, Myan­mar and the Philip­pines.</p>
    <p>Look out for hot items such as Color Man in­stant cof­fee from Viet­nam ($8.50); ThaSiam in­stant boat noo­dles (from $13.90) and gluten­free sauces (from $4) by Healthy Boy from Thai­land.</p>
    <p>Work­ing with part­ners in the re­gion, Mr Yong tries to im­port new prod­ucts as soon as they are launched over­seas.</p>
    <p>He says: “Many South-east Asians who have been in Sin­ga­pore for many years miss food from their home coun­tries. Asia Mart was set up to cater to them, and for Sin­ga­pore­ans who can­not travel at the mo­ment.”</p>
