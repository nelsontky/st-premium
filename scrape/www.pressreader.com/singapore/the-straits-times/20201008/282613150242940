    <p>Chanel went back to the time­less glam­our of black-and­white Hol­ly­wood movies while Louis Vuit­ton em­braced a gen­derneu­tral fu­ture on Tues­day, the last day of Paris Fash­ion Week.</p>
    <p>Top supermodel­s walked un­der a huge Hol­ly­wood-style sign spell­ing out Chanel’s name in its big­gest cat­walk spec­ta­cle since de­signer Vir­ginie Viard took over the French house from Karl Lager­feld af­ter his death last year.</p>
    <p>Covid-19 re­stric­tions may have lim­ited the num­ber of fash­ion­istas al­lowed into the Grand Palais in cen­tral Paris, but like the decor, Viard wrote her am­bi­tions large.</p>
    <p>Her col­lec­tion was no less than a grand sweep through the l ong his­tory of the la­bel founded by Gabrielle “Coco” Chanel, with a gi­ant nod to the lat­ter’s time in Tin­sel­town in the 1930s, when she dressed stars like Greta Garbo, Katharine Hep­burn and Glo­ria Swan­son. “I was think­ing of ac­tresses on the red car­pet... some of whom we haven’t seen in a long time... their faces a lit­tle some­where else as the pho­tog­ra­phers call out to them,” Viard said.</p>
    <p>The show co­in­cides with the first mu­seum ex­hi­bi­tion ded­i­cated to Coco Chanel in the French cap­i­tal, which opened last week. Viard re­cre­ated and up­dated some of Coco’s most beloved looks, with a nod to Lager­feld’s more street fash­ion sen­si­bil­ity with lo­gos a go-go.</p>
    <p>“Gabrielle Chanel and Karl Lager­feld dressed so many ac­tresses in their films and in their lives. They made us dream. With­out re­do­ing clothes ex­actly and fall­ing into vin­tage, I wanted it to be very joy­ous and colour­ful and full of life.”</p>
    <p>With Paris Fash­ion Week forced largely on­line by the pan­demic, Chanel live-streamed the show for fans. “Lights, cam­eras, ac­tion!” it de­clared on In­sta­gram as it aped the open­ing of a silent black-and-white film, plac­ing a huge Chanel sign on the Hol­ly­wood Hills. Viard kept up the theme of the brand’s long as­so­ci­a­tion with the silver screen with video clips of mod­els re­clin­ing in lux­ury ho­tels like movie idols about to at­tend pre­mieres.</p>
    <p>While Chanel looked back, Ni­co­las Gh­esquiere’s Louis Vuit­ton could not be more res­o­lutely now – with the open­ing look a sweater em­bla­zoned with “Vote”, a ral­ly­ing call for the lib­eral left in the up­com­ing United States pres­i­den­tial elec­tion.</p>
    <p>But that was as con­ven­tion­ally po­lit­i­cal as it got, with the French de­signer in­sist­ing his eyes were set firmly on the pos­si­bil­i­ties that gen­der-fluid clothes might of­fer in the fu­ture.</p>
    <p>“What cut might dis­solve the mas­cu­line and the fem­i­nine?” he asked. “What wardrobe might make them come to­gether in one?” He said he wanted to bring the world’s rich­est lux­ury la­bel on a “voy­age of ex­plo­ration... to dis­cover and abol­ish the last (gen­der) fron­tiers”.</p>
    <p>The bravura show was held in the long-closed La Sa­mar­i­taine de­part­ment store, which is due to re­open next year. As al­ways with Gh­esquiere, it was all in the cut, with clas­sic business and streetwear uni­forms given sur­pris­ing turns. But per­haps the most eye­catch­ing thing about his Spring/ Sum­mer 2021 col­lec­tion were the shoes, with a line of pointed clog stilet­tos send­ing In­sta­gram into spasms.</p>
