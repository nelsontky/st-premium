    <p>The In­dian gov­ern­ment has banned more Chi­nese mo­bile ap­pli­ca­tions this week.</p>
    <p>An ini­tial ban of 59 apps in June came in re­sponse to bor­der clashes be­tween the two coun­tries in May that re­sulted in the deaths of 20 In­dian sol­diers.</p>
    <p>The Min­istry of Elec­tron­ics and In­for­ma­tion Tech­nol­ogy said af­ter the ini­tial app ban on June 29 that the Chi­nese tech com­pa­nies might be “steal­ing and sur­rep­ti­tiously trans­mit­ting users’ data in an unau­tho­rised man­ner to servers which have lo­ca­tions out­side In­dia”.</p>
    <p>Chi­nese For­eign Min­istry spokesman Zhao Li­jian had said that China was “strongly con­cerned” about the In­dian no­tice.</p>
    <p>On Tues­day, the In­dian gov­ern­ment banned more Chi­nese apps, but did not dis­close the names.</p>
    <p>The first set of apps to be blocked in­cluded ByteDance-owned videoshar­ing app TikTok, Alibabaown­ed UC Browser, Ten­cent’s WeChat, file-shar­ing app SHAREit, beauty app Meitu, on­line shop­ping app Shein and two apps of mo­bile phone maker Xiaomi.</p>
    <p>The newly banned apps ap­pear to be clones or light ver­sions of the al­ready banned apps, like TikTok Lite, Helo Lite, SHAREit Lite and BIGO LIVE Lite.</p>
    <p>These apps are not avail­able for down­load on Google Play and Ap­ple’s App Store in In­dia any more. Users are also un­able to ac­cess Mi Browser, which comes pre-in­stalled in Xiaomi mo­bile phones.</p>
    <p>The spokesman for the Chi­nese Em­bassy in In­dia, Coun­sel­lor Ji Rong, crit­i­cised this week’s ban, say­ing: “The In­dian gov­ern­ment has the re­spon­si­bil­ity to pro­tect the le­git­i­mate rights and in­ter­ests of in­ter­na­tional in­vestors in In­dia, in­clud­ing Chi­nese busi­nesses, in ac­cor­dance with mar­ket prin­ci­ples. Prac­ti­cal co­op­er­a­tion be­tween China and In­dia is mu­tu­ally ben­e­fi­cial. De­lib­er­ate in­ter­fer­ence in such co­op­er­a­tion will not serve the in­ter­ests of the In­dian side.”</p>
    <p>Mean­while, com­pa­nies that faced bans ear­lier are hav­ing to re­spond to an In­dian gov­ern­ment in­ves­ti­ga­tion about their op­er­a­tions in In­dia.</p>
    <p>In mid-July, In­dia’s IT Min­istry sent the com­pa­nies a list of 77 ques­tions, re­ported Reuters and The Times of In­dia.</p>
    <p>A TikTok spokesman told The Straits Times that the com­pany had sub­mit­ted its re­sponse to the gov­ern­ment and that “through­out the du­ra­tion of our op­er­a­tions, we have demon­strated un­equiv­o­cal com­mit­ment to com­ply­ing with the lo­cal laws, in­clud­ing data pri­vacy and se­cu­rity re­quire­ments”.</p>
    <p>TikTok is the most pop­u­lar of the banned apps, with about 200 mil­lion users in the coun­try. In­dia is its largest for­eign mar­ket, ac­count­ing for 30 per cent of global down­loads.</p>
    <p>Xiaomi In­dia, Meitu and Alibaba did not re­spond to ST’s queries about the num­ber or na­ture of the ques­tions asked.</p>
    <p>In­dia’s IT Min­istry also did not com­ment.</p>
    <p>A Reuters re­port based on min­istry sources said some of the queries in the ques­tion­naire were about whether the Chi­nese apps cen­sored any con­tent re­lated to the mil­i­tant at­tack in the Pul­wama district of Kash­mir in Fe­bru­ary last year, in which 40 se­cu­rity force per­son­nel died.</p>
    <p>The com­pa­nies have also been asked if they work on be­half of for­eign gov­ern­ments, re­ceive Chi­nese gov­ern­ment sub­si­dies or have lob­bied celebri­ties and influencer­s in In­dia, as well as whether they faced any in­ves­ti­ga­tion in the United States, Euro­pean Union or else­where for sur­rep­ti­tiously har­vest­ing user data.</p>
    <p>The Chi­nese com­pa­nies were given three weeks to re­spond.</p>
    <p>The lo­cal tech in­dus­try is now see­ing a surge in home­made apps, as Indians look for al­ter­na­tives to the banned ones.</p>
    <p>Kaagaz Scan­ner and Bharat Scan­ner, for in­stance, have emerged to re­place the banned CamS­can­ner, a photo scan­ning app. Short video apps like Mitron TV and Chin­gari are try­ing to cap­ture the huge mar­ket TikTok cre­ated.</p>
    <p>Com­ments in the re­view sec­tion praise the apps as “best to de­feat TikTok” but sug­gest bet­ter an­i­ma­tions, search but­tons and fea­tures that are lighter on data us­age.</p>
    <p>Many apps on Google Play now fea­ture sub­heads like “Made in In­dia” or “In­dia’s own”.</p>
    <p>Pa­per Scan­ner, a lo­cal app launched in mid-June, even in­cor­po­rates a lit­tle In­dian flag in its logo.</p>
