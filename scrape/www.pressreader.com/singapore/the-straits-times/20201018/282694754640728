    <p>EPERNAY (France) • Will a sec­ond wave of coro­n­avirus in­fec­tions burst the bub­ble of French cham­pagne pro­duc­ers hop­ing to ring in next year with some good cheer af­ter heavy Covid-re­lated losses?</p>
    <p>The pan­demic has put a damper on fizz con­sump­tion this year, with re­tail sales in France fall­ing 23 per cent be­tween Jan­uary and July as restau­rants closed and mil­lions of peo­ple went into lock­down.</p>
    <p>For the full year, the global de­cline in sales is ex­pected to reach up to 30 per cent, “a colos­sal eco­nomic shock un­seen since World War II”, ac­cord­ing to the SGV cham­pagne grow­ers union.</p>
    <p>Pro­duc­ers of the fes­tive tip­ple in the cham­pagne cap­i­tal of Epernay, in north-east France, are hop­ing that the global mood will have light­ened by New Year’s Eve and that peo­ple will be pop­ping corks again.</p>
    <p>But with the virus tip­ping the global econ­omy into a slump and forc­ing rev­ellers to call off large gath­er­ings, in­clud­ing big wed­dings, there has been lit­tle cause for cel­e­bra­tion.</p>
    <p>In France, where bars in Paris and sev­eral other cities were closed two weeks ago, Pres­i­dent Em­manuel Macron last Wed­nes­day or­dered a night-time cur­few for Paris and eight other French cities to con­tain the spread of Covid-19 af­ter daily new in­fec­tion rates reached alarm­ing record lev­els.</p>
    <p>Faced with the steady drip of bad news, the cham­pagne in­dus­try has been try­ing to re­cast the wine’s elite im­age and por­tray it as more than suit­able for ev­ery­day drink­ing.</p>
    <p>A re­cent ad showed a glass of bub­bly be­ing set down next to a slice of toast topped with sar­dines.</p>
    <p>“There’s noth­ing to cel­e­brate, just some­thing to savour,” was the catch­line.</p>
    <p>NO FRENCH BUF­FER</p>
    <p>Cham­pagne sales have tra­di­tion­ally acted as a barom­e­ter of global con­fi­dence, tank­ing dur­ing wars, eco­nomic crises and health scares.</p>
    <p>At the height of the first wave of coro­n­avirus out­breaks last spring, sales in Europe plunged 65 per cent.</p>
    <p>Top brands, like Mumm and Veuve Clic­quot, were par­tic­u­larly hurt by the slow­down in air travel, which all but dried up all-im­por­tant duty-free sales.</p>
    <p>The Union des Maisons de Cham­pagne trade body has said it ex­pects to sell 100 mil­lion fewer bot­tles this year, an un­heard-of hit that will slash over­all sales to €3.3 bil­lion (S$5.3 bil­lion) – down 34 per cent from last year.</p>
    <p>The SGV union has ex­pressed “strong con­cern” for ex­ports to the United States and Bri­tain, the two big­gest mar­kets for cham­pagne out­side France.</p>
    <p>Mr An­toine Chi­quet, head of the Gas­ton Chi­quet cham­pagne house in the vil­lage of Dizy, near Epernay, is con­fi­dent the bub­bles will flow again be­fore this year is out.</p>
    <p>But will it be a trickle or a flood? “For the French, there’s no doubt. Cham­pagne is the drink of choice for year-end fes­tiv­i­ties,” he said.</p>
    <p>“It’s the same for our Bri­tish and Ital­ian friends, but the ques­tion is, in what quan­ti­ties?”</p>
    <p>BAT­TLE OVER YIELDS</p>
    <p>There was some re­lief this sum­mer for smaller cham­pagne houses as Euro­peans be­gan to travel across the con­ti­nent again, giv­ing wine tourism in the Cham­pagne re­gion a shot in the arm.</p>
    <p>The Boizel cham­pagne house in Epernay said it re­ceived “sur­pris­ingly large” num­bers of Bel­gian, Scan­di­na­vian and Bri­tish vis­i­tors.</p>
    <p>But with gov­ern­ments around the world im­pos­ing new lock­downs to slow the spread of Covid-19, the mar­ket looks set to freeze over once more.</p>
    <p>The virus has sad­dled pro­duc­ers with more than 1.2 bil­lion bot­tles in stock, rep­re­sent­ing sev­eral years of po­ten­tial sales.</p>
    <p>While the sur­plus can be used by pro­duc­ers as col­lat­eral for a bank loan, ex­cess sup­ply also drives down prices.</p>
    <p>To avoid see­ing prices go through the floor, traders rep­re­sent­ing the big cham­pagne houses drove a hard bar­gain this year with the thou­sands of grow­ers who sup­ply their grapes.</p>
    <p>The cham­pagne houses de­manded a sharp re­duc­tion in out­put, in­fu­ri­at­ing grow­ers who were cel­e­brat­ing an ex­cep­tional har­vest.</p>
    <p>In the end the two sides agreed on 8,000kg of grapes per hectare – the equiv­a­lent of 230 mil­lion bot­tles.</p>
    <p>Be­sides shoring up prices, sev­eral cham­pagne pro­duc­ers have also de­cided, some­what be­lat­edly, to go green.</p>
    <p>Mar­ket leader Moet Hen­nessy, which in­cludes the Ruinart, Dom Perignon and Moet et Chan­don brands, an­nounced this year that it would halt the use of chem­i­cal weed­killers in its vine­yards by the end of this year.</p>
