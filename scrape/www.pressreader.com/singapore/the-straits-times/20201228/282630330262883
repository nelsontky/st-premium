    <p>Re­search can some­times con­firm what par­ents al­ready sense: Sim­ple learn­ing ac­tiv­i­ties with chil­dren at home can be a gamechange­r.</p>
    <p>The first kinder­garten lon­gi­tu­di­nal study here showed that fam­ily in­come and the par­ents’ ed­u­ca­tion level can im­pact the learn­ing and devel­op­ment of chil­dren. The study fol­lowed 1,537 chil­dren from 80 pre-schools from Kinder­garten 1 to Pri­mary 1 .</p>
    <p>One im­por­tant find­ing from the study is that re­gard­less of the par­ents’ in­come and ed­u­ca­tional lev­els, learn­ing ac­tiv­i­ties at home can have a ma­jor in­flu­ence on de­vel­op­ing the math­e­mat­i­cal and lan­guage skills of young chil­dren.</p>
    <p>The Sin­ga­pore Kinder­garten Im­pact Project (Skip) tracked the chil­dren from 2015 when they en­tered kinder­garten, till July 2017, seven months af­ter they en­rolled in Pri­mary 1.</p>
    <p>Na­tional In­sti­tute of Ed­u­ca­tion re­search sci­en­tist Ng Ee Lynn, who led the study, said par­ents of­fer­ing learn­ing ac­tiv­i­ties at home mat­ters not only in math­e­mat­ics, English and mother tongue ac­qui­si­tion, but also in de­vel­op­ing ex­ec­u­tive func­tion­ing skills like the abil­ity to fo­cus.</p>
    <p>She said: “De­spite their ed­u­ca­tion or in­come level, if they pro­vide op­por­tu­ni­ties for chil­dren to learn, be it count­ing games or sing­ing rhyming songs, it helps to build a child’s lit­er­acy and nu­mer­acy skills.”</p>
    <p>The study also found that read­ing books in the mother tongue (MT) lan­guage at home con­trib­utes to chil­dren’s vo­cab­u­lary in the lan­guage at K1.</p>
    <p>The team found that while chil­dren from lower-in­come fam­i­lies may en­ter K1 with lower ex­ec­u­tive func­tion­ing skills – as well as lower lit­er­acy and nu­mer­acy skills – they went on to im­prove th­ese skills at the same rate as their peers from K1 to Pri­mary 1.</p>
    <p>Dr Ng said that the ac­tiv­i­ties that par­ents pro­vide at home can be sim­ple ones.</p>
    <p>To de­velop lan­guage skills, for ex­am­ple, par­ents can read a bed­time story every night, tell sto­ries or sing rhyming songs with their chil­dren.</p>
    <p>To de­velop nu­mer­acy skills, par­ents can get their chil­dren to play count­ing games, do sim­ple adding or sub­trac­tion, or tell the time us­ing clocks or cal­en­dars.</p>
    <p>“Th­ese are sim­ple, en­joy­able ac­tiv­i­ties and don’t re­quire too much or­gan­i­sa­tion or resources,” she said.</p>
    <p>Re­searchers who study nu­mer­acy devel­op­ment ad­vise par­ents to of­fer both di­rect and in­di­rect nu­mer­acy ac­tiv­i­ties.</p>
    <p>Di­rect nu­mer­acy ac­tiv­i­ties in­clude spe­cific num­ber tasks that par­ents en­gage in with their chil­dren so as to teach quan­ti­ta­tive skills such as count­ing.</p>
    <p>In­di­rect nu­mer­acy ac­tiv­i­ties in­clude real-world tasks that par­ents en­gage in with their chil­dren that likely have an in­ci­den­tal re­la­tion to quan­ti­ta­tive skill devel­op­ment, such as cook­ing or play­ing cards.</p>
    <p>Dr Ng stressed the im­por­tance of de­vel­op­ing ex­ec­u­tive func­tion­ing and self-reg­u­la­tion skills, which are cru­cial for learn­ing and devel­op­ment. They are men­tal pro­cesses that en­able chil­dren to plan, fo­cus at­ten­tion, re­mem­ber in­struc­tions and jug­gle mul­ti­ple tasks.</p>
    <p>Ex­perts sug­gest that again, par­ents can play sim­ple games to build th­ese skills, such as get­ting their child to im­i­tate them.</p>
    <p>When chil­dren im­i­tate, they have to keep track of the ac­tions, re­mem­ber them, wait for their turn and re­call what was done. In do­ing so, they prac­tise at­ten­tion, work­ing mem­ory and self-con­trol.</p>
    <p>Dr Ng said talk­ing with an in­fant is a won­der­ful way to build lan­guage, at­ten­tion, work­ing mem­ory and self-con­trol.</p>
    <p>Many stud­ies, in­clud­ing some by Har­vard Univer­sity and the Mas­sachusetts In­sti­tute of Tech­nol­ogy (MIT), have found that one of the best things par­ents can do for their chil­dren is to have fre­quent backand-forth ex­changes with them.</p>
    <p>In the MIT study, re­searchers eval­u­ated chil­dren us­ing func­tional mag­netic res­o­nance imag­ing to iden­tify the dif­fer­ences in how the brain re­sponds to dif­fer­ent con­ver­sa­tional styles.</p>
    <p>They found that the Broca’s area, a re­gion of the brain that fo­cuses on speech pro­duc­tion and lan­guage pro­cess­ing, was much more ac­tive in chil­dren who en­gaged in back-and-forth con­ver­sa­tions.</p>
    <p>Re­search into de­vel­op­ing bilin­gual­ism has found that con­ver­sa­tions in any lan­guage be­sides English are also help­ful. It has also been found that bilin­gual chil­dren of many ages have bet­ter ex­ec­u­tive func­tion­ing skills than mono­lin­gual chil­dren.</p>
