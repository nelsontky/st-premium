    <p>PARIS • Tens of millions of pupils have re­turned to school in France, Poland and Rus­sia, their ruck­sacks loaded with ex­er­cise books, ge­om­e­try sets and, for many, face masks to pro­tect them from a resur­gent coro­n­avirus pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Hand cleans­ing sta­tions, so­cial dis­tanc­ing and stag­gered play time are the new nor­mal as coun­tries across Europe seek ways to get chil­dren back i nto the class­room safely, and their economies func­tion­ing once again.</p>
    <p>But they do so at a time when in­fec­tions rates are spi­ralling up­wards across the con­ti­nent and there are wide­spread con­cerns that the re­turn to schools and of­fices, the au­tumn flu sea­son and ex­cess mor­tal­ity in win­ter could drive a se­cond wave.</p>
    <p>In France, Spain and elsewhere, some par­ents and teach­ers’ unions have voiced con­cern at plans for re­open­ing class­rooms as the spread of the virus gath­ers re­newed pace.</p>
    <p>“It’s good they’re start­ing back, get­ting back to a nor­mal rou­tine,” said one par­ent, Stephanie, drop­ping off her daugh­ter yes­ter­day at her ju­nior high school in Saint-Leud’Es­ser­ent, north of Paris.</p>
    <p>Asked if she was wor­ried about the virus spread­ing in schools, she said: “Not any more than at the mar­ket. You can’t stop liv­ing, you just have to fol­low the rules.”</p>
    <p>Coun­tries are adopt­ing dif­fer­ent meth­ods to min­imise con­ta­gion in schools. Spain’s 17 re­gions are re­spon</p>
    <p>Global data on the spread of the coro­n­avirus pan­demic shows that chil­dren and young peo­ple make up only 1 per cent to 2 per cent of virus cases world­wide. Most re­ported in­fec­tions in chil­dren are mild or asymp­to­matic, with few recorded deaths.</p>
    <p>sible for their own back-to-school plan, though they must fol­low na­tional rules such as manda­tory masks for chil­dren over six.</p>
    <p>At a Catholic school in Ronda, south­ern Spain, staff were spac­ing out desks and setting up a one-way sys­tem through cor­ri­dors ahead of re­open­ing on Sept 10.</p>
    <p>“We’ve put in gel, we can take their tem­per­a­ture, we’ve got spac­ing in all the class­rooms,” said the school’s di­rec­tor, Mother Marta, dressed in a starched white habit and match­ing white mask.</p>
    <p>The French govern­ment has said the cri­sis must not put cit­i­zens’ lives on hold, while Bri­tish Prime Min­is­ter Boris John­son said it was cru­cial schools in Eng­land re­open this week. Scot­land’s schools re­opened last month, with masks manda­tory for sec­ondary school stu­dents ex­cept in class­rooms.</p>
    <p>At the height of coro­n­avirus lock­downs glob­ally in April, some 1.5 bil­lion chil­dren were hit by school clo­sures, ac­cord­ing to Un­esco. School clo­sures widened the in­equal­ity gap, ex­perts have said.</p>
    <p>The risk of coro­n­avirus trans­mis­sion within schools de­pends on what is hap­pen­ing in the lo­cal com­mu­nity as well as the safety mea­sures put in place, ac­cord­ing to epi­demi­ol­o­gists.</p>
    <p>Global data on the spread of the coro­n­avirus pan­demic shows that chil­dren and young peo­ple make up only 1 per cent to 2 per cent of virus cases world­wide. Most re­ported in­fec­tions in chil­dren are mild or asymp­to­matic, with few recorded deaths.</p>
    <p>“Schools op­er­ate in com­mu­ni­ties, they don’t op­er­ate in iso­la­tion. So the big thing that we look for is what does trans­mis­sion look like in the com­mu­nity where those schools op­er­ate,” World Health Or­gan­i­sa­tion epi­demi­ol­o­gist Maria Van Kerkhove said in Geneva.</p>
    <p>Ger­many and Swe­den may of­fer some re­as­sur­ance.</p>
    <p>In Ger­many, where schools have been re­open­ing since early last month, the pro­por­tion of coro­n­avirus cases among un­der-20s has re­mained sta­ble.</p>
    <p>In Swe­den, keep­ing schools open through­out the pan­demic did not lead to higher in­fec­tion rates among stu­dents com­pared with neigh­bour­ing Fin­land, where schools were closed tem­po­rar­ily.</p>
