    <p>Frac­tures showed be­tween Malaysia’s rul­ing coali­tion part­ners Umno and Parti Is­lam SeMalaysia (PAS) yes­ter­day, over dif­fer­ences in their stance on back­ing Prime Min­is­ter Muhyid­din Yassin’s ad­min­is­tra­tion.</p>
    <p>With Tan Sri Muhyid­din fac­ing fresh questions over his Par­lia­ment ma­jor­ity, Is­lamist party PAS has urged all the par­ties in his Perikatan Na­sional (PN) pact to re­it­er­ate their sup­port for the rul­ing coali­tion, which is look­ing in­creas­ingly vul­ner­a­ble.</p>
    <p>PAS sec­re­tary-gen­eral Takiyud­din Has­san said yes­ter­day that the par­ties should make a fresh rep­re­sen­ta­tion to Malaysia’s King, Sul­tan Ab­dul­lah Ah­mad Shah, reit­er­at­ing their com­mit­ment to the gov­ern­ment.</p>
    <p>“PAS urges par­ties en­trusted with form­ing His Majesty’s gov­ern­ment led by Tan Sri Muhyid­din Yassin as prime min­is­ter to of­fer un­di­vided sup­port with­out any in­ter­fer­ence to en­able proper and ef­fec­tive func­tion­ing of the gov­ern­ment,” Datuk Takiyud­din said in a state­ment.</p>
    <p>How­ever, Johor Umno deputy chief Nur Ja­zlan Mo­hamed said PAS should opt be­tween back­ing PN and be­ing with Muafakat Na­sional – the al­liance be­tween Umno and PAS. His state­ment came less than 48 hours after Umno, the big­gest party in PN, threat­ened to pull out of the coali­tion if a se­ries of fresh, un­spec­i­fied de­mands made by the party were not met.</p>
    <p>Sev­eral Umno lead­ers fur­ther un­der­mined Mr Muhyid­din’s ad­min­is­tra­tion when a let­ter sur­faced on Wed­nes­day from the party’s most se­nior MP, Tengku Raza­leigh</p>
    <p>Tengku Hamzah, urg­ing that a no­con­fi­dence mo­tion against Mr Muhyid­din be al­lowed to be pre­sented in Par­lia­ment.</p>
    <p>Umno supreme coun­cil mem­ber Ta­jud­din Ab­dul Rah­man also said Malaysians should “not be sur­prised” if the party de­cided to sup­port op­po­si­tion leader An­war Ibrahim in his bid to be premier.</p>
    <p>The lat­est se­ries of un­cer­tain­ties in the Malaysian po­lit­i­cal land­scape started on Tues­day, with Datuk Seri An­war seek­ing an au­di­ence with Sul­tan Ab­dul­lah as the vet­eran politi­cian claimed to have the par­lia­men­tary ma­jor­ity to form the next fed­eral gov­ern­ment.</p>
    <p>But his chal­lenge for the lead­er­ship did not im­me­di­ately suc­ceed, with the palace au­thor­i­ties later say­ing he did not pro­vide a list of the MPs who backed him.</p>
    <p>This was fol­lowed by Umno’s threat to leave PN. Mr Muhyid­din’s gov­ern­ment, which has only a twoseat ma­jor­ity in the Lower House, would ef­fec­tively col­lapse should Umno with­draw its sup­port. The party pre­vi­ously re­fused to join Mr Muhyid­din’s Parti Pribumi Ber­satu Malaysia and PAS in reg­is­ter­ing PN as a for­mal coali­tion.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, Mr An­war has been sum­moned by the Malaysian po­lice to pro­vide a state­ment to­day after a list of MPs who pur­port­edly sup­ported his premier­ship bid sur­faced on­line.</p>
    <p>Umno MPs whose names were al­legedly on the list had lodged po­lice re­ports.</p>
    <p>The po­lice con­firmed yes­ter­day they are in­ves­ti­gat­ing the mat­ter.</p>
    <p>To date, Mr An­war, the MP for Port Dick­son and pres­i­dent of Parti Kead­i­lan Rakyat, has not di­vulged the list of names of those back­ing his premier­ship bid.</p>
    <p>In a press con­fer­ence on Tues­day, Mr An­war merely said the num­ber of MPs back­ing him ex­ceeded 120.</p>
    <p>Mr Muhyid­din’s ad­min­is­tra­tion has a ra­zor-thin ma­jor­ity of 113 MPs in the 222-seat Lower House.</p>
