    <p>The Covid-19 cri­sis has ac­cel­er­ated dig­i­tal­i­sa­tion across the globe and in­creased the value of in­for­ma­tion and com­mu­ni­ca­tion skills.</p>
    <p>Demand for work­ers with th­ese skills was al­ready at an all-time high even be­fore the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>So I un­der­stand why Mr Peter Wade­ley wants com­puter science to be a com­pul­sory sub­ject at his son’s school (Make com­puter science com­pul­sory for sec­ondary schools, Aug 26).</p>
    <p>But as we pre­pare our chil­dren to cap­ture the ben­e­fits of the in­fo­comm rev­o­lu­tion, we should also ask if the sought-af­ter skills of today will be in demand to­mor­row.</p>
    <p>For ex­am­ple, cod­ing could be­come ob­so­lete as quickly as it be­came main­stream.</p>
    <p>Just over a decade ago, only skilled soft­ware de­vel­op­ers were able to build web­sites.</p>
    <p>Today, any­one with ac­cess to the In­ter­net can eas­ily cre­ate one us­ing tem­plates.</p>
    <p>Ar­ti­fi­cial in­tel­li­gence will con­tinue to ad­vance and au­to­mate many, if not most, pro­gram­ming func­tions.</p>
    <p>Even­tu­ally, com­plex com­put­ing chal­lenges may be solved by crit­i­cal-think­ing cre­atives who can imag­ine and ar­tic­u­late new so­lu­tions with­out any cod­ing.</p>
    <p>Even if this pro­jec­tion does not turn out to be en­tirely ac­cu­rate, we should at least won­der if bet­ting big on the buzz­word skills of today will be ben­e­fi­cial to­mor­row.</p>
    <p>We also have to avoid un­der­in­vest­ing in ar­eas that will serve our chil­dren well be­yond the short cy­cle of tech­nol­ogy skills.</p>
    <p>Per­son­ally, I would en­cour­age my daugh­ter to pos­sess th­ese five Cs: cre­ativ­ity, crit­i­cal think­ing, cul­tural aware­ness, col­lab­o­ra­tion and com­mu­ni­ca­tion skills.</p>
    <p>Such traits are likely to re­main rel­e­vant for the rest of the 21st cen­tury re­gard­less of the in­evitable ad­vances in tech­nol­ogy.</p>
    <p>Un­der­pin­ning th­ese five Cs is an­other C: cu­rios­ity. It is a cru­cial qual­ity to help our young peo­ple con­tin­u­ally learn and live their best lives.</p>
    <p>De­spite re­cent changes to our ed­u­ca­tion sys­tem, Mr Wade­ley’s view that it is de­ter­min­is­tic and com­part­men­talised is shared by many.</p>
    <p>In­deed, an overly tech­no­cratic ap­proach to ed­u­ca­tion has limited space for dis­cov­ery and de­lib­er­a­tion that is nec­es­sary to cul­ti­vate cu­rios­ity.</p>
    <p>It has also not helped us avoid both an over- and un­der­sup­ply of labour in in­dus­tries such as law and health­care in the past.</p>
    <p>So one should not rely on the Gov­ern­ment to “fu­ture-proof” our chil­dren.</p>
    <p>It does not have a crys­tal ball.</p>
