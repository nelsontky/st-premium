    <p>NEW YORK • As the coro­n­avirus cut a dev­as­tat­ing path around the United States, Ms Laura Lif­fi­ton, 32, found her­self rac­ing along be­hind.</p>
    <p>She ar­rived in New York City in April, on one of the worst days of the pan­demic, for a stint as a nurse in the over­run in­ten­sive care unit of a crowded hos­pi­tal.</p>
    <p>Af­ter her con­tract there ended, she flew in July to an­other hot spot with an ur­gent need for nurses: a hos­pi­tal in Ari­zona where four of her pa­tients died of the coro­n­avirus on her first day.</p>
    <p>In Oc­to­ber, she trav­elled to Green Bay, Wis­con­sin, just as the virus was surg­ing un­con­trol­lably through­out the Mid­west.</p>
    <p>“When the pan­demic be­gan, I thought, ‘I’m go­ing to go help, I can do some good, I can make some good money,’ ” she said.</p>
    <p>But on the first day of treat­ing coro­n­avirus pa­tients, Ms Lif­fi­ton re­mem­bered: “I was like Dorothy land­ing in Oz. I was to­tally un­pre­pared for the re­al­ity.”</p>
    <p>As in­fec­tions have spiked across the coun­try, travel nurses, who work on tem­po­rary con­tracts for higher fees and move from city to city, have be­come more urgently needed than ever.</p>
    <p>Cen­tres for Dis­ease Con­trol and Preven­tion direc­tor Robert Red­field warned that the US was fac­ing a dev­as­tat­ing win­ter, pre­dict­ing that to­tal deaths from Covid-19 could reach close to 450,000 by next Fe­bru­ary un­less a large per­cent­age of Amer­i­cans fol­low pre­cau­tions like mask-wear­ing.</p>
    <p>“The re­al­ity is, De­cem­ber and January and Fe­bru­ary are go­ing to be rough times,” he said. “I ac­tu­ally be­lieve they’re go­ing to be the most dif­fi­cult time in the pub­lic health his­tory of this na­tion.”</p>
    <p>As hos­pi­tals fill with virus pa­tients, the big­gest need has been find­ing enough staff to tend to the crit­i­cally ill. De­mand for travel nurses has in­creased by more than 40 per cent in the past month, ac­cord­ing to Aya Health­care, an agency based in Cal­i­for­nia that dis­patches them to hos­pi­tals.</p>
    <p>At least 25,000 nurses work in travel nurs­ing, though the num­ber fluc­tu­ates, and hos­pi­tals have de</p>
    <p>pended on them for decades. It is a no­madic ex­is­tence and, in a pan­demic, a par­tic­u­larly high-risk one.</p>
    <p>The nurses para­chute into cities like New York, Phoenix, Los An­ge­les and Green Bay for weeks or months at a time, quickly learn­ing the ways of a new hos­pi­tal and try­ing to earn the trust of ex­ist­ing staff.</p>
    <p>At the end of their shifts, they re­turn to their tem­po­rary homes: ho­tels, Airbnb apart­ments or rented houses. Their fam­i­lies and friends are some­times thou­sands of kilo­me­tres away, avail­able only through phone calls or Face­Time.</p>
    <p>Through­out the pan­demic, Mr</p>
    <p>John Deaton, an­other travel nurse, has treated Covid-19 pa­tients and even caught a mild case of the virus him­self, work­ing in El Cen­tro, Cal­i­for­nia, near the bor­der with Mex­ico; Sacra­mento, Cal­i­for­nia; and now Green Bay.</p>
    <p>Places to stay in north-eastern Wis­con­sin were dif­fi­cult to find. He set­tled for rent­ing the base­ment in a house while the owner lived up­stairs, ne­go­ti­at­ing for shared use of the kitchen so he would have more than a mi­crowave to use for cook­ing.</p>
    <p>The dy­namic be­tween staff nurses and travel nurses can be com­pli­cated. Mr Deaton, 27, said that when he was in Sacra­mento, staff nurses were given higher-qual­ity equip­ment to use, such as air-pu­ri­fy­ing res­pi­ra­tors, that travel nurses had to re­peat­edly re­quest.</p>
    <p>“We’re here be­cause they have a need,” he said of hos­pi­tals. “We’re not peo­ple that are go­ing to be here later on.”</p>
    <p>Last month in Green Bay, where the sur­round­ing county has av­er­aged more than 150 cases a day since late Septem­ber, a team of four travel nurses worked at Bellin Hos­pi­tal, grap­pling with the un­re­lent­ing pres­sure of the emer­gency room and a Thanks­giv­ing hol­i­day far from home.</p>
    <p>More than eight months into the pan­demic, many travel nurses have done lit­tle else but treat Covid-19 pa­tients.</p>
    <p>Ms Lif­fi­ton shud­ders when re­count­ing what she saw in New York in April: doc­tors and nurses who were over­whelmed, rows of in­tu­bated pa­tients and lit­tle sense of when the dev­as­ta­tion would end.</p>
    <p>She still sleeps only about four hours a night, trou­bled by what she has seen through­out the pan­demic. “It’s hard,” she said. “Even af­ter I leave a place, the feel­ings stay.”</p>
    <p>Ms Mor­gan Fitzsim­mons, 26, a travel nurse based in Lake Geneva, Wis­con­sin, has been treat­ing coro­n­avirus pa­tients since a stint in Syra­cuse, New York, in July.</p>
    <p>In Green Bay, where she is tem­po­rar­ily based, the weather has now turned cold and blus­tery. Some peo­ple are still gath­er­ing in­doors, go­ing to bars and to restau­rants and wed­dings.</p>
    <p>Just be­fore the elec­tion, Ms Fitzsim­mons said, she was treat­ing a pa­tient who re­peated a con­spir­acy the­ory that has cir­cu­lated on the In­ter­net and in con­ser­va­tive me­dia: The coro­n­avirus is a hoax per­pet­u­ated by Democrats.</p>
    <p>“I’m tak­ing care of this man and he said, ‘I can’t wait for the elec­tion to be over so all this will all go away,’ ” she said. “And I’m like, ‘That’s not hap­pen­ing. It’s real, I prom­ise you, it’s real.’ ”</p>
    <p>Oth­ers have all but shrugged when they re­ceive a pos­i­tive coro­n­avirus re­sult.</p>
    <p>“A lot of peo­ple tend to have the re­sponse, when they’re told they have it, they’re like, ‘Oh, I’ve got the Covid’,” said Ms Heather Oz­mun, 46, a travel nurse in Green Bay.</p>
    <p>“They’re treat­ing it like a rite of pas­sage, like it’s their turn to have it.”</p>
