    <p>Mariah Carey’s Mag­i­cal Christ­mas Spe­cial de­buts on Ap­ple TV+ on Fri­day – 16 years af­ter her now­iconic fes­tive an­them, All I Want For Christ­mas Is You, first hit the air­waves.</p>
    <p>Why did the song – the best-sell­ing hol­i­day sin­gle of all time – be­come such a clas­sic?</p>
    <p>The 50-year-old diva – one of the best-sell­ing record­ing artists of all time, with the most No. 1 sin­gles by a solo artist – ad­mits she did not an­tic­i­pate its en­dur­ing pop­u­lar­ity and did not ap­pre­ci­ate the song as much as she does now.</p>
    <p>Carey, who has been dubbed the “Queen of Christ­mas”, talks to the press in a video call from her home. She is dressed to the nines in a sil­ver-se­quin num­ber, a fluffy white dog nestling in her lap, even though it is 2am in Los An­ge­les, where she is.</p>
    <p>The spe­cial will fea­ture mu­si­cal per­for­mances and guest stars, in­clud­ing Ari­ana Grande and</p>
    <p>Jen­nifer Hud­son, who will join her in singing a sin­gle she co-wrote, Oh Santa!, that will be re­leased on Ap­ple Mu­sic and other stream­ing plat­forms on Fri­day.</p>
    <p>The com­pan­ion sound­track to the spe­cial will be on Ap­ple Mu­sic the same day and on other plat­forms on Dec 11.</p>
    <p>Why do you think All I Want For Christ­mas Is You has been such a phe­nom­e­non?</p>
    <p>It’s been an in­ter­est­ing j our­ney with it. I wrote this song so long ago – it’s the first Christ­mas song I wrote – and I feel like I grew into lov­ing it more. As time has gone by, I’ve really ap­pre­ci­ated it.</p>
    <p>And peo­ple have con­nected to this song in a way I never ex­pected. So, it’s my Christ­mas gift.</p>
    <p>You sing with Ari­ana Grande and Snoop Dogg on the spe­cial. What was that like?</p>
    <p>We were all ex­cited about the col­lab­o­ra­tion with Ari­ana and Jen­nifer Hud­son for Oh Santa!, and that re­quired a bit more of me as a pro­ducer, struc­tur­ing the song for three voices rather than just for me. And we really had fun with it.</p>
    <p>Snoop sur­prised me at the last minute. He was, like, “I really want to do some­thing for the kids for Christ­mas”. And you’ll just have to watch the spe­cial to see what he did and how he came through.</p>
    <p>What is the big­gest chal­lenge in mak­ing new pop mu­sic to­day?</p>
    <p>I think you have to be open­minded to col­lab­o­ra­tions and ex­plor­ing all dif­fer­ent styles of mu­sic.</p>
    <p>And you can’t try too hard to make a hit – that doesn’t feel or­ganic to me. It has to come from within you and, hope­fully, peo­ple feel it in the same way you do.</p>
    <p>Did the pan­demic af­fect the film­ing of the spe­cial or how you ap­proached it?</p>
    <p>The goal was to just do the best, most fes­tive and most beau­ti­ful Christ­mas spe­cial we could, es­pe­cially with this year be­ing so dif­fi­cult. And thank­fully, we were able to pull it off dur­ing the pan­demic. Luck­ily, we had al­ready started con­cep­tu­al­is­ing it be­fore and ev­ery­body who worked on it was great.</p>
    <p>What sort of hol­i­day tra­di­tions do you have with your nineyear-old twins, Moroc­can and Mon­roe, who also ap­pear on the spe­cial?</p>
    <p>I al­ways hope they have the best Christ­mas ever and I really try. They gave me their Christ­mas lists yes­ter­day, which were very large.</p>
    <p>We have our tra­di­tions – ev­ery­thing from watch­ing Christ­mas movies to­gether to con­stantly lis­ten­ing to Christ­mas songs – to the point where I’m, like, “I hope I’m not over­do­ing this for them. I don’t want them to grow up and com­plain, ‘She made us cel­e­brate all the time’”.</p>
    <p>But they al­ways say, ‘We can’t wait for Christ­mas’, and I think this year, of all years, there’s go­ing to be a lot of ex­cite­ment just to be cel­e­brat­ing.</p>
    <p>Are you nos­tal­gic for a time when Christ­mas was sim­pler</p>
    <p>and less com­mer­cialised or do you en­joy the over-the-top as­pect of it?</p>
    <p>I def­i­nitely en­joy the over-the-top as­pect. But it is ul­ti­mately about the spirit of it be­cause you can’t do the over-the-top thing if it’s not some­thing you love.</p>
    <p>And there are some things that are not as over-the-top as they could be and that’s why they res­onate with you – like a sim­ple Christ­mas tree and not a pink plas­tic thing with a bunch of mul­ti­coloured lights.</p>
    <p>But some­one might like that pink tree – that might be their Christ­mas fan­tasy. I know that it is kind of one of mine.</p>
