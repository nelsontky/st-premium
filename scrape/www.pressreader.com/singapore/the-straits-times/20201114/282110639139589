    <p>Sin­ga­pore­ans are wel­com­ing the news that they will be able to travel to Hong Kong for leisure from Nov 22 in the first air travel bub­ble ar­range­ment for the Repub­lic since bor­der re­stric­tions were im­posed amid the coro­n­avirus pan­demic. The scheme will be­gin with one flight a day into each city, with a quota of 200 trav­ellers a flight. This will be in­creased to two flights a day from Dec 7. The cal­i­brated lift­ing of travel re­stric­tions re­flects the close re­la­tion­ship be­tween the two economies, which have com­peted and col­lab­o­rated on their way to be­com­ing iconic Asian des­ti­na­tions for travel, busi­ness and res­i­dence. Covid-19 has hurt both badly, but it is time to re­new the spe­cial link be­tween them.</p>
    <p>Of course, the ar­range­ment is ten­ta­tive. Although there will be no re­stric­tions on the pur­pose of travel and no in­sis­tence on a con­trolled itin­er­ary, those trav­el­ling to Sin­ga­pore and Hong Kong will have to take Covid-19 tests in lieu of serv­ing quar­an­tine or stay-home no­tices. Also, the ar­range­ment will be sus­pended for two weeks if the seven-day mov­ing av­er­age of the daily num­ber of un­linked Covid-19 cases is more than five in ei­ther Sin­ga­pore or Hong Kong.</p>
    <p>Clearly, the Sin­ga­pore and Hong Kong au­thor­i­ties are closely mind­ful of the need to up­hold the strin­gent health pro­to­cols that are in place in both ju­ris­dic­tions, but also wish to probe the pos­si­bil­i­ties of the air bub­ble which cov­ers them, as na­tions seek an eco­nomic and so­cial way out of the lock­downs that have dev­as­tated the avi­a­tion sec­tor. Such tem­po­rary ar­range­ments be­tween coun­tries or ter­ri­to­ries, aimed at restart­ing com­mer­cial pas­sen­ger ser­vices while reg­u­lar in­ter­na­tional flights are sus­pended, are im­por­tant to air­lines and also to trav­ellers, whose in­ter­na­tional in­ter­ac­tions have been un­der­cut by Covid-19. The key re­quire­ment is the trust that one side pos­sesses in the other’s ca­pac­ity to con­trol the trans­mis­sion of the dis­ease within its bor­ders. Aus­tralia has moved to open its avi­a­tion bor­ders with New Zealand – which has shown re­mark­able suc­cess in con­tain­ing the out­break of the pan­demic – with a de­ci­sion to al­low res­i­dents there to travel to sev­eral Aus­tralian states with­out quar­an­tine. Can­berra has also said it is in the midst of dis­cus­sions with Asian ter­ri­to­ries such as Ja­pan, South Korea, Sin­ga­pore and Tai­wan on ex­pand­ing its travel bub­ble.</p>
    <p>Air bub­bles will sur­vive only so long as they are se­cure. So it is with the Sin­ga­pore-Hong Kong bub­ble. It falls on trav­ellers too to en­sure that they are Covid-19-free when vis­it­ing ei­ther place. Also, they must ad­here to the bor­der con­trol mea­sures and pub­lic health re­quire­ments of both lo­ca­tions. It would be a pity if this ten­ta­tive but im­por­tant step out­side bor­ders were to be de­railed by ir­re­spon­si­ble trav­ellers who fly out even when they know that they should not.</p>
