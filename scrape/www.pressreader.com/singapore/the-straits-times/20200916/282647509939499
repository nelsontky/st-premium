    <p>It is strik­ing how much the Oppo Watch re­sem­bles the Ap­ple Watch. With its rec­tan­gu­lar watch case and curved cor­ners, this smart­watch will make many do a dou­ble take when they re­alise it runs on Google’s Wear OS smart­watch op­er­at­ing sys­tem.</p>
    <p>It comes in two sizes – 41mm and 46mm (ver­sion tested) – and in gold, black and sil­ver (41mm only).</p>
    <p>The left side of its alu­minium watch case houses the speak­ers, sim­i­lar to the Ap­ple Watch, while the right side has two slim but­tons. It has no ro­tat­ing crown, which the Ap­ple Watch has.</p>
    <p>At the back are two push but­tons for re­leas­ing the watch straps – again sim­i­lar to the Ap­ple Watch.</p>
    <p>How­ever, I think Oppo’s im­ple­men­ta­tion is bet­ter.</p>
    <p>With the Ap­ple Watch, you have to slide the strap side­ways to re­move it after press­ing the re­lease but­ton. With the Oppo Watch, you just pull the strap and it comes out eas­ily.</p>
    <p>The 46mm model is said to have the world’s first flex­i­ble dual-curved Amoled dis­play on a smart­watch, with a screen size of 1.91 inches.</p>
    <p>The dis­play looks sleek and curves nicely to its sides. It also looks sharp with nice con­trast­ing colours. Swip­ing and tap­ping feel smooth and re­spon­sive.</p>
    <p>If you have been us­ing a Wear OS smart­watch, you will be fa­mil­iar with its ges­tures and swipes.</p>
    <p>For ex­am­ple, swip­ing right from the left side of the screen brings up Google As­sis­tant, while swip­ing up­wards brings up current no­ti­fi­ca­tions.</p>
    <p>But there are some dif­fer­ences in Oppo’s Wear OS to take into ac­count its rec­tan­gu­lar watch face.</p>
    <p>For in­stance, in­stead of the usual line-by-line app ar­range­ment, apps are or­gan­ised in a 3x3 grid, which lets you see more apps at a glance.</p>
    <p>The Oppo Watch of­fers a great smart­watch ex­pe­ri­ence when con­nected to an An­droid smart­phone.</p>
    <p>No­ti­fi­ca­tions from dif­fer­ent apps of­fer con­tex­tual ac­tions, while you can re­spond to any mes­sage with quick replies by typ­ing, scrib­bling or dic­ta­tion.</p>
    <p>On the fit­ness front, the Oppo Watch of­fers all-day heart-rate monitoring, as well as phys­i­cal ac­tiv­ity and sleep track­ing.</p>
    <p>In terms of step track­ing, it tracks 5 per cent more steps than my cal­i­brated Ap­ple Watch Se­ries 4.</p>
    <p>On my usual 5km jog­ging route, it tracks around 100m less than the ac­tual dis­tance.</p>
    <p>For sleep track­ing, the Oppo Watch is sup­posed to track the length of time you are awake, in light and deep sleep. How­ever, it does not record when I wake up for toi­let breaks.</p>
    <p>And, strangely, the sleep track­ing func­tion works only be­tween 8pm and 10am, so your weekend sleepins may not be prop­erly tracked.</p>
    <p>The Oppo Watch fea­tures a unique dual-chip sys­tem, with Qual­comm’s Snap­dragon Wear 3100 used for smart­watch func­tions and Am­biq Mi­cro’s Apollo3 Wire­less SoC for the power saver mode.</p>
    <p>Bat­tery life is rated at 36 hours in smart­watch mode and up to 21 days in power saver mode.</p>
    <p>In my test, bat­tery life drops to 58 per cent at the end of a work day. As such, I find my­self wor­ry­ing whether there will be enough juice left for the next day if I wear it to sleep with­out recharg­ing it.</p>
    <p>While you can switch on the power saver mode to just tell time, it de­feats the pur­pose of hav­ing a smart­watch.</p>
