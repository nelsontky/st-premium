    <p>Em­ploy­ees, es­pe­cially older ones, are more con­cerned about be­ing re­trenched or be­com­ing ir­rel­e­vant in the in­creas­ingly un­cer­tain job mar­ket, a sur­vey noted.</p>
    <p>It found that 90 per cent of re­spon­dents em­ployed in Sin­ga­pore be­lieve they will need to reskill or up­skill to stay com­pet­i­tive in the post-pan­demic world.</p>
    <p>Em­ploy­ees also ex­pect it will be tough to se­cure new roles, given the re­ces­sion, while 88 per cent feel that com­pa­nies will pre­fer can­di­dates who can per­form mul­ti­ple roles.</p>
    <p>The poll by United Over­seas Bank (UOB) also found that 87 per cent ex­pect em­ploy­ers to dig­i­talise in­stead of hir­ing staff or turn to re­trench­ments to cut costs.</p>
    <p>Con­cerns around job se­cu­rity were felt most strongly by older Sin­ga­pore­ans, with a marked 98 per cent of those be­tween 56 and 65 fo­cused on reskilling and up­skilling to stay rel­e­vant. About 90 per cent of those aged 24 to 55 said the same.</p>
    <p>The study was con­ducted by UOB and data ser­vices com­pany Black­box in July among 3,510 in­di­vid­u­als aged 18 to 65 in five South-east Asian coun­tries, in­clud­ing 1,030 here.</p>
    <p>The pan­demic has reaf­firmed the im­por­tance of adapt­abil­ity and con­tin­ual learn­ing to en­sure peo­ple are ready to take on chang­ing job de­mands and seize op­por­tu­ni­ties, said Mr Dean Tong, UOB head of group hu­man re­sources.</p>
    <p>He added that as dig­i­tal­i­sa­tion ac­cel­er­ates, it is im­per­a­tive that em­ploy­ees de­velop the skills needed for a fu­ture of work dom­i­nated by dig­i­tal tech­nol­ogy and data.</p>
