    <p>Clean­ing floors, mon­i­tor­ing pests and other la­bo­ri­ous tasks in main­tain­ing fa­cil­i­ties such as food cen­tres could soon be done by ro­bots.</p>
    <p>Five ro­bots which do tasks like clean­ing the floor, in­spect­ing false ceil­ings, dis­in­fect­ing lift pan­els and map­ping the den­sity of mos­qui­toes in the sur­round­ings are be­ing testbed­ded at Tampines Round Mar­ket and Food Cen­tre, and could be rolled out to other food cen­tres in fu­ture.</p>
    <p>The ro­bots are in­tended to relieve clean­ers and work­ers of stren­u­ous, repet­i­tive tasks, and to free them up to ful­fil other higher-value roles which could see them tak­ing on new skills such as han­dling the ro­bots, said Tampines Town Coun­cil.</p>
    <p>Tampines GRC MPs, in­clud­ing Min­is­ter for So­cial and Fam­ily De­vel­op­ment Masa­gos Zulk­i­fli, were at the cen­tre in Tampines Street 11 to see the ro­bots in ac­tion yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>“Ro­bot­ics is a very im­por­tant part of how we are go­ing to trans­form the econ­omy,” Mr Masa­gos said. “This is both im­por­tant for the now, so that we are able to be more pro­duc­tive, but also for the fu­ture, when in Sin­ga­pore par­tic­u­larly, man­power is go­ing to be a very big chal­lenge 10, 15 years down the line.</p>
    <p>“(It’s) bet­ter to be ready now, pro­duce th­ese tech­nolo­gies, then de­ploy them, learn from them,” he said.</p>
    <p>The main­te­nance ro­bots are de­vel­oped by en­gi­neers from the Sin­ga­pore Univer­sity of Tech­nol­ogy and De­sign (SUTD) and the project is funded by the Na­tional Ro­bot­ics Pro­gramme. They will be de­ployed at the mar­ket and its sur­round­ings. The one han­dling the in­spec­tion of false ceil­ings will also be used to chase away pi­geons and my­nahs by emit­ting sound fre­quen­cies which tar­get th­ese birds.</p>
    <p>Around 20 full-time en­gi­neers from the univer­sity, along­side a mix of un­der­grad­u­ate and post­grad­u­ate stu­dents, are work­ing on the project, which in­cludes five other ro­bots for clean­ing and fa­cil­ity man­age­ment be­ing de­vel­oped that could be test-bed­ded in Tampines as well.</p>
    <p>The ro­bots took be­tween two and five months of de­vel­op­ment be­fore they were ready for test­ing, said SUTD’s As­sis­tant Pro­fes­sor Mo­han Ra­jesh Elara.</p>
    <p>He said the ro­bots are be­ing de­ployed in the Tampines mar­ket for real-life test­ing and “fi­nal fine-tun­ing”. The univer­sity is in talks with man­u­fac­tur­ers to iden­tify how the prod­ucts can be com­mer­cialised, he added.</p>
    <p>The project, which is also sup­ported by the Na­tional En­vi­ron­ment Agency, could also see the ro­bots be­ing rolled out at other food cen­tres here, Dr Mo­han said.</p>
    <p>A spokesman for Tampines Town Coun­cil said that 14 clean­ers in the precinct will be part of the pi­lot and will un­dergo about one to two weeks of train­ing to use th­ese ro­bots. Us­ing ro­bots does not mean that the work­ers’ jobs are cut. In­stead, it pro­vides up­skilling op­por­tu­ni­ties for work­ers, he added, not­ing that with ro­bots tak­ing over the rou­tine jobs, clean­ers could fo­cus on the sani­tis­ing roles which are dif­fi­cult for the equip­ment to han­dle.</p>
    <p>Com­ment­ing on this, Mr Masa­gos em­pha­sised the im­por­tance of col­lab­o­ra­tion be­tween hu­mans and tech­nol­ogy. “Ro­bots will never take over our jobs...We will find use for the ro­bots where it is ei­ther dan­ger­ous for our work­ers to go, or (where) it is not a pro­duc­tive way of de­ploy­ing our labour, at the same time, cre­at­ing new op­por­tu­ni­ties.”</p>
