    <p>Net­flix doc­u­men­tary Ath­lete A on the phys­i­cal and sex­ual abuse in­flicted on hun­dreds of Amer­i­can gym­nasts helped un­ravel more tes­ti­monies of coach abuse in other coun­tries, in­clud­ing that of Sin­ga­porean fig­ure skater Yu Shu­ran and for­mer na­tional gym­nast Eileen Chai while they were train­ing in China (Ed­u­ca­tion key in fight against ath­lete abuse: Ex­perts, Aug 20)</p>
    <p>For the most part, peo­ple seem to over­look abuse or ha­rass­ment in­volv­ing psy­cho­log­i­cal abuse and ne­glect in the sports com­mu­nity.</p>
    <p>Just re­cently, a South Korean triath­lete com­mit­ted sui­cide af­ter years of phys­i­cal and ver­bal abuse by coaches, and af­ter her com­plaints were ig­nored by the sport­ing au­thor­i­ties.</p>
    <p>Hav­ing been in­volved with sports for over 30 years, I have heard and wit­nessed psy­cho­log­i­cal abuse and ne­glect. It is com­mon to see abu­sive coaches yelling at ath­letes or of­fi­cials, and irate coaches yelling dis­parag­ing re­marks and threats to their un­der­per­form­ing ath­letes.</p>
    <p>Some abu­sive be­hav­iours have hap­pened in the pres­ence of teach­ers and par­ents, who were ei­ther obliv­i­ous to or ig­nored the abuse in the heat of com­pe­ti­tion. The fine line be­tween what is ac­cept­able and what is not be­comes blurred.</p>
    <p>The abuse tends to be brushed aside as part of tough­en­ing young ath­letes in the pur­suit of sports ex­cel­lence. A 2012 study of over a thou­sand ath­letes par­tic­i­pat­ing in the Min­istry of Ed­u­ca­tion schools’ com­pe­ti­tions found nearly half of them hav­ing neg­a­tive sports ex­pe­ri­ences.</p>
    <p>Do we re­ally have ad­e­quate safe­guards to pro­tect vul­ner­a­ble ath­letes from abuse?</p>
    <p>Cer­tainly sports or­gan­i­sa­tions would have estab­lished safe sports and child pro­tec­tion poli­cies. Yet, the abuse still hap­pened and were mostly re­vealed much later by for­mer ath­letes.</p>
    <p>Per­haps the rel­e­vant au­thor­i­ties could re-ex­am­ine and strengthen cur­rent safe sport poli­cies.</p>
    <p>For ex­am­ple, ath­letes could be in­ter­viewed anony­mously to check on po­ten­tial abuse or ha­rass­ment.</p>
    <p>Sec­ond, cre­ate a safe and con­ve­nient way for ath­letes to speak up if they wit­ness or ex­pe­ri­ence any form of abuse.</p>
    <p>It is com­mon to see abu­sive coaches yelling at ath­letes or of­fi­cials, and irate coaches yelling dis­parag­ing re­marks and threats to their un­der­per­form­ing ath­letes... The fine line be­tween what is ac­cept­able and what is not be­comes blurred.</p>
