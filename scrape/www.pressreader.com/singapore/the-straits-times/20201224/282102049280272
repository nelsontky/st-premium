    <p>For over a decade, teenage girls in­volved in Project Pari have learnt how to code, man­age their fi­nances and even take part in an out­door trek.</p>
    <p>Next year, 100 young women from four se­condary schools will be able to pick up a new sport, tag rugby, cour­tesy of a part­ner­ship with the Sin­ga­pore Rugby Union (SRU). Tag rugby is a non-con­tact</p>
    <p>ver­sion of rugby in which each player wears a belt that has two vel­cro tags at­tached to it.</p>
    <p>Started by the Zonta Club of Sin­ga­pore in 2008, Project Pari aims to em­power girls from lower-in­come fam­i­lies and help them learn use­ful skills be­yond the class­room. Each ben­e­fi­ciary re­ceives a monthly $50 al­lowance and can par­tic­i­pate in six ac­tiv­i­ties, in­clud­ing an out­door trek and two work­shops teach­ing life skills.</p>
    <p>The sports work­shop next year is a first for the or­gan­i­sa­tion and its vice-pres­i­dent, Ms Lyn­nette Ee, said that the ini­tia­tive is in line with the club’s mis­sion of ex­pos­ing its ben­e­fi­cia­ries to as many things as pos­si­ble.</p>
    <p>She said: “Be­sides learn­ing about the sport, you learn about team­work and build­ing re­la­tion­ships with each other. Our pri­mary ob­jec­tive is to get them out of their zone of com­fort as much as pos­si­ble, which is im­por­tant to em­power a per­son.”</p>
    <p>Slated to start in the first quar­ter</p>
    <p>of 2021, the ses­sions will be taught by coaches and play­ers from the na­tional women’s team.</p>
    <p>The SRU also aims to raise $100,000 for Project Pari, with $10,000 raised so far through a vir­tual work­out led by na­tional women’s rugby player Chong Hui Min for em­ploy­ees of Dell Tech­nolo­gies.</p>
    <p>SRU’s sup­port for Project Pari is part of its Rugby Gives Back ini­tia­tive and is done in col­lab­o­ra­tion with so­cial en­ter­prise Elpis @ Hide­out. Mr Dou­glas Dana­pal, SRU’s head of com­mer­cial, pub­lic re­la­tions and mar­ket­ing, said: “It’s also about show­ing that rugby is not just a man’s sport and there are a lot of fe­male ath­letes play­ing who have also gone on to take roles in sports.”</p>
    <p>Ms Ee be­lieves that the tag rugby ses­sions will be a hit among the girls and will con­sider in­tro­duc­ing adding more sports to their pro­grammes in the fu­ture.</p>
