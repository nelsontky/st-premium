    <p>Hong Kong yes­ter­day an­nounced the tight­en­ing of re­stric­tions aimed at con­tain­ing a fresh wave of Covid-19 cases. It is lim­it­ing gath­er­ings to no more than two peo­ple, clos­ing karaoke lounges and telling most civil ser­vants to work from home.</p>
    <p>HONG KONG • Hong Kong in­tro­duced the city’s tough­est pub­lic gath­er­ing re­stric­tions in months and de­cided to send civil ser­vants back to work-from-home ar­range­ments, as the au­thor­i­ties bat­tle a fourth wave of in­fec­tions.</p>
    <p>Pub­lic gath­er­ings will be lim­ited to two peo­ple – down from four – in­clud­ing at restau­rant ta­bles and at sports venues, Chief Ex­ec­u­tive Car­rie Lam said at a brief­ing yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The new mea­sures will go into ef­fect to­mor­row and last two weeks, she said.</p>
    <p>The slew of re­stric­tions comes as Hong Kong recorded 76 new coro­n­avirus cases, with most of them be­ing lo­cal trans­mis­sions and nine cases be­ing un­trace­able.</p>
    <p>The fi­nan­cial hub has main­tained bans on large group gath­er­ings for much of the year and has shut­tered var­i­ous in­dus­tries when cases have spiked.</p>
    <p>The mea­sures have helped keep in­fec­tions to just over 6,300 in the city of 7.5 mil­lion, with 109 deaths.</p>
    <p>But daily cases have risen above 100 in re­cent days, prompt­ing the au­thor­i­ties to usher in stricter mea­sures sim­i­lar to those an­nounced in July, when the city faced its worst out­break.</p>
    <p>“This new wave of Covid-19 has hit Hong Kong very quickly,” Mrs Lam told re­porters.</p>
    <p>The cur­rent resur­gence has al­ready de­layed a planned air travel bub­ble with Sin­ga­pore, and the on­set of colder weather may mean that the spread of the virus is harder to curb.</p>
    <p>The city’s 170,000 civil ser­vants will work from home un­less their jobs are con­sid­ered es­sen­tial, and Mrs Lam asked pri­vate busi­nesses to fol­low suit where pos­si­ble.</p>
    <p>When civil ser­vants were told to work from home dur­ing the last wave of Covid-19 cases, gov­ern­ment ser­vices such as work-visa ex­ten­sions were de­layed.</p>
    <p>Mrs Lam also an­nounced the clo­sure of venues such as mahjong par­lours, swim­ming pools and amuse­ment parks. And restau­rants will have to shorten dine-in hours, end­ing them at 10pm.</p>
    <p>Hong Kong ear­lier an­nounced that schools would shut again from to­mor­row. Bars and night­clubs had also been or­dered to close.</p>
    <p>Gyms and beauty par­lours can re­main open, but with stricter lim­its on peo­ple per venue or class.</p>
    <p>Mrs Lam said fa­tigue had set in among Hong Kongers, a com­mu­nity that took the coro­n­avirus se­ri­ously from the get-go.</p>
    <p>The au­thor­i­ties plan to in­crease the cur­rent HK$2,000 (S$345) spot fines and will launch a hot­line for peo­ple to re­port so­cial dis­tanc­ing breaches.</p>
    <p>The po­lice will also play a more proac­tive role in stop­ping breaches and go­ing af­ter pri­vate venues host­ing par­ties or large gath­er­ings, Mrs Lam said.</p>
    <p>One of the su­per-spreader events that helped cause the cur­rent wave was linked to ball­room danc­ing nights pop­u­lar with many well-heeled res­i­dents.</p>
    <p>“They went out in groups, they did not wear masks, they con­tin­ued to en­joy them­selves in par­ties,” Mrs Lam said of the re­cent breaches. “They danced in close con­tact... So we need to raise the fine,” she added.</p>
