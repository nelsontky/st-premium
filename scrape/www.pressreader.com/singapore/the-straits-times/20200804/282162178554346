    <p>A global fes­ti­val for pro­fes­sion­als in the fin­tech and deeptech in­dus­tries will re­turn to Sin­ga­pore in De­cem­ber this year, in a for­mat that will al­low par­tic­i­pants to at­tend events, both dig­i­tal and phys­i­cal, when­ever they want and wher­ever they are.</p>
    <p>The hy­brid af­fair, to meet Covid-19 so­cial dis­tanc­ing rules, will be a spe­cial fea­ture of the se­cond Sin­ga­pore Fin­Tech Fes­ti­val (SFF) x the Sin­ga­pore Week of In­no­va­tion and TeCH­nol­ogy (SWITCH), which will be held from Dec 7-11.</p>
    <p>An­other new fea­ture of the five­day fes­ti­val in­volves high­light­ing the strength and re­silience shown by some firms and trail­blaz­ing pi­o­neers, Mon­e­tary Author­ity of Sin­ga­pore (MAS) man­ag­ing di­rec­tor Ravi Menon said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>“2020 is go­ing to go down in his­tory as the year of the pan­demic, and the hu­man cost is tragic, the eco­nomic cost is wide­spread.</p>
    <p>“But I think that story would not be com­plete if we also did not tell the story of the peo­ple who ex­hib­ited great courage, re­silience and cre­ativ­ity in the face of ad­ver­sity, who found so­lu­tions to how life can carry on, how so­ci­eties can con­tinue to func­tion,” he said at a me­dia brief­ing on Zoom to launch the event.</p>
    <p>MAS is or­gan­is­ing it with En­ter­prise Sin­ga­pore and the Na­tional Re­search Foun­da­tion.</p>
    <p>With its hy­brid form, par­tic­i­pants can take part in the fes­ti­val’s ac­tiv­i­ties at any time of the day, said MAS and En­ter­prise Sin­ga­pore in a joint state­ment yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>As th­ese ac­tiv­i­ties will in­clude panel dis­cus­sions that will take place on video-con­fer­enc­ing plat­forms across the globe and streamed through­out the event, par­tic­i­pants can go on­line any time to watch them.</p>
    <p>The or­gan­is­ers have dubbed it the world’s first “round-the-clock” event, in which par­tic­i­pants can gain in­sights from global thought lead­ers on deeptech and fin­tech is­sues as well as net­work with in­ter­na­tional in­no­va­tors, in­vestors and col­lab­o­ra­tors.</p>
    <p>Last year, about 60,000 peo­ple from 140 coun­tries at­tended the in­au­gu­ral show.</p>
    <p>The coro­n­avirus pan­demic has un­der­scored that in­no­va­tion and re­silience in peo­ple are in­te­gral in over­com­ing chal­lenges, and it is for this rea­son that SFF x SWITCH 2020 will be themed “Peo­ple and Tal­ent”, said the or­gan­is­ers.</p>
    <p>“It will also hon­our in­di­vid­u­als who have demon­strated re­mark­able re­silience in over­com­ing ob­sta­cles to cre­ate new op­por­tu­ni­ties that have sig­nif­i­cantly ad­vanced our so­ci­ety,” they added.</p>
    <p>Yet an­other new fea­ture is the set­ting up of an “on­line city” by or­gan­i­sa­tions, to over­come the ob­sta­cle of par­tic­i­pants not be­ing able to meet many peo­ple phys­i­cally.</p>
    <p>This “city” is a dig­i­tal lo­ca­tion given to each par­tic­i­pat­ing or­gan­i­sa­tion. There, they can share and en­gage with par­tic­i­pants as well as sched­ule one-on-one meet­ings.</p>
    <p>Un­like last year’s event, which was held at Sin­ga­pore Expo, this year’s fes­ti­val will not have a main con­fer­ence in a phys­i­cal lo­ca­tion. Still, there will be phys­i­cal events which the or­gan­is­ers said will be hosted by part­ners around the world.</p>
    <p>“Par­tic­i­pants can ac­cess phys­i­cal events hosted in their cities to net­work with lo­cal gov­ern­ment and in­dus­try lead­ers, learn about the coun­try’s key gov­ern­ment ini­tia­tives and lo­cal early-stage start-ups or ac­cess closed-door round­tables,” they added.</p>
