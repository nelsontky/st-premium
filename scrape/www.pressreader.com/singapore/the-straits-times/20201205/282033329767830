    <p>•</p>
    <p>(Italy) When Mr Franco Or­landi, a usu­ally hale for­mer truck driver, ar­rived in midFe­bru­ary with a cough and fever at an emer­gency room in the north­ern Ital­ian province of Berg­amo, doc­tors de­ter­mined that he had a flu and sent him home. Two days later, an am­bu­lance brought the 83-year-old back. He could not breathe.</p>
    <p>Italy had then not recorded a sin­gle do­mes­tic coro­n­avirus case, but Mr Or­landi’s symp­toms puz­zled Dr Mon­ica Avo­gadri, the 55-year-old anaes­the­si­ol­o­gist who treated him at Pe­senti Fe­naroli Hospi­tal. She did not test him for the virus be­cause Ital­ian pro­to­cols, adopted from the World Health Or­gan­i­sa­tion (WHO), rec­om­mended test­ing only peo­ple with a li nk to China, where the out­break had orig­i­nated.</p>
    <p>When she asked whether Mr Or­landi had a con­nec­tion to China, his wife seemed be­fud­dled. They hardly ever ven­tured beyond their local cafe, Patty’s Bar.</p>
    <p>“China?” Dr Avo­gadri re­called Mr Or­landi’s wife re­spond­ing. “She didn’t even know where it was.”</p>
    <p>What Dr Avo­gadri did not know was that Covid-19 had al­ready ar­rived in her re­gion of Lom­bardy, a dis­cov­ery made five days later by an­other doc­tor in nearby Lodi who broke the na­tional test­ing pro­to­col. By then, Dr Avo­gadri, ham­strung by those same pro­to­cols, had her­self fallen ill af­ter days car­ing for Mr Or­landi and other pa­tients. Her hospi­tal, rather than iden­ti­fy­ing and treat­ing the dis­ease, was ac­cel­er­at­ing its spread across Italy’s eco­nomic heart­land.</p>
    <p>Berg­amo be­came one of the dead­li­est killing fields for the virus in the Western world, a place marked by in­con­ceiv­able suf­fer­ing and a dread­ful sound­track of am­bu­lance sirens as emer­gency med­i­cal work­ers peeled par­ents away from chil­dren, hus­bands from wives, grand­par­ents from their fam­i­lies.</p>
    <p>Hos­pi­tals be­came makeshift morgues and pro­duced pa­rades of coffins and scenes of dev­as­ta­tion that be­came a warn­ing to of­fi­cials in other Western coun­tries of how the virus could rapidly over­whelm health sys­tems and turn in­fir­maries into in­cu­ba­tors.</p>
    <p>Of­fi­cials con­firmed that more than 3,300 peo­ple died with the virus in Berg­amo, though they said the ac­tual toll was prob­a­bly dou­ble that. Mr Or­landi’s town, Nem­bro, be­came per­haps Italy’s hard­est struck, with an 850 per cent in­crease in deaths in March – so many that the local pri­est or­dered a stop to the in­ces­sant tolling of the bells for the dead.</p>
    <p>The ques­tion of how such a tragedy could un­fold in Berg­amo – a wealthy, well-ed­u­cated province of just more than one mil­lion, with top-level hos­pi­tals – has re­mained an un­easy mys­tery, a blood­stain that the gov­ern­ment prefers to avoid as it points with pride to Italy’s suc­cess in flat­ten­ing the first wave of in­fec­tions.</p>
    <p>The WHO’s guid­ance on test­ing en­gen­dered a mis­placed sense of se­cu­rity and helped blind doc­tors to the spread of the virus. But mis­steps and in­ac­tion af­ter Covid-19 ex­ploded into view ag­gra­vated the sit­u­a­tion and cost Berg­amo – and Italy – pre­cious time when min­utes mat­tered most.</p>
    <p>The di­rec­tor of Pe­senti Fe­naroli Hospi­tal closed its doors al­most as soon as he re­alised he had an out­break. But re­gional of­fi­cials or­dered them opened hours later. Hospi­tal work­ers, vis­i­tors and dis­charged pa­tients were ex­posed to the virus and then moved through the province.</p>
    <p>For days, there was an ex­pec­ta­tion that the na­tional gov­ern­ment would lock down towns in Berg­amo as it had ear­lier done im­me­di­ately and de­ci­sively in Lodi. Some may­ors in Berg­amo waited anx­iously for po­lice to seal the bor­ders, even as many busi­ness and local lead­ers ex­pressed re­luc­tance.</p>
    <p>Italy’s Prime Min­is­ter Giuseppe Conte pub­licly turned to a com­mit­tee of sci­en­tific ad­vis­ers, which for­mally pro­posed that he fol­low the ex­am­ple of Lodi and shut down the newly in­fected towns in Berg­amo. Pri­vately, though, na­tional busi­ness lob­bies urged him not to close the area’s fac­to­ries.</p>
    <p>Ul­ti­mately, af­ter crit­i­cal days filled with bu­reau­cratic dither­ing as well as spats be­tween Rome and the re­gional au­thor­i­ties, the gov­ern­ment de­cided the time to save Berg­amo had passed.</p>
    <p>With the virus out of con­trol in the province and clus­ters emerg­ing all around it, the gov­ern­ment waited longer but then went big­ger. Two weeks af­ter Mr Or­landi had tested pos­i­tive, Italy locked down the whole re­gion. Then the coun­try. But Berg­amo was lost.</p>
    <p>MIS­DI­RECTED DOC­TORS</p>
    <p>Now that the coro­n­avirus, deep into its sec­ond wave, has washed across the globe and left vir­tu­ally no na­tion un­touched, it is easy to forget how alone among Western democ­ra­cies Italy was in February, con­fronted with a threat for which it had no play­book.</p>
    <p>Through­out the flu sea­son, some fam­ily doc­tors in the Lom­bardy re­gion had no­ticed strange pneu­mo­nia cases and were pre­scrib­ing more scans than usual.</p>
    <p>The re­gion has busi­ness ties to China, and Ital­ian in­fec­tious dis­ease doc­tors had kept an eye on the coro­n­avirus out­break in the city of Wuhan, China. They also trusted Italy’s new and nar­rower pro­to­cols, adopted from the WHO at the end of Jan­uary, which es­sen­tially lim­ited test­ing to peo­ple linked to China.</p>
    <p>But hardly any of the pneu­mo­nia pa­tients had such a link, which meant that the few peo­ple be­ing tested were mostly air trav­ellers. All had come back neg­a­tive.</p>
    <p>Then, on Feb 20, Dr An­nal­isa Malara, a doc­tor in the town of Codogno, in Lodi province, de­cided to break the pro­to­col and test a 38-year-old man with se­ri­ous pneu­mo­nia who was not re­spond­ing to stan­dard treat­ments. The man’s test came back pos­i­tive that same evening, and he be­came Italy’s first known lo­cally trans­mit­ted case of Covid-19.</p>
    <p>Two days later, on the out­skirts of Rome, an emer­gency meet­ing was held at Italy’s Civil Pro­tec­tion Agency, the na­tional dis­as­ter relief body. Crammed into a small con­fer­ence room, Mr Conte sat at the head of an oval ta­ble, sur­rounded by his min­is­ters, as Health Min­is­ter Roberto Sper­anza pro­posed a dra­matic lock­down of towns in the Lodi area.</p>
    <p>The min­is­ters, ex­chang­ing ner­vous looks, unan­i­mously agreed, and the gov­ern­ment dis­patched Italy’s po­lice and army to seal the bor­ders on Feb 23 – a de­ci­sion that it cites to this day as the met­ric of its bold­ness and will­ing­ness to put</p>
    <p>Italy’s pub­lic health over its econ­omy.</p>
    <p>RIDICULED BY COL­LEAGUES</p>
    <p>The dis­cov­ery of the virus in Lodi, just 96km from Berg­amo, struck Dr Avo­gadri, sick in bed at home, with the force of a rev­e­la­tion.</p>
    <p>She picked up the phone on Feb 21 and called her col­leagues at Pe­senti Fe­naroli, in the town of Alzano Lom­bardo in Berg­amo’s in­dus­trial and densely pop­u­lated Se­rio River Val­ley. She urged them to test her pa­tient, Mr Or­landi.</p>
    <p>At first, they ridiculed her, not­ing that he had never been any­where near China. But other pa­tients on the same floor were de­te­ri­o­rat­ing, and an­other man with sus­pi­cious symp­toms soon ar­rived in the emer­gency room. Hospi­tal of­fi­cials de­cided to swab-test him and one of Mr Or­landi’s room­mates.</p>
    <p>By mid­day of Feb 23, the re­sults were brought to Dr Giuseppe Marzulli, the hospi­tal di­rec­tor. Both tests were pos­i­tive.</p>
    <p>Dr Marzulli grilled the re­port­ing doc­tor about whether the staff had ad­e­quately in­ves­ti­gated con­nec­tions to China. They had. There weren’t any. The virus was al­ready cir­cu­lat­ing in their midst.</p>
    <p>“It was at that mo­ment I un­der­stood we were sc***ed,” Dr Marzulli said. “We had looked for who had been in China, and this was the tragic er­ror.” They swabbed Mr Or­landi that day as mem­bers of his fam­ily moved through crowded cor­ri­dors of the third floor.</p>
    <p>Some vis­i­tors no­ticed staff mem­bers cough­ing.</p>
    <p>Given the gov­ern­ment’s swift ac­tion in Lodi, Dr Marzulli be­gan to pre­pare for a lock­down. He can­celled shift changes so that no new per­son­nel would come in, and he closed the emer­gency room, mind­ful that the hospi­tal had only about a dozen swabs to per­form coro­n­avirus tests.</p>
    <p>“We didn’t have swabs. It was the big­gest prob­lem we had,” he said.</p>
    <p>Hours later, the re­gion and the Berg­amo hospi­tal net­work over­see­ing Pe­senti Fe­naroli de­cided to­gether to re­open the emer­gency room, over Dr Marzulli’s ob­jec­tions.</p>
    <p>On Feb 24, Mr Or­landi’s test re­sults came back. He was pos­i­tive, too. By then, about 50 more pa­tients had ar­rived at the emer­gency room with symp­toms, quickly burn­ing through the hospi­tal’s stock of swabs, Dr Marzulli said.</p>
    <p>A doc­tor, who tested Dr Avo­gadri with one of the avail­able swabs, pressed hospi­tal of­fi­cials for more test kits, re­mind­ing them in a fran­tic e-mail that they had “symp­to­matic col­leagues who have not been swabbed”. His su­pe­ri­ors pleaded with an­other hospi­tal in the re­gion for 100 swabs, ac­cord­ing to e-mail cor­re­spon­dence seen by The New York Times. But</p>
    <p>Dr Marzulli said only half of them made it to Pe­senti Fe­naroli, on Feb 26.</p>
    <p>On Feb 25, Berg­amo province re­ported just 18 cases com­pared with 125 in Lodi. Lom­bardy’s top health of­fi­cial ex­pressed con­cern about con­ta­gion at Pe­senti Fe­naroli but said: “It’s early to say if it’s an­other clus­ter.”</p>
    <p>In Rome, Mr Conte dis­cour­aged ex­pand­ing test­ing, rea­son­ing that health of­fi­cials had to fol­low in­ter­na­tional pro­to­cols, “oth­er­wise we would end up drama­tis­ing” the emer­gency.</p>
    <p>On Feb 26, with 20 re­ported cases in Berg­amo, Rome’s sci­en­tific com­mit­tee said it did not see any flare-ups that re­quired a lock­down. Nem­bro mayor Clau­dio Can­celli said Berg­amo’s health of­fi­cials threat­ened to cut off fund­ing to the area’s 18 may­ors if they closed cen­tres for the elderly or dis­abled.</p>
    <p>The next day, he said, they as­sured the may­ors: “Don’t worry. There is no red zone fore­seen.” But on Feb 28, Berg­amo’s caseload had jumped to 103, against 182 in Lodi. At a Lom­bardy re­gional news con­fer­ence, lead­ing doc­tors iden­ti­fied Pe­senti Fe­naroli Hospi­tal as the out­break’s source.</p>
    <p>Con­find­us­tria Berg­amo, the province’s in­dus­trial as­so­ci­a­tion, re­sponded that same day by post­ing a video ti­tled Berg­amo Is Run­ning. “Cur­rent health warn­ings from Ital­ian gov­ern­ment of­fi­cials are that the risk of in­fec­tion is low,” the nar­ra­tor stated. The im­ages showed fac­to­ries hum­ming.</p>
    <p>Busi­ness lead­ers and even the Alzano Lom­bardo mayor re­sisted a lock­down, telling the local news­pa­per that it would be a tragedy for the econ­omy and con­tact­ing their com­mer­cial as­so­ci­a­tions with in­flu­ence in Rome.</p>
    <p>In the cap­i­tal, Mr Conte stressed that he would be guided by sci­ence alone. He de­clined in­ter­view re­quests for this ar­ti­cle but has de­nied ever re­ceiv­ing re­quests from Con­find­us­tria as his gov­ern­ment weighed what to do in Berg­amo.</p>
    <p>The pow­er­ful in­dus­trial group’s own rep­re­sen­ta­tives said they made their re­quests clear.</p>
    <p>“There was a direct line be­tween Con­find­us­tria and the gov­ern­ment at that time,” said Ms Licia Mat­ti­oli, who was then the group’s vi­cepres­i­dent.</p>
    <p>The lead­er­ship ar­gued di­rectly to Mr Conte that the rapid lock­down of fac­to­ries in Lodi un­nec­es­sar­ily cost jobs and that in Berg­amo’s fac­to­ries steps like so­cial dis­tanc­ing would be suf­fi­cient.</p>
    <p>“What they were say­ing was that to stop all the in­dus­try, also lo­cally, is re­ally very, very dan­ger­ous,” she re­called. “I don’t know if they un­der­stood,” she said of Mr Conte and his min­is­ters. “But they lis­tened, at least.” The fac­to­ries stayed open un­til late March, and many never closed.</p>
    <p>“I can as­sure you that never, never, never we made con­sid­er­a­tions on this,” said Mr Sper­anza, the Health Min­is­ter. “We de­cided since the be­gin­ning that the first point is health; ev­ery­thing else comes af­ter.”</p>
    <p>On March 3, the gov­ern­ment’s sci­en­tific com­mit­tee pro­posed a red zone around Nem­bro and Alzano Lom­bardo. The Lom­bardy au­thor­i­ties con­sid­ered it a done deal. So did Mr Can­celli, the Nem­bro mayor, who was now in­fected and work­ing in iso­la­tion.</p>
    <p>“This place should have been closed in February, when it be­came clear that there were of­fi­cially de­clared cases in the hospi­tal that surely were in con­tact with health work­ers, rel­a­tives, other pa­tients,” Mr Can­celli said. “On March 3 we thought, ‘Now they will close tonight.’” But Mr Conte, who needed to ap­prove the de­ci­sion, has said he did not hear of the plan for two more days.</p>
    <p>In the mean­time, Mr Sper­anza said, he pressed the sci­en­tific com­mit­tee for a re­port on their ra­tio­nale for clos­ing the towns. “They said only, ‘Close’,” Mr Sper­anza said. “You can’t say, ‘I take away the freedom of peo­ple,’ for two words.”</p>
    <p>The In­te­rior Min­istry no­ti­fied Berg­amo’s mil­i­tary po­lice to be­gin prepa­ra­tions for a lock­down, ac­cord­ing to Colonel Paolo Storoni, then the head of the Cara­binieri in the area. Ms Car­men Arzuffi, the owner of Ho­tel Con­ti­nen­tal, said the local po­lice pre­fect called on March 4 to book 50 rooms for 100 in­com­ing of­fi­cers.</p>
    <p>As they ran drills, Mr Conte met on March 6 with the sci­en­tific com­mit­tee in Rome yet again. Ac­cord­ing to Mr Sper­anza, the com­mit­tee told Mr Conte that clos­ing Berg­amo was no longer the is­sue. All of Lom­bardy, in­clud­ing Mi­lan, needed to be locked down. Two days later, on March 8, Mr Conte did just that.</p>
    <p>Mr Conte has por­trayed him­self as urg­ing the sci­en­tists to think big­ger and bolder, say­ing he told them: “Shouldn’t we think of more rad­i­cal mea­sures?” Later that day, po­lice of­fi­cers at the Ho­tel Con­ti­nen­tal packed up and left. “Noth­ing hap­pened,” Mr Can­celli said.</p>
    <p>THE VIRUS PREYED</p>
    <p>As the au­thor­i­ties de­cided what to do, the virus seemed to spread ev­ery­where and touch ev­ery­one. In­fec­tions rav­aged homes and apart­ments. Peo­ple started dy­ing.</p>
    <p>Mr Or­landi, the burly truck driver who had once de­lighted the chil­dren in his fam­ily by thumb wrestling them with his gap­ing hands, died the day af­ter his fam­ily learnt he had con­tracted the virus. Some of his fam­ily be­came in­fected and died, too.</p>
    <p>Dr Avo­gadri’s con­di­tion de­clined and she lost con­scious­ness, even­tu­ally drift­ing into a semi-co­matose state in an in­ten­sive care ward, as she lost half of her hair. “I wanted to die,” she said.</p>
    <p>When she was fi­nally dis­charged, she dis­cov­ered that the doc­tor who man­aged to find her a swab at Pe­senti Fe­naroli Hospi­tal had died and that her older sis­ter, who lived nearby, lay in an in­ten­sive care unit, a breath­ing tube down her throat.</p>
    <p>NO ONE TO BLAME?</p>
    <p>All the au­thor­i­ties in­volved now recog­nise Berg­amo’s losses as a tragedy. But in­vari­ably they lay blame for it else­where.</p>
    <p>The WHO said it lim­ited its case def­i­ni­tions for prac­ti­cal rea­sons – pri­mar­ily, not to waste re­sources at the out­set of an un­cer­tain con­ta­gion. The ra­tio­nale, said Dr Mar­garet Har­ris, a spokesman for the or­gan­i­sa­tion, was “to limit the test­ing to a spe­cific pop­u­la­tion at risk”. It is a po­si­tion that past WHO of­fi­cials con­sid­ered rea­son­able.</p>
    <p>But Dr Har­ris also ar­gued that when the global health agency up­dated the guide­lines at the end of Jan­uary, it made clear “that the pa­tient’s doc­tor is the one, ul­ti­mately, to de­cide who to test”. Doc­tors in Berg­amo con­sid­ered that a con­ve­nient caveat.</p>
    <p>The guid­ance was “the thing that gen­er­ated the huge prob­lem of the spread of the pan­demic”, Dr Avo­gadri said. “It was a big lim­i­ta­tion.”</p>
    <p>The WHO “made a mis­take”, said Italy’s chief med­i­cal of­fi­cer Giuseppe Ruocco, adding that if Italy had not au­to­mat­i­cally fol­lowed the or­gan­i­sa­tion’s lead, it “could have cer­tainly avoided cases and the in­fec­tion of med­i­cal staff”.</p>
    <p>Local of­fi­cials and be­reaved fam­i­lies in Nem­bro and Alzano Lom­bardo ar­gue that clos­ing the towns in February would have slowed the spread of the virus.</p>
    <p>A local pros­e­cu­tor is in­ves­ti­gat­ing what hap­pened and what did not hap­pen and why.</p>
    <p>But the gov­ern­ment would pre­fer to fo­cus on its clos­ing of Lodi and then the re­gion.</p>
    <p>“It’s two small towns that ev­ery­one now knows,” Mr Sper­anza said, when asked how it was pos­si­ble that the Ital­ian pre­mier did not know for three days about the shut­down pro­posal in Berg­amo. “But it’s two small towns.”</p>
    <p>And Mr Conte has dis­missed ques­tions about the bold­ness of his de­ci­sion-mak­ing. “There was no de­lay,” he has in­sisted.</p>
