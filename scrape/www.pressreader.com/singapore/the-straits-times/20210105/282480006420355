    <p>•</p>
    <p>The Chelsea hot seat is start­ing to feel a lit­tle warmer for Frank Lam­pard af­ter Sun­day’s 3-1 home drub­bing by Manch­ester City, mak­ing it four de­feats in six Premier League games.</p>
    <p>Lam­pard’s first sea­son at the helm drew praise with his young side fin­ish­ing fourth last term de­spite a trans­fer ban. But, af­ter spend­ing over £220 mil­lion (S$395 mil­lion) in the sum­mer, their po­si­tion of eighth in the league is rais­ing plenty of eye­brows.</p>
    <p>Just a few weeks ago, Lam­pard’s side were tipped as ti­tle con­tenders, but things have un­rav­elled quickly and they were out­classed at times by a City side badly hit by a Covid-19 out­break and had to give re­serve goal­keeper Zack St­ef­fen his first top-flight start.</p>
    <p>How­ever, Lam­pard has in­sisted he still has the back­ing of owner Ro­man Abramovich, de­spite 11 man­agers hav­ing come and gone since the Rus­sian’s 2003 takeover.</p>
    <p>“I’m not con­cerned (about pres­sure),” said the Chelsea boss, whose side only scored a con­so­la­tion goal in added time via Cal­lum Hud­son-Odoi. “We can have peaks or troughs, I’ve just spo­ken about where we are at.</p>
    <p>“One month ago, ev­ery­one was ask­ing whether I’d sign a new con­tract, now peo­ple will be say­ing dif­fer­ent things be­cause in quick suc­ces­sion over a tight busy pe­riod we’ve lost four games of foot­ball.</p>
    <p>“I un­der­stand it as I played here for a long time. I un­der­stand the minute that you lose a few games in a short pe­riod of time then ev­ery­one looks and asks ques­tions.”</p>
    <p>The ques­tion is how much time Abramovich will give Lam­pard as it is in­creas­ingly look­ing like ex­pen­sive buys like Ger­many duo Timo Werner and Kai Havertz need at least a full sea­son to adapt to the rigours of English foot­ball.</p>
    <p>Pun­dits are al­ready tak­ing bets he is next in line to be sacked de­spite his club leg­end sta­tus as Chelsea’s all-time record scorer.</p>
    <p>“I didn’t re­alise the word pa­tience ex­ists at Chelsea, par­tic­u­larly for man­agers,” for­mer Manch­ester United cap­tain Roy Keane told Sky Sports. “I don’t think Frank is go­ing to get much time. There is huge pres­sure this year be­cause of the money they spent. Chelsea don’t give man­agers time. It’s in their DNA and his­tory.”</p>
    <p>For­mer Liver­pool mid­fielder Graeme Souness added: “The pres­sure comes on you as a man­ager when you start to spend money, es­pe­cially big money.</p>
    <p>“As much as Frank is a leg­end at the club, l don’t think there will be</p>
    <p>a lot of pa­tience shown to him. But he will know the price on the ticket. If you are a man­ager to­day, time is not your friend.”</p>
    <p>While the Blues are in a slump, City look to be on the as­cen­dancy af­ter mov­ing level with Tot­ten­ham, in fourth, on 29 points but with a game in hand.</p>
    <p>Should Pep Guardi­ola’s side win that home game against As­ton Villa on Jan 20, they will be right in the ti­tle hunt.</p>
    <p>De­spite strug­gling for goals this term, de­fen­sive sound­ness has kept City in the race but they had no is­sues cut­ting Chelsea to rib­bons with llkay Gun­do­gan, Phil Fo­den and Kevin de Bruyne net­ting, while still main­tain­ing their shape.</p>
    <p>Guardi­ola be­lieves his side are get­ting into their groove in time for a ti­tle push in the sec­ond half of the cam­paign.</p>
    <p>“The Premier League is weird for ev­ery­thing. Hope­fully, in the Premier League, in the last six, seven games we can be there fight­ing.</p>
    <p>“We have to play to our rhythm. The way we won the two Premier League ti­tles (in 2018 and 2019) was like to­day.”</p>
