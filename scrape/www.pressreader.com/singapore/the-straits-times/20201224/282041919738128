    <p>An­gered by a nurs­ing home res­i­dent who was throw­ing a tantrum, a male nurse as­saulted the 67-year-old man and caused him to be hos­pi­talised for seven days. Af­ter Flores Alvin Jay Var­gas, 36, kicked and threw punches at the wheelchair­bound res­i­dent, he told a nurs­ing aide not to re­veal what he had done. Yes­ter­day, the Philip­pines na­tional was jailed for 16 weeks af­ter he pleaded guilty to one count of as­sault.</p>
    <p>He is no longer work­ing at the All Saints Home in Jurong East.</p>
    <p>Deputy Pub­lic Prose­cu­tor (DPP) Ni­ran­jan Ran­jaku­nalan told the court the in­ci­dent had oc­curred at around 6pm on May 25 last year.</p>
    <p>The res­i­dent, who was left with brain trauma in­juries af­ter a 2017 traffic ac­ci­dent, had asked for a knife to cut an ap­ple.</p>
    <p>He threw a tantrum when his re­quest was turned down, said DPP Ni­ran­jan.</p>
    <p>The res­i­dent then re­peat­edly pressed the call bell next to his bed and Var­gas ap­proached him to ex­plain why staff could not pass him a knife.</p>
    <p>How­ever, the res­i­dent con­tin­ued press­ing dif­fer­ent call bells, and he pulled and tore Var­gas’ shirt while the nurse was at­tempt­ing to take a hand­held bell away from him, added the DPP.</p>
    <p>“The ac­cused be­came an­gry and punched the vic­tim – who was still on his bed – on his chest a few times. The ac­cused then kicked the frame of the vic­tim’s bed and kicked the vic­tim once on the right side of his body,” said DPP Ni­ran­jan. Other nurs­ing home staff who were present told Var­gas to stop. He later mes­saged one of the wit­nesses and told her not to tell oth­ers what he had done, the DPP added.</p>
    <p>The truth was un­cov­ered two days later when the vic­tim told his vis­it­ing brother about the in­ci­dent.</p>
    <p>The vic­tim was sent to Ng Teng Fong Gen­eral Hospi­tal where he was warded for seven days.</p>
    <p>Doc­tors found there was “sus­pi­cion of crack frac­tures” in the vic­tim’s ribs, although they could not con­firm if the frac­tures had oc­curred.</p>
    <p>In mit­i­ga­tion, Var­gas’ de­fence coun­sel said the nurse was deeply re­morse­ful.</p>
    <p>The sole bread­win­ner of his fam­ily, Var­gas told the court he had since been dis­missed by the nurs­ing home.</p>
    <p>Dis­trict Judge Jasven­der Kaur agreed with the pros­e­cu­tion’s sub­mis­sion that Var­gas should be given at least four months’ jail.</p>
    <p>She said pa­tients should be safe and cared for by nurses who keep their in­ter­ests at the “front and cen­tre”.</p>
    <p>This was not a case where there was a sin­gle punch that can be at­trib­uted to a mo­men­tary loss of anger, she added, high­light­ing that Var­gas had punched the vic­tims a few times and kicked him in anger.</p>
