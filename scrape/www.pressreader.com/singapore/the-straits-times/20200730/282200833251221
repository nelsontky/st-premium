    <p>A 29-year-old In­done­sian wo­man, who is be­lieved to have aban­doned her new­born baby, was ar­rested by the po­lice yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The baby boy was found out­side a semi-de­tached home in Tai Keng Gar­dens near Up­per Paya Le­bar Road on Mon­day night.</p>
    <p>He was then taken to KK Women’s and Chil­dren’s Hos­pi­tal.</p>
    <p>The po­lice said he had no vis­i­ble in­juries and his con­di­tion was sta­ble.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, the po­lice said in a state­ment that of­fi­cers from the Ang Mo Kio Po­lice Divi­sion were able to es­tab­lish the iden­tity of the wo­man through “ex­ten­sive ground in­ves­ti­ga­tions” and with the help of closed-cir­cuit tele­vi­sion footage from res­i­dents.</p>
    <p>The wo­man is ex­pected to be charged in court to­day with ex­po­sure and aban­don­ment of a child un­der 12 years old, un­der the Pe­nal Code.</p>
    <p>If con­victed, she may be jailed for up to seven years, fined, or both.</p>
    <p>“The po­lice would like to ex­press our ap­pre­ci­a­tion to the mem­bers of the com­mu­nity who pro­vided valu­able in­for­ma­tion which aided in­ves­ti­ga­tions and con­trib­uted to the ar­rest,” said the state­ment.</p>
    <p>On Tues­day, a res­i­dent who wanted to be known only as Mr Lew, told The Straits Times that his son-in-law dis­cov­ered the baby shortly af­ter a fam­ily din­ner.</p>
    <p>“He heard a strange noise com­ing from the re­cy­cling bin, and asked some of us for help to check it out,” said Mr Lew.</p>
    <p>“No one dared to open the bin be­cause they thought it might be a cat or a dog, so they called me for help.”</p>
    <p>As soon as Mr Lew lifted the lid of the bin, he knew it was not an animal but an in­fant who ap­peared to be new­born, wrapped in a towel</p>
    <p>BABY FOUND IN BIN</p>
    <p>No one dared to open the bin be­cause they thought it might be a cat or a dog, so they called me for help. ’’</p>
    <p>MR LEW, a res­i­dent of Tai Keng Gar­dens.</p>
    <p>and placed in pa­per bags.</p>
    <p>The fam­ily then called the po­lice. “We tried to carry it out us­ing the bags, but they were rip­ping apart at the bot­tom. So we tilted the bin, and car­ried him out,” he said.</p>
    <p>Mr Lew and his fam­ily then loos­ened the towel, which was cov­er­ing the baby’s face, to al­low him to breathe.</p>
    <p>“He was cry­ing loudly, so my wife started to con­sole him and he qui­etened a bit. Per­haps he knew that his life was saved.”</p>
    <p>Min­utes later, an am­bu­lance ar­rived to take the in­fant to the hos­pi­tal.</p>
    <p>Mr Lew said he was shaken from the dis­cov­ery, but re­lieved that the baby was alive and well.</p>
    <p>A spokesman for the Min­istry of So­cial and Fam­ily De­vel­op­ment said its Child Pro­tec­tive Ser­vice (CPS) is look­ing into im­me­di­ate care ar­range­ments for the child.</p>
    <p>Af­ter med­i­cal in­ves­ti­ga­tions, the child may be placed un­der the care of a foster par­ent reg­is­tered with the min­istry, while in­ves­ti­ga­tions are be­ing car­ried out.</p>
    <p>If the par­ents are traced, CPS will as­sess and rec­om­mend an ap­pro­pri­ate per­ma­nent care plan for the child.</p>
    <p>“In the event that the par­ents or ex­tended fam­ily of the child can­not be traced, or if they are as­sessed to be un­able or un­will­ing to pro­vide ap­pro­pri­ate care for the child, CPS ex­plores al­ter­na­tive care ar­range­ments, in­clud­ing adop­tion,” the spokesman said.</p>
    <p>In the past 10 years, at least 17 ba­bies were found aban­doned in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
