    <p>It is with great sad­ness that a self­less, ded­i­cated and unas­sum­ing phi­lan­thropist within the In­dian busi­ness fra­ter­nity was lost (Ko­mala Vi­las owner, known for phi­lan­thropy, dies at age 68, Dec 25).</p>
    <p>I per­son­ally knew Mr Ra­joo Gu­nasekaran dur­ing the last two decades of his life’s jour­ney, which had ups and downs.</p>
    <p>To many, he was a silent hero who did not em­brace pub­lic­ity. He ex­tended help to the un­der­priv­i­leged with­out any hes­i­ta­tion. He never turned down any­one who ap­proached him for as­sis­tance.</p>
    <p>I had the priv­i­lege of wit­ness­ing him help set up new busi­nesses and help many bud­ding busi­ness­men in ev­ery pos­si­ble man­ner.</p>
    <p>He did not like to be high­lighted or have his good deeds men­tioned.</p>
    <p>He al­ways told me: “God will bless good souls.” But I never imag­ined he would depart this world so soon.</p>
    <p>New busi­ness­men should em­u­late him. Apart from fo­cus­ing on and car­ing about their busi­nesses, they should give back to so­ci­ety in ev­ery small way.</p>
    <p>Mr Gu­nasekaran was gen­tle, cool and calm in his ap­proach to his cus­tomers.</p>
    <p>He ad­dressed cus­tomers by name, and I am sure he left a deep im­pres­sion on many of his cus­tomers with his greet­ings and smile.</p>
    <p>He was an un­sung hero who left a legacy in the restau­rant com­mu­nity.</p>
    <p>In Sin­ga­pore, many In­di­ans pa­tro­n­ise Ko­mala Vi­las</p>
    <p>Veg­e­tar­ian Restau­rant for its au­then­tic In­dian food and sweets.</p>
    <p>Mr Gu­nasekaran strongly ad­vo­cated that no child should be de­prived of for­mal ed­u­ca­tion. He would do his part wher­ever pos­si­ble for any child of any race.</p>
    <p>I hope that many of us will fol­low in his foot­steps, and his legacy should not and must not fade away.</p>
