    <p>Aries</p>
    <p>(March 21 - April 19)</p>
    <p>Take ad­van­tage of a big op­por­tu­nity – even if you did not see it first. Some­times you have to el­bow folks out of the way.</p>
    <p>Taurus</p>
    <p>(April 20 - May 20)</p>
    <p>You find it eas­ier to han­dle emo­tional busi­ness, as you are less prone to out­bursts and peo­ple can see the calm in your eyes.</p>
    <p>Gemini</p>
    <p>(May 21 - June 20)</p>
    <p>You feel held back in your deal­ings with other peo­ple, so see if you can get them to do their own thing while you gather your re­sources.</p>
    <p>Cancer</p>
    <p>(June 21 - July 22)</p>
    <p>Han­dle that one press­ing prob­lem or it is go­ing to get worse. Get help if you can, as it is get­ting more im­por­tant by the hour.</p>
    <p>Leo</p>
    <p>(July 23 - Aug 22)</p>
    <p>You are feel­ing bub­bly and ex­cited about some­thing – so share it with the world. Your harm­less en­thu­si­asm may net a few re­cruits.</p>
    <p>Virgo</p>
    <p>(Aug 23 - Sept 22)</p>
    <p>Ro­mance is in the air. Whether you need to ask out that one hot­tie or let your sweetie know where you stand, you can­not go wrong.</p>
    <p>Libra</p>
    <p>(Sept 23 - Oct 22)</p>
    <p>You feel down about some­thing, but this is not the time to cheer your­self up ar­ti­fi­cially. Be present and try to ex­pe­ri­ence th­ese feel­ings hon­estly.</p>
    <p>Scorpio</p>
    <p>(Oct 23 - Nov 21)</p>
    <p>Do you know what you re­ally want? Things are likely to get in­ter­est­ing once you have made up your mind, so get ready to act right away.</p>
    <p>Sagittariu­s</p>
    <p>(Nov 22 - Dec 21)</p>
    <p>Push your­self to tackle new things – your di­rect man­ner is sure to help. Peo­ple are more likely to help if you ask di­rectly be­fore get­ting started.</p>
    <p>Capricorn</p>
    <p>(Dec 22 - Jan 19)</p>
    <p>Expect good news, though it may come late. Some­thing is likely to have man­i­fested in just the way you wanted. Pop the cork and cel­e­brate.</p>
    <p>Aquarius</p>
    <p>(Jan 20 - Feb 18)</p>
    <p>You need to get back to ba­sics and keep a tighter rein on your mind. It is easy to get dis­tracted and lose touch with what’s most im­por­tant.</p>
    <p>Pisces</p>
    <p>(Feb 19 - March 20)</p>
    <p>Your clos­est co-work­ers are help­ful, even if you are job-hunt­ing or not at work. At least one will know what you need, so ask un­til you get it.</p>
