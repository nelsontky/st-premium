    <p>The Pasir Pan­jang Power Sta­tion and Capi­tol Theatre are set to hold con­certs and arts events with live au­di­ences, as Singapore moves cau­tiously to­wards al­low­ing largescale events that meet some re­quire­ments.</p>
    <p>Pasir Pan­jang Power Sta­tion will host two events this month.</p>
    <p>The first is a Christ­mas-themed con­cert, Flock – The Xmas Edi­tion, on Sun­day. It fea­tures home­grown acts Nathan Hartono, Aisyah Aziz and Lorong Boys in af­ter­noon and evening per­for­mances, with 400 tick­ets avail­able for each show.</p>
    <p>It is part of an on­go­ing pi­lot with manda­tory pre-event anti­gen rapid tests (ART) for at­ten­dees of large-scale indoor live per­for­mances. The tests are free at des­ig­nated clin­ics for au­di­ences.</p>
    <p>The sec­ond is an arts event, Con­vey, split into two ses­sions on Dec 27.</p>
    <p>Po­ets Char­lene Shep­herd­son, Crispin Ro­drigues, Mary­lyn Tan and Gwee Li Sui will cre­ate works live with il­lus­tra­tors Darel Seow and Weng Pixin. Fifty tick­ets are avail­able for each ses­sion and at­ten­dees need not take the ART test. Capi­tol Theatre will host a new con­cert se­ries next month and in Fe­bru­ary, fea­tur­ing Sin­ga­porean artists such as Jeremy Mon­teiro, Jimmy Ye and Art Fazil per­form­ing live in front of up to 100 au­di­ence mem­bers. The num­ber might be in­creased, pend­ing ap­proval from the Gov­ern­ment.</p>
    <p>The five-part se­ries, AL!VE, will take place on Jan 21 to 23 and Feb 5 and 6. The singers for this Sun­day’s Flock con­certs, which are sup­ported by the Singapore Tourism Board, are ex­cited to per­form for live au­di­ences again.</p>
    <p>The 2.30pm show will fea­ture per­for­mances by Hartono (left) and Aisyah, while the 8.30pm show will be head­lined by Hartono and Lorong Boys. Each set is ex­pected to last al­most two hours.</p>
    <p>Hartono says: “The au­di­ence is ir­re­place­able. I al­ways knew per­form­ing live is what I need and not just what I do.”</p>
    <p>For Aisyah, the year-end con­cert will make up for a year with­out live gigs. “I started off 2020 with kicka** per­for­mances. I thought the year was go­ing to be crazy good and then ev­ery­thing went into lock­down. The world has sent its mes­sage and I’ve come full cir­cle,” she says.</p>
    <p>Lorong Boys mem­ber Joachim Lim, who plays drums and per­cus­sion, says their set will fea­ture the mix of gen­res for which the group is known.</p>
    <p>“We’ve writ­ten and recorded new songs dur­ing the past few months. We will be mesh­ing clas­si­cal, jazz and pop with new ar­range­ments,” he says.</p>
    <p>The group also com­prises vi­o­lin­ist David Loke, pi­anist, guitarist and com­poser Jonathan Shin, and flautist Rit Xu.</p>
    <p>The pop con­cert in­dus­try here, bat­tered by re­stric­tions put in place due to Covid-19, is slowly start­ing to pick it­self up through shows with live au­di­ences.</p>
    <p>On Fri­day and Satur­day, Back To Live, a show by home-grown artists, is ex­pected to draw 500 mu­sic fans each night to the Sands Theatre at Ma­rina Bay Sands.</p>
    <p>In Con­vey, com­mis­sioned by the #BuySingLit read­ing cam­paign and sup­ported by the Na­tional Arts Coun­cil, writ­ers and artists will con­trib­ute to two col­lec­tive pieces, a poem and an art­work.</p>
    <p>Au­di­ences are en­cour­aged to not just watch, but also write their own po­ems or cre­ate their own sketches.</p>
    <p>The first ses­sion at 2pm will be about an hour and 35 min­utes long. The sec­ond ses­sion, which starts at 3.45pm, will run for about two hours and 25 min­utes.</p>
    <p>Shep­herd­son, gen­eral man­ager of non-profit or­gan­i­sa­tion Sing Lit Sta­tion, says: “I’m ex­cited to be in the same phys­i­cal space as other creatives to col­lab­o­rate on a penand-pa­per project again.”</p>
    <p>Seow, who has done il­lus­tra­tions for in­sti­tu­tions such as the Bri­tish Mu­seum in Lon­don, says: “It’s a beau­ti­ful ex­pres­sion of the con­nec­tive power of the arts as we weave pic­tures and words, bring­ing peo­ple to­gether both in-per­son and on-screen.”</p>
    <p>Au­di­ences at both events, or­gan­ised by event pro­moter 24Owls, can be seated in groups of up to five, but no in­ter­min­gling among groups or sin­gle-ticket hold­ers is al­lowed.</p>
    <p>They must be masked and must check in us­ing the TraceTo­gether (Above) Singapore singer Aisyah Aziz.</p>
    <p>(From far left) David Loke, Rit Xu, Joachim Lim and Jonathan Shin make up lo­cal mu­sic group Lorong Boys. app or to­ken. Those who are un­well will not be al­lowed into the venue.</p>
    <p>For the AL!VE se­ries at Capi­tol Theatre, the first con­cert on Jan 21 will fea­ture singers Art, Hyrul Anuar, Rahila Rashun and club cir­cuit vet­er­ans Jive Talkin’.</p>
    <p>The Jan 22 show will fea­ture jazz mu­si­cians and singers Mon­teiro, Louis So­liano, Ale­may Fer­nan­dez, Melissa Tham and Siti Iman.</p>
    <p>The show on Jan 23 is a solo con­cert by Joi Chua.</p>
    <p>The Feb 5 show will fea­ture singers Sher­man Zhuo, Tien Chong, Re­lyne Ban, Wil­son Huang, Cherelle Tan and Mar­cus Lee. Singer Ye will stage a solo con­cert for the se­ries’ last show on Feb 6.</p>
    <p>The au­di­ence will have to ad­here to safe dis­tanc­ing mea­sures, but will not have to go for pre-event test­ing.</p>
