    <p>Grow­ing up in a three-room flat in Be­dok North, life was not al­ways easy for Mr Mo­hamed Faizal Mo­hamed Ab­dul Kadir, as fi­nances were tight for his par­ents.</p>
    <p>But his par­ents – a housewife and a taxi driver – did all they could to give back de­spite their own cir­cum­stances.</p>
    <p>They, for one, pro­vided home­cooked food to mosques, which is what has in­spired Mr Faizal, 40, to al­ways do the same even as he now serves as a deputy chief pros­e­cu­tor and se­nior state coun­sel at the At­tor­ney-Gen­eral’s Cham­bers.</p>
    <p>Mr Faizal re­ceived the Berita Har­ian Anugerah Jauhari 2020, or</p>
    <p>Achiever of the Year award, from Law and Home Af­fairs Min­is­ter K. Shan­mugam yes­ter­day for his out­stand­ing achieve­ments in the le­gal pro­fes­sion, as well as for his con­tri­bu­tions to com­mu­nity causes. He was ap­pointed a se­nior coun­sel ear­lier this year, and is the first Malay/ Mus­lim to be given the ti­tle.</p>
    <p>The BH award is just the lat­est in ac­co­lades that Mr Faizal has re­ceived. In 2015, he won the Pres­i­dent’s Award for Youth and he was also in­ducted as a Young Global Leader by the World Eco­nomic Fo­rum in 2016.</p>
    <p>In the three years since then, he was named as one of the 500 Most</p>
    <p>In­flu­en­tial Mus­lims in the World – a list com­piled by the Royal Is­lamic Strate­gic Stud­ies Cen­tre in Jor­dan.</p>
    <p>De­spite his many achieve­ments, Mr Faizal cuts a hum­ble fig­ure, and cred­its his suc­cess to the con­tri­bu­tions of oth­ers, in ad­di­tion to hard work. He said: “My jour­ney and the story of my pro­fes­sional ca­reer isn’t mine alone. It is the story of love, hard work, sup­port, men­tor­ship and guid­ance by so many around me, both per­son­ally and pro­fes­sion­ally.”</p>
    <p>He cur­rently funds schol­ar­ship pro­grammes at his alma maters, Be­dok View Sec­ondary School and Tampines Ju­nior Col­lege, for needy</p>
    <p>stu­dents who show prom­ise and have per­formed well aca­dem­i­cally.</p>
    <p>He has also con­trib­uted to com­mu­nity self-help group Men­daki since 2005, by be­ing in­volved in its Young Men­daki Club, which pro­vides Malay/Mus­lim sec­ondary school stu­dents op­por­tu­ni­ties to hone their so­cial and lead­er­ship skills, as well as struc­tured work­shops that help them de­velop into well-rounded in­di­vid­u­als.</p>
    <p>Berita Har­ian ed­i­tor Mohd Saat Ab­dul Rah­man said: “Com­ing from a hum­ble back­ground, his achieve­ments make him an ex­cel­lent role model – not only for the Malay/ Mus­lim com­mu­nity but also for all Sin­ga­pore­ans.”</p>
    <p>The Malay-lan­guage news­pa­per’s an­nual award, which was started in 1998, is pre­sented an­nu­ally to out­stand­ing Malay/Mus­lim in­di­vid­u­als for their achieve­ments in var­i­ous fields.</p>
    <p>The award was last given to Imam Syed Has­san Mo­hamed Al</p>
    <p>At­tas, the head of Ba’al­wie Mosque in Lewis Road, in recog­ni­tion of his con­tri­bu­tions to in­ter­faith work. Pres­i­dent Hal­imah Ya­cob and mas­ter pot­ter Iskan­dar Jalil are among past re­cip­i­ents of the award, now in its 22nd year.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, Berita Har­ian also awarded na­tional team foot­baller Ikhsan Fandi, 21, who is cur­rently play­ing for Nor­we­gian First Di­vi­sion club Jerv, its Young Achiever of the Year.</p>
    <p>In his speech, Mr Shan­mugam con­grat­u­lated both win­ners and told foot­ball leg­end Fandi Ah­mad that he hopes Mr Ikhsan will be suc­cess­ful just like his fa­ther. “Ikhsan is fly­ing our flag very high, in a dif­fer­ent part of the world. My sin­cere wish for Ikhsan, and a sum­mary of ev­ery­thing I want to say about him, is that while many now know him as Fandi’s son, I hope one day, Fandi will be known as Ikhsan’s fa­ther,” the min­is­ter said.
