    <p>“To­gether with other lo­gis­tic and sup­ply chain play­ers, they have</p>
    <p>A per­ma­nent space for large-scale events that will also pay trib­ute to Sin­ga­pore’s na­tional ser­vice­men will take the place of the pop­u­lar Ma­rina Bay float­ing plat­form and will be the cen­tral fo­cus of the new down­town area, said Prime Min­is­ter Lee Hsien Loong in his Na­tional Day mes­sage yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The up­com­ing NS Square, due to be com­pleted by end-2025, will con­tinue to host fu­ture Na­tional Day Pa­rades, said PM Lee in his tele­vised Na­tional Day mes­sage be­fore this year’s pa­rade at the Padang, a smaller-scale event held in the midst of the Covid-19 pan­demic.</p>
    <p>PM Lee yes­ter­day un­veiled the NS Square’s de­sign for the first time. Its grand­stand seat­ing can hold up to 30,000 peo­ple, com­pared with the cur­rent ca­pac­ity of 27,000 at The Float @ Ma­rina Bay.</p>
    <p>There will be a gallery, with a mix of open and en­closed spa­ces, to hon­our the con­tri­bu­tions of na­tional ser­vice­men past and present.</p>
    <p>It will also fea­ture com­mu­nity sports fa­cil­i­ties, such as a swim­ming pool and wa­ter sports cen­tre, as well as a new wa­ter­front prom­e­nade that helped to keep our sup­ply chains go­ing, pro­vid­ing us with food and es­sen­tial ser­vices and items.”</p>
    <p>Trans­port Min­is­ter Ong Ye Kung, who vis­ited Changi Air­port’s air con­trol tower and spoke to staff, said “air traf­fic may be low, but spir­its are high”.</p>
    <p>“We spent more than 40 years build­ing up Sin­ga­pore as an air hub, and Covid-19 dec­i­mated avi­a­tion... will im­prove pedes­trian con­nec­tiv­ity in the area, form­ing a loop around Ma­rina Bay.</p>
    <p>NS Square will also be a com­mu­nity space for ev­ery­one, young and old, to en­joy, he said.</p>
    <p>“The plat­form will be­come a red dot, shin­ing bright in our city. NS Square will be the cen­tral fo­cus of our new down­town,” said PM Lee.</p>
    <p>“And of course, we will con­tinue to hold our Na­tional Day Pa­rades there,” he added.</p>
    <p>Last month, the Min­istry of Na­tional De­vel­op­ment (MND) and the Min­istry of De­fence (Mindef) jointly an­nounced that the NS Square pro­ject had been awarded to a con­sul­tant team led by Woha Ar­chi­tects.</p>
    <p>The Sin­ga­pore-based firm was se­lected to act as the prin­ci­pal con­sul­tant fol­low­ing a de­sign con­sul­tancy ten­der held from May last year to July this year.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, the two min­istries said that a tiered, curved seat­ing area will wrap around the stage “to pro­vide an un­in­ter­rupted line-of-sight to the stage from all an­gles as well as bring spec­ta­tors closer to the ‘ac­tion’ ”.</p>
    <p>Other than NDP, the space could also be con­fig­ured for events of dif­fer­ent scales and types, such as con</p>
    <p>We hope that in the months, weeks ahead, we will start the process of re­gain­ing and re­viv­ing our air hub sta­tus,” he told re­porters.</p>
    <p>At the Na­tional Cen­tre for In­fec­tious Dis­eases, a crit­i­cal fa­cil­ity in Sin­ga­pore’s Covid-19 fight, Health Min­is­ter Gan Kim Yong thanked health­care work­ers.</p>
    <p>“The road to re­cov­ery will be long and tough. But I am con­fi­dent the certs, per­for­mances, sport­ing ac­tiv­i­ties and com­pe­ti­tions, they said.</p>
    <p>A lower prom­e­nade area will be open all year round, with sup­port­ing food and bev­er­age out­lets and re­tail out­lets be­ing con­sid­ered for the new de­vel­op­ment.</p>
    <p>Re­de­vel­op­ment work is sched­uled to start in March 2022, although the pro­ject scope and time­line may be ad­justed due to the im­pact of Covid-19.</p>
    <p>Ini­tially built as a tem­po­rary Na­tional Day Pa­rade venue while the new Na­tional Sta­dium was un­der con­struc­tion, The Float @ Ma­rina Bay has hosted the event nine times since 2007, and was due to do so this year, be­fore the coro­n­avirus out­break made it un­fea­si­ble.</p>
    <p>In 2017 – the 50th year of na­tional ser­vice in Sin­ga­pore – PM Lee an­nounced that the float­ing plat­form would be re­de­vel­oped into a per­ma­nent space.</p>
    <p>He noted that na­tional ser­vice re­cruits cur­rently hold their pass­ing out pa­rade at the float­ing plat­form, and this helps them to un­der­stand what they are de­fend­ing, and why gen­er­a­tions of na­tional ser­vice­men have been will­ing to serve and sac­ri­fice.</p>
    <p>PM Lee said: “Every Na­tional Day,</p>
    <p>Covid-19 virus will not break our Sin­ga­pore spirit of grit, re­silience, de­ter­mi­na­tion and unity,” he said.</p>
    <p>At the En­abling Vil­lage, So­cial and Fam­ily De­vel­op­ment Min­is­ter Masa­gos Zulk­i­fli said the venue for per­sons with dis­abil­i­ties rep­re­sented “the ethos of our so­cial ser­vices sec­tor” where ben­e­fi­cia­ries are al­ways placed at the cen­tre.</p>
    <p>He added that he was heart­ened we re­mind our­selves that Sin­ga­pore is a na­tion whose story is worth cel­e­brat­ing, whose his­tory is worth cher­ish­ing, and whose fu­ture is worth build­ing.”</p>
    <p>When the NDP is held at the Padang, or at the float­ing plat­form, the au­di­ence can see the Ma­rina Bay sky­line in the back­ground, he said.</p>
    <p>Ma­rina Bay used to be open sea, but the land around it was re­claimed, and it was turned into a reser­voir.</p>
    <p>“Look­ing out across the Bay, you can im­me­di­ately see how far Sin­ga­pore has come, and imag­ine the pos­si­bil­ity and prom­ise that Sin­ga­pore holds,” he added.</p>
    <p>MND and Mindef said the de­vel­op­ment will take ad­van­tage of the site’s wa­ter­front lo­ca­tion, and will al­low ac­tiv­i­ties such as dragon boat­ing, ca­noe­ing and kayak­ing, in ad­di­tion to hav­ing a swim­ming pool and wa­ter play ar­eas open to the public.</p>
    <p>“(The wa­ter sports) fa­cil­ity, part of a larger net­work of wa­ter sports fa­cil­i­ties around Ma­rina Reser­voir, will pro­vide the com­mu­nity with greater ac­cess to wa­ter-based re­cre­ational op­tions in cen­tral Sin­ga­pore,” added the min­istries. by how peo­ple have stepped for­ward to help the vul­ner­a­ble and sup­port front-line and mi­grant work­ers.</p>
    <p>“Cri­sis of­ten brings out the best in us. Even as this pan­demic has caused ma­jor dis­rup­tions to our lives, I am glad that the com­mu­nity has stepped up to sup­port our fel­low Sin­ga­pore­ans.”</p>
    <p>At the Life­long Learn­ing In­sti­tute in Paya Le­bar, lead­ers from busi­ness, the labour move­ment and the Govern­ment rep­re­sented Sin­ga­pore’s unique tri­par­tite re­la­tion­ship sup­port­ing its work­force.</p>
    <p>Man­power Min­is­ter Josephine Teo said there was still much to be grate­ful for, in­clud­ing Sin­ga­pore’s low Covid-19 fa­tal­i­ties and the re­silience of Sin­ga­pore’s peo­ple, busi­nesses and civil ser­vice.</p>
    <p>Speak­ing to re­porters af­ter the event, Mrs Teo said Sin­ga­pore’s di­verse work­force will con­tinue to face chal­lenges, but she is con­fi­dent of its abil­ity to weather the cri­sis.</p>
    <p>She noted that younger work­ers are will­ing to adapt to the labour mar­ket and are cre­ative in con­tribut­ing to the work­force dig­i­tally.</p>
    <p>For mid­dle-aged work­ers, the fo­cus is on help­ing avoid per­ma­nent dam­age to ca­reers based on cur­rent tem­po­rary set­backs, she said.</p>
    <p>Re­flect­ing on the past few months, in­clud­ing re­cent in­roads in the Covid-19 sit­u­a­tion at the mi­grant work­ers’ dor­mi­to­ries, Mrs Teo said “every small win” is cel­e­brated dur­ing such a dif­fi­cult jour­ney, while stay­ing vig­i­lant against un­ex­pected chal­lenges.</p>
    <p>“Our abil­ity to quickly as­sess the sit­u­a­tion and or­gan­ise our­selves in or­der to mount as best a re­sponse as we can – that must re­main part of the Sin­ga­pore DNA,” she said.</p>
