    <p>For a beloved co­me­dian who can eas­ily pack a room, Ku­mar has found him­self sur­pris­ingly wellad­justed to the in­tro­vert life.</p>
    <p>With his fin­gers laced neatly across his lap, the na­tional icon tells The Sun­day Times he en­joyed the cir­cuit breaker.</p>
    <p>He had more time with his two dogs – Oreo the Scot­tish ter­rier and Cookie the maltipoo – and was pro­duc­tive at home.</p>
    <p>Even in phase two, he is not go­ing out much.</p>
    <p>“But now it’s hit me, I’m very bored. Go­ing out is hor­ri­ble be­cause you have to go back by 10.30pm (when liquor sales and con­sump­tion have to cease), so I stay home and ‘cir­cuit breaker’ my­self.”</p>
    <p>And it will mostly be a quiet birthday spent at home with his dogs when the co­me­dian, born Ku­mara­son Chin­nadu­rai, turns 52 to­mor­row.</p>
    <p>But in the evening, he will host a vir­tual talk show on the Sin­ga­pore Cancer So­ci­ety’s (SCS) Face­book page. View­ers can tune in to the 15-minute live pre­miere event at 9pm, which in­cludes a vir­tual do­na­tion drive for the so­ci­ety.</p>
    <p>While it is the first time he is openly as­so­ci­at­ing with the so­ci­ety – this in­ter­view was done at the SCS Re­ha­bil­i­ta­tion Cen­tre in Jurong – it says Ku­mar has been dis­creetly help­ing the cancer com­mu­nity for years.</p>
    <p>Un­known to most Sin­ga­pore­ans, the mas­ter of dry wit lost a loved one to cancer.</p>
    <p>In 2009, his fa­ther was di­ag­nosed with stage 4 lym­phoma. It came as no shock to Ku­mar and his fam­ily, who had seen the di­ag­no­sis com­ing from a mile away.</p>
    <p>His fa­ther had been suf­fer­ing for a long time, dis­play­ing “symp­toms” that tipped them off, Ku­mar re­calls.</p>
    <p>“We knew he was go­ing, you could tell – he was just ly­ing there, in pain and shout­ing.</p>
    <p>He adds drolly: “One day, when some­one in your life passes on, you’ll look back and re­alise ‘eh, Ku­mar was right’.”</p>
    <p>They watched Mr Chin­nadu­rai de­te­ri­o­rate, but could do noth­ing.</p>
    <p>“The older gen­er­a­tion, they refuse to seek help. My fa­ther was very stub­born and re­fused to go for any check-ups,” Ku­mar says. “I just knew he was go­ing down­hill. And I didn’t know how to help him.”</p>
    <p>Even­tu­ally, Ku­mar’s el­der sis­ter con­vinced him to go to the hospi­tal. “But it was too late,” he says.</p>
    <p>Mr Chin­nadu­rai died at age 77, 16 days later.</p>
    <p>The slow burn of his ill­ness had pre­pared the fam­ily for his death, Ku­mar says. “If I could un­plug the life sup­port, I would have. I’d rather he go than he suf­fer.”</p>
    <p>That was 11 years ago. His fa­ther passed while they were on good terms, but grow­ing up, fa­ther and son were not close.</p>
    <p>Ku­mar’s par­ents di­vorced when he was four and, ow­ing to In­dian su­per­sti­tion, he was blamed for it.</p>
    <p>“In­di­ans be­lieve that if a boy is born in the month of Au­gust, it’s bad luck. It’s all just su­per­sti­tion, but they needed to blame some­one, right?”</p>
    <p>His fa­ther, a care­taker for the So­ci­ety for the Preven­tion of Cru­elty to An­i­mals, was ab­sent for much of his child­hood. Ku­mar, his three older sis­ters and younger brother were raised by his mother’s sis­ter, a po­lice­woman.</p>
    <p>His dad’s dis­ap­proval of his ca­reer did not help.</p>
    <p>“He didn’t speak to me be­cause I was do­ing stand-up com­edy in drag,” he says. “My fa­ther thought I was a pros­ti­tute, that I was not the right kind of child.”</p>
    <p>They re­con­nected in his adult­hood. Ku­mar re­calls one Deep­avali, years ago, when his fa­ther came up to him and of­fered an olive branch – sort of.</p>
    <p>“He said, ‘You’re go­ing to be alone for the rest of your life, so bet­ter save money.’ That meant ac­cept­ing the fact that I was dif­fer­ent,” Ku­mar says with a shrug.</p>
    <p>From then on, their com­mu­ni­ca­tion im­proved – iron­i­cally, as his fa­ther barely spoke English and him, Tamil. “Like chicken and duck talk­ing,” Ku­mar says.</p>
    <p>He vis­ited the el­derly man every Sun­day and bought him meals he was crav­ing.</p>
    <p>Grow­ing closer to his fa­ther in his fi­nal years gave Ku­mar the clo­sure he needed. “I was there as a child for him through­out his suf­fer­ing. I did what I can… and I think there’s clo­sure.”</p>
    <p>LIFE LESSONS FROM THE PAN­DEMIC</p>
    <p>The ex­pe­ri­ence has shaped Ku­mar’s de­sire to give back to and help the cancer com­mu­nity.</p>
    <p>While the birthday do­na­tion drive will sup­port cancer pa­tients and their fam­i­lies, he mainly wants to stress the im­por­tance of early screen­ing.</p>
    <p>“Peo­ple should stop think­ing of cancer as a death sen­tence be­cause it’s not. There’s a lot of help now. My birthday wish is for peo­ple to un­der­stand that – and if you’re sick, to go for early test­ing.”</p>
    <p>Life at home dur­ing the pan­demic has given him time to re­flect and fo­cus on causes he cares about.</p>
    <p>To­gether with a few other celebri­ties from Me­di­a­corp’s Vas­an­tham chan­nel, he has been host­ing weekly live streams on a Face­book com­mu­nity page called It’s ok 2 Be not OKAY, which sup­ports In­di­ans with de­pres­sion.</p>
    <p>In­di­ans “can­not lose face” and de­pres­sion is stig­ma­tised, says Ku­mar, so the live streams give them an out­let they can tune in to with­out be­ing judged.</p>
    <p>He has also been ob­serv­ing his so­cial cir­cles and keep­ing tabs on the news – to col­lect new ma­te­rial for his com­edy gigs at night­club Can­vas and Cen­tral Perk Cafe when they can safely re­sume.</p>
    <p>All it takes is a lit­tle prob­ing for the fun­ny­man, who made his name at the now-de­funct cabaret club Boom Boom Room in the 1990s, to share some choice ob­ser­va­tions of the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Flit­ting deftly be­tween snarky and se­ri­ous, he points out bluntly that a lot of mar­riages did not work be­cause peo­ple were forced to stay home and “bond”. Par­ents had to deal with “ir­ri­tat­ing kids run­ning around” dur­ing Zoom meet­ings and moth­ers were “shout­ing at the helper”.</p>
    <p>Then there were the il­le­gal gath­er­ings, he notes with a gig­gle: “All the for­eign­ers got de­ported, lost their (liveli­hoods) just be­cause they had a glass of beer out­side.”</p>
    <p>And, of course, he does not shy away from prickly so­cial is­sues – the bread and but­ter of his acts.</p>
    <p>“Racism is back,” he de­clares. “It’s back in many ways.”</p>
    <p>On a more se­ri­ous note, the re­cent dis­cus­sions about race on so­cial me­dia have shown how ig­no­rant many still are, he says.</p>
    <p>A lot of it “comes from the home”. He re­calls how a friend’s child shared an in­stance where a class­mate at a tuition cen­tre said to him, “You’re so black, go and die”.</p>
    <p>“Racial har­mony in schools is not enough. It can’t be (ob­served only on) one day of the year – it has to be every day,” he says, re­fer­ring to Racial Har­mony Day, which falls on July 21.</p>
    <p>“It can’t just be that on July 21, every­body comes to school and eats In­dian food, Chi­nese food, Malay food – okay, we’re done.”</p>
    <p>And text­books fea­tur­ing In­di­ans with names like “Muthu or Ravi” will not cut it, he adds. Ed­u­ca­tion should start at home.</p>
    <p>Stay­ing in might seem dull now, but it has taught him the im­por­tance of slow­ing down. Be­fore, ev­ery­one was “liv­ing for so­ci­ety”. As a re­sult of peer pres­sure, they were con­sumed with ma­te­rial goods and check­ing off mile­stones like get­ting mar­ried or buy­ing a car, he adds.</p>
    <p>“A lot of peo­ple were not com­fort­able with them­selves, so they would go to the of­fice to hang out with col­leagues, to fit in.”</p>
    <p>But now, they have to con­front their demons alone and the re­sults have been re­ward­ing, he says.</p>
    <p>He has no­ticed that peo­ple have be­come “nicer”.</p>
    <p>“This pan­demic is a les­son for ev­ery­one to wake up. There is no need to fit into so­ci­ety. Once you’re happy with your­self, you can be happy with other peo­ple.”</p>
    <p>“And be more kind lah,” he adds. “If some­one is not wear­ing a mask, just tell them – don’t take photo and post. Don’t sabo.”</p>
