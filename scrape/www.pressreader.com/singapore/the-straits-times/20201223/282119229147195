    <p>More than 95,000 em­ploy­ers re­ceived over $1 bil­lion in pay­outs un­der the Wage Credit Scheme (WCS) this year to help them fund the wage in­creases of their Sin­ga­porean em­ploy­ees.</p>
    <p>The next tranche of pay­outs will take place in March next year, said the Min­istry of Fi­nance and In­land Rev­enue Au­thor­ity of Sin­ga­pore (Iras) in a state­ment yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Em­ploy­ers do not need to ap­ply for WCS pay­outs. Those who are el­i­gi­ble will be no­ti­fied by endMarch on the amount they will re­ceive.</p>
    <p>To qual­ify for the eighth tranche of pay­outs, em­ploy­ers must have raised the gross monthly wages of their Sin­ga­porean em­ploy­ees by at least $50 this year, or main­tained the pre­vi­ous wage in­crease of at least $50 given in 2017, 2018 and/or 2019, or done both these things.</p>
    <p>Em­ploy­ers must also pay the manda­tory Cen­tral Prov­i­dent Fund (CPF) con­tri­bu­tions for this year’s staff wages to the CPF Board by Jan 14.</p>
    <p>The pay­outs will be cred­ited di­rectly to em­ploy­ers’ bank ac­counts through PayNow Cor­po­rate or Giro.</p>
    <p>Iras and the Fi­nance Min­istry re­minded em­ploy­ers to set up a PayNow Cor­po­rate ac­count or reg­is­ter for Giro by the end of Fe­bru­ary, if they have not al­ready done so.</p>
    <p>The WCS has been in place since 2013 to help busi­nesses em­bark on their trans­for­ma­tion ef­forts and to en­cour­age them to share their pro­duc­tiv­ity gains with work­ers.</p>
    <p>This year, there were two rounds of WCS pay­outs. In ad­di­tion to the main pay­out in March, em­ploy­ers re­ceived a sec­ond round of pay­outs in June as part of the $6.4 bil­lion Unity Budget to com­bat Covid-19.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing the Budget 2020 speech, the scheme’s gross monthly wage ceil­ing was raised from $4,000 to $5,000 per month for 2019 and 2020 qual­i­fy­ing wage in­creases.</p>
    <p>The Gov­ern­ment also an­nounced that its co-fund­ing lev­els for the 2019 and 2020 qual­i­fy­ing wage in­creases will be raised from 15 per cent and 10 per cent, to 20 per cent and 15 per cent, re­spec­tively.</p>
    <p>For more in­for­ma­tion on the scheme, em­ploy­ers can visit the Iras web­site or call its hot­line on 1800-352-4727.</p>
