    <p>PARIS • French Pres­i­dent Em­manuel Macron’s rul­ing party has agreed to re­write a draft plan that would have curbed the free­dom to share im­ages iden­ti­fy­ing po­lice of­fi­cers, af­ter large protests over the week­end against po­lice vi­o­lence.</p>
    <p>More than 133,000 peo­ple, in­clud­ing 46,000 in Paris, ral­lied last Satur­day against the draft Bill and in favour of free speech.</p>
    <p>The ral­lies fol­lowed the pub­li­ca­tion of video footage of a black man be­ing beaten up last month by three po­lice of­fi­cers in­side his own mu­sic stu­dio. Pres­i­dent Macron has branded the in­ci­dent “shame­ful” for France.</p>
    <p>A pro­vi­sion in the Bill known as Ar­ti­cle 24, a key plank in Mr Macron’s plans to court right-wing vot­ers by be­ing tougher on law and or­der ahead of his 2022 re-elec­tion bid, had sparked out­rage in the me­dia and on the left of his own party.</p>
    <p>“We pro­pose a new ver­sion of Ar­ti­cle 24 and a new ver­sion will be sub­mit­ted,” Mr Christophe Cas­taner, head of Mr Macron’s Repub­lic on the Move party in the Lower House of Par­lia­ment, told a news con­fer­ence on Mon­day.</p>
    <p>Ar­ti­cle 24 did not ban out­right the shar­ing of im­ages of the po­lice, but made it a crime – pun­ish­able by a year in prison and a €45,000 (S$72,200) fine – to share them with an “ob­vi­ous in­ten­tion to harm”.</p>
    <p>French jour­nal­ists and the gov­ern­ment’s own in­de­pen­dent om­buds­man on hu­man rights said the Ar­ti­cle was too vague and could have a chill­ing ef­fect on peo­ple want­ing to ex­pose po­lice bru­tal­ity.</p>
    <p>The footage show­ing the vi­o­lent ar­rest of Mr Michel Ze­cler in his stu­dio, which prompted global crit­i­cism, made it even less ten­able for Mr Macron to press on with Ar­ti­cle 24, French of­fi­cials said.</p>
    <p>The four po­lice of­fi­cers in­volved in the beat­ing, who have been sus­pended, were placed un­der for­mal in­ves­ti­ga­tion late on Sun­day and charged with as­sault, in­clud­ing the use of a weapon, a French ju­di­cial of­fi­cial said on Mon­day.</p>
    <p>Some were also charged with the use of racial in­sults.</p>
    <p>“We ac­knowl­edge that there are doubts, that some peo­ple con­sider that the right to in­form is un­der threat... That is why it is nec­es­sary to clar­ify it,” Mr Cas­taner said.</p>
    <p>His state­ment came af­ter Mr Macron held an emer­gency meet­ing on the Bill at the El­y­see Palace on Mon­day with lead­ers of his par­lia­men­tary ma­jor­ity and his toughtalk­ing In­te­rior Min­is­ter Ger­ald Dar­manin, a for­mer con­ser­va­tive.</p>
    <p>Many of Mr Macron’s more cen­tre-left fol­low­ers have ex­pressed dis­may at what they see as the Pres­i­dent’s “con­ser­va­tive turn” in re­cent months.</p>
    <p>The stated aim of the broader “gen­eral se­cu­rity” Bill is to pro­vide bet­ter pro­tec­tion for French po­lice of­fi­cers, whose unions said were un­der heavy strain af­ter months of vi­o­lent “yel­low vest” protests.</p>
    <p>A com­pletely new ver­sion of Ar­ti­cle 24 will be sub­mit­ted at a later date, of­fi­cials said, although it re­mained un­clear when, since the Bill, ap­proved last week by the Lower House, has been sent to the Up­per House, where the con­ser­va­tives, and not Mr Macron’s party, have a ma­jor­ity.</p>
