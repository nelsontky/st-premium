    <p>Hong Kong me­dia ty­coon and pro-democ­racy ac­tivist Jimmy Lai said he was touched by Hong Kong res­i­dents who have sup­ported free­dom of the press by buy­ing up copies of the pop­u­lar pro-democ­racy news­pa­per and shares of his me­dia com­pany, which boosted the stock price by as much as 1,100 per cent. WORLD</p>
    <p>HONG KONG • Hong Kong me­dia ty­coon and pro-democ­racy ac­tivist Jimmy Lai said his ar­rest ear­lier this week took him by sur­prise and that he has been over­whelmed by res­i­dents’ sup­port de­spite the threat from China’s new na­tional se­cu­rity law.</p>
    <p>“I didn’t ex­pect an ar­rest as quick as this be­cause I thought that China, with such a strong re­sponse from the in­ter­na­tional com­mu­nity, knew that the im­ple­men­ta­tion of the na­tional se­cu­rity law was a blun­der,” he said in a live-streamed con­ver­sa­tion hosted yesterday by his flag­ship Ap­ple Daily tabloid.</p>
    <p>“I thought they would keep a low pro­file to make sure that the in­ter­na­tional com­mu­nity is com­fort­able with it, the in­vestors, the busi­ness­men – to tell the world that the na­tional se­cu­rity law ac­tu­ally now has calmed every­thing down.”</p>
    <p>Lai said he was touched by Hong Kong res­i­dents who have sup­ported free­dom of the press by this week buy­ing up both copies of the pop­u­lar pro-democ­racy news­pa­per and shares of his me­dia com­pany, Next Dig­i­tal, which boosted the stock price by as much as 1,100 per cent.</p>
    <p>“I was re­ally over­whelmed by the emo­tion of the city – peo­ple were ob­vi­ously very an­gry about my ar­rest and came out in dif­fer­ent ways to sup­port us,” he said.</p>
    <p>Lai’s ar­rest is the highest-pro­file de­ten­tion in Hong Kong un­der the na­tional se­cu­rity law, im­posed on the city by China in June. It so far has been used to ar­rest 21 peo­ple.</p>
    <p>Some 200 po­lice of­fi­cers on Mon­day raided the head­quar­ters of the Ap­ple Daily, which sup­ported Hong Kong’s his­toric protest move­ment last year. Scenes of of­fi­cers walk­ing through the news­room shocked a city where free­dom of the press has long been guar­an­teed, and which is home to many global me­dia or­gan­i­sa­tions.</p>
    <p>The ar­rest stands to ex­ac­er­bate al­ready-fraught US-China ten­sions. The Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion this month slapped sanc­tions on Hong Kong leader Car­rie Lam and moved to ban China’s pop­u­lar WeChat and TikTok apps from the United States.</p>
    <p>Bei­jing re­tal­i­ated with sanc­tions on some US of­fi­cials and hu­man rights ac­tivists. US Sec­re­tary of State Michael Pom­peo this week, vowed to hit back over Lai’s ar­rest.</p>
    <p>Lai yesterday said that, for the mo­ment, he is not afraid of be­ing spir­ited away to the main­land for a trial in courts con­trolled by the Com­mu­nist Party. He said that could change if Bei­jing is con­vinced that he has se­ri­ously en­dan­gered na­tional se­cu­rity.</p>
    <p>But the ac­tivist also made con­cil­ia­tory re­marks, ar­gu­ing that the world should be friendly to­wards China. He said the West’s con­fronta­tion with Bei­jing was a re­sult of Chi­nese lead­ers pur­su­ing an agenda that was in con­flict with global norms, and that the world would not have peace un­til China changed its be­hav­iour.</p>
    <p>“The world doesn’t want to con­front China be­cause they’re so big – con­fronta­tion ev­ery time with China will have such a neg­a­tive im­pact on the world,” Lai said.</p>
    <p>“The world just wants to change China’s be­hav­iour, and at­ti­tude to­wards the in­ter­na­tional com­mu­nity, be­cause they’re us­ing the kind of values that are in con­flict with the world’s civilised values. If we don’t change them, the world will not have peace. And that’s why to­day peo­ple are talk­ing about the ‘new Cold War’.”</p>
