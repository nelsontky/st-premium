    <p>The Cabi­net that Prime Min­is­ter Lee Hsien Loong an­nounced last Satur­day seeks to bal­ance con­ti­nu­ity, pro­vided by his se­nior col­leagues; ex­po­sure for younger min­is­ters through a change of port­fo­lios for some; and lead­er­ship re­newal. Change is pal­pa­ble in that six of the 15 min­istries will see a change in the min­is­ter at the helm. Also, seven new Peo­ple’s Ac­tion Party MPs have been ap­pointed po­lit­i­cal of­fice-hold­ers, with the old­est among them made a full min­is­ter. Sev­eral older min­is­ters, in­clud­ing Se­nior Min­is­ters Teo Chee Hean and Thar­man Shan­mu­garat­nam, are stay­ing on to pro­vide con­ti­nu­ity.</p>
    <p>This is to be ex­pected. A ma­jor change mid­stream in the com­po­si­tion of the team help­ing to steady the ship of state, while head­winds from the coro­n­avirus pan­demic rav­age na­tional life, would hardly have en­abled the coun­try to nav­i­gate the waters.</p>
    <p>Nor would it have been wise to have changed the crew who have been man­ag­ing crit­i­cal sec­tors such as fi­nance and the econ­omy, trade and man­power. In­stead, the di­ver­sity of young and old, along with some ro­ta­tion of port­fo­lios, is a sig­nal that Sin­ga­pore is con­tin­u­ing on a steady course against chal­lenges that re­main se­vere – even as it seeks fresh ap­proaches in ar­eas such as the econ­omy, ed­u­ca­tion, in­fras­truc­ture and the so­cial front, so the coun­try can emerge from this cri­sis of a gen­er­a­tion pre­pared and stronger.</p>
    <p>This does not mean the tran­si­tion to a fourth­gen­er­a­tion lead­er­ship has taken a back seat. As the Cabi­net line-up shows, they con­tinue helm­ing a sig­nif­i­cant num­ber of min­istries, gain­ing ex­po­sure, grow­ing in ex­pe­ri­ence; and in­creas­ingly set the agenda and put their im­print on na­tional poli­cies. Even though the coro­n­avirus out­break caused a re­con­fig­u­ra­tion of na­tional im­per­a­tives and pri­or­i­ties, the cri­sis pro­vided lead­ers with a cru­cial test, one which obliged them to learn and re­act quickly – and from which they can only emerge stronger, wiser, and with strength­ened and steady hands. This puts them in good stead when the next po­lit­i­cal tran­si­tion takes place.</p>
    <p>The bal­ance between con­ti­nu­ity and change will also be felt in the new Par­lia­ment, given the Work­ers’ Party’s im­proved show­ing. The elec­torate’s de­sire for di­ver­sity in pol­i­tics, and for checks and bal­ances, is per­ma­nent. That di­ver­sity has been ad­dressed not just in Par­lia­ment, but also in the Cabi­net and rul­ing party’s lat­est slate of MPs. To­gether with ex­pec­ta­tions that op­po­si­tion par­ties will put up pro­pos­als that will also be scru­ti­nised, de­bate and pol­icy for­mu­la­tion will in­evitably take on a dif­fer­ent hue and tone.</p>
    <p>So much has, in­deed, changed. And the new Cabi­net re­flects the Gov­ern­ment’s pre­pared­ness to re­spond to the de­mands of a changed po­lit­i­cal and pol­icy land­scape, one that will con­tinue to evolve in the years to come.</p>
