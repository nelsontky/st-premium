    <p>Menus here could soon fea­ture chicken grown in fa­cil­i­ties such as biore­ac­tors in­stead of farms, as the au­thor­i­ties have deemed one such prod­uct safe for con­sump­tion.</p>
    <p>Reg­u­la­tory ap­provals are i n place for a par­tic­u­lar cul­tured chicken, mak­ing it the first time in the world that cul­tured meat prod­ucts will go on sale. These prod­ucts are made by cul­tur­ing an­i­mal cells in­stead of by slaugh­ter and are not yet avail­able for sale and con­sump­tion any­where else.</p>
    <p>The cul­tured chicken bites will be man­u­fac­tured in Sin­ga­pore by Cal­i­for­nian start-up Eat Just, said its chief ex­ec­u­tive Josh Tet­rick.</p>
    <p>“This paves the way for the prod­uct to be served in a restau­rant set­ting soon.” He did not give a time­line for when it might be avail­able. He said that for a start, the chicken bites would prob­a­bly cost as much as “pre­mium chicken... at a restau­rant”. But prices would fall as pro­duc­tion is scaled up, he added, not­ing that costs were al­ready a third of what they were a year ago.</p>
    <p>“To achieve our mis­sion, we’ll need to be be­low the cost of con­ven­tional chicken, which we ex­pect to hap­pen in the years ahead.”</p>
    <p>He said the chicken bites have the po­ten­tial to be halal-cer­ti­fied.</p>
    <p>The Sin­ga­pore Food Agency (SFA) said yes­ter­day it is al­low­ing Eat Just’s cul­tured chicken to be sold here af­ter its eval­u­a­tions have de­ter­mined it to be safe.</p>
    <p>Dr Tan Lee Kim, SFA di­rec­tor­gen­eral for food ad­min­is­tra­tion,</p>
    <p>said food safety was a prin­ci­pal con­sid­er­a­tion in pro­duc­tion. “SFA will re­view the safety as­sess­ments of these al­ter­na­tive pro­tein prod­ucts sci­en­tif­i­cally and con­sult ex­perts to safe­guard food safety and pub­lic health. We will also mon­i­tor such new prod­ucts when they en­ter the mar­ket,” she said.</p>
    <p>The eval­u­a­tion process in­cludes con­sid­er­ing fac­tors such as the prod­uct’s man­u­fac­tur­ing process and tox­i­c­ity of in­gre­di­ents, as well as whether the fi­nal prod­uct meets</p>
    <p>the stan­dards in food reg­u­la­tion.</p>
    <p>The SFA in Novem­ber last year pub­lished on its web­site a doc­u­ment de­tail­ing in­for­ma­tion that would be re­quired for the safety as­sess­ment of such novel foods. These in­clude cul­tured meat prod­ucts, such as Eat Just’s chicken bites, as well as cer­tain types of in­sect, al­gae and fungi-based pro­teins.</p>
    <p>The term novel foods refers to prod­ucts that do not have a his­tory of safe use – which is de­fined by the</p>
    <p>SFA as that of sub­stances con­sumed by a sig­nif­i­cant hu­man pop­u­la­tion as part of their diet for at least 20 years with­out re­ported ad­verse health ef­fects.</p>
    <p>Eat Just’s prod­uct is the first to pass the eval­u­a­tion process un­der the new reg­u­la­tory frame­work.</p>
    <p>In­ter­nal au­di­tor Heng Xian Zheng, 30, said price will be a key fac­tor in his de­ci­sion to try the chicken bites. “I don’t see why there’ll be a men­tal bar­rier to try the cul­tured chicken, es­pe­cially if it</p>
    <p>tastes the same. Plus, plenty of our food like flavour­ings and colour­ing is syn­thet­i­cally pro­duced.”</p>
    <p>Mr Daniel Govindan, 32, who works in a bank, said price will fac­tor into his will­ing­ness to try cul­tured meat. He also said he is hes­i­tant about the new tech­nol­ogy. “Some peo­ple might have an aver­sion to eat­ing some­thing grown in an ar­ti­fi­cial en­vi­ron­ment. More ed­u­ca­tion and out­reach ef­forts would have to be done to get peo­ple to change their minds.”</p>

    <p>While cul­tured meat is touted as hav­ing a lower car­bon foot­print than con­ven­tional meat, a sci­en­tific paper pub­lished in Fe­bru­ary said more stud­ies are needed to de­ter­mine its en­vi­ron­men­tal im­pact.</p>
