    <p>• An In­done­sian woman sus­pected of plan­ning a sui­cide bomb at­tack in the south­ern Philip­pines was ar­rested yes­ter­day in a pre-dawn raid, the mil­i­tary said.</p>
    <p>The ar­rest comes less than two months af­ter a pair of fe­male sui­cide bombers blew them­selves up on Jolo is­land in the Mus­lim­ma­jor­ity Sulu prov­ince, killing 15 peo­ple and wound­ing 74 oth­ers.</p>
    <p>Se­cu­rity forces blamed the Aug 24 at­tack on the Abu Sayyaf mil­i­tant group.</p>
    <p>The In­done­sian woman has been iden­ti­fied as Rezky Fan­ta­sya Rul­lie and is the wi­dow of an In­done­sian mil­i­tant killed i n Sulu in Au­gust, the Joint Task Force for the restive re­gion said in a state­ment.</p>
    <p>She is also be­lieved to be the daugh­ter of two sui­cide bombers who killed 21 peo­ple in an at­tack on a Catholic cathe­dral in Jolo early last year, it added.</p>
    <p>That at­tack was blamed on a group linked to Abu Sayyaf.</p>
    <p>“We have been pur­su­ing for­eign ter­ror­ist sui­cide bombers in Sulu af­ter the twin bomb­ing of Jolo town (in Au­gust),” said Bri­gadier-Gen­eral Wil­liam Gon­za­les.</p>
    <p>“Rul­lie was first on our list since we re­ceived in­tel­li­gence re­ports that she was go­ing to con­duct a sui­cide bomb­ing.”</p>
    <p>A vest rigged with pipe bombs was seized along with other im­pro­vised ex­plo­sive de­vice com­po­nents from a Jolo is­land house that is be­lieved to be owned by an Abu Sayyaf leader, the mil­i­tary said.</p>
    <p>Rul­lie was de­tained along with two women who are mar­ried to mem­bers of Abu Sayyaf, it added.</p>
    <p>Listed by the United States as a ter­ror­ist or­gan­i­sa­tion, Abu Sayyaf is a loose net­work of Is­lamist mil­i­tants blamed for the Philip­pines’ worst ter­ror at­tacks and kid­nap­pings of for­eign tourists and Chris­tian mis­sion­ar­ies.</p>
    <p>Sui­cide at­tacks were once very rare in the Philip­pines, but since July 2018 there have been at least five.</p>
    <p>The In­done­sian woman has been iden­ti­fied as Rezky Fan­ta­sya Rul­lie and is the wi­dow of an In­done­sian mil­i­tant killed in Sulu in Au­gust, the Joint Task Force for the restive re­gion said in a state­ment.</p>
