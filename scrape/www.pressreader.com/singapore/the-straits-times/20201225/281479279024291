    <p>With Sin­ga­pore im­pos­ing en­try re­stric­tions on trav­ellers from Bri­tain due to a more con­ta­gious strain of the coro­n­avirus there, those in­tend­ing to fly here are wor­ried that air­lines will cut flights.</p>
    <p>Some note that with many Sin­ga­pore­ans in Bri­tain mar­ried to Bri­tish na­tion­als, trav­el­ling here with their fam­ily mem­bers be­comes com­pli­cated due to the new re­stric­tions, which bar those who are not Sin­ga­pore­ans or per­ma­nent res­i­dents from en­ter­ing or tran­sit­ing through the coun­try.</p>
    <p>Dr Di­lane Peiris, 35, had four air tick­ets booked from Lon­don to Mel­bourne via Sin­ga­pore on New Year’s Eve, but his fam­ily travel plans to kick-start 2021 have been thrown into dis­ar­ray.</p>
    <p>Fol­low­ing the an­nounce­ment that a new and more in­fec­tious strain of coro­n­avirus is cir­cu­lat­ing in Bri­tain, more than 40 coun­tries, in­clud­ing Sin­ga­pore, have tight­ened re­stric­tions on in­bound trav­ellers from the coun­try.</p>
    <p>As of yes­ter­day, any­one who is not a Sin­ga­porean or per­ma­nent res­i­dent, with travel his­tory to Bri­tain within the last 14 days, in­clud­ing those who had ob­tained prior ap­proval for en­try, will no longer be al­lowed to en­ter or tran­sit through Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>Re­turn­ing Sin­ga­pore­ans and PRs, who will be tested on ar­rival, will still be al­lowed in. As be­fore, they will be put un­der a 14-day stay­home no­tice at ded­i­cated fa­cil­i­ties, but will be tested again to­wards the end of this pe­riod.</p>
    <p>Dr Peiris, a Sin­ga­porean, was set to move to Aus­tralia with his fam­ily for a one-year fel­low­ship next year.</p>
    <p>The doc­tor is mar­ried to a Bri­tish na­tional and has two sons – aged 21/ years and seven months – both also Bri­tish na­tion­als.</p>
    <p>While he is al­lowed to con­tinue on his flight as planned un­der the lat­est travel stip­u­la­tions, his fam­ily will not be al­lowed to board the tran­sit flight through Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>“We had as­sumed that Sin­ga­pore would not ban trav­ellers be­cause of the al­ready quite ro­bust quar­an­tine mea­sures. My wife and chil­dren are with me all the time.</p>
    <p>“So, if I am al­lowed to travel, the risk they pose to the Sin­ga­pore pop­u­la­tion would likely not be higher,”</p>
    <p>NO RE­UNION THIS YEAR</p>
    <p>Even though there was only a slim chance of me spend­ing Christ­mas with my fam­ily be­cause of how ex­pen­sive the stay-home no­tice 2 ho­tels (in Sin­ga­pore) are, there is now no chance I will get to see my fam­ily this year.</p>
    <p>MR GEORGE BRYDEN, 25, an op­er­a­tions an­a­lyst liv­ing in Sin­ga­pore, on fly­ing back to Bri­tain to see his fam­ily over the hol­i­days.</p>
    <p>he told The Straits Times yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>He has made an ap­peal to the Sin­ga­pore High Com­mis­sion in Lon­don and the Im­mi­gra­tion and Check­points Au­thor­ity.</p>
    <p>“I un­der­stand where the au­thor­i­ties are com­ing from. The Sin­ga­pore Gov­ern­ment has done such a good job. But we will not be go­ing into Sin­ga­pore. We don’t even have to en­ter the air­port (if we are al­lowed to re­main on the plane).”</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore Air­lines said the 14 flights be­tween Lon­don and Sin­ga­pore that it op­er­ates weekly will not be af­fected by the lat­est change to Covid-19 re­stric­tions.</p>
    <p>But those in­tend­ing to fly here are wor­ried. With the sit­u­a­tion in flux, they say they ex­pect air­lines to re­duce flights, es­pe­cially if they are un­able to fill planes with Sin­ga­pore­ans and PRs alone.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­porean Radha Nair, the pres­i­dent of the Sin­ga­pore UK As­so­ci­a­tion, said many Sin­ga­pore­ans liv­ing in Bri­tain are mar­ried to Bri­tish na­tion­als. This com­pli­cates travel ar­range­ments, as some of them were think­ing of fly­ing back over the fes­tive sea­son to avoid the es­ca­lat­ing cri­sis in Bri­tain.</p>
    <p>Mrs Nair, 37, said: “I am not re­ally scared but am wary of go­ing out for nor­mal walks, now that there is some ev­i­dence that even chil­dren can be in­fected by the new strain of the coro­n­avirus.”</p>
    <p>She has not taken her two chil­dren, aged four and seven, for their usual walks since the Bri­tish gov­ern­ment made the an­nounce­ment on the new virus strain last Satur­day.</p>
    <p>The teacher goes out only for gro­cery runs now, and wears her gloves and mask when do­ing so.</p>
    <p>“Many Sin­ga­pore­ans book their flights only one or two days be­fore they in­tend to fly due to the un­pre­dictabil­ity of the sit­u­a­tion.</p>
    <p>“This makes it even more un­cer­tain,” she said of the pos­si­ble flight cuts be­tween Bri­tain and Sin­ga­pore in the long term.</p>
    <p>Op­er­a­tions an­a­lyst George Bryden, 25, who is liv­ing in Sin­ga­pore, said the new re­stric­tions put paid to any pos­si­bil­ity of him fly­ing back to Bri­tain to see his fam­ily over the hol­i­days.</p>
    <p>“Even though there was only a slim chance of me spend­ing Christ­mas with my fam­ily be­cause of how ex­pen­sive the stay-home no­tice ho­tels (in Sin­ga­pore) are, there is now no chance I will get to see my fam­ily this year,” he said.</p>
