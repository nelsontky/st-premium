    <p>Pub­lisher Mar­shall Cavendish Ed­u­ca­tion has apol­o­gised to read­ers for caus­ing any mis­un­der­stand­ing af­ter a com­plaint sur­faced that a Chi­nese-lan­guage chil­dren’s book it pub­lished is racist.</p>
    <p>It said on its Face­book page that it will cease the sale and dis­tri­bu­tion of the Amaz­ing Ad­ven­tures Of Pi Pi se­ries, which con­sists of five books. Copies of the book Who Wins? will be re­called from re­tail stores.</p>
    <p>The pic­ture book by Wu Xing Hua fea­tures a “dark-skinned” boy with “oily curly hair” named Mao Mao – which means hairy in Chi­nese – as an ag­gres­sive school bully.</p>
    <p>The book, avail­able for loan through the Na­tional Li­brary Board (NLB), was re­moved for a re­view last Sun­day.</p>
    <p>This was af­ter li­brary user Estella Young high­lighted the book’s racial un­der­tones in a Face­book post on July 17.</p>
    <p>In her post, she ques­tioned the ra­tio­nale be­hind Mar­shall Cavendish Ed­u­ca­tion pub­lish­ing the book, in which the only dark-skinned char­ac­ter is por­trayed as “ir­re­deemably nasty”, de­spite his ap­pear­ance not con­tribut­ing to the plot.</p>
    <p>In its apol­ogy, the pub­lisher said it had no in­ten­tion to pro­duce con­tent pro­mot­ing dis­crim­i­na­tion in any way.</p>
    <p>“The books we pub­lish cater to an all-in­clu­sive so­ci­ety where di­ver­sity is re­spected and cel­e­brated, and our team is ded­i­cated and com­mit­ted to that cause,” it added.</p>
