    <p>The world is si­mul­ta­ne­ously faced with three crises: a health cri­sis, an eco­nomic cri­sis and a global governance cri­sis. To tackle them ef­fec­tively will re­quire coun­tries of the world to work to­gether to find prac­ti­cal com­mon so­lu­tions.</p>
    <p>Asia and Europe have a ma­jor role to play in this en­deav­our. We wish to ar­gue, in this es­say, that by act­ing to­gether, the lead­ers of Asia and Europe can pro­vide the world with the lead­er­ship, re­solve and pol­icy ideas. They should also en­list the sup­port of like-minded coun­tries in other re­gions of the world.</p>
    <p>ASIA-EUROPE MEET­ING (ASEM)</p>
    <p>A his­toric meet­ing took place in Bangkok on March 1 and 2 in 1996. At the sug­ges­tion of then Sin­ga­pore Prime Min­is­ter Goh Chok Tong, 10 lead­ers from Asia met 16 lead­ers from Europe to be­gin the process of build­ing a new bridge con­nect­ing the two re­gions and their peo­ples. The bridge would have three pil­lars: first, po­lit­i­cal; sec­ond, eco­nom­ics and fi­nance; and third, so­cial, cul­tural and ed­u­ca­tional.</p>
    <p>The meet­ing also es­tab­lished the Asia-Europe Foun­da­tion (Asef), which was set up the fol­low­ing year and based in Sin­ga­pore. Asef is the only in­sti­tu­tion which Asem has es­tab­lished. Its man­date is to pro­mote bet­ter mu­tual un­der­stand­ing be­tween Asians and Euro­peans through in­tel­lec­tual, cul­tural and peo­ple-to-peo­ple ex­changes. Over the past 23 years, Asef has brought to­gether more than 40,000 Asian and Euro­pean par­tic­i­pants in sem­i­nars, con­fer­ences, in­tern­ships and projects cov­er­ing cul­ture, ed­u­ca­tion, governance and econ­omy, me­dia, pub­lic health, sus­tain­able de­vel­op­ment, hu­man rights and civil so­ci­ety.</p>
    <p>Asem has ex­panded from the orig­i­nal 26 to 53 part­ners: 30 Euro­pean coun­tries and the Euro­pean Com­mis­sion and 21 Asian coun­tries and the Asean Sec­re­tariat.</p>
    <p>As a group­ing, Asem ac­counts for 60 per cent of the world’s pop­u­la­tion and 65 per cent of the world’s econ­omy.</p>
    <p>It is there­fore a group of coun­tries with weight and in­flu­ence. We ap­peal to the lead­ers of Asem to rise to the chal­lenge and pro­vide the much-needed lead­er­ship and re­solve to steer the world through its cur­rent crises.</p>
    <p>THE FIRST CRI­SIS</p>
    <p>The first cri­sis is the health cri­sis. Covid-19 has caused the world’s worst pan­demic since the Span­ish flu. To date, it has in­fected more than 15 mil­lion peo­ple and killed more than 600,000. The virus has spread to all parts of the world.</p>
    <p>Here is what the lead­ers of Asem can do to de­feat Covid-19.</p>
    <p>First, share good prac­tices with one an­other. Some Asem part­ners have done bet­ter in fight­ing the coro­n­avirus than oth­ers. Those that have done well should share their best prac­tices with other coun­tries.</p>
    <p>Sec­ond, Asem should agree and per­suade oth­ers not to im­pose re­stric­tions on the ex­port of per­sonal pro­tec­tive equip­ment (PPE) such as sur­gi­cal masks, iso­la­tion gowns, gloves, ven­ti­la­tors and test kits, as well as medicines. It can also utilise the Asef Pub­lic Health Net­work, which deals with ca­pac­ity build­ing and stock­piles of anti-vi­ral drugs and PPE.</p>
    <p>Third, Asem should en­cour­age the sci­en­tists and doc­tors of the two re­gions to share their re­search and to do joint re­search on vac­ci­na­tions and ther­a­peu­tics.</p>
    <p>Fourth, if a vac­cine or a cure is dis­cov­ered, Asem should agree to make it an in­ter­na­tional pub­lic good. In this way, it will be­come af­ford­able and avail­able to all the coun­tries of the world.</p>
    <p>THE SEC­OND CRI­SIS</p>
    <p>The sec­ond cri­sis is the eco­nomic cri­sis. Covid-19 has essen­tially forced the world econ­omy to shut down. The In­ter­na­tional Mone­tary Fund has stated that this eco­nomic cri­sis will be as bad as the Great De­pres­sion of the 1930s.</p>
    <p>The Covid-19 pan­demic has led to more than a third of the world’s pop­u­la­tion be­ing placed un­der lock­down to stop the spread of the virus. There is a rapid in­crease in un­em­ploy­ment in many coun­tries. The tourism and hos­pi­tal­ity in­dus­tries have col­lapsed. The en­ergy in­dus­try has been badly hurt. Re­mit­tances have dried up. The poor and the mi­grant work­ers have suf­fered the most.</p>
    <p>What can Asem do to shorten the re­ces­sion and to ac­cel­er­ate the re­cov­ery?</p>
    <p>First, Asem should agree to keep their economies open, to sup­port free trade and re­gional eco­nomic in­te­gra­tion. There is a grave dan­ger that be­cause of the cri­sis, coun­tries will be­come pro­tec­tion­ist and will seek to de­glob­alise. This should be re­sisted, and a se­ri­ous at­tempt should be made to per­suade ma­jor coun­tries be­yond Asia and Europe to join in this ef­fort.</p>
    <p>Sec­ond, they should agree to keep their sea­ports and air­ports open. They should fa­cil­i­tate, not ob­struct, the re­sump­tion of travel, as soon as pos­si­ble and pro­vided the nec­es­sary safety mea­sures are ob­served.</p>
    <p>Third, they should al­low the mar­ket to de­ter­mine the sup­ply chains of com­pa­nies and in­dus­tries. Be­cause sup­ply chains have been dis­rupted dur­ing the cri­sis, some coun­tries may be re­luc­tant to re­store them. Other coun­tries may have po­lit­i­cal rea­sons to ex­clude some coun­tries from those chains. Asem can play a lead­er­ship role to demon­strate how in­clu­sive and open sup­ply chains can ben­e­fit all coun­tries de­ter­mined to do their part.</p>
    <p>Fourth, they should use their in­flu­ence to pre­vent in­ter­na­tional trade and tech­nol­ogy from be­ing split into two ri­val blocs: a United States-cen­tric bloc and a China-cen­tric bloc.</p>
    <p>His­tory has shown that ri­val trade and eco­nomic blocs are detri­men­tal to all par­ties. Asem should pre­vail on both sides to look at con­crete ways to work to­gether to ad­dress these global crises and, in the process, re­build the trust to set­tle their dif­fer­ences peace­fully.</p>
    <p>THE THIRD CRI­SIS</p>
    <p>The third cri­sis is the cri­sis of global governance. Mul­ti­lat­er­al­ism is un­der at­tack. Mul­ti­lat­eral in­sti­tu­tions such as the World Trade Or­gan­i­sa­tion (WTO) and the World Health Or­gan­i­sa­tion (WHO) are be­ing un­der­mined. The Paris Agree­ment on cli­mate change and the United Na­tions’ sus­tain­able de­vel­op­ment goals are fac­ing chal­lenges on sev­eral fronts. The lead­ers of Asia and Europe can play a valu­able role in de­fend­ing mul­ti­lat­er­al­ism and the en­vi­ron­ment.</p>
    <p>First, Asem should con­tinue to strongly sup­port mul­ti­lat­er­al­ism and its in­sti­tu­tions. Sec­ond, in the case of the WTO, Asem’s po­si­tion should be that it is for the re­form of the in­sti­tu­tion. How­ever, it will op­pose any at­tempt to de­stroy the in­sti­tu­tion in the guise of re­form.</p>
    <p>Third, Asem should sup­port the WHO, which plays an in­dis­pens­able role in safe­guard­ing the health of the peo­ple of the world. Part­ners should strengthen the or­gan­i­sa­tion and its fi­nances. A higher per­cent­age of the WHO’s bud­get should come from the as­sessed con­tri­bu­tions of mem­ber states. This will strengthen the WHO’s in­de­pen­dence and re­duce its de­pen­dence on vol­un­tary con­tri­bu­tions.</p>
    <p>Fourth, cli­mate change and sus­tain­able de­vel­op­ment should be ac­corded the high­est pri­or­ity. This is be­cause if we don’t em­brace sus­tain­able de­vel­op­ment and fight cli­mate change, our very ex­is­tence on this planet will be in peril. Asem must take a strong stand on these is­sues.</p>
    <p>CON­CLU­SION</p>
    <p>The world is faced with three crises si­mul­ta­ne­ously. The world is adrift be­cause of the ab­sence of a leader.</p>
    <p>We ap­peal to the lead­ers of Asia and Europe, act­ing through Asem, to lead the world in tack­ling the crises.</p>
