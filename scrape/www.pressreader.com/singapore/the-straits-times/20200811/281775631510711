    <p>BER­LIN • Ger­man com­pa­nies ex­pect pub­lic life to be re­stricted for a fur­ther 81/ months due to the coro</p>
    <p>2 navirus cri­sis, a sur­vey by the Ifo eco­nomic in­sti­tute showed yes­ter­day, as Europe’s largest econ­omy strug­gles to re­cover from its pan­demic-in­duced down­turn.</p>
    <p>The coun­try’s leisure firms, hit hard by the Covid-19 out­break, are par­tic­u­larly pes­simistic, ex­pect­ing re­stric­tions to last an­other 13 months, while the bev­er­age sec­tor is more op­ti­mistic, fore­see­ing an end to re­stric­tions in 6.4 months.</p>
    <p>The num­ber of con­firmed coro­n­avirus cases in Ger­many rose by 436 to 216,327, data from the Robert Koch In­sti­tute for in­fec­tious dis­eases showed yes­ter­day. The re­ported death toll in­creased by one to 9,197, the tally showed.</p>
    <p>Scores of Ger­man school­child­ren re­turned to the class­room in some</p>
    <p>Ger­man states, in­clud­ing Ber­lin and Bran­den­burg, yes­ter­day. Oth­ers, such as those in North RhineWest­phalia, will re­open to­day.</p>
    <p>Stu­dents in the states of Ham­burg and Meck­len­burg-Western Pomera­nia were the first to re­turn to school last week af­ter the sum­mer break, European news pub­lisher The Lo­cal re­ported.</p>
    <p>Sum­mer hol­i­days are stag­gered in Ger­many, so not all of its 16 fed­eral states go on va­ca­tion at the same time, avoid­ing a clog­ging of the na­tion’s air­ports and trans­port sys­tems, ac­cord­ing to Ger­man broad­caster Deutsche Welle.</p>
    <p>There has been pub­lic de­bate over whether chil­dren should have to wear masks in school, and the au­thor­i­ties’ ap­proach has var­ied from state to state.</p>
    <p>In the state of Schleswig-Hol­stein, which re­opened schools yes­ter­day, the Ed­u­ca­tion Min­istry has stopped short of man­dat­ing masks, in­stead urg­ing stu­dents and teach­ers to wear cov­er­ings over their mouth and nose.</p>
    <p>But al­ready, a school near the city of Husum in Schleswig-Hol­stein has had to close as a pre­cau­tion­ary mea­sure due to a teacher be­com­ing in­fected with Covid-19.</p>
