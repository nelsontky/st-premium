    <p>• When it comes to Amer­ica’s pres­i­den­tial elec­tions, the say­ing goes: An Oc­to­ber sur­prise is never a good sur­prise.</p>
    <p>And came it did, and with a rush at the start of the month, with Pres­i­dent Donald Trump get­ting Covid-19 and be­ing he­li­coptered out of the White House to Wal­ter Reed hos­pi­tal late on Fri­day.</p>
    <p>The new un­cer­tainty adds to an al­ready tense and volatile po­lit­i­cal land­scape.</p>
    <p>Elec­tion 2020 could be de­scribed as Amer­ica packed in a pickup truck in which ev­ery­one is ar­gu­ing, some have guns and some are pray­ing, caught in a hail­storm and ca­reen­ing to­wards a ma­jor fork in the road.</p>
    <p>The stakes in the po­larised na­tion are that high – not just for the United States it­self, but for the world as well.</p>
    <p>FOR THE WORLD:</p>
    <p>The elec­tion it­self is loom­ing as a ma­jor chal­lenge. It is a tru­ism that peo­ple ei­ther love Pres­i­dent Trump or hate him.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump has pre­sented the choice ahead as bi­nary – a so­cial­ist hell ver­sus a cap­i­tal­ist heaven; god­less­ness ver­sus re­li­gious­ness; an­ar­chists and un­ruly il­le­gal im­mi­grants ver­sus law and or­der; low-cost (mostly African Amer­i­can and im­mi­grant) hous­ing ver­sus salu­bri­ous (mostly white) sub­ur­bia; gun con­trol ver­sus gun rights.</p>
    <p>Right-wing white mili­tia are em­bold­ened, ex­perts say – and they are not the only mili­tia. The ghosts of Amer­ica’s Civil War and the en­su­ing 100-year strug­gle for civil rights still stalk the land­scape.</p>
    <p>With the Pres­i­dent hav­ing said ex­plic­itly, and many times, that the only way he will lose the elec­tion is if it is rigged, for the first time in liv­ing mem­ory a peace­ful trans­fer of power is in doubt. Amer­ica thus faces not only a test of its demo­cratic tra­di­tions and in­sti­tu­tions, but of Amer­i­can ex­cep­tion­al­ism it­self.</p>
    <p>If for­mer vice-pres­i­dent Joe Bi­den and his mul­ti­cul­tural run­ning mate, Se­na­tor Ka­mala Har­ris, win on Nov 3 – or even­tu­ally, given that the re­sult might well be con­tested, po­ten­tially plung­ing the US into tur­moil – it would mean an Amer­ica still com­mit­ted to a lib­eral path.</p>
    <p>Fun­da­men­tally in­ter­na­tion­al­ist, Mr Bi­den may not quite re­turn to un­tram­melled glob­al­ism, given the fierce re­sis­tance to it which helped bring Mr Trump to power in 2016. Nor will the in­ten­si­fy­ing com­pe­ti­tion with China go away.</p>
    <p>But he would re­store Amer­i­can en­gage­ment in some mul­ti­lat­eral agree­ments and in­sti­tu­tions, and en­cour­age more di­plo­matic en­gage­ment with al­lies. Cli­mate change would be back on the agenda after four years of sci­ence scep­ti­cism – if not out­right de­nial­ism – un­der Mr Trump.</p>
    <p>And for the in­ter­na­tional com­mu­nity, it would be a re­turn to some pre­dictabil­ity.</p>
    <p>MEAN­WHILE, AT HOME...</p>
    <p>But at home, where it counts in elec­tions (for­eign policy, un­less the US is in a war, is low on the av­er­age voter’s list of pri­or­i­ties), it would mark the em­brac­ing of an in­clu­sive rather than an in­ward-look­ing, na­tivist Amer­ica. A Bi­den ad­min­is­tra­tion would look more rep­re­sen­ta­tive of Amer­ica’s di­ver­sity – and would have to carry all Amer­i­cans along.</p>
    <p>A sec­ond term for Mr Trump would, in ef­fect, con­sol­i­date power in the hands of re­li­gious con­ser­va­tives. Even if the Repub­li­cans lose con­trol of the Se­nate, they would have the White House, plus, if Supreme Court Justice nom­i­nee Amy Coney</p>
    <p>Bar­rett is con­firmed – which is likely – a con­ser­va­tive bench.</p>
    <p>More widely in the ju­di­ciary, Mr Trump had, by July ac­cord­ing to Pew Re­search, ap­pointed al­most a quar­ter of all ac­tive fed­eral judges. In that as­pect, even if Mr Trump loses, ex­e­cut­ing that core con­ser­va­tive agenda will be his legacy, en­dur­ing for years, even decades. The elec­tion out­come will not change that. A Bi­den win, or even a Demo­cratic sweep, would not in it­self lead to any fun­da­men­tal changes in the now sig­nif­i­cantly con­ser­va­tive ju­di­ciary.</p>
    <p>This is the “last stand of re­li­gious and evan­gel­i­cal con­ser­va­tives”, Dr Glenn Altschuler, pro­fes­sor of Amer­i­can stud­ies at Cor­nell Univer­sity, tells The Sun­day Times. “The per­cent­age of white evan­gel­i­cals, even if you in­clude evan­gel­i­cal Catholics, as well as Protes­tants... in the Amer­i­can pop­u­la­tion is go­ing down.</p>
    <p>“The ap­peal of Donald Trump to evan­gel­i­cals has been... (that) we will soon be out­num­bered and out­gunned. And there­fore this at least tem­po­rar­ily gives us a greater hold on power, with the pos­si­bil­ity or like­li­hood of be­ing able to ex­er­cise that power for a longer pe­riod of time, even if we’re less likely to pre­vail in elec­tions.</p>
    <p>“The sense of ur­gency that re­li­gious con­ser­va­tives have is clearly con­nected to some sense that their op­por­tu­nity to con­trol the levers of gov­ern­ment is run­ning out.”</p>
    <p>The con­ser­va­tive right, con­ser­va­tive re­li­gious groups, and con­ser­va­tive anti-tax groups, have all won a ma­jor vic­tory in the ap­point­ment of judges, says Dr T. J. Pem­pel, pro­fes­sor of po­lit­i­cal sci­ence at the Univer­sity of Cal­i­for­nia, Berke­ley.</p>
    <p>“Al­most ev­ery­body that has been ap­pointed… is a part of the Fed­er­al­ist So­ci­ety, which is a group ded­i­cated to the so-called orig­i­nal­ist doc­trine,” Dr Pem­pel tells The Sun­day Times.</p>
    <p>The Fed­er­al­ist So­ci­ety, a pow­er­ful na­tion­wide or­gan­i­sa­tion of con­ser­va­tive lawyers, ad­vo­cates a tex­tu­al­ist and orig­i­nal­ist in­ter­pre­ta­tion of the Con­sti­tu­tion.</p>
    <p>DEMOC­RACY AT STAKE?</p>
    <p>Mean­while, al­most ev­ery sce­nario less than an out­right, in­dis­putable win by one or the other can­di­date, has the US head­ing into a con­sti­tu­tional cri­sis in which the re­sult of the elec­tion is chal­lenged by one side or the other in the courts and in the streets.</p>
    <p>“I do think that at stake, is very much the whole fu­ture of Amer­i­can democ­racy,” Dr Pem­pel tells The Sun­day Times. “I don’t want to sound para­noid, but I’ve stud­ied the mil­i­tary and the au­thor­i­tar­i­ans’ takeover in Ja­pan. I’ve looked at it in Ger­many. And this is start­ing to look very fa­mil­iar to me.</p>
    <p>“From my stand­point we’re five weeks from in­sti­tu­tion­alised au­thor­i­tar­i­an­ism. So much of Amer­i­can ex­cep­tion­al­ism has hinged on... most po­lit­i­cal elites ac­cept­ing norms (but) now it’s sim­ply about pure power.”</p>
    <p>His­to­rian and au­thor Ed­ward Watts of the Univer­sity of Cal­i­for­nia, San Diego, has been quoted as say­ing in a Sept 25 ar­ti­cle in For­eign Policy: “If Trump is re-elected, then I think the norms and re­straints of Amer­i­can democ­racy dis­ap­pear com­pletely.”</p>
    <p>How­ever, Ge­orge­town</p>
    <p>Univer­sity po­lit­i­cal scientist Charles Kupchan, an au­thor and for­mer diplo­mat, has told For­eign Policy that if Mr Trump is re-elected, that would be “an af­fir­ma­tion this is the di­rec­tion Amer­i­cans want to go”.</p>
    <p>The elec­tion of­fers a stark choice – but who­ever wins, it will also do little to as­suage po­lit­i­cal and cul­tural ten­sions.</p>
    <p>“The po­lar­i­sa­tion is go­ing to out­last Trump in a big way – it is su­per­charged,” warns pro­fes­sor of in­ter­na­tional pol­i­tics Inderjeet Par­mar at the City, Univer­sity of London.</p>
