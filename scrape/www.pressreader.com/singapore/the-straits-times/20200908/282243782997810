    <p>La Liga pres­i­dent Javier Te­bas in­sisted yes­ter­day that he was never “se­ri­ously wor­ried” that Lionel Messi would leave Barcelona as the Spanish league has been pre­par­ing for an era with­out the six-time Bal­lon d’Or winner.</p>
    <p>“I was wor­ried but not se­ri­ously wor­ried. Ob­vi­ously we want Messi to be with us be­cause I’ve al­ways said he’s prob­a­bly the best player in the his­tory of foot­ball,” said Te­bas in the La Liga Kick-off 20-21 event, which was streamed live on YouTube. “But we’ve been work­ing for many years on the fact that La Liga’s brand has to be above in­di­vid­ual play­ers and clubs.”</p>
    <p>This comes as Messi said last week that he will re­main at Barca for an­other year af­ter ini­tially an­nounc­ing that he wanted to leave.</p>
    <p>La Liga then re­leased a state­ment on Aug 30 say­ing that his con­tract was still valid and the only way he could leave was if a club trig­gered the €700 mil­lion (S$1.13 bil­lion) re­lease clause, days af­ter his shock an­nounce­ment and hours af­ter he failed to at­tend a pre-sea­son med­i­cal test.</p>
    <p>Messi yes­ter­day re­ported for club train­ing for the first time since hand­ing in the trans­fer re­quest. But the pos­si­bil­ity of the Ar­gen­tinian leav­ing next year may force Spanish clubs to look for new mar­quee play­ers, such as Atletico Madrid’s Joao Felix, 20, and Barcelona’s Ansu Fati, 17.</p>
    <p>Te­bas added: “Ansu Fati started from the bot­tom in the (La Ma­sia) academy. If he con­tin­ues what he’s do­ing, like what we’ve seen so far... He had a great match (on Sun­day with Spain) and I think he’s bril­liant and got good feet.”</p>
    <p>Fati, nick­named the “jewel of La Ma­sia”, be­came his coun­try’s youngest scorer when he net­ted in their 4-0 vic­tory over Ukraine in the Na­tions League.</p>
    <p>He made his Barcelona se­nior de­but in Au­gust last year and has seven goals in 24 ap­pear­ances.</p>
    <p>Be­sides still get­ting to see Messi in a Barca shirt, La Liga fans can also look for­ward to a more im­mer­sive view­ing ex­pe­ri­ence with the use of aug­mented re­al­ity. Graph­ics such as player pro­files and sta­tis­tics, in­clud­ing suc­cess rates of free kicks and penalty kicks, will be shown in re­al­time dur­ing matches.</p>
    <p>The new La Liga sea­son kicks off on Fri­day.</p>
