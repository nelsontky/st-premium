    <p>LON­DON Bri­tish sci­en­tists are try­ing to es­tab­lish whether the rapid spread in south­ern Eng­land of a new vari­ant of the novel coron­avirus is linked to key mu­ta­tions they have de­tected in the strain.</p>
    <p>The mu­ta­tions in­clude changes to the im­por­tant “spike” pro­tein that the Sars-CoV-2 coron­avirus uses to in­fect hu­man cells, a group of sci­en­tists track­ing the virus’ ge­net­ics said yes­ter­day, but it is not yet clear if these are mak­ing it more in­fec­tious.</p>
    <p>“Ef­forts are un­der way to con­firm whether or not any of these mu­ta­tions are con­tribut­ing to in­creased trans­mis­sion,” said the sci­en­tists, from the Covid-19 Ge­nomics UK Con­sor­tium.</p>
    <p>The new vari­ant, named by the sci­en­tists as “VUI – 202012/01”, in­cludes a ge­netic mu­ta­tion in the “spike” pro­tein, which, in the­ory, could re­sult in Covid-19 spread­ing more eas­ily be­tween peo­ple.</p>
    <p>The Bri­tish govern­ment on Mon­day cited a rise in new in­fec­tions, which it said may be partly linked to the new vari­ant, as its cap­i­tal city and many other ar­eas move into the high­est tier of re­stric­tions.</p>
    <p>As of Sun­day, 1,108 Covid-19 cases with the new vari­ant had been iden­ti­fied, pre­dom­i­nantly in the south and east of Eng­land.</p>
    <p>But there is cur­rently no ev­i­dence that the vari­ant is more likely to cause se­vere Covid-19 in­fec­tions, the sci­en­tists said, or that it would ren­der vac­cines less ef­fec­tive. “Both ques­tions re­quire fur­ther stud­ies per­formed at pace.”</p>
    <p>Mu­ta­tions, or ge­netic changes, arise nat­u­rally in all viruses, in­clud­ing Sars-CoV-2, as they repli­cate and cir­cu­late in hu­man pop­u­la­tions. In the case of Sars-CoV-2, these mu­ta­tions are ac­cu­mu­lat­ing at a rate of around one to two mu­ta­tions per month glob­ally, said the Covid-19 Ge­nomics UK Con­sor­tium’s ge­net­ics spe­cial­ists.</p>
    <p>“As a re­sult of this on­go­ing process, many thou­sands of mu­ta­tions have al­ready arisen in the Sars-CoV-2 genome since the virus emerged in 2019,” they said.</p>
    <p>Most of the mu­ta­tions seen so far have had no ap­par­ent ef­fect on the virus, and only a mi­nor­ity are likely to change the virus in any sig­nif­i­cant way – for ex­am­ple, mak­ing it more able to in­fect peo­ple, more likely to cause se­vere ill­ness, or be less sen­si­tive to nat­u­ral or vac­cinein­duced im­mune de­fences.</p>
    <p>The World Health Or­gan­i­sa­tion said it is aware of the ge­netic vari­ant, adding that it is work­ing with a net­work of global lab­o­ra­to­ries to see if this vari­ant is be­com­ing more preva­lent around the world.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, mil­lions of Lon­don­ers will be or­dered to com­ply with Eng­land’s tough­est Covid-19 rules from to­day. The switch to tier three rules from tier two will see pubs, bars and restau­rants closed, ex­cept for serv­ing take­away meals. The­atres and mu­se­ums will also be shut.</p>
    <p>Health Sec­re­tary Matt Han­cock said he un­der­stands the tighter mea­sures will be dif­fi­cult but in­sisted they are es­sen­tial to pro­tect lives and jobs in the longer term.</p>
    <p>“This ac­tion is ab­so­lutely es­sen­tial, not just to keep peo­ple safe, but be­cause as we’ve seen early ac­tion can help pre­vent more dam­ag­ing and longer last­ing prob­lems later,” he said.</p>
    <p>Be­tween Dec 23 and 27, how­ever, peo­ple will be free to min­gle with two other house­holds in­doors as they cel­e­brate Christmas. Doc­tors have warned that this will lead to a rise in in­fec­tions and hos­pi­tal­i­sa­tion rates next month and in Fe­bru­ary.</p>
