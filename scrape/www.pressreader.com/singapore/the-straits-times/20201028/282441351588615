    <p>Gam­bling-like el­e­ments in many video games, com­monly called loot boxes, have been a con­cern among so­cial work­ers and gamers like my­self for many years now.</p>
    <p>So it is re­as­sur­ing when the Min­istry of Ed­u­ca­tion (MOE) told The Straits Times ear­lier this month that pri­mary and sec­ondary school stu­dents will be get­ting re­sources to teach stu­dents about the “dan­gers of loot boxes” from next year.</p>
    <p>It has been a long time com­ing and will hope­fully raise more aware­ness.</p>
    <p>Loot boxes, which con­tain ran­dom re­wards and can be bought in­di­rectly with cash, have been likened by ad­dic­tion ex­perts to casino slot ma­chines and linked to prob­lem gam­bling. The chance to get prized items from th­ese boxes can be less than 1 per cent, but wor­ry­ingly, some game com­pa­nies have been ac­cused of im­prov­ing th­ese rates on the fly so as to pro­mote loot-box games.</p>
    <p>And un­like, for in­stance, phys­i­cal packs for trad­ing card games with ran­dom cards, loot boxes of­ten never run out of stock at shops, are more eas­ily pur­chased multiple times, and tend to be tightly in­te­grated into games with flashy lights and sounds to tempt play­ers to buy the dig­i­tal boxes.</p>
    <p>So­cial work­ers fear that the “rush” which play­ers can get from open­ing loot boxes may spur them to spend to open more of th­ese boxes or find sim­i­lar ad­dic­tions to get the same dopamine high.</p>
    <p>In­deed, there are re­ports ev­ery now and then of a young per­son who spent hun­dreds to thou­sands of dol­lars – of­ten their par­ents’ money – on loot boxes be­cause they got hooked.</p>
    <p>Also trou­bling is that, un­like casi­nos, loot boxes can be eas­ily ac­cessed by undis­cern­ing chil­dren and teenagers with­out much warn­ing and per­haps for many years, since th­ese vir­tual goodie bags have ap­peared in games since the mid-2000s.</p>
    <p>For ex­am­ple, last year’s Fifa 20, which has an up­front price tag, is rated in the United States as suit­able for ev­ery­one to play. The pop­u­lar free-to-down­load mo­bile game Gen­shin Im­pact, launched last month, is deemed as suit­able for those aged nine and above on the Ap­ple App Store.</p>
    <p>Al­though both ti­tles have loot boxes, there is no in­di­ca­tion in their age rat­ings that they have them, ex­cept a gen­eral de­scrip­tion that play­ers can make pur­chases within the game. But this can also ap­ply to ti­tles with­out loot boxes.</p>
    <p>To fur­ther en­cour­age spend­ing, many games fea­ture loot boxes with spe­cial ran­dom re­wards for a lim­ited time. This feeds on the fear of play­ers miss­ing out.</p>
    <p>MOE’s de­ci­sion to try and ed­u­cate stu­dents about the ills of loot boxes, even though this topic is op­tional for teach­ers to in­clude in lessons, is thus a sig­nif­i­cant step.</p>
    <p>Con­sid­er­ing the po­ten­tial dan­gers, the au­thor­i­ties can go fur­ther and make such ed­u­ca­tion com­pul­sory, though it could be seen as over-reach­ing in some quar­ters.</p>
    <p>But MOE’s move can help spark greater aware­ness and con­ver­sa­tions about the boxes, which are ar­guably not well un­der­stood by the pub­lic. This is be­cause their ex­is­tence in games is usu­ally not made clear.</p>
    <p>It is heart­en­ing that the Na­tional Coun­cil on Prob­lem Gam­bling has stepped up ef­forts to ed­u­cate the pub­lic on the po­ten­tial con­nec­tion be­tween loot boxes and gam­bling.</p>
    <p>Cou­pling this with MOE’s planned move next year, there is more hope that young peo­ple and par­ents will be bet­ter in­formed and can take steps to pro­tect those sus­cep­ti­ble to the psy­cho­log­i­cal tricks the boxes em­ploy.</p>
    <p>As a Hawai­ian states­man once said of a Star Wars game that prompted global furore in 2017 over loot boxes: “It’s a trap.”</p>
