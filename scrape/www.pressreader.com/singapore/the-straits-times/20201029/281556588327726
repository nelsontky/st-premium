    <p>In­done­sia’s Vice-Pres­i­dent Ma’ruf Amin has spo­ken up against an Is­lam­o­pho­bic nar­ra­tive un­der­ly­ing French Pres­i­dent Em­manuel Macron’s re­cent de­nun­ci­a­tion of rad­i­cal Is­lamists af­ter the be­head­ing of a teacher in Paris. The ver­sion of Is­lam found in In­done­sia is mod­er­ate in prac­tice and al­lows for peo­ple of dif­fer­ent faiths to live side by side, Mr Ma’ruf said in com­ments de­liv­ered through his spokesman.</p>
    <p>JAKARTA • In­done­sia’s Vice-Pres­i­dent Ma’ruf Amin has spo­ken up against the per­pet­u­a­tion of an Is­lam­o­pho­bic nar­ra­tive un­der­ly­ing French Pres­i­dent Em­manuel Macron’s re­cent de­nun­ci­a­tion of rad­i­cal Is­lamists.</p>
    <p>“The Vice-Pres­i­dent re­grets the state­ment made by Pres­i­dent Macron that gen­er­alises that all Mus­lims (are alike), with­out ex­am­in­ing the dif­fer­ent teach­ings or whether those who in­ter­pret Is­lam may be in the wrong,” Mr Ma’ruf’s spokesman Mas­duki Baid­lowi told The Jakarta Post on Tues­day.</p>
    <p>Mr Mas­duki, i n quot­ing Mr Ma’ruf, stressed that the ver­sion of Is­lam found in In­done­sia is peace­ful and mod­er­ate in prac­tice, and al­lows for peo­ple of dif­fer­ent faiths to live side by side.</p>
    <p>He ac­knowl­edged, though, that Is­lam­o­pho­bia has con­tin­ued to take hold in Europe and the Amer­i­cas, and that there were “cam­paigns” to re­pro­duce the as­sump­tion that Is­lam is a harm­ful religion.</p>
    <p>“This is a chal­lenge for us in pro­mot­ing a peace­ful and just Is­lam – an Is­lam that is tol­er­ant, can co­ex­ist with an ar­ray of dif­fer­ences, and one that recog­nises hu­man rights and democ­racy,” he said.</p>
    <p>“This is what needs to be in­tro­duced to Euro­pean so­ci­ety.”</p>
    <p>The com­ments come as France grap­ples with the Oct 16 be­head­ing of history teacher Sa­muel Paty af­ter he showed car­toons of Prophet Muham­mad to pupils dur­ing a class dis­cus­sion on free speech.</p>
    <p>Af­ter the in­ci­dent, Mr Macron de­fended free speech and pledged to tackle ex­treme Is­lamism, which he sug­gested is tak­ing over some Mus­lim com­mu­ni­ties in France.</p>
    <p>His com­ments caused out­rage in many Mus­lim-ma­jor­ity coun­tries, which have called for a boy­cott of French prod­ucts. Pro­test­ers across India, Bangladesh, Turkey, Pak­istan and else­where have taken to the streets, and boy­cotts are al­ready un­der way in Kuwait and Qatar.</p>
    <p>In In­done­sia, with the world’s largest Mus­lim pop­u­la­tion, grass­roots Is­lamic or­gan­i­sa­tions con­demned Mr Macron’s com­ments.</p>
    <p>For­eign Min­istry spokesman Teuku Faiza­syah said French Am­bas­sador Olivier Cham­bard was sum­moned on Tues­day.</p>
    <p>“In the meet­ing, the For­eign Min­istry ex­pressed con­dem­na­tion of the state­ment made by Pres­i­dent Macron, which de­means Is­lam as a religion,” he added.</p>
    <p>Mr Macron’s state­ment also drew a strong re­sponse from In­done­sia’s House of Rep­re­sen­ta­tives mem­bers. Among them, United Devel­op­ment Party law­maker Muham­mad Iqbal said it bor­dered on be­ing very dan­ger­ous for spread­ing ha­tred.</p>
    <p>“While we do not agree with such vig­i­lan­tism against the teacher, the French gov­ern­ment should also pun­ish any­one who in­sults the Prophet Muham­mad,” he said, call­ing on the gov­ern­ment to re­con­sider its co­op­er­a­tion with France.</p>
    <p>The French Em­bassy in Jakarta is­sued a state­ment on Mon­day clar­i­fy­ing that it de­fended the na­tional po­si­tion in favour of free­dom of ex­pres­sion, free­dom of religion and the re­jec­tion of calls to hate.</p>
    <p>“(Mr Macron’s) state­ment was aimed against rad­i­cal Is­lamism,” the em­bassy said.</p>
