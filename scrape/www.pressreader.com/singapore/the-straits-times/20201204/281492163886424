    <p>Res­i­dents at two hous­ing blocks in Cle­menti will be the first to take part in a year-long trial of a smart let­ter­box sys­tem by SingPost called PostPal.</p>
    <p>They will get an alert when their mail has ar­rived and col­lect it from a cen­tral vend­ing ma­chine-style unit at the foot of their block in­stead of their tra­di­tional let­ter­boxes.</p>
    <p>Res­i­dents of Block 202 Cle­menti Av­enue 6 will, in a fort­night’s time, be no­ti­fied on their mobile phones when their mail has ar­rived.</p>
    <p>They will also col­lect their mail from a cen­tral vend­ing ma­chinestyle unit at the foot of their block in­stead of their tra­di­tional let­ter­boxes.</p>
    <p>Th­ese Hous­ing Board (HDB) dwellers will be the first in Sin­ga­pore to take part in a year-long trial of a smart let­ter­box sys­tem that SingPost en­vi­sions will re­place tra­di­tional units.</p>
    <p>Called PostPal, each ma­chine will store mail for an en­tire hous­ing block, with items auto-sorted into stor­age slots.</p>
    <p>In­stead of us­ing a key to un­lock their des­ig­nated let­ter­box, res­i­dents will scan a QR code gen­er­ated by the SingPost app to re­trieve their items from the ma­chine.</p>
    <p>Through the app, res­i­dents will be no­ti­fied of mail de­liv­ery and the num­ber of items await­ing col­lec­tion. They can also use the app to au­tho­rise oth­ers to col­lect the mail on their be­half.</p>
    <p>PostPal’s fea­tures will re­duce de­liv­ery mis­takes as well as the post­men’s work­load, SingPost said yes­ter­day when an­nounc­ing the pub­lic trial.</p>
    <p>In­stead of hav­ing to sort and slot mail into in­di­vid­ual let­ter­boxes, post­men can load items into the ma­chine to be sorted au­to­mat­i­cally. Mail ad­dressed to homes in­volved in the trial will be af­fixed with a data ma­trix code – sim­i­lar to a QR code – that will be scanned by PostPal for sort­ing and no­ti­fi­ca­tion.</p>
    <p>The trial will start with two HDB blocks in Cle­menti: Res­i­dents of Block 202 Cle­menti Av­enue 6 will be­gin us­ing the sys­tem on Dec 18, while those in Block 205 will fol­low in the weeks ahead.</p>
    <p>PostPal is a newer it­er­a­tion of the smart let­ter­box pro­to­type un­veiled by SingPost last year. It was de­vel­oped in col­lab­o­ra­tion with PBA Group, a robotics and au­to­ma­tion firm head­quar­tered in Sin­ga­pore. The stor­age mod­ules in PostPal units can be cus­tomised to the mail pro­file of each in­di­vid­ual block, SingPost said.</p>
    <p>A block that sees con­sis­tently high e-commerce vol­umes, for ex­am­ple, can have smaller mod­ules in its PostPal re­placed with larger ones that can ac­com­mo­date big­ger postal pack­ages, it added. This con­fig­u­ra­tion can also be made dur­ing the year-end on­line sale peak season.</p>
    <p>The postal ser­vice provider has said that tra­di­tional let­ter­box units are not equipped to meet the grow­ing de­mands of e-commerce, es­pe­cially since smaller items are of­ten sent by mail in­stead of courier ser­vices, which can be more ex­pen­sive.</p>
    <p>Mr Vin­cent Phang, SingPost’s Sin­ga­pore head and chief ex­ec­u­tive of postal ser­vices, told the me­dia at PostPal’s un­veil­ing yes­ter­day that the sys­tem will pro­vide added se­cu­rity as only post­men will have ac­cess to the ma­chine’s mail de­posit, and each ma­chine will have a closed-cir­cuit tele­vi­sion camera.</p>
    <p>When asked about ac­ces­si­bil­ity for the less tech-savvy, he said those with­out smart­phones can use a one-time pass­word sent by SMS to re­trieve their mail.</p>
    <p>SingPost and grass­roots vol­un­teers will be en­gag­ing res­i­dents in the lead-up to PostPal’s launch, Mr Phang said, adding that pub­lic ac­cep­tance will be key to the sys­tem’s suc­cess.</p>
    <p>“We do ac­knowl­edge that there may be some ap­pre­hen­sion in some peo­ple at the start, but we will work through those is­sues.”</p>
    <p>The PostPal trial will be pro­gres­sively rolled out to more precincts, de­pend­ing on the per­for­mance of the units in Cle­menti and ap­proval from the au­thor­i­ties, SingPost said.</p>
    <p>It de­clined to dis­close the cost of the project.</p>
    <p>Mr Foo Kia Jong, a res­i­dent at Block 202, said he is look­ing for­ward to the no­ti­fi­ca­tion fea­tures and flex­i­ble stor­age space of­fered by PostPal.</p>
    <p>His let­ter­box, which he checks once a week, is of­ten stuffed with his chil­dren’s on­line shop­ping or­ders, the 61-year-old said.</p>
    <p>“We don’t know (if there will be) any prob­lems ahead, but we must have the courage to try new things,” said Mr Foo, who is self­em­ployed.</p>
