    <p>Q How does a weaker Sin­ga­pore dol­lar af­fect house­holds and com­pa­nies?</p>
    <p>A In its lat­est mon­e­tary pol­icy state­ment, Sin­ga­pore’s cen­tral bank eased its pol­icy stance by allowing for a weaker ex­change rate. This is in the light of the strong eco­nomic head­winds trig­gered by the Covid-19 pan­demic.</p>
    <p>It is in­deed an im­por­tant ques­tion to ex­am­ine how a weak­en­ing of Sin­ga­pore’s ex­change rate would af­fect house­holds and com­pa­nies.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore is highly trade de­pen­dent. In 2018, the Repub­lic’s ex­ports to gross domestic prod­uct (GDP) ra­tio and imports to GDP ra­tio were ap­prox­i­mately 180 per cent and 150 per cent re­spec­tively.</p>
    <p>The­o­ret­i­cally, a weaker cur­rency would make Sin­ga­pore’s imports more ex­pen­sive while ex­ports to for­eign­ers be­come cheaper. Nonethe­less, not all goods would be af­fected sim­i­larly.</p>
    <p>House­holds may be won­der­ing how a weaker Sing­dol­lar af­fects their favourite sashimi or lat­est Toy­ota car from Ja­pan, while com­pa­nies may ask how it will af­fect their cost of pro­duc­tion and price com­pet­i­tive­ness.</p>
    <p>Our re­cent study shows that im­port and ex­port prices move in the di­rec­tion as sug­gested by the­ory.</p>
    <p>Us­ing data on trade prices and nom­i­nal ef­fec­tive ex­change rates avail­able from the Depart­ment of Statis­tics (SingS­tat) and the In­ter­na­tional Mon­e­tary Fund re­spec­tively, we es­ti­mated the pass-through ef­fects of dif­fer­ent trade in­dus­tries in Sin­ga­pore from 2010 to last year.</p>
    <p>Pass-through ef­fects re­fer to the ex­tent of the change in im­port and ex­port prices, given a change in ex­change rate.</p>
    <p>Nonethe­less, we find that the pass-through ef­fects are in­com­plete. This sug­gests that the im­pact of ex­change rate fluc­tu­a­tions is not fully trans­lated into trade prices.</p>
    <p>More­over, there are vast het­ero­ge­neous ef­fects across in­dus­tries in which im­port and ex­port prices re­spond dif­fer­ently to ex­change rate changes.</p>
    <p>To see how house­holds and com­pa­nies are af­fected dif­fer­ently across in­dus­tries, we focus on two in­dus­tries: food and live an­i­mals, as well as ma­chin­ery and trans­port equip­ment.</p>
    <p>FOOD AND LIVE AN­I­MALS</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore­ans love to eat. As most of our edi­ble food prod­ucts are im­ported, there are con­cerns that house­holds will pay a higher price for food as the Sing­dol­lar weakens.</p>
    <p>How­ever, the ex­tent of such an in­crease is de­pen­dent on the mag­ni­tude of the pass-through ef­fect. We es­ti­mate this by study­ing the re­la­tion­ship be­tween the move­ment of trade prices and Sin­ga­pore’s nom­i­nal ef­fec­tive ex­change rate.</p>
    <p>We find a weak im­port pass-through ef­fect of 0.27 in the food and live an­i­mals mar­ket. This im­plies that weak­en­ing the Sin­ga­pore dol­lar by 1 per cent will in­crease the price of im­ported food by 0.27 per cent.</p>
    <p>Con­se­quently, we would ex­pect our sashimi from Ja­pan to see a slight in­crease in price.</p>
    <p>For Sin­ga­pore’s food ex­ports, we find a stronger pass-through ef­fect of 0.71. This sug­gests that for ev­ery 1 per cent the Sin­ga­pore dol­lar weakens by, for­eign coun­tries will pay a price lower by 0.71 per cent.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore’s ex­port­ing com­pa­nies will ex­pe­ri­ence a gain in price com­pet­i­tive­ness as for­eign trad­ing part­ners pay a lower price for Sin­ga­pore’s food ex­ports, such as cof­fee, tea and spices.</p>
    <p>Over­all, ex­porters seem to ben­e­fit more than con­sumers in this in­dus­try.</p>
    <p>How­ever, food and live an­i­mals form only 3 per cent of Sin­ga­pore’s over­all non-oil domestic ex­ports. There­fore, it is un­likely that this in­dus­try will be able to boost Sin­ga­pore’s over­all ex­port value sig­nif­i­cantly from the lat­est pol­icy stance.</p>
    <p>MA­CHIN­ERY AND TRANS­PORT EQUIP­MENT</p>
    <p>Next, we turn to the ma­chin­ery and trans­port equip­ment in­dus­try, Sin­ga­pore’s largest trade in­dus­try, which formed more than 50 per cent of its to­tal trade last year.</p>
    <p>In this in­dus­try, the ex­change rate pass-through to its im­port prices is 0.58. This sug­gests the weak­en­ing of the Sin­ga­pore dol­lar by 1 per cent will in­crease the price of im­ported ma­chin­ery and trans­port equip­ment by 0.58 per cent.</p>
    <p>This is more than twice that of the food and live an­i­mals in­dus­try. Con­se­quently, Toy­ota car buy­ers will feel the im­pact more than sashimi lovers.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to SingS­tat, ma­chin­ery and trans­port equip­ment con­sti­tuted 61 per cent of last year’s non-oil imports. This is due to how Sin­ga­pore heav­ily imports elec­tri­cal ma­chin­ery and elec­tri­cal parts such as trans­mit­ters, diodes and semi­con­duc­tors.</p>
    <p>Thus, the in­crease in im­port prices of this in­dus­try could po­ten­tially drive up Sin­ga­pore’s im­ported inflation.</p>
    <p>Nonethe­less, we be­lieve that this will be mit­i­gated by a weak global de­mand for ma­chin­ery equip­ment in these un­cer­tain times, keep­ing prices down, and should not be a cause for con­cern.</p>
    <p>For ex­ports, the pass-through ef­fect is 0.41, which im­plies that weak­en­ing the Sin­ga­pore dol­lar by 1 per cent will de­crease the price of exported ma­chin­ery and trans­port equip­ment by 0.41 per cent.</p>
    <p>Con­se­quently, com­pa­nies ex­port­ing prod­ucts such as air­craft parts, in­te­grated cir­cuits and tur­bines will gain some price com­pet­i­tive­ness in over­seas mar­kets.</p>
    <p>As this in­dus­try is Sin­ga­pore’s main ex­port driver, the gain in price com­pet­i­tive­ness is likely to boost the over­all ex­port value. This serves as a sup­port for Sin­ga­pore’s tepid eco­nomic growth in view of the global eco­nomic down­turn.</p>
    <p>LOOK­ING FOR­WARD</p>
    <p>These find­ings, how­ever, are based on fig­ures from 2010 to last year and do not con­sider re­cent events. More­over, we have fo­cused only on changes in ex­change rate.</p>
    <p>With the re­cent pan­demic, sup­ply chains and external de­mand have been af­fected in­ter­na­tion­ally. This could have dif­fer­ent im­pacts on the in­dus­tries.</p>
    <p>While there are still many un­cer­tain­ties in fu­ture trade prices and eco­nomic growth, the Gov­ern­ment has adopted dif­fer­ent poli­cies to pre­pare Sin­ga­pore for the road of eco­nomic re­cov­ery. It is im­por­tant to en­vis­age the trans­mis­sion mech­a­nisms of these poli­cies to know how they would af­fect us as a na­tion.</p>
    <p>An un­der­stand­ing of the het­ero­ge­neous im­pacts on dif­fer­ent in­dus­tries from the re­cent change in ex­change rate pol­icy – af­fect­ing things from sashimi to Toy­ota cars – could be the first step for­ward. in­struc­tor at the Depart­ment of Eco­nom­ics at the Na­tional Univer­sity of Sin­ga­pore, from which Dave Chia re­cently grad­u­ated.</p>
