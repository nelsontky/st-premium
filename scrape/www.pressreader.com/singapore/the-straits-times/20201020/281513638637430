    <p>The new Bi­dadari es­tate will have a poly­clinic by 2027, co-lo­cated with a nurs­ing home in Up­per Alju­nied Road.</p>
    <p>It is one of 12 new poly­clin­ics that the Gov­ern­ment is plan­ning to launch by 2030. With the ad­di­tions, Sin­ga­pore will have 32 poly­clin­ics lo­cated around the is­land by then.</p>
    <p>Ex­plain­ing the rea­son for hav­ing the poly­clinic and nurs­ing home in the same lo­ca­tion, Se­nior Min­is­ter of State for Health Janil Puthuc­heary said yes­ter­day that the in­te­grated de­vel­op­ment will also ben­e­fit the pa­tients in Toa Payoh town, “which is a ma­ture es­tate, and there is an in­creas­ing num­ber of se­niors with chronic dis­eases and dis­eases for the aged”.</p>
    <p>Co-lo­cat­ing the nurs­ing home with the poly­clinic will fa­cil­i­tate syn­ergy between the health­care fa­cil­i­ties through the shar­ing of ser­vices to sup­port se­niors and poly­clinic pa­tients as their care needs evolve, said the Min­istry of Health.</p>
    <p>Three other poly­clin­ics that are yet to be opened – in Bukit Pan­jang and Kaki Bukit, as well as a re­de­vel­oped one in Jurong – will also be colo­cated with nurs­ing homes.</p>
    <p>The ser­vices pro­vided at the Bi­dadari poly­clinic will i nclude med­i­cal treat­ment for acute con­di­tions, chronic dis­ease man­age­ment, women and child health ser­vices, al­lied health ser­vices, as well as ra­di­o­log­i­cal, lab­o­ra­tory and phar­macy ser­vices.</p>
    <p>The in­te­grated de­vel­op­ment, which will be op­er­ated by Na­tional Health­care Group Poly­clin­ics, will</p>
    <p>Co-lo­cat­ing the nurs­ing home with the poly­clinic will fa­cil­i­tate syn­ergy between the health­care fa­cil­i­ties through the shar­ing of ser­vices to sup­port se­niors and poly­clinic pa­tients as their care needs evolve, said the Min­istry of Health.</p>
    <p>be sited near the Alkaff Lake­view Hous­ing Board clus­ter. The near­est train stop is Woodleigh sta­tion, about 500m away.</p>
    <p>Dr Janil, who was speak­ing to re­porters dur­ing a visit to Ang Mo Kio Poly­clinic yes­ter­day, said the Bi­dadari poly­clinic will also serve the “many new young fam­i­lies” in the es­tate, which will have about 10,000 HDB flats pro­gres­sively com­pleted by 2022.</p>
    <p>Res­i­dents from the first two new HDB projects in Bi­dadari, in­clud­ing Alkaff Lake­view, started col­lect­ing the keys to their flats in July last year.</p>
    <p>“We will call the ten­der (for the new poly­clinic) later this year, and get the process go­ing for con­sul­tancy and de­sign, and we hope to have it op­er­a­tional by 2027,” said Dr Janil, who is also Se­nior Min­is­ter of State for Com­mu­ni­ca­tions and In­for­ma­tion.</p>
    <p>He also spoke about the team­based care model that has to be con­sid­ered to­gether with in­fec­tion con­trol when build­ing health­care fa­cil­i­ties.</p>
    <p>“The Covid-19 pan­demic has made us think about how we do in­fec­tion con­trol, how you might seg­re­gate pa­tients, how you do the pa­tient en­trance, where they walk, where they sit, where they rest,” he said.</p>
    <p>“Far more im­por­tant is the care model, the busi­ness as usual... Here in Ang Mo Kio Poly­clinic, and sub­se­quently in the Bi­dadari poly­clinic, they’ll be us­ing the team­let care model, where a group of pro­fes­sion­als – doc­tors, nurses and care co­or­di­na­tors – will look after, con­sis­tently, the same group of pa­tients over time.”</p>
    <p>Dr Janil said Covid-19 has af­fected the con­struc­tion and de­vel­op­ment of many fa­cil­i­ties, in­clud­ing health­care ones. “We ex­pect there will be im­pact, but I think it’s a bit early to spec­ify ex­actly what the im­pact will be,” he said.</p>
    <p>In March, the Gov­ern­ment said it will open poly­clin­ics in Bukit Pan­jang, Eunos and Kal­lang this year, and one in Sem­bawang next year.</p>
    <p>An­other six will open by 2026, in Tampines North, Khatib, Seran­goon, Kaki Bukit, Ten­gah and Yew Tee. An­other one will open in Bis­han by 2030.</p>
