    <p>The re­newed lock­downs in the United States and Europe in the wake of new waves of Covid-19, as well as the tight­en­ing of re­stric­tions in Hong Kong, Malaysia, Ja­pan and Tai­wan, are a re­minder that even af­ter rag­ing for more than a year, the pan­demic is far from over. The roll-out of vac­cines should help con­tain the spread, but that will be a pro­longed process. It will not be un­til well into the se­cond half of 2021, at best, that the pan­demic may pos­si­bly be brought un­der con­trol. In th­ese cir­cum­stances, economies will need con­tin­ued fis­cal sup­port from gov­ern­ments. US law­mak­ers agreed on a new US$900 bil­lion (S$1.2 tril­lion) pack­age of re­lief mea­sures – which Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump has now re­jected – on top of the more than US$2 tril­lion passed ear­lier. This would have brought the to­tal fis­cal sup­port this year to more than 13 per cent of gross do­mes­tic prod­uct. The in­com­ing ad­min­is­tra­tion of pres­i­dent-elect Joe Bi­den has pledged even more stimulus next year.</p>
    <p>Many Euro­pean coun­tries which are reel­ing from re­peated lock­downs will also al­most cer­tainly need to step up fis­cal as­sis­tance from al­ready record lev­els. In Oc­to­ber, the In­ter­na­tional Mone­tary Fund cau­tioned that one of the big­gest risks in re­spond­ing to the eco­nomic im­pact of the pan­demic would be a pre­ma­ture with­drawal of fis­cal sup­port. That is even more true now.</p>
    <p>It also ap­plies to Sin­ga­pore. Al­though the Gov­ern­ment has pledged close to $100 bil­lion in spend­ing in re­sponse to the pan­demic – equal to about 20 per cent of GDP – and is likely to run a record fis­cal deficit of more than 15 per cent of GDP this fi­nan­cial year, there is a case for con­tin­ued fis­cal sup­port. With the econ­omy start­ing to re­cover, this would need to be care­fully tar­geted. For ex­am­ple, while there is no case for pro­vid­ing broad-based wage sub­si­dies, the Jobs Sup­port Scheme which ta­pers off in March may need to be ex­tended for sec­tors likely to re­main hard hit, such as avi­a­tion and tourism-re­lated sec­tors, the prospects for which are still bleak.</p>
    <p>The Jobs Growth In­cen­tive, un­der which the Gov­ern­ment co-pays salaries of new lo­cal hires and which will ex­pire in Fe­bru­ary, may also need to be se­lec­tively ex­tended. And with un­em­ploy­ment likely to re­main high, the Covid-19 Sup­port Grant – which pro­vides tem­po­rary as­sis­tance to those who suf­fer in­vol­un­tary job and in­come losses, and ap­pli­ca­tions for which end on Dec 31 – will need to be car­ried over into 2021.</p>
    <p>On top of pro­vid­ing re­liefs, the Gov­ern­ment must also con­tinue to main­tain pub­lic in­vest­ments in health, ed­u­ca­tion, train­ing and green in­fra­struc­ture, which can be both job cre­at­ing and boost sus­tain­abil­ity and re­silience in the econ­omy. There will come a time when the Gov­ern­ment will need to re­build its fis­cal po­si­tion. But for now, fight­ing the im­pact of Covid-19 must con­tinue to be the pri­or­ity.</p>
