    <p>PARIS • World pow­ers have a duty to sup­port the Le­banese peo­ple af­ter a mas­sive blast dev­as­tated their cap­i­tal as the coun­try’s fu­ture is at stake, French Pres­i­dent Em­manuel Macron told an emer­gency donors con­fer­ence yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Le­banese pro­test­ers en­raged by of­fi­cial neg­li­gence blamed for the ex­plo­sion, mean­while, vowed yes­ter­day to rally again af­ter a night of street clashes i n which they stormed sev­eral min­istries.</p>
    <p>Sep­a­rately, In­for­ma­tion Min­is­ter Manal Ab­del Sa­mad said she was re­sign­ing, cit­ing the blast and the fail­ure of the govern­ment to carry out re­forms.</p>
    <p>Le­banon’s debt-laden econ­omy was al­ready mired in cri­sis and reel­ing from the coro­n­avirus pan­demic be­fore the port ex­plo­sion, which killed 158 peo­ple. But for­eign gov­ern­ments are wary about writ­ing blank cheques to a govern­ment per­ceived by its own peo­ple to be deeply cor­rupt.</p>
    <p>In open­ing re­marks to the on­line donor con­fer­ence he co-or­gan­ised, Mr Macron said the in­ter­na­tional re­sponse should be co­or­di­nated by the United Na­tions in Le­banon. “Our task to­day is to act swiftly and ef­fi­ciently, to co­or­di­nate our aid on the ground so that this aid goes as quickly as pos­si­ble to the Le­banese peo­ple,” he said via video-link from his sum­mer re­treat on the French Riviera.</p>
    <p>Pres­i­dent Macron also said the of­fer of as­sis­tance in­cluded sup­port for an im­par­tial, cred­i­ble and in­de­pen­dent in­quiry into last Tuesday’s blast, which has prompted some Le­banese to call for a re­volt to top­ple their po­lit­i­cal lead­ers.</p>
    <p>The ex­plo­sion gut­ted en­tire neigh­bour­hoods, leav­ing 250,000 peo­ple home­less, raz­ing busi­nesses and de­stroy­ing crit­i­cal grain sup­plies.</p>
    <p>Re­build­ing Beirut will likely run into bil­lions of dol­lars. Economists forecast the blast could wipe up to 25 per cent off the coun­try’s gross do­mes­tic prod­uct.</p>
    <p>Many Le­banese are an­gry at the govern­ment’s re­sponse and say the dis­as­ter high­lighted the neg­li­gence of a cor­rupt po­lit­i­cal elite.</p>
    <p>Pro­test­ers stormed govern­ment min­istries in Beirut and trashed the of­fices of the As­so­ci­a­tion of Banks in Le­banon on Satur­day.</p>
    <p>The same day, Prime Min­is­ter Has­san Diab said he would call for early elec­tions, adding that he would re­main in of­fice for two months to give change a chance.</p>
    <p>Chris­tian Ma­ronite Pa­tri­arch Bechara Boutros al-Rai said the Cab­i­net should re­sign as it can­not “change the way it gov­erns”.</p>
    <p>Mr Macron vis­ited Beirut last Thursday, the first world leader to do so af­ter the ex­plo­sion, and promised hu­man­i­tar­ian aid would come but that pro­found po­lit­i­cal re­form was needed to re­solve the coun­try’s prob­lems and se­cure longer term sup­port.</p>
    <p>“I guar­an­tee you, this (re­con­struc­tion) aid will not go to cor­rupt hands,” Mr Macron told the throngs who greeted him.</p>
    <p>There has been an out­pour­ing of sym­pa­thy for Le­banon from around the world this past week and many coun­tries have sent im­me­di­ate hu­man­i­tar­ian sup­port such as med­i­cal sup­plies, but there has been an ab­sence of aid com­mit­ments so far.</p>
    <p>Mr Macron said the global com­mu­nity had a duty to help. “Our role is to be by their sides,” he said. “Le­banon’s fu­ture is at stake.” A Macron aide on Satur­day de­clined to set a tar­get for the con­fer­ence. Emer­gency aid was needed for re­con­struc­tion, food aid, med­i­cal equip­ment and schools and hospi­tals, the of­fi­cial said.</p>
    <p>Is­rael and Iran were not tak­ing part in the video-link con­fer­ence, the El­y­see Palace of­fi­cial said.</p>
    <p>US Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump, who yes­ter­day par­tic­i­pated in the con­fer­ence, on Satur­day tweeted: “Ev­ery­one wants to help!”</p>
