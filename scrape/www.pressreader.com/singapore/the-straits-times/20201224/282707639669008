    <p>Lo­cal broad­caster Me­di­a­corp has apol­o­gised af­ter three of its artists – Jef­frey Xu, Shane Pow and Ter­ence Cao – were caught in what looked like a breach of Covid-19 reg­u­la­tions.</p>
    <p>A Shin Min Daily News reader tipped off the Chi­nese-lan­guage pub­li­ca­tion on Wed­nes­day that Xu, who cel­e­brated his 32nd birth­day on Oct 3, had posted an In­sta­gram story of a large gath­er­ing. The at­ten­dees in­cluded other celebri­ties like Jeremy Chan and Julie Tan, who are not man­aged by Me­di­a­corp.</p>
    <p>The pic­ture, re­port­edly up­loaded on Oct 3, showed 13 peo­ple in one pho­to­graph in what looked like some­one’s res­i­dence, with Xu hold­ing a cake.</p>
    <p>No one was wear­ing a mask. Me­di­a­corp said in a state­ment to Shin Min that it has checked with the three stars un­der its man­age­ment – Xu, Cao and Pow – and con­firmed that they were at the gath­er­ing, which took place in Oc­to­ber. It said the three “deeply re­gret” their ac­tions and apol­o­gise for their mis­takes.</p>
    <p>In an up­dated state­ment to The Straits Times, Me­di­a­corp said 987FM dee­jay So­nia Chew was also at the gath­er­ing.</p>
    <p>The broad­caster added it takes safe dis­tanc­ing and Covid-19 reg­u­la­tions se­ri­ously and re­minded its artists to fol­low such rules in both their pro­fes­sional and per­sonal ca­pac­i­ties.</p>
    <p>Cur­rent Covid-19 reg­u­la­tions stip­u­late that so­cial gath­er­ings have to be lim­ited to groups of five out­side the home and that house­holds may re­ceive up to five vis­i­tors at any one time.</p>
