    <p>An­glo Chi­nese School In­de­pen­dent grad­u­ate John Thng Wen Cong has been adept at jug­gling his stud­ies and ac­tiv­i­ties, in­clud­ing run­ning pro­grammes to help needy chil­dren, or­gan­is­ing fundrais­ers and mak­ing time for hob­bies.</p>
    <p>He found out that he scored 44/45 for his In­ter­na­tional Bac­calau­re­ate as­sess­ment when he re­ceived his re­sults yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The 19-year-old strug­gled to bal­ance his com­mit­ments at first, but even­tu­ally did so with the help of a strict sched­ule and guid­ance from his teach­ers and peers.</p>
    <p>In 2018, the teenager and two of his good friends founded The Youth Col­lec­tive – a so­cial en­ter­prise aimed at nur­tur­ing chil­dren in need and em­pow­er­ing youth to be­come proac­tive in so­cial work.</p>
    <p>He said: “I was in­spired to help chil­dren in need while vol­un­teer­ing in Meet-the-Peo­ple ses­sions in 2017. I felt that chil­dren suf­fered the most when a fam­ily is in dis­tress.”</p>
    <p>He re­counted how the three friends’ lack of ex­pe­ri­ence, for­mal qual­i­fi­ca­tions and aca­demic work­load led to difficulty in con­vinc­ing or­gan­i­sa­tions to sup­port their idea as well as a lot of late nights.</p>
    <p>They were grate­ful that their teach­ers gave them con­fi­dence to pur­sue their vi­sion de­spite the chal­lenges, and helped them to keep up with their stud­ies.</p>
    <p>His work is funded by Al­liance Health­care as a cor­po­rate so­cial en­ter­prise. It runs weekly men­tor­ship ses­sions at a neigh­bour­hood pri­mary school and a com­mu­nity soc­cer clinic.</p>
    <p>The teenager said: “What the chil­dren need most is some­one to make them feel im­por­tant and be pos­i­tive role mod­els.”</p>
    <p>He has also been in­volved in other ini­tia­tives, in­clud­ing lead­ing a team of youth vol­un­teers to dis­trib­ute masks and hand sani­tiser amid the pan­demic, and or­gan­is­ing a triathlon in 2019 to raise funds and aware­ness for the Sin­ga­pore Chil­dren’s So­ci­ety.</p>
    <p>His team raised more than $5,000 that year.</p>
    <p>Mr Thng is also an avid pho­tog­ra­pher, as the hobby not only serves to re­lieve stress but also to in­spire more youth to join his en­ter­prise.</p>
    <p>He takes pho­tos of the ac­tiv­i­ties he and his friends run and presents them to ACSI ju­niors to show how they can play an ac­tive role in help­ing the com­mu­nity.</p>
    <p>Mr Thng hopes to ex­pand his so­cial en­ter­prise by col­lab­o­rat­ing with more pri­mary schools, and see more youth show ini­tia­tive in giv­ing back to the com­mu­nity.</p>
    <p>He also hopes to pur­sue a med­i­cal de­gree, and ex­plore help­ing the com­mu­nity in the med­i­cal field.</p>
