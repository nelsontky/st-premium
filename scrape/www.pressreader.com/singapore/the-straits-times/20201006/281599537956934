    <p>Elder­care fa­cil­i­ties, hawker cen­tres (right), schools and other high-risk premises will have to de­velop and im­ple­ment an en­vi­ron­men­tal san­i­ta­tion pro­gramme next year un­der the new En­vi­ron­men­tal Pub­lic Health (Amend­ment) Bill, which was passed in Par­lia­ment yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Elder­care fa­cil­i­ties, hawker cen­tres, schools and other high-risk premises will have to de­velop and im­ple­ment an en­vi­ron­men­tal san­i­ta­tion pro­gramme in 2021.</p>
    <p>This will in­clude thor­ough clean­ing at least ev­ery six months, daily clean­ing of toi­lets and lifts, and a pest man­age­ment plan.</p>
    <p>These are some of the new manda­tory san­i­ta­tion stan­dards in the En­vi­ron­men­tal Pub­lic Health (Amend­ment) Bill, which was passed in Par­lia­ment yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The Bill seeks to raise Sin­ga­pore’s gen­eral stan­dards of hy­giene and in­stil a na­tional cul­ture of keep­ing the coun­try clean, which will help in the fight against fu­ture dis­ease out­breaks here.</p>
    <p>Pre­sent­ing the Bill for de­bate, Min­is­ter for Sus­tain­abil­ity and the En­vi­ron­ment Grace Fu noted that de­spite Sin­ga­pore’s rep­u­ta­tion as a clean and green city, there is still room for im­prove­ment.</p>
    <p>She cited the re­sults of a sur­vey by the Sin­ga­pore Man­age­ment Univer­sity (SMU) that was re­leased last month which found that one in five peo­ple thought it ac­cept­able to leave rub­bish around if there was al­ready lit­ter in the area.</p>
    <p>“Clearly, we still have some way to go to in­cul­cate a strong sense of so­cial re­spon­si­bil­ity in Sin­ga­pore­ans to do their part to keep pub­lic spa­ces clean,” said Ms Fu.</p>
    <p>She added that the Covid-19 pan­demic un­der­scores the need for high stan­dards of san­i­ta­tion and hy­giene.</p>
    <p>“Covid-19 will not be the last global pan­demic that we have to face. We must shore up our pub­lic health de­fences and be ready to con­tain emerg­ing out­breaks when they come,” she said.</p>
    <p>Un­der the new Bill, higher-risk premises with high foot­fall or vul­ner­a­ble oc­cu­pants such as pre-schools, youth fa­cil­i­ties, elder­care fa­cil­i­ties, hawker cen­tres and cof­fee shops have to de­velop and roll out an en­vi­ron­men­tal san­i­ta­tion pro­gramme.</p>
    <p>The pro­gramme has to in­clude the fol­low­ing:</p>
    <p>First, toi­lets, lifts, bin cen­tres and high-touch sur­faces must be cleaned at least once a day.</p>
    <p>Sec­ond, thor­ough clean­ing of ar­eas that are not eas­ily ac­ces­si­ble and not cov­ered by rou­tine clean­ing – such as out-of-reach win­dow pan­els and wall fans – has to be car­ried out at least once ev­ery six months.</p>
    <p>Third, a pest man­age­ment plan must be put in place, along with clean­ing and dis­in­fect­ing pro­ce­dures to han­dle in­ci­dents like when a per­son vom­its on the premises.</p>
    <p>Fourth, the premises have to meet tar­gets like en­sur­ing the area is rel­a­tively free of stains and en­vi­ron­men­tal waste.</p>
    <p>Fi­nally, work­ers must be trained and pro­vided with the nec­es­sary equip­ment to carry out ef­fec­tive clean­ing and dis­in­fec­tion.</p>
    <p>The re­spon­si­bil­ity of de­vel­op­ing and im­ple­ment­ing such a pro­gramme will fall on premise man­agers and en­vi­ron­men­tal con­trol co­or­di­na­tors or en­vi­ron­men­tal con­trol of­fi­cers, who will be ap­pointed by the premise man­agers. The Na­tional En­vi­ron­ment Agency (NEA) said yes­ter­day it is cur­rently de­vel­op­ing cour­ses to train these of­fi­cers and co­or­di­na­tors.</p>
    <p>About 2,630 pre-schools, schools, youth fa­cil­i­ties and elder­care and dis­abil­ity fa­cil­i­ties are ex­pected to im­ple­ment these changes by the mid­dle of next year.</p>
    <p>Around 1,240 hawker cen­tres and cof­fee shops have un­til the end of next year to meet the new re­quire­ments.</p>
    <p>The NEA will study whether the regime needs to be ex­panded to other types of premises in fu­ture.</p>
    <p>Said Ms Fu: “This Bill marks an­other mile­stone in our ef­forts to keep Sin­ga­pore clean and safe... Through col­lec­tive ac­tion and coown­er­ship, we will forge a cleaner, stronger and kin­der Sin­ga­pore for gen­er­a­tions to come.”</p>
