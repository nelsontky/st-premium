    <p>OR­LANDO (Florida) • LeBron James be­lieves an ab­sence of locker-room jeal­ousy is the key to his suc­cess­ful part­ner­ship with An­thony Davis, as the Los An­ge­les Lak­ers bear down on a record-equalling 17th Na­tional Bas­ket­ball As­so­ci­a­tion (NBA) cham­pi­onship.</p>
    <p>Davis joined the Lak­ers last year from the New Or­leans Pel­i­cans, and has played a cru­cial role in guid­ing them back to the NBA Fi­nals for the first time in 10 years af­ter miss­ing the play-offs in 2018-2019.</p>
    <p>On Wed­nes­day, he ex­celled with 34 points, nine re­bounds and five as­sists as the Lak­ers de­mol­ished the Mi­ami Heat 116-98 in Game 1.</p>
    <p>James, mean­while, added 25 points, 13 re­bounds and nine as­sists against his for­mer team to open the best-of-seven se­ries.</p>
    <p>The James-Davis dou­ble act has pro­vided the Lak­ers with t he team’s most po­tent axis since Kobe Bryant and Shaquille O’Neal were lead­ing the team to three con­sec­u­tive NBA ti­tles be­tween 2000 and 2002.</p>
    <p>But, while the late Bryant and O’Neal’s re­la­tion­ship was un­der­cut with ten­sion, James says his part­ner­ship with Davis is dif­fer­ent.</p>
    <p>“We’re not jeal­ous of each other,” he said on Thurs­day ahead of yes­ter­day’s Game 2. “I think that’s the best thing. In pro­fes­sional sports, you have guys that join forces to be­come al­pha males. That’s what they call them.</p>
    <p>“Two guys that have been dom­i­nant in a spe­cific sport on their own re­spec­tive teams, and they get to­gether and they talk about how dom­i­nant they can be...</p>
    <p>“I be­lieve jeal­ousy creeps in a lot. And that is the ab­so­lute con­trary of what we are. We know who we are. We know what we’re about. We want the best, ev­ery day, both on and off the floor, for one an­other.”</p>
    <p>Davis, 27, agreed, say­ing he had never once con­sid­ered the pos­si­bil­ity that envy could desta­bilise the Lak­ers’ locker room.</p>
    <p>“I’m not jeal­ous of him. He’s not jeal­ous of me,” he said. “When you’ve got two guys who are very self­less and want to win as bad as both of us want to, the rest just takes care of it­self.”</p>
    <p>Davis said a free flow of ideas and opin­ions char­ac­terised his part­ner­ship with James, adding: “When we watch films or even dur­ing the course of a game, if I did some­thing wrong, he tells me. If he does some­thing wrong, I tell him.</p>
    <p>“I think that’s what makes it work, know­ing that we trust one an­other to make reads, to make calls.”</p>
    <p>Davis, how­ever, does ad­mit to en­vy­ing James’ three NBA cham­pi­onship rings.</p>
    <p>“I want a ring, and he has three of them,” he said. “Hope­fully I don’t have to be en­vi­ous of that much longer.”</p>
    <p>Mi­ami point guard Go­ran Dragic, who suf­fered a torn plan­tar fas­cia to his left foot in Game 1, and for­ward Bam Ade­bayo, who suf­fered a neck strain, are both doubt­ful for Game 2.</p>
