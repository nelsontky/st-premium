    <p>Ian Ang doesn’t do busi­ness lunches and he’s not mak­ing an ex­cep­tion for this in­ter­view. His public re­la­tions peo­ple have not been able to tell me why he wants to meet over tea in­stead.</p>
    <p>When we meet, the 28-year-old co-founder and CEO of gam­ing chair com­pany Se­cret­lab ex­plains that a full meal means he won’t be able to con­cen­trate later.</p>
    <p>He usu­ally has lunch in his of­fice too, and prefers to keep to this.</p>
    <p>“I try to eat very few carbs for lunch to avoid food coma so I can con­tinue work­ing after,” he says.</p>
    <p>“I eat the same thing every day. Cod­fish and chicken teriyaki, and just a lit­tle bit of rice. I don’t want to de­vi­ate from this daily pro­duc­tive rou­tine, hence I don’t have busi­ness lunches on week­days.”</p>
    <p>So here I am, at Star­bucks in Tekka Place at 3pm on the eve of Deep­avali. Traf­fic in the area is jammed up.</p>
    <p>A few of his peo­ple have come early to make sure we have seats. He ar­rives soon after, hav­ing taken a taxi from the Se­cret­lab of­fice in the Ben­de­meer in­dus­trial es­tate nearby.</p>
    <p>In 2014, when he was 22, Mr Ang had an idea of pro­duc­ing a chair that com­puter gamers like him­self needed. He roped in fel­low gamer Alaric Choo, and they set up Se­cret­lab the next year.</p>
    <p>It has since sold more than one mil­lion chairs in more than 60 coun­tries.</p>
    <p>When Te­masek sub­sidiary Heli­co­nia Cap­i­tal Man­age­ment took a mi­nor­ity stake in it in Au­gust last year, the com­pany was val­ued at be­tween $200 mil­lion and $300 mil­lion.</p>
    <p>Public records show that Mr Ang owns a 70 per cent stake. Mr Choo, 32, has 25 per cent.</p>
    <p>In con­trast to other hyped-up start-ups, Se­cret­lab has been prof­itable from its early days.</p>
    <p>Its chairs, priced from $499 for syn­thetic leather to about $1,000 for leather de­signs, have re­ceived good re­views for com­fort and back sup­port from tech sites like PC Gamer and CNet.</p>
    <p>Un­like bor­ing, func­tional ver­sions in the mar­ket, Se­cret­lab scores high on de­sir­abil­ity with its col­lab­o­ra­tions with brands like HBO’s Game Of Thrones.</p>
    <p>Covid-19’s work-from-home move­ment has also been a boon. It has­tened the brand’s move from gam­ing chair to some­thing any­one could use.</p>
    <p>Rev­enue this year, the com­pany says, is on track to ex­ceed</p>
    <p>$350 mil­lion.</p>
    <p>Ear­lier this month, Mr Ang was named Sin­ga­pore’s EY En­tre­pre­neur Of The Year by pro­fes­sional ser­vices or­gan­i­sa­tion EY, beat­ing more ex­pe­ri­enced busi­ness­men.</p>
    <p>Among other things, the judg­ing panel spoke of how he “dis­plays the busi­ness acu­men of a sea­soned en­tre­pre­neur”, de­spite his youth.</p>
    <p>AS­SURED AIR</p>
    <p>Like in public­ity pho­tos I’ve seen of him, Mr Ang is well groomed in per­son, with thick, coiffed hair and neat eye­brows. He could pass off as a Me­di­a­corp ac­tor.</p>
    <p>He’s wear­ing an all-dark en­sem­ble, in­clud­ing what is be­com­ing a trade­mark cardi­gan.</p>
    <p>I find out later that it is a</p>
    <p>Tom Ford cash­mere de­sign that Mr Choo gave him one Christ­mas. He liked it so much, he bought two more and wears the cardi­gan al­most every day.</p>
    <p>We queue up to or­der, and when our turn comes, I get a chai latte and a red velvet cake.</p>
    <p>He gets a green tea latte and asks for a red velvet cake too.</p>
    <p>Sorry, says the cashier, only one slice left.</p>
    <p>You have it, I say. No, you have it, he replies. I con­cede, and he gets a New York cheese­cake in­stead.</p>
    <p>We head back to our high ta­ble flanked by bar stools.</p>
    <p>While you don’t do lunch, you do do tea, I ask him.</p>
    <p>Yes, he says. In fact, he had wanted to meet at a cafe called Blooms­bury Bak­ers in Ben­de­meer.</p>
    <p>“They are a very small cafe but their cakes are re­ally amaz­ing and their cof­fee is pretty good,” he says.</p>
    <p>Hav­ing our in­ter­view there would mean the cafe gets fea­tured in The Sun­day Times, and he liked the idea of giv­ing a lo­cal busi­ness public­ity.</p>
    <p>But the down­side was that with safe dis­tanc­ing mea­sures, it would be a tight squeeze if all of us – video and photo teams on my side and his PR peo­ple – con­verged on the cafe.</p>
    <p>“Other cus­tomers wouldn’t be able to go in. I don’t want to trou­ble them also,” he says.</p>
    <p>So he de­cides to meet at Star­bucks, which he also likes.</p>
    <p>“A lot of peo­ple think that maybe Star­bucks is a waste of money and whatnot. I think that’s not true. I’m pay­ing for the con­sis­tency, and that it­self has value. You never have to worry about it tast­ing dif­fer­ent.”</p>
    <p>He has a like­able, down-to-earth air and an­swers ques­tions pa­tiently. His man­ner is as­sured but not ar­ro­gant. In fact, there’s a hint of vul­ner­a­bil­ity – maybe it’s his youth – like when he be­comes more self-con­scious once the video cam­era starts rolling.</p>
    <p>But be­hind the dim­pled smile, there’s no doubt a killer in­stinct, dis­ci­pline, and some­thing of a per­fec­tion­ist streak.</p>
    <p>“We would rather die than fail,” he says at one point when talk­ing about how he and Mr Choo ap­proach the busi­ness.</p>
    <p>At work, I am told, he talks to his staff about “de­lib­er­ate prac­tice”,</p>
    <p>that is, to keep go­ing at what­ever you are do­ing un­til it is per­fect.</p>
    <p>Even in his per­sonal habits, he dis­plays a cal­cu­lated fas­tid­i­ous­ness.</p>
    <p>He’s not hav­ing cof­fee dur­ing our in­ter­view be­cause he’s had his day’s quota, I find out.</p>
    <p>“Cof­fee is a pro­duc­tive tool for me. Four hours of fo­cus,” he says. “But I’m also aware not to be ad­dicted and build a tol­er­ance to it, so I limit it to a cup a day.”</p>
    <p>At a photo shoot later when we ad­journ to his Ben­de­meer of­fice, he takes care to make sure there is no lint on his clothes when the pic­ture is taken.</p>
    <p>HOOKED ON GAM­ING</p>
    <p>He grew up in the Sem­bawang area, the younger of two chil­dren.</p>
    <p>His par­ents run a car work­shop in Yishun with a branch in Ang Mo Kio. His sis­ter, older by two years, is a dig­i­tal mar­ket­ing man­ager at a watch com­pany.</p>
    <p>Be­cause his par­ents were busy work­ing, he was looked after by an aunt and spent most of his child­hood at her flat in Chong Pang.</p>
    <p>He at­tended Chongfu Pri­mary School, then Orchid Park Sec­ondary School, in the neigh­bour­hood.</p>
    <p>He wasn’t a good stu­dent. He played soft­ball and foot­ball and was hooked on com­puter games.</p>
    <p>When he was 18, he be­came more se­ri­ous about gam­ing and played the in­di­vid­ual-based game StarCraft II com­pet­i­tively.</p>
    <p>After earn­ing a busi­ness stud­ies diploma at Ngee Ann Polytech­nic, he en­tered na­tional ser­vice, dur­ing which he was a mil­i­tary po­lice­man.</p>
    <p>He stopped gam­ing after NS. “I wanted to be se­ri­ous about life and make some­thing of my­self.”</p>
    <p>He en­rolled in an In­fosys busi­ness de­gree course while work­ing in busi­ness de­vel­op­ment at After­shock, a gam­ing lap­top start-up.</p>
    <p>He dropped out of his course in 2015, soon after Se­cret­lab’s launch.</p>
    <p>Se­cret­lab came about when his par­ents ren­o­vated their house.</p>
    <p>“I was dec­o­rat­ing my room, so I had this whole gam­ing set-up – gam­ing key­board, gam­ing mice, gam­ing PC and all. The only thing miss­ing, I re­alised, was the chair.”</p>
    <p>As a gamer, he knew what he wanted: some­thing he could sit on com­fort­ably for long hours, looks good, has strong wheels and a lo­cal war­ranty.</p>
    <p>Since he couldn’t find such a chair, he de­cided to make one him­self.</p>
    <p>He asked Mr Choo, whom he knew through gam­ing, to join him. A Na­tional Univer­sity of Sin­ga­pore so­ci­ol­ogy grad­u­ate, the lat­ter had founded mod­bot, which cus­tom-paints gam­ing equip­ment.</p>
    <p>“He’s re­ally same-same but dif­fer­ent,” Mr Ang says of his part­ner, who is now chief strat­egy of­fi­cer.</p>
    <p>“On top of that, I knew that he was very good with his hands, good at build­ing stuff and very good with peo­ple. I iden­ti­fied those things as what I wasn’t that great at.”</p>
    <p>Is there ri­valry?</p>
    <p>“There’s no ego be­tween us,” he says.</p>
    <p>When I’m at their of­fice later, I meet the friendly Mr Choo. They seem to have good rap­port.</p>
    <p>They chose the name Se­cret­lab be­cause “se­cret is one of the most al­lur­ing words in the English dic­tionary and lab echoes Alaric’s and my ap­proach – we love R&D”.</p>
    <p>They put in an ini­tial sum of $50,000. Most of it came from sav­ings, and his par­ents also helped with some cash flow.</p>
    <p>“Boot­strap­ping has al­lowed us to make sure we spend ef­fi­ciently and within our means.”</p>
    <p>STAY­ING FO­CUSED</p>
    <p>Two things guided their plan.</p>
    <p>The first was to fo­cus on that one prod­uct – the gam­ing chair – and get it right.</p>
    <p>Gamers were that 1 per cent of ex­treme chair users. At the back of their minds, they knew that if this group found their chairs com­fort­able, oth­ers would too.</p>
    <p>They worked with man­u­fac­tur­ers and took about six months to cre­ate the first pro­to­type. The first 200 units were sold within a week and the chairs got good re­views.</p>
    <p>Mr Ang notes that when they had their early suc­cess, they were</p>
    <p>THE THINK­ING BE­HIND IT</p>
    <p>ONE GREAT PROD­UCT</p>
    <p>We have a golden win­ning prod­uct and in­stead of try­ing to force an­other prod­uct out – that may not be as good, right? – why not ex­pand your cus­tomer base by a hun­dred or a thou­sand times? The world is huge.</p>
    <p>MR IAN ANG, on stay­ing fo­cused on one prod­uct, the gam­ing chair.</p>
    <p>It’s a bit like copy­ing home­work, right? You don’t un­der­stand the think­ing be­hind it, so you miss out a lot of things when you copy it.</p>
    <p>MR IAN ANG, on not be­ing wor­ried about the Se­cret­lab copy­cats that have sprouted.</p>
    <p>asked what new prod­ucts Se­cret­lab would ex­pand to next.</p>
    <p>In­stead, they fo­cused on get­ting new mar­kets for their chairs.</p>
    <p>“We have a golden win­ning prod­uct and in­stead of try­ing to force an­other prod­uct out – that may not be as good, right? – why not ex­pand your cus­tomer base by a hun­dred or a thou­sand times? The world is huge.”</p>
    <p>The sec­ond strat­egy was to mar­ket on­line and di­rect-to-con­sumer. There are no bricks-and-mor­tar Se­cret­lab shops, al­though their of­fice has a show­room.</p>
    <p>Among other things, this al­lows them to by­pass mid­dle­men, avoid ad­di­tional mark-ups, re­spond di­rectly to cus­tomers so they aren’t “bounced back and forth be­tween distrib­u­tors and re­tail­ers”, and also have an over­view of the stock.</p>
    <p>I ask him about on­line com­plaints about some of their syn­thetic leather chairs “peel­ing”.</p>
    <p>He tack­les the is­sue head-on, de­scrib­ing this as one of the most chal­leng­ing as­pects of the busi­ness.</p>
    <p>The peel­ing is re­lated to the trop­i­cal cli­mate of South-east Asia – “hu­mid­ity plus per­spi­ra­tion plus con­stant skin rub­bing”.</p>
    <p>In the early days when they were new in the busi­ness, they had ac­cepted the cer­ti­fi­ca­tion on ma­te­rial abra­sion tests, he says, and also hadn’t con­sid­ered the ef­fects of ex­treme hu­mid­ity.</p>
    <p>The com­pany has been heav­ily in­vest­ing in R&D to im­prove the ma­te­ri­als used and tests con­ducted.</p>
    <p>It has also launched a “Peel Pro­tec­tion Guar­an­tee” and a re­place­ment pro­gramme at sub­sidised rates for the old mod­els in Sin­ga­pore that have the peel­ing prob­lem.</p>
    <p>While prof­its have been com­ing in, Mr Ang wants Se­cret­lab to re­tain its start-up spirit of be­ing in­no­va­tive, tak­ing risks, be­ing ag­ile and run­ning with good ideas no mat­ter who they come from.</p>
    <p>Mr Ang, who is at­tached but does not want to re­veal more, says he and Mr Choo have al­ways be­lieved they would step aside if some­one more ca­pa­ble can lead Se­cret­lab.</p>
    <p>“At the end of the day, it’s just about the com­pany be­ing suc­cess­ful.”</p>
    <p>What does he see him­self do­ing in 10 years’ time when he will be all of 38? Why not cash out now?</p>
    <p>“Ten years is a long time and we don’t plan that far ahead. We like to plan 12 and 36 months ahead as things can change. This year alone, Covid hap­pened,” he says.</p>
    <p>“But, yah, in 10 years’ time I hope to be still run­ning Se­cret­lab.”</p>
