    <p>It is sig­nif­i­cant that the World Eco­nomic Fo­rum (WEF) has de­cided to shift its an­nual meet­ing next May from Switzer­land to Sin­ga­pore. The par­lous Covid-19 sit­u­a­tion in Europe makes an al­ter­na­tive venue nec­es­sary. Ev­i­dently, the WEF’s or­gan­is­ers do not fore­see any im­me­di­ate eas­ing of the re­peated waves of out­breaks which are hit­ting the con­ti­nent. The am­bi­tious scope of a con­fer­ence – which brings the world’s top po­lit­i­cal, busi­ness and aca­demic lead­ers to­gether to dis­cuss the most press­ing of global is­sues – re­quires early and care­ful plan­ning that can­not be left to the mercy of fluc­tu­at­ing in­fec­tion fig­ures. An al­ter­na­tive venue where the coro­n­avi­ral sit­u­a­tion could be ex­pected to re­main sta­ble is nec­es­sary.</p>
    <p>That Sin­ga­pore should have been cho­sen as that venue at­tests to the con­fi­dence which it has earned among ob­servers and in­ter­na­tional in­sti­tu­tions for its han­dling of the pan­demic. It is also apt that the meet­ing in Sin­ga­pore will be the first global lead­er­ship event “to ad­dress world­wide re­cov­ery from the pan­demic”, in the WEF’s words. Since re­cov­ery im­plies a last­ing tran­si­tion from the epi­demi­o­log­i­cal and eco­nomic im­pact of the dis­ease, the hope is that the WEF meet­ing will fo­cus at­ten­tion on places that have man­aged the han­dling of Covid-19 with rel­a­tive suc­cess so that oth­ers can gain use­ful in­sights. Of course, ju­ris­dic­tions such as New Zealand and Tai­wan, too, have done well. But Sin­ga­pore’s record as a venue is bur­nished by the added ad­van­tage of con­nec­tiv­ity that makes it ap­peal­ing to or­gan­is­ers of in­ter­na­tional con­fer­ences. Sin­ga­pore’s cal­i­brated ap­proach to the eas­ing of reg­u­la­tions on mass gath­er­ings has also in­cluded cau­tious ef­forts to re­vive the meet­ings, in­cen­tives, con­ven­tions and ex­hi­bi­tions sec­tor. Th­ese ef­forts bal­ance the com­pet­ing needs of eco­nomic ac­tiv­ity and phys­i­cal safety.</p>
    <p>Pro­to­cols fol­lowed at large-scale meet­ings and con­fer­ences that have al­ready been held here have in­cluded strin­gent on-ar­rival tests, preevent and pe­ri­odic anti­gen test­ing, as well as con­tact trac­ing. Con­se­quently, the hos­pi­tal­ity sec­tor is poised to re­sume its place in Sin­ga­pore’s ap­peal to in­ter­na­tional vis­i­tors. For the WEF event to go smoothly, it is essen­tial that Sin­ga­pore­ans feel safe in­ter­act­ing with th­ese vis­i­tors, they with Sin­ga­pore­ans, and they among them­selves.</p>
    <p>The lo­gis­tics would be de­mand­ing, but Sin­ga­pore has been tested well in the course of this dread­ful year. Lo­cally, it is essen­tial that safe dis­tanc­ing and other pre­ven­tive measures con­tinue to be fol­lowed scrupu­lously so that in­ter­na­tional vis­i­tors can re­tain their con­fi­dence in the coun­try. Since they will be vet­ted on ar­rival, it is also im­por­tant that they en­joy a clean bill of health when they leave – an out­come that can only add to the regard with which Sin­ga­pore is held, and which can help fur­ther its rep­u­ta­tion as a safe place to visit, en­joy and con­duct busi­ness.</p>
