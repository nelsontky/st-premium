    <p>KUALA LUMPUR • Malaysia has long been a place where vast for­tunes have been amassed over time. The Kuoks, Tehs and Queks are cus­to­di­ans of palm oil, prop­erty and bank­ing em­pires that stretch back decades.</p>
    <p>That was un­til Covid-19, when the coun­try’s low-key rub­ber in­dus­try – or more pre­cisely, glove making – be­came one of the hottest on the planet.</p>
    <p>Mr Wong Teek Son, who co­founded Sin­ga­pore-listed River­stone Holdings in the 1980s af­ter work­ing as a re­search chemist, last month be­came the fifth bil­lion­aire in Malaysia from man­u­fac­tur­ing gloves.</p>
    <p>He is now worth US$1.2 bil­lion (S$1.64 bil­lion) as shares of his com­pany ral­lied al­most six­fold from a low in March, thanks to grow­ing de­mand for pro­tec­tive prod­ucts dur­ing the coro­n­avirus pan­demic.</p>
    <p>A River­stone spokesman de­clined to com­ment on Mr Wong’s net worth.</p>
    <p>The speed and strength of the glove boom has been ex­tra­or­di­nary, but there are signs the rapid rise could reverse, espe­cially as re­search pro­gresses for Covid-19 treat­ments and vac­cines.</p>
    <p>Glove com­pa­nies were ham­mered last week when Rus­sia’s pres­i­dent said his na­tion had cleared the world’s first Covid-19 vac­cine for use, while Moderna and John­son & John­son are among those reach­ing deals with gov­ern­ments to sup­ply their shots. River­stone slumped 13 per cent in its worst week since March.</p>
    <p>Even though a vac­cine may not re­sult in lower de­mand for gloves, in­vestors may sell their shares in an­tic­i­pa­tion that a shot will re­duce the num­ber of cases, RHB Re­search In­sti­tute an­a­lyst Alan Lim noted in a re­port last Thurs­day.</p>
    <p>When it comes to glove making, Malaysia is king: It pro­duces about 65 per cent of the world’s sup­ply of rub­ber gloves, and the Plan­ta­tion In­dus­tries and Com­modi­ties Min­istry es­ti­mates ex­ports will climb 45 per cent this year.</p>
    <p>River­stone peers Top Glove and Har­talega Holdings are now among the five most valuable com­pa­nies on Malaysia’s eq­uity bench­mark in­dex. Their shares have jumped more than 192 per cent this year, lift­ing the net worth of their bil­lion­aire founders, ac­cord­ing to the Bloomberg Bil­lion­aires In­dex.</p>
    <p>For­tunes in the coun­try are boom­ing even as the econ­omy has con­tracted by the most since the Asian fi­nan­cial cri­sis. That is ex­ac­er­bat­ing al­ready-wide in­equal­ity.</p>
    <p>Knight Frank es­ti­mates wealth cre­ation there is the 10th fastest in the world, while the mean in­come was RM7,901 (S$2,580) last year. The firm’s 2020 wealth re­port pro­jected that the num­ber of Malaysians with more than $30 mil­lion would swell by 35 per cent be­tween last year and 2024, com­pared with 2 per cent be­tween 2018 and last year.</p>
    <p>The glove in­dus­try’s rise to global dom­i­nance has cre­ated a huge need for for­eign work­ers, lead­ing to con­tro­versy over their treat­ment. The United States last month barred im­ports of prod­ucts from two Top Glove units ow­ing to “rea­son­able ev­i­dence of forced labour”.</p>
    <p>The world’s largest glove pro­ducer said last week that while it is con­tin­u­ing dis­cus­sions with the US, de­mand is pick­ing up in many other coun­tries where Covid-19 out­breaks are resur­fac­ing.</p>
    <p>SIN­GA­PORE LIST­ING</p>
    <p>Un­like its ri­vals, when River­stone de­cided to go pub­lic in 2006, it picked neigh­bour­ing Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>That was be­cause Malaysia had stricter cur­rency con­trols and the funds raised in the city state were more eas­ily trans­fer­able to China and Thai­land, where River­stone was expanding, ac­cord­ing to the com­pany’s spokesman.</p>
    <p>River­stone has an an­nual pro­duc­tion ca­pac­ity of about nine bil­lion gloves, ac­cord­ing to its lat­est an­nual re­port. Its profit more than dou­bled to RM137.5 mil­lion in the first half of the year.</p>
    <p>Mr Wong co-founded the maker of ni­trile gloves in 1989 af­ter work­ing as a re­search and devel­op­ment chemist in a com­pany that sup­plied clean-room prod­ucts. He had not planned to ven­ture into build­ing his own busi­ness.</p>
    <p>“The op­por­tu­nity pre­sented it­self only be­cause the com­pany I worked for shut down, and we were able to use their pro­duc­tion lines,” he said in an in­ter­view with the Sin­ga­pore Ex­change in 2016, adding that with com­pe­ti­tion be­ing rife, many peers in Malaysia had to close down. “We re­alised we needed to pro­vide a ser­vice to our cus­tomers.”</p>
