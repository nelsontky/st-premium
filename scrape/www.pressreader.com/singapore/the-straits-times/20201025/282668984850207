    <p>A surge in new open­ings in the last quar­ter of the year is bring­ing much-needed good news for the strug­gling food and bev­er­age (F&B) scene.</p>
    <p>No fewer than 30 eater­ies have opened since last month, in­clud­ing in the Cen­tral Busi­ness District (CBD), where busi­nesses have been badly hit af­ter work­ers moved home to work.</p>
    <p>And over­seas brands, par­tic­u­larly from foodie des­ti­na­tions Ja­pan and Hong Kong, con­tinue to set up shop here.</p>
    <p>The new eater­ies are a mix of ca­sual din­ing cafes and restau­rants.</p>
    <p>New cafes in­clude a three-storey tea house in Keong Saik by Ja­panese tea cafe Hvala; The Won­der­ment Col­lec­tive in Gey­lang; and Septem­ber in Beauty World Cen­tre.</p>
    <p>Other no­table names in­clude Ja­panese restau­rant Ginza Shinto in Robert­son Quay, seafood-cen­tric restau­rant-bar Cat­fish in Gem­mill Lane and the soon-to-open mul­ti­con­cept diner 8ASH in Ann Siang Hill by the Ebb & Flow Group.</p>
    <p>The 40-seat 8ASH houses Hoshi Hill, which serves Ja­panese food; Amer­i­can-Ja­panese burger brand Mi­rai Burg­ers; and ve­gan con­cept Love Han­dle Burg­ers.</p>
    <p>Since open­ing on Oct 1, Cat­fish, by chef An­drew Walsh of Ir­ish restau­rant Cure, has been full for lunch and din­ner, and the brisk busi­ness has ex­ceeded his ex­pec­ta­tions.</p>
    <p>In th­ese “test­ing times”, his big­gest chal­lenge now is man­power, due to closed bor­ders.</p>
    <p>Although cus­tomers have re­quested for de­liv­ery to re­sume, he says he will do so only when he has enough staff.</p>
    <p>“We have to pace our­selves, do ev­ery­thing at the right time and keep an eye on the econ­omy.”</p>
    <p>His sit­u­a­tion is sim­i­lar to that of many other busi­ness own­ers who se­cured lo­ca­tions early this year and had to de­lay open­ings be­cause of the cir­cuit breaker.</p>
    <p>And even though ren­o­va­tions re­sumed in phase two, the pace of work has been slower than usual, as dif­fer­ent groups of work­ers on site have to fol­low safe-dis­tanc­ing mea­sures.</p>
    <p>Other chal­lenges i nclude t he sup­ply of ingredient­s and man­ag­ing food de­liv­ery.</p>
    <p>And amid the open­ings, clo­sures con­tinue to plague the in­dus­try. To­day is Pic­nic Food Park’s last day of op­er­a­tions at Wisma Atria and French-Ja­panese restau­rant Le Bin­chotan i n Amoy Street will shut­ter on Dec 15.</p>
    <p>But restau­ra­teurs to whom The Sun­day Times spoke re­main cau­tiously hope­ful now that phase three is on the hori­zon.</p>
    <p>Veteran In­dian chef Milind So­vani of Masalaa Bar in East Coast Road, which will open next Sun­day, says: “There’s al­ways a risk with launch­ing new things, but the good thing is that Sin­ga­pore­ans are com­ing out to dine and drink. We have a strong food cul­ture and there are al­ways new op­por­tu­ni­ties.”</p>
    <p>OVER­SEAS CON­CEPTS</p>
    <p>The l ocal F&B scene has also re­ceived an in­jec­tion from pop­u­lar for­eign brands who have set up out­posts here in re­cent months, such as Ja­panese ten­don chain Tem­pura Ten­don Tenya and Dan­ish cookie brand Lecker­baer.</p>
    <p>Join­ing them is Hong Kong’s Cup­ping Room Cof­fee Roast­ers, which opened ear­lier this month at Ngee Ann City, and Ja­pan’s Flip­per’s pan­cakes, which opens next month in the same mall.</p>
    <p>Flip­per’s soft souf­fle pan­cakes are made with Ja­panese pro­duce in­clud­ing milk, Hi­nata eggs from the Kana­gawa pre­fec­ture and “Ki­ta­honami” flour milled from Hokkaido wheat and French but­ter.</p>
    <p>Other Hong Kong brands which have ar­rived re­cently in­clude shabu shabu restau­rant Wagyu More at Bugis Junc­tion and Sy­ohachi Wagyu Ham­burg at One Raf­fles Place.</p>
    <p>Sy­ohachi Wagyu Ham­burg, which opened three weeks ago, is a new con­cept cre­ated for Sin­ga­pore and its sister brand Sy­ohachi Yakiniku opens at Guoco Tower next month.</p>
    <p>The brand gets its beef from its ex­clu­sive part­ner farm Hi­dakami Ranch in Ja­pan’s Miyagi pre­fec­ture.</p>
    <p>The ham­burg con­cept was meant to of­fer a free-flow salad buf­fet with every or­der of a set meal, but that has been put on hold, says Mr Eddy Lau, founder of the Sy­ohachi Group.</p>
    <p>He has big plans for the lo­cal mar­ket – eight to 10 out­lets with the ham­burg con­cept and two more out­lets for the yakiniku brand.</p>
    <p>But it does not in­tend to of­fer de­liv­ery.</p>
    <p>“Some food items just don’t tar pau (take­away) well. Our food is made-to-or­der and best eaten when hot. The qual­ity drops when it is de­liv­ered,” Mr Lau says.</p>
    <p>De­spite the restau­rants be­ing lo­cated in the CBD, he notes that busi­ness is slowly pick­ing up as more work­ers re­turn to the of­fice.</p>
    <p>Sy­ohachi Wagyu Ham­burg is also of­fer­ing an open­ing pro­mo­tion – 50 per cent off for se­lected set meals to­day.</p>
    <p>CBD OPEN­INGS</p>
    <p>Other new F&B out­lets have also popped up in the CBD.</p>
    <p>New-to-mar­ket In­done­sian cof­fee brand Tanam­era Cof­fee, which opened two weeks ago, is buzzing at the new Change Al­ley Mall (for­merly known as Chevron House) in Raf­fles Place.</p>
    <p>The mall opened on Oct 1 and while many of the shops there are still un­der­go­ing ren­o­va­tions, they will open pro­gres­sively over the next few weeks, says a spokesman for prop­erty de­vel­oper Ox­ley Hold­ings, the mall’s as­set man­ager.</p>
    <p>The four-storey mall – which is con­nected to Raf­fles Place MRT sta­tion – was sched­uled to open in the first half of this year, but this was de­layed due to the cir­cuit breaker.</p>
    <p>Seventy per cent of its ten­ants are F&B out­lets, fea­tur­ing fa­mil­iar brands such as Ko­mala’s Restau­rant, Mi­rana Cafe, ra­men restau­rant Kanada-Ya and Waa Cow!, which spe­cialises in beef bowls.</p>
    <p>The spokesman says: “As the Gov­ern­ment eases the na­tion into phase three, we are op­ti­mistic the CBD will be back to its glory days in no time.”</p>
