    <p>Al­though mi­grant worker dor­mi­to­ries with a lower preva­lence of Covid-19 were cleared first, this does not mean that those in dorms with more cases were not taken care of, the Health Min­istry’s direc­tor of med­i­cal ser­vices Ken­neth Mak said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>“There is a dif­fer­ence be­tween test­ing for clear­ing the dorm ver­sus test­ing to make sure that all peo­ple who have in­fec­tions are prop­erly looked af­ter and treated,” he said dur­ing a vir­tual press con­fer­ence yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Those who had acute res­pi­ra­tory in­fec­tions or were at higher risk of be­ing in­fected, such as older work­ers, were prop­erly looked af­ter, with mea­sures in­clud­ing pulling them out of dorms, added As­so­ciate Pro­fes­sor Mak.</p>
    <p>He was re­spond­ing to a ques­tion on whether the strat­egy to clear dorms with fewer cases first had put more work­ers at risk.</p>
    <p>About 94 per cent of the 47,453 con­firmed Covid-19 cases in Sin­ga­pore as of yes­ter­day are dorm res­i­dents.</p>
    <p>Prof Mak said it was eas­ier to clear dorms with a lower preva­lence of the virus first, and that this was part of the in­ter-agency task force’s clear­ing strat­egy. “How­ever, now that we have cleared quite a num­ber of the mi­grant work­ers liv­ing in these dor­mi­to­ries, we are com­ing to the dor­mi­to­ries with higher preva­lence, and they take a lit­tle bit longer to clear,” he said.</p>
    <p>In re­sponse to why the clear­ance process is tak­ing so long, Min­is­ter for Na­tional De­vel­op­ment Lawrence Wong said ef­forts to clear the dorms con­sti­tute a “mas­sive un­der­tak­ing”.</p>
    <p>Some work­ers had to be moved out of the dorms and oth­ers kept within be­cause they were not cleared of the virus yet, he said.</p>
    <p>Mr Wong added that test­ing work­ers in dorms is not a straight­for­ward process. If ev­ery­one tests neg­a­tive in a block, then the en­tire block can be cleared, but “this has not hap­pened”, he said.</p>
    <p>“Nei­ther has it been the case that ev­ery­one tests pos­i­tive be­cause the safe dis­tanc­ing mea­sures do help to slow down the spread of the virus. But that also means that ev­ery time you go into a block, you end up with a cer­tain per­cent­age that are pos­i­tive, a cer­tain per­cent­age who test neg­a­tive.”</p>
    <p>“To deal with that, you have to restart some­times the process of iso­lat­ing the work­ers, an­other 14 days of iso­la­tion, and then it re­peats block af­ter block af­ter block across mul­ti­ple dor­mi­to­ries, across 300,000 work­ers,” he said.</p>
    <p>“It is quite a mas­sive un­der­tak­ing and to be able to com­plete this very soon, I think it is credit to the hard work of ev­ery­one who has been serv­ing on the front line. We would not have been able to do it with­out all their sac­ri­fices.”</p>
    <p>Health Min­is­ter Gan Kim Yong also said that even if a worker has tested neg­a­tive, he would still have to be ob­served for the next 14 days. The worker would have to be tested again be­cause he might be asymp­to­matic.</p>
    <p>“And if it turns out pos­i­tive, then you have to go back­wards, trace back again to see when was he in­fected, whether there were other close con­tacts that you need to ring-fence, you need to quar­an­tine. So, it is quite a pro­tracted process,” said Mr Gan, adding that a com­bi­na­tion of iso­la­tion, serol­ogy and poly­merase chain re­ac­tion tests is used to ef­fec­tively clear ev­ery­one.</p>
    <p>At the same time, the dorms need to have no in­fec­tions so work­ers do not get re­in­fected when they re­turn, he said.</p>
    <p>“So, I think it is im­por­tant for us to un­der­stand that ac­tu­ally it is a sys­tem­atic way and quite an ex­ten­sive process that we need to go through to en­sure that all 300,000 work­ers are cleared of this in­fec­tion and are able to re­turn to work,” said Mr Gan.</p>
