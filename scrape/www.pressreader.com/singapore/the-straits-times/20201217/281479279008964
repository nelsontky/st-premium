    <p>Won­der Woman (2017) star Gal Gadot thinks it is time to ban­ish the stereo­type that a woman can­not wear dif­fer­ent hats and be beau­ti­ful and ca­pa­ble at the same time.</p>
    <p>And not just a su­per­pow­ered woman ei­ther – al­though that is what the Is­raeli ac­tress is once again in the se­quel, Won­der Woman 1984, which opens in Sin­ga­pore today.</p>
    <p>Set in the 1980s at the height of the Cold War, it sees her char­ac­ter, Diana Prince, face off against two new vil­lains, played by Pe­dro Pas­cal (Game Of Thrones, 2014) and Kris­ten Wiig (Brides­maids, 2011). Gadot shot to in­ter­na­tional star­dom on the heels of the first film, which be­came the high­est­gross­ing su­per­hero ori­gin story of all time, earn­ing US$820 mil­lion (S$1.1 bil­lion) at the box of­fice and putting her on Time mag­a­zine’s list of the 100 most in­flu­en­tial peo­ple in the world in 2018.</p>
    <p>But the 35-year-old has am­bi­tions well be­yond the DC Comics fran­chise.</p>
    <p>One is to tell sto­ries about real-life hero­ines – women such as 1940s Hol­ly­wood star Hedy La­marr, who also in­vented the tech­nol­ogy that led to se­cure Wi-Fi and Blue­tooth, and whom the ac­tress will pro­duce and star in a tele­vi­sion se­ries about.</p>
    <p>Speak­ing to the press in Los An­ge­les, Gadot says “be­ing am­bi­tious” and pur­su­ing projects such as the lat­ter “makes me brave”.</p>
    <p>“Be­cause then I have this hunger to con­quer my wants and do things that many times feel like they are out of my com­fort zone.”</p>
    <p>In front of the cam­era, the for­mer model and Miss Is­rael win­ner – who has ap­peared in other DC Comics films as well as the Fast & Fu­ri­ous fran­chise (2001 to 2019) – was never in any doubt about the roles she wanted to play.</p>
    <p>“Even when I first came to Hol­ly­wood, and you do those gen­eral meet­ings where ev­ery­one asks you what’s your dream role, I al­ways said I just wanted to por­tray an in­de­pen­dent, strong, real woman be­cause I felt like there wasn’t enough of that out there.</p>
    <p>“And I think for ev­ery woman in the world, that is in our DNA – to ac­knowl­edge who we are and to know how the world should be,” adds the star, who is mar­ried to Is­raeli real-es­tate de­vel­oper Yaron Varsano, 45. The cou­ple have two daugh­ters aged three and nine.</p>
    <p>She has no time for the at­ti­tude that a woman who is at­trac­tive can­not also be in­tel­li­gent and ca­pa­ble, and this is why she pushed to make the se­ries about La­marr, which will air on Ap­ple TV+ at a yet-to-be-an­nounced date.</p>
    <p>Gadot ac­knowl­edges it has be­come some­what trendy for Alist ac­tresses to set up their own pro­duc­tion com­pa­nies. “But it came out of a need be­cause I want to tell sto­ries that are mean­ing­ful to me. So I’m happy for the trend.”</p>
    <p>La­marr’s story is also truly re­mark­able. Gadot says: “She was one of the big­gest stars in Hol­ly­wood and she was a bombshell... They named grenades in World War II af­ter her.</p>
    <p>“But Hedy was also very bright. She in­vented the se­cret com­mu­ni­ca­tions sys­tem that went on to be­come the ba­sis of Wi-Fi and Blue­tooth. And she never got recog­ni­tion for it.”</p>
    <p>Gadot takes some com­fort in the fact that women’s place in so­ci­ety has im­proved since then.</p>
    <p>“We’re still in this trans­for­ma­tion, but I’m happy that we’re at a junc­tion I don’t think women have been at be­fore, where you can wear all dif­fer­ent hats and be all dif­fer­ent things and that’s okay.”</p>
    <p>In ad­di­tion to be­ing an ex­trav­a­ganza of 1980s nos­tal­gia, the new Won­der Woman movie is also about fe­male friend­ships – par­tic­u­larly the one be­tween Diana and ar­chae­ol­o­gist Bar­bara Ann Min­erva (Wiig).</p>
    <p>“When we find Diana, she’s very lonely. She has lost all her team mem­bers and she’s been around for decades by her­self do­ing the right thing.</p>
    <p>“Once she meets Bar­bara, she’s at­tracted to her as a friend – she’s funny, she’s smart, she’s all the things she can re­late to.”</p>
    <p>Dur­ing the eight-month shoot for the film, Gadot and Wiig hit it off and be­came fast friends.</p>
    <p>“We had a lot of fun shoot­ing this movie. There was never a dull mo­ment. We recorded our­selves and shot mu­sic videos on set (for fun). And she be­came one of my clos­est friends here, which I’m su­per grate­ful for,” says Gadot.</p>
    <p>Wiig, 47, says: “It was an in­stant friend­ship-slash-love af­fair.”</p>
    <p>And the comedic ac­tress re­veals one thing about Gadot her fans may not know.</p>
    <p>“She’s so funny. She has an amaz­ing sense of hu­mour,” says Wiig. “She can do voices and she’s so silly.</p>
    <p>“Our sense of hu­mour just com­pletely melded to­gether and that’s rare. We love each other.”</p>
