    <p>The Rental Re­lief Frame­work tar­gets land­lords without recog­nis­ing that there are small land­lords who suf­fer more than the ten­ants they are re­quired to sup­port (Small land­lords will be put in un­favourable po­si­tion by Re-Align Frame­work, Nov 18).</p>
    <p>My wife and I op­er­ate a meet­ings, in­cen­tives, con­fer­ences and ex­hi­bi­tions (Mice) busi­ness and we in­vested in a small of­fice space – which is now fully paid for – about 15 years ago for our own use.</p>
    <p>As we are now in our 60s and near­ing re­tire­ment, we de­cided a cou­ple of years ago to work from home and rent out the unit for some re­tire­ment in­come.</p>
    <p>With the on­set of the pan­demic, all our in­ter­na­tional events have been can­celled, and on top of hav­ing zero in­come from the Mice busi­ness, we are sad­dled with hefty can­cel­la­tion penal­ties.</p>
    <p>Un­der such cir­cum­stances, does the Gov­ern­ment se­ri­ously ex­pect us to sup­port our small and medium-sized en­ter­prise ten­ant, which suf­fered much less than us?</p>
    <p>The Rental Re­lief Frame­work sug­gests that there are other schemes we can turn to for as­sis­tance, but these are de­ferred pay­ment schemes that we do not need. Fur­ther­more, it makes no sense to ask us to pro­vide sup­port un­der the rental re­lief scheme and then seek help from an­other scheme.</p>
    <p>An asses­sor ap­pointed by the au­thor­i­ties de­ter­mined that our ten­ant qual­i­fied for the Ad­di­tional Rental Re­lief, and that we, the land­lord, did not sat­isfy the cri­te­ria for a re­duc­tion of that re­lief as our of­fice space is reg­is­tered un­der our pri­vate lim­ited com­pany, which is nei­ther an in­di­vid­ual nor a sole pro­pri­etor.</p>
    <p>How is a pri­vate lim­ited com­pany owned by two in­di­vid­u­als who are near re­tire­ment age, and in one of the in­dus­tries hard­est hit by Covid-19 travel re­stric­tions, deemed un­de­serv­ing of re­lief com­pared with an in­di­vid­ual or sole pro­pri­etor land­lord? We were not able to ask that question as the asses­sor’s de­ter­mi­na­tion is bind­ing.</p>
    <p>There are no other forms of sup­port other than the ones nar­rowly stip­u­lated in the frame­work.</p>
    <p>The as­sess­ment process leaves much to be de­sired.</p>
