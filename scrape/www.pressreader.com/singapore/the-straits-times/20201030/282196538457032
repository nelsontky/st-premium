    <p>As I read yet an­other re­port on how well 15-year-old Sin­ga­porean stu­dents have done in the in­ter­na­tional Pisa (Pro­gramme for In­ter­na­tional Stu­dent Assess­ment) tests (Pisa study: S’pore stu­dents top in in­ter­cul­tural and global is­sues, Oct 23), I won­der why there is such a dis­con­nect be­tween school per­for­mance in­di­ca­tors and the ob­sta­cles faced by older Sin­ga­pore­ans in se­cur­ing jobs, es­pe­cially when in com­pe­ti­tion with for­eign work­ers.</p>
    <p>It is dif­fi­cult to ar­gue an as­so­ci­a­tion be­tween cur­rent re­sults for 15-year-olds with the em­ploy­ment po­ten­tial of Sin­ga­pore­ans al­ready in their 50s, 40s or per­haps even 30s.</p>
    <p>Still, it is worth­while look­ing at this to en­sure that the same fate does not be­fall the cur­rent batch of teenage Sin­ga­pore­ans 25 years down the road.</p>
    <p>As ar­ti­fi­cial in­tel­li­gence and ro­bot­ics make “jobs/ca­reers for life” ob­so­lete, as new types of jobs are cre­ated and as we live longer, we need to an­tic­i­pate not just life­long but “lifewide” learn­ing, and ditch the con­cept of re­tir­ing in the job we first trained for at school.</p>
    <p>The sooner we ac­knowl­edge this and mod­ify our ed­u­ca­tional cur­ricu­lum to this end, the bet­ter our 15-year-olds can be pre­pared for an un­cer­tain fu­ture, what­ever their cur­rent Pisa scores.</p>
    <p>Cram­ming knowl­edge into young heads will not pre­pare them for their fu­ture, as knowl­edge be­comes out­moded very quickly.</p>
    <p>We need to teach crit­i­cal think­ing skills so that work­ers know how to learn, when it is time to un­learn and what knowl­edge it is they must re­learn.</p>
    <p>Crit­i­cal think­ing skills – in­volv­ing the abil­ity to an­a­lyse/syn­the­sise, eval­u­ate and cre­ate – keep us cu­ri­ous, and will there­fore help us to learn out­side the tra­di­tional dis­ci­plinary “si­los” to en­gage in lifewide learn­ing. Only then can Sin­ga­pore­ans be flex­i­ble and pre­pared for their next mean­ing­ful ca­reer, what­ever their age.</p>
    <p>As ar­ti­fi­cial in­tel­li­gence and ro­bot­ics make “jobs/ca­reers for life” ob­so­lete, as new types of jobs are cre­ated and as we live longer, we need to an­tic­i­pate not just life­long but “lifewide” learn­ing, and ditch the con­cept of re­tir­ing in the job we first trained in at school.</p>
