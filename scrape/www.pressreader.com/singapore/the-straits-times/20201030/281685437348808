    <p>2020</p>
    <p>• Oct 29: A man bursts into a church in the south­ern city of Nice, killing three peo­ple and in­jur­ing sev­eral oth­ers be­fore be­ing shot and ar­rested by po­lice. The same day, po­lice shoot and kill a man in Mont­favet, near the city of Avi­gnon in south­ern France, af­ter he had ear­lier threat­ened passers-by with a hand­gun.</p>
    <p>• Oct 16: A teacher is de­cap­i­tated near a school on the out­skirts of Paris. The as­sailant is shot dead by po­lice. Pros­e­cu­tors say they are treat­ing the in­ci­dent as “a mur­der linked to a ter­ror­ist or­gan­i­sa­tion”. Po­lice say the vic­tim had re­cently shown car­i­ca­tures of Prophet Muham­mad in class.</p>
    <p>• Sept 25: A man armed with a knife se­ri­ously wounds two peo­ple in a sus­pected ter­ror at­tack out­side the for­mer of­fices of French satir­i­cal weekly Char­lie Hebdo in Paris, three weeks into the trial of men ac­cused of be­ing ac­com­plices in the 2015 mas­sacre of the news­pa­per’s staff.</p>
    <p>• April 4: In the south-eastern river­side town of Ro­mans-sur-Isere, a 33-year-old Su­danese refugee goes on a stab­bing spree in broad day­light, killing two peo­ple. Af­ter the ram­page, the as­sailant is ar­rested with­out a fight and pros­e­cu­tors launch an in­ves­ti­ga­tion into “mur­der linked to a ter­ror­ist en­ter­prise” and “as­so­ci­a­tion with ter­ror­ist wrong­do­ers”.</p>
    <p>• Jan 4: A knife-wield­ing man runs amok in a park south of Paris, killing a man walk­ing with his wife and wound­ing two other peo­ple be­fore be­ing shot dead by po­lice. Anti-ter­ror in­ves­ti­ga­tors take over the in­ves­ti­ga­tion fol­low­ing ev­i­dence that 22-year-old Nathan C. had re­cently con­verted to Is­lam.</p>
    <p>2019 Oct 3:</p>
    <p>• Mick­ael Har­pon, a 45-year-old com­puter ex­pert in the Paris po­lice in­tel­li­gence-gath­er­ing depart­ment, uses a kitchen knife and an oys­ter shucker to kill four col­leagues. His 30-minute ram­page ends when an of­fi­cer shoots him dead. It emerges that Har­pon had con­verted to Is­lam about 10 years ago and had con­nec­tions in the ul­tra-con­ser­va­tive Salafist move­ment.</p>
    <p>2018</p>
    <p>May 12:</p>
    <p>• Khamzat Az­i­mov, 20, a nat­u­ralised French­man of Chechen ori­gin, stabs to death a 29-year-old man in Paris’ busy Opera dis­trict be­fore be­ing shot dead by po­lice. The Is­lamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS) ter­ror group claims re­spon­si­bil­ity.</p>
    <p>2017</p>
    <p>• Oct 1: A 29-year-old Tu­nisian kills two young women with a knife at the main train sta­tion in the south­ern city of Mar­seille. He is shot dead by sol­diers, and ISIS claims re­spon­si­bil­ity for his at­tack.</p>
