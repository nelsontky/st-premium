    <p>The ap­proval by the Euro­pean Union of a €750 bil­lion (S$1.2 tril­lion) re­cov­ery plan, de­signed to help mem­ber states in over­com­ing the eco­nomic im­pact of the coro­n­avirus pan­demic, is hailed as a his­toric step.</p>
    <p>For the first time, the EU will col­lec­tively bor­row part of this cash and al­lo­cate it to its need­ier mem­bers, of­ten in the form of grants rather than loans.</p>
    <p>But the re­joic­ing in­side the EU at this mea­sure is likely to be short.</p>
    <p>For di­vi­sions are emerg­ing over the po­lit­i­cal con­di­tions which the Euro­pean Com­mis­sion (EC) – the EU’s ex­ec­u­tive body – may im­pose in re­turn for cash dis­burse­ments.</p>
    <p>Mr Cle­ment Beaune, France’s newly ap­pointed min­is­ter for Euro­pean af­fairs, has warned that EU gov­ern­ments that un­der­mine fun­da­men­tal rights, such as equal­ity and me­dia free­dom, should face fi­nan­cial sanc­tions.</p>
    <p>Nor was Mr Beaune coy about which coun­tries France would wish to see tar­geted: Poland and Hun­gary, two na­tions ruled by right-wing gov­ern­ments. “We can’t tell French, Pol­ish, Hun­gar­ian or other Euro­pean cit­i­zens that we should have fi­nan­cial sol­i­dar­ity in Europe, yet not care how the ba­sic rules of democ­racy, free me­dia and equal rights are re­spected,” he told the me­dia.</p>
    <p>France, he ex­plained, will push for a “ro­bust” mech­a­nism that will make ac­cess to EU re­cov­ery aid con­di­tional on the re­spect for “fun­da­men­tal val­ues”.</p>
    <p>Frus­tra­tion within the EU over Poland and Hun­gary is not new; the two former com­mu­nist coun­tries, which joined the union in 2004, have of­ten been at odds with other mem­ber states.</p>
    <p>Dis­putes ex­ist over all as­pects of the re­la­tion­ship, from the way Europe should be gov­erned, to ques­tions such as the place of reli­gion in so­ci­ety, and to equal rights for gay cou­ples, mat­ters over which the more con­ser­va­tive</p>
    <p>Pol­ish and Hun­gar­ian na­tions tend to take a dif­fer­ent view from elec­torates in the western part of the con­ti­nent.</p>
    <p>Ten­sions were ag­gra­vated over the past few years by more fun­da­men­tal dif­fer­ences in at­ti­tudes to im­mi­gra­tion, with Hun­gary in par­tic­u­lar in­sist­ing not only that its bor­ders should re­main closed to mi­grants, but that it would also not shoul­der the bur­den of the rest of Europe in help­ing with asy­lum-seek­ers al­ready ad­mit­ted to the con­ti­nent.</p>
    <p>Fur­ther­more, the de­ci­sion of politi­cians in Poland to cam­paign in their coun­try’s re­cent pres­i­den­tial elec­tions on an anti-gay plat­form in­fu­ri­ated gov­ern­ments and hu­man rights NGOs through­out Europe.</p>
    <p>Hun­gary and Poland’s loy­al­ties to the EU are not in doubt; opin­ion polls re­peat­edly show that vast ma­jori­ties in both na­tions con­tinue to sup­port EU mem­ber­ship.</p>
    <p>Still, France has led the ar­gu­ment in Europe that the two coun­tries can­not ex­pect to rely on EU sol­i­dar­ity when it suits them – such as when they need ac­cess to Euro­pean re­cov­ery funds – but de­cline to ap­ply EU obli­ga­tions, which in­clude equal rights for all peo­ple, re­gard­less of sex­ual ori­en­ta­tion, and sup­port for multi-eth­nic so­ci­eties.</p>
    <p>As a re­sult, the need for po­lit­i­cal con­di­tion­al­ity was very much part of the heated de­bate which ac­com­pa­nied the re­cent adoption of the EU’s re­cov­ery fund.</p>
    <p>At the end of these ne­go­ti­a­tions, Pol­ish Prime Min­is­ter Ma­teusz Mo­raw­iecki and Hun­gar­ian Prime Min­is­ter Vik­tor Or­ban raced to de­clare in a joint press con­fer­ence that they had suc­cess­fully warded off ef­forts to cut off dis­burse­ments to gov­ern­ments that have been found to vi­o­late the rule of law.</p>
    <p>But that was only par­tially cor­rect, for the fi­nal de­ci­sion signed by the 27 EU lead­ers did con­tain clear lan­guage ty­ing the dis­tri­bu­tion of EU re­sources to com­pli­ance with the rule of law, although what that means in prac­tice was left to the EC to de­fine.</p>
    <p>By speak­ing up now, France is try­ing to in­flu­ence the com­mis­sion’s fu­ture ac­tions.</p>
    <p>How­ever, it is an ex­er­cise fraught with dan­gers for Europe.</p>
    <p>Im­pos­ing po­lit­i­cal con­di­tions on mem­ber states could shat­ter Euro­pean sol­i­dar­ity – pre­cisely what the re­cov­ery fund is sup­posed to cement.</p>
    <p>And it could also prove tricky to ap­ply. Both Hun­gary and Poland ar­gue that, un­der EU treaties, de­ci­sions to pun­ish mem­ber states can be adopted only by una­nim­ity, which means that such mea­sures are valid only if a mem­ber state agrees to be pun­ished by vot­ing for such con­di­tion­al­ity.</p>
    <p>They also ar­gue that they are be­ing vic­timised not for vi­o­lat­ing EU laws or stan­dards, but for dar­ing to chal­lenge what are ef­fec­tively Western Euro­pean life­style mores or so­cial choices.</p>
    <p>Be that as it may, the pres­sure on the EC to dis­ci­pline Poland and Hun­gary is only likely to in­crease.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing the re­cent Pol­ish pres­i­den­tial elec­toral cam­paign, sev­eral of the coun­try’s cities con­trolled by right-wing may­ors de­clared them­selves as “les­bian, gay, bi­sex­ual and trans­gen­der-free zones”. These cities have now dis­cov­ered that their ap­pli­ca­tions for EU fund­ing have been re­jected.</p>
    <p>It is but the first shot in what prom­ises to be a long Euro­pean cul­ture war.</p>
