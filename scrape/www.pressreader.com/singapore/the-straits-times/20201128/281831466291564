    <p>Seven-year-old Damian Mikail Mohd Khairul An­war some­times thinks out loud in Man­darin, mak­ing his mum chuckle.</p>
    <p>The boy, who is be­ing raised in a con­ser­va­tive Malay fam­ily, at­tends a Chi­nese ver­nac­u­lar school in Subang Jaya, in Se­lan­gor, where all of the sub­jects are taught in Man­darin, ex­cept for Ba­hasa Me­layu, English and Is­lamic stud­ies.</p>
    <p>Ver­nac­u­lar schools, which use Chi­nese or Tamil as the medium of in­struc­tion, are also funded by the gov­ern­ment.</p>
    <p>“I want my son to be ac­cept­ing of oth­ers – what bet­ter way than to let him go to a Chi­nese school and learn Man­darin. This is also to pre­pare him for his fu­ture, see­ing how China is the big­gest eco­nomic player,” Madam As­mah Rus­man told The Straits Times.</p>
    <p>“I know we can send him to a tu­ition cen­tre or en­rol him in a course, but he won’t be able to master it (Man­darin) i n terms of speech, read­ing and writ­ing. If he en­ters a Chi­nese school, he will be us­ing the lan­guage in his ev­ery­day life and he would be able to broaden his mind,” she added.</p>
    <p>Damian is part of a grow­ing num­ber of Malay stu­dents in Malaysia who are at­tend­ing Chi­nese ver­nac­u­lar schools.</p>
    <p>Ed­u­ca­tion Min­is­ter Mohd Radzi Md Jidin told Par­lia­ment on Nov 11 that more non-Chi­nese stu­dents are en­rolling in Chi­nese ver­nac­u­lar schools. Malays make up 15.33 per cent of the num­ber in 2020, up from the 9.15 per cent in 2010.</p>
    <p>Na­tional Union of the Teach­ing Pro­fes­sion (NUTP) sec­re­tary-gen­eral Harry Tan be­lieves in­ter­ra­cial mar­riages have been partly re­spon­si­ble for more Malay stu­dents in Chi­nese schools.</p>
    <p>“It could also be that the par­ents see that there is a prospect in learn­ing an ex­tra lan­guage. With China be­ing the new eco­nomic gi­ant, they feel that job prospects can be bet­ter. In ad­di­tion, many par­ents view the strength in the ver­nac­u­lar schools is in math­e­mat­ics,” he told The Straits Times.</p>
    <p>Par­ent Ac­tion Group for Ed­u­ca­tion pres­i­dent Noor Az­imah Ab­dul Rahim said the fail­ure to ful­fil the de­mand for Man­darin teach­ers at na­tional Malay-medium schools could have also led to the trend.</p>
    <p>For­mer deputy ed­u­ca­tion min­is­ter Teoh Nie Ching said the lack of Man­darin classes in Malaymediu­m na­tional schools was due to the high cost of train­ing teach­ers who now have to be trained first at Bei­jing For­eign Stud­ies Univer­sity for five years with the gov­ern­ment foot­ing the cost of their tu­ition and liv­ing ex­penses there.</p>
    <p>“This is very costly,” she said, adding that it was pos­si­ble to train them to teach the sub­ject as a sec­ond lan­guage lo­cally. The sub­ject of ver­nac­u­lar schools has al­ways been a hot but­ton is­sue in Malaysia, with many politi­cians and non-govern­men­tal or­gan­i­sa­tions us­ing them as a po­lit­i­cal tool.</p>
    <p>There have been re­peated calls for them to be abol­ished. Over the years, sev­eral law­suits have also been filed by Malay NGOs, seek­ing to de­clare the ex­is­tence of such schools as un­con­sti­tu­tional.</p>
    <p>But Madam Rashitha A. Hamid, an­other par­ent who has en­rolled her nine-year-old daugh­ter in a Chi­nese ver­nac­u­lar school, said there was no rea­son for such schools to be closed be­cause at the end of the day the only dif­fer­ence was the medium of in­struc­tion.</p>
    <p>“We still learn English and Ba­hasa Me­layu in ver­nac­u­lar schools. Per­haps some Malay ex­trem­ists feel in­se­cure. When you talk about to­geth­er­ness, it lies within us. There’s no guar­an­tee that Malaymediu­m na­tional schools re­ally pro­mote unity. I’m speak­ing from my per­sonal ex­pe­ri­ence,” she said.</p>
