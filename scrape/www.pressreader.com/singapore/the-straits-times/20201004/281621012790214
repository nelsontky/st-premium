    <p>WASH­ING­TON • United States Pres­i­dent Donald Trump’s an­nounce­ment on Fri­day that he had tested pos­i­tive for Covid-19 set off a wave of tweets and Face­book posts with a com­mon re­frain, es­pe­cially from the left: Why should we be­lieve him?</p>
    <p>Overnight, hun­dreds of tweets were posted cast­ing doubt, with­out ev­i­dence, on Mr Trump’s in­fec­tion, which has been con­firmed by his doc­tor.</p>
    <p>The tweets peaked at five per minute on Fri­day morn­ing, ac­cord­ing to so­cial me­dia mon­i­tor­ing ser­vice Datam­inr. The doubters in­cluded The New Yorker staff writer Je­lani Cobb and Time ed­i­tor-at­large Anand Girid­haradas.</p>
    <p>Some sug­gested the an­nounce­ment could be an ex­cuse to de­lay the elec­tion and can­cel fu­ture pres­i­den­tial de­bates. Some doubters said they could not be­lieve Mr Trump, given how much false and mis­lead­ing in­for­ma­tion he has spread about the virus in the past.</p>
    <p>Re­searchers at Cor­nell Univer­sity pub­lished a study last week show­ing that Mr Trump was the sin­gle largest driver of false and mis­lead­ing in­for­ma­tion about the coro­n­avirus. Men­tions by him made up nearly 38 per cent of the over­all “mis­in­for­ma­tion con­ver­sa­tion”.</p>
    <p>“We’re in an en­vi­ron­ment where con­spir­a­cies are thriv­ing, in part be­cause the Pres­i­dent en­cour­ages them,” said Ms Melissa Ryan, chief ex­ec­u­tive of Card Strate­gies, a con­sult­ing firm that re­searches dis­in­for­ma­tion. The sit­u­a­tion has cre­ated “the per­fect storm for peo­ple to as­sume that the White House isn’t be­ing truth­ful”, she added.</p>
    <p>Many de­niers also latched on to a Sept 18 tweet that had orig­i­nally been shared in con­spir­acy cir­cles but was re­shared widely after the an­nounce­ment.</p>
    <p>“Trump’s Oc­to­ber sur­prise will be the an­nounce­ment of ‘his in­fec­tion’. Fake, but quite dra­matic,” read the post, which col­lected 15,000 in­ter­ac­tions across Face­book and Twit­ter.</p>
    <p>Some saw re­ac­tions to the an­nounce­ment as a re­flec­tion of the sheer mag­ni­tude of mis­in­for­ma­tion that has em­anated from Mr Trump.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, Twit­ter warned that it would delete tweets root­ing for Mr Trump’s death from Covid-19.</p>
    <p>“Tweets that wish or hope for death, se­ri­ous bod­ily harm or fa­tal dis­ease against any­one are not al­lowed and will need to be re­moved,” Twit­ter said, though it added that this did not mean that of­fend­ing users would be sus­pended from the site.</p>
