    <p>From De­cem­ber, busi­nesses that em­ploy rid­ers who use ac­tive mo­bil­ity de­vices on pub­lic paths must en­sure that they are cov­ered by third­party li­a­bil­ity in­sur­ance against in­jury and death dur­ing the course of their work.</p>
    <p>Ac­tive mo­bil­ity de­vices re­fer to bi­cy­cles, per­sonal mo­bil­ity de­vices, power-as­sisted bi­cy­cles, mo­torised wheel­chairs and mo­bil­ity scoot­ers.</p>
    <p>The rule also ap­plies to li­censed de­vice-shar­ing op­er­a­tors pro­vid­ing mo­torised de­vices for hire, the Land Trans­port Author­ity (LTA) said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>“They need to en­sure that their rid­ers, em­ploy­ees and out­work­ers who use such de­vices are ad­e­quately cov­ered by third-party li­a­bil­ity in­sur­ance against in­jury and death dur­ing the course of work, un­der an ap­proved pol­icy,” it said in an in­dus­try cir­cu­lar.</p>
    <p>The rid­ers must be in­sured for a sum of at least $200,000 per claim and an ex­cess amount that does not ex­ceed $500 per claim.</p>
    <p>The in­sur­ance schemes for elec­tric scooter and power-as­sisted bi­cy­cle rid­ers also can­not con­tain ex­clu­sions pre­vent­ing them from car­ry­ing loads or us­ing a de­vice not reg­is­tered in their name, said LTA.</p>
    <p>An em­ployer who fails to abide by the re­quire­ments can be fined not more than $10,000 or jailed for up to 12 months, or both.</p>
    <p>Where the of­fender is not an in­di­vid­ual, the penalty will be a fine not ex­ceed­ing $20,000.</p>
    <p>These changes were an­nounced in Fe­bru­ary as part of amend­ments to the Ac­tive Mo­bil­ity Act in or­der to pro­vide vic­tims in any ac­ci­dent greater re­course to com­pen­sa­tion.</p>
    <p>The re­vised laws are also meant to give em­ploy­ers of such rid­ers greater re­spon­si­bil­ity to­wards their work­ers and mem­bers of the pub­lic.</p>
    <p>In a Face­book post yes­ter­day, Senior Par­lia­men­tary Sec­re­tary for Trans­port Baey Yam Keng said that both the LTA and the Ac­tive Mo­bil­ity Ad­vi­sory Panel have been en­gag­ing the in­sur­ance in­dus­try to work out suit­able cov­er­age for ac­ci­dent vic­tims and rid­ers if an in­ci­dent oc­curs.</p>
    <p>“It is im­por­tant for business op­er­a­tors who work with in­di­vid­u­als who ride ac­tive mo­bil­ity de­vices on pub­lic paths as part of their jobs to en­sure that their work­ers are cov­ered by third-party li­a­bil­ity in­sur­ance. This will be im­ple­mented from Dec 1,” he said.</p>
    <p>A spokesman for De­liv­eroo told The Straits Times that it has been work­ing closely with its in­sur­ance provider and LTA to make sure its rid­ers are cov­ered ad­e­quately.</p>
    <p>Food­panda Sin­ga­pore’s head of lo­gis­tics Lim Zheng Gang also said that the in­sur­ance plans the com­pany has in place to cover its rid­ers com­ply with LTA’s re­quire­ments.</p>
    <p>The food de­liv­ery com­pany started pro­vid­ing third-party li­a­bil­ity in­sur­ance for ac­tive mo­bil­ity rid­ers in Septem­ber last year, and the lat­est re­newal for this was last month.</p>
