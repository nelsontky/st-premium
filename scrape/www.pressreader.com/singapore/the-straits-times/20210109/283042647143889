    <p>The Mercedes-Benz E-class, a lux­ury stal­wart which has been in pro­duc­tion since 1953, has fi­nally joined the 21st cen­tury.</p>
    <p>The fifth-gen­er­a­tion facelift is so full of new­fan­gled gad­gets, it could even qual­ify as a new model.</p>
    <p>The first things you no­tice as you step in­side are its new steer­ing wheel – a bit retro in de­sign but em­bed­ded with plenty of new tech – and two high-res­o­lu­tion 12.3-inch dis­plays made to look like one panoramic screen.</p>
    <p>Al­though an evo­lu­tion of the pref­acelift’s cock­pit, it still looks re­fresh­ingly dif­fer­ent.</p>
    <p>The steer­ing wheel has sen­sors which know when your hands are not on the wheel. Mini touch­pads on the sides al­low ac­cess to the in­fo­tain­ment sys­tem via thumb strokes – clever but also prone to ac­ci­den­tal switch­ing of chan­nels.</p>
    <p>The car’s adap­tive cruise con­trol is now linked to live traf­fic in­for­ma­tion (if avail­able) and its ac­tive steer­ing as­sist will keep the car in lane as it fol­lows the ve­hi­cle in front (even round a corner).</p>
    <p>Un­der cer­tain con­di­tions, the car can coast with en­gine off. When this hap­pens, all its func­tions are kept alive by the car’s 12-volt bat­tery (un­like mild hy­brids, there is no ad­di­tional bat­tery for this).</p>
    <p>Its au­to­matic park­ing sys­tem is now able to slot the car into ver­ti­cal or par­al­lel spa­ces with zero in­ter­ven­tion from the driver. An in­dus­try-first, it even changes gears and mod­u­lates the brakes.</p>
    <p>If you wish to park man­u­ally, the car’s 360-de­gree cam­era is crisp even in low light. A vir­tual perime­ter around the car bends and changes colour as you near an ob­ject. Aug­mented by beep­ers, it is fool­proof.</p>
    <p>The facelift has an En­er­giz­ing pack­age, which adjusts the seats minutely af­ter long dis­tances to re­lieve fa­tigue. This sys­tem can be paired with a Garmin watch which mon­i­tors your per­sonal val­ues such as stress level or sleep qual­ity, and adjusts the cli­mate con­trol, am­bi­ent light­ing and even mu­sic to keep you alert. This, too, is a first.</p>
    <p>An­other first is the au­to­matic seat ad­just­ment. Just key in your height and the seat and steer­ing will be moved to op­ti­mal po­si­tions. Alas, I find my rec­om­mended po­si­tions to be too near the wheel.</p>
    <p>As for aes­thet­ics, small tweaks add up to re­tain the E-class’ stand­ing among its peers. Its LED head­lamps are sleeker, its grille (which varies in de­sign ac­cord­ing to model vari­ant) more dra­matic, its tail-lights com­pletely re­vamped. And you see more chrome.</p>
    <p>In­side, a hood shield­ing the dig­i­tal screens from glare is now more pro­nounced (sim­i­larly, a crease in the front bumper assem­bly forms a mini hood above the head­lamps).</p>
    <p>The level of trim, fit and fin­ish are still be­fit­ting a pre­mium car.</p>
    <p>En­dowed with more power and torque, the E200 now clocks a 7.4-sec­ond cen­tury sprint (from 7.7 sec­onds). The test-car av­er­aged 9 litres/100km, which is rather im­pres­sive for such a big sa­loon and which is not far from Merc’s de­clared 7.9 litres/100km.</p>
    <p>What would have made the E200 even more out­stand­ing is more com­fort and re­fine­ment.</p>
    <p>Al­though the car still rides and han­dles rea­son­ably well and its gear­box is smoother now, the en­gine sounds a lit­tle like a diesel.</p>
    <p>The stop-start sys­tem kicks in with a jud­der and the air-con­di­tioner has to be set at 20 deg C be­fore it is cool enough. And for the car’s size, the sec­ond row is best only for two.</p>
    <p>But with all its new gad­gets, you might be too dis­tracted to no­tice these short­com­ings.</p>
