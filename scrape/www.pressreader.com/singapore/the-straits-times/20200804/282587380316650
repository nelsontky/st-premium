    <p>On a Novem­ber night five years ago, Sin­ga­porean poet Theophilus Kwek was walk­ing back to his room in Ox­ford Univer­sity when a car drove up. Some youths leaned out of the car win­dow and struck him in the face with a metal rod, break­ing his glasses.</p>
    <p>“As they drove past, they yelled some­thing which I couldn’t quite make out at the time,” re­calls Kwek, now 26.</p>
    <p>“As with many of th­ese in­ci­dents that hap­pen al­most rou­tinely in cities like Ox­ford or Lon­don, I still don’t know if this was an act of racist ag­gres­sion or not.”</p>
    <p>Kwek did not suf­fer last­ing in­jury from the in­ci­dent, but it un­set­tled him in a deep-seated way. In his poem Oc­cur­rence, he tries to de­scribe hurt as “some­thing that is not a mere oc­cur­rence, but in the land­scape of Eng­land it­self”.</p>
    <p>Oc­cur­rence is one of the po­ems in Kwek’s fourth and lat­est col­lec­tion, Mov­ing House.</p>
    <p>It is brought out by Car­canet Press in the United King­dom, which has pub­lished po­ets such as Pulitzer Prize-win­ner John Ash­bery and Ea­van Boland, as well as Sin­ga­porean poet Koh Jee Leong’s col­lec­tion Steep Tea in 2015.</p>
    <p>Many of the po­ems in Mov­ing House re­flect on mi­gra­tion and travel, from the tribu­la­tions of mi­grant work­ers in Sin­ga­pore to Kwek’s own ex­pe­ri­ences in Eng­land as a mi­grant – al­beit a priv­i­leged one – from a for­mer Bri­tish colony.</p>
    <p>The book is ded­i­cated to “those who build our houses and those who be­lieve in keep­ing them open”.</p>
    <p>“Ev­ery­body ex­pe­ri­ences mov­ing house at least once,” says Kwek. “But peo­ple ex­pe­ri­ence mov­ing for all sorts of dif­fer­ent rea­sons. Some are com­pelled to move by cir­cum­stances be­yond their con­trol. Some, who have much more priv­i­leged po­si­tions, choose to move.</p>
    <p>“But what all peo­ple who move have in com­mon would be some sense of the dis­lo­ca­tion that move­ment brings, of los­ing one so­cial world and tran­si­tion­ing into an­other. I was think­ing about how those of us who move carry our houses with us and what those houses look like, in terms of our sto­ries, our ex­pe­ri­ences and the com­mu­ni­ties that we join.”</p>
    <p>By the age of 24, Kwek had al­ready been short­listed twice for the Sin­ga­pore Lit­er­a­ture Prize, in 2014 and 2018 for his col­lec­tions Cir­cle Line and Giv­ing Ground re­spec­tively.</p>
    <p>Kwek, whose par­ents are doc­tors, works in the health­care sec­tor. He has a mas­ter’s de­gree in Refugee and Forced Mi­gra­tion Stud­ies from Ox­ford, and vol­un­teers with mi­grant worker ad­vo­cacy groups in his free time.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing the Covid-19 cir­cuit breaker, he helped de­liver sup­plies to mi­grant work­ers un­able to leave their dor­mi­to­ries and is part of the group Wel­come In My Back­yard, which aims to make work­ers feel wel­come in hous­ing es­tates.</p>
    <p>Many of his po­ems are based on cases in the news. This stems from a writ­ing rit­ual he had in the UK, in which he would go on Thurs­day morn­ings to the same cafe, sit in the same spot and not al­low him­self to leave un­til he had writ­ten a poem.</p>
    <p>Of­ten, he would pro­cras­ti­nate while scrolling through the news, which is how he wound up writ­ing po­ems such as Dead Man’s Sav­ings Won’t Go To Wife, about a 2016 case in which a judge ruled that a for­eign wife did not truly love her Sin­ga­porean hus­band and thus should not get his Cen­tral Prov­i­dent Fund (CPF) money af­ter his death.</p>
    <p>“(Modernist poet) Ezra Pound said lit­er­a­ture is news that stays news,” he says. “In­stead of a jour­nal­is­tic hot take that ages with the next news cy­cle, po­ets can ex­trap­o­late from the present mo­ment some­thing that is univer­sal and last­ing. Each suc­cess­ful poem lifts us out of the mo­ment and helps us to ac­cess the re­flec­tive fu­ture.”</p>
    <p>The most re­cent poem in his col­lec­tion is Lucky, ded­i­cated to Ms Ar­lyn Nu­cos and Ms Abi­gail Leste, the Filipino do­mes­tic work­ers who were killed i n an ac­ci­dent last De­cem­ber when a car hit them and four oth­ers on the pave­ment out­side Lucky Plaza.</p>
    <p>“The av­er­age Sin­ga­porean reader would have looked at this in­ci­dent and seen a stroke of bad luck,” says Kwek.</p>
    <p>“But it’s no ac­ci­dent that mi­grants in Sin­ga­pore are at greater risk of such traf­fic ac­ci­dents. There’s no pub­lic space for them, hence they’re on the side­walk. So many of th­ese things are baked into the sys­tem.”</p>
    <p>While Covid-19 has prompted a groundswel­l of xeno­pho­bic sen­ti­ment, he is heart­ened by the com­mu­nity ini­tia­tives that have sprung up to sup­port mi­grant work­ers.</p>
    <p>“Go­ing for­ward with a greater aware­ness, a greater sense of fel­low feel­ing dur­ing this time and gen­er­a­tional change, I think Sin­ga­pore­ans might be a lit­tle bit more open.”</p>
