    <p>LON­DON • Amid a sput­ter­ing vac­cine roll-out and fears of a new and po­ten­tially more trans­mis­si­ble vari­ant of the coro­n­avirus, Bri­tain has qui­etly up­dated its vac­ci­na­tion play­book to al­low for a mix-and-match vac­cine reg­i­men.</p>
    <p>If a se­cond dose of the vac­cine a pa­tient orig­i­nally re­ceived is not avail­able, or if the man­u­fac­turer of the pa­tient’s first shot is not known, another vac­cine may be sub­sti­tuted, health of­fi­cials said.</p>
    <p>The new guid­ance con­tra­dicts guide­lines in the United States, where the Cen­tres for Dis­ease Con­trol and Pre­ven­tion has noted that the au­tho­rised Covid-19 vac­cines “are not in­ter­change­able”, and that “the safety and ef­fi­cacy of a mixed-prod­uct se­ries have not been eval­u­ated. Both doses of the se­ries should be com­pleted with the same prod­uct”.</p>
    <p>Some sci­en­tists say Bri­tain is gam­bling with its new guid­ance. “There are no data on this idea what­so­ever,” said Dr John Moore, a vac­cine ex­pert from Cor­nell Univer­sity.</p>
    <p>He said of­fi­cials in Bri­tain “seem to have aban­doned science com­pletely now and are just try­ing to guess their way out of a mess”.</p>
    <p>Dr Mary Ram­say, head of im­mu­ni­sa­tions at Public Health Eng­land, said mix­ing of Covid-19 vac­cines would hap­pen only on ex­tremely rare oc­ca­sions, and that the govern­ment was not rec­om­mend­ing the mix­ing of vac­cines, which re­quire at least two doses given sev­eral weeks apart.</p>
    <p>“Ev­ery ef­fort should be made to give them the same vac­cine, but where this is not pos­si­ble, it is bet­ter to give a se­cond dose of another vac­cine than not at all,” she said.</p>
    <p>The coro­n­avirus has killed more than 74,000 peo­ple in Bri­tain – the se­cond-high­est death toll in Europe, and health of­fi­cials are rac­ing to de­liver doses.</p>
    <p>To counter the rapid spread of a much more in­fec­tious vari­ant of the virus, Bri­tain re­ac­ti­vated emer­gency hos­pi­tals built at the start of the pan­demic and shut pri­mary schools in Lon­don on Fri­day. The coun­try has is­sued an emer­gency green light to two vac­cines, de­vel­oped by Pfizer and As­traZeneca.</p>
    <p>About two mil­lion doses of the As­traZeneca-Ox­ford vac­cine are set to be sup­plied to the United King­dom ev­ery week by the mid­dle of this month, The Times of Lon­don re­ported yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to Bri­tain’s new guid­ance, “ev­ery ef­fort should be made” to com­plete a dos­ing reg­i­men with the same shot first used. But when “the same vac­cine is not avail­able, or if the first prod­uct re­ceived is un­known, it is rea­son­able to of­fer one dose of the lo­cally avail­able prod­uct” the se­cond time around.</p>
    <p>“This op­tion is pre­ferred if the in­di­vid­ual is likely to be at im­me­di­ate high risk or is con­sid­ered un­likely to at­tend again,” the rec­om­men­da­tion said. Be­cause both vac­cines tar­get the spike pro­tein of the coro­n­avirus, “it is likely the se­cond dose will help to boost the re­sponse to the first dose.”</p>
    <p>Of­fi­cials at Public Health Eng­land drew at­ten­tion to the sim­i­lar­i­ties be­tween the Pfizer and As­traZeneca vac­cines, and said clin­i­cal tri­als test­ing mixed reg­i­mens were to start some time this year.</p>
    <p>Both vac­cines are in­tended to be doled out in reg­i­mens of two shots, de­liv­ered three or four weeks apart. But with­out ev­i­dence to back it, the hy­brid vac­ci­na­tion ap­proach will be a sci­en­tific gam­ble.</p>
    <p>They both in­tro­duce into the body a spike pro­tein that, while not in­fec­tious, can teach im­mune cells to recog­nise and fight off the ac­tual coro­n­avirus. But while Pfizer’s vac­cine re­lies on a mol­e­cule called mes­sen­ger RNA, or mRNA, pack­aged into greasy bub­bles, As­traZeneca’s shots are de­signed around a virus shell that de­liv­ers DNA, a cousin of mRNA.</p>
    <p>Bri­tain sparked con­tro­versy ear­lier last week by an­nounc­ing plans to de­lay giv­ing the vac­cine booster shot in an at­tempt to en­sure more peo­ple could be given the more limited pro­tec­tion con­ferred by a sin­gle dose.</p>
    <p>The top US in­fec­tious dis­eases ex­pert, Dr An­thony Fauci, said on Fri­day that he did not agree with the Bri­tish ap­proach of de­lay­ing the se­cond dose by up to 12 weeks.</p>

        <p data-role="text">Peo&#xAD;ple in the Welsh city of Cardiff last month wait&#xAD;ing to re&#xAD;ceive the Pfizer-BioNTech vac&#xAD;cine, which is one of two Covid-19 vac&#xAD;cines that Bri&#xAD;tain has given an emer&#xAD;gency green light to. With in&#xAD;fec&#xAD;tions surg&#xAD;ing in the coun&#xAD;try again, Bri&#xAD;tish health of&#xAD;fi&#xAD;cials are caught in a deadly race with the coro&#xAD;n&#xAD;avirus and are strug&#xAD;gling to get as many peo&#xAD;ple vac&#xAD;ci&#xAD;nated as pos&#xAD;si&#xAD;ble.</p>
