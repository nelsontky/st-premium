    <p>Be­ing sep­a­rated from his par­ents dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker pe­riod gave so­cial en­tre­pre­neur Cai Yinzhou, 30, a taste of how mi­grant work­ers here felt be­ing away from their loved ones.</p>
    <p>When mea­sures were im­posed in early April to curb the spread of Covid-19, he co-founded the Covid-19 Mi­grant Sup­port Coali­tion, mo­bil­is­ing vol­un­teers across dif­fer­ent groups, such as Sin­ga­pore Mi­grant Friends, Mi­grants X Me and his own so­cial en­ter­prise, Cit­i­zen Ad­ven­tures, to as­sist those who not only had to en­dure the lock­down of their dor­mi­to­ries but were also far from home.</p>
    <p>His par­ents were stranded in Cen­tral Asia, where they had gone in Fe­bru­ary for vol­un­teer work. They were un­able to re­turn home when the pan­demic threw in­ter­na­tional travel into upheaval.</p>
    <p>“I re­alised how it felt to miss fam­ily and how cru­cial the fam­ily unit is in dif­fi­cult sea­sons of life,” said Mr Cai.</p>
    <p>“Many of the mi­grant work­ers’ fam­i­lies in their home coun­tries are un­em­ployed. Even though the work­ers in­stinc­tively want to be with their fam­i­lies dur­ing dif­fi­cult mo­ments like this, they know if they quit their job and leave, their fam­i­lies may suf­fer.”</p>
    <p>Be­sides meals, the coali­tion also dis­trib­uted es­sen­tial goods such as gro­ceries and toi­letries.</p>
    <p>By Septem­ber, it had de­liv­ered 1.7 mil­lion es­sen­tial goods and given out about 82,000 meals to mi­grant work­ers.</p>
    <p>For his con­tri­bu­tions to the com­mu­nity, Mr Cai was nom­i­nated for this year’s The Straits Times Sin­ga­porean of the Year award.</p>
    <p>He said the ef­forts to high­light the plight of mi­grant work­ers and as­sist them went be­yond him as an in­di­vid­ual and it in­cluded the many Sin­ga­pore­ans who pitched in.</p>
    <p>Grow­ing up in Gey­lang, Mr Cai, who has an older and a younger sis­ter, made friends with mi­grant work­ers i n the area, bond­ing over sports.</p>
    <p>He learnt more about their lives in Sin­ga­pore and was also deeply af­fected by their con­cerns as sole bread­win­ners.</p>
    <p>He said: “A com­mon thread was the sac­ri­fices they made just to come to Sin­ga­pore.”</p>
    <p>As Covid-19 cases here sta­bilise, Mr Cai has turned his fo­cus back to Cit­i­zen Ad­ven­tures, which con­ducts tours for peo­ple who want to un­der­stand so­cial ecosys­tems, and also other projects, such as Back­alley Bar­bers, which of­fers free hair­cuts to mi­grant work­ers, nurs­ing home res­i­dents and those who can­not af­ford to go to a bar­ber.</p>
    <p>Mr Cai said he will con­tinue to en­cour­age Sin­ga­pore­ans to think of their priv­i­leged po­si­tion in re­la­tion to so­cial inequities and the en­vi­ron­ment.</p>
    <p>“The work lies in prac­ti­cal ini­tia­tives to serve a par­tic­u­lar need, am­pli­fy­ing that through so­cial me­dia, ral­ly­ing peo­ple to­gether for a cause and then hav­ing con­ver­sa­tions about t he topic and mov­ing the nee­dle on the is­sue,” he added.</p>
