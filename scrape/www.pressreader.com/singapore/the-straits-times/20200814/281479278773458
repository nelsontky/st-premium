    <p>Troubled off­shore marine com­pany KS En­ergy has been dealt an­other blow after cred­i­tor OCBC is­sued let­ters of de­mand to the firm and its eight units to pay up out­stand­ing loans of US$230.7 mil­lion (S$316.3 mil­lion) and $10.3 mil­lion, or face le­gal ac­tion in­clud­ing a pos­si­ble wind­ing up.</p>
    <p>KS En­ergy, in a fil­ing to the Sin­ga­pore Ex­change on Wed­nes­day, said that, with the let­ters of de­mand, the com­pany “is un­able to rea­son­ably as­sess its fi­nan­cial po­si­tion”.</p>
    <p>The Straits Times un­der­stands that the loans are for the com­pany’s off­shore and marine op­er­a­tions.</p>
    <p>This comes just a week after its ex­ec­u­tive chair­man and chief ex­ec­u­tive Kris Wiluan was hit with 112 charges over al­leged mar­ket rig­ging and false trad­ing on Aug 5.</p>
    <p>The com­pany, when queried by SGX on Aug 6, de­fended his suit­abil­ity to re­main as head of the group.</p>
    <p>Shares of KS En­ergy last traded at 1.3 cents be­fore the com­pany re­quested a sus­pen­sion of trad­ing after Wed­nes­day’s mar­ket close.</p>
    <p>This is pend­ing a res­o­lu­tion of the mat­ter as KS En­ergy is now seek­ing le­gal ad­vice and en­gag­ing with OCBC to rem­edy the sit­u­a­tion.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to KS En­ergy, the bank is­sued a statu­tory de­mand dated Aug 6 for pay­ment of US$230.7 mil­lion and two other loans – $5.15 mil­lion and $5.16 mil­lion – within seven days of that date.</p>
    <p>The let­ters of de­mand fur­ther state that if each com­pany “fails to pay or se­cure or com­pound the out­stand­ing amounts to the rea­son­able sat­is­fac­tion of OCBC within six months from (Aug 6), OCBC shall be en­ti­tled to present a wind­ing-up or­der to be made against the com­pany”.</p>
    <p>The Straits Times un­der­stands that if the com­pany fails to make pay­ment by the dead­line, OCBC has to de­cide whether it will file le­gal pro­ceed­ings to ob­tain j udg­ment, or put the group into ju­di­cial man­age­ment, or wind it up.</p>
    <p>When asked, OCBC de­clined com­ment.</p>
    <p>In an SGX fil­ing last week, KS En­ergy de­fended the suit­abil­ity of Wiluan to re­main as ex­ec­u­tive chair­man and chief ex­ec­u­tive, say­ing that he “has not breached com­pany poli­cies in re­la­tion to his deal­ings in se­cu­ri­ties”.</p>
    <p>“The charges made i n court against Kris Wiluan by the CAD (Com­mer­cial Af­fairs Depart­ment) re­late to ac­tions in his per­sonal ca­pac­ity and do not re­late to ac­tions taken in his ca­pac­ity as a direc­tor of the com­pany,” KS En­ergy said.</p>
    <p>The firm also said Wiluan is cur­rently not dis­qual­i­fied from act­ing as a direc­tor of any com­pany, and that he has ex­po­sure and fa­mil­iar­ity with the busi­ness en­vi­ron­ment of the group’s op­er­a­tions in In­done­sia.</p>
    <p>Wiluan also as­sured KS En­ergy’s nom­i­nat­ing com­mit­tee sat­is­fac­to­rily that he can con­tinue to ful­fil his du­ties as the ex­ec­u­tive chair­man and CEO, the com­pany said.</p>
    <p>“There­fore, the nom­i­nat­ing com­mit­tee is of the view that the charges will not hin­der Kris Wiluan dis­charg­ing his du­ties. To the best of our knowl­edge, he has al­ways been up­front with the board and the di­rec­tors on com­pany mat­ters,” it added.</p>
    <p>When queried by SGX last week on whether Wiluan’s son Richard, an ex­ec­u­tive direc­tor, has posted bail or sur­ren­dered his pass­port, the com­pany said that he had not been charged and there­fore did not have to do ei­ther.</p>
    <p>The older Wiluan was ac­cused of giv­ing in­struc­tions, ei­ther per­son­ally or through Ho Chee Yen, to trad­ing rep­re­sen­ta­tives from CIMB Se­cu­ri­ties (Sin­ga­pore) to buy shares of KS En­ergy through the trad­ing ac­count of Pa­cific One En­ergy, a com­pany he con­trolled.</p>
    <p>The pur­pose was to “push up” the share price of main­board-listed KS En­ergy on 112 trad­ing days be­tween Dec 19, 2014 and Sept 13, 2016, ac­cord­ing to the Sin­ga­pore po­lice.</p>
    <p>KS En­ergy said Ho, 56, is not an em­ployee of the firm.</p>
    <p>But ac­cord­ing to the Sin­ga­pore po­lice, she is a man­ager em­ployed at the of­fice of the ex­ec­u­tive chair­man and CEO.</p>
    <p>Ho faces 92 counts of vi­o­lat­ing the Se­cu­ri­ties and Fu­tures Act for in­ten­tion­ally aid­ing Wiluan in the al­leged mar­ket rig­ging by re­lay­ing his in­struc­tions to CIMB trad­ing rep­re­sen­ta­tives Ngin Kim Choo and Yeo Jin Lui.</p>
    <p>KS En­ergy also said last week that none of its other di­rec­tors or man­age­ment has been in­ter­viewed by the CAD, and that no other em­ploy­ees are fac­ing charges or be­ing in­ves­ti­gated, to the best of its knowl­edge.</p>
