    <p>Jose Mour­inho can deny it.</p>
    <p>He can pre­tend Tot­ten­ham were dis­ap­pointed they did not win at Chelsea last week. Yet the ev­i­dence of both the naked eye and the statis­tics tells us a dif­fer­ent story: Spurs played for a stale­mate. They got one, too.</p>
    <p>It felt both typ­i­cal of Mour­inho, whose ap­proach can be­tray a lack of trust in his play­ers to go toe to toe with peers, and the wrong way to win the ti­tle now.</p>
    <p>Liver­pool had a soli­tary 0-0 draw last sea­son and they cer­tainly did not play for it.</p>
    <p>The last three even­tual cham­pi­ons ar­guably set out to get only one 0-0 draw: Manch­ester City’s An­field stale­mate in Oc­to­ber 2018.</p>
    <p>At­tack­ing philoso­phies meant they pur­sued an­other path. The stan­dards in sea­sons when the league was won with 100, 98 and 99 points meant they al­most elim­i­nated draws.</p>
    <p>Now they may be back. Po­ten­tially Mour­inho’s first ti­tle chal­lenge since 2015 feels a blast from the past in more ways than one.</p>
    <p>For starters, a record points tally will not be re­quired, so draws are more ac­cept­able, es­pe­cially if they stop ri­vals win­ning.</p>
    <p>The meth­ods are plucked from an ear­lier sea­son, too. Tot­ten­ham’s 51.5 per cent share of pos­ses­sion is re­spectable, but not re­mark­able. Liver­pool had 59.6, City a record-break­ing 66.4 and then 64.0.</p>
    <p>Spurs’ game plan is very dif­fer­ent: less pass­ing, less press­ing high up the field, a lower de­fen­sive line.</p>
    <p>Un­sur­pris­ingly, it has more to do with the blue­print Mour­inho used in 2005 than Pep Guardi­ola and Ju­r­gen Klopp’s more mod­ernistic think­ing.</p>
    <p>But foot­ball can be cycli­cal, so per­haps Mour­inho has come back in fash­ion.</p>
    <p>He be­lieves in a dif­fer­ent sort of dom­i­nance. Con­trol can be a state of mind and tac­ti­cal; it can come with­out the ball, not just with it. Tot­ten­ham may not dom­i­nate the sea­sonal statis­tics as City and Liver­pool have.</p>
    <p>They are among the top scor­ers now, but have only six goals in their last five league games. Mour­inho has won the Premier</p>
    <p>League with 72, 72 and 73 goals re­spec­tively; a cen­tury was not re­quired.</p>
    <p>The aus­pi­cious com­par­isons are not merely with his his­tory. Le­ices­ter were the great out­liers in many re­spects, win­ning the league with 81 points and 44.7 per cent of the ball.</p>
    <p>But they showed that sit­ting deep and counter-at­tack­ing at pace can be a po­tent for­mula.</p>
    <p>More per­ti­nent prece­dents may be Mour­inho’s 2014-15 Chelsea and An­to­nio Conte’s 2016-17 Blues; both had 54 per cent of the ball.</p>
    <p>Nei­ther topped the charts for pos­ses­sion, pass­ing ac­cu­racy or shot vol­ume. But both were clin­i­cal and or­gan­ised. Both had the men­tal strength not to sur­ren­der a lead in the ti­tle race.</p>
    <p>Conte was more tac­ti­cally in­no­va­tive and his team were more pro­lific but both sides were prag­matic cham­pi­ons.</p>
    <p>Tot­ten­ham outscored Chelsea then, in 2016-17. Now, as fans re­turn to grounds, sup­port­ers – and tro­phy-starved play­ers like Harry Kane – may be hap­pier with Mour­inho’s more de­fen­sive ploys. Neg­a­tiv­ity with­out suc­cess is de­mor­al­is­ing.</p>
    <p>But, with the prom­ise of glory, Spurs may savour the thought of the clock be­ing re­wound to the days when the bold­est team were not nec­es­sar­ily the best.</p>
    <p>(Jose Mour­inho) be­lieves in a dif­fer­ent sort of dom­i­nance. Con­trol can be a state of mind and tac­ti­cal; it can come with­out the ball, not just with it. Tot­ten­ham may not dom­i­nate the sea­sonal statis­tics as City and Liver­pool have... But they showed that sit­ting deep and counter-at­tackin g at pace can be a po­tent for­mula.</p>
