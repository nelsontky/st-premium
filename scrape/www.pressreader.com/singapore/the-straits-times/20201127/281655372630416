    <p>Te­masek Foun­da­tion will launch its third na­tion­wide re­us­able mask dis­tri­bu­tion ex­er­cise on Monday, and it will last un­til Dec 13, the foun­da­tion said in a state­ment yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>All Sin­ga­pore res­i­dents with a govern­ment-is­sued ID can col­lect one free mask kit each – con­tain­ing two black masks and three fil­ters – from 10am on Nov 30 at around 1,200 vend­ing ma­chines is­land­wide.</p>
    <p>They can be found at over 800 lo­ca­tions, in­clud­ing bus in­ter­changes, com­mu­nity cen­tres, res­i­dent com­mit­tee cen­tres, Te­masek Shop­house and Plaza Sin­ga­pura.</p>
    <p>The mask comes in four sizes – small, medium, large and ex­tra large. The small size is in­tended for chil­dren aged eight and be­low, and can be col­lected only at com­mu­nity cen­tres, Plaza Sin­ga­pura and Te­masek Shop­house.</p>
    <p>Full-sized mask siz­ing guides will be pub­lished in The Straits Times to­mor­row, and on Dec 5 and Dec 12. The guides can be cut out.</p>
    <p>Te­masek chief ex­ec­u­tive and ex­ec­u­tive di­rec­tor Ho Ching had an­nounced the dis­tri­bu­tion of these “breath­able an­timi­cro­bial 3D masks” from lo­cal com­pany Proshield in a Face­book post on Nov 19.</p>
    <p>The mask com­prises three lay­ers: An outer anti-bac­te­rial layer to re­pel wa­ter droplets, a fil­ter liner and an in­ner layer to ab­sorb saliva.</p>
    <p>It can be used with­out a fil­ter when one is ex­er­cis­ing or in less crowded en­vi­ron­ments.</p>
    <p>The three re­us­able fil­ters, made from nanofi­bre fab­ric, pro­tect wear­ers from saliva droplets or dust par­ti­cles.</p>
    <p>The fil­ters can be used with the new masks or with other masks that have fil­ter pock­ets.</p>
    <p>Both the masks and fil­ters may be washed up to 50 times, af­ter which the masks will have lower an­timi­cro­bial per­for­mance.</p>
    <p>Mem­bers of the pub­lic can also or­der ad­di­tional mask kits on­line or through the DBS PayLah! app for $12 each from 10am on Nov 30.</p>
    <p>They are ad­vised to pur­chase ad­di­tional masks af­ter try­ing on their free masks to check for fit and size, said Te­masek Foun­da­tion.</p>
    <p>Or­ders are lim­ited to five mask kits for sizes S and M, as well as no more than 10 mask kits for sizes L and XL.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing Te­masek’s pre­vi­ous dis­tri­bu­tion ex­er­cise from Septem­ber to last month, around 7.6 mil­lion free re­us­able an­timi­cro­bial masks were col­lected. In its first ex­er­cise from June to July, 9.3 mil­lion masks were col­lected.</p>
