    <p>•</p>
    <p>HANOI US-China ri­valry is set to dom­i­nate dis­cus­sions as the for­eign min­is­ters of the 10 South-east Asian coun­tries be­gan an on­line sum­mit yes­ter­day, with Wash­ing­ton’s top di­plo­mat ready to take aim at Bei­jing’s “bul­ly­ing” in the South China Sea.</p>
    <p>The meet­ing comes just days af­ter China launched bal­lis­tic mis­siles in the flash­point wa­ters as part of live-fire ex­er­cises and as Wash­ing­ton and Bei­jing clash over a range of is­sues from trade to the coro­n­avirus.</p>
    <p>The min­is­ters are be­ing joined by US Sec­re­tary of State Mike Pom­peo and his Chi­nese coun­ter­part Wang Yi for their first sum­mit since the US an­nounced sanc­tions on Chi­nese com­pa­nies over Bei­jing’s con­struc­tion of ar­ti­fi­cial is­lands in the dis­puted wa­ters.</p>
    <p>The re­source-rich South China Sea is claimed in its en­tirety by Bei­jing but is also con­tested by Viet­nam, the Philip­pines, Malaysia, Brunei and Tai­wan.</p>
    <p>A fresh spat be­tween China and the Philip­pines over Scar­bor­ough</p>
    <p>Shoal – one of the re­gion’s rich­est fish­ing grounds – also hangs over the talks.</p>
    <p>“The Chi­nese Com­mu­nist Party is en­gaged in a clear and in­ten­si­fy­ing pat­tern of bul­ly­ing its neigh­bours,” Mr Pom­peo said ahead of the sum­mit.</p>
    <p>Ten­sions over the Korean Penin­sula will also be high on the agenda. Talks be­tween Py­ongyang and Wash­ing­ton on North Korea’s nu­clear arse­nal have been stalled since the col­lapse of a Hanoi sum­mit be­tween leader Kim Jong Un and United States Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump last year.</p>
    <p>The coro­n­avirus pan­demic is set to fea­ture heav­ily in dis­cus­sions too, af­ter Viet­nam, the Asean cur­rent chair, warned at a meet­ing in June that the fall­out from the virus had swept away years of eco­nomic gains in the re­gion.</p>
    <p>Viet­namese Prime Min­is­ter Nguyen Xuan Phuc said in open­ing re­marks that “peo­ple and en­ter­prises are suf­fer­ing from huge losses” and “the geopo­lit­i­cal en­vi­ron­ment, re­gional econ­omy, in­clud</p>
    <p>ing that of the East Sea (South China Sea), are ex­pe­ri­enc­ing sev­eral up­heavals, in­flu­enc­ing peace and sta­bil­ity”.</p>
    <p>The “power ri­valry” be­tween the US and China will likely steal the lime­light, a se­nior South-east Asian di­plo­mat told AFP, speak­ing on con­di­tion of anonymity.</p>
    <p>“The United States and China will likely use the meet­ings as a plat­form to throw ev­ery­thing at each other,” he said.</p>
    <p>Smaller coun­tries will “say their usual lines” and then take cover as Wash­ing­ton and Bei­jing fight, Mr Nguyen added.</p>
    <p>Fric­tion be­tween the two pow­ers is al­ready high over trade, blame for the coro­n­avirus pan­demic and China’s poli­cies in Hong Kong, where Bei­jing has im­posed a dra­co­nian na­tional se­cu­rity law.</p>
    <p>There is also angst that the virus may have pro­vided cover for China to make new plays in the South China Sea.</p>
    <p>Dr Zachary Abuza, an ex­pert on South-east Asian pol­i­tics and se­cu­rity is­sues at the Na­tional War Col­lege in Wash­ing­ton, said there was un­likely to be much progress in talks over the dis­puted wa­ters.</p>
    <p>“China has ef­fec­tively used Covid-19 as­sis­tance and prom­ises of vac­cines – and tri­als in the Philip­pines and In­done­sia – to re­ally try to quash any di­plo­matic mo­men­tum to­wards a dis­cus­sion of the South China Sea,” he said.</p>
    <p>The coro­n­avirus pan­demic is set to fea­ture heav­ily in dis­cus­sions too, af­ter Viet­nam, the cur­rent Asean chair, warned at a meet­ing in June that the fall­out from the virus had swept away years of eco­nomic gains in the re­gion.</p>
