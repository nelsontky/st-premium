    <p>Mr B. Jayaku­mar and his wife Sen­tha wanted to bask in the pres­ence of the Hindu god­dess Mari­amman on the first day of the Aadi month last Thurs­day, some­thing they felt could not be repli­cated on the live streams that Sri Mari­amman Tem­ple beams daily.</p>
    <p>“Espe­cially to­day, we both wanted to be in the tem­ple to re­ceive the god­dess’ dar­shan (blessed view),” says the 49-yearold ma­rine man­ager, who works in the oil and gas in­dus­try.</p>
    <p>They be­lieve that the op­por­tu­nity to see the im­age of the de­ity in the tem­ple is a bless­ing in it­self.</p>
    <p>The month of Aadi in the Tamil cal­en­dar, from last Thurs­day to Aug 15 this year, is tra­di­tion­ally re­served for re­li­gious ob­ser­vances for the Hindu fe­male trin­ity.</p>
    <p>“We wanted to be in­side the tem­ple, as we have done since we were young,” says Mr Jayaku­mar.</p>
    <p>Sri Mari­amman Tem­ple in South Bridge Road, built in 1827, has gone high-tech to pre­serve the con­ti­nu­ity of Hin­duism’s 5,000-year-old rites and re­li­gious ob­ser­vances, yet en­sure the safety of devo­tees dur­ing the coro­n­avirus pan­demic.</p>
    <p>The grand dame of Sin­ga­pore tem­ples has boosted on­line of­fer­ings for devo­tees through the live stream­ing of daily morn­ing and evening prayers since March.</p>
    <p>And not a mo­ment too soon, as ma­jor Hindu fes­ti­vals, which usu­ally draw crowds of up to 1,000 in the tem­ple, have started since last Thurs­day.</p>
    <p>Af­ter Aadi month comes the an­nual Navara­tri, or Nine Nights of the God­dess, and Theemithi, or Fire­walk­ing fes­ti­val, which this year has been short­ened from three months to just one, cul­mi­nat­ing in the fire­walk­ing rit­ual on Nov 1.</p>
    <p>The Hindu En­dow­ments Board (HEB), which man­ages four ma­jor tem­ples in Sin­ga­pore – Sri Mari­amman Tem­ple, Sri Srini­vasa Peru­mal Tem­ple, Sri Vairav­i­mada Kaliamman Tem­ple and Sri Si­van Tem­ple – has put in place a raft of mea­sures to pre­pare for fes­ti­val sea­son.</p>
    <p>Be­sides the manda­tory SafeEn­try check-ins, there are also a bar­ri­cade sys­tem to di­rect the flow of devo­tees seek­ing dar­shan of the god­dess Mari­amman, ther­mal scan­ners for tem­per­a­ture mon­i­tor­ing and a re­vamped tick­et­ing sys­tem for the book­ing for prayer slots which in­clude tem­ple of­fer­ings.</p>
    <p>Be­sides all these, HEB also main­tains a ded­i­cated YouTube chan­nel, which live-streams morn­ing and evening prayers from its four tem­ples for those who want to avoid crowds.</p>
    <p>“We want to avoid can­celling tem­ple events,” says Mr Raja Se­gar, 58, HEB’s chief ex­ec­u­tive of­fi­cer.</p>
    <p>“In­stead, we plan to do more live stream­ing so that devo­tees are able to par­take of the cer­e­monies, but from the safety of their homes. This way, we pre­serve the con­ti­nu­ity of the yearly events with­out com­pro­mis­ing the safety of devo­tees.”</p>
    <p>YouTube videos of daily ri­tu­als of the four HEB-man­aged tem­ples get be­tween 200 and 300 views daily. Hindu fes­ti­vals garner more hits on­line, up­wards of 1,000 view­ers. Most pop­u­lar are the fire­walk­ing cer­e­mony videos, which cap­ture up to 100,000 eye­balls.</p>
    <p>The HEB chan­nel now has nearly 15,000 sub­scribers, but Mr Se­gar ex­pects an uptick in the lead-up to Deep­avali in Novem­ber. Like­wise, the four tem­ples com­bined get be­tween 800 and 2,000 vis­i­tors on-site a day, a fig­ure which has been ris­ing since the phase two re­open­ing on June 19.</p>
    <p>Look­ing for­ward, be­yond the coro­n­avirus scourge, Mr Se­gar and his team are putting in place a “dig­i­tal dharma” plan for the longer term, which in­volves in­creased en­gage­ment on­line and broader out­reach be­yond Sin­ga­pore’s shores.</p>
    <p>“We are look­ing at how to fa­cil­i­tate faster book­ings via our website for tem­ple prayer slots, for not only Hin­dus res­i­dents of Sin­ga­pore, but also non-res­i­dent devo­tees who have mi­grated over­seas and want to main­tain a link with Sri Mari­amman Tem­ple,” he says.</p>
    <p>While the essence of Hindu wor­ship will re­main un­touched by the march of time, he says the way devo­tees pray will change rad­i­cally. There will be more vir­tual op­tions to pray from home, book tick­ets on­line in­stead of queu­ing at the tem­ple, and the flex­i­bil­ity to com­bine vir­tual with phys­i­cal vis­its to the tem­ple.</p>
    <p>How­ever, he ac­knowl­edges that not all Hindu tem­ples have the re­sources to go dig­i­tal. There are 20 pri­vately run Hindu tem­ples, some with­out a sig­nif­i­cant on­line pres­ence.</p>
    <p>Pri­vately run Sri Arasake­sari Si­van Tem­ple in Sungei Kadut Avenue does not live-stream its prayers sessions, but shares some in­for­ma­tion pre­dom­i­nantly via its website.</p>
    <p>It now al­lows up to 25 devo­tees into the tem­ple at a time to com­plete their prayers and dis­cour­ages lin­ger­ing on the premises.</p>
    <p>“Devo­tees have only about five min­utes to com­plete their prayers,” says its head priest, Mr Praba Gu­rukkal, 49, in Tamil.</p>
    <p>Prior to Covid-19, devo­tees used to wash their feet at the clean­ing sta­tion out­side the tem­ple, which is equipped with taps, be­fore en­ter­ing. Now, there is also a SafeEn­try check-in sys­tem and con­tact­less tem­per­a­ture scan­ning, and hand sani­tis­ers are placed through­out the tem­ple.</p>
    <p>“We ex­plain to devo­tees that these mea­sures are for their own safety, and that they also need to be con­sid­er­ate to oth­ers queue­ing out­side,” says Mr Praba.</p>
    <p>Over at two of Sin­ga­pore’s gur­d­waras (tem­ples), the Cen­tral Sikh Tem­ple in Towner Road and the Si­lat Road Sikh Tem­ple, com­mu­nity spirit – a cen­tral pil­lar of Sikhism – is now fa­cil­i­tated vir­tu­ally.</p>
    <p>This is af­ter a num­ber of re­li­gious ser­vices, in­clud­ing classes and lang­gar – cater­ing and serv­ing food in the tem­ples – were sus­pended in March.</p>
    <p>But Mr Baljit Singh, pres­i­dent of the Cen­tral Sikh Gur­d­wara Board (CSGB), says the in­sti­tu­tion of lang­gar has con­tin­ued through the cir­cuit breaker, with packed meals, in­stead of sit-down meals.</p>
    <p>More than 12,000 lang­gar meals con­tinue to be served ev­ery week by the seven gur­d­waras in Sin­ga­pore to both lo­cals and non-lo­cals.</p>
    <p>“The Cen­tral and Si­lat Road Sikh tem­ples con­tinue to sup­port the com­mu­nity spirit through on­go­ing phys­i­cal prayer within safe prac­tice guide­lines,” says Mr Singh, 59.</p>
    <p>One area that has been ramped up is the vir­tual stream­ing of prayers to keep the com­mu­nity con­nected. CSGB also con­nects through monthly bul­letins, a ded­i­cated website, Face­book and var­i­ous chat groups.</p>
    <p>“More im­por­tantly, new pro­grammes in­volv­ing in­ter­ac­tive Zoom dis­cus­sions on spe­cific re­li­gious top­ics among our con­gre­ga­tion have kept the con­nec­tiv­ity go­ing,” says Mr Singh.</p>
    <p>He adds that the num­ber of classes a week has in­creased three­fold, with at­ten­dance spik­ing six­fold since the cir­cuit breaker.</p>
    <p>“It was re­fresh­ing to see stu­dents not only from Sin­ga­pore, but also from places as far away as Aus­tralia and In­dia at­tend­ing our on­line sessions,” he says.</p>
