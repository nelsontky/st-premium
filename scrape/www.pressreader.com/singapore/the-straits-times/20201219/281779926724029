    <p>Mal­nu­tri­tion ap­pears to be deep­en­ing in a wor­ry­ing trend for In­dia, al­ready home to the high­est num­ber of mal­nour­ished chil­dren in the world.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to re­cently re­leased find­ings from the Na­tional Fam­ily Health Sur­vey 2019-2020, con­ducted be­fore the pan­demic, over a dozen out of 22 states sur­veyed recorded an in­crease in un­der­weight and se­verely wasted chil­dren un­der the age of five.</p>
    <p>In the state of Ma­ha­rash­tra, for in­stance, chil­dren who are se­verely wasted – a way of gaug­ing mal­nu­tri­tion – went up from 9.4 per cent in 2015-2016 to 10.9 per cent in 2019-2020.</p>
    <p>Ex­perts said it was dif­fi­cult to pin­point any sin­gle rea­son for the cur­rent in­crease in mal­nu­tri­tion lev­els and pointed to a com­bi­na­tion of fac­tors such as a slow­ing econ­omy and growth in job­less­ness well be­fore the pan­demic. Growth had touched a six-year low of 4.7 per cent in the fi­nal quar­ter of last year.</p>
    <p>Though data is lim­ited, ex­perts were not sur­prised mal­nu­tri­tion would fol­low on the heels of slower eco­nomic growth, said Dr Purn­ima Menon, se­nior re­search fel­low at the In­ter­na­tional Food Pol­icy Re­search In­sti­tute.</p>
    <p>This is de­spite the POSHAN Ab­hiyaan, the govern­ment’s flag­ship pro­gramme to im­prove nu­tri­tional out­comes for chil­dren, preg­nant women and lac­tat­ing moth­ers, which was launched in March 2018.</p>
    <p>The sur­vey looked at 307,554 house­holds in 22 states. Data for the other 14 states in In­dia was dis­rupted by the pan­demic and is set to be re­leased next year.</p>
    <p>In­dia has the largest child pop­u­la­tion at 472 mil­lion but also faces the prob­lem of one in three chil­dren be­ing mal­nour­ished.</p>
    <p>Mal­nu­tri­tion is seen to be caused by a range of fac­tors, in­clud­ing liveli­hood dis­rup­tions, overde­pen­dence on ce­re­als, poverty, low lit­er­acy, poor san­i­ta­tion and a lack of clean drink­ing wa­ter.</p>
    <p>In 2012, then Prime Min­is­ter Man­mo­han Singh called high mal­nu­tri­tion rates among chil­dren a “na­tional shame”.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to the Global Nu­tri­tion Re­port 2018, 46 mil­lion chil­dren in In­dia are stunted – mean­ing they are short for their age – be­cause of mal­nu­tri­tion, and 25.5 mil­lion are wasted, or dan­ger­ously thin.</p>
    <p>There are con­cerns that the coro­n­avirus pan­demic will fur­ther deepen the cri­sis as it has led to dis­rup­tions to govern­ment pro­grammes such as free school meals and free im­mu­ni­sa­tion.</p>
    <p>Free mid­day meals are pro­vided in govern­ment schools across the coun­try as a way to bring poorer stu­dents into the school sys­tem. But schools have been forced to shut ow­ing to the pan­demic. Some states have started de­liv­er­ing meals or cash to stu­dents’ homes.</p>
    <p>The govern­ment, as part of a coro­n­avirus pan­demic eco­nomic pack­age, also pro­vided 5kg of rice or wheat to the poor. But th­ese mea­sures will not be enough, said non-gov­ern­men­tal groups.</p>
    <p>Mr Sachin Ku­mar Jain, a rep­re­sen­ta­tive of the Right to Food Cam­paign, said: “Covid is go­ing to make it worse due to non-func­tion­ing of ser­vices and deep­en­ing of liveli­hood in­se­cu­ri­ties. Mal­nu­tri­tion is go­ing to go up.”</p>
    <p>Still, the sur­vey had some pos­i­tive news in that the in­fant mor­tal­ity rate (IMR) and that of chil­dren un­der five have come down in 18 states. In the south­ern state of Andhra Pradesh, the IMR fell from 34.9 per cent to 30 per cent.</p>
    <p>The prob­lem of mal­nu­tri­tion is not an iso­lated is­sue for In­dia or South Asia. What hap­pens in In­dia also im­pacts global ef­forts to end all forms of hunger and mal­nu­tri­tion by 2030, one of the United Na­tions Sus­tain­able De­vel­op­ment Goals. Ex­perts be­lieve In­dia needs to adopt a se­ries of mea­sures in­clud­ing in­te­grat­ing poverty al­le­vi­a­tion pro­grammes with nu­tri­tion.</p>
    <p>“In­dia’s nu­tri­tional strat­egy needs to now fully bring in the im­por­tance of poverty al­le­vi­a­tion work that lies ahead. Poverty and food se­cu­rity have to ac­com­pany the nu­tri­tion agenda. That’s how ac­cel­er­a­tion can hap­pen and close eq­uity gaps,” said Dr Menon.</p>
    <p>Mr Jain said: “Govern­ment pro­grammes (alone) won’t be able to help us be­yond a point. We need an in­te­grated com­mu­nity-based ap­proach... For in­stance, if I go to a tribal com­mu­nity, they use their own word for nu­tri­tion. We never com­mu­ni­cate in their di­alect and that’s why we are not able to put for­ward the mes­sage.”</p>
    <p>He added: “If In­dia doesn’t man­age this prob­lem, it means the globe will not elim­i­nate mal­nu­tri­tion.”</p>
