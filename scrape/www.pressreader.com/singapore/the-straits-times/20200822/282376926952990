    <p>• More than half of the Ja­panese com­pa­nies that were in­ter­viewed feel the Tokyo Olympic Games, orig­i­nally planned for this sum­mer but post­poned for a year ow­ing to the coro­n­avirus pan­demic, should be can­celled or put off again, a sur­vey by a Ja­panese think-tank has found.</p>
    <p>Of some 13,000 com­pa­nies that re­sponded to the poll by Tokyo</p>
    <p>Shoko Re­search, 27.8 per cent said the qua­dren­nial sport­ing ex­trav­a­ganza should be axed, while 25.8 per cent saw an­other de­lay as de­sir­able.</p>
    <p>Ja­pan lifted in late May a state of emer­gency im­posed to slow down the spread of Covid-19 af­ter record­ing fewer in­fec­tions, but cases have been on the rise since last month. The coun­try had about 60,000 cases and more that 1,150 deaths.</p>
    <p>“With the end of the spread of in­fec­tion nowhere in sight, com­pa­nies are di­vided into for and against hold­ing the event in 2021,” the re­search group said in a re­port pub­lished on Thurs­day.</p>
    <p>Of the com­pa­nies that were sur­veyed, 22.5 per cent felt the Tokyo Games, sched­uled to start next July, should be held as planned, while 18.4 per cent said they ought to be held with fewer spec­ta­tors and 5.3 per cent called for a closed­door event.</p>
    <p>The poll was con­ducted over the In­ter­net be­tween late last month and early this month.</p>
    <p>Last month, an­other sur­vey done by Ky­odo News Agency found that just one in four peo­ple in Ja­pan wanted to see the Tokyo Games held next year, with most back­ing ei­ther a fur­ther de­lay or can­cel­la­tion.</p>
    <p>A re­cent poll by the Asahi Shim­bun news­pa­per also re­vealed that only 33 per cent of re­spon­dents backed the stag­ing of the Olympics, with 61 per cent sup­port­ing an­other post­pone­ment or scrap­ping it all to­gether.</p>
