    <p>LANS­ING (Michi­gan) Hours af­ter the fed­eral au­thor­i­ties charged six peo­ple with at­tempt­ing to kid­nap Michi­gan Gover­nor Gretchen Whit­mer, she held a press con­fer­ence and blamed Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump for cre­at­ing an en­vi­ron­ment that en­cour­ages such rad­i­cal crim­i­nal be­hav­iour.</p>
    <p>“Our head of state has spent the past seven months deny­ing science, ig­nor­ing his own health ex­perts, stok­ing dis­trust, fo­ment­ing anger and giv­ing com­fort to those who spread fear and ha­tred and di­vi­sion,” Ms Whit­mer told reporters in Lans­ing, the state cap­i­tal.</p>
    <p>“Last week,” she said, “the pres­i­dent of the United States stood be­fore the Amer­i­can peo­ple and re­fused to con­demn white su­prem­a­cists and hate groups like these two Michi­gan mili­tia groups. Stand back and stand by, he told them.”</p>
    <p>Ms Whit­mer said on Thurs­day that hate groups heard the pres­i­dent’s words “not as a re­buke, but as a ral­ly­ing cry, as a call to ac­tion”.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump later lashed out at Ms Whit­mer in a se­ries of Twit­ter posts. In one, he said the fed­eral au­thor­i­ties “had foiled a dan­ger­ous plot against the Gover­nor of Michi­gan. Rather than say thank you, she calls me a White Su­prem­a­cist”.</p>
    <p>He con­tin­ued the crit­i­cism in a phone in­ter­view with Fox News’ Sean Han­nity on Thurs­day night.</p>
    <p>Michi­gan At­tor­ney-Gen­eral Dana Nes­sel said six peo­ple had been charged with plot­ting to kid­nap Ms Whit­mer as part of a plan to over­throw the state’s govern­ment.</p>
    <p>The sus­pects al­legedly staked out Ms Whit­mer’s va­ca­tion home and planned to set off ex­plo­sives to dis­tract po­lice while they kid­napped the gover­nor.</p>
    <p>The US said it would also bring charges against seven other peo­ple con­nected to the Wolver­ine Watch­men mili­tia for at­tempts to tar­get law en­force­ment of­fi­cers and start a civil war.</p>
    <p>Demo­cratic pres­i­den­tial nom­i­nee Joe Bi­den, who spoke with Ms Whit­mer ear­lier in the day, com­pli­mented the Fed­eral Bureau of In­ves­ti­ga­tion and po­lice for han­dling the mat­ter and crit­i­cised Mr Trump.</p>
    <p>“The words of a pres­i­dent mat­ter,” Mr Bi­den said. “They can cause a na­tion to have the market rise or fall, go to war, make peace, but they can also breathe oxy­gen into those who are filled with hate and dan­ger. And I just think it’s got to stop.”</p>
    <p>Ms Whit­mer’s com­ments are the lat­est chap­ter in a run­ning feud with Mr Trump. She ac­cused him of be­ing slow to de­liver med­i­cal sup­plies in March when the coro­n­avirus pan­demic was spread­ing rapidly in her state. Mr Trump crit­i­cised Ms Whit­mer for not swiftly re­open­ing the Michi­gan econ­omy.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump told Vice-Pres­i­dent Mike Pence at a White House brief­ing in late March: “Don’t call the woman in Michi­gan.”</p>
    <p>That prompted her sup­port­ers to don T-shirts with the tagline “That Woman From Michi­gan”.</p>
    <p>Ms Whit­mer said dur­ing the press con­fer­ence she never ex­pected to have her life threat­ened as gover­nor. “When I put my hand on the Bi­ble and took the oath of of­fice 22 months ago, I knew this job would be hard, but I’ll be hon­est, I never could have imag­ined any­thing like this,” she said.</p>
    <p>The pan­demic has cre­ated a deep po­lit­i­cal di­vide in the state where Ms Whit­mer ini­ti­ated some of the na­tion’s tough­est man­dates to stop the spread of the virus. That led to crit­i­cism from Mr Trump and Repub­li­can lead­ers in the state.</p>
    <p>Marches against her or­ders were or­gan­ised and an armed protest at the capi­tol led to the can­cel­la­tion of a leg­isla­tive ses­sion.</p>
    <p>Ms Whit­mer’s mea­sures have been ef­fec­tive in slow­ing the virus’ spread. In early April, the state had more than 2,000 new cases a day. The num­ber has since dropped to fewer than 1,000 new cases on some days and un­der 100 on oth­ers. The state’s unem­ploy­ment rate fell to 8.7 per cent in Au­gust from more than 10 per cent in June.</p>
