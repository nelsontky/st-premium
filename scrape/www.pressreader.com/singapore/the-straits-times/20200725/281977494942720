    <p>The Covid-19 pan­demic has seen gov­ern­ments around the world un­leash un­prece­dented fis­cal fire­power to save jobs and help work­ers. Just how much more help is needed, as well as the role that gov­ern­ments and so­ci­eties play in nav­i­gat­ing a post-Covid-19 world, was at the heart of a Lee Kuan Yew School of Pub­lic Pol­icy dis­cus­sion this week. Given the out­break’s deep eco­nomic and so­cial im­pact, there are those who call for the state to still play a larger role. But they must recog­nise that a coun­try’s size and the re­sources at its dis­posal are not all that mat­ter. It is not pru­dent or sus­tain­able for gov­ern­ments to spend their way out of a pro­longed cri­sis. First, the pan­demic’s na­ture makes it hard to know when the global econ­omy will re­turn to nor­mal. Sec­ond, fur­lough schemes and other mea­sures have pushed bud­get deficits to lev­els un­seen since the global fi­nan­cial cri­sis. Third, the age of rapid and sus­tained real growth no longer ex­ists; and fi­nally, there is the dan­ger of busi­nesses and work­ers de­vel­op­ing a crutch men­tal­ity. In Amer­ica, for in­stance, un­em­ploy­ment ben­e­fits have had un­in­tended con­se­quences, such as un­em­ployed work­ers earn­ing more while out of work than when they had a job.</p>
    <p>Gov­ern­ments must in­stead fo­cus re­sources on what mat­ters most and do them well. As growth slows and so­ci­eties age, a pri­or­ity is to fos­ter in­clu­sion by pro­vid­ing key pub­lic goods and ser­vices, such as health­care, ed­u­ca­tion, in­fra­struc­ture and so­cial safety nets. Be­yond this, they can serve as cat­a­lysts, lever­ag­ing the en­er­gies and ideas of peo­ple, civil so­ci­ety and in­dus­try to achieve goals. The Emerg­ing Stronger Task­force here urged the Gov­ern­ment to be open to so­lu­tions by the pri­vate sec­tor on how to re­ha­bil­i­tate strug­gling com­pa­nies – a role re­ver­sal from the past, when the pub­lic sec­tor set the di­rec­tion and the pri­vate sec­tor car­ried out the im­ple­men­ta­tion.</p>
    <p>While the state may ex­ert a broader and deeper reach across the econ­omy in the im­me­di­ate fu­ture, com­pa­nies too, must do their part and pro­vide at­tach­ments and trainee­ships to af­fected work­ers and new job en­trants. Work­ers should use the down­time to up­skill and reskill, and take up train­ing places even if these do not yet lead to a per­ma­nent job. This en­sures they are well placed for op­por­tu­ni­ties when the econ­omy re­cov­ers.</p>
    <p>All this re­quires a strong so­cial com­pact, where those who are bet­ter off make more con­tri­bu­tions, and the bal­ance of ben­e­fits leans to­wards the poor and the mid­dle-in­come. It means build­ing a cul­ture of col­lec­tive re­spon­si­bil­ity and trust, where in­di­vid­u­als, the pub­lic sec­tor and cor­po­rates col­lab­o­rate to keep peo­ple en­gaged at work and on a path of ac­cu­mu­lat­ing skills. It takes a cri­sis to refocus on the fun­da­men­tals. Strong so­cial com­pacts, where ev­ery­one pulls to­gether, make for so­ci­eties and economies that are bet­ter pre­pared to face a dis­rupted fu­ture.</p>
