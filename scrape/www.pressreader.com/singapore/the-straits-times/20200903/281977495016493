    <p>It would be easy to dis­miss the Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion’s cam­paign against Chi­nese apps TikTok and WeChat as part of an elec­tion strat­egy to at­tack China from all an­gles.</p>
    <p>The moves, how­ever, as well as China’s counter-re­sponse, are con­tribut­ing to a deeper prob­lem at the heart of the global econ­omy – one that can’t be re­solved un­less the world’s two big­gest economies work together.</p>
    <p>Just as oil opened new pos­si­bil­i­ties for trade in the last cen­tury, data has be­come the lifeblood of trade growth in the 21st cen­tury.</p>
    <p>Trade in dig­i­tal ser­vices, in­clud­ing apps such as TikTok, is boom­ing. Data flows in­creas­ingly un­der­pin trade in phys­i­cal goods, too, sup­port­ing com­plex global value chains and emerg­ing tech­nolo­gies such as blockchain, ar­ti­fi­cial in­tel­li­gence and the In­ter­net of Things.</p>
    <p>The amount of cross-bor­der band­width in use in­creased 148 times between 2005 and 2017, ac­cord­ing to con­sul­tants McKin­sey and Co.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, how­ever, global trade rules have barely changed since the 1990s. In ef­fect, the world is try­ing to run a 21st-cen­tury, cloud-based econ­omy on the equiv­a­lent of Win­dows 95.</p>
    <p>In the ab­sence of shared global norms on how data flows should be gov­erned, do­mes­tic pol­i­cy­mak­ers ev­ery­where are de­vel­op­ing their own “patches” to reg­u­late data and pro­tect na­tional se­cu­rity and their cit­i­zens’ pri­vacy.</p>
    <p>The Euro­pean Union im­ple­mented its Gen­eral Data Pro­tec­tion Reg­u­la­tion in 2018. China has passed a sweep­ing cy­ber-se­cu­rity law and, like In­dia, is work­ing on a ma­jor data pro­tec­tion law.</p>
    <p>If the United States has been slower to reg­u­late data, this is partly be­cause it still dom­i­nates the in­dus­tries and net­work ar­chi­tec­ture that han­dle global dig­i­tal flows. Yet, given ris­ing con­cerns about China’s ac­cess to Amer­i­cans’ per­sonal data, the tide of opin­ion there, too, is turn­ing.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to the Or­gan­i­sa­tion for Eco­nomic Co­op­er­a­tion and De­vel­op­ment, the num­ber of data reg­u­la­tions has risen from around 50 world­wide in the early 2000s to just un­der 250 last year.</p>
    <p>The over­all de­gree of data con­trol, as mea­sured by the Euro­pean Cen­tre for In­ter­na­tional Po­lit­i­cal Econ­omy’s Dig­i­tal Trade Restric­tive­ness In­dex, has dou­bled in the past decade.</p>
    <p>The patch­work na­ture of these rules is cre­at­ing com­plex­ity for firms and fric­tion between na­tions.</p>
    <p>Just since the start of July, aside from US Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump’s ex­ec­u­tive or­ders against TikTok and WeChat, In­dia has banned 59 Chi­nese apps, and the Euro­pean Court of Jus­tice struck down the Pri­vacy Shield mech­a­nism, which US firms such as Face­book and Twit­ter had been us­ing to han­dle per­sonal data from the EU.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, the US is locked in dis­putes over dig­i­tal tax­a­tion with sev­eral Euro­pean coun­tries.</p>
    <p>Dif­fer­ent coun­tries nat­u­rally have dif­fer­ent views, val­ues and ca­pa­bil­i­ties re­gard­ing data gover­nance. All should have the right to reg­u­late data as they see fit for pur­poses of na­tional se­cu­rity.</p>
    <p>At the same time, the world needs to lay down some com­mon rules for how to man­age data, or such con­flicts will only pro­lif­er­ate and sti­fle in­ter­op­er­abil­ity, in­vest­ment and in­no­va­tion.</p>
    <p>Some bi­lat­eral and regional agree­ments have be­gun to forge such com­mon standards.</p>
    <p>The e-com­merce chap­ter in the Com­pre­hen­sive and Pro­gres­sive Agree­ment for Trans-Pa­cific Part­ner­ship al­lows mem­bers to reg­u­late data flows in a rules-based way that min­imises bar­ri­ers to trade.</p>
    <p>If China were to join the agree­ment – an idea gain­ing trac­tion in Chi­nese pol­i­cy­mak­ing cir­cles – this would help align the coun­try with next-gen­er­a­tion data gover­nance norms and sup­port the as­pi­ra­tions of Chi­nese tech­nol­ogy firms to “go global”.</p>
    <p>What’s re­ally re­quired, though, is a mul­ti­lat­eral data gover­nance regime that in­cludes both China and the US.</p>
    <p>The first step is to com­plete on­go­ing World Trade Or­gan­i­sa­tion (WTO) ne­go­ti­a­tions on e-com­merce. These talks should aim to set global ground rules and ex­cep­tions for data, while up­hold­ing the cen­tral­ity of the WTO sys­tem.</p>
    <p>Next, the G-20 should build on last year’s Osaka Dec­la­ra­tion on Dig­i­tal Econ­omy, which af­firmed the need for in­ter­na­tional pol­icy dis­cus­sions to max­imise the ben­e­fits of dig­i­tal­i­sa­tion.</p>
    <p>A “Dig­i­tal 20” (D-20), com­prised of the world’s 20 largest dig­i­tal com­pa­nies, should bring together fig­ures from gov­ern­ment, in­dus­try, academia and non-gov­ern­men­tal or­gan­i­sa­tions to de­velop a work­able, fact-based ap­proach that safe­guards na­tional se­cu­rity while pro­vid­ing con­sumers with trust and pri­vacy, and busi­nesses with clar­ity and pre­dictabil­ity.</p>
    <p>The US and China are home to most of these big tech com­pa­nies. Rather than treat­ing each other’s firms as na­tional se­cu­rity threats, lead­ers in both coun­tries should seek in­dus­try con­sen­sus and best prac­tices that can be used to es­tab­lish global standards.</p>
    <p>To re­as­sure se­cu­rity hawks on both sides, the world will need clear standards to judge what con­sti­tutes se­cure data man­age­ment practice.</p>
    <p>Coun­tries should be en­cour­aged to use in­ter­na­tional standards as bench­marks for do­mes­tic ap­proaches, such as ISO 27000 in­for­ma­tion se­cu­rity standards.</p>
    <p>Rules-based free trade was cru­cial in help­ing the global econ­omy re­cover from the rav­ages of World War II. We now face the worst global re­ces­sion since then. It is time to haul our mul­ti­lat­eral trade rules into the 21st cen­tury and stem the tide of dig­i­tal pro­tec­tion­ism so that data flows can be a source of growth and op­por­tu­nity, not dis­cord.</p>
