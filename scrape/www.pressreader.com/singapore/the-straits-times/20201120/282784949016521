    <p>Af­ter a marine bi­ol­o­gist called out local getai host and In­ter­net star Wang Lei for pro­mot­ing jew­ellery prod­ucts made from the shells of gi­ant clams, an en­dan­gered species, Wang has clar­i­fied that he did not know the species was un­der threat.</p>
    <p>The 59-year-old star told The Straits Times over the phone that he was en­gaged to do a live-stream ses­sion for the jew­ellery sup­plier.</p>
    <p>He says in Man­darin: “I was given the prod­ucts to sell, so I sold them. I didn’t know the species was en­dan­gered.”</p>
    <p>In a live stream posted on Face­book last Tues­day that has since been deleted, Wang pro­moted the sale of pearl ac­ces­sories along­side a fe­male pro­moter.</p>
    <p>She showed a sign which claimed that pearls made from gi­ant clams can help to re­solve mis­for­tunes and keep evil at bay.</p>
    <p>In the com­ments sec­tion of the live stream, Sin­ga­porean marine bi­ol­o­gist Neo Mei Lin told Wang that gi­ant clams are an in­ter­na­tion­ally pro­tected species, un­der Cites (Con­ven­tion on In­ter­na­tional Trade i n En­dan­gered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora).</p>
    <p>Gi­ant clams are pro­tected un­der Ap­pendix II of Cites – in which ex­port per­mits are nec­es­sary for trade of such spec­i­mens.</p>
    <p>In an in­ter­view with The Straits Times, Ms Neo, a marine bi­ol­o­gist work­ing at the Trop­i­cal Marine Sci­ence In­sti­tute, Na­tional Univer­sity of Sin­ga­pore, says she was alerted to the live stream by a friend.</p>
    <p>The 34-year-old says of such prod­ucts: “With­out any doc­u­men­ta­tion, these prod­ucts are con­sid­ered il­le­gally shipped to the coun­try. There­fore, I wanted to raise aware­ness of the plight of these an­i­mals, as well as the le­gal im­pli­ca­tions of sell­ing these prod­ucts with­out per­mits.”</p>
    <p>She adds: “Peo­ple might not even be aware that the source of their beads and jew­ellery comes from a threat­ened marine life and their con­sumerism could drive the species to ex­tinc­tion.</p>
    <p>“I hope through shar­ing this, peo­ple will be able to ap­pre­ci­ate that they can do their part to re­duce de­mand of such prod­ucts and, in the longer term, pre­vent the species from be­ing over­ex­ploited.”</p>
    <p>Wang says he will be more care­ful in the fu­ture when tak­ing up of­fers to pro­mote and sell items.</p>
    <p>He adds: “There are so many types of seashells. How do I know which are en­dan­gered and which are not? If I did, I would have been a pro­fes­sor in­stead of an on­line sales­man.”</p>
