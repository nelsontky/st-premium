    <p>•</p>
    <p>Krem­lin critic Alexei Navalny has been re­moved from a med­i­cally in­duced coma and is re­spond­ing to speech, Ber­lin’s Charite hos­pi­tal said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The hos­pi­tal, which has been treat­ing Mr Navalny since he was air­lifted to Ger­many af­ter fall­ing ill on a Rus­sian do­mes­tic flight last month, said his con­di­tion has im­proved and he is be­ing weaned off me­chan­i­cal ven­ti­la­tion.</p>
    <p>“It re­mains too early to gauge the po­ten­tial long-term ef­fects of his se­vere poisoning,” Charite said in a state­ment.</p>
    <p>Mr Navalny, a prom­i­nent critic of Pres­i­dent Vladimir Putin, was air­lifted to Ger­many last month af­ter col­laps­ing on a flight from the Siberian city of Tomsk to Moscow.</p>
    <p>It made an emer­gency land­ing in Omsk so that Mr Navalny could be stretchere­d off.</p>
    <p>Ger­man Chan­cel­lor An­gela Merkel has said her gov­ern­ment has con­cluded Mr Navalny, 44, was poi­soned with Novi­chok, the same sub­stance Bri­tain said was used on a Rus­sian dou­ble agent and his daugh­ter in an at­tack in 2018.</p>
    <p>Moscow says it has seen no ev­i­dence Mr Navalny was poi­soned. It has de­nounced at­tempts to blame the poisoning on Rus­sia as “ab­surd”.</p>
    <p>The in­ci­dent has put the fu­ture of</p>
    <p>Ger­many’s Nord Stream 2 pipe­line with Rus­sia in doubt as a grow­ing num­ber of politi­cians call for sup­port for the project to be with­drawn un­less Rus­sia helps to clear up the cir­cum­stances around Mr Navalny’s poisoning.</p>
    <p>Dr Merkel’s spokesman said yes­ter­day she does not rule out im­pos­ing sanc­tions on the pipe­line in re­sponse to the poisoning.</p>
    <p>Novi­chok is a deadly group of nerve agents de­vel­oped by the Soviet mil­i­tary in the 1970s and 1980s. It can be de­ployed in an ul­tra-fine pow­der, liq­uid or vapour.</p>
    <p>Bri­tain says Rus­sia used Novi­chok to poi­son for­mer spy Sergei Skri­pal and his daugh­ter Yu­lia in the city of Sal­is­bury two years ago.</p>
    <p>Rus­sia has re­peat­edly de­nied any in­volve­ment in the at­tack, which the Skri­pals sur­vived. A mem­ber of the pub­lic was killed.</p>
