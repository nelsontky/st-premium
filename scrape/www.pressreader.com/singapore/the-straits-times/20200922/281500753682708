    <p>LONDON • Eng­land is on track for nearly 50,000 coro­n­avirus cases a day by the mid­dle of next month and a surg­ing death toll un­less the pub­lic gets se­ri­ous about pre­ven­tive action, top gov­ern­ment ad­vis­ers said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Rates of in­fec­tion in Eng­land are repli­cat­ing the strong resur­gence of Covid-19 seen in France and Spain, roughly dou­bling ev­ery seven days, gov­ern­ment chief med­i­cal of­fi­cer Chris Whitty told a me­dia brief­ing.</p>
    <p>“We are see­ing a rate of in­crease across the great ma­jor­ity of the coun­try,” he said, urg­ing the pub­lic to re­spect stricter guide­lines on so­cial dis­tanc­ing.</p>
    <p>The brief­ing pre­viewed an expected an­nounce­ment by Prime Min­is­ter Boris John­son this week de­tail­ing gov­ern­ment action to flat­ten the ex­po­nen­tial coro­n­avirus curve head­ing into win­ter, when reg­u­lar re­s­pi­ra­tory dis­eases typ­i­cally spike.</p>
    <p>Chief sci­en­tific ad­viser Pa­trick Val­lance, at the same brief­ing, said that based on cur­rent trends, the daily count of cases will reach about 50,000 on Oct 13, and a month later ex­ceed 200 deaths ev­ery day.</p>
    <p>Across much of Europe, virus in­fec­tions are also grow­ing along with re­stric­tions.</p>
    <p>France on Sun­day re­ported 10,569 new cases and the au­thor­i­ties are pre­par­ing tighter re­stric­tions in sev­eral cities. Health Min­is­ter Olivier Veran said Lyon and Nice would be un­der new rules by Satur­day, af­ter curbs on pub­lic gath­er­ings were im­posed in Bordeaux and Mar­seille.</p>
    <p>In Spain, the re­gional chief of Madrid yes­ter­day re­quested help from the army. Lo­cal au­thor­i­ties have or­dered a par­tial lock­down of some poorer ar­eas of Madrid, prompt­ing protests dur­ing the week­end.</p>
    <p>In Ger­many, in­fec­tion rates have also been ris­ing, reach­ing lev­els not seen since April, but still lower than that of its south­ern neigh­bours. How­ever, i n the Nether­lands, the num­ber of daily new cases topped 2,000 for the first time yes­ter­day, data from the health au­thor­i­ties showed.</p>
    <p>LONDON • Britain will face an ex­po­nen­tially grow­ing death rate from Covid-19 within weeks un­less ur­gent action is taken to halt a rapidly spread­ing sec­ond wave of the out­break, the coun­try’s se­nior medics said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>It al­ready has the high­est of­fi­cial Covid-19 death toll in Europe – and the fifth-largest in the world – while it is also bor­row­ing record amounts in an at­tempt to pump emer­gency money through the dam­aged econ­omy.</p>
    <p>But new cases are ris­ing by at least 6,000 per day in Britain, ac­cord­ing to week-old data, hospi­tal ad­mis­sions are dou­bling ev­ery eight days, and the test­ing sys­tem is buck­ling.</p>
    <p>Pro­fes­sor Chris Whitty, the gov­ern­ment’s chief med­i­cal of­fi­cer, and Dr Pa­trick Val­lance, its chief sci­en­tific ad­viser, cau­tioned that if left un­re­stricted, the epi­demic would reach 50,000 new cases per day by the mid­dle of next month in the United King­dom.</p>
    <p>“If this con­tin­ued along t he path... the num­ber of deaths di­rectly from Covid... will con­tinue to rise, po­ten­tially on an ex­po­nen­tial curve, that means dou­bling and dou­bling and dou­bling again, and you can quickly move from re­ally quite small num­bers to re­ally very large num­bers,” Prof Whitty said.</p>
    <p>“If we don’t do enough, the virus will take off and at the mo­ment, that is the path that we are clearly on and if we do not change course, then we’re go­ing to find our­selves in a very dif­fi­cult prob­lem.”</p>
    <p>The virus is spread­ing across all ar­eas of the coun­try and less than 8 per cent of the pop­u­la­tion have an­ti­bod­ies to the virus, though in London, around 17 per cent of the pop­u­la­tion may have an­ti­bod­ies, Dr Val­lance said.</p>
    <p>Speed and action are ur­gently needed, both med­i­cal ex­perts said, adding that as win­ter was ap­proach­ing, the Covid-19 prob­lem would haunt Britain for an­other six months at least.</p>
    <p>Prime Min­is­ter Boris John­son is expected to make a state­ment in the Lower House of Par­lia­ment to­day, the leader of the House of Com­mons said.</p>
    <p>Mr John­son will also chair an emer­gency re­sponse meet­ing – a so-called Cobra meet­ing – to­day to dis­cuss what steps might be needed next to tackle a resur­gence in the pan­demic, his spokesman said.</p>
    <p>The Bri­tish PM was due to talk to the lead­ers of North­ern Ire­land, Scot­land and Wales yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Health Sec­re­tary Matt Han­cock said the re­stric­tions would be dif­fer­ent from the last time. The gov­ern­ment wants to crack down on so­cial­is­ing, but schools and many work­places will stay open.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, semi-au­ton­o­mous gov­ern­ments in Scot­land, Wales and North­ern Ire­land have di­rected much of their re­sponse to the pan­demic in those ar­eas.</p>
    <p>Wales has slapped curbs on four more ar­eas – Blae­nau Gwent, Brid­gend, Merthyr Tyd­fil and New­port – leav­ing just un­der a third of the pop­u­la­tion un­der re­stric­tion.</p>
    <p>The re­stric­tions pre­vent peo­ple from en­ter­ing these ar­eas with­out a rea­son­able ex­cuse such as ed­u­ca­tion or work. Res­i­dents are also al­lowed to only meet out­doors peo­ple they do not live with.</p>
    <p>Scot­tish First Min­is­ter Nicola Stur­geon said more re­stric­tions were al­most cer­tain to be im­posed. “I need to be ab­so­lutely straight with peo­ple. Across Scot­land, ad­di­tional re­stric­tions will al­most cer­tainly be put in place... over the next cou­ple of days,” she said.</p>
    <p>Britain’s of­fi­cial death toll stands at 41,777 peo­ple.</p>
