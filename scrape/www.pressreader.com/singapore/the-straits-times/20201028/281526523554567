    <p>The dig­i­tal econ­omy will fea­ture promi­nently in Sin­ga­pore’s next five-year Re­search, In­no­va­tion and En­ter­prise plan, with more fund­ing set aside to de­velop this area, said Deputy Prime Min­is­ter Heng Swee Keat yes­ter­day at the two-day For­tune Global Fo­rum.</p>
    <p>The dig­i­tal econ­omy will fea­ture promi­nently in Sin­ga­pore’s next five-year Re­search, In­no­va­tion and En­ter­prise (RIE) plan, with more fund­ing set aside to de­velop this area, said Deputy Prime Min­is­ter Heng Swee Keat yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>This will in­volve part­ner­ing com­pa­nies to build up the coun­try’s tech tal­ent pool as well as a re­newed fo­cus on cy­ber se­cu­rity as more trans­ac­tions go on­line.</p>
    <p>Speak­ing at the two-day For­tune Global Fo­rum, Mr Heng noted that a sig­nif­i­cant por­tion of the $20 bil­lion RIE2020 plan, which mapped out Sin­ga­pore’s re­search and de­vel­op­ment strat­egy from 2016 to 2020, was spent on dig­i­tal­i­sa­tion. But un­der RIE2025, which is be­ing fi­nalised, even more money will go to­wards de­vel­op­ing the dig­i­tal econ­omy, he said. “We do be­lieve that this is go­ing to be crit­i­cal for the fu­ture.”</p>
    <p>Mr Heng was tak­ing part in a di­a­logue on dig­i­tal economies with Mr An­thony Tan, chief ex­ec­u­tive of ride-hail­ing firm Grab. They dis­cussed such top­ics as the chal­lenges of dig­i­tal trans­for­ma­tion and the po­ten­tial for Sin­ga­pore to con­nect with the wider world.</p>
    <p>Mr Tan an­nounced at the event that Grab will part­ner Mi­crosoft in a se­ries of train­ing and de­vel­op­ment pro­grammes for stu­dents as well as Grab’s driv­ers and de­liv­ery rid­ers. The aim is to help them grow their dig­i­tal skill sets and im­prove their em­ploy­ment op­por­tu­ni­ties. It aims to reach out to a max­i­mum of 5,000 driv­ers and de­liv­ery rid­ers, and 250 ter­tiary stu­dents by the end of next year.</p>
    <p>Speak­ing about the chal­lenges of help­ing small busi­nesses go dig­i­tal, Mr Tan said Grab’s ex­pe­ri­ence work­ing with farm­ers and wet mar­ket sell­ers in the re­gion has shown it that things are not as sim­ple as “giv­ing them a phone... and let magic hap­pen”.</p>
    <p>His com­pany has pro­vided such small busi­ness own­ers with the tools to au­to­mat­i­cally cor­rect pho­tos of items for sale, and mi­cro-loans that are typ­i­cally not pro­vided by tra­di­tional in­sti­tu­tions.</p>
    <p>“We need to cre­ate tools to help th­ese small busi­nesses at­tract cus­tomers, like real-time data in­sights,” he said. “We have to pro­vide train­ing (for) new skills – the old walk-in cus­tomer is go­ing to be very dif­fer­ent from our Web on­line browser.”</p>
    <p>On a larger scale, the dig­i­tal revo­lu­tion also means coun­tries have the op­por­tu­nity to con­nect with one another more than ever be­fore, Mr Heng said. He gave the ex­am­ple of dig­i­tal econ­omy agree­ments, which Sin­ga­pore has inked with coun­tries such as New Zealand, Chile and Aus­tralia, and also spoke on im­prov­ing cross-bor­der data flows for fi­nan­cial ser­vices.</p>
    <p>“The data that drives a lot of trans­ac­tions, in­clud­ing the data on dig­i­tal fi­nance, on the flow of cap­i­tal, is go­ing to be crit­i­cal,” he said. “Dur­ing a global fi­nan­cial cri­sis, trade came to a halt be­cause no one could trust any­one else... If we can do bet­ter cross-bor­der data flow of fi­nan­cial ser­vices, you can al­low for bet­ter risk and busi­ness de­ci­sions, and that would al­low for trade to con­tinue to flow.”</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore is also up­grad­ing its trade plat­forms and work­ing with other coun­tries on how dig­i­tal tech­nol­ogy can help bet­ter man­age cities, Mr Heng said. “The more we can con­nect glob­ally and, at the same time, trans­form lo­cally, the more suc­cess­ful we can be, the more we can play a role in the global econ­omy.”</p>
    <p>PRO­VID­ING TOOLS AND TRAIN­ING</p>
    <p>We need to cre­ate tools to help th­ese small busi­nesses at­tract cus­tomers, like real-time data in­sights. We have to pro­vide train­ing (for) new skills – the old walk-in cus­tomer is go­ing to be very dif­fer­ent from our Web on­line browser.</p>
