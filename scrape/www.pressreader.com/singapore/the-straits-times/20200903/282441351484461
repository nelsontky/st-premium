    <p>NEW YORK • Or­gan­is­ers made the most out of the lack of spec­ta­tors to build a sprawl­ing out­door lounge at Flush­ing Mead­ows this year, af­ford­ing US Open com­peti­tors an un­prece­dented range of out­door recre­ation on an oth­er­wise empty plaza in­side Bil­lie Jean King Na­tional Ten­nis Cen­tre.</p>
    <p>Fist-bumps and hug­ging are out at the hard-court Grand Slam – as many signs across the cam­pus are quick to re­mind that this is a “bub­ble” from the Covid-19 pan­demic.</p>
    <p>So­cially dis­tanced recre­ation is in, with a life-size chess board, minia­ture golf and pop­u­lar lawn games like a bean­bag toss placed in front of Arthur Ashe Sta­dium, which would nor­mally see thou­sands of fans milling about.</p>
    <p>Foos­ball, a bas­ket­ball hoop, “soc­cer bil­liards” and shuf­fle-puck are also avail­able for play­ers to en­joy, in pub­lic spa­ces where ticket-hold­ers once roamed, as tour­na­ment or­gan­is­ers aim to keep play­ers away from the locker room and send them out into fresh air.</p>
    <p>While in­door ac­tiv­i­ties like ta­ble ten­nis have long been avail­able to play­ers on their off hours, tour­na­ment or­gan­is­ers said this year was the first time an out­door dis­play of this scale has ever been in­stalled.</p>
    <p>With­out fans on site, “it’s def­i­nitely a change, but it’s kind of peace­ful, you know,” Cana­dian De­nis Shapo­valov told re­porters af­ter his first-round 6-4, 4-6, 6-3, 6-2 vic­tory over Amer­i­can Se­bas­tian Korda on Mon­day. “We have so much space on the grounds.”</p>
    <p>Set-up be­gan on the south plaza on Aug 3 and took two weeks, with play­ers at last week’s West­ern & South­ern Open get­ting a first crack at the new toys.</p>
    <p>At the newly-dubbed “Ashe Beach”, play­ers can re­lax in Adiron­dack-style lounge chairs in front of the large tele­vi­sion screens in front of cen­tre court, where the soothing sounds of the wa­ter foun­tains pro­vide an air of tran­quil­lity.</p>
    <p>Those look­ing for more pri­vacy can opt in­stead for a seat at one of the avail­able ca­banas, in a scene that one could nearly mis­take for a re­sort lounge, were it not for signs re­mind­ing peo­ple to wash their hands and stop hug­ging each other.</p>
    <p>“They got a lit­tle ar­cade for us at the ho­tel and some bas­ket­ball and ac­tiv­i­ties here,” 16-year-old Amer­i­can Ka­t­rina Scott told re­porters af­ter her first-round 7-6 (7-3), 6-2 win against Rus­sia’s Na­talia Vikhlyant­seva.</p>
    <p>She called the ameni­ties “a nice ad­di­tion” to the cam­pus, “es­pe­cially since we’re in the bub­ble and we can’t do much”.</p>
    <p>On the court, or­gan­is­ers have also turned to LED screens show­ing fans vir­tu­ally, al­though not ev­ery­one is a fan of the at­mos­phere.</p>
    <p>Two-time Ma­jor cham­pion Victoria Azarenka, who won the West­ern & South­ern Open ti­tle, still finds the ex­pe­ri­ence “re­ally weird” de­spite this be­ing her third WTA tour­na­ment since the Tour restarted last month.</p>
    <p>“In the big mo­ments, the crowd cheer­ing, be­ing part of our world – that’s what hon­estly I prac­tise for – to play in front of the crowd, in front of the fans,” the Be­laru­sian said.</p>
