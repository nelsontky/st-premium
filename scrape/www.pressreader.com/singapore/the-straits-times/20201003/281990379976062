    <p>A confession: I’ve been feel­ing rather down of late. I am well aware that I’m not the only one.</p>
    <p>It is 2020, af­ter all.</p>
    <p>This is a year that is fi­nally de­liv­er­ing on the dystopian prom­ises of late-20th-cen­tury sci­ence fic­tion. And I should be clear that by “rather down” I mean ex­actly that. I am ba­si­cally fine, and at a time when most peo­ple have it worse, I can – and do – count my bless­ings. I note all this not to beg for your sym­pa­thy, although I have found FT read­ers to be very sym­pa­thetic peo­ple. It is con­text for what fol­lows.</p>
    <p>A few days ago, up popped a re­minder that I had writ­ten my­self back in Jan­uary: “Blanch­flower: Mis­ery peaks at age 47.2.”</p>
    <p>For years, econ­o­mist David Blanch­flower has been in­ves­ti­gat­ing the de­ter­mi­nants of “sub­jec­tive well-be­ing” – by which so­cial sci­en­tists mean things such as anx­i­ety, pain and sat­is­fac­tion with life.</p>
    <p>Along with his aca­demic col­leagues such as Carol Graham and An­drew Oswald, Blanch­flower has fo­cused on the way that well-be­ing seems to change over the course of each per­son’s life.</p>
    <p>And with some of this work catch­ing the head­lines in Jan­uary, I made a note to cir­cle back to the topic.</p>
    <p>Reader, I just turned 47. Peak mis­ery awaits me at the end of Novem­ber, when I will turn 47.2. And the idea doesn’t seem nearly as funny to me now as it did dur­ing the happy, heady days of Jan­uary.</p>
    <p>The idea that hap­pi­ness varies sys­tem­at­i­cally over the course of our lives, with highs for the young and the old, and lows for those of us in mid­dle age, is con­tro­ver­sial.</p>
    <p>Part of the prob­lem is that, as econ­o­mist and hap­pi­ness scholar Justin Wolfers puts it: “Peo­ple tend to be in­cred­i­bly un­clear what they’re try­ing to mea­sure, or why.”</p>
    <p>Should we, for ex­am­ple, try to mea­sure “raw” well-be­ing or ad­just for other vari­ables?</p>
    <p>Peo­ple with jobs, in­come, spouses and good health tend to be hap­pier than peo­ple with­out, other things be­ing equal – and peo­ple of my age are rea­son­ably likely to have all of those things.</p>
    <p>So it is one thing to say that peo­ple are mis­er­able in their late 40s. It is quite dif­fer­ent to say, though, that all things con­sid­ered they are more mis­er­able than one might ex­pect. The ev­i­dence for the lat­ter state­ment is a lot stronger.</p>
    <p>There is also the ques­tion of whether the data is show­ing us a prob­lem that af­flicts any group of peo­ple as they hit mid­dle age, or some­thing more spe­cific to Gen­er­a­tion X (born 1965-1980).</p>
    <p>A new study by Nobel lau­re­ate An­gus Deaton and re­searchers</p>
    <p>Anne Case and Arthur Stone finds that “in Amer­ica to­day, the el­derly re­port less pain than those in mid-life”. Fifty-some­things are most likely to re­port liv­ing in pain. But Case and her col­leagues con­clude that the 50-some­things have been caught in the cross­fire of two off­set­ting ef­fects.</p>
    <p>Peo­ple are more likely to suf­fer from painful ill health as they age, yet pain has wors­ened for each suc­ces­sive Amer­i­can gen­er­a­tion. Those born in 1970 are more likely to suf­fer from pain at the age of (say) 40 than those born in 1960, who in turn suf­fer more than those born in 1950.</p>
    <p>What Case, Deaton and Stone are find­ing is not a mid-life prob­lem but a swelling wave of suf­fer­ing rolling through the gen­er­a­tions.</p>
    <p>Blanch­flower, Graham and Oswald are con­fi­dent that their find­ings stack up, though: mid-life mis­ery, they be­lieve, is a ro­bust re­al­ity.</p>
    <p>What is more, it’s a sub­stan­tial ef­fect, “com­pa­ra­ble to ma­jor life events like los­ing a spouse, los­ing a job or get­ting can­cer”, write Blanch­flower and Graham. Per­haps.</p>
    <p>If so, then what? Un­hap­pi­ness mat­ters, to be sure.</p>
    <p>Case and Deaton have shown that it is killing peo­ple in the US through sui­cide, al­co­holism and drug over­doses. And you don’t have to be a Ben­thamite util­i­tar­ian to recog­nise that pain, anx­i­ety and de­pres­sion are im­por­tant prob­lems in their own right.</p>
    <p>Mis­ery has other ram­i­fi­ca­tions, too.</p>
    <p>A new study – (Un)Hap­pi­ness and vot­ing in US pres­i­den­tial elec­tions – finds that the best pre­dic­tor of vot­ing for Mr Don­ald Trump in 2016 was be­ing un­happy or dis­sat­is­fied with your lot. That makes sense: if es­tab­lish­ment politi­cians have failed to pro­tect you from mis­ery, it seems less crazy to roll the dice on a re­al­ity TV star, at least while he is the chal­lenger rather than an in­cum­bent.</p>
    <p>But ex­actly how we should re­spond to this phe­nom­e­non is un­clear.</p>
