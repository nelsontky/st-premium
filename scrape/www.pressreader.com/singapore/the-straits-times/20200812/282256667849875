    <p>Ms Chee Shiao Ti­ing will be look­ing to up­grade her iPhone X when Ap­ple’s new flag­ship model comes out later this year.</p>
    <p>“In these times, the smart­phone is the most im­por­tant gad­get to have as I need it to stay con­nected with both my friends and clients,” says the 26-year-old mar­ket­ing ex­ec­u­tive.</p>
    <p>Be­sides, she adds, up­grad­ing to a flag­ship smart­phone that lasts longer will make more sense in the long run.</p>
    <p>The season for flag­ship smart­phones has started. And con­sumers like Ms Chee, who are plan­ning to get top-tier mod­els, could help stem de­clin­ing sales of smart­phones amid the eco­nomic un­cer­tainty brought about by the Covid-19 pan­demic, ac­cord­ing to an­a­lysts The Straits Times spoke to re­cently.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to mar­ket re­search firm Coun­ter­point Re­search, the global smart­phone mar­ket de­clined at its fastest rate ever in the sec­ond quar­ter of the year, with 271.4 mil­lion units shipped, a 24 per cent drop com­pared with the same pe­riod last year.</p>
    <p>Mr Varun Mishra, re­search an­a­lyst at Coun­ter­point Re­search, says flag­ship smart­phones have al­ways been a big driver of profit stream for the in­dus­try. “We think the flag­ship seg­ment will be least af­fected among all (seg­ments) dur­ing the p a n d e mi c . The con­sumer seg­ment, which caters to the flag­ship de­mand, also comes from an eco­nom­i­cally stronger back­ground,” he says.</p>
    <p>He notes that for emerg­ing mar­kets like In­dia, the pre­mium seg­ment was one of the l east af­fected and even reached its high­est mar­ket share in the sec­ond quar­ter of the year.</p>
    <p>The end of the year usu­ally marks the re­lease of flag­ship smart­phones from ma­jor ven­dors.</p>
    <p>Sam­sung fired the first salvo last week, when it launched its lat­est flag­ship Note20 se­ries smart­phones and new pre­mium fold­able smart­phone Galaxy Z Fold2.</p>
    <p>Ap­ple and Huawei have un­veiled their flag­ship smart­phones in Septem­ber in pre­vi­ous years. Both are ex­pected to do so again this year even though de­lays are ex­pected in terms of avail­abil­ity.</p>
    <p>Google an­nounced its flag­ship Pixel 5 smart­phone when it launched its mid-range Pixel 4a two weeks ago. There are ru­mours that Pixel 5 will be launched in Oc­to­ber.</p>
    <p>Flag­ship smart­phones and the hol­i­day buy­ing season have tra­di­tion­ally bol­stered smart­phone sales in the last quar­ter of the year. Smart­phone mak­ers shipped 368.8 mil­lion smart­phones dur­ing the last quar­ter of last year – a 2.9 per cent in­crease from the pre­vi­ous quar­ter, ac­cord­ing to re­search firm IDC.</p>
    <p>Mr Loo Wee Teck, global head of con­sumer elec­tron­ics at mar­ket re­search provider Euromon­i­tor In­ter­na­tional, ex­pects flag­ship mod­els to help ven­dors close out the year on a more pos­i­tive note.</p>
    <p>“(Flag­ship smart­phones) draw all the eye­balls and gen­er­ate pos­i­tive re­views, al­low­ing a com­pany’s en­try and mid-range mod­els to ride on the coat­tails of these highly rated flag­ship mod­els,” he says.</p>
    <p>Tak­ing Sam­sung as an ex­am­ple, Mr Loo says: “While its sales are eroded in the en­try and mid-range seg­ments, Sam­sung is bank­ing on stronger sales for its flag­ship Note se­ries (as well as its much higher mar­gins) to off­set the de­cline for the lower-priced mod­els and push up its rev­enues.”</p>
    <p>He adds that the ac­tual pric­ing of flag­ship mod­els is hid­den by the mo­bile plans of­fered by tel­cos.</p>
    <p>“Prices of these phones are masked by mo­bile plans and sub­scribers can snag these flag­ship mod­els for a price that can be lower than an en­try model (with­out mo­bile con­tract),” he says.</p>
    <p>For in­stance, the $1,898 Sam­sung Galaxy Note20 Ul­tra flag­ship smart­phone can cost as low as $338 with a two-year $100-a-month con­tract here.</p>
    <p>Bank­ing ex­ec­u­tive Jerry Gong, 35, is think­ing of up­grad­ing to the Sam­sung Galaxy Note20 from his cur­rent Huawei smart­phone, once his telco con­tract ex­pires in Oc­to­ber.</p>
    <p>He says: “Since I am al­ready pay­ing the telco ev­ery month for my mo­bile line, I might as well take the con­tract to sub­sidise the phone.”</p>
