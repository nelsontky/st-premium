    <p>The woman who is su­ing PUB for $5 mil­lion af­ter she fell into a man­hole was con­fronted in court yes­ter­day with her ac­tive Carousell ac­count, which has 194 re­views.</p>
    <p>Her ac­count on the shop­ping plat­form listed di­verse items, in­clud­ing es­sen­tial oils, a pink bikini and even a Pung­gol flat for rent.</p>
    <p>Lawyers for PUB’s in­sur­ers said Madam Chan Hui Peng, 47, had met up with buy­ers who left her pos­i­tive re­views, de­spite her claims that the ac­ci­dent caused her to be­come wary of strangers.</p>
    <p>Madam Chan, who fell into a 1.8m-deep man­hole in Si­mon Road near Ko­van, on Dec 1, 2015, claims the ac­ci­dent caused her to suf­fer from post-trau­matic stress dis­or­der and schizophre­nia, in ad­di­tion to a frac­tured an­kle.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, the third day of trial, Ms Grace Tan, one of PUB’s lawyers from WhiteFern, said the Carousell ac­count was started in April 2017, around the time Madam Chan started see­ing a psy­chi­a­trist. Ms Tan said: “You have no is­sues meet­ing with strangers to sell things, but you are telling your psy­chol­o­gist and your psy­chi­a­trist that you are wary about meet­ing new peo­ple.”</p>
    <p>Madam Chan replied: “My psy­chi­a­trists and psy­chol­o­gists all en­cour­age me to have a nor­mal life, to go and meet peo­ple, be friendly, punc­tual and pleas­ant.”</p>
    <p>Mr K. An­parasan, lead coun­sel for the de­fen­dant, then con­fronted Madam Chan over her “lies”.</p>
    <p>In her law­suit, Madam Chan claims that at the time of the ac­ci­dent, she was draw­ing a salary of $11,500 for a busi­ness de­vel­op­ment job that she held for a month.</p>
    <p>The de­fen­dant dis­putes this be­cause Madam Chan is us­ing the salary as a ba­sis to claim loss of earn­ings of more than $1 mil­lion.</p>
    <p>The de­fen­dant con­tends that this was not a gen­uine job as the firm was con­trolled by Madam Chan; her mother-in-law is a for­mer di­rec­tor while her hus­band is a proxy for the share­holder.</p>
    <p>On Tues­day, Madam Chan said she did not know who the cur­rent share­holder Tan Yew Tiak was.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, she ad­mit­ted that he was her ma­ter­nal un­cle.</p>
    <p>Mr An­parasan said: “An­swer my ques­tion, will your lies stop to­day?” Madam Chan replied: “I’m not ly­ing but, sure.”</p>
    <p>Mr An­parasan said he was giv­ing her a chance to dis­cuss with her lawyers on whether she wanted to with­draw her “dis­hon­est” claim be­cause there was “damn­ing” ev­i­dence against her.</p>
    <p>Madam Chan ac­cused him of mak­ing things dif­fi­cult for her over “one month of salary”.</p>
    <p>She said her pay at her last job was $11,500 and she had a job of­fer for $12,000 in April 2016. “My mar­ket rate is there,” she said.</p>
    <p>Pressed on whether she would be dis­cussing with her lawyers, she said: “I will take their ad­vice.”</p>
    <p>The trial con­tin­ues to­day.</p>
