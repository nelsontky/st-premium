    <p>The beg­ging started a few weeks ago.</p>
    <p>“Can we have a dog?” asks the 11-year-old in our house. “Do you love me? Can we have a cat?”</p>
    <p>The an­swer is al­ways no, but the Emo­tion­ally Ma­nip­u­la­tive Force is strong in this one.</p>
    <p>Lu­cien stays up all night watch­ing cute cat videos on YouTube, then bats his eye­lashes at me. “Please, please, please,” he whee­dles win­somely. “Why not?” “I’m al­ler­gic to cats,” I say flatly. Of all the weird stuff I have told my kids, this one ranks rather high. I am, for ex­am­ple, def­i­nitely al­ler­gic to long-haired guinea pigs. An ex-boyfriend in­sisted on keep­ing two in his bed­room; when my se­vere asthma at­tacks each time I stayed over did not per­suade him to move them out im­me­di­ately, I should have known that he liked them bet­ter than he did me.</p>
    <p>But short-haired cats I have tol­er­ated fairly well. I had a cat for a brief pe­riod in my early 20s, and don’t mind car­ing for stray kit­tens for a few days.</p>
    <p>Still, I am highly aware that I am not cut out to be re­spon­si­ble for an­other liv­ing thing. I sleep er­ratic hours and like to travel at the drop of a hat (al­though the pan­demic has put paid to that). I am al­ways aban­don­ing hob­bies and projects for newer, shinier pur­suits. I am ex­tremely ter­ri­to­rial about my bed. In fact, I of­ten won­der if I’m ca­pa­ble of keep­ing two hu­man chil­dren alive without my hus­band, their su­perbly hands-on dad.</p>
    <p>Said hus­band has not been help­ing in my ef­forts to talk the kid out of a cat. I sus­pect he is go­ing through early-on­set Empty Nest Syn­drome. Dur­ing the school hol­i­days, when the kids went to va­ca­tion at the grand­par­ents’, he moped around the house, hug­ging our sons’ aban­doned soft toys and for­ward­ing me cat videos on In­sta­gram. Oc­ca­sion­ally, he moots get­ting a cat so he will have an­other baby to look af­ter.</p>
    <p>The an­swer is al­ways no, but the Rest­less Old Un­cle Vibe in this one is strong.</p>
    <p>With two men­folk yearn­ing for a pet, I am guilt-tripped into do­ing an in­ter­nal au­dit of our fam­ily’s ca­pac­ity to take on a new mem­ber.</p>
    <p>“Who’s go­ing to take care of the cat?” I ask.</p>
    <p>“Me, me,” says Lu­cien, rais­ing his hand.</p>
    <p>“Who will clean up af­ter it?”</p>
    <p>“Me, lor,” pipes up Rest­less Old Un­cle mo­rosely. I be­lieve him – he does all the house­work.</p>
    <p>“What if it gets into my room and shreds my books? Scratches my pi­ano?”</p>
    <p>Brisk con­sul­ta­tion be­tween father and son. “We’ll in­stall a child-proof gate and re­strict it down­stairs”, was their pro­posed so­lu­tion.</p>
    <p>“But our liv­ing room is only that big. The poor cat will have very lit­tle space to roam,” I re­but.</p>
    <p>Lu­cien vis­ually as­sesses our avail­able space and in­sists it is ad­e­quate for a frisky fe­line. I ex­press my scep­ti­cism. End of con­ver­sa­tion.</p>
    <p>The el­der son, now 14, used to ask for a Space Pig – a fan­tas­tic fly­ing an­i­mal I made up for bed­time sto­ries. It was tough telling him that I’d fibbed about that one. Pe­ri­od­i­cally, he would ask if we could get a dog – a re­quest that went away af­ter en­coun­ter­ing my Wall of No. My stock re­sponse was I al­ready had two pets – him and his brother.</p>
    <p>I feel slightly bad that I am the party pooper when it comes to fam­ily pets. Car­ing for an an­i­mal, some may tell you, helps chil­dren learn re­spon­si­bil­ity, kind­ness and self­less­ness. But it also seems self­ish to get a pet just to in­stil val­ues in one’s off­spring. A liv­ing thing is not an ed­u­ca­tional tool.</p>
    <p>Per­haps the more rel­e­vant lesson I’m teach­ing the kids here is that, in life, you can’t al­ways get what you want.</p>
    <p>An­i­mal wel­fare or­gan­i­sa­tions have in the past raised aware­ness of the huge num­ber of pets aban­doned af­ter Christ­mas – as buy­ers and re­cip­i­ents re­alise that pet own­er­ship is tougher than they bar­gained for.</p>
    <p>This year, ac­cord­ing to a Dec 26, 2020 re­port in The Daily Post in Bri­tain, an­i­mal shel­ters in Wales are brac­ing them­selves for a surge in aban­doned pets bought dur­ing lock­down by peo­ple who have not thought through whether they can care for them and af­ford their up­keep be­yond the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Call it fear of com­mit­ment. But, re­ally, for some­one who has spent her child­hood try­ing but not en­tirely suc­ceed­ing at rear­ing ham­sters, gold­fish and tur­tles, ac­knowl­edg­ing that she is not Pet</p>
    <p>Par­ent Ma­te­rial is the de­cent thing to do.</p>
    <p>Like a zom­bie that will not die, how­ever, the Cat Ques­tion keeps com­ing back.</p>
    <p>Fi­nally, af­ter count­less cir­cu­lar ar­gu­ments which al­ways end in me say­ing no, the hus­band takes us to a cat cafe on Box­ing Day.</p>
    <p>For $16 a per­son (in­clu­sive of one drink), we get to spend two hours stroking and pet­ting all 19 cats there. Lu­cien is thrilled, gin­gerly touch­ing the backs of snooz­ing tab­bies and feed­ing them kib­ble.</p>
    <p>I spend most of my time with a pe­tite orange Sin­ga­pura cat named Ginny. Soon, I am coo­ing to her like a baby – “Who’s a good kitty? Who wants to take a selfie?” – while she tol­er­ates me rub­bing her head and mess­ing up her neat fur. Darn it, I think – I am not im­mune to their charm. Cute overload, rather than al­ler­gies, was mak­ing my eyes tear up.</p>
    <p>Even­tu­ally, they throw us out at clos­ing time.</p>
    <p>“Ev­ery time you want to see cats, we’ll come here, okay?” my hus­band tells an en­rap­tured Lu­cien. The boy agrees, al­though he gives me a “don’t rub it in” look. I wisely shut my mouth.</p>
    <p>There are plenty of al­ter­na­tive ways to let one’s kids in­ter­act with do­mes­tic an­i­mals. Help­ing to walk a neigh­bour’s dog is one; cat-sit­ting for a friend is an­other. Vol­un­teer­ing with an­i­mal wel­fare or­gan­i­sa­tions is an­other op­por­tu­nity to find out if you’re re­ally up to the task of stew­ard­ship.</p>
    <p>Af­ter our cat cafe out­ing, we dis­cuss ap­ply­ing to fos­ter a cat, go­ing through the re­quired in­ter­view and house-visit process. The men­folk in our fam­ily know that this is my ef­fort to meet them half­way, even though I am still against the idea.</p>
    <p>Who knows? I am bent on not be­ing a Pet Par­ent, but once the chil­dren are grown, move out and get their own cats, I might love be­ing a Pet Grandma.</p>
