    <p>LON­DON • Manch­ester United man­ager Ole Gun­nar Sol­sk­jaer blamed the lack of clin­i­cal fin­ish­ing from his for­wards af­ter Wed­nes­day’s 3-1 Cham­pi­ons League de­feat by Paris Saint-Ger­main left their hopes of qual­i­fi­ca­tion from Group H in the bal­ance.</p>
    <p>Ney­mar struck twice, in­clud­ing one in stop­page time, at Old Traf­ford while the Red Dev­ils wasted sev­eral chances when the game was at 1-1 af­ter Mar­cus Rash­ford’s equaliser.</p>
    <p>Sol­sk­jaer’s de­ci­sion not to hook Fred off be­fore he was sent off sec­onds af­ter Mar­quin­hos scored PSG’s sec­ond was a naive mis­take which cost his side.</p>
    <p>The Brazil mid­fielder had been lucky to es­cape a red card be­fore half-time when his head­butt on Le­an­dro Pare­des was deemed to be only a yel­low card of­fence, but col­lected his sec­ond book­ing of the night for a foul on former United mid­fielder An­der Her­rera.</p>
    <p>While Sol­sk­jaer felt the dis­missal was harsh, it was their profli­gacy – in par­tic­u­lar An­thony Mar­tial blast­ing over the bar when faced with an open goal – that al­lowed PSG to nab the away win on the counter.</p>
    <p>“It was a very good game which de­served fans. With a bit more clin­i­cal fin­ish­ing, we should have fin­ished the game,” he said. “They were there for the tak­ing.</p>
    <p>“We had some big chances. The dif­fer­ence when you get to the big games is the clin­i­cal mo­ments.”</p>
    <p>On Fred’s head­butt and even­tual send­ing off, Sol­sk­jaer added: “Fred shouldn’t put his head to­wards him, it’s ei­ther noth­ing or a red card, he’s a bit lucky to stay on.</p>
    <p>“Fred has played re­ally well. We spoke about stay­ing calm and on your feet. The sec­ond yel­low card was nowhere near a foul. An­der knows that.”</p>
    <p>United, PSG and RB Leipzig are all level on nine points with just</p>
    <p>WRONG DE­CI­SION</p>
    <p>one group game re­main­ing.</p>
    <p>The French tre­ble win­ners ap­pear to have the eas­ier route to the last 16. Last season’s Cham­pi­ons League fi­nal­ists need a draw at home to Is­tan­bul Basak­se­hir to make sure of a ninth suc­ces­sive cam­paign in the knock­out phase.</p>
    <p>Hav­ing had to deal with sack ru­mours since the start of the term, PSG coach Thomas Tuchel was de­lighted to gain some mea­sure of revenge for their Cham­pi­ons League last-16 elim­i­na­tion to United last year, as well as the open­ing loss in the re­verse fix­ture in Oc­to­ber.</p>
    <p>“Win­ning at Old Traf­ford is one</p>
    <p>of the big­gest chal­lenges in the world,” said the Ger­man.</p>
    <p>“The team showed they wouldn’t ac­cept de­feat. We have taken a big step, a very hard one, but we still have to take the last step. We still need to work hard, play with the same men­tal­ity, the same fire.”</p>
    <p>Sol­sk­jaer’s side now face a tricky test at Leipzig on Tues­day.</p>
    <p>With a su­pe­rior goal dif­fer­ence and a bet­ter head-to-head record, United just need to avoid de­feat in Ger­many, but they will not play it safe at the Red Bull Arena.</p>
    <p>“The des­tiny is still in our hands. If we go to Leipzig and win, we go</p>
    <p>through. We want to be in the Cham­pi­ons League and we need to show that next week with a good per­for­mance,” Sol­sk­jaer, who also re­vealed Rash­ford was an in­jury doubt for their Premier League trip to West Ham to­mor­row, said.</p>
    <p>United cap­tain Harry Maguire added: “We’re still in con­trol of go­ing through to the knock­out stages. We had bet­ter chances.</p>
    <p>“Their two goals scored are scrappy goals. I feel that we de­served some­thing. You’ve got to take your chances and not give away soft goals.”</p>
    <p>Fred has played re­ally well. We spoke about stay­ing calm and on your feet. The sec­ond yel­low card was nowhere near a foul.</p>
