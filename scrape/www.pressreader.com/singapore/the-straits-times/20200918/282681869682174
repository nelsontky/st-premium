    <p>• Celebrity cheer­leader Jerry Har­ris, who was fea­tured in the Emmy-nom­i­nated Net­flix se­ries Cheer (2020), was sued by 14-year-old twin broth­ers in the United States, who say he so­licited sex, sent them sex­u­ally ex­plicit mes­sages via text and so­cial me­dia and asked them to send nude pho­tos of them­selves.</p>
    <p>The law­suit, filed in the District Court of Tar­rant County in Texas, ac­cuses Har­ris, who is now 21, of ask­ing one of the boys to per­form a sex­ual act at a cheer­lead­ing com­pe­ti­tion and threat­en­ing “im­mi­nent phys­i­cal bod­ily in­jury”.</p>
    <p>The boys are not named in the suit be­cause they are mi­nors.</p>
    <p>The suit ac­cuses Har­ris of “sex­ual ha­rass­ment, ex­ploita­tion abuse and mo­lesta­tion” of the boys.</p>
    <p>It states they are now “lim­ited in their abil­ity to mean­ing­fully in­ter­act with oth­ers due to the trauma of child­hood sex­ual abuse”.</p>
    <p>A spokesman for Har­ris has cat­e­gor­i­cally dis­puted the claims made against him.</p>
    <p>Har­ris, who was a mem­ber of the cheer­lead­ing t eam at Navarro Col­lege in Texas, gained ac­claim on the Net­flix se­ries for his up­beat at­ti­tude and spir­ited pep talks.</p>
    <p>He made a guest ap­pear­ance with other cast mem­bers on the Dal­las stop of talk-show host Oprah Win­frey’s well­ness tour in Fe­bru­ary and held an In­sta­gram chat with pres­i­den­tial can­di­date Joe Bi­den in June.</p>
    <p>The suit also states that three or­gan­i­sa­tions – the US All Star Fed­er­a­tion, Cheer Ath­let­ics and Var­sity Spirit – that em­ployed Har­ris or that or­gan­ised or over­saw com­pe­ti­tions he par­tic­i­pated i n as an ath­lete or coach when the be­hav­iour is al­leged to have oc­curred, did not do enough or act quickly enough to pro­tect the boys.</p>
    <p>USA To­day also re­ported that the Fed­eral Bureau of In­ves­ti­ga­tion was in­ves­ti­gat­ing al­le­ga­tions that Har­ris asked for sex and nude pho­tos from the boys. Har­ris has not been ar­rested or charged with any crime.</p>
    <p>The l aw­suit seeks more than US$1 mil­lion (S$1.36 mil­lion) in dam­ages from the US All Star Fed­er­a­tion, Cheer Ath­let­ics and Var­sity Spirit, cit­ing “emo­tional dis­tress” and “loss of en­joy­ment of life”.</p>
    <p>The law­suit states that the boys will need med­i­cal and psy­cho­log­i­cal treat­ment, ther­apy and coun­selling.</p>
