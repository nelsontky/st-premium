    <p>Mr Mo­hamed Faizal Mo­hamed Ab­dul Kadir (left), 40, re­ceived the Berita Har­ian (BH) Achiever of the Year award yes­ter­day. Mr Faizal, who is deputy chief pros­e­cu­tor at the At­tor­ney-Gen­eral’s Cham­bers, was ap­pointed se­nior coun­sel ear­lier this year. Lo­cal foot­ball leg­end Fandi Ah­mad and his daugh­ter Iman (above) ac­cepted the BH Young Achiever of the Year award on be­half of his son Ikhsan, 21, a na­tional team foot­baller who is cur­rently play­ing for Nor­we­gian First Di­vi­sion club Jerv.</p>
    <p>The Malay/Mus­lim com­mu­nity has made good so­cial progress, but for it to con­tinue to be suc­cess­ful, it needs a vi­brant next gen­er­a­tion, said Law and Home Af­fairs Min­is­ter K. Shan­mugam.</p>
    <p>He said the to­tal fer­til­ity rate of the Malay com­mu­nity has dipped even fur­ther from 1.85 in 2018 to 1.80 in 2019, which is well be­low the re­place­ment rate of 2.1.</p>
    <p>“The Malay com­mu­nity is not re­plac­ing it­self. Of course, the fig­ures are even worse for the Chi­nese and In­dian com­mu­ni­ties, but that’s not a con­so­la­tion. It’s dif­fi­cult (for our coun­try) to be suc­cess­ful if we don’t have chil­dren,” he said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>But Mr Shan­mugam, who was speak­ing at the Berita Har­ian’s Achiever of the Year award cer­e­mony, as­sured that the Gov­ern­ment will keep the pro­por­tion of Malays here sta­ble. The com­mu­nity cur­rently forms 15 per cent of the Sin­ga­pore cit­i­zen pop­u­la­tion.</p>
    <p>He said the Gov­ern­ment will con­tinue to work with the com­mu­nity to en­cour­age ex­cel­lence and achieve bet­ter out­comes for all.</p>
    <p>He held up sev­eral ini­tia­tives from the M3 col­lab­o­ra­tion be­tween three key Malay/Mus­lim or­gan­i­sa­tions: Men­daki, the Is­lamic Re­li­gious Coun­cil of Sin­ga­pore (Muis) and the Peo­ple’s As­so­ci­a­tion Malay Ac­tiv­ity Ex­ec­u­tive Com­mit­tees Coun­cil (Mesra).</p>
    <p>These in­clude the SGTeguhBer­satu (Sin­ga­pore Re­silient in Unity) task force, which brought to­gether com­mu­nity part­ners and gov­ern­ment agen­cies to im­prove sup­port mea­sures in ar­eas like em­ploy­ment and men­tal health.</p>
    <p>He also high­lighted the work by con­tin­u­ing ed­u­ca­tion and train­ing provider Men­daki Sense, which has helped more than 650 peo­ple land a job.</p>
    <p>Mr Shan­mugam sketched out three broad ar­eas where he said the Malay com­mu­nity has made progress. First, in the area of in­come, the min­is­ter noted that the me­dian monthly house­hold i ncome of Malay house­holds has risen by more than 80 per cent over 15 years, from $2,900 in 2000 to $5,340 in 2015.</p>
    <p>In terms of ed­u­ca­tion, one in two Malay stu­dents pro­gresses to pub­licly funded full-time de­gree or diploma cour­ses – an im­prove­ment from the one in four 20 years ago, he noted.</p>
    <p>The third area is in terms of home own­er­ship, as nine out of 10 Malay house­holds now own their homes, and more than 60 per cent of these peo­ple live in a four-room flat or larger, Mr Shan­mugam added.</p>
    <p>He said: “Tremen­dous progress has been made, (and there is a) bright fu­ture for the chil­dren… who can get good jobs and ex­cel. And that is also our wider Sin­ga­pore story.”</p>
    <p>Mr Shan­mugam pre­sented the Berita Har­ian Achiever of the Year award to Mr Mo­hamed Faizal Mo­hamed Ab­dul Kadir, deputy chief pros­e­cu­tor and se­nior state coun­sel at the At­tor­ney-Gen­eral’s Cham­bers. The award was given in recog­ni­tion of Mr Faizal’s con­tri­bu­tions to the le­gal sec­tor as well as to the com­mu­nity.</p>
    <p>Berita Har­ian’s Young Achiever of the Year ti­tle went to na­tional team foot­baller Ikhsan Fandi, 21, who is cur­rently play­ing for Nor­we­gian First Di­vi­sion club Jerv.</p>
    <p>Say­ing that many other ac­com­plished and ex­em­plary in­di­vid­u­als like Mr Faizal and Mr Ikhsan have be­come role models for the next gen­er­a­tion, Mr Shan­mugam urged the Malay/Mus­lims to give back and to sup­port one an­other.</p>
    <p>“We must build on our suc­cesses and con­trib­ute to a thriv­ing, in­te­grated, vi­brant Malay/Mus­lim com­mu­nity,” he said.</p>
    <p>Tremen­dous progress has been made, (and there is a) bright fu­ture for the chil­dren… who can get good jobs and ex­cel.</p>
    <p>And that is also our wider Sin­ga­pore story.</p>
