    <p>LON­DON • Bri­tish Prime Min­is­ter Boris John­son said there is “no al­ter­na­tive” to im­pos­ing a coro­n­avirus lock­down to stop the health ser­vice from be­ing over­whelmed, as he re­vealed plans for whole cities to be tested to root out asymp­to­matic car­ri­ers of the virus.</p>
    <p>Mass checks will be tri­alled in Liver­pool from Fri­day with ev­ery­one in the city to be of­fered re­peat test­ing – even if they do not have symp­toms. If the pro­gramme is suc­cess­ful, mil­lions of test kits will be dis­trib­uted in other places in the com­ing weeks, the gov­ern­ment said.</p>
    <p>“This kind of mass test­ing has the po­ten­tial to be a pow­er­ful new weapon i n our fight against Covid-19,” Mr John­son said in a state­ment.</p>
    <p>On Mon­day, the Bri­tish pre­mier told the House of Com­mons that rapid test kits could be used in schools and else­where to al­low the economy to keep mov­ing be­fore the much-an­tic­i­pated roll-out of a vac­cine next year.</p>
    <p>The push for mass test­ing comes as a resur­gence in the pan­demic threat­ens to over­whelm the coun­try’s healthcare sys­tem. Mr John­son re­sponded over the week­end by or­der­ing a four-week par­tial lock­down in Eng­land, with pubs, restau­rants and non-es­sen­tial shops to close from to­mor­row.</p>
    <p>Speak­ing in the House of Com­mons on Mon­day, Mr John­son re­jected crit­i­cism that he had been too slow to act, telling law­mak­ers he had done his “level best” to avoid na­tional re­stric­tions and that the num­ber of deaths could be twice as high as the first wave in the spring with­out ur­gent ac­tion.</p>
    <p>“Faced with these lat­est fig­ures, there is no al­ter­na­tive but to take fur­ther ac­tion at a na­tional level,” he said. If the health ser­vice is al­lowed to be over­whelmed, “doc­tors and nurses could be forced to choose which pa­tients to treat, who would live and who would die”, he told law­mak­ers.</p>
    <p>But he faced anger from some of his own Con­ser­va­tive Party col­leagues over the plan, which will be sub­ject to a vote to­day.</p>
    <p>Vet­eran MP Charles Walker warned that Britain is drift­ing “fur­ther into an au­thor­i­tar­ian co­er­cive state” un­der the mea­sures.</p>
    <p>“The peo­ple of this coun­try will never, ever for­give the po­lit­i­cal class for crim­i­nal­is­ing par­ents see­ing chil­dren and chil­dren see­ing par­ents,” he told Mr John­son.</p>
    <p>Min­is­ters have been work­ing to defuse ten­sions among Tory law­mak­ers ahead of the vote, and Mr John­son spoke with his party’s MPs over the week­end. The pre­mier sought to ad­dress some of their con­cerns on Mon­day, say­ing the mea­sures will be strictly time­lim­ited to Dec 2, when Par­lia­ment will vote on the way for­ward.</p>
    <p>The new lock­down is likely to be ap­proved in the House of Com­mons after Labour and other op­po­si­tion par­ties said they would vote for the plan. But Labour leader Keir Starmer said “the hu­man cost will be higher” be­cause Mr John­son ig­nored the ad­vice of his own sci­en­tists to im­pose a short lock­down in Septem­ber.</p>
    <p>Se­nior Tory MP Gra­ham Brady called for a “full im­pact assess­ment” of the cost of the lock­down, in­clud­ing the toll on peo­ple’s men­tal health, be­fore the vote. For­mer min­is­ter Mike Pen­ning con­firmed in a tele­phone in­ter­view he will vote against the gov­ern­ment.</p>
    <p>Mr John­son and Chan­cel­lor of the Ex­che­quer Rishi Su­nak un­veiled ad­di­tional fi­nan­cial sup­port for busi­nesses and work­ers to add to the month-long ex­ten­sion of the gov­ern­ment’s flag­ship fur­lough pro­gramme that was an­nounced last Satur­day.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing this month, the state will dou­ble sup­port for self-em­ployed work­ers to 80 per cent of their usual trad­ing prof­its, in line with fur­lough pay­ments.</p>
    <p>The Trea­sury also ex­tended the dead­line for busi­nesses to ap­ply for state-backed loans un­til the end of Jan­uary. It said those that al­ready have such loans will be able to top them up.</p>
    <p>NO AL­TER­NA­TIVE</p>
    <p>Faced with these lat­est fig­ures, there is no al­ter­na­tive but to take fur­ther ac­tion at a na­tional level... (oth­er­wise) doc­tors and nurses could be forced to choose which pa­tients to treat, who would live and who would die.</p>
