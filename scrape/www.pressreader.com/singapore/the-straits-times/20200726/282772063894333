    <p>Some Covid-19 pa­tients are re­port­ing that their re­cov­ery is tak­ing longer than ex­pected, as they ex­pe­ri­ence short­ness of breath and fa­tigue. Some have prob­lems fo­cus­ing, and headaches and dizzi­ness, while oth­ers suf­fer anx­i­ety and post-trau­matic stress dis­or­der.</p>
    <p>Still, six months since the first case here, not much is known about these pa­tients, and who is clearly at risk. “Anec­do­tally, many of my pa­tients who I see in fol­low-up tell me that they feel tired and not quite able to do as much as they used to, but that they are grad­u­ally im­prov­ing,” says Pro­fes­sor Paul Tam­byah, a se­nior con­sul­tant at the Di­vi­sion of In­fec­tious Dis­eases at the Na­tional Univer­sity Hos­pi­tal (NUH).</p>
    <p>“This is com­mon with many vi­ral in­fec­tions, such as in­fluenza and dengue, so I usu­ally re­as­sure them that this will gen­er­ally grad­u­ally re­solve over time.”</p>
    <p>He says there are large ob­ser­va­tional co­hort stud­ies be­ing con­ducted in Sin­ga­pore and else­where, but it is too early to know de­tails about who gets these “lin­ger­ing ef­fects” and for how long.</p>
    <p>Ear­lier this month, the United King­dom launched a ma­jor study that will look into the long-term health ef­fects of Covid-19 and aims to re­cruit around 10,000 pa­tients dis­charged from hos­pi­tal.</p>
    <p>“In a com­pletely un­sci­en­tific way, about one or two of the 10 pa­tients I saw (just in one day) in clinic in fol­low-ups had some mild resid­ual fa­tigue, but only with stren­u­ous ex­er­cise (like long runs),” says Prof Tam­byah. These are the peo­ple with mild ill­ness who have fa­tigue for a few weeks.</p>
    <p>Then, there is another group – a small num­ber of pa­tients who have had strokes or other neu­ro­log­i­cal com­pli­ca­tions and will need longterm re­ha­bil­i­ta­tion and take longer to re­cover, he adds.</p>
    <p>Dr Ooi Say Tat, who leads the Di­vi­sion of In­fec­tious Dis­eases un­der the De­part­ment of Gen­eral Medicine at Khoo Teck Puat Hos­pi­tal, says doc­tors are still learn­ing about syn­dromes of post-acute Covid-19 pa­tients. “Of what we know, some pa­tients de­vel­oped heart at­tack, stroke, clots in lungs, weeks af­ter ini­tial in­fec­tion.”</p>
    <p>One pa­tient, Mr Toh Kai Kiat, had a car­diac ar­rest while he was on ex­tra­cor­po­real mem­brane oxy­gena­tion (ECMO) treat­ment, used as a last re­sort to save crit­i­cally ill pa­tients. He is still slowly re­cov­er­ing three months af­ter be­ing dis­charged from NUH.</p>
    <p>Upon his dis­charge, he was given blood thin­ner med­i­ca­tion to pre­vent blood clots, and still has fol­low-up checks for his heart, kid­ney and liver. Covid-19 may not just af­fect the lungs, but also the kid­neys, liver, heart, brain and ner­vous sys­tem, skin and gas­troin­testi­nal tract.</p>
    <p>NEEDS WALK­ING STICK</p>
    <p>The 54-year-old now gets about with the aid of a walk­ing stick, as he says the ECMO treat­ment had af­fected his legs.</p>
    <p>“Ini­tially, I was walk­ing so slowly that I was slower than an el­derly per­son,” he says in Man­darin.</p>
    <p>When cross­ing a road, he could only make it to the road di­vider be­fore hav­ing to stop.</p>
    <p>“Even the el­derly gave up their seat for me at the ko­pi­tiam.</p>
    <p>“But now, my ap­petite is good and I am slowly feel­ing bet­ter.”</p>
    <p>Dr Barn­aby Young, con­sul­tant and head of the Na­tional Cen­tre for In­fec­tious Dis­eases (NCID) Re­search Clinic at the In­fec­tious Dis­ease Re­search and Train­ing Of­fice, says: “Most pa­tients will be dis­charged well and are able to go back to ex­er­cise, work and their usual life.</p>
    <p>“Some re­ported per­sis­tent mild res­pi­ra­tory symp­toms such as cough or a de­lay in re­turn of sense of smell, but this is infrequent.”</p>
    <p>Pa­tients who had very se­vere in­fec­tion and re­quired long pe­ri­ods in the in­ten­sive care unit take longer to re­cover. This some­times in­cludes a pro­longed pe­riod of re­ha­bil­i­ta­tion, and is a con­se­quence of any crit­i­cal ill­ness, says Dr Young.</p>
    <p>“Slower re­cov­ery is mainly ob­served in those who have more se­vere in­fec­tion, so older adults and in­di­vid­u­als with co­mor­bidi­ties such as di­a­betes and hy­per­ten­sion are at greater risk, since they are likely to have more se­vere in­fec­tion,” he says.</p>
    <p>Dr Young says there are also psy­cho­log­i­cal con­se­quences, which may re­flect the fear and anx­i­ety some ex­pe­ri­ence af­ter be­ing di­ag­nosed with Covid-19 and can man­i­fest in un­usual ways.</p>
    <p>These symp­toms can also be ex­ac­er­bated by pro­longed iso­la­tion, while ru­mours on so­cial me­dia and “fake news” can also cause prob­lems, he says.</p>
    <p>MAN­AG­ING THE RE­SPONSE</p>
    <p>We know now that the im­mune re­sponse to the dis­ease may be just as im­por­tant as the virus it­self in caus­ing some of the symp­toms and signs of the in­fec­tion. ’’</p>
    <p>PRO­FES­SOR PAUL TAM­BYAH, a se­nior con­sul­tant at the Di­vi­sion of In­fec­tious Dis­eases at the Na­tional Univer­sity Hos­pi­tal.</p>
    <p>NEW TREAT­MENTS</p>
    <p>Six months on, it is now also clear that man­ag­ing in­flam­ma­tory re­sponse can­not be ig­nored when treat­ing a se­verely ill pa­tient.</p>
    <p>“We know now that the im­mune re­sponse to the dis­ease may be just as im­por­tant as the virus it­self in caus­ing some of the symp­toms and signs of the in­fec­tion,” says Prof Tam­byah. “This has re­sulted in ex­plo­ration of drugs which mod­ify the im­mune sys­tem be­ing con­sid­ered for treat­ment of pa­tients with se­vere dis­ease.”</p>
    <p>One ex­am­ple is the drug dex­am­etha­sone, he says.</p>
    <p>“In NUH and in Sin­ga­pore, we are in­volved in clin­i­cal tri­als of other agents which mod­ify the body’s im­mune re­sponse to en­sure that an over ac­tive im­mune re­sponse does not cause more harm than good.”</p>
    <p>Dex­am­etha­sone was shown in a large clin­i­cal trial in the UK to ben­e­fit pa­tients with mod­er­ate to se­vere dis­ease. The cor­ti­cos­teroid, cheap and widely avail­able, has been shown to re­duce deaths among crit­i­cally ill Covid-19 pa­tients.</p>
    <p>Be­fore that, the anti-vi­ral remde­sivir had hogged head­lines as the most promis­ing drug. Stud­ies showed it can re­duce re­cov­ery time.</p>
    <p>Dr Young says: “The ma­jor dif­fer­ence in how we ap­proach pa­tients to­day is know­ing that we have two drugs: remde­sivir and dex­am­etha­sone, which have been proven in clin­i­cal tri­als to be ben­e­fi­cial.”</p>
    <p>He adds: “These drugs are only used for pa­tients who have, or are at risk of, se­vere in­fec­tion.”</p>
    <p>Dr Young says the NCID con­tin­ues to run clin­i­cal tri­als as part of global ef­forts to find bet­ter treat­ments.</p>
    <p>“Oxy­gen sup­port will be given if nec­es­sary and pa­tients may be asked to lie in dif­fer­ent po­si­tions, which helps im­prove lung func­tion,” he says.</p>
    <p>The full spec­trum of the ill­ness ranges from asymp­to­matic dis­ease to mild res­pi­ra­tory tract ill­ness to se­vere pneu­mo­nia, acute res­pi­ra­tory dis­tress syn­drome, multi-or­gan fail­ure and death.</p>
    <p>Most pa­tients here have mild in­fec­tions, and are given symp­to­matic treat­ment and kept iso­lated un­til they are non-in­fec­tious.</p>
    <p>Dr Young says: “We also now know that the virus can be de­tectable for pro­longed pe­ri­ods in the nose – usu­ally for weeks, but some­times months. How­ever, the virus is not in­fec­tious for that long and most ill­nesses will also re­cover long be­fore this.”</p>
    <p>Im­por­tantly, the lessons learnt along the way would have helped to re­duce poor out­comes.</p>
    <p>Says Prof Tam­byah: “We have also learnt a lot about the ICU care of these pa­tients and world­wide. Death rates have dropped dra­mat­i­cally, sug­gest­ing that the lessons learnt are be­ing ap­plied glob­ally.”</p>
    <p>These lessons, he says, in­clude “pron­ing pa­tients (ly­ing them prone), the use of high-flow oxy­gen, the use of dex­am­etha­sone, ap­pro­pri­ate ven­ti­la­tion strate­gies, sur­veil­lance for risk of blood clots”.</p>
