    <p>LOS AN­GE­LES • Tanya Roberts, the breathy-voiced ac­tress who found fame in the 1980s as a de­tec­tive on Char­lie’s An­gels (1976 to 1981) and as a brave earth sci­en­tist in the James Bond film A View To A Kill (1985), died on Mon­day night in Los An­ge­les. She was 65.</p>
    <p>Her death, at Cedars-Si­nai Hos­pi­tal, was con­firmed on Tues­day by her com­pan­ion Lance O’Brien.</p>
    <p>Her pub­li­cist, who was given er­ro­neous in­for­ma­tion, had an­nounced her death to the news me­dia early Mon­day, and some news or­gan­i­sa­tions pub­lished obit­u­ar­ies about her pre­ma­turely.</p>
    <p>The pub­li­cist, Mr Mike Pin­gel, said Roberts col­lapsed on Dec 24 af­ter walk­ing her dogs near her Hol­ly­wood Hills home and was put on a ven­ti­la­tor at the hos­pi­tal.</p>
    <p>He did not give the cause of death, but said it was not re­lated to Covid-19. He said she had not been no­tice­ably ill be­fore she col­lapsed.</p>
    <p>Roberts’ big act­ing break came in her mid-20s when she was cast in the fifth and last sea­son of Char­lie’s An­gels, the ABC drama se­ries that, trad­ing on its stars’ sex ap­peal, fol­lowed the ex­ploits of three at­trac­tive former po­lice of­fi­cers who of­ten fought crime wear­ing short shorts, low-cut blouses and biki­nis.</p>
    <p>The show was an im­me­di­ate hit in 1976, but its break­out star Far­rah Fawcett left af­ter one sea­son, re­placed by Ch­eryl Ladd.</p>
    <p>Kate Jack­son quit in 1979 and her re­place­ment, Shel­ley Hack, was gone af­ter just one sea­son. Roberts re­placed Hack. Ja­clyn Smith ap­peared through­out the se­ries run.</p>
    <p>There were high hopes for Roberts when she joined the cast. Her char­ac­ter, Julie, had some of Jack­son’s char­ac­ter’s street-wise at­ti­tude.</p>
    <p>Julie was known to knock a hand­gun right out of a tough crim­i­nal’s hand. Her part could not save the show’s plum­met­ing ratings, but it did lead to an ac­tive decade for her in Hol­ly­wood.</p>
    <p>Most no­tably, she was a Bond girl, play­ing a ge­ol­o­gist threat­ened by a mi­crochip-mo­nop­o­list mad­man (Christo­pher Walken) in A View To A Kill, in which late ac­tor Roger Moore made his last ap­pear­ance as Agent 007.</p>
    <p>Roberts also ap­peared in The Beast­mas­ter (1982), a fan­tasy film. And she played the ti­tle role in Sheena (1984), a highly pub­li­cised ad­ven­ture film in­spired by a queen-of-the-jun­gle comic book char­ac­ter.</p>
    <p>The film flopped at the box of­fice and Roberts be­gan fad­ing from pub­lic view.</p>
    <p>She re­turned to the spotlight in 1998 on the sit­com That ’70s Show as the glam­orous, youngish Mid­west­ern mum of a teenage girl (Laura Pre­pon).</p>
    <p>In that role, she was beau­ti­ful, slim and sexy – and de­light­fully dimwit­ted.</p>
    <p>The comic mys­tery, year af­ter year, was how her short, dumpy hus­band, played by ac­tor Don Stark with fright­en­ingly over­grown side­burns, had ever won her heart. Roberts ap­peared on the show for three sea­sons and later made guest vis­its.</p>
    <p>She was born Vic­to­ria Leigh Blum in New York City on Oct 15, 1955, the sec­ond of two daugh­ters of Os­car Max­i­m­il­ian Blum, a foun­tain pen sales­man, and Dorothy Leigh (Smith) Blum. Ac­cord­ing to some sources, Tanya was her nick­name.</p>
    <p>She spent her child­hood in the Bronx and lived briefly in Canada af­ter her par­ents’ divorce. She be­gan her ca­reer by run­ning away from home to be­come a model when she was 15.</p>
    <p>Back in New York, she stud­ied act­ing, ap­peared in some of­fBroad­way pro­duc­tions and worked as a model and a dance instructor to make ends meet.</p>
    <p>She made her screen de­but in the hor­ror thriller The Last Vic­tim (1976), about a se­rial rapist­mur­derer.</p>
    <p>Af­ter Char­lie’s An­gels, Roberts acted in both tele­vi­sion and films.</p>
    <p>Her roles in­cluded the pri­vate eye Mike Hammer’s sec­re­tary in the tele­vi­sion movie Mur­der Me,</p>
    <p>Mur­der You (1983), a de­tec­tive work­ing un­der­cover at a sex clinic in Sins Of De­sire (1993) and a talkradio host on the erotic an­thol­ogy se­ries Hot Line (1994 to 1996).</p>
    <p>Her fi­nal screen ap­pear­ance was on the Show­time se­ries Bar­ber­shop in 2005.</p>
    <p>Even in her hey­day, Roberts ap­peared not to en­joy be­ing in­ter­viewed.</p>
    <p>Chat­ting with tele­vi­sion host Johnny Car­son on The Tonight Show in 1981, she laughed ner­vously, gave short an­swers and flirted with ac­tor Michael Lan­don, her fel­low guest.</p>
    <p>At one point, Car­son men­tioned a cover ar­ti­cle about her in Peo­ple mag­a­zine, prompt­ing Ed McMa­hon, the host’s side­kick, to sug­gest, “Maybe there’s some­thing in the mag­a­zine that’d be in­ter­est­ing.”</p>
    <p>Roberts was a teenager when she mar­ried in 1971, but the union was quickly an­nulled at the in­sis­tence of her new mother-in-law.</p>
    <p>In 1974, she met Mr Barry Roberts, a psy­chol­ogy stu­dent, while both were stand­ing in line at a movie the­atre. They mar­ried that year. Mr Roberts be­came a screen­writer and died in 2006 at 60.</p>
    <p>In ad­di­tion to Mr O’Brien, she is sur­vived by a sis­ter, Bar­bara Chase, who was late psy­chol­o­gist Ti­mothy Leary’s fourth wife.</p>
