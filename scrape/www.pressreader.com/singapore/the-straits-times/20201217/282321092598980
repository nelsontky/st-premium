    <p>Sin­ga­pore has signed a mem­o­ran­dum of un­der­stand­ing (MOU) with the United States to deepen eco­nomic co­op­er­a­tion and ex­tend trade fi­nanc­ing and in­vest­ment sup­port to each other’s com­pa­nies.</p>
    <p>The MOU aims to im­prove the avail­abil­ity of and ac­cess to trade fi­nanc­ing op­tions for com­pa­nies from both coun­tries, said the Min­istry of Trade and In­dus­try (MTI) in a press re­lease yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>This will help rem­edy the global tight­en­ing of credit fol­low­ing the eco­nomic slow­down caused by the Covid-19 pan­demic, said the MTI.</p>
    <p>It will also fa­cil­i­tate bi­lat­eral trade in goods and ser­vices to en­hance growth op­por­tu­ni­ties.</p>
    <p>The US is Sin­ga­pore’s largest for­eign in­vestor, while the Repub­lic was the US’ fourth-largest Asian in­vestor last year.</p>
    <p>The MOU also seeks to strengthen co­op­er­a­tion on in­vest­ment pro­mo­tion and pro­vide op­por­tu­ni­ties for both coun­tries to ex­plore the use of tech­nol­ogy such as fin­tech to ad­dress new trade fi­nanc­ing and in­vest­ment chal­lenges.</p>
    <p>The agree­ment was signed sep­a­rately by Min­is­ter for Trade and In­dus­try Chan Chun Sing and US Sec­re­tary of Com­merce Wil­bur Ross.</p>
    <p>“As like-minded part­ners, Sin­ga­pore and the US are com­mit­ted to sup­port­ing our busi­nesses as they re­spond to the global eco­nomic dis­rup­tions caused by Covid-19,” said Mr Chan.</p>
    <p>“Through this MOU, we will fa­cil­i­tate com­pany in­vest­ments into Sin­ga­pore and the US, and help busi­nesses ac­cess more trade fi­nanc­ing fa­cil­i­ties,” he added.</p>
    <p>“We also look for­ward to catalysing greater trade and in­vest­ment flows be­tween the US, Sin­ga­pore and South-east Asia, and en­abling our com­pa­nies to con­tinue trad­ing and ac­cess­ing op­por­tu­ni­ties in these chal­leng­ing times.”</p>
    <p>The press re­lease quoted Mr Ross as say­ing that the US and Sin­ga­pore “have en­joyed more than 50 years of of­fi­cial part­ner­ship since we es­tab­lished diplo­matic ties in 1966”.</p>
    <p>The MOU, he added, will help Sin­ga­pore im­porters fi­nance the pur­chase of US ex­ports and sup­port Sin­ga­pore in­vestors look­ing at op­por­tu­ni­ties in the US.</p>
    <p>The re­new­able, two-year MOU will be over­seen by MTI and the US De­part­ment of Com­merce. It will be sup­ported by im­ple­ment­ing agen­cies such as En­ter­prise Sin­ga­pore, the Ex­port-Im­port Bank of the US and the US Com­mer­cial Ser­vice in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>Said the MTI: “The MOU is the lat­est tan­gi­ble re­sult of the ro­bust eco­nomic and in­vest­ment part­ner­ship be­tween the US and Sin­ga­pore.”</p>
    <p>The agree­ment made in the fi­nal weeks of US Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump’s ad­min­is­tra­tion comes af­ter Sin­ga­pore last week signed a free trade agree­ment with Bri­tain, the first such deal be­tween that coun­try and an Asean mem­ber state.</p>
    <p>The MOU, US Sec­re­tary of Com­merce Wil­bur Ross added, will help Sin­ga­pore im­porters fi­nance the pur­chase of US ex­ports and sup­port Sin­ga­pore in­vestors look­ing at op­por­tu­ni­ties in the US.</p>
