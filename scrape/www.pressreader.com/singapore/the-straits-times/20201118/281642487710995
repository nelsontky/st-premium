    <p>Even as the lo­cal tech ta­lent pool grows, Sin­ga­pore has to bring in for­eign pro­fes­sion­als at mid- to se­nior levels to build world-class teams, grow the in­dus­try and tackle ur­gent prob­lems, said Prime Min­is­ter Lee Hsien Loong yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>He ac­knowl­edged the sense of com­pe­ti­tion and dis­com­fort that can arise from large num­bers of for­eign­ers in the in­dus­try, and said Sin­ga­pore­ans have to feel as­sured that they are fairly treated.</p>
    <p>They must see that tech com­pa­nies are bring­ing in peo­ple with ex­per­tise and ex­pe­ri­ence, whom Sin­ga­pore­ans can learn from, he said.</p>
    <p>Speak­ing at the Sin­ga­pore Tech Fo­rum that is be­ing held vir­tu­ally, PM Lee said that while the coun­try has a sup­port­ive en­vi­ron­ment for tech­nol­ogy in terms of in­fra­struc­ture, the key fac­tor is ta­lent.</p>
    <p>“We need more tech ta­lent to grow the in­dus­try, and to tackle the ur­gent prob­lems that we have and that tech can help us to solve.”</p>
    <p>Lo­cal uni­ver­si­ties and poly­tech­nics are pro­duc­ing more grad­u­ates who are in de­mand, but com­pa­nies also need to bring in over­seas pro­fes­sion­als at higher levels who are in short sup­ply here, he noted.</p>
    <p>Such pro­fes­sion­als help create a vir­tu­ous cir­cle by ex­pand­ing Sin­ga­pore’s ta­lent pool, rais­ing stan­dards and strength­en­ing the tech ecosys­tem here, said PM Lee.</p>
    <p>But he also noted that so­cial fric­tions can de­velop, es­pe­cially if there are large con­cen­tra­tions from a sin­gle source and there is an eco­nomic down­turn. Such ten­sions are not unique to Sin­ga­pore, he said, adding that the Gov­ern­ment will do its best to ad­dress them.</p>
    <p>He said for­eign­ers must make the ef­fort to fit in here, and at the same time, Sin­ga­pore­ans have to feel that they are not dis­crim­i­nated against.</p>
    <p>“They have got to see the tech com­pa­nies as bring­ing in ex­per­tise and ex­pe­ri­ence, (and) build­ing up the in­dus­try and ca­pa­bil­i­ties,” said</p>
    <p>PM Lee. “So that our own peo­ple can learn from them, up­grade them­selves and even­tu­ally build up our own ta­lent pool.”</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore has done so in the past with the petro­chem­i­cal, bio­med­i­cal and semi­con­duc­tor in­dus­tries, he added.</p>
    <p>He also held up the Gov­ern­ment’s new Tech.Pass work pass, which will al­low for­eign­ers to start and op­er­ate a busi­ness, serve on the board of a Sin­ga­pore-based com­pany or be a share­holder or in­vestor in com­pa­nies here. They can also take up lec­tur­ing roles, serve as an ad­viser to com­pa­nies here and con­duct cor­po­rate train­ing. Can­di­dates must show they are high-level tech pro­fes­sion­als.</p>
    <p>“The Tech.Pass scheme is aimed at highly ac­com­plished tech ta­lent, the movers and shak­ers of the tech world – peo­ple who usu­ally play dif­fer­ent roles at once: founder, in­vestor, em­ployee, con­sul­tant, aca­demic. Peo­ple who can con­trib­ute to mul­ti­ple parts of the ecosys­tem with their cap­i­tal, their networks, their knowl­edge,” said PM Lee.</p>
    <p>He added that un­like the Em­ploy­ment Pass where an in­di­vid­ual is tied to a par­tic­u­lar job or em­ployer, Tech.Pass will be per­sonal to the holder and al­low them to move be­tween roles and em­ploy­ers – a flex­i­bil­ity meant to make Sin­ga­pore more at­trac­tive to such ta­lent.</p>
    <p>At the di­a­logue that fol­lowed, PM Lee was asked about chal­lenges Sin­ga­pore faces in re­al­is­ing its Smart Na­tion am­bi­tions. While the “will” to transform dig­i­tally is present, the lack of ta­lent is an is­sue, he said.</p>
    <p>He was also asked about Sin­ga­pore’s ap­proach to les­bian, gay, bi­sex­ual, trans­gen­der and queer peo­ple, to which he said they are wel­come here and their con­tri­bu­tions are greatly ap­pre­ci­ated, but that so­ci­ety is still con­ser­va­tive.</p>
    <p>The four-day fo­rum, which started yes­ter­day, is or­gan­ised by the Sin­ga­pore Global Net­work and Gov­ern­ment Tech­nol­ogy Agency.</p>
    <p>(Over­seas pro­fes­sion­als at higher levels) help create a vir­tu­ous cir­cle by ex­pand­ing Sin­ga­pore’s ta­lent pool, rais­ing stan­dards and strength­en­ing the tech ecosys­tem here, said PM Lee.</p>
