    <p>LOS AN­GE­LES • Amer­i­can direc­tor Spike Lee (left) kicked off a unique Toronto film fes­ti­val on Thurs­day with a trib­ute to black vic­tims of po­lice vi­o­lence, as his lat­est movie pre­miered on­line and at drive-in screen­ings due to the coronaviru­s.</p>
    <p>With a pandemic and a closed Cana­dian bor­der forc­ing Hol­ly­wood stars and me­dia to re­main home, North Amer­ica’s big­gest film fes­ti­val has scram­bled to find so­cially dis­tanced ways to present this year’s line-up.</p>
    <p>Even di­rec­tors have stayed away, mean­ing that David Byrne’s Amer­i­can Utopia – Lee’s movie ver­sion of the Talk­ing Heads mu­si­cian’s Broad­way con­cert – of­fi­cially opened the fes­ti­val by stream­ing on the Web.</p>
    <p>The un­usual for­mat did not dampen reviews.</p>
    <p>Dead­line Hol­ly­wood said the film “isn’t just a con­cert doc, but also a life-af­firm­ing, eupho­ria-pro­duc­ing, soul-en­er­gis­ing sing-along protest film that’s ask­ing us to rise up against our own com­pla­cency”.</p>
    <p>In the film, which meshes themes of com­mu­nity and bat­tling in­jus­tice, Lee projects images of Mr Eric Garner, Ms Bre­onna Tay­lor and Mr Ge­orge Floyd – all African Amer­i­cans killed by po­lice – over a rous­ing protest song.</p>
    <p>The an­them fea­tures a call-and-re­sponse chant of “Say his name” for each black vic­tim – a theme Lee, 63, has cov­ered ex­ten­sively over his long ca­reer.</p>
    <p>“It feels like this year, in par­tic­u­lar, what he’s been say­ing for decades is res­onat­ing with a lot more peo­ple,” fes­ti­val co-head Cameron Bai­ley said.</p>
    <p>“It does feel like it is ex­actly the film for the mo­ment... it gives David and Spike the op­por­tu­nity to re­ally fo­cus the au­di­ence’s at­ten­tion on is­sues of anti-black racism of the Black Lives Mat­ter move­ment,” he added.</p>
    <p>The Toronto In­ter­na­tional Film Fes­ti­val typ­i­cally draws half a mil­lion at­ten­dees to its celebri­tys­tud­ded red car­pets and world pre­mieres, which in­clude Os­car hope­fuls and ob­scure art­house flicks hop­ing to find dis­trib­u­tors.</p>
    <p>This year, due to Covid-19, only movie lovers who are al­ready based in town can at­tend phys­i­cal screen­ings at a dra­mat­i­cally pared-down fes­ti­val boast­ing j ust 50 fea­ture films on show – com­pared with a typ­i­cal 300-odd.</p>
    <p>On Thurs­day, small crowds gathered at drive-ins, a lake­side open-air screen and a hand­ful of lim­ited-ca­pac­ity in­door theatres to watch Lee’s movie, as well as French de­but fea­ture Spring Blos­som by direc­tor Suzanne Lin­don.</p>
