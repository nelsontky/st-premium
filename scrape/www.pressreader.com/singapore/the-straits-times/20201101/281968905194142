    <p>The Na­tional Uni­ver­sity of Sin­ga­pore (NUS) will lift zon­ing re­stric­tions from Dec 6, in the wake of the low num­ber of Covid-19 com­mu­nity cases in re­cent weeks.</p>
    <p>In­tro­duced in June, the mea­sure is meant to min­imise in­ter­min­gling on cam­pus dur­ing the Covid-19 out­break.</p>
    <p>In two cir­cu­lars sent to stu­dents yes­ter­day, NUS said the lift­ing of the re­stric­tions from Dec 6 – which is the start of the uni­ver­sity va­ca­tion pe­riod – in­cludes the re­moval of mi­cro­zon­ing in the hos­tels.</p>
    <p>Stu­dents may re­turn to cam­pus on any day, re­gard­less if they have classes, from to­mor­row. But they must re­main in their re­spec­tive ac­tiv­ity zone.</p>
    <p>NUS said it made “this ev­i­dence-based de­ci­sion af­ter ex­am­in­ing cam­pus traf­fic data and tak­ing into con­sid­er­a­tion the views of stu­dent lead­ers from Na­tional Uni­ver­sity of Sin­ga­pore Stu­dents’ Union, the stu­dent lead­er­ship in hos­tels, fac­ulty clubs and other stu­dent or­gan­i­sa­tions”.</p>
    <p>The uni­ver­sity also stressed that it will con­tinue to align its safe man­age­ment mea­sures with pre­vail­ing gov­ern­ment guide­lines.</p>
    <p>Five self-suf­fi­cient zones were cre­ated on NUS cam­puses in June to min­imise over­crowd­ing and in­ter­min­gling. Each zone has its own din­ing and study ar­eas. The Uni­ver­sity Health Cen­tre and Vic­tim Care Unit are in a neu­tral zone and ac­ces­si­ble by all.</p>
    <p>Stu­dents who stay on cam­pus were as­signed a study zone, based on their fac­ulty or school, and a res­i­den­tial zone, ac­cord­ing to their hos­tel lo­ca­tion.</p>
    <p>The zon­ing has caused some un­hap­pi­ness due to the re­stric­tion of move­ments.</p>
    <p>To min­imise over­crowd­ing in the can­teens, NUS urged staff and stu­dents to avoid pa­tro­n­is­ing th­ese ar­eas dur­ing the lunchtime peak hour – be­tween 12pm and 1pm – where pos­si­ble.</p>
    <p>A new crowd sens­ing app, called Crowd In­sight, will also help to no­tify staff and stu­dents of the oc­cu­pancy load of the can­teens.</p>
    <p>“We en­cour­age every­one to use Crowd In­sight to check the oc­cu­pancy load be­fore vis­it­ing the can­teens,” the uni­ver­sity said.</p>
    <p>“The Covid-19 sit­u­a­tion is evolv­ing, with new in­ter­ven­tions in­tro­duced such as faster di­ag­nos­tics tests, TraceTo­gether to­kens, sewage test­ing and oth­ers to safe­guard pub­lic health. While we are lift­ing some of the strin­gent mea­sures we have put in place, we must not be com­pla­cent.”</p>
