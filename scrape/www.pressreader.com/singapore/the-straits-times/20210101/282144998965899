    <p>A two-week po­lice op­er­a­tion con­ducted from Dec 19 has re­sulted in the ar­rest of 230 peo­ple for their role in different scams in which vic­tims lost more than $2.9 mil­lion.</p>
    <p>The 388 ruses in­volved so­cial me­dia im­per­son­ation, Internet love scams, cheats us­ing fake gam­bling and loan plat­forms as well as fraud­u­lent e-com­merce deals.</p>
    <p>Some of the sus­pects were also picked up for be­ing money mules.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, the po­lice said that the Com­mer­cial Af­fairs Depart­ment-led op­er­a­tion, which also in­volved seven land di­vi­sions, led to the ar­rest of 151 men and 79 women. The youngest sus­pect is 16 years old and the oldest, 66.</p>
    <p>They are be­ing in­ves­ti­gated for the of­fence of cheat­ing or money laun­der­ing.</p>
    <p>Cheat­ing car­ries a prison term of up to 10 years and a fine. Money laun­der­ing in­volves jail time of up to 10 years, as well as a fine of up to $500,000.</p>
    <p>Po­lice data re­leased in Au­gust showed that the amount of money lost to scams had dou­bled to $82 mil­lion in the first half of last year, from $41.6 mil­lion in the same pe­riod in 2019.</p>
    <p>E-com­merce scams re­mained the most com­mon, with the num­ber of cases ris­ing by 73.8 per cent to 2,089 in the first half of last year, from 1,202 in the same pe­riod in 2019.</p>
    <p>The po­lice yes­ter­day said they take a se­ri­ous view of any per­son who may be in­volved in scams, and that per­pe­tra­tors will be dealt with in ac­cor­dance with the law.</p>
    <p>To avoid be­ing an ac­com­plice to crimes, mem­bers of the pub­lic should al­ways re­ject re­quests from oth­ers to use their bank ac­counts or mo­bile lines as they would be held ac­count­able if these are linked to il­le­gal trans­ac­tions, added the po­lice.</p>
    <p>For more in­for­ma­tion on scams, the pub­lic can visit www.sca­malert.sg or call the Anti-Scam Hot­line on 1800-722-6688.</p>
    <p>Any­one with in­for­ma­tion on such scams may call the po­lice hot­line on 1800-255-0000 or sub­mit in­for­ma­tion on­line at www.po­lice.gov.sg/iwit­ness</p>
