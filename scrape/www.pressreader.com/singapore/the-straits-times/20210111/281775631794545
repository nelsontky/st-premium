    <p>The lat­est provo­ca­tion by US Sec­re­tary of State Mike Pom­peo to re­lax re­stric­tions on its of­fi­cials’ in­ter­ac­tions with Tai­wan will clearly not go down well in Bei­jing, but com­ing up with the right re­sponse can prove tricky for Chi­nese lead­ers at this junc­ture.</p>
    <p>China is seek­ing to re­build crum­bled ties with the in­com­ing Bi­den ad­min­is­tra­tion, with For­eign Min­is­ter Wang Yi go­ing as far as de­scrib­ing the tran­si­tion to a new lead­er­ship as pre­sent­ing “a new win­dow of hope”. Yet, Tai­wan re­mains the most touchy is­sue and a peren­nial po­ten­tial flash­point be­tween the two coun­tries, and for China, the most im­por­tant of its “core in­ter­ests”.</p>
    <p>If Bei­jing re­sponds strongly, it might in­duce a tough­ened bi­par­ti­san at­ti­tude to­wards China in the US, but nei­ther can it af­ford to be seen as be­ing weak on this crit­i­cal sov­er­eign is­sue, which could come with po­lit­i­cal costs.</p>
    <p>“They could try to pres­sure Tai­wan some more but they are al­ready do­ing a lot – from in­creased sor­ties of mil­i­tary air­craft and mil­i­tary ex­er­cises near Tai­wan, to ef­forts at try­ing to chal­lenge Tai­wan in­ter­nally via lo­cal prox­ies, at­tempts at dele­git­i­mat­ing and iso­lat­ing Tai­wan diplo­mat­i­cally, and cy­ber at­tacks,” said As­so­ciate Pro­fes­sor Chong Ja Ian, who re­searches Chi­nese for­eign pol­icy and US-China re­la­tions at the Na­tional Univer­sity of Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>Tai­wan in Au­gust ac­cused four Chi­nese-backed hack­ing groups of in­fil­trat­ing at least 10 of its gov­ern­ment agen­cies to steal data.</p>
    <p>“Op­tions for Bei­jing at this point are not straight­for­ward, es­pe­cially if it wished to avoid sit­u­a­tions where it can­not man­age es­ca­la­tion. It could try to do more of the same in the ef­fort to ex­act some pun­ish­ment on Tai­wan, but such ac­tion will al­most cer­tainly fur­ther har­den at­ti­tudes in Tai­wan to­wards China,” said Prof Chong.</p>
    <p>Public sen­ti­ments in Tai­wan to­wards main­land China have grown in­creas­ingly sour, as Bei­jing steps up its pres­sure on the is­land.</p>
    <p>A Pew Re­search Cen­tre sur­vey last May showed 61 per cent of re­spon­dents in Tai­wan held un­favourable views of China.</p>
    <p>The Chi­nese lead­er­ship ap­pears to un­der­stand that this lat­est salvo from Mr Pom­peo is yet an­other at­tempt by the Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion to ramp through anti-China poli­cies be­fore Pres­i­dent-elect Joe Bi­den takes of­fice.</p>
    <p>When asked about Mr Pom­peo’s an­nounce­ment last Thurs­day that he was send­ing United Na­tions Am­bas­sador Kelly Craft to Tai­wan this week to show “what a free</p>
    <p>China could achieve”, For­eign Min­istry spokesman Hua Chun­y­ing de­scribed the move as “fi­nal mad­ness” by a few anti-China politi­cians in the Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion who are “un­scrupu­lously us­ing the re­main­ing days in of­fice to sab­o­tage China-US re­la­tions and serve their per­sonal po­lit­i­cal gains”.</p>
    <p>Yet, China is con­fronted by fears that the Bi­den White House might not un­ravel some of these Trump-era poli­cies.</p>
    <p>In a warn­ing to the in­com­ing ad­min­is­tra­tion, Ms Hua said China will do what­ever it takes to safe­guard its sov­er­eign in­ter­ests, and if the US per­sists in such mea­sures, “it will pay a heavy price for its wrong words and deeds”.</p>
