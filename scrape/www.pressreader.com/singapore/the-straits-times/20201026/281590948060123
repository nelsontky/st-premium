    <p>Malaysia’s King has re­jected a con­tro­ver­sial pro­posal by Prime Min­is­ter Muhyid­din Yassin to im­pose emer­gency mea­sures in the coun­try to tackle the pan­demic with­out po­lit­i­cal dis­trac­tions. The King’s de­ci­sion has thrown Malaysia into a state of po­lit­i­cal un­cer­tainty.</p>
    <p>In the lat­est twist to Malaysia’s on­go­ing po­lit­i­cal saga, its King sur­pris­ingly re­jected a con­tro­ver­sial plan pro­posed by Prime Min­is­ter Muhyid­din Yassin to im­pose emer­gency mea­sures on the coun­try, af­ter dis­cussing the mat­ter with other state monar­chs.</p>
    <p>Tan Sri Muhyid­din’s sug­ges­tion was os­ten­si­bly aimed at tack­ling the Covid-19 pan­demic with­out po­lit­i­cal dis­trac­tions. His op­po­nents, how­ever, claimed he no longer com­manded ma­jor­ity sup­port in Par­lia­ment, and was us­ing the pan­demic as an ex­cuse to stay in power.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, the King re­jected his pro­posal while of­fer­ing him ver­bal sup­port in the on­go­ing po­lit­i­cal un­cer­tainty.</p>
    <p>“The gov­ern­ment has man­aged the pan­demic well and ef­fec­tively and the King be­lieves the gov­ern­ment un­der the lead­er­ship of Prime Min­is­ter Muhyid­din Yassin can con­tinue im­ple­ment­ing its poli­cies and en­force­ment mea­sures to curb the spread of the pan­demic,” said the royal comptrolle­r Ah­mad Fadil Sham­sud­din. “There is no need at this time for His Majesty to de­clare an emer­gency in this coun­try or any part of Malaysia.”</p>
    <p>The pro­posal, which would have sus­pended Par­lia­ment, had drawn flak for be­ing ex­ces­sive, and for pro­vid­ing Mr Muhyid­din’s em­bat­tled ad­min­is­tra­tion a means to avoid hav­ing its ma­jor­ity tested when the Lower House re­con­venes next month.</p>
    <p>De­spite re­ject­ing the emer­gency plan, the re­marks from the Palace yes­ter­day ap­peared to en­dorse Mr Muhyid­din’s gov­ern­ment.</p>
    <p>The King, Sultan Ab­dul­lah Ah­mad Shah, called on par­lia­men­tar­i­ans to cease all pol­i­tick­ing and not</p>
    <p>to desta­bilise the ex­ist­ing gov­ern­ment. He also stressed that Bud­get 2021, which will be tabled in Par­lia­ment on Nov 6, is cru­cial in ad­dress­ing the Covid-19 pan­demic and re­vi­tal­is­ing the economy.</p>
    <p>“There is no need for MPs to con­tinue ir­re­spon­si­ble ac­tions that can threaten the sta­bil­ity of the ex­ist­ing gov­ern­ment,” said Datuk Fadil.</p>
    <p>The Cab­i­net de­ci­sion to re­quest emer­gency mea­sures had come amid grow­ing un­cer­tainty over Mr Muhyid­din’s con­trol of Par­lia­ment ahead of a vote on next year’s Bud­get.</p>
    <p>Mr Muhyid­din’s Perikatan Na­sional (PN) coali­tion gov­erns with a slim ma­jor­ity of 113 MPs in the 222-strong Lower House, and he faces sev­eral no-con­fi­dence mo­tions from his ri­vals. He also faces a chal­lenge from op­po­si­tion leader An­war Ibrahim who said late last month that he has a “for­mi­da­ble ma­jor­ity” to helm a new gov­ern­ment.</p>
    <p>Umno, the largest party in PN,</p>
    <p>had threat­ened to leave the al­liance, but later back­tracked and said it would sup­port PN.</p>
    <p>The Straits Times un­der­stands that Mr Muhyid­din was locked in deep dis­cus­sions with close ad­vis­ers and al­lies at his res­i­dence late into last night on how to re­act to the set­back. “I ap­pre­ci­ate His Majesty’s faith in the gov­ern­ment I lead and wel­come his ad­vice that the gov­ern­ment’s sta­bil­ity should not be threat­ened,” Mr Muhyid­din said in a state­ment late yes­ter­day, adding that the Cab­i­net would dis­cuss the royal de­cree.</p>
    <p>Emer­gency mea­sures, gov­ern­ment sources say, would have fore­stalled a Bud­get vote, and the need for the coun­try to hold a gen­eral elec­tion dur­ing a pan­demic, in the event Mr Muhyid­din’s gov­ern­ment fails to pass the Bud­get and prove its ma­jor­ity.</p>
    <p>Fed­eral Ter­ri­to­ries Min­is­ter An­nuar Musa had ear­lier said an emer­gency would be one way to le­gally</p>
    <p>de­lay up­com­ing elec­tions which have been of con­cern since last month’s Sabah’s polls saw in­fec­tions spike. A par­lia­men­tary by­elec­tion in Sabah is due on Dec 5, while Sarawak must also hold a state elec­tion by mid-next year.</p>
    <p>Malaysia is ex­pe­ri­enc­ing a third wave of in­fec­tions, with the to­tal num­ber of Covid-19 cases dou­bling within the month of Oc­to­ber alone.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, it recorded 823 new cases, all lo­cally trans­mit­ted, bring­ing the na­tional to­tal to 26,565. Eight more deaths were re­ported, bring­ing the to­tal to 229. Most new cases were from Sabah.</p>
    <p>The King yes­ter­day urged ev­ery­one, re­gard­less of po­lit­i­cal lean­ings, to set aside their dif­fer­ences and sup­port the gov­ern­ment in its ef­forts to curb the spread of the virus.</p>
    <p>The gov­ern­ment has man­aged the pan­demic well and ef­fec­tively and the King be­lieves the gov­ern­ment un­der the lead­er­ship of Prime Min­is­ter Muhyid­din Yassin can con­tinue im­ple­ment­ing its poli­cies and en­force­ment mea­sures to curb the spread of the pan­demic. There is no need at this time for His Majesty to de­clare an emer­gency in this coun­try or any part of Malaysia.</p>
    <p>ROYAL COMPTROLLE­R AH­MAD FADIL SHAM­SUD­DIN</p>
    <p>Politi­cians of both stripes and or­di­nary Malaysians re­acted swiftly in prais­ing the King’s de­ci­sion not to de­clare a state of emer­gency yes­ter­day, with the hash­tag #DaulatTuan­ku, or “Long live the King”, trend­ing on Twit­ter fol­low­ing the royal procla­ma­tion.</p>
    <p>Demo­cratic Ac­tion Party (DAP) vet­eran and l aw­maker Lim Kit Siang said the de­ci­sion shows that the “con­sti­tu­tional monar­chy proves to be an im­por­tant bul­wark of par­lia­men­tary democ­racy in Malaysia”.</p>
    <p>“Malaysians from all walks of life thank the Yang di-Per­tuan Agong, Sultan Ab­dul­lah Sultan Ah­mad Shah, for de­cid­ing not to de­clare a state of emer­gency af­ter a spe­cial meet­ing with Malay rulers to­day,” he said in a state­ment.</p>
    <p>He called on all Malaysians, es­pe­cially MPs, to unite to forge an “all-of­gov­ern­ment” and “whole-of-so­ci­ety” war against the third wave of the Covid-19 pan­demic.</p>
    <p>For­mer DAP min­is­ter Yeo Bee Yin tweeted: “What now? Fo­cus on fight­ing Covid, fo­cus on build­ing the economy, get con­fi­dence and sup­ply agree­ment work.”</p>
    <p>She was re­fer­ring to an ear­lier of­fer by sev­eral op­po­si­tion politi­cians to reach a cross-party deal with Prime Min­is­ter Muhyid­din Yassin in a “con­fi­dence and sup­ply” pact, where a party or a group of law­mak­ers agrees to sup­port the gov­ern­ment on mo­tions of con­fi­dence or Sup­ply Bills, in ex­change for re­forms.</p>
    <p>DAP vice-chair and for­mer min­is­ter M. Ku­lasegaran tweeted: “Daulat Tuanku. Thank you for al­ways be­ing the peo­ple’s King and do­ing what’s best for the na­tion. A de­ci­sion that comes as a re­lief to all Malaysians. Let’s put aside pol­i­tics and work to curb the spread of #Covid-19 and fo­cus on na­tion build­ing.”</p>
    <p>Umno vice-pres­i­dent Khaled Nordin said the de­ci­sion shows that the fed­eral Con­sti­tu­tion should not be used ar­bi­trar­ily.</p>
    <p>The King “as well as the Malay rulers have made a wise de­ci­sion not to de­clare a state of emer­gency and have truly taken the rakyat’s (peo­ple) in­ter­est into con­sid­er­a­tion”, he was quoted as say­ing by The Star daily.</p>
    <p>The short-lived pro­posal by Tan Sri Muhyid­din and his Perikatan Na­sional (PN) gov­ern­ment to de­clare a state of emer­gency and pos­si­bly sus­pend Par­lia­ment came ahead of a Nov 6 tabling of next year’s Bud­get, which looked to be in dan­ger of fall­ing through amid claims by Op­po­si­tion Leader An­war Ibrahim that he has wrested ma­jor­ity sup­port in Par­lia­ment from the Premier.</p>
    <p>Umno in­for­ma­tion chief Shahril Ham­dan urged all politi­cians to help pass next year’s Bud­get to sup­port the health­care sys­tem in the war against Covid-19.</p>
    <p>“I hope that politi­cians will fo­cus en­tirely on the Bud­get. Pri­ori­tise the peo­ple. That is the main re­spon­si­bil­ity as a leader.”</p>
    <p>For­mer premier Na­jib Razak also weighed in on the mat­ter.</p>
    <p>“If this gov­ern­ment is wor­ried that the 2021 Bud­get may not be passed, thus caus­ing PN to col­lapse, PN should hold talks with var­i­ous par­ties so the Bud­get will not be op­posed,” he said.</p>
    <p>Ne­ti­zens took to the In­ter­net to hail the de­ci­sion.</p>
    <p>Twit­ter user Pravin Snow posted:</p>
    <p>“Thank you beloved YDP (Yang diPer­tuan) Agong! Glad we rakyat have you as our shield of de­fence when the rest failed to pro­tect us. Daulat Tuanku!”</p>
    <p>An­other user, Sal­adin, wrote on Twit­ter: “We must praise our ‘rulers’ for their wis­dom who are in­de­pen­dent of pol­i­tics be­cause they know some­times our ‘politi­cians’ use them to fur­ther their ‘agenda’! Daulat Tuanku!”</p>
