    <p>Ms Sharon Koh, 42, di­rec­tor at Asia PR Werkz, a public re­la­tions and com­mu­ni­ca­tions agency</p>
    <p>“The So­cial Dilemma gave pen­e­trat­ing first-hand in­sights into the work­ings and in­cen­tives of today’s big tech com­pa­nies. But it also leaned al­most solely on the neg­a­tive side ef­fects of so­cial me­dia and glossed over the pos­i­tive as­pects on this big tech de­vel­op­ment.</p>
    <p>“One can­not deny that so­cial me­dia has cre­ated much pos­i­tive trans­for­ma­tive ef­fects on our so­ci­ety and the world at large. Hence, a fairer por­trayal with a bal­ance of counter-points is needed to start any mean­ing­ful so­cial dis­course on this topic.”</p>
    <p>Mr Calvin Siew, 42, di­rec­tor and dig­i­tal strate­gist at Klareco Com­mu­ni­ca­tions</p>
    <p>“I am not sur­prised The So­cial Dilemma is pop­u­lar with peo­ple of all ages. For some, the docu­d­rama was eye-open­ing about the im­pact of so­cial me­dia and the way the chan­nels are built to keep us on them for as long as pos­si­ble.</p>
    <p>“Once you come to terms with the fact that th­ese are busi­nesses and they need to show­case their value to share­hold­ers and po­ten­tial ad­ver­tis­ers, the use of such al­go­rithms should not be sur­pris­ing. After all, so­cial me­dia’s sell­ing point to brands is a cap­tive au­di­ence – eyes on the page.”</p>
    <p>Ms Karyen Chai, 31, an en­tre­pre­neur who founded Sol+, a lifestyle re­tail busi­ness sell­ing prod­ucts such as per­fumes and lava rock ac­ces­sories</p>
    <p>“I think schol­ars are try­ing to find a scape­goat for so­cial ills, which have hap­pened with or with­out so­cial me­dia. So­cial me­dia may have helped ac­cel­er­ate th­ese ills and help them spread fur­ther. But so­cial me­dia has also en­cour­aged and em­pow­ered, giv­ing voice to those who may not have been al­lowed to speak be­fore.</p>
    <p>“Per­son­ally, I ap­pre­ci­ate that I can keep in touch with my friends and fam­ily from all over the world through so­cial me­dia. I also ap­pre­ci­ate read­ing dif­fer­ent news sources be­cause of ac­ces­si­bil­ity to so­cial me­dia. As a busi­ness owner, I ap­pre­ci­ate the abil­ity to spread in­for­ma­tion about prod­ucts and con­tent in a low-cost man­ner.</p>
    <p>“On the other hand, so­cial me­dia can be very ad­dic­tive. I wish I had more time to read, in­stead of spend­ing all my time watch­ing one YouTube video after an­other, or scrolling through In­sta­gram.”</p>
