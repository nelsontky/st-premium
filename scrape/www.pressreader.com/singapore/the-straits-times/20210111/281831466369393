    <p>Mr Ra­jan R.S., a 49-year-old real es­tate dealer and su­per­fan of Tamil su­per­star Ra­jinikanth, wants to make one thing clear: Only true fans, not trou­ble­mak­ers, are protest­ing against the ac­tor’s an­nounce­ment that he is with­draw­ing his plans to en­ter pol­i­tics.</p>
    <p>Mr Ra­jan trav­elled over the week­end from Kanyaku­mari, where he is district or­gan­iser for the ac­tor’s of­fi­cial fan club, Ra­jini Makkal Man­dram, to join thou­sands of fans in Chennai, the cap­i­tal of the In­dian state of Tamil Nadu, in a protest to­day. The fans want their beloved ac­tor to con­test elec­tions as planned.</p>
    <p>Fans of the su­per­star known for his swash­buck­ling style and fire­cracker de­liv­ery have long wanted him to con­test elec­tions in Tamil Nadu. But from mak­ing big po­lit­i­cal state­ments in his movies – oc­ca­sion­ally voic­ing his pref­er­ence for can­di­dates – to claim­ing he was too spir­i­tual for pol­i­tics, Mr Ra­jinikanth has blown hot and cold about running for of­fice.</p>
    <p>In 2017, the 70-year-old ac­tor promised to launch a po­lit­i­cal party.</p>
    <p>He was set to an­nounce the party’s name on Dec 31 last year but changed his mind days be­fore that.</p>
    <p>Ad­mit­ted to hos­pi­tal for high blood pres­sure while shoot­ing a film, he cited his fail­ing health as a “warn­ing from god” to quit pol­i­tics.</p>
    <p>“I know that I might up­set a lot of my fans... with this de­ci­sion, but I don’t want to ruin the lives of thou­sands by pick­ing up some­thing I can­not ful­fil. De­spite the up­com­ing (Covid-19) vac­cine, it is still not the right time to be out in public (as that would) put many lives in dan­ger,” he wrote in a state­ment.</p>
    <p>With that, he brought 30 years of spec­u­la­tion about his po­lit­i­cal as­pi­ra­tions to an abrupt end.</p>
    <p>Mr Ra­jan was heart­bro­ken. Like many other fans, he felt a loss of pur­pose. “The day Ra­jini sir said he would launch a party and her­ald clean pol­i­tics in Tamil Nadu, we burst crackers. I quit my se­nior role in the state Congress party and ded­i­cated my­self to mak­ing him the chief min­is­ter of Tamil Nadu in 2021,” said Mr Ra­jan.</p>
    <p>Tamil Nadu has long voted its cin­ema heroes to po­lit­i­cal power. With the death of both Mr M. Karunanidh­i and Ms J. Jay­alalithaa, the war­ring iconic lead­ers who ruled the state by turn for decades, po­lit­i­cal ob­servers be­lieved there was no bet­ter time than the up­com­ing 2021 state leg­is­la­ture polls for Mr Ra­jinikanth to try his luck.</p>
    <p>For one thing, he is wildly pop­u­lar. There are 50,000 reg­is­tered Ra­jinikanth fan clubs. “There might be an equal num­ber of un­of­fi­cial fan clubs,” said Chennai-based Mr J. Ramki, a fan and a writer.</p>
    <p>In the past three years, Mr Ra­jinikanth’s fans have tried to build an elec­toral in­fra­struc­ture to sup­port him. “We built booth-level elec­tion com­mit­tees in al­most all 234 con­stituen­cies in the state. If Ra­jinikanth en­ters pol­i­tics, he has to win,” said Mr Subra­ma­niam R., a fan from Chennai.</p>
    <p>The ac­tor’s close as­so­ciate and Tamil scholar Tami­laruvi Ma­nian said the party by-laws, poli­cies and draft man­i­festo were ready in De­cem­ber 2019. Last year, the um­brella Ra­jini fan club re­named it­self the Ra­jini Makkal Man­dram (Peo­ple’s Fo­rum), sig­nalling a changed am­bi­tion.</p>
    <p>Mr Ra­jinikanth also ap­pointed a chief co­or­di­na­tor for the planned party, a for­mer state func­tionary of In­dian Prime Min­is­ter Naren­dra Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party. All that was left was to an­nounce the party’s name.</p>
    <p>But the ac­tor’s an­nounce­ment only con­firmed that he was ul­ti­mately re­luc­tant to en­ter pol­i­tics.</p>
    <p>When some fans an­nounced the mas­sive protest, oth­ers called such be­hav­iour dis­obe­di­ent. “The views ex­pressed by such in­di­vid­u­als do not re­flect our of­fi­cial po­si­tion in such mat­ters,” said Mr V.M. Sud­hakar, ad­min­is­tra­tor of the All In­dia Ra­jinikanth Fans As­so­ci­a­tion.</p>
    <p>But Mr Ra­jan said “it is not anger or ar­ro­gance but af­fec­tion and hope that is mak­ing us do this peace­ful protest”.</p>
    <p>Fans from across Tamil Nadu are now hop­ing to get their star to once again change his mind.</p>

It was part of a 100-day com&#xAD;mu&#xAD;nity out&#xAD;reach amid the coro&#xAD;n&#xAD;avirus pan&#xAD;demic ahead of the ac&#xAD;tor&#x2019;s foray into pol&#xAD;i&#xAD;tics. But he has de&#xAD;cided not to launch his planned po&#xAD;lit&#xAD;i&#xAD;cal party to con&#xAD;test elec&#xAD;tions.</p>
