    <p>The Dell XPS 13 has been the gold stan­dard for pre­mium Win­dows lap­tops.</p>
    <p>Even its less-in­spired it­er­a­tions have made the best-of-the-year list of many re­view­ers, in­clud­ing this one.</p>
    <p>This year’s model looks to be no ex­cep­tion. The lat­est XPS 13 re­tains the fa­mil­iar sleek de­sign of its pre­de­ces­sor and Dell has made a few tweaks that bring it closer to per­fec­tion.</p>
    <p>The screen, for i nstance, has nar­row bezels on all four sides, un­like last year’s model, which has a rel­a­tively thick bot­tom bezel.</p>
    <p>The keys are now larger, with Dell ex­tend­ing the key­board right to the left and right edges. Key travel is de­cent as the lap­top is only about 15mm thick.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, the smooth glass touch­pad has in­creased by 17 per cent in size, mak­ing multi-touch ges­tures eas­ier to ex­e­cute.</p>
    <p>Dell has man­aged to squeeze a tiny Web cam­era in the barely there top bezel and, more im­por­tantly, an in­frared cam­era along­side for fa­cial recog­ni­tion.</p>
    <p>Last year’s XPS 13 did not sup­port fa­cial recog­ni­tion and in­stead of­fered a fin­ger­print sen­sor in­te­grated in the power but­ton.</p>
    <p>This year’s ver­sion not only has the fin­ger­print sen­sor, but also sup­ports fa­cial recog­ni­tion.</p>
    <p>There is, how­ever, still room for im­prove­ment. For in­stance, I found it hard to grip the lid to open it as there is no pro­nounced notch at the front lip.</p>
    <p>And while I can open the lid with one hand, it takes a bit of ef­fort. I sup­pose Dell has to bal­ance the ease of open­ing the lid with en­sur­ing the touch­screen re­mains sta­ble when users are tap­ping on it.</p>
    <p>My other grouse is that the XPS 13 comes with one fewer USB-C port than last year’s model. It has two USB-C Thun­der­bolt 3 ports (that are also used to charge the lap­top) and a head­phone jack. Like re­cent XPS 13 mod­els, a don­gle is re­quired to con­nect an ex­ter­nal stor­age drive or a mon­i­tor. Dell in­cludes a USB-C to USB-A don­gle.</p>
    <p>I tested the sil­ver-and-white model, which has a glass-fi­bre palm rest that is more com­fort­able to touch than the lap­top’s stiff and rigid alu­minium chas­sis. The black ver­sion also has a car­bon-fi­bre palm rest.</p>
    <p>My souped-up model also comes with a crisp 4K (3,840 x 2,160 pix­els) touch­screen that is pro­tected by Corn­ing Go­rilla Glass 6. This screen is rated at 500 nits, which is ex­tremely bright. Thank­fully, there is an in­te­grated light sen­sor that ad­justs the screen bright­ness au­to­mat­i­cally ac­cord­ing to am­bi­ent light.</p>
    <p>The dis­play sup­ports Dolby Vi­sion, which is avail­able for those who subscribe to Net­flix’s pre­mium plan. The vi­su­als are ex­cel­lent for a lap­top screen – vi­brant but not overly sat­u­rated. The anti-glare coat­ing does a good job of keep­ing re­flec­tions in check de­spite the screen’s glossy fin­ish.</p>
    <p>In terms of com­put­ing hard­ware, the XPS 13 has a stan­dard con­fig­u­ra­tion with the lat­est com­po­nents, such as an In­tel Core i7-1065G7 chip, 16GB of sys­tem mem­ory and a 1TB solid-state drive.</p>
    <p>In the PCMark 10 bench­mark, it scored 3,976, which is sim­i­lar to that of the LG gram 17 (3,848). The LG uses the same In­tel pro­ces­sor, but has only 8GB of mem­ory.</p>
    <p>In The Straits Times video-loop bat­tery test, the XPS 13 clocked just un­der five hours, which is roughly two hours short of most ul­tra­books.</p>
    <p>This is likely due to the XPS 13’s bright 4K screen. See­ing as the XPS 13 has a de­cent-sized 52 watt-hour bat­tery, you should get much bet­ter up­time if you choose the 1,920 x 1,080-pixel screen op­tion in­stead.</p>
