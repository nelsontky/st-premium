    <p>GENEVA • Europe needs a “se­ri­ous ac­cel­er­a­tion” in the fight against the coro­n­avirus, a top World Health Or­gan­i­sa­tion (WHO) of­fi­cial has said, adding that a lack of con­tact-trac­ing ca­pac­ity could drive the dis­ease into the dark­ness.</p>
    <p>In Europe, the pic­ture is un­re­lent­ingly grim as a string of coun­tries re­ported record in­creases, led by France, which posted over 50,000 daily cases for the first time on Sun­day, while the con­ti­nent passed the thresh­old of 250,000 deaths.</p>
    <p>The re­gion ac­counted for 46 per cent of global cases and nearly onethird of deaths, Dr Mike Ryan, WHO’s top emer­gen­cies ex­pert, said on Mon­day.</p>
    <p>“Right now, we are well be­hind this virus in Europe, so get­ting ahead of it is go­ing to take some se­ri­ous ac­cel­er­a­tion in what we do,” Dr Ryan told a news con­fer­ence.</p>
    <p>Clin­i­cal ca­pac­ity to man­age Covid-19 hos­pi­talised pa­tients has in­creased in Europe and death rates are “very, very low”, Dr Ryan said, pay­ing tribute to health sys­tems and med­i­cal work­ers.</p>
    <p>“But we are see­ing a large num­ber of cases, we are see­ing wide­spread dis­ease, we are see­ing very, very high pos­i­tiv­ity rates and an in­creas­ing lack of ca­pac­ity to do any ef­fec­tive form of con­tact-trac­ing, which is fur­ther go­ing to drive the dis­ease into the dark­ness,” he said.</p>
    <p>“And many coun­tries are now fac­ing the spec­tre of shut­downs in the com­ing weeks. It is not a sit­u­a­tion where I’m sure any coun­try in Europe or in the world would want to be in,” he added.</p>
    <p>Dr Maria Van Kerkhove, WHO’s tech­ni­cal head for Covid-19, said: “We are still hope­ful that coun­tries will not have to go into th­ese so­called na­tional lock­downs.”</p>
    <p>WHO di­rec­tor-gen­eral Te­dros Ad­hanom Ghe­breye­sus said that dur­ing the first wave, Italy and Spain “took se­ri­ous ac­tion to pro­tect the vul­ner­a­ble but at the same time re­duce trans­mis­sion”, adding: “The com­bi­na­tion of this is very im­por­tant.”</p>
    <p>Dr Te­dros said govern­ments and cit­i­zens needed to do their share and must “do ev­ery­thing to min­imise trans­mis­sion”. “And that’s why we are say­ing, al­though we agree with the chief of staff (Mr Mark Mead­ows) that pro­tect­ing the vul­ner­a­ble is im­por­tant, but giv­ing up on con­trol is dan­ger­ous,” he said.</p>
    <p>He was re­fer­ring to com­ments that White House chief of staff Mark Mead­ows made to CNN on Sun­day, when he said: “We’re not go­ing to con­trol the pan­demic. We are go­ing to con­trol the fact that we get vac­cines, ther­a­peu­tics and other mit­i­ga­tion ar­eas.”</p>
