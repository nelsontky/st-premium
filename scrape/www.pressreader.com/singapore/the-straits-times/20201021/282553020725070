    <p>Be­ing a ge­net­i­cally mu­tated and so­cially iso­lated teenage as­sas­sin might come with a few perks, it seems.</p>
    <p>So says English ac­tress Esme Creed-Miles, who plays the ti­tle char­ac­ter in Hanna, a psy­cho­log­i­cal drama about a covert Amer­i­can gov­ern­ment pro­gramme that com­bines hu­man and wolf DNA to breed child su­per-sol­diers.</p>
    <p>But as dark as the char­ac­ter’s back­story is, Creed-Miles says as a young woman, she found it lib­er­at­ing to por­tray some­one who has grown up free from the usual gen­der norms and re­stric­tive so­cial con­ven­tions.</p>
    <p>The 20-year-old was speak­ing to re­porters in Los An­ge­les about the show, both sea­sons of which are now avail­able on Ama­zon Prime Video in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>She plays Hanna, a teenager who lives in a re­mote for­est in Poland, where she has been raised by a for­mer Cen­tral In­tel­li­gence Agency (CIA) op­er­a­tive played by Joel Kin­na­man (Sui­cide Squad, 2016) – the man who res­cued her from the CIA su­per-sol­dier pro­gramme that en­hanced the DNA of in­fants with wolf genes.</p>
    <p>Be­cause of that and the way she has been brought up, the char­ac­ter is ut­terly unique, the ac­tress says.</p>
    <p>Grow­ing up in the wilder­ness, “she’s used to the ruth­less­ness of na­ture and it high­lights both the hu­man­ity and that essence of the an­i­mal in us”.</p>
    <p>Hanna has also “grown up com­pletely ab­solved of mod­ern con­ven­tion and of the male gaze – so she has a very in­ter­est­ing take on gen­der and love and sex”, she adds.</p>
    <p>“And you then see how that un­folds and in­flu­ences her re­la­tion­ships with other peo­ple in the mod­ern world.”</p>
    <p>For Creed-Miles, who ap­peared in the indie com­edy-drama Mis­ter Lonely (2007) when she was a child, this proved to be rather free­ing.</p>
    <p>“As a young woman, it was a fan­tas­tic op­por­tu­nity, for 12, 13 hours of the day, to be as raw as I could pos­si­bly be, with­out any of that kind of in­ter­nalised misog­yny that I feel I have to un­pack all the time.</p>
    <p>“So, I think that’s what’s ex­cit­ing about her as a char­ac­ter – how ab­solved of con­ven­tion she is,” says the star, who is the daugh­ter of ac­tress Sa­man­tha Mor­ton, 43 (Mi­nor­ity Re­port, 2002).</p>
    <p>She also ap­pre­ci­ated how the char­ac­ter is vul­ner­a­ble yet strong.</p>
    <p>“We’re liv­ing in a cli­mate that’s all about strong fe­male char­ac­ters, which is so ex­cit­ing and I’m so grate­ful to be a part of that. But she’s also im­mensely vul­ner­a­ble.”</p>
    <p>And as a young woman, Hanna ap­proaches phys­i­cal fights dif­fer­ently.</p>
    <p>“You’ve got to use your ad­van­tages be­cause, you know, she is a small lit­tle girl. She’s got to gouge peo­ple’s eyes out and do all that s***,” Creed-Miles says.</p>
    <p>Se­ries cre­ator David Farr co-wrote the 2011 movie of the same name the se­ries is adapted from, which starred Saoirse Ro­nan, Eric Bana and Cate Blanchett.</p>
    <p>Joe Wright, who di­rected the film, had changed the orig­i­nal end­ing to Farr’s screen­play.</p>
    <p>“And so Hanna’s jour­ney of self­dis­cov­ery never re­ally reached the cul­mi­na­tion that the screen­play had,” says Farr, 50, who wrote the ac­claimed spy drama The Night Man­ager (2016).</p>
    <p>With the se­ries, the writer­pro­ducer set out to make the story both more com­plete and fe­male­cen­tric.</p>
    <p>“It was vi­tal to make it ev­ery­thing that tele­vi­sion does well, which is more like a novel, I guess – episodic, fol­low­ing the char­ac­ter arc and a psy­cho­log­i­cal com­ing-of-age drama.”</p>
    <p>And for those who saw the film, he promises there will not be too much rep­e­ti­tion.</p>
    <p>“Seventy-five per cent of this nar­ra­tive is com­pletely new, so it’s not a re­it­er­a­tion in that sense. It goes com­pletely into new ter­rain, new story and it cre­ates a world which we hope has a big fu­ture.”</p>
    <p>“Be­cause with­out spoil­ing the story too much, it ex­plores the idea of the cre­ation of a kind of youth that is scary,” he ex­plains.</p>
    <p>“It’s a kind of po­lit­i­cal con­spir­acy that is to­tally new and unique to this show, and which I think has the po­ten­tial for a lot of ex­plo­ration.”</p>
    <p>Hanna is avail­able on Ama­zon Prime Video.</p>
