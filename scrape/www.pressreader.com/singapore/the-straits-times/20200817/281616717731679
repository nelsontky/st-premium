    <p>When the coro­n­avirus be­gan to spread across the is­land in Fe­bru­ary, Ms Paige Tuieng and her hus­band made the dif­fi­cult de­ci­sion to call off their May wed­ding.</p>
    <p>After all, they had a small solem­ni­sa­tion cer­e­mony last year and saw no point in post­pon­ing the larger cel­e­bra­tion to an in­de­ter­mi­nate date, Ms Tuieng told The Straits Times.</p>
    <p>Six months on, the cou­ple have been able to re­cover only about half of the $11,000 to $12,000 in de­posits paid to var­i­ous wed­ding ven­dors. Com­pound­ing their woes is the fact that Ms Tuieng and her hus­band are also stretched as they work in two of the in­dus­tries hard­est hit by the pan­demic – events and avi­a­tion.</p>
    <p>The on­go­ing cri­sis has up­ended a num­ber of planned events for many peo­ple, lead­ing to dis­putes be­tween ven­dors that point to no-re­fund poli­cies and con­sumers who ar­gue that re­stric­tions make it im­pos­si­ble to pro­ceed with their plans.</p>
    <p>The Covid-19 (Tem­po­rary Mea­sures) Act was passed in April, al­low­ing par­ties to events, tourism and other con­tracts to sus­pend their obli­ga­tions for six months.</p>
    <p>This means that cou­ples at risk of for­feit­ing a de­posit placed with a wed­ding venue, for ex­am­ple, can ap­ply for an as­ses­sor ap­pointed by the Min­istry of Law to pre­vent this if the event was to be held on or after Feb 1, and booked be­fore March 25.</p>
    <p>Wed­ding ven­dors told The Straits Times they are ex­er­cis­ing flex­i­bil­ity for ex­ist­ing book­ings, but noted that they also have costs to bear.</p>
    <p>A spokesman for Grand Park Or­chard said that it works with third­party ven­dors and sup­pli­ers that pro­vide in­gre­di­ents, flow­ers and decor. “Some of these items are ei­ther per­ish­ables or items which we can­not keep stock of; it is not vi­able for busi­nesses to bear these costs.”</p>
    <p>Still, the ho­tel has been al­low­ing cou­ples to post­pone wed­ding ban­quets with at least three days’ no­tice at no ad­di­tional charge, given the cur­rent ex­ten­u­at­ing cir­cum­stances. Can­cel­la­tion re­quests are re­viewed on a case-by-case ba­sis, it said.</p>
    <p>Caterer Chilli Api said up to 50 book­ings for the year were af­fected by pan­demic-re­lated curbs, such as lim­its on wed­ding at­ten­dees and the cir­cuit breaker. It has of­fered cus­tomers the op­tion to can­cel or de­lay ban­quets without penalty, and most have opted to post­pone, said Mr Kuah Bing Cheng, busi­ness devel­op­ment man­ager for par­ent com­pany Chilli Padi Hold­ing. Losses have been min­i­mal as suf­fi­cient no­tice has pre­vented food wastage, he said.</p>
    <p>Raf­fles Ho­tel and Shangri-La Ho­tel, Sin­ga­pore have al­lowed cou­ples to can­cel or post­pone their wed­dings without penalty.</p>
    <p>In re­sponse to queries, the Min­istry of Law said that as­ses­sors con­sider the po­si­tions of both con­tract­ing par­ties be­fore mak­ing a de­ter­mi­na­tion. “The per­cep­tion among some cou­ples that they are en­ti­tled to a full re­fund is in­cor­rect. The Act will help them to avoid los­ing all of their de­posit, but the de­ter­mi­na­tions must be fair to the ven­dor too,” a spokesman said.</p>
    <p>Ms Tuieng, who re­sorted to an as­ses­sor three times after be­ing un­able to reach an agree­ment with ven­dors, said the process helped the cou­ple re­cover some money.</p>
    <p>But the en­tire ex­pe­ri­ence has been dis­ap­point­ing, she said. “I have al­ways em­pha­sised that I am not ask­ing for a 100 per cent re­fund, and it doesn’t have to be re­turned im­me­di­ately. But they all ask for 50 per cent and can’t jus­tify it.”</p>
    <p>As an events em­cee, Ms Tuieng, 31, has seen her in­come drop by up to 90 per cent. Five wed­ding cer­e­monies that she had been set to host have been post­poned to next year, she said. “I am a ven­dor too, so I un­der­stand where they are com­ing from. But if you pay me and I don’t work for it, it is not my money.”</p>
    <p>While sac­ri­fic­ing their wed­ding and some sav­ings has not been easy, the episode has brought the cou­ple closer to­gether, Ms Tuieng said.</p>
    <p>“I am thank­ful for the chance to see how we can com­ple­ment each other and work things out to­gether.”</p>
