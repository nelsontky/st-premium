    <p>SEIYUN (Ye­men) • Ye­men’s Seiyun Palace, one of the world’s largest mud-brick struc­tures, has be­come the war-torn coun­try’s lat­est her­itage site fac­ing po­ten­tial col­lapse as heavy rains and years of ne­glect take their toll.</p>
    <p>The de­te­ri­o­ra­tion of the bright white build­ing, rem­i­nis­cent of a gi­ant sand­cas­tle with rounded tur­rets at its cor­ners, re­flects Ye­men’s down­ward spi­ral since 2014, when Iran-backed Houthi rebels be­gan bat­tling the gov­ern­ment. A Saudiled coali­tion in­ter­vened in sup­port of the gov­ern­ment in 2015.</p>
    <p>The au­thor­i­ties have strug­gled to se­cure funds to main­tain im­por­tant sites such as the palace, now a mu­seum, in the city of Seiyun in cen­tral Hadra­mawt prov­ince.</p>
    <p>The build­ing has fallen into dis­re­pair, mak­ing it vul­ner­a­ble to floods that have hit the coun­try in re­cent months.</p>
    <p>Mr Ab­dul­lah Bar­mada, an en­gi­neer who spe­cialises in the restora­tion of his­tor­i­cal build­ings, ap­pealed for in­ter­na­tional as­sis­tance to save the struc­ture.</p>
    <p>He told Agence France-Presse: “It is dan­ger­ous and, if not quickly re­stored, it is at risk of col­laps­ing.</p>
    <p>“There is dam­age to the base of the struc­ture, the walls, the roofs and it needs to be fixed, and then rou­tinely main­tained.”</p>
    <p>The floods have killed scores of peo­ple and dam­aged Unesco-listed World Her­itage sites, in­clud­ing high-rise mud-brick “sky­scrapers” fur­ther west in Shibam.</p>
    <p>In Ye­men’s third city of Taez, the newly re­stored Na­tional Mu­seum was a ma­jor ca­su­alty last month, with parts of the for­mer Ot­toman palace re­duced to rub­ble.</p>
    <p>The Seiyun Palace – once home to the sul­tan of the Kathiris, who ruled much of the re­gion from the 1500s un­til the 20th cen­tury – opened its doors to the pub­lic in 1984.</p>
    <p>Mr Hussein Ai­darous, head of the depart­ment of an­tiq­ui­ties and mu­se­ums in Hadra­mawt, said that though the palace had sus­tained dam­age, it re­mained one of the few of its kind still stand­ing.</p>
    <p>“This large build­ing is con­sid­ered one of the most im­por­tant mud­brick build­ings in Ye­men and maybe even in the Ara­bian Penin­sula,” he told Agence FrancePres­se.</p>
    <p>The fa­cade of the seven-story ed­i­fice re­tains its orig­i­nal grandeur. Its im­pos­ing lines are fea­tured on</p>
    <p>Ye­men’s 1,000-riyal ban­knote, the high­est de­nom­i­na­tion, worth around US$4 (S$5.40).</p>
    <p>With reg­u­lar rows of win­dows that over­look a busy street, the palace seems to be in solid con­di­tion when viewed from out­side.</p>
    <p>How­ever, the in­te­rior shows clear signs of dam­age, with cracks in the walls and a par­tially col­lapsed roof.</p>
    <p>It shut af­ter the war broke out but par­tially re­opened last year, re­ceiv­ing a steady stream of vis­i­tors, mu­seum of­fi­cials said.</p>
    <p>Mu­seum direc­tor Said Bay­chout said the mu­seum show­cases items ex­ca­vated in the prov­ince, in­clud­ing tomb­stones that date back to the Stone Age and the dawn of civil­i­sa­tion in Ye­men.</p>
    <p>There are also Bronze Age stat­ues, and pot­tery and an­cient manuscript­s from the pre-Is­lamic pe­riod.</p>
    <p>But its most prized pos­ses­sions, Mr Bay­chout said, are stashed away for fear that one of Ye­men’s war­ring groups could tar­get them.</p>
    <p>“The mu­seum was closed at the start of the con­flict when Al-Qaeda en­tered Hadra­mawt and arte­facts were hid­den over fears of loot­ing, pil­lag­ing and dam­age,” he told Agence France-Presse.</p>
    <p>“Un­til now, the im­por­tant and rare arte­facts are hid­den in se­cret places.”</p>

        <p data-role="text">The palace of Sul&#xAD;tan Al Kathiri, also known as Seiyun Palace, in the city of Seiyun, Ye&#xAD;men, last year. En&#xAD;gi&#xAD;neers and ac&#xAD;tivists say the seven-storey palace is at risk of col&#xAD;laps&#xAD;ing due to flood&#xAD;ing and ne&#xAD;glect.</p>
