    <p>Since the start of phase two of the re­open­ing of Sin­ga­pore’s econ­omy on June 19, cus­tomers have been al­lowed to dine in at eater­ies – sub­ject to cer­tain rules. Here are some:</p>
    <p>• Sale and con­sump­tion of al­co­hol in all food and bev­er­age (F&B) es­tab­lish­ments are pro­hib­ited af­ter 10.30pm daily. But en­force­ment checks found that some restau­rants have con­tin­ued to serve al­co­hol be­yond the cur­few, with some eater­ies con­ceal­ing al­co­holic bev­er­ages in teapots and empty green tea bot­tles to avoid de­tec­tion.</p>
    <p>• A group of din­ers in an F&B out­let must not ex­ceed five, and keep a dis­tance of at least 1m be­tween groups. Gath­er­ings or groups of more than five are barred, even if they are split across mul­ti­ple ta­bles. There should also be no mix­ing or min­gling be­tween groups. How­ever, some restau­rants were found to have ac­cepted reser­va­tions or walk-ins of groups of more than five. Sev­eral eater­ies also sit th­ese din­ers to­gether at ta­bles with more than five.</p>
    <p>• If all mem­bers of a group of more than five are from the same house­hold, they will be al­lowed to en­ter F&B es­tab­lish­ments, or make book­ings. How­ever, they must sit at mul­ti­ple ta­bles, with no more than five per ta­ble and the ta­bles spaced at least 1m apart. Es­tab­lish­ments can re­quest to ver­ify din­ers’ claims that they are from the same house­hold, and re­ject din­ers from en­ter­ing at their dis­cre­tion. But eater­ies have found it dif­fi­cult to ver­ify din­ers’ iden­ti­ties, with­out in­fring­ing the cus­tomers’ pri­vacy.</p>
    <p>PENAL­TIES FOR OF­FENCES</p>
    <p>Un­der the Covid-19 (Tem­po­rary Mea­sures) Act passed in Par­lia­ment on April 7, first-time of­fend­ers face a fine of up to $10,000, jail of up to six months, or both.</p>
    <p>Sub­se­quent of­fend­ers can be fined up to $20,000, jailed for up to 12 months, or both. For first-time safe-dis­tanc­ing of­fences, in­di­vid­u­als face a $300 fine.</p>
    <p>The Min­istry of Health said on Sept 9 that busi­nesses and in­di­vid­u­als who flout the rules will have en­force­ment ac­tions taken against them for the first of­fence, with­out a warn­ing. Penal­ties could in­clude fines, clo­sures and pros­e­cu­tion, de­pend­ing on the sever­ity, it added.</p>
