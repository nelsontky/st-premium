    <p>•</p>
    <p>WASH­ING­TON The tele­phone call would have been laugh-out-loud ridicu­lous if it had not been so se­ri­ous.</p>
    <p>When Ms Tina Bar­ton picked up the phone, she found some­one from Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump’s cam­paign ask­ing her to sign a let­ter rais­ing doubts about the re­sults of the United States pres­i­den­tial elec­tion.</p>
    <p>The elec­tion that Ms Bar­ton, as the Repub­li­can clerk of the small Michi­gan city of Rochester Hills, had helped over­see.</p>
    <p>The elec­tion that she knew to be fair and ac­cu­rate be­cause she had helped make it so.</p>
    <p>The elec­tion that she had pub­licly de­fended amid threats that made her up­grade her home se­cu­rity sys­tem.</p>
    <p>“Do you know who you’re talk­ing to right now?” she asked the cam­paign of­fi­cial. Ev­i­dently not.</p>
    <p>If the Pres­i­dent hoped Repub­li­cans across the coun­try would fall in line be­hind his false and far­ci­cal claims that the elec­tion was some­how rigged on a mam­moth scale by a ne­far­i­ous multi­na­tional con­spir­acy, he was in for a sur­prise.</p>
    <p>Repub­li­cans in Wash­ing­ton may have in­dulged Mr Trump’s fan­tas­ti­cal as­ser­tions, but at the state and lo­cal lev­els, Repub­li­cans played a crit­i­cal role in re­sist­ing the mount­ing pres­sure from their own party to over­turn the vote af­ter Mr Trump fell be­hind on Nov 3.</p>
    <p>The three weeks that fol­lowed tested Amer­i­can democ­racy and demon­strated that the two-cen­tury-old sys­tem is far more vul­ner­a­ble to sub­ver­sion than many had imag­ined, even though the in­cum­bent Pres­i­dent lost by six mil­lion votes na­tion­wide.</p>
    <p>But in the end, the sys­tem stood firm against the most in­tense as­sault from an ag­grieved pres­i­dent in the na­tion’s his­tory be­cause of a Repub­li­can city clerk in Michi­gan, a Repub­li­can sec­re­tary of state in Georgia, a Repub­li­can county su­per­vi­sor in Ari­zona and Repub­li­can-ap­pointed judges in Penn­sylva</p>
    <p>NO PROOF FOR AL­LE­GA­TIONS</p>
    <p>nia and else­where.</p>
    <p>They re­futed con­spir­acy the­o­ries, cer­ti­fied re­sults, dis­missed law­suits and re­pu­di­ated a pres­i­dent of their own party, leav­ing him to thunder about a sup­posed plot that would have had to in­clude peo­ple who had voted for him, do­nated to him or even been ap­pointed by him.</p>
    <p>The des­per­ate ef­fort to hang on to of­fice over the will of the peo­ple ef­fec­tively ended when his own di­rec­tor of the Gen­eral Ser­vices Ad­min­is­tra­tion de­ter­mined that Demo­crat Joe Bi­den is the Pres­i­dent-elect and a judge Mr Trump put on the bench chas­tised him for lu­di­crous lit­i­ga­tion.</p>
    <p>“Free, fair elec­tions are the lifeblood of our democ­racy,” Judge Stephanos Bibas, ap­pointed by Mr Trump in 2017, wrote for a three­judge panel of the 3rd Cir­cuit Court of Ap­peals in Philadel­phia last Fri­day as it dis­missed the lat­est of dozens of le­gal claims filed by Mr Trump and his al­lies.</p>
    <p>“Charges of un­fair­ness are se­ri­ous. But call­ing an elec­tion un­fair does not make it so.</p>
    <p>“Charges re­quire spe­cific al­le­ga­tions and then proof. We have nei­ther here.”</p>
    <p>Pres­i­dent Trump is not aban­don­ing his drive to over­turn the elec­tion re­sults in Wis­con­sin, de­spite state of­fi­cials an­nounc­ing that a re­count in Mil­wau­kee county had only added to Mr Bi­den’s lead.</p>
    <p>“The Wis­con­sin re­count is not about find­ing mis­takes in the count, it is about find­ing peo­ple who have voted il­le­gally, and that case will be brought af­ter the re­count is over, on Monday or Tuesday,” tweeted Mr Trump on Satur­day.</p>
    <p>Twitter flagged his tweet about “many il­le­gal votes” for mak­ing a dis­puted claim about elec­tion fraud.</p>
    <p>Said Ms Bar­ton: “It’s just dev­as­tat­ing to see... how we have come, as a coun­try, to think that vi­o­lence and threats are the an­swer.</p>
    <p>“But now we have to go back and re­build voter trust and let peo­ple re­alise that our elec­tions are not rigged.”</p>
    <p>Charges of un­fair­ness are se­ri­ous. But call­ing an elec­tion un­fair does not make it so. Charges re­quire spe­cific al­le­ga­tions and then proof. We have nei­ther here.</p>
    <p>JUDGE STEPHANOS BIBAS</p>
