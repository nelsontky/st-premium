    <p>I read Arts Cor­re­spon­dent</p>
    <p>Olivia Ho’s re­port with much in­ter­est and a tinge of sad­ness (Pan­demic leaves book­shops in a bind, Sept 24).</p>
    <p>Like the fate of DVD rental shops at the hands of video-on-de­mand stream­ing ser­vices, the days of brick-and-mor­tar book­shops are num­bered due to dig­i­tal dis­rup­tion (Spoilt for choice amid flood of video-on-de­mand ser­vices, Sept 20). But I think all is not lost.</p>
    <p>Per­haps, these book­shops could band to­gether to mar­ket their books on­line.</p>
    <p>I am an avid reader and get a lot of joy from my books. I have taken a great deal of care to pre­serve some of my trea­sured books for pos­ter­ity be­cause pub­lish­ers may not think it worth their while to print them any­more or even to con­vert them into e-books.</p>
    <p>But to de­clut­ter my book­shelves, I have had to get rid of many of my books, too, and I have posted them for sale on Carousell. It was a better op­tion than throw­ing them away.</p>
    <p>Ms Ho’s re­port serves as a wake-up call for these “re­cy­cled or preloved books” sell­ers to re­or­gan­ise them­selves, to seek help to go into on­line sales and mar­ket­ing, es­pe­cially since the Gov­ern­ment is pro­vid­ing much help to those who are try­ing to make this tran­si­tion.</p>
