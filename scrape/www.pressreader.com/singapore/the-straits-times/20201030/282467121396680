    <p>Sin­ga­pore is fac­ing its tough­est cri­sis in a gen­er­a­tion, but it is in this time that the coun­try and its peo­ple find the re­silience and re­solve to take on the im­pos­si­ble.</p>
    <p>This is the mes­sage the Eco­nomic Devel­op­ment Board (EDB) is send­ing to the world in a new mar­ket­ing cam­paign video ti­tled Dear World, launched yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The 90-se­cond ad­ver­tise­ment was pub­lished on EDB’s so­cial me­dia plat­forms, in­clud­ing Face­book and YouTube. It was pro­duced with English and Man­darin voiceovers, with sub­ti­tles in Ger­man and Ja­panese as well.</p>
    <p>It is part of the in­vest­ment pro­mo­tion agency’s ef­forts to draw in­vestors to Sin­ga­pore amid its most dif­fi­cult eco­nomic cri­sis, and to un­der­line the Repub­lic’s com­mit­ment to re­main con­nected to the world as well as its open­ness to tal­ent, trade and in­vest­ment from the global com­mu­nity.</p>
    <p>Framed as an open let­ter to the world, the video high­lights how Sin­ga­pore, like it did when it faced ad­ver­sity in the past, is “not (look­ing) at what if, but what’s next”.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore­ans are “a peo­ple who stare im­pos­si­ble chal­lenges in the face and say no, we won’t be beaten”, the video’s nar­ra­tor adds.</p>
    <p>Mr Chng Kai Fong, man­ag­ing di­rec­tor of the EDB, told The Straits Times: “Through this cam­paign, we hope to re­mind the world that Sin­ga­pore is ready for busi­ness, even while the pan­demic rages.</p>
    <p>“But more im­por­tantly, we re­mind our­selves that we will ride through this storm, and fly again.”</p>
    <p>Among the part­ners fea­tured in the video and ac­knowl­edged by EDB in its posts are Changi Air­port, Sin­ga­pore Air­lines, Ger­man lo­gis­tics firm DB Schenker, tech gi­ant Google, and med­i­cal de­vice man­u­fac­turer Fore­front Med­i­cal Tech­nolo­gies.</p>
    <p>South Korean car­maker Hyundai, which re­cently broke ground for its in­no­va­tion cen­tre in Jurong where elec­tric cars will be built, is also fea­tured in the video.</p>
    <p>De­spite the Covid-19 pan­demic, Sin­ga­pore has con­tin­ued to draw in­ter­est from in­ter­na­tional com­pa­nies this year. For ex­am­ple, Ja­panese con­struc­tion firm Ka­jima Cor­po­ra­tion broke ground on its $100 mil­lion in­no­va­tion cen­tre at Changi Busi­ness Park in Au­gust, which will also serve as the com­pany’s Asia-Pa­cific head­quar­ters.</p>
    <p>Tech gi­ants such as Ama­zon, Rakuten and Ten­cent also look to be ex­pand­ing their pres­ence here, lever­ag­ing Sin­ga­pore’s strate­gic po­si­tion as a launch­pad into the fast­grow­ing South-east Asia re­gion.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore also came in at No. 1 for the se­cond year in a row in the IMD World Com­pet­i­tive­ness Rank­ing 2020, demon­strat­ing its strong eco­nomic per­for­mance glob­ally.</p>
    <p>But as its over­all eco­nomic out­look re­mains gloomy – the Min­istry of Trade and In­dus­try projects gross do­mes­tic prod­uct will shrink be­tween 5 per cent and 7 per cent for the year, and the Mon­e­tary Au­thor­ity of Sin­ga­pore said this week that re­cov­ery will take longer than in pre­vi­ous re­ces­sions – some see the video’s up­beat note help­ing to project con­fi­dence.</p>
    <p>Shar­ing the video in a Face­book post yes­ter­day, Min­is­ter for Trans­port Ong Ye Kung wrote: “A poignant mes­sage from EDB to the world – we may be in the tough­est cri­sis of our gen­er­a­tion, but we are ever ready, as al­ways, to take on im­pos­si­ble chal­lenges for the sur­vival and pros­per­ity of Sin­ga­pore.”</p>
