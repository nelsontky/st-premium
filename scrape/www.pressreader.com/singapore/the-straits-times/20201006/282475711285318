    <p>The Sin­ga­pore Reper­tory The­atre (SRT) will be the first com­pany to re­open its the­atre doors.</p>
    <p>Tues­days With Morrie, star­ring the­atre vet­er­ans Ramesh Pan­icker and Ben­jamin Chow, pre­views on Nov 1 and pre­mieres on Nov 4. Tick­ets go on sale to­day and the show will run till the first week of De­cem­ber.</p>
    <p>The play, based on j our­nal­ist Mitch Al­bom’s best-sell­ing 1997 mem­oir, fol­lows Al­bom as he vis­its his favourite univer­sity pro­fes­sor, who is dy­ing from Lou Gehrig’s dis­ease.</p>
    <p>The the­atre space will be dras­ti­cally re­con­fig­ured for new so­cial dis­tanc­ing needs. The seats will be taken out and cafe-style ta­bles and chairs will be put in place for this new pro­duc­tion.</p>
    <p>The au­di­ence ca­pac­ity is capped at 50, in line with the Na­tional Arts Coun­cil’s (NAC) re­cent pi­lot tri­als which have re­stricted au­di­ence num­bers at venues.</p>
    <p>Au­di­ences will have to use SafeEn­try as well as fill out a health dec­la­ra­tion form.</p>
    <p>SRT is also in­vest­ing in an an­timi­cro­bial sur­face treat­ment and dis­in­fect­ing ser­vice for the whole the­atre, in­clud­ing both front and back of house ar­eas, to en­sure safety for both au­di­ences and per­form­ers.</p>
    <p>SRT man­ag­ing di­rec­tor Char­lotte Nors, 53, says: “Even though we may have only 50 peo­ple a night watch­ing, which is com­pletely un­vi­able fi­nan­cially, it is our pas­sion and ded­i­ca­tion to keep­ing the­atre alive that has fu­elled our de­sire to plough ahead.”</p>
    <p>The­atre venues have been closed since March 26 as part of mea­sures to con­trol the spread of Covid-19.</p>
    <p>Since Sept 11, how­ever, the NAC has been con­duct­ing small-scale pi­lot tri­als to pre­pare for the re­open­ing of per­for­mance venues.</p>
    <p>The Min­istry of Cul­ture, Com­mu­nity and Youth and NAC will re­view the re­sults of these tri­als af­ter this month.</p>
    <p>While the SRT is the first com­pany with a venue to re­open, other arts groups are of­fer­ing lim­ited tick­eted shows as part of the pi­lots. The Fin­ger Play­ers, for ex­am­ple, is stag­ing Peep­bird at the Es­planade’s Recital Stu­dio to­mor­row and on Thurs­day.</p>
    <p>The Gov­ern­ment has been al­low­ing some sec­tors to re­open, in­clud­ing houses of wor­ship and con­ven­tions. But the NAC has said that cer­tain per­for­mance gen­res, such as cho­ral singing and play­ing of wind in­stru­ments, carry ad­di­tional risks which is why the re­open­ing of the arts in­dus­try is pro­ceed­ing with more cau­tion.</p>
