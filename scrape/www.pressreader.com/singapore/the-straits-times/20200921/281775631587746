    <p>It was 10pm on Satur­day. Weary young protesters were pack­ing up their gear to leave Sanam Luang, or Royal Field, next to Bangkok’s Grand Palace and head home.</p>
    <p>Daeng – who wanted to be known only by the nick­name – 70, camp­ing out on her straw mat un­der a tree for the overnight protest, called out: “Don’t give up, kids! Make sure you come back to­mor­row morn­ing!”</p>
    <p>Daeng is a “red shirt” sup­porter who still re­mem­bers be­ing tear-gassed in the heart of Bangkok dur­ing the po­lit­i­cal tur­bu­lence of 2010. Like many other red shirts, she joined the week­end protest by stu­dent group United Front of Tham­masat and Demon­stra­tion. It turned the event into a re­union of sorts for age­ing ac­tivists from a net­work that Thai­land’s rul­ing es­tab­lish­ment tried to dis­man­tle af­ter the 2014 coup.</p>
    <p>But Daeng this time es­chewed red and wore a black shirt. “I want to fol­low the kids,” she told The Straits Times.</p>
    <p>By any mea­sure, the Sanam</p>
    <p>Luang protest was ex­tra­or­di­nary. Tens of thou­sands of protesters oc­cu­pied a field nor­mally fenced off for royal events and called it the “peo­ple’s field”. Protest lead­ers di­rectly ad­dressed King Maha Va­ji­ra­longkorn on stage. They tried to sub­mit a list of de­mands for po­lit­i­cal re­form – not to Prime Min­is­ter Prayut Chan-o-cha, but to the monarch via his Privy Coun­cil pres­i­dent Su­rayud Chu­lanont. They</p>
    <p>then called for a boy­cott of Siam Com­mer­cial Bank, of which the King is a ma­jor share­holder.</p>
    <p>In the process of try­ing to make “what was pre­vi­ously un­sayable, sayable”, the stu­dents drew sup­port over the week­end from foot sol­diers of the red shirt move­ment, noted Chu­la­longkorn Uni­ver­sity po­lit­i­cal sci­en­tist Kho­rapin Phuaphan­sawat. “It showed that red shirts haven’t dis­ap­peared. They haven’t been crushed.”</p>
    <p>Key red shirt lead­ers, faced with law­suits and other forms of pres­sure, stayed away.</p>
    <p>It re­mains to be seen if the de­mands for monar­chy re­form will res­onate with the larger Thai so­ci­ety, said an­a­lysts. For many, this topic re­mains un­think­able, given how the King’s late fa­ther Bhu­mi­bol Adulyadej was con­sid­ered a demigod. The lese ma­jeste law hangs over any­one dar­ing to openly crit­i­cise the roy­alty, even though it has not been used re­cently.</p>
    <p>Main­stream Thai broad­cast­ers widened cover­age of this protest, un­like pre­vi­ous ones live-streamed only by al­ter­na­tive me­dia.</p>
    <p>Dr Kho­rapin said the move­ment is still not widely known or ac­knowl­edged among Bangkok’s elite and the lower strata of Thai­land’s work­ing class. It is also too early to tell how in­tel­lec­tu­als will re­spond, she added.</p>
    <p>Among the roy­al­ist elite who have pre­vailed af­ter Thai­land’s most re­cent coups, the red shirts are of­ten seen as hill­bil­lies paid by cor­rupt politi­cians to oc­cupy Bangkok’s streets and re­spon­si­ble for plung­ing the king­dom into a decade of colour-coded con­flict. They were sup­pressed by the au­thor­i­ties af­ter the 2014 coup.</p>
    <p>Yet many of the stu­dents tak­ing part in the cur­rent protests hail from mid­dle-class back­grounds and some of Thai­land’s most elite in­sti­tu­tions. One high-school ac­tivist said some par­ents even tried to stop their chil­dren from par­tic­i­pat­ing fur­ther in protests by threat­en­ing to send them abroad to study.</p>
    <p>Satur­day’s pro­ceed­ings gave an idea of how the groups’ ideals dove­tailed. The young protest lead­ers named on stage peo­ple killed dur­ing the mil­i­tary’s crack­down on the 2010 red shirt protests, plac­ing their calls for ac­count­abil­ity within the larger arc of his­tory.</p>
    <p>“We should no longer look at this protest as merely a youth protest,” said Chu­la­longkorn Uni­ver­sity po­lit­i­cal sci­en­tist Pitch Pong­sawat. “This or­ganic con­nec­tion be­tween the red shirts and stu­dent groups has been sealed.”</p>
    <p>In­deed, Daeng’s call for the stu­dent protesters to re­turn was al­most unnecessar­y – thou­sands again joined the protest yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The move­ment’s grow­ing reach, cou­pled with in­creas­ingly stri­dent calls for monar­chy re­form, now puts Thai­land squarely in un­charted ter­ri­tory.</p>
