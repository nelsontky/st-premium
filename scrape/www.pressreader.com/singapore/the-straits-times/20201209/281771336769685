    <p>•</p>
    <p>SYDNEY Aus­tralia’s western state yes­ter­day be­gan to al­low trav­ellers from Vic­to­ria and New South Wales to en­ter with­out hav­ing to quar­an­tine for the first time in eight months, in the lat­est sign that the coun­try is re­turn­ing to some kind of nor­malcy.</p>
    <p>Pas­sen­gers on a Qan­tas flight ar­rived in Perth, the cap­i­tal of Western Aus­tralia, from Sydney to emo­tional scenes of fam­i­lies re­unit­ing after months of sep­a­ra­tion.</p>
    <p>The move comes as Aus­tralia’s two most pop­u­lous states have seen few to no new cases in re­cent weeks, and un­der­scores the coun­try’s suc­cess in con­tain­ing the pan­demic which has killed more than 1.5 mil­lion peo­ple world­wide.</p>
    <p>“We’re so happy,” Ms Tithi Kulka­rni told re­porters in Perth as she hugged her boyfriend Ruchira Jayasena, who had been in Sydney for the past six months.</p>
    <p>Peo­ple en­ter­ing Western Aus­tralia from Vic­to­ria and New South Wales will no longer be re­quired to quar­an­tine them­selves in a ho­tel for two weeks.</p>
    <p>Vic­to­ria has had no new cases for more than a month while New South Wales has recorded one lo­cal in­fec­tion in the last four weeks, state gov­ern­ment data shows.</p>
    <p>The eas­ing of re­stric­tions means that only peo­ple ar­riv­ing from South Aus­tralia, which re­ported 30 new Covid-19 cases late last month, will have to quar­an­tine upon ar­rival. Western Aus­tralia had al­ready re­sumed free travel with other states in re­cent weeks.</p>
    <p>State Premier Mark McGowan’s hard­line stance on its bor­ders has frus­trated fed­eral lead­ers and eastern state res­i­dents look­ing to re­turn home. But his ap­proach has proved widely pop­u­lar at home, where the econ­omy is roar­ing.</p>
    <p>Western Aus­tralia ac­counts for nearly all pro­duc­tion of Aus­tralia’s most valu­able ex­port – iron ore. In an­other sign of a strong lo­cal econ­omy, data last week showed Perth’s me­dian house price grew 2.4 per cent over the past 12 months, its big­gest an­nual gain since 2014.</p>
