    <p>Barcelona coach Ron­ald Koe­man cursed his side’s waste­ful­ness in front of goal af­ter they drew 1-1 at Alaves on Satur­day, drop­ping points for t he fourth game in a row in La Liga.</p>
    <p>Barca went be­hind be­fore the in­ter­val when Luis Rioja pounced on a dis­as­trous er­ror from goal­keeper Neto fol­low­ing a mix-up with de­fender Ger­ard Pique.</p>
    <p>The vis­i­tors had 25 shots at goal but man­aged to beat goal­keeper Fer­nando Pacheco only once, when An­toine Griez­mann net­ted early in the se­cond half al­most im­me­di­ately af­ter Jota had been sent off for the hosts.</p>
    <p>The per­for­mance was a let­down af­ter their mid­week Cham­pi­ons League 2-0 win at Ju­ven­tus had tem­po­rar­ily eased the pres­sure, spark­ing more ru­mours about Koe­man’s po­si­tion with Barca 12th in the ta­ble on eight points af­ter six games.</p>
    <p>The Dutch­man could barely hide his frus­tra­tion at re­cent re­sults, ap­pear­ing spiky as he dealt with ques­tions from re­porters about his de­ci­sions in the game and his touch­line de­meanour.</p>
    <p>He said: “I’m sur­prised I’m be­ing crit­i­cised for the im­age I gave on the touch­line. I think we did ev­ery­thing we could from the dugout and on the pitch.</p>
    <p>“In the last 10 min­utes, we played as we needed to play. If you crit­i­cise me for how I ap­pear on the touch­line, then we might as well give up.”</p>
    <p>But he con­ceded he had yet to sort out the team’s bal­ance, adding: “I’m wor­ried about our per­for­mance in at­tack. We don’t have a prob­lem with our at­ti­tude or con­cen­tra­tion, we just need to be more ef­fi­cient in front of goal.</p>
    <p>“If you cre­ate that many chances and only score once, it’s not good. Of course I’m wor­ried that we’ve only got two points from the last 12. I think over­all we played okay, I’d be more wor­ried if we weren’t cre­at­ing chances.</p>
    <p>“But we need to do bet­ter in front of goal, with the fi­nal pass, the fi­nal shot. We can­not af­ford to squan­der so many chances.”</p>
    <p>Koe­man’s mood was fur­ther soured af­ter see­ing La Liga cham­pi­ons and ri­vals Real Madrid go eight points clear of his side, al­beit hav­ing played a game more.</p>
    <p>Real clinched a 4-1 home win over Huesca that saw Eden Hazard, on his first start of the sea­son, score his first goal in over a year.</p>
