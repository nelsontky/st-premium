    <p>Rab­bit of­ten grinds teeth</p>
    <p>We have two Hol­land Lops, Cin­derella and Philip (right). Philip of­ten grinds his teeth when be­ing cud­dled. Is this some­thing we should be con­cerned about? Also, what are the im­por­tant den­tal is­sues we should be look­ing out for in bun­nies as they age? Pearly Cheong</p>
    <p>Rab­bits have evolved to have con­tin­u­ally grow­ing teeth as an adap­ta­tion to a diet of coarse fi­brous food that grad­u­ally pares down their teeth.</p>
    <p>They must be given a suit­able diet of ad li­bi­tum – or free flow – hay that is suit­able for their age group and con­di­tion, sup­ple­mented with a small amount of fresh leafy greens and com­mer­cially avail­able pel­lets.</p>
    <p>An im­proper diet may lead to den­tal is­sues which, in the long run, may lead to pain and a lack of ap­petite.</p>
    <p>Some bun­nies some­times show their en­joy­ment by grind­ing their teeth too, for ex­am­ple, if their own­ers are pet­ting them.</p>
    <p>How­ever, teeth grind­ing can also be an in­di­ca­tor of den­tal pain or dis­com­fort. When in pain, the rab­bit may adopt a more hunched po­si­tion and be less in­ter­ested in food or other ac­tiv­i­ties.</p>
    <p>It can be dif­fi­cult for pet own­ers to do a thor­ough den­tal ex­am­i­na­tion as there are cheek teeth that can be hard to see.</p>
    <p>Do ask your rab­bit’s reg­u­lar vet­eri­nar­ian to con­duct a check-up to rule out any den­tal is­sues and to dis­cuss a suit­able diet for it.</p>
    <p>Corgi is ag­gres­sive af­ter turn­ing one</p>
    <p>My sweet-na­tured corgi (left) be­came quite ag­gres­sive soon af­ter he turned one. Now, he barks in­ces­santly at reg­u­lar vis­i­tors or when the helper goes out. Dur­ing his walks, he will lunge at strangers. Be­sides train­ing, will neu­ter­ing help to re­duce his ag­gres­sion?</p>
    <p>Neu­ter­ing pets can re­duce the risk of them de­vel­op­ing cer­tain dis­eases, such as prostate dis­eases in male dogs. This may im­prove their health and longevity, and also re­duce the cost of com­plex vet­eri­nary pro­ce­dures in the fu­ture. It will also pre­vent un­wanted preg­nan­cies.</p>
    <p>The neu­ter­ing of male dogs may lead to be­havioural changes, but only if the be­hav­iour or ag­gres­sion has an un­der­ly­ing hor­monal cause – it will be re­moved once the pro­duc­tion of re­pro­duc­tive hor­mones is re­duced.</p>
    <p>Be­hav­iours that are learnt will un­likely change sig­nif­i­cantly. Hu­mane and sci­ence-based train­ing meth­ods should be em­ployed to mod­ify the un­de­sir­able as­pects of your pet’s be­hav­iour.</p>
