    <p>The Com­pre­hen­sive Agree­ment on In­vest­ment (CAI) signed be­tween China and the Euro­pean Union in the last days of 2020 – even as it was stiffly op­posed by the United States – can only be a global pub­lic good. Com­ing as this does in the wake of Novem­ber’s agree­ment on the Re­gional Com­pre­hen­sive Eco­nomic Part­ner­ship (RCEP), the CAI is an im­por­tant sig­nal that much of the world sees merit in keep­ing borders open to trade, in­vest­ment and peo­ple. Both the RCEP and CAI still have a ways to go – sev­eral months at least – be­fore they take ef­fect. How­ever, that does not de­tract from the strate­gic im­pli­ca­tions of the CAI deal or the diplo­matic tri­umph it rep­re­sents for China and Pres­i­dent Xi Jin­ping.</p>
    <p>Un­der the deal, Euro­pean firms can ex­pect to compete more equally with state-owned com­pa­nies in China, the EU’s sec­ond-largest trad­ing part­ner af­ter the US. It re­quires Beijing to rat­ify In­ter­na­tional Labour Or­gan­i­sa­tion rules ban­ning the use of forced labour, and al­low work­ers to form unions. It also has pro­vi­sions for set­tling dis­putes, re­quires greater dis­clo­sure of Chi­nese state sub­si­dies and re­stricts China’s prac­tice of de­mand­ing that for­eign in­vestors share their tech­nol­ogy. Some of these re­quire­ments are go­ing to be tricky for Beijing; in­de­pen­dent trade unions, for in­stance, are not easy to coun­te­nance at a time when the Chi­nese Com­mu­nist Party is gath­er­ing – not yield­ing – more power.</p>
    <p>The Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion in the US made its dis­plea­sure plain that the EU, which groups some of Amer­ica’s clos­est trans-At­lantic al­lies, had gone on to sign this crit­i­cal deal at a time when Wash­ing­ton has been lead­ing ef­forts to put a lid on Beijing’s geopo­lit­i­cal am­bi­tions through trade, diplo­matic and hu­man rights chan­nels. The out­go­ing US deputy na­tional se­cu­rity ad­viser said as much, pro­nounc­ing that he was “per­plexed and stunned” by the move. But Wash­ing­ton may be over­stat­ing its case. In many ways, the CAI merely helps the EU catch up with the US in the favourable terms of ac­cess that the US it­self ne­go­ti­ated with China, par­tic­u­larly in the prized arena of fi­nan­cial ser­vices.</p>
    <p>China is en­ti­tled to cel­e­brate the break­through. But it must know that against the back­drop of some in the West still hav­ing mis­giv­ings about the wis­dom of ad­mit­ting it into the World Trade Or­gan­i­sa­tion, it now needs to show good faith with the CAI and RCEP. There can be no greater strate­gic se­cu­rity for its peo­ple than the good­will of mil­lions of Euro­peans, Amer­i­cans and Asians who gain by fair and equal treat­ment within its mar­ket and see their des­tinies in­ter­twined with a rules-bound China. Mil­i­tary and na­tional se­cu­rity strate­gies once coined the acro­nym MAD – for mu­tu­ally as­sured de­struc­tion. As a new decade be­gins, ef­forts should be made to turn this to rep­re­sent mu­tu­ally ac­com­moda­tive de­vel­op­ment.</p>
