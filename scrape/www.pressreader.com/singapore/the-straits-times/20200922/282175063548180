    <p>Jack Ma’s Ant Group is seek­ing to raise at least US$35 bil­lion (S$47.5 bil­lion) in its ini­tial pub­lic of­fer­ing (IPO) af­ter as­sess­ing early-in­vestor in­ter­est, peo­ple fa­mil­iar with the mat­ter said, putting the Chi­nese fintech gi­ant on track for a record de­but sale.</p>
    <p>Ant lifted its IPO target based on an in­creased val­u­a­tion of about US$250 bil­lion, up from es­ti­mates of US$225 bil­lion, said the peo­ple, who asked not to be iden­ti­fied dis­cussing pri­vate mat­ters. It was ear­lier ex­pect­ing to raise at least US$30 bil­lion, peo­ple fa­mil­iar have said.</p>
    <p>Ant’s si­mul­ta­ne­ous list­ing i n Hong Kong and Shang­hai may mark the biggest IPO ever, top­ping Saudi Aramco’s record US$29 bil­lion sale. Ant could ex­ceed Bank of Amer­ica Corp’s market cap­i­tal­i­sa­tion, and be more than twice the size of Cit­i­group. Among US banks, only JPMor­gan Chase & Co is big­ger at US$300 bil­lion.</p>
    <p>The com­pany re­ceived a nod from reg­u­la­tors in Shang­hai on Fri­day to pro­ceed with its pub­lic share sale. In the wake of its IPO plans, it has been hit by a flurry of new reg­u­la­tions aimed at re­duc­ing risks in</p>
    <p>China’s on­line fi­nance sec­tor. Reg­u­la­tors have curbed small-loan funding sources, capped lend­ing rates and im­posed new cap­i­tal and licence re­quire­ments on Ant and other con­glom­er­ates.</p>
    <p>The Hangzhou-based com­pany is seek­ing a hear­ing with the Hong Kong stock ex­change on Thurs­day to clear the next key hur­dle, the peo­ple said. Ant de­clined to com­ment in an e-mailed state­ment.</p>
    <p>The com­pany has picked China In­ter­na­tional Cap­i­tal Corp, Cit­i­group, JPMor­gan and Mor­gan Stan­ley for its Hong Kong sale.</p>
    <p>Ant, which grew out of the Ali­pay pay­ments app, now gets the bulk of its rev­enue from pro­vid­ing quick con­sumer loans, fu­elling China’s grow­ing con­sumer spend­ing. It also runs an in­sur­ance busi­ness and money market funds, on top of pro­vid­ing credit scor­ing and tech­no­log­i­cal ser­vices for the fi­nance sec­tor.</p>
    <p>Ali­pay has 711 mil­lion ac­tive users, mostly in China, who tap it to buy ev­ery­thing from a quick cof­fee to even prop­erty, gen­er­at­ing US$17 tril­lion in pay­ments in the 12 months through June. For those who don’t have ready cash to spend via Ali­pay, Ant op­er­ates ser­vices that dole out small un­se­cured loans: Huabei (Just Spend) and Jiebei (Just Lend). The for­mer fo­cuses on quick con­sumer loans for pur­chases of iPhones and fridges, while the lat­ter finances any­thing from travel to ed­u­ca­tion.</p>
    <p>Ant uses some of its cap­i­tal for loans, but the bulk of the money comes from banks, with the firm act­ing as a gate­way. The plat­forms made loans to 500 mil­lion peo­ple in the 12 months through June, charg­ing an­nu­alised rates on smaller loans of about 15 per cent.</p>
