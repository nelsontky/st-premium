    <p>SHANG­HAI • Hong Kong film di­rec­tor Wong Kar Wai is ex­pected to de­light fans once more, this time with his first foray into tele­vi­sion, movie trade mag­a­zine Va­ri­ety re­ported.</p>
    <p>The 62-year-old, known for his richly sat­u­rated sets and at­mo­spheric sound­scapes, is set to pro­duce as well as di­rect the pi­lot episode of Blos­soms Shang­hai, which will star ac­tor Hu Ge, a Shang­hai na­tive.</p>
    <p>The show is a tele­vi­sion adap­tion of the 2012 novel Blos­soms by Chi­nese nov­el­ist Jin Yucheng. The book, a rare ex­am­ple of a novel writ­ten in Shang­hainese, has won mul­ti­ple awards, in­clud­ing the pres­ti­gious Mao Dun Lit­er­ary Prize in 2015.</p>
    <p>Work­ing along­side Wong is a team of es­tab­lished creatives, in­clud­ing award-win­ning Shang­hainese screen­writer Qin Wen, as well as Academy Award­win­ning cin­e­matog­ra­pher Peter Pau, known for his work in Crouch­ing Tiger, Hid­den Dragon (2000).</p>
    <p>Hu, who is known for his work in pe­riod drama Nir­vana In Fire (2015) and The Wild Goose Lake (2019), an art­house movie, will play the se­ries’ main char­ac­ter – a young op­por­tunist with a trou­bled his­tory. Set against a pe­riod of eco­nomic ex­pan­sion and growth in 1990s Shang­hai, the se­ries fol­lows Hu’s char­ac­ter in his pur­suit of wealth and glam­our.</p>
    <p>Blos­soms Shang­hai is, in a way, a home­com­ing for Wong. Although the di­rec­tor of art­house favourites such as Chungk­ing Ex­press (1994) is of­ten as­so­ci­ated with the Hong Kong film in­dus­try, Wong was born in Shang­hai.</p>
    <p>In a state­ment, he said: “Jin Yucheng’s land­mark novel Blos­soms has been the per­fect back­drop to visu­alise and share my love for my birth city.”</p>
    <p>“With the se­ries,” the di­rec­tor added, “I would like to in­vite the au­di­ence to im­merse in the in­trigues of Shang­hai and its in­hab­i­tants in the early 1990s, an ex­cit­ing time that paved the way for the pros­per­ity of mod­ern Shang­hai.”</p>
