    <p>Learn­ing to read and write may be cru­cial, but other life skills are just as im­por­tant for chil­dren en­ter­ing Pri­mary 1, ex­perts say.</p>
    <p>So­cial skills, flex­i­ble think­ing and self-con­trol are some of the at­tributes they should pick up by the end of kin­der­garten.</p>
    <p>A Min­istry of Ed­u­ca­tion (MOE) spokesman says the Pri­mary 1 cur­ricu­lum is de­signed to meet the learn­ing needs of all chil­dren, re­gard­less of their back­ground or the pre-schools they come from.</p>
    <p>“Chil­dren are not ex­pected to know the spell­ing of spe­cific words or solve math­e­mat­i­cal prob­lems be­fore en­ter­ing Pri­mary 1,” she adds.</p>
    <p>“In­stead, it is more im­por­tant for pre-school chil­dren to de­velop self-con­fi­dence, so­cial skills and a pos­i­tive at­ti­tude to­wards learn­ing.”</p>
    <p>The MOE’s Nur­tur­ing Early Learn­ers frame­work helps preschool ed­u­ca­tors un­der­stand how chil­dren at the ages of four to six learn best.</p>
    <p>This “pro­vides clar­ity on what chil­dren are ex­pected to know and be able to do by the end of Kin­der­garten 2, and is aligned with the ex­pec­ta­tions of chil­dren at the be­gin­ning of Pri­mary 1, to bet­ter fa­cil­i­tate their tran­si­tion into pri­mary school,” says the MOE spokesman.</p>
    <p>The guide out­lines six key learn­ing ar­eas: aes­thet­ics and creative ex­pres­sion, dis­cov­ery of the world, lan­guage and lit­er­acy, mo­tor skills de­vel­op­ment, nu­mer­acy, and so­cial and emo­tional de­vel­op­ment.</p>
    <p>The MOE says it will con­tinue to work with pri­mary schools on ap­pro­pri­ate teach­ing and learn­ing prac­tices to meet the needs of in­com­ing Pri­mary 1 pupils and their dif­fer­ent start­ing points.</p>
    <p>It also works with the Early Child­hood De­vel­op­ment Agency to help pre-school ed­u­ca­tors bet­ter un­der­stand how they can lay the foun­da­tion for learn­ing in pri­mary school. This in­cludes shar­ing pri­mary school cur­ricu­lum developmen­ts with pre-schools.</p>
    <p>Dr Jac­que­line Chung, aca­demic direc­tor of St James’ Preschool Ser­vices, which man­ages St James’ Church Kin­der­garten and Lit­tle Seeds Preschool, says that prepa­ra­tion for Pri­mary 1 goes be­yond aca­demic skills.</p>
    <p>“Rather than just how to count, write and spell, chil­dren need to know why nu­mer­acy, writ­ing and spell­ing are im­por­tant, and the part these play in their daily lives,” she adds.</p>
    <p>For in­stance, chil­dren at her cen­tres learn nu­mer­acy through prac­ti­cal ex­pe­ri­ences and role-play, rather than through rote learn­ing.</p>
    <p>School readi­ness also in­cludes a pos­i­tive at­ti­tude to learn­ing and foun­da­tions needed for build­ing knowl­edge, says Dr Chung.</p>
    <p>Schools and fam­i­lies should ad­just to chil­dren’s dif­fer­ent learn­ing ap­petites and avoid force­feed­ing or un­der­feed­ing them.</p>
    <p>Ms Jean Koh, as­sis­tant direc­tor of Cir­cle of Care, a pro­gramme to help young chil­dren from low­in­come fam­i­lies, says there are seven key life skills that make up ex­ec­u­tive func­tion, which refers to men­tal at­tributes that are needed for ev­ery­day life.</p>
    <p>These broadly cover work­ing mem­ory, flex­i­ble think­ing and self-con­trol. The first four skills are fo­cus and self-con­trol, per­spec­tive-tak­ing, com­mu­ni­ca­tion and mak­ing con­nec­tions. The other three are crit­i­cal think­ing, tak­ing on chal­lenges and self­di­rected learn­ing.</p>
    <p>Ms Koh says these skills are crit­i­cal for tran­si­tion be­cause the ex­pec­ta­tions on chil­dren in­crease when they en­ter pri­mary school.</p>
    <p>The skills help chil­dren to nav­i­gate not just a new en­vi­ron­ment, but also re­la­tion­ships around them, en­abling them to ex­cel in school and in life. They also help them to build strong aca­demic foun­da­tions, for in­stance, in mak­ing con­nec­tions and ex­er­cis­ing self-con­trol, says Ms Koh.</p>
    <p>Chil­dren are not ex­pected to know the spell­ing of spe­cific words or solve math­e­mat­i­cal prob­lems be­fore en­ter­ing Pri­mary 1.</p>
    <p>In­stead, it is more im­por­tant for pre-school chil­dren to de­velop self-con­fi­dence, so­cial skills and a pos­i­tive at­ti­tude to­wards learn­ing.</p>
