    <p>My 14-year-old hor­mones are just knock­ing on the door right now. I was in high school and my girl­friends and I would lis­ten to Pur­ple Rain all the time.</p>
    <p>I re­mem­ber go­ing on a drive with my par­ents. I begged them to put the Prince cas­sette on in the car and when it got to Dar­ling Nikki, I re­mem­ber it didn’t sit well with my dad.</p>
    <p>Then, cut to 1992 when Prince (above) did a con­cert at Earl’s Court in Lon­don. I was in­vited back­stage af­ter­wards and I got to meet him.</p>
    <p>I don’t know where I had the gump­tion or guts to say or how I even said it, but some­thing like: “I’m work­ing on a new al­bum and won­der if you would ever want to work to­gether.”</p>
    <p>His driver came over and de­liv­ered a cas­sette with Prince singing this song called Baby­doll, which was an adap­ta­tion of the lyrics that I sent him. It was one of those home-alone mo­ments where you just want to scream and jump and hug some­one.</p>
    <p>I went to Minneapoli­s, hung out for a few days and that was that. I re­mem­ber be­ing in his car and we just went for a spin. We never got to make mu­sic to­gether.</p>
