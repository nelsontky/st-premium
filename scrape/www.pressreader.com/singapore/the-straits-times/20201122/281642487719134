    <p>Trav­ellers who were sched­uled to take the in­au­gu­ral flight to­day be­tween Sin­ga­pore and Hong Kong un­der the air travel bub­ble ar­range­ment were dis­ap­pointed af­ter it was de­ferred yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Among them was Mr Aaron Wong, 32, who founded fre­quent flier web­site MileLion.</p>
    <p>He said he was go­ing to check out the travel bub­ble ar­range­ments, spend three nights in Hong Kong and re­view the ex­pe­ri­ence. He booked three sep­a­rate ho­tels for the pur­pose.</p>
    <p>Mr Wong, whose most re­cent trip was to Kuala Lumpur in Fe­bru­ary, said: “I love fly­ing. I (tried the</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore Air­lines din­ing ex­pe­ri­ences and tour) but noth­ing beats the real thing, and the travel bub­ble was sup­posed to be that.”</p>
    <p>Fel­low trav­eller Hen­dric Tay, 33, founder of travel blog The Travel In­tern, was also due to fly to Hong Kong to­day.</p>
    <p>His 24-day trip was meant to be an ex­pe­ri­ence of the travel bub­ble and to find out the ground sit­u­a­tion in the city and write about it for his blog.</p>
    <p>He also planned to meet friends based in the territory.</p>
    <p>He said yes­ter­day: “I’m dis­ap­pointed, es­pe­cially so be­cause in the last cou­ple of days, I had the feel­ing it might be can­celled. This morn­ing, (there was news) that it was not go­ing to be can­celled.</p>
    <p>“But around 5pm, they an­nounced that it was go­ing to be post­poned, so it was like a roller coaster of emo­tions.</p>
    <p>Mr Alvin Liu, 41, who is based in Hong Kong, re­turned here in late Septem­ber af­ter his mother was hos­pi­talised.</p>
    <p>He was due to re­turn to the territory, where his fam­ily lives, on Nov 30. That will now have to wait for an­other two weeks.</p>
    <p>Mr Liu, who works in a bank, be­lieves it may be tough to se­cure a seat then. This is be­cause many trav­ellers who have had their plans de­ferred, like him, would also be scram­bling to se­cure a flight.</p>
