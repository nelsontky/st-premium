    <p>A team of doc­tors and re­searchers in Sin­ga­pore has started a car­diac re­search pro­gramme to bet­ter un­der­stand why some pa­tients who are hit hard by Covid-19 also suf­fer heart dam­age, and how to pre­vent it. The Na­tional Univer­sity Heart Cen­tre, Sin­ga­pore team aims to re­cruit 100 Covid-19 pa­tients.</p>
    <p>A team of doc­tors and re­searchers in Sin­ga­pore has started a car­diac re­search pro­gramme to bet­ter un­der­stand why some pa­tients who are hit hard by Covid-19 also suf­fer heart dam­age, and how to pre­vent this from hap­pen­ing.</p>
    <p>The Na­tional Univer­sity Heart Cen­tre, Sin­ga­pore (NUHCS) team aims to re­cruit 100 Covid-19 pa­tients as mount­ing ev­i­dence over­seas sug­gests that some pa­tients con­tinue to suf­fer long-term com­pli­ca­tions even af­ter re­cov­ery.</p>
    <p>Though se­ri­ous com­pli­ca­tions re­lated to the heart af­ter re­cov­ery here are not com­mon, doc­tors say they are mon­i­tor­ing the sit­u­a­tion closely.</p>
    <p>Pro­fes­sor Tan Huay Cheem, di­rec­tor and se­nior con­sul­tant at NUHCS, said Covid-19 should be viewed as im­pact­ing the en­tire vas­cu­lar sys­tem, in­clud­ing the heart, lungs, kid­neys, liver and brain, and not just a spe­cific or­gan sys­tem.</p>
    <p>“Sort­ing out the long-last­ing symp­tom of lethargy or breath­less­ness will en­tail as­sess­ment of lung, heart and other or­gan func­tions at the same time,” said Prof Tan.</p>
    <p>The pro­gramme by the Car­dio­vas­cu­lar Re­search In­sti­tute within NUHCS in­cludes a clin­i­cal study us­ing known pro­tein biomark­ers to iden­tify pa­tients at risk of de­vel­op­ing se­ri­ous car­dio­vas­cu­lar com­pli­ca­tions af­ter they re­cover from the virus.</p>
    <p>There is ev­i­dence glob­ally to show that some pa­tients con­tinue to suf­fer long-term com­pli­ca­tions.</p>
    <p>For in­stance, a re­cent Jama Car­di­ol­ogy study of 100 re­cently re­cov­ered Covid-19 pa­tients in Ger­many found that three quar­ters of them suf­fered from heart in­flam­ma­tion.</p>
    <p>The char­ac­ter­is­tics are im­paired abil­ity of the heart to con­tract, scar for­ma­tion and en­large­ment of the heart.</p>
    <p>The study, pub­lished l ate l ast month, noted the pos­si­bil­ity of fu­ture heart fail­ure as a re­sult of the pa­tients’ con­di­tion. Call­ing the Ger­man study sig­nif­i­cant and alarm­ing, Prof Tan said car­dio­vas­cu­lar mag­netic res­o­nance imag­ing – which was used in the Ger­man study – is the most ac­cu­rate tool in eval­u­at­ing heart func­tion and health.</p>
    <p>Dr Shawn Va­soo, clin­i­cal di­rec­tor of the Na­tional Cen­tre for In­fec­tious Dis­eases (NCID), said the im­pact on or­gans out­side the lungs can be de­tected only through fur­ther di­ag­nos­tic test­ing such as car­diac imag­ing and lab­o­ra­tory test­ing.</p>
    <p>He stressed the im­por­tance of de­vel­op­ing ways to de­ter­mine which pa­tient would re­quire these fur­ther tests. “This will then help us to de­velop di­rected treat­ment and preven­tion strate­gies for such com­pli­ca­tions,” he added.</p>
    <p>At NCID, fol­low-up pro­ce­dures with pa­tients take place on three fronts. First, pa­tients who had a more se­ri­ous course of Covid-19 – such as se­vere pneu­mo­nia with resid­ual res­pi­ra­tory prob­lems, car­diac in­flam­ma­tion or in­jury, or a clot­ting dis­or­der – are seen by the cor­re­spond­ing med­i­cal spe­cial­ists.</p>
    <p>For pa­tients who suf­fered only a mild course of Covid-19 and have no ap­par­ent com­pli­ca­tions, they are re­minded to seek med­i­cal at­ten­tion should any new and per­sis­tent symp­toms de­velop, such as short­ness of breath and chest pain.</p>
    <p>Fi­nally, pa­tients who are el­i­gi­ble and will­ing are also given the op­por­tu­nity to en­rol in a re­search study which aims to track pa­tients for up to two years.</p>
    <p>The Ger­man study is not the only one throw­ing up such find­ings.</p>
    <p>A global study of 1,216 pa­tients from 69 coun­tries across six con­ti­nents, which used tra­di­tional ul­tra­sound imag­ing to study the heart, showed that 55 per cent of Covid-19 pa­tients had ab­nor­mal heart find­ings, Prof Tan said. It was pub­lished in the Euro­pean Heart Jour­nal – Car­dio­vas­cu­lar Imag­ing in June.</p>
    <p>The as­so­ci­a­tion be­tween Covid-19 and heart in­flam­ma­tion is un­clear, Prof Tan said.</p>
    <p>Heart in­flam­ma­tion may not be di­rectly due to vi­ral in­va­sion but caused in­stead by an im­paired and over­ac­tive im­mune re­sponse from the body, he added.</p>
    <p>The ef­fects on other vi­tal or­gans, like the brain, or clot­ting ab­nor­mal­i­ties may be equally life-threat­en­ing.</p>
    <p>While most pa­tients have re­cov­ered un­event­fully, there are some who have clin­i­cally ap­par­ent com­pli­ca­tions, and oth­ers in which such com­pli­ca­tions are not ob­vi­ous, Dr Va­soo said.</p>
    <p>He added: “Work is on­go­ing to un­der­stand bet­ter who is at risk, and to de­tect these ear­lier – and this will pave the way for pre-emp­tive mon­i­tor­ing and our ther­a­peu­tic ap­proaches.”</p>
    <p>The pro­gramme by the Car­dio­vas­cu­lar Re­search In­sti­tute within NUHCS in­cludes a clin­i­cal study us­ing known pro­tein biomark­ers to iden­tify pa­tients at risk of de­vel­op­ing se­ri­ous car­dio­vas­cu­lar com­pli­ca­tions af­ter they re­cover from the virus.</p>
