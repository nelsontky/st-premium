    <p>There has been a sharp rise in the num­ber of re­ports of near misses, un­safe prac­tices and haz­ards in the Sin­ga­pore Armed Forces (SAF), but that is a good sign as it in­di­cates a greater like­li­hood of bet­ter safety out­comes, said a top of­fi­cial who re­views safety in the mil­i­tary.</p>
    <p>Be­tween 2018 and last year, the num­ber of these re­ports went up by 49 per cent, said the Min­istry of De­fence yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>These re­ports, which num­ber in the thou­sands, were made through such av­enues as a safety hot­line, ap­pointed safety ad­vo­cates in units and through the chain of com­mand to su­pe­ri­ors.</p>
    <p>Mr Heng Chi­ang Gnee, chair­man of the sec­ond Ex­ter­nal Re­view Panel on SAF Safety (ERPSS), told re­porters at a mil­i­tary event yes­ter­day: “I have seen the statis­tics, an in­crease year on year of 49 per cent is re­ally good. So these are to me lead­ing in­di­ca­tors.”</p>
    <p>Such in­di­ca­tors could be ac­tions or pro­grammes that ought to be done, and mon­i­tored on the fre­quency with which they are tak­ing place, he said, adding that they are an al­ter­na­tive to look­ing at safety out­comes alone.</p>
    <p>“For such in­di­ca­tors, the more you do it, the greater like­li­hood of a bet­ter out­come. So these are things that we have tried to get the SAF to push more.”</p>
    <p>Bet­ter open re­port­ing av­enues were among the rec­om­men­da­tions of the first ERPSS, formed in 2013 to val­i­date safety prac­tices in the SAF and to de­ter­mine if they match up with best prac­tices of in­dus­tries and other armed forces.</p>
    <p>Mr Heng, a non-ex­ec­u­tive di­rec­tor at oil and gas com­pany MMA Off­shore with long ex­pe­ri­ence in the field of health and safety, was also a mem­ber of the first ERPSS. “We found then that more could be done in that area. So the SAF has taken it on board, and has pushed that with very good out­comes.”</p>
    <p>He was speak­ing to re­porters dur­ing a visit to the Is­land De­fence Train­ing In­sti­tute in Cle­menti Camp to ob­serve op­er­a­tionally ready na­tional ser­vice­men (NS­men) train­ing for home­land se­cu­rity op­er­a­tions.</p>
    <p>Train­ing safety in the SAF came un­der the spot­light last year, when NS­man and ac­tor Aloy­sius Pang died af­ter be­ing in­jured while on a live fir­ing ex­er­cise in New Zealand.</p>
    <p>The mea­sures taken since to boost safety in­clude set­ting up the high-level In­spec­tor-Gen­eral’s Of­fice in Fe­bru­ary last year to scru­ti­nise safety prac­tices at all lev­els.</p>
    <p>The of­fice taps the ex­per­tise of ex­ter­nal safety pro­fes­sion­als, like those on the panel Mr Heng heads.</p>
    <p>He de­scribed health and safety man­age­ment as “a move­ment and a jour­ney”, in which the more gaps are iden­ti­fied, the more likely im­prove­ments can be made faster.</p>
    <p>He said that from his ob­ser­va­tions, the fun­da­men­tals are in place, in terms of own­er­ship of this is­sue at the top level.</p>
    <p>“The chal­lenge for the army is to see how best they can bring that own­er­ship right down to the last man,” he said, adding that a lot of ef­fort has been put in over the last three years.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day’s visit is the ninth the panel has made to SAF units and ex­er­cises since it was con­vened in 2017. Among its roles is to as­sess the SAF’s safety man­age­ment sys­tems and give feed­back on best prac­tices from the civil­ian sec­tor.</p>
    <p>The third ERPSS will be con­vened in Jan­uary.</p>
    <p>Asked for her views, panel mem­ber Kala Anan­dara­jah said she now has deep in­sight into how se­ri­ously the army takes safety.</p>
    <p>“What strikes me is that this is not an un­safe place. This is not go­ing to be a risky en­vi­ron­ment that we send our sons to.”</p>
