    <p>The Law Min­istry (MinLaw) will en­sure Sin­ga­pore’s in­fra­struc­ture and fa­cil­i­ties for dis­pute res­o­lu­tion re­main state of the art and user-cen­tric, as it con­tin­ues to work closely with the in­dus­try com­mu­nity to strengthen Sin­ga­pore as a hub.</p>
    <p>A MinLaw spokesman said the coun­try’s dis­pute res­o­lu­tion in­sti­tu­tions have re­sponded swiftly to the Covid-19 pan­demic, and have adopted and en­hanced tech­nol­ogy so­lu­tions to adapt to the evolv­ing sit­u­a­tion.</p>
    <p>“Sin­ga­pore will con­tinue to work with our part­ners to en­hance user ex­pe­ri­ence through tech­no­log­i­cal in­no­va­tion and sup­port the con­ti­nu­ity of busi­ness ac­tiv­i­ties as much as pos­si­ble, as we move into a new nor­mal,” MinLaw told The Straits Times last week.</p>
    <p>The spokesman noted that the Sin­ga­pore In­ter­na­tional Ar­bi­tra­tion Cen­tre (SIAC) and Sin­ga­pore In­ter­na­tional Me­di­a­tion Cen­tre have made pro­vi­sion for on­line ar­bi­tra­tions and me­di­a­tions, should par­ties re­quire them.</p>
    <p>“SIAC has also re­sponded quickly to the chal­lenges brought about by Covid-19 by re­leas­ing SIAC Guides, a se­ries of user-friendly tools to as­sist SIAC users.”</p>
    <p>MinLaw added that Maxwell Cham­bers is proac­tively col­lab­o­rat­ing with part­ners to of­fer par­ties in­te­grated and seam­less vir­tual dis­pute res­o­lu­tion hear­ing ser­vices in place of phys­i­cal ones.</p>
    <p>Maxwell Cham­bers has also ex­panded its net­work of hear­ing cen­tres across the globe to fa­cil­i­tate re­li­able e-hear­ings or semi-vir­tual hear­ings for in­ter­na­tional par­ties.</p>
    <p>Other moves to keep Sin­ga­pore as a lead­ing global hub in­clude reg­u­lar re­views of the state’s le­gal frame­work for ar­bi­tra­tion to keep pace with in­ter­na­tional de­vel­op­ments and meet user needs.</p>
    <p>On Oct 5, Par­lia­ment passed amend­ments to the In­ter­na­tional Ar­bi­tra­tion Act to strengthen Sin­ga­pore’s in­ter­na­tional ar­bi­tra­tion frame­work.</p>
    <p>The amend­ments were made af­ter ex­ten­sive con­sul­ta­tion with the dis­pute res­o­lu­tion com­mu­nity and busi­nesses.</p>
    <p>MinLaw con­tin­ues to work closely with the com­mu­nity to strengthen Sin­ga­pore’s dis­pute res­o­lu­tion hub, both at the na­tional and in­sti­tu­tional lev­els.</p>
    <p>Speak­ing in Par­lia­ment on Oct 5, Sec­ond Min­is­ter for Law Ed­win Tong said: “Today, Sin­ga­pore is a pop­u­lar seat for ar­bi­tra­tion, and also recog­nised as the third most pre­ferred in in­ter­na­tional ar­bi­tra­tion in the world.</p>
    <p>“It is also the third most pre­ferred ar­bi­tral in­sti­tu­tion – the SIAC – glob­ally.”</p>
    <p>“We will aim to do even bet­ter in the com­ing years,” he added, stress­ing that this growth is based on the com­mon un­der­stand­ing and close part­ner­ship be­tween the Gov­ern­ment and the en­tire le­gal fra­ter­nity.</p>
    <p>“At the same time, the ar­bi­tra­tion land­scape is con­stantly evolv­ing.</p>
    <p>“We must be ever alert to chang­ing needs, and con­tinue to im­prove Sin­ga­pore’s value propo­si­tions as a hub for in­ter­na­tional com­mer­cial ar­bi­tra­tion.”</p>
