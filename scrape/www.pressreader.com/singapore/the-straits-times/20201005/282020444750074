    <p>Cou­ples will soon be able to file their di­vorce pa­pers on­line on a new Web por­tal.</p>
    <p>Ten­ta­tively called Lit­i­ga­tion As­sist, though its name has not been fi­nalised, the por­tal will gen­er­ate court doc­u­ments re­lat­ing to un­con­tested divorces and al­low them to be filed.</p>
    <p>This sim­pli­fied track is for spouses who are not con­test­ing the di­vorce and who have agreed on all an­cil­lary mat­ters, such as child cus­tody and main­te­nance.</p>
    <p>The por­tal, which will be up and run­ning around the end of this year, will ease the ad­min­is­tra­tive process of fil­ing for a di­vorce, es­pe­cially for spouses with­out a lawyer.</p>
    <p>A Fam­ily Justice Courts (FJC) spokesman told The Straits Times: “The cur­rent process is labour-in­ten­sive, re­quir­ing court users to man­u­ally com­plete the nec­es­sary court forms and sup­port­ing doc­u­ments.”</p>
    <p>Spouses who have no lawyer have to go in per­son to a Ser­vice Bureau, ei­ther at the Supreme Court or Chi­na­town Point, to file their case.</p>
    <p>If a lawyer is hired, he will usu­ally file the di­vorce doc­u­ments for his client.</p>
    <p>Chief Justice Sun­daresh Menon an­nounced the new por­tal dur­ing the Law So­ci­ety Fam­ily Con­fer­ence last month.</p>
    <p>The FJC spokesman said the por­tal will guide users to ob­tain the rel­e­vant per­sonal in­for­ma­tion from MyInfo to com­plete the court forms on­line. MyInfo is a gov­ern­ment ser­vice that al­lows users to man­age their per­sonal data for on­line trans­ac­tions.</p>
    <p>Go­ing on­line will re­move the need for the per­son to file the di­vorce pa­pers at the Ser­vice Bureau.</p>
    <p>The new por­tal will also as­sist lawyers by al­low­ing them to fol­low up with the fil­ing process and pro­vide ad­vice af­ter their clients have filled in their ba­sic in­for­ma­tion.</p>
    <p>Af­ter both par­ties have seen the ap­pli­ca­tion and con­sent to the di­vorce pro­ceed­ing on the sim­pli­fied track, the case will be filed in court.</p>
    <p>The FJC spokesman added that cases on the sim­pli­fied track gen­er­ally do not re­quire the par­ties or their lawyers to at­tend court hear­ings, un­less oth­er­wise di­rected.</p>
    <p>Some fam­ily lawyers told The Straits Times they were ini­tially con­cerned that the new por­tal min­imises their role in act­ing for cou­ples go­ing through an un­con­tested di­vorce.</p>
    <p>As lawyer Glo­ria James-Civetta pointed out, lawyers spend a con­sid­er­able amount of time and ef­fort in ne­go­ti­a­tions to help many cou­ples agree to an un­con­tested di­vorce in the first place.</p>
    <p>The FJC spokesman ac­knowl­edged the con­cern, not­ing that fam­ily lawyers con­tinue to play a “crit­i­cal role” in fam­ily dis­putes, and they are still re­quired to pro­vide le­gal ad­vice on di­vorce-re­lated is­sues as the new por­tal will not be able to do this.</p>
    <p>Users will also be reg­u­larly prompted to seek le­gal ad­vice at var­i­ous stages of us­ing the on­line ser­vice if they have trou­ble com­plet­ing the nec­es­sary in­for­ma­tion re­quired or if they are un­aware of the im­pli­ca­tions of their choices, said the FJC spokesman.</p>
    <p>They will also get re­fer­ral codes that can be for­warded to their lawyers who can then as­sist them with the process.</p>
    <p>The FJC spokesman added: “Lit­i­ga­tion As­sist min­imises ad­min­is­tra­tive er­rors and al­lows fam­ily lawyers more time to fo­cus on pro­vid­ing le­gal ad­vice on di­vorce-re­lated is­sues.”</p>
    <p>Lawyer Ivan Cheong said the new por­tal may be use­ful for cou­ples who al­ready know what they want in an un­con­tested di­vorce with few or no an­cil­lary mat­ters that re­quire le­gal ad­vice.</p>
    <p>These could in­clude cou­ples in short, child­less mar­riages who are not seek­ing to di­vide the mat­ri­mo­nial as­sets and there is no claim for main­te­nance.</p>
    <p>He said: “In such cases, the semi-au­to­ma­tion of the process and the abil­ity to have the di­vorce pa­pers filled and filed with min­i­mal in­con­ve­nience would as­sist. They would also, of course, save on le­gal fees.”</p>
    <p>Mr Leonard Lee, ex­ec­u­tive di­rec­tor of the Com­mu­nity Justice Cen­tre, feels the new por­tal is not a one-size-fits-all tool for all un­con­tested divorces and he ad­vises cou­ples to seek le­gal ad­vice if they are uncer­tain about their rights and obli­ga­tions.</p>
    <p>Lawyers also stressed the im­por­tance of seek­ing le­gal ad­vice, as de­ci­sions re­lat­ing to a di­vorce have crit­i­cal and long-last­ing im­pli­ca­tions for cou­ples and their chil­dren.</p>
