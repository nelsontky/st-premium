    <p>WASH­ING­TON Ally McDon­ald, chas­ing her first LPGA ti­tle, is seek­ing the per­fect birth­day present as she reeled off five con­sec­u­tive birdies to grab a one-stroke lead af­ter the sec­ond round of the Drive On Cham­pi­onship on Fri­day.</p>
    <p>The Amer­i­can, who turns 28 to­day, fired a four-un­der 68 to stand on 10-un­der 134 af­ter 36 holes at Reynolds Lake Oconee in Greens­boro, Ge­or­gia.</p>
    <p>That was good enough for a on­e­stroke lead over fifth-ranked com­pa­triot Danielle Kang (70) and Filipino stand­out Bianca Pag­dan­ganan (67) with Thai­land’s Ariya Ju­tanu­garn (69) an­other shot adrift.</p>
    <p>“Feel re­ally good,” McDon­ald said. “I put my­self in a great po­si­tion to hit some re­ally good shots and it was re­ally solid.”</p>
    <p>The tour­na­ment was cre­ated to fill a gap be­tween US events af­ter the LPGA’s usual Asian swing was wiped out by the coro­n­avirus pandemic. While no spec­ta­tors were al­lowed on the course due to Covid-19 safety is­sues, a lake­side back nine al­lowed view­ers aboard more than 20 boats to watch the ac­tion.</p>
    <p>World No. 62 McDon­ald’s best LPGA re­sults have been a pair of third-place fin­ishes, most re­cently at last year’s Sho­pRite Clas­sic.</p>
    <p>“It’s re­ally easy as a per­son who has never won to get ahead of your­self,” she said. “We all re­ally want to win. That’s why we do this, that’s why we com­pete, to put our­self in con­tention as much as we can.</p>
    <p>“The next two days I’m just go­ing to try to ex­e­cute my game plan, stick to one shot at a time. If I find my­self get­ting ahead, I need to back off, and be right in the mo­ment, and try to ex­e­cute the shot I have.”</p>
    <p>That is even tougher with her par­ents at the re­sort, bring­ing a birth­day cake to cel­e­brate to­day that would taste sweeter if she gets her break­through vic­tory. “It would be pretty spe­cial. It would be a great birth­day present,” she said.</p>
    <p>McDon­ald, who started on the back nine, birdied the par-four 11th then ran off five birdies in a row start­ing at the par-three 17th. Af­ter</p>
    <p>reach­ing 12 un­der with six holes re­main­ing, she had bo­geys at the par­four fifth and par-five sixth be­fore three pars to reach the clubhouse.</p>
    <p>Pag­dan­ganan birdied three of the first six holes, took her only bo­gey at the par-three eighth, then birdied the 11th and par-five 12th and closed with an­other birdie to shoot 67 with a birdie sweep of four par-five holes.</p>
    <p>Kang, who won the LPGA’s first two Covid-19 re­turn events in Au­gust, got up and down for birdie at No. 18 to shoot 70. Amer­i­can Jen­nifer Song, who shared the 18-hole lead with Kang on 65, stum­bled back with a 75 on Fri­day.</p>
