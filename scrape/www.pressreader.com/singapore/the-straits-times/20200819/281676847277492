    <p>About 100 mi­grant work­ers in dor­mi­to­ries pre­vi­ously cleared of the virus have tested pos­i­tive for Covid-19 dur­ing rou­tine bi­weekly test­ing.</p>
    <p>The Min­istry of Man­power and the Min­istry of Health said yes­ter­day that the ros­tered rou­tine test­ing is for mi­grant work­ers stay­ing in dor­mi­to­ries, those work­ing on con­struc­tion or pro­duc­tion sites, and those in the con­struc­tion, marine and process sec­tors.</p>
    <p>Over 100,000 mi­grant work­ers have be­gun the rou­tine test­ing, done every two weeks.</p>
    <p>Of the in­fec­tions found in dor­mi­to­ries pre­vi­ously free of cases, the min­istries said: “Some of these work­ers have re­sumed work­ing.</p>
    <p>“We have taken timely ac­tions to con­tain and iso­late the Covid-19 pos­i­tive cases. We have also taken ag­gres­sive ac­tions to con­tain, trace and iso­late the close con­tacts.”</p>
    <p>It added that more than 60 per cent of the work­ers have re­cov­ered, and the mea­sures taken have re­sulted in “ef­fec­tive con­tain­ment”, with few ad­di­tional cases de­tected.</p>
    <p>Out of about 7,000 mi­grant work­ers quar­an­tined be­cause of the 100 new cases, fewer than 2 per cent were sub­se­quently found to be Covid-19 pos­i­tive.</p>
    <p>“These are be­ing man­aged ac­cord­ing to strict pro­to­cols,” the min­istries said.</p>
    <p>With the re­spon­si­bil­ity fall­ing on em­ploy­ers to sched­ule their mi­grant work­ers for rou­tine test­ing, seven in 10 em­ploy­ers have, to date, be­gun to do so through the on­line swab regis­tra­tion sys­tem.</p>
    <p>There are cur­rently about 18,600 work­ers over­all who are still serv­ing quar­an­tine.</p>
    <p>These in­clude the lat­est group of 800 work­ers who were quar­an­tined be­cause a case was dis­cov­ered among them in a cleared dor­mi­tory, which was re­ported last Wed­nes­day.</p>
    <p>The two min­istries said the In­terA­gency Task­force is tak­ing a “mea­sured ap­proach” with these 800 work­ers, with im­me­di­ate close con­tacts of the in­fected worker be­ing con­veyed to a ded­i­cated quar­an­tine fa­cil­ity. The other res­i­dents of the dor­mi­tory block are also in quar­an­tine as they await test­ing.</p>
    <p>When new cases are de­tected on a cleared site, the en­tire block will be “promptly quar­an­tined” as a pre­cau­tion­ary mea­sure, and all the work­ers swiftly tested, the min­istries noted.</p>
    <p>Num­ber of mi­grant work­ers quar­an­tined be­cause of the 100 new cases.</p>
    <p>Per­cent­age of the 7,000 quar­an­tined sub­se­quently found to be Covid-19 pos­i­tive.</p>
    <p>“We will re­scind the quar­an­tine sub­se­quently for work­ers who are as­sessed to be not at risk.</p>
    <p>“While this ap­proach could af­fect up to a few hun­dred mi­grant work­ers for each case, it en­sures that we con­tain the de­tected case and min­imise spread­ing that could end up af­fect­ing thou­sands (of) oth­ers.”</p>
    <p>The new in­fec­tion cases in cleared dor­mi­to­ries and tem­po­rary sites are re­minders of the need to be vig­i­lant, they added.</p>
    <p>The im­pact of safe dis­tanc­ing and seg­re­ga­tion mea­sures will be better as­sessed with more real-life data gath­ered.</p>
    <p>“This will help us as­sess pat­terns in the spread of in­fec­tions, and re­view the ex­tent of quar­an­tine re­quired to con­tain a de­tected case.</p>
    <p>“Our pri­or­ity will be to pre­vent and ar­rest new in­fec­tions through early de­tec­tion, timely con­tain­ment and ef­fec­tive iso­la­tion.”</p>
