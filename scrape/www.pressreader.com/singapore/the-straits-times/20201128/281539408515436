    <p>With not one, not two, but three Covid-19 vac­cines ap­ply­ing for emer­gency use au­tho­ri­sa­tion across the globe, and sev­eral oth­ers in clin­i­cal tri­als, in­clud­ing a home­grown can­di­date, Sin­ga­pore can be sure it will not have to put all its eggs in one bas­ket to keep its peo­ple safe from the coro­n­avirus.</p>
    <p>And it may also not have too long to wait.</p>
    <p>Pro­fes­sor Ooi Eng Eong, deputy direc­tor of Duke-NUS Med­i­cal School’s Emerg­ing In­fec­tious Dis­eases Pro­gramme, said: “We should use what­ever vac­cines with well-proven safety and efficacy as soon as pos­si­ble to pro­tect our pop­u­la­tion and re­turn to our nor­mal lives as much as, and as soon as pos­si­ble.”</p>
    <p>In the past few weeks, news of promis­ing in­terim late-trial re­sults for three vac­cine can­di­dates has come thick and fast, help­ing to in­ject some joy into a world weighed down by a pan­demic that has in­fected more than 61 mil­lion peo­ple and claimed over 1.4 mil­lion lives.</p>
    <p>Phar­ma­ceu­ti­cal gi­ant Pfizer and its Ger­man part­ner, BioNTech, were first off the blocks, an­nounc­ing on Nov 9 that their vac­cine can­di­date was more than 90 per cent ef­fec­tive i n pre­vent­ing peo­ple from get­ting the dis­ease. This went up to 95 per cent when it re­leased the first set of com­plete re­sults on Nov 18.</p>
    <p>Fast on its heels was US phar­ma­ceu­ti­cal firm Moderna, which said on Nov 16 that its vac­cine can­di­date had demon­strated an efficacy rate of 94.5 per cent.</p>
    <p>As­traZeneca was third in the vac­cine race to an­nounce it had a po­ten­tial win­ner on its hands.</p>
    <p>Last Mon­day, it said that the vac­cine can­di­date it is de­vel­op­ing with Ox­ford Univer­sity had an efficacy rate of up to 90 per cent if a lower first dose was used with a reg­u­lar sec­ond dose. Oth­er­wise, with two stan­dard doses, the efficacy rate was 62 per cent.</p>
    <p>“To achieve 90 per cent to 95 per cent vac­cine efficacy in out­break con­di­tions with a novel pathogen within a year of dis­cov­ery is as re­mark­able as two golfers play­ing on a com­pletely un­fa­mil­iar green, who have just hit holes-in-one,” said As­so­ci­ate Pro­fes­sor Lim Poh Lian, the head of the Trav­ellers’ Health and Vac­ci­na­tion Clinic at</p>
    <p>Tan Tock Seng Hospi­tal.</p>
    <p>Health Min­is­ter Gan Kim Yong has said Sin­ga­pore will work to­wards “se­cur­ing a port­fo­lio” of Covid-19 vac­cines to cater to dif­fer­ent seg­ments of the pop­u­la­tion.</p>
    <p>Asked which vac­cine he was most ex­cited about, Prof Ooi, prin­ci­pal in­ves­ti­ga­tor for Lu­narCoV19, the vac­cine can­di­date be­ing de­vel­oped by Arc­turus Ther­a­peu­tics in the United States and the Duke-NUS Med­i­cal School here, replied: “I will take the first avail­able li­censed vac­cine.”</p>
    <p>News that the three vac­cine can­di­dates can be 90 per cent to 95 per cent ef­fec­tive gave cause for op­ti­mism that the world could turn the cor­ner in the virus bat­tle.</p>
    <p>How­ever, while the vac­cines do pre­vent most peo­ple from fall­ing ill with Covid-19, there is no data to show they stop a per­son from be­ing in­fected, then pass­ing the in­fec­tion on even with­out get­ting sick; or how long they last.</p>
    <p>“Asymp­to­matic Sars-CoV-2 in­fec­tion in vac­ci­nated in­di­vid­u­als could still al­low the virus to spread in our com­mu­nity and cause Covid-19 in un­vac­ci­nated in­di­vid­u­als,” said Prof Ooi.</p>
    <p>Ex­perts have stressed that no vac­cine is per­fect. So, while a good vac­cine boosts a per­son’s im­mune sys­tem to give them a head­start in</p>
    <p>News that the three vac­cine can­di­dates can be 90 per cent to 95 per cent ef­fec­tive gave cause for op­ti­mism that the world could turn the cor­ner in the virus bat­tle. How­ever, while the vac­cines do pre­vent most peo­ple from fall­ing ill with Covid-19, there is no data to show they stop a per­son from be­ing in­fected, then pass­ing the in­fec­tion on even with­out get­ting sick; or how long they last.</p>
    <p>fight­ing a dis­ease, it may not con­fer 100 per cent pro­tec­tion, nor will it work on ev­ery­one. It can also wear off in time. Peo­ple who re­ceived a shot against mumps or whoop­ing cough, for in­stance, may still pass it on.</p>
    <p>Even so, when enough peo­ple are vac­ci­nated, and the virus can­not travel as eas­ily from per­son to per­son – the en­tire com­mu­nity is less likely to get the dis­ease.</p>
    <p>Prof Ooi said it would take time to de­ter­mine if any vac­cine can pre­vent the Sars-CoV-2 in­fec­tion.</p>
    <p>“We should thus sus­tain a pipe­line of new vac­cines so that we can find those that are most ef­fec­tive at sus­tain­ing pro­tec­tion against Covid-19 and pos­si­bly even elim­i­nat­ing Sars-CoV-2 from the hu­man pop­u­la­tion,” he said.</p>
    <p>At a we­bi­nar hosted by The Straits Times on Wed­nes­day, Sin­ga­pore’s chief health sci­en­tist, Pro­fes­sor Tan Chorh Chuan, said that Covid-19 vac­cines on the cusp of be­ing ap­proved would com­pletely shift the bat­tle against the pan­demic but they can­not elim­i­nate all other mea­sures.</p>
    <p>“It’d be a game changer be­cause it’d al­low us to blunt, very sub­stan­tially, many of the neg­a­tive im­pacts of the Covid-19 pan­demic,” he said.</p>
    <p>“But while it will be a game changer, it will not be a sil­ver bul­let. As all of us know, the sup­ply will be limited.”</p>
    <p>It will prob­a­bly be a year or two be­fore enough doses are made avail­able to vac­ci­nate enough peo­ple around the world, he said.</p>
    <p>In the mean­time, the pub­lic will still have to adhere to safe distancing mea­sures as there will still be a “very sub­stan­tial risk of trans­mis­sion and out­breaks”.</p>
    <p>Prof Tan, who is part of a 14-mem­ber com­mit­tee formed re­cently to pri­ori­tise the peo­ple who should be given the vac­cines as they be­come avail­able, said a Covid-19 vac­cine will al­low the world to pro­tect health­care work­ers and older, more vul­ner­a­ble peo­ple who are at higher risk of mor­tal­ity.</p>
    <p>One of the prob­lems that health sys­tems in many places have faced is that their med­i­cal staff be­come in­fected in the course of their work or in the com­mu­nity, thus re­duc­ing the health­care work­force when it is most needed, he said.</p>
    <p>Racing ahead</p>
    <p>Right now, hu­man tri­als of at least 48 Covid-19 vac­cine can­di­dates are in progress.</p>
    <p>The suc­cess in har­ness­ing new tech­nol­ogy marks a turn­ing point in the field, but also un­der­scores that the hunt for a vac­cine has en­tered un­charted ter­ri­tory.</p>
    <p>Pfizer and Moderna’s vac­cines are the most novel, be­ing based on mes­sen­ger RNA (mRNA), a ge­netic blue­print which in­structs hu­man cells to make the coro­n­avirus’ spike pro­tein to in­duce an im­mune re­sponse.</p>
    <p>While DNA and RNA vac­cines have been de­vel­oped against other dis­eases, such as HIV, and gone through early stage tri­als, none has been ap­proved for use in humans.</p>
    <p>The As­traZeneca-Ox­ford vac­cine is made from a cold virus known as an ade­n­ovirus that is de­rived from chim­panzees – so it is harm­less to peo­ple, and ge­net­i­cally mod­i­fied to carry a gene for the spike pro­tein. Such vac­cines have yet to be li­censed for use in humans, though this tech­nol­ogy has been around for many years.</p>
    <p>The body makes use of the in­for­ma­tion en­coded in the spike gene to make the spike pro­tein, which then trains the im­mune sys­tem to recog­nise and re­act against this char­ac­ter­is­tic fea­ture of SarsCoV-2, said Prof Ooi.</p>
    <p>The dif­fer­ence is that the vac­cine de­vel­oped by As­traZeneca and Ox­ford makes use of chim­panzee ade­n­ovirus to “carry” the spike gene while the other two vac­cine can­di­dates con­structed the spike gene in the form of RNA, which is then taken up by the cells as a tem­plate for mak­ing the spike pro­tein.</p>
    <p>The form that the spike gene takes in these vac­cines means that their stor­age con­di­tions dif­fer.</p>
    <p>In the mRNA vac­cines, the RNA of the spike gene is pack­aged in­side lipid (fat) nanopar­ti­cles, which are less sta­ble and, depend­ing on the chem­i­cal com­po­si­tion of the lipids, would re­quire lower tem­per­a­tures to re­main sta­ble dur­ing ship­ment and stor­age.</p>
    <p>As for the As­traZeneca/Ox­ford vac­cine, the spike gene is en­cased in­side the pro­tein shell of the ade­n­ovirus, which is among the most sta­ble forms of viruses in the world, and can thus be shipped and stored un­der re­frig­er­ated con­di­tions.</p>
    <p>This is why ex­perts have said it is likely to have a wider roll-out than, say, Pfizer’s mRNA vac­cine, which must be stored in ul­tra-cold con­di­tions. How­ever, doubts have been raised over the efficacy of this vac­cine, as the de­vel­op­ers have ac­knowl­edged an error in the vac­cine dosage that led to some study par­tic­i­pants get­ting a lower first dose, though this reg­i­men turned out to be a win­ner. These are the peo­ple aged 55 and be­low, so it is not clear if this dos­ing regime would of­fer the same cov­er­age for older peo­ple.</p>
    <p>Stor­age that re­quires spe­cial freez­ers presents a ma­jor lo­gis­ti­cal chal­lenge. Cost is also a fac­tor in vac­cine dis­tri­bu­tion.</p>
    <p>As­traZeneca has promised to make no profit from its vac­cine while the pan­demic lasts. Its dose is re­port­edly cheaper – at about US$4 (S$5.40), com­pared with around US$20 for Pfizer’s vac­cine and be­tween US$25 and US$37 for Moderna’s vac­cine.</p>
    <p>The vac­cine can­di­date from Arc­turus and Duke-NUS is also based on mRNA. Arc­turus has said it could be shipped out in the first quar­ter of next year.</p>
    <p>Are these vac­cines safe?</p>
    <p>The speed at which Covid-19 vac­cines are be­ing de­vel­oped has been de­scribed as in­cred­i­ble and ex­tra­or­di­nary.</p>
    <p>It is an un­prece­dented pace made pos­si­ble by par­al­lel pro­cess­ing, said Prof Ooi.</p>
    <p>“Con­ven­tion­ally, each step of the vac­cine devel­op­ment is done se­ri­ally, one after an­other. This is so that vac­cine de­vel­op­ers can avoid com­mit­ting large fi­nan­cial re­sources pre­ma­turely to a vac­cine that may not work as de­sired,” he said.</p>
    <p>But the ur­gency of the Covid-19 pan­demic caused many com­pa­nies and teams to take on the fi­nan­cial risks and ac­cel­er­ate vac­cine devel­op­ment.</p>
    <p>“Im­por­tantly, there have been no short­cuts in de­ter­min­ing vac­cine safety and efficacy.”</p>
    <p>Sci­en­tists have also been able to ac­cel­er­ate the Covid-19 vac­cine devel­op­ment process be­cause of vast im­prove­ments in vac­cine tech­nol­ogy, said Prof Tan.</p>
    <p>The mRNA and ade­n­ovi­ral vec­tor vac­cines, for in­stance, can be de­signed, de­vel­oped and tested much faster than by tra­di­tional meth­ods.</p>
    <p>He pointed out that the more com­mon side-ef­fects, such as pain at the in­jec­tion site or fever after vac­ci­na­tion, as well as rare side-ef­fects, will be picked up at the tri­als as they have been done at a very sub­stan­tial scale. How­ever, “some of the very rare side-ef­fects and some of those side-ef­fects which may take some time be­fore they man­i­fest will not be picked up right now”.</p>
    <p>This is why the plan­ning does not end at the vac­ci­na­tion stage.</p>
    <p>“We track the sort of side-ef­fects that arise fol­low­ing vac­ci­na­tion and try to pick up as early as pos­si­ble any signs of very rare or se­ri­ous kinds of prob­lems, and that then we take ac­tion very quickly,” he said.</p>
    <p>“This is an area that reg­u­la­tors and med­i­cal sys­tems around the world are look­ing at very care­fully and there will be very in­ten­sive surveil­lance, if and when vac­ci­na­tions be­gin.”</p>
    <p>At the start, Covid-19 vac­ci­na­tion could be ap­proved or rec­om­mended for only some groups, for which data has shown the vac­cine to be safe and ef­fec­tive, he added.</p>
    <p>Prof Lim, who is also a se­nior con­sul­tant at the Na­tional Cen­tre for In­fec­tious Dis­eases and a mem­ber of the Min­istry of Health’s ex­pert com­mit­tee on Covid-19 vac­ci­na­tion, said there is much hard work ahead, with re­gard to scru­ti­n­is­ing vac­cine safety, tol­er­a­bil­ity and du­ra­tion of pro­tec­tion.</p>
    <p>The ex­perts will also need to an­a­lyse vac­cine safety and efficacy in dif­fer­ent groups, such as older adults, chil­dren, preg­nant women, im­muno­com­pro­mised per­sons and those of var­i­ous eth­nic­i­ties, she said.</p>
    <p>“There will be even harder work with prac­ti­cal as­pects of vac­cine de­liv­ery, and mak­ing it ac­ces­si­ble to peo­ple who need it, and peo­ple who want it,” said Prof Lim. “But there is good rea­son that with these vac­cine clin­i­cal trial re­sults, we fi­nally have real hope that help is com­ing.”</p>
