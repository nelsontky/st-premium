    <p>•</p>
    <p>DUNMORE (Ire­land) In the pubs of Dunmore in the west of Ire­land, the Guin­ness glasses gather dust and the kegs are stacked dor­mant. Among the lo­cals, a sober mood has taken hold.</p>
    <p>The lengthy coro­n­avirus shut­down of pubs in Ire­land has hit the 3,000 or so peo­ple in the vil­lage and sur­round­ing area par­tic­u­larly hard.</p>
    <p>Five out of its six vil­lage pubs have been shut since March, de­priv­ing the com­mu­nity of in­sti­tu­tions which act as pil­lars of ru­ral life.</p>
    <p>Pub­li­can Joe Sheri­dan un­bolts the door of Walsh’s Bar in the County Gal­way vil­lage.</p>
    <p>“They drink their pints along coun­ters like that with their peers to dis­cuss pol­i­tics, to dis­cuss the news of the day, to un­der­stand what’s go­ing on in their own life,” he said.</p>
    <p>“I have peo­ple that would con­fide in me here in the bar that may not nec­es­sar­ily say to their GP (doc­tor) what’s go­ing on with them.”</p>
    <p>With bars shut, “you can see the peo­ple car­ry­ing the woes of life on their faces”, said Mr Sheri­dan, a sev­enth-gen­er­a­tion pub­li­can.</p>
    <p>In­side his wood-pan­elled pub, he finds a pile of un­opened post and the musty smell of in­ac­tiv­ity.</p>
    <p>Walls are jammed with group pho­tos, sports mem­o­ra­bilia and dusty bot­tles.</p>
    <p>It is tes­ta­ment to the pub’s fluid role as com­mu­nity hall, mu­seum and an un­der­stated sort of group cathar­sis in the vil­lage.</p>
    <p>“The lights are go­ing out in ru­ral Ire­land,” he said.</p>
    <p>Ir­ish pubs shut on March 16, as the na­tion braced it­self for the pan­demic, which has so far claimed 1,777 lives.</p>
    <p>Af­ter a 15-week hi­ber­na­tion, those serv­ing food were per­mit­ted to re­open.</p>
    <p>But so-called “wet pubs” serv­ing drink only re­mained shut, with the gov­ern­ment re­peat­edly push­ing back re­open­ing.</p>
    <p>Re­stric­tions are due to ex­pire next Sun­day in what the Drinks In­dus­try Group of Ire­land has called the “long­est lock­down in the Euro­pean Union”.</p>
    <p>In­dus­try bod­ies es­ti­mate that around half of the Repub­lic’s 7,000 pubs are still shut­tered.</p>
    <p>“The vast ma­jor­ity of these pubs are small ru­ral out­lets run by fam­i­lies who are on first-name terms with their cus­tomers,” said Vint­ners Fed­er­a­tion of Ire­land chief Padraig Cribben in July.</p>
    <p>In ru­ral Ire­land, pubs have a par­tic­u­lar char­ac­ter. They are mod­estly sized, humbly dec­o­rated and staffed by friends and fam­ily.</p>
    <p>Many are not equipped for restau­rant food ser­vice.</p>
    <p>One Dunmore pub has re­opened un­der gov­ern­ment guide­lines by pair­ing with a lo­cal take­away to pro­vide sit-in meals.</p>
    <p>With pop­u­la­tion flight, a de­clin­ing agri­cul­ture in­dus­try and scant al­ter­na­tive so­cial out­lets, pubs in ru­ral Ire­land play a role that is hard to over­state.</p>
    <p>Many peo­ple in the coun­try­side still eat their main daily meal at lunchtime, re­serv­ing a stretch of un­in­ter­rupted evening for the pub.</p>
    <p>His­tor­i­cally, pubs have acted as hard­ware stores, gro­cery shops and drap­ers, fill­ing the void of state in­fras­truc­ture with small busi­ness and mu­tual aid.</p>
    <p>In Dunmore, three pubs still act as un­der­tak­ers when reg­u­lars die, or­gan­is­ing the funeral and for fel­low drinkers to dig the grave.</p>
    <p>“It’s the thing of a ‘meitheal’,” ex­plained Mr Sheri­dan. “It’s an Ir­ish word for a group com­ing to­gether to work vol­un­tar­ily.”</p>
    <p>But the lock­down is “mess­ing with tra­di­tions that have been built up over gen­er­a­tions”, he said.</p>
    <p>Dunmore vil­lage – nested in im­prob­a­bly green fields laced by grey stone walls – is home to just 600.</p>
    <p>An out­sider may think its six pubs ex­isted in fierce com­pe­ti­tion.</p>
    <p>But Mr Sheri­dan views them each as nodes in an ecosys­tem of sup­port with sub­tly dif­fer­ent vibes and nav­i­gated by lo­cals ac­cord­ing to need and pref­er­ence.</p>
    <p>Al­co­hol seems al­most be­sides the point.</p>
    <p>“It’s nearly like the jun­gle grapevine,” said the 49-year-old, who also serves as a coun­cil­lor for the cen­tre-right Fianna Fail party cur­rently in gov­ern­ment. “The pub­lic house acts as a con­duit for com­mu­ni­ties.”</p>
    <p>While ru­ral de­cline is noth­ing new, coro­n­avirus clo­sures are “throw­ing petrol on the fire”, he added.</p>
    <p>Homes scat­tered out­side Dunmore are now where Mr Sheri­dan’s cus­tomers – many of them older, sin­gle men – spend time siloed alone.</p>
    <p>Days are bro­ken up by sprawl­ing coun­try­side walks – with slim chance of so­cial in­ter­ac­tion – and the clock­work visit of the post­man.</p>
    <p>“Here you have noth­ing to look at but the light­bulb, like a moth,” said Mr Bren­dan Jor­dan, 51.</p>
    <p>His three or four weekly vis­its to the pub gave respite from the care he gives his dis­abled sis­ter.</p>
    <p>“They are seg­re­gat­ing us out here in the coun­try­side and no­body cares,” said bach­e­lor farmer John Hussey, 52. “They have ev­ery­thing killed in the ru­ral ar­eas.”</p>
