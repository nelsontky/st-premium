    <p>Thirty-five new cases of Covid-19, all im­ported, were con­firmed here yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The num­ber is the high­est daily fig­ure since Sept 14, when there were 48 cases. The high­est fig­ure for im­ported cases be­fore this was on March 28, when there were 42 such cases.</p>
    <p>The new cases take Sin­ga­pore’s to­tal con­firmed in­fec­tions to 58,697.</p>
    <p>An­nounc­ing the num­bers, the Min­istry of Health (MOH) said all the in­fected in­di­vid­u­als had been on stay-home no­tice or were in iso­la­tion when they were tested.</p>
    <p>Sep­a­rately, MOH said it had found links be­tween pre­vi­ously an­nounced cases, which now form two clus­ters, each with four in­di­vid­u­als who are linked.</p>
    <p>One of the clus­ters in­volves a ma­rine sur­veyor who was an­nounced as a Covid-19 case on Dec 30, while the other in­volves a har­bour pi­lot who had ear­lier been detected from ros­tered rou­tine test­ing.</p>
    <p>One of yes­ter­day’s new cases is a cargo pi­lot who ar­rived from the United States via Aus­tralia. He was sent di­rectly to the Na­tional Cen­tre for In­fec­tious Diseases (NCID), where he was tested and con­firmed to have Covid-19.</p>
    <p>His sero­log­i­cal test re­sult also came back pos­i­tive.</p>
    <p>An­other of the cases was a ship crew mem­ber who boarded a ves­sel in In­done­sia in March last year.</p>
    <p>He de­vel­oped a fever on Dec 23 but self-med­i­cated. He was later placed on quar­an­tine on board the ship on Dec 31 as he had been iden­ti­fied as a close con­tact of a pre­vi­ously re­ported case, an­other crew mem­ber on the same ves­sel.</p>
    <p>The sailor an­nounced in yes­ter­day’s cases did not de­clare his symp­toms un­til a tele­con­sul­ta­tion with a doc­tor on Satur­day. He was then taken to NCID, where he tested pos­i­tive for Covid-19.</p>
    <p>MOH said the man never dis­em­barked from the ves­sel, and that all its re­main­ing crew mem­bers have been placed un­der quar­an­tine.</p>
    <p>Over­all, the num­ber of new cases in the com­mu­nity in­creased from one case in the week be­fore last to 10 cases last week.</p>
    <p>The num­ber of un­linked cases in the com­mu­nity also in­creased from one case in the week be­fore last to four last week.</p>
    <p>A to­tal of 64 pa­tients re­main in hospi­tal while 117 are re­cu­per­at­ing in com­mu­nity fa­cil­i­ties. One pa­tient is in crit­i­cal con­di­tion in the</p>
    <p>Over­all, the num­ber of new cases in the com­mu­nity in­creased from one case in the week be­fore last to 10 cases last week.</p>

    <p>in­ten­sive care unit.</p>
    <p>Twenty-nine peo­ple have died from the virus here, while 15 oth­ers who had Covid-19 died of other com­pli­ca­tions.</p>
    <p>Eleven more peo­ple were dis­charged yes­ter­day, bring­ing the to­tal num­ber of those dis­charged here to 58,472.</p>
