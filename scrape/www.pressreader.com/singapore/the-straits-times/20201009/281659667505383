    <p>A guide on how meet­ings, in­cen­tives, con­ven­tions and ex­hi­bi­tions (Mice) events can be held safely has been rolled out to help or­gan­is­ers as business events are grad­u­ally al­lowed to re­sume.</p>
    <p>The Event In­dus­try Re­silience Roadmap un­veiled yes­ter­day also in­cludes in­for­ma­tion on the ben­e­fits of hy­brid events – those with both phys­i­cal and vir­tual at­ten­dees – and a plan to sup­port en­ter­prises in the in­dus­try.</p>
    <p>The road map was de­vel­oped by the Sin­ga­pore As­so­ci­a­tion of Con­ven­tion and Ex­hi­bi­tion Or­gan­is­ers and Sup­pli­ers (Saceos) with En­ter­prise Sin­ga­pore (ESG) and the Sin­ga­pore Tourism Board (STB).</p>
    <p>Saceos pres­i­dent Aloy­sius Ar­lando told a brief­ing: “The (road map) will help Mice en­ter­prises re­dis­cover ways to re­build a suc­cess­ful business and re­store the vi­brancy and com­pet­i­tive­ness of the in­dus­try.”</p>
    <p>An up­dated road map that will be un­veiled at a later date will ex­pand on ways firms in the Mice in­dus­try can boost their ca­pa­bil­i­ties so they can pivot ef­fi­ciently to the hy­brid model amid the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>The sec­tor sprang back to life on Oct 1 when or­gan­is­ers re­ceived the green light to ap­ply to pi­lot Mice events with up to 250 at­ten­dees, with all pro­pos­als re­viewed by the STB and the Min­istry of Trade and In­dus­try.</p>
    <p>The first of these will be the Sin­ga­pore In­ter­na­tional En­ergy Week con­fer­ence at Ma­rina Bay Sands from Oct 26 to 30.</p>
    <p>Mr Ar­lando noted that as events progress to­wards a hy­brid model, or­gan­is­ers will need to deal with phys­i­cal and vir­tual au­di­ences and con­sider how to best en­gage them in both of­fline and on­line medi­ums. What they even­tu­ally set­tle on will de­pend on their business model, he said.</p>
    <p>He added that pi­lot events will help the in­dus­try ar­rive at a “com­mer­cially vi­able hy­brid plat­form”.</p>
    <p>Saceos vice-pres­i­dent of dig­i­tal and in­no­va­tion Veemal Gun­gadin noted that there are costs associated with hold­ing hy­brid events such as set­ting up stu­dios, buy­ing new equip­ment and other in­fras­truc­ture needs to meet safe dis­tanc­ing rules.</p>
    <p>This means that ini­tially, it will prob­a­bly cost more to hold such events com­pared with con­ven­tional phys­i­cal ones, he said.</p>
    <p>But there are ini­tia­tives to have more cen­tralised fa­cil­i­ties that firms can lever­age, which will mean lower costs even­tu­ally, Mr Gun­gadin said.</p>
    <p>A mem­o­ran­dum of un­der­stand­ing was also signed be­tween Saceos and the Na­tional Trades Union Congress to es­tab­lish the Mice and Events Ca­pa­bil­ity Build­ing Net­work yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>This ef­fort, which is sup­ported by the STB, ESG, Work­force Sin­ga­pore and Skills Fu­ture Sin­ga­pore, will help de­velop the skills of Mice pro­fes­sion­als, in­clud­ing free­lancers and self-em­ployed peo­ple.</p>
    <p>The net­work will part­ner ed­u­ca­tional in­sti­tu­tions to de­velop blue­prints of new and re­freshed ca­reer paths and cre­ate train­ing pro­grammes.</p>
