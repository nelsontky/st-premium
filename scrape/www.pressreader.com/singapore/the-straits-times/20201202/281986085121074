    <p>Thirty years ago, the in­for­ma­tion tech­nol­ogy (IT) pub­li­ca­tion I was edit­ing – IT Sin­ga­pore – fea­tured the suc­cess sto­ries of Sin­ga­pore busi­nesses us­ing in­for­ma­tion tech­nol­ogy so­lu­tions to raise ef­fi­ciency and pro­duc­tiv­ity.</p>
    <p>They achieved that by avoid­ing or min­imis­ing hu­man er­rors caused by man­ual data en­try, among other things.</p>
    <p>Con­cepts such as com­pat­i­bil­ity be­tween hard­ware, be­tween hard­ware and soft­ware, and be­tween soft­ware, in­ter-op­er­abil­ity be­tween sys­tems and ap­pli­ca­tions, as well as ap­pli­ca­tion pro­gram­ming in­ter­face, were al­ready be­ing pro­moted in the 1980s.</p>
    <p>Last week, I was sur­prised when the food that I or­dered on­line from a restau­rant was set to be de­liv­ered to the wrong res­i­dence due to an in­cor­rect street ad­dress keyed in man­u­ally by its em­ployee.</p>
    <p>For­tu­nately for the de­liv­ery rider, I saw him search­ing around the neigh­bour­hood and asked if he was de­liv­er­ing my or­der. I showed him my on­line or­der bear­ing my home ad­dress on my phone and he showed me the or­der with the wrong ad­dress on his.</p>
    <p>Last month, food was de­liv­ered to my ad­dress by mis­take.</p>
    <p>Th­ese in­ci­dents may be­lie a se­ri­ous prob­lem un­der­min­ing our na­tional dig­i­tal­i­sa­tion ef­forts.</p>
    <p>I shud­der to think how many such er­rors are made each day in other in­dus­tries. Each time an er­ror oc­curs, the pay-per-task front-line worker may suf­fer fi­nan­cially.</p>
    <p>What has hap­pened to the in­ter-op­er­abil­ity and com­pat­i­bil­ity of IT sys­tems and so­lu­tions touted more than 30 years ago in Sin­ga­pore?</p>
    <p>Even if ap­pli­ca­tion pro­gram­ming in­ter­face is still a real is­sue in get­ting IT sys­tems to “talk” to one an­other, what about good old-fash­ioned dili­gence when do­ing man­ual data en­try and check­ing de­tails when ex­e­cut­ing in­struc­tions?</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore has pro­gressed by leaps and bounds in its ap­pli­ca­tion of IT since the 1980s.</p>
    <p>The IT 2000 Master­plan, the In­tel­li­gent Na­tion 2015</p>
    <p>Master­plan and the Ser­vices and Dig­i­tal Econ­omy Tech­nol­ogy Roadmap of 2018 have been chart­ing the way for­ward for Sin­ga­pore to be­come a smart na­tion.</p>
    <p>Ba­sic dili­gence re­mains cru­cial when we are work­ing with de­tails. This re­quires dis­ci­pline when ex­e­cut­ing or­ders and other in­struc­tions in the real world, with and with­out IT ap­pli­ca­tions, in busi­ness or in daily life.</p>
