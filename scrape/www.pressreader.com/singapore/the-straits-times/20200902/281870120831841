    <p>Sin­ga­pore’s lead­ers have of­fered con­do­lences to their In­dian coun­ter­parts and the fam­ily of the South Asian na­tion’s former pres­i­dent Pranab Mukher­jee, who died on Mon­day, aged 84.</p>
    <p>In a let­ter to In­dian Pres­i­dent Ram Nath Kovind yes­ter­day, Pres­i­dent Hal­imah Ya­cob ex­alted Mr</p>
    <p>Mukher­jee for his dis­tinc­tive con­tri­bu­tion to In­dia dur­ing his years of serv­ing the coun­try.</p>
    <p>“In­dia has lost one of her finest sons,” Madam Hal­imah wrote.</p>
    <p>“As In­dia’s 13th Pres­i­dent from 2012 to 2017, Shri Mukher­jee was down-to-earth and served with hu­mil­ity. His un­wa­ver­ing com­mit­ment to im­prove the lives of the In­dian peo­ple will serve as a last­ing bea­con of in­spi­ra­tion to many,” she added.</p>
    <p>Prime Min­is­ter Lee Hsien Loong called the late pres­i­dent “a tow­er­ing leader with a heart for the com­mon man” and said he had per­son­ally known him for many years.</p>
    <p>“He leaves be­hind a shin­ing legacy of serv­ing oth­ers, build­ing con­sen­sus and ris­ing above party pol­i­tics. In to­day’s world, these pre­cious traits will be es­pe­cially missed,” Mr Lee said in a con­do­lence let­ter to his In­dian coun­ter­part Naren­dra Modi.</p>
    <p>Emer­i­tus Se­nior Min­is­ter Goh</p>
    <p>Chok Tong sent con­do­lences to Mr Mukher­jee’s son, Mr Ab­hi­jit Mukher­jee, and said he re­mem­bered the late leader “as a stal­wart leader and an ex­em­plary diplo­mat”.</p>
    <p>“Dur­ing our con­ver­sa­tions, I was al­ways struck by his po­lit­i­cal as­tute­ness, sharp in­sights and un­wa­ver­ing ded­i­ca­tion to In­dia,” Mr Goh wrote in his mes­sage.</p>
    <p>“His abil­ity to forge con­sen­sus on dif­fi­cult is­sues bears tes­ta­ment to the deep re­spect that he com­manded across the po­lit­i­cal aisle as well as his tal­ent in uni­fy­ing peo­ple. It is my hope that your father’s legacy will con­tinue to guide and in­spire fu­ture gen­er­a­tions of In­di­ans,” he added.</p>
    <p>Mr Mukher­jee, who was a fi­nance min­is­ter be­fore he be­came pres­i­dent, died at a New Delhi hospi­tal where he was be­ing treated for a lung in­fec­tion.</p>
