    <p>A High Court hear­ing for the Sin­ga­pore Demo­cratic Party’s (SDP) ap­peal against a correction di­rec­tion is­sued to it un­der the fake news law has been ad­journed to a date to be fixed.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing a vir­tual hear­ing in cham­bers yes­ter­day, the party’s lawyers ap­plied for the case to be ad­journed un­til af­ter the Court of Ap­peal rules on two other ap­peals re­lated to the Pro­tec­tion from On­line False­hoods and Ma­nip­u­la­tion Act (Pofma) in­volv­ing the SDP and The On­line Cit­i­zen web­site.</p>
    <p>The lawyers – Mr Eu­gene Thu­raisingam, Mr Suang Wi­jaya and Mr Joel Wong – said Jus­tice Woo Bih Li granted the ad­journ­ment as there are over­lap­ping is­sues be­tween the SDP’s lat­est ap­peal and the ear­lier cases.</p>
    <p>“These over­lap­ping is­sues mainly in­volve ques­tions of where the bur­den of proof lies in Pofma ap­peals, and the man­ner in which Ar­ti­cle 14 of the Con­sti­tu­tion re­gard­ing the right to free speech in­ter­acts with the pro­vi­sions un­der Pofma,” Mr Wong told The Straits Times.</p>
    <p>He added that the out­come of the ear­lier cases could af­fect the judge’s de­ci­sion on the lat­est case, which in­volves the SDP’s claims about Sin­ga­pore hav­ing a pop­u­la­tion of 10 mil­lion by 2030, which it made dur­ing the re­cent gen­eral elec­tion cam­paign.</p>
    <p>On July 4, the au­thor­i­ties is­sued correction­s un­der Pofma against the Face­book pages of SDP, The On­line Cit­i­zen (TOC), Peo­ples Voice and “Sin Rak Sin Party”.</p>
    <p>In a Face­book post made on July 3, the SDP had quoted HDB chief ex­ec­u­tive Cheong Koon Hean as say­ing that Sin­ga­pore’s pop­u­la­tion den­sity would in­crease from 11,000 peo­ple per sq km to 13,700 peo­ple per sq km be­tween now and 2030.</p>
    <p>“Given our land area, this means that our pop­u­la­tion would go up to nearly 10 mil­lion by 2030,” the SDP added in its post.</p>
    <p>The Al­ter­nate Au­thor­ity for the Min­is­ter for Na­tional De­vel­op­ment, which is­sued the correction, said Dr Cheong had made no state­ment sug­gest­ing that Sin­ga­pore’s pop­u­la­tion would in­crease to 10 mil­lion by 2030. The SDP com­plied with the correction di­rec­tion on July 5 but said it would ap­ply to can­cel it.</p>
    <p>The Court of Ap­peal, com­pris­ing Chief Jus­tice Sun­daresh Menon and four Judges of Ap­peal, is set to hear the two ear­lier ap­peals by the SDP and TOC on Sept 17.</p>
    <p>In the ear­lier case by the SDP, Jus­tice Ang Cheng Hock had ruled on Feb 6 that the bur­den should fall on the Gov­ern­ment to prove a state­ment is false, be­cause in is­su­ing correction di­rec­tions, it is cur­tail­ing the right to free speech which is pro­tected by the Con­sti­tu­tion, among other things.</p>
    <p>But another High Court judge, Jus­tice Belinda Ang, gave a dif­fer­ent opin­ion in her rul­ing dis­miss­ing TOC’s ap­peal on Feb 19. She had said the onus is on the per­son who made the state­ment that re­ceived a correction to show it is true.</p>
    <p>TOC then filed an ap­peal to the apex court.</p>
