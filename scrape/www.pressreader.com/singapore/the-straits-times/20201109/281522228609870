    <p>Sin­ga­pore needs to keep up the vir­tu­ous cir­cle of good gover­nance that re­sults in po­lit­i­cal sta­bil­ity and en­ables long-term plan­ning, even as the Peo­ple’s Ac­tion Party (PAP) re­sponds to the coun­try’s chang­ing pol­i­tics, said Prime Min­is­ter Lee Hsien Loong at the PAP con­fer­ence, which was at­tended by 3,000 party ac­tivists.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore needs to keep up the vir­tu­ous cir­cle of good gover­nance that re­sults in po­lit­i­cal sta­bil­ity and en­ables long-term plan­ning, even as the Peo­ple’s Ac­tion Party (PAP) re­sponds to the coun­try’s chang­ing pol­i­tics, said Prime Min­is­ter Lee Hsien Loong yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The PAP gained strong po­lit­i­cal sup­port by de­liv­er­ing on as­pects such as hous­ing, education, health­care and se­cu­rity, he said.</p>
    <p>This re­sulted in po­lit­i­cal sta­bil­ity, and al­lowed the party to think long-term and bring good peo­ple into pol­i­tics.</p>
    <p>Tak­ing a long-term view, in turn, al­lowed it to de­liver bet­ter lives for all Sin­ga­pore­ans and fur­ther re­tain vot­ers’ con­fi­dence, he added.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore must keep this cy­cle go­ing for as long as pos­si­ble, PM Lee told 3,000 party ac­tivists at the PAP con­fer­ence. “Once we break it, it will be im­pos­si­ble for any party to re­store it, not even the PAP.”</p>
    <p>The hy­brid event – with cadres gath­ered at branches to elect the party’s cen­tral ex­ec­u­tive com­mit­tee, and party lead­ers and MPs at NTUC Cen­tre – was the party’s first ma­jor gath­er­ing after the July gen­eral election, where the PAP won 61 per cent of the votes and 83 out of 93 seats.</p>
    <p>PM Lee, the PAP’s sec­re­tary-gen­eral, noted that this out­come re­flected a broader de­sire for more al­ter­na­tive voices and a stronger op­po­si­tion to check the PAP Govern­ment.</p>
    <p>Many coun­tries have fiercely con­tested demo­cratic sys­tems and more ex­cit­ing pol­i­tics, but these do not al­ways de­liver good govern­ment, he said.</p>
    <p>In­stead, con­tes­ta­tion of­ten makes pol­i­tics un­sta­ble and di­vided, with those in power fo­cus­ing only on their own short-term po­lit­i­cal sur­vival, and those out of power of­fer­ing reme­dies with­out be­ing up­front about the costs and con­se­quences, he added.</p>
    <p>Gov­ern­ments can­not make longterm com­mit­ments or set a con­sis­tent long-term di­rec­tion as a re­sult.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore is not like that, PM Lee said. But to sus­tain the Sin­ga­pore model, the PAP can­not stand still as the coun­try and its pol­i­tics change, and has to adapt to what peo­ple want to see in their pol­i­tics.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore­ans still want sta­bil­ity and progress, job se­cu­rity and op­por­tu­ni­ties. But in­creas­ingly, they want to take part in shap­ing so­ci­ety, re-ex­am­ine ba­sic as­sump­tions and look beyond the tried-and-tested way of do­ing things, said PM Lee. They also want greater checks and balances, more ro­bust pub­lic de­bates and closer scru­tiny of govern­ment poli­cies.</p>
    <p>“These ex­pec­ta­tions and de­sires will only grow with ev­ery gen­er­a­tion of Sin­ga­pore­ans,” PM Lee said. The PAP has to re­spond to them. But, he added: “We must con­tinue rep­re­sent­ing all Sin­ga­pore­ans, and not just a par­tic­u­lar sliver or seg­ment of the pop­u­la­tion.”</p>
    <p>PM Lee also touched on the task of keep­ing Sin­ga­pore safe from the virus and get­ting the econ­omy back on track, stress­ing the need for the PAP to pro­vide strong lead­er­ship and give cit­i­zens con­fi­dence to over­come their most se­ri­ous cri­sis since in­de­pen­dence.</p>
    <p>The Govern­ment will also pay spe­cial at­ten­tion to lower-in­come groups, and work on balanc­ing the com­pe­ti­tion Sin­ga­porean work­ers face from for­eign­ers in the labour mar­ket with the need for the econ­omy to re­main open, he added.</p>
    <p>PM Lee also said lead­er­ship re­newal re­mains one of his top pri­or­i­ties but, as he had pre­vi­ously ex­plained, it was his duty to see the coun­try through the cri­sis be­fore hand­ing it over in good shape to the next team.</p>
    <p>“The PAP has kept it­self vig­or­ous and stayed in power by con­stantly evolv­ing and re­ju­ve­nat­ing our­selves, and keep­ing our poli­cies fresh and rel­e­vant to the times,” he said. “We have to keep on do­ing this, even as we forge fresh bonds be­tween the PAP and suc­ces­sive gen­er­a­tions of Sin­ga­pore­ans.”</p>
    <p>Speak­ing be­fore PM Lee, Deputy Prime Min­is­ter Heng Swee Keat, the PAP’s first as­sis­tant sec­re­tary­gen­eral, said the party has to re­tain its core strength of tak­ing ac­tion, to get the right things done, and con­tinue to win hearts and minds.</p>
    <p>“To do this more ef­fec­tively, we have to evolve how we en­gage a chang­ing elec­torate,” he said.</p>
    <p>“In a more tur­bu­lent and un­cer­tain fu­ture, the PAP will need to work even harder to build con­sen­sus and cre­ate the po­lit­i­cal space for us to do the right thing for Sin­ga­pore and Sin­ga­pore­ans,” he added.</p>
    <p>Lower-in­come groups and the is­sue of in­equal­ity will get spe­cial at­ten­tion from the Govern­ment as it helps com­pa­nies and work­ers through the Covid-19 cri­sis, said Prime Min­is­ter Lee Hsien Loong.</p>
    <p>Speak­ing at the Peo­ple’s Ac­tion Party (PAP) bi­en­nial con­fer­ence, PM Lee said a ma­jor worry about the pan­demic is that it could hurt low­er­in­come fam­i­lies dis­pro­por­tion­ately, and undo years of progress made to level up low-wage work­ers. This can­not be done through “glib slo­gans or half-baked pro­pos­als”, he said, but with a full range of prac­ti­cal sup­port mea­sures.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, he cited the Pro­gres­sive Wage Model, Work­fare and Sil­ver Sup­port, and said that the Govern­ment will de­velop new ways to help lower-in­come groups.</p>
    <p>PM Lee also ac­knowl­edged the worry Sin­ga­pore­ans have about com­pe­ti­tion from for­eign work pass hold­ers, and said he fully un­der­stood the pres­sures.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­porean work­ers must feel re­as­sured that the Govern­ment will help them hold their own against for­eign com­pe­ti­tion, and that they are fairly treated, he said. Fail­ing to do so will lead to a lot of “angst and so­cial ten­sion”. But the Govern­ment must also con­vince Sin­ga­pore­ans that the best way to pro­tect liveli­hoods and fam­i­lies is to keep Sin­ga­pore open for tal­ent and busi­ness, he added.</p>
    <p>PM Lee cau­tioned: “If we just close our­selves up and send away the work pass hold­ers, it will re­sult in fewer jobs and op­por­tu­ni­ties for Sin­ga­pore­ans, and more hard­ship for our work­ers and their fam­i­lies.”</p>
    <p>He also noted that the pan­demic is as much a po­lit­i­cal prob­lem as it is a pub­lic health prob­lem.</p>
    <p>Re­open­ing the econ­omy and re­lax­ing Covid-19 re­stric­tions is a del­i­cate balanc­ing act, he noted, point­ing to how many coun­tries had tried but failed to get the bal­ance right and seen in­fec­tions rise again.</p>
    <p>Those coun­tries had to lock down once more. But by then, peo­ple had be­come tired and cyn­i­cal about the re­stric­tions, caus­ing them to turn against their gov­ern­ments and blame lead­ers for bad out­comes.</p>
    <p>This il­lus­trates how it takes po­lit­i­cal lead­er­ship to con­vince peo­ple of the need to keep safety mea­sures in place, es­pe­cially when case numbers are low. “We must show peo­ple while we do all these things that we care for them, and we em­pathise with their dif­fi­cul­ties. And we must main­tain pub­lic trust in the Govern­ment and its lead­ers,” he added.</p>
    <p>“So that if we have to im­ple­ment new mea­sures or poli­cies, peo­ple will ac­cept them, co­op­er­ate with them, and give them a chance to work. Other­wise, it will be very dif­fi­cult for us to sur­vive this cri­sis with­out fur­ther mishap,” he said.</p>
    <p>PM Lee also stressed that in this time of cri­sis, it is es­pe­cially vi­tal to strengthen the part­ner­ship be­tween the PAP and NTUC.</p>
    <p>En­gage­ment on the ground be­tween party branches and in­di­vid­ual unions is “not so deep” as at the lead­er­ship level, he said, urg­ing MPs who serve as ad­vis­ers to var­i­ous unions to help on the ground and en­gage work­ers di­rectly. The PAP should re­cruit more union lead­ers, and have more ac­tivists in the unions, he said, adding that the close PAP-NTUC part­ner­ship will be a “pre­cious as­set” as Sin­ga­pore nav­i­gates an un­cer­tain fu­ture.</p>
    <p>“Work­ers will need a strong labour move­ment more than ever, while the Govern­ment will rely on the unions to ful­fil their re­spon­si­bil­i­ties, to pro­tect work­ers and take Sin­ga­pore for­ward,” he said.</p>

PM Lee said he was in&#xAD;formed through his mo&#xAD;bile phone of his neg&#xAD;a&#xAD;tive re&#xAD;sult in 15 min&#xAD;utes, and that the test was an ex&#xAD;am&#xAD;ple of how Sin&#xAD;ga&#xAD;pore is strength&#xAD;en&#xAD;ing its test&#xAD;ing ca&#xAD;pa&#xAD;bil&#xAD;i&#xAD;ties so it can open up fur&#xAD;ther safely.</p>
