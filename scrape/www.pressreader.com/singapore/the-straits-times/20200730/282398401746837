    <p>LON­DON • Manch­ester City showed a “bla­tant dis­re­gard” for Uefa’s in­ves­ti­ga­tion into al­leged Fi­nan­cial Fair Play (FFP) breaches, ac­cord­ing to the Court of Ar­bi­tra­tion for Sport (CAS) but Euro­pean foot­ball’s gov­ern­ing body failed to prove the English club had dis­guised fund­ing from their own­ers as spon­sor­ship in­come.</p>
    <p>Ear­lier this month, the CAS over­turned a two-year ban from Euro­pean com­pe­ti­tions im­posed on City by Uefa and re­duced a fine of €30 mil­lion (S$48.5 mil­lion) to</p>
    <p>€10 mil­lion. The de­ci­sion means City are able to com­pete in next sea­son’s Cham­pi­ons League.</p>
    <p>The full rea­soned judg­ment by the CAS re­leased on Tues­day showed that the fine was to re­flect “a se­vere breach” in City’s un­will­ing­ness to co­op­er­ate with Uefa’s in­ves­ti­ga­tion.</p>
    <p>But not­ing that the charges of al­leged con­ceal­ment of eq­uity fund­ing were more sig­nif­i­cant vi­o­la­tions, the CAS said “based on the ev­i­dence, the panel can­not reach the con­clu­sion that dis­guised fund­ing was paid to City”.</p>
    <p>The CAS also in­di­cated that wit­ness state­ments from se­nior City ex­ec­u­tives as well as a let­ter from owner Sheikh Man­sour – all pro­vided to CAS but not Uefa dur­ing the first process – could have swung the orig­i­nal ver­dict in City’s favour.</p>
    <p>“The ap­pealed de­ci­sion is there­fore not per se wrong but, at least to a cer­tain ex­tent, is a con­se­quence of MCFC’s de­ci­sion to pro­duce the most rel­e­vant ev­i­dence at its dis­posal only in the present ap­peal pro­ceed­ings be­fore CAS,” it said.</p>
    <p>The judg­ment also found that Uefa’s case was ham­strung by the ne­ces­sity to fi­nalise the ap­peal be­fore the start of the 2020-21 Cham</p>
    <p>The CAS also in­di­cated that wit­ness state­ments from se­nior City ex­ec­u­tives as well as a let­ter from owner Sheikh Man­sour – all pro­vided to the CAS but not Uefa dur­ing the first process – could have swung the orig­i­nal ver­dict in City’s favour.</p>
    <p>pi­ons League as it re­lin­quished a re­quest for more ev­i­dence to be pro­vided from City’s e-mails.</p>
    <p>Nine Pre­mier League clubs – Arse­nal, Burn­ley, Chelsea, Le­ices­ter, Liver­pool, Manch­ester United, New­cas­tle, Tot­ten­ham and Wolves – filed an ap­pli­ca­tion to CAS for City to be banned from Euro­pean com­pe­ti­tion if a ver­dict was not reached be­fore the start of the 2020-21 sea­son.</p>
    <p>City’s for­tunes on the field have been trans­formed since a takeover from Sheikh Man­sour, a mem­ber of the Abu Dhabi royal fam­ily, in 2008. The club were ac­cused of de­lib­er­ately in­flat­ing the value of in­come from Emi­rati spon­sors Eti­salat and Eti­had Air­ways to meet</p>
    <p>Uefa’s FFP reg­u­la­tions, which lim­its losses clubs can in­cur to spend on player trans­fer fees and wages.</p>
    <p>Uefa launched an in­ves­ti­ga­tion af­ter Ger­man mag­a­zine Der Spiegel pub­lished a se­ries of leaked e-mails re­lat­ing to City’s fi­nances in 2018.</p>
    <p>CAS ruled that the leaked doc­u­ments could be used as ev­i­dence but noted that they did not prove the ex­is­tence of any ac­tual trans­ac­tions that broke Uefa’s rules and no ev­i­dence was pro­duced that such pay­ments were car­ried out.</p>
    <p>The court also pointed out that the leaked e-mails were dis­trib­uted in­ter­nally and not sent to spon­sors or other parts of the club’s United Arab Emi­rates-based own­ers.</p>
