    <p>When in­fec­tions started to spike in for­eign worker dor­mi­to­ries in April, the pri­or­ity was to iso­late res­i­dents most at risk, in­clud­ing older ones and those who had other con­di­tions.</p>
    <p>At­ten­tion then turned to build­ing up ca­pac­ity for hun­dreds of thou­sands of oth­ers, said in­fec­tious dis­eases ex­pert Dale Fisher dur­ing The Straits Times Covid-19 we­bi­nar yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The fo­cus was on pre­vent­ing deaths, rather than transmissi­on. Such a strat­egy in tak­ing care of the mi­grant work­ers was “very novel”, he said.</p>
    <p>It helped keep deaths low, de­spite the high liv­ing den­sity in the dor­mi­to­ries. This was de­spite there be­ing no ca­pac­ity to iso­late all the mi­grant work­ers as was done for the com­mu­nity cases, said Pro­fes­sor Fisher, a se­nior in­fec­tious dis­eases con­sul­tant at the Na­tional Univer­sity Hos­pi­tal.</p>
    <p>“Part of this is why we’ve seen over 48,000 cases now and 27 deaths. The (low mor­tal­ity) is ab­so­lutely stag­ger­ing. The rest of the world is go­ing, ‘How did you do that?’”</p>
    <p>There were 341 new Covid-19 cases yes­ter­day among mi­grant work­ers liv­ing in dorms.</p>
    <p>New cases in dorms fell from a high of 1,369 on April 20 to be­tween 100 and 200 a day since the end of last month. But there have been over 300 new cases a day in dorms since Tues­day, when num­bers hit 399 cases that day.</p>
    <p>“There is still some transmissi­on ob­vi­ously hap­pen­ing, but a lot of the dorms... are be­ing cleared. But it’s been slow,” said Prof Fisher.</p>
    <p>A com­bi­na­tion of iso­la­tion, serol­ogy and poly­merase chain re­ac­tion tests is used to clear dorms.</p>
    <p>As of Wed­nes­day, 891 dorms, in­clud­ing pur­pose-built ones and tem­po­rary quar­ters, have been cleared of Covid-19. Ac­cord­ing to the Min­istry of Man­power’s web­site, over 1,200 dorms are slated to be cleared in the com­ing weeks.</p>
    <p>Prof Fisher said all mi­grant worker dorms should be cleared within weeks or a month.</p>
    <p>Min­is­ter for Na­tional De­vel­op­ment Lawrence Wong also said last Fri­day that as the coun­try nears the end of clear­ing the dorms, the num­ber of daily in­fec­tions among mi­grant work­ers can be ex­pected to rise. For the fi­nal phase of test­ing, many of the work­ers come from dorms with higher preva­lence of coro­n­avirus cases.</p>
    <p>Prof Fisher said the surge of in­fec­tions among mi­grant work­ers was “a marathon that (the coun­try) didn’t want to have”.</p>
    <p>“Every ef­fort is be­ing taken to en­sure that we’re not send­ing in­fected men out, and cre­at­ing new pro­to­cols to make sure that for those who didn’t get in­fected, there are no new clus­ters,” he said.</p>

There are even new de­signs for dor­mi­to­ries that are be­ing built, so we don’t have this again. ’’</p>
