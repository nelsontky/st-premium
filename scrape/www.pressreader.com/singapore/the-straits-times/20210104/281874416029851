    <p>MANILA • Filipinos are not let­ting the coro­n­avirus pan­demic pre­vent them from get­ting a roasted pig del­i­cacy onto their din­ing ta­bles dur­ing the hol­i­day sea­son, de­spite a hit to the dis­pos­able in­comes of many.</p>
    <p>Some peo­ple queued for hours and paid al­most dou­ble what a le­chon – the roast pig that is a sta­ple in Philip­pine fes­tiv­i­ties and fam­ily cel­e­bra­tions – would reg­u­larly cost, ac­cord­ing to a shop owner in Metro Manila’s La Loma district.</p>
    <p>A hog weigh­ing about 7kg would cost about 5,500 pe­sos (S$150) be­fore the hol­i­days, said Mr Ariel De­los Reyes, the coowner of Mang To­mas Na­tive Le­chon in La Loma.</p>
    <p>Mr De­los Reyes said he sold 400 roasted pigs last Thurs­day, about twice as many as a year ear­lier.</p>
    <p>Ms Rachel Rafisura, 30, a house­wife, waited in line for two hours to buy a whole le­chon for 10,000 pe­sos to serve on New Year’s Eve to main­tain a fam­ily tra­di­tion since get­ting mar­ried seven years ago.</p>
    <p>“The price has gone up a lot and times are bad, but my hus­band said we should con­tinue with our tra­di­tion,” Ms Rafisura said.</p>
    <p>It is for “good luck and pros­per­ity”, she said.</p>
    <p>The size of the Philip­pine work­force fell to 43.6 mil­lion in Oc­to­ber from 45.9 mil­lion in July, and Bloomberg sur­veys in­di­cate the coun­try prob­a­bly had the high­est job­less rate in Asia last year.</p>
    <p>Gov­ern­ment es­ti­mates showed strict move­ment re­stric­tions early last year had cost Manila res­i­dents about 2.1 bil­lion pe­sos in for­gone daily wages, com­pared with about 700 mil­lion pe­sos un­der cur­rent softer quar­an­tine mea­sures in the cap­i­tal.</p>
    <p>“Le­chon sig­ni­fies fi­nan­cial ca­pa­bil­ity – even if mo­men­tary,” said Mr Randy David, a so­ci­ol­o­gist and pro­fes­sor emer­i­tus at the Univer­sity of the Philip­pines.</p>
    <p>Al­most 477,000 coro­n­avirus cases have been re­ported in the coun­try, with deaths ex­ceed­ing 9,200. Gath­er­ings are capped at 10 peo­ple to con­tain in­fec­tions.</p>
