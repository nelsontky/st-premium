    <p>NEW YORK South Korea’s Kim Sei-young, seek­ing her first Ma­jor ti­tle, birdied five of her last six holes to seize a one-stroke lead af­ter Fri­day’s sec­ond round of the Women’s PGA Cham­pi­onship.</p>
    <p>The 27-year-old from Seoul fired a five-un­der 65, in­clud­ing an event record-ty­ing 29 for the front nine, to stand on four-un­der 136 af­ter 36 holes at Aron­imink in New­town Square, Penn­syl­va­nia.</p>
    <p>“Just strate­gis­ing to at­tack the greens. I’d try to land it a lit­tle short so I can have some re­lease,” she said. “I didn’t look at the leader­board. I had good mo­men­tum so I just wanted to ride on that.”</p>
    <p>The sev­enth-ranked Kim has had six top-five Ma­jor fin­ishes with­out a vic­tory, her clos­est calls be­ing a run­ner-up fin­ish at the 2015 Women’s PGA and a share of sec­ond at the 2018 Evian Cham­pi­onship.</p>
    <p>Asked if she felt ready for a Ma­jor win, she said: “It’s al­ways my goal.”</p>
    <p>Lurk­ing one stroke back were Spain’s Car­lota Ci­ganda (69), Swe­den’s Anna Nordqvist (68) and Amer­i­cans Danielle Kang (69) and Jen­nifer Kup­cho (65).</p>
    <p>Malaysia’s Kelly Tan, who shared the first-round lead with Amer­i­can Brit­tany Lin­ci­come (72), fired a 71 for a share of sixth.</p>
    <p>Kim be­gan on the back nine and made bo­geys at Nos. 11 and 12 to stumble back, but she an­swered with a birdie at the par-five 16th hole, then opened and closed the front nine with birdies around a run of four con­sec­u­tive birdies start­ing with a 30-foot putt at the par-four fourth.</p>
    <p>“That re­ally helped me with mo­men­tum and fin­ish­ing strong,” she said.</p>
    <p>“The wind fluc­tu­ated on the back nine, so I strug­gled with my iron game. But, when we en­tered the front nine, the wind slowed down and it was eas­ier to at­tack with my irons.”</p>
    <p>World No. 3 Kang an­swered a bo­gey at the fourth with a birdie at the par-three fifth, then fol­lowed a bo­gey at the par-three eighth with a birdie at the par-four 12th and birdied the par-five 16th to match the lead­ers.</p>
    <p>“There are a lot of op­por­tu­ni­ties that I gave my­self but I didn’t cap­i­talise on them,” she said. “But I made some good up-and-downs and some good birdies.”</p>
    <p>Amer­ica world No. 2 Nelly Korda with­drew af­ter an open­ing 71 due to a back in­jury.</p>
    <p>South Korean Lee Mi-rim pulled out with an in­jury af­ter nine holes on Fri­day.</p>
