    <p>The K-pop in­dus­try has posted record al­bum sales this year in spite of can­celled tours and stage per­for­mances. Ac­cord­ing to Gaon Music Chart, South Korea’s top 400 al­bums sold 18.08 mil­lion copies in the first half of the year – a 40 per cent jump from last year’s 12.33 mil­lion and the high­est fig­ure since the chart started tal­ly­ing al­bum sales in 2010.</p>
    <p>There is just no stop­ping the K-pop ex­press.</p>
    <p>A record 18 mil­lion K-pop al­bums were sold in the first half of the year, de­spite the can­cel­la­tion of tours and stage per­for­mances as a re­sult of the coro­n­avirus pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Korea Music Con­tent As­so­ci­a­tion’s Gaon Music Chart, which tab­u­lates the weekly pop­u­lar­ity of songs or al­bums in South Korea, re­ported that the coun­try’s top 400 al­bums sold 18.08 mil­lion copies in the first half of the year, up more than 40 per cent from last year’s 12.33 mil­lion.</p>
    <p>This is also the high­est fig­ure since the chart started tal­ly­ing al­bum sales in 2010.</p>
    <p>The top 10 al­bums – by pop­u­lar groups and solo acts like BTS, Sev­en­teen and Twice – ex­ceeded a com­bined 10 mil­lion copies sold.</p>
    <p>BTS’ Map Of The Soul: 7 was tops, with more than 4.2 mil­lion copies sold. A best-sell­ing al­bum in the United States, it also topped Bri­tain’s Of­fi­cial Charts and Ja­pan’s Ori­con chart.</p>
    <p>Sev­en­teen’s sev­enth mini al­bum, Heng:garae, came in sec­ond at over 1.2 mil­lion copies, driven by growth in Ja­pan.</p>
    <p>Ja­pan re­mains one of the ma­jor mar­kets for K-pop, ac­count­ing for about 60 per cent of its ex­ports.</p>
    <p>In a list dom­i­nated by groups, solo act EXO vo­cal­ist Baekhyun stood out with his re­lease De­light, which was just shy of a mil­lion, with more than 970,000 copies sold.</p>
    <p>Gaon chief re­searcher Kim Jin-woo said that “al­bum sales have been driven heav­ily by K-pop acts with a strong over­seas pres­ence and big in­ter­na­tional fan­doms, as the do­mes­tic mar­ket has reached near sat­u­ra­tion”.</p>
    <p>He added: “Iron­i­cally, the can­cel­la­tion of con­certs and fan meet-ups due to the pan­demic seems to have aided K-pop al­bum sales be­cause the fans didn’t have any other choice... buy­ing al­bums was the only way to show sup­port for a while.”</p>
