    <p>The High Court up­held a short de­ten­tion or­der handed down last year to a for­mer Sin­ga­pore Man­age­ment Univer­sity grad­u­ate for film­ing a wo­man in the toi­let. Such an or­der has a de­ter­rent and re­tribu­tive ef­fect, even though it is a com­mu­nity-based sen­tenc­ing op­tion, said the judge.</p>
    <p>The High Court yes­ter­day up­held a short de­ten­tion or­der handed down last year to a Sin­ga­pore Man­age­ment Univer­sity (SMU) grad­u­ate for film­ing a wo­man in the toi­let.</p>
    <p>Dis­miss­ing the pros­e­cu­tion’s ap­peal for an eight-week jail term, Judge of Ap­peal Tay Yong Kwang said that a short de­ten­tion or­der meant that Hoon Qi Tong, now 25, still has to go to prison for 14 days.</p>
    <p>Such an or­der has a de­ter­rent and re­tribu­tive ef­fect, even though it is a com­mu­nity-based sen­tenc­ing op­tion, said the judge.</p>
    <p>Jus­tice Tay noted that Hoon, who has grad­u­ated and has an of­fice job, was also or­dered to per­form 130 hours of com­mu­nity ser­vice.</p>
    <p>The judge said this would help in re­ha­bil­i­ta­tion by mak­ing Hoon con­trib­ute to the good of so­ci­ety “while serv­ing as a con­stant re­minder to him that he has done wrong and must change”.</p>
    <p>He pointed out that if Hoon breaches the com­mu­nity ser­vice or­der, he can be re-sen­tenced for the of­fence.</p>
    <p>Jus­tice Tay called it a “dif­fi­cult case” in which the right bal­ance had to be achieved be­tween the con­flict­ing in­ter­ests of a vic­tim who was badly af­fected by the in­va­sion of her pri­vacy and the re­ha­bil­i­ta­tion of an of­fender who had taken steps to change.</p>
    <p>The court heard that after his ar­rest, Hoon sought help from the Sex and Love Ad­dicts Anony­mous Sin­ga­pore as­so­ci­a­tion and the Na­tional Ad­dic­tions Man­age­ment Ser­vice at the In­sti­tute of Men­tal Health.</p>
    <p>On Sept 13, 2017, Hoon, then 23 and a third-year fi­nance stu­dent on an in­tern­ship, fol­lowed his 31-yearold col­league to the toi­let when she left her desk.</p>
    <p>He went into the cu­bi­cle next to the one she was us­ing, and po­si­tioned his mo­bile phone over the par­ti­tion to film her.</p>
    <p>When she looked up and saw the phone, she im­me­di­ately dressed her­self and con­fronted Hoon.</p>
    <p>She told him to delete the video, and he for­mat­ted his phone and</p>
    <p>Jus­tice Tay called it a “dif­fi­cult case” in which the right bal­ance had to be achieved be­tween the con­flict­ing in­ter­ests of a vic­tim who was badly af­fected by the in­va­sion of her pri­vacy and the re­ha­bil­i­ta­tion of an of­fender who had taken steps to change... After his ar­rest, Hoon sought help from the Sex and Love Ad­dicts Anony­mous Sin­ga­pore as­so­ci­a­tion and the Na­tional Ad­dic­tions Man­age­ment Ser­vice.</p>
    <p>erased all the data.</p>
    <p>On Feb 11 last year, Hoon pleaded guilty to a charge of in­sult­ing a wo­man’s mod­esty.</p>
    <p>Var­i­ous re­ports were called, and he was found suit­able for pro­ba­tion.</p>
    <p>On Dec 19 last year, a dis­trict judge or­dered him to be de­tained in prison for 14 days and to per­form 130 hours of com­mu­nity ser­vice.</p>
    <p>The pros­e­cu­tion filed an ap­peal against the sen­tence the next day.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, Deputy Pub­lic Pros­e­cu­tor Ter­ence Chua ar­gued that a com­mu­nity-based sen­tence was not jus­ti­fied for an adult who com­mit­ted a pre­med­i­tated and “highly in­tru­sive” sex­ual of­fence.</p>
    <p>He said the in­ci­dent left an in­deli­ble mark on the vic­tim, who is now fear­ful when us­ing a pub­lic toi­let.</p>
    <p>Hoon’s lawyer, Mr Mark Lee, ar­gued that a short de­ten­tion or­der car­ries a puni­tive and de­ter­rent el­e­ment.</p>
    <p>Jus­tice Tay said that Hoon’s be­hav­iour was more op­por­tunis­tic than pre­med­i­tated, when com­pared with a past case in which the of­fender in­stalled a mini-cam­era on his shoe to take up­skirt videos and planted a hid­den cam­era in the toi­let.</p>
    <p>Hoon started serv­ing his de­ten­tion after the hear­ing.</p>
