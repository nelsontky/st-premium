    <p>Two ho­tels at Re­sorts World Sen­tosa have been barred from ac­cept­ing new book­ings for a month from to­day, for fail­ing to fol­low safe dis­tanc­ing mea­sures.</p>
    <p>The Sin­ga­pore Tourism Board (STB) said in a state­ment yes­ter­day that the sus­pen­sions for Beach Vil­las and Equar­ius Ho­tel will last till Jan 21. The ho­tels can still ful­fil ex­ist­ing book­ings.</p>
    <p>As at yes­ter­day, 10 ho­tels and hos­tels have been fined for breach­ing safe man­age­ment mea­sures, such as by fail­ing to con­duct en­try screen­ing or record con­tact de­tails of guests who en­tered their premises, said STB.</p>
    <p>Its en­force­ment of­fi­cers found at least 15 in­di­vid­u­als had gath­ered in a two-storey villa in Beach Vil­las on Oct 10, though the book­ing was made un­der four in­di­vid­u­als.</p>
    <p>Of the 15 peo­ple, only four were reg­is­tered as guests with the ho­tel.</p>
    <p>Cur­rent safe man­age­ment mea­sures re­strict gath­er­ings to not more than five in­di­vid­u­als in any guest rooms, un­less they are all from the same house­hold.</p>
    <p>STB also found that the ho­tel did not take steps to con­duct en­try screen­ing like tem­per­a­ture checks of the in­di­vid­u­als.</p>
    <p>It also did not im­ple­ment SafeEn­try to en­sure they had checked in for con­tact trac­ing.</p>
    <p>Sep­a­rately, on Nov 17, STB en­force­ment of­fi­cers found that Equar­ius Ho­tel did not pre­vent a gath­er­ing of 16 peo­ple in one of its guest rooms.</p>
    <p>The room had been booked un­der the names of three of the 16 in­di­vid­u­als.</p>
    <p>The ho­tel had failed to de­ploy staff at en­try points to en­sure the in­di­vid­u­als would check in via SafeEn­try, did not take their tem­per­a­tures, and did not en­sure that no more than five peo­ple were gath­ered in the same guest room, said STB.</p>
    <p>“Fur­ther in­ves­ti­ga­tions of the two ho­tels and in­di­vid­u­als in­volved are un­der way, and en­force­ment ac­tions may be taken,” the agency added.</p>
    <p>Un­der the Covid-19 (Tem­po­rary Mea­sures) Act, first-time of­fend­ers can be fined up to $10,000 or jailed up to six months, or both.</p>
    <p>Re­peat of­fend­ers may be fined up to $20,000 or jailed up to 12 months, or both.</p>
    <p>“STB takes a se­ri­ous view of any breach in safe man­age­ment mea­sures and will not hes­i­tate to take en­force­ment ac­tion for non-com­pli­ance,” said the agency.</p>
    <p>STB had in­tro­duced ad­di­tional safe man­age­ment mea­sures on Dec 1, fol­low­ing sev­eral breaches and in view of the fes­tive pe­riod.</p>
    <p>Th­ese in­clude en­sur­ing that ev­ery vis­i­tor to a guest room is pre­reg­is­tered by the guest prior to ar­rival, and that vis­i­tor en­try into guest rooms is mon­i­tored, such as via vis­i­tor passes or staff sta­tioned at lob­bies.</p>
    <p>The ho­tels and hos­tels pre­vi­ously fined for breach­ing safe man­age­ment mea­sures are: Crowne Plaza Changi Air­port, Fu­rama RiverFront Sin­ga­pore, Gap Year Hostel, Ho­tel 1887, Ho­tel Supreme, Kim Tian Ho­tel (Han), One De­gree 15 Ma­rina Club, ST Sig­na­ture Jalan Be­sar, ST Sig­na­ture Tan­jong Pa­gar and Thad’s Bou­tique Hostel.</p>
    <p>As at yes­ter­day, 10 ho­tels and hos­tels have been fined for breach­ing safe man­age­ment mea­sures, such as by fail­ing to con­duct en­try screen­ing or record con­tact de­tails of guests that en­tered their premises, said the Sin­ga­pore Tourism Board.</p>
