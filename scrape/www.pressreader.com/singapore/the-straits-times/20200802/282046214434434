    <p>NEW YORK • US Open or­gan­is­ers have full con­fi­dence i n their safety plans a month before the hard-court Grand Slam starts, even as the coron­avirus pan­demic wors­ens across the United States.</p>
    <p>The US Ten­nis As­so­ci­a­tion (USTA) said on Fri­day it is “con­tin­u­ing its plans to stage the US Open” as well as the Western & South­ern Open tune-up event the week before.</p>
    <p>“We re­main con­fi­dent that our top pri­or­ity, the health and safety of all in­volved in both tour­na­ments, re­mains on track,” an of­fi­cial state­ment read.</p>
    <p>But ex­actly what those health and safety de­tails are re­mains un­known, with the Ma­jor set to be­gin be­hind closed doors on Aug 31 in a “bub­ble” quar­an­tine set­ting at the Na­tional Ten­nis Centre.</p>
    <p>The USTA has said it will re­lease de­tails of its health and safety plans “at a later date closer to the tour­na­ments”, point­ing out it has worked with both the ATP and WTA Tours to cover all the bases.</p>
    <p>Top-ranked No­vak Djokovic and world No. 2 Rafael Nadal have en­tered the Western and South­ern Open, but have yet to con­firm their at­ten­dance at the US Open.</p>
    <p>For­mer women’s No. 1s Ser­ena Wil­liams and Naomi Osaka have com­mit­ted to play­ing in the US Open, but top-ranked Ash­leigh Barty will skip it over Covid-19 fears. New York was the first ma­jor US hot spot for the virus, with con­di­tions so se­vere that a tem­po­rary hos­pi­tal was es­tab­lished on the grounds of the US Ten­nis Centre in March.</p>
    <p>But cases have been at a more man­age­able level in re­cent months, although it re­mains a con­cern that peo­ple vis­it­ing from other out­break ar­eas across the country could pre­cip­i­tate another spike in in­fec­tions.</p>
    <p>The USTA has, how­ever, i nsisted that the risk of con­tract­ing Covid-19 will be min­i­mal as long as there is strict ad­her­ence to the “bub­ble” pro­to­cols in place.</p>
    <p>“Work­ing with our med­i­cal ad­vi­sory group and se­cu­rity team and the state of New York, we have de­vel­oped a strong health and safety plan to mit­i­gate the risk of in­fec­tion within the con­tained en­vi­ron­ment com­prised of the tour­na­ment site and player ho­tels,” it said.</p>
    <p>“New York state con­tin­ues to be one of the safest places in the country as it re­lates to t he Covid-19 virus.”</p>
