    <p>LON­DON • Olympic qual­i­fi­ca­tion for the marathon and road race walk events can re-start from Sept 1, three months ear­lier than pre­vi­ously an­nounced, the sport’s gov­ern­ing body World Ath­let­ics ruled on Tues­day.</p>
    <p>How­ever, qual­i­fy­ing for all other track and field events at next year’s Tokyo Games would re­main suspended un­til Nov 30 as orig­i­nally planned, it said in a state­ment.</p>
    <p>Qual­i­fi­ca­tion was put on hold in April due to the coron­avirus pan­demic which has caused the Games to be post­poned for one year.</p>
    <p>World Ath­let­ics pres­i­dent Se­bas­tian Coe said the change was needed for road ath­letes due to a lack of qual­i­fy­ing op­por­tu­ni­ties.</p>
    <p>“Most of the ma­jor marathons have al­ready been can­celled or post­poned for the re­main­der of this year and the evo­lu­tion of the pan­demic makes it dif­fi­cult to pre­dict if those sched­uled for the first half of next year will be able to go ahead.</p>
    <p>“That sit­u­a­tion, com­bined with the fact that en­durance ath­letes in the marathon and race walks can only pro­duce a very lim­ited num­ber of high-qual­ity per­for­mances a year, would re­ally nar­row their qual­i­fy­ing win­dow with­out this ad­just­ment,” he said.</p>
    <p>Or­gan­is­ers of the Lon­don Marathon, due to take place on Oct 4, were pre­pared to help ath­letes travel to the event to achieve an Olympic qual­i­fy­ing time, World Ath­let­ics said.</p>
    <p>It was also work­ing with or­gan­is­ers of the Abu Dhabi marathon, sched­uled for Dec 11, to see if they could of­fer sim­i­lar op­por­tu­ni­ties, and hoped there would be at least two race-walk­ing events be­tween Septem­ber and Novem­ber.</p>
