    <p>Na­tion­al­ist sen­ti­ments are be­ing in­jected into sci­en­tific de­bates about the ap­proval process for the Covid-19 vaccine. Global af­fairs cor­re­spon­dent Jonathan Eyal looks at how this is stok­ing the rise of anti-vax sen­ti­ments.</p>
    <p>Bri­tain’s race to be­come the first coun­try to ap­prove a coro­n­avirus vaccine has not been well re­ceived around the world.</p>
    <p>“You know, I love the Brits; they’re great, they are good sci­en­tists,” said Dr An­thony Fauci, the lead­ing US in­fec­tious dis­ease spe­cial­ist. “But they just took the data from the Pfizer (phar­ma­ceu­ti­cal) com­pany and in­stead of scru­ti­n­is­ing it re­ally, re­ally care­fully, they just said okay let us ap­prove it. That’s it. And they went with it.”</p>
    <p>The Euro­peans were hardly more com­pli­men­tary. In an un­usu­ally blunt state­ment, the Eu­ro­pean Medicines Agency (EMA), which is in charge of ap­prov­ing Covid-19 vac­cines for the Eu­ro­pean Union, pointed out that its de­ci­sion not to ap­prove any vaccine be­fore at least the end of this month was much more pru­dent for, it claimed, it is based on more ev­i­dence and re­quires more checks than the emer­gency pro­ce­dure sup­pos­edly cho­sen by Bri­tain.</p>
    <p>Dr Fauci sub­se­quently apol­o­gised for what he said, claim­ing that he never in­tended to sug­gest that the Bri­tish vaccine ap­proval sys­tem was some­how de­fi­cient. But the Euro­peans re­mained un­re­pen­tant in their crit­i­cism.</p>
    <p>And Rus­sia pounced on this de­bate in its own inim­itable way, by seek­ing to beat the Brits at their own game: it launched its own im­mu­ni­sa­tion pro­gramme with even less in­for­ma­tion about the safety of its own lo­cally man­u­fac­tured vaccine, just so that it could claim the crown of be­ing the first in the world.</p>
    <p>Viewed in iso­la­tion, this dis­pute can be put down to just silly na­tion­al­ism, a child­ish at­tempt to claim pri­macy.</p>
    <p>A MULTI-FRONT FIGHT FOR CRED­I­BIL­ITY</p>
    <p>Nonethe­less, there is a se­ri­ous side to this episode, for it rep­re­sents just the first skir­mish in a much big­ger war which needs to be fought for the cred­i­bil­ity of the coro­n­avirus vac­cines against dis­in­for­ma­tion cam­paigns and the armies of con­spir­acy the­o­rists world­wide de­ter­mined to dis­credit the en­tire ef­fort.</p>
    <p>First, let’s take a deeper look into the ap­par­ent sur­prise sprung by the Bri­tish gov­ern­ment’s Medicines and Health­care Prod­ucts Reg­u­la­tory Agency (MHRA) last Wed­nes­day, when it sud­denly an­nounced that the vaccine by Pfizer and BioNTech had been given ap­proval for dis­tri­bu­tion.</p>
    <p>This was done us­ing an es­tab­lished process known as a “rolling re­view”, a reg­u­la­tory regime de­vised par­tic­u­larly for pub­lic health emer­gen­cies. What this en­tails is that in­stead of wait­ing un­til a phar­ma­ceu­ti­cal com­pany has com­pleted all its re­search and tests, Bri­tain’s MHRA re­ceives in­di­vid­ual “packages” of data from the phar­ma­ceu­ti­cal com­pany as they be­come avail­able, on a stag­gered ba­sis, al­low­ing it to reach a con­clu­sion whether the vaccine is ef­fi­ca­cious and safe much ear­lier.</p>
    <p>No­body claims that this should be the stan­dard ap­proval pro­ce­dure. But with over 50,000 peo­ple dead and hun­dreds more dy­ing daily and with the coun­try’s econ­omy at a stand­still for much of this year, a good case can be made that the ac­cel­er­ated pro­ce­dure was worth at­tempt­ing.</p>
    <p>What is more dif­fi­cult to claim, how­ever, is that Bri­tain was sloppy in its ap­proach, or that the coun­try’s reg­u­la­tory agency is low­er­ing safety stan­dards.</p>
    <p>It is worth point­ing out that the EMA – which now claims to be so con­cerned about the Bri­tish rush to ap­prove a vaccine – used to be based in Lon­don un­til last year; it moved out of the Bri­tish cap­i­tal only be­cause of Bri­tain’s de­ci­sion to leave the Eu­ro­pean Union. And when it was in Lon­don, the EMA used to sub-con­tract about a third of its own safety and su­per­vi­sory work to none other than Bri­tain’s MHRA.</p>
    <p>It is non­sense to sug­gest that the very same group of Bri­tish reg­u­la­tors who un­til re­cently were trusted with en­sur­ing the med­i­cal safety of the rest of the Eu­ro­pean con­ti­nent have sud­denly “gone rogue”. And it may also be ap­pro­pri­ate to re­call that the EMA also re­ceived the same data the Bri­tish re­ceived from Pfizer on a rolling ba­sis.</p>
    <p>What does this episode tell us? That what is es­sen­tially a per­fectly re­spectable and proper sci­en­tific dis­pute about the bal­ance be­tween safety and speed in ap­prov­ing vac­cines can eas­ily be hi­jacked by politi­cians and nar­row, na­tion­al­ist con­sid­er­a­tions.</p>
    <p>The claim by a Bri­tish min­is­ter that his coun­try had se­cured the first coro­n­avirus vaccine ap­proval glob­ally be­cause Bri­tain is “a much bet­ter coun­try” than its ri­vals was not only silly but down­right of­fen­sive.</p>
    <p>How­ever, the re­sponse from some Eu­ro­pean politi­cians and leg­is­la­tors who, ea­ger to de­flect crit­i­cism in their own home states as to why they will not move faster, rushed to ac­cuse Bri­tain of low­er­ing safety stan­dards was not help­ful ei­ther.</p>
    <p>Sadly, few of th­ese spar­ring politi­cians ap­pear to have con­sid­ered what will be their big­gest prob­lem in the months to come: per­suad­ing their na­tions to ac­cept the vac­cines.</p>
    <p>BAD OMENS</p>
    <p>For a va­ri­ety of long­stand­ing le­gal con­sid­er­a­tions, very few Western na­tions have com­pul­sory vac­ci­na­tion laws. Fur­ther­more, there is no mod­ern prece­dent for the mass vac­ci­na­tion pro­gramme which is now be­ing en­vis­aged. And the omens are not good. Ac­cord­ing to a study car­ried out in Septem­ber by the World Eco­nomic Fo­rum and the Ipsos opinion poll­sters, of ap­prox­i­mately 20,000 adults in 27 coun­tries around the world, the United King­dom ap­pears to be the coun­try in Europe with the largest share of its pop­u­la­tion – 85 per cent – say­ing they are ready to be vac­ci­nated against the Covid-19 virus.</p>
    <p>But in Ger­many, which un­til re­cently had a sim­i­lar ac­cep­tance fig­ure as Bri­tain’s, the num­ber of anti-vaxxers – as the anti-vaccine ac­tivists are com­monly re­ferred to – has in­creased ex­po­nen­tially. Ac­cord­ing to a sur­vey com­mis­sioned by the coun­try’s na­tional broad­caster last month, up to 29 per cent of the Ger­man pub­lic will refuse to be vac­ci­nated.</p>
    <p>In Spain, a coun­try which has one of the high­est vac­ci­na­tion rates in Europe (95 per cent) even though no vaccine is com­pul­sory, a sur­vey by the Car­los III Health In­sti­tute – one of the coun­try’s lead­ing es­tab­lish­ments – in­di­cated that only 70 per cent of the pop­u­la­tion was now ready to be vac­ci­nated.</p>
    <p>And the poorer east­ern part of the con­ti­nent is a dis­as­ter in this re­spect. Just un­der half of the peo­ple of Poland, the re­gion’s big­gest state, would con­sider the vaccine, while in Ro­ma­nia, only one in three is ready to ac­cept the jab.</p>
    <p>And then there is of course the United States, where anti-vaxxers are most prom­i­nent. The lat­est con­spir­acy the­ory pushed there claims that the vac­cines de­vel­oped in Europe will trans­mit bar­codes to the gov­ern­ment and trans­form any per­son vac­ci­nated into a “slave for the sys­tem”.</p>
    <p>A va­ri­ety of ex­pla­na­tions ac­count for this non­sense.</p>
    <p>A PUB­LIC IN­FOR­MA­TION CHAL­LENGE</p>
    <p>First among them is the greater avail­abil­ity of elec­tronic me­dia out­lets, al­low­ing ev­ery crack­pot to push his or her views. The In­ter­net is a great leveller, so the web­site of some­one ped­dling a con­spir­acy the­ory can look iden­ti­cal to that of a re­spectable news­pa­per or even a gov­ern­ment reg­u­la­tory agency.</p>
    <p>An­other contributi­ng fac­tor is that at a time when pub­lic in­ter­est in viruses, dis­eases and medicines has never been higher, it is dif­fi­cult for jour­nal­ists and es­tab­lished me­dia plat­forms to re­port ac­cu­rately such mat­ters: nei­ther the jour­nal­ists nor their read­ers are med­i­cal ex­perts, so even well-in­formed and well-in­ten­tioned me­dia re­ports of­ten amount to an over-sim­pli­fi­ca­tion.</p>
    <p>One such ex­am­ple are re­ports about the pos­si­bil­ity of be­ing re­in­fected with Covid-19; many of th­ese cases were un­sub­stan­ti­ated or sci­en­tif­i­cally un­ver­i­fied, yet even the most rep­utable me­dia out­lets re­ported them, and of­ten with­out ex­plain­ing that the clin­i­cal value of the re­ports re­mains de­bat­able.</p>
    <p>There are also some un­for­tu­nate ex­pe­ri­ences from past mass in­oc­u­la­tion cam­paigns which weigh heav­ily on peo­ple’s minds. Take, for in­stance, the story of Swe­den, where a decade ago 5.3 mil­lion peo­ple – roughly 60 per cent of the na­tion – were vac­ci­nated against the H1N1 flu virus. A few months af­ter­wards, there was a sharp in­crease in nar­colepsy, a se­ri­ous sleep dis­or­der which only later was recog­nised as a po­ten­tial side ef­fect of the vaccine used. Of course, this should have ab­so­lutely noth­ing to do with the cur­rent Covid-19 vaccine. But try ex­plain­ing it to the Swedes.</p>
    <p>And then there is the deeply politi­cised na­ture of the cur­rent pan­demic, the fact that politi­cians know that their ca­reers de­pend on the way they han­dle the health cri­sis.</p>
    <p>US Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump led this process by of­ten pre­tend­ing that the pan­demic was made worse by his Demo­crat op­po­nents.</p>
    <p>How­ever, Pres­i­dent-elect Joe Bi­den is not ex­actly blame-free of play­ing pol­i­tics with health is­sues ei­ther. For, while claim­ing that there are “no blue states or red states, but only the United States” – a ref­er­ence to the colours of Amer­ica’s two ma­jor po­lit­i­cal par­ties – Mr Bi­den also of­ten adds that Repub­li­can-led states have fared worse in the pan­demic than Demo­crat-led ones. It is not sur­pris­ing, there­fore, that ac­cep­tance of vac­cines in the US now in­creas­ingly mir­rors po­lit­i­cal af­fil­i­a­tions.</p>
    <p>HOW TO FIGHT BACK</p>
    <p>What can be done? Ac­tively com­bat­ing – rather than sim­ply ig­nor­ing – the ped­dlers of con­spir­acy the­o­ries is es­sen­tial, for such the­o­ries cause real dam­age.</p>
    <p>A study just com­pleted by Pro­fes­sor Heidi Lar­son of the Lon­don School of Hy­giene and Trop­i­cal Medicine in­di­cates that when sub­jected to con­spir­acy the­o­ries, up to 7 per cent of Bri­tish peo­ple who orig­i­nally in­tended to take the vaccine change their minds.</p>
    <p>So, tak­ing this non­sense down as soon as pos­si­ble will save lives; Face­book’s com­mit­ment to do pre­cisely that is wel­come.</p>
    <p>Mov­ing fast on vac­ci­na­tions also seems es­sen­tial. Sur­veys from Spain in­di­cate that up to 40 per cent of those who cur­rently hes­i­tate to be vac­ci­nated could be per­suaded if the vaccine were made avail­able “im­me­di­ately”.</p>
    <p>And be­ing hon­est with the pub­lic is crit­i­cal. In this re­spect, French Pres­i­dent Em­manuel Macron’s re­cent prom­ise to “share at each stage all the in­for­ma­tion, in­clud­ing what we know and what we do not know” about the vaccine should serve as an ex­am­ple.</p>
    <p>But above all else, govern­ments should de­sist from play­ing po­lit­i­cal games with the vaccine. Just look at the fate of Hun­gary, a coun­try whose prime min­is­ter de­cided, largely for po­lit­i­cal rea­sons, to adopt the Rus­sian vaccine Sput­nik-V.</p>
    <p>Since Rus­sia is hardly fa­mous in Europe for the qual­ity or safety of its prod­ucts, the only out­come of this de­ci­sion has been that over half of the pop­u­la­tion of Hun­gary now say they are not ready to be in­oc­u­lated, and only 7 per cent are look­ing for­ward to re­ceiv­ing a jab made in Rus­sia.</p>
    <p>Un­fair to Rus­sian sci­en­tists? Per­haps. But a cau­tion­ary tale of what hap­pens when pol­i­tics re­places sci­ence.</p>
