    <p>Vet­eran track and field coach Loh Siang Piow was yesterday sen­tenced to 21 months’ jail for mo­lest­ing a teenage ath­lete twice in 2013.</p>
    <p>The 75-year-old, bet­ter known in the sports fra­ter­nity as Loh Chan Pew, was last month found guilty of us­ing crim­i­nal force on the fe­male ath­lete when she was 18, by rub­bing her gen­i­tals on two oc­ca­sions while mas­sag­ing the back of her thighs.</p>
    <p>Loh ap­peared ex­pres­sion­less as the sen­tence was an­nounced, and is ex­pected to file an ap­peal.</p>
    <p>Dis­trict Judge Marvin Bay said: “There was a deeply egre­gious abuse of trust here. Young trainees are placed in the care of coaches with the le­git­i­mate ex­pec­ta­tion by the trainees, their par­ents and the pub­lic at large that they will be pro­tected from harm or ex­ploita­tion.”</p>
    <p>Both in­ci­dents were said to have hap­pened at the old Tampines Sta­dium on two Sun­days be­tween Jan­uary and March 17 in 2013.</p>
    <p>The girl lodged a po­lice re­port against Loh on July 30, 2016.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing the trial, which be­gan in 2018, the court heard that Loh touched the vic­tim’s groin over her tights as she lay on a bench dur­ing a mas­sage after a pri­vate train­ing ses­sion.</p>
    <p>At an­other ses­sion, Loh was said to have rubbed her gen­i­tals over her tights dur­ing the mas­sage and told her to “just re­lax” when she told him to stop.</p>
    <p>Judge Bay said the sen­tence for the sec­ond charge must be sig­nif­i­cantly heav­ier than that for the first charge, given that it in­volved a “com­par­a­tively pro­longed event” and “ex­ten­sive and repet­i­tive in­tru­sion of the vic­tim’s vagi­nal area”.</p>
    <p>The girl sub­mit­ted an im­pact state­ment, which was read out to the court. She said in the state­ment that the ex­pe­ri­ence of go­ing to trial was “a hun­dred times more tor­tur­ous than the ex­pe­ri­ence it­self”.</p>
    <p>“I thought speak­ing up would be the right thing to do. I never imag­ined that this would turn into such a night­mare,” she added. “I hope more can be done to pro­tect vic­tims of sex­ual as­sault who speak up.”</p>
    <p>Deputy Pub­lic Prose­cu­tor Gail Wong had ear­lier urged the court to jail Loh for at least 24 months for both charges, cit­ing fac­tors in­clud­ing abuse of au­thor­ity and trust, pre­med­i­ta­tion and a “patent lack of re­morse” on Loh’s part.</p>
    <p>She also stressed the im­por­tance of the sen­tence re­flect­ing the need for de­ter­rence.</p>
    <p>In mit­i­ga­tion, de­fence lawyer Vic­tor Lee high­lighted his client’s oth­er­wise good char­ac­ter and med­i­cal con­di­tions, among other fac­tors, and sought a jail term of five to six months for the first charge and seven to 10 months for the sec­ond, with both to run con­cur­rently.</p>
    <p>Loh, pre­vi­ously deputy su­per­in­ten­dent of prisons, was a former na­tional sprinter and coach of 35 years. He also used to be a vice-pres­i­dent of Sin­ga­pore Athletics, which gov­erns the sport here.</p>
    <p>Judge Bay noted Loh’s med­i­cal con­di­tions, and ex­pressed con­fi­dence that the pri­son med­i­cal ser­vices will pro­vide a high level of care in manag­ing th­ese con­di­tions.</p>
    <p>For each charge of out­rage of mod­esty, he could have been jailed for up to two years and/or fined. He can­not be caned as he is more than 50 years old.</p>
