    <p>Korean-Amer­i­can au­thor Kat Cho grew up with myths of gob­lins, reapers and nine-tailed fox spir­its, but it was her love for South Korean dra­mas that helped her turn these folk­tales into best-sell­ing young adult (YA) nov­els.</p>
    <p>“My par­ents had bought my sis­ter and me a cou­ple of Korean folk­tale books,” says Cho, 34, over Skype from Brook­lyn. “But it was some­thing that I never re­ally thought I could talk to other people about, be­cause the im­agery and cul­ture weren’t very fa­mil­iar to my friends who weren’t Korean.”</p>
    <p>K-dra­mas, es­pe­cially those that take tra­di­tions and twist them as mod­ern-day retellings, showed her oth­er­wise.</p>
    <p>Cho burst onto the YA fan­tasy scene last year with her de­but novel Gu­miho: Wicked Fox, about Gu Miy­oung, a teenager in mod­ern-day Seoul who is se­cretly a gu­miho, or nine-tailed fox, who must suck out a man’s life force ev­ery full moon to sur­vive.</p>
    <p>Mi-young tries to kill only men guilty of ter­ri­ble crimes and keeps a low pro­file, until she saves the life of a boy, Ji-hoon, and falls in love with him, de­fy­ing the will of her cen­turies-old mother.</p>
    <p>Cho re­cently re­leased her se­cond novel, Dokkaebi: Vi­cious Spir­its, which spent three weeks on The Straits Times best­seller list.</p>
    <p>In it, Ji-hoon’s prag­matic best friend So-min must band to­gether with Junu, a dash­ing, amoral dokkaebi, or gob­lin, whom she dis­likes, to re­pair a rift be­tween the worlds of the liv­ing and the dead.</p>
    <p>On a fam­ily va­ca­tion to Seoul, Cho was struck by the mix of old and new. “I loved how, in one neigh­bour­hood, you’re around these hanok (old Korean houses) and the old palace, and then you walk a block in the other di­rec­tion and you’re in this bustling high-rise me­trop­o­lis.”</p>
    <p>“It made me think what a crea­ture who’s lived through­out Korean his­tory would feel about the city and how it’s changed. I im­me­di­ately thought of the gu­miho, and then I just ran with the idea from there.”</p>
    <p>Her book Dokkaebi may seem to have some affin­ity with Gob­lin, the 2017 smash-hit K-drama star­ring Gong Yoo as the tit­u­lar im­mor­tal.</p>
    <p>Cho says she had al­ready out­lined her duol­ogy for her pub­lisher by the time she watched Gob­lin. “I can’t deny that I liked that K-drama,” she ad­mits. It did in­spire her char­ac­ter Hyuk, a reaper who col­lects the souls of the dead and who is some­thing of a friend to Junu i n Dokkaebi.</p>
    <p>Other K-dra­mas she drew on when de­vel­op­ing her nov­els were high school drama School 2013 (2012-2013) and Oh My Ghost (2015), about a chef who is de­scended from a shaman and who gets pos­sessed by a lust­ful ghost.</p>
    <p>She would love to see her books adapted as K-dra­mas, she says. She al­ready has a dream cast that in­cludes Kim Seol-hyun from girl group AOA as Mi-young and Oh My Ghost star Park Bo-young as So-min.</p>
    <p>If there is one thing Cho has learnt from K-dra­mas, it is the im­por­tance of pla­tonic re­la­tion­ships. “Korean cul­ture is all about how you fit in with the greater whole, with your fam­ily, friends and so­ci­ety.</p>
    <p>“K-dra­mas treat fa­mil­ial and pla­tonic re­la­tion­ships as just as im­por­tant as ro­man­tic re­la­tion­ships and I love that they delve deep into how people care about each other.”</p>
