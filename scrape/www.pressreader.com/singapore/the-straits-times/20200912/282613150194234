    <p>Ap­ple’s pres­ence in Sin­ga­pore is a 40-year shape-shift­ing jour­ney cel­e­brat­ing ar­chi­tec­ture, re­tail de­sign and the user ex­pe­ri­ence in its stores.</p>
    <p>As far back as 1981, Ap­ple was among the first global com­pa­nies in Sin­ga­pore to man­u­fac­ture printed cir­cuit boards for Ap­ple II com­put­ers world­wide.</p>
    <p>Its sleek five-storey of­fice and two-storey pro­duc­tion area stood out from con­ven­tional fac­tory build­ings at the time.</p>
    <p>To­day, Ap­ple Ma­rina Bay Sands (MBS) marks the tech gi­ant’s lat­est in­vest­ment in Sin­ga­pore, af­ter its Ang Mo Kio fac­tory, one-north cor­po­rate site and two re­tail stores in Or­chard Road and Jewel Changi Air­port.</p>
    <p>Of­fi­cially un­veiled on Thurs­day, Ap­ple MBS is a gi­ant ge­o­desic dome with an ocu­lus in its ceil­ing, in­spired by the more than 1,800-year-old Pan­theon in Rome – a cel­e­bra­tion of light through in­no­va­tive de­sign.</p>
    <p>The trans­par­ent igloo-like struc­ture is made with 114 pieces of glass and held to­gether by 10 ver­ti­cal stain­less steel “ribs” or mul­lions.</p>
    <p>The bub­ble, which rests on a con­crete foun­da­tion hous­ing its two lower floors, is the world’s first “float­ing” Ap­ple store.</p>
    <p>It is de­signed by global ar­chi­tec­ture stu­dio Foster + Part­ners, which also con­cep­tu­alised the Ap­ple Park head­quar­ters in Cu­per­tino, California, in the United States, and sev­eral flag­ship stores around the world, such as Ap­ple Or­chard Road.</p>
    <p>Ap­ple’s Jewel store, which opened in July last year, has a link to MBS as both in­te­grated mall de­signs were orig­i­nally con­ceived by Cana­di­anIs­raeli ar­chi­tect Moshe Safdie.</p>
    <p>To counter the glare of the trop­i­cal sun stream­ing from all sides into the dome of the float­ing store, Foster + Part­ners ar­chi­tects de­signed con­cen­tric rings or “baf­fles” that get smaller as they reach the ceil­ing of the 30m-wide and 17m-high sphere so that it would not get too hot or bright in­side.</p>
    <p>Each baf­fle not only pro­vides shade but also bounces the light up to the un­der­side of the baf­fle lo­cated just above it.</p>
    <p>Its in­te­rior is a col­umn-free space with a 360-de­gree view of Ma­rina Bay and a cen­tral video wall where events such as To­day At Ap­ple, the free in-store ed­u­ca­tional ses­sions, take cen­tre stage.</p>
    <p>For Sin­ga­pore Polytech­nic graphic de­sign stu­dent Ervin Liyu, the store cer­tainly floats his boat.</p>
    <p>“Ap­ple has al­ways been at the head of the class in all as­pects of de­sign,” says Mr Liyu, 19, who was first in line at the open­ing of the store on Thurs­day, af­ter queue­ing since about 6am.</p>
    <p>“The MBS store is an ar­chi­tec­tural marvel and the idea is truly bril­liant,” says the big Ap­ple fan who started doo­dling Mickey Mouse shapes on his first Ap­ple computer when he was two years old. “I started my creative jour­ney with the Ap­ple iMac G3 and have not looked back since.”</p>
    <p>Ap­ple’s se­nior direc­tor of world­wide re­tail de­sign, Mr Chris Braith­waite, tells The Straits Times that the Ap­ple MBS store rep­re­sents Ap­ple’s syn­ergy with Sin­ga­pore af­ter a nearly 40-year his­tory with the Re­pub­lic.</p>
    <p>“This sim­ple idea of the dome re­quired an ex­tra­or­di­nary de­gree of ex­per­tise and in­no­va­tion and also close col­lab­o­ra­tion with the Ur­ban Re­de­vel­op­ment Au­thor­ity and other gov­ern­ment bod­ies, as well as our land­lord part­ner Sands Cor­po­ra­tion,” he adds.</p>
    <p>Be­fore the raz­zle-daz­zle of the re­tail stores, Ap­ple first moved into a rented man­u­fac­tur­ing fa­cil­ity in Ang Mo Kio in 1981.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to Mr Terry Tay, who was then a part­ner of Ar­chi­tects Team 3, the tech gi­ant later wanted its own fac­tory in Sin­ga­pore and con­ducted a lim­ited de­sign com­pe­ti­tion, which the firm won.</p>
    <p>“The de­sign brief em­bod­ied the com­pany’s phi­los­o­phy: ‘a fac­tory for the peo­ple’,” says Mr Tay, 78, who is now re­tired. “It was re­ally a break­through de­sign for an in­dus­trial fa­cil­ity which set new stan­dards for in­dus­trial de­sign in Sin­ga­pore.”</p>
    <p>He re­calls how Ap­ple’s then direc­tor of Far East op­er­a­tions, Mr John San­ders, ex­plained why the com­pany placed a pre­mium on the work en­vi­ron­ment, where peo­ple could freely in­ter­act, work, play and com­mu­ni­cate at all lev­els. This phi­los­o­phy was car­ried into the to­tal de­sign of the project both ex­ter­nally and in­ter­nally.</p>
    <p>“We cre­ated a build­ing that em­bod­ied a unique char­ac­ter, with an in­te­rior at­mos­phere that pro­duced a good feel­ing for the staff, so that it in­spired them to at­tain higher pro­duc­tiv­ity lev­els at work,” says Mr Tay.</p>
    <p>He adds that the de­sign of the build­ing, which was com­pleted in 1987, was ul­tra-mod­ern and in­no­va­tive. It stood out from its sur­round­ings be­cause of its pre­ci­sion fin­ish­ing, clean mod­u­lar lines and neatly de­tailed and metic­u­lously ex­e­cuted ex­te­rior metal cladding – in short, “just like a well-de­signed Ap­ple prod­uct”.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to Mr Tay, the de­sign of the five-storey of­fice and two­s­torey pro­duc­tion area was far re­moved from the stan­dard fac­tory build­ing tem­plate com­mon in Sin­ga­pore dur­ing the 1970s and 1980s.</p>
    <p>Ap­ple’s de­sign brief was also peo­ple-ori­ented, so it pro­vided for more than just a util­i­tar­ian can­teen for Ap­ple staff, he adds.</p>
    <p>“There was a staff re­lax­ation and in­ter­ac­tion area, a gym, a squash court and a roof gar­den, which were the first of its kind.</p>
    <p>“The grounds were beau­ti­fully land­scaped, and the perime­ter was not bound by fences or walls. There was not even a se­cu­rity guard post – which were oth­er­wise stan­dard re­quire­ments for fac­tory build­ings,” says Mr Tay.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to Mr Braith­waite, Ap­ple and Sin­ga­pore’s evo­lu­tion since the 1980s has been “re­mark­able”. With the new MBS store, the tech gi­ant wanted to live up to the ex­pec­ta­tion of that con­tin­u­ing de­vel­op­ment.</p>
    <p>“The un­veil­ing we have be­gun and which we will be con­tin­u­ing re­ally rep­re­sents the di­verse imag­i­na­tions of Sin­ga­pore­ans,” says Mr Braith­waite.</p>
    <p>“We wanted to cap­ture that dy­namic move­ment and colours of the wa­ter in Ma­rina Bay, which also sig­nify the con­tin­u­ous flow of ideas and pas­sions in Sin­ga­pore.”</p>
