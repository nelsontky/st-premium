    <p>De­mand for su­per­mar­ket house brand items has soared amid the eco­nomic slow­down, as con­sumers tighten their purse strings and gro­cers ex­pand their cut-price of­fer­ings be­yond daily es­sen­tials.</p>
    <p>Dairy Farm Group’s Mead­ows brand, which was launched last month, has be­come the most pop­u­lar brand in Gi­ant su­per­mar­kets, beat­ing lead­ing names such as Nescafe and Coca-Cola, the com­pany said yes­ter­day. Mead­ows, mar­keted as the group’s first ex­clu­sive brand, has about 200 prod­ucts span­ning cat­e­gories from fresh pro­duce to snacks. It is avail­able at all Dairy Farm stores, in­clud­ing Cold Stor­age, Mar­ket Place and 7-Eleven.</p>
    <p>Dairy Farm’s chief ex­ec­u­tive of­fi­cer for its South-east Asia food busi­ness Chris Bush said yes­ter­day that Gi­ant’s own la­bel re­mains the cheap­est op­tion, while Mead­ows is po­si­tioned as “slightly higher qual­ity, bench­marked to the lead­ing brands, but at 20 per cent cheaper”.</p>
    <p>A Dairy Farm spokesman said the pan­demic has led to an over­all dou­ble-digit in­crease in the sales of its gro­cery re­tail busi­ness.</p>
    <p>“De­mand for our Mead­ows range of prod­ucts has grown pro­por­tion­ately with this in­crease,” the spokesman said, adding that the brand’s nuts and potato chip range is a top seller.</p>
    <p>At FairPrice, sales of house brand prod­ucts in­creased by 25 per cent be­tween March last year – when it froze the prices of 100 pop­u­lar items – and June this year, com­pared to the same 15-month pe­riod prior.</p>
    <p>The su­per­mar­ket chain is con­tin­u­ing to add to its range of 2,000 house brand prod­ucts, and is also ex­pand­ing its ex­clu­sive of­fer­ings, said FairPrice Group’s chief ex­ec­u­tive for Own Brands and Food So­lu­tions Busi­ness Grace Chua.</p>
    <p>This in­cludes the re­cently-launched SmartChoic­e la­bel, which in­cludes house­hold clean­ing prod­ucts and adult di­a­pers. More prod­ucts will be in­tro­duced by early next year, Ms Chua added.</p>
    <p>Sales of on­line gro­cer RedMart’s house brand prod­ucts, sold un­der the RedMart Pri­vate La­bel brand, have risen steadily this year, with monthly sales now 60 per cent higher than in Jan­uary, said Lazada Sin­ga­pore’s head of gro­cery Richard Ruddy.</p>
    <p>Work­ing di­rectly with man­u­fac­tur­ers helped to cush­ion RedMart against global sup­ply shocks in the early stages of the coro­n­avirus out­break, he added, as the com­pany was able to en­sure a steady sup­ply for most of its Pri­vate La­bel prod­ucts.</p>
    <p>RedMart is also work­ing on ex­pand­ing its house brand range of 360 prod­uct­sto in­clude more cook­ing and bak­ing es­sen­tials.</p>
    <p>Dr Se­shan Ra­maswami, as­so­ci­ate pro­fes­sor of mar­ket­ing ed­u­ca­tion at Sin­ga­pore Man­age­ment Univer­sity, noted that house brands give su­per­mar­kets bet­ter profit mar­gins than other branded prod­ucts.</p>
    <p>Con­sumers ben­e­fit too, as house brands are gen­er­ally of rea­son­able qual­ity, he added. “When eco­nomic con­di­tions are tough, as they are now, many house­holds shift to house brands to save money.”</p>
    <p>This poses a long-term risk to lead­ing brands, as con­sumers may not switch back, he added.</p>
    <p>House­wife Linda Wee, 42, said she opts for house brands as the sav­ings can be sub­stan­tial. “I used to avoid them for food, but the qual­ity and pack­ag­ing seem to have got­ten bet­ter.”</p>
