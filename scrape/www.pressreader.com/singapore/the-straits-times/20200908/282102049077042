    <p>The call for Sin­ga­pore’s ed­u­ca­tion sys­tem to re­duce its overem­pha­sis on grades is timely (Evo­lu­tion of ed­u­ca­tion sys­tem key to en­sur­ing fair, just so­ci­ety, Sept 4).</p>
    <p>The no­tion that get­ting bet­ter grades in a na­tional ex­am­i­na­tion equates with re­ceiv­ing an ad­e­quate ed­u­ca­tion is a mis­taken one. Poli­cies that em­pha­sise aca­demic achieve­ments only re­in­force this mis­con­cep­tion. Bet­ter exam grades do not equate with a good ed­u­ca­tion and many em­ploy­ers will at­test to that.</p>
    <p>Aside from hav­ing a neg­a­tive im­pact on fa­mil­ial re­la­tion­ships and a child’s self-es­teem, the quest to ex­cel in exams has led to aca­demic-re­lated stress and the preva­lence of anx­i­ety, mood dis­or­ders and even sui­cide among</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore stu­dents.</p>
    <p>Home­schooled chil­dren who have suc­cess­fully ap­plied to be ex­empted from at­tend­ing na­tional schools are sub­jected to more strin­gent re­quire­ments than stu­dents at­tend­ing na­tional schools. For them, a pass for the Pri­mary School Leav­ing Ex­am­i­na­tion (PSLE) is pegged at the 33rd per­centile ag­gre­gate score of stu­dents who take the four sub­jects in na­tional schools that year (equiv­a­lent to get­ting into the Ex­press stream in sec­ondary school).</p>
    <p>Fail­ing to achieve the bench­mark by even a mere point means hav­ing to re­sit the PSLE a sec­ond or third time, un­til the child reaches 15 years old.</p>
    <p>This is also the case for chil­dren who have been di­ag­nosed with learn­ing dif­fi­cul­ties.</p>
    <p>This pol­icy has cre­ated much stress for home­schooled chil­dren who, like chil­dren in na­tional schools, may not all be aca­dem­i­cally in­clined.</p>
    <p>The long-term im­pact on the self-es­teem of 12-year-olds who have to re­sit the PSLE should not be ig­nored or un­der­es­ti­mated.</p>
    <p>Par­ents like my hus­band and my­self who choose to home­school our chil­dren do so for dif­fer­ent rea­sons.</p>
    <p>I urge the Min­istry of Ed­u­ca­tion, in its pos­i­tive move to­wards en­act­ing poli­cies to de-em­pha­sise grades, not to ne­glect in­clud­ing home­school­ers in its con­sid­er­a­tion.</p>
