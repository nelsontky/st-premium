    <p>The tran­si­tion to US Pres­i­dent-elect Joe Bi­den’s ad­min­is­tra­tion re­mained in po­lit­i­cal limbo yes­ter­day, after Mr Don­ald Trump in­sisted the for­mer vicepres­i­dent had won the White House only in the eyes of the me­dia, and vowed to keep fight­ing what he called a “rigged” elec­tion.</p>
    <p>Mr Bi­den has spent his days since his vic­tory hud­dled with ad­vis­ers as he weighs his ap­point­ments to the Cab­i­net, fields con­grat­u­la­tory calls from world lead­ers and maps out poli­cies to pur­sue after be­ing sworn in on Jan 20.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, Mr Trump has con­tin­ued to press un­sub­stan­ti­ated al­le­ga­tions of fraud, stalling the process of pre­par­ing for a new pres­i­den­tial ad­min­is­tra­tion.</p>
    <p>In tweets yes­ter­day, Mr Trump wrote that Mr Bi­den “won be­cause the Elec­tion was Rigged”.</p>
    <p>“NO VOTE WATCH­ERS OR OB­SERVERS al­lowed, vote tab­u­lated by a Rad­i­cal Left pri­vately owned com­pany, Do­min­ion, with a bad rep­u­ta­tion & bum equip­ment that couldn’t even qual­ify for Texas (which I won by a lot!), the Fake & Silent Me­dia, & more!”</p>
    <p>In an­other tweet shortly after me­dia re­ported that his posts ap­peared to show he had con­ceded the out­come of the Nov 3 elec­tion, Mr Trump wrote: “He only won in the eyes of the FAKE NEWS ME­DIA. I con­cede NOTH­ING!”</p>
    <p>The Repub­li­can pres­i­dent’s cam­paign has filed law­suits seek­ing to over­turn the re­sults in mul­ti­ple states, though with­out suc­cess. Elec­tion of­fi­cials of both par­ties have said there is no ev­i­dence of ma­jor ir­reg­u­lar­i­ties.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, the “Mil­lion Maga March”, re­fer­ring to Mr Trump’s cam­paign slo­gan of “Make Amer­ica Great Again”, drew a crowd of flag-wav­ing sup­port­ers to down­town Wash­ing­ton last Satur­day.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump’s mo­tor­cade passed through the crowd on its way to his golf course in Vir­ginia, pro­duc­ing cheers from demon­stra­tors as he waved from the car.</p>
    <p>The march was largely peace­ful, though nu­mer­ous scuf­fles broke out be­tween Trump sup­port­ers and counter-pro­test­ers. One per­son was stabbed and taken to a trauma cen­tre.</p>
    <p>Dozens of Proud Boys, a far-right group, marched in the streets, some wear­ing hel­mets and bal­lis­tic vests, while mem­bers of the loose far-left move­ment known as an­tifa staged their own coun­ter­demon­stra­tions.</p>
    <p>The city’s po­lice force ar­rested at least 10 peo­ple, in­clud­ing sev­eral who were charged with as­sault.</p>
    <p>Mr Bi­den has won 306 votes in the state-by-state elec­toral col­lege sys­tem that de­ter­mines the pres­i­den­tial win­ner, ac­cord­ing to Edi­son Re­search, far more than the 270 needed to se­cure a ma­jor­ity.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump earned the same num­ber of elec­toral votes in 2016 over Mrs Hil­lary Clin­ton, a vic­tory he has called a “land­slide” de­spite the fact that she won the na­tional pop­u­lar vote.</p>
    <p>Mr Bi­den has also won the pop­u­lar vote: With a few states still count­ing bal­lots, he l eads Mr Trump by more than 5.5 mil­lion votes, or 3.6 per cent.</p>
    <p>With his chances of re­vers­ing the out­come vir­tu­ally ex­tin­guished, Mr Trump has dis­cussed with ad­vis­ers po­ten­tial me­dia ven­tures that would keep him in the spot­light ahead of a pos­si­ble 2024 White House bid, aides said.</p>
    <p>But his pub­lic claims of a “rigged” elec­tion have pre­vented Mr Bi­den and his team from gain­ing ac­cess to gov­ern­ment of­fice space and the fund­ing nor­mally af­forded to an in­com­ing ad­min­is­tra­tion to en­sure a smooth tran­si­tion.</p>
    <p>The fed­eral agency in charge of pro­vid­ing those re­sources has yet to recog­nise Mr Bi­den’s win.</p>
    <p>States are in the process of cer­ti­fy­ing their elec­tion re­sults. The elec­toral col­lege meets to vote for the new pres­i­dent on Dec 14.</p>
    <p>Mr Bi­den’s pick for White House chief of staff, Mr Ron Klain, has said that a rapid tran­si­tion is nec­es­sary to en­sure the gov­ern­ment is pre­pared to roll out a po­ten­tial Covid-19 vac­cine early next year.</p>
    <p>The rag­ing pandemic will likely be Mr Bi­den’s top pri­or­ity.</p>
    <p>The United States set a new daily record of new cases last Friday for the fourth straight day.</p>
