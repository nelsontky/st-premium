    <p>COPENHAGEN • Ship­ping group Maersk will cut jobs as part of a ma­jor re­or­gan­i­sa­tion, an in­ter­nal e-mail sent to its em­ploy­ees shows.</p>
    <p>The com­pany, which han­dles about one i n five con­tain­ers shipped world­wide, has been un­der pres­sure from in­vestors to speed up its trans­for­ma­tion from an un­wieldy con­glom­er­ate.</p>
    <p>Maersk sold its oil and gas as­sets in 2017 to French oil gi­ant To­tal as part of ef­forts to be­come a more stream­lined com­pany fo­cused on its con­tainer and in-land lo­gis­tics busi­ness for large cus­tomers such as Wal­mart and Nike.</p>
    <p>The in­te­gra­tion of its Damco freight for­ward­ing busi­ness and Africa-fo­cused car­rier Saf­ma­rine will take place by the end of this year, with its Ham­burg Sud op­er­a­tion also af­fected by the shake-up, the e-mail said.</p>
    <p>“Sim­pli­fy­ing the or­gan­i­sa­tion will re­gret­tably im­pact jobs due to du­pli­cate roles and roles that will no longer be needed,” chief com­mer­cial of­fi­cer Vin­cent Clerc said in the e-mail.</p>
    <p>A Maersk spokesman said that be­tween 26,000 and 27,000 em­ploy­ees out of Maersk’s to­tal head­count of 80,000 will be af­fected by the re­struc­tur­ing. The firm did not say how many would be laid off and the in­ter­nal e-mail also gave no de­tails on the num­ber of job cuts.</p>
    <p>In its state­ment, Maersk said that “a more sim­pli­fied and cus­tomer-cen­tric” Ocean and Lo­gis­tics or­gan­i­sa­tion is be­ing in­tro­duced as part of its strate­gic changes.</p>
    <p>A com­pany spokesman told The Straits Times that the firm aims to fi­nalise the re­or­gan­i­sa­tion process for most of its lo­ca­tions by Oct 1, and it is com­mit­ted to work­ing with em­ployee rep­re­sen­ta­tive bod­ies through the process.</p>
    <p>Maersk is not in a po­si­tion to dis­close spe­cific num­bers on af­fected em­ploy­ees, and the firm will en­sure that those whose jobs are af­fected will be in­formed first, she added.</p>
    <p>The com­pany has been es­tab­lished in Sin­ga­pore since 1975 and its main of­fice is lo­cated in Can­ton­ment Road.</p>
    <p>Ham­burg Sud, which Maersk bought in 2016, will re­main a sep­a­rate brand but its back of­fice will be rolled into that of Maersk, the com­pany said. The Saf­ma­rine and Damco brands will no longer be mar­keted by the end of this year.</p>
    <p>The Ham­burg Sud unit em­ploys 4,500 peo­ple while Damco and Saf­ma­rine have 2,300 and 1,100 staff re­spec­tively, ac­cord­ing to Maersk.</p>
