    <p>More than four months of pain, fear and un­cer­tainty will end to­day when the Na­tional Bas­ket­ball As­so­ci­a­tion sea­son restarts, with the block­buster Los An­ge­les derby and the Jazz-Pel­i­cans clash to take place un­der tightly con­trolled con­di­tions in Orlando, Florida, amid the still-rag­ing coron­avirus cri­sis.</p>
    <p>ORLANDO • LeBron James of the Los An­ge­les Lak­ers has likened the “bub­ble” to a youth bas­ket­ball tour­na­ment for grown men who hap­pen to be some of the most recog­nis­able sports stars on the planet.</p>
    <p>C.J. McCol­lum of the Port­land Trail Blaz­ers com­bats the pangs he feels for his fi­ancee and his dog back home with “my es­sen­tial oils and my de­hu­mid­i­fier and my books” and the oc­ca­sional in­dul­gence in wine he packed.</p>
    <p>Gone are the os­ten­ta­tious arena en­trances dressed in the finest fash­ions and the whirl of big-city night life. Four months af­ter Covid-19 sent bas­ket­ball into an un­prece­dented shut­down, the Na­tional Bas­ket­ball As­so­ci­a­tion (NBA) takes a leap into the un­known to­day as the league bids to res­ur­rect its sea­son at Dis­ney World in Orlando, Florida.</p>
    <p>The Utah Jazz l aunch the re­booted cam­paign against the New Or­leans Pel­i­cans be­fore James and Kawhi Leonard go head-to-head in a heavy­weight Los An­ge­les derby be­tween the Lak­ers and the Clip­pers.</p>
    <p>The two games mark the start of a painstak­ingly crafted plan to stage the re­main­der of the bas­ket­ball sea­son safely in the midst of an on­go­ing pan­demic which has al­ready claimed more than 150,000 lives in the United States.</p>
    <p>To mit­i­gate the risks, the NBA is bas­ing 22 teams within a tightly con­trolled bub­ble in­side Dis­ney World’s sprawl­ing cam­pus in Orlando. Teams will play games at three venues in the ESPN Wide World of Sports com­plex in­side the park, with no fans in at­ten­dance and only a smat­ter­ing of jour­nal­ists at each game.</p>
    <p>About 350 play­ers will be housed at three ho­tels lo­cated through­out Dis­ney World, with ac­cess to each location se­verely re­stricted and vis­its from out­siders strictly for­bid­den un­til the play-offs start.</p>
    <p>Play­ers ar­riv­ing in Orlando were re­quired to spend 48 hours iso­lated in their ho­tel rooms un­til they had re­turned two neg­a­tive tests for Covid-19.</p>
    <p>Test­ing will con­tinue in­side the bub­ble but it is not known how fre­quently this will take place.</p>
    <p>This “bub­ble” ex­per­i­ment might even be nec­es­sary for the 2020-21 sea­son to be held, Na­tional Bas­ket­ball Play­ers As­so­ci­a­tion ex­ec­u­tive di­rec­tor Michele Roberts said on Tues­day.</p>
    <p>“I’m not in the (Pres­i­dent Don­ald) Trump camp in be­liev­ing it’s all go­ing to go away in two weeks, but I’m pray­ing, pray­ing that there will be a dif­fer­ent set of cir­cum­stances that will al­low us to play in a dif­fer­ent way,” he told ESPN.</p>
    <p>While multi-mil­lion­aire stars such as the Lak­ers’ James have joked that en­ter­ing the bub­ble felt like start­ing a jail term, so far the launch of the project has gone smoothly.</p>
    <p>Prac­tice games have passed off with­out a hitch, and the most re­cent round of test­ing found zero pos­i­tive cases out of 346 play­ers tested.</p>
    <p>There have been some early glitches, how­ever, as play­ers ad­just to the rel­a­tively spar­tan sur­round­ings of the bub­ble.</p>
    <p>Clip­pers guard Lou Wil­liams was forced to quar­an­tine for 10 days af­ter be­ing pho­tographed at an At­lanta strip club dur­ing a trip out of the bub­ble to at­tend a fam­ily funeral. The Sacra­mento Kings’ Richaun Holmes also landed back in quar­an­tine af­ter he left the bub­ble to pick up an or­der of chicken wings.</p>
    <p>The league is spend­ing at least US$180 mil­lion (S$248 mil­lion) with ESPN’s par­ent com­pany, Dis­ney, on its test­ing op­er­a­tion to avoid a po­ten­tial loss of US$1 bil­lion in tele­vi­sion rev­enue.</p>
    <p>In­side the bub­ble’s three are­nas, the legacy of the tu­mul­tuous protests which erupted i n the weeks af­ter the death of Ge­orge Floyd in May will be on full view.</p>
    <p>Giant “Black Lives Mat­ter” slo­gans have been writ­ten on each court, while play­ers will be al­lowed to wear jer­seys adorned with so­cial jus­tice mes­sages rang­ing from “I Can’t Breathe” to “Jus­tice Now” and “Ed­u­ca­tion Re­form”.</p>
    <p>On the courts, all eyes will be on James and his Lak­ers team­mates as they at­tempt to re­turn to the pin­na­cle of the NBA when the sea­son wraps up in Oc­to­ber.</p>
    <p>The big­gest threat to J ames’ hopes of win­ning a fourth NBA cham­pi­onship is ex­pected to come from the Eastern Con­fer­ence, where Gian­nis An­te­tok­oun­mpo is aim­ing to guide the Mil­wau­kee Bucks to their first ti­tle in nearly half a cen­tury. The Bucks had run away with the Eastern Con­fer­ence be­fore the hia­tus, open­ing up a 6.5-game lead over the de­fend­ing cham­pi­ons Toronto Rap­tors.</p>
    <p>An­te­tok­oun­mpo, who grew up in poverty in Greece as the son of Nige­rian im­mi­grants, smiles at the sug­ges­tion that NBA play­ers are fac­ing hard­ship in their con­fined en­vi­ron­ment in Orlando.</p>
    <p>“It doesn’t mat­ter where you are in life, there’s always some­thing to com­plain, there’s always a prob­lem and an is­sue,” he said. “My apart­ment i n Greece, when I was younger, with my four broth­ers, was way smaller than the suite that I have in the ho­tel, so I’m just try­ing to en­joy the mo­ment.”</p>
    <p>An­te­tok­oun­mpo’s view­point was echoed by Ok­la­homa City Thun­der’s Steven Adams.</p>
    <p>“Let’s be clear, mate,” the New Zealan­der said. “This is not Syria. We’re liv­ing in a bloody re­sort.”</p>
    <p>NOT TOO SHABBY</p>
    <p>Let’s be clear, mate. This is not Syria. We’re liv­ing in a bloody re­sort.</p>
    <p>’’</p>
