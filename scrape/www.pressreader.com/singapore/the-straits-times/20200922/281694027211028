    <p>About a quar­ter of pa­tients aged 13 and above di­ag­nosed with an acute re­s­pi­ra­tory in­fec­tion (ARI) from July 1 to Aug 16 de­clined a Covid-19 swab test, with some cit­ing fear of dis­com­fort.</p>
    <p>Since July 1, it has been a pol­icy for all pa­tients aged 13 and above who are di­ag­nosed with ARI to be of­fered the swab test for the virus when they first see a doc­tor, as part of ef­forts to sup­port more ac­tive case-find­ing in the community.</p>
    <p>Re­spond­ing to queries from The Straits Times, the Min­istry of Health (MOH) said that pa­tients who de­cline the swab test are given a five-day med­i­cal cer­tifi­cate, dur­ing which they are legally re­quired to stay at home.</p>
    <p>If a doc­tor as­sesses that a pa­tient meets the sus­pect case def­i­ni­tion of Covid-19, or has pro­longed ARI at the end of the five-day pe­riod, the pa­tient is legally re­quired to go for a swab test.</p>
    <p>MOH said it un­der­stands that some pa­tients have con­cerns about be­ing swabbed, such as fear­ing the dis­com­fort that might oc­cur dur­ing the process. “We will con­tinue to work with health­care providers to ex­plain to pa­tients that the swab is quick and causes only slight dis­com­fort,” said the min­istry.</p>
    <p>MOH had pre­vi­ously said it was as­sess­ing the use of saliva test­ing to de­tect Covid-19 here. It added that most sam­ples for Covid-19 test­ing are col­lected through na­sopha­ryn­geal (back of the nose) or oropha­ryn­geal (back of the throat) swabs, which can be pooled, thus al­low­ing for high vol­umes of tests to be ef­fi­ciently pro­cessed daily.</p>
    <p>Pre­lim­i­nary find­ings have shown that saliva test­ing may be slightly more com­fort­able for some in­di­vid­u­als, though mech­a­nisms to scale up test­ing in lab­o­ra­to­ries, in­clud­ing pooled test­ing, are still be­ing de­vel­oped.</p>
    <p>MOH added that it also pro­vides SMS re­minders to pa­tients of up­com­ing swab ap­point­ments, and works with gen­eral prac­ti­tioner clin­ics to call pa­tients to resched­ule their swab ap­point­ments if pa­tients miss them.</p>
    <p>The min­istry said it urges every­one to be so­cially re­spon­si­ble, and that those who are un­well – par­tic­u­larly those with mild symp­toms of fever, cough, sore throat, runny nose and loss of smell – should see a doc­tor promptly, and go for a swab test when their doc­tor tells them to do so.</p>
    <p>MOH added: “It is im­por­tant to test for Covid-19 early for early dis­ease man­age­ment, be­cause in some pa­tients the dis­ease be­comes more se­vere in the sec­ond week.</p>
    <p>“Early di­ag­no­sis also al­lows for early de­tec­tion and con­tain­ment to pre­vent fur­ther spread, to help pro­tect loved ones and vul­ner­a­ble mem­bers of the community from get­ting in­fected.”</p>
