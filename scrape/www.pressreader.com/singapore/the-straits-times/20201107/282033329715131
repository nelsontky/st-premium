    <p>MINNEAPOLI­S (Min­nesota) • In an im­por­tant win for the pros­e­cu­tion, a judge in Minneapoli­s on Thurs­day ruled that the four of­fi­cers charged in the killing of Mr Ge­orge Floyd, a Black man who took some of his last breaths un­der the knee of a white of­fi­cer on a Minneapoli­s street cor­ner in May, will stand trial to­gether.</p>
    <p>The j udge also ruled that the news me­dia can broad­cast the trial, sched­uled for next spring – an un­usual move in Minneapoli­s, where courts are gen­er­ally closed to cam­eras. The judge cited the coro­n­avirus pan­demic, which lim­its the num­ber of peo­ple who can be in the court­room at any time, and the im­mense na­tional and in­ter­na­tional in­ter­est in the case.</p>
    <p>“Protests de­mand­ing jus­tice for Ge­orge Floyd con­tinue,” Judge Peter Cahill of Hen­nepin County wrote in his rul­ing.</p>
    <p>“It is ex­pected that, even with some over­flow court­rooms, the de­mand by fam­ily mem­bers, the public, and the press to at­tend the joint trial will out­strip the court’s abil­ity to pro­vide mean­ing­ful ac­cess.”</p>
    <p>Judge Cahill said the trial will re­main in the Twin Cities, but left open the pos­si­bil­ity of mov­ing it later if the court is un­able to seat a jury un­tainted by the pub­lic­ity the case has gen­er­ated.</p>
    <p>The de­fen­dants, in­clud­ing of­fi­cer Derek Chau­vin who pinned Mr Floyd to the ground for more than nine min­utes, asked the court for a change of venue, ar­gu­ing that they would not be able to re­ceive a fair trial in Minneapoli­s be­cause of pre­trial pub­lic­ity and the widescale protests against racial in­jus­tice Mr Floyd’s death sparked there, around the coun­try and the world.</p>
    <p>Judge Cahill also or­dered that the ju­rors re­main anony­mous and said they would be par­tially se­questered dur­ing the trial and or­dered to meet at a se­cure lo­ca­tion be­fore be­ing es­corted to court.</p>
    <p>At­tor­ney-Gen­eral Keith El­li­son of Min­nesota, whose of­fice is over­see­ing the pros­e­cu­tion, said in a state­ment that he was sat­is­fied with the court’s de­ci­sion.</p>
    <p>Chau­vin, who had been a 19-year-vet­eran on the force, is charged with sec­ond-de­gree mur­der and sec­ond-de­gree man­slaugh­ter and faces 40 years in prison if con­victed.</p>
    <p>The other of­fi­cers, in­clud­ing two rook­ies who had helped Chau­vin pin Mr Floyd to the pave­ment, are charged with aid­ing and abet­ting sec­ond-de­gree mur­der. All four for­mer of­fi­cers, who were fired af­ter the in­ci­dent, have been re­leased on bail.</p>
    <p>All four of the for­mer of­fi­cers had asked for sep­a­rate tri­als and sug­gested in court fil­ings that they each place blame for Mr Floyd’s death onto one an­other. The pros­e­cu­tion, all along, has asked for one trial, ar­gu­ing that mul­ti­ple tri­als would trau­ma­tise Mr Floyd’s fam­ily, eye­wit­nesses and the larger com­mu­nity, which faced weeks of un­rest in the streets af­ter the death.</p>
    <p>In his rul­ing or­der­ing one trial, Judge Cahill noted that the de­fence for all four de­fen­dants cen­tres on sim­i­lar ar­gu­ments: that the use of force to sub­due Mr Floyd was jus­ti­fied and that his death was caused by drugs found in his sys­tem and un­der­ly­ing health con­di­tions.</p>
    <p>The med­i­cal ex­am­iner has ruled Mr Floyd’s death a homi­cide be­cause of “car­diopul­monary ar­rest” from Chau­vin’s knee, with other causes con­sid­ered con­tribut­ing fac­tors.</p>
