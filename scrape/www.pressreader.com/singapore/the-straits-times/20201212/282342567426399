    <p>Sin­ga­pore’s Sea, the tech­nol­ogy start-up that has be­come South­east Asia’s most valu­able com­pany, in­creased the size and set the fi­nal price of a se­condary stock of­fer­ing to raise at least US$2.57 bil­lion (S$3.4 bil­lion).</p>
    <p>Sea priced the sale of 13.2 mil­lion Amer­i­can de­posi­tary shares at</p>
    <p>US$195 each, in­creas­ing the size from 11 mil­lion be­cause of strong de­mand, ac­cord­ing to a state­ment.</p>
    <p>The un­der­writ­ers, led by Gold­man Sachs Group and JP­Mor­gan Chase & Co, have the op­tion for an­other 1.98 mil­lion shares, which would yield US$386 mil­lion at the same price.</p>
    <p>Sea, a games com­pany that has ex­panded into e-com­merce and dig­i­tal pay­ments, has surged to a mar­ket val­u­a­tion of al­most US$100 bil­lion, with its shares ris­ing 395 per cent this year alone.</p>
    <p>It in­tends to spend the pro­ceeds from the new of­fer­ing on busi­ness ex­pan­sion, “in­clud­ing po­ten­tial strate­gic in­vest­ments and ac­qui­si­tions”, the firm said in its state­ment.</p>
    <p>The com­pany just won a li­cence to open a dig­i­tal bank in Sin­ga­pore, a cov­eted award that will al­low ex­pan­sion into fi­nan­cial ser­vices.</p>
    <p>Un­der cri­te­ria set by the Mone­tary Author­ity of Sin­ga­pore, dig­i­tal full banks are re­quired to have to­tal cap­i­tal of at least $1.5 bil­lion, with $15 mil­lion at en­try and pro­gres­sively in­creas­ing the cap­i­tal.</p>
    <p>The new cap­i­tal could be used for its dig­i­tal bank or to ac­cel­er­ate e-com­merce and gam­ing in­vest­ments, Bloomberg In­tel­li­gence an­a­lysts Matthew Kan­ter­man and Joyce Ho wrote in a note.</p>
    <p>Sea’s first self-made mo­bile game, a bat­tle royale called Free Fire, has at­tracted tens of mil­lions of play­ers and its game­play is now one of YouTube’s most-watched at­trac­tions.</p>
    <p>The com­pany’s Shopee plat­form has also surged i n sync with greater de­mand for home shop­ping and food de­liv­ery, hav­ing taken the man­tle of South-east Asia’s lead­ing e-com­merce provider at the end of last year, ac­cord­ing to re­search firm iPrice.</p>
