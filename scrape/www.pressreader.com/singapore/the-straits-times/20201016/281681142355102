    <p>The size and sig­nif­i­cance of the un­prece­dented $52 bil­lion that Sin­ga­pore has drawn from its re­serves should not be un­der­es­ti­mated, Deputy Prime Min­is­ter Heng Swee Keat said in Par­lia­ment yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>This has en­abled Sin­ga­pore to mount a quick and strong re­sponse to the fall­out from the Covid-19 pan­demic, he added.</p>
    <p>He was re­spond­ing to points made by Non-Con­stituency MP Leong Mun Wai, when wrapping up a two-day de­bate on the Gov­ern­ment’s strat­egy to emerge stronger after Covid-19.</p>
    <p>Mr Leong, who is from the Progress Sin­ga­pore Party, had said that the lat­est gov­ern­ment fi­nan­cial state­ments as at end-March re­port that Sin­ga­pore owns a to­tal of $1.35 tril­lion in fi­nan­cial as­sets.</p>
    <p>Tak­ing into ac­count the Net In­vest­ment Re­turns Con­tri­bu­tion (NIRC), he said the de­crease in Sin­ga­pore’s fi­nan­cial as­sets is $14.8 bil­lion. The NIRC refers to the re­turns on in­vest­ments of Sin­ga­pore’s re­serves, and is the top con­trib­u­tor to gov­ern­ment cof­fers.</p>
    <p>This, he said, means that Sin­ga­pore has used up only 1.1 per cent of its to­tal fi­nan­cial as­sets to fight Covid-19 this year, and that there is no need for tax and fee hikes to take place so soon.</p>
    <p>To this, Mr Heng said the Net In­vest­ment Re­turns (NIR) frame­work is based on ex­pected long-term re­turns, not ac­tual re­turns. “It is in­cor­rect to es­ti­mate the ac­tual re­turn by mul­ti­ply­ing the NIRC by two”.</p>
    <p>The DPM also said it is wrong to sub­tract the re­turns from the $52 bil­lion to de­rive a net spend­ing fig­ure in con­sid­er­ing the amount Sin­ga­pore is spend­ing from its re­serves.</p>
    <p>In ad­di­tion to the draw, Sin­ga­pore con­tin­ues to spend the NIRC, which also comes from re­serves.</p>
    <p>“Fur­ther­more, the amount drawn from re­serves would have gen­er­ated re­turns in per­pe­tu­ity with­out a draw,” noted Mr Heng, who is also Fi­nance Min­is­ter and Co­or­di­nat­ing Min­is­ter for Eco­nomic Poli­cies.</p>
    <p>While the draw on re­serves would lead to some im­pact on the NIRC, the de­sign of the NIR frame­work al­lows for a stable and sus­tain­able source of in­come for Sin­ga­pore’s Bud­get, smoothed out over market cy­cles, he said in re­ply­ing to Mr</p>
    <p>Louis Chua (Sengkang GRC).</p>
    <p>“This means that when the pro­jected re­turns and value of the net as­set base goes down, we do not see an im­me­di­ate pro­por­tion­ate de­crease in NIRC. In the same way, in pe­ri­ods of sharp spikes in the market and as­set val­ues go up, we do not see an im­me­di­ate in­crease and over­spend,” said Mr Heng.</p>
    <p>In his re­sponse to Mr Ger­ald Giam (Alju­nied GRC), who asked if the $52 bil­lion drawn from the re­serves would be re­turned in full or in part, and said that restor­ing the amount in a short time could sub­ject Sin­ga­pore­ans to un­nec­es­sar­ily high lev­els of aus­ter­ity, the DPM ex­plained that there is no obli­ga­tion un­der the Con­sti­tu­tion for the Gov­ern­ment to put back the amount drawn from past re­serves.</p>
    <p>“Rather, it is about hav­ing the moral obli­ga­tion and sense of duty to cur­rent and fu­ture gen­er­a­tions,” he said.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore re­mains com­mit­ted to run­ning a broadly bal­anced Bud­get over each term of gov­ern­ment, and the Gov­ern­ment will as­sess the vi­a­bil­ity of re­turn­ing the amount drawn, de­pend­ing on Sin­ga­pore’s fis­cal po­si­tion, he said.</p>
    <p>He added that it is not pos­si­ble for him to be de­fin­i­tive on how long it will take Sin­ga­pore to build up suf­fi­cient sur­pluses to make up the $52 bil­lion. “But I can say that it will not be two years, and I cer­tainly hope it will not take us 50 years.”</p>
    <p>The Covid-19 pan­demic has demon­strated how the re­serves have al­lowed Sin­ga­pore to re­main nim­ble in times of un­cer­tainty, said Mr Heng.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore has to be more cir­cum­spect when it comes to us­ing more re­serves in the face of greater un­cer­tain­ties ahead, he added.</p>
    <p>The global econ­omy and fi­nan­cial sys­tem will be more volatile, he said, with the build-up of debt glob­ally in­tro­duc­ing in­sta­bil­ity in the fi­nan­cial sys­tem, which can lead to or worsen crises.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore is also see­ing in­creas­ing risk of geopo­lit­i­cal con­flicts and de­glob­al­i­sa­tion.</p>
    <p>In a re­ply to Mr Liang Eng Hwa (Bukit Pan­jang), Mr Heng said that should it be nec­es­sary for the Gov­ern­ment to fur­ther draw on the re­serves amid the cri­sis, he is pre­pared to pro­pose this to the Pres­i­dent.</p>
    <p>In the medium to longer term, Sin­ga­pore’s ap­proach is to adapt and find new ways to gen­er­ate growth, he added.</p>
    <p>“We must work hard to get our­selves back in a po­si­tion where our econ­omy is grow­ing and we can build up re­serves for the fu­ture again. This is the sus­tain­able and pru­dent way for­ward.”</p>
