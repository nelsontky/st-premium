    <p>As the pan­demic rages on, Sin­ga­pore will work to en­sure it has the re­sources to treat coronaviru­s pa­tients and deal with sud­den surges in case num­bers.</p>
    <p>Health Min­is­ter Gan Kim Yong yes­ter­day said his min­istry will con­tinue to main­tain “ad­e­quate quar­an­tine and com­mu­nity isolation ca­pac­ity” in case of a surge.</p>
    <p>It will also tap data and tech­nol­ogy to im­prove the coun­try’s abil­ity to re­spond quickly to evolv­ing sit­u­a­tions and con­tain out­breaks, he added in the Min­istry of Health’s (MOH) ad­den­dum to the Pres­i­dent’s Ad­dress.</p>
    <p>“The Covid-19 pan­demic has pre­sented an un­prece­dented chal­lenge for our health­care sys­tem,” said Mr Gan.</p>
    <p>“We are com­mit­ted to con­tin­u­ing our fight against Covid-19, while also con­tin­u­ing to trans­form and strengthen our health sys­tems in a sus­tain­able way for the long term.”</p>
    <p>Lay­ing out Sin­ga­pore’s ap­proach to the fight against Covid-19, Mr Gan warned that fur­ther waves of the dis­ease are pos­si­ble as long as a vac­cine re­mains out of reach.</p>
    <p>To that end, MOH will make sure Sin­ga­pore has the re­sources to care for all Covid-19 pa­tients and sup­port all health­care in­sti­tu­tions in­volved in the fight.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore will also work with its in­ter­na­tional part­ners to share in­for­ma­tion on cases and re­mains “ac­tively in­volved” in de­vel­op­ing vac­cines and treat­ments for the virus, Mr Gan said.</p>
    <p>Dig­i­tal­i­sa­tion projects to do with tele­health and re­mote work­ing for staff will be ac­cel­er­ated, with MOH work­ing on plans to im­prove ca­reer devel­op­ment and wel­fare in the sec­tor. It will also press on with longterm plans to ex­pand health­care ca­pac­ity, keep med­i­cal costs af­ford­able and help Sin­ga­pore­ans stay healthy.</p>
    <p>The min­istry has plans to make pre­ven­tive health­care more ac­ces­si­ble and af­ford­able, and ex­tend more help to vulnerable groups such as se­niors and young peo­ple at risk of men­tal health con­di­tions.</p>
    <p>The na­tion­wide war against di­a­betes will also con­tinue.</p>
    <p>Elder­care ser­vices will grad­u­ally ex­pand their scope to in­clude ac­tive age­ing pro­grammes or be­friend­ing schemes for the lonely, while new health­care fa­cil­i­ties are also in the pipe­line.</p>
    <p>“While Covid-19 has pushed back the com­ple­tion time­lines for some of the up­com­ing new fa­cil­i­ties, we will con­tinue to ex­pand our health­care ca­pac­ity, such as by build­ing a new hos­pi­tal in the east and new poly­clin­ics across Sin­ga­pore by 2030,” Mr Gan said.</p>
    <p>Work is also on­go­ing on schemes to keep health­care af­ford­able.</p>
    <p>For in­stance, ben­e­fits and pre­mi­ums un­der the na­tional health in­sur­ance scheme, MediShield Life, are un­der review to en­sure Sin­ga­pore­ans are ad­e­quately pro­tected against large med­i­cal bills.</p>
    <p>Health­care sub­sidy frame­works are also be­ing re­viewed, Mr Gan said.</p>
    <p>“Al­though it has pre­sented us with many chal­lenges, Covid-19 has also strength­ened our re­solve to trans­form health­care,” he added.</p>
    <p>Apart from its dig­i­tal­i­sa­tion projects, MOH will also strengthen re­search and devel­op­ment and im­prove its data in­fra­struc­ture.</p>
    <p>“We will man­age the roll-out of these ini­tia­tives ex­pe­di­tiously and se­curely, whilst strength­en­ing cy­ber se­cu­rity across MOH, its statu­tory boards and the health­care sec­tor,” Mr Gan said.</p>
    <p>The min­istry will also ramp up re­cruit­ment in the sec­tor, even as it looks at how to im­prove ca­reer devel­op­ment and wel­fare of health­care work­ers.</p>
