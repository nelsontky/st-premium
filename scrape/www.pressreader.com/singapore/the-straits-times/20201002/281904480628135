    <p>NEW YORK “I’m just sad with the way last night turned out.”</p>
    <p>Mr Chris Wal­lace, the Fox News Sun­day an­chor and mod­er­a­tor of Tues­day’s melee of a de­bate be­tween United States Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump and his demo­cratic ri­val Joe Biden on Wed­nes­day, re­flected on “a ter­ri­ble missed op­por­tu­nity”.</p>
    <p>“I never dreamt that it would go off the tracks the way it did,” Mr Wal­lace said in his first in­ter­view since the chaotic and of­ten in­co­her­ent spec­ta­cle, in which a pugilis­tic Mr Trump re­lent­lessly in­ter­rupted op­po­nent and mod­er­a­tor alike.</p>
    <p>The an­chor con­ceded that he had been slow to recog­nise that the Pres­i­dent was not go­ing to cease flout­ing the de­bate’s rules.</p>
    <p>“I guess I didn’t re­alise... that this was go­ing to be the Pres­i­dent’s strat­egy, not just for the be­gin­ning of the de­bate but the en­tire de­bate,” he said. “I’m a pro. I’ve never been through any­thing like this.”</p>
    <p>Mr Trump’s bul­ly­ing be­hav­iour had no ob­vi­ous prece­dent in pres­i­den­tial de­bates, even the one that Mr Wal­lace pre­vi­ously mod­er­ated, to ac­claim, in 2016.</p>
    <p>In the in­ter­view, the an­chor said that when Mr Trump ini­tially en­gaged di­rectly with Mr Biden, “I thought this was great – this is a de­bate”.</p>
    <p>But as the Pres­i­dent gave no sign of back­ing off, Mr Wal­lace said, he grew more alarmed.</p>
    <p>Asked what he was feel­ing when he called the de­bate to a tem­po­rary halt – in­struct­ing the can­di­dates that “the coun­try would be bet­ter served if we al­lowed both peo­ple to speak with fewer in­ter­rup­tions” – Mr Wal­lace said: “Des­per­a­tion.”</p>
    <p>Asked if Mr Trump had de­railed the de­bate, he replied, “Well, he cer­tainly didn’t help.”</p>
    <p>In the spot­light, Mr Wal­lace was keenly aware of the com­plex­ity of his task: en­sur­ing an even-handed de­bate, avoid­ing tak­ing sides, al­low­ing the can­di­dates to ex­press them­selves while keep­ing the dis­cus­sion sub­stan­tive.</p>
    <p>He said: “You’re re­luc­tant – as some­body who has said from the very be­gin­ning that I wanted to be as in­vis­i­ble as pos­si­ble, and to en­able them to talk – to rise to the point at which you be­gin to in­ter­ject more and more.”</p>
    <p>The Com­mis­sion on Pres­i­den­tial De­bates said on Wed­nes­day that it would ex­am­ine changes to the for­mat of this year’s re­main­ing en­coun­ters be­tween Mr Biden and Mr Trump.</p>
    <p>Mr Steve Scully of ca­ble news chan­nel C-Span is set to mod­er­ate the next de­bate, in a town hall for­mat. Ms Kris­ten Welker of NBC News is the mod­er­a­tor for the fi­nal de­bate.</p>
    <p>“I’ve been in­volved in a cer­tain amount of soul-search­ing,” Mr Wal­lace said.</p>
    <p>“I’m just dis­ap­pointed with the re­sults. For me, but much more im­por­tantly, I’m dis­ap­pointed for the coun­try, be­cause it could have been a much more use­ful evening than it turned out to be.”</p>
