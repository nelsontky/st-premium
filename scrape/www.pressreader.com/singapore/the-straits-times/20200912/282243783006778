    <p>When most of us think of bees, the im­age of yel­low-and-black striped hon­ey­bees comes to mind.</p>
    <p>We also think of painful stings, buzzing bee­hives and an­gry swarms.</p>
    <p>But, in re­al­ity, there is an en­tire trove of colour­ful and quirky bees which call Sin­ga­pore home.</p>
    <p>To date, more than 130 bee species have been found here, few of which live in hives.</p>
    <p>In fact, the ma­jor­ity of bees are soli­tary, and 40 per cent of them live un­der­ground, in tiny bur­rows dug into soil and sand. Oth­ers live in the holes of tree trunks and the hol­low ends of stems.</p>
    <p>Un­ex­pect­edly, leaf­cut­ter bees cut neat semi-cir­cles out of leaves and use those bits to build their nests.</p>
    <p>Soli­tary bees also live in man­made bee ho­tels, which look like bird­houses but have tiny holes drilled in the wood for the in­sects to nest and raise their young.</p>
    <p>Such bee ho­tels can be found at HortPark, a 10ha park and gar­den­ing re­source cen­tre in Alexan­dra.</p>
    <p>About 40 species of bees call HortPark home, and many of them can be spot­ted along the park’s Bee Trail.</p>
    <p>When The Straits Times vis­ited the trail with two bee ex­perts on Wed­nes­day, a male dis­junct resin bee was lurk­ing out­side one bee ho­tel, try­ing to draw out a fe­male. It was not his lucky day.</p>
    <p>Con­trary to pop­u­lar be­lief, bees are not only yel­low, brown and black.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore is home to blue bees as well, such as the hi­malayan cloakand-dag­ger bee, which wears a bril­liant blue coat on its ab­domen, tho­rax and legs, against black pat­terns.</p>
    <p>One was spot­ted flit­ting about a flow­er­ing shrub at HortPark col­lect­ing nec­tar.</p>
    <p>“It looks very fairy-like and you don’t ac­tu­ally be­lieve that a bee could be blue,” said Mr Zestin Soh, se­nior man­ager at Sin­ga­pore</p>
    <p>Botanic Gar­dens and one of the bee ex­perts who joined The Straits Times on the Bee Trail.</p>
    <p>The other ex­pert on the trail, As­sis­tant Pro­fes­sor John Ascher from the Na­tional Univer­sity of Sin­ga­pore’s bi­o­log­i­cal sciences de­part­ment, said there are about 12 blue bee species in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>Larger blue bees with blue hairs on their heads and tho­raxes are found only in South-east Asia.</p>
    <p>The cerulean car­pen­ter bee is one of them, and was also one of the first bee species dis­cov­ered here, in 1854.</p>
    <p>Bee re­search in Sin­ga­pore started about 160 years ago, but bees have been stud­ied more sys­tem­at­i­cally only since 2011.</p>
    <p>As a re­sult, 40 more species have been recorded.</p>
    <p>Mr Soh and Prof Ascher jointly wrote the first guide­book on bees in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>The ex­perts em­pha­sised that bees are not to be feared, as most of them, es­pe­cially the soli­tary ones, are docile, shy and no more dan­ger­ous than a but­ter­fly.</p>
    <p>Prof Ascher said: “Any bee that is busy for­ag­ing or vis­it­ing a flower is harm­less and never ag­gres­sive.”</p>
    <p>The most com­mon species here, the asian honey bee, will at­tack if its nest is dis­turbed.</p>
    <p>Said Mr Soh: “The best ap­proach is to not dis­turb a honey­bee’s nest and keep a dis­tance.”</p>
    <p>The largest bee in Penin­su­lar Malaysia, the jet-black broad­handed car­pen­ter, was seen at the end of the Bee Trail.</p>
    <p>It was a 3.8cm-long male that pa­trolled its ter­ri­tory, perched on tall flow­ers and swooped down to fight but­ter­flies. It buzzed over ap­proach­ing peo­ple, then re­turned to its perch.</p>
    <p>“He was just check­ing us out and doesn’t mean any harm,” said Mr Soh.</p>

        <p data-role="text">Above: The male jet-black broad-handed car&#xAD;pen&#xAD;ter bee is ter&#xAD;ri&#xAD;to&#xAD;rial, and the one seen here is perch&#xAD;ing on a tall flower to guard its area. It also swoops down to fight en&#xAD;e&#xAD;mies such as but&#xAD;ter&#xAD;flies that en&#xAD;ter its ter&#xAD;ri&#xAD;tory. This species of bee is the largest in Penin&#xAD;su&#xAD;lar Malaysia.</p>
