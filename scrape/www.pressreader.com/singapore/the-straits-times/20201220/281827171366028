    <p>Nearly six in 10 Sin­ga­pore­ans are will­ing to spend be­yond the $100 value of their Sin­ga­poRe dis­cov­ers vouch­ers on stay­ca­tions, at­trac­tions and tours, a sur­vey has found.</p>
    <p>The on­line poll, con­ducted by The Sun­day Times, ran for a week shortly af­ter the voucher scheme went live on Dec 1. The sur­vey at­tracted nearly 300 re­sponses.</p>
    <p>Mr Muham­mad Salleh Ab­dul Hamid, 29, a teach­ing as­sis­tant at a spe­cial needs school, was among those will­ing to spend more.</p>
    <p>He got mar­ried ear­lier this month and plans to go for a stay­ca­tion with his wife to make up for the lost hon­ey­moon.</p>
    <p>“Ini­tially, we wanted to have a short trip over­seas, but the cur­rent sit­u­a­tion doesn’t per­mit that. Thus, hav­ing a stay­ca­tion would suf­fice for now,” he said.</p>
    <p>Dr Wong King Yin, a mar­ket­ing lec­turer at Nanyang Tech­no­log­i­cal Univer­sity, told The Sun­day Times: “Due to the pan­demic, Sin­ga­pore­ans can’t go any­where this year. They may be will­ing to spend the money that has been re­served for over­seas travel in Sin­ga­pore.”</p>
    <p>The $320 mil­lion Sin­ga­poRe di scov­ers credit scheme is meant to boost Sin­ga­pore’s tourism sec­tor.</p>
    <p>All five au­tho­rised book­ing plat­forms said they have seen a healthy pro­por­tion of Sin­ga­pore­ans will­ing to top up when us­ing the vouch­ers.</p>
    <p>Book­ing plat­form Trav­eloka said it has seen more than half of Sin­ga­pore­ans pick­ing ho­tel and at­trac­tion op­tions that ex­ceeded $100.</p>
    <p>Glob­alTix said: “Sin­ga­pore­ans are big on value and great deals. Hence when they see value in the prod­uct of­fer­ings, they are ready to top up ac­cord­ingly.”</p>
    <p>Three in 10 sur­vey re­spon­dents said they are likely to use the vouch­ers on at­trac­tion tick­ets, while al­most two in 10 said they would go for a ho­tel stay­ca­tion bun­dled with at­trac­tion tick­ets.</p>
    <p>Top­ping the list of what they would use their vouch­ers for are ac­tiv­i­ties linked to na­ture, such as vis­it­ing the zoo, and re­lax­ing op­tions such as ho­tel stay­ca­tions.</p>
    <p>Oth­ers ex­pressed in­ter­est in things like bungee jump­ing and her­itage and cul­ture tours.</p>
    <p>Dr Wong said: “I think most Sin­ga­pore­ans feel very stressed this year. Many peo­ple want to take a break and re­lax.</p>
    <p>“Na­ture is the most pop­u­lar choice, per­haps be­cause it is the safest way to stay away from the crowd... and re­lax both phys­i­cally and men­tally.”</p>
    <p>A bug­bear with 32.1 per cent of re­spon­dents is that vouch­ers can­not be trans­ferred be­tween in­di­vid­u­als or com­bined with other peo­ple’s vouch­ers.</p>
    <p>The Sin­ga­pore Tourism Board (STB) said last month it de­cided against al­low­ing that so more busi­nesses af­fected by Covid-19 can ben­e­fit.</p>
    <p>Mr Kevin Wee, a se­nior lec­turer at Nanyang Polytech­nic’s hos­pi­tal­ity and tourism man­age­ment pro­gramme, said: “I be­lieve th­ese lit­tle in­con­ve­niences will not af­fect the Sin­gapoRedis­cov­ers voucher scheme. Ul­ti­mately, Sin­ga­pore­ans are given a $100 in­cen­tive to go on a hol­i­day. Who’s go­ing to say no to hav­ing a sub­sidised hol­i­day?”</p>
    <p>Other con­cerns raised in­clude prices be­ing hiked and sold-out ac­tiv­i­ties.</p>
    <p>STB has said it will pe­nalise mer­chants found to be prof­i­teer­ing.</p>
    <p>But Dr Wong said Sin­ga­pore­ans are savvy cus­tomers, adding: “Mer­chants who jacked up the prices of the pack­ages and at­trac­tions may leave a bad im­pres­sion.</p>
    <p>“Mer­chants who launch pack­ages which can of­fer great value to cus­tomers can take this chance to build up their clien­tele and loy­alty among cus­tomers.”</p>
