    <p>Un­der­stand­ing po­ten­tial and emerg­ing pat­terns in pop­u­la­tion lev­els is es­sen­tial for any­one tasked with plan­ning for a so­ci­ety’s chang­ing age struc­tures, the health­care re­sources that would in­volve, and their im­pact on the eco­nomic land­scape. When longevity in Singapore ex­ceeds that of Ja­pan, it is a cause for not only cel­e­bra­tion but also in­tro­spec­tion: how to sup­port the grow­ing num­ber of el­derly and give them mean­ing­ful lives; how to struc­ture in­sur­ance and schemes to ac­count for longer life­spans. Will there be enough pro­duc­tive young people to fund the com­fort­able ex­is­tence of the el­derly? Should na­tions plan for im­mi­gra­tion if the res­i­dent pop­u­la­tion fails to pro­duce enough ba­bies of its own?</p>
    <p>For this rea­son, a study pub­lished last week in The Lancet med­i­cal jour­nal is wor­thy of at­ten­tion. The study by the In­sti­tute for Health Met­rics and Eval­u­a­tion at the Univer­sity of Wash­ing­ton chal­lenges as­ser­tions by United Na­tions de­mog­ra­phers, in­clud­ing one that pro­jected world pop­u­la­tion peak­ing at 10.9 bil­lion by the end of the century, from about 7.8 bil­lion to­day. The study sees the peak at 9.7 bil­lion by 2064, with steady de­clines to 8.8 bil­lion by 2100. By this pro­jec­tion, the num­ber of Thais, Ja­panese, Ital­ians, Spa­niards and people in 19 other na­tions could shrink by more than half. What’s more, China and In­dia could see steep falls in work­ing-age pop­u­la­tion, thus crimp­ing their global eco­nomic clout.</p>
    <p>Un­til the late 1970s, high rates of pop­u­la­tion growth were seen as a bane for de­vel­op­ment. While the think­ing has changed, thanks in part to ad­vances in sci­ence that make the pro­duc­tion, stor­age and dis­tri­bu­tion of food more ef­fi­cient, there is lit­tle doubt that a pop­u­la­tion de­cline pro­jected for the sec­ond half of the century is po­ten­tially good news for the en­vi­ron­ment, from ev­ery­thing to the water ta­ble to carbon emis­sions.</p>
    <p>But chang­ing pop­u­la­tion size and age struc­ture will also pro­foundly im­pact eco­nomics, so­ci­ety and geopol­i­tics. For in­stance, China is fore­cast to be­come the largest econ­omy by 2035 but in the changed sce­nario, the United States will once again re­take the po­si­tion in 2098.</p>
    <p>All these have sig­nif­i­cant ef­fects on growth, markets, in­no­va­tion, tax­a­tion and other ar­eas. As na­tions come round to meet the chal­lenges of fer­til­ity rates that are lower than the re­place­ment level, they have four op­tions: in­crease the fer­til­ity rate by pro­vid­ing cou­ples with a good en­vi­ron­ment to have chil­dren and pur­sue ca­reers; re­strict ac­cess to re­pro­duc­tive health ser­vices; in­crease labour force par­tic­i­pa­tion, es­pe­cially at older ages; and im­mi­gra­tion. The first and third are healthy op­tions, the sec­ond is in­sen­si­tive and the last, po­lit­i­cally prob­lem­atic. Nev­er­the­less, it is time for so­ci­eties to recog­nise the trends and be­gin ac­tions to meet the evolv­ing sce­nario. Forty years is a blink of the eye in civil­i­sa­tional terms.</p>
