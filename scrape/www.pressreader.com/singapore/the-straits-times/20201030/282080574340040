    <p>For­mer South Korean pres­i­dent Lee Myung-bak was or­dered back to prison yes­ter­day as the coun­try’s Supreme Court up­held a 17-year jail term for bribery and em­bez­zle­ment of­fences.</p>
    <p>Lee, a con­ser­va­tive, was pres­i­dent from 2008 to 2013. He had been out on bail await­ing the rul­ing and was not in court for the de­ci­sion. The rul­ing is not sub­ject to fur­ther ap­peal and, at age 78, it means Lee is likely to die in prison un­less he re­ceives a pres­i­den­tial par­don.</p>
    <p>Po­lice were seen at his Seoul home to take him back to prison, but ac­cord­ing to Yonhap news agency, he re­quested a de­lay cit</p>
    <p>ing health rea­sons. He will be taken into cus­tody on Mon­day.</p>
    <p>That will mean all four of South Korea’s liv­ing for­mer pres­i­dents are ei­ther be­hind bars or have served jail terms – of­ten as a re­sult of in­ves­ti­ga­tions be­gun un­der suc­ces­sors who are po­lit­i­cal ri­vals.</p>
    <p>Lee was first con­victed in late 2018 and jailed. An ap­peals court later in­creased his sen­tence to 17 years, but granted him bail pend­ing a fur­ther ap­peal to the na­tion’s high­est court.</p>
    <p>The Supreme Court yes­ter­day up­held his con­vic­tion for em­bez­zling 25.2 bil­lion won (S$30.35 mil­lion) and ac­cept­ing bribes to­talling 9.4 bil­lion won, as well as the 17-year sen­tence. Lee is also sub­ject to a 13 bil­lion won fine and must for­feit as­sets of 5.7 bil­lion won.</p>
    <p>Lee’s con­ser­va­tive suc­ces­sor Park Geun-hye is serv­ing 20 years in jail for bribery and abuse of power af­ter be­ing ousted in 2017 over a cor­rup­tion scan­dal. An­other for­mer leader, the lib­eral Roh Moo-hyun, took his own life af­ter be­ing ques­tioned in a cor­rup­tion probe in­volv­ing his fam­ily.</p>
