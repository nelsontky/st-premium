    <p>A num­ber of banks in Sin­ga­pore han­dled about US$4.5 bil­lion (S$6.13 bil­lion) in sus­pi­cious trans­ac­tions be­tween 2000 and 2017, with DBS, CIMB and Deutsche banks among those that pro­cessed the largest sums of such funds here.</p>
    <p>This is the find­ings of the In­ter­na­tional Con­sor­tium of In­ves­tiga­tive Jour­nal­ists (ICIJ) on leaked files, com­pris­ing so-called sus­pi­cious ac­tiv­ity re­ports, from the Fi­nan­cial Crimes En­force­ment Net­work (FinCEN) in the United States.</p>
    <p>The con­sor­tium noted that in al­most 20 years, Sin­ga­pore re­ceived about US$3 bil­lion and sent US$1.5 bil­lion in 1,781 sus­pi­cious trans­ac­tions.</p>
    <p>The Mon­e­tary Author­ity of Sin­ga­pore said yes­ter­day that it is aware that Sin­ga­pore banks were men­tioned in me­dia re­ports on sus­pi­cious trans­ac­tion re­ports filed with FinCEN.</p>
    <p>Al­though such sus­pi­cious trans­ac­tion re­ports do not im­ply that the trans­ac­tions are il­licit, MAS takes such re­ports very se­ri­ously, said a spokesman.</p>
    <p>“MAS is closely study­ing the in­for­ma­tion in these me­dia re­ports, and will take ap­pro­pri­ate action based on the out­come of our re­view.”</p>
    <p>In all, the ICIJ re­ported on Sun­day that the files con­tained in­for­ma­tion about more than US$2 tril­lion worth of trans­ac­tions be­tween 1999 and 2017, which were flagged by in­ter­nal com­pli­ance de­part­ments of fi­nan­cial in­sti­tu­tions as sus­pi­cious.</p>
    <p>Ex­perts told The Straits Times that fil­ing sus­pi­cious ac­tiv­ity re­ports do not trans­late to wrong­do­ing.</p>
    <p>Fur­ther, banks and fi­nan­cial in­sti­tu­tions are obliged to flag unusual trans­ac­tions so that reg­u­la­tors can fol­low up on them, they added.</p>
    <p>For ex­am­ple, when an ac­count with typ­i­cally small trans­ac­tions gets an unusu­ally large de­posit of money, it would pop up on a bank’s radar, they noted.</p>
    <p>Al­ter­na­tively, if a bank cus­tomer who has $1 mil­lion in his ac­count de­cides to trans­fer all his money to an­other bank, the trans­ac­tion may also show up as “sus­pi­cious”.</p>
    <p>As­so­ciate Pro­fes­sor Lawrence Loh of the Na­tional Univer­sity of Sin­ga­pore Busi­ness School said: “The rev­e­la­tion so far has been more fo­cused on the move­ments rather than the ap­pli­ca­tions of the funds.”</p>
    <p>In Sin­ga­pore, the Com­mer­cial Af­fairs De­part­ment (CAD) pub­lishes in its an­nual re­port the num­ber of sus­pi­cious trans­ac­tion re­ports it re­ceives. The CAD is the po­lice unit that deals with white-col­lar crime.</p>
    <p>Its Sus­pi­cious Trans­ac­tion Re­port­ing Of­fice re­ceived 32,660 re­ports in 2018, down 8 per cent from 35,471 re­ports in 2017, ac­cord­ing to its 2018 an­nual re­port.</p>
    <p>The re­port shows banks filed the most num­ber of sus­pi­cious trans­ac­tion re­ports: 16,314. Casi­nos came next with 6,510, fol­lowed by money-chang­ers and re­mit­tance agents with 4,823.</p>
    <p>The con­sor­tium on Sun­day re­leased a list of banks in Sin­ga­pore in­volved in the al­legedly il­licit trans­fers, based on more than 2,100 re­ports amount­ing to some $35 bil­lion, that were filed by about 90 fi­nan­cial in­sti­tu­tions.</p>
    <p>A re­port, how­ever, may con­tain mul­ti­ple trans­ac­tions.</p>
    <p>The list “dis­plays cases where suf­fi­cient de­tails about both the orig­i­na­tor and ben­e­fi­ciary banks</p>
    <p>were avail­able, and is de­signed to il­lus­trate how po­ten­tially dirty money flows from coun­try to coun­try around the world, via US-based banks”, said the con­sor­tium.</p>
    <p>The ICIJ re­ported that five global banks ap­peared most of­ten in the leaked doc­u­ments: HSBC, JPMor­gan, Deutsche, Stan­dard Char­tered and Bank of New York Mel­lon.</p>
    <p>In Sin­ga­pore, DBS was listed as hav­ing sent US$596.8 mil­lion and re­ceived US$228.3 mil­lion in 461 sus­pi­cious trans­ac­tions be­tween 2000 and 2017.</p>
    <p>For CIMB, it sent US$250.4 mil­lion and re­ceived US$34.3 mil­lion in 294 such trans­ac­tions, while</p>
    <p>Deutsche sent US$224.3 mil­lion and re­ceived US$62 mil­lion in 19 sus­pi­cious trans­ac­tions.</p>
    <p>DBS told The Straits Times it has “zero tol­er­ance for bad ac­tors abus­ing the fi­nan­cial sys­tem” and will col­lab­o­rate with the au­thor­i­ties to seize the funds and dis­rupt crim­i­nal net­works.</p>
    <p>Be­sides sanc­tion­ing names or freez­ing spe­cific ac­counts, “it is gen­er­ally very dif­fi­cult to de­lay or in­ter­cept money in tran­sit given the im­pact on le­git­i­mate busi­ness”, the bank said.</p>
    <p>Hence, the nor­mal process, which hap­pens be­hind the scenes, “in­volves sub­se­quent in­ves­ti­ga­tions to es­tab­lish sus­pi­cion, based</p>
    <p>on which the nec­es­sary action is taken”, its spokesman added.</p>
    <p>CIMB told ST it “op­er­ates in com­pli­ance with the anti-money laun­der­ing laws, reg­u­la­tions and guide­lines is­sued by the Mon­e­tary Author­ity of Sin­ga­pore”.</p>
    <p>The bank is in­ves­ti­gat­ing the mat­ter, its spokesman said.</p>
    <p>Deutsche said it has in­vested bil­lions of dol­lars to sup­port the au­thor­i­ties in this ef­fort. “Nat­u­rally this leads to in­creased de­tec­tion lev­els.”</p>
    <p>It added: “We are very fo­cused on meet­ing our re­spon­si­bil­i­ties and obli­ga­tions.”</p>
