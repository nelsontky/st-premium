    <p>“Christ­mas trees?”</p>
    <p>“Trees sell­ing fast,” snaps a sales as­sis­tant on the tele­phone from Lim Hock Swee, a long-time haunt for all man­ner of fes­tive dec­o­ra­tions in Gey­lang.</p>
    <p>“Dec­o­ra­tions also go­ing, go­ing,” she adds in Singlish, be­fore cut­ting me off abruptly.</p>
    <p>Un­de­terred, I thumb through my dig­i­tal Rolodex and check with other Christ­mas go-to stores such as Far East Flora, Ikea, Ma­sons Home Decor and Vanda Win.</p>
    <p>Per­haps it has been such a dreary year that peo­ple are pulling out all the stops to show their fes­tive cheer, but stores which sell trees – both real and ar­ti­fi­cial – are do­ing brisk busi­ness. Many told The Straits Times that stocks are ei­ther sold out or dwin­dling fast.</p>
    <p>Vanda Win at Kinex shop­ping mall in Tan­jong Ka­tong Road has stopped tak­ing on­line or­ders for its syn­thetic trees and is cur­rently at­tend­ing to only walk-in cus­tomers at its store.</p>
    <p>“We can­not cope be­cause most of our stocks are sold out,” says a spokesman for the store, which was es­tab­lished in 1976.</p>
    <p>With more fam­i­lies hun­ker­ing down at home for the year-end hol­i­days due to travel re­stric­tions aris­ing from the coro­n­avirus pan­demic, fes­tive decor ideas will be a hot topic.</p>
    <p>The Straits Times speaks to an in­te­ri­ors stylist and three in­di­vid­u­als to find out how they will be jazz­ing up their trees and homes this Christ­mas.</p>
    <p>THE MORE, THE MER­RIER</p>
    <p>If you can­not get a real tree, in­vest in a high-qual­ity, solid ar­ti­fi­cial tree with dense fo­liage to set off the Christ­mas am­bi­ence, says Ms Ju­liane Bai­ley, an in­te­ri­ors stylist and founder of The Jun­gle Em­po­rium, a life­style bou­tique launched last month.</p>
    <p>“Christ­mas is par­tic­u­larly im­por­tant to me, so I typ­i­cally set up two trees in my home: a large 8-foot-tall fake tree which I dec­o­rate at an early stage around the last week of Novem­ber and a smaller real Christ­mas tree which I set up closer to Christ­mas,” says Ms Bai­ley, whose shop of­fers a cu­rated se­lec­tion of hand­made ob­jects amassed dur­ing her global trav­els.</p>
    <p>“This is to en­sure that it sur­vives the fes­tive sea­son in Sin­ga­pore’s trop­i­cal weather and to ob­tain the un­mis­tak­able scent of a real fir tree,” adds the 40-year-old en­tre­pre­neur, who lives in a sprawl­ing black-and-white bun­ga­low in</p>
    <p>Adam Drive where she also op­er­ates her bou­tique.</p>
    <p>“Place the real tree close to your din­ing ta­ble to en­joy the smell of the fir tree while din­ing.”</p>
    <p>De­cid­ing on a theme and colour code for your tree and ad­her­ing to it are im­por­tant, says the fash­ion jour­nal­ism grad­u­ate from Ham­burg’s Akademie Mode & De­sign.</p>
    <p>“My theme for this year is In­dian Trop­i­cal Christ­mas and my colour code is green and pink to match The Jun­gle Em­po­rium’s colours.”</p>
    <p>In ad­di­tion to or­na­ments and baubles, she sug­gests dec­o­rat­ing the tree with lots of home­made bows.</p>
    <p>“Be gen­er­ous with your tree dec­o­ra­tions. I like my trees hang­ing full of or­na­ments, baubles and bows – the more the mer­rier,” says the mother of a daugh­ter, aged nine, and a five-year-old son.</p>
    <p>A big no in her books is reusing old dec­o­ra­tions. “Old or­na­ments are out as you need to keep to your new theme and colour code for both your tree and in­te­rior decor,”</p>
    <p>says Ms Bai­ley, who ad­vises think­ing of themes and colour schemes as early as pos­si­ble.</p>
    <p>“I al­ready have a theme for next year in mind. I’m think­ing of clas­si­cal Ger­man hand-blown glass or­na­ments to set the tone.”</p>
    <p>BRING­ING THE OUT­DOORS IN­DOORS</p>
    <p>De­cid­ing on a strong theme this year for Christ­mas came eas­ily for Mr Reg­gie Pryor.</p>
    <p>The 35-year-old in­vest­ment man­ager launched his de­but jazz al­bum Love An­thol­ogy in Oc­to­ber, and has decked out his tree with an­i­mal shapes to re­mind him of his trav­els which helped in­spire his choice of songs for his al­bum.</p>
    <p>“I find my­self drawn to all things retro this year, like walk­ing on the beach dur­ing my trav­els in past years and the nos­tal­gic vibes of jazz greats such as John Coltrane and Nat King Cole,” says the Sin­ga­pore-based In­done­sian ex­pa­tri­ate.</p>
    <p>The an­i­mal mo­tifs on his tree, he</p>
    <p>says, also “help to bring the out­doors in­doors”.</p>
    <p>“The em­broi­dered silk or­na­ments i n the form of corals, starfish and shells, as well as doves and tigers, re­mind me of preCovid-19 days when I had hol­i­days on beau­ti­ful beaches or up in the moun­tains ap­pre­ci­at­ing na­ture.”</p>
    <p>KEEP­ING IT NICE AND WARM</p>
    <p>For Ja­panese home­maker Yuko Tanaka, 36, and her Sin­ga­porean hus­band Tan Wen Yang, 40, Christ­mas this year is hinged on a nat­u­ral theme.</p>
    <p>“We wanted to keep our tree nat­u­ral to fit our sim­ple wooden Ja­panese Muji-themed home,” says Ms Tanaka. The cou­ple ren­o­vated their five-room Hous­ing Board flat in Pung­gol last year to in­clude open spa­ces fea­tur­ing lots of warm woods and also to dou­ble as a play­ground for their two young daugh­ters, aged four and seven.</p>
    <p>“The Christ­mas sea­son it­self ex­udes warmth, so we lim­ited the or­na­ment colours to red and gold, with warm lights,” says Ms Tanaka, who bought her ar­ti­fi­cial Christ­mas tree from Ma­sons Home Decor.</p>
    <p>“It’s also be­come a favourite spot for our pet rab­bit,” she says.</p>
    <p>DREAM­ING OF A WHITE CHRIST­MAS</p>
    <p>Bridal de­signer and flo­ral artist Jes­si­cacindy takes in­spi­ra­tion from a white Christ­mas this year. She has cre­ated a “Christ­mas vil­lage” in­stal­la­tion at the head­quar­ters of her hus­band’s co-work­ing busi­ness, JustCo.</p>
    <p>“I look for­ward to De­cem­ber each year be­cause Christ­mas has al­ways been my favourite fes­tive sea­son,” says the 32-year-old In­done­sian.</p>
    <p>She runs two busi­nesses, an epony­mous bridal de­sign stu­dio, and Merci Matisse, a flo­ral bou­tique that spe­cialises in sculp­tural ar­range­ments for pri­vate func­tions and cor­po­rate clients.</p>
    <p>Ms Jes­si­cacindy says she draws on her time in Switzer­land dur­ing sev­eral trips in past years to cre­ate a white-themed Christ­mas vil­lage in­stal­la­tion, com­plete with mini fir trees and repli­cas of Euro­pean houses dusted gen­er­ously with syn­thetic snow.</p>
    <p>“De­spite the Covid-19 sit­u­a­tion, this year’s Christ­mas will be even more spe­cial as now, more than ever, I feel that ev­ery mo­ment we have with our cher­ished ones is spe­cial and should be trea­sured for all time.”</p>
