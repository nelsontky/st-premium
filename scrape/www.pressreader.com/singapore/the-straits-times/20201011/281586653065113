    <p>WASH­ING­TON The US Cen­tres for Dis­ease Con­trol and Preven­tion (CDC) drafted a sweep­ing or­der last month re­quir­ing all pas­sen­gers and em­ploy­ees to wear masks on all forms of pub­lic and com­mer­cial trans­porta­tion in the United States, but it was blocked by the White House, ac­cord­ing to two fed­eral health of­fi­cials.</p>
    <p>The or­der would have been the tough­est fed­eral man­date to date aimed at curb­ing the spread of Covid-19, which con­tin­ues to in­fect more than 40,000 Amer­i­cans a day.</p>
    <p>The of­fi­cials said it was drafted un­der the agency’s “quar­an­tine pow­ers” and had the sup­port of Sec­re­tary of Health and Hu­man Ser­vices Alex Azar, but the White House coro­n­avirus task force, led by Vice-Pres­i­dent Mike Pence, de­clined to even dis­cuss it.</p>
    <p>The two of­fi­cials, who spoke on con­di­tion of anonymity be­cause they were not au­tho­rised to com­ment, said the or­der would have re­quired face cov­er­ings on air­planes, trains, buses and sub­ways, and in tran­sit hubs such as air­ports, train sta­tions and bus de­pots.</p>
    <p>A task force of­fi­cial said the de­ci­sion to re­quire masks should be left up to states and lo­cal­i­ties.</p>
    <p>The ad­min­is­tra­tion re­quires the task force to sign off on coro­n­avirus­re­lated poli­cies.</p>
    <p>“The ap­proach the task force has taken with any mask man­date is, the re­sponse in New York City is dif­fer­ent than in Mon­tana, or Tuscaloosa, Alabama,” said the of­fi­cial.</p>
    <p>“Lo­cal and state au­thor­i­ties need to de­ter­mine the best ap­proach for their re­spon­sive ef­fort de­pend­ing on how the coro­n­avirus is im­pact­ing their area.”</p>
    <p>Most pub­lic health of­fi­cials be­lieve that wear­ing masks is one of the most ef­fec­tive ways to pro­tect against the spread of the virus, par­tic­u­larly in crowded, poorly ven­ti­lated pub­lic places that at­tract peo­ple from all over, like trans­porta­tion venues.</p>
    <p>Many feel that the Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion has turned the wear­ing – or not wear­ing – of masks into a po­lit­i­cal ex­pres­sion, as seen most dra­mat­i­cally last Mon­day evening when US Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump whipped off his sur­gi­cal mask at the White House door af­ter re­turn­ing from the hos­pi­tal where he was treated for Covid-19.</p>
    <p>“I think masks are the most pow­er­ful weapon we have to con­front Covid-19 and we all need to em­brace masks and set the ex­am­ple for each other,” Dr Robert Red­field, the CDC di­rec­tor, who over­saw the draft­ing of the or­der, said in a re­cent in­ter­view.</p>
