    <p>Philip­pine law­mak­ers elected a new House Speaker yesterday, end­ing a pro­tracted lead­er­ship bat­tle that was threat­en­ing to de­lay the pas­sage of a bud­get vi­tal to re­build­ing the coun­try’s bat­tered econ­omy.</p>
    <p>A sim­mer­ing row in the Philip­pine Congress that threat­ened to stall the coun­try’s re­sponse to the Covid-19 pan­demic ended yesterday, with law­mak­ers al­lied with the pow­er­ful daugh­ter of Pres­i­dent Ro­drigo Duterte of­fi­cially nam­ing a new Speaker of the House of Rep­re­sen­ta­tives.</p>
    <p>Rep­re­sen­ta­tive Lord Al­lan Velasco was elected House Speaker by a ma­jor­ity of law­mak­ers who at­tended a ple­nary ses­sion just be­fore noon, forc­ing his ri­val, Mr Alan Cayetano, to ten­der his “ir­rev­o­ca­ble res­ig­na­tion” as sup­port for him col­lapsed.</p>
    <p>Mr Cayetano apol­o­gised to Mr Duterte in a Face­book post for the tur­moil on Mon­day when he re­fused to leave of­fice, say­ing he fought it out with Mr Velasco be­cause he “mis­read” the Pres­i­dent’s in­ten­tions.</p>
    <p>He said he thought Mr Duterte wanted him to stay on as Speaker till next year’s na­tional bud­get – which has a slew of mea­sures to ad­dress the pan­demic – could be ap­proved.</p>
    <p>“It was not my in­ten­tion... not to fol­low you,” he told Mr Duterte.</p>
    <p>Mr Velasco, 42, shortly af­ter he was named Speaker, took jabs at Mr Cayetano, 49, blam­ing him for the “un­nec­es­sary” tur­moil ear­lier.</p>
    <p>The tensions in Congress stalled de­lib­er­a­tions on the bud­get which, among other things, sets aside more than 2.5 bil­lion pe­sos (S$69.8 mil­lion) for the pur­chase of a Covid-19 vac­cine and 26 bil­lion pe­sos for pro­tec­tive gear and var­i­ous forms of as­sis­tance for poor pa­tients.</p>
    <p>It also ear­marks funds meant to stim­u­late the Philip­pine econ­omy, which has fallen into a deep re­ces­sion, with bil­lions of dol­lars’ worth of in­fra­struc­ture projects and other gov­ern­ment spend­ing in limbo.</p>
    <p>“The mes­sage has been re­ceived that the pri­or­ity is the bud­get, not pol­i­tics,” Mr Duterte’s spokesman Harry Roque told re­porters yesterday.</p>
    <p>Mr Cayetano was sup­posed to re­lin­quish the speak­er­ship to Mr Velasco to­day un­der a “gen­tle­man’s agree­ment” en­gi­neered by Mr Duterte. The deal, which was needed to keep the Pres­i­dent’s su­per­ma­jor­ity in Congress in­tact, al­lowed Mr Cayetano to take the helm of the House for 15 months and Mr Velasco to take over till the na­tional elec­tion next year.</p>
    <p>But Mr Cayetano re­fused to step down. He claimed Mr Duterte wanted him to stay on till the ap­proval of the na­tional bud­get that is slated for next month.</p>
    <p>The for­mer Speaker’s hand, though, was forced when Mr Duterte’s daugh­ter, Davao City Mayor Sara Duterte-Car­pio, stepped in to so­lid­ify sup­port among law­mak­ers for Mr Velasco.</p>
    <p>Pun­dits said the feud be­tween Mr</p>
    <p>Velasco and Mr Cayetano, who both have close ties to Mr Duterte, was re­ally about money and Ms Duterte­Car­pio’s out­size po­lit­i­cal in­flu­ence.</p>
    <p>Mr Velasco’s al­lies had crit­i­cised Mr Cayetano for ear­mark­ing sig­nif­i­cantly more in­fra­struc­ture funds for him­self, his wife – who is also a con­gress­man – and his po­lit­i­cal al­lies.</p>
    <p>Ms Duterte-Car­pio had in 2018 en­gi­neered the ouster of another House Speaker, Mr Pan­ta­leon Al­varez, who took is­sue with her grow­ing po­lit­i­cal clout.</p>
    <p>Mr Duterte later re­vealed that his daugh­ter thought Mr Al­varez was ma­noeu­vring to oust him.</p>
    <p>Ms Duterte-Car­pio’s lat­est in­ter­ven­tion in the fight for the Speaker’s post is seen as fur­ther ce­ment­ing her path to­wards re­plac­ing her fa­ther when he steps down as pres­i­dent in 2022.</p>
    <p>It shows she can rally dis­parate par­ties with dif­fer­ent agen­das be­hind her, which will be cru­cial in crush­ing chal­lengers and keep­ing her fa­ther’s coali­tion in­tact when she fi­nally de­cides to run for the na­tion’s top of­fice.</p>
    <p>Ms Duterte-Car­pio helmed a coali­tion that de­liv­ered a near-sweep of the Se­nate race last year.</p>
