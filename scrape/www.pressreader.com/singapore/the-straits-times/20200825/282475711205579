    <p>Covid-19 has caused plenty of dis­rup­tion, but for some Lasalle Col­lege of the Arts staff and alumni, it has also been a time for cre­ativ­ity to flour­ish amid con­straints.</p>
    <p>Their re­cent projects – from photos and an an­i­ma­tion of the si­lent city dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker to text or video commentari­es on the pan­demic – can now be found on an on­line plat­form known as Im­age And Sound In Spite Of.</p>
    <p>“It is ed­u­ca­tional to see what other col­leagues and artists are do­ing in this sit­u­a­tion in spite of Covid-19,” said Lasalle’s se­nior fel­low Milenko Prvacki, who launched the plat­form to keep artis­tic con­ver­sa­tions go­ing af­ter the school’s in­ter­na­tional art camp was can­celled.</p>
    <p>So far, about 50 staff, alumni and for­mer par­tic­i­pants of the Tropical Lab art camp have been fea­tured.</p>
    <p>Au­dio pro­duc­tion lec­turer Dirk Stromberg, 41, one of the par­tic­i­pat­ing artists, cre­ated a video work us­ing la­tency and in­duced feed­back sounds from Zoom.</p>
    <p>Stromberg, who missed hav­ing a more col­lab­o­ra­tive process of art­mak­ing, said: “Hav­ing sat through many cur­ricu­lum dis­cus­sion ses­sions where the la­tency and au­dio arte­facts of Zoom were lamented, it came to me then – I could use the la­tency to cre­ate a du­pli­cate ver­sion of my­self and the arte­facts to cre­ate sub­tle vari­a­tions of my own play­ing.”</p>
    <p>In mu­sic pro­duc­tion, an “arte­fact” is a type of sonic ma­te­rial that is ac­ci­den­tal or un­wanted.</p>
    <p>He added: “Through some prac­tice, I dis­cov­ered how to ma­nip­u­late the noise sup­pres­sion al­go­rithms in Zoom to cre­ate vari­a­tion.”</p>
    <p>Painter Khair­uld­din Wa­hab, 30, turned to a new medium dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker pe­riod when he could no longer ac­cess his Good­man Arts Cen­tre stu­dio.</p>
    <p>Bereft of his usual art sup­plies, he started paint­ing dig­i­tally on his iPad us­ing an app known as</p>
    <p>Pro­cre­ate – and the re­sult is a se­ries of dig­i­tal paint­ings ex­plor­ing the ideas of colo­nial­ism and the dis­en­chant­ment of na­ture.</p>
    <p>“It’s some­thing I’d al­ready been plan­ning, but (the cir­cuit breaker) made it more press­ing,” said the Lasalle alum­nus of his foray into dig­i­tal paint­ing.</p>
    <p>He added that the app has ben­e­fited his art prac­tice, making it more con­ve­nient to sketch out ideas be­fore do­ing the ac­tual paint­ing on can­vas.</p>
    <p>Prvacki, who plans to get more artists’ works fea­tured on the web­site, told The Straits Times he was struck by how in­no­va­tive the par­tic­i­pants were.</p>
    <p>“Many of them changed their medium. They started to find new av­enues to cre­ate works. This could be a start­ing point for some of them to move be­yond tra­di­tional ways of pre­sent­ing art,” he said.</p>
