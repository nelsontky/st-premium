    <p>JAKARTA • At least 11 peo­ple were killed, in­clud­ing a six-year-old boy, and scores more were miss­ing after deadly land­slides hit In­done­sia’s West Java prov­ince, the au­thor­i­ties said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Tor­ren­tial rain trig­gered the dis­as­ter on Satur­day evening in the town of Sumedang, where a sec­ond land­slide buried res­i­dents and a res­cue team that had been search­ing for the ini­tial vic­tims, said Ban­dung res­cue agency spokesman Seni Wu­lan­dari.</p>
    <p>“We’re still doc­u­ment­ing how many are miss­ing after the sec­ond land­slide be­cause there were many peo­ple who joined the orig­i­nal res­cue ef­fort,” Ms Wu­lan­dari said. At least one sur­vivor was se­ri­ously in­jured, while 11 peo­ple were con­firmed dead, she added.</p>
    <p>The Na­tional Dis­as­ter Mit­i­ga­tion Agency said in a state­ment that rescuers were among the 11 peo­ple who had died, and there were 18 peo­ple in­jured.</p>
    <p>A bridge was de­stroyed and sev­eral roads were cut off, it said.</p>
    <p>Fa­tal land­slides and flash floods are com­mon across the In­done­sian ar­chi­pel­ago, where sea­sonal down­pours are fre­quent and re­lent­less.</p>
    <p>In Septem­ber last year, at least 11 peo­ple were killed in land­slides on Bor­neo is­land, and a few months ear­lier, land­slides in Su­lawesi killed dozens.</p>
    <p>In­done­sia’s dis­as­ter agency has es­ti­mated that 125 mil­lion In­done­sians – nearly half the coun­try’s pop­u­la­tion – live in ar­eas at risk of land­slides.</p>
