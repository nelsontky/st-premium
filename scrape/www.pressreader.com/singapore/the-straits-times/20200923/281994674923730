    <p>Less than a month af­ter the sink­ing of the MV Gulf Live­stock 1, who in the world mourns Cap­tain Dante Ad­dug and his 38 fel­low Filipino crew mem­bers, lost when their ship sank off the coast of Ja­pan dur­ing Typhoon Maysak?</p>
    <p>Their fam­i­lies, cer­tainly.</p>
    <p>Cap­tain Ad­dug, who was 34, had five chil­dren un­der six years of age. The staff and man­age­ment of the Dubai-based Gulf Nav­i­ga­tion, the ship’s op­er­a­tors, have also been hit hard by the hu­man cost of the tragedy.</p>
    <p>As for the rest of the world, while de­tails have emerged about the two Aus­tralians and two New Zealan­ders who were on board, we know next to noth­ing of the 39 Filipino sailors who lost their lives along­side them when their ship was over­whelmed on Sept 2.</p>
    <p>Filipinos – calm, ca­pa­ble, rugged sailors – are the back­bone of the world’s mar­itime com­merce sys­tem. I ex­pe­ri­enced their tough, good-hu­moured, com­pe­tent brand of sea­man­ship when I was hauled to safety from a life-raft in the At­lantic on to the deck of a cargo ship crewed by Filipinos. So, when I read of the sink­ing of Gulf Live­stock 1 and the loss of al­most all its crew in such hor­ren­dous cir­cum­stances, it was the faces of the Filipino sailors who had saved me and my three com­pan­ions that I saw, grin­ning and shout­ing en­cour­age­ment as they fought to pull four cold and ex­hausted English­men from the maw of a fe­ro­cious storm.</p>
    <p>That new com­puter, iPhone, din­ner set, drill, ket­tle or TV you or­dered on­line may have ar­rived at your door in an Ama­zon box dis­patched from a de­pot near you. But the great­est part of its jour­ney – typ­i­cally from some fac­tory in China – was on board a ship and fre­quently in the care of a crew of Filipinos work­ing far from home in a per­ilous en­vi­ron­ment.</p>
    <p>Few of us who spend our lives on solid ground ap­pre­ci­ate just how per­ilous that en­vi­ron­ment can be. Al­though we all ben­e­fit from the prod­ucts of the global econ­omy on a daily ba­sis, we rarely give any thought to how those prod­ucts reach us. The world of com­mer­cial ship­ping upon which the global mar­ket de­pends com­pletely is a mys­tery. The ships that ser­vice our con­sumerism are, at best, lit­tle more than smudges on the hori­zon, indis­tinct shapes glimpsed oc­ca­sion­ally dur­ing a day trip to the coast.</p>
    <p>Yet more than 90 per cent of world trade is wa­ter­borne. As the lat­est Global Ma­rine Trends re­port from Lloyd’s Reg­is­ter puts it: “With­out ships and nav­i­ga­ble seas there is no glob­al­i­sa­tion.”</p>
    <p>Most of us nei­ther know nor care much about what it takes to ship the stuff we take for granted. Like­wise, the lives and losses of those who labour to keep the great en­gine of global trade running ef­fi­ciently are out of sight and out of mind.</p>
    <p>Last year, 41 large com­mer­cial ves­sels were lost at sea. That’s cer­tainly an im­prove­ment on the 130 lost in 2010, but such trends are highly volatile and sub­ject to both eco­nomic and nat­u­ral forces. A to­tal of 951 ships were lost be­tween 2010 and 2019 – a star­tling av­er­age of 95 ev­ery year. Of these, 228 went down off south­ern China, In­dochina, In­done­sia and the Philip­pines.</p>
    <p>Ty­phoons, com­bined with the ever-in­creas­ing vol­ume of traf­fic from the re­gion, have made this the No. 1 dan­ger zone for ship­ping. Dan­ger also lurks else­where. Since 2010, 49 ships have been lost in or near the Ara­bian Gulf.</p>
    <p>Gulf Live­stock 1, which was car­ry­ing al­most 6,000 cat­tle des­tined for the Chi­nese dairy in­dus­try, sank near the end of its voy­age from Napier in New Zealand to the port of Tang­shan, a jour­ney of about 17 days. A dis­tress call was sent but only two of the crew were found alive.</p>
    <p>Chief of­fi­cer Ed­uardo Sareno was spot­ted by a Ja­panese navy air­craft and res­cued. He was found alone in the wa­ter wear­ing a life jacket, hav­ing jumped off the ship as it be­gan to cap­size. He told res­cuers that the ves­sel’s en­gine had failed in the rough seas and the ship had turned broad­side and cap­sized.</p>
    <p>A sec­ond crew mem­ber, found two days later, died shortly af­ter res­cue. A third, a 30-year-old deck­hand found cling­ing to a bat­tered, wa­ter­logged life-raft later the same day, sur­vived. An empty, badly dam­aged lifeboat has also been found, along with the car­casses of dozens of cat­tle. At sun­set on Sept 9, one week af­ter the ship went down, the search for sur­vivors was fi­nally called off.</p>
    <p>En­cour­aged by the fact that three life-rafts and a lifeboat have yet to be found, fam­i­lies and sup­port­ers have mounted a cam­paign on so­cial me­dia to urge that search and res­cue ef­forts be con­tin­ued. One heartbreak­ing pho­to­graph shows a girl of about eight hold­ing up a sign that reads: “I am a daugh­ter. Save Cap­tain Dante Ad­dug and his crew mem­bers.”</p>
    <p>On Sept 9, the day the search for sur­vivors was called off, Gulf Nav­i­ga­tion re­leased a state­ment say­ing that ev­ery­one in the com­pany was “dev­as­tated by the enor­mity of this tragic ac­ci­dent”, adding: “All our thoughts and prayers at this time go out to the fam­i­lies of those who it seems have lost their loved ones.”</p>
    <p>As for the rest of us, the least we can do the next time we take de­liv­ery of a par­cel whose con­tents have trav­elled the world is pause and re­mem­ber those who are daily in peril on the seas and who at times give their lives, so we may ben­e­fit from the global trade upon which our life­styles de­pend.</p>
