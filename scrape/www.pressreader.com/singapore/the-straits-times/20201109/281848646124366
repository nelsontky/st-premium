    <p>LONDON Global un­cer­tainty and anx­i­ety amid the eco­nomic cri­sis caused by the coro­n­avirus pan­demic could risk an­other world war, the head of Bri­tain’s armed forces has warned.</p>
    <p>In an in­ter­view aired yes­ter­day to co­in­cide with Re­mem­brance Sun­day, the an­nual com­mem­o­ra­tions for those killed and wounded in con­flict, Mr Nick Carter, Bri­tain’s Chief of the De­fence Staff, said an es­ca­la­tion in re­gional ten­sions and er­rors of judg­ment could ul­ti­mately lead to widespread con­flict.</p>
    <p>“I think we are liv­ing at a mo­ment in time where the world is a very un­cer­tain and anx­ious place and, of course, the dy­namic of global com­pe­ti­tion is a fea­ture of our lives as well, and I think the real risk we have with quite a lot of the re­gional con­flicts that are gong on at the mo­ment, is you could see es­ca­la­tion lead to mis­cal­cu­la­tion,” he told Sky News.</p>
    <p>Asked if that meant there was a gen­uine threat of an­other world war, Mr Carter replied: “I’m say­ing it’s a risk and we need to be con­scious of those risks.”</p>
    <p>Mr Carter, who be­came the Bri­tish mil­i­tary chief in 2018, said it was im­por­tant to re­mem­ber those who had died in pre­vi­ous wars as a warn­ing to those who might repeat past mis­takes.</p>
    <p>“If you for­get about the hor­ror of war, then the great risk, I think, is that peo­ple might think that go­ing to war is a rea­son­able thing to do,” he said.</p>
    <p>“We have to re­mem­ber that his­tory might not repeat it­self but it has a rhythm, and if you look back at the last cen­tury, be­fore both world wars, I think it was unar­guable that there was es­ca­la­tion which led to the mis­cal­cu­la­tion which ul­ti­mately led to war at a scale we would hope­fully never see again.”</p>
