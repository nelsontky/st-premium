    <p>TOLEDO (Ohio) • Danielle Kang has a for­mula for suc­cess – hav­ing trust in her abil­i­ties, mix­ing it with pa­tience and top­ping it off with re­spect­ing the golf course.</p>
    <p>The Amer­i­can used those traits to good ef­fect when she held off France’s Ce­line Boutier over the fi­nal holes on Sun­day to win the LPGA Drive On Cham­pi­onship, the Tour’s first tour­na­ment since Fe­bru­ary af­ter the Covid-19 shut­down.</p>
    <p>It was the fourth ca­reer ti­tle for the 27-year-old, whose first win was a Ma­jor at the 2017 Women’s PGA Cham­pi­onship.</p>
    <p>The fi­nal round at driz­zly In­ver­ness Club in Ohio be­gan with Kang, Boutier and Bri­tain’s Jodi Ewart Shad­off all shar­ing the lead and ended in sun­shine with Kang on top af­ter card­ing a two-un­der 70.</p>
    <p>Tough scor­ing all week saw only five play­ers fin­ish un­der par, and Kang’s seven-un­der 209 to­tal was enough to earn the world No. 4 a one-stroke win over Boutier.</p>
    <p>“I think just keep­ing pa­tience and trust­ing all as­pects of your golf game brings it out,” she said.</p>
    <p>“And you have got to re­spect the golf course. Even lit­tle putts I didn’t take it for granted.</p>
    <p>“I kept telling my­self, stick to the game plan. The game plan was to play ag­gres­sive and play my game.”</p>
    <p>Boutier, who missed a four-foot birdie putt on the last hole that would have forced a play-off, was alone in se­cond af­ter a clos­ing 71.</p>
    <p>Aus­tralian Min­jee Lee (70) was third on 212, Ja­pan’s Yui Kawamoto (72) fourth on 213 and Ewart Shad­off fifth on 214 af­ter a clos­ing 75.</p>
    <p>Work­ing on an er­ror-free day, Kang opened up a three-shot cush­ion at the 11th be­fore things be­gan to tighten. Boutier rolled in a seven-foot birdie putt at the par­four 14th to join her atop the leader­board.</p>
    <p>The French­woman was the first to blink with a bo­gey at the par­four 15th while Kang held her nerve till the fin­ish with four straight pars.</p>
    <p>The come­back event, held with­out spec­ta­tors on the host course for next year’s Sol­heim Cup, was played ahead of next week’s LPGA Marathon Clas­sic in nearby Syl­va­nia so play­ers could stay in the same area for both events, eas­ing con­cerns about con­tract­ing Covid-19.</p>
    <p>There were so­cial dis­tanc­ing pro­to­cols that were ap­par­ent on the 18th green as Kang cel­e­brated her win. Friends wear­ing masks poured cham­pagne on her while she made hug­ging ges­tures with her arms. But she em­braced the oc­ca­sion nonethe­less.</p>
