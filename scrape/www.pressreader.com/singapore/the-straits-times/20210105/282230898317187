    <p>Se­lected karaoke out­lets may be al­lowed to re­open with­out their cus­tomers need­ing to take a Covid-19 swab test as part of a pi­lot pro­gramme, the Min­istry of Home Af­fairs (MHA) has said.</p>
    <p>But these out­lets must ob­serve a dif­fer­ent set of rules – such as a max­i­mum group size of two and a ban on liquor con­sump­tion, an MHA spokesman told The New Pa­per last week.</p>
    <p>On Nov 6 last year, KTV out­lets – closed since March 26 – were told that some could re­open un­der a three-month pi­lot pro­gramme, but that cus­tomers must test neg­a­tive on an anti­gen rapid test or a poly­merase chain re­ac­tion test in the 24-hour pe­riod be­fore the end of their KTV ac­tiv­ity.</p>
    <p>The spokesman said MHA and the Min­istry of Trade and In­dus­try (MTI) had en­gaged the KTV sec­tor and re­ceived feed­back seek­ing sep­a­rate safe man­age­ment mea­sures for dif­fer­ent types of KTV op­er­a­tions.</p>
    <p>The min­istries then de­cided that al­ter­na­tive safe man­age­ment mea­sures could be im­posed on a caseby-case ba­sis to achieve the same pub­lic health out­comes.</p>
    <p>The spokesman said: “On a caseby-case ba­sis, MTI may ap­prove karaoke out­lets’ ap­pli­ca­tions to adopt an al­ter­na­tive ar­range­ment for the pi­lot, where no pre-event test­ing will be re­quired for the cus­tomers, but the group size is lim­ited to two per­sons.</p>
    <p>“In ad­di­tion, there must not be any liquor sale or con­sump­tion at all times within the premises.”</p>
    <p>KTV out­lets ap­ply­ing to be part of the pi­lot pro­gramme can choose be­tween this op­tion or the de­fault re­quir­ing cus­tomers to un­dergo Covid-19 test­ing. The de­fault op­tion al­lows out­lets to ac­cept cus­tomers in groups of up to eight and serve al­co­hol un­til 10.30pm.</p>
    <p>No changes will be al­lowed once an out­let re­ceives ap­proval for the op­tion it chose. The pi­lot scheme is ex­pected to start this month.</p>
    <p>Wel­com­ing the move, Miss Lim Ming Zhen, 26, said she would go to a KTV out­let only if she did not need to take a swab test.</p>
    <p>The fi­nan­cial con­sul­tant, who used to fre­quent KTV out­lets once or twice a week, added: “I miss singing karaoke. It is a good so­cial ac­tiv­ity even if it’s just be­tween two peo­ple.”</p>
    <p>Mr Caine Poon, a manag­ing part­ner in Cash Stu­dio Fam­ily Karaoke, said his ob­vi­ous choice for the pi­lot scheme would be the no-test­ing op­tion as the cost of the swab test would de­ter cus­tomers.</p>
    <p>Ex­press­ing his con­cerns about the un­cer­tain fu­ture of the KTV sec­tor amid the pan­demic, he said he has al­ready had to close one out­let in the last 10 months.</p>
    <p>He also said he has yet to re­coup the cost of ren­o­vat­ing some of the group’s other six out­lets over the last two to three years. And three of the out­lets that piv­oted to food and bev­er­age (F&B) have had lit­tle suc­cess.</p>
    <p>In as­sess­ing the pi­lot scheme and be­fore it will con­sider fur­ther re­sump­tion of nightlife ac­tiv­i­ties, the Govern­ment must be sat­is­fied that the safe man­age­ment mea­sures can ad­e­quately mit­i­gate the risk of Covid-19 trans­mis­sion and that the in­dus­try is able to im­ple­ment these mea­sures ef­fec­tively and con­sis­tently, said the MHA spokesman.</p>
    <p>Mr Frank Per, who owns Sing My Song Fam­ily Karaoke, also tried piv­ot­ing his busi­ness to F&B but found that switch­ing sec­tors overnight is not fea­si­ble.</p>
    <p>“Morale has been very low. F&B is com­pet­i­tive and with our lim­ited ex­pe­ri­ence, the odds are very much stacked against us,” he said.</p>
    <p>Mr Per, who is also trea­surer of the Sin­ga­pore En­ter­tain­ment Af­fil­i­a­tion which rep­re­sents KTV op­er­a­tors, said the fu­ture will be bleak for most out­lets that are still pay­ing rent and salaries if they are not able to re­open soon.</p>
    <p>“While the pi­lot pro­gramme is a small step in the right di­rec­tion, we are not sure what the fu­ture holds,” he said.</p>
    <p>“No­body ex­pected the clo­sure to last for so long, and it has left many of the karaoke op­er­a­tors wor­ried. If it con­tin­ues like this, sev­eral more out­lets will close down.”</p>
