    <p>Three Buns By Potato Head Info: three­buns.com/ sin­ga­pore</p>
    <p>To serve de­liv­ery cus­tomers in the area faster, burger restau­rant Three Buns set up a new kitchen in Or­chard Road last month. The kitchen churns out or­ders made via food de­liv­ery plat­form De­liv­eroo.</p>
    <p>The restau­rant in Robert­son Quay, part of F&B group Potato Head, in­tro­duced is­land-wide de­liv­ery at the start of the cir­cuit breaker and saw or­ders on De­liv­eroo triple last month, com­pared with Jan­uary.</p>
    <p>It is also on other plat­forms – Od­dle, Food­panda and GrabFood.</p>
    <p>To en­cour­age more de­liv­ery or take­away or­ders, group ex­ec­u­tive</p>
    <p>Kimly Group Info:</p>
    <p>chef Adam Pen­ney also of­fers a $19 set lunch, which in­cludes a burger or dawg (hot dog), fries or salad, and lemon­ade or a soft drink.</p>
    <p>He says: “We knew we had to be flex­i­ble and quick to adapt our busi­ness model, to han­dle more take­away and de­liv­ery or­ders, in ad­di­tion to im­prov­ing the fea­tures on our web­site.”</p>
    <p>While cop­ing with the chal­lenges brought about by the pan­demic, Three Buns, along with its sis­ter burger restau­rant Potato Head in Keong Saik Road, have not lost track of their sus­tain­abil­ity mis­sion.</p>
    <p>Last month, both out­lets launched a Sus­tain­able Menu, fea­tur­ing plant-based dishes and new brands such as Sim­pli­i­good – kim­ly­group.sg</p>
    <p>Dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker pe­riod, Mr Roy Tan, di­rec­tor of the Kimly Group, which op­er­ates cof­fee shops and zi char stalls, ob­served a “huge spike” in new food de­liv­ery cus­tomers via Food­panda, GrabFood and De­liv­eroo.</p>
    <p>It led to a “sub­stan­tial in­crease” in rev­enue as busi­ness picked up.</p>
    <p>Last month, Kimly’s new cus­tomers on De­liv­eroo grew by three times, while the num­ber of or­ders on the plat­form jumped by al­most four times com­pared with Jan­uary.</p>
    <p>The listed com­pany runs 29 zi char stalls, 59 mixed-rice out­lets and more than 40 dim sum out­lets.</p>
    <p>When dine-in was not al­lowed, Mr Tan, 43, of­ten had to rally the group’s 2,000 em­ploy­ees.</p>
    <p>“I had to have fre­quent brief­ings with the staff and re­mind them that our busi­ness is es­sen­tial. We had to work even harder,” he re­calls.</p>
    <p>Now that dine-in has re­sumed, the com­pany is work­ing on re­fin­ing its prod­ucts, such as of­fer­ing bento op­tions at its mixed-rice stalls and cater­ing meals for smaller groups, since so­cial gath­er­ings are re­stricted to no more than five peo­ple.</p>
    <p>With the brand seen as a more tra­di­tional busi­ness, Mr Tan also em­pha­sises the need to boost its mar­ket­ing and so­cial me­dia pres­ence as well. Con­tact­less pay­ment op­tions such as Ap­ple Pay or Sam­sung Pay could also be rolled out by early next year.</p>
    <p>He says: “It has be­come clear over the past few months that the cof­fee-shop and hawker scene is im­por­tant to Sin­ga­pore. You can not have cakes, but you can’t miss din­ner.</p>
    <p>“I be­lieve the night­mare is over, un­less we go into another cir­cuit breaker. De­liv­ery worked well for us and we emerged stronger.”</p>
    <p>Tak­agi Ra­men Info:</p>
    <p>which spe­cialises in spir­ulina prod­ucts – and SeedFuel, which of­fers prod­ucts made with dis­carded waste from the fruit-pro­cess­ing in­dus­try.</p>
    <p>The Jakarta branch of Three Buns and In­done­sian restau­rant Kaum, which is also part of the Potato Head group, re­opened last month to cater to take­away and de­liv­ery or­ders af­ter clos­ing on April 1.</p>
    <p>Chef Pen­ney says: “Sim­i­lar to our op­er­a­tions in Sin­ga­pore, we con­tinue to be flex­i­ble to the chang­ing en­vi­ron­ment in Jakarta as the coun­try tran­si­tions through the phases of re­open­ing. De­liv­ery and take­away or­ders play an im­por­tant role in our op­er­a­tions and sales.” tak­a­gi­ra­men.com</p>
    <p>The surge in de­mand for food de­liv­ery has be­come the main life­line for ca­sual ra­men chain</p>
    <p>Tak­agi Ra­men.</p>
    <p>Since the cir­cuit breaker pe­riod started on April 7, the five-year-old brand saw a 200 per cent in­crease in de­liv­ery or­ders – across food de­liv­ery plat­forms De­liv­eroo, Food­panda, GrabFood and Od­dle – com­pared with pre­vi­ous months.</p>
    <p>That has been a re­lief for the chain’s op­er­a­tions man­ager Joven Tok, 27, who says the chain was al­ready ex­pect­ing a 20 to 30 per cent drop in rev­enue in March.</p>
    <p>In April, it saw a 600 per cent jump in new cus­tomers on De­liv­eroo, com­pared with pre­vi­ous months. Or­ders also tripled on the food de­liv­ery plat­form.</p>
    <p>Tak­agi Ra­men has four out­lets, in Pasir Ris, Ang Mo Kio and Jurong West and the Na­tional Univer­sity of Sin­ga­pore. The NUS out­let is cur­rently closed, but is likely to re­open soon.</p>
    <p>The chain has adapted to the sit­u­a­tion and min­imised busi­ness dis­rup­tion through mea­sures such as man­ag­ing man­power ef­fec­tively.</p>
    <p>For ex­am­ple, ser­vice staff were re­de­ployed to man­age the call cen­tre, set up two months ago to man­age de­liv­ery, while dish­wash­ers took on safe-dis­tanc­ing roles.</p>
    <p>Mr Tok says: “It’s all about adapt­ing ef­fi­ciently and re­train­ing staff where we have to.”</p>
    <p>With the surge in de­mand for de­liv­ery and take­away, he was quick to stock up on take­away boxes and food in­gre­di­ents in case of dis­rup­tion to sup­plies.</p>
    <p>Rid­ing on the bub­ble tea craze dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker pe­riod – when stores sell­ing the pop­u­lar bev­er­age were not al­lowed to open – Tak­agi Ra­men worked with lo­cal start-up FrothTea to sell its drinks via de­liv­ery. The bev­er­ages are still sold at the eater­ies.</p>
    <p>And the busi­ness is ex­pand­ing. A fifth Tak­agi Ra­men out­let in</p>
    <p>While many food and bev­er­age busi­nesses are strug­gling to stay afloat in the Covid-19 pan­demic, some have been quick to change course</p>
    <p>Dy­lan Tan, 27, Face­book Live host Info:</p>
    <p>face­book.com/ sin­ga­pore­home­cooks</p>
    <p>Five min­utes is all Mr Dy­lan Tan takes to sell 700 live lob­sters,</p>
    <p>1,600 brioche buns, 1,200 blocks of French but­ter and 800 do-it-your­self chilli crab sets – and all via Face­book.</p>
    <p>The for­mer cur­tain sales­man hosts live ses­sions on Face­book group Sin­ga­pore Home Cooks (SHC), a com­mu­nity of cook­ing en­thu­si­asts with more than</p>
    <p>58,000 fol­low­ers.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing one ses­sion last month, he ped­dled more than 5,400kg of duri­ans in about two hours.</p>
    <p>He says: “At a shop, you are sell­ing prod­ucts to one per­son or a few peo­ple. On Face­book Live, you could be sell­ing to 1,000 peo­ple.</p>
    <p>You could sell 800 tubs of yo­gurt in five min­utes. How do you do that in a phys­i­cal store?”</p>
    <p>The savvy sales­man honed his skills for the past few years at mc.2, a cur­tains and blinds sup­plier, where he still re­tains a mar­ket­ing role.</p>
    <p>When shops had to shut dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker pe­riod, a Face­book Live host­ing gig with SHC be­came a new rev­enue stream.</p>
    <p>He was pre­vi­ously work­ing be­hind the scenes shoot­ing video con­tent for the group, but is now its main “aun­tie-killer” face, whom mem­bers see al­most daily.</p>
    <p>Views of the live-stream ses­sions have surged to more than 10,000 in the past few months.</p>
    <p>When Mr Tan started with weekly ses­sions in March, he got only about 200 views.</p>
    <p>Un­like other busi­nesses that also sell food via Face­book Live, Mr Tan adds value through cook­ing de­mon­stra­tions with chefs and themed nights such as Ja­pan or Korea nights fea­tur­ing pro­duce used in the coun­try’s cui­sine.</p>
    <p>Wood­lands is slated to open in Oc­to­ber.</p>
    <p>On the cur­rent state of the food and bev­er­age scene, Mr Tok adds: “It is very sad to see eater­ies clos­ing. Not ev­ery­one is able to adapt quickly and we were able to</p>
    <p>Fol­low Straits Times Food on Face­book and In­sta­gram @strait­stimes­food</p>
    <p>Call­ing him­self a “per­sonal shop­per”, he sources for pre­mium in­gre­di­ents di­rectly from sup­pli­ers – usu­ally in bulk – to keep prices rea­son­able.</p>
    <p>It can take up to two weeks to pre­pare for one Face­book Live ses­sion and, af­ter the show is over, Mr Tan and his team of­ten face sleep­less nights man­ag­ing or­ders and en­sur­ing de­liv­er­ies go out promptly.</p>
    <p>He does not just sell food. Dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker pe­riod, he also sold freez­ers due to cus­tomer de­mand.</p>
    <p>He says: “I don’t sell eggs you can get from the su­per­mar­ket. I look for mid-priced to high-end prod­ucts such as uni (sea urchin), ikura (sal­mon roe) and Ja­panese wagyu. Peo­ple are still will­ing to spend on cel­e­bra­tions or to share good deals with friends and fam­ily.”</p>
    <p>Rid­ing on this on-trend sales av­enue, Mr Tan, who also runs his own dig­i­tal mar­ket­ing com­pany, is look­ing at of­fer­ing classes on util­is­ing Face­book Live.</p>
    <p>Sales and view­er­ship have dipped since phys­i­cal re­tail re­opened in phase two, but Mr Tan be­lieves that con­sumers have got used to this method of on­line shop­ping.</p>
    <p>He adds: “It is a grow­ing trend in Sin­ga­pore. Peo­ple see it as a form of en­ter­tain­ment and are open to it as a new way to shop. If not for the cir­cuit breaker, this sales method wouldn’t have caught on so quickly.”</p>
    <p>But that does not mean it works for all prod­ucts. It would, for in­stance, be tough to sell cur­tains on­line.</p>
    <p>Mr Tan chuck­les and says: “I con­sid­ered it, but ev­ery­one has dif­fer­ent win­dow mea­sure­ments and peo­ple need to feel the fab­ric. Face­book Live can work for clothes, food and even make-up, but cus­tomis­ing 800 cur­tain or­ders would be very tricky.” sur­vive be­cause we were al­ready on de­liv­ery plat­forms.</p>
    <p>“We didn’t have to worry about get­ting used to how it works. As peo­ple get used to food de­liv­ery, it also works as a form of mar­ket­ing and vis­i­bil­ity for the brand.”</p>
