    <p>Fewer than half of house­holds here have switched to an elec­tric­ity re­tailer since the lib­er­al­i­sa­tion of the en­ergy mar­ket two years ago.</p>
    <p>The En­ergy Mar­ket Author­ity (EMA) said many of the is­land’s 1.4 mil­lion house­holds are still pur­chas­ing elec­tric­ity from SP Group.</p>
    <p>This was the only sup­plier in Sin­ga­pore prior to the launch of the Open Elec­tric­ity Mar­ket (OEM) in Novem­ber 2018.</p>
    <p>In the first year of the scheme, 40 per cent of house­holds switched to OEM re­tail­ers.</p>
    <p>This rose marginally by an­other 8 per­cent­age points by the end of last month.</p>
    <p>The OEM was set up to pro­vide house­holds with a choice of en­ergy re­tail­ers. There are now 12 OEM sup­pli­ers in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>Kep­pel Elec­tric has the largest mar­ket share at 23.4 per cent, fol­lowed by Geneco with 21 per cent.</p>
    <p>In a sur­vey of more than 7,000 house­holds con­ducted by the EMA be­tween last Novem­ber and June this year, nine in 10 in­di­cated that they were sat­is­fied with the ser­vice pro­vided by their OEM sup­plier.</p>
    <p>Di­a­mond En­ergy Mer­chants ranked the high­est in terms of over­all sat­is­fac­tion while Kep­pel Elec­tric ranked the low­est.</p>
    <p>Re­tailer rat­ings are up­dated on the OEM web­site ev­ery six</p>
    <p>months. Half of the sur­vey re­spon­dents who had re­newed their con­tracts did not check the price plans and rat­ings of other OEM re­tail­ers be­fore do­ing so, de­spite 53 per cent of them at­tribut­ing their de­ci­sion to “at­trac­tive price plans”.</p>
    <p>EMA chief ex­ec­u­tive Ngiam Shih Chun said cus­tomers should visit the web­site to com­pare the stan­dard price plans from all OEM re­tail­ers.</p>
    <p>Since the launch of the OEM, most con­sumers who switched to elec­tric­ity re­tail­ers would have signed two-year con­tracts.</p>
    <p>Many would have started re­ceiv­ing no­ti­fi­ca­tion about sub­se­quent sup­ply ar­range­ments after their cur­rent con­tracts end. The EMA said con­sumers should look out for these no­ti­fi­ca­tions.</p>
