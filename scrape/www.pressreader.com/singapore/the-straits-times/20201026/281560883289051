    <p>Home-grown singer Ste­fanie Sun (be­low) marked her 20th an­niver­sary in the mu­sic in­dus­try with a sec­ond on­line gig, af­ter an ear­lier one in June. On­line Mu­sic Show­case 2.0 was streamed live on plat­forms such as YouTube and QQ Mu­sic last Satur­day. An es­ti­mated au­di­ence of about 15 mil­lion watched the in­ti­mate gig live on the var­i­ous Chi­nese plat­forms.</p>
    <p>Home-grown singer Ste­fanie Sun cel­e­brates her 20th an­niver­sary in the mu­sic in­dus­try this year. While plans for a con­cert tour have been scup­pered by the coro­n­avirus pan­demic, she has been mark­ing the oc­ca­sion with on­line gigs.</p>
    <p>On June 9, she held a live-stream per­for­mance to mark the re­lease of her de­but al­bum Yan Zi on June 9, 2000.</p>
    <p>She fol­lowed up with On­line Mu­sic Show­case 2.0, which was streamed live on plat­forms such as YouTube and QQ Mu­sic last Satur­day.</p>
    <p>Dressed in a sim­ple get-up of T-shirt and jeans and backed by a full band, the singer per­formed eight tracks at Pasir Pan­jang Power Sta­tion.</p>
    <p>She kicked things off with Mag­i­cal, taken from her 2003 al­bum To Be Con­tin­ued..., which in­cor­po­rated the use of tra­di­tional In­dian mu­si­cal in­stru­ments such as the tabla and sitar.</p>
    <p>Sun, 42, also sang A Danc­ing Van Gogh, the ti­tle track of her 2017 record. There was a sur­prise in store as her out­fit went from white to black in a themed tran­si­tion from “day” to “night”.</p>
    <p>The singer cov­ered sev­eral songs by oth­ers, in­clud­ing Tai­wanese band May­day’s Min­nan hit Peter & Mary as well as Welsh rock band Cata­to­nia’s Dead From The Waist Down.</p>
    <p>The on­line show ended with The Pur­suit Of Con­tent­ment. The Chi­nese ti­tle Ping Ri Kuai Le, which means Ev­ery­day Hap­pi­ness, was Sun’s wish for her fans.</p>
    <p>An es­ti­mated au­di­ence of about 15 mil­lion watched the in­ti­mate gig live on the var­i­ous Chi­nese plat­forms.</p>
    <p>It was an­nounced ear­lier that Sun will be one of the head­lin­ers for the Sin­ga­pore edi­tion of One Love Asia Fes­ti­val. The mu­sic and life­style fes­ti­val has been resched­uled to Oct 16 and 17 next year at Bayfront Event Space.</p>
