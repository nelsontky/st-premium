    <p>WASH­ING­TON • Ms MacKen­zie Scott, for­mer wife of Ama­zon’s bil­lion­aire chief ex­ec­u­tive Jeff Be­zos, has do­nated US$1.7 bil­lion (S$2.3 bil­lion) of her wealth in the past year to causes such as racial equal­ity, LGBTQ (les­bian, gay, bi­sex­ual, trans­gen­der and queer) rights, pub­lic health and cli­mate change, she said in a blog post on Tues­day.</p>
    <p>Ms Scott, who was pre­vi­ously known as MacKen­zie Be­zos, also an­nounced her new last name, which she said was taken from her mid­dle name.</p>
    <p>Last year, she signed The Giv­ing</p>
    <p>Pledge in a com­mit­ment to do­nate the ma­jor­ity of her for­tune, af­ter her split from Mr Be­zos – the world’s rich­est man – left her with a 4 per cent stake in Ama­zon.</p>
    <p>“Like many, I watched the first half of 2020 with a mix­ture of heart­break and hor­ror,” she wrote in a post on the Medium web­site.</p>
    <p>“I be­gan work to com­plete my pledge with the be­lief that my life had yielded two as­sets that could be of par­tic­u­lar value to oth­ers: the money these sys­tems helped de­liver to me, and a con­vic­tion that peo­ple who have ex­pe­ri­ence with in­equities are the ones best equipped to de­sign so­lu­tions.”</p>
    <p>At the time of the di­vorce, her stake was worth about US$36 bil­lion.</p>
    <p>Her for­tune has grown to over US$60 bil­lion fol­low­ing a jump in Ama­zon’s shares this year.</p>
    <p>Ms Scott made her an­nounce­ment a day be­fore Mr Be­zos will ap­pear for his first con­gres­sional tes­ti­mony in front of an an­titrust panel, which has been in­ves­ti­gat­ing how Ama­zon has used its mar­ket power to hurt smaller ri­vals.</p>
