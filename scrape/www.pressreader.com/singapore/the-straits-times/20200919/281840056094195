    <p>ATAL ROHTANG TUN­NEL (In­dia) • A tun­nel near­ing com­ple­tion in the In­dian Hi­malayas will slash by hours the time it takes troops to reach the Chi­nese bor­der, part of an in­fra­struc­ture blitz by New Delhi that has gath­ered pace since a bloody bor­der clash.</p>
    <p>The nu­clear-armed Asian gi­ants blame each other for a bru­tal high­alti­tude bat­tle in June that left 20 In­dian sol­diers dead and an un­spec­i­fied num­ber of Chi­nese ca­su­al­ties.</p>
    <p>Both sides have sent mas­sive troop re­in­force­ments, but In­dia has also stepped up its ac­tiv­i­ties be­hind the front lines – be­lat­edly so, an­a­lysts say. Its stepped-up in­fra­struc­ture pro­gramme in­cludes roads and bridges as well as high-alti­tude he­li­pads and airstrips for civil­ian and military air­craft.</p>
    <p>The show­piece is a US$400 mil­lion (S$543.4 mil­lion) tun­nel in</p>
    <p>Hi­machal Pradesh state, pro­vid­ing an all-weather route for military con­voys to avoid a 50km trudge through moun­tain passes that are snow­bound in win­ter and sub­ject to fre­quent land­slides.</p>
    <p>From late this month, what used to be a four-hour, wind­ing, high-alti­tude cross­ing will be cut to a 10-minute dash through the moun­tains in the state-of-the-art tun­nel.</p>
    <p>“There have been times on the pass route when ve­hi­cles have bro­ken down, caus­ing traf­fic jams of even six to eight hours,” said Lieu­tenant-Gen­eral Harpal Singh, head of In­dia’s Bor­der Roads Or­gan­i­sa­tion (BRO).</p>
    <p>“This tun­nel and the other in­fra­struc­ture plans change a lot for the troops,” he told Agence FrancePres­se.</p>
    <p>Labour­ers are work­ing over­time to get the tun­nel ready be­fore</p>
    <p>Prime Min­is­ter Naren­dra Modi is due to open it later this month.</p>
    <p>Cur­rently, es­sen­tial items such as arms, am­mu­ni­tion and food have to be trans­ported up in bulk be­fore win­ter starts in an area where tem­per­a­tures can plunge to mi­nus 40 deg C.</p>
    <p>Con­structed at an alti­tude of more than 3,000m and stretch­ing 9km, the Atal Rohtang Tun­nel is also a feat of en­gi­neer­ing a decade in the mak­ing – freez­ing win­ter tem­per­a­tures meant work could be done only from April to Septem­ber.</p>
    <p>BRO says it has built more strate­gic roads – most in the high-ten­sion zone next to China – in the last four years than in the pre­vi­ous decade and aims to com­plete 15 more key routes by the end of next year.</p>
    <p>Labour­ers are up­grad­ing a re­cently com­pleted 250km stretch par­al­lel to the Chi­nese fron­tier that cuts jour­ney times from Ladakh’s cap­i­tal Leh from one week to less than a day. Sig­nif­i­cantly, by next month, all bridges along the route will be able to sup­port the weight of a 70-tonne T-90 tank on a trailer, or a truck car­ry­ing a sur­face-to-air mis­sile, ac­cord­ing to press re­ports.</p>
    <p>There are sev­eral strate­gic high­alti­tude tun­nels as well as 125 bridges at dif­fer­ent stages of plan­ning in the states of Ladakh, Arunachal Pradesh, Hi­machal Pradesh and Sikkim bor­der­ing Ti­bet and Xin­jiang.</p>
    <p>Be­sides the strate­gic value, the im­prove­ments will also be life-chang­ing for peo­ple who can be cut off from the rest of In­dia for months in win­ter. This will boost the lo­cal econ­omy and at­tract more peo­ple to the sparsely pop­u­lated area, and so make it less prone to cross-bor­der in­cur­sions by the Chi­nese, the gov­ern­ment hopes.</p>
