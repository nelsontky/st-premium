    <p>Fire­brand In­done­sian cleric Rizieq Shi­hab has apol­o­gised over re­cent mass gath­er­ings in Jakarta which flouted health mea­sures to con­trol the coro­n­avirus and sparked fears of fresh out­breaks in the cap­i­tal.</p>
    <p>His apol­ogy came amid un­cer­tainty over whether he has tested pos­i­tive for Covid-19.</p>
    <p>The leader of vig­i­lante group Is­lamic De­fend­ers Front, or FPI, was mobbed by thou­sands of sup­port­ers at the air­port when he re­turned from self-ex­ile in Saudi Ara­bia on Nov 10.</p>
    <p>That same week, he also drew mask-less crowds to cel­e­brate his daugh­ter’s wed­ding and com­mem­o­rate Prophet Muham­mad’s birth­day.</p>
    <p>He told a vir­tual fo­rum of cler­ics yes­ter­day that he had can­celled plans for fu­ture gath­er­ings and trips to the dis­tricts un­til the pan­demic is over, adding: “I apol­o­gise that there was a build-up of peo­ple which went out of con­trol... the fol­low­ers were too en­thu­si­as­tic.”</p>
    <p>His re­marks came a day af­ter he failed to show up at a po­lice sta­tion for in­ter­ro­ga­tion on the gath­er­ings.</p>
    <p>Po­lice have is­sued a sec­ond sum­mons for him to re­port to­day, af­ter which they could de­tain him.</p>
    <p>Mr Rizieq was first due to ex­plain to the po­lice on Tues­day about the Nov 14 mass event in Jakarta, when thou­sands of his sup­port­ers gath­ered to at­tend the wed­ding and mark the Prophet’s birth­day.</p>
    <p>He in­stead sent 38 lawyers to the Jakarta po­lice sta­tion and one of them, Mr Aziz Yan­uar, told re­porters that this was enough to ful­fil the po­lice sum­mons. He told the po­lice that Mr Rizieq needed rest as he had just been dis­charged from hospi­tal.</p>
    <p>No doc­tor’s af­fi­davit on Mr Rizieq’s health was given to the po­lice, a re­quire­ment for us­ing a health rea­son for not ful­fill­ing a sum­mons.</p>
    <p>Mr Rizieq was hos­pi­talised at Ummi hospi­tal in Bo­gor be­tween Nov 25 and Satur­day for ex­haus­tion and took a swab test, but the re­sult has not been re­ported to the Covid-19 task force, the agency that would have to carry out con­tact trac­ing if it is pos­i­tive.</p>
    <p>The task force has filed a po­lice com­plaint against the hospi­tal, which the gov­ern­ment ac­cused of not be­ing co­op­er­a­tive when the task force wanted to ad­min­is­ter a sep­a­rate swab test on Mr Rizieq.</p>
