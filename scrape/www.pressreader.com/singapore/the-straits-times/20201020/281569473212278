    <p>The chief of Umno Youth has called for a po­lit­i­cal cease­fire as the grow­ing num­ber of Covid-19 cases in Malaysia in­creas­ingly af­fects the pop­u­la­tion and their liveli­hoods. Datuk Asyraf Wa­jdi Dusuki im­plored politi­cians to fo­cus on na­tional rec­on­cil­i­a­tion in­stead.</p>
    <p>PETALING JAYA • The chief of Umno Youth has called for a po­lit­i­cal cease­fire amid a resur­gence in Covid-19 cases in Malaysia, and for politi­cians to fo­cus in­stead on na­tional rec­on­cil­i­a­tion.</p>
    <p>The wing’s head, Datuk Asyraf Wa­jdi Dusuki, said the cur­rent Covid-19 sit­u­a­tion is trou­bling as cases have con­tin­ued to spike while the econ­omy is shrink­ing, and this has af­fected the livelihood of the peo­ple.</p>
    <p>“Don’t let us be pun­ished by the peo­ple who are sick and tired of the at­ti­tude of politi­cians who con­tinue to fight over po­lit­i­cal i ssues of power end­lessly,” Mr Asyraf said.</p>
    <p>“It’s the right time for politi­cians, de­spite their po­lit­i­cal par­ties, to hold a po­lit­i­cal cease­fire in or­der to think of the best so­lu­tions for the wel­fare of the peo­ple,” he said in a Face­book post yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>“Maybe this is the best time for all par­ties to set aside their dif­fer­ences and give fo­cus to a Na­tional Rec­on­cil­i­a­tion agenda.” He did not say what he meant by the rec­on­cil­i­a­tion agenda.</p>
    <p>He made the call amid a jock­ey­ing for posts in the seven-month-old rul­ing Perikatan Na­sional (PN) al­liance led by Prime Min­is­ter Muhyid­din Yassin.</p>
    <p>Umno lead­ers are push­ing for new terms to re­main in PN, and have threat­ened the col­lapse of the gov­ern­ment if Tan Sri Muhyid­din fails to meet these de­mands.</p>
    <p>A se­nior Umno leader said the party wants the deputy prime min­is­ter’s post and other key Cabi­net po­si­tions.</p>
    <p>Its call was made fol­low­ing op­po­si­tion chief An­war Ibrahim’s au­di­ence with the King last week, at which he claimed to have a “for­mi­da­ble” ma­jor­ity of MPs be­hind him to form a new gov­ern­ment and be­come the new prime min­is­ter.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, a se­nior Umno leader and a Cabi­net min­is­ter i n the Muhyid­din ad­min­is­tra­tion said Malaysia should hold a gen­eral elec­tion, and pick a new prime min­is­ter, only after over­com­ing the coro­n­avirus pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Umno Supreme Coun­cil mem­ber An­nuar Musa said in a tweet yes­ter­day: “No need to think of a re­place­ment for now... We are in con­sen­sus, help the gov­ern­ment. When Covid-19 eases, im­me­di­ately dis­solve Par­lia­ment and leave it to the pub­lic... Give chance for PM to save the coun­try and pub­lic lives first.”</p>
    <p>He was re­spond­ing to news re­ports that the po­lit­i­cal party of former prime min­is­ter Ma­hathir Mo­hamad, Pe­juang, has nom­i­nated the 95-year-old states­man as the can­di­date to re­place Mr Muhyid­din.</p>
    <p>Umno, its ally Parti Is­lam SeMalaysia and Mr Muhyid­din’s own Parti Pribumi Ber­satu Malaysia were set to meet yes­ter­day evening to dis­cuss their co­op­er­a­tion un­der the Muafakat Na­sional pact.</p>
    <p>Umno has, mean­while, post­poned a meet­ing to­day of the Supreme Coun­cil, its high­est de­ci­sion-mak­ing body, where it was to dis­cuss its con­tin­ued co­op­er­a­tion with PN.</p>
    <p>Mr Asyraf said “Na­tional Rec­on­cil­i­a­tion” does not mean that each party has to dis­re­gard its po­lit­i­cal iden­tity or its own party strug­gles.</p>
    <p>“In­stead, the Na­tional Rec­on­cil­i­a­tion will al­low po­lit­i­cal par­ties to tem­po­rar­ily sus­pend any dis­pute in terms of a power strug­gle,” he said.</p>
    <p>Malaysia logged 867 Covid-19 in­fec­tions yes­ter­day, the third day in a row of 800-plus cases in a 24-hour pe­riod.</p>
    <p>It’s the right time for politi­cians, de­spite their po­lit­i­cal par­ties, to hold a po­lit­i­cal cease­fire in or­der to think of the best so­lu­tions for the wel­fare of the peo­ple. Maybe this is the best time for all par­ties to set aside their dif­fer­ences and give fo­cus to a Na­tional Rec­on­cil­i­a­tion agenda.</p>
