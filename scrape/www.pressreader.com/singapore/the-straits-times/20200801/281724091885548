    <p>The four new coro­n­avirus cases at Bukit Pan­jang In­te­grated Trans­port Hub are two bus driv­ers and two in­ter­change staff, said SMRT yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Tests showed that they were likely to have had past in­fec­tions and are no longer in­fec­tious. How­ever, all four are in iso­la­tion while await­ing Min­istry of Health (MOH) in­struc­tions.</p>
    <p>They were last at work on Tues­day or Wed­nes­day, said SMRT’s chief com­mu­ni­ca­tions of­fi­cer Mar­garet Teo. The two driv­ers drove ser­vice 972.</p>
    <p>Ms Teo added that both can­teens in the trans­port hub were closed for dis­in­fec­tion and have since re­opened.</p>
    <p>“The premises and ve­hi­cles that our af­fected em­ploy­ees had been in con­tact with have been thor­oughly cleaned and dis­in­fected,” she said. “We have also started the con­tact trac­ing process with MOH. Em­ploy­ees who were in close con­tact with them have been placed on leave of ab­sence in col­lab­o­ra­tion with MOH.”</p>
    <p>There are now eight cases linked to the clus­ter at the trans­port hub, which The Straits Times un­der­stands to be the first Covid-19 clus­ter to have emerged since the cir­cuit breaker ended.</p>
    <p>In late June, a “fam­ily clus­ter” was iden­ti­fied in Tampines Street 11. MOH sub­se­quently car­ried out test­ing for peo­ple who live in or had vis­ited the af­fected block. How­ever, the block was never for­mally iden­ti­fied as a clus­ter.</p>
    <p>In Bukit Pan­jang, it seemed to be busi­ness as usual when The Straits Times vis­ited the af­fected area yes­ter­day. Al­though some of the af­fected eater­ies saw lit­tle foot­fall, other stores – such as FairPrice – saw a steady stream of cus­tomers.</p>
    <p>Sev­eral shops at Hil­lion Mall, which is linked to the trans­port hub, have been added to the list of places vis­ited by in­fec­tious coro­n­avirus pa­tients. These in­clude FairPrice, Wat­sons, the My Briyani House eatery, Mr Teh Tarik deli and McDonald’s.</p>
    <p>A to­tal of 396 new coro­n­avirus cases were con­firmed yes­ter­day, the ma­jor­ity of which were work per­mit hold­ers re­sid­ing in for­eign worker dor­mi­to­ries.</p>
    <p>There were three cases in the wider com­mu­nity.</p>
    <p>There were also three im­ported cases who were placed on stay­home no­tices upon their ar­rival in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
