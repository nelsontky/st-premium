    <p>There had not been a pub­lic piano recital in Sin­ga­pore since Feb 14, when South Korean pian­ist Kun-woo Paik took to the stage of Vic­to­ria Con­cert Hall.</p>
    <p>Even the an­nual Sin­ga­pore In­ter­na­tional Piano Fes­ti­val had to be de­ferred.</p>
    <p>Thus, it seemed like po­etic jus­tice that the fes­ti­val’s artis­tic di­rec­tor, Lim Yan, be­came the first pian­ist to per­form a live recital since the lift­ing of the cir­cuit breaker pe­riod.</p>
    <p>In front of a so­cially dis­tanced and masked au­di­ence of 50, he of­fered a sparkling pro­gramme of mostly short pieces.</p>
    <p>The sin­gle-move­ment sonatas of Domenico Scar­latti made for per­fect starters and Lim chose three less fa­mil­iar num­bers, all in the key of D ma­jor.</p>
    <p>It takes an imag­i­na­tive artist to lend t hem fresh­ness, and he suc­ceeded by vary­ing tonal colour, tex­tures and mood.</p>
    <p>The pieces were orig­i­nally con­ceived for harp­si­chord, but Lim trans­lated their feather-light bril­liance well into more sus­tained sonor­ity for the piano.</p>
    <p>His prodi­gious re­peated-note tech­nique in the faster num­bers sim­u­lated the gui­tar and cas­tanets, while rapidly shift­ing chords evoked the peal­ing of bells.</p>
    <p>Between two Scar­lat­tis, Lim sneaked in the three move­ments of Haydn’s Sonata No. 37 in D ma­jor. The baroque era merged al­most im­per­cep­ti­bly into the clas­si­cal age, as the Aus­trian mas­ter’s ex­u­ber­ant open­ing fan­fares and grace notes re­called an ear­lier epoch.</p>
    <p>Light-hearted chat­ter and un­ceas­ing wit ruled, with only a more som­bre slow move­ment pro­vid­ing con­trast.</p>
    <p>There was no in­ter­mis­sion for the recital. In its place was an en­gag­ing show-and-tell ses­sion hosted by vi­o­lin­ist Yang Shux­i­ang, which neatly linked the recital’s three com­posers.</p>
    <p>The recital con­cluded with Rach­mani­nov’s later Op. 32 set of Pre­ludes. Lim as­tutely pref­aced this with the Rus­sian’s early and in­fa­mous C sharp mi­nor Pre­lude (Op. 3 No. 2), some­times called the Bells Of Moscow, the wis­dom of which would be later re­vealed.</p>
    <p>What fol­lowed was a kalei­do­scopic show of the piano’s myr­iad pos­si­bil­i­ties in some of the reper­toire’s most tech­ni­cally chal­leng­ing pieces.</p>
    <p>Lim’s grasp of the id­iom was fault­less, con­quer­ing thorny minia­ture mas­ter­pieces with al­most non­cha­lant aplomb, while al­ways at­tuned to un­der­cur­rents of Slavic brood­ing and melan­choly.</p>
    <p>A ref­er­ence to ear­lier pieces came i n the skit­tish A mi­nor Pre­lude (No. 8), its fleet-fin­gered fig­u­ra­tions and cross­ing of hands rem­i­nis­cent of Scar­latti.</p>
    <p>The two pre­ludes bet­ter known to ca­sual lis­ten­ers, in G ma­jor and G sharp mi­nor (Nos. 5 and 12),were han­dled with love and care, their limpid lyri­cism shin­ing through.</p>
    <p>The set reached a cli­max in the B mi­nor Pre­lude (No. 10), with im­pas­sioned pas­sages of chim­ing car­il­lons which also char­ac­terised No. 13. The vale­dic­tory No. 13 com­pleted a full cir­cle which be­gan with C sharp mi­nor and closed in D flat ma­jor, both en­har­monic re­lated keys.</p>
    <p>These con­sid­er­a­tions are why a well-planned pro­gramme of mu­sic sounds so pleas­ing – and har­mo­nious – to our ears.</p>
