    <p>• WeWork is sell­ing a ma­jor­ity stake in its China busi­ness as the co-work­ing gi­ant con­tin­ues to pare down its ex­penses, the com­pany said on Wed­nes­day.</p>
    <p>Trust­bridge Part­ners, an ex­ist­ing in­vestor in WeWork’s China sub­sidiary, has in­vested an ad­di­tional US$200 mil­lion (S$275.3 mil­lion) and now owns more than half of the busi­ness, WeWork said.</p>
    <p>WeWork par­ent com­pany We Co is giv­ing up op­er­at­ing con­trol of the unit, but will con­tinue to re­ceive an an­nual ser­vice fee in ex­change for the use of the WeWork brand and ser­vices, it added.</p>
    <p>WeWork opened its first Chi­nese lo­ca­tion in Shang­hai in 2016, and now op­er­ates more than 100 lo­ca­tions in 12 cities.</p>
    <p>Trust­bridge op­er­at­ing part­ner Michael Jiang has been ap­pointed the act­ing chief ex­ec­u­tive of WeWork China, the com­pany said.</p>
    <p>For years, WeWork had eyed Asia as a source of sig­nif­i­cant growth.</p>
    <p>The com­pany had cre­ated joint ven­tures to grow its busi­ness in Ja­pan, South Korea and China, and the China arm had raised US$1 bil­lion di­rectly from i nvestors such as SoftBank Group, Hony Cap­i­tal and Te­masek.</p>
    <p>WeWork also sued a Chi­nese ri­val, UrWork, over a too-sim­i­lar name, and spent hundreds of mil­lions ac­quir­ing other re­gional cowork­ing com­pa­nies such as Naked Hub in China and Space­mob in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>But, af­ter WeWork’s failed at­tempt at an ini­tial public of­fer­ing a year ago, the New York-based com­pany has sought ways to cut ex­penses and pare back ven­tures out­side of its core busi­ness in the United States.</p>
    <p>That in­cluded sell­ing off many of its ac­qui­si­tions and shut­ting down projects such as WeGrow, a pri­vate el­e­men­tary school.</p>
    <p>The com­pany has also tried fran­chise-like busi­ness agree­ments in the past, par­tic­u­larly for its lo­ca­tions in In­dia.</p>
