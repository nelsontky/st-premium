    <p>Strange things hap­pen when we go into hi­ber­na­tion. Left to our own de­vices, we find ways to amuse our­selves.</p>
    <p>I can­not tell you how re­ward­ing the cir­cuit breaker pe­riod was for me. I am cer­tain all in­tro­verts feel the same way.</p>
    <p>We could be an­ti­so­cial with­out any­body ask­ing un­com­fort­able ques­tions. Say no to in­vi­ta­tions be­cause, well, there were no in­vi­ta­tions. Hav­ing drinks with friends over Zoom was fun, pos­si­bly be­cause we were all in our own homes and sort of at arm’s length.</p>
    <p>This is not to say it was all smooth sail­ing.</p>
    <p>Early on, I de­vel­oped a fe­ro­cious toothache that made me un­able to con­cen­trate on any­thing ex­cept that hor­ren­dous, throb­bing pain. I called des­per­ately around. Den­tists were try­ing to fig­ure out if they could see pa­tients. I popped Ar­coxia and Tra­madol. The pain per­sisted.</p>
    <p>Fi­nally, I begged my friend, who spe­cialises in root canals, to see me be­fore I dug my teeth out with a fork.</p>
    <p>It turned out I needed two root canals. I am not the only one. We teeth grinders went into over­drive at the start of the cir­cuit breaker, when ev­ery­thing was alien and un­cer­tain.</p>
    <p>My friend then sent me to see his friend, to get the t wo teeth crowned. She in­sisted on fit­ting me with a mouth­guard.</p>
    <p>“Why hasn’t any den­tist done that?” she asked. “It’s ob­vi­ous you grind your teeth.”</p>
    <p>So, I went home with the sil­i­cone guard, snug in­side a hot-pink plas­tic case, put it on that night and slept like a baby.</p>
    <p>Yes. My 30-year prob­lem with in­som­nia van­ished.</p>
    <p>To be sure, I still wake up too early, but now, I fall asleep and stay asleep. It’s a mir­a­cle.</p>
    <p>Who knew it was brux­ism – that’s what teeth grind­ing is called – that had kept me up all those decades?</p>
    <p>I also rekin­dled my love of mak­ing bread. I had started with mak­ing cook­ies and cake, but the lure of yeast was too much to re­sist.</p>
    <p>Af­ter writ­ing a col­umn here about gar­den fo­cac­cia, my am­bi­tions rose and rose. I am still mak­ing bread, even though the world has opened up a lot more.</p>
    <p>Where I once kneaded and punched down dough to get through work angst, th­ese days, I see mak­ing bread as a way to be­come more zen and pa­tient. And to be cre­ative.</p>
    <p>I have worked through a mind­bog­gling amount of bread flour and yeast, and the obsession is not go­ing away any time soon.</p>
    <p>Right now, I am go­ing through a phase where I feel com­pelled to make bread in dif­fer­ent colours. So, I have at­tempted spinach bread, pur­ple sweet po­tato bread and pump­kin bread.</p>
    <p>On a whim, I de­cided to try mak­ing char­coal bread – jet black, shiny and a lit­tle star­tling. The ac­ti­vated char­coal pow­der I use is avail­able in stores where you can buy sup­plies in small or large amounts.</p>
    <p>Usu­ally, I am im­mune to things like Valen­tine’s Day. But I think this bread is a fun project for Hal­loween. Which is an­other “fes­ti­val” I never think to make any­thing of.</p>
    <p>I made a tray of lit­tle char­coal buns, gave most of it to one of my friends and he used it in so many cre­ative ways. He made a de­li­cious­look­ing otah and omelette sand­wich, French toast, and spread the buns with kaya and but­ter, among other things.</p>
    <p>“Th­ese buns are quite moist and I was think­ing you should put dark choco­late in them,” he texted. “Duke Bak­ery had a dark choco­late bun which I adored. Make the small buns with dark choco­late, pleaseeeee.” So I did.</p>
    <p>On my first try, I used a choppedup choco­late bar with 90 per cent co­coa, and dried tart cher­ries, which I love be­yond rea­son. When I sliced the bun in two, the choco­late had melted and the fill­ing looked like the in­side of a Black For­est cake. Yes!</p>
    <p>But I needed a lit­tle more sweet­ness. A 90 per cent bar is just too aus­tere. So, use one with no more than 70 per cent co­coa solids or a bar of good milk choco­late. If you do not like tart cher­ries, use dried cran­ber­ries or raisins in­stead. Soak the raisins in rum first, I dare you.</p>
    <p>Then, I thought about Hal­loween com­ing up and won­dered if I could make a bun with a pump­kin fill­ing. I did, but fill­ing the buns was need­lessly fid­dly.</p>
    <p>In­stead, I turned the fill­ing into a spread, like kaya. The or­ange colour con­trasts with the black bread and you ab­so­lutely should slice some cold salted but­ter to com­plete your sand­wich. Or spread one slice of bread with cream cheese and the other with the pump­kin spread and slap them to­gether.</p>
    <p>This bread dough is ver­sa­tile and quite easy to work with.</p>
    <p>I have made Pull­man loaves with it and, of course, you can shape it into 10 or 12 buns for ham­burg­ers, egg washed be­fore bak­ing and sprin­kled with white sesame seeds; or make 16 buns you can stuff with otah, lun­cheon meat, cheese, curry chicken, char siew or rasp­berry jam, sweet red bean, cus­tard or any num­ber of things.</p>
    <p>Once you start mak­ing bread, it’s dif­fi­cult to stop.</p>
    <p>You have been warned.</p>
