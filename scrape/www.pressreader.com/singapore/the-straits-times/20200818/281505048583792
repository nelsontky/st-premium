    <p>WELLING­TON • New Zealand’s Prime Min­is­ter has post­poned the coun­try’s gen­eral elec­tion by a month to Oct 17 as the city of Auck­land re­mains in lock­down due to a grow­ing coro­n­avirus out­break.</p>
    <p>Ms Jacinda Ardern bowed to pres­sure to de­lay the polls af­ter par­ties com­plained they could not cam­paign with nearly a third of New Zealand’s five mil­lion peo­ple un­der lock­down in Auck­land.</p>
    <p>“Ul­ti­mately, Oct 17... pro­vides suf­fi­cient time for par­ties to plan around the range of cir­cum­stances we will be cam­paign­ing un­der,” said Ms Ardern at a news con­fer­ence yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The Prime Min­is­ter ruled out de­lay­ing the polls any fur­ther, as her Labour Party main­tains a strong lead over the con­ser­va­tive Na­tional Party in opin­ion polls.</p>
    <p>“We are all in the same boat. We are all cam­paign­ing in the same en­vi­ron­ment,” Ms Ardern said.</p>
    <p>New Zealand yes­ter­day recorded nine new cases of Covid-19, tak­ing the num­ber of ac­tive cases to 78. There have now been a to­tal of 1,280 cases in the coun­try, and 22 deaths.</p>
    <p>An ear­lier elec­tion would have worked in Ms Ardern’s favour, as her suc­cess in sti­fling Covid-19 and keep­ing the coun­try virus-free for 102 days un­til the lat­est out­break had boosted her pop­u­lar­ity.</p>
    <p>The elec­tion was slated for Sept 19 and New Zealand law re­quires it to be held by Nov 21. Ad­vance vot­ing will now start on Oct 3.</p>
    <p>Deputy Prime Min­is­ter Win­ston Peters, who had called for a de­lay, said “com­mon sense has pre­vailed”. The leader of the pop­ulist New Zealand First party de­liv­ered govern­ment to Labour through a coali­tion deal af­ter no party won a ma­jor­ity at the 2017 elec­tion.</p>
    <p>The Elec­tion Com­mis­sion said it was ready to hold a vote with health mea­sures, in­clud­ing the use of hand sani­tiser and phys­i­cal dis­tanc­ing in vot­ing cen­tres, pro­tec­tive gear for staff and con­tact-trac­ing sys­tems.</p>
    <p>Ms Ardern’s op­po­nents ac­cuse her of us­ing the pan­demic to shore up sup­port as she ap­pears on tele­vi­sion nearly ev­ery day to re­as­sure</p>
    <p>New Zealan­ders, while other party lead­ers strug­gle to get at­ten­tion.</p>
    <p>Her ri­vals are hop­ing she will lose some of her ap­peal once eco­nomic hard­ships caused by the lock­down be­gin to bite.</p>
    <p>New Zealand has fared far bet­ter than most coun­tries dur­ing the pan­demic, but an abrupt resur­gence of Covid-19 cases last week in Auck­land prompted Ms Ardern to ex­tend a lock­down for the city’s 1.7 mil­lion res­i­dents un­til Aug 26, while so­cial dis­tanc­ing rules are in place in other towns and cities.</p>
    <p>The ori­gin of the new out­break is still un­known. The au­thor­i­ties said pre­vi­ously that it could have been through an Ameri­cold cold-storage fa­cil­ity where one of the in­fected in­di­vid­u­als worked.</p>
    <p>Tests of sur­faces in the fa­cil­ity are un­der way to iden­tify the genome se­quence. The au­thor­i­ties are also in­ves­ti­gat­ing if there is any link to an Ameri­cold fa­cil­ity in the Aus­tralian city of Mel­bourne, where Covid-19 cases have surged in re­cent weeks.</p>
    <p>An­other pos­si­ble source is the quar­an­tine sys­tem for New Zealan­ders re­turn­ing from over­seas.</p>
    <p>Na­tional Party leader Judith Collins said on Twit­ter: “Right now, the fo­cus must be on find­ing out ex­actly what failed so cat­a­stroph­i­cally at the bor­der, so we can be sure it won’t hap­pen again.”</p>
    <p>MORE TIME FOR CAM­PAIGN PLANS</p>
    <p>Ul­ti­mately, Oct 17... pro­vides suf­fi­cient time for par­ties to plan around the range of cir­cum­stances we will be cam­paign­ing un­der... We are all in the same boat. We are all cam­paign­ing in the same en­vi­ron­ment. ’’</p>
    <p>NEW ZEALAND PRIME MIN­IS­TER JACINDA ARDERN, on the new gen­eral elec­tion date.</p>
