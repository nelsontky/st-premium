    <p>ROME • Rafael Nadal has warned he knows how to fix his er­rors be­fore his French Open ti­tle de­fence af­ter crash­ing in the quar­ter-fi­nals of the Rome Masters on Satur­day, the fi­nal warm-up event be­fore Roland Gar­ros.</p>
    <p>The nine-time Rome win­ner bowed out 6-2, 7-5 on a hu­mid night in the Ital­ian cap­i­tal to Ar­gen­tinian Diego Schwartz­man, a player the sec­ond seed had beaten in all nine of their pre­vi­ous clashes.</p>
    <p>It was Nadal’s last chance to tune up be­fore his bid for a 13th French Open, and a record-equalling 20th Grand Slam to match Swiss great Roger Fed­erer in just over a week.</p>
    <p>“It’s a com­pletely spe­cial and un­pre­dictable year,” said the 34-yearold Spa­niard. “I’ll prob­a­bly go back home and then let’s see what’s go­ing on. I did my job here.</p>
    <p>“I fought un­til the end. But los­ing that many serves, you can’t ex­pect to win a match. Some­thing that I have to fix. I know how to do it.</p>
    <p>“I’m go­ing to keep work­ing and keep prac­tis­ing with the right at­ti­tude, and try to give me a chance to be ready.</p>
    <p>“I did a cou­ple of things well and other things bad. And that’s it. At least I played three matches.”</p>
    <p>The two-time de­fend­ing cham­pion was mak­ing his come­back af­ter a long coro­n­avirus-en­forced break, hav­ing skipped the US Open.</p>
    <p>Nadal beat com­pa­triot Pablo Car­reno Busta, who reached the semi­fi­nals at Flush­ing Mead­ows, 6-1, 6-1 last week fol­lowed by a 6-1, 6-3 win over Serb Du­san La­jovic.</p>
    <p>But Schwartz­man put on a stun­ning per­for­mance to leave Nadal with no an­swer.</p>
    <p>“Af­ter such a long time with­out com­pet­ing, I played good two matches, and now today, I played a bad one against a good op­po­nent,” added Nadal.</p>
    <p>Schwartz­man, with just three ca</p>
    <p>reer ti­tles to Nadal’s 85, said he had come close a few times to beat­ing the world No. 2, be­fore fi­nally pulling off the up­set.</p>
    <p>“I think four or five times, I was close enough to feel like maybe if I play my best ten­nis, I’m go­ing to have chances,” said the world No. 15. “Also, he was com­ing back to this tour­na­ment af­ter seven months, more or less, eight months.</p>
    <p>“I was think­ing, today maybe I have the chance.”</p>
    <p>In the men’s semi-fi­nals yes­ter­day, world No. 1 No­vak Djokovic beat Nor­we­gian Casper Ruud 7-5, 6-3, while in the women’s semis, world No. 2 Si­mona Halep de­feated Spain’s Gar­bine Mugu­ruza 6-3, 4-6, 6-4 to ad­vance to her third Rome fi­nal, putting the Ro­ma­nian in touch­ing dis­tance of her first ti­tle here.</p>
