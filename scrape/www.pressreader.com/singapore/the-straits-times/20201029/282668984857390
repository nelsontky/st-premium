    <p>SEOUL • South Korean heart-throb Gong Yoo is re­turn­ing to the big screen with fel­low ac­tor Park Bogum in Seobok, a film about the first hu­man clone.</p>
    <p>The sci-fi film, which is set to be re­leased in De­cem­ber, will fea­ture the bro­mance be­tween two main char­ac­ters played by Gong and Park.</p>
    <p>“The di­rec­tor told us to use Dustin Hoff­man and Tom Cruise’s re­la­tion­ship in Rain Man (1988) as our ref­er­ence. In the movie, Seobok is con­stantly cu­ri­ous, see­ing the real world for the first time, and Ki-hun be­comes a lit­tle ir­ri­tated by this,” Gong, 41, said dur­ing an on­line press con­fer­ence held on Tues­day.</p>
    <p>“These are ac­tu­ally im­por­tant emo­tional scenes (be­tween the two char­ac­ters) in our movie as well as the parts where the au­di­ences can prob­a­bly re­lax a bit. I also en­joyed film­ing these scenes (with Park).”</p>
    <p>In Seobok, Ki-hun (Gong) is a for­mer in­tel­li­gence agent, while Seobok (Park) is the first hu­man clone who pos­sesses the se­cret of eter­nal life.</p>
    <p>Ki-hun re­ceives his fi­nal mis­sion from the di­rec­tor of the in­tel­li­gence agency (played by Cho Woo-jin) to move Seo-bok, who has never known life out­side of the lab­o­ra­tory, to a safe place.</p>
    <p>Seobok is Gong’s first movie in a year af­ter his role in Kim Ji-young: Born 1982 (2019), which also starred Jung Yu-mi. Both Gong and Jung have pre­vi­ously starred in the zom­bie flick Train To Bu­san (2016).</p>
    <p>Park, 27, was ab­sent from the press con­fer­ence on Tues­day as he is cur­rently in manda­tory mil­i­tary ser­vice.</p>
    <p>Di­rec­tor Lee Yong-joo ex­plained why he chose to cre­ate two male main char­ac­ters.</p>
    <p>“When I was first writ­ing the plot, I did con­sider writ­ing Seo-bok as a fe­male char­ac­ter (like many other films that fea­ture the first hu­man clones). But then, I de­cided to make it a male char­ac­ter since it could be a cliche if Seo-bok is a woman and there’s a ro­man­tic re­la­tion­ship be­tween the two main pro­tag­o­nists,” Lee said.</p>
    <p>The film is his first since Ar­chi­tec­ture 101, a hit ro­mance that came out in 2012.</p>
    <p>The di­rec­tor added that even though Seobok uses a hu­man clone as one of its main char­ac­ters, that is not the key el­e­ment in the movie.</p>
    <p>“Hu­man clone Seo-bok came in later,” Lee said. “I did not be­gin writ­ing the script with the theme of eter­nal life or a hu­man clone in my mind. The script be­gan with my in­ten­tion to write a story about hu­man fear.”</p>
    <p>He noted that the idea to name the clone Seo-bok, which came from the leg­end of Chi­nese ex­plorer Xu Fu, came to him later. He said it rep­re­sents the fear of death and the de­sire to live eter­nally.</p>
    <p>Xu Fu, known as Seo-bok in Korea, was a Qin Dy­nasty fig­ure sent to Korea by Chi­nese Em­peror Qin Shi­huang to look for a plant known for giv­ing eter­nal life.</p>
