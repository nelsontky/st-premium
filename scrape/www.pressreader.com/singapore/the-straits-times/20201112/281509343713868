    <p>The Lornie Road park con­nec­tor, which ex­tends from MacRitchie Reser­voir carpark to</p>
    <p>Kheam Hock Park, will be com­pleted in the next few weeks. The Na­tional Parks Board said it is work­ing to com­plete the project be­fore the year end.</p>
    <p>It is the fi­nal ma­jor seg­ment of a 36km coastto-coast trail that links Coney Is­land in the east to Jurong Lake Gar­dens in the west. The project has been in the mak­ing since the Lornie High­way project was an­nounced in 2011. Lornie Road is now a dual two-lane road, with a speed limit of 50kmh.</p>
    <p>The l ong-awaited Lornie Road park con­nec­tor – stretch­ing about 2km from MacRitchie Reser­voir carpark to the fringe of Kheam Hock Park – will be com­pleted in the next few weeks.</p>
    <p>The project, which has been in the mak­ing since the Lornie High­way project was an­nounced in 2011, was last de­layed by Covid-19 cir­cuit breaker mea­sures. It was pre­vi­ously de­layed when the high­way project was held up by main con­trac­tor Swee Hong’s fi­nan­cial prob­lems.</p>
    <p>NParks said it is work­ing to com­plete the project be­fore the end of the year.</p>
    <p>Checks by The Straits Times on Mon­day re­vealed that the con­nec­tor is al­most com­pleted, with work­ers fin­ish­ing pav­ing the path with a sec­ond layer of bi­tu­men on the fi­nal 250m.</p>
    <p>Work­ers on site said the pav­ing works will be done by this week, and signs will be painted on next.</p>
    <p>The Lornie Road park con­nec­tor is the last ma­jor pur­pose-built seg­ment of a 36km coast-to-coast trail that links Coney Is­land in the east to Jurong Lake Gar­dens in the west. It runs along­side Lornie Road, which had up to four lanes each way be­fore Lornie High­way opened two years ago.</p>
    <p>Lornie Road has since been down­graded to a dual two-lane road and now has a speed limit of 50kmh (from 70kmh pre­vi­ously). Speed humps have also been put up at sev­eral lo­ca­tions, es­pe­cially the stretches near houses.</p>
    <p>Avid cy­clist K.C. Liew is among those look­ing for­ward to the open­ing of Lornie park con­nec­tor.</p>
    <p>“It will open up the cy­cling route skirt­ing MacRitchie Reser­voir to­wards Bukit Timah, Adam Road and Botanic Gar­dens,” said the 57-year-old busi­ness de­vel­op­ment man­ager.</p>
    <p>Since Septem­ber, Mr Liew has been tak­ing his Bromp­ton fold­able bi­cy­cle with him on his bus ride to work and then cy­cling back.</p>
    <p>But when the park con­nec­tor opens, he might cy­cle both ways, he said.</p>
    <p>“The Lornie park con­nec­tor re­mains the last in­com­plete stretch of my route be­tween of­fice and home.”</p>
    <p>Lornie Road res­i­dent H.E. Koh, 63, said the new park con­nec­tor is a new recre­ational amenity that is “much needed... es­pe­cially at a time like this”.</p>
    <p>He no­ticed that work on the con­nec­tor had stopped be­tween April and Au­gust. “I’m very happy it is now near com­ple­tion. NParks has done a won­der­ful job. This green­ing of Lornie Road will be good for walk­ers, jog­gers and cy­clists.”</p>
    <p>The re­tiree who jogs twice a week said he in­tends to buy a bi­cy­cle soon. “It is even safe to cy­cle on the road be­cause traf­fic is very light now.”</p>
