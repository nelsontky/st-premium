    <p>WASH­ING­TON • One per­son in the United States died about ev­ery minute from Covid-19 on Wednes­day, as the na­tional death toll sur­passed 150,000, the high­est in the world.</p>
    <p>The US recorded 1,461 new deaths that day, the high­est one­day in­crease since 1,484 on May 27, ac­cord­ing to a Reuters tally.</p>
    <p>The coun­try’s coro­n­avirus deaths are ris­ing at the fastest rate in two months and have i ncreased by 10,000 in the past 11 days.</p>
    <p>Na­tion­ally, the death toll has risen for three weeks in a row while the num­ber of new in­fec­tions week over week re­cently fell for the first time since last month.</p>
    <p>But the coun­try is still bat­tling its first wave of the coro­n­avirus, hav­ing never taken con­trol of it.</p>
    <p>The pace of in­fec­tion has ac­cel­er­ated since the death toll passed 100,000 on May 27.</p>
    <p>South­ern and west­ern states have been par­tic­u­larly hard hit.</p>
    <p>A spike in cases in Florida, Ari­zona, Cal­i­for­nia and Texas this month has over­whelmed hos­pi­tals.</p>
    <p>The rise in cases has forced states to make a U-turn on re­open­ing economies that were re­stricted by lock­downs in March and April to slow the spread of the virus.</p>
    <p>Texas l eads the na­tion with nearly 4,300 deaths so far this month, fol­lowed by Florida with 2,900 and Cal­i­for­nia, the most pop­u­lous state, with 2,700.</p>
    <p>The Texas fig­ure in­cludes a back­log of hun­dreds of deaths after the state changed the way it counted Covid-19 fa­tal­i­ties.</p>
    <p>On Wednes­day, Cal­i­for­nia, Florida and Texas re­ported record in­creases in Covid-19 deaths for a sec­ond day in a row, based on the Reuters tally.</p>
    <p>Cal­i­for­nia had 185 fa­tal­i­ties and Florida re­ported 217 new deaths. Texas had at least 311 deaths.</p>
    <p>Only two other states, New York and New Jersey, have ever re­ported more than 300 deaths in a sin­gle day.</p>
    <p>While the epi­cen­tre has moved to the south and the west, the area around New York still has by far the high­est toll for one state at more than 32,000 deaths.</p>
    <p>Coro­n­avirus deaths are ris­ing in 27 states, up from 23 states a week ago, ac­cord­ing to a Reuters anal­y­sis of deaths the past two weeks, com­pared with the prior two weeks.</p>
    <p>The ris­ing num­bers have crushed early hopes that the US was past the worst of an eco­nomic cri­sis that has dec­i­mated busi­nesses and put mil­lions of Amer­i­cans out of work.</p>
    <p>The US is the worst hit in the world, with more than 4.5 mil­lion in­fec­tions and over 153,000 deaths yes­ter­day, ac­cord­ing to data gath­er­ing firm Worl­dome­ter.</p>
    <p>Health ex­perts have been say­ing for months that the US out­break could be brought un­der con­trol if guide­lines to main­tain so­cial dis­tanc­ing and wear masks in pub­lic were fol­lowed ev­ery­where.</p>
    <p>Such mea­sures be­came a hot par­ti­san is­sue after Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump, who ini­tially played down the se­ri­ous­ness of the health cri­sis after the first US case in Jan­uary, re­fused to wear a mask.</p>
    <p>He has since come around to sup­port the wear­ing of masks but still has not im­posed a na­tional man­date re­quir­ing them.</p>
    <p>Florida com­mer­cial pi­lot Rob Kore­man, 50, of Fort Laud­erdale, said he had been stunned by the climb­ing num­bers in his state.</p>
    <p>“None of this should have hap­pened. We needed state co­or­di­na­tion, if not flat-out a fed­eral man­date.”</p>
    <p>Repub­li­can law­maker Louie Gohmert from Texas, who had re­fused to wear a mask, tested pos­i­tive for Covid-19 on Wednes­day, rais­ing con­cerns that other mem­bers of Congress may also have been ex­posed.</p>
    <p>With the sched­uled re­open­ing of schools j ust days away in some states, the Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion is push­ing for stu­dents to re­turn to class­rooms, while some teach­ers and lo­cal of­fi­cials have called for learn­ing to re­main on­line.</p>
    <p>The Univer­sity of Wash­ing­ton’s In­sti­tute for Health Met­rics and Eval­u­a­tion (IHME), whose fore­casts are closely watched by pol­i­cy­mak­ers in­clud­ing the White House, first pre­dicted in March that the pan­demic could kill more than 81,000 by July after eas­ing in June.</p>
    <p>In its lat­est state­ment on July 14, the IHME said its model now projects the US death toll at more than 224,000 by Nov 1.</p>
    <p>It also said that num­ber was not set in stone.</p>
    <p>“Use of masks is up, but not as high as it should be. If 95 per cent of Amer­i­cans wore masks each time they left their homes, in­fec­tion rates would drop, hos­pi­tal­i­sa­tions would drop and fore­cast deaths would drop,” it said.</p>
