    <p>Aus­tralia is ex­pe­ri­enc­ing its high­est debt lev­els since World War II, as the fed­eral gov­ern­ment rad­i­cally lifts spend­ing to try to steer the econ­omy out of the coro­n­avirus cri­sis. The pan­demic has sent un­em­ploy­ment to 7.4 per cent, the high­est level in more than two decades. But this is ex­pected to rise fur­ther to a peak of about 9.25 per cent at the end of this year.</p>
    <p>Aus­tralia is ex­pe­ri­enc­ing its high­est debt lev­els since the Sec­ond World War, as the gov­ern­ment rad­i­cally lifts spend­ing to try to steer the econ­omy out of the Covid-19 cri­sis.</p>
    <p>Trea­surer Josh Fry­den­berg re­leased a spe­cial re­port yes­ter­day that re­vealed the ex­tent of the na­tion’s eco­nomic de­scent since the out­break of the pan­demic. Af­ter 28 years of un­bro­ken growth, Aus­tralia is now set to ex­pe­ri­ence two con­sec­u­tive years of con­trac­tion for the first time since the 1930s.</p>
    <p>Mr Fry­den­berg said the huge debt that Aus­tralia was in­cur­ring high­lighted the “harsh re­al­ity” faced by the na­tion and the world. The bud­get deficit for the year to June 30 is ex­pected to come in at A$85.8 bil­lion (S$84.6 bil­lion) and hit A$184.5 bil­lion (S$181.9 bil­lion) in the 2020-21 fi­nan­cial year. “Aus­tralia is ex­pe­ri­enc­ing a health and eco­nomic cri­sis like noth­ing we have seen in the last 100 years.”</p>
    <p>The coun­try en­tered the pan­demic in a rel­a­tively strong con­di­tion. De­spite slug­gish growth and stag­nant wages, pub­lic debt and un­em­ploy­ment were rel­a­tively low and the rul­ing coali­tion was pre­par­ing to herald a small bud­get sur­plus this year, the coun­try’s first in more than a decade.</p>
    <p>But the pan­demic has dras­ti­cally re­versed its for­tunes. Aus­tralia ef­fec­tively shut down its econ­omy in March and has grad­u­ally been re­open­ing, though an out­break in Melbourne has forced the city to go back into lock­down for six weeks.</p>
    <p>Case num­bers in Melbourne, the cap­i­tal of Vic­to­ria, are at lev­els far higher than what any city ex­pe­ri­enced dur­ing the first wave of the pan­demic. Aus­tralia had recorded 13,306 con­firmed cases of Covid-19 and 133 deaths as of yes­ter­day. Of the 423 new cases re­ported, 403 were in Vic­to­ria.</p>
    <p>The pan­demic has sent un­em­ploy­ment to 7.4 per cent, the high­est level in more than two decades. But this is ex­pected to rise fur­ther to a peak of about 9.25 per cent at the end of this year.</p>
    <p>To pre­vent an even greater surge in un­em­ploy­ment, the gov­ern­ment has been pay­ing strug­gling firms to keep staff on.</p>
    <p>A JobKeeper scheme, which pro­vides A$1,500 a fort­night to sub­sidise wages, was due to end in Septem­ber. But the gov­ern­ment said this week that it will keep it un­til March 28, but re­duce it to A$1,200 a fort­night in Septem­ber and A$1,000 in Jan­uary.</p>
    <p>Like­wise, ex­tra wel­fare ben­e­fits for the un­em­ployed will also be con­tin­ued but at a re­duced sum.</p>
    <p>Prime Min­is­ter Scott Mor­ri­son said last night the debt was nec­es­sary to save jobs and lives: “It’s costly but it’s what’s nec­es­sary.”</p>
    <p>An­a­lysts largely wel­comed the move to ex­tend the JobKeeper scheme, prais­ing Mr Mor­ri­son for aban­don­ing his long-held de­ter­mi­na­tion to try to pro­duce a sur­plus.</p>
    <p>Econ­o­mist Chris Richard­son, from Deloitte Ac­cess Eco­nom­ics, said the “aw­ful” debts and deficits were nec­es­sary to as­sist busi­nesses and fam­i­lies at a time when they des­per­ately need help.</p>
    <p>“If the econ­omy were or­di­nary at the mo­ment, then I’d be up in arms about a bud­get blowout – let alone one of this stu­pen­dous size,” he wrote in The Aus­tralian Fi­nan­cial Re­view. “Yet, things right now are any­thing but or­di­nary.”</p>
    <p>But the Covid-19 surge in Melbourne has been a sober­ing re­minder that the fore­casts pre­sented yes­ter­day may yet need fur­ther rad­i­cal re­vi­sions.</p>
    <p>The gov­ern­ment has ef­fec­tively as­sumed that Melbourne’s lock­down will work and that other ma­jor cities will not en­dure sim­i­lar surges and that in­ter­na­tional travel will re­sume from Jan­uary.</p>
    <p>These may turn out to have been trag­i­cally naive pre­sump­tions.</p>
