    <p>In her 32 years at Citibank, Ms Su­san Kwek has taken on po­si­tions and roles around the world.</p>
    <p>She is now based in the bank’s Hong Kong of­fice, and heads the op­er­a­tions and tech­nol­ogy de­part­ment, over­see­ing a team of about 580 staff. Be­fore that, in her role help­ing to launch the bank’s credit card plat­form, she worked far­ther afield in Brazil, Mex­ico, Poland and London, and also around the re­gion.</p>
    <p>As a fresh-faced grad­u­ate from the pi­o­neer batch of Ngee Ann Polytech­nic’s com­puter sci­ence di­ploma course, she had joined the Na­tional Com­puter Board where she sup­ported the ex­pan­sion of com­put­er­i­sa­tion in Sin­ga­pore. Af­ter five years, when Citibank launched its credit card busi­ness in Sin­ga­pore, she grabbed the op­por­tu­nity to try for a job at the global bank.</p>
    <p>The bank had no short­age of peo­ple to choose from with a staff</p>
    <p>strength of tens of thou­sands world­wide, but it had taken a chance on Sin­ga­porean work­ers like Ms Kwek, Prime Min­is­ter Lee Hsien Loong said last week. “They saw her po­ten­tial, groomed her and ro­tated her through sev­eral op­er­a­tions and tech­nol­ogy roles, here and in the re­gion.”</p>
    <p>These stints gave her the in­ter­na­tional ex­po­sure needed to ad­vance, she tells The Sun­day Times. She counts as her proud­est achieve­ment the suc­cess­ful roll­out of the bank’s credit card plat­form world­wide.</p>
    <p>PM Lee cited her case to show that at­tract­ing for­eign com­pa­nies to Sin­ga­pore, and al­low­ing them to bring along some of their more skilled and ex­pe­ri­enced for­eign em­ploy­ees, can help Sin­ga­porean pro­fes­sion­als level up.</p>
    <p>Ms Kwek, 58, says she had com­pre­hen­sive on-the-job train­ing and was put on tal­ent de­vel­op­ment pro­grammes. “I have been given many op­por­tu­ni­ties to achieve per­sonal and pro­fes­sional growth with­out leav­ing the bank,” she says. “These op­por­tu­ni­ties, as well as the in­ter­na­tional ex­po­sure I re­ceived, pro­vided me with the abil­ity to con­stantly up­grade my skills, ex­pand my net­work be­yond Sin­ga­pore and take charge of my own ca­reer.”</p>
