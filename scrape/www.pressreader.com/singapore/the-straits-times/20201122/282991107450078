    <p>(Aus­tralia) • Ar­gentina con­tin­ued their re­mark­able Tri-Na­tions cam­paign yes­ter­day, back­ing up their maiden vic­tory over New Zealand last week with a hard-fought 15-15 draw against Aus­tralia.</p>
    <p>Pu­mas fly-half Ni­co­las Sanchez and his Wal­la­bies coun­ter­part Reece Hodge both kicked five penal­ties apiece to leave the three teams tied on points at the top of the com­pe­ti­tion stand­ings.</p>
    <p>The vis­i­tors stunned the rugby world with last week’s vic­tory over the All Blacks in what was their first Test for more than a year and once again showed their re­mark­able dura­bil­ity and spirit as they cut down a nine-point deficit in the last 16 min­utes.</p>
    <p>“Not good enough but good,” said Ar­gentina skip­per Pablo Mat­era. “They were nine points ahead but we trusted our sys­tems. Not our best per­for­mance, but we de­fended re­ally well and were re­ally dis­ci­plined.”</p>
    <p>Ar­gentina coach Mario Ledesma also claimed it was a sign of how much his side have im­proved that they could have pushed for a win if not for player fa­tigue.</p>
    <p>“We weren’t clin­i­cal and we didn’t have the shape so the boys are dis­ap­pointed with their game,” he added.</p>
    <p>“They just don’t re­alise how hard it is to play the All Blacks, with all that emo­tion and ev­ery­thing, and then play against a fresh Aus­tralia team who had a week off and en­joyed 70 per cent of pos­ses­sion.”</p>
    <p>Sanchez, who scored all of Ar­gentina’s points in their 25-15 win over New Zealand last week, was again the Pu­mas’ hero, send­ing two boom­ing kicks over from near the half­way line to level the scores.</p>
    <p>“I missed one, and maybe with that we could have won but it was a com­pli­cated match,” he said.</p>
    <p>Hodge missed a penalty two min­utes from time which would have se­cured the win for the Wal­la­bies and Dave Ren­nie’s side were left frus­trated af­ter fail­ing to gain the re­wards for their ter­ri­to­rial domi</p>
    <p>nance and not clos­ing out the match with bet­ter game man­age­ment in the last 20 min­utes.</p>
    <p>“Dis­ap­pointed. With the pos­ses­sion and field po­si­tion we had, we should have been more ac­cu­rate,” said Aus­tralia cap­tain Michael Hooper. “Re­ally pleased with some as­pects of the game but dis­ap­pointed with some penal­ties in the back end.</p>
    <p>“We tried to play with a lot of territory and I think we won that. Prob­a­bly just a bit of in­dis­ci­pline at the end and Sanchez made us pay. We were un­able to crack them tonight.”</p>
    <p>Ar­gentina face the All Blacks in New­cas­tle on Satur­day be­fore the last match of the tour­na­ment against the Wal­la­bies on Dec 5.</p>
