    <p>In the early hours of July 11, after Polling Day, Prime Min­is­ter Lee Hsien Loong an­nounced that Work­ers’ Party (WP) sec­re­tary-gen­eral Pri­tam Singh would be for­mally ap­pointed as the Leader of the Op­po­si­tion and be granted “ap­pro­pri­ate staff sup­port and re­sources to carry out his du­ties”.</p>
    <p>This came after the Peo­ple’s Ac­tion Party (PAP) swept 83 of 93 seats with 61.2 per cent of the vote – 8.7 per­cent­age points lower than in the 2015 Gen­eral Elec­tion.</p>
    <p>The WP won 10 seats, keep­ing its Hougang SMC and Alju­nied GRC stronghold­s and adding Sengkang GRC to its fold.</p>
    <p>Ac­knowl­edg­ing the re­sult, PM Lee stated that these de­vel­op­ments rep­re­sent the elec­torate’s “clear de­sire for a di­ver­sity of voices in Par­lia­ment”. With a po­lit­i­cal mas­ter stroke, he un­ex­pect­edly and for­mally ap­pointed Mr Singh as the Leader of the Op­po­si­tion.</p>
    <p>No op­po­si­tion Mem­ber of Par­lia­ment in the his­tory of Sin­ga­pore had been be­stowed the ti­tle un­til now, so the move has sig­nif­i­cance.</p>
    <p>The ti­tle of “Leader of the Op­po­si­tion” first sur­faced in Sin­ga­pore pol­i­tics al­most 30 years ago, when then Leader of the House Wong Kan Seng used it to re­fer to Mr Chiam See Tong. Mr Chiam, MP for Po­tong Pasir, was then leader of the Sin­ga­pore Demo­cratic Party, which had three op­po­si­tion seats in Par­lia­ment in 1991. A fourth was held by the WP’s Low Thia Khi­ang.</p>
    <p>In 2011, Mr Low was also of­fered the ti­tle of un­of­fi­cial leader of the op­po­si­tion after the WP won six seats in Par­lia­ment, but he de­clined the ti­tle, ob­ject­ing to the “un­of­fi­cial” pre­fix.</p>
    <p>The note­wor­thy dif­fer­ence be­tween then and now will be that this time, the word “un­of­fi­cial” will not ac­com­pany that ti­tle.</p>
    <p>A ti­tle con­fers pres­tige and power – and with greater power comes greater re­spon­si­bil­ity – and higher ex­pec­ta­tions from vot­ers and higher stakes for the op­po­si­tion.</p>
    <p>There­fore, as Sin­ga­pore evolves into a more ma­ture democ­racy, the op­po­si­tion can­not rest on its lau­rels or risk mak­ing a mis­take that neu­tralises its progress, or worse, re­sults in a wipe-out from Par­lia­ment.</p>
    <p>LEADER OF THE OP­PO­SI­TION</p>
    <p>Since Sin­ga­pore mod­elled its par­lia­men­tary sys­tem after Bri­tain’s West­min­ster sys­tem, what in­sights can we draw from the role of Leader of the Op­po­si­tion in Bri­tain?</p>
    <p>A stir was caused among le­gal academia in Bri­tain last year when then leader of the Labour Party Jeremy Cor­byn stated that should the Boris John­son gov­ern­ment fail, he, as the Leader of the Op­po­si­tion, would as­sume the re­spon­si­bil­i­ties of gov­ern­ment.</p>
    <p>While his state­ment may not be an ac­cu­rate ac­count of the con­se­quences, this im­plies the sig­nif­i­cance of the of­fi­cial ti­tle of the Leader of the Op­po­si­tion.</p>
    <p>Some ne­ti­zens have pointed to Mr Cor­byn’s pro­nounce­ment and raised the ques­tion of whether a sim­i­lar con­sid­er­a­tion ap­plies in Sin­ga­pore – and whether, in the event of a col­lapse of the Gov­ern­ment, Mr Singh, as the Leader of the Op­po­si­tion, would take over and lead the Gov­ern­ment. The sim­ple an­swer is “no”.</p>
    <p>First and fore­most, the fal­lacy in Mr Cor­byn’s state­ment is that the Leader of the Op­po­si­tion and his shadow Cab­i­net will be called upon to lead the gov­ern­ment when the in­cum­bent re­signs.</p>
    <p>When Mrs Theresa May’s gov­ern­ment re­signed in the mid­dle of last year, it was not the Leader of the Op­po­si­tion that was called upon to lead but an­other mem­ber of the rul­ing party, Mr John­son.</p>
    <p>The un­der­pin­ning prin­ci­ple be­hind this is that the MP called upon to lead the gov­ern­ment should be some­one who is best placed to en­sure sta­ble ad­min­is­tra­tion of the gov­ern­ment, re­gard­less of whether that per­son is the Leader of the Op­po­si­tion or an­other mem­ber of the rul­ing party.</p>
    <p>Given the de­mo­graph­ics of the Sin­ga­pore Par­lia­ment, it is un­likely that Mr Singh will be able to com­mand the con­fi­dence of the ma­jor­ity of the MPs. There­fore, it is highly un­likely that Mr Singh would be called upon to lead the Gov­ern­ment in the re­mote pos­si­bil­ity of res­ig­na­tion by the in­cum­bent Gov­ern­ment.</p>
    <p>SHADOW CAB­I­NET</p>
    <p>Draw­ing from Bri­tain and other Com­mon­wealth ex­am­ples, some peo­ple have also asked if Mr Singh will then be tasked to form a shadow Cab­i­net.</p>
    <p>Prior to the for­mal­is­ing of the role of the Leader of the Op­po­si­tion in Sin­ga­pore, the Op­po­si­tion could only act as a check and bal­ance by de­bat­ing the poli­cies put for­ward by the Gov­ern­ment.</p>
    <p>In re­spond­ing to the cre­ation of this new role in Par­lia­ment, Emer­i­tus Se­nior Min­is­ter Goh Chok Tong stated that this would mean that the op­po­si­tion MPs in Par­lia­ment must now go be­yond that ini­tial re­spon­si­bil­ity to tabling al­ter­na­tive pro­pos­als to the Gov­ern­ment’s poli­cies.</p>
    <p>Or­di­nar­ily, un­der the West­min­ster sys­tem, the Leader of the Op­po­si­tion would lead the shadow Cab­i­net, a coali­tion of op­po­si­tion MPs that mir­rors the Cab­i­net of min­is­ters. The pri­mary func­tions of the shadow Cab­i­net are to en­sure that the acts of the gov­ern­ment would be prop­erly scru­ti­nised and to put forth al­ter­na­tive poli­cies for de­bate.</p>
    <p>The def­i­ni­tion of the “Leader of the Op­po­si­tion” in the glos­sary page of the Sin­ga­pore Par­lia­ment’s web­site states that the largest mi­nor­ity party “will form a shadow cab­i­net that is led by the Leader of the Op­po­si­tion”, yet it is un­likely that a shadow Cab­i­net can be con­sti­tuted in the 14th Par­lia­ment of Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>The Sin­ga­pore Cab­i­net has nearly 20 mem­bers, but there are only 10 WP MPs. This makes it dif­fi­cult for the WP to form a shadow Cab­i­net, un­less each WP MP spreads him­self or her­self thin to over­see mul­ti­ple min­istry or pol­icy ar­eas. But this would com­pro­mise de­bate and the abil­ity to pro­pose fea­si­ble al­ter­na­tives. So hopes for the WP to put for­ward a com­pre­hen­sive slate of al­ter­na­tive poli­cies with a shadow Cab­i­net are un­re­al­is­tic.</p>
    <p>AC­CESS TO IN­FOR­MA­TION</p>
    <p>An­other chal­lenge that the Leader of the Op­po­si­tion faces would be the lack of ex­pe­ri­ence in gov­ern­ment and non-do­mes­tic is­sues.</p>
    <p>To date, the ex­pe­ri­ence of the op­po­si­tion in Sin­ga­pore pol­i­tics has been lim­ited to de­bat­ing against gov­ern­ment poli­cies with­out full ac­cess to the in­for­ma­tion which is avail­able to the Gov­ern­ment.</p>
    <p>Ear­lier this year, one can ob­serve from Mr Singh’s de­bate with the Gov­ern­ment on its for­eign worker pol­icy that he had no ac­cess to key in­for­ma­tion rel­e­vant to the de­bate de­spite re­peated re­quests.</p>
    <p>To play an ef­fec­tive role as the Leader of the Op­po­si­tion, Mr Singh will re­quire ac­cess to in­for­ma­tion held by the rel­e­vant min­istries to mean­ing­fully en­gage the Gov­ern­ment in a par­lia­men­tary de­bate.</p>
    <p>One is re­minded of for­mer pres­i­dent Ong Teng Cheong’s re­quests for in­for­ma­tion re­lat­ing to the as­sets held by the coun­try – which were met with bu­reau­cratic red tape and bar­ri­cades. Thus, it is im­por­tant that the right of the Leader of the Op­po­si­tion to ac­cess doc­u­ments and the rel­e­vant pro­ce­dures be clearly set out.</p>
    <p>More im­por­tantly, it is hoped that the Leader of the Op­po­si­tion, the Gov­ern­ment and the civil ser­vice will em­brace the ob­jec­tives of the role of the Leader of the Op­po­si­tion and not let pol­i­tics get in the way.</p>
    <p>As the Leader of the Op­po­si­tion is a par­lia­men­tary role, he should be given re­course to par­lia­men­tary dis­ci­plinary pro­cesses if he is de­nied or blocked from ac­cess to in­for­ma­tion re­quired to per­form his role. For ex­am­ple, such acts can be con­strued as con­tempt of</p>
    <p>Par­lia­ment and treated as such if there is ev­i­dence of such be­hav­iour.</p>
    <p>Such re­course would cer­tainly act as an in­cen­tive to the Gov­ern­ment and the civil ser­vice to hold them­selves to even higher stan­dards of pro­bity and in­tegrity.</p>
    <p>As the terms “Leader of the Op­po­si­tion” and “shadow Cab­i­net” are still ab­sent in the Constituti­on of the Republic of Sin­ga­pore, the de­tails on the scope of Mr Singh’s du­ties and the spe­cific ex­tent of re­sources that will be ac­corded to him re­main an open-ended ques­tion.</p>
    <p>Un­less the ex­tent of re­sources given to Mr Singh is mean­ing­ful and ad­e­quate (in­clud­ing a de­cent pay scale cur­rently en­joyed by the Cab­i­net), the role en­vis­aged by PM Lee may be one which is set for fail­ure from the get-go.</p>
    <p>PO­TEN­TIAL EF­FECTS ON SIN­GA­PORE POL­I­TICS</p>
    <p>So far, I have made the ob­ser­va­tion that ap­point­ing a Leader of the Op­po­si­tion does not mean the WP is ca­pa­ble at this stage in its de­vel­op­ment of form­ing an al­ter­na­tive gov­ern­ment or hav­ing a shadow Cab­i­net.</p>
    <p>It is im­por­tant to set right ex­pec­ta­tions of the elec­torate.</p>
    <p>How­ever, it is clear that the op­po­si­tion will be ex­pected by the elec­torate to fill a much big­ger shoe than at present – go­ing be­yond crit­i­cis­ing poli­cies to propos­ing al­ter­na­tives, such as for­mu­lat­ing poli­cies to be tabled in Par­lia­ment.</p>
    <p>One such ex­am­ple is the Free­dom of In­for­ma­tion Act, much clam­oured after by the op­po­si­tion and sec­tions of the pub­lic.</p>
    <p>Higher ex­pec­ta­tions of the op­po­si­tion from the elec­torate will nat­u­rally lead to greater scru­tiny of the op­po­si­tion.</p>
    <p>In other words, the un­ques­tion­able ef­fect of the for­mal­is­ing of the Leader of the Op­po­si­tion in Sin­ga­pore is that the WP can be ex­pected to be ap­praised by the pub­lic on its abil­ity to lead the coun­try, not just op­pose the Gov­ern­ment.</p>
    <p>This means that if the WP does not live up to the higher ex­pec­ta­tions of the elec­torate, the “risk of a wipe-out with no elected op­po­si­tion rep­re­sented by the WP” stated by Mr Singh will be even more real than be­fore.</p>
    <p>Con­versely, if the WP does live up to or ex­ceed these ex­pec­ta­tions, vot­ers will be more con­vinced that a di­ver­sity of views and robust de­bate on poli­cies will be ben­e­fi­cial, and one can ex­pect the WP and the op­po­si­tion to make fur­ther in­roads into Par­lia­ment.</p>
    <p>Then, the WP prom­ise of deny­ing the PAP a “blank cheque” will be ful­filled, if it suc­ceeds in deny­ing the PAP a su­per or even sim­ple ma­jor­ity in even­tual elec­tions.</p>
    <p>In that sense, the for­mal ap­point­ment of Leader of the Op­po­si­tion is a dou­ble-edged sword.</p>
    <p>It will de­fine the fu­ture of op­po­si­tion rep­re­sen­ta­tion in Sin­ga­pore pol­i­tics, but whether it aids or im­pedes op­po­si­tion par­ties’ de­vel­op­ment in Par­lia­ment de­pends greatly on how the WP makes use of the op­por­tu­ni­ties the ti­tle af­fords, and the ex­tent to which it is able to har­ness re­sources promised by the Gov­ern­ment.</p>
    <p>The Sin­ga­pore Cab­i­net has nearly 20 mem­bers, but there are only 10 WP MPs. This makes it dif­fi­cult for the WP to form a shadow Cab­i­net, un­less each WP MP spreads him­self or her­self thin to over­see mul­ti­ple min­istry or pol­icy ar­eas. But this would com­pro­mise de­bate and the abil­ity to pro­pose fea­si­ble al­ter­na­tives.</p>
