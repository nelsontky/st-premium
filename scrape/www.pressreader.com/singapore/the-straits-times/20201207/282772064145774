    <p>A great hu­man­ist story, con­fi­dent and nu­anced, with a strong script and en­gag­ing di­rec­tion.</p>
    <p>This was how the jury for the 31st Sin­ga­pore In­ter­na­tional Film Fes­ti­val’s Sil­ver Screen Awards de­scribed In­dian direc­tor Ivan Ayr’s film, Mile­stone, which won Best Film un­der the Asian Fea­ture Film Com­pe­ti­tion cat­e­gory.</p>
    <p>The win­ners for this year’s awards were an­nounced yes­ter­day, on the last day of the fes­ti­val.</p>
    <p>Mile­stone, a film about an age­ing Pun­jabi trucker in New Delhi who finds his life stalled by a work­ers’ strike, the loss of his wife and an in­ex­pli­ca­ble pain in his back, also won ac­tor Su­vin­der Vicky an award for Best Per­for­mance.</p>
    <p>Ayr re­counted the chal­lenges of work­ing on the film dur­ing the pan­demic, adding that shoot­ing for the film was com­pleted in early Fe­bru­ary when he started to no­tice news about the coro­n­avirus.</p>
    <p>“I hon­estly never imag­ined any­thing like a lock­down in my wildest dreams, but soon enough, I found my­self edit­ing the film alone, star­ing at un­cer­tainty and fight­ing anx­i­ety at­tacks.”</p>
    <p>He added: “Film fes­ti­vals are more im­por­tant than ever in these times as hu­man­ity, now sep­a­rated by bor­der clo­sures, needs to un­der­stand our lives are much more closely con­nected than we had imag­ined. And what bet­ter way to learn about each other than through sto­ries.”</p>
    <p>Ge­or­gian direc­tor Dea Ku­lum­be­gashvili picked up the Best Direc­tor award un­der the Asian Fea­ture Film cat­e­gory with her film, Be­gin­ning. The film is cen­tred on a Je­ho­vah’s Wit­nesses mis­sion­ary seek­ing jus­tice in a re­mote Ge­or­gian town fol­low­ing an at­tack on her church.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­porean direc­tor Nel­son Yeo’s Here Is Not There won the Best Sin­ga­pore Short Film award un­der the South-east Asian Short Film Com­pe­ti­tion cat­e­gory.</p>
    <p>Set in the still­ness of the grave­yard shift, the film tells the story of two lovers as they re­flect on the tran­si­tory lives they lead in Sin­ga­pore and wres­tle with the in­evitabil­ity of their fates.</p>
    <p>The jury de­scribed the film as in­spir­ing and praised its am­bi­tion in ad­dress­ing im­por­tant is­sues sur­round­ing mi­grant work­ers, ex­ploita­tion, work-re­lated in­jury and dis­crim­i­na­tion against preg­nant women in the work­place.</p>
    <p>“I guess the third time’s the charm,” said Yeo, who had par­tic­i­pated in the film fes­ti­val twice be­fore this year.</p>
    <p>He added: “The pan­demic this year forces us to re­think our pri­or­i­ties.</p>
    <p>“No mat­ter how good or bad the times are, I be­lieve that there are sto­ries worth telling and, for us, films worth mak­ing.”</p>
