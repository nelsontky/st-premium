    <p>BOUNC­ING BACK STRONGER</p>
    <p>The Covid-19 pan­demic has brought into sharp re­lief the chal­lenges coun­tries face in the sup­ply of food and other es­sen­tials, and it is crit­i­cal that economies in the Asia-Pa­cific work to­gether to strengthen sup­ply chains and keep trade flow­ing, two Sin­ga­pore min­is­ters said.</p>
    <p>Speak­ing at the Asia-Pa­cific Eco­nomic Co­op­er­a­tion (Apec) min­is­te­rial meet­ing held vir­tu­ally on Mon­day night, Sec­ond Min­is­ter for For­eign Af­fairs Maliki Os­man said: “As few economies are self­suf­fi­cient in food, it is es­sen­tial for Apec to work more closely to­gether and keep trade flow­ing dur­ing a crisis.”</p>
    <p>He added that this will en­sure “that we have a re­silient food sup­ply chain which can with­stand fu­ture shocks, and is un­der­pinned by an open, rules-based mul­ti­lat­eral trad­ing sys­tem”.</p>
    <p>Min­is­ter for Trade and In­dus­try Chan Chun Sing, who was also at the meet­ing, spoke on the im­por­tance of Apec economies work­ing to­gether to sup­port the re­gion’s eco­nomic re­cov­ery.</p>
    <p>Mr Chan said in a Face­book post yes­ter­day: “In th­ese chal­leng­ing times, it is es­pe­cially vi­tal for us to strengthen our sup­ply chains, up­hold con­nec­tiv­ity be­tween economies, keep mar­kets open and fos­ter greater re­gional co­op­er­a­tion. This will put us in a bet­ter po­si­tion to seize op­por­tu­ni­ties be­yond our shores and al­low us to bounce back stronger from the crisis.”</p>
    <p>Their re­marks at the meet­ing hosted by this year’s Apec chair­man Malaysia come amid a re­newed com­mit­ment by min­is­ters from the 21 Apec economies to ad­vance re­gional trade and in­vest­ment, and ahead of the Apec Eco­nomic Lead­ers’ Meet­ing this Fri­day.</p>
    <p>In a joint state­ment af­ter their meet­ing, the Apec min­is­ters said: “We are com­mit­ted to work­ing to­gether to fa­cil­i­tate the move­ment of es­sen­tial goods and ser­vices across bor­ders and, with­out un­der­min­ing ef­forts to pre­vent the spread of the virus, ex­plore ways to fa­cil­i­tate the es­sen­tial move­ment of peo­ple across bor­ders.”</p>
    <p>The start of the pan­demic saw many coun­tries scram­bling to pro­cure much needed med­i­cal sup­plies as just-in-time sup­ply chains col­lapsed with port and air­port op­er­a­tions halted when coun­tries went into lockdown to stem the spread of the virus.</p>
    <p>Dr Maliki, in his re­marks re­leased yes­ter­day, said: “This has badly af­fected economies that are heav­ily de­pen­dent on ex­ports, as well as the liveli­hoods of farm­ers and traders who could not sell their prod­ucts, many of which were per­ish­ables. It also af­fects non-agri­cul­tural economies de­pen­dent on food im­ports for their peo­ple.”</p>
    <p>The meet­ing also dis­cussed the chal­lenges brought by the Covid-19 pan­demic to the econ­omy and so­ci­ety, and the joint state­ment ac­knowl­edged the dis­pro­por­tion­ate im­pact on small en­ter­prises, women and other vul­ner­a­ble groups.</p>
    <p>Dr Maliki urged his coun­ter­parts to work to­gether on step­ping up the trans­for­ma­tion of the dig­i­tal econ­omy and en­sur­ing that all seg­ments of so­ci­ety can ben­e­fit from it.</p>
    <p>He also called on Apec economies to sup­port vac­cine mul­ti­lat­er­al­ism and the fair and eq­ui­table ac­cess to di­ag­nos­tics, ther­a­peu­tics and vac­cines.</p>
    <p>In the mean­time, economies can ex­plore how to re­open bor­ders in a safe and cal­i­brated man­ner, he said, not­ing that restor­ing confidence and the flow of peo­ple is es­sen­tial for the full re­cov­ery of economies. Sin­ga­pore has worked to es­tab­lish re­cip­ro­cal green lanes with six coun­tries – Brunei, China, In­done­sia, Ja­pan, Malaysia and South Korea – as well as an air travel bub­ble with Hong Kong.</p>
    <p>Dr Maliki said rel­e­vant health pro­to­cols have been put in place to pre­vent the trans­mis­sion of Covid-19, and if the model proves to work it could be a for­mula for es­tab­lish­ing a wider net­work of travel which can help re­vive the hard­est-hit avi­a­tion and tourism sec­tors.</p>
    <p>“There is much we can do to­gether to over­come this global crisis,” he added.</p>
    <p>“Apec can help lead a process to­wards a ro­bust eco­nomic re­cov­ery and create a re­gion that is more re­silient to fu­ture shocks so that fu­ture gen­er­a­tions can ben­e­fit from the ef­forts we have made to­day.”</p>
    <p>In th­ese chal­leng­ing times, it is es­pe­cially vi­tal for us to strengthen our sup­ply chains, up­hold con­nec­tiv­ity be­tween economies, keep mar­kets open and fos­ter greater re­gional co­op­er­a­tion. This will put us in a bet­ter po­si­tion to seize op­por­tu­ni­ties be­yond our shores and al­low us to bounce back stronger from the crisis.</p>
