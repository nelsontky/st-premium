    <p>My eight-year-old pomera­nian</p>
    <p>(left) fails to clear his bow­els daily. Why is this so? I am wor­ried he may not feel well when he does not pass mo­tion reg­u­larly.</p>
    <p>Also, is it ad­vis­able to neuter him? His weighs about 2kg.</p>
    <p>He also likes to lick the fur on his paws. I would like him to stop do­ing this as he tends to gag while try­ing to cough out the fur that ac­cu­mu­lates in his throat.</p>
    <p>Nikki Ke­lana</p>
    <p>Apart from not defe­cat­ing daily, are there any changes to his ap­petite or signs that your pomera­nian is not feel­ing well? This may war­rant a visit to the vet.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing defe­ca­tion, is he also show­ing signs of con­sti­pa­tion such as strain­ing ex­ces­sively. Does his stool ap­pear hard and dry or is there blood in his ex­cre­ment?</p>
    <p>If so, you need to see a vet to rule out any un­der­ly­ing med­i­cal con­di­tions. Al­ter­na­tively, this might be re­solved sim­ply by in­tro­duc­ing more fi­bre to his diet. En­sur­ing wa­ter is al­ways avail­able will also help with bet­ter bowel move­ment.</p>
    <p>On the is­sue of neu­ter­ing, weight is only one fac­tor when as­sess­ing a dog’s suit­abil­ity.</p>
    <p>Usu­ally, a gen­eral ex­am­i­na­tion and some­times a blood test is done be­fore surgery to as­sess whether the an­i­mal is healthy enough to un­dergo anaes­the­sia and surgery.</p>
    <p>Your vet will have to con­sider all th­ese fac­tors be­fore mak­ing a rec­om­men­da­tion.</p>
    <p>For ex­ces­sive lick­ing of his paws, it is im­por­tant to first rule out any skin in­fec­tion – such as par­a­sites, yeast or bac­te­ria – that might cause itch­ing. There could be other causes of itch as well, such as food or con­tact al­ler­gies.</p>
    <p>There could also be be­havioural causes of ex­ces­sive lick­ing, which are usu­ally di­ag­nosed only af­ter rul­ing out in­fec­tion and al­lergy.</p>
