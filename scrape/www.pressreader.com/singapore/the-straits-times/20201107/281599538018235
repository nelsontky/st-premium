    <p>•</p>
    <p>WASH­ING­TON US pres­i­den­tial hope­ful Joe Bi­den is well within sight of the White House, but with Repub­li­cans tipped to re­tain con­trol of the Se­nate and in­creas­ing their share of seats in the House of Rep­re­sen­ta­tives, the Demo­crat is likely to face sig­nif­i­cant ob­struc­tion to his leg­isla­tive agenda.</p>
    <p>In such a sit­u­a­tion, Mr Bi­den will have to rely on his rep­u­ta­tion as a bi­par­ti­san deal­maker to push his poli­cies through Congress.</p>
    <p>In that re­spect, Mr Bi­den will also have to lever­age pow­ers, such as his abil­ity to force a gov­ern­ment shut­down, in or­der to get the Repub­li­cans to play ball.</p>
    <p>The linch­pin of Mr Bi­den’s man­i­festo has been a prom­ise to “Build Back Bet­ter” af­ter the pan­demic left the Amer­i­can econ­omy in tat­ters.</p>
    <p>At the fore­front of the ef­forts will be na­tion­wide test­ing for</p>
    <p>Covid-19, a Public Health Jobs Corps, the cre­ation of mas­sive vac­cine stock­piles ahead of ap­proval for speedy de­ploy­ment and haz­ard pay for es­sen­tial work­ers.</p>
    <p>His eco­nomic re­cov­ery plan aims to spend US$700 bil­lion (S$943 bil­lion) on man­u­fac­tur­ing and re­search and de­vel­op­ment to ex­pand jobs in these sec­tors, as well as a US$2 tril­lion in­vest­ment in clean en­ergy and a clean elec­tric­ity stan­dard that elim­i­nates car­bon from elec­tric­ity pro­duc­tion by 2035.</p>
    <p>In ad­di­tion, Mr Bi­den has pledged to pay health in­sur­ance costs for newly un­em­ployed peo­ple and of­fer mid­dle class par­ents and care­tak­ers US$8,000 a year for child or long-term care sup­port.</p>
    <p>Whether Mr Bi­den will be able to achieve his pol­icy goals, how­ever, may hinge on a call that he was set to make to Se­nate Ma­jor­ity Leader Mitch Mc­Connell, pos­si­bly as early as yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>While the two men have not spo­ken yet – with a Bi­den aide not­ing that it would be pre­ma­ture be­fore the elec­tion re­sult has been de­clared – they have a long re­la­tion­ship af­ter serv­ing in the Se­nate for decades and also while work­ing to­gether to cut deals dur­ing the</p>
    <p>Obama ad­min­is­tra­tion.</p>
    <p>As ma­jor­ity leader of the Se­nate – a prospect that is look­ing in­creas­ingly likely – Mr Mc­Connell will play a ma­jor role in ap­prov­ing mem­bers of any pos­si­ble Bi­den Cabi­net, and also in the leg­isla­tive process should Mr Bi­den be elected.</p>
    <p>Both par­ties have plans, and there is al­ways a risk that if Mr Bi­den and Mr Mc­Connell are un­able to work to­gether, stale­mates</p>
    <p>over dif­fer­ences such as the con­tours of a stim­u­lus pack­age for the econ­omy may be­come par for the course.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, Ger­many has called on Pres­i­dent Trump to play by the rules and ac­cept the re­sult of the US pres­i­den­tial elec­tion, in a rare diplo­matic in­ter­ven­tion by a key West­ern ally.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump’s ap­peal to end the count­ing of bal­lots “doesn’t com­ply with the demo­cratic cul­ture” of the US, For­eign Min­is­ter Heiko Maas told public broad­caster ARD on Thurs­day.</p>
    <p>“It is easy to be a win­ner, but some­times it is quite hard to be a loser,” Mr Maas said. “It is im­por­tant that in the end, the re­sult will be ac­cepted by every­body.”</p>
    <p>In a sep­a­rate in­ter­view with ZDF tele­vi­sion yes­ter­day, Mr Maas said it is “per­haps a bit scary” that peo­ple are no longer sur­prised by Mr Trump’s be­hav­iour, “al­though one re­ally doesn’t want to be­lieve it”.</p>
    <p>“One thing is very cer­tain: that the next Amer­i­can pres­i­dent has a very im­por­tant and out­stand­ing task, that is to end the po­lar­i­sa­tion in the coun­try and bring so­ci­ety to­gether again,” he said. “That is what the next pres­i­dent is needed for.”</p>
    <p>Ger­many has a track record of keep­ing a low pro­file when it comes to for­eign pol­icy and avoid­ing con­tro­ver­sial po­si­tions. In this case, it is tak­ing a clear stand in try­ing to steer Mr Trump to ac­cept what­ever the re­sult is when it comes.</p>
    <p>Sep­a­rately, French Trade Min­is­ter Franck Ri­ester said France ex­pects smoother trade re­la­tions with the United States should Demo­cratic con­tender Bi­den win the pres­i­den­tial vote, with greater align­ment on sus­tain­able de­vel­op­ment and more mul­ti­lat­eral co­op­er­a­tion.</p>
    <p>Asked if France an­tic­i­pated that a Bi­den pres­i­dency would be more rec­on­cil­ing, Mr Ri­ester said: “We would surely see an im­prove­ment in re­la­tions. We would be more aligned on mat­ters of sus­tain­able de­vel­op­ment and per­haps also on mul­ti­lat­eral work.”</p>
    <p>A top Turk­ish of­fi­cial said yes­ter­day that Turkey is ready to work with who­ever wins the US elec­tion, de­spite a friend­ship with Mr Trump that has helped the two coun­tries through tur­bu­lent times.</p>
    <p>“Re­gard­less of which can­di­date takes of­fice in the US, we will pur­sue a sin­cere ap­proach to im­prove our re­la­tions,” For­eign Min­is­ter Mev­lut Cavu­soglu said.</p>
