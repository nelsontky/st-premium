    <p>MOSCOW • Rus­sia will scale down state sup­port of the econ­omy next year due to the ris­ing cost of ser­vic­ing bur­geon­ing debt amid the Covid-19 pan­demic and a col­lapse in oil prices, says Fi­nance Min­is­ter An­ton Silu­anov.</p>
    <p>Run­ning out of op­tions to bol­ster pub­lic fi­nances, Rus­sia has more than dou­bled its do­mes­tic bor­row­ing this year, raised some taxes and in­creased state spending as it re­laxed its budget rule that shields the econ­omy from ex­ter­nal shocks.</p>
    <p>Rus­sia’s ex­tra state spending to sup­port the econ­omy this year reached 4.5 per cent of gross do­mes­tic prod­uct (GDP) and will shrink to 1 per cent of GDP next year, Mr Silu­anov told re­porters in com­ments cleared for pub­li­ca­tion yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Nev­er­the­less, state de­vel­op­ment bank VEB may buy into pre­ferred shares of state-run Rus­sian Rail­ways to pro­vide the lat­ter with funds for its in­vest­ment pro­gramme, he said.</p>
    <p>He shrugged off the World Bank’s sug­ges­tions that Moscow can opt for a more grad­ual fis­cal con­sol­i­da­tion than cur­rently planned. “If we con­tin­ued the same pol­icy as this year, we would pull out money from the econ­omy... We can’t with­draw all the liq­uid­ity from the mar­ket and fi­nance spending,” he said.</p>
    <p>The Fi­nance Min­istry raised nearly 5.3 tril­lion rou­bles (S$95.61 bil­lion) by sell­ing OFZ Trea­sury bonds in the do­mes­tic mar­ket this year, with the bulk of the bonds pur­chased by ma­jor banks, which dented rouble liq­uid­ity lev­els in the in­ter­bank sys­tem.</p>
    <p>Rus­sia has to re­turn to the budget rule in 2022, Mr Silu­anov said, re­fer­ring to the budget sys­tem praised by the In­ter­na­tional Mone­tary Fund and the World Bank. “If so, then we can’t keep our spending high all the time.</p>
    <p>“We carry out re­spon­si­ble pol­icy un­like other coun­tries that flood and will flood their economies with money.”</p>
    <p>Rus­sia’s debt-to-GDP ra­tio has al­ready reached 20 per cent, the level which the min­istry did not want to ex­ceed, and spending on ser­vic­ing debt will rise to 1.4 tril­lion rou­bles in 2023 from up to 800 bil­lion rou­bles this year.</p>
    <p>Rus­sia has no plans to raise taxes after hikes this year, Mr Silu­anov said.</p>
    <p>Run­ning out of op­tions to bol­ster pub­lic fi­nances, Rus­sia has more than dou­bled its do­mes­tic bor­row­ing this year, raised some taxes and in­creased state spending as it re­laxed its budget rule that shields the econ­omy from ex­ter­nal shocks.</p>
