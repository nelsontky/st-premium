    <p>Vi­o­lin­ist Koh Su Ting Natalie, 22, has been named the win­ner of this year’s Goh Soon Tioe Cen­te­nary Award, which is given to a young string player with a strong track record of mu­si­cian­ship and per­for­mance.</p>
    <p>She will re­ceive $10,000 in prize money – the high­est amount since the an­nual award in hon­our of the late pi­o­neer vi­o­lin­ist and con­duc­tor Goh Soon Tioe was es­tab­lished in 2011.</p>
    <p>Ms Koh, who grad­u­ated with hon­ours ear­lier this year from the Yong Siew Toh Con­ser­va­tory of Mu­sic at the Na­tional Uni­ver­sity of Sin­ga­pore, is cur­rently a teach­ing ap­pren­tice at the con­ser­va­tory.</p>
    <p>Vet­eran vi­o­lin­ist Vivien Goh, one of the four judges and the daugh­ter of Mr Goh, says Ms Koh was cho­sen out of a pool of six ac­com­plished can­di­dates as her “mu­si­cal ma­tu­rity” was well above the oth­ers.</p>
    <p>Ms Koh is de­lighted with the win. She hopes to run her own vi­o­lin stu­dio in the fu­ture and “get more youth en­gaged in lis­ten­ing and per­form­ing chamber mu­sic”.</p>
    <p>Her par­ents hold jobs in the IT sec­tor. “My whole fam­ily doesn’t lis­ten to clas­si­cal mu­sic,” she says with a laugh and a shake of her head.</p>
    <p>But a love of the arts in all its forms re­mains strong in the Koh fam­ily – her 19-year-old brother, cur­rently un­der­go­ing na­tional ser­vice, had grad­u­ated from the School of the Arts Sin­ga­pore, spe­cial­is­ing in vis­ual arts.</p>
    <p>While the win­ner of the award usu­ally gives a per­for­mance, this has been pushed back to the sec­ond half of next year as a re­sult of the coro­n­avirus pan­demic.</p>
    <p>For Ms Koh, an en­thu­si­as­tic chamber mu­si­cian, Covid-19 has put a damp­ener on her plans.</p>
    <p>“Con­certs were can­celled, in­clud­ing my grad­u­a­tion recital from the Yong Siew Toh Con­ser­va­tory of Mu­sic.</p>
    <p>“I also had to take my vi­o­lin teach­ing and mu­sic work­shops on­line dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker.”</p>
    <p>Ms Koh has also put her plans to fur­ther her stud­ies on hold and will be head­ing to DePaul Uni­ver­sity’s School of Mu­sic in Chicago only in au­tumn next year.</p>
    <p>But she is en­joy­ing ev­ery bit of mu­sic that seeps its way into her life, adding that she got to re­hearse for the Goh Soon Tioe Cen­te­nary Award au­di­tion, “which was great”, though she “longs for the day (she) can re­turn to play­ing in a large en­sem­ble or an or­ches­tra”.</p>
    <p>The Goh Soon Tioe Cen­te­nary Award, which is ad­min­is­tered by The Com­mu­nity Foun­da­tion of Sin­ga­pore, a phil­an­thropic or­gan­i­sa­tion, has given out nine awards since its in­cep­tion.</p>
