    <p>BEI­JING • A Chi­nese prime-time tele­vi­sion drama about the coro­n­avirus pan­demic has been slammed by so­cial me­dia users, who ac­cused it of sex­ism for down­play­ing the role of women in bat­tling the deadly out­break at ground zero.</p>
    <p>China has largely brought the virus un­der con­trol since it first emerged late last year, though Bei­jing has rushed to re­shape the of­fi­cial nar­ra­tive fol­low­ing crit­i­cism that it mis­han­dled its ini­tial re­sponse and pun­ished whis­tle-blow­ers.</p>
    <p>But the new show, He­roes In Harm’s Way – first aired by state broad­caster CCTV last Thurs­day – has trig­gered a fierce on­line back­lash for its de­pic­tion of women in the virus bat­tle.</p>
    <p>One con­tro­ver­sial scene set in the virus ground-zero city of Wuhan showed fe­male bus driv­ers be­ing re­luc­tant to vol­un­teer for a de­liv­ery team due to fam­ily com­mit­ments – while their male col­leagues did not hes­i­tate.</p>
    <p>Users on the Twit­ter-like plat­form Weibo re­posted state me­dia news re­ports prais­ing real-life fe­male bus driv­ers and vol­un­teers and ar­gued women had been vi­tal in trans­port­ing sup­plies and med­i­cal staff around the locked­down city.</p>
    <p>“Women have made such a huge con­tri­bu­tion to fight the epi­demic... The pan­demic is still not over, but they rushed to smear women,” read one com­ment with more than 15,000 likes.</p>
    <p>“This tele­vi­sion series ig­nores fe­male bus driv­ers’ con­tri­bu­tions to fight­ing the epi­demic. The im­plicit gen­der dis­crim­i­na­tion in these kinds of film and tele­vi­sion works should be re­dressed,” wrote an­other user.</p>
    <p>The Weibo hash­tag “Boy­cott He­roes In Harm’s Way” was re­moved from so­cial me­dia last week­end, but an­other hash­tag con­sist­ing of the pro­gramme’s ti­tle had been viewed more than 2.4 bil­lion times by yes­ter­day af­ter­noon.</p>
    <p>In re­al­ity, the ma­jor­ity of front-line med­i­cal work­ers dur­ing the out­break in Wuhan were women, ac­cord­ing to of­fi­cial data and me­dia re­ports.</p>
    <p>More than 90 per cent of the 28,600 nurses dis­patched to Hubei prov­ince – of which Wuhan is the cap­i­tal – were women, a health min­istry of­fi­cial said in April.</p>
    <p>In March, a Peo­ple’s Daily re­port said of the more than 40,000 med­i­cal work­ers de­ployed to Hubei, two-thirds were women.</p>
    <p>State broad­caster CGTN also ran a fea­ture in April pro­fil­ing a fe­male chef and driver de­liv­er­ing meals to medics.</p>
    <p>The show’s rat­ing on Douban – China’s equiv­a­lent of Amer­i­can on­line movie data­base IMDb – was hid­den by Mon­day, with the en­tire com­ments sec­tion cen­sored.</p>
    <p>Those re­spon­si­ble for the show have brushed off crit­i­cisms.</p>
    <p>“In­ter­pre­ta­tion is a per­sonal mat­ter,” artis­tic di­rec­tor Bai Yi­cong was quoted as say­ing in lo­cal me­dia last Fri­day.</p>
