    <p>Anx­ious to avoid another lock­down, Euro­pean politi­cians are strug­gling on two fronts. On the one hand, the pub­lic is show­ing in­creas­ing signs of so-called Covid-19 fa­tigue and is ques­tion­ing re­stric­tions. On the other hand, an in­tense de­bate has set in over what po­lit­i­cal sys­tem is best equipped to fight a global dis­ease – a fed­eral or a cen­tralised one.</p>
    <p>In a re­cent sur­vey, the World Health Or­gan­i­sa­tion (WHO) re­ported that mem­ber states across Europe are ex­pe­ri­enc­ing ex­haus­tion over the mea­sures taken to fight the pan­demic, with those who feel this way some­times amount­ing to 60 per cent of their pop­u­la­tions. Al­though this is seen as a nat­u­ral re­ac­tion to the pro­longed na­ture of the cri­sis, “it poses a se­ri­ous threat to ef­forts to con­trol the spread of the virus”, the WHO said.</p>
    <p>“Since the virus ar­rived in the Euro­pean re­gion eight months ago, cit­i­zens have made huge sac­ri­fices to con­tain Covid-19,” WHO re­gional direc­tor for Europe Hans Henri Kluge said ear­lier this month.</p>
    <p>“It has come at an ex­tra­or­di­nary cost, which has ex­hausted all of us, re­gard­less of where we live or what we do. In such cir­cum­stances, it is easy and nat­u­ral to feel ap­a­thetic and de­mo­ti­vated.”</p>
    <p>For Ger­man Chan­cel­lor An­gela Merkel, the ris­ing care­less­ness that re­sults in a higher num­ber of in­fec­tions is a clear warn­ing sign. In her weekly video pod­cast, she strongly urged her com­pa­tri­ots to strictly ob­serve reg­u­la­tions.</p>
    <p>“We must now do ev­ery­thing we can to pre­vent the virus from spread­ing out of con­trol. Ev­ery day counts,” she said.</p>
    <p>Dr Merkel ex­horted: “Please re­frain from any trip, from any cel­e­bra­tion that is not re­ally nec­es­sary. Please stay at home, at your place of res­i­dence, when­ever pos­si­ble.”</p>
    <p>With over 380,000 Covid-19 cases and a death toll un­der 10,000, the sit­u­a­tion in Ger­many may still look good com­pared with that in other Euro­pean Union coun­tries. But the num­bers have picked up alarm­ingly in re­cent weeks.</p>
    <p>Some ex­perts are afraid that in or­der to stop the con­ta­gion, another lock­down has to be im­posed. Given the dam­age al­ready done to the econ­omy, this would be the gov­ern­ment’s last re­sort.</p>
    <p>Other ex­perts be­lieve that the gov­ern­ment is ex­ag­ger­at­ing the threat. “You can­not scare peo­ple all the time,” Dr Klaus Rein­hardt, pres­i­dent of the Ger­man Med­i­cal As­so­ci­a­tion, said in an in­ter­view. “We must learn to deal and live with an in­crease in the num­ber of in­fec­tions.”</p>
    <p>His worry is cri­sis fa­tigue, the up­shot be­ing that some peo­ple might no longer take warn­ings se­ri­ously.</p>
    <p>At the same time, Ger­many’s fed­eral struc­ture has made it in­creas­ingly com­pli­cated to achieve na­tion­wide agree­ment on mea­sures.</p>
    <p>When lo­cal gov­ern­ments of the Lan­der – states within the Ger­man fed­er­a­tion – de­cided early this month to ban overnight stays in ho­tels for trav­ellers from re­gions and ci­ties with high in­fec­tion rates, wide­spread anger erupted.</p>
    <p>For in­stance, af­ter Ber­lin was de­clared a coron­avirus hot spot, Ber­lin­ers were not al­lowed to check into ho­tels in Bavaria, Baden-Wurt­tem­berg or even neigh­bour­ing Bran­den­burg. Con­versely, Ber­lin had a much more le­nient pol­icy and was still wel­com­ing trav­ellers from other re­gions, even high-risk ar­eas.</p>
    <p>As a highly de­cen­tralised repub­lic, the 16 Ger­man states en­joy great au­ton­omy. Al­though the le­gal ba­sis for the mea­sures against the pan­demic is the fed­eral in­fec­tion pro­tec­tion law, the ac­tual im­ple­men­ta­tion comes un­der the re­gional states.</p>
    <p>In fre­quent meet­ings, Dr Merkel has been try­ing to get the heads of the lo­cal gov­ern­ments on board to avoid a hodge­podge of reg­u­la­tions.</p>
    <p>This, how­ever, has not al­ways been suc­cess­ful. When she asked the prime min­is­ters of the states to agree to a joint re­sponse to the re­cent in­crease of in­fec­tions, the Lan­der re­fused be­cause of di­verg­ing risk as­sess­ments. In the end, some went for harsh re­stric­tions, while others were more per­mis­sive, lead­ing to great con­fu­sion among the peo­ple.</p>
    <p>The per­ceived dis­par­ity in rights did not go down well ei­ther.</p>
    <p>Ho­tels, restau­rants and pri­vate cit­i­zens took to the courts and filed law­suits against lo­cal gov­ern­ments.</p>
    <p>In many in­stances, re­gional courts ruled mea­sures like the ban­ning of overnight stays as dis­pro­por­tion­ate and sus­pended them. Bran­den­burg, for ex­am­ple, was forced late last week to re­peal the ban and al­low Ber­lin­ers and others into the re­gion. The same hap­pened this week in the Baltic Sea area, a ma­jor tourist des­ti­na­tion.</p>
    <p>The city ad­min­is­tra­tion of Ber­lin it­self suf­fered a set­back when an ear­lier im­posed cur­few of 11pm to 6am for bars and restau­rants was over­turned by a court a few days ago.</p>
    <p>The 17 au­ton­o­mous re­gions of de­cen­tralised Spain are also worlds apart from form­ing a strat­egy in line with the cen­tral gov­ern­ment in Madrid. In Cat­alo­nia, bars and restau­rants had to com­pletely shut down last week; how­ever, they stay open in Madrid, where the in­fec­tion rate is much higher.</p>
    <p>Over in France, af­ter Covid-19 num­bers sky­rock­eted, Pres­i­dent Em­manuel Macron last week took coun­ter­mea­sures into his own hands and dic­tated new re­stric­tions, such as a night-time cur­few on nine ci­ties, in­clud­ing Paris.</p>
    <p>Just this sum­mer, he had hailed Ger­many’s fed­eral struc­ture for its flex­i­bil­ity, af­ter the time-con­sum­ing re­port­ing sys­tem through Paris laid open the weak­nesses of the cen­tralised French health sys­tem.</p>
    <p>Now, Mr Macron is afraid of some­thing even more threat­en­ing. French hos­pi­tals are al­ready at their lim­its and are ill pre­pared to cope with a sec­ond wave.</p>
