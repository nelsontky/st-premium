    <p>It seems even a pan­demic can­not stop the fever for fes­tive shop­ping.</p>
    <p>Peo­ple still throng Or­chard Road malls these days, queue­ing in long lines to scan Safe En­try codes out­side bou­tiques or pa­tiently wait­ing to have pur­chases wrapped.</p>
    <p>Christ­mas gift­ing is alive and well, even as purse strings are tight­ened in other ar­eas.</p>
    <p>What has changed is how peo­ple give.</p>
    <p>This year, gone are the big-group gift ex­changes and spi­der-webbed Se­cret San­tas. The lack of of­fice par­ties has also taken cor­po­rate gift­ing down a notch.</p>
    <p>‘Tis the sea­son of so­cially dis­tanced present-giv­ing, and as friends and fam­i­lies adapt to re­stric­tions, new trends such as re­mote gift­ing and cosier un­wrap­ping cer­e­monies have emerged.</p>
    <p>The cir­cuit breaker, say re­tail­ers, played a big role in shap­ing gift­ing and shop­ping habits.</p>
    <p>For one thing, the on­line mar­ket­place has taken up a larger chunk of this year’s pie as more con­sumers got used to shop­ping on­line.</p>
    <p>At multi-la­bel beauty re­tailer Es­cen­tials, owned by fragrance and cos­met­ics dis­trib­u­tor Lux­a­sia, on­line sales reached an all-time high of 60 per cent and have con­tin­ued at high vol­umes even as con­sumers re­turn to its three stores, a spokesman says.</p>
    <p>COVID-19-ERA GIV­ING</p>
    <p>Two months or more apart from loved ones also sharp­ened shop­pers’ savvy in send­ing presents and care pack­ages.</p>
    <p>Lo­cal on­line gift­ing plat­form Happy Bunch (hap­py­bunch.com. sg) saw its cus­tomis­able gift boxes called Build A Box, in­tro­duced dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker, fly off the vir­tual shelves.</p>
    <p>Avail­able at a base price of $15, the boxes can be filled with as­sorted food, health and beauty prod­ucts from lo­cal brands, af­ter which cus­tomers can add a mes­sage and have it sent di­rectly to the re­cip­i­ent.</p>
    <p>Di­rec­tor and coun­try man­ager Min­nie Bui says Covid-19 was a “piv­otal mo­ment”, with a spike in care pack­ages be­ing sent to cheer loved ones up.</p>
    <p>She also saw a rise in re­mote birth­day presents, gifts sent in lieu of can­celled wed­dings and more over­seas or­ders to re­cip­i­ents in Sin­ga­pore from part­ners or fam­i­lies sep­a­rated by bor­der re­stric­tions.</p>
    <p>“What we no­ticed was that peo­ple want a cu­rated se­lec­tion of lo­cal, trusted brands – with the flex­i­bil­ity and con­ve­nience of choos­ing from mul­ti­ple brands in one space,” she adds.</p>
    <p>“With the move­ment re­stric­tions, gift­ing was one way for peo­ple to be there with­out phys­i­cally be­ing there.”</p>
    <p>Like­wise, beauty re­tailer Sephora has ob­served a new trend in dis­tance gift­ing, even lo­cally. In the last year, about 65 per cent of or­ders that in­cluded a gift box were ad­dressed to a re­cip­i­ent who was not the pur­chaser.</p>
    <p>“As a re­sult of so­cial dis­tanc­ing and cir­cuit breaker mea­sures, our cus­tomers are get­ting more savvy at sur­pris­ing their friends and fam­ily with small to­kens of af­fec­tion with­out even l eav­ing their house,” says a spokesman.</p>
    <p>Sephora also en­ables cross­bor­der gift card-buy­ing so cus­tomers can buy gift cards for friends abroad via the coun­try’s site do­main – for ex­am­ple us­ing sephora.my to buy for friends in Malaysia.</p>
    <p>They can also add per­son­alised video mes­sages to their gifts.</p>
    <p>Should peo­ple still step i nto stores these days, it is no longer for aim­less brows­ing but with “high in­tent”, adds the spokesman.</p>
    <p>“Those who visit our stores know what they want – they use our mo­bile app to build their shop­ping lists, book vir­tual con­sul­ta­tions and opt for our click-and-re­serve What­sApp ser­vice to en­sure their prod­ucts are ready for them at the store.”</p>
    <p>BIG­GER, BET­TER GIFTS</p>
    <p>The year of so­cial dis­tanc­ing and work­ing from home has also had an ef­fect on the type and size of gifts bought.</p>
    <p>Curbs on group sizes have helped nat­u­rally cull friend lists. With many still work­ing from home, large-scale of­fice Se­cret San­tas are now dead and along with them the de­mand for off­hand pur­chases.</p>
    <p>With­out the need for small, po­lite gifts for col­leagues or in­signif­i­cant oth­ers, some are buy­ing big­ger and bet­ter for those who do mat­ter.</p>
    <p>Real es­tate agent Windy Chan used to buy 40 to 50 Christ­mas gifts in the past – spend­ing up to a few hun­dred dol­lars – but has nar­rowed her list down to just 20 this year.</p>
    <p>“I used to buy generic stock­ing fillers like choco­lates, hand washes and those hand creams that come with three in a tube. I had these on standby in case I had guests vis­it­ing, or to pass to col­leagues or clients when I see them,” says Ms Chan, 41.</p>
    <p>“This year, I did away with all of that be­cause I won’t be meet­ing as many peo­ple, such as for­mer class­mates. I’ve spent more on in­di­vid­ual Christ­mas gifts this year, maybe be­cause I cut away the generic gifts and have more money to spend on fam­ily and close friends.”</p>
    <p>In­deed, gift giv­ing has be­come more in­ten­tional, note re­tail­ers.</p>
    <p>Happy Bunch’s most pop­u­lar items for its gift boxes in­clude “thought­ful” picks such as hand sani­tiser, fab­ric masks, pam­per­ing prod­ucts like clay masks and can­dles, and healthy snacks.</p>
    <p>“Peo­ple want – and will con­tinue to get – things that are prac­ti­cal and rel­e­vant to their life­style at the mo­ment,” says Ms Bui. “They look for items use­ful to the re­ceiver.”</p>
    <p>Re­tail­ers also ob­served more shop­pers buy­ing pre­mium or bigticket items.</p>
    <p>Lux­a­sia re­gional man­ag­ing di­rec­tor Karen Ong has no­ticed “peo­ple be­ing a lot more will­ing to trade up the l ux­ury scale for higher-end brands, and buy­ing higher-priced items”.</p>
    <p>She reck­ons it may have to do with shop­pers redi­rect­ing their travel bud­get.</p>
    <p>She says: “With many con­sumers un­able to travel, they tend to chan­nel some of their spend­ing to­wards the finer things in life.</p>
    <p>“In­stead of ex­pe­ri­enc­ing dif­fer­ent coun­tries, they fo­cus on shar­ing l ux­ury brands, mem­o­rable shop­ping ex­pe­ri­ences and ex­plor­ing new prod­ucts in their home coun­try.</p>
    <p>“This year has also taught us to look be­yond spend­ing on our­selves, to spend­ing on oth­ers and lift­ing their mood.”</p>
    <p>A LIT­TLE SOME­THING FOR MY­SELF</p>
    <p>More are treat­ing them­selves too.</p>
    <p>Lux­ury e-tailer Net-a-porter ob­serves more shop­pers in the re­gion cart­ing out fine jew­ellery and watches this year, “due to cus­tomers pur­chas­ing more longterm in­vest­ments”.</p>
    <p>Se­nior fash­ion ed­i­tor Libby Page says: “Lux­ury bags were the big­gest sur­prise to us, as cus­tomers used this time to in­vest in their ‘for­ever bag’ from brands such as Bot­tega Veneta, Gucci and Saint Lau­rent.”</p>
    <p>Also pop­u­lar were jew­ellery with “mean­ing and her­itage”, such as zo­diac signs and evil eyes.</p>
    <p>“Our cus­tomers love any­thing with added rel­e­vance and mean­ing. Ev­ery­one knows his or her star sign and car­ry­ing it with you feels spe­cial and sig­nif­i­cant.”</p>
    <p>Ms Page pre­dicts that gift­ing this year “will be cen­tred on mood rather than oc­ca­sion”.</p>
    <p>“We’ve learnt from the past eight months that per­sonal con­nec­tions, even far, will give us strength to get through un­cer­tainty.</p>
    <p>“Re­tail­ers must find a way to evoke these emo­tions in bring­ing to­gether a group of in­di­vid­u­als and the spe­cial gifts that keep them feel­ing con­nected,” she says.</p>
    <p>For Ms Chan, her in­ner cir­cle will be re­ceiv­ing spe­cially cho­sen gifts – an “up­mar­ket” wa­ter bot­tle for some­one who al­ways car­ries one with her; and suit­able skin­care for an­other with sen­si­tive skin.</p>
    <p>She adds: “Dur­ing this pan­demic, I found my­self be­com­ing more at­ten­tive to the peo­ple around me and ask­ing my­self what they would re­ally need.</p>
    <p>“Maybe it’s be­cause we can­not take the time we have to­gether for granted any­more.”</p>
    <p>With many con­sumers un­able to travel, they tend to chan­nel some of their spend­ing to­wards the finer things in life. In­stead of ex­pe­ri­enc­ing dif­fer­ent coun­tries, they fo­cus on shar­ing lux­ury brands, mem­o­rable shop­ping ex­pe­ri­ences and ex­plor­ing new prod­ucts in their home coun­try. ’’</p>
    <p>MS KAREN ONG, re­gional man­ag­ing di­rec­tor of Lux­a­sia, who reck­ons shop­pers may be redi­rect­ing their travel bud­get to­wards more pre­mium gifts for them­selves and oth­ers</p>
