    <p>LON­DON When Phil Fo­den was axed from the Eng­land squad ear­lier this month, to­gether with Manch­ester United striker Ma­son Green­wood, for invit­ing women back to their ho­tel, Pep Guardi­ola de­fended his mid­fielder.</p>
    <p>The Manch­ester City boss said that “Phil knows he made a mis­take, I am pretty sure he is go­ing to make a good sea­son”.</p>
    <p>The Spa­niard is right so far. On the ev­i­dence of Mon­day’s dis­play, he la­belled Fo­den as “in­cred­i­ble” af­ter the 20-year-old in­spired City to start their Premier League ti­tle chal­lenge with a 3-1 win against Wolver­hamp­ton Wan­der­ers.</p>
    <p>City’s de­layed start to the cam­paign – due to their in­volve­ment in last sea­son’s Cham­pi­ons League – had al­lowed Liver­pool to build a six-point lead be­fore they had even kicked a ball.</p>
    <p>Guardi­ola’s side could not af­ford to slip up at the Mo­lineux if they wanted to keep pace with the cham­pi­ons.</p>
    <p>And they raced into a two-goal lead be­fore half-time thanks to Kevin de Bruyne’s penalty and Fo­den’s cool fin­ish.</p>
    <p>City’s swag­ger­ing start gave way to an anx­ious spell as Wolves dom­i­nated af­ter the break and they had to cling on af­ter Raul Jimenez got one back be­fore Gabriel Je­sus sealed the points in stop­page time.</p>
    <p>Fo­den’s goal was a wel­come boost in his first match since he was sent home in dis­grace. The breach of coro­n­avirus pro­to­cols af­ter Eng­land’s Na­tions League match in Ice­land was pub­licly con­demned by City, but Fo­den re­tains Guardi­ola’s trust.</p>
    <p>“For the goal and in the sec­ond half, Fo­den played in­cred­i­bly well, he helped us keep the ball,” Guardi­ola said.</p>
    <p>“He has a big im­pact and makes great con­tri­bu­tions to the team. To­day was not an ex­cep­tion.”</p>
    <p>While City equalled As­ton Villa’s record of win­ning 10 con­sec­u­tive open­ing fix­tures to a top-flight sea­son, there is lit­tle doubt Liver­pool re­main the Premier League’s pre­em­i­nent force.</p>
    <p>But Guardi­ola was de­lighted to open with a vic­tory given the shorter than usual pre-sea­son.</p>
    <p>“We could not run much be­cause we are tired in our legs but in gen­eral we did a good game,” he said.</p>
    <p>“The sit­u­a­tion that we had this last two weeks, I ex­pected some mo­ments where we suf­fer but in gen­eral we con­trolled it well.</p>
    <p>“It was a good per­for­mance. Some­times we need more time to get to our best con­di­tion but it was a good start to come here and win.”</p>
    <p>It feels like a cru­cial sea­son for City as they look to re­gain the ti­tle they won in 2018 and 2019.</p>
    <p>Af­ter fin­ish­ing 18 points be­hind Liver­pool and suf­fer­ing a shock Cham­pi­ons League quar­ter-fi­nal de­feat by Lyon, City need to push Liver­pool harder this term and the early signs were en­cour­ag­ing.</p>
    <p>It was de Bruyne, show­ing no</p>
    <p>signs of re­lax­ing af­ter be­ing voted PFA Player of the Year last sea­son, who took the re­spon­si­bil­ity of driv­ing City for­ward and win­ning the penalty that he con­verted with ease.</p>
    <p>City were beaten by Wolves home and away last sea­son, but this was Guardi­ola’s team at their im­pe­ri­ous best and they struck again with a slick move in the 32nd minute fin­ished off by Fo­den slot­ting home from close range.</p>
    <p>To­tally out­classed in the first half, Wolves were much im­proved af­ter the break be­fore Je­sus’ strike.</p>
    <p>Guardi­ola also con­firmed that he will draft in play­ers from the youth</p>
    <p>academy for to­mor­row’s League Cup third-round match at home against Bournemout­h.</p>
    <p>“With the lack of prepa­ra­tion and seven play­ers out, we have to keep the play­ers who played to­day as fresh as pos­si­ble,” he said.</p>
    <p>City were with­out sev­eral key play­ers at Wolves, with Ilkay Gun­do­gan miss­ing af­ter test­ing pos­i­tive for Covid-19 and Ser­gio Aguero and Aymeric La­porte ruled out in ad­vance with in­juries.</p>
    <p>Bernardo Silva, Joao Cancelo, Olek­sandr Zinchenko and Eric Gar­cia were also side­lined af­ter pick­ing up in­juries in train­ing.</p>
