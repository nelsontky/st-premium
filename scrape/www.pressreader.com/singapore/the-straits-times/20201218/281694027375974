    <p>Madam Muthuletch­mi, who has been sell­ing South In­dian food as a hawker for 27 years, said hawker cul­ture’s in­scrip­tion on the Unesco in­tan­gi­ble cul­tural her­itage list made her feel seen.</p>
    <p>On some days, the 59-year-old said, the daily trans­ac­tions are so quick and im­per­sonal that they can make her feel taken for granted.</p>
    <p>“I get tired or worn out be­cause it’s very hard, very hot, and when you are young, you have more en­ergy,” she said. “I wanted to give (it) up, then my son stepped in.”</p>
    <p>She ini­tially did not want her son to fol­low in her foot­steps as a hawker, be­cause of the gru­elling hours, but was con­vinced by his pas­sion for the job.</p>
    <p>The Unesco achieve­ment sets her mind at ease, now that hawker cul­ture here has gar­nered in­ter­na­tional pres­tige.</p>
    <p>A day af­ter Sin­ga­pore’s three­year bid for hawker cul­ture to be in­scribed on the Unesco list fi­nally came to fruition, hawk­ers ex­pressed their hope that it will trans­late into con­crete re­sults, at­tract­ing tourists af­ter the pan­demic and more young peo­ple into the trade.</p>
    <p>Prime Min­is­ter Lee Hsien Loong, in a Face­book post on Wed­nes­day night, had thanked them for “nour­ish­ing a na­tion’s stom­ach and spir­its”, and for their “sweat, toil and ded­i­ca­tion to their pro­fes­sion”.</p>
    <p>In the na­tion’s early history, hawk­ers sold af­ford­able food out of push­carts, go­ing from al­ley to al­ley to ped­dle their fare. Later, the au­thor­i­ties built hawker cen­tres, and the rest, af­ter Wed­nes­day’s mo­men­tous de­ci­sion, is history.</p>
    <p>Ms Amber Pong, 30, is one of a gen­er­a­tion of young hawk­ers who have en­tered the trade for its mer­its, in spite of the trop­i­cal heat and long days.</p>
    <p>The for­mer mar­ket­ing ex­ec­u­tive said she had al­ways wanted to be a hawker, even leav­ing her job to go to Aus­tralia to work as a pas­try chef in Mel­bourne to gain ex­pe­ri­ence be­fore fi­nally set­ting up her stall in Jan­uary.</p>
    <p>She sells cakes at Ghim Moh food cen­tre and said she chose to open a hawker stall rather than a bak­ery or cafe be­cause she en­joys meet­ing peo­ple of all ages and eth­nic­i­ties.</p>
    <p>“Why did I want to be a hawker? I grew up vis­it­ing hawker cen­tres at least three times a week and felt very com­fort­able. Hav­ing my stall in a hawker cen­tre makes it very ac­ces­si­ble, so all kinds of peo­ple can buy my cakes,” she said.</p>
    <p>As a show of ap­pre­ci­a­tion, about 6,000 hawk­ers in more than 110 hawker cen­tres across Sin­ga­pore will, in the com­ing weeks, re­ceive a la­bel in­di­cat­ing their new Unesco in­tan­gi­ble cul­tural her­itage sta­tus.</p>
    <p>They will be able to stick the la­bel on their stall fronts as a stamp of recog­ni­tion, although some hawk­ers, like fish­ball noo­dle hawker Tom Loo, 35, are more prag­matic.</p>
    <p>He said hawk­ers are more pre­oc­cu­pied daily with pay­ing the rent and taxes, and said the best way to keep hawk­ers in busi­ness is to make sure costs re­main low, as even a small in­crease can hurt them, es­pe­cially when these can­not be passed on to con­sumers.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­porean food critic K.F. See­toh pointed out that other stake­hold­ers will now have to ac­tively lever­age the Unesco recog­ni­tion to make it count for hawk­ers.</p>
    <p>He said those in­volved will have to look at new pos­si­bil­i­ties in trade, tourism, ed­u­ca­tion, as well as a hawk­ers’ mu­seum and food fes­ti­val that both Sin­ga­pore­ans and vis­i­tors can con­nect with.</p>
    <p>“When the air­port doors re­open, the world will come hun­gry, and with a vengeance... It’s no longer just about what and where to eat but also what are the sto­ries and op­por­tu­ni­ties be­hind this makan cul­ture,” he said.</p>
