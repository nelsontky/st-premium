    <p>An over­whelm­ing ma­jor­ity of around 95 per cent of Sin­ga­pore res­i­dents are keen on laws and en­force­ment when it comes to public hy­giene in places such as child­care cen­tres, eater­ies and malls.</p>
    <p>The third edi­tion of the Public Clean­li­ness Sat­is­fac­tion Sur­vey, con­ducted by the Sin­ga­pore Man­age­ment Univer­sity (SMU), polled 1,716 Sin­ga­pore­ans and per­ma­nent res­i­dents aged 21 and above.</p>
    <p>The re­sults were re­leased yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The sur­vey, based on re­sponses col­lected from last De­cem­ber to April, be­fore the start of the cir­cuit breaker, asked res­i­dents about their per­cep­tions of public clean­li­ness and hy­giene in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>While main­tain­ing public clean­li­ness in­volves re­mov­ing dirt or lit­ter from public spa­ces, main­tain­ing public hy­giene goes a notch higher and in­volves dis­in­fect­ing public spa­ces to kill germs and min­imise the spread of in­fec­tious dis­eases.</p>
    <p>The ma­jor­ity of the peo­ple polled were con­cerned about the level of hy­giene in public places.</p>
    <p>About 97 per cent of them agreed that there should be laws to re­quire stricter hy­giene stan­dards for shared spa­ces such as child­care cen­tres, el­der­care fa­cil­i­ties, schools, food es­tab­lish­ments and shop­ping cen­tres.</p>
    <p>Re­spon­dents also wanted build­ing op­er­a­tors to be made re­spon­si­ble for the public hy­giene of their build­ings.</p>
    <p>When it came to public clean­li­ness, about 93 per cent of re­spon­dents in­di­cated that they were sat­is­fied with the clean­li­ness of public spa­ces they re­cently vis­ited.</p>
    <p>This was a 9 per cent hike from 2018.</p>
    <p>Both Pro­fes­sor Paulin Tay Straughan, SMU’s dean of stu­dents and pro­fes­sor of so­ci­ol­ogy (prac­tice), and Dr Mathew Mathews, se­nior re­search fel­low at the In­sti­tute of Pol­icy Stud­ies at the Na­tional Univer­sity of Sin­ga­pore, who led the sur­vey to­gether, agreed that the ramp­ing up of clean­ing ef­forts due to the Covid-19 pan­demic may have led to the in­crease in sat­is­fac­tion lev­els.</p>
    <p>Prof Straughan said: “We see all the neg­a­tive ef­fects of Covid-19 but it has also opened op­por­tu­ni­ties for us to do things that we might not nor­mally have done with ur­gency. Care­ful at­ten­tion to public hy­giene is some­thing that is ap­pro­pri­ate at this time.</p>
    <p>“I do think if we take ad­van­tage of the op­por­tu­ni­ties that we have now, we might have a higher chance of chang­ing be­hav­iour in a sus­tain­able way.”</p>
    <p>De­spite the over­all sat­is­fac­tion, 23 per cent of re­spon­dents said that the thor­ough­ness of the clean­ing in hawker cen­tres and cof­fee shops was still in­suf­fi­cient.</p>
    <p>When it came to re­turn­ing trays in food and bev­er­age es­tab­lish­ments, 36 per cent of re­spon­dents said they were un­sure if trays should be re­turned.</p>
    <p>About the same num­ber of re­spon­dents ex­pected clean­ers to re­turn the trays in­stead.</p>
    <p>The re­sults of the sur­vey threw light on Sin­ga­pore’s re­liance on clean­ing ser­vices to en­sure the clean­li­ness of sur­round­ings.</p>
    <p>In­deed, 87 per cent of re­spon­dents ac­knowl­edged that Sin­ga­pore is clean only be­cause of the ef­fi­ciency of its clean­ing ser­vices.</p>
    <p>Less than half of the re­spon­dents in­di­cated that they would vol­un­teer in a neigh­bour­hood group that cham­pi­oned clean­li­ness mat­ters.</p>
    <p>Fi­nan­cial tech­nol­ogy ex­ec­u­tive Sarthak Shreya, 26, who lives near the Civic District, noted that peo­ple have been mind­ful in public spa­ces in re­cent months.</p>
    <p>“I no­tice peo­ple are care­ful about their ac­tions in public be­cause of Covid-19. They want to make sure they and those around them are not at risk.</p>
    <p>“If we main­tain the same level of hy­giene even af­ter this pan­demic, it can help the com­mu­nity build re­silience against fu­ture threats,” he said.</p>
    <p>The study went on to sug­gest some ways the public could im­prove public clean­li­ness and hy­giene.</p>
    <p>For ex­am­ple, it sug­gested that clean­ers in food and bev­er­age out­lets could put in less ac­tive ef­fort to clear trays, which would send a strong mes­sage that it is the pa­trons’ duty to re­turn trays.</p>
    <p>It also sug­gested that the Gov­ern­ment could con­sider how build­ing op­er­a­tors can be ac­count­able for and trans­par­ent about public hy­giene mat­ters.</p>
