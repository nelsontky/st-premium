    <p>Ms Su­varna Oom­men tested neg­a­tive for Covid-19 on Oct 19 af­ter a bout with the disease. But the 48-year-old feels she is yet to re­cover. Crip­pling fa­tigue, in­som­nia and a lin­ger­ing lung in­jury from a bout of pneu­mo­nia brought on by the coro­n­avirus still haunt her.</p>
    <p>“I feel help­less as I am nowhere near as ac­tive as be­fore, even anx­ious whether my lungs will heal fully,” she told The Straits Times.</p>
    <p>Ms Oom­men, who lives in Tri­van­drum, has also been di­ag­nosed with de­pres­sion af­ter bat­tling the virus for more than a fort­night. This de­spair was ag­gra­vated by the deaths of other pa­tients she saw in the in­ten­sive care unit and pro­longed iso­la­tion from her loved ones.</p>
    <p>In a coun­try with the sec­ond­high­est caseload of Covid-19, pro­vid­ing ded­i­cated af­ter­care has be­come a pri­or­ity. Many hos­pi­tals across In­dia have set up post-Covid clin­ics to of­fer wide-rang­ing and long-drawn-out care that “long Covid” pa­tients need. West Ben­gal state even re­leased guide­lines last Wed­nes­day, rec­om­mend­ing fol­low-up care last­ing as long as a year in some cases for what it de­scribed as a “multi-sys­tem disease”.</p>
    <p>The post-Covid clinic at Delhi’s Ra­jiv Gandhi Su­per Spe­cial­ity Hospi­tal, launched in Au­gust and equipped with ex­perts such as neuro-spe­cial­ists and res­pi­ra­tory con­sul­tants, has han­dled more than 600 pa­tients.</p>
    <p>Dr Ajeet Jain, a car­di­ol­o­gist and nodal of­fi­cer at the clinic, said it was set up af­ter many pa­tients who had re­cov­ered at the hospi­tal com­plained of in­ad­e­quate af­ter­care at other hos­pi­tals where they were re­ferred to. He said In­dia needs to set up more of such clin­ics with spe­cial­ists who have a bet­ter un­der­stand­ing of the ill­ness, in­clud­ing on the role of an­ti­bod­ies in caus­ing “long Covid”.</p>
    <p>A re­cent Yale Univer­sity study said Covid-19 pa­tients re­ported dra­matic in­creases in auto-an­ti­body re­ac­tiv­i­ties that tar­geted or­gans, tis­sues and the im­mune sys­tem, rather than fight­ing off the in­vad­ing virus. “Be­cause an­ti­bod­ies can per­sist for a long time, it’s con­ceiv­able that they may con­trib­ute to the de­vel­op­ment of long-Covid dis­eases,” Dr Aaron Ring, an im­muno­bi­ol­o­gist at Yale and the study’s se­nior au­thor, told The Guardian.</p>
    <p>While young pa­tients be­low the age of 40 formed the ma­jor­ity of the clinic’s ini­tial pa­tients, this mix is now dom­i­nated by those above 60. This means the prob­lems it faces have ex­panded from neu­ropsy­chi­a­try ones, such as fa­tigue or stress, to ag­gra­vated forms of chronic ill­nesses com­mon among the aged such as di­a­betes, and car­diac and lung ail­ments.</p>
    <p>Dr Jain said pa­tients with pre-ex­ist­ing car­diac ill­nesses re­ported ag­gra­vated symp­toms even af­ter test­ing neg­a­tive for Covid-19. They feel breath­less or weak walk­ing 200m or 300m, or climb­ing one flight of steps, com­pared with 500m or two flights of steps pre­vi­ously.</p>
    <p>A re­view ar­ti­cle in Lung In­dia last month also warned that postCovid lung fi­bro­sis – where lung tis­sue be­comes stiff and scarred – could be the “tsunami that will fol­low the earth­quake”. It said about 10 per cent of pa­tients glob­ally will de­velop se­vere Covid-19 pneu­mo­nia and 5 per cent will de­velop acute res­pi­ra­tory dis­tress syn­drome. While most will re­cover with­out resid­ual lung dam­age, it is likely a “size­able num­ber” will be left with fi­bro­sis or other se­vere pul­monary com­pli­ca­tions.</p>
    <p>One of its three au­thors, Dr Zarir Farokh Ud­wa­dia, a con­sul­tant physi­cian with Hin­duja Hospi­tal and Breach Candy Hospi­tal in Mum­bai, said pa­tients with more se­vere ini­tial lung in­volve­ment and dam­age must be fol­lowed up “ex­tra care­fully and mon­i­tored”.</p>
    <p>Dr Ravin­dra Me­hta, a con­sul­tant pul­mo­nolo­gist with Apollo Hos­pi­tals in Ban­ga­lore, has seen “at least 50 to 70 cases” of lung fi­bro­sis at two post-Covid clin­ics launched in Oc­to­ber. But he said most are get­ting bet­ter with fol­low-up care.</p>
    <p>“Our un­der­stand­ing of the worst ex­tent of this prob­lem is cur­rently based on West­ern data, but it looks like it will not be that bad in the In­dian co­hort. We, how­ever, need con­crete data (in the In­dian con­text) to see whether na­ture will re­solve it en­tirely or a small per­cent­age will need drugs,” he said.</p>
    <p>Last month, a post-Covid clinic opened at the Gov­ern­ment Multi Spe­cial­ity Hospi­tal in Chandi­garh. It re­ceives around eight pa­tients daily with con­cerns such as per­sis­tent cough, myal­gia and stress-re­lated dis­or­ders.</p>
    <p>Dr Aman­deep Kang, di­rec­tor of health ser­vices at the Chandi­garh Ad­min­is­tra­tion, said even those with “mild to mod­er­ate” con­cerns are ad­versely af­fected, such as by the trauma of po­ten­tially trans­mit­ting the virus to their loved ones. “All these is­sues are there... Peo­ple need sup­port later on,” she added.</p>
    <p>Be­cause an­ti­bod­ies can per­sist for a long time, it’s con­ceiv­able that they may con­trib­ute to the de­vel­op­ment of long-Covid dis­eases.</p>
