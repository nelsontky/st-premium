    <p>Once a school dropout and gang mem­ber, 42-year-old An­drew Ong has been be­hind bars twice.</p>
    <p>The first sen­tence of nine months in 1996 was for ri­ot­ing when he was only 18. The se­cond, in 1999, saw him spend two weeks in army de­ten­tion for in­sub­or­di­na­tion while he was a re­servist.</p>
    <p>For years, Mr Ong was ad­dicted to vices, in­clud­ing drugs and al­co­hol, but he turned his life around and has been help­ing for­mer of­fend­ers rein­te­grate into society.</p>
    <p>For his con­tri­bu­tions, he won the an­nual Silent Heroes Award in the Out­stand­ing Adult cat­e­gory.</p>
    <p>Min­is­ter for So­cial and Fam­ily Devel­op­ment Masagos Zulkifli gave out the awards to the win­ners yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>A to­tal of 91 sub­mis­sions were re­ceived, of which 13 be­came fi­nal­ists be­fore five were se­lected for their out­stand­ing con­tri­bu­tions.</p>
    <p>Mr Ong told The Sun­day Times: “Grow­ing up, I was ei­ther stand­ing out­side of my class or out­side a</p>
    <p>Crim­i­nal In­ves­ti­ga­tion Depart­ment room.</p>
    <p>“To­day I’m hon­oured to be recog­nised for be­ing a pos­i­tive ex­am­ple. I hope to in­spire fel­low ex-of­fend­ers and show them that it is pos­si­ble to turn their lives around.”</p>
    <p>Mr Ong re­alised it was time to clean up his act af­ter he over­dosed on ke­tamine when he was 22 in 2000, caus­ing him to lose a busi­ness con­tract while he was work­ing at a night­club.</p>
    <p>He re­turned to school in 2002 as a pri­vate O-level can­di­date and, in 2007, com­pleted a de­gree in com­mu­ni­ca­tions man­age­ment at Aus­tralia’s Edith Cowan Univer­sity.</p>
    <p>Since then, he has been in mar­ket­ing, com­mu­ni­ca­tions, ad­ver­tis­ing and busi­ness devel­op­ment in the pub­lic and pri­vate sec­tors.</p>
    <p>With a de­sire to help for­mer of­fend­ers re­build their lives, Mr Ong joined so­cial en­ter­prise Em­pact in 2018 as head of cor­po­rate part­ner­ships and mar­ket­ing. It has be­come his life mis­sion to change the neg­a­tive per­cep­tion the pub­lic has of for­mer of­fend­ers as well as build a strong sup­port sys­tem for them.</p>
    <p>He is an ac­tive vol­un­teer with so­cial or­gan­i­sa­tions like Ar­chi­tects Of Life, a so­cial en­ter­prise that de­vel­ops the po­ten­tial of youth-atrisk and for­mer of­fend­ers.</p>
    <p>Mr Ong is also the co-founder of Break the Cy­cle, which uses cy­cling as a way of con­nect­ing and sup­port­ing for­mer of­fend­ers to­wards rein­te­gra­tion into society.</p>
    <p>He also co-founded Chance, an agency that trains and hires for­mer of­fend­ers for the cre­ative in­dus­try.</p>
    <p>AWARD FOR EV­ERY­DAY HEROES</p>
    <p>Inau­gu­rated in 2014, the award recog­nises ev­ery­day Sin­ga­pore­ans and per­ma­nent res­i­dents who are qui­etly mak­ing a dif­fer­ence with­out seek­ing recog­ni­tion.</p>
    <p>Dr Julian Hong, a for­mer board ad­viser with Ar­chi­tects Of Life, said: “An­drew is liv­ing tes­ti­mony of his jour­ney from stereo­types – some­one with lived ex­pe­ri­ence of gangs and in­car­cer­a­tion, to now do­ing good and help­ing oth­ers.”</p>
    <p>Mr M. P. Sel­lvem, pres­i­dent of the Civil­ians As­so­ci­a­tion and chair­man of the Silent Heroes Move­ment, said: “Silent Heroes write a one-sided con­tract and in it, it says they will do what­ever they can to make a pos­i­tive im­pact on oth­ers and ex­pect noth­ing in re­turn.”</p>
    <p>In­dian na­tional Dipti Julka, 39, was named the Com­pas­sion­ate For­eigner for her vol­un­teer­ing work at ground-up move­ment Be Kind SG.</p>
    <p>Mr Aaron Yeoh, 42, won the award in the Hearts of Hu­man­ity cat­e­gory for his con­tri­bu­tions in three so­cial or­gan­i­sa­tions.</p>
    <p>Etch Em­path pro­vides skills devel­op­ment work­shops for vis­ually im­paired peo­ple, while For­ti­tude Culina is a cafe Mr Yeoh started that hires vis­ually im­paired peo­ple as chefs, and Cy­cling With­out Age Sin­ga­pore was set up by him to re­duce so­cial iso­la­tion for se­niors.</p>
    <p>The award in the In­spir­ing Youth cat­e­gory went to Mr Derek Lim, 25, for his work as a vol­un­teer with Home­less Hearts of Sin­ga­pore, a non-profit or­gan­i­sa­tion that be­friends and helps home­less peo­ple.</p>
    <p>Mr Mashuthoo Ab­dul Rahi­man, 71, won the Pioneers of Promise cat­e­gory for his work as one of the ini­tia­tors of free tu­ition class in Sin­ga­pore in the 1970s and as an ac­tive leader in sev­eral char­i­ties.</p>
    <p>ROLE MODEL</p>
    <p>Grow­ing up, I was ei­ther stand­ing out­side of my class or out­side a Crim­i­nal In­ves­ti­ga­tion Depart­ment room. To­day I’m hon­oured to be recog­nised for be­ing a pos­i­tive ex­am­ple. I hope to in­spire fel­low ex-of­fend­ers and show them that it is pos­si­ble to turn their lives around.</p>
    <p>MR AN­DREW ONG, win­ner of the an­nual Silent Heroes Award in the Out­stand­ing Adult cat­e­gory, who used to be a gang mem­ber and has been be­hind bars twice.</p>
