    <p>She started out cre­at­ing DIY or­ganic body scrubs and lip balms for young women, but Sin­ga­porean Lynsey Lim soon no­ticed a gap in the mar­ket: clean prod­ucts safe for their lit­tle ones.</p>
    <p>“Cus­tomers who have been with us from the be­gin­ning were re­quest­ing gen­tle nat­u­ral prod­ucts for their chil­dren too,” says the founder of home-grown sk­in­care la­bel Hand­made He­roes, which she started in 2015.</p>
    <p>It took 11/ years of re­search and</p>
    <p>2 de­vel­op­ment be­fore the 31-yearold mother of one launched her first mama and baby prod­ucts last year: Free The Nips Nurs­ing Balm and Soothe That Tooth Di­a­per Balm, both priced at $16.90.</p>
    <p>Made with the same hand­made, all-nat­u­ral mantra the la­bel is known for, the balms are for­mu­lated without com­mon al­ler­gens in ba­bies, such as soya bean oil, beeswax, honey, lano­lin and fra­grances.</p>
    <p>Cal­en­dula flower ex­tract in both prod­ucts soothes and calms cracked, dry and over­worked nip­ples, and itch­ing baby bot­toms. The nurs­ing balm is also made safe for moth­ers to latch their ba­bies for breastfeed­ing di­rectly af­ter ap­pli­ca­tion.</p>
    <p>The prod­ucts have helped Hand­made He­roes gain new cus­tomers through word of mouth i n the mummy com­mu­nity.</p>
    <p>“Our tar­get au­di­ence for the baby line were our ex­ist­ing cus­tomers who were al­ready into clean beauty prod­ucts and who grew with our brand over the last five years,” says Ms Lim.</p>
    <p>Adding baby-ap­pro­pri­ate prod­ucts to the range was also in line with her own jour­ney. Ms Lim, who lives in Kuala Lumpur with her hus­band and their 20-month-old daugh­ter, had been ex­pect­ing for most of 2018 – “so there was def­i­nitely per­sonal mo­ti­va­tion”.</p>
    <p>When pre­par­ing to wel­come her daugh­ter, she found that many baby prod­ucts on the mar­ket were ei­ther heav­ily scented, or con­tained in­gre­di­ents she was not com­fort­able to use on her lit­tle one.</p>
    <p>“In a way, it’s a tes­ta­ment of my love for my daugh­ter, who is the un­sus­pect­ing model on the pack­ag­ing of our di­a­per balm,” she adds.</p>
    <p>Ms Lim moved to KL in 2017, af­ter ex­pand­ing and build­ing the brand’s own pro­duc­tion fa­cil­ity in Malaysia to keep up with de­mand.</p>
    <p>At the GMP (Good Man­u­fac­tur­ing Prac­tice)-cer­ti­fied fa­cil­ity, she can per­son­ally over­see prod­uct test­ing, man­u­fac­tur­ing and qual­ity con­trol from start to fin­ish.</p>
    <p>It also made it pos­si­ble for the brand to quickly for­mu­late and launch a hand sani­tiser in March, when the pan­demic es­ca­lated. The sani­tiser is made with 100 per cent nat­u­ral sug­ar­cane al­co­hol to be “gen­tle and safe on lit­tle hands”.</p>
    <p>The pan­demic did af­fect pro­duc­tion and de­lay time­lines, but the brand is on track to meet­ing sales tar­gets, thanks to its on­line sales pres­ence, says Ms Lim.</p>
    <p>She re­cently launched a baku­chiol booster oil – of­ten touted as a nat­u­ral al­ter­na­tive to anti-age­ing prod­uct retinol and con­sid­ered a rare prod­uct for small brands – af­ter more than a year of de­vel­op­ment.</p>
    <p>She says: “Our cus­tomers ex­pect qual­ity prod­ucts that are not just all-nat­u­ral, but also ef­fec­tive. We are open to lis­ten­ing to them about prod­ucts they want to see from us.</p>
    <p>“Since Covid-19, we’ve come up with care pack­ages – in­clud­ing mama and baby gift sets with es­sen­tials for con­fine­ment, such as dry sham­poo – so that even with so­cial dis­tanc­ing, cus­tomers can still con­tinue gift­ing and cel­e­brat­ing a new baby with fam­ily and friends.”</p>
