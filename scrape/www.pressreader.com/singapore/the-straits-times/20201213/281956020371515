    <p>Back i n 2012, After­shock was started in a small shop­house in Seran­goon Road.</p>
    <p>To­day, it is Sin­ga­pore’s big­gest bou­tique PC builder, oc­cu­py­ing nine units in a light in­dus­trial build­ing in Ben­de­meer and em­ploy­ing about 150 staff.</p>
    <p>The firm has ex­panded its op­er­a­tions to Malaysia and Aus­tralia and has its own show­rooms and pro­duc­tion lines in both coun­tries.</p>
    <p>It is now run by fra­ter­nal twins Mar­cus and Joe Wee, both 36.</p>
    <p>Mr Mar­cus Wee, who is man­ag­ing di­rec­tor, started the com­pany in 2012 with a busi­ness part­ner, but the part­ner ex­ited af­ter a year. Mr Joe Wee, who is cre­ative di­rec­tor, came on board in 2013.</p>
    <p>The com­pany has grown from its be­gin­nings, when it found a niche in the mar­ket by of­fer­ing cus­tomis­able lap­tops and PCs. It now caters to a wider cus­tomer base.</p>
    <p>As After­shock ex­pands over­seas, Sin­ga­pore will not be its big­gest mar­ket for long, said Mr Mar­cus Wee. It is look­ing to ex­pand to two more coun­tries in the next year.</p>
    <p>But things have not al­ways been smooth sail­ing. “Once the firm started em­ploy­ing 60 to 70 staff, man­ag­ing peo­ple was a whole new ball game,” said Mr Mar­cus Wee.</p>
    <p>“I tried to take on a lot of the re­spon­si­bil­ity my­self ear­lier on, think­ing it was bet­ter if I did things my­self in a cer­tain way.</p>
    <p>“But now I feel that I could have in­vested in peo­ple ear­lier. Of­ten, peo­ple can sur­prise you, they might do things in a way that is bet­ter than what you would have done, or in an un­ex­pected way.”</p>
    <p>For their en­trepreneur­ship and putting Sin­ga­pore on the map, the Wee sib­lings are nom­i­nees for this year’s The Straits Times Sin­ga­porean of the Year award.</p>
    <p>After­shock’s prod­ucts have won dozens of awards, such as Best Gam­ing Note­book and Best Com­pact PC, from lead­ing me­dia play­ers such as Hard­wareZone, The Straits Times and Geek Cul­ture.</p>
    <p>Amid the Covid-19 pan­demic, sales have gone up by 30 per cent as more peo­ple work from home and pick up gam­ing.</p>
    <p>The firm prides it­self on its af­ter­sales ser­vice, said Mr Mar­cus Wee.</p>
    <p>“That has been our big­gest sell­ing point since the be­gin­ning. Our vi­sion is that if any­one buys our prod­ucts and needs help, they will get help.”</p>
    <p>This vi­sion also shows in its hir­ing – 50 per cent of the com­pany’s head­count is in­volved in af­ter­sales work.</p>
    <p>De­spite its suc­cess, the com­pany is not rest­ing on its lau­rels.</p>
    <p>“One of the real tri­als for a PC com­pany is to keep go­ing af­ter it reaches a cer­tain scale. As we ex­pand, we have to main­tain sta­bil­ity,” said Mr Mar­cus Wee.</p>
    <p>His ad­vice to other as­pir­ing Sin­ga­porean busi­ness own­ers is to not be afraid to fail. “When you make mis­takes and screw up, that’s how you sort of fig­ure out where the bound­aries are,” he said.</p>
    <p>“It’s very im­por­tant to look at the mar­ket and look for open­ings where there is room to dis­rupt. It’s very com­mon in en­trepreneur­ship for peo­ple to want to do a very generic kind of busi­ness, but you need to look for where you can have a niche ad­van­tage.”</p>
