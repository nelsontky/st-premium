    <p>Sil­i­con Val­ley has poured bil­lions into In­dia since the start of the year, with Face­book and Google lead­ing the charge with in­vest­ments of US$5.7 bil­lion (S$7.9 bil­lion) and US$4.5 bil­lion re­spec­tively.</p>
    <p>Chip­mak­ers Qual­comm and In­tel also struck deals in the coun­try, along with a string of lead­ing United States tech-fo­cused private eq­uity firms. All of th­ese in­vest­ments went to one com­pany: Jio Plat­forms, the tele­com-and-dig­i­tal services arm of bil­lion­aire Mukesh Am­bani’s sprawl­ing en­ergy-to-re­tail con­glom­er­ate Re­liance In­dus­tries, which has in four years grown into In­dia’s largest telecom­mu­ni­ca­tions op­er­a­tor, with 388 mil­lion users.</p>
    <p>With the help of its new in­vestors, Jio now aims to dom­i­nate In­dia’s dig­i­tal econ­omy by mov­ing up the tech­nol­ogy stack with ev­ery­thing from e-com­merce to stream­ing ahead of an ini­tial public of­fer­ing within five years. For Sil­i­con Val­ley, the al­liance with In­dia’s would-be na­tional cham­pion marks its safest foothold yet in the highly promis­ing mar­ket, and comes as of­fi­cials in the coun­try move to curb ri­val in­vest­ment from China.</p>
    <p>“Th­ese com­pa­nies are now bet­ting ag­gres­sively on In­dia, so they don’t find them­selves in a sit­u­a­tion where the mar­ket grows over the next 10 years and they’re out,” said For­rester Re­search an­a­lyst Satish Meena. “They’re buy­ing fu­ture ac­cess.”</p>
    <p>So what ex­actly do the West Coast tech com­pa­nies have planned for In­dia?</p>
    <p>FACE­BOOK</p>
    <p>In­dia is Face­book’s largest mar­ket, with more than 300 mil­lion users, plus 400 mil­lion on What­sApp.</p>
    <p>Since in­vest­ing in Jio in April, the two com­pa­nies have launched a ma­jor e-com­merce ini­tia­tive in the re­gion, in­te­grat­ing Re­liance’s plat­form JioMart into What­sApp to con­nect mil­lions of cus­tomers with lo­cal re­tail­ers sell­ing gro­ceries and es­sen­tials. An­a­lysts say that us­ing What­sApp with JioMart will al­low it to tap the fast-grow­ing mar­ket for on­line trans­ac­tions, a promis­ing new rev­enue stream.</p>
    <p>“There’s al­ways a con­ver­sa­tion on ‘Can the next 300 mil­lion, 400 mil­lion, 500 mil­lion peo­ple come on­line?’ But it’s equally im­por­tant to fo­cus on the other side of the equa­tion... How do we fully un­leash the po­ten­tial by bring­ing the next 60 mil­lion small busi­nesses on­line as well?” said Face­book’s man­ag­ing di­rec­tor for In­dia Ajit Mo­han.</p>
    <p>He added that the move rep­re­sents a fur­ther evo­lu­tion of What­sApp’s grow­ing im­por­tance as a busi­ness tool in the coun­try.</p>
    <p>“For a lot of small busi­nesses, be­ing on­line in In­dia to­day means their num­ber on What­sApp,” he said. “When you walk around... in­vari­ably you start see­ing the sign­board with the What­sApp logo and the num­ber.”</p>
    <p>Cur­rently less than 20 per cent of Face­book’s rev­enues come from the Asia-Pa­cific re­gion, in part be­cause In­dia’s on­line ad­ver­tis­ing mar­ket is com­par­a­tively small.</p>
    <p>The com­pany has also tus­sled with In­dian reg­u­la­tors in the past, who in 2016 blocked its “Free Ba­sics” on­line ac­cess plan, and What­sApp Pay is still yet to se­cure reg­u­la­tory clear­ance.</p>
    <p>Sep­a­rately, What­sApp last week an­nounced plans to branch into in­sur­ance and credit in In­dia, while Face­book this month launched In­sta­gram Reels, a short-video com­peti­tor to the wildly pop­u­lar Chi­nese app TikTok, which was banned in In­dia last month.</p>
    <p>GOOGLE</p>
    <p>Google plans to work with Jio to pro­duce new low-cost smart­phones with An­droid-based op­er­at­ing sys­tems, in the hope of gain­ing a foothold in the world’s fastest-grow­ing smart­phone mar­ket. In­dia has 500 mil­lion smart­phone users, and the num­ber is ex­pected to grow to 700 mil­lion by 2022, ac­cord­ing to Coun­ter­point Re­search, while a fur­ther 350 mil­lion cur­rently use sim­pler “fea­ture” phones.</p>
    <p>By join­ing forces with Re­liance, which has a record of gain­ing mar­ket share through low-cost and heav­ily dis­counted prod­ucts, an­a­lysts said Google is bet­ting that the pair can come up with a phone cheap enough to at­tract the hun­dreds of mil­lions of In­di­ans still not on smart­phones.</p>
    <p>“We see the chance to have an even greater im­pact than ei­ther com­pany could have alone,” Mr Sun­dar Pichai, Google and par­ent com­pany Al­pha­bet’s chief ex­ec­u­tive, said this month.</p>
    <p>Ce­ment­ing a place in the de­vice mar­ket will also put Google in prime position to pro­mote other services, said Mr Arvind Sing­hal of con­sul­tancy Technopak, from its fast-grow­ing pay­ments app – which has nabbed mar­ket share since What­sApp’s prod­uct was de­layed – to its maps. “The prob­a­bil­ity of your phone be­com­ing the phone of choice for most users in In­dia be­comes very high. Your pen­e­tra­tion be­comes very high.”</p>
    <p>IN­TEL/QUAL­COMM</p>
    <p>In­tel and Qual­comm each took smaller stakes in Jio through their in­vest­ment arms, for US$253 mil­lion and US$97 mil­lion re­spec­tively.</p>
    <p>But the deals give the chip­mak­ers a strate­gic edge, par­tic­u­larly af­ter Mr Am­bani an­nounced this month that Jio was de­vel­op­ing its own suite of 5G services.</p>
    <p>“It’s not about just money which goes in,” said Mr Ra­jen Va­ga­dia, pres­i­dent of Qual­comm In­dia, which al­ready sup­plies parts for Jio’s phones. “It’s about col­lab­o­ra­tion, like en­gi­neer­ing sup­port, prod­uct knowl­edge, mar­ket ac­cess – all th­ese things come as part of the pack­age.”</p>
    <p>The in­vest­ments serve as a form of “soft pres­sure on Jio” to buy the chip­mak­ers’ prod­ucts, said Coun­ter­point Re­search’s Neil Shah.</p>
    <p>San Diego-based Qual­comm could sell semi­con­duc­tor chips for Jio’s 5G push with In­tel sup­ply­ing its mo­bile base sta­tions.</p>
    <p>“The in­vest­ment is driven to­wards tech­nol­ogy that In­tel Cap­i­tal and In­tel care a lot about,” said Ms Nivruti Rai, head of In­tel In­dia.</p>
    <p>Ul­ti­mately, ev­ery­one from the chip­mak­ers to the In­ter­net gi­ants is bet­ting that suc­cess in In­dia in the com­ing years can be repli­cated in other parts of the world, such as fu­ture growth mar­kets in Africa.</p>
    <p>“This mas­sive pop­u­la­tion in In­dia is one of the best grounds to prove some­thing which is scal­able, af­ford­able, and yet prof­itable,” Mr Va­ga­dia said. “I think every sin­gle com­pany has seen that.”</p>
