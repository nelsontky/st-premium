    <p>The drama be­gan in the wee hours of yes­ter­day, when lead­ers of Thai­land’s anti-gov­ern­ment protests sent out ur­gent mes­sages on Face­book and Twit­ter call­ing for demon­stra­tors to gather in Bangkok at 8am in­stead of 2pm.</p>
    <p>They said they had heard that cer­tain groups would try to oc­cupy the space around Bangkok’s Democ­racy Mon­u­ment, so they de­cided to move their plans for­ward to thwart any sab­o­tage at­tempt.</p>
    <p>This raised fears of a clash with roy­al­ist groups plan­ning to mass at key sec­tions near the mon­u­ment yes­ter­day morn­ing wear­ing the colour yel­low in a show of sup­port for King Maha Va­ji­ra­longkorn. The monarch, who keeps a home in Ger­many, was due to pass by last night on his way to a royal temple.</p>
    <p>One of the protest lead­ers, Mr Arnon Nampa, promised that demon­stra­tors would not block the mo­tor­cade but would flash the three-fin­ger anti-dic­ta­tor­ship salute as it passed.</p>
    <p>Mr Arnon was the first protest leader to raise the topic of monar­chy re­form; he did so on stage in Au­gust and the act earned him both threats and plau­dits in a coun­try where in­sult­ing the monar­chy is pun­ish­able by up to 15 years in jail.</p>
    <p>Since then, pro­test­ers have re­peat­edly called for the monarch’s power and ex­pen­di­ture to be trimmed.</p>
    <p>The roy­al­ists yes­ter­day were joined by men with uni­form crew cuts, dressed in yel­low polo shirts, who filed into the space around the</p>
    <p>Democ­racy Mon­u­ment and sat on the pave­ments be­fore 9am.</p>
    <p>The tow­er­ing ed­i­fice, which sits in the mid­dle of a traf­fic cir­cle in the grand Ratchadam­noen Av­enue, was built to com­mem­o­rate the 1932 revo­lu­tion that ended ab­so­lute</p>
    <p>monar­chy. In re­cent times, city of­fi­cials have bar­ri­caded it and filled the in­te­rior with pot­ted plants.</p>
    <p>Small con­fronta­tions be­tween roy­al­ist and anti-gov­ern­ment pro­test­ers fiz­zled out just as quickly as they started.</p>
    <p>As the af­ter­noon sun took hold, pro­test­ers be­gan re­mov­ing the plants from the mon­u­ment in a sym­bolic act of re­claim­ing the space.</p>
    <p>High-school stu­dents in school uni­forms and grey-haired women formed a hu­man chain, pass­ing the pots of green­ery from one per­son to the next un­til the side­walks were blan­keted with plants.</p>
    <p>Then protest lead­ers an­nounced that they would be­gin their march to Gov­ern­ment House, to press the rul­ing pow­ers to amend the Con­sti­tu­tion and hold fresh elec­tions.</p>
    <p>Af­ter they left, city clean­ers swooped in to freshen up the streets in preparatio­n for the royal mo­tor­cade. Peo­ple in yel­low cloth­ing sat on yel­low mats on the side­walks, wait­ing to pay their re­spects to the monarch.</p>
    <p>The march­ing pro­test­ers took a de­tour, avoid­ing a ma­jor road on which the royal mo­tor­cade was ex­pected to pass.</p>
    <p>But a com­mo­tion was re­ported near Gov­ern­ment House as the po­lice pushed back pro­test­ers to let a car car­ry­ing Queen Suthida through. Pro­test­ers flashed the three-fin­ger salute as it passed.</p>
    <p>In the end, the royal mo­tor­cade man­aged to pass largely un­hin­dered through Ratchadam­noen Av­enue yes­ter­day evening.</p>
    <p>As the roy­al­ists dis­persed and the road was re­opened to traf­fic, the Democ­racy Mon­u­ment re­mained shorn of plants.</p>
