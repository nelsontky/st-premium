    <p>In Bri­tish au­thor Su­sanna Clarke’s 2004 fan­tasy novel Jonathan Strange & Mr Nor­rell, men­tion is made of the King’s Roads: a vast, shad­owy net­work of halls, canals and stair­cases that con­nects places in this world with Faerie, which one may en­ter through a mir­ror if one knows how.</p>
    <p>Clarke’s de­but novel about feud­ing 19th-cen­tury ma­gi­cians of­fered but a few tan­ta­lis­ing glimpses of this lim­i­nal space.</p>
    <p>Six­teen years after Jonathan Strange & Mr Nor­rell’s tremen­dous suc­cess, she re­turns fi­nally to the King’s Roads – or some­thing very much like them – and a marvel­lous jour­ney it is in­deed.</p>
    <p>Jonathan Strange & Mr Nor­rell sold more than four mil­lion copies world­wide and was adapted in 2015 as a BBC minis­eries. It was longlisted for the Man Booker Prize and won the pres­ti­gious Hugo and World Fan­tasy Awards.</p>
    <p>Piranesi, it seems, cares lit­tle for any of that.</p>
    <p>It is slen­der, a lit­tle over a quar­ter of Jonathan Strange & Mr Nor­rell’s nearly 800 pages. It is part-fan­tasy, part-crime mys­tery and partBor­ge­sian fa­ble. For a good por­tion of it, the reader must op­er­ate with no con­text for what is go­ing on. It has not the am­bi­tions of its pre­de­ces­sor, but pos­sesses a strange splen­dour all its own.</p>
    <p>It is set in the House, a se­ries of un­end­ing halls, stair­ways and stat­ues in all di­rec­tions. There are three lev­els: the lower halls are flooded, the wa­ters filled with fish, crus­taceans and water lilies; rain pours from the clouds in the misty up­per halls.</p>
    <p>The middle halls, the most hab­it­able, are the do­main of birds and men.</p>
    <p>One man, to be ex­act: the nar­ra­tor, who is called Piranesi and who knows that is not his real name.</p>
    <p>Piranesi in­hab­its the House with wor­ship­ful won­der. He fishes its wa­ters, drinks its rain and tries to map its in­fi­nite halls, chart­ing the place­ment of the stat­ues and the move­ment of the tides in his jour­nal.</p>
    <p>He is the Robin­son Cru­soe of this world, not that he has con­text for who Robin­son Cru­soe is. “The Beauty of the House is im­mea­sur­able; its Kind­ness in­fi­nite,” he writes.</p>
    <p>As far as Piranesi knows, there are 15 peo­ple in the world and 13 of them are dead. He gives them names such as the Bis­cuit-Box Man and the Folded-Up Child and tends to their bones. The only other liv­ing per­son, the Other, vis­its him twice a week to dis­cuss sci­en­tific find­ings.</p>
    <p>One day, the Other warns Piranesi about a 16th per­son who must be avoided at all costs, lest their en­counter drive Piranesi mad.</p>
    <p>His­tor­i­cal con­text for the name Piranesi may sup­ply a hint for the nar­ra­tor’s sit­u­a­tion.</p>
    <p>Gio­vanni Bat­tista Piranesi was an 18th-cen­tury Ital­ian artist fa­mous for his Carceri d’in­ven­zione, or Imag­i­nary Pris­ons, etch­ings of fan­tas­tic, labyrinthi­ne ru­ins.</p>
    <p>Books pub­lished this year are in­evitably read through the lens of the pan­demic and there are un­canny par­al­lels to be found in a story about a man who lives alone in a house he does not – or can­not – leave.</p>
    <p>In the wake of Jonathan Strange & Mr Nor­rell’s pub­li­ca­tion, Clarke her­self suf­fered a de­bil­i­tat­ing ill­ness which kept her house­bound for years.</p>
    <p>The strange and un­cer­tain iso­la­tion forced upon the rest of the world by the pan­demic is some­thing she would al­ready be fa­mil­iar with and, in­deed, Piranesi is a med­i­ta­tion on find­ing mean­ing in one’s world, how­ever large or small.</p>
    <p>Though the Other seeks knowl­edge and power in the House, Piranesi has no in­ter­est in these things.</p>
    <p>“I re­alised that the search for the Knowl­edge has en­cour­aged us to think of the House as if it were a sort of rid­dle to be un­rav­elled, a text to be in­ter­preted, and that if ever we dis­cover the Knowl­edge, then it will be as if the Value has been wrested from the House and all that re­mains will be mere scenery,” he writes.</p>
    <p>“The House is valu­able be­cause it is the House. It is enough in and of It­self. It is not the means to an end.”</p>
    <p>Clarke’s dizzy­ing con­tem­pla­tions of space and lim­i­nal­ity, mem­ory and mad­ness are grounded by her nar­ra­tor’s gen­tle sim­plic­ity.</p>
    <p>Piranesi, though he is un­aware of it, is a sur­vivor, hav­ing gone through some­thing so trau­matic, it has taken away his knowl­edge of him­self and merged his iden­tity with that of the House.</p>
    <p>But he is not un­happy. “May your Paths be safe, your Floors un­bro­ken, and may the House fill your eyes with Beauty,” he says. As wishes go, it is a good one for these times.</p>
    <p>If you like this, read: The Star­less Sea by Erin Mor­gen­stern (Ran­dom House, 2019, $27.95, avail­able at bit.ly/Star­lessSea_EM). When Zachary Ezra Rawl­ins bor­rows a book from the univer­sity li­brary that should not be there, it leads him to the Star­less Sea, a se­cret labyrinth be­neath the earth where count­less sto­ries are kept.</p>
