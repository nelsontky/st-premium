    <p>• Real Madrid cap­tain Ser­gio Ramos is look­ing for­ward to boost­ing his im­pres­sive goal tally after net­ting a mile­stone 100th for the club in all com­pe­ti­tions to help them se­cure a vi­tal 3-2 Cham­pi­ons League win over In­ter Mi­lan on Tues­day.</p>
    <p>Ramos, who has won 22 tro­phies in­clud­ing four ti­tles in Europe’s elite club com­pe­ti­tion with Real, net­ted a trade­mark header from a Toni Kroos cor­ner to put them 2-0 up be­fore In­ter lev­elled to force a dra­matic cli­max to the game.</p>
    <p>Brazil­ian sub­sti­tute Rodrygo ri­fled in a late win­ner to give Real their first win in Group B after a 3-2 home de­feat by Shakhtar Donetsk and a 2-2 draw at lead­ers Borus­sia Monchengla­dbach.</p>
    <p>“It’s not bad,” Ramos, 34, said after hit­ting the mile­stone at the Al­fredo di Ste­fano Sta­dium.</p>
    <p>“In­di­vid­ual records are se­condary, but you like hit­ting them</p>
    <p>Headed goals out of the 100 scored by Ser­gio Ramos for Real Madrid. and as long as they keep on help­ing the side win, hope­fully I can get a few more.</p>
    <p>“It was a tough game, but we were able to get a good re­sult and se­cure three very im­por­tant points. We knew it was a do-or-die game and when you are pegged back to a draw in a match you were win­ning, you need to push on.”</p>
    <p>Ramos’ 23 goals for Spain also makes him the top scor­ing de­fender in in­ter­na­tional his­tory while no de­fender has more La Liga goals (74) since he over­took Ron­ald Koe­man’s record of 67 in June.</p>
    <p>Lau­taro Martinez and Ivan Perisic gave In­ter hope of vic­tory but Rodrygo fi­nally sealed the win in the 80th minute.</p>
    <p>Un­der pres­sure after a poor start to Real’s Cham­pi­ons League cam­paign, coach Zine­dine Zi­dane was re­lieved his team were able to bounce back ahead of the re­verse fix­ture in Mi­lan on Nov 25.</p>
    <p>“We suf­fered but we need to pat our boys on the back be­cause they de­served to win,” he said.</p>
    <p>“We started re­ally well, press­ing high as we like to do. We went 2-0 up but then we con­ceded quickly and couldn’t play our football.”</p>
    <p>The French­man also said that he has no doubt Ramos will ex­tend his stay with the La Liga cham­pi­ons.</p>
    <p>The de­fender, who joined from Sevilla in 2005, will be free to leave when his con­tract ex­pires at the end of the sea­son.</p>
    <p>“We know what a great player he is... He’s our cap­tain, our leader and of course we want him to be with us for­ever,” Zi­dane said.</p>
    <p>“That’s what he’s do­ing, showing that he’s al­ways got that de­sire and I’m in no doubt that he’s go­ing to stay here and will con­tinue to re­write the his­tory books.”</p>
