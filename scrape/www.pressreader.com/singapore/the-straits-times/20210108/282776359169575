    <p>Chi­nese ac­tress Angelababy and her hus­band, ac­tor Huang</p>
    <p>Xiaom­ing (both above), have clar­i­fied that she was not the</p>
    <p>“third party” in his pre­vi­ous re­la­tion­ship. The 31-year-old, whose real name is An­gela Ye­ung, mar­ried Huang, 43, in 2015. The cou­ple have a four-year-old son.</p>
    <p>Huang re­cently hosted Chi­nese re­al­ity TV show Sis­ters Who Make Waves (2020).</p>
    <p>The show was well re­ceived and the sec­ond sea­son is slated to be aired this year, with Huang’s ex-girl­friend, Chi­nese ac­tress Li Feier (right), as one of the con­tes­tants. Li’s ap­pear­ance on the same stage with Huang re­vived a decade-old rumour that Ye­ung was the third party in their re­la­tion­ship between 2007 and 2010.</p>
    <p>Li, now 33, hinted in an in­ter­view with a Hong Kong magazine in 2011 that Ye­ung was the one who came between her and Huang.</p>
    <p>On Wed­nes­day, Ye­ung took to Weibo to re­but this al­le­ga­tion, writ­ing in Chi­nese: “When I first met Huang Xiaom­ing, he told me he was sin­gle un­til Li Feier made the ground­less ac­cu­sa­tion in a magazine in­ter­view. I asked Mr Huang about it im­me­di­ately and he told me they have bro­ken up. It is that sim­ple. I did not want to ex­plain as firstly, it was un­nec­es­sary, and se­condly, I live life for my­self... Ten years later, I have cho­sen to stand up and ex­plain it as the bur­den on my shoul­ders is too heavy and I don’t want to carry it any­more.”</p>
    <p>Huang went on Weibo in sup­port of his wife about 15 min­utes later, and urged ne­ti­zens not to hurt his fam­ily. The cou­ple have been dogged by ru­mours of di­vorce in re­cent years, due in part to the lack of in­ter­ac­tion between them in public.</p>
    <p>Ne­ti­zens also no­ticed that Ye­ung, a reg­u­lar cast mem­ber of Chi­nese va­ri­ety show Keep Run­ning (2017 to present), used “Mr Huang” to ad­dress her hus­band in her post on Wed­nes­day.</p>
