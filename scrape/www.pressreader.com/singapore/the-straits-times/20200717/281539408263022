    <p>With some fi­nan­cial re­lief mea­sures ta­per­ing off by the year end, the Mon­e­tary Author­ity of Sin­ga­pore will dis­cuss with banks and in­sur­ers on how best to wean com­pa­nies and in­di­vid­u­als off the sup­port. This will al­low them to grad­u­ally ease back into mak­ing re­pay­ments, such as for de­ferred loans.</p>
    <p>Hav­ing rid­den to the res­cue of com­pa­nies and in­di­vid­u­als dur­ing the coro­n­avirus cri­sis, the cen­tral bank has started plan­ning a soft land­ing for them when the re­lief mea­sures are rolled back by the end of this year.</p>
    <p>It has started dis­cussing with banks how bor­row­ers can grad­u­ally re­sume re­pay­ments to them. At the height of the cri­sis, the Mon­e­tary Author­ity of Sin­ga­pore (MAS) had thrown such cash-squeezed busi­nesses and in­di­vid­u­als a life­line by al­low­ing them to de­fer re­pay­ments.</p>
    <p>Ob­servers said a good exit pol­icy from the re­lief mea­sures was im­por­tant as it could other­wise lead to many bor­row­ers de­fault­ing on loans.</p>
    <p>Speak­ing at the re­lease of the cen­tral bank’s an­nual re­port yes­ter­day, its man­ag­ing di­rec­tor Ravi Menon said that the re­lief mea­sures im­ple­mented dur­ing the pan­demic have done their part to help com­pa­nies and in­di­vid­u­als stay afloat.</p>
    <p>But bank loans and in­sur­ance pol­icy pre­mi­ums even­tu­ally have to be paid, he said. What MAS was do­ing was to dis­cuss with banks and in­sur­ers how to ease bor­row­ers and pol­i­cy­hold­ers into grad­u­ally re­sum­ing re­pay­ments when the re­lief mea­sures, which in­clude debt mora­to­ri­ums on mort­gage pay­ments, fi­nally draw to a close.</p>
    <p>“We will not have a cliff ef­fect – which means it is not as if all will be with­drawn on Dec 31,” he said.</p>
    <p>“I (also) don’t think we can con­tinue (pro­vid­ing) these re­liefs in­def­i­nitely be­cause the longer you con­tinue them, the more at risk some of these bor­row­ers will be in terms of re­pay­ment,” he added.</p>
    <p>Out­lin­ing the scale of the re­lief op­er­a­tions, he said that banks have de­ferred pay­ments on prin­ci­pal or in­ter­est, or both, on about 34,000 mort­gage loans un­til Dec 31. They have also de­ferred both prin­ci­pal and in­ter­est pay­ments on more than 2,100 ren­o­va­tion and ed­u­ca­tion loans.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, more than 25,000 life and health in­sur­ance pol­i­cy­hold­ers have de­ferred their pre­mi­ums while main­tain­ing cov­er­age.</p>
    <p>Pay­ment de­fer­ments have also been made on more than 5,300 small and medium-sized en­ter­prises’ se­cured loans. “But de­ferred pay­ments pro­vide only tem­po­rary re­lief and come with longer-term costs,” he pointed out.</p>
    <p>Mr Menon said the cen­tral bank aims to an­nounce the re­sults of its anal­y­sis with the banks by Oc­to­ber to give debtors time to pre­pare for their re­pay­ments.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore Busi­ness Fed­er­a­tion chief ex­ec­u­tive Ho Meng Kit agreed that busi­nesses must ac­cept that at some point banks would cut back on the fi­nanc­ing avail­able to them. “Un­wind­ing a large pile of bad debt can cost other prob­lems for the econ­omy,” he noted.</p>
    <p>“We hope MAS... will pro­vide busi­nesses with ad­e­quate no­tice and a glide path on the with­drawal of the re­lief mea­sures,” said Mr Ho.</p>
    <p>CIMB Pri­vate Bank­ing econ­o­mist Song Seng Wun echoed this sen­ti­ment, say­ing that banks may face a higher num­ber of de­faults if peo­ple were pres­sured into pay­ing larger amounts of debt that have ac­cu­mu­lated over the mora­to­rium pe­riod. Debtors may also run into more fi­nan­cial is­sues if they are not given the in­for­ma­tion to pre­pare for a re­pay­ment sched­ule, he said.</p>
    <p>As­so­ci­a­tion of Small and Medium En­ter­prises pres­i­dent Kurt Wee hopes that MAS “will not wind down help” and ex­tend the ex­ist­ing re­lief mea­sures.</p>
    <p>“Busi­nesses will con­tinue to re­quire the sup­port of MAS for the du­ra­tion that we are im­pacted by Covid-19,” he added.</p>
    <p>“If there is a de­par­ture from the cur­rent pre-elec­tion mea­sures, busi­nesses will find the ad­just­ment over­whelm­ing be­cause they are al­ready sub­jected to tremen­dous re­stric­tions to how far they can op­er­ate their busi­nesses,” Mr Wee said.</p>
    <p>CIMB’s Mr Song added that MAS’ dis­cus­sions with banks on re­pay­ment by bor­row­ers would lift some un­cer­tainty over the is­sue.</p>
    <p>“In­di­vid­u­als will have more in­for­ma­tion so they can start plan­ning, and banks will have a bet­ter idea on who can re­pay their loans on time and who needs more help,” he said.</p>
    <p>“All this in­for­ma­tion will save the cen­tral bank some headache.”</p>
    <p>The Mon­e­tary Author­ity of Sin­ga­pore (MAS) recorded a net profit of $10.6 bil­lion in the fi­nan­cial year that ended March 31, af­ter a $2.2 bil­lion con­tri­bu­tion to the Gov­ern­ment’s con­sol­i­dated fund.</p>
    <p>This was down from last year’s net profit of $19.2 bil­lion, af­ter a $3.9 bil­lion con­tri­bu­tion to the con­sol­i­dated fund.</p>
    <p>The author­ity’s to­tal ex­pen­di­ture in­creased to $4.4 bil­lion, mostly due to higher in­ter­est ex­penses from its do­mes­tic money mar­ket op­er­a­tions dur­ing the lat­est fi­nan­cial year, the MAS said in its an­nual re­port that was re­leased yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The cen­tral bank said its to­tal in­come of $17.2 bil­lion came mainly from pos­i­tive cur­rency trans­la­tion ef­fects from the strength­en­ing of the green­back, euro and Ja­panese yen against the Sing­dol­lar.</p>
    <p>In­vest­ment in­come was lower com­pared to the pre­vi­ous fi­nan­cial year due to a sharp de­cline in the global mar­kets in the fi­nal quar­ter.</p>
    <p>The MAS Board has ap­proved a re­turn of $5.3 bil­lion to the Gov­ern­ment for the 2019/2020 fi­nan­cial year.</p>
    <p>The author­ity’s to­tal cap­i­tal and re­serves in­creased to $44.9 bil­lion as at March 31.</p>
