    <p>A reg­u­la­tory gap now ex­ists with the Mon­e­tary Author­ity of Sin­ga­pore reg­u­lat­ing the fi­nan­cial as­pects of health in­surance providers, but no agency reg­u­lat­ing the health cov­er­age pro­vided. To ef­fec­tively and holis­ti­cally reg­u­late health in­surance, and in so do­ing di­rectly pro­tect the in­ter­ests of pa­tients, one should look at both as­pects of the busi­ness, says Dr Wong Chi­ang Yin.</p>
    <p>MediShield Life was im­ple­mented by the Gov­ern­ment in Novem­ber 2015. Since then, all Sin­ga­pore­ans re­gard­less of age or pre-ex­ist­ing dis­eases have cover from this uni­ver­sal health in­surance scheme.</p>
    <p>To­gether with Medis­ave, should a Sin­ga­porean choose sub­sidised care (in a Class B2 or C ward) from re­struc­tured hos­pi­tals, MediShield Life will largely en­sure that Sin­ga­pore­ans do not have to make out-of-pocket payments for 90 per cent of bills.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore­ans who de­sire to seek care from “pri­vate” classes (B1 or A class) in re­struc­tured hos­pi­tals or pri­vate hos­pi­tals have the op­tion of buy­ing In­te­grated Shield Plans (IPs) from pri­vate in­surance com­pa­nies.</p>
    <p>There are now seven in­surance com­pa­nies sell­ing IPs, or IP providers. IPs give higher pay­outs that will cover much of the larger bills that arise from pri­vate classes of re­struc­tured hos­pi­tals and pri­vate hos­pi­tals.</p>
    <p>Both MediShield Life and IP pre­mi­ums can be paid for by Medis­ave ac­counts.</p>
    <p>Ear­lier this year, one IP provider, Aviva, de­cided it would no longer pro­vide cov­er­age for di­ag­nos­tic en­do­scopies to its IP pol­icy hold­ers. Di­ag­nos­tic en­do­scopies are fre­quently performed to di­ag­nose many con­di­tions, in­clud­ing com­mon can­cers such as colon, stom­ach, blad­der and na­sopha­ryn­geal (nose and throat) can­cers.</p>
    <p>This nat­u­rally cre­ated much un­hap­pi­ness and con­cern in the med­i­cal fra­ter­nity. A de­lay in cancer di­ag­no­sis has omi­nous con­se­quences. The Sin­ga­pore Med­i­cal As­so­ci­a­tion wrote to</p>
    <p>The Straits Times Fo­rum page (In­sur­ers set dan­ger­ous prece­dent by not cov­er­ing di­ag­nos­tic pro­ce­dures, Aug 29) to high­light this prob­lem.</p>
    <p>The chair­man of the Gov­ern­ment Par­lia­men­tary Com­mit­tee for Health, med­i­cal on­col­o­gist Tan Wu Meng, re­ferred to this let­ter in his par­lia­men­tary speech on Sept 1 high­light­ing the prob­lems fac­ing peo­ple who have bought IPs.</p>
    <p>His com­ments are in­sight­ful and bear re­pro­duc­ing here.</p>
    <p>“In a Straits Times Fo­rum let­ter pub­lished on Aug 29, the Sin­ga­pore Med­i­cal As­so­ci­a­tion shared that some in­sur­ers are no longer al­low­ing claims for di­ag­nos­tic en­do­scopies even when med­i­cally nec­es­sary.”</p>
    <p>De­scrib­ing this as “a se­ri­ous devel­op­ment” with im­pli­ca­tions for pa­tient care and safety, he added: “It is also a very vis­i­ble sign that in­di­vid­ual pa­tients, in­di­vid­ual cus­tomers do not have bar­gain­ing power to stop in­surance com­pa­nies from such prac­tices. When an in­surance com­pany moves the goal­posts for an In­te­grated Shield Plan, it is not so easy for a pa­tient to switch provider, be­cause ex­ist­ing con­di­tions be­come pre-ex­ist­ing con­di­tions un­der the new pol­icy.”</p>
    <p>He called for the au­thor­i­ties to step in. “The in­vis­i­ble hand of the mar­ket ap­pears to have be­come un­bal­anced. And so I call upon MOH and MAS to look into this and see if the vis­i­ble hand of the reg­u­la­tors needs to come in to level the play­ing field for pa­tients,” he said. The two agen­cies are the Min­istry of Health (MOH) and Mon­e­tary Author­ity of Sin­ga­pore (MAS), which reg­u­lates fi­nan­cial ser­vices in­clud­ing in­surance.</p>
    <p>In this case, for­tu­nately, Aviva re­versed this pol­icy on Sept 4 and re­in­stated cov­er­age of di­ag­nos­tic en­do­scopies. But this in­ci­dent has opened up some ques­tions of how IP providers can uni­lat­er­ally de­cide on what to cover and what not to cover in their IPs.</p>
    <p>In the process, al­though a pol­icy holder may have paid his IP pre­mi­ums, he may even be worse off than an­other per­son who re­lies only on “gar­den-va­ri­ety” MediShield Life for health­care in­surance cov­er­age.</p>
    <p>THE WRONG AP­PROACH</p>
    <p>Let us take the ex­am­ple of a colonoscop­y, since it is the gold stan­dard for de­tect­ing the com­mon­est cancer in Sin­ga­pore – col­orec­tal cancer. The whole idea of per­form­ing a colonoscop­y is to de­tect cancer or polyps as early as pos­si­ble. There is a high chance that non-can­cer­ous polyps will be­come cancer later on and they should be re­moved dur­ing the colonoscop­y. Polyps are com­mon find­ings in colono­scopies.</p>
    <p>De­pend­ing on how many and how big these polyps are, these pro­ce­dures are clas­si­fied as ei­ther Ta­ble 3A, 3B or 3C. Ta­ble of Op­er­a­tions is the MOH’s way of clas­si­fy­ing op­er­a­tions by com­plex­ity. They range from Ta­ble 1A (least com­plex) to 7C (most com­plex).</p>
    <p>If a claim is made for a colonoscop­y where there are polyps found and then re­moved dur­ing the pro­ce­dure, MediShield Life ac­tu­ally makes pay­outs; the size of the pay­outs is pegged to the bill sizes of sub­sidised classes in re­struc­tured hos­pi­tals. Ba­si­cally, MediShield Life is de­signed to make pay­outs for Ta­ble 3 op­er­a­tions or higher. For Ta­ble 1 and 2 op­er­a­tions, MediShield Life is not needed and Medis­ave alone should suf­fice as the bill sizes are smaller.</p>
    <p>Some may think that since there are polyps to be re­moved in the pro­ce­dure, then such colono­scopies are deemed “ther­a­peu­tic colono­scopies” and hence will be cov­ered.</p>
    <p>How­ever, in an ac­tual case ex­pe­ri­enced by a pri­vate sec­tor gas­troen­terol­o­gist, the IP claim was ini­tially de­nied be­cause some­one de­cided that re­moval of polyps was a “pre­ven­tive mea­sure”, given the fact that the polyps were still non-can­cer­ous at the time of the pro­ce­dure, ig­nor­ing the fact that polyps have a sig­nif­i­cant chance of turn­ing can­cer­ous later on.</p>
    <p>In a March 16 let­ter signed by Aviva chief ex­ec­u­tive of­fi­cer Nishit Ma­j­mu­dar, he quoted two in­stances of al­leged “over-con­sump­tion and over-ser­vic­ing within the health­care sec­tor”, in an ap­par­ent at­tempt to jus­tify with­drawal of the com­pany’s IP cov­er­age for di­ag­nos­tic en­do­scopes, in­clud­ing “any treat­ment to pre­vent ill­ness”.</p>
    <p>I think such an ap­proach is mis­guided. There are more than 14,000 reg­is­tered med­i­cal prac­ti­tion­ers in Sin­ga­pore. Truth be told, there will al­ways be a few un­eth­i­cal doc­tors among them who will over-ser­vice pa­tients and they need to be taken to task.</p>
    <p>But there are es­tab­lished av­enues for this through the MOH or the Sin­ga­pore Med­i­cal Coun­cil. Civil lit­i­ga­tion and me­di­a­tion can also be used to ad­dress cer­tain dis­putes in­volv­ing money.</p>
    <p>Di­min­ish­ing the scope of IP cov­er­age to below that of even MediShield Life by with­draw­ing cov­er­age of cer­tain pro­ce­dures so as to ad­dress over-ser­vic­ing is not the way to go.</p>
    <p>There is a mis­con­cep­tion that IPs are bought only by the mid­dle class or wealthy. In fact, ac­cord­ing to a re­port pub­lished by the Health In­surance Task Force in 2016, two-thirds of Sin­ga­pore res­i­dents bought IPs. Half of these IP pol­icy hold­ers also bought riders that pro­vided first-dol­lar cov­er­age (which ob­vi­ates the need to pay de­ductibles and co-pay­ment).</p>
    <p>GAP IN REG­U­LA­TION</p>
    <p>The de­ci­sion to with­draw cov­er­age for cer­tain pro­ce­dures by IP providers high­lights a big­ger prob­lem with health in­surance reg­u­la­tion in Sin­ga­pore to­day. The sale of in­surance prod­ucts sold in Sin­ga­pore is reg­u­lated by the MAS mainly through the In­surance Act and Fi­nan­cial Ad­vis­ers Act (FAA). The In­surance Act deals mainly with li­cens­ing of in­surance com­pa­nies and the fi­nan­cial man­age­ment of these com­pa­nies, such as main­tain­ing fund sol­vency, cap­i­tal ad­e­quacy, cus­tody and maintenanc­e of as­sets and so on.</p>
    <p>In ad­di­tion, in­surance is di­vided into life and gen­eral in­surance. Health be­longs to gen­eral in­surance. While there are strict def­i­ni­tions and re­quire­ments gov­ern­ing the sale of life in­surance prod­ucts un­der the FAA, what is cov­ered or not cov­ered in gen­eral in­surance (health in­surance, for ex­am­ple) is usu­ally deemed a com­mer­cial mat­ter be­tween the in­surer and the in­sured.</p>
    <p>The author­ity that ad­min­is­ters the In­surance Act is the MAS.</p>
    <p>The In­surance Act fo­cuses on the safety and sound­ness of the reg­u­lated en­tity and, there­fore, in­di­rectly safe­guards the con­sumer. But it does not re­ally talk much about pro­tect­ing con­sumer rights in terms of scope of cov­er­age or size of pay­outs.</p>
    <p>MAS prob­a­bly does not have the ex­per­tise or the ex­pe­ri­ence to take a po­si­tion on what dis­eases or pro­ce­dures should or should not be cov­ered un­der an IP.</p>
    <p>The health­care ex­per­tise ob­vi­ously re­sides with the MOH, but it is not leg­isla­tively po­si­tioned to reg­u­late in­surance com­pa­nies or health in­surance.</p>
    <p>In­ter­est­ingly, MAS has also is­sued guide­lines on fair deal­ing in 2009 un­der the FAA. But it is un­clear if health in­surance prod­ucts, es­pe­cially IPs, come un­der fi­nan­cial ad­vi­sory prod­ucts sold by li­censed fi­nan­cial deal­ers or fi­nan­cial in­sti­tu­tions. They prob­a­bly do not, be­cause if they did, one would re­ally won­der how an IP provider uni­lat­er­ally and sud­denly with­draw­ing cov­er­age for cer­tain pro­ce­dures would con­sti­tute fair deal­ing.</p>
    <p>As such, the en­vi­ron­ment to­day is as what Dr Tan has said in Par­lia­ment – the in­di­vid­ual pa­tient lacks bar­gain­ing power to stop IP providers from mov­ing the goal­posts by chang­ing the scope of cov­er­age.</p>
    <p>The cur­rent reg­u­la­tory frame­work also does not give these in­di­vid­ual pa­tients suf­fi­cient pro­tec­tion from these prac­tices. To­day, it may be di­ag­nos­tic en­do­scopies, to­mor­row it may be some­thing else.</p>
    <p>To ef­fec­tively and holis­ti­cally reg­u­late health in­surance, and in so do­ing di­rectly pro­tect the in­ter­ests of pa­tients, one should look at both as­pects of the busi­ness – the fi­nan­cial and ac­tu­ar­ial part, as well as the health­care part.</p>
    <p>Un­for­tu­nately, there ap­pears to be a reg­u­la­tory void on the health­care side that needs to be ad­dressed ur­gently. This is es­pe­cially so when IPs in­volve Medis­ave monies which, in turn, are taken from our Cen­tral Prov­i­dent Fund (CPF) sav­ings.</p>
    <p>After all, since the found­ing of our coun­try, the Gov­ern­ment has al­ways been a pru­dent and ac­tive cus­to­dian of how CPF money can be used. We need to reg­u­late the health in health in­surance IPs.</p>
