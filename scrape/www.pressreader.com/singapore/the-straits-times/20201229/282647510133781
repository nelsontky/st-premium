    <p>•</p>
    <p>LOS AN­GE­LES Won­der Woman 1984 pulled in US$36.1 mil­lion (S$48 mil­lion) at world­wide cin­e­mas over the Christ­mas hol­i­day week­end and boosted stream­ing view­er­ship on HBO Max, Warner Bros said on Sun­day.</p>
    <p>It also con­firmed plans for a third film in the su­per­hero fran­chise.</p>
    <p>An es­ti­mated US$16.7 mil­lion of the box-of­fice to­tal came from Amer­i­can and Cana­dian the­atres, the AT&T-owned stu­dio said on Sun­day.</p>
    <p>That ranked as the high­est open­ing in North Amer­ica since the coro­n­avirus pan­demic shut­tered cin­e­mas i n March, though the num­bers were a frac­tion of usual re­ceipts for a big-bud­get ac­tion flick.</p>
    <p>The Won­der Woman film in 2017 opened with US$103.2 mil­lion in North Amer­ica.</p>
    <p>With two-thirds of North Amer­i­can the­atres closed, Warner Bros opted for an unusual ar­range­ment, mak­ing Won­der Woman 1984 avail­able at the same time to Amer­i­can cus­tomers of AT&T’s HBO Max stream­ing ser­vice.</p>
    <p>Mil­lions watched the film on HBO Max, the com­pany said in a state­ment, but it did not spec­ify how long they tuned in. To­tal view­ing hours on the plat­form tripled last Fri­day com­pared with a typ­i­cal day in the pre­vi­ous month, the state­ment said.</p>
    <p>The movie “ex­ceeded our ex­pec­ta­tions across all of our key view­ing and sub­scriber met­rics in its first 24 hours on the ser­vice”, said Mr Andy Forsell, ex­ec­u­tive vice-pres­i­dent and gen­eral man­ager of Warn­erMe­dia Di­rect-to­Con­sumer.</p>
    <p>Warner Bros said it would ac­cel­er­ate de­vel­op­ment of a third Won­der Woman movie also writ­ten and di­rected by Patty Jenk­ins and star­ring Gal Gadot as the las­sowield­ing war­rior. The stu­dio did not an­nounce a re­lease date.</p>
    <p>Mr Paul Der­garabe­dian, se­nior me­dia analyst at re­search firm Com­score, said Won­der Woman 1984 per­formed well in the­atres given “an ex­tremely chal­leng­ing mar­ket­place”.</p>
    <p>“Con­sid­er­ing the avail­abil­ity of this blockbuste­r film at home, the num­bers for the the­atri­cal de­but of Won­der Woman 1984 should be en­cour­ag­ing to the­atri­cal ex­hi­bi­tion,” he said.</p>
    <p>Won­der Woman 1984 faced com­pe­ti­tion from crit­i­cally praised Pixar an­i­mated movie Soul, which Walt Dis­ney de­liv­ered to the Dis­ney+ stream­ing ser­vice and some cin­e­mas overseas.</p>
    <p>The story of a mu­sic teacher seek­ing his life’s pur­pose took i n US$7.6 mil­lion in cin­e­mas, Dis­ney said. It did not dis­close how many peo­ple watched Soul via stream­ing.</p>
    <p>Warner Bros has an­nounced the same hy­brid re­lease strat­egy for its 17 the­atri­cal movies next year, spark­ing a back­lash from some top Hol­ly­wood direc­tors and cin­ema oper­a­tors, who hope for a re­bound after Covid-19 vac­ci­na­tions in­crease.</p>
    <p>Through Sun­day, this year’s North Amer­i­can box-of­fice re­ceipts to­talled US$2.3 bil­lion, down 80 per cent from a year ear­lier, ac­cord­ing to Com­score.</p>
