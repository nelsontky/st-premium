    <p>Al­most all coun­tries have ei­ther closed their bor­ders or will con­tinue to im­pose strict in­bound and out­bound rules for a while more. But cri­sis al­ways brings op­por­tu­nity.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore can be the first to of­fer it­self as a “safe venue” for busi­ness trav­ellers and govern­ment of­fi­cials, espe­cially when a face-to-face meet­ing is es­sen­tial (Sin­ga­pore as a hub: Re­new­ing Asean’s rel­e­vance, Aug 14; and Cru­cial to re­vive air travel and pre­serve Sin­ga­pore’s hub status: Ong, July 31).</p>
    <p>If ex­e­cuted well, Sin­ga­pore will have first-mover ad­van­tage in of­fer­ing a unique and high value-added so­lu­tion for trav­ellers.</p>
    <p>Some coun­tries have been considerin­g set­ting up travel bub­bles with coun­tries they deem safe – sim­i­lar to the ar­range­ments be­ing dis­cussed be­tween Sin­ga­pore and Ja­pan to al­low cross-bor­der travel.</p>
    <p>But such ar­range­ments are usu­ally very exclusive ones. For ex­am­ple, coun­try A may have travel bub­ble ar­range­ments with coun­tries B and C. But coun­try B and coun­try C may not have set up a travel bub­ble be­tween them.</p>
    <p>In such a sit­u­a­tion, Sin­ga­pore can play the role of a “safe mid­dle ground” for trav­ellers from coun­tries B and C to meet.</p>
    <p>If the Mice (meet­ings, in­cen­tives, con­fer­ences and ex­hi­bi­tions) and hos­pi­tal­ity sec­tors work with the au­thor­i­ties, we could of­fer the world a seamless pack­age for trav­ellers from their ports of de­par­ture, while cre­at­ing a “lo­cal bub­ble” while they are in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>This pack­age would in­clude travel on Sin­ga­pore Air­lines flights, ded­i­cated lo­cal trans­fers to des­ig­nated ho­tels – with full fa­cil­i­ties for ac­com­mo­da­tion, busi­ness events or meet­ings, and food and bev­er­age – and ded­i­cated lo­cal trans­fer back to the air­port.</p>
    <p>Face-to-face meet­ings usu­ally pro­duce more and bet­ter out­comes, espe­cially in build­ing closer re­la­tion­ships.</p>
    <p>For trav­ellers who wish to shop, our re­tail­ers and concierge teams can help with the or­der­ing and delivery of pur­chases with­out these trav­ellers hav­ing to step out­side of the “bub­ble”.</p>
    <p>Our highly re­garded med­i­cal and health­care in­fra­struc­ture will cer­tainly give the vis­i­tors even greater peace of mind.</p>
    <p>Covid-19 is likely to af­fect most busi­nesses for a long time. If we launch this ini­tia­tive and it works well, the ex­pe­ri­ence we gain will pos­i­tively shape how the in­dus­try will op­er­ate in the “new nor­mal” en­vi­ron­ment.</p>
    <p>More im­por­tantly, it will put us ahead of the com­pe­ti­tion.</p>
