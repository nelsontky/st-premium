    <p>The up­com­ing US elec­tion on Nov 3 will be a sub­dued af­fair for the Amer­i­can com­mu­nity in Sin­ga­pore, as Covid-19 is keep­ing the ex­pa­tri­ate vot­ers here away from gath­er­ings.</p>
    <p>Gone this year be­cause of safe dis­tanc­ing mea­sures will be the post­elec­tion par­ties that were tra­di­tion­ally held at ho­tels and bars af­ter the elec­tion re­sults are known, so the at­mos­phere is set to be qui­eter this time, US cit­i­zens liv­ing here told The Sun­day Times.</p>
    <p>The Amer­i­can Club, where Amer­i­can ex­pats here used to gather in pre­vi­ous US elec­tions to watch the un­fold­ing high­lights and out­comes, will also be qui­eter this year, although a club spokesman said on Fri­day that it will be or­gan­is­ing ac­tiv­i­ties for mem­bers.</p>
    <p>For ex­am­ple, it will roll out a break­fast bun­dle pre­pared by its chefs on Tues­day for club mem­bers who are fol­low­ing the count­down to the elec­tion in the United States as it en­ters the fi­nal lap.</p>
    <p>The take­away bun­dles, which can be picked up at the club in Or­chard Road or de­liv­ered to mem­bers’ doorsteps, will re­place the break­fast or buf­fet that was usu­ally laid out for mem­bers who gath­ered at the club for the re­sults screen­ing party, the spokesman added.</p>
    <p>Health and well­ness coach Jamie Ali­son Kloor-Shin said she will be hav­ing friends over to her new place in Boon Keng and keep the num­ber of vis­i­tors to no more than five.</p>
    <p>Mrs Kloor-Shin, 40, a reg­is­tered voter in New Jersey, told The Sun­day Times: “It’s an ex­cit­ing elec­tion to watch.” She also said she had not ex­pected the in­cum­bent, Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump, to win the last elec­tion in 2016, and is keen to see how this one will turn out.</p>
    <p>Mrs Kloor-Shin, who has lived in Sin­ga­pore for five years with her hus­band, an in­no­va­tion di­rec­tor, and their 21/ 2- year-old son, said she voted for Demo­cratic pres­i­den­tial can­di­date Joe Bi­den by ab­sen­tee bal­lot be­cause she finds his stance on wealth dis­tri­bu­tion and women’s rights closer to hers, although she still has reser­va­tions about his stance on abor­tion.</p>
    <p>Repub­li­cans Over­seas Sin­ga­pore chair­man Tina Datta, 52, said she and other US cit­i­zens here have been able to go about their lives nor­mally be­cause of the mea­sures in place. She said she is grate­ful for this.</p>
    <p>First-time voter Nicholas Low, 18, a mu­si­cian who moved to Sin­ga­pore three months ago, said he is vot­ing for Mr Bi­den, though he is not par­tic­u­larly drawn to ei­ther can­di­date.</p>
    <p>Mr Low said that he favoured Mr Bi­den over Mr Trump be­cause “he just has more po­lit­i­cal ex­pe­ri­ence, is more ma­ture, and isn’t so child­ish with his de­ci­sions”.</p>
    <p>At least one US ci­ti­zen here is vot­ing for in­de­pen­dent can­di­date Jo Jor­gensen, the Lib­er­tar­ian Party’s pres­i­den­tial can­di­date.</p>
    <p>Ms Myra Kaitlyn An­drews, 26, who works in a tu­ition cen­tre here, said she could not de­cide be­tween Mr Trump and Mr Bi­den, but still wanted to ex­er­cise her right to vote.</p>
    <p>Ms An­drews, who has been in Sin­ga­pore for 14 months, said: “I’m more con­cerned with hav­ing less tax­a­tion. I gave up my state ties to South Carolina so as to not worry about state taxes, but I’m still Amer­i­can and may pos­si­bly owe the fed­eral gov­ern­ment later on if I make over US$100,000 (S$136,000).</p>
    <p>“Amer­i­cans get dou­ble taxed if they make over this thresh­old... and I have no de­sire to go back. Life in Sin­ga­pore is much more con­ducive to my life­style and views.”</p>
