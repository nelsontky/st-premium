    <p>GENEVA • Nearly 300,000 new coron­avirus cases glob­ally were recorded within 24 hours, the World Health Or­gan­i­sa­tion (WHO) said on Fri­day, in the pan­demic’s big­gest sin­gle-day spike.</p>
    <p>Of the 292,527 cases re­ported, the big­gest in­creases were from the United States, Brazil, In­dia and South Africa, according to a WHO daily re­port. Deaths rose by 6,812.</p>
    <p>The coron­avirus has killed over 680,000 peo­ple and in­fected at least 17.8 mil­lion since it emerged in China last De­cem­ber, according to the pan­demic tracker Worl­dome­ter last night.</p>
    <p>“The pan­demic is a once-in-a-cen­tury health cri­sis, the ef­fects of which will be felt for decades to come,” WHO di­rec­tor-gen­eral Te­dros Ad­hanom Ghe­breye­sus told a meet­ing of the agency’s emer­gency com­mit­tee, according to re­marks re­leased on Fri­day.</p>
    <p>The US, Brazil, Mex­ico and Britain have been par­tic­u­larly hard hit in re­cent weeks by the Covid-19 dis­ease, as their gov­ern­ments have strug­gled to come up with an ef­fec­tive re­sponse.</p>
    <p>Mex­ico has over­taken Britain to be­come the country with the third­most deaths due to Covid-19, according to data re­leased by the Health Min­istry on Fri­day night.</p>
    <p>Re­ported fa­tal­i­ties rose by 688 from Thurs­day to reach 46,688, the data showed. Britain has 46,204 deaths, according to data com­piled by Johns Hop­kins Uni­ver­sity.</p>
    <p>The high death rate in Mex­ico in­di­cates ac­tual cases may be much higher.</p>
    <p>Mex­ico has been crit­i­cised for its lack of test­ing, leav­ing of­fi­cials with­out in­for­ma­tion about the ill­ness’ spread.</p>
    <p>Pres­i­dent An­dres Manuel Lopez Obrador has largely fo­cused on re­ac­ti­vat­ing the econ­omy over en­act­ing strict lock­downs. He has also down­played the im­por­tance of us­ing masks to slow the virus’ spread.</p>
    <p>In re­marks on July 25, he ac­knowl­edged that the pan­demic has hit the country hard and led to many deaths. He at­trib­uted the toll to the preva­lence of chronic dis­eases such as high blood pres­sure and di­a­betes. Even so, the Pres­i­dent main­tained the spread of the virus is slow­ing.</p>
    <p>Economies have been hit by lock­down re­stric­tions in­tro­duced to re­strict its spread, while many re­gions are fear­ful of a sec­ond wave.</p>
    <p>After some ini­tial progress in con­tain­ing the coron­avirus, Aus­tralia is bat­tling a re­newed out­break in its sec­ond-largest state, Vic­to­ria, that has forced around five mil­lion peo­ple into a six-week lock­down.</p>
    <p>In Vic­to­ria, there was grow­ing con­cern about com­mu­nity trans­mis­sion as the state in re­cent days iden­ti­fied 49 mys­tery cases it could not trace to a known out­break.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, Vic­to­ria re­ported 397 cases of the dis­ease, down by more than a third from Fri­day, but the au­thor­i­ties said they are con­sid­er­ing fur­ther re­stric­tions.</p>
    <p>Three new deaths were also re­ported. This brings the state’s deaths in the pan­demic to 116 and Aus­tralia’s tally to 201.</p>
    <p>“Many coun­tries that be­lieved they were past the worst are now grap­pling with new out­breaks. Some that were less af­fected in the ear­li­est weeks are now see­ing es­ca­lat­ing num­bers of cases and deaths,” said Dr Te­dros.</p>
