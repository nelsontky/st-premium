    <p>A Tem­busu Col­lege don ac­cused of sex­ual mis­con­duct has been sacked by the Na­tional Univer­sity of Sin­ga­pore (NUS).</p>
    <p>In a state­ment yes­ter­day, NUS said it con­ducted an in­ter­nal probe af­ter get­ting two com­plaints al­leg­ing that Tem­busu Col­lege fel­low Jeremy Fer­nando had “be­haved in­ap­pro­pri­ately” as a teach­ing staff mem­ber.</p>
    <p>The find­ings of the probe led to Dr Fer­nando get­ting sacked, the state­ment added.</p>
    <p>An NUS spokesman said: “An in­ter­nal in­ves­ti­ga­tion was car­ried out and Dr Fer­nando’s con­duct was found to have fallen short of the stan­dards of pro­fes­sion­al­ism that the univer­sity ex­pects of teach­ing staff. Based on the find­ings of the in­ter­nal in­ves­ti­ga­tion, Dr Fer­nando, a non­res­i­den­tial teach­ing staff mem­ber, was dis­missed by the univer­sity.”</p>
    <p>NUS is pro­vid­ing sup­port and as­sis­tance to the vic­tims, she added.</p>
    <p>In re­sponse to queries from The Straits Times, the two un­der­grad­u­ate vic­tims, who did not wish to be named, gave de­tails of what Dr Fer­nando al­legedly did to them.</p>
    <p>The first vic­tim, a stu­dent in the res­i­den­tial col­lege, said the ad­vances from Dr Fer­nando be­gan in Oc­to­ber last year and lasted un­til the cir­cuit breaker pe­riod this year.</p>
    <p>She al­leged that Dr Fer­nando made non-con­sen­sual sex­ual ad­vances, such as kiss­ing and grop­ing her, and per­formed oral sex while she was drunk.</p>
    <p>She said: “Through­out these months, he made in­creas­ingly in­for­mal con­tact that grew in in­ten­sity and fre­quency.</p>
    <p>“He also sent many gifts to my house even af­ter I had re­quested him to stop. He pres­sured me into var­i­ous sex­ual acts and dis­cour­aged me from telling my friends.”</p>
    <p>The sec­ond vic­tim said Dr Fer­nando first ap­proached her dur­ing on­line classes this year and pri­vately mes­saged her on Zoom.</p>
    <p>A week af­ter that, they met a male stu­dent for drinks at a restau­rant and went back to her apart­ment.</p>
    <p>She al­leged that while there, Dr Fer­nando tried touch­ing her and kissed her when the male stu­dent was in the toi­let. Af­ter she pulled away, he told her not to tell any­one, and that if she did not keep it a se­cret, he would lose his job, she said.</p>
    <p>Both vic­tims, who met through a mu­tual friend, did not go to the po­lice but re­ported the mat­ter to the col­lege at the be­gin­ning of this se­mes­ter in the hope that oth­ers would not have to go through the same or­deal. They also de­clined to re­veal their ages.</p>
    <p>Both women said their re­port likely led to Dr Fer­nando’s dis­missal, but they are dis­ap­pointed with the lack of com­mu­ni­ca­tion and a state­ment of clar­i­fi­ca­tion from the univer­sity to the stu­dent pop­u­la­tion un­til the is­sue sur­faced on so­cial me­dia.</p>
    <p>Sep­a­rately, a man who said he is an alum­nus of Tem­busu Col­lege, in a Face­book post on Satur­day, said it has been al­most two weeks since the lec­turer was fired, and crit­i­cised the col­lege for its in­ac­tion.</p>
    <p>Mr Gur­prit Singh said: “Tem­busu’s di­rec­tors have been dis­turbingly dis­tant. The vic­tims have been ex­tremely trau­ma­tised through­out the process, the di­rec­tors have re­mained de­tached...</p>
    <p>“It has been al­most two weeks since Jeremy got fired. They have re­sisted mak­ing a clar­i­fy­ing state­ment, and avoided an­swer­ing the vic­tims’ re­quests head-on.”</p>
    <p>In an up­date later, he said the NUS state­ment yes­ter­day did not give de­tails on the na­ture of the cases, the probe’s find­ings or what fur­ther ac­tion NUS plans to take.</p>
    <p>Tem­busu Col­lege is one of four res­i­den­tial col­leges in Univer­sity Town and an ex­ten­sion of the main NUS cam­pus in Kent Ridge.</p>
    <p>The three build­ings of the col­lege house about 600 un­der­grad­u­ates, a small num­ber of grad­u­ate stu­dent ad­vis­ers, as well as res­i­den­tial fel­lows, their fam­i­lies, and guests.</p>
    <p>In April last year, Ms Mon­ica Baey, a third-year NUS com­mu­ni­ca­tions and new me­dia un­der­grad­u­ate, said on In­sta­gram that she was filmed show­er­ing at Eu­soff Hall in Novem­ber 2018.</p>
    <p>She said NUS had asked the per­pe­tra­tor, whom she said was a chem­i­cal en­gi­neer­ing stu­dent, to write an apol­ogy let­ter to her and un­dergo manda­tory coun­selling.</p>
    <p>He was also banned from en­ter­ing Eu­soff Hall and sus­pended from school for a se­mes­ter.</p>
    <p>NUS later con­firmed that the case was in­ves­ti­gated by the po­lice and the man was given a 12-month con­di­tional warn­ing by the au­thor­i­ties.</p>
    <p>In Oc­to­ber 2019, a se­nior lec­turer from NUS who mo­lested an un­der­grad­u­ate on board a cam­pus shut­tle bus was sen­tenced to 14 weeks’ jail.</p>
