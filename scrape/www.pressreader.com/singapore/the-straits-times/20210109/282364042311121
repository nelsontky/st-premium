    <p>Face­book page Comex and IT Show held its first live-stream­ing event of the year on Thurs­day, fea­tur­ing prod­ucts from Sam­sung and bike re­tailer Mobot.</p>
    <p>Thurs­day’s edi­tion of the Live@ComexITSho­w was the first in a se­ries of un­box­ing events that will be streamed on the Face­book page ev­ery first Thurs­day of the month un­til March.</p>
    <p>The live shows got off to a good start at 8pm, with the first one by Sam­sung gar­ner­ing around 3,100 views and 2,600 com­ments as at 9pm.</p>
    <p>Mobot, which hosted the sec­ond live show from 9pm to about 10pm, re­ceived sim­i­lar lev­els of view­er­ship.</p>
    <p>Comex, which drew around 500,000 visi­tors in 2019, is or­gan­ised by Sphere Ex­hibits, the events arm of Sin­ga­pore Press Hold­ings.</p>
    <p>Sphere Ex­hibits also or­gan­ises other con­sumer elec­tron­ics fairs such as the IT Show, the Tech Show and the Con­sumer Elec­tron­ics Ex­hi­bi­tion.</p>
    <p>“In the light of the cur­rent Covid-19 sit­u­a­tion, Comex and IT Show are not held phys­i­cally, and the or­gan­is­ers hope to con­tinue to bring the lat­est tech prod­ucts and gad­gets to the con­sumers in the safety and com­fort of their homes,” said a Sphere Ex­hibits spokesman on Thurs­day.</p>
    <p>View­ers watch­ing the Sam­sung Face­book live show could click on a link posted in the com­ments sec­tion, which would di­rect them to the Best Denki web­site where they could buy the smart TVs.</p>
    <p>For Mobot, view­ers were able to lock in the dis­counted prices on some fold­able bikes, such as those in the Camp Gold range, by plac­ing a $50 de­posit with the re­tailer via PayNow.</p>
    <p>The next two un­box­ing events will take place on Feb 4 and March 4.</p>
