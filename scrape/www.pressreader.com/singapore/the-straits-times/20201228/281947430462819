    </section>

    <p>This is the first ar­ti­cle of a four-part series, The Edges of South-east Asia, that shines a light on the bright spots of cre­ativ­ity and in­no­va­tion in the re­gion. A joint project of Deloitte, the Sin­ga­pore Eco­nomic Devel­op­ment Board and the US-Asean Busi­ness Coun­cil, the ar­ti­cles fo­cus each week on a spe­cific ‘edge’ or cus­tomer seg­ment, geo­graphic mar­ket or prod­uct that of­fers high growth po­ten­tial op­por­tu­ni­ties in Asean. The ex­plo­ration be­gins with the rapidly grow­ing dig­i­tal econ­omy. THE THROW­ING AXE</p>
    <p>It is 10 pm. You are at a Bangkok night mar­ket, throw­ing axes with a client. A fee equiv­a­lent to the price of two Star­bucks Frap­pu­ci­nos gets you one hour of un­lim­ited axe throw­ing – at a tar­get on a wooden board, of course. This isn’t that kind of place.</p>
    <p>The ex­pe­ri­ence, while novel, isn’t new. Axe-throw­ing com­pe­ti­tions, af­ter all, are ru­moured to have orig­i­nated with North Amer­i­can fron­tiers­men, or with the Celts in Europe. There are now axe-throw­ing clubs all over the world. How the prac­tice trav­elled half­way around the world, you will never know.</p>
    <p>This is glob­al­i­sa­tion, you think to your­self as you quaff your Full Moon Cha­lawan beer from a plas­tic cup. This is South-east Asia.</p>
    <p>THE MO­BILE PHONE</p>
    <p>In­ner war­rior pla­cated, you call it a night. The me­dian age of South-east Asia’s pop­u­la­tion is 30 years, but un­like them, you aren’t as young and dy­namic. So you do what ev­ery­one in South-east Asia does when they need some­thing – whip out your mo­bile phone.</p>
    <p>Four hun­dred mil­lion of South-east Asia’s 649 mil­lion pop­u­la­tion are on­line, and 90 per cent of them are mo­bile-first. Many have no desk­top or lap­tops at home. Four out of the world’s top 10 coun­tries by mo­bile In­ter­net us­age are from the re­gion – Thai­land, In­done­sia, Malaysia and the Philip­pines. Some of the most pop­u­lar In­sta­gram and TikTok ex­perts are here.</p>
    <p>At this mo­ment, you’re us­ing your mo­bile to hail a GrabCar – but in South-east Asia, you can also use it for just about ev­ery­thing. It’s not just about so­cial me­dia and e-com­merce. In In­done­sia, you can see the doc­tor on Halodoc, a mo­bile app. It is not just cheaper – 10 min­utes for about US$1 (S$1.35) but it is prob­a­bly the only means for most In­done­sians to see a doc­tor, as traf­fic and large dis­tances make phys­i­cal con­sul­ta­tions im­pos­si­ble. Halodoc now has over 16 mil­lion monthly ac­tive users.</p>
    <p>Else­where, Te-Food, a Viet­namese-Hun­gar­ian joint ven­ture, has de­vel­oped a farm-to-fork, blockchain-based food trace­abil­ity app for pork, chicken, and egg sup­ply chains in Viet­nam; con­sumers scan a QR code on their favourite su­per­mar­ket pro­duce to ver­ify where the food came from. It’s some­thing that might have been hatched by Whole Foods in Austin, Texas – only it was born in Ho Chi Minh City.</p>
    <p>But South-east Asia’s mo­bile fu­ture is no utopia. There is a dig­i­tal di­vide grow­ing be­tween highly con­nected coun­tries, and oth­ers like In­done­sia, Thai­land and Myan­mar with less than 60 per cent In­ter­net pen­e­tra­tion. Within coun­tries, peo­ple in ur­ban ar­eas en­joy more re­li­able In­ter­net con­nec­tions, while ru­ral con­sumers make do with sub-par 3G speeds.</p>
    <p>THE MO­TOR­CY­CLE</p>
    <p>It has been 10 min­utes. Your Grab ride is late. On the su­per­app, you see that your driver hasn’t moved since you last checked.</p>
    <p>This is your first mis­judg­ment of the evening – as­sum­ing that Bangkok traf­fic is like New York. But no. The city’s ar­ter­ies are clogged with in­ter­minable rows of cars, dead ends, and flooded car­riage­ways. Per­haps five more rounds of axe-throw­ing?</p>
    <p>You can­cel the ride and call a GrabBike in­stead. Within min­utes, a mo­tor­cy­cle rider in the fa­mil­iar black and green wind­breaker ap­pears and hands you a hel­met. You strap it on, and soon you are zoom­ing down Royal City Av­enue.</p>
    <p>You are not the only one. There are 20.5 mil­lion reg­is­tered mo­tor­cy­cles in Thai­land – two for every three peo­ple – and many of them are on the streets of Bangkok tonight. This does not sur­prise you, not in South-east Asia, where nine out of 10 house­holds own a mo­tor­cy­cle, and where much of the ur­ban pop­u­la­tion likes to be out and about all night long.</p>
    <p>It is the mo­tor­cy­cle (along­side the mo­bile phone) that pow­ers South-east Asia’s dig­i­tal econ­omy. GoJek, Grab’s big­gest com­peti­tor, was born out of build­ing a ride-hail­ing plat­form for In­done­sia’s ubiq­ui­tous ojek, or mo­tor­cy­cle taxis.</p>
    <p>Like the mo­tor­cy­cle to the fam­ily, ride-hail­ing is merely an en­abler to big­ger things. GoJek is in many busi­nesses, in­clud­ing less in­tu­itive ones, like on-de­mand fa­cials and hairstylin­g. Halodoc, the telemedici­ne startup, now uses GoJek’s mo­tor­cy­cle fleet to de­liver medicine pre­scrip­tions to pa­tients.</p>
    <p>In 2020, one in three dig­i­tal ser­vice con­sumers in South-east Asia were new to the ser­vice due to Covid-19, and ac­cord­ing to Google, Te­masek and Bain, al­most all of th­ese new users will be dig­i­tal users for life.</p>
    <p>The in­ter­ac­tion be­tween on­line and off­line, dig­i­tal and phys­i­cal, is only going to be­come more in­ti­mate in the next few years, mean­ing that the de­mand for mo­tor­cy­cles, much like the driver around whose waist your arms are anx­iously en­sconced, will con­tinue to ac­cel­er­ate.</p>
    <p>THE (E)-WAL­LET</p>
    <p>You ar­rive at your ho­tel, safe and peck­ish. Re­fus­ing to pay “tourist prices” at the ho­tel for a pack of chips, you buy a bowl of Mama In­stant Cup Noo­dles from the mom-and-pop store around the cor­ner. In­stead of hold­ing her hand out for cash, the pro­pri­etor taps her fin­ger on a lam­i­nated sheet of pa­per with a QR code. You know what to do; within sec­onds, you whip out your mo­bile phone, open your su­per­app, and scan the code to pay with your e-wal­let.</p>
    <p>In South-east Asia, e-pay­ments pre­dates Covid-19. Seven out of 10 South-east Asians are ei­ther un­der­banked or un­banked, mean­ing they do not have ac­cess to credit cards, bank ac­counts or other fun­da­men­tal fi­nan­cial ser­vices. While lesser busi­nesses might call this a bar­rier to en­try, many oth­ers call this an op­por­tu­nity.</p>
    <p>Grab and GoJek have been quick­est to re­act. First, they ac­cepted cash pay­ments for ride-hail­ing and other dig­i­tal ser­vices to grow their user base. Then, they cre­ated e-wal­lets within their apps that can be topped up dig­i­tally and with cash at warungs, mom-and-pop stores, and fast-food chains across the re­gion. Fi­nally, with a crit­i­cal mass of con­sumers and cash, they started of­fer­ing pay­ments-ad­ja­cent ser­vices such as peer-to-peer funds trans­fer, re­mit­tance, mi­cro-loans, in­surance and even op­tions to in­vest in third-party funds.</p>
    <p>Many of th­ese ser­vices are of­fered in col­lab­o­ra­tion with fi­nan­cial in­sti­tu­tions like DBS Bank, China’s Zhong An, and Kasiko­rn­bank (Thai­land’s fourth-largest bank). In fact, Gojek just be­came a 22 per cent share­holder of tech­nol­ogy-based Bank Jago, so now GoJek users in­stantly have a bank ac­count with Jago and ac­cess to cap­i­tal.</p>
    <p>The trend is com­ing to a head in Sin­ga­pore, which has just is­sued four dig­i­tal bank li­cences, three of which went to con­sor­tiums led by tech com­pa­nies, in­clud­ing Alibaba’s Ant Fi­nan­cial Group. Soon, th­ese com­pa­nies will be of­fer­ing fi­nan­cial ser­vices to un­der­served con­sumer and small and medium-sized busi­ness seg­ments.</p>
    <p>If suc­cess­ful, they will scale th­ese ser­vices to the rest of South-east Asia, mean­ing greater ac­cess to pre­cious seed cap­i­tal, which could re­sult in more Halodocs or Te-Foods. Be­yond that, greater ac­cess to credit means more con­sumer pur­chases of mo­bile phones, mo­tor­cy­cles, and other ob­jects that al­low them to par­tic­i­pate in the growth of South-east Asia’s dig­i­tal de­vel­op­ing econ­omy.</p>
    <p>Even pur­vey­ors of in­stant noo­dles stand to ben­e­fit. Com­pa­nies like Growsari in the Philip­pines and Warung Pin­tar in In­done­sia are mod­ernising mom-and-pop stores, start­ing with e-pay­ments, but mov­ing quickly into dig­i­tal pro­cure­ment sys­tems, free Wi-Fi for cus­tomers, and more.</p>
    <p>This is the se­cret sauce in South-east Asia’s dig­i­tal growth recipe, and one of the big­gest op­por­tu­ni­ties in the re­gion.</p>
    <p>THE BEER</p>
    <p>You want one more beer to cool your­self down be­fore you turn in for the night. Blame the spicy basil-flavoured noo­dles.</p>
    <p>In the mom-and-pop store, you spot what looks like a growler of the ex­cel­lent Full Moon Cha­lawan you had at the night mar­ket. You whip out your e-wal­let again with­out a se­cond look, and within min­utes, you’re back in your ho­tel room, ready for your night­cap.</p>
    <p>To your sur­prise, though, what you thought was a Thai craft beer is in fact an Ore­go­nian IPA.</p>
    <p>Per­haps this is what’s truly unique here – the un­ex­pected con­nec­tions be­tween South-east Asia and the world. This is how the re­gion will suc­ceed – by tak­ing ad­van­tage of th­ese con­nec­tions to close the dig­i­tal di­vide, solve ex­ist­ing so­cio-eco­nomic prob­lems, and tackle emerg­ing ones like sus­tain­able and green growth.</p>
    <p>Maybe some of the in­no­va­tors of the world are, like your­self, al­ready in the re­gion mak­ing th­ese con­nec­tions.</p>
    <p>Mi­croloans on your mo­bile phone; medicine de­liv­ered by mo­tor­cy­cle; beer drink­ing and axe-throw­ing in a night mar­ket. This is glob­al­i­sa­tion. This is South-east Asia.</p>

        <p data-role="text">It is the mo&#xAD;tor&#xAD;cy&#xAD;cle (along&#xAD;side the mo&#xAD;bile phone) that pow&#xAD;ers South-east Asia&#x2019;s dig&#xAD;i&#xAD;tal econ&#xAD;omy. GoJek, Grab&#x2019;s big&#xAD;gest com&#xAD;peti&#xAD;tor, was born out of build&#xAD;ing a ride-hail&#xAD;ing plat&#xAD;form for In&#xAD;done&#xAD;sia&#x2019;s ubiq&#xAD;ui&#xAD;tous ojek, or mo&#xAD;tor&#xAD;cy&#xAD;cle taxis. Like the mo&#xAD;tor&#xAD;cy&#xAD;cle to the fam&#xAD;ily, ride-hail&#xAD;ing is merely an en&#xAD;abler to big&#xAD;ger things, and GoJek is in many busi&#xAD;nesses.</p>
