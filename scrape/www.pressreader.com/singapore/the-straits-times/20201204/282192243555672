    <p>When she was 15, Ms Sher­ena Loh was di­ag­nosed with mus­cu­lar dys­tro­phy. Doc­tors told her that she would not live past 25.</p>
    <p>But she did, and has spent much of her life cham­pi­oning causes for the dis­abil­ity com­mu­nity. In 2000, she co-founded the Mus­cu­lar Dys­tro­phy As­so­ci­a­tion (Sin­ga­pore) (MDAS).</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, Ms Loh, 61, was one of four UBS Achieve­ment award win­ners at the Goh Chok Tong En­able Awards.</p>
    <p>As a child, Ms Loh fre­quently fell due to de­clin­ing mus­cle func­tion brought about by her con­di­tion.</p>
    <p>“Fall­ing be­came my great­est fear as I had dif­fi­culty get­ting up on my own. It was not just about phys­i­cal in­jury or pain... (It) also im­pacted me emo­tion­ally and psy­cho­log­i­cally,” said Ms Loh.</p>
    <p>Once, in her early 20s, she en­coun­tered a large pack of dogs.</p>
    <p>“In my fear, my legs turned soft and I fell. Two peo­ple that I spot­ted ig­nored my cries for help. One dog came near me and I sensed a sym­pa­thetic look in his eyes. Then he left.</p>
    <p>“In that mo­ment, I won­dered why this dog showed more sym­pa­thy than peo­ple. This spurred me to be an ac­tive vol­un­teer for per­sons with phys­i­cal dis­abil­i­ties.”</p>
    <p>Ms Loh vol­un­teered with the Hand­i­caps Wel­fare As­so­ci­a­tion for some years be­fore co-found­ing MDAS, where she is now a di­rec­tor.</p>
    <p>MDAS started as a sup­port group for per­sons with mus­cu­lar dys­tro­phy and their fam­i­lies, and has evolved into a “skills for life” cen­tre, with cour­ses for those af­flicted by the con­di­tion.</p>
    <p>Ms Loh has long-term plans for MDAS, such as open­ing a respite care cen­tre where peo­ple can stay for a short time and ben­e­fit from a com­bi­na­tion of ac­tiv­i­ties and care. This would also give care­givers a much­needed break.</p>
    <p>On re­ceiv­ing the UBS Achieve­ment award, Ms Loh said: “I be­lieve the award can bring for­ward pos­i­tive sto­ries to en­cour­age peo­ple with spe­cial abil­i­ties as well as the pub­lic.</p>
    <p>“I hope to con­tinue to give a voice to those bat­tling se­vere rare dis­eases, beyond just mus­cu­lar dys­tro­phy, be­cause they de­serve to live a life with dig­nity.”</p>
