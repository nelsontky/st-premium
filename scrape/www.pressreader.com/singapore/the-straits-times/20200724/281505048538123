    <p>Out­go­ing Trans­port Min­is­ter Khaw Boon Wan has dengue, his of­fice said yes­ter­day af­ter­noon.</p>
    <p>It is the third time he has been stricken with the mos­quito-borne dis­ease. His first brush with the virus was in the 1980s.</p>
    <p>Mr Khaw, 67, also had a swab test for Covid-19, and the re­sult was neg­a­tive. He is cur­rently warded in Sin­ga­pore Gen­eral Hos­pi­tal.</p>
    <p>He posted on Face­book yes­ter­day morn­ing that he had been ad­mit­ted to an iso­la­tion ward for ob­ser­va­tion af­ter de­vel­op­ing a fever.</p>
    <p>Spec­u­lat­ing on his con­di­tion then, he said: “Un­likely to be Covid but dengue is pos­si­ble as my area is a hot zone. Did the swab test just now and hope­fully it is a false alarm. I had dengue be­fore, and it was not pleas­ant.</p>
    <p>“Mean­while, I will just let the body rest and think about re­tire­ment!” said Mr Khaw, who an­nounced be­fore the re­cent gen­eral elec­tion that he would be re­tir­ing from pol­i­tics.</p>
    <p>Mr Khaw lives in the Yio Chu</p>
    <p>Kang area, which has parts listed by the Na­tional En­vi­ron­ment Agency as red zones. Red zones are high­risk ar­eas with 10 or more cases.</p>
    <p>He only re­cently fi­nalised ne­go­ti­a­tions for the Jo­hor Baru-Sin­ga­pore Rapid Tran­sit Sys­tem (RTS), and was look­ing for­ward to the sign­ing cer­e­mony.</p>
    <p>He said that he had also been pre­par­ing his of­fice for the next trans­port min­is­ter.</p>
    <p>Mr Khaw main­tained his sense of hu­mour in his post­ing, de­scrib­ing a selfie he took with a nasal tube at­tached as “hi­lar­i­ous”.</p>
    <p>He was a civil ser­vant in the Health Min­istry in the 1970s and 1980s, and se­nior min­is­ter of state for health dur­ing the se­vere acute res­pi­ra­tory syn­drome (Sars) out­break in 2003. He was ap­pointed health min­is­ter the next year.</p>
    <p>Learn­ing from the painful lessons of Sars, he in­sti­tuted new pro­cesses and ex­ten­sive prepa­ra­tions to ready Sin­ga­pore for the next novel dis­ease out­break, which Prime Min­is­ter Lee Hsien Loong said have “served us well when Covid-19 came upon us”.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore’s dengue out­break has con­tin­ued to surge, with the num­ber of i nfec­tions top­ping 1,000 cases for the sixth con­sec­u­tive week.</p>
    <p>There were 1,733 in­fec­tions di­ag­nosed last week, 65 more than the pre­vi­ous week.</p>
    <p>Un­til this year, the high­est weekly in­fec­tion num­ber was 891, in 2014. As of 3pm on Wed­nes­day, there have been 954 in­fec­tions di­ag­nosed this week since Sun­day.</p>
    <p>There are now 424 ac­tive dengue clus­ters con­cen­trated mostly in the east­ern part of the coun­try.</p>
    <p>Nine­teen peo­ple have died of dengue so far this year, one fewer than the 20 deaths recorded in all of 2019.</p>
