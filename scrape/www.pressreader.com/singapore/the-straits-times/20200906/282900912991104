    <p>The Ke­bun Baru Void Deck WiFi Project, set up by the char­ity Be­yond So­cial Ser­vices, is a fine ex­am­ple of alert­ness to hid­den needs in so­ci­ety. The char­ity’s ini­tia­tive has brought re­lief to low-in­come homes in sev­eral blocks that now en­joy In­ter­net ac­cess with the in­stal­la­tion of high­speed fi­bre broad­band at the void deck. What is par­tic­u­larly com­mend­able is that Be­yond So­cial Ser­vices went be­yond ad­dress­ing vis­i­ble so­cial needs, which char­i­ties do gen­er­ally, to fo­cus on the vul­ner­a­bil­i­ties of those who might not be able to af­ford ac­cess to Wi-Fi, one of the most tak­en­for-granted as­pects of ev­ery­day life in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>Most Sin­ga­pore­ans would find it dif­fi­cult to be­lieve that there are some among them who func­tion with­out such ac­cess when Sin­ga­pore’s achieve­ments as a dig­i­tal so­ci­ety are recog­nised in­ter­na­tion­ally. The recog­ni­tion is ap­pro­pri­ate be­cause dig­i­tal­i­sa­tion en­hances the qual­ity of per­sonal, so­cial and eco­nomic life.</p>
    <p>How­ever, the dig­i­tal di­vide is a real threat as well. Ad­dress­ing it rests not only on the Govern­ment but also on all those who be­lieve in so­cial in­clu­sive­ness as the key to na­tional re­silience. Bad times amplify the need for cor­rec­tive ac­tion. The am­bit of that ac­tion re­quires ini­tia­tives from the ground up in which ac­tive cit­i­zens part­ner the Govern­ment in com­ing up with so­lu­tions to prob­lems or is­sues that they en­counter around them.</p>
    <p>Ex­am­ples in­clude the Youth Men­tal Well-be­ing</p>
    <p>Net­work, Al­liances for Ac­tion – in­dus­try-led coali­tions in the eco­nomic do­main that aim to quickly de­velop and test new ideas of growth – and the Be­yond Covid-19 Task­force, a new ac­tion net­work for the so­cial sec­tor.</p>
    <p>In their dif­fer­ent spheres, they ex­tend the agenda of so­cial ac­tion be­yond what the Govern­ment does. Char­i­ties and other groups won’t be able to match the state’s fi­nan­cial and bu­reau­cratic re­sources, but they can com­ple­ment them.</p>
