    <p>WASH­ING­TON Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump may with­draw nearly all Amer­i­can troops from So­ma­lia as part of a global pull­back that in­cludes re­duc­tions of forces in Afghanista­n and Iraq, US of­fi­cials have said.</p>
    <p>The of­fi­cials said noth­ing had been fi­nalised and that no or­ders for So­ma­lia have been re­ceived by the US mil­i­tary.</p>
    <p>But there ap­peared to be a grow­ing ex­pec­ta­tion that draw­down or­ders would be com­ing soon.</p>
    <p>The Pen­tagon on Tues­day an­nounced that Mr Trump will re­duce US forces in Afghanista­n from 4,500 to 2,500 by Jan 15, just five days be­fore his term ends, and cut US forces in Iraq by 500 to the same level.</p>
    <p>The US has about 700 troops in</p>
    <p>So­ma­lia fo­cused on help­ing lo­cal forces de­feat the Al-Qaeda-linked al Shabaab in­sur­gency. The mis­sion gets lit­tle at­ten­tion in the US but is con­sid­ered a corner­stone of the Pen­tagon’s global ef­forts to com­bat Al-Qaeda.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump’s newly-in­stalled Act­ing De­fence Sec­re­tary Christo­pher Miller, a for­mer Green Beret and counter-ter­ror­ism of­fi­cial, is tak­ing a hard look at So­ma­lia and could opt for keep­ing a min­i­mal US troop pres­ence there and stop re­ly­ing on large de­ploy­ments to com­bat al Shabaab.</p>
    <p>Mr Nathan Sales, the State Depart­ment’s counter-ter­ror­ism co­or­di­na­tor, on Tues­day de­clined to dis­cuss plans for US forces in So­ma­lia.</p>
    <p>But he noted that al Shabaab poses a dan­ger to East Africa’s se­cu­rity and that the group has staged at­tacks in Kenya.</p>
    <p>“Al Shabaab con­tin­ues to pose a sig­nif­i­cant threat in­side So­ma­lia and in­creas­ingly in the re­gion,” Mr Sales told re­porters while an­nounc­ing the black­list­ing of two of the group’s lead­ers.</p>
    <p>“The United States takes se­ri­ously our re­spon­si­bil­i­ties to use what tools are avail­able to us to roll­back, de­grade and de­feat this dan­ger­ous ter­ror­ist group.”</p>
    <p>Crit­ics say a rad­i­cal change in US pol­icy to­wards al Shabaab car­ries a sig­nif­i­cant risk.</p>
    <p>Colonel Ahmed Ab­dul­lahi Sheikh, who served for three years as the com­man­der of the Danab spe­cial forces un­til last year, said any de­ci­sion to pull back would not be based on the counter-ter­ror­ism threat in So­ma­lia but could un­der­mine trust in the US.</p>
    <p>“This is be­ing dic­tated by pol­i­tics,” he said.</p>
    <p>The US had al­ready pulled out of So­ma­lia’s Bos­saso and Galkayo around three weeks ago.</p>
    <p>Amer­i­can troops re­main in the south­ern port city of Kis­mayo, a spe­cial forces air base in Bale­dogle and in the cap­i­tal Mo­gadishu, but a rapid pull­out risks ced­ing ground to al Shabaab, Col Sheikh said.</p>
    <p>“It would cre­ate a vac­uum. The So­mali se­cu­rity forces have good morale be­cause of the US troops… there’s the pos­si­bil­ity of air sup­port if they are at­tacked, they can have mede­vacs,” Col Sheikh pointed out.</p>
    <p>So­ma­lia has been riven by civil war since 1991, but over the past decade, the African Union-backed peace­keep­ing force has clawed back con­trol of the cap­i­tal and large swathes of the coun­try from al Shabaab.</p>
