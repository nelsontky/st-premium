    <p>Chi­nese so­cial me­dia erupted in a mix­ture of glee and schaden­freude yes­ter­day as a mob stormed the United States Capi­tol, com­par­ing the chaos with anti-gov­ern­ment protests in Hong Kong in 2019.</p>
    <p>Hard-core sup­port­ers of US Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump on Wed­nes­day broke into the build­ing in Wash­ing­ton to protest against his elec­tion de­feat, ran­sack­ing parts of it while scuf­fling with se­cu­rity per­son­nel. Many took self­ies which were widely shared on so­cial me­dia.</p>
    <p>The may­hem re­sem­bled that in Hong Kong on July 1, 2019, when pro­test­ers laid siege to the Leg­isla­tive Coun­cil com­plex, van­dal­is­ing and ran­sack­ing the main cham­ber.</p>
    <p>The Chi­nese For­eign Min­istry also drew par­al­lels with Hong Kong, which has re­mained a sore point in re­la­tions with Amer­ica, ac­cus­ing the US of dou­ble stan­dards.</p>
    <p>“Some peo­ple in the United States have very dif­fer­ent re­ac­tions and words about what hap­pened in Hong Kong in 2019 and what is hap­pen­ing in the United States to­day,” For­eign Min­istry spokesman Hua Chun­y­ing said at a reg­u­lar press brief­ing in Bei­jing yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>“This sharp con­trast and the rea­sons be­hind it are thought-pro­vok­ing and wor­thy of ev­ery­one’s con­sid­er­a­tion.”</p>
    <p>In a pinned tweet on its page, state-backed tabloid Global Times shared a se­ries of im­ages con­trast­ing the storm­ing of the Capi­tol with what oc­curred in Hong Kong in July 2019.</p>
    <p>“@Speak­erPelosi once re­ferred to the Hong Kong ri­ots as ‘a beau­ti­ful sight to be­hold’ – it re­mains yet to be seen whether she will say the same about the re­cent de­vel­op­ments in Capi­tol Hill,” the news­pa­per tweeted, tag­ging the Speaker of the US House of Rep­re­sen­ta­tives, Mrs Nancy Pelosi.</p>
    <p>The Com­mu­nist Youth League also de­scribed the ri­ots as a “beau­ti­ful sight” on its Weibo ac­count.</p>
    <p>On the Twit­ter-like Weibo, the hash­tag “Trump sup­port­ers storm Capi­tol” racked up 580 mil­lion views, with many la­belling the may­hem in Wash­ing­ton as “pay­back” for what they said was US in­ter­fer­ence in Hong Kong.</p>
    <p>“The most beau­ti­ful scenery in the world,” read one com­ment with 4,600 views.</p>
    <p>“Pelosi can en­joy the beau­ti­ful sight – even at her of­fice desk!” another ne­ti­zen wrote.</p>
    <p>“For such a long time, US politi­cians called riot­ers ‘free­dom fight­ers’ in other coun­tries. Now, they fi­nally have retri­bu­tion!”</p>
    <p>Mean­while, world lead­ers and gov­ern­ments on Wed­nes­day ex­pressed shock and out­rage at the vi­o­lent events in Wash­ing­ton.</p>
    <p>Bri­tish Prime Min­is­ter Boris John­son con­demned on Twit­ter the “dis­grace­ful scenes” in the US Congress, adding that “it is now vi­tal that there should be a peace­ful and or­derly trans­fer of power”.</p>
    <p>French Pres­i­dent Em­manuel Macron said in a video mes­sage on Twit­ter that “what hap­pened to­day in Wash­ing­ton, DC is not Amer­i­can, def­i­nitely.”</p>
    <p>“We be­lieve in the strength of our democ­ra­cies. We be­lieve in the strength of Amer­i­can democ­racy,” he added, speak­ing in English.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, United Na­tions Sec­re­tary-Gen­eral An­to­nio Guter­res was “sad­dened” by the events, his spokesman said.</p>
    <p>“In such cir­cum­stances, it is im­por­tant that po­lit­i­cal lead­ers im­press on their fol­low­ers the need to re­frain from vi­o­lence, as well as to re­spect demo­cratic pro­cesses and the rule of law,” UN spokesman Stephane Du­jar­ric said.</p>
    <p>Ger­man Chan­cel­lor An­gela Merkel was “fu­ri­ous and sad­dened” by the ac­tions of sup­port­ers of Mr Trump, and said the Pres­i­dent shared blame for the un­rest.</p>
    <p>“Doubts about the elec­tion out­come were stoked and cre­ated the at­mos­phere that made the events of last night pos­si­ble,” she said.</p>
    <p>Cana­dian Prime Min­is­ter Justin Trudeau said: “Vi­o­lence will never suc­ceed in over­rul­ing the will of the peo­ple. Democ­racy in the US must be up­held – and it will be.”</p>
    <p>In­dia’s Prime Min­is­ter Naren­dra Modi said he was “dis­tressed to see news about ri­ot­ing and vi­o­lence”.</p>
    <p>“Or­derly and peace­ful trans­fer of power must con­tinue. The demo­cratic process can­not be al­lowed to be sub­verted through un­law­ful protests,” he tweeted.</p>
    <p>COM­PAR­ING HK AND U.S.</p>
    <p>Some peo­ple in the United States have very dif­fer­ent re­ac­tions and words about what hap­pened in Hong Kong in 2019 and what is hap­pen­ing in the United States to­day.</p>
    <p>CHINA’S FOR­EIGN MIN­ISTRY SPOKESMAN HUA CHUN­Y­ING DEMOC­RACY WILL HOLD OUT</p>
    <p>Vi­o­lence will never suc­ceed in over­rul­ing the will of the peo­ple. Democ­racy in the US must be up­held – and it will be.</p>
