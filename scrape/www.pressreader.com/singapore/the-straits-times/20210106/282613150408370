    <p>Aries (March 21 - April 19)</p>
    <p>You can get what you want – but use your charm, rather than your bold­ness. If you smile sweetly, you can get quite a lot more out of peo­ple than if you snarl.</p>
    <p>Tau­rus (April 20 - May 20)</p>
    <p>En­list a friend in your quest for health. You are not the only one who wants to eat bet­ter and ex­er­cise more, and it is eas­ier if you have a buddy.</p>
    <p>Gem­ini (May 21 - June 20)</p>
    <p>Your en­ergy is fo­cused on some­one close: a ro­man­tic part­ner, col­league or friend. You can be in­tense some­times, but it should work out great.</p>
    <p>Can­cer (June 21 - July 22)</p>
    <p>This is not the best day to try to make se­ri­ous progress at school or work – things are bumpy and you are bet­ter off pur­su­ing low-stress in­ter­ests.</p>
    <p>Leo (July 23 - Aug 22)</p>
    <p>You should have some se­ri­ous clout when it comes to per­suad­ing folks to see things your way – that is, the right way. It may start to feel spooky.</p>
    <p>Virgo (Aug 23 - Sept 22)</p>
    <p>You have to deal with some lit­tle set­backs – so get ready for them. The first might come early, but the rest should be much eas­ier to deal with.</p>
    <p>Li­bra (Sept 23 - Oct 22)</p>
    <p>The day brings a wave of calm­ing en­ergy that helps you sort ev­ery­thing out per­fectly. It is a good time to set an ex­am­ple, es­pe­cially for chil­dren.</p>
    <p>Scor­pio (Oct 23 - Nov 21)</p>
    <p>This is a bet­ter time for thought than for ac­tion. You may feel pres­sured to move quickly, but slow down and con­sider ev­ery an­gle be­fore you move for­ward.</p>
    <p>Sagit­tar­ius (Nov 22 - Dec 21)</p>
    <p>Things are go­ing well, but you can im­prove them with a few well-placed words. A quick e-mail or im­promptu meet­ing can make a dif­fer­ence.</p>
    <p>Capri­corn (Dec 22 - Jan 19)</p>
    <p>Things are still pretty tricky around the of­fice or at home and you need to make sure you are not rock­ing the boat.</p>
    <p>You should find a mid­dle path.</p>
    <p>Aquar­ius (Jan 20 - Feb 18)</p>
    <p>Reach out even if you want to with­draw. Things are not go­ing your way, but if you get the right peo­ple on your side, then mo­men­tum car­ries you all the way.</p>
    <p>Pisces (Feb 19 - March 20)</p>
    <p>You could drive your­self crazy if you think too hard about what peo­ple owe you. Do not worry too much – in fact, for­give­ness is the best course of ac­tion.</p>
