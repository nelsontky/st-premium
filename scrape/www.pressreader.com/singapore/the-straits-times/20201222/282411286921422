    <p>More le­gal woes are likely on the cards for the founder of in­sol­vent Hin Leong Trad­ing and his two chil­dren, who are now bat­tling a grow­ing num­ber of law­suits by bank cred­i­tors try­ing to re­cover more than US$3.5 bil­lion (S$4.7 bil­lion) from the firm.</p>
    <p>This is af­ter Price­wa­ter­house­Coop­ers (PwC) Ad­vi­sory Ser­vices, the ju­di­cial man­ager of the oil trad­ing gi­ant, filed suit to force oil ty­coon Lim Oon Kuin, bet­ter known as OK Lim, and his two chil­dren to re­pay the US$3.5 bil­lion debt and US$90 mil­lion in div­i­dends that they al­legedly paid them­selves even though their com­pany was in­sol­vent.</p>
    <p>PwC al­leged that they breached their fidu­ciary du­ties as di­rec­tors and en­gaged in fraud­u­lent trad­ing.</p>
    <p>Fol­low­ing PwC’s suit, HSBC, Hin Leong’s largest cred­i­tor with about US$600 mil­lion ow­ing, took le­gal ac­tion against the fam­ily, fol­lowed by Bank of China.</p>
    <p>One of Sin­ga­pore’s big­gest cases of cor­po­rate fraud and breaches of ac­count­ing reg­u­la­tions, the Hin Leong scan­dal came to light ear­lier this year amid an un­prece­dented col­lapse in global oil prices as the Covid-19 pan­demic swept across the globe and a price war broke out be­tween Saudi Ara­bia and Rus­sia.</p>
    <p>Hin Leong’s foun­da­tions be­gan crum­bling when banks, spooked by de­faults at other trad­ing houses like Agri­trade In­ter­na­tional, be­gan with­draw­ing credit lines. Com­pound­ing the firm’s liq­uid­ity crunch was the oil price rout. Hin Leong had not suf­fi­ciently hedged against this and, as a re­sult, was forced to sell its in­ven­tory to meet mar­gin calls by nu­mer­ous banks.</p>
    <p>“At the same time, the trade fi­nanc­ing loans ex­tended by the banks for Hin Leong’s pur­chase of cargo in the pre­ced­ing weeks be­came due. Hav­ing de­pleted its cash re­serves to an­swer mar­gin calls, Hin Leong sim­ply did not have the funds to pay th­ese loans,” Lim re­vealed in court doc­u­ments filed in April.</p>
    <p>Even worse for the banks, he said Hin Leong sold some of the in­ven­tory the com­pany had pledged as col­lat­eral for its loans, and used the pro­ceeds as gen­eral funds “even though the in­ven­tory was the sub­ject of in­ven­tory fi­nanc­ing agree­ments with banks”. He added that he “told (his fi­nance depart­ment) that (he) would be re­spon­si­ble if any­thing went wrong”.</p>
    <p>Hin Leong’s trou­bles es­ca­lated with a probe by the Sin­ga­pore po­lice and in­creased scru­tiny by sev­eral reg­u­la­tors. In ad­di­tion to Hin Leong, two other com­pa­nies re­lated to the Lim fam­ily are now un­der in­terim ju­di­cial man­age­ment. They are Hin Leong ship­ping arm Ocean Tankers and Xihe Hold­ings, which is owned by Lim and his son, Mr Evan Lim Chee Meng.</p>
    <p>In Au­gust, a day af­ter the in­terim ju­di­cial man­agers of Xihe were ap­pointed, Lim was charged with one count of abet­ment of forgery for the pur­pose of cheat­ing re­lat­ing to a fake China Avi­a­tion Oil (Sin­ga­pore) Cor­po­ra­tion (CAO) cargo sale. This was fol­lowed by an ad­di­tional charge in Septem­ber.</p>
    <p>HSBC took le­gal ac­tion against the Lim fam­ily and a Hin Leong em­ployee af­ter the two crim­i­nal charges were brought against the elder Lim, as the fake CAO cargo sale is also the sub­ject of the bank’s suit. HSBC al­leged that the de­fen­dants “fraud­u­lently de­ceived” it into lend­ing Hin Leong US$111.7 mil­lion by sign­ing forged in­voices that were sub­mit­ted to ob­tain dis­count fi­nanc­ing ear­lier this year.</p>
    <p>But in his de­fence pa­pers, the elder Lim de­nied the al­le­ga­tions. In his de­fence fil­ings to the PwC suit, he has dis­avowed his af­fi­davit filed on April 17, in which he al­leged that pay­ments made to sat­isfy mar­gin calls were re­flected as “ac­counts re­ceiv­ables” in the fi­nan­cial state­ments.</p>
    <p>When asked about his state­ment in his April af­fi­davit, he said “his high­est level of ed­u­ca­tion is Sec­ondary 2 and as he is not trained to read fi­nan­cial state­ments, he does not even know what ‘ac­counts re­ceiv­ables’ are”.</p>
