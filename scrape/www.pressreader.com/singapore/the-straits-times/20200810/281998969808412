    <p>My fel­low Sin­ga­pore­ans, Every year, rain or shine, Sin­ga­pore­ans come to­gether on the 9th of Au­gust for the Na­tional Day Pa­rade (NDP), to cel­e­brate the mak­ing of our na­tion, and re­new our com­mit­ment to Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>I have been priv­i­leged to at­tend al­most every NDP since the first in 1966. One of the Pa­rades I took part in was in 1968 at the Padang. The rain poured down, but the con­tin­gents stood steady, and marched past proudly, drenched, yet un­daunted. We showed our­selves and the world that Sin­ga­pore­ans were rugged peo­ple, and had the steel in us to stand firm in ad­ver­sity.</p>
    <p>Five years ago, SG50 was another mem­o­rable Pa­rade. We cel­e­brated our Golden Ju­bilee, and what we had achieved in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>We also paid trib­ute to our found­ing Prime Min­is­ter, Mr Lee Kuan Yew. We mourned his pass­ing that year, but also af­firmed what he and the pioneer lead­ers stood for.</p>
    <p>In good years, our Pa­rades re­joice in our progress, and look for­ward to a bet­ter fu­ture to­gether.</p>
    <p>In dif­fi­cult years, we still hold Na­tional Day Pa­rades, to re­new our re­solve to weather the storm and take Sin­ga­pore through to bet­ter days.</p>
    <p>This year, Na­tional Day falls amidst Covid-19. We are not able to cel­e­brate in our usual way, but we are de­ter­mined still to hold the Pa­rade as a sym­bol of our unity as a na­tion, like we have done every year since in­de­pen­dence. We will have a smaller Pa­rade at the Padang, and also cer­e­monies at seven other lo­ca­tions around the is­land this morn­ing. Each lo­ca­tion will sym­bol­ise one as­pect of our re­sponse to Covid-19 – pro­vid­ing med­i­cal care for Sin­ga­pore­ans at NCID; sup­port­ing our work­force with skills and jobs at the Life­long Learn­ing In­sti­tute; keep­ing learn­ing go­ing for our stu­dents at North Vista Sec­ondary School; or sus­tain­ing our com­mu­nity spirit at Kam­pung Ad­mi­ralty.</p>
    <p>We look for­ward to Sin­ga­pore­ans across the is­land, and also in far-flung lands, join­ing the Pa­rade vir­tu­ally and cel­e­brat­ing with one another. We will all share spe­cial mo­ments like when the Red Lions land, the mobile col­umn reaches our town, or the State Flag is flown past. We will all re­cite the Pledge and sing Ma­ju­lah Sin­ga­pura in our hearts to­gether.</p>
    <p>STO­RIES OF EV­ERY­DAY HEROES</p>
    <p>This NDP is also an op­por­tu­nity for us to salute those on our front line, fight­ing Covid-19.</p>
    <p>Many of them have gone way be­yond the call of duty, and shown great gen­eros­ity of spirit. Re­tired doc­tors and nurses vol­un­teered to come back, don­ning PPE to serve on the front lines, in hospi­tals and mi­grant worker dor­mi­to­ries. Full-time na­tional ser­vice­men ex­tended their terms to con­tinue sup­port­ing Covid-19 oper­a­tions. Public of­fi­cers vol­un­teered to be re­de­ployed to or­gan­ise and look af­ter the mi­grant work­ers.</p>
    <p>Many Sin­ga­pore­ans stepped up to help oth­ers in need. Some went door to door dis­tribut­ing meals and gro­ceries to the el­derly and low-in­come house­holds. Oth­ers re­fur­bished do­nated lap­tops for needy stu­dents, for home-based learn­ing. Thou­sands of public-spir­ited Sin­ga­pore­ans vol­un­teered to be trained for swab oper­a­tions. They served in the hot zones, in­clud­ing the dor­mi­to­ries and com­mu­nity care fa­cil­i­ties. Mi­grant work­ers too played their part to sup­port th­ese oper­a­tions. Their help was deeply ap­pre­ci­ated by our SAF, Home Team and public of­fi­cers.</p>
    <p>Th­ese self­less acts have made all the dif­fer­ence to our re­sponse to Covid-19.</p>
    <p>BRAC­ING OUR­SELVES FOR ECO­NOMIC DIF­FI­CUL­TIES AHEAD</p>
    <p>We will need this unity and re­silience more than ever. The cri­sis is far from over.</p>
    <p>Many coun­tries brought Covid-19 un­der con­trol and eased re­stric­tions, only to see their cases rise sharply again. This can hap­pen to us too, de­spite all our pre­cau­tions. It will most likely take a year or two be­fore a vac­cine is widely avail­able, and the threat of the virus is blunted. Un­til then, we have to main­tain our vig­i­lance and re­solve, to keep our­selves, our loved ones and our neigh­bours all safe.</p>
    <p>We also need to be re­silient in the face of the se­vere eco­nomic down­turn.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore­ans are un­der­stand­ably anx­ious and wor­ried. Busi­ness clo­sures, re­trench­ments and un­em­ploy­ment are all likely to go up in the com­ing months.</p>
    <p>But this is not the first eco­nomic cri­sis we have ex­pe­ri­enced. Just in the last quar­ter cen­tury, we have seen the Asian Fi­nan­cial Cri­sis (1997-1998), the af­ter­math of the 9/11 ter­ror­ist at­tacks (2001), and the Global Fi­nan­cial Cri­sis (2007-2009). Each time the out­look was omi­nous, and we feared the worst, but each time we worked hard to se­cure our po­si­tion, grit­ted our teeth, and came through to­gether.</p>
    <p>I am con­fi­dent we will get through this cur­rent cri­sis too, though it may take longer. All of us must do our part, but none of us will be alone. The Govern­ment is ac­tively help­ing peo­ple find new jobs and ac­quire new skills.</p>
    <p>We also have the Jobs Sup­port Scheme and Self-em­ployed Per­son In­come Re­lief Scheme to ease the bur­den on em­ploy­ers and in­di­vid­u­als. The Labour Move­ment is work­ing with em­ploy­ers to cre­ate job train­ing pro­grammes and ca­reer path­ways. It will also en­sure that every worker is treated fairly and with dig­nity, es­pe­cially when job losses can­not be avoided. Em­ploy­ers too must make every ef­fort to keep their work­ers, and not drop them at the first sign of trouble. This will build loy­alty, and en­cour­age the em­ploy­ees to help their em­ploy­ers re­build when con­di­tions im­prove.</p>
    <p>Our ex­pe­ri­ence fight­ing Covid-19, grim and hard as it has been, has brought us closer to­gether. The shared or­deal will toughen a whole pop­u­la­tion, and bond us to­gether as one united peo­ple. Just like how the Pioneer and Merdeka Gen­er­a­tions were tem­pered by Sep­a­ra­tion and In­de­pen­dence, and eco­nomic crises in our early years as a na­tion.</p>
    <p>Let us brace our­selves for the tri­als ahead, so that many years from now, when our grand­chil­dren cel­e­brate Na­tional Day, they will look back on th­ese times and say: yes, this gen­er­a­tion stood to­gether, sac­ri­ficed for one another, and built Sin­ga­pore for us.</p>
    <p>NS SQUARE</p>
    <p>Every Na­tional Day, we re­mind our­selves that Sin­ga­pore is a na­tion whose story is worth cel­e­brat­ing, whose his­tory is worth cher­ish­ing, and whose fu­ture is worth build­ing.</p>
    <p>When we hold the Na­tional Day Pa­rade at the Padang, or at the Float@Ma­rina Bay, the au­di­ence can see the Ma­rina Bay sky­line in the back­ground. Ma­rina Bay used to be open sea, but we re­claimed the land around it, turned the ocean into a reser­voir, and pro­gres­sively built on the new land, to cre­ate an out­stand­ing and vibrant down­town. Look­ing out across the Bay, you can im­me­di­ately see how far Sin­ga­pore has come, and imag­ine the pos­si­bil­ity and prom­ise that Sin­ga­pore holds.</p>
    <p>To­day, when Na­tional Ser­vice re­cruits com­plete their Ba­sic Mil­i­tary Train­ing, they gather their fam­i­lies and friends at the Float and hold their pass­ing out pa­rade there. It helps them to un­der­stand what they are de­fend­ing, and why gen­er­a­tions of na­tional ser­vice­men have been will­ing to serve and sac­ri­fice, to de­fend this me­trop­o­lis that we have built to­gether, and also the so­ci­ety that cre­ated all this: Our fam­i­lies. Our friends. Our lives. Our fu­ture.</p>
    <p>Three years ago, I an­nounced that we would re­build the Float into a per­ma­nent space to com­mem­o­rate Na­tional Ser­vice (NS), and the cen­tral role that NS plays in Sin­ga­pore, and that we would name this space, NS Square.</p>
    <p>The de­sign con­tract has been awarded.</p>
    <p>The de­vel­op­ment will be aligned on a cen­tral axis, with The Promon­tory on the op­po­site side of the Bay. The plat­form will be­come a red dot, shin­ing bright in our city. NS Square will be the cen­tral fo­cus of our new down­town. We will build a gallery there to show­case our Na­tional Ser­vice story, and hon­our the con­tri­bu­tions of na­tional ser­vice­men past and present.</p>
    <p>NS Square will also be a com­mu­nity space for ev­ery­one, young and old, to en­joy. And of course, we will con­tinue to hold our Na­tional Day Pa­rades there.</p>
    <p>CON­CLU­SION</p>
    <p>This Na­tional Day, as we cel­e­brate across the is­land, we will be say­ing the Pledge and singing Ma­ju­lah Sin­ga­pura in uni­son – not aloud as usual be­cause of Covid-19, but in our hearts, with more feel­ing than ever.</p>
    <p>We have dreams to re­alise, and goals to reach for. Let us show the world that what­ever the chal­lenges, Sin­ga­pore­ans will stay united, and pre­vail once more.</p>
    <p>I wish ev­ery­one a very happy Na­tional Day!</p>
