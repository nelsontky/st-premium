    <p>Re­trench­ments more than dou­bled in the sec­ond quar­ter of this year, with 6,700 work­ers laid off, up from 3,220 in the first quar­ter.</p>
    <p>More work­ers are ex­pected to lose their jobs for the rest of this year as the re­ces­sion deep­ens.</p>
    <p>Here is what you should know if you are re­trenched:</p>
    <p>Q What are the rights of a re­trenched worker?</p>
    <p>A There are three ques­tions on rights that all re­trenched work­ers should ask.</p>
    <p>One: Is it re­ally a re­trench­ment? The Em­ploy­ment Act de­fines re­trench­ment as “dis­missal on the ground of re­dun­dancy or by rea­son of any re­or­gan­i­sa­tion of the em­ployer’s pro­fes­sion, busi­ness, trade or work”.</p>
    <p>This means that an em­ployer can re­trench work­ers only un­der cer­tain con­di­tions, such as if the com­pany is re­struc­tur­ing or the jobs are no longer there af­ter busi­ness has dwin­dled.</p>
    <p>Em­ploy­ers are gen­er­ally cut­ting costs dur­ing the cur­rent re­ces­sion, but not all cost-cut­ting ex­er­cises are nec­es­sar­ily re­trench­ments.</p>
    <p>For ex­am­ple, if an em­ployer pro­poses to work­ers that they vol­un­tar­ily take a pay cut to keep their jobs and a worker is re­luc­tant to do so, the em­ployer can­not re­trench the worker who re­fuses a vol­un­tary pay cut. To let the worker go, the em­ployer has to abide by the con­di­tions of the con­tract or the Em­ploy­ment Act, or both.</p>
    <p>At the same time, there may also be em­ploy­ers that dis­guise re­trench­ments as some­thing else, such as dis­missals, to avoid pay­ing re­trench­ment ben­e­fits.</p>
    <p>On this prac­tice, Man­power Min­is­ter Josephine Teo said in Par­lia­ment in June that an em­ployee is pre­sumed to have been re­trenched if the em­ployer can­not show a plan to fill the va­cancy any time soon.</p>
    <p>She added that an em­ployer can­not side­step the obli­ga­tion to pay re­trench­ment ben­e­fits by call­ing the re­trench­ment some­thing else.</p>
    <p>She also warned: “If a com­pany is found to have dis­guised their re­trench­ments, the MOM (Min­istry of Man­power) can and will con­sider with­draw­ing govern­ment sup­port like the Jobs Sup­port Scheme and sus­pend­ing their work pass priv­i­leges.”</p>
    <p>Two: Has the em­ployer given enough no­tice?</p>
    <p>The Em­ploy­ment Act stip­u­lates min­i­mum no­tice pe­ri­ods that em­ploy­ers are re­quired to give when they ter­mi­nate the em­ploy­ment of their work­ers.</p>
    <p>These no­tice pe­ri­ods ap­ply to re­trench­ments too, al­though an em­ployer can pay the re­trenched worker a quan­tum, such as an amount equiv­a­lent to the worker’s pay for the no­tice pe­riod, in lieu of the no­tice.</p>
    <p>Three: Am I en­ti­tled to re­trench­ment pay­ments?</p>
    <p>Yes, but only for work­ers who have worked with the em­ployer for two years or more. This is spelt out in the Em­ploy­ment Act.</p>
    <p>For those who have worked for the em­ployer for less than two years, it is up to the com­pany to make a good­will pay­ment.</p>
    <p>Re­trenched work­ers who are preg­nant are also en­ti­tled to ma­ter­nity ben­e­fits if they have worked for the em­ployer for at least three months and were cer­ti­fied by a doc­tor to be preg­nant be­fore re­ceiv­ing the pink slip.</p>
    <p>Q How much does my em­ployer owe me in re­trench­ment pay­outs?</p>
    <p>A In some cases, it may be noth­ing.</p>
    <p>While the law says that a worker who has worked with an em­ployer for at least two years is eli­gi­ble for re­trench­ment pay­outs, it does not state that the em­ployer must pay such ben­e­fits to the re­trenched worker.</p>
    <p>In other words, Singapore does not have a leg­is­lated manda­tory re­trench­ment ben­e­fits scheme.</p>
    <p>If the pay­ment or amount of re­trench­ment ben­e­fits is not spelt out in the union’s col­lec­tive agree­ment with the com­pany or the work­ers’ in­di­vid­ual con­tracts, then it is up to the com­pany to de­cide how much to pay, if at all.</p>
    <p>MOM says that al­though re­trench­ment ben­e­fits are not man­dated by law, it strongly en­cour­ages em­ploy­ers to ad­here to the min­istry’s ad­vi­sories to pro­vide re­trench­ment ben­e­fits, de­pend­ing on their fi­nan­cial po­si­tion.</p>
    <p>For unionised work­ers, the amount of re­trench­ment ben­e­fits de­pends on what is in the col­lec­tive agree­ment.</p>
    <p>The pre­vail­ing norm is to pay a re­trench­ment ben­e­fit of be­tween two weeks’ and one month’s salary for each year of ser­vice, de­pend­ing on the fi­nan­cial po­si­tion of the com­pany.</p>
    <p>An MOM sur­vey pub­lished in Septem­ber 2018 found that 90 per cent of em­ploy­ers who re­trenched work­ers in 2017 paid re­trench­ment ben­e­fits and 94 per cent of re­trenched lo­cal work­ers who were eli­gi­ble for re­trench­ment ben­e­fits re­ceived them.</p>
    <p>The same sur­vey found two com­mon rea­sons why some em­ploy­ers did not pay such ben­e­fits: There were no such pro­vi­sions in the work­ers’ em­ploy­ment con­tracts, and fi­nan­cial con­straints.</p>
    <p>The sec­ond rea­son is worth not­ing now. The coro­n­avirus pan­demic and re­ces­sion would have weak­ened the fi­nan­cial po­si­tions of many em­ploy­ers in Singapore and af­fected their abil­ity to pay re­trench­ment ben­e­fits.</p>
    <p>Q If I think I have been short­changed, who can I turn to?</p>
    <p>A Re­trenched work­ers in unionised com­pa­nies can turn to their unions for help, al­though the chances of such com­pa­nies short­chang­ing their re­trenched work­ers are sig­nif­i­cantly lower.</p>
    <p>Last month, three unions threat­ened to go on strike to pre­vent air­craft main­te­nance, re­pair and over­haul firm Ea­gle Ser­vices Asia from go­ing ahead with planned re­trench­ments uni­lat­er­ally.</p>
    <p>The strikes were averted af­ter the com­pany backed down, cor­rected its re­trench­ment process and reached an am­i­ca­ble agree­ment with the unions.</p>
    <p>Union mem­bers in nonunionis­ed com­pa­nies can ap­proach the Na­tional Trades Union Congress, or NTUC (call 6213-8008).</p>
    <p>Other work­ers can ap­proach MOM (call 6438-5122, e-mail: mom_l­rwd@mom.gov.sg).</p>
    <p>The min­istry may in turn di­rect the work­ers to make their claims for re­trench­ment ben­e­fits through the Tri­par­tite Al­liance for Dis­pute Man­age­ment, which con­ducts me­di­a­tion for such claims.</p>
    <p>Q How do I look for a new job?</p>
    <p>A A good place to start is the net­work of SGUnited Jobs and Skills Cen­tre run by Work­force Singapore.</p>
    <p>There are now over 20 such cen­tres (www.wsg.gov.sg/sgu­js­cen­tre. html) found mostly in com­mu­nity clubs, and they are open daily ex­cept on pub­lic hol­i­days.</p>
    <p>The staff in these cen­tres are trained to help re­trenched work­ers find jobs and train­ing op­por­tu­ni­ties.</p>
    <p>NTUC also runs the Em­ploy­ment and Em­ploy­a­bil­ity In­sti­tute (e2i), with two cen­tres in Jurong East and Toa Payoh that help re­trenched work­ers find jobs.</p>
    <p>Some 92,000 jobs, trainee­ship and at­tach­ment op­por­tu­ni­ties were avail­able as of the end of last month. Seven in 10 of these po­si­tions are pro­fes­sional, man­age­rial, ex­ec­u­tive and tech­ni­cian roles, MOM has said.</p>
    <p>About half of these jobs are govern­ment-funded, heav­ily sub­sidised trainee­ship and at­tach­ment op­por­tu­ni­ties, or hir­ing that was brought for­ward by pub­lic sec­tor agen­cies, while some 42,000 po­si­tions are of­fered by pri­vate-sec­tor em­ploy­ers, with the bulk of those be­ing long-term roles.</p>
    <p>MOM has also started pub­lish­ing weekly job sit­u­a­tion re­ports to pro­vide in­for­ma­tion on the grow­ing sec­tors that are hir­ing.</p>
