    <p>WASH­ING­TON • The United States Capi­tol Po­lice said that of­fi­cer Brian Sick­nick died due to in­juries sus­tained in re­sponse to the riot at the home of Congress.</p>
    <p>“Of­fi­cer Sick­nick was re­spond­ing to the riot on Wed­nes­day, Jan 6, 2021, at the US Capi­tol and was in­jured while phys­i­cally en­gag­ing with pro­test­ers,” the po­lice said in a state­ment, adding that he died on Thurs­day night.</p>
    <p>“He re­turned to his di­vi­sion of­fice and col­lapsed. He was taken to a lo­cal hos­pi­tal, where he suc­cumbed to his in­juries,” the state­ment said. Lo­cal me­dia re­ported that Mr Sick­nick, 40, was a 15-year vet­eran of the force.</p>
    <p>He was said to have suf­fered a stroke ear­lier and was on life sup­port be­fore his death.</p>
    <p>Metropoli­tan homi­cide of­fi­cials will in­ves­ti­gate the death of Mr Sick­nick, who joined the US Capi­tol Po­lice in 2008, along with the Capi­tol force and its fed­eral part­ners, po­lice said.</p>
    <p>More than 50 po­lice of­fi­cers were in­jured when an an­gry mob of Trump sup­port­ers swarmed the bar­ri­cades around the Capi­tol on Wed­nes­day, spray­ing chem­i­cal ir­ri­tants and wield­ing lead pipes. Mr Sick­nick was the fifth per­son who had died in con­nec­tion with the storm­ing of the Capi­tol.</p>
    <p>A woman iden­ti­fied as Ms Ashli Bab­bitt was fa­tally shot by a Capi­tol Po­lice of­fi­cer. An­other woman and two men died dur­ing the events be­cause of med­i­cal emer­gen­cies. They were iden­ti­fied as Ms Rosanne Boy­land, 34; Mr Kevin Gree­son, 55; and Mr Ben­jamin Phillips, 50.</p>
    <p>Po­lice said Ms Boy­land, from Ge­or­gia, was “crushed” dur­ing the chaos. Her fam­ily later said that she was “tram­pled in the Ro­tunda” of the Capi­tol build­ing.</p>
    <p>Mr Gree­son was said to have died from a heart at­tack. His wife said he had trav­elled to Wash­ing­ton from Alabama to sup­port Mr Trump and that his death was not re­lated to ri­ot­ing.</p>
    <p>“Kevin had a his­tory of high blood pres­sure, and in the midst of the ex­cite­ment, suf­fered a heart at­tack,” Mrs Kristi Gree­son told The Wash­ing­ton Post.</p>
    <p>Mr Phillips had trav­elled from Penn­syl­va­nia with fel­low Trump sup­port­ers. Po­lice re­port­edly said Mr Phillips had suf­fered a stroke and died at a hos­pi­tal.</p>
