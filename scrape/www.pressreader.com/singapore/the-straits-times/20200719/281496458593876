    <p>In 1980, when Sin­ga­pore was still a devel­op­ing coun­try, its pop­u­la­tion was 2.4 mil­lion. Sup­pose the gov­ern­ment of the day had an­nounced a tar­get for the pop­u­la­tion to more than dou­ble to 5.7 mil­lion by 2019, what would the pub­lic re­ac­tion have been?</p>
    <p>More than a few peo­ple would have been hor­ri­fied. How would Sin­ga­pore, with its lim­ited space, be able to ac­com­mo­date such an in­crease, it would be asked.</p>
    <p>How would the pub­lic trans­port sys­tem (then com­pris­ing mainly buses) cope? Where would the ad­di­tional peo­ple be housed?</p>
    <p>What would hap­pen to jobs and wages? Wouldn’t av­er­age in­comes go down?</p>
    <p>De­vel­op­ment ex­perts might also have raised con­cerns. It was the re­ceived wis­dom that pop­u­la­tion growth, espe­cially in devel­op­ing coun­tries, was one of the big­gest causes of poverty. A few years ear­lier, Mr Robert McNa­mara, then pres­i­dent of the World Bank, had pro­nounced: “To put it sim­ply, the great­est sin­gle ob­sta­cle to the eco­nomic and so­cial ad­vance­ment of the ma­jor­ity of peo­ples in the un­der­de­vel­oped world is ram­pant pop­u­la­tion growth.”</p>
    <p>As we know, Sin­ga­pore’s pop­u­la­tion did in­deed in­crease from 2.4 mil­lion in 1980 to</p>
    <p>5.7 mil­lion by 2019. But over the same pe­riod, per capita in­come rose from about US$4,900 to US$65,000 (S$90,500), a level higher than Aus­tralia, Bri­tain and Ja­pan, among other coun­tries that were pre­vi­ously richer.</p>
    <p>In other words, while pop­u­la­tion in­creased by around 2.4 times, the av­er­age in­come per head rose by more than 13 times, and Sin­ga­pore tran­si­tioned from the devel­op­ing world into the ranks of the ad­vanced economies. It main­tained close to full em­ploy­ment for most of the 40-year pe­riod, other than brief re­ces­sions in 1985, 1998, 2001 and 2008, and even had labour short­ages from time to time.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore was not the only coun­try that ex­pe­ri­enced ris­ing pros­per­ity as its pop­u­la­tion rose. While it is a par­tic­u­larly strik­ing ex­am­ple – even more so if we go back to the 1960s – the same is true of much of Europe and the Amer­i­cas as they be­came more pros­per­ous, and large parts of Asia. Even rel­a­tively poor and al­legedly over­pop­u­lated coun­tries like In­dia and In­done­sia have seen in­creases in per capita in­come that have far ex­ceeded their pop­u­la­tion growth, which has now slowed to around 1 per cent.</p>
    <p>AG­GLOM­ER­A­TION EF­FECTS</p>
    <p>It is also no ac­ci­dent that some of the world’s densely pop­u­lated economies – such as Bel­gium, the Nether­lands, Hong Kong, Ja­pan, Tai­wan and South Korea – are rel­a­tively wealthy, while many with sparse pop­u­la­tions are rel­a­tively poor. This is also true of re­gions within coun­tries. Eco­nomic research has shown that dense pop­u­la­tions cre­ate what ur­ban econ­o­mists call “ag­glom­er­a­tion ef­fects” – that is, clus­ters of eco­nomic ac­tiv­ity, syn­er­gies and knowl­edge spillovers.</p>
    <p>Of course, all of this does not mean that fur­ther in­creases in pop­u­la­tion would be suf­fi­cient to guar­an­tee greater pros­per­ity – other con­di­tions would also need to be met. But it does sug­gest that we should not think about pop­u­la­tion growth me­chan­i­cally, in terms of the amount of land or phys­i­cal cap­i­tal per head or un­der the as­sump­tion that such things as land use and in­fra­struc­ture re­main frozen in time, or that tech­no­log­i­cal change doesn’t ex­ist.</p>
    <p>It also sug­gests that we should not ex­trap­o­late that the fu­ture will be like the present, only with more peo­ple. That is not how eco­nomic re­al­ity turns out.</p>
    <p>Those who were around in 1980 would re­mem­ber that Sin­ga­pore’s in­fra­struc­ture was far be­hind what it is to­day. Large parts of the city were un­de­vel­oped – there were still pig farms in Pung­gol, rub­ber es­tates in Sem­bawang and Tampines had just started be­ing trans­formed from forests and sand quar­ries into a res­i­den­tial es­tate. Many of to­day’s HDB towns didn’t ex­ist.</p>
    <p>There was no MRT, no Ma­rina Bay, no Raf­fles City, no sub­ur­ban malls to speak of. Ex­press­ways such as the AYE, CTE, BKE, TPE, KPE, SLE and KJE hadn’t been started. Changi Air­port’s soli­tary ter­mi­nal was in the fi­nal stages of con­struc­tion. Many of to­day’s pop­u­lar tourist attraction­s like the in­te­grated re­sorts, Gar­dens by the Bay, the Night Sa­fari, Boat Quay and Clarke Quay were not even dreamed of. In­ter­na­tional restau­rants were rel­a­tively few and far be­tween, and the arts scene was a shadow of what it is to­day.</p>
    <p>Among in­dus­tries, Sin­ga­pore had not yet moved into elec­tron­ics or phar­ma­ceu­ti­cals, which were later to be­come the main­stays of the man­u­fac­tur­ing sec­tor. Jurong Is­land, which be­came the heart of Sin­ga­pore’s chem­i­cal and en­ergy in­dus­tries, was nowhere on the hori­zon and no­body talked much about R&D. Tourism – mea­sured by vis­i­tor ar­rivals – was about one-eighth of what it was in 2019.</p>
    <p>The ex­ter­nal en­vi­ron­ment was also quite dif­fer­ent. No­tably, China was still a poor coun­try – its eco­nomic re­forms had only just started, In­dia suf­fered from low growth and the economies of</p>
    <p>Asean were not as dy­namic as they later be­came.</p>
    <p>The eco­nomic trans­for­ma­tion of Sin­ga­pore would not have been pos­si­ble with­out an in­crease in pop­u­la­tion. With­out Sin­ga­pore be­ing able to pro­vide the req­ui­site work­force – both lo­cal and for­eign, com­pa­nies (both lo­cal and for­eign) would not have been able to in­vest in Sin­ga­pore or ex­pand or up­grade their op­er­a­tions here, and this is true of ev­ery in­dus­try and al­most all ser­vices. In other words, with­out the in­crease in pop­u­la­tion, Sin­ga­pore would not have been able to move into the ranks of ad­vanced economies. This is worth re­mem­ber­ing.</p>
    <p>A HOT-BUT­TON IS­SUE</p>
    <p>The ques­tion now is where we go from here. Pop­u­la­tion has been a hot-but­ton is­sue, espe­cially af­ter the re­lease of the Pop­u­la­tion White Pa­per of 2013, but much of the de­bate has been about num­bers. Dur­ing the re­cent elec­tion cam­paign, some mem­bers of the op­po­si­tion ac­cused the Peo­ple’s Ac­tion Party (PAP) of “toy­ing with the idea” of a 10 mil­lion pop­u­la­tion, forc­ing the PAP to point out that it had done no such thing.</p>
    <p>For many Sin­ga­pore­ans, a pop­u­la­tion of 10 mil­lion in the fu­ture sounds scary – prob­a­bly even more scary than a pop­u­la­tion of 5.7 mil­lion would have sounded in 1980 – which is per­haps one rea­son why some politi­cians de­cided to raise the is­sue.</p>
    <p>But fix­at­ing on a num­ber – any num­ber – is mis­guided. The only sen­si­ble an­swer to the ques­tion “how many peo­ple can Sin­ga­pore sup­port?” is “it de­pends”.</p>
    <p>As the past has demon­strated, it de­pends on Sin­ga­pore’s ca­pac­ity to ex­pand its health, ed­u­ca­tion and trans­port in­fra­struc­ture as well as its hous­ing stock, its abil­ity to con­tinue at­tract­ing in­vest­ments, the na­ture of those in­vest­ments, the kind of in­dus­tries that come up in the fu­ture, the ex­tent of au­to­ma­tion and in­no­va­tion, the state of tech­nol­ogy and ex­ter­nal mar­ket con­di­tions.</p>
    <p>It also de­pends on the de­mo­graphic pro­file of the pop­u­la­tion, so­ci­ety’s readi­ness to tol­er­ate greater diver­sity and what trade-offs peo­ple are will­ing to ac­cept – for ex­am­ple, in terms of ris­ing pros­per­ity on the one hand and the di­lu­tion of iden­tity on the other.</p>
    <p>In short, it’s a com­pli­cated ques­tion with no easy an­swers. Sin­ga­pore’s plan­ners in 1980 did not set any pop­u­la­tion tar­get – it was busi­ness-friendly poli­cies, eco­nomic growth, changes in the ex­ter­nal en­vi­ron­ment, the in­flux of in­vest­ments and the ex­pan­sion of in­fra­struc­ture that both ne­ces­si­tated and ac­com­mo­dated the more than dou­bling of the pop­u­la­tion be­tween then and now.</p>
    <p>The chal­lenges of the fu­ture will of course be dif­fer­ent from those of the past. The Covid-19 pan­demic has trig­gered a global re­ces­sion.</p>
    <p>But look­ing be­yond, economies will re­cover, and tech­no­log­i­cal changes are likely to ac­cel­er­ate – which Sin­ga­pore is well po­si­tioned to deal with.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore can also take some com­fort in the fact that it is at the heart of what will re­main the fastest-grow­ing re­gion of the world. These de­vel­op­ments, as well as do­mes­tic poli­cies and pol­i­tics, will de­ter­mine what Sin­ga­pore’s labour needs will be.</p>
    <p>THE DE­MO­GRAPHIC CHAL­LENGE</p>
    <p>But there is one is­sue that looms large, which was ab­sent in the 1980s, and that is de­mo­graph­ics.</p>
    <p>Those who pro­pose easy an­swers to the pop­u­la­tion is­sue by stip­u­lat­ing a num­ber at which a pop­u­la­tion should be “capped” – espe­cially at a level not far from where it is to­day – have an obli­ga­tion to ex­plain how they plan to raise the fer­til­ity rate (the av­er­age num­ber of chil­dren born per woman) which has been fall­ing since 2014 to 1.14 last year, which is well be­low the re­place­ment rate (the rate re­quired to main­tain the pop­u­la­tion at a con­stant level) of 2.1 and how fast they will be able to do it.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, they must ex­plain how they will deal with the is­sue of the de­cline of the work­ing pop­u­la­tion from this year on­wards – some 900,000 baby boomers are ex­pected to re­tire be­tween now and 2030. How do they plan to plug such a huge gap in the labour force, espe­cially if they frown on im­mi­gra­tion? None of these is­sues was raised in the con­text of the pop­u­la­tion de­bate dur­ing the cam­paign by those who cited big, scary-sound­ing num­bers.</p>
    <p>The pop­u­la­tion is­sue will not go away even if its brief mo­ment as an elec­tion cam­paign is­sue is over. It will need to be dis­cussed, and when it is, the dis­cus­sion will hope­fully be about more than pick­ing a num­ber.</p>
