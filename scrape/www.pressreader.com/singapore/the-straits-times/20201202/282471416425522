    <p>LON­DON New­cas­tle United’s Premier League fix­ture at As­ton Villa on Fri­day is un­der i ncreas­ing threat of be­ing post­poned as the club at­tempt to deal with a coro­n­avirus out­break.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to The Guardian, Steve Bruce’s en­tire first-team squad were asked to self-iso­late on Mon­day, while their train­ing ground was closed and will not re­open till to­day at the ear­li­est.</p>
    <p>Bruce had said on the eve of last Fri­day’s 2-0 league win at Crys­tal Palace that three un­named in­di­vid­u­als at the club were self-iso­lat­ing af­ter test­ing pos­i­tive.</p>
    <p>Two more in­di­vid­u­als have since tested pos­i­tive af­ter the l at­est round of test­ing on Sun­day, tak­ing the to­tal num­ber of cases within the club to five – re­port­edly four play­ers and one mem­ber of Bruce’s staff.</p>
    <p>The New­cas­tle boss had can­celled a planned train­ing ses­sion on Sun­day morn­ing and or­dered a deep clean of New­cas­tle’s train­ing ground.</p>
    <p>An­other round of test­ing is due to take place to­day, ac­cord­ing to Sky Sports. Af­ter the Palace win, Bruce said he was “a lit­tle bit anx­ious” about the sit­u­a­tion and con­cerned for the wel­fare of not only his play­ers but also the sup­port staff around them.</p>
    <p>“It’s a con­cern and dif­fi­cult to man­age. We’re try­ing our ut­most to make sure we try and stay as safe as we can,” he told Sky Sports af­ter the Palace match.</p>
    <p>“Of course my con­cern isn’t just the wel­fare of the play­ers, which is vi­tally im­por­tant, but my mem­bers of staff too.</p>
    <p>“We’ll do our best but it’s dif­fi­cult at the mo­ment.”</p>
    <p>Mid­fielder Isaac Hay­den missed that match with ill­ness, while cap­tain Ja­maal Las­celles, winger Al­lan Saint-Max­imin, striker Andy Car­roll and de­fender Emil Krafth were re­ported in­jured.</p>
    <p>With the train­ing ground shut, all phys­io­ther­apy treat­ment has also been sus­pended.</p>
    <p>Should the Villa game be post­poned upon New­cas­tle’s re­quest, it would be the first Premier League fix­ture to be de­layed due to the coro­n­avirus this sea­son.</p>
    <p>The league, how­ever, is re­sis­tant to the idea of post­pone­ment.</p>
    <p>The au­thor­i­ties have said pre­vi­ously that for a game to be post­poned, it would re­quire 14 play­ers to be af­fected.</p>
    <p>But, if the team are able to field 11 play­ers and three sub­sti­tutes the game should go ahead.</p>
    <p>The fix­ture sched­ule is al­ready hec­tic with teams ex­pe­ri­enc­ing a higher-than-usual rate of in­juries.</p>
    <p>Bruce is also un­der­stood to be con­cerned that play­ers who have not trained prop­erly be­fore the match could be at ad­di­tional risk of in­jury.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to The Telegraph, the pos­si­bil­ity of the play­ers turn­ing</p>
    <p>STEVE BRUCE, New­cas­tle man­ager.</p>
    <p>up solely for train­ing to­day with­out en­ter­ing the build­ings is be­ing con­sid­ered.</p>
    <p>The English top flight as a whole recorded 10 pos­i­tive coro­n­avirus tests over the last week, up by two cases from the pre­vi­ous week.</p>
    <p>The city of New­cas­tle it­self will en­ter the Tier 3 band to­day when the lock­down ends – the high­est al­lo­cated by the Bri­tish gov­ern­ment.</p>
    <p>Of course my con­cern isn’t just the wel­fare of the play­ers... but my mem­bers of staff too. We’ll do our best but it’s dif­fi­cult at the mo­ment.</p>
