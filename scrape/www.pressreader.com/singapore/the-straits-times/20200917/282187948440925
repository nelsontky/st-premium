    <p>It is heart­en­ing to read about the lat­est steps that will be taken to ease the di­vorce process, in par­tic­u­lar for those with­out le­gal rep­re­sen­ta­tion (On­line por­tal to ease process of un­con­tested divorces: CJ, Sept 15).</p>
    <p>For some time, “ther­a­peu­tic jus­tice” has been just a buzz­word, but with train­ing planned for fam­ily court judges and le­gal prac­ti­tion­ers, it is fi­nally tak­ing shape.</p>
    <p>Fam­ily law, un­like other ar­eas of law, deals with the most in­ti­mate fab­ric of in­di­vid­u­als’ lives, many of whom, such as lit­tle chil­dren, will not even get their voices heard but are the ones who will be most im­pacted in a di­vorce.</p>
    <p>In the face of the pan­demic, Chief Jus­tice Sun­daresh Menon pru­dently pointed out the need to recon­cep­tu­alise fam­ily jus­tice.</p>
    <p>I would urge the courts to go a step fur­ther and take a longer-term view so that the sys­tems we are ex­per­i­ment­ing with now, such as vir­tual hear­ings, will still have a place when the pan­demic ends.</p>
    <p>The pan­demic has com­pelled us to think cre­atively about how we do things, and we should not waste the lessons learnt.</p>
    <p>Rather than merely graft­ing tech­nol­ogy onto our old ways, the think­ing process should go be­yond au­to­ma­tion of tra­di­tional ways so that ac­cess to jus­tice can be truly en­hanced.</p>
    <p>It is im­per­a­tive that the courts waste no time in gath­er­ing feed­back from court users who have had a taste of vir­tual hear­ings.</p>
    <p>Such in­put could be in­valu­able as we con­tem­plate the de­sign of a fu­ture sys­tem that could re­place one that re­mains too costly, time con­sum­ing and un­in­tel­li­gi­ble for the lay­man.</p>
    <p>I be­lieve our vi­sion­ary court sys­tem can blaze a trail and take the lead by show­ing our le­gal prac­ti­tion­ers that the courts ex­ist to en­sure the de­liv­ery of jus­tice to all in need and not sim­ply those who can af­ford it.</p>
