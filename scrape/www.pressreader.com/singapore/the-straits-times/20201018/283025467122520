    <p>Blood flowed on the streets of New Delhi dur­ing the Fe­bru­ary ri­ots, as Hin­dus and Mus­lims at­tacked each other. A young in­ter­faith cou­ple in the city wit­nessed the events un­fold with hor­ror. But this ex­plo­sion of vi­o­lence did not weaken their re­solve to marry each other.</p>
    <p>Ms Nida Rehman, a 26-year-old Mus­lim, and Mr Mo­han Lal, a 28-year-old Hindu, had de­cided to get mar­ried af­ter they met and fell in love in 2011 while they were univer­sity stu­dents.</p>
    <p>Ms Rehman still con­sid­ers their mar­riage as a “bloom­ing flower” that could soothe re­la­tions be­tween the two com­mu­ni­ties.</p>
    <p>“The child that will come into our house will be­come fa­mil­iar with both Hin­duism and Is­lam and grow to re­spect both re­li­gions,” she told The Sun­day Times.</p>
    <p>But In­dia, po­larised along re­li­gious lines, has been a hos­tile flowerbed for such in­ter­faith unions that at­tract cen­sure, not just from the lovers’ fam­i­lies, but also so­ci­ety at large.</p>
    <p>Ms Rehman walked out of her par­ent’s house in Au­gust – they wanted Mr Lal to con­vert to Is­lam – and moved into a flat that the young cou­ple rented. She did so af­ter spend­ing a few days un­der the pro­tec­tion of Dhanak of Hu­man­ity, a not-for-profit or­gan­i­sa­tion that coun­sels in­ter­faith as well as in­ter­caste cou­ples and of­fers them tem­po­rary refuge.</p>
    <p>The cou­ple has taken the bat­tle to the Delhi High Court, seek­ing to over­haul a law they be­lieve dis­crim­i­nates against in­ter­faith cou­ples.</p>
    <p>On Sept 21, they filed a pe­ti­tion against the 1954 Spe­cial Mar­riage Act (SMA), which re­quires an in­ter­faith cou­ple seek­ing to marry to is­sue a no­tice to a lo­cal govern­ment “mar­riage of­fi­cer” in a district where at least one of them has lived for 30 days or more prior to is­su­ing their no­tice. This no­tice must con­tain pri­vate de­tails such as names, ad­dresses and pho­to­graphs of the cou­ple and has to be dis­played in a “con­spic­u­ous place” in the mar­riage of­fi­cer’s of­fice.</p>
    <p>This is done so that any­body – not just fam­ily or rel­a­tives – who wishes to ob­ject to the mar­riage can do so.</p>
    <p>Any ob­jec­tion is then in­quired into by the of­fi­cer and the mar­riage is not solem­nised un­til he is sat­is­fied that the ob­jec­tion lacks merit or un­less it is with­drawn. Cou­ples who share the same faith but want to have a sec­u­lar mar­riage un­der the SMA must also fol­low the same process.</p>
    <p>Ms Rehman be­lieves in­ter­faith cou­ples face a greater risk of ha­rass­ment from un­co­op­er­a­tive govern­ment of­fi­cials and strangers af­ter their pri­vate de­tails are made pub­lic through such no­tices, es­pe­cially by those who wish to ex­ploit these re­la­tion­ships for po­lit­i­cal gains.</p>
    <p>Her pe­ti­tion calls for Sec­tions 6 and 7 of the SMA, which lay out this process of invit­ing pub­lic ob­jec­tions, to be scrapped. It claims these sec­tions vi­o­late an in­di­vid­ual’s fun­da­men­tal rights, in­clud­ing the right to pri­vacy.</p>
    <p>Ms Rehman ap­plied last month to the lo­cal mar­riage of­fi­cer to marry un­der the SMA, but is still wait­ing to hear when her 30-day no­tice pe­riod to regis­ter her mar­riage starts.</p>
    <p>In­ter­faith cou­ples have of­ten been vic­tims of ha­rass­ment across In­dia, even lead­ing to “hon­our killings” and sui­cide in many cases.</p>
    <p>A 23-year-old Hindu man was mur­dered not far from his house in Delhi in 2018 by the fam­ily of the Mus­lim girl she was dat­ing.</p>
    <p>In cases where the woman is a Hindu and the man a Mus­lim, ac­cu­sa­tions of “love ji­had” fur­ther ag­gra­vate com­mu­nal ten­sion. The term is used by rad­i­cal Hindu groups to ac­cuse Mus­lim men of par­tic­i­pat­ing in a planned con­spir­acy to con­vert Hindu women to Is­lam by se­duc­ing them.</p>
    <p>But the SMA lays down spe­cific grounds for ob­jec­tion.</p>
    <p>Nei­ther party to a pro­posed mar­riage should have a liv­ing spouse nor should they suf­fer from any “un­sound­ness of mind” that ren­ders them in­ca­pable of giv­ing valid con­sent. They should also not suf­fer from a “men­tal dis­or­der” that makes them un­fit for mar­riage or “pro­cre­ation of chil­dren”.</p>
    <p>There have been grow­ing calls for SMA re­form in re­cent years. In 2018, the Law Com­mis­sion of In­dia rec­om­mended that the 30-day pe­riod be re­duced to “bring the pro­ce­dure in line” with Hindu and Mus­lim mar­riage laws that en­able cou­ples to regis­ter their mar­riage in a day. Be­tween Jan­uary and Septem­ber last year in New Delhi, 461 mar­riages were reg­is­tered un­der the SMA, com­pared with 13,572 un­der the Hindu Mar­riage Act.</p>
    <p>Mr Asif Iqbal, who co-founded Dhanak of Hu­man­ity in 2005, said that the ha­rass­ment and pro­ce­dural de­lays that in­ter­faith cou­ples have to suf­fer through in or­der to marry un­der the SMA force many among them to con­vert to their part­ner’s faith.</p>
    <p>This ex­pe­dites the mar­riage and makes it eas­ier un­der Hindu or Is­lamic mar­riage laws. Such an out­come also helps them avoid fam­ily pres­sure or ha­rass­ment from lo­cal po­lice – some­thing which cou­ples liv­ing to­gether face at times.</p>
    <p>But Ms Rehman and Mr Lal refuse to com­pro­mise in such a man­ner. “We have been clear right from the start of our re­la­tion­ship that we will not con­vert. We are what we are, we chose each other for what we are. Why change that?” she said.</p>
    <p>In cases where the woman is a Hindu and the man a Mus­lim, ac­cu­sa­tions of “love ji­had” fur­ther ag­gra­vate com­mu­nal ten­sion. The term is used by rad­i­cal Hindu groups to ac­cuse Mus­lim men of par­tic­i­pat­ing in a planned con­spir­acy to con­vert Hindu women to Is­lam by se­duc­ing them.</p>
