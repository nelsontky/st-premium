    </section>

    <p>It is a driz­zly Oc­to­ber af­ter­noon when I join artist He­man Chong for a walk through Telok Blan­gah Hill Park.</p>
    <p>The air is thick with hu­mid­ity and rain­drops fall on our um­brel­las in a gen­tle pit­ter-pat­ter.</p>
    <p>“This is my favourite sound in the world,” says Chong, 43, cock­ing his ear at the rain and tip­toe­ing so his shoes do not squeak.</p>
    <p>For the past two years, the avid walker has been film­ing his jour­neys on foot through neigh­bour­hoods in Sin­ga­pore and abroad. These im­mer­sive videos, shot from his per­spec­tive, range from a for­est walk in the mid­dle of a thun­der­storm to a noc­tur­nal am­ble through Gey­lang to a tour of the Bri­tish Mu­seum. The walk­ing videos – there are about 300 now – are up­loaded on YouTube for his Am­bi­ent Walk­ing chan­nel.</p>
    <p>Chong’s 6,790 sub­scribers are a var­ied bunch. Some are fans of ASMR (au­ton­o­mous sen­sory merid­ian re­sponse), a tin­gling sen­sa­tion trig­gered by stim­uli such as cer­tain sounds.</p>
    <p>Other view­ers are bed-bound, dis­abled or over­seas Sin­ga­pore­ans who miss home. One man even tunes in from jail in Europe.</p>
    <p>We are retracing one of his most pop­u­lar routes – an hour-long video where he walked through the forested hill dur­ing a thun­der­storm. The video, which was up­loaded in Fe­bru­ary, now has more than 145,000 views. Dur­ing the wild­fires in Cal­i­for­nia, he saw a big spike in view­ers from that area.</p>
    <p>Chong, a fan of Ja­pan-based “walk­tu­ber” Ram­balac, does not re­gard Am­bi­ent Walk­ing as art. But walk­ing, more gen­er­ally, re­mains a vi­tal part of his artis­tic process.</p>
    <p>“I am pro­cess­ing a lot of my work when I walk,” he says.</p>
    <p>His jour­neys have also taken him to the back­doors of em­bassies, which he pho­tographed for his For­eign Af­fairs project; and to empty, public-ac­ces­si­ble spa­ces in Sin­ga­pore, which he cap­tured in 1,001 im­ages that were later printed on more than seven decades of cal­en­dars for Cal­en­dars (2020-2096).</p>
    <p>More re­cently, he cre­ated Writ­ing While Walk­ing And Other Stories (2020), a dense wall of text dis­played on the Sin­ga­pore Art Mu­seum’s hoard­ing. He com­posed the 2,581 words on his iPhone dur­ing an eight-hour walk around Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>“I wanted to think about how I could sub­li­mate that ex­pe­ri­ence of walk­ing and writ­ing into an im­age, rather than a text. There was no tra­di­tional nar­ra­tive, no plot. The end point was just ex­haus­tion.”</p>
    <p>Chong, who does not have a driver’s li­cence and likes to get around on foot when he can, spends at least two hours walk­ing ev­ery day. It helps him keep fit, re­lieves anx­i­ety and can also be very med­i­ta­tive.</p>
    <p>“If you try walk­ing for long dis­tances, after an hour or two, your brain goes empty – at least mine does,” adds the artist, who would have gone on Ja­pan’s fa­mous Nakasendo trail this year if not for the global pan­demic.</p>
    <p>He de­scribes the act of walk­ing as a “de­nom­i­na­tor ac­tion”, a term he came up with to de­scribe sim­ple ac­tions such as read­ing and jump­ing.</p>
    <p>“I refuse for my art to be as­so­ci­ated with any com­plex ac­tions. I’m al­ways look­ing for a sim­ple ges­ture,” says Chong, who re­cently fin­ished redact­ing all the words in spy nov­el­ist John le Carre’s Call For The Dead (1961), leaving only verbs be­hind. This par­tic­u­lar project will be ex­hib­ited at STPI – Cre­ative Work­shop & Gallery in Fe­bru­ary.</p>
