    <p>BANGKOK • A Thai royal con­sort who was purged for “dis­loy­alty” af­ter run­ning afoul of the Queen has made a sud­den and un­ex­pected come­back, with the King re­in­stat­ing her ti­tles.</p>
    <p>Ms Si­neenat Wong­va­ji­ra­pakdi was stripped of her rank and ti­tles in Oc­to­ber l ast year, j ust three months af­ter she be­came the royal con­sort.</p>
    <p>She was ac­cused on na­tional tele­vi­sion of “dis­loy­alty” and “am­bi­tion” to match the po­si­tion of Queen Suthida.</p>
    <p>“Si­neenat Wong­va­ji­ra­pakdi is not tar­nished,” said a de­ci­sion of King Maha Va­ji­ra­longkorn pub­lished by palace mouth­piece Royal Gazette, con­firm­ing she would once again take the hon­orific ti­tle of “Chao Khun Phra”, or noble con­sort.</p>
    <p>“Hence­forth, it will be as if she had never been stripped of her mil­i­tary ranks or royal dec­o­ra­tions,” said the de­ci­sion, which was dated last Satur­day but came to light only yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The lat­est episode of palace in­trigue comes as Thai­land faces un­prece­dented protests by a prodemoc­racy move­ment call­ing for more trans­parency and re­forms to the se­cre­tive royal in­sti­tu­tion.</p>
    <p>A for­mer royal body­guard, Ms Si­neenat was given the ti­tle of con­sort on the King’s 67th birth­day in July last year, just months af­ter his mar­riage to Queen Suthida, 42.</p>
    <p>A qual­i­fied pi­lot and for­mer army nurse, the then 34-year-old Si­neenat was the first woman to re­ceive the ti­tle in nearly a cen­tury.</p>
    <p>Her promi­nence at the King’s elab­o­rate corona­tion cer­e­mony in May last year stunned the Thai pub­lic.</p>
    <p>The palace later re­leased im­ages of the short-haired con­sort in com­bat fa­tigues shoot­ing weapons, fly­ing a jet and pre­par­ing to para­chute from a plane, as well as hold­ing the King’s hand.</p>
    <p>Ms Si­neenat dis­ap­peared af­ter her pub­lic dis­grace and her where­abouts could not be con­firmed.</p>
    <p>This week, Bild news­pa­per re­ported she had ar­rived in Ger­many, where the King spends much of the year.</p>
    <p>The king­dom has seen near-daily ral­lies since mid-July, with some at­tract­ing up to 20,000 pro­test­ers, an­gry at the mil­i­tary-aligned gov­ern­ment and call­ing for frank dis­cus­sions about the royal fam­ily’s role.</p>
    <p>Pro­test­ers are de­mand­ing the scrap­ping of a royal defama­tion law – which can see peo­ple jailed for up to 15 years on each charge.</p>
    <p>King Maha Va­ji­ra­longkorn was of</p>
    <p>Si­neenat Wong­va­ji­ra­pakdi is not tar­nished. Hence­forth, it will be as if she had never been stripped of her mil­i­tary ranks or royal dec­o­ra­tions.</p>
    <p>KING MAHA VA­JI­RA­LONGKORN, in a de­ci­sion pub­lished by palace mouth­piece Royal Gazette, con­firm­ing she would once again take the hon­orific ti­tle of “Chao Khun Phra”, or noble con­sort.</p>
    <p>fi­cially crowned as con­sti­tu­tional monarch in May last year af­ter first tak­ing the throne fol­low­ing the 2016 death of his fa­ther, who reigned for 70 years.</p>
    <p>Since as­cend­ing to the throne, the King has taken per­sonal con­trol of the palace’s for­tune, worth an es­ti­mated US$60 bil­lion (S$82 bil­lion), and also moved two army units un­der his di­rect com­mand.</p>
    <p>He mar­ried three times when he was the crown prince and has seven chil­dren – five sons and two daugh­ters – from the mar­riages.</p>
    <p>Queen Suthida is his fourth wife. The royal cou­ple have no chil­dren.</p>
