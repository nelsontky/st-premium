In Mexico, which also posted a daily record last week and has the fourth-highest death toll of any country, officials warned that a downward trend in case numbers that began in mid-June – about the time its capital city started relaxing social distancing measures – could reverse.
Based on the rate of hospital admissions over the past week, Mexico City Mayor Claudia Sheinbaum said hospitalis­ation levels by October could exceed those registered in June, the height of the pandemic.
In Europe, where the summer vacation season is in full swing, a new daily record figure in Spain is likely to deter tourists from visiting one of the continent’s most popular destinatio­ns.
In China, the health commission yesterday reported 34 new coronaviru­s cases for Friday, up from 21 cases a day earlier. Of the new infections, 20 were in the far western region of Xinjiang, according to a statement by the National Health Commission. Nine were in the north-eastern province of Liaoning, while the remaining five were imported cases.

Putting those with mild to moderate symptoms and those with severe symptoms in different hospitals has helped even the load, he said.
Epidemiolo­gists have warned that East Java faces an uphill battle as new cases continue to rise, and without sufficient testing, the chain of infections cannot easily be broken.
Dr Windhu said that with a 40 million population, the province needs at least 40,000 weekly tests to be in line with the World Health Organisati­on’s testing benchmark.
“Our testing capacity has indeed improved with 4,500 tests per day. But ideally, we need 5,700 daily tests, so we must catch up,” he said.
Ensuring that the public observe health protocols is also key to lowering infections, Dr Sutrisno said.
“Resilient villages” have been establishe­d across East Java in areas with a high number of cases to ensure people comply with the protocols, such as the wearing of masks and temperatur­e-taking. Surabaya has also introduced a similar initiative.
Businessma­n Chusnan Marzuki, a resident of Bratang Binangun in Baratajaya village, Surabaya, said the neighbourh­ood of up to 70 households has taken measures, such as adopting a one-gate system and spraying disinfecta­nt in public places regularly, to prevent the spread of the virus. “The situation in our neighbourh­ood is under control. There has been no one testing positive so far,” he said.
Said Ms Dea: “I hope people obey the health protocols. I hope they won’t believe Covid-19 is as dangerous as it is only when they contract it themselves, or when they lose their family.” New virus epicentre East Java in tough battle to reduce deaths Linda Yulisman UNSUSPECTI­NG VICTIMS Indonesia Correspond­ent In Jakarta It was like a nightmare and I was very shocked... Before Covid-19 hit my family, I didn’t realise how dangerous and deadly it was. Over just four days, Covid-19 decimated half of Surabaya resident Dea Winnie Pertiwi’s family, killing her parents and eldest sister, who was eight months pregnant.
Their deaths happened as May crossed into June, just as the coronaviru­s was tightening its grip on East Java province, including its capital Surabaya, home to three million.
Ms Dea said her family members were severely ill by the time they were admitted to hospital in late May, but tests were slow in coming.
After the deaths, Ms Dea, her elder sister, and eldest sister’s husband and 18-month-old daughter also tested positive for the disease, but they went on to recover.
“It was like a nightmare and I was very shocked,” the infrastruc­ture contractor, 27, told The Sunday Times over the phone last Monday.
“Before Covid-19 hit my family, I didn’t realise how dangerous and deadly it was.”
Her family members had developed symptoms in mid-May, but had believed them to be a result of flu and had taken over-the-counter drugs for it.
But the virus was making serious inroads into East Java by then.
As of yesterday, 1,572 people in the province had died due to Covid-19, double Jakarta’s 755 deaths, according to official figures. East Java recorded 20,256 infections, overtaking Jakarta’s 18,741. ’’ MS DEA WINNIE PERTIWI, who lost her parents and eldest sister, who was eight months pregnant, to Covid-19. branch of the Indonesian Doctors Associatio­n, Dr Sutrisno. The disease had also infected 354 nurses, 11 of whom have died, he added.
“There were so many patients, especially those without symptoms, (at the hospitals) and they were not easily recognised by the doctors at the initial stage,” he said.
Dr Joni Wahyuhadi, who leads the curative management team of East Java’s Covid-19 task force, acknowledg­ed that some hospitals had been overwhelme­d when the number of cases rose sharply last month.
Dr Joni, president director at the Dr Soetomo General Hospital in Surabaya, said when infections surged early last month, its emergency unit was swamped with patients.
He added that while 300 hospi- The East Java province has assumed the Indonesian capital’s mantle as the epicentre of the pandemic.
The most crucial task for East Java is reducing the number of deaths, said epidemiolo­gist Windhu Purnomo of Airlangga University.
By yesterday, the province’s case fatality rate (CFR), the ratio of deaths to confirmed cases, was 7.8 per cent, above the national figure of 4.8 per cent.
“The rise of the CFR is an issue at overloaded hospitals,” he said.
Across the province, Covid-19 has also killed a fair number of health workers, a sign of how the healthcare system has struggled to cope with the pandemic.
So far, 116 doctors had tested positive for Covid-19, 21 of whom have died, said chairman of East Java’s ylinda@sph.com.sg ters to discuss contagion measures, and Prime Minister Jean Castex later announced on-the-spot tests would be required for travellers visiting from 16 high-risk countries, including the United States.
France has yet to resume general travel to and from these countries so the tests will be for returning French citizens and residents.
Masks are now mandatory on public transport, in shops and enclosed spaces across France. Still, there are fears that the summer holidays could see a spike in cases with people flocking to beaches and tourist spots.
Britain on Friday made it compulsory to wear a face covering in shopping centres, banks, takeaway outlets, sandwich shops and supermarke­ts, following the lead of Scotland.
Exceptions have been made, including for children under 11 or people with respirator­y problems, but others who refuse to cover their nose and mouth risk a fine of up to £100 (S$177).
Germany will offer free coronaviru­s tests to all returning travellers in new measures agreed on Friday.
And Austria made face masks mandatory again in supermarke­ts, food stores, post offices, bank branches, pharmacies and healthcare facilities along with public transport.
United Nations projection­s have warned that the virus could kill 1.67 million people in 30 low-income countries.
Virus restrictio­ns have been bolstered in several other places, including Australia as well as Hong Kong and the Japanese capital Tokyo. Europe Tighter mask rules, more tests as WHO warns of virus resurgence • The World Health Organisati­on (WHO) has expressed concern over a coronaviru­s resurgence in Europe as Britain joined France, Germany and Austria in announcing tighter mask rules and greater testing.
Europe accounts for a fifth of the world’s more than 15 million infections and remains the hardest-hit region in terms of deaths, with 207,118 out of more than 630,000 global fatalities since the virus was first detected in China late last year.
The WHO’s European chapter pointed to rising cases on the continent over the past two weeks, saying tighter measures might be needed to curb the spread.
Like other regions, Europe struggling to balance restrictio­ns to halt Covid-19 against the need to revive economies as people there emerge from some of the world’s toughest lockdowns.
A three-year-old girl died i n Belgium, becoming the country’s youngest known coronaviru­s victim, in a further wake-up call for a continent that has recently lifted shutdowns.
“The recent resurgence in Covid-19 cases in some countries following the easing of physical distancing measures is certainly cause for concern,” a WHO-Europe spokesman said on Friday.
“If the situation demands, reintroduc­tion of stricter, targeted measures with the full engagement of communitie­s may be needed.”
Spain is facing worrying outbreaks in Aragon and Catalonia, where officials have reintroduc­ed local restrictio­ns and urged residents in Barcelona and its suburbs to leave home only for essential trips over a two-week period.
