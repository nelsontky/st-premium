    <p>LON­DON • Manch­ester United’s 5-0 rout of Bun­desliga lead­ers RB Leipzig in the Cham­pi­ons League on Wed­nes­day showed signs that man­ager Ole Gun­nar Sol­sk­jaer has the nous to man­age his squad.</p>
    <p>The re­sult against last sea­son’s semi-fi­nal­ists was all the more im­pres­sive, with key play­ers given a rest from the start­ing line-up and an untested mid­field was fielded.</p>
    <p>Mar­cus Rash­ford struck three times af­ter com­ing on as a 63rd­minute substitute, with An­thony Mar­tial and Ma­son Green­wood, who both also scored, start­ing in at­tack.</p>
    <p>Bruno Fer­nan­des was also held back un­til the se­cond half with sum­mer sign­ing Donny van de Beek given his first start out­side of the League Cup.</p>
    <p>Paul Pogba, who had not started since the 6-1 home de­feat by Tot­ten­ham, was re­called along with Nemanja Matic, form­ing a mid­field di­a­mond along­side van de Beek and Fred.</p>
    <p>It was not un­til Fer­nan­des and Rash­ford were on the field that United ran away with the game but as Sol­sk­jaer noted, the ba­sis had been built with­out them.</p>
    <p>“Mar­cus Rash­ford came on and did well but the ground­work was there from the team, that’s what you want from the subs. What a shift they put in. Leipzig are a high press (team), (they play with) in­ten­sity, so we had to dig deep,” he said. “We had to rest a few be­cause the sea­son is re­lent­less, so we used the squad. This group is com­ing to­gether. The more qual­ity and spirit you have, the more you get the per­for­mance.”</p>
    <p>There was even a cameo ap­pear­ance for Edinson Cavani, who had a goal dis­al­lowed in the lat­ter stages. Af­ter be­ing forced to over­play a num­ber of play­ers last term, Sol­sk­jaer can now man­age his play­ers’ min­utes on the pitch.</p>
    <p>“We made some changes to­day be­cause of (Arse­nal on) Sun­day as you have to be ready for that. We need to pick up points,” the Nor­we­gian said.</p>
    <p>One player who is un­likely to fea­ture in Sun­day’s Pre­mier League clash is left-back Alex Telles, an­other of United’s new sign­ings.</p>
    <p>The Brazil­ian tested pos­i­tive for Covid-19 but is show­ing no symp­toms and is ex­pected to re­turn to ac­tion soon.</p>
    <p>“Telles has tested pos­i­tive for the coro­n­avirus so he’s been out for a few days,” Sol­sk­jaer said. “No symp­toms though, so he’ll be fine. Back soon.”</p>
    <p>United, who en­dured a tor­rid start to their do­mes­tic sea­son with only two wins in five games, have taken con­trol of the Cham­pi­ons League Group H af­ter build­ing on their im­pres­sive open­ing 2-1 win against Paris Saint-Ger­main.</p>
    <p>Leipzig are third, level on three points with PSG, who beat Is­tan­bul</p>
    <p>Basak­se­hir 2-0.</p>
    <p>A shell-shocked Leipzig coach Ju­lian Nagels­mann, for whom this was his first de­feat of the sea­son, said: “It was a bit crazy be­cause af­ter they scored the first goal, we did well. Then the fi­nal 20 min­utes were very bad.”</p>
