    <p>We re­fer to re­cent let­ters and Dr Wong Chi­ang Yin’s op-ed on In­te­grated Shield Plans (IPs) (Who is mind­ing the gap on health in health in­sur­ance?, Sept 17).</p>
    <p>Dr Wong raised con­cerns that Aviva had re­moved its IP cov­er­age for med­i­cally nec­es­sary di­ag­nos­tic en­do­scopies and asked if there were gaps in over­sight of IP in­sur­ers.</p>
    <p>Med­i­cally nec­es­sary di­ag­nos­tic pro­ce­dures are cov­ered by IP in­sur­ers. The Mon­e­tary Au­thor­ity of Sin­ga­pore (MAS) has en­gaged Aviva, which clar­i­fied that it did not change its IP terms and con­di­tions.</p>
    <p>It had tight­ened its claims as­sess­ments, hav­ing ob­served a trend of ques­tion­able claims. How­ever, this tight­en­ing re­sulted in claims be­ing re­jected de­spite be­ing med­i­cally nec­es­sary.</p>
    <p>Aviva has since re­vised its as­sess­ment ap­proach and un­der­taken to ap­prove such claims.</p>
    <p>The Min­istry of Health (MOH) and the MAS work closely to­gether in ex­er­cis­ing reg­u­la­tory over­sight over IP in­sur­ers. They have to seek ap­proval from MOH for chang­ing IP terms and con­di­tions.</p>
    <p>MAS will act against in­sur­ers if they do not pay claims in ac­cor­dance with the pol­icy terms or have un­fair claims han­dling prac­tices.</p>
    <p>MOH and MAS will en­hance our sur­veil­lance ef­forts so that in­ap­pro­pri­ate prac­tices can be iden­ti­fied and dealt with more ex­pe­di­tiously.</p>
    <p>We will also look into:</p>
    <p>pro­vid­ing guid­ance on de­ter­min­ing the med­i­cal ne­ces­sity for spe­cific pro­ce­dures; re­quir­ing in­sur­ers in­cor­po­rate this guid­ance into their claims as­sess­ment.</p>
    <p>Dr Wong’s com­ment that an IP pol­i­cy­holder can be worse off than some­one cov­ered only by MediShield Life is in­cor­rect.</p>
    <p>IPs pro­vide ad­di­tional cov­er­age above the MediShield Life com­po­nent. As the Cen­tral Prov­i­dent Fund Board as­sesses all claims for that com­po­nent of IPs, a per­son with an IP would not re­ceive a lower pay­out than a per­son with only MediShield Life.</p>
    <p>All stake­hold­ers – pa­tients, in­sur­ers and med­i­cal prac­ti­tion­ers – have a role in en­sur­ing health in­sur­ance re­mains af­ford­able.</p>
    <p>Pa­tients should re­frain from over-con­sum­ing health­care; doc­tors should pre­scribe only treat­ments that are med­i­cally nec­es­sary; and in­sur­ers should as­sess claims care­fully to min­imise over-con­sump­tion with­out com­pro­mis­ing nec­es­sary health­care.</p>
    <p>MOH and MAS will step up en­gage­ment with clin­i­cians and in­sur­ers to strengthen good prac­tices that will help en­sure ap­pro­pri­ate and af­ford­able care.</p>
