    <p>SEOUL • Big Hit En­ter­tain­ment, the man­age­ment la­bel of South Korean su­per­star K-pop group BTS, hit the stock market with a 9.6 tril­lion won (S$11.4 bil­lion) val­u­a­tion yes­ter­day be­fore wor­ries over its nar­row rev­enue stream pulled shares be­low the de­but price.</p>
    <p>Big Hit, which re­lies heav­ily on the boy band for rev­enue, opened at 270,000 won – dou­ble its ini­tial pub­lic of­fer­ing (IPO) price – and surged by as much as 30 per cent in early trade be­fore drop­ping back to just un­der the list price.</p>
    <p>In­ter­est in South Korea’s third largest IPO of the year was high, with al­most half of Big Hit’s 10 mil­lion trade­able shares chang­ing hands yes­ter­day morn­ing, ac­cord­ing to the Korea Ex­change web­site.</p>
    <p>An­a­lysts say the com­pany has proven it­self on­line savvy, us­ing YouTube and so­cial me­dia for market in­fil­tra­tion since in-per­son per­for­mances were can­celled be­cause of the coro­n­avirus pan­demic.</p>
    <p>But there are some con­cerns about Big Hit’s re­liance on its star artists. The Bill­board Chart-top­ping BTS, which have a huge global fol­low­ing, ac­counted for 87.7 per cent of the la­bel’s rev­enue in the first half of this year, ac­cord­ing to a reg­u­la­tory fil­ing.</p>
    <p>It is a sce­nario com­mon among South Korean en­ter­tain­ment com­pa­nies and one in­vestors are fa­mil­iar with, but it makes rev­enue espe­cially vul­ner­a­ble to any dis­rup­tions in out­put from key ta­lent.</p>
    <p>“The in­dus­try un­der­goes a lot of fluc­tu­a­tions,” said Hyundai Mo­tor Se­cu­ri­ties an­a­lyst Kim Hyun-yong, cit­ing po­ten­tial ob­sta­cles such as the coun­try’s manda­tory mil­i­tary ser­vice. That ser­vice is loom­ing for BTS, with the el­dest mem­ber of the band cur­rently re­quired to sign up by the end of next year and the re­main­ing six mem­bers over the fol­low­ing five years.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day’s float made the band mem­bers in­stant multi-mil­lion­aires, with each granted shares worth 18.5 bil­lion won at the de­but price, but BTS’ of­fi­cial Twit­ter ac­count did not ref­er­ence the list­ing, fo­cus­ing in­stead on the group’s win at the co­in­cid­ing United States Bill­board Mu­sic Awards for Top So­cial Artist.</p>
    <p>An­a­lysts said BTS’ suc­cess­ful on­line con­certs have partly made up for per­for­mances can­celled due to Covid-19. Ad­di­tion­ally, Big Hit’s un­prece­dented level of con­trol over its rev­enue streams via its Weverse fan­dom plat­form that dis­trib­utes BTS con­tent and sells mer­chan­dise, dif­fer­en­ti­ate the la­bel.
