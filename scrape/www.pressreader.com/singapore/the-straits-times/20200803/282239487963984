    <p>Te­masek has not yet de­cided whether to in­voke a ma­te­rial ad­verse change (MAC) clause in its $4.1 bil­lion con­di­tional of­fer for Kep­pel Corp, ad­viser Mor­gan Stan­ley said last Satur­day.</p>
    <p>Kep­pel fell to a $697.6 mil­lion se­cond-quar­ter net loss last Thurs­day, breach­ing a thresh­old in state in­vestor Te­masek’s of­fer to buy con­trol of the com­pany.</p>
    <p>“At this stage, the of­feror has not made a de­ci­sion whether to in­voke the MAC pre-con­di­tion based on the 2Q2020 re­sults,” Mor­gan Stan­ley said in a reg­u­la­tory fil­ing is­sued on be­half of Te­masek.</p>
    <p>“If the MAC pre-con­di­tion is in­voked by the of­feror, the pre-con­di­tional par­tial of­fer will be with­drawn,” it said, adding that a de­ci­sion on the mat­ter would be dis­closed no later than Aug 31.</p>
    <p>MAC clauses can be in­voked to end or rene­go­ti­ate deals, par­tic­u­larly if events oc­cur that are detri­men­tal to the tar­get com­pany.</p>
    <p>Last Oc­to­ber, Te­masek, which al­ready owns about one-fifth of Kep­pel, of­fered to buy an ad­di­tional 30.6 per cent stake at $7.35 per share in cash.</p>
    <p>Kep­pel chief ex­ec­u­tive Loh Chin Hua said at Thurs­day’s re­sults brief­ing: “We be­lieve that the 20 per cent thresh­old in the MAC clause in re­spect of net profit af­ter tax has been crossed.”</p>
    <p>He said this meant that the pre­con­di­tion in Te­masek’s of­fer had not been sat­is­fied as of Thurs­day. He added that the com­pany was un­able to com­ment on the of­fer or the ac­tion that Te­masek could take.</p>
    <p>Still, the deal has a long-stop date of Oct 21, mean­ing Kep­pel could make up any short­fall in its third-quar­ter re­sults, while Te­masek also has the right to waive its pre-con­di­tions.</p>
    <p>Kep­pel’s loss came on the back of worse-than-ex­pected pro­vi­sions of $919 mil­lion dur­ing the pe­riod, mostly re­lated to its off­shore and marine busi­ness.</p>
    <p>Mr Loh pointed out that the im­pair­ments were non-cash items and would not ham­per Kep­pel’s abil­ity to se­cure fund­ing in an un­cer­tain, pan­demic-hit en­vi­ron­ment. He also said the group’s un­der­ly­ing busi­ness, apart from Kep­pel Off­shore & Marine, re­mains strong.</p>
    <p>Last Oc­to­ber, Te­masek, which al­ready owns about one-fifth of Kep­pel, of­fered to buy an ad­di­tional 30.6 per cent stake at $7.35 per share in cash.</p>
