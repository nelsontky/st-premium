    <p>Sin­ga­pore’s man­u­fac­tur­ing out­put dropped for the first time in three months in Oc­to­ber, with only the bio­med­i­cal and pre­ci­sion en­gi­neer­ing clus­ters see­ing growth.</p>
    <p>Fac­tory out­put fell 0.9 per cent year on year, af­ter a re­vised 25.6 per cent jump in Septem­ber and a 16.4 per cent rise in Au­gust, ac­cord­ing to data re­leased yes­ter­day by the Economic De­vel­op­ment Board (EDB).</p>
    <p>Economists had ex­pected a 6.2 per cent in­crease, ac­cord­ing to the me­dian in a Reuters poll.</p>
    <p>How­ever, most an­a­lysts said the un­ex­pected turn was un­likely to change the tra­jec­tory of the economic re­cov­ery.</p>
    <p>They said that even the rel­a­tively slow start to the fourth quar­ter will even­tu­ally give way to stronger out­put next year, backed by ris­ing global de­mand.</p>
    <p>On a sea­son­ally ad­justed mon­thon-month ba­sis, last month’s out­put shrank 19 per cent – af­ter four con­sec­u­tive months of se­quen­tial im­prove­ment, and was the worst since Fe­bru­ary when it dropped by 22 per cent.</p>
    <p>Trans­port en­gi­neer­ing led the out­put de­cline with a 31.8 per cent year-on-year plunge.</p>
    <p>EDB said in a state­ment yes­ter­day that lev­els of ac­tiv­ity in aero­space firms and ship­yards re­mained low as new or­ders were ad­versely im­pacted by travel re­stric­tions and a weak global oil and gas mar­ket.</p>
    <p>Gen­eral man­u­fac­tur­ing con­tracted 12.8 per cent last month on a year-on-year ba­sis, with all seg­ments record­ing out­put de­clines.</p>
    <p>The bio­med­i­cal clus­ter grew 10.2 per cent year on year, cool­ing from the 91.2 per cent out­put surge it en­joyed in Septem­ber.</p>
    <p>With­out this seg­ment, over­all man­u­fac­tur­ing would have dropped by 2.7 per cent.</p>
    <p>Pre­ci­sion en­gi­neer­ing out­put also in­creased – by 10.6 per cent last month, com­pared with the same pe­riod a year ago.</p>
    <p>Elec­tron­ics out­put de­clined 0.6 per cent year on year last month, af­ter pan­demic-driven de­mand drove dou­ble-digit gains in the pre­vi­ous two months.</p>
    <p>While the elec­tronic mod­ules and com­po­nents as well as com­puter pe­riph­er­als and data stor­age seg­ments grew 16 per cent and 20.2 per cent re­spec­tively, the semi­con­duc­tors as well as in­fo­comms and con­sumer elec­tron­ics seg­ments shrank 2 per cent and 2.5 per cent re­spec­tively.</p>
    <p>How­ever, the elec­tron­ics clus­ter’s out­put is still up by 7.1 per cent year on year in the first 10 months of this year.</p>
    <p>Ms Se­lena Ling, OCBC Bank’s chief economist and head of trea­sury re­search and strat­egy, said the man­u­fac­tur­ing data con­firmed her ear­lier ex­pec­ta­tion of a fourthquar­ter growth wob­ble af­ter a Vshaped third-quar­ter bounce.</p>
    <p>The pos­si­ble soft patch in the fourth quar­ter was also flagged by the non-oil do­mes­tic ex­ports data for last month, which showed a 3.1 per cent de­cline, snap­ping four straight months of growth.</p>
    <p>Elec­tron­ics ship­ments dipped 0.4 per cent af­ter ris­ing 21.4 per cent the pre­vi­ous month, fig­ures re­leased last week showed.</p>
    <p>“The key ques­tion is whether the cur­rent soft patch in elec­tron­ics, par­tic­u­larly semi­con­duc­tors, will per­sist in the com­ing months,” said Ms Ling, not­ing that so far, there does not ap­pear to be any sug­ges­tions of wide­spread semi­con­duc­tor in­dus­try weak­ness world­wide.</p>
    <p>The semi­con­duc­tors and elec­tron­ics ma­chin­ery in­dus­try is tipped to see 9.7 per cent growth this year, with a pickup into next year, ac­cord­ing to In­ter­act Anal­y­sis.</p>
    <p>“This Oc­to­ber soft patch cer­tainly poses down­side risk to Sin­ga­pore’s fourth-quar­ter man­u­fac­tur­ing and GDP (gross do­mes­tic prod­uct) growth,” said Ms Ling.</p>
    <p>That said, the 2021 of­fi­cial GDP growth fore­cast of 4 per cent to 6 per cent as­sumes the over­all re­cov­ery will sus­tain into next year, she noted.</p>
    <p>Mr Sin Beng Ong, an­a­lyst at JP Mor­gan, said last month’s man­u­fac­tur­ing per­for­mance was more of a blip in the economic up­swing.</p>
    <p>“We view this as a pause rather than a change in trend,” he said.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore’s Oc­to­ber Pur­chas­ing Man­agers’ In­dex (PMI) sig­nalled ex­pan­sion, con­sis­tent with the other re­gional sur­veys, he said.</p>
    <p>“More­over, the Novem­ber flash PMIs from the de­vel­oped mar­kets con­vey a sim­i­lar re­silience in man­u­fac­tur­ing de­spite the rise in Covid-19 cases,” he noted.</p>
    <p>The PMI data ear­lier this month showed that the man­u­fac­tur­ing in­dex inched up to 50.5 last month from 50.3 in Septem­ber, mov­ing slightly fur­ther above the 50-point thresh­old that sep­a­rates ex­pan­sion from con­trac­tion.</p>
