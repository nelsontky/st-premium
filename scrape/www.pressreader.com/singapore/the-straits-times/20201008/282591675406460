    <p>• Turner Prize win­ner Damien Hirst looks back on his time as one of the most no­to­ri­ous “Young Bri­tish Artists” in a new solo ret­ro­spec­tive show, which opened in London yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The ex­hi­bi­tion, ti­tled End Of A Cen­tury, fea­tures more than 50 in­stal­la­tions, paint­ings and sculp­tures from his time as a stu­dent in the 1980s to the 1990s, when he and oth­ers such as Tracey Emin dom­i­nated the Bri­tish art scene.</p>
    <p>There are some well-known works, in­clud­ing those from the iconic se­ries Nat­u­ral His­tory – an­i­mals pre­served in formalde­hyde and dis­played in large tanks – along­side oth­ers that have never be­fore been shown in pub­lic.</p>
    <p>Speak­ing to Agence FrancePres­se about his work back then, he re­called a time of drugs and drink­ing: “It felt like a mas­sive cel­e­bra­tion and I felt im­mor­tal in some way. So it’s quite funny to see the works in here. They look a lit­tle bit old and bro­ken and there’s pen­cil marks. Things are age­ing in a kind of nos­tal­gic way, whereas at the time, I re­ally thought I was im­mor­tal and it would never stop.”</p>
    <p>Hirst is stag­ing the ret­ro­spec­tive at his New­port Street Gallery. He wor­ried about ex­hibit­ing other artists dur­ing the coro­n­avirus pan­demic, so he de­cided to show his own work.</p>
    <p>He kept paint­ing dur­ing lock­down, say­ing he was used to work­ing on his own, al­though he had to stop us­ing as­sis­tants. “I started mix­ing my own paints, clean­ing my own brushes. What kept me sane re­ally was be­ing able to go to the stu­dio ev­ery day and paint.”</p>
