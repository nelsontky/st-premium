    <p>HONG KONG • Ap­ple on Thurs­day re­moved 39,000 game apps on its China store, the big­gest re­moval in a sin­gle day, as it set the year-end as the dead­line for all game pub­lish­ers to ob­tain a li­cence.</p>
    <p>The take­downs come amid a crack­down on un­li­censed games by the Chi­nese au­thor­i­ties.</p>
    <p>In­clud­ing the 39,000 games, Ap­ple has now re­moved more than 46,000 apps from its store.</p>
    <p>Games af­fected by the sweep in­cluded Ubisoft ti­tle As­sas­sin’s Creed Iden­tity and 2K Sports’ NBA 2K20, ac­cord­ing to re­search firm Qi­mai.</p>
    <p>Qi­mai also said only 74 of the top 1,500 paid games on Ap­ple store sur­vived the purge.</p>
    <p>Ap­ple did not re­spond to a re­quest for com­ment.</p>
    <p>The tech gi­ant ini­tially gave game pub­lish­ers an end-of-June dead­line to sub­mit a gov­ern­men­tis­sued li­cence num­ber en­abling users to make in-app pur­chases in the world’s big­gest games mar­ket.</p>
    <p>The com­pany later ex­tended the dead­line to Jan 1.</p>
    <p>China’s An­droid app stores have long com­plied with reg­u­la­tions on li­cences.</p>
    <p>It is un­clear why Ap­ple is en­forc­ing them more strictly this year.</p>
    <p>An­a­lysts said the move was no sur­prise as Ap­ple con­tin­ues to close loop­holes to fall in line with China’s con­tent reg­u­la­tors, and would not di­rectly af­fect the com­pany’s bot­tom line as much as pre­vi­ous re­movals.</p>
    <p>“How­ever, this ma­jor pivot to only ac­cept­ing paid games that have a game li­cence, cou­pled with China’s ex­tremely low num­ber of for­eign game li­cences ap­proved in the past year will prob­a­bly lead more game de­vel­op­ers to switch to an ad-sup­ported model for their Chi­nese ver­sions,” said Mr Todd Kuhns, mar­ket­ing man­ager for Ap­pInChina, a firm that helps over­seas com­pa­nies dis­trib­ute their apps.</p>
