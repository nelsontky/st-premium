    <p>AM­S­TER­DAM New Nether­lands coach Frank de Boer was in a de­fi­ant mood af­ter Mex­ico handed his side a de­feat in his first game in charge as they en­joyed a de­served 1-0 win over their hosts in a friendly on Wed­nes­day.</p>
    <p>Raul Jimenez made up for sev­eral missed first-half chances by tuck­ing away a penalty on the hour mark af­ter Nathan Ake had pulled him back in the area.</p>
    <p>It was as much as an en­ter­pris­ing Mex­i­can side de­served as they set up nu­mer­ous chances in con­trast to a pedes­trian dis­play from the Dutch.</p>
    <p>De Boer named debu­tants Teun Koop­mein­ers and Owen Wi­jn­dal in his first se­lec­tion, rest­ing regulars with up­com­ing Na­tions League matches in Bos­nia on Sun­day and Italy on Tues­day.</p>
    <p>But there was lit­tle for the coach, who re­placed Ron­ald Koe­man, to en­thuse over as the Dutch looked limp in at­tack and com­mit­ted sev­eral de­fen­sive er­rors that of­fered Mex­ico chances to score.</p>
    <p>“I do not be­lieve that I am the first na­tional coach to lose on his de­but.” de Boer in­sisted af­ter the de­feat.</p>
    <p>“The re­sult is un­pleas­ant, but it was a prac­tice match. You could</p>
    <p>I do not be­lieve I’m the first na­tional coach to lose on his de­but. The re­sult is un­pleas­ant, but it was a prac­tice match. You could give the ex­cuse not all the best guys played.</p>
    <p>give the ex­cuse that not all the best guys played.</p>
    <p>“We know that some­one like Frenkie de Jong is very im­por­tant, and he was miss­ing. But let’s not for­get that Teun Koop­mein­ers played a very good game in the mid­dle.</p>
    <p>“It’s al­ways dis­ap­point­ing to lose, we started poorly, made too many un­nec­es­sary mis­takes and didn’t get into our own game. Of course we can do bet­ter.”</p>
    <p>The 50-year-old left Ma­jor League Soc­cer side At­lanta in July af­ter a poor run of form and his ap­point­ment as Nether­lands coach raised eye­brows among fans who were unim­pressed by his record at</p>
    <p>club level in re­cent years.</p>
    <p>Serie A club In­ter Mi­lan sacked de Boer af­ter just 85 days in 2016, while he lasted only seven games as Crys­tal Palace man­ager in the Premier League the fol­low­ing year.</p>
    <p>He was not the only coach to come un­der fire on Wed­nes­day.</p>
    <p>Ger­many coach Joachim Low be­moaned his side’s in­abil­ity to hold on to a lead af­ter they con­ceded a last-gasp equaliser at home in a thrilling 3-3 friendly draw against Turkey.</p>
    <p>Stuttgart-born Ke­nan Kara­man bun­dled in a late leveller against the coun­try of his birth as Turkey fought back from be­hind three</p>
    <p>times to snatch a draw and leave Low scratch­ing his head.</p>
    <p>The draw was Ger­many’s third in three games, and the third time in a row that they have failed to win af­ter tak­ing the lead.</p>
    <p>“I’m dis­ap­pointed and frus­trated. We have had this prob­lem for a while, and the same thing hap­pened in other games,” Low told broad­caster RTL. “We need to talk about what we can do bet­ter and about the men­tal­ity we need to de­velop.”</p>
    <p>In other matches, world cham­pi­ons France thrashed Ukraine 7-1 at the Stade de France.</p>
    <p>France coach Di­dier Deschamps</p>
    <p>made Olivier Giroud cap­tain for his 100th ap­pear­ance and in re­turn, the Chelsea for­ward scored a firsthalf brace that left him on 42 in­ter­na­tional goals, leapfrog­ging Michel Pla­tini (41) to go sec­ond on the all­time list for Les Bleus. He is nine short of Thierry Henry’s tally.</p>
    <p>Euro­pean cham­pi­ons Por­tu­gal re­turn to the Stade de France in the Na­tions League on Sun­day and used a friendly with their Ibe­rian ri­vals Spain to warm up.</p>
    <p>Cris­tiano Ron­aldo and Re­nato Sanches both struck the wood­work as the match ended in a goal-less stale­mate.</p>
    <p>FRANK DE BOER , Nether­lands coach, wants to be given time to prove him­self in his new role.</p>

The 1-0 friendly de&#xAD;feat at home will be a con&#xAD;cern for new coach Frank de Boer as many fans and crit&#xAD;ics are not con&#xAD;vinced he is the right man for the job ahead of next year&#x2019;s Euro 2020.</p>
