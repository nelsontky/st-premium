    <p>• Soft­Bank Group shares tum­bled in Tokyo yes­ter­day af­ter re­ports sur­faced that the Ja­panese con­glom­er­ate made sub­stan­tial bets on eq­uity de­riv­a­tives amid a surge in tech­nol­ogy stocks.</p>
    <p>The shares dropped as much as 8 per cent, the most on an in­tra­day ba­sis since March.</p>
    <p>The stock had gained 33 per cent this year be­fore yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The Fi­nan­cial Times (FT), Wall Street Jour­nal (WSJ) and Zero Hedge re­ported that Soft­Bank was mak­ing mas­sive bets on tech­nol­ogy stocks us­ing eq­uity op­tions.</p>
    <p>The FT la­belled Soft­Bank a “Nas­daq whale” that “stoked the fevered rally in big tech stocks” though it did not in­clude de­tails of any trad­ing.</p>
    <p>The re­ports touched off con­cerns that bil­lion­aire founder Masayoshi Son is em­bark­ing on a risky en­deav­our in un­fa­mil­iar ter­ri­tory, which could lead to losses like those Soft­Bank suf­fered af­ter its enor­mous bet on of­fice-shar­ing start-up WeWork.</p>
    <p>The stock de­cline came de­spite an FT report that Soft­Bank had gained about US$4 bil­lion (S$5.46 bil­lion) from the de­riv­a­tive bets.</p>
    <p>“Soft­Bank was rid­ing the Nas­daq wave like a mu­tual fund,” said Ichiyoshi As­set Man­age­ment se­nior ex­ec­u­tive of­fi­cer Mit­sushige Akino.</p>
    <p>“The mar­ket is fall­ing now and in­vestors have zero vis­i­bil­ity, so they are selling Soft­Bank stocks.”</p>
    <p>The Ja­panese com­pany said last month that it was start­ing a new unit to trade pub­lic se­cu­ri­ties, push­ing be­yond its tra­di­tional base in telecom­mu­ni­ca­tions and pri­vate start-up in­vest­ments.</p>
    <p>Bloomberg re­ported last month that Soft­Bank was tar­get­ing in­vest­ments of more than US$10 bil­lion, per­haps tens of bil­lions, and would use fi­nanc­ing struc­tures that would al­low the com­pany to avoid show­ing up in pub­lic dis­clo­sures of share­hold­ing.</p>
    <p>The Ja­panese com­pany’s de­riv­a­tives strat­egy had been built over the past few months, the FT cited peo­ple as say­ing, adding that Soft­Bank spent about US$4 bil­lion on op­tions pre­mi­ums fo­cused on tech stocks over that time.</p>
    <p>Soft­Bank now has large but un­re­alised profits, and the trades have been deeply con­tro­ver­sial even within the com­pany, the news­pa­per re­ported.</p>
    <p>The WSJ re­ported that Soft­Bank spent about US$4 bil­lion buy­ing call op­tions on stocks, while it also sold call op­tions at higher prices.</p>
    <p>Mr Son has ex­per­i­mented with dozens of busi­nesses since found­ing Soft­Bank in 1981.</p>
    <p>He be­gan his career in soft­ware dis­tri­bu­tion, trade shows and mag­a­zines, be­fore ex­pand­ing into telecom­mu­ni­ca­tions and start-up in­vest­ments.</p>
    <p>He fre­quently made moves that baf­fled and frus­trated his in­vestors. He ac­quired wire­less car­rier Sprint in the United States, but strug­gled to turn it around and sold the busi­ness this year.</p>
    <p>He ac­quired chip de­signer Arm for US$32 bil­lion four years ago in a move that spooked in­vestors. Soft­Bank had been in talks to sell Arm this year, Bloomberg re­ported.</p>
    <p>In an­other move, he set up a US$100 bil­lion Vi­sion Fund to take stakes in scores of tech star­tups. The fund re­ported US$17.7 bil­lion in losses for the fis­cal year ended in March, af­ter writ­ing down the value of hold­ings, in­clud­ing WeWork and Uber Tech­nolo­gies.</p>
    <p>The mar­ket surge this year has helped lift start-up val­u­a­tions and de­mand for ini­tial pub­lic of­fer­ings has soared.</p>
    <p>“In a world where vol­umes are dis­torted by the fran­tic trad­ing of al­gos, any real or­der flows may have a sur­pris­ingly large im­pact on prices,” Mr Peter Tchir, head of macro strat­egy at Academy Se­cu­ri­ties, wrote in a note.</p>
    <p>“By trad­ing op­tions, they lever­age their po­si­tion.”</p>
