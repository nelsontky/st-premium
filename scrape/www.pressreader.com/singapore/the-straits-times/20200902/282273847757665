    <p>ORCIERES MER­LETTE (France) • Slove­nian Pri­moz Roglic, one of the main con­tenders this year, showed no ill ef­fects of his crash ear­lier this month at the Criterum du Dauphine as he pre­vailed in the first moun­tain-top fin­ish of the Tour de France in the fourth stage, a 160.5-km ride from Sis­teron yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>His com­pa­triot Tadej Po­gacar was se­cond and French­man Guil­laume Martin was third in a sprint that fea­tured all the pre-race favourites.</p>
    <p>France’s Ju­lian Alaphilipp­e re­tained the over­all leader’s yel­low jer­sey when he took fifth place, four sec­onds in front of Bri­tain’s Adam Yates, with the Mitchel­ton–Scott rider in se­cond.</p>
    <p>Roglic, whose par­tic­i­pa­tion in the Tour was put in doubt af­ter he was forced to with­draw de­spite lead­ing the Cri­terium ahead of the fi­nal stage, eased to vic­tory to claim a 10-se­cond bonus and send an early warn­ing to his ri­vals.</p>
    <p>This was his third ca­reer stage win at the blue-riband race and the 30-year-old, who is now just seven sec­onds be­hind Alaphilipp­e of Bel­gian team De­ce­un­inck-Quick-Step, claimed he was get­ting strong.</p>
    <p>De­fend­ing cham­pion Egan Ber­nal of Ineos Gre­nadiers is a fur­ther 10 sec­onds be­hind.</p>
    <p>Roglic, leader of Dutch team Jumbo-Visma, said: “It was quite a fast day, quite hard. The guys again did a re­ally good job and I was al­ways in a good po­si­tion.</p>
    <p>“In the end, I could do a good sprint and I’m re­ally happy.</p>
    <p>“It’s the news I have to ac­cept, I don’t re­ally care about the yel­low jer­sey right now. We have to con­tinue like this.</p>
    <p>“I’m com­ing back af­ter my crash at the Dauphine. Every day, I feel a lit­tle bet­ter.”</p>
    <p>To­day’s fifth stage is a 183km ef­fort from Gap to Pri­vas.</p>
