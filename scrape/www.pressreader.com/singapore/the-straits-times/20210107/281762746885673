    <p>In­done­sia is im­pos­ing tighter re­stric­tions across Java – the coun­try’s most pop­u­lous is­land – as well as Bali for two weeks start­ing from Mon­day amid grow­ing fears of a spike in Covid-19 cases af­ter the Christ­mas and New Year hol­i­days.</p>
    <p>Busi­nesses in non-es­sen­tial sec­tors will be re­quired to op­er­ate</p>
    <p>with 75 per cent of their em­ploy­ees work­ing from home. Restau­rants and cafes can serve dine-in cus­tomers at only 25 per cent of their ca­pac­ity, while malls must close at 7pm.</p>
    <p>Places of wor­ship may hold ac­tiv­i­ties, but at only half their ca­pac­ity. Other so­cial and cul­tural ac­tiv­i­ties will be halted tem­po­rar­ily, and pub­lic fa­cil­i­ties closed.</p>
    <p>Those in es­sen­tial sec­tors and con­struc­tion projects, how­ever, may op­er­ate at full ca­pac­ity by ad­her­ing to health pro­to­cols.</p>
    <p>The re­stric­tive mea­sures will ap­ply in re­gions where the fa­tal­ity rate or the num­ber of ac­tive cases ex­ceeds the na­tional av­er­age, the re­cov­ery rate is lower than the na­tional av­er­age, and the iso­la­tion and in­ten­sive care unit bed oc­cu­pancy rate is above 70 per cent, Co­or­di­nat­ing Min­is­ter for Eco­nomic Af­fairs Air­langga Har­tarto said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The fa­tal­ity rate in the world’s fourth-most pop­u­lous na­tion of nearly 270 mil­lion is 3 per cent,</p>
    <p>while the re­cov­ery rate is 82 per cent. Ac­tive cases stand at around 14 per cent.</p>
    <p>Speak­ing af­ter a Cabi­net meet­ing led by Pres­i­dent Joko Wi­dodo, Mr Air­langga said the mea­sures were nec­es­sary af­ter weekly cases rose by 48,434 last month and 51,986 early this month.</p>
    <p>He said the gov­ern­ment will be de­ploy­ing pub­lic or­der of­fi­cers, po­lice and mil­i­tary po­lice per­son­nel to monitor the im­ple­men­ta­tion of the re­stric­tive mea­sures and the mo­bil­ity of peo­ple in the af­fected re­gions.</p>
    <p>These re­gions in­clude Jakarta and its satel­lite ci­ties in West Java and Ban­ten such as Bo­gor, De­pok, Bekasi and Tangerang; Ban­dung in West Java; Se­marang and Solo in Cen­tral Java; Yo­gyakarta; Surabaya and Malang in East Java; and Den­pasar in Bali.</p>
    <p>The lat­est move, which Mr Air­langga de­scribed as “mi­cro-scale re­stric­tions”, comes as many health fa­cil­i­ties are strug­gling to cope with mount­ing in­fec­tions.</p>
    <p>In Jakarta, 98 Covid-19 re­fer­ral hos­pi­tals have re­ported that they are nearly full, with 87 per cent of 7,379 iso­la­tion beds be­ing oc­cu­pied as at Sun­day.</p>
    <p>The au­thor­i­ties ex­pect an­other surge in cases be­cause pre­vi­ous long hol­i­day pe­ri­ods, such as be­tween Aug 20 and 23, and be­tween Oct 28 and Nov 1, trig­gered a rise in in­fec­tions in the coun­try.</p>
    <p>Speak­ing af­ter the Cabi­net meet­ing, Health Min­is­ter Budi Gu­nadi Sadikin said the num­ber of ac­tive cases had climbed by be­tween 30 per cent and 40 per cent af­ter long hol­i­days, putting more pres­sure on hos­pi­tals and health work­ers.</p>
    <p>Mr Budi pleaded with In­done­sians to re­strict their move­ments for two weeks, in line with the planned stricter mea­sures.</p>
    <p>In­done­sia, which is cop­ing with the worst Covid-19 sit­u­a­tion in South-east Asia, reg­is­tered 8,854 new cases yes­ter­day, a record high for a sin­gle day.</p>
