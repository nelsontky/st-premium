    <p>Aries (March 21 - April 19)</p>
    <p>You can­not fig­ure out what is ex­pected of you. That could mean you need to ask lots of ques­tions or that you should spend time on your own.</p>
    <p>Taurus (April 20 - May 20)</p>
    <p>You are in the mid­dle of some­thing in­tense. Oth­ers may find you harder to un­der­stand, but things should make a lot of sense to you.</p>
    <p>Gemini (May 21 - June 20)</p>
    <p>Your brainy side is com­ing out, so see if you can make use of th­ese new in­sights. You may not know ex­actly what is go­ing on, but your hunches are strong.</p>
    <p>Can­cer (June 21 - July 22)</p>
    <p>Slow down with any per­son or project that does not feel right. Your in­tu­ition may not be very spe­cific, but it will not lead you astray.</p>
    <p>Leo (July 23 - Aug 22)</p>
    <p>Share some love with your fam­ily. At least one per­son re­ally needs a lift that only you can give. It might be a good time to take on a men­tor­ing role.</p>
    <p>Virgo (Aug 23 - Sept 22)</p>
    <p>Pay closer at­ten­tion to the peo­ple in your life. At least one col­league or friend has some solid advice you have to ab­sorb. Keep lis­ten­ing.</p>
    <p>Libra (Sept 23 - Oct 22)</p>
    <p>Your stuff is get­ting on your nerves. Maybe there is too much of it, maybe it is not or­gan­ised. Whip it into shape so you do not feel com­pelled to cut and run.</p>
    <p>Scorpio (Oct 23 - Nov 21)</p>
    <p>Your in­ner and outer strengths are in sync and more pow­er­ful than ever. You feel as if you could pull off al­most any­thing and with good rea­son.</p>
    <p>Sagittariu­s (Nov 22 - Dec 21)</p>
    <p>You have to get in touch with your­self, prefer­ably at a re­ally deep level. Make sure you have the time and space to ask your­self the big ques­tions.</p>
    <p>Capricorn (Dec 22 - Jan 19)</p>
    <p>You feel re­moved from the big drama. Ei­ther you see it as the petty mad­ness it re­ally is, or that it is not re­ally your busi­ness. Fo­cus on your own is­sues.</p>
    <p>Aquarius (Jan 20 - Feb 18)</p>
    <p>You need to move for­ward, but you have some strange feel­ings hold­ing you back. Try not to get too ex­cited, but make sure you are not sab­o­tag­ing your suc­cess.</p>
    <p>Pisces (Feb 19 - March 20)</p>
    <p>You could be feeling threat­ened by some­thing or some­one, but do not panic. They can smell fear. You are in a much bet­ter si­t­u­a­tion than you imag­ine.</p>
