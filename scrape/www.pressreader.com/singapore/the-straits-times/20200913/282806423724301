    <p>TOKYO • When Sin­ga­pore’s for­mer pres­i­dent S R Nathan died in 2016, Ja­panese Prime Min­is­ter Shinzo Abe was the first for­eign leader to per­son­ally pay his re­spects at the state fu­neral.</p>
    <p>He said then that Ja­pan would never for­get the kind­ness of Mr Nathan, who was flu­ent in Ja­panese and in 2009 had be­come the first for­eign head of state to visit Hiroshima to meet atomic bomb sur­vivors.</p>
    <p>In 2015, Mr Abe had also at­tended the state fu­neral of found­ing prime min­is­ter Lee Kuan Yew, to whom he paid his high­est trib­ute for his “in­com­pa­ra­ble lead­er­ship and un­par­al­leled in­sights”.</p>
    <p>In his testimonia­l, Mr Abe cred­ited Mr Lee for play­ing “a key role not only in achiev­ing Sin­ga­pore’s re­mark­able eco­nomic growth and pros­per­ity, but also in se­cur­ing peace and sta­bil­ity of the Asia-Pa­cific re­gion and the world”.</p>
    <p>Ja­pan also posthu­mously con­ferred its high­est hon­our for for­eign dig­ni­taries – the Grand Cordon of the Or­der of the Paulow­nia Flow­ers – on Mr Lee.</p>
    <p>Both Ja­pan and Sin­ga­pore share ideals that have been ad­vanced un­der Mr Abe’s lead­er­ship since he took of­fice in De­cem­ber 2012.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore Prime Min­is­ter Lee Hsien Loong said af­ter Mr Abe’s res­ig­na­tion last month that he has worked very well with Mr Abe, un­der whose lead­er­ship bi­lat­eral ties have deep­ened.</p>
    <p>He specif­i­cally sin­gled out Mr Abe’s role in res­ur­rect­ing the Trans-Pa­cific Part­ner­ship trade pact af­ter the with­drawal of the United States. Mr Abe replied on Twit­ter that he was “pro­foundly grate­ful” to have been able to work with PM Lee to grow bi­lat­eral ties.</p>
    <p>It had been in Sin­ga­pore where, at the high-level Shangri-La se­cu­rity di­a­logue in 2014, Mr Abe elab­o­rated on Ja­pan’s plan for “proac­tive con­tri­bu­tion to peace”.</p>
    <p>The strat­egy en­ables Ja­pan’s SelfDe­fence Forces to go to the aid of friendly na­tions un­der at­tack in the name of “col­lec­tive self-de­fence”.</p>
    <p>Mr Abe stressed Ja­pan’s com­mit­ment to en­sur­ing rule of law and the free­dom of nav­i­ga­tion in the same speech.</p>
    <p>To that end, Ja­pan has taken part in re­cent joint naval pa­trols through the South China Sea with coun­tries such as the US, Bri­tain and In­dia.</p>
    <p>De­fence ties with Sin­ga­pore have also grown in re­cent years, with Ja­pan’s largest Izumo-class he­li­copter de­stroy­ers hav­ing made port calls in the Repub­lic.</p>
