    <p>More than a third of com­mon chronic med­i­cal con­di­tions in Sin­ga­pore are pre­ventable if peo­ple take charge of their health, the coun­try’s chief health sci­en­tist told a Straits Times we­bi­nar.</p>
    <p>These con­di­tions in­clude high blood pres­sure, di­a­betes and high choles­terol, Pro­fes­sor Tan Chorh Chuan said at the event to dis­cuss how Sin­ga­pore­ans can live longer and health­ier lives.</p>
    <p>About 35 per cent of the years lost due to ill-health, dis­abil­ity or pre­ma­ture death – a mea­sure called the dis­abil­ity-ad­justed life year – are due to things that are po­ten­tially mod­i­fi­able, such as smok­ing and a poor diet, said Prof Tan, who is also the ex­ec­u­tive direc­tor of the Min­istry of Health’s Of­fice for Health­care Trans­for­ma­tion.</p>
    <p>These facts came from the re­cently re­leased re­sults of the 2019 Global Bur­den of Dis­ease Study.</p>
    <p>“Even if you have an ill­ness like hy­per­ten­sion or di­a­betes, if you con­trol that well, you greatly re­duce the risk of get­ting kid­ney fail­ure or heart dis­ease,” Prof Tan said.</p>
    <p>“And if you’re un­lucky enough to have... had a stroke and you had high blood pres­sure, if you con­trol your blood pres­sure well, you can re­duce the risk of a sec­ond stroke by 20 per cent to 30 per cent. So preven­tion can work at many lev­els and still be ef­fec­tive.”</p>
    <p>Prof Tan was speak­ing on Wed­nes­day at the Keep­ing Sin­ga­pore Healthy we­bi­nar, an ST event spon­sored by Pru­den­tial Sin­ga­pore and mod­er­ated by ST se­nior health cor­re­spon­dent Salma Kha­lik.</p>
    <p>Pru­den­tial Sin­ga­pore chief ex­ec­u­tive Den­nis Tan shared sober­ing data that showed most health in­sur­ance claims sub­mit­ted to the firm are from pol­i­cy­hold­ers aged 46 to 55.</p>
    <p>“In terms of crit­i­cal ill­ness, we have ob­served that the top three rea­sons for claims would be treat­ments re­lated to heart, to stroke, as well as to kid­ney treat­ments,” he said.</p>
    <p>From time to time, Pru­den­tial Sin­ga­pore, an In­te­grated Shield plan provider, also re­ceives claims for can­cer from un­der- 35s.</p>
    <p>The Gov­ern­ment re­cently said MediShield Life pre­mi­ums for peo­ple aged 61 and above need to be raised by more than one-third so that it can cope with the 50 per cent rise in both the num­ber of claims and to­tal pay­outs for older peo­ple in the past four years.</p>
    <p>But it is not all doom and gloom. Health Pro­mo­tion Board chief ex­ec­u­tive Zee Yoong Kang, who also spoke at the we­bi­nar, said that Sin­ga­pore­ans are by some mea­sures the world’s health­i­est peo­ple when it comes to health-ad­justed life ex­pectancy or the num­ber of years one can live in good health.</p>
    <p>“Sin­ga­pore­ans have 73.9 years of health-ad­justed life years, and that’s the high­est in the world,” he said. “If you look at our diet, the amount of phys­i­cal ac­tiv­ity that we have, how much peo­ple smoke, you can see im­prove­ments over the years. Habits can, over time, shift.”</p>
    <p>To mo­ti­vate change, a com­bi­na­tion of in­cen­tives such as be­havioural ones or the use of health apps (Pru­den­tial has its Pulse app) can help.</p>
    <p>The ex­perts said it is never too late – or too early – to start health pro­mo­tion, with Prof Tan rec­om­mend­ing that it should be­gin from the womb and early child­hood.</p>
    <p>The we­bi­nar also touched on men­tal health. Prof Tan said the min­istry’s Web-based mo­bile ap­pli­ca­tion mind­line.sg can help peo­ple do self-as­sess­ments, while Mr Zee said pay­ing at­ten­tion to men­tal well­ness means chal­leng­ing times can be eas­ier to han­dle.</p>
    <p>Pru­den­tial’s Mr Tan said in­sur­ers are pay­ing a lot more at­ten­tion to men­tal health, and will con­tinue to put their re­sources into it.</p>
    <p>The firm is keen to form a part­ner­ship with the pub­lic to keep Sin­ga­pore healthy.</p>
    <p>Mr Tan said Pru­den­tial wants to help the pub­lic and pol­i­cy­hold­ers stay healthy.</p>
    <p>“The nation will be health­ier and more pro­duc­tive,” he said.</p>
    <p>“And for us as a business, in that sense, we will be health­ier as well be­cause the claims will grad­u­ally come down.”</p>
    <p>RE­DUCED RISK</p>
    <p>Even if you have an ill­ness like hy­per­ten­sion or di­a­betes, if you con­trol that well, you greatly re­duce the risk of get­ting kid­ney fail­ure or heart dis­ease.</p>
