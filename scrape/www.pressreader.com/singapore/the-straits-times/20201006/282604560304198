    <p>Why would any­body pay hun­dreds of dol­lars to eat air­plane food? I thought about this when I ac­cepted the in­vi­ta­tion to taste Sin­ga­pore Air­lines’ first and business class food, which peo­ple can now or­der.</p>
    <p>It turns out that econ­omy class trav­ellers like me have been miss­ing out big time. Would I pay $288 and $448 for this food? I can think of many things to do with that money and none of those things in­volves air­plane food.</p>
    <p>Still, if you want a taste of the luxe life, here’s what I thought.</p>
    <p>SIG­NA­TURES Sa­tay</p>
    <p>The three sticks of chicken sa­tay served in first and business class are de­li­cious, to be sure, but what’s even bet­ter is the veg­e­tar­ian op­tion, which cus­tomers who or­der San­jeev Kapoor’s veg­e­tar­ian meals will get.</p>
    <p>SIA uses Im­pos­si­ble, an Amer­i­can meat sub­sti­tute, for the veg­e­tar­ian sa­tay and cus­tomers get six sticks of it. The spic­ing is spot on and vi­brant and, frankly, it tastes bet­ter than the chicken.</p>
    <p>Caviar ser­vice</p>
    <p>This is served in first class and each pas­sen­ger or cus­tomer gets a 30g jar of Osci­etra caviar from Italy with bli­nis, creme fraiche, chives, chopped egg yolks and egg white. The bli­nis are ten­der, not rubbery as you might ex­pect, and per­fect land­ing pads for the briny caviar.</p>
    <p>Gar­lic bread</p>
    <p>It is said that pas­sen­gers wake up when the scent of gar­lic bread wafts through the cabin. I have seen the bread be­fore toast­ing and it is loaded with but­ter, gar­lic and chopped pars­ley. The slices re­heat per­fectly too.</p>
    <p>The other bread I en­joy is the rose­mary-flecked lavash that is part of the bread bas­ket. That won’t give you dragon breath.</p>
    <p>GE­ORGES BLANC’S MENU</p>
    <p>The navarin of beef short rib that I taste can­not be faulted and the meat is ten­der and juicy. But I would have liked to have tried the roasted free-range chicken breast, since that is the chef’s sig­na­ture dish. Still, the stew of olives and bell pep­pers that comes with the beef is bright and ap­petis­ing.</p>
    <p>I would pick the ch­est­nut veloute over the poached lob­ster for the ap­pe­tiser sim­ply be­cause the silky soup, with a hint of sweet from the chest­nuts, re­minds me that au­tumn is com­ing.</p>
    <p>The mango lime mint cheese­cake is not too rich, but the mango is strangely de­void of sweet­ness or tart­ness. I do not de­tect lime or mint ei­ther.</p>
    <p>MATT MO­RAN’S MENU</p>
    <p>The Aus­tralian chef’s menu looks the most in­ter­est­ing and I would have liked to have tried the crisplook­ing pork belly. Still, the duck con­fit is right for the sea­son. It sports a panko coat­ing, which gives a good crunch with­out hav­ing to pan-fry it. The beef con­somme has great depth of flavour too.</p>
    <p>The chef’s dessert, an eclair with choco­late ganache and morello cherry com­pote, is the best of the three I tried.</p>
    <p>YOSHI­HIRO MU­RATA’S MENU</p>
    <p>So much at­ten­tion is paid to the sea­sons in Ja­panese food, even for the trays served on planes. There are chrysan­the­mum leaves, which evoke au­tumn, and the slices of car­rot are shaped like maple leaves, ap­pro­pri­ate for the sea­son. The baked prawn topped with sea urchin sounds luxe but does not wow, alas. Much bet­ter is the chicken thigh with a spring onion and ginger crust.</p>
    <p>SAN­JEEV KAPOOR’S MENU</p>
    <p>The Im­pos­si­ble sa­tay served with this chef’s veg­e­tar­ian meal is stel­lar and I would or­der just the sa­tay if I could. That said, his co­conut ginger pan­cake with prawn is ex­cel­lent, ten­der and brightly spiced. The main course of pa­neer tulsi malai, served with a raft of condiments, is an ad­ven­ture for the taste buds.</p>
    <p>The white pump­kin rice pud­ding with stewed pears is creamy, dreamy good­ness, but I would have liked to try his gu­lab ja­mun cheese­cake.</p>
