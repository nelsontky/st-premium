    <p>Two Cer­tis en­force­ment of­fi­cers at­tached to the Na­tional En­vi­ron­ment Agency (NEA) were al­legedly as­saulted by a man in the vicin­ity of Can­berra Link on Mon­day evening.</p>
    <p>A blood­stained sickle was found by the po­lice near the scene of the crime.</p>
    <p>The po­lice said they were in­formed of the in­ci­dent at about 7.30pm.</p>
    <p>The 30-year-old sus­pect al­legedly punched one of­fi­cer in the face, and slashed the other on his hand and legs with a sickle.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, Min­is­ter for Sus­tain­abil­ity and the En­vi­ron­ment Grace Fu said in a Face­book post that the of­fi­cers were at­tacked af­ter is­su­ing a fine for a smok­ing of­fence.</p>
    <p>Cer­tis and NEA said the at­tack took place at the void deck of a Hous­ing Board block of flats shortly af­ter the fine was is­sued.</p>
    <p>The at­tacker was a third party who was present, but not im­pli­cated in the smok­ing en­force­ment ac­tion that had taken place ear­lier, said Cer­tis and NEA.</p>
    <p>They added that the of­fi­cers were on duty to en­force against pub­lic health of­fences, such as lit­ter­ing and smok­ing.</p>
    <p>The ac­cused fled the scene be­fore po­lice of­fi­cers ar­rived.</p>
    <p>Both en­force­ment of­fi­cers were con­scious when taken to Khoo Teck Puat Hospi­tal.</p>
    <p>One of the of­fi­cers was still re­cov­er­ing in hospi­tal yes­ter­day and was in sta­ble con­di­tion, while the other of­fi­cer re­ceived out­pa­tient treat­ment, said Cer­tis and NEA.</p>
    <p>They added that the hos­pi­talised of­fi­cer was vis­ited by man­age­ment rep­re­sen­ta­tives from the two or­gan­i­sa­tions.</p>
    <p>Through fol­low-up in­ves­tiga</p>
    <p>FULL BACK­ING FOR OF­FI­CERS</p>
    <p>tions and with the aid of im­ages from po­lice cam­eras and the two of­fi­cers’ body-worn cam­eras, of­fi­cers from Wood­lands Po­lice Di­vi­sion es­tab­lished the iden­tity of the sus­pect and ar­rested him within seven hours of the in­ci­dent.</p>
    <p>He will be charged in court to­day with vol­un­tar­ily caus­ing hurt by dan­ger­ous weapon.</p>
    <p>If con­victed, he faces a fine, a jail term of up to seven years, can­ing or any com­bi­na­tion of the three pun­ish­ments.</p>
    <p>Ms Fu said acts of vi­o­lence against of­fi­cers are taken “very se­ri­ously” and that any act of abuse against pub­lic of­fi­cers will not be tol­er­ated.</p>
    <p>“Our of­fi­cers work hard to safe­guard the well-be­ing of Sin­ga­pore­ans,” she noted.</p>
    <p>“They de­serve our re­spect, and the right to safety in dis­charg­ing their du­ties.</p>
    <p>“They must know that we’ve got their backs cov­ered. I wish the of­fi­cers a speedy re­cov­ery.”</p>
    <p>She also re­minded the pub­lic that “this is not the time to ig­nore our safe man­age­ment mea­sures”, adding that she was con­cerned to see an in­creas­ing num­ber of “fla­grant vi­o­la­tions of the rules”.</p>
    <p>“I urge you to con­tinue to ob­serve the mea­sures to keep your fam­ily and friends safe from in­fec­tion,” said Ms Fu.</p>
    <p>Po­lice in­ves­ti­ga­tions are on­go­ing. In May, a 61-year-old man ac­cused of at­tack­ing a safe dis­tanc­ing en­force­ment of­fi­cer with a sharp in­stru­ment was charged with at­tempted mur­der.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­porean Ahirrudin Al-Had Haji Ar­rifin was ac­cused of at­tack­ing the Na­tional Parks Board of­fi­cer with a knife on May 4, se­ri­ously in­jur­ing the of­fi­cer’s ch­est, arm and hand.</p>
    <p>The vic­tim and his col­league were in­stalling some signs when they came across Ahirrudin, who was cut­ting plants il­le­gally with­out a mask, said the po­lice.</p>
    <p>The ac­cused then turned ag­gres­sive when he was ap­proached, and fled on a bi­cy­cle af­ter the at­tack.</p>
    <p>Our of­fi­cers work hard to safe­guard the well-be­ing of Sin­ga­pore­ans. They de­serve our re­spect, and the right to safety in dis­charg­ing their du­ties. They must know that we’ve got their backs ’’ cov­ered.</p>
