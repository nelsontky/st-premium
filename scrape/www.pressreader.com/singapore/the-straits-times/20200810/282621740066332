    <p>The op­er­a­tor of Gallery & Co, the mu­seum store at the Na­tional Gallery Sin­ga­pore, has come un­der fire for late pay­ments amid news of its liq­ui­da­tion.</p>
    <p>The firm, ByandCo, an­nounced on the Gallery & Co Face­book page last Friday it will be pulling out af­ter more than four years of op­er­a­tion.</p>
    <p>“We are hugely de­pen­dent on tourism and re­tail. With Covid-19, both sec­tors were se­verely i mpacted,” ByandCo wrote i n the post.</p>
    <p>Sev­eral lo­cal ven­dors, whose prod­ucts are stocked at the store, voiced their dis­con­tent about the sud­den news of liq­ui­da­tion, with some claim­ing that Gallery & Co has de­faulted on pay­ments.</p>
    <p>Lo­cal de­sign la­bel Lit­tle Drom Store posted on its so­cial me­dia chan­nels last Thursday that it was owed pay­ments to the tune of $12,000, for goods sold since</p>
    <p>Novem­ber last year.</p>
    <p>About $30,000 worth of prod­ucts re­main in the store, it added. The la­bel is known for its nos­tal­gic, Sin­ga­pore-in­spired pins and ac­ces­sories.</p>
    <p>Co-founder Stan­ley Tan told The Straits Times that, look­ing back now, there were “red flags”.</p>
    <p>It started sup­ply­ing items to Gallery & Co on whole­sale terms in May 2016, but was “con­vinced by G&C’s buyer to switch to con­sign­ment, on credit terms, for a bet­ter mar­gin” in June 2018, said Mr Tan. “Two months i nto the con­sign­ment, pay­ments started to come in late and snow­ball.”</p>
    <p>Af­ter pay­ment stopped in Novem­ber, Lit­tle Drom Store con­tin­ued to chase up un­til March this year, but was met with the re­quest for “a 30-day ex­ten­sion for pay­ment due to Covid-19”.</p>
    <p>“We were in­formed that they will re­open in July and all pay­ments would be cleared then,” he added.</p>
    <p>“It did not cross our mind then that they were fac­ing any fi­nan­cial trouble. In hind­sight, we re­alised that they were al­ready fac­ing is­sues be­fore Covid-19 hap­pened. That was why they con­vinced us to switch to credit terms in 2018, to help with their cash flow.”</p>
    <p>A lo­cal dis­trib­u­tor of an in­ter­na­tional brand of mer­chan­dise to Gallery & Co, who spoke on con­di­tion of anonymity, also faced is­sues with non-pay­ment. The dis­trib­u­tor told ST that since the an­nounce­ment, sev­eral sup­pli­ers had writ­ten to Gallery & Co and their liq­uida­tors chas­ing for in­for­ma­tion.</p>
    <p>A cred­i­tors’ meet­ing has been sched­uled for Thursday and cred­i­tors have to sub­mit pa­per­work by tomorrow, the dis­trib­u­tor said.</p>
    <p>ST un­der­stands that the liq­uida­tors are cur­rently still as­sess­ing the sit­u­a­tion. Perun Con­sul­tants, who is han­dling the liq­ui­da­tion, did not re­spond to queries as of press time.</p>
    <p>Gallery & Co opened in Novem­ber 2015 with the open­ing of Na­tional Gallery Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>It was founded by hote­lier and restau­ra­teur Loh Lik Peng, For­eign Pol­icy De­sign Group cre­ative di­rec­tors Yu Yah-Leng and Arthur Chin, and man­ag­ing di­rec­tor of cos­met­ics dis­trib­u­tor Lux­a­sia, Mr Al­wyn Chong.</p>
    <p>ByandCo added in its Face­book post: “All of us are en­trepreneur­s who risked our cap­i­tal and liveli­hood to pur­sue our pas­sions. We wish this had ended on bet­ter terms.”</p>
    <p>A rep­re­sen­ta­tive from the gallery con­firmed that the store and cafe­te­ria will re­main un­der the Gallery & Co brand, but be run by a dif­fer­ent op­er­a­tor.</p>
    <p>Both store and cafe­te­ria have been closed since April, when the cir­cuit breaker took ef­fect.</p>
    <p>She added: “We hope to re­sume oper­a­tions for the mu­seum store and cafe­te­ria as soon as pos­si­ble.”</p>
    <p>Lit­tle Drom Store’s Mr Tan sim­ply hopes for a “fair out­come – to be fully paid for what is owed and to be able to col­lect our re­main­ing goods asap”.</p>
    <p>Stress­ing his frus­tra­tion, he added: “With liq­ui­da­tion in place, my con­cerns are that we as sup­pli­ers would not be fairly treated and would be the last pri­or­ity.”</p>
