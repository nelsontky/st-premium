    <p>•</p>
    <p>Bri­tish busi­ness groups pleaded with the gov­ern­ment to ex­tend the time they have to pre­pare for the na­tion’s de­par­ture from the Euro­pean Union af­ter lead­ers from both sides agreed to con­tinue talks.</p>
    <p>Bri­tish Prime Min­is­ter Boris John­son and Euro­pean Com­mis­sion pres­i­dent Ur­sula von der Leyen on Sun­day gave ne­go­tia­tors an­other shot at reach­ing a deal on the terms of trade be­fore the Brexit tran­si­tion pe­riod ends on Dec 31.</p>
    <p>Lobby groups re­sponded with re­lief at the prospect that the sides may yet avoid a no-deal di­vorce, which would mean the ap­pli­ca­tion of costly tar­iffs and quo­tas.</p>
    <p>The raft of changes that Brexit en­tails – from li­cens­ing stan­dards to pa­per­work re­quire­ments – means Bri­tish firms have a lot of work ahead to ad­just to their new re­la­tion­ship with the na­tion’s big­gest trad­ing part­ner.</p>
    <p>“Gov­ern­ment must move with even more de­ter­mi­na­tion to avoid the loom­ing cliff edge of Jan 1,” Mr Tony Danker, direc­tor-gen­eral of the Con­fed­er­a­tion of Bri­tish In­dus­try, said.</p>
    <p>Bri­tish and EU ne­go­tia­tors will try to forge a deal over the next few days, and if talks make progress, it is pos­si­ble an agree­ment could be struck by the mid­dle of the week, peo­ple on both sides said.</p>
    <p>Though Britain voted to leave the EU more than four years ago, trade talks have come down to the wire as politi­cians hag­gle over key is­sues. Firms, mean­while, have to try to adapt to life be­yond Dec 31 with­out know­ing the fun­da­men­tal rules of en­gage­ment.</p>
    <p>“This is about pol­i­tics now. It is very dif­fi­cult for busi­ness,” said Mr Mark Price, a for­mer trade min­is­ter and past deputy chair­man of the John Lewis Part­ner­ship.</p>
    <p>Of­fi­cials have yet to de­cide how firms should deal with bu­reau­cratic headaches such as how to com­ply with rules of ori­gin or han­dle dif­fer­ing prod­uct stan­dards.</p>
    <p>Im­ports have al­ready been dis­rupted due to high vol­umes of traf­fic at ports linked to Covid-19 and Brexit-re­lated stock­pil­ing.</p>
    <p>“The UK has more to lose than us on trans­port in the case of a nodeal. I hope we can get to an agree­ment that will be nec­es­sary for the UK to en­sure their sup­ply chain,” French Trans­port Min­is­ter JeanBap­tiste Djeb­bari said yesterday.</p>
    <p>Britain’s man­u­fac­tur­ing in­dus­try also warned of a po­ten­tial “knock­out blow” if a Brexit deal can­not be se­cured in time.</p>
    <p>Make UK, the trade body for Bri­tish manufactur­ers, said it was slash­ing its growth fore­cast for the sec­tor next year to 2.7 per cent, from 5.1 per cent just three months ago – roughly half the rate of growth it sees for the broader econ­omy.</p>
    <p>“Com­bined with the pan­demic, many in in­dus­try are feel­ing like an ex­hausted boxer in the fi­nal round of a bout, with a no-deal exit from the EU po­ten­tially land­ing a knock­out blow,” its chief ex­ec­u­tive Stephen Phip­son said.</p>
    <p>Of­fi­cial data last week showed that Bri­tish fac­tory out­put in Oc­to­ber was 7.1 per cent be­low its level a year ear­lier.</p>
    <p>If the talks fail, Britain and the EU would re­vert to com­mer­cial rules set by the World Trade Or­gan­i­sa­tion, which would mean new tar­iffs and Cus­toms con­trols.</p>
    <p>Shops would pass on ex­tra costs from new tar­iffs to cus­tomers, mean­ing “it will be the pub­lic that pay the price of this fail­ure”, Bri­tish Re­tail Con­sor­tium chief Helen Dick­in­son said.</p>
    <p>As talks con­tin­ued yesterday, Dr von der Leyen ex­pressed sat­is­fac­tion over some progress made.</p>
    <p>“We are talk­ing about a new be­gin­ning with old friends,” she told a con­fer­ence or­gan­ised by the Or­gan­i­sa­tion for Eco­nomic Co­op­er­a­tion and Devel­op­ment.</p>
    <p>“We are on the very last mile to go. But it is an es­sen­tial one. We want a level play­ing field, not only at the start but also over time.”</p>
