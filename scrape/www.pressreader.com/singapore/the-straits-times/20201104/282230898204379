    <p>Two high-level in­ter-agency mar­itime se­cu­rity ex­er­cises were car­ried out re­cently to make sure Sin­ga­pore con­tin­ues to be ready for po­ten­tial ter­ror­ist at­tacks amid the on­go­ing coro­n­avirus pan­demic.</p>
    <p>In part due to Covid-19 curbs that pre­vent large groups from gath­er­ing, the agen­cies co­or­di­nated some ac­tiv­i­ties us­ing video­con­fer­enc­ing tools.</p>
    <p>The first, Ex­er­cise Highcrest, was held from Oct 26 to 30, with sim­u­lated at­tacks on Sin­ga­pore’s key coastal in­stal­la­tions.</p>
    <p>Per­son­nel from the Repub­lic of Sin­ga­pore Navy, the po­lice, the Sin­ga­pore Civil De­fence Force, the Im­mi­gra­tion and Check­points Au­thor­ity, Sin­ga­pore Cus­toms and the Mar­itime and Port Au­thor­ity of Sin­ga­pore worked to­gether to neu­tralise the threats.</p>
    <p>They re­hearsed man­ag­ing the af­ter­math of such at­tacks, which in­cluded man­ag­ing mar­itime traf­fic, said the Min­istry of De­fence in a press state­ment yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The sec­ond, Ex­er­cise Apex, started on Mon­day and will end to­day.</p>
    <p>De­ployed forces from the Mar­itime Se­cu­rity Task Force, Spe­cial Op­er­a­tions Task Force, Chem­i­cal, Bi­o­log­i­cal, Ra­di­o­log­i­cal and Ex­plo­sive De­fence Group per­son­nel, In­de­pen­dence-class lit­toral mis­sion ves­sel RSS Unity, mul­ti­ple Su­per Puma heli­copters and a Heron 1 un­manned ae­rial ve­hi­cle were tasked to re­cap­ture a merchant ves­sel hi­jacked by ter­ror­ists.</p>
    <p>Mar­itime Se­cu­rity Task Force Com­man­der Yong Wei Hsiung said: “We must en­sure our na­tional mar­itime se­cu­rity sys­tem is ro­bust and ready at all times to deal with any threats quickly and de­ci­sively. Through the tight-knit col­lab­o­ra­tion, I am as­sured that we can con­tinue to keep our coun­try safe against mar­itime se­cu­rity threats, even amid the on­go­ing Covid-19 pan­demic.”</p>
    <p>The pan­demic has thrown a span­ner in the works of Sin­ga­pore’s de­fence op­er­a­tions. In ad­di­tion to the sus­pen­sion of in­di­vid­ual phys­i­cal pro­fi­ciency tests (IPPT) and in-camp train­ing (ICT) for op­er­a­tionally ready na­tional ser­vice­men (NS­men) ear­lier in the year, joint ex­er­cises with for­eign mil­i­taries have also had to be can­celled or al­tered.</p>
    <p>A joint mar­itime ex­er­cise in Septem­ber be­tween the Sin­ga­pore and Aus­tralian navies was con­ducted with no phys­i­cal in­ter­ac­tion be­tween per­son­nel from the two coun­tries, while the Sin­ga­pore Armed Forces (SAF) in May said it had suspended all large-scale over­seas ex­er­cises be­cause of the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>De­fence Min­is­ter Ng Eng Hen said the de­liv­ery of sub­marines and heli­copters that the SAF has pur­chased will be delayed.</p>
    <p>More than 6,000 ser­vice­men and women have been mo­bilised for the na­tional fight against Covid-19, in­clud­ing for the run­ning of for­eign worker dor­mi­to­ries and con­tact trac­ing op­er­a­tions.</p>
    <p>READY AT ALL TIMES</p>
    <p>We must en­sure our na­tional mar­itime se­cu­rity sys­tem is ro­bust and ready at all times to deal with any threats quickly and de­ci­sively. Through the tight-knit col­lab­o­ra­tion, I am as­sured that we can con­tinue to keep our coun­try safe against mar­itime se­cu­rity threats, even amid the on­go­ing Covid-19 pan­demic.</p>
