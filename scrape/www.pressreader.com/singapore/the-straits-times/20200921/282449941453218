    <p>NEW YORK • Ortho­static hy­poten­sion refers to a brief but pre­cip­i­tous drop in blood pres­sure that causes light-head­ed­ness or dizzi­ness when stand­ing up af­ter ly­ing down or sit­ting, and some­times even af­ter stand­ing, for a pro­longed pe­riod.</p>
    <p>The prob­lem is likely to be fa­mil­iar to peo­ple of all ages, but mid­dleaged and older adults are most fre­quently af­fected.</p>
    <p>Ortho­static hy­poten­sion is also a risk fac­tor for strokes and heart at­tacks. It can be an early warn­ing sign of a se­ri­ous un­der­ly­ing car­dio­vas­cu­lar or neu­ro­log­i­cal dis­or­der.</p>
    <p>Un­der nor­mal cir­cum­stances, when we stand up, grav­ity tem­po­rar­ily causes blood to pool in the lower half of the body; then, within 20 or 30 sec­onds, re­cep­tors in the heart and carotid ar­ter­ies in the neck trig­ger a com­pen­sat­ing mech­a­nism called the barore­flex that raises the heart rate and con­stricts blood ves­sels to in­crease blood pres­sure and pro­vide the brain with an ad­e­quate sup­ply of blood.</p>
    <p>In peo­ple with ortho­static hy­poten­sion, this re­flex mech­a­nism is de­layed or in­suf­fi­cient, re­sult­ing in such symp­toms as light­head­ed­ness, dizzi­ness or faint­ing.</p>
    <p>The dis­or­der is of­fi­cially de­fined as a drop in sys­tolic blood pres­sure (the top num­ber) of 20 or more mil­lime­tres of mer­cury or a drop of 10 or more in di­as­tolic pres­sure (the bot­tom num­ber) within three min­utes of stand­ing up­right.</p>
    <p>How­ever, a study of 11,429 mid­dle-aged adults fol­lowed for up to 23 years found that blood pres­sure mea­sure­ments taken within one minute of stand­ing were even more strongly re­lated to dizzi­ness, falls, frac­tures, mo­tor ve­hi­cle ac­ci­dents and death than record­ings done af­ter three min­utes.</p>
    <p>“Some pa­tients re­cover and you may miss the prob­lem when you wait three min­utes to mea­sure blood pres­sure,” said Dr Stephen Juraschek, an in­ternist at Beth Is­rael Dea­coness Med­i­cal Cen­tre in Bos­ton and as­sis­tant pro­fes­sor of medicine at Harvard Med­i­cal School, who di­rected the study.</p>
    <p>He said that while ortho­static hy­poten­sion is com­monly re­garded as a neu­ro­log­i­cal prob­lem, “it’s as­so­ci­ated with a lot of sub-clin­i­cal car­dio­vas­cu­lar pathol­ogy, which is prob­a­bly the largest con­trib­u­tor”.</p>
    <p>Dr Lewis Lip­sitz, geri­a­tri­cian and di­rec­tor of the Mar­cus In­sti­tute for Age­ing Re­search in Bos­ton, said peo­ple with es­pe­cially high blood pres­sure are more sus­cep­ti­ble to ortho­static hy­poten­sion be­cause hy­per­ten­sion im­pairs the heart’s abil­ity to pump blood, thick­ens blood ves­sels that then can­not con­strict and im­pairs kid­ney func­tion.</p>
    <p>“Ev­ery pa­tient on med­i­ca­tion to lower blood pres­sure should be checked pe­ri­od­i­cally for ortho­static hy­poten­sion dur­ing rou­tine of­fice vis­its,” he said.</p>
    <p>He sug­gested that pa­tients lie down for three to five min­utes, then have re­peated blood pres­sure checks done, in the first 20 to 30 sec­onds, af­ter one minute and again af­ter three min­utes of stand­ing up.</p>
    <p>He ex­plained that when a per­son stands up, about 500ml of blood pools in the legs and belly. In older peo­ple, the in­crease in heart rate and blood ves­sel con­stric­tion needed to com­pen­sate this is less ef­fec­tive.</p>
    <p>Rec­om­mended treat­ments in­clude wear­ing com­pres­sion stock­ings and an ab­dom­i­nal bin­der (a gir­dle) to re­duce the pool­ing of blood upon stand­ing. Also help­ful is avoid­ing pro­longed or mo­tion­less stand­ing, as well as hot baths or show­ers.</p>
