    <p>LON­DON • Le­ices­ter man­ager Bren­dan Rodgers be­lieves that their en­tire sea­son boils down to their fi­nal Premier League match at home to Manchester United on Sun­day – even if the Red Devils win their game in hand against West Ham.</p>
    <p>When the Foxes won eight suc­ces­sive English top-flight games between Oc­to­ber and De­cem­ber, they looked odds-on for a top-four fin­ish for the first time since win­ning the league in 2016 and at one point, even looked ca­pa­ble of chas­ing Liver­pool for the ti­tle.</p>
    <p>But they have fallen away badly, win­ning just five times in the league this year and their poor form was again ev­i­dent on Sun­day in a 3-0 loss at Tot­ten­ham.</p>
    <p>An early own goal by James Justin set the tone for a tor­rid af­ter­noon be­fore a dou­ble by Harry Kane gave Spurs re­newed hope of qual­i­fy­ing for the Europa League.</p>
    <p>While Jose Mour­inho’s side will stay in sixth place and among the qual­i­fi­ca­tion spots re­gard­less of the mid­week games, the same can­not be said about Le­ices­ter and their chances of Cham­pi­ons League foot­ball.</p>
    <p>They re­main fourth but are level on 62 points with fifth-placed United, who can open up a three­p­oint lead if they beat West Ham to­mor­row.</p>
    <p>Ole Gun­nar Sol­sk­jaer’s men could also es­tab­lish a goal-dif­fer­ence ad­van­tage with a healthy win over the Ham­mers – both United and Le­ices­ter are on plus 28 – which would mean the hosts will not only need to come away with a vic­tory on Sun­day, but make up any goal dif­fer­ence as well.</p>
    <p>That will be a tough ask, given that Le­ices­ter will be miss­ing James Mad­di­son, Ben Chilwell and Chris­tian Fuchs through in­jury, while Caglar Soyuncu is also banned.</p>
    <p>But Rodgers is re­main­ing op­ti­mistic ahead of the clash and feels no mat­ter what hap­pens, his play­ers have over­achieved this term as Cham­pi­ons League am­bi­tions had not fig­ured in their thoughts at the start of the cam­paign.</p>
    <p>“It will be ab­so­lutely per­fect. It will be all in,” he said af­ter the de­feat by Spurs.</p>
    <p>“The play­ers have been fan­tas­tic. We’ve got one last op­por­tu­nity. What­ever the re­sult was to­day, we needed a (good) re­sult next week.</p>
    <p>“I al­ways felt that no mat­ter how well you do, there will al­ways be dis­ap­point­ment. Oth­ers will be grat­i­fied with the work done over the past 17 months to be in this po­si­tion. I know there will be both feel­ings.”</p>
    <p>While he ad­mit­ted his men were</p>
    <p>“leggy” at Tot­ten­ham, they now have a full week to re­cover, un­like United.</p>
    <p>“The play­ers, what they’ve done in the past 17 months, to put them­selves in this po­si­tion, it’s bril­liant,” the North­ern Ir­ish­man added. “I don’t want to be too neg­a­tive.</p>
    <p>“We go into a game with a fan­tas­tic chance to get into the Cham­pi­ons League. Top six was the aim, which you guys (the crit­ics) would ad­mit would be a fan­tas­tic achieve­ment.”</p>

The Foxes are likely to have to beat Manchester United by more than a goal in their fi&#xAD;nal game to make the Cham&#xAD;pi&#xAD;ons League.</p>
