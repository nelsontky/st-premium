    <p>Changi Air­port will open up fur­ther to tran­sit pas­sen­gers, with Jet­star Asia an­nounc­ing yes­ter­day that those on its flights from six South-east Asian cities will be able to tran­sit via Sin­ga­pore to other des­ti­na­tions from Dec 1.</p>
    <p>It is the fourth air­line al­lowed to op­er­ate such tran­sit flights af­ter the three air­lines un­der the Sin­ga­pore Air­lines (SIA) Group – SIA, Scoot and SilkAir – be­gan do­ing so in Au­gust.</p>
    <p>Such a move is ex­pected to give traf­fic at Changi Air­port a small boost, although avi­a­tion ex­perts have said that de­mand for these flights will likely re­main low, given con­tin­ued re­stric­tions on in­ter­na­tional travel and the lack of a mean­ing­ful travel bub­ble in South-east Asia.</p>
    <p>The tran­sit flights ap­ply to Jet­star Asia pas­sen­gers de­part­ing from Bangkok, Ho Chi Minh City, Jakarta, Kuala Lumpur, Pe­nang and Ph­nom Penh.</p>
    <p>Those tran­sit­ing will have to wear a wrist­band through­out their jour­ney so they can be iden­ti­fied by air­port and air­line staff.</p>
    <p>Jet­star Asia said they will, as far as pos­si­ble, be kept sep­a­rate from other pas­sen­gers by be­ing seated to­gether near the front of the air­craft.</p>
    <p>They will dis­em­bark from the planes first and board last, and will be kept at a tran­sit hold­ing area or ho­tel dur­ing their time in Sin­ga­pore, which must not ex­ceed 48 hours.</p>
    <p>But those ar­riv­ing from Viet­nam will be ex­empted from these reg­u­la­tions as it is one of the coun­tries Sin­ga­pore has de­cided to uni­lat­er­ally lift bor­der re­stric­tions.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore did so last month af­ter as­sess­ing that visi­tors from Viet­nam were un­likely to have the coro­n­avirus due to the coun­try’s pub­lic health sur­veil­lance sys­tem and low in­fec­tion rates.</p>
    <p>Visi­tors from Viet­nam are able to go about their ac­tiv­i­ties in Sin­ga­pore af­ter a neg­a­tive Covid-19 swab test upon ar­rival here and need not serve a stay-home no­tice.</p>
    <p>The tran­sit flights are a “pos­i­tive step in the air­line’s re­cov­ery”, said Jet­star Asia chief ex­ec­u­tive of­fi­cer Bara Pa­su­pathi.</p>
    <p>The bud­get car­rier had cut a quar­ter of its Sin­ga­pore-based work­force, in­clud­ing 220 pi­lots, in July, and re­tired five of its air­craft.</p>
    <p>It now has a to­tal fleet of 13 air­craft that fly to nine cities.</p>
    <p>At its peak, trans­fer and tran­sit pas­sen­gers ac­counted for about a third of Changi’s pas­sen­ger traf­fic. Cur­rent lev­els re­main far short of that.</p>
