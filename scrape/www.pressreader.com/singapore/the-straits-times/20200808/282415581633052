    <p>• For­mula One ste­wards yes­ter­day stripped Rac­ing Point of 15 points in the con­struc­tors’ stand­ings and fined them €400,000 (S$648,000) af­ter up­hold­ing a Re­nault protest about the le­gal­ity of their car.</p>
    <p>The French car maker had protested at the last three races, ar­gu­ing that the brake ducts used by the Bri­tish-based team were a copy of those used by Mercedes, their en­gine part­ner, en route to win­ning last year’s cham­pi­onship.</p>
    <p>Mo­tor sports’ gov­ern­ing body, the FIA, said the ste­wards agreed the com­plaints were valid, hand­ing Rac­ing Point, whose RP20 car has been dubbed the “Pink Mercedes”, a stiff penalty. Cana­dian Lance Stroll and Mex­i­can Ser­gio Perez, will, how­ever, keep their points in the driv­ers’ stand­ings.</p>
    <p>The team, owned by a con­sor­tium led by Cana­dian bil­lion­aire Lawrence Stroll, were also re­minded of their right to ap­peal un­der cer­tain cir­cum­stances.</p>
    <p>Team boss Ot­mar Szaf­nauer later told Sky Sports: “The good news from the judg­ment was that the car is com­pletely le­gal from a tech­ni­cal per­spec­tive so we can con­tinue to run the brake ducts.</p>
    <p>“Other teams have done ex­actly the same, prob­a­bly even more than what we did in a way. It’s a bit be­wil­der­ing, how­ever we now have to de­cide whether our pu­n­ish­ment is one that we should ap­peal.”</p>
    <p>F1 ste­wards claimed that the fine and points de­duc­tion – 7.5 points per car from the orig­i­nal protest at the Steier­mark Grand Prix – would be suf­fi­cient pu­n­ish­ment and the team would not have to re­design their car.</p>
    <p>They added the penalty was “in­tended to pe­nalise the po­ten­tial ad­van­tage Rac­ing Point may have ac­crued in the brake duct de­sign process” but ac­knowl­edged it was not re­al­is­tic to ex­pect the team to “un­learn” what they al­ready knew.</p>
    <p>They also em­pha­sised the breach was one of the sport­ing reg­u­la­tions rather than non-com­pli­ance with the tech­ni­cal rules and, there­fore, dis­qual­i­fi­ca­tion from the cham­pi­onship was not con­sid­ered.</p>
    <p>Rac­ing Point were in fifth place on 42 points, 10 points ahead of Re­nault, but the penalty means they swop places with their ri­vals, who now have a five-point ad­van­tage.</p>
    <p>The rep­ri­mand was not the only blow of the day for the team, af­ter Perez again tested pos­i­tive for Covid-19 af­ter a seven-day quar­an­tine. Last week, the Mex­i­can be­came the first F1 driver to be in­fected by the virus, with his spot at the Bri­tish Grand Prix taken by Nico Hulken­berg. The Ger­man will con­tinue to act as his stand-in at tomorrow’s 70th An­niver­sary GP at Sil­ver­stone af­ter Rac­ing Point con­firmed Perez’s failed test.</p>
    <p>The team said yes­ter­day. “Ser­gio is phys­i­cally well and re­cov­er­ing.”</p>
