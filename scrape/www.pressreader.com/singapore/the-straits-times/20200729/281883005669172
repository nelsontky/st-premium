    <p>SYD­NEY • A video of a fe­male law­maker wear­ing a garbage bag to protest against what she called “rub­bish” com­ments on her clothes has gone vi­ral in Aus­tralia and drawn sup­port from across the po­lit­i­cal spec­trum.</p>
    <p>The video shows Ms Ni­colle Flint of the rul­ing Lib­eral Party ask­ing whether peo­ple are “sick of sex­ist garbage” be­fore call­ing out a columnist who com­mented on her ap­pear­ance. Ms Flint then opens her coat to re­veal the plas­tic sack.</p>
    <p>Ra­dio host Peter Go­ers had writ­ten about Ms Flint’s “vast wardrobe of blaz­ers, coats and tight, black, an­kle-freez­ing trousers and stiletto heels” in his Sun­day news­pa­per col­umn.</p>
    <p>“I’ve put up with a lot as a woman in pol­i­tics,” says Ms Flint, the MP for Boothby in South Aus­tralia, in the video.</p>
    <p>It has been viewed over 220,000 times since it was posted to Twit­ter and Face­book on Mon­day.</p>
    <p>She said she had dealt with a male stalker and seen her of­fice van­dalised with the word “pros­ti­tute” since be­com­ing a politi­cian.</p>
    <p>“So, Mr Go­ers, what I want to know is, what should a woman in pol­i­tics wear? How about a garbage bag to match your rub­bish views,” Ms Flint says in the video as she re­moves her coat to re­veal the bag with a match­ing belt.</p>
    <p>The post drew ap­plause from other politi­cians, in­clud­ing the for­mer premier of Queens­land state, Mr Camp­bell New­man, who wrote:</p>
    <p>“Well done! #Garbage­likeGo­ers”.</p>
    <p>“The stan­dards ex­pected of women politi­cians are garbage,” law­maker Anika Wells from the ri­val La­bor Party said in sup­port of Ms Flint.</p>
    <p>Mr Go­ers did not re­spond to a re­quest for com­ment yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>In 2012, a fiery par­lia­men­tary speech made by Aus­tralia’s first fe­male prime min­is­ter Ju­lia Gil­lard, in which she called out sex­ism in the coun­try’s pol­i­tics and de­scribed then op­po­si­tion leader Tony Ab­bott as a misog­y­nist, be­came an In­ter­net hit.</p>
    <p>Her speech prompted Aus­tralia’s Mac­quarie Dic­tio­nary, the author­ity on the English lan­guage in the coun­try, to broaden the def­i­ni­tion of misog­yny.</p>
