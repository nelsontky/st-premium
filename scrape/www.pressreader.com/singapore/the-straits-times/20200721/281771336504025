    <p>LON­DON • Pro­fes­sor Chris Whitty, Bri­tain’s chief med­i­cal ad­viser, stood be­fore an au­di­to­rium in a Lon­don mu­seum two years ago cat­a­logu­ing deadly epi­demics.</p>
    <p>From the Black Death of the 14th cen­tury to cholera in wartorn Ye­men, it was a bale­ful his­tory.</p>
    <p>But Prof Whitty, who had spent most of his ca­reer fight­ing in­fec­tious dis­eases in Africa, was re­as­sur­ing.</p>
    <p>“Be­ing rich,” he ex­plained, would pro­tect Bri­tain.</p>
    <p>Wealth “mas­sively hard­ens a so­ci­ety against epi­demics”, he ar­gued, and qual­ity of life – food, hous­ing, wa­ter and health­care – was more ef­fec­tive than any medicine at stop­ping the dis­eases that rav­aged the de­vel­op­ing world.</p>
    <p>His con­fi­dence was hardly unique. As re­cently as Fe­bru­ary, when Euro­pean health min­is­ters met in Brus­sels to dis­cuss the coro­n­avirus emerg­ing in China, they com­mended their own health sys­tems and promised to send aid to poor coun­tries.</p>
    <p>“Re­spon­si­bil­ity is in­cum­bent on us, not only for Italy and Europe, but also for the African con­ti­nent,” said Italy’s Health Min­is­ter Roberto Sper­anza.</p>
    <p>Barely a month later, the con­ti­nent was over­whelmed. In­stead of merely pro­vid­ing aid to for­mer colonies, Western Europe be­came an epi­cen­tre of the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Of­fi­cials once boast­ful about their pre­pared­ness were fran­ti­cally try­ing to se­cure pro­tec­tive gear and ma­te­ri­als for tests, as death rates soared i n Bri­tain, France, Spain, Italy and Bel­gium. This was not sup­posed to hap­pen.</p>
    <p>Many Euro­pean lead­ers felt so se­cure af­ter the last pan­demic – the 2009 swine flu – that they scaled back stock­piles of equip­ment and faulted med­i­cal ex­perts for over­re­act­ing.</p>
    <p>They boasted of the su­pe­ri­or­ity of their world-class health sys­tems but had weak­ened them with a decade of cut­backs.</p>
    <p>Thou­sands of pages of na­tional pan­demic plan­ning turned out to be lit­tle more than ex­er­cises in bu­reau­cratic busy work.</p>
    <p>Math­e­mat­i­cal mod­els used to pre­dict pan­demic spreads – and to shape gov­ern­ment pol­icy – fed a false sense of se­cu­rity.</p>
    <p>Na­tional stock­piles of med­i­cal sup­plies were re­vealed to ex­ist mostly on pa­per, con­sist­ing in large part of “just in time” con­tracts with man­u­fac­tur­ers in China.</p>
    <p>Sir David King, a for­mer Bri­tish chief sci­en­tific ad­viser, said: “The word ‘ar­ro­gance’ comes to mind, I am afraid... What hubris.”</p>
    <p>The ex­perts had drawn up their plans based on the 2009 swine flu that in­fected hun­dreds and killed dozens in Mex­ico.</p>
    <p>Bri­tain’s swine flu pan­demic plans es­ti­mated that more than 1.3 mil­lion peo­ple could be hos­pi­talised and 800,000 could die.</p>
    <p>Try­ing to con­tain the pan­demic “would be a waste of pub­lic health re­sources”.</p>
    <p>Th­ese dooms­day sce­nar­ios drew on a new sub-spe­cial­ity of epi­demi­ol­ogy pi­o­neered by Bri­tish sci­en­tists – us­ing ab­struse math­e­mat­i­cal mod­els to project the path of a con­ta­gious dis­ease.</p>
    <p>Some ex­perts now say Europe learnt the wrong les­son from the swine flu.</p>
    <p>“It cre­ated some kind of com­pla­cency,” said Pro­fes­sor Steven Van Gucht, a vi­rol­o­gist in­volved in the Bel­gian re­sponse. “Oh, a pan­demic again? We have a good health sys­tem. We can cope with this.”</p>
    <p>Dr Em­manuel An­dre, who spent years fight­ing epi­demics in Africa be­fore ad­vis­ing Bel­gium on the coro­n­avirus, said: “They keep on telling (African) coun­tries what they should do, very clearly.</p>
    <p>“But all th­ese ex­perts, when it hap­pens in your own coun­tries? There’s noth­ing.”</p>
    <p>He added: “One les­son to learn is hu­mil­ity.”</p>
