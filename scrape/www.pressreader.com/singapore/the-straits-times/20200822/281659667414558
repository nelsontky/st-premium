    <p>The au­thor­i­ties here are work­ing with their Chi­nese coun­ter­parts to pro­vide feed­back on trav­ellers re­turn­ing to China who have been deemed non-in­fec­tious by Sin­ga­pore, but have a pos­i­tive Covid-19 poly­merase chain re­ac­tion (PCR) test re­sult.</p>
    <p>At a vir­tual press con­fer­ence yes­ter­day, the Health Min­istry’s di­rec­tor of med­i­cal ser­vices Ken­neth Mak said some may be re­cov­ered Covid-19 pa­tients who are no longer in­fec­tious, but con­tinue to shed frag­ments of the coro­n­avirus.</p>
    <p>A re­porter for China Cen­tral Tele­vi­sion had cited an in­ci­dent in which re­turn­ing work­ers who were cleared of the virus later tested pos­i­tive for Covid-19, and asked the multi-min­istry task force if there were dif­fer­ences in the tests used by the two coun­tries.</p>
    <p>“On oc­ca­sion, some of these work­ers may still have a pos­i­tive PCR test, but all other tests done for them show that they are no longer in­fec­tious,” said As­so­ciate Pro­fes­sor Mak.</p>
    <p>“We have no prob­lems in cer­ti­fy­ing them fit for travel.”</p>
    <p>He said the Chi­nese au­thor­i­ties will flag such trav­ellers as be­ing PCR pos­i­tive. In such an event, the cases are raised to the Sin­ga­pore au­thor­i­ties, who will give feed­back to their Chi­nese coun­ter­parts.</p>
    <p>Prof Mak said Sin­ga­pore is com­mit­ted to help­ing work­ers re­turn to their home coun­tries.</p>
    <p>“We want to make sure that they have ev­ery op­por­tu­nity to re­turn home to see their fam­ily whom they have not seen for quite a long while,” he said.</p>
    <p>The Chi­nese Em­bassy here ear­lier an­nounced on its web­site that trav­ellers from Sin­ga­pore would have to pro­duce a neg­a­tive Covid-19 test re­sult be­fore board­ing the plane.</p>
    <p>Health Min­is­ter Gan Kim Yong said that the lo­cal au­thor­i­ties would work with the Chi­nese Em­bassy to fa­cil­i­tate testing.</p>
    <p>Prof Mak noted: “Once these Chi­nese trav­ellers are back in China, it is the pre­rog­a­tive of our col­leagues (there) to de­cide how to... man­age them.</p>
    <p>“And at this point in time, I un­der­stand that a number of these in­di­vid­u­als might still be put un­der quar­an­tine and iso­la­tion in an abun­dance of cau­tion.”</p>
