    <p>Han Fook Kwang Ed­i­tor-at-Large</p>
    <p>Ev­ery now and then, some­thing hap­pens which tells you a bit about the coun­try, its peo­ple and how things have changed, or not.</p>
    <p>The case of Ms Parti Liyani, for­mer maid of Mr Liew Mun Leong, who had been con­victed ear­lier of steal­ing from her em­ployer but had the de­ci­sion over­turned on ap­peal, is one such ex­am­ple.</p>
    <p>There are in­sights and lessons that can be drawn from it, and, to bor­row a phrase of­ten used about the pan­demic, Sin­ga­pore should not let the ex­pe­ri­ence go to waste.</p>
    <p>What is­sues have emerged in the pub­lic dis­cus­sion, on­line and in main­stream me­dia, so far?</p>
    <p>First is the ques­tion of priv­i­lege and en­ti­tle­ment en­joyed by the rich and in­flu­en­tial, in­clud­ing their access to jus­tice and cor­ri­dors of power.</p>
    <p>It be­came a talking point af­ter the ap­peal judge, Jus­tice Chan Seng Onn, high­lighted a num­ber of dis­crep­an­cies in the po­lice in­ves­ti­ga­tion and sub­se­quent pros­e­cu­tion of the case by the At­tor­ney-Gen­eral’s Cham­bers, lead­ing Law and Home Af­fairs Min­is­ter K. Shan­mugam to say that some­thing had gone wrong in the chain of events.</p>
    <p>“We have to look at that, and deal with what went wrong,” he noted.</p>
    <p>Con­versely, it raises the ques­tion of whether the sys­tem is bi­ased against the poor and vul­ner­a­ble, in­clud­ing mi­grant work­ers, who have lit­tle means to prove their in­no­cence, es­pe­cially when they are up against the high and mighty.</p>
    <p>The Gov­ern­ment has to deal with th­ese is­sues openly and forthright­ly – not just to ap­pease pub­lic outrage but also be­cause they strike at the heart of what makes Sin­ga­pore what it is, which has to do with the in­tegrity and ef­fec­tive­ness of its pub­lic in­sti­tu­tions.</p>
    <p>Peo­ple can ac­cept huge dif­fer­ences in wealth, say, be­tween a busi­ness ty­coon and his ser­vant. That is the re­al­ity of a cap­i­tal­ist so­ci­ety like Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>But they will re­volt if, on top of this wealth gap, there is a priv­i­lege and en­ti­tle­ment di­vide that sep­a­rates the elites from the masses.</p>
    <p>It is the rea­son why there is such widespread anger against elite power in some coun­tries in the West, cre­at­ing growing dis­trust of the gov­ern­ment.</p>
    <p>Hence, the Gov­ern­ment should make sure that its re­view of the case is as ob­jec­tive and thor­ough as pos­si­ble, and more im­por­tant, be seen to be so.</p>
    <p>When Par­lia­ment de­bates the mat­ter next month, as it is likely to fol­low­ing Mr Shan­mugam’s min­is­te­rial state­ment and the mo­tion the Work­ers’ Party in­tends to in­tro­duce, I hope there will be a thor­ough air­ing of not just the is­sues raised in Jus­tice Chan’s judg­ment but also this broader ques­tion: How to pro­tect the Sin­ga­pore sys­tem from be­ing abused by peo­ple with po­si­tion and wealth, whether de­lib­er­ately or as a re­sult of in­sti­tu­tional or cul­tural bias?</p>
    <p>In rais­ing this, I am not sug­gest­ing that Mr Liew is guilty of us­ing his po­si­tion to in­flu­ence the var­i­ous agen­cies to pur­sue the pros­e­cu­tion of Ms Parti.</p>
    <p>There has been no ev­i­dence of this and he should be pre­sumed in­no­cent un­til proven guilty, even though he and his fam­ily may have com­mit­ted other trans­gres­sions, as high­lighted by Jus­tice Chan.</p>
    <p>What­ever the find­ings of the Gov­ern­ment’s re­view, this is an op­por­tu­nity to de­bate whether more can be done to pro­tect pub­lic agen­cies and their of­fi­cers from un­due in­flu­ence or in­sti­tu­tional bias, and to do more to en­sure every­one is treated equally, es­pe­cially the poor and vul­ner­a­ble.</p>
    <p>In fact, it is even more im­por­tant to have this dis­cus­sion today be­cause gov­ern­ment-linked com­pa­nies are an even larger part of the econ­omy today than in 1996, with more civil ser­vants and for­mer of­fi­cers run­ning th­ese busi­nesses or sit­ting on their boards.</p>
    <p>Peo­ple at the top, whether in Gov­ern­ment or busi­ness, have more con­nec­tions with one an­other, move in the same so­cial cir­cles and can eas­ily open doors for one an­other.</p>
    <p>Some of this is in­evitable and im­pos­si­ble to avoid. But the prob­lem is pre­cisely that a bit of it here and there can slowly but surely lead to an en­ti­tle­ment cul­ture if unchecked.</p>
    <p>The Ja­panese have a word for this called son­taku – the pre-emp­tive</p>
    <p>fol­low­ing of an or­der that has not been given, a nod-and-wink un­der­stand­ing of what needs to be done among those in an in­ner cir­cle.</p>
    <p>There have been a num­ber of po­lit­i­cal scan­dals aris­ing out of this, in­clud­ing a re­cent one in­volv­ing for­mer premier Shinzo Abe in which land sold to a school with links to him and his wife was trans­acted at a much re­duced price.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore has to guard against this as much as it did against cor­rup­tion.</p>
    <p>The ef­fort has to be re­lent­less be­cause even if only a hand­ful at the top is cor­rupt, those be­low will be­gin to won­der why they can­not also get a share, and soon every­one will want his en­ti­tle­ment.</p>
    <p>In a mer­i­to­cratic sys­tem like Sin­ga­pore which re­wards suc­cess­ful peo­ple am­ply, the task of mak­ing sure that the re­sul­tant in­come di­vide does not lead to so­cial and po­lit­i­cal prob­lems falls not only on the Gov­ern­ment but also on those who have made it.</p>
    <p>To be fair, many have done so by con­tribut­ing in var­i­ous ways, in­clud­ing phi­lan­thropy and in vol­un­teer­ing their services for the com­mu­nity.</p>
    <p>What is im­por­tant is a mind­set and at­ti­tude that ev­ery per­son mat­ters equally and all have much to con­trib­ute, though in dif­fer­ent ways.</p>
    <p>It is when any group feels it is su­pe­rior and has a spe­cial place that prob­lems oc­cur.</p>
    <p>Found­ing prime min­is­ter Lee Kuan Yew recog­nised this prob­lem way back in 1967 when he spoke to grass­roots lead­ers, many of whom were busi­ness­men. He was as usual blunt and force­ful but his words are as rel­e­vant today, more than 50 years later, and you should read them in full: “If you re­ally sit down and think, you will know why you must have time and feel­ing for the peo­ple who are not so suc­cess­ful.</p>
    <p>“Then, they will leave you in charge to make the de­ci­sions, to make their lives bet­ter. But if they think they are leav­ing you in charge and you are mak­ing de­ci­sions to make your life bet­ter at their ex­pense, then there will be trou­ble.</p>
    <p>“If you act like a big shot, not only will you col­lapse but you will also bring the Gov­ern­ment down. There­fore, when any­body acts like a big shot, my job is to take the pin and poke the bal­loon and break it.”</p>
    <p>The pub­lic out­cry over Ms Parti’s case shows that Sin­ga­pore­ans ex­pect the Gov­ern­ment to be still hold­ing that pin.</p>
