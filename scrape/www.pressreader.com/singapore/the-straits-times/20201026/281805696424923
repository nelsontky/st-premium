    <p>Last month, soft­ware en­gi­neer Nabendu Biswas moved out of In­dia’s tech cap­i­tal, Ben­galuru, and re­turned to his home town, Bhopal, which is among the clean­est cities in the coun­try.</p>
    <p>He took his seven-year-old son out of school and his wife quit her teach­ing job for the move at the peak of the Covid-19 pan­demic in the coun­try.</p>
    <p>“My job (right now) re­quires work­ing re­motely. So I de­cided to move back to my home town. Now even if I have to go back to the of­fice, my wife and kid will stay here. I re­alised the child was de­vel­op­ing breath­ing prob­lems be­cause of the pol­lu­tion,” he said.</p>
    <p>The Covid-19 sit­u­a­tion, he added, led to deep in­tro­spec­tion, about where he wanted his child to grow up and how he wanted to save money.</p>
    <p>“The cost of liv­ing (in Ben­galuru) is so high. And I used to spend six hours trav­el­ling. Three hours each way. I don’t think any­where in the world any­one spends three hours com­mut­ing one way.”</p>
    <p>As work from home is an op­tion now, many pro­fes­sion­als have moved out of the big cities, for­go­ing the high rents and other liv­ing costs for a rel­a­tively cheaper and sim­ple life back home. Some are mov­ing tem­po­rar­ily, oth­ers for longer.</p>
    <p>In March, In­dia in­sti­tuted one of the most strin­gent l ock­downs which shut down the economy.</p>
    <p>It im­me­di­ately trig­gered a re­verse mi­gra­tion of hun­dreds of thou­sands of mi­grant l abour­ers who had lost their jobs and were des­per­ately seek­ing to reach home, many of them walk­ing.</p>
    <p>While the re­turn of mi­grants and the hard­ships caused by the sud­den lock­down i n March has been widely doc­u­mented, the move­ment of pro­fes­sion­als has not re­ceived as much at­ten­tion, prob­a­bly be­cause it has so far not been on the scale of the poorer work­ers.</p>
    <p>“How much of it (pro­fes­sion­als mov­ing out of cities) will hap­pen we don’t know. High-skilled mi­gra­tion (for those with the op­tion of work­ing from home) is ba­si­cally for them to save money,” said Pro­fes­sor S. Iru­daya Ra­jan at the Cen­tre for De­vel­op­ment Stud­ies, an au­ton­o­mous re­search cen­tre.</p>
    <p>“This is some­thing that is hap­pen­ing glob­ally, not just in Chen­nai, Mum­bai or Ben­galuru. It is lead­ing to huge sav­ings and a lot of in­vest­ment will hap­pen in vil­lages and towns.”</p>
    <p>A study by Anarock Prop­erty Con­sul­tants said In­dia’s top cities ac­count for al­most 70 per cent of the coun­try’s res­i­den­tial mar­ket, with the next rung of smaller cities ac­count­ing for the re­main­der. This ra­tio, the study said, could change with cities like Coim­bat­ore, Jaipur and Ahmedabad be­ing the main ben­e­fi­cia­ries of the re­verse mi­gra­tion of pro­fes­sion­als.</p>
    <p>“The work-from-home cul­ture has set­tled in, with many com­pa­nies now al­low­ing pro­tracted or even per­ma­nent WFH op­tions for their em­ploy­ees. This has kick­started a move­ment to­wards the less clut­tered and cheaper sub­urbs, or even a sort of re­verse mi­gra­tion wherein many peo­ple choose to move to smaller cities, of­ten their home towns, as prop­er­ties are cheaper there,” said Anarock chair­man Anuj Puri.</p>
    <p>“This en­ables them to buy larger homes with home of­fices. Smaller cities are also con­sid­ered safer than the met­ros from a pan­demic point of view.”</p>
    <p>But pro­fes­sion­als have also been the vic­tim of job cuts. The Cen­tre for Mon­i­tor­ing In­dian Economy, a business in­for­ma­tion com­pany, has said that 6.6 mil­lion white-col­lar work­ers lost their jobs between May and Au­gust.</p>
    <p>Among them is Mr Chintham Venu, who lost his job as a field in­ves­ti­ga­tor for a gov­ern­ment sta­tis­ti­cal of­fice in Waran­gal in Te­lan­gana state. He re­turned to his home vil­lage in a nearby district some 30km away, where his fa­ther is a farmer, and is now plan­ning a trip next month to Hy­der­abad, the state cap­i­tal, to look for a job. “Right now, I am sit­ting at home. I don’t know if I will get a job,” he said.</p>
    <p>Some are also dis­cov­er­ing that re­turn­ing to their home towns is a good way to recharge.</p>
    <p>In March, Ms Smita Sun­darara­man wound up the natur­opa­thy clinic she had op­er­ated for eight years in the city of Gur­gaon. By mid-Au­gust, she was back in Luc­know in Ut­tar Pradesh state.</p>
    <p>“I knew it (Covid-19) was go­ing to hurt the business. We do phys­i­cal treat­ments in our cen­tre and can’t do it 3m apart. Peo­ple were para­noid and there was so much un­cer­tainty in the en­vi­ron­ment. It was a dif­fi­cult call (to shut down the business and re­turn to her home town),” she said.</p>
    <p>Ms Sun­darara­man, who also took her two chil­dren out of school, is now re­assess­ing the fam­ily’s fu­ture as she ad­justs to life just 15 min­utes away from her mother in her home town.</p>
    <p>“This is a good time for in­tro­spec­tion,” she said.</p>
    <p>But she can­not marvel enough at the help she is get­ting, even from neigh­bours. Her next-door neigh­bour is walk­ing her two dogs ev­ery morn­ing af­ter she frac­tured her foot.</p>
    <p>“Who does that any­where else?” said Ms Sun­darara­man, ob­vi­ously re­fer­ring to the city where she lived pre­vi­ously.</p>
