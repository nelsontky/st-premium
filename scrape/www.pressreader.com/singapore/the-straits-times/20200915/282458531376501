    <p>•</p>
    <p>MONTEVIDEO Uruguayan foot­baller Edinson Cavani has swopped foot­ball boots for bal­let shoes to help pop­u­larise clas­si­cal dance for boys and smash stereo­types in his na­tive coun­try.</p>
    <p>As the foot­ball world spec­u­lates on the 33-year-old’s fu­ture, Cavani donned tights at the Uruguay Na­tional Bal­let school in Montevideo re­cently to lend him­self to ef­forts to get young boys in soc­cer­mad Uruguay to take up bal­let.</p>
    <p>“I don’t share the view that ev­ery boy has to play only soccer,” the long-haired striker said.</p>
    <p>“I be­lieve that girls and boys have to be free to seek their hap­pi­ness in what they are most pas­sion­ate about, be­cause that’s the best way to be well-trained, grow­ing day by day in a firm struc­ture,” added Cavani.</p>
    <p>Paris Saint-Ger­main’s all-time record scorer has ended his con­tract with the French cham­pi­ons and is a free agent, with clubs lsuch as Italy’s Ju­ven­tus and Spain’s Atletico Madrid cir­cling for his sig­na­ture.</p>
    <p>Be­fore head­ing back to Europe to find a new club, Cavani ac­cepted an in­vi­ta­tion from the Na­tional School for Artis­tic Train­ing (Enfa) to take part in a campaign to in­crease the re­cruit­ment of young boys in Uruguay’s na­tional bal­let school.</p>
    <p>Trad­ing his body-swerves and step-overs for pirou­ettes and “glis­sades”, Cavani was put through his paces by pro­fes­sional dancers at the So­dre, Uruguay’s Na­tional Bal­let com­pany, be­fore record­ing a video mes­sage to kids.</p>
    <p>“The ex­pe­ri­ence was in­cred­i­ble, the dancers ex­plained to me how to do the steps and when I saw them, I was left with a real sense of ad­mi­ra­tion. Be­cause dance is some­thing won­der­ful,” he said.</p>
    <p>The Uruguayan striker said the link with bal­let came via his wife Jo­ce­lyn Bur­gardt, who has a de­gree in cul­tural man­age­ment.</p>
    <p>“My life part­ner is pas­sion­ate about dance. That’s why when we were in Paris, we went to see the bal­let where we had a great time and re­ally en­joyed it, ” he said.</p>
    <p>Uruguay, one of the smaller na­tions in the world of foot­ball, has al­ways punched above its weight on the soccer stage, twice win­ning the World Cup in 1930 and 1950.</p>
    <p>In large part, it is down to what they call “Garra Char­rua” – a fight­ing spirit rooted in the cul­ture of the coun­try’s last indige­nous peo­ple, the Char­ruas, and the silky skill of</p>
    <p>I don’t share the view that ev­ery boy has to play only soccer. I be­lieve that girls and boys have to be free to seek their hap­pi­ness in what they are most pas­sion­ate about, be­cause that’s the best way to be well-trained, grow­ing day by day in a firm struc­ture.</p>
    <p>play­ers such as Cavani.</p>
    <p>But Cavani’s mes­sage is that Uruguay’s young men should not be afraid to em­brace their grace­ful side too.</p>
    <p>Of the 440 stu­dents at­tend­ing Enfa’s classes in bal­let, con­tem­po­rary dance, tango, folk­lore and lyri­cal art, less than a quar­ter are boys. And the pro­por­tion drops dras­ti­cally in dance: 148 girls to 12 boys, dur­ing a pe­riod when the So­dre has emerged as one of the most pres­ti­gious bal­let com­pa­nies in Latin Amer­ica.</p>
    <p>“The gen­der gap is not nar­row­ing, not even in tango. And it hasn’t changed in re­cent years,” said Ms</p>
    <p>Natalia So­br­era, ex­ec­u­tive di­rec­tor of Enfa.</p>
    <p>She said that when boys do en­rol, many drop out of classes early be­cause of a lack of fam­ily sup­port.</p>
    <p>“Then there’s all the peer pres­sure. There are a lot of boys who hide their bal­let shoes in their back­packs – some­times even from their fa­thers, be­cause they don’t like them com­ing,” said Ms So­br­era.</p>
    <p>So the campaign fronted by Cavani is aimed at fam­i­lies, as much as boys them­selves.</p>
    <p>For the boys, there are no prej­u­dices, “it’s a phys­i­cal ex­pe­ri­ence, where you acquire habits of move­ment, like in soccer”, said Ms So­br­era.</p>
    <p>With adults, how­ever, there is work to do to rid them of pre­con­ceived no­tions about dance and gen­der, she said.</p>
    <p>“Dance has noth­ing to do with the ques­tion of mas­culin­ity, ” Ms So­br­era added.</p>
