    <p>Amid a Covid-19 pan­demic that has dis­rupted learn­ing, stu­dents from Sin­ga­pore who sat the In­ter­na­tional Bac­calau­re­ate (IB) di­ploma ex­ams last Novem­ber have man­aged to out­shine their global coun­ter­parts again.</p>
    <p>The Switzer­land-based IB Or­gan­i­sa­tion, which con­ducts the ex­ams, said Sin­ga­pore pro­duced 55 of the 99 per­fect scor­ers – more than half – this year.</p>
    <p>Of the 2,228 stu­dents in Sin­ga­pore who took the ex­ams, 97.73 per cent passed. The global pass rate was 76.68 per cent, while the rate for the Asia-Pa­cific re­gion was 91.83 per cent.</p>
    <p>The av­er­age scores of Sin­ga­pore stu­dents were also higher than those of their global and re­gional coun­ter­parts: 38.35 points against 29.81 and 34.83 re­spec­tively.</p>
    <p>More than half – 50.65 per cent – of Sin­ga­pore stu­dents also scored 40 points and above, out of 45. In com­par­i­son, 11.63 per cent of global stu­dents and 27.66 per cent of Asia-Pa­cific stu­dents achieved the same re­sult.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, stu­dents from eight schools – in­clud­ing An­glo-Chi­nese School (In­de­pen­dent), School of the Arts (Sota) and St Joseph’s In­sti­tu­tion (SJI) – re­ceived their re­sults.</p>
    <p>All 443 stu­dents in ACS(I) – the first Sin­ga­pore school to of­fer the IB di­ploma since it was ac­cred­ited in 2005 – passed the IB exam. Their av­er­age score was 41.8 points, with 363 of them ob­tain­ing 40 points and above.</p>
    <p>At Hwa Chong In­ter­na­tional School, 99.3 per cent of its 144-strong co­hort passed the exam, with an av­er­age score of 37. Six stu­dents ob­tained 44 points.</p>
    <p>SJI said 99.3 per cent of its 272 stu­dents in the di­ploma pro­gramme passed, with an av­er­age score of 40.3. There were 184 stu­dents who at­tained at least 40 points.</p>
    <p>SJI In­ter­na­tional saw all 183 grad­u­ates in the co­hort pass, with an av­er­age of 37.7 points.</p>
    <p>Re­li­gious school Madrasah Alju­nied Al-Is­lamiah’s first batch of 25 stu­dents in the di­ploma pro­gramme passed the ex­ams as well. The school’s av­er­age score was 34.8 points.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, at Sota, all 157 stu­dents in the co­hort passed too. Those in the di­ploma pro­gramme ob­tained an av­er­age score of 38.7 points.</p>
    <p>Sota vis­ual arts stu­dent Izz Muham­mad Ah­mad said that the cir­cuit breaker pe­riod ear­lier this year due to the pan­demic gave him more time to com­plete his as­sess­ments at home.</p>
    <p>While this also meant there was less time for lessons, the 18-yearold took the ini­tia­tive in ar­rang­ing con­sul­ta­tions and ask­ing his peers for help.</p>
    <p>“Ev­ery sit­u­a­tion has mul­ti­ple per­spec­tives to it. There may be good and bad as­pects of it, and we should look for the good ones and fig­ure out a way to lessen the bad ones.”</p>
    <p>The IB Or­gan­i­sa­tion noted that due to pro­longed Covid-19 un­cer­tain­ties, schools had been pro­vided with a choice of op­tions for their stu­dents, in­clud­ing award­ing grades us­ing writ­ten ex­am­i­na­tions if they could be sat safely and an al­ter­na­tive route us­ing course­work and pre­dicted grades.</p>
    <p>Schools could also con­sider de­fer­ring to the May 2021 ses­sion with no ad­di­tional cost or with­draw­ing from the IB Novem­ber ses­sion with a full re­fund.</p>
    <p>The or­gan­i­sa­tion said that 73 per cent of the IB world schools were able to ad­min­is­ter the ex­ams us­ing lo­cal guide­lines for safe exam ad­min­is­tra­tion.</p>
    <p>The re­main­ing 27 per cent had not been able to ad­min­is­ter the ex­ams as a re­sult of gov­ern­men­tal man­date or lo­cal con­di­tions.</p>
    <p>The IB Di­ploma Pro­gramme is a two-year pro­gramme con­ducted at 27 in­sti­tu­tions in to­tal in Sin­ga­pore. IB qual­i­fi­ca­tions are recog­nised by uni­ver­si­ties across the globe.</p>
