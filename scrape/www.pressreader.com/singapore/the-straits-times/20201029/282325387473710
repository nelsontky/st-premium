    <p>For 50 years, no woman had won the Coach of the Year gong at the Sin­ga­pore Sports Awards. Last night, for­mer women’s na­tional floor­ball coach Louise Khng made history by be­com­ing the first to win the pres­ti­gious accolade.</p>
    <p>She beat five men – Gao Ning (ta­ble ten­nis), Mu­lyo Han­doyo (bad­minton), Kir­ill Ivanov (shoot­ing), Stephan Wid­mer (swimming), Ja­son Yeong-Nathan (bowl­ing) – to the tro­phy.</p>
    <p>On her mile­stone win, Khng, 37, said: “It re­ally opens up the field for fe­male coaches out there to strive to be re­ally good coaches, to be there for their ath­letes, and to know that no mat­ter what they do, they will be recog­nised even­tu­ally.”</p>
    <p>Un­der her guid­ance, the floor­ball women placed 12th at the 2019 World Floor­ball Cham­pi­onship in Neucha­tel, Switzer­land, in De­cem­ber last year. It is the team’s best per­for­mance at the world meet.</p>
    <p>Cur­rently ranked world No. 14, the women’s team were also re­warded for a stel­lar sea­son last year when they were named Team of the Year for the sec­ond time, ahead of the only other nom­i­nee, the men’s na­tional soft­ball team.</p>
    <p>The floor­ballers also re­tained their SEA Games gold medal at the 2019 edi­tion in the Philip­pines.</p>
    <p>When asked what was the key to her team’s progress, Khng, who stepped down in Jan­uary, said: “I think it’s heart work.</p>
    <p>“We all fo­cus on the hard work every­body puts in, but it’s re­ally about the heart that ev­ery­one has to achieve what they want to and reach their max­i­mum po­ten­tial.</p>
    <p>“I don’t think (heart work) is a le­git word, but for us that’s it – all the sac­ri­fices and com­mit­ment ev­ery­one has done over the years.”</p>
    <p>For­mer co-cap­tain Deb­bie Poh, who called time on her ca­reer af­ter the world meet, called the award an “ex­tra high” for her af­ter the team’s land­mark per­for­mance.</p>
    <p>She said she hoped the award would pro­vide im­pe­tus for the women’s team as they pre­pare for three ma­jor tour­na­ments in 2021 – the Asian In­door Games in Thai­land in May, qual­i­fiers for the World Cham­pi­onships in Ja­pan in June, and the world tour­na­ment if they earn a berth, in Swe­den in De­cem­ber. She added: “I just hope the cur­rent ladies just con­tinue to work hard for the na­tion and for them­selves, re­gard­less of the re­sult.”</p>
