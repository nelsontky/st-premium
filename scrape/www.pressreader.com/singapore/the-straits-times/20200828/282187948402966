    <p>It is heart­en­ing to note that Sin­ga­pore is striv­ing to be an in­clu­sive so­ci­ety in ar­eas of ed­u­ca­tion and jobs, and by keep­ing learn­ing and work op­por­tu­ni­ties open to all.</p>
    <p>With the in­crease in aware­ness of spe­cial needs, more chil­dren are for­mally as­sessed with be­havioural con­di­tions such as at­ten­tion deficit hy­per­ac­tive dis­or­der (ADHD).</p>
    <p>While th­ese chil­dren may ex­pe­ri­ence a more ar­du­ous jour­ney in school, they may sub­se­quently opt for non-desk-bound jobs and man­age their con­di­tion with­out their col­leagues even know­ing.</p>
    <p>I am a par­ent of a teenage child with ADHD. To en­cour­age him, I have cited fa­mous per­son­al­i­ties who have over­come their con­di­tion and done well in life such as swim­mer Michael Phelps.</p>
    <p>Sadly, as I re­cently re­searched his op­tions in the in­sti­tutes of higher learn­ing (IHLs) and jobs in the area of sports or the out­door and ad­ven­ture cat­e­gory, I note that one IHL and one em­ployer re­quire the ap­pli­cant to de­clare that he does not have ADHD, among other med­i­cal con­di­tions or spe­cial needs.</p>
    <p>While I can un­der­stand that such pre­req­ui­sites are mostly put in place with the ap­pli­cant’s safety in mind and there is men­tion of fur­ther as­sess­ment of suit­abil­ity, I feel such ex­clu­sions should be re­viewed care­fully and listed only if it is ab­so­lutely crit­i­cal (life or death).</p>
    <p>I also feel that ma­ture work­ing adults should not need to de­clare be­havioural con­di­tions such as ADHD in their job ap­pli­ca­tions, as they are ma­ture enough to man­age their con­di­tion and it is their work­ing at­ti­tude that re­ally mat­ters.</p>
    <p>I hope the Gov­ern­ment will con­tinue en­cour­ag­ing IHLs and em­ploy­ers to eval­u­ate suit­abil­ity and ca­pa­bil­i­ties based on an in­di­vid­ual’s pas­sion and ap­ti­tude, so that we can work to­wards be­ing a truly in­clu­sive so­ci­ety.</p>
