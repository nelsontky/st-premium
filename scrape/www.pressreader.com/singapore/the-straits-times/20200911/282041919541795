    <p>ANX­IOUS FOR NEW NTUC CARD</p>
    <p>I am 88 years old with no IT knowl­edge, no PC or printer.</p>
    <p>My NTUC mem­ber­ship card ex­pired in April this year and I was asked to re­new the mem­ber­ship on June 17.</p>
    <p>I sent a cheque on June 23 and since then I have not re­ceived any ac­knowl­edge­ment or card.</p>
    <p>How can I get a new card? I have been a mem­ber since my work­ing days. I am sure there are other el­derly peo­ple in a sim­i­lar sit­u­a­tion.</p>
    <p>STEP UP SIZE OF MICE EVENTS</p>
    <p>Rais­ing the limit of del­e­gates al­lowed for meet­ings, in­cen­tives, con­ven­tions and ex­hi­bi­tions (Mice) events from 50 to 250 del­e­gates is too timid and con­ser­va­tive a move (S’pore to al­low big­ger Mice events with up to 250 peo­ple, Sept 8).</p>
    <p>The fa­tal­ity rate from Covid-19 in Singapore is low and our hos­pi­tals are cop­ing well.</p>
    <p>There are fewer curbs on busi­ness events in places cop­ing well with the pan­demic – for ex­am­ple, Malaysia, Ger­many, China and Tai­wan. I would as­sume Singapore is in a sim­i­lar po­si­tion and should fol­low the lead of Ger­many, which will lift the limit on at­ten­dees of busi­ness events to 1,000 peo­ple next month.</p>

    <p>SPEED­ING IN CARPARKS</p>
    <p>How is the speed limit within HDB and URA carparks mon­i­tored and en­forced? I can hardly find any sig­nage at carpark en­trances or within to in­form all mo­torists the max­i­mum speed limit al­lowed.</p>
    <p>Many times, I have wit­nessed mo­torists and mo­tor­cy­clists trav­el­ling far above the speed limit in carparks.</p>
    <p>Could the rel­e­vant au­thor­i­ties look into this be­fore ac­ci­dents hap­pen?</p>

    <p>PROUD OF TUAS FA­CIL­ITY</p>
    <p>The Tuas Nexus fa­cil­ity is a world-class project that will make Singapore stand out as one of the lead­ers in ad­vanc­ing en­vi­ron­men­tal sus­tain­abil­ity.</p>
    <p>It is an in­valu­able con­tri­bu­tion to the fight against cli­mate change. Just as Ne­wa­ter made an im­pact years ago in the chal­lenge to meet our wa­ter needs, I be­lieve this project will also do us proud when it is fully com­pleted in 2025.</p>

    <p>TELCO’S SE­NIORS’ OF­FER DIS­AP­POINTS</p>
    <p>The lat­est pro­mo­tional of­fer by new telco TPG as part of the Se­nior Goes Dig­i­tal move­ment is in­deed a very af­ford­able one, and my wife and I promptly sub­scribed to it. We picked up the two SIM cards only to find that they did not work de­spite be­ing told the mo­bile lines would be ac­ti­vated im­me­di­ately.</p>
    <p>There is no helpline to call and we had to e-mail or get on Face­book to lodge a com­plaint. On Face­book, I was shocked to read the nu­mer­ous com­ments on the telco’s poor ser­vice. I hope the au­thor­i­ties will re­view this new telco and au­dit its ser­vices.</p>
