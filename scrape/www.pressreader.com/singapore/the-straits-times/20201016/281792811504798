    <p>LONDON • Lon­don­ers will be banned from mix­ing with other house­holds in­doors and Paris is set for a cur­few, as Euro­pean lead­ers strug­gle to cope with a record num­ber of new Covid-19 cases around the re­gion.</p>
    <p>Bri­tish Prime Min­is­ter Boris John­son has man­dated tighter re­stric­tions in London, while French Pres­i­dent Em­manuel Macron will con­fine res­i­dents of nine of the coun­try’s big­gest cities to their homes be­tween 9pm and 6am for four weeks from to­mor­row. Ger­man Chan­cel­lor Angela Merkel im­plored cit­i­zens to abide by dis­tanc­ing rules and avoid groups.</p>
    <p>The var­ied ap­proaches to the disease around Europe have caused con­fu­sion and stoked un­rest among the pan­demic-weary pub­lic.</p>
    <p>As death rates keep ris­ing, lead­ers have lit­tle re­course but to tell peo­ple to knuckle down.</p>
    <p>Mr John­son was adamant he did not want a sec­ond lock­down, but now the prospect of a so-called “cir­cuit breaker” with schools closed for two weeks is in the air.</p>
    <p>From mid­night, mil­lions of res­i­dents in London will come un­der new re­stric­tions dis­al­low­ing them from so­cial­is­ing with other house­holds be­hind closed doors, in­clud­ing in pubs and restau­rants.</p>
    <p>“I know these re­stric­tions are dif­fi­cult for peo­ple, I hate that we have to bring them in, but it is es­sen­tial that we do bring them in both to keep peo­ple safe and to pre­vent greater eco­nomic dam­age in the fu­ture,” Health Sec­re­tary Matt Han­cock told Par­lia­ment yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Out­side London, of­fi­cials are try­ing to tame the virus with a re­gional “whack-a-mole” strat­egy that has cre­ated ten­sions with the poorer north where the num­ber of cases is ris­ing rapidly.</p>
    <p>The gov­ern­ment has ear­marked Manch­ester for the tough­est re­stric­tions, but is stuck in talks with lo­cal lead­ers over fi­nan­cial sup­port. There is also dis­par­ity within Bri­tain it­self on the best ap­proach.</p>
    <p>North­ern Ire­land plans to close schools from Mon­day and im­pose curbs on pubs and restau­rants, and Wales wants to re­strict travel from English hot spots, with new rules com­ing into force to­day.</p>
    <p>The lat­est de­vel­op­ments come as Ger­many, Italy, Aus­tria and the Czech Repub­lic all re­ported record in­creases in cases, and London ap­proached an av­er­age of 100 in­fec­tions per 100,000 peo­ple.</p>
    <p>The Euro­pean au­thor­i­ties are grap­pling with how to de­vise tar­geted strate­gies to slow the spread of the disease with­out re­sort­ing to the kind of broad na­tional lock­downs that dec­i­mated eco­nomic ac­tiv­ity ear­lier this year.</p>
    <p>Dr Merkel strug­gled to forge a con­sen­sus with re­gional Ger­man lead­ers in a meet­ing that dragged on for more than eight hours into Wed­nes­day night.</p>
    <p>Chan­cellery Min­is­ter Helge</p>
    <p>GER­MANY 7,173 Num­ber of new cases in the 24 hours un­til yes­ter­day morn­ing.</p>
    <p>Braun said mea­sures agreed for hard-hit ar­eas – in­clud­ing clos­ing bars and restau­rants at 11pm and ex­tend­ing manda­tory mask-wear­ing – were un­likely to tame the “enor­mous in­fec­tion dy­namic”.</p>
    <p>“There can be ab­so­lutely no ques­tion that this is the start of a very broad sec­ond wave,” Prof Braun, a qual­i­fied med­i­cal doc­tor, told ARD tele­vi­sion yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Ger­many recorded 7,173 new cases in the 24 hours un­til yes­ter­day morn­ing, ex­ceed­ing a high dur­ing the pre­vi­ous peak of the pan­demic in late March.</p>
    <p>“Eco­nom­i­cally, we can’t af­ford a sec­ond wave with the same con­se­quences as we had in the spring,” Dr Merkel said. “What we do and don’t do in the com­ing days and weeks will be key to the ques­tion of how we make it through this pan­demic.”</p>
    <p>Euro­pean in­fec­tions be­gan a resur­gence in the late sum­mer, fu­elled by re­turn­ing trav­ellers and young par­ty­go­ers. Lo­cal fam­ily, work and so­cial gath­er­ings have since spurred fur­ther con­ta­gion.</p>
    <p>The re­gion as a whole recorded al­most 700,000 new cases last week, the most since the pan­demic be­gan, and tak­ing the to­tal to just be­low seven mil­lion, ac­cord­ing to the World Health Or­gan­i­sa­tion. Bri­tain, France, Rus­sia and Spain ac­counted for more than half of all new cases.</p>
    <p>In France, daily cases have jumped to more than 22,000 from less than 12,000 a week ago, and more than 40 per cent of in­ten­sive­care beds in the Paris re­gion are taken by Covid-19 pa­tients.</p>
    <p>Prime Min­is­ter Jean Cas­tex and other min­is­ters were due to pro­vide de­tails on the new mea­sures yes­ter­day. Mr Macron on Wed­nes­day said the sit­u­a­tion in hospi­tals was un­sus­tain­able and that the goal was to bring new cases down to 3,000 to 4,000 a day. “We are learn­ing how to be a nation again,” he said. “We had be­come used to be­ing in­di­vid­u­als. But we are a united nation, and we will suc­ceed.”</p>
    <p>Ital­ian Prime Min­is­ter Giuseppe Conte warned that the nation will “be in trouble again” if the ris­ing trend per­sists and for the first time de­clined to rule out a new na­tion­wide lock­down. The coun­try re­ported a record 7,322 new in­fec­tions on Wed­nes­day.</p>
    <p>“I’m not mak­ing any pre­dic­tions,” Mr Conte said when asked about a vi­rol­o­gist’s warn­ing that the coun­try could be un­der lock­down by Christ­mas. “A lot de­pends on how cit­i­zens be­have.”</p>
    <p>In Spain, For­eign Min­is­ter Aran­cha Gon­za­lez Laya pushed back against re­ports that the spread of the virus and the po­lit­i­cal tus­sling over how to con­tain it are spark­ing con­cerns in Ber­lin.</p>
    <p>The coun­try has regis­tered 300,000 new cases over the past month, bring­ing the num­ber of in­fec­tions to al­most a mil­lion. In an in­ter­view with Bloomberg Tele­vi­sion yes­ter­day, Mrs Gon­za­lez Laya in­sisted that the Span­ish out­break was “un­der con­trol”.</p>
    <p>FRANCE 22,591 Num­ber of new daily cases re­ported on Wed­nes­day.</p>
    <p>BRI­TAIN 19,724 Num­ber of new daily cases re­ported on Wed­nes­day.</p>
    <p>START OF RESUR­GENCE There can be ab­so­lutely no ques­tion that this is the start of a very broad sec­ond wave. GER­MAN CHAN­CELLERY MIN­IS­TER HELGE BRAUN, on the surge in cases.</p>
    <p>RUS­SIA 14,231 Num­ber of new daily cases re­ported on Wed­nes­day.</p>
