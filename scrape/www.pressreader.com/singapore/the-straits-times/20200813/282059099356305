    <p>Two Sin­ga­porean sib­lings con­spired to se­cure ten­ders for two com­pa­nies in China in ex­change for bribes amount­ing to about 11.3 mil­lion yuan (S$2.2 mil­lion).</p>
    <p>The ten­ders were awarded by tech­nol­ogy firm Sea­gate Tech­nol­ogy In­ter­na­tional, where Teo Chu Ha, also known as Henry Teo, now 71, worked as se­nior di­rec­tor of lo­gis­tics.</p>
    <p>Teo used his po­si­tion in the com­pany and also his po­si­tion as a mem­ber of the com­mit­tee award­ing the ten­ders to ob­tain con­fi­den­tial in­for­ma­tion be­long­ing to Sea­gate.</p>
    <p>His sis­ter, Judy Teo Suya Bik, now 68, then used the in­for­ma­tion to help Shang­hai Long-Dis­tance Trans­porta­tion (SLT) and Feili In­ter­na­tional Trans­port (FIT) get the ten­ders.</p>
    <p>Af­ter a trial, both sib­lings were con­victed yes­ter­day of 50 counts of en­gag­ing in a con­spir­acy for Judy Teo to re­ceive the bribes in ex­change for help­ing the com­pa­nies.</p>
    <p>The court also found them each guilty of one charge in­volv­ing Henry Teo’s trans­fer of $703,480 – which formed part of the bribes – from his sis­ter’s bank ac­count to his own ac­counts.</p>
    <p>Court doc­u­ments state that Sea­gate held a ten­der for truck­ing routes in China in 2006 and 2009. Both times, Henry Teo was in the com­mit­tee award­ing the ten­der.</p>
    <p>In their sub­mis­sions, Deputy Pub­lic Prose­cu­tors Navin Naidu and Ang Siok Chen said that Judy Teo used the con­fi­den­tial in­for­ma­tion pro­vided by her brother “as an ad­van­tage” to as­sist SLT and FIT in se­cur­ing the ten­ders.</p>
    <p>In ex­change, she was given a 10 per cent “com­mis­sion” of the rev­enue they earned based on pay­ments made by Sea­gate, they added.</p>
    <p>The “com­mis­sion” sums were paid to Judy Teo as “con­sul­tancy fees”, un­der a con­tract en­tered be­tween the two com­pa­nies in China and an­other com­pany, Twin Palms.</p>
    <p>The DPPs said that both sib­lings also used the bank ac­count of Judy Teo’s for­mer boyfriend Ong Eng Kiow to re­ceive the bribe amounts.</p>
    <p>As Judy Teo had con­trol over Mr Ong’s bank ac­count, she was able to with­draw the sums and de­posit them into her own bank ac­counts in China, they said.</p>
    <p>The DPPs also said that Judy Teo hatched a plan in July 2009 to pur­chase a prop­erty us­ing the bribes she re­ceived.</p>
    <p>She then en­tered into an ar­range­ment with Henry Teo, whereby the brother trans­ferred $703,480 from one of his sis­ter’s bank ac­counts into his per­sonal ac­counts be­tween July 2009 and Septem­ber 2010.</p>
    <p>The sum was even­tu­ally used to buy a prop­erty in Hume Av­enue in Sin­ga­pore un­der Judy Teo’s name.</p>
    <p>The sib­lings’ lawyers, Mr Ba­choo Mo­han Singh and Mr Too Xing Ji, had ar­gued that the “com­mis­sions” paid by SLT and FIT were for le­git­i­mate con­sul­tancy ser­vices ren­dered by Twin Palms.</p>
    <p>Dis­trict Judge Ng Cheng Thiam dis­agreed yes­ter­day, not­ing that Twin Palms should have drafted the con­tract be­tween the com­pa­nies if it were so.</p>
    <p>“In­stead, the con­tract was drafted by Henry and sent to Judy as early as Septem­ber 2006,” he said.</p>
    <p>They are ex­pected to be sen­tenced on Oct 19.</p>
