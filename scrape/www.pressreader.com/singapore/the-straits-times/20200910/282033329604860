    <p>Hous­ing Board (HDB) es­tates that do not have sig­nage in­di­cat­ing des­ig­nated en­try and exit points for emer­gency ve­hi­cles will soon get such signs.</p>
    <p>This fol­lows a fire at The Peak @ Toa Payoh last month, where a fire­fight­ing ve­hi­cle could not ac­cess the de­vel­op­ment as it had in­ad­ver­tently tried to en­ter the area via a des­ig­nated exit point.</p>
    <p>The exit point did not have suf­fi­cient turn­ing ra­dius and clear­ance for the ve­hi­cle to en­ter the es­tate, where an early morn­ing fire at Block 138C, Lorong 1A Toa Payoh on Aug 29 had led to some 300 peo­ple be­ing evac­u­ated and three taken to hos­pi­tal with burn in­juries and for smoke in­hala­tion.</p>
    <p>The es­tate does not have signs in­di­cat­ing emer­gency ve­hi­cle en­try and exit points, as it was built in 2012 be­fore the Fire Code man­dat­ing such sig­nage was up­dated in 2018. The new re­quire­ments were not ap­plied ret­ro­spec­tively.</p>
    <p>The Sin­ga­pore Civil De­fence Force (SCDF) yes­ter­day said the other 10 of its 11 ve­hi­cles de­ployed to The Peak had reached the scene with­out is­sue via the des­ig­nated emer­gency ve­hi­cle en­trance.</p>
    <p>It had been alerted to the fire at 2.55am that day. The fire in­volved con­tents in a unit on the 20th floor, and also af­fected a unit di­rectly above on the 21st floor.</p>
    <p>SCDF said it is work­ing with the HDB to put up sig­nage at The Peak and at other HDB de­vel­op­ments that sim­i­larly have such des­ig­nated en­try and exit points – re­quired un­der the 2007 Fire Code – but not the signs. The Straits Times has con­tacted HDB and SCDF for fur­ther com­ment.</p>
    <p>SCDF also said that its fire­fight­ers had been un­able to use a wet riser in Block 138C dur­ing the fire as it was not func­tion­ing, and it had on Fri­day or­dered Bis­han-Toa Payoh Town Coun­cil to rec­tify it.</p>
    <p>In re­sponse, the town coun­cil said yes­ter­day that fol­low­ing the fire on Aug 29, its fire pro­tec­tion con­trac­tor in­spected the wet riser sys­tem and found that it was “work­ing fine”.</p>
    <p>It added that the wet riser was last checked three days be­fore the fire, on Aug 26, and that its con­trac­tor’s re­port “showed that the wet riser sys­tem was in or­der”.</p>
    <p>The town coun­cil has en­gaged an en­gi­neer to in­ves­ti­gate why the wet riser “had no wa­ter” on Aug 29, and find­ings will be shared sub­se­quently.</p>
    <p>SCDF said it is also in­ves­ti­gat­ing the cause of the mal­func­tion and will “take fur­ther en­force­ment ac­tion against the re­spon­si­ble par­ties where nec­es­sary”.</p>
    <p>It also clar­i­fied that in­stead of us­ing the wet riser, the fires in both HDB units were “ef­fec­tively ex­tin­guished” us­ing hose reels, adding that “as a gen­eral prac­tice, SCDF si­mul­ta­ne­ously de­ploys the use of hose reels and wa­ter jets (con­nected to wet ris­ers) in fire­fight­ing op­er­a­tions”.</p>
    <p>Last Novem­ber, the JurongCle­menti Town Coun­cil was also is­sued a warn­ing by SCDF af­ter its of­fi­cers were un­able to use the hose reels when a fire broke out at a block in Bukit Ba­tok.</p>
    <p>SCDF of­fi­cers found a few hose reel cabi­nets in the block locked with pad­locks when they ar­rived at the scene on Nov 1.</p>
    <p>Af­ter break­ing one of the pad­locks, they dis­cov­ered that there was no wa­ter sup­ply for the hose reel in­side the cabi­net. The fire was ex­tin­guished us­ing wa­ter from SCDF’s emer­gency ve­hi­cles.</p>
