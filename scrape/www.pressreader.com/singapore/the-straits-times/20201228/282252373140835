    <p>One of Scorpio Elec­tric’s for­mer co-founders has started a ven­ture which makes elec­tric scoot­ers for the masses.</p>
    <p>Mr Joel Chang, chief op­er­at­ing of­fi­cer of Ion Mo­bil­ity, told The Straits Times he left Scorpio be­cause he felt tar­get­ing an elec­tric two-wheeler at the masses would be a more ef­fi­cient way of ad­dress­ing air pol­lu­tion – a key mis­sion of the start-up.</p>
    <p>Mr Chang, 43, part­nered ven­ture cap­i­tal­ist James Chan, 39, to start Ion last year. “Although we have only been op­er­a­tional for 14 months, we have as­sem­bled a sea­soned re­gional team,” Mr Chang said, adding that pro­duc­tion is slated to start in the fourth quar­ter of 2021 at an assem­bly fa­cil­ity in Ayer Ra­jah Cres­cent.</p>
    <p>Mr Chang said the re­tail price of the Ion 1 scooter is “not yet fi­nalised” but will be bench­marked against “pop­u­lar 150-155cc petrol bikes in In­done­sia and Sin­ga­pore”.</p>
    <p>The com­pany’s first mar­ket is In­done­sia, which ac­counts for close to 60 per cent of the 185 mil­lion or so mo­tor­cy­cles in South­east Asia.</p>
    <p>He added that the Ion 1 will be made ac­ces­si­ble to buy­ers in South-east Asia via “a range of sub­scrip­tion and own­er­ship plans”.</p>
    <p>“At the end of the day, we ex­pect the Ion 1 to outdo its petrol­guz­zling peers in terms of user ex­pe­ri­ence and to­tal cost of own­er­ship – with­out de­pend­ing on any sub­si­dies,” Mr Chang added.</p>
    <p>Un­like Scorpio, Ion plans to make its own bat­ter­ies.</p>
    <p>“We es­ti­mate our first batch of bat­tery packs to roll off the assem­bly line some time in the se­cond half of 2021,” Mr Chang said, not­ing that the com­pany would be the first elec­tric ve­hi­cle maker in the re­gion to “de­sign and de­velop our bat­tery pack in-house, with­out any help from ex­ter­nal con­sul­tants”.</p>
    <p>The com­pany has ap­pointed a Sin­ga­pore-based bat­tery pack cer­ti­fi­ca­tion ven­dor “with a wealth of safety and per­for­mance test­ing ex­pe­ri­ence and track record”.</p>
    <p>Ion, which re­cently se­cured US$3 mil­lion (S$4 mil­lion) in seed fund­ing, has seen its head­count tre­ble from five to 15 in the last six months.</p>
