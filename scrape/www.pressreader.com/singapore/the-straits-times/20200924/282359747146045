    <p>SYD­NEY • Aus­tralian flag car­rier Qan­tas axed its long-run­ning spon­sor­ship of the Wal­la­bies yes­ter­day as part of a coro­n­avirus-re­lated cost-cut­ting drive, deep­en­ing the fi­nan­cial cri­sis en­gulf­ing Rugby Aus­tralia (RA).</p>
    <p>The air­line said it could not jus­tify pay­ing for spon­sor­ships when the Covid-19 pan­demic meant it was cut­ting 2,500 jobs and had posted an an­nual pre-tax loss of A$2.7 bil­lion (S$2.6 bil­lion).</p>
    <p>“While we’re deal­ing with this cri­sis and its after­math, the cash cost of our spon­sor­ships has to be zero,” its chief cus­tomer of­fi­cer Stephanie Tully said in a state­ment.</p>
    <p>Qan­tas added that it would of­fer “in-kind” sup­port such as flights for Cricket Aus­tralia and Foot­ball Fed­er­a­tion Aus­tralia for the next 12 months, as well as sup­port­ing Aus­tralia’s Olympic and Par­a­lympic ath­letes at the Tokyo Games.</p>
    <p>But it has de­cided to com­pletely cut ties with the national rugby team as part of the spon­sor­ship shake-up, end­ing a 30-year as­so­ci­a­tion re­port­edly worth A$5 mil­lion an­nu­ally to the rugby body.</p>
    <p>The de­ci­sion is a huge blow to RA, which lost al­most A$10 mil­lion last year and axed 47 work­ers – a third of its staff – in June due to the pan­demic’s im­pact.</p>
    <p>The or­gan­i­sa­tion is also with­out a broad­cast part­ner af­ter an ill-timed ef­fort to push for a bet­ter deal co­in­cided with the sport­ing cal­en­dar be­ing shred­ded by the cri­sis.</p>
    <p>RA in­terim chief ex­ec­u­tive Rob Clarke called Qan­tas’ de­ci­sion “ob­vi­ously dis­ap­point­ing”, but hailed the air­line for its decades-long sup­port. “There aren’t many 30-year part­ner­ships in Aus­tralian sport and I want to thank Qan­tas for ev­ery­thing they have done for our great game,” he said in a state­ment.</p>
    <p>New Wal­la­bies coach Dave Ren­nie said he could not dis­agree with the rea­sons for dump­ing the deal.</p>
    <p>He told re­porters: “It’s been a tough time, and Qan­tas has been hugely af­fected by Covid and had to lay off a lot of staff. You can’t be lay­ing off staff and still be in­vest­ing money in a spon­sor­ship.”</p>
