    <p>MO­BIL­ITY AF­FECTED</p>
    <p>She can­not speak or re­spond yet. She just woke up and can only move the left side of her body. ’’</p>
    <p>MR ERIC TAN, fa­ther of Love­lynn who was flung out of a van in a road ac­ci­dent, on her con­di­tion.</p>
    <p>An eight-year-old girl who was flung out of a van in a road ac­ci­dent in Wood­lands last month woke up on Tues­day after 11 days in a coma.</p>
    <p>Her fa­ther, Mr Eric Tan, 45, told The New Pa­per on Tues­day night that Love­lynn re­gained con­scious­ness at about 4pm.</p>
    <p>“She can­not speak or re­spond yet. She just woke up and can only move the left side of her body,” he said in Man­darin.</p>
    <p>Ear­lier in the day, at about 7.30am, Mr Tan had posted an up­date on so­cial me­dia on his daugh­ter’s con­di­tion.</p>
    <p>He said the swelling in her brain had gone down and the blood clots were grad­u­ally dis­solv­ing. But mo­bil­ity on the right side of her body would be af­fected, and she is es­ti­mated to need a longer time to re­cover. “She will be re­quired to stay in ICU (in­ten­sive care unit) for fur­ther ob­ser­va­tion,” he wrote.</p>
    <p>Love­lynn is warded at KK Women’s and Chil­dren’s Hos­pi­tal, where Mr Tan and his wife have been keep­ing vigil.</p>
    <p>She was one of four peo­ple in­jured in the ac­ci­dent, in­volv­ing a van driven by her un­cle and a red Audi car, in Wood­lands Av­enue 12 just after 8pm on Oct 23.</p>
    <p>She had a head in­jury, broke both legs and needed emer­gency surgery. Also in the van were her sis­ter Lovelle, six, and two cousins – a woman, 23, and a man, 27, who needed surgery for a rup­tured spleen. A 32-year-old male pas­sen­ger in the Audi was also taken to hos­pi­tal.</p>
    <p>Lovelle was un­hurt and has been stay­ing with her aunt.</p>
    <p>Mr Tan’s brother-in-law, 56, was ar­rested for dan­ger­ous driv­ing caus­ing hurt. The po­lice are in­ves­ti­gat­ing the case.</p>
