    <p>831</p>
    <p>Num­ber of bil­lion­aires in the Asia-Pa­cific re­gion – about 38 per cent of the to­tal num­ber glob­ally.</p>
    <p>68</p>
    <p>Num­ber of fe­male bil­lion­aires in the re­gion, which has more than dou­bled from 26 in 2013. Over 60 per cent of them are en­trepreneur­s.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore has added three more bil­lion­aires to its tally over the past year or so, while the Asia-Pa­cific can again claim more uber-rich than any­where else in the world, ac­cord­ing to a report yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>It noted that the re­gion had 831 bil­lion­aires – about 38 per cent of the to­tal num­ber glob­ally – ac­count­ing for US$3.3 tril­lion (S$4.49 tril­lion) in to­tal or an av­er­age of about US$4 bil­lion each.</p>
    <p>The report from UBS and Price­wa­ter­house­C­oop­ers (PwC) stud­ied more than 2,000 bil­lion­aires from 43 mar­kets world­wide.</p>
    <p>The an­nual study would usu­ally have cov­ered the pe­riod from March 6 last year to April 7 this year but it was ex­tended to July 31 to take into ac­count the ef­fects of the coro­n­avirus pan­demic.</p>
    <p>It found that Sin­ga­pore had 25 bil­lion­aires as at July 31 – four more since the last sur­vey – but one dropped out dur­ing the ex­tended pe­riod from April 7.</p>
    <p>The report does not name the bil­lion­aires.</p>
    <p>To­tal bil­lion­aire wealth here grew by 11 per cent from the pre­vi­ous year’s study to reach US$79.1 bil­lion in April, but it surged 30 per cent to US$102.6 bil­lion in those ex­tra four months to the end of July.</p>
    <p>This trend is in line with a Vshaped re­bound in global stock mar­kets from April to July that pro­pelled global bil­lion­aire wealth to a new high of US$10.2 tril­lion.</p>
    <p>Mr Anuj Ka­gal­wala, part­ner and as­set and wealth man­age­ment tax leader with PwC Sin­ga­pore, said many bil­lion­aires would have had their wealth tied to busi­nesses listed on stock mar­kets.</p>
    <p>He also noted that the pan­demic has height­ened the di­vide be­tween in­no­va­tors and dis­rup­tors in the tech­nol­ogy, health­care and in­dus­trial sec­tors and oth­ers in ar­eas of the econ­omy that are now flag­ging.</p>
    <p>Asia-Pa­cific bil­lion­aires who can be iden­ti­fied as such in­no­va­tors and dis­rup­tors grew their wealth by 23 per cent to US$1.4 tril­lion over the study pe­riod, while tra­di­tional bil­lion­aires in­creased their worth by just 13 per cent.</p>
    <p>The re­gion also has 181 bil­lion­aires in health­care and tech­nol­ogy – the high­est share of the global bil­lion­aire pop­u­la­tion in these sec­tors.</p>
    <p>“It is in­ter­est­ing but not sur­pris­ing that wealth in the tech and health­care sec­tors surged ahead at a faster rate than other sec­tors,” said Mr Ka­gal­wala.</p>
    <p>“In the last decade, the wealth of bil­lion­aires in the tech sec­tor grew 5.7 times while the wealth of bil­lion­aires in the fi­nan­cial ser­vices sec­tor grew 2.3 times.</p>
    <p>“Fi­nan­cial ser­vices is seen to be a slower adopter of tech­nol­ogy and in­no­va­tion than other sec­tors.</p>
    <p>“Other sec­tors which have bet­ter adapted to tech­nol­ogy and in­no­va­tion such as in­dus­tri­als saw wealth grow 3.8 times dur­ing the same pe­riod. Tech­nol­ogy and in­no­va­tion seem to be key in­gre­di­ents for wealth cre­ation.”</p>
    <p>He noted that a strik­ing 81 per cent of bil­lion­aires in the Asia-Pa­cific are self-made, in­di­cat­ing a high level of op­por­tu­nity and growth here.</p>
    <p>That fig­ure is 98 per cent in main­land China, which set a new record of 415 bil­lion­aires this year de­spite the pan­demic. They hold a com­bined wealth of US$1.7 tril­lion.</p>
    <p>Be­sides just grow­ing wealth, bil­lion­aires in this re­gion are also in­creas­ingly fo­cused on mak­ing an im­pact in so­ci­ety, the report noted.</p>
    <p>Mr Anurag Ma­hesh, co-head of Asia-Pa­cific global fam­ily of­fice at UBS Global Wealth Man­age­ment, said: “Over the years, we have seen a rise in Asian bil­lion­aire fam­i­lies seek­ing pro­fes­sional ad­vice for be­spoke in­te­grated bank­ing so­lu­tions.</p>
    <p>“An in­creas­ing num­ber of Asian bil­lion­aire fam­i­lies have been cre­at­ing a pos­i­tive and sus­tain­able im­pact on so­ci­ety through phi­lan­thropy and sus­tain­able in­vest­ments.”</p>
    <p>Mr Ma­hesh said the trend in sus­tain­able in­vest­ment and phi­lan­thropy is set to in­crease, with the trans­fer of wealth to the younger gen­er­a­tion. He added that there is also a ris­ing in­ter­est among women in such in­vest­ments.</p>
    <p>Fe­male bil­lion­aires in the re­gion have more than dou­bled, from 26 in 2013 to 68, the high­est growth among all re­gions. Over 60 per cent of them are en­trepreneur­s.</p>
    <p>Mr Ka­gal­wala said: “The data is heart­en­ing. Es­pe­cially on the front of phi­lan­thropy, we are see­ing more and more fam­i­lies seek­ing to set up char­i­ta­ble foun­da­tions to sup­port causes, along­side their fam­ily of­fices.”</p>
