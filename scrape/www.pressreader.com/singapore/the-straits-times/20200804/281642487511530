    <p>Job cuts could be in the pipe­line for Sin­ga­pore Air­lines (SIA), which is now over­staffed for cur­rent de­mand, ex­perts said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>SIA could also try to cut costs in other ar­eas, or pos­si­bly re­ceive ad­di­tional gov­ern­ment sup­port to tide it through the cri­sis, they added.</p>
    <p>The air­line had last week an­nounced a net loss of $1.12 bil­lion in the quar­ter end­ing June 30 – its worst quar­terly show­ing. It also said it is re­view­ing the shape and size of its net­work over the longer term, given the im­pact of Covid-19 on air travel.</p>
    <p>The In­ter­na­tional Air Trans­port As­so­ci­a­tion has said it will take un­til 2024 for global pas­sen­ger traf­fic to re­turn to the level last year.</p>
    <p>Mr Ni­cholas Wy­att, head of re­search and anal­y­sis in travel and tourism at an­a­lyt­ics firm Glob­alData, said the re­cov­ery of in­ter­na­tional flights de­pends on how quickly the pan­demic can be brought un­der con­trol, but “there are few signs that this is hap­pen­ing”.</p>
    <p>But if air­lines cut jobs ex­ces­sively, they will be short­handed should the mar­ket re­bound quicker than ex­pected, he added.</p>
    <p>Other op­tions to man­age costs could in­clude rene­go­ti­at­ing deals with sup­pli­ers or cut­ting in-flight ameni­ties, said Mr Wy­att.</p>
    <p>Ms Joanna Lu, Asia’s head of con­sul­tancy at As­cend by Cir­ium, said that cut­ting staff costs, in­clud­ing through re­trench­ments, seems in­evitable with con­tin­ued low de­mand for air travel.</p>
    <p>“If there is no ma­jor break­through in con­tain­ing the virus in the next cou­ple of months, it is ex­tremely chal­leng­ing for SIA to sus­tain its busi­ness scale.”</p>
    <p>While SIA has reg­is­tered strong de­mand for cargo trans­port and could ben­e­fit from green lane ar­range­ments, Ms Lu said th­ese av­enues are only small parts of its busi­ness com­pared with be­fore Covid-19.</p>
    <p>It is not un­com­mon to see air­lines world­wide cut­ting staff costs through mea­sures like vol­un­tary re­tire­ments, fur­loughs and leaves of ab­sence, she added.</p>
    <p>As­so­ciate Pro­fes­sor Wal­ter Theseira, an econ­o­mist with the Sin­ga­pore Univer­sity of So­cial Sciences, noted that the crew man­power costs for SIA would have come down, given that crew are paid for the time spent in the air.</p>
    <p>He said: “For SIA and other in­ter­na­tional air­lines, it is re­ally about whether their con­tracts al­low them to pay crew the bare min­i­mum and whether the crew want to stay on.</p>
    <p>“I think what could work is if air­crew find out­side jobs that take up a sub­stan­tial por­tion of their time and be ros­tered to fly enough so as to keep their skills up, but that is eas­ier said than done.”</p>
    <p>SIA ex­pects its pas­sen­ger ca­pac­ity at the end of the se­cond quar­ter of the 2020/2021 fi­nan­cial year to be at just 7 per cent com­pared with the level be­fore Covid-19.</p>
    <p>Separately, its chief ex­ec­u­tive Goh Choon Phong an­nounced last week pay cuts for all man­age­ment and rank-and-file staff, as well as early re­tire­ment for ground staff and pi­lots. He also told staff to brace them­selves for ad­di­tional mea­sures.</p>
    <p>In the last few months, SIA has also been boost­ing its bal­ance sheet. It has raised $11 bil­lion since its fi­nan­cial year started in April.</p>
    <p>CIMB Pri­vate Bank­ing econ­o­mist Song Seng Wun said the Jobs Sup­port Scheme, which sub­sidises up to 75 per cent of wages for lo­cal work­ers in the avi­a­tion sec­tor, will be key to help­ing SIA re­tain work­ers. The scheme is set to stop af­ter this month.</p>
    <p>“I would say that there are com­pelling rea­sons for JSS to be ex­tended for some in­dus­tries which are still find­ing it ex­tremely dif­fi­cult to get back on their feet through no fault of theirs,” he said.</p>
    <p>“I think SIA value-adds to the econ­omy and con­trib­utes to Sin­ga­pore’s role as a trans­port hub... It is a na­tional icon that must be pro­tected and must be helped.”</p>
    <p>Mr Alan Tan, pres­i­dent of the Sin­ga­pore Air­lines Staff Union, noted that un­like some other car­ri­ers that have re­trenched cabin crew, SIA has man­aged to hang on to its crew so far. “We will work with the com­pany</p>
    <p>MAN­AG­ING MAN­POWER COSTS</p>
    <p>For SIA and other in­ter­na­tional air­lines, it is re­ally about whether their con­tracts al­low them to pay crew the bare min­i­mum and whether the crew want to stay on. I think what could work is if air­crew find out­side jobs that take up a sub­stan­tial por­tion of their time and be ros­tered to fly enough so as to keep their skills up, but that is eas­ier said than done.’’</p>
    <p>AS­SO­CIATE PRO­FES­SOR WAL­TER THESEIRA, an econ­o­mist with the Sin­ga­pore Univer­sity of So­cial Sciences.</p>
    <p>to con­tinue to do what we can, but given how badly the global air travel in­dus­try is do­ing, it will hon­estly take a mir­a­cle for us to keep all of them in­def­i­nitely,” he said.</p>
