    <p>If there is one thing jockey Ryan Munger would like to have when he leaves Sin­ga­pore to­mor­row for his na­tive South Africa, it would be to pack a sil­ver­ware in his lug­gage.</p>
    <p>The 25-year-old has gar­nered his fair share of win­ners – 18 – in about nine months of rid­ing at Kranji, but the fea­ture races have eluded him.</p>
    <p>He came ag­o­nis­ingly close in all three Group 1 legs of the Sin­ga­pore Triple Crown. He fin­ished sec­ond on Sun Mar­shal in the Raf­fles Cup and played sec­ond fid­dle on Min­is­ter in the Queen El­iz­a­beth II Cup and Sin­ga­pore Gold Cup.</p>
    <p>To­day’s Colo­nial Chief Stakes over the Poly­track 1,600m may only be a Group 3 fea­ture, but Munger will still re­ceive it with open arms. The $150,000 race is the fi­nal fea­ture race of the sea­son.</p>
    <p>He has a de­cent hope on the Michael Cle­ments-trained Sin­cerely, whom he rode to sec­ond last start in a Kranji Stakes B race over 1,600m on turf.</p>
    <p>“Af­ter all the sec­onds, it’s great to have one more chance of leav­ing with some sil­ver­ware in the suit­case. That would be the cherry on the top if I win that race,” said the for­mer Zim­babwe cham­pion ap­pren­tice, who achieved three Group 3 suc­cesses back home.</p>
    <p>“I also have a very nice card (nine rides from 10 races). The more, the mer­rier, to end on a win­ning note would also be great.</p>
    <p>“I’m very happy with Sin­cerely. I gal­loped him (on Wed­nes­day morn­ing) and he’s feel­ing good, and has come on from his last run.”</p>
    <p>That day, Sin­cerely was shouted the win­ner un­til Sky Rocket lived up to his name to beat him by half a length. His con­queror is also vy­ing for the Colo­nial Chief Stakes but will be con­ced­ing 2.5kg to him.</p>
    <p>“He’s def­i­nitely good for this type of race. It’s a winnable race, where none of the star Group 1 horses are in,” said Munger.</p>
    <p>“They are your ev­ery­day Class 2 horses. All of them stand a chance, none of them is a real dan­ger. But, if I had to pick one, it would have to be Sky Rocket.</p>
    <p>“But I can’t fault my horse. I have got to know him bet­ter af­ter that first ride, he has drawn well (Gate 4) and the dis­tance is def­i­nitely up his al­ley.</p>
    <p>“So, he has a lot of pos­i­tives in his favour. My only con­cern is his first time on the all-weather here. But he’s work­ing good on the Poly­track, and I think he can give a good ac­count of him­self.”</p>
    <p>Munger will no doubt get an ex­tra shot of con­fi­dence if the records were dug up. Then known as Quin­dio in six starts in France when com­pet­ing on the pro­vin­cial cir­cuit for trainer Xavier ThomasDe­meaulte, Sin­cerely won a 1,500m race on the fi­bre­sand track at Pau in Jan­uary last year.</p>
    <p>Cle­ments is also hope­ful of Sin­cerely’s chances in Race 9 to­day.</p>
    <p>“From his first-up win in a sprint race, he has con­tin­ued along that path. It’s only at his last start that he has run the speed out of him­self,” he said. “He has shown he was look­ing for ex­tra dis­tance and the Colo­nial Chief Stakes has come at the right time for him.”</p>
