    <p>Ten-year-old Naomi Tan and her 12-year-old brother, Karls­son, are not get­ting Christ­mas presents this year. And they are fine with it.</p>
    <p>Their mother, Ms Kather­ine Chua, was re­trenched in July and started her cur­rent job as a sec­re­tary in a man­u­fac­tur­ing firm last month.</p>
    <p>“With Covid-19, you learn to bet­ter ap­pre­ci­ate what you have. Now is not the right time to be a spend­thrift,” says the 46-year-old, who is mar­ried to a post­man. They have three older chil­dren aged 16, 22 and 25.</p>
    <p>The kids usu­ally get one or two fes­tive gifts. Dur­ing their an­nual Christ­mas gath­er­ing with 15 other rel­a­tives, each fam­ily mem­ber gets a present through a lucky draw. Ms Chua buys the kids a sec­ond present if there is an “ex­tra bonus” that year.</p>
    <p>Due to so­cial dis­tanc­ing re­stric­tions, the Christ­mas gath­er­ing this year has been can­celled. Be­sides no presents and no party, there will be no Christ­mas tree and the fes­tive feast will be a scaled-down af­fair.</p>
    <p>While Ms Chua will still be mak­ing roast chicken and potato gratin, there will be no roast beef or sa­tay, which her rel­a­tives nor­mally bring as potluck of­fer­ings.</p>
    <p>In­stead of putting up a Christ­mas tree – their plas­tic tree was worn from use and dis­carded last Christ­mas – Ms Chua has bought dec­o­ra­tive sprigs to adorn the doors in their Hous­ing Board flat and set the Yule­tide mood.</p>
    <p>Amid a “corona-re­ces­sion”, many fam­i­lies are cut­ting back on fes­tive trim­mings as they re­flect on a year dom­i­nated by Covid-19.</p>
    <p>Sur­pris­ingly, the young­sters are tak­ing the bud­get cuts in their stride.</p>
    <p>Naomi says: “It’s okay, we don’t want to get Covid-19. Our gath­er­ing will be shifted to next year so we’ll have dou­ble the presents.”</p>
    <p>Karls­son is look­ing for­ward to see­ing a snow dis­play at Jewel Changi Air­port in­stead.</p>
    <p>Ms Chua at­tributes her two younger kids’ prag­matic sen­si­bil­ity to their free­lance stints act­ing in ad­ver­tise­ments over the past two years, where they earned a cou­ple of hun­dred dol­lars each time. She let them spend $20 on toys and steered them to­wards spend­ing the rest on “more mean­ing­ful” items like books or sav­ing it.</p>
    <p>“It en­forced the idea that mak­ing money is not easy,” she says. Ms Abi­gail Chuah, man­ager at Hope Cen­tre (Sin­ga­pore), which pro­vides com­mu­nity ser­vices for chil­dren, youth and se­niors, is opt­ing for cheaper gifts this Christ­mas be­cause of the pre­car­i­ous cli­mate wrought by the pan­demic. “Work­ing in a char­i­ta­ble or­gan­i­sa­tion, I’m aware there are a lot of needs, es­pe­cially among lowly skilled work­ers who are out of a job. Covid-19 made me re­alise how vul­ner­a­ble our lives are and how un­pre­dictable. I want to spend pru­dently to help those in need,” says Ms Chuah, 37, who is mar­ried to a 34-year-old cod­ing in­struc­tor. The cou­ple have a one-year-old daugh­ter.</p>
    <p>She and her hus­band typ­i­cally buy 100 gifts ev­ery Christ­mas for friends and fam­ily. She will be giv­ing fewer presents this year as large cel­e­bra­tions are not al­lowed. In­stead, she is bak­ing cook­ies to give away and plans on do­nat­ing more to char­ity.</p>
    <p>For oth­ers, care­ful Christ­mas spend­ing is part of a long-stand­ing habit of fi­nan­cial pru­dence.</p>
    <p>Mr Nic Tse, 31, fi­nance ed­i­tor at fi­nan­cial com­par­i­son web­site SingSaver, says: “I al­ways keep an eye out for ways to cut back on spend­ing, Covid-19 or not. As I had my per­sonal sys­tem in place, I didn’t have to make last-ditch at­tempts to cut down on Christ­mas spend­ing.”</p>
    <p>He usu­ally spends Christ­mas Eve at a stay­ca­tion with his girl­friend at a lux­ury ho­tel, which can cost up to $600. In Au­gust, when few were think­ing about mistle­toe, he snagged a deal for 40 per cent off for his up­com­ing fes­tive stay.</p>
    <p>For In­sti­tute of Tech­ni­cal Ed­u­ca­tion lec­turer Ben­jamin Kwek and his wife, cost-cut­ting means mak­ing their own Christ­mas tree with their three daugh­ters, aged seven, nine and 12.</p>
    <p>Fol­low­ing a Christ­mas prac­tice since 2017, the Kweks make use of re­cy­cled ma­te­ri­als such as bam­boo poles, cable ties, string, grid wire mesh, mask­ing tape and ice-cream sticks. Their 1.5m-tall home­made tree even has ta­ble-leg socks at the bot­tom to pre­vent the poles, usu­ally used for hang­ing clothes, from scratch­ing the floor.</p>
    <p>The gar­lands that make up the “branches”, lights and or­na­ments were bought on 50 per cent dis­count from Ja­pan Home store.</p>
    <p>Mr Kwek, 43, says: “Christ­mas is al­ways a big thing for us as we’re Chris­tians. Since I started work­ing from home, I’ve been tak­ing the time to en­joy be­ing with my kids.</p>
    <p>“Mak­ing our own Christ­mas tree is a way to do some­thing fun to­gether. Be­sides, get­ting the kids in­volved stops them from be­ing glued to the TV, lap­top, YouTube and K-pop.”</p>
