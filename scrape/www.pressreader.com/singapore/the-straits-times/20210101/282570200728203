    <p>NEW YORK • The party that in­tro­duced the De­sign Works of Bed­ford-Stuyvesant tex­tile col­lec­tion at the Metropoli­tan Museum of Art in Oc­to­ber 1971 drew quite a crowd.</p>
    <p>Ethel Kennedy was in at­ten­dance along with Babe Pa­ley, the so­cialite; so were Diana Vree­land, the ed­i­tor of Vogue, and Bunny Mel­lon, the phi­lan­thropist and hor­ti­cul­tur­al­ist.</p>
    <p>The guest who got the most at­ten­tion that evening, how­ever, was Mrs Jac­que­line KennedyO­nas­sis.</p>
    <p>The col­lec­tion was an ini­tia­tive of the Bed­ford-Stuyvesant Restora­tion Corp, the first com­mu­nity de­vel­op­ment cor­po­ra­tion to be es­tab­lished in the United States.</p>
    <p>The re­sult of leg­is­la­tion cham­pi­oned by Sen­a­tor Robert Kennedy in 1966, the cor­po­ra­tion sought to stim­u­late the lo­cal econ­omy of Bed­ford-Stuyvesant with pro­grammes for em­ploy­ment, ed­u­ca­tion, health­care and de­vel­op­ment.</p>
    <p>In 1969, in­spired by her broth­erin-law’s ef­forts, Mrs Onas­sis cre­ated De­sign Works to am­plify the tal­ents of artists in the area.</p>
    <p>She asked her friends, D.D. and Les­lie Til­lett, the hus­band-and­wife de­sign team be­hind Til­lett Tex­tiles, to col­lab­o­rate.</p>
    <p>The cou­ple’s vivid, large-scale, screen-printed fab­rics – cre­ated by hand in their small Man­hat­tan­based print­ing op­er­a­tion – were favoured by top de­sign­ers and in­flu­en­tial fig­ures, in­clud­ing Onas­sis, who used the tex­tiles for up­hol­stery and draperies in the liv­ing ar­eas of The White House.</p>
    <p>The late Til­letts’ grand­son, Mr Pa­trick McBride, 48, now owns and op­er­ates the busi­ness.</p>
    <p>The idea at the time was that the cou­ple would teach their sig­na­ture tech­niques for silk-screen de­sign and print­ing to young peo­ple in Bed­ford-Stuyvesant, who would then go on to pro­duce hand­printed fab­rics for the de­sign trade on their own.</p>
    <p>The fab­rics cre­ated by De­sign Works of Bed­ford-Stuyvesant were de­signed by mem­bers of the com­mu­nity.</p>
    <p>They fea­tured mo­tifs that in­cluded ab­stract fish scales, ze­bra stripes, over­sized ba­nana leaves, roost­ers and cowrie shells, along with bold geo­met­ric prints and stylised ab­stracts.</p>
    <p>“The colours were in­cred­i­bly sat­u­rated,” he said.</p>
    <p>In the 1970s, ready for a slower pace, his grand­par­ents moved op­er­a­tions to Sh­effield, Mas­sachusetts, where they re­main.</p>
    <p>The li­brary there con­tains more than 900 pat­terns de­signed by the Til­letts dat­ing back to the 1940s, in­clud­ing sev­eral cre­ated in col­lab­o­ra­tion with De­sign Works.</p>
    <p>“There are a lot of sto­ries in those hun­dreds of pat­terns,” Mr McBride said. “I felt like the De­sign Works story was one that needed to be told.”</p>
    <p>His way of telling the tale now is to rein­tro­duce the fab­rics from the col­lab­o­ra­tion of Til­lett and De­sign Works, with a por­tion of the prof­its to be donated to the Kips Bay Boys and Girls Club.</p>
    <p>Four pat­terns in three colour­ways have re­cently be­come avail­able to the trade. Tote bags, throw pil­lows and face masks in these pat­terns may be or­dered through the com­pany’s In­sta­gram ac­count (@tillett­tex­tiles).</p>
    <p>“We’ll re­lease other pat­terns from De­sign Works grad­u­ally,” said McBride, not­ing that the fab­rics are made of Bel­gian linen, which is more mod­ern and lux­u­ri­ous than what was avail­able dur­ing the 1970s.</p>
    <p>“There has been a resur­gence of us­ing vi­brant, rich colours in in­te­ri­ors,” he said.</p>
    <p>“Peo­ple are feel­ing ex­cited about colour. Re­leas­ing these fab­rics in their orig­i­nal sat­u­rated rich, tones is au­then­tic to his­tory and lends it­self to what’s go­ing on in the de­sign world to­day.”</p>
