    <p>A re­cent sur­vey on work­place re­silience has found that close to six in 10 Sin­ga­pore­ans were sat­is­fied with how the Gov­ern­ment man­aged the Covid-19 sit­u­a­tion, though they may feel stressed by the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>About 57 per cent of the re­spon­dents felt that the Gov­ern­ment had a good grasp of the sit­u­a­tion. About 29 per cent were neu­tral on this, while around 15 per cent felt the Gov­ern­ment did not have a good grasp of the Covid-19 sit­u­a­tion.</p>
    <p>The sur­vey also showed that some 75 per cent of the re­spon­dents were sat­is­fied with the timely and use­ful in­for­ma­tion the Gov­ern­ment had pro­vided on the Covid-19 sit­u­a­tion, with 20 per cent feel­ing neu­tral and just 5 per cent who felt they were not re­ceiv­ing use­ful and timely in­for­ma­tion.</p>
    <p>The sur­vey was con­ducted by the Na­tional Univer­sity Health Sys­tem’s (NUHS) Mind Science Cen­tre, with the help of com­mu­nity re­source plat­form ia­maccb.sg</p>
    <p>Launched on the plat­form on May 20, the sur­vey had at­tracted 1,407 re­spon­dents by the time it wrapped up on June 15.</p>
    <p>The re­spon­dents could choose from five an­swers – from strongly agree to neu­tral to strongly dis­agree – when re­spond­ing to 10 state­ments.</p>
    <p>Speak­ing yes­ter­day on The Big Story, The Straits Times’ week­day talk show, As­so­ciate Pro­fes­sor John Wong, di­rec­tor of NUHS’ Mind Science Cen­tre, noted that the re­sponses to the two state­ments on the Gov­ern­ment’s man­age­ment of the pan­demic and its dis­sem­i­na­tion of in­for­ma­tion were en­cour­ag­ing, given how quickly the pan­demic was evolv­ing.</p>
    <p>This is the same sur­vey that had found that more of those work­ing from home feel stressed than those work­ing on the front line of the pan­demic. Some 61 per cent of those work­ing from home felt stressed, com­pared with 53 per cent of front liners, The Straits Times re­ported ear­lier.</p>
    <p>More peo­ple in the work-fromhome group (51 per cent) also re­ported feel­ing stressed at home, com­pared with the group who are on the front line of the pan­demic (32 per cent).</p>
