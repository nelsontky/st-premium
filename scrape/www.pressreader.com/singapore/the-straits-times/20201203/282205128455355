    <p>Peo­ple to­day ex­pect dig­i­tal ser­vices to be im­me­di­ate and cus­tomised, and the Gov­ern­ment must be ready to in­cor­po­rate the best so­lu­tions from the pri­vate sec­tor to meet these ex­pec­ta­tions, Min­is­ter-in-charge of the Smart Na­tion Ini­tia­tive Vi­vian Balakr­ish­nan said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>This, in turn, al­lows the Gov­ern­ment to be­come a “ref­er­ence cus­tomer” for pri­vate com­pa­nies sell­ing ser­vices to the pub­lic sec­tor, open­ing up more op­por­tu­ni­ties for them, Dr Balakr­ish­nan said at the Stack 2020 De­vel­oper Con­fer­ence or­gan­ised by the Gov­ern­ment Tech­nol­ogy Agency.</p>
    <p>He pointed to two re­cent ini­tia­tives as ex­am­ples of how the Gov­ern­ment in­tends to fos­ter pub­lic-pri­vate col­lab­o­ra­tion in “both ac­tion and words”, in­clud­ing ef­forts to tap com­mer­cial cloud ser­vices.</p>
    <p>“We are work­ing with three lead­ing providers – Ama­zon Web Ser­vices, Mi­crosoft Azure and Google Cloud Plat­form – to bring the cut­ting edge of cloud tech­nol­ogy to bear in the dig­i­tal ser­vices we pro­vide our cit­i­zens,” he said.</p>
    <p>Prime Min­is­ter Lee Hsien Loong had an­nounced in 2018 that the Gov­ern­ment would be­gin to move some of its IT sys­tems to a com­mer­cial cloud ser­vice.</p>
    <p>More than 150 sys­tems have been moved to the cloud ser­vice as of June this year, in­clud­ing</p>
    <p>those in­volv­ing tax ad­min­is­tra­tion and elec­tronic ex­am­i­na­tions.</p>
    <p>Dr Balakr­ish­nan, who is also For­eign Min­is­ter, drew at­ten­tion to the Sin­ga­pore Gov­ern­ment De­vel­oper Por­tal, soft-launched ear­lier this year, which gives soft­ware de­vel­op­ers key in­for­ma­tion on gov­ern­ment tech so­lu­tions and the abil­ity to build on and in­te­grate them into their own ap­pli­ca­tions.</p>
    <p>“What we re­ally hope is that you will use these tools to build, test and im­prove your dig­i­tal prod­ucts, and also to pitch them</p>
    <p>to us,” he told the de­vel­op­ers.</p>
    <p>“Be­cause if it works, we want to in­cor­po­rate that into our suite of ser­vices as well.”</p>
    <p>Dur­ing a di­a­logue at the con­fer­ence, Dr Balakr­ish­nan said both he and PM Lee took a keen in­ter­est in the de­vel­op­ments on the por­tal, and “will al­ways be there to ask the awk­ward ques­tions”.</p>
    <p>Gov­ern­ment chief dig­i­tal tech­nol­ogy of­fi­cer Chan Cheow Hoe, who was also part of the di­a­logue, said a sup­port­ive lead­er­ship has been “very im­por­tant” in help­ing Sin­ga­pore to move quickly and</p>
    <p>ef­fec­tively in the tech space, adding that the gov­ern­ment tech ecosys­tem has come a long way since he joined the agency in 2014.</p>
    <p>“When I first joined, the big­gest chal­lenge was that we didn’t have the plat­forms. So my poor en­gi­neers had to code on their computers, put in a thumb drive, take a bus to the data cen­tre and then plug the thumb drive in (in or­der to up­load the code),” he said.</p>
    <p>“So the democrati­sa­tion of tech­nol­ogy in terms of (so­lu­tions like) the cloud has made us a lot more ef­fec­tive and able to de­liver</p>
    <p>(re­sults) in weeks, which was im­pos­si­ble be­fore.”</p>
    <p>This year’s Stack con­fer­ence, tak­ing place over two days start­ing yes­ter­day, is held in a vir­tual for­mat. It is the sec­ond edi­tion af­ter the in­au­gu­ral one in 2018.</p>
    <p>The con­fer­ence brings to­gether de­vel­op­ers from the pub­lic and pri­vate sec­tors to share knowl­edge on a wide va­ri­ety of top­ics, such as cloud tech­nol­ogy, app devel­op­ment and a new seg­ment on Covid-19 tech.</p>
