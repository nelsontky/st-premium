    <p>In­dia has cau­tiously opened up lim­ited air travel with a clutch of coun­tries, in­clud­ing the United States and the United Arab Emirates. In­dia can­celled all flights be­fore a strin­gent lock­down on March 25, which also stopped travel within the coun­try. It has been op­er­at­ing repa­tri­a­tion flights since May 7 to al­low stranded cit­i­zens to re­turn home.</p>
    <p>In­dia has cau­tiously opened up lim­ited air travel with a clutch of coun­tries in­clud­ing the US and United Arab Emirates (UAE).</p>
    <p>Amer­i­can car­rier United Air­lines last Fri­day started op­er­at­ing 18 flights from Ne­wark and San Fran­cisco to Delhi, fol­low­ing an air bub­ble agree­ment. The flights, till the end of the month, fol­low an ac­cu­sa­tion by Wash­ing­ton that Delhi was un­fairly op­er­at­ing paid flights un­der its repa­tri­a­tion pro­gramme amid the Covid-19 pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Na­tional car­rier, Air In­dia, which has con­ducted the repa­tri­a­tion flights, will now be al­lowed to op­er­ate sep­a­rate com­mer­cial flights based on de­mand, with sched­ules that have yet to be fi­nalised.</p>
    <p>An air bub­ble agree­ment is a deal be­tween two coun­tries, chalk­ing out re­stric­tions and reg­u­la­tions un­der which flights by air­lines of the two coun­tries can op­er­ate.</p>
    <p>Sim­i­lar agree­ments have been worked out with the UAE, France and Ger­many, while ne­go­ti­a­tions with Bri­tain are in the fi­nal stages. Flights to the UAE be­gan on July 12.</p>
    <p>Air France last Satur­day started 28 flights to Delhi/Mum­bai and Ben­galuru. These will run till Aug 1, said the civil avi­a­tion min­istry.</p>
    <p>“Un­til in­ter­na­tional civil avi­a­tion can re­claim its pre-Covid-19 sit­u­a­tion in terms of num­bers, the an­swer will lie in bi­lat­eral air bub­ble agree­ments which will carry as many peo­ple as pos­si­ble un­der de­fined con­di­tions,” Civil Avi­a­tion Min­is­ter Hardeep Singh Puri told a press con­fer­ence last Thurs­day.</p>
    <p>He said that apart from a valid visa, pas­sen­gers would re­quire ad­di­tional gov­ern­ment ap­proval to travel un­der these agree­ments and that the arrangemen­ts would be re­viewed at the end of two weeks.</p>
    <p>“Be­cause many coun­tries are still im­pos­ing en­try re­stric­tions, as are we, it’s not that any­one can travel from any­where to any­where. You need per­mis­sion. These are in the ini­tial ex­per­i­men­tal stage. We are op­er­at­ing un­der strict stan­dard op­er­at­ing pro­ce­dures.”</p>
    <p>He noted that this was “not nor­mal com­mer­cial oper­a­tions” and that the num­ber of pas­sen­gers also de­pended on the ca­pac­ity for quar­an­tine.</p>
    <p>The Civil Avi­a­tion Min­istry has said do­mes­tic land­ing and quar­an­tine rules will ap­ply.</p>
    <p>At Delhi air­port, for in­stance, in­ter­na­tional ar­rivals have to un­dergo a seven-day quar­an­tine at a des­ig­nated fa­cil­ity and a fur­ther seven days at home.</p>
    <p>In­dia can­celled all in­ter­na­tional flights two days be­fore a strin­gent lock­down on March 25, which also stopped travel within the coun­try. The lock­down has since been eased in stages. All curbs on cross-coun­try move­ments have also been lifted but in­di­vid­ual cities and ar­eas have con­tin­ued to main­tain cer­tain re­stric­tions to con­trol the spread of the coro­n­avirus.</p>
    <p>And although do­mes­tic flights have re­sumed, Covid-19 fears have kept peo­ple from trav­el­ling. Flights are op­er­at­ing at barely one-third ca­pac­ity since the re­sump­tion of do­mes­tic flights.</p>
    <p>The cities worst-af­fected by the pan­demic – such as Delhi, Mum­bai and Ben­galuru – are also among the coun­try’s avi­a­tion hubs, fur­ther com­pli­cat­ing the re­sump­tion of avi­a­tion ac­tiv­i­ties.</p>
    <p>“The fact is that they have to open up in­ter­na­tional travel and they are do­ing it very cau­tiously. They are tak­ing baby steps and test­ing. This is a pre­lude to com­plete open­ing,” said Mr Ra­jan Mehra, chief ex­ec­u­tive of­fi­cer of Club One Air, and for­mer In­dia head of Qatar Air­ways.</p>
    <p>“Things are so un­cer­tain. But this is a pos­i­tive step. They need to keep mov­ing for­ward in­stead of look­ing back,” he added.</p>
    <p>In­dia has been op­er­at­ing repa­tri­a­tion flights since May 7 to al­low its cit­i­zens stranded over­seas to re­turn home. More than 680,000 peo­ple have taken these repa­tri­a­tion flights, in­clud­ing from Sin­ga­pore.</p>
