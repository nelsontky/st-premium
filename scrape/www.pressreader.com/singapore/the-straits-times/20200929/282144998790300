    <p>The Mon­e­tary Au­thor­ity of Sin­ga­pore (MAS) is in talks with lenders about ex­tend­ing the Repub­lic’s debt mora­to­rium pro­gramme be­yond Dec 31 to pro­vide ex­tra re­lief for bor­row­ers hit by the fall­out from the coro­n­avirus pan­demic, ac­cord­ing to peo­ple with knowl­edge of the mat­ter.</p>
    <p>One of the key mea­sures be­ing dis­cussed is the pos­si­bil­ity of length­en­ing the debt re­lief pro­gramme, with in­dus­tries that have been im­pacted most by the cri­sis po­ten­tially hav­ing aid ex­tended by up to six months, the peo­ple said, ask­ing not to be iden­ti­fied be­cause the talks are con­fi­den­tial.</p>
    <p>A tiered ap­proach is be­ing con­sid­ered, so re­lief is tar­geted at those need­ing the most help, one of the peo­ple said.</p>
    <p>De­tails of the plan and what types of bor­row­ers will be cov­ered un­der an ex­ten­sion are still be­ing fi­nalised, they said.</p>
    <p>Un­der the cur­rent mea­sures an­nounced in March, small and medium-sized firms can opt to post­pone prin­ci­pal pay­ments on their se­cured term loans un­til the year end. Con­sumers can de­fer both prin­ci­pal and in­ter­est pay­ments on res­i­den­tial mort­gages. In­di­vid­u­als suf­fer­ing a loss of in­come can ask for a lower in­ter­est rate on unsecured credit.</p>
    <p>An ex­ten­sion of the debt mora­to­rium would help mit­i­gate the so­called “cliff ef­fect” on con­sumers and busi­nesses once re­lief mea­sures end. The au­thor­i­ties are us­ing both fis­cal and mon­e­tary tools to pro­vide sup­port against what may be a record re­ces­sion that came with the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>The Gov­ern­ment in­tro­duced ad­di­tional sup­port mea­sures of $8 bil­lion last month to cush­ion the blow from the virus, bring­ing Sin­ga­pore’s to­tal pledged pan­demic aid to more than $100 bil­lion.</p>
    <p>MAS man­ag­ing di­rec­tor Ravi Menon in July said the reg­u­la­tor was talk­ing to banks and fi­nance com­pa­nies about how to ease bor­row­ers into grad­u­ally re­sum­ing re­pay­ments once the debt re­lief mea­sures ex­pire. “We want to avoid ‘cliff ef­fects’ of a sud­den with­drawal of these re­liefs,” he told re­porters dur­ing the pub­li­ca­tion of the MAS an­nual re­port.</p>
    <p>The cen­tral bank has eased mon­e­tary pol­icy to help sta­bilise the econ­omy, and has en­sured am­ple liq­uid­ity at fi­nan­cial in­sti­tu­tions. It also asked Sin­ga­pore banks to pri­ori­tise lend­ing by cap­ping their div­i­dend pay­outs.</p>
    <p>While Sin­ga­pore’s rate of coro­n­avirus in­fec­tion is fall­ing and the au­thor­i­ties are try­ing to grad­u­ally re­open the econ­omy, many re­stric­tions on busi­nesses and travel re­main in place.</p>
    <p>Like their global com­peti­tors, Sin­ga­pore’s largest lenders DBS Bank, OCBC Bank and United Over­seas Bank (UOB) are brac­ing them­selves for a wave of soured debts. Col­lec­tively, they have set aside about $4 bil­lion in pro­vi­sions for both gen­eral and prob­lem loans in the first half of the year, ac­cord­ing to data tracked by Bloomberg In­tel­li­gence an­a­lyst Rena Kwok.</p>
    <p>As of June 30, debts un­der re­lief pro­grammes ac­counted for about 5 per cent of DBS’ to­tal loan book, 10 per cent of OCBC’s, and 16 per cent of UOB’s, ac­cord­ing to their sec­ond-quar­ter re­sults.</p>
