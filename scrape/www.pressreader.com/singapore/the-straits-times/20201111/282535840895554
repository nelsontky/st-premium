    <p>What some peo­ple may not be aware of is that pso­ri­a­sis is not only a dis­ease of the skin and joints, but also a sys­temic dis­ease that is as­so­ci­ated with a range of co­mor­bidi­ties, es­pe­cially metabolic syn­drome and car­dio­vas­cu­lar dis­ease.</p>
    <p>Part-time mar­ke­teer Aileen Chan was di­ag­nosed with pso­ri­a­sis at the age of 46 in 2011. She had to stop go­ing for mas­sages be­cause the chronic dis­ease is marked by itchy, red scaly patches on the skin.</p>
    <p>Ms Chan said the pso­ri­a­sis be­came ag­gres­sive three to four years ago. She al­ready had hy­per­ten­sion, and more health is­sues be­gan to crop up.</p>
    <p>She was di­ag­nosed with di­a­betes in 2015. Since then, she has had treat­ment for early-stage breast can­cer, and found out she has liver cir­rho­sis and other health is­sues.</p>
    <p>What some peo­ple may not be aware of is that pso­ri­a­sis is not only a dis­ease of the skin and joints, but also a sys­temic dis­ease that is as­so­ci­ated with a range of co­mor­bidi­ties, es­pe­cially metabolic syn­drome and car­dio­vas­cu­lar dis­ease.</p>
    <p>Dr Colin Theng, pres­i­dent of the Pso­ri­a­sis As­so­ci­a­tion of Sin­ga­pore, said that while the as­so­ci­a­tion be­tween pso­ri­a­sis and metabolic syn­drome is known, the preva­lence of it here was shown only re­cently, in a lo­cal study pub­lished dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker.</p>
    <p>The preva­lence of metabolic syn­drome in pso­ri­a­sis pa­tients was 45.1 per cent, or nearly three­fold higher than that in the pop­u­la­tion in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>“This means that if you have pso­ri­a­sis, you are three times more likely to have metabolic syn­drome, com­pared with an in­di­vid­ual who does not have pso­ri­a­sis,” said Dr</p>
    <p>Theng, a co-au­thor of the study.</p>
    <p>He said this means all pa­tients with pso­ri­a­sis should be screened, par­tic­u­larly those above the age of 50, who have a higher risk of de­vel­op­ing metabolic syn­drome.</p>
    <p>Metabolic syn­drome has a clus­ter of risk fac­tors, in­clud­ing obe­sity, hy­per­ten­sion, dys­lip­i­daemia and glu­cose in­tol­er­ance. It is also a strong pre­dic­tor of car­dio­vas­cu­lar dis­ease, di­a­betes and stroke.</p>
    <p>The study looked at 338 pa­tients in Sin­ga­pore, aged 18 to 69, who had sought help from late 2007 to early 2009 at the Na­tional Skin Cen­tre (NSC).</p>
    <p>It found that hav­ing a se­vere form of pso­ri­a­sis did not ap­pear to put the pa­tient at a higher risk of metabolic syn­drome, said Dr Theng, who is in pri­vate prac­tice.</p>
    <p>In Ms Chan’s case, it was not just metabolic syn­drome, but also her liver cir­rho­sis, that could be due to pso­ri­a­sis.</p>
    <p>Dr Theng said pa­tients with pso­ri­a­sis have an in­creased risk of de­vel­op­ing fatty liver dis­ease, which can in­crease the risk of de­vel­op­ing liver cir­rho­sis in some in­di­vid­u­als. Some sys­temic med­i­ca­tions can also af­fect the liver, which may con­trib­ute to the cir­rho­sis, he added.</p>
    <p>Ms Chan’s breast can­cer and other health scares, how­ever, may not be due to pso­ri­a­sis, he said.</p>
    <p>An­other co-au­thor of the study, Dr Hazel Oon, a se­nior con­sul­tant at the NSC, said that within metabolic syn­drome, the most com­mon risk fac­tor was el­e­vated blood pres­sure, fol­lowed by obe­sity, low HDL (high-den­sity lipopro­tein or “good”) choles­terol, raised triglyc­erides and el­e­vated fast­ing glu­cose.</p>
    <p>World­wide, about 125 mil­lion peo­ple have pso­ri­a­sis, in­clud­ing Amer­i­can re­al­ity tele­vi­sion star Kim Kardashian and coun­try mu­sic star LeAnn Rimes.</p>
    <p>Rimes even showed off the red spots dot­ting her body by pos­ing nude for Glam­our magazine to mark World Pso­ri­a­sis Day on Oct 29. She said stress from the</p>
    <p>Covid-19 pan­demic caused her pso­ri­a­sis to flare up.</p>
    <p>Pso­ri­a­sis is the 10th most com­mon skin dis­or­der for those seek­ing treat­ment at the NSC. Some 1 to 3 per cent of the pop­u­la­tion may have it. The dis­ease is thought to be due to a prob­lem with the im­mune sys­tem. It is char­ac­terised by rapid skin cell growth. Nor­mal skin cells grow and shed in three to four weeks, but in pso­ri­a­sis, this hap­pens in a few days. Most pa­tients have the mild form, and small parts of their bod­ies are af­fected, while about 20 per cent have the mod­er­ate to se­vere form of the con­di­tion.</p>
    <p>The scaly patches can ap­pear any­where on the body, al­though com­mon af­fected ar­eas in­clude the lower back, knees, el­bows and scalp. In­di­vid­u­als can go through pe­ri­ods of flare-ups and re­mis­sions, and there is no cure, al­though the dis­ease is not con­ta­gious.</p>
    <p>For Ms Chan, her pso­ri­a­sis started with red rashes the size of 50-cent coins on her thigh. Now, it has spread to al­most all over her body, she said.</p>
    <p>“It’s slowly spread­ing on my hair­line and the base of neck, so I am cov­er­ing it with my hair,” she said.</p>
    <p>“The pain and itch keep me up at night... Ev­ery two to three hours, I would be ap­ply­ing moisturise­r,” she added.</p>
    <p>Ms Chan will be try­ing bi­o­log­ics next. These drugs tar­get only spe­cific parts of the im­mune sys­tem and are costly. She plans to start on jabs this month. Hers will cost $4,850 each, and she will need five to six jabs a year, she said.</p>
    <p>Dr Oon said some peo­ple un­der­treat pso­ri­a­sis, par­tic­u­larly pso­ri­atic arthri­tis, as they feel that they should tol­er­ate the pain as well as swollen joints and wait and see. How­ever, the de­lay in treat­ment or sub-op­ti­mal ther­apy can lead to ero­sions and ir­re­versible joint de­struc­tion, she added.</p>
