    <p>The more things change, the more they re­main the same.</p>
    <p>That ap­pears to be true in the au­to­mo­tive in­dus­try to­day as car­mak­ers strug­gle with dif­fer­en­ti­at­ing mod­els and facelifts across a prod­uct range that is at least three times big­ger than, say, 30 years ago. And that strug­gle is be­com­ing more ap­par­ent with time.</p>
    <p>When I re­viewed the new Audi RS5 Sport­back in Septem­ber last year, I wrote: “On a day-to-day ba­sis... ac­cel­er­a­tion at any mo­ment and any speed is im­me­di­ate and lag-free – ac­com­pa­nied by a glo­ri­ous sound­track em­a­nat­ing from bazooka-size tailpipes – but it does not leave you breath­less.”</p>
    <p>That state­ment still ap­plies to the facelifted ver­sion re­viewed here be­cause there is no change to the per­for­mance spec­i­fi­ca­tions. The car has a 2.9-litre biturbo V6 mak­ing 450hp and 600Nm, pro­pel­ling the big­gest car to wear the RS badge to 100kmh in 3.9 sec­onds and a reg­u­lated top speed of 250kmh.</p>
    <p>Al­though Audi says the car has been tweaked to be more ag­gres­sive and edgier, it is not ap­par­ent.</p>
    <p>That does not di­min­ish the bril­liance of this quat­tro, though. The big­gish RS5 Sport­back is sharp and ag­ile around cor­ners, which is sur­pris­ing for a car with a rel­a­tively long 2,826mm wheel­base.</p>
    <p>This wheel­base ac­cords the car with a sem­blance of com­fort – both in terms of cabin space and ride qual­ity. Its sus­pen­sion is de­cid­edly firm but not jar­ring.</p>
    <p>Ex­te­ri­orly – ex­cept for ma­trix LED head­lights and new paint­work and rims – there is lit­tle to dis­tin­guish this car from the one I drove last year. Mi­nor tweaks to the grille and vents are hardly ap­par­ent.</p>
    <p>But in­side, you will find more no­tice­able changes. The car now comes with an RS mode switch. Like the mem­ory switch in BMW M cars, it lets you store two pre­set drive modes, which you can re­call in an in­stant to dis­patch that pesky hot hatch or road-hog­ging bus.</p>
    <p>And so you know ex­actly how quick you are, the RS now comes with a per­for­mance-ome­ter. Among other things, you can now clock your own quar­ter­mile sprint – with­out the help of an­other per­son. (Al­though for such an ex­er­cise, a look­out can be handy.)</p>
    <p>Be­ing an all-wheel-drive, the RS5 is sticky like pud­ding. An­tics which would have elicited wheel­spins in other cars are ex­e­cuted with calm.</p>
    <p>Per­haps a lit­tle too much calm.</p>
    <p>The shift pad­dles are new, too. And the car re­tains high-end com­forts such as mas­sage seats.</p>
    <p>But one thing with facelifts is that you tend to no­tice things you never did be­fore when the model was “all new”. In the RS5, th­ese in­clude a fake air-con­di­tion­ing</p>
    <p>vent on the pas­sen­ger side.</p>
    <p>The car’s in­te­rior gets very hot in the sun re­ally quickly (Note to Audi: Ap­ply so­lar coat­ing on glass), so the fake vent can be­come an is­sue. Ac­cord­ing to Audi, this stylis­tic non-func­tion­ing fea­ture is stan­dard is­sue in the A4 and A5 fam­ily.</p>
    <p>I sup­pose for a brand which has ar­guably the best de­signs among Ger­man makes, form is some­times as im­por­tant as func­tion. And you don’t nec­es­sar­ily want</p>
    <p>to change that.</p>
