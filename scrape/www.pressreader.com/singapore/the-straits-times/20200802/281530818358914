    <p>Firms in the con­struc­tion, marine ship­yard and process sec­tors badly hit by the coron­avirus cri­sis will get more help to de­fray their labour costs, with the Gov­ern­ment waiv­ing more months of the for­eign worker levy and giv­ing more levy re­bates.</p>
    <p>The Min­istry of Man­power (MOM), an­nounc­ing the ex­ten­sion of the support schemes yes­ter­day, said that $320 mil­lion will be set aside to cover the re­bates.</p>
    <p>This in­creased support is in ad­di­tion to the $1.36 bil­lion Con­struc­tion Support Pack­age an­nounced on June 27, and comes as the Gov­ern­ment works to clear all for­eign worker dor­mi­to­ries of the coron­avirus by Aug 7 so that work­ers can pro­gres­sively re­turn to work.</p>
    <p>Man­power Min­is­ter Josephine Teo said in a Face­book post yes­ter­day: “As we work to­wards es­tab­lish­ing safe liv­ing and work­ing con­di­tions for some de­gree of nor­malcy to re­turn, there have been chal­lenges and set­backs along the way.</p>
    <p>“It has been an enor­mous task for our of­fi­cers at the var­i­ous agen­cies, but these have been un­prece­dented times, and we are all adapt­ing and do­ing our best as the sit­u­a­tion evolves.”</p>
    <p>The ma­jor­ity of the 15,000 firms in the con­struc­tion, marine ship­yard and process sec­tors con­tinue to face fi­nan­cial dif­fi­cul­ties as they are un­able to re­sume work due to Covid-19 re­stric­tions, noted the MOM, adding that the sit­u­a­tion is likely to per­sist un­til all dor­mi­to­ries are cleared of the virus this month.</p>
    <p>With pay­ments tied to com­ple­tion mile­stones and high over­heads, cash flow has be­come a ma­jor con­cern for many firms, and the ex­ten­sion of the waiver and also levy re­bates is meant to “en­sure that these sec­tors re­tain en­ter­prise ca­pa­bil­i­ties to emerge stronger from the Covid-19 cri­sis”, said the MOM.</p>
    <p>As part of the For­ti­tude Bud­get pre­sented on May 26, all firms in the sec­tors re­ceived a full waiver of the for­eign worker levy due in June, and a 50 per cent waiver for the levy due last month.</p>
    <p>But now, the firms will get a full waiver for the levies due in July, Au­gust and Septem­ber.</p>
    <p>This will ta­per to 75 per cent for Oc­to­ber, 50 per cent for Novem­ber, and 25 per cent for De­cem­ber as the sec­tors restart and ac­tiv­ity picks up, said the MOM.</p>
    <p>Un­der the For­ti­tude Bud­get, the firms had also been given re­bates on the levy for each work per­mit or S Pass holder at $750 in June and $375 last month.</p>
    <p>With the ex­ten­sion, the $375 re­bate will be ex­tended for another two months to Au­gust and Septem­ber, re­plac­ing the orig­i­nal $90 re­bate for each work per­mit holder for both months. The $90 re­bate, which was meant to help the firms ad­just to safe man­age­ment mea­sures as they re­opened, will con­tinue from Oc­to­ber this year till De­cem­ber next year.</p>
    <p>Firms in the sec­tors said the levy waiver and re­bates would tide them over for a few more months, but noted they would have to restart projects within the next three months to en­sure sur­vival.</p>
    <p>Mr Lee Kay Chai, ex­ec­u­tive di­rec­tor of Lian Soon Con­struc­tion, said: “We need busi­ness to go back to nor­mal. If not, we are very de­pen­dent on the Gov­ern­ment to help us. Not many com­pa­nies can sus­tain them­selves as much of their re­serves have al­ready been used up from April to July.”</p>
    <p>Ac­knowl­edg­ing the chal­lenges faced by firms ad­just­ing to the chang­ing sit­u­a­tion on the ground and the var­i­ous ad­vi­sories by the au­thor­i­ties, Mrs Teo said: “Much as we want to speed things up, we have to be sure we do a thor­ough job, so that the sec­tor is not af­fected by another out­break.”</p>
    <p>She added: “The Gov­ern­ment re­mains com­mit­ted to help­ing the sec­tor as best as we can, within the lim­its of our re­sources.”</p>
    <p>Be­ing able to start work safely is what the firms are work­ing to­wards. Mr Si­mon Kuik, pres­i­dent of the As­so­ci­a­tion of Sin­ga­pore Marine In­dus­tries, said: “We can­not afford a sec­ond wave of out­break as this also means pro­longed busi­ness dis­rup­tion and ad­di­tional costs which com­pa­nies can­not sus­tain.”</p>
    <p>DO­ING OUR BEST</p>
    <p>As we work to­wards es­tab­lish­ing safe liv­ing and work­ing con­di­tions for some de­gree of nor­malcy to re­turn, there have been chal­lenges and set­backs along the way. It has been an enor­mous task for our of­fi­cers at the var­i­ous agen­cies, but these have been un­prece­dented times, and we are all adapt­ing and do­ing our best as the sit­u­a­tion evolves. ’’</p>
