    <p>More than half of the 67,000 ho­tel rooms in Sin­ga­pore are cur­rently be­ing used in the battle against Covid-19, Sin­ga­pore Tourism Board (STB) chief ex­ec­u­tive Keith Tan re­vealed on Tues­day.</p>
    <p>Their func­tions in­clude iso­la­tion and quar­an­tine fa­cil­i­ties, as well as ac­com­mo­da­tion for re­turn­ing res­i­dents serv­ing their 14-day stay-home no­tice, he told re­porters dur­ing a vir­tual brief­ing on plans for a $45 mil­lion do­mes­tic tourism cam­paign.</p>
    <p>While stay­ca­tions are a key fea­ture of the cam­paign, the ho­tel in­dus­try has not been given carte blanche to re­open, Mr Tan said.</p>
    <p>“The open­ing of ho­tels for stay­ca­tions has to be bal­anced against mak­ing sure that we have enough of a buf­fer of ho­tel rooms that are still re­quired, in case there’s any sub­se­quent surge of in­fec­tions.”</p>
    <p>Hence, ap­proval to re­sume op­er­a­tions has been done on a case-by­case ba­sis, he added.</p>
    <p>More than 100 ho­tels have sub­mit­ted pro­pos­als to re­open for stay­ca­tions since ap­pli­ca­tions opened at the start of the month, and about 80 have been given the green light to do so thus far, Mr Tan said.</p>
    <p>As of Mon­day, there were about 10,900 in­di­vid­u­als serv­ing stay­home no­tices at ho­tels, ac­cord­ing to fig­ures by the Health Min­istry.</p>
    <p>Apart from ho­tels, cruise ships, ex­hi­bi­tion cen­tres and chalets have also been used as iso­la­tion fa­cil­i­ties for re­cov­er­ing pa­tients with mild symp­toms or those await­ing swab test re­sults.</p>
    <p>While the num­ber of com­mu­nity cases has re­mained low with an av­er­age of 10 new cases a day over the past week, the au­thor­i­ties have warned that Sin­ga­pore should be pre­pared for a sec­ond wave of in­fec­tions, given its oc­cur­rence in a num­ber of other coun­tries.</p>
    <p>Mr Tan said there are no in­di­ca­tions of this hap­pen­ing here yet, adding that all mea­sures will be taken to pre­vent this, even as Sin­ga­pore re­opens its econ­omy and lo­cals are en­cour­aged to step out and sup­port busi­nesses.</p>
    <p>“All the gov­ern­ment agen­cies that are do­ing safe man­age­ment mea­sure en­force­ment, in­clud­ing STB, will con­tinue to have a very high level of checks and en­force­ment,” he said, adding that hy­giene and safety mea­sures will be key to the cam­paign.</p>
    <p>RE­OPEN­ING ON CASE-BY-CASE BA­SIS</p>
    <p>The open­ing of ho­tels for stay­ca­tions has to be bal­anced against mak­ing sure that we have enough of a buf­fer of ho­tel rooms that are still re­quired, in case there’s any sub­se­quent surge</p>
    <p>’’ of in­fec­tions.</p>
    <p>MR KEITH TAN, chief ex­ec­u­tive of the Sin­ga­pore Tourism Board, who says that while stay­ca­tions are a key fea­ture of the tourism cam­paign, the ho­tel in­dus­try has not been given carte blanche to re­open.</p>
