    <p>Like other ath­letes in Sin­ga­pore, Net­ball Su­per League club Swifts Bar­racu­das were re­lieved when the re­stric­tions to stem the spread of Covid-19 were eased in June, al­low­ing them to gather in groups of five to train.</p>
    <p>How­ever, safe dis­tanc­ing mea­sures re­main in play for al­most all as­pects of lo­cal sport, and with that, sev­eral sports teams are now rack­ing up in­creased costs.</p>
    <p>For the Bar­racu­das, ex­penses have dou­bled as the club have to book an ad­di­tional court for 20 play­ers to train twice a week at the Kal­lang Net­ball Cen­tre, said coach Geral­dine Ng.</p>
    <p>Only five play­ers are al­lowed on one court at any one time. The team have had to halve train­ing time to just one hour to ac­com­mo­date more play­ers for each two-hour book­ing.</p>
    <p>The Bar­racu­das use club funds con­trib­uted by mem­bers to cover costs, said Ng, 28, who has been coach­ing the team for three years.</p>
    <p>When asked how they have adapted their train­ing to fit the ar­range­ments, she said: “We build up from small group drills to large group drills in a typ­i­cal train­ing ses­sion.</p>
    <p>“With Covid-19 re­stric­tions, we can stick only to small group drills. The dif­fi­culty comes in when we want to ap­ply spe­cific skills and con­cepts we prac­tised to ac­tual court sit­u­a­tions”.</p>
    <p>Old­ham Hockey Club pres­i­dent Christa­bel Chan and her team­mates have also had to change the way they train.</p>
    <p>The club’s usual train­ing venue, the Min­istry of Ed­u­ca­tion (MOE) Evans hockey pitch, re­mains closed, and so they now train at the Ac­tiveSG Hockey Vil­lage in Boon Lay, which is a third the size of a reg­u­lar hockey pitch.</p>
    <p>The pitch at Delta Sport Cen­tre is un­der ren­o­va­tion and it is dif­fi­cult for Chan to book pitches at the Sengkang hockey fa­cil­ity as these are used by the na­tional teams.</p>
    <p>To abide by safe dis­tanc­ing guide­lines, the pitch at Boon Lay is split into quad­rants, with five play­ers in each sec­tion.</p>
    <p>“It’s a bit trou­ble­some be­cause if one ball crosses to other quad­rants, we can’t cross over to take it,” said Chan, 27, who has been play­ing hockey for 18 years.</p>
    <p>“But it’s un­der­stand­able why these reg­u­la­tions are in place and we just have to be un­der­stand­ing dur­ing these times.</p>
    <p>“You don’t get to play the sport you love but there are other ways to bond with your team and play the sport on a smaller scale too.”</p>
    <p>The lack of avail­able train­ing venues is also a prob­lem faced by floor­ball club Black Won­der­sticks, who used to train ev­ery Satur­day at Dual-Use Scheme sports fa­cil­i­ties in schools like Nan Chiau Pri­mary School.</p>
    <p>The scheme has been sus­pended by Sport Sin­ga­pore and MOE since March 25 and the club’s men’s, women’s and ju­nior teams now train at the Sin­ga­pore Univer­sity of Tech­nol­ogy and De­sign (SUTD).</p>
    <p>Teams now train only twice a month with SUTD al­low­ing only cor­po­rate book­ings, which cost two times more than in­di­vid­ual book­ings of Dual-Use Scheme fa­cil­i­ties, said Black Won­der­sticks gen­eral man­ager No­rani Zaini.</p>
    <p>The teams train in groups of five, with the groups spaced three me­tres apart and no in­ter­min­gling al­lowed.</p>
    <p>Drills are also more fo­cused on im­prov­ing tech­nique and move­ment in­stead of game play.</p>
    <p>No­rani, who also owns the Youth Floor­ball Academy, said: “It’s a bit frus­trat­ing be­cause of the safety mea­sures and change of struc­ture to train­ing.</p>
    <p>“We miss game time also but we must do our best to max­imise train­ing so that ev­ery­one con­tin­ues im­prov­ing their skills...</p>
    <p>“We just have to keep mo­ti­vat­ing our play­ers to main­tain the dy­namic of the team and have a good train­ing reg­i­men for them.”</p>
