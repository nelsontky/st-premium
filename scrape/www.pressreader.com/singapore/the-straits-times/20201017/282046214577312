    <p>In a bid to help the com­mu­nity care work­force stay rel­e­vant amid the Covid-19 pan­demic, the num­ber of train­ing places of­fered will in­crease by 20 per cent to pro­vide greater ac­cess to op­por­tu­ni­ties in the sec­tor.</p>
    <p>The Agency for In­te­grated Care (AIC) will ap­point two ad­di­tional learn­ing in­sti­tutes – Alzheimer’s Dis­ease As­so­ci­a­tion and Tan Tock Seng Hospital – to the AIC Learn­ing Net­work from next Jan­uary, said Se­nior Min­is­ter of State for Health Koh Poh Koon.</p>
    <p>With the ad­di­tion, the net­work will have eight learn­ing in­sti­tutes pro­vid­ing about 11,000 train­ing places a year for the next four years.</p>
    <p>“In a time of change, the com­mu­nity care work­force needs to be fu­ture-ready. Ev­ery com­mu­nity care staff will need to be open to con­tin­u­ous learn­ing and skills up­grad­ing so that you re­main equipped with rel­e­vant skills to care for our se­niors,” said Dr Koh.</p>
    <p>He was speak­ing yes­ter­day at a virtual awards cer­e­mony where about 100 in­di­vid­u­als re­ceived the Com­mu­nity Care Man­power De­vel­op­ment Awards (CCMDA).</p>
    <p>Re­cip­i­ents of the awards will be able to at­tend var­i­ous train­ing pro­grammes free. They will be co­funded by CCMDA and their hir­ing com­mu­nity care providers.</p>
    <p>CCMDA will also make fund­ing avail­able to providers to hire tem­po­rary staff to cover the du­ties of staff pur­su­ing a full-time course.</p>
    <p>The scheme cov­ers all lev­els of skills up­grad­ing, from the Na­tional In­sti­tute of Tech­ni­cal Ed­u­ca­tion Cer­tifi­cate to master’s de­grees in a range of clinical and non-clinical ar­eas.</p>
    <p>It also cov­ers pro­fes­sional de­vel­op­ment cour­ses and at­tach­ments to lo­cal or over­seas health­care and com­mu­nity care fa­cil­i­ties.</p>
    <p>Re­cip­i­ents will have to ful­fil a bond with their hir­ing com­mu­nity care providers upon grad­u­a­tion.</p>
    <p>AIC said the awards “aim to en­able th­ese in­di­vid­u­als to de­velop and up­grade them­selves pro­fes­sion­ally, so as to make a deeper im­pact on se­niors to help them live and age grace­fully in the com­mu­nity”.</p>
    <p>Dr Koh cited the ex­am­ple of Mr Den­nis Oen, a pro­gramme man­ager at Thye Hua Kwan Moral Char­i­ties. Mr Oen, who was an op­er­a­tions man­ager at his fam­ily busi­ness, made a mid-ca­reer switch to the com­mu­nity care sec­tor in 2018.</p>
    <p>He took a course on pro­vid­ing ser­vice ex­cel­lence in health­care un­der the AIC Learn­ing Net­work that year. Un­der the CCMDA, he has since gone on to pur­sue a part-time master’s pro­gramme in geron­tol­ogy – a field of study that deals with age­ing-re­lated is­sues – at the Sin­ga­pore Uni­ver­sity of So­cial Sciences.</p>
    <p>Said Dr Koh: “As the com­mu­nity care sec­tor trans­forms, I en­cour­age you to con­tinue to learn, and muster the courage to step out­side your com­fort zone so that you can keep pace with a rapidly evolv­ing com­mu­nity care l and­scape and con­tinue to de­liver good care to our se­niors.”</p>
    <p>Since the CCMDA was launched in 2017, more than 380 awards have been given out. The ma­jor­ity of re­cip­i­ents are cur­rent staff in the com­mu­nity care sec­tor.</p>
    <p>About 15 per cent of re­cip­i­ents are new en­trants to the sec­tor and are en­rolled in a range of cour­ses such as nurs­ing, phys­io­ther­apy and oc­cu­pa­tional ther­apy.</p>
