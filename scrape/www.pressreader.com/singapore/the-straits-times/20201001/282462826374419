    <p>• He­len Reddy, the Aus­tralia-born singer whose 1972 hit song I Am Woman be­came the fem­i­nist an­them of the decade and pro­pelled her to in­ter­na­tional pop-mu­sic star­dom, died on Tues­day in Los An­ge­les. She was 78.</p>
    <p>The death was con­firmed by her chil­dren in a message posted on her of­fi­cial fan page on Face­book. She suf­fered for decades from Ad­di­son’s dis­ease (she had a kid­ney re­moved when she was 17) and since at least 2015, from de­men­tia.</p>
    <p>I Am Woman reached No. 1 on the Bill­board charts at the end of 1972 – a good six months af­ter it was re­leased. In­di­vid­ual call-in re­quests helped build ra­dio play and the song earned her a Grammy Award for best fe­male pop vo­cal per­for­mance.</p>
    <p>She was the first Aus­tralia-born artist to win a Grammy and make the Bill­board 100 record charts. Some male ob­servers called the song – be­gin­ning with the words “I am woman/Hear me roar/In num­bers/ Too big to ig­nore,” sung by a 1.6m tall so­prano – an­gry, man-hat­ing, dan­ger­ous or all three.</p>
    <p>“That sim­ply un­der­lined the many things women needed lib­er­at­ing from,” a writer for Va­ri­ety re­flected last year. “No­body called Si­na­tra a men­ace when he sang My Way, a no less straight­for­ward hymn to self­de­ter­mi­na­tion.”</p>
    <p>Dur­ing the 1970s, three of Reddy’s songs – in­clud­ing Delta Dawn and Angie Baby – went to No. 1 on the Bill­board chart. Three oth­ers – Ain’t No Way To Treat A Lady, You and Me Against The World and Leave Me Alone (Ruby Red Dress) – made the Top 10.</p>
    <p>More than three decades later, The Chicago Tri­bune de­clared her the “queen of ’70s pop”.</p>
    <p>He­len Maxine Lamond Reddy was born on Oct 25, 1941, in Mel­bourne, the only child of Max Reddy, a writer, pro­ducer and ac­tor; and Stella (Lamond) Reddy, an ac­tress whose stage name was Stella Camp­bell. Her fa­ther was in New Guinea, serv­ing in the Aus­tralian army, when she was born.</p>
    <p>The Red­dys per­formed on the Aus­tralian vaude­ville cir­cuit and He­len be­gan join­ing them on stage when she was four. At 12, she re­belled by quit­ting show busi­ness and go­ing to live with an aunt while her par­ents toured.</p>
    <p>But her fi­nan­cial sit­u­a­tion – af­ter an early mar­riage, par­ent­hood and di­vorce – per­suaded her to re­turn. She had a solid rep­u­ta­tion in Aus­tralian tele­vi­sion and ra­dio when she won a 1966 tal­ent con­test spon­sored by Band­stand, a Syd­ney pop-mu­sic tele­vi­sion show. The prize was a trip to New York City and a record-com­pany au­di­tion there.</p>
    <p>The au­di­tion did not pan out and her ca­reer got off to a slow, dis­cour­ag­ing start. Be­fore Capi­tol Records signed her in 1970, at least 27 record la­bels re­jected her, and she and her new hus­band, Jeff Wald, who was now her man­ager, moved – first to Chicago, then to Los An­ge­les.</p>
    <p>Times were hard, es­pe­cially when the cou­ple lived in New York. In The Woman I Am: A Mem­oir (2006), she wrote: “When we did eat, it was spaghetti, and we spent what lit­tle money we had on cock­roach spray.”</p>
    <p>Her first hit was a 1971 cover of I Don’t Know How To Love Him, a hit from the award-win­ning stage show Je­sus Christ Su­per­star. The suc­cess of I Am Woman, with Reddy’s lyrics and Ray Bur­ton’s mu­sic, came a year later.</p>
    <p>She was a fre­quent guest in the early 1970s on va­ri­ety, mu­sic and talk shows such as The Mike Dou­glas Show, The Carol Bur­nett Show, The David Frost Show, The Merv Grif­fin Show and The Glen Camp­bell Good­time Hour. The He­len Reddy Show (1973) was an eightepiso­de sum­mer re­place­ment se­ries on NBC.</p>
    <p>She made her big-screen de­but in the disas­ter movie Air­port 1975 (1974) as a gui­tar-play­ing nun who com­forts a sick lit­tle girl (Linda Blair) on an al­most cer­tainly doomed 747. She al­ways liked to point out that Glo­ria Swan­son and Myrna Loy were also in the cast.</p>
    <p>That was fol­lowed by a star­ring role in the Dis­ney movie Pete’s Dragon (1977) as a scep­ti­cal New Eng­land light­house keeper who doubts an or­phaned boy’s sto­ries about his an­i­mated fire-breath­ing pet.</p>
    <p>Reddy’s Broad­way ca­reer con­sisted of re­plac­ing the lead in Blood Broth­ers, a mu­si­cal set in Liver­pool, for a few months in 1995. But she had a busy stage ca­reer else­where, star­ring in pro­duc­tions of Any­thing Goes, Call Me Madam and Shirley Valen­tine in Eng­land and in the United States, from Province­town to Sacra­mento.</p>
    <p>Her last song to make the Amer­i­can charts was I Can’t Say Goodbye To You (1981) and Imag­i­na­tion (1983) was her last al­bum. Her fi­nal screen ap­pear­ance was in The Per­fect Host (2010), a crime com­edy with David Hyde Pierce.</p>
    <p>Reddy mar­ried and di­vorced three times. In 1961, she mar­ried Ken­neth Claude Weate, an older mu­si­cian who was a fam­ily friend. They had a daugh­ter and di­vorced in 1966.</p>
    <p>In 1968, she mar­ried Wald, and they had a son. They sep­a­rated in 1981, when he checked into a treat­ment facil­ity for co­caine ad­dic­tion, and di­vorced two years later. That same year, she mar­ried Mil­ton Ruth, a drum­mer in her band. They di­vorced in 1995.</p>
    <p>Sur­vivors in­clude her two chil­dren, Traci Wald Do­nat, the daugh­ter from her first mar­riage, and Jor­dan Som­mers, the son from her sec­ond; her half-sis­ter, Toni Lamond, an Aus­tralian singer-ac­tress; and a grand­child.</p>
