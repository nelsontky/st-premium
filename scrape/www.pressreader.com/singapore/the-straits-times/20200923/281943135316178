    <p>WASH­ING­TON • The team led by spe­cial coun­sel Robert Mueller failed to do ev­ery­thing it could to de­ter­mine what hap­pened in the 2016 elec­tion, shy­ing away from steps like sub­poe­naing US Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump and scru­ti­n­is­ing his fi­nances out of fear he would fire them, one of Mr Mueller’s top lieu­tenants has ar­gued in a new book.</p>
    <p>“Had we used all avail­able tools to un­cover the truth, un­de­terred by the on­slaught of the pres­i­dent’s unique pow­ers to un­der­mine our ef­forts?” wrote for­mer pros­e­cu­tor An­drew Weiss­mann in the first insider ac­count of the in­quiry.</p>
    <p>“I know the hard an­swer to that sim­ple ques­tion: We could have done more,” he added.</p>
    <p>The team took elab­o­rate steps to pro­tect its files of ev­i­dence from the risk that the Jus­tice Depart­ment might de­stroy them if Mr Trump fired them and worked to keep re­porters and the pub­lic from learn­ing what they were up to, Mr Weiss­mann wrote in Where Law Ends: In­side The Mueller In­ves­ti­ga­tion, which Ran­dom House will pub­lish next week.</p>
    <p>While he speaks rev­er­ently of Mr Mueller, Mr Weiss­mann also says his boss’ dif­fi­dence made him ill­suited for as­pects of shep­herd­ing the po­lit­i­cally charged in­quiry.</p>
    <p>He also crit­i­cised Mr Trump as “law­less” and de­fended him­self against ac­cu­sa­tions by the Pres­i­dent and his al­lies that he and other in­ves­ti­ga­tors were po­lit­i­cally bi­ased “an­gry Democrats”; Mr Weiss­mann said his per­sonal views had no bear­ing on the crimes that Rus­sian op­er­a­tives and Trump aides com­mit­ted.</p>
    <p>And he el­e­vates par­tic­u­lar de­tails – for ex­am­ple, em­pha­sis­ing that the same busi­ness ac­count that sent hush pay­ments to an adult film star who al­leged an ex­tra­mar­i­tal af­fair with Mr Trump had also re­ceived “pay­ments linked to a Rus­sian oli­garch”.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump has de­nied the af­fair; his for­mer lawyer Michael Co­hen con­trolled the ac­count.</p>
    <p>Mr Weiss­mann ran one of three ma­jor units for the spe­cial coun­sel’s of­fice. His “Team M” pros­e­cuted Mr Trump’s for­mer cam­paign chair­man Paul Manafort for nu­mer­ous fi­nan­cial crimes. The goal was to flip him and learn what­ever he knew about any Trump cam­paign links to Rus­sia.</p>
    <p>Manafort had worked for proRus­sian in­ter­ests in Ukraine, and the in­ves­ti­ga­tion un­cov­ered ties by his busi­ness part­ner, Kon­stantin Kil­imnik, to Rus­sian in­tel­li­gence.</p>
    <p>“We would have sub­poe­naed the pres­i­dent af­ter he re­fused our ac­com­mo­da­tions, even if that risked us be­ing fired,” wrote Mr Weiss­mann.</p>
    <p>“It just didn’t sit right. We were left feel­ing like we had let down the Amer­i­can pub­lic, who were count­ing on us to give it our all.”</p>
