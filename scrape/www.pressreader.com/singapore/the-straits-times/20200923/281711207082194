    <p>A grant that helps Sin­ga­pore­ans and per­ma­nent res­i­dents who have lost their jobs or suffered sig­nif­i­cant in­come loss due to the pan­demic will be ex­tended to the end of this year, but with re­vised el­i­gi­bil­ity cri­te­ria.</p>
    <p>From Oct 1, those ap­ply­ing for the Covid-19 Sup­port Grant (CSG) should also not own more than one prop­erty.</p>
    <p>This is to en­sure that the sup­port is given to those with less means, said the Min­istry of So­cial and Fam­ily Devel­op­ment (MSF) yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>All those who are un­em­ployed and are ap­ply­ing for the CSG must also demon­strate job search or train­ing ef­forts to qual­ify for the help, added MSF in a state­ment.</p>
    <p>The min­istry said the Gov­ern­ment’s SGUnited Jobs and Skills Pack­age helps work­ers af­fected by the eco­nomic im­pact of the pan­demic ac­quire job-re­lated skills and ca­pa­bil­i­ties and ac­cess ex­panded em­ploy­ment op­por­tu­ni­ties.</p>
    <p>“In line with these ef­forts, all CSG ap­pli­cants, whether first- or sec­ond-time ap­pli­cants, who are un­em­ployed must demon­strate job search or train­ing ef­forts to qual­ify for CSG sup­port,” said MSF.</p>
    <p>The CSG, which pro­vides up to $800 a month for three months, sup­ports Sin­ga­porean and per­ma­nent res­i­dent full- or part-time em­ploy­ees who have lost their jobs, have been placed on in­vol­un­tary no-pay leave or have sus­tained sig­nif­i­cant salary loss be­cause of the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>The CSG started in May, and ap­pli­ca­tions for the grant were ini­tially due to close af­ter Sept 30.</p>
    <p>But last month, Deputy Prime Min­is­ter and Fi­nance Min­is­ter Heng Swee Keat an­nounced that the grant will be ex­tended un­til Dec 31. At that point, more than $90 mil­lion had been dis­bursed to over 60,000 res­i­dents un­der the CSG.</p>
    <p>In its up­date yes­ter­day, MSF said: “First-time ap­pli­cants who meet the cur­rent el­i­gi­bil­ity cri­te­ria may con­tinue to ap­ply for CSG un­til 6pm on Sept 30.</p>
    <p>“The re­vised el­i­gi­bil­ity cri­te­ria will take ef­fect from 9am on Oct 1,” it added.</p>
    <p>Those who have al­ready re­ceived the full CSG grant, or are in the fi­nal month of as­sis­tance, may ap­ply for an ad­di­tional three months of sup­port from Oct 1.</p>
    <p>In­di­vid­u­als can ap­ply on­line at go.gov.sg/CSG</p>
