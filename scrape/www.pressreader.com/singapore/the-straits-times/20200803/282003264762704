    <p>To pay trib­ute to front-line and es­sen­tial work­ers giv­ing their all amid the Covid-19 pan­demic, six F-15 fighter jets will be soar­ing over the heart­land as part of this year’s Na­tional Day Pa­rade (NDP).</p>
    <p>The fighter jets will be per­form­ing the Roar Of Unity, a 30-minute seg­ment that will see the planes cover the is­land, so that the pub­lic will be able to see and hear them from their homes.</p>
    <p>The well-loved aerial dis­play will make its en­trance at 10.45am this Sun­day at the Padang, where the morn­ing pa­rade will take place.</p>
    <p>Fly­ing in a tight Delta for­ma­tion, which is shaped like an ar­row­head, they will fly past eight hos­pi­tals – Tan Tock Seng Hos­pi­tal, Sengkang Gen­eral Hos­pi­tal, Changi Gen­eral Hos­pi­tal, Khoo Teck Puat Hos­pi­tal, Ng Teng Fong Gen­eral Hos­pi­tal, Na­tional Univer­sity Hos­pi­tal, Alexan­dra Hos­pi­tal and Sin­ga­pore Gen­eral Hos­pi­tal. They will then make three passes around the heart­land be­fore re­turn­ing to Paya Le­bar Air Base at around 11.15am.</p>
    <p>“The Roar Of Unity sig­ni­fies the nation is re­main­ing united as we cel­e­brate Na­tional Day,” said Lieu­tenant-Colonel Tan Boon Hong, 46, who is deputy chair­man of air par­tic­i­pa­tion and fly­ing dis­play mar­shal. “We want to give trib­ute to our front-line fight­ers and es­sen­tial work­ers that keep us go­ing dur­ing this pe­riod and we salute them for their re­silience, ded­i­ca­tion and sac­ri­fice.”</p>
    <p>At 170 nau­ti­cal miles, this will be the long­est route ever for a fighter jet seg­ment dur­ing a Na­tional Day cel­e­bra­tion, as the fly-past is usu­ally lo­calised to where the pa­rade is, such as the Padang.</p>
    <p>It is a spe­cial seg­ment for Lieu­tenant Shi­dan Swah Yepeng, 26, who is tak­ing part in his first NDP and is the youngest pi­lot in the for­ma­tion.</p>
    <p>He will be pay­ing par­tic­u­lar trib­ute to his par­ents, both 58 and stal­warts in the health­care in­dus­try for more than 30 years each.</p>
    <p>His fa­ther is a se­nior con­sul­tant at a poly­clinic, while his mother is sec­onded from the Na­tional Health­care Group to the Sin­ga­pore Nurs­ing Board as an ex­ec­u­tive sec­re­tary. They were also in­volved in the fight against se­vere acute res­pi­ra­tory syn­drome in 2003.</p>
    <p>“It’s quite mean­ing­ful to me that I’m able to over­fly (Tan Tock Seng Hos­pi­tal),” said Lt Swah, who has fond child­hood mem­o­ries of ac­com­pa­ny­ing his mother to the hos­pi­tal where she spent much of her ca­reer.</p>
    <p>It will also be the first time in an NDP for weapon sys­tems of­fi­cer (fighter) Adam Eng Jun Chao, 29.</p>
    <p>One of the chal­lenges of this year’s route is its length, said Cap­tain Eng, as it re­quires a lot of con­cen­tra­tion and fi­nesse to be ma­noeu­vring at such fast speeds and in close prox­im­ity to the other planes.</p>
    <p>There is about a 2m to 3m gap be­tween the wingtips of each plane in the Delta for­ma­tion as they fly at close to 600kmh.</p>
    <p>An­other chal­lenge is bad weather. Cpt Eng said: “Weather will com­pro­mise the in­tegrity of the six-ship Delta for­ma­tion... (it) kind of plays with your senses be­cause you are then not able to vis­ually see where the hori­zon is.”</p>
    <p>The jets will be fly­ing at a height of 457m to 610m, though there is a buf­fer of 152m to 762m in case of ad­verse weather.</p>
    <p>Main­tain­ing smooth con­trol of the airspace above Sin­ga­pore is also key, as the fighter jets will be shar­ing the airspace with the six heli­copters that will be fly­ing the state flag around.</p>
    <p>Cap­tain Daniel Heng Jing Xing, 26, will be in the team help­ing with con­trol of the airspace as an air traf­fic con­troller.</p>
    <p>He said: “Our role as the main con­troller is to ob­tain the airspaces (in a timely man­ner) so that once we have the airspace, our fight­ers can op­er­ate safely through­out.”</p>
