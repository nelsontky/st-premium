    <p>FAIRPRICE FINEST LE QUEST</p>
    <p>This su­per­mar­ket opened on Nov 19 and its snack game is strong.</p>
    <p>Bags of Oreo and But­terfin­ger pop­corn tempt me, and you can pick up munchies from Amazin’ Graze and The Golden Duck Co pack­aged for Christ­mas.</p>
    <p>Good presents in­clude Kind Bags, made from re­cy­cled plas­tic bot­tles, and eco-friendly clean­ing prod­ucts from Soap­nut Repub­lic.</p>
    <p>Cus­tomers can pick their veg­eta­bles and have them cut, or the trays of pre-cut veg­eta­bles to make cook­ing fuss-free. They can also or­der gro­ceries on­line and pick up at the store.</p>
    <p>Where: 4 Bukit Ba­tok Street 41, 01-91/92, open: 8am to 11pm daily</p>
    <p>1. Lilo Pre­mium fish and mush­room pow­ders</p>
    <p>I am very de­lighted to find these flavour boost­ers from Lilo, a Sin­ga­pore com­pany. They are not cheap, but these pow­ders are made with just the in­gre­di­ent stated on the pouch and noth­ing else – no preser­va­tives, no MSG.</p>
    <p>They make good sub­sti­tutes for salt. Use them to add piz­zazz to con­gee, soup, stir-fries, stews and pretty much every­thing else.</p>
    <p>The Shi­itake Mush­room Pow­der ($25 for a 55g pouch) deep­ens the flavour of meat­balls when you add it to minced pork. Both the Ikan Bilis ($15 for a 55g pouch) and White Bait ($18 for a 55g pouch) ones would be ex­cel­lent added to con­gee, or to flavour popiah filling.</p>
    <p>The best one is the Scal­lop Pow­der ($35 for a 55g pouch), which tastes so lux­u­ri­ous, I want to sprin­kle it like fairy dust on every­thing I eat.</p>
    <p>3. De­li­ciously Ella Crunchy Buck­wheat Gra­nola ($17.95 for a 425g box)</p>
    <p>This Bri­tish brand of ce­real seems ter­ri­bly earnest, tick­ing all the po­lit­i­cally cor­rect boxes – be­ing plant-based and all.</p>
    <p>I pick up a box of Crunchy Buck­wheat Gra­nola mainly be­cause I have never had buck­wheat ce­real. And now, I’m a con­vert. The prod­uct de­liv­ers on the prom­ise on the box – it is very crunchy.</p>
    <p>More im­por­tantly, it is not too sweet. You know how gra­nola can some­times be quite shock­ingly so? Here, oats are baked with date syrup and orange juice, then mixed with roasted buck­wheat, puffed brown rice, pump­kin and sun­flower seeds, raisins and co­conut chips.</p>
    <p>Have it with milk. But if you’re lac­tose-in­tol­er­ant, the su­per­mar­ket has lots of plant-based al­ter­na­tives.</p>
    <p>POSH NOSH X FAIRPRICE FINEST CHRIST­MAS GIFT BOX</p>
    <p>If you are still stumped for presents, here’s some­thing your friends and fam­ily might en­joy – a box of lit­tle treats I put to­gether with FairPrice Finest. In­side, you’ll find:</p>
    <p>The Ket­tle Gourmet Nasi</p>
    <p>Le­mak Pop­corn: Tastes re­mark­ably like the dish; love the co­conut and chilli vibes.</p>
    <p>Ooh Mala Cas­sava Chips: Usu­ally I’m a chilli cow­ard, but I find my­self reach­ing into the bag again and again.</p>
    <p>Kind Dark Choco­late Bark: What’s Christ­mas with­out choco­late? I love the crunch of these not-too-sweet treats. Hook Cof­fee Sweet Bund­chen Drip Bags: In a food coma? Perk up with this cof­fee, with nutty, milk choco­late notes.</p>
    <p>Jeal­ous Sweets Su­gar Free Happy Bears: Guilt-free! When you have overindulg­ed but still need a treat.</p>
    <p>Dal Colle Panet­tone: A baby panet­tone for French toast or to go with cheese and pate.</p>
    <p>• Buy the box in any FairPrice Finest su­per­mar­ket for $45 each while stocks last. The usual price is $49.15 and there are 500 boxes avail­able.</p>
    <p>2. Nanyang Sauce chilli sauces ($9.90 for a 225ml jar)</p>
    <p>I use Nanyang’s light and dark soya sauces for cook­ing, and like the qual­ity of this Sin­ga­pore com­pany’s prod­ucts. And now, it has added great chilli sauces to its range.</p>
    <p>The Sam­bal Prawn Chilli Sauce is not head-ex­plod­ingly spicy but has a good bite, and is filled with dried shrimp.</p>
    <p>Even bet­ter is the Nonya Chilli Sauce, fra­grant with lemon­grass. Both are ver­sa­tile. You can have them along­side fried fish, use them as a dip for dim­sum or fried chicken, or sim­ply eat them with hot rice.</p>
    <p>4. Pro­tein Bakeshop truf­fles ($7.95 for a 60g box)</p>
    <p>If you’re look­ing for lux­ury choco­late truf­fles, the deca­dent kind, this is not for you.</p>
    <p>Pro­tein Bakeshop, a com­pany head­quar­tered in Dubai, makes truf­fles for peo­ple look­ing for a pro­tein boost. I would stash these in­di­vid­u­ally wrapped balls in my bag for when I need that.</p>
    <p>There’s a slew of flavours avail­able, but the one that tastes the best is the Cashew Caramel. None of them are very sweet.</p>
    <p>The Dark Choco­late and Peanut But­ter ones have rather dry, pow­dery cen­tres. But the cashew tastes al­most deca­dent. And it’s just 83 calories for each ball.</p>
