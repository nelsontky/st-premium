    <p>Ride-hail­ing op­er­a­tor Grab and gam­ing hard­ware maker Razer’s re­cently dis­closed data breaches could not have come at a worse time for the two dig­i­tal bank hope­fuls.</p>
    <p>The firms are among ap­pli­cants be­ing con­sid­ered by the Mon­e­tary Author­ity of Sin­ga­pore (MAS) for up to five dig­i­tal bank li­cences to be is­sued by the end of this year.</p>
    <p>In a LinkedIn post ear­lier this month, cy­ber-se­cu­rity con­sul­tant Volodymyr Di­achenko es­ti­mated that around 100,000 global cus­tomers of Razer could have had their per­sonal data leaked on­line due to a mis­con­fig­ured sys­tem.</p>
    <p>The er­ror al­lowed de­tails of cus­tomers’ re­cent or­ders, e-mails, phone num­bers and billing and ship­ping ad­dresses, among other records, to be searched on the In­ter­net for three weeks from Aug 18 this year.</p>
    <p>In a state­ment last week, Razer ac­knowl­edged the prob­lem but did not con­firm the num­ber of af­fected cus­tomers. It also said that the sys­tem er­ror was fixed on Sept 9, a day be­fore the lapse was made pub­lic, and that cus­tomers’ credit card num­bers and pass­words were not ex­posed.</p>
    <p>Grab’s track record is far from stel­lar, with the firm hav­ing been sanc­tioned four times in two years for sim­i­larly fail­ing to pro­tect per­sonal data un­der its con­trol. In all these in­stances, it vi­o­lated Sec­tion 24 of the Per­sonal Data Pro­tec­tion Act (PDPA).</p>
    <p>The MAS told The Straits Times it “will con­sider all rel­e­vant in­for­ma­tion that has bear­ing on the as­sess­ment of the ap­pli­cants” in grant­ing the dig­i­tal bank li­cences.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to its web­site, a firm’s rep­u­ta­tion, track record, reg­u­la­tory com­pli­ance and risk man­age­ment plans are among the things con­sid­ered.</p>
    <p>So the ride-hail­ing firm’s re­peated breaches and Razer’s data se­cu­rity over­sight beg the ques­tion: Are the two home-grown tech firms ready to par­tic­i­pate in Sin­ga­pore’s march to­wards a dig­i­tal econ­omy where data is the new cur­rency?</p>
    <p>Also, are the cur­rent penal­ties too light for firms that may be en­trusted with crit­i­cal in­for­ma­tion?</p>
    <p>TRACK RECORD</p>
    <p>Un­der the law, firms are re­quired to have “rea­son­able se­cu­rity ar­range­ments” to prevent per­sonal data from be­ing col­lected, ac­cessed, used or dis­closed with­out con­sent.</p>
    <p>In Oc­to­ber 2018, Grab was fined $6,000 by Sin­ga­pore’s pri­vacy watch­dog, the Per­sonal Data Pro­tec­tion Com­mis­sion (PDPC), for fail­ing to se­cure a Google Form con­tain­ing the names, mo­bile phone num­bers and NRIC num­bers of 20 sus­pended GrabHitch driv­ers such that all 20 of them could see one an­other’s per­sonal de­tails.</p>
    <p>Just un­der a year later in June last year, it was fined $16,000 for dis­clos­ing the names and mo­bile phone num­bers of 120,747 cus­tomers in mar­ket­ing e-mails to un­in­tended re­cip­i­ents.</p>
    <p>The ride-hail­ing firm was also di­rected that same month to tighten mea­sures to prevent GrabHitch driv­ers from mis­han­dling the per­sonal data of their rid­ers – al­though the firm was not fined.</p>
    <p>Most re­cently last week, Grab was fined $10,000 for fail­ing to se­cure the pro­file pic­tures, names and pick-up and drop-off lo­ca­tions of 21,541 driv­ers and pas­sen­gers on its mo­bile app.</p>
    <p>A $10,000 fine for the fourth breach in two years seems like a slap on the wrist and sends the wrong sig­nal about data se­cu­rity, say crit­ics.</p>
    <p>Fines for data breaches are cur­rently capped at $1 mil­lion; the high­est fine was slapped col­lec­tively once on In­te­grated Health In­for­ma­tion Sys­tems and SingHealth in Jan­uary last year for ex­pos­ing the per­sonal data of more than 1.5 mil­lion SingHealth patients.</p>
    <p>Cy­ber-se­cu­rity ex­pert Henry Hu, the chief tech­nol­ogy of­fi­cer of Lon­don’s Cen­tre for Strate­gic Cy­berspace + In­ter­na­tional Stud­ies, said Grab’s fine, com­par­a­tively, is “small change that does not even in­stil fear or a sense of guilt”.</p>
    <p>But ex­perts gen­er­ally agree that Grab’s four vi­o­la­tions are dis­crete in­ci­dents and are not as se­ri­ous as SingHealth’s mas­sive breach.</p>
    <p>How­ever, Mr Kevin Shep­herd­son, chief ex­ec­u­tive of­fi­cer of Sin­ga­pore-based data pro­tec­tion spe­cial­ist Straits In­ter­ac­tive, said that a wrongly con­fig­ured server as in the re­cent Razer in­ci­dent will not be tol­er­ated.</p>
    <p>Leaked pur­chase de­tails, names, con­tact in­for­ma­tion and de­liv­ery ad­dresses of Razer cus­tomers can do sig­nif­i­cant dam­age. Hack­ers could im­per­son­ate Razer em­ploy­ees to trick cus­tomers into giv­ing up pass­words or trans­fer­ring money dig­i­tally.</p>
    <p>Up­com­ing re­vi­sions to the PDPA will give the au­thor­i­ties a larger stick to go af­ter of­fend­ers.</p>
    <p>Un­der pro­posed changes to be tabled in Par­lia­ment later this year, fines for data breaches could go up to 10 per cent of the gross an­nual turnover of an or­gan­i­sa­tion’s busi­ness in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>Tech­nol­ogy lawyer Gil­bert Leong, a se­nior part­ner at Den­tons Rodyk & Davidson, said: “The larger fine will make all rep­utable com­pa­nies sit up.”</p>
    <p>While the theft of lo­cally is­sued credit and debit card de­tails from com­pro­mised e-com­merce web­sites has led to the re­peated sale of these card de­tails on the dark Web, none of these leaks was due to se­cu­rity fail­ings by lo­cal banks.</p>
    <p>Data leaks, mas­sive or not, should not be taken lightly, es­pe­cially since Grab and Razer al­ready man­age dig­i­tal cur­ren­cies.</p>
    <p>The MAS re­quires fi­nan­cial in­sti­tu­tions in Sin­ga­pore to have strict con­trols to prevent unau­tho­rised data dis­clo­sure. This same pair of lens will be used on dig­i­tal banks.</p>
    <p>Tech­nol­ogy lawyer Jonathan Kok, a part­ner at Withers Khat­tar Wong, said: “Razer and Grab need to prove to the MAS that they have a sep­a­rate, more ro­bust and se­cure sys­tem for dig­i­tal bank­ing.”</p>
