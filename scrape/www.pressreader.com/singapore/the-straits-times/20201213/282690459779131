    <p>The 12.12 sales frenzy yes­ter­day took on a whole new mean­ing for op­er­a­tions man­ager Ja­son Ng this year.</p>
    <p>Mr Ng, 48, joined e-com­merce lo­gis­tics provider J&T Ex­press Sin­ga­pore only in Oc­to­ber so he had lit­tle time to ad­just to a faster-paced – and younger – en­vi­ron­ment.</p>
    <p>He had spent all 24 years of his work­ing life in the tra­di­tional lo­gis­tics in­dus­try deal­ing with heavy equip­ment and spare parts, which were mostly not needed ur­gently.</p>
    <p>Now, he han­dles any­thing from wal­lets to di­a­pers, plan­ning the man­power and ma­chin­ery to be used for each or­der to be picked up, packed, sorted and de­liv­ered. Dif­fer­ent-sized pack­ages re­quire dif­fer­ent treat­ment.</p>
    <p>“I like the daily chal­lenge – we have to en­sure the prod­ucts cus­tomers buy reach them the next day and reach them safely,” he said.</p>
    <p>“Also my col­leagues are young peo­ple, which makes me feel happy be­cause I also feel young.”</p>
    <p>Mr Ng had con­cluded that ca­reer prospects were bet­ter in ecom­merce lo­gis­tics and left his pre­vi­ous op­er­a­tions man­age­ment role in Oc­to­ber af­ter land­ing his new job with sim­i­lar pay.</p>
    <p>“See­ing as the e-com­merce in­dus­try is com­ing up and the trends in lo­gis­tics will be chang­ing, I wanted to give my­self a chance to learn more about how this new in­dus­try works,” he added.</p>
    <p>Although Mr Ng was con­cerned that his age might be a bar­rier in his job search, he told him­self that</p>
    <p>his ex­pe­ri­ence in lo­gis­tics would al­low him to show his em­ployer in the in­ter­view that he can progress. He ended up land­ing a po­si­tion af­ter a month-long search.</p>
    <p>The fa­ther of three school-aged chil­dren said he feels blessed that his wife and kids gave him their full sup­port in his ca­reer switch.</p>
    <p>Mr Ng, who has a busi­ness de­gree, first be­came in­ter­ested in ecom­merce about three years ago and used his Skill­sFu­ture Credit to pick up new skills in Face­book Mar­ket­place and on­line sell­ing.</p>
    <p>What he learnt has been use­ful in his new job as he can bet­ter un­der­stand the in­dus­try and cus­tomers, he said, adding that he hopes to at­tend more cour­ses to hone his peo­ple man­age­ment skills.</p>
    <p>His boss, the firm’s op­er­a­tions di­rec­tor, also pro­vides a lot of guid­ance and men­tor­ship, which help him as he man­ages a new team.</p>
    <p>Mr Ng said he was happy to find that the com­pany spon­sors train­ing cour­ses for staff even if not di­rectly re­lated to their job.</p>
    <p>“They be­lieve if we grow, we can con­trib­ute to the com­pany with a pos­i­tive mind­set.”</p>
