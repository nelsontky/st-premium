    <p>NEW YORK • In a sign that Amer­i­cans are be­com­ing less hes­i­tant to take a Covid-19 vac­cine, a Gallup poll re­leased on Tues­day showed that 58 per cent of adults sur­veyed were will­ing to be vac­ci­nated, up from 50 per cent in Septem­ber.</p>
    <p>The sur­vey was con­ducted be­tween Oct 19 and Nov 1, as coro­n­avirus cases surged across the coun­try, but be­fore Pfizer and Moderna an­nounced that their vac­cines were about 90 per cent ef­fec­tive against the virus in late-stage tri­als.</p>
    <p>The re­sults are promis­ing for an even­tual vac­cine roll-out, as wide­spread in­oc­u­la­tion against the virus is seen as es­sen­tial be­fore life can re­turn to some nor­malcy.</p>
    <p>The sur­vey’s au­thors warned, how­ever, that con­fi­dence in a vac­cine re­mained lower than it was ear­lier in the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>In June, for in­stance, Gallup re­ported that 66 per cent of Amer­i­cans said they would be vac­ci­nated.</p>
    <p>While the per­cent­age of Amer­i­can adults who said they would not be vac­ci­nated dropped to 42 per cent from 50 per cent in Septem­ber, scep­ti­cism about a rushed vac­cine, among other fac­tors, still presents a sig­nif­i­cant chal­lenge.</p>
    <p>“A longer pe­riod of de­vel­op­ment and clin­i­cal test­ing” may help ame­lio­rate some of the most com­mon rea­sons for con­cern, the poll’s au­thors wrote.</p>
    <p>Dr Phoebe Danziger, a pae­di­a­tri­cian at the Univer­sity of Michi­gan, said the Gallup data was con­sis­tent with what she had ob­served. “Clearly, there’s a lot of hes­i­ta­tion out there, but it seems like there’s a slight shift into a pos­i­tive view,” she said, adding that Amer­i­cans across the po­lit­i­cal spec­trum are start­ing to see that they are “re­ally go­ing to need this to get out of this mess”.</p>
    <p>The poll, which sur­veyed 2,985 adults, has a mar­gin of er­ror of plus or mi­nus 3 per­cent­age points.</p>
    <p>The in­creased will­ing­ness to take a Covid-19 vac­cine was more pro­nounced i n cer­tain groups, par­tic­u­larly Democrats and Amer­i­cans be­tween the ages of 45 and 64. Among Democrats, will­ing­ness rose to 69 per cent last month from 53 per cent in Septem­ber.</p>
    <p>Nearly half of Amer­i­cans be­tween the ages of 45 and 64 – 49 per cent – said they were will­ing to take a vac­cine, up from 36 per cent in Septem­ber.</p>
    <p>De­spite the in­crease, peo­ple in that age group re­mained least likely to say they would do so.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, the United States ap­proved the first Covid-19 di­ag­nos­tic kit for self-test­ing at home, adding one more tool to bat­tle the pan­demic as na­tion­wide test­ing ca­pa­bil­i­ties come un­der more strain.</p>
    <p>The Food and Drug Ad­min­is­tra­tion (FDA) is­sued an emer­gency-use au­tho­ri­sa­tion to Lu­cira Health’s rapid-re­sult All-In­One Test Kit, the gov­ern­ment agency said on Tues­day.</p>
    <p>While some Covid-19 tests al­low peo­ple to pro­vide sam­ples from home, this is the first test that can be fully self-ad­min­is­tered and can pro­vide re­sults at home in 30 min­utes or less.</p>
    <p>FDA com­mis­sioner Stephen Hahn said: “This new test­ing op­tion is an im­por­tant di­ag­nos­tic ad­vance­ment to ad­dress the pan­demic and re­duce the public bur­den of dis­ease trans­mis­sion.”</p>
