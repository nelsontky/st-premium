    <p>The au­thor­i­ties take very se­ri­ously the judge’s com­ments on the case of for­mer do­mes­tic worker Parti Liyani – who was ac­quit­ted of steal­ing from Changi Air­port Group chair­man Liew Mun Leong and his fam­ily – and will deal with what had gone wrong in the process, said Home Af­fairs and Law Min­is­ter K. Shan­mugam.</p>
    <p>“Some­thing has gone wrong in the chain of events. We have to look at that, and deal with what went wrong,” he said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>“In the process, we should not be de­fen­sive. It should not be a witch hunt. It has got to be a fair process. We have to find out what hap­pened, why it hap­pened, and then deal with it. And be ac­count­able.</p>
    <p>“That is the best way to build trust (with the) pub­lic and in the sys­tem. To come out in pub­lic and say what steps we have taken once the re­views are done,” said Mr Shan­mugam, who was speak­ing to re­porters vir­tu­ally on the side­lines of a grass­roots event.</p>
    <p>He was asked for his com­ments on the case, which had sparked a pub­lic out­cry.</p>
    <p>Ms Parti, 46, who worked for the Liew fam­ily from 2007 to 2016, was ac­cused of steal­ing over $34,000 worth of items from them. Af­ter a trial in the State Courts, she was found guilty on four counts of theft and sen­tenced to two years and two months in jail in March last year. She ap­pealed to the High Court against her con­vic­tion and sen­tence, and was ac­quit­ted last Fri­day.</p>
    <p>The At­tor­ney-Gen­eral’s Cham­bers (AGC), po­lice and Min­istry of Man­power have said they are re­view­ing the judg­ment to see whether fur­ther ac­tion has to be taken as a re­sult of the judg­ment.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, Mr Shan­mugam cau­tioned against pre­judg­ing what part of the process had gone wrong. “That is why re­views are be­ing con­ducted. We should wait for the out­come,” he said.</p>
    <p>The case also led some to ques­tion whether the class and sta­tus dif­fer­ences be­tween Ms Parti and the Liews had con­trib­uted to un­fair­ness in the way the case was han­dled. Asked about this, Mr Shan­mugam said it is good to see jus­tice de­liv­ered, based on the High Court’s judg­ment. How­ever, he stressed that the jus­tice sys­tem is im­par­tial to all and fair, and the sta­tus and po­si­tion of the par­ties in­volved does not mat­ter.</p>
    <p>Not­ing that Ms Parti was charged in a crim­i­nal case based on a com­plaint by a very prom­i­nent busi­ness per­son, he added: “The judge’s judg­ment goes through the facts very care­fully. It sets out what the break in the chain of ev­i­dence is, and in that way, it is good to see that jus­tice is both blind and that jus­tice has been de­liv­ered.”</p>
    <p>He also com­mended Ms Parti’s lawyer, Mr Anil Balchan­dani, who acted pro bono. He said that though he has not read Mr Balchan­dani’s sub­mis­sions, he was told the lawyer had picked up on var­i­ous in­con­sis­ten­cies in the ev­i­dence and why his client ought not to be con­victed.</p>
    <p>“He did a thor­ough and good job of it. That is a lawyer’s job. To be thor­ough, to be clear, to put for­ward ev­ery­thing fairly to the court,” said Mr Shan­mugam. “Based on what I have heard, I think he ought to be com­mended.”</p>
    <p>Jus­tice Chan Seng Onn, in his 100-page judg­ment on the case, found the trial judge’s con­vic­tion against Ms Parti to be un­safe.</p>
    <p>He cited the han­dling of the ev­i­dence by the po­lice, the record­ing of the al­legedly stolen items and the im­proper mo­tive be­hind the al­le­ga­tions of some fam­ily mem­bers.</p>
    <p>The AGC said on Sun­day that it will study Jus­tice Chan’s judg­ment to assess what fur­ther ac­tion, if any, ought to be taken in this case.</p>
    <p>The po­lice also said they would be look­ing into sev­eral ob­ser­va­tions on po­lice in­ves­ti­ga­tions made by Jus­tice Chan.</p>
    <p>The judge had found a break in the chain of cus­tody of ev­i­dence, and this cre­ated rea­son­able doubt as to whether some of the al­legedly stolen items dis­cov­ered by the fam­ily were ac­cu­rately doc­u­mented by the pho­to­graphs taken by the po­lice some five weeks later.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing this pe­riod, the fam­ily were also told by the po­lice that they were free to use the items. They took and put back items into the boxes, but it was not clear if the items that were put back were the same ones re­moved ear­lier.</p>
    <p>Jus­tice Chan also found that two state­ments were taken from Ms Parti with­out an in­ter­preter.</p>
