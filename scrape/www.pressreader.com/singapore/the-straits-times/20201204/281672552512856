    <p>Malaysia’s op­po­si­tion leader An­war Ibrahim is un­likely to lose his po­si­tion be­cause of his fail­ure yes­ter­day to meet a self-im­posed seven-day dead­line to top­ple Prime Min­is­ter Muhyid­din Yassin.</p>
    <p>Not only is there a lack of an al­ter­na­tive within Datuk Seri An­war’s Pakatan Hara­pan (PH) coali­tion, but former Sabah chief min­is­ter Shafie Ap­dal – the top con­tender to re­place him as op­po­si­tion leader and de facto prime min­is­ter can­di­date – hurt his prospects by or­der­ing his Parti Warisan Sabah to ab­stain from vot­ing in the on­go­ing Bud­get 2021 de­bate.</p>
    <p>Of­fi­cial sources told The Straits Times that Datuk Seri Shafie’s renom­i­na­tion for the role rests on whether his back­ers in PH – which has 91 MPs, while Warisan, one of sev­eral in­de­pen­dent op­po­si­tion par­ties, has only eight – can con­vince their col­leagues that the former Umno vice-pres­i­dent is wor­thy.</p>
    <p>Ear­lier this year, he was mooted as a com­pro­mise can­di­date when the op­po­si­tion was at log­ger­heads over whether to pick Mr An­war or former prime min­is­ter Ma­hathir Mo­hamad to lead them. The ef­fort, how­ever, ul­ti­mately failed.</p>
    <p>“The (Warisan) boy­cott will cause trou­ble for those who want to put for­ward Shafie’s name,” a PH law­maker told The Straits Times. “This gives An­war an ex­cuse as he can say Warisan sab­o­taged him.”</p>
    <p>In a sur­prise move, Mr An­war told op­po­si­tion MPs not to call for a di­vi­sion in Par­lia­ment last week, al­low­ing the Perikatan Na­sional (PN) gov­ern­ment to pass the bud­get on its sec­ond read­ing by a sim­ple voice vote.</p>
    <p>There is wide­spread spec­u­la­tion that Mr An­war, who is Parti Kead­i­lan Rakyat (PKR) pres­i­dent, backed away from a show of hands so that Tan Sri Muhyid­din could not prove his ma­jor­ity in a cru­cial Sup­ply Bill af­ter po­ten­tial de­fec­tions from Umno – a key com­po­nent in PN – failed to ma­te­ri­alise.</p>
    <p>Con­fronted by the 90 other PH leg­is­la­tors over the bud­get de­ba­cle, Mr An­war, who is Port Dick­son MP, asked for seven days to prove he could muster a par­lia­men­tary</p>
    <p>ma­jor­ity, fail­ing which he said he would re­sign from the lead­er­ship of the coali­tion and the op­po­si­tion bloc in Par­lia­ment, PH law­mak­ers told The Straits Times.</p>
    <p>But at the end of yes­ter­day’s de­bate for the on­go­ing com­mit­tee stage of Bud­get 2021, PN – which con­trols only 112 seats in the 220-strong Par­lia­ment – has been able to se­cure ap­proval for ev­ery in­di­vid­ual min­istry’s al­lo­ca­tion so far, even though Mr An­war has since Septem­ber claimed to have a “strong, for­mi­da­ble and con­vinc­ing” ma­jor­ity of MPs.</p>
    <p>Warisan has been ab­sent from Par­lia­ment for all ex­cept one vote this week, in protest against Mr An­war’s last-minute in­struc­tion not to call for a bloc vote at</p>
    <p>the sec­ond read­ing of the bud­get Bill on Nov 26. Grass­roots mem­bers and op­po­si­tion sup­port­ers lam­basted the move for pri­ori­tis­ing po­lit­i­cal machi­na­tions in­stead of pub­lic in­ter­est.</p>
    <p>A top Warisan leader said seven of its MPs had to vote against the in­ter­na­tional trade and in­dus­try al­lo­ca­tion yes­ter­day, as fel­low Saba­han Wil­fred Tan­gau, who is United Pro­gres­sive Kinabalu Or­gan­i­sa­tion pres­i­dent, moved for RM20 mil­lion (S$6.57 mil­lion) to be trans­ferred to the Sabah Tech­nol­ogy Park.</p>
    <p>The Warisan leader added: “We have to sup­port any mo­tion that is ben­e­fi­cial to Sabah, but oth­er­wise, our stand is not to sup­port An­war’s strat­egy, which is to</p>
    <p>work with Umno only to be­come prime min­is­ter, rather than to en­sure a bet­ter bud­get or gov­ern­ment for Malaysia.”</p>
    <p>Warisan’s party whip Roz­man Isli was quoted by the Malaysi­akini news por­tal as say­ing that the ab­sten­tion was to “make sure ev­ery­body in the op­po­si­tion starts to re­alise there is a need for a strong lead­er­ship in the op­po­si­tion bloc”, and sug­gested new lead­er­ship from younger per­son­al­i­ties with­out stat­ing spe­cific names. Mr Shafie is 10 years younger than Mr An­war, who is 73.</p>
    <p>But PH fig­ures have lashed out at Warisan for re­fus­ing to back ef­forts to de­feat the gov­ern­ment’s bud­get, ac­cus­ing the party of seek­ing revenge against Mr An­war.</p>
    <p>PKR Sabah i nfor­ma­tion chief Sim­sudin Sidek said: “I call on the Warisan lead­er­ship to cease this un­rea­son­able ac­tion and re­mind them to be­have like true friends.”</p>
    <p>Of­fi­cial sources told The Straits Times Mr An­war is be­ing given more time by his coali­tion part­ners, and some be­lieve this will drag on un­til Bud­get 2021’s fi­nal vote at the third read­ing on Dec 15.</p>
