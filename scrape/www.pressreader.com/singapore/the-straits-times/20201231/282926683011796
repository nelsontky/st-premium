    <p>Model and cook­book au­thor Chrissy Teigen has never been shy about dis­cussing her per­sonal life on so­cial me­dia and her lat­est rev­e­la­tion is that she is four weeks sober – and count­ing.</p>
    <p>She had shared a com­i­cal-yet­sexy video on In­sta­gram on Tues­day of her gy­rat­ing i n a swim­suit dur­ing a fam­ily Christ­mas hol­i­day in Saint Barts.</p>
    <p>Teigen said she was “four weeks sober” and added heart and prayer-hand emo­jis.</p>
    <p>The out­spo­ken Amer­i­can, who has two young chil­dren with singer John Le­gend, had pre­vi­ously men­tioned her strug­gles with al­co­hol.</p>
    <p>“I was, point blank, just drink­ing too much,” she told Cos­mopoli­tan mag­a­zine in a 2017 in­ter­view and said she was tak­ing a break from al­co­hol at the time.</p>
    <p>She went on to say she has a his­tory of al­co­hol abuse in her fam­ily and is a per­son who “can’t just have one drink”.</p>
    <p>She had con­sid­ered quit­ting for good at least a cou­ple of times over the years.</p>
    <p>“I used to think it was kind of nutty to have to go to­tally sober,” she said. “But now, I get it. I don’t want to be that per­son. I have to fix my­self.”</p>
    <p>In ad­di­tion to go­ing sober, she also announced to her le­gions of fol­low­ers on Twit­ter that she is im­ple­ment­ing a new year’s res­o­lu­tion re­gard­ing so­cial me­dia.</p>
    <p>“For years I have been con­sumed by the over­whelm­ing need to ex­plain why I’m do­ing what I’m do­ing, why I did why I did. No more,” she wrote.</p>
    <p>In the past year, she has shared deeply per­sonal sto­ries, such as when she had her breast im­plants re­moved in June, as well as the heart­break­ing still­birth of her third child in Septem­ber.</p>
    <p>How­ever, her open­ness has of­ten been met with toxic on­line abuse and ha­rass­ment.</p>
