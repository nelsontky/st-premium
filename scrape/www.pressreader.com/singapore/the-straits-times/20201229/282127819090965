    <p>More than 70 cu­rated cour­ses for job seek­ers hop­ing to up­skill and reskill can now be browsed on a sin­gle web­site.</p>
    <p>The ma­jor­ity of the cour­ses on train­ing mar­ket­place FastLearn are Skill­sFu­ture Credit-el­i­gi­ble, and many also qual­ify for ad­di­tional sub­si­dies and gov­ern­ment sup­port such as train­ing al­lowances, job por­tal FastJobs said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The train­ing por­tal also guides job seek­ers who are not in pro­fes­sional, man­age­rial, ex­ec­u­tive and tech­ni­cian (PMET) roles on which cour­ses are most suit­able for them.</p>
    <p>Course providers in­clude in­sti­tutes of higher learn­ing such as poly­tech­nics, and pri­vate train­ing providers like Shatec.</p>
    <p>FastJobs said it had worked closely with Skill­sFu­ture Sin­ga­pore since last month to cu­rate cour­ses to help those in nonPMET roles level up their skills.</p>
    <p>In­dus­tries cov­ered in­clude cus­tomer ser­vice, food and bev­er­age, re­tail, health­care and other op­er­a­tional and cus­tomer-fac­ing sec­tors. Course op­tions will over time be ex­panded and up­dated to cater to the grow­ing in­ter­est in skills up­grad­ing, said FastJobs.</p>
    <p>For Madam Zafi­rah Mo­hamad</p>
    <p>Sinna, the FastLearn plat­form is an op­por­tu­nity to gain new skills that are market-rel­e­vant.</p>
    <p>The 32-year-old house­wife, who has a two-year-old daugh­ter and a three-year-old son, is look­ing to re-en­ter the job market.</p>
    <p>“I am look­ing to up­grade my­self for of­fice work. I have en­rolled in a course on of­fice ad­min­is­tra­tion as I don’t have the nec­es­sary ex­pe­ri­ence and I’m hop­ing to get an of­fice job,” she said.</p>
    <p>More than 300,000 ac­tive job ap­pli­cants use the FastJobs plat­form each month, while 500 job seek­ers have reg­is­tered their in­ter­est in cour­ses listed on FastLearn over the past month, said a spokesman.</p>
    <p>FastJobs was in­cu­bated by Sin­ga­pore Press Hold­ings and of­fi­cially launched in 2015. The job-match­ing mo­bile app has been down­loaded more than 2.5 mil­lion times by users in the re­gion, said FastJobs.</p>
