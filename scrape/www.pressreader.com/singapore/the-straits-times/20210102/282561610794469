    <p>He, now 36, can still see his pass thread its way 20 yards through a crowded field.</p>
    <p>Can still rec­ol­lect its flaw­less ge­om­e­try as it ar­rived at the striker’s feet who scored.</p>
    <p>Jon has no video of that pass and his only wit­nesses would rather not hear his story again, but he has what most am­a­teur ath­letes have. The price­less­ness of mem­ory.</p>
    <p>Jon can’t for­get the af­ter­noon he was Xavi. For three un­for­get­table sec­onds of his ath­let­i­cally chal­lenged life my col­league was a foot­ball sa­vant. Re­ally. Just ask him and he’ll tell you in de­light­edly ex­cru­ci­at­ing de­tail of a pass he made 18 years ago on a con­crete court in Bukit Timah.</p>
    <p>He, now 36, can still see his pass thread its way 20 yards through a crowded field. Can still rec­ol­lect its flaw­less ge­om­e­try as it ar­rived at the striker’s feet who scored.</p>
    <p>Jon has no video of that pass and his only wit­nesses would rather not hear his story again, but he has what most am­a­teur ath­letes have. The price­less­ness of mem­ory.</p>
    <p>Mem­ory in sport is not just of what you have seen, but of what you did, last week at 53 or 20 years ago in a lane, a park, a school. A re­trieved smash, a re­flex save, an 8m putt or a morning when you floated across the earth like Eliud Kip­choge. Mem­ory that runs in your head like a slow mo­tion film.</p>
    <p>These are mem­o­ries un­stained by time and clutched onto with grate­ful­ness and al­most ev­ery am­a­teur has one. Forty years ago, Salma, now 66, had a mo­ment of kin­ship with a horse called Windy and it left an im­print in her brain.</p>
    <p>“I was able to stay on the horse in a trot or can­ter, but it was a lot of work. Then one day, it all came to­gether and we did a per­fect round over jumps! It was like we shifted gear, from me try­ing to con­trol the horse to both of us know­ing what to do and do­ing it to­gether as part­ners.”</p>
    <p>Ten min­utes later, with­out me hav­ing asked for it, she sends me a pho­to­graph which she keeps in her bed­room. Her arms are around Windy’s head, her face is bliss­ful.</p>
    <p>This talk about mem­ory be­gins be­cause Jon alerts me to a Guardian pod­cast on foot­ball where the chat­ter among the speak­ers shifts from deeds in sta­di­ums to rec­ol­lec­tions of a first boy­ish try and an only headed goal.</p>
    <p>It is wist­ful, funny, per­sonal and yet so re­lat­able. This is the am­a­teur ath­lete’s con­nec­tive tis­sue, these sto­ries held in the head, some se­cretly and oth­ers told at boozy lunches. In time a 10m putt turns into a 13m one, but em­broi­dery is part of the am­a­teur code.</p>
    <p>The over-the-shoul­der flick of the shut­tle for a win­ner, a piece of magic the am­a­teur has waited a life­time for, is not archived on YouTube nor in a li­brary, yet it is unerasable. Mem­ory is van­ity but also val­i­da­tion.</p>
    <p>One friend, Pradeep, never a drib­bling artist, is still be­wil­dered by a day when he cut through a crowd with the ball af­fixed like a mag­net to his hockey stick. As he tells the story, 42 years ago turns into yes­ter­day. “I can still feel the shock now. To me it was a glimpse of what I could do. If I believed.”</p>
    <p>The pro­fes­sional has a suit­case of mem­o­ries and a home clut­tered with mem­o­ra­bilia. Choos­ing a mo­ment can take a while. Best goal, Cris­tiano? Hmm. Great­est chip-in, Phil? Let’s see now. Ama­teurs have fewer moments but they hold them like trea­sure.</p>
    <p>Al­most ev­ery one I asked had a mean­ing­ful mem­ory. Xinyi of a ta­ble ten­nis point at 14 which un­folded like a car­bon copy of the im­age she had vi­su­alised in her head. Javed of a goal-line save at 11. “It de­luded me,” he says, “into think­ing I had a fu­ture in sport.”</p>
    <p>Some­times, the am­a­teur thinks, if I had prac­tised harder, maybe – as Mar­lon Brando tells his brother in On The Wa­ter­front – “I coulda been a con­tender, I coulda been some­body” but of course not. Sport is only al­low­ing you a rare brush­stroke, not a ca­reer in art.</p>
    <p>High achieve­ment is a rel­a­tive idea. For Maradona it was a 60m drib­ble in a World Cup, for you a last-minute goal in a park game.</p>
    <p>All it tells you is that you can do it. Not con­sis­tently like a pro­fes­sional, not on com­mand like a cham­pion, but just do it once. Peo­ple will tell you it’s a fluke, but ama­teurs tell them­selves this is what we play sport for. For this fleet­ing taste of some­thing vaguely beau­ti­ful in a life­time of lousy per­for­mances.</p>
    <p>How do you ever for­get that? A first kiss, a job in­ter­view nailed, a ride up the Eif­fel Tower, so many pieces of life stay with you. But what you did as an am­a­teur on a field one morning also re­mains in the over-crowded mem­ory, for per­haps noth­ing else gave you per­mis­sion to madly high-five paunchy golf­ing pals or run around a field in some for­giv­ably fan­tas­tic delir­ium.</p>
    <p>This week we moved to Phase 3 and more peo­ple are al­lowed on a bas­ket­ball court and sport is stretch­ing its arms a lit­tle. Off we go again, driven by joy, win­ning, sweat, com­pet­i­tive­ness but also by mem­ory. Those we wish to make again and those we hold on to.</p>
    <p>Jon’s knees have been re­paired three times and he hasn’t kicked a foot­ball for five years. He’s on the bench but in his mem­ory he still runs. I don’t know if he’s ever read John Banville’s The Sea, but there’s a line in it he’d like. “The past beats in­side me like a se­cond heart.”</p>
    <p>So, for Jon, does that pass.</p>
