    <p>HONG KONG A Hong Kong web­site that pub­lishes ma­te­rial mainly re­lated to anti-gov­ern­ment protests in 2019 said its users’ ac­cess had been blocked by the city’s In­ter­net ser­vice providers (ISPs).</p>
    <p>The web­site, HKChron­i­cles, said it be­gan re­ceiv­ing re­ports from Hong Kong-based users say­ing they could no longer ac­cess the site from last Wed­nes­day evening.</p>
    <p>“After dis­cussing and in­ves­ti­gat­ing with our sup­port­ers, we found that some ISPs of Hong Kong have de­lib­er­ately dropped any con­nec­tion to our servers, so that the user could not re­ceive replies from our servers, re­sult­ing in an in­abil­ity to ac­cess our con­tent,” chief edi­tor Naomi Chan said in a state­ment.</p>
    <p>The South China Morn­ing Post, cit­ing un­named sources, said yes­ter­day that Hong Kong po­lice had in­voked the city’s na­tional se­cu­rity law for the first time to block HKChron­i­cles, and that the po­lice had started ask­ing ISPs to halt ac­cess, cit­ing Ar­ti­cle 43 of the law.</p>
    <p>The po­lice said they can­not com­ment on in­di­vid­ual cases. The city’s gov­ern­ment did not im­me­di­ately re­spond to a re­quest for com­ment.</p>
    <p>Un­der the leg­is­la­tion im­posed on Hong Kong last June, the po­lice can re­quest ser­vice providers to re­strict ac­cess to elec­tronic plat­forms or mes­sages that could pose a threat to na­tional se­cu­rity.</p>
    <p>HKChron­i­cles said that based on users’ re­ports, the ISPs sus­pected of be­ing in­volved in the block­ing com­prised SmarTone, China Mo­bile Hong Kong, PCCW and oth­ers. It did not elab­o­rate. China Mo­bile, SmarTone, and PCCW did not re­spond to re­quests for com­ment.</p>
    <p>The se­cu­rity law pun­ishes what China broadly de­fines as se­ces­sion, sub­ver­sion, ter­ror­ism and col­lu­sion with for­eign forces with up to life in jail.</p>
    <p>The Hong Kong and Bei­jing gov­ern­ments say it is vi­tal to plug holes in na­tional se­cu­rity de­fences ex­posed by months of some­times vi­o­lent anti-gov­ern­ment and an­tiChina protests that rocked the global fi­nan­cial hub in 2019.</p>
    <p>The Hong Kong po­lice ar­rested 53 peo­ple in dawn raids on democ­racy ac­tivists last Wed­nes­day, in the big­gest crack­down since China im­posed the se­cu­rity law.</p>
    <p>“I think right now many users are be­ing af­fected, but few web­sites are be­ing af­fected. It seems like it’s a tech­nol­ogy test, to test the in­flu­ence of block­ing web­sites to the en­tire Hong Kong net­work,” said Ms Chan.</p>
