    <p>Re­li­gious or­gan­i­sa­tions will be al­lowed to con­duct sev­enth month prayer ser­vices with up to 50 peo­ple at a time from Aug 19 to Sept 16.</p>
    <p>The cap of 50 peo­ple ex­cludes re­li­gious and sup­port­ing work­ers, the Min­istry of Cul­ture, Com­mu­nity and Youth (MCCY) said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>How­ever, singing and other live per­for­mances such as getai will not be per­mit­ted, though wor­ship­pers can burn in­cense and joss pa­per within the premises.</p>
    <p>The min­istry’s ad­vi­sory was de­vel­oped in con­sul­ta­tion with the Sin­ga­pore Bud­dhist Fed­er­a­tion and the Taoist Fed­er­a­tion.</p>
    <p>Re­li­gious or­gan­i­sa­tions must sub­mit safe man­age­ment plans at least three days be­fore they plan to start sev­enth month prayer ser­vices.</p>
    <p>These should in­clude en­sur­ing devo­tees ob­serve a 1m safe dis­tance when wor­ship­ping in­di­vid­u­ally or in groups of no more than five, and keep­ing wor­ship ser­vices as short as pos­si­ble. Face masks must be worn at all times, while re­li­gious lead­ers may wear a face shield when per­form­ing speak­ing du­ties.</p>
    <p>Places of wor­ship with re­duced air cir­cu­la­tion such as en­closed prayer spa­ces should, where pos­si­ble, open doors and win­dows to nat­u­rally ven­ti­late the space af­ter use.</p>
    <p>No re­cep­tions or on-site meals are al­lowed be­fore or af­ter the ser­vice but or­gan­i­sa­tions can dis­trib­ute take­away meals, pre-packed sta­ple food items and prayer pack­ages to wor­ship­pers.</p>
    <p>Other con­gre­ga­tional and wor­ship ser­vices are al­lowed to take place con­cur­rently, but these are sub­ject to a cap of 50 peo­ple.</p>
    <p>Vis­its to colum­baria in places of wor­ship are also al­lowed if the colum­baria have been per­mit­ted to operate in phase two, sub­ject to a cap of 50 peo­ple. Safe dis­tanc­ing rules ap­ply.</p>
    <p>Non-con­gre­ga­tional re­li­gious ac­tiv­i­ties such as re­li­gious rites, pas­toral ser­vices and re­li­gious classes can also be con­ducted con­cur­rently for groups of up to five peo­ple, sub­ject to a cap of 50 peo­ple.</p>
    <p>These ac­tiv­i­ties must be con­ducted at sep­a­rate lo­ca­tions within the place of wor­ship, and there must be ad­e­quate signs to guide peo­ple such that they do not in­ter­act while en­ter­ing, leav­ing or while on the premises.</p>
    <p>MCCY also said sev­enth month prayers can take place in venues out­side of places of wor­ship, such as Hous­ing Board com­mon ar­eas and in­dus­trial ar­eas.</p>
    <p>This ap­plies to re­li­gious or­gan­i­sa­tions that have sub­mit­ted their safe man­age­ment plans for phase two ac­tiv­i­ties, but they must still ob­tain per­mits and ap­provals from the premise own­ers and the rel­e­vant au­thor­i­ties.</p>
    <p>Re­fer­ring to the sev­enth month ac­tiv­i­ties, Ven­er­a­ble Kwang Phing, pres­i­dent of the Sin­ga­pore Bud­dhist Fed­er­a­tion, said: “Ul­lam­bana Fes­ti­val may take place dif­fer­ently this year, but this does not lessen the sig­nif­i­cance of the fes­ti­val. Wor­ship­pers can still ex­press their fil­ial piety, in a safe and re­spon­si­ble man­ner... to pro­tect them­selves and oth­ers.”</p>
    <p>Mr Tan Thiam Lye, chair­man of the Taoist Fed­er­a­tion, said it would do its best to meet the re­li­gious needs of the Taoist com­mu­nity, while work­ing closely with the rel­e­vant au­thor­i­ties.</p>
