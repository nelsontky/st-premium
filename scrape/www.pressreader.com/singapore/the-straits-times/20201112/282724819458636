    <p>The fes­ti­val suc­ceeded in ques­tion­ing in­ci­sively what it means to con­nect to oth­ers in this pan­demic</p>
    <p>The Covid-19 pan­demic has tested the ver­sa­til­ity of arts fes­ti­vals ev­ery­where, driv­ing most on­line.</p>
    <p>The 23rd Sin­ga­pore Writ­ers Fes­ti­val (SWF), or­gan­ised by the Na­tional Arts Coun­cil from Oct 30 to last Sun­day, has been no ex­cep­tion.</p>
    <p>But, re­worked to re­volve around the theme of in­ti­macy, it suc­ceeded in ques­tion­ing keenly and in­ci­sively what it means to con­nect to oth­ers in this time.</p>
    <p>Helmed by poet Pooja Nansi – who jug­gled di­rec­to­rial du­ties with giv­ing birth to her daugh­ter three weeks ago – SWF brought on board a record 10 head­lin­ers, in­clud­ing vet­eran writ­ers such as Mar­garet At­wood, 80, and Sharon Olds, 77, who might not have ac­qui­esced so read­ily to a long-haul flight for a phys­i­cal fes­ti­val.</p>
    <p>A plethora of dig­i­tal com­mis­sions, from phone calls to vir­tual ex­hi­bi­tions, had vary­ing de­grees of success.</p>
    <p>The most en­chant­ing was The Vis­i­ta­tion, a phan­tas­magor­i­cal choose-your-own-ad­ven­ture story writ­ten by Dave Chua and il­lus­trated by Xiao Yan.</p>
    <p>The fes­ti­val was not with­out teething prob­lems. At the out­set, the Sis­tic Live plat­form would log me out when I tried to join a live stream, so I missed the first few min­utes of sev­eral events.</p>
    <p>There was a clear dis­par­ity in video qual­ity be­tween the mod­er­a­tors in Sin­ga­pore and the pre­sen­ters, many of whom were us­ing ba­sic home equip­ment.</p>
    <p>It took days, some­times a whole week, for video-on-de­mand pro­grammes to ap­pear. Even­tu­ally, the fes­ti­val an­nounced that videoon-de­mand avail­abil­ity would be ex­tended to Nov 18.</p>
    <p>Yet for all its flaws, there were mo­ments in which the fes­ti­val tran­scended the lim­its of its format to cre­ate un­mis­take­able con­nec­tion.</p>
    <p>Watch­ing Amer­i­can poet Tracy K. Smith read her poem Wade In The Wa­ter and re­peat the re­frain “I love you” – said to her by a to­tal stranger in a ring shout – I felt tears well up in my eyes.</p>
    <p>Though much re­duced, the fes­ti­val has man­aged to make a space of its own for the strange times peo­ple are liv­ing in.</p>
