    <p>The num­ber of Hous­ing Board re­sale flats sold for $1 mil­lion or more each has hit a new high, fol­low­ing 13 trans­ac­tions done last month, ac­cord­ing to data from real es­tate por­tal SRX re­leased yes­ter­day. The 72 mil­lion-dol­lar flats sold from Jan­uary to last month com­pare with 64 such units for the whole of last year.</p>
    <p>The num­ber of Hous­ing Board (HDB) re­sale flats sold for $1 mil­lion or more each has hit a new high, fol­low­ing 13 trans­ac­tions done last month, ac­cord­ing to data from real es­tate por­tal SRX re­leased yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The 72 mil­lion-dol­lar flats sold from Jan­uary to last month com­pare with 64 such units for the whole of last year.</p>
    <p>SRX’s flash es­ti­mates for last month also re­veal that HDB re­sale prices rose for the fifth con­sec­u­tive month, though the vol­ume of trans­ac­tions dipped.</p>
    <p>At the top end of the HDB re­sale mar­ket, a five-room unit at The Pin­na­cle @ Dux­ton sold for $1,248,000, which was the high­est trans­acted price reg­is­tered for a re­sale flat last month.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, a five-room De­sign, Build and Sell Scheme flat in Park­land Res­i­dences in Hougang sold for $810,000, record­ing the high­est re­sale price in</p>
    <p>non-ma­ture es­tates.</p>
    <p>PropNex head of re­search and con­tent Wong Siew Ying said buy­ers of mil­lion-dol­lar HDB flats may be will­ing to pay so much ow­ing to their cen­tral lo­ca­tions, the conve</p>
    <p>nience of be­ing near the city and the ameni­ties avail­able.</p>
    <p>She added that as pri­vate condo prices have re­mained re­silient through­out the pan­demic, some buy­ers may have turned to the</p>
    <p>HDB re­sale mar­ket for flats that bet­ter fit their bud­get and hous­ing needs.</p>
    <p>“A fam­ily-size pri­vate condo in</p>
    <p>the suburbs could cost $1.5 mil­lion, but for $1 mil­lion or so, the buyer can get a rel­a­tively sim­i­lar-sized HDB re­sale unit on a high floor and in a prime spot near the city,” she said.</p>
    <p>In the over­all HDB re­sale mar­ket, prices rose 1 per cent last month from Oc­to­ber. Last month’s re­sale prices are 5 per cent higher than a year ago but 9.5 per cent lower than their peak in April 2013.</p>
    <p>Prices in non-ma­ture es­tates climbed 1.3 per cent com­pared with Oc­to­ber, while those in ma­ture es­tates rose by 0.7 per cent.</p>
    <p>The num­ber of re­sale trans­ac­tions last month dropped 4.3 per cent from Oc­to­ber to 2,331, ac­cord­ing to SRX data.</p>
    <p>This vol­ume, though, was 21.7 per cent higher than in the same month last year.</p>
    <p>Of the HDB flats sold last month, 41.9 per cent were four-room flats, 26.6 per cent were five-room flats, 22.1 per cent were three-room flats and 8.2 per cent were ex­ec­u­tive flats. The rest of the trans­ac­tions in­volved multi-gen­er­a­tion, one­room and two-room flats.</p>
    <p>Com­ment­ing on the fewer num­ber of trans­ac­tions, OrangeTee & Tie head of re­search and con­sul­tancy Chris­tine Sun said that this could be the re­sult of sell­ers rais­ing their ask­ing prices fol­low­ing re­cent mar­ket ex­u­ber­ance and stel­lar sales inked over the past few months.</p>
    <p>She added that many re­sale flats are cur­rently trans­acted above val­u­a­tion.</p>
    <p>Data from SRX showed that the over­all me­dian trans­ac­tion over Xvalue (TOX) was a pos­i­tive $1,000 last month, though this was a drop of $2,000 com­pared with Oc­to­ber.</p>
    <p>Me­dian TOX mea­sures whether peo­ple are over­pay­ing (in the case of pos­i­tive TOX) or un­der­pay­ing (when there is neg­a­tive TOX) rel­a­tive to the SRX Prop­erty X-value es­ti­mated mar­ket value for flats.</p>
    <p>Flats in Seran­goon recorded the high­est me­dian TOX at pos­i­tive $11,000, while those in Bis­han had the low­est me­dian TOX at neg­a­tive $12,000.</p>
    <p>For the first eleven months of this year, 21,876 re­sale flats were sold, based on last month’s flash data, said Ms Sun.</p>
    <p>“We es­ti­mate that around 23,000 to 24,000 HDB re­sale flats could be trans­acted this year, which is quite sim­i­lar to the 23,714 re­sale trans­ac­tions inked in 2019,” she said.</p>
