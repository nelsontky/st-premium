    <p>Third seed Daniil Medvedev bat­tled past Mi­los Raonic yes­ter­day to reach his first fi­nal of the sea­son at the Paris Masters, where he will face Rafael Nadal or Alexan­der Zverev.</p>
    <p>The Rus­sian, 24, edged out the big-serv­ing Raonic 6-4, 7-6 (7-4) for his third vic­tory in as many meet­ings with the Cana­dian.</p>
    <p>Medvedev, who won both the Cincin­nati and Shang­hai Masters last year, is look­ing for his eighth ca­reer ti­tle. All seven of his pre­vi­ous tour­na­ment suc­cesses have also come on hard courts.</p>
    <p>“The first set was great, I think he maybe only won one or two points on my serve,” he said. “Sec­ond set was tougher, I had to save some break points. Re­ally happy to be through in the fi­nal.</p>
    <p>“I al­ways take it 50-50. There are two play­ers, only one can win. It’s never easy.”</p>
    <p>Top seed Nadal, bid­ding for a maiden ti­tle at Bercy Arena, took</p>
    <p>on the in-form Zverev later yes­ter­day. The re­sult was not avail­able at press time.</p>
    <p>Medvedev has never beaten Nadal in three matches and has a 5-1 los­ing record against Zverev.</p>
    <p>The world No. 5 took a tight open­ing set by a sin­gle break as both men served strongly, drop­ping just four points on first serves be­tween them.</p>
    <p>The drama came at the end of the sec­ond set as, after Raonic missed three break points for a 5-3 lead, he was bro­ken him­self in the 11th game.</p>
    <p>But Medvedev failed to serve out the match as the Cana­dian forced a tie-break. The Rus­sian pow­ered into a 4-0 lead in the tie-breaker, only for for­mer Wim­ble­don run­ner-up Raonic to peg him back to 5-4, but he se­cured a fi­nal spot on his first match point with a smash into the open court.</p>
    <p>Sep­a­rately, No­vak Djokovic has sealed the year-end men’s world No. 1 rank­ing for the sixth time to go level with child­hood hero Pete Sam­pras, after clos­est ri­val Nadal opted against play­ing in this week’s ATP Tour event in Sofia.</p>
    <p>Nadal, ranked sec­ond, was the only player who had a chance of stop­ping the Serb from fin­ish­ing as the top-ranked player.</p>
