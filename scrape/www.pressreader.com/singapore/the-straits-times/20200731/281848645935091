    <p>A diplo­matic row be­tween Kuala Lumpur and Manila is flar­ing up after the Philip­pines’ for­eign min­is­ter fired a tweet this week to again as­sert Philip­pine own­er­ship of the Malaysian state of Sabah on Bor­neo is­land.</p>
    <p>For­eign Sec­re­tary Teodoro Loc­sin said in a Twit­ter post on Mon­day that “Sabah is not in Malaysia, if you want to have any­thing to do with the Philip­pines”.</p>
    <p>His tweet was a re­ac­tion to a US Em­bassy item about a do­na­tion of hy­giene kits to over 300 Filipinos repa­tri­ated from Sabah to the south­ern Philip­pine is­land of Min­danao.</p>
    <p>The em­bassy de­scribed the area strad­dling both na­tions as part of Malaysia.</p>
    <p>On Wednes­day, Malaysia’s For­eign Min­is­ter Hisham­mud­din Hussein replied on his of­fi­cial Twit­ter ac­count that Mr Loc­sin’s state­ment was “ir­re­spon­si­ble”.</p>
    <p>He said: “Sabah is, and will al­ways be, part of Malaysia.” Mr Hisham­mudin also said he would sum­mon the Philip­pines’ am­bas­sador to Kuala Lumpur Charles Jose to ex­plain.</p>
    <p>Mr Loc­sin re­fused to back down yes­ter­day. In an­other tweet, he in­sisted his state­ment about Sabah was “his­tor­i­cally fac­tual”. He said: “No coun­try can tell an­other coun­try what it can and can­not say about what the lat­ter re­gards as right­fully his own.”</p>
    <p>Mr Loc­sin added, al­lud­ing to an in­ter­na­tional rul­ing that recog­nised the Philip­pines’ claims to parts of the South China Sea: “I don’t in­sist China say only what we want to hear about the ar­bi­tral award. It is free to say what it wants, while we say and do what needs do­ing. That holds for Sabah.”</p>
    <p>He dis­closed that as a re­sponse, he would sum­mon Malaysia’s am­bas­sador to Manila, Mr Nor­man Muham­mad, to ex­plain Mr Hisham­mudin’s re­ac­tion to his tweet.</p>
    <p>Upon his elec­tion in 2016, Pres­i­dent Ro­drigo Duterte said he would press the Philip­pines’ con­tentious claim to Sabah.</p>
    <p>The dis­pute goes back to 1878, when the Sul­tanate of Sulu signed a contract, known as a pa­jak, that al­lowed the Bri­tish North Bor­neo Com­pany ad­min­is­tra­tion to oc­cupy Sabah in per­pe­tu­ity as long as it paid a reg­u­lar sum of money.</p>
    <p>Sulu is a group of is­lands in south­ern Philip­pines.</p>
    <p>The Sul­tan of Brunei gave Sabah to the Sul­tan of Sulu in 1658, ei­ther as a dowry or be­cause troops from Sulu helped him quell a re­bel­lion.</p>
    <p>The Bri­tish colo­nial govern­ment suc­ceeded the Bri­tish North Bor­neo Com­pany. In 1946, Sabah be­came a Crown Colony. In 1963, it was folded with Malaya, Sarawak and Sin­ga­pore into the Fed­er­a­tion of Malaysia.</p>
    <p>While the Bri­tish and Malaysia in­ter­preted pa­jak to mean sale, the Sulu Sul­tanate has al­ways main­tained it means lease.</p>
    <p>Even to­day, Malaysia pays about RM5,000 (S$1,620) a year to the Sul­tan’s heirs.</p>
    <p>Suc­ces­sive Philip­pine pres­i­dents have pressed the Sulu Sul­tanate’s case.</p>
