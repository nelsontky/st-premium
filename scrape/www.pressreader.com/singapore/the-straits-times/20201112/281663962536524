    <p>•</p>
    <p>TOKYO As Covid-19 cases in Ja­pan rise again, an ex­pert ad­vis­ing the gov­ern­ment said lo­calised ap­proaches are needed to counter a pos­si­ble surge dur­ing win­ter.</p>
    <p>Daily cases in the north­ern is­land of Hokkaido have reached record highs re­cently, while Tokyo re­ported 317 new cases yes­ter­day, cross­ing the 300 mark for the first time since Au­gust.</p>
    <p>Tokyo has been the hard­est-hit among Ja­pan’s 47 pre­fec­tures, with a to­tal of 33,377 cases.</p>
    <p>The sources of those and other clus­ters are dif­fer­ent and re­quire fo­cused at­ten­tion, said To­hoku Uni­ver­sity pro­fes­sor Hi­toshi Oshi­tani.</p>
    <p>“There is no sin­gle so­lu­tion for the whole coun­try,” said Pro­fes­sor Oshi­tani, who is on a panel ad­vis­ing the gov­ern­ment and helped build</p>
    <p>Ja­pan’s con­ta­gion clus­ter-bust­ing strat­egy. “We are propos­ing to have a risk-based ap­proach in each pre­fec­ture. They have to do more close mon­i­tor­ing of the clus­ters.”</p>
    <p>The Hokkaido in­fec­tions are cen­tred on entertainm­ent ar­eas, while those around the western me­trop­o­lis of Osaka are clus­tered around nursing homes and hos­pi­tals, said Prof Oshi­tani.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, Ja­pan re­ported 1,536 new cases – the high­est fig­ure since Aug 8 – bring­ing the to­tal to more than 108,000 cases, with over 1,840 deaths.</p>
    <p>The gov­ern­ment has pledged to pro­vide free vac­ci­na­tions for the whole pop­u­lace by the mid­dle of next year, and it has se­cured sup­plies of vac­cine can­di­dates in­clud­ing one by Pfizer. Even so, Prof Oshi</p>
    <p>tani ex­pressed doubt that the vac­cines would be an im­me­di­ate fix.</p>
    <p>“We have to live with the virus for some time,” he said. “I’m not sure if it’s for months or years.”</p>
    <p>The gov­ern­ment is strength­en­ing its mea­sures against Covid-19 clus­ters, in­clud­ing ad­vis­ing shops and of­fices to keep their build­ings thor­oughly ven­ti­lated, even as the</p>
    <p>tem­per­a­ture drops.</p>
    <p>The risk of in­fec­tion rises in the win­ter be­cause peo­ple tend to keep the win­dows closed, so eater­ies and busi­nesses will be asked to mon­i­tor the hu­mid­ity level and keep their premises well ven­ti­lated. The gov­ern­ment rec­om­mends a hu­mid­ity level of at least 40 per cent.</p>
    <p>As it is dif­fi­cult to de­tect clus­ters in restau­rants and entertainm­ent out­lets in the nightlife district, as well as among for­eign residents, uni­ver­sity stu­dents and other young peo­ple who are asymp­to­matic, the plan is to iden­tify the clus­ters early by tak­ing mea­sures spe­cific to each de­mo­graphic.</p>
    <p>For­eign residents will be given in</p>
    <p>for­ma­tion in mul­ti­ple lan­guages. Uni­ver­si­ties will do their part to raise aware­ness among stu­dents and pro­vide rapid virus test­ing. Large-scale poly­merase chain re­ac­tion tests will also be car­ried out in the event of a clus­ter emerg­ing in a nightlife district.</p>
