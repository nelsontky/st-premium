    <p>VENICE • Hol­ly­wood star Cate Blanchett said on Wed­nes­day that she would rather be called an ac­tor than an ac­tress.</p>
    <p>The Aus­tralian, who is head­ing the jury at the Venice Film Fes­ti­val, gave her back­ing to Ber­lin fes­ti­val’s con­tro­ver­sial de­ci­sion last week to do away with gen­dered prizes and give only a best ac­tor award.</p>
    <p>“I have al­ways re­ferred to my­self as an ac­tor,” Blanchett, 51, said af­ter be­ing asked about the move to­wards gen­der-neu­tral prizes hours be­fore the 10-day Venice jam­boree, re­stricted by pan­demic safety mea­sures, be­gan.</p>
    <p>“I am of the gen­er­a­tion where the word ac­tress was al­most al­ways used in a pe­jo­ra­tive sense. So I claim the other space,” she told Agence France-Presse.</p>
    <p>She then asked re­porters if there was a fe­male equiv­a­lent of the Ital­ian word “mae­stro”, only to be told there was not.</p>
    <p>Blanchett is tak­ing the helm at Venice – once slammed by fem­i­nists for the “toxic mas­culin­ity” of its se­lec­tion – in a year when the num­ber of women di­rec­tors vy­ing for the top prize has quadru­pled to eight.</p>
    <p>“I think a good per­for­mance is a good per­for­mance, no mat­ter the sex­ual orientatio­n of who is mak­ing them,” she told re­porters.</p>
    <p>Venice was heav­ily crit­i­cised for se­lect­ing only one fe­male film­maker to com­pete for the Golden Lion in 2017 and 2018.</p>
    <p>And there was greater fury last year when Roman Polan­ski – wanted in the United States for the statu­tory rape of a 13-year-old girl in 1977 – was se­lected for and won the fes­ti­val’s sec­ond prize for his his­tor­i­cal drama, An Of­fi­cer And A Spy.</p>
    <p>But in the run-up to the fes­ti­val – the first ma­jor film gath­er­ing since the coro­n­avirus struck – Blanchett told Va­ri­ety that the record eight women di­rec­tors this year was “a di­rect re­sponse to the pos­i­tive ad­vances that have been made”.</p>
    <p>Os­car win­ner Blanchett has be­come a ma­jor player in Hol­ly­wood gen­der pol­i­tics since the #Me­Too move­ment sparked by the Harvey We­in­stein scan­dal.</p>
    <p>She led a red-car­pet protest for equal­ity by an army of fe­male stars and di­rec­tors at the ri­val Cannes film fes­ti­val two years ago.</p>
    <p>Blanchett, who has head­lined films such as Carol (2015) and El­iz­a­beth (1998), has also been a prom­i­nent sup­porter of the in­dus­try’s Time’s Up and #50/50 move­ments for gen­der par­ity and against sex­ual ha­rass­ment in the wake of for­mer film pro­ducer We­in­stein’s dis­grace.</p>
    <p>Vet­eran French di­rec­tor Claire De­nis, who is head­ing the jury for Venice’s “Hori­zons” side­bar com­pe­ti­tion, said the lim­its of gen­dered prizes were clear when giv­ing a prize to “some­one who has played the role of a man or a woman and who is trans­gen­der”.</p>
    <p>But some stereo­types are slow to die. Blanchett was asked at one stage dur­ing the news con­fer­ence be­fore the fes­ti­val’s open­ing gala whether she had asked her hus­band if she could go to Venice, given the risk of a sec­ond wave of the coro­n­avirus. “My hus­band said I had per­mis­sion to leave,” she replied drily. “My chil­dren, not so much.”</p>
