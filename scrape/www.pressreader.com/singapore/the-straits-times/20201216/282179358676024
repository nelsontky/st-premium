    <p>The po­lice are in­ves­ti­gat­ing protests held in sev­eral lo­ca­tions in Sin­ga­pore in sup­port of farm­ers in In­dia.</p>
    <p>Im­ages of the protests, al­legedly held with­out a po­lice per­mit, were posted on so­cial me­dia but were later taken down.</p>
    <p>In a state­ment yes­ter­day, the po­lice said or­gan­is­ing or tak­ing part in a pub­lic as­sem­bly with­out a po­lice per­mit is il­le­gal and an of­fence un­der the Pub­lic Or­der Act.</p>
    <p>They fur­ther said they will not grant a per­mit for any as­sem­bly that ad­vo­cates po­lit­i­cal causes of other coun­tries.</p>
    <p>“For­eign­ers vis­it­ing or liv­ing in Sin­ga­pore should abide by our laws,” said the po­lice. “Those who break the law will be dealt with firmly, and this may in­clude ter­mi­na­tion of visa or work passes, where ap­pli­ca­ble.”</p>
    <p>Farm­ers in north­ern In­dia have been protest­ing against Prime Min­is­ter Naren­dra Modi’s de­ci­sion in Septem­ber to re­move the sys­tem of govern­ment-run pur­chase of crops in a whole­sale mar­ket, which had en­sured a min­i­mum price for their pro­duce.</p>
    <p>They say the move will hurt their liveli­hood and have turned down pro­pos­als for dis­cus­sions with the govern­ment.</p>
    <p>The protests have made waves on so­cial me­dia that are rip­pling be­yond In­dia’s bor­ders to coun­tries with sig­nif­i­cant In­dian di­as­pora com­mu­ni­ties. On Mon­day, Al Jazeera re­ported that ear­lier this month, thou­sands of Bri­tish Pun­jabis had gath­ered out­side the High Com­mis­sion of In­dia in cen­tral Lon­don, in sup­port of the strik­ing farm­ers, or “kisaan” as they are known in Pun­jabi.</p>
