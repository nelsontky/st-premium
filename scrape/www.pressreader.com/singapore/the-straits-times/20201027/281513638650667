    <p>Pro-democ­racy pro­test­ers gath­ered out­side the Ger­man Em­bassy dur­ing a rally in Bangkok yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Both roy­al­ists and pro-democ­racy pro­test­ers ral­lied at the em­bassy and made con­trast­ing ap­peals to the Euro­pean coun­try, where Thai King Maha Va­ji­ra­longkorn spends much of his time.</p>
    <p>The ral­lies came as Thai law­mak­ers be­gan a de­bate in a spe­cial Par­lia­ment sit­ting yes­ter­day to find a way out of the cur­rent po­lit­i­cal tur­moil that has seen thou­sands of pro-democ­racy pro­test­ers hit the streets in re­cent months call­ing for changes in the Con­sti­tu­tion and re­form in the monar­chy.</p>
    <p>Ger­many found it­self em­broiled in Thai­land’s po­lit­i­cal tur­moil yes­ter­day as both roy­al­ists and prodemoc­racy pro­test­ers made con­trast­ing ap­peals to the Euro­pean coun­try, where King Maha Va­ji­ra­longkorn spends much of his time.</p>
    <p>Sup­port­ers from both sides ral­lied at the Ger­man Em­bassy in Bangkok as Thai­land opened a spe­cial par­lia­men­tary sit­ting yes­ter­day to find a way out of the cur­rent cri­sis, i n which months of street protests by young de­mon­stra­tors de­mand­ing po­lit­i­cal change and monar­chy re­form have trig­gered an in­creas­ingly threat­en­ing push­back from roy­al­ists.</p>
    <p>Roy­al­ist Ni­tithorn Lam­lua l ed dozens of sup­port­ers early yes­ter­day af­ter­noon to hand a let­ter to Ger­many’s Am­bas­sador to Thai­land Ge­org Sch­midt.</p>
    <p>“I am con­cerned some groups are try­ing to pull Ger­many into Thai­land’s af­fairs,” Mr Ni­tithorn told The Straits Times. “I want them to lis­ten to the voices of Thai peo­ple from all sides to get in­for­ma­tion that is cor­rect and com­plete.”</p>
    <p>In the evening, young pro-democ­racy pro­test­ers marched to the Ger­man Em­bassy to sub­mit another ap­peal, ask­ing Ber­lin to clar­ify if King Va­ji­ra­longkorn had paid in­her­i­tance tax to Ger­many since he as­cended the throne, and whether he had con­ducted Thai pol­i­tics from Ger­man soil.</p>
    <p>For­eign Min­is­ter Heiko Maas said yes­ter­day that Ger­many is con­tin­u­ing to look into the be­hav­iour of the King. “We are mon­i­tor­ing this long term,” Mr Maas said. “It will have im­me­di­ate con­se­quences if there are things that we as­sess to be il­le­gal.”</p>
    <p>King Va­ji­ra­longkorn, 68, took per­sonal own­er­ship of the multi­bil­lion­dol­lar as­sets of Thai­land’s Crown Prop­erty Bureau two years ago, and also con­trols two army units.</p>
    <p>His sta­tus in Ger­many came un­der scru­tiny in the Bun­destag ear­lier this month when, in re­sponse to a query from a law­maker, Mr Maas said guests in Ger­many were not al­lowed to con­duct state busi­ness from Ger­man soil.</p>
    <p>King Va­ji­ra­longkorn’s power and spend­ing have been a source of re­sent­ment to youth driv­ing the months-long street protest move­ment, which wants the mil­i­tary­backed Con­sti­tu­tion to be amended, Prime Min­is­ter Prayut Chan-o-cha to re­sign and the monar­chy to be re­formed.</p>
    <p>Pro­test­ers want the King’s pow­ers to be trimmed in line with his of­fi­cial sta­tus as a con­sti­tu­tional monarch, a sen­si­tive is­sue in a coun­try where in­sult­ing the King is pun­ish­able by up to 15 years in prison.</p>
    <p>The protests es­ca­lated af­ter Prime Min­is­ter Prayut de­clared a se­ri­ous emer­gency in Bangkok on Oct 15 and po­lice un­leashed wa­ter can­non on the l argely peace­ful de­mon­stra­tors.</p>
    <p>Last week, Mr Prayut was forced to re­voke the emer­gency dec­la­ra­tion to lower ten­sions.</p>
    <p>Yet, sev­eral key protest lead­ers have been de­nied bail af­ter ar­rest. They in­clude Tham­masat Univer­sity stu­dents Parit Chi­warak and Panusaya Sithi­ji­rawat­tanakul, who have been most vo­cal about monar­chy re­form.</p>
    <p>In their ab­sence, more younger faces have sprung up to drive the move­ment, which massed thou­sands of sup­port­ers in down­town Bangkok’s Ratchapra­song in­ter­sec­tion on Sun­day night.</p>
    <p>Roy­al­ists have also started try­ing to mo­bilise sup­port­ers to demon­strate loy­alty to the King, who last week pub­licly praised a man for stand­ing up to pro-democ­racy pro­test­ers.</p>
    <p>It is un­clear what the par­lia­men­tary sit­ting, which con­tin­ues to­day, will achieve as few law­mak­ers were in the mood for com­pro­mise yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Mr Prayut said at its open­ing: “I am con­fi­dent that to­day, re­gard­less of our dif­fer­ent po­lit­i­cal views, ev­ery­one still loves the coun­try.”</p>
    <p>Par­lia­men­tar­i­ans al­lied with the coali­tion gov­ern­ment dis­missed calls for both his res­ig­na­tion and monar­chy re­form.</p>
    <p>Ap­pointed Sen­a­tor Som­chai Sawaengkar­n said: “The Prime Min­is­ter should not re­sign, and I want to give him my sup­port. Stay and fight.”</p>
    <p>He al­leged that politi­cians were mas­ter­mind­ing the street protests.</p>
    <p>“The cause of th­ese prob­lems are not the Con­sti­tu­tion, the Prime Min­is­ter nor the monar­chy,” he said.</p>
