    <p>LONDON • Amer­i­can ac­tress Am­ber Heard (left) said her for­mer hus­band Johnny Depp threw dozens of bot­tles at her “like grenades”, as she gave ev­i­dence for a third day at his London li­bel ac­tion on Wed­nes­day.</p>
    <p>Heard, 34, said Depp, 57, had lobbed “all the bot­tles in reach” to­wards her dur­ing an ex­plo­sive 2015 row on a trip to Aus­tralia.</p>
    <p>Depp is su­ing the pub­lish­ers of Bri­tish tabloid The Sun, News Group News­pa­pers (NGN) and the writer of a 2018 ar­ti­cle that la­belled him a “wife beater” at London’s High Court.</p>
    <p>The Pi­rates Of The Caribbean star has em­phat­i­cally de­nied 14 claims of vi­o­lence that NGN said proves its story, and has sought to por­tray Heard as a cal­cu­lat­ing and dis­hon­est fan­ta­sist in­tent on de­stroy­ing his life.</p>
    <p>The ar­ti­cle in The Sun had caused him se­ri­ous rep­u­ta­tional dam­age, he ar­gues.</p>
    <p>Heard has ac­cused Depp of sus­tained ver­bal and phys­i­cal abuse, as well as dis­play­ing “ex­tremely con­trol­ling and in­tim­i­dat­ing be­hav­iour”.</p>
    <p>The cou­ple met on the set of the 2011 film The Rum Diary and mar­ried in 2015, but di­vorced two years later.</p>
    <p>Wed­nes­day’s cross-ex­am­i­na­tion fo­cused on Heard’s al­le­ga­tions that Depp had re­peat­edly as­saulted her in Aus­tralia, fu­elled by drink and drugs, as well as other in­ci­dents in the United States.</p>
    <p>“He started pick­ing them (bot­tles) up one by one and throw­ing them like grenades,” she said dur­ing ques­tion­ing by one of the ac­tor’s lawyers, adding that he had lobbed around 30 in to­tal.</p>
    <p>“He threw all the bot­tles that were in reach, all ex­cept for one which was a cel­e­bra­tory mag­num­sized bot­tle of wine.”</p>
    <p>The court had heard that Depp’s fin­ger was sev­ered dur­ing the al­leged in­ci­dent. The Hol­ly­wood star blamed his ex-wife for the in­jury.</p>
    <p>But Heard de­nied it and re­jected an­other claim that she had stubbed a cig­a­rette out on his cheek.</p>
    <p>“No, Johnny did it right in front of me, he of­ten did things like that,” she added of the burn.</p>
    <p>Depp’s lawyer Eleanor Laws also asked her about an al­leged De­cem­ber 2015 in­ci­dent of do­mes­tic vi­o­lence in Los An­ge­les, which Heard has de­scribed as “one of the worst and most vi­o­lent nights of our re­la­tion­ship”.</p>
    <p>She de­fended claims that Depp had slapped her, dragged her by the hair through their apart­ment – pulling out clumps of her hair – and re­peat­edly punched her in the head.</p>
    <p>“I had two black eyes, a bro­ken nose, a bro­ken rib... I had bruises all over my body,” she said, af­ter Ms Laws ar­gued that a nurse who had ex­am­ined her shortly af­ter the row said she found no bruises.</p>
    <p>The three-week trial is ex­pected to con­tinue into next week, with a judge ex­pected to rule on the case at a later date.</p>
