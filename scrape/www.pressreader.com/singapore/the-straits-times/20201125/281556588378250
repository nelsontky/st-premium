    <p>The work group on sus­tain­ing the hawker trade re­port, sub­mit­ted to the Na­tional En­vi­ron­ment Agency (NEA) yes­ter­day, found five key chal­lenges that modern hawk­ers face.</p>
    <p>The first is con­tin­ued neg­a­tive pub­lic per­cep­tion to­wards the trade, which the 19-mem­ber group said could be tack­led through greater use of dig­i­tal me­dia and more plat­forms for the pub­lic to cel­e­brate, share and pro­file hawk­ers.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to an NEA sur­vey last year, 87.3 per cent of re­spon­dents said they would not want to be hawk­ers. Through dig­i­tal me­dia and doc­u­men­tary se­ries that share hawk­ers’ jour­ney, the nar­ra­tive can be re­freshed and a more pos­i­tive im­pres­sion of hawk­ers formed, the re­port said.</p>
    <p>The sec­ond and third chal­lenges are dif­fi­cul­ties faced by new en­trants to the trade and chal­lenges faced by vet­eran hawk­ers in find­ing suc­ces­sors to their busi­ness.</p>
    <p>Pro­grammes such as the hawker suc­ces­sion scheme and paid trainee­ships can help with these, al­low­ing for the trans­mis­sion of skills from the old to the young that have been hard-earned over the decades, the re­port said.</p>
    <p>It also sug­gested col­lab­o­ra­tion with ter­tiary and culi­nary in­sti­tu­tions to cod­ify hawker food recipes to make the learn­ing curve less steep for young hawk­ers.</p>
    <p>A fourth chal­lenge is in­creas­ing com­pe­ti­tion from other es­tab­lish­ments in the food and bev­er­age in­dus­try, in terms of both pa­trons and em­ploy­ees.</p>
    <p>The re­port called on the Gov­ern­ment to pos­si­bly re­view re­stric­tions that al­low only Sin­ga­pore­ans and per­ma­nent res­i­dents to be hawker as­sis­tants if the man­power crunch con­tin­ues.</p>
    <p>Fifth, some hawk­ers found it too ex­pen­sive to buy equip­ment that could in­crease their pro­duc­tiv­ity, a com­plaint that can be eased with an ex­ten­sion of ex­ist­ing pro­duc­tiv­ity grants, for ex­am­ple.</p>
    <p>More than half of the work group are made up of hawk­ers, while the rest are hawker food ad­vo­cates, and stake­hold­ers in academia and the pub­lic and pri­vate sec­tors.</p>
