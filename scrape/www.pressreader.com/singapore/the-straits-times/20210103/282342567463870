    <p>A slew of plant-based prod­uct launches here ended last year on a high, with the spot­light trained on the boom­ing al­ter­na­tive meat in­dus­try.</p>
    <p>Covid-19 has ac­cel­er­ated the growth of the plant-based prod­uct scene, say i ndus­try play­ers, as peo­ple be­come more con­cerned about food se­cu­rity and more so­cially con­scious – whether for sus­tain­abil­ity, en­vi­ron­men­tal, eth­i­cal or health rea­sons.</p>
    <p>Last year saw the de­but of var­i­ous prod­ucts in­clud­ing Good Meat cell-cul­tured chicken by Cal­i­for­nian start-up Eat Just, the Nether­lands’ plant-based brand The Veg­e­tar­ian Butcher and home-grown meat-free brand ALTN by Tee Yih Jia Food Man­u­fac­tur­ing – best known as a man­u­fac­turer of popiah skin and frozen con­ve­nience food.</p>
    <p>ALTN, which has been two years in the mak­ing, fea­tures a range of frozen, ready meals and snacks made with plant-based pro­teins such as fun­gus, peas and soya beans.</p>
    <p>Ex­pect a greater pro­lif­er­a­tion of meat sub­sti­tutes to con­tinue flood­ing the scene this year, as Sin­ga­pore shapes up to be­come a hub for al­ter­na­tive meats.</p>
    <p>All eyes are now on Hong Kong’s plant-based life­style plat­form Green Mon­day Group, which will open its con­cept store and cafe Green Com­mon this month at VivoCity. Span­ning more than 3,000 sq ft, the plant-based on­estop shop will fea­ture a va­ri­ety of brands, in­clud­ing Be­yond, Heura and Al­pha Foods.</p>
    <p>Green Mon­day – best known as the creator of Om­niFoods – re­cently launched its Om­niMeat lun­cheon meat and pork-like Om­niMeat Strip at se­lected restau­rants and FairPrice supermarke­ts.</p>
    <p>Next up, food tech com­pany Next Gen will de­but plant-based chicken here in March. The brand set up its re­search and de­vel­op­ment cen­tre and head­quar­ters here in Oc­to­ber.</p>
    <p>Other lo­cal com­pa­nies mak­ing waves in­clude Float Foods, which will roll out its plant-based egg patty and shred­ded egg – good for stir-fries and fried rice – later this year. Its plant­based whole egg sub­sti­tute – called On­lyEg (be­low) – is made with legumes and will launch in the first quar­ter of next year.</p>
    <p>In another lab­o­ra­tory across the is­land, Ants In­no­vate, a spin-off from the Agency for Science, Tech­nol­ogy and Re­search, is work­ing at cre­at­ing cuts of pork us­ing cell­cul­ture tech­nol­ogy. Its cul­ti­vated meat snack and cut­let – which moves be­yond minced meat – are slated to de­but later this year.</p>
    <p>Within the next few years, the com­pany is also look­ing to churn out steak and pork belly.</p>
    <p>In­deed, Mr Yuan Oeij, chair­man of The Prive Group, fore­sees the plant-based move­ment ven­tur­ing be­yond op­tions such as minced meat and nuggets to more sub­stan­tial cuts.</p>
    <p>Con­stantly on the look­out for brands to work with for his restau­rants, he hopes more al­ter­na­tive seafood choices enter the mar­ket. He pays at­ten­tion to plant-based brands that of­fer prod­ucts that are “cleaner” – where lesser in­gre­di­ents and ad­di­tives are used.</p>
    <p>To spread aware­ness, the ve­gan restau­ra­teur is also ac­tive in en­gag­ing fel­low food and bev­er­age op­er­a­tors to of­fer more plant-based op­tions on the menu and go be­yond of­fer­ing a to­ken dish to test the mar­ket.</p>
    <p>Mr Oeij says: “There is a huge lack of places that cater well to mixed palates. Peo­ple dine out as a group and you could at­tract more din­ers with a wider va­ri­ety on the menu.</p>
    <p>“As de­mand for plant-based op­tions is con­stantly in­creas­ing, it is not a fad. Peo­ple who are will­ing to make the switch are still a mi­nor­ity and it will take time. What’s great is that Sin­ga­pore is ris­ing as a front run­ner and brands set­ting up shop here put us on the map.”</p>
