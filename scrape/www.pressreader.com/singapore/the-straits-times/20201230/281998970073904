    <p>In­stead of par­ty­ing on New Year’s Eve, 18 Sin­ga­pore­ans will be ush­er­ing in 2021 by cy­cling around the is­land for a good cause.</p>
    <p>For ev­ery kilo­me­tre out of the 120km each cy­clist cov­ers, 1kg of rice will be do­nated to the el­derly and those in need.</p>
    <p>The event will be­gin at 2.30pm to­mor­row and end around mid­night.</p>
    <p>The ini­tia­tive is the brain­child of 11-year-old Ashley Rao.</p>
    <p>The Pri­mary 5 pupil came up with the idea ear­lier this month to com­bine her par­ents’ pas­sions.</p>
    <p>Her fa­ther, Mr Danny Ngeow, is re­tired from the in­vest­ment in­dus­try and an avid cy­clist at 54.</p>
    <p>Her mother, Ms Fion Phua, 50, is the founder of vol­un­teer plat­form Keep­ing Hope Alive, which reg­u­larly checks on and helps the el­derly and those in need across Sin­ga­pore on Sun­days.</p>
    <p>Ashley said: “I hope we can raise a lot of rice and give it to a lot of peo­ple who need it.”</p>
    <p>The Tiong Bahru Yong Tao Hu eatery and rice brand SongHe have pledged 2 tonnes of rice to be dis­trib­uted to about 800 house­holds.</p>
    <p>Ms Phua and her vol­un­teers will dis­trib­ute the rice dur­ing their reg­u­lar vol­un­teer­ing ses­sions start­ing next Tues­day.</p>
    <p>Mr Ngeow, along with his cy­clist friends and vol­un­teers from Keep­ing Hope Alive, will cy­cle around Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>Mr Ng Keng Guan is the youngest cy­clist at 18 and Mr Ngiam Kim Sng is the old­est at 71.</p>
    <p>Both of them are no strangers to long-dis­tance cy­cling, though nei­ther has cy­cled 120km be­fore.</p>
    <p>LOOK­ING OUT FOR OTH­ERS</p>
    <p>For the past few months, Mr Ngiam, Mr Ng and sev­eral vol­un­teers from Keep­ing Hope Alive have been cy­cling reg­u­larly on Fri­day nights from Cle­menti to East Coast Park and back, cov­er­ing about 60km.</p>
    <p>“I thought it was a very good idea to take part in this ini­tia­tive, it’s very worth­while,” said Mr Ng.</p>
    <p>“I also wanted be more pro­duc­tive. Some peo­ple say young peo­ple don’t spend their time wisely be­cause they stay home and play video games, so this is a more ef­fec­tive way of spending my time do­ing some­thing good for so­ci­ety.”</p>
    <p>Mr Ngiam said the cy­clists will stay 1m away from one another</p>
    <p>and wear hel­mets.</p>
    <p>De­spite his age, Mr Ngiam is ac­tive. He runs, plays bad­minton and swims reg­u­larly.</p>
    <p>“I like to ex­er­cise, I’m a very ac­tive per­son,” he said.</p>
    <p>He is con­fi­dent that he will be able to com­plete the 120km route, which be­gins in Fort Road and ends at the Ma­rina Bar­rage.</p>
    <p>“I know my own abil­ity. I am wor­ried about some of the other rid­ers who are newer. But we will ad­vise them and take care of them through­out,” Mr Ngiam said.</p>
    <p>Ms Phua is proud of her daugh­ter for com­ing up with the ini­tia­tive.</p>
    <p>“She is ob­ser­vant – merg­ing my hus­band’s in­ter­est with mine for</p>
    <p>this ini­tia­tive. She is al­ways think­ing of oth­ers. For ex­am­ple, she has also sug­gested us­ing her birth­day money to buy items for those in need,” said Ms Phua.</p>
    <p>“I re­ally feel like she’s grown up. When I was 11, I don’t think I would have done all this.”</p>
    <p>Ms Phua and Ashley will be fol­low­ing the cy­clists in a car with backup bi­cy­cles – in case of flat tyres or other is­sues – as well as wa­ter and pon­chos.</p>
    <p>Ashley will also help with the rice dis­tri­bu­tion next month.</p>
    <p>Ms Phua added that Keep­ing Hope Alive will be us­ing a new app to better serve ben­e­fi­cia­ries in the new year.</p>
    <p>The app, devel­oped by social en­ter­prise Fam­ily Spot­light, will help vol­un­teers keep better track of those in need by al­low­ing them to en­ter key in­for­ma­tion into a data­base.</p>
    <p>“This will also help oth­ers who want to con­trib­ute. For ex­am­ple, if you want to send liq­uid food to those who need to be tube-fed, then you can use the app to find out how many res­i­dents at this es­tate need to be tube-fed, and know how many items to pre­pare,” said Ms Phua.</p>
    <p>“Now, as more things go dig­i­tal, this is some­thing we need to do.”</p>
    <p>She is al­ways think­ing of oth­ers. For ex­am­ple, she has also sug­gested us­ing her birth­day money to buy items for those in need.</p>
    <p>MS FION PHUA, mother of 11-year-old Ashley Rao, who came up with the ini­tia­tive. Ms Phua is the founder of vol­un­teer plat­form Keep­ing Hope Alive.</p>
