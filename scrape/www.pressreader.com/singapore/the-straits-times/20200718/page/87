        11 | SATURDAY, JULY 18, 2020 SCHOLARS’ CHOICE: SECURE YOUR FUTURE NOW A captain of lives Ms Evelyn Loh helps transform lives at the Singapore Prison Service                              Expanding horizons A s someone who served as a prison officer, Ms Evelyn Loh, 32, believes in the power of second chances.
“Every offender is someone’s parent, sibling, spouse or child. When we transform offenders’ lives and help them to reintegrat­e back into their family and society, we build a better society and a safe Singapore,” she says of her experience as 2nd superinten­dent in the Singapore Prison Service’s (SPS) Tanah Merah Prison.
Her passion for her vocation began in her second year of junior college, when she visited the Kaki Bukit Centre (Prison School) as part of the Home Team Associates Programme and saw first-hand how some offenders were trying to turn over a new leaf.
Ms Loh recalls: “Some of them were almost as old as my dad, and they were pursuing their GCE ‘O’ Levels and ‘A’ Levels. They wanted a second chance in life.”
She says: “I also met prison officers who showed me what it means to be a captain of lives of the offenders who were under their charge. It was at that point that I knew I wanted to serve in the SPS.”
In her time as a prison officer, she remembers a female offender who reconciled with her father and vowed to complete her GCE ‘N’ Levels while in prison, so that she could take care of him after her release. She adds: “Years later, I bumped into her and her father and was heartened to see that they were both doing well.
“In this service, we always say that you’ll know you did a good job if you see ex-offenders in public and they come up to say hi to you. Such precious moments help to fuel my passion and purpose in this career.” Singapore Government Scholarshi­p After graduating from junior college, she studied for a bachelor’s degree in psychology at the University College London on a Singapore Government Scholarshi­p, before pursuing a master of science degree in decision sciences at the London School of Economics and Political Science.
She started working in the SPS in 2010, where she enjoyed several appointmen­ts and secondment­s that expanded her skillset and perspectiv­e.
As a housing unit officer in Changi Women’s Prison in 2011, she led a team of officers to manage the operations and rehabilita­tive programmes in one of the housing blocks for inmates.
During her time as a staff planning and developmen­t executive in the SPS Staff Developmen­t Division, she also analysed and developed strategies for the organisati­on’s workforce.
In 2015, she was seconded to the Ministry of Home Affairs’ Planning and Organisati­on Division as senior manager of resource planning. She examined the various capabiliti­es required for the Home Team Transforma­tion 2025 plan to transform policing, emergency response, drug control, correction­s and border security.
Two years later, another secondment to the Ministry of Social and Family Developmen­t’s ComCare and Social Support Division saw her take on the role of assistant director of financial security policy, where she helmed a team to develop and review policies to support low-income and vulnerable individual­s and families.
