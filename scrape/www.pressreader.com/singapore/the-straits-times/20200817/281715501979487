    <p>Health Min­istry files com­plaint against him after 240 cases linked to church led by him</p>
    <p>SEOUL • South Korea yes­ter­day ac­cused a con­ser­va­tive pas­tor of vi­o­lat­ing self-iso­la­tion rules and ob­struct­ing con­tact trac­ing at a church where 240 in­fec­tions have fu­elled the coun­try’s worst out­break in more than five months.</p>
    <p>The fo­cus on the Sarang Jeil Church, l ed by Rev­erend J un Kwang-hoon, re­vived bad mem­o­ries of the coun­try’s big­gest out­break, among fol­low­ers of a se­cre­tive Chris­tian sect back in Fe­bru­ary.</p>
    <p>South Korea re­ported 279 new cases yes­ter­day, its big­gest daily in­crease since early March, and more than dou­ble the 103 re­ported last Fri­day. Most of the new in­fec­tions were found in and around Seoul.</p>
    <p>The new cases bring the na­tion’s to­tal to 15,318, while the num­ber of fa­tal­i­ties re­mained at 305, ac­cord­ing to data from the Korea Cen­tres for Dis­ease Con­trol and Pre­ven­tion.</p>
    <p>Of­fi­cials said 245 of the new cases were in the Seoul, Gyeonggi and In­cheon re­gion – home to al­most half of the South Korean pop­u­la­tion.</p>
    <p>Aside from the in­fec­tions linked to the church, there were also smaller clus­ters, in­clud­ing some 30 cases linked to a Star­bucks out­let in the city of Paju, north of Seoul.</p>
    <p>The surge in Covid-19 cases prompted the au­thor­i­ties to reim­pose tighter so­cial dis­tanc­ing curbs in the Seoul metropoli­tan area yes­ter­day. The level two so­cial dis­tanc­ing alert, which will stay in ef­fect for the next two weeks, pro­hibits op­er­a­tions of “high-risk” fa­cil­i­ties, such as those al­low­ing spec­ta­tors at sport­ing events.</p>
    <p>“The re­cent cases in­di­cate that we are at an early stage of an­other wave of in­fec­tions, and if we don’t keep them un­der con­trol as much as pos­si­ble, it can lead to se­ri­ous con­se­quences such as na­tion­wide trans­mis­sions and a mas­sive hike in the num­ber of pa­tients,” Min­is­ter of Health Park Ne­ung-hoo said at a me­dia brief­ing yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The Health Min­istry said it had filed a com­plaint against Rev Jun, an out­spo­ken govern­ment critic, for vi­o­lat­ing self-iso­la­tion rules by par­tic­i­pat­ing in a rally on Satur­day, and for ob­struct­ing a med­i­cal in­ves­ti­ga­tion into the out­break by fail­ing to pro­vide a full list of church mem­bers for test­ing and trac­ing.</p>
    <p>Rev Jun’s church, Sarang Jeil Church, did not re­spond to phone calls seek­ing com­ment.</p>
    <p>On Satur­day, a Na­tional Lib­er­a­tion Day hol­i­day in both North and South Korea, thou­sands of de­mon­stra­tors par­tic­i­pated i n street protests against South Korean Pres­i­dent Moon Jae-in’s poli­cies, de­fy­ing a ban on ral­lies in the cap­i­tal Seoul.</p>
    <p>Pres­i­dent Moon said the lat­est out­break posed the coun­try’s big­gest chal­lenge to ef­forts to com­bat the coro­n­avirus since the large clus­ter of in­fec­tions traced to the Shin­cheonji Church of Je­sus, a se­cre­tive re­li­gious sect, six months ago.</p>
    <p>The South Korean au­thor­i­ties ar­rested the sect’s founder Lee Man­hee ear­lier this month for al­legedly hid­ing cru­cial in­for­ma­tion from con­tact trac­ers. The Shin­cheonji clus­ter fu­elled more than 5,000 Covid-19 in­fec­tions be­tween Fe­bru­ary and March, mak­ing South Korea the world’s sec­ond worst-hit by the virus at the time.</p>
    <p>Pres­i­dent Moon warned of “stern and strong mea­sures” against “some churches”, call­ing their be­hav­iour an “un­for­giv­able act that threat­ens pub­lic lives”.</p>
    <p>Of­fi­cials said 245 of the new cases were in the Seoul, Gyeonggi and In­cheon re­gion – home to al­most half of the South Korean pop­u­la­tion.</p>
