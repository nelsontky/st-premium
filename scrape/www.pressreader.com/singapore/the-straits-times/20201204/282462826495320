    <p>There were happy grins be­hind their face masks as swim­mers strode onto the deck at the OCBC Aquatic Cen­tre yes­ter­day to race in the Sin­ga­pore Na­tional Olympic Qual­i­fiers (SNOQ), the first com­pet­i­tive meet here in al­most a year.</p>
    <p>With Covid-19 wreak­ing havoc on the sports cal­en­dar, many of them had not com­peted since the Sin­ga­pore Swim Series I in Jan­uary. But their first day back on the blocks was far from nor­mal with strict safety mea­sures to ad­here to.</p>
    <p>Save for a group of so­cially-dis­tanced coaches, the aquatic cen­tre was mostly empty and quiet in the ab­sence of cheer­ing friends and fam­ily as the meet was held be­hind closed doors. All par­tic­i­pants were re­quired to wear a mask at all times ex­cept when in the wa­ter.</p>
    <p>The num­ber of com­peti­tors was also cut by more than half to about 300 swim­mers and tech­ni­cal of­fi­cials were re­duced from 30 to 14.</p>
    <p>For 800m freestyle swim­mer Gan Ching Hwee, what stood out at the meet was hav­ing to move quickly from one area to the next.</p>
    <p>“This new com­pe­ti­tion for­mat re­ally tests our adapt­abil­ity skills be­cause there are a lot of changes,” said the 17-year-old, who won two golds and a sil­ver at last year’s SEA Games.</p>
    <p>“Our warm-up tim­ing is a bit tight in the sense that we don’t have much time to sit around and rest. So once we change up we have to keep mov­ing to the next zone that we are al­lo­cated to.”</p>
    <p>While the ex­pe­ri­ence took some get­ting used to, Dono­van Lee was just happy to be back rac­ing.</p>
    <p>“It’s a bit dif­fer­ent, but as long as you fol­low the set or­ders, it isn’t that bad. I didn’t feel like I was very con­strained,” said the 20-year-old, who com­peted in the men’s 100m back­stroke.</p>
    <p>“It’s re­fresh­ing af­ter a few months off and it’s a step for­ward to next season.”</p>
    <p>Or­gan­ised by the Sin­ga­pore Swim­ming As­so­ci­a­tion, the SNOQ will give swim­mers the op­por­tu­nity to race and meet the Olympic qual­i­fy­ing times for the July 23-Aug 8 Tokyo Games.</p>
    <p>Meets such as the Sin­ga­pore Na­tional Swim­ming Age Group (Snag) Cham­pi­onships, Sin­ga­pore Na­tional Swim­ming Cham­pi­onships and other over­seas races were scrapped this year be­cause of the pan­demic, leav­ing few op­por­tu­ni­ties for ath­letes to com­pete.</p>
    <p>While yes­ter­day’s meet did not see any Olympic qual­i­fy­ing marks or na­tional records, a num­ber of the swim­mers are us­ing the event as a tune-up ahead of the next qual­i­fier, the Snag in March next year.</p>
    <p>Quah Ting Wen, who is hop­ing to qual­ify for her third Olympic Games, was pleased with her per­for­mance in the women’s 100m freestyle, where she fin­ished sec­ond in 56.42sec.</p>
    <p>Prior to the meet, she had only four days of train­ing in the pool as she was serv­ing a two-week quar­an­tine af­ter re­turn­ing from the In­ter­na­tional Swim­ming League in</p>
    <p>Hun­gary, where she had set short­course na­tional records in the 50m freestyle and 50m but­ter­fly.</p>
    <p>The 28-year-old is con­fi­dent that she can meet the Olympic A time, say­ing: “When March comes around and ev­ery­one’s tapered and well rested, we can move fast.</p>
    <p>“I swam well in Hun­gary, got a lot of the small de­tails that I’ve been work­ing on, so I’m ex­cited to see if I can trans­late that from short­course rac­ing to long course.”</p>
    <p>Quah will be back in ac­tion at the SNOQ to­day in the 100m but­ter­fly. Among the swim­mers aim­ing to earn their ticket to Tokyo are sprint spe­cial­ist Teong Tzen Wei, who will be com­pet­ing in the 100m fly, Glen Lim (400m free) and Christie Chue (100m breast­stroke).</p>

Covid-19 mea&#xAD;sures meant the swim&#xAD;mers had to move be&#xAD;tween al&#xAD;lo&#xAD;cated ar&#xAD;eas quickly.</p>
