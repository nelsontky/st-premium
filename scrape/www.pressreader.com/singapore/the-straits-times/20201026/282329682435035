    <p>And so it came to be that the cur­tain came down on Khabib Nur­magome­dov’s mixed mar­tial arts (MMA) ca­reer in an empty, silent arena in Abu Dhabi, in front of no spec­ta­tors, and in jar­ringly serene fash­ion.</p>
    <p>For a sport whose big­gest stars have built their pro­files not just on their skills but also by trash talk­ing and court­ing con­tro­versy – a la Conor McGre­gor – Nur­magome­dov’s dig­ni­fied exit comes across as a bit, well, odd.</p>
    <p>Emo­tional but some­how also tran­quil, the Rus­sian fighter ex­plained af­ter his win over Justin Gaethje at UFC 245 on Satur­day that he had made a prom­ise to his mother that the bout against the Amer­i­can would be his last. While Nur­magome­dov’s hand was forced in some ways, it also seems right.</p>
    <p>The 32-year-old is not leav­ing the cage for the last time on the back of a heart-wrench­ing de­feat, like heavy­weight great Daniel Cormier.</p>
    <p>He is not call­ing it in only af­ter a sad de­cline like for­mer light heavy­weight cham­pion Rashad Evans (five straight losses) or two-di­vi­sion cham­pion B.J. Penn (seven and count­ing).</p>
    <p>And there is no am­bi­gu­ity sur­round­ing his re­tire­ment, un­like Ge­orges St-Pierre, who re­tired for a sec­ond time last year and yet seems un­able to es­cape talk of a sec­ond come­back for a po­ten­tial “megafight” with some­one like Nur­magome­dov or McGre­gor.</p>
    <p>It also means he leaves his dom­i­nant record in the Oc­tagon to do the talk­ing for him. With 29 wins and no losses, he goes down as one of great­est MMA fighters of all time. But it’s not just about sta­tis­tics.</p>
    <p>While many have made their mark for be­ing knock­out artistes – Ge­orge Fore­man, Mike Tyson and Deon­tay Wilder in box­ing, and Fran­cis Ngan­nou in MMA – the MMA world had never re­ally seen any­body maul op­po­nents the way Nur­magome­dov did.</p>
    <p>He was nine when he fa­mously wres­tled a (well-fed and muz­zled) one-year-old bear and this, cou­pled with his early start in freestyle wrestling, judo and sambo, earned his grap­pling skills an al­most myth­i­cal rep­u­ta­tion.</p>
    <p>He backed it up in the cage. In his UFC de­but in 2012, he wiped the floor with Ka­mal Shalorus, a for­mer mem­ber of the Bri­tish Olympic freestyle wrestling team, and then de­feated Abel Tru­jillo, an Amer­i­can state col­lege wrestling cham­pion, af­ter tak­ing him down to the mat a record 21 times in three rounds.</p>
    <p>He then went through top-level op­po­nents – Brazil­ian jiu-jitsu black belt and fu­ture light­weight cham­pion Rafael dos An­jos, feared striker Ed­son Bar­boza, McGre­gor, and pre­tenders to his crown,</p>
    <p>Dustin Poirier and Gaethje – with ruth­less ef­fi­ciency.</p>
    <p>Away from the cage, he is a rar­ity in the sport, es­chew­ing the usual MMA fighter ten­dency to crow and brag, or goad op­po­nents, on so­cial me­dia. But his record still has one mas­sive blot fol­low­ing his in­fa­mous at­tack on McGre­gor’s cor­ner­man Dil­lon Da­nis af­ter his vic­tory over the Ir­ish­man at UFC 229 in 2018, when he fool­ishly de­cided to scale over the cage and launch him­self into the crowd.</p>
    <p>He was banned nine months and fined US$500,000 (S$ 679,000) for his ac­tions. How­ever, the in­ci­dent earned him more fans – he has over 23 mil­lion fol­low­ers on In­sta­gram – who felt he re­acted only af­ter be­ing pro­voked by McGre­gor’s jibes over his fam­ily and re­li­gion.</p>
    <p>De­spite their his­tory, the brash McGre­gor moved to of­fer his “re­spect and con­do­lences” af­ter his long-time ri­val’s an­nounce­ment at UFC 245, ap­pear­ing to draw a line un­der their feud.</p>
    <p>It is clear that aside from his un­par­al­leled dom­i­nance in the cage, the MMA world will surely miss Nur­magome­dov’s rare de­cency as well.</p>
    <p>Away from the cage, he is a rar­ity in the sport, es­chew­ing the usual MMA fighter ten­dency to crow and brag, or goad op­po­nents, on so­cial me­dia.</p>
