    <p>AU­DIO­BOOK THE SAND­MAN</p>
    <p>By Neil Gaiman</p>
    <p>DC Comics and Au­di­ble/ Au­dio­book/10h 54min/Avail­able from au­di­ble.com/Con­tains ex­plicit scenes and graphic vi­o­lence</p>
    <p>Trans­form­ing a graphic novel into an au­dio­book is al­ways a chal­lenge, let alone a beloved cult clas­sic like Neil Gaiman’s The Sand­man.</p>
    <p>To at­tempt this, Gaiman has joined forces with au­dio­book gi­ant Au­di­ble and a star-stud­ded voice cast in­clud­ing James McAvoy, Andy Serkis and Michael Sheen.</p>
    <p>It is an am­bi­tious ef­fort and the re­sult, while nowhere near per­fect, still adds a de­light­ful new di­men­sion to a mon­u­men­tal work.</p>
    <p>The Sand­man, a ground-break­ing se­ries first pub­lished by DC Comics in 1988, helped change the con­ver­sa­tion on whether comics qual­i­fied as lit­er­a­ture. It weaves myth, fan­tasy and hor­ror into a phan­tas­magor­i­cal ta­pes­try.</p>
    <p>It fol­lows Dream of the End­less, or Mor­pheus, the third of seven eter­nal sib­lings who are an­thro­po­mor­phic per­son­i­fi­ca­tions of hu­man ideas. Dream spends 70 years in cap­tiv­ity, mis­tak­enly trapped by oc­cultists who, crav­ing im­mor­tal­ity, sought to im­prison Dream’s el­der sis­ter Death.</p>
    <p>Upon his es­cape, Dream must re­store his ru­ined king­dom, re­cover his stray sub­jects and re­trieve his three tools of power: a pouch of sand, a helm sculpted from the bones of a dead god and a ruby.</p>
    <p>That is the sim­ple ver­sion of the plot. In fact, the story ranges far and wide through space, time and other di­men­sions, in­clud­ing a de­scent into hell, a se­rial-killer con­fer­ence and the pre­miere of Shake­speare’s play A Mid­sum­mer Night’s Dream, per­formed to the ac­tual fairy court.</p>
    <p>The au­dio­book cov­ers the first three vol­umes of The Sand­man – Pre­ludes And Noc­turnes, The Doll’s House and Dream Coun­try.</p>
    <p>It is al­most en­tirely faith­ful to the orig­i­nal in struc­ture and tone, striv­ing to fill in the gaps where vi­su­als would be with painstak­ing de­scrip­tion. It also pre­serves the vi­o­lence and sex­ual con­tent of the orig­i­nal. This should ab­so­lutely not be played for chil­dren.</p>
    <p>The au­dio­book is at best a com­ple­ment to the graphic novel, nei­ther sub­sti­tute nor re­work­ing. Gaiman does his best with the de­scrip­tions, but his prose pales in com­par­i­son to the stun­ning vis­tas and char­ac­ter de­sign by artists like Mike Drin­gen­berg.</p>
    <p>It is, nev­er­the­less, a lovely au­ral ex­pe­ri­ence. Di­rected by Dirk Maggs with a lav­ish sound­scape by James Han­ni­gan, it is nar­rated by Gaiman. The au­thor is not a pro­fes­sional vo­cal tal­ent, yet his mild, know­ing tones make for an unas­sum­ing guide through an of­ten dizzy­ing nar­ra­tive.</p>
    <p>McAvoy is a fan­tas­tic, lofty Mor­pheus, his reg­is­ter deep and sonorous for the most part – in the comic, Dream’s speech bub­bles are black with white text – but splin­ter­ing and splut­ter­ing in the Dream King’s pet­tier mo­ments.</p>
    <p>Many of the vil­lains are stand­outs, from a scenery-chew­ing Wil­liam Hope as the mega­lo­ma­ni­a­cal mad­man John Dee to the coiled menace of Riz Ahmed’s Corinthian, an es­caped night­mare-turned­se­rial killer with teeth for eyes.</p>
    <p>Sheen, fresh from play­ing the an­gel Azi­raphale in an­other Gaiman adap­ta­tion, the tele­vi­sion se­ries Good Omens (2019), trades sides to put in a brief but de­li­cious cameo as Lu­cifer, lord of hell.</p>
    <p>Lu­cifer’s char­ac­ter de­sign in the orig­i­nal comic is based on rock star David Bowie and Sheen pays vo­cal homage to that.</p>
    <p>Taron Eger­ton makes for an oddly perky John Con­stan­tine – one ex­pects more grit from the work­ing-class war­lock – and Kat Den­nings brings plenty of bub­bly but lit­tle grav­i­tas to Dream’s sis­ter Death, with her Amer­i­can twang painfully out of place in a scene in 1389 Lon­don.</p>
    <p>The strengths of the au­dio­book show in en­sem­ble scenes like the 24 hours in which John Dee uses Dream’s Ruby to take con­trol of a small-town diner and force its oc­cu­pants to com­mit acts of night­mar­ish de­prav­ity. Al­ready a vir­tu­osic se­quence of hor­ror on the page, it is ut­terly chill­ing to have in your ear.</p>
    <p>As au­dio­book adap­ta­tions go, The Sand­man sets the bar ter­ri­bly high. One can only hope the up­com­ing Net­flix adap­ta­tion is tak­ing notes.</p>
    <p>If you like this, lis­ten to: Lin­coln In The Bardo by Ge­orge Saunders (Au­di­ble Stu­dios for Blooms­bury, 2017, au­di­ble.com), the au­dio­book of the Booker Prize-win­ning novel about the ghosts of a post-Amer­i­can Civil War grave­yard. The 166-strong cast fea­tures celebri­ties such as Nick Of­fer­man, David Sedaris and Lena Dun­ham, as well as the au­thor and his fam­ily and friends.</p>
