    <p>An ac­coun­tant was so afraid that he would be re­trenched amid the Covid-19 pan­demic that he could not con­cen­trate at work, his pro­duc­tiv­ity plum­meted and he be­gan to suf­fer from anx­i­ety and in­som­nia.</p>
    <p>The sole bread­win­ner was wor­ried about hav­ing to pay the mort­gage while sup­port­ing two young chil­dren and his preg­nant wife, who even­tu­ally took him to see psy­chi­a­trist Seng Kok Han af­ter notic­ing her hus­band star­ing blankly at the com­puter.</p>
    <p>His plight is far from rare these days with more em­ploy­ees here re­port­ing high stress lev­els.</p>
    <p>Dr Seng, a con­sul­tant psy­chi­a­trist at No­bel Psy­cho­log­i­cal Well­ness Cen­tre, says he has seen about 20 per cent more pa­tients seek­ing help for work-re­lated stress in the last few months, and the num­bers could in­crease if the pan­demic drags on.</p>
    <p>A sur­vey by con­sul­tancy Mercer done be­tween July and Septem­ber found that 22 per cent of the 750 re­spon­dents here re­ported a high level of pres­sure since the pan­demic. Yet just 5 per cent said their stress lev­els were high be­fore the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>The sur­vey also noted that 74 per cent said they worked on rest days or be­yond reg­u­lar work hours.</p>
    <p>Dr Seng says the blur­ring of lines be­tween the work­place and home, which of­ten now dou­bles as an of­fice but may not be as con­ducive, can also be a key cause of pres­sure dur­ing this time. He cites one pa­tient who had to sit on the floor with his lap­top on a stool as there were other fam­ily mem­bers oc­cu­py­ing the only work space in the house.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore Hu­man Re­sources In­sti­tute (SHRI) pres­i­dent Low Peck Kem says the fear of los­ing one’s job has also been one of the ma­jor con­cerns for work­ers.</p>
    <p>“In this cur­rent cli­mate of higher un­em­ploy­ment, eco­nomic un­cer­tainty and flex­i­ble work ar­range­ments, the work­force is nat­u­rally stressed over job se­cu­rity, in­come se­cu­rity, how their jobs – if they are lucky enough to re­main em­ployed – might change...and whether they are skilled to be ready for those new roles,” she says.</p>
    <p>Men­tal health ad­vo­cate and former nom­i­nated MP Anthea Ong says work stress pre­dates the pan­demic. It can be in­duced by wor­ries that an em­ployee feels un­able to meet job de­mands or that their role lacks mean­ing or per­haps from con­cerns over re­la­tion­ships, which could arise from con­flict with col­leagues or from prej­u­dice or dis­crim­i­na­tion.</p>
