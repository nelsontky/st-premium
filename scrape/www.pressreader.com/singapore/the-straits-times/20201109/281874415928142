    <p>Since last year, US of­fi­cials have re­peat­edly ex­pressed con­cern that two China-funded projects in Cam­bo­dia are de­signed to give the Chi­nese mil­i­tary a foothold in South-east Asia.</p>
    <p>How cred­i­ble are these al­le­ga­tions and, if true, what might China and Cam­bo­dia gain from such an ar­range­ment?</p>
    <p>The two ar­eas of con­cern are both si­t­u­ated along Cam­bo­dia’s south-west coast.</p>
    <p>The first is Ream Naval Base in Preah Si­hanouk prov­ince. Cur­rently home to a hand­ful of small naval pa­trol craft be­long­ing to the Royal Cam­bo­dian Navy, the base is un­der­go­ing a ma­jor re­fur­bish­ment paid for by China.</p>
    <p>The base in­fra­struc­ture in­cluded sev­eral small build­ings, one of which was funded by the United States in 2012 and housed a mar­itime se­cu­rity cen­tre.</p>
    <p>In Jan­uary this year, Cam­bo­dia asked Amer­ica if it would pay to up­grade the build­ing. Washington agreed, but within a few months Cam­bo­dia had changed its mind and said it no longer needed US help be­cause China would pay for it in­stead. In Septem­ber, the mar­itime se­cu­rity cen­tre was re­lo­cated and the build­ing was de­mol­ished.</p>
    <p>The sec­ond site is far­ther up the coast at Dara Sakor in Koh Kong prov­ince. In 2008, a con­sor­tium of Chi­nese con­struc­tion com­pa­nies led by Union Devel­op­ment Group (UDG) ne­go­ti­ated a 99-year lease with the Cam­bo­dian govern­ment for 36,000ha of prime beach­front prop­erty at Dara Sakor. The area con­sti­tutes 20 per cent of the coun­try’s coast­line.</p>
    <p>The US$3.8 bil­lion (S$5.1 bil­lion) tourism, res­i­den­tial and in­dus­trial project is set to in­clude a deep wa­ter port and a 3.2km-long air­port run­way that can ac­com­mo­date most kinds of mil­i­tary air­craft. It has since be­come listed as one of China’s Belt and Road Ini­tia­tive projects.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to the US govern­ment, Ream Naval Base and the re­sort at Dara Sakor could be used as mil­i­tary lo­gis­tics fa­cil­i­ties by China’s Peo­ple’s Lib­er­a­tion Army (PLA). Sec­re­tary of State Mike Pom­peo has warned that if this were to hap­pen, it would “threaten Indo-Pa­cific sta­bil­ity”.</p>
    <p>In Septem­ber, the US im­posed sanc­tions on UDG, al­leg­ing the Chi­nese state-owned en­ter­prise had il­le­gally evicted Cam­bo­di­ans from their land and caused en­vi­ron­men­tal dam­age in a pro­tected na­tional park.</p>
    <p>WHAT THE CHI­NESE AND CAM­BO­DI­ANS SAY</p>
    <p>Cam­bo­dia has stren­u­ously de­nied that China is about to es­tab­lish a mil­i­tary foot­print in the coun­try.</p>
    <p>Prime Min­ster Hun Sen has re­jected as “fake news” West­ern me­dia reports al­leg­ing that China and Cam­bo­dia have signed a se­cret agree­ment which would al­low the PLA ac­cess to Ream for 30 years.</p>
    <p>He has pointed to the 1993 Cam­bo­dian Con­sti­tu­tion, which states that the coun­try “shall not au­tho­rise any for­eign mil­i­tary bases on its ter­ri­tory”, and said a Chi­nese mil­i­tary pres­ence would vi­o­late the coun­try’s neu­tral­ity, also en­shrined in the Con­sti­tu­tion.</p>
    <p>In­stead, Mr Hun Sen has pledged that once Ream Naval Base is up­graded, all for­eign navies will be wel­come to use it and that China will not be given ex­clu­sive ac­cess.</p>
    <p>China has also vig­or­ously de­nied that it wants to sta­tion the PLA in Cam­bo­dia.</p>
    <p>The con­tro­versy has a fa­mil­iar ring to it. Dur­ing the 1990s, press reports sug­gested that Chi­nese-built mil­i­tary fa­cil­i­ties in Myan­mar, in­clud­ing naval bases and sig­nals in­tel­li­gence lis­ten­ing posts, were manned by Chi­nese mil­i­tary per­son­nel. Yet there was never any ev­i­dence to sup­port these claims.</p>
    <p>This time, of course, the sit­u­a­tion is quite dif­fer­ent.</p>
    <p>China today has global in­ter­ests, and ac­cord­ing to a Pen­tagon re­port pub­lished in Septem­ber, Bei­jing is “seek­ing to es­tab­lish a more ro­bust over­seas lo­gis­tics and bas­ing in­fra­struc­ture to al­low the PLA to project and sus­tain mil­i­tary power at greater dis­tances” to pro­tect and ad­vance those in­ter­ests. China es­tab­lished its first over­seas mil­i­tary base in Dji­bouti in 2017.</p>
    <p>The re­port went on to de­scribe how over­seas Chi­nese mil­i­tary fa­cil­i­ties could be used by the PLA to sup­port mil­i­tary op­er­a­tions dur­ing armed con­flict, pro­vide strate­gic sig­nalling, con­duct train­ing and ex­er­cises with other coun­tries and mon­i­tor US forces.</p>
    <p>It sug­gested that the PLA had “likely con­sid­ered” lo­ca­tions for mil­i­tary lo­gis­tics fa­cil­i­ties in In­done­sia, Myan­mar, Sin­ga­pore and Thai­land, but sin­gled out Cam­bo­dia in par­tic­u­lar.</p>
    <p>If US con­cerns are cor­rect, and China does want to for­ward de­ploy the PLA to Cam­bo­dia, what strate­gic ad­van­tages would it gain?</p>
    <p>STRATE­GIC AD­VAN­TAGES FOR CHINA</p>
    <p>Ream and Dara Sakor face the Gulf of Thai­land, and Chi­nese war­ships de­ployed there would be within a day’s sail­ing time to the strate­gi­cally im­por­tant Strait of Malacca, through which most of China’s en­ergy im­ports pass. Chi­nese an­a­lysts have long con­sid­ered the Strait of Malacca to be a strate­gic vul­ner­a­bil­ity. Hav­ing war­ships nearby to pro­tect Chi­nese ship­ping might ease Bei­jing’s en­ergy in­se­cu­rity.</p>
    <p>A Chi­nese mil­i­tary pres­ence in Cam­bo­dia would be of lit­tle value in ad­vanc­ing Bei­jing’s ex­pan­sive claims in the South China Sea given that it has al­ready con­structed large mil­i­tary bases on its seven ar­ti­fi­cial is­lands in the Spratlys.</p>
    <p>But it would pro­vide a very use­ful pres­sure point against Viet­nam. Dur­ing a Sino-Viet­namese cri­sis over the dis­puted atolls, Bei­jing could en­gage in strate­gic mes­sag­ing by send­ing war­ships and mil­i­tary air­craft to Cam­bo­dia as a warn­ing to Hanoi.</p>
    <p>What would Cam­bo­dia gain? Pre­sum­ably the pri­mary ad­van­tage for the Hun Sen govern­ment would be mone­tary, in the form of fees paid for berthing and land­ing rights or fi­nan­cial aid.</p>
    <p>But Mr Hun Sen must also weigh up the po­ten­tial risks.</p>
    <p>COSTS FOR CAM­BO­DIA</p>
    <p>The pres­ence of for­eign mil­i­tary forces is in­vari­ably a source of</p>
    <p>con­tro­versy do­mes­ti­cally, and PLA as­sets in Cam­bo­dia would al­most cer­tainly be­come a light­ning rod for crit­i­cism against Mr Hun Sen. On Oct 23, po­lice broke up a protest out­side China’s em­bassy in Ph­nom Penh against al­leged plans by China to sta­tion the PLA in Cam­bo­dia.</p>
    <p>The pres­ence of PLA forces in Cam­bo­dia would also deal a body blow to bi­lat­eral re­la­tions with Viet­nam. De­spite Mr Hun Sen’s close re­la­tions with China, he has al­ways been care­ful to nur­ture cor­dial po­lit­i­cal ties with Hanoi.</p>
    <p>And as Sino-US strate­gic ri­valry es­ca­lates in South-east Asia, some of Cam­bo­dia’s fel­low Asean mem­bers would also look askance at a Chi­nese mil­i­tary fa­cil­ity in Cam­bo­dia.</p>
    <p>For the mo­ment, China’s plans for Ream Naval Base and Dara Sakor re­main ob­scure. But a Dji­bouti-style Chi­nese mil­i­tary base in Cam­bo­dia seems un­likely, and not some­thing that a wily states­man like Mr Hun Sen would ac­qui­esce to.</p>
    <p>More likely is that once the fa­cil­i­ties are com­pleted at these two lo­ca­tions, the Chi­nese navy and air force will be an oc­ca­sional vis­i­tor. In a geopo­lit­i­cal cri­sis, how­ever, the PLA might have the op­tion of stay­ing longer.</p>
