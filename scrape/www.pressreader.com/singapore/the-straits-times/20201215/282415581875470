    <p>• Jurgen Klopp had to wake Liver­pool up be­fore Mo­hamed Salah’s late penalty res­cued a 1-1 Premier League draw against strug­gling Ful­ham on Sun­day.</p>
    <p>Klopp’s side were pun­ished for a sloppy first-half dis­play at Craven Cot­tage when Bobby Decor­dovaReid gave the hosts a shock lead.</p>
    <p>But Egyp­tian star Salah spared the vis­i­tors’ blushes with a penalty 11 min­utes from time to pre­serve their eight-game un­beaten run in the top flight.</p>
    <p>The Premier League cham­pi­ons missed the chance to leapfrog lead­ers Tot­ten­ham, who drew 1-1 at Crys­tal Palace, and re­mained sec­ond on goal dif­fer­ence.</p>
    <p>Their un­char­ac­ter­is­ti­cally lax per­for­mance left Klopp rag­ing.</p>
    <p>“If they had to wake up, I don’t know, but I can­not write a book and throw it on the pitch for them to read,” he said af­ter his side failed to win an away league game for the fifth straight time.</p>
    <p>“I wanted us to shake up the game. A good start is nice, but if you don’t have it, you start again. We had half an hour pretty much to get our feet in the game, and that’s why I shouted a bit at them.</p>
    <p>“Af­ter that, it was bet­ter and the sec­ond half was good. They were fight­ing for the re­sult but we had more sit­u­a­tions af­ter that and could have scored more.”</p>
    <p>The Reds will have a chance to go top when they host Spurs to­mor­row.</p>
    <p>With Diogo Jota now ruled out for two months, their in­jury cri­sis is not let­ting up but Joel Matip, who was taken off early at Ful­ham, is ex­pected to be fit to face Jose Mour­inho’s men.</p>
    <p>“Joel has a spasm in his back. We will see,” Klopp said. “I think there will be a chance for Wed­nes­day.</p>
    <p>“It’s not that bad at the mo­ment. You have to fight against it, and that’s what the boys did. We move on. Tot­ten­ham is the next chal­lenge.”</p>
    <p>Like Klopp, Spurs man­ager Mour­inho also rued let­ting two points slip at Sel­hurst Park af­ter his play­ers “did the ex­act op­po­site” of what he told them to do.</p>
    <p>Spurs, whose 1-1 draw stretched their un­beaten league run to 11 games, had looked on course for their fifth away win af­ter Harry Kane’s opener, only to be pegged back by Jef­frey Schlupp’s late equaliser.</p>
