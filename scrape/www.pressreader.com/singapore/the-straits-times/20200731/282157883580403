    <p>(-57.88) July 30</p>
    <p>As the im­pact of the Covid-19 out­break be­comes clearer, with more com­pa­nies post­ing earn­ings de­clines and misses, the Straits Times In­dex (STI) yes­ter­day fell 43.63 points or 1.7 per cent to 2,529.82.</p>
    <p>Losers out­num­bered gain­ers 289 to 184, on turnover of 1.99 bil­lion shares worth $2.97 bil­lion.</p>
    <p>The STI is down 1.9 per cent over this short trad­ing week.</p>
    <p>Among the top losers was Sin­ga­pore Air­lines, which has im­ple­mented more mea­sures to slash costs, in­clud­ing big­ger pay cuts for its bosses, a 10 per cent salary re­duc­tion for other staff, and early re­tire­ment for pi­lots and ground staff.</p>
    <p>The car­rier’s shares ex­tended their de­cline, los­ing 3.12 per cent to $3.42 yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The best per­former on the in­dex was Dairy Farm In­ter­na­tional, which rose 3.13 per cent to US$4.28, de­spite re­port­ing a 35 per cent drop in net profit to US$115 mil­lion (S$158.2 mil­lion) in its first half.</p>
    <p>An­a­lysts re­main pos­i­tive on it, how­ever. DBS Group Re­search has kept its “buy” rating on the stock, cit­ing its at­trac­tive valu­a­tion and on­go­ing trans­for­ma­tion that re­mains “well on track”.</p>
    <p>The most ac­tive counter of the day was Thai Bev­er­age, which added 1.59 per cent to $0.64, with 125.4 mil­lion shares chang­ing hands.</p>
    <p>Ear­lier this week, JPMor­gan put out a re­search report on Thai con­sumer com­pa­nies, say­ing that it ex­pected a bet­ter show­ing for those sell­ing sta­ples ver­sus dis­cre­tionary items, but it was “over­weight” on ThaiBev due to its “suf­fi­cient valu­a­tion dis­count”.</p>
    <p>Re­gional mar­kets were a sea of red on the back of con­tin­ued coro­n­avirus wor­ries.</p>
    <p>At the same time, risk sen­ti­ment was buoyed after the US Fed­eral Re­serve kept its pol­icy set­ting un­changed, while pledg­ing it would use its full range of tools, if needed.</p>
    <p>Ja­pan’s bench­mark Nikkei 225 dipped 0.26 per cent, ex­tend­ing its los­ing streak for a fifth trad­ing day.</p>
    <p>“Sen­ti­ment sagged after news about fresh busi­ness re­stric­tions in Tokyo hit the mar­ket,” IwaiCosmo Se­cu­ri­ties’ bro­ker Toshikazu Ho­ri­uchi told Agence France-Presse, adding: “In­vestors were also con­cerned about record in­fec­tion num­bers in Tokyo.”</p>
    <p>Hong Kong’s Hang Seng In­dex fell 0.69 per cent, and China’s bench­mark Shang­hai Com­pos­ite In­dex re­treated 0.23 per cent</p>
    <p>South Korea’s Kospi In­dex closed up 0.17 per cent – reach­ing its high­est in six months amid con­tin­ued strong for­eign in­vestor buying.</p>
    <p>Malaysia’s KLCI lost 0.48 per cent and Aus­tralia’s S&P/ASX 200 closed 0.74 per cent higher.</p>
