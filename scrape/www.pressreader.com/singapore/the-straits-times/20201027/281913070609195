    <p>Ama­zon chief ex­ec­u­tive Jeff Be­zos is squar­ing up against Re­liance In­dus­tries founder Mukesh</p>
    <p>Am­bani over the In­dian re­tailer Fu­ture Group, draw­ing bat­tle lines be­tween two of the world’s rich­est men over the coun­try’s lu­cra­tive e-com­merce mar­ket.</p>
    <p>On Sun­day, the Sin­ga­pore In­ter­na­tional Ar­bi­tra­tion Cen­tre granted an emer­gency in­terim order in Ama­zon’s favour, af­ter the US tech group filed a com­plaint con­nected to a US$3.4 bil­lion (S$4.6 bil­lion) deal that Re­liance struck with Fu­ture Group in</p>
    <p>Au­gust.</p>
    <p>Ama­zon, which ac­quired an in­di­rect mi­nor­ity stake in the re­tail and fash­ion con­glom­er­ate last year, al­leged that Fu­ture’s sale of its re­tail, whole­sale, lo­gis­tics and ware­hous­ing busi­nesses to Re­liance breached its pre-ex­ist­ing con­tract, which in­cluded a right of first of­fer and a non-com­pete clause.</p>
    <p>The deal is now on hold un­til a fi­nal de­ci­sion is given.</p>
    <p>The le­gal fight comes as Ama­zon and Re­liance are set to go head to head in a bat­tle for dom­i­nance in In­dia’s boom­ing e-com­merce mar­ket, which will be worth US$86 bil­lion by 2024, ac­cord­ing to re­search firm For­rester.</p>
    <p>The stakes are par­tic­u­larly high for Ama­zon, which be­lieves In­dia is a big growth mar­ket af­ter shut­ting its on­line store in China last year.</p>
    <p>Re­liance, which is al­ready In­dia’s big­gest off­line re­tailer, with more than 11,000 stores and rev­enues of US$18.5 bil­lion last year, has a small pres­ence in e-com­merce. But it is em­bark­ing on a strat­egy to dis­lodge Ama­zon and Wal­mart-owned Flip­kart, which to­gether con­trol about 70 per cent of the on­line mar­ket in In­dia.</p>
    <p>Af­ter rais­ing US$20 bil­lion from global in­vestors for Re­liance Jio, his tele­com and dig­i­tal ser­vices busi­ness, Mr Am­bani has since be­gun an­other fundrais­ing blitz for his re­tail arm. Rais­ing more than US$5 bil­lion from mar­quee back­ers so far, his vi­sion is to digi­tise Re­liance Re­tail and its enor­mous off­line net­work.</p>
    <p>“Now, with the kind of fund­ing Re­liance has got, it’s ev­i­dent that they will play in the same mar­kets as Ama­zon and Flip­kart,” said Bern­stein’s Rahul Mal­ho­tra in Mumbai. “This is the start of a more com­pet­i­tive era.”</p>
    <p>‘AM­BANI IS AF­TER WHAT BE­ZOS HAS GOT’</p>
    <p>The bat­tle over Fu­ture Re­tail comes as Ama­zon and Flip­kart are seek­ing part­ner­ships with bricks-and-mor­tar re­tail­ers in In­dia, part of a push to ex­pand while com­ply­ing with new reg­u­la­tions lim­it­ing for­eign play­ers in the e-com­merce sec­tor.</p>
    <p>Ama­zon, Re­liance and Fu­ture Group de­clined to com­ment for this ar­ti­cle.</p>
    <p>The skir­mish is the lat­est set­back for Mr Be­zos in In­dia af­ter a high-pro­file trip in Jan­uary flopped, with the com­merce min­is­ter say­ing that the Ama­zon head’s pledge to invest US$1 bil­lion to digi­tise small and medium-sized busi­nesses across the coun­try was no “great favour to In­dia”.</p>
    <p>Mr Be­zos – who has in­vested bil­lions in In­dia since start­ing op­er­a­tions there in 2013 – had been un­able to se­cure a meet­ing with Prime Min­is­ter Naren­dra Modi when he came to New Delhi, said a per­son close to Ama­zon. Mr Be­zos later had break­fast with Mr Am­bani and other in­dus­tri­al­ists in Mumbai.</p>
    <p>“They are big ri­vals, ob­vi­ously. Am­bani is af­ter what Be­zos has got,” said a Mumbai banker. “A typ­i­cal mid­dle-class In­dian kid wants to shop on­line and he thinks of Ama­zon, he doesn’t think of Re­liance Re­tail or JioMart,” he said, re­fer­ring to Re­liance’s on­line gro­cery de­liv­ery store.</p>
    <p>De­spite on-and-off talks this year over the pos­si­bil­ity of Ama­zon tak­ing a stake in Re­liance Re­tail, an­a­lysts said Mr Be­zos was wary of form­ing a part­ner­ship with the pow­er­ful In­dian ty­coon.</p>
    <p>Mr Am­bani, too, was re­luc­tant to hand over any ma­jor­ity stake or con­trol to his ri­val, peo­ple close to Re­liance said, hin­der­ing any gen­uine ef­fort to make a deal.</p>
    <p>Mr Am­bani has been a mag­net for in­vest­ment as he seeks to trans­form his en­ergy con­glom­er­ate into a home-grown tech su­per­power. He has made no se­cret of his plans to make Jio Plat­forms the next In­ter­net gi­ant.</p>
    <p>“Jio wants the max­i­mum amount of house­hold spend­ing to come to them,” said Mr Satish Meena, a New Delhi-based an­a­lyst at For­rester. “They are do­ing the same thing that they did with tele­com, and if they are able to con­trol gro­cery pur­chases, they have cap­tured the ma­jor­ity of house­hold spend­ing.”</p>
    <p>Fu­ture op­er­ates some of In­dia’s most high-pro­file re­tail brands, such as su­per­mar­ket chain Big Bazaar and pre­mium gro­cery shop Food­hall. If Re­liance’s tie-up with the group goes through, Mr Am­bani’s em­pire would con­trol 40 per cent of the coun­try’s for­mal gro­cery mar­ket.</p>
    <p>‘WHY SHOULD A FOR­EIGN COM­PANY DOM­I­NATE?’</p>
    <p>De­spite lag­ging be­hind Ama­zon and Flip­kart in its on­line user ex­pe­ri­ence, Re­liance has the ad­van­tage of be­ing on the right side of a grow­ing tide of pro­tec­tion­ist poli­cies in In­dia, an­a­lysts say.</p>
    <p>“In Mumbai busi­ness cir­cles, Ama­zon is viewed as the new East In­dia Com­pany of sorts,” one per­son close to Re­liance said, re­fer­ring to the pri­vate Bri­tish cor­po­ra­tion that ruled large swathes of the In­dian sub­con­ti­nent in the 18th cen­tury. “Why should a for­eign com­pany dom­i­nate when we have home-grown gi­ants – from Am­bani to Tata and Birla?”</p>
    <p>The shift­ing e-com­merce reg­u­la­tions in the coun­try have raised fa­mil­iar ques­tions over New Delhi’s treat­ment of its big­gest for­eign in­vestors, with Voda­fone spend­ing years fight­ing a €3 bil­lion (S$4.8 bil­lion) tax dis­pute with the In­dian au­thor­i­ties re­lated to an ac­qui­si­tion of a lo­cal op­er­a­tor.</p>
    <p>Af­ter Wal­mart paid US$16 bil­lion for Flip­kart in 2018 – the largest sin­gle for­eign in­vest­ment in the coun­try – New Delhi changed its rules for the sec­tor just months later, ban­ning for­eign com­pa­nies from keep­ing their own in­ven­tory and al­low­ing them only to op­er­ate as on­line “mar­ket­places” con­nect­ing sellers to buy­ers.</p>
    <p>To work around these rules, Ama­zon and Flip­kart have been pick­ing up stakes in In­dian re­tail­ers to deepen their sup­ply chains. Ama­zon holds stakes in depart­ment store Shop­pers Stop and gro­cery chain More, part of the Aditya Birla Group. Flip­kart an­nounced last Fri­day that it paid US$200 mil­lion for a 7.8 per cent stake in Aditya Birla Fash­ion and Re­tail Lim­ited, which has more than 3,000 stores in the coun­try.</p>
    <p>The out­come of Ama­zon’s le­gal bat­tle with Fu­ture was dif­fi­cult to pre­dict, an­a­lysts said. Re­liance said in a state­ment it “in­tends to en­force its rights and com­plete the trans­ac­tion in terms of the scheme and agree­ment with Fu­ture group with­out any de­lay”.</p>
    <p>At the very least, how­ever, the ar­bi­tra­tion would buy the United States group some time, said Mr Neil Shah, an­a­lyst at Counterpoi­nt in Mumbai. “Ama­zon might put a span­ner in the wheel to try and slow down the Re­liance ex­pan­sion,” said Mr Shah.</p>
    <p>“But Re­liance is mak­ing big moves and is a big threat. The ball is in Mr Am­bani’s court.”</p>
    <p>De­spite on-and-off talks this year over the pos­si­bil­ity of Ama­zon tak­ing a stake in Re­liance Re­tail, an­a­lysts said Mr Jeff Be­zos (left) was wary of form­ing a part­ner­ship with the pow­er­ful In­dian ty­coon. Mr Mukesh Am­bani, too, was re­luc­tant to hand over any ma­jor­ity stake or con­trol to his ri­val, peo­ple close to Re­liance said, hin­der­ing any gen­uine ef­fort to make a deal.</p>
