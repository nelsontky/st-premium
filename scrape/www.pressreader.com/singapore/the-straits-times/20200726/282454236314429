    <p>Talk to enough pas­try chefs and you start to re­alise they have one trait in com­mon – a sharp at­ten­tion to de­tail. Not for them vague terms like “a heap­ing tea­spoon”.</p>
    <p>That ob­ses­sive­ness is what gives Lev­elled, started last month by Mr Cheong Qing Da, 30, and Ms Michelle Tan, 28, its name.</p>
    <p>Mr Cheong says: “The ini­tials for Michelle’s Chi­nese name, Tan Su Ping, are tsp or tea­spoon. She is so care­ful when she bakes and en­sures she al­ways lev­els her bak­ing spoon mea­sure­ments. And we re­ally like how it gives a sense of ground­ed­ness and hu­mil­ity, to be lev­elled.”</p>
    <p>That ex­tends to other parts of their lives. Both have day jobs. He is a barista and sales and re­la­tion­ship man­ager for a whole­sale cof­fee bean sup­plier. She is an op­er­a­tions man­ager for a dig­i­tal air­port plat­form com­pany and trained in culi­nary and cater­ing man­age­ment at Te­masek Polytech­nic.</p>
    <p>All their free time is de­voted to the busi­ness and they of­fer tast­ing boxes of cane­les and brown­ies, pack­aged in boxes that seem cre­ated for their bakes, so snugly do the wares fill them.</p>
    <p>The cane­les come i n matcha, choco­late and vanilla and they have per­fected the recipe for max­i­mum In­sta­gram im­pact. Cut through the crisp ex­te­rior and the in­side is cus­tardy. Then, the matcha cream or choco­late ganache starts to ooze.</p>
    <p>Re­cently, they de­buted truf­fle cane­les us­ing Man­jimup black truf­fles from Aus­tralia.</p>
    <p>Their dark choco­late brown­ies are stuffed, with peanut but­ter and jelly, Nutella, Ovo­ma­l­tine or cookie but­ter, yield­ing a built-in smile when you cut each one in half.</p>
    <p>Like the oth­ers, they had some anx­i­ety when they started.</p>
    <p>Ms Tan says: “We were wor­ried cane­les would not be well-re­ceived in the lo­cal mar­ket as it has a deep caramelise­d ex­te­rior with a cus­tardy in­te­rior. Our cane­les can be eas­ily mis­un­der­stood as charred. Also, we were con­cerned that what we like might not be what the lo­cal palate is ac­cus­tomed to.”</p>
    <p>Those fears have van­ished, and they are now work­ing flat out to get their boxes to peo­ple on their wait­list, now with “slightly over” 1,000 peo­ple on it. They sell out within a minute when the or­der­ing win­dow opens at 8pm on Tues­days.</p>
    <p>“We re­cently made the de­ci­sion to ded­i­cate all our pub­lic hol­i­days to the wait list, so we can reach out to more lovely peo­ple pa­tiently wait­ing for a tast­ing box,” says Ms Tan.</p>
    <p>They both say they would like to open a shop on the fringes of the Cen­tral Busi­ness District, “some­where a lit­tle hip, but in a very charm­ing neigh­bour­hood”.</p>
    <p>Their gam­ble to of­fer cane­les, which is shap­ing up to be the new pas­try ob­ses­sion in Sin­ga­pore, has paid off in spades. Mr Cheong says: “The ma­jor­ity of Sin­ga­pore con­sumers are so well-trav­elled and re­cep­tive to new and in­ter­est­ing pas­tries. They also ap­pre­ci­ate qual­ity and can taste the dif­fer­ence.”</p>
