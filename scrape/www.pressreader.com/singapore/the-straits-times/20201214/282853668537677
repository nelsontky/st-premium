    <p>Aries (March 21 - April 19)</p>
    <p>Your need for cul­ture is strong, which could mean you need to get out there and hit a mu­seum or cre­ate some­thing new on your own.</p>
    <p>Taurus (April 20 - May 20)</p>
    <p>Your deep­est mind is ac­tive, so make sure you have what it takes to de­code its mes­sages. It could mean a dream glossary or some­thing more ar­cane.</p>
    <p>Gemini (May 21 - June 20)</p>
    <p>This is not a good time for you to stick to your guns. You should lis­ten to op­pos­ing views as dog­ma­tists never get any­where.</p>
    <p>Can­cer (June 21 - July 22)</p>
    <p>You need to fo­cus on help­ing oth­ers – things are not mak­ing much sense. You should be fine af­ter a few days, but rack up good karma in the mean­time.</p>
    <p>Leo (July 23 - Aug 22)</p>
    <p>Your gen­eros­ity is lim­it­less, so make sure the right peo­ple are in your path. You want to give what you can to those who deserve it most.</p>
    <p>Virgo (Aug 23 - Sept 22)</p>
    <p>Do not go against the cur­rent – things are go­ing well, but that is only true as long as you are go­ing with the flow and let­ting the world be your guide.</p>
    <p>Libra (Sept 23 - Oct 22)</p>
    <p>Your men­tal en­ergy helps you ex­plore new ideas and con­cepts – so put aside time for re­search, med­i­ta­tion or what­ever it takes to get you there.</p>
    <p>Scorpio (Oct 23 - Nov 21)</p>
    <p>That deal is too good to be true, so let some­one else take the fall for you. You could also warn him about it if you want to earn your wings.</p>
    <p>Sagittariu­s (Nov 22 - Dec 21)</p>
    <p>You can count on your friends to help you out, even though you may not know you need it. Just go about your busi­ness and ex­pect the best.</p>
    <p>Capricorn (Dec 22 - Jan 19)</p>
    <p>Your abil­ity to suc­ceed is de­ter­mined by your per­se­ver­ance. As long as you keep at it, you should be fine. Do not give up, no mat­ter how hope­less things feel.</p>
    <p>Aquarius (Jan 20 - Feb 18)</p>
    <p>You should in­tro­duce your­self to some­one new – he may turn out to be an im­por­tant mem­ber of your team at work or in the neigh­bour­hood.</p>
    <p>Pisces (Feb 19 - March 20)</p>
    <p>You need to think be­fore you speak. Things will get bet­ter soon as long as you can find a way to keep from of­fend­ing any­one im­por­tant.</p>
