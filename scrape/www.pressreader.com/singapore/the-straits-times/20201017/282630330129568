    <p>LOS AN­GE­LES • Amer­i­can rap­per Post Malone was the big­gest win­ner with nine awards at the 2020 Bill­board Mu­sic Awards on Wed­nes­day night.</p>
    <p>The long-de­layed cer­e­mony was held at Hol­ly­wood’s Dolby Theatre in Los An­ge­les with no au­di­ence, the lat­est show to go semi-virtual due to Covid-19 pro­to­cols. The event, hosted by singer Kelly Clark­son, was ini­tially sched­uled to take place in April in Las Ve­gas.</p>
    <p>Post Malone led with 16 nom­i­na­tions this year, fol­lowed by Lil Nas X with 13.</p>
    <p>The 25-year-old top nom­i­nee took home nine tro­phies, in­clud­ing Top Artist, Top Male Artist and Top Rap Al­bum for Hol­ly­wood’s Bleed­ing.</p>
    <p>Another big win­ner was singer Khalid, who clinched five awards, in­clud­ing Top R&B Artist, Top R&B Al­bum for Free Spirit and Top R&B Song for Talk.</p>
    <p>Lil Nas X won four awards, for Top Hot 100 Song, Top Stream­ing Song, Top Sell­ing Song and Top Rap Song for his hit sin­gle Old Town Road.</p>
    <p>The Top Fe­male Artist went to teenage singer Bil­lie Eil­ish, who also won Top New Artist and Top Bill­board 200 Al­bum for When We All Fall Asleep, Where Do We Go?.</p>
    <p>K-pop boy band BTS won the Top So­cial Artist award, while the Top Duo/Group went to the Jonas Brothers, who also won Top Ra­dio Songs Artist and Top Ra­dio Song for Sucker.</p>
    <p>There was a heart­felt per­for­mance by singer John Leg­end. He ded­i­cated the song Never Break to his wife, model Chrissy Teigen, who suf­fered a mis­car­riage re­cently.</p>
    <p>Ranked as one of the most im­por­tant mu­sic shows of the year in the United States, the Bill­board Mu­sic Awards are given out an­nu­ally by Bill­board, a pub­li­ca­tion and mu­sic pop­u­lar­ity chart cov­er­ing the mu­sic busi­ness.</p>
    <p>The win­ners are se­lected based on their per­for­mance on the Bill­board Charts. XIN­HUA</p>
