    <p>Span­ish vet­eran Feli­ciano Lopez has said that the vastly re­duced prize money on of­fer for ten­nis players is the “best we can have” after set­ting up a Paris Mas­ters sec­ond-round tie against Rafael Nadal.</p>
    <p>The fi­nal ATP Mas­ters event of the sea­son started at Bercy Arena on Mon­day be­hind closed doors, just days after France be­gan a sec­ond coro­n­avirus lock­down.</p>
    <p>The win­ner of this tour­na­ment will pocket just over 20 per­cent of the €995,720 (S$1.58 mil­lion) win­ner’s cheque that 2019 cham­pion No­vak Djokovic took home.</p>
    <p>“I want to be clear. I think this is... the best we can have right now,” Lopez said after his 7-6 (13-11), 6-1 first-round win over Filip Kra­ji­novic on Mon­day.</p>
    <p>“We have to be aware of the sit­u­a­tion that the world is liv­ing and how ev­ery­one is fac­ing these chal­leng­ing times around the world.</p>
    <p>“For now, I don’t see any hope on prize money. I think it will stay the same for a while.”</p>
    <p>Paris Mas­ters tour­na­ment di­rec­tor Guy For­get has said that the event had been helped fi­nan­cially by the other Mas­ters se­ries events and the ATP Tour.</p>
    <p>Or­gan­is­ers were ex­pect­ing to wel­come 1,000 fans each day to Bercy Arena, but in­stead had to re­fund the tick­ets after French Pres­i­dent Em­manuel Macron’s de­cree.</p>
    <p>But Lopez, the tour­na­ment di­rec­tor of the Madrid Open, which was axed ear­lier this year due to the cri­sis, ad­mit­ted that players should count them­selves lucky to be able to play. The ATP and WTA Tours were suspended be­tween March and Au­gust this year.</p>
    <p>Lopez, 39, will face Nadal to­day in his com­pa­triot’s first match since win­ning a record-ex­tend­ing 13th French Open ti­tle and record­e­qualling 20th Grand Slam crown last month. The world No. 64 has beaten sec­ond-ranked Nadal on four oc­ca­sions, in­clud­ing in each of their last two meet­ings.</p>
    <p>In yes­ter­day’s first-round matches, 2018 cham­pion Karen Khachanov, the only for­mer win­ner in the draw with Djokovic ab­sent, lost 6-3, 2-6, 6-2 to qual­i­fier Ale­jan­dro Davi­dovich Fok­ina.</p>
    <p>Three-time Slam win­ner Stan Wawrinka beat Britain’s Dan Evans 6-3, 7-6 (7-3), while 2014 US Open cham­pion Marin Cilic de­feated Felix Auger Alias­sime 6-0, 3-6, 6-3.</p>
