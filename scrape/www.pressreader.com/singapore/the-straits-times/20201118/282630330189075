    <p>SEOUL • Do not try this at home.</p>
    <p>South Korean va­ri­ety show Running Man was slammed for be­ing “sadis­tic” af­ter it made celebri­ties play a game in­volv­ing rub­ber bands.</p>
    <p>In its lat­est episode on Sun­day, cast mem­bers and guests had to wrap as many rub­ber bands as pos­si­ble round their faces i n one minute. Many looked to be gri­mac­ing in pain dur­ing the game.</p>
    <p>The game i nvolved ac­tresses Song Ji-hyo and Jeon So-min, co­me­dian Yang Se-chan, and K-pop group Seven­teen’s Mingyu and Hoshi.</p>
    <p>Yang was the first to try the game. He said it was more painful than he had thought as he wrapped rub­ber bands around his face.</p>
    <p>Song and Jeon were up next, with Jeon say­ing that she felt that her eyes were go­ing to pop out.</p>
    <p>Jeon even­tu­ally won the game with 36 rub­ber bands around her face, while Song had 33 rub­ber bands and Yang had 30.</p>
    <p>The game met with a tor­rent of crit­i­cism on­line, as some ne­ti­zens called the game “cruel” while oth­ers said it was dan­ger­ous and could in­jure the celebri­ties.</p>
    <p>Other view­ers were con­cerned that young­sters and chil­dren may try out the game too and called for it to be re­moved af­ter scenes of peo­ple play­ing the game were seen in the trailer for the next episode.</p>
    <p>The TV sta­tion and pro­duc­ers in­volved have so far not is­sued any re­sponse to such calls.</p>
