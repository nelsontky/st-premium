    <p>De­spite de­scrib­ing her­self as “some­what shy”, a 13-year-old girl stepped out of her com­fort zone to en­gage her school and write emails to strangers, even­tu­ally col­lect­ing more than $164,000 for the vic­tim of an e-scooter ac­ci­dent.</p>
    <p>Grade 7 stu­dent Sophia Chiam from St Joseph’s In­sti­tu­tion (In­ter­na­tional) started the crowd­fund­ing in Au­gust with the help of her mother, Dr Lisa Chen, after read­ing about Madam Ang Liu Kiow’s plight in The Straits Times. In less than two months, the fund for the 57-yearold ac­ci­dent vic­tim re­ceived do­na­tions from 1,459 con­trib­u­tors.</p>
    <p>Sophia told ST she was sur­prised that the cam­paign gained such trac­tion. “(Fund rais­ing) takes hu­mil­ity and some­times a thick-skinned, brazen (and) for­ward ap­proach, but when I re­minded my­self of the cause, I was able to de­spite be­ing some­what shy,” she said. “It helped when to­tal strangers stepped up and shared their thoughts and words of en­cour­age­ment.”</p>
    <p>ST re­ported on July 26 that Madam Ang had brain dam­age af</p>
    <p>ter be­ing hit by an e-scooter in 2016, and needs help to carry out ac­tiv­i­ties of daily liv­ing.</p>
    <p>In July, the court or­dered es­cooter rider Ni­cholas Ting Nai Jie, 21, to pay $445,000 to Madam Ang after her hus­band, Mr Leong Loon Wah, sued him on her be­half. How­ever, Mr Ting said through his lawyer that he would not be able to pay the sum, as he has no as­sets and was not cov­ered by in­sur­ance.</p>
    <p>Sophia’s fam­ily raised funds through SJI (In­ter­na­tional), Sophia’s pri­mary school, so­cial me­dia and by word of mouth. They also pub­li­cised the cam­paign at clin­ics un­der the Min­med Group and at var­i­ous eater­ies owned by Dr Chen and her hus­band Eric Chiam.</p>
    <p>In the 2016 ac­ci­dent, Madam Ang was hit by the elec­tric scooter on a foot­path in Pasir Ris. She hit her head on the ground when she fell, and had emer­gency surgery for bleed­ing in her brain.</p>
    <p>She is now un­able to speak, read or write and needs help with eat­ing, dress­ing and us­ing the bath­room. Doc­tors do not ex­pect her to re­cover fur­ther from her dis­abil­i­ties.</p>
    <p>Her hus­band, also 57, is a con­tract worker mak­ing $2,000 to $3,000 a month, and the fam­ily has had to hire a helper.</p>
    <p>Ear­lier this month, Sophia vis­ited Madam Ang and her fam­ily after the crowd­fund­ing closed on Sept 30.</p>
    <p>Speak­ing to ST through his pro bono lawyer, Mr Bene­dict Teo of Drew & Napier, Mr Leong said the money raised will help cover re­cur­ring ex­penses for Madam Ang’s treat­ment. “I never ex­pected such a large do­na­tion sum from the pub­lic. (I’m) very sur­prised that such a young girl man­aged to do so much (and also) by the num­ber of Sin­ga­pore­ans who came for­ward to help,” said Mr Leong.</p>
