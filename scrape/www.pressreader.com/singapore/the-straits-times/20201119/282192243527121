    <p>LON­DON Paris and Zurich have joined Hong Kong as this year’s costli­est cities world­wide, while Sin­ga­pore and Osaka slipped from their joint top spot after the coro­n­avirus pan­demic weak­ened the US dol­lar, a sur­vey pub­lished yes­ter­day showed.</p>
    <p>The big­gest mover was Te­heran, which jumped 27 places on US sanc­tions, the Econ­o­mist In­tel­li­gence Unit (EIU) added in its World­wide Cost of Liv­ing 2020 re­port.</p>
    <p>The pan­demic’s ef­fect on the dol­lar was, how­ever, the big­gest fac­tor for places switch­ing, the fi­nan­cial re­search group noted.</p>
    <p>“The Covid-19 pan­demic has caused the US dol­lar to weaken while Western Euro­pean and</p>
    <p>North Asian cur­ren­cies have strength­ened against it, which in turn has shifted prices for goods and ser­vices,” said Ms Upasana Dutt, head of world­wide cost of liv­ing at the EIU.</p>
    <p>The EIU said “Sin­ga­pore and Osaka, which have been dis­lodged from their joint first with Hong Kong, find them­selves at fourth and fifth ranks, re­spec­tively, with Osaka ty­ing with Tel Aviv.</p>
    <p>“The move­ment of Paris and Zurich to join Hong Kong at the top spot was spurred by the rise of the euro and Swiss franc against the US dol­lar, as well as the com­par­a­tive de­cline in the cost of liv­ing in the two Asian cities that pre­vi­ously sat at the top of the ta­ble”.</p>
    <p>The re­port noted that prices in Sin­ga­pore fell on an ex­o­dus of for­eign work­ers.</p>
    <p>“With the city state’s over­all pop­u­la­tion con­tract­ing for the first time since 2003, de­mand has de­clined, and de­fla­tion has set in.</p>
    <p>“Osaka has seen sim­i­lar trends, with con­sumer prices stag­nat­ing and the Ja­panese gov­ern­ment sub­si­dis­ing costs such as public trans­port.”</p>
    <p>New York, the city the in­dex is bench­marked against, and Los An­ge­les both fell in the rank­ings.</p>
    <p>The Big Ap­ple fell one spot to joint sev­enth with Geneva, and Los An­ge­les dropped to ninth – equal with Copen­hagen.</p>
    <p>“The coro­n­avirus pan­demic has im­pacted spend­ing habits all over the world, with the prices of es­sen­tial goods prov­ing more re­silient than those deemed non-es­sen­tial,” the re­port said.</p>
    <p>“How­ever, this trans­lates to prices for sta­ples, such as cof­fee, cheese, rice and orange juice, re­main­ing flat rather than nec­es­sar­ily in­creas­ing.</p>
    <p>“Cloth­ing was the only cat­e­gory to see an av­er­age fall in the in­dex... (as) many con­sumers de­layed wardrobe changes.”</p>
    <p>With of­fice work­ers do­ing their jobs from home, con­sumer elec­tron­ics saw the largest price rises on pro­duc­tion short­ages, the EIU added.</p>
