    <p>•</p>
    <p>SYD­NEY In a shock U-turn, Ar­gentina’s rugby union yes­ter­day lifted the interim sus­pen­sions of skip­per Pablo Mat­era and two other players for racist tweets, just two days af­ter call­ing the posts “un­ac­cept­able”.</p>
    <p>Coach Mario Ledesma hailed the flanker as a “great hu­man be­ing” de­spite the tweets, which date back sev­eral years and were de­scribed as “dis­crim­i­na­tory” and “xeno­pho­bic” by the rugby union.</p>
    <p>The volte-face fol­lowed re­ports that Ar­gentina’s players had threat­ened to strike over the sus­pen­sions of Mat­era, sec­ond row Guido Petti and re­place­ment hooker San­ti­ago So­cino.</p>
    <p>All three players have been left out of the team to play Aus­tralia in the fi­nal Tri Na­tions game in Syd­ney to­mor­row but Ledesma made it clear they would be back.</p>
    <p>“They reached an agree­ment with the union about not play­ing this game but what I can say is they are three fine players and great men, they are great hu­man be­ings,” he said on a Zoom call.</p>
    <p>“They’ve been suf­fer­ing a lot this week, their fam­i­lies have suf­fered a lot this week. It’s re­ally sad to see.”</p>
    <p>Asked if Mat­era would re­gain the arm­band, he con­firmed: “Ex­actly right. Pablo won’t be play­ing this game but he is still the cap­tain.”</p>
    <p>Cen­tre Jeron­imo de la Fuente will be the interim skip­per to­mor­row, with sweep­ing changes to the Pu­mas team af­ter their 38-0 thrash­ing by New Zealand last week.</p>
    <p>Mat­era, 27, had ear­lier said he was “deeply ashamed” of the tweets, posted be­tween 2011 and 2013 and since deleted, in­clud­ing one where he spoke of run­ning over blacks with his car.</p>
    <p>Petti re­ferred to his do­mes­tic worker as a “pri­mate” and ac­cused blacks of steal­ing mobile phones and wal­lets.</p>
    <p>The posts resur­faced af­ter crit­i­cism that the Pu­mas did not ad­e­quately pay trib­ute to Ar­gentina foot­ball icon Diego Maradona, who died last week, be­fore Satur­day’s de­feat by the All Blacks.</p>
    <p>Ledesma added there had been “a lot of hate go­ing on” dur­ing the week and his players were “re­ally, re­ally af­fected”.</p>
    <p>“They are not the same peo­ple that they were at 17 or 18 years old. They are great men, fam­ily men,” he said of the trio.</p>
    <p>In an­nounc­ing the sus­pen­sions on Tues­day, the Ar­gentina Rugby Union said it “con­demns any in­stance of hate speech and con­sid­ers it un­ac­cept­able that any­one ex­press­ing those views would rep­re­sent our coun­try”.</p>
    <p>But it said yes­ter­day that while the dis­ci­plinary process was con­tin­u­ing, “up­hold­ing interim mea­sures is un­nec­es­sary”, and de­cided to in­stead lift the sus­pen­sion of the three players and re­in­state the cap­taincy of Mat­era.</p>
    <p>The tur­bu­lent week caps a roller-coaster year for Ar­gentina, whose coro­n­avirus-hit build-up to the Tri Na­tions failed to de­rail prepa­ra­tions as they up­set New Zealand for the first time and drew with hosts Aus­tralia be­fore the All Blacks got their revenge.</p>
    <p>While Aus­tralia and Ar­gentina are still math­e­mat­i­cally in with a shout, New Zealand are set to be of­fi­cially crowned Tri Na­tions cham­pi­ons this week­end.</p>
    <p>Both the Wal­la­bies and the Pu­mas need a bonus-point win and in Aus­tralia’s case, they must beat the Pu­mas by a mas­sive 101 points.</p>
    <p>For Ar­gentina to clinch their big­gest tro­phy, they need to thrash the hosts by 93 points.</p>
    <p>FROM BOYS TO MEN</p>
    <p>They are not the same peo­ple that they were at 17 or 18 years old. They are great men, fam­ily men.</p>
    <p>MARIO LEDESMA, Ar­gentina coach, on how racist tweets by Pablo Mat­era, Guido Petti and San­ti­ago So­cino posted be­tween 2011 and 2013 do not de­fine them in the present.</p>
