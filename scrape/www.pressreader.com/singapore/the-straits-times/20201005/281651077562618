    <p>• For­mer Malaysian premier Ma­hathir Mo­hamad could yet lead his two-month-old party, as well as the op­po­si­tion, into the next gen­eral elec­tion, as he re­vealed that sup­port­ers still want him to con­tinue as an elected rep­re­sen­ta­tive.</p>
    <p>The 95-year-old had said at the end of last month that he would not con­test the next na­tional vote but in­stead cam­paign for his new party, Parti Pe­juang Tanah Air, in a fight against cor­rup­tion.</p>
    <p>But a few days later, Tun Dr Ma­hathir said his plan to re­frain from stand­ing for elec­tion was due to the fact that he would be 98, should Malaysia’s 15th gen­eral elec­tion be held when the cur­rent par­lia­men­tary term ends in 2023.</p>
    <p>This opens up the pos­si­bil­ity that Dr Ma­hathir, who has twice been prime min­is­ter, could be a can­di­date for an 11th time in fresh polls that most ob­servers ex­pect to be called within months.</p>
    <p>In an in­ter­view with The Straits Times last Fri­day, he ex­plained that his pro­posal not to stand “has caused a lot of un­hap­pi­ness among my sup­port­ers”.</p>
    <p>“They still want me to say that I want to con­test. It is true that most peo­ple at 95 would not be func­tional. I am more for­tu­nate, I am still able to be ac­tive. But they don’t seem to think I will de­te­ri­o­rate when I grow older,” he said. “They see me as I am now. So they want me, at least, not to say that I won’t con­test.”</p>
    <p>This comes amid a ques­tion mark over the longevity of the Muhyid­din Yassin ad­min­is­tra­tion, af­ter op­po­si­tion l eader An­war Ibrahim claimed he had won the sup­port of the ma­jor­ity of MPs. But the Pakatan Hara­pan leader has yet to prove this claim or gain an au­di­ence with the King.</p>
    <p>The grow­ing un­cer­tainty could lead to Par­lia­ment be­ing dis­solved, though most politi­cians be­lieve na­tion­wide polls could be dis­as­trous in the short term as the num­ber of coro­n­avirus in­fec­tions in Malaysia has hit record highs in re­cent days.</p>
