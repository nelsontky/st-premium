    <p>•</p>
    <p>A bi­par­ti­san House panel in the United States has said that ar­ti­fi­cial in­tel­li­gence (AI), quan­tum com­put­ing, space and biotech­nol­ogy were “mak­ing tra­di­tional bat­tle­fields and bound­aries in­creas­ingly ir­rel­e­vant” – but that the Pen­tagon was cling­ing to age­ing weapons sys­tems meant for a past era.</p>
    <p>The panel’s re­port, called the Fu­ture Of De­fence Task Force, is one of many un­der way in Congress to grap­ple with the speed at which the Pen­tagon is adopt­ing new tech­nolo­gies, of­ten us­ing the ris­ing com­pe­ti­tion with China in an ef­fort to spur the pace of change.</p>
    <p>Most reach a sim­i­lar con­clu­sion: For all the talk of em­brac­ing new tech­nolo­gies, the pol­i­tics of killing off old weapons sys­tems is so for­bid­ding – of­ten be­cause it in­volves clos­ing fac­to­ries or bases and en­dan­gers mil­i­tary jobs in con­gres­sional districts – that the ef­forts fal­ter.</p>
    <p>The task force said it was con­cen­trat­ing on the next 30 to 50 years, and con­cluded that the De­fence Depart­ment and Congress should be “focused on the needs of the fu­ture and not on the po­lit­i­cal and mil­i­tary-in­dus­trial loy­al­ties of the past”.</p>
    <p>“We are to­tally out of time, and here is a bi­par­ti­san group – in this en­vi­ron­ment – say­ing that this is a race we have to win and that we are cur­rently los­ing,” said Rep­re­sen­ta­tive Seth Moul­ton, a Mas­sachusetts Demo­crat who served with the Ma­rine Corps in Iraq and was a cochair­man of the task force.</p>
    <p>“There is a mis­align­ment of pri­or­i­ties, and di­min­ish­ing time to make dra­matic changes.”</p>
    <p>The re­port calls for the US to un­der­take an AI ef­fort that uses “the Man­hat­tan Project as a model”, cit­ing the drive in World War II to as­sem­ble the na­tion’s best minds in nu­clear physics and weapons to de­velop the atomic bomb.</p>
    <p>The task force found that al­though the Pen­tagon had been ex­per­i­ment­ing with AI, ma­chine learn­ing and even semi-au­ton­o­mous weapons sys­tems for years, “cul­tural re­sis­tance to its wider adop­tion re­mains”.</p>
    <p>It rec­om­mended that ev­ery ma­jor mil­i­tary ac­qui­si­tion pro­gramme “eval­u­ate at least one AI or au­ton­o­mous alternativ­e” be­fore it is funded.</p>
    <p>It also called for the US to “lead in the for­mu­la­tion and rat­i­fi­ca­tion of a global treaty on ar­ti­fi­cial in­tel­li­gence in the vein of the Geneva Con­ven­tions”, a step the Trump ad­min</p>
    <p>is­tra­tion has re­sisted for cy­ber weaponry and the broader use of AI.</p>
    <p>But ques­tions per­sist about whether such a treaty would prove use­ful. While nu­clear and chem­i­cal weapons were largely in the hands</p>
    <p>of na­tions, cy­ber weapons – and AI tech­niques – are in the hands of crim­i­nal groups, ter­ror­ist groups and teenagers.</p>
    <p>Still, the re­port’s fo­cus on work­ing with al­lies and de­vel­op­ing global codes of ethics and privacy</p>
    <p>runs counter to the in­stincts of the Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion, mak­ing it more sur­pris­ing that the Repub­li­can mem­bers of the task force signed on.</p>
    <p>“I think this is a case of push­ing for a dif­fer­ent path at the Penta</p>
    <p>gon,” said Rep­re­sen­ta­tive Jim Banks, an In­di­ana Repub­li­can and a co-chair­man of the group.</p>
    <p>This week, House Repub­li­cans plan to is­sue an­other re­port, aimed at con­tain­ing Chi­nese power.</p>
