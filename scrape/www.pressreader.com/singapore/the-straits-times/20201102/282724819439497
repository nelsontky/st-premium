    <p>Pan­demic lock­downs in coun­tries such as Den­mark and Ire­land re­port­edly led to fewer preterm births ear­lier this year. Ex­perts there spec­u­late that re­duced stress could be a cause.</p>
    <p>How­ever, KK Women’s And Chil­dren’s Hos­pi­tal (KKH) and the Na­tional Univer­sity Hos­pi­tal (NUH) do not see a sim­i­lar trend here for pre­ma­ture ba­bies, who are those born be­fore 37 weeks.</p>
    <p>The pro­por­tion of pre­emies here has held steady over the last five years at be­tween one in 12 ba­bies and one in 11 ba­bies, ac­cord­ing to a Min­istry of Health spokesman.</p>
    <p>World­wide, the fig­ure is one in 10 ba­bies. Dr Quek Bin Huey, head and se­nior con­sul­tant in the neona­tal in­ten­sive care unit of the KKH’s Depart­ment of Neona­tol­ogy, says that while cir­cuit breaker mea­sures may have re­sulted in less com­mut­ing and less stress, there were re­ports of ex­pec­tant moth­ers fac­ing in­creased stress be­cause of the chal­lenges of work­ing from home and the loss or drop in fi­nan­cial sup­port be­cause of the eco­nomic im­pact of Covid-19.</p>
    <p>Dr Khoo Poh Choo, deputy head and se­nior con­sul­tant at KKH’s Depart­ment of</p>
    <p>Neona­tol­ogy, says pre­ma­ture birth is the lead­ing cause of death in chil­dren un­der the age of five world­wide.</p>
    <p>“Ba­bies born too early may have more health is­sues than ba­bies born full term, and are more sus­cep­ti­ble to long-term health prob­lems af­fect­ing the brain, lungs, hear­ing or vi­sion,” she says.</p>
    <p>Among pre­emies, there are huge dif­fer­ences be­tween those born at 35 weeks and 24 weeks, says As­so­ciate Pro­fes­sor Zubair Amin, head and se­nior con­sul­tant at the Depart­ment of Neona­tol­ogy in the Khoo Teck Puat – Na­tional Univer­sity Chil­dren’s Med­i­cal In­sti­tute at NUH.</p>
    <p>Mod­er­ate to late preterm ba­bies may need a few days’ stay in a nurs­ery be­fore go­ing home. But preterm in­fants born be­fore 28 weeks are ex­pected to stay four to six months in a neona­tal in­ten­sive care unit or spe­cial care nurs­ery.</p>
    <p>He says many pre­emies “are able to make very sig­nif­i­cant strides towards catch­ing up” and adds that fam­ily sup­port plays a cru­cial role help­ing them thrive.</p>
    <p>“A sup­port­ive fam­ily can make a sig­nif­i­cant im­prove­ment in a pre­ma­ture baby’s devel­op­ment.”</p>
