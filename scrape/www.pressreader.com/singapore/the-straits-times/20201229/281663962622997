    <p>Pres­i­dent Ro­drigo Duterte’s se­nior min­is­ters and body­guards have al­ready re­ceived a Covid-19 vac­cine that lo­cal reg­u­la­tors have yet to ap­prove.</p>
    <p>“I know some from the Cabi­net and from the PSG (Pres­i­den­tial Se­cu­rity Group) who have al­ready been in­oc­u­lated,” In­te­rior Min­is­ter Ed­uardo Ano, who is among the over­seers of a coro­n­avirus task force, said in a ra­dio in­ter­view yes­ter­day. But Mr Duterte him­self has yet to get a shot, he said.</p>
    <p>Soon after word got out of this early mass vac­ci­na­tion, the Health Min­istry is­sued a warning against the use of unau­tho­rised vac­cines.</p>
    <p>The mixed mes­sag­ing is throw­ing the Philip­pines’ vac­ci­na­tion pro­gramme into dis­ar­ray.</p>
    <p>Mr Ano de­clined to iden­tify the vac­cine used, but said it had al­ready re­ceived emer­gency use au­tho­ri­sa­tion abroad.</p>
    <p>In his morn­ing news con­fer­ence, Mr Duterte’s spokesman Harry Roque said sol­diers were among those given the vac­cine man­u­fac­tured by China’s Sinopharm.</p>
    <p>De­fence Sec­re­tary Delfin Loren­zana later dis­closed that these were men and women as­signed as Mr Duterte’s body­guards.</p>
    <p>Sinopharm’s vac­cine has yet to be cleared by reg­u­la­tors, and the man­u­fac­turer has not even ap­plied for the vac­cine’s emer­gency use au­tho­ri­sa­tion in the Philip­pines.</p>
    <p>But Mr Roque said the vac­cine “is safe”. He said it has al­ready been au­tho­rised for emer­gency use in the United Arab Emi­rates, which has rated it as 86 per cent ef­fec­tive, and is al­ready be­ing widely used in China. He also sug­gested vac­cines that have al­ready been al­lowed for emer­gency use in other coun­tries, in­clud­ing those of Pfizer and Moderna, should be safe to use here.</p>
    <p>Clear­ance from the Philip­pines’ Food and Drug Ad­min­is­tra­tion (FDA) is needed only to sanc­tion com­mer­cial dis­tri­bu­tion and sale of vac­cines, Mr Roque said.</p>
    <p>No one can sell or dis­trib­ute vac­cines with­out the FDA’s ap­proval, he said. But those who can se­cure doses on their own can have them­selves in­oc­u­lated, with­out be­ing pros­e­cuted. “The law does not bar any­one from get­ting shots of un­reg­is­tered vac­cines,” Mr Roque said.</p>
    <p>In a state­ment later in the day, the PSG it­self sought to jus­tify why its men were in­oc­u­lated with an un­ap­proved vac­cine.</p>
    <p>“As the unit pri­mar­ily tasked to pro­tect and se­cure the high­est of­fi­cial of the land, the PSG will have to en­sure that the Pres­i­dent is safe from all threats, in­clud­ing Covid-19. It is the PSG’s pri­mor­dial task to en­sure that we have a healthy pres­i­dent serv­ing our fel­low Filipinos ev­ery day,” PSG com­man­der Je­sus Du­rante said.</p>
    <p>The PSG has about 4,000 men, but not all are as­signed as Mr Duterte’s body­guards. Some are as­signed to Vice-Pres­i­dent Leni Ro­bredo, or tasked to pro­tect key gov­ern­ment in­stal­la­tions.</p>
    <p>But the FDA is­sued its own state­ment strongly ad­vis­ing against the use of an un­sanc­tioned vac­cine.</p>
    <p>“With­out the proper au­tho­ri­sa­tion, there is no guar­an­tee on the safety, qual­ity and ef­fi­cacy of said vac­cine, as the same has not un­der­gone the re­quired tech­ni­cal eval­u­a­tion by the FDA,” said the agency’s head, Dr Eric Domingo.</p>
    <p>The Health Min­istry said in its own state­ment that “the use of un­reg­is­tered prod­ucts poses harm to a per­son’s health and safety. This is why only vac­cines which have been ap­proved and found to be safe should be ad­min­is­tered”.</p>
