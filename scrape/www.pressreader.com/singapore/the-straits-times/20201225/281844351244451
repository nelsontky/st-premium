    <p>The Aus­tralian gov­ern­ment has im­posed a ban on ex­ports of re­cy­clable waste as it tries to boost re­cy­cling in the wake of a Chi­nese im­port ban that left Aus­tralia with mount­ing piles of rub­bish.</p>
    <p>The new leg­is­la­tion bans ex­ports of un­pro­cessed plas­tic, pa­per, glass and tyres, and has been ac­com­pa­nied by a push by fed­eral and state gov­ern­ments to de­velop do­mes­tic re­cy­cling fa­cil­i­ties and to en­cour­age busi­nesses to use re­cy­cled prod­ucts.</p>
    <p>Fed­eral En­vi­ron­ment Min­is­ter Sus­san Ley said the ban would help to pro­tect the en­vi­ron­ment and pro­mote jobs: “The ex­port ban sends a strong mes­sage that it is time to take re­spon­si­bil­ity for our waste, to seize the eco­nomic op­por­tu­ni­ties of trans­form­ing our re­cy­cling in­dus­try and to stop send­ing prob­lem waste over­seas.</p>
    <p>“By do­ing this we can play an im­por­tant role in re­duc­ing the mil­lions of tonnes of plas­tic that pol­lute the world’s oceans.”</p>
    <p>The leg­is­la­tion fol­lows a sud­den ban im­posed by China in 2018 on im­ports of 24 types of waste – a move that caused stock­pil­ing in Aus­tralia and led to re­cy­clable waste be­ing sent to land­fills. China pre­vi­ously bought about 30 per cent of Aus­tralia’s waste ex­ports but banned im­ports over con­cerns that some ma­te­ri­als en­ter­ing from over­seas were overly con­tam­i­nated and posed a risk to the en­vi­ron­ment and pub­lic health.</p>
    <p>China’s ban prompted a re­think in Aus­tralia about how to deal with its waste.</p>
    <p>Aus­tralia pro­duces high amounts of waste – al­most three mil­lion tonnes per per­son a year – and has rel­a­tively low re­cy­cling rates. About 60 per cent of waste was re­cy­cled last year, ac­cord­ing to of­fi­cial data.</p>
    <p>Last year, Aus­tralia ex­ported al­most 4.5 mil­lion tonnes of waste over­seas, mainly to In­done­sia, In­dia, Viet­nam, China, Bangladesh and Malaysia.</p>
    <p>The new law bans glass ex­ports from Jan 1, fol­lowed by bans on ex­ports of plas­tics and tyres by 2022 and card­board in 2024.</p>
    <p>The gov­ern­ment is also seek­ing to boost re­cy­cling ca­pac­ity. It is in­vest­ing A$190 mil­lion (S$192 mil­lion) in a A$600 mil­lion scheme, also sup­ported by states and the pri­vate sec­tor, to de­velop new fa­cil­i­ties for sort­ing, pro­cess­ing and re­man­u­fac­tur­ing waste. The ini­tia­tive is ex­pected to cre­ate 10,000 jobs.</p>
    <p>The Na­tional Waste and Re­cy­cling In­dus­try Coun­cil, which rep­re­sents waste man­age­ment busi­nesses, wel­comed the move to help boost do­mes­tic waste re­cy­cling and re­cov­ery rates. But it said the gov­ern­ment should also con­sider in­cen­tives to en­cour­age use of re­cy­cled prod­ucts, such as im­pos­ing a tax on new plas­tic waste or re­bates for firms re­cy­cling used plas­tics.</p>
    <p>“We see the leg­is­la­tion as an op­por­tu­nity to de­velop the re­source re­cov­ery sec­tor and re­cov­ery rates in Aus­tralia and to cre­ate more busi­ness op­por­tu­ni­ties,” coun­cil chief ex­ec­u­tive Rose Read told The Straits Times.</p>
    <p>“But there has to also be a fi­nan­cial in­cen­tive to grow de­mand for re­cy­cled plas­tics.”</p>
    <p>En­vi­ron­men­tal groups largely wel­comed the leg­is­la­tion but urged Can­berra and the states to do more to dis­cour­age the un­nec­es­sary use of ma­te­ri­als, par­tic­u­larly plas­tic bags and cut­lery.</p>
    <p>The Aus­tralian Marine Con­ser­va­tion So­ci­ety said the law “will not re­duce the plas­tic flow­ing into our oceans”.</p>
    <p>“To re­ally deal with the plas­tic pol­lu­tion cri­sis in Aus­tralia we must make tar­gets to cut plas­tic pack­ag­ing manda­tory,” said so­ci­ety spokesman Shane Cu­cow. “We need a na­tion­wide frame­work for elim­i­nat­ing the most lethal plas­tics for ocean wildlife, like plas­tic bags, straws and cut­lery.”</p>
