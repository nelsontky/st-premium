    <p>NEW YORK • Now that stay-ath­ome re­stric­tions are eas­ing, those of us in­ter­ested in build­ing strong, healthy mus­cles but wea­ried by burpees in the liv­ing room may want to con­sider head­ing to the near­est park or play­ground for weight train­ing.</p>
    <p>Ex­perts note that you can per­form most stan­dard ex­er­cises there if you are will­ing to use your imag­i­na­tion – you can even re­cruit your chil­dren to help as gig­gling, re­sis­tance-adding work­out part­ners.</p>
    <p>What fol­lows are a few moves for a full-body, sun-drenched rou­tine. Wear a face mask, ob­serve so­cial dis­tanc­ing and use gloves or hand sani­tiser to pro­tect your­self and oth­ers, of course.</p>
    <p>FIND A TREE TRUNK</p>
    <p>In the park, look for a tree nar­row enough to en­cir­cle with your arms. Hug it. Then squat, bot­tom out, knees bent to al­most 90 de­grees.</p>
    <p>Hold a few sec­onds and re­peat the full squat or pulse shorter ones, mov­ing up and down rapidly a few cen­time­tres at a time.</p>
    <p>As Dan­nah Bol­lig, a per­sonal trainer in Chicago and a for­mer Di­vi­sion I foot­ball player, ex­plained: “You just took your barre class out­side and worked mus­cles in your thighs and back­side. You can per­form the same ex­er­cise us­ing a bas­ket­ball hoop or light pole.”</p>
    <p>USE A PARK BENCH</p>
    <p>In­stead of loung­ing on it, a park bench (in good re­pair) can be used for “step-ups, box jumps and han­del­e­vated push-ups”, said Adam Rosante, a New York-based per­sonal trainer.</p>
    <p>In non-gym j ar­gon: Face the bench and rapidly step on to and off it, first with one foot and then the other. The fit and well-co­or­di­nated might try it with both feet to­gether, hop­ping.</p>
    <p>For up­per-body strength­en­ing, face the bench so that when you lean against it, your arms and back are straight.</p>
    <p>Lower your­self to­wards the bench by bend­ing your el­bows un­til your chest al­most touches the bench. Push back up. Re­peat un­til your up­per arms start to wob­ble like noo­dles.</p>
    <p>Park benches and l ow play­ground equip­ment also work well for dips, which strengthen the up­per-arm mus­cles, said Jeremy Loen­neke, an as­sis­tant pro­fes­sor of health, ex­er­cise and recre­ation science at the Univer­sity of Mis­sis­sippi in Ox­ford.</p>
    <p>Po­si­tion your­self at one end, back to the bench, with your arms hold­ing the edge of the bench be­hind you. Then lower your­self un­til your el­bows are bent to about 90 de­grees.</p>
    <p>“The move­ment can be made eas­ier by bring­ing the feet closer,” Loen­neke said, “or more dif­fi­cult by walk­ing the feet out far­ther.”</p>
    <p>HEAD TO THE MON­KEY BARS</p>
    <p>One of the best re­sis­tance ex­er­cises, pull-ups work your en­tire up­per body and mid-sec­tion.</p>
    <p>You could use tree branches, but their health and car­ry­ing power can be sus­pect, so bet­ter to head for the mon­key bars at the play­ground.</p>
    <p>Grab the bar about shoul­der­width apart, palms fac­ing out, and pull your­self up.</p>
    <p>“Here’s a good play­time op­por­tu­nity for tod­dlers who are game: For greater re­sis­tance, swing your lit­tle one onto your shoul­ders be­fore start­ing, cre­at­ing a pig­gy­back pullup,” said Si­mon Walker, a pro­fes­sor of ex­er­cise science at Fin­land’s Univer­sity of Jy­vaskyla. “Af­ter­wards, per­haps, drop down gen­tly and try some pig­gy­back push-ups.”</p>
    <p>If you can­not com­plete a pull-up – and many of us can­not – try lift­ing both of your legs while you hang from the bars, Bol­lig said, ei­ther with or with­out your knees bent, which works the up­per body and mid­sec­tion.</p>
    <p>TIRE YOUR­SELF OUT WITH A TYRE SWING</p>
    <p>Fi­nally, re­mem­ber that to our mus­cles, weight is weight, Walker said, whether it comes in the form of a bar­bell or a boul­der – our bi­ceps, glutes, quads and other mus­cles will strengthen and grow sim­i­larly in re­sponse to lift­ing ei­ther.</p>
    <p>So look for nat­u­ral weights in the park or play­ground, in­clud­ing branches, logs and stones.</p>
    <p>“Heft them the way you would dumb­bells or ket­tle­bells,” Rosante said. “Use them to add weight on a va­ri­ety of squats, lunges, hip thrusts and over­head presses.”</p>
    <p>If you hold a rock in each hand dur­ing these moves, make sure that they are of about the same weight, for bal­ance.</p>
    <p>Tyre swings, too, can dou­ble as dumb­bells, Rosante pointed out.</p>
    <p>Hold the tyre by your side with one hand and shrug your shoul­der up, for a “sin­gle-arm shrug”; or stand side­ways to it, grasp, twist and raise it for “low to high wood­chop­pers”; or pass it to a part­ner like a medicine ball.</p>
    <p>And should all of these ex­er­cises start to be­come easy and fa­mil­iar, “set a timer for 10 min­utes and see how many times you can make it through the en­tire play­ground”, Rosante sug­gested.</p>
    <p>A work­out that should chal­lenge the fittest and be, he said, “se­ri­ously fun”.</p>
