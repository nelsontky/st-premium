    <p>Fi­nan­cial in­sti­tu­tions aim to create 1,800 new jobs and 2,000 trainee­ships by June next year, a sur­vey noted yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Around 880 of these posts will be in tech­nol­ogy, in­clud­ing top roles such as ap­pli­ca­tion de­vel­op­ers, ap­pli­ca­tion ar­chi­tects and busi­ness an­a­lysts.</p>
    <p>The sur­vey, which polled about 30 firms ac­count­ing for 40 per cent of the fi­nan­cial ser­vices work­force on their pro­jected hir­ing over the 12 months from July this year, also found that com­pa­nies are re­cruit­ing for ba­sic po­si­tions such as tech sup­port.</p>
    <p>“These roles are typ­i­cally less com­plex and more rules-based,” said Mr Ravi Menon, man­ag­ing di­rec­tor of the Mon­e­tary Author­ity of Sin­ga­pore (MAS), which con­ducted the sur­vey.</p>
    <p>“How­ever, they pay less than in­ter­me­di­ate and ad­vanced tech roles and have not ap­pealed to Sin­ga­pore­ans as much.</p>
    <p>“We hope more lo­cals will take up these job roles, even if they are less paid, which also pro­vide a path­way to the in­ter­me­di­ate tech jobs, which are in de­mand.”</p>
    <p>In­ter­me­di­ate tech jobs in­clude ap­pli­ca­tion de­vel­op­ers, data an­a­lysts and cy­ber se­cu­rity spe­cial­ists.</p>
    <p>“These are roles which Sin­ga­pore­ans with rel­e­vant back­ground can po­ten­tially be trained into,” said Mr Menon, who was speak­ing at a we­bi­nar yes­ter­day or­gan­ised by the MAS and the In­sti­tute of Bank­ing and Fi­nance (IBF).</p>
    <p>He noted that the MAS and IBF started a Tech­nol­ogy in Fi­nance Im­mer­sion Pro­gramme last year to help fi­nan­cial in­sti­tu­tions hire mid-ca­reer lo­cals from other sec­tors with back­grounds in science, tech­nol­ogy, en­gi­neer­ing and math­e­mat­ics.</p>
    <p>The pro­gramme, which is sup­ported by Work­force Sin­ga­pore and the In­fo­comm Me­dia De­vel­op­ment Author­ity, in­volves train­ing and at­tach­ments in ar­eas such as data an­a­lyt­ics, cy­ber se­cu­rity, cloud com­put­ing and full stack de­vel­op­ment.</p>
    <p>Ad­vanced-level tech roles in de­mand in­clude en­ter­prise and in­fra­struc­ture ar­chi­tects, which are spe­cial­ist po­si­tions re­quir­ing highly tech­ni­cal skills, Mr Menon noted.</p>
    <p>“It re­quires years of train­ing and ex­pe­ri­ence to at­tain mas­tery of these skills. The lo­cal sup­ply of ta­lent for such jobs is quite lim­ited, and fi­nan­cial in­sti­tu­tions will need to rely on ex­per­tise from abroad while build­ing a pipe­line of lo­cals for these ad­vanced tech roles,” he added.</p>
    <p>Roles in pri­vate bank­ing and wealth man­age­ment are ex­pected to ac­count for 12 per cent of the jobs be­ing of­fered, noted the sur­vey. These in­clude po­si­tions like re­la­tion­ship man­age­ment and dig­i­tal trans­for­ma­tion.</p>
    <p>The re­main­ing new j obs are spread across other busi­ness seg­ments, in­clud­ing in­sur­ance, cor­po­rate, con­sumer and in­vest­ment bank­ing, and as­set man­age­ment, as well as in cor­po­rate roles such as fi­nance and hu­man re­sources.</p>
    <p>Mr Menon added that tech jobs will ac­count for 23 per cent of the trainee­ships on of­fer, in roles such as ap­pli­ca­tion de­vel­op­ers and busi­ness an­a­lysts.</p>
    <p>Other trainee­ship roles in­clude those in com­pli­ance, risk man­age­ment and process ex­cel­lence.</p>
    <p>But firms will still be look­ing for ex­pe­ri­enced hires or spe­cial­ists to fill more than 60 per cent of jobs, the sur­vey found.</p>
    <p>Mr Menon said: “Em­ploy­ers must be will­ing to take a cal­cu­lated chance to hire and train mid-ca­reer job seek­ers who have good ex­pe­ri­ence but may not have all the req­ui­site skills, but can be trained.</p>
    <p>“Like­wise, job seek­ers must be will­ing to step out of their com­fort zone and take a stab at try­ing new roles and pick­ing up new skills.”</p>
    <p>Mr Menon noted that fi­nan­cial ser­vices firms cre­ated 1,900 jobs in the first half of this year, all go­ing to lo­cals.</p>
    <p>The sec­tor em­ploys 170,000 peo­ple, ac­count­ing for 4.5 per cent of Sin­ga­pore’s to­tal work­force and 13.3 per cent of gross do­mes­tic prod­uct.</p>
    <p>The MAS will un­der­take the sur­vey ev­ery six months.</p>
    <p>These roles are typ­i­cally less com­plex and more rules-based... How­ever, they pay less than in­ter­me­di­ate and ad­vanced tech roles and have not ap­pealed to Sin­ga­pore­ans as much. We hope more lo­cals will take up these job roles, even if they are less paid, which also pro­vide a path­way to the in­ter­me­di­ate tech jobs, which are in de­mand.</p>
