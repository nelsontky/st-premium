    <p>A na­tion’s eco­nomic pros­per­ity is af­fected by poli­cies as well as hu­man val­ues – and the im­pact of these val­ues should be taken more se­ri­ously than they cur­rently are.</p>
    <p>This is the mes­sage of a new book by fi­nance ex­perts Tan Chin Hwee and Thomas Grand­jean.</p>
    <p>Val­ues At The Core: How Hu­man Val­ues Contribute To The Rise Of Na­tions was launched at a pri­vate event in Ma­rina One yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The book notes much of the work done in re­cent decades to ex­plain the dif­fer­ent eco­nomic out­comes in na­tions has fo­cused on fac­tors such as good gov­er­nance, rule of law and demo­cratic in­sti­tu­tions. An­other ap­proach em­pha­sises the role of ge­o­graph­i­cal fac­tors such as lo­ca­tion and cli­mate.</p>
    <p>But the dif­fer­ent sets of val­ues guid­ing peo­ple are of­ten ne­glected by economists. “Why are hu­man val­ues so of­ten dis­re­garded? Be­cause they are com­plex, they are messy, they are hard to mea­sure,” said Mr Grand­jean, 39.</p>
    <p>“They do not lend them­selves well to beau­ti­ful math­e­mat­i­cal equa­tions. But if we re­move val­ues from the equa­tion, in our view, we can never fully un­der­stand how economies work.”</p>
    <p>Mr Grand­jean cited trust – in one an­other and the gov­ern­ment – as a rea­son why cit­i­zens of coun­tries such as Swe­den, Fin­land and Den­mark ac­cept some of the high­est tax rates in the world.</p>
    <p>“High taxes have made those coun­tries much more equal at a time of grow­ing in­equal­i­ties.</p>
    <p>“But when other coun­tries where trust is much lower try to repli­cate that model, the re­sults are usu­ally dis­ap­point­ing,” he said, with a nod to France un­der former pres­i­dent Fran­cois Hol­lande.</p>
    <p>The book iden­ti­fies four val­ues which the au­thors be­lieve have had the great­est im­pact on eco­nomic life: hard work, thrift, trust to­wards oth­ers and risk-tak­ing.</p>
    <p>It also sug­gests that Con­fu­cian and his­tor­i­cally Protes­tant so­ci­eties’ fo­cus on a strong work ethic made them much richer, ex­cept when these na­tions did not adopt a mar­ket econ­omy.</p>
    <p>Mr Grand­jean said some parts of the book could be “quite sen­si­tive” – no­tably the dis­cus­sion of the value of hard work. “We stressed the fact that if a com­mu­nity does not work as hard, we should not la­bel it as lazy... It’s a ques­tion of per­spec­tive and life pri­or­i­ties.”</p>
    <p>Mr Tan, 49, who has three chil­dren aged 10 to 16, said: “I hope to... tell them that val­ues are im­por­tant and to re­in­force what my par­ents taught me.”</p>
    <p>All pro­ceeds from book sales will go to FamChamps, a stu­dent ini­tia­tive that en­cour­ages young peo­ple to pro­mote fam­ily val­ues.</p>
