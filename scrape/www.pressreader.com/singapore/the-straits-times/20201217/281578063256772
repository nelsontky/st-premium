    <p>WHAT HAP­PENED</p>
    <p>Highly se­cure US gov­ern­ment in­for­ma­tion, po­ten­tially in­volv­ing some of the coun­try’s top agen­cies, was tar­geted in a so­phis­ti­cated hack­ing in­ci­dent – one of the big­gest in re­cent years.</p>
    <p>Ma­li­cious code was hid­den in up­dates to a pop­u­lar soft­ware called Orion, made by US com­pany So­larWinds, which mon­i­tors net­works of busi­nesses and gov­ern­ments for out­ages.</p>
    <p>With the code, hack­ers were able to ac­cess an or­gan­i­sa­tion’s net­works to steal data.</p>
    <p>Prom­i­nent cy­ber-se­cu­rity com­pany FireEye, which it­self uses So­larWinds, said ear­lier this month that it had ex­pe­ri­enced a breach due to the soft­ware.</p>
    <p>FireEye sup­plies ser­vices to in­ter­na­tional gov­ern­ment agen­cies as well as banks, telecom­mu­ni­ca­tions providers and elec­tric­ity com­pa­nies.</p>
    <p>More than 18,000 pri­vate and gov­ern­ment users were re­ported to have down­loaded the tainted Orion soft­ware up­date, which could have al­lowed hack­ers to mon­i­tor in­ter­nal e-mails and steal in­for­ma­tion.</p>
    <p>Agen­cies that may have been im­pacted in­clude the Cen­tres for Dis­ease Con­trol and Preven­tion in the United States, as well as the coun­try’s State De­part­ment and Jus­tice De­part­ment.</p>
    <p>It has been re­ported that last year, So­larWinds was alerted to the fact that any­one could ac­cess its up­date server by us­ing the pass­word “so­lar­winds123”, ex­pos­ing a jar­ring vul­ner­a­bil­ity in the firm’s sys­tem.</p>
    <p>WHO IS AF­FECTED</p>
    <p>The scale of the at­tack is likely to be global, given how So­larWinds pro­vides network mon­i­tor­ing and other tech­ni­cal ser­vices to thou­sands of or­gan­i­sa­tions.</p>
    <p>These in­clude most For­tune 500 com­pa­nies and gov­ern­ment agen­cies in North Amer­ica, Europe, Asia and the Mid­dle East.</p>
    <p>Ex­perts have said that due to Orion’s de­sign – to look for prob­lems in a com­puter network – it could give hack­ers a thor­ough view of an or­gan­i­sa­tion and deep ac­cess into its sys­tems.</p>
    <p>So­larWinds said it sent an ad­vi­sory on Sun­day to about 33,000 of its Orion cus­tomers who might be af­fected, though it es­ti­mated a smaller num­ber of cus­tomers – fewer than 18,000 – had ac­tu­ally in­stalled the com­pro­mised prod­uct up­date ear­lier this year.</p>
    <p>WHO IS RE­SPON­SI­BLE AND WHAT’S NEXT</p>
    <p>So­larWinds said an “out­side na­tion state” in­fil­trated its sys­tems with mal­ware, but nei­ther the US gov­ern­ment nor the af­fected com­pa­nies have pub­licly iden­ti­fied the hack­ers.</p>
    <p>A US of­fi­cial, speak­ing on con­di­tion of anonymity be­cause of an on­go­ing investigat­ion, told The Associated Press on Mon­day that Rus­sian hack­ers are sus­pected.</p>
    <p>Rus­sia re­sponded the same day say­ing it had “noth­ing to do with” the hack­ing.</p>
    <p>So­larWinds may face le­gal ac­tion from pri­vate cus­tomers and gov­ern­ment en­ti­ties af­fected by the breach.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore’s Com­puter Emer­gency Re­sponse Team, a unit of the Cy­ber Se­cu­rity Agency of Sin­ga­pore, has rec­om­mended that or­gan­i­sa­tions dis­con­nect or power down So­larWinds’ Orion prod­ucts from their net­works im­me­di­ately.</p>
