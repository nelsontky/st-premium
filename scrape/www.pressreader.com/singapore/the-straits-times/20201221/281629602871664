    <p>They met as as­pir­ing pro­fes­sional gamers years ago, hop­ing for a chance to meet their he­roes.</p>
    <p>And now, Mr Ian Ang and Mr Alaric Choo have done it – by col­lab­o­rat­ing with and pro­duc­ing gam­ing chairs used by top-tier teams.</p>
    <p>In 2015, the pair founded Se­cret­lab, whose prod­ucts are now sold in more than 60 coun­tries.</p>
    <p>Mr Ang, 28, had been dec­o­rat­ing his room and re­alised that his gam­ing set-up – in­clud­ing key­board, mouse and PC – was all there.</p>
    <p>The miss­ing piece? A gam­ing chair that would be com­fort­able, func­tional, look good and have a lo­cal war­ranty.</p>
    <p>Since he could not find one on the mar­ket, Mr Ang de­cided to make it him­self, and roped in Mr Choo, 32.</p>
    <p>From a small of­fice in 2015, the now mul­ti­mil­lion-dol­lar firm has ex­panded to sev­eral units in a light in­dus­trial build­ing in Ben­de­meer with close to 200 staff.</p>
    <p>For their in­no­va­tion and en­trepreneur­ship – and for putting Sin­ga­pore on the map as one of the most highly rated gam­ing chair man­u­fac­tur­ers in the world – the Se­cret­lab founders are nom­i­nees for this year’s The Straits Times Sin­ga­porean of the Year award.</p>
    <p>When the com­pany first started, it was unique in its field. The gam­ing chair in­dus­try was not as es­tab­lished as it is now. Se­cret­lab is also di­rect-to-con­sumer and op­er­ates al­most en­tirely on­line.</p>
    <p>“There were no text­book an­swers or any­body to re­fer to out there,” said Mr Ang, who is the firm’s chief ex­ec­u­tive. “We’ve al­ways had to take a very creative ap­proach to ev­ery­thing that we do.”</p>
    <p>De­spite their suc­cess, the pair rarely stop to think about what they have ac­com­plished or give them­selves a pat on the back.</p>
    <p>“There’s a say­ing at Se­cret­lab that we al­ways treat each day as if it’s day one. We grow or we die, ev­ery­one should al­ways in­no­vate where they can, im­prove things and never be stuck in the process,” said Mr Ang.</p>
    <p>Mr Choo, who is chief strat­egy of­fi­cer, added: “One of our big­gest achieve­ments is that we get to do some­thing we’re truly pas­sion­ate about and do what we en­joy, and work with peo­ple we’re pas­sion­ate about.”</p>
    <p>Pub­lic records show that Mr Ang owns a 70 per cent stake in Se­cret­lab. Mr Choo has 25 per cent.</p>
    <p>Both founders were tightlippe­d when asked about their plans for the fu­ture, but Mr Ang said the com­pany is al­ways look­ing to grow, es­pe­cially since the mar­ket in Sin­ga­pore has be­come more sat­u­rated as Se­cret­lab chairs be­come more main­stream.</p>
    <p>When asked for their ad­vice to bud­ding en­trepreneur­s, Mr Ang said: “En­trepreneur­ship is a lot about grit. It’s not about not aban­don­ing the busi­ness, but when it’s stress­ful you em­brace it and not take the easy way out.”</p>
    <p>Mr Choo added: “It’s not for ev­ery­one. We ac­tu­ally learnt a lot about busi­ness from play­ing games... it helped us be a lot more an­a­lyt­i­cal and hon­est with our­selves.”</p>
