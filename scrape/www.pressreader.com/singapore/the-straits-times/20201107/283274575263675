    <p>Aries (March 21 - April 19)</p>
    <p>You are feel­ing more im­pul­sive than usual and may jump from fun to se­ri­ous over and over. Your peo­ple may not be able to keep up.</p>
    <p>Tau­rus (April 20 - May 20)</p>
    <p>Be more pa­tient with that one odd­ball who does not fit in with your group. A show of tol­er­ance is sure to pay off in the long run.</p>
    <p>Gem­ini (May 21 - June 20)</p>
    <p>Go easy on ev­ery­one. You can be a great com­fort to some­one if you make the ef­fort to of­fer sup­port. Lend a lis­ten­ing ear.</p>
    <p>Can­cer (June 21 - July 22)</p>
    <p>Your rash side is shak­ing up some part of your life, so see if you can build on this new foun­da­tion. You should be able to work out a com­pro­mise.</p>
    <p>Leo (July 23 - Aug 22)</p>
    <p>Push your ca­reer for­ward or make progress in some other area of your life, in­clud­ing ro­mance. You have the en­ergy for it.</p>
    <p>Virgo (Aug 23 - Sept 22)</p>
    <p>Try to re­lax and breathe deeply when you con­front the big is­sue. Flex­i­bil­ity is the key to suc­cess. You can make the rules later.</p>
    <p>Li­bra (Sept 23 - Oct 22)</p>
    <p>You are in charge of some­thing big and bold, so make sure you are get­ting some­thing out of ev­ery­one in­volved.</p>
    <p>Scor­pio (Oct 23 - Nov 21)</p>
    <p>A dis­play of power late in the day takes you by sur­prise and may de­rail your plans. Bide your time and check out this new player. You will find a weak­ness.</p>
    <p>Sagit­tar­ius (Nov 22 - Dec 21)</p>
    <p>You feel ter­rific and lit­tle prob­lems get re­solved quickly. You should also ex­cel at what­ever you do, which sets the bar higher for the fu­ture.</p>
    <p>Capri­corn (Dec 22 - Jan 19)</p>
    <p>You could be hav­ing some prob­lems re­lated to work or the search for work. See if you can get your friends or col­leagues to help you.</p>
    <p>Aquar­ius (Jan 20 - Feb 18)</p>
    <p>Find a mid­dle ground be­tween work and re­lax­ation or which­ever two as­pects of your life feel most op­posed.</p>
    <p>Pisces (Feb 19 - March 20)</p>
    <p>You have to deal with a blurred bound­ary be­tween fan­tasy and re­al­ity, but that is some­thing you are good at. Get a friend to back you up.</p>
