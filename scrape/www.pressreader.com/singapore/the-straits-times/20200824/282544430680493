    <p>LON­DON • Amer­i­can pop star Tay­lor Swift (right) has do­nated more than £23,000 (S$41,000) to a Lon­don stu­dent raising funds to go to univer­sity.</p>
    <p>Ms Vi­to­ria Mario, 18, won a place to study math­e­mat­ics at Bri­tain’s Univer­sity of War­wick, but could not af­ford to sup­port her­self.</p>
    <p>She asked hun­dreds of com­pa­nies for help and even posted notes through the mail­boxes of homes in af­flu­ent ar­eas. In des­per­a­tion, she turned to on­line crowd­fund­ing – and Swift got in touch.</p>
    <p>“Vi­to­ria, I came across your story on­line and am so in­spired by your drive and ded­i­ca­tion to turn­ing your dreams into re­al­ity,” the Wildest Dreams (2015) singer wrote af­ter do­nat­ing £23,373.</p>
    <p>“I want to gift you the rest of your goal amount. Good luck with every­thing you do! Love, Tay­lor.”</p>
    <p>Swift, 30, made no pub­lic state­ment about the do­na­tion, but her of­fi­cial Twit­ter ac­count liked a tweet about the story posted by one of Ms Mario’s friends.</p>
    <p>Ms Mario said the do­na­tion “blew my mind”, telling BBC tele­vi­sion: “I call it a bless­ing.”</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to her GoFundMe page, Ms Mario moved to Lon­don four years ago from Por­tu­gal speak­ing no English, but got top marks in all her ex­ams. She set her­self a tar­get of raising £40,000 for univer­sity ac­com­mo­da­tion and liv­ing costs over four years – which she has now ex­ceeded.</p>
    <p>“Sadly, my fa­ther has passed away and my mother re­mains in Por­tu­gal. Mov­ing away from her was a chal­lenge, but it was a sacri­fice worth be­ing made, in my fam­ily’s eyes,” she wrote.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to United States me­dia, Swift has made other im­promptu do­na­tions to fans.</p>
    <p>Since the pan­demic be­gan, she has sent a box of mer­chan­dise to a nurse in Utah and helped sup­port work­ers at a shut­tered Nashville record store.</p>
