    <p>Hong Kong res­i­dents have been urged to stay home as the city braces it­self for what could be the worst Covid-19 wave to hit it so far.</p>
    <p>Speak­ing at her weekly me­dia con­fer­ence yes­ter­day, Chief Ex­ec­u­tive Car­rie Lam urged peo­ple to stay at home and avoid un­nec­es­sary fam­ily gath­er­ings.</p>
    <p>“The next two weeks will be crit­i­cal, so, un­less nec­es­sary, I hope res­i­dents can stay at home, es­pe­cially the el­derly. Peo­ple should avoid so­cial gath­er­ings, even if at home,” she said.</p>
    <p>Mrs Lam added that the gov­ern­ment is now look­ing at the pos­si­bil­ity of rais­ing the cur­rent fine of HK$2,000 (S$346) for in­di­vid­u­als who breach so­cial dis­tanc­ing mea­sures.</p>
    <p>Hong Kong has reg­is­tered a to­tal of al­most 6,400 Covid-19 cases so far, in­clud­ing 109 deaths.</p>
    <p>The num­ber of daily new in­fec­tions has crossed 70 for more than a week.</p>
    <p>This spike was ini­tially the re­sult of a grow­ing num­ber of in­fec­tions linked to a dance club clus­ter of more than 500, most of whom are tai tais and their young danc­ing in­struc­tors.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, the health au­thor­i­ties said the city added 82 new coro­n­avirus cases, with 72 of them lo­cal and 23 with un­known sources.</p>
    <p>The health au­thor­i­ties also or­dered 900 peo­ple work­ing at a Tse­ung Kwan O con­struc­tion site to get tested.</p>
    <p>Dr Chuang Shuk Kwan of the Cen­tre for Health Pro­tec­tion said the virus is eas­ily spread at such sites.</p>
    <p>“There is a lot of per­son-to-per­son con­tact in the con­struc­tion site. Not ev­ery­one can wear a mask as it’s hot some­times or they work in an en­closed en­vi­ron­ment,” she noted.</p>
    <p>Pro­fes­sor Ben Cowling, an in­fec­tious disease ex­pert from The Univer­sity of Hong Kong, said he was ex­pect­ing the fourth wave to be­gin sooner when mea­sures were re­laxed in Septem­ber as there is al­ways a risk of trans­mis­sion resurg­ing if in­fec­tions are rein­tro­duced.</p>
    <p>“I think the pri­or­ity now has to be to strengthen so­cial dis­tanc­ing mea­sures, tak­ing ref­er­ence from the mea­sures that were ef­fec­tive in cur­tail­ing the se­cond and third waves in March to April and July to Au­gust, re­spec­tively. That in­cludes rec­om­mend­ing civil ser­vants to work from home, and clos­ing gyms and other leisure fa­cil­i­ties,” he said.</p>
    <p>In the past week, the gov­ern­ment has is­sued a se­ries of or­ders, from man­dat­ing dance club vis­i­tors to go for com­pul­sory tests to or­der­ing pa­trons of spe­cific eater­ies to also get tested, as the coro­n­avirus cir­cu­lates.</p>
    <p>A restau­rant in Tsim Sha Tsui was also added to the list of venues whose vis­i­tors are re­quired to un­dergo test­ing for Covid-19. The gov­ern­ment is ask­ing peo­ple who have been to Pine Tree Hill Seafood Restau­rant in the past two weeks to get tested.</p>
    <p>The city has ad­di­tion­ally an­nounced tighter re­stric­tions on pub­lic gath­er­ing.</p>
    <p>Start­ing to­day and for two weeks, dine-in ser­vices will end two hours ear­lier at 10pm, with pa­trons capped at two per ta­ble.</p>
    <p>Bars, pubs, saunas, clubs, night­clubs and party rooms will re­main closed.</p>
    <p>All amuse­ment game cen­tres, leisure venues, mu­se­ums, cin­e­mas, theme parks, karaoke es­tab­lish­ments, mahjong clubs and swim­ming pools must be closed.</p>
    <p>Gyms, mas­sage and beauty par­lours can stay open but the num­ber of pa­trons must be capped at two, while civil ser­vants are to work from home and pub­lic gath­er­ings lim­ited to two.</p>
    <p>The city had ear­lier an­nounced that in-per­son classes at all kinder­gartens, as well as pri­mary and sec­ondary schools, will be sus­pended from to­day un­til the start of the schools’ Christ­mas break.</p>
    <p>This tight­en­ing of mea­sures comes as lo­cal trans­mis­sions, par­tic­u­larly among the city’s rich and pow­er­ful, have spread like wild­fire, ex­pand­ing af­ter some so­cialites linked di­rectly to the dance club clus­ter con­tin­ued to min­gle over meals and mahjong.</p>
    <p>SO­CIAL DIS­TANC­ING IS KEY</p>
    <p>I think the pri­or­ity now has to be to strengthen so­cial dis­tanc­ing mea­sures, tak­ing ref­er­ence from the mea­sures that were ef­fec­tive in cur­tail­ing the se­cond and third waves in March to April and July to Au­gust, re­spec­tively.</p>
    <p>That in­cludes rec­om­mend­ing civil ser­vants to work from home, and clos­ing gyms and other leisure fa­cil­i­ties.</p>
