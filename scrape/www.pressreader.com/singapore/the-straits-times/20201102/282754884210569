    <p>Wait­ing out­side the neona­tal in­ten­sive care unit at the Sin­ga­pore Gen­eral Hos­pi­tal in Septem­ber 2017, Ran­dall Tan and Melody Chen read the thank-you cards sent by par­ents of pre­ma­ture ba­bies.</p>
    <p>Some had spent more than 100 days in the unit, the cou­ple read in dis­be­lief. Their own twins were on day 2 or day 3, af­ter a dra­matic emer­gency C-sec­tion at al­most 27 weeks.</p>
    <p>“You can’t even see the light at the end of the tun­nel,” re­calls Chen, 43, over Zoom. “You got thrown into the deep end and you’re swim­ming and hop­ing for the best.”</p>
    <p>See­ing Reuben, who weighed 995g, and Mae­gan, who was 890g, for the first time brought on mixed emo­tions for the new mum, who had been try­ing to con­ceive for nine years.</p>
    <p>“It was a mix be­tween ‘I’m glad they’re still sur­viv­ing’ yet I was over­whelmed with dev­as­ta­tion. I felt so bad that my ‘oven’ wasn’t work­ing and they had to go through all this,” says the for­mer ac­tress and host, who is cur­rently self-em­ployed.</p>
    <p>The celebrity cou­ple had all but given up hope af­ter a mis­car­riage in 2013 and a failed in-vitro fer­til­i­sa­tion cy­cle in 2017 when Chen got preg­nant in the same year, and with twins. Nei­ther Chen nor Tan, who both acted in The Teenage Text­book Movie (1998), have a fam­ily his­tory of twins.</p>
    <p>Reuben re­turned home af­ter about 60 days, which al­lowed his par­ents to ease into their new role with just one baby. Mae­gan, who had sleep ap­nea – a com­mon pre­emie con­di­tion where ba­bies stop breath­ing dur­ing sleep – stayed in the neona­tal in­ten­sive care unit for about 90 days, but made it home in time for Christ­mas that year. “It was a bit of an ex­cit­ing/manic/happy time,” says Tan, 47, a brand am­bas­sador for The Ma­callan whiskey.</p>
    <p>The trial by fire strength­ened the cou­ple’s mar­riage as they had to be there for each other.</p>
    <p>“From the start, we re­alised we had to be a su­per team. Not just a team but a su­per team, to han­dle what­ever came our way,” says Tan, who played cook, cleaner, nanny and breast-milk courier for a pe­riod un­til the con­fine­ment nanny and maid ar­rived.</p>
    <p>Chen says: “There’s no one else I could have done this with.”</p>
    <p>They are thank­ful that the trau­matic first two years, which were “all full of check-ups”, as Chen puts it, are be­hind them.</p>
    <p>Now aged three, Reuben and Mae­gan are grow­ing well and have been dis­charged from rou­tine fol­lowups for speech ther­apy and phys­io­ther­apy. They even honed their mo­tor skills dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker.</p>
    <p>While some may pre­fer not to check their pre­emie’s devel­op­ment mile­stones, Chen sees such mark­ers as tes­ta­ment to the many “small wins” her twins have chalked up. “I’m not com­par­ing like, why is this so slow. I’m com­par­ing like ‘wow, you can al­ready do this when I ex­pected you to do it later’.”</p>
