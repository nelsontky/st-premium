    <p>•</p>
    <p>In­dia de­ployed hun­dreds of po­lice and para­mil­i­tary forces at a New Delhi bor­der yes­ter­day as thou­sands of farm­ers from neigh­bour­ing states blocked ma­jor roads into the cap­i­tal, in a protest against agri­cul­tural dereg­u­la­tion.</p>
    <p>A day after clashes ended with a deal that the farm­ers could demon­strate in the cap­i­tal, ten­sions rose again over laws that farm­ers fear could rob them of min­i­mum guar­an­teed prices for their pro­duce.</p>
    <p>Farm­ers who ar­rived in trucks, buses and trac­tors at Delhi’s Singhu bor­der with Haryana state on Fri­day blocked the main north­ern high­way into the cap­i­tal yes­ter­day morn­ing, chant­ing slo­gans against Prime Min­is­ter Naren­dra Modi’s govern­ment and wav­ing the red, yel­low and green flags of farm­ers’ unions.</p>
    <p>They ap­peared ready for a long sit-in and re­fused to re­lo­cate to a des­ig­nated protest site, rais­ing fears of fresh clashes be­tween se­cu­rity forces and protesters.</p>
    <p>On Fri­day, po­lice fired tear gas and water can­non to dis­perse the protesters be­fore let­ting them march into the cap­i­tal and stage a protest at a des­ig­nated site.</p>
    <p>Both se­cu­rity forces and farm­ers have in­stalled bar­ri­cades to pre­vent a re­peat of Fri­day’s clashes.</p>
    <p>Mr Harb­ha­jan Singh, 75, from Amritsar in the north­ern farm­ing state of Pun­jab, said he and oth­ers were car­ry­ing pro­vi­sions and were pre­pared to camp out.</p>
    <p>“We have been ha­rassed by the govern­ment. We want a spe­cial Par­lia­ment ses­sion for with­drawal of the new farm laws,” he said, adding that he hopes farm­ers from other states will join the protests.</p>
    <p>Op­po­si­tion Congress Party leader Rahul Gandhi also slammed the govern­ment.</p>
    <p>“Our slo­gan was ‘Hail the Soldier, Hail the Farmer’, but today PM Modi’s ar­ro­gance made the soldier stand against the farmer. This is very dan­ger­ous,” Mr Gandhi tweeted in re­ac­tion to a photo of a po­lice­man at­tempt­ing to hit a farmer with a ba­ton.</p>
    <p>Mr Modi’s laws, en­acted in Septem­ber, al­low farm­ers to sell their pro­duce freely, in­clud­ing to big cor­po­rate buy­ers, and not just at govern­ment-reg­u­lated whole­sale mar­kets. But many small grow­ers worry they will be left vul­ner­a­ble to big busi­ness and could lose price sup­ports for key sta­ples like wheat.</p>
