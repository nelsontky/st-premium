    <p>A “dra­matic” preg­nancy brought on by get­ting Covid-19 when she was preg­nant ended in tears of joy when Mrs Celine Ng-Chan, 31, gave birth to her sec­ond child ear­lier this month.</p>
    <p>To the pri­vate tu­tor’s re­lief, her son, Aldrin, was not only born free of Covid-19, he even has an­ti­bod­ies against the virus, ac­cord­ing to his pae­di­a­tri­cian.</p>
    <p>Mrs Ng-Chan is one of a few women in Sin­ga­pore who were in­fected with the coro­n­avirus dur­ing their preg­nan­cies to have given birth so far.</p>
    <p>She said: “It’s very in­ter­est­ing. His pae­di­a­tri­cian said my Covid-19 an­ti­bod­ies are gone but Aldrin has Covid-19 an­ti­bod­ies.</p>
    <p>“My doc­tor sus­pects I have trans­ferred my Covid-19 an­ti­bod­ies to him dur­ing my preg­nancy.”</p>
    <p>The Sun­day Times un­der­stands Aldrin’s an­ti­bod­ies sug­gest that he has im­mu­nity to the virus.</p>
    <p>Weigh­ing 3.5kg at birth, he was born on Nov 7 at the Na­tional Univer­sity Hos­pi­tal (NUH), and looked ex­actly like his elder sis­ter, Ald­rina, two, at her birth, Mrs NgChan added.</p>
    <p>“I have al­ways wanted a boy as I res­onate very well with boys, hav­ing three younger broth­ers in my fam­ily,” she said.</p>
    <p>Mrs Ng-Chan said her preg­nancy was a dra­matic one as she, her mother and her daugh­ter all con­tracted Covid-19 after re­turn­ing from a fam­ily hol­i­day in Europe in March.</p>
    <p>Her hus­band and fa­ther, who were on the trip as well, es­caped in­fec­tion.</p>
    <p>Her mother, Madam Choy Wai Chee, 58, came close to death.</p>
    <p>The of­fice man­ager was hos­pi­talised for four months and spent 29 days on a life sup­port ma­chine.</p>
    <p>Mrs Ng-Chan and Ald­rina were only mildly ill and were dis­charged from hos­pi­tal after 21/ weeks.</p>
    <p>When she was di­ag­nosed with Covid-19, Mrs Ng-Chan was 10 weeks preg­nant.</p>
    <p>She said: “I wasn’t wor­ried that Aldrin would get Covid-19 as I read that the trans­mis­sion risk (from mother to the foe­tus) is very low.”</p>
    <p>She was also aware of an­other cou­ple, Mrs Natasha Ling and her hus­band Pele, who were ex­pect­ing their first child when they both fell ill with Covid-19 in March.</p>
    <p>Mrs Ling, a 29-year-old speech and lan­guage ther­a­pist, tested pos­i­tive for the coro­n­avirus in her 36th week of preg­nancy.</p>
    <p>She gave birth to Boaz on April 26 at NUH. He is pos­si­bly the first baby born in Sin­ga­pore with Covid-19 an­ti­bod­ies.</p>
    <p>It is not known how many ba­bies in Sin­ga­pore have been born to women who had Covid-19 while they were preg­nant.</p>
    <p>Chair­man of the ob­stet­rics and gy­nae­col­ogy di­vi­sion at KK Women’s and Chil­dren’s Hos­pi­tal (KKH), As­so­ciate Pro­fes­sor Tan Hak Koon, told The Sun­day Times that the num­ber of preg­nant women in­fected with Covid-19 un</p>
    <p>der the hos­pi­tal’s care is “very low”, and none has as yet given birth.</p>
    <p>Prof Tan said guide­lines pub­lished by the Royal Col­lege of Ob­ste­tri­cians and Gy­nae­col­o­gists in Bri­tain last month said cur­rent ev­i­dence sug­gests that trans­mis­sion of Covid-19 from a woman to her baby dur­ing preg­nancy or birth is un­com­mon.</p>
    <p>Cur­rent ev­i­dence shows that whether the new­born in­fant catches Covid-19 from his mother is not af­fected by the mode of de­liv­ery, feed­ing choice such as breast or bot­tle feed­ing, or if the mother and baby stayed in the same room after de­liv­ery.</p>
    <p>At NUH, a spokesman said ba­bies born to women who have re­cov­ered from Covid-19 are as­sessed com­pre­hen­sively by a team of doc­tors.</p>
    <p>Gen­er­ally, in­va­sive test­ing for Covid-19 would not be re­quired for a healthy asymp­to­matic baby if the mother had the dis­ease ear­lier in her preg­nancy, com­pletely re­cov­ered and sub­se­quently tested neg­a­tive, like Mrs Ng-Chan.</p>
    <p>With­out spec­i­fy­ing num­bers, the spokesman added that ma­ter­nal and um­bil­i­cal cord blood is pro­cessed us­ing the stan­dard poly­merase chain re­ac­tion, and so far all the mother-new­born pairs have tested neg­a­tive.</p>
    <p>Mrs Ng-Chan said she was filled with joy and grat­i­tude over the new ad­di­tion to her fam­ily.</p>
    <p>“My preg­nancy and birth was smooth sail­ing de­spite be­ing di­ag­nosed with Covid-19 in my first trimester, which is the most un­sta­ble stage of the preg­nancy.</p>
    <p>“I’m very blessed to have Aldrin and he came out very healthy,” she said.</p>
    <p>“I feel re­lieved my Covid-19 jour­ney is fi­nally over now.”</p>
    <p>NO HIC­CUPS</p>
    <p>My preg­nancy and birth was smooth sail­ing de­spite be­ing di­ag­nosed with Covid-19 in my first trimester, which is the most un­sta­ble stage of the preg­nancy. I’m very blessed to have Aldrin and he came out very healthy.</p>
