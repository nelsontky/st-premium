    <p>Busi­nesses will now be able to bill and make pay­ment to one an­other in a seam­less on­line fash­ion, as Sin­ga­pore con­tin­ues its dig­i­tal push amid the Covid-19 out­break. This comes with the in­te­gra­tion of PayNow Cor­po­rate, an in­stant fund trans­fer ser­vice for busi­nesses, into Sin­ga­pore’s na­tion­wide ein­voic­ing net­work, the In­fo­comm Me­dia De­vel­op­ment Au­thor­ity (IMDA) said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>IMDA worked with ma­jor lo­cal banks DBS Bank, OCBC Bank and United Over­seas Bank to de­velop the so­lu­tion.</p>
    <p>Pre­vi­ously, af­ter re­ceiv­ing an e-in­voice, com­pa­nies would still have to take an ex­tra step for pay­ment such as log­ging in through their bank’s In­ter­net bank­ing plat­form, wiring a bank trans­fer or writ­ing a cheque.</p>
    <p>They now need only click on a link pro­vided with the e-in­voice, which will di­rect them to a pay­ment por­tal with all the rel­e­vant in­for­ma­tion and items au­to­mat­i­cally filled up, check if the amount billed is cor­rect, and then send in­stant pay­ment to the busi­ness’ unique en­tity num­ber (UEN). The in­stant pay­ment is pos­si­ble as PayNow Cor­po­rate, launched in 2018, links bank ac­count num­bers to UENs.</p>
    <p>E-in­voic­ing is the au­to­mated cre­ation, ex­change and pro­cess­ing of re­quests for pay­ments be­tween sup­pli­ers and buy­ers us­ing a stan­dard­ised dig­i­tal for­mat. It does away with ex­ist­ing digi­tised in­voices, such as com­puter print­outs, PDF doc­u­ments or scanned in­voices which re­quire some level of hu­man in­put to process.</p>
    <p>The e-in­voic­ing net­work, now known as In­voiceNow, was rolled out last year.</p>
    <p>More than 25,000 busi­nesses have joined the net­work, up from 1,000 in March. “Within the past three months, we have seen an ex­po­nen­tial in­crease in busi­nesses com­ing on board e-in­voic­ing,” said IMDA as­sis­tant chief ex­ec­u­tive Jane Lim. “Our aim is to drive fur­ther adop­tion to ben­e­fit more busi­nesses.”</p>
    <p>IMDA said the billing and pay­ment in­te­gra­tion also works with other modes of e-pay­ment, es­pe­cially for over­seas busi­nesses that do not have PayNow. Adopt­ing e-in­voic­ing is one of the con­di­tions for com­pa­nies to be el­i­gi­ble for a pay­out of up to $10,000 un­der the Dig­i­tal Re­silience Bonus, which was an­nounced in May.</p>
    <p>Com­pa­nies that reg­is­ter for In­voiceNow on or be­fore Dec 31 will also be able to re­ceive a grant of $200, paid through PayNow Cor­po­rate.</p>
