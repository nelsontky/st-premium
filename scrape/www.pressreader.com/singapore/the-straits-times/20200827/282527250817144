    <p>When the fan­tasy series Lucifer pre­miered in 2016, sev­eral Chris­tian groups called for it to be can­celled or boy­cotted, out­raged that the devil him­self was the pro­tag­o­nist – and that he was por­trayed as hand­some, charm­ing and not ex­actly evil.</p>
    <p>Based on a DC Comics char­ac­ter cre­ated by Neil Gaiman for The Sand­man graphic nov­els, the story re­volves around the an­gel known as Lucifer Morn­ingstar – played by Tom El­lis – who is so bored of rul­ing Hell that he packs up and moves to Los An­ge­les to run a night­club.</p>
    <p>When he is not i ndulging i n earthly plea­sures, Lucifer helps lo­cal po­lice of­fi­cers such as de­tec­tive Chloe Decker (Lau­ren Ger­man) solve crimes. And he grad­u­ally starts de­vel­op­ing hu­man emo­tions – in­clud­ing some com­pli­cated ones for Chloe.</p>
    <p>But El­lis and the creators say their series – which has been the most-watched show on Net­flix in the United States and Sin­ga­pore since it de­buted its fifth sea­son on Aug 21 – is re­ally about re­demp­tion and good tri­umph­ing over evil rather than elic­it­ing sym­pa­thy for the devil.</p>
    <p>In an e-mail in­ter­view with The Straits Times, writer-pro­ducer Joe Hen­der­son says he thinks this is why the early furore among some Chris­tians – which iron­i­cally helped pub­li­cise the show – even­tu­ally died down.</p>
    <p>“I think a lot of the rea­son is be­cause peo­ple ac­tu­ally watched the show and saw we weren’t what they as­sumed we were.</p>
    <p>“We’re a show about re­demp­tion and good win­ning out – what’s more Chris­tian than those ideas? I know so many peo­ple of faith who have dis­cov­ered and grown to love the show over the years.”</p>
    <p>El­lis agrees. “Most of our reli­gious crit­ics sur­faced be­fore we even aired, which to me sug­gests a lot more about those peo­ple than it does our show.</p>
    <p>“I grew up in the church and never once wor­ried that we were do­ing some­thing wrong or blas­phe­mous,” says the 41-year-old Bri­tish ac­tor.</p>
    <p>His favourite fan feed­back is “from peo­ple of faith who have man­aged to take some­thing pos­i­tive from watch­ing it”.</p>
    <p>And Lucifer’s fans are a pas­sion­ate bunch.</p>
    <p>Af­ter mid­dling re­views and rat­ings for its first three sea­sons, the show was can­celled by Fox, the Amer­i­can net­work it orig­i­nally aired on.</p>
    <p>But the fan out­cry and re­sult­ing #SaveLu­cifer so­cial me­dia cam­paign prompted Net­flix to ac­quire it and make a fourth sea­son.</p>
    <p>The stream­ing ser­vice has now re­newed the pop­u­lar ti­tle for a sixth, which will be its last.</p>
    <p>Ildy Mo­drovich, an­other writer and pro­ducer, re­calls how stunned the cast and crew were when fans ral­lied to save the series.</p>
    <p>“The sur­prise was that peo­ple were ac­tu­ally watch­ing. I mean, get­ting can­celled is usu­ally a sign that maybe you’re not ex­actly killing it,” she says.</p>
    <p>“So when the Save Lucifer cam­paign hap­pened, we were shocked and thrilled. We had no idea we had such a lovely fan base out there, it was the fact that they or­gan­ised and banded to­gether that made us aware.”</p>
    <p>El­lis was stunned too. “I’ve worked in this in­dus­try for 20 years and I have never ex­pe­ri­enced any­thing like that be­fore.</p>
    <p>“But to be hon­est, Fox did us a huge favour be­cause the show has re­ally come into its own on Net­flix. And our fans now feel like share­hold­ers in the show, which is lovely.”</p>
    <p>And for the ac­tor, the most im­por­tant el­e­ments of the series have lit­tle to do with its bi­b­li­cal ori­gins.</p>
    <p>“I never got bogged down in the whole devil side of things. I tried to ap­proach Lucifer as I would any other char­ac­ter, which means hav­ing to find some em­pa­thy for him.</p>
    <p>“To me, he was just a hurt son who was la­belled by his dad and, as a re­sult, no one un­der­stood him.”</p>
    <p>But the show never takes it­self too se­ri­ously, El­lis adds.</p>
    <p>“I’ve al­ways thought the hu­mour and the heart of Lucifer is the rea­son the show works. It has a know­ing­ness about it that lets the au­di­ence in on the joke and means we are able to get away with the things we do.</p>
    <p>“That cou­pled with how much we end up car­ing about our char­ac­ters means our au­di­ence is laugh­ing one minute and cry­ing the next, which is just the kind of sto­ry­telling I love.”</p>
