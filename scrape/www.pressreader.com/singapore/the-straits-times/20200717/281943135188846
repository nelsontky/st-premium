    <p>Sin­ga­pore’s sec­ond-quar­ter gross do­mes­tic prod­uct (GDP) growth num­bers were ex­pected to be dis­mal, given that the three months cov­ered most of the cir­cuit breaker pe­riod from April 7 to June 1, when non-es­sen­tial ser­vices were sus­pended and most work­places closed. But the re­al­ity turned out to be even worse than ex­pected, with the econ­omy shrink­ing a record 12.6 per cent year on year, com­pared with a con­sen­sus fore­cast by economists of mi­nus 10.5 per cent. The quar­ter-on-quar­ter con­trac­tion was an eye-pop­ping 41.2 per cent – an­other record – which con­firmed that for the first time since the global fi­nan­cial cri­sis of 2009, the econ­omy has slid into re­ces­sion, de­fined as two con­sec­u­tive quar­ters of neg­a­tive growth.</p>
    <p>The lift­ing of the cir­cuit breaker from June on­wards kin­dles hopes of some recovery in the sec­ond half of this year, but it is likely to be slow and un­even. In par­tic­u­lar, in­dus­tries that de­pend on open bor­ders, in­clud­ing avi­a­tion, tourism and hos­pi­tal­ity, will re­main in dire straits, while oth­ers such as re­tail, food and bev­er­age, and en­ter­tain­ment will con­tinue to be weak be­cause of so­cial dis­tanc­ing mea­sures and con­sumer cau­tion. The con­struc­tion sec­tor, which suf­fered a bruis­ing de­cline of 54.7 per cent year on year in the sec­ond quar­ter, will likely con­tinue to be con­strained by a short­age of for­eign work­ers, many of whom re­main con­fined to their dor­mi­to­ries.</p>
    <p>How­ever, on the pos­i­tive side, the man­u­fac­tur­ing sec­tor, which man­aged to eke out year-onyear growth of 2.5 per cent in the sec­ond quar­ter, should start to gain mo­men­tum, de­spite some con­tin­ued dis­rup­tions in sup­ply chains. En­cour­ag­ingly, China’s econ­omy, to which parts of man­u­fac­tur­ing are closely linked, turned in a bet­terthan-ex­pected growth of 3.2 per cent in the sec­ond quar­ter, and the pur­chas­ing man­agers’ in­dices for do­mes­tic man­u­fac­tur­ing and elec­tron­ics im­proved in May and June, which point to a brighter out­look for the rest of the year.</p>
    <p>The econ­omy will also be buoyed to some ex­tent by the Gov­ern­ment’s mul­ti­ple stim­u­lus pack­ages, the col­lec­tive im­pact of which was not fully re­flected in the sec­ond-quar­ter fig­ures.</p>
    <p>Hope­fully, GDP has bot­tomed out, now that the econ­omy has be­gun to get go­ing again. But even so, a ma­jor con­cern for pol­i­cy­mak­ers will con­tinue to be jobs, which will be slow to come back, as lay­offs in hard-hit sec­tors will gather pace and em­ploy­ers will be cau­tious to re­hire or ex­pand op­er­a­tions. There will also be dif­fi­cul­ties match­ing job seek­ers – who will be mainly low-wage and low-skilled – with va­can­cies, many of which are for higher-skilled, dig­i­tally savvy work­ers. Bar­ring a resur­gence in the out­break, the sec­ond half of the year will hope­fully be bet­ter than the first. But work­ers, es­pe­cially those re­trenched, will con­tinue to face a dif­fi­cult time in the months ahead.</p>
