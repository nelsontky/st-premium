    <p>Aries (March 21 - April 19)</p>
    <p>It is a great time to meet new people – you are quite likely to run into some­one from far off whom you would never have ex­pected. It is a great time to round out your grow­ing list of friends.</p>
    <p>Tau­rus (April 20 - May 20)</p>
    <p>Your sub­con­scious mind is caus­ing all sorts of in­ter­est­ing prob­lems and some of them may prove to be quite handy. See if you can get your people to cover for you as you ex­plore your in­ner space.</p>
    <p>Gem­ini (May 21 - June 20)</p>
    <p>You and a col­league or client are see­ing things eye to eye, maybe for the first time in a while. You should try to get him to deal with what­ever prob­lem has been plagu­ing you both.</p>
    <p>Can­cer (June 21 - July 22)</p>
    <p>Your col­leagues are mak­ing your life weird, even if you are not at work or look­ing for a gig. It may be time for you to con­sider a big change in your ca­reer tra­jec­tory.</p>
    <p>Leo (July 23 - Aug 22)</p>
    <p>You need a change and you can make that hap­pen with ease. It is one of those days when you have to break the chains one way or another and you can do it with a smile.</p>
    <p>Virgo (Aug 23 - Sept 22)</p>
    <p>You may not want to do what you know needs to be done, but you need to force your­self. Things are good, but you should be able to im­prove them if you find the in­ner dis­ci­pline.</p>
    <p>Li­bra (Sept 23 - Oct 22)</p>
    <p>Your brain is itch­ing with new ideas, so make sure you have the time and en­ergy to work them out. You may want to spend more time think­ing than act­ing – you can catch up later.</p>
    <p>Scor­pio (Oct 23 - Nov 21)</p>
    <p>You have to be wary of that risky propo­si­tion com­ing your way this morn­ing – it looks much safer than it re­ally is. It could still work out, but you are putting a lot on the line.</p>
    <p>Sagit­tar­ius (Nov 22 - Dec 21)</p>
    <p>Your en­ergy is flow­ing strongly and you ought to be able to get your people to share your spirit of ex­plo­ration. Go some­where new or try an ac­tiv­ity that has al­ways been out of reach.</p>
    <p>Capri­corn (Dec 22 - Jan 19)</p>
    <p>Your ide­al­ism is mak­ing life harder, yet more en­ter­tain­ing. You may achieve a break­through when you break the ten­sion be­tween what you be­lieve and what you have to do.</p>
    <p>Aquar­ius (Jan 20 - Feb 18)</p>
    <p>Some­one new makes your day a lit­tle brighter, prob­a­bly fairly early. Make room, es­pe­cially if you do not know him or her well. If that is the case, make it your mis­sion to learn more.</p>
    <p>Pisces (Feb 19 - March 20)</p>
    <p>Work is­sues are both­er­ing you, but that could mean that you need to deal with the sit­u­a­tion in a bold new way. Get your friends or fam­ily to help you with your search, if that is what you de­cide.</p>
