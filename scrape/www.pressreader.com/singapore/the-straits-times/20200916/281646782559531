    <p>The Covid-19 pan­demic has pro­vided more im­pe­tus for Sin­ga­pore to cham­pion in­te­gra­tion for the Asean economies, Dr Tan See Leng, Sec­ond Min­is­ter for Trade and In­dus­try, said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>“The Asean re­gion, with its promis­ing long-term growth po­ten­tial... presents mul­ti­ple op­por­tu­ni­ties not just for Sin­ga­pore busi­nesses, but also for for­eign di­rect in­vest­ment into Sin­ga­pore,” Dr Tan said of the group­ing with a pop­u­la­tion of about 650 mil­lion and is the fifth-largest econ­omy in the world.</p>
    <p>“With many coun­tries turn­ing in­wards, it is even more im­por­tant now for Sin­ga­pore and Asean to con­tinue to ad­vance re­gional in­te­gra­tion, to re­main com­mit­ted to an open and rules-based re­gional eco­nomic en­vi­ron­ment,” he added.</p>
    <p>Dr Tan, who is also Min­is­ter in the Prime Min­is­ter’s Of­fice and Sec­ond Min­is­ter for Man­power, was speak­ing on a panel ti­tled “Cap­i­tal­is­ing New World Or­der and Re­gion­al­ism Amidst More Dy­namic Global Re­la­tions” at the Fu­tureChina Global Fo­rum held online.</p>
    <p>Dr Tan said Sin­ga­pore is work­ing with Asean to stream­line non-tar­iff mea­sures, start­ing with those im­posed on essen­tial items such as food and med­i­cal sup­plies.</p>
    <p>Asean has also put in place cost-low­er­ing mea­sures to help fa­cil­i­tate trade in the re­gion, he said.</p>
    <p>One ex­am­ple is the Asean­wide Self-Cer­ti­fi­ca­tion regime, which starts on Sun­day.</p>
    <p>The regime al­lows cer­ti­fied ex­porters to self-cer­tify the ori­gin of their goods and thus en­joy pref­er­en­tial treat­ment un­der the Asean Trade in Goods Agree­ment. It aims to helps busi­nesses save costs as they will not need to ap­ply to the au­thor­i­ties for a hard-copy cer­tifi­cate.</p>
    <p>“We are also mov­ing to em­bark (on more) re­gional trade agree­ments so that we can foster closer re­gional eco­nomic in­te­gra­tion, at a time when most of the world seems to be go­ing down a more iso­la­tion­ist path,” he added.</p>
    <p>The panel was mod­er­ated by Straits Times as­so­ci­ate ed­i­tor Ravi Vel­loor.</p>
    <p>Also on the panel were Mr Dith Tina, Sec­re­tary of State at the Min­istry of Mines and En­ergy in Cam­bo­dia; Dr Ran­dall S. Kroszner, deputy dean of ex­ec­u­tive pro­grammes and Nor­man R. Bobins Pro­fes­sor of Eco­nom­ics at The Univer­sity of Chicago Booth School of Busi­ness; Mr Steven Ciobo, Aus­tralia’s for­mer min­is­ter for trade, tourism and in­vest­ment; and Mr Michael Ding, global ex­ec­u­tive di­rec­tor of green­tech firm En­vi­sion Group. Top­ics cov­ered in the hour-long ses­sion in­cluded sup­ply chain con­nec­tiv­ity, China’s econ­omy and the on­go­ing ten­sions be­tween China and the United States.</p>
    <p>COM­MIT TO STAY­ING OPEN</p>
    <p>With many coun­tries turn­ing in­wards, it is even more im­por­tant now for Sin­ga­pore and Asean to con­tinue to ad­vance re­gional in­te­gra­tion, to re­main com­mit­ted to an open and rules-based re­gional eco­nomic en­vi­ron­ment.</p>
    <p>SEC­OND MIN­IS­TER FOR TRADE AND IN­DUS­TRY TAN SEE LENG</p>
    <p>the next decade or so, and she is op­ti­mistic that this will pave the way for a more sus­tain­able growth model glob­ally.</p>
    <p>“We are see­ing the lead­ing edge of those mil­len­ni­als not want­ing just fi­nan­cial re­turns, putting all of their money in dou­ble-bottom-line and triple-bottom-line in­vest­ments be­cause they be­lieve – fun­da­men­tally and fer­vently – that they can use their cap­i­tal for the health of the planet, for ed­u­ca­tion,” she said.</p>
    <p>Other pan­el­lists at her ses­sion were Mi­crosoft ex­ec­u­tive vice-pres­i­dent Jean-Philippe Cour­tois, JP­Mor­gan Chase chief ex­ec­u­tive Jamie Di­mon, and in­fec­tious dis­eases spe­cial­ist and di­rec­tor of Well­come Trust health foun­da­tion Jeremy Far­rar.</p>
