    <p>Hum­ble dirt could pack an un­ex­pected cli­mate punch, ac­cord­ing to a study pub­lished in the jour­nal Na­ture. An ex­per­i­ment that heated soil un­derneath a trop­i­cal rain­for­est to mimic tem­per­a­tures ex­pected in the com­ing decades found that hot­ter soils re­leased 55 per cent more planet-warm­ing car­bon diox­ide than did nearby un­warmed ar­eas.</p>
    <p>If the re­sults ap­ply through­out the trop­ics, much of the car­bon stored un­der­ground could be re­leased as the planet heats up. “The loss rate is huge,” said Dr An­drew Not­ting­ham, an ecol­o­gist at the Uni­ver­sity of Ed­in­burgh, who led the study. “It’s a bad news story.”</p>
    <p>The thin skin of soil that cov­ers much of our planet’s land stores vast amounts of car­bon – more, in to­tal, than in all plants and the at­mos­phere com­bined.</p>
    <p>That car­bon feeds hordes of bac­te­ria and fungi, which build some of it into more mi­crobes while respir­ing the rest into the at­mos­phere as car­bon diox­ide. Many of these mi­crobes grow more ac­tive at warmer tem­per­a­tures, in­creas­ing di­ges­tion and res­pi­ra­tion rates.</p>
    <p>The find­ing “is an­other ex­am­ple of why we need to worry more” about how fast the globe is warm­ing, said Dr Eric David­son, an en­vi­ron­men­tal sci­en­tist at the Uni­ver­sity of Mary­land Cen­tre for En­vi­ron­men­tal Science in Frost­burg, who was not in­volved in the re­search.</p>
    <p>In an at­tempt to fore­cast the fu­ture, ecol­o­gists be­gan, in the early 1990s, build­ing ap­pa­ra­tuses to ar­ti­fi­cially heat soils. Such ex­per­i­ments in tem­per­ate and bo­real forests have shown that car­bon-rich soils al­most al­ways belch car­bon diox­ide when warmed.</p>
    <p>In 2016, a group of re­searchers es­ti­mated that, by 2050, soils could re­lease so much of the planet-warm­ing gas that it would be like adding the car­bon emis­sions of a new coun­try the size of the United States.</p>
    <p>But that study left out the per­pet­u­ally warm, mega-bio­di­verse trop­ics, where a third of all soil car­bon re­sides. Fig­ur­ing out the fate of this car­bon would re­quire grap­pling with the many pit­falls of do­ing re­search in the trop­ics: hu­mid­ity, storms and a mul­ti­tude of hun­gry an­i­mals that can take a toll on re­search equip­ment – chew­ing through elec­tri­cal wires or pro­tec­tive cov­er­ings, for ex­am­ple – and on re­searchers them­selves.</p>
    <p>For un­der­stand­ing soils’ con­tri­bu­tions to cli­mate change, the trop­ics “is a re­ally im­por­tant re­gion” that “re­ally hasn’t been stud­ied”, said Dr Mar­garet Torn, an ecol­o­gist at Lawrence Berkeley Lab in Cal­i­for­nia, who was not in­volved in the study.</p>
    <p>In 2014, Dr Not­ting­ham, then a post­doc­toral fel­low at the Uni­ver­sity of Ed­in­burgh, trav­elled to Barro Colorado Is­land, a hu­man-cre­ated is­land in the Panama Canal area that is home to the Smith­so­nian Trop­i­cal Re­search In­sti­tute. He buried elec­tri­cal wires in five cir­cu­lar plots to a depth of nearly 1.2m. For pro­tec­tion from the el­e­ments and rav­en­ous in­sects, he shielded the wires in­side metal struc­tures shaped like freak­ishly large spi­ders. Mea­sure­ments were logged in­side weath­er­proof boxes.</p>
    <p>“Our ex­per­i­ment was ba­si­cally me as a post­doc mak­ing things out of a DIY shop,” Dr Not­ting­ham said.</p>
    <p>The team en­coun­tered a number of hic­cups, in­clud­ing poor elec­tri­cal con­nec­tions that blew up and cost the re­searchers nearly a year and much of their bud­get to re­pair.</p>
    <p>Start­ing in Novem­ber 2016, the elec­tri­cal re­sis­tance of the wires be­gan warm­ing the soil by al­most 6 deg F, within the range of how much the trop­ics are pro­jected to warm by cen­tury’s end ac­cord­ing to cur­rent cli­mate mod­els.</p>
    <p>Other equip­ment mea­sured the car­bon diox­ide com­ing out of both the ex­per­i­men­tal plots and nearby plots that were not ar­ti­fi­cially warmed, as well as mi­cro­bial ac­tiv­ity in the plots.</p>
    <p>An ex­per­i­ment warm­ing soil in El Yunque National For­est in Puerto Rico had started two months ear­lier</p>
    <p>That car­bon feeds hordes of bac­te­ria and fungi, which build some of it into more mi­crobes while respir­ing the rest into the at­mos­phere as car­bon diox­ide. Many of these mi­crobes grow more ac­tive at warmer tem­per­a­tures, in­creas­ing di­ges­tion and res­pi­ra­tion rates.</p>
    <p>but was pum­melled by back-to­back Cat­e­gory 5 hur­ri­canes in Septem­ber 2017; the study team did not turn the power back on for a year.</p>
    <p>The re­sults from Dr Not­ting­ham’s team are sober­ing: Over two years, warmed soils spewed out 55 per cent more car­bon than con­trol plots.</p>
    <p>“This is a very large re­sponse,” said Dr Torn, who runs a sim­i­lar warm­ing ex­per­i­ment in a Cal­i­for­nia for­est that re­ported a roughly 35 per cent in­crease in car­bon emis­sions af­ter two years. “It’s one of the largest I’ve heard of.”</p>
    <p>If the en­tire trop­ics were to be­have sim­i­larly, the re­searchers es­ti­mate that 65 bil­lion met­ric tons of car­bon would en­ter the at­mos­phere by 2100 – more than six times the an­nual emis­sions from all hu­man-re­lated sources.</p>
    <p>Scal­ing the re­sults to ac­count for the en­tire trop­ics is com­pli­cated, how­ever. The soils on Barro Colorado Is­land are richer in nu­tri­ents than many oth­ers, such as those of much of the vast Ama­zon rain­for­est, Dr David­son noted. That could make it eas­ier for the Pana­ma­nian mi­crobes to ramp up their ac­tiv­ity. Mi­cro­bial com­mu­ni­ties in African and Asian soils are very dif­fer­ent from those in the Americas, Dr Torn said.</p>
    <p>And while there is agree­ment that cli­mate mod­els need to treat soil more re­al­is­ti­cally, how best to do that is un­clear. The new study strikes a blow against sim­ple the­o­ries pre­dict­ing that trop­i­cal soils will re­spond weakly to warm­ing, said Dr Kathe Todd-Brown, a soil sci­en­tist at the Uni­ver­sity of Florida in Gainesvill­e, who was not part of the re­search team. But to re­ally get a han­dle on the prob­lem, she said, mod­ellers will need in­for­ma­tion about how mi­crobes re­spond to</p>
    <p>The re­sults from Dr An­drew Not­ting­ham’s team are sober­ing: Over two years, warmed soils spewed out 55 per cent more car­bon than con­trol plots.</p>
    <p>Dr Mar­garet Torn, who runs a sim­i­lar warm­ing ex­per­i­ment in a Cal­i­for­nia for­est that re­ported a roughly 35 per cent in­crease in car­bon emis­sions af­ter two years, said: “It’s one of the largest (re­sponses) I’ve heard of.”</p>
    <p>vari­a­tions in soil mois­ture and nu­tri­ents in ad­di­tion to tem­per­a­ture.</p>
    <p>By warm­ing only the soil, the Barro Colorado Is­land ex­per­i­ment did not cap­ture how plants would fare un­der warmer con­di­tions, said Dr Tana Wood, a US For­est Ser­vice ecol­o­gist who is lead­ing the Puerto Rico ex­per­i­ment.</p>
    <p>If plants were to pho­to­syn­the­sise more, for ex­am­ple, they could take up some of the car­bon diox­ide that soils re­lease, mak­ing the over­all im­pact on the cli­mate less se­vere.</p>
    <p>“This is only telling half the car­bon story,” she said. (Her team is warm­ing both the soil and the air with in­frared heaters and mea­sur­ing how plants and mi­crobes re­spond.)</p>
    <p>Dr Torn said she was ea­ger to see more than two years’ worth of data, which could re­veal whether the car­bon diox­ide spike is pro­longed or short-lived. “In the life of a trop­i­cal for­est, that’s a very short time,” she noted.</p>
    <p>Dr Not­ting­ham has fund­ing to keep the Panama project run­ning for at least an­other five years.</p>
    <p>But even a short two-year pe­riod has shown how crit­i­cal it is to find ways to keep ecosys­tems in­tact, he said. “It makes you re­alise how for­tu­nate we’ve been up un­til this point to have a rel­a­tively sta­ble cli­mate.”</p>
