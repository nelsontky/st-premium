    <p>Ja­pan’s core con­sumer price in­dex fell 0.4 per cent last month from a year ear­lier. That com­pared with the me­dian mar­ket fore­cast for a 0.4 per cent de­cline and a flat read­ing in July and matched the level seen in Novem­ber 2016.</p>
    <p>TOKYO • Ja­pan’s core con­sumer prices fell at their fastest pace in al­most four years last month, dragged down mostly by gov­ern­ment-spon­sored dis­counts for do­mes­tic travel aimed at sup­port­ing the bat­tered tourism sec­tor.</p>
    <p>The weak con­sumer price data comes af­ter Bank of Ja­pan gov­er­nor Haruhiko Kuroda said on Thurs­day it would mon­i­tor not j ust price trends but job growth in guid­ing pol­icy, sig­nalling a readi­ness to ramp up stim­u­lus if job losses heighten the risk of de­fla­tion.</p>
    <p>Ja­pan’s new Prime Min­is­ter Yoshi­hide Suga on Wed­nes­day pledged to con­tain Covid-19 and re­tain his for­mer boss’ “Abe­nomics” growth poli­cies while push­ing re­forms such as dereg­u­la­tion and dig­i­tal­i­sa­tion.</p>
    <p>The core con­sumer price in­dex (CPI), which in­cludes oil prod­ucts but ex­cludes volatile fresh food prices, fell 0.4 per cent last month from a year ear­lier, gov­ern­ment data showed yes­ter­day. That com­pared with the me­dian mar­ket fore­cast for a 0.4 per cent de­cline and a flat read­ing in July and matched the level seen in Novem­ber 2016.</p>
    <p>The main fac­tor for the fall in the core CPI was a price de­cline in ac­com­mo­da­tion and ho­tels af­ter the gov­ern­ment launched sub­si­dies for na­tional travel dis­counts from late July to re­vive pan­demic-hit tourism.</p>
    <p>Prices of ac­com­mo­da­tion fell 32 per cent last month from a year ear­lier, the in­dex showed.</p>
    <p>“Down­ward pres­sure on con­sumer prices will likely con­tinue and the core CPI in­dex could fall to around 1 per cent year on year later this year,” said chief econ­o­mist Yoshiki Shinke at Dai-ichi Life Re­search In­sti­tute.</p>
    <p>He said the travel cam­paign will con­tinue to weigh on ac­com­mo­da­tion while the boost to prices from a sales tax hike im­ple­mented last Oc­to­ber will dis­ap­pear later this year.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, down­ward pres­sure on prices is broad­en­ing from the hit to de­mand caused by the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>The so-called core-core price in­dex, which ex­cludes food and en­ergy prices and is closely tracked by the cen­tral bank as a nar­rower gauge of in­fla­tion, fell 0.1 per cent last month, the first fall since March 2017. In July, the in­dex gained 0.4 per cent.</p>
    <p>Mr Shinke said: “There is also a pos­si­bil­ity that weak de­mand trig­gered by the coro­n­avirus out­break could push down con­sumer prices go­ing ahead, though we haven’t seen sig­nif­i­cant im­pact on con­sumer prices so far.”</p>
    <p>The econ­omy shrank an an­nu­alised 28.1 per cent in April-June, its big­gest post­war con­trac­tion.</p>
    <p>An­a­lysts see the re­open­ing of busi­nesses af­ter a na­tion­wide shut­down as sup­port­ing the econ­omy, but com­pa­nies and con­sumers re­main cau­tious about the coro­n­avirus out­break and the pace of re­cov­ery may be lim­ited.</p>
