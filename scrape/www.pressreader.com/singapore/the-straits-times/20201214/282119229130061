    <p>A for­mer full-time na­tional ser­vice­man with the Sin­ga­pore Civil De­fence Force (SCDF) will have to un­dergo manda­tory treat­ment for two years, af­ter he stole an am­bu­lance and drove it to his girl­friend’s con­do­minium.</p>
    <p>Haziq Syamim Esa, who has a his­tory of schiz­o­phrenic dis­or­der, was told by a dis­trict court last Fri­day that he will have to un­dergo treat­ment to ad­dress his men­tal con­di­tion in lieu of im­pris­on­ment.</p>
    <p>The 21-year-old was also dis­qual­i­fied from driv­ing all classes of ve­hi­cles for two years.</p>
    <p>Haziq had pleaded guilty last month to one count each of theft and cheat­ing. He also ad­mit­ted to an un­re­lated charge of caus­ing hurt to an­other per­son by per­form­ing a rash act.</p>
    <p>The in­ci­dent hap­pened on March 12 when Haziq cy­cled to Sengkang Fire Sta­tion dressed in an emer­gency med­i­cal ser­vices (EMS) T-shirt with black trousers.</p>
    <p>He told a sen­try of­fi­cer at the fire sta­tion that he was an off-duty EMS of­fi­cer and needed to speak to a col­league in­side.</p>
    <p>Haziq, who was al­lowed to en­ter the premises at around 3am, spot­ted an un­oc­cu­pied am­bu­lance with its en­gine run­ning. He en­tered the ve­hi­cle and drove it to The Amore con­do­minium in Pung­gol, to visit his girl­friend who lived there.</p>
    <p>When he reached the prop­erty, he turned on the am­bu­lance blinker lights and duped a se­cu­rity guard into be­liev­ing that there was a med­i­cal emer­gency.</p>
    <p>Deputy Pub­lic Pros­e­cu­tor Cheng Yuxi had said: “The ac­cused there­fore in­ten­tion­ally in­duced (the guard) to lift the bar­rier for the am­bu­lance to en­ter as it was an emer­gency ve­hi­cle.”</p>
    <p>SCDF of­fi­cers at the sta­tion dis­cov­ered the am­bu­lance miss­ing at around 4am and de­ployed a group of fire­fight­ers to look for it.</p>
    <p>They found the am­bu­lance at the con­do­minium later that morn­ing and Haziq was de­tained.</p>
    <p>His case in­volv­ing the rash act hap­pened on May 2.</p>
    <p>Haziq had driven a rented Toy­ota Prius to Gi­ant Hyper­mar­ket in Tampines North Drive 2 and ap­proached a cou­ple, af­ter telling a se­cu­rity guard that he was there to pick up pas­sen­gers.</p>
    <p>A taxi driver went up to him and told him that tout­ing was il­le­gal.</p>
    <p>An ar­gu­ment en­sued and Haziq re­turned to his ve­hi­cle. But the taxi driver tried to stop him from leav­ing by stand­ing in front of his car.</p>
    <p>Haziq then swerved the car to the right, hit­ting the cabby, who fell to the ground. Haziq drove off in­stead of stop­ping to ren­der as­sis­tance.</p>
    <p>The court heard that the taxi driver suf­fered scratches on his right el­bow.</p>
