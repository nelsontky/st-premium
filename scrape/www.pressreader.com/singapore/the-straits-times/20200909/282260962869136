    <p>ORLANDO • The Boston Celtics blew out the Toronto Rap­tors 111-89 on Mon­day, push­ing the reign­ing Na­tional Bas­ket­ball As­so­ci­a­tion cham­pi­ons to the brink of elim­i­na­tion.</p>
    <p>The Celtics, who had lost two straight as the Rap­tors clawed their way back into the best-of­seven se­ries, now have a 3-2 lead and can clinch a place in the East­ern Con­fer­ence Fi­nals with a win to­day.</p>
    <p>They dom­i­nated de­fen­sively to hold the Rap­tors to 20 per cent shoot­ing in the first quar­ter, emerg­ing from the open­ing pe­riod with a 25-11 lead.</p>
    <p>Toronto never re­cov­ered from the early body blow af­ter en­dur­ing one of their worst scor­ing play-off quar­ters in fran­chise his­tory, with Boston up 18-5 af­ter 8 1/ min­utes.</p>
    <p>2</p>
    <p>The Celtics’ 37 points in the sec­ond quar­ter were two more than the Rap­tors man­aged in all of the first half, trail­ing 62-35 at half­time.</p>
    <p>De­spite a no­tice­able uptick of en­ergy to start the third, there was too much ground to make up.</p>
    <p>Fred VanVleet led the Rap­tors with 18 points, while re­serve guard Nor­man Pow­ell added 16, but the rest of the team had a stinker, lead­ing to a spat be­tween Kyle Lowry and Serge Ibaka.</p>
    <p>On the bust-up, VanVleet said: “Kyle had his mo­ment with the ref. Serge had his mo­ment with Kyle. But we moved on, we moved past it. It hap­pens. We’re brothers.</p>
    <p>“It’s a lot at stake. There’s a lot on the line. Those type of things are go­ing to hap­pen. But it wasn’t as bad as it looked... That’s an ev­ery­day thing on our team. Guys just be­ing hon­est. We have a lot of pas­sion­ate guys. It’s just part of the process.”</p>
    <p>Lowry did not ex­pand on the clash, but ad­mit­ted they were not their usual selves at Dis­ney World, though he in­sisted the “bub­ble” was not play­ing on their minds.</p>
    <p>“Nope. We just didn’t play well enough,” the guard, who only had 10 points, said. “We weren’t as as­sertive as we should have been.”</p>
    <p>Boston coach Brad Stevens kept his starters in for much of the fourth quar­ter, com­fort­ably keep­ing the lead in dou­ble dig­its. But the Celtics, who were led by a game-high 27 points from Jaylen Brown, be­lieve Toronto will come out fight­ing for their lives to­day.</p>
    <p>“The job isn’t done,” said the for­ward, who also pulled down six re­bounds and made three of their five steals.</p>
    <p>“We’ve got to come out and play with the same in­ten­sity.”</p>
    <p>In the West, Paul Ge­orge scored 32 points and the Los An­ge­les Clip­pers turned up the heat de­fen­sively in a 113-107 vic­tory over the Den­ver Nuggets for a 2-1 lead in their semi­fi­nal se­ries.</p>
