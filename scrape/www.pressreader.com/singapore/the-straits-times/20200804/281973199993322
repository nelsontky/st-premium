    <p>The coro­n­avirus pan­demic has stress-tested the world. Be­yond chal­leng­ing hu­man for­ti­tude, na­tional health ser­vices and in­ter­na­tional ri­val­ries, it has forced a se­ries of moral choices.</p>
    <p>Many have pro­voked im­pas­sioned dis­agree­ment – over whether gov­ern­ments can force busi­nesses and schools to close and, most bit­terly and sur­pris­ingly, over whether be­ing asked to wear a sim­ple face mask in­fringes in­di­vid­ual liberty. The tough­est moral test lies ahead.</p>
    <p>The bio­med­i­cal in­dus­try and re­search fa­cil­i­ties around the world are pro­gress­ing to­wards cre­at­ing a vac­cine that would of­fer the best chance to end the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>But the moral dilem­mas pro­voked by the de­vel­op­ment and dis­tri­bu­tion of a vac­cine will drive ever deeper de­bates.</p>
    <p>The newly pub­lished Ethics And Pan­demics, an an­thol­ogy edited by phi­los­o­phy pro­fes­sor Mered­ith Schwartz of Ry­er­son Univer­sity in Toronto, presents con­trast­ing views of aca­demics, doc­tors and com­men­ta­tors along with a se­ries of im­pos­si­bly dif­fi­cult case stud­ies.</p>
    <p>HOW TO DE­VELOP IT?</p>
    <p>The United States gov­ern­ment says the Covid-19 vac­cine will be de­vel­oped “at warp speed”.</p>
    <p>But vac­cines take years to de­velop for good rea­son. A failed Covid-19 vac­cine not only fails to con­fer any ben­e­fits – it could even com­pro­mise con­fi­dence in other vac­ci­na­tions, threat­en­ing a re­turn of measles, po­lio and other plagues.</p>
    <p>Test­ing short­cuts are avail­able but fraught. The first rule of de­cid­ing when they’re jus­ti­fied, ex­plains Dr Arthur Ca­plan, the head of bioethics at the New York Univer­sity Lan­gone hos­pi­tal sys­tem, is that risks can be bal­anced against the prospect of bet­ter data. Thus, skip­ping an­i­mal test­ing may pass muster since the data from test­ing hu­mans is bet­ter.</p>
    <p>That leads to the is­sue that di­vides teams at biotech­nol­ogy firm Moderna in Bos­ton and at Ox­ford Univer­sity in Bri­tain, who are work­ing on the two most promis­ing at­tempts to find a vac­cine.</p>
    <p>How much risk of harm­ing hu­mans can they jus­ti­fi­ably take?</p>
    <p>The best way to ac­cel­er­ate the process could fall foul of the long-es­tab­lished obli­ga­tions of med­i­cal ethics, from the Hip­po­cratic Oath to “do no harm”.</p>
    <p>That pledge aligns with the pow­er­ful school of rights-based phi­los­o­phy iden­ti­fied with the 18th-cen­tury Ger­man philoso­pher Im­manuel Kant.</p>
    <p>Vir­tu­ous ends do not jus­tify un­eth­i­cal means, Kan­tians ar­gue.</p>
    <p>In “hu­man chal­lenge tri­als”, which have been used to test cholera and dengue vac­cines, vol­un­teers are in­jected with a vac­cine and then de­lib­er­ately in­fected with the germ that re­searchers are hop­ing to neu­tralise. The sub­jects are tightly mon­i­tored, and re­sults are avail­able within weeks. Re­searchers at</p>
    <p>Ox­ford are de­vel­op­ing strains of the coro­n­avirus in prepa­ra­tion for such a trial, as are the Na­tional In­sti­tutes of Health in the US. Such a study will re­quire 150 vol­un­teers at the most.</p>
    <p>Moderna opted against hu­man chal­lenge tri­als, and in­stead started a con­ven­tional trial with 30,000 test sub­jects last month.</p>
    <p>Vol­un­teers are given ei­ther the vac­cine or a placebo, and then go about their daily lives as the pan­demic rages. Moderna hopes to have sci­en­tif­i­cally re­li­able re­sults by the end of the year.</p>
    <p>Moderna’s chief med­i­cal of­fi­cer Tal Zaks said he ex­pects this ap­proach to re­veal how the vac­cine be­haves with dif­fer­ent groups of peo­ple and in dif­fer­ent re­gions.</p>
    <p>By test­ing in the real world, he said, re­sults can be su­pe­rior to the out­come of chal­lenge tests, which are held in lab­o­ra­tory con­di­tions.</p>
    <p>But the con­ven­tional ap­proach is slower, and leaves much to chance.</p>
    <p>Fur­ther, doc­tors are morally obliged to tell vol­un­teers how to avoid get­ting in­fected.</p>
    <p>They can­not tell them to go mask-less, or to seek out crowded spa­ces, even though from a nar­rowly sci­en­tific point of view this would im­prove their test re­sults.</p>
    <p>Dr Michael Rosen­blatt, a Har­vard Med­i­cal School pro­fes­sor, ob­jects that hu­man chal­lenge stud­ies should be con­tem­plated only when some life-sav­ing treat­ment, such as an anti-vi­ral medicine, is avail­able for a can­di­date who gets sick. There is no such cure for Covid-19.</p>
    <p>Then there is the prob­lem of the un­known. Vac­cines must pass muster with lib­er­tar­i­ans who build moral­ity around in­di­vid­ual free­dom.</p>
    <p>To counter lib­er­tar­ian ob­jec­tions, re­searchers must ob­tain “in­formed con­sent”. Dr Rosen­blatt ar­gues that when it comes to Covid-19, “it’s pretty hard to have in­formed con­sent when we barely know any­thing about this yet”.</p>
    <p>Fi­nally, there is the ap­palling pos­si­bil­ity of a vol­un­teer dy­ing. In 1999, this hap­pened to Jesse Gelsinger, a healthy 18-year-old with a rare meta­bolic ge­netic dis­or­der who vol­un­teered for a con­ven­tional safety trial (not a chal­lenge trial) of a virus-based gene ther­apy. His death was both a per­sonal tragedy and a sci­en­tific dis­as­ter that “set the field of gene ther­apy back by at least two decades”, Dr Rosen­blatt said.</p>
    <p>“That hia­tus de­prived a gen­er­a­tion of pa­tients with ge­netic dis­or­ders of treat­ments.”</p>
    <p>Mr Josh Morrison, who heads ad­vo­cacy group 1 Day Sooner, de­fends the right to vol­un­teer for test­ing. Es­ti­mates at present are that the risk of death from Covid-19 for peo­ple in their 20s with no pre-ex­ist­ing con­di­tions is un­der one in 10,000 – less than the risk of dy­ing in child­birth.</p>
    <p>HOW TO PAY FOR IT?</p>
    <p>Chief man­age­ment of­fi­cer of phar­ma­ceu­ti­cal gi­ant Pfizer John Young said: “A vac­cine is mean­ing­less if peo­ple are un­able to af­ford it.” No­body as­serts that drug com­pa­nies should be able to charge what­ever the mar­ket can bear for a Covid-19 vac­cine. But pri­vate com­pa­nies like Pfizer have a re­spon­si­bil­ity to share­hold­ers.</p>
    <p>More­over, any­one who de­vel­ops a suc­cess­ful coro­n­avirus vac­cine will have per­formed an im­mense ser­vice to hu­man­ity and will de­serve to be re­warded. And so Pfizer de­fends its right to make a profit. Pfizer has a US$2 bil­lion (S$2.75 bil­lion) deal with the US gov­ern­ment to sup­ply as many as 600 mil­lion doses of the vac­cine it is de­vel­op­ing. Many of its com­peti­tors are in col­lab­o­ra­tions with pub­lic uni­ver­si­ties, or re­ceive state fund­ing.</p>
    <p>That raises an in­tensely ide­o­log­i­cal is­sue: Should a pri­vate com­pany be free to set prices for a pub­lic good de­vel­oped with gov­ern­ment aid?</p>
    <p>Moderna chief ex­ec­u­tive Stephane Ban­cel told Ya­hoo Fi­nance: “We have to make a profit out of the first prod­uct.”</p>
    <p>He added: “We have in­vested US$2 bil­lion of our share­holder cap­i­tal since we started the com­pany. We need to get a re­turn.”</p>
    <p>But Moderna has also re­ceived some US$955 mil­lion in gov­ern­ment fund­ing to fi­nance its big test.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to the Fi­nan­cial Times, Moderna is plan­ning to price its</p>
    <p>TEST OF FRENEMIES</p>
    <p>vac­cine at US$25 to US$30 per dose, higher than the US$19.50 at which Pfizer is sell­ing each of its 100 mil­lion doses to the US.</p>
    <p>Bri­tish drug-maker As­traZeneca says it will sell the vac­cine it is de­vel­op­ing with Ox­ford to</p>
    <p>Euro­pean gov­ern­ments at no profit, while John­son & John­son says it will sell its vac­cine at a “not-for-profit price” for emer­gency use.</p>
    <p>The is­sue is al­ready very po­lit­i­cal. Demo­cratic-spon­sored Bills are in Congress to stop price goug­ing.</p>
    <p>Once gov­ern­ments have bought the vac­cine, should they re­quire pa­tients to pay for their own shots?</p>
    <p>Most peo­ple with money would hap­pily pay much more than US$30 to free them­selves from the coro­n­avirus. In the many de­vel­oped coun­tries with na­tion­alised health sys­tems, the ques­tion doesn’t arise: Tax­pay­ers pay, and the vac­cine is free for pa­tients. Th­ese are is­sues de­cided within coun­tries. When it comes to in­ter­na­tional co­op­er­a­tion, poorer coun­tries com­plain about “vac­cine na­tion­al­ism”. Wealthy coun­tries have lit­tle in­cen­tive to col­lab­o­rate with poor ones.</p>
    <p>Costa Rica led an ef­fort with the World Health Or­gan­i­sa­tion to set up a new Covid-19 Tech­nol­ogy Ac­cess Pool that would share re­search and then co­or­di­nate pro­duc­tion – and also share the vac­cine once it was ready. But the list of coun­tries that re­sponded is telling.</p>
    <p>The US, China, Canada and Ja­pan are all ab­sent, while the only Euro­pean coun­tries to sign up have been Bel­gium, Lux­em­bourg, the Nether­lands and Nor­way.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, rich coun­tries are prospec­tively buy­ing up vac­cines be­fore they have even been cleared for use. For now, at­tempts at “vac­cine jus­tice” have been left to phi­lan­thropies such as the Gates Foun­da­tion’s Vac­cine Net­work.</p>
    <p>HOW TO RATION IT?</p>
    <p>The phar­ma­ceu­ti­cal in­dus­try can­not pro­duce enough vac­cine for the en­tire global pop­u­la­tion of al­most eight bil­lion all at once. There­fore, ra­tioning is in­evitable. Who gets to make th­ese de­ci­sions, and by what cri­te­ria?</p>
    <p>Within the US, var­i­ous med­i­cal bod­ies and gov­ern­ment agen­cies claim author­ity to draw up the guide­lines. No one seems em­pow­ered to ad­ju­di­cate. Dr Ca­plan says: “The prin­ci­ple is to pro­tect those most likely to be harmed.”</p>
    <p>That leads to one point of clar­ity: Med­i­cal work­ers go first. They’re ob­vi­ously at risk, and have a duty to put them­selves in harm’s way.</p>
    <p>But af­ter this, fol­low­ing his cri­te­rion leads to pri­ori­tis­ing some of the least priv­i­leged in so­ci­ety.</p>
    <p>Sta­tis­ti­cally, pris­on­ers fol­low doc­tors and nurses on the list of peo­ple most likely to be harmed.</p>
    <p>Within the US, Na­tive Amer­i­can com­mu­ni­ties are griev­ously af­fected, and there­fore have a case for pri­or­ity. The same is true of some other eth­nic mi­nori­ties.</p>
    <p>Peo­ple are also more at risk if they can­not work from home.</p>
    <p>Univer­sity of Western On­tario phi­los­o­phy pro­fes­sor An­thony Skel­ton makes a case for send­ing those in work-at-home pro­fes­sions to the back of the line.</p>
    <p>All of th­ese pro­pos­als spring from pri­ori­tis­ing peo­ple ac­cord­ing to risk, but might in prac­tice look like the kind of re­dis­tri­bu­tion­ist so­cial jus­tice cru­sad­ing that pro­vokes con­tro­versy, par­tic­u­larly in the US.</p>
    <p>Ra­tioning could also be af­fected by where the vac­cine was tested. In the case of Aids (ac­quired im­mune de­fi­ciency syn­drome), ex­per­i­men­tal treat­ments were as­sessed in Africa, where test­ing was cheaper, but the treat­ments then went to de­vel­oped coun­tries.</p>
    <p>Se­verely af­fected African coun­tries had to pay pro­hib­i­tive prices.</p>
    <p>Africa could be­come a Covid-19 test site if reg­u­la­tors do not per­mit hu­man chal­lenge tests else­where.</p>
    <p>If large-scale test­ing does hap­pen there, jus­tice will de­mand that early sup­plies of the vac­cine are made avail­able to Africans, even at the ex­pense of peo­ple in the re­searchers’ home coun­tries.</p>
    <p>HOW TO ROLL IT OUT?</p>
    <p>Vac­ci­na­tions work best when ev­ery­one re­ceives them, since germs that can’t in­fect peo­ple tend to wither away. But all vac­cines come with risks. That cre­ates a free-rider prob­lem.</p>
    <p>The best op­tion from a self-in­ter­ested point of view is that ev­ery­body else has the shot (elim­i­nat­ing your per­sonal risk of catch­ing Covid-19) – but that you don’t (avoid­ing any per­sonal risk of side ef­fects). The pub­lic health case for com­pul­sion is strong.</p>
    <p>But lib­er­tar­i­ans have a prob­lem with forc­ing a po­ten­tially harm­ful vac­cine on some­one with­out the “in­formed con­sent” that’s hard to pro­cure in so­ci­eties scep­ti­cal of ex­perts and low on so­cial trust.</p>
    <p>How can the vac­cine reach a crit­i­cal mass with­out com­pul­sion?</p>
    <p>Dr Ca­plan sug­gests leav­ing com­pul­sion to pri­vate en­ti­ties. An em­ployer might de­mand vac­ci­na­tion as a con­di­tion of re­port­ing for work. A vac­cine might be dan­gled as a golden ticket to re­turn to the­atres, cine­mas, night clubs or sports events. Gov­ern­ments or foun­da­tions could even pay peo­ple to re­ceive a shot.</p>
    <p>By this think­ing, those who assert their right not to be vac­ci­nated would be free to work from home and home-school. They would be vol­un­tar­ily nar­row­ing their own free­dom of move­ment and assem­bly. Yet so­ci­eties would pay a price. The virus has di­vided hu­mans in count­less ways al­ready. If many cit­i­zens opt to stay un­vac­ci­nated, the virus and the messy ethics of com­pelling vac­ci­na­tion will have helped to cre­ate an­other per­ma­nent di­vi­sion.</p>
