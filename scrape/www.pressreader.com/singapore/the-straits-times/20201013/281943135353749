    <p>With the cold sea­son ap­proach­ing in the north­ern hemi­sphere, it is be­com­ing in­creas­ingly – and wor­ry­ingly – clear that a win­ter of dis­ease, and dis­con­tent, looms. Re­ports show the dis­mal level of Covid-19 cases in the United States. Some hos­pi­tals are ap­par­ently run­ning short of med­i­cal sup­plies even as de­mand for test­ing rises, partly be­cause even com­mon flu symp­toms are making peo­ple ner­vous. Europe is fully into a sec­ond wave, and In­dia is the sec­ond coun­try where in­fec­tions have now topped seven mil­lion cases. Bri­tish cases are dou­bling ev­ery week. Coun­tries like Ger­many that ap­peared to han­dle the ini­tial out­break ef­fec­tively have now been forced to take coun­ter­mea­sures to tackle the dis­ease.</p>
    <p>Not sur­pris­ingly, some of the worst af­fected coun­tries are those where po­lit­i­cal lead­ers were dis­mis­sive of sci­ence, no­tably the US and Brazil, the lat­ter where Pres­i­dent Jair Bol­sonaro ini­tially likened Covid-19 to the flu and said it should be faced “like a man, not a boy”. Brazil’s Covid-19 count has topped five mil­lion, with some 150,000 deaths. The man he ad­mires, US Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump, has like­wise adopted a dis­mis­sive at­ti­tude that has spread among many Amer­i­cans. Both lead­ers were in­fected. Mr Trump has just re­turned to the White House af­ter treat­ment at a mil­i­tary fa­cil­ity not ac­ces­si­ble to most Amer­i­cans.</p>
    <p>Much of their ap­proach and out­look is re­lated to pol­i­tics, no doubt. Whether it is Mr Trump, fac­ing an election in three weeks, or his ally, Bri­tish Prime Min­is­ter Boris John­son, who is play­ing tough on a Brexit trade deal with the Euro­pean Union, their self-im­age, pub­lic pos­ture and pol­i­tics sug­gest that their ad­min­is­tra­tions are not ac­tively de­vel­op­ing ro­bust fire­walls and de­fence sys­tems against this run­away dis­ease. The costs of ig­nor­ing sci­ence, and sim­ple com­mon sense, are dis­tress­ing. US stud­ies show that while males suf­fer dis­pro­por­tion­ately in terms of Covid-19 mor­bid­ity, the eco­nomic fall­out hits women harder, es­pe­cially in lost liveli­hoods and earn­ings. Bri­tain’s econ­omy shrank by a fifth in the sec­ond quar­ter.</p>
    <p>Mr John­son has is­sued a plea for those who can work from home to do so un­til the virus is un­der con­trol – just weeks af­ter en­cour­ag­ing a re­turn to the of­fice and work­places. Mr Trump’s White House is now a dis­ease epi­cen­tre with many aides ill. All this comes with geopo­lit­i­cal con­se­quences for debt and growth – when it need not have been the case. Heed­ing sci­ence and epi­demi­o­log­i­cal ex­perts and com­mit­ting to share in­ter­na­tional data and find­ings can still be in­stru­men­tal to chart­ing a path to open­ing up. What has hap­pened in many Covid-19-hit na­tions is an ap­proach dic­tated by po­lit­i­cal pres­sure, in­ter­est groups and pop­ulism. This has not only en­dan­gered the wider so­ci­ety but also weak­ened busi­nesses and set back the po­ten­tial for re­cov­ery when coun­tries could have been tak­ing small but sig­nif­i­cant steps for­ward.</p>
