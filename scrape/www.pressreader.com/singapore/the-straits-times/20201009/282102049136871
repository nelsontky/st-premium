    <p>Keep­ing a dog or any other pet is a huge com­mit­ment.</p>
    <p>Be­sides tak­ing care of the an­i­mal’s gen­eral wel­fare, the owner must also be re­spon­si­ble for train­ing it.</p>
    <p>In the case of dogs, it is only rea­son­able that own­ers must clean up af­ter them – for in­stance, pick up their poo when out­side.</p>
    <p>Dog own­ers have been leav­ing be­hind a trail of dog poo on the street where I live. I have in­stalled a closed-cir­cuit tele­vi­sion cam­era and put up my own sign ask­ing dog own­ers to pick up af­ter their dogs, but to no avail. One dog owner even turned ag­gres­sive when I re­minded him of his re­spon­si­bil­ity.</p>
    <p>I have writ­ten to the Na­tional En­vi­ron­ment Agency (NEA) to find out if I can sub­mit ev­i­dence of dog own­ers not pick­ing up af­ter their pets. Al­though the NEA replied af­fir­ma­tively and said it could be done via e-mail, I think it is im­prac­ti­cal.</p>
    <p>I sug­gest that the NEA de­velop an on­line por­tal for com­plainants to up­load such ev­i­dence.</p>
    <p>It should do more to ed­u­cate dog own­ers to ob­serve the rules and eti­quette. Many dog own­ers do not seem to be aware that there is a $1,000 fine for not pick­ing up af­ter their dogs. That mes­sage needs to be made clear.</p>
    <p>I sug­gest that the NEA put up signs and de­ploy plain-clothes in­spec­tors to book of­fend­ers in ar­eas where such of­fences oc­cur. It is time that the agency got tough with re­cal­ci­trant of­fend­ers be­fore the sit­u­a­tion gets out of con­trol.</p>
