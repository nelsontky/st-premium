    <p>Ex­perts have come up with a Covid-19 re­port card that can as­sess a coun­try’s per­for­mance in re­sponse to the pan­demic, and could sig­nal if na­tions are ready to ease lock­downs and al­low for in­ter­na­tional travel.</p>
    <p>The com­men­tary, pub­lished yes­ter­day in top med­i­cal jour­nal The Lancet, out­lined seven in­di­ca­tors to as­sess na­tional per­for­mance, rang­ing from abil­ity to de­tect and break trans­mis­sion chains, to main­tain­ing food and medicine sup­ply chains, and pro­tect­ing the vul­ner­a­ble.</p>
    <p>“The seven in­di­ca­tors are not just about the po­ten­tial im­pact to hu­man health, they di­rectly trans­late to the abil­ity to pre­serve lives and liveli­hoods, to min­imise all-round im­pact to hu­man lives, in an eq­ui­table man­ner,” said Pro­fes­sor Teo Yik Ying, dean of the Na­tional Univer­sity of Sin­ga­pore’s Saw Swee Hock School of Pub­lic Health, and one of the au­thors of the pa­per.</p>
    <p>The oth­ers were Pro­fes­sor Dale Fisher, se­nior con­sul­tant in the in­fec­tious diseases divi­sion at the Na­tional Univer­sity Hospi­tal and chair of the World Health Or­ga­n­i­tion’s Global Out­break Alert and Re­sponse Net­work steer­ing com­mit­tee, and Dr David Nabarro, spe­cial en­voy of the WHO for the Covid-19 re­sponse.</p>
    <p>The pa­per noted that though some coun­tries – among them the United States and Bri­tain – had ranked highly un­der ex­ist­ing as­sess­ments such as the Global Health Se­cu­rity In­dex (GHSI), an an­nual as­sess­ment of how ready coun­tries are to deal with in­fec­tious dis­ease out­breaks, this did not re­flect their ac­tual pan­demic pre­pared­ness.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, coun­tries like Viet­nam and New Zealand, ranked 50th and 35th, re­spec­tively, on the in­dex, did well in the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>“The GHSI re­gret­tably re­lied only on open source data for their ap­praisal, but there are some coun­tries that do not pub­li­cise their pan­demic pre­pared­ness plans openly,”</p>
    <p>Prof Teo told The Straits Times.</p>
    <p>The seven in­di­ca­tors serve as check­points be­yond daily case num­bers, which are of­ten used to judge a coun­try’s han­dling of Covid-19, but are in fact un­re­li­able in as­sess­ing its re­sponse, the au­thors noted.</p>
    <p>Case num­bers may not re­flect the true sit­u­a­tion as they are de­pen­dent on a coun­try’s test­ing strat­egy and ca­pac­ity, and the ex­tent to which in­di­vid­u­als go for test­ing. It also ne­glects how ef­fec­tively clus­ters have been con­tained and virus trans­mis­sion sup­pressed.</p>
    <p>Aus­tralia, for one, saw new daily coro­n­avirus cases fall to sin­gle dig­its at the end of May but is now wit­ness­ing over 200 new cases a day. Its sec­ond most pop­u­lous state, Vic­to­ria, re­ported an­other 238 cases over 24 hours on Wed­nes­day.</p>
    <p>Prof Fisher said: “What it shows is that Vic­to­ria is not ready to un­lock or open bor­ders; they opened be­cause they had few cases but we can see now that that mea­sure of daily new cases was ir­rel­e­vant. This could also well ap­ply to other ar­eas that achieved low num­bers through lock­downs and bor­der clo­sures.”</p>
    <p>Gen­er­ally, places that have done well in­clude Viet­nam, Tai­wan, Hong Kong, New Zealand and</p>
    <p>South Korea, Prof Teo said.</p>
    <p>“Sin­ga­pore, in my opin­ion, has also done well for al­most all the in­di­ca­tors, and even though we were un­able to avoid the out­break af­fect­ing mi­grant work­ers in the coun­try, it is the re­me­dial ac­tions that mat­ter.</p>
    <p>“Sin­ga­pore con­tin­ues to pro­vide fi­nan­cial safety nets to all mi­grant work­ers through pro­vi­sion of com­plete med­i­cal cov­er­age for Covid-19 in­fec­tion and salary sup­port,” said Prof Teo.</p>
    <p>But, Prof Fisher said, it is not pos­si­ble for the ex­perts to as­sess all coun­tries as in­for­ma­tion needed is gen­er­ally not read­ily avail­able.</p>
    <p>“Only gov­ern­ments can self-as­sess or use the tool to show their strength,” he said.</p>
