    <p>DPM Heng Swee Keat thanks re­tired MPs</p>
    <p>Deputy Prime Min­is­ter Heng Swee Keat carved out time from a widerang­ing speech to pay trib­ute to MPs who have re­tired, in­clud­ing for­mer prime min­is­ter Goh Chok Tong and for­mer WP chief Low Thia Khi­ang.</p>
    <p>Mr Heng re­called that Mr Goh’s ad­vice to him, dur­ing the global fi­nan­cial cri­sis of 2008-2009, left a last­ing im­pres­sion on him, and it con­tin­ues to guide his work dur­ing the pan­demic. He was then man­ag­ing di­rec­tor of the Mon­e­tary Au­thor­ity of Sin­ga­pore (MAS), while Mr Goh was then its chair­man.</p>
    <p>Banks around the world were in trou­ble, and MAS had to make a mo­men­tous de­ci­sion on whether to seek the Pres­i­dent’s ap­proval for a $150 bil­lion guar­an­tee on all bank de­posits backed up by Sin­ga­pore’s past re­serves, Mr Heng said.</p>
    <p>“I was glad to have his wise coun­sel. Mr Goh taught us that we must face dif­fi­cult de­ci­sions head-on. It was a les­son that stayed with me,” added DPM Heng, who thanked his for­mer bosses at the Min­istry of Trade and In­dus­try (MTI) as well, namely for­mer MTI min­is­ter Lim Hng Kiang and for­mer trans­port min­is­ter Khaw Boon Wan, who was MTI’s per­ma­nent sec­re­tary when DPM Heng was with the min­istry.</p>
    <p>He also gave a spe­cial men­tion to Mr Low, who had been an op­po­si­tion MP from 1991 un­til this year, when he re­tired from pol­i­tics.</p>
    <p>“He’s a fiery speaker at elec­tion ral­lies, but when it comes to the crunch, when our na­tional in­ter­est is at stake, he stands to­gether with the Govern­ment,” said the DPM, adding that Mr Low has deep con­vic­tions about lan­guage, cul­ture and her­itage, and the long-term suc­cess of Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>“When I last spoke to him, he told me he was very happy play­ing with his grand­child. I am glad he has re­cov­ered from his fall and wish him good health.”</p>
