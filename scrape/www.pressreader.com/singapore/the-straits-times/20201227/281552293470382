    <p>There were 10 new coro­n­avirus cases con­firmed yesterday, in­clud­ing a Le­banese na­tional found to be in­fected with Covid-19 af­ter he had com­pleted part of his stay-home no­tice (SHN) at the Mandarin Or­chard Sin­ga­pore ho­tel.</p>
    <p>The Min­istry of Health (MOH) said last night that he was trans­ferred to an­other ded­i­cated fa­cil­ity last Sunday, when the min­istry be­gan in­ves­ti­ga­tions into 13 Covid-19 cases who had served their SHN at the ho­tel.</p>
    <p>The 13 cases, which came from 10 dif­fer­ent coun­tries, were in­fected by coro­n­avirus strains with “high ge­netic sim­i­lar­ity”, which im­plied that the in­fec­tions might have come from one source and could have hap­pened in the ho­tel.</p>
    <p>The 37-year-old Le­banese man likely picked up Covid-19 af­ter ar­rival in Sin­ga­pore from Qatar, ac­cord­ing to facts laid out by MOH.</p>
    <p>The short-term visit pass holder was swabbed for Covid-19 on Dec 19 and 21 and his test re­sults were negative. His swab on Dec 24, at the end of his SHN, came back pos­i­tive, while his sero­log­i­cal test re­sult was negative. The lat­ter test de­ter­mines if his in­fec­tion was an old one.</p>
    <p>“In­ves­ti­ga­tions are on­go­ing to as­sess if he could be linked to the 13 cases,” said MOH.</p>
    <p>All 10 cases an­nounced by MOH yesterday were im­ported.</p>
    <p>The new cases, of which none is from the com­mu­nity or work­ers’ dor­mi­to­ries, take Sin­ga­pore’s to­tal to 58,519.</p>
    <p>All of them had been placed on SHN or iso­lated upon ar­rival in Sin­ga­pore. They were all asymp­to­matic.</p>
    <p>Two of the new cases are Sin­ga­pore­ans who had re­turned from Britain.</p>
    <p>Five are In­dian na­tion­als who had ar­rived from their home coun­try. The re­main­ing two cases are a Bangladesh­i and a Malaysian, who had ar­rived from Bangladesh and In­done­sia re­spec­tively.</p>
    <p>MOH said the Malaysian is a care­giver to an in­di­vid­ual who was al­ready re­ceiv­ing med­i­cal care in Sin­ga­pore and had re­turned for fur­ther treat­ment.</p>
    <p>It added that epi­demi­o­log­i­cal in­ves­ti­ga­tions are on­go­ing. In the mean­time, close con­tacts of the cases have been iso­lated, placed on quar­an­tine, and will be tested at the start and end of their quar­an­tine pe­riod.</p>
    <p>MOH will also con­duct sero­log­i­cal tests for the close con­tacts to de­ter­mine if the cases could have been in­fected by them.</p>
