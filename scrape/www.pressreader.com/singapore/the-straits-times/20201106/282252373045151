    <p>Nin­tendo’s net profit more than tripled for the first half of this fis­cal year, the gam­ing gi­ant said in its earn­ings re­port yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Sony’s net profit over the same pe­riod has dou­bled, while a Ja­panese an­ime film is shat­ter­ing do­mes­tic box-of­fice records.</p>
    <p>Toy­ota, which re­ports earn­ings today, also has rea­sons to be bullish. Its monthly global pro­duc­tion for Septem­ber hit a new high.</p>
    <p>The gam­ing in­dus­try has been one of the clear ben­e­fi­cia­ries of the Covid-19 pan­demic, given citywide shut­downs and stay-at-home or­ders (or, in Ja­pan, ad­vi­sories).</p>
    <p>The in­dus­try will likely re­main re­silient even as Ja­pan opens for busi­ness by re­mov­ing vir­tu­ally all Covid-19 curbs, trig­ger­ing a surge in de­mand for con­sump­tion.</p>
    <p>Ja­pan’s econ­omy is ex­pected to grow an an­nu­alised 18.4 per cent in the July to Septem­ber quar­ter, the Jiji News Agency re­ported, cit­ing think-tank es­ti­mates ahead of the re­lease of gross do­mes­tic prod­uct data on Nov 16.</p>
    <p>This comes af­ter the econ­omy shrank 28.1 per cent in the April to June quar­ter, in what was the worst post-war con­trac­tion.</p>
    <p>The gov­ern­ment is also bullish, up­grad­ing its monthly con­sump­tion out­look last month and not­ing stronger de­mand for elec­tron­ics and higher travel spend­ing.</p>
    <p>Ja­pan is now stak­ing its eco­nomic re­cov­ery on the hard­est-hit sec­tors like avi­a­tion and tourism, by pro­mot­ing do­mes­tic travel and con­sump­tion via the Go To Travel and Go To Eat cam­paigns.</p>
    <p>But will this be a flash in the pan? The daily Covid-19 tally ex­ceeded the 1,000-case thresh­old yes­ter­day for the first time since Aug 21, with at least 1,045 new cases.</p>
    <p>This was led by Tokyo, with 269 new in­fec­tions. The city’s mov­ing seven-day av­er­age now stands at 175 cases a day.</p>
    <p>Kana­gawa, part of the Greater</p>
    <p>Tokyo re­gion, re­ported 109 new cases, cross­ing the 100-case mark for the first time in 50 days.</p>
    <p>And more star­tlingly, Hokkaido recorded 119 in­fec­tions yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>This was the first time Ja­pan’s north­ern­most pre­fec­ture – which saw its first snow­fall of the sea­son this week – has ever tal­lied more than 100 cases in a sin­gle day.</p>
    <p>The Ja­panese gov­ern­ment recog­nises the risks that wide­spread travel might pose, and has pro­posed mea­sures like ex­tend­ing the New Year hol­i­day by a full week un­til Jan 11 so that peo­ple can stag­ger the tim­ing of their re­turn to their home­towns.</p>
    <p>But it is also not ready to give up the eco­nomic wind­fall that sub­sidy cam­paigns like Go To will bring. The cam­paigns, blasted as be­ing ve­hi­cles for the spread of Covid-19, have been de­fended as a nec­es­sary evil.</p>
    <p>Prime Min­is­ter Yoshi­hide Suga has, time and again, noted that while mil­lions have lever­aged the cam­paigns since the launch in July, only dozens have been in­fected.</p>
    <p>The gov­ern­ment is now mulling over an ex­ten­sion of the sub­si­dies – which slash travel costs by up to 50 per cent – un­til the end of the Golden Week hol­i­day in May.</p>
    <p>And as win­ter il­lu­mi­na­tions be­gin to light up across Ja­pan, there is lit­tle ev­i­dence that an uptick in cases will do any­thing to dampen the ap­petite of a pop­u­la­tion with rel­a­tively high dis­pos­able in­come.</p>
    <p>Movie­go­ers are sit­ting shoul­der to shoul­der in cin­e­mas na­tion­wide, the in­dus­try buoyed by the re­lease of mon­ster hit De­mon Slayer: In­fin­ity Train (Kimetsu no Yaiba: Mu­gen Ressha in Ja­panese) on Oct 16.</p>
    <p>The tale, of an ado­les­cent boy who fights hu­man-eat­ing demons set about 100 years ago, shat­tered do­mes­tic box-of­fice records by rak­ing in 10.7 bil­lion yen (S$139.4 mil­lion) in just 10 days.</p>
    <p>This eas­ily bested the pre­vi­ous record-holder Spir­ited Away, the Hayao Miyazaki an­ime that took 25 days to cross the 10 bil­lion yen bench­mark.</p>
    <p>This is a big boost for Sony, whose an­ime and mu­sic unit Ani­plex co-pro­duced De­mon Slayer: In­fin­ity Train. Ms Naoki Mat­suoka, of Sony’s fi­nance and in­vestor re­la­tions, told an earn­ings call last month: “We ex­pect an­ime stream­ing rev­enue and the suc­cess of the movie to con­trib­ute to our busi­ness this year.”</p>
    <p>Mer­chan­dis­ing is a multi-bil­lion-dol­lar busi­ness in Ja­pan, and other com­pa­nies are also set to cash in.</p>
    <p>These in­clude con­ve­nience store chain Law­son, which has re­leased a wide ar­ray of an­ime-re­lated goods, and Kyushu Rail­way, which is op­er­at­ing a steam lo­co­mo­tive sim­i­lar to the one in the film.</p>
    <p>Sony will also likely ben­e­fit from the re­lease of its new PlayS­ta­tion 5 game con­sole next Thurs­day, in time for the hol­i­day sea­son. It ex­pects to sell more than 7.6 mil­lion units by the end of the fis­cal year next March.</p>
    <p>Its com­peti­tor Nin­tendo, known for the Su­per Mario se­ries and, more re­cently, the smash hit An­i­mal Cross­ing: New Hori­zons, also re­ported stel­lar earn­ings yes­ter­day. Its half-year net profit soared 243.6 per cent to 213 bil­lion yen, while the firm will boost out­put of its Switch game con­sole by 20 per cent.</p>
    <p>The re­cov­ery of Ja­pan’s econ­omy will likely hinge on these re­silient sec­tors – and a hope that pub­lic re­spon­si­bil­ity and so­cial eti­quette will be enough to put a lid on the Covid-19 spread with­out ag­gres­sive gov­ern­ment in­ter­ven­tion.</p>
    <p>The gam­ing in­dus­try has been one of the clear ben­e­fi­cia­ries of the Covid-19 pan­demic, given citywide shut­downs and stay-at-home or­ders (or, in Ja­pan, ad­vi­sories).</p>
    <p>The in­dus­try will likely re­main re­silient even as Ja­pan opens for busi­ness by re­mov­ing vir­tu­ally all Covid-19 curbs, trig­ger­ing a surge in de­mand for con­sump­tion.</p>
