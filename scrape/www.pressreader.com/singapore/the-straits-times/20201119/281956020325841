    <p>Ia­gree with Dr Yik Keng Yeong that the birth rate in Sin­ga­pore is a mat­ter of con­cern (Even more needs to be done to en­cour­age hav­ing ba­bies, Nov 11). The good news is that some fam­i­lies are more will­ing to have three or four chil­dren; I know of sev­eral among my friends. But those who pre­fer only two, one or even none are still the ma­jor­ity.</p>
    <p>The Gov­ern­ment has pro­vided a lot of fi­nan­cial help to cou­ples to en­cour­age them to have more ba­bies. This is good.</p>
    <p>But as a mother of two boys, I have found that while money is im­por­tant, the most headache-in­duc­ing part of bring­ing up a child lies else­where, es­pe­cially in to­day’s so­ci­ety where both par­ents tend to be work­ing.</p>
    <p>Ask any work­ing par­ent who has a child be­low 10 years old what their big­gest headache is. It is when the child is ill, es­pe­cially after of­fice hours. Worse still is when one child after an­other is ill.</p>
    <p>A trip to KK Women’s and Chil­dren’s Hos­pi­tal (KKH), whether day or night, is usu­ally a four-to-six-hour af­fair. Wait­ing for a long time with a hot and cry­ing baby in one’s arm is not a good feel­ing. One feels lost, scared and frus­trated, while the doc­tors and nurses are so near yet seem so far.</p>
    <p>Then the next day, one par­ent has to stay home with the child – if there is no one else to help – as child­care cen­tres can­not take in an ill child. A par­ent has his work dis­rupted, feels tired and – in the case of a new par­ent – maybe is un­sure of what to do.</p>
    <p>The one area in which the Gov­ern­ment could re­ally pro­vide some help is in chil­dren’s health­care.</p>
    <p>Make a pae­di­a­tri­cian avail­able in poly­clin­ics. Pro­vide bet­ter in­for­ma­tion on where to find a pae­di­a­tri­cian after of­fice hours. And en­sure shorter wait­ing times at KKH.</p>
    <p>A way to help when a child falls ill is to give par­ents con­fi­dence that the child is in good hands and let them have a break.</p>
    <p>This can be in the form of a fa­cil­ity, run by pro­fes­sion­als, where sick chil­dren can be dropped off so par­ents have peace of mind, or a cor­ner in the child­care cen­tre to help take care of the ill child, or a way to engage a qual­i­fied per­son at short no­tice to look after the sick child at home.</p>
    <p>This will make a world of dif­fer­ence to young fam­i­lies who need it – when you know that when your child is ill, there is help. It’s time we care for the chil­dren and not just the sta­tis­tics.</p>
