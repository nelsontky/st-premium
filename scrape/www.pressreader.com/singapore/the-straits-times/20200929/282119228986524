    <p>I dis­agree with the con­cerns Mr Phillip Tan Fong Lip raised over do­mes­tic helpers and part-time em­ploy­ment (Al­low­ing maids to work part-time a kind but un­wise move, Sept 26).</p>
    <p>Mr Tan should note that, in the sta­tus quo, maids al­ready have the op­tion of do­ing ad­di­tional work for their em­ployer dur­ing of­fi­cial days off. There is an in­con­gru­ence in per­mit­ting such ar­range­ments while pro­hibit­ing ex­ter­nal en­gage­ments.</p>
    <p>More­over, pre­sent­ing the op­tion of part-time em­ploy­ment does not take away the op­tion of a rest day for maids who would rather un­wind.</p>
    <p>I be­lieve that each maid is best qual­i­fied to judge her own ca­pac­ity for work and need for rest. I see no is­sue with giv­ing maids this op­tion to choose what they pre­fer.</p>
    <p>Sec­ond, on em­ployer al­tru­ism,</p>
    <p>Mr Tan makes sweep­ing gen­er­al­i­sa­tions about the maid-em­ployer re­la­tion­ship.</p>
    <p>I em­ploy a maid. If I knew that their ser­vices were not re­quired around the clock, why would I ob­ject to their pur­su­ing other ben­e­fi­cial en­deav­ours dur­ing their “down­time”? Who am I to place ar­bi­trary lim­its?</p>
    <p>Third, on the is­sue of li­a­bil­ity, one imag­ines that part-time work is not so haz­ardous as to make this a de­ci­sive ar­gu­ment.</p>
    <p>Even if a mishap were to oc­cur, the stan­dard logic of li­a­bil­ity – the lo­ca­tion, time in re­la­tion to clocked hours, and the em­ployer who as­signed the duty lead­ing to in­jury – would surely ap­ply.</p>
    <p>In the larger scheme of things, there is no good rea­son for our in­clu­sive so­ci­ety to deny maids mean­ing­ful op­por­tu­ni­ties.</p>
    <p>Paul Chan Poh Hoi</p>
