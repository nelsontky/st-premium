    <p>The pub­lic and pri­vate sec­tors must work to­gether for reg­u­la­tions on new tech­nolo­gies to work, said pan­el­lists on the sec­ond day of the Fu­tureChina Global Fo­rum yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The five-mem­ber panel made up of lead­ers in gov­ern­ment and high­level com­pany rep­re­sen­ta­tives came to this con­clu­sion after a de­bate on whether dig­i­tal in­fra­struc­ture or reg­u­la­tions are more im­por­tant for new tech­nolo­gies to suc­ceed and ben­e­fit so­ci­ety.</p>
    <p>These two fac­tors came up tops in a poll con­ducted of view­ers at the fo­rum held on­line; they voted for dig­i­tal in­fra­struc­ture, while reg­u­la­tions came in at sec­ond. The other op­tions – re­search and devel­op­ment and more spe­cialised man­power – rounded up the poll’s results.</p>
    <p>Pan­el­list Chia Song Hwee, deputy chief ex­ec­u­tive of Te­masek In­ter­na­tional, said that reg­u­la­tions should be the most crit­i­cal fac­tor for new tech­nolo­gies to de­velop, when the mod­er­a­tor asked if the panel dis­agreed with the poll results.</p>
    <p>Mr Chia said reg­u­la­tion and pol­icy are the “most dif­fi­cult prob­lems to solve” for the po­ten­tial of the dig­i­tal econ­omy to be fully re­alised.</p>
    <p>Reg­u­la­tors have to con­sider how they want to de­velop the com­pe­ti­tion, as well as take into ac­count how the new tech­nol­ogy will af­fect so­ci­ety, he added.</p>
    <p>With­out the ap­pro­pri­ate mind­set, there is the ten­dency to over­reg­u­late, which sti­fles in­no­va­tion, he added.</p>
    <p>“If you leave it to the com­mer­cial world, we will in­no­vate. We will find money, we will do things, but then we can go over­board,” he added. “Find­ing the right bal­ance be­tween reg­u­la­tion and hav­ing the en­vi­ron­ment where peo­ple can in­no­vate and busi­ness ideas can come to re­al­i­sa­tion is the im­por­tant (fac­tor),” he said.</p>
    <p>An­other pan­el­list, In­fo­comm Me­dia Devel­op­ment Author­ity (IMDA) chief ex­ec­u­tive Lew Chuen Hong, said that “in­deed, an en­light­ened pol­icy and reg­u­la­tion are crit­i­cal, but... the idea that it can be en­light­ened reg­u­la­tion (is) not an oxy­moron”.</p>
    <p>“We think of reg­u­la­tion al­most as if it is an ex­ter­nally im­posed heavy hand, but... if you go by the idea of a guid­ing hand, a lot can be done as far as stan­dards (and) pro­vid­ing cer­tainty,” he added.</p>
    <p>IMDA be­lieves “in work­ing with the mar­ket, not against the mar­ket”, Mr Lew said.</p>
    <p>Other mem­bers of the panel, ti­tled Em­brac­ing The Next Fron­tier Of Tech­no­log­i­cal Growth Towards</p>
    <p>New Eco­nomic Fu­ture, were Se­nior Min­is­ter of State for Health Koh Poh Koon; Mr Li Tiantian, founder and chair­man of DXY.cn, a web­site that pro­vides aca­demic in­for­ma­tion to doc­tors; and Mr Wei Feng, found­ing part­ner at fund man­age­ment firm COCOCap­i­tal.</p>
    <p>The ses­sion was mod­er­ated by Mr Dulee­sha Ku­la­sooriya, ex­ec­u­tive di­rec­tor of Deloitte Cen­tre for the Edge, Asia-Pa­cific.</p>
    <p>Before the panel dis­cus­sion, Dr Koh said in a speech that the changes brought about by</p>
    <p>Covid-19, such as so­cial dis­tanc­ing mea­sures, have em­pha­sised the im­por­tance of seiz­ing op­por­tu­ni­ties in the grow­ing dig­i­tal econ­omy.</p>
    <p>He also urged com­pa­nies to tap op­por­tu­ni­ties in Asean trade, as busi­nesses are look­ing to di­ver­sify their sup­ply chains.</p>
    <p>Dr Koh said that trade flows be­tween China and Asean had been grow­ing in re­cent years. Vol­umes in the first six months of the year grew 2.2 per cent, plac­ing Asean as China’s largest trad­ing part­ner and vice versa, he added, cit­ing sta­tis­tics from China.</p>
    <p>“It’s timely for both sides to see how we can fur­ther en­hance the ACFTA (Asean-China Free Trade Agree­ment) to en­sure it re­mains ‘fit for pur­pose’ in a post-pan­demic world,” he said.</p>
