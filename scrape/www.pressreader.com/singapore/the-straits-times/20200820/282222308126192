    <p>Banque de Com­merce et de Place­ments, Dubai In­ter­na­tional Fi­nan­cial Cen­tre branch, has sued China Avi­a­tion Oil (Sin­ga­pore) Corp over an al­leged fraud­u­lent deal as the Swiss bank seeks to re­claim US$19 mil­lion (S$25.9 mil­lion) it paid to the Sin­ga­porelisted com­pany for a cargo, a court doc­u­ment showed.</p>
    <p>In a writ of sum­mons filed at the Sin­ga­pore High Court, the bank said it is­sued a let­ter of credit in Jan­uary on be­half of ZenRock Com­modi­ties Trad­ing to fi­nance its pur­chase of about 260,000 bar­rels of gasoil from China Avi­a­tion Oil (CAO).</p>
    <p>CAO is the largest jet fuel trader in Asia and is ma­jor­ity owned by a Chi­nese state-owned com­pany.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore-based ZenRock had in­tended to sell the cargo to PetroChina In­ter­na­tional (East China) Co, the bank said.</p>
    <p>CAO and KPMG, ZenRock’s in­terim ju­di­cial man­ager, de­clined to com­ment.</p>
    <p>The bank and its lawyer did not re­spond to emailed re­quests for com­ment.</p>
    <p>ZenRock was placed un­der in­terim ju­di­cial man­age­ment in May after one of its cred­i­tors, HSBC Hold­ings, al­leged that it en­gaged in a se­ries of “highly dis­hon­est trans­ac­tions”.</p>
    <p>Banque de Com­merce paid CAO about US$19 mil­lion in March after the seller pre­sented doc­u­ments to show that the cargo had been loaded onto a tanker in Me­laka, Malaysia, and that ZenRock had taken de­liv­ery, ac­cord­ing to the court doc­u­ment.</p>
    <p>The Swiss bank said that CAO’s “rep­re­sen­ta­tions were in fact false in that, no cargo was shipped and/or de­liv­ered pur­suant to the CAO-(ZenRock) con­tract”.</p>
    <p>By pre­sent­ing the doc­u­ments, CAO “had acted in breach of the let­ter of credit”, it added.</p>
    <p>It has claimed dam­ages and in­ter­est on top of the amount it paid for the cargo, ac­cord­ing to the doc­u­ment.</p>
    <p>A hear­ing for the case is sched­uled for Sept 2.</p>
    <p>Last week, Lim Oon Kuin, founder of an­other trou­bled Sin­ga­pore oil trader, Hin Leong Trad­ing, was charged in court with abet­ment of forgery for the pur­pose of cheat­ing.</p>
    <p>Hin Leong, one of Asia’s largest oil traders, was placed un­der ju­di­cial man­age­ment in April after banks de­manded re­pay­ment of loans as oil prices crashed amid the coro­n­avirus pan­demic – a col­lapse that re­vealed ear­lier fi­nan­cial trou­bles.</p>
    <p>Lim, also known as O. K. Lim, was ac­cused of in­sti­gat­ing a Hin Leong em­ployee to forge a doc­u­ment sup­pos­edly is­sued by UT Sin­ga­pore Ser­vices stat­ing that Hin Leong had trans­ferred more than one mil­lion bar­rels of gasoil to CAO.</p>
    <p>The doc­u­ment was then al­legedly used to se­cure more than US$56 mil­lion in trade fi­nanc­ing from a fi­nan­cial in­sti­tu­tion.</p>
