    <p>WASHINGTON • Twin ef­forts were un­der way in the United States Congress to reach a mas­sive govern­ment spend­ing deal that would avert a govern­ment shut­down, as Repub­li­cans and Democrats in­sisted they want to in­clude a fresh round of aid to a coron­avirus-hit na­tion.</p>
    <p>The lead­ers of both par­ties now ap­peared more up­beat about do­ing the first Covid-19 aid Bill since April, while a bi­par­ti­san group of law­mak­ers were pitch­ing their own ap­proach. The Covid-19 aid could be at­tached to a crit­i­cal spend­ing mea­sure that must be passed by Fri­day to avoid a fed­eral govern­ment shut­down.</p>
    <p>House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Trea­sury Sec­re­tary Steven Mnuchin dis­cussed both the govern­ment spend­ing Bill and a fresh round of Covid-19 re­lief on Mon­day, Pelosi spokesman Drew Ham­mill wrote on Twit­ter.</p>
    <p>Mrs Pelosi re­it­er­ated Demo­cratic con­cerns about the li­a­bil­ity pro­tec­tions against Covid-19 law­suits that Repub­li­cans seek, and said re­main­ing un­re­solved items in the spend­ing Bill could be re­solved eas­ily, Mr Ham­mill added.</p>
    <p>Lead­ing law­mak­ers were ham­mer­ing out the govern­ment spend­ing mea­sure, a US$1.4 tril­lion (S$1.9 tril­lion) Bill for the fis­cal year that be­gan on Oct 1.</p>
    <p>It would in­clude money for pro­grammes rang­ing from health­care, home­land se­cu­rity and mil­i­tary readi­ness to for­eign aid, na­tional parks and nutrition. These pro­grammes have been op­er­at­ing on tem­po­rary fund­ing.</p>
    <p>Se­na­tor John Cornyn, a se­nior Repub­li­can, said what was needed was an agree­ment on pan­demic re­lief be­tween Mrs Pelosi and Repub­li­can Se­nate Ma­jor­ity Leader Mitch McCon­nell. Mr Cornyn said he hoped for a re­sult by to­day.</p>
    <p>“I think they have been talk­ing, and I am con­fi­dent their staff are en­gaged,” he told re­porters.</p>
    <p>Se­nate Ap­pro­pri­a­tions Com­mit­tee chair­man Richard Shelby said the govern­ment spend­ing Bill could be filed as soon as yes­ter­day, and he hoped it would in­clude Covid-19 re­lief. “That is what I have al­ways pro­posed, I hope so. We have got to have an agree­ment on the Covid-19 stuff,” he told re­porters.</p>
    <p>With­out a spend­ing deal, the govern­ment would have to be­gin shut­ting down non-emer­gency pro­grammes and fur­lough­ing many work­ers in the midst of a pan­demic that has killed 300,000 Amer­i­cans, thrown mil­lions out of work, and is get­ting worse as win­ter sets in.</p>
    <p>Mr McCon­nell said his party was ready to pass some­thing on Covid-19, and called on Democrats to do the same in a speech that avoided some of the fin­ger-point­ing from both par­ties last week.</p>
    <p>A bi­par­ti­san group of law­mak­ers from both the House and Se­nate un­veiled their own pack­age, of­fer­ing two pro­pos­als that could be voted on sep­a­rately. One pack­age, a US$748 bil­lion pro­posal, in­cludes aid to small busi­nesses, the un­em­ployed and vac­cine dis­tri­bu­tion. It would of­fer US$300 weekly in ad­di­tional ben­e­fits to the un­em­ployed for 16 weeks.</p>
    <p>The other bi­par­ti­san pro­posal in­cludes the two main stick­ing points on Capi­tol Hill: li­a­bil­ity pro­tec­tions for busi­nesses, and US$160 bil­lion for state and lo­cal gov­ern­ments – a Demo­cratic pri­or­ity. But not even all of the bi­par­ti­san group of law­mak­ers sup­port it.</p>
    <p>Pres­i­dent-elect Joe Bi­den has urged Congress to act quickly on coron­avirus aid be­fore he takes of­fice on Jan 20.</p>
