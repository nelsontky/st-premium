    <p>The ac­ci­dent in which a part-time se­cu­rity of­fi­cer fell into a 4m-deep pit to his death at 1-Al­ti­tude rooftop bar last year could have been avoided if safety stan­dards had been ob­served, said the state coro­ner yesterday.</p>
    <p>Fol­low­ing an in­quiry into Mr Shaun Tung Mun Hon’s death, State Coro­ner Ka­mala Pon­nam­palam said there had been safety lapses at the bar lo­cated at One Raf­fles Place.</p>
    <p>Lawyer Wong Soo Chih, rep­re­sent­ing Mr Tung’s fam­ily who were in court yesterday, told The Straits Times after the hear­ing that her clients in­tend to sue the bar over the ac­ci­dent.</p>
    <p>1-Al­ti­tude is run by food and bev­er­age com­pany Syn­ergy in the Sky, which is part of 1-Group.</p>
    <p>It was re­vealed dur­ing the in­quiry that the open­ing Mr Tung, 26, fell into on June 9 last year had been ear­lier un­cov­ered by work­ers tasked with clean­ing the build­ing’s fa­cade.</p>
    <p>In­side the open­ing was a switch to op­er­ate a gon­dola used to clean the fa­cade of One Raf­fles Place, a 63-storey build­ing.</p>
    <p>The court had ear­lier heard that Mr Tung, a part-time guard, was shown the pit and briefed about it be­fore he started his shift at the al­fresco bar on the day of his death.</p>
    <p>Bar­ri­cades and warn­ing signs had been erected on the sec­ond floor of the nightspot, where the pit open­ing was lo­cated, to pre­vent guests from en­ter­ing the area.</p>
    <p>How­ever, the bar­ri­cades could be pushed aside and the area around the pit was not il­lu­mi­nated, said State Coro­ner Ka­mala.</p>
    <p>Mr Tung had spot­ted two men, who were not iden­ti­fied, en­ter­ing the cor­doned-off area at around 1.30am, the court had ear­lier heard.</p>
    <p>He ran to­wards the men while shin­ing his torch to warn them, but failed to spot the pit him­self and fell in.</p>
    <p>Mr Tung’s col­leagues saw him fall in, and his su­per­vi­sor, who rushed for­ward, saw him ly­ing face down at the bot­tom of the pit.</p>
    <p>Paramedics ar­rived at the scene and Mr Tung was pro­nounced dead about 30 min­utes later.</p>
    <p>The au­topsy re­vealed that he died from a head in­jury.</p>
    <p>Mr Tung, who has a young son, was cre­mated on June 11 last year.</p>
