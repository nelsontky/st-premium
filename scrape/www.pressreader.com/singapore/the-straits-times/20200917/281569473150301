    <p>Two men from very dif­fer­ent back­grounds man­aged to find ca­ma­raderie in a time of great ad­ver­sity. A se­nior in­ves­ti­ga­tion of­fi­cer with the Sin­ga­pore Po­lice Force’s Com­mer­cial Af­fairs De­part­ment and a worker from Bangladesh stay­ing at S11 Dor­mi­tory be­came friends dur­ing the of­fi­cer’s stint at pur­pose-built dor­mi­to­ries for for­eign work­ers.</p>
    <p>Even in the thick of a global pan­demic, two men from very dif­fer­ent worlds and back­grounds man­aged to find com­mon ground and ca­ma­raderie in a time of great ad­ver­sity.</p>
    <p>Mr Sheik Is­mail Mo­hamed Ashad, 37, is a se­nior in­ves­ti­ga­tion of­fi­cer with the Sin­ga­pore Po­lice Force’s Com­mer­cial Af­fairs De­part­ment, and Mr Mamoun Ab­dulla Al, 35, is a worker from Bangladesh stay­ing at the S11 Dor­mi­tory in Sele­tar North Link.</p>
    <p>They met – and be­came friends – when Mr Sheik was part of the For­ward As­sur­ance and Sup­port Teams (Fast) sta­tioned at pur­pose-built dor­mi­to­ries for for­eign work­ers.</p>
    <p>These teams com­prised 1,100 Home Team of­fi­cers from var­i­ous agen­cies who were de­ployed to dor­mi­to­ries to look after the well-be­ing of mi­grant work­ers, in­clud­ing at­tend­ing to their es­sen­tial needs, im­ple­ment­ing safe liv­ing mea­sures, and fa­cil­i­tat­ing med­i­cal test­ing for dor­mi­tory clear­ance op­er­a­tions.</p>
    <p>Mr Sheik vol­un­teered to be de­ployed to the dor­mi­tory as the Home Team over­saw the man­age­ment of 21 pur­pose-built dor­mi­to­ries and two de­cant sites, which housed more than 160,000 mi­grant work­ers. De­cant sites are used to house mi­grant work­ers em­ployed for es­sen­tial ser­vices.</p>
    <p>Despite the dire cir­cum­stances, Mr Sheik and Mr Mamoun formed an un­likely friend­ship. Mr Sheik often checked in on how Mr Mamoun was do­ing, while the lat­ter would go out of his way to make pas­tries and sugar cane juice for Mr Sheik in his free time.</p>
    <p>Mr Mamoun, who has been work­ing in Sin­ga­pore since 2008, was due to fly back to Bangladesh the day before lock­downs were im­posed on all the dor­mi­to­ries.</p>
    <p>He de­cided to make the best of a tough sit­u­a­tion, and got to work: help­ing to clean the dor­mi­to­ries, and re­lay­ing in­for­ma­tion from Mr Sheik and Fast of­fi­cers to other work­ers.</p>
    <p>This ca­ma­raderie kept Mr Sheik go­ing through the months he was sta­tioned at the dorms.</p>
    <p>“At first, the lan­guage bar­rier was an is­sue, be­cause of the di­ver­sity of work­ers in each dorm: but with the help of my col­leagues and friends like Mamoun, the com­mu­ni­ca­tion process got eas­ier ev­ery day,” said Mr Sheik.</p>
    <p>But Mr Sheik faced chal­lenges of his own dur­ing his two sec­ond­ments to S11 which be­gan in April and ended on July 31.</p>
    <p>He also feared that his de­ploy­ment to the dorm would put his el­derly par­ents – who are both in their 60s and suf­fer from chronic ill­nesses – at risk.</p>
    <p>“I am so grate­ful to my par­ents for be­ing sup­port­ive of my work, and on my end, I took all the pre­cau­tions I could: es­sen­tially so­cially dis­tanc­ing from my own fam­ily, and dis­in­fect­ing my­self mul­ti­ple times ev­ery day when I got home,” he said.</p>
    <p>Despite these wor­ries, Mr Sheik vol­un­teered to re­turn to the dor­mi­tory for a sec­ond de­ploy­ment. He also found him­self step­ping up in other ways and go­ing be­yond the call of duty to help the work­ers un­der his care. He re­called help­ing a mi­grant worker who had been the vic­tim of a bank­ing phish­ing scam to make a po­lice re­port.</p>
    <p>“The ex­pe­ri­ence was over­whelm­ing at times, but very re­ward­ing. Some of the big­gest take­aways for me were re­ally that ev­ery­one should be treated equally, and with re­spect, and that good team­work is so es­sen­tial to get­ting things done,” Mr Sheik said.</p>
    <p>On Tues­day, all Fast of­fi­cers sta­tioned at the dorms stood down from their de­ploy­ment, as the newly set-up As­sur­ance, Care and En­gage­ment Group un­der the Min­istry of Man­power is tak­ing over the in­ter­a­gency task force’s work, and will be fully op­er­a­tional by Oct 1.</p>
