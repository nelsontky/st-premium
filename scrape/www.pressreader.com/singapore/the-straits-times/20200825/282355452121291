    <p>TOKYO • Next year’s Par­a­lympics need to be able to guar­an­tee zero coro­n­avirus cases, the head of the global as­so­ci­a­tion has said, adding that the Games can­not go ahead if pro­tec­tion mea­sures do not im­prove.</p>
    <p>The warn­ing from In­ter­na­tional Par­a­lympic Com­mit­tee (IPC) pres­i­dent An­drew Par­sons comes as Tokyo marked one year to the post­poned Games yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Un­like their able-bod­ied coun­ter­parts, the Brazil­ian ad­mit­ted some para-ath­letes were par­tic­u­larly vul­ner­a­ble to Covid-19, and that at cur­rent risk lev­els, the Par­a­lympics were not fea­si­ble.</p>
    <p>“If the sit­u­a­tion was like it is to­day... if we were go­ing to start to­mor­row, we could not go ahead,” he told Agence France-Presse in an in­ter­view. “We need to learn more, pre­pare bet­ter.”</p>
    <p>Af­ter a re­cent surge in coro­n­avirus cases, Tokyo is skip­ping the sort of pub­lic events held last year to mark 12 months be­fore the orig­i­nal start date.</p>
    <p>The un­prece­dented de­ci­sion to de­lay the Tokyo Olympics and Par­a­lympics by a year has cre­ated a lo­gis­ti­cal night­mare for or­gan­is­ers, and con­cerns re­main over whether they can safely take place at all.</p>
    <p>Par­sons be­lieves cur­rent so­cial dis­tanc­ing mea­sures and stan­dards for test­ing and trac­ing would not be enough to pro­tect some 4,350 paraath­letes plus staff, fans, vol­un­teers and the me­dia.</p>
    <p>“We are not work­ing with ac­cept­able lev­els of risk. This is the bot­tom line, this is where we draw the line in the sand,” he said. “How we can en­sure that we will not have one sin­gle case? One sin­gle case in the vil­lage can re­ally dis­rupt the Games.”</p>
    <p>Ex­actly what mea­sures will be nec­es­sary, and pos­si­ble, re­mains to be seen. Tokyo 2020 or­gan­is­ers, to­gether with Olympic and Par­a­lympic of­fi­cials, are ex­pected to be­gin dis­cus­sions next month on ev­ery­thing from quar­an­tine mea­sures to bar­ring fans.</p>
    <p>Ac­knowl­edg­ing the com­plex­ity and scale of the Games, Par­sons said: “This is why I’m say­ing, if we don’t dis­cover bet­ter ways of do­ing it, so­cial dis­tanc­ing, mon­i­tor­ing, test­ing, it will be very dif­fi­cult.</p>
    <p>“What we need to have dif­fer­ent from what the Olympic ath­letes have is not the pro­tec­tion to pre­vent them from be­ing con­tam­i­nated, it’s what hap­pens if they get con­tam­i­nated, be­cause it can be re­ally se­vere, re­ally fast.</p>
    <p>“The stan­dard we have to take is, it doesn’t mat­ter if you have a dis­abil­ity or not, you don’t get the virus, full stop.”</p>
    <p>A poll of Ja­panese Par­a­lympic ath­letes pub­lished on Sun­day by the</p>
    <p>Kyodo News Agency found more than 70 per cent are wor­ried about train­ing be­cause of Covid-19.</p>
    <p>On the like­li­hood of a scaled­down Games, Par­sons added the IPC was on alert to en­sure that the cost-cut­ting mea­sures did not in­volve lower stan­dards of ac­ces­si­bil­ity, which he called “non-ne­go­tiable”.</p>
