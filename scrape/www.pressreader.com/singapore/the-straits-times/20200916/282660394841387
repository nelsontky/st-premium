    <p>Arlo makes some of the best wire­free home se­cu­rity cam­eras in the mar­ket. But they are pricey and re­quire a smart hub that con­nects to the home router.</p>
    <p>These down­sides have been rec­ti­fied in the new Arlo Essen­tial cam­era. At $239, it is more bud­get­friendly than oth­ers in the range, es­pe­cially when com­pared with the price tag of $799 for two Arlo Pro 3 cam­eras and a smart hub.</p>
    <p>The lat­ter is no longer nec­es­sary for the Essen­tial, as the new cam­era can con­nect di­rectly to your home Wi-Fi via the 2.4GHz chan­nel.</p>
    <p>If you al­ready have a com­pat­i­ble Arlo smart hub, the Essen­tial can con­nect to it for bet­ter wire­less range and per­for­mance.</p>
    <p>This hub can also be a repos­i­tory for recorded videos with a USBat­tached drive or mem­ory card.</p>
    <p>As its name sug­gests, Arlo has stripped the ex­tras from the Essen­tial. It cap­tures 1,080p videos, not quad-HD ones like the Arlo Pro 3.</p>
    <p>There is no sup­port for high dy­namic range (HDR) and the cam­era’s field of view has been re­duced to 130 de­grees from the Pro 3’s 160 de­grees.</p>
    <p>These changes are rea­son­able. The Essen­tial’s video qual­ity is de­cent with­out bar­rel dis­tor­tion.</p>
    <p>But a change for the worse is that, un­like the Arlo Pro cam­eras, the Essen­tial does not have a re­mov­able bat­tery.</p>
    <p>This means you can­not swop bat­ter­ies when the Essen­tial cam­era is run­ning out of juice. In­stead, you have to re­move the en­tire cam­era unit by un­screw­ing it from the in­cluded mount for charg­ing, which can be a has­sle if it is placed in a less ac­ces­si­ble lo­ca­tion.</p>
    <p>To make mat­ters worse, the Essen­tial’s bat­tery de­pletes quickly when used in a high-traf­fic lo­ca­tion like a com­mon cor­ri­dor or lift lobby.</p>
    <p>In my test, the bat­tery loses 13 per cent of its charge in just three days, even though it is ac­tive only from mid­night to 7am.</p>
    <p>The Essen­tial re­tains the Arlo Pro 3’s spot­light and siren. The for­mer en­ables colour videos even in low light and is also a de­ter­rent for would-be in­trud­ers.</p>
    <p>If more deter­rence is re­quired, you can man­u­ally ac­ti­vate the builtin siren through the app or set a rule to turn on the siren when the cam­era de­tects mo­tion. At 80 deci­bels, the siren is not as ear-pierc­ing as the 100 deci­bels pro­duced by the Pro 3.</p>
    <p>Like other Arlo Pro cam­eras, the Essen­tial’s full po­ten­tial is un­locked only with an Arlo Smart subscripti­on plan, which starts at $4.49 a month (three months free in­cluded with the Essen­tial).</p>
    <p>This ser­vice pro­vides 30-day rolling cloud video record­ings and taps ar­ti­fi­cial in­tel­li­gence to dis­tin­guish whether the mo­tion de­tected by the cam­era is caused by a per­son, a ve­hi­cle or an an­i­mal.</p>
    <p>Arlo Smart also lets you ad­just the mo­tion-de­tec­tion fea­ture to focus only on cus­tom ac­tiv­ity zones in the cam­era’s field of view, which helps to re­duce false alarms.</p>
    <p>In my test, the Arlo app (avail­able for iOS and An­droid) is slow to alert me when mo­tion is de­tected by the cam­era, tak­ing up to eight sec­onds for the no­ti­fi­ca­tion to ar­rive.</p>
    <p>Turn­ing on the cam­era’s re­al­time live view also takes around four to five sec­onds com­pared with three sec­onds for a ri­val cam­era brand.</p>
    <p>I am not cer­tain if the de­lays are due to the lack of a smart hub, but the Essen­tial feels slightly off-pace com­pared with the Arlo Pro mod­els.</p>
    <p>On the bright side, the Essen­tial is easy to set up. Sim­ply point the cam­era at a QR code in the Arlo app and en­ter your Wi-Fi net­work cre­den­tials when prompted. There is no need to set up a smart hub or in­sert re­mov­able bat­ter­ies, un­like with the Arlo Pro cam­eras.</p>
