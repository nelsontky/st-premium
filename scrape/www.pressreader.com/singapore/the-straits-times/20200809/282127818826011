    <p>NEW YORK • A New York judge has re­jected US Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump’s bid to tem­po­rar­ily halt pro­ceed­ings in a law­suit filed against him by writer E. Jean Car­roll, who has ac­cused him of rape, a rul­ing that al­lows the case to move for­ward in the months be­fore the pres­i­den­tial elec­tion.</p>
    <p>The de­ci­sion was a vic­tory for Ms Car­roll, who sued Mr Trump in Novem­ber for defama­tion af­ter he called her a liar and said he had never met her. She pub­lished a mem­oir last sum­mer that ac­cused Mr Trump of at­tack­ing her in a depart­ment store dress­ing room in Man­hat­tan in the 1990s.</p>
    <p>Lawyers for Mr Trump had sought to put the law­suit on hold while an ap­peals court is de­cid­ing whether to dis­miss a sim­i­lar law­suit filed against Mr Trump by Ms Sum­mer Zer­vos, a former con­tes­tant on The Ap­pren­tice who has ac­cused him of sex­u­ally as­sault­ing her.</p>
    <p>In their bid for a de­lay, the lawyers also said the Con­sti­tu­tion gave a sit­ting pres­i­dent im­mu­nity against law­suits in state court.</p>
    <p>On Thurs­day, Jus­tice Verna Saunders in New York re­jected their ar­gu­ments, point­ing to a re­cent US Supreme Court rul­ing that con­cluded that Mr Trump could not block a sub­poena for his tax re­turns by the Man­hat­tan Dis­trict At­tor­ney’s Of­fice.</p>
    <p>The Supreme Court rul­ing de­ter­mined that the Pres­i­dent did not pos­sess ab­so­lute im­mu­nity against state crim­i­nal sub­poe­nas.</p>
    <p>Although that rul­ing per­tained to a crim­i­nal in­ves­ti­ga­tion, Jus­tice Saunders wrote that the same le­gal ques­tion was rel­e­vant to Ms Car­roll’s law­suit – “whether the Supremacy Clause of the Con­sti­tu­tion bars a state court from ex­er­cis­ing ju­ris­dic­tion over a sit­ting pres­i­dent of the United States dur­ing his term”.</p>
    <p>“No, it does not,” the judge wrote. She said the Supreme Court’s rul­ing ap­plied to “all state court pro­ceed­ings in which a sit­ting pres­i­dent is in­volved”, in­clud­ing those in­volv­ing the pres­i­dent’s un­of­fi­cial or per­sonal con­duct.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump’s lawyers, who did not re­spond to a re­quest for com­ment, could ap­peal against the rul­ing.</p>
    <p>For now, the rul­ing al­lows the law­suit to en­ter the cru­cial dis­cov­ery phase, in which both sides will ex­change doc­u­ments and other ma­te­ri­als. Lawyers for Ms Car­roll had re­quested that Mr Trump pro­vide a DNA sam­ple to de­ter­mine whether his ge­netic ma­te­rial is on a dress that Ms Car­roll said she was wear­ing at the time of the in­ci­dent.</p>
    <p>The rul­ing also means that both Ms Car­roll and Mr Trump could sit for de­po­si­tions un­der oath in the com­ing months.</p>
    <p>Ms Roberta Ka­plan, a lawyer for Ms Car­roll, said: “We are now ea­ger to move for­ward with dis­cov­ery so that we can prove that Don­ald</p>
    <p>Trump de­famed E. Jean Car­roll when he lied about her in con­nec­tion with her brave de­ci­sion to tell the truth about the fact that Don­ald Trump had sex­u­ally as­saulted her.”</p>
    <p>Some of the find­ings dur­ing dis­cov­ery could be dis­closed pub­licly in court fil­ings be­fore the Novem­ber elec­tion, although Mr Trump’s lawyers could seek other av­enues to de­lay the case.</p>
    <p>In a book ex­cerpt pub­lished in June last year, Ms Car­roll, a long­time colum­nist for Elle magazine, wrote that Mr Trump threw her up against the wall of a dress­ing room at Bergdorf Good­man, an upscale depart­ment store in Man­hat­tan, and forced him­self on her. She said the episode oc­curred in late 1995 or early 1996. She had kept the black wool dress that she was wear­ing that day, she wrote.</p>
    <p>Ms Car­roll an­nounced ear­lier this year that she had de­parted from Elle, say­ing the magazine fired her af­ter Mr Trump in­sulted her rep­u­ta­tion. Her con­tract was ter­mi­nated early, but Elle said it was not over her al­le­ga­tions against him.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump has de­nied Ms Car­roll’s al­le­ga­tions. He said he did not know her, even though the two were pho­tographed to­gether at a party in 1987 with Ms Car­roll’s former hus­band. Mr Trump later said that the im­age was mis­lead­ing.</p>
    <p>He also said Ms Car­roll had fab­ri­cated the episode to sell her book and that she was “not my type”.</p>
    <p>Ms Car­roll is one of more than 10 women who have ac­cused Mr Trump of sex­ual mis­con­duct be­fore he was pres­i­dent. He has de­nied all of the ac­cu­sa­tions.</p>
