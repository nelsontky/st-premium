    <p>LOS AN­GE­LES • Amer­i­can elec­tri­cal engi­neer Grant Ima­hara, who co-hosted the pop science show MythBuster­s (2003 to 2018) on the Dis­cov­ery Chan­nel and op­er­ated ro­bots in the Star Wars pre­quels (1999 to 2005) and other ma­jor Hol­ly­wood films, died on Mon­day. He was 49.</p>
    <p>A com­pany spokesman for Dis­cov­ery said the cause was be­lieved to be a brain aneurysm.</p>
    <p>“We are heart­bro­ken to hear this sad news about Grant,” Dis­cov­ery said in a state­ment. “He was an im­por­tant part of our Dis­cov­ery fam­ily and a won­der­ful man. Our thoughts and prayers go out to his fam­ily.”</p>
    <p>Ima­hara was born in Los An­ge­les and grad­u­ated in 1993 with a de­gree in elec­tri­cal engi­neer­ing from the Univer­sity of South­ern Cal­i­for­nia.</p>
    <p>He later worked as an an­i­ma­tron­ics engi­neer and model-maker for In­dus­trial Light & Magic, a de­signer of movie spe­cial ef­fects that was f ounded by di­rec­tor Ge­orge Lu­cas in 1975.</p>
    <p>Ima­hara op­er­ated the R2-D2 droid in the Star Wars pre­quels. He also worked on Ter­mi­na­tor 3: Rise Of The Ma­chines (2003), di­rec­tor Steven Spiel­berg’s The Lost World: Juras­sic Park (1997) and the Ma­trix se­quels (2003), among other films, and de­vel­oped a cus­tom cir­cuit for the En­er­gizer Bunny’s arms and ears.</p>
    <p>Ima­hara worked on MythBuster­s from 2005 to 2014, ini­tially as a mem­ber of its “build team”. Asked in a 2008 in­ter­view with the web­site MachineDe­sign what a typ­i­cal day on the show l ooked like, Ima­hara replied that there was no such thing.</p>
    <p>“We could be j ump­ing out of planes, l earn­ing to swing on a trapeze, swim­ming with sharks and the list goes on and on,” he said. “We usu­ally find out what we’re do­ing for the week on Mon­day morn­ing.”</p>
    <p>Along with his for­mer MythBuster­s co-hosts Kari By­ron and Tory Bel­leci, Ima­hara later co­hosted White Rab­bit Pro­ject, a show on Net­flix that looked back on his­tory’s great­est in­ven­tions and heists. It ran for one sea­son in 2016.</p>
    <p>In March, he shared on his Face­book page how he made his own an­i­ma­tronic Baby Yoda, the pop­u­lar char­ac­ter from the Star Wars se­ries The Man­dalo­rian (2019).</p>
