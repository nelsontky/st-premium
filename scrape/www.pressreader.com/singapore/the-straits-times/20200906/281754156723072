    <p>It is 10.30pm on a Tues­day night and the bar ta­bles at Bangkok’s Sugar Club are fill­ing up. As the dee­jay turns up the vol­ume, two women in biki­nis and face shields stride on stage. Strangers flirt.</p>
    <p>Step onto the street out­side in Sukhumvit Soi 11, and the party fiz­zles out. Empty bars blast mu­sic into the thor­ough­fare that teemed with tourists be­fore the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Two months af­ter Thai­land al­lowed bars and clubs to re­open, Bangkok’s nightlife is slowly com­ing back from the dead.</p>
    <p>But the party cap­i­tal is now grap­pling with bi­sect­ing for­tunes.</p>
    <p>Busi­nesses that rely on a Thai clien­tele are see­ing crowds re­turn.</p>
    <p>Those geared to tourists are des­o­late, or have sim­ply closed down.</p>
    <p>Be­fore Thurs­day, when Thai­land logged a case of com­mu­nity in­fec­tion, the coun­try had gone for 100 days with­out any lo­cal trans­mis­sion. There are so far more than 3,400 cases of in­fec­tion and 58 deaths from the coro­n­avirus.</p>
    <p>Wary of a sec­ond wave of in­fec­tions like in Myan­mar and Viet­nam, the Thai govern­ment has shut its doors to most tourists.</p>
    <p>It is still hop­ing to re­tain a slice of the long-stay mar­ket by ex­per­i­ment­ing with more re­laxed quar­an­tine re­quire­ments on Phuket.</p>
    <p>But the eco­nomic prog­no­sis is grim. The Thai econ­omy is set to shrink by 8.5 per cent this year.</p>
    <p>One can hardly tell, judg­ing by the rev­ellers on a Mon­day night in Bangkok’s Thon­glor dis­trict.</p>
    <p>Ainu, a bar with live mu­sic, was packed with lo­cals.</p>
    <p>“We are get­ting 100 per cent of our cus­tomers back, or maybe even more than be­fore,” said its man­ager Sa­sitorn Thanawat.</p>
    <p>Just be­fore the nightspots were al­lowed to re­open in July, the Cen­tre for Covid-19 Sit­u­a­tion Ad­min­is­tra­tion had pro­posed a long list of rules that re­quired es­tab­lish­ments to not just main­tain dis­tanc­ing but also shut at mid­night and stop guests from singing and danc­ing.</p>
    <p>But op­er­a­tors have qui­etly ig­nored some curbs.</p>
    <p>“Af­ter the first three weeks, ev­ery­body was try­ing to get back to nor­mal,” said Mr Sanga Ruang­wat­tanakul, pres­i­dent of the Khaosan Road Busi­ness As­so­ci­a­tion.</p>
    <p>“We can­not op­er­ate en­ter­tain­ment es­tab­lish­ments with this kind of prac­tice.” Still, bars and clubs make staff wear masks and face shields, clean their hands with al­co­hol, take their guests’ tem­per­a­tures and limit ca­pac­i­ties.</p>
    <p>Pan­thera Group, which runs Sugar Club as well as In­san­ity – one of the largest clubs in Bangkok – has changed its busi­ness model.</p>
    <p>“With Sugar, a well-es­tab­lished brand in the Thai mar­ket, for the most part we just opened the doors and peo­ple were there,” said Pan­thera’s mar­ket­ing di­rec­tor Ben­jamin Bask­ins.</p>
    <p>But In­san­ity was badly af­fected as half of its pa­trons were from other coun­tries like China, Sin­ga­pore and Malaysia. To at­tract more Thai club­bers, Pan­thera tweaked</p>
    <p>In­san­ity’s mu­sic se­lec­tion and low­ered prices by 30 to 50 per cent.</p>
    <p>“We are af­ter break-even,” said Mr Bask­ins. “We have set­tled on the fact that we are re­ally not go­ing to be in the profit zone.”</p>
    <p>Sing Sing The­ater, an up­scale club which re­opened in late July but chose to op­er­ate four days a week in­stead of six, is run­ning at full or nearly full ca­pac­ity ev­ery night.</p>
    <p>“We have not com­pletely re­cov­ered,” said its gen­eral man­ager Jonathan Sik­sik.</p>
