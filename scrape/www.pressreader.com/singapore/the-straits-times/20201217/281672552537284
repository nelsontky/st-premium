    <p>In­dia hopes to launch its first hu­man mis­sion into space in 2022.</p>
    <p>But some In­di­ans, mean­while, still have to de­scend into sew­ers and sep­tic tanks to clean them – an ab­hor­rent prac­tice that fre­quently leads to their deaths.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to of­fi­cial data, 390 in­di­vid­u­als died clean­ing sew­ers be­tween March 2015 and last month by drown­ing in fae­cal sludge or as­phyx­i­a­tion by nox­ious gases.</p>
    <p>Many say this num­ber does not re­flect the ac­tual death toll from this haz­ardous prac­tice.</p>
    <p>Hav­ing long strug­gled to put an end to this ig­nominy, the In­dian gov­ern­ment has now boosted its com­mit­ment to mech­a­nise the clean­ing of sew­ers and sep­tic tanks.</p>
    <p>On World Toi­let Day on Nov 19, the gov­ern­ment an­nounced a host of ini­tia­tives to re­alise this goal.</p>
    <p>Key among them is the for­mu­la­tion of a na­tional pol­icy for a mech­a­nised san­i­ta­tion ecosys­tem to elim­i­nate man­ual clean­ing of sew­ers and sep­tic tanks and pre­vent associated ac­ci­dents.</p>
    <p>Ms Yogita Swa­roop, an eco­nomic ad­viser with the Min­istry of So­cial Jus­tice and Em­pow­er­ment, one of the key gov­ern­ment stake­hold­ers in this ini­tia­tive, told The Straits Times that the new ini­tia­tive en­vis­ages set­ting up a san­i­ta­tion re­sponse unit in each mu­nic­i­pal­ity that will be equipped with ma­chines.</p>
    <p>It will also have pro­fes­sion­ally trained man­power and a helpline to at­tend to com­plaints.</p>
    <p>In ad­di­tion, a re­spon­si­ble san­i­ta­tion au­thor­ity will be cre­ated in each district to over­see mech­a­ni­sa­tion-re­lated tasks.</p>
    <p>The gov­ern­ment also pro­poses to re­place the term “man­hole” with “ma­chine hole” in its doc­u­ments.</p>
    <p>San­i­ta­tion work­ers, many of whom are em­ployed by pri­vate con­trac­tors, will be en­cour­aged to form self-help groups so that they can di­rectly ac­cess gov­ern­ment fi­nan­cial sup­port to buy clean­ing ma­chines.</p>
    <p>In­dian law pro­hibits haz­ardous clean­ing of sew­ers and sep­tic tanks, a task that is officially dis­tin­guished from man­ual scav­eng­ing.</p>
    <p>A “man­ual scav­enger” is some­one who man­u­ally cleans and dis­poses of hu­man exc­reta from “in­san­i­tary la­trines”. This term is used for a toi­let that re­quires exc­reta to be cleaned man­u­ally, ei­ther on­site, or from an open drain or a pit.</p>
    <p>In­dia first banned the em­ploy­ment of hu­mans as man­ual scav­engers in 1993. In 2013, a new piece of leg­is­la­tion re­in­forced this ban by pro­hibit­ing all forms of man­ual scav­eng­ing and re­quir­ing the iden­ti­fi­ca­tion – as well as re­ha­bil­i­ta­tion – of man­ual scav­engers.</p>
    <p>But these rules have had lit­tle im­pact, with peo­ple still en­gaged in man­ual scav­eng­ing and haz­ardous clean­ing of sew­ers and sep­tic tanks.</p>
    <p>These tasks ex­ploit and per­pet­u­ate an an­cient so­ci­etal in­equity.</p>
    <p>An es­ti­mated 1.2 mil­lion peo­ple un­der­take this work, 95 per cent of whom are Dal­its, one of the most marginalis­ed groups and placed at the bot­tom of the coun­try’s caste hi­er­ar­chy.</p>
    <p>The gov­ern­ment has also launched an ap­pli­ca­tion to al­low in­di­vid­u­als to geo­tag in­san­i­tary toi­lets and up­load de­tails of work­ers clean­ing them man­u­ally.</p>
    <p>This in­for­ma­tion will be passed on to the lo­cal author­i­ties so that they re­place such toi­lets with ones that are con­nected to a drainage sys­tem or those that al­low on-site treat­ment of fae­cal mat­ter.</p>
    <p>Man­ual scav­engers are also to be re­ha­bil­i­tated with gov­ern­ment fi­nan­cial sup­port.</p>
    <p>While Ms Swa­roop said In­dia is “man­ual-scav­eng­ing free”, Safai Karam­chari An­dolan (SKA), an or­gan­i­sa­tion that rep­re­sents the in­ter­ests of san­i­ta­tion work­ers, said man­ual scav­eng­ing is still prac­tised in as many as 101 dis­tricts, in a re­port sub­mit­ted to the gov­ern­ment in Septem­ber.</p>
    <p>Mr Bezwada Wil­son, the SKA’s na­tional con­vener who was born to man­ual scav­eng­ing par­ents, said a key chal­lenge is that scav­engers, in­clud­ing those who clean sew­ers and sep­tic tanks, are yet to be iden­ti­fied by the gov­ern­ment.</p>
    <p>Many man­ual scav­engers, he added, are “ter­rorised” by the lo­cal author­i­ties and not re­ha­bil­i­tated, which has made them fur­ther reluc­tant to officially de­clare their scav­eng­ing sta­tus.</p>
    <p>“The gov­ern­ment has to first iden­tify the peo­ple and look at this prob­lem from the per­spec­tive of the scav­engers,” he said.</p>
    <p>“There is no as­sess­ment of the prob­lem. Just dec­la­ra­tion af­ter dec­la­ra­tion, that is what is hap­pen­ing.”</p>
    <p>Knowl­edge of their caste back­ground and a more em­pa­thetic un­der­stand­ing of so­cio-eco­nomic fac­tors that “suf­fo­cate them and pre­vent them from com­ing out of this prac­tice” is what Mr Wil­son pre­scribed.</p>
    <p>The SKA says there have been 1,760 deaths caused by haz­ardous clean­ing of fae­cal mat­ter since 1993, with com­pen­sa­tion still elu­sive for many.</p>
    <p>Ms Swa­roop said end­ing un­hy­gienic man­ual clean­ing of sew­ers and sep­tic tanks is “un­doubt­edly a chal­leng­ing task” but one that is “achiev­able with so­ci­etal sup­port”.</p>
    <p>It is a chal­lenge even in In­dia’s cap­i­tal, where nar­row al­leys and poorly con­structed sep­tic tanks, of­ten in vi­o­la­tion of build­ing laws, make mech­a­nised clean­ing im­pos­si­ble in cer­tain cases.</p>
    <p>Mr Prem Singh Taank, a san­i­ta­tion worker with the Delhi Jal Board, said there were times when he had to stave off pres­sure from his se­niors to de­scend into sew­ers.</p>
    <p>“The task is then car­ried out by a pri­vate con­trac­tor who re­lies on in­for­mal labour to do it man­u­ally,” he added.</p>
