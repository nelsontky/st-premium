    <p>I agree that it is not fair to ex­pect a maid to be both house­keeper and care­giver (Maids can­not be trained to be su­per­hu­mans,</p>
    <p>Nov 14).</p>
    <p>Care­giv­ing in it­self is a very in­ten­sive job, phys­i­cally, men­tally and emo­tion­ally. To ex­pect a maid to do this and also house­keep is un­ac­cept­able.</p>
    <p>When my maid was em­ployed to care for my el­derly mother who suf­fered a stroke, I told my maid that she need not do house­work if she was busy car­ing for my mother.</p>
    <p>I al­ways re­mind her that tak­ing care of my mother is the pri­or­ity and clean­ing the house can be done when she has time, like when my mother is nap­ping.</p>
    <p>When I re­turn from work, I take over car­ing for my mother to give my maid a break and I do the house­work that she was not able to com­plete.</p>
    <p>An em­ployer must help the maid as it’s sim­ply not pos­si­ble for her to do both house­work and be a care­giver. This will help keep the maid from get­ting stressed and ex­pe­ri­enc­ing burnout, or fall­ing sick due to ex­haus­tion. When the maid is tired, she can­not care well for the el­derly per­son.</p>
    <p>The prob­lem is that many em­ploy­ers ex­pect the maid to do ev­ery­thing just be­cause they are pay­ing her a salary.</p>
