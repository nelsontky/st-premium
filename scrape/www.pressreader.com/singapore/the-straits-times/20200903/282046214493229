    <p>Higher rail re­li­a­bil­ity has come at a sub­stan­tial cost, with tax­pay­ers hav­ing to sub­sidise rail op­er­a­tions by nearly $600 mil­lion last year.</p>
    <p>This is a stark change from be­fore the New Rail Fi­nanc­ing Frame­work (NRFF) came into full ef­fect in 2018, when op­er­a­tors owned op­er­at­ing as­sets like trains and funded re­place­ments with fares – a regime which worked ini­tially, but even­tu­ally re­sulted in patchy ser­vice.</p>
    <p>Un­der NRFF, the Gov­ern­ment owns all as­sets, and op­er­a­tors pay a li­cens­ing charge and col­lect fare rev­enue. The charges can vary ac­cord­ing to an op­er­a­tor’s prof­itabil­ity.</p>
    <p>In re­sponse to queries from The Straits Times, the Land Trans­port Author­ity (LTA) said li­cens­ing fee col­lec­tion for the fi­nan­cial year ended on March 31 last year “was only around $3 mil­lion”, as rail op­er­a­tions have not been prof­itable.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, there was a de­pre­ci­a­tion charge of about $578 mil­lion in op­er­at­ing as­sets for the same year, the LTA said. “The dif­fer­ence will need to be sub­sidised by the Gov­ern­ment, as op­er­at­ing sub­sidy.”</p>
    <p>When the li­cence charge paid by op­er­a­tors to use op­er­at­ing as­sets is not enough to cover the de­pre­ci­a­tion cost of even­tu­ally re­plac­ing them, the Gov­ern­ment will have to use tax­payer monies to top up the dif­fer­ence. The sub­sidy, which is put into a rail­way sink­ing fund man­aged by the LTA, en­sures that there will be suf­fi­cient funds set aside for the even­tual re­newal of the sys­tem, an LTA spokesman said.</p>
    <p>She at­trib­uted the op­er­a­tors’ poor fi­nan­cials to re­cent ef­forts to im­prove rail re­li­a­bil­ity that have in­creased their costs. The MRT net­work cur­rently has one de­lay for ev­ery 1.6 mil­lion train-km clocked, com­pared with 133,000 train-km in 2015.</p>
    <p>Much of the im­prove­ment came from the re­newal of the NorthSouth and East-West lines that cost more than $2.5 bil­lion to un­der­take.</p>
    <p>Be­yond that, op­er­a­tors have had to do sig­nif­i­cantly more pre­ven­tive main­te­nance, which of­ten en­tails chang­ing parts well be­fore they wear out. This is a change from the pre­vi­ous practice of car­ry­ing out largely cor­rec­tive main­te­nance.</p>
    <p>The LTA said: “Com­muters ben­e­fit from this shift, and we have seen a de­ci­sive shift from pri­vate to pub­lic trans­port over the years.”</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore Univer­sity of So­cial Sciences trans­port econ­o­mist Wal­ter Th­e­seira reck­ons the coun­try is headed for “an even­tual gov­ern­ment bailout” of rail op­er­a­tors if they are con­sis­tently un­prof­itable.</p>
    <p>He noted that if rail op­er­a­tors’ lack of prof­itabil­ity is be­cause the fare rev­enue they col­lect is not enough to cover the level of rail ser­vice de­manded by reg­u­la­tors and op­er­a­tors, “then it is ac­tu­ally more ap­pro­pri­ate for the Gov­ern­ment to just sub­sidise the sys­tem trans­par­ently, the same way that buses are sub­sidised”.</p>
    <p>Dr Th­e­seira added that the bus con­tract­ing model – where the Gov­ern­ment pays op­er­a­tors fixed fees to run ser­vices and col­lects fares – would al­low for more trans­parency and pre­dictabil­ity in the sub­sidy amount. It could also al­low for more com­pe­ti­tion and thus cost bench­mark­ing.</p>
    <p>But he noted that the Gov­ern­ment spent about $1 bil­lion on bus sub­si­dies last year. This came about when fare rev­enue fell short of the value of con­tracts awarded to op­er­a­tors.</p>
    <p>The con­tract­ing model has been pos­i­tive for bus op­er­a­tors, though. SBS Tran­sit posted record earn­ings of $80.1 mil­lion for the year ended Dec 31, 2018.</p>
    <p>Ob­servers reckon costs will have to be re­cov­ered partly through fare ad­just­ments.</p>
    <p>In an in­ter­view with Lianhe Zaobao ear­lier this week, Trans­port Minister Ong Ye Kung noted that Deputy Prime Minister Heng Swee Keat had an­nounced that there will be no in­crease in gov­ern­ment fees be­cause of the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Al­though pub­lic trans­port fares are not con­sid­ered gov­ern­ment fees, Mr Ong said he hopes the Pub­lic Trans­port Coun­cil (PTC) “will also take this pol­icy into con­sid­er­a­tion” dur­ing its an­nual fare re­view ex­er­cise.</p>
    <p>Re­spond­ing on how it would act in the ex­er­cise, slated to start this month, the PTC said it con­sid­ers “all rel­e­vant in­for­ma­tion, in­clud­ing the macroe­co­nomic in­dices and pre­vail­ing eco­nomic con­di­tions as well as the need to bal­ance fare af­ford­abil­ity, fi­nan­cial sus­tain­abil­ity and the im­pact of its fare de­ci­sion on var­i­ous com­muter groups”.</p>
    <p>The coun­cil said it will an­nounce its de­ci­sion when it is ready.</p>
