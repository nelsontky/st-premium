    <p>Is­lamic re­li­gious leaders have helped Malay Mus­lims forge a pro­gres­sive iden­tity while be­ing re­spect­ful to Sin­ga­pore’s lo­cal con­text, Min­is­ter in the Prime Min­is­ter’s Of­fice Ma­liki Os­man said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>He lauded their ef­forts in steer­ing the com­mu­nity through sen­si­tive is­sues, and said main­tain­ing re­li­gious har­mony re­quires the ef­fort of ev­ery­one, in­clud­ing Malay Mus­lims. That is why the role of Malay-Mus­lim re­li­gious leaders is cru­cial, he said.</p>
    <p>“The essence of lead­er­ship is the abil­ity to make sound and well-con­sid­ered de­ci­sions, even if they are un­pop­u­lar and are dif­fi­cult to be ac­cepted by some seg­ments, but should be done in the in­ter­est of the larger com­mu­nity and so­ci­ety,” he added.</p>
    <p>Speak­ing in Par­lia­ment dur­ing the de­bate on the Pres­i­dent’s Ad­dress, Dr Ma­liki, who is also Sec­ond Min­is­ter for Ed­u­ca­tion and For­eign Af­fairs, touched on how the Covid-19 pan­demic has posed un­prece­dented chal­lenges for Malay Mus­lims.</p>
    <p>He spoke about how Is­lamic re­li­gious leaders have had to make tough de­ci­sions to help stop the virus’ spread, such as sus­pend­ing Fri­day prayers in mosques and de­fer­ring this year’s haj pil­grim­age. He said he was grate­ful that the re­li­gious leaders acted early.</p>
    <p>He also urged the Malay-Mus­lim com­mu­nity to help its more vul­ner­a­ble mem­bers level up, and pledged that the Govern­ment will con­tinue do­ing the same.</p>
    <p>To that end, one such ef­fort is the Up­lift pro­gramme by the Ed­u­ca­tion and So­cial and Fam­ily De­vel­op­ment min­istries, he said. Un­der the pro­gramme, a co­or­di­na­tor works with dis­ad­van­taged stu­dents and their fam­i­lies to link them up with com­mu­nity pro­grammes and re­sources, in­clud­ing so­cial work­ers and so­cial ser­vice</p>
    <p>agen­cies, he added.</p>
    <p>The Govern­ment, Dr Ma­liki said, will con­tinue to strengthen such part­ner­ships across dif­fer­ent agen­cies and the com­mu­nity so that it can con­tinue to pro­vide sup­port for dis­ad­van­taged fam­i­lies.</p>
    <p>He added that it is un­der­stand­able some fam­i­lies are un­able to tackle long-term is­sues like ed­u­ca­tion, up­skilling and fi­nan­cial plan­ning as they usu­ally live from pay cheque to pay cheque and would rather fo­cus on more immediate con­cerns. He was con­cerned about such fam­i­lies, and called on the com­mu­nity to come to­gether to im­prove the cir­cum­stances of these fam­i­lies.</p>
    <p>He said: “If we rally to­gether as a com­mu­nity, we can help re­lieve some of these pres­sures for fel­low mem­bers of our com­mu­nity and cit­i­zens – to sta­bilise them and work to­gether to chart a brighter fu­ture for their chil­dren.”</p>
