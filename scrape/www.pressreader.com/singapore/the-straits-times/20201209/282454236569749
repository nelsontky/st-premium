    <p>With 2,480 Keppel Club mem­bers choos­ing to pay the $5,350 top-up fee to ex­tend their mem­ber­ship, the club is one step closer to gain­ing a new home.</p>
    <p>In Oc­to­ber, it was an­nounced that Keppel, whose lease at Bukit Cher­min ex­pires on Dec 31 next year, had been of­fered the chance to op­er­ate Sin­ga­pore Is­land Coun­try Club’s (SICC) Sime Course from Jan 1, 2022, to Dec 31, 2030.</p>
    <p>One ob­sta­cle was Keppel’s lack of funds. Its es­ti­mated $25 mil­lion in re­serves was in­suf­fi­cient to cover the pro­jected $31 mil­lion re­quired for the cap­i­tal out­lay of the new land lease, club­house, recre­ational fa­cil­i­ties and Sime Course.</p>
    <p>To raise the $7 mil­lion to $10 mil­lion needed, Keppel had set a tar­get of get­ting 1,500 of its roughly 5,000 mem­bers to sign up for the top-up scheme by Nov 21.</p>
    <p>Keppel and SICC have also since signed a mem­o­ran­dum of agree­ment and Keppel told The Straits Times both clubs will firm up the ar­range­ment with the rel­e­vant agen­cies in the next few months.</p>
    <p>Keppel, which had re­duced its monthly sub­scrip­tion of around $105 to a nom­i­nal $1 in April, will re­store the full fee from next month.</p>
    <p>The club said this will in­crease by be­tween 20 per cent and 25 per cent in 2022 to meet the higher ex­pected costs of run­ning Sime, as well as Keppel’s pro­posed col­lab­o­ra­tion with the Sin­ga­pore Polytech­nic Grad­u­ates’ Guild (SPGG). The agree­ment al­lows Keppel mem­bers ac­cess to SPGG fa­cil­i­ties.</p>
    <p>Fi­nan­cial con­sul­tant Khor Chee Kok, 58, has been a mem­ber since 1993 and plays two to three times a week. He said: “We will def­i­nitely get slots, it’s just how of­ten we will get to play. But ul­ti­mately, it’s a good deal and op­por­tu­nity.”</p>
    <p>Ms Cheng, who de­clined to give her full name, joined Keppel in 1986 and plays three to four times a week. The free­lance florist, 61, said: “If I have to buy a new mem­ber­ship at an­other club, it would be very ex­pen­sive. I’m old al­ready, the most I can play is an­other 10 years. After that I won’t have en­ergy to play any more.”</p>
    <p>As part of the con­di­tions laid out by the Gov­ern­ment, Keppel will op­er­ate the 18-hole Sime Course at Lornie Road as a hy­brid mem­ber­spub­lic fa­cil­ity. Forty per cent of golf flights will be re­served for Keppel mem­bers and the rest open to the pub­lic. There is a vari­able 10 per cent that can be opened to Keppel mem­bers and the pub­lic on a first come, first served ba­sis.</p>
    <p>Cur­rently, Ma­rina Bay Golf Course (MBGC) is the coun­try’s only pub­lic 18-hole course. Its lease ends in July 2024. The venue is op­er­ated by NCI Golf, a sub­sidiary of the Na­tional Trades Union Congress. The union had been ex­pected to take over the Sime Course and en­sure con­tin­ued pub­lic ac­cess to golf fa­cil­i­ties but pulled out due to high costs.</p>
    <p>Once it takes over, Keppel’s ren­o­va­tion plans for Sime in­clude big­ger tee boxes, im­proved greens, and up­grad­ing the drainage of the course. It plans to op­er­ate the ex­ist­ing cafe­te­ria and out­source the op­er­a­tions of the cur­rent Ja­panese restau­rant for rental in­come.</p>
    <p>The new Sime Course will also be buggy op­er­ated. Ca­ter­ing for walkin flights is be­ing dis­cussed.</p>
    <p>Green fees for the pub­lic at Sime will be sim­i­lar to those at MBGC, which starts from $75 (18 holes on week­days) or $120 (week­ends) for Sin­ga­pore­ans.</p>
    <p>Keppel said it will in­vest in tech­nol­ogy to help digi­tise its op­er­a­tions. The club added it is “well-po­si­tioned to op­er­ate the pub­lic golf course given our ex­per­tise and long proven track record and ex­pe­ri­ence man­ag­ing a golf club and golf course”.</p>
    <p>If I have to buy a new mem­ber­ship at an­other club, it would be very ex­pen­sive. I’m old al­ready, the most I can play is an­other 10 years. After that I won’t have en­ergy to play any more.</p>
