    <p>Nanyang Tech­no­log­i­cal Univer­sity (NTU) yes­ter­day con­firmed that a for­mer em­ployee was on cam­pus while in­fec­tious with Covid-19.</p>
    <p>On Tues­day, the Min­istry of Health (MOH) added three lo­ca­tions in the univer­sity to a list of places vis­ited by coro­n­avirus pa­tients.</p>
    <p>They were: Quad Cafe at NTU’s School of Bi­o­log­i­cal Sci­ences, Korean eatery Paik’s Bibim at NTU’s North Spine Plaza, and the North Spine Food Court.</p>
    <p>In an ad­vi­sory sent to stu­dents yes­ter­day, NTU said the for­mer em­ployee’s last work­ing day was Aug 28, and he had not been on cam­pus since.</p>
    <p>He was not a mem­ber of the teach­ing staff, and did not show any symp­toms while on cam­pus and af­ter he tested pos­i­tive for the virus.</p>
    <p>The univer­sity said he was swabbed when he landed at a for­eign air­port on Sept 1, and he in­formed NTU of his in­fec­tion last Fri­day. It added that he did not know when or where he was ex­posed to the virus.</p>
    <p>“We thank the for­mer em­ployee for in­form­ing us of his test re­sults, and we wish him a speedy re­cov­ery,” said the univer­sity.</p>
    <p>NTU has worked with MOH to is­sue quar­an­tine or­ders to all his close con­tacts.</p>
    <p>“As a pre­cau­tion­ary mea­sure, we have car­ried out deep clean­ing at the for­mer em­ployee’s work ar­eas,” it added. “We have also stepped up clean­ing of the af­fected com­mon lo­ca­tions.”</p>
    <p>MOH yes­ter­day also an­nounced 75 new coro­n­avirus cases.</p>
    <p>Among them was a sole pa­tient from the com­mu­nity. The 33-yearold Bangladesh­i man, a work per­mit holder, was linked to a clus­ter at the Kenyon/UBS con­struc­tion site in the Dhoby Ghaut area.</p>
    <p>He was de­tected as a re­sult of ros­tered rou­tine test­ing of work­ers in the con­struc­tion, marine and</p>
    <p>process sec­tors who live out­side dor­mi­to­ries, even though he did not show symp­toms.</p>
    <p>Four­teen im­ported cases were also an­nounced yes­ter­day. They were placed on 14-day stay-home no­tice upon ar­rival here.</p>
    <p>Two of them are Sin­ga­pore­ans – a six-year-old boy and a 79-year-old man who ar­rived from In­dia.</p>
    <p>Mi­grant work­ers liv­ing in dormi</p>
    <p>tories made up the re­main­ing 60 new coro­n­avirus pa­tients an­nounced yes­ter­day, tak­ing Sin­ga­pore’s to­tal to 57,166.</p>
    <p>Of the 60 new dorm cases, 31 are from Westlite Toh Guan dor­mi­tory.</p>
    <p>The av­er­age num­ber of new daily cases in the com­mu­nity in a week has de­creased from three cases two weeks ago to two in the past week.</p>
    <p>The num­ber of un­linked cases in the com­mu­nity in a week has also de­creased from a daily av­er­age of two cases to one over the same pe­riod.</p>
