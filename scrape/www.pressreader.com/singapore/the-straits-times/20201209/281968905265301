    <p>The busk­ing com­mu­nity must be elated that con­crete steps have fi­nally been taken to al­low its mem­bers back on the streets to per­form safely for a live crowd (Busk­ing pi­lot scheme kicks off with 80 ap­pli­ca­tions for 12 slots, Dec 6).</p>
    <p>I was at *Scape last Satur­day and was, how­ever, dis­ap­pointed to see that the tra­di­tional way of drop­ping cash as gra­tu­ities for the per­form­ers has been re­placed by QR code-scan­ning.</p>
    <p>While this con­tact­less way of trans­ac­tion may en­sure min­i­mal risk of spread­ing in­fec­tion, there are dou­ble stan­dards at play as cash pay­ment is car­ried out freely ev­ery­where else.</p>
    <p>Be­sides, and more no­tably, drop­ping to­kens into hats is very much a fea­ture of busk­ing. Erad­i­cat­ing this el­e­ment is equiv­a­lent to dis­card­ing a big chunk of busk­ing cul­ture.</p>
    <p>Un­til and un­less Sin­ga­pore goes com­pletely cash­less, this tra­di­tional prac­tice should be kept.</p>
    <p>I have also ob­served over the years that young chil­dren gen­er­ally make up the bulk of au­di­ences, es­pe­cially for cir­cus-act shows. They do not carry phones, but are al­ways the most ex­cited to drop money into hats.</p>
    <p>I of­ten saw a lot of them nudg­ing and plead­ing with their par­ents to spare some cash to show their ap­pre­ci­a­tion to buskers.</p>
    <p>To take away the act of drop­ping cash in hats is to de­prive these chil­dren from tak­ing part in busk­ing in their own lit­tle ways. It takes away the fun for chil­dren, to say the least.</p>
    <p>So please, let the buskers lay out their hats.</p>
