    <p>“I can’t be­lieve we ac­tu­ally made it here,” I say, ad­mir­ing the 9pm sun­set in Bel­grade.</p>
    <p>Ear­lier this month, my l ongdis­tance Swedish boyfriend David and I signed a one-month lease for an apart­ment in the Ser­bian cap­i­tal.</p>
    <p>For the first time in my years of travel, I have packed reg­u­lar-sized toi­letries and cook­ing uten­sils. I have no idea how long I will be away.</p>
    <p>We are thank­ful that we can both work re­motely – I edit trail­ers for TV chan­nels while David is an IT con­sul­tant.</p>
    <p>On March 13, I left Stock­holm after vis­it­ing him for three weeks. Our plan was for David to travel to Sin­ga­pore a fort­night later.</p>
    <p>But ev­ery­thing changed as the coron­avirus pan­demic raged across bor­ders, which slammed shut one by one. Sin­ga­pore’s bor­der closed less than a week before his sched­uled ar­rival.</p>
    <p>We scram­bled to find a country where we could ride out the virus, but we were too late. All we could do was wait. And that is what we did for four months, pa­tiently hop­ing that Europe would open up by sum­mer.</p>
    <p>When the list of 14 coun­tries that were al­lowed back in Europe was re­leased on July 1, it did not in­clude Sin­ga­pore. Nei­ther did it seem likely that Sin­ga­pore would al­low for­eign trav­ellers back i n for a while, at least not for Swedish cit­i­zens.</p>
    <p>We scram­bled again, this time to find a third country where we could re­unite. It turned out to be Ser­bia, our sin­gu­lar bea­con of hope.</p>
    <p>We turned to our fa­thers for advice. Both urged us to go, with my dad even telling me not to rush back. As ter­ri­fied as he was of the virus (he has re­fused to trim his manic mane at the bar­ber un­til there are three con­tin­u­ous days of zero in­fec­tion in Sin­ga­pore), he un­der­stood why I had to go.</p>
    <p>The night before I told my par­ents, I was sleep­less. David, how­ever, knew of my par­ents’ epic ro­mance so he was sure they would be sup­port­ive.</p>
    <p>After my mother met my fa­ther when she was 15, they had to over­come K-drama-wor­thy ob­sta­cles which in­cluded my grand­mother “kid­nap­ping” my mother to Hong Kong for three years to for­get my dad, who was then a 19-year-old gang­ster.</p>
    <p>My late grand­fa­ther tried to dis­suade my fa­ther first with money and then later, with threats and vi­o­lence.</p>
    <p>It was a huge re­lief when my par­ents were sup­port­ive, de­spite the prospect of me hav­ing to serve stay-home no­tice when I re­turn and pay­ing hos­pi­tal fees if I am in­fected. My par­ents, David and I were ready for such reper­cus­sions.</p>
    <p>This was not a hol­i­day after all. It was a mis­sion to be to­gether.</p>
    <p>It was a near mir­a­cle that we had fi­nally found a fea­si­ble way to meet when al­most the whole world was on pause mode. But this worm­hole of pos­si­bil­ity was clos­ing by the minute.</p>
    <p>On July 3, we firmed up our plans to meet in Bel­grade five days later, book­ing the tick­ets first and de­cid­ing on the ho­tel only a day before my flight, which was hours before his.</p>
    <p>July 8 was the only day our flights would match and we would meet in the air­port after more than 120 days of be­ing apart.</p>
    <p>The day of my flight ar­rived and I woke up feel­ing fren­zied. True enough, six hours before my flight, I re­ceived bad news. “Your flight has been can­celled,” the Qatar Air­ways agent an­nounced over the phone.</p>
    <p>My gut had been right. “M’am, do</p>
    <p>I book you for another flight two days later?” From the cor­ner of my eye, I saw my strapped-up lug­gage ma­rooned at my door.</p>
    <p>I stalled for time with the agent, my mind rac­ing through all the pos­si­bil­i­ties and my fin­gers shoot­ing tiny bul­lets of pan­icked text to David, writ­ing in caps at 100 words a minute.</p>
    <p>We fi­nally de­cided to go ahead with my re­book­ing. An hour later, Ser­bian Pres­i­dent Alek­san­dar Vu­cic an­nounced a week­end cur­few to con­tain the surg­ing cases of in­fec­tion.</p>
    <p>I could not be­lieve what I was hear­ing. Was my can­celled flight due to the es­ca­la­tion of events in Bel­grade? Ser­bians stormed the Par­lia­ment, livid at the gov­ern­ment’s flawed re­sponse to the pan­demic which has just re­sulted in a sec­ond wave of in­fec­tions, as we gauged our op­tions that end­less night.</p>
    <p>Worst-case sce­nar­ios flashed by. What if the bor­der closed dur­ing my tran­sit in Doha? Or when I ar­rived in Ser­bia? There would be no flights out for me.</p>
    <p>If David went ahead of me, he might be trapped there. Be­ing in Ser­bia would limit the other places that would open up for us to meet in the near fu­ture, per­haps.</p>
    <p>We had to de­cide on his way to the air­port. Do we move his flight to match mine on Fri­day and see how it will go in Ser­bia? Or go now?</p>
    <p>Twenty min­utes before he reached the air­port, we de­cided he should make a dash for it, em­bold­ened by my dad’s ap­proval when I asked for his opin­ion. “Go,” my dad said. “I don’t see what could hap­pen. As long as you can leave the air­port, you will fig­ure ev­ery­thing out.”</p>
    <p>My mother, who is the less ad­ven­tur­ous par­ent of the two, might have been ner­vous, but she never showed it. In­stead, both of them gave me wings.</p>
    <p>David’s flight on a Wed­nes­day, now two days before mine, went smoothly and he breezed past im­mi­gra­tion. By the time it was my turn on Fri­day, ev­ery­thing felt more nor­mal.</p>
    <p>But to my hor­ror, when I checked, I found that my flight was can­celled. Would it be in­sane to say that I was also half-ex­pect­ing it? The world seemed adamant to keep us in place.</p>
    <p>After half an hour on the helpline with Qatar, the air­line agent fi­nally found my re­vised book­ing and put in my new flights. It was my third elec­tronic ticket in three days.</p>
    <p>I reached the air­port in record time, turn­ing up more than three hours before the flight, just in case.</p>
    <p>It was a grave mo­ment, en­ter­ing a hol­low ver­sion of my favourite place in the world, Changi Air­port. De­spite the empty halls, check­ing in took longer than usual.</p>
    <p>One of the staff dashed into a cor­ner to con­fer with her col­leagues. What now, uni­verse? I in­ter­rupted their fer­vent dis­cus­sion after a few min­utes, ask­ing if I could help.</p>
    <p>“Oh no, we just saw a com­ment on your flight to Bel­grade that it has been can­celled and we are check­ing to see who wrote it.”</p>
    <p>Min­utes felt like hours before they con­firmed that the flight would pro­ceed. “Are you sure?” I pleaded twice. I was col­lect­ing as much reassuranc­e as I could.</p>
    <p>All I wanted was to get on a plane, a sim­ple act we have taken so much for granted un­til re­cently.</p>
    <p>I headed for the de­par­ture gates where I found my­self to be the only trav­eller. The usual bustling Ter­mi­nal One was a ghost town, with one or two dis­tant fig­ures drift­ing in and out of the shad­ows. The halls were half-lit. Only a cou­ple of restau­rants, out of the usual 20, were open.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing my solemn 10-minute walk past shut­tered shops, I thought about the dozens of times I had passed through the same halls that once buzzed with crowds per­ma­nently i n good spir­its, steps</p>
    <p>away from planes packed with prom­ises of par­adise. Now it was a cav­ern of stolen dreams.</p>
    <p>That night, there were only three flights leav­ing Sin­ga­pore, in­clud­ing mine. As I worked on my lap­top wait­ing to board, I saw that I was now the only per­son, in the mid­dle of a tun­nel ta­per­ing into dark­ness.</p>
    <p>The time for boarding ar­rived and I saw that I was not the only pas­sen­ger after all. I would be shar­ing the flight with mostly mi­grant work­ers head­ing home.</p>
    <p>On the flight, air crew decked in full body suits greeted us with se­ri­ous eyes and muf­fled welcomes. Ev­ery pas­sen­ger also had to put on both a mask and vi­sor before boarding, which was pro­vided by the air­line. Is this how we will travel from now on?</p>
    <p>I slipped on my socks and gloves, drift­ing into a fit­ful sleep un­der the pro­tec­tive shield of my vi­sor, in a plane that was only half full.</p>
    <p>After a seven-hour flight to Doha, I was shep­herded into a bustling tran­sit hall, where pas­sen­gers decked in var­i­ous lev­els of pro­tec­tion gear cut across one another’s silent paths.</p>
    <p>A few wore full body­suits, while a woman sat on the floor and en­grossed her­self in a fu­ri­ous flurry of texts. Did she also have a wrench thrown into her plans?</p>
    <p>Less than two hours later, I got on my sec­ond flight that would take me to Bel­grade. It was a full flight that would last a lit­tle more than five hours. The ar­rival was an un­event­ful 10-minute stroll through a brisk im­mi­gra­tion queue, like David promised.</p>
    <p>Since May 22, all for­eign trav­ellers to Ser­bia have been ex­empt from any test­ing or quar­an­tine re­quire­ments. I emerged from the ar­rival hall and found David at the exit. We must have been the only for­eign­ers.</p>
    <p>Al­most too ner­vous to hug, we dove i nto the clos­est taxi and headed straight to our ac­com­mo­da­tion. We made it.</p>
    <p>Along the way, I saw a sem­blance of the life we had lost in the last few months in Sin­ga­pore. Peo­ple strolled i n the streets with­out masks, friends gath­ered at outdoor restau­rants and busi­nesses op­er­ated as usual.</p>
    <p>Ser­bia had im­posed a tough lock­down on March 15 and re­sumed pub­lic trans­port only shortly after re­stric­tions were lifted i n early June.</p>
    <p>We ar­rived just before the cusp of a sec­ond wave where there are more than 22,000 con­firmed cases and 508 deaths in the na­tion of seven mil­lion.</p>
    <p>July 22 marked the sev­enth month of our first en­counter in Le­banon last De­cem­ber, where we were both trav­el­ling.</p>
    <p>Book­ended by fiery protests in both Beirut and Bel­grade, with a global health cri­sis brew­ing i n be­tween, it has been a tur­bu­lent few months since our re­la­tion­ship started.</p>
    <p>The other day, I read a CNN story about bi-na­tional cou­ples like us try­ing to re­unite. On Face­book, too, a grow­ing group called Cou­ples Sep­a­rated By Travel Bans has amassed more than 7,000 mem­bers who post des­per­ate plans to meet.</p>
    <p>Daily, on­line ral­lies hash­tagged #loveisesse­n­tial and #loveisnott­ourism stream like tears. These are cou­ples rang­ing from en­gaged col­lege stu­dents to se­niors in their 70s.</p>
    <p>Like them, this is not a hol­i­day for us. We are just a cou­ple, who hap­pen to be from dif­fer­ent coun­tries, try­ing to start a life to­gether.</p>
    <p>A vis­ual sto­ry­teller who was happy not to travel again, Mandy Tay has re­luc­tantly found her­self once again on the road, this time for love.</p>
