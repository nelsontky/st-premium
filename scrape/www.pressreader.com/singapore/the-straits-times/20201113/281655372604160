    <p>Pro­fes­sion­als, man­agers and ex­ec­u­tives (PMEs) will soon be able to learn how to deal with volatil­ity, un­cer­tainty and am­bi­gu­ity in a postCovid-19 world at a new cen­tre set up by the Sin­ga­pore In­sti­tute of Man­age­ment (SIM).</p>
    <p>Those in the so­cial sec­tor will have up to 90 per cent of their course fees sub­sidised.</p>
    <p>The Cen­tre for Sys­tems Lead­er­ship in Bukit Timah, which was launched yes­ter­day by Man­power Min­is­ter Josephine Teo, will also of­fer its pro­grammes on sys­tems think­ing to youth lead­ers and SIM’s fi­nal-year stu­dent lead­ers do­ing their un­der­grad­u­ate stud­ies.</p>
    <p>Sys­tems think­ing is a dis­ci­plined ap­proach for ex­am­in­ing prob­lems in a more holis­tic man­ner be­fore act­ing, al­low­ing users to make in­formed choices.</p>
    <p>Pro­grammes will start from Fe­bru­ary next year, and will range from 30 hours to 18 days long.</p>
    <p>Or­gan­i­sa­tions and busi­nesses in­clud­ing small- and medium-sized en­ter­prises can also have pro­grammes cus­tomised to their needs.</p>
    <p>SIM is plan­ning to set aside $1 mil­lion to fund up to 90 per cent of the pro­gramme fees for the so­cial sec­tor, said pres­i­dent and chief ex­ec­u­tive of­fi­cer Seah Chin Siong dur­ing the launch.</p>
    <p>“We hope this will catal­yse the de­vel­op­ment of crit­i­cal lead­er­ship skills that are nec­es­sary at this time of volatil­ity, un­cer­tainty, com­plex­ity and am­bi­gu­ity,” Mr Seah added.</p>
    <p>The first co­hort of learn­ers will come from the Move­ment for the In­tel­lec­tu­ally Dis­abled of Sin­ga­pore (Minds), Metta Wel­fare As­so­ci­a­tion and Sin­ga­pore Pools, said Mr Seah.</p>
    <p>The cen­tre plans to work with phil­an­thropic or­gan­i­sa­tions such as Te­masek Foun­da­tion as its pro­gramme part­ners, and other in­sti­tu­tions with com­mon goals and ob­jec­tives.</p>
    <p>“In or­der for the cen­tre to be able to im­pact our so­ci­ety, it is im­por­tant that these pro­grammes be made ac­ces­si­ble to as many peo­ple as pos­si­ble,” said Mr Seah.</p>
    <p>Mrs Teo, who of­fi­ci­ated the launch of the cen­tre, was among the se­nior civil ser­vants who were trained in sys­tems think­ing un­der the Sin­ga­pore Civil Ser­vice, one of the ear­li­est adopters of the ap­proach 25 years ago, said SIM.</p>
    <p>Mrs Teo, who is also Sec­ond Min­is­ter for Home Af­fairs, said: “The more com­plex our prob­lems, the more lead­ers need the skill and dis­ci­pline of sys­tems think­ing.”</p>
    <p>“SIM’s launch of the Cen­tre for Sys­tems Lead­er­ship can help to build ca­pac­ity in Sin­ga­pore, not just to emerge stronger from the Covid-19 pan­demic, but also to develop en­dur­ing re­silience against fu­ture dis­rup­tions,” she added.</p>
    <p>Sys­tems think­ing was first pop­u­larised by sys­tems sci­en­tist and man­age­ment guru Peter Senge.</p>
    <p>“Al­though sys­tems think­ing and lead­er­ship gained promi­nence in the 1990s, it is still not widely prac­tised nor recog­nised here for its power to trans­form per­sonal lives and en­ter­prises,” said SIM in a state­ment.</p>
    <p>“With Covid-19 and the chal­leng­ing new nor­mal it brings, there is no more ur­gent time to rein­tro­duce this dis­ci­pline of think­ing and man­ag­ing in com­plex sit­u­a­tions,” it added.</p>
    <p>CRIT­I­CAL SKILLS</p>
    <p>We hope this will catal­yse the de­vel­op­ment of crit­i­cal lead­er­ship skills that are nec­es­sary at this time of volatil­ity, un­cer­tainty, com­plex­ity and am­bi­gu­ity.</p>
    <p>MR SEAH CHIN SIONG, pres­i­dent and chief ex­ec­u­tive of­fi­cer of SIM.</p>
