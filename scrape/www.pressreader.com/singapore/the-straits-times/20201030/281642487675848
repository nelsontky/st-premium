    <p>KUALA LUMPUR • Malaysia’s for­mer prime min­is­ter Ma­hathir Mo­hamad tweeted af­ter a deadly at­tack in Nice yes­ter­day that Mus­lims had a right “to kill mil­lions of French peo­ple”, spark­ing wide­spread anger and prompt­ing Twit­ter to delete his post.</p>
    <p>He made the com­ment in a series of tweets af­ter yes­ter­day’s killing of three peo­ple in a church in France.</p>
    <p>Re­fer­ring to the re­cent be­head­ing of French teacher Sa­muel Paty in Paris, who showed car­i­ca­tures of Prophet Muham­mad in a class on free­dom of ex­pres­sion, Tun Dr Ma­hathir said he did not ap­prove of the at­tack, but free­dom of ex­pres­sion does not in­clude “in­sult­ing other peo­ple”.</p>
    <p>The car­i­ca­tures are seen as blas­phe­mous by Mus­lims.</p>
    <p>“Ir­re­spec­tive of the re­li­gion pro­fessed, an­gry peo­ple kill,” he said.</p>
    <p>“The French in the course of their his­tory have killed mil­lions of peo­ple. Many were Mus­lims. Mus­lims have a right to be an­gry and to kill mil­lions of French peo­ple for the mas­sacres of the past.”</p>
    <p>But he added that “by and large, the Mus­lims have not ap­plied the ‘eye for an eye’ law. Mus­lims don’t. The French shouldn’t”.</p>
    <p>He said French Pres­i­dent Em­manuel Macron was “not show­ing that he is civilised”.</p>
    <p>“The French should teach their peo­ple to re­spect other peo­ple’s feel­ings. Since you have blamed all Mus­lims and the Mus­lims’ re­li­gion for what was done by one an­gry per­son, the Mus­lims have a right to pun­ish the French,” he said.</p>
    <p>He made no di­rect ref­er­ence to the Nice at­tack.</p>
    <p>His com­ments sparked wide­spread con­dem­na­tion, with so­cial me­dia users la­belling them “ou­tra­geous” and “dis­grace­ful”.</p>
    <p>Twit­ter ini­tially flagged his tweet about killing “mil­lions of French peo­ple” as “glo­ri­fy­ing vi­o­lence” but did not re­move it.</p>
    <p>But shortly af­ter­wards, the tweet was deleted en­tirely.</p>
    <p>The be­head­ing of Mr Paty prompted Mr Macron to prom­ise a crack­down on Is­lamic ex­trem­ism. But the move has in­flamed ten­sions, with protests against France erupt­ing in sev­eral Mus­lim coun­tries, and some urg­ing a boy­cott of French goods.</p>
