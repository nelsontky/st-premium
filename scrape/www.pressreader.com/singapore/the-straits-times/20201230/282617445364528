    <p>LONDON • Ac­claimed Chi­nese pian­ist Fou Ts’ong died on Mon­day from Covid-19 at the age of 86.</p>
    <p>Fou was bat­tling the dis­ease in the United King­dom, ac­cord­ing to his stu­dent Kong Jian­ing, a pro­fes­sor at the Royal Col­lege of Mu­sic. He re­vealed that Fou had been in hospi­tal for two weeks.</p>
    <p>One of the first Chi­nese soloists to achieve in­ter­na­tional star­dom, the pian­ist was born in Shang­hai on March 10, 1934. He won the third prize and the spe­cial Mazurka Prize at the 1955 In­ter­na­tional Chopin Pi­ano Com­pe­ti­tion in War­saw.</p>
    <p>He left China on a schol­ar­ship that same year and did not re­turn to the coun­try un­til 1979, when the Cul­tural Rev­o­lu­tion ended.</p>
    <p>In the sub­se­quent decades, he vis­ited China fre­quently for lec­tures and per­for­mances and was ap­pointed an ad­junct pro­fes­sor in the pi­ano de­part­ment of the Bei­jing Cen­tral Con­ser­va­tory of Mu­sic in De­cem­ber 1982.</p>
    <p>His fa­ther Fu Lei was a prom­i­nent writer and trans­la­tor.</p>
    <p>Since set­tling in London in 1958, Fou had per­formed through­out the world, earn­ing him­self the ti­tle of “Pi­ano Poet”.</p>
    <p>He died in London, ac­cord­ing to an an­nounce­ment by the Alink</p>
    <p>Arg­erich Foun­da­tion. The in­de­pen­dent clas­si­cal mu­si­cal plat­form was co-founded by Fou’s friend, pian­ist Martha Arg­erich.</p>
    <p>The state­ment said: “We will al­ways re­mem­ber him as a great mu­si­cian with a great per­son­al­ity.”</p>
    <p>Famed Chi­nese pi­anists such as Lang Lang and Li Yundi also paid trib­ute to the pi­ano great, who was revered for his in­ter­pre­ta­tion of Chopin.</p>
    <p>Lang called Fou “the master and the great artist I tremen­dously re­spect”, while Li said: “May eter­nal and beau­ti­ful mu­sic ac­com­pany you for­ever in heaven and you will not feel lonely.”</p>
    <p>Fou was mar­ried thrice. From 1960 to 1969, he was mar­ried to Zamira Menuhin, the daugh­ter of Amer­i­can-born vi­o­lin­ist Ye­hudi Menuhin. They have one son.</p>
    <p>In the 1970s, he mar­ried Hi­jong Hyun, a daugh­ter of South Korea’s</p>
    <p>Am­bas­sador to Morocco.</p>
    <p>His third wife, Patsy Toh, is a China-born, London-based pian­ist.</p>
    <p>Toh also had Covid-19 and was hos­pi­talised. But she was able to re­turn home be­fore Fou died.</p>
