    <p>TEHERAN • Ira­nian dis­si­dent jour­nal­ist Ruhol­lah Zam, who was con­victed of fo­ment­ing vi­o­lence dur­ing the 2017 anti-gov­ern­ment protests, was ex­e­cuted yes­ter­day, Iran’s state tele­vi­sion re­ported.</p>
    <p>Iran’s Supreme Court on Tues­day up­held the death sen­tence of Zam, who was cap­tured last year af­ter years in ex­ile. His Amad­news feed had more than one mil­lion fol­low­ers.</p>
    <p>State broad­caster Seda va Sima said yes­ter­day that Zam, “di­rec­tor of the counter-rev­o­lu­tion­ary Amad­news net­work, was hanged this morn­ing”.</p>
    <p>France and hu­man rights groups had con­demned the Supreme Court’s de­ci­sion. Zam, who was the son of a pro-re­form Shi’ite cleric, fled Iran and was given asy­lum in France.</p>
    <p>In Oc­to­ber last year, Iran’s Rev­o­lu­tion­ary Guard Corps said it had trapped Zam in a “com­plex oper­a­tion us­ing in­tel­li­gence de­cep­tion”. It did not say where this took place.</p>
    <p>Ira­nian of­fi­cials have ac­cused the US as well as Teheran’s re­gional ri­val Saudi Ara­bia and gov­ern­ment op­po­nents liv­ing in ex­ile of stok­ing the un­rest, which be­gan in late 2017 as re­gional protests over eco­nomic hard­ship spread na­tion­wide.</p>
    <p>Of­fi­cials said 21 peo­ple were killed dur­ing that pe­riod and thou­sands ar­rested. The un­rest was among the worst Iran had seen in decades, and was fol­lowed by even dead­lier protests last year against fuel price rises.</p>
    <p>Zam’s Amad­news feed was sus­pended by mes­sag­ing ser­vice Tele­gram in 2018 for al­legedly in­cit­ing vi­o­lence but later reap­peared un­der an­other name.</p>
