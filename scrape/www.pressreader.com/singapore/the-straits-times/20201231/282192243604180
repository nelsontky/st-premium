    <p>OneSer­vice has been touted as a con­ve­nient one-stop ser­vice to re­port mu­nic­i­pal is­sues.</p>
    <p>But there seems to be a fo­cus on quickly clos­ing a re­ported case to achieve a high rate of “clo­sure”, while the un­der­ly­ing prob­lem is not ac­tu­ally solved.</p>
    <p>I first used OneSer­vice to lodge a com­plaint with the Hous­ing Board on Nov 23, about how my up­stairs neigh­bour’s air-con­di­tion­ing unit was leak­ing due to cor­ro­sion. I had spo­ken to her on mul­ti­ple oc­ca­sions, but she con­tin­ued to ig­nore the prob­lem.</p>
    <p>Hence, I had no choice but to re­fer the is­sue to HDB to­gether with pho­tos of the vis­i­ble cor­ro­sion.</p>
    <p>HDB sent me an e-mail on</p>
    <p>Nov 27 to say that it was look­ing into the case.</p>
    <p>On Dec 1, it sent a let­ter to my neigh­bour, with a copy sent to me, telling her to re­pair the air-con­di­tion­ing unit by Dec 15 and to stop us­ing it un­til the prob­lem was rec­ti­fied.</p>
    <p>On Dec 10, metal­lic pieces of her air-con­di­tion­ing unit started drop­ping onto my air-con­di­tion­ing unit.</p>
    <p>I took more pho­tos and lodged a sec­ond re­port on Dec 12, as I was afraid that the unit might drop onto pedes­tri­ans walk­ing be­low.</p>
    <p>On Dec 15, the sec­ond case was marked as “closed” on OneSer­vice, with the re­marks that my neigh­bour had been ad­vised to re­pair the unit quickly.</p>
    <p>An HDB of­fi­cer also called me to as­sure me that it would send some­body down to look into the is­sue.</p>
    <p>There has been no fol­low-up since then, while the air-con­di­tion­ing unit has con­tin­ued to leak and shed de­bris, and the cor­ro­sion has vis­i­bly wors­ened due to daily use of the unit.</p>
    <p>Per­haps OneSer­vice can look into en­sur­ing that cases are closed only when the prob­lems raised are ac­tu­ally re­solved.</p>
