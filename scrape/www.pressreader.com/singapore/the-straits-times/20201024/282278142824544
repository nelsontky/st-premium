    <p>Core con­sumer prices fell marginally last month, but the de­cline is eas­ing, ac­cord­ing to data re­leased by the Mone­tary Au­thor­ity of Sin­ga­pore (MAS) and the Min­istry of Trade and In­dus­try (MTI) yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Core in­fla­tion, which ex­cludes ac­com­mo­da­tion and pri­vate road trans­port costs, came in at mi­nus 0.1 per cent last month, up from neg­a­tive 0.3 per cent the pre­vi­ous month, due mainly to smaller drops in the costs of ser­vices and elec­tric­ity and gas.</p>
    <p>It was the eighth straight month of core con­sumer prices fall­ing be­low those of the same pe­riod a year ago, but an im­prove­ment from Au­gust’s in­fla­tion figures.</p>
    <p>Over­all in­fla­tion was flat at 0 per cent, up from mi­nus 0.4 per cent in Au­gust, largely due to a more grad­ual de­crease in pri­vate trans­port costs.</p>
    <p>MAS last week up­graded its 2020 fore­cast range for both core and over­all in­fla­tion to mi­nus 0.5 per cent to 0 per cent. Its pre­vi­ous fore­casts for both were mi­nus 1 per cent to 0 per cent.</p>
    <p>It fore­cast core in­fla­tion to turn pos­i­tive next year, at 0 per cent to 1 per cent, while over­all in­fla­tion is ex­pected to be be­tween mi­nus 0.5 per cent and 0.5 per cent.</p>
    <p>The in­fla­tion data showed that pri­vate trans­port costs reg­is­tered a much smaller de­cline at a year-onyear pace of 0.1 per cent last month, com­pared with the 2.3 per cent drop in Au­gust, on a larger in­crease in car prices.</p>
    <p>The cost of elec­tric­ity and gas also fell at a slower rate last month, at mi­nus 14.2 per cent com­pared with mi­nus 14.6 per cent in Au­gust, as the take-up of new sub­scrip­tions un­der the Open Elec­tric­ity Mar­ket eased.</p>
    <p>The cost of re­tail and other goods fell at the same rate of mi­nus 1.3 per cent last month. A larger de­cline in the price of cloth­ing and footwear and a fall in the cost of telecom­mu­ni­ca­tion equip­ment were off­set by a larger in­crease in the cost of house­hold durables and a smaller de­cline in the price of per­sonal care prod­ucts.</p>
    <p>Food in­fla­tion was also un­changed from Au­gust at 1.8 per cent last month, as was ac­com­mo­da­tion in­fla­tion at 0.4 per cent as hous­ing rents saw a sim­i­lar pace of in­crease as in Au­gust.</p>
    <p>Ser­vice costs fell at a slower pace of 0.1 per cent last month com­pared with the 0.5 per cent drop the pre­vi­ous month, due to a steeper in­crease in telecom­mu­ni­ca­tion ser­vices fees and a smaller drop in tu­ition and other fees.</p>
    <p>MAS and MTI noted that in the quar­ters ahead, ex­ter­nal in­fla­tion is likely to re­main low amid weak de­mand con­di­tions in key com­mod­ity mar­kets and con­tin­ued neg­a­tive out­put gaps in Sin­ga­pore’s ma­jor trad­ing part­ners.</p>
    <p>“On the do­mes­tic front, cost pres­sures are ex­pected to stay sub­dued. The ac­cu­mu­lated slack in the labour mar­ket will weigh on wages. Nev­er­the­less, core in­fla­tion is fore­cast to turn mildly pos­i­tive in 2021, as the dis­in­fla­tion­ary ef­fects of gov­ern­ment sub­si­dies in­tro­duced this year fade and de­mand for some do­mes­tic ser­vices grad­u­ally picks up,” said MAS and MTI.</p>
    <p>They added that ac­com­mo­da­tion costs are ex­pected to fall, partly due to the de­cline in for­eign em­ploy­ment, while pri­vate trans­port costs should rise mod­estly amid an an­tic­i­pated re­duc­tion in the sup­ply of cer­tifi­cates of en­ti­tle­ment.</p>
    <p>May­bank Kim Eng econ­o­mists Chua Hak Bin and Lee Ju Ye said in­fla­tion might turn mildly pos­i­tive be­fore the end of the year, which is ear­lier than ex­pected, but it will likely re­main muted next year. “Job losses and wage cuts will cap do­mes­tic price pres­sures. Ex­ter­nal in­fla­tion will also stay soft due to weak com­mod­ity prices.”</p>
    <p>Like­wise, Bar­clays Bank econ­o­mist Brian Tan ex­pects core in­fla­tion this month to be pos­i­tive as Sin­ga­pore’s econ­omy con­tin­ues its muted re­cov­ery af­ter the eas­ing of so­cial dis­tanc­ing mea­sures.</p>
    <p>United Over­seas Bank econ­o­mist</p>
    <p>Barn­abas Gan said that while con­sumer prices may stay low for the rest of this year, in­fla­tion from food, com­mu­ni­ca­tions and ve­hi­cle costs could cush­ion the de­fla­tion­ary ef­fects from other clus­ters in the com­ing months.</p>
    <p>He added: “Low oil prices amid an ab­sent tourism-driven de­mand will likely be head­wind driv­ers against any sig­nif­i­cant uptick in in­fla­tion­ary pres­sures.”</p>
