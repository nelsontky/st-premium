    <p>Look­ing to get back into full­time em­ploy­ment in Fe­bru­ary af­ter leav­ing her mar­ket­ing role with a lo­cal bank in 2018 to fo­cus on her fam­ily, Ms Genevieve Gay hardly ex­pected to be still search­ing for a job af­ter six months.</p>
    <p>But the on­set of the Covid-19 pan­demic ear­lier this year dras­ti­cally changed the com­plex­ion of the job mar­ket for the worse.</p>
    <p>“It has been ex­tremely dif­fi­cult be­cause firstly, the kind of roles that (mid-ca­reer pro­fes­sion­als) are look­ing for are far and few be­tween,” said Ms Gay, 47, a sin­gle mother to a 16-year-old son.</p>
    <p>“For a lot of ju­nior roles as well, even if you are will­ing to take a lower pay, com­pa­nies are not will­ing to con­sider you. It can be de­mor­al­is­ing when you can­not land a job or even an in­ter­view.”</p>
    <p>Ms Gay is now look­ing to ac­quire new skills and knowl­edge in ar­ti­fi­cial in­tel­li­gence that she can com­bine with her years of mar­ket­ing ex­pe­ri­ence.</p>
    <p>She is among the first batch of mid-ca­reer pro­fes­sion­als to em­bark on a six-month train­ing course con­ducted by IBM.</p>
    <p>The course is part of IBM’s new i.am-vi­tal­ize pro­gramme, which aims to train about 800 mid-ca­reer pro­fes­sion­als in AI and cy­ber se­cu­rity by the end of next year.</p>
    <p>An­other trainee, 54-yearold Paul Lai, left his job as a sec­ondary school math­e­mat­ics teacher in Jan­uary af­ter 17 years, and has also en­dured a fruit­less job search thus far.</p>
    <p>“I’m hop­ing that the course will be able to help me bridge the skills gap in terms of my em­ploy­a­bil­ity as I al­ready have some prior knowl­edge in the tech­nol­ogy field,” said Mr Lai, who worked in the fi­nan­cial sec­tor as a sys­tems an­a­lyst prior to be­com­ing a teacher.</p>
