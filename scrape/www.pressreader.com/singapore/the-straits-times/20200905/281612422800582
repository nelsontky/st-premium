    <p>The way bus and train fares are cal­cu­lated may be ad­justed to re­flect ex­i­gen­cies like a sus­tained drop in rid­er­ship seen dur­ing the Covid-19 pan­demic.</p>
    <p>This change may see the Net­work Ca­pac­ity Fac­tor (NCF), a mea­sure of rid­er­ship against the net­work ca­pac­ity, re­duced or omit­ted when cal­cu­lat­ing fares next year.</p>
    <p>Mr Richard Mag­nus, chair­man of the Pub­lic Trans­port Coun­cil (PTC), said yes­ter­day that should the NCF be used as it is in the fare for­mula for next year, it could end up be­ing in­ap­pro­pri­ately high in next year’s re­view.</p>
    <p>This would in turn lead to a sharp rise in fares.</p>
    <p>Pub­lic trans­port rid­er­ship plunged by around 75 per cent dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker pe­riod from April to June. But trains and buses have largely been op­er­at­ing at pre-pan­demic fre­quen­cies, even though rid­er­ship now re­mains at just 60 per cent of pre-pan­demic lev­els.</p>
    <p>At a press con­fer­ence to an­nounce the re­sults of this year’s fare re­view ex­er­cise, Mr Mag­nus said the re­view of NCF will be com­pleted be­fore next year’s fare re­view.</p>
    <p>He added that the re­view will take into ac­count the Covid-19 sit­u­a­tion and its ef­fect on de­mand and sup­ply of pub­lic trans­port.</p>
    <p>The NCF was in­tro­duced into the fare for­mula in 2018 to in­clude the costs aris­ing from ex­pand­ing the trans­port net­work. The cur­rent for­mula, in place un­til 2022, also takes into ac­count in­fla­tion and en­ergy prices, among other things.</p>
    <p>Trans­port econ­o­mist Wal­ter Th­e­seira of the Sin­ga­pore Univer­sity of So­cial Sciences said the de­ci­sion to re­view the NCF would pro­tect com­muters from sharp fluc­tu­a­tions in fares.</p>
    <p>On op­tions to re­cal­cu­late the NCF next year, he said one way could be to use a model to pre­dict the ex­pected de­mand for pub­lic trans­port this year had Covid-19 not oc­curred, and use the fig­ure in next year’s fare for­mula.</p>
    <p>“For ex­am­ple, you could look at the changes in the rid­er­ship over the last cou­ple of years, and es­ti­mate how the changes are re­lated to de­mo­graph­ics and other data, and then ex­trap­o­late that to this year.”</p>
    <p>In the longer term, As­so­ciate Pro­fes­sor Th­e­seira said the fare for­mula should be tweaked to con­sider the other cost in­creases faced by op­er­a­tors, such as train­ing costs.</p>
    <p>“The fare struc­ture is an at­tempt to al­low fares to change in tan­dem with un­der­ly­ing costs, but that re­la­tion­ship is not per­fect, es­pe­cially if the cost struc­ture of the op­er­a­tors were to change over time.”</p>
    <p>Mr Melvin Yong, MP and deputy chair­man of the Gov­ern­ment Par­lia­men­tary Committee (GPC) for Trans­port, also said yes­ter­day that there is a need to study how pub­lic trans­port can be fi­nanced in a sus­tain­able man­ner in the long term.</p>
    <p>He said the GPC will work with var­i­ous stake­hold­ers on the is­sue once Sin­ga­pore gets through the cur­rent eco­nomic cri­sis.</p>
    <p>“The sus­tain­abil­ity of our pub­lic trans­port sys­tem is im­por­tant as it di­rectly im­pacts how much we can in­vest in our pub­lic trans­port work­ers and fu­ture mo­bil­ity tech­nolo­gies,” he added.</p>
