    <p>A com­pany is un­der probe af­ter white dis­charge in a river in Sungei Kadut was traced to its fac­tory in the area.</p>
    <p>Na­tional wa­ter agency PUB said yes­ter­day that it de­ployed its quick re­sponse team to Sungei Kadut Way last Satur­day af­ter re­ceiv­ing pub­lic feed­back about the dis­charge flow­ing into a drain that led to Sungei Pang Sua.</p>
    <p>The team traced its source to the com­pany’s fac­tory in Sungei Kadut and it was de­ter­mined to be a non­toxic cement binder.</p>
    <p>“The dis­charge was con­tained and re­moved in two hours, and the canal has been clear since,” the PUB said in a state­ment is­sued jointly with the Na­tional En­vi­ron­ment Agency (NEA).</p>
    <p>It added that the wa­ter­way where the white dis­charge was ob­served leads to the sea and does not flow into the nearby Kranji Reser­voir.</p>
    <p>When The Straits Times vis­ited the site on Sun­day, the white dis­charge was no longer seen.</p>
    <p>Mr Jerome Pang, an oper­a­tions man­ager in a church who takes fre­quent walks in the area, posted pho­tos of the dis­charge on his Face­book page last Satur­day evening.</p>
    <p>De­scrib­ing it as “un­usual”, the 60-year-old said: “It smelled oily, and the wa­ter kept flow­ing, so there was quite a bit of the sub­stance in the stream.”</p>
    <p>With a friend, he fol­lowed the trail of the white liq­uid to its source by lift­ing drain cov­ers along the pave­ment, and was led to the fac­tory in Sungei Kadut Way. “The work­ers at the fac­tory were quite puz­zled about it as well,” he said.</p>
    <p>The PUB and NEA said they are in­ves­ti­gat­ing the in­ci­dent and will not hes­i­tate to take nec­es­sary ac­tion against the com­pany re­spon­si­ble for the dis­charge.</p>
    <p>If found guilty, the com­pany may be fined up to a max­i­mum of $20,000 un­der the En­vi­ron­men­tal Pro­tec­tion and Man­age­ment Act.</p>
