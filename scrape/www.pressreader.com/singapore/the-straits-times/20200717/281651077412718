    <p>There have not been any cases of re­in­fec­tion among re­cov­ered Covid-19 pa­tients in Sin­ga­pore, the Na­tional Cen­tre for In­fec­tious Diseases (NCID) said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>And while there have been sev­eral re­ports from abroad about the pro­gres­sive de­cline in the level of an­ti­bod­ies in re­cov­ered pa­tients, these need to be eval­u­ated fur­ther.</p>
    <p>An­ti­bod­ies in the hu­man im­mune sys­tem help the body fight the in­vad­ing coro­n­avirus.</p>
    <p>Pro­fes­sor Leo Yee Sin, the NCID ex­ec­u­tive di­rec­tor, told The Straits</p>
    <p>Times yes­ter­day that “the sig­nif­i­cance of these re­ports and clin­i­cal im­pli­ca­tions re­main ar­eas to be stud­ied fur­ther”.</p>
    <p>The Star news­pa­per re­ported on Tues­day that a study in Malaysia had shown that an­ti­body lev­els in pa­tients had de­creased sharply three months af­ter they re­cov­ered.</p>
    <p>This raises ques­tions about re­in­fec­tion and the ef­fec­tive­ness of a po­ten­tial vac­cine, the re­port said.</p>
    <p>It also quoted Malaysia’s di­rec­tor­gen­eral for health, Dr Noor Hisham Ab­dul­lah, as say­ing that if the an­ti­bod­ies are not per­ma­nent, herd im­mu­nity can­not be ac­quired.</p>
    <p>The body pro­duces many dif­fer­ent types of an­ti­bod­ies to fight the pathogen dur­ing an in­fec­tion – but not all can neu­tralise the virus.</p>
    <p>This is the role of spe­cial an­ti­bod­ies, known as neu­tral­is­ing an­ti­bod­ies, which can pre­vent the virus from in­fect­ing a pa­tient’s cells.</p>
    <p>When asked whether de­clin­ing an­ti­body lev­els in a re­cov­ered pa­tient could af­fect the ef­fec­tive­ness of a vac­cine, Prof Leo said there are no de­fin­i­tive an­swers as yet and that more stud­ies need to be done.</p>
    <p>A vac­cine works by stim­u­lat­ing the hu­man im­mune sys­tem to mount a pro­tec­tive re­sponse.</p>
    <p>The com­plex hu­man im­mune net­work sub­se­quently helps the body get rid of the virus.</p>
    <p>Pro­fes­sor Ooi Eng Eong, deputy di­rec­tor of the emerg­ing in­fec­tious diseases pro­gramme at Duke-NUS Med­i­cal School, said that an­ti­bod­ies are but one part of the im­mune re­sponse that would pro­tect pa­tients from re­in­fec­tion.</p>
    <p>“Mea­sur­ing only an­ti­bod­ies thus misses the other half of the im­mune re­sponse – those me­di­ated by killer T cells,” said Prof Ooi. “Us­ing an­ti­body lev­els alone to in­fer im­mu­nity could thus be mis­lead­ing.”</p>
    <p>Both an­ti­bod­ies and T cells are im­por­tant el­e­ments of the hu­man im­mune re­sponse against viral in­fec­tions due to their abil­ity to di­rectly tar­get and kill in­fected cells.</p>
    <p>Sep­a­rately, Sin­ga­pore sci­en­tists found in an­other study the pres­ence of virus-spe­cific T cell im­mu­nity in peo­ple who have re­cov­ered from Covid-19 and se­vere acute res­pi­ra­tory syn­drome (Sars), as well as in some healthy study sub­jects who have never been in­fected by ei­ther virus. Covid-19 and Sars are res­pi­ra­tory diseases caused by coro­n­aviruses from the same fam­ily.</p>
    <p>These find­ings sug­gest that in­fec­tion and ex­po­sure to coro­n­aviruses in­duce long-last­ing mem­ory T cells, which could help in the man­age­ment of the cur­rent pan­demic and in vac­cine de­vel­op­ment against Covid-19.</p>
    <p>The study, which in­volved sci­en­tists from Duke-NUS Med­i­cal School, the Na­tional Univer­sity of</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore (NUS) Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine, Sin­ga­pore Gen­eral Hospi­tal and NCID, was pub­lished in the pres­ti­gious sci­en­tific jour­nal Na­ture on Wed­nes­day.</p>
    <p>One of the au­thors in­volved in the study, NUS As­so­ciate Pro­fes­sor Tan Yee Joo, said the re­searchers have ini­ti­ated fol­low-up stud­ies on Covid-19 re­cov­ered pa­tients to de­ter­mine if their im­mu­nity as shown in their T cells per­sists over an ex­tended pe­riod of time.</p>
    <p>She added: “This is very im­por­tant for vac­cine de­vel­op­ment and to an­swer the question about re­in­fec­tion.”</p>
