    <p>SYD­NEY • Aus­tralian states yes­ter­day tight­ened re­stric­tions on move­ment as the au­thor­i­ties strug­gle to con­tain a fresh out­break of Covid-19 in the coun­try’s south­east that has pushed the na­tional tally of cases be­yond 10,000.</p>
    <p>With grow­ing fears of a sec­ond wave of coro­n­avirus in­fec­tions na­tion­ally, two states ex­tended bor­der re­stric­tions and Aus­tralia’s most pop­u­lous state im­posed lim­its on the num­ber of peo­ple al­lowed in large pubs.</p>
    <p>The changes come as scores of new cases were un­cov­ered in Vic­to­ria, the coun­try’s Covid-19 hot spot, de­spite a re­turn to lockdown last week for nearly five mil­lion peo­ple in state cap­i­tal Mel­bourne.</p>
    <p>Ac­tive cases in the state rose to nearly 2,000 af­ter an­other 270 in­fec­tions were de­tected in the past 24 hours, the au­thor­i­ties said, tak­ing Aus­tralia’s to­tal num­ber of cases to about 10,000.</p>
    <p>Aus­tralia’s death toll hit 110 yes­ter­day af­ter two peo­ple in their 80s died from the virus in Vic­to­ria.</p>
    <p>“We haven’t turned the cor­ner yet. I hope to see that this week, but there are no guar­an­tees,” Dr Brett Sutton, Vic­to­ria’s chief med­i­cal of­fi­cer, told reporters in Mel­bourne.</p>
    <p>Aus­tralia avoided the high Covid-19 ca­su­alty num­bers of other na­tions with swift and strict mea­sures, but a spike in com­mu­ni­ty­trans­mit­ted cases in Vic­to­ria and a rise in new cases in New South Wales have wor­ried other states.</p>
    <p>South Aus­tralia can­celled plans to re­open its bor­der with New South Wales next Mon­day, while</p>
    <p>Queens­land in­tro­duced a manda­tory two-week quar­an­tine for peo­ple who have vis­ited two ar­eas in Syd­ney’s western suburbs.</p>
    <p>“Our pri­mary re­spon­si­bil­ity in South Aus­tralia is to the health, safety and wel­fare of all South Aus­tralians,” Premier Steven Mar­shall told reporters in Ade­laide.</p>
    <p>Aus­tralia’s North­ern Ter­ri­tory said it will de­cide to­day whether to al­low any­one from New South Wales to en­ter when its do­mes­tic bor­ders re­open later this week.</p>
    <p>New South Wales, which has seen sev­eral dozen cases linked to the out­break in Vic­to­ria, said pubs will now be lim­ited to no more than 300 peo­ple, re­spond­ing to an out­break cen­tred at a large ho­tel in south-western Syd­ney.</p>
    <p>The au­thor­i­ties be­lieve 600 peo­ple vis­ited the Cross­roads Ho­tel on July 3, when the out­break is be­lieved to have be­gun.</p>
    <p>New South Wales Premier Gla­dys Bere­jik­lian told reporters: “In­door ac­tiv­ity, where peo­ple aren’t seated, is a huge health risk. It in­creases the chance of trans­mis­sion.”</p>
