    <p>TAMPA • Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump and Demo­cratic ri­val Joe Bi­den show­cased their con­trast­ing ap­proaches to the resur­gent coro­n­avirus pan­demic as they ral­lied sup­port­ers on Thurs­day in the bat­tle­ground state of Florida, with the clock wind­ing down to elec­tion day.</p>
    <p>Opin­ion polls show Mr Bi­den with a sig­nif­i­cant edge na­tion­ally, but with a tighter lead in the bat­tle­ground states that play a de­ci­sive role in the fi­nal re­sult.</p>
    <p>A Reuters/Ipsos poll re­leased on Wed­nes­day showed Mr Trump had essen­tially moved into a tie with Mr Bi­den in Florida, with 49 per cent say­ing they would vote for Mr Bi­den and 47 per cent for the Pres­i­dent.</p>
    <p>With its 29 elec­toral votes, the state is a ma­jor prize in next Tues­day’s elec­tion. Mr Trump’s vic­tory in Florida in 2016 was vi­tal to his sur­prise elec­tion win.</p>
    <p>Thou­sands of peo­ple, many of them with­out masks, crowded to­gether at an out­door event in Tampa on Thurs­day to hear Mr Trump mock his op­po­nent, the for­mer vice-pres­i­dent. “Could you imag­ine los­ing to this guy? Could you imag­ine?” Mr Trump said.</p>
    <p>The Pres­i­dent also down­played the pan­demic, as he has done through­out the year, telling peo­ple that if they con­tracted the virus, they would “get bet­ter”, just as he did af­ter his own di­ag­no­sis.</p>
    <p>Hours later, Mr Bi­den ar­rived in the same city to hold a “drive-in” rally, where at­ten­dees re­mained in or near their cars to avoid the pos­si­ble spread of the virus, his sec­ond such event of the day in Florida.</p>
    <p>Sup­port­ers at the event wore masks, as re­quired by Mr Bi­den’s cam­paign, al­though they did not al­ways main­tain so­cial dis­tanc­ing.</p>
    <p>He crit­i­cised Mr Trump for hold­ing what he termed a “su­per-spreader event” and at­tacked the Pres­i­dent’s re­peated as­ser­tion that the coun­try had moved past the worst days of the pan­demic, de­spite cases ris­ing na­tion­wide.</p>
    <p>“Don­ald Trump has waved the white flag, aban­doned our fam­i­lies and sur­ren­dered to this virus,” Mr Bi­den said. “But the Amer­i­can peo­ple never give up; we never give in.”</p>
    <p>The pan­demic that has up­ended life across the United States, killed more than 227,000 peo­ple and caused mil­lions of job losses, is roar­ing back.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump has re­peat­edly dis­missed the threat, even as lead­ers in Europe scram­ble to con­tain a sec­ond wave and pub­lic health ex­perts pre­dict a grim win­ter in the US. Of­fi­cials in Gas­to­nia, North Carolina, warned peo­ple who at­tended an Oct 21 Trump rally there that two peo­ple who took part tested pos­i­tive for Covid-19.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump’s White House coro­n­avirus task force is warn­ing of a per­sis­tent and broad spread of Covid-19 in the western half of the coun­try, in­clud­ing in a num­ber of states that will play an im­por­tant role in the elec­tion.</p>
    <p>The Repub­li­can Pres­i­dent hailed fig­ures re­leased on Thurs­day that showed the US econ­omy grew at an un­ri­valled an­nu­alised pace of 33 per cent in the third quar­ter be­cause of a huge fed­eral pan­demic re­lief pro­gramme. “So glad this great GDP num­ber came out be­fore Novem­ber 3rd,” Mr Trump wrote in a tweet.</p>
    <p>It is doubt­ful, how­ever, whether eco­nomic data this close to elec­tion day can in­flu­ence the out­come.</p>
    <p>Mr Bi­den can point out that US out­put re­mains be­low its level in the fourth quar­ter of last year, be­fore the pan­demic hit.</p>
    <p>Fol­low­ing his own bout with Covid-19, the Pres­i­dent has had a hec­tic cam­paign sched­ule, hold­ing as many as three ral­lies a day in dif­fer­ent states, while Mr Bi­den has taken a more mea­sured tack, spend­ing two days this week close to his home base of Delaware.</p>
    <p>More than 80 mil­lion Amer­i­cans have al­ready cast bal­lots in the pres­i­den­tial elec­tion, ac­cord­ing to a tally on Thurs­day from the US Elec­tions Project at the Univer­sity of Florida, set­ting the stage for the high­est par­tic­i­pa­tion rate in over a cen­tury. That surge in­cludes more than 51 mil­lion bal­lots cast by mail, a long­stand­ing prac­tice of Amer­i­can elec­tions that is surg­ing in pop­u­lar­ity be­cause of the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>State of­fi­cials and ex­perts have warned that it may take days or even weeks to tally them as some states have rules that for­bid count­ing early votes be­fore elec­tion day.</p>
    <p>The Pres­i­dent down­played the pan­demic, as he has done through­out the year, telling peo­ple that if they con­tracted the virus, they would “get bet­ter”, just as he did af­ter his own di­ag­no­sis.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump’s White House coro­n­avirus task force is warn­ing of a per­sis­tent and broad spread of Covid-19 in the western half of the United States, in­clud­ing in a num­ber of states that will play an im­por­tant role in the elec­tion.</p>
