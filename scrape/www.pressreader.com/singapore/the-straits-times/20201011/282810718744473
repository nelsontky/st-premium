    <p>The coro­n­avirus pan­demic has sparked a rush for plas­tic.</p>
    <p>From Wuhan to New York, de­mand for face shields, gloves, take­away food con­tain­ers and bub­ble wrap for on­line shop­ping has surged. Since most of these can­not be re­cy­cled, so has the waste.</p>
    <p>But there is another con­se­quence. The pan­demic has in­ten­si­fied a price war be­tween re­cy­cled and new plas­tic, made by the oil in­dus­try. It is a war re­cy­clers world­wide are los­ing, price data and in­ter­views with more than two dozen busi­nesses across five con­ti­nents show.</p>
    <p>“I re­ally see a lot of peo­ple strug­gling,” said Dr Steve Wong, chief ex­ec­u­tive of Hong-Kong based Fuku­tomi Re­cy­cling and chair­man of the China Scrap Plas­tics As­so­ci­a­tion.</p>
    <p>“They don’t see a light at the end of the tun­nel.”</p>
    <p>The rea­son: Nearly ev­ery piece of plas­tic be­gins life as a fos­sil fuel. The eco­nomic slow­down has punc­tured de­mand for oil.</p>
    <p>In turn, that has cut the price of new plas­tic.</p>
    <p>Al­ready, since 1950, the world has cre­ated 6.3 bil­lion tonnes of plas­tic waste, 91 per cent of which has never been re­cy­cled, ac­cord­ing to a 2017 study pub­lished in the jour­nal Science Ad­vances.</p>
    <p>Most is hard to re­cy­cle, and many re­cy­clers have long de­pended on govern­ment sup­port. New plas­tic, known to the in­dus­try as “vir­gin” ma­te­rial, can be half the price of the most com­mon re­cy­cled plas­tic.</p>
    <p>Since Covid-19, even drink bot­tles made of re­cy­cled plas­tic – the most com­monly re­cy­cled plas­tic item – have be­come less vi­able.</p>
    <p>The re­cy­cled plas­tic to make them is 83 per cent to 93 per cent more ex­pen­sive than new bot­tle­grade plas­tic, ac­cord­ing to market an­a­lysts at the In­de­pen­dent Com­mod­ity In­tel­li­gence Ser­vices (ICIS).</p>
    <p>The pan­demic hit as politi­cians in many coun­tries promised to wage war on waste from sin­gle-use plas­tics.</p>
    <p>China, which used to i mport more than half the world’s traded plas­tic waste, banned im­ports of most of it in 2018. The Euro­pean Union plans to ban many sin­gle-use plas­tic items from next year. The United States Se­nate is con­sid­er­ing a ban on sin­gle-use plas­tic and may in­tro­duce le­gal re­cy­cling tar­gets.</p>
    <p>Plas­tic, most of which does not de­com­pose, is a sig­nif­i­cant driver of cli­mate change.</p>
    <p>The man­u­fac­ture of four plas­tic bot­tles alone re­leases the equiv­a­lent green­house gas emis­sions of driv­ing one mile (1.6km) in a car, ac­cord­ing to the World Eco­nomic Fo­rum, based on a study by the drinks in­dus­try.</p>
    <p>The US burns six times more plas­tic than it re­cy­cles, ac­cord­ing to re­search in April last year by Ms Jan Dell, a chem­i­cal engi­neer and for­mer vice-chair of the US Fed­eral cli­mate com­mit­tee.</p>
    <p>But the coro­n­avirus has ac­cen­tu­ated a trend to cre­ate more, not less, plas­tic trash.</p>
    <p>The oil and gas in­dus­try plans to spend around US$400 bil­lion (S$541.7 bil­lion) over the next five years on plants to make raw ma­te­ri­als for vir­gin plas­tic, ac­cord­ing to a study last month by Car­bon Tracker, an en­ergy think-tank.</p>
    <p>This is be­cause, as a grow­ing fleet of elec­tric ve­hi­cles and im­proved en­gine ef­fi­ciency re­duce fuel de­mand, the in­dus­try hopes ris­ing de­mand for new plas­tic can as­sure fu­ture growth in de­mand for oil and gas. It is count­ing on soar­ing use of plas­tic-based con­sumer goods by mil­lions of new mid­dle-class con­sumers in Asia and else­where.</p>
    <p>ExxonMo­bil spokesman Sarah Nordin said: “Over the next few decades, pop­u­la­tion and in­come growth are ex­pected to cre­ate more de­mand for plas­tics, which help sup­port safety, con­ve­nience and im­proved liv­ing stan­dards.”</p>
    <p>Most com­pa­nies say they share con­cerns about plas­tic waste and are sup­port­ing ef­forts to re­duce it. How­ever, their in­vest­ments in these ef­forts are a frac­tion of those go­ing into making new plas­tic, Reuters found.</p>
    <p>Reuters sur­veyed 12 of the largest oil and chem­i­cals firms glob­ally – BASF, Chevron, Dow, Exxon, For­mosa Plas­tics, Ineos, LG Chem, Lyon­del­lBasell, Mit­subishi Chem­i­cal, Sabic, Shell and Sinopec. Only a hand­ful gave de­tails of how much they are in­vest­ing in waste re­duc­tion. Three de­clined to com­ment in de­tail or did not re­spond.</p>
    <p>Most said they chan­nel their ef­forts through a group called the Al­liance to End Plas­tic Waste (AEPW), which is also backed by con­sumer goods com­pa­nies, and which has pledged US$1.5 bil­lion over the next five years on that ef­fort. Its 47 mem­bers, most of whom are in the plas­tics in­dus­try, had combined an­nual rev­enue of al­most US$2.5 tril­lion last year, ac­cord­ing to a Reuters tally of com­pany re­sults.</p>
    <p>In to­tal, com­mit­ments by AEPW and the com­pa­nies sur­veyed amounted to less than US$2 bil­lion over five years, or US$400 mil­lion a year, the sur­vey found. That is a frac­tion of their sales.</p>
    <p>Plans to in­vest so heav­ily in new plas­tic are “quite a con­cern­ing move”, said Ms Lisa Beauvi­lain, head of sus­tain­abil­ity at Im­pax As­set Man­age­ment, a fund with US$18.5 bil­lion un­der man­age­ment.</p>
    <p>“Coun­tries with of­ten un­de­vel­oped waste man­age­ment and re­cy­cling in­fra­struc­ture will be ill equipped to han­dle even larger vol­umes of plas­tic waste,” she said.</p>
    <p>“We are lit­er­ally drown­ing in plas­tics.”</p>
    <p>Since Covid-19 struck, re­cy­clers world­wide told Reuters their busi­nesses have shrunk, by more than 20 per cent in Europe, by 50 per cent in parts of Asia and as much as 60 per cent for some firms in the US.</p>
    <p>Mr Greg Jan­son, whose St Louis, Mis­souri, re­cy­cling com­pany QRS has been in busi­ness for 46 years, says his po­si­tion would have been unimag­in­able a decade ago: The US has be­come one of the cheap­est places to make vir­gin plas­tic, so more is com­ing onto the market.</p>
    <p>“The pan­demic ex­ac­er­bated this tsunami,” he said.</p>
    <p>The oil and chem­i­cals com­pa­nies that were sur­veyed said plas­tic can be part of the so­lu­tion to global chal­lenges re­lated to a grow­ing pop­u­la­tion. Six said they were also de­vel­op­ing new tech­nolo­gies to re­use waste plas­tic.</p>
    <p>Some said other pack­ag­ing prod­ucts can cause more emis­sions than plas­tics; be­cause plas­tic is light, it is in­dis­pens­able to the world’s con­sumers and can help re­duce emis­sions. A few called on gov­ern­ments to im­prove waste man­age­ment in­fra­struc­ture.</p>
    <p>“Higher pro­duc­tion ca­pac­i­ties do not nec­es­sar­ily mean more plas­tic waste pol­lu­tion,” said a spokesman at Ger­many’s BASF, the world’s big­gest chem­i­cals pro­ducer, adding that the com­pany has been in­no­vat­ing for many years in pack­ag­ing ma­te­ri­als to re­duce the re­sources re­quired.</p>
    <p>The new plas­tic wave is break­ing on shores across the globe.</p>
    <p>MAKE PLAS­TIC</p>
    <p>Mr Richard Pon­til­las, 33, runs a fam­ily-owned “sari-sari” or pro­vi­sion shop in Que­zon City, the most pop­u­lous me­trop­o­lis in the Philip­pines.</p>
    <p>The liq­uid goods he sells used to be pack­aged in glass. Many cus­tomers, in fact, brought in their own bot­tles to be re­filled.</p>
    <p>Mer­chants like him are among key tar­gets for the plas­tics in­dus­try, look­ing to ex­tend a trend es­tab­lished af­ter 1907, when Bel­gianAmer­i­can chemist Leo Baeke­land in­vented Bake­lite. Since World War II, mass-pro­duced plas­tic has fu­elled eco­nomic growth and spawned a new era of con­sumerism and con­ve­nience pack­ag­ing.</p>
    <p>“Many years ago... we re­lied on goods repack­aged in bot­tles and plas­tic bags,” said Mr Pon­til­las, whose store sells rice, condi­ments and sa­chets of cof­fee, choco­late drinks and sea­son­ings.</p>
    <p>To­day, thou­sands of small-scale ven­dors in the de­vel­op­ing world stock daily goods in plas­tic pouches, or sa­chets, which hang in strips from the roofs of road­side shacks and cost a few cents a go.</p>
    <p>Al­ready, 164 mil­lion such sa­chets are used ev­ery day in the Philip­pines, ac­cord­ing to the Global Al­liance for In­cin­er­a­tor Al­ter­na­tives, a non-gov­ern­men­tal or­gan­i­sa­tion (NGO).</p>
    <p>That is nearly 60 bil­lion a year. Con­sumer goods firms, in­clud­ing Nes­tle and P&G, say they are work</p>
    <p>ing hard to make their pack­ag­ing ei­ther re­cy­clable or re­us­able.</p>
    <p>For ex­am­ple, P&G said it has a project in schools in the Manila re­gion which aims to col­lect one mil­lion sa­chets for “up­cy­cling”. But sa­chets are very dif­fi­cult to re­cy­cle.</p>
    <p>They are just one form of pol­lu­tion that the pan­demic is adding to, clog­ging drains, pol­lut­ing wa­ter, suf­fo­cat­ing ma­rine life and at­tract­ing ro­dents and dis­ease-car­ry­ing in­sects.</p>
    <p>So are face masks, which are made partly from plas­tic.</p>
    <p>In March, China used 116 mil­lion of them – 12 times more than in Fe­bru­ary, of­fi­cial data shows.</p>
    <p>To­tal pro­duc­tion of masks i n China is ex­pected to ex­ceed 100 bil­lion this year, ac­cord­ing to a re­port by Chi­nese con­sul­tancy iiMe­dia Re­search.</p>
    <p>The US gen­er­ated an en­tire year’s worth of med­i­cal waste in two months at the height of the pan­demic, ac­cord­ing to another con­sul­tancy, Frost & Sul­li­van.</p>
    <p>Even as the waste mounts, much is at stake for the oil in­dus­try.</p>
    <p>Exxon fore­casts that de­mand for petro­chem­i­cals will rise by 4 per cent a year over the next few decades, the com­pany said at an in­vestor pre­sen­ta­tion in March.</p>
    <p>And oil’s share of en­ergy for trans­port will fall from more than 90 per cent in 2018 to just un­der 80 per cent or as low as 20 per cent by 2050, BP said in its an­nual market re­port last month.</p>
    <p>Oil com­pa­nies worry that en­vi­ron­men­tal con­cerns may blunt petro­chem­i­cal growth.</p>
    <p>The United Na­tions said last year that 127 coun­tries have adopted bans or other laws to man­age plas­tic bags.</p>
    <p>BP’s chief economist Spencer Dale said in 2018 that global plas­tic bans could re­sult in two mil­lion bar­rels per day of lower oil de­mand growth by 2040 – around 2 per cent of cur­rent daily de­mand. The com­pany de­clined fur­ther com­ment.</p>
    <p>USE PLAS­TIC</p>
    <p>This year alone, Exxon, Royal Dutch Shell and BASF have an­nounced petro­chem­i­cal plant in­vest­ments in China worth a combined US$25 bil­lion, tap­ping ris­ing de­mand for con­sumer goods in the world’s most pop­u­lous coun­try.</p>
    <p>An ad­di­tional 176 new petro­chem­i­cal plants are planned in the next five years, of which nearly 80 per cent will be in Asia, en­ergy con­sul­tancy Wood Macken­zie says.</p>
    <p>In the US, since 2010, en­ergy com­pa­nies have in­vested more than US$200 bil­lion in 333 plas­tic and other chem­i­cal projects, ac­cord­ing to the Amer­i­can Chem­istry Coun­cil (ACC), an in­dus­try body.</p>
    <p>Those in­vest­ments have come as the US in­dus­try sought to cap­i­talise on a sud­den abun­dance of cheap nat­u­ral gas re­leased by the shale revo­lu­tion.</p>
    <p>The in­dus­try says dis­pos­able plas­tics have saved lives.</p>
    <p>“Sin­gle-use plas­tics have been the dif­fer­ence be­tween life and death dur­ing this pan­demic,” Mr Tony Ra­doszewski, pres­i­dent and chief ex­ec­u­tive of the Plas­tics In­dus­try As­so­ci­a­tion, the in­dus­try’s lob­by­ing group in the US, told Reuters.</p>
    <p>Bags for in­tra­venous so­lu­tions and ven­ti­la­tors re­quire sin­gle-use plas­tics, he said. “Hos­pi­tal gowns, gloves and masks are made from safe, san­i­tary plas­tic.”</p>
    <p>In March, the group wrote to the US Depart­ment of Health and Hu­man Ser­vices, call­ing for a roll­back of plas­tic bag bans on health grounds.</p>
    <p>It said plas­tic bags are safer, be­cause germs live on re­us­able bags and other sub­stances.</p>
    <p>Re­searchers led by the Na­tional In­sti­tute of Al­lergy and In­fec­tious Dis­eases, a US govern­ment agency, found later that month that the coro­n­avirus was still ac­tive on plas­tic af­ter 72 hours, com­pared with up to 24 hours on card­board and cop­per.</p>
    <p>The in­dus­try’s let­ter was part of a long­stand­ing cam­paign for sin­gleuse ma­te­rial.</p>
    <p>The ACC’s manag­ing di­rec­tor for plas­tics Keith Christ­man said the chem­i­cals lobby is op­posed to plas­tic bans be­cause it be­lieves con­sumers would switch to us­ing other dis­pos­able ma­te­ri­als like glass and pa­per, rather than reusing bags and bot­tles.</p>
    <p>“The chal­lenge comes when you ban plas­tic but the al­ter­na­tive might not be a re­us­able prod­uct... so it re­ally wouldn’t ac­com­plish much,” Mr Christ­man said.</p>
    <p>Plas­tic makes up 80 per cent of ma­rine de­bris, ac­cord­ing to the In­ter­na­tional Union for Con­ser­va­tion of Na­ture, a global al­liance backed by gov­ern­ments, NGOs and com­pa­nies in­clud­ing Shell, which is also a mem­ber of the ACC.</p>
    <p>Plas­tic pol­lu­tion has been shown to be deadly to tur­tles, whales and baby seals, and re­leases chem­i­cals that we in­hale, in­gest or touch that cause a wide range of harms, in­clud­ing hor­monal dis­rup­tion and cancer, the UN says.</p>
    <p>RE­CY­CLE?</p>
    <p>Plas­tic re­cy­clers have faced new prob­lems in the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>De­mand for re­cy­cled ma­te­rial from pack­ag­ing busi­nesses fell by 20 per cent to 30 per cent in Europe in the sec­ond quar­ter com­pared with the pre­vi­ous year, ICIS says.</p>
    <p>At the same time, peo­ple who stayed at home cre­ated more re­cy­cling waste, said Ms San­dra Cas­tro, CEO of Ex­tru­plas, a Por­tuguese re­cy­cling firm which trans­forms re­cy­cled plas­tics into out­door furniture.</p>
    <p>“There are many re­cy­cling com­pa­nies that may not be able to cope,” she said. “We need the in­dus­try to be able to pro­vide a so­lu­tion to the waste we pro­duce.”</p>
    <p>In the US, QRS’ Mr Jan­son said that for two months af­ter the pan­demic lock­downs, his or­ders were down 60 per cent and he dropped his prices by 15 per cent.</p>
    <p>And the pan­demic has added to costs for big con­sumer com­pa­nies that use re­cy­cled plas­tic.</p>
    <p>The Coca-Cola Co told Reuters last month it missed a tar­get to get re­cy­cled plas­tic into half its pack­ag­ing in Bri­tain by early this year due to Covid-19 de­lays. The com­pany said it hopes now to meet that by next month.</p>
    <p>Coca-Cola, Nes­tle and Pep­siCo have been the world’s top three plas­tic pol­luters for two years run­ning, ac­cord­ing to a yearly brand au­dit by Break Free From Plas­tic, an NGO.</p>
    <p>These com­pa­nies have for decades made vol­un­tary goals to in­crease re­cy­cled plas­tic in their prod­ucts. They have largely failed to meet them. Coke and Nes­tle said it can be hard to get the plas­tic they need from re­cy­cled sources.</p>
    <p>“We of­ten pay more for re­cy­cled plas­tic than we would if we pur­chased vir­gin plas­tic,” a Nes­tle spokesman said, adding that in­vest­ment in re­cy­cled ma­te­rial was a com­pany pri­or­ity.</p>
    <p>Asked how much they were in­vest­ing i n re­cy­cling and waste clean-up pro­grammes, the three com­pa­nies named ini­tia­tives to­talling US$215 mil­lion over a sev­enyear pe­riod.</p>
    <p>At cur­rent in­vest­ment lev­els in re­cy­cling, brands will not meet their tar­gets, an­a­lysts at ICIS and Wood Macken­zie say.</p>
    <p>Even if ex­ist­ing re­cy­cling pledges are met, the plas­tic go­ing into the oceans is on course to rise from 11 mil­lion tonnes now to 29 mil­lion by 2040, ac­cord­ing to a study pub­lished in June by Pew Trusts, an in­de­pen­dent pub­lic in­ter­est group.</p>
    <p>Cu­mu­la­tively, this would reach 600 mil­lion tonnes – the weight of three mil­lion blue whales.</p>
    <p>In re­sponse to mount­ing pub­lic con­cerns, AEPW says it will part­ner ex­ist­ing small-scale NGOs that clean up waste in de­vel­op­ing coun­tries.</p>
    <p>One ven­ture, which helps women earn money from sell­ing plas­tic scrap in Ghana, says it has suc­cess­fully di­verted 35 tonnes of plas­tic from be­com­ing lit­ter since March 2017.</p>
    <p>That is less than 0.01 per cent of the an­nual plas­tic waste gen­er­ated in Ghana, or 2 per cent of the plas­tic waste that Amer­ica ex­ported to Ghana last year, ac­cord­ing to the World Bank and US trade data.</p>
    <p>“We do re­alise change won’t hap­pen overnight,” said AEPW pres­i­dent and CEO Jacob Duer. “What is im­por­tant for us is that our projects are not seen as the end, but the be­gin­ning.”</p>
    <p>In the Philip­pines, Viet­nam and In­dia, as much as 80 per cent of the re­cy­cling in­dus­try was not op­er­at­ing dur­ing the height of the pan­demic. And there was a 50 per cent drop in de­mand for re­cy­cled plas­tic on av­er­age across South and South­east Asia, ac­cord­ing to Cir­cu­late Cap­i­tal, a Sin­ga­pore-based in­vestor in Asian re­cy­cling op­er­a­tions.</p>
    <p>“The com­bi­na­tion of the im­pact of Covid-19 and low oil prices is like a dou­ble whammy” for plas­tic re­cy­cling, said Cir­cu­late’s CEO Rob Ka­plan. “We’re see­ing mas­sive dis­rup­tion.”</p>
    <p>Even if ex­ist­ing re­cy­cling pledges are met, the plas­tic go­ing into the oceans is on course to rise from 11 mil­lion tonnes now to 29 mil­lion by 2040, ac­cord­ing to a study pub­lished in June by Pew Trusts, an in­de­pen­dent pub­lic in­ter­est group. Cu­mu­la­tively, this would reach 600 mil­lion tonnes – the weight of three mil­lion blue whales.</p>
