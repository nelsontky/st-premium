    <p>I no­tice that this short red gor­geous flower plant (right) has an­other species with a dif­fer­ent type of leaf branch­ing from the main trunk. I ini­tially thought it was just an­other in­de­pen­dent plant with big­ger, pur­plish leaves bud­ding from the ground. But on closer look and after re­mov­ing some soil, I re­alise the two stems were in­deed branches of the main plant. What causes this and what should I do to en­sure the plant is not taken over by a par­a­site? Ng Kheng Bin</p>
    <p>The plant is botan­i­cally known as Camel­lia changii and is a flow­er­ing shrub that pro­duces at­trac­tive red flow­ers. It is sold as a grafted plant where its top por­tion, called a scion, is joined to a suit­able root­stock, which is usu­ally a dif­fer­ent but re­lated plant.</p>
    <p>It is not un­com­mon for the root­stock to have dor­mant buds which may pro­duce new growth.</p>
    <p>The new growth found on the root­stock can be more vig­or­ous and should be re­moved so it does not over­take the growth of the scion.</p>
