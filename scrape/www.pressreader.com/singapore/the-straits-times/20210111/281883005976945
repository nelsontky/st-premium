    <p>•</p>
    <p>NEW YORK Ma­jor tech­nol­ogy com­pa­nies like Google and Mi­crosoft, as well as telecom­mu­ni­ca­tions gi­ants like Com­cast and Ver­i­zon, are among the nearly 1,000 peo­ple and groups that have do­nated at least US$200 (S$265) to the com­mit­tee or­gan­is­ing Pres­i­dent-elect Joe Bi­den’s scaled-back in­au­gu­ra­tion cel­e­bra­tion this month.</p>
    <p>The donor list, re­leased last Satur­day evening by the com­mit­tee, was filled mostly with in­di­vid­ual donors, in­clud­ing ma­jor givers to Democrats such as Atlanta Fal­cons owner Arthur Blank; Mr Richard Blum, the hus­band of Cal­i­for­nia sen­a­tor Dianne Fe­in­stein; and hedge fund mogul Don­ald Suss­man.</p>
    <p>The in­au­gu­ral com­mit­tee did not list any of the amounts that the more than 960 donors had given as at Dec 31, the end of the pe­riod cov­ered in the vol­un­tary dis­clo­sure.</p>
    <p>The ac­tual donor amounts may not be known un­til 90 days after the in­au­gu­ra­tion when the com­mit­tee will be re­quired un­der law to dis­close the names and amounts of all dona­tions over US$200.</p>
    <p>There are no le­gal lim­i­ta­tions on how much a donor can give to an in­au­gu­ral com­mit­tee, but Mr Bi­den’s com­mit­tee vol­un­tar­ily lim­ited con­tri­bu­tions by in­di­vid­u­als to US$500,000 and by cor­po­ra­tions to US$1 mil­lion.</p>
    <p>Many of the ma­jor cor­po­ra­tions that tra­di­tion­ally make large con­tri­bu­tions to in­au­gu­ra­tion events are miss­ing. Some have ex­plained that they are not go­ing to do­nate, given that the event will largely be vir­tual be­cause of the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Oth­ers have said they are fo­cus­ing their dona­tions on help­ing peo</p>
    <p>ple af­fected by the eco­nomic down­turn caused by the coro­n­avirus.</p>
    <p>But the tech and tele­coms in­dus­tries, a ma­jor source of cash for Mr Bi­den’s cam­paign and the groups sup­port­ing it, are well rep­re­sented on the list, with dona­tions also com­ing from Cal­i­for­nia-based semi­con­duc­tor and soft­ware firm Qual­comm and ca­ble com­pany Char­ter Com­mu­ni­ca­tions.</p>
    <p>Google was in­cluded on the list be­cause it pro­vided on­line se­cu­rity pro­tec­tions with­out charge to the in­au­gu­ral com­mit­tee, said the tech gi­ant’s spokesman Jose Cas­taneda.</p>
    <p>Other cor­po­rate dona­tions came</p>
    <p>from the En­ter­prise Hold­ings po­lit­i­cal ac­tion com­mit­tee, which is associated with the com­pany that owns the En­ter­prise Rent-A-Car, Na­tional Car Rental and Alamo Rent A Car brands.</p>
    <p>Health­care com­pa­nies also are prom­i­nent on the list, in­clud­ing An­them, the health in­surance gi­ant, MedPoint Man­age­ment, which pro­vides man­age­ment ser­vices to physi­cians groups, and Masimo Corp, a maker of elec­tronic pa­tient mon­i­tor­ing de­vices.</p>
    <p>Aerospace and mil­i­tary con­tract­ing gi­ant Boe­ing is also listed as a donor.</p>
    <p>The Bi­den team pro­hib­ited dona­tions from the oil, gas and coal in­dus­tries and reg­is­tered lob­by­ists.</p>
    <p>Labour unions in­clud­ing the Amer­i­can Fed­er­a­tion of Teach­ers, the In­ter­na­tional Brother­hood of Elec­tri­cal Work­ers and the United Food and Com­mer­cial Work­ers union made con­tri­bu­tions as well.</p>
    <p>There was also a sprin­kling of celebritie­s on the list, in­clud­ing singer Bar­bra Streisand.</p>
    <p>The fundrais­ing ef­fort is likely to pale in com­par­i­son to the record US$107 mil­lion raised four years ago by Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump for his in­au­gu­ra­tion, with dona­tions of</p>
    <p>as much as US$5 mil­lion from ma­jor sup­port­ers like casino ex­ec­u­tive Shel­don Adel­son.</p>
    <p>Mr Bi­den has urged his sup­port­ers not to travel to Washington for the in­au­gu­ra­tion on Jan 20, be­cause out­side of the swear­ing-in cer­e­mony, there will be few largescale in-per­son events.</p>
    <p>In his last mes­sage be­fore Twit­ter banned him, Mr Trump said that he would not be at­tend­ing.</p>
    <p>Vice-Pres­i­dent Mike Pence will break with the Pres­i­dent and at­tend, how­ever, two sources fa­mil­iar with his plans said.</p>
