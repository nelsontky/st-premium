    <p>• Storm Iota un­leashed dev­as­tat­ing floods across Cen­tral Amer­ica on Wed­nes­day in ar­eas al­ready wa­ter­logged, forc­ing hun­dreds of thou­sands of peo­ple from their homes in a dis­as­ter that could spur mi­gra­tion to the United States.</p>
    <p>More than 30 peo­ple were killed and the toll in the im­pov­er­ished re­gion was ex­pected to rise as res­cue workers reach iso­lated com­mu­ni­ties.</p>
    <p>While nu­mer­ous vil­lages from north­ern Colom­bia to south­ern Mex­ico have seen record rain­fall swelling rivers and trig­ger­ing mud­slides, cities like the Hon­duran in­dus­trial hub of San Pe­dro Sula have also been hit hard. The city’s air­port was com­pletely flooded, video posted on social media showed.</p>
    <p>The strong­est storm on record to hit Nicaragua, Iota struck the coast late on Mon­day, un­leash­ing Cat­e­gory 5-mag­ni­tude winds and in­un­dat­ing low-ly­ing ar­eas still reel­ing from the im­pact two weeks ago of Eta, an­other ma­jor hur­ri­cane.</p>
    <p>Some 160,000 Nicaraguan­s and 70,000 Hon­durans have been forced to flee to shelters.</p>
    <p>Ms Karen Val­ladares, the head of Hon­duras’ Fon­amih mi­grants agency, warned that the dev­as­ta­tion would ac­cel­er­ate mi­gra­tion to the US over the next few months. “That shouldn’t sur­prise us,” she said.</p>
    <p>While Iota had largely dis­si­pated over El Sal­vador on Wed­nes­day, the au­thor­i­ties across Nicaragua and Hon­duras were strug­gling with the fall­out from days of heavy rain. Most of the dead were in Nicaragua, where the au­thor­i­ties said a mother and her four chil­dren were swept away by a river that over­flowed its banks, while a land­slide in the north killed at least eight peo­ple, with many miss­ing.</p>
    <p>In La Dalia, a ru­ral out­post in north­ern Nicaragua, po­lice would let only the state media pass where mud­slides are be­lieved to have trapped some res­i­dents.</p>
    <p>The US Na­tional Hur­ri­cane Cen­tre said Iota’s rem­nants could trig­ger more flood­ing and mud­slides across Cen­tral Amer­ica through yesterday as it drifted west to­wards the Pa­cific Ocean.</p>
    <p>In Nicaragua’s coastal Bilwi city, Iota de­mol­ished much of the in­fra­struc­ture in the city, said local gov­ern­ment of­fi­cial Yamil Za­p­ata. “What Eta left stand­ing, this hur­ri­cane came and fin­ished it off,” Mr Za­p­ata said.</p>
