    <p>More people are re­port­ing pos­si­ble in­ci­dents of fam­ily vi­o­lence as the Gov­ern­ment ramps up ef­forts to raise aware­ness and de­tec­tion of the is­sue, in­clud­ing train­ing pharmacy staff to de­tect signs of abuse in cus­tomers.</p>
    <p>The Min­istry of So­cial and Fam­ily De­vel­op­ment’s (MSF) Adult and Child Pro­tec­tive ser­vices saw a 25 per cent in­crease in the monthly av­er­age num­ber of in­quiries post-cir­cuit breaker, in the months of June to Septem­ber, com­pared with dur­ing April and May.</p>
    <p>Ms Sun Xuel­ing, Min­is­ter of State for So­cial and Fam­ily De­vel­op­ment as well as Ed­u­ca­tion, said the in­crease in in­quiries is in part due to mem­bers of the pub­lic be­ing more vig­i­lant in re­port­ing pos­si­ble in­ci­dents.</p>
    <p>But she noted that the num­ber of in­ci­dents in­ves­ti­gated from Jan­uary to Septem­ber this year re­mains at a monthly av­er­age of 118.</p>
    <p>Speak­ing at the Na­tional Fam­ily Vi­o­lence Net­work­ing Sys­tem Con­fer­ence held vir­tu­ally yes­ter­day, Ms Sun also an­nounced that MSF is part­ner­ing Unity phar­ma­cies to de­tect signs and symp­toms of fam­ily vi­o­lence.</p>
    <p>It will train 46 staff of the FairPrice-owned chain, which has more than 60 stores around the coun­try.</p>
    <p>Unity phar­ma­cists will un­dergo train­ing to­day to bet­ter iden­tify pos­si­ble vic­tims of fam­ily vi­o­lence.</p>
    <p>“This can help widen and strengthen our com­mu­nity de­tec­tion ef­forts and pro­vide ad­di­tional touch­points to di­rect po­ten­tial vic­tims to help chan­nels,” said Ms Sun, ad­dress­ing about 500 ex­perts and prac­ti­tion­ers from var­i­ous sec­tors, who also dis­cussed col­lab­o­ra­tive ap­proaches to fam­ily pro­tec­tion at the con­fer­ence.</p>
    <p>Be­sides the part­ner­ship with Unity, MSF has part­nered re­li­gious or­gan­i­sa­tions such as the Is­lamic Re­li­gious Coun­cil of Sin­ga­pore and the Pres­by­te­rian Church in Sin­ga­pore to con­duct train­ing on fam­ily vi­o­lence aware­ness.</p>
    <p>Ms Sun said the min­istry is also work­ing with busi­nesses to con­duct out­reach on the topic.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing the ex­tended cir­cuit breaker, which started in April, the newly formed in­ter-agency task force on fam­ily vi­o­lence noted that in­di­vid­u­als and fam­i­lies may be ex­pe­ri­enc­ing more stress, which could lead to vi­o­lence.</p>
    <p>Said Ms Sun: “While there has been great em­pha­sis on how Covid-19 has im­pacted our work, we must recog­nise that the is­sue of fam­ily vi­o­lence goes be­yond the Covid-19 pan­demic.”</p>
    <p>The task force, which was formed in Fe­bru­ary, held its first fo­cus group dis­cus­sion vir­tu­ally in Au­gust, with more than 40 com­mu­nity part­ners com­ing to­gether to dis­cuss tack­ling fam­ily vi­o­lence be­yond Covid-19.</p>
    <p>“Some of the facts and ar­eas that have been dis­cussed re­late to the im­por­tance of look­ing at fam­ily struc­tures, liv­ing en­vi­ron­ments, fi­nan­cial stres­sors and also the abil­ity of in­di­vid­u­als to man­age con­flict,” Ms Sun said.</p>
    <p>A sec­ond fo­cus group dis­cus­sion is be­ing planned for the first quar­ter of next year.</p>
    <p>“We will be tak­ing a deeper dive into some of these top­ics that have been raised. What’s im­por­tant is that we look at up­stream fac­tors, be­cause we want to pre­vent vi­o­lence be­fore it oc­curs.”</p>
    <p>The co-chair­men of the fo­cus group work­stream – United Women Sin­ga­pore pres­i­dent Ge­or­gette Tan, Sin­ga­pore Coun­cil of Women’s Or­gan­i­sa­tions (SCWO) head of di­rect ser­vices Lor­raine Lim and Casa Raudha Women Home man­ager Za­harah Ariff – also at­tended the con­fer­ence.</p>
    <p>They shared their or­gan­i­sa­tions’ ini­tia­tives to tackle fam­ily vi­o­lence.</p>
    <p>United Women Sin­ga­pore has a GenSafe Work­places pro­gramme, meant to sup­port em­ploy­ees who may be vic­tims of abuse. The non-profit or­gan­i­sa­tion will be con­duct­ing a foun­da­tional pro­gramme for 700 E-Bridge Pre-school em­ploy­ees next month.</p>
    <p>The Work­places pro­gramme aims to sup­port em­ploy­ees im­pacted by do­mes­tic vi­o­lence by, among other things, equip­ping or­gan­i­sa­tions with the skills to re­spond to those suf­fer­ing in si­lence.</p>
    <p>Said Ms Tan: “In the com­ing year, we hope to reach out to an­other 100 busi­nesses in Sin­ga­pore, rang­ing from fi­nance to phar­ma­ceu­ti­cal to tech­nol­ogy and con­sumer in­dus­tries.”</p>
    <p>Next Mon­day, SCWO will be launch­ing a on­estop help web­site, ACT Against Vi­o­lence, to pro­vide in­for­ma­tion to women of all ages cop­ing with vi­o­lence, while Casa Raudha is cur­rently hold­ing a week-long walkathon that be­gan on Saturday to raise aware­ness of do­mes­tic vi­o­lence.</p>
