    <p>For Brew­lan­der founder John Wei, his goal is to put Sin­ga­pore craft beer on the map, with a brand linked to the red dot that peo­ple will re­mem­ber.</p>
    <p>“If you go to New York, there’s Brook­lyn Lager, or if you go to Lon­don, there are iconic craft beers like FourPure or Cam­den Town that are linked to that city.</p>
    <p>“But here, I don’t think there’s an iconic Sin­ga­pore craft beer brand that you have to try,” says the 37-year-old, who worked in fi­nance and re­gional busi­ness devel­op­ment be­fore mak­ing the ca­reer switch to brew­ing.</p>
    <p>“That’s why I went into this – to cre­ate a Sin­ga­pore brand and beer that could stand side by side with any in­ter­na­tional brand.”</p>
    <p>He has started mov­ing brew­ing op­er­a­tions in Cam­bo­dia back to Sin­ga­pore so that he can make beers here at a lower cost and in larger quan­ti­ties at his own brew­ery in Tuas.</p>
    <p>The brew­ery, which is set to open by the end of this year, is a long time com­ing for Mr Wei, who started mak­ing craft beers in his HDB flat in 2008, ac­com­pa­nied by a well-fol­lowed blog in 2012.</p>
    <p>After be­com­ing a re­spected fig­ure and beer judge on the home-brew­ing scene, he founded Brew­lan­der in 2017, op­er­at­ing from Cam­bo­dia.</p>
    <p>With the open­ing of his new brew­ery in an in­dus­trial build­ing op­po­site Tuas West MRT, he hopes to give peo­ple the “brew­ery fresh ex­pe­ri­ence”, with brew­ery tours, a tast­ing room and mas­ter­classes.</p>
    <p>The state-of-the-art brew­ery, which cov­ers a 7,000 sq ft space, is home to 15 steel fer­menters of sizes vary­ing from 1,500 to 6,000 litres. The tallest tow­ers are 4.7m.</p>
    <p>While the larger fer­menters will hold his best-sell­ing beers like Love (Wild IPA) and Hope (Sum­mer Ale), the smaller ones will be used for ex­per­i­men­tal brews us­ing dif­fer­ent yeast strains or dry hop­ping (the ad­di­tion of loose hops late in the brew­ing process).</p>
    <p>The fa­cil­ity’s “crown jewel”, ac­cord­ing to Mr Wei, is a bot­tling and can­ning line, which can pump out 6,000 filled and la­belled cans and bot­tles ev­ery hour.</p>
    <p>Four years on, Mr Wei is well aware that Brew­lan­der’s ef­forts as a lo­cal craft beer brand have set the prece­dent for other play­ers now en­ter­ing the scene.</p>
    <p>He is proud to have “built a prece­dent that you can build a sus­tain­able craft beer busi­ness here”.</p>
    <p>“Now, peo­ple can do the sums and say, ‘I can start a brew­ery in Sin­ga­pore and be prof­itable’,” he adds.</p>
