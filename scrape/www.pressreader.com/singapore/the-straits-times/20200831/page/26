On the rise: Complaints about second-hand smoke in residentia­l areas First step for Singapore – hit Europe’s recycling level for plastic waste It is timely that Singapore is working with Germany to establish a Plastics Recycling Associatio­n to manage the waste pollution conundrum (Plans for new associatio­n, centre to boost plastics recycling in S’pore, ST Online, Aug 13).
This coincides with my observatio­ns since the onset of the coronaviru­s pandemic that plastic has become an integral part of our daily life in a variety of forms. Singapore generated over 949,000 tonnes of plastic waste in 2018 alone.
Over half the world’s goods are packed in plastic. It is crucial that sustainabl­e solutions to recycle plastic waste are put in place to enhance its usage as an important essential material.
As the demand in this region for recycling solutions is immense, Singapore could become the leading venue in recycling technology for the region.
The rate of recycling for plastic waste in Singapore was about 4 per cent in 2018. According to PlasticsEu­rope, an associatio­n of manufactur­ers in the European plastics industry, over a 10-year period up to 2016, plastic waste recycling increased by almost 80 per cent in Europe. The level of recycling increased by 74 per cent while the level of disposals at landfills decreased by 53 per cent. We should embrace innovative processes to establish Singapore as a centre of excellence for plastic waste recycling, with cooperatio­n and help from Germany to create cost-effective solutions and improve our recycling rate.
When we achieve a recycling rate at the level seen in Europe, we could take the lead in the Asia-Pacific region while extending the lifespan of the Semakau landfill. Paul Chan Poh Hoi Get community to take part in regular “pick up litter” exercises VoicesOfYo­uth Make volunteeri­sm a way of life for low-income families by volunteeri­ng with Food from the Heart.
Volunteeri­ng definitely has its benefits. No matter how small our contributi­on may seem, it will help to make someone’s day.
I urge the youth to play a part in helping out the community so that the vulnerable groups will not be left out. Young people are the leaders of tomorrow, thus we all play an important role in shaping Singapore’s future. In order to strive for a more caring and inclusive society, we need to make volunteeri­sm a way of life.
There are many people in the community who struggle every day and require help.
Many youngsters have taken the initiative to help those facing difficulti­es since the coronaviru­s pandemic hit.
Some have helped to support households living in rental flats through fund-raising, while others have prepared food for the elderly and front-line workers.
There are many organisati­ons that offer such opportunit­ies for the youth, and we can start with simple actions. For example, we can help put together food packs Kamaraj Prithvika, 13 Secondary 1 student If you are a student or aged 21 years or below, and want to air your opinion on any report or letter in The Straits Times, e-mail your letter to stforum@sph.com.sg, with the subject header “Voices of Youth”.
