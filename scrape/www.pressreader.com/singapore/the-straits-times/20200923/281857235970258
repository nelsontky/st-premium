    <p>The Philip­pines’ re­vival of its claim over Sabah has come just in time for politi­cians in Malaysia’s east­ern­most state to take to the stump ahead of its Sept 26 vote.</p>
    <p>De­spite diplo­matic and de­fence mat­ters fall­ing un­der the purview of the fed­eral gov­ern­ment in Kuala Lumpur, it is in­cum­bent chief min­is­ter Shafie Ap­dal who has been put on the de­fen­sive by al­lies of Prime Min­is­ter Muhyid­din Yassin over a sug­ges­tion that Malaysia dis­cuss the mat­ter with its neigh­bour.</p>
    <p>The spark was lit on July 27 – just days be­fore the state leg­is­la­ture was dis­solved – when Philip­pine For­eign Sec­re­tary Teodoro Loc­sin posted on Twit­ter that “Sabah is not in Malaysia if you want to have any­thing to do with the Philip­pines”, a state­ment that was im­me­di­ately re­buffed by his Malaysian coun­ter­part.</p>
    <p>The war of words be­tween the two na­tions has con­tin­ued, with Manila con­firm­ing last week it would re­ac­ti­vate its North Bor­neo Bureau, us­ing the his­tor­i­cal name for the eastern por­tion of Sabah that was once ruled by the Sulu Sul­tanate.</p>
    <p>Al­though Malaysians do not be­lieve there is a dan­ger of ced­ing the Bor­neon ter­ri­tory to the Philip­pines, the is­sue of sovereignt­y dove­tails with ris­ing state na­tion­al­ism and na­tivism, a cen­tral theme in the bat­tle for con­trol of Sabah.</p>
    <p>Ini­tially, Parti Warisan Sabah pres­i­dent Shafie was ac­cused of be­ing silent in the face of Mr Loc­sin’s hawk­ish stance.</p>
    <p>But his re­sponses last month – that Sabah is mak­ing rep­re­sen­ta­tions in the Span­ish court and that Kuala Lumpur should “ne­go­ti­ate gov­ern­ment-to-gov­ern­ment” with Manila un­der the aus­pices of Asean – only deep­ened crit­i­cism that he was en­cour­ag­ing the Filipino claim.</p>
    <p>Malaysia’s For­eign Min­is­ter Hisham­mud­din Hus­sein in­sisted last week: “Malaysia does not recog­nise the Philip­pines’ claim. So, there is no rea­son to hold ne­go­ti­a­tions. Or is Shafie propos­ing that the Philip­pines’ claim has mer­its?”</p>
    <p>For­mer premier Na­jib Razak said last week “not even four days af­ter Shafie’s shock state­ment, the Filipino gov­ern­ment an­nounced they would re­open the gov­ern­ment of­fice (that has been shut for more than 30 years) to of­fi­cially claim Sabah”.</p>
    <p>He also boasted that dur­ing his nine years as premier up to 2018, Manila had not raised this claim over Sabah, de­spite then Pres­i­den­t­elect Ro­drigo Duterte vow­ing in</p>
    <p>May 2016 to pur­sue it.</p>
    <p>“This (not ac­knowl­edg­ing a ri­val claim) is the most fun­da­men­tal thing in diplo­macy. He has erred – who knows whether on pur­pose or not,” added Na­jib, a law­maker from Umno, which sup­ports the Muhyid­din ad­min­is­tra­tion.</p>
    <p>The in­sin­u­a­tion in his state­ment is one of­ten re­peated by al­lies in the rul­ing Perikatan Na­sional pact.</p>
    <p>Since Warisan first took power in Sabah af­ter the May 2018 elec­tion, it has been per­sis­tently ac­cused of be­ing a “party of il­le­gal im­mi­grants”, draw­ing links to its leader’s sup­posed Su­luk her­itage.</p>
    <p>The Mus­lim eth­nic group is con­cen­trated not only in Mr Shafie’s strong­hold of east Sabah, but also in south­ern Philip­pines.</p>
    <p>An­a­lysts see the Filipino claim as be­ing con­flated po­lit­i­cally with the decades-old frus­tra­tion over un­doc­u­mented mi­grants – a top elec­tion is­sue – who, some stud­ies be­lieve, make up nearly a third of Sabah’s four mil­lion pop­u­la­tion.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore In­sti­tute of In­ter­na­tional Af­fairs se­nior fel­low Oh Ei Sun, who hails from Sabah, told The Straits Times: “The main im­plied mes­sage here is Shafie is the leader of the un­doc­u­mented mi­grants, who are lord­ing over in­dige­nous Saba­hans in an at­tempt to rile up anti-Warisan sen­ti­ments.”</p>
    <p>But Mr Shafie has shot back, in­sist­ing he called for ne­go­ti­a­tions not into the own­er­ship of Sabah, but into the grave se­cu­rity con­cerns that have plagued the eastern coast for years. “The area that has been at­tacked by pi­rates the most is our east coast. We are be­ing kid­napped and killed,” he said.</p>
    <p>Mr Shafie also took aim at the lack of mil­i­tary re­in­force­ments since the shock Fe­bru­ary 2013 in­cur­sion by Filipino gun­men un­der the aus­pices of a claimant to the Sulu throne.</p>
    <p>“There is not a sin­gle bat­tal­ion. What’s the point of hav­ing mil­i­tary bases all over Penin­su­lar Malaysia? There is not a sin­gle fighter jet here,” he added.</p>
    <p>Two men in Na­jib’s Cab­i­net dur­ing the 2013 in­va­sion con­tinue to play key roles in the rul­ing coali­tion. They are Mr Hisham­mud­din, who was then the Min­is­ter for De­fence, and Umno pres­i­dent Zahid Hamidi, who was the Min­is­ter for Home Af­fairs.</p>
