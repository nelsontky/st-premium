    <p>LON­DON • Amer­i­can drug­maker Pfizer and its Ger­man part­ner BioN­Tech on Wed­nes­day said that doc­u­ments re­lated to the devel­op­ment of their Covid-19 vac­cine had been “un­law­fully ac­cessed” in a cy­ber at­tack on Europe’s medicine reg­u­la­tor.</p>
    <p>The Euro­pean Medicines Agency (EMA), which as­sesses medicines and vac­cines for the Euro­pean Union, said hours ear­lier it had been tar­geted in a cy­ber at­tack. It gave no fur­ther details.</p>
    <p>Pfizer and BioN­Tech said they did not be­lieve any per­sonal data of trial par­tic­i­pants had been com­pro­mised, and EMA “has as­sured us that the at­tack will have no im­pact on the time­line for its re­view”.</p>
    <p>It was not clear when or how the at­tack took place, who was re­spon­si­ble or what other in­for­ma­tion may have been com­pro­mised.</p>
    <p>The two com­pa­nies said they had been in­formed by the EMA “that the agency has been sub­ject to a cy­ber at­tack and that some doc­u­ments re­lat­ing to the reg­u­la­tory sub­mis­sion for Pfizer and BioN­Tech’s Covid-19 vac­cine can­di­date” had been viewed.</p>
    <p>Such doc­u­ments could be ex­tremely valu­able to other coun­tries and com­pa­nies rush­ing to de­velop vac­cines, ex­perts said.</p>
    <p>Mr Marc Rogers, founder of CTILeague, a vol­un­teer group fight­ing</p>
    <p>Covid-re­lated breaches, said: “When it comes to the data sub­mit­ted to these kinds of reg­u­la­tory bod­ies, we are talk­ing con­fi­den­tial in­for­ma­tion about the vac­cine and its mech­a­nism of ac­tion, its ef­fi­ciency, its risks and known pos­si­ble side ef­fects, and any unique as­pects such as han­dling guide­lines.</p>
    <p>“It also pro­vides de­tailed in­for­ma­tion on other par­ties in­volved in the sup­ply and distributi­on of the vac­cine.”</p>
    <p>The phar­ma­ceu­ti­cal com­pa­nies said “no BioN­Tech or Pfizer sys­tems have been breached in con­nec­tion with this in­ci­dent, and we are un­aware that any study par­tic­i­pants have been iden­ti­fied through the data be­ing ac­cessed”.</p>
    <p>The Pfizer-BioN­Tech vac­cine is a top con­tender in the global race to beat back Covid-19. It is al­ready be­ing ad­min­is­tered in Bri­tain.</p>
    <p>EMA has said it would com­plete its re­view by Dec 29, al­though its sched­ule may change.</p>
    <p>The EMA state­ment gave few details about the at­tack, say­ing only that it was in­ves­ti­gat­ing with help from law en­force­ment.</p>
    <p>“EMA can­not pro­vide ad­di­tional details while the in­ves­ti­ga­tion is on­go­ing,” it said in a state­ment.</p>
    <p>Since the coro­n­avirus pan­demic be­gan, hack­ers have tar­geted a slew of phar­ma­ceu­ti­cal and vac­cine devel­op­ment firms in­clud­ing Gilead, John­son & John­son, No­vavax and Moderna.</p>
    <p>Mr Rogers, who is also a vi­cepres­i­dent at se­cu­rity com­pany Okta, said: “Vac­cine can­di­dates rep­re­sent liq­uid gold to many par­ties, both in terms of the op­por­tu­nity and the pure mar­ket value.”</p>
