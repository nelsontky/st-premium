    <p>Malaysian Prime Min­is­ter Muhyid­din Yassin’s 11th-hour in­ter­ven­tion has failed to un­tan­gle over­lap­ping claims for seats among his al­lies in the Sabah state polls, rais­ing ques­tions about the unity within his Perikatan Na­sional (PN) gov­ern­ment.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, which was Nom­i­na­tion Day for the Sept 26 polls, the Premier an­nounced a so-called al­liance, dubbed Gabun­gan Rakyat Sabah, of the three fac­tions in the state aligned to him. Yet, af­ter nom­i­na­tions closed, they clashed in 17 of the 73 seats up for grabs, hurt­ing their chances of top­pling the Parti Warisan Sabah-led ad­min­is­tra­tion.</p>
    <p>This could por­tent fu­ture dis­agree­ments – be­tween the par­ties who have for­mally signed up to PN, the Umno-led Barisan Na­sional (BN) and smaller par­ties which sup­port the Premier – when a gen­eral elec­tion, which is ex­pected within months, is held.</p>
    <p>“This is a sneak peek to what will hap­pen at the gen­eral elec­tion. Pre­vi­ous prime min­is­ters were lead­ers of a sin­gle rul­ing pact, BN. But now pre­vi­ous ar­range­ments or seat al­lo­ca­tions have col­lapsed,” risk con­sul­tancy Bow­erGroupAsi­a’s di­rec­tor Adib Zalka­pli told The Sun­day Times.</p>
    <p>Af­ter the shock end of Umno’s sixdecade rule in 2018, most BN par­ties left the coali­tion, but later re­grouped un­der Parti Pribumi Ber­satu Malaysia (Ber­satu) pres­i­dent Muhyid­din’s lead­er­ship when de­fec­tions top­pled the pre­vi­ous Pakatan Hara­pan (PH) gov­ern­ment in Kuala Lumpur in Fe­bru­ary.</p>
    <p>The par­ties that form the fed­eral gov­ern­ment are now grouped un­der at least four sep­a­rate um­brel­las.</p>
    <p>Ac­com­mo­dat­ing Ber­satu – which wants to be a ma­jor na­tional party given that its leader, whether the ousted Tun Dr Ma­hathir Mo­hamad or Tan Sri Muhyid­din, had been prime min­is­ter for the past two years – means other par­ties will have to ac­cept fewer seats, which they seem ret­i­cent to do.</p>
    <p>For­mer BN com­po­nent Parti Ber­satu Sabah (PBS) – which led the state gov­ern­ment from 1985 to 1994 – has de­cided to con­test now un­der its own ban­ner de­spite both BN and PN coax­ing it to use their lo­gos.</p>
    <p>“There is a strong anti-Malaya sen­ti­ment as Saba­hans want more au­ton­omy,” a top PBS of­fi­cial told The Sun­day Times.</p>
    <p>“So, strate­gi­cally, we are us­ing our own flag, and if we win most of the 22 seats we con­test, why shouldn’t we stake a claim to the chief min­is­ter­ship in­stead of Umno or Ber­satu?”</p>
    <p>One top Sabah PN leader told The Sun­day Times that “the prob­lem now is we have three sep­a­rate bod­ies uni­lat­er­ally is­su­ing cre­den­tials for can­di­dates in­stead of be­fore, when there was only one can­di­date fly­ing the BN flag in any con­stituency”.</p>
    <p>The Premier flew into Sabah early on Fri­day and a planned quick break­fast with party lead­ers turned into a nearly two-hour show­down that failed to find a so­lu­tion to the 11 over­lap­ping con­tests at the time.</p>
    <p>Umno pres­i­dent Ah­mad Zahid Hamidi said af­ter the meet­ing that all par­ties had reached a con­sen­sus to avoid clashes which would split sup­port. But even af­ter a late-night meet­ing, most stuck to their guns on Nom­i­na­tion Day, lead­ing to a rare oc­cur­rence in Malaysia, where mem­bers of the fed­eral gov­ern­ment find them­selves bat­tling their own al­lies at an elec­tion.</p>
    <p>Af­ter nom­i­na­tions closed, Mr Muhyid­din said: “What is im­por­tant is that we will work as a team to form a gov­ern­ment that will develop Sabah.</p>
    <p>“Mem­bers at all lev­els must put aside all dis­agree­ments and old grudges to em­brace a new spirit of Gabun­gan Rakyat Sabah. No sin­gle party can form the gov­ern­ment.”</p>
    <p>But the sug­ges­tion in his speech that Ber­satu’s Sabah chief Ha­jiji Noor be made chief min­is­ter was im­me­di­ately re­buffed by Umno, which in­sisted a de­ci­sion would be made only af­ter re­sults were known.</p>
    <p>Given Umno’s ret­i­cence to join PN, all in­di­ca­tions are that the Sabah im­passe among par­ties in the pact will be re­peated at the next gen­eral elec­tion.</p>
    <p>Umno and Parti Is­lam SeMalaysia, an­other key mem­ber of PN, have been agitating for fresh elec­tions to end the in­sta­bil­ity stem­ming from the gov­ern­ment’s slim 113 to 109 ma­jor­ity in Par­lia­ment.</p>
    <p>But with 222 par­lia­men­tary and nearly 500 state assem­bly seats up for grabs, it will be far more dif­fi­cult to re­solve than the in­tractable quib­bling over the 73-strong Sabah leg­isla­tive cham­ber.</p>
