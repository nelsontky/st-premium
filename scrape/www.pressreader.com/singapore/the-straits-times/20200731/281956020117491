    <p>“De­colonise this place!” “De­colonise the univer­sity!” “De­colonise the mu­seum!”</p>
    <p>In the past few years, de­coloni­sa­tion has gained new po­lit­i­cal cur­rency – in­side the bor­ders of the old colo­nial pow­ers.</p>
    <p>Indige­nous move­ments have re­claimed the man­tle of “de­coloni­sa­tion” in protests like those at Stand­ing Rock against the Dakota Ac­cess pipe­line.</p>
    <p>Stu­dents from South Africa to Bri­tain have marched un­der its ban­ner to chal­lenge eu­ro­cen­tric cur­ric­ula.</p>
    <p>Mu­se­ums such as the Nat­u­ral His­tory Mu­seum in New York and the Royal Mu­seum for Cen­tral Africa in Brus­sels have been com­pelled to con­front their rep­re­sen­ta­tion of colonised African and indige­nous peo­ples.</p>
    <p>But what is “de­coloni­sa­tion”? What the word means and what it re­quires have been con­tested for a cen­tury.</p>
    <p>After World War I, Euro­pean colo­nial ad­min­is­tra­tors viewed de­coloni­sa­tion as the process in which they would al­low their im­pe­rial charges to grad­u­ate to in­de­pen­dence by mod­el­ling them­selves on Euro­pean states.</p>
    <p>But in the mid-20th cen­tury, anti-colo­nial ac­tivists and in­tel­lec­tu­als de­manded im­me­di­ate in­de­pen­dence and re­fused to model their so­ci­eties on the terms set by im­pe­ri­al­ists.</p>
    <p>Be­tween 1945 and 1975, as strug­gles for in­de­pen­dence were won in Africa and Asia, United Na­tions mem­ber­ship grew from 51 to 144 coun­tries. In that pe­riod, de­coloni­sa­tion was pri­mar­ily po­lit­i­cal and eco­nomic.</p>
    <p>As more colonies gained in­de­pen­dence, how­ever, cul­tural de­coloni­sa­tion be­came more sig­nif­i­cant. Euro­pean po­lit­i­cal and eco­nomic dom­i­na­tion co­in­cided with a eu­ro­cen­trism that val­orised Euro­pean civil­i­sa­tion as the apex of hu­man achieve­ment.</p>
    <p>Indige­nous cul­tural tra­di­tions and sys­tems of knowl­edge were den­i­grated as back­ward and un­civilised. The colonised were treated as peo­ple with­out his­tory.</p>
    <p>The strug­gle against this has been es­pe­cially cen­tral in set­tler colonies in which the dis­place­ment of indige­nous in­sti­tu­tions was most vi­o­lent.</p>
    <p>South Africa, where a reck­on­ing with the per­sis­tence of the set­tler regime has gripped na­tional pol­i­tics, reignited the lat­est calls for de­coloni­sa­tion in 2015 with the #RhodesMust­Fall move­ment. Stu­dents at the Univer­sity of Cape Town tar­geted the statue of Bri­tish im­pe­ri­al­ist Ce­cil Rhodes, but saw its re­moval as only the open­ing act in a wider strug­gle to bring white supremacy to an end. Un­der the ban­ners of “more than a statue” and “de­colonise the univer­sity”, stu­dents called for so­cial and eco­nomic trans­for­ma­tion to undo the racial hi­er­ar­chies that per­sist in post-apartheid South Africa, free univer­sity tu­ition and an Africa-cen­tred cur­ricu­lum.</p>
    <p>Now, partly rid­ing the global surge of Black Lives Mat­ter mo­bil­i­sa­tions, calls for de­coloni­sa­tion have swept Europe’s for­mer im­pe­rial metropoles.</p>
    <p>In Bris­tol, Eng­land, last month, pro­test­ers tore down the statue of Ed­ward Col­ston, the di­rec­tor of the Royal African Com­pany, which dom­i­nated the African slave trade in the 17th and 18th cen­turies.</p>
    <p>Across Bel­gium, pro­test­ers have fo­cused on stat­ues of King Leopold II, who ruled the Congo Free State (now the Demo­cratic Repub­lic of Congo) as his per­sonal prop­erty from 1885 to 1908. King Philippe of Bel­gium re­cently ex­pressed “re­gret” for his an­ces­tor’s brutal regime, which caused the death of 10 mil­lion peo­ple.</p>
    <p>Colo­nial­ism, the pro­test­ers in­sist, did not just shape the global south. It made Europe and the mod­ern world. Prof­its from the slave trade fu­elled the rise of port cities like Bris­tol, Liver­pool and Lon­don, while the At­lantic econ­omy that slav­ery cre­ated helped to fuel the In­dus­trial Revo­lu­tion.</p>
    <p>King Leopold amassed a for­tune of well over US$1.1 bil­lion</p>
    <p>(S$1.5 bil­lion) in to­day’s dol­lars from Congo. His vi­sion of the Royal Mu­seum for Cen­tral Africa, which opened in 1910 soon after his death, re­pro­duced a nar­ra­tive of African back­ward­ness, while ob­scur­ing the vi­o­lent ex­ploita­tion of the Con­golese.</p>
    <p>By tear­ing down or de­fac­ing these stat­ues, pro­test­ers burst open the na­tional nar­ra­tive and force a con­fronta­tion with the his­tory of em­pire. This is a de­coloni­sa­tion of the sen­sory world, the il­lu­sion that em­pire was some­where else.</p>
    <p>Lay­ing a flag of the Demo­cratic Repub­lic of Congo on the statue of King Leopold or haul­ing the</p>
    <p>Col­ston statue into the sea, where thou­sands of en­slaved women and men lost their lives, tears apart the blin­ders and bound­aries be­tween past and present, metropole and colony. In­sist­ing on the pres­ence of the past, the protests re­veal Europe’s ro­mance with it­self, un­mask­ing its po­lit­i­cal and eco­nomic achieve­ments as the prod­uct of en­slave­ment and colo­nial ex­ploita­tion.</p>
    <p>This his­tor­i­cal reck­on­ing is only the first step. Ac­knowl­edg­ing that colo­nial his­tory shapes the cur­rent in­equal­i­ties and hi­er­ar­chies that struc­ture the world sets the stage for the next one: repa­ra­tions and resti­tu­tion.</p>
    <p>Repa­ra­tions is not a sin­gle act. The Caribbean com­mu­nity has al­ready de­manded repa­ra­tions for slav­ery and indige­nous geno­cide from Bri­tain, France, Spain and the Nether­lands.</p>
    <p>Although there is lit­tle move­ment at the level of states, the Univer­sity of Glas­gow agreed last year to pay £20 mil­lion (S$36 mil­lion) for de­vel­op­ment re­search with the Univer­sity of the West Indies in recog­ni­tion of how the univer­sity ben­e­fited from the prof­its of the trans-At­lantic slave trade.</p>
    <p>The Herero of Namibia, who suf­fered the 20th cen­tury’s first geno­cide at the hands of Ger­many, have also called for re­dress.</p>
    <p>Their ef­forts fol­low the suc­cess­ful bid for repa­ra­tions by the Mau Mau of Kenya, many of whom were tor­tured dur­ing Bri­tain’s brutal sup­pres­sion of their in­de­pen­dence move­ment in the mid-20th cen­tury.</p>
    <p>In other con­texts, ac­tivists have fo­cused on the re­turn of the looted arte­facts that fill Europe’s great mu­se­ums. France, for in­stance, has com­mit­ted to re­turn­ing 26 stolen art­works to Benin.</p>
    <p>But repa­ra­tions should not fo­cus only on the for­mer colonies and their re­la­tions with Euro­pean states. Colo­nial­ism lives on in­side Europe’s bor­ders, and Europe it­self must be de­colonised.</p>
    <p>Black Euro­peans ex­pe­ri­ence dis­crim­i­na­tion in em­ploy­ment and ed­u­ca­tion, are racially pro­filed and are sub­ject to racist vi­o­lence at the hands of the po­lice and fel­low cit­i­zens.</p>
    <p>The Euro­pean Union re­cently avowed that “black lives mat­ter”, but its poli­cies de­prive black peo­ple of equal rights, im­prison them in camps and drown them in the Mediter­ranean.</p>
    <p>Over­seas im­pe­ri­al­ism was once be­lieved to be a po­lit­i­cal ne­ces­sity for Euro­pean states; to­day, anti-im­mi­grant pol­i­tics plays the same role. In ei­ther case, Euro­pean pol­i­cy­mak­ers dis­avow re­spon­si­bil­ity for the mis­ery they bring about.</p>
    <p>Re­pair and re­dress are owed as much to black Euro­peans as they are to for­mer colo­nial states.</p>
    <p>It would mean treat­ing black Euro­peans, and all mi­grants from the colonised world, as equal par­tic­i­pants in Euro­pean so­ci­ety.</p>
    <p>And this form of repa­ra­tion can­not be per­ceived as one-off trans­ac­tions. In­stead, it must be the ba­sis of build­ing an in­clu­sive and egal­i­tar­ian Europe.</p>
    <p>This is no easy task and will not hap­pen overnight. But we should re­mem­ber that just 80 years ago, colo­nial rule ap­peared to be a sta­ble and al­most per­ma­nent fea­ture of in­ter­na­tional pol­i­tics. In just three decades, anti-colo­nial na­tion­al­ists had trans­formed the world’s map.</p>
    <p>The strug­gle for racial equal­ity in Europe is a fight for a truly post-colo­nial con­di­tion, and its cre­ation is im­plied by each de­throned statue. If colo­nial­ism made the mod­ern world, de­coloni­sa­tion can­not be com­plete un­til the world – in­clud­ing Europe – is re­made.</p>
