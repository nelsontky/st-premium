    <p>Would you and your spouse be keen to re­ceive a steady re­tire­ment in­come of more than $4,500 a month for life?</p>
    <p>All you need to do is to en­sure that to­gether you have com­bined sav­ings of more than $550,000 in your Cen­tral Prov­i­dent Fund (CPF) ac­counts when you both hit 55.</p>
    <p>This to­tal sum will en­able both of you to sign up for CPF Life’s high­est tier – the En­hanced Re­tire­ment Sum (ERS) which stands at $279,000 this year. That will en­able each of you to re­ceive a monthly pay­out of up to $2,300 from age 65.</p>
    <p>If both of you are al­ready over 55, it is not too late to top up your re­tire­ment sums to the high­est tier so that you can re­ceive more monthly pay­outs.</p>
    <p>Many peo­ple still do not re­alise that CPF Life can en­able all re­tirees to en­joy such lu­cra­tive monthly in­comes with­out the need to in­vest in a se­cond prop­erty to col­lect rent as re­tire­ment in­come.</p>
    <p>Ask your­self this ques­tion – even if you can buy a prop­erty that costs only about $500,000, there is no guar­an­tee that you will be able to col­lect rents as high as $4,500 a month.</p>
    <p>Note that land­lords need to pay taxes, main­te­nance as well as mort­gages, whereas the pay­out from CPF Life is tax-free in­come that is au­to­mat­i­cally cred­ited to your bank ac­counts ev­ery month, for as long as you live.</p>
    <p>By all means, buy in­vest­ment prop­er­ties if you can af­ford to do so, but don’t miss out on your right to re­ceive such good pay­outs from CPF Life.</p>
    <p>If you and your spouse don’t have so much in the CPF at 55, aim for the se­cond tier – the Full Re­tire­ment Sum (FRS) which stands at $186,000 this year. FRS pro­vides a monthly pay­out of up to $1,500 each.</p>
    <p>This means that a com­bined balance of a lit­tle over $370,000 will al­low a re­tir­ing cou­ple to re­ceive about $3,000 ev­ery month.</p>
    <p>HOW CPF CAN SAVE YOU FROM HAV­ING TO</p>
    <p>WORK PAST RE­TIRE­MENT</p>
    <p>A re­cent OCBC sur­vey re­vealed the sober­ing pic­ture that 75 per cent of Sin­ga­pore­ans face the risk of be­ing short of money in their re­tire­ment.</p>
    <p>About half of these folks are fo­cused on keep­ing up with their monthly ex­penses and do not make any at­tempt to save for old age.</p>
    <p>In­deed, a man who re­acted to the In­vest fea­ture on the sur­vey last month posted this com­ment on The Straits Times Face­book page: “How can I start plan­ning for re­tire­ment when I don’t even have enough money now?”</p>
    <p>Yes, the pan­demic has made life a lot more dif­fi­cult for many work­ers but just like past re­ces­sions, the bad times will blow over. But your needs when you be­come older will re­main and this is some­thing that can­not be wished away.</p>
    <p>Those who find them­selves short should re­ally start to watch their bud­gets and ask: Are there ex­penses which can re­ally be cut down or even done away with?</p>
    <p>Af­ter all, the No. 1 rea­son why peo­ple end up short here is that they spend more than what they earn.</p>
    <p>HOW YOU CAN HELP YOUR­SELF</p>
    <p>Even if you don’t ac­tively keep track of your bud­gets or do fi­nan­cial plan­ning, you should be happy to know that the CPF is qui­etly help­ing all mem­bers to grow their money for their re­tire­ment. But you need to do your part, too.</p>
    <p>• If you are an em­ployee, you have less to worry about be­cause your em­ployer will help you by mak­ing the CPF con­tri­bu­tion ev­ery month. If you are self-em­ployed, it is crit­i­cal that you make your own monthly con­tri­bu­tions or you risk de­priv­ing your­self of the chance to en­joy a steady in­come in old age. The an­nual limit for CPF con­tri­bu­tion is $37,740.</p>
    <p>• If you do not have a cash flow prob­lem, you should re­duce the use of CPF for your mort­gage pay­ment be­cause ev­ery dol­lar in your Or­di­nary Ac­count (OA) earns 2.5 per cent interest, com­pared with only 0.5 per cent of­fered by some banks for fixed de­posits. You can log on to the myCPF por­tal to re­duce the CPF pay­ment for the loan eas­ily so that more cash is de­ducted from your bank ac­count ev­ery month. • Un­less you are very savvy and are fa­mil­iar with all the in­vest­ment prod­ucts, you should not use money from your CPF for in­vest­ment be­cause it earns risk-free interest of up to 6 per cent for the first $30,000. Even at the OA’s 2.5 per cent, sta­tis­tics have shown that most mem­bers do bet­ter by leav­ing their funds in CPF than us­ing them for in­vest­ment.</p>
    <p>In­vest re­cently fea­tured a man who lost more than $200,000 of his CPF money in a botched in­vest­ment.</p>
    <p>As your CPF money is safe from even a bank­ruptcy ac­tion, you do well to treat it as your last line of fi­nan­cial de­fence.</p>
    <p>WHY YOU CAN’T WITH­DRAW ALL THE MONEY IN YOUR CPF AT 55</p>
    <p>Ac­tu­ally you can, pro­vided that you can con­vince the CPF Board that you have al­ready in­vested in a com­pre­hen­sive an­nu­ity plan that can pro­vide you with a guar­an­teed pay­out that is bet­ter than what CPF Life can pro­vide. Frankly, it is doubt­ful if such a plan ex­ists.</p>
    <p>The only rea­son CPF Life can of­fer life­long pay­ment at such low en­try lev­els is that it is backed by the Govern­ment.</p>
    <p>Un­like pri­vate com­pa­nies, the Govern­ment is not in the busi­ness of mak­ing prof­its. See how it dished out some $100 bil­lion to help Sin­ga­pore­ans in the cur­rent cri­sis.</p>
    <p>But to earn such pay­outs, in­di­vid­u­als need to do their part as well, which is to set aside the nec­es­sary re­tire­ment sums in their CPF at 55 so that the money can grow to last a life­time.</p>
    <p>Con­trary to the mis­in­for­ma­tion that CPF is “lock­ing up” peo­ple’s sav­ings for life, this step is needed to help give all CPF mem­bers an op­tion to stop work­ing at 65.</p>
    <p>Ask your­self this ques­tion – do you want to re­ceive a fixed yearly in­come of up to $26,000, to­talling more than half a mil­lion dol­lars over the next 20 years, with­out hav­ing to work?</p>
    <p>The an­swer is ob­vi­ous and this is the rea­son a ma­jor­ity of Sin­ga­pore­ans not only leave larger amounts in the CPF af­ter 55, but are also con­stantly think­ing of ways to put in more money to earn the high risk­free interest that CPF of­fers.</p>
    <p>CPF IS YOUR BEST FI­NAN­CIAL AC­COUNT AF­TER 55</p>
    <p>Af­ter set­ting aside your re­tire­ment sum for CPF Life, with the ex­cep­tion of MediSave which is needed for med­i­cal ex­penses, all re­main­ing money in your OA and Spe­cial Ac­count (SA) is yours to use any­time – you can with­draw any amount and as of­ten as you like.</p>
    <p>But you should not be in a hurry to with­draw the money as there is nowhere else you can park your money at such good risk-free rates.</p>
    <p>Note that any with­drawal will come from the funds in SA first be­cause you are al­ready en­joy­ing the best re­turns by join­ing CPF Life.</p>
    <p>That said, even the OA’s 2.5 per cent should be ex­tremely at­trac­tive.</p>
    <p>If you have pre­vi­ously used your CPF to pay for your mort­gage, you should log in to myCPF, go to “My Re­quests” and un­der “Prop­erty”, se­lect “Make a hous­ing re­fund with cash”.</p>
    <p>If you are el­i­gi­ble to make such a trans­ac­tion, this is your ticket to putting your cash into the CPF and earn­ing 2.5 per cent interest.</p>
    <p>The best part? Af­ter 55, there is no min­i­mum de­posit pe­riod to earn that interest and you can with­draw the money any time.</p>
