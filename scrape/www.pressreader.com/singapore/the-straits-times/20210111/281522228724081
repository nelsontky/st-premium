    <p>In a year rav­aged by a re­ces­sion and wild swings in fi­nan­cial mar­kets, the Sin­ga­pore Ex­change (SGX) man­aged to bring in as many new com­pa­nies to list here as in 2019.</p>
    <p>The bourse at­tracted 11 ini­tial public of­fer­ings (IPOs) last year de­spite the coro­n­avirus-in­duced un­cer­tainty and mar­ket volatil­ity, ac­cord­ing to a re­port by PwC Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>The bench­mark Straits Times In­dex fell to its low­est level in more than a decade in March last year and though it re­bounded, the in­dex has yet to re­cover all its losses.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, the Sin­ga­pore econ­omy suf­fered its worst re­ces­sion last year.</p>
    <p>For last year, the com­bined pro­ceeds of Sin­ga­pore IPOs eased to $1.4 bil­lion from $3.1 bil­lion in 2019, said the PwC re­port.</p>
    <p>The num­ber of main­board list­ings in­creased to five last year from four in the pre­vi­ous year.</p>
    <p>While real es­tate i nvest­ment trusts (Reits) re­main the “star prod­uct” for SGX, three of the five main­board IPOs last year were non-Reit firms, Mr Tham Tuck Seng, who leads PwC’s cap­i­tal mar­kets team in Sin­ga­pore, told The Straits Times in an in­ter­view.</p>
    <p>That demon­strated SGX’s abil­ity to at­tract a grow­ing num­ber of com­pa­nies from across var­i­ous sec­tors de­spite the chal­leng­ing en­vi­ron­ment last year, he said.</p>
    <p>Fur­ther re­in­forc­ing Sin­ga­pore’s sta­tus as a global fi­nan­cial hub, seven of the newly listed com­pa­nies base the ma­jor­ity of their op­er­a­tions over­seas.</p>
    <p>“Given the small size of the do­mes­tic mar­ket, SGX con­tin­ues to po­si­tion it­self as an in­ter­na­tional stock ex­change as it con­tin­ues to at­tract for­eign based com­pa­nies to list here,” said Mr Tham.</p>
    <p>A large num­ber of Sin­ga­porelisted firms also have a pres­ence in for­eign mar­kets. Of the 696 listed firms at the end of Novem­ber last year, 239 were non-Sin­ga­pore com­pa­nies, ac­cord­ing to data on the SGX web­site.</p>
    <p>Mr Tham said more for­eign com­pa­nies may head to Sin­ga­pore this year, in par­tic­u­lar from health­care and tech­nol­ogy sec­tors.</p>
    <p>Still, last year’s big­gest IPO was Sin­ga­pore’s own start-up, Nanofilm Tech­nolo­gies In­ter­na­tional, which raised gross pro­ceeds – in­clud­ing the over-al­lot­ment op­tion – of about $510 mil­lion.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to Dealogic data, Nanofilm, which pro­vides nan­otech­nol­ogy solutions, was the fifth largest IPO in South-east Asia.</p>
    <p>Mr Tham said the spin-off from Nanyang Tech­no­log­i­cal Univer­sity is the first lo­cal tech­nol­ogy uni­corn to be listed on SGX and the largest non-Reit list­ing that Sin­ga­pore has seen in the past 10 years.</p>
    <p>Founded with just $400,000 by Dr Shi Xu, who moved to Sin­ga­pore from China in the early 1990s, the mar­ket cap­i­tal­i­sa­tion of Nanofilm came to about $1.7 bil­lion based on its IPO pro­ceeds.</p>
    <p>While Nanofilm was the top per­form­ing IPO last year – with its shares up 70 per cent as at Dec 31 ver­sus its of­fer price – most of the other new en­trants also fared bet­ter than ex­pected.</p>
    <p>The first day clos­ings for nine of the newly listed com­pa­nies were above their IPO prices, with only two be­low their of­fer price, the PwC re­port showed.</p>
    <p>As at Dec 31, eight of the new list­ings were trad­ing above their IPO prices, one at the IPO level and two be­low.</p>
    <p>Mr Tham said the suc­cess of Nanofilm’s IPO and its at­trac­tive val­u­a­tion could also fuel in­ter­est among lo­cal tech com­pa­nies to list here as op­posed to tak­ing the tra­di­tional route of seek­ing a list­ing in the United States or Hong Kong.</p>
    <p>Mr Tham said the trend of Sin­ga­pore com­pa­nies – mostly small and medium-sized en­ter­prises – launch­ing IPOs on the Hong Kong Stock Ex­change (HKEX) could be due to their per­cep­tion that HKEX of­fers higher val­u­a­tion and liq­uid­ity, and their de­sire to build their</p>
    <p>pres­ence in North Asia.</p>
    <p>How­ever, there was a sharp decline in such list­ings last year. Only five Sin­ga­pore com­pa­nies com­pleted their list­ings on the HKEX last year, down from 13 in 2019.</p>
    <p>The PwC re­port said the decline could be due to the po­lit­i­cal in­sta­bil­ity in Hong Kong through the sec­ond half of 2019.</p>
    <p>Also, as many smaller com­pa­nies saw their val­u­a­tions swoon amid the pan­demic, they may have put their IPO plans on ice for now.</p>
    <p>Mr Tham said four out of five of the newly listed Sin­ga­pore com­pa­nies in HKEX are trad­ing at steep dis­counts to their of­fer price.</p>
    <p>He said their poor per­for­mance may prompt many firms here to re­view their plans to take the same route.</p>
    <p>For this year, Mr Tham ex­pects IPOs from tech­nol­ogy and health­care firms to con­tinue en­joy­ing in­creased in­vestor fo­cus be­cause of their pan­demic-de­fy­ing per­for­mance last year.</p>
    <p>SGX’s suc­cess in de­vel­op­ing a global hub for Reits and busi­ness trusts here will con­tinue to at­tract more IPOs from the sec­tor, he said.</p>
    <p>How­ever, he said that fresh waves of Covid-19 cases across the world may drag the global eco­nomic re­cov­ery and in­duce mar­ket volatil­ity that may de­ter some com­pa­nies from launch­ing IPOs.</p>
    <p>“While we are see­ing signs of sta­bil­i­sa­tion, new waves of Covid-19 will add some un­cer­tainty,” he said.</p>
    <p>Still, the busi­ness model of com­pa­nies like Nanofilm will con­tinue to be at­trac­tive to in­vestors, given that dig­i­tal­i­sa­tion and the abil­ity to lever­age tech­nol­ogy to up­scale are the fo­cus in the present cli­mate, he said.</p>
    <p>For this year, Mr Tham Tuck Seng ex­pects IPOs from tech­nol­ogy and health­care firms to con­tinue en­joy­ing in­creased in­vestor fo­cus be­cause of their pan­demic-de­fy­ing per­for­mance last year. SGX’s suc­cess in de­vel­op­ing a global hub for Reits and busi­ness trusts here will con­tinue to at­tract more IPOs from the sec­tor, he said.</p>
