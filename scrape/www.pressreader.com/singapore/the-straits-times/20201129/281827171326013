    <p>The ghosts of an old scan­dal have re­turned to haunt for­mer Ja­panese prime min­is­ter Shinzo Abe, whose key aides are be­ing in­ves­ti­gated for their role in a cherry blos­som party con­tro­versy.</p>
    <p>Ques­tions were raised ear­lier this year over the bal­loon­ing bud­get and guest list for the an­nual event at the Shin­juku Na­tional Gar­den that dates back to 1952.</p>
    <p>De­spite be­ing an in­vite-only event for VIPs such as mem­bers of the di­plo­matic corps and busi­ness­men, Mr Abe had also ex­tended in­vi­ta­tions to loyal vot­ers from his con­stituency in Ya­m­aguchi pre­fec­ture in western Ja­pan.</p>
    <p>Un­der op­po­si­tion ques­tion­ing in the Diet, Mr Abe said the guest lists were shred­ded after the event and that there was no ex­ist­ing soft copy.</p>
    <p>The crim­i­nal in­ves­ti­ga­tion cen­tres on the din­ner ban­quets at fives­tar hotels that Mr Abe hosted for his guests on the eve of the sakura gar­den party event.</p>
    <p>Par­tic­i­pants were charged only 5,000 yen (S$64.30) – less than half the mar­ket rate of at least 11,000 yen per head.</p>
    <p>Mr Abe’s of­fice is sus­pected of de­fray­ing the short­fall of more than nine mil­lion yen be­tween 2013 and 2019, in what might be a vi­o­la­tion of the Po­lit­i­cal Funds Con­trol Law and Public Of­fices Elec­tion Law.</p>
    <p>The probe stems from a crim­i­nal com­plaint pe­ti­tion filed in May by about 660 lawyers and schol­ars. It was one of the top sto­ries in Ja­panese me­dia all week – sec­ond only to the Covid-19 surge that saw an­other one-day record tally of at least 2,678 cases yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>When Mr Abe was dogged by the scan­dal ear­lier this year, he de­nied in the Diet that his of­fice had made up the short­fall while in­sist­ing that no re­ceipts were ever is­sued by the hotels.</p>
    <p>But the Tokyo Prose­cu­tors’ Of­fice has ob­tained tes­ti­mony that the re­ceipts had, in fact, been is­sued to a fund man­age­ment or­gan­i­sa­tion helmed by Mr Abe.</p>
    <p>An aide has con­fessed to bin­ning the re­ceipts, in ef­fect dis­card­ing ev­i­dence that the of­fice had cov­ered part of the din­ner func­tion costs. The aide has also said that it was a mis­take not to have recorded the ex­pen­di­ture on the books.</p>
    <p>There is also the sep­a­rate is­sue of whether Mr Abe and his Chief Cabi­net Sec­re­tary Yoshi­hide Suga – now the prime min­is­ter – know­ingly lied to Par­lia­ment.</p>
    <p>A tally by the Mainichi daily showed that Mr Abe had given what might be con­sti­tuted as false state­ments at least 33 times.</p>
    <p>Op­po­si­tion leader Yukio Edano of the Con­sti­tu­tional Demo­cratic Party of Ja­pan said last week that Mr Abe was “fla­grantly ridi­cul­ing Diet de­lib­er­a­tions”.</p>
    <p>As it is, ru­mours are spread­ing in the po­lit­i­cal nerve cen­tre of Na­gat­a­cho that there may be a power strug­gle within the rul­ing Lib­eral Demo­cratic Party, given the sud­den rev­e­la­tions through source­based leaks to the me­dia over the last week.</p>
    <p>An aide has con­fessed to bin­ning the re­ceipts, in ef­fect dis­card­ing ev­i­dence that the of­fice had cov­ered part of the din­ner func­tion costs.</p>
    <p>This comes as Mr Abe be­came rel­a­tively more ac­tive in re­cent weeks since re­sign­ing as prime min­is­ter over health rea­sons in Septem­ber, lead­ing to spec­u­la­tion that he might be an­gling for an­other come­back to the top job.</p>
    <p>Mr Suga, mean­while, is fac­ing what is per­haps his sternest lead­er­ship test thus far with the third wave of Covid-19 in­fec­tions.</p>
    <p>The op­po­si­tion is also tak­ing aim at him for his role in spread­ing false­hoods through the echo­ing of Mr Abe’s state­ments over the scan­dal. Mr Suga told the Diet last week: “If the facts turn out to be dif­fer­ent, then I must, of course, take re­spon­si­bil­ity for my re­sponses.”</p>
    <p>Ja­panese me­dia across the po­lit­i­cal di­vide have been crit­i­cal. The lib­eral Asahi Shim­bun called Mr Abe’s con­duct “un­con­scionable”.</p>
    <p>The pro-govern­ment Sankei Shim­bun, cit­ing cases in Ja­panese po­lit­i­cal his­tory where sec­re­taries</p>
    <p>have been the fall guy, said: “We hope Mr Abe, as for­mer PM, can show a clean ap­pear­ance that sets him apart from the ug­li­ness of the past.”</p>
    <p>Sophia Univer­sity po­lit­i­cal sci­en­tist Koichi Nakano told The Sun­day Times that Mr Suga risks be­ing seen as a part of the cover-up if Mr Abe re­fuses to an­swer op­po­si­tion ques­tions in the Diet. “Or­di­nar­ily, politi­cians re­sign if found to do some­thing im­moral, even if not il­le­gal, but Abe brought a new po­lit­i­cal cul­ture,” he said, not­ing the string of scan­dals that oc­curred dur­ing Mr Abe’s time in of­fice.</p>
