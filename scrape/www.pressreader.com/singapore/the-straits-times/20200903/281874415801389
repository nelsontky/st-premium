    <p>•</p>
    <p>Ja­panese Chief Cab­i­net Sec­re­tary Yoshi­hide Suga de­clared yes­ter­day he would run for the lead­er­ship of the rul­ing Lib­eral Demo­cratic Party (LDP), a race he is heav­ily favoured to win to be­come the next prime minister.</p>
    <p>Mr Suga, a long­time aide to out­go­ing Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, said he was en­ter­ing the race to avert a “po­lit­i­cal vac­uum” dur­ing the pan­demic. Should he win, Mr Suga is widely ex­pected to con­tinue Mr Abe’s poli­cies of fis­cal and mon­e­tary stim­u­lus.</p>
    <p>“I thought deeply as a politi­cian and as some­body who sup­ported the Abe ad­min­is­tra­tion what I should do. As a re­sult, I made the de­ci­sion to stand as a can­di­date for the lead­er­ship of the LDP,” Mr Suga told re­porters.</p>
    <p>“In this time of na­tional cri­sis, we can­not per­mit a po­lit­i­cal vac­uum.”</p>
    <p>Mr Abe an­nounced his de­ci­sion to re­sign last week, cit­ing poor health. The LDP’s ma­jor­ity in the Lower House of Par­lia­ment will en­sure the party’s next leader will suc­ceed him as prime minister.</p>
    <p>Mr Suga has ef­fec­tively been the face of the gov­ern­ment for years as its chief spokesman. He has been</p>
    <p>close to Mr Abe for more than a decade, and was a key voice en­cour­ag­ing him to run again af­ter a dis­as­trous first term in of­fice that ended in 2007.</p>
    <p>Mr Suga’s main com­peti­tors in the Sept 14 party lead­er­ship vote are for­mer de­fence minister Shigeru Ishiba and for­mer for­eign</p>
    <p>minister Fu­mio Kishida, but Mr Suga’s po­si­tion looks strong. He has se­cured the back­ing of five of the LDP’s seven fac­tions, pub­lic broad­caster NHK and oth­ers re­ported.</p>
    <p>The party de­cided on Tues­day to hold a slimmed-down lead­er­ship elec­tion with just Mem­bers of Par­lia­ment and three votes from each</p>
    <p>of the 47 pre­fec­tures – an ad­van­tage for Mr Suga.</p>
    <p>Many party chap­ters will poll rank-and-file mem­bers to de­cide how to al­lo­cate their three votes, but ex­perts say this is un­likely to change the mo­men­tum grow­ing for Mr Suga if the mem­bers of the five fac­tions back him.</p>
    <p>Fi­nan­cial mar­kets also favour Mr Suga, as­sum­ing he will con­tinue with the re­fla­tion­ary Abe­nomics strat­egy aimed at re­viv­ing the econ­omy.</p>
    <p>The vet­eran politi­cian has re­peat­edly talked about the need to quickly bring back tourism to help re­vi­talise Ja­pan’s regional economies, which were hob­bled even be­fore the coro­n­avirus pan­demic by age­ing, shrink­ing pop­u­la­tions.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, he un­der­scored that theme again, say­ing he would push for­ward Abe­nomics poli­cies and work to help strug­gling re­gions.</p>
    <p>He voiced his readi­ness to have the cen­tral bank take ad­di­tional mon­e­tary eas­ing steps to pro­tect jobs, if he were to be­come prime minister.</p>
    <p>“We’ll look at de­vel­op­ments and if it’s necessary to pro­tect jobs, I’d like to pro­mote fur­ther mon­e­tary pol­icy (steps) be­cause the econ­omy is at a crit­i­cal junc­ture,” Mr Suga told the news con­fer­ence.</p>
    <p>Mr Suga also said he would be a con­ti­nu­ity can­di­date on the diplo­matic front, seek­ing to keep on an even keel the good ties Mr Abe nur­tured with United States Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump.</p>
    <p>He added that he would press ahead with Mr Abe’s work to re­solve a ter­ri­to­rial dis­pute with Rus­sia.</p>
