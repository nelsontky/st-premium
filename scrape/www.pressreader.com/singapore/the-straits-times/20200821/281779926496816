    <p>BRASILIA • The spread of the coro­n­avirus in Brazil could soon slow, the Health Min­istry has said, amid reports that the coun­try’s Covid-19 trans­mis­sion rate has fallen be­low a key level and early signs of a grad­ual de­cline in the weekly to­tals of in­fec­tions and fa­tal­i­ties.</p>
    <p>The cau­tious op­ti­mism comes de­spite fig­ures again show­ing a steady rise in the num­ber of cases and deaths in the last 24 hours, ce­ment­ing Brazil’s sta­tus as the world’s sec­ond-big­gest Covid-19 hot spot after the United States.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to min­istry data, Brazil has seen a drop in the weekly num­ber of new cases to 304,684 last week from a peak of 319,653 for the week end­ing July 25. The weekly death toll has fallen to 6,755 from a peak of 7,677 in the last week of July.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, a study by Imperial Col­lege Lon­don showed that for the first time since April, Brazil this week reg­is­tered a trans­mis­sion rate be­low 1. An “R rate” be­low 1 in­di­cates that each in­fected per­son will in­fect fewer than one per­son, thus curb­ing the epi­demic.</p>
    <p>“We have to see how the disease be­haves in the next two weeks to see if there is a sig­nif­i­cant drop,” Health Sur­veil­lance Sec­re­tary Ar­naldo Medeiros said on Wed­nes­day, al­though stress­ing that the ap­par­ent slow­down was no rea­son to ease up on the wear­ing of masks and so­cial dis­tanc­ing.</p>
    <p>Later on Wed­nes­day, of­fi­cial min­istry fig­ures showed 49,298 new coro­n­avirus cases and 1,212 deaths from the disease caused by the virus in the past 24 hours. Brazil has now reg­is­tered more than 3.4 mil­lion in­fec­tions and over 111,000 fa­tal­i­ties.</p>
    <p>Also on Wed­nes­day, Brazil­ian Pres­i­dent Jair Bol­sonaro en­acted a law to ex­empt schools from hav­ing to meet a min­i­mum num­ber of school days, mak­ing this aca­demic year more flex­i­ble.</p>
    <p>The new law ex­empts pri­mary and se­condary schools from hav­ing to ful­fil the manda­tory 200-day school cal­en­dar and min­i­mum 800 hours of study.</p>
    <p>But the schools will have to com­ply with the work­load re­quired by law, which is al­ready be­ing par­tially car­ried out via on­line classes.</p>
    <p>Nev­er­the­less, work­loads may be com­pleted next year at the dis­cre­tion of each school through on­line ed­u­ca­tional ac­tiv­i­ties.</p>
    <p>Schools and uni­ver­si­ties in Brazil have sus­pended in-per­son classes since March, re­plac­ing them with on­line classes, due to the coro­n­avirus pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Brazil’s north-west­ern state of Ama­zonas par­tially re­sumed in-per­son classes this week, be­com­ing the only state in the coun­try to do so thus far.</p>
    <p>In­sti­tu­tions of higher learn­ing are also ex­empt from the manda­tory 200 days of classes, but must ful­fil the study pro­gramme for each course.</p>
