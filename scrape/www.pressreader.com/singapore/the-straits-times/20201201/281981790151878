    <p>There are so­cial groups on­line for hik­ers, cam­pers, cy­clists, cook­ing en­thu­si­asts, over­seas trav­ellers, moun­taineers and many others.</p>
    <p>Peo­ple are free to join any group of their choice if they share the same in­ter­est. But more of­ten than not, the groups are run by in­di­vid­u­als who act as pros­e­cu­tor, jury and judge.</p>
    <p>They set rules that all mem­bers are ex­pected to fol­low. If the ad­min­is­tra­tor deems that you have stepped out of line, your name is deleted with­out no­tice and you can­not ques­tion why you have been kicked out of the group or ex­plain your­self.</p>
    <p>Nat­u­ral jus­tice re­quires that a per­son re­ceive a fair and un­bi­ased hear­ing be­fore a de­ci­sion is made.</p>
    <p>There must be ad­e­quate no­tice, some form of re­course and no bias.</p>
    <p>This means that any de­ci­sion, how­ever fair it may seem, is in­valid if it is made by a per­son with any in­ter­est in the out­come or any known bias that might have af­fected his im­par­tial­ity.</p>
    <p>And a de­ci­sion can­not stand un­less the per­son di­rectly af­fected by it was given a chance to state his case and to know and an­swer the other side’s case.</p>
    <p>I am dis­ap­pointed that th­ese ad­min­is­tra­tors seem to be act­ing ac­cord­ing to their whims and fan­cies.</p>
