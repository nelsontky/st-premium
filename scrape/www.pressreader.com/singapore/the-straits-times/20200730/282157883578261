    <p>A $300,000 fund has been set up to kick-start projects by young peo­ple who are big on ideas to give back to so­ci­ety, but lack the cap­i­tal to achieve their goals.</p>
    <p>And there are no lim­i­ta­tions on what they can pro­pose, said Dr Ma­liki Os­man, Min­is­ter in the Prime Min­is­ter’s Of­fice and an MP for East Coast GRC.</p>
    <p>“It can be any­thing, but they must have pas­sion,” he said, giv­ing ex­am­ples such as rais­ing en­vi­ron­men­tal aware­ness among res­i­dents or help­ing lonely se­niors in the district. “They must feel very strongly about the group they want to work with.”</p>
    <p>The pro­gramme, called Create Change @ South East, is be­ing set up by the South East Com­mu­nity De­vel­op­ment Coun­cil (CDC). This en­com­passes East Coast and Marine Pa­rade GRCs, as well as the sin­gle-seat con­stituen­cies of Mount­bat­ten and MacPher­son.</p>
    <p>It is de­signed to be a six-month scheme, with each young per­son given seed fund­ing of up to $5,000 to im­ple­ment their ideas in the district.</p>
    <p>Though the ideas must come from young peo­ple them­selves, they will be linked up with grass­roots advisers who will serve as men­tors, and get a monthly al­lowance of up to $1,000 for their time and com­mit­ment. Af­ter six months, par­tic­i­pants will take part in a sym­po­sium to share what they have learnt from the project.</p>
    <p>The CDC will work with in­sti­tutes of higher learn­ing, such as poly­tech­nics, ITE Col­lege East, and Sin­ga­pore Univer­sity of Tech­nol­ogy and De­sign to re­cruit those in­ter­ested. Ap­pli­cants do not need to be res­i­dents in the district.</p>
    <p>Dr Ma­liki, who is also Se­cond Min­is­ter for For­eign Af­fairs and Ed­u­ca­tion, was speak­ing to re­porters on the side­lines of the South East District Con­fer­ence, which was at­tended by sev­eral other MPs.</p>
    <p>Among them was Marine Pa­rade MP Fahmi Ali­man, who will suc­ceed Dr Ma­liki as mayor of the district.</p>
    <p>Dr Ma­liki said his nine-year stint was mean­ing­ful, with much done to reach out to var­i­ous seg­ments of the com­mu­nity. He said he was con­fi­dent Mr Fahmi would do an ex­cel­lent job as mayor. Mr Fahmi jok­ingly said: “The min­is­ter has as­sured me there will be a ‘war­ranty pe­riod’, so any time I have is­sues or things I need to clar­ify, he will be there.”</p>
