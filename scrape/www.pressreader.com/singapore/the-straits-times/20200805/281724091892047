    <p>The Philip­pines re­ported an­other record sin­gle-day jump in in­fec­tions yes­ter­day as new re­stric­tions took hold and peo­ple stocked up on food and cash.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day marked the first day of a new lock­down that will con­fine about 27 mil­lion peo­ple to their homes for two weeks and fur­ther strain the econ­omy.</p>
    <p>The Health Min­istry tal­lied 6,352 new cases, bring­ing the coun­try’s to­tal caseload to 112,593. By com­par­i­son, In­done­sia, which has the most num­ber of cases in South-east Asia, has 115,056 in­fec­tions.</p>
    <p>Eleven more peo­ple in the Philip­pines died, rais­ing the death toll from the pan­demic to 2,115. The coun­try is on track to pass In­done­sia to be­come the new epi­cen­tre for the pan­demic in South-east Asia.</p>
    <p>The gov­ern­ment yes­ter­day re­stored tough shel­ter-at-home re­stric­tions in Metro Manila and four densely pop­u­lated prov­inces – Bu­la­can, Rizal, La­guna and Cavite. Health work­ers had warned that the coun­try was “wag­ing a los­ing bat­tle” against the coro­n­avirus as cases spiked af­ter re­stric­tions were re­laxed in June.</p>
    <p>Overnight, check­points manned by po­lice­men, sol­diers and vil­lage watch­men were set up all over Metro Manila, home to some 12 mil­lion. These cre­ated choke points along ma­jor high­ways lead­ing to the cap­i­tal.</p>
    <p>“We had to pass through sev­eral check­points, and there was traf­fic at every check­point,” said Mr Jeremy En­car­nado, 40, who runs a food de­liv­ery busi­ness.</p>
    <p>He said sen­tries were check­ing not only for travel passes, but also proof that those pass­ing through had tested nega­tive for Covid-19. Long queues were also seen for gro­ceries and at public mar­kets and banks.</p>
    <p>Agricultur­e Sec­re­tary Wil­liam Dar said there was no need for panic buy­ing as Metro Manila will not run out of rice, veg­eta­bles, fruits and meat any time soon.</p>
    <p>In Que­zon City, Metro Manila’s largest city, the head of a task force to pro­mote dis­ci­pline caused a stir when he is­sued “shoot-to-kill” or­ders on lock­down vi­o­la­tors. He was promptly told to re­frain from is­su­ing “im­proper and il­le­gal” state­ments.</p>
    <p>Un­der the new re­stric­tions, only au­tho­rised peo­ple, in­clud­ing med­i­cal per­son­nel and work­ers in vi­tal com­pa­nies, can leave their homes.</p>
    <p>Other busi­nesses pre­vi­ously al­lowed to partly re­open, in­clud­ing bar­ber shops, In­ter­net cafes, gyms, dine-in eater­ies, and mas­sage and tat­too shops, have again been closed.</p>
    <p>Au­tho­rised com­pa­nies, in­clud­ing banks and food pro­cess­ing firms, can op­er­ate partly but need to shut­tle em­ploy­ees be­tween home and work.</p>
    <p>Work­ers can travel by bi­cy­cle, mo­tor­cy­cle and pri­vate car, but mass tran­sit is closed.</p>
    <p>Pres­i­dent Ro­drigo Duterte’s spokesman Harry Roque said the gov­ern­ment is not keen to ex­tend the lock­down be­yond two weeks. “I have to be hon­est. Our econ­omy can­not with­stand a l ong l ock­down,” he said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The econ­omy stands to lose 12 bil­lion pe­sos (S$337 mil­lion) a day dur­ing the lock­down, econ­o­mist and Marik­ina Rep­re­sen­ta­tive Stella Quimbo es­ti­mated.</p>
    <p>An­a­lysts fore­cast that the econ­omy, once Asia’s fastest-grow­ing, prob­a­bly con­tracted by at least 8 per cent, mainly be­cause of the sweep­ing lock­down from mid-March to June 1. The gov­ern­ment will re­port gross do­mes­tic prod­uct fig­ures for the sec­ond quar­ter to­mor­row.</p>
