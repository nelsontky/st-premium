    <p>Rus­sian op­po­si­tion ac­tivist Py­otr Verzilov (2018)</p>
    <p>With­out the slight­est pre­mo­ni­tion of any health is­sues, Mr Py­otr Verzilov sud­denly fell vi­o­lently ill and slipped into a coma in 2018. Mr Verzilov, known for stag­ing anti-gov­ern­ment per­for­mance art, dis­played the same mys­te­ri­ous symp­toms that struck Rus­sian op­po­si­tion politi­cian Alexei Navalny last week. “I was in ex­actly the same con­di­tion,” Mr Verzilov on Thurs­day told in­de­pen­dent Rus­sian tele­vi­sion sta­tion Rain TV of his month-long ill­ness two years ago. Mr Verzilov was kept alive on a ven­ti­la­tor and later flown to Ger­many for treat­ment. Though doc­tors found no trace of poi­son, he said he is con­vinced it was the cause and that the Krem­lin was re­spon­si­ble for it.</p>
    <p>Rus­sian spy Sergei Skri­pal and his adult daugh­ter Yu­lia (2018)</p>
    <p>Mr Sergei Skri­pal, a Rus­sian spy turned dou­ble agent for Bri­tain, was found slumped un­con­scious on a bench in the Bri­tish city of Sal­is­bury along with his adult daugh­ter Yu­lia two years ago. The au­thor­i­ties said the pair were poi­soned with the mil­i­tary-grade nerve agent Novi­chok, and they spent weeks in crit­i­cal con­di­tion. Bri­tain blamed Rus­sia for the poi­son­ing, the first known of­fen­sive use of such a nerve agent on Euro­pean soil since World War II, but Moscow de­nied in­volve­ment. Two Rus­sian men were charged in Bri­tain with the poi­son­ing.</p>
    <p>Rus­sian op­po­si­tion ac­tivist Vladimir Kara-Murza (2015, 2017)</p>
    <p>In 2015, Mr Vladimir Kara-Murza fell into a week-long coma in Moscow. He later said he be­lieved he had in­gested poi­son dur­ing the in­flight ser­vice on an Aeroflot plane. His symp­toms in­cluded swelling in his brain and kid­ney fail­ure. His wife Yev­ge­nia re­called that his arms and legs took on a bluish hue – an alarm­ing re­ac­tion to poi­son. Mr Kara-Murza said he was poi­soned and sur­vived a sec­ond at­tempt in 2017 while trav­el­ling in Rus­sia to show a doc­u­men­tary about another Rus­sian politi­cian, Mr Boris Nemtsov, who was shot and killed on a bridge in Moscow in 2015.</p>
    <p>Rus­sian op­po­si­tion jour­nal­ist Anna Politkovsk­aya (2004)</p>
    <p>In­ves­tiga­tive jour­nal­ist Anna Politkovsk­aya was also poi­soned after drink­ing a cup of tea on a do­mes­tic flight op­er­ated by another Rus­sian air­line, Karat, in 2004. She sur­vived but was shot and killed in her apart­ment el­e­va­tor two years later. Five men were sen­tenced for car­ry­ing out the killing but no one was con­victed for or­der­ing it.</p>
    <p>Ukraine’s former pres­i­dent Vik­tor A. Yushchenko (2004)</p>
    <p>Ukraine’s pro-Western former pres­i­dent Vik­tor A. Yushchenko was left with his face dis­fig­ured after be­ing poi­soned with the in­dus­trial pol­lu­tant dioxin – most likely con­cealed in a meal of boiled cray­fish. He at­trib­uted the poi­son­ing to Rus­sian agents.</p>
    <p>Rus­sian de­fec­tor Alexan­der Litvi­nenko (2006)</p>
    <p>Former KGB agent Alexan­der Litvi­nenko, who had fled to Bri­tain after de­fect­ing from Rus­sia, died in 2006 after drink­ing tea laced with polo­nium-210 at a Lon­don ho­tel. Rus­sian Pres­i­dent Vladimir Putin prob­a­bly ap­proved the killing, a Bri­tish in­quiry con­cluded in 2016. The in­quiry found that a former KGB body­guard and another Rus­sian had car­ried out the killing, prob­a­bly di­rected by Rus­sia’s Fed­eral Se­cu­rity Ser­vice, the main heir to the Soviet-era KGB. Moscow de­nied in­volve­ment.</p>
