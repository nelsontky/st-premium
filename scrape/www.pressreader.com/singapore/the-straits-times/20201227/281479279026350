    <p>A pri­vate hos­pi­tal here that spe­cialises in can­cer treat­ment has been or­dered to tem­po­rar­ily stop pro­vid­ing all health­care ser­vices since Dec 19, af­ter in­spec­tions by the Min­istry of Health (MOH) found sev­eral sig­nif­i­cant lapses af­fect­ing pa­tient safety.</p>
    <p>MOH yesterday said in­spec­tions it car­ried out be­tween Dec 14 and Dec 16 at Con­cord In­ter­na­tional Hos­pi­tal (CIH) found that the hos­pi­tal in Adam Road had failed to abide by the Pri­vate Hos­pi­tals and Med­i­cal Clin­ics (PHMC) Act.</p>
    <p>“Mul­ti­ple life-sav­ing equip­ment and med­i­ca­tions were ei­ther not main­tained or not avail­able in crit­i­cal ar­eas of the hos­pi­tal such as the in­ten­sive care unit and the op­er­at­ing theatre,” said the min­istry.</p>
    <p>“There was also a lack of qual­ity con­trol in the lab­o­ra­tory and in­fec­tion con­trol pro­cesses, which poses sig­nif­i­cant risks to pa­tient safety and well-be­ing.”</p>
    <p>It added that as of Dec 19, CIH had on­go­ing out­pa­tient med­i­cal ap­point­ments with four pa­tients.</p>
    <p>There were no pa­tients warded at the hos­pi­tal. Ac­cord­ing to a 2018 report, it has 31 beds.</p>
    <p>MOH has in­formed CIH to work with its med­i­cal team to re­view the treat­ment plans and en­sure proper con­ti­nu­ity of out­pa­tient care for the four pa­tients, while the hos­pi­tal ad­dresses its lapses.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, those who in­tend to seek med­i­cal care at the hos­pi­tal are ad­vised to do so at other li­censed health­care fa­cil­i­ties.</p>
    <p>CIH was one of the pri­vate hos­pi­tals roped in by MOH in March to help care for Covid-19 pa­tients who were clin­i­cally well but tested pos­i­tive for the virus.</p>
    <p>Other pri­vate hos­pi­tals that were tapped to help re­duce the strain on the pub­lic health­care sys­tem in­cluded Mount El­iz­a­beth Hos­pi­tal and Gleneagles Hos­pi­tal.</p>
    <p>MOH did not say whether the lapses at CIH were re­lated to the han­dling of Covid-19 pa­tients.</p>
    <p>The min­istry re­minded all health­care fa­cil­i­ties li­censed un­der the PHMC Act to en­sure that safety and qual­ity of clin­i­cal care are met at all times. Health­care fa­cil­i­ties that fail to com­ply with the Act could face a fine of up to $20,000 and/or have their li­cence re­voked.</p>
    <p>MOH added that health­care fa­cil­i­ties will be li­censed un­der a new Health­care Ser­vices Act from the sec­ond half of next year.</p>
    <p>The new Act will fur­ther strengthen reg­u­la­tory con­form­ity across var­i­ous health­care ser­vices to en­sure con­tin­ued de­liv­ery of safe care to pa­tients, said MOH.</p>
    <p>Pre­vi­ously known as For­tis Sur­gi­cal Hos­pi­tal, the hos­pi­tal was ac­quired by China-head­quar­tered Con­cord Med­i­cal Ser­vices Hold­ings (CCM) in April 2015 in a $55 mil­lion cash deal.</p>
    <p>CCM chief ex­ec­u­tive Yang Jianyu said then that the hos­pi­tal would be an ex­ten­sion of the health­care provider’s over­seas busi­ness, with plans for it to be a “high-end med­i­cal treat­ment in­sti­tu­tion... for pa­tients com­ing from China, who cur­rently are seek­ing over­seas treat­ment”.</p>
    <p>CIH could not be reached for com­ment, and its web­site was down last night.</p>
