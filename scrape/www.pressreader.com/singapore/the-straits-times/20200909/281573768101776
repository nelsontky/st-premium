    <p>De­spite its prob­lems, it is wrong to com­pare Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump’s Amer­ica to Ger­many’s Weimar Repub­lic that led to the rise of Adolf Hitler, says his­to­rian Niall Fer­gu­son.</p>
    <p>“Life is a cabaret, old chum,” sang Sally Bowles in the mu­si­cal based on Christo­pher Ish­er­wood’s novel Berlin Sto­ries. I sus­pect the movie ver­sion, Cabaret, which won Liza Min­nelli the Os­car for best ac­tress, is the near­est older Amer­i­cans ever got to the Weimar Repub­lic.</p>
    <p>Still, it’s not a bad place to start, if you want to talk Weimar and its rel­e­vance to US Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump’s Amer­ica. From the camp deca­dence of the Kit Kat Klub to the chill­ing ren­di­tion of To­mor­row Be­longs To Me by the blond</p>
    <p>Hitler Youth in the beer gar­den, Cabaret (1972) pro­vides the es­sen­tials: a dis­eased democ­racy, swept away by the ir­re­sistible temp­ta­tions of eth­nic na­tion­al­ism, po­lit­i­cal vi­o­lence and dem­a­gogy.</p>
    <p>Amer­ica’s found­ing fa­thers knew their an­cient and mod­ern his­tory.</p>
    <p>They un­der­stood very well the ten­dency for re­publics to slide into tyranny – hence Ben­jamin Franklin’s sup­posed re­ply to the anx­ious lady who asked him which form of gov­ern­ment the Con­sti­tu­tional Con­ven­tion of 1787 had de­cided on: “A repub­lic, if you can keep it.”</p>
    <p>Yet no ex­am­ple known to Franklin’s gen­er­a­tion could match the Weimar Repub­lic as a warn­ing from his­tory. That is why, within a few years of its col­lapse in 1933, Amer­i­cans had adopted Weimar as their very own night­mare sce­nario.</p>
    <p>WEIMERICA IN FIC­TION</p>
    <p>Sin­clair Lewis’ 1935 novel and play It Can’t Hap­pen Here launched the genre we might call “Weimerica”.</p>
    <p>In­spired by his wife Dorothy Thomp­son’s ex­pe­ri­ences as a for­eign cor­re­spon­dent in Ger­many, and her ob­ser­va­tion of the am­bi­tious and charis­matic Louisiana sen­a­tor Huey Long, Lewis imag­ined the sud­den col­lapse of the New Deal and the ad­vent, un­der the dic­ta­to­rial lead­er­ship of the bom­bas­tic Berzelius “Buzz” Win­drip, of an Amer­i­can Third Re­ich.</p>
    <p>Win­drip’s ide­ol­ogy, de­vised with the as­sis­tance of his Goebbels-like press sec­re­tary, Lee Sara­son, is The Fif­teen Points Of Vic­tory For The For­got­ten Men.</p>
    <p>They form “a na­tion­wide league of Win­drip march­ing-clubs, to be called the Minute Men”, and a five-pointed star as their swastika.</p>
    <p>The Con­sti­tu­tion is swept aside, the free market re­placed by a cor­rupt cor­po­ratism, the free press sti­fled. Dark­ness de­scends.</p>
    <p>Weimerica has re­curred in dystopian fic­tion: in Stephen King’s The Run­ning Man (1982), Mar­garet At­wood’s The Hand­maid’s Tale (1985), Philip Roth’s The Plot Against Amer­ica (2004) and Suzanne Collins’ The Hunger Games (2008).</p>
    <p>In each case, although the fo­cus is on life in a fas­cist Amer­ica, there is a ver­sion of the Weimar back story, for with­out the de­gen­er­a­tion of the repub­lic, the rise of the dic­ta­tor­ship is in­ex­pli­ca­ble.</p>
    <p>So when my old friend An­drew Sul­li­van urged us last month “to be frank” about re­cent de­vel­op­ments in Amer­i­can pol­i­tics and ad­mit that it is all “very Weimar”, he was adding to an 85-year-old tra­di­tion. “The cen­tre has col­lapsed,” Mr Sul­li­van wrote. “Armed street gangs of far right and far left are at war on the streets. Trib­al­ism is in­ten­si­fy­ing in ev­ery nook and cranny of the cul­ture. The es­tab­lish­ment right and main­stream left tol­er­ate their re­spec­tive ex­tremes be­cause they hate each other so much.”</p>
    <p>The prob­lem with Weimerica is that we’ve imag­ined it too many times. Colum­nist Roger Co­hen beat Mr Sul­li­van to the punch with a</p>
    <p>New York Times piece in De­cem­ber 2015. “Wel­come to Weimar Amer­ica,” wrote Mr Co­hen. “Wel­come to an an­gry na­tion stung by two lost wars, its pol­i­tics veer­ing to the ex­tremes, its mood venge­ful, be­set by decades of stag­nant real wages for most peo­ple, tempted by a strong­man who would keep all Mus­lims out and vows to re­store Amer­i­can great­ness.”</p>
    <p>In March 2016, his­to­rian Eric Weitz ar­gued that the real les­son of Weimar was the dan­ger that arises “when tra­di­tional or mod­er­ate con­ser­va­tives throw in their lot with... anti-demo­cratic, rad­i­cal con­ser­va­tives”, ren­der­ing them re­spectable – or, as the Ger­mans would say, sa­lon­fae­hig.</p>
    <p>Note, how­ever, that Weimerica is not an es­pe­cially left-wing idea.</p>
    <p>Nor is Weimerica an idea con­fined to Amer­i­can com­men­tary. Bri­tish and Rus­sian schol­ars have drawn sim­i­lar analo­gies. Yet no amount of rep­e­ti­tion will erase the enor­mous dif­fer­ences be­tween the US of to­day and the Ger­many of 90 years ago. Not many peo­ple are left who re­mem­ber the orig­i­nal Weimar Repub­lic, born in 1919 af­ter the revo­lu­tion­ary ouster of Kaiser Wil­helm II and con­demned to death 14 years later with Hitler’s ap­point­ment as chan­cel­lor.</p>
    <p>I asked re­cently one emi­nent Amer­i­can who was born in Ger­many in 1923 what he thought.</p>
    <p>It was a par­al­lel that had crossed Dr Henry Kissinger’s mind more than once in the tur­bu­lent times of the late 1960s and early 1970s.</p>
    <p>His view to­day: Amer­i­cans are “nowhere near as alien­ated from their demo­cratic sys­tem” as Ger­mans in the 1920s.</p>
    <p>SEVEN REA­SONS WHY</p>
    <p>As a cer­ti­fied Weimar scholar</p>
    <p>(it was the sub­ject of my PhD dis­ser­ta­tion), I can think of at least seven rea­sons why that is right. Let’s start with po­lit­i­cal vi­o­lence. Yes, we have seen too much of that in the US this year, most re­cently in Port­land, Ore­gon, and Kenosha, Wis­con­sin. And yet there is a huge dif­fer­ence be­tween the chaotic scenes we have wit­nessed in those and other lo­ca­tions and the Ger­man street bat­tles of the early 1930s. As a high pro­por­tion of adult Ger­man men had served in World War I, the paramil­i­tary forces such as the Nazi Sturmabtei­lung and the Com­mu­nist Rot­fron­tkampfer­bund were not only uni­formed and (up to a point) dis­ci­plined, they were also com­pe­tent at vi­o­lence in a way that to­day’s An­tifa and Proud Boy types man­i­festly are not.</p>
    <p>In the early years of the Weimar Repub­lic, so-called Freiko­rps of de­mo­bilised but not dis­armed sol­diers es­sen­tially car­ried on the war on the East­ern Front. The Or­gan­i­sa­tion Con­sul, a right-wing paramil­i­tary, was re­spon­si­ble for more than 350 as­sas­si­na­tions of demo­cratic politi­cians, in­clud­ing then Fi­nance Min­is­ter Matthias Erzberger and For­eign Min­is­ter Walther Ra­thenau.</p>
    <p>Sec­ond, his­to­ri­ans of the left have tended to ar­gue that Hitler did not seize power but was handed it by Ger­many’s fun­da­men­tally con­ser­va­tive elites, who never ac­cepted the revo­lu­tion­ary tran­si­tion to democ­racy that had hap­pened in 1918-1919.</p>
    <p>It is cer­tainly true that by the early 1930s, there was sub­stan­tial sup­port for the Nazis in the mil­i­tary, the se­nior civil ser­vice and the uni­ver­si­ties. To­day’s Amer­i­can elites are quite dif­fer­ent.</p>
    <p>You will look in vain for strong pro-Trump sen­ti­ment in the Amer­i­can of­fi­cer corps and, in­deed, in the mil­i­tary more gen­er­ally.</p>
    <p>To an ex­tent, that is baf­fling. Mr Trump has re­peat­edly ex­pressed his con­tempt for mar­tial val­ues in gen­eral and dis­tin­guished Amer­i­can veter­ans in par­tic­u­lar.</p>
    <p>We knew this al­ready from his sneer­ing at the late sen­a­tor John McCain in 2015, but The At­lantic’s edi­tor-in-chief Jef­frey Gold­berg vividly re­minded us of it re­cently.</p>
    <p>In the an­nals of all his­tory, never mind Ger­man his­tory, it is hard to think of a would-be tyrant in­tent on over­throw­ing a repub­li­can Con­sti­tu­tion who re­ferred to the fallen in past con­flicts as “losers” and “suck­ers”, and re­port­edly asked a war hero’s fa­ther, a mem­ber of his own Cab­i­net: “What was in it for them?”</p>
    <p>But then, as jour­nal­ist and au­thor Matt Taibbi pointed out last week, Mr Trump isn’t a would-be tyrant. He’s a rene­gade snake-oil sales­man who dis­cov­ered that the shame­less self-mar­ket­ing tech­niques he’d de­vel­oped in real es­tate and re­al­ity tele­vi­sion could be de­ployed to dev­as­tat­ing ef­fect in pol­i­tics.</p>
    <p>And if you think the gen­er­als hate Mr Trump, they’ve got noth­ing on pro­fes­sional civil ser­vants, who in turn have got noth­ing on univer­sity pro­fes­sors.</p>
    <p>Fact: Mrs Hil­lary Clin­ton got 91 per cent of the votes in the Dis­trict of Columbia in 2016. The num­bers of Har­vard, Prince­ton and Yale fac­ulty mem­bers who voted for Mr Trump must have been in the sin­gle dig­its, which per­haps ex­plains why the Prince­ton Elec­tion Con­sor­tium thought Mrs Clin­ton had a 93 per cent chance of vic­tory on the eve of the elec­tion. It re­ally, re­ally wasn’t like this in Ger­many in 1932.</p>
    <p>THE ECON­OMY AND PARTY POL­I­TICS</p>
    <p>Here’s a third rea­son. Yes, the US econ­omy has suf­fered three re­ces­sions in the past 20 years, with un­em­ploy­ment ex­ceed­ing 10 per cent in two of them.</p>
    <p>But in­fla­tion has been so low that the Fed­eral Re­serve can’t hit a 2 per cent in­fla­tion tar­get.</p>
    <p>Com­pare and con­trast: The Weimar Repub­lic suf­fered one of the worst hy­per­in­fla­tion episodes in all of fi­nan­cial his­tory in 1922-1923. It then suf­fered one of the worst de­fla­tion episodes be­tween 1929 and 1933.</p>
    <p>Un­em­ploy­ment rose to 24 per cent in early 1932 and re­mained above 20 per cent into 1933.</p>
    <p>Hav­ing de­stroyed the cur­rency with ram­pant deficit fi­nance and money print­ing in the early 1920s, pol­i­cy­mak­ers felt un­able to off­set the ex­ter­nal shock of the Great De­pres­sion in the ways that US gov­ern­ments have been able to mit­i­gate the ef­fects of the fi­nan­cial cri­sis af­ter 2008 and this year’s coro­n­avirus pan­demic.</p>
    <p>The fourth rea­son why I don’t be­lieve we’re look­ing at Weimerica: Un­like al­most ev­ery other democ­racy in the world, the US re­tains the two-party sys­tem that it im­ported from Bri­tain. The his­tory of party pol­i­tics in the Weimar Repub­lic was just the op­po­site. Thanks to a sys­tem of pro­por­tional rep­re­sen­ta­tion, there were mul­ti­ple par­ties from the out­set, and their num­ber only in­creased in the wake of the hy­per­in­fla­tion.</p>
    <p>A to­tal of 41 par­ties con­tested the May 1928 fed­eral elec­tion.</p>
    <p>This frag­men­ta­tion in the mid-1920s was then fol­lowed by a ter­ri­fy­ing con­sol­i­da­tion of sup­port for ex­plic­itly anti-demo­cratic par­ties: the Nazis and the com­mu­nists. In July 1932, the two to­gether won more than half the pop­u­lar vote.</p>
    <p>One key to the Nazis’ suc­cess was that they mopped up sup­port from most of the splin­ter par­ties of 1928.</p>
    <p>Fifth: The Weimar Con­sti­tu­tion was very novel. It had been drafted in the revo­lu­tion­ary con­fu­sion of 1919 and had a num­ber of se­ri­ous struc­tural weak­nesses, no­tably Ar­ti­cle 48, which al­lowed the di­rectly elected pres­i­dent of the repub­lic to rule by de­cree in an emer­gency, by­pass­ing Par­lia­ment, or Re­ich­stag. Say what you like about Amer­i­can pol­i­tics, the Con­sti­tu­tion of 1787 has stood the test of time and its defin­ing fea­ture re­mains the lim­its it places on the ex­ec­u­tive branch.</p>
    <p>IN­TER­NA­TIONAL EN­VI­RON­MENT</p>
    <p>The sixth and per­haps most im­por­tant dif­fer­ence be­tween Weimar and the US to­day lies in the in­ter­na­tional cir­cum­stances. The Weimar Repub­lic came into ex­is­tence be­cause Ger­many lost World War I and the vic­to­ri­ous Al­lies re­fused to ne­go­ti­ate with rep­re­sen­ta­tives of the old im­pe­rial regime, in­tent as they were on blam­ing the war on the kaiser and his min­is­ters. That no­tion of “war guilt” was the ba­sis of the vast repa­ra­tions debt en­vis­aged in the Treaty of Ver­sailles and de­ter­mined in the London Ul­ti­ma­tum of 1921.</p>
    <p>The le­git­i­macy of all three el­e­ments of the new or­der – de­feat, repub­lic and repa­ra­tions – was sim­ply never ac­cepted by a sig­nif­i­cant pro­por­tion of the Ger­man pop­u­la­tion.</p>
    <p>By com­par­i­son, the US to­day faces noth­ing more than the nor­mal headaches of be­ing the world’s big­gest econ­omy and dom­i­nant geopo­lit­i­cal power.</p>
    <p>As in the 1930s, many Amer­i­cans dis­like hav­ing to con­tend with prob­lems in far­away places of which they know lit­tle. In their dif­fer­ent ways, both Mr Trump and his pre­de­ces­sor Barack Obama of­fered a re­treat from the quasi-im­pe­rial am­bi­tions of the neo­con­ser­va­tives in the ad­min­is­tra­tion of pres­i­dent Ge­orge W. Bush. But the rise of China has made a re­treat into iso­la­tion­ism less and less likely, even if that is Mr Trump’s ba­sic in­stinct.</p>
    <p>Which brings us back, last but not least, to Mr Trump, whose world view and po­lit­i­cal style are so much closer to vin­tage Amer­i­can na­tivism and pop­ulism that I have the ut­most dif­fi­culty un­der­stand­ing why any ed­u­cated per­son would liken him to Hitler.</p>
    <p>You don’t need the Weimar Repub­lic to ex­plain the ap­peal to many Amer­i­can vot­ers of im­mi­gra­tion re­stric­tion, tar­iffs and a cul­ture war di­rected against a “glob­al­ist” elite.</p>
    <p>That recipe is the essence of Amer­i­can pop­ulism. It has al­most noth­ing in com­mon with in­ter-war Ger­man fas­cism, which was about racial per­se­cu­tion and ul­ti­mately an­ni­hi­la­tion, eco­nomic au­tarky and ac­tual war (hence all the uni­forms and jack­boots). That is not to say that we have noth­ing at all to learn from the Ger­many of a cen­tury ago.</p>
    <p>A POST-WE­BER WORLD</p>
    <p>Not many peo­ple are left who re­mem­ber the orig­i­nal Weimar Repub­lic, born in 1919 af­ter the revo­lu­tion­ary ouster of Kaiser Wil­helm II and con­demned to death 14 years later with Hitler’s ap­point­ment as chan­cel­lor. I asked re­cently one emi­nent Amer­i­can who was born in Ger­many in 1923 what he thought... His view to­day: Amer­i­cans are “nowhere near as alien­ated from their demo­cratic sys­tem” as Ger­mans in the 1920s.</p>
    <p>Among the authors of the Weimar Con­sti­tu­tion was Max We­ber, the great so­ci­ol­o­gist.</p>
    <p>I have been think­ing a lot this year about We­ber’s vi­sion of moder­nity – of a world “de­mys­ti­fied” by the ad­vance of sci­ence, of an econ­omy lib­er­ated from the “cage” of the Protes­tant ethic, of busi­ness and gov­ern­ment run on the “ra­tio­nal-le­gal” ba­sis of bu­reau­cracy, of aca­demic life as a “vo­ca­tion” that should be di­vorced from pol­i­tics.</p>
    <p>The Con­sti­tu­tion which We­ber helped draft did not last long. His vi­sion of moder­nity, by con­trast, was largely ful­filled in much of the world in the course of the 20th cen­tury.</p>
    <p>In­creas­ingly, I think, we are leav­ing that We­be­rian moder­nity be­hind. In the new post-We­ber world, mag­i­cal think­ing is erod­ing the supremacy of sci­ence, a ver­sion of the Protes­tant ethic of work and thrift has been rein­car­nated in East Asia, cor­po­rate and bu­reau­cratic gov­er­nance is yield­ing to charis­matic lead­er­ship (think Tesla chief ex­ec­u­tive Elon Musk as much as Mr Trump), and academia is be­ing politi­cised to death.</p>
    <p>But th­ese are global trends. They have lit­tle, if any­thing, to do with Weimar. Godwin’s Law</p>
    <p>(for­mu­lated by Amer­i­can at­tor­ney and au­thor Mike Godwin in 1990) states that “as an on­line dis­cus­sion con­tin­ues, the prob­a­bil­ity of a ref­er­ence or com­par­i­son to Hitler or Nazis ap­proaches 1”.</p>
    <p>In one of our vit­ri­olic de­bates dur­ing the fi­nan­cial cri­sis – it was in Seoul in 2010 – econ­o­mist Paul Krug­man pro­posed “a macroe­co­nomic ver­sion of Godwin’s Law: The first per­son to bring up the Weimar hy­per­in­fla­tion is con­sid­ered to have lost the de­bate”. This did not pre­vent him, five years later, from bring­ing up the Weimar de­fla­tion of 1930-1932 to tram­ple on ar­gu­ments for aus­ter­ity in Greece.</p>
    <p>Pro­fes­sor Krug­man should have stuck to his own rule. Just as the euro zone cri­sis did not drive Greek democ­racy over the brink – on the con­trary, Greece now has one of the best cen­tre-right gov­ern­ments in Europe – so, too, Amer­ica seems likely to sur­vive its lat­est brush with the Weimar anal­ogy.</p>
    <p>Life, it turns out, isn’t al­ways Cabaret. Whether the world as a whole can sur­vive this new, post-We­be­rian era is an­other ques­tion.</p>
