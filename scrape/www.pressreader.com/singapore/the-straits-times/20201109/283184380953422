    <p>I highlight my work­ers’ good safety prac­tices to their peers to en­sure that their ef­forts are recog­nised and ap­pre­ci­ated, and to en­cour­age ev­ery­one to learn from one an­other.”</p>
    <p>PROJECT ED­I­TOR Michelle Bong Le­jtenyi STO­RY­TELLERS (9620-1355), Ly­dia Lim (9693-0086)</p>
    <p>We stay safe to­gether. Safety as a way of life is a cul­tural mind­set that can be in­grained and built upon over the years.”</p>
    <p>On the im­por­tance of good com­mu­ni­ca­tion skills and cul­tural sen­si­tiv­ity...</p>
    <p>“This is im­por­tant since multi-eth­nic work­ers from dif­fer­ent trades come to­gether when work­ing on a project.</p>
    <p>“At our daily tool­box meet­ing, I make it a point to en­sure that all my work­ers thor­oughly un­der­stand their work scope and the risks in­volved. I get them to share tips and ad­vice re­gard­ing health and safety. And to as­sess their un­der­stand­ing of the work pro­ce­dures and risk as­sess­ments briefed, I ask them to de­scribe the se­quences in de­tail to check for any miss­ing points. I also ask them to ex­plain pro­cesses in their na­tive tongues to other work­ers who have dif­fi­cul­ties un­der­stand­ing Eng­lish.”</p>
    <p>On strong lead­er­ship skills and be­ing a role model who mo­ti­vates and in­spires...</p>
    <p>“While I con­duct reg­u­lar checks and su­per­vise high-risk ac­tiv­i­ties, it is im­pos­si­ble for me to keep an eye on ev­ery sin­gle worker at the same time. I have to make sure that my work­ers keep safety at the top of their minds, and not only con­duct due dili­gence with re­gard to their own safety, but also that of oth­ers around them, even in the ab­sence of a su­per­vi­sor.</p>
    <p>“I highlight my work­ers’ good safety prac­tices to their peers to en­sure that their ef­forts are recog­nised and ap­pre­ci­ated, and to en­cour­age ev­ery­one to learn from one an­other. I al­ways re­mind them that they are re­spon­si­ble to stop work when­ever they spot pos­si­ble dan­gers dur­ing op­er­a­tions. They should sound off to me when­ever they spot any po­ten­tial haz­ards dur­ing site sur­veys be­fore work starts, and use pro­vided QR codes to re­port on any health and safety haz­ards they come across around the yard.”</p>
