    <p>The Covid-19 pan­demic has high­lighted im­por­tant truths for Sin­ga­pore, in­clud­ing the need to come to grips with the is­sue of mi­grant work­ers, said Pro­fes­sor Chan Heng Chee in a lec­ture yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>With their large num­bers and dense liv­ing con­di­tions pos­ing risks dur­ing pan­demics, Sin­ga­pore has to re-ex­am­ine how fast it can shift its paradigm of eco­nomic growth away from the cur­rent man­power-re­liant model to­wards greater use of tech­nol­ogy, said Prof Chan.</p>
    <p>She added that the liv­ing and work­ing con­di­tions of the work­ers – an is­sue that has been con­sis­tently high­lighted by civil so­ci­ety – need to be im­proved. “We can and must do much bet­ter,” said Prof Chan in the last of a se­ries of three lec­tures as the In­sti­tute of Pol­icy Stud­ies’ 7th S R Nathan Fel­low.</p>
    <p>On a more op­ti­mistic note, she said the pan­demic has also demon­strated that Sin­ga­pore has be­come a kinder na­tion, with many com­ing for­ward to help vul­ner­a­ble groups. And while the Gov­ern­ment had faced crit­i­cisms over the ex­plo­sion of Covid-19 cases among for­eign work­ers, it has done well in its han­dling of the pan­demic and man­aged to keep the Covid-19 death rate low, she added.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore also kept sup­ply chains open dur­ing the cri­sis, and food im­ports were not dis­rupted dur­ing the global lock­down in the last few months, she noted.</p>
    <p>“We must think through the l es­sons of this (Covid-19) dis­rup­tion for ur­ban life and our eco­nomic life,” Prof Chan said, adding that the pan­demic has been a wake-up call for all cit­i­zens to put health se­cu­rity as a top pri­or­ity, with food se­cu­rity fol­low­ing closely. It is para­mount for Sin­ga­pore, which is with­out a hin­ter­land, to en­sure the con­ti­nu­ity of all its sup­ply chains.</p>
    <p>Go­ing for­ward, the pan­demic may well slow the move­ment of peo­ple for a few years, and it may be­come po­lit­i­cally un­sus­tain­able to main­tain a huge in­take of for­eign­ers in the pop­u­la­tion, said Prof Chan. She noted that the Gov­ern­ment has been mod­er­at­ing the pace of im­mi­gra­tion, and that a nat­u­ral at­tri­tion in the num­ber of for­eign work­ers will come with the re­ces­sion.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore must also in­vest more to strengthen small and medium-sized en­ter­prises (SMEs), star­tups and gig econ­omy work­ers, she said. While new schemes have been launched to help SMEs, some find it dif­fi­cult to take ad­van­tage of the help avail­able. The bu­reau­cracy has to en­sure that as­sis­tance is given in a timely and help­ful man­ner, she added.</p>
    <p>On the geopo­lit­i­cal front, Prof Chan said Sin­ga­pore feels the “pres­sure and tug of war” be­tween the two global pow­ers, China and the United States. Like other coun­tries in Europe and Asia, Sin­ga­pore does not want to make a bi­nary choice be­tween de­vel­op­ing a re­la­tion­ship with ei­ther power, she said.</p>
    <p>Nor does it have to do so for now, she added. For the next decade or two, Sin­ga­pore will con­tinue to see the US as its pre­ferred strate­gic and de­fence part­ner or friend in Asia, if the US is not seen to be re­trench­ing its in­ter­ests. China will also emerge as the im­por­tant and sought-af­ter eco­nomic part­ner, and in­creas­ingly as a tech­nol­ogy part­ner, she said.</p>
    <p>“We should not make a choice for as long as we can. Choice will be ex­er­cised by each coun­try, to line up with the US or China, de­pend­ing on what ini­tia­tives the two pow­ers put on the ta­ble.”</p>
