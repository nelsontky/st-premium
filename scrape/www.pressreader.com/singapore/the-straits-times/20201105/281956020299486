    <p>It is a well-worn say­ing that while most na­tions have an army, in Pak­istan, the army has a na­tion.</p>
    <p>Born as a na­tion for Mus­lims after the blood-soaked par­ti­tion of the Indian sub-con­ti­nent in 1947, and hos­til­i­ties with larger In­dia start­ing al­most im­me­di­ately over the con­tested Kash­mir re­gion, Pak­istan is a coun­try where the mil­i­tary has al­ways had an out­size role in na­tional af­fairs.</p>
    <p>Pe­ri­od­i­cally, the army has stepped in to take di­rect con­trol when it be­lieved that politi­cians have messed up way too much. Each stint of mil­i­tary rule – Field Mar­shal Ayub Khan’s in the 1958-1969 pe­riod, Gen­eral Yahya Khan’s be­tween 1969-1971 when Pak­istan lost its east­ern wing, then Gen­eral Mohammed Zia-ul-Haq’s time as ruler be­tween 1977-1988, and Gen­eral Pervez Mushar­raf’s be­tween 1999-2007 – has ended with the mil­i­tary hand­ing back power to civil­ians.</p>
    <p>For all that, the Pak­istani mil­i­tary is re­spected for its pro­fes­sion­al­ism and its spy agency, the In­ter-Ser­vices In­tel­li­gence (ISI), con­sid­ered one of the finest in the trade. It has also proved a dab hand at in­flu­enc­ing do­mes­tic pol­i­tics.</p>
    <p>The rise to power of cur­rent Prime Min­is­ter Im­ran Khan in 2018, whose Pak­istan Tehreek-e-In­saf party sim­ply did not have the pull power of the na­tion’s two largest po­lit­i­cal groups – the Pak­istan Mus­lim League (founded by for­mer prime min­is­ter Nawaz Sharif) and the Pak­istan Peo­ples Party (PPP) of the Bhutto-Zardari clan – was widely seen as army-or­ches­trated.</p>
    <p>What’s more, what was once a force dom­i­nated by a sin­gle prov­ince – Pun­jab – has, over the years, turned into a truly rep­re­sen­ta­tive na­tional in­sti­tu­tion. Be­sides, it is widely known that the army keeps the nu­clear but­ton, not the civil­ian lead­er­ship.</p>
    <p>For all these rea­sons, Pak­istan’s gen­er­als han­dle their po­lit­i­cal mas­ters with far more aplomb than most of their peers in Asia. In­deed, they carry a spe­cial swag­ger as stew­ards of an in­sti­tu­tion seen as be­yond re­proach, cer­tainly not pub­licly.</p>
    <p>Last month, though, three-time for­mer prime min­is­ter Sharif did what many thought was the un­think­able. Speak­ing from Lon­don, where he lives in a sort of med­i­cal ex­ile after be­ing bounced out of of­fice three years ago, he ad­dressed a large gath­er­ing as­sem­bled in the city of Gu­jran­wala by the Pak­istan Democ­racy Move­ment (PDM), an 11-party um­brella coali­tion that in­cludes the na­tion’s big­gest par­ties, in­clud­ing his own and the PPP.</p>
    <p>Politi­cians love a crowd and through his video link, Mr Sharif could prob­a­bly see this was a large one. After two years of tepid growth fol­lowed by the coro­n­avirus out­break, the economy is in dan­ger­ous wa­ters. Jobs are be­ing shed at dizzy­ing speed and in­fla­tion is run­ning high.</p>
    <p>TOUGH TIMES FOR IM­RAN KHAN</p>
    <p>While Prime Min­is­ter Khan, a for­mer cricket hero, re­tains pop­u­lar­ity on a per­sonal level and is gen­er­ally thought to be clean, there is lit­tle doubt that hard­ship has wors­ened un­der his ad­min­is­tra­tion of Pak­istan.</p>
    <p>Ques­tions also are be­ing asked about the China-Pak­istan Eco­nomic Cor­ri­dor (CPEC), a cor­ner­stone of Bei­jing’s Belt and Road Ini­tia­tive, amid fears that it is leading Pak­istan into a debt trap. The re­tired three-star gen­eral in charge of the CPEC for Pak­istan re­cently had to quit some key gov­ern­ment po­si­tions, in­clud­ing Spe­cial As­sis­tant to the PM, over graft charges.</p>
    <p>All that is fer­tile ground for a swell of dis­con­tent and the PDM has made full use of it, ex­plain­ing the num­bers it is able to gather for its ral­lies such as the one Mr Sharif was view­ing from Lon­don.</p>
    <p>Into the 17th minute of his ram­bling ad­dress, Mr Sharif be­gan riff­ing with the crowd. “Who will you blame?” he asked his au­di­ence. “Im­ran Ni­azi, or the peo­ple who brought him?”</p>
    <p>For added ef­fect, he re­peated the ques­tion, stress­ing on “Ni­azi”, be­fore go­ing on to call out army chief, Gen­eral Qa­mar Ba­jwa, and ISI head, Lieu­tenant-Gen­eral Faiz Hameed, for fab­ri­cat­ing con­spir­acy charges against op­po­si­tion lead­ers. He also ac­cused them of or­ches­trat­ing his re­moval from of­fice in 2017 and engi­neer­ing Mr Khan’s election the fol­low­ing year.</p>
    <p>In time to come, this will be re­mem­bered as a wa­ter­shed mo­ment for Pak­istan, a key turn in the road as wit­nessed this year in Thai­land where the revered monar­chy has come un­der un­prece­dented crit­i­cism.</p>
    <p>Ace politi­cian as he is, Mr Sharif was killing two birds here with a sin­gle dart – the Pak­istan army that backs Mr Khan, and, by re­fer­ring to him by his full name Im­ran Khan Ni­azi, rais­ing mem­o­ries of Pak­istani gen­eral A.A.K. Ni­azi, who signed the “in­stru­ment of sur­ren­der” that marked the Indian Army’s vic­tory in the 1971 war. It led to the loss of East Pak­istan and its birth as the new na­tion of Bangladesh.</p>
    <p>The sting­ing loss also put 90,000</p>
    <p>Pak­istani sol­diers as pris­on­ers of war in Indian hands and was the Pak­istan mil­i­tary’s low­est point in post-in­de­pen­dence his­tory. It was a key im­pe­tus for Pak­istan to de­velop nu­clear weapons in or­der to achieve a mea­sure of fu­ture de­ter­rence against its huge neigh­bour, which tested its first nu­clear weapon in 1974.</p>
    <p>Un­sur­pris­ingly, Mr Sharif’s words struck home and a pan­icked ad­min­is­tra­tion seems to have over-re­acted. In an un­prece­dented move, for­mer prime min­is­ter Shahid Khaqan Ab­basi and Mr Sharif, along with the cur­rent prime min­is­ter of Pak­istan-ad­min­is­tered Kash­mir, Mr Raja Fa­rooq Haider, were charged with trea­son for crit­i­cis­ing the mil­i­tary.</p>
    <p>After a rally in Karachi in Sindh prov­ince that fol­lowed the one in Gu­jran­wala, po­lice re­port­edly en­tered the ho­tel room of op­po­si­tion leader Maryam Nawaz, Mr Sharif’s crowd-pulling daugh­ter, and ar­rested her hus­band, re­tired army cap­tain Muham­mad Saf­dar.</p>
    <p>Re­ports sug­gest that when Karachi’s chief of po­lice showed re­luc­tance to con­duct the ar­rest, he was taken to the army’s Corps Com­mand head­quar­ters, stok­ing dis­con­tent within Sindh Po­lice.</p>
    <p>MIL­I­TARY IN A FIX</p>
    <p>The mil­i­tary is now in a quandary; its sup­port for Mr Khan has clearly be­gun to back­fire with the public, risk­ing their cher­ished ad­mi­ra­tion for the force. Mr Khan, too, can­not do with­out his uni­formed back­ers, see­ing that his party holds just 46 per cent of the seats in Par­lia­ment and rules with the help of smaller coali­tion part­ners which need to be kept in line.</p>
    <p>A Gallup Pak­istan sur­vey in Septem­ber re­ported that 47 per cent of those polled blamed Mr Khan’s gov­ern­ment for de­stroy­ing the economy, while 41 per cent dis­agreed. Tellingly, just over half the peo­ple sur­veyed thought the army should stay out of pol­i­tics, while 40 per cent said it has a role in pol­i­tics and over­all man­age­ment of the coun­try.</p>
    <p>Mr Hu­sain Haqqani, a for­mer Pak­istan am­bas­sador to the US who now heads the South Asia pro­gramme at Wash­ing­ton’s Hud­son In­sti­tute, says that while al­liances have been cre­ated sev­eral times since the 1960s to take on mil­i­tary rulers, it is note­wor­thy that the very premise of the mil­i­tary’s role in Pak­istan’s pol­i­tics is be­ing ques­tioned now.</p>
    <p>The Khan gov­ern­ment, he says, while ex­e­cut­ing the army’s be­hind-the-scenes di­rec­tives, has not been able to pro­tect the in­sti­tu­tion from po­lit­i­cal at­tacks. This weak civil­ian fa­cade has opened the door for politi­cians to de­mand “undi­luted democ­racy”.</p>
    <p>The road ahead could be murky. The trea­son charges against key fig­ures do not seem to have fazed PDM, whose pres­i­dent Maulana Fa­zlur Rehman has con­vened a cru­cial meet­ing of con­stituent par­ties in Is­lam­abad on Sun­day. Mr Sharif will ad­dress it, again over video.</p>
    <p>After ral­lies in Gu­jran­wala, Karachi and Quetta, a fourth PDM public meet­ing has been pen­cilled in for Pe­shawar on Nov 22, be­fore mov­ing to the pop­u­lous Pun­jab, Mr Sharif’s power base, where ral­lies are sched­uled in Mul­tan on Nov 30 and the last one in La­hore on Dec 13. PDM lead­ers hope to raise enough num­bers there to shake Is­lam­abad, with a threat­ened “Long March” to the city as the de­noue­ment for the protests.</p>
    <p>Mr Im­ran Khan’s charisma and pull with the peo­ple who so ad­mired him on the cricket field are wear­ing thin. The soar­ing prices of onions, toma­toes and wheat flour muf­fle his cries that Mr Nawaz Sharif is fol­low­ing a “pro-In­dia agenda”. It also drowns out the fact that the Khan gov­ern­ment has done a bet­ter job of han­dling the pan­demic than other Asian states such as In­dia and In­done­sia.</p>
    <p>BE­YOND DO­MES­TIC POL­I­TICS</p>
    <p>Mr Khan’s charisma and pull with the peo­ple who so ad­mired him on the cricket field are wear­ing thin. The soar­ing prices of onions, toma­toes and wheat flour muf­fle his cries that Mr Sharif is fol­low­ing a “pro-In­dia agenda”. It also drowns out the fact that the Khan gov­ern­ment has done a bet­ter job of han­dling the pan­demic than other Asian states such as In­dia and In­done­sia.</p>
    <p>While Pak­istan does en­dure pe­ri­odic cy­cles of do­mes­tic po­lit­i­cal un­rest and eco­nomic slumps – it has needed help from the In­ter­na­tional Mon­e­tary Fund close to two dozen times after deficit blowouts – events in play now have im­pli­ca­tions be­yond its bor­ders be­cause of Is­lam­abad’s close strate­gic ties to Bei­jing.</p>
    <p>Given the pres­sure pil­ing up on China in East Asia and around the Malacca Strait, and re­cent high ten­sion on the Sino-Indian bor­der where there has been gun­fire and deaths after decades, any weak­en­ing of Pak­istan’s mil­i­tary has im­pli­ca­tions for Bei­jing.</p>
    <p>Even as the Pak­istani elite is in­stinc­tively pro-West, the ties with China are borne out of a shared per­cep­tion of In­dia as their com­mon ad­ver­sary. Pak­istan’s Gwadar Port, now un­der long-term lease to China, is also seen as a po­ten­tial ac­cess point to the Gulf for Bei­jing.</p>
    <p>For all these rea­sons, this round of trou­ble is not just about Pak­istan, but China as well.</p>
