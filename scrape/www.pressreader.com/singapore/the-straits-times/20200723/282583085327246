    <p>Heather Morris, who played the best-friend-turned-wife of Naya Rivera’s char­ac­ter in tele­vi­sion mu­si­cal com­edy Glee (2009 to 2015), paid trib­ute to her co-star with a video on Tues­day.</p>
    <p>Rivera’s body was found on July 13 after she dis­ap­peared dur­ing a boat trip with her four-year-old son in Lake Piru, Cal­i­for­nia.</p>
    <p>In the clip on In­sta­gram, the 33-year-old ac­tress is danc­ing to Rivera’s song, Ra­dio Silence (2019). They both played high school cheer­lead­ers in Glee.</p>
    <p>Morris opened up on the loss of her friend: “Griev­ing looks very dif­fer­ently (sic) on ev­ery­one... but one thing’s for cer­tain: I’ve felt it’s hard to feel joy or keep busy when mourn­ing without think­ing that you’re not honour­ing that per­son or you’re for­get­ting about them.”</p>
    <p>But her hus­band Tay­lor Hubbell re­minded her that “honour­ing some­one can mean you’re en­joy­ing your life for them”.</p>
    <p>Morris said the me­dia at­ten­tion gar­nered by Rivera’s dis­ap­pear­ance and death – her body was found five days after she went miss­ing – had led to her amass­ing one mil­lion In­sta­gram fol­low­ers.</p>
    <p>She wrote: “At first I was re­sent­ful be­cause I gained them from a tragedy, but after giv­ing it a breath... I re­alised you all have just sur­rounded me with love and sup­port.”</p>
    <p>So she was pay­ing trib­ute to Rivera with “her music and her voice that will for­ever be my favourite”.</p>
    <p>Ac­tor Chris Colfer, who played a class­mate of Rivera’s char­ac­ter, re­mem­bered her in an es­say pub­lished in Va­ri­ety mag­a­zine on Tues­day.</p>
    <p>The 30-year-old wrote: “I’m not sure any­one on Earth could give Naya Rivera the trib­ute she de­serves.” In the days fol­low­ing her death, he had been “won­der­ing if Naya was even real or if she was just a dream all along”.</p>
    <p>On her dry hu­mour, he penned: “On par­tic­u­larly rough days of film­ing, you might find her out­side en­joy­ing a cig­a­rette in her bright red cheer­lead­ing uni­form. She would raise an in­vis­i­ble glass and say, ‘To be­ing role models!’ or ‘City of dreams, huh?’”</p>
    <p>Rivera had, ac­cord­ing to the au­thor­i­ties, sum­moned the last of her strength to save her son be­fore drown­ing.</p>
    <p>“She spent hours telling us what she was go­ing to name her kids, how she was go­ing to dress them and all the free babysit­ting she’d bam­boo­zle out of us,” Colfer wrote. “Naya was an ex­tra­or­di­nary mother un­til the very end.”</p>
    <p>He ended the es­say with a quote from Rivera: “No mat­ter the year, cir­cum­stance or strife, ev­ery day you’re alive is a bless­ing. Make the most of to­day and ev­ery day you are given. To­mor­row is not promised.”</p>
