    <p>The chief ex­ec­u­tive of NTUC Learn­ingHub, Mr Kwek Kok Kwong, died on Satur­day, aged 53.</p>
    <p>Mr Kwek col­lapsed in the Sele­tar area at about 8pm after a cy­cling ses­sion with a group of friends from his Vic­to­ria School days.</p>
    <p>Paramedics could not de­tect a pulse at the scene and he was taken to hospi­tal but could not be re­sus­ci­tated.</p>
    <p>Mr Kwek’s wife Mag­da­lene Tan, an ed­u­ca­tor, said: “As a hus­band, he was a very good provider. He was a man of few words but he showed his love and care through his ac­tions. He might not say the words ‘I love you’ but he’ll al­ways ask what we need or want.”</p>
    <p>Mr Kwek and his wife, who de­clined to give her age, have a daugh­ter, 23, and a son, 21.</p>
    <p>A spokesman for NTUC Learn­ingHub said: “Dur­ing his nearly eight years with NTUC Learn­ingHub, Kok Kwong was an in­spi­ra­tional CEO who was un­wa­ver­ing in his ded­i­ca­tion to serv­ing the train­ing needs of our work­ers... Our deep­est con­do­lences go out to his fam­ily and all who were touched by his gen­eros­ity, kind­ness and com­pas­sion. We will miss him dearly.”</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to his LinkedIn pro­file, Mr Kwek served with the Sin­ga­pore Armed Forces from 1990 to 2012 prior to his ap­point­ment at NTUC Learn­ingHub.</p>
    <p>He rose to the rank of brigadier­gen­eral in 2009, and over­saw op­er­a­tions in the Repub­lic of Sin­ga­pore Air Force. Since 2016, he was chair­man of the Sin­ga­pore Na­tional Co­op­er­a­tive Fed­er­a­tion. He was the deputy chief ex­ec­u­tive of NTUC First Cam­pus be­tween Au­gust 2012 and De­cem­ber 2015.</p>
    <p>Mr Kwek stud­ied math­e­mat­ics at Cam­bridge Univer­sity. He then went to the Har­vard Univer­sity Kennedy School of Gov­ern­ment, where he got a mas­ter’s in pub­lic ad­min­is­tra­tion.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, a Face­book group called “In remembranc­e of Kwek Kok Kwong 1967-2020, 14th November – the life lived” was cre­ated so Mr Kwek’s friends and fam­ily could post mes­sages and pic­tures on the page to cel­e­brate his life.</p>
    <p>One of Mr Kwek’s friends, Mr Fua Kia Liang, who works in the tech­nol­ogy in­dus­try, said: “I knew K3, as he is more fondly called, back in our mil­i­tary days and we kept in touch ever since... He is grounded and makes a con­scious ef­fort to get along with folks from dif­fer­ent back­grounds.”</p>
