    <p>TAIPEI • Two days of Chi­nese mil­i­tary air­craft ap­proach­ing Tai­wan demon­strate that Bei­jing is a threat to the en­tire re­gion and have shown Tai­wanese even more clearly the true na­ture of China’s gov­ern­ment, Pres­i­dent Tsai Ing­wen said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Mul­ti­ple Chi­nese air­craft flew across the mid-line of the Tai­wan Strait and into Tai­wan’s air de­fence iden­ti­fi­ca­tion zone on Fri­day and Satur­day, caus­ing Tai­wan to scram­ble jets to in­ter­cept. China claims Tai­wan as its own ter­ri­tory.</p>
    <p>At a news con­fer­ence in Bei­jing on Fri­day about China’s United Na­tions peace­keep­ing ef­forts, China an­nounced com­bat drills near the Tai­wan Strait and de­nounced what it called col­lu­sion be­tween the is­land and the United States.</p>
    <p>The ex­er­cises took place as US Un­der­sec­re­tary for Eco­nomic Af­fairs Keith Krach was in Taipei, the most se­nior State Depart­ment of­fi­cial to visit in four decades.</p>
    <p>Speak­ing to re­porters, Ms Tsai de­nounced China’s drills.</p>
    <p>“I be­lieve th­ese ac­tiv­i­ties are no help to China’s in­ter­na­tional im­age and, what’s more, have put Tai­wan’s peo­ple even more on their guard, un­der­stand­ing even bet­ter the true na­ture of the Chi­nese com­mu­nist regime,” she said.</p>
    <p>“Ad­di­tion­ally, other coun­tries in the re­gion also have a bet­ter un­der­stand­ing of the threat posed by China. The Chi­nese com­mu­nists must re­strain them­selves, and not pro­voke.”</p>
    <p>China’s air force on Satur­day put out a video show­ing ex­er­cises by its nu­clear-ca­pa­ble H-6 bombers, which have been in­volved in many Chi­nese fly-bys of Tai­wan. One mon­tage shows a sim­u­la­tion of an H-6 at­tack against an air­base that ap</p>
    <p>pears by its run­way lay­out to be the main US Air Force base on Guam.</p>
    <p>When asked about that footage and China’s de­ci­sion to re­lease it while Mr Krach was in Tai­wan, Ms Tsai said China’s re­cent ac­tiv­i­ties were a threat broader than just to Tai­wan.</p>
    <p>“China’s ex­is­tence is in­deed ag­gres­sive and will bring a def­i­nite threat,” she said.</p>
    <p>In com­ments car­ried by the Chi­nese state me­dia from a fo­rum on re­la­tions with Tai­wan in the south­east­ern Chi­nese city of Xi­a­men, the No. 4 leader of the rul­ing Chi­nese Com­mu­nist Party yes­ter­day did not di­rectly men­tion the re­cent drills.</p>
    <p>Mr Wang Yang, who heads a largely cer­e­mo­nial ad­vi­sory body to China’s Par­lia­ment, re­it­er­ated that Tai­wan in­de­pen­dence was a dead end, and that “re­ly­ing on for­eign­ers to pump your­self up was to take a risk out of des­per­a­tion”.</p>
    <p>“It will only bring Tai­wan risks it can­not bear,” he said, in com­ments made by video.</p>
    <p>Fur­ther fric­tion seems likely as Tai­wan and the US con­tinue to deepen re­la­tions, with Taipei angling for a free trade agree­ment.</p>
    <p>Tai­wan Econ­omy Min­is­ter Wang Mei-hua said yes­ter­day that the is­land plans to hold a for­mal eco­nomic di­a­logue with the US, af­ter hav­ing what she called in­for­mal talks with</p>
    <p>Mr Krach and his team on is­sues such as sup­ply chain re­struc­tur­ing.</p>
    <p>Separately, Ms Tsai said yes­ter­day that there was no plan for her to talk by tele­phone with new Ja­panese Prime Min­is­ter Yoshi­hide Suga, af­ter a Ja­panese en­voy had told her that Mr Suga might be open to it, prompt­ing con­cern in Bei­jing.</p>
    <p>Meet­ing Ms Tsai in Taipei on Fri­day, for­mer Ja­panese prime min­is­ter Yoshiro Mori, vis­it­ing for a memo­rial ser­vice for late pres­i­dent Lee Teng-hui, said Mr Suga told him that “if there is the op­por­tu­nity, he hopes to speak by phone or other means”.</p>
    <p>China’s For­eign Min­istry said late on Satur­day that Ja­pan had told them that such a thing “will never hap­pen”, af­ter Bei­jing sought clar­i­fi­ca­tion from Tokyo.</p>
    <p>Ms Tsai told re­porters that she did not talk about this is­sue with Mr Mori. “We also don’t have this plan at the mo­ment to have a tele­phone con­ver­sa­tion,” she said.</p>
    <p>A spokesman for Ja­pan’s For­eign Min­istry echoed Ms Tsai’s com­ments, say­ing “there is no plan for a tele­phone call” be­tween the two lead­ers.</p>
    <p>I be­lieve th­ese ac­tiv­i­ties are no help to China’s in­ter­na­tional im­age and, what’s more, have put Tai­wan’s peo­ple even more on their guard, un­der­stand­ing even bet­ter the true na­ture of the Chi­nese com­mu­nist regime.</p>
