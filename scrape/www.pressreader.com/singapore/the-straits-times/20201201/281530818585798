    <p>Gamers who missed out on last month’s launch of next-gen­er­a­tion video game con­soles – Mi­crosoft’s Xbox Se­ries X (XSX) and Sony’s PlaySta­tion 5 (PS5) – are out of luck. The con­soles will be re­stocked only in lim­ited quan­ti­ties in the weeks lead­ing up to – and even af­ter – Christ­mas, video game re­tail­ers told The Straits Times.</p>
    <p>Gamers who missed out on last month’s launch of next-gen­er­a­tion video game con­soles – Mi­crosoft’s Xbox Se­ries X (XSX) and Sony’s PlaySta­tion 5 (PS5, pic­tured be­low)</p>
    <p>– are out of luck.</p>
    <p>The con­soles will be re­stocked only in lim­ited quan­ti­ties in the weeks lead­ing up to – and even af­ter – Christ­mas, video game re­tail­ers told The Straits Times.</p>
    <p>At least one shop – Qisahn – lists the es­ti­mated date of avail­abil­ity of the next batch of XSX con­soles as Dec 14, while that for the PS5 is Dec 31.</p>
    <p>Stores said the con­soles were sold out even be­fore they were launched in Sin­ga­pore, amid a sharp drop in sup­ply com­pared with the launch of the last gen­er­a­tion of con­soles about seven years ago.</p>
    <p>The sup­ply crunch was wors­ened this year by the high de­mand for the new gam­ing ma­chines.</p>
    <p>Mr Lim Kok Wee, owner of video game store GameMartz, said: “All the con­soles were snapped up by cus­tomers who had pre-or­dered weeks be­fore their launch.</p>
    <p>“Even so, not ev­ery­one who pre­ordered was able to get his hands on one.”</p>
    <p>He added: “We have ful­filled only 33 per cent of pre-or­ders for PS5 and 40 per cent for XSX so far. There was no stock for walk-in cus­tomers.”</p>
    <p>He said this is the first time de­mand has out­stripped sup­ply when a new con­sole is launched, adding: “There is usu­ally enough stock to meet the pre-or­ders and to stock our shelves.”</p>
    <p>De­mand is also higher this time. Mr Lim said that pre-or­ders for the new con­soles are 20 per cent to 30 per cent higher than those for the pre­vi­ous gen­er­a­tion of con­soles seven years ago.</p>
    <p>The wait­ing list for the new con­soles can range from sev­eral hun­dred or­ders to a cou­ple of thou­sands for some re­tail­ers.</p>
    <p>And they be­lieve that the new con­sole stocks ex­pected in the next few weeks may fall short of this de­mand by two to four times.</p>
    <p>Sony and Mi­crosoft have ac­knowl­edged that their man­u­fac­tur­ing sup­ply chains were com­pro­mised ear­lier this year as Covid-19 spread across the globe.</p>
    <p>The re­sult­ing sup­ply crunch is sorely felt by re­tail­ers here.</p>
    <p>Mr Chris Sng, owner of video games shop PlayE, said his sup­ply of PS5 and XSX con­soles dropped by more than 80 per cent com­pared with seven years ago.</p>
    <p>Mr Lim said his sup­ply dropped by around 70 per cent.</p>
    <p>Mr Sng added: “The short­age has led to peo­ple re­selling (the con­soles) on­line for more than dou­ble the price.”</p>
    <p>A check last Fri­day found that the PS5 con­sole – set to re­tail at $729 – is of­fered on Carousell for be­tween $1,300 and $1,800.</p>
    <p>The XSX, which is slightly cheaper with a sug­gested re­tail price of $699, is listed at be­tween $800 and $1,000 on the e-com­merce plat­form.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, de­mand for the con­soles has been boosted by the Covid-19 pan­demic, said Mr Marc Ein­stein, chief an­a­lyst at Ja­pan­based IT re­search firm ITR Cor­po­ra­tion.</p>
    <p>“In­ter­est i n video games has risen as peo­ple are stuck at home dur­ing the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>“They are more will­ing to buy new con­soles and video games since they are not spend­ing on travel or cloth­ing,” he said.</p>
    <p>When asked if Sony or Mi­crosoft could be cre­at­ing ar­ti­fi­cial short­ages of the con­soles to garner hype – which Nin­tendo, maker of the pop­u­lar Switch con­sole, has been ac­cused of in the past – Mr Ein­stein said it is not likely.</p>
    <p>“I think Sony and Mi­crosoft did not an­tic­i­pate that there would be such huge de­mand for the PS5 and XSX. Both sides have since marked their prod­uct as the big­gest con­sole launch in the (re­spec­tive) com­pany’s his­tory,” he said.</p>
    <p>“The re­sale of con­soles (on sec­ondary mar­kets) is also not good for the brand.</p>
    <p>“It ir­ri­tates peo­ple be­cause they have to pay more to buy one and it i ncreases the like­li­hood of fraud,” he added.</p>
    <p>Mr Tim Wi­j­man, mar­ket lead at games and es­ports an­a­lyt­ics firm New­zoo, said there is no in­cen­tive for Sony and Mi­crosoft to limit sup­ply as their goal is to get as many peo­ple as pos­si­ble into their ecosys­tem.</p>
    <p>“The con­sole busi­ness it­self has very tight profit mar­gins, and for both com­pa­nies, the high­est profit mar­gin is in sell­ing games and sub­scrip­tions through dig­i­tal plat­forms,” he said.</p>
    <p>“It is there­fore in their in­ter­est to get their con­soles in as many house­holds as pos­si­ble.”</p>
    <p>The short­age is so se­vere that re­tail­ers are not see­ing the usual sales boost that ac­com­pa­nies a prod­uct launch.</p>
    <p>Mr Sng said: “De­mand for older con­soles, like PS4 and Xbox One, falls when a new model is out.</p>
    <p>“Yet I don’t have enough stock to sup­port de­mand for the new mod­els.”</p>
    <p>He added that prod­uct launches usu­ally boost monthly sales num­bers by three to four times, but sales have been stag­nant so far.</p>
    <p>He said: “But I’m op­ti­mistic that busi­ness will be up again, es­pe­cially when the sup­ply of new con­soles catches up with de­mand in the com­ing months.”</p>
