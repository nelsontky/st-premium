    <p>Phish­ing e-mails that at­tempt to trick vic­tims into giv­ing up per­sonal in­for­ma­tion con­tinue to be a sig­nif­i­cant cy­ber threat in Sin­ga­pore, with only a hand­ful of re­spon­dents of an on­line poll cor­rectly iden­ti­fy­ing all phish­ing e-mails shown to them.</p>
    <p>In the on­line pub­lic aware­ness sur­vey con­ducted by the Cy­ber Se­cu­rity Agency of Sin­ga­pore (CSA) last De­cem­ber, two-thirds of the 1,000 re­spon­dents had in­di­cated they knew what phish­ing is.</p>
    <p>But only about 40 cor­rectly iden­ti­fied all eight emails given by the sur­vey, six of which were phish­ing e-mails. The other two e-mails did not in­volve an at­tempt to fraud­u­lently ex­tract de­tails.</p>
    <p>In the CSA poll, more than half of the re­spon­dents were un­able to iden­tify the two le­git­i­mate e-mails cor­rectly, ei­ther peg­ging the e-mails as phish­ing at­tempts or in­di­cat­ing that they were un­sure. Just over half or 57 per cent were able to iden­tify e-mails with sus­pi­cious at­tach­ments and about the same num­ber or 53 per cent could cor­rectly iden­tify e-mails that had fraud­u­lently re­quested con­fi­den­tial in­for­ma­tion.</p>
    <p>Po­lice fig­ures show that be­tween Jan­uary and March this year, bank phish­ing scams were re­spon­si­ble for 374 vic­tims los­ing at least $1.6 mil­lion in to­tal.</p>
    <p>Scam­mers had used e-mails and text mes­sages and posed as bank staff to trick the vic­tims into re­veal­ing their In­ter­net bank­ing de­tails. The sec­tion on phish­ing was a new ad­di­tion to CSA’s an­nual pub­lic aware­ness sur­vey, which has been con­ducted since 2016.</p>
    <p>The sur­vey re­vealed high lev­els of con­cern for cy­ber in­ci­dents among mem­bers of the pub­lic, but many re­spon­dents con­tin­ued to think that these in­ci­dents would not hap­pen to them, the CSA said.</p>
    <p>For ex­am­ple, only 47 per cent of re­spon­dents were found to have in­stalled se­cu­rity ap­pli­ca­tions in their mo­bile de­vices, de­spite 85 per cent ac­knowl­edg­ing the risks of not in­stalling such ap­pli­ca­tions.</p>
    <p>“With our in­creas­ing re­liance on tech­nol­ogy, es­pe­cially amid the Covid-19 pan­demic, op­por­tunis­tic cy­ber criminals now have a big­ger hunt­ing ground,” said CSA chief ex­ec­u­tive David Koh.</p>
    <p>Phish­ing e-mails have grown in num­ber and so­phis­ti­ca­tion over the past few years. There were 47,500 cases of phish­ing in Sin­ga­pore last year, nearly three times the num­ber in 2018, ac­cord­ing to the CSA.</p>
    <p>There were also 1,500 du­bi­ous links sent be­tween March and May this year dur­ing Sin­ga­pore’s cir­cuit breaker pe­riod, dou­ble the num­ber in the pre­ced­ing three months.</p>
    <p>Com­mu­ni­ca­tions and In­for­ma­tion Min­is­ter S. Iswaran said Sin­ga­pore­ans are beginning to prac­tise bet­ter cy­ber hy­giene habits such as us­ing two-fac­tor au­then­ti­ca­tion for more se­cure on­line trans­ac­tions.</p>
    <p>In a Face­book post on Satur­day, he said: “How­ever, the (sur­vey) find­ings re­veal that even among younger and more cy­ber savvy Sin­ga­pore­ans, we may not al­ways be able to dif­fer­en­ti­ate be­tween le­git­i­mate and phish­ing e-mails. So let’s not let our guard down.”</p>
