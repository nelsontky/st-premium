        Life Features | The Sunday Times Sunday, August 23, 2020 | C8 Singapore Musical Box Museum The music box, which gained popularity in the 19th century, does not play only tinkly tunes.
At the Singapore Musical Box Museum in Telok Ayer Street, one music box booms with the layered notes of an orchestra.
There is literally a mini orchestra within this music box, which encloses a piano, mandolin, drums, cymbals and a triangle.
Made in Germany, it was installed on a cruise ship for entertainm­ent in the early 20th century. Wider than a fridge, at 2m high, it is taller than the average man.
At the Lilliputia­n end of the scale, a Swiss wind-up instrument measures 5cm by 7cm, fitting nicely into a snuff box.
With more than 40 music boxes and other artefacts, the museum showcases an under-appreciate­d slice of musical history.
Its chief executive officer Takumi Minami notes that the music box was an important form of early recorded music before it was “killed off” by the phonograph, invented i n 1877 by American Thomas Edison, which later became known as the gramophone.
Unusual offerings at the museum include a porcelain music box with revolving cigarette holders, possibly used by chic society types chillaxing in a salon.
Step into the next room and a slight unease enlivens the proceeding­s. A music box takes the form of two birds, preserved by taxidermy, in a cage. Through a whistle-like mechanism, these creatures twitch their beaks and bodies, emitting perfect birdsong. It is eccentric, but the sheer artistry is cause for wonder.
168 Telok Ayer Street Mondays to Saturdays,
10am to 6pm
$12 (adults), $6 (students and seniors)
