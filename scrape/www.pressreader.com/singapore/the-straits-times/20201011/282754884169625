    <p>Ms Sadaf Gull moved to Dubai from Pak­istan per­ma­nently in 2005 af­ter her hus­band, a de­vel­op­ment man­ager, took on a lu­cra­tive of­fer in the city. The tax-free salary, Is­lamic cul­ture and se­cure en­vi­ron­ment were draw­cards.</p>
    <p>There, they set­tled down and brought up two chil­dren.</p>
    <p>But the Covid-19 pan­demic up­ended ev­ery­thing. In March, just two months af­ter the first cases of coro­n­avirus were re­ported, the num­ber of in­fec­tions shot up to 600, with five deaths.</p>
    <p>The govern­ment i mposed a month-long, 24-hour cur­few that dev­as­tated busi­nesses – in­clud­ing the mo­bile ac­ces­sories trader for whom Ms Sadaf’s hus­band worked. His salary was halved.</p>
    <p>“It was get­ting im­pos­si­ble to pay the rent, school fees and bear other ex­penses. Af­ter much de­lib­er­a­tion, we moved back to Pak­istan,” Ms Sadaf tells In­sight.</p>
    <p>How­ever, her hus­band has been able to keep work­ing re­motely</p>
    <p>from Pak­istan with his em­ployer in Dubai since they moved in July.</p>
    <p>Ms Sadaf says: “My hus­band’s em­ployer is very co­op­er­a­tive. We are very happy here. Things have fallen in place.”</p>
    <p>With many be­ing re­trenched or hav­ing their pay slashed, the pan­demic has sent mil­lions of ex­pa­tri­ates back to their home coun­tries from the Gulf Co­op­er­a­tion Coun­cil (GCC), an eco­nomic and po­lit­i­cal union that com­prises Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Ara­bia and the United Arab Emi­rates (UAE).</p>
    <p>With­out a so­cial safety net, many more are ex­pected to leave once the</p>
    <p>bor­der re­stric­tions ease, ac­cord­ing to a re­port in May by Bri­tish-based think-tank Ox­ford Eco­nomics.</p>
    <p>GULF STATES’</p>
    <p>RE­LIANCE ON EX­PA­TRI­ATES</p>
    <p>For decades, the GCC has re­lied on for­eign work­ers, and as a re­sult the UAE’s pop­u­la­tion grew from about one mil­lion in the 1980s to 9.8 mil­lion.</p>
    <p>To­day, for­eign work­ers rep­re­sent 90 per cent of the pop­u­la­tion in the UAE and Qatar. And in Qatar, 95 per cent of the work­force are for­eign­ers.</p>
    <p>South Asians make up the largest group in the GCC. There are around</p>
    <p>3.8 mil­lion South Asians who work and re­side in the UAE, ac­count­ing for 59.4 per cent of its ex­pa­tri­ates.</p>
    <p>Many were drawn to the sky­scrapers, world-class ho­tels and lux­ury beach re­sorts in cities like Abu Dhabi and Dubai.</p>
    <p>Some, like Mr You­nis Rashid, a res­tau­rant man­ager from In­dia, en­joy mix­ing with dif­fer­ent peo­ple.</p>
    <p>“I love its mul­ti­cul­tural en­vi­ron­ment. Liv­ing in Dubai showed me that there is no per­sonal en­mity be­tween the peo­ple of In­dia and Pak­istan. Ev­ery­one works for each other in the UAE,” Mr You­nis says.</p>
    <p>But, with the on­set of Covid-19, Mr You­nis was laid off, and has</p>
    <p>moved back to his home town in Kash­mir af­ter liv­ing in Dubai for five years.</p>
    <p>Another In­dian ex­pa­tri­ate, who de­clined to be named, tells In­sight that his ser­vices were re­cently ter­mi­nated by a Dubai com­pany, along with half of his for­mer col­leagues.</p>
    <p>“There were 40 of us but now there are only 15 to 20 left,” he says.</p>
    <p>When the pan­demic be­gan to spread rapidly across the world, gov­ern­ments also scram­bled to evacuate their cit­i­zens.</p>
    <p>The In­dian govern­ment said in Au­gust that it has repa­tri­ated 275,000 In­dian ex­pa­tri­ates over­all, while</p>
    <p>Pak­istan evac­u­ated over 60,000 of its cit­i­zens from the UAE.</p>
    <p>As com­pa­nies pare head­counts, many more are ex­pected to leave.</p>
    <p>The visas of ex­pa­tri­ates in the GCC are of­ten tied to their em­ploy­ment. With­out a so­cial safety net, many who lost their jobs chose to re­turn home.</p>
    <p>Ox­ford Eco­nomics es­ti­mates that the de­par­tures will re­duce the GCC’s pop­u­la­tion by 4 per cent in Saudi Ara­bia and Oman, and as much as 10 per cent in the UAE and Qatar.</p>
    <p>The pan­demic might have af­fected ex­pa­tri­ates, but its im­pact is far greater on low-wage mi­grant work­ers, many of whom are</p>
    <p>stranded and have had to live for months on end with­out pay.</p>
    <p>Ms Nazia came to the UAE 12 years ago from Bangladesh to work as a cleaner with a se­cu­rity com­pany, to sup­port her fam­ily af­ter her hus­band died of a heart at­tack.</p>
    <p>She left Bangladesh in 2008, leav­ing her tod­dler kids in the care of her sis­ter-in-law, and has been able to see them only once ev­ery two years.</p>
    <p>With a monthly in­come of around US$400 (S$540) to US$500, she was able to pay for her chil­dren’s school­ing and other fam­ily ex­penses.</p>
    <p>But as Covid-19 takes a toll on</p>
    <p>busi­nesses, Ms Nazia has been put on un­paid leave for more than four months now.</p>
    <p>She says: “Though we have been pro­vided with ac­com­mo­da­tion and given money for food, we don’t go to work and so we have no salary.”</p>
    <p>Another Bangladesh­i, 45-yearold Delawar, says he has been un­able to pay the rent for his flat for six months, af­ter be­ing re­trenched from his job as a cabin crew driver for an avi­a­tion com­pany.</p>
    <p>He is strug­gling to feed his fam­ily of three. And, to make mat­ters worse, he has to care for his ail­ing wife who has kid­ney fail­ure and needs dial­y­sis reg­u­larly.</p>
    <p>“I can­not even go back to Bangladesh be­cause here I get free dial­y­sis and medicine for my wife. Back home, I have to pay for it and it costs a lot of money, which I don’t have.”</p>
    <p>QUIET DUBAI</p>
    <p>Oc­to­ber is usu­ally the month when sum­mer be­gins to ebb in the UAE.</p>
    <p>As win­ter ar­rives, events such as con­certs, fire­works and re­tail sales usu­ally kick off in earnest, draw­ing mil­lions of for­eign tourists.</p>
    <p>But tourist at­trac­tions and busi­ness cen­tres that are usu­ally teem­ing with peo­ple are now de­serted.</p>
    <p>Busi­nesses, rang­ing from jew­ellery and gar­ment stores to su­per­mar­kets and restau­rants, have closed for good.</p>
    <p>A sur­vey by the Dubai Cham­ber of Com­merce in April found that 70 per cent of busi­nesses in the city were ex­pected to close within the next six months.</p>
    <p>One for­mer man­ager of a chain store sell­ing furniture and an­tiques in Dubai says the com­pany had to let go of over 100 em­ploy­ees and close two out­lets to sur­vive.</p>
    <p>AL­READY LEAV­ING</p>
    <p>The UAE’s econ­omy is ex­pected to con­tract by 3.5 per cent this year, ac­cord­ing to the In­ter­na­tional Mone­tary Fund.</p>
    <p>Em­ploy­ment across the GCC is es­ti­mated to fall by 13 per cent, as 900,000 peo­ple in the UAE and 1.7 mil­lion in Saudi Ara­bia will lose their jobs, ac­cord­ing to Ox­ford Eco­nomics.</p>
    <p>Ms Pat Thaker, re­gional di­rec­tor of the Economist In­tel­li­gence Unit in charge of the Mid­dle East and Africa, says: “When your economies are in neg­a­tive ter­ri­tory, you are not go­ing to have that many jobs. So the first peo­ple who have to go are the non-lo­cals, who are the ex­pats.”</p>
    <p>But even be­fore the pan­demic, ex­pa­tri­ates were al­ready leav­ing.</p>
    <p>To re­duce their de­pen­dency on for­eign labour, the GCC coun­tries have in re­cent years en­cour­aged busi­nesses in the pri­vate sec­tor to hire more lo­cals, who have tra­di­tion­ally opted for bet­ter-paid but lim­ited po­si­tions in the pub­lic sec­tor.</p>
    <p>Oman has banned ex­pa­tri­ates from work­ing in more than 80 job cat­e­gories. In Saudi Ara­bia, the Saud­i­s­a­tion, or Ni­taqat, pro­gramme in­tro­duced in 2011 re­quired com­pa­nies to hire a cer­tain num­ber of Saudi na­tion­als.</p>
    <p>The UAE, Kuwait, Qatar and Bahrain are all mov­ing towards in­creas­ing lo­cal hires.</p>
    <p>And, more re­cently, the oil price crash that pushed the Gulf coun­tries into re­ces­sion drove even more ex­pa­tri­ates away.</p>
    <p>“The GCC is wit­ness­ing the worst down­turn since the 1980s,” says Ms Thaker.</p>
    <p>“Busi­nesses are hard-pressed to sur­vive, with lit­tle rev­enue and no op­tion for a safe exit,” she adds.</p>
    <p>“Even be­fore the pan­demic, al­ready tens of thou­sands of ex­pa­tri­ates have been repa­tri­ated due to Saud­i­s­a­tion, or Ni­taqat.”</p>
    <p>In­deed, the pan­demic, which has in­fected 852,872 peo­ple and claimed 7,502 lives across the GCC as at last week, has also gal­vanised long-run­ning ef­forts by its gov­ern­ments to re­place ex­pa­tri­ates with lo­cals.</p>
    <p>In­dus­tries in the re­tail, hos­pi­tal­ity and res­tau­rant sec­tors, where jobs were usu­ally taken by for­eign­ers, have been hir­ing more lo­cals.</p>
    <p>Un­like their par­ents, who of­ten choose to work for the govern­ment, Ms Thaker says the young gen­er­a­tion in the GCC are keen to take over key roles in the pri­vate sec­tors.</p>
    <p>“The young peo­ple are very dif­fer­ent from their fathers and grand­fa­thers. They are very happy to work in the pri­vate sec­tors – for ex­am­ple, IT. There are more en­gi­neers and doc­tors among them,” she says.</p>
    <p>“If you look at Saudi Ara­bia, 50 per cent of its pri­vate sec­tor now em­ploys lo­cals. Yes, the pub­lic sec­tors are where many lo­cals will want to work. But the pri­vate sec­tors have in­creas­ingly be­come a source of jobs for the lo­cals as well.”</p>
    <p>How­ever, some ex­pa­tri­ates like Mr Anand (not his real name) are un­de­terred and are stay­ing in the Gulf and rid­ing out the storm.</p>
    <p>The In­dian ex­pat, who used to earn more than US$12,000 a month work­ing for a lead­ing tech­nol­ogy com­pany in Dubai, says: “I came here just t wo months be­fore Covid-19 hit. I had brought my wife and new­born baby, too. But, within a few months, I lost my job.</p>
    <p>“I sent my fam­ily back but I’m stay­ing here to hunt for a new job.”</p>
