    <p>WASHINGTON • Two Nasa astro­nauts who rode to the In­ter­na­tional Space Sta­tion aboard SpaceX’s new Crew Dragon were head­ing home for splash­down in the Gulf of Mex­ico yes­ter­day, cap­ping a twom­onth voy­age that marked the US space agency’s first crewed mis­sion from home soil in nine years.</p>
    <p>Crew Dragon En­deav­our de­cou­pled from the or­bital sta­tion at 7.35pm Eastern Stan­dard Time last Satur­day car­ry­ing US astro­nauts Bob Behnken and Doug Hur­ley ahead of the splash­down off Pen­sacola, Florida – the first pro­ce­dure of its kind in a pri­vately built space cap­sule.</p>
    <p>“It’s been a great two months, and we ap­pre­ci­ate all you’ve done as a crew to help us prove out Dragon on its maiden flight,” Mr Hur­ley told the re­main­ing US sta­tion crew mem­ber Chris Cas­sidy, as the Crew Dragon au­tonomously eased away from its dock­ing port to be­gin the 21-hour jour­ney home.</p>
    <p>Nasa and SpaceX – mon­i­tor­ing the crew’s re­turn from Hous­ton, Texas and SpaceX’s head­quar­ters in Hawthorne, Cal­i­for­nia – had last week ruled out splash­down op­tions in the At­lantic ow­ing to Tropical Storm Isa­ias, ex­pected to churn along­side Florida’s east coast as a hur­ri­cane in the com­ing days.</p>
    <p>Upon a suc­cess­ful splash­down at 2.48pm Eastern Stan­dard Time yes­ter­day, the space­craft would have com­pleted its fi­nal key test to prove it can trans­port astro­nauts to and from space – a task SpaceX has ac­com­plished dozens of times with its cargo-only cap­sule, but never be­fore with hu­mans aboard.</p>
    <p>“The hard­est part was get­ting us launched, but the most im­por­tant part is bring­ing us home,” Mr Behnken said dur­ing a farewell cer­e­mony early last Satur­day aboard the space sta­tion.</p>
    <p>Bil­lion­aire en­tre­pre­neur Elon Musk’s SpaceX be­came the first pri­vate com­pany to send hu­mans to or­bit on May 31, with the launch of Mr Behnken and Mr Hur­ley, who would have spent more than two months in the space sta­tion upon re­turn­ing.</p>
    <p>The mis­sion marked the first time the Na­tional Aero­nau­tics and Space Ad­min­is­tra­tion has launched hu­mans from US soil since its shut­tle pro­gramme re­tired in 2011. Since then, the United States had re­lied on Rus­sia’s space pro­gramme to launch its astro­nauts to the space sta­tion.</p>
    <p>Nasa of­fi­cials have said the Crew Dragon, an acorn­shaped pod that can seat up to seven astro­nauts, has been in a “very healthy” con­di­tion since dock­ing to the space sta­tion, where astro­nauts have been con­duct­ing tests and mon­i­tor­ing how the space­craft per­forms over time in space.</p>
    <p>Mr Behnken and Mr Hur­ley would have had a few hours for sleep dur­ing their jour­ney home in the cap­sule, which grad­u­ally de­creased its or­bital al­ti­tude through a se­ries of au­to­mated thruster fir­ings.</p>
    <p>“They’ve got plenty of food and wa­ter aboard the space­craft,” SpaceX en­gi­neer Siva Bharad­vaj said dur­ing a live stream­ing of the un­dock­ing.</p>
    <p>Nasa, aim­ing to gal­vanise a com­mer­cial space mar­ket­place, awarded nearly US$8 bil­lion (S$11 bil­lion) to SpaceX and Boe­ing col­lec­tively in 2014 to de­velop du­elling space cap­sules, ex­per­i­ment­ing with a con­tract model that al­lows the space agency to buy as­tro­naut seats from the two com­pa­nies.</p>
