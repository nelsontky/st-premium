    <p>Youth in Lam­pung, South Su­ma­tra, clash­ing with riot po­lice on the sec­ond day of protests against In­done­sia’s labour re­forms.</p>
    <p>The so-called job cre­ation law has been cham­pi­oned by</p>
    <p>Pres­i­dent Joko Wi­dodo’s gov­ern­ment as a way to cut red tape and boost for­eign in­vest­ment, but crit­ics say it favours busi­nesses and erodes work­ers’ rights.</p>
    <p>In­done­sian po­lice ar­rested hun­dreds of pro­test­ers yes­ter­day, af­ter us­ing wa­ter can­non and tear gas to dis­perse an­gry crowds who threw stones and burned tyres in sev­eral lo­ca­tions across the ar­chi­pel­ago.</p>
    <p>Po­lice in In­done­sia ar­rested hun­dreds of pro­test­ers and used wa­ter can­non and tear gas to dis­perse crowds as thou­sands con­tin­ued to rally across the coun­try yes­ter­day, for the sec­ond day run­ning, against a new labour law.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to Reuters, nearly 400 peo­ple were de­tained yes­ter­day, af­ter pro­test­ers ral­lied out­side Par­lia­ment in Palem­bang, South Su­ma­tra, and in the cap­i­tal Jakarta.</p>
    <p>Some were armed with Molo­tov cock­tails and sharp weapons, the news agency re­ported.</p>
    <p>The new law, passed in Par­lia­ment on Mon­day, was touted as nec­es­sary to at­tract for­eign in­vest­ments and cre­ate jobs to re­dress a pan­demic-bat­tered econ­omy.</p>
    <p>In­done­sia – South-east Asia’s largest econ­omy – has been try­ing to stay on par with neigh­bour­ing coun­tries in terms of how flex­i­ble the labour laws are when it comes to hir­ing and fir­ing.</p>
    <p>The new law al­lows com­pa­nies to keep work­ers on con­tract in­def­i­nitely, but also pro­vides for the first time gov­ern­ment-spon­sored job se­cu­rity in­sur­ance.</p>
    <p>Crit­ics say this dis­in­cen­tivises for­mal hir­ing and weak­ens work­ers rights. The law has also been slammed for re­duc­ing en­vi­ron­men­tal pro­tec­tions.</p>
    <p>Of­fi­cers in riot gear have been bat­tling pro­test­ers since Tues­day, pre­dom­i­nantly in the most pop­u­lous is­land of Java where many in­dus­trial cen­tres are lo­cated.</p>
    <p>In Jakarta po­lice spokesman Colonel Yusri Yunus said more than 200 pro­test­ers were de­tained for plan­ning to com­mit an­ar­chic acts.</p>
    <p>Lo­cal me­dia re­ported stu­dents burn­ing tyres and pelt­ing po­lice with stones.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, clashes in Ban­dung in­ten­si­fied as po­lice used wa­ter can­non and tear gas to push back pro­test­ers who tried to break into the lo­cal Par­lia­ment com­pound.</p>
    <p>Footage from the Ja­vanese city of Se­marang showed pro­test­ers tear­ing down the fence of the Par­lia­ment com­plex, Reuters re­ported.</p>
    <p>In down­town Sa­marinda, the cap­i­tal of East Kal­i­man­tan prov­ince, sev­eral hun­dred peo­ple took to the streets yes­ter­day morn­ing, car­ry­ing flags and ban­ners that read “Bring down the job cre­ation law”.</p>
    <p>In­dus­try Min­is­ter Agus Gu­mi­wang Kar­tasas­mita told em­ploy­ers to have “in­tense di­a­logues” with union lead­ers to re­mind them of the risk of Covid-19 spread­ing among large crowds of pro­test­ers, which could in turn lead to new clus­ters of in­fec­tion.</p>
    <p>He also stressed that the in­dus­trial sec­tor should run un­in­ter­rupted, es­pe­cially as the econ­omy strug­gles to re­cover af­ter be­ing hit by the coro­n­avirus pan­demic.</p>
    <p>“Em­ploy­ers and em­ploy­ees must pro­mote syn­ergy and hard work is in­creas­ingly needed to main­tain in­vestors’ and buy­ers’ con­fi­dence,” Mr Agus said in a cir­cu­lar sent to com­pa­nies.</p>
    <p>Co­or­di­nat­ing Mar­itime Af­fairs and In­vest­ment Min­is­ter Luhut Pand­jai­tan said on TVOne on Tues­day night that the new labour law would ben­e­fit the In­done­sian labour force as a whole, be­cause it would at­tract new for­eign in­vest­ments and pro­vide the un­em­ployed with jobs.</p>
    <p>The eco­nomic slump due to the coro­n­avirus pan­demic is es­ti­mated to have wiped out more than 3.7 mil­lion jobs in In­done­sia, bring­ing the es­ti­mated to­tal of the un­em­ployed to 10.6 mil­lion, or nearly 8 per cent of the 133 mil­lion work­ers in the coun­try.</p>
    <p>“No gov­ern­ment would want to dis­ad­van­tage its own peo­ple. I ap­peal to all labour unions... please use your heart. Dur­ing this pan­demic, (street protests) could cost lives... and jeop­ar­dise the oper­a­tions of the com­pa­nies that pay work­ers’ wages,” said Mr Luhut.</p>

Of&#xAD;fi&#xAD;cers in riot gear fired mul&#xAD;ti&#xAD;ple rounds of tear gas to dis&#xAD;perse pro&#xAD;test&#xAD;ers who tried to break through road bar&#xAD;ri&#xAD;cades, pre&#xAD;dom&#xAD;i&#xAD;nantly in the most pop&#xAD;u&#xAD;lous is&#xAD;land of Java, where many in&#xAD;dus&#xAD;try cen&#xAD;tres are lo&#xAD;cated.</p>
