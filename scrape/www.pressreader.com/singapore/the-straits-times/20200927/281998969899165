    <p>When overnight leader by two, Matthew Wolff lined up his first putt on the 18th hole on the fi­nal day, it seemed a per­func­tory tap.</p>
    <p>It was a five-foot down­hill putt at the Winged Foot Golf Club, and Wolff al­ready knew that his 2020 US Open run­ner-up po­si­tion was se­cure as he held a two-shot lead over third-placed Louis Oosthuizen, sit­ting in the club­house.</p>
    <p>The Amer­i­can missed, then made it on his sec­ond at­tempt to even­tu­ally fin­ish six shots be­hind his coun­try­man Bryson DeChambeau, who won his first Ma­jor last Sun­day.</p>
    <p>But he could have joined DeChambeau as the only two play­ers to go sub-par in to­tal on a treach­er­ous course where the rough seems un­playable and the un­du­lat­ing greens tor­rid.</p>
    <p>So DeChambeau not only achieved that feat, but was also the only golfer not to go over over-par on all four rounds of the par-70 lay­out that brought many cham­pi­ons, in­clud­ing 15-time Ma­jor win­ner Tiger Woods and five-time vic­to­ri­ous Phil Mick­el­son to their knees.</p>
    <p>Now that the new cham­pion has dis­man­tled Winged Foot, the muchaired talk about sub­ject of Tiger­proof­ing sur­faced again. And it sur­rounds ways and means to­wards a new la­bel: “Break­ing Bryson”.</p>
    <p>With the Masters and Au­gusta loom­ing in just over a month’s time, of­fi­cials are won­der­ing how they can stop, or rather check, the power of the only man among 144 play­ers to have tamed Winged Foot last week with rounds of 69-68-70-67 for a six-un­der 274 to­tal.</p>
    <p>DeChambeau emerged vic­to­ri­ous on a course with suf­fo­cat­ing fair­ways and stran­gling rough, so will the for­giv­ing Au­gusta where the fair­ways are tame and rough vir­tu­ally non-ex­is­tent be a vic­tim to the Amer­i­can’s “bomb-away style?</p>
    <p>And USGA of­fi­cials would likely shud­der at the threat­en­ing re­ac­tion from the new cham­pion who said af­ter his vic­tory: “I beat the golf course. I dom­i­nated it. I’m not go­ing to stop.</p>
    <p>“Next week, I’m go­ing to be try­ing a 48-inch driver. We’re go­ing to be mess­ing with some head de­signs and do some amaz­ing things with Co­bra to make it fea­si­ble to hit th­ese drives maybe 360, 370, maybe even far­ther.”</p>
    <p>Then the pow­er­ful long-hit­ter, who added 30 pounds of muscle to his frame with his high-calo­rie diet and ex­ten­sive gym work in the past 10 months, added: “I’m 230 to 235, right now. I think I can get to 245.”</p>
    <p>Dis­tance is a big ad­van­tage in golf, namely at Au­gusta. And</p>
    <p>Woods con­firmed that when he turned fa­bled Au­gusta Na­tional into a pitch-and-putt course, en route to win­ning by 12 shots at a record 19-un­der par in 1997.</p>
    <p>The phrase “Tiger-proofing” was coined then to stop Woods as Au­gusta of­fi­cials be­gan to mod­ify the course, length­en­ing it and adding trees to tighten it up. But DeChambeau replied: “It’s tough to rein in ath­leti­cism. We’re al­ways go­ing to be try­ing to get fit­ter, stronger, more ath­letic. Tiger in­spired this whole gen­er­a­tion to do this, and we’re go­ing to keep go­ing af­ter it. I don’t think it’s go­ing to stop. Will they rein it back? I’m sure.</p>
    <p>“I’m sure some­thing might hap­pen. But I don’t know what it will be. I just know that length is al­ways go­ing to be an ad­van­tage.”</p>
    <p>And the power-driver, who av­er­aged 325 yards off the tee at Winged Foot, is now plan­ning to try out a 48inch driver – al­most 3 inches above the av­er­age driver – next week.</p>
    <p>Golf­ing ri­vals, be­ware!</p>
    <p>Adrian Tan, 64, is a busy man who runs an ad­ver­tis­ing agency. But the af­fa­ble hard­work­ing per­son­al­ity al­ways finds time to play golf with his friends and busi­ness as­so­ciates.</p>
    <p>A win­ner of many lo­cal golf ti­tles, he has also shone in foot­ball and squash in his younger days. Here, he also talks about he has over­come his dys­lexia and ADHD to present him­self as a true sports­man.</p>
    <p>How did you get started in golf, and how were your early ex­pe­ri­ences?</p>
    <p>Tan: In the 80s, golf was a bit of an elit­ist game. Not so much as the game it­self but to play golf, you needed to be a mem­ber of a golf club.</p>
    <p>I was one of the ear­li­est to join Sin­ga­pore Is­land Coun­try Club when its mem­ber­ships be­came trans­fer­able in 1991.</p>
    <p>I was drawn by the chem­istry of golf. It has all the ticks for me. It’s the per­fect ther­a­peu­tic es­cape for me to be one with na­ture. Af­ter the first drive you are away from the noise of com­merce and the city.</p>
    <p>The chal­lenge of be­com­ing a sin­gle hand­i­cap­per in­trigues and be­came an ob­ses­sion for me. I have never seen golf as a recre­ational sport but as a com­pet­i­tive game.</p>
    <p>The game also chal­lenges two of my is­sues which I find very sat­is­fy­ing.</p>
    <p>Be­ing dyslexic, I am con­stantly hav­ing to meet one of the most im­por­tant de­mands of the game. Align­ment.</p>
    <p>For me left is right and right is some­times left, which of­ten leaves me in a com­pletely con­fused state. For ex­am­ple, I can see that it’s clearly a down­hill putt but I am wired as an up­hill one.</p>
    <p>As for my ADHD (At­ten­tion Deficit Hy­per­ac­tiv­ity Dis­or­der), I am com­pletely dis­tracted. My mind is like a big satel­lite dish cap­tur­ing all the deci­bels in the golf course. To stay fo­cused is a huge is­sue.</p>
    <p>But I just love the chal­lenges that this won­der­ful game of golf present to me. I can’t change that I am dyslexic nor can I change be­ing ADHD.</p>
    <p>But I learn to ne­go­ti­ate, adapt and over­come th­ese is­sues through com­pen­sa­tion strate­gies which have worked for me so that I can play golf com­pet­i­tively.</p>
    <p>My early ex­pe­ri­ences: Golf is a game that of­fers many life’s lessons.</p>
    <p>The No. 1 les­son is about hon­esty. It of­fers so many oc­ca­sions that one can cheat, be it an un­de­clared air shot, a lost ball, mov­ing the ball to a pre­ferred lie, or declar­ing a stroke or two fewer than it should. Golf re­veals you, so bet­ter to have a good rep­u­ta­tion than to win the wa­ger al­ways.</p>
    <p>The game also teaches you cour­tesy and to be con­sid­er­ate. Play only when it’s your turn and al­ways be aware that there are other golfers around you be­yond your flight mates.</p>
    <p>From my first ro­mance with golf, it is all about golf as a sport to be ex­celled. I can’t stand the game be­ing recre­ational. As I see it as a sport, I hate los­ing.</p>
    <p>When I first started, un­like many, I was in no hurry for my first round of golf. I was very con­vinced that the only way to en­joy golf was to have the ba­sics of the golf swings well honed.</p>
    <p>I didn’t just read the Ben Ho­gan’s 5 fun­da­men­tals of Golf, I stud­ied it. And I was at the range prac­tis­ing that ba­sic Ho­gan’s swing for three months be­fore I went for my first round of golf.</p>
    <p>Did you play other sports in school? If so, up to what level?</p>
    <p>I would like to think I am a sports­man. I see ev­ery­thing com­pet­i­tively. I en­joy the adrenalin and testostero­ne surges in com­pe­ti­tions. It’s hi oc­tane!</p>
    <p>Foot­ball was my first pas­sion. I was a mem­ber of the St Joseph’s In­sti­tu­tion team that won the Na­tional cham­pi­onship.</p>
    <p>As a school­boy, I was re­cruited to play foot­ball for the Sin­ga­pore Cricket Club team in the Na­tional Sec­ond Divi­sion League. An an­te­rior cru­ci­ate tear on my right knee put an end to my foot­ball ca­reer and I took up squash and ten­nis.</p>
    <p>At squash, I was the Uni­ver­sity of Toronto’s cham­pion in 1980. For ten­nis, once I cap­tained the Sin­ga­pore Is­land Coun­try Club team that be­came na­tional cham­pi­ons in the B Divi­sion.</p>
    <p>How of­ten do you play th­ese days? What is your hand­i­cap and what was the low­est you have been?</p>
    <p>I used to clock in for five rounds of 9 holes plus a round of 18 weekly. To­day it’s more like two rounds of 18 a week. The low­est hand­i­cap I have been was 6.8. To­day, of­fi­cially its 8.1</p>
    <p>but I am play­ing more like an 18 and that too if I am lucky.</p>
    <p>Any mem­o­rable events in golf?</p>
    <p>When a brief from my client, Jaguar Cars, came to us that they wanted to deep dive into the golf fra­ter­nity, we told them they were rather late as Mercedes and BMW were the early movers in this space and hence have some dom­i­nance.</p>
    <p>Our ad­ver­tis­ing agency thought about it and went back to them with the cre­ative block-buster idea of hav­ing a Jaguar Golf Marathon, a 54-hole-a-day golf tour­na­ment. A first in Sin­ga­pore!</p>
    <p>Three rounds of 18 holes back to back. It was held at the Orchid Coun­try Club as they have night golf. I re­called be­ing in the last flight and I had a birdie on the 54th hole at 2.15 in the morn­ing.</p>
    <p>The Jaguar Golf tour­na­ment was a big hit and car­ried on for four more years.</p>
    <p>I look for­ward to do another Golf Marathon post Covid.</p>
    <p>Apart from two “Green Jack­ets” from Sin­ga­pore Press Hold­ings events, what other ma­jor vic­to­ries have you achieved?</p>
    <p>Apart from win­ning the Busi­ness Times Golf in 1990 and the SPH Golf Chal­lenge in 2009, I won some fringe events which are re­ally too in­signif­i­cant to chest-thump about.</p>
    <p>I was the Tan­glin Club cham­pion in 2010. I was a mem­ber of the SICC team that fin­ished na­tional cham­pi­ons for the Se­nior Divi­sion. I have won all the A, B, and C Divi­sion medals in SICC cham­pi­onships and was the win­ner for the SICC’s 300 Club Cham­pi­onship.</p>
    <p>Who is your favourite golfer?</p>
    <p>My favourite all-time golfer is Fred Cou­ples. His swing is sheer poetry in mo­tion. I like Gary Player who I played with a cou­ple of times through the in­vi­ta­tion of a bank and my good pal Ed­mund Koh.</p>
    <p>Once at a post-game re­cep­tion, Player an­nounced that I was the pretty boy be­cause of my red pants.</p>
    <p>In the game I gave him a run for his money, he gave me 18 strokes though.</p>
    <p>He is truly such a fine gen­tle­man. I re­mem­ber him say­ing to me that he does 500 sit-ups a day.</p>
    <p>Which is your favourite course (here and abroad) and why?</p>
    <p>Two golf cour­ses have my vote.</p>
    <p>One, The Com­mon­wealth Golf Club in Mel­bourne. It is truly a no­fuss, very tra­di­tional golf club. I played in the medals there a few times and the wa­gers among all golfers is but A$1 and the win­ner got a sleeve of balls.</p>
    <p>Two, The Old Course at The Hong Kong Club. I love it for its her­itage and as a very tra­di­tional old golf course. The club at­mos­phere is a bit snooty but so­phis­ti­cated. And they serve the best won-ton noo­dles soup.</p>
    <p>I also en­joyed the Cap­i­tal Club in Mel­bourne for its sheer in­dul­gence of serv­ing you lob­ster noo­dles af­ter 9 holes and a golf pro as your cad­die. Hav­ing only up to five flights a day, the course was, of course, im­mac­u­late.</p>
    <p>Once I had the priv­i­lege of play­ing at the very ex­clu­sive Ayuthayya Links in Thai­land which I must rate as the most man­i­cured golf course I have ever played on.</p>
    <p>The Red Moun­tain Golf Course in Phuket with the three-storey high drop at hole 17, par-3 is spec­tac­u­lar.</p>
    <p>Back home, Sen­tosa’s Ser­apong posts an awe­some golf chal­lenge and for my home club, SICC, I like the Old course best.</p>
    <p>I tend to lean to­wards golf cour­ses that are very tra­di­tional and old. Just like wines, I pre­fer the old world wines. The old Bukit and Sime cour­ses are very spe­cial be­cause they are cour­ses carved out of a jun­gle. The one with na­ture is pure, the eco sys­tem is or­ganic and es­tab­lished.</p>
    <p>The new golf cour­ses are but about build­ing the cour­ses first and then putting in the land­scape and the trees. It is very much like pos­tur­ing Sin­ga­pore more as a City in the Gar­den rather than a Gar­den in the City.</p>
    <p>Given a chance to play with three other play­ers in a flight, who would you choose as your flight­mates, and why?</p>
    <p>I have three groups of reg­u­lars with about 20 golfers in each group. I en­joy play­ing with them as our hand­i­caps are es­tab­lished and the chal­lenge is fair. I hate to gam­ble but I re­ally like a wa­ger.</p>
    <p>As for a fairy-tale flight, I would like the South Korean LPGA golfer Chun In Gee for her very clas­sic golf swing, Fred Cou­ples for the most beau­ti­ful golf swing in the world and my wife Shook Wah, who I still have not con­vinced to take up golf.</p>
    <p>Any holes-in-one?</p>
    <p>No plu­ral but at least a claim in the sin­gu­lar. It was on the 9th hole of the orig­i­nal New Course in SICC. This hole has since gone af­ter they re­con­structed the New Course.</p>
    <p>How­ever, I was in at least six flights, when one of my flight mates has had a hole-in one.</p>
    <p>I re­call Bill Fung, hav­ing played 33 years of pro golf, had his first ace with me at the Sime Course. Two weeks later, again with me, he had his sec­ond at the Bukit Course.</p>
    <p>Golf is said to be good for net­work­ing and busi­ness. Do you agree?</p>
    <p>Golf is great for net­work­ing and busi­ness. You have six hours to songand-dance with your busi­ness as­so­ciates.</p>
    <p>How­ever, I have al­ways be­lieved that busi­ness should be done more be­cause we bring value to each other’s ta­bles.</p>
    <p>It is great to ini­ti­ate the busi­ness,</p>
    <p>but busi­ness is busi­ness. We must in­trin­si­cally en­hance each other’s eq­uity. Any­way, I do not play diplo­matic golf. Even in busi­ness golf, I play to win no less and take the wa­ger when I can, in­tensely, be­cause that’s the spirit of com­pet­i­tive sports.</p>
    <p>I must re­late to you this de­scrip­tion when a boss chas­tised his staff for play­ing too much golf with busi­ness as­so­ciates.</p>
    <p>He said: “What busi­ness net­work­ing? At the tee box you do not talk when you tee-off. He will hook and you will slice and you go to your sep­a­rate sides of the fair­way. You both end up at the greens and you can’t talk when you putt. And this is re­peated for the next 17 holes.”</p>
    <p>If so, do you use it for your com­pany busi­ness and client build-up. Can you also give a small de­scrip­tion about your com­pany?</p>
    <p>Golf is a cul­ture. Be­sides the round of 18 holes, the af­ter-game ca­ma­raderie built is price­less. It’s great for friend­ship and bond­ing. Golf ban­ter­ing in the most witty and so­phis­ti­cated way is a po­tent lead gen­er­a­tor for busi­ness and net­work­ing op­por­tu­ni­ties.</p>
    <p>How­ever, I al­ways be­lieve that as for busi­ness, it’s all about work and more good work for each other that counts.</p>
    <p>My com­pany, Adplanet Group, has been around for more than three decades. The char­ter of the agency was to showcase that lo­cal tal­ents can be movers and shak­ers in the world of ad­ver­tis­ing.</p>
    <p>Some of the fab­u­lous tal­ents that have gone through our con­duit have been win­ners of all the ma­jor Os­cars in the in­dus­try.</p>
    <p>For more than two decades we have built the Group to be the largest lo­cal in­de­pen­dent ad agency in Sin­ga­pore. To­day, we have stream­lined to just six agen­cies in the Group.</p>
    <p>I am an ar­dent stu­dent on the Law of Di­min­ish­ing Re­turns in Eco­nom­ics and the Law of Dar­win­ism has taught me that ev­ery­thing has a prod­uct life cy­cle.</p>
    <p>The dig­i­tal­i­sa­tion of all things has brought about seis­mic changes. Con­sumer be­hav­iour is changed for­ever. Prod­uct life cy­cle is short­ened dra­mat­i­cally.</p>
    <p>Tech­nol­ogy must be seen as your clos­est friend and one has to be nim­ble, fast, flex­i­ble, and hav­ing the dare to change and see round the cor­ners to catch the new growth curves.</p>
    <p>We are go­ing into the new ab­nor­mal. Covid-19 can be seen to present many op­por­tu­ni­ties. We must set up traps to catch them.</p>
