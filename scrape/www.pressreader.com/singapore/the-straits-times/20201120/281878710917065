    <p>•</p>
    <p>Thai Prime Min­is­ter Prayut Chan-o-cha yesterday threat­ened to use all laws pos­si­ble against pro­test­ers, as demon­stra­tions es­ca­lated for his re­moval and for re­forms to curb the pow­ers of King Maha Va­ji­ra­longkorn.</p>
    <p>Ac­tivists voiced con­cern that this could mean the re­sump­tion of prose­cu­tions un­der some of the world’s harsh­est royal in­sult laws.</p>
    <p>“Prayut has de­clared a bat­tle against the peo­ple,” said rights lawyer and protest leader Arnon Nampa. “For civil ser­vants who have not cho­sen sides, you need to de­cide whether to live in the past or build a fu­ture with us.”</p>
    <p>The protests since July have be­come the great­est chal­lenge to Thai­land’s estab­lish­ment in years and have bro­ken a long­stand­ing taboo by crit­i­cis­ing the monar­chy, which can carry a jail term of up to 15 years.</p>
    <p>Mr Prayut’s an­nounce­ment came a day af­ter thou­sands of pro­test­ers threw paint at the head­quar­ters of the po­lice in what they said was a re­sponse to the use of wa­ter can­non and tear­gas that hurt dozens on Tues­day, the most vi­o­lent day of protests since July. Some pro­test­ers also sprayed an­ti­monar­chy graf­fiti.</p>
    <p>“The sit­u­a­tion is not im­prov­ing,” Mr Prayut said in a state­ment. “There is a risk of es­ca­la­tion to more vi­o­lence. If not ad­dressed, it could dam­age the coun­try and the beloved monar­chy.</p>
    <p>“The gov­ern­ment will in­ten­sify its ac­tions and use all laws, all ar­ti­cles, to take ac­tion against pro­test­ers who broke the law.”</p>
    <p>He did not spec­ify whether this in­cluded Ar­ti­cle 112 of the crim­i­nal code, which for­bids in­sult­ing the monar­chy. Mr Prayut said ear­lier in the year that it was not be­ing used for the mo­ment, at the re­quest of the King.</p>
    <p>Po­lice have been col­lect­ing ev­i­dence since July for pos­si­ble prose­cu­tions for vi­o­lat­ing the ar­ti­cle but have not taken fur­ther steps, one po­lice source said.</p>
    <p>Out­raged by the anti-monar­chy graf­fiti during Wed­nes­day’s demon­stra­tion, some roy­al­ists called for the ap­pli­ca­tion of Ar­ti­cle 112 in posts on social media.</p>
    <p>Dozens of pro­test­ers, in­clud­ing prom­i­nent lead­ers, have been ar­rested on a va­ri­ety of charges in re­cent months, though not for crit­i­cis­ing the monar­chy.</p>
    <p>There were nearly 100 prose­cu­tions for vi­o­la­tions of the royal in­sult laws un­der the junta that Mr Prayut led af­ter seiz­ing power in a 2014 coup, but there have been none since 2018, ac­cord­ing to data from rights group iLaw.</p>
    <p>Pro­test­ers ac­cused Mr Prayut of en­gi­neer­ing an elec­tion last year to stay on in power as a civil­ian prime min­is­ter. He said the bal­lot was fair.</p>
    <p>A ma­jor protest is be­ing planned at the Crown Prop­erty Bureau next Wed­nes­day over the man­age­ment of the palace for­tune, which the King has taken into his per­sonal con­trol. The fund is val­ued in the tens of bil­lions of dol­lars.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, anti-gov­ern­ment pro­test­ers are plan­ning to ex­pand their set of de­mands af­ter gen­er­at­ing what they de­scribed as sig­nif­i­cant sup­port for a move­ment that has bro­ken long-held taboos about pub­licly crit­i­cis­ing the monar­chy.</p>
    <p>The youth-led groups will also take on is­sues such as changes in crown prop­erty laws and the recog­ni­tion of same-sex mar­riage, ac­cord­ing to Mr Arnon.</p>
    <p>“Peo­ple may think that this</p>
    <p>move­ment only talks about the monar­chy – at the heart of the move­ment is ac­tu­ally equal­ity and lib­erty,” said Mr Arnon.</p>
    <p>The Par­lia­ment voted on Wed­nes­day to amend the na­tion’s Con­sti­tu­tion by set­ting up a char­ter rewrit­ing com­mit­tee, but re­jected a push by pro-democ­racy groups to in­clude changes to chap­ters govern­ing the monar­chy.</p>
    <p>And while the amend­ments may not re­sult in changes the pro­test­ers are ask­ing for, such as monar­chy re­form, it is “a l ong-term fight”, said Mr Arnon.</p>
    <p>The protests have prompted some re­ac­tion from the palace, with mem­bers of the royal fam­ily en­gag­ing with the pub­lic more of­ten in the past few months.</p>
    <p>Protest or­gan­is­ers have planned at least two key gath­er­ings early next month be­fore tak­ing a break un­til Jan­uary, said Mr Arnon.</p>
    <p>One event is ex­pected to be held on Con­sti­tu­tion Day on Dec 10, and an­other ahead of the Con­sti­tu­tional Court’s rul­ing on Mr Prayut’s qual­i­fi­ca­tion as pre­mier.</p>
    <p>If t he court dis­qual­i­fies Mr Prayut, it would be the first sign of com­pro­mise from the estab­lish­ment, said Mr Arnon.</p>
    <p>“The changes that we want to see will take some time to achieve,” he said. “Ten years from now, the gen­er­a­tion that’s protest­ing now will be the ma­jor­ity. There will be changes. They won’t be able to re­sist change.”</p>
