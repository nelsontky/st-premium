    <p>A woman, who suc­cess­fully de­fended against a defama­tion suit by a sur­geon ear­lier this year, has failed in her bid to have a com­pany sue its chief ex­ec­u­tive over its pur­chase of a fur­ther stake in the sur­geon’s pri­vate clinic.</p>
    <p>Last Thurs­day, the High Court dis­missed the ap­pli­ca­tion by Ms Serene Tiong to sue Dr Heah Sieu Min, chief ex­ec­u­tive of HC Sur­gi­cal Spe­cial­ists (HCSS), over an al­leged breach of his du­ties as a di­rec­tor to the com­pany.</p>
    <p>Ms Tiong, who holds 100 shares in the Catal­ist-listed HCSS, had brought the ac­tion in the com­pany’s name and was re­quired un­der the Com­pa­nies Act to ob­tain court ap­proval to pur­sue the case.</p>
    <p>The al­leged breach was over HCSS’ ac­qui­si­tion of an ad­di­tional in­ter­est in Ju­lian Ong En­doscopy & Surgery around Septem­ber last year.</p>
    <p>The High Court, in dis­miss­ing the ap­pli­ca­tion, also or­dered costs to be paid by Ms Tiong to the com­pany and Dr Heah. It found the ac­qui­si­tion made by the HCSS board of direc­tors to be in good faith and in the in­ter­ests of the com­pany.</p>
    <p>The court also found the ap­pli­ca­tion by Ms Tiong was not made in good faith, said the com­pany in a state­ment last Thurs­day.</p>
    <p>HCSS, rep­re­sented by Se­nior Coun­sel Tan Chee Meng, Mr Paul Loy and Ms Janie Hui from WongPart­ner­ship, said the court’s de­ci­sion “is a clear af­fir­ma­tion of its po­si­tion”. It added that any per­sonal dis­putes be­tween Ms Tiong and the sur­geon, Dr Ju­lian Ong, should be re­solved in the ap­pro­pri­ate fo­rum with­out in­volv­ing HCSS.</p>
    <p>Dr Heah said last Thurs­day: “I am pleased that the court has to­day vin­di­cated my po­si­tion.”</p>
    <p>Ms Tiong, who is rep­re­sented by lawyer Ong Ying Ping, has ap­pealed against the de­ci­sion by High Court Jus­tice Chua Lee Ming.</p>
    <p>HCSS is a med­i­cal ser­vices group pri­mar­ily en­gaged in the pro­vi­sion of en­do­scopic pro­ce­dures such as colono­scopies as well as gen­eral surgery ser­vices across 18 clin­ics.</p>
    <p>HCSS had ini­tially bought a 51 per cent stake in Ju­lian Ong En­doscopy & Surgery for $2.2 mil­lion in 2017.</p>
    <p>Last year, it bought an ad­di­tional 19 per cent for $3.8 mil­lion, mak­ing the 70 per cent-owned prac­tice a sub­sidiary of HCSS.</p>
    <p>Fol­low­ing queries from the Sin­ga­pore Ex­change, the HCSS board replied ear­lier this year that Dr Ong has “suf­fi­cient fi­nan­cial strength” to buy back the 70 per cent stake should HCSS ex­er­cise a put op­tion that re­quires him to do so. The put op­tion can be ex­er­cised if Dr Ong’s em­ploy­ment in HCSS is ter­mi­nated.</p>
    <p>In 2018, Ms Tiong had brought a com­plaint against Dr Ong to the Sin­ga­pore Med­i­cal Coun­cil (SMC), al­leg­ing that he and an­other med­i­cal spe­cial­ist had col­luded to have sex with vul­ner­a­ble women pa­tients.</p>
    <p>Dr Ong sued her for defama­tion af­ter she cir­cu­lated the com­plaint to other doc­tors, but a district judge ruled in April that Ms Tiong was jus­ti­fied. Dr Ong is ap­peal­ing against the case and the hear­ing is due in the High Court next week.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, the SMC’s In­terim Or­ders Com­mit­tee has or­dered that the reg­is­tra­tions of Dr Ong and Dr Chan Herng Nieng as med­i­cal prac­ti­tion­ers be made sub­ject to sev­eral con­di­tions for a pe­riod of 18 months from June 18, or un­til the con­clu­sion of dis­ci­plinary pro­ceed­ings against both doc­tors, which­ever is sooner.</p>
    <p>Dr Chan is the other med­i­cal spe­cial­ist who is al­leged to have col­luded with Dr Ong, as cited in Ms Tiong’s com­plaint.</p>
