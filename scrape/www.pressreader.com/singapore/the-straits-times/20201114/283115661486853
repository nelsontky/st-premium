    <p>LOS AN­GE­LES • Won­der Woman 1984, the only big movie still sched­uled to de­but in cin­e­mas this year, may ap­pear on AT&T’s HBO Max just a week or two af­ter its re­lease, ac­cord­ing to peo­ple fa­mil­iar with the mat­ter, a move that could help the new stream­ing ser­vice add sub­scribers quickly and keep the­atres open at the same time.</p>
    <p>AT&T’s Warn­erMe­dia is in the fi­nal stages of de­lib­er­a­tions over the fate of the film, which is sched­uled to open in cin­e­mas on Christ­mas Day.</p>
    <p>Re­leas­ing a movie such as Won­der Woman 1984 at home so soon af­ter it ap­pears in the­atres would have been un­think­able ear­lier this year.</p>
    <p>The movie was ex­pected to be one of the sum­mer’s big­gest hits, a fol­low-up to a film that grossed US$821.8 mil­lion (S$1.1 bil­lion) world­wide in 2017 and starred Gal Gadot as the tit­u­lar char­ac­ter.</p>
    <p>But the coro­n­avirus pan­demic has forced Hol­ly­wood to rewrite its play­book.</p>
    <p>New Warn­erMe­dia chief Ja­son Ki­lar is look­ing to ac­cel­er­ate sub­scriber growth at HBO Max, its six­month-old com­peti­tor to Net­flix and a key fo­cus for fu­ture growth.</p>
    <p>An on­line re­lease of a big DC Comics su­per­hero movie right af­ter Christ­mas could fuel sign-ups.</p>
    <p>The ser­vice fin­ished the third quar­ter with 8.6 mil­lion ac­tive users. To­gether, the HBO pay-TV net­work and HBO Max have 38 mil­lion Amer­i­can cus­tomers and 57 mil­lion world­wide.</p>
    <p>While cin­e­mas have crit­i­cised stu­dios for re­leas­ing new movies at home so soon af­ter they ap­pear in the­atres, they may be will­ing to re­lax their ob­jec­tions in this case.</p>
    <p>More the­atres risk clos­ing for the rest of the year if Warner Bros de­lays Won­der Woman 1984.</p>
    <p>Un­like its com­peti­tors, Warner Bros has been stead­fast in stick­ing with the­atri­cal re­leases dur­ing the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>While most ma­jor movies have been de­layed or put on­line faster than usual, the stu­dio chose to de­but the US$200-mil­lion Tenet in the­atres in Septem­ber.</p>
    <p>But with many lo­ca­tions closed and au­di­ences re­luc­tant to at­tend those that were open, the Christo­pher Nolan movie stum­bled, with Amer­i­can cin­e­mas con­tribut­ing just US$55.1 mil­lion to its US$350.8 mil­lion glob­ally.</p>
    <p>Not much has changed since Tenet came out. If any­thing, con­di­tions for a the­atri­cal run have de­te­ri­o­rated.</p>
    <p>The United States has seen a rise in coro­n­avirus cases over the past few weeks, lead­ing to fur­ther re­stric­tions on gath­er­ings. Cineworld Group’s Re­gal, the No. 2 chain in the US, has closed all of its do­mes­tic lo­ca­tions in­def­i­nitely.</p>
    <p>Cin­e­mas are not the only ones op­posed to home re­leases. Many film-mak­ers pre­fer to see their work on the big screen and ac­tors of­ten get paid bonuses based on a film’s fi­nan­cial per­for­mance in the­atres.</p>
    <p>But Warner Bros’ fel­low stu­dios have al­ready solved that.</p>
    <p>Walt Dis­ney, once the big­gest op­po­nent of on­line movies, has re­leased Hamil­ton and Mu­lan for view­ers at home.</p>
