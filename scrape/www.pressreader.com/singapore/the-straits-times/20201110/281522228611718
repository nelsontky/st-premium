    <p>A Covid-19 an­ti­bod­ies test kit that was de­vel­oped in Sin­ga­pore is the first to be ap­proved by the United States Food and Drug Ad­min­is­tra­tion (FDA). It can de­tect whether a per­son has an­ti­bod­ies that neu­tralise the coro­n­avirus, can be used to test if vac­cines work, check the pro­por­tion of the pop­u­la­tion that has al­ready been in­fected, and as­sist in con­tact trac­ing.</p>
    <p>A kit that de­tects whether some­one has an­ti­bod­ies which neu­tralise the coro­n­avirus, in­vented by lo­cal re­searchers, has be­come the first of its kind to re­ceive au­tho­ri­sa­tion from the United States Food and Drug Ad­min­is­tra­tion (FDA).</p>
    <p>Last Fri­day, the FDA said on its web­site that it had given emer­gency use au­tho­ri­sa­tion for the kit, known as cPass.</p>
    <p>cPass was in­vented by a team led by Pro­fes­sor Wang Linfa, direc­tor of Duke-NUS Med­i­cal School’s emerg­ing in­fec­tious diseases pro­gramme, and co-de­vel­oped with biotech com­pany GenScript Biotech Corporatio­n and the Agency for Sci­ence, Tech­nol­ogy and Re­search’s (A*Star) Di­ag­nos­tics De­vel­op­ment Hub (DxD Hub).</p>
    <p>It can be used to see if vac­cines work, check what pro­por­tion of the pop­u­la­tion has al­ready been in­fected, and as­sist in con­tact trac­ing by en­abling the health au­thor­i­ties to re­trace the steps of the virus.</p>
    <p>cPass also does not re­quire highly spe­cialised equip­ment or train­ing to use, and re­turns re­sults in just an hour.</p>
    <p>On Sun­day, Prof Wang told The Straits Times that the FDA’s ap­proval was ex­tremely sig­nif­i­cant not just for his team, but for</p>
    <p>To have the FDA ap­proval as the first and only commercial kit to de­ter­mine neu­tral­is­ing an­ti­bod­ies for Sars-CoV-2 in the world is a very high bar to reach. This is an in­cred­i­ble recog­ni­tion for our team and the Sin­ga­pore re­search and biotech land­scape. The to­tal crit­i­cal mass of Sin­ga­porean bio­med­i­cal R&D is less than 1 per cent of the (world’s), and yet we are the in­ter­na­tional leader in this area for Covid-19.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore as well.</p>
    <p>He said: “To have the FDA ap­proval as the first and only commercial kit to de­ter­mine neu­tral­is­ing an­ti­bod­ies for Sars-CoV-2 in the world is a very high bar to reach. This is an in­cred­i­ble recog­ni­tion for our team and the Sin­ga­pore re­search and biotech land­scape.</p>
    <p>“The to­tal crit­i­cal mass of Sin­ga­porean bio­med­i­cal R&D is less than 1 per cent of the (world’s), and yet we are the in­ter­na­tional leader in this area for Covid-19.”</p>
    <p>FDA said it had pre­vi­ously is­sued emer­gency use au­tho­ri­sa­tion to some 50 serol­ogy tests, which also de­tect an­ti­bod­ies.</p>
    <p>But it added that th­ese kits de­tect only the pres­ence of bind­ing an­ti­bod­ies, which bind to a virus but do not nec­es­sar­ily de­crease its abil­ity to in­fect and de­stroy cells.</p>
    <p>On the other hand, neu­tral­is­ing an­ti­bod­ies, which cPass de­tects, are thought to pre­vent the coro­n­avirus from in­fect­ing a pa­tient’s cells.</p>
    <p>Prof Wang ac­knowl­edged – as he has on pre­vi­ous oc­ca­sions – that just be­cause some­one has such an­ti­bod­ies does not mean he is im­mune to Covid-19.</p>
    <p>But “it is agreed that neu­tral­is­ing an­ti­bod­ies def­i­nitely play an im­por­tant role in grant­ing im­mu­nity... They are the only biomarker for im­mu­nity that we can prac­ti­cally mea­sure on a large scale”, he said.</p>
    <p>Dr Ti­mothy Sten­zel, direc­tor of the Of­fice of In Vitro Di­ag­nos­tics and Ra­di­o­log­i­cal Health in the FDA’s Cen­tre for De­vices and Ra­di­o­log­i­cal Health, said the abil­ity to de­tect such an­ti­bod­ies can help re­searchers gain in­sights into their im­pact on pa­tients.</p>
    <p>He said: “There are still many un­knowns about what the pres­ence of Sars-CoV-2 an­ti­bod­ies may tell us about po­ten­tial im­mu­nity, but today’s au­tho­ri­sa­tion gives us an­other tool to eval­u­ate those an­ti­bod­ies as we con­tinue to re­search and study this virus.”</p>
    <p>Prof Wang said that fol­low­ing the FDA au­tho­ri­sa­tion, Duke-NUS, DxD and GenScript will work to ex­pand the ap­pli­ca­tion and geo­graphic reach of the kits.</p>
    <p>He added that cPass will also play an im­por­tant role in the search for the ori­gin of the coro­n­avirus as it can de­tect neu­tral­is­ing an­ti­bod­ies in not just hu­mans, but any species of an­i­mals as well.</p>
    <p>He said his team has al­ready ob­tained two grants from the World Health Or­gan­i­sa­tion to work on this.</p>
    <p>DxD’s chief ex­ec­u­tive Sid­ney Yee said the hub is work­ing with labs here to de­ploy the kits lo­cally.</p>
    <p>The Straits Times has ap­proached the Health Min­istry for in­for­ma­tion on this de­ploy­ment.</p>
    <p>Prof Wang said: “Con­sid­er­ing we are ex­pect­ing many vac­cines to go into mass de­ploy­ment in the next three to six months, the mass test­ing by cPass will form an in­te­gral part of the ‘exit strat­egy’ for Sin­ga­pore and all na­tions glob­ally.”</p>
    <p>PRO­FES­SOR WANG LINFA, from Duke-NUS Med­i­cal School, who says the FDA’s ap­proval was ex­tremely sig­nif­i­cant not just for his team, but for Sin­ga­pore as well.</p>
