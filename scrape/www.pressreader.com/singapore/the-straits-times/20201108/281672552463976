    <p>DEPUTY DI­REC­TOR OF RE­SEARCH KHIN KHIN KYAW KYEE, from the Yangon-based In­sti­tute for Strat­egy and Pol­icy.</p>
    <p>Myan­mar goes to the polls to­day for the third time since the mil­i­tary loos­ened its iron grip on power.</p>
    <p>While some among the over 5,000 can­di­dates have tried to talk pol­icy, the un­prece­dented pub­lic spat over the past week be­tween the mil­i­tary and the civil­ian gov­ern­ment – which swept into of­fice after the elec­tion five years ago – has only re­in­forced the sen­ti­ment that to­day’s vote will ul­ti­mately still be about de­ter­min­ing the bal­ance of power be­tween the mil­i­tary and civil­ian politi­cians.</p>
    <p>But­tressed by the 25 per cent of par­lia­men­tary seats re­served for the mil­i­tary un­der the Con­sti­tu­tion, its proxy Union Sol­i­dar­ity and Devel­op­ment Party (USDP) is the only real chal­lenger to the rul­ing Na­tional League for Democ­racy (NLD), led by Ms Aung San Suu Kyi, to form a gov­ern­ment.</p>
    <p>Both par­ties are fight­ing on sim­i­lar turf as the NLD aligns it­self with na­tion­al­ist sen­ti­ments to strengthen its ap­peal in the Ba­mar heart­land, even at the ex­pense of alien­at­ing eth­nic mi­nori­ties.</p>
    <p>The NLD won 255 seats out of 330 at stake in the Lower House five years ago, as well as 135 of the 168 avail­able seats in the Up­per House. It is ex­pected to bag the most seats again in to­day’s vote, though it may have a harder time try­ing to reach the su­per­ma­jor­ity it sealed the last time.</p>
    <p>Oc­cu­py­ing more than half of all seats is still not enough to amend the junta-crafted Con­sti­tu­tion.</p>
    <p>Yet the NLD gov­ern­ment tried do­ing so just be­fore this elec­tion, forc­ing the mil­i­tary-ap­pointed law­mak­ers to ex­er­cise their veto power in pub­lic view.</p>
    <p>For­mer pres­i­dent and USDP chair­man Thein Sein, can­vass­ing for the party, prof­fered an olive branch of sorts re­cently when he voiced sup­port for amend­ing the coun­try’s Con­sti­tu­tion to meet peo­ple’s as­pi­ra­tions for a fed­eral democ­racy. But Myan­mar first needs a “unity gov­ern­ment” formed through “na­tional rec­on­cil­i­a­tion”, he was quoted as say­ing in lo­cal me­dia.</p>
    <p>How­ever, any no­tion of such civil­ian-mil­i­tary rap­proche­ment was de­mol­ished over the past week by com­man­der-in-chief Min Aung Hlaing’s last-minute tirade against the elec­tion com­mis­sion and gov­ern­ment, which sparked an equally ro­bust come­back from the pres­i­den­tial of­fice.</p>
    <p>Through pub­lic state­ments and a me­dia in­ter­view, the mil­i­tary chief slammed the elec­tion body’s al­leged “weak­ness and de­fi­cien­cies” and called on the gov­ern­ment to take “com­plete re­spon­si­bil­ity for all the in­ten­tional and un­in­ten­tional mis­takes of the com­mis­sion”.</p>
    <p>He did not com­mit to ac­cept­ing the elec­tion re­sults.</p>
    <p>The pres­i­den­tial of­fice called the se­nior gen­eral’s com­ments in­ap­pro­pri­ate and un­con­sti­tu­tional, prompt­ing the mil­i­tary to is­sue a veiled warn­ing about pres­i­den­tial im­peach­ment.</p>
    <p>Try­ing to lower ten­sions, Ms Suu Kyi asked sup­port­ers to stay calm.</p>
    <p>Democ­racy is not per­fect, she said in a video up­loaded on­line, but it was bet­ter com­pared with other sys­tems. Liken­ing the elec­tion to a laden mango tree with just three or four bad fruit, she said: “The sup­port of the peo­ple is im­por­tant. We have to try to plant a big tree in a safe, se­cure and right place.”</p>
    <p>Yet the out­burst was re­mark­able, push­ing into the spot­light a key as­pect of gov­er­nance in Myan­mar largely played out be­hind the scenes.</p>
    <p>Dr Min Zaw Oo, ex­ec­u­tive di­rec­tor of the Myan­mar In­sti­tute for Peace and Se­cu­rity, said: “Even though the Tat­madaw and NLD did not have a good re­la­tion­ship, there has never been such a pub­lic dis­play of dis­plea­sure be­tween the two.” The Tat­madaw is the lo­cal term for the mil­i­tary.</p>
    <p>De­spite its much-pub­li­cised short­com­ings, the elec­tion agency was quick to act against the mil­i­tary’s mouth­piece, Myawady Daily, when it pub­lished in Au­gust the se­nior gen­eral’s views on how vot­ers should se­lect can­di­dates.</p>
    <p>He had sug­gested vot­ing for peo­ple who could pro­tect race and re­li­gion, a call which vi­o­lated elec­tion rules against tap­ping the two is­sues to mo­bilise sup­port.</p>
    <p>Five years after the NLD’s first elec­tion vic­tory, the mil­i­tary’s shadow con­tin­ues to loom large in vot­ers’ minds.</p>
    <p>Ms Khin Khin Kyaw Kyee, deputy di­rec­tor of re­search at the Yangon-based In­sti­tute for Strat­egy and Pol­icy, said: “The main con­cern of the vot­ers is not to give the mil­i­tary more power. They don’t want mil­i­tary supremacy in pol­i­tics.</p>
    <p>“The cul­ture of pol­icy de­bate is still at a very nascent stage. Rather than pol­icy is­sues, the idea of ‘us’ and ‘them’ ap­pears to have more in­flu­ence on the vot­ers.”</p>
    <p>Mr Dereck Aw, Sin­ga­pore-based se­nior an­a­lyst at Con­trol Risks con­sul­tancy, said a sec­ond-term NLD gov­ern­ment will “con­tinue to walk the fine line in terms of its re­la­tion­ship with the mil­i­tary. It will hes­i­tate to chal­lenge the mil­i­tary’s en­dur­ing grip on pol­i­tics and the econ­omy”.</p>
    <p>Yet the slow-burn­ing tus­sle be­tween the two sides will also con­tinue, said an­a­lysts.</p>
    <p>Dr Min Zaw Oo sug­gested the Tat­madaw’s pub­lic re­buke was a warn­ing to the elec­tion com­mis­sion against sid­ing with the NLD in dis­putes which may arise after the elec­tion.</p>
    <p>On Fri­day, the elec­tion sub-com­mis­sion’s of­fice in Bago re­gion, north of Yangon, was hit by an ex­plo­sion. Though no one was in­jured, the at­tack and the Tat­madaw’s warn­ing have in­tro­duced an air of un­cer­tainty to a rel­a­tively sub­dued elec­tion.</p>
    <p>It served to un­der­score how frag­ile Myan­mar’s demo­cratic tran­si­tion re­mains.</p>
