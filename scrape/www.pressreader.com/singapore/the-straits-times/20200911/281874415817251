    <p>MOSCOW • Rus­sia yes­ter­day con­demned as un­ac­cept­able a US state­ment that se­nior Rus­sian of­fi­cials may have been be­hind the poi­son­ing of top Krem­lin critic Alexei Navalny.</p>
    <p>The 44-year-old lawyer and anti-cor­rup­tion cam­paigner fell ill last month af­ter board­ing a plane and was treated in Siberia be­fore med­i­cal evac­u­a­tion to Ger­many, where doc­tors said he was poi­soned.</p>
    <p>“We con­sider un­ac­cept­able any di­rect or in­di­rect sugges­tions that Rus­sian of­fi­cials were in­volved in this,” Krem­lin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said, re­spond­ing to claims made by US Sec­re­tary of State Mike Pom­peo that it was likely se­nior Rus­sian of­fi­cials or­dered the poi­son­ing of the prom­i­nent op­po­si­tion leader with Novi­chok nerve agent.</p>
    <p>“I think peo­ple all around the world see this kind of ac­tiv­ity for what it is,” Mr Pom­peo said in a ra­dio in­ter­view on Wed­nes­day.</p>
    <p>“And when they see the ef­fort to poi­son a dis­si­dent, and they recog­nise that there is a sub­stan­tial chance that this ac­tu­ally came from se­nior Rus­sian of­fi­cials, I think this is not good for the Rus­sian peo­ple.”</p>
    <p>The com­ments from Mr Pom­peo, who said the United States and its Euro­pean al­lies wanted Rus­sia to “hold those re­spon­si­ble for this ac­count­able”, came de­spite US Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump say­ing last week that he had seen no proof that Mr Navalny was poi­soned.</p>
    <p>Mr Peskov yes­ter­day stressed that Rus­sia had “an in­ter­est in find­ing the rea­sons for what hap­pened” to Mr Navalny.</p>
    <p>He re­peated com­plaints that Rus­sia had not re­ceived in­for­ma­tion from Ger­many on the find­ings of med­i­cal tests that led it to con­clude that he was poi­soned. He added that Rus­sian of­fi­cials were seek­ing co­op­er­a­tion with Ger­many but did not see their ef­forts be­ing re­cip­ro­cated.</p>
    <p>Rus­sia has not opened a crim­i­nal in­ves­ti­ga­tion into what hap­pened to the high-pro­file politi­cian be­cause it said its own med­i­cal tests had found no poi­son.</p>
    <p>A day ear­lier, Rus­sia had is­sued a strong protest to Ger­many, de­nounc­ing what it said were base­less claims and warn­ing of a ma­jor risk to diplo­matic ties.</p>
    <p>The For­eign Min­istry in Moscow said it had sum­moned Ger­man am­bas­sador Geza An­dreas von Geyr and protested against “un­founded ac­cu­sa­tions and ul­ti­ma­tums against Rus­sia” and the “ob­vi­ous use of (Mr Navalny’s) sit­u­a­tion by Ber­lin as a pre­text to dis­credit our coun­try”.</p>
    <p>It said fail­ure to pro­vide ev­i­dence of its al­le­ga­tions against Rus­sia would be seen as a “gross hos­tile provo­ca­tion” that would be “fraught with con­se­quences for Rus­sian-Ger­man re­la­tions”.</p>
    <p>Mr Navalny be­came ill while lead­ing a tac­ti­cal vot­ing cam­paign aimed at push­ing out the rul­ing party’s can­di­dates in lo­cal elec­tions.</p>
    <p>Krem­lin spokesman Dmitry Peskov yes­ter­day stressed that Rus­sia had “an in­ter­est in find­ing the rea­sons for what hap­pened” to Mr Alexei Navalny.
