    <p>MAR­SEILLE An­dre Vil­las-Boas loves Mar­seille and the Ligue 1 gi­ants’ sup­port­ers love him for end­ing their seven-year ab­sence from the Cham­pi­ons League, in which they host Manch­ester City to­day.</p>
    <p>There was a once a time, a decade ago now, when “AVB” and Pep Guardi­ola were the two most cov­eted coaches in Europe, both win­ning Euro­pean tro­phies i n the same 2010-11 sea­son in charge of Porto and Barcelona re­spec­tively.</p>
    <p>The Por­tuguese t hen shared some of the same ref­er­ence points as the Spa­niard.</p>
    <p>Both crossed paths with Jose Mour­inho in the early years of their ca­reers and Bobby Rob­son was a men­tor to both, giv­ing Vil­las-Boas work in the scout­ing depart­ment at Porto and then mak­ing Guardi­ola a cen­tral part of his team at Barcelona.</p>
    <p>While Guardi­ola led Barca to win the Cham­pi­ons League in 2011, Vil­las-Boas won four ti­tles with Porto, in­clud­ing the Europa League.</p>
    <p>The pair could have crossed swords the fol­low­ing sea­son, but Vil­las-Boas was sacked by Chelsea, with the Blues go­ing on to beat Barca in the semi-fi­nals en route to their maiden Cham­pi­ons League crown that cam­paign.</p>
    <p>His ca­reer has not quite scaled the ex­pected heights af­ter that, hav­ing also been fired by Tot­ten­ham, while Guardi­ola has gone on to claim mul­ti­ple tro­phies at Bay­ern Mu­nich and City.</p>
    <p>How­ever, their paths will now meet, and Vil­las-Boas is hop­ing to out­fox Guardi­ola.</p>
    <p>Mar­seille are up against them af­ter los­ing to Olympiakos last week, while City beat Porto to lead Group C. But Vil­las-Boas still feels a toptwo fin­ish to guar­an­tee a spot in the knock­out phase is up for grabs.</p>
    <p>“We can com­pete in this group,” the 43-year-old said. “I like to aim high. We dreamt of be­ing in this com­pe­ti­tion, so now we are tar­get­ing the last 16.”</p>
    <p>Mar­seille re­main the only Ligue 1 team to have won the com­pe­ti­tion in 1993 and hav­ing al­ready beaten French cham­pi­ons Paris Saint-Ger­main in the league for the first time in nine years this term, Vil­las-Boas is con­sid­er­ing a con­tract ex­ten­sion. “The most im­por­tant thing is that I am very happy here. I am emo­tion­ally at­tached to this club, to its his­tory, the play­ers who have played here, its im­pact in Europe,” he said.</p>
