    <p>When Ms Ziyi Sheena Cheong signed up for a chil­dren’s book subscripti­on ser­vice in Jan­uary, she did not re­alise how use­ful it would turn out to be.</p>
    <p>At the time, the busy mum of two wanted to find age-ap­pro­pri­ate ti­tles and was im­pressed by the de­tailed ques­tions from One Happy Book. Chace, four, and Scar­lett, two, were “ab­so­lutely de­lighted” by their monthly package of sur­prises, she says.</p>
    <p>Their subscripti­on proved a god­send dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker, when they read twice a day.</p>
    <p>“The kids and I got to spend qual­ity time. They loved point­ing at the il­lus­tra­tions and they pre­tended to know how to read the words – they’re still learning – but it was very nice,” says Ms Cheong, 34, a florist who runs For Peo­ple­Who Love Flow­ers.</p>
    <p>“It helped ac­com­pany us dur­ing the day and in the evening when we were get­ting them ready for bed. Af­ter read­ing them over and over again many times, I gift them to my friends’ kids so the books get love over and over again.”</p>
    <p>The pandemic has re­newed in­ter­est in such subscripti­on boxes for kids as fam­i­lies spend more time at home and par­ents seek out mean­ing­ful ways to en­gage their lit­tle ones. While there are many over­seas-based ser­vices, there are now at least seven home-grown sup­pli­ers, of­ten helmed by par­ents who see a busi­ness op­por­tu­nity based on their own par­ent­ing needs.</p>
    <p>Th­ese lo­cal busi­nesses of­fer ev­ery­thing from sen­sory play kits to Montes­sori learning packs and Chi­nese ac­tiv­i­ties. Ear­lier this month on Oct 2, the Na­tional Li­brary Board (NLB) pi­loted its ver­sion of this, called The Lit­tle Book Box, which de­liv­ers eight English-lan­guage chil­dren’s books to cus­tomers every month for a fee of $10.70. The ser­vice will run from next month un­til July next year.</p>
    <p>All 1,000 slots were snapped up in five days – the fig­ure in­cludes 200 sub­scrip­tions spon­sored by The Straits Times School Pocket Money Fund for chil­dren from low-in­come fam­i­lies. The NLB is “heart­ened by the over­whelm­ing re­sponse” says its chief ex­ec­u­tive Ng Cher Pong, who adds that it un­der­scores “the im­por­tance of cul­ti­vat­ing the love for read­ing at home”.</p>
    <p>My Messy Box, one of the early play­ers, was born in 2013 when Mr Jeff Lim re­alised that his son, Me­dion, then aged two, had is­sues with fine mo­tor skills such as pick­ing up small items. Sen­sory play helped the boy, but Mr Lim, 34, had trou­ble find­ing rel­e­vant ac­tiv­i­ties, so he cre­ated his own.</p>
    <p>Seven years on, he has two full­time teach­ers who plan the themes for each month’s box, which he says mod­els the Min­istry of Ed­u­ca­tion’s Nur­tur­ing Early Learn­ers frame­work for pre-school­ers.</p>
    <p>The busi­ness has grown from 50 boxes ini­tially to “a few hun­dred boxes world­wide” every month now, ship­ping to des­ti­na­tions such as Malaysia, Hong Kong and the United States. De­mand “more than dou­bled” dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker, he reports.</p>
    <p>“There were many who even re­quested for boxes to be sent to them in ad­vance, but it wasn’t easy at that time as the global sup­ply chain was af­fected greatly by the pandemic,” says Mr Lim, who also has a seven-year-old daugh­ter.</p>
    <p>Mr Austen Ho, 43, co-founder of Squizzel Box, was wor­ried about the pandemic damp­en­ing de­mand for his learning pack­ages.</p>
    <p>But his fears were un­founded. At one point, he was fully sold out and cus­tomers told him “the boxes were a life­saver” dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker.</p>
    <p>“We also had in­quiries from preschools, as they wanted learning to con­tinue for the pre-school­ers at home,” says the fa­ther of three kids aged two to nine.</p>
    <p>While Mr Ho and a part­ner started Squizzel Box in April last year be­cause they wanted their chil­dren to love hands-on learning and avoid screen time, their busi­ness cre­ated new op­por­tu­ni­ties be­yond just ser­vic­ing par­ents.</p>
    <p>In Fe­bru­ary, they branched out into cre­at­ing cus­tomised learning kits with or­gan­i­sa­tions, such as a Bub­bles Life­long Learning Kit ac­tiv­ity package for peo­ple with dis­abil­i­ties that was com­mis­sioned by the Move­ment for the In­tel­lec­tu­ally Dis­abled of Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, four-year-old Josh & Cherie Books has ex­panded be­yond book sub­scrip­tions over the years to in­clude ed­u­ca­tional toys and games, Chi­nese books and even an e-com­merce dis­count book­store, Friendly Gi­ant Books, for cus­tomers who want to choose their own books or buy ad­di­tional ti­tles.</p>
    <p>Co-founder Ch­eryl Ang, 29, says the busi­ness has sent books to more than 5,000 read­ers to date and is grow­ing at about 15 per cent an­nu­ally. The cir­cuit breaker boosted its subscriber base by 20 per cent.</p>
    <p>One Happy Book, the brain­child of sis­ters Shan­ice Goh, 33, and Sh­er­nice Goh, 28, plans to ex­pand be­yond Sin­ga­pore and In­done­sia as their 11/ -year-old ven­ture gains 2 vis­i­bil­ity.</p>
    <p>Ms Shan­ice Goh, who has a 14-month-old tod­dler, says au­thors of il­lus­trated chil­dren’s books have started con­tact­ing them to add their ti­tles to their prod­uct range.</p>
    <p>She is not wor­ried about the NLB’s foray into the mar­ket, as she be­lieves that par­ents are “in­creas­ingly con­scious of their child’s hy­giene” dur­ing the pandemic and ap­pre­ci­ate books that are new and al­low sen­sory stim­u­la­tion.</p>
    <p>“To a very young baby, that can even in­clude bit­ing the edge of a book,” she ex­plains.</p>
    <p>Some par­ents like ad­min­is­tra­tive of­fi­cer Hu Huit­ing, 38, ap­pre­ci­ate the con­ve­nience of subscripti­on boxes so much that they have signed up with mul­ti­ple ven­dors. Ms Hu sub­scribed to Squizzel Box for her 51/ 2- year-old son Hao Jun just over a year ago and is also await­ing her first package from NLB’s new ser­vice. Her son re­ceives Ki­wiCo Box from the United States as well, as she likes its en­gi­neer­ing-ori­ented ac­tiv­i­ties.</p>
    <p>De­scrib­ing them as “great bond­ing ac­tiv­i­ties”, she says such boxes have helped Hao Jun gain con­fi­dence, boost his mo­tor and lit­er­acy skills and in­crease his gen­eral knowl­edge.</p>
    <p>“It’s re­ally learning through play.”</p>
