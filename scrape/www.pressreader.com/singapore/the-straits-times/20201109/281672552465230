    <p>Ev­ery two years, over 2,000 men and women in white con­gre­gate for the rul­ing Peo­ple’s Ac­tion Party (PAP) con­fer­ence, where they elect the party’s top de­ci­sion-mak­ing body and map the way for­ward.</p>
    <p>But un­like pre­vi­ous con­fer­ences, the PAP cadres cast their votes yes­ter­day in a distribute­d man­ner amid the Covid-19 pan­demic and news that a deeply di­vi­sive election had pro­duced a new US pres­i­dent.</p>
    <p>Education Min­is­ter Lawrence Wong and Na­tional Devel­op­ment Min­is­ter Des­mond Lee – who have won plau­dits for their lead­er­ship and per­son­able ap­proach dur­ing the cri­sis – be­came the lat­est two min­is­ters to be in­ducted into the party’s cen­tral ex­ec­u­tive com­mit­tee.</p>
    <p>Prime Min­is­ter Lee Hsien Loong stressed the ev­er­green im­por­tance of trust which is but­tressed by solid work. “In pol­i­tics there is no sub­sti­tute for the hard, pa­tient work of reach­ing out to peo­ple, solv­ing their prob­lems, win­ning their trust and con­fi­dence,” he said.</p>
    <p>At last year’s party gath­er­ing – in al­ter­nate years, where there is no vot­ing, it is called a con­ven­tion – PM Lee too, spoke of trust, out­lin­ing what the party must do to keep the elec­torate’s faith in it, give peo­ple hope for the fu­ture, and en­sure so­cial co­he­sion amid an ero­sion of trust in the po­lit­i­cal class and es­tab­lish­ments around the world.</p>
    <p>An­other key point of the speeches by PM Lee and PAP first as­sis­tant sec­re­tary-gen­eral Heng Swee Keat yes­ter­day was on en­gage­ment. While there is no ques­tion that the party has to de­liver com­pe­tent govern­ment and sub­stan­tive poli­cies, PM Lee said that “good poli­cies must be ac­com­pa­nied by good pol­i­tics”. In short, the Govern­ment is not just an ad­min­is­tra­tor, but also a bea­con and gal­vanis­ing force.</p>
    <p>“The PAP must pro­vide Sin­ga­pore­ans with strong po­lit­i­cal lead­er­ship. To im­bue Sin­ga­pore­ans with de­ter­mi­na­tion and con­fi­dence. To put our peo­ple at the cen­tre of ev­ery­thing we do, lis­ten to their as­pi­ra­tions and anx­i­eties, and light a can­dle for them in this hour of dark­ness,” he said.</p>
    <p>He added that the party must adapt to what Sin­ga­pore­ans want in their pol­i­tics. While sta­bil­ity and job se­cu­rity may be paramount, in­creas­ingly, Sin­ga­pore­ans want other things too – from par­tic­i­pat­ing more ac­tively in shap­ing so­ci­ety, to the closer scru­tiny of govern­ment poli­cies and more ro­bust pub­lic de­bates. “These ex­pec­ta­tions and de­sires will only grow with ev­ery gen­er­a­tion of Sin­ga­pore­ans,” he said.</p>
    <p>Deputy Prime Min­is­ter Heng broke this down fur­ther by de­scrib­ing what forms of en­gage­ment are needed, beyond the tra­di­tional method of walk­ing the ground. This in­cludes en­gag­ing res­i­dents on the­matic is­sues such as jobs and sus­tain­abil­ity. It also means strength­en­ing on­line out­reach, some­thing which some an­a­lysts saw as the PAP’s weak­ness dur­ing GE2020.</p>
    <p>Mr Heng ac­knowl­edged that the PAP must have a stronger pres­ence on­line, and that it will take “ex­per­i­men­ta­tion and imag­i­na­tion” to adapt its con­tent and mes­sag­ing in new ways.</p>
    <p>But even amid much-needed change, PM Lee took care to make a third key point: There will be con­ti­nu­ity and sta­bil­ity in lead­er­ship suc­ces­sion. His state­ment comes after for­mer se­nior min­is­ter S. Jayaku­mar posed an in­trigu­ing ques­tion last week, on whether the PM will re­visit his ear­lier in­ten­tion not to lead the PAP into the next GE, should Sin­ga­pore still be suf­fer­ing from the pan­demic fall­out. PM Lee had said he hopes to step down by the time he turns 70, which would be in Fe­bru­ary 2022.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, PM Lee as­sured Sin­ga­pore­ans that lead­er­ship re­newal re­mains one of his top pri­or­i­ties, and re­it­er­ated his in­ten­tion to see the coun­try through the cri­sis. “It is my duty to see our na­tion through this cri­sis, be­fore I hand over re­spon­si­bil­ity for Sin­ga­pore in good shape to the next team and into safe hands,” he said, urg­ing Sin­ga­pore­ans to sup­port him and his team.</p>
    <p>The speeches yes­ter­day were a tacit ac­knowl­edge­ment by the party lead­er­ship that form mat­ters in ad­di­tion to func­tion. Like it or not, the op­tics and process of en­gage­ment can af­fect whether a pol­icy is em­braced. They were also a call to mem­bers to em­body the PAP’s ac­tivist roots. PM Lee re­minded them the party be­gan as one of the work­ers and unions, and it must ig­nite its found­ing ethos: “You must have guts, you must have con­vic­tion, you must have that spunk and that fight.”</p>
    <p>And they called for unity, recog­nis­ing that Sin­ga­pore­ans are not mono­lithic, nor is pol­i­tics here ir­re­vo­ca­bly par­ti­san or un­sta­ble.</p>
    <p>The re­sults of an In­sti­tute of Pol­icy Stud­ies sur­vey re­leased last month showed vot­ers in the swing cat­e­gory, de­fined as be­ing mixed in their views com­pared with plu­ral­ists and con­ser­va­tives, rose sharply in GE2020. Plu­ral­ists, or those who firmly de­sire more po­lit­i­cal di­ver­sity, rose just slightly, with more of them emerg­ing among the less-ed­u­cated and lower-in­come.</p>
    <p>This shows vot­ers here gen­er­ally do not hew to ex­treme po­lit­i­cal po­si­tions, and the de­sire for more po­lit­i­cal di­ver­sity has bread-and-but­ter is­sues at its root. Hence the em­pha­sis of PAP lead­ers yes­ter­day that the party must con­tinue to rep­re­sent the broad mid­dle ground in Sin­ga­pore pol­i­tics.</p>
    <p>With these in mind, those who pre­dict the de­cline of the PAP, given its loss of an­other group rep­re­sen­ta­tion con­stituency this year, have much to chew on.</p>
    <p>The party has no lack of re­solve and re­sources. And with the right ap­proach, it can – and has stated it wants to – wrest back the ground that it has ceded.</p>
