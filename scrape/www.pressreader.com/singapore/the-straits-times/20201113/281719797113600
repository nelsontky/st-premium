    <p>The Pfizer re­sult “val­i­dates the mRNA plat­form”, said Dr An­thony Fauci, direc­tor of the Na­tional In­sti­tute of Al­lergy and In­fec­tious Dis­eases and the US gov­ern­ment’s top in­fec­tious dis­ease doc­tor, in a call with re­porters on Mon­day. “Moderna is an mRNA can­di­date, which we would ex­pect to have sim­i­lar re­sults.”</p>
    <p>NEW YORK • Now it is Moderna’s time to be in the spot­light.</p>
    <p>The same United States ex­plo­sion of Covid-19 cases that helped Pfizer get re­sults for its vac­cine trial ear­lier this week is help­ing speed along Moderna’s trial.</p>
    <p>Moderna said on Wed­nes­day its study has ac­cu­mu­lated more than 53 in­fec­tions, al­low­ing a pre­lim­i­nary anal­y­sis of the shot’s ef­fec­tive­ness to be­gin.</p>
    <p>The shares jumped. Moderna did not pre­dict how long it could take an in­de­pen­dent mon­i­tor­ing com­mit­tee to an­a­lyse the data, but said the com­pany could get the data to the com­mit­tee within days.</p>
    <p>The com­pany said it is still blinded to the data.</p>
    <p>“Moderna has seen a sig­nif­i­cant in­crease in the rate of case iden­ti­fi­ca­tion across sites in the last week,” the com­pany said in a state­ment.</p>
    <p>“As a re­sult, the com­pany ex­pects the first in­terim anal­y­sis will in­clude sub­stan­tially more than 53 cases, the tar­geted trig­ger point for the anal­y­sis.”</p>
    <p>The pre­lim­i­nary data on Moderna’s study is be­ing pre­pared for sub­mis­sion to the mon­i­tor­ing board, it said.</p>
    <p>The board will say whether the vac­cine is ef­fec­tive, does not work, or that the trial should con­tinue be­cause the re­sults are in­con­clu­sive.</p>
    <p>The bet among top ex­perts in the field is that Moderna’s ther­apy, which uses a sim­i­lar mRNA tech­nol­ogy to Pfizer’s, will likely prove to be highly ef­fec­tive, per­haps mir­ror­ing Pfizer’s an­nounce­ment ear­lier this week that its shot ap­pears to be more than 90 per cent ef­fec­tive.</p>
    <p>“Over­all, I would ex­pect sim­i­lar re­sults” in Moderna’s trial, said Dr</p>
    <p>Drew Weiss­man, an im­mu­nol­o­gist and mRNA ex­pert at the Uni­ver­sity of Penn­syl­va­nia, who helped develop key mod­i­fi­ca­tions used in mRNA vac­cines.</p>
    <p>“It is hard to imag­ine how it would be much dif­fer­ent,” ac­cord­ing to Dr Weiss­man, whose lab re­ceives re­search fund­ing from BioN­Tech, the com­pany part­ner­ing with Pfizer on its vac­cine.</p>
    <p>In vac­cine tri­als, a cer­tain num­ber of vol­un­teers – a per­cent­age of which get a placebo – have to get in­fected in or­der to de­ter­mine if the</p>
    <p>vac­cine works.</p>
    <p>That is eas­ier to ac­com­plish with the pan­demic in the US hit­ting record in­fec­tions on a daily ba­sis.</p>
    <p>Pfizer got a burst of re­sults in re­cent weeks that pushed that trial over the line to take a first look.</p>
    <p>Now Moderna’s in­terim anal­y­sis could come within days.</p>
    <p>What­ever hap­pens in the trial – and there are no guar­an­tees un­til it is done – the re­sults are cer­tain to have a big im­pact on Moderna shares, which have more than quadru­pled this year in a wild</p>
    <p>roller-coaster ride.</p>
    <p>The stock closed up 8.4 per cent in New York trad­ing on Wed­nes­day. The shares yes­ter­day rose an­other 5 per cent in pre-mar­ket trad­ing.</p>
    <p>A pre­lim­i­nary anal­y­sis in Moderna’s trial would likely have al­ready been avail­able if the shot was only 60 per cent ef­fec­tive, ac­cord­ing to re­search firm Airfin­ity.</p>
    <p>If the Moderna vac­cine turns out to be 90 per cent ef­fec­tive, how­ever, that time­line would be ex­panded and Moderna would be get­ting re­sults around now, Airfin­ity said.</p>
    <p>The more ef­fec­tive a vac­cine is, the longer it takes for cases to add up since there would be fewer in­fec­tions in the half of par­tic­i­pants who got the vac­cine rather than a placebo.</p>
    <p>The strong sim­i­lar­ity with the suc­cess­ful Pfizer vac­cine is boost­ing con­fi­dence i n Moderna’s, which was de­vel­oped in con­cert with the US Na­tional In­sti­tute of Al­lergy and In­fec­tious Dis­eases (NIAID).</p>
    <p>The Pfizer re­sult “val­i­dates the mRNA plat­form”, said Dr An­thony Fauci, direc­tor of the NIAID and the US gov­ern­ment’s top in­fec­tious dis­ease doc­tor, in a call with re­porters on Mon­day.</p>
    <p>“Moderna is an mRNA can­di­date, which we would ex­pect to have sim­i­lar re­sults.”</p>
    <p>Moderna’s fi­nal-stage trial started on the same day as Pfizer’s big trial in late July.</p>
    <p>The com­pany is slightly be­hind Pfizer largely due to struc­tural dif­fer­ences in the tri­als.</p>
