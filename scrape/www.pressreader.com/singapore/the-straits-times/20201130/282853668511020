    <p>Aries (March 21 - April 19)</p>
    <p>De­tails are ag­gra­vat­ing. You have to skip past them or del­e­gate them to some­one with more pa­tience. Keep your eyes on the big pic­ture.</p>
    <p>Tau­rus (April 20 - May 20)</p>
    <p>Now is the time to talk to your peo­ple about how you are feel­ing. Com­mu­ni­ca­tion is the best way to resolve what is wrong.</p>
    <p>Gem­ini (May 21 - June 20)</p>
    <p>You have too much go­ing on, but you love it. Your amaz­ing en­ergy helps you cope with stress, and you should amaze with stun­ning feats of der­ring-do.</p>
    <p>Cancer (June 21 - July 22)</p>
    <p>You are cranky. When your friend or col­league de­liv­ers a mono­logue that you can­not es­cape, try to breathe and re­lax.</p>
    <p>Leo (July 23 - Aug 22)</p>
    <p>A hot idea comes from out of nowhere. Even if it can­not work out on its own, you may be able to work it into a larger scheme or plan.</p>
    <p>Virgo (Aug 23 - Sept 22)</p>
    <p>You are smart as a whip, and your quick mind is ready for al­most any prob­lem. Trust your first in­stinct, though you may want to re­view what hap­pened.</p>
    <p>Li­bra (Sept 23 - Oct 22)</p>
    <p>You are see­ing things from two dif­fer­ent per­spec­tives and that could mean you have the so­lu­tion to a thorny prob­lem. Good luck ex­plain­ing it, though.</p>
    <p>Scor­pio (Oct 23 - Nov 21)</p>
    <p>You are feel­ing tempted by some­thing that feels bet­ter than what you have. Think hard be­fore mak­ing a switch as you are more eas­ily swayed at this time.</p>
    <p>Sagit­tar­ius (Nov 22 - Dec 21)</p>
    <p>You are feel­ing the need for con­ver­sa­tion. Seek out a good friend or wise rel­a­tive who can hear you out. You should feel bet­ter af­ter­wards.</p>
    <p>Capri­corn (Dec 22 - Jan 19)</p>
    <p>Your main prob­lem can be solved by let­ting go of some­thing, or clear­ing out a phys­i­cal or men­tal space that has be­come clut­tered.</p>
    <p>Aquar­ius (Jan 20 - Feb 18)</p>
    <p>You have strong feel­ings for some­one you share in­tel­lec­tual in­ter­ests with. This could lead to ro­mance, or al­most any­where, re­ally.</p>
    <p>Pisces (Feb 19 - March 20)</p>
    <p>Cre­ative pow­ers are yours, though you are feel­ing more like a big-pic­ture per­son than a de­tail wran­gler. Try to get oth­ers to han­dle the lit­tle stuff for now.</p>
