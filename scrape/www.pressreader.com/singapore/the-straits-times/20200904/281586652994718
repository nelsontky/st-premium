    <p>Dis­ease X, a new un­known dis­ease that could cause a fu­ture epi­demic, should be seen as a se­ri­ous threat to drive pre­pared­ness – as it will be highly in­fec­tious, dead­lier than Covid-19 and will mu­tate eas­ily, said lo­cal health ex­perts. Prime Min­is­ter Lee Hsien Loong has said that Sin­ga­pore must build up its re­silience and pre­pared­ness to counter Dis­ease X when it ar­rives.</p>
    <p>Dis­ease X, a new un­known dis­ease that could cause a fu­ture epi­demic, should be seen as a se­ri­ous threat to drive pre­pared­ness – as it will be highly in­fec­tious, dead­lier than Covid-19 and will mu­tate eas­ily, said lo­cal health ex­perts.</p>
    <p>For now, it is more a hy­po­thet­i­cal con­cept to warn peo­ple of a worse new dis­ease to en­able plan­ning, said Pro­fes­sor Dale Fisher, a se­nior con­sul­tant at the divi­sion of in­fec­tious dis­eases at the Na­tional Univer­sity Hospi­tal.</p>
    <p>Prime Min­is­ter Lee Hsien Loong raised the spec­tre of the emer­gence of Dis­ease X dur­ing the de­bate on the Pres­i­dent’s Ad­dress in Par­lia­ment on Wed­nes­day.</p>
    <p>He warned that it is only a mat­ter of time be­fore Dis­ease X hap­pens, say­ing that Covid-19 is by far not the worst new dis­ease that can be­fall mankind.</p>
    <p>He said Sin­ga­pore must build up its re­silience, in­stincts and pre­pared­ness to counter Dis­ease X when it ar­rives.</p>
    <p>Com­ment­ing on PM Lee’s re­marks, Prof Fisher said: “It is also po­ten­tially use­ful in driv­ing pre­pared­ness ef­forts and not be­ing com­pla­cent as the world is most at risk from novel in­fec­tions or ma­jor mu­ta­tions in ex­ist­ing mi­cro-or­gan­isms and less so from pathogens we al­ready know about, such as Ebola.”</p>
    <p>Whether or not Covid-19 is seen as Dis­ease X, Prof Fisher said what is more crit­i­cal is the na­tional and global re­sponse to tackle the cur­rent pan­demic and how this could be im­proved should a sim­i­lar or more se­vere pan­demic emerge.</p>
    <p>As­so­ciate Pro­fes­sor Alex Cook, vice-dean of re­search at the Na­tional Univer­sity of Sin­ga­pore’s (NUS) Saw Swee Hock School of Pub­lic Health, noted that Covid-19 has some fea­tures as­so­ci­ated with Dis­ease X.</p>
    <p>“It is a new virus, caused a res­pi­ra­tory dis­ease pan­demic, and it wasn’t in­fluenza. Its mode of trans­mis­sion wasn’t known at first, nor was its symp­toma­tol­ogy or sever­ity pro­file. We still don’t know about im­mu­nity to Sars-CoV-2.</p>
    <p>“It is also se­vere enough to cause many deaths but not too se­vere that it is easy to con­trol, like the se­vere acute res­pi­ra­tory syn­drome (Sars),” said Prof Cook.</p>
    <p>All these un­cer­tain­ties make it dif­fi­cult for coun­tries to shape poli­cies and im­ple­men­ta­tion, re­sult­ing in them stum­bling in the dark with their re­sponses, Prof Cook said.</p>
    <p>But he cau­tioned that it would be rash to think that the next in­fec­tious dis­ease threat will be Covid-like, as the pos­si­bil­i­ties are end­less.</p>
    <p>“It could be a new in­fluenza virus, like the one that caused the 1918 pan­demic, killing tens of mil­lions of peo­ple.</p>
    <p>“It could also be some­thing more se­vere, in the mould of Sars, the Mid­dle East res­pi­ra­tory syn­drome or the Ni­pah virus,” he said.</p>
    <p>The worst night­mare would be a virus which is very trans­mis­si­ble, like in­fluenza, and as deadly as Sars, like the hy­po­thet­i­cal Mev-1 virus in the film Con­ta­gion, he posited</p>
    <p>“So while Covid-19 has been a disaster for the world, with al­most a mil­lion deaths, the next big one will be dif­fer­ent – and could be worse.</p>
    <p>“I think that is why PM Lee cau­tioned us not to think of Covid-19 as Dis­ease X,” added Prof Cook.</p>
    <p>Ex­perts said the ex­pe­ri­ence from previous in­fec­tions has def­i­nitely taught Sin­ga­pore var­i­ous lessons.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore learnt the im­por­tance of equip­ping health­care work­ers ad­e­quately to pro­tect them against in­fec­tions orig­i­nat­ing from a hospi­tal while on the job, hav­ing gone through the Sars ex­pe­ri­ence.</p>
    <p>That pan­demic saw in­fec­tions spread from pa­tients to health­care work­ers in Sin­ga­pore, said Pro­fes­sor Teo Yik Ying, dean of the NUS Saw Swee Hock School of Pub­lic Health.</p>
    <p>It also led to the set­ting up of a ded­i­cated health­care fa­cil­ity – the Na­tional Centre for In­fec­tious Dis­eases – to look af­ter those with res­pi­ra­tory in­fec­tions, as well as stock­pil­ing ad­e­quate es­sen­tial per­sonal pro­tec­tive equip­ment, which proved to be crit­i­cal in an out­break, Prof Teo added.</p>
    <p>These helped to keep Sin­ga­pore’s Covid-19 fa­tal­i­ties and in­fec­tion rates among health­care work­ers one of the low­est in the world.</p>
    <p>Other lessons gained were in pro­tect­ing the com­mu­nity from a highly in­fec­tious agent and the pro­to­cols to min­imise in­fec­tion among vul­ner­a­ble groups like those in old folks’ home and dor­mi­to­ries, such as mask wear­ing, safe dis­tanc­ing, good per­sonal hy­giene and ag­gres­sive con­tact trac­ing and ring-fenc­ing, Prof Teo said.</p>
    <p>Prof Cook said Covid-19 also called for new poli­cies fol­low­ing lock­downs in Wuhan, China, and Sin­ga­pore’s cir­cuit breaker.</p>
    <p>“In the years ahead, there will be a lot of re­search on what worked and what didn’t, though it be­hoves us not to over-ex­trap­o­late from the Covid-19 ex­pe­ri­ence for Dis­ease X and to al­ways stay nim­ble in our re­sponse,” he said.</p>
    <p>BE PRE­PARED</p>
    <p>So while Covid-19 has been a disaster for the world, with al­most a mil­lion deaths, the next big one will be dif­fer­ent – and could be worse.</p>
    <p>I think that is why PM Lee cau­tioned us not to think of Covid-19 as Dis­ease X.</p>
