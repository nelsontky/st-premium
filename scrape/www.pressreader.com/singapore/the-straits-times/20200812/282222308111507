    <p>COLOGNE • Manch­ester United man­ager Ole Gun­nar Sol­sk­jaer hopes his team can make it third time lucky and reach their first fi­nal of the season af­ter steer­ing United to the Europa League semi-fi­nals af­ter a 1-0 ex­tra-time win over FC Copenhagen on Mon­day.</p>
    <p>The Red Devils laboured to dis­pose of the Dan­ish side in reg­u­la­tion time and needed a 95thminute penalty – their 21st of the season and con­verted by Bruno Fer­nan­des – to book a semi-fi­nal clash with ei­ther Pre­mier League ri­vals Wolves or La Liga out­fit Sevilla, who played each other yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>That semi-fi­nal will take place on Sun­day in Cologne and Sol­sk­jaer, chas­ing his first sil­ver­ware as United boss, be­lieves his side must learn from their League Cup semi-fi­nal de­feat by Manch­ester City and FA Cup last-four loss to Chelsea.</p>
    <p>“We need to be more clin­i­cal in knock­out games,” the Nor­we­gian said. “I am de­lighted we are through to an­other semi-fi­nal for this team and the next chal­lenge is to go one step fur­ther, and then hope­fully, win the last one (the fi­nal), too.</p>
    <p>“We have worked hard through­out the season, and come quite a dis­tance from where we were in terms of fit­ness, but men­tally, that is where they (the semi-fi­nals) are de­cided.”</p>
    <p>Sol­sk­jaer, how­ever, ad­mit­ted he was con­cerned by United’s muted dis­play against un­fan­cied Copenhagen, whose goal­keeper Karl-Jo­han Johns­son made 13 saves, the most by a ’keeper in a sin­gle Europa League game since 2009.</p>
    <p>While United had plenty of chances, their fin­ish­ing left much to be de­sired – they twice hit the post while two other strikes were dis­al­lowed for off­side – as the players strug­gled to cope with the en­ergy-sap­ping con­di­tions.</p>
    <p>“We’re used to hav­ing the best fa­cil­i­ties around in the world for re­cov­ery and prepa­ra­tion,” Sol­sk­jaer added.</p>
    <p>“But not this time. We just have to make the most out of a dif­fi­cult sit­u­a­tion in con­di­tions that are really hot, hu­mid.</p>
    <p>“We’ve got six days to pre­pare. It’s not of­ten that we have six days to get ready for a game.”</p>
    <p>On the spec­u­la­tion sur­round­ing Jadon San­cho af­ter his club Borus­sia Dort­mund claimed he would be stay­ing till the end of his con­tract in 2023, with United re­port­edly miss­ing a dead­line on Mon­day to agree terms, Sol­sk­jaer re­mained tightlippe­d.</p>
    <p>“I can’t com­ment on other teams’ players,” he said. “I can’t do that. You know that. I never do.”</p>
    <p>In the other quar­ter-fi­nal of the day, for­mer United striker Romelu Lukaku grabbed the de­ci­sive goal for In­ter Mi­lan as they beat Bayer Lev­erkusen 2-1.</p>
    <p>Ni­colo Barella opened the scor­ing for the Ital­ian Serie A side, while Kai Havertz pulled one back for the Ger­mans. In­ter will take on the win­ners of the last-eight clash be­tween Basel and Shakhtar Donetsk.</p>
    <p>THE MISS­ING IN­GRE­DI­ENT</p>
    <p>We have worked hard through­out the season, and come quite a dis­tance from where we were in terms of fit­ness, but men­tally, that is where they (the semi-fi­nals) are de­cided.</p>
