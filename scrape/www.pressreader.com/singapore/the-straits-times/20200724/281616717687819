    <p>WASH­ING­TON • Ten­sions be­tween China and the United States have reached the most acute lev­els since the coun­tries nor­malised diplo­matic re­la­tions more than four decades ago, with the US gov­ern­ment’s or­der that China close its Hous­ton con­sulate be­ing just the lat­est ex­am­ple.</p>
    <p>In de­fence, trade, tech­nol­ogy, hu­man rights and other cat­e­gories, ac­tions and reprisals by one side or the other have es­ca­lated sharply un­der Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump’s ad­min­is­tra­tion, de­spite his re­peated ex­pres­sions of ad­mi­ra­tion for Chi­nese Pres­i­dent Xi Jin­ping.</p>
    <p>Here is a look at what has hap­pened in the past few years to ex­ac­er­bate the ten­sions:</p>
    <p>THE CORO­N­AVIRUS AND ANTI-CHI­NESE RACISM</p>
    <p>Mr Trump and his sub­or­di­nates have blamed China for spread­ing the coro­n­avirus, which was first de­tected in the Chi­nese city of Wuhan late last year. They have re­peat­edly de­scribed the virus in racist and stig­ma­tis­ing terms, call­ing it the Wuhan virus, China virus and Kung Flu.</p>
    <p>The ad­min­is­tra­tion also has de­funded and or­dered a sev­er­ing of ties with the World Health Or­gan­i­sa­tion, ac­cus­ing it of hav­ing abet­ted short­com­ings in China’s ini­tial re­sponse to the out­break.</p>
    <p>On Tues­day, the Jus­tice Depart­ment ac­cused Chi­nese hack­ers of at­tempt­ing to steal in­for­ma­tion about Amer­i­can re­search on a virus vac­cine.</p>
    <p>For its part, China has re­jected the ad­min­is­tra­tion’s at­tacks over the virus and has crit­i­cised the poor US gov­ern­ment re­sponse to the out­break. Chi­nese pro­pa­gan­dists also have pro­moted the counter-the­ory, with no ev­i­dence, that US sol­diers may have been the orig­i­nal source of the virus dur­ing a visit to Wuhan last Oc­to­ber.</p>
    <p>A SE­VERE TEST OF TRADE TIES</p>
    <p>Mr Trump won of­fice in 2016 partly on his ac­cu­sa­tions that China was ex­ploit­ing the coun­try’s trade re­la­tion­ship with the US by sell­ing the coun­try far more than it pur­chased. In of­fice, he de­creed a se­ries of puni­tive tar­iffs on Chi­nese goods, and China re­tal­i­ated, in a trade war that has now lasted more than two years.</p>
    <p>While a truce was ef­fec­tively de­clared in Jan­uary with the sign­ing of what the ad­min­is­tra­tion called a phase one trade deal, most tar­iffs were not eased.</p>
    <p>SHOW­DOWN IN THE SOUTH CHINA SEA</p>
    <p>The Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion has in­creas­ingly chal­lenged China’s as­ser­tions of sovereignt­y and con­trol over much of the South China Sea, in­clud­ing vi­tal mar­itime ship­ping lanes. Just last week, Sec­re­tary of State Mike Pom­peo, who has de­scribed China as a ma­jor se­cu­rity threat, de­creed that most of Bei­jing’s claims in the South China Sea are “com­pletely un­law­ful”, set­ting up po­ten­tial mil­i­tary con­fronta­tions be­tween Chi­nese and US naval forces in the Pa­cific.</p>
    <p>A WIDENING BATTLE OVER TECH­NOL­OGY</p>
    <p>China has long been ac­cused by suc­ces­sive US ad­min­is­tra­tions of steal­ing Amer­i­can tech­nol­ogy. The Trump White House has es­ca­lated the ac­cu­sa­tions by seek­ing an in­ter­na­tional black­list­ing of Huawei, China’s largest tech­nol­ogy com­pany, call­ing it a front for China’s ef­forts to in­fil­trate the telecom­mu­ni­ca­tions in­fra­struc­ture of other na­tions for strate­gic ad­van­tage.</p>
    <p>The com­pany’s chief fi­nan­cial of­fi­cer, Meng Wanzhou, has been de­tained in Canada since De­cem­ber 2018 on an ex­tra­di­tion war­rant to the US on fraud charges. Last week, Bri­tain de­clared it was sid­ing with the US in bar­ring Huawei prod­ucts from its high-speed wire­less net­work.</p>
    <p>EXPULSIONS OF JOURNALIST­S AND OTHER ME­DIA WORK­ERS</p>
    <p>Ac­cus­ing China’s state-run me­dia out­lets of fo­ment­ing pro­pa­ganda, the Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion sharply lim­ited the num­ber of Chi­nese cit­i­zens who could work for Chi­nese news or­gan­i­sa­tions in the US. China re­tal­i­ated by or­der­ing the expulsions of journalist­s from The New York Times, The Wash­ing­ton Post and The Wall Street Jour­nal, and took other steps that sug­gested fur­ther im­ped­i­ments to Amer­i­can press ac­cess in China were loom­ing.</p>
    <p>In de­fence, trade, tech­nol­ogy, hu­man rights and other cat­e­gories, ac­tions and reprisals by one side or the other have es­ca­lated sharply un­der Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump’s ad­min­is­tra­tion, de­spite his re­peated ex­pres­sions of ad­mi­ra­tion for Chi­nese Pres­i­dent Xi Jin­ping.</p>
