    <p>In two decades of pro­fes­sional foot­ball, Daniel Ben­nett has suf­fered the pain of a lengthy knee in­jury and the agony of a Cup fi­nal de­feat.</p>
    <p>But th­ese can­not com­pare with the an­guish of be­ing sep­a­rated from his fam­ily for the past seven months due to the travel re­stric­tions in place to curb the spread of Covid-19.</p>
    <p>The 42-year-old Tampines Rovers de­fender re­lo­cated his fam­ily to Jo­hor Baru in 2013 and, while they had planned to move back to Sin­ga­pore at the end of this year, he has not been able to re­turn to his Malaysian home since March.</p>
    <p>He first stayed with his elder brother and then his friends, be­fore mov­ing back to his own apart­ment af­ter the ten­ants moved out two months ago.</p>
    <p>Ben­nett, Sin­ga­pore’s most capped player (142), told The Straits Times on Thurs­day: “There are many oth­ers who have been through worse, but this has been a very hard pe­riod for me per­son­ally.</p>
    <p>“I thought we would be apart for just weeks, and then it be­came months. I also lost my dog.</p>
    <p>“She passed away while I was gone, and it’s tough for me to talk about it even now.”</p>
    <p>How­ever, he is thank­ful for mo­bile ap­pli­ca­tions like FaceTime, which he uses ev­ery day to com­mu­ni­cate with his wife, 13-year-old daugh­ter and nine-year-old son.</p>
    <p>Ben­nett added: “I can’t take my kids places, so I play on­line games with them be­cause that is what they like, and then I talk to them at the same time.”</p>
    <p>But things are look­ing up for the vet­eran – his fam­ily will move to Sin­ga­pore next month.</p>
    <p>And af­ter a near seven-month sus­pen­sion due to the coro­n­avirus pan­demic, the Sin­ga­pore Pre­mier League is re­sum­ing to­day as the league-lead­ing Stags host fifth­placed Hougang United at Our Tampines Hub.</p>
    <p>He said: “Foot­ball does help take my mind off miss­ing my fam­ily. I told (Tampines coach) Gavin (Lee) I would train all day if I could, but we train only a cou­ple of hours each day.</p>
    <p>“The club can’t bring my fam­ily, but they have been very sup­port­ive. It’s good to start train­ing again and see the boys again.</p>
    <p>“We have a good team and of course, I want to win games, and I want to win the league. We trained a lot and we are ready to play.”</p>
    <p>Lee shared that club of­fi­cials have been check­ing in on play­ers dur­ing the ex­tended break and backed Ben­nett to play a key role in keep­ing more clean sheets as their ti­tle tilt re­sumes.</p>
    <p>Tampines recorded seven shutouts in 24 games last sea­son as they fin­ished sec­ond be­hind Brunei DPMM, and have al­ready man­aged three in four matches be­fore the hia­tus.</p>
    <p>Lee said: “Daniel has con­ducted him­self pro­fes­sion­ally through­out this dif­fi­cult pe­riod. He ap­pre­ci­ates foot­ball is a kind of es­cape and the club is like a sec­ond fam­ily.</p>
    <p>“On the pitch, he is com­posed on the ball and or­gan­ises the de­fence well. “Re­gard­less of his age, he would im­prove the de­fence of any team he plays for in this league.</p>
    <p>“Hougang have the abil­ity to hit teams on the break, so the way we con­trol pos­ses­sion will be im­por­tant in re­duc­ing the op­por­tu­ni­ties they have with the ball.”</p>
    <p>Hougang have lost main striker Stipe Plaz­i­bat – scorer of five goals in their open­ing three league games – to the Lion City Sailors, but Lee in­sists the Cheetahs still have plenty of ex­pe­ri­ence and fire­power in Shawal Anuar, Sahil Suhaimi and Shah­fiq Ghani.</p>
    <p>He is also not putting much stock in Tampines’ record of nine wins and one draw from their last 10 en­coun­ters with Hougang.</p>
    <p>Hougang coach Clement Teo knows his team have to end the poor run against Tampines if they are to im­prove on last sea­son’s third-placed fin­ish.</p>
    <p>He said: “We must see this as mo­ti­va­tion for us to start a new chap­ter.</p>
    <p>“We came close when we threw away two-goal leads to draw 3-3, and we know we have at­tack­ing op­tions to hurt them.</p>
    <p>“We know they are a pos­ses­sion­based team, but we be­lieve we are also ca­pa­ble of mixing things up.</p>
    <p>“We also know the threat they pos­sess with Boris Ko­pi­tovic, Jor­dan Webb and Kyoga Naka­mura, and we have worked on our de­fence as a group and in in­di­vid­ual sce­nar­ios.</p>
    <p>“If we can ex­e­cute our game plan in the proper man­ner and, with the cor­rect tim­ing, we should be able to get a re­sult.”</p>
