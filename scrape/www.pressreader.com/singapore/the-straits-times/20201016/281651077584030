    <p>Ef­forts to boost eco­nomic re­cov­ery and cre­ate jobs need to in­ten­sify, now that the Covid-19 sit­u­a­tion has sta­bilised, said Deputy Prime Min­is­ter and Fi­nance Min­is­ter Heng Swee Keat.</p>
    <p>The move re­quires the Gov­ern­ment to shift from broad-based re­lief mea­sures to more tar­geted sup­port so firms and work­ers can stave off the worst ef­fects of the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>This will in­clude new mea­sures to help the ail­ing nightlife sec­tor, Mr Heng said. The Gov­ern­ment is fi­nal­is­ing a set of mea­sures to sup­port nightlife busi­nesses, which it will an­nounce next week, he added.</p>
    <p>It will also study how best to sup­port self-em­ployed work­ers, and con­sider ex­tend­ing the Jobs Growth In­cen­tive (JGI) scheme – a tiered wage sub­sidy ini­tia­tive that sup­ports em­ploy­ers in their ef­forts to hire more Sin­ga­pore­ans and per­ma­nent res­i­dents.</p>
    <p>Wrapping up the de­bate in Par­lia­ment yes­ter­day on how Sin­ga­pore can emerge stronger after Covid-19, Mr Heng said: “As the Covid-19 sit­u­a­tion in Sin­ga­pore sta­bilises, the next press­ing task is to help our econ­omy re­cover. Our sup­port must there­fore evolve from ‘re­sus­ci­tate’ to ‘re­ju­ve­nate’. To do so, we must shift from a fo­cus on job re­ten­tion to a greater em­pha­sis on cre­at­ing jobs.”</p>
    <p>Covid-19 is both a health and eco­nomic cri­sis, and the Gov­ern­ment’s pri­or­ity ini­tially was to chan­nel sup­port to af­fected peo­ple and busi­nesses as quickly as pos­si­ble. This sup­port in­cluded the Jobs Sup­port Scheme (JSS), where the Gov­ern­ment co-pays salaries of lo­cal work­ers to help em­ploy­ers re­tain them.</p>
    <p>But these mea­sures had to be re­freshed and new ones in­tro­duced to deal with the chang­ing coro­n­avirus sit­u­a­tion. That is why the JGI was cre­ated, said Mr Heng, and JSS was ex­tended and en­hanced.</p>
    <p>The JSS, which was first in­tro­duced as part of Bud­get mea­sures in Fe­bru­ary, sub­sidised be­tween 25 per cent and 75 per cent of wages paid for 10 months. After some tweaks, it now cov­ers wages paid up to next March for firms in sec­tors hit hard­est by the Covid-19 cri­sis, and up to De­cem­ber this year for sec­tors that are man­ag­ing well.</p>
    <p>Mr Heng said busi­nesses here fall into dif­fer­ent cat­e­gories, and gov­ern­ment as­sis­tance will be tai­lored to fit their needs.</p>
    <p>First, firms ex­pe­ri­enc­ing a greater de­mand in busi­ness in the post-Covid-19 econ­omy will be en­cour­aged to make full use of ca­pa­bil­ity grants to ex­pand, and hire more lo­cal work­ers un­der the JGI scheme.</p>
    <p>In the sec­ond cat­e­gory are firms suf­fer­ing from a tem­po­rary drop in de­mand but are likely to even­tu­ally re­cover – for in­stance, in in­dus­tries like tourism, avi­a­tion, the arts and sports, where help has been made avail­able.</p>
    <p>There are also firms in this cat­e­gory that will sig­nif­i­cantly im­pact Sin­ga­pore’s com­pet­i­tive­ness or na­tional se­cu­rity if they fail – so ad­di­tional sup­port might need to be given to them, Mr Heng said.</p>
    <p>“In such in­stances, we can­not pre­clude the pos­si­bil­ity of the Gov­ern­ment tak­ing some ac­tion to en­sure these strate­gic ca­pa­bil­i­ties are pre­served. The ex­act form of sup­port will de­pend on the cir­cum­stances, but the bar for any gov­ern­ment ac­tion will be high.”</p>
    <p>He added that any aid given will be pru­dent and the Gov­ern­ment will en­sure pub­lic funds are well used.</p>
    <p>In the third cat­e­gory are firms like those in the nightlife sec­tor, whose out­look re­mains bleak due to fun­da­men­tal changes in their op­er­at­ing en­vi­ron­ments, and which need help to rein­vent them­selves.</p>
    <p>Work­ers, too, fall in dif­fer­ent cat­e­gories, and sup­port from the Gov­ern­ment will seek to take into ac­count their spe­cific needs.</p>
    <p>For in­stance, mid-ca­reer pro­fes­sion­als will get more help, espe­cially those who have been re­trenched and need to reskill to find new em­ploy­ment.</p>
    <p>Former of­fend­ers could also fall into this group, and Mr Heng said the Man­power Min­istry will an­nounce more de­tails of how the JGI scheme can be ex­tended to in­clude them.</p>
    <p>Self-em­ployed work­ers will also not be left out. The Gov­ern­ment has al­ready in­tro­duced the Self-Em­ployed Per­son In­come Re­lief Scheme to give re­lief to those with fewer means and less fam­ily sup­port. It will study how more can be done to sup­port this group of work­ers, Mr Heng said.</p>
    <p>In the case of low-wage work­ers, many of them work on the front line and have been dis­pro­por­tion­ately af­fected by the pan­demic and safe man­age­ment mea­sures. To help them, Mr Heng said the pro­gres­sive wage model will be ex­panded to more sec­tors over time, while mak­ing sure busi­nesses can cope.</p>
    <p>“We will con­tinue to mon­i­tor the sit­u­a­tion closely and pro­vide ad­di­tional sup­port where nec­es­sary,” he said.</p>
    <p>As the Covid-19 sit­u­a­tion in Sin­ga­pore sta­bilises, the next press­ing task is to help our econ­omy re­cover. Our sup­port must there­fore evolve from ‘re­sus­ci­tate’ to ‘re­ju­ve­nate’. To do so, we must shift from a fo­cus on job re­ten­tion to a greater em­pha­sis on cre­at­ing jobs.</p>
