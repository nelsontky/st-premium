    <p>NEW DELHI • In­dia will be given first pri­or­ity for the de­liv­ery of the As­traZeneca/Ox­ford vac­cine af­ter its Bri­tish de­vel­op­ers claimed suc­cess, the world’s largest vac­cine man­u­fac­turer by vol­ume has said, though New Delhi said it has not de­cided which vac­cine to adopt.</p>
    <p>The chief ex­ec­u­tive of the Serum In­sti­tute of In­dia, Mr Adar Poon­awalla, said the man­u­fac­turer has al­ready pro­duced 40 mil­lion doses of the vac­cine so far.</p>
    <p>“By Jan­uary, we should have... 100 mil­lion doses is min­i­mum, be­cause we’ve al­ready made 40 mil­lion doses,” he told tele­vi­sion broad­caster NDTV on Mon­day.</p>
    <p>Mr Poon­awalla, whose fa­ther founded the vac­cine man­u­fac­turer, said he ex­pected that some 90 per cent of Serum In­sti­tute’s doses were to be sold to the In­dian gov­ern­ment at around 250 ru­pees (S$4.60) each.</p>
    <p>“Most of that, 90 per cent, is what’s go­ing to go to the gov­ern­ment of In­dia and maybe 10 per cent in the pri­vate mar­ket at the higher price (of 1,000 ru­pees).</p>
    <p>“We’re hop­ing for this emer­gency use li­cence so that by the end of De­cem­ber, Jan­uary, we can start rolling out some (doses).”</p>
    <p>As­traZeneca and Ox­ford Univer­sity said on Mon­day that their drug had proved, on av­er­age, to be 70 per cent ef­fec­tive at stop­ping the coro­n­avirus af­ter test­ing it on 23,000 peo­ple.</p>
    <p>The Ox­ford drug can be trans­ported eas­ily at nor­mal re­frig­er­a­tor tem­per­a­tures, un­like some of the other can­di­dates which re­quire ex­tremely cold stor­age.</p>
    <p>As­traZeneca said it planned to pro­duce up to three bil­lion doses of the vac­cine next year if it passes the re­main­ing reg­u­la­tory hur­dles.</p>
    <p>Prime Min­is­ter Naren­dra Modi warned yes­ter­day any Covid-19 vac­cine could lead to side-ef­fects in some peo­ple, as even pop­u­lar medicines do, and that the gov­ern­ment would only go by sci­ence in fi­nal­is­ing one for the coun­try.</p>
    <p>Mr Modi said it was not yet known which vac­cine would be launched in In­dia and at what price, but urged states to work with the fed­eral gov­ern­ment to keep dis­tri­bu­tion in­fra­struc­ture such as cold stor­ages ready.</p>
    <p>The Serum In­sti­tute in Au­gust struck a deal with Gavi, the Vac­cine Al­liance, to pro­duce up to 100 mil­lion Covid-19 doses of two dif­fer­ent po­ten­tial vac­cines from As­traZeneca and US biotech com­pany No­vavax. Once the vac­cines gain reg­u­la­tory ap­proval, the doses could be pro­duced as early as the first half of next year for dis­tri­bu­tion to low- and mid­dle-in­come coun­tries, Gavi said.</p>
    <p>In­dia’s Health Min­is­ter Harsh Vard­han had told In­dia Today TV ear­lier on Mon­day that he ex­pected be­tween 250 mil­lion and 300 mil­lion In­di­ans would be im­mu­nised by Septem­ber next year.</p>
