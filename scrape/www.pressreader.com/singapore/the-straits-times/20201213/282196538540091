    <p>Ig­nor­ing e-mails about the ben­e­fits of min­i­mal­ism that show up in my mail­box, I have been on a shop­ping spree lately.</p>
    <p>Af­ter months of stay­ing in­doors, un­der­tak­ing util­i­tar­ian trips – to Ikea to buy long over­due ready-to-hang cur­tains, or to Skech­ers to re­place worn-out walk­ing shoes – turned out to be sur­pris­ingly sat­is­fy­ing.</p>
    <p>One evening, af­ter a long day at work (at home, of course), I dis­cov­ered the se­cret to ef­fi­cient shop­ping. Week­nights are the best time to visit your neigh­bour­hood mall, even bet­ter if it’s an out­let mall. No queues out­side the fit­ting room. No crowds at the cashier. I re­turned home with bags of things that I didn’t re­ally need but were nice to have.</p>
    <p>A few days later, I spent a few happy hours brows­ing through the stacks at Books Ki­noku­niya, fol­lowed by a leisurely stroll on Or­chard Road ad­mir­ing ex­pen­sive jew­ellery and watches in well-lit dis­play cases. I didn’t buy much in the end but en­joyed the hum of shop­pers walk­ing busily past me, their faces hid­den be­hind masks, their eyes fo­cused on the next des­ti­na­tion.</p>
    <p>Did I en­joy these out­ings be­cause they gave me an ex­cuse to spend time in sur­round­ings that looked noth­ing like my home of­fice? Seemed like a pos­si­ble ex­pla­na­tion but it could not fully ac­count for the un­usual be­hav­iour I had be­gun to ex­press on­line.</p>
    <p>In the last cou­ple of years, I had slowly moved from or­der­ing books from one on­line plat­form to em­brac­ing the con­ve­nience of on­line gro­cery shop­ping.</p>
    <p>But now I found my­self click­ing through web­sites to or­der hard-to-find gifts for peo­ple (my­self in­cluded), book­ing a stay­ca­tion, and sign­ing up for on­line classes. I could do all this with­out hav­ing to step out of my home or in­ter­act with other hu­mans.</p>
    <p>This has been a year of adapt­ing and chang­ing with the times. A few months ago, we had a muted cel­e­bra­tion to mark my el­der daugh­ter’s col­lege grad­u­a­tion, a far cry from what I had been plan­ning for this mile­stone. In the next few weeks, we are plan­ning to go on a cruise to nowhere, a friv­o­lous hol­i­day to mark a year of no travel. There are years that call for aus­ter­ity and years that call for in­dul­gence. The year 2020 has de­manded both.</p>
    <p>Clearly, the so­cial as­pect of shop­ping could not be blamed for my sud­den atyp­i­cal spend­ing.</p>
    <p>To be per­fectly hon­est, the shop­ping had given me plea­sure. But it also made me pause. Had I be­come a re­tail ther­apy ad­dict? How? And why now?</p>
    <p>MANTRA OF MOD­ER­A­TION</p>
    <p>Grow­ing up in a fam­ily with mod­est means had re­sulted in a life­time of sec­ond-guess­ing my­self when it came to spend­ing. As a child, I had seen my par­ents plan and save and dis­cuss ev­ery ex­pense, from ap­pli­ance pur­chases to their chil­dren’s col­lege ed­u­ca­tion.</p>
    <p>Their fru­gal ap­proach was not just an ex­pres­sion of their lim­ited in­come but also of their phi­los­o­phy to­wards life. Mod­er­a­tion was their mantra. The clear line be­tween wants and needs trans­lated to a</p>
    <p>life­style that en­sured that noth­ing was to be ac­quired for out­ward ap­pear­ances alone.</p>
    <p>When I be­gan to earn a liv­ing, de­spite hav­ing more dis­pos­able in­come and fewer con­straints than my par­ents, I was ex­tremely cau­tious when in­dulging my wants, ir­re­spec­tive of whether the ob­ject of my de­sire was an ex­pen­sive phone or a pre­mium hair­cut.</p>
    <p>The lim­its on my spend­ing were not dic­tated by my bank bal­ance, but by the val­ues in­grained in my for­ma­tive years. It took years of prac­tice to wean my­self from my par­ents’ be­liefs and give my­self per­mis­sion to spend on a whim. I still held on to one key les­son – never to spend more than what I earned.</p>
    <p>When I saw my credit card bill last month, I was sur­prised by my new spend­thrift avatar. I hadn’t ex­ceeded my bud­get, but the</p>
    <p>un­usual trend made me cu­ri­ous.</p>
    <p>Change can be fast or slow. Change can be trig­gered by in­trin­sic or ex­trin­sic fac­tors.</p>
    <p>When I look back at my spend­ing habits over the decades, I no­tice the grad­ual up­ward tick that came with more in­come, but also more re­spon­si­bil­ity, to­wards self and fam­ily. I didn’t hes­i­tate to buy or­ganic baby food and branded toys, or smart clothes for work. We went out for oc­ca­sional din­ners and an­nual fam­ily hol­i­days but also saved for the chil­dren’s higher ed­u­ca­tion and for rainy days.</p>
    <p>Up ahead, I can see the ap­proach­ing plateau, as my chil­dren set sail to­wards their own des­ti­na­tions, and my days of pay­ing for col­lege tu­ition and Spo­tify sub­scrip­tions come to an end.</p>
    <p>What I had not fac­tored in the now, how­ever, was the im­pact</p>
