    <p>How does one place a price on the badge of a car?</p>
    <p>It is pretty straight­for­ward when it comes to a car’s tech­ni­cal spec­i­fi­ca­tions and per­for­mance, which are ob­jec­tive num­bers. It is also pos­si­ble to nail down traits such as ride qual­ity and steer­ing pre­ci­sion.</p>
    <p>But badge ap­peal is in­tan­gi­ble. The Cupra Ateca is the lat­est ex­am­ple of this dilemma.</p>
    <p>Cupra is the mo­tor­sport arm of Span­ish car­maker Seat, which is part of the Volk­swa­gen fam­ily.</p>
    <p>Hence, the Cupra Ateca is a VW in some ways. Un­der its hood lurks a 2-litre tur­bocharged en­gine that also pow­ers hot hatches like the VW Golf GTI and Golf R.</p>
    <p>Like the Golf R, the Cupra Ateca’s power plant is paired with a sev­en­speed dual-clutch gear­box and power is de­liv­ered to all four wheels. This makes it the cross­over equiv­a­lent of the Golf R hot hatch.</p>
    <p>And yet for their me­chan­i­cal sim­i­lar­i­ties, the Golf R costs more, de­spite the Cupra Ateca be­ing in the more pop­u­lar cross­over form.</p>
    <p>The dif­fer­ence, I sur­mise, must be the badge ap­peal. The VW badge costs a cool $28,000 on the Golf R.</p>
    <p>But if you are will­ing to forgo that badge and get a Cupra Ateca, an ex­hil­a­rat­ing ride awaits.</p>
    <p>The car is based on the Ateca, a func­tional and prac­ti­cal fam­ily cross­over about the size of the Mazda CX-30. Cupra has turned it into a speed ma­chine.</p>
    <p>The car re­viewed here gets an ex­ter­nal makeover with a re­designed front bumper – com­plete with a new hon­ey­comb grille, alu­minium dif­fuser and full LED lights. The rear bumper gets LED lights and dy­namic turn sig­nals.</p>
    <p>In the cabin, the cen­tre con­sole is now a 9.2-inch touch­screen dis­play that sup­ports wire­less An­droid Auto and Ap­ple Car Play, re­plac­ing a smaller 8-inch unit.</p>
    <p>A 10.25-inch vir­tual in­stru­ment dis­play is car­ried over from the pre­de­ces­sor, but the steer­ing wheel gets a new de­sign. Sports seats are now stan­dard is­sue.</p>
    <p>The car gets a slew of pre­mium ameni­ties, in­clud­ing adap­tive dampers, a 360-de­gree cam­era and adap­tive cruise con­trol.</p>
    <p>The Cupra Ateca sprints from zero to 100kmh in 4.9 sec­onds, down from its pre­de­ces­sor’s 5.2 sec­onds. It is faster than the Honda Civic Type R (5.7 sec­onds) and Golf GTI (6.4 sec­onds), but frac­tion­ally slower than the Golf R (4.6 sec­onds).</p>
    <p>A fea­ture which I can­not get enough of is the launch con­trol. It is sim­i­lar to the sys­tem in the Golf R – it can be ac­ti­vated only when the car is in the Cupra race mode with trac­tion con­trol switched off.</p>
    <p>Here, the driver plants the left foot on the brake and the right foot on the throt­tle, and the car cat­a­pults for­ward with a mildly vi­o­lent shove when the brake is re­leased.</p>
    <p>In the Cupra mode, the firmer damp­ing as well as pops and crack­les from the throaty ex­haust are a lit­tle over the top for daily drives. But in com­fort mode, with the soft­est damp­ing, the car be­haves like a reg­u­lar fam­ily ride.</p>
    <p>In this sense, the Cupra’s en­gi­neers get a 10 out of 10 for putting to­gether what is ef­fec­tively a car with a twin per­son­al­ity.</p>
    <p>Fuel con­sump­tion is less im­pres­sive, though. Over a two-day 132km test-drive, it av­er­ages 11.5 litres/ 100km, ver­sus the of­fi­cial fig­ure of 8 litres/100km.</p>
    <p>The Cupra Ateca faces no direct ri­val in the com­pact per­for­mance cross­over seg­ment right now.</p>
    <p>The Audi Q2, a smaller car, has a per­for­mance SQ2 ver­sion that does not have an ar­rival date in Sin­ga­pore yet. And even if it does, it is likely to be costlier than the Cupra Ateca.</p>
    <p>The Cupra even leaves the Porsche Ma­can (6.7 sec­onds) and Ma­can S (5.3 sec­onds) trail­ing in the cen­tury sprint, and th­ese cars cost at least $100,000 more.</p>
    <p>This makes the Cupra Ateca the king of com­pact crossovers, which­ever badge it wears.</p>
