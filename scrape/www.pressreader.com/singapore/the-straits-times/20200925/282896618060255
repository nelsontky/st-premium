    <p>LOS AN­GE­LES • Walt Dis­ney has post­poned the re­lease of Black Wi­dow, the highly an­tic­i­pated Marvel movie star­ring Scar­lett Jo­hans­son, for an­other six months, in the latest set­back for film stu­dios and theatres.</p>
    <p>The movie, orig­i­nally sched­uled to hit theatres in the United States on May 1, had al­ready been de­layed un­til Nov 6. It is now set to de­but on May 7 next year, Dis­ney said on Wed­nes­day.</p>
    <p>West Side Story, direc­tor Steven Spiel­berg’s take on the clas­sic Broad­way mu­si­cal, was also pushed back an en­tire year, to Dec 10 next year.</p>
    <p>Though most theatres in the US are open, stu­dios still face a daunt­ing path to prof­itabil­ity for their high-pro­file pic­tures.</p>
    <p>Be­cause of the coronaviru­s pan­demic, the largest movie mar­kets in the coun­try, Los An­ge­les and New York City, are still closed. Sales at open venues have been capped to meet so­cial dis­tanc­ing re­quire­ments. A theatre trade group also said last week that many con­sumers still think their lo­cal cin­ema is closed.</p>
    <p>The de­lay pro­longs the pain for theatre chains, which need ma­jor pic­tures to draw fans back. Just one big-bud­get film has opened in re­cent months: Warner Bros’ Tenet.</p>
    <p>The US$200 mil­lion (S$275 mil­lion) film has gen­er­ated a lit­tle more than US$36 mil­lion in do­mes­tic ticket sales in four weeks of re­lease, in­di­cat­ing that the public is re­luc­tant to go out and mark­ing one of the weak­est show­ings for direc­tor Christo­pher Nolan. His last movie, Dunkirk, sold al­most US$200 mil­lion in tick­ets do­mes­ti­cally in 2017.</p>
    <p>Against that back­drop, the reschedul­ing of Black Wi­dow was widely an­tic­i­pated in Hol­ly­wood.</p>
    <p>Dis­ney’s move means there will be no new ma­jor Hol­ly­wood films in cin­e­mas un­til Nov 20, when Metro-Gold­wyn-Mayer’s James Bond movie No Time To Die is sched­uled to de­but.</p>
    <p>AT&T-owned Warner Bros still plans to re­lease two ma­jor films in De­cem­ber: sci-fi story Dune and DC Comics’ Won­der Woman 1984, though it is pos­si­ble those dates could slip be­cause of the virus.</p>
    <p>Dis­ney also an­nounced reschedul­ing plans for other movies, in­clud­ing mov­ing Agatha Christie mys­tery Death On The Nile to Dec 18 this year from Oct 23, and Marvel’s Shang-Chi And The Leg­end Of The Ten Rings to July 9 next year from May 7.</p>
    <p>It still plans to re­lease Soul, the latest an­i­mated film from Pixar, on Nov 20 as sched­uled. That could al­low the com­pany to re­lease the movie early next year on Dis­ney+.</p>
    <p>The stu­dio also kept No­mad­land on the cal­en­dar for Dec 4. The drama, which stars Frances McDor­mand, has cap­tured fes­ti­val prizes and is a top Os­car con­tender.</p>
