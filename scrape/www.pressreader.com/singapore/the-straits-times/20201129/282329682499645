    <p>Cal­i­for­nian start-up Eat Just ear­lier this month an­nounced a US$120 mil­lion (S$160 mil­lion) fa­cil­ity in Sin­ga­pore to pro­duce its plant-based eggs. But an­other faux egg prod­uct is scram­bling hot on its heels.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore-based food tech startup Float Foods will launch its plant-based whole egg sub­sti­tute in the first quar­ter of 2022.</p>
    <p>Called On­lyEg, it is made with legumes. The liq­uid egg white and spher­i­cal yolk come as sep­a­rate com­po­nents. It works best as a sunny side up, com­plete with runny yolk.</p>
    <p>Eat Just’s Just Egg prod­uct – made with mung beans – comes as a liq­uid scram­ble and folded egg pat­ties.</p>
    <p>Prior to the launch of On­lyEg, Float Foods will roll out its plant­based egg patty and shred­ded egg</p>
    <p>– good for stir-fries and fried rice – next year.</p>
    <p>Float Foods’ chief ex­ec­u­tive and founder Vinita Choolani is work­ing with the Agency for Sci­ence, Tech­nol­ogy and Re­search (A*Star) on in­creas­ing the pro­tein level of On­lyEg to en­sure a higher nu­tri­tional value. In ad­di­tion, it will have no choles­terol and be hor­mone- and an­tibi­otic-free.</p>
    <p>Ms Choolani says: “We want our plant-based prod­ucts to be un­der­pinned by a ‘food as medicine’ ap­proach. There’s no rea­son why later on – after the first range of prod­ucts – we can’t do a ver­sion for di­a­bet­ics or those with heart prob­lems.”</p>
    <p>The idea for cre­at­ing a plant­based egg was hatched from Ms Choolani’s trau­matic ex­pe­ri­ence with eggs as a 15-year-old.</p>
    <p>For one year, she and her four broth­ers had to take a shot of raw egg with brandy be­fore go­ing to school, as their mother be­lieved the “scrawny” sib­lings re­quired a pro­tein boost.</p>
    <p>“I can­not deal with wet and runny eggs. I have not had an egg for the last 40 years and I fi­nally didn’t feel sick cut­ting into this plant-based one,” says Ms Choolani, who has a biotech back­ground.</p>
    <p>She spent the last decade cat­a­pult­ing biotech start-up Inex In­no­vate into a lead­ing women’s in­no­va­tion health­care com­pany val­ued at US$72 mil­lion last year.</p>
    <p>Be­sides plant-based eggs, Ms Choolani has good proof-of­con­cept for plant-based yo­gurt from ve­gan cul­ture and pro­to­types for ve­gan cheese and plant-based milk.</p>
    <p>Ac­knowl­edg­ing that plant-based prod­ucts gen­er­ally have a pre­mium price tag, she as­sures that prices for her prod­ucts will be “ac­ces­si­ble and af­ford­able”.</p>
    <p>Float Foods is part of the surge in lo­cal plant-based com­pa­nies mak­ing waves in the scene.</p>
    <p>Last Tues­day, Shiok Meats – which cul­ti­vates crus­tacean meat from stem cells – an­nounced that it had signed a mem­o­ran­dum of un­der­stand­ing with Sin­ga­pore Polytech­nic to jointly ad­vance food in­no­va­tion in the al­ter­na­tive pro­tein sec­tor, par­tic­u­larly for cell-based meat and seafood.</p>
    <p>It also launched its cell-based lob­ster meat in two dishes – Shiok lob­ster gaz­pa­cho and ter­rine of Shiok lob­ster – in a pri­vate tast­ing ses­sion for in­vited guests. Its Shiok Shrimp prod­uct is on track to launch in 2022.</p>
    <p>Plant-based com­pany Growth­well – a sig­nif­i­cant share­holder of Is­raeli start-up ChickP Pro­tein – plans to open a pro­duc­tion fa­cil­ity here in the sec­ond quar­ter of next year.</p>
    <p>It is in the fi­nal round of re­search­ing and de­vel­op­ing a chick­pea pro­tein-based seafood al­ter­na­tive col­lec­tion – ChickP Squid, ChickP Crab Patty and ChickP Shrimp.</p>
    <p>Last Thurs­day, ChickP an­nounced that it had patented its plant-based pro­tein so­lu­tion in Is­rael and is work­ing on do­ing the same here.</p>
    <p>Its 90 per cent chick­pea iso­late comes in a pow­der form, for food man­u­fac­tur­ers to use in recipes for added tex­ture in cre­at­ing plant­based meat prod­ucts.</p>
    <p>Other re­cently launched prod­ucts in Sin­ga­pore in­clude Hong Kong’s Om­niMeat Lun­cheon, a plant­based lun­cheon meat, and Swedish oat milk brand Oatly’s range of ve­gan ice cream us­ing its plant-based milk.</p>
