    <p>More vac­cines are ex­pected to ar­rive in Sin­ga­pore in the next few months, in­clud­ing those by Amer­i­can biotech­nol­ogy firm Moderna and China’s Si­no­vac, said Health Min­is­ter Gan Kim Yong yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The Repub­lic re­ceived its first ship­ment of the Pfizer-BioN­Tech Covid-19 vac­cine last month.</p>
    <p>Mr Gan said in Par­lia­ment that there will be enough Covid-19 vac­cines for ev­ery­one in Sin­ga­pore by the third quar­ter of this year if all goes ac­cord­ing to sched­ule.</p>
    <p>“The vac­cines will ar­rive in Sin­ga­pore in batches, given high global de­mand, es­pe­cially from coun­tries with high rates of in­fec­tion,” he said.</p>
    <p>Phar­ma­ceu­ti­cal com­pa­nies will also need time to scale up vac­cine pro­duc­tion and dis­tri­bu­tion, Mr Gan added in his min­is­te­rial state­ment on the Covid-19 sit­u­a­tion here.</p>
    <p>The Pfizer-BioN­Tech vac­cine is the first vac­cine against the coro­n­avirus that has been ap­proved for use in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>The na­tion’s vac­ci­na­tion drive is kick­ing off first with health­care work­ers and staff in the health­care sec­tor as they work in the di­rect care of pa­tients or in sup­port­ing roles, Mr Gan said.</p>
    <p>Other front-line and es­sen­tial per­son­nel will also be pri­ori­tised for re­ceiv­ing the Covid-19 vac­cine, he said.</p>
    <p>These in­clude swab­bers hired by the Health Pro­mo­tion Board, as well as staff work­ing in govern­ment quar­an­tine fa­cil­i­ties, com­mu­nity care fa­cil­i­ties, and ded­i­cated stay-home no­tice fa­cil­i­ties.</p>
    <p>For ex­am­ple, 40 staff from the Na­tional Cen­tre for In­fec­tious Dis­eases were the first to re­ceive doses of the Pfizer-BioN­Tech vac­cine on Dec 30 last year, in­clud­ing Pro­fes­sor Leo Yee Sin, the cen­tre’s ex­ec­u­tive direc­tor.</p>
    <p>Mr Gan added that the el­derly and those at greater risk of se­vere dis­ease from the coro­n­avirus will be vac­ci­nated from next month, be­gin­ning with se­niors aged 70 and above.</p>
    <p>Those in jobs or set­tings where the risk of a su­per-spread­ing event is high – such as the con­struc­tion, marine and process sec­tors – in­clud­ing mi­grant work­ers, will also be pri­ori­tised.</p>
    <p>“There­after, we will pro­gres­sively broaden our vac­ci­na­tions to in­clude other Sin­ga­pore­ans and long-term res­i­dents who are med­i­cally el­i­gi­ble,” the min­is­ter said.</p>
    <p>Mr Gan added that as more vac­cines are ap­proved for use, Sin­ga­pore will ad­just its vac­ci­na­tion pro­gramme depend­ing on vac­cine sup­ply and dis­ease epi­demi­ol­ogy.</p>
    <p>He told the House that the Govern­ment had started plan­ning for the Covid-19 vac­ci­na­tion pro­gramme “very early on”, and that it has in place end-to-end pro­cesses to meet the cold-chain lo­gis­tics re­quire­ments.</p>
    <p>These in­clude de­liv­ery and re­ceipt of the doses at the air­port, stor­age and trans­port to vac­ci­na­tion sites – so that the qual­ity and ef­fi­cacy of the vac­cines are not com­pro­mised.</p>
    <p>In re­sponse to Ms Foo Mee Har (West Coast GRC), who wanted to know how Sin­ga­pore was mit­i­gat­ing the risk of non-de­liv­ery of vac­cine or­ders, Mr Gan said Sin­ga­pore is in close con­tact with the man­u­fac­tur­ers that it has signed con­tracts with and that it is mon­i­tor­ing the de­liv­ery sched­ule.</p>
    <p>“We are also look­ing for­ward to more vac­cines be­ing ap­proved so we have al­ter­na­tives,” said Mr Gan.</p>
    <p>He said di­ver­si­fi­ca­tion of vac­cine sources will en­sure that Sin­ga­pore has ac­cess to other sup­plies, even if one ship­ment is de­layed.</p>
    <p>“This way, we en­sure that we have ad­e­quate vac­cine sup­plies for the whole of Sin­ga­pore,” he added.</p>
    <p>EN­SUR­ING AD­E­QUATE SUP­PLY</p>
    <p>We are also look­ing for­ward to more vac­cines be­ing ap­proved so we have al­ter­na­tives... This way, we en­sure that we have ad­e­quate vac­cine sup­plies for the whole of Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>HEALTH MIN­IS­TER GAN KIM YONG, not­ing that di­ver­si­fi­ca­tion of vac­cine sources will en­sure that Sin­ga­pore has ac­cess to other sup­plies, even if one ship­ment is de­layed.</p>
