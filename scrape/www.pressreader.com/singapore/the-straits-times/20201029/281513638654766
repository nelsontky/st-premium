    <p>Trav­ellers can now scan their face and irises at all check­points to ver­ify their iden­ti­ties, aside from us­ing their fin­ger­prints. Such fa­cial and iris scans take Sin­ga­pore a step closer to achiev­ing its pass­port-free im­mi­gra­tion goal, said the Im­mi­gra­tion and Check­points Author­ity (ICA), which aims to im­ple­ment a fully con­tact­less im­mi­gra­tion clearance process by 2022. It said the fa­cial and iris scans are more reli­able than the usual fin­ger­print method, as iris pat­terns are more var­ied and unique than fin­ger­prints.</p>
    <p>To use the fa­cial and iris scans, trav­ellers must have regis­tered their bio­met­rics with the ICA. Those who have not done so, or whose fa­cial and iris scans fail, can still check in by scan­ning their fin­ger­prints.</p>
    <p>Fa­cial and iris scans have re­placed fin­ger­print scans as the main mode of iden­ti­fy­ing trav­ellers at all im­mi­gra­tion check­points, bring­ing Sin­ga­pore one step closer to a pass­port-free fu­ture, the Im­mi­gra­tion and Check­points Author­ity (ICA) said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore­ans, per­ma­nent res­i­dents, long-term pass hold­ers and other trav­ellers who have regis­tered their iris and fa­cial bio­met­rics with the agency can use the new scans at all land, sea and air check­points.</p>
    <p>More than two mil­lion Sin­ga­pore­ans, or about 70 per cent of all el­i­gi­ble Sin­ga­pore­ans, have regis­tered their iris and fa­cial bio­met­rics with the agency, and 130,000 per­ma­nent res­i­dents have done so.</p>
    <p>Those who have not, or are un­suc­cess­ful when us­ing the iris and fa­cial scans at check­points, will still be able to check in by scan­ning their fin­ger­prints, said ICA, which rolled out the tech­nol­ogy to­gether with the Home Team Sci­ence and Tech­nol­ogy Agency (HTX).</p>
    <p>ICA said the tech­nol­ogy, which was tri­alled at Changi Air­port and Tuas Checkpoint last year, will pro­vide “even more reli­able au­then­ti­ca­tion of the iden­tity of trav­ellers”, and is less prone to mis­use as it re­quires spe­cialised equip­ment.</p>
    <p>Lead en­gi­neer Wong Weiyang of HTX’s Bio­met­rics and Pro­fil­ing Cen­tre of Ex­per­tise said iris pat­terns were cho­sen as a bio­met­ric iden­ti­fier as they are more var­ied and unique than fin­ger­prints.</p>
    <p>An iris scan pro­vides al­most 250 fea­ture points for match­ing, as com­pared with about 100 points for a fin­ger­print. The fa­cial scans act as a “sec­ond check” for a per­son’s iden­tity, said ICA.</p>
    <p>Trav­ellers who have is­sues ver­i­fy­ing their iden­ti­ties ow­ing to aged, scarred or dry fin­gers would be able to use the au­to­mated clearance lanes eas­ily with this tech­nol­ogy, said ICA.</p>
    <p>ICA’s deputy head of op­er­a­tions devel­op­ment, deputy su­per­in­ten­dent (DSP) Melvin Tiang, said the con­tact­less na­ture of these scans brings ma­jor ben­e­fits.</p>
    <p>“With con­tact­less tech­nol­ogy, it al­lows us to cap­ture the bio­met­rics with­out any phys­i­cal con­tact with the ma­chine, so (the process) is hy­gienic. This is es­pe­cially im­por­tant, given this cur­rent Covid-19 pan­demic sit­u­a­tion,” he said.</p>
    <p>MORE HY­GIENIC</p>
    <p>The sys­tem takes less than a sec­ond to match a trav­eller’s bio­met­rics with ICA’s data­base.</p>
    <p>For­eign vis­i­tors will need to reg­is­ter their bio­met­ric de­tails with the agency when they ar­rive in Sin­ga­pore for the first time.</p>
    <p>They can sub­se­quently use the iris and fa­cial scan­ners upon their depar­ture and when they re­turn to Sin­ga­pore, if they are still us­ing the same pass­port.</p>
    <p>How­ever, chil­dren be­low six years old must still use the man­ual clearance lanes, as they are not el­i­gi­ble for the fa­cial and iris scans, said ICA, not­ing that their phys­i­cal fea­tures and re­lated bio­met­rics are still de­vel­op­ing.</p>
    <p>DSP Tiang added that the fa­cial and iris scan tech­nol­ogy is a “build­ing block” to­wards the agency’s New Clearance Con­cept, where all Sin­ga­pore res­i­dents would be able to clear im­mi­gra­tion with­out pro­duc­ing their pass­ports. This is ex­pected to be in place by 2022.</p>
    <p>Those who are keen to reg­is­ter their iris and fa­cial bio­met­rics can ap­proach ICA of­fi­cers at the check­points when trav­el­ling.</p>
    <p>They may also do so when vis­it­ing the ICA build­ing for im­mi­gra­tion fa­cil­i­ties.</p>
    <p>With con­tact­less tech­nol­ogy, it al­lows us to cap­ture the bio­met­rics with­out any phys­i­cal con­tact with the ma­chine, so (the process) is hy­gienic. This is es­pe­cially im­por­tant, given this cur­rent Covid-19 pan­demic sit­u­a­tion.</p>
