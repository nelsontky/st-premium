    <p>Small and medium-sized en­ter­prises (SMEs) in Sin­ga­pore can tap the Gov­ern­ment’s tal­ent up­skilling schemes to ac­cel­er­ate their in­no­va­tion jour­neys, and leverage part­ner­ships with pub­lic agen­cies and other com­pa­nies to co-de­velop tech­nolo­gies for busi­ness needs.</p>
    <p>Speak­ing at SME Day yes­ter­day, Sec­ond Min­is­ter for Trade and In­dus­try Tan See Leng urged lo­cal en­ter­prises to em­brace science and tech­nol­ogy as a key com­pet­i­tive ad­van­tage in the global econ­omy, which has changed fun­da­men­tally amid the coro­n­avirus out­break.</p>
    <p>“To sail for­ward amidst the winds of change, SMEs must adapt, pivot and trans­form to thrive in the new en­vi­ron­ment,” he said at the event, which brings to­gether tech­nol­ogy and so­lu­tion providers from the pub­lic and pri­vate sec­tors.</p>
    <p>SME Day, or­gan­ised by the Agency for Science, Tech­nol­ogy and Re­search (A*Star) with sup­port from En­ter­prise Sin­ga­pore, is held in con­junc­tion with the Sin­ga­pore Week of In­no­va­tion and Tech­nol­ogy, a five-day hy­brid event that ends to­mor­row.</p>
    <p>In his speech, Dr Tan reaf­firmed the Gov­ern­ment’s com­mit­ment to in­vest in up­skilling the work­force and build­ing a crit­i­cal mass of re­search and de­vel­op­ment (R&D) tal­ent to meet in­dus­tries’ de­mands.</p>
    <p>He also de­scribed ini­tia­tives busi­nesses can tap, such as the Tech­nol­ogy for En­ter­prise Ca­pa­bil­ity Up­grad­ing (T-Up) pro­gramme to ac­cess R&D tal­ent.</p>
    <p>Un­der the scheme, A*Star sec­onds re­search sci­en­tists and engi­neers to lo­cal com­pa­nies to help them build in-house R&D ca­pa­bil­i­ties and en­hance their com­pet­i­tive­ness. More than 900 sci­en­tists and engi­neers have been sec­onded to work with over 800 lo­cal firms since the scheme started in 2003.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, A*Star an­nounced that three re­searchers were con­ferred the T-Up Ex­cel­lence Awards for their ex­cep­tional con­tri­bu­tions this year, while three oth­ers were given the T-Up Emerg­ing Tal­ent Awards for their po­ten­tial to meet in­dus­try needs and help lo­cal en­ter­prises grow.</p>
    <p>Among the win­ners of the Emerg­ing Tal­ent Award was Mr Tnay Guan Leong, a se­nior re­search en­gi­neer at A*Star’s Sin­ga­pore In­sti­tute of Man­u­fac­tur­ing Tech­nol­ogy.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing the six months he was sec­onded to aerospace en­gi­neer­ing firm Fidel En­gi­neer­ing and Trad­ing, Mr Tnay helped it build up new ma­chin­ing ca­pa­bil­i­ties to ac­cel­er­ate pro­duc­tion of com­plex marine and aerospace com­po­nents.</p>
    <p>He also trained the firm’s staff on ma­chin­ing the­o­ries and 3D com­puter-aided de­sign and man­u­fac­tur­ing soft­ware, which helped to in­crease man­power pro­duc­tiv­ity.</p>
    <p>A*Star and the Sin­ga­pore In­sti­tute of Tech­nol­ogy (SIT) also inked a mem­o­ran­dum of un­der­stand­ing yes­ter­day to es­tab­lish tri­par­tite re­la­tion­ships with lo­cal en­ter­prises to de­velop an in­no­va­tion and en­ter­prise tal­ent pipe­line for the in­dus­try and en­hance trans­fer of tech­no­log­i­cal know-how.</p>
    <p>The part­ner­ship will see A*Star re­searchers on sec­ond­ment to firms pro­vide tech­ni­cal ex­per­tise and men­tor­ship to SIT in­terns dur­ing their work-study pro­gramme. The scheme was pi­loted with lo­cal fin­tech STYL So­lu­tions in May.</p>
    <p>Pro­fes­sor Tan Sze Wee, A*Star’s as­sis­tant chief ex­ec­u­tive of en­ter­prise, said the agency is com­mit­ted to help­ing SMEs in­crease in­no­va­tion ca­pac­ity and global com­pet­i­tive­ness through sev­eral ini­tia­tives, such as its op­er­a­tion and tech­nol­ogy road-map­ping pro­gramme.</p>
    <p>“In this cur­rent cli­mate of eco­nomic dis­rup­tion, such col­lab­o­ra­tions are even more cru­cial to help com­pa­nies iden­tify tech­nol­ogy and skill gaps, as well as en­able them to pivot to new mar­kets or ex­plore in­no­va­tion of new prod­ucts and ser­vices,” he said.</p>
