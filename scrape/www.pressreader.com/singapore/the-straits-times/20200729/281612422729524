    <p>Sin­ga­pore hopes the United States is able to sta­bilise its re­la­tion­ship with China be­cause Asia de­pends on sta­ble ties between the two coun­tries to have a se­cure and pre­dictable en­vi­ron­ment to pros­per, Prime Min­is­ter Lee Hsien Loong said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>He made the point in an on­line in­ter­view when Amer­i­can busi­ness­man David Ruben­stein asked him what he would say to an in­com­ing US pres­i­dent ask­ing for ad­vice on how to strengthen the coun­try’s re­la­tion­ship with Asia.</p>
    <p>PM Lee said he would also en­cour­age the next pres­i­dent, be it Repub­li­can Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump, who is run­ning for re-elec­tion, or his Demo­cratic ri­val Joe Bi­den, to de­velop a bi­par­ti­san con­sen­sus on USAsian re­la­tions so that Amer­i­can for­eign pol­icy would last be­yond the pres­i­dent’s ad­min­is­tra­tion.</p>
    <p>He cited how the pre­vi­ous Obama ad­min­is­tra­tion’s re­bal­ance to­wards Asia had been sup­ported by many Asian coun­tries, but the Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion had a dif­fer­ent take on the is­sue, want­ing Ja­pan and South Korea to pay more for the US troops sta­tioned on their soil.</p>
    <p>“If you can es­tab­lish a sta­ble, pre­dictable pol­icy with bi­par­ti­san con­sen­sus, I think it would be a great help to all your friends and part­ners who want to be able to de­pend on you and to rely on you, with­out the risk that one day, the big power may sud­denly de­cide its in­ter­ests lie else­where,” he said.</p>
    <p>PM Lee also urged Wash­ing­ton to find a way to re­turn to the Tran­sPa­cific Part­ner­ship mega trade pact it had with­drawn from at the start of the Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion.</p>
    <p>Wor­ries about the di­rec­tion of US-China re­la­tions fea­tured heav­ily in the in­ter­view on Asia’s re­sponse to ten­sions between the two ma­jor pow­ers and Covid-19, hosted by the At­lantic Coun­cil, a Wash­ing­ton­based think-tank.</p>
    <p>PM Lee de­scribed the US-China ten­sions as very un­for­tu­nate, say­ing: “Ac­tions have been taken which have pro­voked counter-ac­tions, and the is­sues have metas­ta­sised and spread into all fields of the re­la­tion­ship... The way things have de­vel­oped over the last sev­eral years, you have very many ar­eas where there is not only con­tra­dic­tion, but also deep dis­trust, and this is cor­ro­sive and it is mak­ing a very dif­fi­cult re­la­tion­ship very dan­ger­ous.”</p>
    <p>He noted the re­la­tion­ship his­tor­i­cally tends to get tan­gled with pres­i­den­tial cam­paigns in elec­tion years, but that things set­tle down af­ter the new ad­min­is­tra­tion set­tles in.</p>
    <p>But this year’s elec­tion – due on Nov 3 – and its af­ter­math may be dif­fer­ent, he said.</p>
    <p>“I am not sure whether it will hap­pen this time be­cause the feel is quite dif­fer­ent, and the de­gree of an­i­mus and... bi­par­ti­san con­sen­sus on treat­ing China as a threat is quite ex­tra­or­di­nary. I fear that it may carry on past the elec­tion and if it does, I think that bodes ill for the world.”</p>
    <p>PM Lee set out two out­comes, both of which worry Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>The first is that the US will col­lide with China, and the other is the US will de­cide it has no stake in the re­gion and leave Asian coun­tries to their own de­fences. Sin­ga­pore and other coun­tries in the re­gion want good re­la­tions with China while keep­ing their deep re­la­tions with the US at the same time, he added.</p>
    <p>“Main­tain­ing that bal­ance and for the US to be able to play that role, and tend to your many in­ter­ests and your many friends and your in­flu­ence in the re­gion, I think that re­quires a sig­nif­i­cant amount of at­ten­tion from the United States pol­icy es­tab­lish­ment,” he said.</p>
    <p>“Oth­er­wise, a part of the world which has been cru­cial to you since the Sec­ond World War may be­come a prob­lem rather than an as­set to you.”</p>
    <p>The di­a­logue was mod­er­ated by Mr Ruben­stein, who heads the Amer­i­can private eq­uity firm The Car­lyle Group and is chair­man of the US non-profit think-tank Coun­cil on For­eign Re­la­tions.</p>
    <p>Mr Ruben­stein asked if PM Lee was wor­ried that China’s tech com­pa­nies would be­come so dom­i­nant that Sin­ga­pore would be de­pen­dent on them for tech­nol­ogy, not­ing that the US gov­ern­ment had ex­pressed con­cerns that telecom­mu­ni­ca­tions equip­ment from Chi­nese tech gi­ant Huawei could pose threats to na­tional se­cu­rity.</p>
    <p>PM Lee said Sin­ga­pore did busi­ness with Huawei and did not ex­clude it from its 5G net­work bidding process, al­though Huawei was not cho­sen this time round.</p>
    <p>Not­ing that no sys­tem was 100 per cent se­cure, he said: “It is a bal­ance of the risks and the pur­poses to which it is go­ing to be put, and how you can min­imise the risks and op­er­ate in a way which does not lead you to con­clude that you must do ev­ery­thing your­self.”</p>
    <p>He added: “If the sup­ply chain bi­fur­cates, it will be painful. It may still hap­pen, but we hope there will be trust between the two sides and it will be pos­si­ble for co­op­er­a­tion to con­tinue.</p>
    <p>“It does re­quire a sig­nif­i­cant de­gree of trust and a will­ing­ness to want to work to­gether, rather than to have a one up, one down out­come. And I am not sure that is the way things are go­ing now.”</p>
