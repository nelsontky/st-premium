    <p>KUALA LUMPUR • Malaysian po­lice will call up the or­gan­is­ers of a mass gath­er­ing out­side the Kuala Lumpur Courts Com­plex on Tues­day dur­ing the ver­dict on for­mer pre­mier Na­jib Razak’s cor­rup­tion case, fol­low­ing com­plaints of fail­ure to ob­serve so­cial dis­tanc­ing rules.</p>
    <p>Deputy In­spec­tor-Gen­eral of Po­lice Ma­zlan Man­sor said they had re­ceived a po­lice re­port from a mem­ber of the pub­lic on the gath­er­ing. “We are in­ves­ti­gat­ing the mat­ter and are aware of the pub­lic out­cry,” he told re­porters.</p>
    <p>He said some 900 peo­ple had gath­ered. Most were from Umno, the party that Na­jib led for nine years when he was prime min­is­ter.</p>
    <p>“They... did not com­ply with our con­di­tions, es­pe­cially on so­cial dis­tanc­ing. Maybe they were ex­cited in the mo­ment, but they should have known bet­ter,” said Datuk Ma­zlan.</p>
    <p>“We should be tak­ing care of one an­other es­pe­cially dur­ing the Covid-19 pan­demic,” he said, adding that peo­ple must re­alise that the pan­demic threat was not over.</p>
    <p>He said the po­lice would be call­ing the or­gan­is­ers to get their state­ments on the case.</p>
    <p>Ne­ti­zens took to so­cial me­dia on Tues­day to voice their con­cern over the lack of so­cial dis­tanc­ing among those who at­tended the court case.</p>
