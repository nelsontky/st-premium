    <p>The re­cent gen­eral elec­tion has made clear that a new po­lit­i­cal cul­ture is emerg­ing in Sin­ga­pore, said Pro­fes­sor Chan Heng Chee.</p>
    <p>The vet­eran diplo­mat noted yes­ter­day how on the one hand, the po­lit­i­cal style of the rul­ing Peo­ple’s Ac­tion Party (PAP) em­pha­sises strong gov­ern­ment, ef­fec­tive­ness, a le­gal­is­tic cul­ture and the de­liv­ery of a bet­ter life for the peo­ple – which some have called pa­ter­nal­is­tic.</p>
    <p>On the other hand, many cit­i­zens want to see Sin­ga­pore evolve into a full-fledged democ­racy. Ob­servers have also ex­pressed a de­sire for rules to be ap­plied to all po­lit­i­cal par­tic­i­pants fairly, and for ger­ry­man­der­ing to be re­strained, she noted.</p>
    <p>“Even as we yearn for demo­cratic com­pe­ti­tion, com­pet­i­tive pol­i­tics, we are ask­ing for a kinder and gen­tler pol­i­tics. We seem to be re­pulsed by the com­pet­i­tive, mean pol­i­tics of some Western democ­ra­cies,” she said in a live-streamed lec­ture.</p>
    <p>Prof Chan, an am­bas­sador-at­large, was de­liv­er­ing the last of three lec­tures as the In­sti­tute of Pol­icy Stud­ies’ 7th S R Nathan Fel­low for the Study of Sin­ga­pore. It was ti­tled Sin­ga­pore In A Time Of Flux: Op­ti­mism From The Jaws Of Gloom.</p>
    <p>Giv­ing her take on the elec­tion re­sult – the PAP won 83 of 93 seats and 61.24 per cent of the pop­u­lar vote, down from 69.9 per cent in 2015 – Prof Chan noted that youth aged 25 to 35 make up one of the big­gest groups in the pop­u­la­tion.</p>
    <p>The Work­ers’ Party, which won an un­prece­dented 10 seats and a sec­ond GRC, un­der­stood this, choos­ing youth­ful can­di­dates and is­sues that res­onated with Gen­er­a­tion Z vot­ers, she added. “Clearly this age group bought the op­po­si­tion mes­sage of the need for di­verse voices in Par­lia­ment and the need for checks and bal­ances,”she said.</p>
    <p>She noted that while con­ven­tional wis­dom says peo­ple be­come more con­ser­va­tive as they get older, a Pew Re­search re­port sug­gests that Amer­i­can mil­len­ni­als and Gen­er­a­tion Xers (those born be­tween 1965 and 1980) are dif­fer­ent from gen­er­a­tions be­fore them and have a dis­tinct, in­creas­ingly lib­eral out­look on many is­sues.</p>
    <p>“I ex­pect our mil­len­ni­als will con­tinue to sup­port di­verse voices and an op­po­si­tion in Par­lia­ment as a good thing, even as they age...The in­cum­bent party will have to un­der­stand this group bet­ter to win back their vote,” she added.</p>
    <p>Prof Chan noted that Sin­ga­pore had a one-party Par­lia­ment from 1968 till 1981, with pol­i­tics shift­ing to the bu­reau­cracy. From 1981, a re­politi­ci­sa­tion took place, and in 2011, the de­sire for po­lit­i­cal change erupted with the con­ver­gence of sev­eral “deeply felt so­cial and eco­nomic is­sues”, such as grow­ing in­equal­ity and im­mi­gra­tion, she added, de­scrib­ing this as the ar­rival of “pop­ulist pol­i­tics” in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>The PAP sub­se­quently man­aged to im­prove its vote share af­ter in­tro­duc­ing a slew of so­cial and eco­nomic poli­cies, and a se­ries of con­sul­ta­tions in 2012 and 2013. But with GE2020, “we see a fully re­politi­cised Sin­ga­pore”, she added.</p>
    <p>In her lec­ture, Prof Chan of­fered a few ideas on how Sin­ga­pore’s gov­er­nance model can shift. While the num­ber of op­po­si­tion par­ties has in­creased, there is also a “new mush­room­ing” of civil so­ci­ety or­gan­i­sa­tions at­tract­ing young, ed­u­cated and ide­al­is­tic peo­ple, she said.</p>
    <p>“The re­cent Covid-19 pan­demic shows that civil so­ci­ety or­gan­i­sa­tions have a role to play as an early warn­ing sys­tem for so­cial is­sues and fis­sures in so­ci­ety... no mat­ter how un­wel­come the feed­back,” said Prof Chan. These is­sues in­clude the plight of abused women, the age­ing poor, and for­eign work­ers. The Gov­ern­ment can work more closely with these groups, as both have com­mon goals, she sug­gested.</p>
    <p>More room for ex­pres­sion must also be given to en­cour­age Sin­ga­pore­ans, es­pe­cially the young, to think in­no­va­tively . “We should se­ri­ously dis­cour­age group­think,” she said. “If our po­lit­i­cal model needs fix­ing, it is how to ac­com­mo­date dif­fer­ences and di­verse views in our in­sti­tu­tions and our coun­try.”</p>
    <p>There is also a need to keep chip­ping away at the is­sue of in­equal­ity in or­der to guard against the threat of pop­ulism re­turn­ing to Sin­ga­pore’s pol­i­tics, she said. Crit­ics have rightly pointed out that Sin­ga­pore has high in­equal­ity com­pared with other de­vel­oped economies, Prof Chan said. But she noted that Sin­ga­pore’s in­come fig­ures show “ten­ta­tive change in the right di­rec­tion”, com­pared with the in­dus­tri­alised democ­ra­cies of the United States and Europe where in­comes have stag­nated or de­creased. In the past decade, me­dian in­comes here have risen by 32 per cent in real terms.</p>
    <p>She said Sin­ga­pore is for­tu­nate there are no ide­o­log­i­cally con­ser­va­tive par­ties ar­gu­ing against as­sist­ing the poor. “Rather, the de­bate is on why not give more, with the op­po­si­tion press­ing for big­ger sub­si­dies and giv­ing to more groups.”</p>
    <p>The Gov­ern­ment’s re­sponse dur­ing Covid-19 at­tests to its un­der­stand­ing of so­ci­etal needs, said Prof Chan, who added that its work in ad­dress­ing in­equal­ity is never done .</p>
    <p>“The goal­posts change all the time, and so elim­i­nat­ing poverty is al­ways a work in progress,” she said.</p>
