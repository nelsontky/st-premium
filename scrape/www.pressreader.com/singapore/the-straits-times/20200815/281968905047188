    <p>On Aug 17, 1995, two mil­lion peo­ple packed into Jakarta’s Merdeka Square to see a spec­tac­u­lar fire­works dis­play to mark In­done­sia’s 50th birth­day – an ex­trav­a­ganza spon­sored by the French gov­ern­ment.</p>
    <p>At home a few kilo­me­tres south, strong­man Suharto must have rel­ished his po­si­tion at that junc­ture. Firmly in the sad­dle after nearly 30 years in of­fice, he had suc­ceeded in crush­ing po­lit­i­cal op­po­nents and stay­ing in com­mand. And the econ­omy was grow­ing a ro­bust 7 per cent a year.</p>
    <p>Now, fast for­ward 25 years to Mon­day’s 75th in­de­pen­dence an­niver­sary. There won’t be any fire­works and, ow­ing to Covid-19, the pub­lic mood isn’t buoy­ant. Mil­lions re­cently lifted out of poverty could slide back in, and the econ­omy shrank 5.3 per cent in the April-June pe­riod, its big­gest con­trac­tion since the start of 1999, when In­done­sia was stum­bling after the pre­vi­ous year’s deadly Jakarta ri­ots and Mr Suharto’s dra­matic fall.</p>
    <p>Aside from Covid-19, present-day In­done­sia has a raft of prob­lems to deal with, in­clud­ing the threat posed by rad­i­cal Is­lam, a yawn­ing gap be­tween the rich and poor, en­vi­ron­men­tal degra­da­tion, woe­fully in­ad­e­quate schools and weak in­sti­tu­tions. (The pan­demic quickly showed how un­der­funded the state health­care sys­tem is.)</p>
    <p>But on Mon­day’s an­niver­sary of Sukarno declar­ing in­de­pen­dence from the Dutch (whom In­done­sia had to fight till 1949 to se­cure free­dom), it’s worth high­light­ing two trans­for­ma­tive changes to how In­done­sia is gov­erned that few would have imag­ined in 1995 – and which, if nur­tured, should help the coun­try be re­silient, stay to­gether and have more eq­ui­table growth.</p>
    <p>The first is the move from au­thor­i­tar­ian gov­ern­ment to democ­racy, in­clud­ing di­rect elec­tion of the pres­i­dent and the exit of the mil­i­tary from the leg­is­la­ture.</p>
    <p>The sec­ond is de­cen­tral­i­sa­tion, in which sig­nif­i­cant au­thor­ity and cen­tral gov­ern­ment funds have been shifted to lo­cal dis­tricts through­out the sprawl­ing ar­chi­pel­ago.</p>
    <p>These piv­otal changes were made early in the post-Suharto pe­riod, when the cries for “Re­for­masi” were the loud­est and were the hard­est to op­pose by mem­bers of the elite who had ben­e­fited greatly from Mr Suharto’s ten­ure. Vested in­ter­ests didn’t dis­ap­pear, for sure, but there was a win­dow in the early post-Suharto pe­riod when the 1945 Con­sti­tu­tion could be amended – some­thing the strong­man re­fused – and In­done­sia went through it. Help­ing to foster these ma­jor changes were some fears that In­done­sia could break up into mul­ti­ple pieces, like Yu­goslavia after Mar­shal Josip Broz Tito’s death.</p>
    <p>BUMPY ROAD TO DEMOC­RACY</p>
    <p>In fact, In­done­sia had its first dal­liance with democ­racy long be­fore 1998. In 1955, the coun­try’s first par­lia­men­tary elec­tion was free, fair and fought by more than 30 par­ties, in­clud­ing the Com­mu­nist Party. Two years later, amid po­lit­i­cal messi­ness and re­bel­lions against Jakarta’s rule in Su­ma­tra and Su­lawesi, Sukarno un­veiled “Guided Democ­racy”, an ef­fort at one-man rule that didn’t try to em­u­late Western-style democ­racy.</p>
    <p>In 1965, dur­ing events still shrouded in mys­tery, there was a failed coup at­tempt blamed on com­mu­nists, fol­lowed by mass killings of al­leged left­ists. Over time, Mr Suharto eased Sukarno out of power, was ap­pointed pres­i­dent and opened In­done­sia to for­eign in­vest­ment. Mr Suharto’s “New Or­der” gov­ern­ment kept con­trol un­til the Asian fi­nan­cial cri­sis of 1997 and 1998, when his now-os­si­fied sys­tem couldn’t main­tain its grip or keep de­liv­er­ing eco­nomic growth. Mr Suharto’s suc­ces­sor B.J. Habi­bie, for a long time his pro­tected pro­tege, sur­prised crit­ics by pro­mot­ing game-chang­ing re­forms.</p>
    <p>The demo­cratic path has had bumps – like many In­done­sian roads – but it is an im­pres­sive achieve­ment by any mea­sure that in 2004, just over six years fol­low­ing Mr Suharto’s fall, In­done­sians be­gan choos­ing their leader in di­rect pres­i­den­tial elec­tions. Pres­i­dents are lim­ited to two five-year terms, so there will not be an­other 32-year reign like Mr Suharto’s.</p>
    <p>The switch to democ­racy made it pos­si­ble for cur­rent Pres­i­dent Joko Widodo, the first leader not from the elite or the mil­i­tary, to win the post. He was seen as a re­fresh­ing change, and many young In­done­sians had high hopes that</p>
    <p>“Jokowi”, who had a small fur­ni­ture busi­ness in Cen­tral Java, would bring more change and strengthen democ­racy. But they have been dis­ap­pointed by developmen­ts such as the weak­en­ing of the in­de­pen­dent anti-cor­rup­tion body (KPK), scant at­ten­tion to hu­man rights or civil lib­er­ties, and ap­par­ent re-em­pow­er­ment of the mil­i­tary, which is in­volved in man­age­ment of the Covid-19 re­sponse at mul­ti­ple lev­els. (Since the press now has free­dom, un­like un­der Mr Suharto, Mr Joko drew flak from some Jakarta me­dia for slow moves and mis­steps in bat­tling the virus.)</p>
    <p>But there’s op­ti­mism that elec­toral democ­racy is here to stay. “There’s no sig­nif­i­cant group that doesn’t want democ­racy, ex­cept the Is­lamists,” says Ohio State Univer­sity In­done­sia ex­pert William Lid­dle.</p>
    <p>Aus­tralian National Univer­sity Pro­fes­sor Ed­ward Aspinall says there would be “great op­po­si­tion” to any move to halt di­rect elec­tions.</p>
    <p>DE­CEN­TRAL­I­SA­TION</p>
    <p>In­done­sia’s sec­ond key change – “de­sen­tral­isasi” – ended the con­cen­tra­tion of vir­tu­ally all ad­min­is­tra­tive power in a pres­i­dent’s hand.</p>
    <p>After Mr Suharto’s fall, lo­cal of­fi­cials were free to voice com­plaints, many of which were about rev­enue from their area’s re­sources be­ing taken by Jakarta, and not much com­ing back. A land­mark law pro­vid­ing for 25 per cent of state in­come to go to pro­vin­cial and district gov­ern­ments was passed in 1999.</p>
    <p>Giv­ing lo­cal gov­ern­ments money and au­thor­ity un­der­cut their com­plaints about Jakarta’s past dom­i­nance and turned some of­fi­cials into pro­po­nents of democ­racy.</p>
    <p>With de­cen­tral­i­sa­tion, and helped by other fac­tors, In­done­sia has “hit on the right for­mula for demo­cratic longevity”, in Pro­fes­sor Lid­dle’s view. Opin­ion polls about pos­si­ble 2024 pres­i­den­tial can­di­dates show sup­port for some pro­vin­cial gover­nors seen as per­form­ing well in bat­tling the out­break.</p>
    <p>Not sur­pris­ingly, de­cen­tral­i­sa­tion has spawned com­plaints about a deep-rooted prob­lem: cor­rup­tion. Some lo­cal of­fi­cials who couldn’t cash in when Mr Suharto was in con­trol now de­mand their share, and there’s been irk­some sets of lo­cal rules frus­trat­ing po­ten­tial in­vestors. A pa­per done for the Or­gan­i­sa­tion for Eco­nomic Co­op­er­a­tion and De­vel­op­ment in 2017 called cor­rup­tion a “huge is­sue at the re­gional level”.</p>
    <p>In past years, the KPK ar­rested and pros­e­cuted some may­ors and other lo­cal of­fi­cials. Now, it’s not clear if the weak­ened KPK will be equipped and able to look into cases far from Jakarta.</p>
    <p>Em­pow­er­ing dis­tricts has brought some com­mu­nity ben­e­fits. ISEAS - Yu­sof Ishak In­sti­tute visit­ing fel­low Made Supri­atma says one is the spiffy­ing up of some cities away from Jakarta. Den­pasar, Bali’s cap­i­tal, is now “much bet­ter than 35 years ago, you couldn’t have done that un­der a cen­tralised sys­tem”, he says.</p>
    <p>While Mr Supri­atma shares con­cerns about the qual­ity of In­done­sian democ­racy at present, he says it and de­cen­tral­i­sa­tion are in In­done­sia to stay – and that’s a good thing as “both are needed to keep the coun­try in­tact”.</p>
    <p>In­done­sia, is man­ag­ing di­rec­tor of con­sul­tancy firm Re­search­ing South­east Asia. He is an ad­junct senior fel­low at the S. Ra­jarat­nam School of In­ter­na­tional Stud­ies.</p>
