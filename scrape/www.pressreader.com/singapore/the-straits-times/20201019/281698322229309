    <p>From know­ing nearly noth­ing, he now at least un­der­stands a bit of it. He can also pro­nounce some com­mon words. He still can’t read an en­tire pas­sage fully, but he can at least recog­nise some words now.</p>
    <p>Chi­nese lan­guage classes were al­ways 10-year-old Ben­son See’s least favourite part of school, as he had trou­ble un­der­stand­ing his teacher, and could not read his text­books.</p>
    <p>His mother, Madam Su Lishan, said it was chal­leng­ing when he en­tered Pri­mary 1 at Kheng Cheng School.</p>
    <p>“When his teacher asked him a ques­tion dur­ing oral time, he couldn’t even un­der­stand it,” said the 37-year-old housewife.</p>
    <p>“It was also quite hard for him to ask ques­tions in class when there are more than 30 kids.”</p>
    <p>The fam­ily usu­ally con­verses in English at home.</p>
    <p>Said Madam Su: “We tried to teach him Chi­nese since he was young, but he just couldn’t seem to ab­sorb it and wasn’t in­ter­ested.</p>
    <p>“I bought for him Chi­nese books to prac­tise. He went through the strokes but there was no com­pre­hen­sion.”</p>
    <p>But Ben­son, who is now in Pri­mary 4, has re­ceived help from his school in the form of a new Mother Tongue Sup­port Pro­gramme con­ducted within cur­ricu­lum time.</p>
    <p>Since last year, he has been hav­ing daily Chi­nese lan­guage lessons in a smaller group.</p>
    <p>Not only does he get more at­ten­tion dur­ing this time, but he and his peers also take part in more in­ter­ac­tive ac­tiv­i­ties and play pic­ture and word recog­ni­tion games to fa­mil­iarise them­selves with Chi­nese char­ac­ters.</p>
    <p>Said Madam Su: “He’s us­ing the same text­book as be­fore, but the way he’s be­ing taught is so dif­fer­ent.</p>
    <p>“The teacher fo­cuses more on fun­da­men­tals and teaches the chil­dren</p>
    <p>MADAM SU LISHAN, whose son Ben­son See is re­ceiv­ing help from his school in the form of a new Mother Tongue Sup­port Pro­gramme.</p>
    <p>a few words at a time, or like ba­sic pro­nun­ci­a­tion and writ­ing.”</p>
    <p>She has since seen grad­ual im­prove­ment in her son’s Chi­nese.</p>
    <p>“From know­ing nearly noth­ing, he now at least un­der­stands a bit of it. He can also pro­nounce some com­mon words,” she said.</p>
    <p>“He still can’t read an en­tire pas­sage fully, but he can at least recog­nise some words now.”</p>
    <p>His hand­writ­ing is also bet­ter. “It’s clearer and nicer now,” she said.</p>
    <p>Madam Su said she is thank­ful for the pro­gramme – with­out it, she might have con­sid­ered send­ing her son for one-to-one Chi­nese tu­ition.</p>
    <p>“I was also afraid he wouldn’t be able to catch up in a group tu­ition class. In the school pro­gramme, he’s with his friends and I don’t have to send him out­side for tu­ition.”</p>
