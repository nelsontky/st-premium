    <p>MUMBAI • A su­per­nat­u­ral film cel­e­brat­ing a fe­male vig­i­lante who is mis­taken for a witch. A biopic about one of In­dia’s first woman com­bat pi­lots. A Mumbai take on Sex And The City fea­tur­ing four work­ing women.</p>
    <p>The con­tent of the shows is ex­tremely var­ied, but what they have in com­mon is that they are aimed at an ex­pand­ing fe­male au­di­ence in In­dia, and have been churned out by United States stream­ing giants such as Net­flix and Ama­zon Prime Video.</p>
    <p>The com­pa­nies are rewrit­ing the rules of I ndia’s US$34 bil­lion (S$46 bil­lion) en­ter­tain­ment in­dus­try, bring­ing more women in front of and be­hind the cam­era as they spend mil­lions of dol­lars to grab a share of Asia’s big­gest open mar­ket for stream­ing.</p>
    <p>An un­prece­dented surge in women-cen­tric con­tent high­lights the dis­rup­tion in In­dia’s en­ter­tain­ment in­dus­try, which has typ­i­cally re­lied on an A-list lead­ing man to lure in mostly male view­ers to score a block­buster.</p>
    <p>The shift partly stems from the lock­down amid the coron­avirus, which shut movie the­atres for months.</p>
    <p>With In­dian women in­creas­ingly will­ing to pay for con­tent they can view on their phones or lap­tops, stream­ing plat­forms are piv­ot­ing to this un­der-tapped mar­ket.</p>
    <p>As in­comes rise in In­dia’s US$2.9 tril­lion econ­omy, per capita spend­ing on me­dia and en­ter­tain­ment is ex­pected to al­most dou­ble to US$35 in In­dia next year from five years ear­lier, ac­cord­ing to data from Statista.</p>
    <p>A study last year by the Bos­ton Con­sult­ing Group said In­dian women are in­creas­ingly hav­ing a say in house­hold pur­chas­ing de­ci­sions.</p>
    <p>Another 2016 study by Google and A.T. Kear­ney es­ti­mated that In­dian women’s share of over­all on­line spend­ing will jump to 42 per cent by this year from 20 per cent in 2015.</p>
    <p>More than half of Net­flix films re­leased in In­dia this year have a fe­male pro­ducer or direc­tor, ac­cord­ing to Ms Monika Shergill, Net­flix In­dia’s vice-pres­i­dent of con­tent.</p>
    <p>Net­flix saw its per­cent­age of unique women vis­i­tors jump to 40 per cent last year from 26 per cent in 2018, ac­cord­ing to Com­score data.</p>
    <p>The Los Gatos, Cal­i­for­nia-based stream­ing com­pany is work­ing with 30 women producers and direc­tors this year, be­sides a dozen women writ­ers, Ms Shergill said.</p>
    <p>“Bet­ter ac­cess to the In­ter­net is push­ing creators to make con­tent that res­onates with women,” said Ms Ashiv­ini Yardi, pro­ducer of Net­flix’s hit se­ries Masaba Masaba, a show about a sin­gle mother and her fash­ion-de­signer daugh­ter.</p>
    <p>Ama­zon de­clined to share fig­ures for women view­er­ship of its shows, but said all six of its orig­i­nals re­leased in In­dia this year had women lead­ing the charge as creators, producers, writ­ers or direc­tors.</p>
    <p>To cap­ture a larger slice of fe­male view­ers, Ama­zon is “con­stantly talk­ing to more producers to have dif­fer­ent voices rep­re­sented”, said Mr Vi­jay Sub­ra­ma­niam, direc­tor and head of con­tent at the com­pany’s In­dia op­er­a­tions.</p>
    <p>In­dia’s ex­pe­ri­ence high­lights a global trend in which more women are in­volved in the cre­ation of stream­ing con­tent geared to­wards women.</p>
    <p>Net­flix had women helm­ing 20 per cent of its 53 orig­i­nal US films last year, nearly dou­ble the rate of rep­re­sen­ta­tion for women direc­tors across the 100 top-gross­ing US films of last year.</p>
    <p>While the push for equal­ity is gain­ing mo­men­tum in many mar­kets, the big­gest changes in In­dia are be­ing driven by women seek­ing more choice in the con­tent tar­geted at them.</p>
    <p>Watch­ing movies and tele­vi­sion shows are of­ten group ac­tiv­i­ties in In­dia, with the de­ci­sion on what to watch typ­i­cally driven by the men in the house­hold.</p>
    <p>Stream­ing is al­low­ing women more per­sonal choice in en­ter­tain­ment – at least in some seg­ments of the pop­u­la­tion.</p>
    <p>“Peo­ple can watch what they want, where they want and by them­selves on their per­sonal de­vices,” said Mr Dinkar Ay­ilavarapu, a part­ner at Bain & Co and head of tech­nol­ogy, me­dia and telecom­mu­ni­ca­tions.</p>
    <p>This al­lows stream­ing plat­forms to “cater to niches”, he said.</p>
    <p>At the same time, i n In­dia, women are lim­ited by their pur­chas­ing power be­cause those who can pay for a stream­ing ser­vice still form a “mi­nus­cule” per­cent­age of the mar­ket, said Pro­fes­sor Te­jaswini Ganti, as­so­ciate pro­fes­sor of an­thro­pol­ogy at New York Uni­ver­sity.</p>
    <p>On stream­ing plat­forms, producers with prospects of less fi­nan­cial risk and more creative free­dom are ex­per­i­ment­ing, said Prof Ganti, the au­thor of Pro­duc­ing Bol­ly­wood: In­side The Con­tem­po­rary Hindi Film In­dus­try.</p>
    <p>For in­stance, Ama­zon Prime’s pop­u­lar se­ries Four More Shots Please! ad­dresses largely taboo is­sues such as fe­male sex­u­al­ity and ho­mo­sex­u­al­ity.</p>
    <p>The show, the first of its kind in In­dia, fea­tures ca­sual and gay sex – a stark con­trast to Bol­ly­wood films of yore.</p>
    <p>“It opens up a sto­ry­teller’s world,” said An­vita Dutt, writer and direc­tor of Net­flix’s Bulb­bul, the film about the fe­male vig­i­lante who is mis­taken for a witch. “Some­one in Spain could be watch­ing my film.”</p>
