    <p>LONDON Bri­tain has handed to the US au­thor­i­ties ev­i­dence re­lated to two mem­bers of an Is­lamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS) mur­der cell dubbed the “Bea­tles”, clear­ing the way to a trial af­ter Washington said it would not seek the death penalty for the duo.</p>
    <p>The ev­i­dence re­gard­ing El Shafee El­sheikh and Alexanda Kotey “has now fi­nally been trans­ferred to the US”, Bri­tish Home Sec­re­tary Priti Pa­tel said on Twit­ter on Tues­day. “I sin­cerely hope that jus­tice for the vic­tims and their fam­i­lies will now be served,” she said.</p>
    <p>El­sheikh and Kotey, who have been stripped of their Bri­tish cit­i­zen­ship, are in the cus­tody of US forces in Iraq. The United States wants to try them for the mur­der of jour­nal­ists James Fo­ley and Steven Sot­loff, and aid worker Peter Kas­sig be­tween 2014 and 2015.</p>
    <p>The duo’s four-mem­ber cell was dubbed “the Bea­tles” by their cap­tives due to their English ac­cents. They tor­tured and killed vic­tims, in­clud­ing by be­head­ing, and ISIS re­leased videos of the deaths for pro­pa­ganda pur­poses.</p>
    <p>The trans­fer of ma­te­rial in­tended to help the pair’s pros­e­cu­tion came af­ter El­sheikh’s mother lost a le­gal chal­lenge in London’s High Court.</p>
    <p>Ms Maha El­gi­zouli’s lawyers had told the court that Ms Pa­tel’s de­ci­sion to press on with the trans­fer breached Bri­tain’s Data Pro­tec­tion Act. But the judges ruled that the Home Sec­re­tary was within her rights.</p>
    <p>“The con­clu­sion that, even if Mr El­sheikh could be pros­e­cuted in Eng­land, it would still be nec­es­sary and pro­por­tion­ate to trans­fer the data to the US au­thor­i­ties re­mained a con­clu­sion prop­erly open to the Sec­re­tary of State,” the rul­ing said.</p>
    <p>Rel­a­tives of two Bri­tons who had been killed by the ISIS cell wel­comed the break­through yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The fam­i­lies of Mr Alan Hen­ning and Mr David Haines said the rul­ing per­mit­ting the Bri­tish government to share ev­i­dence with the US au­thor­i­ties about the sus­pects was a “huge re­sult for us”.</p>
    <p>“We have only ever wanted to see these two men be­ing held ac­count­able and brought to jus­tice through a fair trial for their al­leged ac­tions,” they said in a state­ment re­leased by the char­ity Hostage In­ter­na­tional.</p>
    <p>A two-year le­gal im­passe con­cern­ing the sus­pects was bro­ken last month when US At­tor­ney-Gen­eral Bill Barr said they would be spared ex­e­cu­tion if con­victed af­ter trial in the US.</p>
    <p>But he also warned that un­less the Bri­tish ev­i­dence was shared by Oct 15, Kotey and El­sheikh would be handed over for pros­e­cu­tion and pos­si­ble ex­e­cu­tion in Iraq.</p>
    <p>Mr Barr’s in­ter­ven­tion put the onus on Ms Pa­tel to see if the Bri­tish sys­tem could over­come the court chal­lenge by El­sheikh’s mother and share the ev­i­dence – said to be damn­ing wire­taps – with the US au­thor­i­ties.</p>
    <p>The US Depart­ment of Jus­tice wel­comed Tues­day’s court rul­ing in London and ex­pressed grat­i­tude to Bri­tain for trans­fer­ring the ev­i­dence.</p>
    <p>“We re­main com­mit­ted to hold­ing these de­fen­dants ac­count­able and ob­tain­ing jus­tice for the vic­tims of their ter­ror­ist ac­tiv­ity,” it said in a state­ment.</p>
