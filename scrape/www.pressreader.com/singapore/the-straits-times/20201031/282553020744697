    <p>Mr Quek See Tiat will be­come chair­man of Sin­ga­pore’s Ac­count­ing Standards Coun­cil (ASC), while Mr Des­mond Chin will join as a new mem­ber, start­ing to­mor­row.</p>
    <p>Deputy Prime Min­is­ter Heng Swee Keat, who is also Fi­nance Min­is­ter, made the ap­point­ments, the Min­istry of Fi­nance (MOF) an­nounced in a press state­ment yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Mr Quek, cur­rently chair­man­des­ig­nate, will suc­ceed Mr Kevin Kwok, who has helmed the coun­cil since Novem­ber 2015.</p>
    <p>Un­der Mr Kwok’s lead­er­ship, the ASC is­sued the Sin­ga­pore Fi­nan­cial Re­port­ing Standards (In­ter­na­tional) to achieve full con­ver­gence with the In­ter­na­tional Fi­nan­cial Re­port­ing Standards for Sin­ga­pore-listed is­suers.</p>
    <p>Mr Quek is also the au­dit com­mit­tee chair­man on the board of the Mone­tary Au­thor­ity of Sin­ga­pore and the pres­i­dent of the Coun­cil for Es­tate Agen­cies.</p>
    <p>He also serves on the boards of Sin­ga­pore Tech­nolo­gies Engi­neer­ing, Te­masek Foun­da­tion Con­nects and Sin­ga­pore Press Hold­ings, which pub­lishes The Straits Times and The Busi­ness Times, among other ti­tles.</p>
    <p>Mr Quek was deputy chair­man of Price­wa­ter­house­Coop­ers un­til 2012, and had worked at the firm since 1987.</p>
    <p>MOF said Mr Quek has ex­ten­sive au­dit and busi­ness ad­vi­sory ex­pe­ri­ence. He has been in­volved in plan­ning, ex­e­cut­ing and manag­ing au­dits of large listed com­pa­nies in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, Mr Chin will be the com­mis­sioner of char­i­ties and ex­ec­u­tive di­rec­tor of the Reg­istry of Co-op­er­a­tive So­ci­eties and Mu­tual Ben­e­fits Or­gan­i­sa­tions from next month.</p>
    <p>He joined the Sin­ga­pore Prison Ser­vice (SPS) in 1990 and was ap­pointed Com­mis­sioner of Pris­ons in 2016. Dur­ing his stint, new regimes at SPS were im­ple­mented, which low­ered the re­cidi­vism rates of young of­fend­ers and drug in­mates over time.</p>
    <p>Mr Chin also served as chief ex­ec­u­tive of Yel­low Rib­bon Sin­ga­pore from 2005 to 2010. He was awarded the Pub­lic Ad­min­is­tra­tion Medal (Gold) this year.</p>
    <p>He is com­ing on board as Mr Ang Hak Seng re­tires from ASC.</p>
    <p>Other ASC mem­bers in­clude deputy chair­man Che­ung Pui Yuen, who is also chief ex­ec­u­tive of Deloitte & Touche; the Ac­count­ing and Cor­po­rate Reg­u­la­tory Au­thor­ity’s chief ex­ec­u­tive Ong Khiaw Hong; Ac­coun­tant-Gen­eral Ow Fook Chuen; and Far East Or­ga­ni­za­tion ex­ec­u­tive di­rec­tor and chief fi­nan­cial of­fi­cer Koh Kah Sek.</p>
