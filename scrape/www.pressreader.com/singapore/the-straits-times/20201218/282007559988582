    <p>Much of the dis­cus­sion on Covid-19 has rightly fo­cused on the im­me­di­ate health­care needs of Sin­ga­pore­ans and the eco­nomic re­ces­sion un­leashed on busi­nesses, house­holds and in­di­vid­u­als.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore must also guard against not only an eco­nomic re­ces­sion, but also a so­cial re­ces­sion. A so­cial re­ces­sion, marked by lone­li­ness and iso­la­tion, can be viewed as a fray­ing of so­cial bonds that will fur­ther un­ravel the longer we go with­out hu­man in­ter­ac­tion.</p>
    <p>Thus, Prime Min­is­ter Lee Hsien Loong’s an­nounce­ment that Sin­ga­pore will tran­sit into phase three of its re­open­ing is wel­come news in­deed (S’pore to be­gin phase 3 on Dec 28, Dec 15). This is the first step in a long and ar­du­ous jour­ney to lift Sin­ga­pore out of eco­nomic re­ces­sion and hope­fully pre­vent a so­cial re­ces­sion here.</p>
    <p>As Sin­ga­pore re­cov­ers from an eco­nomic re­ces­sion, it must guard against lone­li­ness in its com­mu­ni­ties. It was re­ported in Oc­to­ber that more peo­ple in Sin­ga­pore have been seek­ing help for men­tal health is­sues amid the Covid-19 pan­demic, with a spike in calls to sui­cide helplines (More seek help for men­tal health is­sues amid pan­demic, Oct 10).</p>
    <p>As Sin­ga­pore’s pop­u­la­tion ages, more se­niors are liv­ing alone, whether by choice or oth­er­wise.</p>
    <p>Some may still be liv­ing with their fam­i­lies, yet feel lonely. We need to guard against a fu­ture pub­lic health is­sue: a lone­li­ness epi­demic in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>Lone­li­ness is not a sin­gle emotion. It is a com­plex mix of many dif­fer­ent emo­tional states such as anger, fear, grief, in­se­cu­rity and un­cer­tainty.</p>
    <p>There is a trend to­wards one-per­son house­holds. In 2000, they made up 8.2 per cent of res­i­dent house­holds in Sin­ga­pore. That pro­por­tion is now 15 per cent, or 208,000 house­holds.</p>
    <p>If we are not care­ful, many Sin­ga­pore­ans would ex­pe­ri­ence so­cial death – where they are treated as non-ex­is­tent – be­fore their phys­i­cal death, of­ten in iso­la­tion.</p>
    <p>The past year should be a wake-up call for Sin­ga­pore on many lev­els, in terms of how we think about our so­ci­ety and its struc­tural in­equities; how we ex­am­ine our sup­port net­works, how we think about liv­ing and what con­sti­tutes a good death; how we grieve; and how to strengthen our pal­lia­tive care sup­port in the midst of an eco­nomic and so­cial re­ces­sion.</p>
    <p>As Sin­ga­pore re­in­forces its safe man­age­ment regime in its fight against the virus, we must also re­in­force our na­tion’s so­cial sol­i­dar­ity and net­works and not al­low so­cial dis­tance to be the de­fault prac­tice in our re­la­tion­ships with one an­other. Chen Ji­axi</p>
    <p>As Sin­ga­pore re­cov­ers from an eco­nomic re­ces­sion, it must guard against lone­li­ness in its com­mu­ni­ties.</p>
