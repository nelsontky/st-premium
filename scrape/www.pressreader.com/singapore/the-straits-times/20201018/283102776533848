    <p>If this year has taught us any­thing, it is that life is un­cer­tain. Through this lens, I have started to aban­don some con­ser­va­tive per­sonal fi­nance prin­ci­ples. This sum­mer, I went against the adage of “stay­ing the course” with re­tire­ment and sold some stocks. I also bought a house in what can be con­sid­ered a risky en­vi­ron­ment. To date, I have no re­grets.</p>
    <p>In my lat­est move away from what many fi­nan­cial ex­perts preach, I have for­gone the as­pi­ra­tion of leav­ing a fi­nan­cial legacy.</p>
    <p>The con­cept of be­queath­ing an in­her­i­tance just seems to make less sense to­day.</p>
    <p>In­stead, I want to ex­pe­ri­ence my legacy by spend­ing most, if not all, of my money on mean­ing­ful ex­pe­ri­ences and in­vest­ing in the peo­ple and causes I be­lieve in – all be­fore I leave earth. This fi­nan­cial phi­los­o­phy has grown in­creas­ingly pop­u­lar with the ul­tra-wealthy.</p>
    <p>Mrs Lau­rene Pow­ell Jobs, who in­her­ited more than US$20 bil­lion (S$27.15 bil­lion) from her late hus­band, Ap­ple co-founder Steve Jobs, vows to give away all her as­sets dur­ing her liv­ing years, con­tribut­ing to so­cial and eco­nomic causes that need fi­nan­cial sup­port.</p>
    <p>Be­fore that, mu­si­cian St­ing, Mi­crosoft founder Bill Gates and prom­i­nent in­vestor War­ren Buf­fett all pledged to not leave their chil­dren much, if any, in­her­i­tance.</p>
    <p>But the idea should be­come main­stream. Af­ter speak­ing with en­tre­pre­neur Bill Perkins about his new book, Die With Zero: All You Can From Your Money And Your Life, I was shocked to find my­self con­vinced that spend­ing more money while you are alive is more ful­fill­ing than leav­ing be­hind a nest egg.</p>
    <p>“With each year that passes, our abil­ity to con­vert dol­lars into pos­i­tive life ex­pe­ri­ences de­clines over time,” Mr Perkins tells me.</p>
    <p>The “op­ti­mal util­ity of money”, as he calls it, is us­ing money to have the max­i­mum great­est ex­pe­ri­ences you can in your liv­ing years.</p>
    <p>It is im­por­tant be­cause ex­pe­ri­ences are what ac­tu­ally drive ful­fil­ment and hap­pi­ness. “I’m more about sav­ing your life than sav­ing your money,” Mr Perkins says.</p>
    <p>Of course, the chal­lenge with this ap­proach is to not die with less than zero, leav­ing debt be­hind for some­one else. The phi­los­o­phy does not give my hus­band and me per­mis­sion to over­spend.</p>
    <p>In­stead, it forces us to prac­tise re­straint and de­lib­er­a­tion as we choose how to al­lo­cate our money while we are alive.</p>
    <p>Yes, we still need to save for re­tire­ment, but pri­mar­ily with our per­sonal needs (and the needs of any re­main­ing de­pen­dants) only in mind. We have de­ter­mined to have a spe­cific mon­e­tary goal.</p>
    <p>In his book, Mr Perkins calls this your per­sonal “sur­vival num­ber”. It is the amount you need to sup­port your­self with re­gard to health, shel­ter and food when you no longer have much in­come.</p>
    <p>Your sur­vival num­ber is more bare-bones than the stan­dard re­tire­ment sav­ings rec­om­men­da­tion of need­ing be­tween eight and 10 times your salary or liv­ing off 80 per cent of your pre-re­tire­ment in­come. Maybe that fig­ure can be closer to 40 per cent or 50 per cent, es­pe­cially if you down­size ear­lier or live in a more af­ford­able place.</p>
    <p>For ex­am­ple, we just bought our home in New Jer­sey and plan to live here for the next 15 years or so un­til the chil­dren are fin­ished with high school. Af­ter that, it would not re­ally make fi­nan­cial sense to keep our res­i­dence.</p>
    <p>OP­TI­MISE SPEND­ING</p>
    <p>For us, that is putting money to­wards sup­port­ing our chil­dren’s ed­u­ca­tion and well-be­ing, trav­el­ling and giv­ing back. Be­fore aim­ing to die with zero, I wanted my fam­ily to be able to spend an en­tire month each sum­mer liv­ing in a for­eign coun­try.</p>
    <p>Now, this dream looks all the more worth­while as the type of en­rich­ing ex­pe­ri­ence I value. And, de­pend­ing on what hap­pens with travel post-Covid-19, it can be more achiev­able, since I will not be putting it off just to have a bit more saved for re­tire­ment.</p>
    <p>The idea of leav­ing non-profit or­gan­i­sa­tions money in our will also feels a bit detri­men­tal to the causes we want to sup­port. Why not give sooner if we can?</p>
    <p>To that end, I have au­to­mated some of my giv­ing plans sim­i­lar to how we con­trib­ute for re­tire­ment.</p>
    <p>RE­THINK RE­TIRE­MENT</p>
    <p>This is an im­por­tant con­sid­er­a­tion for those (out­side the su­per-rich) who want to die without any debt and spend their later years liv­ing on “just enough”. I am al­ready think­ing about get­ting my real es­tate li­cence in my 50s to gen­er­ate some ad­di­tional in­come and sup­ple­ment our needs in re­tire­ment.</p>
    <p>HAVE A PLAN FOR THE CHIL­DREN</p>
    <p>The con­cept of be­queath­ing an in­her­i­tance just seems to make less sense to­day. In­stead, I want to ex­pe­ri­ence my legacy by spend­ing most, if not all, of my money on mean­ing­ful ex­pe­ri­ences and in­vest­ing in the peo­ple and causes I be­lieve in – all be­fore I leave earth.</p>
    <p>Not leav­ing an in­her­i­tance to your chil­dren does not mean you do not care about them. In­stead, it means that you bestow your wealth upon them when they are young and most likely work­ing to start a busi­ness or a fam­ily or in­vest­ing.</p>
    <p>Do we risk spoil­ing them?</p>
    <p>Not if we ex­plain our plan and if they un­der­stand that the money they are re­ceiv­ing in por­tions is to help them build a strong and mean­ing­ful life for them­selves and their chil­dren. We also have life in­sur­ance, as that is in­te­gral to tak­ing care of our chil­dren, should one of us die sooner than ex­pected.</p>
    <p>I am not sure what the after­life has in store for us, but I do trust that this al­ter­na­tive fi­nan­cial frame­work will en­able us to make the most of our liv­ing years.</p>
    <p>And the chil­dren? They will be all right.</p>
