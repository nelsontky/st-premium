    <p>Some com­pa­nies are mod­i­fy­ing their of­fice space in the light of the in­creas­ing preva­lence of peo­ple hav­ing to work from home.</p>
    <p>Take cre­ative agency DDB Group Sin­ga­pore, whose of­fice is in the Kal­lang area.</p>
    <p>The firm has re­moved old cup­boards and closed off pantries to cre­ate ar­eas for “pods”, or mini rooms.</p>
    <p>The pods, which were com­pleted last week, al­low em­ploy­ees to make video calls in pri­vate, even though only 10 per cent of the com­pany’s 300-strong staff come into the of­fice. Ev­ery­one else works from home.</p>
    <p>Deputy chief ex­ec­u­tive Jeff Cheong said build­ing the rooms was part of a num­ber of phys­i­cal changes to the of­fice as the firm ad­justs to the new nor­mal of hav­ing split teams for what may be a very long time.</p>
    <p>“Ev­ery­one holds video calls for meet­ings all the time now, and it can get very loud and dis­tract­ing if peo­ple are shout­ing into their mi­cro­phones,” he said.</p>
    <p>“Some changes to the way the of­fice is de­signed are nec­es­sary as we adapt to new ways of work­ing.”</p>
    <p>Staff will also hot-desk rather than have des­ig­nated desks as most of them do not need to be in the build­ing.</p>
    <p>Other plans in­clude re­duc­ing the to­tal of­fice space – now spread over three lev­els – by up to 15 per cent, which will bring rental re­duc­tions, he added.</p>
    <p>Such changes come after Ed­u­ca­tion Min­is­ter Lawrence Wong, cochair­man of the multi-min­istry task force fight­ing Covid-19, ad­vised com­pa­nies to make work-from-home the de­fault mode for many months to come.</p>
    <p>Hu­man re­source tech­nol­ogy firm Peo­pleStrong did away with of­fice space al­to­gether after its lease at co-work­ing space WeWork ex­pired re­cently. Its staff of around 10 now all work from home.</p>
    <p>Mr Adrian Tan, the com­pany’s prac­tice leader for the fu­ture of work tech, said: “It didn’t make sense for us to pay for an of­fice that we won’t go back to, at least for an in­def­i­nite pe­riod of time.”</p>
    <p>But as­so­ci­ate pro­fes­sor of man­age­ment and or­gan­i­sa­tion Sam Yam of the Na­tional Uni­ver­sity of Sin­ga­pore Busi­ness School warned: “Re­mov­ing phys­i­cal of­fice spa­ces does save money from a short-term per­spec­tive, but at what costs?</p>
    <p>“Re­search has shown that pos­i­tive so­cial in­ter­ac­tions with col­leagues and su­per­vi­sors build strong so­cial re­la­tion­ships, which in turn leads to higher lev­els of sat­is­fac­tion and com­mit­ment, and lower lev­els of turnover.</p>
    <p>“All of these fac­tors con­trib­ute to the long-term suc­cess of any firm.”</p>
