    <p>•</p>
    <p>More than 3,900 peo­ple died of Covid-19 in the United States on Wed­nes­day, ac­cord­ing to a count re­leased by Johns Hop­kins Univer­sity, mark­ing a new daily record for fa­tal­i­ties from the coro­n­avirus.</p>
    <p>The Bal­ti­more-based univer­sity said that 3,927 peo­ple had died of the coro­n­avirus in the 24 hours be­fore 8.30pm on Wed­nes­day in the US, which is the worst-hit coun­try in the world, while 189,671 new cases had been recorded.</p>
    <p>That brings the US to­tal to around 19.7 mil­lion in­fec­tions and 341,845 deaths since the pan­demic be­gan.</p>
    <p>Dr An­thony Fauci, the coun­try’s lead­ing i nfec­tious dis­eases ex­pert, had warned on Sun­day that the worst of the pan­demic was likely yet to come, with the death toll ris­ing at an alarming rate in the win­ter months and af­ter ma­jor hol­i­day gath­er­ings.</p>
    <p>Dr Fauci said on Wed­nes­day that he fore­sees the US achiev­ing enough col­lec­tive Covid-19 im­mu­nity through vac­ci­na­tions to re­gain “some sem­blance of nor­mal­ity” by au­tumn of this year, de­spite early set­backs in the vac­cine roll-out.</p>
    <p>The US has be­gun a mass cam­paign of vac­ci­na­tions and 2.8 mil­lion peo­ple have al­ready re­ceived jabs, but that is well be­hind the 20 mil­lion in­oc­u­la­tions that Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump’s ad­min­is­tra</p>
    <p>tion has promised by the end of last year.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, a se­cond US case of the highly trans­mis­si­ble Covid-19 vari­ant that had emerged in Bri­tain has been de­tected in Cal­i­for­nia, a day af­ter Colorado re­ported the na­tion’s first known in­fec­tion. Cal­i­for­nia Gov­er­nor Gavin New­som re­vealed the case dur­ing a virtual con­ver­sa­tion with Dr Fauci.</p>
    <p>Colorado of­fi­cials said on Wed­nes­day that they are in­vesti</p>
    <p>gat­ing another pos­si­ble in­fec­tion in­volv­ing the new strain in their state, and that tests were be­ing con­ducted on sam­ples from other peo­ple who may have been ex­posed to the mu­ta­tion.</p>
    <p>“I am not sur­prised that you have a case,” Dr Fauci, di­rec­tor of the Na­tional In­sti­tute of Al­lergy and In­fec­tious Dis­eases, told Mr New­som dur­ing their con­ver­sa­tion.</p>
    <p>“We likely will be see­ing re­ports from other states too.”</p>
    <p>In Colorado, both pa­tients were mem­bers of a Na­tional Guard unit that was sent on Dec 23 to the Good Sa­mar­i­tan So­ci­ety Nurs­ing Home in Simla, Colorado, as the fa­cil­ity was strug­gling with staff short­ages caused by a coro­n­avirus out­break.</p>
    <p>Rou­tine test­ing con­ducted the day af­ter they ar­rived showed tell­tale signs of the re­cently emerged vari­ant that has been spread­ing widely in Bri­tain.</p>
    <p>The first case, found in a man in his 20s, was con­firmed on Tues­day.</p>
    <p>The se­cond Colorado case is “highly sus­pi­cious” but still un­der eval­u­a­tion, with re­sults likely within a week, ac­cord­ing to state sci­en­tific di­rec­tor Emily Tra­vanty.</p>
    <p>Ge­netic se­quenc­ing of 22 ad­di­tional sam­ples by Colorado health of­fi­cials has not turned up any other signs of the vari­ant, known as B.1.1.7.</p>
    <p>Sci­en­tists do not know how widely the new strain may have spread in the US.</p>
    <p>But the an­swer to that ques­tion will colour vir­tu­ally every as­pect of the na­tion’s pan­demic re­sponse: hos­pi­tal treat­ment, com­mu­nity lock­downs, school clo­sures and more.</p>
    <p>The ar­rival of the vari­ant also makes it all the more im­per­a­tive that Amer­i­cans re­ceive vac­ci­na­tions in great num­bers, and more quickly, sci­en­tists said.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, Dr Fauci said that as­sum­ing the broad vac­ci­na­tion cam­paign pro­gresses as it should through May, June and July, “by the time we get to the early fall, we will have enough good herd im­mu­nity to be able to re­ally get back to some strong sem­blance of nor­mal­ity – schools, the­atres, sports events, restau­rants”.</p>
