    <p>Real es­tate man­age­ment ser­vices group LHN is plan­ning to launch a mixed-use de­vel­op­ment at 1557 Kep­pel Road by the mid­dle of next month.</p>
    <p>The in­te­grated space, which is lo­cated at the fringe of the Cen­tral Busi­ness District, will be used for com­mer­cial and res­i­den­tial pur­poses.</p>
    <p>It con­sists of three blocks span­ning 96,299.05 sq ft, Catal­istlisted LHN said, in a bourse fil­ing yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Block C, the prop­erty’s main block ded­i­cated to of­fice spa­ces, is three storeys high. Each level is about 24,000 sq ft with units that have a ceil­ing height of 5.5m to 6.5m. The block also comes with in-house din­ing op­tions and a gym for ten­ants and work­ers.</p>
    <p>The block is ex­pected to at­tract com­mer­cial ten­ants, such as clin­ics, ship­ping com­pa­nies, in­surance, back-end bank­ing, in­for­ma­tion tech­nol­ogy, and e-com­merce providers, LHN said.</p>
    <p>Blocks A and B will house 47 ser­viced apart­ment units un­der the group’s Coli­woo brand. Each co­l­iv­ing unit comes fully equipped with kitch­enettes, smart TVs, mi­crowaves, fridges and a washer-cum-dryer. A gar­den area which dou­bles as a com­mu­nal space is also avail­able for res­i­dents to use.</p>
    <p>The de­vel­op­ment is close to Ou­tram Park and Tanjong Pa­gar MRT sta­tions. It is also near the up­com­ing Can­ton­ment MRT sta­tion, which is set for com­ple­tion by 2025.</p>
    <p>Mr Kelvin Lim, LHN Group ex­ec­u­tive chair­man, ex­ec­u­tive direc­tor and group manag­ing direc­tor, said: “Recog­nis­ing the chang­ing mar­ket de­mands for co-liv­ing and work­ing spa­ces, we have cre­ated our sec­ond in­te­grated de­vel­op­ment with modern work­ing pro­fes­sion­als and their life­styles in mind.”</p>
    <p>The 1557 Kep­pel Road project is LHN Group’s sec­ond mixed-use de­vel­op­ment.</p>
    <p>Its first in­te­grated project, 10 Rae­burn Park, also func­tions as the group’s head­quar­ters.</p>
    <p>LHN shares closed at 19.3 cents yes­ter­day, up 0.8 cents or 4.3 per cent.</p>
