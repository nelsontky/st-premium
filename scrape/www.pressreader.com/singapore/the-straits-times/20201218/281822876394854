    <p>WASH­ING­TON • The US set a grim dou­ble record on Wed­nes­day, notch­ing up more than 3,700 deaths and over 250,000 new Covid-19 cases in 24 hours, ac­cord­ing to fig­ures from Johns Hop­kins Univer­sity.</p>
    <p>The coun­try has seen a spec­tac­u­lar spike in Covid-19 in­fec­tions for more than a month now, with some 113,000 peo­ple now hos­pi­talised ow­ing to the virus, also a new record, ac­cord­ing to data from the De­part­ment of Health and Hu­man Ser­vices.</p>
    <p>The tally marks the third time in the past week that the United States has crossed the 3,000 daily deaths thresh­old.</p>
    <p>The pre­vi­ous 24-hour record was set in late April, at the height of the coun­try’s first wave – which never to­tally ended. Over the past two weeks, the num­ber of new Covid-19 cases in 24 hours has climbed above 200,000 for 11 out of 14 days.</p>
    <p>Wed­nes­day’s ex­act death toll was 3,784 fa­tal­i­ties over the pre­vi­ous 24 hours lead­ing up to 8.30pm (0130 GMT Thurs­day).</p>
    <p>Health of­fi­cials had feared the US Thanks­giv­ing hol­i­day late last month would lead to a fresh out­break of the novel coro­n­avirus af­ter mil­lions of Amer­i­cans trav­elled to join friends and fam­ily.</p>
    <p>Ex­perts now fear the sit­u­a­tion will be­come even more dire fol­low­ing end-of-year cel­e­bra­tions, in­clud­ing the Christ­mas hol­i­day.</p>
    <p>The lat­est records were set even as the US un­der­goes its first week of a mass vac­ci­na­tion pro­gramme aimed at stop­ping the surg­ing pan­demic. On Mon­day, the first Pfizer-BioNTech vac­cine in­jec­tions were ad­min­is­tered in the US, although the au­thor­i­ties warned it will still be months be­fore a large enough por­tion of the pop­u­la­tion is im­mu­nised.</p>
    <p>Faced with the ur­gency of the sit­u­a­tion and fears of vac­cine short­ages, the Food and Drug Ad­min­is­tra­tion (FDA) said on Wed­nes­day that six or even seven doses could be squeezed out of vials that were sup­posed to con­tain only five doses to avoid un­used vac­cine be­ing dis­carded.</p>
    <p>“At this time, given the pub­lic health emer­gency, FDA is ad­vis­ing that it is ac­cept­able to use ev­ery full dose ob­tain­able,” it said in a tweet, adding that Pfizer was on board with the rec­om­men­da­tion.</p>
