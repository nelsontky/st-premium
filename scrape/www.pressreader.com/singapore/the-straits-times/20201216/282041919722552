    <p>A former em­ployee of oil gi­ant Shell Eastern Pe­tro­leum yes­ter­day ad­mit­ted to be­ing in­volved in a con­spir­acy to mis­ap­pro­pri­ate about US$36.1 mil­lion (S$49.1 mil­lion) worth of gas oil.</p>
    <p>In­dian na­tional Sadagopan Prem­nath, 40, pleaded guilty to four charges of con­spir­ing to mis­ap­pro­pri­ate gas oil from the com­pany.</p>
    <p>Five other sim­i­lar charges will be taken into con­sid­er­a­tion dur­ing his sen­tenc­ing.</p>
    <p>Sadagopan re­ceived about US$150,000 from his in­volve­ment in the plot and has not made resti­tu­tion to Shell.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, Deputy Pub­lic Pros­e­cu­tor Christo­pher Ong de­scribed the scheme as “a long-term and large-scale con­spir­acy to mis­ap­pro­pri­ate gas oil from the Shell Pu­lau Bukom man­u­fac­tur­ing site”.</p>
    <p>The court heard that the con­spir­acy took place be­tween 2007 and 2018, dur­ing which gas oil was taken from Shell’s re­fin­ery, the largest petro­chem­i­cal pro­duc­tion and ex­port cen­tre in Asia-Pa­cific.</p>
    <p>Sadagopan was in­volved in the scheme be­tween 2017 and 2018. The to­tal value of gas oil he was in­volved in mis­ap­pro­pri­at­ing is based on the cur­rency con­ver­sion rates at the time of the of­fences.</p>
    <p>He was em­ployed by Shell around 2012 and his du­ties in­cluded man­u­ally open­ing or clos­ing large valves, or op­er­at­ing the black oil con­trol pan­els that dig­i­tally con­trolled the move­ment of valves.</p>
    <p>His ba­sic salary was about $2,400 a month, and $3,400 with shift al­lowances. With over­time work, he was paid about $4,000 monthly.</p>
    <p>He had six co-con­spir­a­tors who</p>
    <p>were em­ployed by Shell Pu­lau Bukom and were part of his work team. They tar­geted ves­sels with Viet­namese and Greek cap­tains to con­duct il­le­gal oil trad­ing.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to one of the co-con­spir­a­tors, Juandi Pun­got, it was well known in the in­dus­try that such peo­ple would read­ily con­duct il­le­gal oil trad­ing.</p>
    <p>They would ap­proach the cap­tains of Viet­namese ves­sels on an ad hoc ba­sis, and ask if they were in­ter­ested in per­form­ing il­le­gal load­ings.</p>
    <p>In mid-2017, Juandi re­cruited Sadagopan into the syn­di­cate.</p>
    <p>He agreed to join partly be­cause he was wor­ried that the more se­nior col­leagues might oth­er­wise treat him with hos­til­ity.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to court doc­u­ments, Sadagopan’s pri­mary role was to open or close the nec­es­sary valves us­ing the black oil panel, as di­rected by his co-con­spir­a­tors.</p>
    <p>Ini­tially, he would be told by the more se­nior ones to move away from the panel that he was op­er­at­ing and let one of them take over con­trol.</p>
    <p>Even­tu­ally, he con­trolled the panel based on the in­struc­tions from the more se­nior co-con­spir­a­tors who told him when to open and shut the valves to avoid de­tec­tion.</p>
    <p>He was of­ten ac­com­pa­nied by a more se­nior per­son as he was less fa­mil­iar with op­er­at­ing the sys­tem.</p>
    <p>The group was able to avoid de­tec­tion for so long through sev­eral mea­sures. For ex­am­ple, they con­fig­ured the flow of mis­ap­pro­pri­ated gas oil through care­fully planned routes and en­sured mul­ti­ple pumps and tanks were mov­ing at the same time, in­clud­ing un­nec­es­sary tank-to-tank trans­fers.</p>
    <p>They also shifted the pro­duc­tion of gas oil into the same tank they took from, and timed the mis­ap­pro­pri­a­tion with the le­git­i­mate load­ing of gas oil so as to not arouse sus­pi­cion.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to court doc­u­ments, Sadagopan did not know who bought the mis­ap­pro­pri­ated gas oil.</p>
    <p>He is sched­uled to be in court for mit­i­ga­tion and sen­tenc­ing on Feb 18. For each charge of crim­i­nal breach of trust, an of­fender can be jailed for up to 15 years and fined.</p>
