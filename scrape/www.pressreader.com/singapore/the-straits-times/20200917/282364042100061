    <p>NEW YORK • Tiger Woods re­turns to the US Open at Winged Foot this week with a score to set­tle against a course he re­gards as one of the three tough­est in the world.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing more than a decade of dom­i­nance be­tween Woods’ first Ma­jor vic­tory in 1997 and his 14th Ma­jor at the 2008 US Open, the for­mer world No. 1 played in 46 con­sec­u­tive Ma­jors.</p>
    <p>That streak of 46 events had only one missed cut – the 2006 US Open at Winged Foot, where he carded back-to-back 76s for a 12-over to­tal.</p>
    <p>Woods, who col­lected the 15th Ma­jor of his ca­reer at last year’s Mas­ters, is pre­par­ing for an­other de­mand­ing as­sign­ment at the par-70 course, play­ing 7,477 yards.</p>
    <p>“It’s up there next to Oak­mont and Carnoustie as far as sheer dif­fi­culty with­out do­ing any­thing to it,” said the three-time US Open cham­pion of the New York course, where the win­ning score has been un­der par just once in the pre­vi­ous four times it has been the host.</p>
    <p>Woods is one of 15 play­ers in the 144-strong field who fea­tured at Winged Foot 14 years ago, but dis­missed sug­ges­tions that ex­pe­ri­ence would pro­vide an edge as the</p>
    <p>“course has changed a lot since then”.</p>
    <p>But the 44-year-old, who scouted Winged Foot ahead of last month’s North­ern Trust in Bos­ton, is con­vinced that the course re­mains as bru­tal as ever.</p>
    <p>“The win­ning scores here have never tra­di­tion­ally been very low. I don’t see that chang­ing this week,” said Woods,</p>
    <p>The Amer­i­can is look­ing for his first top-10 fin­ish since the sport returned in June after be­ing sus­pended for three months due to the</p>
    <p>coro­n­avirus pan­demic.</p>
    <p>His last vic­tory came at the Zozo Cham­pi­onship in Ja­pan last Oc­to­ber when he equalled Sam Snead’s record of 82 PGA Tour wins.</p>
    <p>“The golf course is go­ing to be hard. It de­pends on how dif­fi­cult they want to set up these pins, give us a chance at it.”</p>
    <p>The Amer­i­can is grouped with com­pa­tri­ots and fel­low Ma­jor cham­pi­ons Justin Thomas and Collin Morikawa on the open­ing two days.</p>
    <p>World No. 3 Thomas played two rounds at Winged Foot along­side</p>
    <p>Woods last month and got a taste of the dif­fi­culty lev­els.</p>
    <p>“Tee to green, the rough, the greens, every­thing fac­tored in, I think this is the hard­est course I’ve played,” he said.</p>
    <p>Morikawa con­ceded that he is still try­ing to ac­quaint him­self around Winged Foot but is ea­ger to back up last month’s maiden Ma­jor vic­tory at the PGA Cham­pi­onship.</p>
    <p>“Walk­ing here as a Ma­jor cham­pion, you have a sense of know­ing how to get things done,” said the 23-year-old, whose win at Hard­ing</p>
    <p>Park in San Fran­cisco came in only the sec­ond Ma­jor ap­pear­ance of his fledg­ling pro­fes­sional ca­reer.</p>
    <p>“Yes, I’ve only done it once, but I’ve done it, you just want more,” he said.</p>
    <p>“You get that lit­tle taste of what it’s like, and you know why guys mark in their cal­en­dars the Ma­jor cham­pi­onships for the year.” US OPEN</p>
