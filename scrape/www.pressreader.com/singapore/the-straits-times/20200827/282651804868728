    <p>In an in­ter­view with Bri­tish news­pa­per The In­de­pen­dent to pro­mote her new film Yes, God, Yes, which ex­plores the sex­ual awak­en­ing of a teenager, ac­tress Natalia Dyer (above) spoke out against the sex­u­al­i­sa­tion of young ac­tors.</p>
    <p>The 25-year-old, who plays Nancy Wheeler in Net­flix’s sci­ence-fic­tion hor­ror series Stranger Things (2016 to present), said she feels pro­tec­tive of her teenage cast­mates. The hit show cat­a­pulted its young stars from anonymity to star­dom.</p>
    <p>“No one had any idea how suc­cess­ful the show would be,” she said. “There was no prepa­ra­tion – there couldn’t have been, even if we’d known.”</p>
    <p>Call­ing the series’ suc­cess a “sur­pris­ing and over­whelm­ing shock”, the Amer­i­can ac­tress said it comes with cer­tain down­sides for its young cast, par­tic­u­larly their over­sex­u­al­i­sa­tion.</p>
    <p>“I feel pro­tec­tive over the younger kids even though they’re not kids any­more; they’re teens,” she said. “They’re all great peo­ple and all hav­ing to grow up in very crazy cir­cum­stances.</p>
    <p>On the me­dia at­ten­tion, she noted: “As a pri­vate per­son, I just feel like, leave peo­ple alone – un­less you’re talk­ing about their work or what they want to talk about.”</p>
    <p>She has also found fame chal­leng­ing to nav­i­gate. De­scrib­ing her­self as hav­ing “mouse-like and dis­creet” ten­den­cies, she said: “It’s lovely to meet fans. But it’s very, like, ‘Oh my gosh, I just want to go to the gro­cery store and get some milk. I don’t want to take a photo ev­ery­where I go.’ At first, it was jar­ring. There are fans ev­ery­where. It’s a dif­fi­cult thing to nav­i­gate.”</p>
    <p>Look­ing back on the jour­ney, she added: “It’s been like, five years since we started Stranger Things, and I’ve be­come more con­fi­dent in how I han­dle sit­u­a­tions. At first, I had quite a few bouts of anx­i­ety just as the show was com­ing out be­cause there’s this men­tal­ity of let­ting peo­ple down and not giv­ing enough.”</p>
    <p>Her co-star, Mil­lie Bobby Brown, had also ad­dressed the pres­sures of pub­lic scru­tiny on young peo­ple in an In­sta­gram post on her 16th birth­day in Fe­bru­ary.</p>
    <p>The Bri­tish ac­tress wrote: “There are mo­ments I get frus­trated from the in­ac­cu­racy, in­ap­pro­pri­ate com­ments, sex­u­al­i­sa­tion and un­nec­es­sary in­sults that ul­ti­mately have re­sulted in pain and in­se­cu­rity for me.”</p>
