    <p>Q What was your worst in­vest­ment?</p>
    <p>A I was still in high school and had some sav­ings, which I put into e-com­merce stocks shortly be­fore the tech bub­ble burst around 2000.</p>
    <p>I was about 19 years old then, and lost a bit over US$1,500, which in ab­so­lute terms seems mea­gre but was a large part of my sav­ings at the time.</p>
    <p>My mis­take was not in­cor­rect tim­ing – I don’t be­lieve one can time the mar­ket – but get­ting car­ried away by the eu­pho­ria of an ir­ra­tionally ex­u­ber­ant mar­ket.</p>
    <p>This un­der­lined the need to eval­u­ate in­vest­ments metic­u­lously while be­ing in con­trol of my emo­tional bi­ases.</p>
    <p>Dili­gence in re­search and a steady tem­per­a­ment are cru­cial in­vest­ment qual­i­ties.</p>
    <p>Q And your best in­vest­ment?</p>
    <p>A It was buy­ing a dis­tressed but qual­ity as­set dur­ing the global fi­nan­cial cri­sis be­tween 2008 and 2009.</p>
    <p>I was part of an in­vest­ment team back then that cor­rectly iden­ti­fied early signs of the credit bub­ble and I had raised liq­uid­ity in an­tic­i­pa­tion of the storm ahead.</p>
    <p>Rais­ing liq­uid­ity back then al­lowed me to have am­mu­ni­tion that I was able to use quickly when I saw the op­por­tu­nity.</p>
    <p>Hav­ing no liq­uid­ity when there are plenty of op­por­tu­ni­ties pre­vents you from cap­tur­ing them. It’s like be­ing in front of a de­li­cious buf­fet but not able to touch any­thing.</p>
