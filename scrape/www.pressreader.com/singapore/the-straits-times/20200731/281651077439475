    <p>Air­craft maker Air­bus has re­trenched some of its work­ers in Sin­ga­pore, as Covid-19 travel re­stric­tions in the re­gion have forced planes to be grounded and dented de­mand for avi­a­tion sup­port ser­vices.</p>
    <p>The com­pany told The Straits Times yes­ter­day: “After a thor­ough re­view of our op­er­a­tions, we have had no op­tion but to take dif­fi­cult adap­tive mea­sures, pri­mar­ily af­fect­ing po­si­tions within our cus­tomer ser­vices op­er­a­tion and re­lated sup­port func­tions here.”</p>
    <p>The Euro­pean air­line man­u­fac­turer de­clined to re­veal how many work­ers were re­trenched.</p>
    <p>Air­bus said it is man­ag­ing the process “with re­spect and care for the af­fected em­ploy­ees and pro­vid­ing them with all pos­si­ble as­sis­tance”. This in­cludes work­ing with the Na­tional Trades Union Congress’ Em­ploy­ment and Em­ploy­a­bil­ity In­sti­tute and the As­so­ci­a­tion of Aerospace In­dus­tries (Sin­ga­pore), or AAIS, to help find new job op­por­tu­ni­ties for those af­fected.</p>
    <p>The avi­a­tion in­dus­try has been se­verely dis­rupted by the Covid-19 pan­demic, with global air travel crip­pled by bor­der clo­sures and air­lines scrap­ping plane orders. Aerospace firms, in­clud­ing com­po­nent man­u­fac­tur­ers and main­te­nance fa­cil­i­ties, are slash­ing costs and cut­ting man­power due to de­clin­ing busi­ness.</p>
    <p>Ear­lier this week, air­craft main­te­nance, re­pair and over­haul firm Ea­gle Ser­vices Asia de­cided to let go of over 140 work­ers de­spite im­ple­ment­ing other cost-con­tain­ment mea­sures ear­lier, such as a tem­po­rary salary re­duc­tion and short work week, can­celled merit in­creases, hir­ing freezes and dis­cre­tionary spend­ing cuts. The firm had 829 work­ers be­fore the re­trench­ment.</p>
    <p>It was also re­ported this month that jet en­gine maker Rolls-Royce would be shed­ding some 240 jobs in Sin­ga­pore, or nearly a quar­ter of its lo­cal work­force, as part of a global re­struc­tur­ing. It man­u­fac­tures fan blades and as­sem­bles en­gines at Sele­tar Aerospace Park.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, bud­get car­rier Jet­star Asia has let go of 167 staff, a re­duced num­ber from the ear­lier es­ti­mate of 180, due to new job place­ments and some res­ig­na­tions.</p>
    <p>Mr Sia Kheng Yok, chief ex­ec­u­tive of AAIS, said air­craft man­u­fac­tur­ers and some ma­jor aerospace firms had an­nounced global job cuts rang­ing from 10 per cent to 25 per cent, or be­tween 9,000 and 16,000 jobs. In Sin­ga­pore, govern­ment sup­port has blunted the lo­cal im­pact of these global job cuts, he told The Straits Times.</p>
    <p>Last month, Air­bus un­veiled plans to cut about 15,000 jobs world­wide, say­ing its fu­ture was at stake. As of the end of the first quar­ter, it had some 830 staff in Sin­ga­pore in en­ti­ties span­ning the com­mer­cial air­craft, he­li­copter, de­fence and space busi­nesses. It said: “De­spite the very chal­leng­ing sit­u­a­tion for our in­dus­try, we re­main com­mit­ted to our pres­ence in Sin­ga­pore as our re­gional hub.”</p>
