    <p>While me­di­at­ing a dis­pute be­tween two par­ties in the State Courts, lawyer Ren­gara­joo Ren­gasamy Balasamy no­ticed that one of them re­fused to speak.</p>
    <p>“To make things worse, he did not even want to look at the other party,” said the 76-year-old lawyer.</p>
    <p>Af­ter talk­ing to the dis­putant pri­vately, Mr Ren­gara­joo even­tu­ally made him com­fort­able enough to par­tic­i­pate in the me­di­a­tion ses­sion, and the mat­ter was later re­solved.</p>
    <p>Mr Ren­gara­joo was among 43 vol­un­teers of the Supreme Court, State Courts and Fam­ily Jus­tice Courts who re­ceived awards yes­ter­day for their out­stand­ing com­mit­ment to pro bono work.</p>
    <p>He re­ceived the Out­stand­ing Court Vol­un­teer award in the Ad­vo­cate and So­lic­i­tor cat­e­gory. He also re­ceived the 10-year Long Ser­vice Award.</p>
    <p>Mr Ren­gara­joo, who has been a lit­i­ga­tion l awyer for 34 years, joined the State Courts’ panel of vol­un­teer me­di­a­tors in 2010.</p>
    <p>These me­di­a­tors han­dle cases in the State Courts that have been re­ferred by judges for me­di­a­tion or where par­ties have opted for it.</p>
    <p>Mr Ren­gara­joo, who also han­dles dis­putes at the Sin­ga­pore Me­di­a­tion Cen­tre, said that me­di­at­ing any dis­pute is a chal­lenge.</p>
    <p>This is par­tic­u­larly so when the par­ties have no in­ten­tion of re­solv­ing their dis­agree­ment, and might even be at­tend­ing ses­sions to find out how to strengthen their case.</p>
    <p>Mr Ren­gara­joo has no plans to stop vol­un­teer­ing any time soon.</p>
    <p>“On the con­trary, there is ev­ery rea­son for me to con­tinue as a me­di­a­tor and per­form bet­ter,” he said.</p>
    <p>An­other Out­stand­ing Court Vol­un­teer award re­cip­i­ent, in the Open cat­e­gory, was Mr Indu Ku­mar Va­sude­van, who was the first court vol­un­teer me­di­a­tor to use the e-Me­di­a­tion func­tion in the State Courts’ on­line case fil­ing and man­age­ment sys­tem. He also pro­vided feed­back to im­prove the user ex­pe­ri­ence for e-Me­di­a­tion.</p>
    <p>Polytech­nic stu­dent Jor­dan Lim Zi Rui was an­other award re­cip­i­ent, in the Stu­dent cat­e­gory. He was in­volved in the de­vel­op­ment of an on­line tool which helps par­ties de­ter­mine their el­i­gi­bil­ity to seek re­lief from their con­trac­tual obli­ga­tions un­der the Covid-19 (Tem­po­rary Mea­sures) Act.</p>
    <p>The an­nual ap­pre­ci­a­tion din­ner for all 330 court vol­un­teers was not held this year, ow­ing to the coro­n­avirus sit­u­a­tion.</p>
    <p>In­stead, each vol­un­teer re­ceived cook­ies made by a bak­ery un­der YR In­dus­tries, a sub­sidiary of Yel­low Rib­bon Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>Chief Jus­tice Sun­daresh Menon ex­pressed his ap­pre­ci­a­tion to the court vol­un­teers.</p>
    <p>“Jus­tice, of course, is not con­fined to the tra­di­tional modes of dis­pute res­o­lu­tion. Equally im­por­tant are the peace-build­ing pro­cesses that help foster en­dur­ing restora­tive so­lu­tions,” he said in his mes­sage to the vol­un­teers.</p>
