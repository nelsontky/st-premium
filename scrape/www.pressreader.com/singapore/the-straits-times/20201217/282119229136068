    <p>For decades, they have of­fered cus­tomers a tan­ta­lis­ing glimpse of what life may have in store.</p>
    <p>Now, the for­tune tell­ers of Water­loo Street face a dif­fer­ent fu­ture due to Covid-19 re­stric­tions.</p>
    <p>Two of the 19 who op­er­ate in the area have de­cided not to ap­ply for new li­cences cost­ing $48.15 a month that will be re­quired next year as part of safe dis­tanc­ing mea­sures. Their de­ci­sion was partly down to the fact that they are in their 70s and 80s.</p>
    <p>They are among 41 ven­dors in Water­loo Street who face new li­cens­ing con­di­tions im­posed by the Sin­ga­pore Land Au­thor­ity (SLA), which wants them to start work­ing in des­ig­nated lots.</p>
    <p>At present, the ven­dors are al­lowed to choose where to op­er­ate in the pedes­tri­anised mall in front of the Kwan Im Thong Hood Cho Tem­ple and Sri Kr­ish­nan Tem­ple.</p>
    <p>A bal­lot­ing ex­er­cise to al­lo­cate the lots on Mon­day was at­tended by the re­main­ing 39 ven­dors.</p>
    <p>The street en­hance­ment ex­er­cise re­quires ven­dors to ob­tain a tem­po­rary oc­cu­pa­tion li­cence. They will pro­gres­sively move into the 2m by 1.5m lots from Jan 4 next year, and the fee will be payable from June 1.</p>
    <p>The SLA said that ven­dors who face fi­nan­cial dif­fi­cul­ties can ap­proach it for as­sis­tance.</p>
    <p>Be­sides the for­tune tell­ers, there are 19 flower ven­dors, two re­flex­ol­o­gists and one cob­bler cur­rently ply­ing their trades from makeshift stalls.</p>
    <p>The SLA said the changes would al­low safe dis­tanc­ing be­tween the ven­dors, give fire en­gines clear ac­cess to the area and pro­vide more room for pedes­tri­ans.</p>
    <p>At the mo­ment, the of­ten-busy mall is filled with makeshift stalls and dis­carded boxes that ob­struct the path­ways.</p>
    <p>“These are not con­ducive to both the street ven­dors and vis­i­tors to the area, and are po­ten­tial fire haz­ards,” said the au­thor­ity in a joint state­ment with the Sin­ga­pore Food Agency and Ur­ban Re­de­vel­op­ment Au­thor­ity on Dec 8.</p>
    <p>En­hance­ment works to draw up the lots will be car­ried out in phases.</p>
    <p>“To com­ply with the req­ui­site buf­fer for fire safety and safe dis­tanc­ing be­tween the stalls, cou­pled with the lim­ited space along Water­loo Mall, we are un­able to ex­pand the size of the lot or place all ven­dors along Water­loo Mall,” said the SLA.</p>
