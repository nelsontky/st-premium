    <p>In­dia is plan­ning to share doses of Covid-19 vac­cines with its smaller neigh­bours, in a move that is ex­pected to for­tify its in­flu­ence in the re­gion. But as the coun­try that has a rep­u­ta­tion of be­ing the world’s phar­macy be­gins to in­oc­u­late its own pop­u­la­tion, it has to bal­ance its diplo­macy goals with its im­mense do­mes­tic needs.</p>
    <p>Nir­mala Gana­p­a­thy In­dia Bureau Chief In New Delhi</p>
    <p>In­dia is plan­ning to share its doses of the Covid-19 vac­cine with its smaller neigh­bours, a move ex­pected to for­tify its in­flu­ence in the neigh­bour­hood.</p>
    <p>Sources said dis­cus­sions are on­go­ing within the gov­ern­ment on the num­ber of doses to be shared and whether the cost should be con­sid­ered as a grant. The doses are likely to be made avail­able as early as the end of this month.</p>
    <p>In­dia is due to begin vac­ci­nat­ing its own cit­i­zens on Satur­day.</p>
    <p>“The num­ber of doses and the modal­i­ties are be­ing worked out,” said a source who de­clined to be iden­ti­fied.</p>
    <p>The plan is to dispatch an ini­tial batch as a spe­cial ges­ture to un­der­line that the neigh­bour­hood is In­dia’s pri­or­ity, a pol­icy re­peat­edly high­lighted by the lead­er­ship in New Delhi dur­ing the pan­demic. Bangladesh, Nepal and Bhutan are among the neigh­bours set to ben­e­fit from the move.</p>
    <p>The Serum In­sti­tute of In­dia (SII) is the world’s big­gest man­u­fac­turer of vac­cines, and the coun­try is ex­pected to play a key role in the sup­ply of Covid-19 vac­cines to lowand mid­dle-in­come coun­tries.</p>
    <p>The gov­ern­ment has been em­bark­ing on vac­cine diplo­macy for some months. In Novem­ber, For­eign Sec­re­tary Harsh Vard­han Shringla promised Nepal that its needs would be a pri­or­ity for In­dia. Nepal is re­port­edly seek­ing 12 mil­lion doses, which is ex­pected to come up in dis­cus­sions dur­ing For­eign Min­is­ter Pradeep Gyawali’s visit to In­dia this week.</p>
    <p>Prime Min­is­ter Naren­dra Modi sim­i­larly as­sured his Bangladesh­i coun­ter­part Sheikh Hasina in Oc­to­ber that In­dia would take spe­cial note of the coun­try’s needs.</p>
    <p>Bangladesh has also signed a deal with SII to buy 30 mil­lion doses.</p>
    <p>Other neigh­bours like Myan­mar have been in dis­cus­sions with New Delhi, while Bhutan’s Am­bas­sador to In­dia Vet­sop Nam­gyel has said that vac­cines pro­duced in In­dia would be the eas­i­est to trans­port.</p>
    <p>An­a­lysts note that In­dia’s soft power diplo­macy will co­in­cide with the South Asian coun­try tak­ing a seat at the United Na­tions Se­cu­rity Coun­cil this month.</p>
    <p>“I think it is the hu­man an­gle of In­dian diplo­macy which will be at play over here. What will be at play is the In­dian ca­pac­ity to de­velop (indige­nous vac­cines) and pro­duce. Both are im­por­tant,” said Mr Gur­jit Singh, a for­mer In­dian am­bas­sador to Asean and In­done­sia.</p>
    <p>“Neigh­bour­ing coun­tries – other than Pak­istan – will be the first likely ben­e­fi­cia­ries (of In­dia-pro­duced vac­cines)... In the sec­ond stage, it will likely be African coun­tries,” he added.</p>
    <p>In­dia ap­proved two vac­cines for emer­gency use this month. One was de­vel­oped by As­traZeneca and Ox­ford Univer­sity and is be­ing man­u­fac­tured lo­cally by the SII.</p>
    <p>The other is an in­dige­nously pro­duced one, called Co­vaxin, by lo­cal firm Bharat Biotech in col­lab­o­ra­tion with the In­dian Coun­cil of Med­i­cal Re­search’s Na­tional In­sti­tute of Vi­rol­ogy.</p>
    <p>In­dia, the world’s third-largest pro­ducer of drugs, has built up a rep­u­ta­tion as the phar­macy of the world, sup­ply­ing high-qual­ity and low-cost medicines for a va­ri­ety of diseases.</p>
    <p>It sup­plies 50 per cent to 60 per cent of the world’s many vac­cines, in­clud­ing af­ford­able anti-retro­vi­ral drugs, 40 per cent of gener­ics con­sumed in the United States and 25 per cent of all the medicines dis­pensed in Bri­tain, ac­cord­ing to the Fed­er­a­tion of In­dian Cham­bers of Com­merce and In­dus­try.</p>
    <p>But In­dia’s do­mes­tic needs are im­mense for Covid-19 vac­cines be­cause it is the world’s sec­ond-worst af­fected coun­try, with more than 10.4 mil­lion cases.</p>
    <p>In the first phase of its vac­ci­na­tion pro­gramme, it is look­ing at in­oc­u­lat­ing 300 mil­lion peo­ple. What pol­i­cy­mak­ers are grap­pling with is the amount In­dia can spare for its neigh­bours, keep­ing in mind do­mes­tic re­quire­ments.</p>
    <p>King’s Col­lege Lon­don pro­fes­sor Harsh V. Pant, who is di­rec­tor of stud­ies at the Ob­server Re­search Foun­da­tion in New Delhi, said: “At the end of the day, it’s a ca­pac­ity prob­lem. How much In­dia can do when its own in­ter­nal re­quire­ments are quite high.</p>
    <p>“They have to fig­ure that out so that crit­i­cal coun­tries are not sidelined even as do­mes­tic con­sump­tion re­mains very strong. So I think those chal­lenges are more lo­gis­ti­cal.”</p>
    <p>But he also noted that In­dia had taken a lead­er­ship role early on, such as in dis­tribut­ing med­i­cal sup­plies like pro­tec­tive equip­ment to the neigh­bour­hood and be­yond.</p>
    <p>He said: “Since the pan­demic started, you would have seen how In­dia has been try­ing to lever­age its role as the phar­macy of the world. This has been re­peat­edly em­pha­sised by the Prime Min­is­ter, For­eign Min­is­ter and other min­is­ters – that In­dia is a re­spon­si­ble stake­holder and provider in global public health. In that sense, this is an im­por­tant op­por­tu­nity for In­dia.”</p>
    <p>China, which has faced flak for a lack of trans­parency, has also of­fered its home­made vac­cines in South Asia in the ini­tial stages of the pan­demic. Pak­istan has an­nounced that it will buy 1.2 mil­lion doses from China’s Sinopharm.</p>
    <p>“In the neigh­bour­hood, it (vac­cine diplo­macy) would be a piv­otal part of diplo­matic en­gage­ment,” said Pro­fes­sor Pant.</p>
    <p>“This is an area where In­dia is a strong player and it would like to lever­age it in its re­la­tion­ships. Coun­tries like Bangladesh and Nepal would be ben­e­fi­cia­ries.”</p>
