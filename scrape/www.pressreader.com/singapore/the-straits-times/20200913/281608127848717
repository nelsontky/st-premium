    <p>NEW DELHI/SHANG­HAI • Five In­dian na­tion­als from a re­mote east­ern state who had been de­tained by the Chi­nese au­thor­i­ties in a re­gion bor­der­ing Ti­bet have been handed over to the In­dian au­thor­i­ties, the In­dian army said.</p>
    <p>“(The) in­di­vid­u­als will now be quar­an­tined for 14 days as per Covid-19 pro­to­col and will there­after be handed over to their fam­ily mem­bers,” Lieu­tenant-Colonel Harsh Ward­han Pande, a spokesman for the In­dian army, said in a state­ment yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>He said the five youths had “in­ad­ver­tently strayed” across the de facto bor­der while for­ag­ing and hunt­ing, adding that two other such in­ci­dents had taken place this year in In­dia’s Arunachal Pradesh state, which bor­ders China.</p>
    <p>How­ever, a Chi­nese state-backed tabloid said the five were In­dian in­tel­li­gence agents dressed as hunters, dis­put­ing claims that they had been kid­napped.</p>
    <p>Bi­lat­eral re­la­tions have been unusu­ally tense since a clash at a dis­puted bor­der area in June that killed 20 In­dian sol­diers, with an un­known num­ber of Chi­nese ca­su­al­ties.</p>
    <p>Last Tues­day, fol­low­ing re­ports that five In­di­ans from the state of Arunachal Pradesh had gone miss­ing, an In­dian min­is­ter said the Chi­nese Peo­ple’s Lib­er­a­tion Army con­firmed they had been found in China.</p>
    <p>Their dis­ap­pear­ance co­in­cided with a bor­der con­fronta­tion that week in the west­ern Hi­malayas, dur­ing which both ac­cused the other of fir­ing in the air.</p>
    <p>The two sides have long ob­served a pro­to­col avoid­ing the use of firearms in the un­de­mar­cated fron­tier, though vi­o­lence has erupted in the past.</p>
    <p>Last Thurs­day, Chi­nese State Coun­cil­lor Wang Yi and In­dian For­eign Min­is­ter S. Jais­hankar met in Moscow and agreed to de-es­ca­late the bor­der ten­sions.</p>
