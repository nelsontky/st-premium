    <p>WASHINGTON • A clear ma­jor­ity of vot­ers in the United States be­lieve the win­ner of the pres­i­den­tial elec­tion should fill the Supreme Court seat left open by the death of Jus­tice Ruth Bader Gins­burg, ac­cord­ing to a poll con­ducted by The New York Times and Siena Col­lege.</p>
    <p>In a sur­vey of likely vot­ers taken in the week l ead­ing up to Mr Trump’s nom­i­na­tion last Satur­day of Judge Amy Coney Bar­rett to the High Court, 56 per cent said they pre­ferred to have the elec­tion act as a sort of ref­er­en­dum on the va­cancy.</p>
    <p>Only 41 per cent said they wanted Mr Trump to choose a jus­tice be­fore Novem­ber.</p>
    <p>More strik­ingly, the vot­ers that Mr Trump and en­dan­gered Se­nate Repub­li­cans must re­claim to close the gap in the polls are even more op­posed to a hasty pick: 62 per cent of women, 63 per cent of in­de­pen­dents and 60 per cent of col­lege-ed­u­cated white vot­ers said they wanted the win­ner of the cam­paign to ap­point the next jus­tice.</p>
    <p>The warn­ing signs for Repub­li­cans are also stark on the is­sue of abor­tion, on which Mrs Bar­rett, a fiercely con­ser­va­tive ju­rist, could of­fer a piv­otal vote should she be con­firmed: 60 per cent of those sur­veyed be­lieve abor­tion should be le­gal all or some of the time.</p>
    <p>The poll sug­gests Mr Trump would reap lit­tle po­lit­i­cal ben­e­fit from a clash over abor­tion rights: 56 per cent said they would be less likely to vote for him if his jus­tice would help over­turn the abor­tion vote, while just 24 per cent said they would be more in­clined to vote for him.</p>
    <p>The sur­vey also in­di­cates that Mr Trump has not es­tab­lished a clear up­per hand over his Demo­cratic ri­val Joe Bi­den on any of the most im­por­tant is­sues of the cam­paign.</p>
    <p>The poll had a mar­gin of sam­pling er­ror of 3.5 per­cent­age points.</p>
    <p>Judge Gins­burg’s death has jolted Washington just weeks be­fore the elec­tion, herald­ing the pos­si­bil­ity of an en­dur­ing con­ser­va­tive ma­jor­ity on the Supreme Court.</p>
    <p>Mr Bi­den and fel­low Democrats made it clear on Sun­day that their op­po­si­tion to Mr Trump’s Supreme Court pick would fo­cus on the pos­si­bil­ity that Mrs Bar­rett could cast a de­ci­sive vote to strike down the Oba­macare health law.</p>
    <p>With Repub­li­cans con­trol­ling the Se­nate, Democrats have lit­tle lever­age to stop a quick vote on Mrs Bar­rett be­fore the elec­tion and al­most no hope of pre­vent­ing her con­fir­ma­tion.</p>
    <p>Mrs Bar­rett could be on the court’s bench for oral ar­gu­ments on Nov 10, in a case in which Mr Trump and his Repub­li­can al­lies are seek­ing to in­val­i­date the Af­ford­able Care Act – the 2010 law pop­u­larly known Oba­macare. That could cost mil­lions of Amer­i­cans their health­care cov­er­age.</p>
    <p>Mr Bi­den said: “The clear fo­cus is: This is about your health­care... This is about whether or not pre-ex­ist­ing con­di­tions will con­tinue to be cov­ered. This is about whether or not a woman can be charged more for the same pro­ce­dure as a man. This is about peo­ple’s health­care in the mid­dle of a pan­demic.”</p>
