    <p>A new book of es­says chron­i­cling Singapore’s bi­cen­ten­nial jour­ney and the role of the Malay/Mus­lim com­mu­nity i n its his­tory was launched yesterday.</p>
    <p>Be­yond Bi­cen­ten­nial: Per­spec­tives On Malays is a col­lec­tion of 45 es­says pub­lished by thought lead­ers and aca­demics on topics dat­ing back to more than 700 years ago when Sang Nila Utama first set foot on Singapore.</p>
    <p>It was edited by for­mer se­nior min­is­ter of state for for­eign af­fairs Zainul Abidin Rasheed, for­mer MP Wan Hussin Zoohri and ISEAS – Yu­sof Ishak In­sti­tute se­nior fel­low Nor­shahril Saat.</p>
    <p>In a me­dia re­lease about the book, pub­lisher World Sci­en­tific Pub­lish­ing said that while the book’s ob­jec­tive is to doc­u­ment the dif­fer­ent views on Malays, it is not a book for only the Malay/Mus­lim com­mu­nity and it calls on read­ers to re­flect on the con­tri­bu­tions of Malays to Singapore’s devel­op­ment.</p>
    <p>“Be­yond Bi­cen­ten­nial is for all Sin­ga­pore­ans. It pro­vides an op­por­tu­nity to ex­plore how the past of one com­mu­nity has also shaped all of us, and how each of us and our mul­tira­cial and multi-re­li­gious com­mu­ni­ties are con­nected and in­ter­twined with one an­other,” said the re­lease.</p>
    <p>“It highlights some of the key val­ues that have held well for our fore­fa­thers, val­ues that will con­tinue to be im­por­tant to cur­rent and fu­ture gen­er­a­tions of Singapore.”</p>
    <p>Speak­ing at the book launch held at the Malay Her­itage Cen­tre yesterday, Ed­u­ca­tion Min­is­ter Lawrence Wong, who was guest of hon­our, said Singapore’s his­tory is closely in­ter­twined with Malay cul­ture, and noted that be­fore the Bri­tish ar­rived in 1819, the is­land was part of the Malay world, com­pris­ing the Riau Is­lands and Jo­hor.</p>
    <p>The book plays an im­por­tant role in telling the unique stories of the Malay com­mu­nity here, said Mr Wong, point­ing out that the com­mu­nity’s val­ues have helped shaped the fab­ric of Singapore’s mul­ti­cul­tural so­ci­ety.</p>
    <p>“The go­tong roy­ong spirit has helped us to strengthen care and trust in our so­ci­ety. Fam­i­lies re­lied on this com­mu­nity spirit to weather hard­ships dur­ing the colo­nial pe­riod and through the Ja­panese Oc­cu­pa­tion,” he said.</p>
    <p>This spirit of fos­ter­ing a sense of to­geth­er­ness and com­mu­nity re­mains rel­e­vant to­day amid the Covid-19 pan­demic, added Mr Wong, who co-chairs the min­is­te­rial task force tack­ling Covid-19.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker pe­riod ear­lier this year to stem the spread of the dis­ease, the Malay com­mu­nity sup­ported dif­fi­cult de­ci­sions such as the clos­ing of mosques, and worked to­gether to raise funds and de­liver food to the needy dur­ing the fast­ing month.</p>
    <p>The book re­tails for $37 (pa­per­back) and $96 (hardcover) at ma­jor book­stores and dis­trib­u­tors, as well as on­line. Its con­trib­u­tors in­clude Am­bas­sador-at-Large Tommy Koh, for­mer Men­daki chief ex­ec­u­tive Ra­hayu Buang and Singapore Man­age­ment Univer­sity’s As­so­ciate Pro­fes­sor Eu­gene Tan.</p>
    <p>Mr Zainul said the three ed­i­tors spent about two years work­ing on Be­yond Bi­cen­ten­nial. He hopes read­ers will take in dif­fer­ent view­points about the role Malays have played in Singapore’s jour­ney.</p>
    <p>“What makes this book dif­fer­ent is it cap­tures per­spec­tives on Malays, rather than pro­vid­ing a Malay per­spec­tive. Read­ers can get opin­ions from non-Malay con­trib­u­tors as well,” said Mr Zainul.</p>
    <p>“It gives the book mul­ti­ple, but bal­anced, per­spec­tives on the Malays held by both Malay and non-Malay con­trib­u­tors.”</p>
