    <p>Calls to ex­tend and en­hance schemes to help peo­ple who fall through the cracks were made by sev­eral MPs on the first day of de­bate on the Pres­i­dent’s Ad­dress.</p>
    <p>Mr Seah Kian Peng (Ma­rine Pa­rade GRC) called for greater dis­cre­tion in as­sess­ing those who ap­ply for help, as he shared an anec­dote about a res­i­dent and her el­derly hus­band.</p>
    <p>To qual­ify for a sub­sidised rate at a nurs­ing home, a se­nior must be liv­ing alone and not have any fam­ily or care­giver, noted Mr Seah, adding this meant the res­i­dent would not qual­ify if she ap­plied to ad­mit him.</p>
    <p>But she had no choice, as she had a bad fall and earns only about $1,200 a month, which meant she did not have the abil­ity or the money to care for him, the MP said.</p>
    <p>Mr Seah sug­gested that govern­ment agen­cies con­sult vol­un­teers and so­cial work­ers who deal with such cases, so that res­i­dents who slip through the cracks get the help they need quickly. He also said of­fi­cers in th­ese agen­cies should be given more flex­i­bil­ity.</p>
    <p>“I ask for civil ser­vants and of­fi­cers in statu­tory boards to be given more au­thor­ity to ex­er­cise dis­cre­tion,” he said.</p>
    <p>Sim­i­larly, Mr Don Wee (Chua Chu Kang GRC) asked the Govern­ment to dis­card rigid­ity in pol­i­cy­mak­ing so that the con­cerns of dif­fer­ent groups of Sin­ga­pore­ans can be con­sid­ered.</p>
    <p>The new MP noted in his maiden speech that the bot­tom rung of blue-col­lar house­holds have dif­fi­culty mak­ing ba­sic ends meet, while the sand­wiched class have lower dis­cre­tionary sav­ings and there­fore may be vul­ner­a­ble to “ad hoc oc­cur­rences” of un­em­ploy­ment and ill­nesses.</p>
    <p>Th­ese sce­nar­ios im­pede so­cial mo­bil­ity, he added, call­ing for more in­clu­sive pol­icy de­sign.</p>
    <p>Ms Foo Mee Har (West Coast GRC) ad­vo­cated a more pro­gres­sive per­sonal in­come tax sys­tem which could in­clude wealth taxes, so as to build a fairer and more equal so­ci­ety.</p>
    <p>Ms Foo, who is chief ex­ec­u­tive of the Wealth Man­age­ment In­sti­tute</p>
    <p>EM­POWER THEM</p>
    <p>I ask for civil ser­vants and of­fi­cers in statu­tory boards to be given more au­thor­ity to ex­er­cise dis­cre­tion. ’’</p>
    <p>MR SEAH KIAN PENG, MP for Ma­rine Pa­rade GRC, call­ing for govern­ment agen­cies to con­sult vol­un­teers and so­cial work­ers, so that res­i­dents who slip through the cracks can get the help they need quickly.</p>
    <p>at Nanyang Tech­no­log­i­cal Univer­sity, noted that in the past, the re­luc­tance to im­pose such taxes was driven by a fear of scar­ing away wealthy in­vestors.</p>
    <p>But Sin­ga­pore’s sta­bil­ity and world-class in­fra­struc­ture con­tinue to make it at­trac­tive to the wealthy, es­pe­cially in a world made more tur­bu­lent and un­cer­tain by Covid-19, she added. “As a des­ti­na­tion for global wealth as­sets, Sin­ga­pore of­fers peace of mind and will con­tinue to be at­trac­tive, even if our well-struc­tured tax regime im­poses higher rates,” said Ms Foo.</p>
    <p>Mr Pri­tam Singh (Alju­nied GRC) also called for greater help for those who need it most, even if this meant that some here would have to pay higher taxes.</p>
    <p>In Scan­di­navia, many are con­tent to pay higher taxes be­cause they know this means that oth­ers in their so­ci­ety will be able to live with greater dig­nity, he said.</p>
