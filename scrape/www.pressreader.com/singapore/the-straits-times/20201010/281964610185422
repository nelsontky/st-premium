    <p>The Covid-19 pan­demic has touched al­most ev­ery as­pect of daily life, with men­tal health is­sues faced by all age groups. It is also the first ma­jor cri­sis for many youth, who are deal­ing with stress over find­ing a job in a dis­mal econ­omy and sup­port­ing their friends, while tack­ling their own men­tal health con­cerns. Ahead of World Men­tal Health Day to­day, Rachel Quek spoke to two young peo­ple to see how the pan­demic has af­fected their men­tal health, and how they are cop­ing.</p>
    <p>When Mr Ni­co­las Kang and oth­ers in his co­hort were sud­denly asked to va­cate their rooms at YaleNUS Col­lege (YNC) in April, his men­tal health took an­other hit.</p>
    <p>With his father re­trenched and his grad­u­a­tion sched­uled in a month, Mr Kang, 25, was al­ready suf­fer­ing from anx­i­ety over his fam­ily’s fi­nances and his own em­ploy­ment op­por­tu­ni­ties, both af­fected by the fall­out from Covid-19.</p>
    <p>Last year, Mr Kang was con­stantly lethargic and un­able to fo­cus in school. When he had men­tal break­downs, his par­ents would dis­miss his be­hav­iour as at­ten­tion-seek­ing.</p>
    <p>Mr Kang then con­fided in his sis­ter. “My older sis­ter is more well versed in men­tal health is­sues.</p>
    <p>When I started talk­ing to her about it, she was will­ing to fi­nan­cially sup­port me so I could get ther­apy.”</p>
    <p>He vis­ited YNC Coun­selling Cen­tre, and was pre­scribed the anti-anx­i­ety med­i­ca­tion Xanax.</p>
    <p>The peak of his symp­toms resur­faced a year later, dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker pe­riod. “I was un­able to func­tion dur­ing the day, and I would get tired while do­ing my work half­way.”</p>
    <p>He reached out to a coun­sel­lor at the In­sti­tute of Men­tal Health, and had vir­tual ses­sions at a sub­sidised rate of $45 per ses­sion.</p>
    <p>“For me, coun­selling is like an es­sen­tial bill I have to pay for my health,” he said.</p>
    <p>Now, he feels a re­spon­si­bil­ity to share his ex­pe­ri­ence through art and so­cial me­dia. For his un­der­grad­u­ate the­sis, Mr Kang, an arts and hu­man­i­ties ma­jor, de­signed a nar­ra­tive choice game that pro­motes ac­tive lis­ten­ing. He is now a mar­ket­ing trainee at In­finit Care, which pro­motes men­tal well­ness pro­grammes for com­pa­nies.</p>
    <p>He also reg­u­larly posts men­tal health ar­ti­cles on Face­book to help build aware­ness among his peers.</p>
    <p>“The more I am open about it, the more I can try to nor­malise these kind of con­ver­sa­tions.”</p>
    <p>Ms Char­lotte Wang, who has more than 9,000 fol­low­ers on In­sta­gram, is among those driv­ing in­flu­encer mar­ket­ing in Sin­ga­pore, re­view­ing fash­ion and life­style prod­ucts on so­cial me­dia. She pre­vi­ously pur­sued such con­tent cre­ation as a side hus­tle when she had a full-time job.</p>
    <p>But in March, she quit her cor­po­rate job in mar­ket­ing to take a short break from full-time work. What was meant to be a brief va­ca­tion be­came a long and uncer­tain jour­ney when com­pa­nies started to freeze hir­ing be­cause of the Covid-19 out­break.</p>
    <p>“There were some nights when I was just cry­ing af­ter ev­ery­one went to sleep. I would lie in bed awake un­til about four in the morn­ing just wait­ing for my­self to tire out,” said the 27-year-old.</p>
    <p>Ms Wang had her first ex­pe­ri­ence with de­pres­sion in 2017 af­ter break­ing up with a long-time part­ner. Dur­ing the re­cent cir­cuit breaker, when she again started show­ing signs of de­pres­sion, her par­ents were wor­ried, but gave her the space to bounce back.</p>
    <p>She said: “My par­ents are very tra­di­tional, so they don’t re­ally be­lieve in men­tal health is­sues. But af­ter see­ing what I have been through and read­ing more about it, they just let me feel the emo­tions I was ex­pe­ri­enc­ing.</p>
    <p>“Once I was able to spot my de­pres­sion tak­ing over, I knew what steps to take. It was not easy even the sec­ond time around. But just slowly get­ting out of bed, brush­ing your teeth, mak­ing your­self a nice meal – all these small things helped me get through the day.”</p>
    <p>Ms Wang, who is can­did on In­sta­gram about her ex­pe­ri­ence with de­pres­sion and anx­i­ety, reg­u­larly shares posts on men­tal health is­sues and pub­licly an­swers ques­tions about her cop­ing strate­gies, to sup­port oth­ers. “I think a lot of times we think that we are alone, but that is not true at all. Things may not al­ways be 10/10, but we can get through life to­gether.”</p>
