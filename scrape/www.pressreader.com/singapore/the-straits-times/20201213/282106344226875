    <p>SYDNEY • In Fe­bru­ary, as Aus­tralia’s bush fire-rav­aged sum­mer ended, Mr Richard Beach and his wife Jenny, the own­ers of a guest­house and art gallery in the tiny town of Millthorpe, west of Sydney, were hop­ing for a fresh start and a re­turn of the tourist trade.</p>
    <p>They and the town’s other 1,251 res­i­dents had en­dured a hor­rific drought, fol­lowed by the worst bush fires on record. But then the Covid-19 pan­demic struck.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing a two-week pe­riod in March, Mr Beach re­called, the guest­house, called Rose­bank, lost six months’ worth of book­ings. Their ac­com­mo­da­tion went empty as the pic­turesque town – known for its her­itage build­ings and its award-win­ning restau­rant – be­came a ghost town.</p>
    <p>But then, in June, the au­thor­i­ties an­nounced that travel and busi­ness curbs im­posed to con­tain the coro­n­avirus would be lifted.</p>
    <p>Im­me­di­ately, Mr Beach said, the phone at Rose­bank be­gan to ring. It has not stopped ring­ing. The guest­house has just recorded its busiest six months since he and his wife opened it eight years ago.</p>
    <p>“There are five mil­lion peo­ple liv­ing within a half-day drive and they can’t go over­seas – and back then they still couldn’t go in­ter­state,” he said. “They got rest­less and so they started to drive out here. We went from noth­ing to ev­ery­thing.”</p>
    <p>The in­flux was not lim­ited to Rose­bank. Across Millthorpe, which is about 250km or a 3½-hour drive from Sydney, ac­com­mo­da­tion and cafes quickly filled up and shops ex­tended their open­ing hours.</p>
    <p>For the first time that any­one could re­mem­ber, it has some­times been im­pos­si­ble to find a park­ing space along the main road.</p>
    <p>“It is a great feel­ing for the town,” Mr Beach, 58, said. “A lot of the vis­i­tors who are com­ing to the town have never been out here be­fore. It is a whole new thing for them. We are hope­ful that this ex­tra de­mand in vis­i­ta­tion might hang on. It is a newly dis­cov­ered re­gion for them.”</p>
    <p>The ex­pe­ri­ence of Millthorpe has been play­ing out across Aus­tralia, where typ­i­cally quiet re­gional ar­eas have been en­joy­ing a surge in vis­i­tors.</p>
    <p>Aus­tralia is a vast sparsely-pop­u­lated con­ti­nent whose 25 mil­lion res­i­dents live mostly in a hand­ful of big coastal cities. Yet the coun­try is scat­tered with small towns, which of­ten date back to the 19th cen­tury but have strug­gled as farms con­sol­i­dated and younger res­i­dents moved to cities for em­ploy­ment and study op­por­tu­ni­ties.</p>
    <p>In re­cent years, many of these towns have been try­ing to draw vis­i­tors. Some ar­eas have started an­nual fes­ti­vals or pro­moted wine­mak­ing and turned them­selves – as Millthorpe has – into des­ti­na­tions that of­fer ac­cess to cel­lar tours and fine din­ing.</p>
    <p>Still, it has not been easy for these small towns to stand out on the des­ti­na­tion map of city dwellers who could eas­ily hop on a plane and land at a fes­ti­val or win­ery over­seas.</p>
    <p>But that has changed since the coro­n­avirus pan­demic struck.</p>
    <p>Aus­tralia has largely suc­ceeded in com­bat­ing its Covid-19 out­breaks. But in­ter­na­tional tourists are still barred from com­ing, and many states have un­til re­cently closed their bor­ders to the big­gest cities of Sydney and Mel­bourne be­cause of their in­fec­tion rates.</p>
    <p>So, many Aus­tralians, des­per­ate for a break from the monotony of lock­downs, have hopped into their cars and be­gun driv­ing to far­away places that they had never pre­vi­ously con­sid­ered vis­it­ing.</p>
    <p>In Septem­ber, Perth res­i­dent Han­nah Docherty re­counted how she was forced to can­cel a trip to Europe due to the pan­demic. In­stead, she went on a road trip, driv­ing sev­eral thou­sand kilo­me­tres to the re­mote north­ern part of Western Aus­tralia.</p>
    <p>“Af­ter the lock­down, I was so des­per­ate to get out of the city and ex­plore a bit of the state while we had the op­por­tu­nity,” the 25-year-old told ABC News.</p>
    <p>“Ev­ery­one’s do­ing the same thing, I think. I guess, I just never got round to it be­cause we were trav­el­ling in­ter­na­tion­ally.”</p>
    <p>The phe­nom­e­non has been a wel­come gift for re­mote towns, which have of­ten strug­gled to at­tract vis­i­tors. For­eign vis­i­tors, in par­tic­u­lar, tend to visit ma­jor cities or well-known at­trac­tions like the Great Bar­rier Reef, but are less likely to ven­ture to far-flung re­gional des­ti­na­tions.</p>
    <p>Putting aside vis­its to the reef and the Gold Coast, the top 10 places vis­ited by in­ter­na­tional tourists last year in­cluded just two in re­gional Aus­tralia – north­ern New South Wales and the Sun­shine Coast in Queens­land, ac­cord­ing to Tourism Aus­tralia.</p>
    <p>But the re­stric­tions on in­ter­na­tional travel mean that tourism in Aus­tralia is now de­pen­dent on do­mes­tic trav­ellers. While the tourism sec­tor has strug­gled through­out the pan­demic, re­gional ar­eas have per­formed bet­ter than cap­i­tal cities.</p>
    <p>In Au­gust, for in­stance, spend­ing by vis­i­tors to Sydney, cap­i­tal of New South Wales, fell 85 per cent, against a drop of 28 per cent in re­gional ar­eas of the state. The re­mote out­back re­gion of New South Wales had 214,000 in­ter­state vis­i­tors in the year to June, up 14 per cent from the pre­vi­ous year. Across the state, pop­u­lar tourism ar­eas recorded spikes in vis­i­tor num­bers dur­ing the mid-year school hol­i­days.</p>
    <p>New South Wales Min­is­ter for Tourism Stu­art Ayres said do­mes­tic trav­ellers have been flock­ing to re­gional ar­eas and many ac­com­mo­da­tion providers are booked up to early next year.</p>
    <p>“It has been fan­tas­tic to see do­mes­tic trav­ellers em­brace our spec­tac­u­lar NSW back­yard from city to coun­try to coast while some bor­der re­stric­tions have been in place,” Mr Ayres told The Sun­day Times.</p>
    <p>“It has cre­ated a huge op­por­tu­nity for re­gional com­mu­ni­ties to ben­e­fit from the hol­i­day­mak­ers, road trip­pers and peo­ple vis­it­ing fam­ily and friends who stay and spend lo­cally dur­ing their trav­els.”</p>
    <p>He added: “When peo­ple take a road trip they usu­ally travel far­ther, stay longer and stop in more towns along the way, spread­ing the ben­e­fit among even more com­mu­ni­ties.”</p>
    <p>Tourism is one of Aus­tralia’s largest ex­ports. Last year, the in­dus­try gen­er­ated A$122 bil­lion (S$123 bil­lion) in do­mes­tic and in­ter­na­tional spend­ing in Aus­tralia and ac­counted for 660,000 jobs or 5 per cent of the work­force.</p>
    <p>State and fed­eral gov­ern­ments as well as the tourism au­thor­i­ties have been en­cour­ag­ing Aus­tralians to con­sider mak­ing do­mes­tic trips to sup­port the hard-hit tourism in­dus­try.</p>
    <p>A new Tourism Aus­tralia ad­ver­tis­ing cam­paign en­cour­ages peo­ple to give va­ca­tion vouch­ers as gifts dur­ing the Christ­mas hol­i­days.</p>
    <p>Fed­eral Tourism Min­is­ter Si­mon Birm­ing­ham said on Dec 4: “Aus­tralia is lucky enough to be home to some of the most unique and won­der­ful ex­pe­ri­ences, but with many of our top at­trac­tions most pop­u­lar with in­ter­na­tional vis­i­tors, we need Aus­tralians to help fill the void un­til our in­ter­na­tional bor­ders re-open again.”</p>
    <p>In Millthorpe, Mr Beach said the town still faced a chal­lenge over the com­ing sum­mer hol­i­days in en­tic­ing vis­i­tors to the area, which is in­land and far from the coun­try’s fa­mous beaches. But he said many re­cent vis­i­tors had been keen to sup­port re­gional Aus­tralia’s sur­vival – and he hoped they will keep do­ing so when the pan­demic fi­nally ends.</p>
    <p>“Peo­ple tell us they want to spend a dol­lar in the re­gions to help keep us go­ing,” he said.</p>
    <p>“They want us to be here.”</p>
    <p>Re­flect­ing on the past year, the lo­cal news­pa­per, the Blayney Chron­i­cle, re­cently re­ported: “(When) peo­ple could again visit the area, Millthorpe’s re­cov­ery and grow­ing renown was as­sured... Millthorpe’s vil­lage and ru­ral res­i­dents can be cau­tiously op­ti­mistic that we have stared down 2020.”</p>
