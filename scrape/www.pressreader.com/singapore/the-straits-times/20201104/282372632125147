    <p>A 46-year-old man of un­sound mind was or­dered to be con­fined at the Pres­i­dent’s plea­sure yes­ter­day after the High Court found that he had killed his 75-year-old fa­ther.</p>
    <p>Jus­tice Va­lerie Thean con­cluded that Tan Kok Meng, who was left alone for three hours with his fa­ther at their Be­dok North flat, caused the death of the older man on Nov 13, 2015.</p>
    <p>When Tan’s mother re­turned to the flat to find her hus­band, Mr Tan Ah Hin, cov­ered in blood, the gate was still pad­locked and there was no sign of forced en­try.</p>
    <p>“No one else could have been re­spon­si­ble for (Mr Tan Ah Hin’s) in­juries, which were not ac­ci­den­tal,” said the judge.</p>
    <p>Although Tan was found to have com­mit­ted the act of killing, un­der the law, he was ac­quit­ted of mur­der owing to his men­tal in­ca­pac­ity.</p>
    <p>Two psy­chi­a­trists from the In­sti­tute of Men­tal Health had di­ag­nosed him with schizophre­nia and found that he was of un­sound mind dur­ing the killing.</p>
    <p>Tan will be con­fined in a psy­chi­atric in­sti­tu­tion, prison or some other place of safe cus­tody.</p>
    <p>There is no min­i­mum pe­riod of de­ten­tion and the men­tal state of the de­tainee is re­viewed reg­u­larly un­til he is suit­able for dis­charge.</p>
    <p>“This is grief twice over for the fam­ily and I would em­pha­sise that this or­der is made in the con­text that Kok Meng has been ac­quit­ted of the of­fence charged,” said the judge.</p>
    <p>“The ob­ject the law seeks to ful­fil by this or­der is the pro­tec­tion of so­ci­ety, and by the same means, the safety of the ac­cused and his fam­ily. It is hoped these rea­sons bring some mea­sure of clo­sure to what I am sure is a painful chap­ter for the fam­ily.”</p>
    <p>After the ver­dict, Tan ap­peared to be in good spir­its and was al­lowed by the court to speak to a few fam­ily mem­bers.</p>
    <p>He had been ac­cused of in­flict­ing mul­ti­ple blows on the vic­tim’s face and stran­gling him.</p>
    <p>The court heard that his fam­ily mem­bers had de­scribed Tan as “un­sta­ble” on the day of the of­fence. His mother, Madam Toh Meow Siang, said he looked dazed the pre­vi­ous two days and had been pac­ing up and down in the flat.</p>
    <p>Be­fore she left the flat, she told her hus­band not to al­low their son to go out. About three hours later, she re­turned to find her hus­band breath­ing heav­ily, with his head in a pool of blood. Tan did not re­spond to her ques­tions.</p>
    <p>Madam Toh left the flat to get help from the neigh­bours. When she re­turned, she shouted at Tan, ask­ing why he killed his fa­ther.</p>
    <p>Tan then walked over to the older man, sat on his ab­domen and placed his hands on his fa­ther’s up­per chest be­fore she pulled him away.</p>
    <p>The paramedics ar­rived soon after. As they at­tended to the vic­tim, Tan sud­denly got up from the sofa where he had been sit­ting in a daze.</p>
    <p>Ig­nor­ing the pleas of the paramedics, he choked his fa­ther while mum­bling “I want him to die” in Man­darin for a minute or so, then went back to sit on the sofa.</p>
    <p>Po­lice of­fi­cers ar­rived shortly after and ar­rested Tan. He told them that he used his bare hands to at­tack his fa­ther.</p>
    <p>The vic­tim was pro­nounced dead at Changi Gen­eral Hos­pi­tal. An au­topsy found that he died from stran­gu­la­tion and blood as­pi­ra­tion.</p>
