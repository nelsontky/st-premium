    <p>The South Korean govern­ment is con­sid­er­ing raising its so­cial dis­tanc­ing re­stric­tions to the high­est level as coro­n­avirus cases spread be­yond the Seoul Met­ro­pol­i­tan area and Bu­san. South Korea re­ported 397 new virus cases yes­ter­day, the high­est since March 7. The num­ber of new in­fec­tions is ex­pected to con­tinue ris­ing.</p>
    <p>SEOUL • South Korea is con­sid­er­ing raising its so­cial dis­tanc­ing re­stric­tions to the high­est level as coro­n­avirus cases spread be­yond the Seoul met­ro­pol­i­tan area and Bu­san.</p>
    <p>The govern­ment is cur­rently study­ing the need to ap­ply Level 3 re­stric­tions, Dr Jung Eun-kyeong, head of the Korea Cen­tres for Dis­ease Con­trol and Pre­ven­tion, said at a brief­ing yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>South Korea re­ported 397 new virus cases yes­ter­day, the high­est num­ber since March 7. New in­fec­tions are ex­pected to con­tinue ris­ing, said Dr Jung.</p>
    <p>The govern­ment has ex­panded Level 2 so­cial dis­tanc­ing rules – al­ready in place in the Seoul met­ro­pol­i­tan area and Bu­san – to the rest of the coun­try.</p>
    <p>Level 2 re­stric­tions for­bid gath­er­ings of 50 or more peo­ple in­doors, and 100 or more out­doors, with lim­its placed on events such as wed­dings, church ser­vices and sports games. It also pre­vents the op­er­a­tion of 12 types of “high-risk” fa­cil­i­ties such as bars and stand­ing con­cert halls.</p>
    <p>The Seoul met­ro­pol­i­tan govern­ment said yes­ter­day that face masks would be manda­tory for in­door and crowded out­door ar­eas in Seoul from mid­night.</p>
    <p>In June, South Korea adopted a so­cial dis­tanc­ing sys­tem with three lev­els of re­stric­tions. Level 3 – the high­est – pro­hibits meet­ings and events of 10 peo­ple or more, and gives the au­thor­i­ties the power to limit busi­ness hours at malls and re­tail stores.</p>
    <p>The na­tion of 50 mil­lion peo­ple has so far recorded 17,399 in­fec­tions and 309 fa­tal­i­ties.</p>
    <p>It re­ported more than 5,000 in­fec­tions re­lated to a re­li­gious sect called Shin­cheonji be­tween Fe­bru­ary and March, which made South Korea the sec­ond­worst in the world to be hit by the virus at that time.</p>
    <p>Ear­lier this month, hun­dreds of cases were tied to the Sarang Jeil Church, which has said it will sue the Seoul govern­ment for en­forc­ing con­tact trac­ing.</p>
    <p>Last Fri­day, its rep­re­sen­ta­tives said at a press con­fer­ence out­side the church in Seong­buk, a district in north­ern Seoul, that the po­lice – un­der the di­rec­tion of the city of­fice – “forcibly en­tered the church” in try­ing to ob­tain in­for­ma­tion for con­tact trac­ing. The fierce stand-off be­tween church of­fi­cials and the po­lice lasted nearly 10 hours.</p>
    <p>“We will take le­gal ac­tion against Seoul of­fi­cials for or­der­ing the po­lice search,” they said.</p>
    <p>The church is ac­cused of with­hold­ing key de­tails and re­fus­ing to co­op­er­ate with pub­lic health of­fi­cials. Its lead­ers claim their free­dom to wor­ship is un­der threat from the new govern­ment or­ders.</p>
    <p>The church’s pas­tor, Rev­erend Jun Kwang-hoon, was di­ag­nosed with Covid-19 last Mon­day, af­ter claim­ing to be healthy at a rally at­tended by hun­dreds in cen­tral Seoul.</p>
    <p>The next day, the govern­ment banned in-per­son ser­vices and gath­er­ings at churches in the Seoul area. Chris­tian groups said this vi­o­lates their right to prac­tise their faith. In a mes­sage to its mem­bers, the Com­mu­nion of Churches in Korea said last Thurs­day that the or­ders were “not ac­cept­able”, and that “ser­vices can­not be stopped”.</p>
    <p>The health au­thor­i­ties said cer­tain wor­ship ac­tiv­i­ties such as singing to­gether can in­crease the like­li­hood of coro­n­avirus trans­mis­sion. Last month, 11 peo­ple who at­tended choir prac­tice at a church in Songpa, in south­ern Seoul, tested pos­i­tive for the coro­n­avirus.</p>
    <p>Some ex­perts worry that the fin­ger-point­ing could in­ter­fere with con­tact trac­ing ef­forts.</p>
    <p>In­fec­tious dis­ease spe­cial­ist Ja­cob Lee of Hal­lym Univer­sity Hos­pi­tal in Gyeonggi Prov­ince said: “From Shin­cheonji to night­clubs to churches, the sub­ject of anger seems to be shift­ing as the pan­demic un­folds. But blam­ing will only make it harder for peo­ple to seek test­ing.”</p>
