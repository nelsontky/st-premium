    <p>Ac­tress Anne Watan­abe, the daugh­ter of Hol­ly­wood star Ken Watan­abe, has di­vorced her ac­tor hus­band Masahiro Hi­gashide af­ter he was found to be hav­ing an af­fair.</p>
    <p>One of the most fa­mous celebrity cou­ples in Ja­pan, Watan­abe, 34, and Hi­gashide, 32, had been mar­ried for five years and have three chil­dren.</p>
    <p>They an­nounced their split last Satur­day and promised to work to­gether to take care of their chil­dren.</p>
    <p>Watan­abe, who is also a model, sep­a­rated from Hi­gashide af­ter news about his af­fair with ac­tress Erika Karata broke in Jan­uary.</p>
    <p>Both Hi­gashide and Karata, 22, have made sep­a­rate apolo­gies for it.</p>
    <p>The two re­port­edly be­gan their af­fair in 2017 while shoot­ing the movie Asako I & II (2018). Karata, best known for her role in South Korean drama Arth­dal Chron­i­cles (2019), was 19 then.</p>
    <p>Watan­abe was preg­nant at the time with the cou­ple’s son, who was born in Novem­ber 2017. The cou­ple have a pair of twin daugh­ters born in 2016.</p>
    <p>The scan­dal was a ma­jor blow to Hi­gashide and Karata’s ca­reers, with the ac­tor los­ing his en­dorse­ment deals and Karata be­ing dropped from her act­ing roles.</p>
    <p>Hi­gashide de­clined to clar­ify if he wanted a di­vorce from Wanatabe, but when re­porters asked him if he liked Karata or his wife more, he said he could not an­swer as it would “hurt his wife”.</p>
    <p>Clips of his re­sponse were widely shared on­line, caus­ing swelling pub­lic anger to­wards him.</p>
    <p>Hi­gashide made his act­ing de­but in The Kirishima Thing (2012), a movie about high school stu­dents, and went on to star in movies such as Death Note: Light Up The New World (2016).</p>
    <p>He and Watan­abe be­came ro­man­ti­cally in­volved af­ter play­ing a cou­ple in drama se­ries Gochisosan (2013-2014). They mar­ried in 2015.</p>
