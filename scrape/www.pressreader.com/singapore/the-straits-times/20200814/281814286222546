    <p>WILMINGTON (Delaware) • Demo­cratic White House hope­ful Joe Bi­den in­tro­duced his vice-pres­i­den­tial can­di­date Ka­mala Har­ris at their first joint ap­pear­ance as an in­spir­ing wo­man who would help him to “re­build this coun­try”.</p>
    <p>Ac­cus­ing Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump of fail­ing to lead dur­ing the coro­n­avirus cri­sis, Mr Bi­den on Wed­nes­day said that he and Ms Har­ris would fix “the mess that Pres­i­dent Trump and Vice-Pres­i­dent Pence have cre­ated at home and abroad”.</p>
    <p>Ms Har­ris said Mr Bi­den, who was vice-pres­i­dent un­der pres­i­dent Barack Obama, had recog­nised the crit­i­cal mo­ment be­ing faced by the coun­try by pick­ing her to be the first black wo­man and Asian Amer­i­can on a ma­jor-party US pres­i­den­tial ticket.</p>
    <p>“To­day, he takes his place in the on­go­ing story of Amer­ica’s march to­wards equal­ity and jus­tice as the only per­son who served along­side the first black pres­i­dent, and has cho­sen the first black wo­man as his run­ning mate,” said Ms Har­ris, a US sen­a­tor from Cal­i­for­nia.</p>
    <p>Nearly nine out of 10 Democrats ap­proved of Ms Har­ris as Mr Bi­den’s pick, a Reuters/Ip­sos poll re­leased on Wed­nes­day showed.</p>
    <p>Ms Har­ris said she had long ad­mired Mr Bi­den’s com­mit­ment to his fam­ily and coun­try, and she de­scribed him as ready to meet the chal­lenges cre­ated by Mr Trump’s fail­ures in han­dling the pan­demic and its eco­nomic con­se­quences, as well as racial un­rest.</p>
    <p>“This is a mo­ment of real con­se­quence for Amer­ica. Every­thing we care about – our econ­omy, our health, our kids, the kind of coun­try we live in – it’s all on the line.</p>
    <p>“Amer­ica is cry­ing out for lead­er­ship, yet we have a pres­i­dent who cares more about him­self than the peo­ple who elected him, a pres­i­dent who is mak­ing ev­ery chal­lenge we face even more dif­fi­cult to solve,” Ms Har­ris said.</p>
    <p>The speech, de­liv­ered in a Delaware high school gym­na­sium near Mr Bi­den’s home, fea­tured no cheer­ing crowds. The two can­di­dates wore masks as they ar­rived and kept their so­cial dis­tance on a stage flanked by state flags.</p>
    <p>The joint ap­pear­ance came just days be­fore Mr Bi­den will for­mally ac­cept the Demo­cratic pres­i­den­tial nom­i­na­tion at next week’s party con­ven­tion, which will take place largely as a vir­tual event due to Covid-19.</p>
    <p>The Repub­li­can con­ven­tion, at which Mr Trump is set to be nom­i­nated to seek a sec­ond four-year term, fol­lows a week later and kicks off a 10-week sprint to elec­tion day on Nov 3.</p>
    <p>In choos­ing Ms Har­ris, Mr Bi­den has picked a for­mer ri­val for the nom­i­na­tion whose most mem­o­rable cam­paign mo­ment came dur­ing a tele­vised de­bate when she crit­i­cised his past po­si­tion on us­ing bussing to in­te­grate schools and talked about its ef­fect on her as a lit­tle girl.</p>
    <p>Mr Bi­den said her ad­di­tion to the ticket sent a pow­er­ful mes­sage to girls across Amer­ica.</p>
    <p>“This morn­ing, all across the na­tion, lit­tle girls woke up – es­pe­cially lit­tle black and brown girls, who so of­ten feel over­looked and un­der­val­ued in their com­mu­ni­ties – to­day, just maybe, they’re see­ing them­selves in the first time in a new way. As the stuff of pres­i­dents, and vi­cepres­i­dents,” Mr Bi­den said.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump, who has un­leashed sex­ist at­tacks on Ms Har­ris, called her “a very risky pick” at a news con­fer­ence as he re­ferred to “hor­ri­ble things” she had said about Mr Bi­den dur­ing the pri­mary cam­paign, sug­gest­ing those words would haunt the ticket.</p>
    <p>He also de­fended his ad­min­is­tra­tion’s re­sponse to the coro­n­avirus, cit­ing the num­ber of tests that have been ad­min­is­tered and bragging about the gov­ern­ment’s ef­forts to ramp up pro­duc­tion of ven­ti­la­tors to help gravely ill pa­tients.</p>
