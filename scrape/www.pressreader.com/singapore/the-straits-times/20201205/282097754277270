    <p>Sin­ga­pore is right to be dis­ap­pointed with the de­ci­sion by the United Na­tions Com­mis­sion on Nar­cotic Drugs (CND) to re­move cannabis from the most tightly con­trolled cat­e­gory of nar­cotic drugs. The coun­try must stick to its own anti-nar­cotics pro­to­cols so that the mas­sive ef­fort in­vested over the decades in pro­tect­ing the pop­u­la­tion, par­tic­u­larly the young, from drugs is not held hostage by the va­garies of in­ter­na­tional opin­ion. As it is, the vote in favour of the change in clas­si­fi­ca­tion for cannabis and cannabis-re­lated sub­stances was very close at the CND ses­sion this week: 27 states voted for it, 25 voted against it, and one state ab­stained. Clearly, there is no global con­sen­sus on the is­sue. Yet, the suc­cess­ful re­moval of cannabis from a list­ing of the most dan­ger­ous drugs, such as heroin, would ap­pear to send out the mes­sage that it is no longer the men­ace that it was thought to be.</p>
    <p>That is the new dan­ger.</p>
    <p>Go­ing against the more lib­eral views of some coun­tries about the safety and ef­fi­cacy of cannabis and its re­lated sub­stances for med­i­cal pur­poses, there is, in­stead, sound re­search that es­tab­lishes sev­eral ad­verse ef­fects, in­clud­ing the im­pair­ment of res­pi­ra­tory and cog­ni­tive func­tions. Prob­lem­at­i­cally, the CND vote will con­tinue to fuel mis­per­cep­tions that trusted global bod­ies such as the World Health Or­gan­i­sa­tion and the CND now con­sider cannabis to be less harm­ful. As those mis­per­cep­tions can only en­cour­age more abuse, this week’s vote should not be seen as en­dors­ing the recre­ational use of cannabis and green-light­ing the even greater lib­er­al­i­sa­tion of cannabis.</p>
    <p>That threat would go against the grain of Sin­ga­pore’s long-stated and trans­par­ently held po­si­tion that il­licit drugs, in­clud­ing cannabis, are harm­ful and ad­dic­tive and de­stroy lives, fam­i­lies and com­mu­ni­ties. The coun­try should con­tinue with its firm stance against the lure of drugs, in­clud­ing so-called soft drugs, be­cause no such “soft” sub­sti­tutes should sim­i­larly be al­lowed. The au­thor­i­ties here note that drug abuse causes changes to the brain and body that, over time, de­stroy an abuser’s self-con­trol and abil­ity to re­sist drugs. Im­paired judg­ment and the loss of self-con­trol are hall­marks of an ad­dic­tion that can only lead abusers on a down­ward spi­ral. There is no “soft” al­ter­na­tive to that hard de­struc­tion of per­sonal au­ton­omy and fa­mil­ial and so­cial safety.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore is not alone in this re­gard. At the CND ses­sion, it joined other coun­tries in a state­ment de­liv­ered by Rus­sia. Twenty-eight coun­tries, in­clud­ing In­done­sia and the Philip­pines, were aligned with Sin­ga­pore’s stance. Cannabis is the most widely abused drug in the world. It falls on ev­ery like-minded na­tion to en­sure that this sit­u­a­tion is not com­pounded by in­ter­na­tional moves that could weaken the fight against drugs.</p>
