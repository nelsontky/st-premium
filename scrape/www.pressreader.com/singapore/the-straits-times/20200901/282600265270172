    <p>The­atre vet­eran Ang Gey Pin has a very zen ap­proach to the dis­rup­tions caused by the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>The 53-year-old’s lat­est project, Dreamtalk, was orig­i­nally slated as part of the NUS Fes­ti­val of Arts, or­gan­ised by the Na­tional Univer­sity of Sin­ga­pore’s Cen­tre For The Arts (CFA), in March. But Covid-19 put paid to the fes­ti­val and the show is go­ing dig­i­tal in­stead.</p>
    <p>It will be screened on a pay-asyou-wish ba­sis on the Zoom video plat­form on Fri­day and Satur­day. Each show will be fol­lowed by a ques­tion-and-an­swer ses­sion with the per­form­ers.</p>
    <p>Asked about how she dealt with the chal­lenges of restag­ing, the vet­eran ac­tress says: “In life, there is one thing that never changes and that is ‘change’. So, the cur­rent cir­cum­stance has gifted us a chance to re­spond to this ‘law’ in life. Now, it is as if I have been walk­ing and sud­denly I need to drive.</p>
    <p>“I still jour­ney, but the views on the way are all dif­fer­ent and I am dis­cov­er­ing new things from ex­pe­ri­enc­ing, re­spond­ing and con­nect­ing to each mo­ment of the jour­ney. I am pro­cess­ing new ex­pe­ri­ences and re­flect­ing on pre­vi­ous ex­pe­ri­ences.”</p>
    <p>Dreamtalk, a phys­i­cal the­atre piece un­fold­ing in a house where a guardian keeps watch over a young dreamer, is a col­lab­o­ra­tion be­tween Ang and the­atre stud­ies hon­ours grad­u­ate Ran­ice Tay.</p>
    <p>Ang, who was a mem­ber of the renowned Work­cen­ter of Jerzy Gro­towski and Thomas Richards and co-founder of The­atre OX, di­rected Tay for a the­atre stud­ies pro­duc­tion.</p>
    <p>She says col­lab­o­rat­ing with her for­mer stu­dent is also a way for her to learn: “Mr Kuo Pao Kun says you need to start from prac­tice. That’s why he chose the name Prac­tice The­atre for his group. You learn from do­ing.”</p>
    <p>Tay, 23, says work­ing with her men­tor is “a pe­riod of time I can­not trade for any­thing else”.</p>
    <p>She is ap­pre­cia­tive of the CFA’s sup­port for her prac­tice as the­atre per­for­mance, which has been brew­ing for a year. “(I have) the space, the re­sources to help me de­velop work that nour­ishes my soul.”</p>
    <p>Ms Mary Loh, 60, the CFA’s se­nior as­so­ciate di­rec­tor, says such ex­changes be­tween prac­ti­tion­ers and stu­dents are what she wants to en­cour­age with her pro­gram­ming.</p>
    <p>While the fes­ti­val has been scup­pered, some of the shows will go to the ExxonMo­bil Cam­pus Con­certs while Dreamtalk and an­other pro­duc­tion Blindspot, an NUS Chi­nese drama about a girl whose mother is go­ing blind, are go­ing dig­i­tal.</p>
    <p>Ms Loh notes that the ex­pe­ri­ence has been an “in­cred­i­bly steep learn­ing curve” for the team.</p>
    <p>But there is a sil­ver lin­ing as Dreamtalk can now reach Ang’s au­di­ences around the world. The Fri­day show is sched­uled for the odd time of 10.59pm, Ms Loh says.</p>
    <p>“The rea­son for the strange tim­ing is be­cause the per­form­ers are cap­tur­ing that mo­ment be­tween wake­ful­ness into sleep, into a spe­cial time of con­scious­ness.</p>
    <p>“Be­sides that, Gey Pin’s on­line au­di­ences are also in the United States and Europe and the tim­ing al­lows us to ac­com­mo­date them.”</p>
    <p>Ang says go­ing dig­i­tal has also opened up new vis­tas for her as a prac­ti­tioner: “And now there is a huge spa­tial in­ter­re­la­tion be­tween the cre­ative team and the au­di­ence. There is some­thing of a third, or fourth space; a hy­brid, in-be­tween, semi-pub­lic space, through a dig­i­tal ver­sion of a live per­for­mance.</p>
    <p>“All th­ese, we hope to evoke the imag­i­na­tive world and the per­spec­tives from the in­ner child in each of us.”</p>
