    <p>Some present and for­mer cabin crew with a nur­tur­ing tem­per­a­ment have found work in the early child­hood sec­tor.</p>
    <p>One of them is Ms Tay Ru Xin, 24, a cur­rent cabin crew mem­ber with low-cost car­rier Scoot, who has been a full-time English teacher at Su­per­land Montes­sori Pre-school in Ganges Av­enue since Septem­ber.</p>
    <p>Nowa­days, she pre­pares les­son plans, teaches and man­ages her class of 15 nursery two stu­dents, who are aged four, as well as com­mu­ni­cates reg­u­larly with their par­ents. The in­ter­na­tional pre-school has stu­dents from coun­tries such as Sin­ga­pore, South Korea, Ja­pan, In­dia and Is­rael.</p>
    <p>Ms Tay, who grad­u­ated from Ngee Ann Polytech­nic with a di­ploma in early child­hood ed­u­ca­tion in 2017, says: “When faced with po­ten­tially sticky sit­u­a­tions with par­ents at the pre-school, I find my­self re­ly­ing on my ex­pe­ri­ence with pas­sen­gers dur­ing my fly­ing days.”</p>
    <p>Be­ing mind­ful of her tone and choice of words, and show­ing re­spect to the par­ent or child she is speak­ing to help smooth over tense sit­u­a­tions.</p>
    <p>“It sounds sim­ple, but not many can do it un­der pres­sure, let alone find a so­lu­tion to per­form a ‘ser­vice re­cov­ery’.”</p>
    <p>Trav­el­ling around the world and be­ing ex­posed to many dif­fer­ent cul­tures have also helped her to be open-minded and con­ver­sant in dif­fer­ent lan­guages.</p>
    <p>It has helped her com­mu­ni­cate with her South Korean stu­dents in their na­tive l an­guage, such as count­ing from one to 10, and us­ing phrases such as “hello”, “good job” and “please”, which she picked up to bet­ter i nter­act with Korean pas­sen­gers when fly­ing.</p>
    <p>“I think I am bet­ter with chil­dren than be­fore and this will help when in­ter­act­ing with young pas­sen­gers,” she says, hope­ful of don­ning her stew­ardess uni­form again when travel re­stric­tions are lifted.</p>
    <p>For Ms Fleur Ong, 31, a for­mer Sin­ga­pore Air­lines (SIA) cabin crew who com­pleted her 10-year con­tract with t he air­line last month, fly­ing trained her i n cus­tomer ser­vice and pro­fes­sion­al­ism, which she hopes will stand her in good stead in her new ca­reer.</p>
    <p>She started work last week as a se­nior par­ent li­ai­son ex­ec­u­tive at EtonHouse In­ter­na­tional Ed­u­ca­tion Group.</p>
    <p>She hopes her ex­pe­ri­ence in­ter­act­ing with peo­ple from dif­fer­ent cul­tures will be use­ful when forg­ing re­la­tion­ships with EtonHouse’s global com­mu­nity of par­ents, stu­dents and col­leagues.</p>
    <p>Her new role has a strong cus­tomer fo­cus and re­quires her to think on her feet, stay calm and be re­spect­ful at all times.</p>
    <p>“When I was fly­ing, we were al­ways kept on our toes, es­pe­cially dur­ing an emer­gency or in a space where re­sources are lim­ited.</p>
    <p>“No mat­ter how dif­fi­cult and stress­ful the sit­u­a­tions got, we could al­ways stay calm,” she says.</p>
    <p>EtonHouse re­cently launched a na­tion­wide re­cruit­ment drive, of­fer­ing for­mer SIA staff more than 100 po­si­tions in EtonHouse schools and its E-Bridge PreSchools.</p>
    <p>So far, it has of­fered po­si­tions to seven can­di­dates in both the teach­ing and ad­min­is­tra­tion roles, and is cur­rently in­ter­view­ing for other po­si­tions.</p>
    <p>Mr Ng Yi Xian, 35, EtonHouse’s ex­ec­u­tive di­rec­tor, says: “Schools can be a very dy­namic en­vi­ron­ment too. Thus, the ex­pe­ri­ence that for­mer SIA staff have will help them to han­dle all types of sit­u­a­tions with equa­nim­ity.”</p>
