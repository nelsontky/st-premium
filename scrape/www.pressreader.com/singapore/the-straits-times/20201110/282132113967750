    <p>The At­tor­ney-Gen­eral (AG) has ap­pointed Se­nior Coun­sel Alvin Yeo from WongPart­ner­ship to de­fend a le­gal suit brought by lawyer M. Ravi who is seek­ing ac­cess to cer­tain doc­u­ments and an­swers to ques­tions in re­la­tion to 11 prison in­mates, most of whom are on death row.</p>
    <p>The ap­point­ment of an ex­ter­nal coun­sel will ob­vi­ate a po­ten­tial con­flict of in­ter­est and en­sure the AG is above board in deal­ing with a case where it is the de­fen­dant, said lawyers in­ter­viewed yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Mr Ravi’s orig­i­nat­ing sum­mons also named a sec­ond de­fen­dant – the Su­per­in­ten­dent of Changi Prison, who is de­fended by Mr Abra­ham Ver­gis, man­ag­ing direc­tor of Prov­i­dence Law Asia.</p>
    <p>One of the plain­tiffs in the suit is con­victed drug run­ner Gobi Ave­dian, who was spared the gal­lows last month by a five-mem­ber Court of Ap­peal and given 15 years’ jail and 10 strokes of the cane in­stead.</p>
    <p>The other plain­tiffs are un­der­stood to be death row in­mates, in­clud­ing con­victed drug traf­ficker Syed Suhail Syed Zin.</p>
    <p>The Court of Ap­peal last month al­lowed Syed Suhail leave for a ju­di­cial re­view to ar­gue his claim that death row in­mates are not be­ing treated equally in the sched­ul­ing of ex­e­cu­tions.</p>
    <p>Also on the list is Iskan­dar Rah­mat, who was given the death sen­tence for the 2013 Ko­van Road dou­ble mur­der.</p>
    <p>He had killed a car work­shop owner and the man’s son, and while flee­ing in a car along Up­per Seran­goon Road, he had dragged the son’s body un­der the car.</p>
    <p>In his suit, Mr Ravi is ap­ply­ing to the court for copies of let­ters from the AG to the prison seek­ing from the prison copies of the 11 in­mates’ cor­re­spon­dence.</p>
    <p>He also wants copies of let­ters from the prison to the AG, en­clos­ing copies of the 11 plain­tiffs’ cor­re­spon­dence.</p>
    <p>In ad­di­tion, he wants copies of the plain­tiffs’ cor­re­spon­dence that was for­warded by the prison to the AG, in­clud­ing the en­clo­sures.</p>
    <p>Among other things, Mr Ravi wants to know as well if any of the re­ferred in­mates’ cor­re­spon­dence was not re­quested by the pub­lic pros­e­cu­tor and whether any of the cor­re­spon­dence was dis­closed to the pub­lic pros­e­cu­tor.</p>
    <p>His ap­pli­ca­tion to the court is for a pre-ac­tion dis­cov­ery based on court rules, mean­ing he seeks to in­spect the doc­u­ments and ob­tain an­swers to re­lated queries to de­cide if fur­ther ac­tion is to be launched.</p>
    <p>A High Court pre-trial con­fer­ence is due next week.</p>
    <p>The AG’s move to bring in an ex­ter­nal party as de­fence coun­sel is to en­sure there is no sug­ges­tion it is not deal­ing with this mat­ter ap­pro­pri­ately when faced with al­le­ga­tions.</p>
    <p>Mr Su­nil Sud­heesan, pres­i­dent of the As­so­ci­a­tion of Crim­i­nal Lawyers Sin­ga­pore, said the ap­point­ment was a “pru­dent move” as the AG has a right to be rep­re­sented when faced with a suit.</p>
    <p>Veteran lawyer Peter Ong Lip Cheng said ap­point­ing ex­ter­nal coun­sel will en­sure the AG is above board in deal­ing with a case where it is the de­fen­dant.</p>
    <p>Mr Ong added: “It is also gen­er­ally ac­cepted to be un­wise for a de­fen­dant to rep­re­sent him­self.”</p>
    <p>When con­tacted, Se­nior Coun­sel Yeo said: “As al­le­ga­tions have been made against our client, they have en­gaged us to deal with the mat­ter ap­pro­pri­ately and ex­pe­di­tiously.</p>
    <p>“As the mat­ter is now be­fore the court, we are not able to com­ment fur­ther.”</p>
