    <p>The US gov­ern­ment’s an­titrust as­sault against Google re­veals new de­tails about a se­cre­tive, multi-bil­lion-dol­lar deal be­tween the In­ter­net gi­ant and Ap­ple, the world’s l argest tech­nol­ogy com­pany.</p>
    <p>The law­suit filed on Tues­day by the Depart­ment of Jus­tice (DOJ) tar­gets paid deals that Google ne­go­ti­ates to get its search en­gine to be the de­fault on browsers, smart­phones and other de­vices.</p>
    <p>The big­gest of these is an agree­ment that makes Google search the de­fault on iPhones and other Ap­ple de­vices.</p>
    <p>The US gov­ern­ment said Ap­ple chief ex­ec­u­tive of­fi­cer Tim Cook and his Google coun­ter­part Sun­dar Pichai met in 2018 to dis­cuss the deal. Af­ter that, an uniden­ti­fied se­nior Ap­ple em­ployee wrote to a Google coun­ter­part that “our vi­sion is that we work as if we are one com­pany”.</p>
    <p>The DOJ also cited in its suit in­ter­nal Google doc­u­ments that call the Ap­ple search deal a “sig­nif­i­cant rev­enue chan­nel” for the search gi­ant and one that, if lost, would re­sult in a “Code Red” sce­nario. That is be­cause nearly half of Google search traf­fic last year came from Ap­ple prod­ucts, ac­cord­ing to the law­suit.</p>
    <p>The de­tails, many of which have not been dis­closed be­fore, may sup­port the US gov­ern­ment’s al­le­ga­tion that Google uses these agree­ments to block out search ri­vals and to present con­sumers with less choice.</p>
    <p>Google called the gov­ern­ment’s case “deeply flawed” and said it would hurt con­sumers be­cause it would “ar­ti­fi­cially prop up” low­erqual­ity search op­tions.</p>
    <p>The Jus­tice Depart­ment fo­cused in par­tic­u­lar on the deal be­tween Ap­ple and Google, say­ing it “sub­stan­tially fore­closes Google’s search ri­vals from an im­por­tant dis­tri­bu­tion chan­nel for a sig­nif­i­cant, multi-year term”.</p>
    <p>Google pays Ap­ple bil­lions of dol­lars a year to make its search prod­uct the de­fault op­tion, ac­cord­ing to an­a­lyst es­ti­mates. That means when a user buys a new iPhone or other Ap­ple device, the built-in search en­gine in the Sa­fari browser is Google.</p>
    <p>Ap­ple users have the op­tion to man­u­ally switch to Mi­crosoft’s Bing, Ya­hoo Search or Duck­DuckGo, but “few peo­ple do, mak­ing Google the de facto ex­clu­sive search en­gine” on Ap­ple de­vices, ac­cord­ing to the DOJ.</p>
    <p>The depart­ment’s law­suit also cited es­ti­mates that Ap­ple gets US$8 bil­lion to US$12 bil­lion (S$10.8 bil­lion to S$16.3 bil­lion) an­nu­ally from Google through the agree­ment.</p>
    <p>Ap­ple’s in­come from the search deal is be­lieved to be part of the com­pany’s grow­ing Ser­vices seg­ment, a key met­ric the com­pany has high­lighted to in­vestors and an­a­lysts in re­cent years.</p>
    <p>“By pay­ing Ap­ple a por­tion of the mo­nop­oly rents ex­tracted from ad­ver­tis­ers, Google has aligned Ap­ple’s fi­nan­cial in­cen­tives with its own and set the price of bid­ding for dis­tri­bu­tion ex­tremely high,” the DOJ said.</p>
    <p>As part of the deal, Google is also the de­fault search en­gine for Siri and sys­tem search, re­plac­ing a deal that Ap­ple had with Mi­crosoft in 2017.</p>
    <p>Ap­ple does not of­fer a way for users to switch search en­gines dur­ing the ini­tial setup process for its de­vices, nor does it sug­gest to users that they can switch their search en­gine when they first use Sa­fari on an Ap­ple device.</p>
    <p>Ap­ple said that, in ad­di­tion to be­ing able to change the de­fault search en­gine af­ter setup, users can ac­cess third-party search apps, third-party voice as­sis­tant apps or visit another search en­gine’s web­site.</p>
    <p>Ap­ple’s chief com­pli­ance of­fi­cer Kyle An­deer told a con­gres­sional hear­ing last year that the com­pany “con­ducted an open com­pe­ti­tion to see what did we think would be best for our con­sumers, and con­sumers have al­ways gone to Google”.</p>
