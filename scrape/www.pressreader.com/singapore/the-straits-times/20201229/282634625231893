    <p>Dee­jay So­nia Chew has been dropped from host­ing Me­di­a­corp’s an­nual count­down show amid a probe into whether Covid-19 safe dis­tanc­ing rules were breached at a party for ac­tor Jef­frey Xu.</p>
    <p>The 987FM pre­sen­ter, who was at the party, was sup­posed to host Let’s Cel­e­brate 2021 with dee­jay Joakim Gomez, but has since been re­placed by dee­jay Jean Danker.</p>
    <p>Me­di­a­corp said in a state­ment to The Straits Times: “We take this mat­ter se­ri­ously and con­stantly brief and re­mind our artists to ad­here to safe man­age­ment guide­lines at all times. We are also co­op­er­at­ing fully with the au­thor­i­ties in their in­ves­ti­ga­tions.</p>
    <p>“In the mean­time, Jean Danker will be host­ing Let’s Cel­e­brate 2021 with Joakim Gomez. ”</p>
    <p>Chew, 29, was among sev­eral artists spot­ted in a pic­ture taken at Xu’s 32nd birth­day, which was re­port­edly up­loaded by Xu on Oct 3 onto his In­sta­gram Sto­ries.</p>
    <p>It showed 13 peo­ple at the cel­e­bra­tion, in what looked to be a pri­vate residence, with Xu hold­ing a cake. Celebri­ties spot­ted in the pic­ture in­clude Xu, Chew, ac­tors Ter­ence Cao, Shane Pow, Jeremy Chan and ac­tress Julie Tan. No one was wear­ing a mask.</p>
    <p>A reader alerted Chi­nese news­pa­per Shin Min Daily News to the pic­ture ear­lier this month. Me­di­a­corp, which man­ages Xu, Chew, Pow and Cao, later con­firmed that the pic­ture was taken in Oc­to­ber and said its artists apol­o­gise for their mis­takes. At that time, only up to five could gather out­side the house­hold and each house­hold had a cap of five vis­i­tors at any one time. The Min­istry of Na­tional De­vel­op­ment is in­ves­ti­gat­ing the in­ci­dent.</p>
    <p>All the stars spot­ted in the pic­ture have since apol­o­gised on their so­cial me­dia ac­counts.</p>
    <p>Tan, who is man­aged by ac­tor Li Nanx­ing’s tal­ent agency, was the first to do so last Thurs­day. The rest, who had pre­vi­ously kept quiet about the scan­dal on­line, all said sorry last Satur­day.</p>
    <p>Chew ex­plained in her post: “I was in­vited to have drinks with what I un­der­stood to be a small group of peo­ple and was not aware it was a birth­day cel­e­bra­tion.”</p>
    <p>She said she was not mak­ing ex­cuses, not­ing that she did not leave when she saw more than five peo­ple at the scene. She added: “It was a se­vere lapse of judg­ment on my part in this case and from the bot­tom of my heart, I am so sorry.”</p>
    <p>Sim­i­larly, Pow, 29, wrote that he was “deeply re­gret­ful of my ac­tions”, while Cao, Xu and Chan also apol­o­gised for not set­ting a good ex­am­ple as pub­lic fig­ures.</p>
