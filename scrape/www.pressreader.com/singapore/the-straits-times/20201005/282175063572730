    <p>The dev­as­tat­ing im­pact of Covid-19 on the global econ­omy is rip­pling across the world. For many business lead­ers, the pan­demic has dis­rupted ev­ery as­pect of their or­gan­i­sa­tion – from peo­ple to rev­enues.</p>
    <p>The work they do on both fronts now will shape the fu­ture of their or­gan­i­sa­tions and, in ef­fect, Sin­ga­pore’s econ­omy.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing a cri­sis, busi­nesses as­sign a net­work of teams to re­spond out­side the pa­ram­e­ters of nor­mal oper­a­tions and ad­just rou­tine ac­tiv­i­ties. The best way to do this is to look at the cri­sis in three dis­tinct phases: re­act and re­spond, re­cover, and re­shape.</p>
    <p>All com­pa­nies, par­tic­u­larly multi­na­tion­als, will be deal­ing with the sep­a­rate stages at dif­fer­ent times in vary­ing lev­els of sever­ity.</p>
    <p>An Aon sur­vey con­ducted in Au­gust found that only about 9 per cent of Sin­ga­pore com­pa­nies are in the “re­act and re­spond” phase, while 65 per cent are in the “re­cover” phase and 26 per cent in the “re­shape” phase.</p>
    <p>Un­der­stand­ing where each part of the or­gan­i­sa­tion is within the model at a given time will aid in quick de­ci­sion-mak­ing, op­ti­mal com­mu­ni­ca­tion, plan­ning and pri­ori­ti­sa­tion.</p>
    <p>It is also im­por­tant to note that the pan­demic and its eco­nomic ram­i­fi­ca­tions can­not be viewed as lin­ear or mono­lithic.</p>
    <p>There are hid­den in­ter-con­nec­tiv­i­ties that com­bine to cre­ate an im­pact on busi­nesses.</p>
    <p>A PHASED AP­PROACH TO A CRI­SIS</p>
    <p>Com­pa­nies in Sin­ga­pore would have been con­fronted with the re­act and re­spond phase start­ing in April dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing this phase, business lead­ers should ide­ally re­act to the im­me­di­ate needs of the emer­gency while com­mu­ni­cat­ing clearly and fre­quently to both em­ploy­ees and stake­hold­ers.</p>
    <p>As­sess­ing avail­able liq­uid­ity to cover costs and en­sure sol­vency, es­tab­lish­ing share­holder and in­vestor com­mit­ments, and hav­ing clear vis­i­bil­ity of gov­ern­ment pol­icy and reg­u­la­tions are cru­cial as­pects of this phase.</p>
    <p>As com­pa­nies move into the re­cover phase, sta­bil­is­ing the business comes into sharper fo­cus.</p>
    <p>This in­cludes for­mu­lat­ing re­turn-to-work­place mea­sures and new op­er­at­ing mod­els to main­tain con­ti­nu­ity for em­ploy­ees and re­tain cus­tomers.</p>
    <p>All these steps pre­clude a re­liance on data and an­a­lyt­ics to re­fore­cast fre­quently, make on­go­ing business plan ad­just­ments and de­velop re­cap­i­tal­i­sa­tion strate­gies.</p>
    <p>In Sin­ga­pore, many com­pa­nies are now in the re­cov­ery phase. This in­volves analysing the im­pact, un­der­stand­ing their own ca­pac­ity for re­silience, and de­vis­ing ways to pro­tect their peo­ple and re­vi­talise their business. These strate­gies are fur­ther op­ti­mised when they are done in col­lab­o­ra­tion with gov­ern­ment pol­i­cy­mak­ers and reg­u­la­tory bod­ies.</p>
    <p>A re­cent ex­am­ple of early re­sponse in con­junc­tion with gov­ern­ment pol­icy is the Sin­ga­pore Air­lines (SIA) Group. Up till June, SIA re­sisted re­trench­ing staff while the rest of the sec­tor glob­ally re­sorted to lay­offs to cope with mount­ing losses.</p>
    <p>SIA first tapped the Gov­ern­ment’s Jobs Sup­port Scheme, which of­fers wage sup­port to firms of up to 75 per cent for nine months. It reined in costs and froze re­cruit­ment, fol­lowed by salary cuts and vol­un­tary de­par­ture schemes up un­til July. When it fi­nally re­trenched staff last month, the ex­er­cise was done in close con­sul­ta­tion with the labour unions.</p>
    <p>Fi­nally, in the re­shape phase, busi­nesses will need to re­build their strat­egy and pri­or­i­ties for the new nor­mal.</p>
    <p>Re­defin­ing com­pany goals may mean new business mod­els and new peo­ple strate­gies.</p>
    <p>The pan­demic has raised im­por­tant ques­tions. “What con­sti­tutes an ag­ile work­force?” is one. Our sur­vey par­tic­i­pants defined an ag­ile work­force as one that is di­verse and in­clu­sive, val­ues em­ploy­ees who are adapt­able, col­lab­o­ra­tive and high-im­pact com­mu­ni­ca­tors with dig­i­tal skills, and is en­abled by com­mu­ni­ca­tions and tech­nol­ogy in­fras­truc­ture and tools.</p>
    <p>When the dust of re­shap­ing of sup­ply chains and re­mote oper­a­tions set­tles, it will be time to make tough fi­nan­cial de­ci­sions.</p>
    <p>BE­ING AG­ILE IS WAY OF FU­TURE</p>
    <p>Pro­tect­ing peo­ple and as­sets will un­der­stand­ably be crit­i­cal, but all de­ci­sions about an over­all peo­ple strat­egy should now fo­cus on trans­form­ing into an ag­ile work­force.</p>
    <p>An ag­ile model of work, where com­pa­nies can quickly reskill or re­or­gan­ise their work­force based on mar­ket de­mands, will not only keep busi­nesses alive but also en­sure that the econ­omy pro­gresses.</p>
    <p>In our re­cent sur­vey, we found that the Covid-19 cri­sis has pushed a large ma­jor­ity of Sin­ga­pore com­pa­nies (84 per cent) to eval­u­ate staff be­yond their cur­rent roles and look closely at their po­ten­tial, ca­pa­bil­ity and, most im­por­tantly, adapt­abil­ity to change.</p>
    <p>But it is con­cern­ing that the ques­tion of specif­i­cally how an or­gan­i­sa­tion can be­come ag­ile is still be­ing pon­dered on by business lead­ers. This gap be­tween un­der­stand­ing the need and know­ing how to ad­dress the need was found to be con­sis­tent across industries in our sur­vey.</p>
    <p>The work­force agility gap, be­tween what em­ploy­ees can han­dle to­day ver­sus what will be re­quired of them in the near fu­ture, will be a chal­lenge for many com­pa­nies in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>The best way for­ward in pro­tect­ing peo­ple is match­ing cur­rent in-house tal­ent to the chang­ing needs of the fu­ture, and reskilling the work­force in the right way. Buy­ing skills-in-de­mand from the mar­ket is of­ten too late, too few and too ex­pen­sive.</p>
    <p>Many of our clients in Asia say they recog­nise that work­force agility and or­gan­i­sa­tion cul­ture are in­sep­a­ra­ble.</p>
    <p>We are now wit­ness­ing sev­eral Asian com­pa­nies with tra­di­tional cul­tures mov­ing to flat­ter struc­tures, with more col­lab­o­ra­tive and ex­per­i­men­tal op­er­at­ing styles.</p>
    <p>As­sess­ing liq­uid­ity and analysing risks will en­able busi­nesses to make the best de­ci­sions that pro­tect the bal­ance sheet.</p>
    <p>An­other key im­pact area will be to en­hance or in­crease rev­enue.</p>
    <p>Be­ing able to pivot business mod­els and serve cus­tomers in new ways or ad­just value propo­si­tions will also go a long way in help­ing com­pa­nies to keep rev­enues com­ing.</p>
    <p>Com­pa­nies that have good gov­er­nance, along with ac­cess to rel­e­vant data, will be well placed to find ad­di­tional cash flow and cost sav­ings. Fi­nally, as busi­nesses as­sess their cap­i­tal in­vest­ment strate­gies, it will be worth­while to re­visit long-term am­bi­tions for mergers and acquisitio­ns and di­vest un­der­per­form­ing com­pa­nies.</p>
    <p>Busi­nesses in Sin­ga­pore are ac­tively prepar­ing for the fu­ture of work.</p>
    <p>The way to quick mar­ket adap­ta­tion is achiev­ing the right mix of tech­nol­ogy and hu­man cap­i­tal.</p>
    <p>An in­creas­ing skills mismatch, along­side a wide range of tech­nol­ogy tools to choose from, has made the is­sue of work­force agility that much more com­plex.</p>
    <p>When all is said and done, it will be Sin­ga­pore busi­nesses’ com­mit­ment to a larger pur­pose and am­bi­tion that will keep us, and the econ­omy, grow­ing.</p>
