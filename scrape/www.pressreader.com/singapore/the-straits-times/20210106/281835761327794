    <p>LON­DON • Bri­tish Prime Min­is­ter Boris John­son on Mon­day or­dered Eng­land into a new na­tional lock­down to try to slow a surge in Covid-19 cases that threat­ens to over­whelm parts of the health sys­tem be­fore a vac­ci­na­tion pro­gramme reaches a crit­i­cal mass.</p>
    <p>Mr John­son said a new, more con­ta­gious vari­ant of the coro­n­avirus was spread­ing at great speed and ur­gent ac­tion was needed to slow it down.</p>
    <p>“As I speak to you tonight, our hos­pi­tals are un­der more pres­sure from Covid than any time since the start of the pan­demic,” Mr John­son said in a tele­vised ad­dress to the coun­try, as he ditched his re­gional ap­proach to fight­ing the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>“With most of the coun­try al­ready un­der ex­treme mea­sures, it’s clear that we need to do more to­gether to bring this new vari­ant un­der con­trol.</p>
    <p>“We must there­fore go into a na­tional lock­down which is tough enough to con­tain this vari­ant. That means the gov­ern­ment is</p>
    <p>once again in­struct­ing you to stay at home.”</p>
    <p>Mr John­son said the mea­sures would in­clude school clo­sures from yes­ter­day and rules re­quir­ing most peo­ple to stay at home apart from es­sen­tial shop­ping, ex­er­cise and other lim­ited ex­cep­tions.</p>
    <p>He said if the timetable of the vac­ci­na­tion pro­gramme went as planned and the num­ber of cases and deaths re­sponded to the lock­down mea­sures as ex­pected, it should be pos­si­ble to start mov­ing out of lock­down by the mid­dle of next month.</p>
    <p>How­ever, he urged cau­tion about the timetable.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, Mr John­son can­celled a planned trip to In­dia later this month, cit­ing the need to over­see the pan­demic re­sponse at home.</p>
    <p>As Bri­tain grap­ples with the world’s sixth-high­est death toll and cases hit a new high, the coun­try’s chief med­i­cal of­fi­cers said the spread of Covid-19 risked over­whelm­ing parts of the health sys­tem within 21 days.</p>
    <p>The surge in cases has been driven by the new vari­ant of Covid-19, of­fi­cials say.</p>
    <p>Mr John­son’s gov­ern­ment ear­lier touted a sci­en­tific “tri­umph” as Bri­tain be­came the first coun­try in the world to start vac­ci­nat­ing its pop­u­la­tion with the Covid-19 shot by Ox­ford Univer­sity and As­traZeneca.</p>
    <p>Dial­y­sis pa­tient Brian Pinker, 82, on Mon­day re­ceived the first vac­ci­na­tion out­side of a trial.</p>
    <p>“I am so pleased to be get­ting the Covid vac­cine to­day and re­ally proud that it is one that was in­vented in Ox­ford,” said the re­tired main­te­nance man­ager, just a few hun­dred me­tres from where the vac­cine was de­vel­oped.</p>
    <p>But even with the vac­cines be­ing rolled out, the num­ber of Covid-19 cases and deaths keep ris­ing.</p>
    <p>More than 75,000 peo­ple in the United King­dom have died from Covid-19 within 28 days of a pos­i­tive test since the start of the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>A record 58,784 new cases of the coro­n­avirus were re­ported on Mon­day.</p>
    <p>Mov­ing a few hours ahead of Mr John­son, Scot­tish First Min­is­ter Ni­cola Stur­geon im­posed the most strin­gent lock­down for Scot­land since last spring, which in­cludes clos­ing schools and a ban on leav­ing home for all but ex­er­cise and es­sen­tial shop­ping.</p>
    <p>The de­volved ad­min­is­tra­tion in Wales said all schools and col­leges there should move to on­line learn­ing un­til Jan 18.</p>
    <p>Ms Stur­geon said the new vari­ant ac­counted for nearly half of new cases in Scot­land and is 70 per cent more trans­mis­si­ble.</p>
    <p>Scots, she said, would be legally re­quired to stay at home this month from mid­night.</p>
    <p>Schools will close for all but the chil­dren of es­sen­tial work­ers.</p>
    <p>As Bri­tain grap­ples with the world’s sixth-high­est death toll and cases hit a new high, the coun­try’s chief med­i­cal of­fi­cers said the spread of Covid-19 risked over­whelm­ing parts of the health sys­tem within 21 days.</p>
