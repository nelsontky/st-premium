    <p>Big­ger ex­hi­bi­tions and con­fer­ences with up to 250 par­tic­i­pants are set to re­turn to Sin­ga­pore, as the Repub­lic seeks to re­vive this once-buoy­ant sec­tor. Or­gan­is­ers will be able to ap­ply to pi­lot such meet­ings, in­cen­tives, con­ven­tions and ex­hi­bi­tions (Mice) events from Oct 1.</p>
    <p>Big­ger ex­hi­bi­tions and con­fer­ences with up to 250 par­tic­i­pants are set to re­turn to Sin­ga­pore, as the Repub­lic seeks to re­vive this once-buoy­ant sec­tor.</p>
    <p>Or­gan­is­ers will be able to ap­ply to pi­lot such meet­ings, in­cen­tives, con­ven­tions and ex­hi­bi­tions (Mice) events from Oct 1.</p>
    <p>Trade and In­dus­try Min­is­ter Chan</p>
    <p>Chun Sing, an­nounc­ing the move yes­ter­day, said that tri­alling events with up to 250 at­ten­dees is in­tended to open the doors to hold­ing events on an even larger scale.</p>
    <p>“We are work­ing with overseas part­ners in­clud­ing overseas event or­gan­is­ers such as Messe Ber­lin to see how we can learn from the ex­pe­ri­ence of other coun­tries scal­ing this up from the hun­dreds to the thou­sands in a safe and sus­tain­able man­ner,” he said.</p>
    <p>The in­crease in the max­i­mum num­ber of at­ten­dees from 50 cur­rently is in line with the grad­ual re­sump­tion of eco­nomic ac­tiv­i­ties in Sin­ga­pore, and it comes af­ter a suc­cess­ful pi­lot last month with up to 50 del­e­gates, the Sin­ga­pore Tourism Board (STB) said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The event, the 2020 IEEE In­ter­na­tional Con­fer­ence on Com­pu­ta­tional Elec­tro­mag­net­ics, was held at Re­sorts World Sen­tosa be­tween Aug 24 and 26.</p>
    <p>With a premium on safety dur­ing the pan­demic, the pi­lot event used colour-coded lan­yards, im­ple­mented stag­gered ar­rival and de­par­ture tim­ings, and put in place in­di­vid­ual plat­ing of meals in­stead of buf­fets, The Straits Times un­der­stands.</p>
    <p>The Mice in­dus­try has been a key driver of Sin­ga­pore’s growth, and there is a strong in­dus­try in­ter­est in and de­mand for busi­ness events, STB noted.</p>
    <p>It said: “The grad­ual re­sump­tion of busi­ness events will help main­tain Sin­ga­pore’s po­si­tion as a lead­ing Mice hub and re­tain crit­i­cal ca­pa­bil­i­ties, while safe­guard­ing jobs and liveli­hoods in the in­dus­try and other re­lated sec­tors.”</p>
    <p>The in­dus­try sup­ported more than 34,000 jobs with an eco­nomic value-add of $3.8 bil­lion, or nearly 1 per cent of Sin­ga­pore’s gross do­mes­tic prod­uct, ac­cord­ing to a sur­vey com­mis­sioned by STB last year.</p>
    <p>Mice busi­ness trav­ellers are also high-yield vis­i­tors who spend close to dou­ble that of leisure trav­ellers.</p>
    <p>Dis­tin­guish­ing be­tween Sin­ga­pore’s Mice in­dus­try and that of other coun­tries, Mr Chan em­pha­sised that Sin­ga­pore caters to the in­ter­na­tional mar­ket and un­like oth­ers, can­not sur­vive on just its do­mes­tic mar­ket.</p>
    <p>“The way we are go­ing to re­vamp the in­dus­try, we have to take into con­sid­er­a­tion how we bring in­ter­na­tional trav­ellers into Sin­ga­pore, con­duct the meet­ing safely, and then even pro­vide them the as­sur­ance (of safety af­ter they depart Sin­ga­pore),” he added, re­fer­ring to it as an “endto-end ser­vice”.</p>
    <p>The trial pro­pos­als will be re­viewed by the STB and the Min­istry of Trade and In­dus­try, and or­gan­is­ers may pro­ceed only upon ob­tain­ing ap­proval from the min­istry.</p>
    <p>Or­gan­is­ers must demon­strate abil­ity to im­ple­ment safe man­age­ment mea­sures, which in­clude lim­it­ing over­all den­sity of at­ten­dees and hav­ing in­fec­tion con­trol mea­sures be­fore and af­ter the event.</p>
    <p>Fur­ther de­tails on the ap­pli­ca­tion process for event or­gan­is­ers and safe man­age­ment mea­sures that they need to im­ple­ment will be re­leased at a later stage.</p>
    <p>Among the pi­lot events tak­ing place un­der the ex­panded at­tendee ca­pac­ity is the Sin­ga­pore In­ter­na­tional En­ergy Week Con­fer­ence, which is sched­uled to be held in a hy­brid for­mat at Ma­rina Bay Sands from Oct 26 to 30.</p>
    <p>In ad­di­tion, the Sin­ga­pore As­so­ci­a­tion of Con­ven­tion and Ex­hi­bi­tion Or­gan­is­ers and Sup­pli­ers is col­lab­o­rat­ing with gov­ern­ment agen­cies STB and En­ter­prise Sin­ga­pore on a road map to pro­vide guide­lines on safety mea­sures and best prac­tices for busi­ness events. This road map will be launched later this month.</p>
    <p>A travel in­surance prod­uct for in­bound trav­ellers to cover crit­i­cal Covid-19 re­lated ex­penses is also in the works and will be avail­able by the fourth quar­ter of this year, STB said.</p>
    <p>In­creas­ing the ca­pac­ity for Mice (meet­ings, in­cen­tives, con­fer­ences and ex­hi­bi­tions) events will pro­vide a much-needed boost to the badly hit Mice and tourism sec­tor, in­dus­try play­ers say.</p>
    <p>Event or­gan­is­ers can ap­ply to hold events with up to 250 del­e­gates, up from a max­i­mum of 50 at­ten­dees, from next month, the Sin­ga­pore Tourism Board an­nounced yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Mr Ed­ward Liu, group man­ag­ing di­rec­tor of busi­ness events man­age­ment firm CEMS, said yes­ter­day’s an­nounce­ment is a good move and a sign of the Gov­ern­ment’s con­fi­dence over how the virus sit­u­a­tion is play­ing out here.</p>
    <p>While Mice events are un­likely to re­sume im­me­di­ately, given that they usu­ally need a ges­ta­tion pe­riod of about six months, the an­nounce­ment will be a boost nonethe­less, he said.</p>
    <p>“There will al­ways be in­ter­est in ex­hi­bi­tions and con­fer­ences. The more events we can hold, the more vi­brant our econ­omy will be.”</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore As­so­ci­a­tion of Con­ven­tion and Ex­hi­bi­tion Or­gan­is­ers and Sup­pli­ers pres­i­dent Aloysius Arlando said the move of­fers en­cour­age­ment and hope to the in­dus­try.</p>
    <p>“The an­nounce­ment is cer­tainly a wel­come move, and we of course hope that through the pi­lots that are to come, they will give us greater or richer data points and in­sights for us to open up the in­dus­try to even larger-scale events and, when travel and bor­der re­stric­tions are re­laxed, to wel­come in­ter­na­tional vis­i­tors back to our events in Sin­ga­pore,” he said.</p>
    <p>Mr Don Tsai, project di­rec­tor of events man­age­ment firm First Wave Agency, said that al­low­ing pi­lot events with up to 250 at­ten­dees is im­por­tant for an in­dus­try which saw al­most all its firms tak­ing a nose­dive af­ter Covid-19 hit.</p>
    <p>Re­fer­ring to busi­ness dis­cus­sions in the last few months, he said: “There was a lot of con­ver­sa­tion, but there was lit­tle busi­ness dur­ing that pe­riod, with maybe 10 to 20 per cent of busi­ness con­ver­sion in terms of events go­ing vir­tual.”</p>
    <p>The an­nounce­ment serves a sec­ondary pur­pose of let­ting peo­ple around the world know that Sin­ga­pore is restart­ing busi­ness, and that gives clients con­fi­dence when firms talk to them to plan fu­ture events, Mr Tsai added.</p>
    <p>As part of moves to bol­ster the in­dus­try, the Al­liance for Ac­tion on En­abling Safe and In­no­va­tive Vis­i­tor Ex­pe­ri­ences, one of the coali­tions con­vened by the Emerg­ing Stronger task force, has worked closely with in­dus­try stake­hold­ers and gov­ern­ment agen­cies to ex­plore new ways to fa­cil­i­tate safe and in­no­va­tive ex­pe­ri­ences for vis­i­tors amid the Covid-19 pan­demic.</p>
    <p>The al­liance has de­vel­oped a pro­to­type for safe trade shows and ex­hi­bi­tions, which are larger events that would not have been per­mit­ted to re­sume in their orig­i­nal for­mat. This pro­to­type will be tested at a few trade shows, start­ing with new trade show Trav­elRe­vive in Novem­ber.</p>
    <p>The al­liance has also de­signed safe itin­er­ar­ies, which could in­clude leisure ac­tiv­i­ties like small­group pri­vate tours around Sin­ga­pore with concierge-like services, which will be of­fered to the Trav­elRe­vive del­e­gates.</p>
    <p>Ms Jean Wang, chair­man of the So­ci­ety of Tourist Guides Sin­ga­pore, said that with the lengths that busi­ness trav­ellers would prob­a­bly have to go to in or­der to come to Sin­ga­pore, they could pos­si­bly look to ex­tend their stay and do more sightseein­g than most Mice trav­ellers usu­ally would be­fore Covid-19, when they tended to leave shortly af­ter their events ended.</p>
    <p>“Now, they may be en­cour­aged to stay here for a longer pe­riod, and that could be a good op­por­tu­nity for us,” she said.</p>
    <p>Com­pared with be­fore Covid-19, when tour guides fo­cused on pro­vid­ing in­for­ma­tive com­men­tary on places vis­ited, they are now re­quired to be more like co­or­di­na­tors for tourists and vis­i­tors, Ms Wang added.</p>
    <p>This in­cludes mak­ing sure vis­i­tors ad­here to con­tact trac­ing pro­ce­dures and com­ply with other safety re­quire­ments when they leave and re­turn to their ho­tels, she said.</p>
    <p>WEL­COME FIRST STEP</p>
    <p>The an­nounce­ment is cer­tainly a wel­come move, and we of course hope that through the pi­lots that are to come, they will give us greater or richer data points and in­sights for us to open up the in­dus­try to even larger-scale events and, when travel and bor­der re­stric­tions are re­laxed, to wel­come in­ter­na­tional vis­i­tors back to our events in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>MR ALOYSIUS ARLANDO, pres­i­dent of the Sin­ga­pore As­so­ci­a­tion of Con­ven­tion and Ex­hi­bi­tion Or­gan­is­ers and Sup­pli­ers, who said the move of­fers en­cour­age­ment and hope to the in­dus­try.</p>
