    <p>•</p>
    <p>It has been three weeks since Ron­ald Koe­man va­cated his po­si­tion as Nether­lands coach to take up the reins at Barcelona.</p>
    <p>The Oranje, how­ever, have yet to name his per­ma­nent suc­ces­sor and the un­cer­tainty was telling on Mon­day as the list­less Dutch fell to their first de­feat in eight games since los­ing to Euro­pean cham­pi­ons Por­tu­gal in the Na­tions League fi­nal in June last year.</p>
    <p>In­ter Mi­lan mid­fielder Ni­colo Barella scored the win­ner, head­ing home in first-half stop­page time, as Italy claimed a 1-0 away vic­tory in Am­s­ter­dam, though it was tinged by the news that Ni­colo Zan­iolo suf­fered an­other torn an­te­rior cru­ci­ate lig­a­ment in­jury.</p>
    <p>The Roma mid­fielder spent six months on the side­lines last sea­son af­ter pick­ing up the same prob­lem.</p>
    <p>How­ever, the Az­zurri, who are now un­beaten i n their past 16 games go­ing back to 2018, now oc­cupy top spot in Group A1 with four points from two games, one point clear of the Dutch, who were play­ing their sec­ond game un­der in­terim coach Dwight Lodeweges.</p>
    <p>On whether he would still be in charge for next month’s Na­tions League con­tests, away to Bos­nia and Herze­gov­ina and Italy, the 62-year-old urged the Dutch Foot­ball As­so­ci­a­tion to shed some clar­ity soon.</p>
    <p>“That de­pends on the board. I have no idea. I was sup­posed to take over for now,” he said.</p>
    <p>“If there’s no new man­ager, they might ask me to help them out again. I’ll wait and see.</p>
    <p>“The big­gest prob­lem be­fore half­time was that we were too far apart. Their dy­nam­ics forced us to make de­ci­sions all the time.</p>
    <p>“We lost to a very good team, a top op­po­nent who ba­si­cally does the same things as we do, but per­formed much bet­ter.</p>
    <p>“We didn’t help each other enough in the first half. Just run­ning very fast and work­ing very hard is not enough. When we won pos­ses­sion of the ball, we were not fresh. The spa­ces were too big.”</p>
    <p>The longer the Dutch take to bring in a recog­nised top coach, the more they risk throw­ing away the progress Koe­man made in help­ing the team qual­ify for the post­poned Euro 2020 – their first ma­jor tour­na­ment since miss­ing out on Euro 2016 and the 2018 World Cup.</p>
    <p>For­mer Manch­ester United man­ager Louis van Gaal has ex­pressed an in­ter­est in com­ing out of re­tire­ment to man­age the team, who he took to the 2014 World Cup semi-fi­nals.</p>
    <p>But ac­cord­ing to Dutch foot­ball mag­a­zine Voet­bal In­ter­na­tional, the play­ers’ coun­cil, com­pris­ing cap­tain Vir­gil van Dijk, Kevin St­root­man, Ryan Ba­bel, Matthijs de Ligt and Da­ley Blind, have re­port­edly nom­i­nated for­mer Ajax Am­s­ter­dam coach Henk ten Cate as their No. 1 choice.</p>
    <p>In Belfast, Er­ling Braut Haa­land and Alexan­der Sor­loth scored twice each as Nor­way thrashed North­ern Ire­land 5-1 to hand Ian Bar­a­clough a hum­bling home de­but as man­ager.</p>
