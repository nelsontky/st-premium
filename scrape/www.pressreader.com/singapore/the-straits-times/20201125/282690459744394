    <p>(Hu­nan) • Like many men his age, Mr Peng Guofei is a dot­ing grand­fa­ther.</p>
    <p>Un­like his peers, the 75-year-old is also an avid live streamer who has gar­nered In­ter­net fame i n China.</p>
    <p>“I’m ‘ Xiangxi Grandpa Fei’ to ev­ery­one on the In­ter­net,” the farmer told Xin­hua at his home in Yangmu Vil­lage, in Xiangxi Tu­jia and Miao au­ton­o­mous pre­fec­ture in cen­tral China’s Hu­nan prov­ince.</p>
    <p>Dis­cussing so­cial is­sues, in­tro­duc­ing tourist at­trac­tions and tout­ing lo­cal spe­cial­i­ties, Mr Peng has at­tracted 161,000 fol­low­ers on his Douyin ac­count – the Chi­nese ver­sion of Tik­Tok – with more than</p>
    <p>100 mil­lion views and 3.45 mil­lion likes as of mid-Novem­ber.</p>
    <p>His home town, lo­cated deep in a moun­tain­ous area, had a high poverty rate of 40.5 per cent in 2014, but the vil­lage was lifted out</p>
    <p>of poverty last year, with the rate fall­ing to 0.33 per cent.</p>
    <p>With the help of lo­cal of­fi­cials, vil­lagers re­ceived In­ter­net ac­cess due to 4G sig­nal cov­er­age in the vil­lage.</p>
    <p>The lo­cal of­fi­cials also turned to live-streaming e-com­merce in a bid to help vil­lagers raise their in­come. They in­vited me­dia pro­fes­sion­als late last year to start a livestream­ing train­ing class for vil­lagers.</p>
    <p>Mr Peng signed up for the class when he heard the news.</p>
    <p>“He told us he’d like to be an In­ter­net celebrity,” said Mr Dai Hai­wen, a party cadre of the vil­lage.</p>
    <p>“Al­though Mr Peng was the old­est per­son tak­ing the course, he was very ac­tive in class and had a strong in­ter­est in new things.”</p>
    <p>Early this year, Mr Peng took the course con­ducted in the vil­lage and was pre­sented with a smart phone. He set up the ac­count “Xiangxi Grandpa Fei” on Douyin af­ter tak­ing the one-month course, tak­ing the first step to be­come a live streamer.</p>
    <p>He also went on a learn­ing trip to the pro­vin­cial cap­i­tal of Changsha in May, the first time he left the moun­tains of Xiangxi.</p>
    <p>Mr Peng built up a team in Septem­ber to make short videos sell­ing agri­cul­tural prod­ucts on­line. Their videos re­ceived many likes due to the en­gag­ing content.</p>
    <p>“More peo­ple will know about my home town’s spe­cial prod­ucts through my In­ter­net fame,” said Mr Peng.</p>
    <p>“The live-streaming ses­sions are a chan­nel for us to at­tract cus­tomers and make some profits.”</p>
