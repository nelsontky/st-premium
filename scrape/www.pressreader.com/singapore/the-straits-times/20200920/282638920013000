    <p>In late March, just a cou­ple of weeks be­fore the cir­cuit breaker started, the Blue Lo­tus Kitchen + Bar in Alexan­dra Road was re­branded as Opio Kitchen + Bar.</p>
    <p>The change was to dis­tin­guish the Western eatery from its other restau­rant in the group, Blue Lo­tus Chi­nese Eat­ing House in Sen­tosa Cove. A third out­let – Blue Lo­tus Grill House in Tan­jong Pa­gar – had closed ear­lier this year.</p>
    <p>Phys­i­cally, lit­tle has changed. The restau­rant looks the same with its mix of in­door and al­fresco seat­ing amid lush plants in a quiet en­clave of of­fices at the junc­tion of Alexan­dra Road and Telok Blan­gah Road.</p>
    <p>What has been re­vamped is the menu. The cook­ing style is still Western, but there is now a strong Asian el­e­ment in many of the dishes.</p>
    <p>The grill is put to good use with a se­lec­tion of meats and seafood. The chef has also added seafood boils, with sauces such as white pep­per­corn and as­sam but­ter, all priced quite at­trac­tively.</p>
    <p>White clams, for ex­am­ple, cost $24 for 700g while king prawns are $28 for 500g. A Seafood Combo bag – with crab, green lip mus­sels, white clams and king prawns – costs $78.</p>
    <p>I would not say the new con­cept works bet­ter, but if you were a fan of the pre­vi­ous restau­rant, chances are, you will be happy with the cook­ing. The chef does not go too crazy with the fu­sion, so flavours stay fa­mil­iar even if the com­bi­na­tions are new.</p>
