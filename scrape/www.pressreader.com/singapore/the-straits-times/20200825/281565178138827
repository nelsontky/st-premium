    <p>As Sin­ga­pore con­tin­ues to open its bor­ders grad­u­ally, the stay-home no­tice (SHN) regime has be­come a key part of keep­ing Covid-19 in­fec­tions low in the com­mu­nity. More than 120,400 such no­tices have been is­sued in the past six months, the au­thor­i­ties said. Early this month, there were about 14,000 peo­ple still serv­ing out their SHNs.</p>
    <p>As Sin­ga­pore con­tin­ues to open its bor­ders grad­u­ally, the stay-home no­tice (SHN) regime has be­come a key part of keep­ing Covid-19 in­fec­tions low in the com­mu­nity.</p>
    <p>More than 120,400 such no­tices have been is­sued in the past six months, the au­thor­i­ties said in re­sponse to The Straits Times’ queries.</p>
    <p>Early this month, there were about 14,000 peo­ple still serv­ing their SHNs, said an Im­mi­gra­tion and Check­points Author­ity spokesman. He added that some 200 in­ves­ti­ga­tions into breaches have been con­ducted as at Aug 4.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing the SHN pe­riod, typ­i­cally for 14 days, an in­di­vid­ual is not al­lowed to leave his res­i­dence. Those who break the rules face a $10,000 fine, jail of up to six months, or both.</p>
    <p>For­eign­ers could also have the va­lid­ity of per­mits or passes al­low­ing them to re­main in Sin­ga­pore short­ened or re­voked.</p>
    <p>The SHN was in­tro­duced on Feb 19 for those re­turn­ing from any­where in China ex­cept Hubei. At the time, those who had trav­elled to the prov­ince – then the epi­cen­tre of the pan­demic – were quar­an­tined.</p>
    <p>As the coro­n­avirus spread and the sit­u­a­tion wors­ened glob­ally, the Govern­ment ex­panded the scheme to re­turnees from other coun­tries, and con­verted var­i­ous sites like ho­tels into ded­i­cated fa­cil­i­ties for hous­ing th­ese re­turnees. By April 9, all trav­ellers re­turn­ing from any­where overseas had to serve SHNs at such sites.</p>
    <p>Al­though not all in­com­ing trav­ellers have to stay at ded­i­cated sites now, a spokesman for the Min­istry of Na­tional Devel­op­ment said ear­lier this month that 46 ho­tels were still be­ing used for such pur­poses.</p>
    <p>Travel rules have been re­laxed grad­u­ally as Covid-19 num­bers have come un­der con­trol. For ex­am­ple, from next month, vis­i­tors from coun­tries like Malaysia and China need to serve only seven days of SHN. Vis­i­tors who had been in Brunei or New Zealand – con­sid­ered low-risk coun­tries – for 14 con­sec­u­tive days be­fore their visit will not have to serve the SHN at all.</p>
    <p>Ms Tan Yen Nee, ho­tel and sec­tor man­power di­rec­tor at the Sin­ga­pore Tourism Board, said a range of ac­com­mo­da­tion op­tions are avail­able for trav­ellers to serve their SHNs, sub­ject to cur­rent rules.</p>
    <p>“The Govern­ment will con­tinue to mon­i­tor the dy­namic and evolv­ing Covid-19 sit­u­a­tion, and ad­just our ca­pac­ity ac­cord­ingly,” she said.</p>
    <p>Among the ded­i­cated sites is Shangri-La’s Rasa Sen­tosa Re­sort and Spa, the site of Sin­ga­pore’s first Covid-19 case, re­ported on Jan 23. The ho­tel has been used as an SHN ded­i­cated fa­cil­ity since March.</p>
    <p>Shangri-La Group told ST the ho­tel’s op­er­at­ing ar­range­ments are made in close con­sul­ta­tion with and ap­proved by the au­thor­i­ties. Th­ese in­clude no phys­i­cal in­ter­ac­tion be­tween staff and guests, daily tem­per­a­ture checks, and making sure meals are de­liv­ered and linen changed in a safe man­ner.</p>
    <p>It has also cre­ated videos such as ex­er­cise and dance lessons as well as on­line meet-up ses­sions for guests to i nter­act vir­tu­ally, and calls SHN guests daily to check on their well-be­ing.</p>
    <p>Ho­tels not be­ing used as ded­i­cated sites have also been ac­cept­ing SHN guests. Mr Arthur Kiong, chief ex­ec­u­tive of Far East Hos­pi­tal­ity, said it has three ho­tels – Oa­sia Ho­tel Down­town, Or­chard Ren­dezvous Ho­tel and Vil­lage Ho­tel Bugis – do­ing so, in ad­di­tion to sev­eral ser­viced res­i­dences.</p>
    <p>Th­ese ho­tels fol­low the au­thor­i­ties’ strict reg­u­la­tions on safety mea­sures and op­er­a­tions, he said, from the guest’s ar­rival and meals to house­keep­ing and proper dis­in­fec­tion when the guest leaves.</p>
    <p>Most for­eign stu­dents re­turn­ing to Sin­ga­pore serve their SHNs at ded­i­cated sites, said a Min­istry of Ed­u­ca­tion (MOE) spokesman, adding that oth­ers do so in ac­com­mo­da­tion they have found for them­selves or in min­istry-man­aged hos­tels.</p>
    <p>Since Aug 11, the au­thor­i­ties have started us­ing wear­able tech­nol­ogy to mon­i­tor trav­ellers not stay­ing at ded­i­cated sites while serv­ing their SHNs. Such trav­ellers must wear an elec­tronic wrist­band that alerts the au­thor­i­ties if the wearer leaves his res­i­dence. Of­fi­cials have said the tech­nol­ogy is nec­es­sary to make sure the SHN regime re­mains sus­tain­able and ef­fec­tive.</p>
    <p>Chil­dren aged 12 and below do not need to wear such de­vices. Nei­ther do stu­dents stay­ing in school hos­tels as they are closely ob­served.</p>
    <p>The MOE spokesman had said ear­lier this month that it ex­pected fewer than 100 stu­dents would need to wear the de­vices in the first two weeks af­ter the new rule kicked in. “How­ever, this num­ber may grow as Sin­ga­pore grad­u­ally opens its bor­ders,” she added.</p>
