    <p>For the past three years, Ms Junette Yu has soaked up the yearend fes­tiv­i­ties and in­dulged in Thanks­giv­ing din­ner with dif­fer­ent Amer­i­can fam­i­lies.</p>
    <p>This Thanks­giv­ing, the 22-yearold post­grad­u­ate stu­dent at Duke Univer­sity in North Carolina sat out the cel­e­bra­tions and stayed at home. Wary that so­cial gath­er­ings and crowds could fuel the spread of Covid-19, Ms Yu also gave the Black Fri­day sales a miss.</p>
    <p>In past years, she joined the fam­i­lies of her Amer­i­can class­mates, and last year, she cel­e­brated with the host fam­ily she was matched with in a pro­gramme for in­ter­na­tional stu­dents.</p>
    <p>“I re­ally liked meet­ing host fam­i­lies reg­u­larly be­cause it was a chance to ex­pe­ri­ence Amer­i­can cul­ture be­yond the univer­sity,” she said. “Un­for­tu­nately, that is not go­ing to hap­pen this year.”</p>
    <p>Covid-19 cases in North Carolina, where she has been for five years, hit a record high of 4,514 daily cases on Nov 22. Its gov­er­nor man­dated the wear­ing of masks state-wide from last Wed­nes­day to Dec 11. On Sun­day, the Amer­i­can state re­ported 3,820 cases.</p>
    <p>“My con­cern is that busi­nesses and stores will start shut­ting down, and there will be panic buy­ing again. Right now, there are no signs of that, but I can see how that can be a prob­lem when num­bers start ris­ing,” Ms Yu said.</p>
    <p>Hav­ing de­cided to dis­tance her­self so­cially, she planned to bake hol­i­day treats with her house­mates. “My friends and I mes­saged one an­other ear­lier in the week and tried to fig­ure out if there are safe ac­tiv­i­ties to do to­gether for Thanks­giv­ing, but we couldn’t re­ally come up with any­thing.”</p>
