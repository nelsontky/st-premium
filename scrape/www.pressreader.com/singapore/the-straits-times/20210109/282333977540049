    <p>For­eign spouses of Sin­ga­pore ci­ti­zens should have ac­cess to so­cial as­sis­tance schemes and ben­e­fits, the As­so­ci­a­tion of Women for Ac­tion and Re­search (Aware) said yes­ter­day, on one of the goals it hopes to see achieved this year.</p>
    <p>Mi­grant spouses make up a core part of Sin­ga­pore so­ci­ety, hav­ing es­tab­lished fam­ily ties here and con­trib­uted to the na­tion through their labour both within the house­hold and the work­force, it said.</p>
    <p>There should also be clear paths and time­lines to per­ma­nent res­i­dency and cit­i­zen­ship for such spouses, Aware said in its wish list for this year’s Bud­get that it sub­mit­ted to the Gov­ern­ment yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The gen­der-equal­ity ad­vo­cacy group said ex­clud­ing mi­grant spouses from ben­e­fits and so­cial as­sis­tance could trap their fam­i­lies in a cy­cle of poverty and per­pet­u­ate gen­der in­equal­ity, as many tend to be for­eign women mar­ried to lower-in­come Sin­ga­porean men.</p>
    <p>Aware also sug­gested that self­em­ploy­ment be al­lowed for mi­grant spouses, cit­ing it as a way for transna­tional fam­i­lies to al­le­vi­ate their fi­nan­cial bur­dens.</p>
    <p>Cur­rently, many mi­grant spouses do not au­to­mat­i­cally have the right to work in Sin­ga­pore. Those who do not qual­ify for em­ploy­ment-based passes such as work passes must be spon­sored by their Sin­ga­porean spouses for a long-term visit pass (LTVP) or Long-Term Visit Pass-Plus (LTVP+).</p>
    <p>These passes al­low them to ap­ply for a let­ter of con­sent from po­ten­tial em­ploy­ers, which is needed be­fore they can work. Self-em­ploy­ment is not al­lowed.</p>
    <p>Aware rec­om­mended that the Gov­ern­ment al­low self-em­ploy­ment for LTVP and LTVP+ hold­ers.</p>
    <p>It said the flex­i­bil­ity of self-em­ploy­ment would also ben­e­fit mi­grant moth­ers who need to bal­ance earn­ing an in­come with rais­ing chil­dren.</p>
    <p>The group’s other rec­om­men­da­tions in­clude sev­eral it made for last year’s Bud­get, such as a call to in­tro­duce a pi­lot univer­sal ba­sic in­come scheme or a care­giver sup­port grant to pro­vide a monthly in­come for those car­ing for older fam­ily mem­bers, as well as a manda­tory paid el­der­care leave scheme.</p>
    <p>“While Covid-19 has changed all of our lives in some form or an­other, the pan­demic’s im­pact through­out so­ci­ety has not been equal,” Ms Shailey Hingorani, Aware’s head of re­search and ad­vo­cacy, said in a state­ment urg­ing pol­i­cy­mak­ers to pay more at­ten­tion to the bur­den of fi­nan­cial in­se­cu­rity and care­giv­ing labour that dis­pro­por­tion­ately falls on women.</p>
    <p>She said: “As we pre­pare to fu­ture-proof Sin­ga­pore ci­ti­zens against eco­nomic dis­rup­tions, we must se­ri­ously con­sider pro­vid­ing an in­come floor for all.”</p>
