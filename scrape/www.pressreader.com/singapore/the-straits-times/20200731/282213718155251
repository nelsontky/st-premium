    <p>LOS AN­GE­LES • Young play­ers have been phys­i­cally abused and left with­out school­ing at Na­tional Basketball As­so­ci­a­tion (NBA) acad­e­mies in China, which were de­scribed as “sweat camp(s) for ath­letes”, an ESPN report said.</p>
    <p>Mul­ti­ple Amer­i­can coaches have com­plained about phys­i­cal pun­ish­ment at the acad­e­mies in­clud­ing a fa­cil­ity i n Xin­jiang, the re­gion where China is ac­cused of hold­ing more than a mil­lion mem­bers of eth­nic mi­nori­ties in in­tern­ment camps. The NBA said it cut ties last year with Xin­jiang, but con­tin­ues to op­er­ate acad­e­mies in Shan­dong and Zhe­jiang prov­inces, in fa­cil­i­ties run by the Chi­nese govern­ment.</p>
    <p>One for­mer coach said he saw a Chi­nese coun­ter­part hurl a ball into a young player’s face and “kick him in the gut” ac­cord­ing to the ESPN in­ves­ti­ga­tion.</p>
    <p>“Imag­ine you have a kid who’s 13, 14 years old, and you’ve got a grown coach who is 40 years old hit­ting your kid,” the coach was quoted as say­ing. “We’re part of that. The NBA is part of that.”</p>
    <p>NBA deputy com­mis­sioner Mark Ta­tum told ESPN only a “hand­ful” of com­plaints about abuse had been re­ceived and of­fi­cials in the league’s New York of­fice, in­clud­ing com­mis­sioner Adam Sil­ver, were not aware of broad mis­treat­ment of play­ers.</p>
    <p>He added the league is “re-eval­u­at­ing” the academy pro­gramme.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to the NBA Academy web­site, play­ers in these acad­e­mies range from 14-18 years old.</p>
    <p>“One of the lessons we’ve learned here is that we do need to have more di­rect over­sight and the abil­ity to make staffing changes when ap­pro­pri­ate,” Ta­tum said.</p>
    <p>“We don’t have over­sight of the lo­cal coaches, of the aca­demic pro­grammes or the liv­ing con­di­tions. It’s fair to say we were less in­volved than we wanted to be.”</p>
    <p>The report comes at a time of fraught re­la­tions be­tween the NBA and China. State broad­caster CCTV stopped screen­ing NBA games last year after Hous­ton Rock­ets gen­eral man­ager Daryl Morey tweeted in sup­port of pro-democ­racy pro­test­ers in Hong Kong.</p>
    <p>The NBA be­gan launch­ing in­ter­na­tional acad­e­mies in 2016, plac­ing three in China with the aim to un­earth the next Yao Ming, the tow­er­ing for­mer Rock­ets cen­tre. But the Chi­nese pro­ject was “fun­da­men­tally flawed” ac­cord­ing to Bruce Palmer, a for­mer tech­ni­cal di­rec­tor at a pri­vate basketball school in China who was hired by the NBA to eval­u­ate the acad­e­mies.</p>
    <p>FUN­DA­MEN­TALLY FLAWED</p>
    <p>We don’t have over­sight of the lo­cal coaches, of the aca­demic pro­grammes or the liv­ing con­di­tions. It’s fair to say we were less in­volved than we wanted to be.</p>
    <p>’’</p>
    <p>MARK TA­TUM, NBA deputy com­mis­sioner ac­knowl­edg­ing the league dropped the ball in run­ning its acad­e­mies in China.</p>
    <p>The main prob­lems were that NBA em­ploy­ees were placed un­der Chi­nese author­ity, and the league was pre­vented from work­ing with China’s elite play­ers, Palmer said.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to ESPN, one coach re­quested a trans­fer after see­ing Chi­nese coaches hit teenage play­ers, while an­other left be­cause he could not stom­ach the lack of ed­u­ca­tion.</p>
    <p>Ed­u­ca­tion was in­tended as a cen­tral plank of the acad­e­mies, but no for­mal school­ing was pro­vided by the Chi­nese sport bu­reaus, the report said. It de­tailed cramped liv­ing con­di­tions at the Xin­jiang academy, where rooms meant for two play­ers were ac­com­mo­dat­ing up to 10, sleep­ing in bunk beds.</p>
    <p>Play­ers trained two or three times a day, ESPN said, adding that teenagers as young as 13 were of­ten left un­su­per­vised.</p>
