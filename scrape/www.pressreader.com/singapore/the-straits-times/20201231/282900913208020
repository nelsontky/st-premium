    <p>• Top South Korean girl group Black­pink’s Rose and Lisa are fly­ing solo at last.</p>
    <p>Their long-awaited solo ef­forts were announced yes­ter­day by their agency YG En­ter­tain­ment.</p>
    <p>While the com­pany said in June that fel­low band mem­ber Jisoo would also be re­leas­ing her de­but al­bum, it will now be pushed back due to her film­ing com­mit­ments for the drama Snow­drop.</p>
    <p>Of the four mem­bers i n the group, only Jen­nie has re­leased a solo track since they burst onto the scene in Au­gust 2016. Her song Solo was re­leased in 2018 and, since then, fans of Black­pink, also known as Blinks, have been waiting im­pa­tiently for the other mem­bers to come out with solo works as well.</p>
    <p>While there is no of­fi­cial date for the drops yet, they will re­port­edly be­gin film­ing the mu­sic videos soon. There are also no de­tails on what fans can ex­pect from them, mu­sic-wise.</p>
    <p>Rose’s ef­fort will be the first to be re­leased and there is talk that the much-an­tic­i­pated video will be shot next month.</p>
    <p>If their pre­vi­ous video drops are any­thing to go by, the new of­fer­ing will likely cause a stir among their mil­lions of fans. In June, when they re­leased their mu­sic video, How You Like That, it set a record on YouTube when it gar­nered 86.3 mil­lion views in 24 hours.</p>
    <p>The quar­tet are also hard at work re­hears­ing for their on­line con­cert,</p>
    <p>Black­pink: The Show, which will stream on Jan 31 next year. It was post­poned from Dec 27 due to Covid-19 safety pre­cau­tions and re­stric­tions in South Korea.</p>
    <p>It will be their first live-stream con­cert and they have not per­formed in such an event for more than a year.</p>
    <p>It has been a boun­ti­ful year for the group, which took home a slew of awards de­spite the pan­demic cur­tail­ing most of their public per­for­mances.</p>
