    <p>The speedy progress of the front run­ners in the global vac­cine race shows that there is a chance for the Covid-19 pan­demic to end within two years, as World Health Or­gan­i­sa­tion chief Te­dros Ad­hanom Ghe­breye­sus said last week.</p>
    <p>How­ever, the haste to come up with a vac­cine in the global race may en­dan­ger lives if it has not un­der­gone enough test­ing to make sure it is safe and ef­fec­tive.</p>
    <p>And in a cri­sis where the whole world is af­fected, a “me first” ap­proach or vac­cine na­tion­al­ism will not help, no mat­ter how tempt­ing it may be, ex­perts have warned.</p>
    <p>It has been only about eight months since the Covid-19 out­break be­gan, but data from the World Health Or­gan­i­sa­tion shows that 31 vac­cines are in clin­i­cal tri­als, with an­other 142 can­di­date vac­cines in pre-clin­i­cal eval­u­a­tion.</p>
    <p>The num­ber could be higher. Pro­fes­sor Ooi Eng Eong, deputy direc­tor of the Duke-NUS Med­i­cal School’s emerg­ing in­fec­tious dis­eases pro­gramme, said there are al­ready more than 40 vac­cine can­di­dates in clin­i­cal tri­als.</p>
    <p>The speed is mind-blow­ing, con­sid­er­ing vac­cine devel­op­ment is a com­plex, costly and mam­moth task that can take at least five to 10 years.</p>
    <p>Among the front run­ners in the vac­cine race are United States­based Moderna Ther­a­peu­tics and the Na­tional In­sti­tutes of Health with an mRNA vac­cine.</p>
    <p>There is also Bri­tish-Swedish phar­ma­ceu­ti­cal gi­ant As­traZeneca and the Uni­ver­sity of Ox­ford with a vac­cine that uses a chim­panzee ade­n­ovirus vac­cine vec­tor. Ade­n­oviruses are viruses that usu­ally cause the com­mon cold.</p>
    <p>Three other can­di­date vac­cines from China and us­ing in­ac­ti­vated vac­cines are in phase three tri­als.</p>
    <p>This is the stage when large-scale test­ing is done to see if the vac­cine is safe and ef­fec­tive in tens of thou­sands of peo­ple.</p>
    <p>Amer­i­can pharma firm Pfizer is also work­ing on a vac­cine with Ger­man part­ner BioNTech, and said it has en­rolled more than 11,000 vol­un­teers in its trial.</p>
    <p>The type of vac­cines may vary among de­vel­op­ers but they all trick the body into think­ing there is an in­fec­tion so that it will de­velop an­ti­bod­ies and im­mune re­sponses to it.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore’s Duke-NUS Med­i­cal School is part­ner­ing US phar­ma­ceu­ti­cal com­pany Arc­turus Ther­a­peu­tics to de­velop an mRNA vac­cine.</p>
    <p>Clin­i­cal tri­als started here this month.</p>
    <p>Prof Ooi said in late June that the soon­est the vac­cine can be avail­able is about a year later.</p>
    <p>“This very op­ti­mistic time­line re­mains un­changed in my mind,” he said. “We are all work­ing as fast but also as thor­oughly as we can to test the safety and ef­fi­cacy of this vac­cine can­di­date.”</p>
    <p>Re­cently, Dr An­thony Fauci, the well-re­garded head of the Na­tional In­sti­tute of Al­lergy and In­fec­tious Dis­eases in the US, warned against rush­ing out an un­tested vac­cine. He said one po­ten­tial dan­ger is that it would be hard for the other vac­cines to en­rol peo­ple in their tri­als.</p>
    <p>Pro­fes­sor Teo Yik Ying, dean of the Na­tional Uni­ver­sity of Sin­ga­pore’s Saw Swee Hock School of Pub­lic Health, said there is the risk of side ef­fects, in­clud­ing those that may po­ten­tially be life-threat­en­ing, or ac­tu­ally fail to pro­tect the peo­ple against fu­ture Covid-19 in­fec­tions.</p>
    <p>“While th­ese may ap­pear to im­pact only the coun­tries that dis­trib­ute the un­proven vac­cine, the worry is one of global vac­cine hes­i­tancy and vac­cine con­fi­dence.”</p>
    <p>Prof Teo said it is in­evitable that the world will re­port on the emer­gence of side ef­fects or safety lapses as a re­sult of tak­ing th­ese un­proven vac­cines, and this can re­sult in a grow­ing spec­tre in a seg­ment of the pop­u­la­tion against any fu­ture Covid-19 vac­cines.</p>
    <p>To be first is not ev­ery­thing. For one thing, ex­perts have said the first vac­cine may not be the best, and more ef­fec­tive vac­cines may be de­vel­oped later on.</p>
    <p>With so many de­vel­op­ers in the race, it is likely that there will be mul­ti­ple vac­cines in the mar­ket.</p>
    <p>The race also does not end af­ter a vac­cine has been proven to be safe and ef­fec­tive in a phase three trial, as there are many hur­dles be­tween that and mak­ing it avail­able at a clinic. It takes time to scale up pro­duc­tion to man­u­fac­ture bil­lions of doses, and that also de­pends on the avail­abil­ity of bil­lions of glass vials. Ap­provals will also need to be se­cured, and in a timely man­ner.</p>
    <p>Most of the vac­cines will be made in the US and Europe. There is the lo­gis­ti­cal chal­lenge of de­liv­er­ing the vac­cines around the world, as most vac­cines need to be kept sta­ble at low tem­per­a­tures.</p>
    <p>Clearly, there will not be enough sup­plies to go around ini­tially, so it is not as if peo­ple can make a mad dash for a jab. Ex­perts say de­ci­sions will have to be made on which groups will be pri­ori­tised.</p>
    <p>And then, the vac­cines need to be ad­min­is­tered.</p>
    <p>Prof Teo be­lieves the world is aware that a global distri­bu­tion of vac­cines will re­al­is­ti­cally hap­pen only next year.</p>
    <p>“Even if there is an avail­able sup­ply of safe and ef­fec­tive vac­cine for distri­bu­tion at the end of 2020, it will be to se­lected groups of peo­ple, per­haps even in a small num­ber of coun­tries,” said Prof Teo.</p>
    <p>“We do not think that there will be the nec­es­sary five bil­lion doses of vac­cines avail­able for wide­spread distri­bu­tion world­wide by the end of this year.”</p>
    <p>Right now, al­though no Covid-19 vac­cines have been proven to be safe and ef­fec­tive, some coun­tries are al­ready vy­ing to se­cure sup­plies.</p>
    <p>Wealthy coun­tries have struck deals to buy more than two bil­lion doses of vac­cine.</p>
    <p>For now, as the world draws closer to the pos­si­bil­ity of hav­ing a suc­cess­ful vac­cine, the rush to get coun­tries to co­op­er­ate be­comes more ur­gent. Vac­cine ex­perts say it is only with global co­op­er­a­tion that the world can im­prove the chances of de­vel­op­ing a vac­cine and en­sur­ing it is dis­trib­uted eq­ui­tably.</p>
    <p>Just eight months into the Covid-19 pan­demic, two vac­cines have raced through ap­provals and are al­ready in use, al­though ques­tions re­main on whether they are safe and ef­fec­tive. Sev­eral other vac­cine can­di­dates, in­clud­ing four in China, are in the fi­nal phases of test­ing. Joyce Teo and Clara Chong look at those at the front of the pack.</p>
    <p>NO MASS VAC­CI­NA­TIONS THIS YEAR</p>
    <p>Even if there is an avail­able sup­ply of safe and ef­fec­tive vac­cine for distri­bu­tion at the end of 2020, it will be to se­lected groups of peo­ple, per­haps even in a small num­ber of coun­tries... We do not think that there will be the nec­es­sary five bil­lion doses of vac­cines avail­able for wide­spread distri­bu­tion world­wide by the end of this year.</p>
