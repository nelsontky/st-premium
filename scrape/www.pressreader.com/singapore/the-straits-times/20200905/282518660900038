    <p>RACE 1 (1,600M)</p>
    <p>1 Who’s Horse, who caught the eye at the tri­als re­cently, can roll for­ward to lead in what looks like a race which lacks pace.</p>
    <p>5 Joy Mas­ter is an­other who im­pressed at the tri­als. He ap­pears for­ward enough be com­pet­i­tive first-up with Joao Mor­eira up.</p>
    <p>7 Green Gen­er­a­tion has im­proved since drop­ping to Class 5. He can progress fur­ther with the right run. 3 For­tune Pa­trol can come from be­hind and put him­self in con­tention.</p>
    <p>RACE 2 (1,200M)</p>
    <p>3 Tele­com Mis­sile drops to Class 5 for the first time with reign­ing cham­pion Zac Pur­ton astride. With blink­ers on the first time, he is the one to beat.</p>
    <p>1 Ado­nis won the se­cond race on open­ing day last sea­son as Dou­glas Whyte’s first win­ner. He’s look­ing to strike again. 9 E Gen­er­a­tion dis­played plenty of abil­ity over this course and dis­tance last term. A break­through win is not too far away.</p>
    <p>2 Fan­tas­tic Fabio could find the front with Jerry Chau’s 10lb (4.54kg) claim. The value run­ner.</p>
    <p>RACE 3 (1,200M)</p>
    <p>4 All Joy­ful closed off coura­geously on de­but. With im­prove­ment, he could well be the one to beat with with Pur­ton aboard.</p>
    <p>7 Daily Charm was solid on de­but in Grif­fin grade. He has plenty of up­side and has to over­come only the awk­ward draw.</p>
    <p>2 Win­ston’s Lad is look­ing for his third con­sec­u­tive win. He should get the right run from Gate 2.</p>
    <p>5 Colonel will put him­self in the race from the good draw.</p>
    <p>RACE 4 (1,200M)</p>
    <p>7 In­ter­stel­lar is win­less in 13 starts but has shown abil­ity at times. A chance on his re­cent nice trial.</p>
    <p>2 Bright Kid put his best foot for­ward late last sea­son. If he can over­come the wide gate, he’s in with a strong chance.</p>
    <p>4 More Than Enough was an im­pres­sive last-start win­ner. He can do it again based on his re­cent trial. 11 Happy Tango has shown that it is only a mat­ter of time be­fore he scores.</p>
    <p>RACE 5 (1,400M)</p>
    <p>6 Sum­street­sumwhere closed off last sea­son with a strong win for Blake Shinn. The combo looks ca­pa­ble of scor­ing again.</p>
    <p>4 An­gel Of My Eyes se­cured a gritty break­through suc­cess last start. He’s in with a chance again.</p>
    <p>2 Leap Of Faith has drawn awk­wardly in Gate 14 but was an im­pres­sive win­ner last time.</p>
    <p>3 Villa Fionn could be one to run a bold race first-up with Chau’s 10lb claim.</p>
    <p>RACE 6 (1,000M)</p>
    <p>2 Prince Of Gems was solid in a re­cent hit-out. From the in­side gate, he should get all the favours.</p>
    <p>3 Dublin Star is a model of con­sis­tency. If he’s re­turned in good or­der, he rates as a lead­ing player.</p>
    <p>10 Sure Win Win looked sound in a re­cent trial. He looks ready to fire first-up with Pur­ton astride.</p>
    <p>4 He­laku Knight im­proved sharply at the end of last sea­son. With luck, he can make his pres­ence felt from the wide draw.</p>
    <p>RACE 7 (1,000M)</p>
    <p>7 Heart Con­quered was only fair in his de­but sea­son but he ap­pears to have im­proved sharply.</p>
    <p>5 War Of Courage is a two-time win­ner down the Sha Tin straight. On his day, he has a blis­ter­ing turn of foot.</p>
    <p>6 Metro War­rior dis­played steady im­prove­ment across his first four starts in Hong Kong. He war­rants re­spect with Pur­ton’s book­ing.</p>
    <p>2 Al­lied Agility bears close watch­ing with the 7lb claim from Al­fred Chan.</p>
    <p>RACE 8 (1,200M)</p>
    <p>The HKSAR Chief Ex­ec­u­tive’s Cup</p>
    <p>10 Com­puter Patch is ca­pa­ble of test­ing this bunch with the right run with only 117lb on his back.</p>
    <p>1 Wish­ful Thinker moved well in a re­cent trial. With Pur­ton aboard, he should get his chance.</p>
    <p>3 Cham­pion’s Way re­turns to the sprint af­ter his Four-Year-Old Clas­sic Se­ries cam­paign last sea­son, which cul­mi­nated with an 11th in the BMW Hong Kong Derby over 2,000m.</p>
    <p>9 Shin­ing Ace is next best.</p>
    <p>RACE 9 (1,400M)</p>
    <p>5 Re­gency Bo Bo is a five-time win­ner. The in­side draw suits him and he has Pur­ton at the helm.</p>
    <p>14 Per­fect Pair cruised past his ri­vals last start to score by over three lengths. He gets in with only 115lb. 4 Ex­cel­lent Pro­posal grabbed se­cond on his de­but. He seems to have im­proved, go­ing on his re­cent trial. 1 Star Per­for­mance has abil­ity. He shouldn’t be dis­counted with the right run.</p>
    <p>RACE 10 (1,400M)</p>
    <p>7 Bal­lis­tic King is a model of con­sis­tency. He can score if he can over­come the awk­ward draw.</p>
    <p>5 Su­per Wealthy won three on the bounce last sea­son. He ap­pears to have re­turned in ex­cel­lent or­der.</p>
    <p>6 Happy Fun can roll for­ward un­der Pur­ton in an at­tempt to skip away with this con­test.</p>
    <p>8 Beauty Ap­plause is a four-time win­ner from 12 at­tempts. He’s a flashy chest­nut who ap­pears to be on the rise.</p>
