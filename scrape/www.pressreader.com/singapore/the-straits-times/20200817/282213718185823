    <p>In a bid to in­grain dig­i­tal learn­ing be­hav­iour at the work­place, DBS Bank is team­ing up with Ama­zon Web Ser­vices (AWS) to equip about 3,000 em­ploy­ees with ba­sic skills in ar­ti­fi­cial in­tel­li­gence (AI) and ma­chine learn­ing by the end of this year.</p>
    <p>The col­lab­o­ra­tion is in line with the bank’s plans to ac­cel­er­ate the use of AI and ma­chine learn­ing across its busi­ness.</p>
    <p>Through the jointly launched DBS x AWS Deep­Racer League, em­ploy­ees will com­plete a se­ries of hand­son on­line tu­to­ri­als be­fore putting their skills to the test by pro­gram­ming an au­ton­o­mous model race car. These ma­chine learn­ing mod­els will then be up­loaded to a vir­tual rac­ing en­vi­ron­ment where em­ploy­ees can ex­per­i­ment with and fine-tune their mod­els while en­gag­ing in friendly com­pe­ti­tion.</p>
    <p>The bank ex­pects at least 3,000 em­ploy­ees, in­clud­ing its se­nior lead­er­ship, to learn new AI and ma­chine learn­ing skills through the project.</p>
    <p>The ini­tia­tive comes on the back of DBS’ ef­forts to scale up its dig­i­tal learn­ing tools and plat­forms to en­able its em­ploy­ees to up­grade their skills and pick up new knowl­edge even when they are not phys­i­cally in the of­fice.</p>
    <p>Not­ing the un­con­ven­tional and in­no­va­tive ap­proach to up­skilling its em­ploy­ees, DBS chief data and trans­for­ma­tion of­fi­cer Paul Cob­ban said the bank in­tro­duced gam­i­fi­ca­tion ele­ments to bet­ter en­gage its em­ploy­ees and up­hold the ethos of keep­ing work and learn­ing fun.</p>
    <p>He added: “As a tech­nol­ogy com­pany that pro­vides bank­ing ser­vices, we are keenly aware of the need to stay ahead of the tech­nol­ogy curve to con­tinue ex­ceed­ing our cus­tomers’ ex­pec­ta­tions.</p>
    <p>“We have never be­lieved in lim­it­ing dig­i­tal ex­per­tise to a small team. In­stead, we pas­sion­ately be­lieve in democratis­ing tech­nol­ogy skill sets among all em­ploy­ees, so that they can run along­side the com­pany as we ad­vance on our dig­i­tal trans­for­ma­tion to­gether.”</p>
    <p>Em­ploy­ees who show a flair for AI and ma­chine learn­ing are en­cour­aged to go be­yond the DBS x AWS Deep­Racer League and take part in global com­pe­ti­tions.</p>
    <p>Since the start of its dig­i­tal trans­for­ma­tion seven years ago, DBS has in­vested heav­ily in up­skilling its em­ploy­ees’ dig­i­tal ca­pa­bil­i­ties.</p>
    <p>Last year, the bank dig­i­talised and sim­pli­fied end-to-end credit pro­cess­ing, set­ting the foun­da­tion for ad­vanced credit risk man­age­ment us­ing data an­a­lyt­ics and ma­chine learn­ing.</p>
    <p>It has also de­ployed an AI-pow­ered en­gine to pro­vide ac­cu­rate self­ser­vice dig­i­tal op­tions to its re­tail cus­tomers based on their dig­i­tal foot­print.</p>
    <p>Other com­pa­nies that have em­braced dig­i­tal trans­for­ma­tions and up­skilling move­ments in­clude the Pan Pa­cific Ho­tels Group, which in­creased the ap­pli­ca­tion of tech­nol­ogy and reskilling of its em­ploy­ees as it relooked its or­gan­i­sa­tional struc­ture dur­ing the Covid-19 lull.</p>
    <p>Pack­ag­ing com­pany Green­pac switched to a cloud-based sup­ply chain man­age­ment sys­tem, which al­lowed its staff to work from home when the Dis­ease Out­break Re­sponse Sys­tem Con­di­tion level was raised to or­ange ear­lier this year.</p>
