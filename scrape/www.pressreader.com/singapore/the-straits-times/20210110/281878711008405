    <p>The Com­mu­nity Chest’s (ComCh­est) vir­tual con­cert raised over $2.7 mil­lion for more than 80 social ser­vice agen­cies yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>This is more than dou­ble the $1.1 mil­lion raised in its char­ity con­cert last year.</p>
    <p>The money raised at the One Heart, One People, ComCh­est Night 2021 will help vul­ner­a­ble groups such as chil­dren with spe­cial needs, youth at risk, adults with dis­abil­i­ties, people with men­tal health con­di­tions, as well as un­der­priv­i­leged se­niors and fam­i­lies.</p>
    <p>Se­nior Min­is­ter Thar­man Shan­mu­garat­nam, who was the guest of hon­our of the fund-rais­ing ef­fort, said: “Our sol­i­dar­ity is now stronger than ever be­fore, and it shows in how people have re­sponded to the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>“A lot more people have been get­ting in­volved, a lot more do­na­tions, a lot more em­pa­thy and cre­ativ­ity in the dif­fer­ent ways we have reached out to help oth­ers.”</p>

    <p>“We felt that by do­nat­ing through Com­mu­nity Chest, our do­na­tion will serve the social ser­vice agen­cies that re­quire more sup­port than oth­ers,” said its re­gional pres­i­dent Brian Tan.</p>
    <p>Other com­pa­nies that do­nated in­clude Peren­nial Real Es­tate Hold­ings and The Capi­tol Kempin­ski Ho­tel Singapore.</p>
    <p>In Septem­ber last year, ComCh­est also launched Hearts as One – a dig­i­tal fund-rais­ing ini­tia­tive. It saw 19 lo­cal celebri­ties, chefs and in­flu­encers raise around $90,000 through live-stream­ing shows.</p>
    <p>Ms Mau­reen Ow, bet­ter known as food blog­ger Miss Tam Chiak, live-streamed food re­views while urg­ing view­ers to do­nate to the Com­mu­nity Chest.</p>
    <p>“Given th­ese un­prece­dented times, I can only imag­ine that the needs of our vul­ner­a­ble com­mu­ni­ties are height­ened, so I’m grate­ful for this op­por­tu­nity to step in and en­cour­age the com­mu­nity to do good,” she said.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day’s vir­tual con­cert fea­tured lo­cal singers Se­bas­tian Tan and Rahimah Rahim, as well as a song and dance per­for­mance by vol­un­teers from Nanyang Tech­no­log­i­cal Univer­sity’s cul­tural ac­tiv­i­ties club.</p>
    <p>Se­niors from Lions Be­frien­ders Ang Mo Kio se­nior ac­tiv­ity cen­tre also put up a per­cus­sion show.</p>
    <p>One of the per­form­ers, 83-yearold Madam Wee Chye Luan, said: “I hope to in­spire other se­niors to re­main healthy and ac­tive.”</p>
