    <p>An­other twist has emerged in the saga in­volv­ing the cousins linked to a com­pany that made a bid to buy English Premier League foot­ball club New­cas­tle United.

    <p>An­other twist has emerged in the saga in­volv­ing the two cousins linked to a com­pany that made an au­da­cious bid to buy English Premier League foot­ball club New­cas­tle United in Au­gust.</p>
    <p>Mr Ter­ence Loh is now link­ing Mr Nel­son Loh to cash miss­ing from a firm where Mr Nel­son Loh’s wife was a di­rec­tor.</p>
    <p>Mr Ter­ence Loh, 43, made a police re­port on Mon­day, al­leg­ing that be­tween April 27 and May 5 this year, a to­tal of $5.25 mil­lion was trans­ferred from three bank ac­counts be­long­ing to wine trad­ing and dis­tri­bu­tion com­pany Giron to per­sonal ac­counts which Mr Nel­son Loh, 41, had with OCBC Bank and United Over­seas Bank (UOB).</p>
    <p>Police con­firmed in­ves­ti­ga­tions are on­go­ing.</p>
    <p>At the time of the al­leged transactio­ns, the three di­rec­tors of the firm were Mr Ter­ence Loh’s sis­ter Mar­jory, Mr Nel­son Loh’s wife Lee</p>
    <p>Chai Hoon, and one Ms Lynn Yeow.</p>
    <p>Ms Yeow, 40, who left Giron in May, told The Straits Times that dur­ing her time with the com­pany, she was han­dling ad­ver­tis­ing and mar­ket­ing mat­ters and was not aware of the al­legedly unau­tho­rised transactio­ns.</p>
    <p>Mr Ter­ence Loh was ap­pointed a di­rec­tor of the com­pany in May.</p>
    <p>When con­tacted, he told ST: “I con­firm that I filed a police re­port on Dec 28 nam­ing Nel­son Loh as a sus­pect in sev­eral bank trans­fers of up to $5.25 mil­lion to him­self</p>
    <p>Mr Ter­ence Loh (left) al­leges that be­tween April 27 and May 5, a to­tal of $5.25 mil­lion was trans­ferred from three bank ac­counts be­long­ing to wine trad­ing and dis­tri­bu­tion firm Giron to the per­sonal bank ac­counts of his cousin Nel­son Loh. from Giron Pte Ltd.”</p>
    <p>Records from the Ac­count­ing and Cor­po­rate Reg­u­la­tory Author­ity show that Giron, which re­ported $19 mil­lion in rev­enue for the fi­nan­cial year end­ing Dec 31, 2019, has been placed in re­ceiver­ship.</p>
    <p>There were also four charges reg­is­tered by HSBC and UOB on the firm last year.</p>
    <p>A charge is a form of se­cu­rity in­ter­est usu­ally taken by a lender or cred­i­tor – “chargee” – to se­cure re­pay­ment of a loan.</p>
    <p>Said Mr Ter­ence Loh: “Not­with­stand­ing the trans­fers, Giron has re­ceived ex­pres­sions of in­ter­est from po­ten­tial buy­ers.</p>
    <p>“One party has ex­pressed strong in­ter­est in its busi­ness op­er­a­tions, re­la­tion­ships with vine­yards and cus­tomer base and is cur­rently con­duct­ing le­gal and fi­nan­cial due dili­gence on the com­pany.”</p>
    <p>Mr Ter­ence Loh added that he is hope­ful of con­clud­ing a trans­ac­tion in the com­ing weeks.</p>
    <p>The Loh cousins made news in Au­gust with a £280 mil­lion ($500 mil­lion) bid for New­cas­tle United.</p>
    <p>The bid was made un­der the Bellagraph Nova Group (BNG), which they founded with Chi­nese en­tre­pre­neur Evan­ge­line Shen. Mr Ter­ence Loh has since left the Sin­ga­pore-reg­is­tered BNG.</p>
    <p>Firms linked to the Loh cousins then came un­der in­tense scru­tiny.</p>
    <p>In Au­gust, police launched an in­ves­ti­ga­tion into Novena Global Health­care Group – co-founded by the Loh cousins and in­cor­po­rated in the Cay­man Is­lands – for al­legedly us­ing unau­tho­rised sig­na­tures of an ac­count­ing firm on its fi­nan­cial state­ments.</p>
    <p>Mr Nel­son Loh is be­lieved to be in China.</p>
