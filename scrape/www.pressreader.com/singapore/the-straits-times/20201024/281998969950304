    <p>Once reign­ing supreme across Asia, Euro­pean pow­ers be­came in­creas­ingly mar­ginal in the re­gion’s post-colo­nial his­tory. Ties be­tween larger South-east Asian coun­tries, such as the Philip­pines and Viet­nam, and their for­mer Euro­pean colonis­ers, Spain and France, are now over­shad­owed by new po­lit­i­cal play­ers.</p>
    <p>By and large, re­gional states look to the United States and China as their key strate­gic pri­or­i­ties, with Ja­pan, Aus­tralia, In­dia and South Korea perched on the lower rungs of the peck­ing or­der.</p>
    <p>Even though the Euro­pean Union’s eco­nomic clout is not to be dis­missed – it is Asean’s largest for­eign in­vestor and se­cond-big­gest trad­ing part­ner af­ter China – there has been a mis­placed sense that Europe has nei­ther the in­ter­est nor the in­flu­ence in global af­fairs.</p>
    <p>So when Ger­many, a coun­try that lacks even blue-wa­ter naval ca­pa­bil­ity, an­nounced its “Indo-Pa­cific” strat­egy last month, eye­brows were raised in puz­zle­ment across the re­gion; surely, with so many prob­lems in Europe, Covid-19 com­pound­ing them, why this foray into new en­tan­gle­ments?</p>
    <p>Less so per­haps vis-a-vis France, which is a ma­jor naval power and has a ge­o­graphic foot­print in the re­gion, but sim­i­lar ques­tions were asked about Pres­i­dent Em­manuel Macron’s de­ci­sion in 2018 to add the Indo-Pa­cific con­cept to its for­eign pol­icy lex­i­con, join­ing other ar­tic­u­la­tions by the Ja­panese, Aus­tralians and Amer­i­cans. Now, France has gone a step fur­ther by ap­point­ing this month its first am­bas­sador for the Indo-Pa­cific.</p>
    <p>The re­cent up­surge of Euro­pean in­ter­est in the Indo-Pa­cific is not, as some crit­ics say, sim­ply a mat­ter of grand­stand­ing or a crav­ing for the old glory days of em­pire.</p>
    <p>If there is a com­mon thread run­ning through the com­ments from France, Ger­many and Bri­tain on the mat­ter, it is China, specif­i­cally Beijing’s mus­cu­lar as­ser­tion of its claims over much of the South China Sea in de­fi­ance of in­ter­na­tional law.</p>
    <p>And while the Euro­peans lack the sheer mil­i­tary might of the Amer­i­cans, they are not to be dis­missed out of hand ei­ther in the push­back against Beijing. They bring to the ta­ble a dif­fer­ent set of strate­gic as­sets.</p>
    <p>DIPLO­MACY AND RULE OF LAW</p>
    <p>First, Europe’s foray into Asia’s se­cu­rity af­fairs makes it harder for China to push its ar­gu­ment that re­gional mar­itime dis­putes are solely a bi­lat­eral mat­ter be­tween it­self and ri­val claimant states, and “ex­ter­nal” par­ties, par­tic­u­larly from out­side the re­gion, should butt out. Given China’s over­whelm­ing strength, the Philip­pines, Viet­nam and Malaysia would stand no chance in as­sert­ing their claims to dis­puted South China Sea mar­itime fea­tures if they were to take on China in­di­vid­u­ally.</p>
    <p>What the Euro­pean trio of France, Ger­many and Bri­tain have done is to check China by col­lec­tively re­it­er­at­ing the pri­macy of the rule of law. In an un­prece­dented joint note ver­bale to the United Na­tions in</p>
    <p>Sep­tem­ber, they made clear the im­por­tance of a free and open or­der in the Indo-Pa­cific.</p>
    <p>With­out di­rectly blam­ing China, they em­pha­sised the im­por­tance of pre­serv­ing the “in­tegrity” of the Con­ven­tion on the Law of the Sea (Un­c­los). Cru­cially, the note ver­bale ex­plic­itly in­voked the Philip­pine-ini­ti­ated 2016 ar­bi­tral tri­bunal award at The Hague, which un­equiv­o­cally re­jected China’s ex­pan­sive “his­toric rights” claims.</p>
    <p>The three Euro­pean pow­ers are ef­fec­tively ac­cus­ing China of vi­o­lat­ing in­ter­na­tional law, with the lat­ter con­sis­tently re­fus­ing to recog­nise and com­ply with the ar­bi­tral rul­ing un­der the aegis of Un­c­los.</p>
    <p>Just months ear­lier, the Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion had re­leased its own ma­jor pol­icy state­ment on the South China Sea dis­putes, which sim­i­larly in­voked The Hague rul­ing against China’s claims.</p>
    <p>This seem­ingly co­or­di­nated le­gal war­fare (law­fare) has op­er­a­tional ram­i­fi­ca­tions, es­pe­cially as both Bri­tain and France are per­ma­nent mem­bers of the UN Se­cu­rity Coun­cil. To be­gin with, it pro­vides sup­port for the US’ free­dom of nav­i­ga­tion op­er­a­tions (Fonops) as a means of chal­leng­ing China’s ex­ces­sive mar­itime claims.</p>
    <p>This comes as other pow­ers hold their own ver­sions of Fonops, al­beit in more sub­tle fash­ion.</p>
    <p>Last year, China was en­raged when France’s naval frigate Ven­demi­aire con­ducted its own ac­cess oper­a­tion in the Tai­wan</p>
    <p>Strait amid ris­ing ten­sions be­tween Taipei and Beijing. In re­sponse, China with­drew its in­vi­ta­tion to the French naval del­e­ga­tion to take part in the 70th an­niver­sary of the Peo­ple’s Lib­er­a­tion Army Navy cel­e­bra­tions.</p>
    <p>Un­der Pres­i­dent Macron, France has also stepped up its strate­gic en­gage­ment with China’s ri­vals across the re­gion af­ter seal­ing multi-bil­lion-dol­lar de­fence deals with Aus­tralia and In­dia. The French leader has openly called for a “new Paris-Delhi-Can­berra axis”, which will “be re­spected by China as an equal part­ner” in re­gional strate­gic af­fairs.</p>
    <p>WHAT MORE CAN BE DONE</p>
    <p>The Euro­pean pow­ers’ Indo-Pa­cific in­ter­ven­tions, how­ever, can be even more con­se­quen­tial if they in­clude em­pow­er­ing smaller re­gional states which seek to check China’s worst in­stincts. This can come in two im­por­tant and rel­a­tively in­ex­pen­sive forms.</p>
    <p>First, Europe can help en­hance the ba­sic mar­itime do­main aware­ness and coast guard ca­pa­bil­i­ties of South-east Asian claimants such as the Philip­pines, Viet­nam, Malaysia and In­done­sia, which are strug­gling against China’s ar­mada of para­mil­i­tary forces roam­ing across the South China Sea. This would al­low re­gional states to de­ter Chi­nese en­croach­ments with­out risk­ing armed con­flict and un­wanted es­ca­la­tion.</p>
    <p>Re­cent strate­gic deals be­tween the EU and Viet­nam, namely the Frame­work Par­tic­i­pa­tion Agree­ment that fa­cil­i­tates close de­fence co­op­er­a­tion, should serve as a spring­board for closer and more ex­ten­sive mar­itime se­cu­rity co­op­er­a­tion. Ma­jor Euro­pean pow­ers should ex­plore sim­i­lar agree­ments with other key re­gional states, in­clud­ing the fel­low democ­ra­cies of the</p>
    <p>Philip­pines and In­done­sia.</p>
    <p>Se­cond, Europe can also pro­vide tech­ni­cal as­sis­tance to key South-east Asian coun­tries, which are grap­pling with Chi­nese preda­tory in­vest­ments. Ger­many is an eco­nomic pow­er­house with grow­ing trade and in­vest­ment across Asia.</p>
    <p>One ma­jor area of con­cern is Chi­nese state-backed com­pa­nies seek­ing in­vest­ments in crit­i­cal in­fra­struc­ture and sen­si­tive lo­ca­tions in places such as the Philip­pines.</p>
    <p>Europe can help counter th­ese preda­tory prac­tices by mo­bil­is­ing tar­geted in­vest­ments and pro­vid­ing tech­ni­cal ex­per­tise.</p>
    <p>It mat­ters when ma­jor coun­tries such as Ger­many, in tan­dem with Bri­tain and France, are now work­ing to give Europe a stronger voice in de­vel­op­ments in the Indo-Pa­cific.</p>
    <p>While the US is well equipped mil­i­tar­ily to grab head­lines with the de­ploy­ment of its air­craft car­ri­ers, Europe’s forte has long been its pa­tient diplo­macy and less showy yet con­se­quen­tial as­sis­tance. As the 2020 ISEAS – Yu­sof Ishak In­sti­tute sur­vey on the state of South-east Asia showed, that has not gone un­no­ticed, with the EU be­ing Asean’s se­cond most trusted part­ner, af­ter Ja­pan.</p>
    <p>Euro­pean pow­ers should do more with this reser­voir of good­will as they seek to put their stamp on the roil­ing po­lit­i­cal wa­ters of the Indo-Pa­cific. In this in­ter­con­nected world, the out­comes for bet­ter or worse will af­fect them too.</p>
