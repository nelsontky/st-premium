    <p>Three French po­lice of­fi­cers were shot dead by a man when they ar­rived at a home in Saint-Just, a re­mote com­mune in cen­tral France, to re­spond to a do­mes­tic vi­o­lence call, po­lice said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>A woman, who was the re­ported vic­tim of the do­mes­tic vi­o­lence, had sought refuge on the roof of the house and was sub­se­quently res­cued by po­lice, France’s</p>
    <p>BFMTV broad­caster re­ported.</p>
    <p>The house caught fire, po­lice said, and the sus­pected gun­man was later found dead in his car.</p>
    <p>It was not im­me­di­ately clear how he had died or where the car was lo­cated.</p>
    <p>Po­lice had pre­vi­ously said the man was armed and they were try­ing to track him down.</p>
    <p>The in­ci­dent took place in a small ham­let in Saint-Just, about 500km south-east of Paris.</p>
    <p>French Pres­i­dent Em­manuel Macron of­fered con­do­lences to the fam­i­lies of the dead of­fi­cers. “To pro­tect us, our forces act, putting their lives at risk. They are our heroes,” Mr Macron wrote on Twit­ter.</p>
    <p>A fourth of­fi­cer was wounded in the at­tack and his in­juries were not life-threat­en­ing, the in­te­rior min­istry said.</p>
    <p>Of­fi­cials did not com­ment on the mo­tive.</p>
    <p>France’s in­te­rior min­is­ter de­scribed the at­tacker as a “ma­niac”.</p>
    <p>The sus­pected gun­man was 48 and known to law en­force­ment for non-pay­ment of child main­te­nance, ac­cord­ing to an of­fi­cial in the prose­cu­tor’s of­fice in the nearby city of Cler­mont-Fer­rand.</p>
    <p>Of­fi­cers from the lo­cal po­lice ser­vice ar­rived at the house in the ham­let early in the morn­ing, af­ter re­ceiv­ing re­ports about a woman who had been beaten by her part­ner, the in­te­rior min­istry said in a state­ment.</p>
    <p>Of­fi­cer Arno Mavel, 21, died from his in­juries, the min­istry said.</p>
    <p>In a sec­ond unit of re­in­force­ments, Lieu­tenant Cyrille Morel, 45, and ad­ju­tant Remi Dupuis, 37, were both killed, it said.</p>
    <p>Af­ter the shoot­ings, po­lice com­man­ders sent in a rapid-re­sponse unit, de­ployed re­in­force­ments to seal off the area and launched a man­hunt for the sus­pected at­tacker.</p>
    <p>“The ma­niac has been found dead,” In­te­rior Min­is­ter Ger­ald Dar­manin wrote on Twit­ter yes­ter­day morn­ing, adding that he was head­ing to the scene of the at­tack.</p>
    <p>Aside from ter­ror at­tacks, shoot­ings of po­lice of­fi­cers in France are rel­a­tively rare.</p>
    <p>Last May, a man fired at po­lice from his house in the Gironde re­gion of south-west France, wound­ing one of­fi­cer. As he was about to fire again, he was shot dead by po­lice.</p>
