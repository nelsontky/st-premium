    <p>The watch world got it­self into a bit of a tizzy early this week.</p>
    <p>The rea­son? The Rolex Sub­mariner just got an up­date.</p>
    <p>What is the big deal, you might say.</p>
    <p>Well, the Sub­mariner just hap­pens to be one of the most iconic watches in the world, and one of the most sought af­ter. On In­sta­gram, it is the most pop­u­lar #di­ve­watch.</p>
    <p>A must-have in any self-re­spect­ing watch lover’s col­lec­tion, it was first in­tro­duced in 1953 as a solid tool watch (it was wa­ter-re­sis­tant to 100m even then, with a uni-directiona­l ro­tat­ing bezel).</p>
    <p>But it is now a sta­tus sym­bol – thanks to its ver­sa­til­ity, clas­sic good looks, solid con­struc­tion and, of course, savvy ad­ver­tis­ing.</p>
    <p>Do not even dream of try­ing to score one at its rec­om­mended re­tail price in an au­tho­rised shop or bou­tique. The wait­ing list is a few years long.</p>
    <p>If you want one des­per­ately, you have to go to a dealer and be willing to fork out a pre­mium – usu­ally dou­ble the price.</p>
    <p>The up­dated Sub­mariner and Sub­mariner Date models, like all the brand’s new re­leases, fol­low a Rolex master move: no mess­ing with the watch’s aes­thet­ics and</p>
    <p>DNA, just mi­nor and sub­tle tweaks which of­fer gen­uine im­prove­ment.</p>
    <p>The first change is the case size: 41mm in­stead of 40mm. The size in­crease, how­ever, is off­set by slim­mer lugs.</p>
    <p>Help­ing to give it a more shapely and stream­lined ap­pear­ance is the slightly wider three-link Oys­ter bracelet which was first de­vel­oped in the 1930s. It also boasts the Rolex Glide­lock ex­ten­sion sys­tem, which al­lows the bracelet to be ad­justed eas­ily with­out the need for tools.</p>
    <p>The sec­ond, and more sig­nif­i­cant, change is the move­ment. Over the last few years, Rolex has been up­dat­ing its watches with new cal­i­bres.</p>
    <p>The new heart – the 3230 for the Sub­mariner and the 3235 for the Sub­mariner Date – of­fers 70 hours of power re­serve in­stead of 48.</p>
    <p>Then there is a slight aes­thetic tweak at six o’clock at the bot­tom of the dial. A Rolex crown logo now sits be­tween the words Swiss Made. Other key developmen­ts?</p>
    <p>The all-green Hulk model will be no more, taken over by one with a green bezel and a black dial.</p>
    <p>There are two other new models: a Sub­mariner Date in white gold with a black dial and a bright blue bezel as well as a new Role­sor, fash­ioned from Oys­ter­steel and yel­low gold, with a royal blue dial and blue bezel.</p>
    <p>Judg­ing by the on­line frenzy, the new Sub­mariner is al­ready a big hit.</p>
    <p>Prices range from $10,880 for the Sub­mariner in Oys­ter­steel to $53,310 for the Sub­mariner Date in white gold.</p>
