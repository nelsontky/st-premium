    <p>City De­vel­op­ments Lim­ited (CDL) ex­pects to fall into the red in 2020 with a full-year loss, re­vers­ing from a $564.6 mil­lion net profit in 2019, dragged down by the pro­longed im­pact of the coro­n­avirus out­break.</p>
    <p>It fore­sees fur­ther im­pair­ment losses, and Bri­tish sub­sidiary Mil­len­nium & Copthorne Ho­tels (M&C) and China-based joint ven­ture Sin­cere Prop­erty Group are set to spill some red ink.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, Deloitte & Touche Fi­nan­cial Ad­vi­sory Ser­vices has com­pleted its re­view into CDL’s in­vest­ment in Sin­cere and “as­cer­tained that there are good as­sets that the group can ex­tract fur­ther value (from)”, CDL said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The group noted in a profit guidance that there have been “signs of im­prove­ment and some early re­sults of changes to op­er­a­tions, cost struc­ture and mar­ket­ing”.</p>
    <p>Rev­enue from the group’s prop­erty de­vel­op­ment seg­ment this year will be lower than a year ago. Over­all profit mar­gins in the first nine months had de­clined year on year, as more rev­enue was recog­nised from mass-mar­ket projects on a progress com­ple­tion ba­sis.</p>
    <p>The seg­ment’s re­ported rev­enue in Jan­uary to Septem­ber also de­creased by 15 per cent from a year ago, even with a se­quen­tial re­cov­ery in the third quar­ter. The seg­ment sold 710 units with a value of $914.1 mil­lion dur­ing the July-Septem­ber pe­riod, up from the pre­vi­ous quar­ter’s sales of 174 units val­ued at $240.9 mil­lion, CDL said in an op­er­a­tional up­date yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The in­vest­ment prop­er­ties seg­ment sim­i­larly reg­is­tered a 14 per cent drop in rev­enue for the first nine months of this year. This came as CDL ex­tended over $30 mil­lion of prop­erty tax and rental re­bates to re­tail ten­ants in Sin­ga­pore and over­seas.</p>
    <p>CDL’s Sin­ga­pore of­fice port­fo­lio had a com­mit­ted occupancy of 92 per cent as at Sept 30. Repub­lic Plaza, its flag­ship of­fice prop­erty in Raf­fles Place, is over 96 per cent leased.</p>
    <p>Its re­tail and food and bev­er­age (F&B) ten­ants, mean­while, have al­most all re­opened for busi­ness, ex­cept for the en­ter­tain­ment trade. CDL said F&B re­mained re­silient dur­ing the lat­est quar­ter, with some re­tail­ers look­ing at ex­pan­sion op­por­tu­ni­ties.</p>
    <p>The ho­tel op­er­a­tions arm, led by wholly owned M&C, an­tic­i­pates full-year losses for this year, given the col­lapse in global travel and tourism amid the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>This is de­spite M&C en­ti­ties’ re­cov­ery from a loss to gross op­er­at­ing profit in Asia since May and in New Zealand since June, and M&C’s global gross op­er­at­ing profit hav­ing been pos­i­tive since July.</p>
    <p>For the Jan­uary-Septem­ber pe­riod, rev­enue per avail­able room (RevPAR) tum­bled 63 per cent on the year while ho­tel rev­enue sank 60 per cent.</p>
    <p>Global occupancy at its ho­tels halved to 38.3 per cent, from 74 per cent a year ago.</p>
    <p>As for Sin­cere, in which CDL bought a 51.01 per cent in­ter­est this April, the joint ven­ture is ex­pected to be in a loss po­si­tion again, in the fourth quar­ter.</p>
    <p>For the first nine months of this year, the group had eq­uity ac­counted for its share of losses in Sin­cere to­talling $76 mil­lion, due to lower sales and han­dover of prop­er­ties as a re­sult of the Covid-19 out­break, fi­nanc­ing costs and the re­lease of fair-value up­lift for the de­vel­op­ment prop­er­ties port­fo­lio.</p>
