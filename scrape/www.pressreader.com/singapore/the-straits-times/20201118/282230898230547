    <p>Say you have $10,000 in sav­ings and you are look­ing to park that in an en­dow­ment plan.</p>
    <p>Would you buy a new 12-year plan that gives you 3 per cent an­nual in­vest­ment re­turns or a sec­ond-hand in­sur­ance pol­icy for which you need to pay pre­mi­ums for just four years to get at least a 4 per cent rate of re­turn?</p>
    <p>Many in­vestors would pick the one with the higher in­vest­ment value and a shorter term.</p>
    <p>Th­ese poli­cies also have pay­outs tied to the orig­i­nal pol­i­cy­holder’s life. That means the buyer of such a sec­ond-hand pol­icy can get a pay­out from the in­surer when the in­sured per­son named in the pol­icy dies.</p>
    <p>Cur­rent mar­ket volatil­ity and low in­ter­est rates have made sec­ond-hand or traded en­dow­ment poli­cies (TEPs) and traded life poli­cies (TLPs) more at­trac­tive to in­vestors.</p>
    <p>In the past five years, more com­pa­nies and in­di­vid­u­als have been trad­ing such poli­cies. This is le­gal though such activities are not gov­erned by the Mone­tary Au­thor­ity of Sin­ga­pore (MAS).</p>
    <p>There is no limit to the num­ber of times an en­dow­ment or life pol­icy can change own­er­ship.</p>
    <p>Such trans­fers have to take place on the in­sur­ers’ premises.</p>
    <p>Re­sellers tar­get in­di­vid­u­als who are look­ing to sur­ren­der their poli­cies and of­fer them a higher amount than their sur­ren­der value.</p>
    <p>Last year, pol­i­cy­hold­ers claimed al­most $2.2 bil­lion through the sur­ren­der of life prod­ucts, an in­crease of al­most 150 per cent from the $893 mil­lion claimed in 2013, which was when the claims started to rise.</p>
    <p>Ev­i­dently there is a large pool of poli­cies that re­sellers can tap.</p>
    <p>In­dus­try play­ers expect more cash-strapped in­di­vid­u­als af­fected by the coro­n­avirus pan­demic to want to cash out.</p>
    <p>Right now, it looks like a win-win sit­u­a­tion for all par­ties in­volved. The seller gets a higher</p>
    <p>“sur­ren­der” value by sell­ing the pol­icy, while the buyer could eas­ily get a re­turn of above 6 per cent per an­num if he con­tin­ues to pay the pre­mi­ums un­til the pol­icy’s ma­tu­rity date.</p>
    <p>Gen­er­ally, the in­vest­ment re­turns for a new 10-year en­dow­ment pol­icy would be about 3 per cent a year. The buyer can keep or re­sell the pol­icy for re­turns of up to twice that and profit from the dif­fer­ence.</p>
    <p>A re­sale pol­icy listed on the Purvis Cap­i­tal web­site showed an in­vestor needs to pay an ini­tial amount of $139,297 and an an­nual pre­mium of $16,340 for four years (un­til 2023) to get a pro­jected ma­tu­rity pay­out of $298,178 in 2030.</p>
    <p>Purvis Cap­i­tal would have bought the pol­icy for less than $139,297 from the pre­vi­ous owner.</p>
    <p>For a to­tal in­vest­ment of $204,657, the in­vestor could get 45 per cent more at the end of the orig­i­nal 10-year term.</p>
    <p>So what are the risks?</p>
    <p>Lawyer Steven Lam of Tem­plars Law who spe­cialises in in­sur­ance and re-in­sur­ance mat­ters laid out two com­mon sce­nar­ios which can trig­ger a dis­pute in the re­sale mar­ket.</p>
    <p>Sce­nario 1:</p>
    <p>A pol­i­cy­holder sells his en­dow­ment plan to com­pany A, which re­sells it to an in­vestor. This in­vestor con­tin­ues to pay the pre­mium un­til ma­tu­rity.</p>
    <p>In the event of a non-pay­out by the in­surer, the in­vestor may sue the orig­i­nal pol­i­cy­holder in­stead of the in­surer be­cause the</p>
    <p>Con­tract (Rights of Third Par­ties) Act does not apply in the in­sur­ance in­dus­try.</p>
    <p>The in­vestor also can­not com­plain to MAS be­cause the relationsh­ip be­tween the seller and in­vestor is not reg­u­lated by MAS. As such, con­sumers who buy TLPs and TEPs can­not rely on laws ad­min­is­tered by MAS to take ac­tion against ei­ther the in­ter­me­di­ary who re-sold or pack­aged the poli­cies or the dis­trib­u­tor of the poli­cies should they en­counter any prob­lems, said MAS.</p>
    <p>Sce­nario 2:</p>
    <p>Com­pany A buys an en­dow­ment plan and pays the pol­i­cy­holder in tranches with the last pay­ment due at the end of the pol­icy term.</p>
    <p>When the pol­icy ma­tures, the in­surer pays com­pany A the ma­tu­rity sum as in­structed by the orig­i­nal pol­i­cy­holder when he trans­ferred the own­er­ship of the pol­icy to com­pany A.</p>
    <p>But com­pany A fails to pay the fi­nal sum to the orig­i­nal pol­i­cy­holder, who would not be able to in­struct the in­surer to claw back on the pay­out.</p>
    <p>Said Mr Lam: “They can sue each other in court be­cause MAS is not go­ing to in­ter­vene. They also can’t go to Fidrec (Financial In­dus­try Dis­putes Res­o­lu­tion Cen­tre). They can file a com­plaint with Case (Con­sumers As­so­ci­a­tion of Sin­ga­pore) but the Con­sumer Pro­tec­tion (Fair Trad­ing) Act doesn’t re­ally cover (this) per se be­cause ef­fec­tively, it is a con­trac­tual in­vest­ment dis­pute.”</p>
    <p>Be­sides the pos­si­ble dis­putes that may arise, there is also the ques­tion of whether it is eth­i­cal to al­low some­one to­tally un­re­lated to the life in­sured to hold on to the ben­e­fi­cial in­ter­ests of another per­son’s life, said cor­po­rate gov­er­nance ad­vo­cate Mak Yuen Teen, who is as­so­ciate pro­fes­sor of ac­count­ing at the NUS Busi­ness School.</p>
    <p>He also raised con­cerns over the pos­si­ble un­der-dec­la­ra­tion of cer­tain con­di­tions by the seller of a life pol­icy.</p>
    <p>“I think the risks need to be looked at more care­fully,” said Prof Mak.</p>
    <p>In most cases, a re­seller would just reveal the in­vest­ment value to an in­vestor who would not know the iden­tity of the orig­i­nal pol­i­cy­holder. The in­vestor has to trust that the re­seller had done due dili­gence checks on the orig­i­nal pol­i­cy­holder when he bought the pol­icy.</p>
    <p>While a re­sale mar­ket might pro­vide more op­tions for con­sumers, they should also be fully aware of the risks in­volved.</p>
    <p>And since the sec­tor is rel­a­tively new and un­reg­u­lated or li­censed by MAS, a code of con­duct could help. Such a code could be drawn up by MAS or the Life In­sur­ance As­so­ci­a­tion.</p>
    <p>Hav­ing a stan­dard­ised code of prac­tice to en­sure that re­sellers make cer­tain dis­clo­sures to both sellers and in­vestors could help to pre­vent or min­imise any mis-sell­ing by re­sellers.</p>
