    <p>Bull­doz­ers combed through de­bris from col­lapsed build­ings as rescuers tore down walls by hand to search for vic­tims in Turkey’s Aegean port city of Izmir that was rocked by a pow­er­ful earth­quake on Fri­day.</p>
    <p>A mother and three of her chil­dren were pulled to safety af­ter be­ing trapped for al­most 18 hours un­der a build­ing. Rescuers were con­tin­u­ing ef­forts to free the woman’s fourth child.</p>
    <p>At least 28 peo­ple were killed and more than 800 in­jured.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore’s For­eign Min­is­ter Vi­vian Balakr­ish­nan has writ­ten to the for­eign min­is­ters of the Repub­lic of Turkey and the Hel­lenic Repub­lic to of­fer con­do­lences over the earth­quake.</p>
    <p>The Min­istry of For­eign Af­fairs has also reached out to e-reg­is­tered Sin­ga­pore­ans in the af­fected ar­eas. Thus far, there are no re­ports of in­jured Sin­ga­pore­ans.</p>
    <p>Res­cue work­ers yes­ter­day raced to find sur­vivors in col­lapsed build­ings in Turkey’s Aegean port city of Izmir fol­low­ing a pow­er­ful earth­quake that killed at least 28 peo­ple.</p>
    <p>Af­ter­shocks con­tin­ued fol­low­ing Fri­day’s 6.9-mag­ni­tude tremor, with more than 5,000 peo­ple join­ing res­cue ef­forts yes­ter­day to fo­cus on eight razed build­ings.</p>
    <p>Turkey’s Dis­as­ter and Emer­gency Man­age­ment Pres­i­dency said at least 831 peo­ple were in­jured, while the death toll in­cluded two peo­ple on a Greek is­land near the Turk­ish coast­line.</p>
    <p>A mother and three of her chil­dren were pulled to safety yes­ter­day af­ter be­ing trapped for al­most 18 hours un­der a build­ing in Izmir.</p>
    <p>Rescuers were con­tin­u­ing ef­forts to free the woman’s fourth child, as the Aegean port city’s mayor said around 180 peo­ple re­mained trapped.</p>
    <p>“In the mean­time, we are de­lighted to be hear­ing mir­a­cles hap­pen­ing as a re­sult of dili­gent work by res­cue teams,” mayor Tunc Soyer told tele­vi­sion chan­nel Fox TV.</p>
    <p>As bull­doz­ers re­moved de­bris from col­lapsed build­ings and rescuers dis­man­tled walls by hand, En­vi­ron­ment Min­is­ter Mu­rat Ku­rum said some 100 peo­ple had been res­cued so far.</p>
    <p>The first 300 of 900 tents pro­vided for those made home­less were erected in the city.</p>
    <p>Mr Oguz Demirkapi, who was among the sur­vivors plucked from a seven-storey apart­ment block that crum­bled in Izmir, said there could be as many as two dozen peo­ple still un­der the rub­ble of his build­ing.</p>
    <p>“I formed a life tri­an­gle be­tween the wall and a TV stand,” he said by tele­phone.</p>
    <p>“It was hard to breathe ini­tially but then a rel­a­tive called and I was able to talk. Crews took me out about half an hour later,” said Mr Demirkapi, a 48-year-old ex­ec­u­tive at a mo­bile ap­pli­ca­tions com­pany.</p>
    <p>The epi­cen­tre of the quake, given a pre­lim­i­nary mag­ni­tude of 7.0 by the US Ge­o­log­i­cal Sur­vey, was 17km off the coastal town of Se­fer­i­hisar at more than 10km be­low the seabed, of­fi­cials said.</p>
    <p>Tremors were felt as far away as the com­mer­cial cap­i­tal, Is­tan­bul.</p>
    <p>The gov­er­nor of Izmir de­scribed a “par­tial tsunami” and the Greek au­thor­i­ties is­sued a tsunami warn­ing for the is­land of Samos af­ter the earth­quake, state-run ERT said.</p>
    <p>“Bridges have col­lapsed and we were un­able to en­ter the town,” Mr Hasim Kavuklu, a ho­tel worker in the town of Si­gacik, told Bloomberg by tele­phone. “The sea first ebbed and then came back.”</p>
    <p>Some ves­sels cap­sized in the ma­rina at Se­fer­i­hisar, Mr Kavuklu said, adding that there were con­cerns for fish­ing boats out at sea.</p>
    <p>One per­son us­ing a wheel­chair drowned in the area as the wa­ters rose, BBC Turk­ish re­ported.</p>
    <p>“There shouldn’t be such de­struc­tion in this kind of an earth­quake,” Bir­gun news­pa­per cited dis­as­ter re­cov­ery ex­pert Ku­bi­lay</p>
    <p>SUF­FO­CAT­ING</p>
    <p>It was hard to breathe ini­tially, but then a rel­a­tive called and I was able to talk. Crews took me out about half an hour later.</p>
    <p>MR OGUZ DEMIRKAPI, 48, an ex­ec­u­tive who was among the sur­vivors plucked from a seven-storey apart­ment block that crum­bled in Izmir.</p>
    <p>Kap­tan as say­ing. “Build­ings in Turkey should be re­sis­tant to tremors of mag­ni­tude 7, at the very least.”</p>
    <p>Peo­ple in Samos re­ceived a text mes­sage on their mo­bile phones to evac­u­ate coastal ar­eas.</p>
    <p>One high school stu­dent on the is­land was killed and an­other later died from in­juries af­ter a wall col­lapsed on them, ERT said.</p>
    <p>Greek Prime Min­is­ter Kyr­i­akos Mit­so­takis called Turk­ish Pres­i­dent Re­cep Tayyip Er­do­gan to of­fer his con­do­lences for the “tragic loss of life from the earth­quake that struck both our coun­tries”, the Greek premier said in a Twit­ter post. “What­ever our dif­fer­ences,</p>
    <p>th­ese are times when our peo­ple need to stand to­gether.”</p>
    <p>The two coun­tries have for weeks been in­volved in heated dis­putes over Turk­ish en­ergy ex­plo­ration in the eastern Mediter­ranean and the di­vided is­land of Cyprus.</p>
    <p>France is in “full sol­i­dar­ity with the Greek and Turk­ish pop­u­la­tions”, For­eign Min­is­ter Jean-Yves Le Drian said via Twit­ter.</p>
    <p>Turkey lies in one of the world’s most ac­tive seis­mic zones and is crossed by nu­mer­ous fault lines. In 1999, two earth­quakes with a mag­ni­tude of more than 7 struck north­west­ern Turkey, killing about 18,000 peo­ple.</p>
