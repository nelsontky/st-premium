    <p>Work-re­lated events that take place in the of­fice – such as sem­i­nars, cor­po­rate re­treats and an­nual gen­eral meet­ings – have been given the green light to go ahead as long as safe man­age­ment mea­sures are in place.</p>
    <p>How­ever, large-scale so­cial gath­er­ings, in­clud­ing team bond­ing and din­ner and dance events, re­main pro­hib­ited both in and out­side the work­place, said Ed­u­ca­tion Min­is­ter Lawrence Wong yes­ter­day, dur­ing a press con­fer­ence by the mul­ti­min­istry task force tack­ling the Covid-19 pan­demic.</p>
    <p>“The only things that will re­sume are work-re­lated events,” em­pha­sised Mr Wong, who co-chairs the task force with Health Min­is­ter Gan Kim Yong.</p>
    <p>In its up­dated set of re­quire­ments for safe man­age­ment mea­sures at the work­place, the Man­power Min­istry said that a max­i­mum of 50 peo­ple will be al­lowed to at­tend such work­place events to limit the risk of ex­po­sure to in­fec­tion.</p>
    <p>This num­ber may be lower, de­pend­ing on the venue’s ca­pac­ity, as par­tic­i­pants must stay at least 1m apart from one an­other.</p>
    <p>Food and drinks should not be served. If it is deemed nec­es­sary to serve meals, par­tic­i­pants should be seated and served in­di­vid­u­ally.</p>
    <p>Although more peo­ple will be al­lowed back into the of­fice, work­ing from home re­mains the de­fault, Mr Wong said.</p>
    <p>Em­ploy­ers must en­sure that staff who can work from home con­tinue to do so for at least half their work­ing hours, and that no more than half of such em­ploy­ees are at the work­place at any given time.</p>
    <p>They should also work to min­imis­ing crowd­ing and pos­si­ble con­gre­ga­tion at com­mon spa­ces by im­ple­ment­ing flex­i­ble work hours or fur­ther stag­ger­ing re­port­ing times, such that half of all em­ploy­ees start work at or af­ter 10am.</p>
    <p>“We would like em­ploy­ers to put in place ar­range­ments for their em­ploy­ees to be able to work partly at home and partly at the work­place, so it doesn’t have to be such a bi­nary ar­range­ment,” Mr Wong added.</p>
    <p>For in­stance, staff could be re­quired to be in the of­fice be­tween 1pm and 5pm, or re­turn to the of­fice only for meet­ings.</p>
    <p>Split team or shift ar­range­ments must still be ob­served, with clear sep­a­ra­tion be­tween dif­fer­ent groups of em­ploy­ees.</p>
    <p>These plans were drawn up af­ter tri­par­tite dis­cus­sions in­volv­ing em­ploy­ers, unions and work­ers, as well as the Government, Mr Wong said.</p>
    <p>The Health Min­istry added in a sep­a­rate state­ment that the changes aim to “bal­ance the con­cerns of em­ploy­ers re­gard­ing the im­pact of ex­tended pe­ri­ods of work­ing from home on pro­duc­tiv­ity and work­place re­la­tions, while cre­at­ing safe work­places for em­ploy­ees”.</p>
    <p>They will also help sup­port work­ers who face dif­fi­cul­ties in work­ing from home, it said.</p>
    <p>Mr Wong added that the pub­lic sec­tor will take the same ap­proach.</p>
    <p>“With these new guide­lines, agen­cies will look at their own needs, and to the ex­tent that some agen­cies may have a re­quire­ment for more of­fi­cers to come back, they will do so,” he said.</p>
    <p>“But they will fol­low strictly the new guide­lines that we have high­lighted.”</p>
    <p>The au­thor­i­ties stressed that safe man­age­ment mea­sures must be in place at all work­places, with em­ploy­ees spaced at least 1m apart at work­sta­tions or meet­ing rooms.</p>
    <p>Com­mon spa­ces must be cleaned reg­u­larly, and em­ploy­ers should en­sure that their staff keep to pre­vail­ing guide­lines on the per­mis­si­ble group size for so­cial gath­er­ings.</p>
    <p>This ap­plies to ar­eas such as staff can­teens, pantries and smok­ing cor­ners.</p>
    <p>Com­pa­nies that do not com­ply with safe man­age­ment mea­sures risk be­ing fined, hav­ing their on­site op­er­a­tions sus­pended or not get­ting pay­outs for government sup­port and grants. More se­vere vi­o­la­tions may re­sult in pros­e­cu­tion.</p>
    <p>WORK­ING AT HOME AND AT WORK­PLACE</p>
    <p>We would like em­ploy­ers to put in place ar­range­ments for their em­ploy­ees to be able to work partly at home and partly at the work­place, so it doesn’t have to be such a bi­nary ar­range­ment.</p>
