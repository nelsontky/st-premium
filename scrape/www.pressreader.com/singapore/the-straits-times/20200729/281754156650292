    <p>For the sev­enth straight day, Hong Kong has recorded over 100 new Covid-19 cases. The health au­thor­i­ties yes­ter­day said there were 106 new in­fec­tions, of which 98 were lo­cal and the rest im­ported. This brings the to­tal tally in the ter­ri­tory to 2,884, in­clud­ing 23 fa­tal­i­ties.</p>
    <p>Ten of the deaths oc­curred in the past week. So far, 15 deaths have been recorded this month, with some linked to the spread in el­derly care homes. The av­er­age age of those who died this month is 82.</p>
    <p>Hospi­tal Author­ity Chief Man­ager Sara Ho noted that Hong Kong’s fa­tal­ity rate so far is at 0.8 per cent, which is “not ex­cep­tion­ally high” when com­pared with that of those over­seas.</p>
    <p>She added that the epi­demi­ol­ogy of the pa­tients ad­mit­ted in the cur­rent third wave of in­fec­tions shows that a larger pro­por­tion of those who suc­cumbed re­cently are past 65 years old, higher than in the sec­ond wave.</p>
    <p>Asked if the Sept 6 Leg­isla­tive Coun­cil elec­tions will go ahead as planned, the au­thor­i­ties yes­ter­day said that they were mon­i­tor­ing the pan­demic closely. Lo­cal me­dia, quot­ing sources, have re­ported that the gov­ern­ment could soon an­nounce a de­lay in the elec­tions for a year.</p>
    <p>Ear­lier in the day, Food and Health Sec­re­tary Sophia Chan told a lo­cal ra­dio pro­gramme that she be­lieved the num­ber of lo­cal Covid-19 cases would drop over the next week or two, fol­low­ing the fur­ther tight­en­ing of rules.</p>
    <p>Speak­ing on an RTHK ra­dio pro­gramme, Pro­fes­sor Chan said lat­est fig­ures showed that the trans­mis­sion rate for the virus had dipped.</p>
    <p>She added that at the start of the new wave of new cases ear­lier this month, the data showed that the trans­mis­sion rate was one to four, that is, one in­di­vid­ual could in­fect up to four oth­ers.</p>
    <p>But this has now come down to one, Prof Chan noted.</p>
    <p>The gov­ern­ment on Mon­day fur­ther tight­ened so­cial dis­tanc­ing mea­sures in an at­tempt to con­tain lo­cal trans­mis­sions.</p>
    <p>From to­day, the cap on public gath­er­ings is two, down from four.</p>
    <p>Masks have to be worn at all times in out­door public places while din­ing in is banned at all eater­ies. The lat­ter mea­sure is ex­pected to hit some 7,000 food and bev­er­age op­er­a­tors.</p>
    <p>Sports cen­tres and swim­ming pools were added to the list of venues or­dered to shut for seven days till Aug 4.</p>
    <p>An ini­tial list in­clud­ing gyms, amuse­ment parks, cin­e­mas, beauty par­lours and night­clubs were or­dered to shut on July 15 for a week. The clo­sures were ex­tended for a week till July 28 and now till Aug 4.</p>
