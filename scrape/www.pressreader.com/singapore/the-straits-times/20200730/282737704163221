    <p>Marie Curie was one of the great­est sci­en­tific minds of the last cen­tury, but, com­pared with the no­table male sci­en­tists of her gen­er­a­tion, the story of her life is rarely told.</p>
    <p>A new film, Ra­dioac­tive, sets out to change that. The his­tor­i­cal drama, show­ing in cin­e­mas here, ex­plores the ex­tra­or­di­nary life and work of the dou­ble No­bel Prize win­ner, who died at 66 in 1934 and made pi­o­neer­ing dis­cov­er­ies on ra­dioac­tiv­ity, a term she coined.</p>
    <p>Also ex­am­ined are her ro­mance with hus­band and sci­en­tific part­ner Pierre Curie, with whom she shared her first No­bel Prize, and some of the darker as­pects of her legacy.</p>
    <p>Speak­ing at a screen­ing of the movie in Toronto last year, Rosamund Pike, the Bri­tish ac­tress who plays Curie, de­scribes the sci­en­tist as a “dar­ing, bril­liant, un­usual and im­pla­ca­ble wo­man”.</p>
    <p>Pike, 41, says she and di­rec­tor Mar­jane Sa­trapi be­came “kin­dred spir­its in pur­suit of find­ing the truth of Madame Curie” and praises the film-maker for do­ing “some­thing ex­tra­or­di­nary with an ex­tra­or­di­nary wo­man”.</p>
    <p>Sa­trapi, 50, sought to go be­yond cur­sory pop­u­lar de­pic­tions of the French-Pol­ish sci­en­tist who i n 1903 be­came the first wo­man to win a No­bel Prize for physics.</p>
    <p>In 1911, she won it again, this time for chem­istry – mak­ing her the first per­son to re­ceive it twice.</p>
    <p>Like many, Sa­trapi, who is Ira­nian-French, says she “grew up with the myth of Madame Curie, but it was only once I started mak­ing the film that I un­der­stood how truly huge and im­mense she was”.</p>
    <p>In ad­di­tion to her sci­en­tific bril­liance, what set Curie apart was how head­strong and de­ter­mined she was.</p>
    <p>“She was com­pletely un­com­pro­mis­ing and with­out mak­ing a case out of it – she was just like that,” says Sa­trapi, best known for the Os­car-nom­i­nated an­i­mated film Perse­po­lis (2007), about a girl com­ing of age dur­ing the Ira­nian Rev­o­lu­tion.</p>
    <p>For Pike, old pho­to­graphs of the sci­en­tist and a page from her di­ary were key to un­der­stand­ing her.</p>
    <p>“I felt like she was a very busy per­son, fo­cused on the task at hand at all times,” says the ac­tress, who was nom­i­nated for a Best Ac­tress Os­car for psy­cho­log­i­cal thriller Gone Girl (2014).</p>
    <p>“A lot of the clues come from the pho­to­graphs that ex­ist of her, where never once does she seem to be stand­ing still and ac­cept­ing of hav­ing her pho­to­graph taken – she always seems slightly an­noyed at the process.”</p>
    <p>Pike, who also ap­peared in the 2002 James Bond movie Die An­other Day, ob­serves: “She’s usu­ally in con­ver­sa­tion with some­one while the photo’s be­ing taken, or hur­ry­ing to the next des­ti­na­tion. It’s very hard to find a pic­ture of her where she’s not look­ing slightly im­pa­tient if she is stand­ing still.</p>
    <p>“There’s a won­der­ful pic­ture at a con­fer­ence where she’s the only fe­male sci­en­tist stand­ing with all the em­i­nent male sci­en­tists of her gen­er­a­tion and they’re all pos­ing very nicely for the cam­era, but she’s busily in­volved in con­ver­sa­tion with her neigh­bour. So it was clues like that.”</p>
    <p>An­other rev­e­la­tion was a doc­u­ment that be­came pub­lic only a year be­fore the movie was made and hith­erto kept pri­vate by the Curie fam­ily.</p>
    <p>“It was a grief journal that she kept in the days and weeks af­ter Pierre’s death,” says Pike. “I met Mar­jane in Paris and she pre­sented me with a trans­la­tion of a page of this journal, and it was the most mov­ing out­pour­ing of love – true, sin­cere, grief-wracked love – that I’ve ever read, and it just moved me to tears.”</p>
    <p>She adds: “And I thought, ‘My god, no­body knows this side of this wo­man.’ Ev­ery­thing you see is this for­mi­da­ble, bril­liant, quite aus­tere and quite odd char­ac­ter, and in­side is this per­son with rivers of feel­ing and love.</p>
    <p>“I thought, ‘How in­ter­est­ing’. Now I’ve got these two sides of this per­son and I’ve just got to fill in the rest.”</p>
    <p>For Sa­trapi, the main goal was to tell the story of a bril­liant wo­man that might per­haps in­spire oth­ers.</p>
    <p>“Stud­ies have shown that up till the age of seven, girls can con­sider them­selves as be­ing ge­niuses, but af­ter that, (they think) ‘ge­nius’ is some­thing that goes only with boys,” says the film-maker, who is also a graphic artist and chil­dren’s au­thor.</p>
    <p>“So first, I wanted to make sci­ence more at­trac­tive, be­cause there’s noth­ing more at­trac­tive than in­tel­li­gence.”</p>
    <p>Sa­trapi adds: “And half the pop­u­la­tion are women, so half the sto­ries should be about women, but this is not the case. In most films, they are always ‘the wife of’, ‘the mother of’, ‘the sis­ter of’ – they’re always re­lated to some­one.</p>
    <p>“But Marie Curie is her­self – and ev­ery­thing else is re­lated to her.”</p>
