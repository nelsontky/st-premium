    <p>The po­lice will not be tak­ing any fur­ther ac­tion in re­la­tion to Ed­u­ca­tion Min­is­ter Ong Ye Kung’s breach of elec­tion cam­paign rules dur­ing the re­cent gen­eral elec­tion (GE).</p>
    <p>In a joint state­ment yes­ter­day, the Elec­tions Depart­ment and the Sin­ga­pore Po­lice Force said the de­ci­sion was made after the As­sis­tant Re­turn­ing Of­fi­cer (ARO) looked into the mat­ter.</p>
    <p>“The As­sis­tant Re­turn­ing Of­fi­cer (ARO) had is­sued an ad­vi­sory to Mr Ong Ye Kung to re­mind him to com­ply with the law in re­la­tion to all cam­paign­ing ac­tiv­i­ties,” the two agen­cies said.</p>
    <p>“The po­lice have re­ceived a re­port in re­la­tion to Mr Ong’s video pub­lished on his Face­book page on July 2, 2020. As the ARO had looked into the mat­ter, the po­lice will not be tak­ing any fur­ther ac­tion.”</p>
    <p>Un­der Sec­tion 83(1) of the Par­lia­men­tary Elec­tions Act, pri­mary and sec­ondary school stu­dents are not al­lowed to take part in any elec­tion ac­tiv­ity.</p>
    <p>In the GE, Mr Ong led a five-man Peo­ple’s Ac­tion Party team that sought re-elec­tion in Sem­bawang GRC, se­cur­ing 67.29 per cent of the votes and de­feat­ing the Na­tional</p>
    <p>Sol­i­dar­ity Party team.</p>
    <p>On July 2, the third day of the cam­paign, he posted on and later re­moved from his Face­book page a three-minute video fea­tur­ing a young boy liv­ing in Sem­bawang, after he was in­formed the video vi­o­lated elec­tion rules.</p>
    <p>“I had a nice con­ver­sa­tion with a boy, Jony, who lives in Sem­bawang about how it is a good place to grow up. Jony is a great sport, we had a good chat, and we put up a short (video),” Mr Ong had ex­plained in a Face­book post. “How­ever, we have been in­formed by au­thor­i­ties that this is not in line with elec­toral rules. We have there­fore taken down the video. We are sorry for any in­con­ve­nience caused.”</p>
