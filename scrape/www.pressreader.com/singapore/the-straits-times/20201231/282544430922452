    <p>NEW YORK • One of the most im­por­tant ten­nis tour­na­ments will not take place in the United States this spring be­cause the coun­try has not been able to bring the coro­n­avirus pan­demic un­der control, of­fi­cials announced yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The BNP Paribas Open, sched­uled for In­dian Wells, Cal­i­for­nia, in March, has been post­poned, most likely un­til late next year.</p>
    <p>The ATP and WTA Tours have not announced a sub­sti­tute date but hope to do so in the com­ing weeks and months.</p>
    <p>“Al­ter­na­tive dates are be­ing as­sessed for the tour­na­ment to po­ten­tially take place later in the year,” the ATP said in a state­ment.</p>
    <p>In­dian Wells is not among the sport’s four Grand Slam tour­na­ments but it is in the next tier of im­por­tance for both the men and women’s tours.</p>
    <p>Of­fi­cials have scram­bled for weeks to try to find a way to sal­vage the event – this year’s edi­tion was can­celled – as rates of coro­n­avirus in­fec­tion con­tinue to in­crease across the coun­try, es­pe­cially in Cal­i­for­nia.</p>
    <p>The hard-court tour­na­ment, known in­for­mally as the “Fifth Slam”, rep­re­sents a rare chance to pro­mote the sport with nearly all of the top play­ers in the world par­tic­i­pat­ing.</p>
    <p>Now, these play­ers will most likely ap­pear at the Mi­ami Open in late March, as­sum­ing that tour­na­ment, which was also axed ear­lier this year, re­mains on the sched­ule.</p>
    <p>They will then re­turn after Wim­ble­don in mid­sum­mer for the hard-court sea­son that cul­mi­nates with the US Open in late Au­gust.</p>
    <p>The an­nounce­ment that In­dian Wells has been pushed back is the lat­est dis­rup­tion in a sport that was shut down for five months from March be­cause of the coro­n­avirus pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Now, the sched­ule for the first quar­ter of next year has es­sen­tially been re­drawn.</p>
    <p>The Aus­tralian Open has been moved from the last two weeks in Jan­uary to the mid­dle two weeks in Fe­bru­ary.</p>
    <p>Other events orig­i­nally planned for next year, like the ASB Clas­sic in Auck­land and the New York Open have also been canned, while the Ma­ha­rash­tra Open in In­dia is un­der a cloud and the Rio Open, ini­tially set for Fe­bru­ary, has been de­layed to a date yet to be con­firmed.</p>
    <p>This was re­flected in the ATP’s lat­est sched­ule for the next eight weeks that was re­leased on Tues­day.</p>
    <p>The cir­cuit said that “due to the im­pact of Covid-19”, the In­dian Wells event would not be held on</p>
    <p>“its cus­tom­ary dates in March”.</p>
    <p>Un­der the re­vised sched­ule, the week fol­low­ing the fi­nale of the Aus­tralian Open on Feb 21 will see tour­na­ments held in Cor­doba, Ar­gentina and Mont­pel­lier, France.</p>
    <p>They are to re­place events in San­ti­ago, Aca­pulco and Dubai, which have all been pushed back.</p>
    <p>Ten­nis of­fi­cials re­main hope­ful that after Mi­ami, the sport can em­bark on its usual clay-court sched­ule in the spring, with events in Monte Carlo, Madrid, Rome and then the French Open at Roland Gar­ros in Paris, which is sched­uled to be­gin in late May.</p>
    <p>How­ever, with only a par­tial sched­ule re­leased so far, the cal­en­dar re­mains sub­ject to change, given the un­pre­dictabil­ity of the Covid-19 cri­sis.</p>
