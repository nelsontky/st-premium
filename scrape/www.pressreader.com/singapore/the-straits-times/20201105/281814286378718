    <p>•</p>
    <p>VI­ENNA Aus­trian in­ves­ti­ga­tors have been piec­ing to­gether the Mon­day evening ram­page through cen­tral Vi­enna by a lone gun­man and later claimed by the Is­lamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS) group, as Chan­cel­lor Se­bas­tian Kurz called for a Euro­pean re­sponse to “po­lit­i­cal Is­lam”.</p>
    <p>Four peo­ple were killed when Ku­j­tim Fe­jzu­lai, de­scribed as a 20-year-old ISIS sym­pa­thiser who had spent time in prison, opened fire with a Kalash­nikov in a busy area of the Aus­trian cap­i­tal the day be­fore the coun­try went into a new coro­n­avirus lock­down.</p>
    <p>ISIS – which has claimed nu­mer­ous at­tacks in Europe – said on Tues­day a “soldier of the caliphate” was re­spon­si­ble for the car­nage, ac­cord­ing to its pro­pa­ganda agency.</p>
    <p>Vi­enna po­lice shot the gun­man dead on Mon­day and later swooped on 18 dif­fer­ent ad­dresses and made 14 ar­rests as they looked for pos­si­ble ac­com­plices and sought to de­ter­mine if he had acted alone.</p>
    <p>After re­view­ing closed-cir­cuit television footage of the at­tack in an area team­ing with bars and restau­rants not far from the his­toric sights of cen­tral Vi­enna, In­te­rior Min­is­ter Karl Ne­ham­mer said the video “does not at this time show any ev­i­dence of a sec­ond at­tacker”.</p>
    <p>The po­lice have asked peo­ple who filmed mo­ments of the at­tack to share their record­ings with the au­thor­i­ties to aid in track­ing the gun­man’s route through the cap­i­tal.</p>
    <p>On Fe­jzu­lai’s com­puter, in­ves­ti­ga­tors found in­crim­i­nat­ing ev­i­dence in­clud­ing a pho­to­graph re­cently posted on Face­book showing him car­ry­ing the au­to­matic weapon and a ma­chete used dur­ing the at­tack. The po­lice said he was also wear­ing a fake ex­plo­sive belt.</p>
    <p>Mr Kurz con­demned the shoot­ing as a “re­pul­sive ter­ror at­tack”, which he said killed a wait­ress, a young passer-by and an older man and woman.</p>
    <p>He called on the Euro­pean Union to fight against “po­lit­i­cal Is­lam” say­ing it was an ide­ol­ogy that rep­re­sented a “dan­ger” to the model of the Euro­pean way of life, in an in­ter­view pub­lished in Ger­many’s Die Welt news­pa­per.</p>
    <p>His gov­ern­ment will face ques­tions about how an in­di­vid­ual known to se­cu­rity forces had been able to buy weapons and cause havoc on the streets of the usu­ally peace­ful cap­i­tal, of­ten listed as hav­ing the world’s high­est qual­ity of life.</p>
    <p>The in­ves­ti­ga­tion is span­ning sev­eral coun­tries, with Switzer­land mak­ing two ar­rests and Mace­do­nia, where Fe­jzu­lai has fam­ily roots, co­op­er­at­ing with the Aus­trian au­thor­i­ties.</p>
    <p>The Swiss po­lice said in a state­ment that the 18-year-old and 24-year-old men, ar­rested in Win­terthur, about 10km from Zurich, are Swiss cit­i­zens.</p>
    <p>Swiss Jus­tice Min­is­ter Karin Keller-Sut­ter said the men were “ob­vi­ously friends” with Fe­jzu­lai. She added that the men had met in per­son, with­out say­ing when.</p>
    <p>The at­tack came after sev­eral Is­lamist atroc­i­ties in France, in­clud­ing an as­sault on church­go­ers in Nice and the be­head­ing of a school­teacher near Paris.</p>
    <p>The re­cent re­pub­li­ca­tion of car­toons of Prophet Muhammed in France has caused new ten­sions world­wide, spark­ing protests in some Mus­lim-ma­jor­ity coun­tries and calls from sev­eral ter­ror groups for their fol­low­ers to take re­venge.</p>
    <p>Britain on Tues­day up­graded its ter­ror­ism threat level from “sub­stan­tial” to “se­vere”.</p>
    <p>Mr Ne­ham­mer said Fe­jzu­lai had been con­victed and jailed for a ter­ror of­fence in April last year for try­ing to travel to Syria.</p>
    <p>The dual Aus­trian and Mace­do­nian na­tional had then been ad­mit­ted to a gov­ern­ment-funded de­rad­i­cal­i­sa­tion pro­gramme and had man­aged to se­cure an early re­lease next month from a 22-month prison sen­tence.</p>
    <p>“The per­pe­tra­tor man­aged to fool the de­rad­i­cal­i­sa­tion pro­gramme of the jus­tice sys­tem, to fool the peo­ple in it, and to get an early re­lease,” Mr Ne­ham­mer said.</p>
    <p>“It was clear that the at­tacker, de­spite all the out­ward signs of hav­ing in­te­grated into so­ci­ety, did ex­actly the op­po­site.”</p>
    <p>The small Alpine na­tion of nine mil­lion peo­ple had un­til now been spared the sort of ma­jor at­tacks that have hit other Euro­pean coun­tries such as France, Ger­many and Britain in the last decade.</p>
    <p>The last sig­nif­i­cant at­tacks date back to the 1970s and 1980s, and were car­ried out by pro-Pales­tinian mil­i­tants.</p>
    <p>The blood­shed trig­gered an out­pour­ing of sol­i­dar­ity from world lead­ers with French Pres­i­dent Em­manuel Macron say­ing the peo­ple of France shared the “shock and sor­row” of the Aus­trian peo­ple.</p>
    <p>Across Austria, flags were low­ered to half mast on public build­ings and peo­ple ob­served a minute of si­lence at noon as church bells rang out.</p>
    <p>Twenty-three wounded peo­ple were in hos­pi­tal on Tues­day, with seven in a crit­i­cal con­di­tion, Vi­enna’s hos­pi­tal as­so­ci­a­tion said.</p>
    <p>The po­lice said an of­fi­cer was among those hurt.</p>
