    <p>It is dis­ap­point­ing that af­ter all these years in Par­lia­ment, hav­ing 10 elected MPs and hav­ing Mr Pri­tam Singh ap­pointed Leader of the Op­po­si­tion, the Work­ers’ Party (WP) still has not des­ig­nated at least one shadow minister (WP in­tends to scru­ti­nise poli­cies and of­fer al­ter­na­tives, Sept 1).</p>
    <p>Hav­ing a shadow minister would help with the WP’s scru­ti­n­is­ing of poli­cies and pre­sent­ing of al­ter­na­tive views, and de­mon­strate a genuine in­ten­tion to run the coun­try in the fu­ture.</p>
    <p>Mr Singh says the WP does not have the re­sources. But the WP does not need to have the whole civil ser­vice at its dis­posal.</p>
    <p>All it needs is a small group of peo­ple to do in-depth re­search, seek feed­back from con­stituents and come up with good al­ter­na­tives.</p>
    <p>With the ex­ist­ing 13 leg­isla­tive as­sis­tants at the WP’s dis­posal, there are enough re­sources to form at least one shadow min­istry.</p>
    <p>If this shadow minister does a good job, Sin­ga­pore­ans can then en­trust the WP with more re­spon­si­bil­i­ties in fu­ture elec­tions. The WP can­not con­tinue to run “by-elec­tion” strate­gies for fu­ture gen­eral elec­tions.</p>
