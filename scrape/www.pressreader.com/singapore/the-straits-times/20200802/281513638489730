    <p>Some­times, all it takes is a big name to ring in busi­ness.</p>
    <p>Even as many food and bev­er­age out­lets here hol­low out and be­moan the loss of din­ers be­cause of the Covid-19 pan­demic, newly opened Lucali BYGB was packed and hop­ping the two times I was there.</p>
    <p>The new­comer started serv­ing its fa­mous piz­zas only about two weeks ago.</p>
    <p>But its celebrity sta­tus pre­cedes it, es­pe­cially after the orig­i­nal Lucali restau­rant by chef-owner Mark Ia­cono in Brook­lyn, New York, was fea­tured in Net­flix’s Ugly De­li­cious (2018) food doc­u­men­tary se­ries.</p>
    <p>The Sin­ga­pore out­let is a part­ner­ship with Mr Gi­bran Bay­doun, an Amer­i­can hos­pi­tal­ity en­tre­pre­neur who lives here. He adds on his ini­tials to the restau­rant’s name and runs the place.</p>
    <p>The menu is sim­ple. There is just one pizza ac­com­pa­nied by three sal­ads, three pas­tas, some sides and a cal­zone. Ev­ery­one or­ders the pizza, which is an 18-inch mon­ster, about 11/ times the size of the reg­u­lar 12-inch</p>
    <p>2 pie you find in most restau­rants.</p>
    <p>Even then, it is hard to jus­tify the $55 price tag for a ba­sic margherita pizza with just tomato sauce, moz­zarella cheese and basil leaves.</p>
    <p>Top­pings of pep­per­oni, onions, sweet pep­pers, mushrooms and an­chovies cost ex­tra – $5 each. If you have the works – and you might as well after shelling out so much for the base – you are look­ing at an $80 pizza, surely the most ex­pen­sive in town.</p>
    <p>This is sub­stan­tially more than at its New York restau­rant, where the ba­sic pie costs US$24 (S$33) and top­pings are US$3 each. But I guess since hol­i­day travel to the United States is not hap­pen­ing for a while, that is moot.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, en­joy a su­per-sized slice, while you try to swal­low your sticker shock.</p>
