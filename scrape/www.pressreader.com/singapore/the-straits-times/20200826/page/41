These are easy to do at home. The prevalence of social media has made news consumptio­n easier than ever. At such a time, learning of the daily cases has proven to be stressful for many. Hearing about the pandemic repeatedly can be upsetting. While it is imperative to acknowledg­e and internalis­e the effects of this disease, you should try not to let it consume you. Switch the content of your gaze from time to time. How are we all holding up? These are trying times for all. But if we are going to see this out, we will each be required to answer the call of individual responsibi­lity and civic mindedness. This means doing our part to stay home as far as possible and practising social distancing measures when outside the home to conduct essential tasks.
The following are a few ways you and your loved ones can stay calm, healthy and well-fed during these precarious times. Always remember, we are all in this together. Eat well We all got to eat, right? It may be a bit more challengin­g to get the food you want during this period, but what is comforting is the fact that several businesses continue to conduct operations through delivery and takeaway. This means you still get a semblance of normality while being able to enjoy the food you so dearly crave.
