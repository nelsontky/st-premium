    <p>•</p>
    <p>HONG KONG Lead­ing Hong Kong ac­tivist Joshua Wong was j ailed along­side two other young ac­tivists yes­ter­day for tak­ing part in last year’s huge democ­racy protests as the crack­down on Bei­jing’s crit­ics gath­ers pace.</p>
    <p>Wong, 24, was pros­e­cuted along­side fel­low ac­tivists Agnes Chow, 23, and Ivan Lam, 26, over a rally out­side the po­lice head­quar­ters.</p>
    <p>“The days ahead will be tough but we will hang in there,” Wong shouted as he was led away. The three pleaded guilty to var­i­ous charges in­clud­ing in­cit­ing an un­law­ful as­sem­bly.</p>
    <p>Mag­is­trate Wong Sze-lai said: “The de­fen­dants called on pro­test­ers to be­siege the head­quar­ters and chanted slo­gans that un­der­mine the po­lice force. Im­me­di­ate im­pris­on­ment is the only ap­pro­pri­ate op­tion.”</p>
    <p>She sen­tenced Wong to 131/</p>
    <p>2 months, Chow to 10 months, and Lam to seven months in jail.</p>
    <p>Chow burst into tears when the</p>
    <p>sen­tence was read out.</p>
    <p>Soon af­ter the sen­tenc­ing, Wong vowed to keep cam­paign­ing for democ­racy. “It’s not the end of the fight,” he wrote on his ver­i­fied Twit­ter ac­count in a mes­sage con­veyed by lawyers.</p>
    <p>Last year, Hong Kong was con­vulsed by seven straight months of huge and of­ten vi­o­lent ral­lies in which mil­lions took to the streets.</p>
    <p>Bei­jing has re­fused de­mands for univer­sal suf­frage and the au­thor­i­ties have pur­sued democ­racy sup­port­ers with crim­i­nal cases and a tough new se­cu­rity law.</p>
    <p>The tac­tics have sti­fled the move­ment and re­stored a sem­blance of calm. But the fi­nan­cial hub re­mains deeply polarised, with many still seething against Bei­jing’s grow­ing hold on the semi-au­tonomous city.</p>
    <p>Wong has al­ready spent time in prison for lead­ing democ­racy protests and has said he is pre­pared for more time be­hind bars.</p>
    <p>“All these pains and suf­fer­ings would only strengthen our courage and con­vic­tion for democ­racy and jus­tice,” he wrote on Twit­ter on Mon­day.</p>
    <p>Wong, Chow and Lam joined Hong Kong’s pro-democ­racy move­ment when they were in their teens.</p>
    <p>They or­gan­ised suc­cess­ful ral­lies in 2012 against plans to make Hong Kong’s ed­u­ca­tion sys­tem more “pa­tri­otic”. And they played prom­i­nent roles two years later in the Um­brella Move­ment – a 79-day peace­ful oc­cu­pa­tion by a largely stu­dent-led campaign calling for univer­sal suf­frage.</p>
    <p>Lead­ing fig­ures from those protests, in­clud­ing Wong, were jailed and the democ­racy move­ment strug­gled in the years af­ter.</p>
    <p>But it ex­ploded onto the streets once more i n June l ast year, sparked by plans to al­low ex­tra­di­tions to China and con­cerns over its opaque le­gal sys­tem.</p>
    <p>Mil­lions took to the streets over the next seven months in a de­lib­er­ately lead­er­less campaign mostly or­gan­ised via so­cial me­dia, calling for greater democ­racy and po­lice ac­count­abil­ity.</p>
    <p>Fig­ures such as Wong and Chow joined some of the protests and also used their celebrity sta­tus over the years to lobby for in­ter­na­tional sanc­tions, a move that in­fu­ri­ated Bei­jing with state me­dia cast­ing them as traitors.</p>
    <p>Ear­lier this sum­mer, Bei­jing im­posed a broad se­cu­rity law which ramps up its di­rect con­trol over the city and out­laws cer­tain po­lit­i­cal views. More than 10,000 peo­ple have been ar­rested over the last 18 months, and most of Hong Kong’s lead­ing ac­tivists and op­po­si­tion fig­ures face pros­e­cu­tion.</p>
    <p>“The sup­pres­sion is not only tar­get­ing prom­i­nent fig­ures. It comes from all di­rec­tions and is go­ing af­ter all kinds of peo­ple,” Mr Isaac Cheng, a friend of Wong’s and for­mer vice-chair­man of their now-de­funct po­lit­i­cal party De­mo­sisto, told Agence France-Presse.</p>
    <p>Chow is be­ing in­ves­ti­gated un­der the se­cu­rity law for al­legedly “con­spir­ing with for­eign forces” by push­ing for sanc­tions.</p>
    <p>Wong is among another group of ac­tivists be­ing pros­e­cuted for a vigil ear­lier this year mark­ing the an­niver­sary of Bei­jing’s 1989 Tianan­men crack­down.</p>
    <p>Bei­jing says se­cu­rity has been re­stored in the city.</p>
    <p>But Mr Cheng de­scribed a sense of de­spon­dency among many younger Hong Kongers. “We thought this place be­longs to us, but it now turns out to be a crime if a stu­dent thinks dif­fer­ently from the gov­ern­ment,” he said.</p>
