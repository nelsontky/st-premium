    <p>TOKYO • Ja­pan’s daily coro­n­avirus tally is on the rise, with at least 1,328 new cases yes­ter­day, the third straight day of a na­tional caseload above 1,000.</p>
    <p>Such fig­ures, un­seen since Au­gust, have raised con­cerns of a third wave of in­fec­tions amid the on­set of cooler tem­per­a­tures. More than 100 new clus­ters were dis­cov­ered over the past week.</p>
    <p>“We have to watch the sit­u­a­tion with a stronger sense of cau­tion than be­fore,” Prime Min­is­ter Yoshi­hide Suga said on Fri­day. And top gov­ern­ment spokesman Kat­sunobu Kato added that the gov­ern­ment was “spar­ing no ef­fort” to curb the out­break.</p>
    <p>How­ever, a sus­pen­sion of the multi-bil­lion dol­lar Go To Travel cam­paign – to re­sus­ci­tate the ail­ing hospi­tal­ity in­dus­try – does not ap­pear to be on the cards.</p>
    <p>While Ja­pan has avoided the ex­plo­sive growth in cases else­where, it has been one of the hard­est-hit in East Asia. It has also been more lais­sez-faire in its re­sponse.</p>
    <p>South Korea, which has just en­acted new five-tier so­cial dis­tanc­ing guide­lines, had 89 cases yes­ter­day, bring­ing its to­tal to 27,284.</p>
    <p>China re­ported no lo­cal trans­mis­sions on the main­land on Fri­day, with all of its 33 new cases im­ported. The tally stands at 86,184.</p>
    <p>Out­pac­ing both coun­tries is Ja­pan, with 107,554 cases as of last night.</p>
    <p>Tokyo, which ac­counts for nearly one in three cases, re­ported 294 new cases yes­ter­day with sev­eral traced to Hal­loween par­ties.</p>
    <p>Hokkaido and Kana­gawa both posted new daily highs, with 187 and 137 cases re­spec­tively.</p>
    <p>Mr Naomichi Suzuki, the Gov­er­nor of Hokkaido, has re­quested that food and bev­er­age out­lets in the Susukino nightlife district in Sap­poro shorten their busi­ness hours.</p>
