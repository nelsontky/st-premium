    <p>Astint in the A&E depart­ment of a pub­lic hospital when he was 27 con­vinced Mr Ashvin Vardza Raju he thrives in a fast-paced work­ing en­vi­ron­ment.</p>
    <p>“Dur­ing that ro­ta­tion, I re­alised that I en­joyed the rigour of shift work,” he says. “Af­ter com­plet­ing my Na­tional Ser­vice in 2018, I de­cided to be part of an emer­gency medicine unit and have never left since.”</p>
    <p>Be­fore his na­tional ser­vice, he had a com­pul­sory ro­ta­tion in emer­gency medicine as a med­i­cal of­fi­cer.</p>
    <p>Dr Ashvin, 30, is cur­rently a hospital clin­i­cian with Wood­lands Health Campus. With the hospital sched­uled to open pro­gres­sively from 2023, he is cur­rently sta­tioned at Sengkang Gen­eral Hospital.</p>
    <p>His pri­mary role in­volves re­ceiv­ing A&E pa­tients with all kinds of med­i­cal con­di­tions, com­ing up with a timely and ac­cu­rate di­ag­no­sis and rec­om­mend­ing the best treat­ment plans for them.</p>
    <p>Though the job might sound stress­ful to some, Dr Ashvin is un­daunted by the pres­sure. He ex­plains that he’s al­ways been a prob­lem solver at heart.</p>
    <p>“I en­joy tak­ing on chal­lenges, and this pro­fes­sion al­lows me to chal­lenge my­self and help peo­ple at the same time,” he says. “We of­ten look af­ter many pa­tients within a 12-hour shift, and are re­quired to make a pro­vi­sional di­ag­no­sis as ac­cu­rately as pos­si­ble.”</p>
    <p>One par­tic­u­larly mem­o­rable and chal­leng­ing case he en­coun­tered was when his team needed to trans­fer a preg­nant lady who had met with a road ac­ci­dent to another hospital. The trans­fer went smoothly, and the pa­tient reached the other hospital safe and well.</p>
    <p>How­ever, the team wit­nessed another road ac­ci­dent on the way back. They im­me­di­ately stopped to of­fer as­sis­tance, eval­u­at­ing the driver and pas­sen­ger to make sure there were no life-threat­en­ing in­juries. They also stayed with the ca­su­al­ties un­til the ar­rival of the Sin­ga­pore Civil De­fence Force am­bu­lance.</p>
    <p>“We im­me­di­ately stopped to of­fer as­sis­tance, eval­u­at­ing the driver and pas­sen­ger to make sure there were no life-threat­en­ing in­juries,” he re­counts. “We also stayed with the ca­su­al­ties un­til the ar­rival of the SCDF Sin­ga­pore Civil De­fence Force am­bu­lance.</p>
    <p>“The ex­pe­ri­ence taught me to think on my feet, re­act to dif­fer­ent med­i­cal cases and make sound clinical judge­ments within a short turn­around time,” re­flects Dr Ashvin.</p>
    <p>Go­ing for­ward, Dr Ashvin hopes to fur­ther ad­vance his skills so that he can pro­vide the best care for pa­tients. He has been ac­cepted into the 2020 Hospital Clin­i­cian Scheme, a newly-de­vel­oped ca­reer track to re­tain non-spe­cial­ist doc­tors, ex­pand­ing their job role and recog­nis­ing the larger re­spon­si­bil­i­ties they take on.</p>
    <p>Un­der this scheme, doc­tors re­ceive broad-based train­ing to work ef­fec­tively across re­lated dis­ci­plines and care set­tings. At a se­nior level, clin­i­cians will deep-dive into dis­ci­plines of their in­ter­est and un­der­take more com­plex care roles, giv­ing them the flex­i­bil­ity to be de­ployed across dif­fer­ent care set­tings.</p>
    <p>“The scheme en­ables me to pur­sue my in­ter­est in emer­gency care with en­larged job re­spon­si­bil­i­ties,” says Dr Ashvin. “I’ll also have the op­por­tu­nity to prac­tice in gen­eral medicine, giv­ing me wider ex­po­sure to more clinical con­di­tions.”</p>
    <p>He adds, “Ex­po­sure in th­ese two dis­ci­plines will en­hance my pro­fes­sional ca­reer, and fur­ther in­crease my job sat­is­fac­tion.”</p>
