    <p>From an old bus stop sign to a ticket ma­chine-turned­cab­i­net, the study room of Mr San­thosh Ku­mar’s five­room Hous­ing Board flat is a tes­ta­ment to the 21-yearold stu­dent’s ob­ses­sion with buses.</p>
    <p>The room is decked out in or­ange and yel­low fur­nish­ings, which pay homage to the colours of the for­mer Trans-Is­land Bus Ser­vices. Old bus seats have been taste­fully re­pur­posed into desk chairs and booth seats.</p>
    <p>The cup­boards are filled with bus mem­o­ra­bilia, each one a slice of his­tory. Th­ese range from des­ti­na­tion signs and li­cence plates of de­funct ser­vices to a poster show­ing how the op­er­at­ing hours of ser­vice 111 would have been af­fected by the state fu­neral of for­mer prime min­is­ter Lee Kuan Yew in 2015.</p>
    <p>There is also a li­cence, from the days be­fore Elec­tronic Road Pric­ing, which granted its ve­hi­cle en­try to the Cen­tral Busi­ness Dis­trict dur­ing re­stricted hours.</p>
    <p>“Buses were a gate­way for me to ex­plore Sin­ga­pore,” says Mr Ku­mar, who stud­ies ad­ver­tis­ing and pub­lic re­la­tions at Ngee Ann Polytech­nic. “I was drawn to the artis­tic look of them, like the colours of the Tran­sIs­land buses, which had a green in­te­rior.</p>
    <p>“I can’t pre­serve an en­tire bus, so col­lect­ing parts is the next best thing.”</p>
    <p>His fas­ci­na­tion with buses be­gan when he was a child. By pri­mary school, he was al­ready on on­line bus in­ter­est fo­rums. In Pri­mary 6, he started bus-spot­ting with a cam­era.</p>
    <p>In his teens, he be­gan col­lect­ing parts, haul­ing out li­cence plates, des­ti­na­tion signs, seats and ticket ma­chines from scrap­yards in Kranji. “At first, my par­ents were like, why are you bring­ing back all this dirty stuff? But they got used to it.”</p>
    <p>Th­ese days, he is more se­lec­tive about what he keeps. “The thing about col­lect­ing all th­ese mem­o­ra­bilia is that if you try to put it all in a room, it of­ten just looks like a mess,” says Mr Ku­mar, who is go­ing for a vi­brant, “cafe-like” vibe in his room.</p>
    <p>While he might not be old enough to re­mem­ber much of Sin­ga­pore’s bus his­tory, he reads widely and has amassed a trove of bus trivia.</p>
    <p>He laments the phas­ing out of the old bendy buses – some of which were de­signed by Pin­in­fa­rina, the master Ital­ian de­signer of Fer­rari cars.</p>
    <p>He hopes more will be done to pre­serve Sin­ga­pore’s bus her­itage. He notes that a de­com­mis­sioned SBS Tran­sit bus was re­cently spot­ted on Hong Kong roads (it was re­port­edly bought by a bus col­lec­tor). Some old Sin­ga­pore buses have also ended up in Thai­land.</p>
    <p>He dreams of hav­ing “bus her­itage days” in Sin­ga­pore, dur­ing which the au­thor­i­ties would take out old buses and let peo­ple ride on them. Such events are al­ready held in cities like Lon­don.</p>
