    <p>Early child­hood ed­u­ca­tor Koh Jia Min wanted to bet­ter un­der­stand how to teach her stu­dents with spe­cial needs, so she pur­sued and earned a bach­e­lor’s in spe­cial ed­u­ca­tion to do just that.</p>
    <p>Al­lied ed­u­ca­tor Li Ji­ayi wanted to com­mu­ni­cate bet­ter with stu­dents with hear­ing loss, so she learnt sign lan­guage.</p>
    <p>For go­ing be­yond the call of duty in their work, Ms Koh, 31, and Ms Li, 29, were two of four ed­u­ca­tors who re­ceived the Lead­ing Foun­da­tion Teacher Award yes­ter­day at a cer­e­mony held at the Na­tional In­sti­tute of Ed­u­ca­tion in Jurong.</p>
    <p>The award, which is into its sev­enth year, hon­ours ed­u­ca­tors who have gone above and be­yond to make a pos­i­tive im­pact on the lives of those un­der their care.</p>
    <p>Re­cip­i­ents are each given a cash award of $2,500 and an award cer­tifi­cate.</p>
    <p>The Lead­ing Foun­da­tion was es­tab­lished in 2013 by Mr Lim Siong Guan, a former top civil ser­vant who is now a pro­fes­sor at the Lee Kuan Yew School of Pub­lic Pol­icy, and Ms Joanne Lim, founder of lo­cal con­sul­tancy The Right Per­spec­tive.</p>
    <p>The foun­da­tion sup­ports pro­grammes in ed­u­ca­tion and lead­er­ship, with a par­tic­u­lar fo­cus on ed­u­ca­tors.</p>
    <p>The two other award re­cip­i­ents yes­ter­day were Ms Elaine Chong Yu­lian of St James’ Church Kinder­garten and Ms Tan Pek Keow of St An­drew’s Autism School.</p>
    <p>Ms Chong, 29, had taken a pay cut to be­come an early child­hood ed­u­ca­tor af­ter be­ing in the mar­ket­ing and com­mu­ni­ca­tions sec­tor for more than six years.</p>
    <p>Ms Tan, 51, made a ca­reer switch al­most 10 years ago from in­for­ma­tion tech­nol­ogy qual­ity as­sur­ance to work­ing as a teacher’s aide, be­fore be­com­ing a teacher.</p>
    <p>She is cur­rently heav­ily in­volved in lead­ing a par­ent sup­port group to help fam­i­lies that have chil­dren with autism cope with trav­el­ling on air­planes.</p>
    <p>Ms Koh, who is now teach­ing dif­fer­en­ti­ated learn­ing to chil­dren with vary­ing learn­ing needs at PAP Com­mu­nity Foun­da­tion Sparkle­tots Preschool in Choa Chu Kang, said of her mo­ti­va­tion to know more: “I had two stu­dents with spe­cial ed­u­ca­tion needs... so I felt that I should pur­sue (knowl­edge) and un­der­stand more about them as an ed­u­ca­tor.”</p>
    <p>Ms Li, an al­lied ed­u­ca­tor pro­vid­ing learn­ing and be­havioural sup­port at Ou­tram Sec­ondary School, said the tran­si­tion from be­ing a be­havioural ther­a­pist in the pri­vate sec­tor to work­ing at the school, where she sup­ports stu­dents with spe­cial needs in adapt­ing to and in­te­grat­ing into main­stream schools, has been chal­leng­ing.</p>
    <p>“There’s just one of me. But the num­ber of stu­dents di­ag­nosed with spe­cial needs has in­creased” – from 80, when she joined the school in 2016, to 100 this year.</p>
    <p>But she has been do­ing more where she can.</p>
    <p>She or­gan­ised a school car­ni­val last year to raise aware­ness about spe­cial needs and ini­ti­ated “cooldown cor­ners” for stu­dents who need time and space to reg­u­late their emo­tions.</p>
    <p>She cred­ited sup­port­ive teach­ers with aid­ing her en­deav­ours.</p>
    <p>She added: “I’ve learnt a lot from the par­ents them­selves. A lot of them know more than I do.”</p>
