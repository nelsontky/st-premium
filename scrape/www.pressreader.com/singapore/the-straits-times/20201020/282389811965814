    <p>NEW YORK • When artist Lu­ciano Gar­bati made his sculp­ture of Me­dusa hold­ing Perseus’ sev­ered head – an in­ver­sion of the cen­turies-old myth – fem­i­nism was not what he had in mind.</p>
    <p>He was not think­ing of the #MeToo move­ment ei­ther: Gar­bati had cre­ated the work i n 2008, nearly a decade be­fore the move­ment went main­stream.</p>
    <p>Gar­bati, an Ar­gen­tine artist with Ital­ian roots, was in­spired by a 16th­cen­tury bronze: Ben­venuto Cellini’s Perseus With The Head Of Me­dusa. In that work, a nude Perseus holds up Me­dusa’s head by her snaky mane.</p>
    <p>Gar­bati con­ceived of a sculp­ture that could re­verse that story, imag­in­ing it from Me­dusa’s per­spec­tive and re­veal­ing the woman be­hind the mon­ster.</p>
    <p>Last Tues­day, his sculp­ture – Me­dusa With The Head Of Perseus – was reimag­ined as a sym­bol of tri­umph for vic­tims of sex­ual as­sault, when it was un­veiled in lower Man­hat­tan, j ust across the road from the crim­i­nal court­house on Cen­tre Street.</p>
    <p>A news re­lease ad­ver­tised the statue as an “icon of jus­tice”, not­ing that the tow­er­ing, nearly 2.1m-tall Me­dusa stood across from the build­ing where men ac­cused of sex­ual as­sault dur­ing the #MeToo move­ment were pros­e­cuted, in­clud­ing Har­vey We­in­stein, who had been con­victed of two felony sex crimes there in Fe­bru­ary. (The idea for the site pre­dated the trial, but the sen­ti­ment re­mained.)</p>
    <p>Standing in the cen­tre of Col­lect Pond Park, Me­dusa – her gaze low and in­tense – holds a sword in her left hand and Perseus’ head in her right. The head was de­signed af­ter the artist him­self – a con­ve­nient model.</p>
    <p>In his ap­pli­ca­tion to the city’s Art in the Parks pro­gramme, which re­views pro­pos­als for pub­lic art in­stal­la­tions like this one, Gar­bati noted that Me­dusa had been raped by Po­sei­don i n the Tem­ple of Athena, ac­cord­ing to the myth.</p>
    <p>As pun­ish­ment, Athena turned her wrath on Me­dusa, trans­form­ing her hair into snakes. The ap­pli­ca­tion stated that the story had “com­mu­ni­cated to women for mil­len­nia that if they are raped, it is their fault”.</p>
    <p>At last Tues­day’s un­veil­ing in the park, where the statue will stand until the end of April, Gar­bati talked about the thou­sands of women who had writ­ten to him about the sculp­ture. Many saw the im­age as cathar­tic, he said.</p>
    <p>But for some on­line com­men­ta­tors, the sculp­ture did not quite meet the mo­ment.</p>
    <p>As news about the sculp­ture’s planned in­stal­la­tion spread, ac­tivists and ob­servers on so­cial me­dia won­dered why a piece of art meant to hon­our the #MeToo move­ment – which was an­i­mated, in large part, by an out­pour­ing of per­sonal sto­ries from women – was cre­ated by a man.</p>
    <p>Oth­ers won­dered why, if the sculp­ture was in­tended to be about sex­ual vi­o­lence, Me­dusa car­ried the head of Perseus and not Po­sei­don, her rapist. And some ques­tioned the de­ci­sion to de­pict Me­dusa as a lithe, clas­si­cally beau­ti­ful nude fig­ure when she was de­scribed as a mon­ster.</p>
    <p>Gar­bati said in an interview that, by now, his sculp­ture had a life of its own cre­ated by out­siders’ ob­ser­va­tions and in­ter­pre­ta­tions.</p>
    <p>“I would say I am hon­oured by the fact that the sculp­ture has been cho­sen as a sym­bol,” he said.</p>
    <p>He noted how the project had helped him re­alise that he was a “prod­uct of a pa­tri­ar­chal so­ci­ety” him­self.</p>
    <p>As for mytho­log­i­cal ac­cu­racy, Gar­bati said his work was a direct re­sponse to Cellini’s sculp­ture, which de­picts the story of Perseus slaying Me­dusa and then us­ing her sev­ered head as a weapon, har­ness­ing her power of turn­ing people to stone with her stare.</p>
    <p>Re­gard­ing Me­dusa’s mod­e­lesque fig­ure, Gar­bati sug­gests that crit­ics con­sider the lit­er­a­ture from a re­cent ex­hi­bi­tion at the Metropoli­tan Mu­seum of Art that chron­i­cles how artis­tic depic­tions of Me­dusa mor­phed from beastly to beau­ti­ful start­ing in the fifth cen­tury B.C.</p>
    <p>In 2018, a decade af­ter the cre­ation of the orig­i­nal resin sculp­ture, images of Gar­bati’s sculp­ture be­gan to spread on­line. It gained meme sta­tus af­ter he posted pho­tos of the work on Face­book, and it was used as a sym­bol of fe­male rage at the height of the #MeToo move­ment.</p>
    <p>Bek An­der­sen, a pho­tog­ra­pher who worked with Gar­bati to in­stall the sculp­ture, is not both­ered by the gen­der of the artist.</p>
    <p>“To me, it’s ex­cit­ing that the artist is a man,” she said. “I think men feel left out of the #MeToo con­ver­sa­tion, and I think they’re afraid of what it means for them.”</p>
