    <p>NUM­BER OF YEARS ONUMA DEPART­MENT STORE HAS BEEN IN BUSI­NESS IN YA­M­A­GATA, JAPAN</p>
    <p>TOKYO • Af­ter more than three cen­turies in busi­ness, the Onuma depart­ment store in the north­ern Ja­panese city of Ya­m­a­gata be­gan bank­ruptcy pro­ceed­ings this year – one of many dis­tin­guished depart­ment stores across the coun­try in dire straits.</p>
    <p>Known for their fancy food halls, lux­ury items, im­pec­ca­ble ser­vice and, in their hey­day, rooftop at­trac­tions to en­ter­tain fam­i­lies, Japan’s depart­ment stores have been in a long slow de­cline as shop­ping habits change.</p>
    <p>Now the coro­n­avirus pan­demic, just as it has forced Amer­i­can re­tail­ers such as Lord & Tay­lor and Neiman Mar­cus into bank­ruptcy, is ham­mer­ing nails into coffins for some – par­tic­u­larly those in re­gional ar­eas.</p>
    <p>Last month, 146-year-old Nak­ago closed its last re­main­ing store in Fukushima city, also in the north, while Izut­suya, a chain in the south­ern city of Kita Kyushu, shut­tered one of its two main stores.</p>
    <p>“Ev­ery­one agrees it’s very dis­ap­point­ing, but the truth is that peo­ple haven’t been shop­ping at these stores lately,” said re­tail con­sul­tant Shuhei Ya­mashita, who hopes to buy the Onuma depart­ment store from cred­i­tors and turn it around.</p>
    <p>This year, with con­sumers wary of shop­ping and tourism dec­i­mated amid the pan­demic, sales have plunged. In­dus­try sales dropped by a fifth in July from a year ear­lier and pol­i­cy­mak­ers fear more store clo­sures and bank­rupt­cies are in­evitable.</p>
    <p>Even be­fore this year’s woes, Ja­panese depart­ment stores have strug­gled to stay rel­e­vant, selling items such as US$10,000 (S$13,600) ki­monos and posh table­ware to main­tain their ca­chet even as con­sumer tastes have turned to­wards more in­for­mal items. At the same time, con­sumers have taken much of their shop­ping on­line.</p>
    <p>Both in­dus­try-wide sales and store num­bers have tum­bled 30 per cent since 1999. Some of the coun­try’s 203 depart­ment stores have also dras­ti­cally shrunk floor space by bring­ing in other ten­ants.</p>
    <p>Big na­tional chains and stores in ma­jor cities have not been im­mune. Ise­tan Mit­sukoshi Hold­ings, for ex­am­ple, has closed sev­eral stores over the past decade and said in March it would close a Mit­sukoshi store in down­town Tokyo next year.</p>
    <p>How­ever, it is the prospects for re­gional stores and the im­pli­ca­tions for their lo­cal economies – al­ready wracked by decades of de­fla­tion, anaemic growth and an ex­o­dus of young peo­ple search­ing for bet­ter jobs – which are caus­ing the most con­cern.</p>
    <p>Pol­i­cy­mak­ers fret that store fail­ures may sow seeds of cri­sis, ex­ac­er­bat­ing pain felt through­out a lo­cal econ­omy to the point that be­lea­guered re­gional lenders will not be able to cope with in­creases in non-per­form­ing loans.</p>
    <p>“Clo­sures will weigh on prop­erty prices, jobs and many other as­pects of an al­ready weak­en­ing re­gional econ­omy,” said a gov­ern­ment of­fi­cial with ex­per­tise in re­gional fi­nance.</p>
    <p>Japan’s Chief Cab­i­net Sec­re­tary Yoshi­hide Suga, the front run­ner to be­come the coun­try’s new prime min­is­ter this month, has made re­vi­tal­is­ing re­gional economies a key pol­icy pri­or­ity.</p>
    <p>But whether any of the gov­ern­ment’s pledge of US$2.2 tril­lion in stim­u­lus for pan­demic-hit com­pa­nies finds its way to depart­ment stores re­mains an open ques­tion, with some gov­ern­ment of­fi­cials and politi­cians pri­vately say­ing that the money needs to be fun­nelled to­wards more vi­able in­dus­tries.</p>
    <p>In Ya­m­a­gata, the fu­ture of the Onuma depart­ment store re­mains un­clear. Al­though Mr Ya­mashita’s com­pany is keen to keep the store go­ing, cred­i­tors could opt to sell to a higher-pay­ing bid­der.</p>
    <p>Some lo­cals seem re­signed to Onuma’s fail­ure, say­ing it had failed to keep up with chang­ing life­styles, in­clud­ing the rise of on­line re­tail­ers and faster trans­port links to big­ger cities. “In­fras­truc­ture, trans­porta­tion, life­styles, in­for­ma­tion, cul­ture, val­ues – ev­ery­thing has changed,” Mr Takashi Inoue, pres­i­dent of a metal pro­cess­ing com­pany in Ya­m­a­gata, wrote in a blog as he lamented Onuma’s bank­ruptcy.</p>
    <p>Still, Mr Ya­mashita is not giv­ing up hope that cred­i­tors will be con­vinced by his plans to re­vamp the store. “It’s a place peo­ple once loved,” he said. “It will be a shame if it be­comes just an­other high-rise de­vel­op­ment.”</p>
