    <p>Close to 1.3 bil­lion tonnes of food is wasted ev­ery year, even as more than 800 mil­lion peo­ple world­wide go to bed hun­gry ev­ery night. In this fourth in­stal­ment of a six-part se­ries on food waste, The Sun­day Times, in part­ner­ship with DBS Bank, takes a close look at su­per­mar­kets, which have been sin­gled out as a ma­jor cul­prit glob­ally for throw­ing out per­fectly ed­i­ble food. Vanessa Liu and Ju­dith Tan speak to su­per­mar­ket chains, food char­i­ties and stake­hold­ers here to find out how they are work­ing to­gether to re­solve the is­sue.</p>
    <p>Crushed ce­real boxes, dented tuna cans and torn la­bels. These are things you rarely see on su­per­mar­ket shelves in Sin­ga­pore, and it is not by chance. Items deemed not good enough to sell are sieved out by su­per­mar­kets dur­ing the qual­ity con­trol process.</p>
    <p>In the past, most of these items would have ended up in the trash. But as the is­sue of waste gains trac­tion among the buy­ing pub­lic, things are slowly chang­ing.</p>
    <p>Since 2015, su­per­mar­ket chain FairPrice has been work­ing with food char­ity Food from the Heart (FFTH) to re­di­rect items from its 140-odd out­lets is­land­wide to fam­i­lies and in­di­vid­u­als who need them.</p>
    <p>FFTH chief ex­ec­u­tive Sim Bee Hia told The Sun­day Times that about $18,000 to $24,000 worth of food, in­clud­ing sta­ples and canned food, is given away ev­ery month to its part­ners via this pro­gramme.</p>
    <p>Food items with dam­aged pack­ag­ing are not the only things that su­per­mar­kets ditch.</p>
    <p>Tonnes of pro­duce are thrown out be­cause of poor in­ven­tory man­age­ment such as over-or­der­ing, or be­cause of cos­metic fil­ter­ing, where pro­duce that is ed­i­ble but blem­ished or of the wrong size is re­jected.</p>
    <p>Su­per­mar­kets have long been fin­gered as a ma­jor cul­prit of food waste. In 2016, France made head­lines by be­com­ing the first coun­try to ban su­per­mar­kets from throw­ing away un­sold food. A law was in­tro­duced to force these busi­nesses to do­nate the food to char­i­ties or food banks.</p>
    <p>The Sun­day Times un­der­stands that at a cen­tral ware­house of a su­per­mar­ket chain here, about 15 to 20 pal­lets of pro­duce are re­jected ev­ery day. Each pal­let can con­tain any­where be­tween 500kg and one tonne of pro­duce. The pro­duce might be re­jected be­cause it does not meet stan­dards set by the su­per­mar­kets. For in­stance, some su­per­mar­kets ac­cept ba­nanas from sup­pli­ers only when they are to­tally green, with­out a tinge of yel­low, so that they can ripen on the shelves.</p>
    <p>Mr Jonas Kor, di­rec­tor of cor­po­rate com­mu­ni­ca­tions at FairPrice, said the su­per­mar­ket chain has since 2015 been sell­ing slightly blem­ished fruits and veg­eta­bles at lower prices un­der its “Great Taste, Less Waste” ini­tia­tive. Last year, it saved about 778,000kg of fruits and veg­eta­bles un­der this ini­tia­tive.</p>
    <p>Mr Kor said the chain’s e-com­merce plat­form, FairPrice On­line, also sells off-sea­son items and near-ex­piry items un­der its clear­ance sale sec­tion. “Food waste is a per­ti­nent is­sue that re­quires sus­tained and con­certed ef­forts from in­dus­try play­ers, gov­ern­ment agen­cies and the com­mu­nity.”</p>
    <p>Last year, FairPrice stores gen­er­ated 2,940 tonnes of food waste, com­pared with 3,170 tonnes in 2018, and 2,700 tonnes in 2017.</p>
    <p>The other ma­jor chains, Sheng Siong and Dairy Farm Group, the lat­ter of which runs the Cold Stor­age and Gi­ant su­per­mar­ket stores, de­clined to say how much food waste they gen­er­ate ev­ery year.</p>
    <p>A spokesman for the Na­tional En­vi­ron­ment Agency (NEA) said it does not have a break­down of the amount of food waste gen­er­ated by the su­per­mar­ket chains here, but es­ti­mates that 40 per cent of the food waste gen­er­ated in Sin­ga­pore is from the com­mer­cial and in­dus­trial sec­tors, which in­clude su­per­mar­kets.</p>
    <p>The spokesman added that from 2024, own­ers and oc­cu­piers of shop­ping malls, in­clud­ing su­per­mar­kets, that gen­er­ate large amounts of food waste will have to seg­re­gate it for treat­ment. He said NEA will en­gage these stake­hold­ers to get them to in­cor­po­rate work­flows that seg­re­gate food waste in their busi­ness op­er­a­tions and to adopt food waste re­cy­cling ini­tia­tives.</p>
    <p>“One of the chal­lenges su­per­mar­kets face is the mar­ket de­mand for and treat­ment of pro­duce that may have some blem­ishes or do not look aes­thet­i­cally pleas­ing.</p>
    <p>“This is where con­sumers can also con­trib­ute to the food waste re­duc­tion ef­forts. It starts with an un­der­stand­ing and ac­cep­tance that odd-look­ing or even blem­ished fruits and veg­eta­bles can be trimmed and are still ed­i­ble.”</p>
    <p>A spokesman for Sheng Siong said it sells food with im­per­fec­tions but which is still whole­some un­der re­duced-to-clear sec­tions.</p>
    <p>Food prod­ucts that can­not be con­sumed any more are sep­a­rated from their pack­ag­ing and sent to be re­cy­cled into use­ful by-prod­ucts by Sheng Siong’s waste man­age­ment part­ner, he added.</p>
    <p>A Dairy Farm spokesman said the com­pany was “com­mit­ted to re­duc­ing wastage across our stores” and has im­ple­mented mea­sures such as re­cy­cling pack­ag­ing ma­te­rial wher­ever pos­si­ble, tai­lor­ing in­ven­tory man­age­ment to each store, as well as pur­chas­ing plan­ning.</p>
    <p>RedMart’s head of gro­cery Richard Ruddy said that be­cause all its prod­ucts are in one ware­house, it is able to see an ag­gre­ga­tion of con­sumer de­mand and pre­dict or­ders more ac­cu­rately.</p>
    <p>“With nine years of data on con­sumer pref­er­ences, we are able to fore­cast de­mand down to the num­ber of car­tons of milk that will be pur­chased for a day.”</p>
    <p>He added that com­pared with a con­ven­tional mar­ket, the on­line gro­cery plat­form does not “need to stock up shelves across dozens of stores with fresh pro­duce, of which not ev­ery­thing is sold and ul­ti­mately goes to waste”.</p>
    <p>RedMart, owned by Lazada, said it works with so­cial en­ter­prise Ugly-Food to re­sell some of the pro­duce with slight im­per­fec­tions at dis­counted prices. It also works with lo­cal start-up Crust Brew­ing to turn bread near­ing ex­piry into beer.</p>
    <p>Apart from su­per­mar­kets, bak­eries here also throw out dozens of un­sold bread items at the end of the busi­ness day.</p>
    <p>FFTH has worked with bak­ery chains such as Bread­Talk and Swiss­bake, as well as smaller neigh­bour­hood bak­eries and ho­tel buf­fet lines, to save bread from this fate with its 17-year-old Bread Run pro­gramme. Its pool of vol­un­teers can­vass more than 100 bak­eries ev­ery night to pick up bags of un­sold bread and de­liver them to wel­fare homes and half­way houses, as well as com­mu­nity part­ners to get them to fam­i­lies in need.</p>
    <p>About 28,000kg of bread des­tined for the bins is sal­vaged in this man­ner ev­ery month. Last year, the non-profit res­cued 336,000kg of bread worth more than $3.5 mil­lion, and fed 21,600 “happy stom-</p>
    <p>achs” in the process, said Ms Sim.</p>
    <p>Bread is in­ex­pen­sive, so most peo­ple hardly give a sec­ond thought to throw­ing it out. But bin­ning huge amounts of bread is prob­lem­atic not only be­cause it adds more trash to Sin­ga­pore’s fast-fill­ing Se­makau land­fill, but also be­cause the en­ergy and re­sources put into pro­duc­ing it go to waste.</p>
    <p>Pro­duc­ing a loaf of bread in­volves a long-drawn process of grow­ing and har­vest­ing wheat, trans­port­ing the grains to the mill, grind­ing them into flour, and fi­nally bak­ing and pack­ag­ing it. Yet, bread con­tin­ues to be one of the most un­der­val­ued items in peo­ple’s eyes.</p>
    <p>An NEA study in 2017 found that each week, about 2.5kg of food waste is thrown away by an av­er­age Sin­ga­pore home. Bread, along­side rice and noo­dles, made up the most com­monly wasted food items.</p>
    <p>While FFTH’s Bread Run pro­gramme has done a huge part in pre­vent­ing wastage, a hand­ful of bak­eries told the char­ity they are re­luc­tant to do­nate un­sold bread be­cause of li­a­bil­ity is­sues.</p>
    <p>“(There’s al­ways) the fear that some­one eats the food and gets food poi­son­ing,” Ms Sim said.</p>
    <p>Mr Louis Ng, an MP for Nee Soon GRC and chair­man of the Gov­ern­ment Par­lia­men­tary Com­mit­tee for Sus­tain­abil­ity and the En­vi­ron­ment, is work­ing to re­move this bar­rier for busi­nesses here that wish to give away un­sold food prod­ucts. The Good Sa­mar­i­tan Food Do­na­tion Act that he plans to ta­ble would pro­vide le­gal pro­tec­tion for these busi­nesses against such li­a­bil­ity.</p>
    <p>“There are huge amounts of food wasted, and then there are peo­ple who are go­ing hun­gry. If Sin­ga­pore­ans see that there is an av­enue where they can do­nate to the less for­tu­nate, I think that matches the two causes quite well,” he said.</p>
    <p>“That’s why we wanted to do this piece of leg­is­la­tion – to re­ally shine the spot­light on this is­sue, on food wastage, on the hun­gry.”</p>
    <p>About 1.3 bil­lion tonnes of food is wasted glob­ally each year, even as 800 mil­lion peo­ple in the world go to bed hun­gry ev­ery night.</p>
    <p>Hav­ing good Sa­mar­i­tan laws in place would ease anx­i­eties for busi­nesses, said Ms Sim. But the chal­lenge would be en­sur­ing food safety stan­dards for dif­fer­ent types of food do­nated, she added.</p>
