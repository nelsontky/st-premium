    <p>•</p>
    <p>GENEVA Rates of Covid-19 in­fec­tion and hos­pi­tal bed oc­cu­pancy are ris­ing in Europe, where the au­thor­i­ties need to work to halt the spread ahead of the in­fluenza sea­son, a top World Health Or­gan­i­sa­tion (WHO) of­fi­cial has said.</p>
    <p>“Europe has a lot of work to do to sta­bilise the sit­u­a­tion and bring trans­mis­sion un­der con­trol,” WHO’s emer­gency expert Mike Ryan told a press con­fer­ence on Friday.</p>
    <p>“Over­all, within that very large re­gion, we are see­ing a wor­ry­ing in­crease in dis­ease.”</p>
    <p>Dr Maria Van Kerkhove, the WHO’s tech­ni­cal lead on Covid-19, said: “We are at the end of Septem­ber and we haven’t even started our flu sea­son yet, so what we are wor­ried about is the pos­si­bil­ity that th­ese trends are go­ing in the wrong di­rec­tion.”</p>
    <p>Ear­lier ad­mis­sions to hos­pi­tals and the use of the steroid dex­am­etha­sone were sav­ing lives, she said, adding: “We want to avoid any na­tional lock­downs that were hap­pen­ing in the be­gin­ning.”</p>
    <p>Pres­sure is mount­ing on Euro­pean lead­ers to con­tain the resur­gent coro­n­avirus pan­demic as coun­tries such as Spain re-emerge as hot spots.</p>
    <p>In Spain, ten­sions erupted into a pub­lic spat, with Prime Min­is­ter Pe­dro Sanchez’s gov­ern­ment urg­ing lo­cal Madrid of­fi­cials to lock down the en­tire city.</p>
    <p>The pro­posal was promptly re­buffed by the cap­i­tal re­gion’s ad­min­is­tra­tion, which is con­trolled by the big­gest op­po­si­tion party to Mr Sanchez’s coali­tion.</p>
    <p>Europe’s big­gest economies are ex­pe­ri­enc­ing a dis­qui­et­ing spike in in­fec­tions, adding to risks weigh­ing on a slow­ing re­cov­ery.</p>
    <p>Of­fi­cials in Italy and France are fac­ing new ques­tions about in­ten­sive care ca­pac­ity, and Bri­tain’s daily cases re­main at the high­est level yet. Italy re­ported over 1,900 new in­fec­tions on Friday, the most since May 1.</p>
    <p>The au­thor­i­ties across the re­gion are fight­ing back with a se­ries of piece­meal mea­sures dubbed “lock­down lite”.</p>
    <p>But even those lim­ited curbs are spurring un­rest. Madrid has seen street protests in work­ing-class ar­eas sub­ject to new curbs, with lo­cals claim­ing of­fi­cials are favour­ing wealth­ier neigh­bour­hoods.</p>
    <p>In Marseille, French Health Min­is­ter Olivier Veran sought to con­front de­trac­tors of the Paris gov­ern­ment’s move to close the city’s bars and restau­rants for at least two weeks, say­ing it is a way to avert even stricter mea­sures.</p>
    <p>Mr Veran also cited the risk of a break­down in in­ten­sive-care unit care at a time of “max­i­mum alert” for the Marseille area. That means tak­ing “the nec­es­sary mea­sures, even if they are un­pop­u­lar”, he said on Twit­ter.</p>
