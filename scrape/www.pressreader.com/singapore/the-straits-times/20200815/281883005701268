    <p>KOTA KINABALU • A sub-com­man­der of the Abu Sayyaf mil­i­tant group known as Idang Susukan has been ar­rested by Philip­pine po­lice in Davao City.</p>
    <p>He was ap­pre­hended on Thurs­day at the house of Nur Misuari, leader of the Moro National Lib­er­a­tion Front, and is cur­rently de­tained at the of­fices of the Davao City po­lice.</p>
    <p>The Star had ear­lier re­ported that the no­to­ri­ous gun­man, whose real name is Ab­dulji­had Susukan, was mov­ing about freely in Davao city.</p>
    <p>Idang had 34 war­rants of ar­rest against him and was wanted by the Philip­pines and Malaysia for killings and kid­nap­pings in the south­ern Philip­pines and the east coast of Sabah, Malaysia.</p>
    <p>Re­gional in­tel­li­gence sources said he ar­rived in Davao on Tues­day with Misuari and was seen walk­ing freely in the city. The sources said Idang had sur­ren­dered to Misuari on Jolo is­land in April.</p>
    <p>Idang had been in­volved in a spate of cross-bor­der kid­nap­pings for ran­som in Sabah’s east coast since 2013. These in­clude the ab­duc­tions in 2014 of Chi­nese national Gao Huayun and Filip­ina Marcy Darawan in April, Chi­nese national Yang Zai Lin in May, and Malaysian Chan Sai Chun in June that year.</p>
    <p>Idang was also con­nected to the be­head­ing of Malaysian tourist Bernard Then on Jolo is­land in Novem­ber 2015.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to re­gional in­tel­li­gence sources, Misuari brought Idang to Davao to have him fit­ted with a pros­thetic limb, after he lost his left arm dur­ing a gun bat­tle with the Philip­pine armed forces on Jolo is­land early last year.</p>
    <p>Sources also said that Misuari is ex­pected to meet Philip­pine Pres­i­dent Ro­drigo Duterte in the next few days.</p>
    <p>Misuari has pledged to Mr Duterte to bring peace to the south­ern Mus­lim Min­danao re­gion and crush mil­i­tant groups in the south­ern Philip­pines.</p>
    <p>Misuari faces charges of re­bel­lion and cor­rup­tion but was given “tem­po­rary lib­erty” in Oc­to­ber 2016 to al­low him to par­tic­i­pate in peace talks with the Duterte gov­ern­ment.</p>
