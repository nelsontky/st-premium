    <p>The case of the Na­tional Univer­sity of Sin­ga­pore stu­dent who at­tacked his former girl­friend has raised ques­tions over how the judg­ment was made, as well as drawn crit­i­cism over what many con­sider to be a dis­pro­por­tion­ate sen­tence. Le­gal ex­perts weigh in on penal­ties given to him.</p>
    <p>He tres­passed into his former girl­friend’s home in a des­per­ate bid to per­suade her to get back to­gether, but events quickly erupted into an out­burst of vi­o­lence that has sent shockwaves across the coun­try.</p>
    <p>When univer­sity stu­dent Yin Zi Qin re­alised the 21-year-old woman did not want to re­sume their re­la­tion­ship, he slammed his head against the wall and later at­tacked her.</p>
    <p>He choked her and, in the strug­gle, she suf­fered scrapes to her neck and a bloody left eye.</p>
    <p>The woman blacked out. When she came to, she told Yin, 23, to leave and he climbed out of her bed­room win­dow. By this time, her fam­ily was alerted to the com­mo­tion.</p>
    <p>Yin then turned back and tried to apol­o­gise by get­ting down on his knees. He was also at­tacked by the woman’s step­fa­ther, who burned his face with a cig­a­rette butt.</p>
    <p>The as­sault in­sti­gated by Yin, a Na­tional Univer­sity of Sin­ga­pore (NUS) un­der­grad­u­ate, be­came a talk­ing point last week af­ter it was re­ported that he was given a 12-day short de­ten­tion or­der (SDO), a day re­port­ing or­der of five months, and an or­der to do 80 hours of com­mu­nity ser­vice.</p>
    <p>The At­tor­ney-Gen­eral’s Cham­bers has said it will not ap­peal against the ver­dict and Yin is serv­ing the de­ten­tion or­der in prison, but the in­ci­dent drew ire over the is­sue of vi­o­lence against women and called into ques­tion the penal­ties laid out in the law.</p>
    <p>Yin, a sec­ond-year den­tistry stu­dent, has been sus­pended from NUS and faces dis­ci­plinary pro­ceed­ings.</p>
    <p>The case has sparked on­line pe­ti­tions, as well as calls by women’s rights groups, ques­tion­ing the lev­ity of the sen­tence meted out for an of­fence of such a na­ture.</p>
    <p>The mat­ter cul­mi­nated last Tues­day with Law and Home Af­fairs Min­is­ter K. Shan­mugam say­ing that the Govern­ment will re­view three ar­eas: the frame­work of penal­ties for vi­o­lence cases; the ex­tent to which one’s back­ground, among other fac­tors, should be rel­e­vant in penal­ties; and the rel­a­tive penal­ties for var­i­ous of­fences.</p>
    <p>Was the sen­tence fair?</p>
    <p>Public dis­quiet over Yin’s case has raised ques­tions over how the judg­ment was made, as well as crit­i­cism over what many con­sid­ered a dis­pro­por­tion­ate sen­tence.</p>
    <p>But le­gal ex­perts The Straits Times spoke to said that the public is of­ten not privy to the many fac­tors be­ing weighed when a judge de­cides on a sen­tence, and most agreed un­equiv­o­cally that the sen­tence was fair and pro­por­tion­ate.</p>
    <p>Crim­i­nal lawyer Amo­lat Singh noted: “We hear a lot from the court of public opin­ion, but this is the court of law... Sen­tenc­ing is a mix­ture of sci­ence and art.”</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore Man­age­ment Univer­sity as­sis­tant law pro­fes­sor Ben­jamin Joshua Ong said one of the things courts have to do is es­tab­lish the main aims of the penalty.</p>
    <p>Prof Ong re­ferred to Yin’s case, not­ing: “Re­ha­bil­i­ta­tion seems to be at the fore­front here. While the SDO is a com­mu­nity-based sen­tence as­so­ci­ated with re­hab, it also has an el­e­ment of de­ter­rence, as be­ing locked up is still an un­pleas­ant thing.”</p>
    <p>There are mit­i­gat­ing fac­tors, said crim­i­nal lawyer Su­nil Sud­heesan, point­ing out that there was more than what was ini­tially re­ported in the me­dia and that Yin had re­turned to seek for­give­ness from his former girl­friend and her par­ents.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to de­tails that went largely un­re­ported ini­tially, Yin was beaten by the woman’s step­fa­ther. He also asked her par­ents to call for an am­bu­lance for the in­jured woman.</p>
    <p>ST un­der­stands that the woman’s step­fa­ther was given a warn­ing by the po­lice.</p>
    <p>Apart from some scars on her neck, the woman did not suf­fer any per­ma­nent in­jury.</p>
    <p>While the apol­ogy does not ab­solve Yin of his ac­tions, es­pe­cially the psy­cho­log­i­cal and emo­tional toll on the woman and her fam­ily, his re­morse is worth some­thing, said Mr Sud­heesan, who is also pres­i­dent of the As­so­ci­a­tion of Crim­i­nal Lawyers of Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>“It’s not a sen­tence where he gets away scot-free. An SDO might not be on his record un­less he re­of­fends, but nei­ther is it a hon­ey­moon,” he said.</p>
    <p>How­ever, he and other le­gal ex­perts noted that the is­sue of vi­o­lence against women or the vul­ner­a­ble can­not be taken lightly, and is un­der­stand­ably one of the main rea­sons the case has stirred strong emotions among the com­mu­nity.</p>
    <p>Women’s rights group As­so­ci­a­tion of Women for Ac­tion and Re­search (Aware) and the Peo­ple’s Ac­tion Party Women’s Wing ex­pressed sur­prise and dis­ap­point­ment at the sen­tence.</p>
    <p>Aware had ear­lier said that such a sen­tence had a “detri­men­tal im­pact” on public per­cep­tions of vi­o­lence against women and it in­di­cated to per­pe­tra­tors that they can get away with a light pun­ish­ment. Con­versely, vic­tims might feel that the of­ten ar­du­ous process of re­port­ing their ex­pe­ri­ence could be fu­tile.</p>
    <p>Aware ex­ec­u­tive direc­tor Corinna Lim said the fact that Yin him­self had been at the re­ceiv­ing end of a beat­ing did not mit­i­gate the harm that he had ini­tially caused.</p>
    <p>She said that while the step­fa­ther’s ac­tions are not con­doned, they do not change Yin’s “un­pro­voked and de­struc­tive” act of vi­o­lence.</p>
    <p>Ms Lim added: “Re­gard­less of his po­ten­tial or later re­morse, Yin should be held ap­pro­pri­ately ac­count­able for his ac­tions.”</p>
    <p>Do univer­sity stu­dents get off lightly?</p>
    <p>Prof Ong said it is the con­text of the case that drew public ire, adding that the re­la­tion­ship of the cou­ple put the woman in a more vul­ner­a­ble po­si­tion.</p>
    <p>But changes to the law in Jan­uary have al­lowed for harsher pun­ish­ments to be meted out for crimes against the vul­ner­a­ble and those in in­ti­mate re­la­tion­ships.</p>
    <p>Yin at­tacked his former girl­friend in May last year.</p>
    <p>“If the new laws had come into ef­fect be­fore the in­ci­dent, it could be that the sen­tence could have been more se­vere,” noted Prof Ong.</p>
    <p>As­so­ciate Pro­fes­sor Fer­lin Jay­atissa from the Sin­ga­pore Univer­sity of So­cial Sciences’ School of Law also pointed out that Yin’s case is the lat­est in a se­ries in­volv­ing male univer­sity stu­dents that have come under public scru­tiny.</p>
    <p>The re­cent case of NUS un­der­grad­u­ate Ter­ence Siow, 24, who mo­lested a woman in an MRT sta­tion, sparked a sim­i­lar public out­cry.</p>
    <p>Siow had ini­tially been sen­tenced to 21 months of su­per­vised pro­ba­tion and 150 hours of com­mu­nity ser­vice.</p>
    <p>A dis­trict judge had noted Siow’s good aca­demic re­sults, which high­lighted his “po­ten­tial to ex­cel in life” and that he had an “ex­tremely strong propen­sity for re­form”.</p>
    <p>The pros­e­cu­tion ap­pealed against the sen­tence and Siow was jailed for two weeks.</p>
    <p>“Mem­bers of the com­mu­nity strongly feel (th­ese of­fend­ers) have been let off too le­niently by the courts and their uni­ver­si­ties, al­legedly be­cause of the un­due weight placed on their per­ceived higher ed­u­ca­tional sta­tus,” said Prof Jay­atissa, adding that this per­cep­tion is mis­placed.</p>
    <p>He said aca­demic qual­i­fi­ca­tions are just one of the points taken into ac­count for sen­tenc­ing and ac­cess­ing one’s po­ten­tial for re­ha­bil­i­ta­tion and rein­te­gra­tion into so­ci­ety.</p>
    <p>“The ex­er­cise of sen­tenc­ing justly com­pels a court to con­sider of­fence-cen­tric and of­fender-cen­tric fac­tors, while bal­anc­ing the re­tribu­tive, de­ter­rent and re­ha­bil­i­ta­tive pur­poses of pun­ish­ment,” he said.</p>
    <p>The of­fence Yin was con­victed of car­ries a penalty of up to three years’ jail and a $5,000 fine.</p>
    <p>The pros­e­cu­tion had asked for a 14-day SDO cou­pled with com­mu­nity ser­vice and day re­port­ing or­ders, fol­low­ing a sen­tenc­ing frame­work set out by a pre­vi­ous High Court case.</p>
    <p>“This would serve to ad­e­quately pun­ish and de­ter the ac­cused, whilst at the same time, pay heed to the re­ha­bil­i­ta­tive needs of the ac­cused,” said the pros­e­cu­tion.</p>
    <p>Dis­trict Judge Marvin Bay said in his oral re­marks that while pro­ba­tion was not suitable in Yin’s case, his “rel­a­tive youth, his re­ha­bil­i­ta­tive prospects and his lack of an­tecedents” make com­mu­ni­ty­based sen­tences a vi­able op­tion.</p>
    <p>Of­ten, the ed­u­ca­tional sta­tus of an of­fender stands out, es­pe­cially if the me­dia ze­roes in on those who are more “aca­dem­i­cally promis­ing”, said le­gal pro­fes­sion­als.</p>
    <p>The judg­ment made by Chief Jus­tice Sun­daresh Menon, who heard the High Court ap­peal for Siow, stated that a judge must ex­am­ine the of­fence and the rel­e­vant char­ac­ter­is­tics and back­ground of the of­fender.</p>
    <p>CJ Menon wrote: “But in con­sid­er­ing those char­ac­ter­is­tics and that back­ground, the court is never con­cerned with the of­fender’s so­cial sta­tus, wealth or other in­di­cia of priv­i­lege and po­si­tion in so­ci­ety.”</p>
    <p>Prof Ong cited CJ Menon’s judg­ment and said the courts make it clear that aca­demic qual­i­fi­ca­tions are merely one in­di­ca­tor of re­ha­bil­i­ta­tive ca­pac­ity. “It would be the same for some­one work­ing to­wards a di­ploma or any goal in gen­eral. That is when ed­u­ca­tional propen­sity comes in,” he added.</p>
    <p>Ed­u­ca­tional propen­sity can be eclipsed by other fac­tors, such as the of­fence it­self or the po­ten­tial for re­of­fend­ing, said le­gal ex­perts.</p>
    <p>Mr Singh added: “Un­for­tu­nately, in the court of public opin­ion, this case had all the dra­matic el­e­ments in place that fanned the flames. This re­sulted in peo­ple call­ing for ‘street jus­tice’, so to speak.”</p>
    <p>Why the re­view?</p>
    <p>The public re­ac­tion to Yin’s case has prompted the au­thor­i­ties to re­view the penalty frame­work for vi­o­lence cases.</p>
    <p>Mr Shan­mugam said the courts are “not the is­sue” here, as judges de­cide based on what is pre­sented to them: “When we dis­agree, the ap­proach should be to look at the le­gal pol­icy frame­work, which the Govern­ment can change, and which is what we will do.”</p>
    <p>The re­view was wel­comed by le­gal ex­perts, who said that while the au­thor­i­ties should not pan­der to public pres­sure, it is im­por­tant to take note of sen­ti­ment.</p>
    <p>Prof Jay­atissa noted: “It is the pre­rog­a­tive of the Min­is­ter of Law and Home Af­fairs to con­sider public sen­ti­ment on ef­fec­tive­ness of the crime jus­tice sys­tem. Yin’s case has resur­faced is­sues about the ad­e­quacy of penal­ties for vi­o­lence against women and chil­dren and do­mes­tic vi­o­lence.”</p>
    <p>Prof Ong added that a re­view could be use­ful to ad­dress the rel­a­tive penal­ties for dif­fer­ent of­fences. He gave the ex­am­ple of van­dal­ism, which car­ries the pos­si­ble pun­ish­ment of can­ing, ver­sus the crime of vol­un­tar­ily caus­ing hurt which does not.</p>
    <p>“There could be a sense of in­con­sis­tency, es­pe­cially when the public com­pares the crimes and pun­ish­ments,” he said.</p>
    <p>Aware’s Ms Lim also wel­comed the re­view, and sug­gested that it look at the whole crim­i­nal jus­tice sys­tem and the ways it might let down sur­vivors of vi­o­lence.</p>
    <p>“In fact, we are con­cerned that penal­ties will be made un­duly harsh in a bid to pla­cate public anger,” she said, adding that stud­ies have shown harsh penal­ties are not nec­es­sar­ily strong de­ter­rents of vi­o­lence.</p>
    <p>In par­tic­u­lar, Aware wants to make sure there are spe­cialised au­thor­i­ties that can han­dle cases re­lat­ing to vi­o­lence, which re­quire par­tic­u­lar ex­per­tise, such as un­der­stand­ing the im­pact of trauma and knowl­edge of how gen­der bias works against fe­male vic­tims.</p>
    <p>Ms Lim added: “And be­yond ques­tions about the law, we need to ask our­selves why a young man’s in­stinct was to turn to quite hor­rific acts of vi­o­lence when he did not get what he wanted.</p>
    <p>“What in our cul­ture is im­plic­itly pro­mot­ing that be­hav­iour?”</p>
