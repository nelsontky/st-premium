    <p>While Covid-19 has made it nec­es­sary for many to em­brace dig­i­tal­i­sa­tion, there are some who need help learn­ing tools and skills of tech­nol­ogy, and they should not be left be­hind, said Min­is­ter in the Prime Min­is­ter’s Of­fice Ma­liki Os­man.</p>
    <p>Dig­i­tal in­clu­siv­ity was one of the main con­cerns high­lighted by par­tic­i­pants dur­ing a vir­tual di­a­logue Dr Ma­liki and Se­nior Min­is­ter of State for Man­power and De­fence Zaqy Mo­hamad had with mem­bers of the Malay/Mus­lim com­mu­nity yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The di­a­logue, Seiz­ing Op­por­tu­ni­ties in the Age of Dig­i­tal Trans­for­ma­tion, was the first of two to take place un­der the Cip­tasama@M3 pro­gramme, which aims to gather in­sights to be used in pol­icy de­ci­sions.</p>
    <p>Dr Ma­liki noted that par­tic­i­pants had high­lighted how groups such as the el­derly and res­i­dents of rental flats were es­pe­cially in dan­ger of be­ing ex­cluded tech­no­log­i­cally, and said he was heart­ened to hear that par­tic­i­pants were con­cerned about this.</p>
    <p>“They re­minded us that we must make sure that what­ever we do, we must get to th­ese vul­ner­a­ble groups and… en­sure that we walk the j our­ney with them so they don’t get left be­hind,” he said.</p>
    <p>The com­mu­nity has a role to play in this as well. Dr Ma­liki urged mem­bers of the com­mu­nity to reach out to those in dan­ger of fall­ing be­hind dig­i­tally and guid­ing them.</p>
    <p>In­tro­duced last year, Cip­tasama@M3, or Co-cre­ation@M3, is a Malay/Mus­lim-fo­cused pro­gramme that aims to en­cour­age the com­mu­nity’s par­tic­i­pa­tion in pol­i­cy­mak­ing.</p>
    <p>It is an ini­tia­tive un­der the M3 col­lab­o­ra­tion by three key Malay/Mus­lim or­gan­i­sa­tions: Men­daki, the Is­lamic Re­li­gious Coun­cil of Sin­ga­pore and the Peo­ple’s As­so­ci­a­tion Malay Ac­tiv­ity Ex­ec­u­tive Com­mit­tees Coun­cil.</p>
    <p>The roughly two-hour di­a­logue in­volved over 60 par­tic­i­pants, who were di­vided into small groups to dis­cuss is­sues on dig­i­tal trans­for­ma­tion and their ex­pe­ri­ences adapt­ing dur­ing the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Some par­tic­i­pants high­lighted chal­lenges in get­ting mem­bers of the com­mu­nity to em­brace learn­ing more ad­vanced skills and dig­i­tal­i­sa­tion.</p>
    <p>One par­tic­i­pant said there was a need to high­light the ben­e­fits of pick­ing up new skills. She added that more en­gag­ing forms of me­dia could be used to do so, such as pop­u­lar so­cial me­dia plat­forms like In­sta­gram.</p>
    <p>Mr Zaqy ac­knowl­edged that there could be some is­sues over how the Gov­ern­ment com­mu­ni­cates its mes­sag­ing, and that this will be looked at.</p>
    <p>He also noted that many in the di­a­logue spoke about re­silience in the com­mu­nity in the face of Covid-19 and tech­no­log­i­cal dis­rup­tions, and held up how Malay/Mus­lims here have learnt to adapt.</p>
    <p>“I think it’s quite won­der­ful to see many who are quite pos­i­tive about the sit­u­a­tion. Pos­i­tive in the sense that while times are bleak and hard, many, too, saw prospects or op­por­tu­ni­ties, de­spite the sit­u­a­tion,” he said.</p>
    <p>The sec­ond di­a­logue will fo­cus on strength­en­ing Malay/Mus­lim fam­i­lies. It will be chaired by Min­is­ter of State for Home Af­fairs and Na­tional De­vel­op­ment Muham­mad Faishal Ibrahim and Par­lia­men­tary Sec­re­tary for Health Ra­hayu Mahzam next Tues­day.</p>
    <p>The di­a­logues are be­ing held in con­junc­tion with the Sin­ga­pore To­gether Emerg­ing Stronger Con­ver­sa­tions, in which Sin­ga­pore­ans share their hopes and plans for a more car­ing, co­he­sive, and re­silient post-coron­avirus so­ci­ety by co-cre­at­ing pol­icy so­lu­tions.</p>
