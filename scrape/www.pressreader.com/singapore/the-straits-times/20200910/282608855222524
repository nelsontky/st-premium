    <p>High School Mu­si­cal (2006) was not just one of the most suc­cess­ful Dis­ney Chan­nel orig­i­nal movies, it was also a cul­tural phe­nom­e­non.</p>
    <p>The teen mu­si­cal com­edy birthed a huge, lu­cra­tive fran­chise – two se­quels, sev­eral spin-offs and re­makes, sold-out stage shows and a con­cert tour for its chart-top­ping sound­track.</p>
    <p>And it launched the ca­reers of stars Zac Efron and Vanessa Hud­gens, whose char­ac­ters were a nod to Romeo and Juliet.</p>
    <p>So ex­pec­ta­tions are high for the new­est project from Em­my­win­ning di­rec­tor Kenny Ortega: the teen mu­si­cal se­ries Julie And The Phan­toms, which pre­mieres on Net­flix to­day.</p>
    <p>To carry the show and sing its ra­dio-ready tunes, chore­og­ra­pher and pro­ducer Ortega – who chore­ographed the films Dirty Danc­ing (1987) and Fer­ris Bueller’s Day Off (1986) – cast an un­known with no pro­fes­sional ex­pe­ri­ence singing or act­ing.</p>
    <p>Madi­son Reyes plays Julie, a girl who loses her love of mu­sic when her mother dies, then rekin­dles it when she meets the ghosts of three young mu­si­cians and forms a band with them.</p>
    <p>The 16-year-old chat­ted to The Straits Times re­cently from her home in Penn­syl­va­nia, in the United States, about how she landed the plum part, which Ortega wanted to be played by a His­panic ac­tress.</p>
    <p>Cast­ing direc­tors sieved through 700 au­di­tions from around the world, look­ing for a girl who could sing, act and dance, but still felt re­lat­able.</p>
    <p>Reyes chuck­les when she looks back on the au­di­tion process be­cause of how green she was. Yet she sailed through de­spite be­ing new to it all, un­like most of those vy­ing for the role.</p>
    <p>“I was 14 and the youngest girl there. And some of them had gone through a lot of call­backs (for the au­di­tion),” she says.</p>
    <p>“For me, there was just one af­ter I sent them my au­di­tion clip, which I</p>
    <p>didn’t even know how to do prop­erly. Af­ter a few days, I got a call say­ing, ‘Hey, we’d love for you to come out to Los An­ge­les for a call­back.’”</p>
    <p>She re­mem­bers be­ing in the room with the other girls. “They were ask­ing if I came out to au­di­tion for pi­lot sea­son. And I was, like, ‘What is that?’ I was just so in­ex­pe­ri­enced.”</p>
    <p>Reyes also had to act and sing with dif­fer­ent com­bi­na­tions of ac­tors au­di­tion­ing for the ghosts’ roles to see if she had chem­istry with them.</p>
    <p>And, de­spite look­ing and sound­ing like she had spent years per­form­ing, she has had no for­mal train­ing.</p>
    <p>“The only pro­fes­sional help I had was when I started this process,” she says. “Our vo­cal coach had so much pa­tience and was such a great teacher, and my vo­cal range is so much higher than it was be­fore. Some­times, I can’t be­lieve I am ac­tu­ally hit­ting those notes.</p>
    <p>“And I had a lot of help with play­ing the pi­ano be­cause I was self-taught,” she adds.</p>
    <p>But Reyes feels she ul­ti­mately got the job by be­ing her­self. “There are only so many things you can learn in school. With this role, it was based more on raw­ness.</p>
    <p>“I didn’t have any skills, so I guess it was j ust me be­ing my­self. Be­cause that’s all I re­ally had go­ing for me when I went to the au­di­tion.”</p>
    <p>Once she landed the part, the ac­tress turned to Ortega for sup­port when­ever she was un­sure about a scene.</p>
    <p>The two also ex­ten­sively dis­cussed the im­por­tance of the char­ac­ter’s eth­nic back­ground and how that in­forms the story.</p>
    <p>Says Reyes, who is of Puerto Ri­can de­scent: “The thing we talked about the most was Julie’s cul­ture. I’m 100 per cent Latino Amer­i­can and when I was grow­ing up, I al­ways wanted to see that cor­rect rep­re­sen­ta­tion.”</p>
    <p>As the show pro­gresses, the char­ac­ter’s “love for her­self grows and so does her love for her cul­ture”.</p>
    <p>In the sec­ond sea­son, which has just been an­nounced, Reyes hopes Julie, like some of her fam­ily mem­bers, will have a few lines of Span­ish di­a­logue.</p>
    <p>For now, she says, it is enough that the show ac­knowl­edges the char­ac­ters’ cul­ture with ev­ery­thing from the food they eat to the art­work in their home and Julie’s jewellery.</p>
    <p>“It’s those lit­tle de­tails that can mean so much to some­body,” she says. “And they mean so much to me as well.”</p>
