    <p>Har­rods in Lon­don has added a new fine jewellery la­bel to its cov­eted ros­ter of brands, and it is one Sin­ga­pore­ans can be proud of.</p>
    <p>Si­mone Jewels, founded by lo­cal jew­eller Si­mone Ng, de­buted at the lux­ury depart­ment store’s Fine Jewellery Room on Oct 15, the first Sin­ga­porean jewellery brand to do so.</p>
    <p>It was a sur­prise and “a dream come true”, says the 46-year-old. The store has a no­to­ri­ously se­lec­tive process and as it does not take ap­point­ments, “you can’t go knock­ing on Har­rods’ door”, she adds.</p>
    <p>“Har­rods was look­ing for fresh, promis­ing de­sign­ers and I guess we fit the bill,” says the jew­eller, who had to over­see the mov­ing-in process over Zoom last week.</p>
    <p>She cred­its En­ter­prise Sin­ga­pore’s Lon­don of­fice for link­ing her up with the House of Lux­ury, a global agency that rep­re­sents fine art and jewellery brands. It showed the Si­mone Jewels port­fo­lio to Har­rods and set up a vir­tual meet­ing, and the rest is his­tory.</p>
    <p>The cer­ti­fied gemol­o­gist was told that “there were a few things about the brand that Har­rods liked” – how all her pieces are one-of-akind and come with a story, and that she brings knowl­edge and va­ri­ety in rare gem­stones to dis­cern­ing col­lec­tors. Her la­bel is known for whim­si­cal, coloured gem-cen­tric de­signs in­spired by his­tor­i­cal fig­ures and events.</p>
    <p>The show­case is a pop-up fea­tur­ing her Quintessen­tially Bri­tish col­lec­tion – an as­sort­ment of “quaintly English” rings, ear­rings and neck­laces in­spired by the Ge­or­gian era of Bri­tish his­tory in the 18th and early 19th cen­turies. The pieces in­clude a £38,000 (S$67,700) Ge­or­gian Gran­deur neck­lace. The col­lec­tion will also be avail­able on­line for three months at har­rods.com.</p>
    <p>To her knowl­edge, new brands rarely en­ter Har­rods on a per­ma­nent ba­sis the first time.</p>
    <p>“This was an op­por­tu­nity to get our foot in the door,” she says.</p>
    <p>“I re­mem­ber many years ago, step­ping into Har­rods for the first time, I won­dered if there were any Sin­ga­porean brands here. I said to my­self, it would be so nice if we could be here one day.”</p>
    <p>The Malaysia-born de­signer from Kuala Lumpur, whose grand­fa­ther owned a jewellery re­tail chain, moved to Sin­ga­pore in 2002. She started her brand in 2006, after pick­ing up jewellery de­sign as a hobby and re­al­is­ing she had a flair for it.</p>
    <p>The pan­demic has been more man­age­able than ex­pected, says Ms Ng. Though she had to deal with can­celled global jewellery shows such as Cou­ture Las Ve­gas and Paris Fash­ion Week, the team was pushed to adapt cre­atively, such as by of­fer­ing gem­stone mas­ter­classes on­line.</p>
    <p>She adds that the brand was in­vited by lux­ury fash­ion e-tailer Moda Operandi to do a solo trunk show vir­tu­ally early next year, with its “top fine jewellery cus­tomers” in at­ten­dance.</p>
    <p>Un­likely celebri­ties have also been pho­tographed sport­ing Si­mone Jewels in this time, such as Raya Abirached, a Le­banese tele­vi­sion pre­sen­ter who co-hosts tal­ent show Arabs Got Tal­ent; and Bri­tish rap­per Ms Banks.</p>
    <p>Scor­ing Har­rods is a mile­stone for the brand, says Ms Ng.</p>
    <p>“Go­ing in­ter­na­tional in any year is al­ready very dif­fi­cult; this year added a whole new di­men­sion to the chal­lenges. I feel that it’s re­ally a coup for a Sin­ga­porean jewellery brand to be show­cased in Har­rods. It’s a promis­ing start to our in­ter­na­tional jour­ney.”</p>
    <p>Other Sin­ga­porean brands in Har­rods in­clude de­signer Ethan Koh’s lux­ury ac­ces­sories la­bel Ethan K – known for its bags made of ex­otic an­i­mal skins – which opened a bou­tique on the ground floor in 2014.</p>
