    <p>Mr Goh Hengyi loved small an­i­mals, es­pe­cially dogs. Af­ter his re­peated re­quests, his mother re­lented, promis­ing him that they would get one when he com­pleted his master’s de­gree in eco­nomics at the Univer­sity of Western Aus­tralia (UWA).</p>
    <p>He never made it back.</p>
    <p>On June 29 last year, on the last day of a road trip with friends, the 23-year-old was swept away by waves at a “nat­u­ral spa” rock for­ma­tion at In­jidup Beach on the coast of Western Aus­tralia, about 260km south of Perth.</p>
    <p>Be­cause of Covid-19 re­stric­tions then, his grief-stricken par­ents and el­der brother, Jeremy, 30, ar­rived in Perth only a week af­ter the in­ci­dent and spent 14 days in quar­an­tine be­fore they could pro­ceed with the fu­neral. The univer­sity ar­ranged a memo­rial ser­vice for the fam­ily, which was also livestream­ed to al­most 300 rel­a­tives and friends here.</p>
    <p>If not for the pan­demic, Mr Goh would have re­turned to Singapore dur­ing his term break, but it made no sense to be quar­an­tined for two weeks in each coun­try, says his fa­ther, Mr Ken­neth Goh, 65, who shared his son’s life story with The Sun­day Times.</p>
    <p>His per­sonal ef­fects, dis­played in the fam­ily’s liv­ing room for vis­it­ing friends, form a col­lage of his many pas­sions and ac­com­plish­ments.</p>
    <p>Tro­phies and medals for chess, ta­ble tennis, swim­ming, foot­ball, Na­tional Ser­vice (NS) ac­tiv­i­ties and more vie for space on top of his old pi­ano. The mul­ti­tal­ented sports­man played chess in in­ter­na­tional tour­na­ments i n pri­mary school, and rep­re­sented Dun­man High and Nanyang Ju­nior Col­lege in ta­ble tennis. Dur­ing his NS days, he vol­un­teered for the gru­elling Guards Con­ver­sion Course and at­tained the rank of corporal first class.</p>
    <p>His favourite blue Su­per­man logo T-shirt sits with a Chelsea Foot­ball Club jersey on top of an ad­ja­cent cab­i­net, along with toys and gifts from friends.</p>
    <p>A large box on the side holds notes from Mr Jeremy Goh, an ex­ec­u­tive in a ter­tiary in­sti­tu­tion, who has been writ­ing to his brother ev­ery day since the ac­ci­dent, in lieu of the What­sApp mes­sages the broth­ers used to ex­change reg­u­larly.</p>
    <p>He says he writes about his day and re­mem­bers his late brother, who would have turned 24 last Oc­to­ber, as some­one who brought “joy to people”.</p>
    <p>Their mother, Mrs Goh Ee Choo, 57, a re­tired in­for­ma­tion tech­nol­ogy pro­fes­sional like her hus­band, tears up as she re­calls her younger son’s bub­bly na­ture: “When­ever he went back to Aus­tralia, my helper would say, ‘Ma’am, the house is too quiet now.’</p>
    <p>“He doesn’t need to make noise. Some­how, he has the sun­shine to bring into the house.”</p>
    <p>GEN­ER­OUS FRIEND, LOV­ING SON</p>
    <p>His par­ents knew he was so­cia­ble. Mrs Goh re­mem­bers hav­ing to book his time for fam­ily din­ners when­ever he was back from his un­der­grad­u­ate stud­ies in Aus­tralia be­cause he was al­ways out with friends.</p>
    <p>But af­ter their loss, the Gohs dis­cov­ered facets to their son that warmed their hearts.</p>
    <p>Army bud­dies shared how he would take on an ex­tra load to help weaker pla­toon mates dur­ing ba­sic mil­i­tary train­ing. His friends showed his par­ents In­sta­gram posts in which he ex­pressed his ap­pre­ci­a­tion for his fam­ily, his fa­ther re­veals. In one par­tic­u­larly heart­felt post, he thanked them “for sup­port­ing me through­out my life and es­pe­cially dur­ing my tough­est time”, for feed­ing him and mak­ing sure he was healthy, and promised to re­pay them.</p>
    <p>“When we read this, we were very touched. There are things that he said to his friends, but he never said to us,” his fa­ther says, vis­i­bly moved as he reads the text out loud.</p>
    <p>Un­der­grad­u­ate Kit Ngoi, 24, a close friend of Mr Goh Hengyi since ju­nior col­lege days, de­scribes him as a “kind and gen­uine per­son who spread pos­i­tiv­ity” and “put in a lot of ef­fort to main­tain friend­ships”.</p>
    <p>His gen­er­ous na­ture re­vealed it­self in un­ex­pected ways. One of the duf­fle bags he had packed for his fate­ful trip con­tained cook­ing uten­sils as he had wanted to bake for his friends.</p>
    <p>“When I opened it, I got a shock, be­cause (there was) flour, sugar, a blen­der…” Mrs Goh re­counts, her voice break­ing at the mem­ory.</p>
    <p>“He cooked a lot to share with his friends,” his fa­ther says. “I didn’t know he could bake cakes.”</p>
    <p>While clear­ing out his be­long­ings in Perth, his par­ents also found that he had re­ceived awards for achiev­ing high dis­tinc­tions in all his sub­jects dur­ing his un­der­grad­u­ate stud­ies in eco­nomics and fi­nance.</p>
    <p>Not one to brag, he had not men­tioned th­ese ac­co­lades to them.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing con­ver­sa­tions with his son’s pals, Mr Ken­neth Goh learnt they had asked his son why he worked so hard, even set­ting aside his beloved De­fense Of The An­cients on­line game to re­vise.</p>
    <p>“He said (to his friends), ‘ My par­ents spent so much ef­fort and money to send me here for stud­ies. I can­not dis­ap­point them. I can­not fail them’,” he says with ob­vi­ous pride.</p>
    <p>“The mes­sage I want to send is, ‘It is a life well lived for him and a per­son well loved.’”</p>
    <p>LEAV­ING A LEGACY</p>
    <p>Pro­fes­sor Peter Robert­son, dean of UWA Busi­ness School, re­mem­bers Mr Goh Hengyi as “a tal­ented stu­dent who was ad­mired by his teach­ers for his abil­ity to give clear and con­cise an­swers to com­plex ques­tions, and for his gen­tle man­ner and po­lite­ness”.</p>
    <p>“He had an ex­cep­tional aca­demic record and had been ad­mit­ted to the Master of Eco­nomics pro­gramme, and was a widely re­spected mem­ber of the aca­demic com­mu­nity at UWA.”</p>
    <p>On Oct 15 last year, the univer­sity planted a pink flow­er­ing blood­wood tree at its Busi­ness School in mem­ory of its stu­dent’s “warm and gen­er­ous spirit”, says an UWA spokesman.</p>
    <p>To­gether with the Goh fam­ily, it has cre­ated a memo­rial fund for fu­ture in­ter­na­tional stu­dents in its Busi­ness School who are ex­pe­ri­enc­ing fi­nan­cial hard­ship, with the first dis­tri­bu­tion slated to be made dur­ing the first se­mes­ter in Fe­bru­ary next year.</p>
    <p>Mr Ken­neth Goh says the fam­ily wants to pay it for­ward, as they are grate­ful for UWA’s moral sup­port and as­sis­tance while they were in Perth. “This is also a way to re­mem­ber Hengyi in the univer­sity and to of­fer fi­nan­cial as­sis­tance to needy stu­dents dur­ing this dif­fi­cult pe­riod.”</p>
    <p>The Gohs, who still can­not hold a large-scale memo­rial ser­vice here be­cause of social distancing rules, de­cided in­stead to com­mem­o­rate his life in another way.</p>
    <p>On Dec 20, nine days be­fore his six-month death an­niver­sary, his fam­ily spon­sored five show dogs at the Singapore Zoo’s An­i­mal Friends Show “in or­der to ful­fil his wish and to keep our prom­ise”, his fa­ther says.</p>
    <p>The down­pour that af­ter­noon pe­tered out just in time for Mr Ken­neth Goh to give an emo­tional speech to ex­tended fam­ily mem­bers who had gath­ered at the am­phithe­atre for the oc­ca­sion.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing the heart­warm­ing cer­e­mony, zoo staff sur­prised the fam­ily with framed paw prints of the spon­sored dogs.</p>
    <p>Mr Goh and his wife put aside their fear of ca­nines to in­ter­act with the friendly quin­tet, their faces break­ing out in smiles af­ter months of tears.</p>
    <p>Mrs Goh says the spon­sor­ship is also more mean­ing­ful than adopt­ing a dog from a shel­ter, as the show dogs can per­form for chil­dren.</p>
    <p>“It makes people happy, which is what Hengyi liked to do.”</p>
