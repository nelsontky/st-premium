    <p>Mas­ter pot­ter and Cul­tural Medal­lion re­cip­i­ent who has a new ex­hi­bi­tion at Ion Art Gallery.</p>
    <p>“This year has been quite dras­tic for some peo­ple, but for me, it’s been the same thing – trav­el­ling to my work­shop at Te­masek Polytech­nic to do pot­tery, and teach­ing a few peo­ple. I’m an ed­u­ca­tor. It’s my duty to pass on as much as I can.</p>
    <p>The high­light of this year was when I heard that my grand­son had been ac­cepted into Vic­to­ria School. I was from Vic­to­ria, and my son was also from Vic­to­ria. Now, three of us are from the same school, keep­ing the tra­di­tion.</p>
    <p>Next year, I hope I can travel again. Pre­vi­ously, ev­ery few months, I would dis­ap­pear from Sin­ga­pore – all kinds of places, just to be away.”</p>
