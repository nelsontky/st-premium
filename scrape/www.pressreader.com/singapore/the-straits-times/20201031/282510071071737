    <p>HONG KONG • The big­gest ini­tial pub­lic of­fer­ing (IPO) of all time has un­leashed an in­vestor frenzy for the record books.</p>
    <p>In­di­vid­ual i nvestors i n Hong Kong and Shang­hai placed or­ders worth at least US$3 tril­lion (S$4.1 tril­lion) for shares in Mr Jack Ma’s Ant Group, enough money to buy JPMor­gan Chase 10 times over.</p>
    <p>Bid­ding was so in­tense in Hong Kong that one bro­ker­age’s plat­form briefly shut down af­ter be­com­ing over­whelmed by or­ders.</p>
    <p>De­mand for the re­tail por­tion in Shang­hai ex­ceeded ini­tial sup­ply by more than 870 times.</p>
    <p>The stam­pede is fu­elling pre­dic­tions of a first-day pop next Thurs­day, when Ant is due to start trad­ing, even as scep­tics warn of risks in­clud­ing the US elec­tion, tight­en­ing reg­u­la­tions in China and ris­ing Covid-19 cases world­wide.</p>
    <p>Whether Ant surges or not, the Chi­nese fin­tech be­he­moth’s US$35 bil­lion-plus IPO rep­re­sents a ma­jor vote of con­fi­dence in a com­pany that could end up shap­ing the fu­ture of global fi­nance. It also un­der­scores China Inc’s abil­ity to mar­shal huge amounts of cap­i­tal with­out tap­ping Amer­i­can mar­kets, a win for Bei­jing as it tries to re­duce its vul­ner­a­bil­ity to the threat of US fi­nan­cial sanc­tions.</p>
    <p>Soft­ware de­vel­oper Chen Wu, 35, was among those scram­bling for a piece of Ant’s of­fer­ing this week. His bro­ker­age al­lowed a small num­ber of clients to su­per­charge their bets us­ing 33 times lever­age, hand­ing out al­lo­ca­tions on a first-come, first-served ba­sis.</p>
    <p>“When it was re­leased at noon, I re­freshed my page again and again, clicked and clicked,” Mr Wu said on Tues­day, af­ter se­cur­ing a HK$5.7 mil­lion (S$1 mil­lion) block of Ant shares, equiv­a­lent to more than 80 per cent of his ex­ist­ing eq­uity port­fo­lio. “I got it around 12.01pm and the quota ran out within min­utes. I was lucky.”</p>
    <p>Ant is ben­e­fit­ing from the un­usu­ally buoy­ant mood among re­tail in­vestors glob­ally, but it is not just the mom-and-pop crowd driv­ing de­mand. Big-name money man­agers, in­clud­ing Te­masek, T. Rowe Price Group and UBS As­set Man­age­ment, are also an­gling for al­lo­ca­tions. In­sti­tu­tions and strate­gic in­vestors may take up about 96 per cent of the of­fer­ing in Shang­hai and 97.5 per cent in Hong Kong, ac­cord­ing to Ant’s prospec­tus.</p>
    <p>Re­tail in­vestors are still likely to have a sig­nif­i­cant im­pact once trad­ing be­gins – par­tic­u­larly in Shang­hai where in­di­vid­u­als drive the vast ma­jor­ity of daily turnover. About 5.16 mil­lion re­tail ac­counts placed a record 19.05 tril­lion yuan (S$3.9 tril­lion) of or­ders for Ant shares on the city’s Star mar­ket, where traders are re­quired to have a min­i­mum 500,000 yuan in their ac­counts.</p>
    <p>In Hong Kong, the re­tail por­tion drew more than HK$1.3 tril­lion of or­ders as of 11am yes­ter­day, or 394 times the ini­tial sup­ply, the South China Morn­ing Post re­ported, cit­ing peo­ple in the know.</p>
    <p>Many in­vestors in the city took ad­van­tage of his­tor­i­cally low in­ter­est rates to am­plify their bets with bor­rowed money.</p>
    <p>“There has been un­prece­dented in­vestor in­ter­est,” said Mr Jasper Chan, as­sis­tant man­ager of cor­po­rate fi­nance at Phillip Se­cu­ri­ties, which al­lo­cated all of the HK$20 bil­lion it set aside for Ant mar­gin loans on the first day they be­came avail­able. Mr Chan said de­mand for the IPO has been more broad­based than usual be­cause of the small min­i­mum lot size of 50 shares, which equates to about HK$4,040.</p>
    <p>Ms Yuki Chung, a 30-year-old univer­sity teach­ing as­sis­tant, said she plans to bid for HK$500,000 of Ant shares, 90 per cent of which will be funded by bor­rowed money. “Ev­ery­one is tak­ing part in the IPO, so I feel like I should too. I don’t want to lose out.”</p>
    <p>Oth­ers are wary of plac­ing too much faith in a rally. Me­dia pro­fes­sional Elle Lam, 28, who has in­vested in sev­eral Hong Kong IPOs this year, plans to or­der just one 50-share lot of Ant, us­ing the rest of her avail­able cash to bid on the Hong Kong govern­ment’s up­com­ing is­suance of in­fla­tion-linked bonds. “Peo­ple are cer­tainly too hyped up,” Ms Lam said. “I think Ant’s val­u­a­tion is too ex­pen­sive, so the gain on the de­but day could be lim­ited.”</p>
