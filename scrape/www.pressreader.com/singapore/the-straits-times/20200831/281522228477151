    <p>Em­ploy­ees of Mustafa Cen­tre who have not been called back to work have been asked to find a sec­ond job to earn an in­come, af­ter the com­pany an­nounced it will stop pay­ing them al­lowance from Oc­to­ber.</p>
    <p>And its for­eign work­ers whose work passes have ex­pired will be sent home, as the iconic mall in Lit­tle In­dia strug­gles to cope with the fall­out from Covid-19.</p>
    <p>Founder Mus­taq Ah­mad said in a let­ter ad­dressed to all staff last Thurs­day that the com­pany is un­able to re­new the work passes of its for­eign work­ers and will pay for their ticket home. It will also waive no­tice pe­ri­ods for em­ploy­ees who opt to re­sign.</p>
    <p>Both groups of work­ers will be given a month’s ba­sic salary.</p>
    <p>Mustafa Cen­tre will send home its for­eign work­ers whose work passes have ex­pired as its busi­ness has been hard hit by the Covid-19 pan­demic.</p>
    <p>The com­pany will also stop a “sus­te­nance al­lowance” for em­ploy­ees who have not been called to work – be­lieved to be $300 a month – and urged this group of staff to take on a sec­ond job to earn an in­come.</p>
    <p>In a let­ter ad­dressed to all em­ploy­ees of Mustafa group and its re­lated com­pa­nies, man­ag­ing di­rec­tor and founder Mus­taq Ah­mad said the com­pany is un­able to re­new the work passes of its for­eign work­ers and will pay for their ticket home.</p>
    <p>It will give these for­eign work­ers a to­ken sum of a month’s ba­sic salary, he said in the let­ter dated last Thurs­day and seen by The Straits Times yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>“We re­gret to have to re­sort to these de­ci­sions but hope that busi­ness will come back to nor­mal as soon as pos­si­ble,” he added.</p>
    <p>The Mustafa group did not get back to The Straits Times on how many of its lo­cal and for­eign staff are af­fected by the mea­sures.</p>
    <p>In the let­ter, Mr Mus­taq said the com­pany will stop pay­ing the sus­te­nance al­lowance – given to staff since June – from Oct 1 as it needs to re­duce pay­roll costs.</p>
    <p>Busi­ness has been badly af­fected by the coro­n­avirus, he said, not­ing that not all em­ploy­ees can re­turn to work due to re­duced open­ing hours and strict safe dis­tanc­ing mea­sures at the pop­u­lar shop­ping mall.</p>
    <p>“We do not ex­pect our busi­ness to re­turn to the pre-Covid days as our in­ter­na­tional bor­ders are all closed. It will take longer than ex­pected,” he added.</p>
    <p>A man­ager at the store, who did not want to be iden­ti­fied, said busi­ness has plum­meted to just 20 per cent of pre-Covid-19 lev­els.</p>
    <p>Tourists and for­eign work­ers used to be the store’s main cus­tomer base, but they have “all but dis­ap­peared”, said the man­ager.</p>
    <p>Mr Mus­taq, who noted that some staff have be­gun find­ing jobs else­where, said the com­pany will waive no­tice pe­ri­ods for res­ig­na­tions and give those who re­sign a month’s ba­sic salary as a to­ken of ap­pre­ci­a­tion.</p>
    <p>The com­pany is also work­ing with the Sin­ga­pore Man­ual and Mer­can­tile Work­ers Union, the Em­ploy­ment and Em­ploy­a­bil­ity In­sti­tute (e2i) and Na­tional Trades Union Con­gress to help its staff find jobs, he said.</p>
    <p>The woes of the six-storey mall in Syed Alwi Road in Lit­tle In­dia be­gan af­ter it was iden­ti­fied as a Covid-19 clus­ter and closed on April 2. It is be­lieved to have been the starting point for thou­sands of coro­n­avirus in­fec­tions in for­eign worker dor­mi­to­ries.</p>
    <p>Work­ers were likely in­fected af</p>
    <p>NO OTHER WAY We re­gret to have to re­sort to these de­ci­sions but hope that busi­ness will come back to nor­mal as soon as pos­si­ble. ’’</p>
    <p>MAN­AG­ING DI­REC­TOR AND FOUNDER MUS­TAQ AH­MAD, in a let­ter ad­dressed to all em­ploy­ees of Mustafa group and its re­lated com­pa­nies.</p>
    <p>ter vis­it­ing the cen­tre, where some em­ploy­ees had fallen ill, and they set off a chain of in­fec­tions among co-work­ers and dor­mi­tory mates.</p>
    <p>Mustafa Cen­tre re­opened on May 6 from 9.30am to 11.30pm daily, with the in­ten­tion of re­sum­ing its trade­mark 24-hour oper­a­tions soon.</p>
    <p>But al­most four months later, the mall has not done so, ow­ing to high op­er­a­tional costs and a lack of cash flow due to the drop in busi­ness.</p>
    <p>While there were still some shop­pers in the store when ST vis­ited Mustafa Cen­tre yes­ter­day, it was no­tice­ably less busy, with no queue­ing needed to en­ter the premises.</p>
    <p>Sun­days were typ­i­cally the busiest days for Mustafa Cen­tre, with many for­eign work­ers shop­ping there on their day off. But this source of busi­ness has been largely shut down, with most work­ers in dor­mi­to­ries con­fined to their quar­ters due to Covid-19.</p>
    <p>Staff of Mustafa Cen­tre told ST yes­ter­day they do not know which col­leagues were be­ing sent home, but added that foot­fall at the mall is a far cry from what it used to be.</p>
    <p>The man­ager said: “With­out these tourists and for­eign­ers, it is un­likely that we can stay open or keep work­ing for much longer.”</p>
