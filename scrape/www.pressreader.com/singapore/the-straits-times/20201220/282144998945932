    <p>When din­ing-in was halted dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker from April to June, restau­ra­teurs racked their brains for ways to make up for the loss in business. One of the best ideas was the DIY cook­ing kit. Take­away and de­liv­ery food, while con­ve­nient, is of­ten past its prime by the time it gets to the diner, so why not let the cus­tomer him­self make a pip­ing hot meal with an easy guide?</p>
    <p>Al­though a cou­ple of restau­rants like Sum­mer Hill al­ready had DIY cook­ing kits, the pan­demic turned it into a trend.</p>
    <p>The mostly raw food is de­liv­ered chilled or frozen with an in­struc­tion card on how to cook the dish. Some also have a QR code that links to a cook­ing video by the chef.</p>
    <p>Ital­ian restau­rant Amo was among the first to latch onto the idea in May with its pizza and pasta kits, along with other West­ern and Asian restau­rants like Level 33, Buona Terra and Quentin’s.</p>
    <p>Chi­nese restau­rant chains Crys­tal Jade and Par­adise Group soon fol­lowed with stir-fries and dumplings. And Ip­pudo of­fered ra­men and gy­oza kits.</p>
    <p>One of the lat­est on the mar­ket is the dry laksa kit from on­line seller 2 Ma­mas & A Wok. It comes with a spice mix, rice noo­dles, fish­cake, taupok, beansprout­s and co­conut milk, and you fry ev­ery­thing to­gether.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing the Sin­ga­pore Food Fes­ti­val in Au­gust, kits were also sold for those who wished to cook along with live streams of mas­ter cook­ing classes by chefs such as Vi­o­let Oon and Ming Tan.</p>
    <p>Pas­tas are the most id­iot-proof as they of­ten come with ready house­made sauces. Those from Buona Terra (above) are of restau­rant qual­ity.</p>
    <p>The stir-fried black pep­per beef with cap­sicum from Crys­tal Jade turns out very well too.</p>
    <p>Oth­ers, like Amo’s pizza and Par­adise’s xiao long bao, are fun to put to­gether and you can make it a fam­ily ac­tiv­ity by rop­ing in the kids.</p>
    <p>Now that restau­rants are once again pack­ing them in, chilled DIY cook­ing kits – which can­not be kept for more than a few days – may not be as hot any­more. But the frozen ones like Ip­pudo’s gy­oza are still great to have on hand for days when you do not feel like din­ing out.</p>
