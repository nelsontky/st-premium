    <p>The weather may be blow­ing hot and cold some­times, but it can get rather hot and hu­mid work­ing from home.</p>
    <p>To keep your util­ity bill from ris­ing along with the tem­per­a­ture, here are four tips to stay cool with­out work­ing the air-con­di­tioner over­time.</p>
    <p>1 STAY HYDRATED</p>
    <p>As our bod­ies main­tain their tem­per­a­ture through per­spi­ra­tion, get­ting enough wa­ter is al­ways the main con­sid­er­a­tion in hot weather, says Mr Chan Joy Seng, di­rec­tor and nu­tri­tion­ist at Alive Nu­tri­tion Con­sul­tancy.</p>
    <p>It is rec­om­mended that adults drink about eight glasses (or 2 litres) of wa­ter a day, and even more if one is ex­posed to heat, ex­er­cises a lot or is preg­nant, breast­feed­ing or un­well.</p>
    <p>Over­all fluid in­take can be in­creased by con­sum­ing foods with high wa­ter con­tent, such as por­ridge, soups or stews, and fruit and veg­eta­bles such as wa­ter­melon, berries, cu­cum­ber, cel­ery and let­tuce.</p>
    <p>While the phys­i­cal tem­per­a­ture of drinks does not di­rectly af­fect the hy­dra­tion sta­tus of the hu­man body, Mr Chan says: “A per­son may drink more wa­ter when the wa­ter is cold rather than warm, due to the cool­ing sen­sa­tion sim­i­lar to mint.”</p>
    <p>You do not need to avoid drink­ing cof­fee or tea ei­ther.</p>
    <p>While caf­feinated bev­er­ages may have a mild di­uretic ef­fect and cause the need to uri­nate, nor­mal con­sump­tion is not shown to di­rectly in­crease the risk of de­hy­dra­tion.</p>
    <p>2 COOL FOODS</p>
    <p>In tra­di­tional Chi­nese medicine, “cold” and “cool­ing” foods can help</p>
    <p>“re­move tox­ins, clear the bow­els and elim­i­nate body heat”, says physi­cian Ng Qing Xiang of Eu Yan Sang TCM clinic.</p>
    <p>These in­clude green bean soup, chrysan­the­mum tea, green tea, bit­ter gourd, win­ter melon, man­gos­teen and monk fruit.</p>
    <p>3 KNOW YOUR FABRICS</p>
    <p>The ma­te­ri­als you wear mat­ter.</p>
    <p>Mr Martin Bon­ney, fash­ion lec­turer at Lasalle Col­lege of the Arts, sug­gests choos­ing plant-based fi­bres such as ten­cel, bam­boo and vis­cose, which help reg­u­late body tem­per­a­ture as they are breath­able and ab­sorb per­spi­ra­tion quickly.</p>
    <p>Choose some­thing light­weight, he says, and check the thick­ness of the fab­ric if the weather is warm.</p>
    <p>Some brands may have cloth­ing lines with spe­cially treated mois­ture-wick­ing sur­faces to keep you cool and dry, and you can iden­tify them by check­ing the la­bel.</p>
    <p>“I would avoid syn­thetic fabrics such as polyester and ny­lon,” he says.</p>
    <p>4 USE YOUR WIN­DOWS</p>
    <p>The key to cool­ing your home is by in­creas­ing air cir­cu­la­tion and ven­ti­la­tion, says en­gi­neer Joseph Goh, who is also deputy chair­man of the me­chan­i­cal and elec­tri­cal engi­neer­ing tech­ni­cal com­mit­tee at the In­sti­tute Of Engi­neers, Singapore.</p>
    <p>But while you can let the breeze in through win­dows, re­mem­ber to close them when it gets hot­ter around noon as the tem­per­a­ture tends to be higher out­doors than in­doors.</p>
    <p>Win­dow blinds or cur­tains are a good way to block out the heat if you do not mind a dim room.</p>
