    <p>CAUSE FOR CON­CERN</p>
    <p>Of course we’re wor­ried (about the win­ter), def­i­nitely there’s a sense of worry (of a resur­gence of cases). I fear the day I get in­fected.</p>
    <p>MS TAO MEIZHEN, a trainee nurse.</p>
    <p>WUHAN • As­so­ci­ated with the ear­li­est out­break of Covid-19 in the world, the Hua­nan Seafood Whole­sale Mar­ket has been shut since Jan 1.</p>
    <p>Xin­hua Road, which sep­a­rates the east and west sec­tions of the mar­ket, is a far cry from the busy thor­ough­fare it used to be, de­spite be­ing lo­cated just a stone’s throw from one of Wuhan’s busiest rail­way sta­tions.</p>
    <p>Yet, in spite of the newly erected blue walls seal­ing off the mar­ket, life around it is claw­ing its way back.</p>
    <p>Af­ter rounds of clean­ing and dis­in­fec­tion, the eye­wear whole­sale mar­ket on the sec­ond floor has re­opened for busi­ness, while small shops on the pe­riph­ery that sur­vived the pan­demic are back, serv­ing cus­tomers steam­ing bowls of noo­dles.</p>
    <p>Strict virus con­trol measures now mean there is only one en­trance to the sec­ond floor. The other three are shut. All vis­i­tors must present a health code and have their tem­per­a­tures taken be­fore be­ing al­lowed to climb a set of rick­ety iron stairs to the op­ti­cal mar­ket.</p>
    <p>A labyrinth of iden­ti­cal units greets shop­pers on the sec­ond floor: glass fronts stacked with rows of spec­ta­cles, with more ly­ing on shelves in­side.</p>
    <p>Ven­dors were al­lowed to re­turn in May af­ter the ci­ty­wide lock­down was lifted, said a spec­ta­cle whole­saler who wanted to be known only as Mr Zhang.</p>
    <p>“We had to fill in all sorts of forms and take a nu­cleic acid test be­fore be­ing al­lowed to come back. But even then, we made sure to spend the first day back thor­oughly clean­ing our shops,” he told The Straits Times in his cor­ner unit, next to a row of win­dows over­look­ing Xin­hua Road.</p>
    <p>Sales have also been badly hit – cus­tomers are still wor­ried about vis­it­ing a lo­ca­tion where the coro­n­avirus first sur­faced.</p>
    <p>“But we have no choice, there’s nowhere else to go be­cause we’ve been here for six years, and all our other busi­ness part­ners are in the same mar­ket, so it’s eas­ier for us to op­er­ate,” Mr Zhang said.</p>
    <p>There was also a ner­vous ten­sion in the largely empty mar­ket, where sales staff out­num­bered shop­pers.</p>
    <p>Se­cu­rity was on the look­out for anyone try­ing to take pic­tures of the place, and ST jour­nal­ists were asked to leave af­ter be­ing spot­ted tak­ing videos. Shop­pers de­clined to be in­ter­viewed.</p>
    <p>Just one floor be­low was the seafood mar­ket, which sold a va­ri­ety of pro­duce, in­clud­ing live tur­tles and poul­try. It is long gone.</p>
    <p>Most of its ven­dors moved to Si­jimei, a mar­ket south of the city, or to the sprawl­ing Bais­hazhou whole­sale mar­ket in the east.</p>
    <p>A noo­dle seller out­side the Hua­nan mar­ket, who gave her name as Madam Chen, said the shops serv­ing ven­dors have been badly hit by the drop in busi­ness, with both her neigh­bours shut­ting for good.</p>
    <p>“In the past, we would sell hun­dreds of bowls of noo­dles ev­ery day to work­ers, shop­pers, ev­ery­one.</p>
    <p>“Now I’m happy to sell even 50 bowls,” she said.</p>
