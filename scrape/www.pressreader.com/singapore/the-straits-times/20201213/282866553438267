    <p>LON­DON • It has been 10 games this Premier League sea­son for As­ton Villa and man­ager Dean Smith be­lieves his play­ers have ex­ceeded ex­pec­ta­tions.</p>
    <p>Villa snatched a 1-0 win at Wolverhamp­ton Wan­der­ers yes­ter­day af­ter sub­sti­tute An­war El Ghazi drilled in a stop­page-time penalty as both sides fin­ished the game with 10 men.</p>
    <p>“I am pleased with the start we have had, this was a tough game and we de­served a point and we kept com­pet­ing and got the win,” said Smith, whose side have now claimed six vic­to­ries this term.</p>
    <p>“There was only the Leeds game that we de­served to get beaten (3-0) this sea­son. Ten games in this sea­son and, if you de­serve to get some­thing out of nine, you are do­ing well.”</p>
    <p>Villa had Dou­glas Luiz sent off in the 85th minute and Wolves mid­fielder Joao Moutinho was dis­missed shortly af­ter the vis­i­tors scored against the run of play, to regis­ter their fourth away win of the sea­son.</p>
    <p>The re­sult lifted Villa up to eighth on 18 points be­fore yes­ter­day’s later games. Wolves, again miss­ing in­jured striker Raul Jimenez, stayed 11th on 17 points from 12 games.</p>
    <p>The home side looked more likely to grab the win­ner in a dour clash, with their 18-year old striker Fabio Silva hit­ting the post mid­way through the sec­ond half as he made his first start for the club.</p>
    <p>Villa goal­keeper Emil­iano Martinez pulled off sev­eral fine saves, in­clud­ing a fierce Le­an­der Den­don­cker vol­ley 10 min­utes from time.</p>
    <p>When the match seemed to be head­ing for a draw, Wolves’ Nel­son Semedo hauled down John McGinn in the penalty area and El Ghazi made no mis­take with the spot kick.</p>
    <p>“It’s al­ways dis­ap­point­ing to lose in the end like that, es­pe­cially in a game where we played good,” Wolves boss Nuno Espir­ito Santo said.</p>
    <p>“We cre­ated a lot of good, clear chances and we will try to keep on grow­ing on this as­pect. Be­ing more clin­i­cal is some­thing that we need.”</p>
