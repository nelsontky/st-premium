    <p>More de­tails of the ef­fort to in­oc­u­late Sin­ga­pore­ans against Covid-19, in­clud­ing the dif­fer­ent phases of the vac­ci­na­tion pro­gramme and who will go through them, will hope­fully be re­leased by as early as next month, said Ed­u­ca­tion Min­is­ter Lawrence Wong yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The ex­act de­tails on the roll-out of the vac­cine will de­pend on mul­ti­ple vari­ables, in­clud­ing their sup­ply and de­liv­ery sched­ule, and when other vac­cines get au­tho­rised for use here, added Mr Wong, who co-chairs the multi-min­istry task force on Covid-19.</p>
    <p>These fac­tors are still un­cer­tain for now, he said.</p>
    <p>“When we have greater cer­tainty of when, what sort of sup­ply (and) de­liv­ery sched­ule we can ex­pect in Sin­ga­pore, that will be matched with the vac­ci­na­tion pro­gramme, the dif­fer­ent phases of vac­ci­na­tion,” said Mr Wong, a day af­ter Sin­ga­pore re­ceived its first ship­ment of the Pfizer-BioNTech vac­cine.</p>
    <p>The min­is­ter was speak­ing to re­porters at the Min­istry of Ed­u­ca­tion head­quar­ters about tighter bor­der mea­sures for trav­ellers from Bri­tain, where a highly con­ta­gious strain of the coro­n­avirus has been cir­cu­lat­ing.</p>
    <p>When asked for an es­ti­mate on the fre­quency of vac­cines com­ing in, Mr Wong said it is pre­ma­ture to do so, given that other vac­cines which Sin­ga­pore has ad­vance pur­chase agree­ments for have not yet been au­tho­rised for use here.</p>
    <p>These in­clude vac­cines by Moderna in the United States and Si­no­vac in China.</p>
    <p>But the Gov­ern­ment does have a rough sense of when fur­ther ship­ments of the Pfizer-BioNTech vac­cine as well as those from Moderna and Si­no­vac are go­ing to ar­rive, said the min­is­ter. “As­sum­ing all three are au­tho­rised for pan­demic use... we do have some rough in­di­ca­tion,” he said. “But it’s still early days, it’s still very pre­lim­i­nary, and it can change.”</p>
    <p>The Pfizer-BioNTech vac­cine has been ap­proved by the Health Sciences Au­thor­ity in Sin­ga­pore for in­di­vid­u­als aged 16 and above.</p>
    <p>Mr Wong said that as pre­vi­ously an­nounced by the task force, pri­or­ity for the vac­cines will be given to groups such as health­care and front-line work­ers.</p>
    <p>The first of the vac­cines will be ad­min­is­tered to these work­ers some time between the end of this month and Jan­uary or Fe­bru­ary, he said. “I think it will be some time be­fore we can talk about open­ing up and of­fer­ing the vac­cine to the broader pop­u­la­tion.”</p>
    <p>The roll-out to the Sin­ga­pore pop­u­la­tion will take place over sev­eral months, and if all goes to plan, Sin­ga­pore will have enough vac­cines to vac­ci­nate ev­ery­one by the third quar­ter of next year.</p>
    <p>But if other fac­tors arise, the vac­ci­na­tion pro­gramme could be pushed back to the end of next year or be­yond. Or if some vac­cines ar­rive ear­lier, this could be brought for­ward, said Mr Wong.</p>
    <p>When asked about the spread of the new and seem­ingly more in­fec­tious virus strain that has emerged in Bri­tain, Mr Wong said the new strain has not yet been de­tected in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>On whether the Gov­ern­ment is con­cerned that the vac­cines that have ar­rived would not be ef­fec­tive against that lat­est strain, he said: “That is un­cer­tain; this is part of the ques­tion that I think sci­en­tists ev­ery­where are ask­ing.”</p>
    <p>He added: “And I am sure our sci­en­tists and ex­perts, to­gether with ex­perts ev­ery­where in the world, will be ask­ing these ques­tions and seek­ing answers.”</p>
    <p>As for what Sin­ga­pore would do dif­fer­ently if the new strain is de­tected here, Mr Wong said the coun­try will have to be ex­tra cau­tious in im­ple­ment­ing ex­ist­ing safe­guards against the virus, in­clud­ing step­ping in quickly to iso­late close con­tacts each time an in­fected per­son is iden­ti­fied, so as to con­tain and ring-fence a pos­si­ble clus­ter.</p>
    <p>“But be­fore we even get there, we try our best to keep our bor­ders se­cure,” said Mr Wong.</p>
    <p>This is why Sin­ga­pore an­nounced yes­ter­day that it will deny en­try as well as tran­sit to all long-term pass hold­ers and short­term vis­i­tors with re­cent travel his­tory to Bri­tain, he noted.</p>
    <p>Still, no mea­sure is 100 per cent fool­proof, and the strain could still come through an­other coun­try, he said. “Again, we are in a new sit­u­a­tion, we have to stay vig­i­lant. We have to mon­i­tor how the virus is spread­ing, how the new strain is spread­ing ev­ery­where in the world, and then we have to con­stantly ad­just our mea­sures at the bor­ders and within the com­mu­nity ac­cord­ingly.”</p>
