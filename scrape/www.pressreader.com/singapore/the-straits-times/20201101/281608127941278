    <p>Home-grown depart­ment store Robin­sons has be­come the lat­est high-pro­file ca­su­alty in a grow­ing list of re­tail­ers that the Covid-19 pan­demic has claimed.</p>
    <p>Busi­ness ces­sa­tions in the re­tail trade sec­tor hit a 10-month high in Septem­ber, with 457 com­pa­nies call­ing it quits, ac­cord­ing to fig­ures from the Ac­count­ing and Cor­po­rate Reg­u­la­tory Author­ity.</p>
    <p>Top­shop, Esprit and Sport­slink were among those that have bowed out or moved their op­er­a­tions on­line as safety re­stric­tions and tighter purse strings dent store sales.</p>
    <p>An­other wave of clo­sures is ex­pected af­ter re­lief to pro­tect qual­i­fy­ing com­mer­cial ten­ants un­able to pay rent from evic­tion and hiked up in­ter­est rates ends on Nov 19, said re­tail­ers and ob­servers.</p>
    <p>Win­ter wear re­tailer Uni­ver­sal Trav­eller, for ex­am­ple, is fac­ing the pos­si­bil­ity of fold­ing if it is un­able to work out a rental pay­ment plan with land­lords for its five out­lets. With travel off the cards for most Sin­ga­pore­ans this year and few tourists in sight, its sales are down by up to 90 per cent. Re­serves are run­ning dry for the three-decade-old busi­ness, and piv­ot­ing is not easy with cash tied up in in­ven­tory, chief ex­ec­u­tive Trey Poh told The Sun­day Times.</p>
    <p>Mr Ter­ence Yow, a rep­re­sen­ta­tive of the Sin­ga­pore Ten­ants United For Fair­ness, said the vast ma­jor­ity of com­mer­cial ten­ants have not re­ceived much con­ces­sion from land­lords be­yond what has been man­dated by the Gov­ern­ment. “Many of us are fear­ing strict or harsh land­lord ac­tion the mo­ment the Gov­ern­ment lifts the mora­to­rium,” he said.</p>
    <p>Mr Yow said re­tail­ers are also hop­ing that safe dis­tanc­ing re­quire­ments at malls can be eased to help cap­ture more foot traf­fic dur­ing the year end and Chi­nese New Year shop­ping sea­sons. “It’s been a re­ally tough year for all of us and eas­ing th­ese re­quire­ments will go a long way to help more front-line busi­nesses sur­vive this cri­sis,” he said.</p>
    <p>Ms Chris­tine Li, head of re­search for Sin­ga­pore and South-east Asia at Cush­man and Wake­field, said that with more ca­su­al­ties ex­pected in the com­ing months, land­lords who need to boost va­cancy rates may have to lower their rental ex­pec­ta­tions and fo­cus on re­tain­ing ten­ants.</p>
    <p>Or­chard Road has been hit harder than neigh­bour­hood shop­ping ar­eas, Ms Li noted, with over­all prime re­tail rent in the shop­ping belt ex­pected to de­cline by 10 per cent this year, com­pared with 5 per cent in sub­ur­ban ar­eas.</p>
    <p>Mr Paul Khor, founder of life­style brand Ac­tu­ally and out­door re­tailer Out­side, said his out­lets in Paragon and Ma­rina Square have been hard hit by the loss of tourists. While on­line sales have tripled to about $60,000 a month with the launch of new e-com­merce stores, it has not been enough to cover the more than $1 mil­lion sales loss in the whole­sale ex­port side of the busi­ness, he said.</p>
    <p>Lo­cal fash­ion la­bel Sabri­nagoh has also been turn­ing to on­line sales to make up for the drop in foot­fall to its Or­chard Road and Raffles City stores, hir­ing for po­si­tions such as dig­i­tal con­tent cre­ator. It re­cently in­tro­duced an or­der-on-de­mand model, al­low­ing cus­tomers to pur­chase sold-out styles.</p>
    <p>“(This) en­ables us to es­ti­mate pro­duc­tion quan­ti­ties and save costs by not build­ing un­nec­es­sary in­ven­tory and cre­at­ing waste,” said the brand’s founder, Ms Sabrina Goh.</p>
    <p>Some mall oper­a­tors are in­vest­ing in e-com­merce plat­forms to help ten­ants drive on­line sales.</p>
    <p>Mr Tan Kee Yong, chief op­er­at­ing of­fi­cer for Frasers Prop­erty Re­tail, said it will launch an e-com­merce mar­ket­place for ten­ants by year end.</p>
    <p>Mr Chris Chong, Cap­i­taLand Sin­ga­pore’s man­ag­ing di­rec­tor for re­tail, said more than 500 mer­chants have signed up to its re­tail and food e-com­merce plat­forms launched in June, which are op­tional for all ten­ants and open to non-ten­ants.</p>
