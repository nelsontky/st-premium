    <p>Man­u­fac­tur­ing ended a tu­mul­tuous year on a high note with fac­tory ac­tiv­ity up again last month – its sixth con­sec­u­tive month of ex­pan­sion. Ex­perts say the sec­tor will con­tinue to be a key driver of eco­nomic growth this year, but warned that this could be tem­pered amid re­stric­tions as Covid-19 con­tin­ues to spread glob­ally.</p>
    <p>Man­u­fac­tur­ing ended a tu­mul­tuous year on a high note with fac­tory ac­tiv­ity up again in De­cem­ber – its sixth con­sec­u­tive month of ex­pan­sion.</p>
    <p>Ex­perts say the sec­tor will con­tinue to be a key driver of eco­nomic growth this year, but warned that this could be tem­pered amid re­stric­tions as the coro­n­avirus con­tin­ues to spread glob­ally.</p>
    <p>The Sin­ga­pore Pur­chas­ing Man­agers’ In­dex (PMI) – a key mea­sure of ac­tiv­ity – inched up 0.1 point last month from Novem­ber to 50.5, ac­cord­ing to data out yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>A read­ing above 50 in­di­cates ex­pan­sion; one be­low points to con­trac­tion.</p>
    <p>The elec­tron­ics sec­tor also posted growth for the fifth straight month, with ex­pan­sion of 0.1 point from Novem­ber to a level of 51.2 – the high­est read­ing since the 51.4 recorded in Septem­ber 2018.</p>
    <p>Last month’s man­u­fac­tur­ing growth was at­trib­uted to slightly higher ex­pan­sion rates in the in­dexes of new or­ders, fac­tory out­put and in­ven­tory, said the Sin­ga­pore In­sti­tute of Pur­chas­ing and Ma­te­ri­als Man­age­ment (SIPMM), which pub­lishes the monthly PMI read­ings.</p>
    <p>The em­ploy­ment i ndex also shrank more slowly but has recorded con­trac­tions for 11 con­sec­u­tive months.</p>
    <p>How­ever, the new ex­ports in­dex posted a lower ex­pan­sion rate, sug­gest­ing that the higher growth rate in new or­ders is be­ing fu­elled by do­mes­tic con­sump­tion.</p>
    <p>The em­ploy­ment in­dex con­tin­ued to ex­pand in the elec­tron­ics sec­tor for the sec­ond month.</p>
    <p>But the elec­tron­ics sup­plier de­liv­er­ies in­dex recorded con­trac­tion for the 11th con­sec­u­tive month, in­di­cat­ing pos­si­ble sup­ply dis­rup­tions due to Covid-19 re­stric­tions around the world, noted the SIPMM.</p>
    <p>Ms Sophia Poh, SIPMM vice-pres­i­dent for in­dus­try en­gage­ment and de­vel­op­ment, said: “It is heart­en­ing to note that the (man­u­fac­tur­ing) sec­tor is look­ing ahead to a brighter out­look for the new year even though it will take some time be­fore wide-scale vac­ci­na­tion pro­grammes can be i mple­mented glob­ally.”</p>
    <p>OCBC Bank head of trea­sury re­search and strat­egy Se­lena Ling agreed that while man­u­fac­tur­ing has been the sil­ver lin­ing for last year, global de­mand and re­cov­ery will be very much de­pen­dent on the Covid-19 sit­u­a­tion and vac­ci­na­tion progress.</p>
    <p>“If there is fur­ther progress made to­wards the re­open­ing of</p>
    <p>borders later this year, this may aid the re­cov­ery in busi­ness and con­sumer con­fi­dence,” she said.</p>
    <p>She noted that the slow­ing growth of China’s man­u­fac­tur­ing PMI sug­gests that momentum may have peaked or is near­ing a peak, which may be mir­rored in other Asian man­u­fac­tur­ing read­ings in the com­ing months too.</p>
    <p>May­bank Kim Eng se­nior econ­o­mist Chua Hak Bin said: “Man­u­fac­tur­ing will con­tinue to ex­pand at a healthy pace in 2021, but will likely mod­er­ate from the strong growth seen in 2020.</p>
    <p>“De­mand may cool off be­cause of re­newed lock­downs in many de­vel­oped coun­tries. Sup­ply re­sponse may be con­strained by avail­abil­ity of for­eign labour, due to both stricter govern­ment mea­sures and bor­der con­trols.”</p>
