    <p>LOS AN­GE­LES • Amer­i­can ac­tress Gwyneth Pal­trow says de­cid­ing to split with her first hus­band Chris Martin was painful enough. How­ever, noth­ing could have pre­pared her for the public mock­ery that greeted the an­nounce­ment of their “con­scious un­cou­pling”.</p>
    <p>That was the phrase used by the ac­tress and the Cold­play front­man when they an­nounced in 2014 that they were sep­a­rat­ing af­ter 10 years of mar­riage, but hoped to re­main close friends.</p>
    <p>In an es­say in the Septem­ber is­sue of Bri­tish Vogue magazine, Pal­trow, who won the Best Ac­tress Oscar for her role in Shakespear­e In Love (1998), said she knew the celebrity split would get at­ten­tion.</p>
    <p>“But I never could have an­tic­i­pated what came next. The public’s sur­prise gave way quickly to ire and de­ri­sion. A strange com­bi­na­tion of mock­ery and anger that I had never seen,” Pal­trow, 47, wrote. “The in­ten­sity of the re­sponse saw me bury my head in the sand deeper than I ever had in my very public life.”</p>
    <p>Pal­trow, who is also the founder of life­style com­pany Goop, said the phrase “con­scious un­cou­pling” was in­tro­duced by the cou­ple’s ther­a­pist as they were work­ing out how to avoid ac­ri­mony and stay close de­spite their split. “Frankly, the term sounded a bit full of it­self, painfully pro­gres­sive and hard to swal­low... I was in­trigued, less by the phrase, but by the sen­ti­ment,” she said.</p>
    <p>Pal­trow – who has a daugh­ter, 16, and a son, 14, with Martin – re­mar­ried in 2018 to tele­vi­sion pro­ducer Brad Falchuk, 49. Martin, 43, at­tended the wed­ding and joined the new­ly­weds on their hon­ey­moon.</p>
    <p>She said times have changed in the way peo­ple treat their break-ups. “In­stead of peo­ple ap­proach­ing me with, ‘Why did you say that?’, they now ap­proach me with, ‘How do you do that?’,” she said.</p>
