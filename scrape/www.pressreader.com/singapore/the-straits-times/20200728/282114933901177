    <p>A com­pany’s con­trol­ling direc­tor was fined $25,000 and or­dered to pay a penalty of $955,580 yes­ter­day for in­cor­rect dec­la­ra­tion of direc­tors’ fees in cor­po­rate in­come tax re­turns.</p>
    <p>Tan Hwa Luck, 75, was charged with giv­ing in­cor­rect in­for­ma­tion with­out any rea­son­able ex­cuse in Hwa Luck In­vest­ments’ cor­po­rate in­come tax re­turns, re­sult­ing in $763,285 in to­tal tax un­der­charged be­tween 1995 and 2007.</p>
    <p>Hwa Luck In­vest­ments had de­clared in its cor­po­rate in­come tax re­turns that direc­tors’ fees amount­ing to a to­tal of $3,386,000 had been in­curred as ex­pen­di­tures be­tween 1995 and 2007.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing an au­dit con­ducted by the In­land Revenue Au­thor­ity of Sin­ga­pore (Iras) be­tween 2012 and 2013, Tan claimed that the direc­tors’ fees were paid out to four direc­tors in two lump-sum pay­ments in 2006 and 2009.</p>
    <p>To sub­stan­ti­ate his claims, Tan pre­sented che­ques, pay­ment vouch­ers and bank state­ments to Iras.</p>
    <p>How­ever, in­ves­ti­ga­tions re­vealed that the four direc­tors did not re­ceive any lump-sum pay­ment of direc­tors’ fees, and that the payee of the lump-sum direc­tors’ fees was Tan. The monies were even­tu­ally routed back into Hwa Luck In­vest­ments’ cor­po­rate bank ac­count.</p>
    <p>Of the 13 charges Tan ini­tially faced, only five charges – for which the tax un­der­charged amounted to $477,790 – pro­ceeded to court.</p>
    <p>The re­main­ing eight charges were taken into con­sid­er­a­tion for the pur­poses of sen­tenc­ing.</p>
    <p>In a state­ment is­sued yes­ter­day, Iras re­minded mem­bers of the pub­lic that any busi­ness that gives in­cor­rect in­for­ma­tion in its in­come tax re­turns with­out rea­son­able ex­cuse may face a penalty that is twice the amount of tax un­der­charged, and jail.</p>
    <p>Those who help the au­thor­i­ties take er­rant busi­nesses and in­di­vid­u­als to task will be re­warded with 15 per cent of the tax re­cov­ered, capped at $100,000.</p>
    <p>All pay­ments are at the dis­cre­tion of the Comptrolle­r and Iras will en­sure that the iden­ti­ties of in­for­mants are kept strictly con­fi­den­tial.</p>
