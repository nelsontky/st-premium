    <p>Many things about the coro­n­avirus were still un­known in the first half of the year, but Sin­ga­pore knew it had to act fast to se­cure Covid-19 vac­cine doses for its peo­ple.</p>
    <p>This was even though some so­lu­tions were as novel as the pathogen it­self – a num­ber of vac­cine can­di­dates were be­ing de­vel­oped with new tech­nolo­gies that had not been used in any other vac­cines on the mar­ket.</p>
    <p>The data was lim­ited, so risks had to be taken and bets made, af­ter care­ful anal­y­sis of the avail­able in­for­ma­tion.</p>
    <p>They all paid off on Mon­day night, when Sin­ga­pore be­came the first na­tion in Asia to re­ceive doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech Covid-19 vac­cine. This, just weeks af­ter Bri­tain and the United States re­ceived theirs.</p>
    <p>Pro­fes­sor Ben­jamin Seet, who over­sees the ex­pert panel that pro­vides the Sin­ga­pore Gov­ern­ment with ad­vice on Covid-19 ther­a­peu­tics and vac­cines, said dur­ing a press con­fer­ence on Mon­day that ad­vance pur­chase agree­ments hinged on many fac­tors, in­clud­ing safety and avail­abil­ity.</p>
    <p>“If we want to buy it, will it be avail­able? Be­cause the doses could ac­tu­ally be bought up by big­ger ju­ris­dic­tions – for ex­am­ple we have seen from the global me­dia, the United States, Euro­pean Union, many of the larger economies have bought huge chunks,” said Prof Seet, who is deputy group chief ex­ec­u­tive for ed­u­ca­tion and re­search at the Na­tional Health­care Group.</p>
    <p>“So es­sen­tially, to even put our­selves in the early or­der book, we need to make de­ci­sions as early as pos­si­ble. And that’s why we have ad­vance pur­chase agree­ments.”</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore signed its first ad­vance pur­chase agree­ment in June with Moderna – the Amer­i­can biotech­nol­ogy firm be­hind one of the early Covid-19 vac­cine front run­ners – to buy its vac­cine.</p>
    <p>A down pay­ment was made to se­cure the agree­ment.</p>
    <p>At least two other agree­ments with vac­cine devel­op­ers Pfiz­erBioNTech and Si­no­vac were inked later, and ef­forts are still on­go­ing to short­list and pro­cure other vac­cine can­di­dates as part of Sin­ga­pore’s plan to en­sure a di­verse port­fo­lio of Covid-19 vac­cines.</p>
    <p>Ear­lier this month, Prime Min­is­ter Lee Hsien Loong said that if all went ac­cord­ing to plan, Sin­ga­pore would have enough vac­cines for ev­ery­one here by the third quar­ter of next year.</p>
    <p>Mr Leo Yip, head of the Civil Ser­vice and chair of the plan­ning group on vac­cines and ther­a­peu­tics, said the 11 months it took from Covid-19 ar­riv­ing on Sin­ga­pore’s shores to when it re­ceived its first ship­ment of vac­cines was no fluke.</p>
    <p>He said: “This was due to the sig­nif­i­cant ad­vances in vac­cine tech­nol­ogy. But it was also due to the dozens of pub­lic of­fi­cers who worked tire­lessly and qui­etly be­hind the scenes over this pe­riod, to en­sure that Sin­ga­pore had early ac­cess to vac­cines.”</p>
    <p>STEP 1: IDEN­TIFY</p>
    <p>Knowl­edge is power, es­pe­cially when it comes to a novel pathogen never be­fore seen by the world.</p>
    <p>So in April, Sin­ga­pore took steps to en­sure that it had ac­cess to all avail­able in­for­ma­tion on the vac­cine front.</p>
    <p>The na­tion’s first move was to form the ther­a­peu­tics and vac­cines ex­pert panel, which is led by Prof Seet. The panel com­prises 18 sci­en­tists and clin­i­cians from the pub­lic and pri­vate sec­tor, who went through data on po­ten­tial drugs to treat the dis­ease, as well as more than 35 vac­cine can­di­dates.</p>
    <p>Their aim was to iden­tify the most promis­ing ones and as­sess which were safe and ef­fi­ca­cious for Sin­ga­pore to pro­cure.</p>
    <p>There are cur­rently 56 Covid-19 vac­cine can­di­dates in clin­i­cal tri­als, and many of them are based on dif­fer­ent tech­nolo­gies, such as in­ac­ti­vated viruses, vi­ral vec­tors, and DNA/RNA. All of them work in dif­fer­ent ways.</p>
    <p>Tra­di­tional vac­cines, such as in­ac­ti­vated virus vac­cines and live at­ten­u­ated vac­cines, work by in­ject­ing whole but in­ac­tive viruses into pa­tients to stim­u­late an im­mune re­ac­tion.</p>
    <p>“But we even­tu­ally l ooked at RNA vac­cines with a lot more in­ter­est, par­tic­u­larly be­cause they were eas­ier to man­u­fac­ture. And there­fore, they could go into clin­i­cal tri­als ear­lier, and be made avail­able glob­ally in the l arge quan­ti­ties needed,” Prof Seet said.</p>
    <p>“So it was in­ter­est­ing from the point that you can get it fast. And you could get it in a timely man­ner. And you could get more data about it, very early,” he added.</p>
    <p>The Pfizer-BioNTech vac­cine ap­proved for use in Sin­ga­pore, for in­stance, is an RNA vac­cine.</p>
    <p>So is the Moderna shot, which</p>
    <p>IDEN­TI­FY­ING PROMIS­ING CAN­DI­DATES We even­tu­ally looked at RNA vac­cines with a lot more in­ter­est, par­tic­u­larly be­cause they were eas­ier to man­u­fac­ture. And there­fore, they could go into clin­i­cal tri­als ear­lier, and be made avail­able glob­ally in the large quan­ti­ties needed. So it was in­ter­est­ing from the point that you can get it fast. And you could get it in a timely man­ner. And you could get more data about it, very early. PRO­FES­SOR BEN­JAMIN SEET, deputy group chief ex­ec­u­tive for ed­u­ca­tion and re­search at the Na­tional Health­care Group. He over­sees the ex­pert panel that pro­vides the Sin­ga­pore Gov­ern­ment with ad­vice on Covid-19 ther­a­peu­tics and vac­cines. There are cur­rently 56 Covid-19 vac­cine can­di­dates in clin­i­cal tri­als, and many of them are based on dif­fer­ent tech­nolo­gies, such as in­ac­ti­vated viruses, vi­ral vec­tors, and DNA/RNA. All of them work in dif­fer­ent ways. Tra­di­tional vac­cines, such as in­ac­ti­vated virus vac­cines and live at­ten­u­ated vac­cines, work by in­ject­ing whole but in­ac­tive viruses into pa­tients to stim­u­late an im­mune re­ac­tion.</p>
    <p>was re­cently ap­proved for use in the United States, as well as the Lu­nar-Cov19 vac­cine be­ing co-de­vel­oped by sci­en­tists at the Duke-NUS Med­i­cal School.</p>
    <p>RNA vac­cines work by in­ject­ing snip­pets of the vi­ral ge­netic code so a pa­tient’s body mounts a pro­tec­tive re­sponse with­out be­ing ac­tu­ally ex­posed to the whole virus.</p>
    <p>Data from late-stage clin­i­cal tri­als re­leased last month by Pfiz­erBioNTech and Moderna showed high suc­cess rates of more than 90 per cent ef­fec­tive­ness at pre­vent­ing Covid-19.</p>
    <p>But to make the right de­ci­sions, Sin­ga­pore had to find other ways in the ear­lier months of get­ting the in­for­ma­tion it needed on which vac­cines to buy.</p>
    <p>STEP 2: IN­VES­TI­GATE</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore’s next step in late April was to form an­other group to make “strate­gic bets” on vac­cines that looked promis­ing, said Mr Yip, who chaired the plan­ning group.</p>
    <p>Its mis­sion was to pro­cure and sup­port the devel­op­ment of promis­ing ther­a­peu­tics as well as to se­cure early ac­cess to vac­cines for Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>This group re­lied on the as­sess­ments made by the sci­en­tific panel.</p>
    <p>“We re­lied on EDB of­fi­cers to es­tab­lish con­tact with a wide range of vac­cine mak­ers,” said Mr Yip, re­fer­ring to the Eco­nomic Devel­op­ment Board.</p>
    <p>“We lever­aged the strong re­la­tion­ships built up between EDB Sin­ga­pore and phar­ma­ceu­ti­cal com­pa­nies like Pfizer, as well as biotech com­pa­nies like Moderna and BioNTech.”</p>
    <p>Non-dis­clo­sure agree­ments were also signed with a num­ber of the com­pa­nies, he added, which gave Sin­ga­pore ac­cess to con­fi­den­tial data on the progress of the vac­cines.</p>
    <p>Typ­i­cally, data from clin­i­cal stud­ies is made pub­lic when they are pub­lished in sci­en­tific jour­nals. But the process of peer re­view may take some time.</p>
    <p>Prof Seet said Sin­ga­pore signed about 40 non-dis­clo­sure agree­ments. “This al­lows us to get ac­cess to data that is not avail­able in the pub­lished lit­er­a­ture – to get it early and to be able to find out more from the teams that ac­tu­ally de­vel­oped the drugs,” he said.</p>
    <p>None of these agree­ments was con­trac­tual, he clar­i­fied. This means that Sin­ga­pore was not obliged to pur­chase any vac­cines from the firm with whom it had signed the non-dis­clo­sure agree­ments.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore’s ap­proach to se­cur­ing vac­cines was not dis­sim­i­lar to how the coun­try se­cures ac­cess to other vi­tal re­sources like food and en­ergy, which is to di­ver­sify its sources.</p>
    <p>Mr Yip said it was im­por­tant for Sin­ga­pore to se­lect a port­fo­lio of vac­cine can­di­dates as there was no cer­tainty which, even among the more promis­ing ones, would even­tu­ally suc­ceed.</p>
    <p>STEP 3: NE­GO­TI­ATE</p>
    <p>More than $1 bil­lion has been set aside to sup­port Sin­ga­pore’s search for vac­cines.</p>
    <p>Dr Lisa Ooi, vice-pres­i­dent for health­care and well­ness at EDB, said other than pro­cure­ment, the budget funds re­lated needs.</p>
    <p>This in­cludes Sin­ga­pore’s par­tic­i­pa­tion in the mul­ti­lat­eral Covax ini­tia­tive meant to en­sure equitable vac­cine ac­cess world­wide, as well as sup­port for lo­cal devel­op­ment of ther­a­peu­tics and vac­cines, and sup­port for com­pa­nies that man­u­fac­ture vac­cines here in the longer term.</p>
    <p>EDB de­clined to com­ment on how much each of the vac­cines cost.</p>
    <p>When asked whether Sin­ga­pore’s rel­a­tively small or­der af­fected its bar­gain­ing power with phar­ma­ceu­ti­cal com­pa­nies, EDB’s se­nior vice-pres­i­dent and head for health­care and well­ness Goh Wan Yee said many phar­ma­ceu­ti­cal firms recog­nise Sin­ga­pore’s sta­tus as a lead­ing bio­med­i­cal hub in Asia.</p>
    <p>“So I think that po­si­tion, plus the fact that many com­pa­nies ac­tu­ally have a base in Sin­ga­pore, put us on good foot­ing to ne­go­ti­ate and work with them on vac­cine ac­cess,” said Ms Goh.</p>
    <p>“So de­spite our small mar­ket size I think com­pa­nies are still keen to have their prod­ucts launched and used in Sin­ga­pore.”</p>
