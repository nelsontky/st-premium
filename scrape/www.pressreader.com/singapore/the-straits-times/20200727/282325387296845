    <p>NEW YORK • The WTA has a ready strat­egy to cope with the fi­nan­cial strain caused by the Covid-19 pan­demic but chief ex­ec­u­tive Steve Si­mon thinks that the elite women’s Tour will not re­turn to any sem­blance of nor­mal­ity be­fore 2022.</p>
    <p>The Women’s Ten­nis As­so­ci­a­tion, which has lost a big chunk of tour­na­ments since the forced shut­down in early March, will fi­nally re­sume com­pe­ti­tion af­ter a five­month break with the Palermo Open from Aug 3.</p>
    <p>All of its tour­na­ments in China this year were can­celled on Fri­day af­ter the coun­try’s Sports Min­istry said it would not host any in­ter­na­tional events apart from 2022 Win­ter Olympic tri­als.</p>
    <p>“The WTA is no dif­fer­ent than any other busi­ness in this world and ev­ery­body’s been af­fected fi­nan­cially by this,” Si­mon told Reuters from the United States.</p>
    <p>“And we’ve been hit hard, just as many other com­pa­nies have been. If we’re not op­er­at­ing and you’re los­ing 50 to 60 per cent of your year... your rev­enues are go­ing to drop sig­nif­i­cantly... But we do have a strat­egy, we do have a plan in place to al­low us to op­er­ate.”</p>
    <p>Si­mon, who took over as the CEO in 2015, said the plans – which he did not elab­o­rate in de­tail – would evolve over the rest of the year but they have en­sured that the body would sur­vive the eco­nomic crisis.</p>
    <p>“And from a good news stand­point, our tour­na­ments seem to be strong and stable as well, and are weath­er­ing it,” he added.</p>
    <p>“You never know where you might lose one. But it ap­pears that most of our cal­en­dar will stay in­tact if the con­di­tions al­low for sport­ing events to be held go­ing for­ward.”</p>
    <p>World No. 2 Si­mona Halep will not fea­ture in the Palermo event, say­ing yes­ter­day she was with­draw­ing fol­low­ing Italy’s de­ci­sion to im­pose a manda­tory quar­an­tine for peo­ple com­ing from Ro­ma­nia and Bul­garia.</p>
    <p>“Given the re­cent rise in Covid-19 cases in Ro­ma­nia and my anx­i­eties around in­ter­na­tional air travel at this time, I have made the tough de­ci­sion to with­draw from Palermo,” the Wim­ble­don cham­pion from Ro­ma­nia said on Twit­ter.</p>
    <p>China fea­tured promi­nently in the pro­vi­sional cal­en­dar for the re­main­der of the year, with seven tour­na­ments, in­clud­ing the US$14 mil­lion (S$19.4 mil­lion) sea­son-end­ing WTA Fi­nals in Shen­zhen.</p>
    <p>Si­mon said last week that the Chi­nese city’s in­vest­ment in ten­nis in­fra­struc­ture and the Tour would amount to more than US$1 bil­lion.</p>
    <p>With some 200,000 new Covid-19 cases be­ing re­ported glob­ally ev­ery day and in­ter­na­tional travel re­stric­tions still in place, he said plans were chang­ing on an hourly ba­sis and vis­i­bil­ity for the rest of the year re­mained clouded.</p>
    <p>“I don’t think that we will be back to what we used to take as ‘nor­malcy’ prob­a­bly un­til 2022,” he said.</p>
    <p>“So we’re now also look­ing at how are we go­ing to man­age 2021, be­cause I don’t think this goes away as of Jan­uary.</p>
    <p>“There’s a tremen­dous amount of plan­ning and scenarios go­ing in as to what that year might look like.</p>
    <p>“You don’t want to lose your spon­sors, you don’t want to lose your broad­cast part­ners, you have to try to work within this new en­vi­ron­ment in as safe as you can.”</p>
    <p>How­ever, he also warned that the WTA Tour will not hes­i­tate to shut down again if there are health risks.</p>
    <p>He said: “If we find that we can­not man­age it or have too many ill­nesses and we can’t get the ath­letes to travel, we’re not go­ing to move for­ward for the sake of mov­ing for­ward, it’s got to work.”</p>
    <p>TOUGH TIMES AHEAD</p>
    <p>So we’re now also look­ing at how are we go­ing to man­age 2021, be­cause I don’t think this goes away as of Jan­uary. There’s a tremen­dous amount of plan­ning and scenarios go­ing in as to what that year might look like.</p>
