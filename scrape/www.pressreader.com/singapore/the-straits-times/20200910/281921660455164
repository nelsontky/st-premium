    <p>•</p>
    <p>WASH­ING­TON United States Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump has said he may have to dip into his own pocket to fi­nance a re-elec­tion cam­paign strug­gling to at­tract donors and vot­ers alike with only eight weeks to go.</p>
    <p>The ac­knowl­edge­ment that his once vaunted fund-rais­ing ma­chine may need help from his real es­tate for­tune un­der­lined the ob­sta­cles fac­ing the Repub­li­can as he set off on a tour of five swing states vi­tal to rack­ing up even a nar­row elec­toral col­lege vic­tory on Nov 3.</p>
    <p>“If I have to, I will,” Mr Trump told re­porters when asked about spend­ing his own cash. “What­ever it takes. We have to win.”</p>
    <p>Since the start of last year, Mr Trump’s cam­paign has spent some US$800 mil­lion (S$1.1 bil­lion), more than twice as much as that of Demo­crat Joe Bi­den.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump flew to Jupiter, Florida, for a speech with sup­port­ers in the must-win state be­fore get­ting back</p>
    <p>on Air Force One to speak in North Carolina – a swing state that went his way in 2016 but threat­ens to flip to his ri­val, Mr Bi­den.</p>
    <p>To­mor­row, Mr Trump and Mr Bi­den will both be in Penn­syl­va­nia – an­other elec­toral bat­tle­ground – for 9/11 com­mem­o­ra­tions at the Flight 93 Na­tional Memo­rial, in Shanksvill­e.</p>
    <p>It was not clear whether they might de­clare a brief truce and ap­pear jointly at the cer­e­mony re­mem­ber­ing the pas­sen­gers who died af­ter at­tack­ing their hi­jack­ers on Sept 11, 2001, send­ing the doomed plane into a field.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump is tout­ing prom­ises of</p>
    <p>a quick coro­n­avirus vac­cine – pos­si­bly right be­fore polling day – and a boom­ing eco­nomic re­cov­ery in hopes of right­ing his cam­paign.</p>
    <p>But Mr Bi­den, who is ham­mer­ing at Mr Trump’s han­dling of the coro­n­avirus pan­demic, main­tains a healthy lead in na­tional polls and much smaller but con­sis­tent ad­van­tages in the swing states.</p>
    <p>In re­sponse, Mr Trump has thrown ev­ery­thing he can at Mr Bi­den in the last cou­ple of weeks, call­ing him “stupid,” ac­cus­ing him of be­ing a pup­pet of so­cial­ist rev­o­lu­tion­ar­ies, and claim­ing that some­times vi­o­lent anti-racism protests are a har­bin­ger of Demo­cratic-led</p>
    <p>mass chaos.</p>
    <p>“Suburban vot­ers are pour­ing into the Repub­li­can Party be­cause of the vi­o­lence in Demo­crat-run cities and states. If Bi­den gets in, this vi­o­lence is ‘com­ing to the Suburbs’, and FAST,” Mr Trump tweeted Tues­day, re­peat­ing what has be­come one of his core re-elec­tion mes­sages.</p>
    <p>He also es­ca­lated his ef­forts to make China a cen­tral theme of the pres­i­den­tial race, ac­cus­ing Mr Bi­den of be­ing a “glob­al­ist sell­out” who helped en­gi­neer the wide­spread loss of Amer­i­can jobs. “Joe Bi­den’s agenda is made in China. My agenda is made in the USA,” Mr Trump said while speak­ing to thou­sands of sup­port­ers in North Carolina.</p>
    <p>Mr Bi­den, in turn, has crit­i­cised Mr Trump for pun­ish­ing US farm­ers and other in­dus­tries with harm­ful tar­iffs on Chi­nese goods. The for­mer vice-pres­i­dent has also blasted Mr Trump’s trade deal with China as not de­liv­er­ing the ben­e­fits the pres­i­dent promised.</p>
    <p>At the North Carolina rally, Mr Trump said it would be an “in­sult” if Se­na­tor Ka­mala Har­ris be­came the first wo­man to be elected pres­i­dent, re­peat­edly mock­ing the Demo­cratic vice-pres­i­den­tial nom­i­nee.</p>
    <p>“Peo­ple don’t like her,” Mr Trump said af­ter re­count­ing her slide in polls while she was run­ning for the Demo­cratic nom­i­na­tion for pres­i­dent last year. “No­body likes her,” he said. “She could never be the first wo­man pres­i­dent. That would be an in­sult to our coun­try.”</p>
    <p>Ms Har­ris, Cal­i­for­nia’s ju­nior se­na­tor and a for­mer at­tor­ney-gen­eral of that state, is the first black and In­dian-Amer­i­can wo­man on a ma­jor pres­i­den­tial party ticket.</p>
