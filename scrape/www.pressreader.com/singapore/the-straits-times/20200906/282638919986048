    <p>Look­ing back at travel pre-Covid-19 is like look­ing into another age when peo­ple could take planes, clam­ber onto trains and jos­tle in mar­kets.</p>
    <p>These ex­pe­ri­ences now feel some­what for­eign, but who would have known the dis­tor­tion a world grap­pling with Covid-19 would have faced when I vis­ited In­dia one sum­mer?</p>
    <p>We reached Varanasi close to noon, af­ter an overnight train ride from central In­dia. Drawn here by the myth­i­cal na­ture of the city and the famed Ganges River, we planned to spend a week­end in Varanasi in the north­ern In­dian state of Ut­tar Pradesh. Leav­ing the train sta­tion in the swel­ter­ing sum­mer heat of 46 deg C and en­ter­ing the ser­pen­tine al­leys, one could just de­tect the whiff of burn­ing em­bers in the air.</p>
    <p>To the Hindu pil­grim, the Ganges is one of the holi­est sites in the world and a dip inside of­fers the prospect of ab­so­lu­tion from sins. To the for­eign trav­eller, it of­fers a glimpse of some of the most in­ti­mate rit­u­als of life and death.</p>
    <p>Head­ing out for lunch, we found a lo­cal stall tucked neatly at the in­ter­sec­tion of two al­leys and sat down to en­joy some lovely chole bha­ture, a dish orig­i­nat­ing from North­ern In­dia com­bin­ing spicy chick­peas with fried bread.</p>
    <p>Within mo­ments, l oud chants and the sounds of shuf­fling feet em­anated from the start of the nar­row al­ley­way. As the sounds in­creased in in­ten­sity, we caught a glimpse of four pall­bear­ers bear­ing a body draped in colour­ful cloth and fresh flow­ers, ac­com­pa­nied by a pro­ces­sion of griev­ing men and women.</p>
    <p>The chants soon faded into the dis­tance as the pro­ces­sion snaked its way to­wards Manikarnik­a Ghat. Ghat refers to the river­front steps lead­ing to the Ganges for tak­ing holy baths.</p>
    <p>This is the largest cre­ma­tion ghat in Varanasi, with cre­ma­tions tak­ing place round the clock and num­bers com­monly ex­ceed­ing 300 on any given day.</p>
    <p>Soon af­ter, we heard the same fa­mil­iar chants fol­lowed by the rustling of feet. Another pro­ces­sion with a body was on its way to Manikarnik­a. And another. And another.</p>
    <p>The flow of pro­ces­sions did not cease and, from time to time, the chants would echo in the dis­tance, giv­ing us a lit­tle ad­vance warn­ing to shuf­fle to the sides of the al­ready nar­row al­ley to al­low the pall­bear­ers to squeeze past our shoul­ders as we re­turned to our guest­house.</p>
    <p>Dawn the next day of­fered a wel­come respite from the in­tense heat of the pre­vi­ous day. Get­ting into a lit­tle row­boat, we be­gan to drift down the great Ganges start­ing from Scin­dia Ghat.</p>
    <p>Though it was only five in the morn­ing, the pi­ous were up early, in quiet med­i­ta­tion and silent prayer. A num­ber of pil­grims were tak­ing a bath in the Ganges.</p>
    <p>Hin­dus be­lieve that a bath in the Ganges pro­vides pu­rifi­ca­tion and re­lease from sins com­mit­ted not only in the cur­rent life­time, but also ac­cu­mu­lated sins from past life­times.</p>
    <p>As we con­tin­ued to cruise down the river, we passed Manikarnik­a Ghat, the des­ti­na­tion of many pro­ces­sions we saw yes­ter­day. From afar on our row­boat, we could make out ashes and the orange glow aris­ing from i ndi­vid­ual pyres, each ablaze with bod­ies i n be­tween stacks of wood.</p>
    <p>All around the burn­ing ghat, ev­ery­thing ap­peared to be placed in a hap­haz­ard fash­ion, with wood and cloth be­ing strewn all over and rel­a­tives of the de­ceased milling around while wait­ing for the body to be burned.</p>
    <p>To the Hin­dus, dying, be­ing cre­mated and then hav­ing their ashes thrown into the Ganges present the op­por­tu­nity to es­cape the end­less cycle of life and death and achieve in­stant mok­sha, or lib­er­a­tion.</p>
    <p>As we con­tin­ued down the Ganges, we caught sight of a full form of a half-black de­com­posed body float­ing on the sur­face of the river.</p>
    <p>Cre­ma­tion is also a ques­tion of eco­nomics as not all fam­i­lies are able to af­ford the cost of the ap­prox­i­mately 300kg of wood re­quired to burn a body com­pletely, re­sult­ing in some half-burnt bod­ies placed in the Ganges.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to Hindu scrip­tures, con­cern­ing the ori­gins of the Ganges, the god­dess Ganga de­scended from heaven and made her way down from the Hi­malayas and then on to Varanasi.</p>
    <p>Since Ganga de­scended from heaven to earth, she is also the ve­hi­cle of as­cent from earth to heaven and, con­se­quently, is a tirtha, or crossing point of all be­ings, the liv­ing as well as the dead.</p>
    <p>What re­ally in­trigued me at this point was that for a place of such es­teemed ho­li­ness, the Ganges is not spared the filth seen in the al­leys. Here, the more mun­dane and phys­i­cal re­al­i­ties lie in stark jux­ta­po­si­tion to Varanasi’s dis­tinc­tion of be­ing In­dia’s holi­est city.</p>
    <p>As we con­tin­ued cruis­ing, barely 200m down­stream from where we spot­ted the float­ing body, there were three peo­ple wash­ing a huge bun­dle of white linen.</p>
    <p>“What’s that? Laun­dry?” I asked the boat­men.</p>
    <p>“Yes, for the ho­tels,” came the al­most non­cha­lant re­ply.</p>
    <p>I gulped and just hoped that ours was not one of them.</p>
    <p>As we turned around and be­gan the re­turn trip up the Ganges, there was a hive of ac­tiv­ity at one par­tic­u­lar ghat.</p>
    <p>A large crowd had gath­ered on the banks, clap­ping and cheer­ing en­thu­si­as­ti­cally as fren­zied chil­dren swam as fast as they could to shore.</p>
    <p>On closer ob­ser­va­tion, there was a man in the crowd with a loud hailer, a whis­tle and a clip­board which he used to reg­is­ter par­tic­i­pants and note down win­ners.</p>
    <p>This was a chil­dren’s swim­ming com­pe­ti­tion.</p>
    <p>For one of the holi­est places in Hin­duism, this ever-present jux­ta­po­si­tion be­tween the spir­i­tual and the phys­i­cal realms left me per­plexed and even un­com­fort­able at times. Per­haps any­where else in the world, death is treated with ap­pre­hen­sion and rev­er­ence, and of­ten kept at arm’s length.</p>
    <p>So much so that to me, an out­sider, the im­age of a chil­dren’s swim­ming com­pe­ti­tion just down­stream of where bod­ies were be­ing cre­mated and ho­tel staff were wash­ing dirty linen in the holi­est river in Hin­duism ap­peared some­what sac­ri­le­gious, and even pre­pos­ter­ous.</p>
    <p>The so­ci­ol­ogy of re­li­gion di­chotomises be­tween the sa­cred and the pro­fane, with the Ro­ma­nian historian of re­li­gion Mircea Eli­ade putting forth the con­cept of re­li­gions sep­a­rat­ing phys­i­cal space and time along the spir­i­tual lines of the sa­cred and the pro­fane.</p>
    <p>Un­like the phys­i­cal con­straints of the pro­fane realm, where be­hav­iour is largely un­governed and man is free to do as he pleases, in con­trast, the sites of the sa­cred de­mand a pos­ture of rev­er­ence and ven­er­a­tion to which the pi­ous con­form them­selves to.</p>
    <p>How­ever, here in Varanasi, there is no di­vorce be­tween the sa­cred and the pro­fane with these two spheres com­bin­ing in an un­com­fort­able amal­ga­ma­tion. What then can one make of these seem­ing con­tra­dic­tions?</p>
    <p>Per­haps they ap­pear para­dox­i­cal only to out­siders, for reli­gious faith may en­able peo­ple to bring to­gether seem­ingly an­ti­thet­i­cal spheres. Para­dox­i­cally, it is pre­cisely this un­easy jux­ta­po­si­tion of the pro­fane in its jar­ring dis­play of hu­man mor­tal­ity and the sa­cred that in­creases our aware­ness of the sa­cred.</p>
    <p>Ul­ti­mately, per­haps, to many pil­grims, these two clash­ing spheres in the cor­po­real world have no bear­ing on the ethe­real, where death in the Ganges is merely a pre­lude rather than a con­clu­sion.</p>
    <p>Varanasi, in its raw­ness, has the abil­ity to leave some of its vis­i­tors re­pulsed and taken aback. Be­yond the overt vis­i­bil­ity of death’s most in­ti­mate rit­u­als and the con­stant re­minder of man’s mor­tal­ity, this unique shar­ing of com­mon space chal­lenges the pre­vail­ing di­chotomy in our minds and leaves us with much to con­tem­plate, es­pe­cially dur­ing the pan­demic.</p>
