    <p>Malaysia’s largest rul­ing party Umno threat­ened yesterday to pull out of Prime Min­is­ter Muhyid­din Yassin’s gov­ern­ment, just hours af­ter op­po­si­tion leader An­war Ibrahim claimed a par­lia­men­tary ma­jor­ity.</p>
    <p>Should Umno, which ruled Malaysia from in­de­pen­dence up to its shock de­feat in 2018, carry out its threat, it would col­lapse the Muhyid­din ad­min­is­tra­tion which was sworn in only in March.</p>
    <p>Umno in­for­ma­tion chief Ah­mad Maslan said late yesterday that the party’s top lead­er­ship was mulling over a with­drawal from the Perikatan Na­sional (PN) gov­ern­ment fol­low­ing a meet­ing chaired by Umno pres­i­dent Ah­mad Zahid Hamidi, spec­u­lated to be among those sup­port­ing Datuk Seri An­war’s bid to top­ple Tan Sri Muhyid­din.</p>
    <p>“Umno is con­sid­er­ing with­draw­ing sup­port for PN and will pre­sent new con­di­tions... to con­tinue the po­lit­i­cal co­op­er­a­tion via a writ­ten agree­ment to be ex­e­cuted as soon as pos­si­ble,” said Datuk Seri Ah­mad Maslan.</p>
    <p>He added that Umno will push for Muafakat Na­sional, a pro-MalayMus­lim pact it spear­heads along with Parti Is­lam SeMalaysia, to be reg­is­tered as a for­mal po­lit­i­cal al­liance.</p>
    <p>Umno and Mr Muhyid­din’s Parti Pribumi Ber­satu Malaysia have been at log­ger­heads for months over pri­macy in the rul­ing pact.</p>
    <p>Tensions boiled over most re­cently af­ter Ber­satu gained the chief min­is­ter­ship of Sabah fol­low­ing the Sept 26 state polls, with se­nior fig­ures in Umno ques­tion­ing the wis­dom of their co­op­er­a­tion with Ber­satu.</p>
    <p>PN in its reg­is­tered form is led by Ber­satu pres­i­dent Mr Muhyid­din, but Umno has re­sisted joining the of­fi­cial coali­tion amid heated ne­go­ti­a­tions over seats ahead of the gen­eral elec­tion ex­pected within months.</p>
    <p>The pres­i­dent of Parti Kead­i­lan Rakyat, Mr An­war, has in­sisted that he has sup­port of more than 120 MPs in the 222-strong Par­lia­ment af­ter an au­di­ence with the King early yesterday.</p>
    <p>It is un­der­stood that po­ten­tial de­fec­tors from the Muhyid­din ad­min­is­tra­tion – which has just 113 MPs – were largely from Umno in­clud­ing those loyal to its pres­i­dent Zahid.</p>
    <p>Should Umno – which has 39 MPs – turn its back on Mr Muhyid­din, he would cease to con­trol Par­lia­ment. But it re­mains to be seen if enough law­mak­ers from the once dom­i­nant party would en­dorse Mr An­war as premier.</p>
    <p>It is un­likely that snap polls ahead of the par­lia­men­tary term’s ex­piry in 2023 would be called, given the resur­gent wave of coro­n­avirus in­fec­tions that saw 660 new cases yesterday.</p>
    <p>Mr An­war, who leads the main op­po­si­tion al­liance Pakatan Hara­pan, said that Malaysia’s King, Sul­tan Ab­dul­lah Ri’ay­atud­din, is set to meet po­lit­i­cal lead­ers to as­cer­tain who con­trols Par­lia­ment.</p>
    <p>Umno is con­sid­er­ing with­draw­ing sup­port for Perikatan Na­sional and will pre­sent new con­di­tions... to con­tinue the po­lit­i­cal co­op­er­a­tion via a writ­ten agree­ment to be ex­e­cuted as soon as pos­si­ble.</p>
    <p>DATUK SERI AH­MAD MASLAN, Umno’s in­for­ma­tion chief.</p>
