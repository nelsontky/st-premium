    <p>For about 20 years, Mr Jumo Tay flew as a pi­lot with the Repub­lic of Sin­ga­pore Air Force and in the past decade, with Jet­star Asia as a com­mer­cial pi­lot.</p>
    <p>But the 51-year-old has been grounded since March 10, af­ter de­mand for air travel plum­meted amid the Covid-19 pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Since April, he has been keep­ing him­self busy lead­ing Jet­star Asia staff in set­ting up Covid-19 swab test sites in dor­mi­to­ries. He did so well, he was re­cently pro­moted by the Man­power Min­istry to the role of ground com­man­der of in­ter­a­gency swab op­er­a­tions.</p>
    <p>He now over­sees about 15 teams, each with five mem­bers from dif­fer­ent pro­fes­sions.</p>
    <p>Mr Tay is among more than 300 Jet­star Asia cabin crew and pi­lots who are tem­po­rar­ily em­ployed by other or­gan­i­sa­tions as they await the re­cov­ery of air travel.</p>
    <p>The air­line had in June an­nounced cost-cut­ting mea­sures, which in­cluded the trim­ming of around 180 jobs. The bud­get car­rier cur­rently has more than 400 cabin crew and pi­lots in to­tal, with about 50 still fly­ing.</p>
    <p>Mr Tay’s job is to en­sure that the swab op­er­a­tions are done safely and ef­fi­ciently. “I have been able to adapt and use my skills such as plan­ning and im­ple­ment­ing large-scale op­er­a­tions,” he said.</p>
    <p>When set­ting up test­ing sites, he takes into con­sid­er­a­tion wind di­rec­tion. Queues are then or­gan­ised in a way that re­duces the risk of wind car­ry­ing droplets from those be­ing tested to oth­ers wait­ing.</p>
    <p>He works with var­i­ous stake­hold­ers such as health of­fi­cials to im­ple­ment the mea­sures.</p>
    <p>Mr Tay said: “When I am fly­ing, I prob­a­bly have a little bit more time to think and some­times I get to en­joy the scenery.</p>
    <p>“But I would say this job is very en­rich­ing and hum­bling... It is a role in the front line fight­ing against the spread of Covid-19.”</p>
    <p>He de­clined to re­veal the im­pact of the coro­n­avirus on his pi­lot’s wages ex­cept to say his wife and three daugh­ters – aged 13, 15 and 17 – were liv­ing “very com­fort­ably” when he was fly­ing full-time.</p>
    <p>“When my chil­dren heard that my pay was to be cut, they cut down on their air-con us­age... They knew that they needed to start sav­ing and help their daddy re­duce what­ever costs they can,” he said.</p>
    <p>Jet­star Asia said most of its staff remain on fur­lough leave, but are re­ceiv­ing sus­te­nance pay.</p>
    <p>Crew mem­bers who have found tem­po­rary jobs said while their in­come has been af­fected, they have been able to get by and also con­trib­ute in mean­ing­ful ways.</p>
    <p>Air stew­ardess Payal Bhan­dari, 50, who has flown with dif­fer­ent air­lines in the past 30 years, has been work­ing as a safe dis­tanc­ing am­bas­sador with the Na­tional Parks Board since June.</p>
    <p>She starts at 5.30am and takes a break at about 10am, be­fore re­port­ing for work again in the evening.</p>
    <p>Ms Payal said: “It was dif­fi­cult to adapt as we are used to be­ing in an air­craft. Work­ing out­side, it can get hot, hu­mid or rainy.</p>
    <p>“But I started to en­joy it. I like be­ing out­doors in na­ture, be­ing able to con­trib­ute, and we also get to ex­er­cise while we are walk­ing. Many peo­ple also come and thank us.”</p>
    <p>Per­ma­nent res­i­dent Gau­rani Sarah Grace Jaleco, 28, has been work­ing as a Covid-19 swab­ber.</p>
    <p>She and sev­eral of her air­crew col­leagues have also taken ad­van­tage of the re­duced flight time to start their own busi­nesses.</p>
    <p>Ms Sarah Grace has been making beeswax wraps to sell.</p>
    <p>Her cabin crew col­leagues – Mr Hosni Hanapi, 31, and Ms Ng Mui Kien, 45 – each started a food and bev­er­age busi­ness.</p>
    <p>All five Jet­star Asia staff said they are look­ing for­ward to fly­ing again.</p>
    <p>Ms Payal said: “I want to go back to fly­ing; that is all I know. I love my pas­sen­gers. I would love for the skies to open up, for trav­ellers to come back again, and to close the doors for the plane to fly again.”</p>
    <p>Above, right: Jet­star Asia air stew­ardess Payal Bhan­dari has been work­ing as a safe dis­tanc­ing am­bas­sador with the Na­tional Parks Board since June. Though both en­joy their cur­rent work, they are look­ing for­ward to fly­ing again.</p>
    <p>Toh Ting Wei</p>
    <p>If you op­er­ate an air­craft whose wheels are over for­eign ter­ri­tory within 14 sec­onds of leav­ing your home air­port, your sur­vival is likely to de­pend on open and un­fet­tered access to global mar­kets.</p>
    <p>Alas, that is the fate of Sin­ga­pore Air­lines (SIA). The Covid-19 pan­demic has been a per­fect storm for an air­line so highly de­pen­dent on open bor­ders and de­mand for air travel.</p>
    <p>With bor­ders closed, coun­tries go­ing into lock­downs and trav­ellers hun­kered down at home, the air­line group’s pas­sen­ger car­riage has plunged by 99.5 per cent.</p>
    <p>The SIA group car­ried just 38,000 pas­sen­gers in the three months to June 30, com­pared with 9.4 mil­lion a year ear­lier.</p>
    <p>Although its cargo side saw an im­prove­ment due to strong de­mand for movement of per­sonal pro­tec­tive equip­ment, phar­ma­ceu­ti­cals and fresh foods, rev­enue de­clined by $3.25 bil­lion or 79 per cent year on year to $851 mil­lion dur­ing the quar­ter.</p>
    <p>That led to an un­prece­dented loss of $1.1 bil­lion for its first quar­ter, com­pared with a profit of $111 mil­lion a year ear­lier. So much for the fi­nan­cial num­bers.</p>
    <p>The good news is that the April-June quar­ter is likely to have been its worst. But the bad news is that things are un­likely to im­prove sig­nif­i­cantly any time soon – at least not un­til a re­li­able vac­cine is found and widely de­ployed.</p>
    <p>The In­ter­na­tional Air Trans­port As­so­ci­a­tion – cit­ing poor virus con­tain­ment around the world, de­pressed busi­ness travel and lack of con­sumer con­fi­dence – does not ex­pect air travel to re­turn to</p>
