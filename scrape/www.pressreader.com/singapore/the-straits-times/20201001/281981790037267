    <p>In a sig­nal of greater in­clu­sive­ness, the Emerg­ing Stronger Con­ver­sa­tions (ESC), held in English so far, will soon also be con­ducted in Man­darin, Malay and Tamil. Ef­forts will also be made to in­volve per­sons with dis­abil­i­ties. This comes on the back of calls for greater rep­re­sen­ta­tion from women, mi­nori­ties and vul­ner­a­ble com­mu­ni­ties on the 17-mem­ber Emerg­ing Stronger Task­force, which was set up ear­lier this year to tackle the longer-term eco­nomic im­pact of the Covid-19 pan­demic. Taken to­gether un­der the Sin­ga­pore To­gether move­ment, the ESC and the task force seek to chart the so­cial and eco­nomic fu­ture of post-pan­demic Sin­ga­pore, by com­ing up with ideas and so­lu­tions to­gether with Sin­ga­pore­ans.</p>
    <p>There have been 11 vir­tual ESC ses­sions and on­line sur­veys on two apps, with more to come. More than 1,000 Sin­ga­pore­ans have par­tic­i­pated so far. Key is­sues raised re­late largely to jobs and the econ­omy. Many called for fair op­por­tu­ni­ties for lo­cals to be groomed for se­nior po­si­tions, more sup­port for en­trepreneur­s and small and medium-sized en­ter­prises, and work­ing from home to be in­sti­tu­tion­alised. Oth­ers spoke of val­ues, not just dol­lars and cents: of Sin­ga­pore­ans be­com­ing more ac­tive and responsibl­e in pol­icy de­bates and co-creat­ing so­lu­tions; a kinder so­ci­ety that is more open to di­verse views, es­pe­cially on con­tro­ver­sial is­sues; and the need to bridge the dig­i­tal divide, and pro­vide the less well-off with more dig­i­tal and so­cial re­sources. On the eco­nomic front, in­dus­try-led coali­tions have been set up in seven key growth ar­eas. Th­ese Sin­ga­pore To­gether Al­liances for Ac­tion, which are part­ner­ships be­tween in­dus­try play­ers and the Gov­ern­ment, will pro­to­type new ideas to grow the econ­omy and cre­ate jobs.</p>
    <p>The task force aims to share its pre­lim­i­nary rec­om­men­da­tions by early next year. Mean­while, the ESC will tran­si­tion from broad-based con­ver­sa­tions to deeper ones on spe­cific is­sues that are con­ducted by the re­spec­tive gov­ern­ment agen­cies. But the evolv­ing cri­sis could throw up some sur­prises yet. Hence, if the work of the ESC and task force is to re­main rel­e­vant and up to date, it should not end with a one-off re­port. In­stead, is­sues – es­pe­cially press­ing ones – should be ad­dressed as soon as they emerge. A case in point is the cit­i­zens’ jury on the war on di­a­betes in 2017. Par­tic­i­pants did not just pro­vide feed­back, but worked with one an­other to come up with rec­om­men­da­tions and test-bed so­lu­tions. Sim­i­larly, coun­tries from Canada to Ire­land have formed cit­i­zens’ as­sem­blies to tackle dif­fi­cult is­sues rang­ing from abor­tion to cli­mate change. Amid grow­ing pressure around the world for more in­clu­sive pol­i­tics and ef­fec­tive gov­er­nance, one sil­ver lin­ing of the pan­demic may be that it has opened such a win­dow for deep and last­ing change, in col­lab­o­ra­tion with cit­i­zens from all walks of life.</p>
