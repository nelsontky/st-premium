    <p>A lawyer was sen­tenced to 21 months’ jail yes­ter­day for con­sum­ing metham­phetamine, or Ice. He was caught in pos­ses­sion of the drug at Wood­lands Check­point in March 2018.</p>
    <p>Mark Tan Teik Yu, 42, had pleaded guilty in a dis­trict court on Aug 17 this year to one count of meth con­sump­tion.</p>
    <p>He had also ad­mit­ted to be­ing in pos­ses­sion of meth, var­i­ous drug para­pher­na­lia, as well as nimetazepa­m, or Erimin-5, tablets.</p>
    <p>Dis­trict Judge Jasven­der Kaur said she took into con­sid­er­a­tion sev­eral mit­i­gat­ing fac­tors, in­clud­ing psy­cho­log­i­cal as­sess­ments in­di­cat­ing that Tan was suf­fer­ing from ma­jor de­pres­sive disor­der.</p>
    <p>This men­tal health con­di­tion was fur­ther ag­gra­vated by high lev­els of stress due to his fi­nan­cial sit­u­a­tion, and be­ing fired from the law firm where he worked.</p>
    <p>Tan’s de­pres­sion then wors­ened when he dis­cov­ered that his then wife was hav­ing an af­fair.</p>
    <p>Dis­trict Judge Kaur noted that Tan had ini­tially turned to al­co­hol for re­lief, be­fore he was in­tro­duced to meth in 2012.</p>
    <p>“The ac­cused was a high-func­tion­ing, ma­ture in­di­vid­ual be­fore his first con­tact with drugs. His con­sump­tion of metham­phetamine was an ill-judged ef­fort to stop his emo­tional spi­ral, with his ma­jor de­pres­sive disor­der making him less likely to think crit­i­cally,” she said.</p>
    <p>The court had ear­lier heard that Tan was in Malaysia on March 17, 2018, when one of his friends in Sin­ga­pore – Iman Hakiki Azhari – con­tacted him. Deputy Pub­lic Prose­cu­tors Ivan Chua and Yee Jia Rong stated in court doc­u­ments that Iman and Tan had been friends since 2010. From 2012, the pair oc­ca­sion­ally con­sumed meth and nimetazepa­m to­gether.</p>
    <p>The day that Tan was caught, Iman had texted him to ask him to buy a box of 100 Erimin-5 pills.</p>
    <p>Tan agreed to do so for $750 and bought the drugs in Malaysia from a con­tact known only as “DC”. While at DC’s home, Tan con­sumed meth, the court heard.</p>
    <p>When he ar­rived at Wood­lands Check­point at around 10.45pm, an Ae­tos se­cu­rity of­fi­cer checked his car and found a pouch con­tain­ing drug para­pher­na­lia such as a glass tube. An Im­mi­gra­tion and Check­points Author­ity (ICA) task force of­fi­cer then found drug uten­sils such as four coloured straws and a rub­ber tube, some pills con­tain­ing nimetazepa­m, and crys­talline sub­stances con­tain­ing meth.</p>
    <p>Tan’s urine sam­ple was taken and it tested pos­i­tive for meth.</p>
    <p>He claimed he had con­sumed the drug to feel “alert and awake” while driv­ing back to Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>Cen­tral Nar­cotics Bureau of­fi­cers raided Tan’s home around 6am the next day and found more crys­talline sub­stances con­tain­ing meth in a drawer of a bed­side ta­ble.</p>
    <p>Dis­trict Judge Kaur said fur­ther mit­i­gat­ing fac­tors were also taken into con­sid­er­a­tion in Tan’s sen­tenc­ing. This in­cluded the “sin­cere ef­forts” that Tan has since made in his treat­ment, in­clud­ing his ac­tive par­tic­i­pa­tion in re­cov­ery sup­port groups, and his low odds of re­of­fend­ing or re­laps­ing.</p>
    <p>The judge added that she had also taken into con­sid­er­a­tion the fact that the quan­tity of Ice that Tan pos­sessed was “rel­a­tively small”, and that the drugs were meant only for his con­sump­tion.</p>
    <p>Af­ter his sen­tenc­ing, Tan was seen crying be­fore he left the court­room and em­braced his fam­ily. He will be­gin serv­ing his jail term next Mon­day. His bail is set at $20,000.</p>
    <p>Of­fend­ers con­victed of meth con­sump­tion can be jailed for up to 10 years and fined up to $20,000.</p>
    <p>The Law So­ci­ety said it will study the charges, state­ment of facts and the mit­i­ga­tion plea ten­dered for Tan. “If there is any breach of the pro­fes­sional con­duct rules, the Law So­ci­ety will con­sider the ap­pro­pri­ate ac­tion to take.”</p>
