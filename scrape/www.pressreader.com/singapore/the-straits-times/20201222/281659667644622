    <p>The sole lo­cally trans­mit­ted Covid-19 case yes­ter­day was a Sin­ga­porean woman who tested pos­i­tive be­fore a sched­uled cruise trip, said the Min­istry of Health (MOH).</p>
    <p>The min­istry said that on Dec 14, the 39-year-old woman and her fam­ily had gone on a South­ern Is­lands tour with two other fam­i­lies, and their group had 12 peo­ple in all.</p>
    <p>This is seven more than the group of five al­lowed in phase two of Sin­ga­pore’s re­open­ing.</p>
    <p>MOH said in­ves­ti­ga­tions are on­go­ing to as­sess if there was any breach of the rel­e­vant safe man­age­ment mea­sures.</p>
    <p>The woman, who was asymp­to­matic, was taken in an am­bu­lance to the Na­tional Cen­tre for In­fec­tious Dis­eases the day af­ter her test, when it re­turned pos­i­tive for Covid-19 in­fec­tion.</p>
    <p>The Na­tional Pub­lic Health Lab­o­ra­tory has run fur­ther tests to ver­ify that the woman has Covid-19, and MOH said that her sero­log­i­cal test re­sult is pend­ing. A pos­i­tive sero­log­i­cal test in­di­cates a likely past in­fec­tion.</p>
    <p>The woman lives in Jurong West Street 93, and went to work at Ruis­ing Chem­i­cals at 18 Boon Lay Way be­fore her test re­sult was con­firmed.</p>
    <p>Epi­demi­o­log­i­cal in­ves­ti­ga­tions are in progress.</p>
    <p>In the mean­time, all her iden­ti­fied close con­tacts, in­clud­ing fam­ily mem­bers and co-work­ers, have been i so­lated and placed on quar­an­tine and will be tested at the start and end of their quar­an­tine pe­riod.</p>
    <p>MOH also an­nounced nine im­ported cases yes­ter­day, tak­ing Sin­ga­pore’s to­tal to 58,432.</p>
    <p>Of th­ese, three are Sin­ga­pore­ans who re­turned from Bri­tain and In­dia.</p>
    <p>An­other two are work per­mit hold­ers cur­rently em­ployed here who ar­rived from In­done­sia and Myan­mar.</p>
    <p>The sixth im­ported case is a stu­dent’s pass holder who ar­rived from Myan­mar.</p>
    <p>The re­main­ing three cases are short-term visit pass hold­ers who are crew mem­bers of sep­a­rate ves­sels which ar­rived from In­done­sia. They had not dis­em­barked from their ships un­til they were taken to a quar­an­tine fa­cil­ity or hos­pi­tal, said MOH.</p>
    <p>All nine im­ported cases were placed on stay-home no­tices or iso­lated on ar­rival in Sin­ga­pore, and tested while in quar­an­tine.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, MOH added sev­eral lo­ca­tions to the list of places vis­ited by in­fec­tious Covid-19 pa­tients, in­clud­ing An­chor­point Shop­ping Cen­tre, Takashimay­a in Ngee Ann City and Raf­fles City Shop­ping Cen­tre.</p>
    <p>Over­all, the num­ber of new cases in the com­mu­nity has re­mained low, with a to­tal of one case in the past week, who is cur­rently un­linked.</p>
