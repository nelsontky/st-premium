    <p>NEW YORK • Gold ex­tended its rally above the key US$2,000 an ounce level yes­ter­day, hit­ting a fresh record high as a weak­en­ing dol­lar and fall­ing re­turns on US bonds added fuel to a buy­ing spree among in­vestors look­ing for a safe store of value.</p>
    <p>With the coron­avirus pan­demic roil­ing mar­kets, gold has now surged 34.5 per cent this year and is one of 2020’s best per­form­ing as­sets.</p>
    <p>Af­ter break­ing above US$2,000 for the first time on Tues­day and hit­ting a new high of US$2,041.33 an ounce ear­lier yes­ter­day, spot gold was up 1.1 per cent at US$2,040.50 by 1020 GMT. US gold fu­tures climbed 1.8 per cent to US$2,056.30.</p>
    <p>“There’s a level of fear in the mar­kets which is al­most pal­pa­ble,” said in­de­pen­dent an­a­lyst Ross Nor­man. “Mo­men­tum is feed­ing on it­self, based upon real con­cerns about the fail­ure of the macro econ­omy to show any mean­ing­ful signs of re­cov­ery.”</p>
    <p>Sil­ver prices also surged, jump­ing 3.2 per cent to US$26.84, the high­est since April 2013. Sil­ver, which is both a safe-haven as­set and widely used in in­dus­try, has now risen 50 per cent this year, out­per­form­ing even gold.</p>
    <p>In­vestors fear that eco­nomic stim­u­lus un­leashed in re­sponse to the coron­avirus pan­demic will trig­ger in­fla­tion, de­valu­ing other as­sets, and keep bond yields his­tor­i­cally low, en­hanc­ing the ap­peal of non-yield­ing gold.</p>
    <p>In­fla­tion-ad­justed United States 10-year yields have fallen from 0.15 per cent to be­low mi­nus 1 per cent this year.</p>
    <p>As the coron­avirus has now in­fected more than 18 mil­lion peo­ple world­wide and the out­look for the global econ­omy re­mains cloudy, many an­a­lysts think gold will rally fur­ther, with Bank of Amer­ica say­ing it could reach US$3,000 over the next 18 months.</p>
    <p>The dol­lar has weak­ened to multi-year lows and fell again yes­ter­day as Wash­ing­ton re­mained dead­locked over a re­lief pack­age.</p>
    <p>The rally re­mains vul­ner­a­ble to pull­backs, said Mr Carsten Menke, an an­a­lyst at Julius Baer.</p>
    <p>“It’s clear for us that the in­sur­ance gold pro­vides to an in­vestor’s port­fo­lio has be­come very ex­pen­sive and that the mar­ket at cur­rent lev­els is suited for short-term traders rather than safe-haven seek­ers.”</p>
    <p>Tech­ni­cal an­a­lysts also warn that gold needs a pe­riod of con­sol­i­da­tion.</p>
    <p>Else­where, plat­inum rose 1.4 per cent to US$950.29 and pal­la­dium was 0.6 per cent higher at US$2,151.02.</p>
