    <p>Im­plicit bias is a fact of hu­man be­hav­iour. Un­der­stand­ing how such bias is formed al­lows us to im­prove racial har­mony ed­u­ca­tion and par­ent­ing tools to help raise chil­dren who are more in­clu­sive and sup­port­ive of di­ver­sity, says Dr Adrian Kwek, a se­nior lec­turer at the Sin­ga­pore Univer­sity of So­cial Sci­ences.</p>
    <p>July 21 is Racial Har­mony Day, a day set aside by the Min­istry of Ed­u­ca­tion since 1997 to re­mind stu­dents of the 1964 race ri­ots in Sin­ga­pore and the im­por­tance of racial har­mony for our so­ci­ety.</p>
    <p>The set­ting aside of this day is one of the many gov­ern­ment and civic ini­tia­tives over the years to pro­mote racial har­mony. They ap­pear to have ef­fect. The In­sti­tute of Pol­icy Stud­ies con­ducted a poll last year, which showed that Sin­ga­pore­ans have bet­ter at­ti­tudes to­wards races other than their own. The Min­istry of Cul­ture, Com­mu­nity and Youth’s 2019 So­cial Pulse Sur­vey yielded sim­i­lar find­ings.</p>
    <p>Yet, the un­der­ly­ing ten­sions are al­ways there. I am of­ten re­minded of it when I browse the com­ments sec­tion of the cit­i­zen jour­nal­ism web­site Stomp. When­ever an ar­ti­cle is about a per­son’s mis­be­haviour and the per­son is iden­ti­fied as some­one from a mi­nor­ity race in an ac­com­pa­ny­ing pho­to­graph, I will in­evitably come across racist com­ments.</p>
    <p>Racial bi­ases can be ex­plicit or im­plicit. While we are aware of and can con­trol our ex­pres­sions of ex­plicit bi­ases, we are nei­ther aware of, nor can we con­sciously con­trol, our im­plicit bi­ases. Im­plicit bi­ases are thus dif­fi­cult to ob­serve and re­move. In­stead they are in­ferred by psy­chol­o­gists through spe­cialised means like ques­tion­naires, ob­ser­va­tion of sub­tle be­hav­iours like blink­ing and eye con­tact, or by the Im­plicit As­so­ci­a­tion Test, which mea­sures the time taken for peo­ple to cat­e­gorise racially iden­ti­fi­able faces and pos­i­tive or neg­a­tive words.</p>
    <p>De­spite be­ing dif­fi­cult to de­tect, im­plicit bi­ases have sig­nif­i­cant bear­ing on racial har­mony in a so­ci­ety. So­cial psy­chol­o­gists have posited that they in­flu­ence our mo­ti­va­tion to rea­son about ac­tions, our per­cep­tion of whether some­one is friendly or not, and our in­ter­pre­ta­tion of oth­ers’ words and ac­tions. These can have the down­stream con­se­quences of ag­gra­vat­ing the level of sus­pi­cion and mis­un­der­stand­ing be­tween peo­ple of dif­fer­ent races in so­ci­ety.</p>
    <p>Racial bi­ases are hard­wired in young chil­dren from the time they be­come cog­ni­tively aware of other peo­ple. Stud­ies have shown tod­dlers to be bi­ased in favour of peo­ple of their own eth­nic­ity.</p>
    <p>The bias in­creases un­til school­go­ing age, and then some­thing cu­ri­ous hap­pens.</p>
    <p>Ex­plicit bias de­creases but im­plicit bias re­mains the same. Re­searchers spec­u­late that this is be­cause so­cial norms in school and so­ci­ety block stu­dents’ con­spic­u­ous con­scious ex­pres­sions of racial prej­u­dice, while their im­plicit racial bi­ases go un­der so­ci­ety’s radar.</p>
    <p>What could be done to mit­i­gate im­plicit racial bi­ases in grow­ing up? Here are five points from so­cial psy­chol­ogy that can help.</p>
    <p>IN­TRIN­SIC GOALS</p>
    <p>Ed­u­ca­tional psy­chol­o­gist Bart Duriez con­ducted a study on ado­les­cents that sug­gests parental en­cour­age­ment of in­trin­sic goals can lessen ado­les­cent racial and cul­tural bi­ases.</p>
    <p>Ex­trin­sic goals are goals aimed at ob­tain­ing con­spic­u­ous signs of suc­cess like so­cial sta­tus, good looks or wealth. In­trin­sic goals are goals aimed at ob­tain­ing per­sonal sat­is­fac­tion in as­sist­ing oth­ers, learn­ing a skill or forg­ing good re­la­tion­ships.</p>
    <p>The ba­sic idea is that ex­trin­sic goals, if pur­sued at the ex­pense of in­trin­sic goals, will lead an ado­les­cent to “ex­pe­ri­ence other peo­ple as com­peti­tors and po­ten­tial haz­ards to their own wel­fare”, re­sult­ing in low­ered em­pa­thy to­wards oth­ers, which Dr Duriez found in an­other study to cor­re­late neg­a­tively with prej­u­dice.</p>
    <p>FEEL­INGS OF SE­CU­RITY</p>
    <p>Dr Duriez’s study also sug­gests that hav­ing par­ents who sup­port feel­ings of self-ex­pres­sion and se­cu­rity re­sults in ado­les­cents hav­ing less feel­ings of ag­gres­sion against those who go against their norms. This in turn can com­ple­ment the good ef­fects of pur­su­ing in­trin­sic goals, for con­fi­dent and se­cure youth will be less likely to per­ceive out­group mem­bers as threats.</p>
    <p>INTERGROUP CON­TACT</p>
    <p>Many stud­ies sug­gest that intergroup con­tact can re­duce racial bias in the par­tic­i­pants. De­vel­op­men­tal psy­chol­o­gist</p>
    <p>Frances Aboud and her col­lab­o­ra­tors call friend­ship the “gold stan­dard for con­tact”.</p>
    <p>Other re­searchers have found that be­ing friends with some­one is usu­ally ac­com­pa­nied with re­spect­ing that per­son.</p>
    <p>Be­cause friend­ship is un­likely to de­velop as a mat­ter of in­ten­tional ped­a­gog­i­cal cul­ti­va­tion, “nat­u­ral ex­po­sures” in which in­ter­ac­tions are cho­sen by the par­tic­i­pants in a mul­tira­cial en­vi­ron­ment are of­ten more ef­fec­tive than ran­dom as­sign­ments to groups. In­ter­est­ingly, re­searchers have also found that the mere knowl­edge of intergroup friend­ships can mit­i­gate racial bias.</p>
    <p>MO­RAL REA­SON­ING</p>
    <p>Child psy­chol­o­gist Adam Rut­land and his col­leagues dis­tin­guish be­tween two types of in­ter­ests that a child has: in­ter­ests of the group to which she/he be­longs and mo­ral in­ter­ests. These in­ter­ests can con­flict be­cause the pre­scrip­tions of mo­ral prin­ci­ples like equal­ity and fair­ness can go against group norms.</p>
    <p>Chil­dren who learn how to rea­son with mo­ral prin­ci­ples that ap­ply to hu­man be­ings in gen­eral rather than to spe­cific groups can over­ride rea­son­ing based on racial stereotype­s.</p>
    <p>IN­CLU­SIVE COM­MON IDEN­TI­TIES</p>
    <p>The need to iden­tify with one’s group, to be ac­cepted by its au­thor­ity fig­ures and peers, can lead one to con­form to group norms. The group norms that con­sti­tute a group’s com­mon iden­tity is thus an im­por­tant fac­tor in influencin­g one’s at­ti­tudes to­wards peo­ple of other groups. Dr Rut­land and col­leagues posit that con­cerns about how one­self is viewed by one’s group “should lead to pos­i­tive at­ti­tudes to­wards out­groups, if (po­ten­tially in­clu­sive) mo­ral prin­ci­ples like equal­ity and fair­ness are es­sen­tial to the group iden­tity”.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to then Ed­u­ca­tion Min­is­ter Ong Ye Kung at this year’s Com­mit­tee of Sup­ply (COS) de­bates, the Min­istry of Ed­u­ca­tion’s Char­ac­ter and Cit­i­zen­ship Ed­u­ca­tion (CCE) cur­ricu­lum is un­der­go­ing re­view and changes will be rolled out from next year.</p>
    <p>What im­prove­ments to the cur­rent 2014 CCE cur­ricu­lum can re­search on im­plicit bias sug­gest?</p>
    <p>First, pri­mary school CCE should be front-loaded with skills, val­ues and at­ti­tudes rather than knowl­edge.</p>
    <p>Al­ready at Pri­mary 1 and 2, pupils should be ex­posed to teach­ing strate­gies like sto­ry­telling and putting one­self in an­other’s shoes to in­cul­cate in­clu­sive dis­po­si­tions like em­pa­thy, hu­mil­ity and re­spect for oth­ers. Early child­hood bi­ases can be mit­i­gated by such dis­po­si­tions rather than knowl­edge of cul­tural and re­li­gious prac­tices.</p>
    <p>Sec­ond, stu­dents should be taught to ne­go­ti­ate po­ten­tial con­flicts be­tween the CCE do­mains of self and com­mu­nity. Stu­dents come to school with fa­mil­ial and other group norms al­ready em­bed­ded in their sense of iden­tity. When iden­tity per­pet­u­at­ing val­ues like view­ing one­self pos­i­tively and re­spect­ing one­self are taught with­out ref­er­ence to com­mu­nity val­ues, they can pro­mote ag­gres­sive ways of pro­tect­ing one’s iden­tity.</p>
    <p>Third, the mo­ral val­ues of re­spect and fair­ness can be pow­er­fully in­cul­cated by teach­ing stu­dents to stand up against bul­ly­ing.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to Min­is­ter Ong at the COS de­bates, “our chil­dren need to learn to stand up against dis­crim­i­na­tion, against bul­ly­ing – of all kinds, and re­gard­less of whom the vic­tim is”.</p>
    <p>To the ex­tent that the re­vi­sions to the CCE cur­ricu­lum in­clude many it­er­a­tions of this les­son, their ef­fect will be the en­trench­ing of in­clu­sive mo­ral norms in stu­dents’ iden­ti­ties in op­po­si­tion to those group norms that threaten racial har­mony.</p>
    <p>Ed­u­cat­ing for racial har­mony does not write on a blank slate be­cause our brains are hard­wired with bias. The trans­fer of knowl­edge of his­tor­i­cal and cur­rent racial in­ci­dents and the dis­cus­sion of racially sen­si­tive is­sues are well com­ple­mented by deeper strate­gies like the listed ones above, that mit­i­gate im­plicit racial bias.</p>
