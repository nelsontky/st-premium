    <p>As a pop­u­lar ob­ste­tri­cian and gy­nae­col­o­gist, Dr Ann Tan is al­ways busy. The last few months of the year, how­ever, are es­pe­cially hec­tic.</p>
    <p>Asked why, she grins and replies: “New Year res­o­lu­tions? Many peo­ple say: ‘I must get preg­nant this year’ so they start from Christ­mas and Jan­uary.”</p>
    <p>Covid-19 and the cir­cuit breaker in Sin­ga­pore will prob­a­bly also mean more ex­pec­tant moth­ers in the months to come, she reck­ons.</p>
    <p>“More peo­ple are try­ing, and what we are go­ing through makes peo­ple think of life more and they want to have more kids,” she says.</p>
    <p>Dr Tan, 58, has de­liv­ered thou­sands of ba­bies over the last three decades. “I de­liver about 15 a month,” she says.</p>
    <p>Also a well-known fer­til­ity doc­tor, she has helped many cou­ples con­ceive too. In fact, she is an ad­vo­cate of so­cial freez­ing – of both eggs and sperm – which she be­lieves is es­pe­cially cru­cial in Sin­ga­pore, which has one of the low­est fer­til­ity rates in the world.</p>
    <p>The to­tal fer­til­ity rate (TFR) here is 1.14 chil­dren per fe­male in 2019, well be­low the re­place­ment level of 2.1. It is, how­ever, il­le­gal for women to freeze their eggs in Sin­ga­pore ex­cept un­der spe­cial med­i­cal cir­cum­stances, such as when they have to un­dergo chemo­ther­apy or ra­dio­ther­apy, be­cause these pro­ce­dures could dam­age their eggs.</p>
    <p>Her rea­sons for be­ing a freez­ing ad­vo­cate are sim­ple. “Sin­ga­pore’s pop­u­la­tion is go­ing the other way and our peo­ple are not go­ing to get mar­ried any ear­lier. They are just go­ing to get mar­ried later and later,” she says, cit­ing rea­sons like ca­reer, the right part­ner and cost of liv­ing.</p>
    <p>If the law re­mains in­flex­i­ble, we will con­tinue to lose the fer­til­ity years of a cou­ple, she says. “So I want eggs, good ones. And good sperm too,” she says with a gig­gle.</p>
    <p>The for­mer chief of fe­tal ma­ter­nal medicine at the De­part­ment of Ob­stet­rics and Gy­nae­col­ogy at the Sin­ga­pore Gen­eral Hos­pi­tal (SGH) and now the founder of Women Fer­til­ity & Fe­tal Cen­tre, she just wants to “help pa­tients achieve their dreams of hav­ing healthy ba­bies”.</p>
    <p>Unas­sum­ing and chatty, Dr Tan is the sec­ond of three chil­dren of a lawyer and an aca­demic. Her late mother – Sin­ga­pore’s first and only fe­male chem­istry pro­fes­sor – was orig­i­nally from Hong Kong.</p>
    <p>“My ma­ter­nal grand­fa­ther was a com­prador; he had six wives and 19 chil­dren,” she lets on.</p>
    <p>She adds: “My par­ents met on the slow boat to Lon­don. She was go­ing to study at Univer­sity Col­lege Lon­don, and he at Gray’s Inn.”</p>
    <p>Dr Tan’s grow­ing-up years were spent in the Fern­hill area, just off Stevens Road.</p>
    <p>“Mom was al­ways the top girl in school so she was al­ways nag­ging us about our stud­ies and ex­pected us to do well,” says the for­mer stu­dent of Sin­ga­pore Chi­nese Girls School, whose elder sis­ter is also a doc­tor and her younger brother, a com­puter en­gi­neer.</p>
    <p>She cer­tainly did well, clinch­ing a Pub­lic Ser­vice Com­mis­sion schol­ar­ship to study medicine at the Na­tional Univer­sity Of Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>In med­i­cal school, she tin­kered with the idea of be­com­ing a car­di­ol­o­gist but ob­stet­rics and gy­nae­col­ogy (O&G) won be­cause, in her naivete, she thought all births were happy oc­ca­sions.</p>
    <p>Her aunt, Dr W.K. Tan from Thom­son Med­i­cal, also in­spired her. The veteran gy­nae­col­o­gist – one of Sin­ga­pore’s most fa­mous – is still ex­tremely sought af­ter, and ap­par­ently de­liv­er­ing the grand­chil­dren of some of her pa­tients.</p>
    <p>Like her mother and aunt, Dr Tan is no slouch when it comes to achieve­ments.</p>
    <p>Af­ter grad­u­at­ing from NUS in 1986, she started work­ing at the Sin­ga­pore Gen­eral Hos­pi­tal. Five years later, she be­came a mem­ber of the Royal Col­lege of Ob­ste­tri­cians and Gy­nae­col­o­gists of the United King­dom and also re­ceived her Master of Medicine in Ob­stet­rics and Gy­nae­col­ogy.</p>
    <p>The first Sin­ga­porean to hold a Di­ploma in Fe­tal Medicine from the Fe­tal Medicine Foun­da­tion in Lon­don, she has also won a slew of awards in­clud­ing the Young In­ves­ti­ga­tor Award by the In­ter­na­tional So­ci­ety of Ul­tra­sound in Ob­stet­rics & Gy­nae­col­ogy in 1995.</p>
    <p>Also in 1995, she won a Health Man­power De­vel­op­ment Plan award to go on a clin­i­cal at­tach­ment for fe­tal echocar­dio­g­ra­phy – the di­ag­noses of heart con­di­tions in the foe­tus – at the pres­ti­gious Yale School of Medicine in the United States.</p>
    <p>By then mar­ried to a busi­ness­man, she says the year-long at­tach­ment was an eye-opener, ex­pos­ing her to re­search and the han­dling of crit­i­cal cases.</p>
    <p>“I’ve never seen so many ICU cases in my life,” says Dr Tan, who tended to, among oth­ers, ex­pec­tant moth­ers who were also drug ad­dicts.</p>
    <p>She came back to find her­self head­ing the fe­tal ma­ter­nal sec­tion in SGH’s O&G de­part­ment as many con­sul­tants had left.</p>
    <p>“It was a steep learn­ing curve but it was also good for me be­cause ev­ery­body was try­ing to teach me every­thing,” she says.</p>
    <p>Many high risk preg­nan­cies came her way and she re­calls de­liv­er­ing ba­bies which weighed just 500gm or with ab­nor­mal­i­ties such as lung ef­fu­sion, a con­di­tion also known as “wa­ter on the lungs”.</p>
    <p>Af­ter 15 years at SGH, she struck out on her own.</p>
    <p>There is deep sat­is­fac­tion in be­ing able to help peo­ple as a gy­nae­col­o­gist, she says.</p>
    <p>“When you help some­one over­come un­cer­tain­ties and lead them to a happy out­come, it’s re­ally nice, such a good thing.”</p>
    <p>But it can be ex­tremely trau­matic and dif­fi­cult when the preg­nancy is high risk and dif­fi­cult.</p>
    <p>Can­didly, she ad­mits to some­times get­ting emo­tion­ally af­fected.</p>
    <p>“It can be re­ally bad but I can’t show it. It can get quite schiz­o­phrenic ev­ery day. With one pa­tient, it’s ‘Oh, you just got preg­nant. I’m so happy for you.’ And the next one: ‘I’m so sorry, but your baby has an ab­nor­mal­ity or you just had a mis­car­riage,’” says Dr Tan, who was the first to in­tro­duce the First Trimester Preg­nancy Screen­ing in Sin­ga­pore in 2003. The screen­ing gauges the risk of the foe­tus hav­ing Down syn­drome or other birth de­fects.</p>
    <p>De­spite her years on the j ob, break­ing bad news – of ab­nor­mal­i­ties, dif­fi­cul­ties, mis­car­riages – does not get eas­ier.</p>
    <p>“It can be very painful,” she says. Be­cause she has gone on such in­ti­mate and per­sonal jour­neys – in­volv­ing joy, grief and ev­ery emo­tion in-be­tween – with her pa­tients, many of them have be­come good friends. The walls in her of­fice are plas­tered with pho­tos and Thank You cards from women and cou­ples whom she has helped to be­come par­ents.</p>
    <p>See­ing the pain many women go through has led her to be­come an ad­vo­cate for so­cial egg freez­ing. A wo­man, she says, is at her most fer­tile in her late teens and 20s, af­ter which her fer­til­ity and the qual­ity of her eggs start to de­cline</p>
    <p>“At 40, your chance of get­ting a nor­mal egg is one to two in 10. At 45, it is closer to one in 15 or 20. By the time you’re 50, it’s go­ing to be very hard,” says the mother of three chil­dren aged be­tween 20 and 26.</p>
    <p>It wor­ries her that she is also see­ing an in­creas­ing num­ber of young women – some in their late 20s – with egg banks that are equiv­a­lent to a 40 year old’s.</p>
    <p>“But they may not be in a fi­nan­cial po­si­tion to get mar­ried, or they haven’t found the right part­ner, so how?”</p>
    <p>“You can­not change the fact that women are get­ting mar­ried later, and have to push their fer­til­ity wishes later. What I’m say­ing is, just give them the op­tion, l et them choose.”</p>
    <p>She is only too fa­mil­iar with the pain many women feel about their in­abil­ity to con­ceive.</p>
    <p>“Some are high up in their ca­reer, they do very well. They can con­trol ev­ery­body and every­thing in their life but they can’t con­trol their fer­til­ity. It re­ally drives them a bit batty,”</p>
    <p>While she un­der­stands that Sin­ga­pore’s pol­icy on egg freez­ing is in place to de­ter is­sues like sin­gle moth­er­hood, she be­lieves women should have the right to safe­guard their abil­ity to be­come moth­ers of healthy ba­bies later in life.</p>
    <p>Right now, l ocal women go abroad to freeze their eggs. For in­stance, Sin­ga­porean ac­tress Ase Wang, 38, re­vealed in an in­ter­view two years ago that she had her eggs frozen i n Bangkok be­cause she wanted to keep her op­tions open and em­brace moth­er­hood when she was ready.</p>
    <p>“I’m sure that if they had a choice, many of these women would have pre­ferred to have their eggs frozen in Sin­ga­pore be­cause they trust the sys­tem here.”</p>
    <p>Egg freez­ing is a con­ver­sa­tion which needs to take place, she says.</p>
    <p>Talk­ing about it, she be­lieves, could lead women to think more about their fer­til­ity. Many, for in­stance, do not know that pro­ce­dures to re­move cysts and fi­broids in their wombs could af­fect their egg bank.</p>
    <p>“Talk­ing about it may prompt a wo­man to check her egg bank and de­cide to have chil­dren now to avoid un­nec­es­sary risks and com­pli­ca­tions later in life,” she says.</p>
    <p>Lest men think it does not con­cern them, Dr Tan says the qual­ity of a man’s sperm de­clines with age too.</p>
    <p>Stud­ies have shown links be­tween older fa­thers and autism in chil­dren, she says.</p>
    <p>“I re­ally need peo­ple to un­der­stand I push this from a place of the pain I feel for pa­tients. Fer­til­ity should be per­sonal and in­formed,” she says sim­ply.</p>
    <p>Dr Tan – who serves on the board of the Health Pro­mo­tion Board’s Women’s Health Com­mit­tee – is also com­mit­ted to so­cial work.</p>
    <p>A for­mer pres­i­dent of the Sin­ga­pore Coun­cil of Women’s Or­gan­i­sa­tions, she has worked for var­i­ous women’s is­sues in­clud­ing do­mes­tic vi­o­lence and the use of the baby bonus in an­te­na­tal care. She was awarded the Pub­lic Ser­vice Medal in 2012 for her work in the or­gan­i­sa­tion.</p>
    <p>Since 2013, she has been a board mem­ber for Halo­gen, a not-for­profit in­sti­tu­tion which reaches out to dis­ad­van­taged youth. She has been in­volved in sev­eral projects here, in­clud­ing the Net­work For Teach­ing En­trepreneur­ship pro­gramme, which teaches young adults en­tre­pre­neur­ial skills</p>
    <p>“It’s all about giv­ing back. At Halo­gen, I’m here to make the lives of these kids bet­ter. I tell peo­ple my role is chief beg­gar,” quips the doc­tor who is also an ac­tive fundraiser for the or­gan­i­sa­tion.</p>
    <p>She en­joys her life and her work, she says.</p>
    <p>“I con­sider chil­dren as bless­ing and I’m not try­ing to play God. I’m try­ing to help women and men use med­i­cal abil­ity to help them achieve their de­sire for chil­dren. But I can never prom­ise any­one suc­cess as it is not mine to give.”</p>
