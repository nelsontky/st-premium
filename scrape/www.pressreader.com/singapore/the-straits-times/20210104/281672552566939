    <p>GUANGZHOU/BEI­JING • An im­ported coro­n­avirus vari­ant case has been detected in south­ern China’s Guang­dong prov­ince, the pro­vin­cial cen­tre for dis­ease con­trol and preven­tion said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The in­di­vid­ual is an 18-year-old Chi­nese na­tional who stud­ies in Bri­tain. He ar­rived in pro­vin­cial cap­i­tal Guangzhou from Bri­tain on Dec 4 last year and was quar­an­tined im­me­di­ately. He tested pos­i­tive for the coro­n­avirus and was di­ag­nosed as a con­firmed mild Covid-19 case on Dec 18.</p>
    <p>Gene se­quenc­ing anal­y­sis on Dec 27 showed that the pa­tient had the coro­n­avirus vari­ant B.1.1.7, which highly re­sem­bles the strain re­cently re­ported in Bri­tain. The vari­ant was con­firmed fol­low­ing a high-through­put se­quenc­ing dou­ble-check on Satur­day.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to the cen­tre, the B.1.1.7 coro­n­avirus vari­ant has a stronger trans­mis­sion ca­pac­ity but its symp­toms, fa­tal­ity rate and the risk of se­vere cases are ba­si­cally the same. The vac­cines that have been de­vel­oped are also ef­fec­tive against the new strain.</p>
    <p>The youth is un­der fur­ther med­i­cal ob­ser­va­tion af­ter be­ing dis­charged from hospi­tal.</p>
    <p>The Chi­nese main­land re­ported 16 new im­ported Covid-19 cases on Satur­day, bring­ing the to­tal num­ber of im­ported cases to 4,303, the Na­tional Health Com­mis­sion said in its daily re­port yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Six new im­ported cases were re­ported in Shang­hai, two each in the prov­inces of Fu­jian, Guang­dong and Shaanxi, and one each in Bei­jing, Tian­jin, In­ner Mon­go­lia and Liaon­ing, the com­mis­sion said.</p>
    <p>Among all the im­ported cases, 4,024 have been dis­charged from hospi­tal af­ter re­cov­ery while 279 re­main hos­pi­talised. No deaths have been re­ported among the im­ported cases.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, two uni­ver­si­ties in Bei­jing an­nounced on Satur­day that the win­ter va­ca­tion will start ear­lier than usual, in an ef­fort to re­duce the pres­sure of Covid-19 con­trol on cam­pus.</p>
    <p>Deputy party sec­re­tary Guo Yong from Ts­inghua Univer­sity said the win­ter va­ca­tion for un­der­grad­u­ate stu­dents would last from Jan 11 to Feb 21. Grad­u­ate stu­dents and teach­ers en­gaged in teach­ing and re­search work are re­quired to take the va­ca­tion be­tween Jan 14 and Feb 19.</p>
    <p>The school will strictly im­ple­ment epi­demic con­trol mea­sures on cam­pus. Vis­i­tors are re­quired to show healthy green codes or nu­cleic acid test cer­tifi­cates neg­a­tive for Covid-19 be­fore en­ter­ing the school, Pro­fes­sor Guo said.</p>
    <p>Mr Zhu Guang­hao, deputy party sec­re­tary of Bei­jing In­ter­na­tional Stud­ies Univer­sity, said the school started ar­rang­ing for stu­dents to leave for win­ter va­ca­tions in batches on Dec 14 and last Thurs­day.</p>
    <p>The Chi­nese cap­i­tal has tight­ened mea­sures to tackle Covid-19, as 25 lo­cally trans­mit­ted con­firmed cases were re­ported be­tween Dec 18 and last Fri­day. By Satur­day, the city had des­ig­nated seven ar­eas as medium risk.</p>
