    <p>The largest drop in in­fla­tion in the first half oc­curred among the top in­come earn­ers, ac­cord­ing to data out yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The Depart­ment of Sta­tis­tics Sin­ga­pore noted that over­all in­fla­tion fell 0.2 per cent in the six months to June 30, com­pared with the same pe­riod last year – re­vers­ing the 0.5 per cent in­crease in the sec­ond half of last year.</p>
    <p>The data for house­hold in­come shows that over­all in­fla­tion fell 0.2 per cent in the first half for the high­est 20 per cent of in­come earn­ers.</p>
    <p>This com­pares with a dip of 0.1 per cent for the mid­dle 60 per cent in­come group, while it re­mained un­changed for the low­est 20 per cent of in­come earn­ers.</p>
    <p>“For all three in­come groups, the de­clines in hol­i­day ex­penses and air­fares, out­pa­tient ser­vices costs, elec­tric­ity costs, petrol, and cloth­ing and footwear prices” were the main causes for the de­clines, the Depart­ment of Sta­tis­tics noted.</p>
    <p>It added that higher food prices and bus and train fares helped curb the level of de­cline.</p>
    <p>If im­puted rents on owner-oc­cu­pied ac­com­mo­da­tion are ex­cluded, in­fla­tion for the high­est 20 per cent in­come group fell by an even larger mar­gin of 0.3 per cent, com­pared with 0.2 per cent for mid­dle-in­come earn­ers and 0.1 per cent for the low­est­in­come group.</p>
    <p>The depart­ment noted that the high­est-in­come group saw a steeper de­cline in the costs of dis­cre­tionary ex­pen­di­ture items such as hol­i­days and cars, and that these items also ac­counted for a larger share of the to­tal ex­pen­di­ture for this cat­e­gory.</p>
    <p>How­ever, the in­crease in bus and train fares and pricier food had a smaller im­pact on this group, as these items ac­counted for a smaller share of their to­tal ex­pen­di­ture.</p>
