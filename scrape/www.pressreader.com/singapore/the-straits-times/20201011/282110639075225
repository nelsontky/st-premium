    <p>Cyrus Me­dora has been in­volved in Sin­ga­pore sport ad­min­is­tra­tion for over 25 years, first in wind­surf­ing, and then net­ball. But, for the next few weeks, he will also keep a keen eye on football – specif­i­cally, the Sin­ga­pore Premier League (SPL).</p>
    <p>On Fri­day evening, the Min­istry for Cul­ture, Com­mu­nity and Youth (MCCY) an­nounced the SPL, the only pro­fes­sional league here and which had been sus­pended since March, will restart this Satur­day.</p>
    <p>Its re­sump­tion, and the league’s im­ple­men­ta­tion of safe man­age­ment mea­sures, will be crit­i­cal for the wider ecosys­tem of lo­cal sport and hope­fully pave the way for its re­turn.</p>
    <p>The Net­ball Su­per League, for ex­am­ple, is sched­uled to tip off in Jan­uary.</p>
    <p>Me­dora, chief ex­ec­u­tive of Net­ball Sin­ga­pore, told The Sun­day Times: “Ev­ery­one in the lo­cal sports fra­ter­nity is ex­cited. Peo­ple are dy­ing to get back on court and play games again.</p>
    <p>“So it (SPL’s re­sump­tion) is wel­come news, and I sup­pose the au­thor­i­ties will take... the next few weeks to ob­serve how things go with them, be­fore de­cid­ing on other sports as well.”</p>
    <p>SPL matches will be played be­hind closed doors. Other mea­sures in­clude seg­re­gat­ing and lim­it­ing the num­ber of play­ers and of­fi­cials in­side a sta­dium and fort­nightly swab test­ing.</p>
    <p>While rev­enue is not a key driver in the SPL’s restart – lo­cal clubs are not heav­ily re­liant on gate re­ceipts or broad­cast rev­enue but govern­ment fund­ing, which is about $1 mil­lion for each club – it is a fac­tor in the re­turn of live in­ter­na­tional sports events, which also re­ceived a fil­lip on Fri­day.</p>
    <p>Hours af­ter MCCY’s an­nounce­ment, mixed mar­tial arts (MMA) or­gan­i­sa­tion One Cham­pi­onship held its Reign of Dy­nas­ties event, fea­tur­ing five over­seas fight­ers in the six bouts, be­hind closed doors at the Sin­ga­pore In­door Sta­dium.</p>
    <p>The live show was part of a pi­lot project the Sin­ga­pore Tourism Board hopes will help larger-scale sports events to re­sume.</p>
    <p>The Repub­lic hosts sev­eral mar­quee events an­nu­ally, like the HSBC Sin­ga­pore Rugby Sevens, football’s In­ter­na­tional Cham­pi­ons Cup (ICC) and the For­mula One Sin­ga­pore Grand Prix.</p>
    <p>All three, which fea­ture world­class stars from around the globe, were can­celled this year.</p>
    <p>Some of the govern­ment guide­lines spe­cific to One’s event meant over­seas-based fight­ers were not re­quired to un­dergo the manda­tory 14-day quar­an­tine or­der in place for reg­u­lar trav­ellers.</p>
    <p>One, how­ever, had to cre­ate a “bub­ble” where the ath­letes fol­lowed strict sched­ules and were es­corted by li­ai­son per­son­nel through­out their stay in a ho­tel, and al­lowed only in des­ig­nated ar­eas.</p>
    <p>The fights and two-hour show went smoothly but, given that this was a pi­lot project, it will be some time be­fore fans are al­lowed into sta­di­ums.</p>
    <p>Last year, the Sin­ga­pore leg of the Rugby Sevens at­tracted 57,000 fans, while the ICC drew 103,000 over two nights of football.</p>
    <p>Both were held at the Sin­ga­pore Sports Hub and get­ting spec­ta­tors back into the $1.33 bil­lion fa­cil­ity is un­sur­pris­ingly a pri­or­ity for its</p>
    <p>CEO Lionel Yeo.</p>
    <p>In Au­gust, he said his team had been work­ing on a “safe man­age­ment mea­sures over­lay” which could utilise the Sports</p>
    <p>Hub’s mul­ti­ple en­trance and exit points, and limit groups of spec­ta­tors to spe­cific zones.</p>
    <p>For such plans to ma­te­ri­alise, it will re­quire fur­ther test­ing and re­fin­ing of the stan­dard op­er­at­ing pro­ce­dures es­tab­lished in the SPL as well as sub­se­quent One events. The com­pany is un­der­stood to be lin­ing up another live show here in the com­ing months.</p>
    <p>Af­ter six months of dor­mancy, Sin­ga­pore sport is rar­ing to get back into ac­tion. An in­ci­dent-free next few months will be the per­fect launch pad for a hope­ful new year.</p>
