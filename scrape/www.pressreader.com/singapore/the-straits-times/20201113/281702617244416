    <p>A typhoon that gath­ered dev­as­tat­ing strength pum­melled the main is­land of Lu­zon overnight, dump­ing record levels of rain that set off mas­sive flood­ing and paral­ysed nearly all of Met­ro­pol­i­tan Manila yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Dra­matic res­cues played out across sev­eral cities in the cap­i­tal re­gion, with tens of thou­sands rowed out of flood wa­ters on rub­ber dinghies, small mo­torised boats, ca­noes and even jet skis.</p>
    <p>In Marik­ina city and nearby Rizal prov­ince, home to nearly three mil­lion, res­i­dents fled to the up­per floors of their homes or climbed onto rooftops as flood wa­ters rose rapidly af­ter a 78km river breached its banks.</p>
    <p>“We are over­whelmed by the ex­tent, mag­ni­tude of the flood­ing we are ex­pe­ri­enc­ing now... We are pre­par­ing for the worst-case sce­nario,” Marik­ina Mayor Marcelino Teodoro told ra­dio sta­tion DZBB.</p>
    <p>He said he had re­ceived re­ports that sev­eral of the peo­ple who had es­caped to their rooftops since the early hours of Thurs­day were al­ready suf­fer­ing from hy­pother­mia. “Many are ter­ri­fied,” he added.</p>
    <p>He pleaded for civil de­fence forces to send in he­li­copters to help with the res­cue. Up to 40,000 houses were left underwater, and his city had only 50 rub­ber boats to dis­patch, he said.</p>
    <p>Pres­i­dent Ro­drigo Duterte or­dered gov­ern­ment agen­cies to rush aid to peo­ple af­fected by Typhoon Vamco. “Rest as­sured, the gov­ern­ment will not leave any­body be­hind,” he said in a na­tional ad­dress, pledg­ing shel­ter, relief goods, fi­nan­cial aid and post-dis­as­ter coun­selling.</p>
    <p>Typhoon Vamco, known lo­cally as Ulysses, made land­fall at around 10.30pm in Pat­na­nun­gan town in Que­zon prov­ince, 130km east of the cap­i­tal Manila, with winds of up to 150kmh and max­i­mum gusts of 205kmh.</p>
    <p>The typhoon was not seen as par­tic­u­larly alarm­ing, as it had been clas­si­fied as a trop­i­cal storm through most of its jour­ney across the Pa­cific. But it quickly gath­ered strength as it ap­proached Lu­zon’s east­ern seaboard, and then rolled just 60km north of Manila on its way to the South China Sea.</p>
    <p>From late Wed­nes­day till noon yes­ter­day, hur­ri­cane-force winds and a heavy down­pour bat­tered Metro Manila.</p>
    <p>By early morn­ing yes­ter­day, huge swathes of the metropo­lis – home to some 13 mil­lion – were un­der waist-high flood wa­ters. Trees, elec­tric poles and a myr­iad of de­bris were strewn across roads. One photo posted on Twit­ter showed the steel roof of a house dan­gling pre­car­i­ously on a bunch of elec­tric ca­bles.</p>
    <p>Key high­ways were un­pass­able, and close to four mil­lion peo­ple were suf­fer­ing through a pro­longed black­out.</p>
    <p>Mr Teodoro said Vamco caught Marik­ina, which had al­ways been flood-prone due to its prox­im­ity to a river named af­ter the city, by sur­prise.</p>
    <p>But a top dis­as­ter-re­sponse of­fi­cial in­sisted the gov­ern­ment “was not caught flat-footed”. He said peo­ple caught in the typhoon’s fury might have been too com­pla­cent and re­lied more on their in­stinct, in­stead of heed­ing gov­ern­ment warn­ings.</p>
    <p>Mr Duterte him­self took is­sue with crit­ics who ac­cused him of sleep­ing on the job as the hash­tag #NasaanAngP­an­gulo (Where is the Pres­i­dent) again trended. He said: “Peo­ple are say­ing I’m not do­ing any­thing, just sleep­ing. No one here has had any sleep.”</p>
    <p>Out­side Metro Manila, Vamco bar­relled across re­gions still reel­ing from Goni and six other cy­clones that had sliced through the Philip­pines one af­ter the other since Oct 11. There were re­ports of land­slides in moun­tain­ous vil­lages, and storm surges pum­melling coastal towns.</p>
    <p>At least two peo­ple died, and four oth­ers were re­ported miss­ing, the Of­fice of Civil De­fence in the Bi­col re­gion re­ported. A sep­a­rate re­port said a boy in Cainta town, in Rizal, was killed af­ter a tree fell on him.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore aid agency Mercy Relief on Wed­nes­day launched a fund-rais­ing ap­peal for vic­tims of re­cent storms and floods in South­east Asia. The ap­peal runs un­til Dec 10.</p>
