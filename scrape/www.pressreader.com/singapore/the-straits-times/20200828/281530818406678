    <p>A sur­vivor of the New Zealand mosque mas­sacres cel­e­brat­ing out­side the High Court in Christchur­ch af­ter shooter Bren­ton Tar­rant was sen­tenced yes­ter­day. The 29-year-old Aus­tralian white su­prem­a­cist was sen­tenced to life in prison with­out pa­role for ter­ror­ism, 51 charges of mur­der and 40 charges of at­tempted mur­der, for his at­tack on two mosques in Christchur­ch last year. It was the first time a court in New Zealand had sen­tenced a per­son to prison for life. Christchur­ch High Court Judge Cameron Man­der said Tar­rant had shown no re­morse and that no mat­ter how long he spent in prison, it would not be long enough to atone for his crimes. Tar­rant had live-streamed the shoot­ing ram­page on Face­book.</p>
    <p>CRIMES SO WICKED</p>
    <p>Your crimes... are so wicked that even if you are de­tained un­til you die, it will not ex­haust the re­quire­ments of pun­ish­ment and de­nun­ci­a­tion. As far as</p>
    <p>I can dis­cern, you are empty of any em­pa­thy for ’’ your vic­tims.</p>
    <p>CHRISTCHUR­CH HIGH COURT JUDGE CAMERON MAN­DER, on Bren­ton Tar­rant’s lack of re­morse.</p>
    <p>NOT EAS­ILY HEALED</p>
    <p>The trauma of March 15 is not eas­ily healed, but today I hope is the last where we have any cause to hear or ut­ter the name of the ter­ror­ist be­hind it.</p>
    <p>His de­serves to be a life­time of com­plete and ’’ ut­ter si­lence.</p>
    <p>PRIME MIN­IS­TER JACINDA ARDERN , on not giv­ing the gun­man pub­lic­ity.</p>
    <p>WELLINGTON • A New Zealand judge sen­tenced white su­prem­a­cist Bren­ton Tar­rant to life in prison with­out pa­role yes­ter­day for killing 51 Mus­lim wor­ship­pers in the coun­try’s dead­li­est shoot­ing, say­ing the sen­tence was not enough pun­ish­ment for the “wicked” crimes.</p>
    <p>It was the first time a court in New Zealand had sen­tenced a per­son to prison for the rest of their life.</p>
    <p>Christchur­ch High Court Judge Cameron Man­der said Tar­rant had shown no re­morse and that no mat­ter how long he spent in prison, it would not be long enough to atone for his crimes.</p>
    <p>“Your crimes... are so wicked that even if you are de­tained un­til you die, it will not ex­haust the re­quire­ments of pun­ish­ment and de­nun­ci­a­tion,” said the j udge in hand­ing down the sen­tence.</p>
    <p>“As far as I am able to gauge, you are empty of any em­pa­thy for your vic­tims,” he said.</p>
    <p>Tar­rant, a 29-year-old Aus­tralian, ad­mit­ted to 51 charges of mur­der, 40 counts of at­tempted mur­der and one charge of com­mit­ting a ter­ror­ist act dur­ing the 2019 shoot­ing ram­page at two Christchur­ch mosques which he live-streamed on Face­book.</p>
    <p>On March 15 last year, Tar­rant stormed the Al Noor mosque in Christchur­ch armed with mil­i­tarystyle semi-au­to­mat­ics, in­dis­crim­i­nately shoot­ing at Mus­lims gath­ered for Fri­day prayers, while film­ing his mas­sacre from a head­mounted cam­era and play­ing a Ser­bian anti-Mus­lim an­them.</p>
    <p>He killed 44 peo­ple at Al Noor, the youngest a three-year-old boy shot at point blank range, then at­tacked a sec­ond mosque in the nearby sub­urb of Lin­wood, killing an­other seven peo­ple.</p>
    <p>Judge Man­der asked Tar­rant be­fore hand­ing down the sen­tence if he had any comment.</p>
    <p>Dressed in grey prison clothes and sur­rounded by guards, Tar­rant nod­ded when asked if he was aware he had the right to make sub­mis­sions, but he did not speak.</p>
    <p>“Today the le­gal pro­ce­dures for this heinous crime have been done. No pun­ish­ment will bring our l oved ones back,” said Mr Ga­mal Fouda, the imam of Al Noor mosque which was tar­geted. “Ex­trem­ists are all the same. Whether they use re­li­gion, na­tion­al­ism or any other ide­ol­ogy. All ex­trem­ists, they rep­re­sent hate. But we are here today. We re­spect love, compassion, Mus­lim and non-Mus­lim peo­ple of faith and of no faith.”</p>
    <p>Pros­e­cu­tors said Tar­rant had ac­cu­mu­lated more than 7,000 rounds of am­mu­ni­tion for the at­tack and wanted to in­stil fear in those he de­scribed as in­vaders and that he care­fully planned the at­tacks to cause max­i­mum car­nage.</p>
    <p>“The ha­tred that lies at the heart of your hos­til­ity to par­tic­u­lar mem­bers of the com­mu­nity that you came to this coun­try to mur­der has no place here – it has no place any­where,” Mr Man­der said.</p>
    <p>Prime Min­is­ter Jacinda Ardern said she was re­lieved “that per­son will never see the light of day”.</p>
    <p>“The trauma of March 15 is not eas­ily healed, but today I hope is the last where we have any cause to hear or ut­ter the name of the ter­ror­ist be­hind it. His de­serves to be a life­time of com­plete and ut­ter si­lence,” she said.</p>
    <p>The at­tack led to a ban on firearms in New Zealand and a cam­paign against hate con­tent on­line led by Ms Ardern, a re­sponse that was hailed as a model for other coun­tries.</p>
    <p>More than 90 sur­vivors and fam­i­lies of the vic­tims gave emo­tion­ally charged state­ments in court this week, call­ing for Tar­rant to be sen­tenced to life with­out pa­role.</p>
    <p>Many gath­ered in and out­side the court yes­ter­day to hear the sen­tence.</p>
    <p>“It’s a re­lief... We are not in a coun­try where we can expect the death penalty. But they have served jus­tice... giv­ing the max­i­mum prison time with­out pa­role,” said Ms Hina Amir, 34, who was out­side Al Noor mosque when Tar­rant at­tacked and sur­vived a hail of bul­lets in her car with her hus­band Amir Daud.</p>
    <p>The crime re­ceived wide at­ten­tion around the Mus­lim world and Turkey’s for­eign min­istry yes­ter­day noted “with plea­sure” that the heav­i­est-avail­able pun­ish­ment had been ap­plied for an at­tack which killed one and wounded two Turk­ish cit­i­zens.</p>
    <p>“The ver­dict re­minded the world once again of the need for the in­ter­na­tional com­mu­nity to fight jointly against all acts and ide­olo­gies based on Is­lam­o­pho­bia, xeno­pho­bia, racism and ha­tred.” ondly, there is no rea­son for that.”</p>
    <p>Rus­sian po­lice yes­ter­day an­nounced that they had be­gun a pre­lim­i­nary ex­am­i­na­tion of Mr Navalny’s ill­ness.</p>
    <p>Trans­port po­lice in Siberia said they have started “a pre-in­ves­ti­ga­tion check” into what led to his hos­pi­tal­i­sa­tion in the city of Omsk to es­tab­lish “all the cir­cum­stances” and de­cide whether to open a crim­i­nal probe.</p>
    <p>Rus­sian Pres­i­dent Vladimir Putin held a phone call with Ital­ian Prime Min­is­ter Giuseppe Conte on Wed­nes­day in which they dis­cussed Mr Navalny’s health.</p>
    <p>“The Rus­sian side stressed the in­ad­mis­si­bil­ity of hasty and un­founded ac­cu­sa­tions in this re­gard,” the Krem­lin said in a state­ment about the call.</p>
    <p>It said Moscow wanted the cir­cum­stances sur­round­ing Mr Navalny’s con­di­tion to come to light.</p>
    <p>Mr Peskov’s com­ments and Mr Putin’s phone call come a day af­ter the Speaker of Russia’s lower house of Par­lia­ment said a com­mit­tee would launch an in­quiry to de­ter­mine whether for­eign forces had played a hand in Mr Navalny’s ill­ness in or­der to fuel ten­sions in Russia.</p>
    <p>Ear­lier, a se­nior ally of Mr Navalny said he be­lieved only Mr Putin could have au­tho­rised the sus­pected poi­son­ing of the out­spo­ken Krem­lin critic.</p>
    <p>Mr Ivan Zh­danov, the direc­tor of Mr Navalny’s Anti-Cor­rup­tion Foun­da­tion (FBK), did not pro­vide any ev­i­dence for the claim. “He (Putin) hates what the FBK does too much, ex­pos­ing him and his en­tourage,” Mr Zh­danov said.</p>
    <p>The Krem­lin has dis­missed as “hot air” and un­true any sug­ges­tion Mr Putin was some­how in­volved in Mr Navalny’s al­leged poi­son­ing.</p>
