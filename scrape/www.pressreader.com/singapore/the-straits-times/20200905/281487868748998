    <p>Be­neath a grey sky, on a red run­way, comes a blur of yel­low spikes. Kamp­ton Kam is in the take-off busi­ness. His fa­ther, a Sin­ga­pore Air­lines pilot, re­quires roughly 2,000-3,000m of run­way for his Boe­ing 777, but the son re­quires only three steps and eight strides to get air­borne.</p>
    <p>The high jump seems like a type of haiku, a com­pressed ath­letic po­etry that lasts a few seconds, but in fact it’s a tech­ni­cal ex­er­cise in­volv­ing ve­loc­ity, an­gle, curve, arch, cen­tre of grav­ity. And Kam needs ev­ery skill he can muster to get over the bar be­cause he feels he’s not en­tirely phys­i­cally suited to leap that bar.</p>
    <p>Kam, sev­enth at the 2018 Youth Olympic Games, thinks he is a tri­fle short at 1.86m. Tall in the real world but a slightly ab­bre­vi­ated tal­ent in a lofty jump­ing planet. Let’s say he’s tired of look­ing up to his peers.</p>
    <p>He’d see ri­vals on YouTube and when he’d meet them for the first time he would be taken aback by their size be­cause the screen doesn’t ad­e­quately trans­late height. “This guy is tall,” he’d think. “In over­seas in­ter­na­tional com­pe­ti­tions,” he adds, “the av­er­age height is roughly 1.95m and when I line up next to them I feel in­tim­i­dated.”</p>
    <p>For jumpers, who are of­ten lon­g­legged, sinewy crea­tures, “height does mat­ter” says Dr Mar­cus Lee, team lead of the biome­chan­ics team at Sin­ga­pore Sport In­sti­tute. In its most ba­sic form, he says, with all else be­ing equal, it’s eas­ier to clear the bar if you’re taller be­cause your cen­tre of grav­ity is higher off the ground and thus closer to the bar.</p>
    <p>Kam, only 18, can leap over LeBron James’ 2.06m head with nine cen­time­tres to spare, but his height is his tough­est im­ped­i­ment. It’s in­trigu­ing be­cause he can over­come the prob­lem but he can’t re­ally fix it. It isn’t mus­cle, you can’t build it. It’s not stamina, you can’t train it.</p>
    <p>You can hang from bars, and he has; or drink milk to grow bones, which he tried (but he was lac­tose in­tol­er­ant); or qui­etly pray, and he did, but you can’t al­ter the build­ing blocks of DNA. He’s a tall man who has to work on not feel­ing small.</p>
    <p>Ath­letes are a fas­ci­nat­ing clut­ter of tics, in­se­cu­ri­ties, fears, which may seem ir­ra­tional to you but are real to them. For Kam – earnest, de­voted, lively, hon­est – a phys­i­cal ob­sta­cle be­came a men­tal itch.</p>
    <p>“In Sin­ga­pore they don’t have that many high jumpers and not that tall ones and I am not used to get­ting stared down. So it be­comes a psy­cho­log­i­cal game. It starts from the be­gin­ning, even be­fore the com­pe­ti­tion, so I am just learn­ing to over­come it, to re­main men­tally strong and fo­cus on my­self.”</p>
    <p>In a sport con­cerned with el­e­va­tion, size has been an old story for the young Kam. As a boy he was ini­tially taller than av­er­age, then stopped grow­ing, then made hes­i­tant up­ward progress. “The age ev­ery­one had spurts I felt left out. It made me more con­scious of the bar and the gap be­tween me and the win­ning heights was get­ting huge. For a young teenager, not hav­ing the ex­pe­ri­ence and tenac­ity, it def­i­nitely weighed me down.”</p>
    <p>From 15-17 he grew 10cm and yet in the mir­ror he was never tall enough for his art. Still, he per­se­vered and there is a won­der to this. Peo­ple don’t al­ways love a sport, or even a dance form, be­cause they fit it phys­i­cally. Some­times they find a way to fit be­cause they love it.</p>
    <p>Svet­lana Khork­ina (1.65m) was con­sid­ered too tall to be a great gym­nast, Misty Copeland too mus­cu­lar to be a bal­let dancer, Allen Iver­son (1.83m) too short to dom­i­nate basketball. But these so-called phys­i­cal mis­fits pro­duced magic.</p>
    <p>And so that’s what Kam is do­ing, search­ing as climbers do for his own route to­wards his peak. He talks point­edly about a Bri­tish coach, who he saw on YouTube, who said high jump is man against bar, not against some­one else. It’s about fo­cus­ing on the right fight.</p>
    <p>As he rum­mages through jump videos on YouTube and In­sta­gram, he no­tices that some jumpers don’t fit a clas­si­cal body shape. “But they can still com­pete at an elite level and that def­i­nitely pro­vides en­cour­age­ment.” In­deed, the fan­tas­tic Ste­fan Holm, 2004 Olympic cham­pion, jumped 2.40m (in­doors) and he’s only 1.81m while the freak­ish Franklin Ja­cobs, only 1.73m tall, leapt 2.32m in­doors in 1978.</p>
    <p>Like them, Kam can’t al­ter his height, but he can find ways to com­pen­sate. An ab­sence of inches can be off­set by ad­just­ing a mind­set, by hon­ing tech­nique, by work­ing on pos­ture, power, run-up. “I want to be some­one who can just bounce over a bar but it re­quires years of work to find the right elas­tic­ity.”</p>
    <p>As we chat, he sends me a video from the Hong Kong in­ter-city Athletics Cham­pi­onships in June 2018. A storm is rag­ing, of­fi­cials are in rain­coats, pud­dles have formed and in the pour­ing rain he takes off.</p>
    <p>He was com­pet­ing against Tai­wan’s Fu Zhao-xian, who is half-ahead taller, and there’s a photo taken of them, both on the top level of the podium, tied for gold. Kam is grin­ning and maybe it’s be­cause on a sin­gle day he rose above ev­ery­thing na­ture could throw at him.</p>
    <p>He’d taken a leap of faith and proved that tape mea­sures tell in­com­plete tales. Heart, as he likes to say, had over­come height.</p>
    <p>Kam, only 18, can leap over LeBron James’ 2.06m head with nine cen­time­tres to spare, but his height is his tough­est im­ped­i­ment. It’s in­trigu­ing be­cause he can over­come the prob­lem but he can’t re­ally fix it. It isn’t mus­cle, you can’t build it. It’s not stamina, you can’t train it.</p>

        <p data-role="text">Kamp&#xAD;ton Kam (in ac&#xAD;tion, left, and at rest, be&#xAD;low) is tired of look&#xAD;ing up to his peers. While he is much taller than the av&#xAD;er&#xAD;age lo&#xAD;cal man at 1.86m, he is 9cm be&#xAD;low the av&#xAD;er&#xAD;age height of high jumpers at over&#xAD;seas in&#xAD;ter&#xAD;na&#xAD;tional com&#xAD;pe&#xAD;ti&#xAD;tions.</p>
