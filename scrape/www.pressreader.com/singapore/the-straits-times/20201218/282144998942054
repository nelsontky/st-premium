    <p>When Nu­raini Mo­hamed Faizal was in Sec­ondary 1 in 2017, she was di­ag­nosed with fa­mil­ial ade­no­ma­tous poly­po­sis, an in­her­ited dis­or­der which causes ab­nor­mal growth in the colon and de­vel­ops into can­cer if not treated with surgery.</p>
    <p>“I was sad be­cause I didn’t ex­pect it to come at such a young age. I was also shocked be­cause it was a se­ri­ous con­di­tion to be go­ing through at that time,” said the Bowen Sec­ondary School stu­dent, now 16, who was among 13,384 stu­dents who sat and passed this year’s N-level ex­am­i­na­tions. They re­ceived their re­sults yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Her mum, who has the same con­di­tion, de­vel­oped can­cer as a re­sult of it in 2016, and her 14-year-old sis­ter has sim­i­lar tis­sue growths.</p>
    <p>Be­cause of the di­ag­no­sis, Nu­raini’s doc­tor ad­vised her to give up her co-cur­ric­u­lar ac­tiv­ity (CCA) – Malay dance. She did, opt­ing for the less rig­or­ous Li­brary Club.</p>
    <p>In early 2019, ex­ces­sive bleed­ing due to her con­di­tion led to anaemia and she had to un­dergo blood trans­fu­sions ev­ery three months.</p>
    <p>The mul­ti­ple med­i­cal ap­point­ments meant miss­ing classes and hav­ing to find out what she missed from her friends.</p>
    <p>How­ever, Nu­raini’s set­backs have not damp­ened her out­look on life and she counts her late grand­mother and mother among her pil­lars of strength.</p>
    <p>“When my grandma was di­ag­nosed with can­cer in 2016 (due to a sim­i­lar con­di­tion), she never lost faith and con­tin­ued to live life as per nor­mal,” she said of her grand­mother, who died in 2017.</p>
    <p>Af­ter pass­ing her ex­ams, de­cid­ing where to study next is not the only de­ci­sion fac­ing her.</p>
    <p>Last year, a doc­tor ad­vised her to re­move her colon to min­imise the tis­sue growths from turn­ing can­cer­ous, but she has yet to make a de­ci­sion on this. “I still have sec­ond thoughts be­cause life will not be the same, ” she said, adding that post-surgery, she will likely need to use stoma bags.</p>
    <p>But she looks to the fu­ture pos­i­tively and as­pires to be a lawyer, and she is grate­ful for her sec­ondary school teach­ers’ sup­port.</p>
    <p>One she will never for­get is Mrs Ber­nice Kuan, who was in charge of the Sec­ondary 4 and 5 co­horts.</p>
    <p>“Af­ter she knew of my con­di­tion in Sec 1, she never stopped reach­ing out to me... re­mind­ing me that it will not stop me from achiev­ing my dreams,” said Nu­raini.</p>
    <p>Also pay­ing trib­ute to his teach­ers yes­ter­day was Crest Sec­ondary School stu­dent Xan­der Ng, 17, who lost his mother to can­cer when he was 12. But he re­bounded to be­come “ma­ture, sen­si­tive and very em­pa­thetic”, said his co-form teacher Chang Yi Ping.</p>
    <p>Xan­der said: “When I’m down, my teach­ers will al­ways be there.</p>
    <p>Even though some­times they can be strict, I un­der­stand that it’s for us.”</p>
    <p>Ms Chang said she un­der­stood Xan­der’s “emo­tions and sad­ness” when she heard of his story as she lost her own mother when she was just four.</p>
    <p>On what keeps her mo­ti­vated as a teacher, she said: “Watch­ing the stu­dents grow up in­di­vid­u­ally at their own pace... and de­vel­op­ing a for­ward-look­ing pur­pose and de­sire to im­prove the qual­ity of their lives re­ally makes me very proud of them.”</p>
