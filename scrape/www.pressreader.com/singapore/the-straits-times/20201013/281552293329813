    <p>Plans are un­der way to set up an­other all-women half­way house here. It is ex­pected to open its doors in 2023. The Sin­ga­pore Prison Ser­vice will work with the Sin­ga­pore Mus­lim Women’s As­so­ci­a­tion to set up the new all-women half­way house, the sec­ond in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>Plans are un­der way to set up a sec­ond all-women half­way house in Sin­ga­pore, with the fa­cil­ity ex­pected to open its doors in 2023.</p>
    <p>The Sin­ga­pore Prison Ser­vice will work with the Sin­ga­pore Mus­lim Women’s As­so­ci­a­tion to set up the fa­cil­ity.</p>
    <p>Min­is­ter of State for Home Af­fairs and Na­tional De­vel­op­ment Muham­mad Faishal Ibrahim an­nounced this dur­ing his visit to all­women res­i­den­tial half­way house The Turn­ing Point in Ja­maica Road in Sem­bawang yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Not­ing that more sup­port can be given to women for­mer of­fend­ers through the half­way house model, he said: “The Turn­ing Point has played a very sig­nif­i­cant role in pro­vid­ing the re­ha­bil­i­ta­tion jour­ney for ex-of­fend­ers.”</p>
    <p>“We find that when women come back to so­ci­ety, they need that so­cial sup­port and net­work that will help them in the re­ha­bil­i­ta­tion process. At the same time, they would be play­ing a big­ger role in the care­giv­ing needs of their fam­i­lies.”</p>
    <p>He added that so­cial sup­port would ben­e­fit not just women for­mer of­fend­ers but also strengthen their fam­i­lies in the process.</p>
    <p>Dr Faishal said the up­com­ing half­way house will be open to fe­male res­i­dents of all races and re­li­gions.</p>
    <p>The Turn­ing Point pro­vides re­ha­bil­i­ta­tion ser­vices to sub­stance abusers and re­cov­er­ing abusers. Op­er­at­ing since 1990, it now houses 18 res­i­dents in their 20s to 60s.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing his visit yes­ter­day, Dr Faishal ac­knowl­edged the chal­lenge for for­mer of­fend­ers to se­cure jobs af­ter rein­te­grat­ing into so­ci­ety, and said: “While Yel­low Rib­bon Sin­ga­pore is work­ing hard to ex­plore em­ploy­ment op­por­tu­ni­ties for our ex-of­fend­ers, I am happy to ob­serve that the half­way houses are also play­ing their part in not only cre­at­ing op­por­tu­ni­ties but also pro­vid­ing the skills needed for them while they are at the half­way houses.</p>
    <p>“I as­sure you that we are work­ing very hard to cre­ate op­por­tu­ni­ties, and our com­mu­nity part­ners are with us to make sure we pro­vide as many op­por­tu­ni­ties as pos­si­ble for them to be rein­te­grated into the com­mu­nity but also find a job and sus­tain their lives and fam­i­lies.”</p>
    <p>Dur­ing a visit to The Turn­ing Point last October, Pres­i­dent Hal­imah Ya­cob sug­gested the open­ing of an­other half­way house for women as a way to im­prove the re­ha­bil­i­ta­tion of re­cov­er­ing fe­male drug ad­dicts.</p>
    <p>Em­pha­sis­ing the im­por­tance of early in­ter­ven­tion, she noted that most women be­came drug abusers be­cause of their part­ners, so more had to be done to pre­vent that.</p>
