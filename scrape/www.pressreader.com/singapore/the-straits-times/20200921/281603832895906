    <p>Openly chal­leng­ing the monar­chy of Thai King Maha Va­ji­ra­longkorn, thou­sands of protesters marched in Bangkok yes­ter­day to present their de­mands, which in­cluded a call for re­forms to curb his pow­ers.

    <p>BANGKOK • Openly chal­leng­ing the monar­chy of Thai King Maha Va­ji­ra­longkorn, thou­sands of protesters marched in Bangkok yes­ter­day to present de­mands that in­clude a call for re­forms to curb his pow­ers.</p>
    <p>Protesters have grown bolder dur­ing two months of demon­stra­tions against Thai­land’s palace and mil­i­tary-dom­i­nated es­tab­lish­ment, break­ing a long­stand­ing taboo on crit­i­cis­ing the monar­chy – which is il­le­gal un­der lese ma­jeste laws.</p>
    <p>The Royal Palace was not im­me­di­ately avail­able for com­ment.</p>
    <p>The King, who spends much of his time in Europe, is not in Thai­land now.</p>
    <p>The marchers were blocked by hun­dreds of un­armed po­lice man­ning crowd con­trol bar­ri­ers.</p>
    <p>Protest lead­ers de­clared vic­tory af­ter hand­ing the po­lice a let­ter de­tail­ing their de­mands.</p>
    <p>Metropoli­tan Po­lice Bu­reau head Phakphong Phong­phetra said in a video broad­cast from the scene that the let­ter would be handed to the po­lice head­quar­ters to de­cide how to pro­ceed.</p>
    <p>Mr Parit “Pen­guin” Chi­warak, told the crowd be­fore it dis­persed: “Our great­est vic­tory in the two days is show­ing that or­di­nary peo­ple like us can send a let­ter to roy­als.”</p>
    <p>At the big­gest demon­stra­tion in years on Satur­day, tens of thou­sands of protesters cheered calls for re­form of the monar­chy, for a new Con­sti­tu­tion and elec­tions, as well as for the re­moval of Prime Min­is­ter Prayut Chan-o-cha, a for­mer junta leader.</p>
    <p>Shortly af­ter sun­rise yes­ter­day, protesters ce­mented a plaque near the Grand Palace in Bangkok in an area known as Sanam Luang, or Royal Field. It reads: “At this place, the peo­ple have ex­pressed their will: that this coun­try be­longs to the peo­ple and is not the prop­erty of the monarch as they have de­ceived us.”</p>
    <p>Gov­ern­ment spokesman Anucha Bu­ra­pachaisri said the po­lice would not use vi­o­lence against the protesters, and it was up to the po­lice to de­ter­mine and pros­e­cute any il­le­gal speech.</p>
    <p>Bangkok’s deputy po­lice chief Piya Tawichai told re­porters that the au­thor­i­ties would need to de­ter­mine whether the plaque is il­le­gal and if it is, it would be re­moved.</p>
    <p>But not all Thais sup­port the new plaque, which re­sem­bles one that com­mem­o­rated the end of ab­so­lute monar­chy in 1932 and which was re­moved from out­side the palace in 2017, af­ter King Va­ji­ra­longkorn took the throne.</p>
    <p>Prom­i­nent right-wing politi­cian Warong Dechgitvi­grom said the ac­tions of the protesters were in­ap­pro­pri­ate and that the King was above pol­i­tics.</p>
    <p>“It didn’t achieve any­thing,” he told Reuters. “Th­ese ac­tions are sym­bol­i­cally against the King, but the King is not an op­po­nent.”</p>
    <p>The next protest is sched­uled for Thurs­day. Protest lead­ers also called on Thais to take Oct 14 off work to show their sup­port for change.</p>
