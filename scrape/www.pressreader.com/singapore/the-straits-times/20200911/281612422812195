    <p>The global death toll from Covid-19 passed 900,000 on Wed­nes­day, as world­wide cases topped</p>
    <p>27.7 mil­lion, ac­cord­ing to a Reuters tally. The US re­mains the world’s worst-af­fected coun­try.</p>
    <p>LONDON • The global death toll from Covid-19 passed the 900,000 mark on Wed­nes­day, as world­wide cases topped 27.7 mil­lion, ac­cord­ing to a Reuters tally.</p>
    <p>The United States re­mains the world’s worst-af­fected coun­try, with deaths ex­ceed­ing 190,000 and cases ex­ceed­ing 6.3 mil­lion.</p>
    <p>Brazil is in sec­ond place with more than 127,000 deaths, fol­lowed by In­dia with nearly 74,000 dead.</p>
    <p>On Mon­day, In­dia re­ported 90,802 new con­firmed in­fec­tions – its high­est-ever daily jump – bring­ing its to­tal to over 4.3 mil­lion and bump­ing Brazil with its 4.1 mil­lion cases to third place.</p>
    <p>As the epi­cen­tre of the pan­demic shifts to In­dia, there is no sign of a peak in the world’s sec­ond-most pop­u­lous na­tion.</p>
    <p>Bars i n In­dia re­opened on Wed­nes­day for the first time since a lock­down, even as the coun­try adds more cases each day than any other coun­try since the start of the year. In­dia is also record­ing more deaths than any other coun­try – an av­er­age of more than 1,000 daily for the last two weeks.</p>
    <p>The Amer­i­cas still ac­count for more than half of all fa­tal­i­ties world­wide ow­ing to high death counts in Mexico, Peru, Colom­bia, Chile and Ecuador.</p>
    <p>An av­er­age of more than 5,600 peo­ple die each day from Covid-19, ac­cord­ing to Reuters cal­cu­la­tions based on data from the last two weeks. The rate of deaths is hold­ing steady, tak­ing 18 days to climb from 800,000 to 900,000 deaths. It took 17 days to go from 700,000 to 800,000.</p>
    <p>In­dia’s fa­tal­ity rate is about 1 per cent, while Brazil and the US have mor­tal­ity rates of about 3 per cent, in line with the world av­er­age.</p>
    <p>While both deaths and cases in the US are down from a July peak, in­fec­tions are ris­ing in about 40 per cent of the coun­try, ex­ac­er­bated in part by the re­turn of stu­dents to col­lege towns.</p>
    <p>As in­fec­tions re­bound in parts of Europe, coun­tries have re­cently seen sin­gle-day records in new cases sim­i­lar to those seen dur­ing spring, sig­nalling a sec­ond wave is un­der way.</p>
    <p>The sharp rise of al­most 3,000 new cases in Bri­tain at the week­end was the high­est jump since May, prompt­ing a ban on gath­er­ings of more than six peo­ple as Prime Min­is­ter Boris John­son tries to con­trol the spike.</p>
    <p>Bri­tain, which has the fifth-high­est death toll world­wide at 41,594, has a 14-day quar­an­tine pol­icy for re­turn­ers from Euro­pean hol­i­day des­ti­na­tions such as some Greek is­lands, France, Croa­tia and Spain, which are ex­pe­ri­enc­ing sim­i­lar spikes.</p>
    <p>Spain was the first coun­try in West­ern Europe to record more than half a mil­lion cases on Mon­day, and now has a to­tal of 552,000 in­fec­tions.</p>
    <p>An av­er­age of more than 5,600 peo­ple die each day from Covid-19, ac­cord­ing to Reuters cal­cu­la­tions based on data from the last two weeks. The rate of deaths is hold­ing steady, tak­ing 18 days to climb from 800,000 to 900,000 deaths. It took 17 days to go from 700,000 to 800,000.</p>
