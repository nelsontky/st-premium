    <p>Q I am await­ing my daugh­ter’s sec­ondary school post­ing re­sults later this month. Can you ex­plain the post­ing sys­tem that will be used this year? What hap­pens when there is a tie-break and does putting a school as first choice give a stu­dent pri­or­ity?</p>
    <p>A The new Pri­mary School Leav­ing Ex­am­i­na­tion (PSLE) scor­ing sys­tem will take ef­fect only next year. So, this year, the old scor­ing sys­tem ap­plies.</p>
    <p>Pupils will be posted to the sec­ondary school of their choice based on their ag­gre­gate score in the PSLE.</p>
    <p>First, pupils are ranked ac­cord­ing to de­tailed ag­gre­gate scores that ex­tend to dec­i­mal points. The No. 1 pupil is posted to the school at the top of his list of six choices. Like­wise the sec­ond pupil and so on, un­til there are no more va­can­cies in the school.</p>
    <p>The pupil who fails to get his top choice will be posted to the next school on his list. If that school is also full, he will be sent to his third­choice school, and so on.</p>
    <p>Pupils who fail to get a place in any of their choices of schools will be posted to one near their home that still has va­can­cies. But they must have met the school’s low­est PSLE ag­gre­gate.</p>
    <p>Those still with­out a school will be posted to one in other postal dis­tricts that still has va­can­cies.</p>
    <p>You asked what hap­pens when there is a tie.</p>
    <p>Where there are two or more pupils with the same rounded ag­gre­gate score vy­ing for the last place in a school, they will be posted based on their cit­i­zen­ship.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore­ans get in first, fol­lowed by per­ma­nent res­i­dents and in­ter­na­tional pupils.</p>
    <p>If there is still a tie – be­tween two Sin­ga­pore­ans, for ex­am­ple – the one with the higher un­rounded ag­gre­gate score will be posted to the school first. If the two have the same un­rounded ag­gre­gate score, then post­ing will be de­ter­mined by a com­put­erised bal­lot.</p>
    <p>You did not say if your daugh­ter’s school has an af­fil­i­ated sec­ondary school. If a pupil wants to go to an af­fil­i­ated sec­ondary school, then she must in­di­cate it as her first choice. This gives her pri­or­ity. But it does not guar­an­tee ad­mis­sion; it is sub­ject to the avail­abil­ity of places.</p>
    <p>Pupils must also meet ad­di­tional qual­i­fy­ing cri­te­ria set by the af­fil­i­ated sec­ondary school.</p>
    <p>At least 20 per cent of the to­tal places in each aca­demic course – Ex­press, Nor­mal (Aca­demic) and Nor­mal (Tech­ni­cal) – will be set aside for pupils who do not ben­e­fit from af­fil­i­a­tion pri­or­ity.</p>
    <p>Af­fil­i­ated pupils who are not posted to their first choice will be con­sid­ered for their next choice school.</p>
    <p>For dual-track schools of­fer­ing both In­te­grated Pro­gramme (IP) and the O-level track, af­fil­i­a­tion con­sid­er­a­tions will be given only for those ap­ply­ing for the O-level track.</p>
    <p>You also asked if the or­der of school choice mat­ters when there is a tie-break.</p>
    <p>For this year’s P6 co­hort, the or­der in which pupils list their school choices does not give them pri­or­ity in de­ter­min­ing who gets a place.</p>
    <p>For ex­am­ple, your daugh­ter and an­other pupil are vy­ing for the last place in School A, and they have the same ag­gre­gate score and are both Sin­ga­pore cit­i­zens.</p>
    <p>It will not mat­ter if your daugh­ter listed School A as her first choice and the other stu­dent had listed it as her third. In this case, the post­ing will be de­ter­mined by a com­put­erised bal­lot with an equal chance for each stu­dent.</p>
    <p>The choice or­der of schools will play a more sig­nif­i­cant role next year when the new PSLE scor­ing sys­tem comes into ef­fect.</p>
    <p>A pupil who in­di­cates a school as his or her first choice will get a place ahead of some­one else with the same score, but in­di­cates it as a sec­ond or third choice.</p>
    <p>The sec­ondary school post­ing re­sults will be re­leased on Dec 22.</p>
