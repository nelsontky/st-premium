    <p>A new law to reg­u­late guns, ex­plo­sives and weapons in Sin­ga­pore will not ap­ply to replica weapons be­cause they pose too lit­tle risk to war­rant tight reg­u­la­tion, said Min­is­ter of State for Home Af­fairs Des­mond Tan yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Nerf guns, which can be bought off the shelf for recre­ational pur­poses and are un­likely to cause injury if used prop­erly, are also ex­cluded from the Guns, Ex­plo­sives and Weapons Con­trol Bill, which was passed in Par­lia­ment.</p>
    <p>But or­na­men­tal weapons such as dag­gers and swords will be con­sid­ered for class li­cens­ing. This is a “light touch” ap­proach which will ap­ply only to lower-risk ac­tiv­i­ties such as air gun shoot­ing in schools, as such li­cens­ing is con­sid­ered less strin­gent than in­di­vid­ual li­cens­ing.</p>
    <p>Pre­vi­ously, the Arms and Ex­plo­sives Act – which has been re­placed by the new law – re­quired all per­sons con­duct­ing ac­tiv­i­ties re­lated to guns, ex­plo­sives and weapons to be ei­ther in­di­vid­u­ally li­censed or to be ex­empted, which means they will fall out­side the Act.</p>
    <p>Thank­ing mem­bers of the House for their sup­port, Mr Tan said: “The Bill is a cru­cial piece of leg­is­la­tion that will go a long way to con­tinue to en­sure safe, se­cure and re­spon­si­ble GEW (guns, ex­plo­sives and weapons) han­dling in Sin­ga­pore.”</p>
    <p>The Bill was aimed at fur­ther tight­en­ing con­trols for guns, ex­plo­sives and weapons, and strength­en­ing penal­ties for high­risk items such as au­to­matic weapons.</p>
    <p>Other than guard­ing against ex­trem­ist at­tacks where such items could be used, the Bill was also meant to deal with ad­vance­ments such as 3D print­ing of guns or gun parts with de­signs taken from the In­ter­net, as well as the threat of armed drones.</p>
    <p>The unau­tho­rised pos­ses­sion of a dig­i­tal blue­print for a gun or gun part has been crim­i­nalised un­der the Bill. Max­i­mum fines for gun and ex­plo­sive of­fences have been raised to $50,000 for in­di­vid­u­als and $100,000 for en­ti­ties, up from $10,000.</p>
    <p>A to­tal of 11 MPs spoke dur­ing the de­bate on the Bill yes­ter­day, rais­ing con­cerns that ranged from how li­cence ap­pli­cants are as­sessed to whether in­no­va­tion in 3D print­ing would be sti­fled.</p>
    <p>Mr Louis Ng (Nee Soon GRC) asked if replica and imi­ta­tion weapons are cov­ered un­der the Bill, and Mr Melvin Yong (Radin Mas) asked if the pos­ses­sion of dig­i­tal blue­prints for gun repli­cas would be crim­i­nalised.</p>
    <p>In his round-up speech, Mr Tan said an ex­haus­tive list of weapons reg­u­lated is spelt out in the Bill, which in­cludes axes, throw­ing stars and bay­o­nets. Replica weapons are not reg­u­lated as they are un­likely to be ef­fec­tive in caus­ing in­juries or death.</p>
    <p>But the use of an i mi­ta­tion weapon to threaten or cause fear of injury or death to others would likely be an of­fence un­der other Acts such as the Pe­nal Code, he said.</p>
    <p>The unau­tho­rised pos­ses­sion of dig­i­tal blue­prints is lim­ited to guns and ma­jor gun parts as these are as­sessed to pose the high­est risk, ne­ces­si­tat­ing strong con­trols, he said, adding that there is no need to con­trol the pos­ses­sion of blue­prints for weapons like swords and knuck­le­dusters at the mo­ment as they are less dan­ger­ous.</p>
    <p>Ms Yeo Wan Ling (Pasir RisPung­gol GRC) said that some in the 3D print­ing com­mu­nity have pointed out that 3D-printed guns are un­likely to func­tion as they can­not with­stand the pres­sure of fir­ing a bul­let.</p>
    <p>She said that reg­u­la­tion of 3D print­ing should be done cau­tiously, oth­er­wise a “chill­ing ef­fect” might be pro­duced on the use of such in­no­va­tive tech­nolo­gies.</p>
    <p>Mr Tan replied that the threat of 3D-printed guns and gun parts is real. “This point was echoed by other mem­bers as well. There have been gen­uine cases and on­line videos demon­strat­ing the use of 3D-printed guns or gun parts, es­pe­cially metal­lic ones.”</p>
    <p>Ms Sylvia Lim (Alju­nied GRC) asked how a li­cens­ing of­fi­cer as­sesses in­for­ma­tion sub­mit­ted in ap­pli­ca­tions, es­pe­cially from for­eign­ers, such as those who need short-term li­cences for trade fairs.</p>
    <p>Mr Tan said the po­lice li­cens­ing of­fi­cer will re­quest rel­e­vant doc­u­ments from for­eign ap­pli­cants to show that they have been au­tho­rised by their coun­tries to han­dle guns, ex­plo­sives and weapons.</p>
    <p>Mr Zhulka­r­nain Abdul Rahim (Chua Chu Kang GRC) asked for more clar­ity on the sit­u­a­tions where the Home Af­fairs Min­is­ter could ex­er­cise his new power to is­sue se­cu­rity di­rec­tions.</p>
    <p>Un­der the new Bill, the min­is­ter can is­sue such di­rec­tions when a sit­u­a­tion re­quires a more ex­pe­di­ent re­sponse than mod­i­fy­ing li­cens­ing con­di­tions al­lows, such as if there is im­mi­nent threat to life or prop­erty.</p>
    <p>Mr Tan said a pos­si­ble sce­nario is when there is an on­go­ing or sus­pected ter­ror­ist in­ci­dent. “In such a sce­nario, is­su­ing a se­cu­rity di­rec­tion would be crit­i­cal to mit­i­gate the threat first,” he said.</p>
    <p>MIT­I­GATE THREAT FIRST</p>
    <p>In such a sce­nario, is­su­ing a se­cu­rity di­rec­tion would be crit­i­cal to mit­i­gate the threat first.</p>
    <p>MIN­IS­TER OF STATE FOR HOME AF­FAIRS DES­MOND TAN, cit­ing a sit­u­a­tion where the Home Af­fairs Min­is­ter could ex­er­cise his new power to is­sue se­cu­rity di­rec­tions, such as when there is an on­go­ing or sus­pected ter­ror­ist in­ci­dent.</p>
