    <p>An in­spi­ra­tion to ev­ery player in the same era. That is how Sin­ga­pore’s great­est foot­ballers, V. Sun­dram Moor­thy and Fandi Ah­mad, re­mem­ber Diego Maradona, who died aged 60 on Wed­nes­day.</p>
    <p>Sun­dram, who counts Maradona as his favourite player, told The Straits Times: “Sim­ply put, watch­ing him play was a joy.”</p>
    <p>As it came to be, Sun­dram him­self carved out a sim­i­lar rep­u­ta­tion as Maradona – skil­ful but volatile, en­ter­tain­ing but un­pre­dictable.</p>
    <p>The 55-year-old, nick­named “The Daz­zler” by Sin­ga­pore fans dur­ing the Malaysia Cup days in the 80s and 90s, was even dubbed “Kedah’s Maradona” by fans of the Malaysian state when he played for them in 1990.</p>
    <p>It comes as no sur­prise then that Sun­dram cited the South Amer­i­can as a “ma­jor in­flu­ence” dur­ing his play­ing days.</p>
    <p>“Ob­vi­ously as a player you want to be dif­fer­ent from other play­ers, and try to do some­thing to en­ter­tain the fans,” he said. “And when I watch great play­ers like Maradona, I tried to do some of the things he did on the pitch, and prac­tised the skills over and over.”</p>
    <p>Fandi, mean­while, rates Maradona as one of the top two play­ers of all time – along­side Brazil leg­end Pele – and even shared the pitch with the Ar­gen­tinian su­per­star once.</p>
    <p>This was when he was in­vited to play in a Se­lan­gor Se­lec­tion that took on Ar­gen­tinian side Boca Ju­niors in Kuala Lumpur in 1982. Fandi even scored in the game that</p>
    <p>Boca won 2-1.</p>
    <p>“It was an hon­our to play with one of the best play­ers – if not the best – in the world,” said Fandi, 58. “He was a player with great skill and ta­lent, an in­spi­ra­tion to all.”</p>
    <p>He added that be­cause Maradona was on their team, the goal he scored against Boca ranks as one of his most mem­o­rable.</p>
    <p>Fandi had a few clashes with the Ar­gen­tinian dur­ing the game, and found him to be a tough cus­tomer.</p>
    <p>“He was very quick, and had a very low cen­tre of grav­ity. It was very dif­fi­cult to push him off the ball. You can see so many video clips of de­fend­ers try­ing to push or tackle him, and he just would not go down. He was built very wide and his leg mus­cles were solid.”</p>
    <p>Four years later, Fandi got an­other close-up view of Maradona when he trav­elled to Mex­ico to watch the 1986 World Cup, which Ar­gentina went on to win.</p>
    <p>Fandi chuck­led when he re­called Maradona’s in­fa­mous Hand of God moment in the quar­ter-fi­nal against Eng­land.</p>
    <p>“I was there, seated very close to the ground, and from where I was, it was very clear,” he said.</p>
    <p>The Hand of God is also what Sun­dram said he would re­mem­ber Maradona most for.</p>
    <p>He said: “The sec­ond goal (in the 1986 fi­nal) where he drib­bled past so many peo­ple, was a great goal of course. But the Hand of God was some­thing that had never hap­pened in foot­ball. It was quick think­ing, and how he did it, putting his hand close to his head… some may say it was not pure sports­man­ship... but hey, that’s Maradona.”</p>
