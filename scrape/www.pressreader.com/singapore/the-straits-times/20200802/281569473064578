    <p>Warn­ing that the country’s health­care sys­tem is on the brink of col­lapse, dozens of Philip­pine doc­tors’ and nurses’ groups urged the gov­ern­ment yes­ter­day to put Met­ro­pol­i­tan Manila and the sur­round­ing towns back on lock­down for at least two weeks.</p>
    <p>“The health sec­tor can­not hold the line for much longer,” they said in a let­ter to Pres­i­dent Ro­drigo Duterte that was signed by the heads of some 40 med­i­cal so­ci­eties.</p>
    <p>“Our health­care sys­tem has been over­whelmed. We are wag­ing a los­ing bat­tle against Covid-19 and we need to draw up a con­sol­i­dated, de­fin­i­tive plan of ac­tion,” they said.</p>
    <p>The groups called for a half­month “time­out” from Aug 1, so that the gov­ern­ment and the health sec­tor could draw up a bet­ter plan to deal with the coron­avirus cri­sis.</p>
    <p>Cur­rent plans are not work­ing, they in­sisted, cit­ing a surge of over 50,000 in­fec­tions in the past month alone.</p>
    <p>The Health Min­istry re­ported 4,963 new cases yes­ter­day, in what was the country’s largest sin­gle-day in­crease of new coron­avirus cases on record.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day’s tally brought the country’s caseload to 98,232. Over 50,000 cases were recorded in July alone, when many of the sweep­ing shel­ter-at-home re­stric­tions in place since May were eased to restart a stalled econ­omy.</p>
    <p>De­spite the surge, Mr Duterte has de­cided to stay the course un­til the mid­dle of this month.</p>
    <p>Last Wed­nes­day, a task force co­or­di­nat­ing ef­forts to roll back the out­break al­lowed gyms, In­ter­net cafes, tu­to­rial and re­view cen­tres, pet clin­ics and drive-in cin­e­mas to re­open. Move­ment re­stric­tions for chil­dren and the el­derly re­main but busi­ness op­er­a­tions – from restau­rants to gyms – can pro­ceed, al­beit in a more lim­ited way.</p>
    <p>The Os­pi­tal ng Maynila, one of the big­gest pub­lic hos­pi­tals in the cap­i­tal, told ABS-CBN News it had been see­ing “four to six DOAs (dead on ar­rival cases)” each day, as the num­ber of pa­tients des­per­ate to be ad­mit­ted surged in the last two weeks of July.</p>
    <p>Dr Karl Laqui, the hos­pi­tal’s of­fi­cer in charge, said that nearly a dozen of the hos­pi­tal’s own staff, many of whom had no con­tact with in­fected pa­tients, were now down with Covid-19.</p>
    <p>The med­i­cal groups said in their let­ter to Mr Duterte that many health pro­fes­sion­als are re­sign­ing “be­cause of fear, fa­tigue and poor work­ing con­di­tions”.</p>
    <p>They called for a “com­pre­hen­sive, ex­ten­sive plan” to con­tain the out­break and for the Health Depart­ment to take the lead.</p>
    <p>A task force over­see­ing ef­forts to slow the spread of Covid-19 is be­ing led by a for­mer mil­i­tary gen­eral.</p>
    <p>They noted the poor im­ple­men­ta­tion of case find­ing and iso­la­tion strate­gies, fail­ure of the Health Depart­ment to con­duct proper con­tact trac­ing, lack of trans­port and work safety pro­ce­dures, and poor pub­lic com­pli­ance with health safety mea­sures.</p>
    <p>“Con­tact trac­ing is fail­ing mis­er­ably,” they said, point­ing out that while guide­lines ex­ist, “com­pli­ance (by lo­cal gov­ern­ment of­fi­cials) is op­tional”.</p>
    <p>“The pro­gres­sive lift­ing of quar­an­tine has in­ad­ver­tently fu­elled pub­lic mis­con­cep­tion that the pan­demic is get­ting bet­ter. It is not,” they added.</p>
    <p>Mr Duterte’s spokesman Harry Roque said in re­sponse that “the strict lock­down in Metro Manila has served its pur­pose and we need to in­ten­sify other strate­gies”.</p>
    <p>“Com­mu­nity quar­an­tine alone, we re­peat, is an in­suf­fi­cient re­sponse in con­trol­ling Covid-19,” he said, adding that the gov­ern­ment is hir­ing more health­care work­ers to scale up hos­pi­tal ca­pac­ity.</p>
    <p>This call from health pro­fes­sion­als came just a day after Mr Duterte promised a vac­cine by De­cem­ber, say­ing he is con­fi­dent the sit­u­a­tion would be back to nor­mal by then.</p>
