    <p>A fu­neral worker has in­curred the wrath of Ar­gen­tini­ans after pho­tos that went vi­ral on so­cial me­dia showed that the man had taken a selfie with the corpse of Diego Maradona.</p>
    <p>The Ar­gentina foot­ball leg­end died aged 60 on Wed­nes­day after suf­fer­ing a heart at­tack.</p>
    <p>Diego Molina – who was fired by the Se­pe­lios Pinier fu­neral par­lour once the pic­tures were leaked – had been tasked, along with his col­leagues, to pre­pare his body for a pri­vate open-cof­fin wake.</p>
    <p>That wake was open only to fam­ily and friends, and took place be­fore the pub­lic state fu­neral, with Maradona just the sec­ond non­pres­i­dent after For­mula One great Juan Manuel Fan­gio to re­ceive such an hon­our.</p>
    <p>How­ever, Molina des­e­crated the 1986 World Cup win­ner’s body by pos­ing for a photo with his hand rest­ing on Maradona’s fore­head and show­ing the thumbs-up sign.</p>
    <p>Two of his col­leagues – one of them did the same thumbs-up ges­ture – also posed for pic­tures, in­vok­ing widespread re­vul­sion.</p>
    <p>Maradona’s lawyer Ma­tias Morla called out Molina, vow­ing to take le­gal ac­tion and tweet­ing: “This is the author of the photo taken be­side Maradona’s cof­fin.</p>
    <p>“He’s Pinier’s head of buri­als. Diego Molina is the swine that took the pic­ture of him­self along­side Maradona. For the mem­ory of my friend, I’m not go­ing to rest un­til he pays for this atroc­ity.”</p>
    <p>Death threats have since been is­sued against Molina, with one ne­ti­zen tweet­ing: “I want this fat baldie who took a pic­ture of him­self by Diego’s body dead. I want him dead. DEAD.”</p>
    <p>Diego Pi­con, the man­ager of the fu­neral home, on Thurs­day apol­o­gised on lo­cal TV chan­nel TN, but claimed Molina and the other two work­ers were “out­sourced em­ploy­ees”.</p>
    <p>“My father is 75 years old and he is cry­ing, I am cry­ing, my brother too, we are de­stroyed,” he said.</p>
    <p>“He is not an em­ployee here, he is a third party who only helped us load the cof­fin... The fam­ily chose a cedar box that is very dif­fi­cult to trans­port and that is why we sum­moned him, just to carry the box.”</p>
