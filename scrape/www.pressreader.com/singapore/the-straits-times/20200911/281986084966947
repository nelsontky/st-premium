    <p>A 13-year-old sec­ondary school stu­dent suf­fered a cut on his nose that needed stitches af­ter his fenc­ing coach flung her mo­bile phone at him and it struck his face.</p>
    <p>The court heard that at the time, free­lance coach Chan Shi­han was an­gry with the boy for not lis­ten­ing to her in­struc­tions.</p>
    <p>She then tossed the de­vice in his di­rec­tion, ex­pect­ing it to hit a fenc­ing mask nearby.</p>
    <p>The phone missed its tar­get and struck the boy in­stead.</p>
    <p>De­tails about the stu­dent and his school can­not be re­vealed due to his age.</p>
    <p>Chan was fined $2,000 yes­ter­day af­ter plead­ing guilty to one count of caus­ing hurt by com­mit­ting a rash act.</p>
    <p>The 27-year-old Sin­ga­porean, who worked for Blade Club Singapore, was at the boy’s school to teach a fenc­ing class on Feb 20 last year.</p>
    <p>The class had stopped for a short break at around 5pm. And Chan was ask­ing the stu­dents to gather about 20 min­utes later for the next part of her les­son when she no­ticed the boy sit­ting down.</p>
    <p>Deputy Pub­lic Prose­cu­tor Ken­neth Kee said: “At the time, the vic­tim was tired and was not pay­ing at­ten­tion to the ac­cused’s in­struc­tions.</p>
    <p>“The ac­cused called out to the vic­tim and asked him to get up but he re­fused to do so, while hit­ting his mask, which was on the floor, with his fenc­ing blade in­stead.”</p>
    <p>An­noyed, Chan threw her mo­bile phone in the boy’s di­rec­tion and it hit his face, wound­ing his nose. She rushed for­ward to ad­min­is­ter first aid to stop the bleed­ing and told the teacher in charge of fenc­ing about what had hap­pened.</p>
    <p>The boy was taken to KK Women’s and Chil­dren’s Hos­pi­tal where the wound was stitched up.</p>
    <p>Chan, who fol­lowed him there, later apol­o­gised to his mother.</p>
    <p>DPP Kee said that the boy’s mother alerted the po­lice to the in­ci­dent the next day.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, the court heard that Blade Club Singapore has since set­tled the boy’s med­i­cal bill of around $130.</p>
    <p>For caus­ing hurt by com­mit­ting a rash act, an of­fender can be jailed for up to a year and fined up to $5,000.</p>
