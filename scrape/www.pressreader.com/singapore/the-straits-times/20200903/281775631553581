    <p>MFA said that For­eign Minister Vi­vian Balakr­ish­nan and his South Korean coun­ter­part Kang Kyung-wha spoke on the phone yes­ter­day, with both wel­com­ing the con­clu­sion of the fast-lane talks.</p>
    <p>It said the min­is­ters also reaf­firmed the im­por­tance of bi­lat­eral co­op­er­a­tion to jointly over­come both coun­tries’ com­mon chal­lenges amid the Covid-19 pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore and South Korea have con­cluded a fast-lane ar­range­ment which will al­low for es­sen­tial busi­ness and of­fi­cial travel between the two coun­tries from to­mor­row.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore’s Min­istry of For­eign Af­fairs (MFA) said yes­ter­day that the ar­range­ment will help re­store con­nec­tiv­ity and sup­port eco­nomic re­cov­ery. It added that the necessary pub­lic health safe­guards will be in place.</p>
    <p>El­i­gi­ble trav­ellers will have to abide by the mu­tu­ally agreed terms and pre­vail­ing pub­lic health mea­sures in both coun­tries.</p>
    <p>These con­di­tions in­clude pre-de­par­ture and post-ar­rival test­ing, as well as the need to ad­here to a con­trolled itin­er­ary for the first 14 days af­ter their ar­rival.</p>
    <p>More de­tails about the fast-lane ar­range­ment and ap­pli­ca­tion process will be pub­lished on the safe­travel.ica.gov.sg web­site by to­mor­row.</p>

    <p>This the sec­ond fast lane Sin­ga­pore has an­nounced in as many days, af­ter a pact with Brunei was an­nounced on Tues­day.</p>
    <p>The Repub­lic has also agreed on fast-lane ar­range­ments with China and Malaysia since it started to grad­u­ally re­open its bor­ders in June.</p>
    <p>Sep­a­rately, it has uni­lat­er­ally opened its bor­ders to short-term visi­tors, in­clud­ing tourists, from Brunei and New Zealand. The ap­pli­ca­tion win­dow to come into Sin­ga­pore un­der this scheme opened on Tues­day.</p>
    <p>These mea­sures are part of ef­forts to grad­u­ally re­vive the lo­cal avi­a­tion sec­tor amid the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Changi Air­port reg­is­tered just 86,000 pas­sen­gers pass­ing through in July, a 98.5 per cent drop com­pared with the same pe­riod last year.</p>
    <p>Air­lines and air­ports world­wide are con­tin­u­ing to strug­gle as well.</p>
    <p>In­dus­try group In­ter­na­tional Air Trans­port As­so­ci­a­tion said on Tues­day that in­ter­na­tional traf­fic in July was 91.9 per cent below the lev­els last year. It added that there is deep in­dus­try frus­tra­tion with gov­ern­ment poli­cies, such as travel re­stric­tions, which are con­tin­u­ing to “an­ni­hi­late” travel de­mand.</p>
    <p>Its di­rec­tor-gen­eral and chief ex­ec­u­tive Alexan­dre de Ju­niac said: “Too many gov­ern­ments are fight­ing a global pan­demic in iso­la­tion with a view that clos­ing bor­ders is the only so­lu­tion.</p>
    <p>“It’s time for gov­ern­ments to work together to im­ple­ment mea­sures that will en­able eco­nomic and so­cial life to re­sume, while con­trol­ling the spread of the virus.”</p>
