    <p>BHAGALPUR (In­dia) • Guards armed with ri­fles es­cort Dr Ku­mar Gau­rav as he makes the rounds at his hos­pi­tal on the banks of the Ganges River.</p>
    <p>The guards are there to pro­tect him from the rel­a­tives of pa­tients, in­clud­ing those suf­fer­ing from Covid-19.</p>
    <p>The rel­a­tives keep barg­ing into the wards, even the in­ten­sive care unit (ICU), to stroke and feed their loved ones, of­ten with­out wear­ing even the flim­si­est of masks as bar­ri­ers against the novel coro­n­avirus.</p>
    <p>“If we stop them, they get an­gry,” Dr Gau­rav says. “They want to give home­made meals to their pa­tients, and some even want to mas­sage their pa­tients. And they are tak­ing the in­fec­tions from our ICUs to the other peo­ple in the so­ci­ety.”</p>
    <p>He stops to tell the wife of a pa­tient in the ICU she must leave. She obeys, only to re­turn after a few min­utes from another en­trance.</p>
    <p>It is the mon­soon sea­son, and the hu­mid­ity is reach­ing un­bear­able lev­els.</p>
    <p>But the few air-con­di­tion­ers in the hos­pi­tal are not work­ing, and some rel­a­tives use hand fans to keep their loved ones cool in wards dirty with garbage and dis­carded pro­tec­tive equip­ment.</p>
    <p>It was not sup­posed to be like this for Dr Gau­rav.</p>
    <p>Nine years ago, the 42-year-old psy­chi­a­trist moved his fam­ily back to his home town for a qui­eter life and bet­ter pay after three years in the In­dian cap­i­tal, New Delhi.</p>
    <p>He ac­cepted a job as a med­i­cal pro­fes­sor and con­sul­tant psy­chi­a­trist at the 900-bed Jawa­har­lal Nehru Med­i­cal Col­lege and Hos­pi­tal, named after In­dia’s first prime min­is­ter.</p>
    <p>Life was un­event­ful but re­ward­ing, spent teach­ing classes and vis­it­ing his psy­chi­a­try pa­tients.</p>
    <p>Now, with some doc­tors struck down by the coro­n­avirus and oth­ers re­fus­ing to work, he has been named the top of­fi­cial at the hos­pi­tal, de­spite be­ing one of its most ju­nior con­sul­tants – and suf­fer­ing from di­a­betes and hy­per­ten­sion, two risk fac­tors for se­vere Covid-19.</p>
    <p>But he says he felt com­pelled to vol­un­teer for the job. “A lot of my col­leagues re­fused,” he says. “I had to take up the re­spon­si­bil­ity.”</p>
    <p>In April, as the pan­demic struck here in the east­ern state of Bi­har, the hos­pi­tal was se­lected as one of just four Covid-ded­i­cated hospi­tals for a pop­u­la­tion of 100 mil­lion peo­ple – at least in the­ory.</p>
    <p>In prac­tice, Dr Gau­rav says, the near­est hos­pi­tal with proper crit­i­cal-care fa­cil­i­ties is around 200km away.</p>
    <p>And with proper health­care in the sur­round­ing ru­ral ar­eas dif­fi­cult to find, gen­eral pa­tients have nowhere else to go but his hos­pi­tal.</p>
    <p>In June, Dr Gau­rav says, the district ad­min­is­tra­tion in­structed the hos­pi­tal to treat un­in­fected pa­tients, too.</p>
    <p>“In an ideal world, there should not be any non-Covid pa­tients in this hos­pi­tal,” Dr Gau­rav says.</p>
    <p>The health­care sys­tem in Bhagalpur, like in many other parts of Bi­har, is on the verge of col­lapse, he says.</p>
    <p>In­ter­views with dozens of staff, pa­tients and rel­a­tives at the hos­pi­tal paint a pic­ture of con­di­tions that might shock those ac­cus­tomed to im­ages of her­met­i­cally sealed ICUs dur­ing the pan­demic, with rel­a­tives not even al­lowed to touch their dy­ing loved ones.</p>
    <p>They tell of a chronic short­age of man­power and re­sources such as blood and medicine.</p>
    <p>All 37 beds in the ICU are oc­cu­pied. On the floor next to one of the beds, a rel­a­tive sits on a brightly coloured blan­ket he has brought from home, a water bot­tle by his side.</p>
    <p>Dr Gau­rav says he feels pow­er­less to pre­vent the lapses in iso­la­tion of the Covid-19 pa­tients.</p>
    <p>“We don’t know who is pos­i­tive and who is neg­a­tive,” the psy­chi­a­trist says. “We don’t know their sta­tus and we can­not wait for them to be tested. They just need the treat­ment. We are the most vul­ner­a­ble pop­u­la­tion.”</p>
    <p>Spokes­men for In­dia’s fed­eral gov­ern­ment and the Bi­har gov­ern­ment, as well as sev­eral bu­reau­crats and min­is­ters re­spon­si­ble for health­care at fed­eral and state level, did not re­spond to de­tailed re­quests for com­ment.</p>
    <p>Bhagalpur district’s top bu­reau­crat Pranav Ku­mar also did not re­spond to a re­quest for com­ment.</p>
    <p>TROU­BLED STATE</p>
    <p>As in­fec­tions slow in many other coun­tries, In­dia is still re­port­ing more than 50,000 cases per day.</p>
    <p>Its to­tal of more than two mil­lion cases trails only the United States and Brazil, and cases show no signs of slow­ing. Since the pan­demic struck In­dia, more than 46,000 peo­ple have died.</p>
    <p>Although In­dia’s ma­jor ci­ties, such as New Delhi and Mum­bai – the first to be hit by the virus – have reg­is­tered a de­cline in cases, num­bers in sec­ond-tier ci­ties and ru­ral ar­eas con­tinue to rise.</p>
    <p>Bi­har is In­dia’s third-most-pop­u­lous state. If it were a coun­try, it would be the 14th-most-pop­u­lous in the world.</p>
    <p>The state has a rich history, in­clud­ing the site where Bud­dha is said to have at­tained en­light­en­ment be­neath the shade of a Bodhi tree.</p>
    <p>But to­day, Bi­har has a rep­u­ta­tion as one of In­dia’s prob­lem-plagued states.</p>
    <p>Based on in­di­ca­tors in­clud­ing in­fant nutri­tion, Bi­har’s level of de­vel­op­ment has more in com­mon with sub-Sa­ha­ran Africa than In­dia’s pros­per­ous south­ern states.</p>
    <p>Al­most half of chil­dren un­der five in the state are stunted from mal­nu­tri­tion, with more than four in 10 un­der­weight for their age, ac­cord­ing to fed­eral data.</p>
    <p>Bi­har also has the high­est pop­u­la­tion growth in In­dia, and one of the worst ed­u­ca­tion sys­tems, scor­ing poorly on in­di­ca­tors in­clud­ing adult lit­er­acy, the per­cent­age of chil­dren at­tend­ing school and exam re­sults.</p>
    <p>The health­care sys­tem was over­bur­dened even be­fore the pan­demic struck.</p>
    <p>Dr Sunil Ku­mar, the Bi­har sec­re­tary of the In­dian Med­i­cal As­so­ci­a­tion – the main health­care union in In­dia – says more than half the doc­tors’ posts in the state are un­filled.</p>
    <p>That is be­cause many doc­tors do not want to serve in ru­ral ar­eas, ac­cord­ing to Bi­har’s top court, which urged the state gov­ern­ment to do more to fill the roles in a rul­ing in May.</p>
    <p>There have been around 87,000 con­firmed cases of the coro­n­avirus in the state and 465 deaths – rel­a­tively small com­pared with other states. Given the low test­ing lev­els in the state, the num­bers may be con­ser­va­tive.</p>
    <p>Still, Bi­har’s health­care sys­tem is al­ready close to break­ing point, un­like places such as New Delhi, which has had many more cases but en­joys bet­ter re­sources.</p>
    <p>The state gov­ern­ment’s re­sponse to the out­break has prompted pub­lic in­ter­est lit­i­ga­tion ask­ing that In­dia’s fed­eral gov­ern­ment, led by Prime Min­is­ter Naren­dra Modi, take over man­age­ment of the pan­demic here.</p>
    <p>One case, filed by lo­cal busi­ness­man Aditya Jalan, says “in­cal­cu­la­ble” lives will be lost if ac­tion is not taken soon, es­pe­cially with the pan­demic spread­ing into less de­vel­oped and more ru­ral ar­eas.</p>
    <p>His pe­ti­tion cites a “com­plete break­down of the pub­lic health in­fra­struc­ture in the state of Bi­har, in­clud­ing the lack of Covid-19 hospi­tals, the lack of hos­pi­tal beds, in­suf­fi­cient test­ing, un­san­i­tary quar­an­tine cen­tres, the lack of en­force­ment of so­cial dis­tanc­ing mea­sures, in­suf­fi­cient med­i­cal per­son­nel, the fail­ure to pro­vide PPE (per­sonal pro­tec­tive equip­ment) to front-line work­ers”.</p>
    <p>In­dia’s Supreme Court was due to hear the case last Fri­day.</p>
    <p>The state’s health­care prob­lems are par­tic­u­larly stark in ru­ral Bi­har, where gov­ern­ment in­fra­struc­ture is even more rudi­men­tary.</p>
    <p>In Is­mailpur, a vil­lage an hour’s drive from Bhagalpur, the on­go­ing an­nual floods have cut off the main road to the high­way.</p>
    <p>The flood wa­ters have reached the doorstep of the di­lap­i­dated pri­mary health cen­tre there, which caters to more than 52,000 peo­ple.</p>
    <p>There are no beds or oxy­gen cylin­ders, and a dog and her lit­ter rest on the dis­carded PPE kits in the cor­ner of the coro­n­avirus test­ing hall.</p>
    <p>“It’s a very back­ward area,” says one of the two doc­tors in the cen­tre, Dr Rakesh Ran­jan.</p>
    <p>“Peo­ple are scared to even get tested. We have to some­times take po­lice to get peo­ple tested.”</p>
    <p>HOS­PI­TAL CHAOS</p>
    <p>Psy­chi­a­trist Gau­rav’s hos­pi­tal backs onto the Ganges River, the holi­est in In­dia and swollen by the sum­mer mon­soon.</p>
    <p>Next to water buf­faloes bathing on the banks, pri­vate am­bu­lance op­er­a­tors wash their ve­hi­cles with clank­ing buck­ets.</p>
    <p>On the ap­proach road to the hos­pi­tal, there is a huge pot­hole, and ve­hi­cles car­ry­ing pa­tients of­ten get stuck there.</p>
    <p>Out­side the main doors, rel­a­tives sit with the bodies of their loved ones wait­ing for pri­vate am­bu­lances to take them for burial or cre­ma­tion.</p>
    <p>The work­ers who push the trol­leys car­ry­ing in­com­ing pa­tients to the gen­eral emer­gency wards do not know the history of the new ar­rivals, most of whom have not yet been tested for the virus.</p>
    <p>Of­ten wear­ing only gloves as pro­tec­tive gear, the work­ers wheel them in­side, take their oxy­gen lev­els and leave them on trol­leys in the cor­ri­dor, where some peo­ple are treated un­til they can find a bed.</p>
    <p>In the cor­ri­dor, an ex­hausted woman rests her head on a wall as her hus­band’s blood sam­ple is col­lected while he lies on a stretcher next to her.</p>
    <p>In­side one of the emer­gency wards, a woman drags her hus­band from a stretcher to his bed as their rel­a­tive holds an in­tra­venous in­fu­sion bot­tle.</p>
    <p>Dr Gau­rav tries to be vis­i­ble, tour­ing the wards to mo­ti­vate pa­tients and staff.</p>
    <p>But it is a game of con­stant men­tal arith­metic.</p>
    <p>Pa­tients ex­pect to be seen by a se­nior doc­tor, but it is not al­ways pos­si­ble.</p>
    <p>“If I stand in front of a Covid-19 pa­tient for two min­utes, and I see 20 pa­tients, I have ex­po­sure for 40 min­utes,” Dr Gau­rav says.</p>
    <p>With so few doc­tors, that kind of ex­po­sure is a risk he can­not of­ten af­ford to take.</p>
    <p>Com­plaints from ju­nior doc­tors are con­stant.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing one meet­ing about a lack of medicine, Dr Gau­rav prom­ises them he will con­vince the gov­ern­ment that more re­sources are needed.</p>
    <p>He later ad­mits it will be dif­fi­cult. He weeps as he de­scribes his worst mo­ment since he took over, when a friend of his fa­ther who needs blood trans­fu­sions at reg­u­lar in­ter­vals asked for help.</p>
    <p>“I had to say ‘no’, as we don’t have enough blood in the bank.</p>
    <p>“We have just a min­i­mum for emer­gen­cies,” Dr Gau­rav says. He finds such re­fusals painful. “I don’t know how to say ‘no’ to a pa­tient.”</p>
    <p>COM­ING HOME</p>
    <p>Born i n Bhagalpur, Dr Gau­rav moved to the north­ern city of Chandi­garh for his med­i­cal train­ing, where he met his wife Mili Jaswal, a psy­chol­o­gist.</p>
    <p>After mar­ry­ing, the young cou­ple moved to New Delhi, where they adopted a street dog, Faith.</p>
    <p>Dr Gau­rav worked in a pri­vate hos­pi­tal but could not han­dle the cul­ture.</p>
    <p>“Their ori­en­ta­tion is how much fi­nan­cially you can give back to them,” he says. “It’s dif­fi­cult for a doc­tor to work this.”</p>
    <p>And so in 2011, Dr Gau­rav, Ms Jaswal and Faith boarded a train back to Bi­har.</p>
    <p>“Fi­nan­cial se­cu­rity was a big fac­tor, and I had my fam­ily here,” Dr Gau­rav says.</p>
    <p>His six-year-old daugh­ter Iti Swara was born a few years later. He dotes on her.</p>
    <p>He re­cently had his two-bed­room gov­ern­ment bun­ga­low painted pink in­side and out at her re­quest.</p>
    <p>But these days, the hugs he gives his daugh­ter each morning be­fore he goes to work have changed. Now, he has fear on his mind, not love.</p>
    <p>Ms Jaswal wor­ries that the long hours and stress of Dr Gau­rav’s work are tak­ing him away from their daugh­ter.</p>
    <p>“When he is home, she wants to speak to him, but he can’t,” she says. “She wants to share her thoughts and play with him, but he is not able to.”</p>
    <p>Dr Gau­rav watched cases in the district slowly rise over a num­ber of months, but the call to take over the run­ning of the hos­pi­tal last month came sud­denly.</p>
    <p>The pre­vi­ous hos­pi­tal su­per­in­ten­dent had tested pos­i­tive for the virus, and to Dr Gau­rav’s sur­prise, he says, some of the more se­nior doc­tors re­fused the post.</p>
    <p>At­tempts to get com­ment from the doc­tors were un­suc­cess­ful, but lower-rank­ing doc­tors at the hos­pi­tal con­firmed Dr Gau­rav’s ac­count, and an of­fi­cial let­ter from the pre­vi­ous su­per­in­ten­dent cited one of the re­fusals.</p>
    <p>Dr Gau­rav thought about his ex­tended fam­ily, whom he stopped vis­it­ing as the virus be­gan to spread through the district.</p>
    <p>Who would run the hos­pi­tal if they were ad­mit­ted, if not him?</p>
    <p>“For the peo­ple of Bhagalpur and nearby dis­tricts, it was my re­spon­si­bil­ity,” he says.</p>
    <p>“That is why I raised my hand.”</p>
    <p>A PA­TIENT WAITS</p>
    <p>Fear of the virus – and anger at the lack of re­sources – also haunts the pa­tients and their rel­a­tives.</p>
    <p>One Sunday last month, Mr Parsada Sah, a gaunt, 67-year-old shop­keeper, tested pos­i­tive for the coro­n­avirus in a vil­lage 50km from Bhagalpur.</p>
    <p>Mr Sah, along with his wife Vimla Devi and son Manoj, reached the hos­pi­tal in an am­bu­lance that after­noon.</p>
    <p>Manoj showed his fa­ther’s pos­i­tive test to the doc­tor on duty.</p>
    <p>He says he was told there were no beds in Covid-19 wards, and was asked to find him­self a bed in an al­ready over­crowded 20-bed gen­eral emer­gency ward.</p>
    <p>“We were told that this is the only place we can have for now, as there is no space,” Manoj says. “We pleaded with them a lot. They told me that every­one wants a bed.”</p>
    <p>Even though they know Mr Sah is in­fected, the fam­ily goes in­side the ward to feed him.</p>
    <p>“The staff just put the food on the bed; they don’t feed any­one,” Manoj says.</p>
    <p>“If the pa­tient can’t eat by him­self, he has to get some­one to help.”</p>
    <p>Dr Gau­rav says their con­cerns are gen­uine.</p>
    <p>“We don’t have sep­a­rate staff for tak­ing pa­tients to wash­rooms or feed them,” he says. “The prob­lem is, we don’t have enough hu­man re­sources, from bot­tom to top.”</p>
    <p>BEAR­ING WEIGHT</p>
    <p>Even­tu­ally, al­most a day later, a bed is found for Mr Sah in the iso­la­tion ward.</p>
    <p>When he is moved, Mr Sameer, a 22-year-old med­i­cal at­ten­dant sent to help with the trans­fer, hur­riedly changes into his plas­tic over­alls.</p>
    <p>In­stead of pro­tec­tive gog­gles, he uses a pair of cheap sun­glasses. He ges­tures to his over­alls.</p>
    <p>“We only get these once we are mov­ing pos­i­tive pa­tients from the gen­eral ward to a Covid-19 ward.”</p>
    <p>Oth­er­wise, he says, “we are the first peo­ple to re­ceive a pa­tient as they en­ter the gate, but we don’t have any pro­tec­tion”.</p>
    <p>After col­lect­ing an oxy­gen tank for the trans­fer, and fid­dling with the cylin­der for a few min­utes in­side the ward, Mr Sameer and his col­league dis­cover that it is faulty.</p>
    <p>They take a new one, but the rusted trol­ley they mount it on barely moves.</p>
    <p>It screeches as the men try to drag it through the hos­pi­tal cor­ri­dors.</p>
    <p>The tube at­tached to Mr Sah’s oxy­gen mask strains as Mr Sameer tries to keep pace with the stretcher, with the man’s wife and son trail­ing be­hind.</p>
    <p>Even­tu­ally, the wheels of the trol­ley stop turn­ing al­to­gether.</p>
    <p>So Mr Sameer hoists the hulk­ing can­is­ter onto his shoul­ders, and bears the weight him­self.</p>
    <p>Although In­dia’s ma­jor ci­ties have reg­is­tered a de­cline in cases, num­bers in sec­ond-tier ci­ties and ru­ral ar­eas con­tinue to rise. Bi­har is In­dia’s third-most-pop­u­lous state. If it were a coun­try, it would be the 14th-most-pop­u­lous in the world.</p>
    <p>Dr Ku­mar Gau­rav weeps as he de­scribes his worst mo­ment since he took over, when a friend of his fa­ther who needs blood trans­fu­sions at reg­u­lar in­ter­vals asked for help. “I had to say ‘no’, as we don’t have enough blood in the bank. We have just a min­i­mum for emer­gen­cies.”</p>
