    <p>• In what could be a sil­ver lin­ing for the re­turn of con­certs, Man­dopop star Eric Chou has held the first post-pan­demic, full-scale arena shows in Tai­wan – draw­ing 33,000 at­ten­dees.</p>
    <p>The shows, held at Taipei Arena last Satur­day and Sun­day, drew 11,000 and 22,000 con­cert­go­ers re­spec­tively.</p>
    <p>The 25-year-old Tai­wanese singer per­formed songs such as That’s All, Free­dom and At Least I Re­mem­ber on a re­volv­ing stage.</p>
    <p>He re­leased his fifth and latest al­bum, When We Were Young, in Jan­uary.</p>
    <p>Ella Chen from girl group S.H.E, was a guest per­former at the show, which was at­tended by celebri­ties such as Tai­wanese singers Ben Wu and Dino Lee.</p>
    <p>The show also fea­tured a video mes­sage from Hong Kong singer G.E.M, his duet part­ner on the hit song Don’t Force It, as well as an ap­pear­ance by his pet dog Chopin.</p>
    <p>Tai­wan has been praised for its highly ef­fec­tive Covid-19 re­sponse, with 481 con­firmed cases and seven deaths in a pop­u­la­tion of 23.7 mil­lion, ac­cord­ing to me­dia re­ports.</p>
    <p>Safety mea­sures ob­served at the con­certs ap­proved by the Tai­wanese au­thor­i­ties in­cluded manda­tory masks for all at­ten­dees, ac­cess to hand sani­tis­ers and tem­per­a­ture checks, and re­fus­ing en­try to ticket hold­ers with a tem­per­a­ture higher than 37.5 deg C.</p>
    <p>Chou is set to per­form two more arena shows on Sept 5 and 6 at the Kaoh­si­ung Arena.</p>
