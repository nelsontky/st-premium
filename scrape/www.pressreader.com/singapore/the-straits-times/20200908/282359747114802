    <p>Theatre prac­ti­tioner Peter Sau, 44, would like to see a restag­ing of Romeo And Juliet where Juliet is in a wheel­chair, Romeo has a stump for his arm and the nurse has Down syn­drome.</p>
    <p>“I’d like to see how these dif­fer­ent char­ac­ters can be em­bod­ied and per­formed by dis­abled ac­tors. That kind of rep­re­sen­ta­tion is go­ing to be very multi-lay­ered,” says the founder of Project Tan­dem, a theatre col­lec­tive for artists with dis­abil­i­ties.</p>
    <p>On the wider topic of ac­cess, he adds: “Artists from main­stream con­texts should strive to cre­ate new ‘lan­guages’ to reach out to more au­di­ences. Not just the spo­ken l an­guage, but to really in­te­grate the spo­ken, phys­i­cal, sen­so­rial and the vis­ual to be more sen­si­tively wo­ven to­gether.”</p>
    <p>Mr Sau, who is also an ed­u­ca­tor, is one of sev­eral Sin­ga­pore­ans who will be speak­ing at next month’s Arts & Dis­abil­ity Fo­rum.</p>
    <p>The event, which will run from Oct 7 to 9, is or­gan­ised by the Na­tional Arts Coun­cil and char­ity Very Spe­cial Arts Sin­ga­pore, and will fea­ture more than 10 speak­ers from dif­fer­ent coun­tries.</p>
    <p>It will be set to the theme Cul­ti­vat­ing Col­lab­o­ra­tions, In­creas­ing Ac­cess; and con­sist of key­note pre­sen­ta­tions, panel dis­cus­sions and work­shops.</p>
    <p>Due to the pan­demic, the event will be held on­line for the first time since its launch in 2015. The or­gan­is­ers ex­pect more than 300 peo­ple from Sin­ga­pore and abroad to take part.</p>
    <p>Mr Sau and his fel­low Sin­ga­pore speak­ers – artist and re­searcher Dawn-joy Leong, 55; and theatre ac­tor and singer Claire Teo, 20 – spoke to The Straits Times last week af­ter film­ing and record­ing them­selves for a pre­sen­ta­tion that will ac­com­pany their panel dis­cus­sion.</p>
    <p>They have been en­cour­aged to au­dio-de­scribe ev­ery pic­to­rial Pow­erPoint slide, Mr Sau says, adding that the au­dio de­scrip­tion is not hid­den, but au­di­ble for ev­ery­one.</p>
    <p>Dr Leong, who is autis­tic, chimes in: “I think this should be the new nor­mal – when you don’t have to press a but­ton to get your ac­cess.</p>
    <p>“It is all there: live cap­tion­ing, au­dio de­scrip­tion. Then it just be­comes nor­mal. You are in­clu­sive nor­mally.”</p>
    <p>Ms Teo, who is vis­ually im­paired, adds: “Hope­fully one day, the dis­tinc­tion be­tween the dis­abled and the main­stream will no longer be nec­es­sary.”</p>
    <p>The key­note speak­ers at next month’s fo­rum are Bri­tish dance vet­eran Ruth Fabby, artis­tic di­rec­tor of Dis­abil­ity Arts Cymru; and Aus­tralian arts per­former and ed­u­ca­tor Caro­line Bowditch, chief ex­ec­u­tive of Arts Ac­cess Vic­to­ria.</p>
    <p>There will also be dis­cus­sions and hands-on ac­tiv­i­ties led by ex­perts such as Malaysian so­cial en­tre­pre­neur Stevens Chan, who founded in­ter­na­tion­ally renowned arts fes­ti­val Di­a­logue in the Dark; In­dian pho­tog­ra­pher and dis­abil­ity arts prac­ti­tioner Partho Bhowmick, who started the Blind With Cam­era pho­tog­ra­phy school for the vis­ually im­paired; and Sin­ga­pore so­cial ad­vo­cate Jean Loo, co-founder of in­clu­sive arts move­ment Su­per­hero Me.</p>
    <p>In re­cent years, there have been ef­forts to make the arts scene more in­clu­sive. The Ac­cess Arts Hub con­sor­tium was founded in 2018, and more per­form­ing arts groups have been of­fer­ing signed and au­dio-de­scribed shows.</p>
    <p>The Esplanade has pre­sented PLAY­time! – sen­sory-friendly per­for­mances for chil­dren with spe­cial needs – and the Na­tional Gallery Sin­ga­pore has worked with the Dis­abled Peo­ple’s As­so­ci­a­tion and Levelfield Con­sul­tants to pro­duce an on­line ac­cess guide to help peo­ple with dis­abil­i­ties plan vis­its.</p>
    <p>Still, more can be done. Dr Leong would like to see more train­ing sup­port and fund­ing for artists with dis­abil­i­ties – in­clud­ing a sep­a­rate grant ded­i­cated to them.</p>
    <p>Fund­ing is a key con­sid­er­a­tion, not least be­cause of the added costs of im­prov­ing ac­cess – for ex­am­ple, hir­ing ac­cess work­ers to ac­com­pany peo­ple with Down syn­drome to the work­place.</p>
    <p>She adds that there could also be more pro­duc­tions that put peo­ple with dis­abil­i­ties in the driver’s seat or ac­tively en­gage them in the cre­ative process.</p>
    <p>Some­thing About Home, a pan­dis­abil­ity the­atri­cal per­for­mance di­rected by Sau and com­mis­sioned by Na­tional Gallery Sin­ga­pore for the Light to Night fes­ti­val in Jan­uary, was one such show that did this. Both Dr Leong and Ms Teo were in the cast.</p>
    <p>Dr Leong adds: “We are not a char­ity show­case. We are pro­fes­sion­als. And lead­er­ship to­wards that is very im­por­tant.”</p>
