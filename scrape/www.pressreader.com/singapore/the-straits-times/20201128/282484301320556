    <p>Gold prices were yes­ter­day set for a third straight week of de­clines as grow­ing op­ti­mism over a coro­n­avirus vac­cine drove in­vestors into tra­di­tion­ally riskier as­sets and out of the safe-haven metal.</p>
    <p>Spot gold fell 0.2 per cent to US$1,807.86 per ounce in early trad­ing yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>US gold fu­tures were steady at US$1,806. Bul­lion was set to fall 3.3 per cent on the week.</p>
    <p>Asian shares stalled near record highs yes­ter­day as As­traZeneca faces tricky ques­tions about the suc­cess rate of its vac­cine can­di­date that could hin­der its chances of get­ting speedy United States and Euro­pean Union reg­u­la­tory ap­proval.</p>
    <p>“For the mar­kets, I don’t think that (doubts over the ef­fec­tive­ness of a vac­cine) changes the per­cep­tion there’s go­ing to be a vac­cine com­ing sooner than pre­vi­ously ex­pected,” said IG Mar­kets an­a­lyst Kyle Rodda.</p>
    <p>In­vestors are starting to buy into the nar­ra­tive that the eco­nomic re­cov­ery is go­ing to gather steam next year and that is driv­ing in­vestors to liq­ui­date gold hold­ings, he added.</p>
    <p>On the tech­ni­cal front, sup­port for gold re­mains in­tact at US$1,800 an ounce, while sil­ver con­tin­ues to see sup­port­ive in­ter­est near the psy­cho­log­i­cal US$23 level, MKS PAMP said in a note.</p>
    <p>Rais­ing the prospect for fur­ther stim­u­lus, the Euro­pean Cen­tral Bank’s chief econ­o­mist warned that tol­er­at­ing “a longer phase of even lower in­fla­tion” would hurt con­sump­tion and in­vest­ment.</p>
    <p>Gold has gained 19.2 per cent this year, driven by large stim­u­lus mea­sures that raised con­cerns of in­fla­tion, against which the metal is con­sid­ered a hedge.</p>
    <p>“With real in­ter­est rates re­main­ing con­sid­er­ably low, the dol­lar struc­turally weak, and with the up­com­ing se­lec­tion of (Janet) Yellen as the next US Trea­sury Sec­re­tary, the longer-term ap­peal of gold as safe haven would re­main good,” Phillip Fu­tures se­nior com­modi­ties man­ager Av­tar Sandu said.</p>
    <p>Sil­ver fell 1 per cent to US$23.21 per ounce. Plat­inum dropped 0.7 per cent to US$954.93 and pal­la­dium was 0.5 per cent higher at US$2,394.02.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, bit­coin and other dig­i­tal peers stead­ied after post­ing some of the big­gest de­clines since the on­set of the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>A day after tum­bling 9.7 per cent, bit­coin edged higher to US$17,050 at 9.05 am in London. Ethereum was steady at US$514.50, while XRP rose 3 per cent to 53.65 US cents.</p>
    <p>Fears over tighter cryp­tocur­rency reg­u­la­tions and profit-tak­ing after a fre­netic rally were among the rea­sons cited for Thurs­day’s sell-off.</p>
    <p>“After big ral­lies in shares and var­i­ous other as­sets, they are all vul­ner­a­ble to a bit of a pause,” said head of in­vest­ment strat­egy Shane Oliver of AMP Cap­i­tal In­vestors in Syd­ney.</p>
    <p>In­vestors are starting to buy into the nar­ra­tive that the eco­nomic re­cov­ery is go­ing to gather steam next year and that is driv­ing in­vestors to liq­ui­date gold hold­ings.</p>
