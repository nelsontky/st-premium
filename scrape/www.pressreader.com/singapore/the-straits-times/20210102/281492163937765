    <p>Joe Bi­den be­comes US pres­i­dent. Bri­tain enters a post-EU era. China ver­sus the West. Vac­cines and Covid-19’s long shadow. PAP’s po­lit­i­cal tran­si­tion. Re­vised PSLE. The Straits Times looks ahead to the new year and new un­cer­tain­ties.</p>
    <p>• Plus the big events due this year, from the World Eco­nomic Fo­rum in Sin­ga­pore to elec­tions in Ger­many.</p>
    <p>Asians should have a bet­ter sense of where their col­lec­tive des­tinies are headed in a few months from now.</p>
    <p>In less than three weeks, Mr Joe Bi­den, who was vice-pres­i­dent of the United States when Mr Barack Obama fash­ioned the re­bal­ance to Asia, takes charge of the na­tion. At his side will be Amer­ica’s first woman vice-pres­i­dent, who is of Asian and African-Amer­i­can de­scent.</p>
    <p>Known, liked, and with ex­pe­ri­ence so lengthy that if you put him in a room with two dozen Asian lead­ers he will have some­thing in­ter­est­ing and in­formed to say about each of their coun­tries, Mr Bi­den comes bet­ter pre­pared for of­fice than al­most any other Amer­i­can pres­i­dent in a cen­tury.</p>
    <p>China? As a se­na­tor he met the late Deng Xiaop­ing in 1979, and as vicepres­i­dent trav­elled with Mr Xi Jin­ping around China in 2011, and the US the fol­low­ing year.</p>
    <p>We will know soon if that early con­tact, when he and Mr Xi were of roughly equal rank, will play for good or worse. For, un­doubt­edly, Mr Bi­den’s siz­ing up of Mr Xi’s per­son­al­ity back then no doubt con­trib­uted to the Amer­i­can as­sess­ment of the in­com­ing Chi­nese leader.</p>
    <p>If Mr Bi­den feels the af­fa­bil­ity, mod­esty and un­der­stat­ed­ness that Mr Xi dis­played at the time was a clever mask for the man the world would know as China’s leader – con­fi­dent, as­sertive, and with a ten­dency to amass per­sonal and party power – Asia should pre­pare for trou­ble.</p>
    <p>Of course, Pres­i­dent Xi could make some early moves to mit­i­gate the frost; he could call Mr Bi­den and tell him that it is time for a frank con­ver­sa­tion. Mr Bi­den will surely have the pa­tience to hear him out.</p>
    <p>On the other hand, if Mr Xi or­ders some­thing pre­cip­i­tous – say, on Tai­wan dur­ing the pres­i­den­tial tran­si­tion or in the early days of the Bi­den pres­i­dency – it could force Mr Bi­den to re­act in a way that sets ties back decades.</p>
    <p>Mr Bi­den was one of the 90 sen­a­tors who voted in favour of the Tai­wan Re­la­tions Act, which com­mits the US to Tai­wan’s se­cu­rity and the con­tin­u­a­tion of unof­fi­cial US-Tai­wan ties. His leg­isla­tive record shows he has en­dorsed key weapons sales to Tai­wan, which Bei­jing con­sid­ers a break­away ter­ri­tory to be re­turned to the fold, by force if nec­es­sary. And in Jan­uary 2020 when Tai­wanese Pres­i­dent Tsai Ing-wen was re-elected, he was the ear­li­est of the Demo­cratic pres­i­den­tial can­di­dates to con­grat­u­late her.</p>
    <p>When Mr Bi­den en­tered na­tional politics, and the Se­nate For­eign Re­la­tions Com­mit­tee, Europe was the epi­cen­tre of global politics. To­day, at the crest of his long ca­reer, the key the­atre is Asia.</p>
    <p>From a US point of view, he would know that there is lit­tle time to lose. The Re­gional Com­pre­hen­sive Eco­nomic Part­ner­ship (RCEP), though low in am­bi­tion at the mo­ment, is a defin­ing mo­ment for a China-led Asian or­der. The main­land’s near neigh­bours Ja­pan and South Korea are in, and so too is Pa­cific ally Aus­tralia de­spite its own tense trade ties with China.</p>
    <p>Al­though nom­i­nally an Asean-led ini­tia­tive, there is no ques­tion which coun­try dom­i­nates the RCEP group. In­deed, big­ger deals could lie ahead that re­duce Amer­i­can say in Asia’s af­fairs. Al­ready, some very responsibl­e Asean fig­ures are of­fer­ing up the idea of giv­ing China “early har­vest” treat­ment to join the Com­pre­hen­sive and Pro­gres­sive Agree­ment for Trans-Pa­cific Part­ner­ship, the high-qual­ity trade agree­ment that Ja­pan stitched to­gether when Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump pulled the US out from talks on a Trans-Pa­cific Part­ner­ship agree­ment.</p>
    <p>To be sure, how Asia acts, and re­acts, also de­pends on how things pan out in the US.</p>
    <p>Do­mes­ti­cally, un­less Democrats win Ge­or­gia’s two Se­nate run-off elec­tions on Jan 5, Mr Bi­den will be the first pres­i­dent since Mr Ge­orge H.W. Bush to take of­fice with­out his party con­trol­ling both houses of Congress.</p>
    <p>He has more lee­way on for­eign pol­icy. De­spite all the at­ten­tion that Rus­sia and West Asia, or Mid­dle East as he knows it, de­mand, it will be im­pos­si­ble for him to not pri­ori­tise East Asia.</p>
    <p>He will not be dis­ap­pointed with the Asian re­sponse. The re­fined Bi­den per­sona, a de­cided con­trast to Mr Trump, is one that the re­gion will reach for in­stinc­tively, even if at the back of its col­lec­tive mind is the un­spo­ken thought: Is this pres­i­dency go­ing to be Obama 2.0?</p>
    <p>There are par­al­lels. Mr Obama’s hands were full with the global fi</p>
    <p>De­spite all the at­ten­tion that Rus­sia and West Asia, or Mid­dle East as he knows it, de­mand, it will be im­pos­si­ble for Mr Bi­den to not pri­ori­tise East Asia.</p>

    <p>nan­cial cri­sis in the early part of his term; Mr Bi­den has the Covid-19 cri­sis and its fall­out to tackle.</p>
    <p>Un­like in early 2008, how­ever, the US econ­omy had ac­tu­ally been in a strong po­si­tion when Covid-19 hit. The wealth gap was shrink­ing, un­em­ploy­ment was at record lows and even mi­nor­ity com­mu­ni­ties were surf­ing the ris­ing tide nicely.</p>
    <p>Mr Bi­den, how­ever, is for­tu­nate to be tak­ing of­fice just as the vac­cines have ar­rived. An eco­nomic surge pos­si­bly awaits thanks to a sturdy fi­nan­cial ser­vices in­dus­try, im­prove­ments in broad­band in­fra­struc­ture and the emer­gence of a strong phy­gi­tal – phys­i­cal and dig­i­tal – econ­omy.</p>
    <p>The Wall Street Jour­nal re­cently re­ported that there were al­most 1.6 mil­lion new busi­ness ap­pli­ca­tions in the third quar­ter of 2020, up from fewer than 860,000 in the year-ear­lier pe­riod.</p>
    <p>If it all comes to­gether, a buoy­ancy in Amer­ica’s mood is per­haps likely and this will re­ver­ber­ate around the world.</p>
    <p>In­ter­est­ingly, this per­cep­tion of a mini-surge will con­trast with China’s econ­omy, which gained from the coun­try’s ad­mirable re­sponse to con­tain­ing Covid-19, but is show­ing some worry mark­ers.</p>
    <p>Bei­jing has re­port­edly all but hit the pause but­ton on the Belt and Road Ini­tia­tive. Its cen­tral bank has its hands full manag­ing lo­cal gov­ern­ments that can’t pay their debts, Amer­i­can sanc­tions on key com­pa­nies are bit­ing, and find­ing jobs for new grad­u­ates is prov­ing a strug­gle.</p>
    <p>Asia needs to place all of these el­e­ments on the ta­ble and think things through with a cool mind as</p>
    <p>it awaits Mr Bi­den’s moves. It might take a lit­tle longer than it would like.</p>
    <p>Rus­sia, al­ways top of Mr Bi­den’s mind, has come sharply into fo­cus again with the So­larWinds hack­ing that ex­posed a host of US govern­ment de­part­ments. Mr Bi­den needs to fash­ion a re­sponse, and it will have to be a strong one.</p>
    <p>In an el­lip­ti­cal way, this will feed back to Asia through the de­cou­pling im­pulse.</p>
    <p>Even if Mr Bi­den’s own in­stincts may have been against a forced sep­a­ra­tion of Western and Chi­nese tech­nol­ogy sys­tems, Rus­sia’s out­ra­geous acts and its in­creas­ingly close strate­gic ties with Bei­jing will play into the wider per­cep­tion of the col­lec­tive West ver­sus China and its al­lies. The sus­tained cleans­ing and pro­tec­tion of the ar­ter­ies of in­for­ma­tion and data have now be­come a global pri­or­ity.</p>
    <p>Iron­i­cally, de­cou­pling – even if most sea­soned an­a­lysts would con­sider it a fan­ci­ful idea – is set to gather speed at a time when China is sig­nalling more open­ness to the world. Amer­i­can banks such as Citi, law firms es­sen­tial to fi­nan­cial trans­ac­tions such as Baker McKen­zie, and credit card com­pa­nies are see­ing greater op­por­tu­ni­ties to grow in the main­land mar­ket.</p>
    <p>With so much go­ing on, Mr Bi­den will strug­gle to balance pri­or­i­ties. His first in­stinct would be to strengthen al­liances in Europe and Asia, even as he en­cour­ages coun­tries such as Ja­pan and In­dia to do more of the heavy lift­ing on strate­gic is­sues.</p>
    <p>For this rea­son, the “In­dian Ocean fleet” idea spawned in the last leg of the Trump pres­i­dency has a more than even chance of com­ing to pass. A re­cent re­port by the United States In­sti­tute of Peace says the Quadri­lat­eral Se­cu­rity Dia­logue con­sist­ing of Aus­tralia, In­dia, Ja­pan and the US should be made “mil­i­tar­ily ef­fec­tive”.</p>
    <p>In­deed, an eco­nomic di­men­sion to Quad is not un­think­able ei­ther as a counter to China’s at­tempts to use ac­cess to its huge mar­ket as both lure and threat.</p>
    <p>One spin-off from all that Asia needs to watch could be the rise of a strong mil­i­tary and mil­i­tary-in­dus­trial com­plex in Ja­pan, blessed by the US and in­creas­ingly wel­comed by a raft of re­gional states.</p>
    <p>Where Ja­pan goes on grand strat­egy, In­dia will likely not be too far be­hind. Asia’s No. 3 econ­omy is now pro­jected to shrink less than orig­i­nally thought in 2020 and some tail winds are gath­er­ing. New Covid-19 cases have fallen to fewer than one­fifth of their peak and a form of mass im­mu­nity seems pos­si­ble.</p>
    <p>To­gether with Aus­tralia, the three pow­ers, with some key Euro­pean states join­ing in even­tu­ally, will place hem­lines around the re­gion. The sig­nif­i­cant de­vel­op­ment of 2020 was the grow­ing con­ver</p>
    <p>With so much go­ing on, Mr Bi­den will strug­gle to balance pri­or­i­ties. His first in­stinct would be to strengthen al­liances in Europe and Asia, even as he en­cour­ages coun­tries such as Ja­pan and In­dia to do more of the heavy lift­ing on strate­gic is­sues.</p>
    <p>gence in Euro­pean per­spec­tives on China with the Quad na­tions.</p>
    <p>All this is bound to leave large parts of South-east Asia faced with an un­pleas­ant choice: move in a di­rec­tion for which it has no great ap­petite, or risk ir­rel­e­vance if it does not move closer to the other camp.</p>
    <p>Even as RCEP be­comes a re­al­ity once a ma­jor­ity of Asean states and dia­logue part­ners rat­ify it, push­ing the group China’s way, there will be com­pet­ing de­mands to row in the other di­rec­tion.</p>
    <p>Even if sen­ti­ments on the ground may be shift­ing to­wards China in some coun­tries, Asia’s elite does not gen­er­ally buy va­ca­tion homes in China, send chil­dren to univer­sity there, or leave their sav­ings un­der Bei­jing’s su­per­vi­sion.</p>
    <p>While Bei­jing may be tol­er­ant of its neigh­bours hedg­ing, Wash­ing­ton will not be. Even seven decades ago, as the Cold War took shape, the US viewed non­align­ment as “im­moral”. To­day, the US mood is not only less be­nign, but nasty even.</p>
    <p>The ac­tivist Eldridge Cleaver’s say­ing that you are a part of the prob­lem if you are not part of the so­lu­tion is of­ten held as a tem­plate for the way Amer­i­cans think.</p>
    <p>Equally rel­e­vant, how­ever, is his lesser-known ob­ser­va­tion that “there is no calamity that a great na­tion can in­vite which equals that which fol­lows a supine sub­mis­sion to wrong and in­jus­tice and the con­se­quent loss of na­tional self-re­spect and hon­our”.</p>
    <p>When Amer­i­cans view China, this is the sub­lim­i­nal thought in play, never mind that the US it­self may have con­trib­uted to so many of Bei­jing’s in­se­cu­ri­ties. This is also driv­ing the urge to work with Europe to fash­ion com­mon strate­gies.</p>
    <p>US Per­ma­nent Rep­re­sen­ta­tive to Nato Kay Bai­ley Hutchi­son said early last month that Nato is work­ing on us­ing outer space as a “mil­i­tary ca­pa­bil­ity, and cer­tainly, in­tel­li­gence-gath­er­ing” in a clear-eyed build-up for a po­ten­tial ad­ver­sar­ial re­la­tion­ship with China. It was im­por­tant, she said, in or­der “to de­fend our way of life and Western cul­ture... This is not just Amer­ica, but all of us”.</p>
    <p>Willy-nilly, South-east Asians will find their feet be­ing held to this fire. Hard choices await.</p>
