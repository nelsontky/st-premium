    <p>An Im­mi­gra­tion and Check­points Author­ity (ICA) cus­tomer ser­vice of­fi­cer and her daugh­ter re­ceived bribes to­talling $1,500 from a Malaysian woman who wanted her Sin­ga­pore per­ma­nent res­i­dence ap­pli­ca­tion process to be ex­pe­dited.</p>
    <p>The mother, Lucy Teo, 50, was sen­tenced yes­ter­day to 18 weeks’ jail. She pleaded guilty on Mon­day to a cor­rup­tion charge and five counts of ac­cess­ing com­puter data with­out author­ity at the ICA Build­ing in Kal­lang Road.</p>
    <p>A district court heard that ICA sus­pended her on Dec 19, 2018.</p>
    <p>Her daugh­ter, Sharon Loo Wai Woon, 29, who worked as a sales con­sul­tant for a firm called Im­mi­gra­tion So­lu­tions Sin­ga­pore (ISS), was sen­tenced to six weeks’ jail af­ter ad­mit­ting to one count of cor­rup­tion. She must also pay a penalty of $1,500, which was the amount taken in bribes.</p>
    <p>The two Sin­ga­porean women had worked to­gether to ac­cept bribes from Fenny Tey Hui Nee, 25, who be­came a Sin­ga­pore per­ma­nent res­i­dent (PR) on Nov 9, 2018. She was sen­tenced to four weeks’ jail in June over her role in the of­fences.</p>
    <p>Deputy Pub­lic Pros­e­cu­tors Ben Tan and Eric Hu stated in court doc­u­ments that Tey had made in­quiries about ISS’ im­mi­gra­tion con­sul­tancy ser­vices in July 2017 as she wanted to be­come a Sin­ga­pore PR. Loo told her that it would cost $5,000 to en­gage the firm’s ser­vices.</p>
    <p>Tey de­cided not to en­gage its ser­vices as she felt that the fee was too steep. She later asked if Loo could help her in her per­sonal ca­pac­ity.</p>
    <p>Loo spoke to her mother in Septem­ber 2017, and they de­cided to ask Tey for $1,500 in ex­change for help­ing her with the PR ap­pli­ca­tion. Loo later told Tey that her “cousin” could help her, and Tey gave Teo $750 in cash on Sept 28, 2017. Tey handed her the re­main­ing $750 the fol­low­ing month.</p>
    <p>The court heard that Tey later “kept ask­ing” Teo about the sta­tus of her PR ap­pli­ca­tion.</p>
    <p>Teo then used her ac­count on ICA’s Cen­tral Iden­ti­fi­ca­tion and Reg­is­tra­tion In­for­ma­tion Sys­tem (Ciris) to check on the progress of the ap­pli­ca­tion even though she was not au­tho­rised to do so.</p>
    <p>Her of­fences came to light af­ter she asked a col­league on Oct 23, 2018, what a par­tic­u­lar sta­tus meant on the sys­tem and said that she was check­ing on a friend’s “PR sta­tus”.</p>
    <p>Teo’s su­pe­rior, who was alerted, then sus­pected that some­thing was amiss as such in­for­ma­tion could not be dis­closed to out­siders.</p>
    <p>ICA later con­ducted an au­dit on Teo’s Ciris ac­count and dis­cov­ered that she had per­formed multiple unau­tho­rised screen­ings in­volv­ing other peo­ple.</p>
