    <p>LON­DON • Fresh from two dom­i­nant tri­umphs, Lewis Hamil­ton will seek to com­plete an early-sea­son hat-trick and ex­tend his home wins record to seven with­out his usual im­pas­sioned sup­port­ers in “super weird” cir­cum­stances at this week­end’s Bri­tish Grand Prix.</p>
    <p>The driv­ers’ leader has al­ways drawn en­ergy from the big crowds that sup­ported him at Sil­ver­stone, but this year’s event will be run be­hind closed doors.</p>
    <p>“The Bri­tish Grand Prix is the best and that’s par­tic­u­larly be­cause of the fans – thou­sands and thou­sands al­ways turn up to cre­ate a great spec­ta­cle,” said the Bri­ton. “So, it is go­ing to be super weird to be there with­out them.”</p>
    <p>For the six-time world cham­pion, that means no crowd-surf­ing cel­e­bra­tions and keep­ing his feet on the ground as he bids to add to his wins from the Steier­mark and Hun­gar­ian Grands Prix as the coro­n­avirus­de­layed sea­son con­tin­ues.</p>
    <p>This Sun­day’s race will be the 71st Bri­tish Grand Prix and 54th at Sil­ver­stone and is fol­lowed one week later by a race at the same venue to cel­e­brate the 70th an­niver­sary of the in­au­gu­ral world cham­pi­onship event in 1950.</p>
    <p>After his re­cent vic­to­ries, and given his record at Sil­ver­stone, Hamil­ton will start as favourite, but can ex­pect a strong chal­lenge from his Mercedes team­mate Valt­teri Bot­tas, who won the Aus­trian Grand Prix sea­son-opener.</p>
    <p>Al­ready the two driv­ers have demon­strated the clear supremacy of their un­beaten W11 cars, dubbed “the fastest F1 cars ever” by team chief Toto Wolff this week.</p>
    <p>He said: “We will miss our fans at Sil­ver­stone – but we know that they will be root­ing for us from home so we are de­ter­mined to show our grat­i­tude by putting on a great show.</p>
    <p>“These are the fastest F1 cars ever built. They have bro­ken the track records at both Spiel­berg and Bu­dapest and it will be thrilling to see them on the iconic Sil­ver­stone cir­cuit.”</p>
    <p>The high-speed track’s de­mand­ing and fast cor­ners are ex­pected to suit Mercedes, but Wolff said he is tak­ing noth­ing for granted.</p>
    <p>“We re­solved the is­sues that trou­bled us on the first week­end, won three out of three races and scored a good amount of points, but they high­lighted a cru­cial fac­tor – the im­por­tance of re­li­a­bil­ity in this short­ened sea­son,” he said.</p>
    <p>“We’re one of only two teams that have fin­ished all the races with both cars this year and we know how quickly a DNF (did not fin­ish) can make a points lead dis­ap­pear.”</p>
    <p>Ar­riv­ing at Sil­ver­stone, Hamil­ton (63 points) leads Bot­tas by five with Max Ver­stap­pen of Red Bull third (33), but hop­ing to close the gap.</p>
    <p>The Rac­ing Point base is only a few hun­dred me­tres from the cir­cuit en­trance and, after demon­strat­ing their speed and po­ten­tial in Aus­tria and Hun­gary, they too hope to be in a scrap with Red Bull to se­cure a podium fin­ish be­fore Re­nault lodge an­other ex­pected protest at the in­tegrity of their “pink Mercedes” car.</p>
    <p>Fer­rari, the only team to have in­ter­rupted Mercedes’ supremacy at Sil­ver­stone when Se­bas­tian Vet­tel tri­umphed in 2018, are likely to con­tinue their strug­gle for com­pet­i­tive form after a lack­lus­tre start.</p>
    <p>“We know that from a pure com­pet­i­tive­ness point of view it will be dif­fi­cult, but we need to fo­cus on ac­quir­ing the best in­for­ma­tion pos­si­ble so that we can de­velop our car in the right di­rec­tion,” said its sport­ing di­rec­tor Lau­rent Mekies.</p>
