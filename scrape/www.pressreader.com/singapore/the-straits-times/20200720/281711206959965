    <p>MOSCOW • A top Rus­sian of­fi­cial has said his coun­try could roll out a vac­cine against Covid-19 as soon as Septem­ber, while deny­ing ac­cu­sa­tions that hack­ers work­ing for the coun­try’s in­tel­li­gence agency tried to steal sen­si­tive data from ri­val re­searchers in Bri­tain, Canada and the United States.</p>
    <p>“Rus­sia may be one of the first to pro­duce a vac­cine against the back­drop of the bil­lions that are be­ing in­vested in the US and all the pharma com­pa­nies work­ing on it,” said Mr Kir­ill Dmitriev, the chief ex­ec­u­tive of the gov­ern­ment-backed Rus­sian Di­rect In­vest­ment Fund (RDIF), which is fi­nanc­ing one of the coun­try’s ef­forts to de­vise a vac­cine. “It’s a lit­tle bit of a shock­ing story.”</p>
    <p>Pres­i­dent Vladimir Putin has made find­ing a vac­cine a top pri­or­ity as Rus­sia has recorded more than 750,000 Covid-19 cases, mak­ing it the fourth-most af­fected coun­try in the world. In Rus­sia’s race to be the first to find a vac­cine against Covid-19, it is tak­ing an ap­proach that would be shunned in other coun­tries, claim­ing it will know in just three months of tri­als whether its lead­ing can­di­date works.</p>
    <p>Rus­sia’s rapid ap­proach to vac­cine de­vel­op­ment dif­fers from that in Western Europe and the US, where re­searchers typ­i­cally run phase 3 tri­als for months to show safety and ef­fec­tive­ness. If Rus­sia pro­claims suc­cess in the hunt for a vac­cine be­fore other can­di­dates, it could cre­ate a world of du­elling vac­cines and geopo­lit­i­cal bat­tles over who gets sup­plies.</p>
    <p>Mr Dmitriev’s com­ments came after Bri­tain, Canada and the US said hack­ers work­ing with the group APT29, part of Rus­sian mil­i­tary in­tel­li­gence, had used mal­ware to try to seize vac­cine re­search. Moscow quickly re­jected the ac­cu­sa­tions as “ground­less”, and its am­bas­sador to London said in a Bri­tish tele­vi­sion in­ter­view yes­ter­day that the claims made “no sense”.</p>
    <p>But Bri­tish For­eign Sec­re­tary Do­minic Raab yes­ter­day said he was</p>
    <p>“ab­so­lutely con­fi­dent” in the al­le­ga­tion, brand­ing the be­hav­iour “out­ra­geous and rep­re­hen­si­ble”. He told Sky News: “We’re ab­so­lutely con­fi­dent the Rus­sian in­tel­li­gence agen­cies were en­gaged in a cy­ber at­tack on re­search and de­vel­op­ment ef­forts in or­gan­i­sa­tions in this coun­try and in­ter­na­tion­ally with a view ei­ther to sab­o­tage or to profit.”</p>
    <p>Mr Dmitriev said Rus­sia did not need to steal in­for­ma­tion from ri­val vac­cine de­vel­op­ers be­cause it had signed a deal with As­traZeneca to make the Univer­sity of Ox­ford’s Covid-19 vac­cine at R-Pharm, one of Rus­sia’s largest drug com­pa­nies.</p>
    <p>As­traZeneca said in a state­ment that Rus­sia will be­come one of the hubs for pro­duc­tion and sup­ply of the vac­cine to in­ter­na­tional mar­kets, with plans to ex­port doses to more than 30 coun­tries. Un­der the deal, the vac­cine vec­tor was trans­ferred to Rus­sia, where R-Pharm will pro­duce the fin­ished doses.</p>
    <p>Mr Dmitriev also said he is so con­fi­dent in Rus­sia’s lead­ing vac­cine can­di­date that he has taken it him­self and had his whole fam­ily vac­ci­nated, in­clud­ing his par­ents, who are in their 70s.</p>
    <p>The vac­cine, fi­nanced by RDIF and de­vel­oped by the state-backed Ga­ma­leya In­sti­tute in Moscow, has com­pleted a phase 1 trial in 50 peo­ple, all of whom are mem­bers of the Rus­sian mil­i­tary.</p>
    <p>The vac­cine is one of 26 ex­per­i­men­tal shots be­ing de­vel­oped in Rus­sia, Deputy Prime Min­is­ter Tatyana Go­likova said last Wed­nes­day. Ga­ma­leya’s can­di­date is a vi­ral vec­tor vac­cine based on a hu­man ade­n­ovirus – a com­mon cold virus – fused with the spike pro­tein of Sars-CoV-2 to stim­u­late an im­mune re­sponse.</p>
    <p>An­a­lysts have ques­tioned Rus­sia’s rushed un­ortho­dox ap­proach. “The cur­rent sit­u­a­tion with the vac­cine looks like a race and suf­fi­cient clinic test­ing hasn’t been done,” said Mr Sergey Shulyak, chief ex­ec­u­tive of­fi­cer at Moscow-based con­sult­ing com­pany DSM Group.</p>
