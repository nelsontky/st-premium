    <p>For Mr Adrian Gu­nadi, chief ex­ec­u­tive and co-founder of fin­tech com­pany In­vestree, the pan­demic has brought op­por­tu­nity from ad­ver­sity.</p>
    <p>Since In­vestree was founded in 2015, it has more or less pi­o­neered online lend­ing against re­ceiv­ables to busi­nesses that are too small for com­mer­cial banks to bother with.</p>
    <p>That would be most com­pa­nies in In­done­sia, and In­vestree will notch up US$200 mil­lion (S$266 mil­lion) in loans this year. By com­par­i­son, the firm shored up less than US$490 mil­lion in the last five years.</p>
    <p>And de­spite In­done­sia slip­ping into its first re­ces­sion since the late 1990s, In­vestree’s de­faults are run­ning at 1.2 per cent – about half the rate of the com­mer­cial banks.</p>
    <p>It ex­pects to be prof­itable at the end of next year – only a few months be­hind its pre-pan­demic tar­get.</p>
    <p>So it is not re­ally sur­pris­ing that it se­cured fi­nanc­ing, along­side ride-hail­ing giant Go­jek, as the pan­demic took hold in March – al­beit a much lower amount. In­vestree wrapped up US$23.5 mil­lion in fi­nanc­ing from Ja­pan’s MUFG bank and In­done­sia’s BRI Ven­ture. Go­jek had US$1.2 bil­lion.</p>
    <p>“We’ve made leaps and bounds,” Mr Gu­nadi told The Straits Times over a video­con­fer­enc­ing call.</p>
    <p>“We see oth­ers do­ing con­sumer fi­nance and lend­ing. We started with in­voice fi­nanc­ing. That helped us deepen our ex­per­tise and our ca­pa­bil­ity.”</p>
    <p>In a tough year, In­vestree was among a shrink­ing pool of com­pa­nies that man­aged to break through with in­vestors – other than “uni­corns” like Toke­pe­dia and Go­jek.</p>
    <p>That was a good thing be­cause 2020 has turned out to be a record year for In­done­sia’s tech sec­tor.</p>
    <p>Led by Go­jek’s US$1.7 bil­lion haul so far this year, the sec­tor’s ride-hail­ers, online lenders, e-com­merce sites and other busi­nesses raked in US$4.3 bil­lion in fi­nanc­ing dur­ing the nine months to Septem­ber. That is al­ready more than dou­ble last year’s tally, ac­cord­ing to data from man­age­ment con­sul­tancy Kear­ney.</p>
    <p>In Oc­to­ber, Sin­ga­pore’s Te­masek and Google ploughed a com­bined US$350 mil­lion into Toko­pe­dia. The e-com­merce giant, thought to be worth as much as US$10 bil­lion, said this week it has hired banks Mor­gan Stan­ley and Cit­i­group to help it go pub­lic.</p>
    <p>Last month, Mi­crosoft coughed up US$100 mil­lion for a piece of Toko­pe­dia’s ri­val Bukala­pak.</p>
    <p>Uni­corns are tak­ing a big­ger share of the pie as some in­vestors hedge their bets by shying away from start-ups, said Mr Sanath Bala­sub­ra­manyam of Kear­ney.</p>
    <p>“In­vestors are def­i­nitely bullish about In­done­sia but they’re cau­tious,” he said. “More in­vest­ment is go­ing to the sta­ble gi­ants.”</p>
    <p>Start-ups risk be­ing el­bowed out as in­vestors shelve their search for frothy val­u­a­tions in favour of con­crete busi­ness plans, he said.</p>
    <p>Said Mr Rama Mamuaya, founder and chief ex­ec­u­tive of start-up news site Dai­lyso­cial.id: “Be­fore the pan­demic, it was all about the val­u­a­tion game: How can this start-up’s val­u­a­tion dou­ble in the next round?”</p>
    <p>Ven­ture cap­i­tal flow­ing to non-uni­corns lev­elled off this year. Af­ter tre­bling be­tween 2018 and last year to more than US$900 mil­lion, it slipped to US$880 mil­lion this year, ac­cord­ing to Dai­lyso­cial.id data.</p>
    <p>“Now, VCs (ven­ture cap­i­tal­ists) put more weight on build­ing a sus­tain­able busi­ness, re­gard­less of the cap­i­tal in­jec­tion. Fi­nan­cial fun­da­men­tals are now a good thing to pay at­ten­tion to,” said Mr Mamuaya.</p>
    <p>In­vestree, which tends to han­dle loans in the tens of thou­sands of dol­lars, is homing in on govern­ment sup­pli­ers and mer­chants with a steady track record.</p>
    <p>Amid the Covid-19 pan­demic, it has latched on to govern­ment ac­qui­si­tion web­sites tar­get­ing fi­nanc­ing to med­i­cal sup­pli­ers and lo­gis­tics com­pa­nies.</p>
    <p>On e-com­merce plat­forms like Bukala­pak’s, they limit of­fers of fi­nanc­ing to mer­chants with at least six months of sales. Bukala­pak au­to­mat­i­cally deducts re­pay­ments from lender re­ceipts on be­half of In­vestree, help­ing to keep dead­beat bor­row­ers to a min­i­mum.</p>
    <p>In­vestree ex­pects reg­u­la­tory ap­proval early next year for joint ven­tures in the Philip­pines and Thai­land – its first for­ays abroad. The firm also ex­pects rapid growth af­ter that and – who knows? – maybe be­com­ing a uni­corn it­self.</p>
    <p>“We should be at warp speed when we get our li­cences,” said Mr Gu­nadi.</p>
    <p>MORE CAU­TIOUS</p>
    <p>Be­fore the pan­demic, it was all about the val­u­a­tion game: How can this start-up’s val­u­a­tion dou­ble in the next round?... Now, VCs put more weight on build­ing a sus­tain­able busi­ness, re­gard­less of the cap­i­tal in­jec­tion. Fi­nan­cial fun­da­men­tals are now a good thing to pay at­ten­tion to.</p>
