    <p>Al­le­ga­tions of ques­tion­able halal cer­ti­fi­ca­tion prac­tices by the Is­lamic Reli­gious Coun­cil of Sin­ga­pore (Muis) have been in­ves­ti­gated and the find­ings have been sub­mit­ted to the Gov­ern­ment, said Muis yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The coun­cil said in a re­lease that the find­ings of an in­de­pen­dent re­view panel tasked to re­view its cer­ti­fi­ca­tion process, as well as the find­ings of its own in­ter­nal in­ves­ti­ga­tion, have been sub­mit­ted to the Min­istry of Cul­ture, Com­mu­nity and Youth (MCCY). The out­come will be made known in due course.</p>
    <p>Muis added that while the out­come of the in­ves­ti­ga­tion is pend­ing, an of­fi­cer against whom the al­le­ga­tions were made has been re­moved from han­dling mat­ters re­lat­ing to the recog­ni­tion of for­eign halal cer­ti­fi­ca­tion bod­ies (FHCBs).</p>
    <p>FHCBs are or­gan­i­sa­tions Muis deems to have sim­i­lar stan­dards to its own when it comes to halal cer­ti­fi­ca­tion and whose prod­ucts are cer­ti­fied as halal, or fit for con­sump­tion by Mus­lims, when im­ported into Sin­ga­pore. These or­gan­i­sa­tions can earn thou­sands of dol­lars monthly by sell­ing ex­ported prod­ucts to Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>Since April, Muis has made sev­eral public state­ments in re­sponse to al­le­ga­tions by Hong Kong-based news out­let Asia Sen­tinel that the coun­cil showed favouritis­m in its recog­ni­tion of FHCBs. Other ar­ti­cles have been pub­lished re­peat­ing and fur­ther­ing the ac­cu­sa­tions.</p>
    <p>In re­sponse to these, Muis had said in June that an in­ter­nal in­ves­ti­ga­tion team, as well as an in­de­pen­dent re­view panel chaired by its deputy chief ex­ec­u­tive, Dr Al­bakri Ah­mad, had been es­tab­lished to re­view the al­le­ga­tions.</p>
    <p>Muis said yes­ter­day that it has been alerted to an on­line ar­ti­cle falsely at­tribut­ing re­marks to Dr Al­bakri and con­tain­ing sev­eral other in­ac­cu­ra­cies.</p>
    <p>The ar­ti­cle, whose ori­gin Muis did not iden­tify, also al­leged that in­di­vid­u­als who as­sisted in the coun­cil’s in­ves­ti­ga­tions were co­erced into sign­ing non-dis­clo­sure agree­ments be­fore sub­mit­ting ev­i­dence.</p>
    <p>The coun­cil de­nied this, and said that in­di­vid­u­als as­sist­ing in in­ves­ti­ga­tions were re­quested to sign such an agree­ment to safe­guard the con­fi­den­tial­ity of the in­ves­ti­ga­tion process. None of them ob­jected, added Muis.</p>
    <p>So­cial me­dia posts re­gard­ing the out­come of the in­ves­ti­ga­tion process are still cir­cu­lat­ing, cast­ing as­per­sions on the in­tegrity of the process, warned Muis.</p>
    <p>The coun­cil said: “This is ir­re­spon­si­ble. We ask that such par­ties cease do­ing so and al­low due process to take place. Muis will up­date on the in­ves­ti­ga­tion out­come af­ter the mat­ter has been con­sid­ered by the Min­istry of Cul­ture, Com­mu­nity and Youth.”</p>
    <p>In April, Hong Kong-based news out­let Asia Sen­tinel al­leged that a Muis of­fi­cial was be­ing in­ves­ti­gated for cor­rup­tion by the Cor­rupt Prac­tices In­ves­ti­ga­tion Bureau (CPIB), a claim a CPIB spokesman would nei­ther con­firm nor deny, cit­ing con­fi­den­tial­ity is­sues.</p>
    <p>Muis has clar­i­fied that key de­ci­sions on halal cer­ti­fi­ca­tion are not made by one per­son but by an in­de­pen­dent panel and that the cer­ti­fi­ca­tion of FHCBs is held to the same rig­or­ous stan­dards as the lo­cal cer­ti­fi­ca­tion pro­cesses.</p>
    <p>Muis added that while the out­come of the in­ves­ti­ga­tion is pend­ing, an of­fi­cer against whom the al­le­ga­tions were made has been re­moved from han­dling mat­ters re­lat­ing to the recog­ni­tion of for­eign halal cer­ti­fi­ca­tion bod­ies.</p>
