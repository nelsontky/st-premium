    <p>At least 80 per cent of Sin­ga­pore’s pop­u­la­tion would have to be vac­ci­nated to achieve herd im­mu­nity against Covid-19, said the Health Min­istry’s chief health sci­en­tist, Pro­fes­sor Tan Chorh Chuan.</p>
    <p>As­sum­ing the ef­fi­cacy of a Covid-19 vac­cine is 90 per cent, vac­ci­nat­ing 80 per cent of the pop­u­la­tion would mean that about 72 per cent of them would be­come pro­tected, he told The Straits Times on Wed­nes­day.</p>
    <p>Prof Tan strongly en­cour­ages ev­ery­one who is suit­able to get the vac­ci­na­tion be­cause this would pro­tect them and their loved ones with whom they are in close con­tact, and re­duce the like­li­hood of spread in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>“Where most of a pop­u­la­tion has im­mu­nity to the virus, this herd im­mu­nity in­di­rectly re­duces the risk of in­fec­tion for those who are not im­mune to it, thereby lim­it­ing in­fec­tion clus­ters,” he said.</p>
    <p>“The es­ti­mates for herd im­mu­nity vary gen­er­ally around 60 to 70 per cent of the pop­u­la­tion, but a vac­cine cov­er­age of at least 80 per cent would be pru­dent.”</p>
    <p>On Mon­day, Prime Min­is­ter Lee Hsien Loong dis­closed Sin­ga­pore’s Covid-19 vac­ci­na­tion plan in a tele­vised ad­dress, and said the first ship­ment of Covid-19 vac­cines by United States phar­ma­ceu­ti­cal gi­ant Pfizer and its Ger­man part­ner BioNTech would ar­rive be­fore the close of the year.</p>
    <p>Pri­or­ity for the first ship­ments will be given to health­care work­ers, those on the front lines, as well as el­derly and vul­ner­a­ble pa­tients, but there will be enough vac­cines for ev­ery­one by the third quar­ter of next year, said the Prime Min­is­ter.</p>
    <p>Prof Tan said el­derly peo­ple would in­clude those who are 60 years and older.</p>
    <p>“As this group is very large (close to a mil­lion peo­ple), plan­ning is on­go­ing for the vac­ci­na­tion roll­out, but it is likely that the el­derly in in­sti­tu­tional care set­tings such as nurs­ing homes will be pri­ori­tised,” he said on Wed­nes­day.</p>
    <p>If the el­derly and peo­ple with mul­ti­ple health prob­lems are vac­ci­nated, symp­to­matic in­fec­tion rates would fall sharply among these groups, who are at much higher risk of se­vere disease and death, and much more likely to need hospi­tal care if they be­come in­fected, he said.</p>
    <p>Pri­or­ity is also given to health­care work­ers and front-line per­son­nel, as vac­ci­na­tion would greatly re­duce the risk of health­care ser­vices suf­fer­ing if many health­care work­ers get sick and are not able to work.</p>
    <p>Front-line per­son­nel would in­clude non-med­i­cal work­ers at health­care fa­cil­i­ties, as well as peo­ple who are in­volved in quar­an­tine op­er­a­tion, or work­ing in bor­der con­trol, Prof Tan said.</p>
    <p>“Be­yond that, when a high pro­por­tion of the to­tal pop­u­la­tion has been vac­ci­nated, the risk of large out­breaks and su­per-spread­ing events would be markedly re­duced,” he added. Achiev­ing herd im­mu­nity against Covid-19 helps pro­tect those who can­not be vac­ci­nated be­cause of their age or their med­i­cal con­di­tions.</p>
    <p>These in­clude peo­ple with a history of ana­phy­laxis, or se­vere al­ler­gic re­ac­tions, who should not re­ceive the Covid-19 vac­cine at this time, said Prof Tan, as well as preg­nant women.</p>
    <p>It may not be ad­vis­able for pa­tients who have med­i­cal con­di­tions or are on drugs that sup­press the im­mune sys­tem to get the vac­cine, but more de­tailed guid­ance would be pro­vided for this group.</p>
    <p>In clin­i­cal tri­als for the vac­cine, el­derly peo­ple had sim­i­lar side ef­fects as younger adults, such as pain at the in­jec­tion site, headache, tired­ness and fever, but these were less com­mon and milder than for younger peo­ple, said Prof Tan.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore also has ad­vance pur­chase agree­ments for other vac­cines, in­clud­ing those by Moderna in the US and Si­no­vac in China.</p>
    <p>Where most of a pop­u­la­tion has im­mu­nity to the virus, this herd im­mu­nity in­di­rectly re­duces the risk of in­fec­tion for those who are not im­mune to it, thereby lim­it­ing in­fec­tion clus­ters...</p>
    <p>The es­ti­mates for herd im­mu­nity vary gen­er­ally around</p>
    <p>60 to 70 per cent of the pop­u­la­tion, but a vac­cine cov­er­age of at least</p>
    <p>80 per cent would be pru­dent.</p>
