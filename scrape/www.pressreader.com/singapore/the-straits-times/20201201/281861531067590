    <p>WASH­ING­TON • US Pres­i­dent-elect Joe Bi­den is ex­pected to name Ms Neera Tan­den, who was an ad­viser to pres­i­dent Barack Obama, as di­rec­tor of the White House bud­get of­fice, and econ­o­mist Ce­cilia Rouse as chair of the Coun­cil of Eco­nomic Ad­vis­ers this week, ac­cord­ing to a source.</p>
    <p>Mr Bi­den is also ex­pected to pick Mr Wally Adeyemo, se­nior in­ter­na­tional eco­nomic ad­viser i n the Obama ad­min­is­tra­tion, to serve as Dr Janet Yellen’s top deputy at the Trea­sury Depart­ment.</p>
    <p>Econ­o­mists Jared Bern­stein and Heather Boushey are ex­pected to be named as mem­bers of the Coun­cil of Eco­nomic Ad­vis­ers, the source said.</p>
    <p>Mr Bi­den has also picked Mr Brian Deese, an­other ad­viser to Mr Obama, to head the White House Na­tional Eco­nomic Coun­cil, the New York Times re­ported, cit­ing three sources.</p>
    <p>The Pres­i­dent-elect’s eco­nomic picks have been the sub­ject of a tug of war be­tween Demo­cratic cen­trists – who mainly want a re­turn to ex­per­tise and com­pe­tence – and pro­gres­sives – who want dra­matic steps to ful­fil a key Demo­cratic cam­paign prom­ise to make US cap­i­tal­ism fairer for all.</p>
    <p>The nom­i­na­tions of Ms Tan­den, Pro­fes­sor Rouse and Mr Adeyemo re­quire Se­nate con­fir­ma­tion.</p>
    <p>As in 2009 with Mr Obama, whom Mr Bi­den served as vi­cepres­i­dent, the in­com­ing ad­min­is­tra­tion will in­herit on Jan 20 a strug­gling econ­omy fac­ing se­ri­ous near-term chal­lenges.</p>
    <p>But this time, the eco­nomic blow dealt by the coro­n­avirus pan­demic has laid bare dra­matic wealth and racial dis­par­i­ties that pro­gres­sives want Mr Bi­den’s team to tackle swiftly. They have leaned hard on him to shun cor­po­rate lob­by­ists and pri­ori­tise di­verse picks.</p>
    <p>The eco­nomic se­lec­tions so far rep­re­sent “broad di­ver­sity, deep ex­per­tise, long Wash­ing­ton ex­pe­ri­ence”, said Mr Matt Ben­nett, co­founder of the cen­trist Demo­cratic political con­sul­tancy Third Way, and “a re­turn to com­pe­tence and san­ity”.</p>
    <p>But some pro­gres­sives have crit­i­cised the se­lec­tion of Mr Deese, a White House cli­mate of­fi­cial un­der Mr Obama and cur­rently an ex­ec­u­tive at Black­Rock, the world’s largest as­set man­ager.</p>
    <p>Mr Jeff Hauser, di­rec­tor of the Re­volv­ing Door Project, a group that scru­ti­nises cor­po­rate in­flu­ence in gov­ern­ment, said Black­Rock’s large stake in US pol­icy de­ci­sions might put pres­sure on Mr Deese to re­cuse him­self from some pol­icy mat­ters.</p>
    <p>“He will ei­ther be ab­sent from big chunks of his job or pro­ceed with­out re­gard to the con­flicts of in­ter­est,” Mr Hauser said.</p>
    <p>The ap­point­ment of Ms Tan­den, who heads the left-lean­ing Cen­tre for Amer­i­can Progress think-tank and sparred with the pro­gres­sive camp over her sup­port for for­mer sec­re­tary of state Hil­lary Clin­ton against Sen­a­tor Bernie San­ders in the 2016 Demo­cratic pres­i­den­tial race, is also likely to draw crit­i­cism from the left.</p>
    <p>Prof Rouse, a labour econ­o­mist at Prince­ton Univer­sity whose re­search has fo­cused on the eco­nom­ics of ed­u­ca­tion and tack­ling wealth in­equal­ity, is well-liked by pro­gres­sives. She pre­vi­ously served as a mem­ber of Mr Obama’s Coun­cil of Eco­nomic Ad­vis­ers.</p>
    <p>Prof Rouse has crit­i­cised the Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion’s eco­nomic re­sponse to the pan­demic, not­ing in an April Prince­ton Univer­sity pod­cast that small-busi­ness aid had fallen short. She also spoke in favour of more di­rect aid to work­ers through their em­ploy­ers, and ex­pressed con­cern about the im­pact the pan­demic would have on wors­en­ing in­come dis­par­ity.</p>
    <p>Mr Adeyemo was a se­nior White House na­tional se­cu­rity ad­viser for in­ter­na­tional eco­nom­ics dur­ing the Obama ad­min­is­tra­tion. He is cur­rently pres­i­dent of the Obama Foun­da­tion.</p>
    <p>Mr Bi­den’s eco­nomic agenda is likely to fo­cus on get­ting the coun­try past the coro­n­avirus cri­sis, as a health as well as eco­nomic is­sue.</p>
