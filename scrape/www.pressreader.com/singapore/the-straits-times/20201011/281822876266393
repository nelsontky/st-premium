    <p>WASH­ING­TON • US Sec­re­tary of State Mike Pom­peo has called for closer ties with In­dia as he warned of China’s grow­ing might on its doorstep, amid a flurry of diplo­macy be­tween the world’s two largest democ­ra­cies.</p>
    <p>“They ab­so­lutely need the United States to be their ally and part­ner in this fight,” Mr Pom­peo said on Fri­day, about his four-way meet­ings ear­lier last week in Tokyo with his coun­ter­parts from In­dia, Ja­pan and Aus­tralia.</p>
    <p>Mr Pom­peo told ra­dio host Larry O’Con­nor: “The world has awak­ened. The tide’s be­gun to turn. And the United States un­der Pres­i­dent Trump’s lead­er­ship has now built out a coali­tion that will push back against the threat.”</p>
    <p>“The In­di­ans are see­ing 60,000 Chi­nese sol­diers on their north­ern bor­der,” Mr Pom­peo told Fox News late on Fri­day, in fur­ther signs that a deadly mil­i­tary stand-off be­tween the world’s two most pop­u­lous coun­tries is far from cool­ing down.</p>
    <p>Ten­sions have soared be­tween In­dia and China since vi­o­lent handto-hand fight­ing in the Hi­malayan re­gion of Ladakh in June that left 20 In­dian troops dead. China has ac­knowl­edged suf­fer­ing ca­su­al­ties but has not re­vealed any fig­ures.</p>
    <p>Mr Pom­peo said each of the three ma­jor Indo-Pa­cific democ­ra­cies – In­dia, Aus­tralia and Ja­pan – which form the so-called Quad along with the US, is un­der threat from the Chi­nese Com­mu­nist Party.</p>
    <p>Fol­low­ing the Tokyo meet­ing, Mr Pom­peo will travel to New Delhi with De­fence Sec­re­tary Mark Esper for an­nual talks with their In­dian coun­ter­parts. Deputy Sec­re­tary of State Stephen Biegun will travel to In­dia this week to pre­pare the meet­ing, the State Depart­ment said.</p>
    <p>De­spite wide con­cerns about China, In­dia has his­tor­i­cally shied away from for­mal al­liances with out­side pow­ers.</p>
    <p>In another ra­dio in­ter­view on Fri­day, Mr Pom­peo also called on the Vat­i­can to be “se­ri­ous” in ad­dress­ing re­li­gious per­se­cu­tion in China. His re­marks come on the heels of a visit to Rome in which Pope Fran­cis did not meet him, with the Vat­i­can say­ing that the pon­tiff avoids such au­di­ences with for­eign dig­ni­taries dur­ing cam­paign pe­ri­ods.</p>
    <p>Vat­i­can of­fi­cials say they were taken aback by Mr Pom­peo’s pub­lic crit­i­cism of an open­ing to China led by Pope Fran­cis.</p>
    <p>The Chi­nese have now be­gun to amass huge forces against In­dia in the north... The world has awak­ened. The tide’s be­gun to turn. And the United States un­der Pres­i­dent Trump’s lead­er­ship has now built out a coali­tion that will push back against the threat.</p>
