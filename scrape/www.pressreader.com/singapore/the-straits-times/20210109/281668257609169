    <p>WASH­ING­TON • There were in­fa­mous white na­tion­al­ists and noted con­spir­acy the­o­rists who have spread dark vi­sions of pae­dophile Satanists run­ning the coun­try. Oth­ers were more anony­mous, peo­ple who had jour­neyed from In­di­ana and South Carolina to heed Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump’s call to show their sup­port.</p>
    <p>One per­son, a West Vir­ginia law­maker, had been elected to of­fice only last Novem­ber.</p>
    <p>All of them con­verged on the grounds of the US Capi­tol, where hun­dreds of ri­ot­ers crashed through bar­ri­cades, climbed through win­dows and walked through doors, wan­der­ing around the hall­ways with a sense of glee­ful des­e­cra­tion, be­cause, for a few breath­tak­ing hours, they be­lieved that they had dis­placed the very elites they said they hated.</p>
    <p>“We wanted to show these politi­cians that it’s us who’s in charge, not them,” said a con­struc­tion worker from In­di­anapo­lis, who is 40 and iden­ti­fied him­self only as Aaron. He de­clined to give his last name, say­ing: “I’m not that dumb.” He added: “We’ve got the strength.”</p>
    <p>As the coun­try sifts through the shards of what hap­pened in Wash­ing­ton on Wed­nes­day, what comes into fo­cus in the storm­ing of the Capi­tol is a jum­bled con­stel­la­tion of hard­core Trump sup­port­ers: a largely white crowd, many of them armed with bats, shields and chem­i­cal spray; some car­ried Con­fed­er­ate flags and wore cos­tumes of fur and horns in­spired by the dis­cred­ited QAnon far-right con­spir­acy the­ory; they were mostly men, but there were women too.</p>
    <p>Those who stormed the Capi­tol were just one slice of the thou­sands of Trump sup­port­ers who had de­scended on Wash­ing­ton to protest against the cer­ti­fi­ca­tion of Mr Joe Bi­den’s vic­tory last Novem­ber over Mr Trump.</p>
    <p>Their breach came with a con­fused and fren­zied en­ergy, fu­elled by the words of Mr Trump just min­utes be­fore and the fer­vour of the mob stand­ing be­hind them.</p>
    <p>Wash­ing­ton’s Metropoli­tan Po­lice Depart­ment said it had made no ad­di­tional ar­rests on Thurs­day con­nected to the ri­ot­ing, dur­ing which one woman was fa­tally shot by the Capi­tol Po­lice and a Capi­tol Po­lice of­fi­cer suf­fered in­juries from which he later died.</p>
    <p>On Wed­nes­day, the Metropoli­tan Po­lice de­tained 68 peo­ple, plus the 14 picked up by the Capi­tol Po­lice dur­ing the un­rest. Among them were a 60-year-old gun rights ac­tivist from Arkansas who was pic­tured sit­ting in Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s of­fice, men in tac­ti­cal gear tak­ing self­ies in the Ro­tunda and a woman in the House cham­ber, car­ry­ing a QAnon-in­spired sign about chil­dren.</p>
    <p>Some of those who had also surged for­ward in the crowd seemed to show a be­wil­dered won­der at what they were see­ing in front of them. A few re­marked on the op­u­lence of the Capi­tol build­ing and of­fices, a qual­ity that seemed to con­firm their sus­pi­cions about the cor­rup­tion of Wash­ing­ton.</p>
    <p>“Yeah, look at all this fancy fur­ni­ture they have,” said a man in a win­ter parka and red hat, stand­ing on the west side of the Capi­tol and peer­ing through the glass at empty desks, com­puter screens and er­gonomic chairs. Sev­eral peo­ple banged on the win­dows with their fists, in­clud­ing one man who shouted: “Put the cof­fee on!”</p>
    <p>One man hit his head, not see­ing the outer layer of glass was there – it was so clean.</p>
    <p>As peo­ple rushed in­side, there was a strange mix of con­fu­sion and ex­cite­ment, and the al­most com­plete lack of po­lice pres­ence in the be­gin­ning am­pli­fied the feel­ing of law­less­ness. They gawked at a place of wealth and beauty, adorned with art and mar­ble, a do­main of the pow­er­ful, and for a short while on Wed­nes­day af­ter­noon, the ri­ot­ers were in con­trol. For once, they felt, they could not be ig­nored.</p>
    <p>As the au­thor­i­ties try to iden­tify those in the mob, some will be less hard to pin down than oth­ers. The group in­cluded some well-known fig­ures from the con­spir­a­to­rial right, in­clud­ing Mr Jake An­geli, who has pushed the false QAnon claims that Mr Trump was elected to save the US from deep-state bu­reau­crats and prom­i­nent Democrats who wor­ship Satan and abuse chil­dren. He was pic­tured sit­ting in Congress in a Vik­ing hel­met and furs.</p>
    <p>Mr An­geli, who is known as the “Q Shaman”, has been a fix­ture in the pro-Trump protests in Ari­zona since the elec­tion, and there are in­di­ca­tions that he and other rightwing ac­tivists had planned to spark a con­fronta­tion with the au­thor­i­ties be­fore Wed­nes­day’s rally.</p>
    <p>There were also lead­ers from the Proud Boys, a far-right group whose par­tic­i­pants have es­poused misog­y­nis­tic and anti-im­mi­grant views, such as Mr Nick Ochs, a failed Hawaii state leg­is­la­ture can­di­date and mem­ber of a col­lec­tive called “Mur­der the Me­dia”.</p>
    <p>Mr Chris Hood and mem­bers of his Na­tional So­cial­ist Club, a neo-Nazi group, posted pho­tos on Tele­gram from out­side the Capi­tol on Wed­nes­day. And the Three Per­centers, a far-right armed group, were seen gath­ered in Wash­ing­ton’s Free­dom Plaza on Tues­day night, most wear­ing hel­mets and Kevlar vests adorned with the group’s sym­bol, a Ro­man nu­meral three.</p>
    <p>The mob came from the broader crowd, tens of thou­sands of Mr Trump’s most loyal sup­port­ers, many of whom had driven through the night, or taken buses with friends and neigh­bours, to watch him speak and be part of a day that many hoped would fi­nally hold some an­swers to what had been months of false claims that the elec­tion had been stolen. A num­ber of peo­ple in­ter­viewed said they had never been to Wash­ing­ton be­fore.</p>
    <p>Mr Eric Dark, 43, a truck driver from Bra­man, Ok­la­homa, who was tear-gassed when he got to the top of the steps to the build­ing said: “We had enough peo­ple; we could have torn that build­ing down brick by brick.”</p>
