    <p>If lo­cal doc­tors are right about their pa­tients’ life­style habits, many Sin­ga­pore­ans aged 25 to 45 could be in for a rough ride later in life.</p>
    <p>Th­ese folks tend to not ex­er­cise reg­u­larly, have poor eat­ing habits and drink a bit too much, thus rais­ing the risk of chronic ill­nesses such as di­a­betes and heart dis­ease, noted a re­cent sur­vey by Pru­den­tial Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>The in­surer wants to en­cour­age as many peo­ple as pos­si­ble to age healthily and post­pone the on­set of chronic diseases.</p>
    <p>Chief ex­ec­u­tive Den­nis Tan be­lieves that this is prob­a­bly the most ef­fec­tive way to stem the ris­ing cost of health i nsurance, which is a source of con­cern for many Sin­ga­pore­ans.</p>
    <p>He says: “Pre­ven­tion is key to pro­tec­tion and pre­ven­tive health­care is key to help­ing peo­ple stay healthy and fit in the long run.</p>
    <p>“If our cus­tomers are healthy, we, as a busi­ness, are healthy too.”</p>
    <p>While no­body en­joys fil­ing claims, in­sur­ers have be­come a neg­a­tive touch point of sorts for fam­i­lies when some­one is hos­pi­talised or dies.</p>
    <p>Pru­den­tial hopes to take a more proac­tive ap­proach by en­cour­ag­ing its cus­tomers to fo­cus on their health and well­ness early so that they are not bur­dened by in­creas­ing health­care costs.</p>
    <p>This is why the com­pany re­mains the only in­surer with a claim-based pric­ing ap­proach for health­care poli­cies.</p>
    <p>Much like the no-claim bonuses that ac­ci­dent-free mo­torists en­joy when they re­new their mo­tor in­sur­ance, Pru­den­tial re­wards healthy pol­i­cy­hold­ers by giv­ing them a 20 per cent dis­count on their pre­mium at the next re­newal.</p>
    <p>But this does not mean that the pre­mium will shoot up when there is a claim; each claim is as­sessed based on its quan­tum as well as whether the treat­ment is sought at the com­pany’s ap­proved panel of hos­pi­tals.</p>
    <p>Th­ese in­clude se­lected pri­vate hos­pi­tals such as Raf­fles and Mount Alver­nia, as well as all govern­ment hos­pi­tals.</p>
    <p>Mr Tan be­lieves that work­ing closely with Pru­den­tial’s health­care part­ners is a cost-ef­fec­tive way of pass­ing on sav­ings to cus­tomers, keep­ing their pre­mi­ums lower.</p>
    <p>Of course, the best way to lower health­care costs is to stay healthy for as long as pos­si­ble.</p>
    <p>This is why Pru­den­tial took the un­usual step of go­ing ahead with the launch of its Pulse app in April, dur­ing the Covid-19 cir­cuit breaker pe­riod.</p>
    <p>The ar­ti­fi­cial in­tel­li­gence-pow­ered app pro­vides users with round-the-clock ac­cess to health­care ser­vices and real-time health in­for­ma­tion with­out them hav­ing to pay a sub­scrip­tion fee.</p>
    <p>“By en­abling peo­ple to make in­formed choices and early life­style in­ter­ven­tions, we can help pre­vent, pro­tect and post­pone the on­set of costly and de­bil­i­tat­ing diseases,” Mr Tan says.</p>
    <p>He adds that there are plans to get more well­ness and health­car­ere­lated part­ners on board so that a fit­ness ecosys­tem can be built to ben­e­fit more peo­ple.</p>
    <p>“With Pulse, we are lever­ag­ing health tech­nol­ogy to help peo­ple live well for longer,” he says, not­ing that the app will even­tu­ally evolve to be­come an all-in-one ser­vice that ad­dresses health, wealth and busi­ness.</p>
