    <p>Dur­ing the worst phase of the pan­demic, many peo­ple won­dered if the prop­erty mar­ket would come to a screech­ing halt and re­sult in the great­est fall in prices since the turn of the mil­len­nium.</p>
    <p>How­ever, the mar­ket proved to be quite re­silient. And this did not come by sheer luck.</p>
    <p>First, gov­ern­ment in­ter­ven­tion through stim­u­lus pack­ages and jobs pro­tec­tion aid in­su­lated Sin­ga­pore­ans from the full brunt of the eco­nomic slow­down and min­imised the num­ber of peo­ple af­fected by re­trench­ments or busi­ness clo­sures.</p>
    <p>It was re­ported that around 150,000 jobs will be saved over these two years, with more than half of them by the Jobs Sup­port Scheme.</p>
    <p>Sec­ond, the loan re­pay­ment mora­to­rium helped to cush­ion the shock of job losses and these mea­sures col­lec­tively helped pre­vent the wide­spread dis­tress sale of homes.</p>
    <p>Statis­tics have shown that res­i­den­tial prop­er­ties make up a large chunk of the Sin­ga­porean house­hold bal­ance sheet, with the other com­po­nents be­ing in­vest­ments in fi­nan­cial prod­ucts, in­sur­ance and sav­ings.</p>
    <p>That de­vel­op­ers re­ceived an ex­ten­sion to project com­ple­tion times al­le­vi­ated some of their stress. As a re­sult, the mar­ket did not ex­pe­ri­ence mass re­duc­tion of prices just to move units.</p>
    <p>An­other fac­tor that helped was the low in­ter­est rate en­vi­ron­ment.</p>
    <p>An in­ter­est­ing trend has emerged over the past few crises – Sin­ga­pore­ans tend to plough more into their res­i­den­tial prop­er­ties. Per­haps this sig­nals that such prop­er­ties re­main an as­set class of choice in times of hard­ship.</p>
    <p>ROLE OF TECH­NOL­OGY</p>
    <p>The prop­erty mar­ket did take a pause at the start of the cir­cuit breaker pe­riod in April, when trans­ac­tions slowed. But once peo­ple got the hang of how to use the tech­nolo­gies avail­able, ac­tiv­ity restarted.</p>
    <p>Just as peo­ple turned to Web tool Zoom for their video­con­fer­enc­ing needs, de­vel­op­ers re­lied on dig­i­tal so­lu­tion providers such as Mat­ter­port to cre­ate vir­tual show-flats when phys­i­cal view­ings were dis­al­lowed dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker pe­riod that lasted al­most eight weeks.</p>
    <p>Dig­i­tal­i­sa­tion be­came a top pri­or­ity for the real es­tate in­dus­try.</p>
    <p>De­vel­op­ers cre­ated on­line and dig­i­tal mar­ket­ing col­lat­er­als. Agents learnt how to en­gage prospects us­ing vir­tual walk-throughs. An­a­lysts gave their take on the mar­ket via webinars.</p>
    <p>We wit­nessed the first vir­tual or re­mote bal­lot­ing and unit selection process, which al­lowed for sales to hap­pen with­out hav­ing the need for buy­ers to be phys­i­cally present at the show-flats.</p>
    <p>The digi­ti­sa­tion of sales doc­u­men­ta­tion also al­lowed for re­mote and ef­fi­cient pa­per­work pro­cess­ing.</p>
    <p>While most peo­ple wel­come the open­ing of show-flats af­ter the cir­cuit breaker ended, so­cial dis­tanc­ing guide­lines en­sured a max­i­mum num­ber of vis­i­tors at any one time.</p>
    <p>There is no doubt that vir­tual view­ings will re­main a use­ful tool for agents and the dig­i­tal­i­sa­tion of the real es­tate in­dus­try will con­tinue, and rightly so.</p>
    <p>SPIKE IN DE­MAND</p>
    <p>Past trans­ac­tion pat­terns in Sin­ga­pore showed that the an­nual un­der­ly­ing or core de­mand in both the new and re­sale mar­ket is about 9,500 and 9,000 units re­spec­tively.</p>
    <p>The spike in de­mand wit­nessed af­ter the cir­cuit breaker ended should be con­sid­ered more of “re­cov­ery buy­ing” than “re­venge buy­ing”.</p>
    <p>While the num­bers showed a strong re­bound, it is a climb up from a low base due to the paused mar­ket sit­u­a­tion in April and May.</p>
    <p>While the global econ­omy is def­i­nitely not out of the woods yet, the new year presents a much more op­ti­mistic eco­nomic out­look and Sin­ga­pore is likely to come out of the re­ces­sion with a strong show­ing.</p>
    <p>The low in­ter­est rate en­vi­ron­ment is also likely to per­sist for a while more.</p>
    <p>All fac­tors are point­ing to sus­tain­able home sales vol­umes and pric­ing lev­els next year.</p>
    <p>De­vel­op­ers have worked up an ap­petite for sites as their land bank de­pletes.</p>
    <p>Some of the sites on the con­firmed and re­serve lists of the Gov­ern­ment Land Sales pro­gramme could sat­isfy their hunger. These plum sites are ex­pected to en­cour­age ac­tive bid­ding and some con­fi­dent pric­ing lev­els could be achieved.</p>
    <p>For­eign buy­ers are also likely to re­turn to our shores next year. With a vac­cine in sight, bor­ders are likely to re­open soon, al­beit slowly and safely.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore’s abil­ity to keep the Covid-19 sit­u­a­tion un­der con­trol and the Gov­ern­ment’s ef­forts in com­pet­ing for and at­tract­ing for­eign di­rect in­vest­ments and for­eign tal­ent make this an at­trac­tive des­ti­na­tion for for­eign in­di­vid­u­als and busi­nesses to in­vest in real es­tate.</p>
    <p>It looks like Sin­ga­pore could end the year with about 9,500 to 10,000 new home sales and 10,000 to 10,500 re­sales.</p>
    <p>This in­di­cates that the mar­ket is ful­fill­ing the core de­mand lev­els and not any­thing spec­u­la­tive. Of course, low in­ter­est rates and de­vel­op­ers dan­gling in­cen­tives to en­cour­age sales helped.</p>
    <p>It took a pan­demic to make peo­ple re-eval­u­ate their pri­or­i­ties in their lives and in what they look for when buy­ing a home.</p>
    <p>Sud­denly, a hum­ble bal­cony with some plants has be­come a place of respite, and a quiet space to con­duct that Zoom call has be­come a lux­ury, es­pe­cially if that part of the room has an im­pres­sive back­ground.</p>
    <p>These changes are more likely per­ma­nent than tran­sient. It will be in­ter­est­ing to see how de­vel­op­ers take in­te­rior de­sign of liv­ing spa­ces to a new level.</p>
    <p>To those who say “never waste a good cri­sis”, it is good to re­mem­ber that there is al­ways an­other one com­ing.</p>
    <p>An in­ter­est­ing trend has emerged over the past few crises – Sin­ga­pore­ans tend to plough more into their res­i­den­tial prop­er­ties. Per­haps this sig­nals that such prop­er­ties re­main an as­set class of choice in times of hard­ship.</p>
