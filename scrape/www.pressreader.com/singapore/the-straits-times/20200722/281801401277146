    <p>LON­DON • US Sec­re­tary of State Mike Pom­peo dis­cussed ways to tackle China’s grow­ing might when he met Bri­tain’s Prime Min­is­ter Boris John­son yes­ter­day, a week af­ter Lon­don or­dered a purge of Huawei gear from its 5G mo­bile phone net­work.</p>
    <p>US Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump had ear­lier lauded the ban, claim­ing that he had forced Lon­don’s hand due to con­cern over China, which he con­sid­ers as the United States’ main geopo­lit­i­cal ri­val.</p>
    <p>Bri­tain has de­nied that it made the de­ci­sion un­der Amer­i­can po­lit­i­cal pres­sure.</p>
    <p>As Bri­tain tough­ens its stance on China due to its han­dling of the coro­n­avirus and a crack­down in Hong Kong, Mr Pom­peo’s visit is an at­tempt to stiffen Mr John­son’s re­solve and dangle the po­ten­tial re­ward of a post-Brexit free-trade deal, diplo­mats say.</p>
    <p>Mr Pom­peo, af­ter dis­cussing China with Mr John­son in the Down­ing Street gar­den, said it was a con­struc­tive visit.</p>
    <p>“Our two coun­tries’ long-stand­ing, strong bi­lat­eral re­la­tion­ship has laid the foun­da­tion for to­day’s can­did dis­cus­sion on is­sues rang­ing from 5G telecom­mu­ni­ca­tion to our ne­go­ti­a­tions for a US-UK free trade agree­ment,” he said.</p>
    <p>A Bri­tish sum­mary of the talks said the pair also dis­cussed China’s ac­tions in Hong Kong and its treat­ment of Mus­lims in Xin­jiang.</p>
    <p>Mr Pom­peo was also due to meet Hong Kong democracy ac­tivist Nathan Law and the city’s last Bri­tish gov­er­nor Chris Pat­ten.</p>
    <p>Re­cent months have seen Bri­tain edge ever closer to the US in its geopo­lit­i­cal tug-of-war with China.</p>
    <p>Mr John­son’s most dra­matic pol­icy re­ver­sal saw him last week or­der Bri­tish mo­bile providers to stop buy­ing 5G equip­ment from Huawei, the world’s big­gest tele­coms equip­ment maker, start­ing from next year and to re­move ex­ist­ing gear by 2027.</p>
    <p>The Chi­nese for­eign min­istry re­sponded by ac­cus­ing Bri­tain of be­com­ing “Amer­ica’s dupe”.</p>
    <p>Bei­jing says the West – in par­tic­u­lar the US – is gripped by anti-Chi­nese hys­te­ria and colo­nial think­ing about the com­mu­nist state.</p>
    <p>China, whose US$15 tril­lion (S$21 tril­lion) econ­omy is five times the size of Bri­tain’s, has said the de­ci­sion to ex­clude Huawei, the world’s big­gest tele­coms equip­ment man­u­fac­turer, will hurt Bri­tain’s econ­omy, set back trade and dis­cour­age in­vest­ment.</p>
    <p>Lon­don has also out­raged Bei­jing by of­fer­ing nearly three mil­lion residents of Hong Kong a path­way to Bri­tish cit­i­zen­ship in re­sponse to a highly con­tro­ver­sial se­cu­rity law that China im­posed on the former Bri­tish colony last month.</p>
    <p>Bri­tain fol­lowed that up on Mon­day by sus­pend­ing its ex­tra­di­tion treaty with Hong Kong and ex­tend­ing an arms em­bargo of “po­ten­tially lethal weapons” that had pre­vi­ously ap­plied only to main­land China.</p>
    <p>The range of steps taken by Mr John­son in the past month threaten to bring an early end to a “golden decade” in co­op­er­a­tion that former Bri­tish fi­nance min­is­ter Ge­orge Os­borne had promised dur­ing a visit to Bei­jing in 2015.</p>
    <p>De­spite Bri­tain’s re­cent align­ment with the US, how­ever, some ten­sions be­tween Lon­don and Wash­ing­ton re­main.</p>
    <p>Mr John­son is keen to avoid be­ing too closely as­so­ci­ated with Mr Trump – whose ap­proval in Bri­tain is lan­guish­ing at around 20 per cent – de­spite the “spe­cial re­la­tion­ship” be­tween the two his­tor­i­cal al­lies.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, US De­fence Sec­re­tary Mark Esper said yes­ter­day that he plans to visit China this year for talks on “cri­sis com­mu­ni­ca­tions”.</p>
    <p>Mr Esper, whose com­ments come as Wash­ing­ton takes an in­creas­ingly tougher stance against Bei­jing in the dis­puted South China Sea, said he had spo­ken to his Chi­nese coun­ter­part sev­eral times and hoped to make the trip by the end of the year.</p>
    <p>He told a se­cu­rity sem­i­nar that one of the goals of the trip would be to “es­tab­lish the sys­tems nec­es­sary for cri­sis com­mu­ni­ca­tions and re­in­force our in­ten­tions to openly com­pete in the in­ter­na­tional sys­tem in which we all be­long”.</p>
