    <p>LIS­BON • At a com­bined out­lay of €400 mil­lion (S$648 mil­lion), Ney­mar and Kylian Mbappe are the costli­est front pair­ing in his­tory.</p>
    <p>But nei­ther the Brazil nor France in­ter­na­tional – the two most ex­pen­sive play­ers – could find a way past Manuel Neuer as Bay­ern Mu­nich de­nied Paris Saint-Ger­main their first Cham­pi­ons League tro­phy.</p>
    <p>Both had chances to score, par­tic­u­larly in the first half, when the Ger­many cap­tain de­nied Ney­mar with an out­stretched l eg and when Mbappe shot straight at him.</p>
    <p>PSG coach Thomas Tuchel was forced to de­fend his star duo af­ter­wards, with Ney­mar end­ing the night in a flood of tears.</p>
    <p>“We want Ney­mar and Kylian to score but we can’t ask for it all the time,” said the Ger­man.</p>
    <p>“I am proud be­cause Ney still had a match with an in­cred­i­ble ca­pac­ity, he showed his men­tal­ity. For Kylian, it was dif­fi­cult, he suf­fered a se­ri­ous in­jury, missed a lot of train­ing. It was a mir­a­cle that he was with us at all.”</p>
    <p>As it was, Kings­ley Co­man, whose boy­hood club were PSG, grabbed the only goal in the sec­ond half as Bay­ern ran out 1-0 winners to land their sixth Euro­pean Cup.</p>
    <p>Lament­ing PSG’s in­abil­ity to take their chances, Tuchel said: “I am con­vinced that if we had scored the first goal, we’d win the game.</p>
    <p>“I had the im­pres­sion that the first goal would de­cide the fate of this fi­nal. We have to keep this qual­ity to con­tinue on this road.</p>
    <p>“We have (Key­lor) Navas, but Neuer was in top form. He took the goal­keep­ing game to a new level. Un­for­tu­nately for us.”</p>
    <p>Since the Qatari takeover in 2011, the French cham­pi­ons, who also landed the other two do­mes­tic tro­phies this sea­son, have had four coaches, in­clud­ing Tuchel.</p>
    <p>His pre­de­ces­sors were all sacked for fail­ing to de­liver the one piece of sil­ver­ware miss­ing from their tro­phy cab­i­net and there is spec­u­la­tion he will also pay the price af­ter two sea­sons of fail­ure.</p>
    <p>How­ever, Tuchel re­fused to com­ment on the ru­mours, claim­ing his con­tract runs un­til next sum­mer and he “didn’t know any­thing else”.</p>
    <p>PSG pres­i­dent Nasser Al-Khe­laifi was also tight-lipped about the coach’s fu­ture, say­ing: “I am very proud of my play­ers. We had a great sea­son, a great tour­na­ment. No­body thought we would go to the fi­nal.”</p>
    <p>PSG mid­fielder An­der Her­rera is hope­ful the own­ers will not make any rash de­ci­sions in the wake of another Euro­pean dis­ap­point­ment.</p>
    <p>“We have built some­thing im­por­tant. We have to stay to­gether and start the next dream next week,” said the Spain in­ter­na­tional.</p>
