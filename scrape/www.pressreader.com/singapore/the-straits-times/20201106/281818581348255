    <p>Aus­tralians are pre­par­ing for what will be a strange col­lec­tive ex­pe­ri­ence – work­ing from the of­fice again.</p>
    <p>Af­ter eight months of work-from-home ar­range­ments, em­ploy­ees are be­ing en­cour­aged to re­turn to the of­fice now that the coun­try is largely free of Covid-19. Sun­day was the first day since June with­out a com­mu­nity trans­mis­sion.</p>
    <p>In­dus­trial Re­la­tions Min­is­ter Chris­tian Porter said he wanted to see a speedy re­sump­tion of work­ing in the of­fice, but noted that in­di­vid­ual busi­nesses should de­ter­mine their own ar­range­ments.</p>
    <p>“As our econ­omy con­tin­ues to re­cover, it is im­por­tant that Aus­tralian work­places get back to nor­mal as quickly as pos­si­ble, which in­cludes get­ting staff back into the of­fice where it is safe to do so,” he told The Sun-Her­ald.</p>
    <p>The state of Vic­to­ria has largely sup­pressed its sec­ond wave af­ter a lengthy lock­down that is now eas­ing. Yes­ter­day marked six con­sec­u­tive days with­out com­mu­nity trans­mit­ted cases.</p>
    <p>Na­tion­ally, there were no com­mu­nity trans­mit­ted cases of Covid-19 recorded yes­ter­day, though the state of New South Wales has recorded six such cases in the past week. In to­tal, Aus­tralia recorded 27,634 cases and 907 deaths as of yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Aus­tralia has taken a cau­tious ap­proach to the pan­demic, in­clud­ing strict lock­downs, re­stric­tions on group gath­er­ings and in­ter­state travel, and a ban on in­ter­na­tional travel. The mea­sures brought the cen­tral busi­ness dis­tricts (CBDs) of Syd­ney and Mel­bourne to a stand­still and have taken a heavy toll on shops and food out­lets in city cen­tres.</p>
    <p>But Aus­tralians are now re­turn­ing to work. A sur­vey re­leased yes­ter­day by the Prop­erty Coun­cil of Aus­tralia showed that of­fice oc­cu­pancy rose last month in all cities, ex­cept in Mel­bourne. In Syd­ney, oc­cu­pancy went from 35 per cent in Septem­ber to 40 per cent last month, while in Perth, it went from 63 per cent to 77 per cent.</p>
    <p>Mel­bourne’s of­fice oc­cu­pancy dropped from 8 per cent to 7 per cent, but this is ex­pected to rise dra­mat­i­cally with the eas­ing of re­stric­tions.</p>
    <p>The coun­cil’s chief ex­ec­u­tive, Mr Ken Mor­ri­son, said busi­nesses have be­gun “re­boot­ing” their work­places. “This is en­cour­ag­ing news for the Aus­tralian econ­omy given the crit­i­cal role of CBDbased busi­nesses in sup­port­ing jobs and eco­nomic ac­tiv­ity. There is clearly scope for more peo­ple to re­turn in ev­ery city,” he said in a state­ment.</p>
    <p>But the large-scale re­turn to work is set to be grad­ual and will in­clude new mea­sures to en­sure so­cial dis­tanc­ing and en­able po­ten­tial con­tract trac­ing.</p>
    <p>Na­tional Aus­tralia Bank last week be­came one of the first ma­jor em­ploy­ers to en­cour­age staff to re­turn to the of­fice. But it also noted that “we will not be re­turn­ing to the way things were be­fore the pan­demic”. The firm will limit the num­ber of peo­ple us­ing lifts, ban com­mu­nal cut­lery, and in­tro­duce on­line book­ing of desks in lieu of hot-de­sk­ing.</p>
    <p>But many Aus­tralians may not be rush­ing back to the of­fice, even af­ter the Covid-19 threat re­cedes.</p>
    <p>A study re­leased last month by UNSW Can­berra and CQUniver­sity found 64 per cent of em­ploy­ees felt they had achieved more work­ing at home than in the of­fice. More than two-thirds wanted to con­tinue reg­u­larly work­ing from home for some of their hours. The find­ings were based on a sur­vey of 6,000 pub­lic ser­vants.</p>
    <p>“Managerial re­sis­tance to work­ing from home largely ap­pears to have been over­come, in­di­cat­ing that we may in­deed be wit­ness­ing a rev­o­lu­tion in how we work,” the study found.</p>
