    <p>From Mon­day, the con­tact trac­ing process will get a speed boost, with the start of the na­tion­wide dis­tri­bu­tion of the Sin­ga­pore-made TraceTo­gether to­kens.</p>
    <p>These free to­kens are more user­friendly for those un­fa­mil­iar with smart­phones, and will also help over­come sev­eral lim­i­ta­tions of the app, said ex­perts in tech­nol­ogy and pub­lic health.</p>
    <p>For one thing, the to­ken is in­de­pen­dent of any mo­bile plat­form, noted Mr K.K. Lim, head of cy­ber se­cu­rity, pri­vacy and data pro­tec­tion at Harry Elias Part­ner­ship.</p>
    <p>Now, users of cer­tain mo­bile phones – such as iPhones run­ning on older ver­sions of Ap­ple’s op­er­at­ing sys­tem or Huawei phones with­out ac­cess to Google’s Play Store – can­not run the app.</p>
    <p>Another plus point is that the to­ken is use­ful for se­niors who can­not af­ford a smart­phone or don’t know how to use one, as well as chil­dren who may not own such a phone.</p>
    <p>The to­kens help these groups to come on board the TraceTo­gether pro­gramme, Mr Lim said.</p>
    <p>The pro­gramme en­ables the au­thor­i­ties to iden­tify a per­son’s close con­tacts, if needed.</p>
    <p>Its success hinges on how widely it is used, said Pro­fes­sor Teo Yik Ying, dean of the Na­tional Univer­sity of Sin­ga­pore’s Saw Swee Hock School of Pub­lic Health.</p>
    <p>If only 20 per cent of Sin­ga­pore’s pop­u­la­tion is on board, it will be just 4 per cent ef­fec­tive. In other words, con­tact trac­ers us­ing the pro­gramme can ex­pect to pick up only four of a Covid-19 pa­tient’s 100 con­tacts, Prof Teo added.</p>
    <p>At present, the TraceTo­gether app has seen about 2.4 mil­lion down­loads, ac­count­ing for around 40 per cent of Sin­ga­pore’s pop­u­la­tion.</p>
    <p>But this is not enough as its ef­fec­tive­ness re­quires more peo­ple to be in­ter­act­ing, said Min­is­ter-in­charge of the Smart Na­tion Ini­tia­tive Vi­vian Balakrishn­an, who is also the For­eign Min­is­ter.</p>
    <p>The to­kens will be given to any res­i­dent who needs one, the Gov­ern­ment said ear­lier this week.</p>
    <p>They will be handed out from Mon­day at 20 com­mu­nity cen­tres and clubs in Jalan Be­sar and Tan­jong Pa­gar, ar­eas where the pro­por­tion of el­derly res­i­dents is higher.</p>
    <p>Es­tates such as Ang Mo Kio, Alju­nied, East Coast, Marine Pa­rade and Sengkang are likely to get their to­kens be­tween this month and next month, while res­i­dents in ar­eas such as Cle­menti, West Coast, Sem­bawang and Pasir Ris can ex­pect to get theirs be­tween next month and Novem­ber.</p>
    <p>Peo­ple can also go to any ac­tive dis­tri­bu­tion point to get their to­kens ahead of sched­ule. The col­lec­tion venues and tim­ings are listed on the To­kenGoWhere web­site. Dis­tri­bu­tion is ex­pected to be com­pleted by end-Novem­ber.</p>
    <p>“We have stag­gered the dis­tri­bu­tion of the TraceTo­gether to­kens to en­sure there is suf­fi­cient sup­ply as we move into more com­mu­nity cen­tres/clubs, and will pro­duce the num­bers ac­cord­ing to de­mand,” said a spokesman for the Smart Na­tion and Dig­i­tal Gov­ern­ment Group.</p>
    <p>Each to­ken is reg­is­tered in the user’s name, en­abling con­tact trac­ers to iden­tify peo­ple who have been in close prox­im­ity to a con­firmed Covid-19 case.</p>
    <p>But the user’s name, iden­ti­fi­ca­tion num­ber and cell­phone num­ber are not cap­tured in the to­ken. They are stored in a sep­a­rate computer sys­tem.</p>
    <p>When en­ter­ing a venue, TraceTo­gether app users scan the venue’s QR code on their mo­bile phones.</p>
    <p>To­ken users, how­ever, will have to get the venue staff to scan the QR code on their to­kens.</p>
    <p>Nei­ther the app nor the to­ken cap­tures data on the user’s ge­o­graph­i­cal where­abouts. In­stead, they work by ex­chang­ing short-dis­tance Blue­tooth sig­nals with other apps or to­kens nearby. This prox­im­ity data is en­crypted and stored for 25 days be­fore be­ing au­to­mat­i­cally deleted.</p>
    <p>But for the to­kens to suc­ceed, peo­ple have to use them, said ex­perts in­ter­viewed. “Just like wear­ing a mask, you’ve got to form the habit of car­ry­ing the to­ken when you go out,” Mr Lim said.</p>
