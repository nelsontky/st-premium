    <p>WASH­ING­TON United States Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump suf­fered mul­ti­ple le­gal set­backs in three key swing states on Friday, chok­ing off many of his last-ditch ef­forts to use the courts to de­lay or block Pres­i­dent-elect Joe Bi­den’s elec­tion vic­tory.</p>
    <p>In quick suc­ces­sion, Mr Trump was handed de­feats in Penn­syl­va­nia, Ari­zona and Michi­gan, where a state judge in Detroit re­jected an un­usual Repub­li­can at­tempt to halt the cer­ti­fi­ca­tion of the vote in Wayne County pend­ing an au­dit of the count.</p>
    <p>The le­gal losses came as Mr Bi­den was de­clared the vic­tor in Ge­or­gia and a day after an agency in the Pres­i­dent’s own De­part­ment of Home­land Se­cu­rity flatly con­tra­dicted him by declar­ing that the elec­tion “was the most se­cure in Amer­i­can his­tory” and that “there is no ev­i­dence” any vot­ing sys­tems mal­func­tioned.</p>
    <p>On Friday, 16 fed­eral pros­e­cu­tors who had been as­signed to mon­i­tor the elec­tion de­bunked claims of wide­spread fraud, say­ing in a let­ter to At­tor­ney-Gen­eral Wil­liam Barr that there was no ev­i­dence of sub­stan­tial ir­reg­u­lar­i­ties.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump’s bad day at the bar be­gan at dawn when news emerged that lawyers from Ohio-based law firm Porter Wright Mor­ris & Arthur had abruptly with­drawn from a fed­eral law­suit they had filed only days ear­lier on his be­half in Penn­syl­va­nia.</p>
    <p>The with­drawal fol­lowed in­ter­nal ten­sions at the firm about its work for Mr Trump and con­cerns by some lawyers that it was be­ing used to un­der­cut the in­tegrity of the elec­toral process.</p>
    <p>Then, shortly after noon, a lawyer for the Trump cam­paign ef­fec­tively dropped its so-called Sharp­ie­gate law­suit in Ari­zona.</p>
    <p>That law­suit had claimed that some bal­lots cast for Mr Trump were in­val­i­dated after vot­ers in Mari­copa County had used Sharpie pens, caus­ing “ink bleeds”.</p>
    <p>Lawyer Kory Langhofer ac­knowl­edged that not enough pres­i­den­tial votes were at stake in the case to af­fect the out­come of the race.</p>
