    <p>1 HOUGANG TOU MU KUNG</p>
    <p>• The tem­ple be­gan as a shrine in Lim Loh vil­lage at Au Kang fourth mile­stone in 1902, and is the old­est tem­ple in Sin­ga­pore ded­i­cated to the Nine Em­peror Gods.</p>
    <p>• Its cur­rent build­ing was built in 1921 in a tra­di­tional Hokkien ar­chi­tec­tural style (right).</p>
    <p>• It was gazetted a Na­tional Mon­u­ment on Jan 14, 2005, and re­mains well known for its grand cel­e­bra­tions dur­ing the an­nual Nine Em­peror Gods fes­ti­val.</p>
    <p>CHURCH OF THE NA­TIV­ITY OF 2 THE BLESSED VIR­GIN MARY</p>
    <p>• The church is the old­est place of wor­ship in the area, and it started in an at­tap struc­ture erected in 1853 that was later re­built in brick. It was then known as Church of St Mary and served the grow­ing Teochew Catholic pop­u­la­tion.</p>
    <p>• In 1901, the present-day Neo-Gothic church build­ing was con­structed, com­plete with pointed arches and ribbed vaults, and was re­named Church of the Na­tiv­ity of the Blessed Vir­gin Mary, as it is known to­day.</p>
    <p>• Sul­tan Ibrahim of Jo­hor do­nated a mar­ble statue (below) of the Im­mac­u­late Con­cep­tion of Mary to the church in 1946, which still stands in front of the church to­day.</p>
    <p>3 NEO KIAN GUAN CON­FEC­TIONERY & CAKES</p>
    <p>• The con­fec­tionery is famed for its tra­di­tional Hokkien and Teochew pas­tries, which in­clude wed­ding con­fec­tionery and spe­cial pas­tries used dur­ing re­li­gious fes­ti­vals.</p>
    <p>• The busi­ness was first started in Jalan Kayu in 1932, and named af­ter its founder, a Chi­nese im­mi­grant, who was an ap­pren­tice in a tra­di­tional con­fec­tionery in Nan An, China be­fore he moved to Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>4 THE SERANGOON KHIUNG JAI CO-VIL­LAGERS AS­SO­CI­A­TION</p>
    <p>• The Hainanese clan as­so­ci­a­tion bought its cur­rent site at 102 Lorong Ah Soo in 1979, but was of­fi­cially reg­is­tered in 1958.</p>
    <p>• It served mem­bers of the Hainanese com­mu­nity liv­ing in Lorong Ah Soo, and at one point in the mid-1900s had 400 mem­bers.</p>
    <p>• The as­so­ci­a­tion also nur­tured Hainanese cul­ture by set­ting up the Guang Yi opera troupe in 1964.</p>
    <p>5 RAMAKRISHN­A MIS­SION</p>
    <p>• The mis­sion in Sin­ga­pore, a branch of the Ramakrishn­a Or­der of In­dia, was es­tab­lished in 1897 by Swami Vivekanand­a, the main dis­ci­ple of Sri Ramakrishn­a, and fo­cuses on fos­ter­ing spir­i­tual be­liefs and car­ry­ing out so­cial ser­vice pro­grammes.</p>
    <p>• The plot of land it oc­cu­pies in Bart­ley Road was pur­chased in 1941.</p>
    <p>Soon af­ter, the mis­sion built a boys’ home to house des­ti­tute boys af­fected by the Se­cond World War.</p>
    <p>• It also built a tem­ple on its Bart­ley grounds in 1954. The tem­ple is mod­elled af­ter the mis­sion’s main tem­ple in West Ben­gal, and in­te­grates ar­chi­tec­tural fea­tures and mo­tifs from dif­fer­ent re­li­gions, such as Bud­dhism and Is­lam.</p>
