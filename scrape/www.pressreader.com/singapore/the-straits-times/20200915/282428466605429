    <p>Art by three gen­er­a­tions of Sin­ga­pore pain­ters will soon go on dis­play at The Arts House, al­beit in the vir­tual realm.</p>
    <p>Thanks to im­mer­sive 360-de­gree tech­nol­ogy, vis­i­tors can click on a Web link and use their mouse to nav­i­gate the old Par­lia­ment House, tak­ing in the colo­nial-era ar­chi­tec­ture as well as the 50 paint­ings on the walls. Dig­i­talised paint­ings on vir­tual walls, that is – the ac­tual works re­main with the artists.</p>
    <p>Art. Ac­cess. Ap­pre­ci­a­tion, as the ex­hi­bi­tion is called, runs from Fri­day to Sept 27 and is or­gan­ised by online com­mu­nity Art­podium.</p>
    <p>It fea­tures ab­stract, fig­u­ra­tive and land­scape works by 21 Sin­ga­pore artists from the sec­ond and third gen­er­a­tions and be­yond.</p>
    <p>The art­works are for sale and about a tenth of the pro­ceeds will go to It­sRain­ingRain­coats, an ini­tia­tive that ben­e­fits mi­grant work­ers in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>Art­podium’s founder Kavita Raha, 58, says she had lined up sev­eral phys­i­cal events this year, but was forced to can­cel them be­cause of the Covid-19 pan­demic.</p>
    <p>How­ever, she still wanted to sup­port the artists and keep art lovers and col­lec­tors en­gaged.</p>
    <p>“I re­alised soon enough that em­brac­ing tech­nol­ogy was go­ing to be the way for­ward... For a non­techie like me, this was both daunt­ing and ex­cit­ing at the same time, but I de­cided to take the plunge,”she says.</p>
    <p>She en­gaged two tech firms. This cost sev­eral thou­sand dol­lars, de­frayed by a Dig­i­tal Pre­sen­ta­tion Grant for the Arts from the Na­tional Arts Coun­cil.</p>
    <p>Co-cu­ra­tor Seah Tzi-Yan, di­rec­tor of arts train­ing and out­reach com­pany T.H.E.O. Arts Pro­fes­sion­als, says that while the show fea­tures some well-known names such as Boo Sze Yang, it also spot­lights artists who have not been seen much on the auc­tion or main­stream gallery cir­cuit, such as liv­ing sec­ond-gen­er­a­tion pain­ters Chang Chin Fai, Cris­tene Chang Hoei, Poh Siew Wah and Su­jak Rah­man.</p>
    <p>“We were also look­ing at work that was par­tic­u­larly up­lift­ing,” Ms Seah adds. These in­clude third­gen­er­a­tion artist Su­nar Sugiyou’s Lady With The Yel­low Um­brella and Danya Yu’s city scenes.</p>
    <p>Artist Cris­tene Chang Hoei, 77, is pre­sent­ing two oil-based mixed me­dia works in­spired by the sea.</p>
    <p>“I feel very close to the sea not just be­cause of my mem­o­ries of my child­hood and youth in the East Coast, but also be­cause of its po­etic and lit­er­ary force,” says Chang.</p>
    <p>“In both works, I tried to cre­ate cer­tain sen­sa­tions and qual­i­ties about the sea us­ing my home stu­dio press to pro­duce grooves and tex­tures on thick pa­per...</p>
    <p>“There are para­dox­i­cal el­e­ments – the sea has a so­lid­ity and mass that sug­gest an en­dur­ing pres­ence, but it is not static and al­ways mov­ing, es­pe­cially with chang­ing light.</p>
    <p>“I try to con­vey sub­tle tran­si­tions with many lay­ers of oil-based inks.”</p>
    <p>In the fu­ture, Ms Raha would like to or­gan­ise “hy­brid” ex­hi­bi­tions where phys­i­cal shows run con­cur­rently with vir­tual ones.</p>
    <p>“We put in so much ef­fort to cu­rate a show, but we don’t re­ally archive it. (Now) we can cap­ture ev­ery facet of the venue, each and ev­ery artist and each and ev­ery art­work. We can also mar­ket it glob­ally,” she says.</p>
