    <p>A for­mer pri­vate-hire driver from Grab has been ac­cused of sex­u­ally as­sault­ing and try­ing to rape a drunk 19-year-old pas­sen­ger in the car’s back seat.</p>
    <p>Tan Yew Sin, 46, went on trial in the High Court yesterday on one count each of at­tempted rape, sex­ual as­sault by pen­e­tra­tion and out­rage of mod­esty. He is ac­cused of com­mit­ting the of­fences in the early hours of May 19, 2018.</p>
    <p>The mar­ried fa­ther of three ad­mit­ted he had fon­dled the vic­tim, in­serted his fin­ger into her and tried to have sex with her in his Kia Carens but claimed she par­tic­i­pated in some acts, the High Court heard.</p>
    <p>Prosecutor­s said Tan’s likely de­fence is that he be­lieved that the wo­man con­sented to the acts.</p>
    <p>Deputy Public Pros­e­cu­tor Chew Xin Ying con­tended that the wo­man was clearly in­tox­i­cated and Tan must have known that she was not ca­pa­ble of giv­ing con­sent.</p>
    <p>The court heard that a male friend of the wo­man had booked a Grab car to pick her up from a bar at Sele­tar Aerospace Park and take her home to a con­do­minium at Jalan Loyang Be­sar. The friend told Tan that the wo­man was drunk.</p>
    <p>After the wo­man boarded Tan’s car, she lay down in the back seat and started cry­ing. Dur­ing the ride, Tan tried to en­gage her in con­ver­sa­tion but she did not re­spond.</p>
    <p>At her des­ti­na­tion, the wo­man could not en­ter the con­do­minium de­spite tap­ping her pouch against the card reader at the side gate. She be­gan cry­ing and Tan took her back to his car. Ac­cord­ing to him, she be­came ag­i­tated and banged her head against the win­dow, so he went to the back seat to con­sole her.</p>
    <p>He tried to have sex with her but could not per­form sex­u­ally, the court heard. He then drove to a more se­cluded area, got into the back seat again and fon­dled her, but she pushed him away. After some time, she re­gained some of her senses, and Tan helped her to get into the con­do­minium. But, in­stead of go­ing home, she went to a toi­let near the pool, left her things there and walked out of the condo.</p>
    <p>She was later found ly­ing on the the road by another pri­vate-hire driver who called the po­lice.</p>
