    <p>Higher stan­dards for ser­vice providers in the pet sec­tor can be ex­pected in the first half of next year, and dog re­hom­ing and adop­tion pro­cesses will also be im­proved, said the An­i­mal and Vet­eri­nary Ser­vice (AVS) yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>In ad­di­tion, AVS has stepped up ef­forts to ed­u­cate the pub­lic on how to take care of pets, said Min­is­ter of State for Na­tional De­vel­op­ment Tan Kiat How at the launch of new ed­u­ca­tional ac­tiv­i­ties and re­sources on an­i­mals.</p>
    <p>He added that AVS is re­view­ing li­cens­ing con­di­tions for pet board­ers and breed­ers, as well as look­ing into rais­ing the pro­fes­sion­al­ism of vet­eri­nar­i­ans, among other things.</p>
    <p>It has been con­sult­ing closely with key stake­hold­ers – such as an­i­mal wel­fare groups, pet busi­nesses and vet­eri­nar­i­ans – and will an­nounce more de­tails when ready.</p>
    <p>In Oc­to­ber, the multi-stake­holder Re­hom­ing and Adop­tion Work Group (Rawg) was formed to im­prove the pro­cesses, said Mr Tan.</p>
    <p>The group has been work­ing on guid­ing prin­ci­ples for dog re­ha­bil­i­ta­tion and train­ing, as well as mea­sures to en­hance the com­pe­tency and stan­dards of dog train­ers.</p>
    <p>The pub­lic can pro­vide feed­back on the new com­mu­nity stan­dards and guide­lines on re­hom­ing and adop­tion next year.</p>
    <p>The an­nounce­ments fol­low a holis­tic pet sec­tor re­view, which led to the im­ple­men­ta­tion of a one­time li­cence for ster­ilised pet dogs in Septem­ber to make it more con­ve­nient for own­ers to trace them.</p>
    <p>This re­view be­gan in Au­gust last year, af­ter two no­table pet deaths.</p>
    <p>In Jan­uary last year, a Shet­land sheep­dog was re­ported to have died while it was boarded at pet hotel Pla­tinium Dogs Club.</p>
    <p>Three months later, a Mal­tese, which was left in the care of pet board­ing and day-care ser­vice Board N’ Play, died af­ter a swim­ming in­ci­dent on Sen­tosa.</p>
    <p>In terms of pub­lic out­reach, AVS – a clus­ter un­der the Na­tional Parks Board (NParks) – has rolled out a range of ed­u­ca­tional pro­grammes and re­sources.</p>
    <p>From Jan­uary, pre-school­ers can in­ter­act with small mam­mals such as rab­bits and ham­sters and learn about them for free at the new An­i­mal Class­room at Jacob Bal­las Chil­dren’s Gar­den.</p>
    <p>Un­der adult su­per­vi­sion, chil­dren will be al­lowed to touch th­ese an­i­mals, de­pend­ing on the tem­per­a­ment of both, said Dr Chang Siow Foong, group di­rec­tor of pro­fes­sional and sci­en­tific ser­vices at AVS.</p>
    <p>Pre-schools can book this ac­tiv­ity by e-mail­ing AVS at least one month in ad­vance.</p>
    <p>This is among some of the new ini­tia­tives to en­cour­age re­spon­si­ble pet own­er­ship from a young age.</p>
    <p>Other ac­tiv­i­ties in­clude learn­ing trips for se­condary and ter­tiary stu­dents to AVS’ an­i­mal cen­tres like the Sem­bawang An­i­mal Quar­an­tine Sta­tion.</p>
    <p>AVS has also worked with the Min­istry of Ed­u­ca­tion and the Early Child­hood De­vel­op­ment Agency to in­te­grate lessons on an­i­mals into schools’ cur­ricu­lum and syl­labus.</p>
    <p>For ex­am­ple, books on pet care will be dis­trib­uted to all 1,700 pres­chool cen­tres by March.</p>
    <p>Mem­bers of the pub­lic can ac­cess free online re­sources on an­i­mals.</p>
    <p>AVS is in­creas­ing the fre­quency of we­bi­nars on an­i­mal health, wel­fare and be­hav­iour, start­ing with one to­day on what fac­tors to con­sider be­fore get­ting a pet.</p>
    <p>The we­bi­nars, fea­tur­ing AVS vets as well as pro­fes­sion­als in the pet industry, will be held every fourth Satur­day of the month.</p>
    <p>Videos on ba­sic care for pop­u­lar pets will also be rolled out next year.</p>
    <p>In ad­di­tion, AVS is in­creas­ing vol­un­teer­ing op­por­tu­ni­ties for peo­ple and com­pa­nies.</p>
    <p>One pi­lot scheme on an­i­mal-as­sisted in­ter­ven­tion in­volves pair­ing an­i­mals with in­di­vid­u­als to im­prove their psy­cho­log­i­cal and phys­i­o­log­i­cal wel­fare.</p>
    <p>Pi­lot ses­sions took place last month, with young peo­ple from an out­reach pro­gramme by Fei Yue Com­mu­nity Ser­vices paired with cats.</p>
    <p>In­di­vid­u­als and cor­po­ra­tions who wish to con­trib­ute to th­ese pro­grammes and re­sources can con­tact NParks’ reg­is­tered char­ity, Gar­den City Fund, or do so via online plat­form Giv­ing.sg</p>
    <p>Com­mend­ing the ini­tia­tives, Mr Tan said: “Be­ing a pet owner comes with many re­spon­si­bil­i­ties, not just to our pets but also to our neigh­bours and the wider com­mu­nity.</p>
    <p>“Hence, it is im­por­tant that we equip our­selves with the knowl­edge of how to take care of our pets.”</p>
    <p>HEAVY RE­SPON­SI­BIL­ITY</p>
