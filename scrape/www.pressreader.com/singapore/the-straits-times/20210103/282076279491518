    <p>Dur­ing my visit to my hair­dresser in Novem­ber, the con­ver­sa­tion in­vari­ably wan­dered off to our work, and how we were cop­ing amid the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>My stylist, a care­free and straight-talk­ing Malaysian work-per­mit holder in her 30s, made a com­ment that lin­gered with me: “Peo­ple in our line of work can­not bring our emo­tions with us to the job.”</p>
    <p>She ex­plained: As some­one in the ser­vice line who works with her hands, she has learnt to bri­dle feel­ings – ev­ery spark of anger or im­pa­tience that rises up in her could re­sult in the wrong snip or cut be­ing made, af­fect­ing the qual­ity of her work and po­ten­tially lead­ing to the loss of a cus­tomer.</p>
    <p>Go­ing to work then re­quires her to take a con­sciously mind­ful ap­proach that in­volves sep­a­rat­ing her own emo­tions about cus­tomers, de­mand­ing bosses or per­sonal trou­bles, to fo­cus on the task at hand, in or­der to en­sure that her cus­tomers leave sat­is­fied.</p>
    <p>Lis­ten­ing to her, I was struck and hum­bled by her ded­i­ca­tion to her craft and pro­fes­sional at­ti­tude, ex­hibit­ing a level of con­sci­en­tious­ness that I some­times for­get to main­tain in my own work.</p>
    <p>In the midst of the Covid-19 pan­demic, I also felt guilty that some­one like my hair­dresser has had to put up with more un­cer­tainty than an of­fice worker like me, de­spite her com­pe­tence and pos­i­tive work at­ti­tude.</p>
    <p>At the height of the pan­demic, hair sa­lons had to be shut for three weeks from late April to May, which meant she could not work dur­ing this pe­riod. I, how­ever, while barred from re­turn­ing to the of­fice, was able to work re­motely.</p>
    <p>As a Malaysian, my stylist has also not seen her fam­ily in Muar, Johor, for close to a year – tak­ing the trip across the bor­der would mean that she would need to serve a stay-home no­tice of 14 days when she re­turns, lead­ing to her miss­ing out on more days of work and in­come.</p>
    <p>En­coun­ters such as this one dur­ing the Covid-19 cri­sis have taught me this: We do not ap­pre­ci­ate or re­spect enough work­ers in man­ual jobs and care­giv­ing roles, who be­long to a more vul­ner­a­ble class of work­ers com­pared with those in white-col­lar pro­fes­sions.</p>
    <p>The is­sue of treat­ing those with dif­fer­ent skills dif­fer­ently was flagged in a book by Bri­tish writer David Good­hart ti­tled Head Hand Heart: The Strug­gle For Dig­nity And Sta­tus In The 21st Cen­tury. He sug­gests that some so­ci­eties suf­fer from a con­di­tion de­scribed as “peak head”, in which those with cog­ni­tive abil­i­ties (head skills) are val­ued more than those with tech­ni­cal and prac­ti­cal skills (hand skills), and those with so­cial and em­pa­thetic skills</p>
    <p>(heart skills).</p>
    <p>The pri­ori­ti­sa­tion of head skills alien­ates those with hand and heart skills, whose in­come and sta­tus fall be­hind that of other work­ers.</p>
    <p>Covid-19 has, to some ex­tent, up­ended that hi­er­ar­chy and made clear that the work of those with hand and heart skills are es­sen­tial and im­por­tant to us. Just think of the roles of clean­ers, rub­bish col­lec­tors, health­care and public trans­port work­ers, main­te­nance work­ers, driv­ers and de­liv­ery­men – they keep the coun­try func­tion­ing smoothly through­out the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Many peo­ple have since said that these jobs should be bet­ter re­spected and bet­ter paid. I agree and hope it will not take another cri­sis on this scale for us in­crease the value we at­tach to these jobs.</p>
    <p>An event I cov­ered as a jour­nal­ist in 2017 re­minded me how fal­la­cious it is to think that man­ual jobs are jobs for those who are less com­pe­tent.</p>
    <p>As some­one who had gone through the aca­demic route in school, I found it an eye-open­ing ex­pe­ri­ence to travel with stu­dents from poly­tech­nics and the In­sti­tute of Tech­ni­cal Ed­u­ca­tion (ITE) to Abu Dhabi to re­port on the bi­en­nial WorldSkill­s in­ter­na­tional com­pe­ti­tion that year.</p>
    <p>There, stu­dents from the ITE and poly­tech­nics show­cased their abil­ity to work with their hands and their hearts at the global com­pe­ti­tion of vo­ca­tional skills, from ex­pertly in­stalling and test­ing net­work ca­ble sys­tems that are needed by es­sen­tial busi­ness ser­vices, to look­ing af­ter pa­tients in long-term care set­tings.</p>
    <p>I knew from watch­ing their deft hands and pro­fes­sion­al­ism dur­ing the con­test that I would never be able to repli­cate what they have achieved.</p>
    <p>Wit­ness­ing for my­self the level of skill that is re­quired for these roles hum­bled me and con­vinced me that they should be given more recog­ni­tion. The events of this year have also fur­ther un­der­scored how greater aware­ness of such roles can help peo­ple give greater re­spect to work­ers in these jobs.</p>
    <p>One way to in­cul­cate a deeper ap­pre­ci­a­tion of these hand and heart skills would be to give stu­dents in aca­demic streams more ex­po­sure to what these skills en­tail.</p>
    <p>How about get­ting ju­nior col­lege stu­dents to be­come ap­pren­tices to se­nior ITE stu­dents for a week or so dur­ing their post-exam pe­riod, dur­ing which they can learn what it takes to pro­vide stel­lar restau­rant ser­vice at its train­ing restau­rant, or learn the ba­sics of how to in­stall and trou­bleshoot in­dus­trial equip­ment in fac­to­ries?</p>
    <p>Stu­dents from the ITE and poly­tech­nics can also col­lab­o­rate with univer­sity stu­dents on projects.</p>
    <p>In 2016, for in­stance, then Sin­ga­pore Man­age­ment</p>
    <p>Univer­sity (SMU) As­so­ciate Pro­fes­sor Mar­garet Chan mooted an ex­per­i­men­tal stu­dent the­atre project in which stu­dents from ITE, Repub­lic Polytech­nic and SMU worked to­gether to put up a the­atre pro­duc­tion.</p>
    <p>The polytech­nic and ITE stu­dents de­signed the set, cos­tumes, sound­scapes, and han­dled mar­ket­ing. SMU stu­dents acted and also served as crew mem­bers un­der ITE stage man­agers, who were trained in pro­fes­sional per­for­mance pro­duc­tion.</p>
    <p>Such a col­lab­o­ra­tion pro­vided a valu­able op­por­tu­nity for stu­dents to gain a bet­ter ap­pre­ci­a­tion of one another’s skill sets, recog­nis­ing that ev­ery­one’s ef­forts are in­stru­men­tal to the suc­cess of the pro­duc­tion.</p>
    <p>The Skill­sFu­ture move­ment has also en­cour­aged this shift to­wards a bet­ter ap­pre­ci­a­tion of hand and heart skills. More peo­ple in my gen­er­a­tion are now pick­ing up skills such as car­pen­try, farm­ing, cook­ing and sewing – in the process dis­cov­er­ing the sweat, dis­ci­pline and tal­ent it takes to ex­cel in these ar­eas.</p>
    <p>An ap­pre­ci­a­tion of work­man­ship will make all of us think harder about how pre­pared we are to pay for such work to be out­sourced to oth­ers, and to give credit to work­ers in these trades based on how skilled they are, in­stead of as­sign­ing value to such tasks based on ar­bi­trary and out­dated stereo­types.</p>
    <p>This could nar­row the gap in sta­tus and in­come be­tween pro­fes­sions re­quir­ing cog­ni­tive skills and those re­quir­ing such hand and heart skills.</p>
    <p>The pri­ori­ti­sa­tion of head skills alien­ates those with hand and heart skills, whose in­come and sta­tus fall be­hind that of other work­ers. Covid-19 has, to some ex­tent, up­ended that hi­er­ar­chy and made clear that the work of those with hand and heart skills are es­sen­tial and im­por­tant to us.</p>
