    <p>More help will be given to lo­cal mid-ca­reer job seek­ers to move into new roles in Sin­ga­pore’s bio­med­i­cal sci­ence sec­tor, even as the na­tion con­tin­ues to po­si­tion it­self as a re­gional hub to draw in in­vest­ments and jobs in this area.</p>
    <p>For ex­am­ple, some 300 pro­fes­sion­als, man­agers, ex­ec­u­tives and tech­ni­cians (PMETs) are ex­pected to ben­e­fit from an 18-month pro­fes­sional con­ver­sion pro­gramme launched yes­ter­day to pre­pare them for jobs in this sec­tor, which has re­mained a bright spot amid the re­ces­sion-hit econ­omy. These in­clude roles such as biotech­nol­o­gists, pro­duc­tion en­gi­neers and process de­vel­op­ment en­gi­neers.</p>
    <p>And even as Sin­ga­pore looks to build­ing up a skilled work­force in the bio­med­i­cal sci­ence in­dus­try, Trade and In­dus­try Min­is­ter Chan Chun Sing said yes­ter­day that ef­forts are also un­der way to an­chor this sec­tor here, to cre­ate new op­por­tu­ni­ties for busi­nesses.</p>
    <p>The Repub­lic will not com­pete with oth­ers based on the cost of its labour and land, or the size of its do­mes­tic mar­ket. In­stead, it will do so on other fronts which have be­come more im­por­tant amid this pan­demic, he said dur­ing a press con­fer­ence yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>These in­clude, for ex­am­ple, the na­tion’s abil­ity to pro­vide con­sis­tent and co­her­ent long-term poli­cies that pro­vide pre­dictabil­ity to in­vestors, its em­pha­sis on stan­dards and skills, its ge­o­graph­i­cal and dig­i­tal con­nec­tiv­ity, and its global out­look.</p>
    <p>“Sin­ga­pore adopts a proac­tive, for­ward-lean­ing pos­ture, and we will en­able all en­ter­prises here to keep their prom­ises to the rest of the global sup­ply chain,” he said.</p>
    <p>“We will not na­tion­alise any of this for our own pur­poses, nei­ther will we im­pose ex­port re­stric­tion for our own ben­e­fit, but to the detri­ment of the global sup­ply chain.”</p>
    <p>Asked how Sin­ga­pore will bal­ance this com­mit­ment with the needs of its pop­u­la­tion, such as in terms of vac­cine doses, Mr Chan said the two are not mu­tu­ally ex­clu­sive. “In fact, the more we are able to at­tract in­vest­ments to serve the global mar­kets, the greater the op­por­tu­ni­ties to se­cure ac­cess to all these crit­i­cal medicines and vac­cines and so forth for our own pop­u­la­tion.”</p>
    <p>A vac­cine co-de­vel­oped by Sin­ga­pore re­searchers is un­der­go­ing hu­man tri­als here. The Lu­nar-Cov19 vac­cine is one of 31 vac­cine can­di­dates glob­ally which have re­ceived ap­proval for tri­als on hu­mans. Some 142 other vac­cine can­di­dates are still at a pre-clin­i­cal stage.</p>
    <p>Mr Chan was speak­ing to the me­dia dur­ing a visit to the Asi­aPa­cific head­quar­ters of Amer­i­can med­i­cal tech­nol­ogy firm Bec­ton Dick­in­son, dur­ing which up­dates on the man­u­fac­tur­ing sec­tor – which bio­med­i­cal sci­ence falls un­der – were given. The bio­med­i­cal sci­ence sub-sec­tor con­tin­ues to be a bright spot in the Sin­ga­pore econ­omy, even though out­put from bio­med­i­cal man­u­fac­tur­ing can be volatile from month to month.</p>
    <p>Data out yes­ter­day showed that bio­med­i­cal man­u­fac­tur­ing out­put shrank 24.8 per cent last month com­pared with the same pe­riod last year, for a sec­ond straight month of de­cline.</p>
    <p>But the Man­power Min­istry had, in its job sit­u­a­tion re­port, noted that the sec­tor em­ploys around 25,000 work­ers and con­tin­ues to hire. The new pro­fes­sional con­ver­sion pro­gramme will help to meet this in­creased man­power de­mand, said Man­power Min­is­ter Josephine Teo, who was at yes­ter­day’s event.</p>
    <p>Work­force Sin­ga­pore and Sin­ga­pore Eco­nomic De­vel­op­ment Board worked with in­dus­try stake­hold­ers, as well as Sin­ga­pore Polytech­nic and Te­masek Polytech­nic, to de­velop the Pro­fes­sional Con­ver­sion Pro­gramme for Ad­vanced Bio­phar­ma­ceu­ti­cals Man­u­fac­tur­ing Pro­fes­sion­als and Ex­ec­u­tives.</p>
    <p>Trainees will un­dergo full-time train­ing, which com­prises three months of class­room train­ing at ei­ther of the two poly­tech­nics, and 15 months of struc­tured on-the-job train­ing at­tach­ment with host firms.</p>
    <p>The new scheme re­places the for­mer At­tach-and-Train pro­gramme for bi­o­log­ics man­u­fac­tur­ing, which was launched in Novem­ber 2018 and has helped 185 peo­ple en­ter the bio­med­i­cal sci­ence sec­tor.</p>
