    <p>TOKYO • Ja­pan has eased travel curbs for Sin­ga­pore, China and six other coun­tries as well as one re­gion, For­eign Min­is­ter Toshim­itsu Motegi said yes­ter­day, as Tokyo steps up ef­forts to re­vive its econ­omy while pre­vent­ing the spread of the coro­n­avirus.</p>
    <p>Ja­pan low­ered its in­fec­tion risk ad­vi­sory level for Aus­tralia, South Korea, Sin­ga­pore, Thai­land, China, New Zealand, Brunei and Viet­nam, as well as Tai­wan to Level 2 on its scale of four, telling its cit­i­zens to avoid non-ur­gent, non-es­sen­tial trips. Ja­pan pre­vi­ously is­sued a Level 3 alert for those ar­eas, warn­ing cit­i­zens against all travel.</p>
    <p>Mr Motegi said Ja­pan and Viet­nam have also agreed to restart re­cip­ro­cal busi­ness travel from to­mor­row, Ky­odo News agency re­ported. With the mea­sure, trav­ellers will no longer need to ob­serve a 14-day quar­an­tine upon ar­rival if they test neg­a­tive for Covid-19 and also sub­mit itin­er­ar­ies, among other mea­sures.</p>
    <p>Viet­nam is the third coun­try with which Ja­pan has re­sumed travel for peo­ple on short-term busi­ness trips, fol­low­ing Sin­ga­pore and South Korea.</p>
    <p>Last month, Sin­ga­pore and Ja­pan launched a “res­i­dence track” for busi­ness ex­ec­u­tives and pro­fes­sion­als who are work pass hold­ers, fol­low­ing a re­cip­ro­cal green lane, or “busi­ness track”, cater­ing mainly for short-term busi­ness trav­ellers and of­fi­cial travel be­tween both coun­tries.</p>
    <p>This will help re­store con­nec­tiv­ity and sup­port eco­nomic re­cov­ery for Ja­pan and Sin­ga­pore, both na­tions’ for­eign af­fairs min­istries said in an ear­lier joint state­ment.</p>
    <p>The “res­i­dence track” was to be done with the nec­es­sary pub­lic health safe­guards in place, said Sin­ga­pore’s Min­istry of For­eign Af­fairs. For the busi­ness track, safe­guards in­clude pre-de­par­ture and post-ar­rival test­ing, as well as the need to ad­here to a con­trolled itin­er­ary for the first 14 days in the re­ceiv­ing coun­try.</p>
