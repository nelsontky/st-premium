    <p>Mr Mo­hamed Sameer, a 30-yearold ju­nior of­fi­cer on a ship, spends two weeks out at sea be­fore re­turn­ing to shore for two weeks of rest.</p>
    <p>He wants to use those two weeks of downtime to sup­ple­ment his in­come by work­ing as a re­lief se­cu­rity guard for eight days, earn­ing about $100 to $120 daily.</p>
    <p>But he has to un­dergo train­ing first and must com­plete three mod­ules: threat ob­ser­va­tion (recog­nise ter­ror­ist threats); guard and pa­trol (pro­vide guard and pa­trol ser­vices); and in­ci­dent re­sponse (han­dle se­cu­rity in­ci­dents and ser­vices).</p>
    <p>The mod­ules, which take be­tween seven and eight days to com­plete, were the three most pop­u­lar for the first half of this year, said Skill­sFu­ture Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>Many of the course par­tic­i­pants con­tacted by The Straits Times had full-time jobs, but they said the train­ing to be a se­cu­rity guard was a back-up plan in case of a job loss, or as a way to sup­ple­ment their in­come amid the surge in de­mand for se­cu­rity of­fi­cers dur­ing the Covid-19 pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Hav­ing more peo­ple train­ing to be se­cu­rity of­fi­cers will help in meet­ing the rise in de­mand, said pres­i­dent of the Se­cu­rity As­so­ci­a­tion Sin­ga­pore (SAS), Mr Raj Joshua Thomas.</p>
    <p>He is, how­ever, un­con­vinced if many of those trained would re­main in the in­dus­try.</p>
    <p>“In the longer term, we ex­pect that th­ese new en­trants will move on to other jobs as the econ­omy re­cov­ers. In this re­gard, in terms of ca­reer build­ing and pro­fes­sion­al­ism, this is not a good trend,” he said.</p>
    <p>Mr Sameer, for ex­am­ple, is not look­ing for a full-time job in the se­cu­rity in­dus­try.</p>
    <p>“If it’s a more se­nior po­si­tion, maybe I’ll con­sider it, but it de­pends on the salary too,” he said, not­ing that the typ­i­cal monthly wage for a se­cu­rity of­fi­cer is far lower than that of a ship’s ju­nior of­fi­cer.</p>
    <p>Un­der the Min­istry of Man­power’s Pro­gres­sive Wage Model, se­cu­rity of­fi­cers of the low­est rank must be paid a ba­sic salary of at least $1,175 a month. This in­creases to at least $1,760 a month for a se­nior se­cu­rity su­per­vi­sor.</p>
    <p>To en­cour­age more peo­ple to en­ter the se­cu­rity sec­tor, some in­dus­try play­ers have called for al­low­ing job seek­ers to de­fer train­ing for po­si­tions at non-sen­si­tive sites.</p>
    <p>Mr William Adam Mor­ton Jr, di­rec­tor of Keith Mor­ton Se­cu­rity, in a let­ter to The Straits Times Fo­rum page last month, said this would lead to of­fi­cers be­ing im­me­di­ately em­ployed on a tem­po­rary ba­sis.</p>
    <p>They would be given a grace pe­riod of six months af­ter re­cruit­ment to at­tend the nec­es­sary train­ing, he wrote.</p>
    <p>Speak­ing to The Straits Times last week, Mr Mor­ton said the non-sen­si­tive lo­ca­tions could in­clude con­struc­tion sites “where the se­cu­rity just sits there and takes the tem­per­a­tures of peo­ple who are go­ing in”.</p>
    <p>“Any or­di­nary man can do that. As long as they are screened and they have no crim­i­nal con­vic­tions, why not,” he said.</p>
    <p>Re­spond­ing to the sug­ges­tion, Mr Thomas said the po­si­tion of the SAS is that train­ing is es­sen­tial for a se­cu­rity of­fi­cer to carry out his du­ties ef­fec­tively.</p>
    <p>Mr Sameer, who has com­pleted two of the three mod­ules so far, ap­pears to agree, say­ing that he found the train­ing use­ful thus far.</p>
    <p>“When­ever there’s an in­ci­dent, for ex­am­ple, if there’s a fire in a shop­ping mall, ul­ti­mately, the first responders are se­cu­rity guards who will be the ones to guide you to the exit,” he added.</p>
